WEBVTT

00:03.525 --> 00:05.222
There were two bags.

00:05.266 --> 00:07.398
One had money
and one had drugs.

00:07.442 --> 00:09.270
Where is it?

00:09.313 --> 00:10.097
What do you want me
to do with this guy?

00:10.140 --> 00:11.881
Dietrich: <i>Kill him.</i>

00:11.924 --> 00:13.100
No, no! No!

00:15.102 --> 00:17.539
Cereal?
It's my comfort food.

00:17.582 --> 00:19.628
My mom would let me eat it
when I was a good boy.

00:19.671 --> 00:21.064
Lindor: Anybody here?

00:23.936 --> 00:25.199
I got bear spray.

00:28.376 --> 00:30.987
How could
he have escaped?!

00:31.031 --> 00:32.336
I don't know.

00:32.380 --> 00:33.337
I'm gonna find him
before he does any damage.

00:33.381 --> 00:35.209
I believe
this belongs to you.

00:36.601 --> 00:38.081
Ren: Jag, meet Stone.

00:38.125 --> 00:39.343
Jag is here to --Oversee.

00:39.387 --> 00:40.649
That's not how
I'd put it.

00:40.692 --> 00:42.129
Jag:
Where is the money?

00:42.172 --> 00:43.434
I have a hunch.

00:43.478 --> 00:45.262
Any update on
the fingerprint job I gave you?

00:45.306 --> 00:47.873
Got prints off
the coffee cup.

00:47.917 --> 00:50.006
State has the key chain
from Harvey's crime scene.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.312
Waiting on them
to compare.

00:51.355 --> 00:52.226
Give them a nudge,
will you?

00:52.269 --> 00:53.488
I'm on it.

00:55.011 --> 00:56.317
Where's the money,
Maxie?

00:56.360 --> 00:58.319
Why don't you put down
the wrench?

00:58.362 --> 00:59.885
Did you come
for my daughter?

00:59.929 --> 01:01.148
Tell her to stop
looking for me.

01:01.191 --> 01:03.106
Son of a bitch!

01:05.152 --> 01:08.720
Phoebe?

01:08.764 --> 01:10.070
Hello, Ronald.

01:11.767 --> 01:13.029
Cassie:
What the hell?

01:14.509 --> 01:17.294
Dad?

01:29.393 --> 01:31.178
911 Operator: <i>
Are you still there?</i>

01:33.397 --> 01:35.791
<i>Hello?</i>

01:35.834 --> 01:38.098
<i>The police are almost there.</i> <i>
Are you still with me?</i>

01:42.363 --> 01:43.190
<i>Are you still there?</i>

01:45.235 --> 01:47.324
Officer:
Clear.

01:47.368 --> 01:49.500
Jenny:
Cassie?
Clear.

01:49.544 --> 01:51.023
Cassie?

01:54.070 --> 01:56.116
Cassie.

01:58.030 --> 01:59.945
Okay, come on.
Come here.

02:03.210 --> 02:04.428
Give me a hand!

02:04.472 --> 02:07.170
Whoa, whoa.
I got you.

02:09.259 --> 02:11.261
Come on. No.

02:15.874 --> 02:17.528
Wait --
Come on.

02:17.572 --> 02:19.965
Let's get you home.
Let's get you home.

02:36.243 --> 02:38.462
Joseph didn't go down
without a fight.

02:38.506 --> 02:39.898
Yeah.

02:39.942 --> 02:41.465
There's been
a couple reports

02:41.509 --> 02:44.207
of meth heads breaking into
local businesses.

02:44.251 --> 02:45.774
Back door lock
was tampered with,

02:45.817 --> 02:47.428
so that might be
what we're looking at.

02:47.471 --> 02:49.560
Doesn't seem like
anything was taken.

02:49.604 --> 02:52.433
And there's nothing of value
here to begin with.

02:52.476 --> 02:54.913
Well, a meth head
wouldn't know that,

02:54.957 --> 02:56.785
and crime of opportunity escalated.

02:56.828 --> 02:58.917
I'll have Denise
do an inventory.

02:58.961 --> 03:01.442
Maybe somebody was
looking for a file.

03:01.485 --> 03:03.618
Or maybe Joseph wasn't
the original target.

03:03.661 --> 03:05.446
What, you think someone
wanted to hurt Cassie?

03:05.489 --> 03:06.447
Could be.

03:06.490 --> 03:08.231
What was
she working on?

03:08.275 --> 03:09.928
She was
circling the cartel.

03:09.972 --> 03:12.235
If someone wanted
to leave a message...

03:14.846 --> 03:17.284
I'll park a car outside
her place around the clock.

03:18.850 --> 03:19.808
Thanks.

03:23.290 --> 03:24.943
Damn it.

03:49.098 --> 03:51.318
Here we are.

03:51.361 --> 03:55.931
We've got goats and chickens and
dogs that come when you call.

03:55.974 --> 03:58.934
It's our own little,
private slice of heaven.

03:58.977 --> 04:01.415
She looks scary.

04:01.458 --> 04:04.461
Oh, that's just
a trick of the light.

04:06.985 --> 04:09.945
How about a nice
cup of cocoa?

04:09.988 --> 04:12.556
You can put as many marshmallows
in it as you want.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.515
I want to see my mom.

04:14.558 --> 04:16.299
Of course you do.

04:16.343 --> 04:17.996
She's waiting for you.

04:23.611 --> 04:26.527
Are you bad people
like Ronald?

04:26.570 --> 04:29.312
No, Phoebe.
We're good people.

04:29.356 --> 04:31.532
Isn't that right,
Aggie?

04:31.575 --> 04:33.795
The best people
in the world.

04:36.450 --> 04:38.452
Now, come.
Let's go see your mother.

04:55.773 --> 04:58.210
You have made a mess, Ronald.

04:58.254 --> 04:59.995
A real mess.

05:06.436 --> 05:09.483
Time to fix it all up.

05:21.669 --> 05:24.585
Your mother's in here.

05:34.116 --> 05:35.422
Oh, Phoebe!
Mom!

05:35.465 --> 05:38.381
Oh, my God!
Thank you! Thank you!

05:40.427 --> 05:41.645
Where's Ronald?

05:41.689 --> 05:44.256
Wolf's taking care
of him.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.482
Hi. Come here.
Let me see you.

05:54.658 --> 05:56.312
Your hair's longer.

06:00.229 --> 06:01.796
The bad man
hurt Ronald.

06:01.839 --> 06:05.408
I'm sure Ronald
will be just fine.

06:05.452 --> 06:06.888
Are they going to
hurt me?

06:06.931 --> 06:08.803
No.

06:08.846 --> 06:10.587
No, they're not.

06:10.631 --> 06:12.154
Because you're
with your mom now,

06:12.197 --> 06:14.417
and I'm never going to let
anyone separate us ever again.

06:18.508 --> 06:20.554
I'm gonna get us
out of here.

07:10.647 --> 07:13.476
Hey.
Love you.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.608
I know you do.

07:19.743 --> 07:20.788
Kai: I miss Grandpa.

07:23.530 --> 07:24.618
Come here.

07:27.534 --> 07:29.666
I miss him, too, baby.

07:29.710 --> 07:32.321
Why did someone
want to hurt him?

07:32.364 --> 07:34.323
I don't know.

07:37.195 --> 07:39.415
Are you gonna
catch them?

07:41.591 --> 07:43.506
Yeah.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.421
I promise.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.423
I know you can do it, Mommy.

07:57.694 --> 08:00.175
Something really bad happened
at the dojo last night.

08:00.218 --> 08:01.524
That woman knows
we have her money.

08:01.568 --> 08:03.657
What did you tell
your teacher?

08:03.700 --> 08:06.398
I lied to him about
what's going on. Good.

08:08.052 --> 08:09.271
I think he can help us.

08:12.666 --> 08:14.798
Okay.
I'm telling Mom and Dad.

08:14.842 --> 08:15.712
They'll know what to do.

08:17.714 --> 08:20.412
Uh, no.
You absolutely cannot do that.

08:20.456 --> 08:21.849
So your sensei's
gonna save us?

08:23.677 --> 08:25.374
We just can't
tell Mom and Dad.

08:25.417 --> 08:28.116
We can still fix this.

08:34.862 --> 08:36.559
When you get to
your house,

08:36.603 --> 08:38.822
you tell your mother
you slept at a friend's,

08:38.866 --> 08:40.955
and you don't say
a single word about this,

08:40.998 --> 08:43.610
not to your mother,
not to anyone.

08:45.263 --> 08:46.961
Let's go.

08:47.004 --> 08:48.702
You're gonna show me where
the money is. Come on.

08:48.745 --> 08:50.399
No, I told you.
It's in Madison's room.

08:50.442 --> 08:51.966
Well, you're
coming with me.

08:52.009 --> 08:54.359
No!
Listen.

08:54.403 --> 08:59.756
I get the money and I'm out
of your life forever.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.758
That's what you've
always wanted, right?

09:01.802 --> 09:04.761
Come on. Come on.

09:10.637 --> 09:12.769
Pipe wrench
found near Joseph?

09:12.813 --> 09:16.468
Wiped clean. No prints.
- Not even Joseph's.
- And the door handle?

09:16.512 --> 09:18.949
Door lock jimmied, amateur in
nature, but again, no prints.

09:18.993 --> 09:20.472
And the blood work?

09:20.516 --> 09:21.822
So far,
only Cassie's dad,

09:21.865 --> 09:23.824
but I got the lab analyzing
digital samples.

09:23.867 --> 09:25.826
Report back as soon
as you get word.

09:25.869 --> 09:26.827
You got it.

09:33.747 --> 09:35.618
What?

09:35.662 --> 09:37.794
I want to keep
a tight circle on this.

09:37.838 --> 09:40.275
What if there's a connection
to the syndicate?

09:40.318 --> 09:43.844
Trooper Dewey had Cassie
under surveillance.

09:43.887 --> 09:45.323
It's not a terrible theory,
but at this point,

09:45.367 --> 09:46.847
everything's
still on the table.

09:46.890 --> 09:48.849
Look, we both know that was
not a random break-in.

09:48.892 --> 09:50.328
And so we need to be
extra careful

09:50.372 --> 09:51.634
in case this is
the work of the syndicate.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.680
I am done being careful. Hey.

09:53.723 --> 09:55.812
I need you to have
a clear head here, Jenny.

09:55.856 --> 09:57.727
Don't tell me
how to do my job.

09:57.771 --> 09:58.685
I'm just trying to
make sure you're not

09:58.728 --> 10:00.861
jumping to conclusions,
alright?

10:05.779 --> 10:07.824
How's Cassie doing?

10:07.868 --> 10:08.782
Not well.

10:08.825 --> 10:10.610
Yeah.

10:13.264 --> 10:15.266
We gotta get her
some answers.

10:18.052 --> 10:21.708
I'm gonna start with every
security camera on that block.

10:21.751 --> 10:22.926
You'll have the warrant
before lunchtime.

10:22.970 --> 10:24.058
Thank you.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.501
Where's Scarlet?

10:32.544 --> 10:33.633
She's with Phoebe.

10:37.941 --> 10:39.769
I hope you're gonna do
what we discussed.

10:39.813 --> 10:40.727
I need to talk to him first.

10:40.770 --> 10:42.816
Talk to him?
Why?

10:42.859 --> 10:44.513
I said I'll
take care of it.

10:44.556 --> 10:46.733
I will take care of it.
Everything will be fine.

10:46.776 --> 10:48.909
Everything is not fine, Wolf.

10:48.952 --> 10:50.171
Ronald killed a man.

10:50.214 --> 10:51.912
I know that!

10:56.351 --> 10:59.571
I've never put an animal
down this size.

10:59.615 --> 11:01.530
I don't know
the correct dose.

11:01.573 --> 11:03.532
A killing dose.
That's all you need.

11:06.578 --> 11:07.754
Do it.

11:07.797 --> 11:09.930
Or I will.

11:27.774 --> 11:28.862
Hello?

11:28.905 --> 11:31.734
Ren: <i>Hi, Bridger!</i>

11:31.778 --> 11:33.518
<i>You know who this is,</i> <i>
right?</i>

11:33.562 --> 11:35.738
Uh...uh, no.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.914
Word of advice, kid.

11:37.958 --> 11:39.437
<i>Leave the lying to</i> <i>
the professionals.</i>

11:39.481 --> 11:41.788
So, how do you
want to do this?

11:41.831 --> 11:43.790
"I would like my money, pretty
please, with sugar on top,"

11:43.833 --> 11:45.182
or did you want
the alternative

11:45.226 --> 11:46.880
with missing limbs
and dead parents?

11:46.923 --> 11:49.883
I already told you.
I-I don't have your money.

11:49.926 --> 11:51.754
<i>Do you really want me to</i> <i>
come back to your house?</i>

11:51.798 --> 11:53.930
I guess it could be fun.

11:53.974 --> 11:55.932
Big family dinner,
then a little murder party.

11:55.976 --> 11:57.934
You don't want to
do that.

11:57.978 --> 12:00.371
Why, you gonna hide behind
Sensei Porkchop again?

12:00.415 --> 12:02.939
I gotta go. <i>Yeah, you do.</i>

12:02.983 --> 12:06.029
<i>Look, kid, however you want</i> <i>
to do this,</i>

12:06.073 --> 12:07.770
you got 24 hours.

12:09.293 --> 12:11.208
Let's go.

12:11.252 --> 12:12.949
We have to give her
the money.

12:18.085 --> 12:20.478
No way. No.

12:20.522 --> 12:22.654
- Where the hell is it?!
- I don't know!

12:28.008 --> 12:29.400
Call Max and Harper.
Tell them to come over now!

12:29.444 --> 12:30.488
Okay, okay!

12:32.969 --> 12:34.231
We're so screwed.

12:51.945 --> 12:52.989
Hey!

12:53.033 --> 12:56.863
Where is Phoebe?!

12:56.906 --> 12:58.865
I am talking to you!

12:58.908 --> 13:00.997
Where is Phoebe?!

13:01.041 --> 13:02.303
Of course you are.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.397
I just wanted my family together.

13:09.440 --> 13:10.833
I was coming right back
to the ranch.

13:10.877 --> 13:12.835
Yet you didn't.

13:12.879 --> 13:14.881
You had to make
a little pit stop.

13:14.924 --> 13:16.926
It's all over
the news.

13:18.493 --> 13:20.190
I didn't mean
to hurt him.

13:20.234 --> 13:22.627
Right, you just wanted to
love him to death

13:22.671 --> 13:24.107
with that wrench,
isn't it?

13:24.151 --> 13:25.717
He came after me.

13:25.761 --> 13:27.328
Why?

13:27.371 --> 13:31.723
Why were you
even there?!

13:31.767 --> 13:34.117
You know why.

13:34.161 --> 13:37.642
Yes.

13:37.686 --> 13:39.862
It's nature.

13:39.906 --> 13:41.603
Not nurture.

13:43.474 --> 13:48.653
But you have betrayed my trust
for the last time.

13:48.697 --> 13:50.873
Look, j-j-just let me
out of here.

13:50.917 --> 13:53.136
We'll go away, and -- and
w-we'll never come back again.

13:53.180 --> 13:55.095
No.
No, I can't do that.

13:55.138 --> 13:58.098
There are no more mulligans.
No more do-overs.

13:58.141 --> 14:01.884
The only question now
is...how?

14:06.193 --> 14:09.587
In each spiritual journey,
there's a vigil.

14:09.631 --> 14:12.155
Take tonight,
think about what you've done,

14:12.199 --> 14:15.376
and tomorrow, I want to hear
about every victim --

14:15.419 --> 14:17.204
who they were
and where they are.

14:20.163 --> 14:22.905
Tell the truth...

14:22.949 --> 14:26.300
and you'll get the sweet sleep
of modern medicine.

14:26.343 --> 14:31.174
Lie to me, and you will feel
every last gasp of breath.

14:31.218 --> 14:34.090
No. Please.

14:34.134 --> 14:35.526
Please, no.

14:38.529 --> 14:40.183
Please.

14:40.227 --> 14:41.968
I have changed.

14:48.191 --> 14:49.149
No! Please! Please!

14:54.763 --> 14:56.852
Bridger:
What was she thinking?

14:56.896 --> 14:59.159
- I don't know.
- How could you?

14:59.202 --> 15:00.638
I-I wanted to call you,

15:00.682 --> 15:02.205
but T-Lock didn't let me
take my phone.

15:02.249 --> 15:03.815
I texted as soon
as I could.

15:03.859 --> 15:05.165
You broke
into our house.

15:05.208 --> 15:06.949
T-Lock made me.

15:06.993 --> 15:08.081
Right.

15:08.124 --> 15:10.170
Okay, you guys,
let's just calm down.

15:10.213 --> 15:11.649
It's not like Max
had a choice.

15:11.693 --> 15:14.304
This is so messed up.

15:14.348 --> 15:17.177
Why can't we just let T-Lock
take the fall for this?

15:17.220 --> 15:19.222
I mean, we really don't have
the money anymore.

15:19.266 --> 15:21.137
It's someone else's
problem now.

15:21.181 --> 15:23.183
That somebody's me!

15:23.226 --> 15:25.620
This is <i>my</i> problem!

15:25.663 --> 15:28.014
She threatened to kill
our family.

15:28.057 --> 15:29.798
For real?

15:29.841 --> 15:31.191
Yeah.

15:31.234 --> 15:33.193
This is your fault.

15:33.236 --> 15:36.196
- Hey, come on.
- You're not the only one whose life was threatened.

15:36.239 --> 15:37.849
How are we supposed to
believe that?

15:41.201 --> 15:42.506
Because I'm your friend.

15:44.856 --> 15:47.816
And I-I don't even know
where Tracy is right now.

15:53.256 --> 15:56.259
We can just tell this woman
that he has her money.

15:56.303 --> 15:58.000
You have no idea
what she's capable of.

16:00.611 --> 16:02.657
I can't believe you, Max.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.402
I need help.

16:08.445 --> 16:11.231
I just -- I just need
to tell someone.

16:11.274 --> 16:14.886
I can't --
I can't do this, guys.

16:14.930 --> 16:17.106
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I can't.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.632
Max, wait!

16:28.335 --> 16:30.032
Survivalist Bob: Where do you
want me to start?

16:30.076 --> 16:32.034
Stone or the Bhullars?

16:32.078 --> 16:34.080
Well, first, let's see if Stone
did what I told him to do.

16:41.913 --> 16:43.089
Is there
a dead man in there?

16:43.132 --> 16:47.528
Nope.
Just rats, and no T-Lock.

16:47.571 --> 16:49.095
Go on.

16:49.138 --> 16:51.053
Kill one,
for old time's sake.

16:51.097 --> 16:53.925
I find killing small things
helps focus the mind.

16:53.969 --> 16:56.232
Just find Stone.

17:13.380 --> 17:15.121
What the hell are you doing?

17:15.164 --> 17:16.339
Well,
I called you twice.

17:16.383 --> 17:18.298
I'm not gonna just
use the front door.

17:18.341 --> 17:21.083
I was in the shower.

17:21.127 --> 17:22.041
Yeah, I can see that.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.265
What's up?

17:29.309 --> 17:32.312
I heard about
Cassie's father.

17:32.355 --> 17:34.096
How's she doing?

17:36.316 --> 17:38.579
Cassie's numb...

17:38.622 --> 17:40.581
as you can imagine.

17:40.624 --> 17:42.322
And you?

17:42.365 --> 17:44.324
Me?
Yeah.

17:44.367 --> 17:46.761
Nothing else matters
until we find out who did this.

17:46.804 --> 17:50.156
Okay.
What's the going theory?

17:50.199 --> 17:53.550
Don't have much.
Maybe Ren Bhullar.

17:55.204 --> 17:57.511
She and Cassie
were butting heads.

17:57.554 --> 17:58.816
Was thinking of
starting there.

17:58.860 --> 18:00.122
Yeah.
Ren didn't do it.

18:02.342 --> 18:04.126
That sounds definitive.

18:04.170 --> 18:06.476
No, it's just
not her style.

18:06.520 --> 18:07.999
And besides,
I'm with her now, so...

18:08.043 --> 18:10.306
Meaning?

18:10.350 --> 18:12.221
Meaning I would know.

18:14.223 --> 18:17.183
Okay.

18:17.226 --> 18:21.143
Um...maybe Dietrich?

18:21.187 --> 18:23.493
Cassie did point a gun
at him.

18:23.537 --> 18:26.757
Mm, no. I don't see
that, either, though.

18:26.801 --> 18:29.151
So you have all
the answers here?

18:29.195 --> 18:30.413
I'm sorry. I'm just --

18:30.457 --> 18:32.241
I mean, maybe
it's a possibility.

18:34.287 --> 18:35.766
I know I'm grasping.

18:35.810 --> 18:40.293
It's... Cassie we're
talking about, so...

18:40.336 --> 18:42.033
Yeah, no, I get it.

18:42.077 --> 18:44.210
Look, I-I'm, uh...

18:44.253 --> 18:47.952
I'm gonna talk to
Dietrich, okay?

18:47.996 --> 18:50.433
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

18:50.477 --> 18:54.307
You sure you're okay?
You wanna...

18:54.350 --> 18:57.092
You want me
to stick around?
And do what?

18:57.136 --> 18:59.964
I mean, well, I can think
of about five things
right off the top.

19:00.008 --> 19:02.315
Mm. I think...

19:02.358 --> 19:04.752
Hmm?

19:04.795 --> 19:06.188
...I gotta wake up early.

19:06.232 --> 19:08.799
Hmm.

19:20.420 --> 19:22.204
Dad didn't give you
enough allowance

19:22.248 --> 19:23.336
to get your own dinner?

19:23.379 --> 19:25.990
Bridger Ryan.

19:26.034 --> 19:27.427
Ring a bell?

19:27.470 --> 19:29.385
All-American kid,
dabbles in karate,

19:29.429 --> 19:31.692
and stealing from
our family.

19:31.735 --> 19:34.216
I'm just curious as to why
you're dragging your feet.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.479
You gone soft?
Go ahead.

19:36.523 --> 19:38.220
Kill a kid.

19:38.264 --> 19:39.439
See how that goes.

19:39.482 --> 19:40.440
If you don't
have the balls to do it,

19:40.483 --> 19:42.398
have your lap dog
Donno do it.

19:42.442 --> 19:45.140
Set an example so we can
get out of Montana.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.881
This place
has opportunities.

19:46.924 --> 19:48.491
You know better.

19:48.535 --> 19:50.058
Dad's never gonna let you
set up shop here.

19:51.973 --> 19:53.496
Profit margins
on the real estate,

19:53.540 --> 19:56.151
transit lines,
proximity to the border --

19:56.195 --> 19:58.414
this place is it.

19:58.458 --> 20:01.243
But you know what's gonna
get us run out of town?

20:01.287 --> 20:03.506
Murdering a kid in
broad daylight.

20:03.550 --> 20:05.508
A kid with a very
sympathetic white face

20:05.552 --> 20:08.294
that you know is gonna
get on national news.

20:08.337 --> 20:11.427
A kid whose parents are lawyers
and have resources

20:11.471 --> 20:14.256
to hire a private investigator
like Cassie Dewell,

20:14.300 --> 20:17.172
who is already making my life
a living hell.

20:17.216 --> 20:20.262
So, what you think
is me being <i>soft</i>

20:20.306 --> 20:22.308
is me being smart, Jag.

20:24.571 --> 20:26.442
I'm not gonna let you ruin
what I'm setting up here.

20:26.486 --> 20:28.139
You don't get it.

20:28.183 --> 20:31.273
You can make $20 million down
here and it doesn't matter.

20:31.317 --> 20:33.319
<i>You</i> don't matter.

20:33.362 --> 20:35.451
You're a porcelain doll
on a shelf,

20:35.495 --> 20:37.453
but you know what happens
when you screw this up --

20:37.497 --> 20:40.282
and you inevitably will --
it falls on me.

20:40.326 --> 20:42.502
Dad is gonna blame me
for your mistakes

20:42.545 --> 20:45.200
just like he always does,
so know your place

20:45.244 --> 20:48.421
and take care
of business.

20:49.944 --> 20:51.902
Or I will.

21:00.171 --> 21:03.697
You know what's sad?

21:03.740 --> 21:05.351
I'm smarter than you.

21:05.394 --> 21:07.440
Go ahead, laugh.

21:07.483 --> 21:10.007
But Mom knew it.

21:10.051 --> 21:12.488
You know what she said
right before she died?

21:14.708 --> 21:16.318
She told me
that you and Dad

21:16.362 --> 21:18.494
were never gonna be able
to acknowledge it,

21:18.538 --> 21:21.018
but I know you
know it's true,

21:21.062 --> 21:23.934
and it kills you.

21:36.730 --> 21:38.253
I'm gonna call Dad.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.429
Of course you are.

21:56.184 --> 21:59.056
Narrator: <i>
Inside every bite is a memory,</i>

21:59.100 --> 22:01.842
<i>a time when everything</i> <i>
was okay.</i>

22:01.885 --> 22:05.367
<i>That comfort is</i> <i>
always within reach.</i>

22:05.411 --> 22:10.459
<i>It lives forever, inside</i> <i>
every box of Cocoa Chunks.</i>

22:10.503 --> 22:13.723
<i>♪ And pour a bowl,</i> <i>
just one bite</i>♪

22:13.767 --> 22:16.160
<i>♪ Now everything's gonna</i> <i>

22:16.204 --> 22:17.423
Woman: <i>Start your morning with</i> <i>
Cocoa Chunks,</i>

22:17.466 --> 22:18.989
<i>made with real chocolate...</i>

22:25.213 --> 22:26.388
Everything okay?

22:59.639 --> 23:01.641
I want to go home.

23:01.684 --> 23:04.818
This place is stranger
than Aunt Mary's.

23:04.861 --> 23:07.429
We will, honey.

23:07.473 --> 23:10.301
Mommy just needs to think
for a moment.

23:10.345 --> 23:13.217
She needs you
to be brave, okay?

23:19.485 --> 23:21.617
I made you
something to eat.

23:24.490 --> 23:26.666
Thank you.

23:26.709 --> 23:29.103
Hey.

23:29.146 --> 23:30.452
When can I
speak to Ronald?

23:30.496 --> 23:33.455
In time.
Agatha, please.

23:33.499 --> 23:34.717
Phoebe is
an innocent child.

23:34.761 --> 23:36.545
At least let her
out of this room.

23:36.589 --> 23:38.547
Don't talk to me
about innocence.

23:38.591 --> 23:41.115
You have jeopardized
everything we've built.

23:41.158 --> 23:42.333
What is Wolf
going to do?

23:42.377 --> 23:44.379
What's fair.

23:44.423 --> 23:47.730
Bad dogs face
bad consequences.

23:52.126 --> 23:53.519
Good night, Phoebe.

24:28.379 --> 24:29.642
I'm sorry, Aggie.

24:36.562 --> 24:38.520
The experiment is over, Wolf.

24:40.348 --> 24:43.351
You must put Ronald down.
Kill him.

24:43.394 --> 24:44.874
You have partners,
remember?

24:44.918 --> 24:47.529
If they get wind of this,
they will kill all of us.

24:47.573 --> 24:49.749
I can handle Milton.

24:49.792 --> 24:51.577
No, you can't.

24:51.620 --> 24:54.536
You need to do
what needs to be done.

25:02.718 --> 25:05.547
I'll do it after our
final session tomorrow.

25:12.598 --> 25:13.555
And Scarlet?

25:14.861 --> 25:16.427
What about her?

25:18.604 --> 25:21.563
I've seen inside her.

25:21.607 --> 25:23.609
Into her soul.

25:23.652 --> 25:26.960
And it is ugly

25:27.003 --> 25:29.745
and black as night.

25:29.789 --> 25:32.400
Just pl--

25:32.443 --> 25:37.710
Scarlet --
What about Phoebe?

25:37.753 --> 25:40.060
We will raise Phoebe.

25:41.409 --> 25:43.019
A child
needs her mother.

25:43.063 --> 25:45.369
Scarlet is
not a fit mother.

25:45.413 --> 25:48.808
We brought in
two monsters.

25:48.851 --> 25:51.767
We thought we could fix them
and we failed.

25:53.813 --> 25:56.380
It's time for them to be
removed from the world

25:56.424 --> 25:58.687
so they can't do
any more harm.

25:58.731 --> 26:03.823
This, um, violence
towards women...

26:03.866 --> 26:07.391
it's something Rick would do.

26:14.573 --> 26:17.401
Then leave her to me.

26:17.445 --> 26:21.797
You deal with Ronald,
and we...

26:21.841 --> 26:25.279
we will
pick up the pieces.

26:32.895 --> 26:35.071
I don't know.
It seems completely unrelated.

26:35.115 --> 26:37.639
Only two doors down.
Same amateurish lock-break.

26:37.683 --> 26:40.511
They smashed a window and
grabbed cash out of the safe.

26:40.555 --> 26:42.818
Nothing was wiped down.
Totally different MO.

26:42.862 --> 26:44.733
One thing I know
about meth heads --

26:44.777 --> 26:46.343
they like sugar
and shiny objects.

26:46.387 --> 26:49.520
Yeah, like staplers.
Not a single stapler missing.

26:49.564 --> 26:50.783
Denise's sugar bowl,
no one even touched it.

26:50.826 --> 26:52.828
- She's got the good stuff.
- That RV.

26:52.872 --> 26:55.265
I recognize it from
the security footage.

26:56.876 --> 26:58.834
It's been sitting there
for a while.

26:58.878 --> 27:01.010
Yeah?
Next up is the boot.

27:01.054 --> 27:03.709
Ever tell you about
the guy I caught

27:03.752 --> 27:04.927
trying to
cut the boot off?

27:04.971 --> 27:06.581
126 unpaid tickets.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.278
Just run the plates, please.

27:08.322 --> 27:09.845
Copy that.

27:15.198 --> 27:17.810
My parents,
they'd freak.

27:17.853 --> 27:20.334
A-And my friends...

27:20.377 --> 27:21.814
I don't know if I can
trust them anymore.

27:21.857 --> 27:24.599
You've been carrying
a heavy burden.

27:24.643 --> 27:28.037
I'm scared.
Help me.

27:28.081 --> 27:30.474
First thing you're gonna do is
wipe "scared" from your vocab.

27:30.518 --> 27:31.824
There's no place for it.

27:31.867 --> 27:33.739
Okay, but w-what
am <i>I</i> gonna do?

27:33.782 --> 27:35.741
We're going
full Chuck Norris.

27:35.784 --> 27:37.830
Okay, yeah.
We're gonna fight him.

27:37.873 --> 27:39.962
No. You got two lawyers
for parents.

27:40.006 --> 27:42.486
You tell them everything, have
them threaten legal action.

27:42.530 --> 27:44.271
The truest offense.

27:44.314 --> 27:46.926
I can't tell my parents.

27:46.969 --> 27:49.842
Just remember...

27:49.885 --> 27:51.800
unconditional love.

27:51.844 --> 27:53.933
That's what your parents
have for you.

27:53.976 --> 27:56.544
Confide in them,
and they will protect you.

27:56.587 --> 27:59.329
If you want,
I can be there when you do.

28:00.591 --> 28:01.854
Thank you, Sensei.

28:01.897 --> 28:03.333
You got this.

28:09.992 --> 28:12.429
Hang back.
I'll deal with this.

28:15.041 --> 28:16.956
Jag: Good afternoon.

28:16.999 --> 28:18.305
I'm sorry. We're closed
for my lunch break.

28:18.348 --> 28:19.959
Oh, it'll just
be a moment.

28:20.002 --> 28:21.308
We're looking for
Bridger Ryan.

28:21.351 --> 28:23.963
I don't know
who that is.
Sorry?

28:24.006 --> 28:25.442
I'm having a hard time hearing
you through the glass.

28:25.486 --> 28:27.967
I don't know who that is,
and we're closed.

28:28.010 --> 28:29.795
As in not open.

28:29.838 --> 28:31.927
You're welcome to come back
another time.

28:31.971 --> 28:35.322
Another time?

28:35.365 --> 28:37.759
Okay.

28:40.980 --> 28:42.938
No!

28:57.823 --> 28:59.389
Bridger.

28:59.433 --> 29:01.174
Is that you, buddy?

29:01.217 --> 29:04.003
We need to have a chat.

29:04.046 --> 29:09.008
See, I owe you an apology
on behalf of my sister.

29:09.051 --> 29:11.010
No need to be afraid.

29:23.936 --> 29:25.807
Dhruv, no!

29:25.851 --> 29:28.723
We need him alive

29:28.767 --> 29:30.986
to tell us
where the money is.

29:33.859 --> 29:36.949
Jenny: Okay, I got you
chicken noodle soup.

29:36.992 --> 29:40.039
Eat.
I'm not hungry.

29:40.082 --> 29:43.042
I know, but you've been planning
your dad's funeral nonstop.

29:43.085 --> 29:43.912
You need to eat something.

29:45.871 --> 29:47.437
What can you tell me?

29:49.048 --> 29:50.832
You promised.

29:50.876 --> 29:53.922
Look, Cassie, you don't need to
worry about the investigation.

29:53.966 --> 29:55.837
You just need to
get some rest.

29:55.881 --> 29:57.317
I promise, the minute
I hear anything,

29:57.360 --> 29:59.101
I'm gonna let you know.

30:04.280 --> 30:05.673
Hey.

30:05.716 --> 30:06.848
Jenny: Glad you're here.

30:06.892 --> 30:08.458
Maybe you can
get her to eat.

30:08.502 --> 30:10.765
Come in.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.723
Hey, I'm gonna
check in with you later.

30:12.767 --> 30:14.856
Okay.

30:19.905 --> 30:21.907
Hey.

30:21.950 --> 30:23.256
Hi.

30:27.129 --> 30:28.739
I'm sorry.

30:28.783 --> 30:31.090
I'm so sorry.

30:36.051 --> 30:37.923
I'm glad you're here.

30:40.055 --> 30:41.448
You wanna sit?

30:41.491 --> 30:42.753
Sure.

30:44.712 --> 30:47.149
Do you have
any idea what happened?

30:47.193 --> 30:49.891
Yeah, I think someone
was looking for me.

30:53.939 --> 30:55.114
What?

30:57.638 --> 31:00.162
Someone like
Ronald Pergman?

31:00.206 --> 31:03.078
What?
What are you saying?

31:03.122 --> 31:05.472
It's probably nothing.

31:05.515 --> 31:07.082
No, tell me.

31:07.126 --> 31:11.130
Wolf Legarski's ranch.

31:11.173 --> 31:14.350
When I was there,
I saw a box of cereal --

31:14.394 --> 31:16.700
Cocoa Chunks.

31:16.744 --> 31:18.398
Yeah.

31:18.441 --> 31:20.095
I know, it sounds
like nothing,

31:20.139 --> 31:22.489
but then I remembered

31:22.532 --> 31:24.795
I saw the same
type of cereal

31:24.839 --> 31:27.102
at this cabin Ronald might have
been hiding out at.

31:27.146 --> 31:29.061
He's been off the grid
for a long time.

31:29.104 --> 31:30.932
Why...

31:30.976 --> 31:33.804
I mean, why risk it?
Why now?

31:33.848 --> 31:34.675
I don't know.

31:36.764 --> 31:38.157
Yeah.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.723
Maybe I'm reaching.

31:39.767 --> 31:41.116
I -- I just --

31:41.160 --> 31:42.813
I had a feeling
at Legarski's ranch,

31:42.857 --> 31:44.946
and I have not
been able to shake it.

31:44.990 --> 31:47.383
I'm telling you,
something is off up there.

31:52.084 --> 31:53.563
Sorry.

31:53.607 --> 31:55.739
You have got a lot
on your plate.

31:55.783 --> 31:58.090
I just want you to know
I'm gonna pursue this.

31:58.133 --> 31:59.961
Whatever I find,
I'll tell you.

32:00.005 --> 32:01.441
If you want me to.

32:14.062 --> 32:15.846
You find Stone?

32:15.890 --> 32:17.152
Not yet.

32:17.196 --> 32:19.198
Staked out his place

32:19.241 --> 32:21.026
and that trailer where
the Bhullars talk shop.

32:21.069 --> 32:23.158
He'll show.

32:27.162 --> 32:28.163
Like I said.

32:30.861 --> 32:33.125
Hey, D.

32:33.168 --> 32:35.170
How you doin'?

32:35.214 --> 32:37.042
Doin' well.

32:37.085 --> 32:38.260
Follow me.

32:42.134 --> 32:43.831
Where you been?

32:43.874 --> 32:47.052
Where I been, I been handlin'
that thing you asked me to.

32:47.095 --> 32:49.402
Mm, T-Lock.

32:49.445 --> 32:52.057
He didn't
give you anything?

32:52.100 --> 32:53.406
No.

32:53.449 --> 32:57.149
You took him to the hole
and he said nothing?

32:57.192 --> 33:00.065
Okay, he asked
for forgiveness.

33:00.108 --> 33:01.370
For what?

33:01.414 --> 33:03.024
For his nickname.
I don't know.

33:05.287 --> 33:06.810
You know what is really
funny, though?

33:06.854 --> 33:08.638
Hmm?

33:08.682 --> 33:11.076
Is that I killed a man,
and then I get hassled by cops

33:11.119 --> 33:13.861
for a murder
that I didn't do.

33:17.169 --> 33:19.084
What murder's that?

33:19.127 --> 33:21.912
That PI that drew down on you
the other night?

33:21.956 --> 33:26.265
Yeah, her father
just got killed.

33:26.308 --> 33:28.049
You -- You get questioned,
or...?

33:28.093 --> 33:29.920
No.

33:29.964 --> 33:33.141
No reason to,

33:33.185 --> 33:36.275
and I don't know
anything about that.

33:43.282 --> 33:45.066
But I do know
about you, Stone.

33:45.110 --> 33:46.285
You're a traitor.

33:46.328 --> 33:47.547
Going to the Bhullars
behind my back.

33:47.590 --> 33:49.331
Okay, whoa, whoa, Dietrich.

33:49.375 --> 33:50.898
It's not what you think, man!
It's not what you think!
Huh?

33:57.687 --> 33:59.298
Maddie, are you here?

33:59.341 --> 34:01.126
In here, Bridger.

34:01.169 --> 34:02.997
Your sister
told us everything.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.260
Dad?

34:05.304 --> 34:11.005
Now, you need to tell me exactly
who was involved, who di--

34:15.836 --> 34:17.707
Hey. Hey.

34:17.751 --> 34:20.319
I messed up.

34:20.362 --> 34:23.452
I messed up so bad.

34:23.496 --> 34:25.324
Hey, hey, hey.

34:25.367 --> 34:27.369
Hey.

34:27.413 --> 34:29.328
Everything's
gonna be okay.

34:29.371 --> 34:30.111
We're gonna
take care of this.

34:30.155 --> 34:31.460
How?

34:34.289 --> 34:35.464
We'll figure
something out.

34:46.084 --> 34:47.737
Hey, you run the plates
on the RV yet?

34:47.781 --> 34:50.523
Yeah, registered to a guy
about 10 miles out of town.

34:50.566 --> 34:52.786
Reported stolen
from a gas station.

34:52.829 --> 34:55.136
Let's pull the gas station
surveillance video.

34:55.180 --> 34:57.007
Already on it,
but there's something else.

34:57.051 --> 34:59.488
- What?
- State compared the prints you sent in,

34:59.532 --> 35:02.143
the ones from the coffee
cup and the key chain from
Harvey's crime scene.

35:02.187 --> 35:03.536
And?

35:03.579 --> 35:05.015
Yeah, well,
they're a match.

35:06.582 --> 35:08.236
Okay.

35:08.280 --> 35:09.759
Wow.
Yeah, I know.

35:09.803 --> 35:12.371
Hey, you really think some kids
got the drop on Harvey?

35:12.414 --> 35:13.241
Only one way to
find out.

35:15.243 --> 35:18.159
There are two kids here
to see you in the lobby.

35:18.203 --> 35:19.073
What are the odds?

35:22.120 --> 35:23.991
Man:
Ready when you are.

35:24.034 --> 35:25.819
Woman: Alright, let me just
finish up on the computer.

35:29.605 --> 35:31.259
Hey.

35:31.303 --> 35:34.175
Um...we need your help.

35:34.219 --> 35:36.046
We did something wrong.

35:36.090 --> 35:39.180
Come on. My office.

35:39.224 --> 35:40.355
We'll sit down
and talk about it.

36:28.273 --> 36:30.797
I can't believe
he's gone.

36:30.840 --> 36:35.410
If you need any help with Kai,
just say the word.

36:35.454 --> 36:38.283
My Aunt Cathy's gonna
take him home with her.

36:38.326 --> 36:40.502
I can't risk
him being here.

36:40.546 --> 36:43.244
Not without knowing
who did this and why.

36:46.552 --> 36:49.642
Almost everyone
I love is gone.

36:55.430 --> 36:58.259
Whoever did this,
I'm gonna get them.

37:00.174 --> 37:03.395
