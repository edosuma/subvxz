Ugh!

00:13.500 --> 00:16.542
[Keane] I just spent two years
telling the country

00:16.542 --> 00:18.667
not to over-react
every time we hear a bang.

00:18.667 --> 00:20.667
[Emmons] This was
a lot more than a bang.

00:20.667 --> 00:22.500
When does my
chief of staff get here?

00:22.500 --> 00:23.583
It shouldn't be long.

00:23.583 --> 00:25.333
How do I talk to him
in the meantime?

00:25.333 --> 00:27.291
Communications
are still in process.

00:27.291 --> 00:29.333
I'm so important
I have no phone.

00:29.333 --> 00:31.125
Ma'am,
can I get you anything?

00:31.125 --> 00:32.417
My staff.

00:32.417 --> 00:34.041
What's going on?
Back up.

00:34.041 --> 00:36.166
The van that delivered
the bombs --

00:36.166 --> 00:37.583
Sekou was driving it.

00:37.583 --> 00:39.458
Well, hello.

00:39.458 --> 00:42.083
Her school is closed,
and I've got a crisis at work.

00:42.083 --> 00:43.875
You want me to babysit?

00:43.875 --> 00:45.041
Would you?

00:45.041 --> 00:48.750
It appears Iran is violating
the nuclear agreement.

00:48.750 --> 00:50.542
A parallel program
with North Korea?

00:50.542 --> 00:51.875
Is that what you're asking?

00:51.875 --> 00:55.208
Find out about Nafisi.
Get me the real answer.

00:55.208 --> 00:57.041
[Sekou]
His name is Saad Mahsud.

00:57.041 --> 00:58.417
He's working for the FBI.

00:58.417 --> 01:00.375
[Saad] I'm telling you,
he flat out refused.

01:00.375 --> 01:02.959
[Conlin] Were you wired up
when he said all that?

01:02.959 --> 01:06.750
Delete the recording.

01:06.750 --> 01:08.583
Sir, we're looking
for Carrie Mathison

01:08.583 --> 01:10.667
for comment on the attack.
Can you tell her?

01:10.667 --> 01:12.750
She's not here!

Wait. What?

01:17.792 --> 01:20.500
They're calling it
a hostage situation.

01:20.500 --> 01:22.083

They've been watching us.

-Across the street,

We have not yet reached

04:49.166 --> 04:51.291
a definitive judgment

04:51.291 --> 04:53.750
on whether the bomber
was working alone

04:53.750 --> 04:56.834
or if he had direct links
to the Islamic State.

04:56.834 --> 05:02.625
What we do know is that he was
a young man filled with hate...

05:02.625 --> 05:04.667
whom the FBI
had already arrested

05:04.667 --> 05:09.458
as a potential terror suspect
and then released,

05:09.458 --> 05:12.291
proving, once again,
how hard it is to interrupt

05:12.291 --> 05:15.250
the self-radicalization process

05:15.250 --> 05:19.792
and to identify extremists
before they turn to violence,

05:19.792 --> 05:23.542
which is why I am urging
my successor to join me

05:23.542 --> 05:25.500
in calling on Congress
to strengthen provisions

05:25.500 --> 05:29.083
in the PATRIOT Act
that will make that possible.

05:29.083 --> 05:31.291
More witch-hunts.
Great.

-I'm thinking it's safe.
-I understand your frustration,

05:44.500 --> 05:47.125
but the concern here is
continuity of government.

05:47.125 --> 05:48.583
Really? You really think
that's what's going on?

05:48.583 --> 05:51.333
It doesn't strike you as
extreme, my sequestration here?

05:51.333 --> 05:54.166
Ma'am, I was
in the White House on 9/11.

05:54.166 --> 05:57.375
We had to physically compel the
vice president to take shelter.

05:57.375 --> 05:59.333
Well, for once,
I understand his position.

05:59.333 --> 06:01.583
Leave that, please.
I want Rob Emmons here.

06:01.583 --> 06:03.458
You know, my chief of staff,
the one I can't reach

06:03.458 --> 06:06.667
because his name
was conveniently left off

06:06.667 --> 06:10.750

my so-called all-access phone.

06:10.750 --> 06:12.417
You think you can do that?

06:12.417 --> 06:13.166
I'll make it happen.

06:13.166 --> 06:17.041
[President Morse]
...will have

06:17.041 --> 06:18.959

06:18.959 --> 06:21.750
as they move ahead
in their investigation.

06:21.750 --> 06:24.667
We will use any and all measures
at our disposal

06:24.667 --> 06:28.542
to protect the freedoms
that we hold so dear.

-Conlin, wait.
-That, I promise.

06:30.583 --> 06:31.959
[President Morse]
Thank you.

06:31.959 --> 06:32.875
I said, "Wait."

06:32.875 --> 06:35.208
Doesn't seem wrong to you,
being here?

06:35.208 --> 06:37.667
I've been trying to reach you.
Did you get the photos I sent?

06:37.667 --> 06:39.708
Maybe. I don't know.
It's great seeing you.

06:39.708 --> 06:41.083
Come on, Conlin.
Have a look.

06:41.083 --> 06:43.667
We're all just trying to
figure out what happened here.

06:43.667 --> 06:45.417
It's pretty clear
what happened.

06:45.417 --> 06:47.041
No, I don't think so.
I don't even think you think so.

06:47.041 --> 06:49.375
Please.

-Not sure.

My cyber guy's been
trying to I.D. him.

So far,
we've come up empty.

07:04.834 --> 07:05.417
Where'd you get these?

07:05.417 --> 07:06.458

07:06.458 --> 07:09.500
The crazy vet who held
your daughter hostage?

07:09.500 --> 07:11.208
He thought he was
protecting her.

07:11.208 --> 07:12.417
Really?

07:12.417 --> 07:14.917
Honestly, I don't know what
this is -- a security guard.

07:14.917 --> 07:16.458
No, he's not.
I checked.

07:16.458 --> 07:19.208
Look, you've been on Sekou Bah
for close to a year.

07:19.208 --> 07:21.417
At the very least, you know
he didn't build that bomb.

07:21.417 --> 07:23.375
I'm betting the FBI doesn't
have a clue who did.

07:23.375 --> 07:25.250
Well, if you're thinking
it's him, you're wrong.

07:25.250 --> 07:27.375
How can you say that?
We don't even know who he is.

07:27.375 --> 07:29.458
I know he and Sekou
weren't working together.

07:29.458 --> 07:31.250
I'm not saying they were.

07:31.250 --> 07:32.708
What's that
supposed to mean?

07:32.708 --> 07:35.250
Maybe Sekou was unaware.

07:35.250 --> 07:37.250
Maybe he had no idea that bomb
was in the back of his van.

07:37.250 --> 07:40.333
Tell me you're joking.

07:40.333 --> 07:42.959
You really have no idea how
offensive you are, do you?

07:42.959 --> 07:44.959
Look, I just need help
getting to Quinn.

07:44.959 --> 07:47.458
Okay? To find out
what he saw that night.

07:47.458 --> 07:48.542
NYPD has got him in isolation
at Bellevue.

07:48.542 --> 07:51.041
Do you even listen
to yourself?

07:51.041 --> 07:52.959
You put that kid
back on the street.

07:52.959 --> 07:55.166
Live with it.

07:55.166 --> 07:57.625
Yeah, I am living with it,
but you live with this.

07:57.625 --> 07:59.875
Somebody made that bomb,
not Sekou,

is still out there.

You know Nate Joseph?

08:26.375 --> 08:28.375
-I don't believe I do.
-It's an honor, Mr. Berenson.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.083
-Nice to meet you.
-Can I get you anything?

08:30.083 --> 08:31.834
I'm fine. Thanks.
Section?

08:31.834 --> 08:33.250
-Counterterrorism.
-I see.

08:33.250 --> 08:34.875
I, uh -- I heard
your lecture, sir,

08:34.875 --> 08:37.667
during my training course --
Agent Handling in the Field.

08:37.667 --> 08:40.125
It was the highlight
of my whole two years, sir.

08:41.291 --> 08:42.834
Thank you.

08:42.834 --> 08:45.041
Uh, here.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.875
What is this?

08:51.875 --> 08:54.959
It's the updated briefing pack
you requested on the bombing.

08:54.959 --> 08:57.166
So far, no direct ties to any
foreign terrorist organizations.

08:57.166 --> 08:58.625
That's for someone else.

08:58.625 --> 09:01.875
-Excuse me?
-I didn't ask for this.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.125
I put in a request
for a surveillance file --

09:04.125 --> 09:05.542
on Tovah Rivlin.

09:05.542 --> 09:06.708
-Tovah Rivlin?
-Mossad.

09:06.708 --> 09:08.708
I just worked with her
in Abu Dhabi.

09:08.708 --> 09:11.834
I need to confirm
her contacts and travel

09:11.834 --> 09:13.125
for the 10 days prior.

09:13.125 --> 09:15.542
Shit. I do remember that
now -- your request.

09:15.542 --> 09:18.083
I meant to sign off, but
it's been all about the bomb

09:18.083 --> 09:20.875
the last couple of days.
It completely slipped my mind.

09:20.875 --> 09:21.708
What's the concern?
May I ask?

09:21.708 --> 09:24.333
No concern.
I just want to know

09:24.333 --> 09:26.583
who she's really been seeing,
not who Mossad says she has.

09:26.583 --> 09:29.625
I'm so sorry.
It'll take a day or two.

09:29.625 --> 09:33.708
-Can you live with that?
-If I have to.

09:33.708 --> 09:35.417
I'll get
right on it then.

09:35.417 --> 09:36.875
Again, my apologies.

about Israel?

that's running on a wire wheel.

The squirrel thinks
it's turning the wheel,

its feet get caught in the wires

14:31.792 --> 14:35.125

breaks its paws.

you sent me?

15:48.917 --> 15:51.583

of Sekou Bah.

15:51.583 --> 15:54.417

through NGI.

who he is.
