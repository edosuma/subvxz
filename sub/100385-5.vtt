00:10.381 --> 00:13.130
(theme music playing)

00:18.506 --> 00:19.798
Larry:
Hey!

00:20.798 --> 00:22.631
-Look what I got.
-Wow.

00:22.714 --> 00:25.673
My old glove.
Oh, baby doll.

00:25.756 --> 00:27.798
-I had this when
I was eight years old.
-Wow, man.

00:27.881 --> 00:30.005
Oh, my God.
Do you know how many errors
I made with this glove?

00:30.089 --> 00:31.798
-Shit.
-Never should have
played the infield.

00:31.881 --> 00:33.339
-I don't know why I did.
-Yeah, man.

00:33.422 --> 00:35.214
Yeah. Shortstop.
I can't play short.

00:35.297 --> 00:36.964
-Nah.
-I ran home,
I'd go home crying.

00:37.047 --> 00:38.839
Making errors every,
every time I played.

00:38.923 --> 00:40.881
It's hard playing infield
with polio, you know?

00:40.964 --> 00:44.422
-I don't have polio, asshole.
-Every kid with those
kind of gloves had polio.

00:44.506 --> 00:46.130
Well, you know what?
I'm throwing it out.

00:46.214 --> 00:47.589
Everything's going.
My-- I--

00:47.673 --> 00:49.130
Do you believe all this shit
my parents saved?

00:49.214 --> 00:51.172
I'm getting rid of all of it.
I can't stand it anymore.

00:51.255 --> 00:52.714
Should drop this shit off
at a nursing home.

00:52.798 --> 00:55.547
-Oh. Look at this thing.
-Oh, fuck.

00:55.631 --> 00:57.673
-My mother's mink stole.
-Shh...

00:57.756 --> 01:00.422
-Ooh, she loved this stole.
-Wow.

01:00.506 --> 01:02.464
-Fuckin' beautiful.
-Yeah. I can't throw this out.

01:02.547 --> 01:03.798
I'm sending it
to the dry cleaner.

01:03.881 --> 01:05.464
Those are making
a big comeback, too.

01:05.547 --> 01:06.964
-Comeback?
-Yeah.

01:07.047 --> 01:08.464
See, when they wore
those things,

01:08.547 --> 01:11.381
ladies and gentlemen
carried themselves
a certain way.

01:11.464 --> 01:14.381
All the, all the guys
called the ladies "toots."
"Hey, toots."

01:14.464 --> 01:17.381
And the girls would go,
"Poo-poo-be-doop."
♪ Poo-poo-be-doop ♪

01:17.464 --> 01:19.130
-That's how they did it
back in the day.
-What does that even mean?

01:19.214 --> 01:21.047
-Why would they say,
"Poo-poo-be-doop"?
-It's a cute thing.

01:21.130 --> 01:22.381
It gets a rise out of guys
and shit.

01:22.464 --> 01:23.673
♪ Poo-poo-be-doop ♪

01:23.756 --> 01:25.005
That would get a rise
out of you? A woman going,

01:25.089 --> 01:26.339
-"Poo-poo-be-doop"?
-Fuck, yeah.

01:26.422 --> 01:27.714
-If I lived
in the fuckin' '40s...
-Yeah.

01:27.798 --> 01:29.214
...and some girl said,
♪ Poo-poo-be-doop ♪

01:29.297 --> 01:31.923
-I'd know
I'm tappin' that ass.
-(phone beeps)

01:32.005 --> 01:34.756
Ah. A text from Jeff.

01:34.839 --> 01:36.964
He's got--
You know Clive Owen?
He's a new client?

01:37.047 --> 01:38.756
-Yeah, yeah.
-He's in previews now,

01:38.839 --> 01:40.881
and I'm going
to his show tonight.
It's a one-man show.

01:40.964 --> 01:44.089
-I love that motherfucker--
-Yeah. He's like lost at sea
or something.

01:44.172 --> 01:45.756
Oh, Jeff's very excited,
'cause, you know,

01:45.839 --> 01:47.422
he signed Clive Owen,
he's a big deal.

01:47.506 --> 01:48.881
-Big fuckin' deal, man.
Clive Owen, man.
-(doorbell rings)

01:48.964 --> 01:50.422
-I love that fuckin' dude, man.
-Let me get that.

01:50.506 --> 01:51.673
All right.

01:52.381 --> 01:53.798
(door opens)

01:54.506 --> 01:56.381
Must have been nice.

01:56.464 --> 01:58.172
Tappin' that ass
back in the days.

01:58.255 --> 02:00.172
Fuckin' in black and white.

02:11.089 --> 02:13.506
Hey. Larry.
Got a package for you.

02:16.714 --> 02:18.547
Oh. Thanks.

02:22.964 --> 02:25.172
Have a nice day.

02:26.381 --> 02:28.255
(sighs)

02:31.547 --> 02:34.089
-Hey.
-Leon: Trying to
work me today, man.

02:34.172 --> 02:36.714
I got a package
from discreet shipping.

02:36.798 --> 02:39.089
The fuck could that be?
(laughs)

02:41.673 --> 02:44.464
(Leon laughing)

02:44.547 --> 02:46.464
-Oh, shit.
-An inflatable sex doll.

02:46.547 --> 02:49.214
-Wow.
-Huh? Is this your handiwork?

02:49.297 --> 02:51.214
Nah. That shit is old-school.

02:51.297 --> 02:53.005
That's like
Mary Ann from fuckin'
Gilligan's Island.

02:53.089 --> 02:55.673
Oh. You know who sent this?
Freddy Funkhouser.

02:55.756 --> 02:57.130
It's Marty's half-brother.

02:57.214 --> 02:58.464
-Why would
the motherfucker send you--
-I don't know.

02:58.547 --> 03:00.005
-What is this?
Is this a joke?
-Yeah.

03:00.089 --> 03:01.756
It's an old-school
joke right here, man.

03:01.839 --> 03:04.005
The new ones, they got
one that's sensitive
around the fuckin' neck.

03:04.089 --> 03:06.089
You could put hickeys
on that motherfucker
if you wanted to, man.

03:06.172 --> 03:08.005
-I'm glad they're working on it.
-You should,
it's fucking fabulous.

03:08.089 --> 03:10.964
Hey, do me a favor.
Get rid of this, okay?
And this place--

03:11.047 --> 03:13.172
-What's happened to this place?
-Fuckin' mess, man.

03:13.255 --> 03:14.589
-It's a mess.
-Yeah.

03:14.673 --> 03:17.047
-So just throw this
box out, will ya?
-Ha-ha-ha.

03:17.130 --> 03:18.673
-Will you take care
of that? Huh?
-I got it, man.

03:18.756 --> 03:20.547
-I'll get rid
of this shit for you.
-Thank you.

03:21.464 --> 03:24.214
-So, bathroom's
gonna be over there.
-Yeah. Yep.

03:24.297 --> 03:26.089
-Two urinals.
-Mm-hmm.

03:26.172 --> 03:28.172
I got a lot of ideas
for the urinals.

03:28.255 --> 03:31.506
-You wanna redesign a urinal?
-Yeah. Exactly.

03:31.589 --> 03:35.214
The splashing, the puddles--
that has to be eliminated.

03:35.297 --> 03:36.547
-It's a big issue. Yeah.
-Okay.

03:36.631 --> 03:37.923
What I wanted, I want

03:38.005 --> 03:40.172
-two planks
about this wide.
-Okay.

03:40.255 --> 03:42.798
-Going up, you walk up
to the urinal. I'm walking--
-You want it elevated?

03:42.881 --> 03:45.881
-Elevated planks. Your feet
never touch the ground.
-Right.

03:45.964 --> 03:48.839
-Why?
-That's where
the puddles are.

03:48.923 --> 03:50.881
What if they get urine
on the planks?

03:50.964 --> 03:52.756
Well, that can't happen,

03:52.839 --> 03:54.673
because of this.

03:55.339 --> 03:57.381
That, my friend,
is the pee cube.

03:57.464 --> 03:58.923
-The pee cube?
-Yes.

03:59.005 --> 04:02.297
You pee into the cube,
and there's a chute
that goes down.

04:02.381 --> 04:04.589
Maybe we can get a--
create a vacuum
or something,

04:04.673 --> 04:06.214
sucking the urine
down the chute.

04:06.297 --> 04:08.005
-And then, so,
two of these?
-Yeah.

04:08.089 --> 04:10.297
And then on the other side,
I'll put two or three
floor toilets. Correct?

04:10.381 --> 04:12.631
No, there's no toilets.

04:12.714 --> 04:14.172
There's no defecation here.

04:14.255 --> 04:17.297
If a customer comes in here
and does want to defecate...

04:17.381 --> 04:19.756
-Mm.
-...what do you
expect them to do?

04:19.839 --> 04:22.089
-I expect them to
go someplace else.
-Okay. So...

04:22.172 --> 04:24.005
Look, there's no defecation
in the building.

04:24.089 --> 04:25.381
You want me to make it
so they can't?

04:25.464 --> 04:26.756
Could you do that?

04:26.839 --> 04:28.923
I could put a sensor on there
that detects a penis.

04:29.005 --> 04:31.964
-A little, um, penis
sensor, if you will.
-Really?

04:32.047 --> 04:33.839
We can make it voice-activated.
It'll go...

04:33.923 --> 04:35.798
Doot-doot-doot.
"Penis detected." Woot.

04:35.881 --> 04:38.005
The door will open up,
and then once the man is done,

04:38.089 --> 04:39.923
doot-doot-doot. Woot.
Slide down.

04:40.005 --> 04:41.839
-That's terrific.
-Hello, Larry.

04:41.923 --> 04:44.297
I'd like to introduce you
to Mr. Ted Danson.

04:44.381 --> 04:46.464
Mr. Danson has just become

04:46.547 --> 04:49.005
the newest financial backer

04:49.089 --> 04:51.339
of Mocha Joe's cafe.

04:51.422 --> 04:52.881
Well...

04:54.422 --> 04:57.172
You think you're up for
this fight, General Lee?

04:58.172 --> 04:59.631
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

04:59.714 --> 05:03.464
Yeah. I'm gonna
look forward to spiting
your spite store.

05:03.547 --> 05:06.631
-You sure you wanna get into it?
-Yeah. Oh, yeah.
I'm highly motivated.

05:06.714 --> 05:09.297
(with Southern accent):
Well, I do declare.
As I recall,

05:09.381 --> 05:11.964
General Lee was a loser.

05:12.047 --> 05:14.964
-Let's go, Mr. Danson.
I think we've said enough.
-Yeah.

05:15.047 --> 05:17.881
(indistinct chatter)

05:17.964 --> 05:20.381
Another week without wind.

05:20.881 --> 05:24.589
Before this journey,
my life was bereft
of the wind of purpose.

05:24.673 --> 05:26.881
Now I have the purpose,
but without the wind.

05:26.964 --> 05:30.089
Now there are no days,
no nights.

05:30.172 --> 05:32.381
-Just the relentless
slap of the wave.
-(quietly): Wow.

05:32.464 --> 05:35.339
-He's great. Really great.
-Clive Owen:
I am completely alone.

05:36.130 --> 05:39.589
-Even my parrot
Lorita has perished.
-(woman sobbing)

05:39.673 --> 05:41.839
(sobbing)

05:41.923 --> 05:45.172
I give my last will
and testament to the waves,

05:45.255 --> 05:47.172
-who refuse to weep with me.
-(sobbing)

05:47.255 --> 05:50.297
My final epitaph written
in the froth and the foam.

05:50.381 --> 05:54.464
-(whispers): People
are just sobbing.
-Goodbye, Kon Tiki.

05:54.547 --> 05:57.506
Larry: Really.
Clive was so good.
I really loved the show.

05:57.589 --> 05:59.506
I really did. I'm--
I'm not just saying that.

05:59.589 --> 06:01.506
-No, I can tell.
I loved it, too.
-Yeah.

06:01.589 --> 06:03.714
It was a great show.
People were sobbing.

06:03.798 --> 06:05.964
To a dramatic actor,
hearing sobs must be the same

06:06.047 --> 06:08.005
as a comedian
hearing big laughs, right?

06:08.089 --> 06:09.506
-I would think so.
-Do me a favor?

06:09.589 --> 06:11.172
-Yeah?
-Tell him, tell him
how much I liked it?

06:11.255 --> 06:12.756
I got a better idea.

06:12.839 --> 06:14.297
You tell him
how much you liked it.

06:14.381 --> 06:16.506
Oh, no, no.
Don't do that. Don't--
You're doing that?

06:16.589 --> 06:18.547
-Ringing. Ringing.
-I can't believe
you're doing this.

06:18.631 --> 06:20.005
-(phone rings)
-What are you doing?

06:20.089 --> 06:21.589
Clive (on voicemail):
Hey, it's Clive here.

06:21.673 --> 06:23.589
-Um, please leave
a message. Thanks.
-(voicemail beeps)

06:23.673 --> 06:27.547
Oh, hey, Clive.
This is, uh, Larry David,
a good friend of Jeff.

06:27.631 --> 06:30.339
Uh, I saw the show last night.

06:30.422 --> 06:32.839
I really enjoyed it.
Uh, good job.

06:32.923 --> 06:35.964
-There you go.
I appreciate that.
-Susie: Matilda?

06:36.047 --> 06:38.130
-Miss Susie.
-Susie: Oh!

06:38.214 --> 06:39.923
-You ironed the napkins!
-Yes.

06:40.005 --> 06:42.631
Jesus fucking Christ,
you're amazing!

06:42.714 --> 06:45.381
And I folded your laundry
by color and style.

06:45.464 --> 06:47.172
And today I'm gonna clean
your makeup brushes.

06:47.255 --> 06:49.172
You're gonna clean
my makeup brushes.

06:49.255 --> 06:50.673
Oh, my God.

06:50.756 --> 06:52.506
You're a fucking saint!

06:52.589 --> 06:54.714
I love this girl.
She's amazing.

06:54.798 --> 06:56.589
I'm telling you,
she takes initiative.

06:56.673 --> 06:59.089
I've never had
a housekeeper
that does this.

06:59.172 --> 07:01.130
I am so completely jealous.

07:01.214 --> 07:04.422
-Why?
-My house is a, you know,
I got-- my house is a mess.

07:04.506 --> 07:07.964
Lar, she just told me
this morning

07:08.047 --> 07:09.964
her Tuesday-Thursday
moved out of town.

07:10.047 --> 07:11.964
She's got an opening
she's trying to fill.

07:12.047 --> 07:13.506
-Really?
-Yeah.

07:13.589 --> 07:16.214
-I'll... I'll take it.
-Susie: You'll be very happy.

07:16.297 --> 07:18.798
-But Monday-Wednesday is mine.
-Yeah, yeah. Of course.

07:18.881 --> 07:20.756
All right. She's yours.
I'm gonna go tell her.

07:20.839 --> 07:23.464
But keep Leon
away from her, please.

07:24.339 --> 07:26.339
That I can't guarantee.

07:26.422 --> 07:29.214
A sex doll? I, I--
What are you thinking about?

07:29.297 --> 07:31.255
-I don't
even understand.
-Why?

07:31.339 --> 07:33.255
Why'd you send a doll
like that to my house?

07:33.339 --> 07:36.089
Hey, Freddy!
Where's my section?

07:36.172 --> 07:38.047
Uncle Moke,
just look around.
You'll find it.

07:38.130 --> 07:40.756
Take a look around.
You'll find it.
You like it?

07:40.839 --> 07:43.297
-A gag gift? You're sending me--
-No, no, no. It's a real gift.

07:43.381 --> 07:45.422
-You've never had one?
-You think I'm gonna
fuck that doll?

07:45.506 --> 07:47.464
-Yeah, yeah. Have you ever
played around with 'em?
-No!

07:47.547 --> 07:48.881
You cuddle it,
whatever your journey is.

07:48.964 --> 07:50.839
-No, no. I don't know.
-No, no. That's not my journey.

07:50.923 --> 07:53.464
-I don't know what it is.
-I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna fuck a doll.

07:53.547 --> 07:55.214
-You have one of these?
-Couple of 'em.

07:55.297 --> 07:57.839
-You've got a couple.
-I love it. I'm comfortable.
I'm healthy.

07:57.923 --> 08:00.255
That's where we're at.
No disease.

08:00.339 --> 08:02.589
It feels good.
It's something
you're connecting to.

08:02.673 --> 08:04.047
You got a good
imagination,
same thing.

08:04.130 --> 08:05.589
The doll is whatever
you want it to be.

08:05.673 --> 08:07.130
Maybe you should
try necrophilia.

08:07.214 --> 08:08.673
Now you're picking
different hang-ups.

08:08.756 --> 08:10.214
I'm not saying that.
I'm saying the doll's--

08:10.297 --> 08:11.798
You're open
to so many things.

08:11.881 --> 08:13.464
-I'm open to something
that feels good.
-Fuck a dead woman.

08:13.547 --> 08:16.089
Here's the good news:
If I want to fuck
a dead woman,

08:16.172 --> 08:19.297
I'll fuck the doll. Okay?
And that way, I don't have
to fuck a dead woman.

08:19.381 --> 08:22.130
-You hear from Marty?
-He's in China.
He's doing great.

08:22.214 --> 08:23.798
He met a girl,
a real girl, no doll.

08:23.881 --> 08:26.964
-Chinese girl?
-Yeah. He sent me
a nice e-mail. He's lovin' it.

08:27.047 --> 08:29.047
-Excuse me. No browsing.
-I'm not browsing.

08:29.130 --> 08:31.339
-Put the magazine away
or buy it, please.
-I'm not browsing.

08:31.422 --> 08:33.422
-Leave me alone.
-You have been here
for at least ten minutes.

08:33.506 --> 08:35.172
No problem.
He's gonna buy it.
I'm a buyer.

08:35.255 --> 08:37.464
-Oh, this is your father?
-Yeah, he's just looking.
I'm a buyer.

08:37.547 --> 08:38.589
Moke.

08:39.214 --> 08:41.506
-You buying this?
Of course I'm gonna buy it.
-Moke.

08:41.589 --> 08:44.464
All the free porn
on the Internet.
Why stick with magazines?

08:44.964 --> 08:47.214
-It's on the Internet?
-Yeah. Do you have a computer?

08:47.297 --> 08:49.172
Yeah. My kids
bought me a computer,
but I don't use it.

08:49.255 --> 08:51.839
Well, Moke,
everything here

08:51.923 --> 08:53.714
is a click away
on the Internet.

08:53.798 --> 08:56.047
Come on.
Don't kid me.

08:56.130 --> 08:57.673
-I'm not kidding you, Moke.
-You sure?

08:57.756 --> 08:59.547
-Moke, I am not kidding.
-Just don't kid me.

08:59.631 --> 09:01.881
-Check it out.
-Maybe I will.

09:04.798 --> 09:06.547
Thanks a lot.

09:09.464 --> 09:12.756
Now, Carol, what exactly
do you see in this man?

09:12.839 --> 09:14.631
-What kind of
question is that?
-(chuckles)

09:14.714 --> 09:17.047
-I think it's a good question.
-I think behind those...

09:17.130 --> 09:20.714
-dark clothes lies a...
-Very pretentious man?

09:20.798 --> 09:22.547
What's wrong
with dark clothes?
I always wear black.

09:22.631 --> 09:24.631
He thinks people are aware
that he dresses in black.

09:24.714 --> 09:26.047
He thinks he's like Johnny Cash.

09:26.130 --> 09:27.589
-Why do you
always wear black?
-Larry: Yeah. Why?

09:27.673 --> 09:29.631
I've been a comic 48 years,
and people expect me to be--

09:29.714 --> 09:31.214
Nobody gives a fuck.

09:31.297 --> 09:33.381
Is anyone else cold?
Are you cold?

09:33.464 --> 09:34.714
-Richard: A little chilly.
-I'm cold suddenly.

09:34.798 --> 09:36.673
I wish I'd brought
a cardigan or something.

09:36.756 --> 09:39.714
-We can turn on the heat lamp.
-Oh, yeah. That would be great.

09:39.798 --> 09:41.547
Um, excuse me.

09:41.631 --> 09:43.506
Do you have any problem
if we turn on the heat lamp?

09:43.589 --> 09:45.130
-She's very cold.
-Man: We're hot over here.

09:45.214 --> 09:46.923
-We're fine. It's okay.
-We're good here.
It feels great.

09:47.005 --> 09:48.631
-You know, the heat lamp's
for both tables.
-Well, we have seven.

09:48.714 --> 09:50.631
Well, but we have
seven people here
and we're fine.

09:50.714 --> 09:52.214
-You have three people there.
-Man: You're outvoted.

09:52.297 --> 09:54.214
Yeah, I, I, I know,
but she's cold,

09:54.297 --> 09:56.005
and it's worse to be cold,
than hot.

09:56.089 --> 09:58.255
No, it's actually worse
to be hot than cold.

09:58.339 --> 10:01.255
-How do you figure?
-Because when you're cold,
you can put more things on.

10:01.339 --> 10:03.130
When you're hot,
you can only take
so much off.

10:03.214 --> 10:06.047
Okay, well, that's a good point,
if there are more things
to put on.

10:06.130 --> 10:07.673
But there aren't more things
to put on.

10:07.756 --> 10:10.255
-Here. Have her wear that.
-Oh, that's funny, asshole.

10:10.339 --> 10:12.297
Look, we're not snowmen.
We need some heat.

10:12.381 --> 10:14.589
Hey. I just thought
of something.

10:14.673 --> 10:16.798
-My mother's
old mink stole.
-Oh.

10:16.881 --> 10:19.047
I'm getting it dry-cleaned.
It's in my car.
Let me go get it.

10:19.130 --> 10:21.881
-Thank you.
No, that would be so nice.
-Yeah.

10:21.964 --> 10:23.714
I really appreciate that, Larry.

10:23.798 --> 10:25.255
-Oh, sure.
-Richard: Thank you, Larry.

10:25.339 --> 10:26.798
-Carol: Thank you, Larry.
-Wait till you see this thing.

10:26.881 --> 10:28.714
-It's a beauty.
-Thanks, Larry.

10:28.798 --> 10:31.506
-I mean, what a,
what a bunch of douche bags.
-Oh, there he goes. Wow.

10:31.589 --> 10:33.547
-Is he going to get warm?
-Larry: My God.

10:34.547 --> 10:36.923
-There we go.
Look at this.
-Aw.

10:37.005 --> 10:39.839
-Richard: Look, how beautiful.
-Huh? Do you like that?

10:39.923 --> 10:41.297
-Thank you.
-Richard: Beauty on beauty.

10:41.381 --> 10:43.464
-Larry: Real mink.
Real mink.
-So sweet of you.

10:43.547 --> 10:46.005
You know what?
Actually, uh,

10:46.089 --> 10:47.589
this reminds me of

10:47.673 --> 10:50.047
a stole my mother had
when I was a little girl.

10:50.130 --> 10:51.381
-Richard: Wow. No kidding.
-Yeah.

10:51.464 --> 10:54.214
She used to wrap me up
in it to keep me warm.

10:54.798 --> 10:56.881
Yeah. And I remember
when I was 12,

10:56.964 --> 10:59.714
my dad and mom
took me to see
La Cage aux Folles.

10:59.798 --> 11:01.130
-Oh, La Cage aux Folles.
-You remember that?

11:01.214 --> 11:02.798
Yeah, I remember.
That was on Broadway, yeah.

11:02.881 --> 11:04.881
It was such a great night.
And then when we came out,

11:04.964 --> 11:06.255
we, uh...

11:06.339 --> 11:08.464
yeah, we couldn't get a cab,
because...

11:08.547 --> 11:12.130
well, they were all taken,
so we decided to take
the subway.

11:12.214 --> 11:13.631
But, um...

11:13.714 --> 11:15.339
on the platform, my, uh,

11:15.422 --> 11:17.047
my mom and dad
got in a really big fight,

11:17.130 --> 11:20.172
and they started
pushing each other,
and... (sighs)

11:20.255 --> 11:21.923
and the stole, it...

11:22.756 --> 11:24.464
it landed on the tracks.

11:25.547 --> 11:26.714
Oh, my God.

11:26.798 --> 11:29.130
Carol: I saw the lights
of the train, and I...

11:29.214 --> 11:31.923
I heard the...
the honk of the train,

11:32.005 --> 11:34.005
and my mom, she...

11:34.089 --> 11:36.673
she jumped onto the tracks,
just really quickly,

11:36.756 --> 11:38.798
just to grab the stole,
because... (sobs)

11:38.881 --> 11:40.839
it meant so much to her.

11:40.923 --> 11:42.714
And then...

11:42.798 --> 11:45.631
she tried to get back up,
she tried to--

11:45.714 --> 11:47.839
-to scratch her way
back up, but...
-Oh, come on.

11:47.923 --> 11:50.172
-Oh, my God.
What a story.
-(Carol sobbing)

11:50.255 --> 11:52.881
Oh, my God.
The horn. I just--

11:52.964 --> 11:55.005
(sobbing):
The sound of the horn.

11:55.089 --> 11:57.631
-Oh, baby. I'm, oh...
-Carol: I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11:57.714 --> 11:59.714
-I'm sorry!
-Geez. I'm so sorry.

11:59.798 --> 12:03.631
(sobbing):
I just have so little
to remember her by.

12:04.756 --> 12:08.214
You know what, if it means
that much to you, I...

12:08.297 --> 12:10.047
I, I want you to have it.

12:10.130 --> 12:13.381
-I want you to have it.
I want you to keep it.
-What?

12:13.464 --> 12:15.673
-Really?
-I'm positive. Carol, please.

12:15.756 --> 12:17.255
-Keep the stole.
-No, you take it.

12:17.339 --> 12:18.798
No, I'm giving it to you.

12:18.881 --> 12:21.047
-Really?
-She said she has
so little to remember her by.

12:21.130 --> 12:24.881
-Keep the stole.
-Oh, that's so--
That's really nice.

12:24.964 --> 12:27.214
-Thank you.
-Of course. If my mother
were at the table,

12:27.297 --> 12:29.339
my mother would give
it to you, you know.

12:29.422 --> 12:31.798
-No, she wouldn't,
but, you know.
-Thank you. (laughs)

12:31.881 --> 12:34.422
-(phone buzzing)
-Oh, I'm buzzing.

12:35.714 --> 12:38.631
Oh, guys, I gotta go to work.
I gotta go.

12:38.714 --> 12:41.089
-Richard: Oh, no.
-I didn't even get
to have lunch.

12:41.172 --> 12:43.172
-Bye, baby.
-Take care, baby.

12:43.255 --> 12:45.130
-Thank you.
-Yeah, you're welcome.

12:45.214 --> 12:46.798
-Bye, you guys.
-Enjoy that stole.

12:46.881 --> 12:48.589
Bye-bye. I'll speak
to you later.

12:48.673 --> 12:50.130
Oh, my God.

12:50.214 --> 12:52.631
The poor thing.
Imagine being
a 12-year-old girl,

12:52.714 --> 12:55.506
seeing your mother
get hit by a train,

12:55.589 --> 12:57.130
going after
a mink stole, ugh!

12:57.214 --> 12:59.381
Wouldn't you wake up
every morning, boom--

12:59.464 --> 13:01.089
the horns,
do you think of the horns?

13:01.172 --> 13:02.798
I mean, how do you even
go to work after that?

13:02.881 --> 13:04.964
What, what--
What does she--
What does she do?

13:05.047 --> 13:07.464
She's a professional crier.

13:07.547 --> 13:10.130
What? A what?

13:10.214 --> 13:11.964
She's a professional crier.

13:12.047 --> 13:14.381
She's hired to cry
at weddings,

13:14.464 --> 13:17.589
and funerals,
or sometimes TV shows.

13:17.673 --> 13:19.464
You know,
if there's a sad moment,

13:19.547 --> 13:21.798
she's in the background
sobbing.

13:21.881 --> 13:23.214
Oh, my God.

13:23.297 --> 13:25.172
What's wrong with you?
What are you worried about?

13:25.255 --> 13:27.631
I'm worried I just got fleeced
for a mink stole.

13:27.714 --> 13:29.714
-You piece of shit.
How dare you?
-Piece of shit?

13:29.798 --> 13:32.714
-How dare you?
-Are you kidding?
I mean, think about it.

13:32.798 --> 13:34.547
You can hear that,
and say something like that?

13:34.631 --> 13:36.089
Hey, let me ask you something.

13:36.172 --> 13:38.589
Have you guys ever had
a disagreement of any kind,

13:38.673 --> 13:40.631
where perhaps
she started crying?

13:40.714 --> 13:42.214
-Yeah, a few times--
-What?

13:42.297 --> 13:44.089
-What was the disagreement?
-You know, dinner.

13:44.172 --> 13:46.214
She wanted Chinese,
I wanted Italian.

13:46.297 --> 13:48.339
-So she wept openly and--
-Oh.

13:48.422 --> 13:50.631
Yeah, and you went down--
and you had Chinese food.

13:50.714 --> 13:53.214
-Chinese, we did.
-Oh, my God. Come on!

13:53.297 --> 13:55.005
-This is unbelievable!
-Don't Perry Mason her.

13:55.089 --> 13:58.631
She fucking conned me
out of that mink stole.
This is incredible!

13:58.714 --> 14:00.881
-I don't have to buy
your defense on this.
-You saw it!

14:00.964 --> 14:03.089
You witnessed it.
She's a con crier.

14:03.172 --> 14:06.089
-So what do you want me to do?
-I can't believe
I fell for that story.

14:06.172 --> 14:09.255
(whimpering):
Oh... the stole was
on the subway!

14:09.339 --> 14:11.756
And the horn, the horn!
(whimpering)

14:11.839 --> 14:14.089
I want that stole back, okay?

14:17.214 --> 14:19.297
♪ ♪

14:36.923 --> 14:39.881
-Mr. Larry! Hey!
-Oh! Hey!

14:39.964 --> 14:42.005
I clean all the windows
and all the mantles.

14:42.089 --> 14:43.297
-Oh.
-They were so dirty.

14:43.381 --> 14:45.047
-And I polished
all the doorknobs.
-Good.

14:45.130 --> 14:46.798
-Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

14:46.881 --> 14:48.381
-You're welcome.
-Thank you.

14:48.464 --> 14:50.214
What, what is this,
Mr. Larry?

14:50.297 --> 14:52.255
Oh. It's a...

14:52.339 --> 14:53.881
That's a doll.

14:53.964 --> 14:56.881
-What kind doll?
-Eh, you know,
I collect them.

14:56.964 --> 14:59.673
They're like, uh,
big teddy bears. Yeah.

14:59.756 --> 15:01.255
You collect big plastic dolls?

15:01.339 --> 15:03.798
Yes, yes. I do.
They, um...

15:04.798 --> 15:06.547
They normally come with clothes.

15:06.631 --> 15:08.464
-Yeah, she's naked.
-Yeah, it's naked, yeah.

15:08.547 --> 15:10.756
They forgot to send
the clothes for some reason.
I don't know why.

15:10.839 --> 15:13.547
You know, they come with
a lot of different outfits.

15:13.631 --> 15:15.339
-Oh, like the,
this American Girl.
-Yes!

15:15.422 --> 15:17.422
Like the American Girl!
Right, right.

15:17.506 --> 15:19.047
Yeah, they have
a nurse's outfit,

15:19.130 --> 15:22.047
they have a flight attendant,
a cheerleader.

15:22.130 --> 15:24.923
They even have,
um, a, a maid!

15:25.005 --> 15:26.547
Oh! So, you know what?

15:26.631 --> 15:28.339
Let me clean it,
'cause it's a little bit dirty.

15:28.422 --> 15:30.464
Oh, no. You know,
you don't, no. I...

15:30.547 --> 15:31.631
That's, uh...
you know,

15:31.714 --> 15:33.589
it's very delicate,
very delicate.

15:33.673 --> 15:36.089
Anyway, I just want you to know,
you're doing a fantastic job.

15:36.172 --> 15:38.089
Thank you.
I wanted to ask you,

15:38.172 --> 15:40.047
uh, I need to switch my days.

15:40.130 --> 15:41.798
-Mm-hmm.
-And I would like
to work Mondays

15:41.881 --> 15:43.339
and Wednesdays for you.

15:43.422 --> 15:45.631
No, those are Susie's days.

15:45.714 --> 15:48.047
Oh, no. I'm not gonna be
working with Miss Susie
anymore.

15:48.130 --> 15:50.172
-What? What do you,
what do you mean?
-Her mouth.

15:50.255 --> 15:52.422
She's like "F" this,
"F" that. She's so vulgar.

15:52.506 --> 15:54.422
Like, F-bomb for everything.

15:54.506 --> 15:56.756
The thing is, I have
kind of an agreement with her.

15:56.839 --> 15:58.589
-I can't breach her.
-Well,

15:58.673 --> 16:00.339
all I can say is that
I have another family

16:00.422 --> 16:02.798
that I need to work with on
Tuesdays and Thursdays, so--

16:02.881 --> 16:05.089
-You're gonna leave Susie,
regardless?
-Yeah, regardless.

16:05.172 --> 16:06.881
I am done with Miss Susie.

16:08.005 --> 16:09.214
Okay.

16:09.297 --> 16:11.422
-Yes? Okay.
-Ah.

16:11.506 --> 16:14.589
-See you next Monday.
I'm gonna do the refrigerator.
-Bye.

16:14.673 --> 16:16.881
Hey, do anchovies
only go on pizza?

16:16.964 --> 16:18.422
-Or can you
eat 'em loose?
-Hey.

16:18.506 --> 16:20.089
Come here, come here.
You blew it up?

16:20.172 --> 16:21.798
-Yeah, I blew the shit up.
-You're supposed
to get rid of it.

16:21.881 --> 16:23.756
-Who, Sherry?
-Oh, Sherry?
You gave it a name?

16:23.839 --> 16:26.339
Yeah, I mean,
I got her out of the box.
Give her a little air and shit.

16:26.422 --> 16:28.464
-Oh, so you were,
you were curious.
-Fuck, yeah.

16:28.547 --> 16:29.964
I wanna see what the fuck
she was working with.

16:30.047 --> 16:32.297
Yeah. And, uh...

16:32.381 --> 16:35.297
You didn't try and get
a little friendly with her,
did you?

16:35.381 --> 16:36.839
What the fuck
you trying to say?

16:36.923 --> 16:38.673
-Did you get a little
friendly with her?
-I'm insulted.

16:38.756 --> 16:39.964
-That you would say
some shit like that to me.
-Leon, did you get

16:40.047 --> 16:41.255
a little friendly
with her, Leon?

16:41.339 --> 16:42.422
-Nah. Not at all.
-Huh?

16:42.506 --> 16:43.631
Why do you always
look at me like this?

16:43.714 --> 16:45.214
I'm trying to look
into your fuckin' brain.

16:45.297 --> 16:47.422
-What is this? Yeah. Uh-huh.
-I'm lookin' into you. Yeah.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.339
You look down into
a motherfucker's soul.

16:49.422 --> 16:50.798
You think you're better
than me, Leon Black?

16:50.881 --> 16:52.381
-I know my character.
-Yeah?

16:52.464 --> 16:53.589
And when you accuse me

16:53.673 --> 16:55.130
of tappin'
some ass like that...

16:55.214 --> 16:57.464
I wouldn't put it past you,
let's just say that.

16:57.547 --> 16:58.756
(doorbell chimes)

16:58.839 --> 17:00.798
Get rid of
that fucking thing.

17:02.172 --> 17:03.923
Be cool, Sherry.

17:07.089 --> 17:08.798
-Hey.
-How are you?

17:08.881 --> 17:11.673
-Good. Good.
-Well, guess what, LD?

17:11.756 --> 17:14.172
-What?
-I did what you
wanted me to do.

17:14.255 --> 17:16.464
-And it didn't work out.
-Oh.

17:16.547 --> 17:18.005
And Carol broke up with me.

17:18.089 --> 17:21.047
-Really?
-I went over there,
I asked for your mink back,

17:21.130 --> 17:22.381
she wept openly,

17:22.464 --> 17:23.964
-and kicked me out of her life.
-Oh, she wept openly.

17:24.047 --> 17:25.422
That's how she got the mink
in the first place.

17:25.506 --> 17:27.130
Yeah, well, you ruined
another woman for me.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.381
I could've had a baby
with this woman and maybe
become a father.

17:29.464 --> 17:31.923
A baby?
You're 200 years old.
You're gonna have a baby?

17:32.005 --> 17:33.798
Do me a favor.
Just stay out of my affairs.

17:33.881 --> 17:36.506
Meanwhile, she still
has the mink, okay?
And I'm gettin' it back.

17:36.589 --> 17:37.881
-No, you're not.
-Yes, I am.

17:37.964 --> 17:39.506
Aah, bullshit.

17:40.255 --> 17:42.255
What the hell is that?

17:42.339 --> 17:44.214
Ah, it's a--
It's a sex doll.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.714
-A sex doll.
-Yeah. Her name's Sherry.

17:46.798 --> 17:48.798
Come on.
I'll introduce you to her.

17:48.881 --> 17:50.339
Susie:
You breached.

17:50.422 --> 17:52.631
You made a solemn
promise, a vow,

17:52.714 --> 17:55.047
and you fucking
breached, asshole.

17:55.130 --> 17:57.589
She was quitting!
She wasn't working for you

17:57.673 --> 17:59.673
on Mondays and Wednesdays,
that was it.

17:59.756 --> 18:02.381
She doesn't wanna work here.
She can't stand you!

18:02.464 --> 18:04.047
-Oh, that's nonsense!
-You're a vulgarian!

18:04.130 --> 18:06.255
You use disgusting language
around her.

18:06.339 --> 18:07.839
She's a strict Catholic girl.

18:07.923 --> 18:10.422
-Okay--
-Hold on a second, here.

18:11.005 --> 18:13.047
She make you biscuits?

18:13.130 --> 18:14.714
-Yeah.
-Ridiculous.

18:14.798 --> 18:16.339
-My God.
-Well, I'm gonna tell you

18:16.422 --> 18:17.547
a little something
what you're gonna do.

18:17.631 --> 18:19.172
When those biscuits are warm,

18:19.255 --> 18:21.547
you're gonna
get out some tin foil,

18:21.631 --> 18:22.839
You're gonna wrap
those babies up,

18:22.923 --> 18:24.381
and you're dropping 'em off
at my office.

18:24.464 --> 18:26.255
And when you drop off
those biscuits,

18:26.339 --> 18:28.923
you're gonna pick up
my laundry and take it
to the Fluff and Fold.

18:29.005 --> 18:32.297
-All right?
-Yeah, I have a movie star
coming over here, Larry.

18:32.381 --> 18:36.422
And look at me,
I'm putting out premade
fuckin' salads from Metzler's.

18:36.506 --> 18:38.172
-Metzler's?
You got Metzler's?
-Susie: Yeah.

18:38.255 --> 18:39.839
-Yeah, I got Metzler's.
-Fanta-- I love Metzler's!

18:39.923 --> 18:41.506
Yeah. And then
I gotta clean up myself.

18:41.589 --> 18:43.589
I don't know how to do
this fucking shit!

18:43.673 --> 18:44.923
-You know what?
-What?

18:45.005 --> 18:46.130
I'll help you clean up.

18:46.214 --> 18:48.422
-Oh, please.
-I'm a fantastic dishwasher.

18:48.506 --> 18:52.547
Did you know that?
I can put my hands in
boiling, scalding water,

18:52.631 --> 18:54.214
and I don't feel anything.

18:54.297 --> 18:56.506
-I don't need gloves!
-Let me see those hands.

18:56.589 --> 18:59.464
-I'm really good.
-You've never washed
a dish in your life.

18:59.547 --> 19:01.255
Well, I haven't washed 'em
in a while, but--

19:01.339 --> 19:03.506
You've watched somebody else
wash and went,

19:03.589 --> 19:06.631
-"Oh, I could be good at that.
I could do that."
-I know I'm a great dishwasher!

19:06.714 --> 19:09.339
-You've never washed!
-Don't tell me I haven't
washed, Jeff!

19:09.422 --> 19:10.881
-You never washed.
-What? I haven't washed?

19:10.964 --> 19:12.714
-And your hands are soft.
-I'll tell you what I'll do.

19:12.798 --> 19:15.422
I'll stick my hands
in the sink right now.
Put it on as hot as you want.

19:15.506 --> 19:17.714
-You don't have special hands!
-I do have special hands!

19:17.798 --> 19:19.714
-You do not have special hands!
-I do. They're very special.

19:19.798 --> 19:22.005
I'll stick 'em under any
hot water you can find, okay?

19:22.089 --> 19:23.714
That's insane!

19:25.714 --> 19:27.214
Listen to me.

19:27.964 --> 19:29.255
Clive's coming over.

19:29.339 --> 19:30.964
-Yeah.
-The voicemail you left.

19:31.047 --> 19:33.381
Clive seems to think
it was insufficient praise.

19:33.464 --> 19:35.756
-(scoffs) What?
Insufficient praise?
-Yeah.

19:35.839 --> 19:37.506
Yeah.
You weren't enthusiastic.

19:37.589 --> 19:40.714
-That's ridiculous.
-No. You gotta--
When you talk to these people,

19:40.798 --> 19:42.714
you gotta almost give
your own performance

19:42.798 --> 19:44.506
-about how much you loved it.
-(doorbell rings)

19:44.589 --> 19:46.339
All right. You know what?
That's him.

19:46.422 --> 19:47.631
Okay?

19:48.214 --> 19:51.130
And by the way,
you're doing the dishes
when we're done.

19:51.214 --> 19:53.339
-Great. Great.
-Yeah, good.
Good for you.

19:53.422 --> 19:56.589
-Susie, I brought you
a movie star.
-Susie: Ah, bravo!

19:56.673 --> 19:59.673
-Clive: Hey!
-Bravo! What a performance.

19:59.756 --> 20:01.839
-Oh, thank you.
-Oh, my God.

20:01.923 --> 20:03.756
-Thanks for inviting me over.
-Movie star.

20:03.839 --> 20:05.506
-Jeff: Larry David.
-Hey.

20:05.589 --> 20:07.214
Susie:
Fantastic.

20:07.297 --> 20:10.297
So, just dig in.
We went to this
new sandwich place.

20:10.381 --> 20:12.297
-What's the name of it, Lar?
-Yeah, Metzler's.

20:12.381 --> 20:14.673
-Metzler's. So, they're
supposed to be fantastic.
-Yeah, it looks great.

20:14.756 --> 20:18.130
In the UK they have, uh,
cucumber sandwiches, right?

20:18.631 --> 20:21.381
-Just, just cucumbers?
-Jeff: No, there's
cream cheese in there.

20:21.464 --> 20:24.005
-Oh, there is?
-Yeah, we have a lot
of different sandwiches.

20:24.089 --> 20:25.506
Larry:
Yeah.

20:25.589 --> 20:27.839
Hey, Clive. Uh, I...

20:27.923 --> 20:30.881
You know, I want
to apologize if, um...

20:30.964 --> 20:34.047
my, my voicemail,
my message

20:34.130 --> 20:36.756
-offended you in any way.
-A little weird, no?

20:36.839 --> 20:39.047
-You know, I'm not good
at voicemails.
-Really?

20:39.130 --> 20:41.047
Yes. When I would leave
a message on, on,

20:41.130 --> 20:43.047
on a woman's phone,
I would always get in trouble

20:43.130 --> 20:45.589
and the relationship
would be over.
I'm just no good at it.

20:45.673 --> 20:47.130
Yeah, but the weird
thing is, you know,

20:47.214 --> 20:49.047
if you go and see a play
and you don't like it,

20:49.130 --> 20:51.047
you kind of don't leave
a message, do you?

20:51.130 --> 20:53.714
-No, but I did like it.
I-- That's, that's--
-Really?

20:53.798 --> 20:56.047
-Yes.
-(flatly): "Hi.
This is Larry David.

20:56.130 --> 21:01.005
I just want to say
I really enjoyed
the show. Good job."

21:01.089 --> 21:04.756
Yeah. Like I said,
I'm not, I'm not good with--
If it was in person,

21:04.839 --> 21:07.255
-I would have been
much more effusive.
-Really?

21:07.339 --> 21:09.214
-Yeah.
-So...

21:10.464 --> 21:13.214
I mean, it's hard to do now.
Bec-- You know, it's--

21:13.297 --> 21:16.589
It's like doing an impression
for somebody. It's hard
to just do it on command.

21:16.673 --> 21:19.756
-You do impressions?
-Yeah. I do a lot.
I can--

21:19.839 --> 21:22.089
I can do Raymond Massey
from, uh, doing Lincoln.

21:22.172 --> 21:24.005
Raymond Massey as Lincoln.
You never see that!

21:24.089 --> 21:27.839
"A house divided against itself
cannot stand."

21:30.089 --> 21:32.422
Well, I was so moved, Clive.

21:32.506 --> 21:34.714
The pathos
of this character.

21:34.798 --> 21:38.756
-The triumph and
the disgrace of his...
-Thank you.

21:38.839 --> 21:42.714
-Thank you.
-Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!
Mmm-mmm!

21:42.798 --> 21:46.130
Oh, my God. Oh.
This is unbelievable!

21:46.214 --> 21:48.756
This Metzler's?
Best, the best.

21:48.839 --> 21:51.631
You see that?
That is genuine praise.

21:51.714 --> 21:53.798
I do a fucking play
for 90 minutes,

21:53.881 --> 21:55.881
digging deep and doing
everything I can,

21:55.964 --> 21:57.464
and you give that
for a sandwich.

21:57.547 --> 21:59.714
So you do do praise,
just not for me.

21:59.798 --> 22:02.964
You know,
that, that kind of thing,
that's not for people.

22:03.047 --> 22:06.631
That's for sandwiches,
a well-struck iron,

22:06.714 --> 22:08.506
-a good golf shot.
-Do you know what it takes?

22:08.589 --> 22:11.631
Stand up there for 90 minutes,
on your own, a one-man play?

22:11.714 --> 22:14.798
-Mm.
-A serious subject like that.
Do you know what it costs?

22:14.881 --> 22:16.714
Must be quite grueling.

22:16.798 --> 22:19.047
One wonders why
somebody would do it.

22:20.714 --> 22:21.839
Is he for real?

22:21.923 --> 22:24.673
No, I'm just saying.
It seems...

a little crazy.

22:26.422 --> 22:28.506
That's what you thought
when you came to see the play?

22:28.589 --> 22:30.631
You thought it's crazy
that someone would do this.

There, there, there it is.

25:16.381 --> 25:18.005
-(Carol sobbing)
-See?

25:18.089 --> 25:19.923
-That's very difficult.
-I lost my mom!

25:20.005 --> 25:21.547
No, you're very good at this.

25:21.631 --> 25:23.422
-If in fact you're making--
-(sobbing): I'm sorry.

25:23.506 --> 25:25.673
-Can't quite--
-Larry, please.

25:25.756 --> 25:27.255
-Larry, get out!
-Oh, oh!

25:35.673 --> 25:37.964
-Larry! Larry!
-(honks)

25:38.047 --> 25:40.422
-Hey, Freddy!
-I was just about to call you.

25:40.506 --> 25:41.964
-Really?
-You created a real problem

25:42.047 --> 25:43.547
with Uncle Moke
with the Internet porn.

25:43.631 --> 25:45.589
Ah, you know, it's,
it's better than,

25:45.673 --> 25:47.339
than paying money
for those magazines.

25:47.422 --> 25:49.255
No, it's all day.
It's a problem.
It's all he does.

25:49.339 --> 25:51.255
And he is paying.
He's doing the chat rooms now.

25:51.339 --> 25:54.381
I'm so sorry. I don't know.
I was just trying to save
the guy some money.

25:54.464 --> 25:56.214
It's addiction.
You gotta do something.

25:56.297 --> 25:58.631
-Do something?
What can I do?
-Whatever it is,

25:58.714 --> 26:00.506
you kind of started it off.
I think you should step in.

26:00.589 --> 26:02.714
-All right, I'll think about it.
-No, don't think about.
Do whatever it is.

26:02.798 --> 26:04.547
I gotta think about it.
I don't know what to do.
I gotta, you know,

26:04.631 --> 26:06.089
-I gotta think about it.
-Okay, that's good.

26:06.172 --> 26:07.422
Hey, did you hit
the doll up yet?

26:07.506 --> 26:10.172
-N-No.
-Take a shot at the doll.

26:12.964 --> 26:15.047
Plumber:
And...

26:15.130 --> 26:18.047
voilà, the pee cube.

26:18.464 --> 26:20.214
-I like it.
-You sure do.

26:20.297 --> 26:21.923
-Yeah.
-Take her for a spin.

26:22.005 --> 26:24.214
-Sure.
-Get on in there, huh?

26:24.297 --> 26:26.381
-There you go.
Look at that.
-Mm-hmm.

26:26.464 --> 26:28.255
-How does that feel?
-Feels pretty good.

26:28.339 --> 26:30.172
Shit.
Got the prototype done,
huh?

26:30.255 --> 26:31.798
-Yeah, you wanna
give it a try?
-Nah, fuck that, man.

26:31.881 --> 26:33.422
That shit ain't
deep enough.

26:33.506 --> 26:34.923
-Plumber: What do you mean?
-What are you talking about?

26:35.005 --> 26:36.422
Any motherfucker that
come up to that shit,

26:36.506 --> 26:38.714
with a little-ass penis,
of course it works for them.

26:38.798 --> 26:41.381
But you got a big-ass johnson,
you gotta stand a little
further back, see,

26:41.464 --> 26:43.130
so your johnson
don't overshoot

26:43.214 --> 26:45.297
and hit the back
of that motherfucker.
I'm not bragging and shit,

26:45.381 --> 26:48.089
but I had a lady
give me a wedgie with
my own goddamn johnson.

26:48.172 --> 26:50.506
Okay. Are we done here?
Uh, can you get--

26:50.589 --> 26:52.547
-Can you get to work
on this thing right away?
-Yeah, of course. Yeah.

26:52.631 --> 26:55.089
-Yeah. I'll get right on it.
-Hey. Let's talk timeline.

26:55.172 --> 26:57.130
-Oh, okay. Yeah.
-Prototype is pretty
fuckin' good, though, man.

26:57.214 --> 26:59.673
-Thanks, man. I appreciate that.
-Leon: You do goddamn good work.

27:00.339 --> 27:01.547
Hmm.

27:02.172 --> 27:03.673
-Hey.
-Hey.

27:03.756 --> 27:04.923
-Hey.
-What are you doing?

27:05.005 --> 27:06.047
What are you doing?

27:06.130 --> 27:07.381
What brings you
to Latte Larry's?

27:07.464 --> 27:10.422
Uh, Clive Owen.
He's a mess.

27:10.506 --> 27:11.923
Ever since you left him
that message

27:12.005 --> 27:13.297
and the other day
at the house...

27:13.381 --> 27:15.464
-What, at lunch?
-...he's lost all confidence.

27:15.547 --> 27:18.005
His shows are not as good.
It's affecting his performances.

27:18.089 --> 27:21.339
-Really?
-Yeah. People used to weep.
Nobody's weeping.

27:21.422 --> 27:23.255
And we open in two days,

27:23.339 --> 27:26.047
and I'm scared
that the critics
are gonna kill him.

27:26.798 --> 27:28.005
Oh, boy.

27:28.089 --> 27:30.673
I gotta do something,
and I don't know what.

27:31.714 --> 27:33.130
Oh.

27:33.214 --> 27:35.172
-Lewis's girlfriend.
-Yeah?

27:35.255 --> 27:36.464
-Carol.
-Yeah?

27:36.547 --> 27:38.172
She's a professional crier.

27:38.255 --> 27:39.798
-Yeah?
-Hire her for opening night.

27:39.881 --> 27:42.005
Let her sit in the audience,
she'll sob away.

27:42.089 --> 27:43.506
-Really?
-Once she starts sobbing,

27:43.589 --> 27:45.464
everyone else
will start sobbing.
Sobs are contagious.

27:45.547 --> 27:48.130
-You can never have
enough criers. No.
-Abs-- I know. You can't.

27:48.214 --> 27:50.047
What the hell is that?

27:51.214 --> 27:53.464
That, my stout friend,

27:53.547 --> 27:56.422
is a urinal revolution.

27:56.506 --> 27:58.589
Clive:
She's a good ship,
the Kon Tiki.

27:58.673 --> 28:00.756
I named her Kon Tiki

28:00.839 --> 28:03.589
in memory of
the Peruvian sun god.

28:03.673 --> 28:05.005
And here I am,

28:05.089 --> 28:07.798
following in Tiki's footsteps.

28:07.881 --> 28:11.339
My only companion was a parrot

28:11.422 --> 28:14.339
that had snuck aboard.

28:14.422 --> 28:16.089
(laughs softly)

28:16.172 --> 28:19.089
-He's not doing good.
-Clive: ...used to be
a tough school.

28:19.172 --> 28:21.798
-Those first few weeks...
-(yawning)

28:21.881 --> 28:23.923
...in the Humboldt Current.

28:24.005 --> 28:25.714
-Which one is she?
-Clive: Before this journey,

28:25.798 --> 28:27.506
-my life was...
-Larry: Oh, there she is.

28:27.589 --> 28:29.422
She's got
my mother's stole on.

28:29.506 --> 28:31.214
She's wearing
the stole.

28:31.297 --> 28:33.506
Clive:
I have the purpose,
but not the wind.

28:33.589 --> 28:34.839
(yawns)

28:35.589 --> 28:39.464
Now there is no day,
no night,
just the relentless...

28:39.547 --> 28:42.547
Ah. There.
She's gonna start.

28:42.631 --> 28:45.798
I am completely alone.

28:46.631 --> 28:49.714
Even my parrot Lorita
has perished.

28:49.798 --> 28:51.839
(sobbing)

28:55.381 --> 28:58.881
(sobbing continues)

28:58.964 --> 29:00.422
Perished.

29:01.964 --> 29:04.422
(sobbing)

29:04.506 --> 29:06.047
Lorita.

29:06.130 --> 29:07.464
Perished!

29:10.422 --> 29:12.964
Look out.
It's really catching on now.

29:13.047 --> 29:16.798
I give my last will
and testament to the waves

29:16.881 --> 29:18.923
-who refuse to weep with me.
-(women sobbing)

29:19.005 --> 29:23.005
My final epitaph written
in the froth and the foam.

29:23.089 --> 29:26.297
Pity the man, who thought

29:26.381 --> 29:28.673
he could go back in time.

29:31.798 --> 29:33.255
Goodbye, Kon Tiki.

29:33.339 --> 29:35.047
(wails): No!

29:35.881 --> 29:38.506
(women sobbing)

29:43.297 --> 29:45.923
Clive:
From a distance,
could it be?

29:46.005 --> 29:47.923
It's land!

29:48.005 --> 29:51.839
Oh! Praise be, Tiki!

29:54.005 --> 29:56.464
Praise be!

29:56.547 --> 29:59.339
(cheering, whistling)

30:00.381 --> 30:01.798
Yeah! Yeah!

30:01.881 --> 30:03.839
Bravo! Wow!

30:10.506 --> 30:13.297
-Yes! Yes! Yes!
-Yeah.

30:13.381 --> 30:15.923
Thank you.
Worked like a charm.
She did great.

30:21.005 --> 30:23.381
Larry:
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

30:23.464 --> 30:26.464
Hey, Carol. Carol.

30:26.547 --> 30:27.964
Oh, Larry, hi!

30:28.047 --> 30:29.172
-Hi.
-How are you?

30:29.255 --> 30:30.631
Good. So, um...

30:30.714 --> 30:32.798
I just wanted to
congratulate you
on that...

30:32.881 --> 30:34.339
magnificent performance.

30:34.422 --> 30:36.464
Oh. It was a very
emotional play.

30:36.547 --> 30:38.339
-(giggles)
-Yeah, it was really special.

30:38.422 --> 30:40.631
I really got to see you
do your thing.

30:40.714 --> 30:43.172
-Mm-hmm.
-And the more I watched you,

30:43.255 --> 30:45.172
the more I'm convinced

30:45.255 --> 30:48.714
that what you did at the table
at lunch that day

30:48.798 --> 30:50.673
was total bullshit.

30:50.756 --> 30:54.089
-Wow.
-Your mother didn't fall
into the subway tracks.

30:54.172 --> 30:56.547
That's a cock-and-bull story
if I ever heard one.

30:56.631 --> 30:58.214
-Give me the stole back.
-You're just being rude.

30:58.297 --> 31:00.506
-Carol, give me the stole.
-Get-- Larry!

31:00.589 --> 31:02.714
-Hey.
-(Carol yelling)

31:02.798 --> 31:05.005
-Hey, hey, hey.
What's the problem?
-Larry, this is--

31:05.089 --> 31:06.714
-(whimpering)
-What's going on?

31:06.798 --> 31:08.714
Okay. She's
a professional crier,

31:08.798 --> 31:12.255
and she conned her way
into getting that stole off me.

31:12.339 --> 31:15.381
-It's my mother's stole.
-Excuse me. Officer,
he is mocking me.

31:15.464 --> 31:18.339
He gave me this stole.
My mother passed away.

31:18.422 --> 31:20.964
And this stole
reminds me of her.

31:21.047 --> 31:22.589
-And this is all I've got.
-Okay. You see?

31:22.673 --> 31:24.381
-This is the same story.
-This is the only thing I've got

31:24.464 --> 31:26.464
-to remember her by.
-She told me the same story
about,

31:26.547 --> 31:28.339
-about being in a subway.
-(wailing)

31:28.422 --> 31:29.881
But she took that stole from me.

31:29.964 --> 31:31.422
-That's my mother's stole.
-(loud wailing)

31:31.506 --> 31:32.881
She-- I inherited
that stole.

31:32.964 --> 31:35.881
-She gave it to me.
-You can't take it back!

31:35.964 --> 31:37.756
-(Larry chattering)
-(Carol wailing)

31:37.839 --> 31:40.255
-Officer: Stop. Stop it.
Hey. Hey, guy.
-(Larry and Carol shrieking)

31:40.339 --> 31:42.381
-Officer:
Hey, what are you doing?
-I want my stole!

31:42.464 --> 31:44.089
-I want-- Aah!
-Officer: Hey, hey.

31:44.172 --> 31:45.631
Hey, what are you doing?

31:45.714 --> 31:48.130
-Crying?
-No, that's crying.
That's not crying.

31:48.214 --> 31:50.130
-No, she's not!
-I'm crying!

31:50.214 --> 31:51.923
I'm crying, Larry!

31:52.005 --> 31:54.214
-I paid her to cry like this!
-All right, let's walk it off.

31:54.297 --> 31:57.047
-Walk it off? She's a,
she's a bullshit artist!
-Let's take a walk. I know.

31:57.130 --> 32:00.005
-Officer: I know. Come on.
Let's walk it off.
-Thank you, Officer.

32:05.547 --> 32:07.339
Clive:
Excuse me.

32:08.005 --> 32:10.464
-Oh. Hi.
-Hi.

32:10.547 --> 32:13.297
I, uh... I couldn't help
noticing you out there.

32:13.381 --> 32:15.923
You seemed very moved.
It was very inspiring.

32:16.005 --> 32:18.798
Oh, I mean, you inspired me.
Your performance was incredible.

32:18.881 --> 32:21.464
Honestly, you were...
It was amazing.

32:21.547 --> 32:24.130
-Wh-what's your name?
-I'm Carol.

32:24.214 --> 32:25.881
I'm Clive.

32:25.964 --> 32:27.673
I know.

32:29.673 --> 32:30.881
Larry:
Leon!

32:30.964 --> 32:33.464
Leon, where's my jacket?

32:34.547 --> 32:36.047
Leon!

32:41.047 --> 32:42.214
Leon!

32:42.297 --> 32:44.089
Leon! What the hell's going on?

32:44.172 --> 32:45.714
You said you were
going to deflate it.

32:45.798 --> 32:48.464
You know what?
I didn't get around to it.
I'll...

32:48.547 --> 32:50.381
-Slipped my mind.
-Slipped your mind.

32:50.464 --> 32:52.214
-It was there,
then the shit was gone.
-You know what I think?

32:52.297 --> 32:54.506
I think you gave it a name.
You're keeping it
around the house.

32:54.589 --> 32:56.964
You can't get rid of this thing.
You're fuckin' her,
aren't you?

32:57.047 --> 32:58.631
I'm not gonna sit here
and let you do this shit
to me right now.

32:58.714 --> 32:59.923
-Oh, you're not?
-No, I'm not.

33:00.005 --> 33:01.381
Okay.
Well, you know what?

33:01.464 --> 33:03.172
Say goodbye to her,
'cause I'm deflating her
right now.

33:03.255 --> 33:04.798
-Fuck you, Larry.
-Fuck you, Leon.

33:04.881 --> 33:06.047
Fuck you, Larry.

33:06.130 --> 33:07.589
Be good, Sherry.

33:10.130 --> 33:13.381
(air hissing)

33:15.547 --> 33:18.214
(air sputtering)

33:21.839 --> 33:24.422
(rhythmic squeaking)

33:26.255 --> 33:27.881
-Matilda: Mr. Larry!
-(Larry grunting)

33:28.005 --> 33:30.839
-(loud grunting)
-I found your jack--

33:30.923 --> 33:32.964
(air hissing)

33:34.506 --> 33:35.673
Asco!

33:35.756 --> 33:37.297
-No. No. Basta!
-Oh!

33:37.381 --> 33:39.297
-Eres un pervertido.
-No, no, no!

33:39.381 --> 33:41.589
I quit! You're worse
than Miss Susie!

33:41.673 --> 33:43.506
No, I'm just deflating her!

33:43.589 --> 33:45.589
No! Wait! No!

33:45.673 --> 33:47.130
Aah!

33:49.422 --> 33:51.506
Oh, my God!

33:51.589 --> 33:52.964
(air hissing)

33:53.047 --> 33:54.631
Larry.

33:55.547 --> 33:56.839
Oh, God.

33:56.923 --> 33:59.506
-(air squeaking)
-Cheryl: God.

33:59.589 --> 34:02.798
(squeaking)

34:03.506 --> 34:05.839
-Susie: Ha-ha.
-So, here's to the play.

34:05.923 --> 34:07.297
-Jeff: Yes!
-Kon Tiki.

34:07.381 --> 34:09.506
-Cheers. Cheers.
-Susie: Fantastic.

34:09.589 --> 34:11.047
-Kon Tiki.
-Cheers.

34:11.130 --> 34:12.673
Jeff:
God, that was just...

34:12.756 --> 34:14.214
Hey, do me a favor.

34:14.297 --> 34:15.839
Just the one line
from the review.

34:15.923 --> 34:18.172
-Clive: Oh, no.
-Carol: Read it! Yes!

34:18.255 --> 34:20.130

"Clive Owen's portrayal
of Thor Heyerdahl

34:28.005 --> 34:31.047
"is as nuanced, varied,
and moving

34:31.130 --> 34:33.005
as the ocean he traversed."

34:33.089 --> 34:34.547
-Oh.
-Fuck, yes!

34:34.631 --> 34:36.047

Thank you for
making it all happen.

-I've had the best time.

Mm. Oh, sweetie, actually, no.
I have to go to work.

-Oh, my God.

34:58.673 --> 35:00.255
I've been so consumed,

35:00.339 --> 35:01.631
I haven't even asked you
what you do.

35:01.714 --> 35:03.964
I'm a professional crier.

35:04.047 --> 35:05.839
Bye, baby.
Bye, guys.

-Hey, baby.
-A professional crier.
What the fuck is that?

35:20.839 --> 35:23.631
I get paid to go to,
you know, TV shows,
commercials.

35:23.714 --> 35:26.339
-Funerals sometimes.
-You get paid to go
to funerals and cry?

35:26.422 --> 35:28.756
-Yeah, it's my job.
It's what I do. Sometimes--
-The play.

35:28.839 --> 35:31.631
When you were crying
in the play, was that, was
that a job or was that real?

35:31.714 --> 35:34.172
No. No, it was real.
I mean, it was 10% more,

35:34.255 --> 35:35.964
-because that's what I'm paid,
but I would have cried--
-Did somebody pay you?

35:36.047 --> 35:37.589
-It was--
-Did Jeff pay you?

35:37.673 --> 35:40.589
-No. Honestly,
I'm not gonna have--
-So all of this is fake.

35:40.673 --> 35:42.005
None of this has been real.

35:42.089 --> 35:43.631
No, no, it isn't fake,
actually, Clive.

35:43.714 --> 35:45.464
-Isn't it?
-Yes, okay, it is fake!

35:45.547 --> 35:47.506
Is that what you
want to hear?
It's fake!
