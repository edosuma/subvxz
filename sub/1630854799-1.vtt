should sit and listen,

"What if you cause an action

"It's absurd to me that people

00:55.437 --> 00:58.348
"don't entrust
the future of this nation

00:58.399 --> 01:00.226
"to all of us,

the actual future

RANDALL WINSTON:
<i>Democracy</i>

02:21.523 --> 02:23.600
<i>must be learned
by each generation,</i>

02:23.651 --> 02:27.146
<i>and Youth & Government
really seeks to do that</i>

02:27.197 --> 02:30.316
<i>through a model
legislature program</i>

02:30.367 --> 02:32.650
<i>that sets up
a state government system</i>

02:32.701 --> 02:38.115
<i>with nearly 4,000 kids
taking over the state capital</i>

02:38.166 --> 02:40.408
<i>in the actual senate
and assembly chambers,</i>

02:40.459 --> 02:43.287
<i>in the actual governor's office,</i>

02:43.338 --> 02:44.495
<i>running government.</i>

02:44.546 --> 02:50.085
<i>Everything from passing
and debating legislation,</i>

02:50.136 --> 02:52.254
<i>vetoing or signing bills,</i>

02:52.305 --> 02:55.423
<i>passing an entire state budget,</i>

02:55.474 --> 02:56.716
<i>court cases,</i>

02:56.767 --> 02:59.094
<i>constitutional amendments,</i>

02:59.145 --> 03:04.775
<i>soup to nuts, kids take over
the state capital.</i>

03:05.567 --> 03:09.146
<i>I did Youth & Government
all throughout high school,</i>

03:09.197 --> 03:13.233
<i>ended up running
for governor in 1999,</i>

03:13.284 --> 03:14.193
<i>and winning.</i>

03:14.244 --> 03:18.863
<i>Later, I had a chance
to work for Governor Brown,</i>

03:18.914 --> 03:22.617
<i>for the governor's
chief of staff.</i>

03:22.668 --> 03:24.286
<i>And now in Youth & Government,</i>

03:24.337 --> 03:26.496
<i>I advise the youth governor,</i>

03:26.547 --> 03:30.250
<i>working with them
on their platform,</i>

03:30.301 --> 03:32.794
<i>implementation of their ideas,</i>

03:32.845 --> 03:34.088
<i>formation of their cabinet,</i>

03:34.139 --> 03:38.268
<i>and their vision
for the program.</i>

03:38.934 --> 03:41.594
<i>The youth governor
has to speak to perspectives</i>

03:41.645 --> 03:43.638
<i>about, you know,
what it means to lead.</i>

03:43.689 --> 03:46.849
- Like a position on them.
- Can you just, like, send...

03:46.900 --> 03:48.268
Yeah, yeah.
I'll send you the link.

03:48.319 --> 03:52.106
WINSTON: I think
there's some threshold

03:52.157 --> 03:54.274
<i>that's crossed here...</i>

03:54.325 --> 03:58.695
<i>where people become
comfortable taking risks,</i>

03:58.746 --> 04:03.418
<i>risks tied to politics.</i>

04:04.042 --> 04:06.754
[crowd murmuring]

04:08.964 --> 04:11.259
to the office before.

04:12.135 --> 04:13.635
Hi.

04:14.220 --> 04:17.714
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen!

04:17.765 --> 04:19.841
Welcome to the candidates'
meeting

04:19.892 --> 04:21.260
for the youth governor.

04:21.311 --> 04:23.511
Just to make sure that
we're all on the same page

04:23.562 --> 04:25.722
about what it means
to be youth governor,

04:25.773 --> 04:26.639
you, first and foremost,

04:26.690 --> 04:27.890
will be the face of the program.

04:27.941 --> 04:30.643
Each of you have been
assigned a political party.

04:30.694 --> 04:31.936
So the primaries will happen,

04:31.987 --> 04:34.021
and then we will make
a big announcement

04:34.072 --> 04:35.022
of the top six nominees

04:35.073 --> 04:36.691
from the different
political parties

04:36.742 --> 04:37.984
Moving forward, those top six

04:38.035 --> 04:39.319
will be narrowed down to three.

04:39.370 --> 04:41.654
For those top three
that move on to Sacramento,

04:41.705 --> 04:43.698
we will narrow it down
to the top two,

04:43.749 --> 04:45.492
and then those top two
will be elected

04:45.543 --> 04:47.034
in the traditional
convention style

04:47.085 --> 04:48.828
at the closing
Governor's Banquet.

04:48.879 --> 04:51.248
That being said,
I want to introduce to you

04:51.299 --> 04:52.458
the 71st Youth Governor

04:52.509 --> 04:55.210
to give you
some parting words of wisdom.

04:55.261 --> 04:57.930
[crowd cheering]

05:00.599 --> 05:02.301
Anyone who's run
for youth governor

05:02.352 --> 05:03.218
can vouch for this.

05:03.269 --> 05:05.052
You guys are running
for the biggest position

05:05.103 --> 05:06.763
in the program.
It's a lot of pressure.

05:06.814 --> 05:08.348
Make sure that
you're not just running

05:08.399 --> 05:09.599
for this position to have power.

05:09.650 --> 05:10.975
Make sure you're running
for this position

05:11.026 --> 05:13.561
because you want to have
something said in this program.

05:13.612 --> 05:15.314
Know what that is,
internalize that,

05:15.365 --> 05:16.856
and go out and campaign on that.

05:16.907 --> 05:19.369
[chanting]
How 'bout you?!

05:20.245 --> 05:23.322
I'm Noah Hilles. I'm running
for youth governor.

05:23.373 --> 05:24.822
We're in the same party.

05:24.873 --> 05:25.990
Hello, Youth & Government.

05:26.041 --> 05:26.866
Hello, Gold Party.

05:26.917 --> 05:28.410
Good afternoon, folks.
I'm Tate Oien from SDSC.

05:28.461 --> 05:31.037
Hi. My name's Stephanie Ortiz
from the Weingart East Los...

05:31.088 --> 05:32.705
My name's Caleb Crain
from the Palisades YMCA.

05:32.756 --> 05:34.374
My name's Piper Samuels,
and I'm running to serve...

05:34.425 --> 05:36.042
- Running to be your...
- Running to be your...

05:36.093 --> 05:39.254
- your 72nd...
- your 72nd youth governor.

05:39.305 --> 05:41.964
I stand for you, no matter
your political affiliation.

05:42.015 --> 05:44.468
I'm running as a fiscally
responsible candidate.

05:44.519 --> 05:47.136
Just imagine
the $1.5 billion

05:47.188 --> 05:50.390
that super PACs usually
spend every election season.

05:50.441 --> 05:52.016
Climate change
is wreaking havoc...

05:52.067 --> 05:53.017
Y&G is bipartisanship.

05:53.068 --> 05:55.144
This is the new normal
in America,

05:55.196 --> 05:56.062
and I'm tired of it.

05:56.113 --> 05:59.774
If we are the most progressive
state in the union,

05:59.825 --> 06:00.817
why are we falling behind?

06:00.868 --> 06:02.860
As the future,
Youth & Government

06:02.911 --> 06:04.571
can and will better
our leadership

06:04.622 --> 06:06.614
for this generation
and the next.

06:06.665 --> 06:09.335
[crowd cheering]

06:10.628 --> 06:13.788
It is now my honor to announce
the top six candidates

06:13.839 --> 06:19.512
who will be moving on as your
72nd Youth Governor finalists.

06:21.556 --> 06:25.310
The 72nd Youth Governor
nominees are...

06:26.269 --> 06:28.271
from the Gold Party...

06:28.563 --> 06:30.222
Bayo Collins.

06:30.273 --> 06:32.900
[cheering]

06:37.029 --> 06:39.273
Right now, my mindset
is that I'm gonna win,

06:39.324 --> 06:40.731
because the only way
to go into it

06:40.782 --> 06:43.578
is to see yourself
on that stage winning.

06:43.785 --> 06:44.652
Hello. I am Bayo Collins

06:44.703 --> 06:46.112
from the Greater
Long Beach delegation.

06:46.163 --> 06:50.242
Outside of Y&G, politics can
be a very toxic environment.

06:50.293 --> 06:51.659
Let's say you
get invited to dinner.

06:51.710 --> 06:53.370
One of the rules is
not to talk about politics,

06:53.421 --> 06:55.913
because, you know, it
divides people at this point.

06:55.964 --> 06:57.915
<i>So you gotta put
your actions to work.</i>

06:57.966 --> 07:00.835
You gotta put your money
where your mouth is basically

07:00.886 --> 07:02.597
and act on it.

07:07.184 --> 07:10.136
From the Redwood Party...

07:10.187 --> 07:11.178
Tate Oien.

07:11.229 --> 07:13.857
[cheering]

07:15.192 --> 07:16.518
This next generation
is going to be

07:16.569 --> 07:18.437
a very different generation.
We're gonna be a generation

07:18.488 --> 07:19.729
that cares about public service

07:19.780 --> 07:21.565
and a generation
that changes people's minds

07:21.616 --> 07:24.910
about the morality
of politics in general.

07:25.077 --> 07:26.570
I'm tired
of thoughts and prayers.

07:26.621 --> 07:27.945
And most of all,
I am tired of watching

07:27.996 --> 07:32.492
my fellow Californians die
while our legislators sit idle.

07:32.543 --> 07:35.495
And I'm also tired
of not taking a stand myself.

07:35.546 --> 07:37.664
<i>Politics doesn't
have to be dirty.</i>

07:37.715 --> 07:39.291
It doesn't have to be
like <i>House of Cards,</i>

07:39.342 --> 07:41.751
and it doesn't have to be
a game of corruption

07:41.802 --> 07:44.389
and greed and things like that.

07:47.140 --> 07:49.477
From the Grizzly Party...

07:49.810 --> 07:51.093
Solomon Kim.

07:51.144 --> 07:53.772
[cheering]

07:56.024 --> 07:57.975
<i>Seeking discomfort is...
That's my platform,</i>

07:58.026 --> 08:00.227
<i>being comfortable
with the uncomfortable.</i>

08:00.278 --> 08:01.812
What's more uncomfortable
than to be running

08:01.863 --> 08:03.607
for youth governor
for California?

08:03.658 --> 08:05.567
And that's why I'm running

08:05.618 --> 08:07.109
to be your next youth governor,

08:07.160 --> 08:08.570
step outside of my comfort zone

08:08.621 --> 08:12.491
and inspire 3,000 other
delegates to do the same.

08:12.542 --> 08:14.784
KIM: I guess
the pressure is on.

08:14.835 --> 08:16.786
<i>Everyone's extremely talented.</i>

08:16.837 --> 08:19.840
<i>It's gonna be a tough race.</i>

08:20.799 --> 08:22.626
From the Poppy Party...

08:22.677 --> 08:24.670
Alex Goldbeck.

08:24.721 --> 08:27.390
[cheering]

08:27.931 --> 08:29.757
<i>The last 52 hours, to be honest,</i>

08:29.808 --> 08:32.552
<i>have been very long
and interesting.</i>

08:32.603 --> 08:34.721
It was scary for me
to open up my speech

08:34.772 --> 08:36.263
by saying,
"I-I'm lucky to be here."

08:36.314 --> 08:39.266
The rest of my delegation
could not make the trip,

08:39.317 --> 08:41.769
as my community faces
both the tragedies

08:41.820 --> 08:45.482
of a mass shooting
and a raging wildfire.

08:45.533 --> 08:48.568
I'm here
because we are resilient.

08:48.619 --> 08:51.195
<i>I went to school on Thursday.</i>

08:51.246 --> 08:52.531
Like, it was about 12 hours

08:52.582 --> 08:54.907
after the Borderline
Bar and Grill shooting,

08:54.958 --> 08:58.453
which was about 10 minutes
away from my house.

08:58.504 --> 09:00.162
We didn't even
get to process that

09:00.213 --> 09:02.248
before we looked in the backyard

09:02.299 --> 09:04.626
and the hill was on fire.

09:04.677 --> 09:05.752
<i>Police knocked on my door</i>

09:05.803 --> 09:07.962
<i>and said,
"You need to get out now."</i>

09:08.013 --> 09:09.964
<i>I have friends
who evacuated places,</i>

09:10.015 --> 09:11.466
<i>calling me, saying,
"Remember, like,</i>

09:11.517 --> 09:13.385
<i>you told me
you wanted to do this."</i>

09:13.436 --> 09:15.429
That's what's pushing me
through all of this,

09:15.480 --> 09:18.390
even though it's
the hardest thing I've done.

09:18.441 --> 09:20.099
[crowd cheering]

09:20.150 --> 09:23.102
And from the Avocado Party,

09:23.153 --> 09:24.604
Aidan Blain.

09:24.655 --> 09:27.282
[cheering]

09:29.159 --> 09:31.737
<i>I've had some experience,
especially in politics.</i>

09:31.788 --> 09:33.530
I volunteered...
One of the campaigns

09:33.581 --> 09:34.573
I actually volunteered for

09:34.624 --> 09:36.991
is Mike Levin's
Congressional 49th District.

09:37.042 --> 09:40.077
And that experience,
talking to voters,

09:40.128 --> 09:42.706
phone banking, canvassing,
all of that,

09:42.757 --> 09:45.792
I'm applying it directly into
my youth governor campaign.

09:45.843 --> 09:48.754
I mean, Youth & Government
and the real world,

09:48.805 --> 09:49.671
it's not that different.

09:49.722 --> 09:52.840
How are we going to increase
millennial voter turnout

09:52.891 --> 09:55.885
if we aren't educating people
about our government?

09:55.936 --> 09:57.554
<i>I just hate this idea
that candidates</i>

09:57.605 --> 09:58.722
<i>are, like, godlike figures.</i>

09:58.773 --> 10:00.390
<i>Yeah, maybe I'm
running for youth governor,</i>

10:00.441 --> 10:02.559
<i>but that doesn't mean
I'm better than someone else.</i>

10:02.610 --> 10:04.770
I want to be, like,
a real person to them

10:04.821 --> 10:06.103
and not just
some youth governor.

10:06.154 --> 10:07.773
I don't want to be a candidate.

10:07.824 --> 10:09.908
I want to be Aidan Blain.

10:10.951 --> 10:13.328
From the Trout Party...

10:13.663 --> 10:15.237
Piper Samuels.

10:15.288 --> 10:17.364
[cheering]

10:17.415 --> 10:20.201
<i>I don't think adults
can fully understand</i>

10:20.252 --> 10:21.745
<i>the amount of actual work</i>

10:21.796 --> 10:23.954
<i>that we put into this program.</i>

10:24.005 --> 10:24.955
I always say, you know,

10:25.006 --> 10:26.874
it's a mock government program,

10:26.925 --> 10:28.250
but it feels real to us.

10:28.301 --> 10:29.251
<i>The social politics,</i>

10:29.302 --> 10:32.379
<i>those totally model
the actual government.</i>

10:32.430 --> 10:34.841
Couple of the ideas that I
want to prioritize the most

10:34.892 --> 10:39.136
are inequity in education,
uh, the homelessness crisis,

10:39.187 --> 10:40.639
and criminal justice reform.

10:40.690 --> 10:43.683
If I win, I'm gonna keep going.

10:43.734 --> 10:45.935
You know, I'm gonna
keep talking to people

10:45.986 --> 10:50.231
just full throttle,
all in if I win.

10:50.282 --> 10:52.951
[crowd cheering]

10:58.875 --> 11:01.627
[music playing]

11:05.213 --> 11:07.541
Can we please get
a round of applause,

11:07.592 --> 11:08.875
not only for these candidates,

11:08.926 --> 11:11.628
but all the candidates
for any position.

11:11.679 --> 11:14.097
[crowd cheering]

11:19.102 --> 11:21.313
[music fades]

[no audible dialogue]

11:26.401 --> 11:29.154
[music playing]

11:36.995 --> 11:37.863
<i>- Hello.
</i>- Hi.

11:37.914 --> 11:38.864
<i>How you doing? You okay?</i>

11:38.915 --> 11:41.825
Yeah, I'm fine.
I actually slept last night.

11:41.876 --> 11:43.785
So how's the house
and everything?

11:43.836 --> 11:45.452
<i>Everything's fine.</i>

11:45.503 --> 11:46.453
<i>No damage to our house,</i>

11:46.504 --> 11:47.914
<i>but there's houses in the area,</i>

11:47.965 --> 11:52.001
<i>and everything on the hills
is black from the fire.</i>

11:52.052 --> 11:53.127
<i>It looks like a moonscape.</i>

11:53.178 --> 11:55.755
<i>Our friend Gill,
his house burnt down.</i>

11:55.806 --> 11:56.798
Okay, so we're still under

11:56.849 --> 11:58.257
- mandatory evacuation, then.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

11:58.308 --> 12:00.176
Everything... Like, I have
all my stuffed animals here

12:00.227 --> 12:01.720
and stuff, like,
they all smell like smoke,

12:01.771 --> 12:03.805
so, like, when I sleep,
I... like, I get whiffs of it.

12:03.856 --> 12:06.098
<i>Yeah. Um, that's gonna happen
for a while. The house...</i>

12:06.149 --> 12:08.350
<i>There's people
that lost houses and stuff,</i>

12:08.401 --> 12:11.061
<i>so, I mean, we're
the lucky ones, but...</i>

12:11.112 --> 12:12.731
<i>you did your job.
You did what you did.</i>

12:12.782 --> 12:15.149
<i>It's good that you're there
representing your delegation.</i>

12:15.200 --> 12:16.818
<i>And the people here,
it's very... you know,</i>

12:16.869 --> 12:19.821
<i>and there's gonna be
a lot of work to be done.</i>

12:19.872 --> 12:22.625
[music playing]

12:48.651 --> 12:50.977
<i>I honestly thought
I did horrible.</i>

12:51.028 --> 12:53.020
<i>I was like,
"I probably didn't win.</i>

12:53.071 --> 12:55.356
<i>"Like, what's the point
of me staying an extra day?</i>

12:55.407 --> 12:57.107
<i>"Like, I want to be
with my family.</i>

12:57.158 --> 12:58.610
<i>I want to be
with my friends."</i>

12:58.661 --> 13:00.152
<i>And that was definitely, like,</i>

13:00.203 --> 13:03.040
<i>a really hard night for me.</i>

13:03.164 --> 13:04.448
The suitcase
I brought to T&E one

13:04.499 --> 13:09.504
was everything that I had
just packed for evacuating.

13:10.923 --> 13:13.207
<i>Sometimes you look
at the national news,</i>

13:13.258 --> 13:14.751
<i>and all you hear is fighting.</i>

13:14.802 --> 13:16.252
<i>They're fighting
about our community.</i>

13:16.303 --> 13:18.880
<i>They're fighting about
the shooting afterwards.</i>

13:18.931 --> 13:21.716
<i>It's hard to watch
your hometown become</i>

13:21.767 --> 13:24.010
<i>one of those circles,
like, on the map.</i>

13:24.061 --> 13:26.470
REPORTER: The community
of Thousand Oaks, California,

13:26.521 --> 13:29.641
<i>is grieving and trying to cope
with the unimaginable.</i>

13:29.692 --> 13:31.017
NRA agenda. Shame on you,

13:31.068 --> 13:32.268
and there's blood on your hands.

13:32.319 --> 13:33.812
<i>...to the Woolsey Fire,
which is not far</i>

13:33.863 --> 13:35.647
<i>from the scene of Wednesday
night's mass shooting...</i>

13:35.698 --> 13:37.857
<i>...President Trump is
threatening to cut off...</i>

13:37.908 --> 13:38.984
<i>"...no more Fed payments."</i>

13:39.035 --> 13:40.944
Tweet is not
a function of government...

13:40.995 --> 13:42.111
Should have been
all raked out...

13:42.162 --> 13:44.196
- What about the argument...
- You wouldn't have the fires.

13:44.247 --> 13:47.417
<i>What about the argument
it's climate change?</i>

13:53.131 --> 13:55.917
GOLDBECK: We're kind of
that first generation

13:55.968 --> 13:57.376
<i>coming after 9/11.</i>

13:57.427 --> 14:00.546
<i>We're that generation of safety.</i>

14:00.597 --> 14:03.299
But yet a lot of us
don't feel safe

14:03.350 --> 14:05.927
in going to the supermarket
or going to school,

14:05.978 --> 14:07.553
where you're supposed
to feel you're safest.

14:07.604 --> 14:11.557
We're stuck in a time where
we have different epidemics,

14:11.608 --> 14:14.769
um, looking at
mass-shooting epidemics

14:14.820 --> 14:16.520
and fires across the nation.

14:16.571 --> 14:20.441
We're the ones that have
to grow up in an environment

14:20.492 --> 14:22.192
that is constantly changing.

14:22.243 --> 14:25.195
That's where we're kind of
becoming that movement

14:25.246 --> 14:27.448
of, "Stop looking
at the older generation.

14:27.499 --> 14:30.836
Start looking at the way
it's affecting us."

14:35.465 --> 14:38.218
[music playing]

14:47.352 --> 14:50.847
COLLINS: I don't talk
about politics here, really.

14:50.898 --> 14:53.850
<i>Most kids aren't interested
in hearing about it,</i>

14:53.901 --> 14:56.444
<i>so I don't talk about it.</i>

15:00.490 --> 15:03.109
Chapter 7, it starts Monday.

15:03.160 --> 15:06.905
Have a good weekend.
Stay out of trouble.

15:06.956 --> 15:07.864
[overlapping chatter]

15:07.915 --> 15:09.115
All right, Levi.
Good luck, bro.

15:09.166 --> 15:10.992
Well, I don't...
Hey, do you want me to...

15:11.043 --> 15:12.827
I'm like,
"Finish your test, bro."

15:12.878 --> 15:16.256
[music playing]

15:17.298 --> 15:19.793
<i>Long Beach,
which is where I live,</i>

15:19.844 --> 15:20.835
<i>it's a really nice city.</i>

15:20.886 --> 15:24.421
<i>Long Beach Poly, my school's
like the staple high school.</i>

15:24.472 --> 15:26.132
<i>Like, we're really known
for our sports.</i>

15:26.183 --> 15:29.259
<i>There's, like,
national coverage for that.</i>

15:29.310 --> 15:31.012
<i>We have a lot of,
like, NFL players,</i>

15:31.063 --> 15:35.608
<i>basketball players,
right now and in the past.</i>

15:37.277 --> 15:40.187
What's up, bro? [laughs]

15:40.238 --> 15:40.980
What's good, man?

15:41.031 --> 15:42.314
- What's up, man?
- Oh, yeah.

15:42.365 --> 15:45.119
[music playing]

15:46.327 --> 15:47.904
<i>When I first got there,
it was like,</i>

15:47.955 --> 15:49.405
<i>"Wow, this is a lot of people,"</i>

15:49.456 --> 15:51.825
<i>so sometimes you feel
kind of small.</i>

15:51.876 --> 15:53.575
<i>All the athletes
got their camera crew.</i>

15:53.626 --> 15:57.163
<i>PACE kids going to Stanford
and this and that.</i>

15:57.214 --> 15:59.916
<i>Sometimes I feel like, "Man,
I'm doing all this stuff,</i>

15:59.967 --> 16:02.418
<i>and, like, seem like
nobody cares at all."</i>

16:02.469 --> 16:03.460
<i>Like, the sports team,</i>

16:03.511 --> 16:05.379
<i>they lose in the first round
of the playoffs,</i>

16:05.430 --> 16:07.381
<i>and they get
a newspaper article.</i>

16:07.432 --> 16:09.008
[laughter]

16:09.059 --> 16:10.051
All right, bro.

16:10.102 --> 16:12.229
- All right.
- All right, bro.

16:14.106 --> 16:15.597
<i>I identify as African-American.</i>

16:15.648 --> 16:18.559
<i>I can identify with other
Nigerians I seen at school.</i>

16:18.610 --> 16:21.104
In my campaign group, there
was a girl that's Nigerian,

16:21.155 --> 16:24.440
and that's how we connected,
so it's a way to connect.

16:24.491 --> 16:25.774
[buzzer rings]

16:25.826 --> 16:27.902
<i>But I try to stay away
from race in Y&G,</i>

16:27.953 --> 16:30.737
<i>because you don't want people
to just label you like...</i>

16:30.788 --> 16:32.656
<i>Like they just see
the Black guy, so, like...</i>

16:32.707 --> 16:37.295
<i>I want to have, like,
an identity outside of that.</i>

16:37.880 --> 16:40.372
<i>I have an opportunity
to show, like,</i>

16:40.423 --> 16:41.582
<i>there's more to be successful</i>

16:41.633 --> 16:43.084
<i>than sports and stuff like that,</i>

16:43.135 --> 16:45.461
<i>that you can get recognition
for other things.</i>

16:45.512 --> 16:47.254
<i>And I know that it's
gonna pay off,</i>

16:47.305 --> 16:51.268
<i>so just keep doing
what I'm doing.</i>

16:56.814 --> 17:00.945
BLAIN: I've been running ever
since I was a little kid.

17:01.946 --> 17:03.437
<i>I was always, like, fast.</i>

17:03.488 --> 17:05.481
<i>Then in high school,
I started, like,</i>

17:05.532 --> 17:07.441
<i>really getting serious
about track.</i>

17:07.492 --> 17:11.196
<i>This year was the best we've
ever been at our relays.</i>

17:11.247 --> 17:14.499
<i>We're seventh in the nation
right now.</i>

17:16.417 --> 17:17.743
<i>Track is hard,</i>

17:17.794 --> 17:20.329
<i>especially being on a good team.</i>

17:20.380 --> 17:21.956
I've been focusing a lot
on, like, my mentality,

17:22.007 --> 17:24.250
and, like, one of my things
my dad keeps telling me

17:24.301 --> 17:26.335
is that I have to tell myself
I believe it.

17:26.386 --> 17:28.670
<i>Like, think that
I can go out there</i>

17:28.721 --> 17:30.215
<i>and do whatever
I can set my mind to,</i>

17:30.266 --> 17:31.925
<i>and it's very similar
with Youth & Government.</i>

17:31.976 --> 17:35.178
<i>I told myself that I can
go out there and I can do it</i>

17:35.229 --> 17:36.345
<i>and I could actually win it,</i>

17:36.396 --> 17:37.889
<i>even though
it was 29 candidates,</i>

17:37.940 --> 17:40.225
<i>even though it was something
I've kind of looked at</i>

17:40.276 --> 17:42.903
<i>as, like, almost impossible.</i>

17:45.863 --> 17:47.615
[whistle blows]

17:49.076 --> 17:50.609
<i>Having
a really strong work ethic</i>

17:50.660 --> 17:52.611
<i>is just something that's
kind of ingrained in me.</i>

17:52.662 --> 17:56.199
<i>My dad is a really hard worker,</i>

17:56.250 --> 17:59.743
<i>and he makes sure
that everything he does</i>

17:59.794 --> 18:00.869
<i>is done really well.</i>

18:00.921 --> 18:04.373
<i>Like, if I make my bed
and it's not made well,</i>

18:04.424 --> 18:06.884
<i>he'll say, "Do it again."</i>

18:09.138 --> 18:10.046
<i>I'm an only child,</i>

18:10.097 --> 18:12.589
<i>but I've basically grown up
with my parents divorced.</i>

18:12.640 --> 18:15.927
<i>Back when I was,
like, in middle school,</i>

18:15.978 --> 18:17.469
<i>my parents fought a lot.</i>

18:17.520 --> 18:20.223
<i>All the kind of competitiveness</i>

18:20.274 --> 18:24.361
<i>just like almost
a tug-of-war sometimes.</i>

18:24.444 --> 18:25.394
<i>Like, I love my parents,</i>

18:25.445 --> 18:27.771
<i>but I'm definitely ready
to live on my own.</i>

18:27.822 --> 18:29.690
<i>It's a mixture
of being an adult,</i>

18:29.741 --> 18:31.826
<i>but also being a kid.</i>

18:35.205 --> 18:39.533
SAMUELS:<i>The rest of the kids
at school hate Y&G kids.</i>

18:39.584 --> 18:41.535
<i>We're made fun of all the time</i>

18:41.586 --> 18:46.540
<i>because we have so much pride
for being in Y&G,</i>

18:46.591 --> 18:47.708
<i>but at least, at my school,</i>

18:47.759 --> 18:49.543
<i>like, Y&G's kind of an escape</i>

18:49.594 --> 18:53.214
<i>from, like, the typical
high school experience.</i>

18:53.265 --> 18:55.258
<i>Every time we come back
from a conference,</i>

18:55.309 --> 18:57.426
<i>people are posting
on Instagram or Twitter</i>

18:57.477 --> 18:59.386
<i>about how they had a great time.</i>

18:59.437 --> 19:02.265
<i>There's always two times
the amount of people</i>

19:02.316 --> 19:04.734
<i>making fun of them.</i>

19:05.069 --> 19:08.946
<i>They... They just don't get it.</i>

19:09.031 --> 19:12.317
<i>It's hard, because you
can't fully understand</i>

19:12.368 --> 19:14.484
<i>what Y&G is until you're in it.</i>

19:14.535 --> 19:17.613
<i>It's nothing like mock trial
or speech and debate,</i>

19:17.664 --> 19:18.947
<i>where you're all still students.</i>

19:18.999 --> 19:20.616
<i>Like, you really do
take on the roles</i>

19:20.667 --> 19:22.743
<i>of the characters
that you're playing,</i>

19:22.794 --> 19:24.703
<i>like the character of a senator</i>

19:24.754 --> 19:26.039
<i>or governor candidate.</i>

19:26.090 --> 19:30.376
- Testing again.
- WOMAN: It's great.

19:30.427 --> 19:32.253
<i>It's this thing
that you care so much about</i>

19:32.304 --> 19:36.341
<i>and are dedicating
so much of your life to.</i>

19:36.392 --> 19:37.342
<i>So many of your friends,</i>

19:37.393 --> 19:39.093
<i>you only met
because of this thing,</i>

19:39.144 --> 19:40.552
<i>so, yes, you care
a lot about it,</i>

19:40.603 --> 19:43.805
<i>but it also... you have
a personal connection to it.</i>

19:43.856 --> 19:45.391
<i>And that's an environment</i>

19:45.442 --> 19:48.935
<i>where a lot of high schoolers
thrive more,</i>

19:48.986 --> 19:51.772
<i>because we don't
like sitting at desks</i>

19:51.823 --> 19:53.149
<i>for seven hours a day.</i>

19:53.200 --> 19:55.276
<i>Everyone's always just like,</i>

19:55.327 --> 19:58.288
<i>"I wish I was back at Y&G."</i>

19:59.081 --> 20:01.749
[crowd cheering]

20:06.422 --> 20:08.997
I would now like to call
the opening session

20:09.049 --> 20:12.844
of Training and Elections 2
to order.

20:13.220 --> 20:16.265
[cheering]

20:18.225 --> 20:20.592
[no audible dialogue]

20:20.643 --> 20:22.552
Too often, we feel the need

20:22.603 --> 20:26.182
to check all the boxes
of the party we side with.

20:26.233 --> 20:28.184
We make it a part
of our identity,

20:28.235 --> 20:32.188
and that identification
becomes our "ride or die."

20:32.239 --> 20:34.991
[music playing]

20:37.286 --> 20:39.362
NAGATOSHI: When we're
at these conferences,

20:39.413 --> 20:40.821
<i>we're more than just teenagers</i>

20:40.872 --> 20:42.948
<i>aimlessly arguing
about politics.</i>

20:42.999 --> 20:45.659
We're teenagers
actively participating

20:45.710 --> 20:49.037
in the conversations
that our politicians

20:49.089 --> 20:50.206
have trouble addressing.

20:50.257 --> 20:52.458
"'Cause it's easier
to stand trial.

20:52.509 --> 20:54.085
If you do go to trial..."

20:54.136 --> 20:55.928
Gonna gather up.

20:56.305 --> 20:58.256
- I'm first?
- After you.

20:58.307 --> 20:59.849
Yeah.

21:00.850 --> 21:03.719
Fight for what you believe in,

21:03.770 --> 21:06.606
not what others tell you to.

21:06.689 --> 21:07.639
<i>Thank you, everyone,</i>

21:07.690 --> 21:10.194
<i>and have
an incredible conference.</i>

21:11.528 --> 21:14.198
[crowd cheering]

21:23.248 --> 21:26.000
[music playing]

21:44.769 --> 21:47.263

- Okay.

[crowd cheering]

21:51.859 --> 21:53.694
Is this on?

21:55.696 --> 21:56.605
Hi, everyone.

21:56.656 --> 21:57.606
My name is Aidan Blain,

21:57.657 --> 22:01.360
from the Santa Monica
Family YMCA,

22:01.411 --> 22:03.154
and I'm running
with the Avocado Party

22:03.205 --> 22:06.072
to serve as your
72nd Youth Governor.

22:06.123 --> 22:08.617
[cheering fades]

22:08.668 --> 22:10.702
DAVIS: Go to your...
Like, your win condition.

22:10.753 --> 22:12.037
<i>- What do you mean?
- Um...</i>

22:12.088 --> 22:14.165
"I, like, get to top three
because of this,

22:14.216 --> 22:15.500
"like because of
my speaking ability,

22:15.551 --> 22:17.210
because of my stage presence
because of my charisma."

22:17.261 --> 22:18.960
Speaking ability
and able to talk to people

22:19.011 --> 22:21.004
and connect with people,
definitely, 100%.

22:21.055 --> 22:22.964
Or, like, all right,
think bigger than California.

22:23.015 --> 22:25.301
National issues. So what's
your national-level issue?

22:25.352 --> 22:27.093
I did... I did address
something on drugs,

22:27.144 --> 22:28.136
um, but it was on opioids.

22:28.188 --> 22:31.182
But basically the fact that
2 million Americans per year

22:31.233 --> 22:34.310
suffer from acute
drug disorders from opioids,

22:34.361 --> 22:35.727
and they're legally prescribed,

22:35.778 --> 22:37.687
and it's not like they're
just getting them, like,

22:37.738 --> 22:39.357
from... on the streets.
Like, it's coming

22:39.408 --> 22:41.066
from their prescriptions
from their doctors.

22:41.117 --> 22:42.568
DAVIS:<i>I was talking
to Aidan before</i>

22:42.619 --> 22:44.110
<i>when we were running
for youth gov.</i>

22:44.161 --> 22:45.946
That's where he's like,
"I just want to talk to people.

22:45.997 --> 22:47.823
"I just want to interact.
I don't wanna be buying votes.

22:47.874 --> 22:49.825
I wanna be buying
experiences, basically."

22:49.876 --> 22:51.827
- Yeah.
- And I was like, "All right.

22:51.878 --> 22:52.661
This is the guy."

22:52.712 --> 22:53.620
Um, I'm Deven Radfar.

22:53.671 --> 22:55.789
Um, I'm the party chair
of the Avocado Party,

22:55.840 --> 22:57.542
um, the party
that Aidan's running out of.

22:57.593 --> 23:00.253
Oh, yeah. I'm Nate Davis,
Westchester Family Y.

23:00.304 --> 23:03.129
I'm his official
campaign manager.

23:03.180 --> 23:04.298
And my name's Will Sherman.

23:04.349 --> 23:06.384
I'm the president
of Aidan's delegation,

23:06.435 --> 23:10.011
and I am the unofficial
campaign advisor, but...

23:10.062 --> 23:11.472
- Absolutely.
- I pretty much... Yeah.

23:11.523 --> 23:13.558
It's the official
campaign advisor.

23:13.609 --> 23:15.351
RADFAR: Like,
the end of December,

23:15.402 --> 23:17.686
<i>beginning of January,
I think all three of us</i>

23:17.737 --> 23:18.854
<i>really came together and...</i>

23:18.905 --> 23:20.231
- Totally.
- We started that, like,

23:20.282 --> 23:22.608
passion and drive
for Aidan's campaign.

23:22.659 --> 23:25.486
BLAIN: How well a candidate
does is definitely

23:25.537 --> 23:28.822
<i>correlated with the team
that they have around them.</i>

23:28.873 --> 23:30.699
<i>If you have a...
A crappy campaign staff,</i>

23:30.750 --> 23:32.243
<i>you're not gonna win
at elections,</i>

23:32.294 --> 23:33.952
<i>'cause you're not gonna
have a good strategy.</i>

23:34.003 --> 23:35.912
<i>You're not gonna have
good publicity.</i>

23:35.963 --> 23:39.749
<i>But my team is fantastic.</i>

23:39.800 --> 23:41.209
Our final question is...

23:41.261 --> 23:43.169
what's your favorite
breakfast food,

23:43.220 --> 23:45.256
and what does
that say about you?

23:45.307 --> 23:47.633
What a beautiful
question this is.

23:47.684 --> 23:49.843
And my favorite
breakfast food is eggs.

23:49.894 --> 23:52.679
Probably breakfast burritos,
honestly. You know...

23:52.730 --> 23:53.472
Lucky Charms.

23:53.523 --> 23:54.848
Personally, I love waffles

23:54.899 --> 23:57.402
- almost as much as...
- [cheering]

23:57.569 --> 23:59.060
Okay, so I'd say my favorite

23:59.111 --> 24:01.104
breakfast food
is a breakfast buffet.

24:01.155 --> 24:03.441
Because with
a breakfast buffet...

24:03.492 --> 24:04.317
[scattered booing]

24:04.368 --> 24:06.860
you can get every single
food on your plate.

24:06.911 --> 24:08.613
That is diversity on a plate.

24:08.664 --> 24:12.866
That's what you get
in a buffet. [laughs]

24:12.917 --> 24:15.545
[cheering]

24:17.004 --> 24:19.164
BLAIN: Social media is
a huge part of campaigning.

24:19.215 --> 24:21.334
<i>Really the only way
to reach out to people</i>

24:21.385 --> 24:23.084
<i>is to post stuff on Instagram</i>

24:23.135 --> 24:24.210
<i>and basically let them see</i>

24:24.261 --> 24:25.546
<i>what I stand for as a candidate,</i>

24:25.597 --> 24:28.924
<i>what I... what my goals are
as a candidate.</i>

24:28.975 --> 24:31.009
<i>But getting memed
is definitely something</i>

24:31.060 --> 24:33.261
<i>that you get when you
run for a position.</i>

24:33.313 --> 24:35.972
<i>Some memes are nicer
than others.</i>

24:36.023 --> 24:37.642
<i>At opening joint session,
they asked me</i>

24:37.693 --> 24:39.560
<i>what my favorite
breakfast food was.</i>

24:39.611 --> 24:40.810
I said, "Buffet."

24:40.861 --> 24:43.522
You know what, sometimes
you say some things

24:43.573 --> 24:44.856
in front of 4,000 people,

24:44.907 --> 24:46.858
but I guess it's a thing now.

24:46.909 --> 24:48.444
DAVIS: As with
any group of teens,

24:48.495 --> 24:49.612
<i>we've got an anonymous app,</i>

24:49.663 --> 24:52.531
<i>and that just went about
as well as you think it is.</i>

24:52.582 --> 24:53.491
<i>It's called Yodel.</i>

24:53.542 --> 24:54.866
So, like, people try and go in

24:54.917 --> 24:55.992
and make it look like there's

24:56.043 --> 24:57.286
a lot of support
for this candidate

24:57.337 --> 24:58.579
or everyone hates
this candidate.

24:58.630 --> 25:00.289
DAVIS:<i>Of course you're
gonna have a couple kids</i>

25:00.340 --> 25:02.416
<i>who go on Yodel, and they're
like, "I hate Aidan Blain."</i>

25:02.467 --> 25:03.917
RADFAR:<i>It's
the unfortunate reality,</i>

25:03.968 --> 25:05.378
<i>but it's got into Aidan's head.</i>

25:05.429 --> 25:07.003
<i>It definitely has.
It got to the point</i>

25:07.054 --> 25:10.016
<i>where I had to delete it
off his phone.</i>

25:11.058 --> 25:12.050
"Why am I most qualified?"

25:12.101 --> 25:13.511
I feel like,
as far as my experience

25:13.562 --> 25:15.388
in Youth & Government,
being pro-tem last year,

25:15.439 --> 25:18.557
my first year, proves that
I'm more than qualified

25:18.608 --> 25:20.183
as any other candidate, and also

25:20.234 --> 25:23.061
I feel like I'm able
to talk to most people.

25:23.112 --> 25:24.397
They're able to connect with me.

25:24.448 --> 25:26.231
I'm real down-to-earth.
Like, you know, I'm just,

25:26.282 --> 25:27.733
like, not an untouchable figure.

25:27.784 --> 25:29.568
I feel like I'm
the right man for the job,

25:29.619 --> 25:31.861

To be quite honest, so...

That's cool.

- No.
- I know that one too well.

26:07.948 --> 26:10.443
Yeah. Yeah, I mean,
I already put up a video

26:10.494 --> 26:11.569
for, like, who I am already,

26:11.620 --> 26:14.279
so I want to also, like,
add, you know, platform stuff.

26:14.330 --> 26:16.906
I think I'm a good candidate
for youth governor,

26:16.957 --> 26:18.784
because I'm able
to bring people together

26:18.835 --> 26:21.161
and bring multiple
perspectives to the table,

26:21.212 --> 26:23.664

a sense of community...

26:25.509 --> 26:27.083

26:45.152 --> 26:49.732
Okay, my idea is to
abolish affirmative action

26:49.783 --> 26:50.649
and make it merit-based.

26:50.700 --> 26:53.860
Come in legally so they
can pay their correct taxes

26:53.911 --> 26:54.903

26:54.954 --> 26:56.237

the Trout Party stands today.

We've been discussing

27:13.931 --> 27:15.633
candidacy within
the Trout Party,

27:15.684 --> 27:19.135

that I need to use

<i>The answers to the quiz

<i>but I think there were
more so of those</i>

27:40.917 --> 27:43.577
<i>in the Trout Party because
of its conservative nature</i>

there are in California.</i>

27:47.131 --> 27:47.997

As a liberal,
I can't, like, speak

27:49.843 --> 27:51.126
to the conservative experience.

27:51.177 --> 27:53.253
The closest I would get
would be, like, me being

27:53.304 --> 27:54.337
in that Trout Party session.

27:54.388 --> 27:56.757
Genuinely afraid of, like,

<i>I feel bad,

I'm their representative.</i>

28:12.239 --> 28:13.398
If you're in the Trout Party,

28:13.449 --> 28:14.983
there's not
a single more passionate

28:15.034 --> 28:16.943
and more energetic party
in all of Y&G,

28:16.994 --> 28:19.738

if you're not going to Trout,

28:19.789 --> 28:22.365
talk to someone who's in Trout.
And I'm also here to tell you

28:22.416 --> 28:25.118

<i>Being conservative

29:46.333 --> 29:48.619
and I'm honored
to present to you the bills

29:48.670 --> 29:50.913
that Trout strongly supports,

29:50.964 --> 29:52.665
so bear with me.

29:52.716 --> 29:56.376
The Trout Party
strongly supports 4315,

29:56.427 --> 29:59.379
tax cuts for corporations
donating food to charity

29:59.430 --> 30:02.131
equal to 50% of the market cost.

30:02.182 --> 30:03.383
SAMUELS:
<i>Ethan disagrees with me</i>

30:03.434 --> 30:05.343
<i>politically in a lot of ways,</i>

30:05.394 --> 30:10.098
<i>but he really wants me
to get the conservative vote,</i>

30:10.149 --> 30:12.058
<i>because him and I really do have</i>

30:12.109 --> 30:13.184
<i>a respect for each other.</i>

30:13.235 --> 30:15.938
<i>And we know that we disagree,</i>

30:15.989 --> 30:17.146
<i>but he'll try to tell me</i>

30:17.197 --> 30:20.149
<i>certain conservative
standpoints I should take</i>

30:20.200 --> 30:22.193
<i>that I might
actually agree with.</i>

30:22.244 --> 30:24.570
<i>Yeah, I don't know
if I will be able to run</i>

30:24.621 --> 30:27.658
<i>with a platform that I
don't fully agree with</i>

30:27.709 --> 30:30.410
<i>or I don't think
is the most important</i>

30:30.461 --> 30:32.120
<i>for us to be supporting.</i>

30:32.171 --> 30:34.539
<i>But I'd rather
them not vote for me</i>

30:34.590 --> 30:35.581
<i>for the right reasons</i>

30:35.632 --> 30:37.793
<i>than vote for me
for the wrong reasons.</i>

30:37.844 --> 30:41.462
Now I'd like to give
a big round of applause

30:41.513 --> 30:44.507
for our youth governor
candidate, Piper Samuels.

30:44.558 --> 30:47.186
[applause]

30:58.073 --> 30:59.188
Hello, everyone.

30:59.239 --> 31:01.942
I'm Piper Samuels,
running with the Trout Party

31:01.993 --> 31:05.153
to serve as your
72nd Youth Governor.

31:05.204 --> 31:07.832
[applause]

31:11.086 --> 31:14.495
It's been a while since I've
last spoken to you all,

31:14.546 --> 31:18.751
and I'm not here to try to
sell you lies about who I am.

31:18.802 --> 31:21.627
The fact of the matter is
that my political views

31:21.678 --> 31:24.213
are different from many
of yours in this party,

31:24.264 --> 31:26.759
but that doesn't mean
I won't support you

31:26.810 --> 31:29.135
and your right
to your own opinions.

31:29.186 --> 31:31.220
Because of my political views,
you might think

31:31.271 --> 31:33.807
that I'm not the best
candidate to represent you,

31:33.858 --> 31:36.392
but the truth is
I'm the only one who can.

31:36.443 --> 31:40.229
When I move forward, I'm not
going to leave you behind.

31:40.280 --> 31:42.357
If you push me ahead,
I will bring you with me

31:42.408 --> 31:45.903
and fight for fair
representation and justice.

31:45.954 --> 31:47.403
I can't fix the system now,

31:47.454 --> 31:50.281
but if you vote for me,
I can, and I will.

31:50.332 --> 31:51.700
Thank you.
My name is Piper Samuels,

31:51.751 --> 31:55.286
and I'm running to serve
as your 72nd youth governor.

31:55.337 --> 31:58.382
[cheering]

31:59.968 --> 32:02.753
OIEN:<i>Every candidate
is trying to get voters</i>

32:02.804 --> 32:07.142
<i>from their other candidates'
parties to vote for them.</i>

32:09.393 --> 32:11.552
<i>Even though people
might agree heavily</i>

32:11.603 --> 32:13.388
<i>with their party's platform,
they're still</i>

32:13.439 --> 32:14.890
<i>at the end of the day gonna vote</i>

32:14.941 --> 32:16.349
<i>for the candidate
that they think</i>

32:16.400 --> 32:18.852
<i>is going to do
the best job in the office.</i>

32:18.903 --> 32:20.603
You are the person who's closest

32:20.654 --> 32:21.855
to having the conservative vote.

32:21.906 --> 32:23.857
You've been at CDC
for the last few years

32:23.908 --> 32:25.233
and stuff like that.
Take it.

32:25.284 --> 32:26.275
- It's yours.
- Okay.

32:26.326 --> 32:27.485
<i>It's not a bad idea to appeal</i>

32:27.536 --> 32:29.570
<i>to the conservative side,
because it's a vote</i>

32:29.621 --> 32:31.280
<i>that you are still
trying to secure.</i>

32:31.331 --> 32:33.992
OIEN:<i>It's gonna be
a contentious election.</i>

32:34.043 --> 32:36.411
<i>There's just
so many good candidates.</i>

32:36.462 --> 32:38.204
The most important
thing for me to do

32:38.255 --> 32:39.664
is just get my face out there,

32:39.715 --> 32:41.207
make sure people know
what I advocate for

32:41.258 --> 32:43.751
and just, you know, like,
make people have a fun time,

32:43.803 --> 32:46.171
because that's definitely
part of being youth governor

32:46.222 --> 32:49.465
is just being that, like...

32:49.516 --> 32:52.052
it's a weird word, but,
like, being that hype-beast

32:52.103 --> 32:54.470
that everyone needs to be.

32:54.521 --> 32:57.473
What is up, epic comrades?

32:57.524 --> 32:59.651
[cheering]

33:00.236 --> 33:01.103
I think you all know me.

33:01.154 --> 33:03.814
My name is Tate Oien from SDSC.

33:03.865 --> 33:04.689
[crowd] S.D.!

33:04.740 --> 33:06.108
I'm running
with the Redwood Party

33:06.159 --> 33:08.484
to be your 72nd Youth Governor.

33:08.535 --> 33:09.987
[cheering]

33:10.038 --> 33:13.656
Last conference, we affirmed
the following plank.

33:13.707 --> 33:14.908
The Redwood Party believes

33:14.959 --> 33:17.577
in increasing funding
for education.

33:17.628 --> 33:18.536
Will you stand with me

33:18.587 --> 33:20.873
in increasing funding
for civic education?

33:20.924 --> 33:23.332
- [cheering]
- Yes!

33:23.383 --> 33:24.292
Will you stand with me

33:24.343 --> 33:26.252
in providing more opportunities

33:26.303 --> 33:27.628
for lower-income delegates?

33:27.679 --> 33:29.089
- [cheering]
- Yes!

33:29.140 --> 33:31.507
Then I ask you, please,

33:31.558 --> 33:32.592
vote Tate for a great state,

33:32.643 --> 33:34.887
and even if I don't make it
to the next stage,

33:34.938 --> 33:37.181
I ask every one of you,
use your privilege

33:37.232 --> 33:40.641
to change the world
for the better. Thank you.

33:40.692 --> 33:43.686
[cheering]

33:43.737 --> 33:46.490
Thank you so much, Tate.

WINSTON:
<i>As the election goes on,</i>

33:55.374 --> 33:58.576
<i>all eyes turn
to those six candidates,</i>

33:58.627 --> 34:01.579
<i>whose profiles
have really been elevated.</i>

34:01.630 --> 34:03.748
There's a jump that happens
when you're here.

34:03.799 --> 34:05.750
They're literally
standing on corners,

34:05.801 --> 34:07.418
saying, "Hey,
will you vote for me?

34:07.469 --> 34:08.962
This is why.
This is who I am."

34:09.013 --> 34:11.131
Elevator speeches,
the whole bit.

34:11.182 --> 34:13.633
<i>And you're constantly thinking</i>

34:13.684 --> 34:17.262
<i>about how you can
resonate effectively</i>

34:17.313 --> 34:18.222
<i>with an audience.</i>

34:18.273 --> 34:19.223
My name is Aidan Blain,

34:19.274 --> 34:20.806
and I'm running
with the Avocado Party

34:20.857 --> 34:23.018
to serve as your
72nd Youth Governor.

34:23.069 --> 34:25.187
- [cheering]
- Yeah, let's go! Right?

34:25.238 --> 34:27.522
WINSTON: You don't know
if you're gonna win.

34:27.573 --> 34:30.316
<i>You're always sort of
wrestling with a public</i>

34:30.367 --> 34:32.401
<i>that may or may not like you,</i>

34:32.452 --> 34:35.404
<i>and you've gotta
be okay with that.</i>

34:35.455 --> 34:37.282
Our state has allowed education

34:37.333 --> 34:39.492
to take a back seat
as a priority.

34:39.543 --> 34:41.410
Why do these problems exist?

34:41.461 --> 34:43.371
Two words, property tax.

34:43.422 --> 34:44.998
WINSTON:<i>You're saying
that in choosing</i>

34:45.049 --> 34:48.751
<i>to be a candidate, I am
somehow better than others.</i>

34:48.802 --> 34:50.963
<i>On the other hand,
the best leaders,</i>

34:51.014 --> 34:55.800
<i>run for office because they
truly want to serve others.</i>

34:55.851 --> 34:59.637
Our politicians care more
about parties than people.

34:59.688 --> 35:02.557
They care more about seats
than citizens.

35:02.608 --> 35:04.392
The United States
currently holds

35:04.443 --> 35:05.518
1/4 of the world's prisoners,

35:05.569 --> 35:07.812
and this is supposed to be
the land of the free.

35:07.863 --> 35:10.815
Every kid deserves a future.

35:10.866 --> 35:12.733
WINSTON: Maybe it's
something intangible

35:12.784 --> 35:16.904
<i>that leads people
to put that one candidate</i>

35:16.956 --> 35:18.115
<i>over the top.</i>

35:18.166 --> 35:20.117
BOY: All right,
who's gonna win governor?

35:20.168 --> 35:20.700
Solomon.

35:20.751 --> 35:21.867
- Or Beyo.
- No, no, no! Beyo!

35:21.918 --> 35:23.328
- Beyo!
- Beyo. Oh, my God. We agree.

35:23.379 --> 35:24.246
Wait, no, it's Bayo.

35:24.297 --> 35:25.247
- Piper.
- Piper.

35:25.298 --> 35:26.914
- Piper.
- I'm voting for Piper.

35:26.966 --> 35:27.832
I really like Tate.

35:27.883 --> 35:29.167
He had really good diction.

35:29.218 --> 35:31.419
In between Aidan Blain
and Piper.

35:31.470 --> 35:33.255
- Just vote for Alex Goldbeck.
- Right here.

35:33.306 --> 35:36.382
I don't agree with basically
anyone's policies in here,

35:36.433 --> 35:37.342
'cause I'm a Libertarian.

35:37.393 --> 35:38.884
The candidate
with the pink suit.

35:38.935 --> 35:41.179
Be comfortable
with the uncomfortable.

35:41.230 --> 35:43.389
Let's fight for
the issues that matter most,

35:43.440 --> 35:45.100
even when they
bring us discomfort.

35:45.151 --> 35:49.729
Whatever it is, make it happen.

35:49.780 --> 35:51.231
WINSTON:<i>It's not enough
to want it most.</i>

35:51.282 --> 35:53.233
<i>It's not enough
to be the smartest,</i>

35:53.284 --> 35:55.735
<i>and it's not enough
to be the most well-liked.</i>

35:55.786 --> 35:59.864
<i>At the end of the day,
it's the leap of faith.</i>

35:59.915 --> 36:02.408
- My name is Solomon Kim.
- My name is Alex Goldbeck.

36:02.459 --> 36:04.161
Bayo Collins from the Greater
Long Beach delegation.

36:04.212 --> 36:05.870
Piper Samuels from
the Culver-Palms Family...

OIEN: I've been waiting
to run for governor

36:29.903 --> 36:32.281
<i>since my freshman year.</i>

36:32.572 --> 36:36.285
<i>I have just been
preparing for this moment.</i>

36:36.868 --> 36:38.569
<i>But, you know, it's politics.
You don't know</i>

<i>what's gonna resonate

36:41.082 --> 36:41.906
<i>You don't know</i>

36:51.007 --> 36:53.459
<i>for the program,
convince them that...</i>

36:53.510 --> 36:54.835
<i>That my vision for the program</i>

36:54.886 --> 36:57.672
<i>was actually achievable,

37:03.438 --> 37:05.012
We are number one!

37:22.831 --> 37:25.783
that will be running

38:00.453 --> 38:03.696
Piper Samuels from

It's all good. It's all good.

38:57.884 --> 39:00.337
Candidates, please come onstage.

39:00.388 --> 39:02.557

BLAIN: I think Prefontaine
is a conflicted role model

39:34.505 --> 39:36.673
<i>for all runners.</i>

39:37.216 --> 39:40.502
<i>His mentality of
"I'm gonna do it...</i>

39:40.553 --> 39:41.836
<i>whether or not it hurts,"</i>

39:41.887 --> 39:43.712
<i>it's a very hard
mentality to have,</i>

39:43.763 --> 39:45.631
<i>because when you go out
and it's painful</i>

39:45.682 --> 39:50.470
<i>and you wanna stop,
it's not fun.</i>

39:50.521 --> 39:53.482
<i>But he did it every race.</i>

39:55.568 --> 39:56.642
<i>A lot of people just say,</i>

39:56.693 --> 39:58.520
<i>"Oh, I'm not a politics person,"</i>

39:58.571 --> 39:59.354
<i>but in the end,</i>

39:59.405 --> 40:00.771
<i>everyone's a politics person,</i>

40:00.822 --> 40:02.731
<i>because politics
affects everyone.</i>

40:02.782 --> 40:06.110
<i>My dream was always being
a Stanford-recruited athlete</i>

40:06.161 --> 40:07.571
<i>and going to college for that,</i>

<i>but this opportunity
to... to run a campaign</i>

40:10.081 --> 40:12.741
<i>for youth governor
definitely opened my eyes,</i>

40:12.792 --> 40:15.495
<i>and it kind of showed me
what politics is.</i>

40:15.546 --> 40:18.415
<i>There were nights that I was
having arguments with my dad</i>

40:18.466 --> 40:20.375
<i>over why I didn't want
to do track anymore.</i>

40:20.426 --> 40:22.627
<i>He's a huge politics guy,

40:22.678 --> 40:24.254
<i>that I was running
for youth governor,</i>

40:27.223 --> 40:29.216
<i>a lot of my life on it,</i>

40:29.268 --> 40:32.720
<i>and he wanted me to focus
a little bit more on track.</i>

40:32.771 --> 40:33.679
<i>I kind of realized</i>

40:33.730 --> 40:36.015
<i>that I don't wanna
do track as much anymore,</i>

40:36.066 --> 40:39.778
<i>so I'm pretty much
just focusing on Y&G.</i>

40:47.662 --> 40:48.944
How was it being
by yourself, though,

40:48.995 --> 40:52.282
for the first time? 'Cause I
was there last time, so...

40:52.333 --> 40:53.073
I know. Yeah.

40:53.124 --> 40:55.368
I had, like, so much
other responsibilities

40:55.419 --> 40:57.036
that, like,
even you being there,

40:57.087 --> 40:58.455
I wouldn't have
seen you that much.

40:58.506 --> 41:01.291
I was always moving.
Like, literally like...

41:01.342 --> 41:03.501
I was getting pulled
in a million directions.

41:03.552 --> 41:06.170
Somebody always asking me
to do this, post this,

41:06.221 --> 41:07.880
endorse this,
show up to this meeting.

41:07.931 --> 41:11.468
No free time, 'cause I have
to go to all these caucuses

41:11.519 --> 41:13.761
and... Oh, I made...
I made a way, though.

41:13.812 --> 41:16.138
You know how I am.
I will find a way.

41:16.189 --> 41:17.056
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

41:17.107 --> 41:18.391
Even Piper and Aidan
got to the point

41:18.442 --> 41:20.100
where they were tired.
They were... They were dogged.

41:20.151 --> 41:21.478
You realize
how much goes into it,

41:21.529 --> 41:23.355
- like, to just be, like, you.
- I didn't know how...

41:23.406 --> 41:24.772
Like, it really
takes a lot, though.

41:24.823 --> 41:26.231
I always thought
that the governor's race...

41:26.282 --> 41:28.817
The reason I didn't do it, I
was like, it's just too much.

41:28.868 --> 41:30.027
- It's no joke, bro.
- Yeah.

41:30.078 --> 41:31.737
BAYO: Making top three is
an accomplishment in itself.

41:31.788 --> 41:34.031
- People respect that.
- Just making it to a...

41:34.082 --> 41:36.576
Just owning a party
is an accomplishment.

41:36.627 --> 41:37.910
Just making it
out of your party,

41:37.961 --> 41:39.161
like, 'cause even that is rough.

41:39.212 --> 41:40.788
I wish I was there
this year, though.

41:40.839 --> 41:42.415
I wish that, like, I had done

41:42.466 --> 41:43.625
what I did last year this year

41:43.676 --> 41:45.042
so I could watch you,
'cause, like,

41:45.093 --> 41:46.961
last year, I was kind of... ran
media, and we would have been

41:47.012 --> 41:48.505
all in the governor's role
and everything,

41:48.556 --> 41:50.130
so I would have been,
like, interviewing you.

41:50.181 --> 41:51.591
I-I'd have pressed you,
made you crack

41:51.642 --> 41:53.050
under the pressure
and stuff like that.

41:53.101 --> 41:55.345
But, you know,
you lucky this year.

41:55.396 --> 41:56.804
How's things
been at home, though,

41:56.855 --> 41:58.263
like, since I been gone?

41:58.314 --> 41:59.848
It's bor... It's like...

41:59.899 --> 42:00.849
I'm on my phone more,

42:00.900 --> 42:04.655
'cause I don't have,
like somebody to talk to.

42:04.739 --> 42:05.771
Which is, like... not, like...

42:05.822 --> 42:08.190
It's like by default.
I'm just on my phone more,

42:08.241 --> 42:09.442
'cause I don't have a friend...

42:09.493 --> 42:10.943
- Right.
- At home.

42:10.994 --> 42:12.529
Or a brother or friend.

42:12.580 --> 42:14.989
So... But I gotten used to it.

42:15.040 --> 42:16.949
Like, I'm not, like,
sad or anything. I'm cool.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.283
I just... It just took
a little bit

42:18.334 --> 42:20.035
of getting used to
in the beginning,

42:20.086 --> 42:22.329
but now I'm like...

42:22.381 --> 42:23.998
used to it.

42:24.049 --> 42:25.833
But that day
when we dropped you off,

42:25.884 --> 42:29.262
that day, I was like,
"Aw, man. I..."

42:30.013 --> 42:30.921
It's, like, really like...

42:30.972 --> 42:33.383
We drove off.
I was like, "Aw, man."

42:33.434 --> 42:35.300
It still feels weird, man.

42:35.351 --> 42:38.313
[music playing]

42:47.113 --> 42:49.492
[music only continues]

42:53.788 --> 42:55.195
Yeah.

42:55.246 --> 42:56.573
Now a picture file.

42:56.624 --> 42:58.700
Picture. Okay.
Need a picture.

42:58.751 --> 42:59.743
- Bayo.
- All right.

42:59.794 --> 43:02.662
Little sister is proud
of her brother.

43:02.713 --> 43:03.370
All right.

43:03.422 --> 43:04.706
- You take it?
- Yes.

43:04.757 --> 43:07.875
- Pushed the video.
- Aw, that's the wrong button.

43:07.926 --> 43:09.470
This one.

43:09.928 --> 43:12.714
BAYO: My first year,
my mom wanted me to do it,

43:12.765 --> 43:14.131
<i>but I was just like, "Nah."</i>

43:14.182 --> 43:16.842
<i>Like, who is trying,
to, like, go dress up</i>

43:16.893 --> 43:18.678
<i>in a suit and do
this government stuff?</i>

43:18.729 --> 43:21.732
<i>Like, what does that even mean?</i>

43:21.940 --> 43:22.890
<i>But it wasn't an option.</i>

43:22.941 --> 43:24.684
<i>She was like,
"Yeah, you're doing it,"</i>

43:24.735 --> 43:26.686
<i>so I was like, "All right."</i>

43:26.737 --> 43:27.853
<i>So I go to my first meeting,</i>

43:27.904 --> 43:30.022
<i>and that kind of, like,
got me more motivated.</i>

43:30.073 --> 43:32.442
<i>I was like,
"All right, cool."</i>

43:32.493 --> 43:36.070
<i>At first, I wasn't
a super political person</i>

43:36.121 --> 43:37.614
<i>like the other kids.</i>

43:37.665 --> 43:39.865
<i>Like the way I watch
</i> ESPN First Take

43:39.916 --> 43:41.366
<i>is how they're watching
the debates.</i>

43:41.417 --> 43:42.868
<i>They're all into it,
like, "Oh, man,</i>

43:42.919 --> 43:45.370
<i>like Cory Booker
and Kamala Harris."</i>

43:45.421 --> 43:47.749
<i>I'm like, uh, like,
"Max Kellerman, Stephen A."</i>

43:47.800 --> 43:49.459
<i>Like, I don't know
what's going on.</i>

43:49.510 --> 43:53.212
<i>But I realized
I have another talent,</i>

43:53.263 --> 43:55.923
<i>something else I'm good at.</i>

43:55.974 --> 43:57.883
<i>My full middle name is Adebayo.</i>

43:57.934 --> 43:59.259
I switched to Austin
in middle school,

43:59.310 --> 44:02.096
'cause people kept
mispronouncing my middle name,

44:02.147 --> 44:03.013
so yeah. So that's...

44:03.064 --> 44:04.641
I'm more comfortable
with my middle name.

44:04.692 --> 44:05.974
That's why I decided to go back,

44:06.025 --> 44:08.185
'cause I don't care
what people say anymore,

44:08.236 --> 44:09.353
so, you know, it's fine.

44:09.404 --> 44:10.814
<i>Anyone that knows me,</i>

44:10.865 --> 44:11.815
<i>they know I'm Nigerian.</i>

44:11.866 --> 44:13.315
<i>People that know me
more personally</i>

44:13.366 --> 44:14.441
<i>know I used to live there.</i>

44:14.493 --> 44:16.443
<i>It's something
I, like, value a lot.</i>

44:16.495 --> 44:18.904
<i>I don't shy away from it at all.</i>

44:18.955 --> 44:21.491
This we just call,
like, the native outfit.

44:21.542 --> 44:24.118
The Yoruba tribe is my dad.
Yoruba.

44:24.169 --> 44:25.160
That's what... My dad speaks

44:25.211 --> 44:26.830
that language, too,
as well as English.

44:26.881 --> 44:28.665
So this is the top.
It's like a shirt,

44:28.716 --> 44:32.544
like a longer shirt, and then
the pants are in here.

44:32.595 --> 44:34.796
The suit right here,

44:34.847 --> 44:37.757
I got this the other day,

44:37.808 --> 44:38.758
and I'm gonna wear this

44:38.809 --> 44:40.175
on the Governor's Ball
in Sacramento,

44:40.226 --> 44:43.980
'cause you want to have
something a little bit nicer.

44:45.982 --> 44:48.475
<i>I've heard people say
that all three candidates</i>

44:48.527 --> 44:50.269
<i>are very different
from each other.</i>

44:50.320 --> 44:51.521
<i>Aidan is really popular.</i>

44:51.572 --> 44:53.105
<i>He has a way of,
like, saying stuff</i>

44:53.156 --> 44:54.607
<i>that a lot of people
latch on to,</i>

44:54.658 --> 44:59.236
<i>and he says it in a way that
gets people real riled up.</i>

44:59.287 --> 45:02.114
<i>Piper, she's
real into the numbers</i>

45:02.165 --> 45:03.115
<i>and the facts and, like,</i>

45:03.166 --> 45:04.784
<i>she knows exactly
what she wants to do,</i>

45:04.835 --> 45:09.673
<i>how she wants to do it,
has a plan set in place.</i>

45:11.466 --> 45:14.084
<i>What drives me is to win.</i>

45:14.135 --> 45:15.712
<i>I see myself on the screen</i>

45:15.763 --> 45:18.590
<i>and then the votes
going in my way,</i>

45:18.641 --> 45:21.425
<i>and then I go up there,
get the big gavel.</i>

45:21.476 --> 45:22.594
<i>Scott's gonna hand it to me,</i>

45:22.645 --> 45:25.438
<i>and it's gonna
be over after that.</i>

45:32.237 --> 45:33.312
SAMUELS:<i>Running as a woman</i>

45:33.363 --> 45:36.324
<i>is different
than running as a man.</i>

45:36.491 --> 45:37.942
<i>Like, if I went into the mike,</i>

45:37.993 --> 45:41.361
<i>like, yelling and, like,
being super confident</i>

45:41.412 --> 45:43.238
<i>and, you know, like,
super, like, swaggy,</i>

45:43.289 --> 45:45.324
<i>I feel like people just
think that... I don't know.</i>

45:45.375 --> 45:48.368
<i>It would give off
a completely different vibe.</i>

45:48.419 --> 45:50.037
<i>Female candidates
have done that before,</i>

45:50.088 --> 45:52.247
<i>and they haven't gotten
the same amount of,</i>

45:52.298 --> 45:53.415
<i>like, praise and respect</i>

45:53.466 --> 45:56.628
<i>that Aidan is getting this year.</i>

45:56.679 --> 45:58.045
<i>But now that there's</i>

45:58.096 --> 46:00.380
<i>only three of us
in the top three,</i>

46:00.431 --> 46:04.477
<i>it's definitely,
like, super stressful.</i>

46:04.895 --> 46:06.136
I just hope that, like,

46:06.187 --> 46:08.096
the adrenaline stays with me
for long enough,

46:08.147 --> 46:10.600
'cause it's a much longer
conference than the last two.

46:10.651 --> 46:12.392
<i>And now that there's
only three of us,</i>

46:12.443 --> 46:14.646
<i>everyone knows who we are
at this point, you know,</i>

46:14.697 --> 46:17.022
<i>and everyone's like,
"Oh, one of these people</i>

46:17.073 --> 46:20.201
<i>is gonna be the governor
next year."</i>

46:20.576 --> 46:22.402
MOTHER: Yay. Dad's home.

46:22.453 --> 46:24.039
Hello.

46:26.124 --> 46:28.826
PIPER: I think I kind of
have to talk about the...

46:28.877 --> 46:32.204
like, Trout Party stuff
and unity stuff.

46:32.255 --> 46:33.665
Like, I have...
You know, it's like

46:33.716 --> 46:34.916
the elephant in the room,
you know?

46:34.967 --> 46:39.763
How much of the Trout Party
do you think supports you?

46:40.471 --> 46:41.839
I don't know.

46:41.890 --> 46:43.548
[laughs] I don't know.

46:43.599 --> 46:45.509
A lot of them, I think...

46:45.560 --> 46:48.638
were not super into me running.

46:48.689 --> 46:50.555
Um, I wasn't, like,
exactly showing

46:50.606 --> 46:53.517
the most, like, Trout pride
throughout the conference.

46:53.568 --> 46:55.227
But mainly I was just
kind of trying to be...

46:55.278 --> 46:58.105
Like, emphasized that I
was still on their side

46:58.156 --> 47:00.148
and I might not agree with them,

47:00.199 --> 47:01.693
but I still support them.

47:01.744 --> 47:04.495
[music playing]

47:05.080 --> 47:07.031
<i>I'm the only one
who had this experience.</i>

47:07.082 --> 47:08.866
<i>None of the other
candidates did.</i>

47:08.917 --> 47:14.496
<i>But I think it teaches you
a lot about your ideology</i>

47:14.547 --> 47:16.206
<i>when you're facing opposition</i>

47:16.257 --> 47:19.635
<i>from people you disagree with.</i>

47:20.929 --> 47:22.337
<i>I think it would be beneficial</i>

47:22.388 --> 47:25.883
<i>if all politicians spent
a day in the other party,</i>

47:25.934 --> 47:28.593
<i>trying to appeal
to other audiences,</i>

47:28.644 --> 47:32.015
<i>because this whole system
of labels</i>

47:32.066 --> 47:36.393
<i>and politics and parties
isn't perfect.</i>

47:36.444 --> 47:39.313
<i>And I think a lot of people
feel that way about politics,</i>

47:39.364 --> 47:40.439
<i>that their political label</i>

47:40.490 --> 47:41.941
<i>doesn't perfectly identify them</i>

47:41.992 --> 47:43.525
<i>and if they could
explain everything</i>

47:43.576 --> 47:47.163
<i>to everyone they came across,
they would.</i>

47:47.790 --> 47:49.741
<i>I had all these issues
in politics</i>

47:49.792 --> 47:50.742
<i>that I cared about,</i>

47:50.793 --> 47:52.659
<i>and I just thought
it was admirable</i>

47:52.711 --> 47:54.119
<i>that someone would get up there</i>

47:54.170 --> 47:56.496
<i>and, like, put everything
on the table</i>

47:56.547 --> 47:58.373
<i>for what they believe in.</i>

47:58.424 --> 48:01.044
<i>Because it seems like candidates</i>

48:01.095 --> 48:04.756
<i>are so confident
and are so powerful,</i>

48:04.807 --> 48:06.256
<i>and everyone knows who they are.</i>

48:06.307 --> 48:08.968
<i>But really it's this
incredibly vulnerable thing,</i>

48:09.019 --> 48:11.261
<i>because you're leaving
your fate into the hands</i>

48:11.312 --> 48:14.057
<i>of a bunch of people
you don't know.</i>

[music playing]

48:33.459 --> 48:36.171
[crowd murmuring]

48:50.726 --> 48:52.929
I would like to call
this joint session

48:52.980 --> 48:56.891
of the 71st California
YMCA Youth & Government

48:56.942 --> 48:59.643

<i>I love the energy.</i>

49:06.659 --> 49:08.360
<i>I love the enthusiasm.
I love the sense</i>

49:08.411 --> 49:10.863
<i>of idealism
and hopefulness that...</i>

49:10.914 --> 49:12.489
- [cheering]
- You're hearing

49:12.540 --> 49:13.698
the cheers behind me.

49:13.749 --> 49:14.574
I love it. I was...

49:14.625 --> 49:16.368
Scott came in,
and he starts grilling me

49:16.419 --> 49:19.579
on all the water issues
and high-speed-rail issues,

49:19.630 --> 49:21.665
prison-reform issues,
and we laid out

49:21.716 --> 49:23.625
a lot of the conundrums
of governing.

49:23.676 --> 49:28.463
And it restores a sense
of calm and comfort

49:28.514 --> 49:29.714
and, uh, optimism,

49:29.765 --> 49:32.969
that despite all
the white water of the moment,

49:33.020 --> 49:34.971
on every side
of the political aisle

49:35.022 --> 49:36.346
in every part of this country,

49:36.397 --> 49:37.764
that, uh, there are
folks out there

49:37.816 --> 49:40.600
that still believe
and still have faith.

DARRELL STEINBERG:
Good morning, YMCA

49:42.988 --> 49:44.312
Youth & Government delegates.

49:44.363 --> 49:47.900
What an honor it is for me
to welcome you here

to the capital city.

49:50.078 --> 49:51.611
Now your next speaker...

49:51.662 --> 49:56.159
my friend, the great governor
of the state of California,

49:56.210 --> 49:57.827
Gavin Newsom!

49:57.878 --> 50:00.755
[cheering]

50:06.344 --> 50:07.627
Morning, everybody.

50:07.678 --> 50:09.713
[cheering]

50:09.764 --> 50:12.600
It's nice to see you all.

50:13.143 --> 50:16.012
I think one of
the most stressful things

50:16.063 --> 50:18.638
about being your age

50:18.689 --> 50:23.310
is that we're so damn
competitive with each other.

50:23.361 --> 50:23.978
Right?

50:24.029 --> 50:26.939
And that's hard,
'cause we live in a society

50:26.990 --> 50:29.649
where we're constantly,
you know,

50:29.700 --> 50:31.610
sizing each other up.

50:31.661 --> 50:34.238
But I promise you this.

50:34.289 --> 50:36.991
What the world
is so desperate for

50:37.042 --> 50:40.744
is for you to discover
your own talents,

50:40.795 --> 50:43.663
not to try to mimic
someone else's.

50:43.714 --> 50:47.718
We are desperate for leaders.

50:48.929 --> 50:50.004
<i>But here's the good news.</i>

50:50.055 --> 50:53.132
<i>Leaders can be found
anywhere and everywhere.</i>

50:53.183 --> 50:56.343
And I'm honored and proud
of each and every one of you

50:56.394 --> 51:00.388
that demonstrably have led.
Keep up the good work.

51:00.439 --> 51:01.389
You gotta manifest it,

51:01.440 --> 51:04.309
and I'm looking forward
to what you do

51:04.360 --> 51:05.393
for years and years to come.

51:05.444 --> 51:10.107
Thank you, all of you,
for your incredible work.

51:10.158 --> 51:12.785

51:25.257 --> 51:26.290
Hello. Hey, Jan...

51:26.341 --> 51:27.499
No, text the Leg-Ans.

51:27.550 --> 51:31.679
Make sure that they're
ready for 4:15.

51:32.680 --> 51:35.632
Real pressing need
and a real human crisis

51:35.683 --> 51:38.510
is impacting the lives
of millions and millions

51:38.561 --> 51:41.305
of Americans that demand
and deserve better.

51:41.356 --> 51:42.889
I don't want to be
a sparring partner

51:42.941 --> 51:44.808
with President Trump. We want
to be a working partner.

51:44.859 --> 51:49.646
But we have no other choice
than to sue the administration,

51:49.697 --> 51:50.605
join other states,

51:50.656 --> 51:52.108
join our partners
in the federal government

51:52.159 --> 51:54.318
- to do the same...
- for incredible bills

51:54.369 --> 51:55.402
that I still believe in,

51:55.453 --> 51:58.030
and I believe that they
were amazing options.

51:58.081 --> 51:59.031
Um, I believe that now,

51:59.082 --> 52:00.740
as the House sessions are going,

52:00.791 --> 52:03.077
we may have had one or two more

52:03.128 --> 52:04.328
that haven't passed through.

52:04.379 --> 52:05.662
Unfortunately those didn't pass,

52:05.713 --> 52:06.705
but they're amazing ideas,

52:06.756 --> 52:08.124
and I hope that
those bill sponsors

52:08.175 --> 52:10.834
continue to perpetuate those
ideas in their everyday life.

52:10.885 --> 52:13.087
BLAIN: So I think
that our number one concern

52:13.138 --> 52:15.797
as Californians should be
decreasing our deficit.

52:15.848 --> 52:19.593
I-I think that spending
our money in a wasteful way

52:19.644 --> 52:20.552
is never a good idea,

52:20.603 --> 52:24.565
and I think that especially
in a country... in a state...

52:25.650 --> 52:26.976
I think that
a really important...

52:27.027 --> 52:29.228
SAMUELS:
<i>There's never a break.</i>

52:29.279 --> 52:30.604
<i>You're always on.</i>

52:30.655 --> 52:32.148
<i>There's, like,
one thing after another.</i>

52:32.199 --> 52:34.233
Like, right after this,
I have to, like, rush over

52:34.284 --> 52:36.027
to Forum to talk
to all the freshmen,

52:36.078 --> 52:37.777
and then, like, I don't
have anything written down,

52:37.828 --> 52:40.156
so we're gonna have to, like,
write some notes on the way.

52:40.207 --> 52:41.906
You know, it's like...
It's, like, so busy.

52:41.957 --> 52:44.919
<i>Everything's happening at once.</i>

52:45.003 --> 52:46.453
<i>There's gonna be
a lot of campaigning</i>

52:46.504 --> 52:50.582
<i>or just, like, grinding
as the campaign proceeds.</i>

52:50.633 --> 52:52.209
<i>I'm trying to keep,
like, a cool head.</i>

52:52.260 --> 52:56.588
<i>But it's much more cutthroat
than it used to be.</i>

52:56.639 --> 52:59.558
[music playing]

53:09.444 --> 53:12.114
[cheering rises]

53:14.032 --> 53:15.815
Hello, Y&G.

53:15.866 --> 53:17.026
My name is Piper Samuels

53:17.077 --> 53:19.694
from the Culver-Palms
Family YMCA...

53:19.745 --> 53:21.030
[together] C.P.Y.!

53:21.081 --> 53:23.615
And I'm running with
the Trout and Redwood Parties

53:23.666 --> 53:26.785
to serve as your
72nd Youth Governor.

53:26.836 --> 53:29.163
Recognizing and
accepting differences

53:29.214 --> 53:30.206
does not divide us...

53:30.257 --> 53:32.666
CLARK:<i>I am happy
that Piper got this far.</i>

53:32.717 --> 53:36.212
I feel that our leadership
is left-wing,

53:36.263 --> 53:38.381
which I feel like is okay,

53:38.432 --> 53:39.506
but we have executive teams

53:39.557 --> 53:41.549
that don't know
what the people want,

53:41.600 --> 53:42.509
and at the same time,

53:42.560 --> 53:45.553
we have radicals that are
eating us up on the inside.

53:45.604 --> 53:48.640
So it's kind of like
the Trout Party

53:48.691 --> 53:50.226
is going to explode,

53:50.277 --> 53:51.143
but we can't explode

53:51.194 --> 53:54.655
if we want to continue
being the Trout Party.

53:55.073 --> 53:56.232
<i>I think my policy team,</i>

53:56.283 --> 53:57.941
<i>we've done
an incredibly good job</i>

53:57.992 --> 53:59.859
<i>making sure
that the radical right</i>

53:59.910 --> 54:02.696
<i>does not assert
their propaganda beliefs</i>

54:02.747 --> 54:03.697
<i>throughout all of Trout</i>

54:03.748 --> 54:07.710
<i>and jeopardize
everything we stand for.</i>

54:08.544 --> 54:10.121
[music playing]

54:10.172 --> 54:11.913
The word I used
is like an arms race,

54:11.964 --> 54:13.332
where you have, like,
one candidate

54:13.383 --> 54:15.292
will do, like, this thing,
and then the other candidates

54:15.343 --> 54:16.710
are like, "Wait,
I wanna do that thing."

54:16.761 --> 54:18.045
Everyone's trying
to get the leg up,

54:18.096 --> 54:22.341
and then everyone else is like,
"I didn't get that leg up,

54:22.392 --> 54:23.508
and I want that now."

54:23.559 --> 54:25.760
Yeah, and 'cause what people
are gonna start doing now

54:25.811 --> 54:27.263
is, since it's down
to three candidates,

54:27.314 --> 54:28.888
they're gonna be
comparing us very closely.

54:28.939 --> 54:30.014
What does this candidate offer

54:30.065 --> 54:31.392
that this candidate
doesn't offer?

54:31.443 --> 54:33.017
So if we can show,
"Listen, like..." not saying

54:33.068 --> 54:34.644
any other candidates,
like, are less than us,

54:34.695 --> 54:37.148
but if we can show them
how amazing our platform is

54:37.199 --> 54:39.524
and show them why, like,
as youth governor,

54:39.575 --> 54:41.526
I will do the most
for the program

54:41.577 --> 54:42.861
and, like,
kind of showcase that,

54:42.912 --> 54:44.571
I think that's what's
gonna appeal to people.

54:44.622 --> 54:46.282
Also I think that...
I don't know if you guys

54:46.333 --> 54:48.242
saw the poster over there
with Piper's platform on it,

54:48.293 --> 54:49.784
It has, like,
five parts of the platform.

54:49.835 --> 54:51.328
<i>It's gonna be
a little bit dirty,</i>

54:51.379 --> 54:53.164
<i>but I think that we should
put my platform on it,</i>

54:53.215 --> 54:54.831
<i>my face on it,
put it right next to hers.</i>

54:54.882 --> 54:57.501
<i>I want people to, like,
know the platform.</i>

54:57.552 --> 55:00.296
We really only need to
impress Grizzly and Redwood.

55:00.347 --> 55:03.089
I really... I do not care
what Gold thinks about me,

55:03.141 --> 55:04.467
do not care what Trout
thinks about me.

55:04.518 --> 55:06.177
I do care
what Poppy thinks about me,

55:06.228 --> 55:09.021
but we've already
kind of established that.

55:09.104 --> 55:11.765
<i>In between T&E 2 and Sacramento,</i>

55:11.816 --> 55:12.974
<i>I was helping Poppy Party</i>

55:13.025 --> 55:15.977
<i>grant which governor
they would like to endorse,</i>

55:16.028 --> 55:16.978
<i>and we picked Aidan.</i>

55:17.029 --> 55:19.190
But nothing's really stable,
I guess you would say,

55:19.241 --> 55:22.234
because we could hear
a quote from Bayo

55:22.285 --> 55:26.571
and be, like, "Wait.
That supports us so much more

55:26.622 --> 55:27.697
than what Aidan's quote was,"

55:27.748 --> 55:31.785
and could start, you know,
flipping, who we endorse.

55:31.836 --> 55:33.537
<i>Everyone's just trying 24/7</i>

55:33.588 --> 55:37.384
<i>to make sure that
their candidate wins.</i>

55:39.009 --> 55:40.377
I'm running for youth governor,

55:40.428 --> 55:43.339
because I know I'm a part
of something truly great.

55:43.390 --> 55:45.466
This program will be
more inclusive next year,

55:45.517 --> 55:47.801
because I'm going to make
immediate, feasible changes

55:47.852 --> 55:50.929
to ensure that this program
is as life-changing for you

55:50.980 --> 55:52.389
as it has been for me.

55:52.440 --> 55:53.723
[cheering]

55:53.774 --> 55:56.100
And having any time
to just taking it all in

55:56.151 --> 55:58.686
and just enjoying
my hard work pay off

55:58.737 --> 56:02.658
to some extent, 'cause
obviously I want to win.

56:03.326 --> 56:05.077
<i>But...</i>

56:05.786 --> 56:07.581
<i>it got bad...</i>

56:08.080 --> 56:09.989
<i>like, so fast.</i>

56:10.040 --> 56:12.033
<i>We had, like, two days
where I was like,</i>

56:12.084 --> 56:13.202
<i>yeah, we were looking good.</i>

56:13.253 --> 56:15.036
<i>And then I'm doing
the interviews</i>

56:15.087 --> 56:16.455
<i>with all the political parties,</i>

56:16.506 --> 56:17.622
<i>like, going around the room.</i>

56:17.673 --> 56:19.542
<i>And I get to, like,
one of the last ones,</i>

56:19.593 --> 56:21.293
<i>and they're like,
"Hey, we just wanna, like,</i>

56:21.344 --> 56:23.127
<i>let you know. Like, do you
know about the video?"</i>

56:23.178 --> 56:25.339
<i>And I was like, "What video
are you talking about?"</i>

56:25.390 --> 56:28.800
<i>And they're like, "Yeah.
Like, your... your video."</i>

56:28.851 --> 56:33.305
I'm Bayo Collins, and this is
my CONA application for 2019.

56:33.356 --> 56:35.682
I'm in favor
of Betsy DeVos' revisions

56:35.733 --> 56:38.561
to the Title IX Act,
because it allows schools

56:38.612 --> 56:39.520
to require more proof

56:39.571 --> 56:41.980
when students are being
accused of sexual assault.

56:42.031 --> 56:44.858
It makes it tougher to find
accused students guilty

56:44.909 --> 56:48.069
by narrowing the definition
of sexual harassment

56:48.120 --> 56:49.904
to the most severe acts.

56:49.955 --> 56:52.366
Schools would only be
held accountable

56:52.417 --> 56:53.325
for formal complaints

56:53.376 --> 56:57.380
and conduct
that happened on campus...

You know, said that, like,
this was a big problem,

57:04.219 --> 57:06.045
that we needed to deal with it.

57:06.096 --> 57:08.465
COLLINS: I don't think
it's a normal thing

57:08.516 --> 57:09.592

application videos.</i>

57:18.108 --> 57:19.643
<i>Maybe I didn't do
my due diligence,</i>

57:19.694 --> 57:21.978
<i>but what I read,
it seemed like Betsy DeVos,</i>

57:22.029 --> 57:23.104
<i>what her revisions were...</i>

57:23.155 --> 57:25.524
<i>And her intentions
were to help everyone</i>

57:25.575 --> 57:28.234
<i>and to just make
the whole reporting process</i>

from what she said,</i>

<i>and I said that's,
you know, what I stand for,</i>

57:36.628 --> 57:39.746
<i>because what I interpreted
from what she said</i>

57:39.797 --> 57:41.373
<i>was that it's to help people.</i>

everything I worked for

is, like, going downhill,
you know, real fast.

58:28.471 --> 58:30.547
Running for youth governor
is a place

so much attack and heat.

someone said I was stupid,

someone said that I didn't
know what I was talking about,

58:40.483 --> 58:42.100
someone said that I
was a bad candidate,

58:42.151 --> 58:44.687
that I was made fun of my...
For my height,

58:44.738 --> 58:45.646
for the way that I spoke.

58:45.697 --> 58:47.731
People said that my speeches
were prewritten

58:47.782 --> 58:48.856
and that I didn't write them.

58:48.907 --> 58:50.359
People called me Broccoli Head.

58:50.410 --> 58:51.317
People called me thot.

58:51.369 --> 58:54.237
People made fun of me.
People made memes about me.

58:54.288 --> 58:55.196
- Mm-hmm.
- You know.

58:55.247 --> 58:56.490
I didn't get any endorsements.

58:56.541 --> 58:57.824
Yeah, Bella always told me that.

58:57.875 --> 58:59.368
I didn't get absolutely
any endorsements.

58:59.419 --> 59:00.703
She keeps telling me that, yeah.

59:00.754 --> 59:03.955
Solely because no one
believed in what I did.

59:04.006 --> 59:05.039
But what was most important

59:05.090 --> 59:07.626
was that I believed
in what I was working for.

59:07.677 --> 59:10.169
COLLINS: I'm gonna go talk
to the caucus real quick.

59:10.220 --> 59:12.046
Yeah, let's get it to her, yeah?

59:12.097 --> 59:13.297
All right, got you.

59:13.348 --> 59:14.633
I feel like there's a lot more...

59:14.684 --> 59:16.175
That I could have been
having support,

59:16.226 --> 59:17.469
especially in this time of need

59:17.520 --> 59:18.886
where my character's
being attacked,

59:18.937 --> 59:20.389
you know, I'm having
to make apologies

59:20.440 --> 59:21.432
and do all this extra work

59:21.483 --> 59:22.932
the other candidates
aren't having to do.

59:22.983 --> 59:25.268
The fact that I lost
endorsements due to the video

59:25.319 --> 59:27.771
that came out, you know,
having the backing of a caucus

59:27.822 --> 59:30.566
will definitely help
make up for that, you know.

59:30.617 --> 59:32.693
If they really want to see
change in the program,

59:32.744 --> 59:34.611
they have an opportunity
right here, right now,

59:34.662 --> 59:37.406
to make that happen,
and for some reason,

59:37.457 --> 59:40.241
I feel like it's just not going.

59:40.292 --> 59:41.159
I-I don't know.

59:41.210 --> 59:42.827
So, like, as people of color,

59:42.878 --> 59:45.997
I think it's important that
we don't shut down people,

59:46.048 --> 59:50.001
we step and... and start
to educate people.

59:50.052 --> 59:52.555
[applause]

59:57.226 --> 59:58.552
Hi, guys.
My name is Bayo Collins

59:58.603 --> 1:00:00.554
from the Greater
Long Beach delegation.

1:00:00.605 --> 1:00:02.055
[together] Long Beach!

1:00:02.106 --> 1:00:03.222
And, um, I stand
before you today

1:00:03.273 --> 1:00:05.391
as a delegate of color.
I'll be honest with you guys.

1:00:05.443 --> 1:00:07.644
I've given a lot of speeches
over the last couple days,

1:00:07.695 --> 1:00:10.021
and this is the most nervous
I've felt all weekend.

1:00:10.072 --> 1:00:11.565
I feel like a deer
in headlights right now.

1:00:11.616 --> 1:00:14.275
I really don't know what
to say. I know a lot of people

1:00:14.326 --> 1:00:15.736
came up here with
a lot of great poems

1:00:15.787 --> 1:00:17.488
and I just wrote my name down
on the list,

1:00:17.539 --> 1:00:19.864
because I love just talking
and being in front of people,

1:00:19.915 --> 1:00:22.785
and I love interacting
with all of you guys. Um...

1:00:22.836 --> 1:00:25.788
I guess I just want to,
uh, share my YMCA experience

1:00:25.839 --> 1:00:28.164
with you guys. You know,
I've been through a lot

1:00:28.215 --> 1:00:29.165
these last couple days.

1:00:29.216 --> 1:00:33.294
You know, just... I guess
I just want to speak

1:00:33.345 --> 1:00:34.838
from the heart
with you guys, so...

1:00:34.889 --> 1:00:36.881
This program has a lot...
Done a lot for me.

1:00:36.932 --> 1:00:39.468
Um, the last couple years
before that,

1:00:39.519 --> 1:00:41.928
I was in a place where,
you know, I thought

1:00:41.979 --> 1:00:43.514
there was only
a few paths for me.

1:00:43.565 --> 1:00:45.139
You know, I thought
it was, you know,

1:00:45.190 --> 1:00:46.891
you can go
in the music industry,

1:00:46.942 --> 1:00:47.768
you can do sports,

1:00:47.819 --> 1:00:50.228
but what else is there for me
as a Black kid, you know?

1:00:50.279 --> 1:00:52.523
They don't really tell me
about these programs

1:00:52.574 --> 1:00:53.732
that we can do as people,

1:00:53.783 --> 1:00:55.609
so when I entered this program,

1:00:55.660 --> 1:00:57.401
it was so amazing
to be surrounded

1:00:57.452 --> 1:00:58.903
by like-minded people
just like me

1:00:58.954 --> 1:01:00.238
and people
that really understood

1:01:00.289 --> 1:01:02.825
there's more things to life
and that, you know,

1:01:02.876 --> 1:01:05.076
there's a lot more
that we could be doing.

1:01:05.127 --> 1:01:09.540
So as I entered this program,
I learned that, you know,

1:01:09.591 --> 1:01:10.331
I have a purpose.

1:01:10.382 --> 1:01:12.083
You know, this program
gave me purpose, basically,

1:01:12.134 --> 1:01:13.669
'cause I was
a person that was lost.

1:01:13.720 --> 1:01:15.002
And I don't know
if a lot of other people

1:01:15.053 --> 1:01:17.673
feel that same way. I know
this program is not perfect.

1:01:17.724 --> 1:01:19.132
But that's
what it's done for me,

1:01:19.183 --> 1:01:22.761
and, you know, I'm not the most
politically sound person

1:01:22.812 --> 1:01:24.847
out there, you know.
I'm learning as I go.

1:01:24.898 --> 1:01:27.558
And I never knew
that I loved politics,

1:01:27.609 --> 1:01:28.725
but now I think that I have...

1:01:28.776 --> 1:01:30.935
Now that I know I have
a passion for it,

1:01:30.986 --> 1:01:33.020
I thank the YMCA for that.

1:01:33.071 --> 1:01:35.106
Um, honestly...

1:01:35.157 --> 1:01:37.275
But yeah, so I
just wanted to say that.

1:01:37.326 --> 1:01:38.694
Thank you, guys, for your time.

1:01:38.745 --> 1:01:41.697
I hope everyone has
a good day. Thank you.

1:01:41.748 --> 1:01:44.374
[applause]

1:01:47.795 --> 1:01:49.370
[overlapping chatter]

1:01:49.421 --> 1:01:50.581
COLLINS:
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1:01:50.632 --> 1:01:52.081
Hi, Aidan. Good luck, man.

1:01:52.132 --> 1:01:55.344
Get some rest tonight, man.
You deserve it.

1:01:57.262 --> 1:01:58.462
- How you feel?
- Feeling awesome.

1:01:58.513 --> 1:02:00.214
- How do you feel right now?
- I feel good. You know,

1:02:00.265 --> 1:02:02.008
I've been trying to get rid
of all the negative press.

1:02:02.059 --> 1:02:03.677
Actually want to talk
to the chair really quick.

1:02:03.728 --> 1:02:05.261
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah, no, you're fine.

1:02:05.312 --> 1:02:06.889
I just want to tell you
you're doing a great job.

1:02:06.940 --> 1:02:08.222
- Keep it up.
- I appreciate that.

1:02:08.273 --> 1:02:09.223
Excuse me. Z, could I...

1:02:09.274 --> 1:02:10.601
Could I talk to you
for a second?

1:02:10.652 --> 1:02:12.977
- You got time?
- Hold on.

1:02:13.028 --> 1:02:13.854
Can we go outside?

1:02:13.905 --> 1:02:16.022
'Cause everyone
has to get out, but...

1:02:16.073 --> 1:02:17.867
Yeah, yeah.

1:02:19.493 --> 1:02:20.985
[overlapping chatter]

1:02:21.036 --> 1:02:23.915
[no audible dialogue]

1:02:25.249 --> 1:02:25.949
So hi. I'm Bayo.

1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:27.533
We haven't really met
formally, right?

1:02:27.585 --> 1:02:29.327
So you're the... you're the chair

1:02:29.378 --> 1:02:30.954
of the Colored Delegates
Caucus, right?

1:02:31.005 --> 1:02:32.163
- Mm-hmm.
- So my thing is...

1:02:32.214 --> 1:02:35.458
I just was thinking about this
as I was sitting there, right?

1:02:35.509 --> 1:02:38.377
Being, you know,
the only delegate of color

1:02:38.428 --> 1:02:42.465
that's still a finalist,
I was wondering, you know...

1:02:42.516 --> 1:02:43.634
I don't say this as a knock,

1:02:43.685 --> 1:02:45.051
but where's the support
from the color...

1:02:45.102 --> 1:02:46.720
You know, the Delegates
of Color, you know?

1:02:46.771 --> 1:02:48.221
I'm thinking, you know,
as a candidate,

1:02:48.272 --> 1:02:49.723
that people should know
that, you know,

1:02:49.774 --> 1:02:51.057
you're a resource to them,
you know:

1:02:51.108 --> 1:02:52.935
You're serving as inspiration.
You know, we have your back.

1:02:52.986 --> 1:02:54.728
I don't know if you're aware
of all the negative press

1:02:54.779 --> 1:02:56.229
and all the things
that have been going on,

1:02:56.280 --> 1:02:57.648
but it would be
really appreciative

1:02:57.699 --> 1:02:58.982
if I knew that I had the support

1:02:59.033 --> 1:03:00.692
of the people that are
supposed to be like me,

1:03:00.743 --> 1:03:01.944
- you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

1:03:01.995 --> 1:03:03.402
So I say, like,
you know, moving forward,

1:03:03.453 --> 1:03:07.448
try to maybe improve upon
letting the candidates know

1:03:07.499 --> 1:03:08.784
that you have their back,
you know,

1:03:08.835 --> 1:03:10.117
that they're a resource to you

1:03:10.168 --> 1:03:11.494
regardless of them
having a party.

1:03:11.545 --> 1:03:13.287
'Cause like I said,
because of the video,

1:03:13.338 --> 1:03:15.581
I lost all my party nominations.

1:03:15.633 --> 1:03:16.667
Now I just have Gold Party.

1:03:16.718 --> 1:03:19.335
So, you know, having
this caucus backing me...

1:03:19.386 --> 1:03:22.213
I'm not saying that I want
all you guys to vote for me

1:03:22.264 --> 1:03:23.840
or anything like that,
but I'm just saying

1:03:23.891 --> 1:03:25.383
just to know that it's
a resource that's there.

1:03:25.434 --> 1:03:27.010
So I don't know how you
feel about that or...

1:03:27.061 --> 1:03:28.929
Kinda get what you're saying.
You're saying you would like...

1:03:28.980 --> 1:03:31.305
Yeah, I get what you're saying.
Still be, like, supportive...

1:03:31.356 --> 1:03:34.225
Just let me know that you're
there. You know what I mean?

1:03:34.276 --> 1:03:35.559
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

1:03:35.610 --> 1:03:36.645
Don't worry. We got you.

1:03:36.696 --> 1:03:38.698
All right, appreciate that.

1:03:39.197 --> 1:03:42.284
All right, thank you so much.

1:03:47.539 --> 1:03:51.034

I was not a worthy candidate.</i>

1:03:51.085 --> 1:03:53.369
<i>I wouldn't... It would
really hurt me to know</i>

1:03:53.420 --> 1:03:54.663
<i>that my chances were impaired</i>

to tear a person down.</i>

1:03:58.342 --> 1:03:59.835

supposed to be</i>

1:03:59.886 --> 1:04:02.004

Our government to be run,</i>

1:04:02.055 --> 1:04:03.170
<i>and right now, it's looking</i>

1:04:03.221 --> 1:04:05.048

1:04:05.099 --> 1:04:06.717

1:04:06.768 --> 1:04:09.478

[overlapping chatter]

1:04:28.580 --> 1:04:31.282
I don't think
they're gonna stop it.

1:04:31.333 --> 1:04:31.992
It's okay.

1:04:32.043 --> 1:04:33.200
- Hit one part.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1:04:33.251 --> 1:04:34.828
You're gonna go over
your platform quick, then.

1:04:34.879 --> 1:04:37.998
You're talented, and, like,
you have good instincts.

1:04:38.049 --> 1:04:39.457
Like, you're gonna get up there,

1:04:39.508 --> 1:04:40.458
and you're gonna kill it,

1:04:40.509 --> 1:04:42.251
and, like, you're gonna
feel good when it's done.

1:04:42.302 --> 1:04:43.670
- All right.
- So, like, I don't want...

1:04:43.721 --> 1:04:45.338
Like, I just don't
want you to have,

1:04:45.389 --> 1:04:48.257
like, this insecurity
about that video

1:04:48.308 --> 1:04:49.550
and it stop you
from, like, being

1:04:49.601 --> 1:04:52.261
your full,
likeable, charismatic self.

1:04:52.312 --> 1:04:54.148
COLLINS:<i>Oh, no.</i>

1:04:55.942 --> 1:04:57.141
Okay, but if she introduces you,

1:04:57.192 --> 1:04:58.685
shall we say you're
from the Trout Party?

1:04:58.736 --> 1:05:00.269
I think she
should say that, okay?

1:05:00.320 --> 1:05:03.448
[overlapping chatter]

1:05:06.410 --> 1:05:07.903

to take this opportunity</i>

<i>"to address
my CONA application video.</i>

a poor choice of words

many of my fellow delegates.

more thorough research

youth governor I can be."

1:05:21.341 --> 1:05:22.458
- That's good.
- Solid.

1:05:22.509 --> 1:05:25.837
- I think we made this better.
- This whole taboo part

1:05:25.888 --> 1:05:27.047
can be really powerful.

1:05:27.098 --> 1:05:27.964
Emphasize that one?

1:05:28.015 --> 1:05:31.342
I mean, like, "Sexual assault
is taboo for a reason.

1:05:31.393 --> 1:05:33.762
"Like, it makes us
uncomfortable,

1:05:33.813 --> 1:05:36.314

This is a 16-year-old.

- I know.
- You know?

1:05:45.825 --> 1:05:50.236
Like, this is what
a youth governor candidate is,

1:05:50.287 --> 1:05:51.029
you know? Like...

1:05:51.080 --> 1:05:53.697
And we're not gonna
trash the other two,

1:05:53.748 --> 1:05:56.159
but, like, it looks
like they know everything.

1:05:56.210 --> 1:05:57.160
They've got everything...

1:05:57.211 --> 1:05:58.661
That's how I feel
when I'm up there.

1:05:58.712 --> 1:06:00.413

We're... We're kids.

- I'm like...

1:06:01.966 --> 1:06:04.509
Take this off.

1:06:05.011 --> 1:06:06.044
It still bothers me.

1:06:06.095 --> 1:06:08.254

1:06:15.062 --> 1:06:16.679
One more time.

1:06:16.730 --> 1:06:17.430
All right.

1:06:17.481 --> 1:06:19.141
Remember the emphasis.

1:06:19.192 --> 1:06:20.266
Okay.

1:06:20.317 --> 1:06:22.726
I know it's written,
but still...

1:06:22.777 --> 1:06:25.021
I got you. All right.

1:06:25.072 --> 1:06:26.355
I would like to take
this opportunity

1:06:26.406 --> 1:06:27.774
to address my CONA
application video.

1:06:27.825 --> 1:06:31.735
I had the opportunity to speak
with representatives from FLIP

1:06:31.786 --> 1:06:32.653
and other female leaders

1:06:32.704 --> 1:06:35.739
and brought out
my perspective on this issue.

1:06:35.790 --> 1:06:38.451
Sexual assault is
a taboo for a reason.

1:06:38.502 --> 1:06:42.122
It makes us uncomfortable,
and it's hard to talk about.

1:06:42.173 --> 1:06:43.247
We need to change that.

1:06:43.298 --> 1:06:44.248
As your youth governor,

1:06:44.299 --> 1:06:47.127
I'm not going to always
have all the answers.

1:06:47.178 --> 1:06:48.294
I'm only 16 years old.

1:06:48.345 --> 1:06:50.504
I want to do better
and do my due diligence

1:06:50.555 --> 1:06:53.008
at researching topics
I don't fully understand.

1:06:53.059 --> 1:06:54.633
I stand here today to tell you

1:06:54.684 --> 1:06:56.469
that I'm 100%
against sexual assault,

1:06:56.520 --> 1:06:59.222
and I am in favor
for respecting our victims.

1:06:59.273 --> 1:07:01.141
I will do a better job
moving forward

1:07:01.192 --> 1:07:03.726
and promise to be
more thorough with my research

1:07:03.777 --> 1:07:06.062
and be the best
youth governor I can be.

1:07:06.113 --> 1:07:07.521
Thank you so much.

1:07:07.572 --> 1:07:09.992
[cheering]

1:07:21.295 --> 1:07:25.123
SAMUELS: Conservative
delegates in Y&G,

1:07:25.174 --> 1:07:27.250
<i>I think they're more passionate</i>

1:07:27.301 --> 1:07:28.292
<i>than most conservatives,</i>

1:07:28.343 --> 1:07:30.003
<i>because in Y&G,
they're such a minority,</i>

1:07:30.054 --> 1:07:33.797
<i>so they have to fight
twice as hard to be heard.</i>

1:07:33.848 --> 1:07:36.968
<i>They have to speak on
as many bills as they can,</i>

1:07:37.019 --> 1:07:38.677
<i>because no one else
is speaking con</i>

1:07:38.728 --> 1:07:42.316
<i>on this bill
that everyone agrees with.</i>

1:07:43.400 --> 1:07:46.269
CLARK: As someone who's
unintentionally become

1:07:46.320 --> 1:07:48.854
the figurehead and
kind of the strawman

1:07:48.906 --> 1:07:50.689
behind conservative beliefs,

1:07:50.740 --> 1:07:52.192
I feel like none
of the candidates

1:07:52.243 --> 1:07:54.443
truly have
our interests in mind,

1:07:54.494 --> 1:07:57.571
and I really want to ensure
and talk to all of them

1:07:57.622 --> 1:08:00.324
and make sure
which one we can use

1:08:00.375 --> 1:08:02.035
to kind of push us forward more

1:08:02.086 --> 1:08:04.453
and is not going
to disown us at the end.

1:08:04.504 --> 1:08:07.165
<i>Because politics
in the United States</i>

1:08:07.216 --> 1:08:08.166
<i>is not about commitment.</i>

1:08:08.217 --> 1:08:11.553
<i>It's about
whose votes can I take?</i>

1:08:11.678 --> 1:08:13.255
BLAIN: It's not that I
want to break up

1:08:13.306 --> 1:08:14.547
the conservative voice at all.

1:08:14.598 --> 1:08:15.966
I think that
the conservative voice,

1:08:16.017 --> 1:08:17.508
I respect you, and I
respect your opinions.

1:08:17.559 --> 1:08:18.927
But it's just,
in the Avocado Party,

1:08:18.978 --> 1:08:20.761
we didn't have anybody with
conservative point of views,

1:08:20.812 --> 1:08:22.513
and everyone was agreeing
on the same thing,

1:08:22.564 --> 1:08:23.890
and I want those
conservatives in there

1:08:23.941 --> 1:08:26.059
sharing their opinions,
because, as you've seen,

1:08:26.110 --> 1:08:27.560
it's like the one party
of conservatives

1:08:27.611 --> 1:08:30.063
versus the... the five parties
of liberals.

1:08:30.114 --> 1:08:31.564
And I think that's fine,
because at least

1:08:31.615 --> 1:08:33.524
we can control what
our party wants to do.

1:08:33.575 --> 1:08:34.943
- Okay.
- We actually have a voice.

1:08:34.994 --> 1:08:35.986
Our voice would be strong,

1:08:36.037 --> 1:08:37.403
-because we would be united
-Okay.

1:08:37.454 --> 1:08:38.529
I think what a lot of people,

1:08:38.580 --> 1:08:39.906
especially you guys
don't understand,

1:08:39.957 --> 1:08:41.950
you have the numbers,
but we really had the passion.

1:08:42.001 --> 1:08:43.159
<i>Okay, I completely agree.</i>

1:08:43.210 --> 1:08:44.785
CLARK:<i>I'm currently
heavily debating</i>

1:08:44.836 --> 1:08:46.921
<i>on who I'm voting for.</i>

1:08:47.006 --> 1:08:48.664
<i>I have not told anyone</i>

1:08:48.715 --> 1:08:50.749
<i>my recommendation yet.</i>

1:08:50.800 --> 1:08:54.004
<i>Piper, I feel like
I could vote for her,</i>

1:08:54.055 --> 1:08:56.006
<i>because she is Trout,
and Trout is family,</i>

1:08:56.057 --> 1:08:58.591
<i>and I want her to win, because
I like her as a person.</i>

1:08:58.642 --> 1:09:02.053
But at the same time, she
needs to talk to our people,

1:09:02.104 --> 1:09:03.013
because that is her home.

1:09:03.064 --> 1:09:05.431
<i>It's about finding which one</i>

1:09:05.482 --> 1:09:07.474
<i>will truly help
the conservatives.</i>

1:09:07.525 --> 1:09:08.851
All right.
So thank you, Aidan.

1:09:08.902 --> 1:09:10.186
- Of course.
- I'll see you later.

1:09:10.237 --> 1:09:11.437
And thank you.
Nice meeting you.

1:09:11.488 --> 1:09:13.606
I have also been working
with my friend Nick,

1:09:13.657 --> 1:09:14.940
because we've kind of discovered

1:09:14.992 --> 1:09:20.071
that there is somewhat of
a evil, fascist sect of Y&G,

1:09:20.122 --> 1:09:22.073
and we're focused
on kind of exposing that

1:09:22.124 --> 1:09:25.710
and planning out
what we should do about it.

1:09:26.212 --> 1:09:29.247
SAMUELS: So I'm, like,
sitting there

1:09:29.298 --> 1:09:32.334
<i>in a convention center room,</i>

1:09:32.385 --> 1:09:33.667
<i>and Ethan comes up to me</i>

1:09:33.718 --> 1:09:36.296
<i>with this very intense,
important news,</i>

1:09:36.347 --> 1:09:40.226
<i>and I was like,
"What could this be?"</i>

1:09:40.309 --> 1:09:41.301
<i>And then it turns out</i>

1:09:41.352 --> 1:09:43.053
<i>that there's this crazy
group chat going on,</i>

1:09:43.104 --> 1:09:46.264
<i>and they're spreading
anti-Semitic memes about me.</i>

1:09:46.315 --> 1:09:49.225
<i>And I was just
kind of, like, "What?"</i>

1:09:49.276 --> 1:09:52.770
CLARK:<i>An Instagram profile
kind of emerged,</i>

1:09:52.821 --> 1:09:55.481
<i>and it's an alt-right group.</i>

1:09:55.532 --> 1:09:59.110
<i>And what we uncovered
is very disturbing.</i>

1:09:59.161 --> 1:10:01.904
<i>As of right now, we're
conducting an operation</i>

1:10:01.955 --> 1:10:04.615
<i>called Operation Golden Bear...</i>

1:10:04.666 --> 1:10:07.493
<i>and hopefully eliminate
these fascist elements</i>

1:10:07.544 --> 1:10:09.870
<i>and kind of clear
the Trout Party</i>

1:10:09.921 --> 1:10:10.871
<i>of its demonization,</i>

1:10:10.922 --> 1:10:12.415
<i>because Trout
does not stand for that.</i>

1:10:12.466 --> 1:10:17.212
So Nick here has actually been
incredibly important in this,

1:10:17.263 --> 1:10:20.756
because I told him
about this information,

1:10:20.807 --> 1:10:23.634
and I said I need
someone to get inside

1:10:23.685 --> 1:10:25.261
and to find out
what these guys are doing.

1:10:25.312 --> 1:10:27.596
We decided that we should
go ahead and try to figure out

1:10:27.647 --> 1:10:30.849
who they were, and the only way
for me to do that was to...

1:10:30.900 --> 1:10:33.018
disclaimer,
I disagree with everything

1:10:33.070 --> 1:10:34.104
these people profess...

1:10:34.155 --> 1:10:36.147
But, uh, was through pretending

1:10:36.198 --> 1:10:37.690
to be a neo-Nazi myself.

1:10:37.741 --> 1:10:39.650
And so I basically
went into the DMs,

1:10:39.701 --> 1:10:41.403
and we had
political discussions,

1:10:41.454 --> 1:10:44.239
you know, that were
quite offensive, to be honest,

1:10:44.290 --> 1:10:48.752
and, you know he...
I gained his trust eventually.

1:10:49.336 --> 1:10:50.120
<i>I learned later</i>

1:10:50.171 --> 1:10:51.537
<i>that if Piper Samuels wins,</i>

1:10:51.588 --> 1:10:52.705
<i>they were gonna be dropping</i>

1:10:52.756 --> 1:10:54.457
<i>anti-Semitic memes via AirDrop.</i>

1:10:54.508 --> 1:10:55.999
<i>So right after this,
we're gonna go</i>

1:10:56.050 --> 1:10:57.751
<i>and stop and tell
the advisors about it.</i>

1:10:57.802 --> 1:10:59.586
CLARK:<i>Because
they're in Trout</i>

1:10:59.637 --> 1:11:01.588
<i>and they're undermining
our democratic process</i>

1:11:01.639 --> 1:11:04.976
<i>and all the work
that Trout has done.</i>

1:11:08.230 --> 1:11:11.598
SAMUELS: Ethan,
watching the way he worked,

1:11:11.649 --> 1:11:14.059
<i>more than anyone else,
really cued me in</i>

1:11:14.111 --> 1:11:16.396
<i>to the conservative
experience in Y&G,</i>

1:11:16.447 --> 1:11:19.232
<i>'cause he... you can tell
he just cares so much</i>

1:11:19.283 --> 1:11:20.358
<i>about what he believes in,</i>

1:11:20.409 --> 1:11:22.776
<i>and he's
a very respectable person.</i>

1:11:22.827 --> 1:11:26.239
<i>And he was very nice to me, too.</i>

1:11:26.290 --> 1:11:28.366
<i>I'm happy that Ethan
handled that situation</i>

1:11:28.417 --> 1:11:30.951
<i>in the way that
the real government isn't,</i>

1:11:31.002 --> 1:11:32.287
<i>which is calling it out</i>

1:11:32.338 --> 1:11:34.122
<i>and saying,
"That's not what we are.</i>

1:11:34.173 --> 1:11:36.633
<i>That's not the Trout Party."</i>

1:11:49.813 --> 1:11:51.139
[overlapping chatter]

1:11:51.190 --> 1:11:55.684
SAMUELS: I think
everyone in Y&G truly cares

1:11:55.735 --> 1:11:59.198
<i>about some political issue.</i>

1:12:09.458 --> 1:12:13.286
SAMUELS: Not everyone has to
love all aspects of politics.

1:12:13.337 --> 1:12:15.288
<i>But I think everyone
has one issue</i>

1:12:15.339 --> 1:12:18.007
<i>that they're passionate about.</i>

1:12:18.551 --> 1:12:21.169
Open up to all the parties
so anyone can...

SAMUELS:<i>And once you put</i>

1:12:24.557 --> 1:12:26.089
<i>all those
little issues together,</i>

1:12:26.140 --> 1:12:31.313
<i>then you have this
great-big political change.</i>

1:12:37.110 --> 1:12:40.230
<i>Y&G just gives me hope
that, like, we can actually</i>

1:12:40.281 --> 1:12:43.690

<i>and make a big stomp
on the political world.</i>

1:13:24.408 --> 1:13:26.149

No, I wouldn't say that.

1:14:10.287 --> 1:14:13.864
So it is now my honor to
announce the two finalists...

1:14:13.915 --> 1:14:17.628
- Oh, shit.
- For 72nd Youth Governor.

1:14:22.840 --> 1:14:23.707
When they are announced,

1:14:23.758 --> 1:14:25.251
they will make their way
to the lectern

1:14:25.302 --> 1:14:28.296
and have one minute
to deliver brief remarks.

1:14:28.347 --> 1:14:32.383
Then delegations will be
given a break to caucus vote.

1:14:32.434 --> 1:14:33.842
Are you guys ready?

1:16:52.616 --> 1:16:55.243
[cheering]

1:16:56.829 --> 1:16:58.529
Thank you all so much

1:16:58.580 --> 1:17:00.782
for this incredible opportunity.

1:17:00.833 --> 1:17:03.033
This weekend has been
one of the most amazing

1:17:03.084 --> 1:17:06.328
and empowering weekends
of my entire life,

1:17:06.379 --> 1:17:09.791
but this weekend
has not been perfect.

1:17:09.842 --> 1:17:11.793
I have been the target of sexism

1:17:11.844 --> 1:17:14.002
and people doubting me
because I am a woman.

1:17:14.053 --> 1:17:17.214
I have had anti-Semitic memes
made about me

1:17:17.265 --> 1:17:18.131
and comments made to me,

1:17:18.182 --> 1:17:21.343
and I know I'm not the only one
in this program

1:17:21.394 --> 1:17:22.553
who faces discrimination.

1:17:22.604 --> 1:17:25.848
Youth & Government is
not a place for sexism,

1:17:25.899 --> 1:17:27.099
homophobia, or racism,

1:17:27.150 --> 1:17:30.143
and as Youth Governor,
I will make it my priority

1:17:30.194 --> 1:17:32.855
to make this program
more intersectional

1:17:32.906 --> 1:17:34.439
and more equitable
for all delegates.

1:17:34.491 --> 1:17:37.901
Thank you, because together
we can show the real government

1:17:37.952 --> 1:17:40.070
that we are a model
legislature and court

1:17:40.121 --> 1:17:42.030
and not a mock
legislature and court.

1:17:42.081 --> 1:17:43.699
Once again, my name
is Piper Samuels,

1:17:43.750 --> 1:17:47.285
and I'm running to serve
as your 72nd Youth Governor.

1:17:47.336 --> 1:17:49.964
[cheering]

1:18:04.145 --> 1:18:05.638
[overlapping chatter]

1:18:05.689 --> 1:18:06.889
- Thank you.
- Sorry, man.

1:18:06.940 --> 1:18:08.348
You did a good job, though.

1:18:08.399 --> 1:18:09.767
- I'm excited.
- Where's Bayo sitting?

1:18:09.818 --> 1:18:11.894
- Let's go.
- Where's Bayo sitting?

1:18:11.945 --> 1:18:14.030
Where's... Where's Bayo sitting?

1:18:17.743 --> 1:18:18.734
I'm proud of you, bro.

1:18:18.785 --> 1:18:20.528
Everything you did,
amazing, bro.

1:18:20.579 --> 1:18:22.822
I'm really excited to go
to Con with you this year.

1:18:22.873 --> 1:18:25.282
I have nothing but respect
to you, bro.

1:18:25.333 --> 1:18:27.535
Oh, my gosh, thank you.

1:18:27.586 --> 1:18:28.410
I'm sorry. Like...

1:18:28.461 --> 1:18:31.706
- Yeah, you really just...
- that was something, and it...

1:18:31.757 --> 1:18:32.707
WOMAN: During the break,

1:18:32.758 --> 1:18:34.917
you will all have
an opportunity to caucus

1:18:34.968 --> 1:18:36.919
with your delegation
and cast your votes

1:18:36.970 --> 1:18:40.130
for your choice
for 72nd Youth Governor.

1:18:40.181 --> 1:18:42.507
GIRL: While we do that,
it is now my pleasure

1:18:42.559 --> 1:18:45.177
to announce the 72nd
Trout Party Chair

1:18:45.228 --> 1:18:48.848
is Ethan Clark
from SVC El Camino.

1:18:48.899 --> 1:18:50.182
I-I can't believe that I won.

1:18:50.233 --> 1:18:51.809
It's incredible.
I'm so happy right now.

1:18:51.860 --> 1:18:56.188
I-I think I'm gonna
try to revolutionize Y&G.

1:18:56.239 --> 1:18:57.314
This is a perfect opportunity

1:18:57.365 --> 1:18:59.191
to get the conservative
voices out there,

1:18:59.242 --> 1:19:00.651
to clarify that conservatism

1:19:00.702 --> 1:19:03.320
does not mean Republicanism
or Democrats.

1:19:03.371 --> 1:19:04.906
It means being a Trout,

1:19:04.957 --> 1:19:08.618
to the extent where Trout
is the party of conservatives,

1:19:08.669 --> 1:19:11.161
but it's also the party
of America and debates.

1:19:11.212 --> 1:19:13.205
And Operation Golden Bear
was a...

1:19:13.256 --> 1:19:15.040
It was a complete success.

1:19:15.091 --> 1:19:16.499
It was incredible.

1:19:16.550 --> 1:19:17.919
We told Piper and her staff

1:19:17.970 --> 1:19:19.377
that, "Guys,
we have this information."

1:19:19.428 --> 1:19:22.297
<i>They are gonna get kicked out
of Youth & Government.</i>

1:19:22.348 --> 1:19:23.506
<i>And there's this great thing,</i>

1:19:23.557 --> 1:19:24.967
<i>'cause right after we did that,</i>

1:19:25.018 --> 1:19:26.594
<i>we were walking back
to our hotel room,</i>

1:19:26.645 --> 1:19:28.428
<i>and we saw the group
walking outside,</i>

1:19:28.479 --> 1:19:33.234
<i>so we got to eye them down
when we went up the elevator.</i>

1:19:34.820 --> 1:19:37.145
Operation Golden Bear
was a success.

1:19:37.196 --> 1:19:40.116
California will stay golden.

1:19:43.244 --> 1:19:44.612
BLAIN: Okay, wait, wait.
Quick question.

1:19:44.663 --> 1:19:46.488
So I'm only gonna thank
four people in the speech.

1:19:46.539 --> 1:19:48.198
- You think that's okay?
- Okay, then you can

1:19:48.249 --> 1:19:51.962
- say Avocado...
- Sammo and Pali.

1:19:57.216 --> 1:19:59.970
[together] Aidan Blain!

1:20:00.511 --> 1:20:02.931
Aidan Blain!

1:20:03.056 --> 1:20:05.507
[together] Piper Samuels!

1:20:05.558 --> 1:20:07.927
Piper Samuels!

1:20:07.978 --> 1:20:08.719
Piper Samuels!

1:20:08.770 --> 1:20:10.930
Chant starts up there.
That's funny.

1:20:10.981 --> 1:20:13.098
Aidan Blain!

1:20:13.149 --> 1:20:15.609
Piper Samuels!

1:20:16.360 --> 1:20:19.948
Oh!

1:20:24.577 --> 1:20:26.946
<i>Each delegation
should select two delegates</i>

1:20:26.997 --> 1:20:28.488
<i>who will present
their delegation votes</i>

1:20:28.539 --> 1:20:32.200
<i>during the convention-style
election run this evening.</i>

1:20:32.251 --> 1:20:35.005
[music playing]

1:20:43.346 --> 1:20:46.631
It is now in order for
the convention-style election

1:20:46.683 --> 1:20:49.518
of the 72nd Youth Governor.

1:20:54.315 --> 1:20:59.729
The Westside delegation proudly
casts its votes as follows.

1:20:59.780 --> 1:21:01.479
38 votes for Aidan Blain.

1:21:01.530 --> 1:21:03.273

<i>And zero abstentions.</i>

Yeah!

1:22:57.605 --> 1:23:00.808

1:23:00.859 --> 1:23:01.851
Aidan Blain.

1:23:01.902 --> 1:23:04.112
[cheering]

1:23:06.739 --> 1:23:08.950
Oh, my God!

1:23:10.534 --> 1:23:13.287
[music playing]

1:23:26.550 --> 1:23:28.511
You did it!

1:23:30.387 --> 1:23:33.307
[cheering]

1:23:34.059 --> 1:23:36.810
[music playing]

1:23:46.947 --> 1:23:49.522
COLLINS: Sadly, my time
has come to an end.

1:23:49.573 --> 1:23:51.483
<i>You know, it was unfortunate.</i>

1:23:51.534 --> 1:23:52.860
But I had a hard time

1:23:52.911 --> 1:23:54.444
picking what candidate
I wanted to vote for,

1:23:54.495 --> 1:23:56.446
'cause I never thought about
that, you know. I never...

1:23:56.497 --> 1:23:57.990
When I'm thinking
about running for something,

1:23:58.041 --> 1:23:59.324
I don't see myself losing,
you know?

1:23:59.375 --> 1:24:02.036
But, um, I still have
a lot of supporters out there

1:24:02.087 --> 1:24:03.453
still talking to me,
saying hello

1:24:03.504 --> 1:24:04.662
and stuff like that, you know.

1:24:04.713 --> 1:24:05.998
The mark I left on this program

1:24:06.049 --> 1:24:07.707
can't be taken away
by anybody, win or lose,

1:24:07.758 --> 1:24:11.503
so when I come back next year,
I'll still have notoriety.

1:24:11.554 --> 1:24:12.754
People are gonna know who I am.

1:24:12.805 --> 1:24:14.215
They're gonna support
what I'm doing,

1:24:14.266 --> 1:24:16.508
and, you know,
whatever I run for next year,

1:24:16.559 --> 1:24:18.384
I'll be sure to get.

1:24:18.435 --> 1:24:24.432
As my last official act
as youth governor,

1:24:24.483 --> 1:24:26.434
I would like
to entertain a motion

1:24:26.485 --> 1:24:28.311
to adjourn
this closing joint session

1:24:28.362 --> 1:24:32.233
of the 71st Model
Legislature and Court.

1:24:32.284 --> 1:24:34.286
[cheering]

1:24:39.165 --> 1:24:42.076
I feel...

1:24:42.127 --> 1:24:42.659
content.

1:24:42.710 --> 1:24:44.536
I know that's, like,
probably not the answer

1:24:44.587 --> 1:24:46.205
that, like,
most people would expect,

1:24:46.256 --> 1:24:50.708
but, um, this race
wasn't what I expected,

1:24:50.759 --> 1:24:51.709
and it was really hard.

1:24:51.760 --> 1:24:53.212
<i>It was, like, the hardest thing</i>

1:24:53.263 --> 1:24:55.172
<i>I've ever done
in my entire life, 100%.</i>

1:24:55.223 --> 1:24:59.301
The situation I was put in
was, like...

1:24:59.352 --> 1:25:01.761
really difficult to maneuver,

1:25:01.812 --> 1:25:04.932
and I really was trying
so hard from the beginning

1:25:04.983 --> 1:25:06.267
not to have a defeatist attitude

1:25:06.318 --> 1:25:09.228
because of all the obstacles
that were put upon me.

1:25:09.279 --> 1:25:10.812
And the fact that I could run

1:25:10.863 --> 1:25:12.397
with a party
that I don't agree with

1:25:12.448 --> 1:25:15.234
and make it to second place
is... I don't know.

1:25:15.285 --> 1:25:17.278
I think it's incredible.
I'm proud of myself,

1:25:17.329 --> 1:25:22.167
and I genuinely do feel
this experience has been a win.

1:25:22.833 --> 1:25:26.744
BLAIN: I'm ready to represent
4,000 people in a program

1:25:26.795 --> 1:25:29.957
<i>that has impacted their lives
so heavily.</i>

1:25:30.008 --> 1:25:33.219
<i>And I think
there's still hope for us.</i>

1:25:33.594 --> 1:25:38.048
<i>Yeah, we may be 16-,
17-, 18-year-olds,</i>

1:25:38.099 --> 1:25:40.352
<i>but we respect each other.</i>

1:25:40.476 --> 1:25:41.426
<i>I think that adults,</i>

1:25:41.477 --> 1:25:44.138
<i>especially in the current
political climate,</i>

1:25:44.189 --> 1:25:45.973
<i>don't respect each other.</i>

1:25:46.024 --> 1:25:47.182
<i>I think that when they see</i>

1:25:47.233 --> 1:25:50.019
<i>a bunch of teenagers doing it...</i>

1:25:50.070 --> 1:25:51.186
<i>might reflect on themselves</i>

1:25:51.237 --> 1:25:53.396
<i>and take a second thought
about learn how to be</i>

1:25:53.447 --> 1:25:57.285
<i>part of something
that's bigger than yourself.</i>
