WEBVTT

00:54.480 --> 00:55.480
Hey, be good.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.672
Ladies, are we
having a good time?

00:57.760 --> 00:59.159
You know it.

01:01.680 --> 01:03.716
Shayla, you know you're
my brown sugar Barbie.

01:03.800 --> 01:06.234
Oh. And you're
my Asian daddy.

01:06.320 --> 01:07.912
You're a naughty girl, Shayla.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.718
Wait. I'll be right back.
Okay, don't tease me.

01:09.840 --> 01:12.035
You ready?
Oh, my God.

01:12.120 --> 01:13.394
Okay, just... Yes.

01:13.480 --> 01:14.629
Yes. Yes.

01:14.760 --> 01:16.640
Bounce the mouse, big daddy!
Bounce the mouse!

01:16.720 --> 01:17.869
Beat me!

01:18.840 --> 01:21.798
You are the nastiest
of all girls...

01:22.080 --> 01:23.229
Damn it!

01:23.320 --> 01:25.390
Hold that thought.
I gotta go. Okay, screenshot.

01:29.760 --> 01:30.760
Looking good.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.239
We call those "ladies."

01:32.360 --> 01:33.679
But of course,
you wouldn't know that,

01:33.760 --> 01:35.637
because you've never
been with one before.

01:35.720 --> 01:36.789
Come on, man.

01:36.880 --> 01:40.953
That old hackers-being-nerds clichÃ©,
that's pretty dated now.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.075
I do a'ight.

01:44.720 --> 01:48.474
Okay, the encoded cell phone
is nearly done.

01:48.560 --> 01:51.996
And all I gots to do is slap
a little Bone Machine on it.

01:52.080 --> 01:54.196
Stop talking. Just
get me a secure line.

01:54.280 --> 01:57.158
And stop speaking
to me as if I care.

01:58.240 --> 01:59.958
There you go.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.400
God,
I hate you so much.

02:03.360 --> 02:04.793
Eavesdropping here.

02:12.960 --> 02:13.995
It's Griffin.

02:14.120 --> 02:18.272
You owe me a million dollars
and a sincere apology.

02:18.440 --> 02:20.908
Antonio. What are
you talking about?

02:21.000 --> 02:22.672
Well, in the language of bribes,

02:22.760 --> 02:25.115
taking the money
equals "I accept."

02:25.200 --> 02:27.191
I see that you
took the money,

02:27.280 --> 02:29.316
so we have
an implied agreement.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.995
The commissioner of ports
is a team player. Yay!

02:33.080 --> 02:34.479
Then my shipment gets busted?

02:34.560 --> 02:36.232
Come on. Ooh!

02:36.320 --> 02:38.390
Your shipment was held up because
I didn't get the money.

02:38.480 --> 02:39.833
I thought you called it off.

02:39.920 --> 02:41.148
Point is, you had
a job to do.

02:41.240 --> 02:43.515
I have a job to do
when I get my...

02:44.800 --> 02:47.030
Ooh! Ooh! Is my guy there?
Tell him to wait.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.394
Wait! He said wait.

02:48.520 --> 02:49.873
Antonio, listen, please.

02:49.960 --> 02:51.640
If I knew the deal
was still on, I would...

02:51.680 --> 02:53.033
Put it on speaker, please.

02:55.480 --> 02:57.994
There.
Now I feel like I'm participating.

02:58.280 --> 02:59.508
Now,

03:00.320 --> 03:01.469
go for it.

03:05.280 --> 03:06.952
So, if he didn't
get the money,

03:07.080 --> 03:09.958
find out who in my organization
stole from me,

03:10.040 --> 03:11.678
and kill them.
Oh, shit.

03:16.960 --> 03:19.997
Now, my little lovely,
where were we?

04:01.040 --> 04:03.315
I got my eye
on our man, Troy.

04:03.480 --> 04:05.072
That's the biggest
M-CAT dealer

04:05.160 --> 04:07.310
south of Knoxville,
right there.

04:07.480 --> 04:10.392
We got 100K
in impound cash,

04:10.520 --> 04:13.751
and a lieutenant
with real trust issues.

04:14.680 --> 04:16.238
This could get interesting.

04:16.360 --> 04:18.190
Ready, partner?

04:18.360 --> 04:20.749
All day, every day.

04:20.839 --> 04:22.831
Twice on Sundays.

04:24.360 --> 04:26.635
All right, you stay
frosty out there, Mayfield.

04:26.720 --> 04:28.358
I hear this guy
can be trigger happy.

04:28.440 --> 04:30.954
Don't worry.
I got your back.

04:31.080 --> 04:32.798
I got your back, too, James.

04:32.880 --> 04:34.108
Way before he had your back,
I had your back.

04:34.200 --> 04:37.875
What part of "Stay off the goddamn mic"
don't you understand, Ben?

04:37.960 --> 04:40.599
You're just a beat cop,
one month out the academy.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.159
You're lucky I
let you shadow us.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.275
Copy that.
Now shut up.

04:43.360 --> 04:45.794
Hey, James, real quick,
just before I start shadowing,

04:45.880 --> 04:47.359
I don't know about
this Mayfield guy.

04:47.440 --> 04:49.431
I mean, he's big and all,
and that's fine

04:49.520 --> 04:50.873
if we trying to
start a rap label.

04:50.960 --> 04:52.552
But we're here
to be detectives,

04:52.640 --> 04:55.029
and you know what you
need to be a detective? A big brain.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.235
You know what,
I'm not convinced

04:56.320 --> 04:58.629
that you got a big brain
inside that tiny head.

04:58.720 --> 04:59.720
So say you.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.358
It's a physiological
impossibility.

05:01.440 --> 05:03.476
Oh, look who's breaking out
the double-point Scrabble words.

05:03.560 --> 05:05.039
All right,
everybody just be quiet.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.350
And, Ben, stay off
the goddamn radio.

05:13.560 --> 05:14.754
These are them
now, boss.

05:20.080 --> 05:22.071
Got what we need?
Cash first.

05:22.160 --> 05:24.116
Must be a misunderstanding.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.073
Look, we can
do this two ways,

05:26.840 --> 05:28.876
our way or the hard way.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.756
Which is our way anyway.

05:34.080 --> 05:35.877
Now, since you
put it that way,

05:35.960 --> 05:37.439
we got ourselves a deal.

05:41.760 --> 05:43.796
Shit. It's a gun.
Zoom in.

05:44.920 --> 05:46.558
Guys, I'm coming out there.
I'm coming out there right now.

05:46.640 --> 05:47.868
Just sit tight.
That's James' orders.

05:47.960 --> 05:49.160
You don't know
James like I do.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.111
That's the look
of needing Ben.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.680
He's shaking with terror!
Look at him!

05:52.760 --> 05:54.193
That is my
partner out there!

05:54.280 --> 05:56.157
You hear me?
I'm coming in hot!

05:56.280 --> 05:57.395
Call it in.

05:57.480 --> 05:59.198
Now, why you wanna
go and do that?

05:59.280 --> 06:01.157
Just hand over that cash
and we got ourselves a deal.

06:01.280 --> 06:04.636
Now, are you sure you
wanna go this route? Oh, I'm sure.

06:09.520 --> 06:10.555
The hell?

06:23.320 --> 06:24.389
Shit.

06:33.680 --> 06:35.318
One second.

06:35.440 --> 06:36.873
Oh, shit.

06:37.800 --> 06:39.472
Come on, turn off.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.319
God damn it. Stop!

06:59.160 --> 07:00.991
Did I interrupt
something? Huh?

07:01.080 --> 07:02.240
What are you doing?

07:02.520 --> 07:03.873
Did I break up your party?

07:04.880 --> 07:06.359
Funny thing is,

07:06.440 --> 07:08.749
I see all these muscle cars

07:08.840 --> 07:11.070
but I don't see no muscle.

07:11.280 --> 07:12.998
Boss, you want me to put
a slug in this one first?

07:13.120 --> 07:14.633
Oh, is that supposed
to scare me?

07:14.720 --> 07:18.156
Let me ask you a question.
Would you be scared if you knew this?

07:18.240 --> 07:19.680
Kalaboom.
Kalaboom. Kinny.

07:22.520 --> 07:25.034
That's that Muay Thai
kicking back in.

07:25.240 --> 07:27.435
Muscle memory.
Unconscious.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.556
Are you eyeballing me?

07:30.280 --> 07:32.032
You sneaking up on me?

07:32.280 --> 07:34.714
Because this is all open.

07:35.040 --> 07:36.040
Ha!

07:36.560 --> 07:37.913
Kick move! Oh.

07:44.040 --> 07:45.155
Is that yours?

07:58.560 --> 07:59.675
Mayfield!

08:06.840 --> 08:08.990
I got you, James!
Give me your gun.

08:09.080 --> 08:11.071
I got him! Foot chase!

08:12.440 --> 08:13.793
Foot chase!

08:13.960 --> 08:14.995
Hey! Ben!

08:15.080 --> 08:17.310
Everybody move!
Police!

08:27.360 --> 08:29.590
Damn pig.

08:39.760 --> 08:40.909
Thanks for the ride.

08:45.640 --> 08:46.755
Hold on.

08:54.560 --> 08:55.560
Shit!

08:59.280 --> 09:00.633
I'm coming, James!

09:00.720 --> 09:01.789
Oh, my God.

09:06.200 --> 09:07.474
Stop!

09:09.800 --> 09:10.869
Ben, move!

09:10.960 --> 09:12.400
You think I'm
playing games with you?

09:12.480 --> 09:13.879
Move!

09:15.880 --> 09:17.393
Oh, no, he didn't!

09:25.000 --> 09:26.319
James! Watch out!

09:26.640 --> 09:27.709
Watch out!

09:27.840 --> 09:29.159
Oh, shit!

09:36.960 --> 09:37.960
Oh!

09:58.520 --> 09:59.520
Oh, James.

09:59.640 --> 10:00.789
What, did we kill him?

10:00.920 --> 10:02.433
Just a little fender bender.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.033
Little fender bender,
my ass!

10:09.600 --> 10:10.600
Get up!

10:11.200 --> 10:12.872
That's for
shooting my partner.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.711
What you got here?

10:18.280 --> 10:20.555
This looks like
more than just drugs.

10:27.880 --> 10:29.359
Mayfield is out for
weeks because of you,

10:29.480 --> 10:31.710
and you bring him flowers?
It's a bad choice.

10:31.800 --> 10:32.800
Well, I disagree.

10:32.880 --> 10:34.472
I'm the only one that got
Mayfield something, James.

10:34.560 --> 10:35.959
Because you the one
that got him shot!

10:36.040 --> 10:38.349
Okay, well, listen. I went to the
gift shop. They had two choices.

10:38.440 --> 10:39.960
He's not pregnant,
so I went with this.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.029
I just thought it
was a better fit.

10:41.160 --> 10:43.196
Just get rid of them.
Fine.

10:43.280 --> 10:45.635
Hey, man, congratulations.
Everybody heard about what you did.

10:45.720 --> 10:46.789
All right.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.075
What do you got?
What do you got?

10:49.160 --> 10:50.639
Are you gonna
head this one?

10:50.720 --> 10:52.551
Go, go. Yeah.

10:53.720 --> 10:54.720
What you got for me?

10:55.080 --> 10:57.992
I tried to get into this,
and it fried my computer.

10:58.080 --> 10:59.832
It's like it's got
acid for blood.

10:59.920 --> 11:00.989
Aliens.
Mmm-hmm.

11:02.680 --> 11:03.680
Go.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.751
I've never seen
a device locked this tight.

11:05.840 --> 11:07.034
Someone encrypted this

11:07.120 --> 11:09.031
to a level we can't crack.
Hackers.

11:09.320 --> 11:10.878
Like, freelance hackers.

11:10.960 --> 11:12.678
Which would make
a hacker a fracker.

11:12.760 --> 11:15.433
Do you ever listen to the shit
that fly out your mouth?

11:15.760 --> 11:17.034
No.

11:17.120 --> 11:18.519
This is
next-level hacking.

11:18.600 --> 11:19.919
The only way we
got lucky is because

11:20.000 --> 11:22.560
our guy has an ego
and he left his tag.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.676
Who would do that?
This guy, out of Miami.

11:24.760 --> 11:26.910
He look like a low
budget-ass Jackie Chan.

11:27.040 --> 11:29.918
That was a good one.
I know.

11:30.040 --> 11:32.110
And get this,
his handle's Bone Machine.

11:32.440 --> 11:33.998
All right,
let me talk to Brooks.

11:34.640 --> 11:36.358
- You want me to come with you...
- No.

11:36.440 --> 11:37.509
So Troy's
trying to become

11:37.600 --> 11:39.556
the new kingpin of Atlanta,
and what do you do?

11:39.640 --> 11:41.392
Lose a hundred grand
of the city's money,

11:41.480 --> 11:43.630
wind up completely destroying
a parking structure,

11:43.720 --> 11:45.358
you get your
partner shot? Nice.

11:45.440 --> 11:47.749
Well, in his defense,
Mayfield wasn't his true partner.

11:47.840 --> 11:49.876
The grown-ups
are speaking, Ben.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.598
You need to get me
something on this guy.

11:51.680 --> 11:53.033
I've got three,
maybe four days

11:53.120 --> 11:54.109
before I have
to let him go.

11:54.200 --> 11:55.553
Look, I found
a guy in Miami

11:55.640 --> 11:58.029
that encrypted
Troy's flash drive.

11:58.120 --> 12:00.714
I think he can lead me
to Troy's supplier.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.677
I need to go down there
and scoop this dude up.

12:02.760 --> 12:05.115
Two days, tops.
Milk run.

12:05.200 --> 12:07.760
Good. So get a team
together and fix this.

12:09.960 --> 12:12.838
What was that?
Something went in there.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.275
Did it get you too, or no?

12:15.360 --> 12:17.316
Pollen or something.
I don't know what it is.

12:17.400 --> 12:18.515
I'm free, though.

12:18.600 --> 12:20.079
So if you guys wanna
put that team together...

12:20.160 --> 12:21.115
But you're not
a detective, Ben.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.758
You're barely even
a probationary officer.

12:22.840 --> 12:24.558
And after this mess, you're about
an inch from being fired.

12:24.680 --> 12:27.717
Okay, listen. Sir, you
can't teach what I have.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.069
I'm like a cat.
Hmm?

12:29.160 --> 12:32.357
I'm like half cop, half puma,
but I'm all detective.

12:32.480 --> 12:34.914
Like, I'll get in your ass.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
You know what?

12:36.080 --> 12:38.150
The Psych department
wants me to take less responsibility.

12:38.240 --> 12:39.593
So, James,
Mr. Barber here

12:39.680 --> 12:41.113
is still technically in
his work placement,

12:41.200 --> 12:43.395
so if you wanna take
him to Miami, you can.

12:43.520 --> 12:46.637
But if he screws up,
in any way, it's on you.

12:46.720 --> 12:47.994
Come on.

12:48.120 --> 12:49.189
No.

12:49.280 --> 12:50.280
Everybody's busy.

12:50.360 --> 12:51.634
I'll fly solo.
All right.

12:57.040 --> 12:58.268
What was that, man?

12:58.360 --> 13:00.476
You're supposed to have
my back back there, James.

13:00.560 --> 13:01.800
We family.
Family's not supposed

13:01.840 --> 13:02.909
to be letting shit
go down like that.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.036
Stop. Stop.
It's not about family.

13:05.160 --> 13:07.435
It's not about friends.
It's not about feelings.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.909
It's about you not knowing
how serious this work is.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.240
I know how serious
this work is.

13:11.280 --> 13:12.633
That's why I know
I need to be on the team.

13:12.720 --> 13:15.359
No, you don't.
You're just a rookie.

13:15.520 --> 13:17.875
You got lucky on your
first little police case, man.

13:17.960 --> 13:19.871
That was the worst thing
to ever happen to you.

13:19.960 --> 13:21.473
Turned you into a monster.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.312
Now, you think you're
ready, but you're not.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.231
James, I am ready, man!

13:25.320 --> 13:26.309
That's why you need
to take me with you,

13:26.400 --> 13:28.640
so I can prove it to you, Lieutenant,
and everybody else.

13:28.720 --> 13:31.871
Whoa! You don't gotta prove nothing to me.
You almost got us killed.

13:31.960 --> 13:33.439
Don't let one
incident define me.

13:33.520 --> 13:35.238
You're really trying to say that
with a straight face?

13:35.320 --> 13:36.992
Do you wanna be responsible
for ruining my career?

13:37.080 --> 13:38.991
I don't care!
And you shouldn't either.

13:39.080 --> 13:40.513
You're getting
married in a week.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.720
You should stay here and help
Angela with the wedding.

13:43.200 --> 13:44.269
James, you said
it's a milk run.

13:44.360 --> 13:45.873
Two days, tops.
Those are your words.

13:45.960 --> 13:47.837
I can't go back to
marry Angela as no scrub.

13:47.920 --> 13:49.040
You told me to prove myself,

13:49.080 --> 13:50.760
that's what I'm trying to do!
Let me do it!

13:52.000 --> 13:53.353
Nope. You don't listen.

13:53.440 --> 13:55.476
James, what I'm...
Listen!

14:03.360 --> 14:05.510
It's bullshit, James.

14:05.960 --> 14:07.518
Not taking me to Miami.

14:07.600 --> 14:08.828
That's ridiculous, man.

14:08.920 --> 14:10.239
I am ready to
be a detective.

14:10.320 --> 14:12.117
I'm 100% ready
to be a detective.

14:12.600 --> 14:13.669
What's up, Black Hammer?

14:13.760 --> 14:15.591
Move, Assface.
I'm not in the mood right now.

14:15.680 --> 14:16.715
Y'all done made me mad.

14:16.800 --> 14:20.031
I'mma show Lieutenant Brooks.
Show all y'all.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.394
People, get out of my way!

14:21.480 --> 14:23.072
Right now,
I'm getting in my zone.

14:23.160 --> 14:24.229
I don't care.
You wanna chase me?

14:24.320 --> 14:26.120
I'mma show you what happens
when you chase me.

14:27.240 --> 14:28.753
That's what happen
when you make Ben mad.

14:28.840 --> 14:29.840
Spin out.

14:29.960 --> 14:31.313
Oh!

14:31.400 --> 14:32.515
And take it out.

14:32.640 --> 14:34.790
Yeah, I see a car I want.
Get out the car, Grandma.

14:34.880 --> 14:35.880
You need some help?

14:35.960 --> 14:37.916
Get your Bengay-using ass
out the car!

14:38.000 --> 14:39.433
Get your old ass
on that ground.

14:39.520 --> 14:40.589
This ain't a game to me.

14:40.720 --> 14:42.200
I just want the car.
I don't want you.

14:42.240 --> 14:43.275
Where'd she get the bat from?

14:43.400 --> 14:45.391
Grandma! Hey, hey...

14:45.520 --> 14:46.953
Oh. Oh!

14:47.040 --> 14:48.792
Oh! Oh!

14:49.000 --> 14:50.672
Oh, Grandma playing dirty.

14:50.760 --> 14:51.875
We turning it up now.

14:51.960 --> 14:53.757
What she doing?
She just pulled a gun out her ass!

14:53.840 --> 14:55.637
Grandma, it ain't even
got to go here.

14:55.960 --> 14:58.235
Oh! I just got shot
by a grandma!

14:58.320 --> 14:59.719
Game over.

14:59.800 --> 15:02.519
That is why I hired you, Cori.
You're the best.

15:02.600 --> 15:03.635
I know.

15:03.960 --> 15:05.598
We have
12 tables over here.

15:05.680 --> 15:08.148
If we put flower arrangements
at about half,

15:08.240 --> 15:10.879
and then we can do a vase
with crystal around it.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.240
I love it.
Cori?

15:13.400 --> 15:14.435
Ben.

15:15.440 --> 15:16.668
I didn't know we were
having a meeting today.

15:17.160 --> 15:18.593
I didn't get
that memo.

15:19.120 --> 15:20.189
We just thought
we could do some

15:20.280 --> 15:21.952
last-minute wedding
details, that's all.

15:22.040 --> 15:23.439
Oh.

15:24.080 --> 15:25.115
Without me?

15:25.520 --> 15:26.520
Huh.

15:27.600 --> 15:30.353
If that's the case, then I'll just...

15:32.400 --> 15:33.674
Listen from afar.

15:35.040 --> 15:37.474
- Thank you, Ben.
- Yep.

15:38.040 --> 15:39.837
I am so excited
to tell you,

15:39.920 --> 15:41.558
my associate
has the best

15:41.640 --> 15:44.359
hydrangea connection
in all of Atlanta.

15:44.600 --> 15:46.033
No.

15:47.480 --> 15:48.629
Now, for the
final seating chart,

15:48.760 --> 15:50.955
I've decided to move
everyone to Table Five,

15:51.040 --> 15:53.474
because I don't want anything
overshadowing your wedding.

15:53.560 --> 15:55.232
Perfect.
Table Five, that's the perfect table.

15:55.360 --> 15:56.998
No, we can't sit
them right there.

15:57.080 --> 15:58.115
We can't do that?
Why?

15:58.200 --> 16:00.589
We can't put my uncle and
Carol at the same table.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.119
They used to be
on that stuff together.

16:02.200 --> 16:03.792
You want all these people
Electric Sliding all night?

16:03.880 --> 16:04.880
That's what'll happen.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.638
Fine. I'll move him.

16:06.720 --> 16:09.393
Angela, no! You're
not moving anyone.

16:09.720 --> 16:10.948
Ben.

16:11.040 --> 16:12.393
You've had
your opportunities.

16:12.480 --> 16:14.072
And you've
ignored them all, Cori.

16:14.200 --> 16:15.269
Let me ask
you a question.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.351
Have you looked at my Dreamboard
that I posted online?

16:17.440 --> 16:19.351
Looked at my color wheel?
My glam shots?

16:19.440 --> 16:22.034
Why am I doing this?
Why am I going back and forth with you?

16:22.120 --> 16:23.120
This is my wedding!

16:23.240 --> 16:24.958
Okay. And I got
a vision for my wedding.

16:25.040 --> 16:28.271
A magnificent vision
that will not be ignored by you.

16:28.360 --> 16:29.429
She's not ignoring.

16:29.520 --> 16:31.556
No. Baby, she is ignoring it.
She hasn't addressed it.

16:31.640 --> 16:32.789
Excuse me?
Cori.

16:32.880 --> 16:34.154
Who are you walking
up on, all swelling up?

16:34.240 --> 16:36.390
Do you know the level
of who you're dealing with?

16:36.480 --> 16:38.948
I'm a First Ballot Hall of Famer.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.837
I crap out high-end clients.

16:40.920 --> 16:42.319
That's a little too much
information for me.

16:42.400 --> 16:43.549
And they
keep coming back.

16:43.640 --> 16:45.995
Why? Because I have taste.

16:46.080 --> 16:47.440
I'm not gonna do
this with you. No.

16:47.480 --> 16:49.391
Reason why is because I'm not...
What are you doing?

16:49.480 --> 16:50.640
Baby...
Baby, just help me up.

16:50.680 --> 16:52.591
I'm not intimidated
by you.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.995
I'm a cop.
Real badge. Authentic.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.433
What you gonna
do is respect it.

16:56.520 --> 16:59.353
Also respect the fact
that you are my employee!

16:59.440 --> 17:00.759
Your employee?
That's right.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.633
Don't you step...
Look, cop.

17:02.720 --> 17:05.553
What you need to do,
is you need to step the hell back

17:05.640 --> 17:08.358
and let me create
the wedding of your dreams!

17:08.440 --> 17:10.635
What I'm gonna do
is step up!

17:10.720 --> 17:11.914
No!
I'm sick of this shit!

17:14.760 --> 17:15.760
Ben...

17:17.400 --> 17:19.356
So, I guess we'll go
with my vision now.

17:19.440 --> 17:20.953
Get out of my house, Cori!

17:22.280 --> 17:25.875
Look, just let Cori do her job,
which is to plan the wedding.

17:25.960 --> 17:28.428
Cori's job should be
to show a little respect.

17:28.520 --> 17:31.671
I specifically told Cori,
I said, "No hydrangeas."

17:31.760 --> 17:34.035
And what does she show up here with?
Hydrangeas!

17:34.120 --> 17:35.519
I keep forgetting
that you're the bride.

17:35.600 --> 17:38.558
Why does nobody want
to show me respect!

17:38.680 --> 17:40.113
That's what
I wanna know, Ang.

17:45.480 --> 17:46.879
Oh, I respect you.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.718
Well, obviously not,
because we're sitting here

17:48.800 --> 17:50.677
talking about
my passion and...

17:52.640 --> 17:53.640
Wow!

17:53.680 --> 17:54.749
I respect that.

17:55.280 --> 17:56.349
I do.

17:56.760 --> 17:57.909
A lot.

17:58.080 --> 17:59.798
Practice run for
the wedding night?

18:00.240 --> 18:02.310
Yeah. I mean, we're here.

18:02.400 --> 18:03.674
I'm taking you
into custody.

18:05.480 --> 18:09.598
And we're going downtown.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.115
Well, I like that.

18:11.160 --> 18:12.752
Because of the play on words.
Uh-huh.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.353
Yeah. What are you...

18:14.440 --> 18:15.509
What is that?
What you trying to do?

18:15.640 --> 18:16.834
No, stop. Don't do that.

18:16.920 --> 18:19.275
No, no. Stop that. Stop.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.874
You have the right
to stay silent...

18:21.960 --> 18:23.757
You have the right
to "remain" silent...

18:23.840 --> 18:26.274
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything...

18:26.360 --> 18:27.839
Let me stop you right here, babe.
Just for a second.

18:27.960 --> 18:29.473
Because I want
you to Mirandize me.

18:29.560 --> 18:32.074
I want you to Mirandize
the hell out of me.

18:32.160 --> 18:34.276
But first, what I need to do,
I need to go in that bathroom,

18:34.360 --> 18:36.590
and wash all this
Atlanta crime off my butt.

18:36.680 --> 18:39.433
Now, when I'm done, I'mma come
out clean and give myself to the law.

18:39.520 --> 18:41.476
Take me.
Handcuff me to the bed.

18:41.560 --> 18:42.595
Mmm-hmm.
All right.

18:42.680 --> 18:43.680
Babe, put that baton down

18:43.760 --> 18:45.557
because if you break it,
I'mma have to pay for it.

18:45.640 --> 18:47.119
Whoo. What is going on
in my stomach?

18:47.200 --> 18:49.350
I gotta get in the bathroom.

18:51.400 --> 18:52.515
Okay.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.393
Hey, sis.
Everything okay?

18:57.240 --> 18:59.959
I need you to do something for me,
for the wedding.

19:00.040 --> 19:02.156
Look, if this is about me
not bringing a date...

19:02.240 --> 19:04.231
That's not what I'm
calling you about.

19:04.320 --> 19:08.393
I was wondering,
did you get me a gift for the wedding yet?

19:08.760 --> 19:10.398
Sound like you
want a favor.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.395
Ben really wants
to go to Miami.

19:14.480 --> 19:15.879
He told me you
wouldn't take him.

19:15.960 --> 19:18.269
Oh, hell, no. Are you crazy?
James,

19:18.360 --> 19:19.480
it would mean
so much to him.

19:19.520 --> 19:21.238
I don't care what
it'd mean to him.

19:21.320 --> 19:22.639
Look, is this about him,

19:22.720 --> 19:23.869
or is this about
you getting him

19:23.960 --> 19:25.234
out of your hair
for a few days?

19:25.320 --> 19:26.548
Ang!

19:26.640 --> 19:27.709
A little bit of both.

19:27.800 --> 19:28.835
No can do, sis.

19:28.920 --> 19:30.512
Look, you get
the dwarf a sedative.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.670
He's not going with me.
This is way too important.

19:32.760 --> 19:35.160
But, James, he just wants to prove himself.
The answer is no.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.595
Uh... Hello?

19:37.800 --> 19:40.109
This girl crazy.

19:40.240 --> 19:44.233
Now, why would you want me
to take this little flea to Miami?

19:44.320 --> 19:46.754
To show what kind
of a idiot he...

19:57.360 --> 19:58.429
Baby?

19:59.200 --> 20:00.553
Baby?
Yeah?

20:00.640 --> 20:02.676
The door.
Someone's at the door.

20:02.760 --> 20:05.115
All right.
They'll go away, Ang.

20:05.520 --> 20:08.273
No, they're not. They're not going away.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.195
I learned my lesson.
I didn't break in.

20:19.320 --> 20:20.389
I see that, James.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.630
At least, not this time.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.199
What are you wearing?

20:24.280 --> 20:25.952
Talking about
"what am I wearing?"

20:26.040 --> 20:28.793
It's called a kimono, James.
They make them for men.

20:28.880 --> 20:30.871
That's your problem.
You need to expand your horizons.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.228
All right, well,
just please

20:32.320 --> 20:34.151
don't bring this bullshit
to Miami with us.

20:34.240 --> 20:36.196
Well, I won't bring...

20:36.280 --> 20:37.395
Wait a minute, hold on.

20:37.720 --> 20:38.948
"Miami," James? I'm going?

20:39.320 --> 20:41.390
You taking me to Miami?
I'm leaving in five minutes.

20:41.480 --> 20:42.549
If you're going,
you better hurry up.

20:42.640 --> 20:43.959
Come here, man.

20:44.040 --> 20:45.314
All right.
No. It's too soon.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.118
Baby steps.
I'm okay with that.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.792
I knew you were
gonna change your mind.

20:48.880 --> 20:49.869
Because when
we were talking,

20:49.960 --> 20:52.269
you looked at me,
you were like...

20:54.160 --> 20:56.833
And I was like, "He's thinking about it."
You were mulling it over.

20:56.920 --> 20:58.956
God damn, I'm pumped up.

20:59.120 --> 21:00.189
Oh!

21:00.320 --> 21:02.993
Okay, this is
a little awkward, babe.

21:03.120 --> 21:04.120
Uh...

21:04.880 --> 21:06.996
James wants me to go away
with him for a couple days

21:07.080 --> 21:08.911
on official police business.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.160
I don't wanna go.

21:10.200 --> 21:12.509
I don't.
But James needs me.

21:12.600 --> 21:13.760
- Okay, yeah.
- Okay?

21:13.840 --> 21:15.751
Baby, do what you need to do.
Really?

21:15.840 --> 21:17.717
Yeah. Just make sure
you're back in time

21:17.800 --> 21:19.313
to make me Mrs. Black Hammer.

21:19.400 --> 21:22.790
What? Yes! Stop it. Of course!
I can't wait to get back.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.711
Because, as soon as I
get here, you and I,

21:24.800 --> 21:26.600
we are gonna marry
the hell out of each other.

21:26.720 --> 21:29.109
We're gonna marry our asses off.
Okay.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.269
Okay? Okay?
Give me three.

21:31.480 --> 21:33.550
I love you.
I love you. All right. You!

21:33.840 --> 21:37.549
Hey, what can I say?
You just... Miami! Oh.

21:38.120 --> 21:40.076
Hurry up!
I'm hurrying.

21:40.840 --> 21:42.990
Don't think I'm not grateful.
Mmm-hmm.

21:43.080 --> 21:45.230
But why did you
change your mind?

21:45.320 --> 21:47.629
Ben is never
gonna make Detective.

21:47.720 --> 21:49.233
And everybody on
the force knows this.

21:50.160 --> 21:53.869
But he thinks if he makes
this Miami run with me,

21:54.000 --> 21:55.558
that he'll prove us
all wrong.

21:55.640 --> 21:57.949
So, I'm taking him,
so he can see for himself.

21:58.040 --> 22:01.476
Because I don't wanna hear him
complaining for the rest of my life

22:01.560 --> 22:03.391
that I never
gave him a chance.

22:04.360 --> 22:07.238
You never know, he may surprise you.
I doubt it.

22:07.320 --> 22:08.992
He's done it before.
Beginner's luck.

22:09.080 --> 22:11.230
Oh. Okay.

22:11.320 --> 22:12.673
You'll be careful, right?

22:12.760 --> 22:13.988
Don't worry.

22:14.080 --> 22:15.399
I'll have your
little man-child

22:15.520 --> 22:16.748
back here safe and sound.

22:16.880 --> 22:18.154
Oh, he's all man.

22:18.240 --> 22:19.639
Hey, Ang?
Yeah, babe?

22:19.720 --> 22:20.960
You know
where my thong is?

22:21.040 --> 22:22.189
The silver, or the gold?

22:22.280 --> 22:23.680
I'm looking
for the silver one.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.069
Check my top-right drawer.
Wow.

22:26.240 --> 22:28.800
Don't mix up our thongs again, please.
I'm out.

22:28.880 --> 22:31.599
Oh, I got them.
They were in my panty drawer, not yours.

22:31.680 --> 22:33.238
- Thank you.
- You're welcome!

22:44.800 --> 22:45.800
Whoo! James!

22:54.720 --> 22:55.869
Look at this, man!

22:55.960 --> 22:57.279
James, do you see this?

22:57.360 --> 22:59.510
This is Miami!
This is the 305!

22:59.640 --> 23:01.198
Remember,
this ain't no vacation.

23:01.280 --> 23:03.510
First thing we gonna do
is go by Miami PD.

23:03.640 --> 23:04.789
Let them know we here.
Okay.

23:04.880 --> 23:06.552
You can't just slide
into somebody's backyard,

23:06.640 --> 23:09.712
start doing police work without
letting them know you in town.

23:09.800 --> 23:11.870
If that's the case, then we gotta stop
somewhere, so I can change.

23:11.960 --> 23:13.473
Why? What's the reason?

23:25.160 --> 23:26.957
This is just wrong.

23:27.280 --> 23:29.400
If linen is wrong, then I don't
wanna be right, James.

23:29.480 --> 23:30.993
You look like
you're in a damn cult.

23:31.080 --> 23:32.513
Does Tommy Bahama
run a cult?

23:32.640 --> 23:34.232
If so, good,
and where can I sign up?

23:34.320 --> 23:35.389
James, let me
tell you something.

23:35.480 --> 23:37.596
If we're gonna be a team,
you gotta start to coordinate.

23:37.680 --> 23:39.033
Listen to me, James!

23:39.120 --> 23:40.872
We gotta complement
each other, all right?

23:40.960 --> 23:42.916
I'm not trying to
compliment no marshmallow.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.991
A good detective knows
how to blend in with the locals,

23:45.080 --> 23:46.195
so his prey never
sees him coming.

23:46.320 --> 23:47.833
Oh, yeah,
you blending, all right.

23:48.520 --> 23:49.555
James, let me
tell you something,

23:49.640 --> 23:50.914
the right gust of
wind hit this thing,

23:51.000 --> 23:53.594
I'm giving you '90s P. Diddy.
Look at this, James.

24:03.360 --> 24:04.429
All right.
Wait here.

24:04.520 --> 24:05.589
Why I gotta wait here?

24:05.680 --> 24:07.398
Why you gotta talk?

24:09.880 --> 24:12.110
Detective,
I'm asking nicely.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.350
Please, I need a suspect.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.115
You're the Atlanta fella.

24:18.200 --> 24:20.395
Captain Pedro Hernandez.
Honored to meet you.

24:20.520 --> 24:21.953
Detective James Payton.

24:22.040 --> 24:23.359
We just wanted to
give you a heads-up.

24:23.480 --> 24:25.118
We're gonna be working
in your jurisdiction,

24:25.200 --> 24:26.633
questioning
a possible witness.

24:26.720 --> 24:28.199
Thanks
for the heads-up.

24:32.400 --> 24:33.674
What? Hydrangeas?

24:34.240 --> 24:35.240
Ugh.

24:43.560 --> 24:44.754
What's up with this?

24:44.840 --> 24:46.920
It's the Antonio Pope
Foundation's annual fundraiser.

24:47.160 --> 24:48.673
That's Antonio himself.

24:48.760 --> 24:49.988
He's a big donor.

24:50.080 --> 24:53.197
He owns one of the largest shipping
companies on the East Coast.

24:59.920 --> 25:01.273
Oh! What is your problem?

25:01.360 --> 25:02.429
You're at my desk.

25:02.560 --> 25:04.073
I'm sorry. I was looking at some
floral arrangements.

25:04.160 --> 25:06.594
Well, don't. Don't touch my computer.
Don't look at my computer.

25:06.680 --> 25:07.795
This stuff is sensitive.

25:07.880 --> 25:09.996
That is fine. I'll log out.
Oh, you're gonna log out?

25:10.320 --> 25:11.639
Oh! Girl...

25:11.720 --> 25:13.039
I said, don't touch!
Oh!

25:14.760 --> 25:17.228
It hurts, I know.
James? Oh!

25:17.920 --> 25:19.956
Soft-tissue manipulation.

25:20.080 --> 25:21.832
Pressure points.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.239
Come on, Ben, you should be able
to get out of that.

25:23.320 --> 25:26.118
She got my appendix, James.
She locked this whole side up.

25:26.240 --> 25:28.151
Can he get out of this?
Ooh!

25:28.240 --> 25:29.912
I don't know about that one.

25:30.760 --> 25:32.671
Whoa! Come on, Ben.
You're embarrassing me.

25:32.800 --> 25:33.949
- Man up.
- Yeah, you're embarrassing him.

25:34.040 --> 25:35.951
I tap out! I tap out!
You're pathetic.

25:36.040 --> 25:38.031
Detective Payton,
Atlanta Vice.

25:38.120 --> 25:41.078
Down here a couple
of days on assignment.

25:41.160 --> 25:42.957
Oh, my hat!
Detective Cruz. Homicide.

25:45.040 --> 25:47.713
And I'm Officer Ben Barber,
and I am his partner.

25:47.800 --> 25:49.153
No, he's not.

25:49.240 --> 25:50.680
I'm not shaking
your hand after that.

25:51.120 --> 25:52.792
Come on, James. Let's go.

25:52.880 --> 25:55.155
Before I have to bust her ass.
Let's go.

25:55.280 --> 25:57.840
Come on, James.
'Cause she's too much.

25:57.920 --> 25:59.200
I don't know
what her problem is.

26:12.600 --> 26:14.240
James, it's really cool
that you needed me

26:14.320 --> 26:15.389
to come down here
and all, man.

26:15.480 --> 26:17.072
But I feel bad,

26:17.160 --> 26:19.040
because I know you had to
cancel all your plans.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.155
What plans?

26:20.680 --> 26:21.749
My bachelor party.

26:21.840 --> 26:22.875
I didn't have
nothing planned.

26:22.960 --> 26:25.554
Yeah, right.
Boy, if you don't stop...

26:26.120 --> 26:29.112
Seriously, you didn't
have anything? Nothing?

26:30.240 --> 26:32.959
James, I'm not even
into that. Strippers and...

26:33.040 --> 26:35.508
I'm not trying to come home to the
Lady Hammer with glitter all on me.

26:35.600 --> 26:36.669
I'm not... Come on.

26:36.840 --> 26:38.432
Mmm-hmm.
Hey, on a more serious note,

26:38.520 --> 26:40.431
Angela need to know who
you're bringing to the wedding, James.

26:40.520 --> 26:44.593
Either Nicki Minaj
or Patti LaBelle.

26:44.680 --> 26:46.600
You know what you're doing?
You're road-blocking.

26:46.640 --> 26:48.392
That's what you're doing, man.
You're road-blocking.

26:48.480 --> 26:49.993
You're still
holding onto something.

26:50.080 --> 26:51.080
I know what it is.

26:51.200 --> 26:53.953
You're afraid that when me and
Angela go sail off into the sunset,

26:54.040 --> 26:55.473
that you're
gonna be by yourself.

26:55.560 --> 26:56.549
But here's the thing, James.

26:56.640 --> 26:59.234
You can sail off into the sunset
with me and Angela.

26:59.360 --> 27:00.480
After the honeymoon, though.

27:00.520 --> 27:04.559
You can't go there. 'Cause that's
when me and Angela gets busy.

27:04.640 --> 27:07.837
If you say that one more time,
I'mma shoot you in the face.

27:07.920 --> 27:09.717
Again, it doesn't bother me.

27:09.800 --> 27:11.711
You know why, James?
Because it's just banter.

27:11.800 --> 27:12.800
Is that right?

27:12.880 --> 27:14.950
It's a trademark of all great partnerships,
to be honest with you.

27:15.040 --> 27:17.873
No, no. It's a trademark
of the brothers-in-law.

27:18.320 --> 27:19.514
Uh-oh!

27:19.600 --> 27:21.477
Guess who just showed up?

27:21.560 --> 27:22.629
The brothers-in-law.

27:22.720 --> 27:24.597
Look, look, look, man.
That ain't gonna fly.

27:24.720 --> 27:25.720
One more, one more.

27:25.800 --> 27:29.429
Everybody settle down! Because the
brothers-in-law just got to town.

27:29.520 --> 27:31.636
You say that again,
and I'mma shoot you in the face, too.

27:31.720 --> 27:32.755
Say...

27:34.520 --> 27:35.520
You...

27:36.240 --> 27:37.753
All right, fine.

27:46.320 --> 27:47.389
Oh, you funny.

27:47.480 --> 27:48.833
It's gonna stick.

27:57.520 --> 27:58.839
All right.

28:00.360 --> 28:02.920
How you wanna handle
this whole thing with AJ?

28:03.000 --> 28:05.594
Wanna do Good Cop-Bad Cop?
Prisoner's Dilemma?

28:05.680 --> 28:07.477
Why don't you leave that by-the-book
shit at the academy?

28:07.560 --> 28:10.393
We're gonna assess the situation
and play it on instincts.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.357
My instincts.
With all due respect,

28:12.440 --> 28:13.714
I really feel like we should do
the Reid technique.

28:13.800 --> 28:14.869
Okay? I done studied it.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.793
Why don't we try the "Ben, shut the hell up"
technique, all right?

28:17.880 --> 28:19.359
Let's run that all day.

28:19.520 --> 28:20.589
AJ, open up!

28:21.720 --> 28:23.160
I'm gonna go check
around the window.

28:30.360 --> 28:32.715
Hey! Police!
Stop! You better stop!

28:32.800 --> 28:34.950
James! He running!

28:35.040 --> 28:36.917
That's a foot chase!
Don't say foot...

28:37.960 --> 28:40.758
It's a foot chase!
It's a foot chase, James!

28:40.840 --> 28:41.840
Stop right there!

28:41.920 --> 28:43.239
You ain't gotta
say "Foot chase!"

28:43.320 --> 28:44.355
Stop!
Hey!

28:44.440 --> 28:45.668
Relax!

28:45.760 --> 28:47.352
James! I'm okay!

28:49.400 --> 28:50.628
What'd I say?

28:52.480 --> 28:53.879
Police! Stop!

28:54.640 --> 28:56.153
Slow down!

28:58.280 --> 28:59.280
Police, stop!

28:59.600 --> 29:03.275
Hey! Stop! Stop! Stop!

29:04.440 --> 29:05.759
Police!

29:07.080 --> 29:08.672
Goddamn rookie.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.313
Enjoy your barbecue!

29:15.440 --> 29:16.998
Get down! I see you! Stop!

29:26.200 --> 29:27.269
God.

29:27.680 --> 29:29.272
Police, stop!

29:29.360 --> 29:30.918
That's it!
I'mma shoot you!

29:35.520 --> 29:37.636
AJ! AJ! Don't you jump...

29:39.680 --> 29:41.796
Damn it! AJ!

29:49.760 --> 29:51.239
Oh! I got you, AJ!

29:53.560 --> 29:54.629
God damn it, I missed.

29:56.480 --> 29:58.198
You'll be okay.
It doesn't look that bad!

29:58.280 --> 30:00.032
AJ, get your ass... AJ!

30:02.600 --> 30:03.635
AJ!

30:08.040 --> 30:10.759
Get your little...
Get in the back room!

30:14.040 --> 30:16.554
Stop! Stop! Stop!

30:18.760 --> 30:20.910
Stop! Stop!

30:21.080 --> 30:22.718
Oh, shit!

30:24.400 --> 30:26.038
Heel! Heel!

30:28.480 --> 30:29.799
Police!

30:34.320 --> 30:36.151
Stop it! God damn it!

30:41.400 --> 30:43.356
Shit! God damn. Shit!

30:44.840 --> 30:46.831
Get out of here! Get out!

30:56.600 --> 30:58.079
Oh, AJ.

30:58.880 --> 30:59.915
You okay, man?

31:00.000 --> 31:01.513
Damn, I didn't see you.

31:01.600 --> 31:03.158
It's all right,
this is my friend.

31:03.240 --> 31:05.151
We just playing, like...
He's okay.

31:05.240 --> 31:06.593
We just playing.

31:06.680 --> 31:08.352
What's up, Bone Machine?
What the hell you running from?

31:08.440 --> 31:09.873
What the hell, man?
Why you chasing me?

31:09.960 --> 31:11.029
Why you running
from the police?

31:11.120 --> 31:12.678
I didn't know
you were police!

31:12.760 --> 31:14.955
You didn't hear us say
"Stop. We the police"?

31:15.080 --> 31:16.274
Hey. I didn't see a badge.

31:16.400 --> 31:19.790
All I saw was two
mean-looking blaentlemen.

31:20.480 --> 31:21.480
"Blentlemen?"

31:21.560 --> 31:23.760
That ain't even a word, AJ.
What you trying to say, man?

31:23.800 --> 31:25.119
Just forget about it.
Say what you mean.

31:25.200 --> 31:27.031
Have some balls! Say it!

31:27.960 --> 31:30.269
Okay. Black.

31:30.560 --> 31:33.632
You ran from us
just because we black?

31:34.040 --> 31:35.473
Look at you.

31:35.960 --> 31:38.235
You would run
from you. Okay?

31:39.160 --> 31:41.390
Look, all we wanna do
is talk to you, AJ.

31:41.480 --> 31:43.391
You, and your son
over there,

31:43.480 --> 31:45.038
should be ashamed
of yourselves

31:45.120 --> 31:46.439
for trying to
intimidate me!

31:46.520 --> 31:47.714
You can't
hear me calling you?

31:47.840 --> 31:49.034
Got me running
after you in flats?

31:49.120 --> 31:50.394
Ben? What
are you doing?

31:50.480 --> 31:53.119
He got me running through alleyways!
People's houses!

31:53.200 --> 31:55.589
Chasing you through chicken
coops and dogs and shit!

31:55.680 --> 31:56.715
In flats, James!

31:56.800 --> 31:58.840
Look at my outfit. I can't
get another one of these.

31:59.320 --> 32:00.389
Where's my hat at?
Hey! Hey! Hey!

32:00.560 --> 32:03.074
Come here. Stay focused.
Stay focused! A'ight.

32:03.160 --> 32:05.435
Let me show you
how a real detective handles this.

32:06.720 --> 32:07.835
Damn.

32:08.480 --> 32:09.480
AJ.

32:10.160 --> 32:12.355
Look, man,
all we trying to do

32:12.520 --> 32:14.238
is have a little
conversation

32:14.320 --> 32:15.600
about your boy,
Troy, in Atlanta.

32:15.680 --> 32:16.715
Troy who?

32:17.960 --> 32:19.837
You just encrypted
a drive for Troy.

32:20.240 --> 32:23.437
"Troy?" It doesn't ring a bell.
I don't know any Troy.

32:23.520 --> 32:25.988
It don't ring a bell?
No, it does not.

32:26.120 --> 32:28.429
I'm taking your ass to jail.
Come on, man!

32:28.520 --> 32:31.557
Until you let me know what's on
that little secret drive of Troy's,

32:31.640 --> 32:32.914
your ass is locked up.

32:33.040 --> 32:35.873
Hey, my word is my rep.
And this is oppression.

32:35.960 --> 32:37.632
Get your ass in there.

32:40.320 --> 32:41.992
Why you looking
so nervous, AJ?

32:42.080 --> 32:43.274
Why your legs so twitchy?

32:43.360 --> 32:44.475
Got restless leg syndrome.

32:44.560 --> 32:46.200
Your legs won't rest
when you get to jail.

32:46.360 --> 32:48.828
As a matter of fact,
they gonna be working overtime

32:48.920 --> 32:51.070
to keep them
"blentlemen" off your back.

32:51.200 --> 32:53.481
Last thing they're gonna do
with your ass is be "blentle."

32:54.000 --> 32:55.592
That's the last thing they gonna do.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

32:55.680 --> 32:58.877
I am not a criminal, and you know that!
This is not fair!

32:58.960 --> 33:01.110
It's not fair?
Well, welcome to the real world, AJ.

33:01.200 --> 33:03.156
I'm sorry, but it's not fair here.
You know why?

33:03.240 --> 33:04.798
It's a world where your
feelings can get hurt.

33:04.920 --> 33:06.273
It's a world where
a guy can get married

33:06.360 --> 33:07.588
and not be thrown
a bachelor party.

33:07.680 --> 33:09.033
That's the world we...
You getting married?

33:09.120 --> 33:11.395
Yes. Thank you.
Congratulations.

33:11.480 --> 33:13.835
This guy here is about
to be my brother, in law.

33:13.920 --> 33:14.909
My brother-in-law.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

33:15.000 --> 33:17.753
Your partner is
marrying your sister?

33:17.840 --> 33:19.239
He's not
my partner.

33:19.320 --> 33:20.389
That's gotta be weird.

33:20.480 --> 33:22.152
It's not weird at all.
It's actually magical.

33:22.240 --> 33:23.309
Brings us closer together.

33:23.400 --> 33:24.469
- Ben.
- What?

33:24.560 --> 33:25.560
Stay focused.

33:25.600 --> 33:27.040
What makes you think
I'm not focused?

33:27.080 --> 33:28.149
Let me ask you a question.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.468
Go ahead.

33:29.560 --> 33:31.790
- Your girl. His sister.
- Yeah.

33:31.880 --> 33:32.915
Is she hefty?

33:34.360 --> 33:36.590
I hope she's not a twin,
all bearded and grumpy.

33:36.680 --> 33:38.636
Oh. Oh, no,
they don't look alike.

33:38.720 --> 33:39.994
My whole point is,

33:40.120 --> 33:42.793
your partner marrying your sister
has got to be tough on you.

33:43.240 --> 33:45.435
The sex part.
Think about it.

33:45.520 --> 33:47.829
Your partner, boning...

33:47.960 --> 33:50.076
No, we don't bone.
We don't... your sister.

33:50.160 --> 33:51.479
Don't... That's not...

33:51.560 --> 33:52.560
No.
Mmm.

33:52.640 --> 33:55.108
- AJ, you better cool out.
- Me so horny.

33:56.880 --> 33:57.880
Jeez!

33:58.000 --> 33:59.991
- Been there.
- I think you broke my nose.

34:01.720 --> 34:02.994
That's a lawsuit right there!

34:03.080 --> 34:05.674
You just made me
a very rich man!

34:05.760 --> 34:07.000
Can't spend no
money in the pen.

34:07.080 --> 34:08.513
No.
Or dead.

34:09.080 --> 34:11.799
What's it gonna be?
Okay, okay.

34:11.880 --> 34:14.952
I may have a master code key

34:15.040 --> 34:16.678
for emergencies.
You "may"?

34:16.840 --> 34:17.909
Okay, I do have one,

34:18.000 --> 34:19.513
but it's too dangerous
to keep on me.

34:20.280 --> 34:21.871
I keep it in my man
Stevie B's safe.

34:21.960 --> 34:23.109
Where's the safe?

34:24.040 --> 34:25.109
It's at the club he owns.

34:25.639 --> 34:27.870
Tell you what,
I get that for you,

34:28.000 --> 34:30.070
you can crack Troy's computer,
and we're good.

34:30.159 --> 34:32.120
What do you think? Sound
like a plan to me, James.

34:40.080 --> 34:41.592
Have you been watching this?
What?

34:41.679 --> 34:44.478
Since we walked in,
everybody he walk by, handshake or hug.

34:44.600 --> 34:46.272
Hey, Candi!
Hi, sweetie.

34:46.360 --> 34:47.952
How are you?
Fine.

34:48.040 --> 34:49.074
Usual table?
Mmm-hmm.

34:49.159 --> 34:53.676
And, please, tell the guys
that midnight is coming early tonight.

34:53.760 --> 34:54.987
Yes, sir.
All right.

35:02.840 --> 35:04.751
Oh, I know that look.

35:04.840 --> 35:07.115
"How come the nerd is
with all the hotties?"

35:07.200 --> 35:10.749
Well, anyway,
Stevie B's gonna be here in an hour, tops.

35:10.840 --> 35:12.432
And you said you didn't get
a bachelor party.

35:12.520 --> 35:15.956
And we are in
a club with ladies.

35:16.040 --> 35:19.271
And we are on official
police business, so...

35:19.360 --> 35:21.669
You want to look like cops?
Think about it.

35:21.760 --> 35:23.591
- Maybe scare my guy off?
- Now, listen,

35:23.680 --> 35:25.760
James, I hate to agree with AJ,
but he's got a point.

35:25.800 --> 35:26.835
Loosen up a little bit.

35:26.920 --> 35:28.672
Yeah! Hoo!

35:28.760 --> 35:29.829
Hey, where you going?

35:29.920 --> 35:31.990
I'mma get some
drinks, man. Chillax.

35:32.080 --> 35:33.195
What is your problem?

35:33.360 --> 35:35.191
If he wanna go and get us
a couple of drinks, let him!

35:35.320 --> 35:36.912
He is working you
like a rookie.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.558
And if you lose him,
it's your fault.

35:38.640 --> 35:40.710
Stop it. You don't
think I know that?

35:40.800 --> 35:42.028
Here's the play, James.

35:42.160 --> 35:44.390
We sit here until
his friend gets here.

35:44.480 --> 35:47.552
We act as if this is a bachelor party.
Let him get loose,

35:47.640 --> 35:49.756
get the information we need,
and then we leave.

35:49.840 --> 35:52.513
Key word is "act!"
That's what you're doing?

35:52.600 --> 35:53.999
I'm acting!

35:54.880 --> 35:57.235
It's my bachelor party!

36:10.080 --> 36:12.674
I got you!
I got him!

36:12.760 --> 36:14.034
One more time!

36:14.480 --> 36:17.756
One more time!
One more time!

36:24.720 --> 36:25.720
Oh!

36:25.800 --> 36:26.800
Oh, wait a minute.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.393
What's happening,
Black Hammer?

36:28.480 --> 36:29.515
Assface!

36:29.600 --> 36:30.669
Hey!
What?

36:30.760 --> 36:32.239
What are you doing?
I'm Skyping in

36:32.320 --> 36:33.389
the rest of
the bachelor party, James!

36:33.480 --> 36:34.754
Get off the table!

36:35.000 --> 36:36.149
I'm acting.

36:37.240 --> 36:39.879
Ben, I want you to
meet my new lady friends.

36:39.960 --> 36:41.837
They love to get
loose and party,

36:41.920 --> 36:44.036
but they are not prostitutes.

36:44.120 --> 36:45.473
It's his bachelor party.

36:45.560 --> 36:46.879
Let it rip.

36:46.960 --> 36:48.279
No, that's
too much, ladies.

36:48.360 --> 36:49.360
Hands off.

36:49.440 --> 36:51.112
Hey, Ben, take
a photo for me.

36:51.200 --> 36:52.872
Okay. One, two...

36:52.960 --> 36:54.880
I can't breathe no more.
I can't breathe no more.

36:54.960 --> 36:56.000
I got it.

37:00.480 --> 37:01.515
Go ahead.

37:02.840 --> 37:04.876
Ang is such a strong woman.

37:04.960 --> 37:07.758
And I don't wanna give her
anything that's girly or ratchet.

37:07.840 --> 37:11.310
Nobody's information is safe,
unless AJ makes it safe.

37:12.920 --> 37:14.319
AJ.
Hey.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.356
Where is Stevie B?
We need to find him!

37:16.440 --> 37:17.440
You're ruining
my clothes.

37:17.520 --> 37:19.033
I'm sick of
waiting on you.

37:19.120 --> 37:21.076
We gotta toast
the groom. Toast!

37:21.160 --> 37:22.639
Toast! Toast!

37:22.800 --> 37:24.438
Toast! Toast! Toast!

37:24.520 --> 37:26.760
I mean, would it kill you to say
something nice about me?

37:27.720 --> 37:29.199
You want a toast?
Yes!

37:29.280 --> 37:30.395
All right,
give me my water.

37:30.480 --> 37:31.754
Here!

37:31.840 --> 37:33.680
I've never gotten him to do
anything like this.

37:33.720 --> 37:35.790
Come on.
Let's hear it!

37:35.880 --> 37:38.997
To my brother-in-law,
Benjamin Barber. That's me.

37:39.080 --> 37:40.593
He's 5'4".

37:40.680 --> 37:42.750
Uh... Gonna
marry my sister.

37:42.840 --> 37:44.717
Just graduated
from the academy.

37:44.800 --> 37:46.358
You're not doing anything,
but stating facts.

37:46.440 --> 37:47.839
Give me something
from the heart!

37:47.920 --> 37:49.433
That's all I got.

37:49.520 --> 37:50.794
We ain't even
here for this!

37:50.880 --> 37:52.757
Guys, do you know
what time it is?

37:53.200 --> 37:56.988
It's midnight!
Midnight!

37:58.440 --> 38:00.158
Bachelor party!

38:09.680 --> 38:11.193
What?
He's gone!

38:12.920 --> 38:13.989
Excuse me, ladies!

38:14.520 --> 38:15.555
Shit!

38:16.200 --> 38:17.872
I'll give the money back!
I swear!

38:18.120 --> 38:19.189
Ow!

38:19.280 --> 38:20.679
Easy, dude!

38:20.920 --> 38:22.956
Gun!

38:30.400 --> 38:31.435
Freeze!

38:34.360 --> 38:35.475
Everybody down!

38:35.560 --> 38:36.595
Down! Get down!

38:37.000 --> 38:39.230
Get up, AJ!
Get your ass up!

38:46.720 --> 38:48.392
James, why is it that every time
I go to a club with you,

38:48.480 --> 38:49.469
I gotta get into
some kind of trouble?

38:49.560 --> 38:50.709
It's probably that jacket.

38:50.800 --> 38:53.360
He's shooting a FN 5.7, James!
That gun is serious!

38:53.440 --> 38:54.760
I'mma push him back.
Don't go now.

38:55.920 --> 38:56.920
Too many people!

38:57.000 --> 38:58.513
Told you not to go!

38:58.600 --> 39:00.397
Thirteen, 14.

39:00.480 --> 39:01.754
What are you counting?
He's out!

39:09.320 --> 39:10.389
Everybody, stay down!

39:10.480 --> 39:11.993
Stay down!

39:13.640 --> 39:14.709
AJ.

39:20.200 --> 39:21.269
What?

39:21.720 --> 39:22.755
He's gone.

39:26.200 --> 39:27.519
Hey.

39:27.600 --> 39:30.114
There was no "code key"
in the damn safe.

39:30.560 --> 39:32.198
AJ played us.

39:33.480 --> 39:34.754
You okay?

39:35.360 --> 39:37.749
No. No, I am not.

39:37.840 --> 39:39.160
Let me ask you
a serious question.

39:39.840 --> 39:41.193
Maybe you not
cut out for this.

39:41.280 --> 39:43.236
That's not a question.
That's a statement.

39:43.320 --> 39:45.959
You know what? You was having such
a good time at your bachelor party,

39:46.040 --> 39:47.040
you wasn't even ready.

39:47.120 --> 39:48.120
Okay, James,
first of all,

39:48.200 --> 39:49.428
don't act like
I wanted to go to this club,

39:49.520 --> 39:52.159
and stand on tables,
and party with a bunch of hot women.

39:53.160 --> 39:55.240
That didn't come out right.
So, I'm gonna start over.

40:03.400 --> 40:04.549
Oh, my God.

40:04.640 --> 40:06.915
Detective by day, hottie by night.
What the hell's going on?

40:07.000 --> 40:09.514
Well, I'll tell you what's not going on,
a Pilates class.

40:09.600 --> 40:11.520
I dunno what you're dressed for,
but it's stupid.

40:12.240 --> 40:13.240
What happened?

40:13.320 --> 40:17.393
One shooter. Obviously a professional.
Went right after AJ.

40:17.480 --> 40:18.515
Who the hell is AJ?

40:18.600 --> 40:20.989
AJ's the hacker that we
came out here to question.

40:21.160 --> 40:23.435
Now, your guys think
it's gang related.

40:23.520 --> 40:24.794
I say that's bullshit.

40:24.880 --> 40:26.518
Because you're
an expert on local gangs?

40:26.600 --> 40:28.238
No, I'm an expert
on bullshit.

40:28.360 --> 40:30.271
Well, expert,
how'd he get the gun in?

40:30.360 --> 40:31.360
Gun was ceramic.

40:32.080 --> 40:34.469
Or plastic. I saw it.
It was a FN 5.7.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.430
It's undetectable. It's a downloadable
super pack in my video game.

40:37.520 --> 40:40.830
Let me tell you something,
you get that pack, game over! Okay...

40:41.240 --> 40:42.832
That's how he
got the gun in.

40:44.560 --> 40:46.073
The case I'm
working on right now,

40:46.160 --> 40:48.037
shooter got a gun
inside of a secured area.

40:48.120 --> 40:49.348
And get this,

40:50.040 --> 40:54.431
the threads on the bullet matched
the casings of an FN 5.7.

40:54.520 --> 40:56.511
Same M.O. Could be
the same shooter.

40:56.640 --> 40:58.198
Who was shot?
Port Commissioner.

40:59.600 --> 41:01.120
Could be connected.
Could be connected.

41:03.360 --> 41:05.112
Ugh. It's like
watching rams mate.

41:05.200 --> 41:08.272
Why would somebody hire
a professional hitman

41:08.400 --> 41:10.311
to take out a computer guy

41:10.400 --> 41:12.152
for a mid-level
Atlanta dealer?

41:12.280 --> 41:13.349
Because he's annoying.

41:13.440 --> 41:16.079
If that was the case,
you'd be dead a long time ago.

41:16.200 --> 41:17.200
I'm just spit-balling.

41:17.280 --> 41:18.599
Fact is, he wouldn't.

41:18.680 --> 41:19.999
So, the guy who hit
the Port Commissioner

41:20.120 --> 41:22.714
is the same guy who
tried to hit your hacker.

41:22.800 --> 41:24.791
Maybe he's involved
with something bigger.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
You know what?

41:27.080 --> 41:28.880
She should be your "plus one"
for the wedding.

41:28.960 --> 41:30.560
You know what?
You should get in the car.

41:30.680 --> 41:32.477
I need to get somebody for you.
You need to get in the car.

41:32.560 --> 41:34.755
You wanna just have an empty plate there...
I'm getting in the car.

41:34.840 --> 41:37.149
I'm not gonna keep doing this with you.
There's so much disrespect.

41:37.240 --> 41:38.912
I mean, what's
funny to me, James...

41:39.000 --> 41:40.991
The plastic gun,
I detected that.

41:41.080 --> 41:42.593
But you don't say nothing
about that, do you?

41:42.680 --> 41:44.000
A professional hitter
on a hacker?

41:44.080 --> 41:45.229
Club full of witnesses?

41:45.320 --> 41:46.760
And I'm driving.
No, you're not.

41:46.840 --> 41:48.159
Uh, I'm in
the driver's seat, James,

41:48.240 --> 41:49.240
which means I'm driving.

41:49.360 --> 41:50.475
Give me my keys.

41:50.560 --> 41:51.959
Why's your car
smell like burnt toast?

41:52.040 --> 41:53.678
Because this stinks.

41:53.760 --> 41:54.875
That's not toast.

41:54.960 --> 41:56.359
Ben, get the hell
out of the car.

41:56.440 --> 41:58.590
Get off my neck!
Get off me!

42:13.000 --> 42:14.797
You guys okay?

42:20.280 --> 42:22.714
Do you have any idea what your
insurance is gonna be?

42:22.800 --> 42:24.631
That's the second car
you done got blown up!

42:24.720 --> 42:25.920
It's gonna go
through the roof!

42:27.040 --> 42:28.359
Police are no
closer to a suspect

42:28.480 --> 42:30.869
in the shocking murder
of Port Commissioner Douglas Griffin.

42:30.960 --> 42:32.632
And, although
the investigation continues,

42:32.720 --> 42:34.392
the city has wasted
no time in appointing

42:34.480 --> 42:35.754
Charles NuÃ±ez
as his successor.

42:35.840 --> 42:38.035
I will carry on my
predecessor's mission

42:38.120 --> 42:41.032
to eradicate corruption
and clean up the port,

42:41.160 --> 42:42.878
no matter the cost!

42:44.480 --> 42:45.708
No sign of him at the house.

42:45.800 --> 42:48.712
He's not going back to the house.
He's a wanted man.

42:48.800 --> 42:50.916
Look, whoever's after AJ,
really needs to get to him.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.760
Even if that means
killing you guys to do it.

42:53.640 --> 42:54.868
Guys, guys, guys.

42:56.080 --> 42:57.399
I'm a little disappointed.

42:57.480 --> 43:00.233
Since you've been here
I've had a night club shooting downtown,

43:00.320 --> 43:02.038
I've fielded about

43:02.120 --> 43:04.475
20 trespassing complaints
in Little Havana

43:05.160 --> 43:06.559
and a freaking car blew up.

43:06.680 --> 43:08.000
Hey, we didn't
plant the car bomb.

43:08.040 --> 43:09.996
Yeah, but we did
the other stuff, James.

43:10.080 --> 43:12.320
Listen, I spoke
to your lieutenant in Atlanta,

43:12.360 --> 43:14.157
and he'd love it
if you went home.

43:15.120 --> 43:16.872
Happy travels, guys.

43:17.400 --> 43:20.040
Happy travels, my ass. We ain't
going nowhere.

43:21.240 --> 43:22.958
Answer that phone.
It's not my phone.

43:23.040 --> 43:26.032
It's in your pocket.
Ain't no phone in...

43:26.120 --> 43:27.348
There is a phone
in my pocket.

43:28.280 --> 43:29.280
It's AJ's phone.

43:29.360 --> 43:30.918
I never gave AJ
back his phone.

43:31.080 --> 43:33.275
Look, the phone's
being going off the last couple of hours.

43:33.360 --> 43:37.273
I mean, there's texts in here
from Tasha, Bree, Colette...

43:37.360 --> 43:39.032
First of all,
AJ is a slore.

43:39.160 --> 43:40.673
Why don't we do this?
I'mma call Tasha right now.

43:40.760 --> 43:43.280
No, that's gonna raise a red flag.
See if she got a work number.

43:45.480 --> 43:47.516
"Tasha, work." That's good thinking, James.
I know.

43:47.600 --> 43:49.238
Well, I'm just telling you.
You don't got to tell me.

43:49.320 --> 43:50.833
I should, you did a good...
Just call.

43:50.920 --> 43:52.114
You know what your
problem is, Maya?

43:52.200 --> 43:53.838
You think you're cute,
but you're not.

43:53.920 --> 43:54.989
You're ugly.

43:55.720 --> 43:57.199
And you got man hands.

43:59.760 --> 44:02.320
Beach Kitten of South
Beach, open seven days a week...

44:02.520 --> 44:03.520
Blam-a-lam-bam!

44:03.600 --> 44:04.919
Guess we're
going to Tasha's job.

44:05.000 --> 44:06.069
I took this from your car.

44:06.160 --> 44:07.434
I'm gonna go see
my explosives guy.

44:07.520 --> 44:09.520
Maybe he can tell us
what kind of ordinance it was.

44:10.240 --> 44:12.117
Damn, that's what left
of your trunk, James.

44:12.240 --> 44:14.390
They got you good.
Yeah, we're gonna need a new ride.

44:14.560 --> 44:16.869
Oh. I can
help you with that.

44:18.080 --> 44:19.149
Oh, I gotta tell Angela.

44:19.240 --> 44:22.038
Man, don't tell her what we driving.
I feel like a dope dealer.

44:22.120 --> 44:24.156
Stop it. This is the best car
from the impound lot.

44:24.240 --> 44:25.480
Hello?

44:25.520 --> 44:26.999
Hey, baby.
Hey.

44:27.080 --> 44:28.991
Guess what I call me and James?
What?

44:29.080 --> 44:31.150
Don't.
The brothers-in-law!

44:31.280 --> 44:32.998
I love it.
Man, don't say that no more.

44:33.080 --> 44:35.150
So, Ben, I don't
have to worry about

44:35.240 --> 44:36.719
not seeing you
on Saturday, right?

44:36.800 --> 44:37.835
Babe, I'll be home,
waiting for the wedding.

44:37.920 --> 44:38.909
You're finishing things up?

44:39.000 --> 44:40.069
I just got a lead,

44:40.160 --> 44:42.310
so we're about to crack
this thing wide open.

44:42.400 --> 44:43.674
Well, you do that

44:43.760 --> 44:45.751
and everything's all right, here.
We've got it all covered.

44:45.920 --> 44:47.717
"We?" Ang, is Cori
over there?

44:47.800 --> 44:49.074
Is that Ben?
Let me talk to him.

44:49.160 --> 44:50.440
- No, don't put her...
- Ben, hi!

44:50.520 --> 44:54.752
What kind of man leaves town
a week before the wedding?

44:54.920 --> 44:56.672
A detective man!
You're not a detective.

44:56.760 --> 44:58.079
I'm not gonna shout
with you right now.

44:58.160 --> 44:59.149
You know what
you're gonna do?

44:59.240 --> 45:00.559
You're gonna respect
my choices, Cori.

45:00.640 --> 45:01.868
You gotta earn
respect from me.

45:01.960 --> 45:04.155
I don't understand
why you gotta keep going off-menu.

45:04.240 --> 45:06.834
Because your menu
is dog shit!

45:06.920 --> 45:08.478
Menu is not dog...
Yes, it is, Ben.

45:08.600 --> 45:10.875
That's why I put my dreambook
on Pinterest for you.

45:10.960 --> 45:12.880
So you can look at it...
Pinterest this! Goodbye.

45:14.240 --> 45:15.275
Cori?

45:16.200 --> 45:17.200
Cori?

45:17.480 --> 45:20.119
I can't believe she
just hung up on me.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.640
You know your biggest problem?
Here we go.

45:25.720 --> 45:27.278
You don't know
how to stay focused.

45:27.360 --> 45:28.713
I'm going through
a little crisis

45:28.800 --> 45:30.756
and it'd be real nice to get
a little support from my brother.

45:30.840 --> 45:32.432
You ain't got
no brother.

45:32.520 --> 45:34.954
Okay, what do you call the guy that's
about to marry your sister, James?

45:35.040 --> 45:36.553
Not my brother.
Hey.

45:36.640 --> 45:38.358
That would be incest,
and that would be nasty.

45:38.440 --> 45:39.509
You're twisting stuff.

45:39.600 --> 45:41.795
You twist things because you
don't have the ability to love, James.

45:41.880 --> 45:42.880
That's your problem.

45:42.960 --> 45:44.518
I'll prove it to you right now.
Let me take the lead.

45:44.640 --> 45:46.312
I'll show you I could be a detective.
Hell, no.

45:46.400 --> 45:47.549
Tell me why.

45:47.680 --> 45:49.875
This girl's probably not even
gonna wanna talk to us in public,

45:49.960 --> 45:52.428
so it's not gonna be a good look
if you get all screechy,

45:52.560 --> 45:53.595
or you accidentally
shoot the girl.

45:53.680 --> 45:55.079
Why can't you let
the past be the past?

45:55.160 --> 45:56.240
You can't even handle Cori!

45:56.320 --> 45:57.639
She's irrelevant right now.

45:57.720 --> 45:59.676
The girl is the devil's
spawn with lady parts.

45:59.760 --> 46:01.955
Look, I'm taking the lead
because I'm the detective.

46:02.120 --> 46:03.314
Fine.

46:03.680 --> 46:05.955
It's like I'm
dealing with a child.

46:06.600 --> 46:08.272
Oh, my God.

46:08.360 --> 46:10.271
James, do you see this?
Yep.

46:10.360 --> 46:11.759
It's like
a Costco for supermodels.

46:11.840 --> 46:12.840
Look at this.

46:12.920 --> 46:15.195
James? Look up!
She's like a dolphin.

46:15.280 --> 46:16.633
Hey, stay focused.
I'm focused, James.

46:16.720 --> 46:19.188
At the same time, I'm not.
Look at this.

46:19.920 --> 46:22.354
Hello.

46:23.240 --> 46:25.037
Can I help you?
Yep.

46:25.720 --> 46:26.835
Where's Tasha?

46:26.920 --> 46:28.558
Um, okay,
just give me a second.

46:28.680 --> 46:30.113
I gotta get her
from the back.

46:30.200 --> 46:31.200
- Tasha?
- Yeah?

46:31.280 --> 46:33.000
There's two police officers
here to see you.

46:33.040 --> 46:34.598
All right.
Thanks.

46:34.680 --> 46:35.829
Can I get anybody
a bottled water?

46:35.920 --> 46:38.354
No, no, no. I'm fine.
I'm about to get married.

46:38.520 --> 46:41.193
Oh.
I'm engaged right now, so...

46:41.360 --> 46:43.191
Didn't nobody ask you that.
I'm just letting her know.

46:43.320 --> 46:44.639
Okay, you can't put
a fish in the water

46:44.720 --> 46:46.790
if you don't
want him to swim.

46:46.880 --> 46:47.880
I don't know
where he is,

46:47.920 --> 46:49.558
and if I did
I wouldn't tell you.

46:49.920 --> 46:51.831
You will if you wanna
see him alive again.

46:52.480 --> 46:53.754
Now, AJ is in
way over his head

46:53.840 --> 46:55.040
and we just
trying to help him.

46:55.120 --> 46:56.314
And why
should I believe you?

46:56.400 --> 46:57.628
I didn't come here
to play with you.

46:57.720 --> 46:59.676
You think I'm gonna give up my man?
Oh, you're gonna give him up.

46:59.800 --> 47:02.155
Guaranteed, you're
gonna give him up... Nope, I'm not.

47:02.240 --> 47:03.360
Stop.
It's a little too much.

47:03.440 --> 47:04.555
Tasha...

47:05.560 --> 47:08.028
James may not understand
what you're saying, but I do.

47:08.120 --> 47:09.872
I mean, you and AJ
obviously have a connection,

47:09.960 --> 47:11.951
and you're trying to
honor him right now.

47:12.040 --> 47:13.268
Right, James?

47:13.360 --> 47:16.397
My question to everyone
standing here is,

47:17.080 --> 47:18.798
is he honoring
you, Tasha?

47:18.880 --> 47:20.518
Because when I went
through this phone, here...

47:20.600 --> 47:21.600
I'm not gonna lie to you.

47:21.640 --> 47:22.640
I was kinda thrown off

47:22.720 --> 47:24.517
by what was going on
in the contact list.

47:24.600 --> 47:25.919
Especially Favorites,

47:26.000 --> 47:28.355
because the first name I
came across was Colette.

47:28.440 --> 47:29.475
I said, "Who is Colette?"

47:29.560 --> 47:31.198
More importantly,
"What's her ringtone?"

47:31.280 --> 47:32.633
So I played it.

47:36.040 --> 47:37.996
I don't know about you,
but that throws me off.

47:38.080 --> 47:39.274
'Cause it's hyper-sexual.

47:39.360 --> 47:40.588
What's that
relationship about?

47:40.680 --> 47:42.113
So I said, "Maybe
that's the only one."

47:42.200 --> 47:43.880
But then right underneath it,
I see "Bree."

47:43.960 --> 47:46.428
Bree? Yeah. Who is that?
What's her ringtone?

47:46.520 --> 47:47.794
So I played it.

47:48.080 --> 47:49.832
Ugh.

47:50.520 --> 47:51.520
James, do you hear that?

47:51.600 --> 47:53.033
Let me see.

47:53.120 --> 47:54.951
Yeah, he licking that
up and down, no doubt.

47:55.040 --> 47:56.680
James, that's a little graphic.
It's true.

47:56.720 --> 47:58.358
Well, disregard that.

47:59.080 --> 48:00.877
So, then I started
thinking about you.

48:00.960 --> 48:02.791
You're priority.
At least, I thought you were.

48:03.120 --> 48:05.200
But, then, I see your name
at the bottom of the list.

48:05.440 --> 48:07.396
So, I said, "Maybe he
saved the best for last."

48:07.480 --> 48:08.879
Then I played
your ringtone, Tasha.

48:08.960 --> 48:10.000
This is where it got dark.

48:10.640 --> 48:12.949
Ugh.

48:13.400 --> 48:14.879
Tasha, that's a Apple chime.

48:17.240 --> 48:20.471
That's a factory ringtone.
That costs absolutely nothing.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.150
That's the guy that
you wanna take up for?

48:23.240 --> 48:24.958
Mr. "Generic Ringtone
For My Lady"?

48:25.840 --> 48:27.353
I'm just asking.

48:27.440 --> 48:29.749
That is how you
talk to a woman.

48:29.840 --> 48:31.432
I got AJ's cell phone burner
number just like that.

48:31.520 --> 48:32.880
And, here's the thing...

48:33.480 --> 48:35.516
Okay. When did we
start doing that?

48:35.640 --> 48:36.675
All right, Maya,
what you got?

48:36.760 --> 48:38.760
My guy Alonso's following a lead
on the explosives.

48:38.840 --> 48:40.398
He said it's definitely
not from the States.

48:40.520 --> 48:41.748
We got a number on AJ.

48:41.840 --> 48:43.717
No, Ben got a number on AJ.

48:43.800 --> 48:44.755
His girl say he
stole some money,

48:44.840 --> 48:45.960
but she didn't
know from who.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.035
Great. Let me know
when you find him.

48:47.160 --> 48:48.920
Champagne?
Here you go, baby. I'll take that.

48:49.120 --> 48:50.120
What are you doing?

48:51.000 --> 48:52.840
Why is it so hard for you
to say the word "we"?

48:52.880 --> 48:55.713
What is wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?

48:55.800 --> 48:58.109
Is that her number
saved to your phone already?

48:58.200 --> 48:59.189
With a smiley face
next to it?

48:59.280 --> 49:00.759
Let's go.

49:00.840 --> 49:03.957
The smiley face with the tongue sticking
out is what you're doing now?

49:04.040 --> 49:06.270
You know why Tasha gave us
the number that we needed, James?

49:06.360 --> 49:07.588
I got the human touch.

49:07.680 --> 49:09.477
That's what I'm telling you.
You just got to be open.

49:09.560 --> 49:11.357
Okay. And let me tell
you something, James,

49:11.440 --> 49:13.795
that is much more important
than being focused.

49:13.880 --> 49:15.518
Just stop for a second,
listen to me.

49:15.640 --> 49:17.119
Here's what we're
going to focus on from now on.

49:17.200 --> 49:20.636
I'm going to deal with
all of the human parts. Male or female.

49:20.720 --> 49:22.312
Oh, you wanna deal with
all the male human parts?

49:22.400 --> 49:23.913
That's not what I said.
That's exactly what you said.

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
Don't twist my words.

49:30.120 --> 49:31.599
Hello?
Ben Barber speaking.

49:32.000 --> 49:32.955
How'd you get this number?

49:33.040 --> 49:35.315
It's a little something
called platinum-level detectiveness, AJ.

49:35.400 --> 49:36.400
Give me that phone.

49:36.480 --> 49:38.869
AJ, your girlfriend told us
about the money you stole.

49:38.960 --> 49:40.678
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
I didn't steal any money.

49:40.760 --> 49:41.760
Be open.

49:41.840 --> 49:44.070
You need to turn yourself in, man.
We need to keep you safe.

49:44.160 --> 49:45.639
How do I know you weren't
in on trying to kill me?

49:45.720 --> 49:48.632
If I wanted to smoke you,
you'd be dead already.

49:48.720 --> 49:49.709
What you need
to understand is

49:49.840 --> 49:51.159
you got some
major heat on you.

49:51.240 --> 49:53.435
The kind of heat
that your skinny ass can't take.

49:53.840 --> 49:55.751
I hang up, AJ,
you dead in 24 hours.

49:56.160 --> 49:58.993
Look around, man.
We're the only friends you got.

49:59.080 --> 50:01.878
You know what? I'm sick
of talking to your ass.

50:02.200 --> 50:04.077
Here.
Wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait.

50:04.400 --> 50:05.833
Hello?
Hello? Hello?

50:05.920 --> 50:07.273
Hello?
Hello.

50:07.440 --> 50:09.078
What's going on?
Ben Barber back on the phone.

50:09.160 --> 50:12.948
Okay, I'll text you a time and location.
Just you, or I bolt.

50:14.680 --> 50:17.274
What was that?
It worked, didn't it?

50:17.720 --> 50:20.632
This nerd steals my money,
exposes my operation,

50:20.720 --> 50:22.119
and he's still
walking the streets?

50:22.200 --> 50:23.519
I put my
best guys on him.

50:23.600 --> 50:24.635
Oh, you better.

50:24.720 --> 50:27.001
The livelihood of merchants
across the globe depend on it.

50:27.040 --> 50:29.156
I get it.
I don't think you do.

50:29.240 --> 50:32.277
My pipeline is opening.
We are exposed.

50:33.080 --> 50:34.433
Kill him.

50:34.520 --> 50:35.794
Yes, sir.

50:36.960 --> 50:38.040
And what about the payment?

50:38.120 --> 50:40.429
Did it get through,
or did that get stolen, too?

50:40.520 --> 50:42.431
Receipt confirmed
by the new commissioner.

50:42.560 --> 50:46.155
Oh, look at that. One thing done right.
Things are looking up.

50:46.920 --> 50:48.717
Now, get out of here.
I'm late.

51:01.960 --> 51:03.279
Here it is.

51:05.240 --> 51:06.719
All right, remember what I told you.
Yeah.

51:06.800 --> 51:08.597
One eye on him
and one eye out.

51:15.320 --> 51:16.833
I can't do it. You do it.
Show me how to do it.

51:16.960 --> 51:18.029
Man, you not a lizard.

51:18.160 --> 51:20.230
Just scan.
Well, then you have to say that.

51:20.320 --> 51:21.469
Get out.
Okay.

51:21.560 --> 51:23.835
I'll be listening.
All right.

51:27.760 --> 51:30.228
I'm walking on
the damn beach.

51:30.320 --> 51:32.834
Listen, AJ, I don't have
time to play games with you.

51:32.960 --> 51:35.190
Where are you?
Whoa, whoa. Slow your roll, son.

51:35.320 --> 51:36.833
It's not that easy.
We gotta make sure we're clear.

51:36.920 --> 51:39.354
Watch your tone.
I didn't come out here to be sassed by you.

51:39.440 --> 51:40.475
Okay, walk to the booth.

51:41.280 --> 51:42.280
What booth? Where?

51:42.360 --> 51:43.554
The other way. Turn around.

51:43.640 --> 51:45.240
This booth?
Yeah, that booth right there.

51:45.320 --> 51:46.800
Okay, I'm walking.
Going to the booth.

51:46.920 --> 51:48.069
Now what? I'm here.

51:48.160 --> 51:50.674
Okay, I want you
to pick up a can.

51:50.760 --> 51:52.591
I got it.
Now, put it back down.

51:53.040 --> 51:54.280
AJ, what are we
doing right now?

51:54.360 --> 51:56.112
I'm seeing if
you're being followed.

51:56.200 --> 51:58.236
Then say that.
That makes sense. Say that.

51:58.320 --> 52:00.117
Just walk.
All right, walking.

52:00.200 --> 52:01.428
Stop.

52:01.520 --> 52:02.520
Remove your shirt.

52:02.640 --> 52:04.039
Why am I
removing my shirt?

52:04.120 --> 52:05.519
To make sure
you're not wired.

52:05.640 --> 52:07.278
See that?
There's no wire.

52:07.360 --> 52:08.395
Ooh! You are shredded.

52:08.560 --> 52:10.198
Abs of steel.

52:10.280 --> 52:12.191
- Stop playing games.
- Okay, walk to the trash can.

52:12.280 --> 52:14.191
T o the trash can? Going.

52:14.360 --> 52:15.679
All right.

52:16.520 --> 52:17.555
Now what?

52:17.640 --> 52:18.720
Now reach into
the trash can

52:18.760 --> 52:20.034
and take out
whatever's on top.

52:22.320 --> 52:24.629
- Is he digging in the trash?
- All right, I got it.

52:24.720 --> 52:27.757
Okay, open the contents
and tell me what it is.

52:31.240 --> 52:34.232
It's just some
half-eaten nachos

52:34.320 --> 52:37.118
with sauce and
guacamole and hair all in it.

52:37.200 --> 52:38.713
Good. That's perfect.

52:38.840 --> 52:39.909
Eat it.

52:40.000 --> 52:41.069
I'm sorry, what?

52:41.160 --> 52:42.275
Eat it.

52:42.360 --> 52:44.032
No! I'm not eating this!

52:44.120 --> 52:45.394
Do it or I walk.

52:45.480 --> 52:46.708
You better not eat that.

52:57.760 --> 52:59.910
That's just nasty.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.274
That was sick.

53:01.360 --> 53:02.952
I can't believe you
actually did that.

53:04.360 --> 53:05.634
That shit was gross.

53:05.720 --> 53:07.320
AJ, get your ass
out here right now.

53:07.400 --> 53:09.868
AJ, you got two seconds to get
out here before you go to jail.

53:12.120 --> 53:13.758
We gotta get out of here.
This is not the place for this.

53:14.000 --> 53:15.840
Then why would you ask me
to meet you out here?

53:15.960 --> 53:17.000
I didn't think it through.

53:18.600 --> 53:20.272
AJ! AJ!

53:27.520 --> 53:29.954
Okay, AJ, somebody
is trying to kill all of us.

53:30.040 --> 53:31.440
They blew up my car
looking for you,

53:31.560 --> 53:33.915
so you need to come clean
and tell us who it is.

53:34.000 --> 53:35.558
I already
told you everything.

53:38.040 --> 53:39.040
Oh, we got company.

53:39.640 --> 53:40.640
Whoa! Get down!

53:40.880 --> 53:41.880
Shit!

53:43.320 --> 53:45.311
What are you doing?
I'm about to start shooting!

53:45.400 --> 53:47.000
You ain't never shot
out of a moving car!

53:47.040 --> 53:48.234
You gonna drive
or you gonna shoot, James?

53:48.320 --> 53:49.435
Pick one!
Shit!

53:51.960 --> 53:53.154
Switch!
I'm going over.

53:53.240 --> 53:54.389
Hurry! Wait!

53:54.480 --> 53:55.799
You guys are
gonna do that now?

54:00.040 --> 54:01.598
Stop!
Get your ass off of me!

54:01.840 --> 54:03.637
James, get off...

54:04.920 --> 54:06.148
I got it! I got it!

54:10.360 --> 54:11.429
Oh, my God!

54:12.960 --> 54:14.837
Why you got the damn seat
so far back, James?

54:19.800 --> 54:20.915
Front!
James!

54:21.680 --> 54:22.829
All right, don't head
straight at them!

54:22.920 --> 54:24.433
Not right now, James.
I'm getting in my mode.

54:24.520 --> 54:25.839
What mode?

54:29.000 --> 54:30.120
What the hell are you doing?

54:30.160 --> 54:31.195
Ben!

54:39.600 --> 54:40.600
Fuck!

54:43.040 --> 54:44.040
Get back!

54:50.120 --> 54:52.076
They're coming back!
I got it.

54:59.040 --> 55:00.189
Hold on!

55:12.320 --> 55:13.469
What the hell was that?

55:13.560 --> 55:14.709
What?

55:14.800 --> 55:15.800
Huh?

55:16.240 --> 55:17.240
That's called driving!

55:17.320 --> 55:19.072
Where you learn
how to drive, man?

55:19.160 --> 55:20.920
James, just get off my back
and let me do me.

55:22.680 --> 55:24.557
Bust a U!
Hold on!

55:29.080 --> 55:30.149
Lose them!
I'm driving, James.

55:30.240 --> 55:31.434
Right now, I don't need
that type of pressure.

55:31.520 --> 55:33.317
Let me out of here!
Worried about what I'm doing?

55:33.400 --> 55:34.674
How about you
shoot somebody?

55:35.600 --> 55:36.600
Lean back!

55:37.160 --> 55:39.071
Don't shoot across
my face like that!

55:48.160 --> 55:49.878
Are you signaling?

55:51.080 --> 55:52.798
I'm sorry! It's a habit!

55:57.360 --> 55:59.590
He's making a right.
This is too easy!

56:00.200 --> 56:01.200
Ahhh!

56:07.040 --> 56:08.268
He told you
not to do that!

56:08.360 --> 56:09.998
Listen, I got a plan.

56:10.080 --> 56:11.718
Well, execute
the goddamn plan!

56:15.800 --> 56:16.800
Here we go!

56:19.080 --> 56:20.840
He's making another right.
Everybody hold on!

56:25.240 --> 56:26.468
Shit! He went left!

56:32.120 --> 56:33.235
Yeah!

56:33.320 --> 56:34.594
I'm Ben Barber, bitch!

56:37.160 --> 56:38.240
Game over.

56:50.480 --> 56:51.799
Get your ass out.
Come on, dude!

56:51.880 --> 56:54.030
Ow! Let me go.
You guys are nuts.

56:54.160 --> 56:55.195
Where the hell are we?

56:55.280 --> 56:56.280
Safe house.

56:56.320 --> 56:58.280
We staying here till we
find out who we can trust.

57:00.200 --> 57:01.200
Really, fellas?

57:01.320 --> 57:04.312
- Whose house is this?
- Alonso's. My explosives guy.

57:04.440 --> 57:06.078
He's out on a case.

57:06.200 --> 57:07.235
Who the hell is she?

57:07.600 --> 57:08.669
I'm Miami homicide.

57:09.480 --> 57:11.391
James, if you
give me to the cops,

57:11.480 --> 57:13.277
I will be hanging
from a bedsheet.

57:13.360 --> 57:14.679
You think I give
a damn, AJ?

57:15.000 --> 57:17.434
Now, who did you steal from,
and who's shooting at us?

57:17.520 --> 57:19.192
I ain't telling you shit.
Is that right?

57:19.920 --> 57:21.751
Pope! Antonio Pope!

57:21.840 --> 57:23.432
- A-N-T-O-N-I-O...
- Antonio Pope?

57:23.520 --> 57:25.556
- That's bullshit.
- It's not bullshit, all right?

57:25.640 --> 57:27.676
Everyone thinks Pope
is this legit businessman,

57:27.760 --> 57:29.193
but he's so not.

57:29.280 --> 57:33.831
He is a huge criminal, into everything.
Drugs, guns...

57:33.920 --> 57:35.592
So Troy must be
his Atlanta boy.

57:35.720 --> 57:36.720
Yes!

57:37.440 --> 57:38.668
That's a big operation.

57:38.760 --> 57:40.716
Catching Pope would
get us Troy for sure.

57:40.800 --> 57:43.792
To sum up, I'm his
cyber dark arts guy.

57:43.880 --> 57:46.599
I hack into his competition,
I install his systems.

57:46.720 --> 57:47.914
I launder his money.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.116
You just admitted to about
four or five crimes right there.

57:50.200 --> 57:51.474
No, it's Fifth Amendment.

57:51.560 --> 57:52.788
A couple of days ago,

57:52.880 --> 57:56.270
I may have taken some money
from his account

57:56.360 --> 57:57.713
and put it into mine.

57:57.800 --> 57:58.835
- You "may have"?
- What?

57:58.920 --> 58:00.876
I didn't think he'd notice.
Apparently, he did.

58:00.960 --> 58:01.949
Maya, what the
hell is that...

58:02.080 --> 58:03.308
Stop right there!

58:03.480 --> 58:04.880
Drop your gun, man!
You put it down!

58:05.000 --> 58:06.035
- Drop it!
- Hold on!

58:06.120 --> 58:08.315
AJ, stop screaming!

58:08.400 --> 58:09.400
I'll shoot your face!

58:09.480 --> 58:10.595
This is Alonso,
my explosives guy.

58:10.680 --> 58:12.160
I don't give a damn!
Put it down, now!

58:12.240 --> 58:14.310
- Alonso, holster your weapon. They're cops.
- Don't do it, man.

58:14.400 --> 58:15.799
You better drop it!
Put your gun away.

58:15.880 --> 58:16.920
Put it down, Castro!

58:16.960 --> 58:18.029
Drop it!

58:19.680 --> 58:20.749
It's down, okay?
You put it down.

58:20.840 --> 58:22.717
- Ben, we're good.
- All right.

58:25.400 --> 58:27.277
What the hell?

58:28.040 --> 58:29.837
Again?
You've done this before?

58:29.920 --> 58:31.148
I don't know what to tell you, James!

58:31.240 --> 58:32.434
Okay, I'm on edge.
We're cop killers.

58:32.520 --> 58:33.748
My nerves is bad, man!

58:33.840 --> 58:35.751
I told you to focus!
You think I meant to do it!

58:35.840 --> 58:36.875
I thought he shot.

58:36.960 --> 58:38.279
You didn't shoot, so I shot!

58:38.440 --> 58:41.910
Oh, my God!
He a zombie! Head shot!

58:42.080 --> 58:43.399
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

58:44.480 --> 58:46.118
- Hold up! Hold up!
- Hold up!

58:46.480 --> 58:47.595
It's a vest!

58:48.200 --> 58:49.235
Idiots.

58:50.120 --> 58:51.519
It's a vest.

58:54.800 --> 58:57.030
That's why I need a vest, James.
Accidents like this.

58:57.120 --> 58:59.680
Who are these two fools,
and what are they doing in my house?

58:59.760 --> 59:00.988
They're the officers
from Atlanta.

59:01.080 --> 59:02.957
It was their car that exploded.
Hey, man.

59:03.040 --> 59:04.393
I'm Ben Barber.
I apologize.

59:04.560 --> 59:06.278
Hey, man. CÃ¡llate la boca.
What?

59:06.360 --> 59:09.636
Or I reach into your chest and
snatch out your midget heart.

59:09.720 --> 59:11.199
Okay, I came over
here to apologize.

59:11.280 --> 59:12.713
You shot me.
Well, I take it back.

59:12.800 --> 59:14.392
Take the sorry with you and leave!
Fine!

59:14.480 --> 59:16.789
Can we just stay focused?
Did you find anything out?

59:17.800 --> 59:20.234
The explosive from the car
and the detonator, both rare.

59:20.320 --> 59:21.514
Eastern-European,
actually.

59:21.600 --> 59:22.715
It's freaking Pope!

59:22.800 --> 59:23.835
Can you stop with that!

59:23.920 --> 59:25.717
Hold on, Maya. He could
be telling the truth.

59:25.800 --> 59:27.074
It would take someone
with serious reach

59:27.160 --> 59:28.991
to locate that kind of
untraceable device.

59:30.800 --> 59:32.631
You're gonna help me get
some hard evidence on him.

59:32.720 --> 59:34.517
Pope ain't gonna stop
shooting at your ass,

59:34.600 --> 59:35.953
so we the only
choice you got.

59:36.040 --> 59:38.429
You set up his
computer, right?

59:38.520 --> 59:39.714
So, can you
get us into it?

59:41.120 --> 59:42.960
Someone would need to
get to his home computer,

59:43.000 --> 59:45.070
and download
the shipping manifests.

59:45.160 --> 59:47.196
Well, Pope's having a party
at his mansion tonight.

59:47.280 --> 59:49.032
Security's gonna be tight.

59:49.120 --> 59:50.838
There's gonna be a lot of
foreign dignitaries there.

59:50.920 --> 59:52.069
No problem.

59:52.160 --> 59:53.718
We're gonna get in
there undetected,

59:53.800 --> 59:56.075
he's gonna let us know
where the computer is,

59:56.160 --> 59:57.673
and he gonna
talk us through.

59:57.760 --> 59:59.478
How do we get in undetected?

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:13.680
Name?

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:15.748
My name.

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:17.589
My name.

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:18.840
Prince Admiral
Steven Matumbe.

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:20.748
Nigerian Consul.

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.199
Plus two.

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:25.633
My two servants.

01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:27.233
I don't have you
on the list.

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:29.197
Then check the VIP list.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:31.350
And do not look me
in my eye.

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:32.879
Don't look at me.

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:35.110
You look at the pad,
you read the names.

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:37.077
And you look at me,
and you close your eyes.

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:38.434
Look at me.
Don't look at me.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.069
Look at me!

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:41.752
That was a test.
You failed.

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:44.274
You aren't on it.

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:45.429
All right,
stall him, guys.

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:47.389
AJ's on it.

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:48.600
Step aside, por favor.

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.075
Wait!

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.593
This is all your fault.

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:56.753
You know I do what
I am supposed to do.

01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:58.313
I clothe you,
I feed you,

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:02.796
and yet your incompetence
furiates me.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:03.915
Sir.

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:06.788
I'm your bodyguard,
not your servant.

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:12.155
You are what I say you are!

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:13.600
Oh, God.

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.235
Sorry, sir.

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:18.432
You got a fly on your face.

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:19.520
Ooh.

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:24.635
Traditional.
A sign of respect.

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:28.560
Okay, try it now.
Check the list one more time.

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:32.678
There it is.

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.518
Sorry about that.
Head right in.

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:36.794
I will go.

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:38.035
No, no, no!

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:39.678
Release me!
This way.

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:42.360
Where are we?
I cannot feel my face.

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:44.473
And you're welcome.

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:47.995
Hello.

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:50.719
Remember, we're
on the defense.

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:52.554
AJ is on the earpiece.

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:55.359
All you gotta do is
download the file.

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:56.994
You trust him
to do this?

01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:59.275
Of course not.
Do we have a choice?

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:01.675
First of all,
Ben can hear you.

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:04.080
Oh, James,
look at that!

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:05.957
They got a Baccarat
diamond dolphin.

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:07.917
Yeah, he probably got
a Gucci toilet, too.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.230
Do I look like I care? Stay on point.
Just walk.

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:12.040
If he got a Gucci toilet,
I'm sitting on it.

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.235
There he is.
AJ, can you hear us?

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:23.560
Hey, is this
a passed-app event?

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.517
Because I'd love
a wonton or two.

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:27.033
It's not racist if I say it.

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.189
Where are we going?

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:30.271
First, you have to get
to the north hallway.

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:31.920
It leads to
the other wing of the house.

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.151
I'm gonna create
a distraction.

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:37.232
You guys, act casual
until you see an opening.

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:47.120
What you doing?
Put your hands down.

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:48.355
I'm waving.

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:59.032
Law enforcement is always
welcome at my functions.

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:01.835
So, Mr. Pope,
do you dance?

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:03.069
Do I dance?

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:06.114
You're in for a treat.

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:30.355
Are you dancing?
Yes.

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:31.475
Well, stop.

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:42.638
Okay, it worked.

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:44.634
Let's get busy.

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:47.837
He's really good, though.
I'm not sure... Let's go.

01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:55.313
- Okay, Ben, go up the first set of stairs.
- Roger that.

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:57.311
And, proceed to
the end of the hallway.

01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.348
All right, James,
it's stealth mode time.

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:02.436
Do you even know what
"stealth mode" mean?

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.839
Yes, it's from
Assassin's Creed.

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:05.069
It means to be
undetectable.

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:07.037
The double doors to his
office are on the left.

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:08.120
Okay.

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:10.960
Tell me when you're there.
All right, AJ, this must be it right here.

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:15.320
It's locked, AJ.
Okay, you know what?

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.510
Guest bathroom is down the hallway.
We'll get in from there.

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:19.079
Okay. Let's go, man.

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:22.436
Go, go, go.
I got this.

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.879
Hey, man.

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:27.313
Did you see her?
See who?

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:28.355
I think she went
down there.

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:29.589
She said she was
gonna have my baby.

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:30.954
No, man, you can't be up...

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:32.234
Get downstairs.

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:33.833
Use the bathroom downstairs.
Get down there.

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:36.593
Okay, I need you
to go over to the window and open it.

01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:39.069
Okay, I see it.
I see it. I see it.

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:41.469
Okay.
All right, it's open.

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:42.993
Climb out.
I'm sorry, what?

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:45.389
You heard me.
I said climb out.

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.358
Uh, AJ, I'm two stories up.

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:53.032
Look we're here now.
So own it.

01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:54.269
Ain't nobody say
nothing to me about

01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:55.952
getting out of a window
two stories up.

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:57.632
Ben, get on that damn ledge.

01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:58.869
I'm two stories up, James!

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.313
You heard me!
Get on that ledge.

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:01.509
Now.

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:06.396
They got
a Gucci toilet, James.

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:15.679
Come on, Ben.

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:19.469
Okay.

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:21.315
Okay.

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:29.675
Hey, guys?

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.990
I'm in between two lamps
and a hard place.

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:36.673
I'm just gonna...
I'm just gonna try to reach for it.

01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:38.309
Okay?

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:40.356
No, no! Guys! Lost balance!

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:43.596
Oh! God!

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.348
Stupid...

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:56.150
Excuse me, sir.

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.514
Can I offer you
a lamb burger?

01:05:57.640 --> 01:05:58.914
Stop! James!

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:01.148
Get back! Get back!

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:02.673
Lamb burger?
Yeah.

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:04.751
I ain't never had one of them.
Let me see.

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:07.149
Help! James!

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:08.753
Oh, my God!

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.991
This has got a Spanish kick to it.
What kind of cheese is that?

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:13.718
Manchego cheese.
Manchego?

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:23.229
Leave me alone!

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:27.515
Help!

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:28.669
You didn't
cook these, did you?

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:30.193
Get your ass back!

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:32.880
Ben, what's going on?

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:36.395
Get back!
Gator got my foot!

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:38.708
Get off! Get off my ankle!

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:42.439
Leave me alone!

01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:46.193
I don't wanna
die like this!

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:51.033
I don't care!
You can keep it!

01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:59.751
Hey, Ben, you okay?

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:00.840
Are you, okay? Confirm.

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:02.114
Shut the hell up, AJ!

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:03.599
You couldn't tell me
that he had a alligator?

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:05.557
Well, I dropped the ball on that.
I won't lie to you.

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:06.640
A alligator!

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:07.755
Did Marcus bite you?

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.673
Can I offer you a drink?

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:11.876
Oh... No.

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:15.270
Wait. Maya, I need more time!
A gator got my shoe.

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:19.069
Yes. Yes, I would actually
love to have a drink.

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.718
Fantastic.

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:23.268
Do you like tequila?
Yeah.

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:24.920
All right. What's going on?

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.592
Hold on, James.

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:28.588
Okay.

01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:30.830
Okay, AJ, I'm headed
in the office right now.

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:32.349
Wait, wait!
What? What?

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:33.520
He got a alligator in here?

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:35.909
No. It's gator-free
from here on out.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.353
There's an audio alarm system.

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:38.714
Well, when were you
gonna tell me that?

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:40.199
You don't think that's
need-to-know information, AJ?

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:43.670
No one's perfect! All right,
just get to the desk quietly.

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:46.155
Stop playing.
This is serious. Okay.

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:48.037
Going to the desk now.

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:52.317
Oh! He got a black panther!

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:53.640
Jesus!

01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:55.999
Quietly, Ben!

01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:59.151
The alarm system is
picking up some audio in Pope's office.

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:00.992
Check it out.
Copy.

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:02.752
James? Ben set off
the alarm.

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:03.829
You're gonna have
to run interference.

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:06.310
East hallway.
He's traveling towards you.

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:08.916
Okay. Okay.

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:13.469
Hydrangeas.

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:16.073
He's got hydrangeas.

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:26.517
Okay, AJ.

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:28.278
I'm at the computer.
Guide me through it.

01:08:28.359 --> 01:08:29.759
Okay, there's a
seven-digit code

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:31.671
that he inputted himself,
so I don't know it.

01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:34.319
But I use my own personal code
on there, as well.

01:08:34.399 --> 01:08:35.879
Because, you know, why not?

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:38.279
You really are a criminal, aren't you, AJ?
What's the code?

01:08:38.359 --> 01:08:39.395
Open bracket, O,

01:08:39.479 --> 01:08:40.629
closed bracket, space,

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:42.990
open bracket,
O, closed bracket.

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.392
Wait a minute.
Wait, are they...

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:47.154
Titties, yep.

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:49.988
What now, AJ?

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:52.196
Now, plug in that flash drive
I gave you and open the file on it.

01:08:52.279 --> 01:08:53.429
All right, I got it.

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:54.993
The rest takes care of itself.

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.111
Thank you, my darling.
My pleasure.

01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:59.270
So tell me about this tequila.
Is it rare?

01:08:59.359 --> 01:09:01.635
One of the rarest on the market.
Impossible to purchase.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:02.755
Salud.

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:09.393
Okay, moments away, guys.

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:11.232
Look, you guys
need to hurry up.

01:09:11.319 --> 01:09:13.550
I ain't gonna keep
knocking people out all night.

01:09:15.319 --> 01:09:16.319
Okay, it's done.

01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:18.277
- Did you know...
- Maya, let's roll.

01:09:18.399 --> 01:09:19.674
Oh, I gotta go.

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:20.800
Mmm.

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:22.314
Thank you.
Okay. My hand.

01:09:22.399 --> 01:09:23.832
I gotta go.

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:25.120
High five.

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:26.553
Here you go.

01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:30.069
This has got to
be one of the worst goddamn days.

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:33.868
Alligators, hydrangeas,
swords all over the place.

01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:34.960
Where your shoe?

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.234
It's a long story, James.

01:09:36.319 --> 01:09:37.799
The man got
a damn alligator.

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:38.880
You look silly!

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:43.154
This look better,
James? Huh?

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:44.349
Is that better, now?

01:09:44.439 --> 01:09:45.509
Hey, guys,
did you get it?

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:46.669
Yes. I'm a professional!

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:48.478
Okay, we gotta go.

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:50.640
Officers.

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:54.680
Interesting look.

01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:56.512
Interesting home.
In my country...

01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:58.158
Cut the act.
Yes.

01:09:58.400 --> 01:09:59.594
The party is this way.

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:00.954
I insist.
Okay.

01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:05.798
Have a drink.

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:07.996
RÃ©my? Dom?

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:10.150
I got this shit
from Peru.

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:14.313
Illegal in the States,
but it can keep you up all night.

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:15.549
If you know what I mean.

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:19.200
No.

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:20.993
We're not thirsty.

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:23.394
I'm not thirsty.

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:25.869
Look at that.
Class is still in session.

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:26.995
Hmm?

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:30.595
When are you going to let Ben
make his own mistakes, James?

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.036
Yes, that's right.
I know your names.

01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:34.633
Does that surprise you?

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:35.920
Perhaps the bigger
question is,

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.878
why are the Atlanta police
crashing my party?

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:42.350
Well, we thought that you
might have a problem with theft.

01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:46.199
Now that you
mention it, I did have

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:48.271
an embezzlement
issue this week.

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:50.749
Don't remember
reporting it, though.

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:52.751
I'm guessing that you
found the culprit.

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:53.909
Hmm?

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.638
Oh, you douchebag.

01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:57.199
I think you know
who took from me.

01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:59.635
And if I don't get
some answers soon,

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:01.676
a few of my city official
friends in Atlanta

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:03.079
won't be
too happy to learn

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:05.628
that one of their benefactors
is being harassed.

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:07.073
In his own home,
no less.

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:08.428
What, you gonna
snitch on us?

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:09.669
Do you think we care?

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:12.957
It is true that one of you
might just receive a reprimand.

01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:16.834
But what if one of you
is still on his probationary period?

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:19.633
That particular officer,
he could be eliminated.

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:22.677
- Just like that.
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:24.671
I don't think we need to ruin
anybody's careers here.

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:26.472
Especially with
the unemployment rate

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:27.993
being so high
amongst blacks now.

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:29.149
Tranquilo.

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:30.679
I'm sorry, what?

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:34.070
Listen, all I know is that I'm a
victim of a hacker who stole from me.

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.394
I don't even want
to have him arrested.

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:36.873
I just want to
figure out how he got in,

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.560
so I can prevent it
from happening again.

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:42.635
I'm worried that
my charities are vulnerable.

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.391
So, if you are
not here to help,

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:46.869
why did you come?

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.393
I heard you had
a Gucci toilet.

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:54.512
I think we're done here.

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:56.473
My men will show you out.

01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:58.712
And the next time
you want to come

01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:00.995
to one of my parties,
just ask.

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:02.759
Your parties suck.

01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:08.400
What went wrong?

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:10.319
Now, I'm feeding
these people sliders,

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:13.710
and having conversations
I don't want to be having?

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:15.553
Take it easy. I'm not
going to shoot you.

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:18.279
This is just a prop
to make my point.

01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:20.749
We are multi-national now.

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:22.956
Any mistakes will
be way too costly.

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:24.040
Hmm?

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:26.598
No more
annoying conversations.

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.158
No more excuses.

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:33.398
Just get the job done.

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:38.358
Sorry, Antonio.

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:40.713
Definitely kill them.

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:43.712
I just don't want to
get blood on my pants.

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:49.681
Okay, I found a discussion
he tried to erase on his big solar project.

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:51.354
Looks like Pope
orders his guy

01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:53.715
to delete certain shipments
from the manifest.

01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:55.836
But he specifically
tells that guy

01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:57.120
to leave other
shipments alone.

01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:59.310
Why would he wanna hide
shipments of solar panels?

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:01.072
Because it's not
solar panels.

01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:04.800
He's got one of them hidden
shipments arriving tomorrow.

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:06.518
We need to find out
what's in that shipment.

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:07.669
Wait.

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:09.200
Does that mean
what I think it means?

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:10.873
We are on a stakeout!

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:13.474
Long-time dream achievement,
unlocked.

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:15.840
You know, I think I
really proved myself this trip.

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:18.350
And, I guarantee you, James,
that truck gonna be full of drugs.

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:19.589
All right, man, slow down.

01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:23.639
If the Port Commissioner wasn't
cooperating, it could be a problem.

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:24.994
One to kill for.

01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:27.958
He tried to cooperate,
but Pope still killed him anyway.

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:30.676
How do you know that?
I was there, on Pope's yacht.

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:31.994
When I told you to tell me
everything you know,

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:33.991
why you didn't tell me
everything you knew?

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:35.360
I didn't see anything,
all right?

01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:36.680
I was listening in
on his phone.

01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:38.432
Well, then, shut up
with all that hearsay.

01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:40.158
It's not admissible
in court.

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:45.112
Star Wars,
the original trilogy.

01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:46.520
Name them and
rank them, let's go.

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:47.953
Episode Five,
Empire Strikes Back.

01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:50.600
Episode Four, New Hope.
Episode Six, Jedi. Boom.

01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:51.999
Empire Strikes Back?

01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:53.439
What?

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:54.589
Return of the Jedi,
I don't know.

01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:56.875
Jedi! Oh, my God.
Those Ewoks?

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.991
The Ewoks are what made Star Wars.

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:00.758
They're so annoying.
No, no.

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:02.717
- James? James?
- Maya? Maya?

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:03.869
James, real quick.
Maya.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.433
James? James?
Maya? Maya?

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:07.238
If you could be a shark or a eagle,
which one would you be?

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:08.435
Shark!
You got so many disadvantages

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:10.636
being a shark.
If you're an eagle, you're flying!

01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:13.634
- I saw a eagle take this lady baby one time.
- No!

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:16.548
Biggie Smalls.
Is he slightly overrated?

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:17.829
He's no Sir Mix-a-Lot.

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:18.920
What?

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.718
Maya? Maya?
Maya? Maya?

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:22.028
James? James?
James?

01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:23.553
Shut up!
Shut up!

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:28.719
Damn.

01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:32.352
They got some nerve.

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:37.553
He never stops talking.
He's got to be able to breathe.

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:40.234
Yep. Trust me,
I know.

01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:42.476
Nine out of 10 things
out that dude mouth

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:45.677
is either crazy,
irrational, or silly.

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:47.512
But that 10th thing...

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:52.238
Tenth thing goes
beyond crazy, you know,

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:55.915
into a, like,
accidental genius realm.

01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:59.032
I'm gonna
ask you something.

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:00.473
If you really
feel that way,

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:02.238
why are you so
tough on that guy?

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.754
All he wants is
to be a detective.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:08.749
He's setting himself up for a
disappointment when we get back, so...

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:17.516
Trucks! James!
Oh!

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:20.120
I see the trucks!
The trucks are coming, look!

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.269
Give it to me.

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:28.078
AJ, get ready to check the container
numbers against the Port's manifest.

01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:29.479
Copy that.

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:31.676
All right, where are we going?
Where are we going?

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:33.600
This is the one.
Right here. What's the number?

01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:36.951
4-5-5-2-3-4-5-B.

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:40.158
That number does not exist.
It's a ghost.

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:41.514
Jackpot.

01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:51.840
There you go.

01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:54.388
Copy that. We're heading
west on Port Bridge.

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:56.277
Bring all units
on outbound lanes

01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:58.635
and set up
a blockade at Biscayne.

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:01.038
This is MDPD Air One.

01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:03.390
En route following
westbound 886...

01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:15.198
Okay, here we go.

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:26.794
Hands! Hands up!

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:28.320
Get your hands up!
Get them hands up!

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:30.080
- Put your hands up!
- Ben, get the door!

01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:33.669
Out the cab, Slim!

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:37.199
Hurry up!
Turn around!

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:39.158
You know who this
truck belong to?

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:40.713
Yeah, it belong to me.

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:41.949
Us!

01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:43.553
It's our first bust!

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:45.278
As the brothers-in-law.

01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:47.828
Get to the back.
Right. I'm on it.

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:53.435
Open it up!

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:06.195
All right, Ben, let me know
what we got, partner.

01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:07.952
Is it my birthday?

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:09.440
No!

01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:10.879
Okay, it must be Christmas!

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:12.880
What we got?

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:19.391
Department's about
to get sued for harassment.

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:21.914
And, I get to explain
to the new Port Commissioner,

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.070
why we've made a mess
of his front yard!

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:25.519
We had good intel.

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:27.909
It was an unregistered,
off-the-books shipment.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.479
It was a clerical error.

01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:31.676
I really don't understand

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:33.079
what I gotta do
to get off

01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:35.469
whatever shit list
I seem to be on, here.

01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:37.358
Mr. Pope,
let me apologize.

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:39.239
See, I don't get it.

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:42.080
I've tried to be nice.
I've tried to be cool.

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:45.357
Did I press charges when you
three crashed my party? No.

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:46.880
But, now...

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:49.434
See, now, I'm pissed.

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:52.074
I have a reputation
to protect.

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:54.915
This is gonna
come out weird,

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:56.992
but I'm really,
really rich.

01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:58.752
I mean, I make
sick money.

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:01.308
And, do you know what
that money buys me?

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:02.440
Hmm?

01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:04.509
Access.

01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:08.473
So, you can imagine

01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:11.028
that I have already
begun to make calls

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:12.838
up the chain of command.

01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:17.918
So, James, it looks to me
like your training day is officially over.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.833
But hey, good luck on
your future careers,

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:23.633
or whatever.

01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:30.840
Captain!

01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:32.829
Can I have a word?

01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:36.434
You, come with me.

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:40.036
You can help me explain this mess
to the new commissioner.

01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:41.155
Shit.

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:44.469
Ouch.

01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:46.113
That went really badly.

01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:48.034
It's kind of hard to
think of any outcome

01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:49.920
that's gonna be worse
than that, right there.

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:55.559
It's about to get worse.

01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:57.720
Hello?

01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:00.109
Milk run, huh? I'm gonna assume you've
been chewed out already,

01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:01.553
so I'm gonna save my voice.

01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:03.790
James, we're talking about
a lengthy suspension.

01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:05.438
Ben, you're
still probationary,

01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:06.509
so there's really no choice.

01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:08.716
Wait, Lieutenant Brooks.
Hold on, now.

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:10.199
There'll be a hearing,
but it's just a formality.

01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:11.759
You're done as a cop, Ben.

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:12.840
Like "done," done?

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:15.514
Lieutenant, you don't wanna hear
my side of the story?

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:16.920
No! Just get your
asses back here!

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.035
Please, don't do this.

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:20.429
You did this!
You and James!

01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:22.158
Lieutenant!

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:24.840
Here, man.

01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:39.996
What the hell
did we miss?

01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:43.952
I know that shipment ain't
nothing but a front to move coke.

01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:46.873
Yeah, but the containers
was empty, James.

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:49.555
Maybe the container
was made of coke.

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:52.188
I'll put a pin in that.

01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:53.599
I gotta use
the bathroom so bad.

01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:57.869
This is Ang.

01:19:58.720 --> 01:19:59.869
Hey, what's up, babe?

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:02.036
- Ben, I need you here now.
- Angela?

01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:03.712
Cori is driving me crazy.

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:05.313
You said two days.
I know.

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:09.029
Hey, I'm marrying someone on Saturday.
I'd prefer it to be you.

01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:10.951
Look, the whole thing
just went pear-shaped.

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.758
We took a swing and
we missed bad, Ang.

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:14.034
We missed real bad.

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:16.470
I am so sorry.

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:18.560
But, no matter
how bad it went,

01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:19.993
I still have faith in you.

01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:22.514
I appreciate that,
babe, but you got...

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:23.715
And, I always will.

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:25.672
We can get through anything.

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:27.079
Together.

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:30.232
I just want you to
know that I love you.

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:32.558
I love you so much.

01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:33.908
Love you.

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:40.319
I was about to tell her
I lost my job,

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:41.549
but then I started
thinking like,

01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:43.153
"No, just wait till
you get home, because..."

01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:44.240
Hey, guys.

01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:46.430
I was just thinking about
the Port Commissioner's replacement.

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:48.750
It's weird how he showed up
on the bridge right after Pope.

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:49.840
So?

01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:51.353
You don't kill
the Port Commissioner

01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:53.078
if you don't control
the replacement.

01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:56.516
- Makes sense.
- That makes a lot of sense.

01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:57.600
Jukebox is ready.

01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:00.200
Got that Taylor Swift song
you wanted, player.

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:02.476
Look, if NuÃ±ez is in on it,

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:05.199
that means Pope is moving
contraband through the port.

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:07.157
NuÃ±ez? Charlie NuÃ±ez?

01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:11.508
That was one of the names on Pope's
payroll report on his computer.

01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:15.200
Was that important?

01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:17.197
Asshole played us.

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:18.952
He planted the info
on his computer,

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:21.640
let us find that container,
got us to prove his innocence,

01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:23.438
so that the other containers
could skate through.

01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:25.715
Son of a bitch.
When is the next shipment, AJ?

01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:27.358
One every morning this week.

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:29.440
We gotta hit him in the morning, then.
Let's do it!

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:32.079
- Let's do it!
- Let's go.

01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:33.957
I should have put that together.
Can I talk to you?

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:35.314
Okay. James?

01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:37.392
Look, I knew
about the containers,

01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:39.118
but my thing is,
I didn't think further than that.

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:40.315
And, that's where
I went wrong.

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:41.713
Look, Ben, I just want to...
Stop, stop.

01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:43.791
You don't have to say it.
I already know what you're gonna say.

01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:45.480
Listen, man, I just
brought you over here

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:47.391
to tell you,
you're not going.

01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:49.199
What are you talking about?

01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:50.998
I am going.
No, you're not.

01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:52.752
Yes, I am, James.
No, you're not.

01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:54.068
You just got
kicked off the force.

01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:55.513
You know what, James?

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:58.034
I've been out here
putting my life on the line,

01:21:58.120 --> 01:21:59.951
to prove to you that
I can be a detective.

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:02.793
I don't know what your real problem is,
James, but this is what I wanna...

01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:03.915
Listen!

01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:07.069
You getting married to
my sister, all right?

01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:10.118
This thing goes wrong,
you can end up in jail.

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:11.954
Or worse.

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:13.509
You can end up dead.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000
What... Oh.

01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:21.240
I'm sorry, Ben,
but this is for your own good.

01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:23.276
Okay, look, they're not gonna let us
within a mile of the port.

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:24.475
We gotta take
a boat and head north.

01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:26.278
You got a boat?
James! Hey, stop!

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:27.680
James!

01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:29.278
I'll tell you
how it goes.

01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:31.794
AJ, AJ, AJ, AJ!

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:33.240
AJ!

01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:43.518
Look, our best bet is to take
a boat across the bay at dawn.

01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:45.040
So your captain
just let you take out

01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:46.792
cars and boats
whenever you want to?

01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:49.155
I don't know.
I don't ask him.

01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:55.749
Come on.

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:00.392
Hey, don't shoot me, man!

01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:02.311
Ain't nobody gonna shoot you.
Show me your hands!

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:03.913
Man, stop it! Come on, get up.
I need your help.

01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:05.109
For what?

01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:37.912
All right, AJ. When we get up here,
I need you to hide.

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:51.714
Okay.

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:53.600
What do you wanna do?

01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:55.680
Slice his hamstrings,
take him down?

01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:56.915
Wow.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.433
That's a bit aggressive.

01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:00.829
I think there's a different way
we could do this.

01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:16.790
Hey, man, do you know
where South Beach is?

01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:18.279
'Cause my GPS ain't
working worth a...

01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:20.669
That is pretty impressive.

01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:22.751
Wanna give it a try?
Can I get him under here?

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:23.840
Yeah, now twist.

01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:26.269
Right?
Oh! Yeah.

01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:27.554
You know,
I gotta do this on Ben.

01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:29.440
Let me show you how we do it in
the A, though.

01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:32.595
Yeah. Well,
that works, too.

01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:45.120
We got him.

01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:46.752
Send a car over to
pick up Pope's ass.

01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:47.840
I'm already here.

01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:49.200
Freeze!

01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:51.276
As a matter of fact,
I'm everywhere.

01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:58.114
Psst! God! You scared
the shit out of me.

01:24:58.280 --> 01:24:59.952
Hey, how'd you get out of...
Don't worry about it.

01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:01.268
Where's James and Maya at?

01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:02.759
Checking a container
somewhere over there.

01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:04.273
The container yard.

01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:06.157
This is classic boss level.

01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:08.276
Something always goes down
in the container yard.

01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:09.908
And it's not just cocaine.

01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:12.474
I'm opening a contraband
super highway.

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:15.870
Guns, drugs, freaking
whale meat. Whatever.

01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:19.390
I think there's even a pygmy
giraffe in one of these.

01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:20.480
Fun.

01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:23.190
I had to come down
to see it for myself.

01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:25.032
And, look what I find.

01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:28.600
Shit, Pope's got them.

01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:33.440
You stay here.
I got an idea.

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:40.357
You look discouraged.

01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:42.312
I feel bad
for you guys.

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:45.551
It's like when my nephew
loses a soccer game. I wanna...

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:48.234
I wanna give you
a hug and a Capri Sun.

01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:49.794
But I feel worse
for these guys.

01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:51.916
I mean, they have to kill
two rogue cops

01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:53.712
who they mistook
for terrorists.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.594
Uncool. They have
to live with that.

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:02.759
I have a better idea.

01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:06.553
How about having a professional
take care of it, hmm?

01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:11.515
Ben Barber, bitches!

01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:19.072
Hold up, James!
Now, I got it!

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:21.395
Yeah!

01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:30.435
Did I do that?

01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:35.360
Oh, shit!

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:41.280
Oh, shit!

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.160
Help!

01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:46.239
Backup! I need backup!

01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:48.432
Help! Help!

01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:50.078
Hey! Hurt Locker!

01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:51.440
Oh, God!

01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:18.434
Maya, down!

01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:24.838
You're welcome.
Let's go.

01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:29.311
You have been
a real nuisance.

01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:33.148
I swear,
I'm a double-secret-spy.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.878
I volunteered to infiltrate
myself in the crew.

01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:46.680
Shit.

01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:55.431
Ah! I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
I won't do it again!

01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:09.355
Look!

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:18.995
Here we go!

01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:29.959
Oh, shit!

01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:32.389
Come on, Ben!

01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:51.435
Oh, I got you now.

01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:55.754
Take this, Pope!

01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:14.875
All right, Pope!

01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:16.435
It's over!

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:17.754
Let me see them hands!

01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:19.393
Out the cab, now!

01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:21.113
Get out, Pope! I will...

01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:25.437
- It's clear!
- Oye, chicos.

01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:26.873
Are you looking
for something?

01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:29.109
Put the gun down, please.

01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:32.033
Put down your weapons, now!

01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:38.558
Now, this is the part
where I needlessly

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:41.313
tell you that you are going to die.
Blah, blah, blah.

01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:44.229
But, of course,
you already know that.

01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:47.480
So, which one of you
would like to go first, hmm?

01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:51.113
James, let's start with you.

01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:03.875
Ben!

01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:05.314
Why'd you
do that, man?

01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:08.479
You're always trying some
Assassin's Creed, Call of Duty stuff.

01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:12.480
Got on a vest.

01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:14.632
You got on a vest?

01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:17.160
See that?

01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:18.919
We protect each other, James.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.069
I don't know about that.

01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:21.798
Technically, you got a vest on.
I know.

01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:23.836
I definitely
saved your life, man.

01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:25.638
Don't go too far, now.

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:27.278
He could've shot me
in the damn head, James.

01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:28.400
He didn't!

01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:30.675
Maya, did I save his life?
Maybe a little.

01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:31.795
Thank you.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.035
James!

01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:56.354
It's clear!

01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:58.635
You know what?

01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:00.240
You might have
saved my life that time.

01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:01.548
I'm telling Angela.

01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:03.039
Come on, walk it off.

01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:04.189
I can't walk.

01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:05.280
Rub some dirt on it.

01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:07.351
I'm not puttin' no dirt
on no bullet holes!

01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:09.914
Hey, man, we the brothers-in-law!
Not anymore.

01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:14.109
Offer is
off the table.

01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:17.950
No brother-in-law of mine
would do that to me.

01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:20.557
You tried to kill me.

01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:24.552
You took down a drug-dealer
and a crooked politician in three days.

01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:26.312
I'm impressed.
I know.

01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:27.800
That's how we do
it in Atlanta, Cap.

01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:28.995
It's a pleasure.

01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:30.274
Thanks, Captain.

01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:31.475
Thanks for
everything, Cap.

01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:32.560
Good luck, guys.

01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:35.392
Okay, look, we got eight hours
to make it back.

01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:37.471
James, the only way we're going
to make it back is by plane.

01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:38.675
Do I look like a bird?

01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:39.715
James, stop, man,
I'm serious.

01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:41.153
That's the only way
we're going to make it back.

01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:42.240
I don't fly.

01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:43.469
This is my wedding, James.

01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:44.600
Hey!

01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:48.160
After all that, you guys were gonna leave
without saying anything?

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.434
Nah, we was actually trying to figure
out how we was gonna get back.

01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:52.714
Figured that.

01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:54.153
So I got you something.

01:31:56.120 --> 01:31:57.599
It's one of
Pope's cars.

01:31:58.280 --> 01:31:59.679
Oh, my God!

01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:00.835
Oh! Let me have it.

01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:02.114
James!
It's nice.

01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:04.635
- Bring it back with no bullet holes.
- Oh, man!

01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:08.395
James! You gotta make her
your "plus one," James!

01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:10.909
Ask her how to open it.
I don't see the handle.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.195
You've got to
let me drive this!

01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:15.153
So, um...
Sure.

01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:16.600
Huh?

01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:20.197
You were inviting me
to the wedding, right?

01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:22.554
I guess so.

01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:24.636
I answered too quick, didn't I?
When I said, "Sure"?

01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:25.755
It's okay.

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:28.991
I was waiting for you to...
But I thought that you...

01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:30.798
Um... Sorry.

01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:34.639
See you later.

01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:36.514
James.
What?

01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:38.079
How do I... Hey,
I gotta drive this.

01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:39.479
You don't need to open it.
Give me the key.

01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:40.840
No, I'mma drive.
Give me the key.

01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:42.399
No, James, I'mma drive.
Don't play with me.

01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:43.959
I'mma drive this time.
Ben, give me that damn key.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.956
James, I'm not gonna do this.
Gimme that.

01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:47.149
Are you serious
right now?

01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:48.639
Give me the damn key!
No.

01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:50.631
Get off!
Get off! Maya, call the cops!

01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:53.598
No, James, you better wait.
Wait till I get in.

01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:56.990
Maya, this is great!
Hey, I'll see you at the wedding!

01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:02.154
Here I come, Angela!

01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:03.919
Yeah!

01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:13.309
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you, Mr. and Mrs. Black Hammer.

01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:15.517
Black Hammer!

01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:19.996
James, come here.

01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:22.196
I'm your brother, in law.

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:28.828
I did it!

01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:31.552
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:35.477
Hey, uh, Cori, I just
wanted to say thank you.

01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:36.760
You did a really
amazing job...

01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:37.995
I did a what?

01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:39.229
You did an amazing job.

01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:40.514
Yeah, you don't
have to tell me that.

01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:42.192
And the fact that you
think I couldn't do it,

01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:43.838
makes me want to
hit you in your sack.

01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:44.955
What?
Do you know what?

01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:46.871
It's your day. Enjoy it.

01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:48.394
Now where can you...

01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:51.040
We're low on run,
we should go on a rum.

01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:52.832
AJ, what are you doing?
I didn't even invite you, man.

01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:54.798
Okay,
I'll get it myself.

01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:57.633
Happy Kwanzaa, Ben.
Sorry for your loss.

01:33:57.800 --> 01:33:59.392
Assface, let me
borrow your keys!

01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:01.675
It's a wedding, AJ.
Ain't nobody die.

01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:05.273
Thank you, babe.

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:07.559
Stop, guys.

01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:10.510
Look, I should have
told you earlier, but I didn't.

01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:12.716
I'm glad you decided
to finally join us.

01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:14.233
You look really nice today.

01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:16.389
Like, handsome.

01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:18.033
Ben.
No, it's okay.

01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:20.151
It's a compliment, just take it.
Not really a compliment.

01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:21.309
All right. You
need to accept it,

01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:22.992
because you're not
gonna get many from him.

01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:25.674
James, about to get on the boat
and drive off with my wife.

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:26.760
Yep.

01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:29.229
You wanna say anything nice to me,
this would be the time.

01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:30.320
Oh.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.035
Bye.

01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:34.831
You wanna say something?
Goodbye.

01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:36.911
James wants to make a toast!
Go ahead!

01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:40.999
Toast! Toast! Toast!
Toast! You said it.

01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:42.589
Come on, big guy.

01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:44.238
Toast.
Toast.

01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:46.960
To Ben.

01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:49.833
You've set me on fire,
stabbed me...

01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:51.512
You stabbed him?
Was a accident.

01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:53.113
Got two of my cars
blown up.

01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:56.193
And, uh, almost
got me killed

01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:57.952
more times than
I can count.

01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:00.509
Now, usually,
I'd toss him off the dock,

01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:02.790
but in this case,

01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:04.435
I can't do that.

01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:07.272
Because, dude,
you saved my life,

01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:12.074
made my sister happier
than I've ever seen her.

01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:14.553
Don't you do this to me,
James. Not here.

01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:19.714
And, in a crazy kinda way,
made me a better person and a better cop.

01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:21.597
Fight it, Ben.

01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:22.789
To my brother-in-law.

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:24.669
Family.

01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:27.878
You finally said
"family," James.

01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:29.279
To Ben and Angela.

01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:30.469
Ben and Angela!

01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:34.556
You are something
else, buddy.

01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:35.709
Come on, Ang.

01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:37.115
You ready?

01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:38.309
Yes!

01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:44.957
Whoo! You hear that?
I hear it.

01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:48.519
It's like a le tigre.

01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:49.960
You know,
that's French for "puma."

01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:51.474
It's not, actually.

01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:53.118
Just go with the
moment, all right?

01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:55.200
People back there want a show.
Let's give them one.

01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:57.752
Baby, you know what I want?
What?

01:35:57.840 --> 01:35:58.920
The Black Hammer.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.880
Then we need to get this
boat out of here, then.

01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:03.756
- Bye!
- Bye!

01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:05.796
Whoo! Bye!

01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:07.234
Ben, I like this.

01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:09.914
Before we go, let's loop back
around one more time!

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.433
I'mma show them what
we capable of, baby!

01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:12.635
You could slow down
a little bit.

01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:13.994
You ain't got nothing
to worry about!

01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:15.160
You with the Black Hammer!

01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:16.155
I'm just gonna get
a little more speed!

01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:17.912
There's a boat
right in front of us.

01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:19.029
I know how to
drive this boat!

01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:20.600
That's the first thing
they teach you.

01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:26.919
Ben, hold on!
Hold on!

01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:29.789
Angela! Stop the boat!

01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:32.030
That's classic Ben.

01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:33.160
Oh.
Oh.

01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:35.310
Ben, how do I
stop this thing?

01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:38.310
Angela!
What?

01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:40.072
This marriage will
never last.

01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:41.275
Let's just pray for him.

01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:43.271
Can he swim?
I hope not.

01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:45.197
Ang, stop the boat!

01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:46.755
James!

01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:48.836
Welcome to the family,
brother-in-law!

01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:51.554
Angela!
Are you trying to kill me?

01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:56.396
Angela, dodge the buoys!

01:36:56.760 --> 01:36:58.034
Ow!

01:37:10.222 --> 01:37:35.666
