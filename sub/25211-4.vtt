00:53.586 --> 00:55.456
Fuck.

03:21.267 --> 03:22.867
Morning.

03:22.901 --> 03:24.371
Can I help you?

03:24.403 --> 03:25.843
Yes, we need to speak with

03:25.871 --> 03:27.471
the parents of Amos Miller,

03:27.506 --> 03:29.546
Esther and Jeremiah.

03:33.912 --> 03:36.252
Tight security.

03:36.282 --> 03:39.782
Well, when you make the best damn
pickle relish in North America,

03:39.818 --> 03:40.858
you take precautions.

03:44.356 --> 03:46.726
Follow the road
past the stables.

03:46.759 --> 03:49.399
The Millers will meet you at
the second grain corridor.

03:49.428 --> 03:51.398
Thank you.

04:33.472 --> 04:36.042
What did he overdose on?

04:36.075 --> 04:40.945
It was a prescription
painkiller called fentanyl.

04:40.979 --> 04:46.019
It's highly lethal,
even in small doses.

04:50.756 --> 04:53.596
Where's his body now?

04:53.625 --> 04:55.825
It's at the Reston morgue.

04:59.898 --> 05:02.668
Why didn't you bring him
back here?

05:02.701 --> 05:04.701
It's... i...

05:04.737 --> 05:08.037
It's not that simple,
I'm afraid.

05:08.073 --> 05:12.543
Your son's body
was found on American soil

05:12.578 --> 05:15.618
as part of an ongoing
police investigation.

05:15.647 --> 05:19.857
Did you find my son?

05:19.885 --> 05:23.055
I was the first officer
on the scene, yes.

05:23.088 --> 05:27.798
Did you try to save him?

05:27.826 --> 05:30.866
I'm sorry.
There was nothing I-I could do.

05:30.896 --> 05:32.766
I need to bury him.

05:32.798 --> 05:36.538
Three days after his death.

05:36.568 --> 05:38.538
Do you understand?

05:45.110 --> 05:46.550
I do.

05:50.949 --> 05:53.389
I'm sorry. Will you just
excuse me a moment?

06:32.491 --> 06:35.831
What?

06:35.861 --> 06:37.631
They found Amos Miller's car

06:37.663 --> 06:40.833
a couple blocks from
the convenience store.

06:40.866 --> 06:42.636
Do you have access
to border logs?

06:42.668 --> 06:43.768
Sure do.

06:43.802 --> 06:47.442
What are you looking for?

06:47.473 --> 06:50.773
I want to find out
when Amos Miller crossed,

06:50.809 --> 06:53.879
and if he was alone.

07:12.631 --> 07:14.171
My God. Thank God you're awake.

07:15.868 --> 07:16.911
Why are you dressed like that?

07:16.935 --> 07:17.905
Do you know what time it is?

07:17.936 --> 07:19.736
I'm not going to school.

07:19.771 --> 07:23.211
It's family fun day.

07:23.242 --> 07:25.782
Okay, um...

07:25.811 --> 07:28.011
Well, listen,

07:28.046 --> 07:30.216
I went to bed last night
and I woke up

07:30.249 --> 07:32.889
somewhere else.

07:32.918 --> 07:34.658
Jenna.

07:34.686 --> 07:35.756
Do you know what I mean?

07:35.787 --> 07:38.157
Like, I... I teleported

07:38.190 --> 07:39.230
in my fucking sleep,

07:39.258 --> 07:41.528
like I went somewhere

07:41.560 --> 07:42.760
from my bedroom.

07:42.794 --> 07:45.664
Like, I woke up,
and it was dark,

07:45.697 --> 07:47.008
and I'm pretty sure
I heard footsteps,

07:47.032 --> 07:48.202
or maybe, like, a generator.

07:48.233 --> 07:49.803
I'm not 100% sure.

07:49.835 --> 07:51.575
I thought that we had this
figured out.

07:51.603 --> 07:52.643
You know what I mean?

07:52.671 --> 07:54.011
And now it's changing.

07:54.039 --> 07:55.879
Like, this thing is changing,
and I...

07:55.908 --> 07:57.708
I don't know if I can
go back to sleep.

07:57.743 --> 07:59.213
Henry...

07:59.244 --> 08:00.614
I'm sorry, I really am,

08:00.646 --> 08:03.116
but I just...

08:03.148 --> 08:05.188
I need to get in there.

08:05.217 --> 08:07.687
What's wrong with you?
What are you doing?

08:07.719 --> 08:09.119
What's going on?

08:09.154 --> 08:10.994
I'm baking.

08:11.023 --> 08:12.563
Okay, I can see that,

08:12.591 --> 08:13.891
but can you stop

08:13.926 --> 08:16.126
and help me figure this out,
please?

08:16.161 --> 08:19.001
I can't help you, all right?
Not today.

08:19.031 --> 08:20.631
But if you want to grab a whisk,

08:20.666 --> 08:22.566
you could help me bake.
It's therapeutic.

08:22.601 --> 08:24.671
Promise.

08:24.703 --> 08:27.603
I'm not going to help you
make fucking cookies.

08:27.639 --> 08:30.009
Well, then, I think
you should leave.

08:33.879 --> 08:36.719
Fine.

08:36.748 --> 08:39.118
Fucking Christ.

08:41.219 --> 08:42.958
Have a great day.
See you next time.

08:42.988 --> 08:45.628
There you go.
Just take your time.

08:52.197 --> 08:54.197
Assholes.

08:54.232 --> 08:55.802
It's not worth the fight.

08:55.834 --> 08:57.434
Gotta save my energy
for the dinner rush.

08:58.904 --> 09:00.704
You ever get a break
from this place?

09:00.739 --> 09:03.009
These are the good shifts.

09:03.041 --> 09:04.881
I get it. I was a barback

09:04.910 --> 09:06.680
at The Lodge in high school.

09:06.712 --> 09:08.282
Hardest two weeks of my life.

09:08.313 --> 09:12.253
- Two weeks?
- Yeah.

09:12.284 --> 09:16.124
Listen, I, wanted to
say thank you for yesterday.

09:16.154 --> 09:17.794
Yeah, well,

09:17.823 --> 09:18.967
we never think
these kind of things

09:18.991 --> 09:21.261
are gonna happen to our kids.

09:23.362 --> 09:25.762
Speaking of which,
how's yours doing?

09:25.797 --> 09:27.367
Henry? She's all right.

09:27.399 --> 09:29.969
Yeah?
She seems like a smart girl.

09:30.002 --> 09:31.272
Must take after her mom.

09:32.904 --> 09:35.904
Maybe.

09:35.941 --> 09:37.641
Anyway, I should get going.

09:37.676 --> 09:39.616
You didn't happen to grab the

09:39.645 --> 09:41.115
pie. You did.

09:41.146 --> 09:42.846
- Got you.
- Thank you.

09:45.283 --> 09:46.828
All right, Bill.
Let me get you your change.

09:46.852 --> 09:48.352
Keep it. It's a tip.

09:50.088 --> 09:51.328
Don't be ridiculous.

09:51.356 --> 09:52.356
I'll take 3 bucks.

09:52.391 --> 09:53.631
It's 20%.

09:58.430 --> 10:02.000
Listen, we should discuss other
opportunities for you here in Reston.

10:02.034 --> 10:05.304
When you finish your shift, why
don't you stop by the auto center?

10:05.337 --> 10:07.937
Cleo, order's up.

10:10.308 --> 10:11.278
Um, okay, yeah.

10:11.309 --> 10:13.379
Thank you, I will.

10:13.412 --> 10:15.152
Great. Good.

10:15.180 --> 10:16.250
See you then.

10:16.281 --> 10:17.881
Okay.

10:20.285 --> 10:22.125
Now, let's take a closer look

10:22.154 --> 10:24.094
at the main characters.

10:24.122 --> 10:26.992
The torture of having
to wait alone

10:27.025 --> 10:28.995
is too much for Vladimir.

10:29.027 --> 10:31.327
He needs to
wake Estragon from his dream.

10:31.363 --> 10:33.803
Now, if we consider
this relationship,

10:33.832 --> 10:37.102
we realize how selfish
Vladimir is,

10:37.135 --> 10:39.235
unable to be alone.

10:44.376 --> 10:46.416
Essays are due on Thursday,
everybody.

10:46.445 --> 10:47.715
No exceptions.

10:52.484 --> 10:54.054
Townes.

10:54.086 --> 10:55.116
I need to talk to you,

10:55.153 --> 10:57.693
but not here, so...

11:01.760 --> 11:03.060
Are you coming?

11:03.095 --> 11:04.995
You look terrible.

11:05.030 --> 11:06.770
Thanks.

11:06.798 --> 11:08.398
You smell bad, too.

11:08.433 --> 11:10.433
You've got a real way
with words, Townes.

11:10.469 --> 11:12.169
Your hygiene has always
been questionable,

11:12.204 --> 11:13.481
but the odor
you're giving off today

11:13.505 --> 11:15.445
is particularly concerning.

11:15.474 --> 11:17.414
Yeah, well, I haven't slept,

11:17.442 --> 11:19.912
like, at all, so...

11:19.945 --> 11:21.745
Townes!

11:21.780 --> 11:23.020
Please, where are you going?

11:23.048 --> 11:25.248
I have to go to class.

11:25.283 --> 11:28.383
Seriously, I maybe got,
like, two hours.

11:28.420 --> 11:31.690
Me too. Check out what I found.

11:33.792 --> 11:35.992
What?

11:36.027 --> 11:36.997
Holy shit.

11:37.028 --> 11:38.968
Can I?

11:38.997 --> 11:40.337
My God.

11:40.365 --> 11:42.165
Somebody grab him!

11:46.505 --> 11:50.005
Yeah, but there's, like,
a hundred of these videos.

11:50.041 --> 11:51.841
Are you sure that it's not fake?

11:51.877 --> 11:53.417
This one's different, I think.

11:53.445 --> 11:54.745
I need to do more research

11:54.780 --> 11:55.750
about who these men are,

11:55.781 --> 11:56.951
but Henry,

11:56.982 --> 11:58.282
you may not be alone.

12:03.955 --> 12:08.325
I teleported in my sleep
last night.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.830
What do you mean?

12:10.862 --> 12:14.362
Like, my subconscious

12:14.399 --> 12:16.399
took my body somewhere.
I don't know.

12:16.434 --> 12:17.874
Whoa.

12:17.903 --> 12:20.473
Or someone summoned you to them.

12:20.505 --> 12:22.305
What?

12:22.340 --> 12:24.310
That's fucking terrifying,
Townes.

12:24.342 --> 12:26.212
You sure it wasn't a dream?

12:26.244 --> 12:28.784
Well, I woke up
in a confined space,

12:28.814 --> 12:31.054
I couldn't see shit,
and I cut myself on something,

12:31.082 --> 12:32.922
so yeah, it didn't feel like
a dream.

12:32.951 --> 12:35.151
Okay, well, maybe we can search
for reported explosions

12:35.187 --> 12:37.064
- to narrow down your location.
- No, I didn't...

12:37.088 --> 12:39.288
It wasn't...
It wasn't, like, destructive.

12:39.324 --> 12:42.294
It was different. It was like...

12:42.327 --> 12:43.427
It was easier.

12:43.461 --> 12:45.261
It was just, like, my body

12:45.297 --> 12:47.897
drifted away.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.203
Right.

12:49.234 --> 12:51.374
Well, you were in
a relaxed state.

12:51.403 --> 12:54.003
Your body wasn't under duress.

12:54.039 --> 12:56.539
Yeah, well, now it fucking is.

12:56.575 --> 12:58.515
I don't know how much longer
I can stay awake.

12:58.543 --> 13:00.143
I'm fucking tired.

13:00.178 --> 13:02.478
And what happens
if I go to sleep, Townes?

13:02.514 --> 13:04.814
I could literally
end up anywhere.

13:09.588 --> 13:12.888
Can...

13:12.924 --> 13:15.994
Can you come

13:16.027 --> 13:17.827
over to my house?

13:19.264 --> 13:21.534
Like, just in case.

13:21.566 --> 13:23.236
You want me to watch you sleep?

13:25.503 --> 13:28.143
I guess, yeah.

13:28.173 --> 13:30.043
I mean, I need
your help, so if you could...

13:30.075 --> 13:32.475
Like... so, like, as a...
As a friend?

13:35.480 --> 13:37.250
Yeah.

13:37.282 --> 13:38.282
As a friend.

13:40.619 --> 13:41.889
A friend who knows

13:41.920 --> 13:46.120
about science and stuff.

13:49.361 --> 13:53.331
I can't do this alone, so...

13:56.935 --> 13:58.975
Meet me here

13:59.004 --> 14:02.504
after sixth period.

14:02.540 --> 14:04.910
- Okay?
- Okay.

14:04.943 --> 14:06.513
Okay.

14:15.253 --> 14:17.053
I'm getting out of here.

14:17.088 --> 14:19.058
If you were smart,
you'd do the same.

14:19.090 --> 14:21.130
He killed her.

14:24.229 --> 14:26.399
He took Tristan
and he killed her.

14:26.431 --> 14:28.171
Dom, you just got to run.

14:28.199 --> 14:29.439
All right? You pack a bag

14:29.467 --> 14:31.907
you disappear.

14:31.937 --> 14:33.637
He told me where to find him.

14:33.672 --> 14:35.442
- I can get him back.
- No, no.

14:35.473 --> 14:36.613
Dom, you can't, okay?

14:36.641 --> 14:38.911
It's a trap. You know that.

14:38.944 --> 14:41.084
That's why I need your help.

14:44.482 --> 14:45.452
No.

14:45.483 --> 14:47.353
They cut me open.

14:47.385 --> 14:48.625
You saw it.

14:48.653 --> 14:51.023
They'll do the same thing
to Tristan.

14:51.056 --> 14:52.526
They have no reason to hurt him.

14:52.557 --> 14:54.497
There's no proof
that teleportation is genetic.

14:54.526 --> 14:58.966
Tristan could be the proof.

14:58.997 --> 15:00.997
That's how they think.

15:06.338 --> 15:08.008
What is this place?

15:08.039 --> 15:09.339
Do you know?

15:09.374 --> 15:10.714
Yeah, yeah. It's another

15:10.742 --> 15:14.542
gravitational wave observatory.

15:14.579 --> 15:16.679
Like the one I was in.

15:16.715 --> 15:18.355
It's not dissimilar.

15:18.383 --> 15:21.053
You'd be a fucking idiot
to go in there.

15:21.086 --> 15:22.556
Help me.

15:26.624 --> 15:28.124
Please.

15:33.031 --> 15:34.501
Fuck.

15:34.532 --> 15:36.572
Take care of yourself.

15:44.542 --> 15:47.282
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

16:21.279 --> 16:22.649
How much longer?

16:22.680 --> 16:24.550
Are you in a rush?

16:24.582 --> 16:28.392
Randy, The Lodge doesn't open
for a little while.

16:29.354 --> 16:33.224
But they open early
on pub quiz night.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.740
Found what you're looking for?

16:47.372 --> 16:49.412
Yeah, she's all yours.

17:07.659 --> 17:08.759
Officer Walker?

17:08.792 --> 17:10.393
I got some bad news.

17:10.428 --> 17:12.167
No record of
the Miller kid crossing.

17:12.196 --> 17:14.337
I went back a couple of months
to be sure.

17:14.365 --> 17:16.265
You get anything
from the vehicle?

17:16.300 --> 17:18.540
It's a trap car.

17:18.569 --> 17:20.640
Looks like our OD
was possibly smuggling.

17:20.672 --> 17:23.071
A Mennonite, smuggling drugs?

17:32.717 --> 17:34.187
You there?

17:34.219 --> 17:36.319
Yeah, could you... can you...

17:36.354 --> 17:37.754
Could you email me those logs

17:37.789 --> 17:40.289
so that I can take a look
at them myself?

17:40.325 --> 17:42.225
Yeah, you got it.

17:49.434 --> 17:52.504
Hey, Jenna.

17:52.537 --> 17:54.577
It's bad, right?

17:56.174 --> 17:57.144
I mean...

17:57.175 --> 17:58.145
My God.

17:58.176 --> 17:59.346
Can you please help me?

17:59.377 --> 18:01.817
I... I have this job interview...

18:01.846 --> 18:03.257
I mean, I think
it's a job interview.

18:03.281 --> 18:04.525
I'm pretty sure it is. It's at...

18:04.549 --> 18:06.349
It's at Bill Boone Motors.

18:06.384 --> 18:07.584
Really?

18:07.619 --> 18:10.819
Your dad's not a fan of Bill's,
right?

18:10.855 --> 18:12.595
They've always kind of
had their problems.

18:12.624 --> 18:15.464
I'll tell Thomas
about it if the time comes.

18:15.493 --> 18:16.737
I haven't even
gotten the job yet.

18:16.761 --> 18:19.131
What would you do, sell cars?

18:19.164 --> 18:20.908
I think so. Either that,
or I could, you know,

18:20.932 --> 18:23.872
refill the coffee
and snack machines.

18:23.902 --> 18:25.279
At least I have experience
doing that.

18:25.303 --> 18:27.673
Could you hand me that shirt?

18:29.507 --> 18:32.247
Hey, what happened...
What happened to your hand?

18:32.277 --> 18:34.147
I-I burned myself.

18:34.179 --> 18:35.919
It was stupid.
I wasn't thinking.

18:35.947 --> 18:37.925
Are you okay? You want me
to put some aloe on that?

18:37.949 --> 18:39.919
No, it's fine.

18:43.788 --> 18:45.688
I could really use your help.

18:45.723 --> 18:47.463
I can't wear any of this stuff

18:47.492 --> 18:49.170
if I want to have a shot
at getting this job.

18:49.194 --> 18:51.664
Would you... would you
go shopping with me?

18:51.696 --> 18:54.936
We'd get out of the house
for a while.

18:54.966 --> 18:57.806
No, thanks.
I'm not feeling great.

18:57.835 --> 19:00.575
It won't take long, I promise.

19:00.605 --> 19:02.345
I would ask Henry, but

19:02.373 --> 19:04.273
black hoodies and sarcasm
were never my thing,

19:04.309 --> 19:06.549
even in the '90s.

19:08.646 --> 19:11.586
Wait, so Henry Coles
was with you?

19:11.616 --> 19:13.216
Yeah.

19:13.251 --> 19:14.751
We were...

19:14.786 --> 19:15.786
You know.

19:17.322 --> 19:18.432
But yeah, after that,
I don't know.

19:18.456 --> 19:19.926
I guess I don't really

19:19.958 --> 19:21.898
remember much.

19:21.926 --> 19:24.266
At least you remember
the good shit.

19:24.295 --> 19:25.935
So you don't...

19:25.964 --> 19:28.234
You don't remember getting hit?

19:28.266 --> 19:30.866
Yeah, I get, like,
flashes here and there.

19:30.902 --> 19:33.242
Doctor says short-term
memory loss is normal,

19:33.271 --> 19:34.741
but... but it can come back.

19:34.772 --> 19:36.412
There's, like,

19:36.441 --> 19:38.341
like, triggers or whatever.

19:38.376 --> 19:40.846
Man, that's so messed up.

19:44.282 --> 19:46.882
Yeah, so, Lincoln fucked up
the girls' bathroom?

19:46.918 --> 19:48.458
- Yeah.
- What's up with that, dude?

19:48.486 --> 19:50.386
- Worst prank ever.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

19:50.421 --> 19:51.699
Yeah, man, we're gonna
hit 'em back, though.

19:51.723 --> 19:52.766
We got something good planned,
too.

19:52.790 --> 19:54.330
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

19:54.359 --> 19:56.759
I mean,
it's no Lindsay Morgan, but...

19:56.794 --> 20:00.634
Shit, I forgot about that.

20:00.665 --> 20:01.809
How long you'd have to date her?

20:01.833 --> 20:02.933
Three months before

20:02.967 --> 20:04.907
I got her to send nudes.

20:04.936 --> 20:06.006
Right?

20:06.037 --> 20:08.507
That's not really a prank.

20:08.539 --> 20:10.479
Bro, what are you talking about?

20:10.508 --> 20:12.808
Her brother was
Lincoln's fucking team captain.

20:12.844 --> 20:15.514
He lost his mind
when I sent him those pics.

20:15.546 --> 20:17.886
Dude couldn't shoot for shit.

20:17.915 --> 20:19.785
We crushed them.

20:19.817 --> 20:23.827
It was still kind of fucked-up.

20:23.855 --> 20:26.925
Yo, dude, are you okay?

20:26.958 --> 20:29.328
Yeah, um,

20:29.360 --> 20:30.360
yeah, it's just hot.

20:30.395 --> 20:32.995
I'm just a little hot.

20:33.031 --> 20:35.271
Everything okay?

20:35.300 --> 20:38.270
Yeah, it's just a little warm
in here.

20:38.303 --> 20:40.473
I'll check the thermostat.

20:40.505 --> 20:42.475
But you've got to
get ready for PT

20:42.507 --> 20:43.977
and I still need
those blood samples

20:44.008 --> 20:46.048
for Dr. Halpert,
so I gotta kick you boys out.

20:46.077 --> 20:48.317
Still got 20 minutes, though.

20:48.346 --> 20:50.616
You can come back tomorrow.

20:50.648 --> 20:52.048
Catch you later, man.

20:52.083 --> 20:53.853
- Yeah, later man.
- Yeah, later, bro.

20:53.885 --> 20:54.885
See you, bro.

20:54.919 --> 20:55.889
Yo, feel better soon.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.660
Thanks.

20:59.524 --> 21:01.694
I started sweating.

21:01.726 --> 21:03.996
Don't worry.
We'll figure out what's wrong.

21:04.028 --> 21:05.072
Yeah, I'm gonna
take a look at your legs.

21:05.096 --> 21:07.296
All right. Okay.

21:14.105 --> 21:15.805
You had an accident.

21:15.840 --> 21:17.980
It happens while your body's
still adjusting.

21:18.009 --> 21:20.879
Make sure you stick
to your bowel program.

21:20.912 --> 21:22.582
Okay?

21:22.613 --> 21:24.653
Let's get you cleaned up.

21:33.124 --> 21:36.694
Hello?

21:36.728 --> 21:39.728
Jenna?

21:39.764 --> 21:43.034
Mom?

21:43.067 --> 21:45.307
It's just us.

21:47.071 --> 21:48.941
What are you doing?

21:48.973 --> 21:50.643
We're inside.

21:54.679 --> 21:57.849
Ready.

21:57.882 --> 22:00.482
Okay.

22:00.518 --> 22:02.429
Remember, the first thing
you should do is call me.

22:02.453 --> 22:06.023
I'll map your location
and find a way to get to you.

22:06.057 --> 22:07.127
What's that?

22:07.158 --> 22:08.358
My allowance,

22:08.393 --> 22:09.463
in case something happens

22:09.494 --> 22:10.464
or you need a way to get back.

22:10.495 --> 22:12.435
There's $283 there.

22:12.463 --> 22:13.933
This is a bad idea.

22:13.965 --> 22:15.665
Nope, this is preparation.

22:15.700 --> 22:19.440
Smoking marijuana is a bad idea.

22:19.470 --> 22:22.440
Here, this will record your
heart rate and blood pressure

22:22.473 --> 22:24.773
so we have a better sense
of what happens right before.

22:24.809 --> 22:26.479
Also, you should...

22:26.511 --> 22:30.651
You should keep your jacket on,
just in case.

22:30.681 --> 22:33.921
And here's some sunscreen

22:33.951 --> 22:37.991
and an energy bar.

22:38.022 --> 22:40.162
You got a parachute
and scuba gear, too?

22:40.191 --> 22:41.561
No, I don't have those.

22:41.592 --> 22:42.662
Now lie down.

22:46.898 --> 22:49.638
You're not going to leave me,
are you?

22:49.667 --> 22:51.767
I have nowhere else to go.

22:55.206 --> 22:58.446
My sister uses this when she
travels, if you want to borrow it.

22:58.476 --> 23:00.796
You can't keep it, though.
You... you have to give it back.

24:26.931 --> 24:28.571
Wow. Wow.

24:28.599 --> 24:29.869
Shit.

24:29.901 --> 24:32.141
What happened? Where did you go?

24:32.169 --> 24:35.269
It was the same place
as last time.

24:35.306 --> 24:37.806
I'm pretty sure
it was a storage closet.

24:40.111 --> 24:42.051
I don't know, though.

24:42.079 --> 24:43.919
There was a picture of a...

24:43.948 --> 24:45.218
Of a little girl.

24:45.249 --> 24:46.989
Another teleporter?

24:47.018 --> 24:48.718
I don't know. I don't think so.

24:48.753 --> 24:50.163
If your body's taking you
to the same place,

24:50.187 --> 24:51.727
there's got to be a reason.

24:51.756 --> 24:52.866
Maybe there are others
like you there.

24:52.890 --> 24:54.560
You have to go back.

24:54.592 --> 24:56.162
Fuck that.

24:56.193 --> 24:58.633
There was somebody
on the other side of that door,

24:58.663 --> 25:00.763
and I'm pretty sure
that they had a gun, so no.

25:00.798 --> 25:01.768
Makes sense.

25:01.799 --> 25:03.299
Facilities that house people

25:03.334 --> 25:04.574
with heightened abilities

25:04.602 --> 25:06.702
tend to have high security.

25:06.737 --> 25:08.277
It's not a fucking

25:08.306 --> 25:09.906
magic science lab, Townes.

25:09.941 --> 25:10.911
Well, you don't know that.

25:10.942 --> 25:12.142
What if that little girl

25:12.176 --> 25:13.746
in the picture needs your help?

25:13.778 --> 25:14.778
She could be in trouble.

25:14.812 --> 25:17.652
Jesus Christ.

25:17.682 --> 25:19.182
- Hey!
- Stop it. You can't keep

25:19.216 --> 25:20.794
- trying to escape this.
- Townes, it's just...

25:20.818 --> 25:22.688
You're a superhero.
This is your duty.

25:22.720 --> 25:25.120
For the last
motherfucking time, Townes,

25:25.156 --> 25:27.026
I'm not a fucking superhero,
okay?

25:27.058 --> 25:28.335
- But you are...
- Shut the fuck up!

25:28.359 --> 25:30.829
Just shut up!

25:30.861 --> 25:32.101
Do you think this is fun?

25:32.129 --> 25:33.729
You weren't in the car!

25:33.764 --> 25:34.934
You weren't there when he...

25:34.966 --> 25:36.766
What car?

25:38.903 --> 25:40.243
You just...

25:40.271 --> 25:41.841
You're...

25:41.872 --> 25:42.912
You're not...

25:42.940 --> 25:44.740
You're not my sidekick.

25:44.775 --> 25:47.345
We're not even friends.
We barely know each other,

25:47.378 --> 25:49.878
and by the way,
this isn't a game to me.

25:49.914 --> 25:51.914
This is my life.
This is real for me.

25:51.949 --> 25:54.049
Do you understand that?

25:54.085 --> 25:57.055
Yeah. Yes.

25:59.256 --> 26:00.956
Townes...

26:00.992 --> 26:03.162
Okay, I just...

26:03.194 --> 26:04.794
- Townes...
- Yes.

26:04.829 --> 26:06.099
Okay, Townes, just...

26:06.130 --> 26:08.600
Townes, please wait
for a second.

26:08.633 --> 26:11.103
Just...

26:11.135 --> 26:13.605
Fuck.

26:13.638 --> 26:15.338
Would you buy a car from me?

26:17.174 --> 26:19.744
A mid-range sedan, maybe.

26:19.777 --> 26:20.877
Mid-range?

26:20.911 --> 26:22.681
How about this extended-cab,

26:22.713 --> 26:24.253
fully-loaded semitruck?

26:24.281 --> 26:25.921
Do you even know
what that means?

26:25.950 --> 26:27.620
No, not at all.

26:27.652 --> 26:29.722
Of course not.

26:29.754 --> 26:31.254
Is it too booby?

26:31.288 --> 26:34.088
It's perfectly booby.

26:34.125 --> 26:36.365
I just want Henry
to be proud of me.

26:36.394 --> 26:37.764
Does that sound silly?

26:37.795 --> 26:40.135
I know it does, but...

26:40.164 --> 26:42.704
Sometimes I think she's,
you know,

26:42.733 --> 26:44.233
ashamed of... anyway,

26:44.268 --> 26:47.368
um, this is going to be good.

26:47.405 --> 26:49.345
Just get it so we can go.

26:54.445 --> 26:56.915
Honey, are you okay?

26:56.947 --> 26:59.047
I'm fine.

26:59.083 --> 27:00.093
You're not fine. What's wrong?

27:00.117 --> 27:01.887
No, really, I'm fine.

27:01.919 --> 27:04.659
I just don't want to be here.
I want to go home.

27:05.823 --> 27:08.793
Okay, I'll go get my things.

27:08.826 --> 27:11.066
I...

27:11.095 --> 27:13.295
It really does look nice.

27:15.800 --> 27:18.340
I'd buy, like, a really
expensive car from you.

27:21.872 --> 27:23.972
Come here.

27:33.150 --> 27:35.350
Why didn't you
go to school today?

27:37.288 --> 27:39.388
This was the day

27:39.423 --> 27:41.893
that my mom was diagnosed.

27:47.865 --> 27:50.335
She... she pulled me out of school

27:50.367 --> 27:54.207
and told me it was
family fun day.

27:57.074 --> 27:59.444
We went ice skating,
and we went...

27:59.477 --> 28:01.047
We went to the movies

28:01.078 --> 28:05.418
and played Parcheesi
and ordered pizza.

28:08.052 --> 28:10.852
And then

28:10.888 --> 28:12.388
after dinner,

28:12.423 --> 28:15.193
she told us she was sick.

28:15.226 --> 28:18.066
Early-onset Alzheimer's.

28:18.095 --> 28:20.765
She didn't want us to worry.

28:20.798 --> 28:23.498
She said she wanted to have one

28:23.534 --> 28:26.434
perfect day before she forgot.

28:26.470 --> 28:28.840
Why isn't your dad
with you today?

28:28.873 --> 28:32.173
Sometimes I think he doesn't
want to talk about her.

28:32.209 --> 28:35.209
He talks about her all the time.

28:35.246 --> 28:37.746
Talks about the two of you,

28:37.782 --> 28:40.052
his mad scientists.

28:40.084 --> 28:43.954
Talks about how you used to spend
hours in the kitchen, baking,

28:43.988 --> 28:47.928
mixing ingredients and coming
up with secret recipes.

28:47.958 --> 28:50.758
That's why I fell in love
with him.

28:50.795 --> 28:53.495
Just the way he talked about
the two of you.

28:53.531 --> 28:57.131
He said you used to make
something called a cocoa...

28:57.168 --> 28:58.868
Cocoa-doodle surprise.

28:58.903 --> 29:00.773
Cocoa-doodle surprise.

29:00.805 --> 29:02.805
That's what I tried
to make today.

29:02.840 --> 29:04.910
What is a cocoa-doodle surprise?

29:04.942 --> 29:08.112
It's snickerdoodles
with chocolate chips.

29:08.145 --> 29:10.415
That's it.

29:10.447 --> 29:12.287
I thought I invented it.

29:12.316 --> 29:14.156
Then my mom...

29:14.185 --> 29:18.425
She didn't want me to know
it was from a recipe, so

29:18.455 --> 29:20.825
she suggested the name.

29:20.858 --> 29:23.758
She sounds like
an amazing woman.

29:26.397 --> 29:29.337
She was.

30:19.650 --> 30:21.950
Eddie, I can't believe
you drink this shit.

30:21.986 --> 30:26.896
What do you drink?

30:26.924 --> 30:29.594
Chilean reds, mostly.

30:29.627 --> 30:33.597
So, what are you gonna do
when you get out of here?

30:33.631 --> 30:37.431
I don't know. Go back to work.

30:37.468 --> 30:40.368
You think Bill's
gonna hire you back?

30:40.404 --> 30:42.174
Even after what you did to Clay?

30:42.206 --> 30:44.346
I didn't...

30:44.375 --> 30:45.615
Look,

30:45.643 --> 30:47.113
I don't know what he's gonna do,

30:47.144 --> 30:48.584
but Bill is
an understanding guy.

30:48.612 --> 30:53.352
What about Jeremiah Miller?
Is he as understanding?

30:54.685 --> 30:56.885
I don't know who that is.

30:56.921 --> 30:58.621
From the Miller farm.

30:58.656 --> 31:01.396
Doesn't Boone Motors
do a lot of business with him?

31:01.425 --> 31:03.625
No.

31:03.661 --> 31:05.501
Yeah.

31:05.529 --> 31:07.629
I mean, we buy used cars
from there,

31:07.665 --> 31:10.165
but I'm just the driver.

31:13.203 --> 31:15.003
I gotta go.

31:15.039 --> 31:16.439
Wait.

31:20.177 --> 31:22.077
Thanks for the company, Eddie.

31:27.084 --> 31:29.384
Somebody grab him!

31:36.961 --> 31:38.961
Okay. My God, these nails.

31:38.996 --> 31:40.366
- No, no.
- Is that okay?

31:40.397 --> 31:42.337
It'll be okay. Just hide them.

31:44.234 --> 31:46.034
They're fine.
You're just nervous.

31:46.070 --> 31:47.170
Did you guys, like,

31:47.204 --> 31:48.704
go shopping or something?

31:48.739 --> 31:50.539
Jenna helped me out.

31:50.574 --> 31:52.944
Okay. I gotta run. Wish me luck.

31:52.977 --> 31:54.277
- Good luck.
- Okay.

31:54.311 --> 31:57.281
I don't even know
what you're doing, so...

31:57.314 --> 31:59.014
I have a job interview,

31:59.049 --> 32:00.349
but I don't want to jinx it,

32:00.384 --> 32:01.428
so I'll talk to you about it
when I get home.

32:01.452 --> 32:03.192
I love you.

32:03.220 --> 32:05.090
Bye.

32:11.628 --> 32:15.128
You shouldn't do that.

32:15.165 --> 32:17.565
What?

32:17.601 --> 32:19.201
Push your mom away. She's...

32:19.236 --> 32:21.276
She's trying to help.

32:23.407 --> 32:26.007
So you spent a few hours

32:26.043 --> 32:27.483
trying on clothes with my mom

32:27.511 --> 32:28.551
and now you think

32:28.579 --> 32:30.949
you know my whole fucking life.

32:32.449 --> 32:35.989
All I'm saying is, she's here.

32:36.020 --> 32:39.560
Don't you have
some more cookies to burn?

32:39.590 --> 32:40.734
You know,
you're not the only one

32:40.758 --> 32:43.028
who has shit to deal with.

32:43.060 --> 32:45.000
I'm sorry.

32:45.029 --> 32:46.669
Are you unable to sleep

32:46.697 --> 32:49.137
because you're teleporting
to a scary-ass place at night?

32:49.166 --> 32:51.106
No, but at least I give a shit

32:51.135 --> 32:52.405
about what's happening to you.

32:52.436 --> 32:53.436
You don't even ask me.

32:53.470 --> 32:56.510
And today's the day my m...

32:58.242 --> 32:59.442
I just...

33:00.711 --> 33:02.681
I've been having a hard day,
too.

33:02.713 --> 33:05.413
And you should tell Cleo
what's going on with you,

33:05.449 --> 33:07.189
because she's here

33:07.217 --> 33:09.317
and you don't have to
go through this alone,

33:09.353 --> 33:11.623
and that's something.
That's a lot.

33:14.058 --> 33:16.198
You don't give your mom
enough credit.

33:31.175 --> 33:32.745
Hey, guys. I'm Clay Boone.

33:32.776 --> 33:34.776
After my accident, I...

33:38.849 --> 33:41.219
I'm not doing this.

33:41.251 --> 33:44.091
Clay, the video
is the most important part.

33:44.121 --> 33:46.061
Once people see you,
they'll donate more.

33:46.090 --> 33:47.790
We don't need the money.

33:47.825 --> 33:49.665
Everybody needs the money, Clay.

33:49.693 --> 33:53.763
Hospitals are, like,
insanely expensive.

33:53.797 --> 33:55.797
People want to help.

33:58.469 --> 34:00.069
Can you come here for a sec?

34:04.408 --> 34:06.148
Hey.

34:08.145 --> 34:10.215
I miss you.

34:11.748 --> 34:12.717
Clay...

34:12.748 --> 34:14.219
Everybody's gone.

34:14.251 --> 34:18.251
Evening meds aren't
for another few hours.

34:18.288 --> 34:21.788
It's just you and me.
We have some time.

34:21.824 --> 34:25.065
Come on, for old times' sake.

34:26.362 --> 34:28.163
I'm going crazy in here.

34:28.197 --> 34:29.498
I don't think so.

34:33.871 --> 34:36.210
Why are you even here?

34:36.239 --> 34:37.370
The Kickstarter, Clay.

34:37.407 --> 34:39.377
Right.

34:39.409 --> 34:41.748
So you can pat yourself
on the back, then.

34:41.777 --> 34:43.478
Did something real nice
for the cripple.

34:43.514 --> 34:45.114
Must feel good about yourself.

34:45.149 --> 34:47.649
Are you kidding me?

34:47.684 --> 34:50.123
You cheated on me, Clay,

34:50.154 --> 34:51.654
so no, I'm not

34:51.688 --> 34:53.558
feeling really good
about myself right now,

34:53.590 --> 34:55.790
but I'm here because
I'm still your friend.

34:55.826 --> 34:59.596
Your friendship isn't
what I want.

34:59.630 --> 35:00.773
You're an asshole.
You know that?

35:00.797 --> 35:03.537
Well,
you're a fucking lousy lay.

35:03.567 --> 35:05.737
At least I can still get laid.

35:05.769 --> 35:08.509
Good luck with that.

35:14.411 --> 35:17.151
Hey.
Someone's been experimenting.

35:22.452 --> 35:25.192
I burned them all.

35:25.222 --> 35:27.162
What were you trying to make?

35:30.527 --> 35:34.367
Cocoa-doodle surprise.

35:34.398 --> 35:36.298
For Mom.

35:40.604 --> 35:43.844
I thought you'd remember
the date.

35:47.744 --> 35:49.684
January seventh.

35:53.417 --> 35:55.417
That's...

35:55.452 --> 35:57.852
That's when Mom told me.

35:57.888 --> 36:00.728
I...

36:00.757 --> 36:04.227
I just have a different day.

36:04.261 --> 36:07.301
And we didn't tell you
for a while because...

36:12.836 --> 36:17.206
You got any more cookie dough?

36:17.241 --> 36:20.281
I used it all, but

36:20.310 --> 36:23.210
it's an easy recipe.

36:23.247 --> 36:25.947
Time to get to work, kid.

36:28.785 --> 36:31.385
So it's a little long.
I'm sorry.

36:31.421 --> 36:33.321
You know what?
I don't need this.

36:33.357 --> 36:34.657
I...

36:34.691 --> 36:36.331
I thought this was
a job interview.

36:36.360 --> 36:37.604
I'm... I'm sorry.
I must have misunderstood.

36:37.628 --> 36:39.268
No, I don't need
a piece of paper

36:39.296 --> 36:42.366
to tell me about someone,
or four.

36:42.399 --> 36:43.999
I want someone I can trust,

36:44.034 --> 36:45.504
and what I saw today
at the diner

36:45.535 --> 36:46.813
was a testament
to your character.

36:46.837 --> 36:47.907
That's why I want you

36:47.938 --> 36:50.708
on my sales team.

36:50.741 --> 36:52.711
Are you offering me a job?

36:52.743 --> 36:54.387
Now, you don't have to make a decision now.
Take as much...

36:54.411 --> 36:55.911
No, no, no, I want it.

36:55.946 --> 36:58.446
I mean, I would...
I would love to work here.

36:58.482 --> 37:01.352
Great. We'll get you set up
first thing in the morning,

37:01.385 --> 37:02.355
so you can hit the road running,

37:02.386 --> 37:03.926
but in the meantime,

37:03.954 --> 37:05.324
- try to get the basics.
- My gosh.

37:05.355 --> 37:06.755
- Okay? You'll do great.
- Okay.

37:06.790 --> 37:07.860
Ooh. New suit?

37:07.891 --> 37:11.691
My God. I'm...

37:11.728 --> 37:13.606
I figured I could take it back
if I didn't get the job.

37:13.630 --> 37:15.030
I'm s... so embarrassed.

37:15.065 --> 37:17.465
You know what? Hold on.

37:17.501 --> 37:18.941
No need to be embarrassed.

37:25.075 --> 37:26.745
No, no, no, I...

37:26.777 --> 37:28.677
I... I told you,
I don't do charity.

37:28.712 --> 37:29.952
This isn't charity.

37:29.980 --> 37:31.580
It's an investment.

37:31.615 --> 37:32.759
- That's...
- Okay? You're gonna need

37:32.783 --> 37:34.383
more than one suit.

37:34.418 --> 37:36.988
That's a lot of money.

37:37.020 --> 37:38.564
We're going to be
working together a long time.

37:38.588 --> 37:40.028
A few hundred dollars is nothing

37:40.057 --> 37:42.927
compared to what
you're gonna bring in.

37:44.328 --> 37:45.828
Well, I'll pay you back.

37:45.862 --> 37:47.762
You don't have to.

37:47.798 --> 37:49.498
Okay, you can pay me back.

37:49.533 --> 37:51.703
I know you're good for it.

37:53.036 --> 37:54.406
- Okay.
- Yeah.

37:54.438 --> 37:56.478
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

37:56.506 --> 37:57.506
Bright and early.

37:57.541 --> 37:58.941
Yeah.

38:36.847 --> 38:38.717
Easy, now.

38:38.749 --> 38:41.749
I don't want any trouble.

38:41.785 --> 38:43.755
Why don't we go for a drive?

38:54.931 --> 38:57.771
Okay.

38:57.801 --> 39:00.601
SPL-70 U joints.

39:00.637 --> 39:02.707
35 zipline axle shafts.

39:02.739 --> 39:03.839
Hey, Mom?

39:03.874 --> 39:05.514
Hey, honey.

39:05.542 --> 39:06.842
Do you have a second?

39:06.877 --> 39:08.747
There's just something
that I, um...

39:08.779 --> 39:10.149
I wanted to talk to you about.

39:10.180 --> 39:12.580
Sure. I could use a break.

39:12.616 --> 39:14.656
Is everything okay?

39:17.087 --> 39:19.687
Yeah, um, I...

39:20.924 --> 39:23.424
There's just this thing

39:23.460 --> 39:26.060
that I haven't, um...

39:26.096 --> 39:27.866
What thing?

39:27.898 --> 39:29.898
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

39:34.438 --> 39:36.358
What is that? Why do you...
why do you have that?

39:37.974 --> 39:39.714
I got a new job.

39:39.743 --> 39:41.983
You are looking at

39:42.012 --> 39:43.112
the newest saleswoman

39:43.146 --> 39:46.446
at Bill Boone Motors.

39:46.483 --> 39:48.723
- What?
- I know, isn't it great?

39:48.752 --> 39:50.922
Of course,
I have to learn 152 pages

39:50.954 --> 39:54.824
of this by tomorrow.

39:54.858 --> 39:57.528
I'm sorry, you're going to
work for Bill Boone?

39:59.463 --> 40:00.633
No, I'm just...

40:00.664 --> 40:01.664
I mean, do you think that

40:01.698 --> 40:03.968
that's, like, a good idea?

40:04.000 --> 40:06.070
Well, I mean, I know,

40:06.102 --> 40:08.114
I know what people say about him,
but he's really not that bad,

40:08.138 --> 40:11.708
and you know, he could use the
extra help right now, especially...

40:11.741 --> 40:14.711
He's got a lot on his plate
with Clay.

40:14.744 --> 40:17.484
Right.

40:17.514 --> 40:20.984
Honey, I am doing this for you.

40:21.017 --> 40:22.628
We're not gonna have to
worry about medical bills

40:22.652 --> 40:23.822
or missing appointments.

40:23.854 --> 40:25.054
You need me.

40:25.088 --> 40:26.188
We need each other,

40:26.223 --> 40:27.523
and I know I haven't been there,

40:27.557 --> 40:30.757
not nearly enough, and now,

40:30.794 --> 40:33.664
I mean, you can tell...
Tell people that your mom's

40:33.697 --> 40:36.237
a saleswoman and not a waitress.

40:36.266 --> 40:38.766
Mom, I've never...

40:38.802 --> 40:42.742
I've never cared about that.

40:42.772 --> 40:43.742
Well, sure, no, I...

40:43.773 --> 40:46.743
Me either. I just...

40:46.776 --> 40:48.046
Hey, I'm...

40:48.078 --> 40:51.548
I'm really proud of you.

40:51.581 --> 40:52.621
Yeah?

40:52.649 --> 40:54.249
Yeah. That's great.

40:54.284 --> 40:57.054
Don't tell Thomas just...
Just yet.

40:57.087 --> 40:58.657
Okay.

40:58.688 --> 40:59.828
Hey, I'm sorry. What is it

40:59.856 --> 41:02.726
you wanted to talk to me about?

41:02.759 --> 41:04.259
It's nothing.

41:04.294 --> 41:06.934
We agreed, no secrets.

41:06.963 --> 41:10.563
I know. I'm just, um...

41:10.600 --> 41:12.270
I'm very tired.
I didn't actually

41:12.302 --> 41:13.902
sleep at all last night

41:13.937 --> 41:15.147
while I was up late, studying,
so...

41:15.171 --> 41:16.141
You sure?

41:16.172 --> 41:18.872
Yeah.

41:18.909 --> 41:21.049
Okay, well,
I'm here if you need me.

41:21.077 --> 41:24.847
- Okay.
- Get some rest, sweetheart.

42:28.044 --> 42:30.844
Man.

42:30.880 --> 42:32.850
What's up?

42:32.882 --> 42:34.752
Pop wanted to

42:34.784 --> 42:36.584
make sure you got
some real food in you.

42:36.620 --> 42:39.320
Thanks.

42:43.893 --> 42:46.693
Here.

42:46.730 --> 42:48.630
What are you doing?

42:48.665 --> 42:49.905
It's ketchup.

42:49.933 --> 42:50.903
Yeah, I know what it is.
I don't need you

42:50.934 --> 42:51.974
to do that for me.

42:52.002 --> 42:55.072
My hands still fucking work.

42:55.105 --> 42:56.315
- Yeah, I know that.
- I'm all-state.

42:56.339 --> 42:57.779
I have three district titles.

42:57.807 --> 42:59.877
I don't need your fucking help.

42:59.909 --> 43:01.079
I want to go home.

43:01.111 --> 43:02.981
Yeah, Clay, you will.

43:03.013 --> 43:04.056
A'ight, just a few more weeks
and then...

43:04.080 --> 43:06.120
No, tomorrow.

43:08.251 --> 43:10.651
Man, I really don't
think that's a good idea.

43:10.687 --> 43:11.797
You just started your rehab.

43:11.821 --> 43:13.061
Fucking call Dad and just

43:13.089 --> 43:15.889
tell him to get me the hell
out of here.

43:44.721 --> 43:47.721
Bill.

43:47.757 --> 43:49.357
We need to talk.

44:28.732 --> 44:31.032
Fuck me.

49:03.673 --> 49:05.173
You.

49:05.208 --> 49:07.208
You killed my wife.

49:07.243 --> 49:09.383
Let us go.

49:09.412 --> 49:11.452
I can't do that.

49:11.481 --> 49:15.181
Not up to me.

49:15.218 --> 49:16.518
Take me.

49:16.552 --> 49:19.322
Just let my son go, please.

49:19.355 --> 49:22.425
Let's start with you
putting the gun down.

49:24.093 --> 49:26.993
Do you know what
they'll do to him?

49:27.030 --> 49:29.300
I understand you're upset.

49:29.332 --> 49:32.202
He won't survive.

49:32.235 --> 49:34.105
He might not have the gene.

49:34.137 --> 49:36.207
Even if he does, it'll be years

49:36.239 --> 49:39.279
before his abilities develop.

49:39.308 --> 49:41.348
I'm offering you

49:41.377 --> 49:43.247
a future.

49:43.279 --> 49:45.449
You turn yourself in,

49:45.481 --> 49:47.451
you can help raise your son.

49:47.483 --> 49:49.223
You can still be a father.

49:50.753 --> 49:52.653
You'll have
a long time together.

49:53.723 --> 49:56.023
He's just a boy.

49:56.059 --> 49:58.259
And we'll take care of him.

49:58.294 --> 50:00.694
Along with you.
All you've got to do

50:00.730 --> 50:04.200
is come with us.
Don't fight this, trust me.

50:04.233 --> 50:05.333
Just let us go.

50:05.368 --> 50:08.308
That's not how this ends.

50:08.337 --> 50:09.807
You know that.

50:11.240 --> 50:13.140
Put the gun down

50:13.176 --> 50:14.446
and come with me.

50:39.635 --> 50:40.635
No, wait!
