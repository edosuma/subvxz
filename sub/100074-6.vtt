00:00.160 --> 00:01.890
- Previously
on "God Friended me"...

00:01.890 --> 00:03.900
- Audrey Grenelle has
a private art collection here.

00:04.060 --> 00:05.600
This image is made
entirely out of binary code.

00:06.100 --> 00:07.570
It could be a message
from the God Account.

00:07.770 --> 00:09.600
- This has to be where
the message is hidden.

00:09.600 --> 00:11.000
And the only person
who can give that to us is--

00:11.000 --> 00:12.400
- Audrey Grenelle.

00:12.400 --> 00:13.740
Bishop Thompson's
daughter Claire

00:13.740 --> 00:15.040
is my Friend Suggestion.

00:15.040 --> 00:16.670
- I'll be stepping down.

00:18.240 --> 00:20.350
- I know that you
don't want me getting involved

00:20.350 --> 00:21.610
in the church again.

00:21.610 --> 00:23.550
- Be honest with me about it.

00:23.550 --> 00:25.150
- They want you
to take my place

00:25.150 --> 00:27.920
as the bishop of New York.

00:31.390 --> 00:34.660
♪ I've been down this road ♪

00:34.660 --> 00:38.030

00:49.870 --> 00:51.140
- Dad.

00:51.140 --> 00:52.240
- Thanks for coming, Miles.

00:52.240 --> 00:53.750
- Of course.

00:53.750 --> 00:57.450
Just kind of curious why you
wanted me to meet you here

00:57.450 --> 01:00.250
in Bishop Thompson's
old office.

01:00.250 --> 01:01.750
- Because...

01:01.750 --> 01:03.860
this is going to be my office.

01:03.860 --> 01:07.730
The diocese would like me to be
the next bishop of New York.

01:07.730 --> 01:09.430
I've decided to accept.

01:09.430 --> 01:14.200
In two weeks,
I will be officially sworn in.

01:17.700 --> 01:19.270
Well...

01:19.270 --> 01:20.370
say something.

01:20.370 --> 01:22.270
- No, yeah, that's, um...

01:22.270 --> 01:24.810
That's great.

01:24.810 --> 01:28.410
I know this is what
you've always wanted.

01:29.280 --> 01:31.150
What does Trish think?

01:31.150 --> 01:33.020
- Hmm.

01:33.020 --> 01:34.250
Haven't told her yet.

01:34.250 --> 01:37.020
- Dad. D--
- I'm going to tell her.

01:37.020 --> 01:40.360
I made Trish promises when I
left Harlem Episcopal

01:40.360 --> 01:43.630
about the life
we were going to have.

01:45.360 --> 01:49.100
She may not react well
to the news.

01:49.100 --> 01:52.940
I have to find the right time.

01:52.940 --> 01:56.010
- So that's why
you called me down here.

01:56.010 --> 01:57.310
- Hmm?

01:57.310 --> 01:59.110
- So I would tell you
that it's okay

01:59.110 --> 02:00.610
and give you my approval.

02:00.610 --> 02:01.910
- I thought, of all people,
you'd understand.

02:01.910 --> 02:03.180
- Understand what?

02:03.180 --> 02:05.020
- Understand why
I have to do this.

02:05.020 --> 02:08.450
I saw how lost you were
without the God Account.

02:08.450 --> 02:11.360
After I left the church,
I felt the same.

02:11.360 --> 02:12.390
I mean,
whether we like it or not,

02:12.390 --> 02:13.890
we have a larger calling.

02:13.890 --> 02:15.930
- But Dad,

02:15.930 --> 02:21.500
if I had to pick between
Cara and the God Account...

02:21.500 --> 02:23.030
I would choose her.

02:27.340 --> 02:30.310
Look, I, um--
I have to go.

02:30.310 --> 02:32.040
I gotta get
to Ray Nicolette's barbecue.

02:32.040 --> 02:36.110
- Ray? Oh, Friend Suggestion
from last year.

02:36.110 --> 02:37.380
- Yeah.

02:37.380 --> 02:38.680
- You know what's ironic?

02:38.680 --> 02:40.020
If the God Account
hadn't sent you

02:40.020 --> 02:42.690
a Friend Suggestion
for Claire Thompson,

02:42.690 --> 02:44.960
I wouldn't be standing here.

02:47.830 --> 02:51.230
- Ooh. This heat is really bad
for these brownies.

02:51.230 --> 02:54.060
Definitely should've gone with
tinfoil instead of Saran Wrap.

02:54.060 --> 02:56.830
Rookie mistake.

02:58.800 --> 03:00.340
What's going on, Miles?

03:00.340 --> 03:02.070
You've said, like, two words
since you picked me up.

03:02.070 --> 03:05.780
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm just--I'm just thinking.

03:05.780 --> 03:10.780
My dad is going to be
the bishop of New York.

03:11.580 --> 03:12.750
- Wait, are you serious?

03:12.750 --> 03:13.920
- Yeah.

03:13.920 --> 03:15.550
Told me this morning.

03:15.550 --> 03:17.720
- Well, that's great, right?

03:17.720 --> 03:19.690
- Honestly, I don't know.

03:19.690 --> 03:21.260
- Why do I get the sense

03:21.260 --> 03:23.030
that's not the only
thing bothering you?

03:23.030 --> 03:25.300
- 'Cause it was something
that he said.

03:25.300 --> 03:27.830
If the God Account
hadn't sent us Claire's name,

03:27.830 --> 03:29.730
he wouldn't be bishop.

03:29.730 --> 03:31.100
- So you think the God Account

03:31.100 --> 03:32.800
wanted your dad to become
bishop of New York?

03:32.800 --> 03:34.770
- Is that really
such a crazy idea?

03:34.770 --> 03:35.840
- Why would it want that?

03:35.840 --> 03:37.510
- I don't know.

03:37.510 --> 03:39.340
But there's something bigger
happening with the God Account,

03:39.340 --> 03:40.980
and I want to know
what it has planned for me.

03:40.980 --> 03:43.880
- Yeah, I know. And we will.

03:43.880 --> 03:46.280
But right now...

03:46.280 --> 03:47.890
brownies?

03:47.890 --> 03:50.050
Happy face?

03:50.050 --> 03:52.090
Ray's barbecue, okay?

03:53.090 --> 03:54.230
- Okay.
- All right.

03:54.230 --> 03:56.530
- Okay.
- Come on.

04:00.100 --> 04:01.630
- Baby, look at that.

04:01.630 --> 04:03.030
Aha!

04:03.030 --> 04:04.270
Wasn't sure you kids
were gonna make it.

04:04.270 --> 04:05.340
- Ah, come on.

04:05.340 --> 04:06.970
It's been a year
since you took Isaac in.

04:06.970 --> 04:08.140
We weren't gonna miss this.

04:08.140 --> 04:09.640
It's a huge milestone.

04:09.640 --> 04:11.540
- Okay, still not a hugger.

04:11.540 --> 04:14.580
Hey, why don't you put
them brownies on the cooler?

04:14.580 --> 04:16.250
Maybe we don't
share those right away.

04:16.250 --> 04:17.050
Yeah?

04:17.050 --> 04:18.980
- So where's Isaac?

04:18.980 --> 04:20.480
- He's throwing the football
with some friends.

04:20.480 --> 04:21.850
He'll be back.

04:21.850 --> 04:23.250
- Nice. How's he doing?
- He's great.

04:23.250 --> 04:24.990
You know, I knew the kid
was smarter than me,

04:24.990 --> 04:26.260
but now I get a report card

04:26.260 --> 04:27.730
every three months
to prove I t.

04:27.730 --> 04:28.760
- You guys have come
a long way.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.230
- Well, right back at you.

04:31.430 --> 04:32.900
Well, it took you two
long enough to realize

04:32.900 --> 04:35.470
you were a good match.

04:35.470 --> 04:37.470
How'd you know we were dating?

04:37.470 --> 04:39.300
- Oh, the kid's got me
listening to podcasts.

04:39.300 --> 04:42.440
I figured I'd check out
the Millennial Prophet, here.

04:42.440 --> 04:44.580
Paris sounded like
one hell of a trip.

04:44.580 --> 04:46.340
Did you ever figure out
what that painting means?

04:46.340 --> 04:48.180
- No. There's a woman
who may have answers,

04:48.180 --> 04:49.750
but she's proven hard to find.

04:49.750 --> 04:51.620
- Mm.

04:51.620 --> 04:52.820
- Ray.

04:52.820 --> 04:54.720
You're good at finding people.

04:54.720 --> 04:56.050
Any chance you want to help?

04:56.050 --> 04:58.860
- Sure. I love pro bono work.

04:58.860 --> 05:00.720
What's her name?
- Audrey Grenelle.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.160
- That's a good name.

05:02.160 --> 05:04.030
Yeah, I'll let you know
if I find anything.

05:04.030 --> 05:06.100
- All right. Great.
Um...

05:06.100 --> 05:09.170
I'm gonna go
get us some punch.

05:17.470 --> 05:19.940
Sorry to disappoint you,
but some kid just ran off

05:19.940 --> 05:22.650
with the rest of Barbara's
famous party punch.

05:22.650 --> 05:23.950
- Oh, I work with Barbara.

05:23.950 --> 05:25.480
Trust me.
We dodged a bullet.

05:26.950 --> 05:28.490
- I'm Miles.

05:28.490 --> 05:29.950
- Elena. Nice to meet you.

05:29.950 --> 05:31.820
- So how do you know
Isaac and Ray?

05:31.820 --> 05:33.360
- I'm a social worker.

05:33.360 --> 05:35.330
A few of us here used to work
with his late wife, Abby.

05:35.330 --> 05:36.860
How about you?

05:36.860 --> 05:39.800
- Actually, I played a hand in
Isaac coming to live with Ray.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.300
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

05:41.300 --> 05:42.830
- Ray was pretty lost
when Abby died,

05:42.830 --> 05:44.270
and then he met Isaac.

05:44.270 --> 05:46.870
So on behalf of everyone
that cares about Ray,

05:46.870 --> 05:48.110
thank you.

05:58.050 --> 06:00.620
- Elena, we really gotta go.

06:01.750 --> 06:05.920
- Miles, I'd like you to meet
my rude boyfriend, Austin.

06:05.920 --> 06:07.360
- Sorry about that.

06:07.360 --> 06:08.960
We just have things
that we need to do today.

06:08.960 --> 06:10.460
Right, Elena?

06:10.460 --> 06:12.060
- Right.

06:12.060 --> 06:15.370
Miles, enjoy the rest
of the party.

06:19.670 --> 06:21.240
- Hey. Where are those drinks?

06:21.240 --> 06:22.440
- Hey. Sorry.

06:22.440 --> 06:23.840
- You okay?

06:23.840 --> 06:25.680
- Yeah, yeah. I just met
that couple over there.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.140
Elena and Austin.

06:27.140 --> 06:29.650
She had this bruise on her arm,
and...I don't know.

06:29.650 --> 06:30.850
There was a weird vibe
between them.

06:30.850 --> 06:32.280
Something didn't feel right.

06:32.280 --> 06:34.790
- Well, maybe you're just
reading into things.

06:41.560 --> 06:42.890
- Or maybe I'm not.

06:54.270 --> 06:55.470
- Are you sure?

06:55.470 --> 06:57.210
- No, but the timing
of the Friend Suggestion

06:57.210 --> 06:58.640
is pretty hard to ignore.

06:58.640 --> 07:00.280
- Been around the God Account
a few times now,

07:00.280 --> 07:01.750
so if it sent you Elena's name,

07:01.750 --> 07:02.910
she obviously needs help.

07:02.910 --> 07:05.520
- How well do you know Austin?

07:06.050 --> 07:07.350
- I knew
she was dating someone,

07:07.350 --> 07:09.890
but I never met him
until today.

07:11.120 --> 07:12.360
I'll see what I can find out.

07:12.360 --> 07:13.760
- Hey, thanks, Ray.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.230
Look, I hope that I'm wrong.

07:15.230 --> 07:17.930
- You know,
Elena and Abby were close.

07:17.930 --> 07:20.760
I mean, she was with us
right until the end.

07:22.170 --> 07:24.000
I hope you're wrong as well.

07:25.400 --> 07:27.940
- So what do you know
about this guy Austin?

07:27.940 --> 07:29.070
- Look, we don't know
anything for sure,

07:29.070 --> 07:30.640
and Ray's doing his cop thing.

07:30.640 --> 07:33.580
We just need to know
as much as possible about him.

07:33.580 --> 07:34.680
- Yeah. On it.

07:34.680 --> 07:35.910
Besides, I need a distraction

07:35.910 --> 07:37.050
from checking Jaya's
Facebook page,

07:37.050 --> 07:38.620
like, every five minutes.

07:38.620 --> 07:41.690
- Oh, yeah. Miles told me about
the, un--the fake breakup.

07:41.690 --> 07:43.020
Are you fake okay?

07:43.020 --> 07:44.460
- I mean, I was,

07:44.460 --> 07:46.120
until she changed
her relationship status

07:46.120 --> 07:47.690
to "single," and I know
we both agreed to do it,

07:47.690 --> 07:51.730
but seeing it just makes it
so much more real.

07:52.400 --> 07:53.900
Okay, here we go.

07:53.900 --> 07:55.330
Um, there's actually

07:55.330 --> 07:57.270
a whole bunch of articles
on Austin Reynolds.

07:57.270 --> 07:59.340
He was a professional
MMA fighter

07:59.340 --> 08:01.610
until he suffered
a career-ending injury.

08:01.610 --> 08:02.970
- Hmm.

08:03.940 --> 08:05.880
Hey. Did you find anything?

08:05.880 --> 08:06.940
- Not much.

08:06.940 --> 08:08.380
Austin's record is clean,

08:08.380 --> 08:10.950
but I dealt with abuse cases
when I was a cop,

08:10.950 --> 08:12.950
so I had a friend do me a favor

08:12.950 --> 08:15.550
and send me Elena's
medical records.

08:15.550 --> 08:17.190
- That is extremely illegal.

08:19.190 --> 08:21.960
Which makes it
that much more impressive.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.360
- Anyway, Elena's been
in and out of the ER

08:24.360 --> 08:28.530
this past year with multiple
injuries consistent with abuse,

08:28.530 --> 08:31.140
but she's never reported
anything to the police.

08:31.140 --> 08:34.840
- Says here Austin runs
an MMA gym in Brooklyn.

08:34.840 --> 08:37.510
- Want to take a ride?
- Mm-hmm.

08:41.850 --> 08:43.080
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me.

08:43.080 --> 08:44.580
We're looking
for Austin Reynolds.

08:44.580 --> 08:45.880
- Oh. In the octagon.

08:45.880 --> 08:47.890
- Thank you.

08:50.420 --> 08:53.090
- Whatever his career-ending
injury was,

08:53.090 --> 08:54.530
looks like it's all healed up.

09:01.330 --> 09:03.330
- Elena?

09:12.010 --> 09:14.180
- Ray, what are you doing here?

09:14.180 --> 09:16.420
- These are my friends,
Miles and Cara.

09:16.420 --> 09:20.290
- Sure, yeah.
I met Miles at the barbecue.

09:20.290 --> 09:21.320
What's going on?

09:21.320 --> 09:23.160
- Well, they're do-gooder
types. Uh--

09:23.160 --> 09:26.630
- Look, I saw your bruise
and you two arguing

09:26.630 --> 09:27.760
and I got concerned.

09:27.760 --> 09:29.230
- You thought
I was hitting her?

09:29.230 --> 09:30.430
- I'm sorry.

09:30.430 --> 09:32.400
I shouldn't have jumped
to conclusions.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.700
- It's fine, really.

09:33.700 --> 09:35.840
In addition to dating,
Austin's also my coach.

09:35.840 --> 09:37.510
We weren't arguing.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.270
He was getting on me about
not being late to my workout.

09:39.270 --> 09:41.580
- Well, now that
we have that settled,

09:41.580 --> 09:45.450
why didn't you tell me you were
some sort of octagon badass?

09:45.450 --> 09:47.450
- Sorry. Other than
my son Gabe and Austin,

09:47.450 --> 09:49.180
I don't really
talk about it much.

09:49.180 --> 09:50.620
I like to keep
my worlds separate.

09:50.620 --> 09:52.150
It's easier that way.

09:52.150 --> 09:53.790
- Well, it's gonna be close
to impossible to do that

09:53.790 --> 09:55.320
once she wins her next fight.

09:55.320 --> 09:56.620
- What do you mean?

09:56.620 --> 09:58.030
- Elena's been fighting
on the amateur circuit

09:58.030 --> 10:00.060
for about a year.
She's undefeated.

10:00.060 --> 10:01.460
Her next fight's in a week,

10:01.460 --> 10:03.330
and when she wins,
she can finally turn pro.

10:03.330 --> 10:06.500
- Not to mention
there's a $75,000 purse.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.700
- Wow.
Well, it sounds like everything

10:08.700 --> 10:10.170
is going great, then.

10:10.170 --> 10:13.370
- Other than needing
to work on my armbar, yeah.

10:14.480 --> 10:16.940
- Well, you know, social worker
turned MMA fighter

10:16.940 --> 10:18.950
is a pretty interesting story.
I'm a journalist.

10:18.950 --> 10:20.850
I'd love to sit down
and hear all about it.

10:20.850 --> 10:24.150
- Thanks, but I don't really
like to talk about myself much.

10:24.150 --> 10:25.390
- Hey, you might
as well get used to it.

10:25.390 --> 10:26.920
Once you take down
Killer Kate Sanchez,

10:26.920 --> 10:28.390
everybody's gonna want
an interview.

10:28.390 --> 10:30.120
- Look, we can chat
and then you can decide.

10:30.120 --> 10:31.430
And I can use as much

10:31.430 --> 10:32.960
or as little
as you feel comfortable with.

10:32.960 --> 10:35.300
- Okay. Stick around.

10:35.300 --> 10:36.560
- Mom.

10:36.560 --> 10:38.030
- Hey.

10:38.030 --> 10:39.530
You remember Ray, right, honey?

10:39.530 --> 10:41.500
- Yeah. Hey, Ray.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.300
How's Isaac doing?
Still a Jets fan?

10:43.300 --> 10:46.070
- Ugh.
Don't get me started, kid.

10:46.740 --> 10:48.880
- Mom, the Wi-Fi is down again.

10:48.880 --> 10:50.210
- You lost
video game privileges.

10:50.210 --> 10:52.580
Computer time
is for homework only.

10:52.580 --> 10:55.450
- When I lost video game
privileges as a kid,

10:55.450 --> 10:57.950
it was because
I got into trouble.

10:57.950 --> 11:01.490
- Mm. Gabe here got
detention twice last week.

11:01.490 --> 11:03.790
Somehow the kid
with perfect attendance

11:03.790 --> 11:05.330
has been cutting class,

11:05.330 --> 11:06.930
although he won't tell me why.

11:06.930 --> 11:09.000
- I promise.
I was doing my homework,

11:09.000 --> 11:11.200
but the Wi-Fi
is better at our house.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.500
Can't I just go home and do it?

11:12.500 --> 11:14.870
- Gabe,
I have to finish training.

11:14.870 --> 11:17.540
And you are not
walking home alone.

11:17.540 --> 11:18.740
- What, uh...

11:18.740 --> 11:20.840
what if Ray and I
took him home?

11:20.840 --> 11:23.810
- Yeah, why not?
We can stop for a slice, huh?

11:24.450 --> 11:25.650
- Mom?

11:26.110 --> 11:29.220
- Fine.
Straight home after pizza.

11:29.220 --> 11:30.750
Okay?

11:30.750 --> 11:32.420
Thank you.

11:35.260 --> 11:37.290
- No, that helps a lot.

11:37.290 --> 11:38.960
All right. I'll talk to you.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.230
- Isaac?
- No, actually.

11:40.230 --> 11:42.300
That was about your girl
Audrey Grenelle.

11:42.300 --> 11:43.760
- Really?
What did you find out?

11:43.760 --> 11:46.000
- Not much,
other than she's a criminal.

11:46.900 --> 11:47.940
She has 20 unpaid
parking tickets

11:47.940 --> 11:49.440
in the last year in New York.

11:49.440 --> 11:51.340
- Wait, wait, wait.
She has a car in the city?

11:51.340 --> 11:52.910
Then maybe she has a place.
Could you give me an address?

11:52.910 --> 11:54.910
- I'd have to go through
parking enforcement

11:54.910 --> 11:56.140
to get that.

11:56.140 --> 11:57.650
They tend to be a
tight-lipped group.

11:57.650 --> 12:00.080
But I do have a friend
that used to work at the DMV.

12:00.080 --> 12:01.650
I'll see if he can help.

12:01.650 --> 12:04.550
So any ideas as to why the God
Account sent us Elena's way?

12:04.550 --> 12:05.890
- Not sure.

12:05.890 --> 12:07.820
It could have something
to do with Gabe.

12:07.820 --> 12:10.260
Elena says she didn't know why
he was cutting class.

12:10.260 --> 12:12.160
- True, but she's always
talking about

12:12.160 --> 12:14.100
how smart
and responsible he is.

12:14.100 --> 12:15.430
- Yeah?
- And I've seen it.

12:15.430 --> 12:17.600
I mean, kid acts more like
an adult than me.

12:17.600 --> 12:20.800
- Well, that's called growing
up with a single parent.

12:20.800 --> 12:22.400
After my mom died,

12:22.400 --> 12:25.070
I suddenly became
aware of everything

12:25.070 --> 12:26.510
my dad had on his plate.

12:26.510 --> 12:28.240
At first, I tried to do
everything I could

12:28.240 --> 12:30.480
to either lighten the load
or avoid adding to it.

12:30.480 --> 12:32.280
Eventually,
I just stopped trying.

12:32.280 --> 12:34.780
But it's that awareness
that separates you

12:34.780 --> 12:39.120
from the other kids your age,
and Gabe seems very aware.

12:39.120 --> 12:40.420
- So whatever's going on,

12:40.420 --> 12:41.820
he doesn't want his mom
to know about it.

12:41.820 --> 12:43.090
- Mm-hmm.

12:43.090 --> 12:45.130
- Oh.
Thank you.

12:45.690 --> 12:47.030
Wow.

12:47.030 --> 12:49.630
Ho-ho!
Who's ready for a slice, huh?

12:49.630 --> 12:50.800
- Two, please.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.130
- Ooh. Must be good.

12:52.130 --> 12:53.530
- Best in Brooklyn.

12:53.530 --> 12:55.540
My mom and I used to come
here all the time.

12:55.540 --> 12:57.270
Every Sunday.

12:57.270 --> 12:59.570
We'd do pizza and just talk.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.680
- I take it you guys
haven't done that in a while.

13:01.680 --> 13:03.210
- Not for a while.

13:03.680 --> 13:06.410
- Look, I know your mom's busy,
but you still talk to her.

13:06.410 --> 13:08.180
- Yeah.
Whatever's going on in school,

13:08.180 --> 13:10.420
I'm pretty sure she still
wants to know about it.

13:10.420 --> 13:11.850
- It's no big deal.

13:14.790 --> 13:16.320
There's a bully at school.

13:16.320 --> 13:18.330
I've been getting detention
to avoid him.

13:18.330 --> 13:19.930
- Maybe your mom can help?
- No.

13:19.930 --> 13:21.560
I need to deal
with this on my own.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.700
She has enough to worry about.

13:23.700 --> 13:25.030
- What, with the fight?

13:25.030 --> 13:26.700
- No, it's not that.

13:26.700 --> 13:28.200
- Then what?

13:28.200 --> 13:30.240
- Nothing.
Can we take the pizza to go?

13:30.240 --> 13:33.210
I have to get home
and do my homework.

13:34.540 --> 13:35.610
- Yeah. Sure, kid.

13:44.220 --> 13:45.850
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, sweetheart.

13:45.850 --> 13:47.190
Trish, can I have a moment?

13:47.190 --> 13:48.620
I wanted to talk to you
about something.

13:48.620 --> 13:51.860
- Yes, but first,
I have some incredible news.

13:51.860 --> 13:53.330
- You do?

13:53.330 --> 13:55.400
- My friend Damien who works
at the botanical gardens

13:55.400 --> 13:56.630
just called.

13:56.630 --> 13:59.270
There has been a cancelation
and it is available.

13:59.270 --> 14:00.470
- Ah!

14:00.470 --> 14:02.900
- And we have always thought
it would be amazing

14:02.900 --> 14:04.510
to hold our reception there.

14:04.510 --> 14:07.040
So what do you think?
- I think it sounds perfect.

14:07.040 --> 14:09.610
- Oh, good!
- Yes!

14:09.610 --> 14:12.450
- Okay, look, Damien wants
to meet with us tomorrow.

14:12.450 --> 14:14.950
We need to jump on this
before someone else does.

14:14.950 --> 14:16.520
- This is so exciting.

14:16.520 --> 14:17.550
- Very.

14:19.050 --> 14:21.060
- So what did you
want to talk about?

14:21.060 --> 14:22.420
- You know what?
It can wait.

14:22.420 --> 14:24.560
This is really fantastic news.
- Yeah.

14:25.560 --> 14:26.890
- Look.

14:26.890 --> 14:28.630
- And this is the color
of the centerpieces

14:28.630 --> 14:29.830
I was wanting.

14:29.830 --> 14:32.030
Isn't that amazing?
- Yeah.

14:35.670 --> 14:37.200
- Thanks again for doing this.

14:37.200 --> 14:38.470
- Yeah. Austin's right.

14:38.470 --> 14:39.670
I mean, if I say
I'm ready to go pro,

14:39.670 --> 14:41.080
I have to act like one,

14:41.080 --> 14:42.640
and interviews come
with the territory.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.310
So what do you want to know?

14:44.310 --> 14:47.110
- Actually, I'm interested
in something you said earlier

14:47.110 --> 14:49.420
about keeping
your worlds separate.

14:49.420 --> 14:52.420
- Oh, I guess I'm just
a private person.

14:52.420 --> 14:54.690
You know, I didn't start
MMA for attention.

14:54.690 --> 14:56.220
- Then why did you?

15:04.830 --> 15:07.070
- I haven't really
told anyone about this

15:07.070 --> 15:09.470
other than Gabe and Austin,

15:09.470 --> 15:11.840
but...

15:11.840 --> 15:14.680
I was...

15:14.680 --> 15:17.240
Attacked and robbed

15:17.240 --> 15:20.480
two years ago
while coming home.

15:21.620 --> 15:23.920
- Elena, I'm so sorry.

15:23.920 --> 15:27.450
- After that night,
I felt so powerless.

15:27.450 --> 15:29.390
- Then you found MMA.

15:29.390 --> 15:32.460
- Yeah. I had to take control
of my life,

15:33.790 --> 15:36.130
and learning self-defense
helped me do that.

15:36.130 --> 15:39.100
But then eventually,
it became so much more.

15:40.900 --> 15:42.740
I started to feel just as good

15:42.740 --> 15:45.340
outside of the octagon
as I did inside.

15:45.340 --> 15:47.010
And...

15:47.010 --> 15:49.440
doesn't hurt that
I'm pretty damn good at it.

15:51.850 --> 15:53.080
Oh, sorry. One sec.

16:00.090 --> 16:02.290
- Is everything okay?

16:02.290 --> 16:03.320
- Yeah.

16:05.330 --> 16:07.090
- Come on.
Time to spar.

16:07.630 --> 16:09.460
- Can I stay and watch?

16:09.460 --> 16:11.730
- Absolutely.

16:11.730 --> 16:13.130
- Come on, Elena.

16:13.130 --> 16:14.840
Come on. Get in there.

16:14.840 --> 16:16.600
Jamie's not even close
to Elena's level,

16:16.600 --> 16:17.870
and she's dominating.

16:20.140 --> 16:22.940
Elena, focus!
Get your head on straight!

16:27.920 --> 16:29.080
Elena.

16:29.080 --> 16:31.750
- Elena.

16:31.750 --> 16:33.390
You okay?

16:34.050 --> 16:36.160
You okay?
You okay?

16:37.290 --> 16:38.590
- I'm fine.

16:38.590 --> 16:39.830
- You're not fine.
What the hell just happened?

16:39.830 --> 16:41.300
- Nothing.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.030
- Elena, that's not
the first time that one

16:43.030 --> 16:44.470
of your sparring partners
has taken you down lately.

16:44.470 --> 16:45.930
What's going on?

16:45.930 --> 16:47.000
- Nothing. I just lost
my focus for a second.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.400
I'm fine.
- Okay, look,

16:48.400 --> 16:50.200
this is the biggest
fight of your life.

16:50.200 --> 16:52.210
If you go into the octagon
the way you did just now,

16:52.210 --> 16:55.340
you will lose or worse.

16:55.340 --> 16:57.110
I'm just trying to protect you.

16:57.110 --> 16:58.950
- I don't need your protection.

16:58.950 --> 17:01.250
I'm going to win.

17:18.770 --> 17:20.640
- That's who Elena
has to fight?

17:20.640 --> 17:22.440
- Yeah,
and after what I saw today,

17:22.440 --> 17:24.040
I'm really worried for her.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.880
She got an email right before
she went in the ring.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.480
Whatever it was,
it really rattled her.

17:29.610 --> 17:31.080
Hey, Rakesh, could you--

17:31.080 --> 17:32.680
- Hack her email?
On it.

17:32.680 --> 17:35.020
- What is it?

17:35.020 --> 17:37.460
- My friend at the DMV struck
out at that Grenelle address.

17:37.460 --> 17:39.760
- What's he talking about?

17:39.760 --> 17:41.990
- Ray looked into Audrey
and found out

17:41.990 --> 17:44.830
that she has a bunch
of parking tickets,

17:44.830 --> 17:47.460
which made me think maybe she
has a place here in the city.

17:47.460 --> 17:48.970
- Unfortunately,
I don't have any connections

17:48.970 --> 17:50.530
with parking enforcement

17:50.530 --> 17:52.140
who can tell us where
the tickets were mailed to.

17:52.140 --> 17:55.810
Hey, can't you hack into that,
Mr. Extremely Illegal?

17:55.810 --> 17:58.540
- Actually, for once,
I don't think I have to.

17:58.540 --> 18:00.410
Um, when you guys
were in Paris,

18:00.410 --> 18:02.980
Joy's friend suggestion
was Sarah Matthews.

18:02.980 --> 18:05.080
She's a traffic
enforcement officer.

18:05.080 --> 18:06.950
I could see
if she could do us a favor.

18:06.950 --> 18:08.850
- That's great.

18:08.850 --> 18:11.890
Ray, what can you tell us about
the guy who attacked Elena?

18:11.890 --> 18:14.560
- I didn't even know
she was attacked until today.

18:14.560 --> 18:15.990
But I had a buddy
pull that file.

18:15.990 --> 18:17.360
Some crook named Leo James.

18:17.360 --> 18:20.460
He...

18:21.800 --> 18:24.600
Put her in the hospital
for three weeks.

18:24.600 --> 18:27.300
Now he's serving four years
for robbery

18:27.300 --> 18:28.570
and assault and battery.

18:28.570 --> 18:32.640
- Uh, actually he's not.

18:32.640 --> 18:34.850
That message Elena got

18:34.850 --> 18:36.850
was an email from
the Department of Corrections

18:36.850 --> 18:38.780
notifying her that
her petition to block

18:38.780 --> 18:41.420
his early release
has been denied.

18:41.420 --> 18:43.090
- Early release?

18:43.090 --> 18:46.120
Wait, the guy who attacked her
is getting out of jail?

18:46.120 --> 18:47.660
- Mm-hmm.
- When?

18:47.660 --> 18:49.060
- Today.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.230
- Ray.

18:57.230 --> 18:58.570
What are you guys doing here?

18:58.570 --> 18:59.900
- You got a minute?

18:59.900 --> 19:01.640
We need to talk.

19:02.570 --> 19:04.070
- Sorry to drop by so early.

19:04.070 --> 19:06.040
We wouldn't be here
if it wasn't important.

19:06.040 --> 19:07.480
- Hey, guys.
What's going on?

19:07.480 --> 19:08.950
- Hey, I'm glad you're here.

19:08.950 --> 19:10.380
We were hoping to speak
to the both of you.

19:10.380 --> 19:11.950
- About what?

19:11.950 --> 19:14.450
- We know about Leo James.

19:14.450 --> 19:18.090
That he got released
from prison yesterday.

19:18.090 --> 19:19.490
- That's none of your business.

19:19.490 --> 19:20.790
- You knew about this?

19:20.790 --> 19:23.360
- I just found out.
It's no big deal.

19:23.360 --> 19:24.600
It's in the past, babe.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.800
- We don't think it is.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.500
- Yesterday,
right after you got that email,

19:28.500 --> 19:30.230
you got knocked down
in the ring.

19:30.230 --> 19:31.770
Austin said it himself.

19:31.770 --> 19:33.800
If you get in that ring
and you're not 100% focused,

19:33.800 --> 19:36.270
you'll lose--or worse,
you'll get hurt.

19:36.270 --> 19:37.440
- So what are you saying?

19:37.440 --> 19:38.610
I shouldn't fight?

19:38.610 --> 19:39.980
Who the hell
do you think you are?

19:39.980 --> 19:41.410
- Elena, they're just
trying to help.

19:41.410 --> 19:42.550
- There's nothing
to worry about.

19:42.550 --> 19:44.350
- Tell that to Gabe.

19:45.320 --> 19:47.720
He is so worried about you

19:47.720 --> 19:48.990
that he's afraid to tell you

19:48.990 --> 19:50.650
that he's getting
bullied at school.

19:50.650 --> 19:54.220
- Do not talk
to me about my son.

19:54.220 --> 19:56.260
You don't know us.

19:56.260 --> 19:58.630
I am not
calling off this fight.

19:58.630 --> 20:00.430
I have sacrificed way too much

20:00.430 --> 20:02.400
and I have worked
way too hard to get here.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.170
- No one's saying
that you haven't.

20:04.170 --> 20:06.700
But at what cost?

20:06.700 --> 20:09.470
Elena, if you don't take
a step back from the ring,

20:09.470 --> 20:11.080
get help to deal
with Leo James,

20:11.080 --> 20:12.810
you could push your son away,

20:12.810 --> 20:16.950
and it will take years
to get that relationship back.

20:19.320 --> 20:22.790
- Look,
I have been distracted lately.

20:22.790 --> 20:25.860
I found out Leo James was gonna
be released two weeks ago,

20:25.860 --> 20:29.090
but I didn't know when
until I got that email.

20:29.090 --> 20:30.230
But I'm fine now.

20:30.230 --> 20:32.100
- Hold up.
Two weeks ago?

20:32.100 --> 20:34.700
That's when you got knocked out
in your sparring session.

20:34.700 --> 20:37.870
You were lucky you didn't
end up in the hospital.

20:37.870 --> 20:39.970
Elena,
maybe they're right, love.

20:39.970 --> 20:41.640
- No, they're not.

20:41.640 --> 20:44.310
And if I don't
get into that octagon,

20:44.310 --> 20:45.840
Leo James wins.

20:48.510 --> 20:51.150
There's no way
I'm gonna let that happen.

20:55.820 --> 20:57.390
- So from what you've told me,

20:57.390 --> 20:59.290
it sounds like Elena's dug in.

20:59.290 --> 21:00.490
- Yeah, she is.

21:00.490 --> 21:01.530
- I've worked
with a lot of patients

21:01.530 --> 21:02.960
who've been assaulted.

21:02.960 --> 21:04.730
And every single case
is different because

21:04.730 --> 21:06.660
everyone deals with emotional
trauma in their own way.

21:06.660 --> 21:08.770
- Yeah,
and clearly Elena has chosen

21:08.770 --> 21:11.170
to deal with her emotions
in the octagon.

21:11.170 --> 21:15.010
- But even if she wins,
it won't make things better.

21:15.010 --> 21:17.440
She'll keep burying her trauma,
and pretty soon

21:17.440 --> 21:19.410
it'll start affecting
other areas of her life.

21:19.410 --> 21:21.150
- It already has.

21:21.150 --> 21:25.320
Her relationship with her son
is suffering because of this.

21:26.880 --> 21:28.490
- Look...

21:28.490 --> 21:30.590
in terms of therapy,

21:30.590 --> 21:32.520
there are a lot
of great options out there.

21:32.520 --> 21:33.990
But from what I'm hearing,

21:33.990 --> 21:36.690
there's one in particular
I think might help Elena.

21:36.690 --> 21:38.500
It's called
restorative justice.

21:38.500 --> 21:39.930
- What's that?

21:39.930 --> 21:41.370
- It facilitates meetings
between the victims

21:41.370 --> 21:42.930
and their offenders.

21:42.930 --> 21:45.700
It allows both sides
to begin the healing process.

21:45.700 --> 21:47.040
- Well, that sounds perfect.
How do we set it up?

21:47.040 --> 21:49.340
- Well, both sides
need to agree to sit down.

21:49.340 --> 21:50.910
I'd start with Leo James first.

21:50.910 --> 21:53.580
Reach out to his PO,
find out if he's okay with it

21:53.580 --> 21:55.080
before bringing it to Elena.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.580
- Ray's an ex-cop.

21:56.580 --> 21:58.850
I bet he can help with that.
I'll give him a call.

21:58.850 --> 22:01.820
- Actually, do you think Cara
could handle this one?

22:02.420 --> 22:04.860
I'm meeting Dad and Trish
at the botanical gardens

22:04.860 --> 22:05.960
in half an hour.

22:05.960 --> 22:07.490
It's their dream venue.

22:07.490 --> 22:10.160
And I thought it could be
something we look at together

22:10.160 --> 22:11.500
as a family.

22:12.760 --> 22:13.860
- Yeah.

22:13.860 --> 22:16.500
I'll head down to my office,
call Ray,

22:16.500 --> 22:17.940
let you know
if I find anything.

22:17.940 --> 22:19.370
- Okay.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.570
- Okay. Great.
- Hey, um...

22:23.570 --> 22:25.640
before we go,

22:25.640 --> 22:29.750
there's something
I need to tell you about Dad.

22:35.020 --> 22:38.220
- I take it you're passing
on my offer to work together.

22:38.220 --> 22:40.190
- I'm considering
all my options.

22:40.190 --> 22:42.260
- You have a real
competitive side, don't you?

22:42.260 --> 22:45.460
- Mm, says the guy who bet me
his office last week?

22:45.460 --> 22:47.060
- Well...

22:47.060 --> 22:50.070
- Fancy place you got here.

22:50.070 --> 22:52.240
- Ray, how did you
get past reception?

22:52.240 --> 22:54.170
I'm excellent at small talk.

22:54.170 --> 22:55.340
Who's this?

22:55.340 --> 22:58.140
- Um, Adam Gray,
Ray Nicolette.

22:58.140 --> 22:59.280
- Nice to meet you.

22:59.280 --> 23:00.780
- Ray is an ex-cop turned P.I.

23:00.780 --> 23:03.380
He's helping me on my story.

23:03.380 --> 23:04.650
- Good luck.

23:04.650 --> 23:06.820
Let me know
if you change your mind.

23:06.820 --> 23:07.850
- I won't.

23:09.820 --> 23:11.960
- Seems like a nice kid.

23:11.960 --> 23:13.390
- Or not?

23:13.390 --> 23:15.530
- He thinks my stories
are too repetitive,

23:15.530 --> 23:17.460
that I should shake things up.

23:17.460 --> 23:18.900
- I take it you disagree.

23:18.900 --> 23:20.960
- Well, let's let
the leaderboard decide.

23:20.960 --> 23:22.000
- Attagirl.

23:25.340 --> 23:29.540
- So any luck reaching out
to Leo James's parole officer?

23:29.540 --> 23:31.580
- As a matter of fact, yes.

23:31.580 --> 23:34.480
Said he was gonna talk to Leo
about sitting down with Elena.

23:34.480 --> 23:36.010
- Does he think
he'd be open to it?

23:36.010 --> 23:37.250
- Possibly.

23:37.250 --> 23:38.550
He said Leo was
a first-time offender.

23:38.550 --> 23:41.190
That's a good sign.

23:41.190 --> 23:42.620
What's with the look?

23:42.620 --> 23:45.060
- I don't know.
I can't put my finger on it,

23:45.060 --> 23:47.020
but I feel like
we're missing something.

23:47.020 --> 23:48.890
- I'm listening.

23:48.890 --> 23:50.630
- Elena was attacked
two years ago.

23:50.630 --> 23:53.400
So why did the God Account
send us her name now?

23:53.400 --> 23:54.930
- Easy. Leo James.

23:54.930 --> 23:58.700
- Right, but she could've
sat down with Leo anytime.

23:58.700 --> 24:00.500
Yet we get her name a week

24:00.500 --> 24:02.270
before the biggest fight
of her life?

24:02.270 --> 24:04.140
- So you still think
she shouldn't fight?

24:04.140 --> 24:05.510
- Honestly, I don't know.

24:05.510 --> 24:07.210
Part of me wants her
to get in that octagon

24:07.210 --> 24:08.480
and watch her win.

24:08.480 --> 24:09.950
She deserves that.

24:09.950 --> 24:11.780
I mean, she's been
in and out of the hospital

24:11.780 --> 24:13.450
a bunch of times
this past year,

24:13.450 --> 24:14.890
and yet she keeps
getting back in the ring.

24:14.890 --> 24:16.120
I admire her for it.

24:16.120 --> 24:19.820
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
The hospital. That's it.

24:19.820 --> 24:21.490
Do you have that
medical report I gave you?

24:21.490 --> 24:23.290
- Yeah. Yeah.

24:26.100 --> 24:27.500
Why?

24:29.970 --> 24:32.970
- Austin said Elena got
knocked out two weeks ago,

24:32.970 --> 24:34.640
that she was lucky
not to have ended up

24:34.640 --> 24:36.270
in the hospital, right?

24:36.270 --> 24:37.640
But look.

24:37.640 --> 24:40.310
According to her
medical records, she did.

24:40.310 --> 24:41.950
- That's what
we've been missing.

24:41.950 --> 24:44.210
Elena hasn't been distracted
the last two weeks.

24:44.210 --> 24:46.120
She's been hurt.

24:46.120 --> 24:47.420
- So it's right over this way.

24:47.420 --> 24:49.690
- This is so beautiful.

24:49.690 --> 24:52.060
Ali, thank you
so much for this.

24:52.060 --> 24:53.620
- Of course.

24:53.620 --> 24:56.760
- So I take it
you haven't told her yet?

24:57.930 --> 25:00.760
- We're having lunch after
this, and then I'm going to.

25:00.760 --> 25:02.100
- Okay.

25:02.100 --> 25:04.500
- So the tables would be
set up around the fountain,

25:04.500 --> 25:07.440
and the dance floor
will be right over there.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.340
What do we think?

25:09.340 --> 25:11.110
- I think
it's absolutely perfect.

25:11.110 --> 25:12.210
- Yeah.

25:12.210 --> 25:13.740
- We'll take it.
- Yes!

25:13.740 --> 25:15.680
- Great.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.710
Now I know the window's tight,
but I promise you,

25:17.710 --> 25:20.180
two weeks from Sunday,
we'll be ready.

25:20.180 --> 25:22.520
- Wait a minute, Damien.
Two weeks?

25:22.520 --> 25:24.960
You said the cancelation
was for the 31st.

25:26.220 --> 25:29.330
- I must have mixed up
the dates.

25:29.960 --> 25:31.960
Is there any chance you could
bump up your timeline?

25:31.960 --> 25:33.660
- Not possible.

25:33.660 --> 25:38.600
- We--uh, Arthur,
let's just talk about this.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.340
- Why don't I give you
a minute?

25:41.440 --> 25:44.640
- Look, I know--
I know that this is fast,

25:44.640 --> 25:47.580
but we can pull this together.

25:47.580 --> 25:50.850
I mean, we are not
gonna get a place like this.

25:50.850 --> 25:53.250
I mean, there's no reason
to pass it up.

25:54.220 --> 25:55.750
- Yes, there is.

25:57.390 --> 26:02.330
I can't get married
in two weeks because...

26:02.330 --> 26:04.530
that's when
the Diocese of New York

26:04.530 --> 26:07.300
swears in the next bishop.

26:07.300 --> 26:09.900
And they offered it to me.

26:09.900 --> 26:11.570
And I accepted.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.940
- Arthur, how could you not
tell me this?

26:13.940 --> 26:17.070
- I wanted to yest--look...

26:17.070 --> 26:18.310
we can discuss it now.

26:18.310 --> 26:20.480
- What exactly
is there to discuss?

26:20.480 --> 26:21.810
That they offered
you the position

26:21.810 --> 26:24.680
or that you decided
to accept it?

26:24.680 --> 26:25.880
- Right.

26:27.750 --> 26:28.790
Sorry.

26:30.790 --> 26:33.360
I know this wasn't
part of the plan,

26:33.360 --> 26:35.290
but you know how important
this is to me.

26:35.290 --> 26:37.560
You stood by me
when I ran for bishop.

26:37.560 --> 26:40.430
- Yes. But when you lost,

26:40.430 --> 26:42.430
you told me that
this was the time

26:42.430 --> 26:44.940
for a new chapter
in your life.

26:44.940 --> 26:46.870
And then you asked me
to marry you.

26:46.870 --> 26:49.470
- I still want to marry you.
That hasn't changed.

26:49.470 --> 26:52.640
- But things have changed,
Arthur.

26:52.640 --> 26:54.640
We bought a home together.

26:57.210 --> 27:01.180
I sold a business that I loved.

27:01.180 --> 27:03.890
I made sacrifices
for you and I,

27:03.890 --> 27:09.260
and I--I--I thought that
you were gonna do the same.

27:09.260 --> 27:12.230
But clearly...

27:12.230 --> 27:13.560
I was wrong.

27:17.830 --> 27:19.570
- What are you saying?

27:20.940 --> 27:22.710
- I can't do this.

27:24.370 --> 27:26.440
I'm sorry, Arthur.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.210
I can't marry you.
- Trish.

27:30.210 --> 27:31.420
Trish.

27:45.800 --> 27:48.040
- Dad, are you okay?

27:51.110 --> 27:53.170
- She just needs more time.

27:54.540 --> 27:56.980
- I'm gonna go see
if she's okay.

28:03.990 --> 28:06.620
- Dad, what are you gonna do?

28:08.360 --> 28:10.160
- Talk to her.

28:10.160 --> 28:11.330
Make her understand.

28:11.330 --> 28:12.930
- No, I think she understands.

28:12.930 --> 28:14.260
- What do you mean?

28:14.260 --> 28:17.370
- She knows that
if you become bishop...

28:17.370 --> 28:19.770
she's gonna lose you
to the church.

28:19.770 --> 28:22.340
- I can find that balance,
Miles.

28:24.340 --> 28:25.670
This is what
I've always wanted.

28:25.670 --> 28:26.910
This is my calling.

28:26.910 --> 28:29.980
I cannot turn down
this second chance.

28:29.980 --> 28:33.150
- You want to talk
about second chances?

28:33.150 --> 28:34.720
You found
the love of your life

28:34.720 --> 28:37.090
not once, but twice,

28:37.090 --> 28:38.390
and you're willing to risk that

28:38.390 --> 28:41.020
just so you can
become the bishop?

28:52.070 --> 28:54.800
Sorry, Dad. I...

28:54.800 --> 28:56.140
I gotta go.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.520
- Elena went to the hospital
two weeks ago

29:10.520 --> 29:12.550
and was diagnosed
with a detached retina.

29:12.550 --> 29:14.260
- Well,

29:14.260 --> 29:15.860
I'm guessing two weeks isn't
enough time for that to heal.

29:15.860 --> 29:17.160
- I spoke with Jaya,

29:17.160 --> 29:18.590
and she said
more like two months.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.430
I mean, Elena hasn't been
getting knocked down

29:20.430 --> 29:22.030
during practice because
she's been getting distracted.

29:22.030 --> 29:23.330
It's her vision.

29:23.330 --> 29:25.030
- Which is why she kept it
from Austin.

29:25.030 --> 29:27.700
She knows he would stop
her from fighting.

29:27.700 --> 29:30.270
- Yeah, come on.

29:30.270 --> 29:32.270
Yeah.

29:33.040 --> 29:35.140
- Yeah.

29:35.140 --> 29:37.380
- I don't want them here.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.220
- I need you guys to leave.

29:42.220 --> 29:44.290
- No. We can't do that.

29:44.290 --> 29:46.050
- Look,
we know Leo James being free

29:46.050 --> 29:48.060
isn't why you've been
getting knocked down.

29:48.060 --> 29:49.060
- What's she talking about?

29:49.060 --> 29:50.220
- I have no idea.

29:50.220 --> 29:51.430
- That's not true, Elena.

29:51.430 --> 29:52.560
- I said go!

29:53.900 --> 29:55.700
- Mom.

29:55.700 --> 29:57.100
Is everything okay?

29:57.100 --> 29:59.300
- Everything's fine.
Go do your homework.

29:59.300 --> 30:01.800
- No, it's not fine, Elena.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.100
Two weeks ago,

30:03.100 --> 30:05.570
you were diagnosed
with a detached retina.

30:06.470 --> 30:08.480
- How could you possibly
know that?

30:08.480 --> 30:10.280
Did you pull
my medical records?

30:10.280 --> 30:12.450
- Hold up, is that true?
- No.

30:12.450 --> 30:13.680
Of course not.

30:13.680 --> 30:14.920
- She's lying.

30:15.650 --> 30:16.950
- Gabe.

30:16.950 --> 30:18.650
- Mom, you could barely see
the next day.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.860
You don't think I know
what's going on with you,

30:20.860 --> 30:22.390
but I do.

30:22.390 --> 30:24.630
- There is nothing wrong
with my vision, okay?

30:24.630 --> 30:26.490
- Then why did you
keep it a secret?

30:26.490 --> 30:28.600
- It's not a secret.

30:28.600 --> 30:31.070
And I didn't tell you
because I am fine.

30:31.070 --> 30:32.300
- No.

30:32.300 --> 30:33.730
You're not fighting.
End of story.

30:33.730 --> 30:34.870
- What? No, you can't do that.

30:34.870 --> 30:36.470
- Yes, I can.

30:36.470 --> 30:38.910
I'm not gonna be responsible
for you losing your eyesight

30:38.910 --> 30:40.740
or worse.
I love you too much.

30:40.740 --> 30:43.810
I have to tell the medical
commission about your injury.

30:51.920 --> 30:54.860
- I know you think
you were trying to help,

30:54.860 --> 30:56.760
but you just let
Leo James win.

30:56.760 --> 30:58.060
- No, we didn't.

30:58.060 --> 30:59.760
Every time
you get into that ring,

30:59.760 --> 31:01.430
you see Leo James.

31:01.430 --> 31:03.300
That's not where
you need to face him.

31:03.300 --> 31:05.330
That's not how
you're gonna get over this.

31:05.330 --> 31:07.470
- What are you talking about?

31:07.470 --> 31:10.740
- There's a program called
restorative justice.

31:10.740 --> 31:12.310
- Yeah, I know what it is.

31:12.310 --> 31:14.110
You want me
to sit down with Leo James

31:14.110 --> 31:16.440
so he can tell me he's sorry?

31:16.440 --> 31:18.250
Like that'll make
everything okay?

31:18.250 --> 31:21.450
- We know how it sounds,
but this could be a first step.

31:21.450 --> 31:22.950
- I've reached out to his PO.

31:22.950 --> 31:25.690
He says Leo James
is open to the idea.

31:25.690 --> 31:28.890
He's staying at Harmony Home.
It's a 20-minute cab ride.

31:38.470 --> 31:39.500
- You're right.

31:40.700 --> 31:44.240
The only way I'm gonna
get over this is to face him.

31:53.950 --> 31:56.650
- Tried calling Trish, but...

31:56.650 --> 31:57.750
she won't answer.

31:57.750 --> 32:00.220
Did you ever speak with her?

32:00.220 --> 32:01.390
- I did.

32:01.390 --> 32:03.460
- And?
What'd she say?

32:03.460 --> 32:04.690
- Not much.

32:04.690 --> 32:08.000
I tried to tell her that
you guys could work it out

32:08.000 --> 32:10.030
or at least talk it over.

32:10.030 --> 32:13.270
But she didn't think
there was anything left to say.

32:15.540 --> 32:17.610
- I can't...

32:17.610 --> 32:18.770
lose her.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.310
- Then fight for her.

32:20.310 --> 32:21.580
- How?

32:21.580 --> 32:24.150
Everyone thinks that
the moment I become bishop,

32:24.150 --> 32:25.450
they'll lose me to the church,

32:25.450 --> 32:27.110
that I won't be able
to find balance--

32:27.110 --> 32:30.620
not Trish, not your brother.

32:33.750 --> 32:34.990
I don't know.

32:36.160 --> 32:37.390
Maybe they're right.

32:39.930 --> 32:42.360
- You're the only one
that can answer that.

32:46.730 --> 32:49.970
But when it comes to the people
that you love,

32:49.970 --> 32:52.070
I know you can change.

32:52.070 --> 32:54.210
I've seen it.

32:54.210 --> 32:56.880
And I believe in you.

33:05.820 --> 33:08.420
- So Elena agreed
to participate

33:08.420 --> 33:10.560
in the restorative
justice program

33:10.560 --> 33:11.960
and face Leo James.

33:11.960 --> 33:13.490
- Miles, that's great.

33:13.490 --> 33:15.630
- Hopefully, she can finally
take a step forward

33:15.630 --> 33:17.300
for her and Gabe.

33:17.300 --> 33:19.200
- Speaking of taking
a step forward,

33:19.200 --> 33:21.270
I texted Sarah Matthews
the parking ticket number

33:21.270 --> 33:22.470
of one Audrey Grenelle.

33:22.470 --> 33:23.500
- And?

33:23.500 --> 33:25.240
- She hasn't responded
to my text yet.

33:25.240 --> 33:27.040
She's a bit of a rule-follower,

33:27.040 --> 33:28.710
so I might've oversold
her willingness to help,

33:28.710 --> 33:33.410
but, you know, keep the faith,
or whatever it is you keep.

33:38.420 --> 33:40.020
Wait, she's got a key,
too, now?

33:40.020 --> 33:41.520
- Yeah. So?

33:41.520 --> 33:44.590
- Miles,
I thought we were key buddies.

33:45.930 --> 33:49.130
-  So how's your new
story about Elena going?

33:49.130 --> 33:51.000
You see the leaderboard
in your future?

33:51.000 --> 33:52.700
- Actually, yeah, I do.

33:56.540 --> 33:57.570
- Hey, Ray.

33:58.810 --> 34:00.040
What's up?

34:02.510 --> 34:04.010
Are you sure?

34:04.010 --> 34:07.050
Yeah, we'll--
we'll meet you there.

34:08.950 --> 34:11.590
Leo James changed his mind.

34:12.850 --> 34:14.290
- You've gotta be kidding me.

34:14.290 --> 34:15.560
I mean,
after everything he did,

34:15.560 --> 34:17.220
he won't even
sit down with her?

34:17.220 --> 34:19.260
- Well, maybe we can talk to
him, you know?

34:19.260 --> 34:20.860
Maybe re-change his mind.

34:20.860 --> 34:22.560
- Yeah, yeah,
it's worth a shot.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.270
Ray said that
he was staying at some

34:24.270 --> 34:25.930
halfway house in the Bronx.

34:25.930 --> 34:27.400
Can you see
if he can get a location?

34:27.400 --> 34:28.800
And Ray's gonna
meet us at Elena's

34:28.800 --> 34:29.900
so we can tell her together.

34:32.740 --> 34:33.940
- Guys?

34:33.940 --> 34:35.510
Come on in.

34:35.510 --> 34:37.810
- Hey, is Elena here?
We need to talk.

34:37.810 --> 34:39.880
- No, she's not.
What's going on?

34:39.880 --> 34:42.320
- Leo James changed his mind.

34:42.320 --> 34:44.850
He's not going
to sit down with Elena.

34:44.850 --> 34:46.090
- What?

34:47.150 --> 34:49.360
No. No, he can't do that.

34:49.360 --> 34:52.460
You guys said this was the way
my mom could finally move on.

34:52.460 --> 34:53.530
- We know.

34:53.530 --> 34:55.660
- Yeah,
and we're gonna keep trying.

34:55.660 --> 34:57.100
- Wait, Gabe.

34:58.170 --> 34:59.630
I don't understand.

34:59.630 --> 35:01.140
Elena said that
she was gonna meet you guys

35:01.140 --> 35:02.640
at the parole office
this morning.

35:02.640 --> 35:03.900
Where is she?

35:03.900 --> 35:05.240
- Uh, I think you
got that mixed up.

35:05.240 --> 35:06.510
We didn't have
any plans to meet her.

35:06.510 --> 35:08.140
- Yeah, what exactly
did she say

35:08.140 --> 35:09.640
when she left the house
this morning?

35:09.640 --> 35:11.080
- That she was finally
gonna face him,

35:11.080 --> 35:12.580
put all of this behind her.

35:14.420 --> 35:18.090
- Maybe she is, but not
in the way that were hoping.

35:18.650 --> 35:20.620
I don't think Elena
ever had any intention

35:20.620 --> 35:22.920
of facing Leo James
through restorative justice.

35:22.920 --> 35:24.430
- She's going after him.

35:24.430 --> 35:25.830
- We gotta find her.

35:25.830 --> 35:27.630
- Elena, Gabe, and I
share our cell phone locations.

35:27.630 --> 35:28.900
I can see where she's at.

35:28.900 --> 35:30.360
- I'll try to get
ahold of Leo's PO,

35:30.360 --> 35:32.130
see if he can call him in
before she finds him.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.930
- It says she's at a park
somewhere in the Bronx.

35:33.930 --> 35:35.100
Maybe we're wrong about this.

35:35.100 --> 35:36.800
- No. No, we're not.

35:36.800 --> 35:40.210
The halfway house that Leo
is staying at is in the Bronx.

35:40.210 --> 35:42.640
We have to stop her
before she gets there.

35:47.690 --> 35:48.890
- Ray's trying
to contact Leo's PO,

35:48.890 --> 35:50.320
but he hasn't heard back.

35:50.320 --> 35:51.720
- Yeah, well, let's just hope
Elena is still here.

35:53.690 --> 35:55.360
Hey. Rakesh, what's up?

35:55.360 --> 35:57.260
- I was able to get the address
of Leo's halfway house,

35:57.260 --> 35:59.200
but it looks like we weren't
the only ones looking for it.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.630
- Wait,
what are you talking about?

36:00.630 --> 36:02.430
- Long story short,
Elena Googled the address

36:02.430 --> 36:04.670
of Harmony Home from her laptop
a little while ago,

36:04.670 --> 36:07.940
and it is two blocks away from
that park you're headed to.

36:07.940 --> 36:09.110
- Wait, Miles.

36:09.110 --> 36:11.810
Look. It's Elena.

36:12.940 --> 36:15.510
- Hey, Rakesh,
I'll call you back.

36:15.510 --> 36:17.520
Elena.

36:18.850 --> 36:20.350
- What are you doing here?

36:20.350 --> 36:22.020
- You said you needed
to face Leo James,

36:22.020 --> 36:24.490
but sitting down with him
wasn't what you meant.

36:24.490 --> 36:26.830
You meant taking things
into your own hands.

36:26.830 --> 36:28.730
- Your version
of confronting the man

36:28.730 --> 36:30.400
that attacked me is a joke.

36:30.400 --> 36:34.670
- Elena, what is fighting him
going to prove?

36:34.670 --> 36:35.970
What happens then?

36:35.970 --> 36:37.570
You go to jail.
Gabe goes to foster care.

36:37.570 --> 36:40.040
- Leo James
doesn't get to apologize.

36:40.040 --> 36:43.140
That is not justice--
not the kind that I need.

36:43.140 --> 36:44.910
I've been to that
halfway house before,

36:44.910 --> 36:47.610
so, yes,
I came here to face him,

36:47.610 --> 36:48.810
and that's what
I'm going to do.

36:48.810 --> 36:50.320
- Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

36:50.320 --> 36:53.220
If you've been there,
why did you Google the address?

36:53.220 --> 36:55.250
- What are you talking about?
I didn't.

36:58.120 --> 37:00.490
- Does Gabe have access
to your laptop?

37:00.490 --> 37:01.630
- Yeah. Why?

37:01.630 --> 37:03.190
- Oh, no.
- What?

37:03.190 --> 37:04.900
- We stopped by your apartment
earlier to tell you

37:04.900 --> 37:06.430
that Leo James
changed his mind,

37:06.430 --> 37:08.000
but you weren't there.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.470
- When he heard the news,
he took it really hard.

37:09.470 --> 37:10.670
He stormed off.

37:10.670 --> 37:12.000
- You think Gabe is on his way

37:12.000 --> 37:13.140
to Leo James's halfway house?

37:13.140 --> 37:15.870
- Yeah, and we need to go--
now.

37:25.250 --> 37:26.620
- Gabe!

37:26.620 --> 37:27.850
Stop. You can't do this.

37:27.850 --> 37:29.150
- I can.

37:29.150 --> 37:30.520
I need to get him
to talk to you.

37:30.520 --> 37:31.790
- I don't want to talk to him,
okay?

37:31.790 --> 37:33.960
I just want to go home.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.890
Okay?
- No. No.

37:35.890 --> 37:37.230
You have to do this.

37:37.230 --> 37:39.260
It's the only way
you'll get better.

37:39.260 --> 37:40.430
- I'm fine.

37:40.430 --> 37:42.870
- No, you're not.

37:43.770 --> 37:46.470
Please, I want my mom back.

37:52.080 --> 37:54.150
- I want her back too.

37:57.180 --> 38:01.650
I thought
that by becoming a fighter,

38:01.650 --> 38:04.460
I wouldn't be afraid anymore.

38:04.460 --> 38:06.390
But the truth is...

38:06.390 --> 38:08.530
I am still scared.

38:08.530 --> 38:11.200
And I have been
so consumed by my fear

38:11.200 --> 38:14.970
that I have been...
Neglecting the one person

38:14.970 --> 38:18.200
that means more to me
than anything else.

38:19.300 --> 38:25.310
And I am never
going to do that again.

38:25.310 --> 38:26.980
I promise.

38:34.620 --> 38:36.050
I love you.

38:44.600 --> 38:46.800
Thank you.

39:01.180 --> 39:03.480
- Thank you for meeting me.

39:10.860 --> 39:13.890
I'm sorry
for what happened yesterday.

39:13.890 --> 39:16.090
- So am I.

39:21.670 --> 39:22.930
- I have a lot to prove to you.

39:22.930 --> 39:24.370
You're worried I can't balance

39:24.370 --> 39:28.310
being the bishop and a husband,
but I can.

39:28.310 --> 39:31.310
- Arthur, that--
- I can find that balance.

39:31.310 --> 39:33.710
Trish, please.

39:33.710 --> 39:34.950
Marry me.

39:40.720 --> 39:44.090
- I'm heading up
to my farm upstate.

39:44.090 --> 39:45.690
I need to get away.

39:45.690 --> 39:48.990
I need some time to think.

39:48.990 --> 39:51.300
- Trish,
I don't want to lose you.

39:51.300 --> 39:53.700
I love you.

39:53.700 --> 39:55.570
- I love you too.

39:57.940 --> 40:00.970
But sometimes...

40:00.970 --> 40:02.540
that's not enough.

40:15.690 --> 40:18.290
- Sometimes we can see
our lives

40:18.290 --> 40:20.830
echoed in those around us.

40:20.830 --> 40:24.130
It gives us a renewed
sense of purpose,

40:24.130 --> 40:26.800
reminds us
of what's important

40:26.800 --> 40:30.400
and what we're really
fighting to hold on to.

40:30.400 --> 40:31.870
- I missed this, Mom.

40:31.870 --> 40:33.740
- Me too.

40:33.740 --> 40:37.340
- ♪ Change is gonna come ♪

40:37.340 --> 40:39.880
- Why don't you tell me about
what's going on in school?

40:39.880 --> 40:42.250
- ♪ Change is gonna come ♪

40:42.250 --> 40:45.880
- But sometimes,
no matter how hard we try,

40:45.880 --> 40:47.390
it isn't enough.

40:47.390 --> 40:48.550
- I can't believe it.

40:48.550 --> 40:50.720
My story didn't even
end up on the leaderboard.

40:50.720 --> 40:53.760
- Maybe it's time
to reconsider Adam's offer?

40:57.460 --> 40:58.660
- Maybe I should.

40:58.660 --> 41:00.870
- ♪ Change is gonna come ♪

41:00.870 --> 41:05.700
- It can leave us torn between
the past and the future.

41:05.700 --> 41:07.970
- ♪ Change is gonna come ♪

41:13.640 --> 41:14.980
- In the end,

41:14.980 --> 41:16.910
our actions
will always be stronger

41:16.910 --> 41:18.180
than our words,

41:18.180 --> 41:20.920
but I believe
people can change,

41:20.920 --> 41:22.520
that we can learn
from our mistakes,

41:22.520 --> 41:26.860
and that our future
remains unwritten.

41:33.260 --> 41:35.230
Hey, guys.
You ready to go get some food?

41:35.230 --> 41:38.970
- Um, actually, we've got
something better to do.

41:38.970 --> 41:41.210
- Heard back
from Sarah Matthews.

41:41.210 --> 41:44.010
She got us an address
for Audrey Grenelle.

41:44.010 --> 41:45.640
It's in Brooklyn.

41:54.690 --> 41:56.020
- Think it's under Grenelle?

41:56.020 --> 41:57.990
- Uh, her name isn't listed.

41:57.990 --> 41:59.290
Are you sure this
is the right address?

41:59.290 --> 42:00.320
- Mm-hmm.

42:08.130 --> 42:12.140
- Wait, didn't Ray say she had,
like, 20 parking tickets?

42:16.740 --> 42:18.080
- Hi. Excuse me.

42:18.080 --> 42:20.410
Are you Audrey Grenelle?

42:20.410 --> 42:23.080
- Yes. That's me.

42:23.080 --> 42:24.950
- Um, my name is Miles Finer.

42:24.950 --> 42:27.120
This is Cara and Rakesh.

42:27.120 --> 42:29.190
We just wanted to ask you
a few questions

42:29.190 --> 42:30.560
about one of your paintings

42:30.560 --> 42:32.420
at the Future of Art exhibit
in Paris.

42:32.420 --> 42:34.130
- Oh, if you want to speak
to me about that,

42:34.130 --> 42:36.090
you need to go through
my gallery in the city.

42:36.090 --> 42:38.900
- It's about "The Path."

42:38.900 --> 42:40.260
Did you know
there was a message

42:40.260 --> 42:41.800
hidden in the painting?

42:41.800 --> 42:44.840
- How could you possibly
know about that?

42:44.840 --> 42:46.800
- Because it was meant for me.

42:57.720 --> 42:59.450
- Stay tuned for scenes from
our next episode.

43:20.340 --> 43:21.780
- Greg, move your head.
