09:51.895 --> 09:52.896
Surprise!What?

09:52.940 --> 09:53.941
Oh, my God!

09:53.984 --> 09:55.377
What are you doing here?

09:55.420 --> 09:56.552
You brought me Froyo?

09:56.596 --> 09:58.467
That's my favorite "yo."

09:59.424 --> 10:01.601
All your favorite toppings.
We got gummy bear.[phone vibrating]

10:01.644 --> 10:03.167
We got cookie dough.TIA:
Hey, Jen.

10:03.211 --> 10:04.778
Your phone's buzzing.Oh. Okay.

10:04.821 --> 10:06.954
I'll be right back.
Don't cut anyone's hair.

10:08.303 --> 10:09.826
Hey, Sam, when
Mom gets back,

10:09.870 --> 10:11.480
tell me that story you
told me in the car.

10:11.523 --> 10:13.700
I'll pretend I've
never heard it.Got it.

10:13.743 --> 10:15.136
Sorry.

10:15.179 --> 10:16.616
Sam was just gonna tell me

10:16.659 --> 10:18.226
something that happened
in class today.

10:18.269 --> 10:19.967
Okay.Based on his excitement,
it may top the day

10:20.010 --> 10:22.273
his health teacher threw up
in the CPR dummy's mouth.

10:23.231 --> 10:25.886
Yes! A Sam story
straight from the source. Go.

10:25.929 --> 10:27.757
So, Miss Hong was asking
for volunteers...

10:27.801 --> 10:29.280
Jen? I'm here.

10:29.324 --> 10:31.761
Hey! Brenda.
Uh, why don't you have a seat

10:31.805 --> 10:33.241
and get settled,
and I'll be right over.

10:33.284 --> 10:34.808
Okay.

10:34.851 --> 10:36.897
Continue.Honey, is-is
this a bad time?

10:36.940 --> 10:38.072
[phone vibrating]Yes, but I don't want you to go.

10:38.115 --> 10:39.943
Jen, your phone's buzzing again.

10:39.987 --> 10:42.598
Honey, it's fine.I'm in a little bit
of a time crunch.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.904
Do you want me to get it?No.

10:43.947 --> 10:45.601
No, no, no. Uh, no, I got it.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.082
I'm sorry, guys. I got to go.

10:48.125 --> 10:50.258
But I love
that you came by. Here.

10:50.301 --> 10:51.346
Feel free

10:51.389 --> 10:53.740
to eat my yo if it's still fro.

10:53.783 --> 10:55.524
[chuckles]

10:56.481 --> 10:58.179
[exhales]

11:01.704 --> 11:03.271
How much would you give me

11:03.314 --> 11:05.012
for this 1965 rookie card?

11:05.055 --> 11:06.840
Keeping in mind
he's a Hall of Famer

11:06.883 --> 11:09.973
and only three people have
ever touched this card.

11:10.017 --> 11:11.671
Four.

11:12.976 --> 11:16.458
Actually, sorry. Hold it
gently, loosely by the edges.

11:16.501 --> 11:17.677
Like that.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.504
No, looselier.

11:19.548 --> 11:20.810
Looselier. I'm...

11:22.333 --> 11:23.987
You know what, I'm actually
gonna hold on to this one.

11:26.337 --> 11:28.339
And this one.

11:29.340 --> 11:31.212
Also this one.

11:31.255 --> 11:32.953
Wow.

11:32.996 --> 11:34.781
This was a huge
waste of your time.

11:34.824 --> 11:37.609
All right.
Hardwood Hustle it is.

11:37.653 --> 11:40.525
Great. We're gonna
take those fools down.

11:41.483 --> 11:44.704
That'll teach them to sell a guy
hair pills that don't work.

11:51.319 --> 11:53.147
Sizes?11.

11:53.190 --> 11:54.278
Nine.

11:54.322 --> 11:56.585
So, I called the old lady back.

11:56.628 --> 11:59.196
You sold her
a second reverse mortgage?Damn right.

11:59.240 --> 12:01.895
Plus a warranty to her car,
and I don't even do those.

12:01.938 --> 12:03.723
[both laugh]

12:05.072 --> 12:07.030
All right, gentlemen. Have fun.

12:07.074 --> 12:08.728
Ah.

12:08.771 --> 12:11.382
Mm-hmm. While you still alive,

12:11.426 --> 12:14.646
'cause you gonna be
smoking turds in hell.[chuckles]

12:15.647 --> 12:17.911
Um, Sam,

12:17.954 --> 12:20.087
here's five bucks, pal.
Um, go play video games, okay?

12:20.130 --> 12:21.262
Nice.

12:23.873 --> 12:25.440
All right. I'm going in.

12:25.483 --> 12:27.181
All right, so,
how we gonna play these chumps?

12:27.224 --> 12:28.791
Rock the Baby?
Skin the Goat?

12:28.835 --> 12:30.837
Oh, Karaoke
Night in Taiwan?

12:32.664 --> 12:35.319
Does this look like Taiwan,
dummy?

12:36.973 --> 12:38.845
We're doing
a classic Hardwood Hustle,

12:38.888 --> 12:40.455
same as when Tom was a kid.

12:40.498 --> 12:42.718
You throw the first game.
You ask for another chance.

12:42.762 --> 12:46.113
You double the bet,
and then ba-ba-bam.

12:47.070 --> 12:48.768
Okay.

12:48.811 --> 12:50.595
I'm going in. Do I
look like a sucker?

12:50.639 --> 12:51.814
[chuckles]:
You always look like a sucker.

12:52.859 --> 12:54.904
You have cheese in your beard.

13:00.127 --> 13:01.563
Howdy, fellas.

13:01.606 --> 13:03.217
Hope I don't disturb you
if I play over here.

13:03.260 --> 13:04.827
It's been a few years
since I bowled.

13:04.871 --> 13:08.918
Boy, that lane sure is long.

13:10.441 --> 13:13.923
Ugh. That act was a lot cuter
when he was 11.

13:15.272 --> 13:18.145
All right, Cinderella.

13:18.188 --> 13:20.582
I'm off to the ball.

13:20.625 --> 13:24.064
Okay, earrings or no earrings?

13:24.107 --> 13:25.456
In that skirt, I don't think

13:25.500 --> 13:26.631
anyone's gonna notice
you have ears.

13:28.198 --> 13:30.244
Okay. Have fun. Be safe.

13:30.287 --> 13:32.072
Do not settle
for a guy with a futon.

13:32.115 --> 13:35.118
You deserve a bed
that's never a couch.

13:36.119 --> 13:37.512
Thanks, Mom.

13:37.555 --> 13:39.253
Mm.

13:39.296 --> 13:41.255
Least I can be a mom
to someone today.

13:41.298 --> 13:42.996
What are you talking about?

13:43.039 --> 13:44.693
You were a great mom
all day today.

13:44.736 --> 13:46.521
How? I wasn't home.

13:46.564 --> 13:48.958
I-I couldn't even take
a Froyo break with them.

13:49.002 --> 13:51.265
That's right. Because
you were working your ass off

13:51.308 --> 13:52.657
and showing Sam
you'll do anything

13:52.701 --> 13:53.920
to provide for your family

13:53.963 --> 13:55.660
while your husband
chases his dream.

13:55.704 --> 13:57.488
Yeah?Hell yeah.

13:57.532 --> 14:01.014
I would take that badass mom
over robot Jessica Alba any day.

14:02.972 --> 14:05.322
Do you ever notice
that her eyes don't move?

14:05.366 --> 14:06.758
It's like...

14:09.936 --> 14:11.807
Thanks.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.635
[chuckles]

14:13.678 --> 14:15.898
You know, I got to stop
feeling sorry for myself

14:15.942 --> 14:18.074
and-and be in acceptance.

14:18.118 --> 14:20.642
Like, this is my new life now,
and we're gonna be okay.

14:20.685 --> 14:23.079
And I just need
to start focusing

14:23.123 --> 14:24.646
on all the...Ooh. I got to go.

14:24.689 --> 14:26.430
I think my gummy just kicked in.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.657
Well,

14:35.700 --> 14:37.180
here goes nothing.

14:37.224 --> 14:39.313
How many pins do I need
to catch up to you guys?

14:39.356 --> 14:41.315
36.And you have ten left.

14:41.358 --> 14:42.751
Ooh! Wow.

14:42.794 --> 14:45.493
[grunts]
That seems impossible.

14:47.190 --> 14:48.844
You only lose when
you don't try.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.325
That's very deep, Brad.I'm Ben.

14:51.368 --> 14:53.066
There you go
being deep again, Brad.

14:55.633 --> 14:57.853
Now comes the ba-bam.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.073
I really feel like I
started to hit my groove

15:00.116 --> 15:01.161
towards the end there.

15:01.204 --> 15:02.989
Guess it just wasn't your day.

15:03.032 --> 15:04.599
I-I'm open to
playing again.

15:04.642 --> 15:06.340
I'd even be willing
to double the bet.

15:06.383 --> 15:07.558
What do... What do you say?

15:08.559 --> 15:09.909
I'm good.

15:12.563 --> 15:13.738
What?

15:13.782 --> 15:15.262
I sell reverse mortgages.

15:15.305 --> 15:16.828
Do you really think
you're gonna hustle me?

15:16.872 --> 15:18.569
[Brad and Ben laughing]

15:25.925 --> 15:27.665
What the hell
just happened?

15:27.709 --> 15:30.755
I think you just got
Karaoke'd in Taiwan.

15:32.105 --> 15:35.238
Or, as they say...
[speaks Chinese]

15:37.980 --> 15:40.113
"The teacher has
been taught."

15:41.636 --> 15:43.594
What? I'm taking
night classes.

15:43.638 --> 15:44.987
Let me grow.

15:50.036 --> 15:51.341
Hey.TOM:
Hey.

15:51.385 --> 15:54.475
Um, can I talk to you
for a second?

15:54.518 --> 15:56.607
I-I know you're tired.

15:58.044 --> 16:00.698
Not that you look tired.
You look great.[chuckles]

16:00.742 --> 16:02.744
Fresh.
Like the day I met you.

16:02.787 --> 16:04.137
Okay. Honey.

16:05.094 --> 16:06.704
Radiant?

16:08.054 --> 16:09.403
I... Look, I just...

16:09.446 --> 16:10.708
I know it's
a tough time right now,

16:10.752 --> 16:12.188
and the burden's
all on you.

16:12.232 --> 16:15.148
So I-I wanted to do something
to give you a break.

16:18.847 --> 16:20.196
Ba-bam.

16:21.154 --> 16:23.025
[laughs]

16:23.069 --> 16:25.506
But where did
this come from?I had an interesting day.

16:25.549 --> 16:26.986
I won a couple hundred bucks
off a guy

16:27.029 --> 16:28.857
doing the Hardwood Hustle.

16:28.900 --> 16:31.381
It didn't go well at first.
I actually lost money.

16:31.425 --> 16:32.948
Okay.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.515
But then I found
this other guy.

16:34.558 --> 16:36.952
[laughs]
Guess I just got lucky.

16:36.996 --> 16:40.303
You say the 7-10 split
is difficult to pick up?

16:45.308 --> 16:48.137
So you conned a guy
out of his money?

16:48.181 --> 16:49.704
I'm a smooth operator.

16:49.747 --> 16:51.619
[chuckles]

16:51.662 --> 16:54.056
And it worked perfectly
until...

16:54.100 --> 16:56.189
[mouths]

17:04.632 --> 17:06.677
I couldn't do it.

17:06.721 --> 17:08.331
I'm a dad now.

17:08.375 --> 17:10.812
That doesn't set
a good example for Sam.

17:10.855 --> 17:13.293
So I gave the money back.

17:13.336 --> 17:15.338
So where did this
money come from?

17:16.339 --> 17:18.472
I sold
my baseball card collection.

17:18.515 --> 17:21.605
What? Babe, come on.
You love that collection.

17:22.606 --> 17:24.347
I love you more.

17:24.391 --> 17:26.088
It was a no-brainer.

17:26.132 --> 17:27.785
[sighs]

17:27.829 --> 17:29.831
Give them a good home.

17:29.874 --> 17:31.137
Actually, maybe...

17:31.180 --> 17:32.834
Maybe I could
just say goodbye.

17:32.877 --> 17:35.793
Just a little... Just
five more minutes, maybe?

17:37.360 --> 17:40.059
I'm having a bit of
seller's remorse.

17:41.277 --> 17:43.410
Is this money gonna

17:43.453 --> 17:45.455
solve all of our problems? No.

17:45.499 --> 17:48.328
Can you quit your job? Nope.

17:48.371 --> 17:49.894
[chuckles]

17:49.938 --> 17:51.766
Not even close.

17:53.115 --> 17:54.464
But can you take
a couple of days off?

17:54.508 --> 17:55.944
You're damn right.

17:55.987 --> 17:57.902
And the first day,
you get to chaperone

17:57.946 --> 18:00.253
Sam and his tap dance troupe
to the mall,

18:00.296 --> 18:02.255
and you'll get to tell me
all about it.

18:02.298 --> 18:05.867
The day after that, get to spend
the afternoon at the spa

18:05.910 --> 18:07.782
for some much deserved
relaxation and pampering.

18:07.825 --> 18:09.131
Followed by

18:09.175 --> 18:12.047
pizza and wings.
Maybe even that dessert.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.005
You can tell it's just
pizza dough with sugar on it,

18:14.049 --> 18:15.442
but it's still pretty good.

18:17.139 --> 18:20.447
I don't know. It-it depends
on how much cash we have left.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.102
Is that not good?

18:24.755 --> 18:26.453
It's better than good.

18:27.323 --> 18:30.239
You're always better than good.

18:30.283 --> 18:32.111
All those years,

18:32.154 --> 18:34.765
you worked a job you didn't love
to keep a roof over our head.

18:34.809 --> 18:36.332
You missed

18:36.376 --> 18:38.813
so many things with Sam,
and you never said a word.

18:38.856 --> 18:40.249
You never made me
feel bad about it.

18:40.293 --> 18:42.643
Now it's my turn.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.124
I love you.

18:45.167 --> 18:47.082
I love you, too.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.823
[chuckles]

18:52.435 --> 18:54.089
[chuckles]

18:54.133 --> 18:56.744
We make a pretty good team.Mm-hmm.

18:56.787 --> 19:00.139
Not as good as the '84 Tigers,
which I had. Near mint.[groans]

19:04.143 --> 19:06.014
With counseling,
I'll-I'll get over it.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.937
Okay.

19:15.980 --> 19:18.940
Girl products smell different
from boy products.

19:18.983 --> 19:21.508
Boy products are all
tobacco and leather.

19:21.551 --> 19:23.945
It smells like a leprechaun
baby shower in here.

19:23.988 --> 19:25.381
[laughs]

19:26.382 --> 19:28.471
Cute, right?

19:28.515 --> 19:31.213
[exhales]
You are helping me close

19:31.257 --> 19:32.432
to spend time together.

19:32.475 --> 19:34.477
Anything you say is cute.

19:35.304 --> 19:36.871
[chuckles]

19:36.914 --> 19:39.613
[both laugh]

19:40.614 --> 19:42.572
Oops. Sorry.
[chuckles]

19:42.616 --> 19:43.878
You guys can have
this room.

19:43.921 --> 19:45.532
We'll just take
the chair by the sink.
