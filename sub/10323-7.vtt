00:08.142 --> 00:12.113
o [ Earl Narrating ]
For me, prison was like a long
car vacation with my parents--

00:12.180 --> 00:14.182
the more I slept,
the shorter the trip.

00:14.248 --> 00:16.217
Wakey, wakey.
Hands off penis.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.453
It's for protection.

00:19.520 --> 00:23.757
There's a new guy here who
thinks it's funny to pull on
your junk while you're sleeping.

00:23.824 --> 00:25.693
The principal
wants to see you.

00:25.759 --> 00:30.131
You mean the warden?
Yeah. Did I say
landlord again?

00:30.198 --> 00:32.266
No.
Good.

00:33.801 --> 00:36.737
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Yeah, Hickey.
Come on in.

00:36.804 --> 00:41.275
You don't mind
if I multitask, do you?
Not at all, sir.

00:41.342 --> 00:44.978
Vinnie's here
to shave some guy
for the electric chair.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.381
Oh, I hate
execution days.

00:47.448 --> 00:50.584
Especially if they die with
a funny look on their face,
and you start giggling.

00:50.651 --> 00:53.587
Then suddenly you're
the jerk who's laughing
at an execution.

00:53.654 --> 00:56.457
Anyway,
I am getting ready...

00:56.524 --> 00:58.959
to start a program
called "Scared Straight."

00:59.026 --> 01:01.129
Not into the ladies, huh?

01:01.195 --> 01:04.132
Well, it worked for a guy
at my parents' church.

01:04.198 --> 01:06.334
No, no. The program
I'm talkin' about...

01:06.400 --> 01:10.171
is where we go into schools,
and we try to scare kids
out of a life of crime.

01:10.238 --> 01:12.973
We used to bring 'em here.

01:13.040 --> 01:15.143
Didn't work out too well.

01:17.145 --> 01:20.548
Remember, be scared,
stay straight.

01:20.614 --> 01:23.184
Excuse me.

01:23.251 --> 01:25.619
He wasn't my buddy
when we came in.

01:29.490 --> 01:32.326
We finally found
the real kid
in the washing machine.

01:32.393 --> 01:36.029
Two months later,
he's still dizzy.
[ Chuckles ]

01:36.096 --> 01:41.335
So, what do you say?
Are you in?

01:41.402 --> 01:45.005
I'll give you a certificate
that knocks another five weeks
off your prison sentence.

01:45.072 --> 01:47.141
If it keeps 'em
out of trouble...

01:47.208 --> 01:49.543
and gets me out of here
five weeks sooner,

01:49.610 --> 01:51.645
I guess scaring kids
is a good thing.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.781
Great! All right,
you're gonna be
putting on...

01:53.847 --> 01:55.883
a presentation at the school
in a couple of days.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.886
Just pick
any three prisoners
you want to help you.

01:58.952 --> 02:02.390
Just, if you pick a black guy,
make sure he's a doctor
or lawyer.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.325
We don't want to perpetuate
negative stereotypes.

02:06.194 --> 02:08.629
My name is Earl.

02:12.400 --> 02:15.669
[ Earl Narrating ]
I was excited to get started
on my Scared Straight project,

02:15.736 --> 02:18.138
but first I had to look
after Randy.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.442
You okay, Randy?
I'm great.

02:21.509 --> 02:25.313
Found a shady spot in the yard
where no other guards could
see me, and I took a nap.

02:25.379 --> 02:29.049
[ Earl Narrating ]
Because as great as it was
to see Randy every day--

02:29.116 --> 02:31.018
well, he wasn't the best
prison guard.

02:31.084 --> 02:33.887
It was great.
How was your weekend?

02:37.958 --> 02:40.761
[ Earl Narrating ]
Sometimes I got there
in the nick of time.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.634
Hey, Randy.
Hey, Earl.

02:46.700 --> 02:50.404
[ Earl Narrating ]
And sometimes I didn't.
Mealtime.

02:50.471 --> 02:52.773
Hello! Dinner.
[ Man ]
* I was in the right place *

02:54.141 --> 02:56.244
* Must have been
the wrong time *
Oh! Oh, no!

02:56.310 --> 02:58.279
[ Giggling ]
That tickles.

02:58.346 --> 03:01.549
[ Gasps ]
No. No, no.
No, no! No!

03:01.615 --> 03:03.951
No! Earl! Earl! No! Earl!

03:04.017 --> 03:06.520

03:09.923 --> 03:11.859
- * My head is in a bad place *
- [ Sniffs ]

03:11.925 --> 03:13.961
* But I'm havin'
such a good time *
Yeah.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.830
[ Earl Narrating ]
And sometimes he wasn't
just a danger to himself.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.732
Everyone, this is Fred.

03:18.799 --> 03:21.635
It's his first time
in prison, and he's
a little nervous.

03:21.702 --> 03:24.672
He used to be a police
officer, and then he
molested a little boy.

03:24.738 --> 03:27.575
So make him feel welcome.
* Must have been
the right time *

03:27.641 --> 03:29.910
* I been in the right place **

03:29.977 --> 03:32.179
Really? They wrote
"Best guard"
on my forehead?

03:32.246 --> 03:34.147
They sure did.

03:34.214 --> 03:37.050
[ Earl Narrating ]
I realized if I wanted
to keep Randy out of trouble,

03:37.117 --> 03:40.688
I needed to keep him close,
and I figured the warden
wouldn't mind.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.623
Good news, Randy.

03:42.690 --> 03:44.692
The warden thinks
you should be the guard...

03:44.758 --> 03:47.461
to escort us on
the Scared Straight project.
Cool!

03:47.528 --> 03:49.497
I was worried he thought
I was an idiot...

03:49.563 --> 03:51.665
when he saw me fall
out of that guard tower.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.302
I guess when I said,
"I meant to do that,"
he believed me.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.904
[ Earl Narrating ]
I was trying to help Randy
stay out of trouble,

03:56.970 --> 03:59.707
and a very pregnant Joy
was trying to get
out of bed.

04:01.409 --> 04:04.111
Oh, thank God you're here.
I'm stuck again.

04:04.177 --> 04:07.114
This mattress is
pressing against me
like a creepy uncle.

04:07.180 --> 04:09.450
[ Earl Narrating ]
Recently, Joy had found out
that Liberty,

04:09.517 --> 04:13.421
her lifelong enemy,
was also her lifelong
half-sister.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.323
And after putting aside
their differences,

04:15.389 --> 04:18.158
Joy agreed to be Liberty
and Ray-Ray's surrogate mom.

04:18.225 --> 04:21.795
Baby, I told you you needed
to stay in the middle.
I was in the middle.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.931
That damn monster truck
pulled in next door...

04:23.997 --> 04:26.233
and created a wave
that pushed me
into the crack.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.469
Just get me out of here.
I'm gonna go sleep
on the couch.

04:28.536 --> 04:32.606
Now, you know you're not allowed
to sleep on any furniture
with exposed rusty springs.

04:32.673 --> 04:35.576
We don't know it was the couch
that gave Earl Junior lockjaw.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.678
Besides, when I agreed
to be their surrogate,

04:37.745 --> 04:40.047
I didn't realize they were
part of the Nazi gazpacho.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.149
[ Earl Narrating ]
Being new to parenting,
Liberty and Ray-Ray...

04:42.215 --> 04:44.117
had a lot of baby rules.

04:44.184 --> 04:46.754
No fried foods, no trans fat,
no alcohol, no tobacco--

04:46.820 --> 04:50.023
You first timers
are way overprotective.
I was that way with Dodge.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.926
I even switched
to Marlboro Lights, and he
still came out with asthma.

04:52.993 --> 04:56.196
With Earl Junior,
she smoked cloves.
That's why he likes spicy food.

04:56.263 --> 05:00.000
Also, no soft cheeses,
no canned cheeses,

05:00.067 --> 05:03.671
no antiperspirants,
no hair dye
and no g-strings.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.773
No g-strings
or canned cheese?

05:05.839 --> 05:09.142
How the hell am I supposed
to celebrate New Year's?

05:09.209 --> 05:11.779
[ Earl Narrating ]
And even though she agreed
to all those demands,

05:11.845 --> 05:16.183
nine months and two weeks later,
her patience was runnin' thin.

05:16.249 --> 05:17.751
[ Groans ]

05:17.818 --> 05:21.121
Even though Joy was not in
a very good place, Randy was--

05:21.188 --> 05:24.692
by my side,
where he'd be safe while I had
my Scared Straight auditions.

05:24.758 --> 05:27.194
Our first two auditioners
are Frank and Paco.

05:27.260 --> 05:29.096
Frank's new to performing,

05:29.162 --> 05:31.865
but Paco did once
stab a guy in front
of a big crowd.

05:31.932 --> 05:36.303
Thanks for comin' in.
Frank, why don't you go first?
Scare me straight.

05:36.370 --> 05:38.305
Okay. All right.
Yo, yo!

05:38.372 --> 05:41.542
When you get in here,
first I'm gonna mess you up,
and then--

05:43.544 --> 05:45.979
I'm sorry.
I blanked out.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.148
[ Stammering ]
You know, I had it perfectly
back in my cell.

05:48.215 --> 05:50.851
You know what? My fault.
Paco should have gone first.

05:50.918 --> 05:52.986

and collect yourself.

05:54.788 --> 05:57.825
- Go for it, Paco.
- It's not too bad in here.

05:57.891 --> 06:01.228
I mean, I made some
new friends, and I even
took a computer course.

06:01.294 --> 06:04.064
And last week
I googled myself-- Paco--

06:04.131 --> 06:08.802
and I found out I have
unclaimed money in Tejas--
that's Texas for you.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.938

06:11.004 --> 06:13.306

You like to cuddle?
You're in.

06:16.444 --> 06:19.112
Did you really think
this could possibly work?

06:19.179 --> 06:21.014
I gave it a shot.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.383
This is you.

06:23.451 --> 06:25.986
This is you in prison.

06:28.956 --> 06:33.160
Any questions?
It was confusing,
but I like your voice.

06:33.226 --> 06:36.597
- You're in.
- Watch this.
This'll freak the kids out.

06:41.769 --> 06:44.371
That was impressive, Wilson.

Wilson?

06:48.008 --> 06:50.310
Damn, I wish he would have
saved that for the show.

06:50.377 --> 06:52.345

all your teeth,

06:52.412 --> 06:54.281
and rent you out
for cigarettes like what.

06:54.347 --> 06:57.184
When I get a hundred cigarettes,
I'm gonna stuff 'em all
up in your mouth...

and make you smoke 'em,

'Cause prison is boring.

I had my Scared Straight team
together...

07:09.930 --> 07:12.032
and was excited
to show the warden.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.536
Okay, kids.

07:15.603 --> 07:20.808
The scariest thing about prison
is that there's violence
everywhere.

Everywhere. Yeah.
Everyone's always trying
to get over on you.

07:25.378 --> 07:27.648
And when you think you're safe,

[ Whispering ]
you're walking along
by yourself...

07:30.918 --> 07:32.853

had a green message too?

- Green-- It means
"environmentally friendly."

you had to do it

take the shower killing story,
