05:33.208 --> 05:35.181
Who is it?

06:13.248 --> 06:14.999
What'd you have to kill him for?

06:15.000 --> 06:16.893
Shut up.

06:30.390 --> 06:33.142
Now that the school year's
coming to a close,

06:33.143 --> 06:38.199
many of you will be going forth to prove
how cleverly you can run the world.

06:39.232 --> 06:43.378
More power to you as you take
your turn in the barrel.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.614
Some of you will continue
with your education.

06:46.615 --> 06:50.294
Some of you, I hope, will continue
with your interest in art.

06:54.873 --> 06:59.519
Some of you will have other
interests, other talents.

07:00.962 --> 07:03.130
If we've learned
nothing else this year,

07:03.131 --> 07:05.382
I hope you've learned the
stupidity of the statement

07:05.383 --> 07:08.260
that art belongs to the world.

07:08.261 --> 07:12.014
'Cause art belongs to the
cultured who can appreciate it.

07:12.015 --> 07:15.768
The majority of the great unwashed
does not fit into this category.

07:15.769 --> 07:19.824
And neither, I'm sorry
to say, do most of you.

07:43.755 --> 07:45.172
Dr. Hemlock.

07:45.173 --> 07:48.968
I just wanted to tell you how much
I really enjoyed your course.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.845
I've never felt this
close to art before.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.013
How nice.

07:53.014 --> 07:55.432
But I have a problem.

07:55.433 --> 07:56.725
How terrible.

07:56.726 --> 08:00.437
Well, you see, if I don't keep my B
average, I'm gonna lose my scholarship,

08:00.438 --> 08:03.992
and I really don't think I'm gonna
do so well in your final exam.

08:04.150 --> 08:07.027
I mean, I've gained a whole
new feeling about art,

08:07.028 --> 08:10.878
but sometimes you can't always put
your true feelings down on paper.

08:11.366 --> 08:12.491
How true.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.160
If there was anything I could
do to get a better grade...

08:15.161 --> 08:17.634
I mean, I'd be willing
to do anything.

08:18.915 --> 08:21.217
Anything at all. Really.

08:23.461 --> 08:25.763
Do you realize the
implications of that offer?

08:29.551 --> 08:31.194
Are you busy this evening?

08:31.553 --> 08:32.945
No.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.972
You live alone?

08:34.972 --> 08:37.400
Oh, well, my roommate's
gone for the week.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.155
Good.

08:40.395 --> 08:41.854
Then,

08:41.855 --> 08:43.532
go on home,

08:44.399 --> 08:47.498
break out the books and
study your little ass off.

08:48.278 --> 08:51.457
That's the best way
to maintain a B average.

08:54.784 --> 08:58.429
Oh, uh... Don't study it all off.

09:09.966 --> 09:12.564
Why didn't you boff
the little quiff?

09:13.261 --> 09:15.637
'Cause I don't pick on
students or drunks.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.485
Get your feet off my desk.

09:18.933 --> 09:21.406
Mr. Dragon wants to see you.

09:22.103 --> 09:25.748
I'm sorry, Pope, but working for
you people no longer amuses me.

09:26.274 --> 09:29.919
C-2 isn't too interested
in what amuses you, pal.

09:31.362 --> 09:35.365
That's odd, being as your organization
has spent so much time and effort

09:35.366 --> 09:37.785
in trying to give the
rest of the world a laugh.

09:37.786 --> 09:40.134
You can remind Dragon
that I'm retired.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.544
You still here?

09:47.545 --> 09:50.923
Now really, you don't expect
me to just walk out that door,

09:50.924 --> 09:52.976
do you, sweetheart?

09:53.802 --> 09:57.846
Either through the door or through
the window. It's your choice.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.444
Now look, pal...

10:00.517 --> 10:02.434
Get your feet off my desk!

10:02.435 --> 10:03.727
Now look here, buddy...

10:03.728 --> 10:06.622
Don't call me "buddy,"
"pal," or "sweetheart."

10:10.318 --> 10:13.417
If I wasn't under orders,
I would...

10:17.617 --> 10:19.326
My superior wants to see you.

10:19.327 --> 10:22.454
Your superior? Well, that doesn't
narrow the field much, does it?

10:22.455 --> 10:26.250
Mr. Dragon wants to see you,
and right away, pal.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.461
I told you not to call me "pal."

10:29.462 --> 10:30.838
Mr. Dragon's not gonna like this.

10:30.839 --> 10:33.006
How long have you worked
for Dragon, Pope?

10:33.007 --> 10:34.174
Twelve years. Why?

10:34.175 --> 10:36.343
Then he's used to
having grief in his life.

10:36.344 --> 10:40.194
You can tell him I'm retired. C-2's
gonna have to live without me.

10:44.686 --> 10:46.937
Don't forget your trench coat.

10:46.938 --> 10:50.833
How's anybody gonna recognize
you without your disguise?

11:30.857 --> 11:32.204
Yes, Dragon.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.871
Ah, Hemlock!

12:16.527 --> 12:17.945
I knew you'd show up.

12:17.946 --> 12:20.322
It's just your charm, Pope.
I couldn't resist.

12:20.323 --> 12:22.199
Hold it.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.753
Empty your pockets, right there.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.377
No wallet?

12:33.378 --> 12:36.129
Well, I knew I'd be seeing you. I
thought I'd best leave it home.

12:38.132 --> 12:42.010
Miss Cerberus, you're
looking inviting today.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.471
I expected you before this.

12:44.472 --> 12:47.150
Mr. Dragon does not like
to be kept waiting.

12:47.642 --> 12:49.615
Oh, the impatient albino!

12:49.852 --> 12:51.812
I don't think
Mr. Dragon's affliction

12:51.813 --> 12:53.105
is a joking matter.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.941
I thought it was
rather humorous, myself.

12:55.942 --> 12:59.653
A spy network being run by a bloodless
freak who can't stand light or cold.

12:59.654 --> 13:02.447
Or germs! Are you healthy?

13:02.448 --> 13:04.283
Shall I turn my head and cough?

13:04.284 --> 13:06.451
No known infections?

13:06.452 --> 13:09.830
Nothing other than the usual.
Syphilis, running sores, and clap.

13:09.831 --> 13:13.385
All right, go in.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.203
Come in, Hemlock.

13:32.687 --> 13:37.163
A little to the left, Hemlock.
I'll turn on a light.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.654
Thanks. Could you spare it?

13:42.655 --> 13:45.003
You know, I'm something
of a distinction.

13:45.575 --> 13:47.534
A total albino.

13:47.535 --> 13:52.205
Even the slightest direct
light causes me intense pain.

13:52.206 --> 13:55.751
Does your physical disability preclude
you from coming to the point?

13:55.752 --> 13:59.921
All right. If you wish
no small talk, sit down.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.224
We'll discuss business.

14:06.095 --> 14:11.367
One of our agents has been
killed in Zurich by two men.

14:12.226 --> 14:14.949
We want you to sanction them.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.731
I'm sorry, you're gonna have
to get somebody else

14:17.732 --> 14:18.815
to do your wet work.

14:18.816 --> 14:22.444
Please, that is
a distasteful phrase.

14:22.445 --> 14:23.737
Call it what you want,

14:23.738 --> 14:25.906
"wet work," "termination,"
"sanction."

14:25.907 --> 14:28.617
It all adds up to
the same thing, killing.

14:28.618 --> 14:31.216
It is what you do best.

14:32.246 --> 14:33.622
You don't seem to remember, Dragon,

14:33.623 --> 14:34.915
I'm a retired assassin.

14:34.916 --> 14:37.125
The operative word
there is "retired."

14:37.126 --> 14:39.554
You'll have to get somebody
else to do your sanctions.

14:40.380 --> 14:45.106
I understand a new Pissarro has
come onto the black market.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.514
I'll just have to live without it.

14:50.515 --> 14:54.490
Your fascination with paintings
has always amazed me.

14:55.103 --> 14:57.326
You have how many now?

14:58.398 --> 15:00.575
- Twenty-one.
- Marvelous!

15:00.900 --> 15:04.194
I should think your collection
would be interesting material

15:04.195 --> 15:07.531
for the Internal Revenue people.

15:07.532 --> 15:12.536
How does an underpaid
professor buy rare paintings?

15:12.537 --> 15:15.465
Masterpieces worth millions?

15:15.873 --> 15:20.961
A professor with a
balance of $2,137

15:20.962 --> 15:23.588
in his checking account?

15:23.589 --> 15:25.983
You forgot the 42 cents.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.385
I wonder what the
tax people would say

15:28.386 --> 15:30.595
if I told them how I
made the money,

15:30.596 --> 15:32.305
by killing people
for the government.

15:32.306 --> 15:36.309
True. True. But, of course,
no one will believe you.

15:36.310 --> 15:41.116
And even more important, it won't
do anything for your paintings.

15:41.649 --> 15:44.568
What do you think
would happen to them?

15:44.569 --> 15:48.155
I imagine they'd be seized

15:48.156 --> 15:52.677
and auctioned off, made
available to everyone.

15:53.202 --> 15:56.830
Perhaps Mr. Pope
would be able to buy one.

15:56.831 --> 16:00.750
Won't it do your heart good to think
of one of your precious paintings

16:00.751 --> 16:02.928
in Mr. Pope's hands?

16:04.172 --> 16:07.549
Dragon, you have a talent for
describing the indescribable.

16:07.550 --> 16:10.260
There are two assailants.

16:10.261 --> 16:12.596
Our search division has located

16:12.597 --> 16:15.491
only one of these men in Zurich.

16:15.933 --> 16:18.435
C-2 is working on the second one,

16:18.436 --> 16:21.021
and I would hope that they
will have identified him

16:21.022 --> 16:24.166
by the time you arrive in Zurich.

16:24.775 --> 16:27.903
We have reason to believe
that the Zurich man

16:27.904 --> 16:32.365
is responsible for the assassination
of several of our agents

16:32.366 --> 16:34.885
in a most savage manner.

16:37.205 --> 16:39.623
I'll take one sanction. Only one.

16:39.624 --> 16:41.875
All right.

16:41.876 --> 16:45.420
We shall talk about the second
sanction when the time comes.

16:45.421 --> 16:47.714
The price'll be $20,000.

16:47.715 --> 16:50.926
Twice your usual fee? Absurd!

16:50.927 --> 16:54.857
You want the sanction
performed, you pay $20,000.

16:56.057 --> 16:58.517
You are without conscience.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.227
How true.

17:00.228 --> 17:02.187
Which brings me to
another small fee

17:02.188 --> 17:04.105
I want to get for this job.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.066
Which is?

17:06.067 --> 17:08.859
I'd like a statement from
the Internal Revenue Service

17:08.861 --> 17:11.488
listing my collection of paintings.

17:11.489 --> 17:14.991
I'd like it to say that the IRS
has examined my collection,

17:14.992 --> 17:19.663
and that the IRS is fully aware of the
circumstances under which I obtained them,

17:19.664 --> 17:23.594
and that my ownership is legal
and without tax liability.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.920
You drive a hard bargain.

17:26.921 --> 17:30.395
You want somebody sanctioned.
I want a piece of paper.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.393
All right.

17:33.177 --> 17:36.697
You'll have the IRS
statement this evening.

17:37.348 --> 17:41.152
Here is the cash.

17:51.362 --> 17:52.612
$20,000.

17:52.613 --> 17:54.256
$20,000!

17:55.324 --> 17:57.534
I hate being predictable.

17:57.535 --> 17:59.963
You are never that, Hemlock.

18:51.255 --> 18:52.505
Who is there?

18:52.506 --> 18:53.632
A delivery.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.884
I have this box of
dental floss for Dr. Millard,

18:55.885 --> 18:58.358
but he doesn't answer his door.

19:01.182 --> 19:02.474
He's off today.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.225
What'll I do
with this box of floss?

19:04.226 --> 19:07.075
I don't give a shit
what you do with it, buddy.

19:07.521 --> 19:10.040
Well, you don't have to be
violent about it.

19:11.734 --> 19:13.526
Get lost, cupcake.

21:55.773 --> 21:57.370
Look out!

22:49.827 --> 22:51.879
Crap?

22:52.913 --> 22:54.965
I beg your pardon?

22:55.916 --> 22:57.625
You did start this conversation

22:57.626 --> 22:59.419
by saying "crap," didn't you?

22:59.420 --> 23:02.269
No, I didn't say it. I asked it.

23:03.966 --> 23:07.176
Is this today's alternative
to, "Coffee, tea, or milk?"

23:07.177 --> 23:09.304
Only on our competitor's lines.

23:09.305 --> 23:13.725
Actually, I was looking over your shoulder
and I saw your comment, so I asked.

23:13.726 --> 23:16.811
Just some criticism
of this book I'm reviewing.

23:16.812 --> 23:19.439
All and all, it's a very
shabby piece of research

23:19.440 --> 23:21.900
obscured by involuted style.

23:21.901 --> 23:24.110
Shabby research I can stand,

23:24.111 --> 23:28.257
but involuted style
really makes my ass drag.

23:31.619 --> 23:33.578
I can't believe that
you're a stewardess.

23:33.579 --> 23:35.496
Actually, I'm not.

23:35.497 --> 23:38.291
I'm a skyjacker in drag.

23:38.292 --> 23:40.627
That's reassuring.

23:40.628 --> 23:41.753
Now if you'll just
give me your name,

23:41.754 --> 23:45.131
I'll report it to the proper
authorities when we land.

23:45.132 --> 23:47.175
Jemima.

23:47.176 --> 23:48.635
And I'm Uncle Ben.

23:48.636 --> 23:51.220
I'm serious. That's really my name.

23:51.221 --> 23:55.308
Jemima Brown. My mother
was hooked on being ethnic.

23:55.309 --> 23:57.644
Or else turned on by a pancake.

23:57.645 --> 23:59.312
As long as we both agree that

23:59.313 --> 24:02.649
it's too much for a black chick
to have the name of Jemima.

24:02.650 --> 24:06.903
Oh, I don't know. I mean, people don't
forget you when your name is Jemima.

24:06.904 --> 24:09.989
I don't think people would forget
you if your name was Alfred.

24:09.990 --> 24:12.325
Goodness me, Dr. Hemlock.

24:12.326 --> 24:16.537
You're not the type of man who tries
to pick up stewardesses, are you?

24:16.538 --> 24:19.165
Not generally.
How'd you know my name?

24:19.166 --> 24:22.345
It's this mystical thing
I have with names.

24:23.671 --> 24:26.965
It's a gift from
the Dark Continent.

24:26.966 --> 24:30.426
I look at a person very carefully,

24:30.427 --> 24:32.261
and then I concentrate.

24:32.262 --> 24:33.846
And?

24:33.847 --> 24:37.401
And then, I go check his name
out on the passengers list.

24:38.310 --> 24:42.188
And what else do they call you
besides Jemima and Smart Ass?

24:42.189 --> 24:44.332
Jem, as in jewel.

24:46.610 --> 24:48.945
Fasten your seat belt, sir.

24:48.946 --> 24:52.295
Oh, I have no intention
of trying to escape.

25:23.230 --> 25:27.000
Aren't you gonna get in,
or do you like it out there?

25:28.193 --> 25:29.569
I looked for you on the plane.

25:29.570 --> 25:31.372
No harm done.

25:35.325 --> 25:37.753
I was on my way to town and

25:38.537 --> 25:41.789
you looked so lonely,
I took pity on you.

25:41.790 --> 25:43.082
Well, that's an ancient trick.

25:43.083 --> 25:45.251
Whenever I'm waiting for a cab,

25:45.252 --> 25:48.963
I look lonely and maybe some
unbelievable beauty named Jemima

25:48.964 --> 25:50.548
will pick me up.

25:50.549 --> 25:53.009
Gonna have to be a
double fare, you know?

25:53.010 --> 25:54.093
Fine.

25:54.094 --> 25:59.599
You know, buddy, we ain't supposed
to pick up two fares in one location.

25:59.600 --> 26:02.852
Hey. Let's agree on a division of
labor right now. You do the driving.

26:02.853 --> 26:05.229
We'll do the talking.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.907
All right.

26:09.109 --> 26:11.986
How can you look so good when
you're starving to death?

26:11.987 --> 26:13.789
Am I starving to death?

26:16.867 --> 26:19.761
Mmm, you broil a
mean steak, Hemlock.

26:20.204 --> 26:23.289
Come on, I'll show you my lime pit.

26:23.290 --> 26:25.416
It's kind of scary looking.

26:32.257 --> 26:33.925
Maybe I should drop pieces of bread

26:33.926 --> 26:36.695
so I can find my way out.

26:42.434 --> 26:44.111
Jonathan!

26:45.604 --> 26:46.896
They're unbelievable.

26:46.897 --> 26:48.147
Not bad, huh?

26:48.148 --> 26:50.650
One of the better collections
in the neighborhood.

26:50.651 --> 26:52.703
You have El Greco down there,

26:53.403 --> 26:55.154
Matisse,

26:55.155 --> 26:56.798
Picasso,

26:57.741 --> 26:59.714
Clay, Matisse.

27:07.626 --> 27:09.961
Over here we have Pissarro.

27:09.962 --> 27:13.812
It's astonishing! I mean,
there's so much life in them.

27:14.633 --> 27:17.607
Yeah, I'm picking up
another one of his tomorrow.

27:23.767 --> 27:27.311
I've heard about guys like
you reading those books.

27:27.312 --> 27:31.242
Whips and boots and things.
But an ax? That's a little freaky.

27:31.775 --> 27:34.694
Call me a cab.
I'm getting outta here.

27:34.695 --> 27:36.362
Just some old climbing equipment.

27:36.363 --> 27:37.697
You climb?

27:37.698 --> 27:40.199
I used to, but I'm retired now.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.034
Maybe you'll climb again someday.

27:42.035 --> 27:43.703
I doubt it.

27:43.704 --> 27:46.122
However, you never know.
Sometimes people do things

27:46.123 --> 27:48.374
they thought they'd never do again.

27:48.375 --> 27:51.169
Like rape, for instance.

27:51.170 --> 27:53.462
Yeah. I thought I'd given up rape,

27:53.463 --> 27:55.765
but I think I've changed my mind.

28:02.556 --> 28:05.766
You really have beautiful eyes.

28:05.767 --> 28:07.602
Or do they all say that?

28:07.603 --> 28:09.520
All?

28:09.521 --> 28:11.118
Who all?

29:13.460 --> 29:14.585
Yeah.

29:14.586 --> 29:18.464
Good morning, baby.
There's coffee by your bed.

29:18.465 --> 29:20.841
The hell with coffee.
Where are you?

29:20.842 --> 29:25.943
Jonathan, it's important that you
contact Mr. Dragon as soon as possible.

29:27.641 --> 29:30.643
I'm sorry to drop it on
you like that, Jonathan.

29:30.644 --> 29:32.520
Baby, I'm sorry.

30:12.936 --> 30:15.313
Sorry for this, Hemlock.

30:15.314 --> 30:19.150
But twice a year, my blood
must be fully replaced.

30:19.151 --> 30:20.443
With what?

30:20.444 --> 30:22.695
You're very bitter
today, Dr. Hemlock.

30:22.696 --> 30:25.990
A joke. Bitter Hemlock.

30:25.991 --> 30:28.492
Listen, Dragon. I came
here for two reasons.

30:28.493 --> 30:30.536
One, to tell you that
using that Jemima Brown

30:30.537 --> 30:33.456
to steal my money
was low, even for you.

30:33.457 --> 30:35.875
And second, to get my money
and tax statement back.

30:35.876 --> 30:37.543
It will be returned to you.

30:37.544 --> 30:40.296
- And the tax statement?
- That, too.

30:40.297 --> 30:42.882
Well, then we have nothing
more to discuss, do we?

30:42.883 --> 30:47.887
There is still the sanction on the
second man who killed Agent Wormwood.

30:47.888 --> 30:52.224
I will give you another $20,000
for this second sanction.

30:52.225 --> 30:54.018
Forget it. I'm back in retirement.

30:54.019 --> 30:56.437
You are the only man who can do it.

30:56.438 --> 30:59.732
You could train Pope. He'd
be ready, in about 40 years.

30:59.733 --> 31:02.985
Would you leave Agent
Wormwood unrevenged?

31:02.986 --> 31:05.488
Well, those are the breaks.

31:05.489 --> 31:08.793
Did you know who Agent
Wormwood was, Dr. Hemlock?

31:09.201 --> 31:12.220
Wormwood was Henri Baq.

31:15.916 --> 31:17.249
Henri Baq?

31:17.250 --> 31:18.722
Yes.

31:21.463 --> 31:23.464
I thought he was retired
and living in Paris.

31:23.465 --> 31:26.359
He approached C-2
and asked for work.

31:26.760 --> 31:30.054
Apparently, he had
financial difficulties.

31:30.055 --> 31:32.681
We tried to be helpful.

31:32.682 --> 31:36.577
Unfortunately, it
turned out tragically.

31:37.187 --> 31:38.938
Why wasn't I told
about this before?

31:38.939 --> 31:42.191
We had reasons.
They did not concern you.

31:42.192 --> 31:46.529
We preferred that you took the
sanction for your usual reasons,

31:46.530 --> 31:48.948
greed and avarice.

31:48.949 --> 31:50.950
- Henri Baq was my friend.
- Yes.

31:50.951 --> 31:52.034
He saved my life once.

31:52.035 --> 31:53.507
Yes.

31:54.162 --> 31:56.455
Then why am I the only one who
can perform this sanction?

31:56.456 --> 31:58.666
First, do you
accept the assignment?

31:58.667 --> 32:00.084
Yes, I accept.

32:00.085 --> 32:02.795
What we have is this.

32:02.796 --> 32:04.755
The target is male.

32:04.756 --> 32:07.842
He is an accomplished
mountain climber.

32:07.843 --> 32:11.011
We learned this from
a note we intercepted.

32:11.012 --> 32:13.861
Also, a witness said he limped.

32:15.142 --> 32:16.559
Well, that's fine.

32:16.560 --> 32:19.645
Now all I have to do is kill every
mountain climber with a sore foot.

32:19.646 --> 32:21.063
Not quite.

32:21.064 --> 32:25.119
Our man will be involved in a
climb in the Alps this summer.

32:25.444 --> 32:26.986
You're getting warm now, Dragon.

32:26.987 --> 32:29.321
That narrows it down to
three or four thousand men.

32:29.322 --> 32:31.073
Fewer than that.

32:31.074 --> 32:34.218
We know which mountain
he will climb.

32:35.495 --> 32:36.537
And?

32:36.538 --> 32:38.260
The Eiger.

32:40.459 --> 32:41.876
North face, of course.

32:41.877 --> 32:43.544
That is correct.

32:43.545 --> 32:45.643
You are familiar with it?

32:48.175 --> 32:49.300
You know I am.

32:49.301 --> 32:52.678
I tried to climb it twice.
It tried to kill me twice.

32:52.679 --> 32:55.014
Look, if the target's trying to
climb the north face of the Eiger,

32:55.015 --> 32:57.183
chances are my work
could be done for me.

32:57.184 --> 33:00.488
I cannot trust
to chance, Dr. Hemlock.

33:01.021 --> 33:06.859
Now, the only climb planned for
the Eiger is a goodwill climb

33:06.860 --> 33:09.904
with a team from Germany, Austria,

33:09.905 --> 33:12.424
France and the United States.

33:12.866 --> 33:16.841
Now, the target is
one of the other climbers,

33:17.412 --> 33:20.966
the Frenchman, the German
or the Austrian.

33:21.374 --> 33:25.878
We are continuing to work
to try to identify him.

33:25.879 --> 33:28.380
Undoubtedly, we will have his name

33:28.381 --> 33:32.026
before it is necessary
for you to climb the Eiger.

33:32.719 --> 33:36.889
You're passing over one small
matter, and that is payment.

33:36.890 --> 33:41.977
Naturally, considering the rigors of the
assignment, we intend to be generous.

33:41.978 --> 33:45.981
You will receive $30,000.

33:45.982 --> 33:48.400
I'm sure that's
more than you expected.

33:48.401 --> 33:50.611
More than I expected,
but less than I'll receive.

33:50.612 --> 33:52.238
Oh?

33:52.239 --> 33:54.156
Yeah. I'll receive $100,000,

33:54.157 --> 33:56.242
plus expenses, of course.

33:56.243 --> 33:59.797
You recognize that
this is outrageous?

34:01.081 --> 34:03.600
Well, I'm viewing this
as retirement pay.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.585
This is definitely
my last assignment.

34:06.586 --> 34:10.880
You are punishing us for using
Jemima Brown? Is that it?

34:10.882 --> 34:12.341
You need me to
perform the sanction,

34:12.342 --> 34:13.592
just pay the money.

34:13.592 --> 34:16.971
You drive a hard bargain, Hemlock,

34:16.972 --> 34:19.723
but to show you there
are no hard feelings,

34:19.724 --> 34:22.402
I'm going to give you a bonus.

34:22.936 --> 34:24.812
Oh, pardon me while I choke.

34:24.813 --> 34:26.938
You will appreciate this.

34:26.940 --> 34:30.039
The bonus is Miles Mellough.

34:30.694 --> 34:33.279
Miles? What does he have
to do with all this?

34:33.280 --> 34:38.210
It appears that after the
microfilm was stolen from Worm...

34:38.702 --> 34:41.704
Henri Baq, Miles Mellough
was the courier

34:41.705 --> 34:44.349
who carried it to the enemy.

34:44.833 --> 34:47.208
Since he was not
one of the killers,

34:47.210 --> 34:50.838
a sanction, technically,
is not called for.

34:50.839 --> 34:54.063
However, you may
have it if you wish.

34:54.634 --> 34:56.302
I accept the bonus.

34:56.303 --> 34:58.470
I thought you might.

34:58.471 --> 35:02.391
I imagine this will be the last
time that you will be here.

35:02.392 --> 35:04.435
I shall miss you, Hemlock.

35:04.436 --> 35:07.855
You know, Dragon, you could have
saved yourself a lot of trouble

35:07.856 --> 35:09.481
if you'd have told me to begin with

35:09.482 --> 35:11.984
that the dead agent in
Zurich was Henri Baq.

35:11.985 --> 35:16.155
Good luck, Hemlock,
on your latest assignment,

35:16.156 --> 35:18.424
the Eiger Sanction.

35:37.135 --> 35:39.688
Wild Turkey on the rocks, hmm?

35:40.305 --> 35:42.528
It's right downstairs.

35:58.907 --> 36:02.451
I guess I shouldn't have dropped
it on you like that, Jonathan.

36:02.452 --> 36:06.052
Just how should you have
dropped it on me, Jemima?

36:07.874 --> 36:09.375
I just couldn't let it go...

36:09.376 --> 36:11.543
I mean, I couldn't let us
go on without you knowing

36:11.544 --> 36:14.017
that I work for Mr. Dragon.

36:15.382 --> 36:19.186
And I didn't have enough guts
to tell you face-to-face.

36:19.719 --> 36:22.054
Boy, I must've been really dazzled

36:22.055 --> 36:24.890
not to notice all
those coincidences.

36:24.891 --> 36:27.726
You on the same plane, just
happening by with the taxi cab,

36:27.727 --> 36:29.728
discovering the note from Dragon.

36:29.729 --> 36:31.563
How was it supposed to work?

36:31.564 --> 36:35.609
Were you supposed to deny me your
body if I don't accept this sanction?

36:35.610 --> 36:37.736
Don't make it sound
so cheap, Jonathan.

36:37.737 --> 36:40.836
Just too shabby
to even be called cheap.

36:41.616 --> 36:42.950
For your information,

36:42.951 --> 36:45.049
I was not assigned to seduce you.

36:55.046 --> 36:57.673
How long have you
worked for Dragon?

36:57.674 --> 36:59.299
Only a month.

36:59.300 --> 37:02.570
But I've been a C-2
courier for five years.

37:04.431 --> 37:07.766
Jonathan, do you understand how
important this sanction is?

37:07.767 --> 37:09.768
I mean, the film that was
stolen from Wormwood...

37:09.769 --> 37:12.071
His name was Henri Baq.

37:13.940 --> 37:18.277
Well, the stolen microfilm involves
a new formula for germ warfare.

37:18.278 --> 37:21.488
And I'm supposed to get it
back by killing people?

37:21.489 --> 37:25.284
Let me tell you something I'm sure
you're not aware of, Aunt Jemima.

37:25.285 --> 37:29.288
You know what purpose these sanctions
serve? Absolutely none at all.

37:29.289 --> 37:32.583
They're just retaliation. They kill
one of ours, we kill the killers.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.835
No purpose at all, just barbaric.

37:34.836 --> 37:36.336
You're getting religion
a little late.

37:36.337 --> 37:39.840
I didn't quit because of religion.
I quit because of mathematics.

37:39.841 --> 37:40.966
Oh?

37:40.967 --> 37:42.217
That's right.

37:42.218 --> 37:44.428
The odds are stacking
up against me.

37:44.429 --> 37:48.640
Assassins who stay too long wind up
assassinated, and that ain't in my game plan.

37:48.641 --> 37:50.113
But...

37:56.399 --> 38:00.068
Look, I don't pretend to know
what Mr. Dragon's thinking,

38:00.069 --> 38:03.906
but there's a formula for germ warfare
out there and the other side has it.

38:03.907 --> 38:06.450
I'm sure he knows what he's doing.

38:06.451 --> 38:10.370
It's dangerous, child, to come to
conclusions when you don't have any facts.

38:10.371 --> 38:12.039
Now, let me lay some on you.

38:12.040 --> 38:13.540
Sure, Dragon knows what he's doing,

38:13.541 --> 38:14.833
just like he knew what he was doing

38:14.834 --> 38:17.336
when he worked for the
Nazis during World War II.

38:17.337 --> 38:20.005
- What?
- Oh, you didn't know that, did you?

38:20.006 --> 38:22.674
Yes, your wrap 'em up in red,
white, and blue Mr. Dragon's

38:22.675 --> 38:24.635
a goddamn Hessian,
that's what he is.

38:24.636 --> 38:27.513
And he'd sell out the other side
as fast as he'd sell out our side.

38:27.514 --> 38:31.614
He'd sell out his mother, too,
if the bloodless freak had one!

38:34.354 --> 38:37.940
You think it's so awful the
other side has a germ formula?

38:37.941 --> 38:39.608
It's against the
Geneva Convention, isn't it?

38:39.609 --> 38:41.401
And they stole it from us.

38:41.402 --> 38:43.362
Well, what the hell are we doing
with it in the first place?

38:43.363 --> 38:46.291
We're not supposed
to have one either.

38:47.826 --> 38:52.006
And you don't see any difference
between their side and our side?

38:52.497 --> 38:56.500
Yeah, I see a difference. As long as we
have Dragons and Popes working for us,

38:56.501 --> 38:59.099
how bad can the other side be?

39:02.090 --> 39:04.188
Where's my change?

39:11.599 --> 39:13.776
$10,000.

39:29.242 --> 39:31.577
This is Henri Baq.

39:31.578 --> 39:33.912
I had a bullet in me once, and
he carried me for three days.

39:33.913 --> 39:36.748
I owe him one. He was a friend.

39:36.749 --> 39:39.001
Who's that man?

39:39.002 --> 39:41.270
That's Miles Mellough.

39:41.588 --> 39:44.965
He's the guy who tipped off the
people who put the bullet in me.

39:44.966 --> 39:46.643
An enemy.

39:47.427 --> 39:49.428
And him?

39:49.429 --> 39:53.098
That's Ben Bowman. He and I
used to climb a lot together.

39:53.099 --> 39:56.059
I'm going out to his climbing
school and get in shape.

39:56.060 --> 39:58.738
Friends, enemies.

39:59.606 --> 40:01.231
Where do I fit in?

40:01.232 --> 40:03.534
I'm sorry, but you don't.

40:04.569 --> 40:08.248
Here's to the selfish killer
and the patriotic whore.

40:10.116 --> 40:13.135
Do you have anything
else to say to me?

40:13.953 --> 40:16.830
I usually keep a twenty in the
bowl there, by the kitchen door.

40:16.831 --> 40:19.759
You might pick it up
on your way out.

41:07.590 --> 41:10.550
Goddamn my eyes!
How the hell are you?

41:10.551 --> 41:12.511
Goddamn, you're looking good.

41:12.512 --> 41:15.681
A little soft maybe, but,
goddamn, I'm glad to see you.

41:15.682 --> 41:18.475
How the hell have you been? Boy,
are we gonna drink a lot of beer!

41:18.476 --> 41:21.144
Wait till you see the goddamn
place. How the hell are you?

41:21.145 --> 41:23.271
Jesus Christ, Jon, don't
you ever say anything?

41:23.272 --> 41:26.621
Well, I'm waiting for
your mouth to get tired.

41:35.868 --> 41:38.078
Just down the road
a piece, old buddy.

41:38.079 --> 41:39.454
About 20 miles, as I remember.

41:39.455 --> 41:40.956
Uh-huh.

41:42.041 --> 41:44.251
Nice leisurely five-minute ride.

41:44.252 --> 41:47.021
Only when I'm in a hurry.

42:00.727 --> 42:02.019
No need to hurry, Ben.

42:02.020 --> 42:03.270
That's why I'm taking it
nice and easy.

42:03.271 --> 42:05.397
You ain't gonna
recognize the old place.

42:05.398 --> 42:06.745
Hope I live to see it.

42:10.570 --> 42:12.988
That city life has spoiled
you, made you kind of soft.

42:12.989 --> 42:15.282
You ain't a pansy yet, are you?

42:15.283 --> 42:17.993
Let's just stop this death
trap and I'll show you.

42:21.039 --> 42:22.414
What's so funny?

42:22.415 --> 42:24.791
I was just thinking of
the last time we climbed.

42:24.792 --> 42:27.878
You had to haul my ass
down off that mountain.

42:27.879 --> 42:30.682
That's liable to turn out to
be one of my bigger mistakes.

42:34.635 --> 42:36.261
Still do any climbing, Ben?

42:36.262 --> 42:38.930
No. Nothing a pissant
couldn't hop over.

42:38.931 --> 42:42.434
I ain't a climber, anyway.
I'm an impresario.

42:42.435 --> 42:44.394
- Huh?
- An impresario.

42:44.395 --> 42:47.898
At least, that's what they
call me. That ain't dirty, is it?

42:47.899 --> 42:49.542
Could be.

42:54.113 --> 42:55.697
When did this all happen?

42:55.698 --> 42:58.658
Oh, about two years.
What do you think of it?

42:58.659 --> 43:01.870
- Well...
- I know. It's so frigging
ugly, it makes me sick.

43:01.871 --> 43:04.039
But it keeps me in moccasins.

43:04.040 --> 43:07.389
I've been taken over
by the swinging singles!

43:08.628 --> 43:10.295
What happened to
the climbing school?

43:10.296 --> 43:11.630
Ha!

43:11.631 --> 43:15.592
My guests are more interested in
hunting than they are in climbing.

43:15.593 --> 43:18.428
Thought the whole point
of climbing was hunting.

43:18.429 --> 43:21.181
Damned if you ain't right, Jon.

43:21.182 --> 43:23.484
Damned if you ain't right.

43:26.312 --> 43:27.738
Well,

43:28.022 --> 43:29.773
this is really interesting, Ben.

43:29.774 --> 43:30.982
Uh-huh, yeah.

43:30.983 --> 43:33.693
Begins to look like I'll make
it through the winter, huh?

43:33.694 --> 43:35.541
Two brews.

43:36.489 --> 43:38.507
Not bad.

43:39.659 --> 43:41.927
Thanks. Not bad at all.

43:42.078 --> 43:44.996
I think I like the old place
better though. More character.

43:44.997 --> 43:46.706
Character and unpaid bills,
old buddy.

43:46.707 --> 43:48.500
Goddamn, I'm glad to see you!

43:48.501 --> 43:51.753
Dealing with these phony bastards
really makes my ass weary.

43:51.754 --> 43:54.339
That's the perils
of being an impresario.

43:54.340 --> 43:56.967
You sure that ain't a dirty word?

43:56.968 --> 43:59.886
Shut up and drink your beer.

43:59.887 --> 44:01.939
On, God. My, my!

44:02.849 --> 44:04.516
All right. Beat it, Buns.

44:06.269 --> 44:08.353
At least I know you're not
here for the hunting.

44:08.354 --> 44:10.230
Psst! Psst!

44:10.231 --> 44:14.234
But your wire made it sound like more
than just a visit to an old buddy.

44:14.235 --> 44:16.736
It is, Ben. I want you to get
me in shape for a climb.

44:16.737 --> 44:18.280
Much of a climb?

44:18.281 --> 44:20.299
Eiger, north face.

44:20.908 --> 44:22.450
You're kidding?

44:22.451 --> 44:25.328
Nope, I'm part of an
international team.

44:25.329 --> 44:27.205
I know about that
international climb.

44:27.206 --> 44:29.541
Lawrence Scott heads the U.S. team.

44:29.542 --> 44:31.685
He had an accident.

44:33.713 --> 44:36.516
How old are you, Jon? Thirty-five?

44:37.383 --> 44:39.685
- Give or take.
- Uh-huh.

44:40.136 --> 44:42.012
I know what you're thinking,
Ben, but I have to go.

44:42.013 --> 44:43.221
You've been to the Eiger before.

44:43.222 --> 44:44.848
- Twice.
- And you know what it's like.

44:44.849 --> 44:46.683
Ben, I'm going, God damn it.

44:46.684 --> 44:49.394
All right. All right. I did what a
good friend's supposed to do.

44:49.395 --> 44:51.980
I tried to talk you
out of it, right?

44:51.981 --> 44:53.732
Now I'm gonna tell you the truth.

44:53.733 --> 44:55.775
Horseshit! I'm going with you!

44:55.776 --> 44:57.068
You, going to the Eiger?

44:57.069 --> 44:59.196
I'm the ground man for that climb.

44:59.197 --> 45:01.156
Ain't that enough
to singe your ass!

45:01.157 --> 45:03.700
I'm gonna nursemaid you again
after all of these years.

45:03.701 --> 45:04.784
You nursemaid me?

45:04.785 --> 45:06.870
I not only could out-climb
you on your best day,

45:06.871 --> 45:08.622
I can out-drink you right now.

45:08.623 --> 45:09.915
Well, you just enjoy that one,

45:09.916 --> 45:14.085
'cause you're off the sauce until
you're in shape for the climb.

45:14.086 --> 45:16.639
Meanwhile, I'll have another.

45:48.162 --> 45:50.121
Well, this is where I turn back.

45:50.122 --> 45:53.016
- Thank God.
- Not you. You need the work.

45:53.960 --> 45:56.934
George there will take you on up.

45:57.255 --> 45:59.307
She's a girl.

46:00.299 --> 46:02.384
A lot of people notice that.

46:02.385 --> 46:06.721
All right, George. Give him a workout,
then bring him back for a meal.

46:06.722 --> 46:08.945
I'll see you, old buddy.

46:23.656 --> 46:26.616
You don't have to do
everything he says.

46:26.617 --> 46:30.638
After all, this is a chance to
strike back at the white man.

48:23.526 --> 48:27.547
Hi. I'd like some
French Onion Soup,

48:27.863 --> 48:29.614
crabmeat cocktail,

48:29.615 --> 48:30.990
broiled lobster tails,

48:30.991 --> 48:33.159
and Wild Turkey
on the rocks, please.

48:33.160 --> 48:35.745
Very good, sir.

48:35.746 --> 48:37.889
Well, that was quick.

49:02.481 --> 49:04.124
Well,

49:04.817 --> 49:07.290
what do you think of George?

49:08.487 --> 49:12.365
Very warm, humane person.

49:12.366 --> 49:14.492
Gives great conversation, too.

49:14.493 --> 49:16.161
But she's a climbing fool,
ain't she?

49:16.162 --> 49:17.839
Boy, that she is.

49:18.747 --> 49:22.625
Wore me down, but
I'll do better tomorrow.

49:22.626 --> 49:25.503
Tomorrow? Today, me bucko.

49:25.504 --> 49:28.523
You go back out again
right after lunch.

49:45.900 --> 49:50.528
You'd be well-advised to have a
good reason for making this call.

49:50.529 --> 49:52.322
Rise and shine, old buddy.

49:52.323 --> 49:55.843
Oh. Go piss up a rope.

50:09.924 --> 50:11.771
Just scalp me.

50:12.468 --> 50:15.817
God damn it! I wish
Custer would have won.

50:44.667 --> 50:47.311
Time to rise and shine...

51:14.822 --> 51:17.090
Screw Marlon Brando.

52:05.998 --> 52:08.207
Dirty, rotten...

52:08.208 --> 52:14.641
Dirty, evil, scheming,
devious bitch.

52:29.188 --> 52:33.149
Leave Dr. Hemlock alone, Faggot.

52:33.150 --> 52:34.984
Forgive him, Jonathan,
but I'm afraid Faggot

52:34.985 --> 52:38.539
has not learned to
recognize you straights.

52:38.906 --> 52:40.698
Miles.

52:40.699 --> 52:44.503
My, my, aren't we
looking splendid, Jonathan?

52:45.037 --> 52:47.214
How long has it been?

52:47.706 --> 52:49.474
Indochina,

52:49.708 --> 52:53.603
you and me and Henri Baq.

52:54.505 --> 52:57.465
And I haven't made
a verbal blunder.

52:57.466 --> 53:01.636
Actually, it's about Henri
that I wish to chat.

53:01.637 --> 53:05.098
Miles, the only thing
you and I have to chat about

53:05.099 --> 53:08.768
is you having an incurable disease
and lack the guts to kill yourself.

53:08.769 --> 53:12.689
Very good, Jonathan. Very good.
You've grown a great deal.

53:12.690 --> 53:14.412
But wrong!

53:15.234 --> 53:17.485
Should we be sensible
and have a drink?

53:17.486 --> 53:19.288
Waiter!

53:20.739 --> 53:23.658
We'd like to order
some drinks, please.

53:23.659 --> 53:28.089
A Wild Turkey on the rocks for
my good friend, the doctor.

53:29.123 --> 53:31.541
And I would like...

53:31.542 --> 53:34.686
I would like a frozen daiquiri.

53:39.258 --> 53:41.401
Well... Miss?

53:43.011 --> 53:46.347
Oh, Miss. May I know
your name, please?

53:46.348 --> 53:48.182
Buns.

53:48.183 --> 53:50.435
Yes, of course it is.

53:50.436 --> 53:52.729
Miss Buns, I wonder if
you'd be a gentleperson

53:52.730 --> 53:55.231
and take my roomie for a stroll?

53:55.232 --> 53:57.442
Sure, anything.

53:57.443 --> 54:00.121
I'm sure. Off you go.

54:01.155 --> 54:04.782
His name is Faggot.

54:04.783 --> 54:06.551
That's cute.

54:07.327 --> 54:10.913
Be careful he doesn't
rape you. Charming.

54:10.914 --> 54:13.012
Ah, here we are.

54:14.001 --> 54:15.334
Well, you're a very

54:15.335 --> 54:16.978
handsome young man.

54:21.592 --> 54:24.427
I would say he's made,
wouldn't you, Jonathan?

54:24.428 --> 54:26.730
I assume you're covered.

54:30.184 --> 54:33.613
Uh-huh. Your assumption is correct.

54:34.146 --> 54:35.868
At the bar.

54:38.692 --> 54:40.693
That's your cover?

54:40.694 --> 54:43.654
Uh-huh. Dewayne is very strong.

54:43.655 --> 54:45.281
He was a world's champion.

54:45.282 --> 54:47.425
Weren't they all?

54:49.745 --> 54:51.496
Must seem odd to you
that I've looked you up

54:51.497 --> 54:53.470
after all these years.

54:53.999 --> 54:56.472
But you see, Jonathan, I'm...

54:57.503 --> 54:59.253
I've grown very tired
of waiting for you

54:59.254 --> 55:01.672
to step up behind me one day

55:01.673 --> 55:04.067
and relieve me of existing.

55:04.593 --> 55:07.646
Stepping up behind is
your method, Miles.

55:08.388 --> 55:11.111
I wanna look right into your face.

55:11.600 --> 55:13.994
Yes, I'm sure you would.

55:14.561 --> 55:17.230
However, that does not
enhance my cool.

55:17.231 --> 55:19.454
It'll all be over soon.

55:20.818 --> 55:22.735
Funnily enough, I find myself

55:22.736 --> 55:25.488
in a very strong
bargaining position.

55:25.489 --> 55:27.365
Forget it.

55:27.366 --> 55:29.339
Not even curious?

55:30.661 --> 55:33.955
You betrayed the both of us in Asia

55:33.956 --> 55:36.457
and we lived, no thanks to you.

55:36.458 --> 55:39.085
Now you people have
killed Henri in Zurich.

55:39.086 --> 55:41.212
I didn't actually
kill him, you know.

55:41.213 --> 55:44.382
Well, I probably
won't actually kill you.

55:44.383 --> 55:47.134
That's very little comfort.

55:47.135 --> 55:51.235
Henri was a worthless alcoholic,
and I abhor sloppy drunks.

56:03.360 --> 56:05.503
I'll allow you that.

56:07.114 --> 56:10.509
It's the price I must pay
to get you to listen.

56:12.119 --> 56:15.580
I did not, I repeat, I did not

56:15.581 --> 56:18.082
participate in that killing.

56:18.083 --> 56:21.057
Because unlike you,
I am not an animal.

56:21.670 --> 56:24.223
But I do know who did the killing.

56:25.465 --> 56:28.634
You got one, and now
you're after the other.

56:28.635 --> 56:32.360
Dragon has promised you
the identity of this person.

56:33.390 --> 56:35.738
Maybe. Maybe not.

56:36.268 --> 56:40.414
The point, I know
who this person is.

56:41.148 --> 56:43.065
And until you get that information,

56:43.066 --> 56:45.735
you're in great, great danger.

56:45.736 --> 56:47.162
How?

56:48.572 --> 56:50.907
Suppose I were to tell this person

56:50.908 --> 56:53.131
who and what you are?

56:53.619 --> 56:55.637
He would hunt you.

56:56.121 --> 56:58.164
You'd sell this man out for me?

56:58.165 --> 56:59.457
For what I want in this life,

56:59.458 --> 57:01.792
I would even sell my dear mother.

57:01.793 --> 57:03.561
How true.

57:04.463 --> 57:08.267
What I need from you is your
promise to leave me alone.

57:08.508 --> 57:10.560
What do you say?

57:14.806 --> 57:18.643
All right. I'll give you
my answer in a minute.

57:18.644 --> 57:21.437
Whichever way it goes,

57:21.438 --> 57:23.661
we were friends once.

57:38.830 --> 57:42.541
As you can see, Miles
and I have made up.

57:42.542 --> 57:44.765
Can I buy you a drink?

57:45.837 --> 57:48.481
Get him whatever he's having.

57:53.345 --> 57:55.513
I'm sure glad, too.

57:55.514 --> 57:58.488
I'd hate to tangle
with a guy your size.

57:59.351 --> 58:01.699
Just want you to know.

58:14.616 --> 58:17.535
Now I'm gonna tell you something.

58:17.536 --> 58:20.037
And listen, 'cause I'm
gonna ask questions later.

58:20.038 --> 58:22.540
I don't like you on my
flank 'cause it scares me.

58:22.541 --> 58:24.875
I don't like being scared.

58:24.876 --> 58:27.336
If you ever come near me
again, I'm gonna kill you.

58:27.337 --> 58:29.547
Understand? Understand?

58:29.548 --> 58:30.631
Yes.

58:30.632 --> 58:32.525
Good boy.

58:51.570 --> 58:53.738
Hope you told your cook
we'd be back for lunch.

58:53.739 --> 58:55.531
You're full of
piss and vinegar today.

58:55.532 --> 58:58.534
You promise to have mercy
on an old man like me?

58:58.535 --> 59:01.162
You wanna lead? You've
been up this before.

59:01.163 --> 59:03.591
No, I'll just tag along.

59:08.336 --> 59:09.670
This the right way?

59:09.671 --> 59:11.894
It's one way, I guess.

59:13.425 --> 59:15.259
You're a big help.

59:15.260 --> 59:18.512
I wanna know why you busted
that guy's head at the pool.

59:18.513 --> 59:19.597
Rock.

59:19.598 --> 59:22.526
All right, it's none
of my fucking business.

59:23.143 --> 59:25.061
You know what?

59:25.062 --> 59:28.606
Way down deep, you got the
makings of a real bad ass.

59:28.607 --> 59:31.442
I don't know that I'd like to be
alone on a desert island with you

59:31.443 --> 59:32.943
if there was a shortage of food.

59:32.944 --> 59:35.029
Don't worry. You're a friend.

59:35.030 --> 59:36.781
You ever had any enemies?

59:36.782 --> 59:37.907
A few.

59:37.908 --> 59:39.784
Any of them still around?

59:39.785 --> 59:41.758
The guy by the pool.

59:42.579 --> 59:46.290
Miles Mellough. What do
you know about him?

59:46.291 --> 59:47.792
He checked in today.

59:47.793 --> 59:51.128
He looks like he could change
a nine dollar bill in threes.

59:51.129 --> 59:52.213
Want me to throw him out?

59:52.214 --> 59:54.006
No, I want him right here.

59:54.007 --> 59:57.009
What about the other guy?
The big guy? You want him, too?

59:57.010 --> 59:58.803
Him, too.

59:58.804 --> 01:00:03.015
You set him up kind of neat for
an elderly college professor.

01:00:03.016 --> 01:00:04.308
You got me in shape.

01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:06.519
It's not that.

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:10.450
You set him up like you were
used to setting people up.

01:00:12.859 --> 01:00:17.084
You're climbing fine, Jon.
Better than I've ever seen you.

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:21.992
Well, I wish I was on the Eiger
right now, I'll tell you.

01:00:21.993 --> 01:00:24.662
Why go at all, Jon? Isn't
this enough of a climb?

01:00:24.663 --> 01:00:26.330
No way.

01:00:26.331 --> 01:00:27.998
I've gotta make it.

01:00:27.999 --> 01:00:30.251
Hey, have you ever met any of
these guys we're climbing with?

01:00:30.252 --> 01:00:32.419
Yeah, about a month ago.

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:34.296
And?

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:35.464
They're a good enough bunch.

01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:37.299
They've got a lot of
hills behind them.

01:00:38.677 --> 01:00:40.678
Any of 'em walk with a limp?

01:00:40.679 --> 01:00:43.848
Now, who in the hell could climb
with a limp? Now, wait a minute.

01:00:43.849 --> 01:00:48.102
The German was limping. Said
he hurt himself in a fall.

01:00:48.103 --> 01:00:52.523
Freytag, he's a funny guy.
Makes noise like a leader.

01:00:52.524 --> 01:00:54.191
Family makes bug spray.

01:00:54.192 --> 01:00:56.360
Got a lot of money, but he
doesn't like to talk about it.

01:00:56.361 --> 01:00:58.154
Anyway, he's got the look.

01:00:58.155 --> 01:00:59.446
What look?

01:00:59.447 --> 01:01:02.366
The look of a guy you couldn't
count on in a clutch.

01:01:02.367 --> 01:01:05.452
I wouldn't want to count
on him on that hill.

01:01:05.453 --> 01:01:08.455
- What about the Frenchman, Montaigne?
- Oh, Montaigne's all right.

01:01:08.456 --> 01:01:12.010
I think he's a little too old for
the Eiger. He's about your age.

01:01:13.545 --> 01:01:16.255
- Screw off, will you?
- I'd rather screw Montaigne's wife.

01:01:16.256 --> 01:01:18.340
She's a real brick shit-house.

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:21.343
Wait'll you catch her act.
She's a regular mantrap.

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:24.805
I feel sorry for the poor bastard,
trying to keep his eyes on her.

01:01:24.806 --> 01:01:27.850
Yeah? And what about the Austrian?

01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:30.227
Oh, you're gonna love him, Jon.

01:01:30.228 --> 01:01:34.023
Meyer doesn't give a rat's ass
about anything except climbing.

01:01:34.024 --> 01:01:36.901
All the people I talk to say
he's the kind of climber like...

01:01:36.902 --> 01:01:39.778
Well, like you used to be.

01:01:39.779 --> 01:01:41.572
You mean, before I got
decrepit and weak?

01:01:41.573 --> 01:01:45.201
You didn't look so decrepit and weak
yesterday, punching out that wrestler.

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:48.579
Anyway, this Meyer's really
something. He killed a guy once.

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:49.747
Oh?

01:01:49.748 --> 01:01:52.374
Yeah. A porter on a climb they were
making was stealing some food.

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:54.919
He killed him with a knife.
Isn't that something?

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:56.587
Sounds like a real charmer.

01:01:56.588 --> 01:02:01.258
Listen, Jon, if you got to rope
yourself to anybody on that hill,

01:02:01.259 --> 01:02:04.358
you make damn sure it's Meyer.

01:02:59.192 --> 01:03:02.486
This is a big man. You're the
only one who's climbed it.

01:03:02.487 --> 01:03:03.779
Uh-huh.

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:06.115
How'd you do it?

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:09.827
Guts, skill, determination,
all that sort of stuff.

01:03:09.828 --> 01:03:15.476
Hey, why don't we just call it a climb the
way it is and take the escalator down?

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:31.324
Okay, give me some slack.

01:04:16.811 --> 01:04:20.064
You gonna stand up there
all day admiring yourself?

01:04:20.065 --> 01:04:22.959
Or are you gonna bring me up?

01:04:23.902 --> 01:04:25.624
All right.

01:04:46.132 --> 01:04:49.468
Congratulations, old buddy.
You got her cherry.

01:04:49.469 --> 01:04:51.553
What do you mean?

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:53.847
You're the first one
ever to climb up here.

01:04:53.848 --> 01:04:56.100
Well, you climbed it
yourself, you told me.

01:04:56.101 --> 01:05:00.451
You ain't gonna get very far in
life listening to a liar like me.

01:05:01.272 --> 01:05:03.273
You were hoping
I'd quit, weren't you?

01:05:03.274 --> 01:05:05.984
Hoping I'd give up
on the Eiger climb.

01:05:05.985 --> 01:05:08.278
Let me tell you something, Ben.

01:05:08.279 --> 01:05:11.281
There's a damn good chance I might
not have to make the climb.

01:05:11.282 --> 01:05:15.202
I may be able to conclude my
business before the climb starts.

01:05:15.203 --> 01:05:16.286
No.

01:05:16.287 --> 01:05:21.458
Once you get over there, you're gonna
want to climb. That's the way you are.

01:05:21.459 --> 01:05:23.043
Want a beer?

01:05:23.044 --> 01:05:24.545
You gonna call room service?

01:05:24.546 --> 01:05:25.796
We got beer.

01:05:25.797 --> 01:05:28.465
If you hauled beer up
this rock, you're insane.

01:05:28.466 --> 01:05:30.676
I may be insane,
but I'm not stupid.

01:05:30.677 --> 01:05:34.106
I didn't carry it, you did.
It's in your pack.

01:05:36.057 --> 01:05:39.059
Jesus Christ! I ought to
throw you off this pillar.

01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:40.394
Besides, it's warm.

01:05:40.395 --> 01:05:41.728
Well, I'm sorry.

01:05:41.729 --> 01:05:44.373
I'd thought you'd draw
the line at hauling ice.

01:06:26.733 --> 01:06:28.376
Oh.

01:06:29.652 --> 01:06:32.080
Well, good evening, George.

01:06:32.864 --> 01:06:35.699
"Good evening, Dr. Hemlock."

01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:37.075
And how are you this fine evening?

01:06:37.076 --> 01:06:39.828
"Oh, I'm just fine, Doctor."

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:42.915
Did you watch that magnificent
climb Ben and I made today?

01:06:42.916 --> 01:06:45.334
"Yes, I did, Dr. Hemlock.

01:06:45.335 --> 01:06:47.353
"It sure was good."

01:06:48.379 --> 01:06:53.884
You know, George, I'm gonna
be leaving here soon,

01:06:53.885 --> 01:06:56.845
and I'm gonna kind of
miss you, in my way.

01:06:56.846 --> 01:06:59.306
"I'll miss you, too, Doctor."

01:06:59.307 --> 01:07:02.726
Um, one thing I'll
have to say, George,

01:07:02.727 --> 01:07:04.770
is you've never cluttered
up our relationship

01:07:04.771 --> 01:07:06.789
with any sticky sentiment.

01:07:07.941 --> 01:07:09.650
Maybe we should just
cut the chitchat

01:07:09.651 --> 01:07:13.000
and you just jump in
here and we'll get lucky.

01:07:33.258 --> 01:07:34.730
Ow!

01:07:54.946 --> 01:07:57.590
Desk! Desk!

01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:14.214
No.

01:08:14.215 --> 01:08:17.801
All right, now, take it easy.
Take it easy, old buddy.

01:08:17.801 --> 01:08:18.969
Ow.

01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:21.805
Doc says you're gonna be all right,
but you just got to take it slow.

01:08:21.805 --> 01:08:23.515
Where is she?

01:08:23.515 --> 01:08:25.642
I got her down in my room.

01:08:25.643 --> 01:08:28.478
My men are watching her.

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:30.188
Want me to call the sheriff?

01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:32.491
No, not yet.

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:35.944
- What happened to me.
- Miles Mellough. I knew you'd be wondering.

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:39.823
He's still here. The desk'll
call me if he makes a move.

01:08:39.823 --> 01:08:41.408
So it was Miles.

01:08:41.408 --> 01:08:43.551
That's what she said.

01:08:44.537 --> 01:08:45.871
Why'd she do it?

01:08:45.872 --> 01:08:48.300
Oldest reason in the world.

01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:50.042
Love?

01:08:50.042 --> 01:08:51.640
Money.

01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:54.837
What the hell did she
shoot into me, anyway?

01:08:54.839 --> 01:08:59.484
The doc says it was a relative of
morphine, but not enough to be fatal.

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:02.511
You know, morphine sounds right.

01:09:02.513 --> 01:09:04.348
Miles is in the drug business.

01:09:04.349 --> 01:09:06.850
Why the hell didn't
he polish you off?

01:09:06.850 --> 01:09:08.352
He told her it was
gonna be nothing serious.

01:09:08.353 --> 01:09:10.200
He just wanted to scare you.

01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:14.733
After George put me
under, my guess is,

01:09:14.734 --> 01:09:18.913
Miles was gonna come in and off
me in some spectacular fashion.

01:09:19.322 --> 01:09:22.783
Probably give me an O.D.
That sounds like his style.

01:09:22.783 --> 01:09:25.428
What are you gonna do about him?

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.138
Something massive.

01:09:29.207 --> 01:09:31.305
Something massive!

01:09:34.045 --> 01:09:36.689
Good morning, Dewayne.

01:09:39.133 --> 01:09:40.759
Well, good morning, Jonathan.

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:43.011
My, aren't we
looking chipper today?

01:09:43.011 --> 01:09:44.136
Sleep well?

01:09:44.138 --> 01:09:46.281
Very well, thank you.

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:50.779
You know, Miles, I think I'll forget
about you for the time being.

01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:54.648
Difficult task. Just like that?

01:09:54.649 --> 01:09:56.983
Well, you see, I'm gonna be
training here for a few more weeks,

01:09:56.984 --> 01:10:00.028
and I'm gonna need all my concentration
without having you in mind.

01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:03.907
Well, I do sympathize with you.
Truly, I do, Jonathan.

01:10:03.908 --> 01:10:08.213
But if this means you're going to
cross me off your list for good...

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:11.581
I might just do that.

01:10:15.461 --> 01:10:18.672
I'll tell you something. Why don't we
have dinner tonight and talk about it?

01:10:18.673 --> 01:10:20.924
Only if I can choose the wine.

01:10:20.925 --> 01:10:23.068
Look forward to it.

01:11:32.997 --> 01:11:34.719
Bastard!

01:11:37.585 --> 01:11:39.127
He hit his brakes.

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:41.004
No, he didn't.

01:11:41.005 --> 01:11:43.423
He turned the switch
on his headlights.

01:11:43.424 --> 01:11:46.443
Oh, Jonathan,
what a cheap, dirty trick.

01:11:46.803 --> 01:11:49.526
After him, Dewayne. After him!

01:12:15.248 --> 01:12:19.042
We've got him now. Look!

01:12:19.043 --> 01:12:22.893
We've got him trapped. He can't
turn around on this road.

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:39.614
Where the hell is he?

01:12:42.275 --> 01:12:44.150
Dewayne, there he is!

01:13:18.102 --> 01:13:21.451
Oh, Jonathan, you are an animal.

01:13:22.607 --> 01:13:25.285
Look at that dear gentleman.

01:13:26.444 --> 01:13:29.446
You tried to kill me.

01:13:29.447 --> 01:13:31.420
Get in the car.

01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:34.451
Uh-uh.

01:13:34.452 --> 01:13:36.470
Get in the car.

01:14:52.863 --> 01:14:54.614
Get out.

01:14:54.615 --> 01:14:57.634
What the hell are we
gonna do out here?

01:14:58.327 --> 01:15:00.004
Get out.

01:15:21.892 --> 01:15:24.194
Jonathan, you're
not going to shoot...

01:15:28.399 --> 01:15:31.919
Jonathan, you're not
going leave me out here!

01:15:39.493 --> 01:15:41.045
Jon...

01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:44.581
Oh, Jonathan, for Christ's sakes,

01:15:44.582 --> 01:15:47.226
kill me, but don't leave me here!

01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:51.222
You can't...

01:16:01.849 --> 01:16:04.934
Pretty quiet now, aren't
you, you little prick?

01:16:04.935 --> 01:16:07.533
Jonathan!

01:17:30.104 --> 01:17:32.188
Goddamn my ass,
what the hell do you mean,

01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:33.857
you ain't got any rooms for me?

01:17:33.858 --> 01:17:35.275
My dear Herr Bowman...

01:17:35.276 --> 01:17:36.401
My dear Herr's ass.

01:17:36.402 --> 01:17:39.404
You just stick your nose in that book
and you come up with my reservation.

01:17:39.405 --> 01:17:40.905
Hiya, buddy. You're looking good.

01:17:40.906 --> 01:17:42.407
What's the problem here?

01:17:42.408 --> 01:17:46.119
Oh, this rinky-dink has screwed up my
reservation. Says he can't find my telegram.

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:47.871
From the looks of him, he
couldn't find his tallywhacker

01:17:47.872 --> 01:17:49.706
with a six-man search party.

01:17:49.707 --> 01:17:52.917
I did not know this person was a
friend of yours, Dr. Hemlock.

01:17:52.918 --> 01:17:54.544
Yeah, well, he's
in charge of the climb.

01:17:54.545 --> 01:17:56.713
In charge of the climb? Oh, yes.

01:17:56.714 --> 01:17:59.549
Just one minute, please.

01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:00.925
All the Eiger birds are coming in.

01:18:00.926 --> 01:18:02.302
Maybe you should have
given him a tip.

01:18:02.303 --> 01:18:04.429
Yeah. Did you meet
the other climbers yet?

01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:07.223
They're supposed to be here
in the hotel. How's George?

01:18:07.224 --> 01:18:08.946
She's fine.

01:18:09.393 --> 01:18:11.144
Listen, about Miles...

01:18:11.145 --> 01:18:12.854
Look, later on that.

01:18:12.855 --> 01:18:14.272
Everything is in order.

01:18:14.273 --> 01:18:17.400
You will be with the other members
of the party on the 2nd floor.

01:18:17.401 --> 01:18:20.671
Room 216. I'll have
your luggage taken up.

01:18:21.197 --> 01:18:24.407
Yeah, and have them
send up a case of beer.

01:18:24.408 --> 01:18:26.534
You know, after you left,
all hell broke loose.

01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:28.036
Government agents
all over the place,

01:18:28.037 --> 01:18:30.705
asking questions, making
assholes of themselves.

01:18:30.706 --> 01:18:31.998
They find anything?

01:18:31.999 --> 01:18:34.209
Yeah, you know that big guy
you creamed in the bar?

01:18:34.210 --> 01:18:35.919
Found him blown in
half with a shotgun.

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:39.565
Miles, they found on the
sand, dead as Kelsey's nuts.

01:18:40.758 --> 01:18:42.842
What the hell are you here for?

01:18:42.843 --> 01:18:45.053
I don't want you to concern
yourself with that, Ben.

01:18:45.054 --> 01:18:47.597
I'm just here doing something
for an old friend.

01:18:47.598 --> 01:18:50.225
Let's call off the climb. Tell
them you're sick or something.

01:18:50.226 --> 01:18:52.977
You know I want
another shot at this hill.

01:18:52.978 --> 01:18:54.270
Herr Bowman?

01:18:54.271 --> 01:18:55.823
Yeah?

01:19:03.697 --> 01:19:08.468
Karl Freytag wants us in the
sitting room immediately.

01:19:10.537 --> 01:19:12.455
Stragglers will be shot.

01:19:12.456 --> 01:19:14.599
Only the lucky ones.

01:19:15.626 --> 01:19:18.429
Ah, lady, gentlemen.

01:19:19.046 --> 01:19:21.881
Jonathan Hemlock,
Jean-Paul Montaigne.

01:19:21.882 --> 01:19:24.259
- Jean-Paul.
- I've looked forward to
meeting you, Mr. Hemlock.

01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:25.969
My pleasure.

01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:28.429
This is my wife, Anna.

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:29.472
Anna.

01:19:29.473 --> 01:19:31.775
Hello. Care for a drink?

01:19:33.727 --> 01:19:36.280
And this is Karl Freytag.

01:19:36.981 --> 01:19:39.283
- Karl.
- Herr Doctor.

01:19:41.277 --> 01:19:43.528
And this is Andrei Meyer, Jon.

01:19:43.529 --> 01:19:46.155
- Hello.
- Andrei, I've read a lot about you.

01:19:46.156 --> 01:19:48.032
I used to read a lot about you.

01:19:48.033 --> 01:19:50.451
It appears that we've read
a lot about each other.

01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:52.537
It's snowing out there.
How are the weather reports?

01:19:52.538 --> 01:19:55.123
Oh, not too good. We've got
a couple of good days,

01:19:55.124 --> 01:19:57.542
and then we've got a bunch
of weak fronts moving in.

01:19:57.543 --> 01:19:59.377
It's gonna be
pretty dicey after that.

01:19:59.378 --> 01:20:01.170
Good, that settles it.

01:20:01.171 --> 01:20:02.213
Settles what?

01:20:02.214 --> 01:20:04.549
We must leave immediately.

01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:06.759
Do we have time to
finish our drinks?

01:20:11.682 --> 01:20:13.683
I mean, as soon as possible.

01:20:13.684 --> 01:20:15.893
With a storm coming in,
in maybe four days?

01:20:15.894 --> 01:20:18.187
Well, the Eiger has
been climbed in two.

01:20:18.188 --> 01:20:20.273
But supposing you
don't make it in two?

01:20:20.274 --> 01:20:22.358
Supposing you get pinned down
up there by the weather?

01:20:22.359 --> 01:20:24.652
Oh, Benjamin has a point there.

01:20:24.653 --> 01:20:26.738
We must not take childish risks.

01:20:26.739 --> 01:20:29.032
We can't climb without some risks.

01:20:29.033 --> 01:20:31.868
Perhaps the young face
these risks more easily.

01:20:31.869 --> 01:20:35.997
Good weather, bad weather. Now or
later, any time's good for climbing.

01:20:35.998 --> 01:20:37.123
All right, an impasse.

01:20:37.124 --> 01:20:38.541
Two in favor of climbing,
two opposed.

01:20:38.542 --> 01:20:41.252
The democratic process.

01:20:41.253 --> 01:20:46.229
What do you suggest, Doctor? Professor
Hemlock, that we climb halfway up?

01:20:47.343 --> 01:20:48.509
Ben has a vote.

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:51.054
Yeah, but he will not
be climbing with us.

01:20:51.055 --> 01:20:54.985
He's our ground man. Until we hit
the wall, he has complete control.

01:20:55.893 --> 01:20:57.852
Has that been decided?

01:20:57.853 --> 01:20:59.645
It's always like that.

01:20:59.646 --> 01:21:02.065
The ground man has
the last word now

01:21:02.066 --> 01:21:04.525
and the leader
once we're on the face.

01:21:04.526 --> 01:21:08.029
Okay, that brings us to another
issue. Who's to be the leader?

01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:09.238
I thought that was settled.

01:21:09.239 --> 01:21:11.199
I thought you were gonna lead.

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:13.910
Okay. That decision was made before

01:21:13.911 --> 01:21:18.122
the original American member of the
team had his unfortunate accident.

01:21:18.123 --> 01:21:20.124
You know, I think we should
make sure we agree on

01:21:20.125 --> 01:21:23.294
who's to lead, especially
now that you've joined us.

01:21:23.295 --> 01:21:28.299
You make a good point. Jonathan has
climbed the mountain twice before.

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:30.259
Correction, if I may. The good
doctor has failed to climb

01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:32.095
the mountain twice before.

01:21:32.096 --> 01:21:36.015
I don't want to offend you, Herr
Doctor, but I'm forced to say

01:21:36.016 --> 01:21:40.478
I don't consider a record of failure
automatically grants you the right to lead.

01:21:40.479 --> 01:21:41.979
I'm not offended.

01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:43.998
I think it's important
that you lead.

01:21:45.484 --> 01:21:48.503
Okay. Good, then,
let's come over here.

01:21:52.449 --> 01:21:54.626
Let's move over here.

01:21:55.953 --> 01:22:00.508
I've spent months studying
a new route up the Eiger.

01:22:01.291 --> 01:22:04.085
Taking the face by a new route
will put us in the record books.

01:22:04.086 --> 01:22:06.170
What is this new route?

01:22:06.171 --> 01:22:12.343
Okay, we won't take the Hinterstoisser
Traverse. Instead, we go this way.

01:22:12.344 --> 01:22:16.139
Our first bivouac should be high
above the difficult cracks.

01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:17.682
That's about here.

01:22:17.683 --> 01:22:20.810
And the next morning, we have to
move up this vertical rock face.

01:22:20.811 --> 01:22:22.895
That'll be pretty tough, I guess.

01:22:22.896 --> 01:22:27.191
We go all the way up and come out
next to the highest visible ice field.

01:22:27.192 --> 01:22:29.861
That's here. And then
it's up to the top.

01:22:29.862 --> 01:22:31.487
But nobody's ever been
on that part of the face.

01:22:31.488 --> 01:22:33.461
We don't know what's there.

01:22:33.991 --> 01:22:36.159
Supposing you can't
cling to the edges?

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:38.619
Suppose you get forced down
into the gut of the chute?

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:42.498
Well, I've no interest
in suicide, Ben.

01:22:42.499 --> 01:22:46.210
If the edges are not a go, we'll retreat
and follow one of the more classic routes.

01:22:46.211 --> 01:22:48.421
Where all that can
stop us is the weather.

01:22:48.422 --> 01:22:50.923
Just one thing.

01:22:50.924 --> 01:22:55.678
You know, your route doesn't allow for
retreat in case we're blocked from above.

01:22:55.679 --> 01:22:59.265
Well, I consider it self-defeating
to plan in terms of retreat.

01:22:59.266 --> 01:23:01.851
I consider it stupid not to.

01:23:01.852 --> 01:23:05.563
Okay, I'll leave the planning for
a retreat route to Dr. Hemlock.

01:23:05.564 --> 01:23:09.414
After all, he has more
experience than I in retreating.

01:23:10.986 --> 01:23:13.863
Okay, may I take it
my plan is accepted?

01:23:13.864 --> 01:23:15.336
Fine.

01:23:15.908 --> 01:23:17.617
Our business is settled.

01:23:17.618 --> 01:23:20.467
Now, I suggest we relax
and have a drink.

01:23:31.882 --> 01:23:35.026
Is this hotel always so crowded?

01:23:38.388 --> 01:23:40.806
Only when there's a climb.

01:23:40.807 --> 01:23:43.684
Then the Eiger birds
start flocking in.

01:23:43.685 --> 01:23:45.728
Eiger birds?

01:23:45.729 --> 01:23:47.104
Yeah, jet-setters.

01:23:47.105 --> 01:23:50.566
Assorted zombies who come
here to watch a climb.

01:23:50.567 --> 01:23:53.945
If they get lucky, they get to
watch a man die on the mountain.

01:23:53.946 --> 01:23:56.030
That's grim.

01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:58.004
So is the Eiger.

01:23:59.493 --> 01:24:01.887
It even looks grim.

01:24:02.704 --> 01:24:04.956
Do you have to go up?

01:24:04.957 --> 01:24:06.207
Unless the search division

01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:08.376
identities the assassin first.

01:24:08.377 --> 01:24:10.586
They've come up empty.

01:24:10.587 --> 01:24:14.298
Is that what you came here
to tell me? As a courier?

01:24:14.299 --> 01:24:16.259
I could have phoned.

01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:19.428
I just wanted to come up
and be with you.

01:24:19.429 --> 01:24:22.723
Oh, Jonathan, I had this
fantastic speech planned.

01:24:22.724 --> 01:24:24.642
I mean, I was going
to say it really quick

01:24:24.643 --> 01:24:26.811
before you interrupted me
or walked away.

01:24:26.812 --> 01:24:28.580
Well, how's it go?

01:24:29.106 --> 01:24:31.065
I forgot.

01:24:31.066 --> 01:24:34.860
Well, first, why don't you
tell me why you set me up?

01:24:34.861 --> 01:24:36.529
I did it because I believe

01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:38.753
you had to take this sanction.

01:24:41.618 --> 01:24:43.828
All right, I've taken it.

01:24:43.829 --> 01:24:45.955
And you and me,
working side by side,

01:24:45.956 --> 01:24:47.790
like loyal Americans,

01:24:47.791 --> 01:24:49.750
not to mention Dragon and Pope,

01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:51.794
will save the republic yet.

01:24:51.795 --> 01:24:53.754
Have you met the other climbers?

01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:54.797
Mmm-hmm.

01:24:54.798 --> 01:24:57.133
Any suspicions?

01:24:57.134 --> 01:24:58.884
Could be any one of them.

01:24:58.885 --> 01:25:01.529
Could even be Madam Montaigne.

01:25:02.139 --> 01:25:03.389
She's a very destructive woman.

01:25:03.390 --> 01:25:05.474
You know the type.

01:25:08.312 --> 01:25:09.955
I'm cold.

01:25:10.897 --> 01:25:13.791
Jonathan, you know
what I don't have?

01:25:14.818 --> 01:25:17.194
No. What don't you have?

01:25:17.195 --> 01:25:19.964
I don't have a room for the night.

01:25:20.490 --> 01:25:22.087
Jesus.

01:25:23.744 --> 01:25:28.140
I see, so you're a condemned
man's last wish, huh?

01:25:33.045 --> 01:25:36.047
4:00 p.m. We leave in 12 hours.

01:25:36.048 --> 01:25:40.009
We must do the first thousand feet
before the sun loosens the ice chunks.

01:25:40.010 --> 01:25:41.636
If the weather holds.

01:25:41.637 --> 01:25:44.847
It will hold.
It's certainly magnificent.

01:25:44.848 --> 01:25:47.850
A perfect choice
for my last mountain.

01:25:47.851 --> 01:25:49.852
Hey, Jon, sit down, have a beer.

01:25:49.853 --> 01:25:53.481
I've got a friend checking in, but I
guess I can always go for a beer.

01:25:53.482 --> 01:25:55.900
What's this about
your last mountain?

01:25:55.901 --> 01:25:58.444
Well, I'm not longer
young, Jonathan.

01:25:58.445 --> 01:26:04.367
Think of it. At 42, maybe I shall be
the oldest man to climb the Eiger.

01:26:04.368 --> 01:26:06.243
What do you think
about that, Madam?

01:26:06.244 --> 01:26:08.842
How do you feel about climbing?

01:26:09.289 --> 01:26:12.166
I consider mountain climbing
the biggest nonsense.

01:26:12.167 --> 01:26:14.877
I've never been in better shape.

01:26:14.878 --> 01:26:17.213
Ask Anna. Every night for 6 months,

01:26:17.214 --> 01:26:20.688
I perform two hours
of exercise before bed.

01:26:21.551 --> 01:26:25.596
By now, she must be very anxious
to see you climb the mountain.

01:26:25.597 --> 01:26:29.401
Doctor, a message from
the gentleman outside.

01:26:41.488 --> 01:26:45.658
I think I'll take a stroll. Madam
Montaigne, would you care to join me?

01:26:45.659 --> 01:26:48.703
Well, I think I shall
return to my room.

01:26:48.704 --> 01:26:50.881
If you will excuse me?

01:26:55.168 --> 01:26:56.811
Well.

01:27:01.216 --> 01:27:03.143
Well.

01:27:04.511 --> 01:27:06.011
What got into Jean-Paul?

01:27:06.012 --> 01:27:07.680
I don't know.
A little jumpy, I guess.

01:27:07.681 --> 01:27:09.390
You been jumping his wife?

01:27:09.391 --> 01:27:11.392
- No. Why?
- You sure?

01:27:11.393 --> 01:27:15.288
Well, I think it's something
I'd know. I'll see you later.

01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:26.003
Hey, Hemlock, how's it going?

01:27:27.117 --> 01:27:28.868
Nice place here.

01:27:28.869 --> 01:27:30.119
Get on with it, Pope.

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:31.996
Okay, pal, if that's the
game you want to play,

01:27:31.997 --> 01:27:34.790
we'll get right down
to the nitty-gritty.

01:27:34.791 --> 01:27:37.685
No one is
more qualified than you are.

01:27:38.962 --> 01:27:41.839
Search division has drawn
a blank on the target.

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:44.268
All we know is,
he's here somewhere.

01:27:46.136 --> 01:27:48.012
Miles Mellough knew who it was.

01:27:48.013 --> 01:27:49.610
He did?

01:27:53.477 --> 01:27:54.810
Did he tell you?

01:27:54.811 --> 01:27:58.481
He offered to,
but the price was too high.

01:27:58.482 --> 01:28:00.191
What'd he want then?

01:28:00.192 --> 01:28:01.650
To live.

01:28:01.651 --> 01:28:05.529
Oh. Well, I just came to tell
you that we've drawn a blank,

01:28:05.530 --> 01:28:07.782
and you'll have to climb.

01:28:07.783 --> 01:28:09.909
Jemima Brown told me that already.

01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:14.163
Jemima did, huh? Well, I just want
to make sure you got the message.

01:28:14.164 --> 01:28:17.684
You know how these Schwarzes
are. You can't really trust 'em.

01:28:19.252 --> 01:28:21.504
Pope, I really don't
mind you being an asshole.

01:28:21.505 --> 01:28:25.633
You can't really help that. But I do
mind you lying to me like I was a fool.

01:28:25.634 --> 01:28:27.510
Now you came here
with one thought in mind,

01:28:27.511 --> 01:28:32.317
and that was attach yourself to me so the
target would know who I am and what I am.

01:28:33.183 --> 01:28:37.078
Now who's gonna perform this
sanction if he gets me, you?

01:28:38.605 --> 01:28:41.704
You don't think I can handle it?

01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:45.027
In a locked closet with a grenade.

01:28:46.363 --> 01:28:48.631
Just a minute, buddy.

01:28:51.368 --> 01:28:54.995
Doesn't bother you a bit that
you've blown my cover, does it?

01:28:54.996 --> 01:28:57.390
Not one frigging bit, pal.

01:28:58.917 --> 01:29:01.168
And if I walk?

01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:02.812
No way.

01:29:03.213 --> 01:29:06.048
You wouldn't get
your hundred grand.

01:29:06.049 --> 01:29:07.883
You'd lose your paintings.

01:29:07.884 --> 01:29:11.688
And you'd probably spend some time
for smuggling them into the country.

01:29:12.639 --> 01:29:16.058
How does it feel being
in a box, sweetheart?

01:29:16.059 --> 01:29:18.435
You've done real well, Pope.

01:29:18.436 --> 01:29:20.688
Well, that's mighty white of you.

01:29:20.689 --> 01:29:23.274
Hey, that's a joke.

01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:29.665
I bet Jemima never says that
to you. "Mighty white of you."

01:29:30.115 --> 01:29:33.868
By the way, how's that black stuff?

01:29:33.869 --> 01:29:36.245
Pretty good, huh?

01:29:36.246 --> 01:29:41.552
I guess it's only fair to warn you in advance
I'm gonna have to waste you a little.

01:29:42.252 --> 01:29:44.753
Well, about your gun,
I got one waiting for you.

01:29:44.754 --> 01:29:48.090
It's at the hotel. It's a C-2
special with no serial numbers.

01:29:48.091 --> 01:29:50.314
It's in the candy box.

01:29:52.762 --> 01:29:55.723
Now what's this about wasting me?

01:29:55.724 --> 01:30:00.644
It's only fair to warn you, Hemlock,
that I'm a black belt in karate.

01:30:03.106 --> 01:30:04.749
Pope.

01:30:14.951 --> 01:30:16.798
Gee, I... Gee, I...

01:30:29.132 --> 01:30:31.150
Oh, my hand!

01:30:33.219 --> 01:30:34.862
Okay.

01:30:35.513 --> 01:30:37.640
You'll be all right now, Pope.

01:30:37.641 --> 01:30:41.644
Course, you may have trouble playing
the clarinet for a little while.

01:30:41.645 --> 01:30:45.648
Listen, sweetheart, baby, pal,

01:30:45.649 --> 01:30:48.609
I'm going back in the hotel,
and when I come out,

01:30:48.610 --> 01:30:52.255
I don't expect to see you
around anymore. Understand?

01:30:58.286 --> 01:30:59.453
Sleep well.

01:30:59.454 --> 01:31:02.303
Good night. See you tomorrow.

01:31:02.582 --> 01:31:04.166
Offer me a nightcap?

01:31:04.167 --> 01:31:06.168
Some other time, thanks.

01:31:06.169 --> 01:31:07.878
I wish you luck tomorrow.

01:31:07.879 --> 01:31:09.046
Thank you.

01:31:09.047 --> 01:31:11.090
I wish Jean-Paul
would change his mind.

01:31:11.091 --> 01:31:15.719
I can't understand why he's insisting
on climbing this mountain at his age.

01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:17.930
I can. He does it for you.

01:31:17.931 --> 01:31:19.264
What? For me?

01:31:19.265 --> 01:31:21.112
That's right.

01:31:22.727 --> 01:31:26.355
He tries to keep you from younger
men by staying young himself.

01:31:26.356 --> 01:31:28.533
By doing young men's things.

01:31:29.442 --> 01:31:30.693
Poor thing.

01:31:30.694 --> 01:31:33.838
Yeah. Particularly
since it hasn't worked.

01:32:19.534 --> 01:32:22.036
It's colder than a witch's tit.

01:32:22.037 --> 01:32:23.495
Good climbing weather, Ben.

01:32:23.496 --> 01:32:24.663
Now you listen to me, old buddy.

01:32:24.664 --> 01:32:25.914
You come down off
that hill in one piece

01:32:25.915 --> 01:32:27.791
or I'm gonna kick your ass!

01:32:27.792 --> 01:32:30.127
You're not gonna get
sloppy on me, are you?

01:32:30.128 --> 01:32:31.920
Now, look, you haven't
told me anything,

01:32:31.921 --> 01:32:34.339
but somehow I know that

01:32:34.340 --> 01:32:37.735
you and one of them foreigners
is gonna have some trouble.

01:32:39.179 --> 01:32:40.763
Maybe.

01:32:40.764 --> 01:32:44.516
Just guard your flank. Don't
take your eyes off of 'em.

01:32:44.517 --> 01:32:46.643
- I won't.
- Come on, let's be off!

01:32:46.644 --> 01:32:50.915
We must make our first move before
the sun unfreezes the rubble.

01:32:51.858 --> 01:32:53.705
Take care.

01:33:15.298 --> 01:33:17.692
Well, they're on their way.

01:33:18.510 --> 01:33:20.677
That frigging Hemlock.

01:33:20.678 --> 01:33:23.106
Thinks he's so goddamn cute.

01:33:23.973 --> 01:33:28.449
How do you think he'd feel if he
knew this whole thing was a fake?

01:33:29.312 --> 01:33:30.829
A fake?

01:33:31.314 --> 01:33:32.648
Sure.

01:33:32.649 --> 01:33:35.484
Hemlock's friend? That Wormwood?

01:33:35.485 --> 01:33:37.653
He was supposed to get killed.

01:33:37.654 --> 01:33:40.503
That's why we hired
the drunken bum.

01:33:41.199 --> 01:33:43.742
But what about the germ formula?

01:33:43.743 --> 01:33:45.744
I mean, the other side got it.

01:33:45.745 --> 01:33:48.122
That's the real cute part.

01:33:48.123 --> 01:33:49.873
They were supposed to get it.

01:33:49.874 --> 01:33:52.302
It's a phony.

01:33:53.628 --> 01:33:55.546
So why the sanctions?

01:33:55.547 --> 01:33:57.005
Well, that's simple.

01:33:57.006 --> 01:33:58.257
To sell the other side

01:33:58.258 --> 01:34:00.467
that the formula's the real thing.

01:34:00.468 --> 01:34:02.511
Now, if we just let 'em steal it

01:34:02.512 --> 01:34:05.806
and not do anything about it,
well, they'd get suspicious.

01:34:05.807 --> 01:34:10.487
So, we had to assign Hemlock
to sanction the assassins.

01:34:12.313 --> 01:34:15.566
Do you mean to tell me that
you're sitting up here safe,

01:34:15.567 --> 01:34:17.484
and that Jonathan might be killed?

01:34:17.485 --> 01:34:19.236
And for nothing?

01:34:19.237 --> 01:34:22.656
Honey, don't get worried. There's
still lots of men around here.

01:34:22.657 --> 01:34:25.005
Present company excluded.

01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:30.205
Jonathan told me that you people
were no better than animals,

01:34:30.206 --> 01:34:32.929
and I should've listened to him.

01:36:07.929 --> 01:36:10.448
Don't be late coming up.

01:36:15.019 --> 01:36:17.813
We're in the clear, Herr Doctor.

01:36:17.814 --> 01:36:18.981
So far so good.

01:36:18.982 --> 01:36:21.250
I knew it would be.

01:36:22.068 --> 01:36:23.665
Take it.

01:36:40.336 --> 01:36:42.809
You want to untie that?

01:36:45.591 --> 01:36:47.134
Karl really likes
to lead, doesn't he?

01:36:47.135 --> 01:36:48.677
Uh-huh.

01:36:48.678 --> 01:36:51.805
Even more, he likes
the title of leader.

01:36:51.806 --> 01:36:54.404
As if that makes him a leader.

01:36:54.892 --> 01:36:58.687
Tell me, Andrei, you ever spend
much time around Zurich?

01:36:58.688 --> 01:37:02.993
There are no mountains
there worth climbing.

01:37:11.534 --> 01:37:15.464
They can see us pretty well from the
hotel today. It's nice and clear.

01:37:15.955 --> 01:37:19.416
I suppose so. We must give
them a good show, Jonathan.

01:37:19.417 --> 01:37:21.418
Chocolate?

01:37:21.419 --> 01:37:23.266
Thanks.

01:37:24.047 --> 01:37:27.799
Jean-Paul doesn't look well.
Something is on his mind.

01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:29.693
Maybe.

01:37:30.678 --> 01:37:34.858
Resting already, Herr Doctor?
Come on, let's get moving.

01:39:05.106 --> 01:39:07.566
You don't like me,
Herr Doctor, do you?

01:39:07.567 --> 01:39:11.041
I don't dislike you.
I just think you're stupid.

01:39:11.529 --> 01:39:13.238
You knew we were
going on this climb

01:39:13.239 --> 01:39:16.658
and still you got involved
with Montaigne's wife.

01:39:16.659 --> 01:39:17.993
She told you?

01:39:17.994 --> 01:39:20.467
She didn't have to tell me.

01:39:21.247 --> 01:39:25.222
The climb's gonna be hard
enough without any intrigue.

01:39:26.961 --> 01:39:28.888
All right.

01:39:46.105 --> 01:39:48.533
What the hell are you doing?

01:39:49.859 --> 01:39:53.333
I couldn't sleep.
I'm checking the ropes.

01:39:53.696 --> 01:39:57.717
There was a frayed end on your
rope, and I'm cutting it out.

01:40:43.746 --> 01:40:48.176
Looks like we have some wet
work ahead of us, huh, Freytag?

01:40:51.837 --> 01:40:54.089
Surely, Herr Doctor,

01:40:54.090 --> 01:40:56.925
you have no objection
to a morning shower.

01:40:56.926 --> 01:40:59.511
This would be a hell of lot
easier in the wintertime.

01:40:59.512 --> 01:41:01.906
You suggest we wait?

01:41:15.570 --> 01:41:18.339
Way to move your jaws, Jon.

01:41:19.448 --> 01:41:21.967
That thing's gotta be a bitch.

01:41:27.248 --> 01:41:29.624
That's gotta be a bitch.

01:41:29.625 --> 01:41:32.599
I say, old boy,
are you using your scope?

01:41:33.504 --> 01:41:35.297
Do you mind if my wife has a peek?

01:41:35.298 --> 01:41:36.381
Darling, tell him
you'll pay for it.

01:41:36.382 --> 01:41:38.049
We can pay for it, you know.

01:41:38.050 --> 01:41:41.052
Get out of here. Either of you frigging
vampires ever touch this telescope,

01:41:41.053 --> 01:41:43.305
you're gonna need surgery
to get it out of your ass.

01:41:43.306 --> 01:41:45.140
Damn rude fellow.

01:41:45.141 --> 01:41:47.443
Bloody American farmers, you know.

01:42:58.005 --> 01:42:59.978
- Rocks!
- Huh?

01:43:10.434 --> 01:43:12.236
Jesus!

01:43:21.153 --> 01:43:24.002
Freytag! Meyer!

01:43:30.913 --> 01:43:32.806
Jesus Christ!

01:43:32.998 --> 01:43:34.675
Goddamn!

01:44:48.783 --> 01:44:50.801
Oh, God.

01:44:54.955 --> 01:44:56.539
You all right?

01:44:56.540 --> 01:45:00.595
I'm all right. I'm all right.

01:45:01.420 --> 01:45:03.063
Oh, thank God.

01:45:04.215 --> 01:45:08.343
Thanks. Where's Freytag?

01:45:08.344 --> 01:45:10.646
He felt he wasn't needed.

01:45:13.474 --> 01:45:15.850
Thought he wasn't needed?

01:45:15.851 --> 01:45:19.479
Freytag, you asshole!

01:45:26.946 --> 01:45:29.030
Tell me, Mr. Bowman,
in your opinion,

01:45:29.031 --> 01:45:31.324
do these men climb to prove
their manhood or is it

01:45:31.325 --> 01:45:35.095
more a matter of compensating
for inferiority feelings?

01:45:36.539 --> 01:45:39.999
Lady, why don't you go
get yourself screwed?

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.473
It'll do you a lot of good.

01:45:46.173 --> 01:45:49.592
Well, the worst is behind us.

01:45:49.593 --> 01:45:52.095
You really needn't be
so glum, Herr Doctor.

01:45:52.096 --> 01:45:54.722
If we have to retreat, we're never gonna
make it back through those falls.

01:45:54.723 --> 01:45:59.102
You have a defeatist mentality. We
won't retreat. We'll go straight on up.

01:45:59.103 --> 01:46:01.229
You didn't know we were in trouble?

01:46:01.230 --> 01:46:02.981
No.

01:46:02.982 --> 01:46:04.649
That's not good.

01:46:04.650 --> 01:46:07.819
Oh, it sounds exciting.
Pity I slept through it.

01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:10.714
That's the spirit.
Come on, up we go.

01:47:11.467 --> 01:47:13.644
Shit!

01:47:15.679 --> 01:47:17.847
- What is it?
- It's a foehn moving in.

01:47:17.848 --> 01:47:19.182
What's a foehn?

01:47:19.183 --> 01:47:22.143
Warm air, then rain, then a
freeze, like all in a flash.

01:47:22.144 --> 01:47:23.728
Is that bad?

01:47:23.729 --> 01:47:26.564
It's frigging awful. That entire mother
of a rock is gonna be covered with ice.

01:47:26.565 --> 01:47:30.276
But you can't walk on it,
and you can't see through it

01:47:30.277 --> 01:47:32.320
to find a crack in the rocks
to drive your pitons.

01:47:32.321 --> 01:47:34.572
The snow is all glazed over.

01:47:34.573 --> 01:47:38.798
But you'll be able to drop through
up to your neck at any time.

01:47:39.495 --> 01:47:42.674
Worse thing, it's
coming from the south.

01:47:43.499 --> 01:47:46.177
They won't even know
it's coming until it hits.

01:47:47.586 --> 01:47:49.754
Then they must come down.

01:47:49.755 --> 01:47:52.090
Lady, by the time they find out,
they won't be able to come down.

01:47:52.091 --> 01:47:55.691
They won't be able to go up.
They're just gonna be stuck.

01:50:55.065 --> 01:50:56.941
You all right?

01:50:56.942 --> 01:50:59.290
Yes, let's rest.

01:51:54.750 --> 01:51:56.552
Morning.

01:51:58.253 --> 01:51:59.795
How's Jean-Paul?

01:51:59.796 --> 01:52:01.598
He's dead.

01:52:03.091 --> 01:52:05.176
He must have gone during the storm.

01:52:05.177 --> 01:52:06.510
Drink that.

01:52:06.511 --> 01:52:08.596
How do you know he's dead?

01:52:08.597 --> 01:52:11.015
I looked at him.

01:52:11.016 --> 01:52:14.268
You saw he was dead, and
then you made a pot of tea?

01:52:14.269 --> 01:52:16.742
Drink it before it gets cold.

01:52:17.439 --> 01:52:19.440
He had a concussion.

01:52:19.441 --> 01:52:21.525
The storm was too much.

01:52:21.526 --> 01:52:25.581
The man inside couldn't keep
the man outside from dying.

01:52:28.283 --> 01:52:29.880
What now?

01:52:31.954 --> 01:52:35.373
Moving ahead is out of the question.
Conditions are impossible.

01:52:35.374 --> 01:52:37.927
We're gonna have to go back.

01:52:38.460 --> 01:52:39.794
Through the ravine?

01:52:39.795 --> 01:52:42.672
No, the ravine's impossible, too.

01:52:42.673 --> 01:52:44.799
- Andrei, you listening?
- Yeah.

01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:46.717
Speak up if you disagree.

01:52:46.718 --> 01:52:49.136
You're doing fine.

01:52:49.137 --> 01:52:50.846
All right.

01:52:50.847 --> 01:52:53.182
We traverse back
across the ice field

01:52:53.183 --> 01:52:57.645
to a place approximately above
the rail road tunnel window.

01:52:57.646 --> 01:53:00.481
There, if we can get a rope down,
Ben will be waiting with help.

01:53:00.482 --> 01:53:03.484
I'll lead. Karl, you be second.

01:53:03.485 --> 01:53:05.361
Meyer, you bring up the rear.

01:53:05.362 --> 01:53:09.156
We'll string Jean-Paul's body
on a separate line between us.

01:53:09.157 --> 01:53:11.492
We gonna carry Montaigne back down?

01:53:11.493 --> 01:53:14.467
A climber always
brings home his dead.

01:53:15.622 --> 01:53:17.094
We'll get down.

01:53:26.341 --> 01:53:28.676
- Mr. Bowman?
- Just go away.

01:53:28.677 --> 01:53:30.177
Oh, you're Jon's friend,
aren't you?

01:53:30.178 --> 01:53:32.555
Yeah. How is he?

01:53:32.556 --> 01:53:36.183
Uh, well, they're coming down.

01:53:36.184 --> 01:53:39.186
Shit, I don't know. Montaigne
is hurt or he's dead.

01:53:39.187 --> 01:53:41.188
Do you think they
can get down safely?

01:53:41.189 --> 01:53:44.525
There's only one chance.
Everything is iced.

01:53:44.526 --> 01:53:47.194
If they can get to those cliffs
above the station window,

01:53:47.195 --> 01:53:50.669
maybe they can rope down
and we can pull them in.

01:53:51.867 --> 01:53:53.576
How much of a chance
do you think they have?

01:53:53.577 --> 01:53:55.536
Not much, but it's the only one.

01:53:55.537 --> 01:53:57.121
As soon as I find out that
that's what they're doing,

01:53:57.122 --> 01:53:58.748
I'll bring men up to the station.

01:53:58.749 --> 01:54:01.917
You know, I didn't want
him to make this climb.

01:54:01.918 --> 01:54:06.268
And now, Montaigne is either hurt or
he's dead. I knew there'd be death.

01:54:06.715 --> 01:54:10.690
It was planned that way.
All for nothing.

01:55:44.271 --> 01:55:47.575
Drop your packs. We'll rig
some safety lines up.

01:56:01.371 --> 01:56:04.290
Jesus Christ.

01:56:04.291 --> 01:56:08.312
Yeah, but think of what it must
be like up there for them.

01:57:07.145 --> 01:57:10.198
Come on, Jon.
Get your ass off that hill.

01:57:24.246 --> 01:57:25.923
Jonathan!

01:57:34.839 --> 01:57:37.733
Damn it! Belay me.

01:57:43.890 --> 01:57:45.908
Hang on.

01:57:55.569 --> 01:57:58.292
Jonathan, watch it!

01:58:00.657 --> 01:58:04.882
Hang on. We should be
over the tunnel window.

01:58:29.811 --> 01:58:32.896
In the future, I wish
you would not use me

01:58:32.897 --> 01:58:35.899
to ride around on like a sled.

01:58:35.900 --> 01:58:40.404
Look, you better get up there before
he panics. Those pins are loose.

01:58:40.405 --> 01:58:42.489
Jonathan, you're very good.

01:58:42.490 --> 01:58:44.783
I have really enjoyed
climbing with you.

01:58:44.784 --> 01:58:46.952
We'll make it.

01:58:46.953 --> 01:58:48.787
I don't think so.

01:58:48.788 --> 01:58:51.466
But we shall continue with style.

01:58:58.715 --> 01:59:00.424
Take it easy.

01:59:00.425 --> 01:59:02.968
Take it easy. Don't panic.

01:59:02.969 --> 01:59:04.646
Wait.

01:59:15.732 --> 01:59:17.830
Look out!

01:59:18.443 --> 01:59:21.362
I can't hold him!
The ice is cracking!

02:00:16.835 --> 02:00:18.127
Jon!

02:00:18.128 --> 02:00:19.805
You're limping, Ben.

02:00:20.839 --> 02:00:22.732
I'm gonna throw you a rope.

02:00:23.425 --> 02:00:25.398
You're limping, Ben.

02:00:26.386 --> 02:00:28.095
Listen to me.

02:00:28.096 --> 02:00:30.569
I'm gonna throw you a rope, Jon.

02:00:34.477 --> 02:00:38.077
Catch this rope when
I throw it to you.

02:00:49.451 --> 02:00:52.721
Wrap it around you.
Wrap the rope around you.

02:00:55.623 --> 02:00:57.641
Hook the rope to you!

02:01:08.928 --> 02:01:10.480
Good!

02:01:12.891 --> 02:01:14.943
Now cut the rope above you.

02:01:20.148 --> 02:01:25.420
Jon, do what I tell you.
Cut the rope above you.

02:01:32.994 --> 02:01:35.843
Cut the rope above you, Jon.

02:02:51.197 --> 02:02:54.376
Cold mountain air really
bothers the old frostbite.

02:02:55.076 --> 02:02:56.451
You ought to remember, Jon.

02:02:56.452 --> 02:02:59.346
You hauled me down off that
mountain when my feet froze.

02:03:08.715 --> 02:03:12.676
I'm the one you're after.

02:03:12.677 --> 02:03:15.429
I never planned for
Henri Baq to die.

02:03:15.430 --> 02:03:17.681
I was supposed to take him
out and buy him some drinks

02:03:17.682 --> 02:03:19.933
and con him out of the microfilm.

02:03:19.934 --> 02:03:22.987
I was as surprised as anybody
when Kruger killed him.

02:03:25.732 --> 02:03:28.535
How'd you get involved
with the other side anyway?

02:03:29.736 --> 02:03:32.334
Miles Mellough. I owed him.

02:03:33.114 --> 02:03:36.033
He helped get my
daughter off drugs.

02:03:36.034 --> 02:03:37.868
Daughter?

02:03:37.869 --> 02:03:39.921
George is my little girl.

02:03:47.462 --> 02:03:49.630
Took a chance coming up
on the mountain.

02:03:49.631 --> 02:03:52.059
You took a chance
when you cut that rope.

02:04:10.610 --> 02:04:13.195
Old pink eyes is back.

02:04:13.196 --> 02:04:14.622
Jesus.

02:04:15.949 --> 02:04:17.115
Yeah?

02:04:17.116 --> 02:04:19.368
Hemlock, we don't know

02:04:19.369 --> 02:04:22.120
and we don't want to know
how you managed

02:04:22.121 --> 02:04:26.221
to precipitate all three fellow
climbers from the mountain.

02:04:26.542 --> 02:04:30.128
We assume that, unable
to discover your target,

02:04:30.129 --> 02:04:32.839
you decided to take all three.

02:04:34.926 --> 02:04:37.570
Extravagant, but effective.

02:04:38.012 --> 02:04:41.156
And you have always been both.

02:04:42.266 --> 02:04:46.321
We regret that your file will
be placed in the inactive list.

02:04:47.021 --> 02:04:52.327
However, we hope that one day you may
work with our organization again.

02:04:53.486 --> 02:04:56.460
Good-b ye, Dr. Hemlock.

02:05:03.788 --> 02:05:06.136
Thank you, baby.

02:05:11.379 --> 02:05:14.339
Well, C-2 thinks
they've got their man.

02:05:14.340 --> 02:05:16.688
There's no reason to
persuade them otherwise.

02:05:19.345 --> 02:05:21.888
You wouldn't shit me,
would you, Jon?

02:05:21.889 --> 02:05:23.015
Hate to spend the rest of my life

02:05:23.016 --> 02:05:26.536
looking over my shoulder
for you, like Miles did.

02:05:26.978 --> 02:05:28.871
Forget it, Ben.

02:05:31.441 --> 02:05:33.209
Look...

02:05:36.362 --> 02:05:37.779
Yeah.

02:05:37.780 --> 02:05:39.823
Well, maybe someday

02:05:39.824 --> 02:05:41.592
we'll do some more
climbing together.

02:05:44.037 --> 02:05:45.589
Maybe.

02:06:07.351 --> 02:06:09.227
You know what I don't have, baby?

02:06:09.228 --> 02:06:10.687
What don't you have?

02:06:10.688 --> 02:06:12.939
I don't have a ticket back home.

02:06:12.940 --> 02:06:14.742
I'll take care of it.

02:06:15.777 --> 02:06:18.028
That art collection of mine is
not going to get any bigger,

02:06:18.029 --> 02:06:21.615
but I'd sure like to have
you take a long look at it.

02:06:21.616 --> 02:06:25.261
I thought you'd never ask.
I'll get two tickets.

02:06:28.539 --> 02:06:30.056
Jonathan,

02:06:30.541 --> 02:06:32.093
you can tell me.

02:06:33.753 --> 02:06:36.852
You didn't really sanction
all three of them, did you?
