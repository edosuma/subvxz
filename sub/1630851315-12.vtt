WEBVTT

00:09.052 --> 00:12.012
The antenna deployment test
was supposed

00:12.055 --> 00:13.535
to be last week.

00:13.578 --> 00:15.058
You said "no."
We switched everything

00:15.102 --> 00:16.581
to Wednesday
at a huge cost.

00:17.626 --> 00:19.845
We're weeks behind schedule.

00:19.889 --> 00:21.021
Then maybe
we'll reschedule the launch.

00:21.064 --> 00:22.718
You know
DoD is breathing down our necks.

00:22.761 --> 00:24.763
You were supposed
to be a buffer.

00:24.807 --> 00:27.288
Now it feels like
you want us to fail.

00:27.331 --> 00:28.289
Joseph, what's wrong?

00:28.332 --> 00:29.507
Are you all right?
Joseph? Joseph?!

00:29.551 --> 00:32.206
Oh, my God.
Oh, Joseph. Joseph?

00:32.249 --> 00:34.208
Call 911! Now!

00:34.251 --> 00:35.992
Joseph? Joseph?

00:48.091 --> 00:49.962
And I'm like,
"We have been standing

00:50.006 --> 00:51.225
"in this line
for 20 minutes.

00:51.268 --> 00:53.053
How can you not know
what you want to order?!"

00:53.096 --> 00:54.445
You told her that, huh?

00:54.489 --> 00:56.360
Mm-hmm. It was
my civic duty.

00:56.404 --> 00:59.059
Keeping little old ladies
in check at the coffee shop.

00:59.102 --> 01:01.800
Well, she was old enough
to know better.

01:03.019 --> 01:04.368
Everything okay
there, Luce?

01:04.412 --> 01:05.935
Mm-hmm, yeah, totally.

01:05.978 --> 01:08.503
Uh, you just seem a
little on edge recently.

01:08.546 --> 01:10.548
Something happen?

01:11.810 --> 01:14.552
The way you ask is like
you already know.

01:15.945 --> 01:19.818
Maybe it's not my place, but
there's a certain DIA officer

01:19.862 --> 01:22.473
who I haven't seen
around your desk recently.

01:22.517 --> 01:24.388
You're right.
It's not your place.

01:24.432 --> 01:25.998
Fair.

01:27.261 --> 01:30.916
Sorry. That came out
harsher than I meant.

01:30.960 --> 01:35.182
Whatever <i>it</i> was,
isn't anymore,

01:35.225 --> 01:37.836
and it's for the best.

01:37.880 --> 01:41.013
Sure. Well, either way,
I'm sorry, Luce.

01:43.190 --> 01:46.802
Well, let's go see about
our dead Navy officer.

01:46.845 --> 01:48.325
Any indication

01:48.369 --> 01:50.980
Lieutenant Commander Cheng
was ill recently?

01:51.023 --> 01:52.982
I mean, it was obvious
something was off,

01:53.025 --> 01:55.202
but he-he didn't seem sick.

01:55.245 --> 01:57.117
How was he off?

01:57.160 --> 01:58.814
He just wasn't himself.

01:58.857 --> 02:02.470
Joseph was
always dependable.

02:02.513 --> 02:06.126
Last couple of weeks, though,
he barely spoke to anyone.

02:06.169 --> 02:08.302
You know, he wasn't
finishing tasks on time.

02:08.345 --> 02:11.087
- And that was unusual?
- Totally.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.089
He said nothing was wrong,
so I just assumed

02:13.133 --> 02:14.960
he didn't want to talk about it.

02:16.005 --> 02:17.615
Okay.

02:17.659 --> 02:19.313
We'll need to talk
to the rest of your team.

02:19.356 --> 02:21.271
If you just, uh,
give me a minute.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.536
HFD's taking
this seriously.

02:25.580 --> 02:28.148
'Cause we don't know exactly
what we're dealing with yet.

02:28.191 --> 02:31.063
Victim's Lieutenant Commander
Joseph Cheng, an engineer.

02:31.107 --> 02:33.065
Sudden onset of seizures
and signs

02:33.109 --> 02:35.372
of possible exposure
to a toxic substance.

02:35.416 --> 02:36.939
Anyone else
in the lab affected?

02:36.982 --> 02:38.941
Not so far.
Whatever's going on,

02:38.984 --> 02:40.769
it seems to be specific
to Cheng.

02:40.812 --> 02:42.814
Body's already at AFMES.

02:42.858 --> 02:44.686
They're building
a satellite?

02:44.729 --> 02:47.297
It's a joint project between
the Office of Naval Research

02:47.341 --> 02:48.864
and the university.

02:48.907 --> 02:51.171
It's, uh, some sort
of sophisticated technology

02:51.214 --> 02:53.173
to map rising sea levels.

02:53.216 --> 02:54.870
That's why I bought
in the hills, dude.

02:54.913 --> 02:57.786
If this project's about climate
change, why is it classified?

02:57.829 --> 03:00.092
Evidently, the tech has
military applications.

03:00.136 --> 03:02.399
Joseph Cheng may
have been targeted?

03:02.443 --> 03:05.054
That's what we need to find out.

03:11.147 --> 03:14.498
I'm thinking that would
work better as a pendant.

03:14.542 --> 03:16.457
This is for balancing the Ajna.

03:16.500 --> 03:17.893
The third eye.

03:17.936 --> 03:19.677
- Wisdom, right?
- And intuition.

03:19.721 --> 03:21.723
Both important
in our line of work.

03:21.766 --> 03:23.768
My second first husband
taught me that.

03:23.812 --> 03:25.683
How many first husbands
have you had, Commander?

03:25.727 --> 03:28.077
Three. So far.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.558
I consider every relationship
a new beginning.

03:30.601 --> 03:32.951
Your text said it was important.

03:32.995 --> 03:34.475
I'm afraid
you're not going to like it.

03:34.518 --> 03:37.521
Joseph Cheng was most
definitely poisoned.

03:37.565 --> 03:39.523
Blood tests confirmed
he'd ingested

03:39.567 --> 03:41.482
a massive amount
of thallium.

03:42.526 --> 03:44.398
Thallium?
Mm.

03:45.486 --> 03:47.923
The KGB used that
to assassinate defectors.

03:47.966 --> 03:51.056
It was a favorite of Saddam
Hussein's secret police, too.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.536
- I thought it was outlawed.
- Pure thallium

03:52.580 --> 03:54.886
hasn't been available
in the U.S. for decades.

03:54.930 --> 03:57.889
Occasionally, we see it as
a by-product from manufacturing.

03:57.933 --> 03:59.413
The semiconductor industry
mostly.

03:59.456 --> 04:00.588
Oh, and it's still used

04:00.631 --> 04:02.633
in rat poison
in Russia and China.

04:02.677 --> 04:05.245
Completely odorless
and tasteless.

04:05.288 --> 04:08.378
Poor Joseph probably never
realized he'd been poisoned.

04:08.422 --> 04:10.424
How long would it have taken
to kill him?

04:10.467 --> 04:13.470
Based on the level of toxic
hepatitis in the liver,

04:13.514 --> 04:16.560
I'd estimate ingestion at eight
to ten hours prior to death.

04:16.604 --> 04:19.302
- Any chance this was an accident?
- Environmental exposure

04:19.346 --> 04:22.479
to thallium wouldn't have
killed him this quickly.

04:22.523 --> 04:24.786
This was no accident.

04:28.050 --> 04:30.879
- Morning, boss.
- Morning.

04:30.922 --> 04:32.663
Chase said our
victim was poisoned

04:32.707 --> 04:34.665
eight to ten hours
before he died.

04:34.709 --> 04:36.972
Well, we just heard from HPD
that Hazmat found no trace

04:37.015 --> 04:38.887
of thallium at the lab
or Cheng's apartment.

04:38.930 --> 04:40.671
We need to find out
where he was poisoned.

04:40.715 --> 04:43.283
I'll pull credit cards,
cell records, make a timeline.

04:43.326 --> 04:44.980
What do we know
about Joseph Cheng?

04:45.023 --> 04:47.678
He was an American immigrant
success story.

04:47.722 --> 04:50.333
Cheng and his family moved here
from China when he was ten.

04:50.377 --> 04:52.204
He became a citizen at 16,

04:52.248 --> 04:54.729
ended up graduating
from the Naval Academy.

04:54.772 --> 04:56.296
He got his masters
in computer engineering

04:56.339 --> 04:57.862
from the Naval
Postgraduate School.

04:57.906 --> 05:00.300
His specialty was satellite
communications systems.

05:00.343 --> 05:02.345
That's why
he was on the UH project.

05:02.389 --> 05:03.868
We have any reason to believe

05:03.912 --> 05:05.653
that somebody would want
to stop this project?

05:05.696 --> 05:07.132
Nothing we've found so far.

05:07.176 --> 05:09.221
It's funded
by the Department of Defense,

05:09.265 --> 05:10.919
but the focus is
on climate change.

05:10.962 --> 05:13.617
DoD involvement,
the use of thallium--

05:13.661 --> 05:16.446
this feels like espionage.
Keep digging.

05:25.629 --> 05:27.675
- What's going on, Ernie?
- I got a fish on the line,

05:27.718 --> 05:30.417
- but I need help to reel 'em in.
- How big a fish?

05:30.460 --> 05:32.767
Not sure.
Maybe a grouper or snapper.

05:32.810 --> 05:34.595
Maybe bigger, though,
like a blue marlin or...

05:34.638 --> 05:37.162
- You get the point.
- Is that Joseph Cheng's phone?

05:37.206 --> 05:39.991
Yeah, I was searching his emails
when a message popped up.

05:42.080 --> 05:44.169
- Who's it from?
- No idea.

05:44.213 --> 05:46.520
So I started communicating,
but it was all in Chinese.

05:46.563 --> 05:48.783
And I'm not as conversational
as I thought I was.

05:48.826 --> 05:51.176
- They think you're Joseph Cheng?
- Yeah.

05:51.220 --> 05:52.700
And they're communicating
through an app

05:52.743 --> 05:54.310
with sophisticated encryption.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.617
Messages self-destruct
as soon as they're read.

06:00.185 --> 06:01.404
"Can you meet?"

06:01.448 --> 06:02.927
Whoever it is
is here in Hawai'i.

06:02.971 --> 06:05.147
And they obviously don't know
Cheng is dead.

06:05.190 --> 06:06.888
So it's not the killer.

06:06.931 --> 06:09.238
But they might have information
on who is. Agree to meet.

06:10.326 --> 06:12.110
Whoever Joseph Cheng
was communicating with,

06:12.154 --> 06:14.374
they're going to a lot
of trouble to keep it secret.

06:15.592 --> 06:17.202
"Zoo. 4:00 p.m.

06:17.246 --> 06:19.248
I'll be in touch."
Nice job.

06:20.292 --> 06:22.294
But they're expecting
to meet Joseph Cheng.

06:22.338 --> 06:23.861
So,

06:23.905 --> 06:25.428
how many are we up against?

06:25.472 --> 06:28.431
Is this like
a terrorist organization?

06:28.475 --> 06:30.651
- Do I need a weapon?
- All right, slow your roll, Alan.

06:30.694 --> 06:32.000
You're still in
field training.

06:32.043 --> 06:34.263
This is just a decoy
operation, all right?

06:34.306 --> 06:36.004
Just pretend

06:36.047 --> 06:38.006
to be Joseph Cheng
and make contact.

06:38.049 --> 06:40.182
- We handle the rest.
- Right.

06:40.225 --> 06:44.360
Got it. Just Cheng,
decoy, make contact.

06:47.015 --> 06:49.496
This is crazy.
I can't wait to tell the guys.

06:49.539 --> 06:50.975
You're not telling
anyone, dude.

06:51.019 --> 06:53.674
This is a <i>secret</i>
decoy operation.

06:53.717 --> 06:56.328
A secret. Right.
That makes sense, yeah.

06:56.372 --> 06:57.895
Ah, uh...

06:57.939 --> 07:00.420
Uh...

07:00.463 --> 07:03.031
Are we sure this
is a good idea?

07:04.380 --> 07:06.164
He'll be fine.

07:06.208 --> 07:08.166
Remember how amped you were
your first field op?

07:08.210 --> 07:09.907
I was totally chill.

07:09.951 --> 07:11.474
You tackled the guy
we were tailing.

07:11.518 --> 07:12.910
Yeah, because he ran.

07:12.954 --> 07:14.999
Lucy, he was jogging.
Hey.

07:15.043 --> 07:16.827
It's almost 4:00.
Let's get inside.

07:17.915 --> 07:20.396
Someone is supposed to
text you where to meet.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.659
Your Chinese is
solid, right?

07:25.096 --> 07:27.664
All right. Let's do this.

07:40.285 --> 07:41.809
Take it easy.

07:41.852 --> 07:42.897
You look nervous.

07:42.940 --> 07:44.159
Not really a...

07:44.202 --> 07:45.813
zoo fan, to be honest.

07:47.249 --> 07:48.772
Still no communication.

07:48.816 --> 07:50.252
Think they bailed?

07:50.295 --> 07:52.080
Or they're just being careful.

07:52.123 --> 07:54.952
Hey, I got something.

07:54.996 --> 07:56.432
Hey, keep your head down, Alan.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.564
And stop

07:57.607 --> 07:58.869
touching your ear when we talk.

08:01.002 --> 08:02.699
What's the text say?

08:02.743 --> 08:05.310
Wants me to meet
by the cheetahs.

08:05.354 --> 08:07.617
The path to your right
through the trees.

08:07.661 --> 08:09.619
I'll swing around.
Copy.

08:09.663 --> 08:11.969
You're doing great, Alan.
Be cool.

08:12.013 --> 08:15.016
Oh, I'm cool... like an igloo.

08:15.059 --> 08:17.366
Except an igloo's kind of cold.
I-I'm more

08:17.409 --> 08:20.325
jazz musician... cool.

08:29.813 --> 08:31.902
- Oh.
- Are you alone, friend?

08:31.946 --> 08:33.730
Oh, geez.
Don't shoot me, please.

08:33.774 --> 08:35.471
Depends. Who the
hell are you?

08:35.515 --> 08:37.691
Think the better question
is, who the hell are you?

08:56.187 --> 08:57.537
David Sola, who works

08:57.580 --> 08:59.277
for the New Zealand Office
of Business Development.

08:59.321 --> 09:00.627
Which, of course,
is a cover.

09:00.670 --> 09:03.194
- You're a spy.
- Case officer, actually.

09:03.238 --> 09:07.547
With the New Zealand Security
Intelligence Service.

09:07.590 --> 09:08.548
I already spoke
to your supervisor.

09:08.591 --> 09:10.593
Lydia? Yeah, she's a good woman.

09:10.637 --> 09:13.074
She was surprised
- to find out you were here.
- Makes sense.

09:13.117 --> 09:14.902
I may have neglected
to tell her.

09:14.945 --> 09:17.252
Have a seat, Mr. Sola.

09:17.295 --> 09:19.515
Ah, no, thanks.
Don't plan on staying long.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.082
Oh, with an attitude like that,

09:21.125 --> 09:23.911
you might be staying here
a lot longer than you'd like.

09:23.954 --> 09:25.826
All right.

09:25.869 --> 09:27.479
Let's not argue, okay?

09:27.523 --> 09:28.872
We're all allies here, right?

09:28.916 --> 09:30.265
Friends. Hmm?

09:30.308 --> 09:32.136
Friends don't sneak
into each other's countries.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.922
Friends also don't
threaten federal agents.

09:34.965 --> 09:37.402
I'm not sure my cell phone could
have done much damage, bro.

09:37.446 --> 09:39.317
Our trainee was traumatized.

09:39.361 --> 09:41.189
Well, then,
let me apologize to him.

09:41.232 --> 09:43.321
Okay? I promise you,
I mean you no harm.

09:43.365 --> 09:45.149
We don't know anything
about you.

09:45.193 --> 09:47.891
Really? I know a lot
about you guys.

09:47.935 --> 09:49.414
I did a little digging
on my way over.

09:49.458 --> 09:50.764
Jane Tennant.

09:50.807 --> 09:53.157
First female SAC
at NCIS Pearl Harbor.

09:53.201 --> 09:55.507
Congratulations, by the way.
Jesse.

09:55.551 --> 09:57.466
Former DC Homicide.

09:57.509 --> 09:59.381
Couple of write-ups
for insubordination.

09:59.424 --> 10:01.775
I bet those stories
are pretty juicy, eh, brah?

10:01.818 --> 10:04.299
And the prodigal son returns.

10:04.342 --> 10:05.605
Former jarhead.

10:05.648 --> 10:07.171
That's the term, right? Jarhead?

10:07.215 --> 10:09.391
Someone's gonna need
to explain that one to me.

10:09.434 --> 10:12.133
You know a lot for a guy
who claims to mean us no harm.

10:12.176 --> 10:13.656
Case you were working on

10:13.700 --> 10:15.702
- has to do with Joseph Cheng?
- Mm-hmm.

10:15.745 --> 10:17.399
I had an asset.

10:17.442 --> 10:19.793
A Chinese satellite engineer
named May Wu.

10:19.836 --> 10:21.316
She lived in China

10:21.359 --> 10:22.796
but regularly traveled
to New Zealand,

10:22.839 --> 10:24.406
and she supplied me
with information.

10:24.449 --> 10:25.973
It was her phone
that I used to contact your guy.

10:26.016 --> 10:27.409
You said

10:27.452 --> 10:29.411
had a source.

10:30.499 --> 10:32.849
May was killed
in Shanghai last week.

10:32.893 --> 10:34.982
Supposedly a hit-and-run,
but she was targeted.

10:36.026 --> 10:37.637
That her?

10:39.116 --> 10:41.423
How'd you pull that up so fast?

10:41.466 --> 10:43.207
Recognized her surname
from our background.

10:43.251 --> 10:46.297
May Wu and Joseph Cheng
are cousins.

10:46.341 --> 10:48.386
Why do you think
she was murdered?

10:49.736 --> 10:51.651
She'd been threatened.

10:51.694 --> 10:53.304
Ordered to download software
that would

10:53.348 --> 10:56.307
create an undetectable back door
into one of our satellites.

10:56.351 --> 10:57.657
Who threatened her?

10:57.700 --> 10:59.006
Pretty sure it was MSS,

10:59.049 --> 11:00.616
Chinese intelligence,
but I have no proof.

11:02.313 --> 11:03.924
I promised May

11:03.967 --> 11:05.447
I'd get her out.

11:05.490 --> 11:07.057
I have extensive contacts
in China,

11:07.101 --> 11:09.712
but I just wasn't fast enough.

11:10.931 --> 11:12.759
Sorry. Can I talk to you?

11:13.934 --> 11:15.457
In private?

11:17.851 --> 11:19.896
Bring Sola up to speed.

11:19.940 --> 11:22.420
I'd expect the same in return.

11:24.771 --> 11:26.729
I was working
on a timeline

11:26.773 --> 11:28.775
of Cheng's movements
before he died.

11:28.818 --> 11:31.952
Pulled all the footage from
UH's security cameras.

11:31.995 --> 11:34.998
This is from the day
before he was killed.

11:38.132 --> 11:39.829
Maggie?

11:39.873 --> 11:42.049
They talk
for about 20 minutes.

11:42.092 --> 11:44.704
Your friend's a
professor at UH, right?

11:44.747 --> 11:46.096
Yeah. Yeah.

11:46.140 --> 11:48.446
That's a pretty intense
conversation

11:48.490 --> 11:49.752
from the look of it.

11:51.406 --> 11:53.103
What do you think
Cheng wanted?

11:55.845 --> 11:57.325
Janie.

11:57.368 --> 11:59.066
What a delightful surprise.

11:59.109 --> 12:01.808
Luckily, I just opened

12:01.851 --> 12:04.506
a really special rioja
that is just

12:04.549 --> 12:06.551
begging to be shared.

12:07.596 --> 12:09.380
I'm afraid
this isn't a social visit.

12:09.424 --> 12:11.339
Well, that sounds ominous.

12:11.382 --> 12:12.993
Luckily, ominous

12:13.036 --> 12:14.995
is best served with a good red.

12:17.432 --> 12:19.434
You know Joseph Cheng?

12:24.091 --> 12:26.702
Something has happened.

12:26.746 --> 12:27.964
You don't sound surprised.

12:28.008 --> 12:29.226
Just tell me, Janie.

12:33.361 --> 12:35.015
Cheng died this morning.

12:35.058 --> 12:36.973
Poisoned.

12:46.983 --> 12:48.593
Poor Joseph.

12:48.637 --> 12:50.247
What were you two discussing?

12:50.291 --> 12:52.597
He'd received
some anonymous emails.

12:52.641 --> 12:55.296
They included photos
of his mother's family

12:55.339 --> 12:58.778
in China and threats to kill
them if he didn't cooperate.

12:58.821 --> 13:00.649
- Cooperate how?
- I don't know.

13:00.692 --> 13:03.260
Something about his work.
Joseph didn't say.

13:03.304 --> 13:05.959
He didn't know whether

13:06.002 --> 13:07.525
the threat was even credible.

13:07.569 --> 13:09.876
- Why come to you?
- We met

13:09.919 --> 13:11.878
at a faculty function,

13:11.921 --> 13:13.880
we became friendly.

13:13.923 --> 13:16.143
He knew
that I was in intelligence.

13:16.186 --> 13:18.362
He thought
I could help him.

13:18.406 --> 13:21.148
He should've come directly
to NCIS.

13:21.191 --> 13:23.150
He was gonna file a report

13:23.193 --> 13:25.326
with you and with his CO today.

13:25.369 --> 13:27.807
He just wanted to make sure

13:27.850 --> 13:30.679
that he had his documentation
in hand.

13:30.722 --> 13:32.594
I really didn't

13:32.637 --> 13:34.857
think that he was
in imminent danger.

13:37.555 --> 13:39.731
Did you talk to anyone
at the agency?

13:39.775 --> 13:41.908
Chuck DeVries

13:41.951 --> 13:43.735
in Operations.

13:43.779 --> 13:45.737
You said poison?

13:45.781 --> 13:47.783
Is this MSS?

13:47.827 --> 13:50.351
- I don't know yet.
- I should've had them pull him in.

13:50.394 --> 13:52.005
I should have talked to you.

13:52.048 --> 13:53.397
Maggie, this is not your fault.

14:06.802 --> 14:08.412
Lucy?

14:09.457 --> 14:10.762
Oh, okay, you're still mad.

14:10.806 --> 14:12.373
- I get it.
- What gave you that idea?

14:12.416 --> 14:13.809
Well, you're practically
running away from me.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.071
Well, if you really got it,

14:15.115 --> 14:16.507
then you wouldn't be
trying to catch me.

14:16.551 --> 14:18.335
I'm not trying to.
Lucy, please just wait.

14:21.599 --> 14:23.863
I should've told you about Cara.

14:23.906 --> 14:25.429
I don't want to hear
what you should've done.

14:25.473 --> 14:28.084
You were not honest,
and that doesn't work for me.

14:28.128 --> 14:29.912
So that's it?

14:29.956 --> 14:32.523
You just throw away
whatever this was that easily?

14:32.567 --> 14:34.395
It is not easy.

14:35.613 --> 14:38.094
And you threw it away.

14:39.748 --> 14:42.272
Coffee's getting cold. Bye.

14:48.278 --> 14:50.672
- Can I be any clearer?
- I told you, I'm not following you.

14:50.715 --> 14:52.587
Tennant called me.

14:54.284 --> 14:56.852
Maggie Shaw has friends
in high places.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.985
- You talked to CIA?
- She told them about the threats

14:59.028 --> 15:00.421
made against Joseph Cheng.

15:00.464 --> 15:01.944
The assistant director
sent agents

15:01.988 --> 15:04.164
to talk to him,
but they were too late.

15:04.207 --> 15:05.992
The Chinese must have known
Cheng reached out.

15:06.035 --> 15:08.516
They poisoned him the day
after he asked Maggie for help.

15:08.559 --> 15:10.997
- And you're sure this is MSS?
- It's looking that way.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.564
There's strong connections
between this case

15:13.608 --> 15:16.263
and the murder of
an intelligence asset in China.

15:18.526 --> 15:20.310
New Zealand SIS?

15:20.354 --> 15:22.617
An Agent David Sola
brought it to us.

15:22.660 --> 15:24.706
I know Sola.

15:24.749 --> 15:25.968
By reputation anyway.

15:26.012 --> 15:27.361
Supposedly effective,

15:27.404 --> 15:29.058
but doesn't play well
with others.

15:29.102 --> 15:30.799
I can attest to that.

15:30.842 --> 15:32.844
He came to Hawai'i
with no authorization

15:32.888 --> 15:34.672
to track Joseph Cheng down.

15:34.716 --> 15:36.587
You send him back?

15:37.675 --> 15:40.722
Actually, I got State to sign
off on letting him help us.

15:40.765 --> 15:42.898
You think he knows more
than he's offering.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.814
He's convinced that both
of these killings are MSS.

15:45.857 --> 15:48.382
Took his asset's murder
personally.

15:48.425 --> 15:50.123
May drum up a new lead.

15:50.166 --> 15:51.776
I got Kai keeping an eye on him.

15:51.820 --> 15:53.648
Well, if Sola's right,
we have Chinese operatives

15:53.691 --> 15:56.129
here on American soil.
How do we find them?

15:56.172 --> 15:58.131
Well, we start by talking

15:58.174 --> 16:00.524
to the MSS agent
we already have in custody.

16:00.568 --> 16:03.049
- Myra Tan?
- Chinese spy

16:03.092 --> 16:05.312
arrested for conspiring
to kill a Navy pilot.

16:05.355 --> 16:08.097
Been in prison a few months,
maybe willing to deal.

16:08.141 --> 16:10.752
Not like the FBI
and intelligence haven't tried.

16:10.795 --> 16:12.493
She hasn't talked yet.

16:12.536 --> 16:14.408
She's probably too scared,
and for good reason,

16:14.451 --> 16:16.366
considering it happened
to Cheng and his cousin.

16:16.410 --> 16:18.542
Need to make it worth her while.

16:19.630 --> 16:21.632
I can contact FBI,
get you face time with her.

16:21.676 --> 16:22.938
Hopefully,

16:22.982 --> 16:24.984
you will have better luck
than they have.

16:31.599 --> 16:32.948
Hey, boss.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.036
What's our friend up to?

16:34.080 --> 16:35.429
Looks like he's taking

16:35.472 --> 16:37.692
a driving tour
of the entire island.

16:37.735 --> 16:39.781
Well, I may actually
have a use for him.

16:39.824 --> 16:42.044
Or at least for his supposed
Chinese contacts.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.393
Wouldn't count on much.

16:43.437 --> 16:45.569
Bring him in for me, okay?

16:45.613 --> 16:47.354
Actually pulling over now.

16:47.397 --> 16:49.617
At my dad's restaurant.

16:52.315 --> 16:53.577
What the...?

16:57.712 --> 16:59.931
I am a stranger

16:59.975 --> 17:01.324
in a strange land, Hina.

17:01.368 --> 17:04.545
- Any advice?
- Loco moco all the way, David.

17:04.588 --> 17:05.981
Go big or go home, right?

17:06.025 --> 17:07.287
A woman who doesn't hesitate.

17:07.330 --> 17:09.637
Bull runs deep with you, huh?

17:09.680 --> 17:11.160
And an excellent judge
of character.

17:11.204 --> 17:12.335
And kind of a
pain in the ass.

17:12.379 --> 17:13.684
Special Agent Holman.

17:13.728 --> 17:15.947
I like your dad's place.
Lot of local charm.

17:18.080 --> 17:19.386
I guess it's two loco mocos.

17:19.429 --> 17:21.301
I got it from here.

17:21.344 --> 17:22.911
You're trouble, I see.

17:22.954 --> 17:24.086
But I do

17:24.130 --> 17:26.436
love that accent.

17:29.787 --> 17:32.442
Oh, you worked up an appetite
following me so poorly today?

17:32.486 --> 17:33.791
This is my personal life.

17:33.835 --> 17:35.663
And you like to keep it separate
from work.

17:35.706 --> 17:36.751
So you know what I think?

17:36.794 --> 17:37.969
I don't really care
what you think.

17:38.013 --> 17:39.058
We're a lot alike.

17:39.101 --> 17:40.494
Doing our own thing.

17:40.537 --> 17:42.104
Not wanting to be tied down
or answer to anyone.

17:42.148 --> 17:43.453
Difference is,

17:43.497 --> 17:45.977
one of us should be
on a plane right now.

17:46.021 --> 17:48.589
What's the deal
with Hina, anyway?

17:48.632 --> 17:50.417
Felt a little bit of
heat there, didn't I?

17:50.460 --> 17:52.767
No. She's just being nice
to you.

17:52.810 --> 17:54.290
I was talking about you two.

17:56.423 --> 18:00.079
I thought you were here to catch
whoever killed your source.

18:00.122 --> 18:02.733
Yeah, but since I'm not
allowed to talk to anybody

18:02.777 --> 18:04.735
or do anything,
I figured I'd wait

18:04.779 --> 18:06.737
for NCIS to make
the first move.

18:06.781 --> 18:08.217
Isn't that why you're here?

18:13.179 --> 18:15.137
Tennant wants your help.

18:15.181 --> 18:16.791
But only

18:16.834 --> 18:19.010
if you can be a team player.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.973
This is our most
secure network.

18:25.016 --> 18:26.627
Part of the DISN.

18:26.670 --> 18:28.237
A dedicated
communication system

18:28.281 --> 18:30.239
with the highest level
encryption and security.

18:30.283 --> 18:32.415
Mm. Someone's
overcompensating.

18:32.459 --> 18:35.418
You'll be talking with one
of our most valuable detainees.

18:35.462 --> 18:36.941
Not so valuable.

18:36.985 --> 18:38.334
You've had her for months
and gotten nothing.

18:38.378 --> 18:39.814
David Sola,

18:39.857 --> 18:41.337
living up to your reputation.

18:41.381 --> 18:42.469
All good, I hope.

18:42.512 --> 18:43.905
Well, one can always hope.

18:43.948 --> 18:45.472
Why is he here again?

18:45.515 --> 18:47.213
He's the carrot
to our stick.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.174
Ms. Tan,

18:52.218 --> 18:53.436
thanks for agreeing to meet.

18:53.480 --> 18:54.959
Wasn't given a choice.

18:55.003 --> 18:57.527
I told them I'm not talking.

18:57.571 --> 18:59.529
It's okay. I'll do the talking.

18:59.573 --> 19:01.270
We need information
on the murder

19:01.314 --> 19:03.359
of a former Chinese citizen--
Joseph Cheng.

19:03.403 --> 19:06.362
And details
of MSS assets in Hawai'i.

19:06.406 --> 19:08.103
In return,

19:08.147 --> 19:10.149
you'll get this.

19:15.806 --> 19:17.678
Your sister's beautiful.

19:17.721 --> 19:19.549
You must worry about her.

19:19.593 --> 19:21.203
About what your MSS colleagues

19:21.247 --> 19:22.944
might do
if you cooperate with us.

19:22.987 --> 19:25.120
- So you're threatening her now?
- Not a threat.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.861
An opportunity.

19:26.904 --> 19:28.645
What if we can get her out
of China?

19:28.689 --> 19:32.562
You can't. She's being watched.

19:32.606 --> 19:34.695
I can't...

19:34.738 --> 19:36.479
but he can.

19:36.523 --> 19:38.307
Who are you?

19:38.351 --> 19:40.309
I'm your best chance
at a future.

19:40.353 --> 19:42.833
I have contacts in Nanjing
where your sister lives.

19:42.877 --> 19:44.966
We know how to move people.

19:45.009 --> 19:47.490
Your sister and her husband
will be thousands of miles away

19:47.534 --> 19:49.536
before MSS even knows
they're gone.

19:49.579 --> 19:52.234
If you make it worth our while.

19:54.628 --> 19:57.021
Operation Dark Moon.

19:58.284 --> 19:59.546
Need more than a name.

19:59.589 --> 20:01.591
Top secret MSS unit.

20:01.635 --> 20:02.940
They force Chinese nationals

20:02.984 --> 20:04.942
living abroad
to do their dirty work.

20:04.986 --> 20:07.206
Or their families
back in China pay the price.

20:08.685 --> 20:10.774
And that's all you get

20:10.818 --> 20:13.560
until I have confirmation
my sister's safe.

20:15.779 --> 20:17.259
Consider it done.

20:17.303 --> 20:19.609
No way he could pull this off.

20:19.653 --> 20:22.873
Getting her family out of China
will take weeks at best.

20:22.917 --> 20:25.006
Tell me you've got
something faster.

20:25.049 --> 20:26.529
I got something faster. Move.

20:29.489 --> 20:32.492
Myra said MSS forced
Chinese citizens living abroad

20:32.535 --> 20:34.798
to work for them,
which gave me an idea.

20:34.842 --> 20:37.018
These are all the places
Joseph Cheng visited

20:37.061 --> 20:39.020
during the time he was poisoned.

20:39.063 --> 20:41.979
I pulled employee records
looking for Chinese nationals.

20:42.023 --> 20:43.981
You think one of them
was coerced by the MSS?

20:44.025 --> 20:45.505
Yes.

20:45.548 --> 20:47.768
Harry Yen.

20:47.811 --> 20:49.770
Grad student from Shanghai.

20:49.813 --> 20:52.468
Works at a boba tea shop
Cheng went to almost every day.

20:52.512 --> 20:54.165
Harry Yen have family
in China?

20:54.209 --> 20:56.385
- Lots.
- Definitely worth checking out.

20:56.429 --> 20:58.039
Send me his info.

20:58.082 --> 21:00.215
I already did.

21:01.825 --> 21:05.046
According to his schedule, Yen
should just be finishing class.

21:05.089 --> 21:08.484
Yeah, looks like
class got out early. Excuse me.

21:08.528 --> 21:10.181
Mr. Yen?

21:10.225 --> 21:11.792
Federal agents!
Stop! Lucy!

21:21.758 --> 21:22.846
Let's go. Let's go.

21:44.738 --> 21:46.783
Look.
The intersection's jammed.

21:46.827 --> 21:48.307
They're stopping.
We've got 'em.

21:53.442 --> 21:54.574
They're coming back.

21:54.617 --> 21:56.140
Hold on.

22:07.891 --> 22:09.066
What the hell?

22:09.110 --> 22:10.677
I told you to hold on!

22:12.983 --> 22:15.159
Look out! Look out!

22:37.399 --> 22:38.574
How many suspects were involved
in Harry Yen's abduction?

22:38.618 --> 22:40.184
At least three--
two in the SUV, another one

22:40.228 --> 22:42.578
who moved the dump truck
to block us-- all in the wind.

22:42.622 --> 22:44.624
HPD found the SUV a couple miles
from the university.

22:44.667 --> 22:45.973
Wiped clean.

22:46.016 --> 22:47.670
Grabbing Yen like that means

22:47.714 --> 22:49.672
he's almost certainly the one
that slipped Cheng the poison.

22:49.716 --> 22:51.674
Probably coerced by MSS.

22:51.718 --> 22:54.416
Bold move, taking him
- in broad daylight.
- Or reckless.

22:54.460 --> 22:56.418
Joseph Cheng
contacting Maggie

22:56.462 --> 22:57.724
definitely spooked them.

22:57.767 --> 22:59.378
And they're tying
up loose ends,

22:59.421 --> 23:01.423
which is bad news
for Harry Yen.

23:03.338 --> 23:04.861
Any luck I.D.'ing
our suspects?

23:04.905 --> 23:06.733
Sorta, kinda, almost.

23:06.776 --> 23:09.300
Searched traffic cams and
security footage in the area.

23:09.344 --> 23:10.998
Found pieces.

23:11.041 --> 23:13.174
- Not great.
- Not by themselves.

23:13.217 --> 23:15.742
But I used a program to patch
the various pieces together.

23:15.785 --> 23:18.614
Sort of a digital collage.
And...

23:20.050 --> 23:21.356
Voilà.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.053
Three-man team.

23:23.097 --> 23:24.794
We got enough images
of the driver

23:24.838 --> 23:26.361
and the man who grabbed Yen

23:26.405 --> 23:28.450
to create
a pretty good likeness.

23:28.494 --> 23:30.452
Maybe if we wanted
a Picasso painting.

23:30.496 --> 23:31.714
A little faith, please.

23:35.501 --> 23:36.632
Good enough
for facial recognition?

23:36.676 --> 23:37.981
Already running them.

23:38.025 --> 23:39.766
Send it to Whistler
and David Sola, too.

23:39.809 --> 23:42.029
They might have more luck
with international databases.

23:42.072 --> 23:44.248
I'll show 'em to Maggie,
see if they ring any bells.

23:44.292 --> 23:46.425
You think that's likely?

23:46.468 --> 23:47.774
Been out of the game a while.

23:47.817 --> 23:49.558
This team knew their way
around the university,

23:49.602 --> 23:51.995
had Yen's schedule,
probably staked out the campus.

23:52.039 --> 23:55.216
And it gives you a reason
to go check on her.

23:56.565 --> 23:58.524
Two birds, one stone.

24:01.178 --> 24:02.876
You don't need
to hold my hand, Janie.

24:02.919 --> 24:05.487
I've been doing this
a lot longer than you have.

24:05.531 --> 24:07.620
I just came by
to ask for your help.

24:07.663 --> 24:09.709
I trained you to lie better
than that, didn't I?

24:09.752 --> 24:13.626
And... to check in with you.

24:13.669 --> 24:15.628
You didn't go
to work today.

24:15.671 --> 24:18.674
Yeah, I...

24:18.718 --> 24:20.894
I just couldn't.

24:20.937 --> 24:23.331
I don't know why
this is hitting me so hard.

24:23.374 --> 24:25.376
It's not like
I never lost an agent.

24:25.420 --> 24:27.378
Hell, I almost lost you once.

24:27.422 --> 24:29.032
But you saved my life.

24:29.076 --> 24:32.253
Don't you forget it.

24:33.297 --> 24:35.517
But Joseph Cheng
isn't your agent.

24:35.561 --> 24:37.214
Or responsibility.

24:37.258 --> 24:39.173
He became my responsibility
the minute

24:39.216 --> 24:40.740
that he reached out to me.

24:40.783 --> 24:43.394
And I let him down.

24:43.438 --> 24:45.527
I'm just off my game.

24:46.572 --> 24:48.008
If it helps,

24:48.051 --> 24:49.792
we think we might know
who poisoned him.

24:49.836 --> 24:52.621
MSS, I assume.
Did you make an arrest?

24:52.665 --> 24:54.928
Not yet.

24:55.929 --> 24:57.713
What is their angle here?

24:57.757 --> 25:00.716
We believe Joseph Cheng
was targeted

25:00.760 --> 25:04.024
by an operation
called Dark Moon.

25:05.765 --> 25:06.896
You ever heard of it?

25:06.940 --> 25:08.289
No.

25:08.332 --> 25:10.639
MSS uses families of Chinese
nationals as leverage.

25:10.683 --> 25:12.380
Hmm.

25:12.423 --> 25:14.774
Because people will do
anything for their family.

25:14.817 --> 25:16.689
That's clever.

25:18.778 --> 25:21.563
You haven't seen any of these
men on campus, have you?

25:21.607 --> 25:23.913
Oh, you really did want my help?

25:23.957 --> 25:26.220
- Always.
- Oh. Sure.

25:26.263 --> 25:28.004
Uh...

25:28.048 --> 25:30.050
No.

25:30.093 --> 25:31.312
Wait.

25:33.009 --> 25:34.924
This guy.

25:34.968 --> 25:36.578
You recognize him?

25:36.622 --> 25:38.406
Taipei, five years ago.

25:38.449 --> 25:40.147
A journalist went missing,

25:40.190 --> 25:42.236
and Chinese intelligence
was suspected.

25:42.279 --> 25:43.977
They brought me in to consult.

25:44.020 --> 25:45.631
You think he was involved?

25:45.674 --> 25:48.721
I can't be sure. I only saw a
really grainy photograph, but...

25:48.764 --> 25:50.026
I think this was the guy.

25:50.070 --> 25:51.593
- Got a name?
- As far as I know,

25:51.637 --> 25:54.901
they never uncovered
his true identity,

25:54.944 --> 25:58.687
but the Chinese referred
"Bao."

25:58.731 --> 26:01.168
- Bao?
- Yeah.

26:02.212 --> 26:04.606
See? You did help.

26:04.650 --> 26:06.303
Not much, I'm afraid.

26:06.347 --> 26:09.219
No one knows
if Bao really exists.

26:09.263 --> 26:11.439
And if he's part
of this Dark Moon,

26:11.482 --> 26:14.050
finding him is not
gonna be easy.

26:16.052 --> 26:18.011
Maggie's not wrong.

26:18.054 --> 26:20.753
Bao is the ghost story
spies tell each other at night.

26:20.796 --> 26:22.798
Any major Chinese
intelligence operation

26:22.842 --> 26:25.279
in the last ten years
is attributed to him.

26:25.322 --> 26:27.977
Security breach at NATO,
South Korean cyberattack,

26:28.021 --> 26:30.763
assassination of a Taiwanese
dissident in Madrid.

26:30.806 --> 26:32.765
He is very real.

26:32.808 --> 26:35.245
Last year, a Chinese national
in England was suspected

26:35.289 --> 26:37.160
of stealing
nuclear research.

26:37.204 --> 26:39.815
He died of a heart attack before
he could even be arrested.

26:39.859 --> 26:41.600
MI-6 thinks
it was murder.

26:41.643 --> 26:43.602
Same M.O. as Joseph Cheng

26:43.645 --> 26:45.604
and your source in China.

26:45.647 --> 26:47.214
If these are all Bao's work,

26:47.257 --> 26:48.650
he's been operating
mostly undetected

26:48.694 --> 26:49.999
and with top-tier intel.

26:50.043 --> 26:51.958
- No other clues to his identity?
- No.

26:52.001 --> 26:54.830
Nothing me and my colleagues
at the GCSB could find.

26:54.874 --> 26:58.573
Huh. Maybe you're not quite as
good as you think you are, then.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.662
I like the confidence.
Impress me.

27:00.706 --> 27:02.664
We don't know Bao's identity,

27:02.708 --> 27:05.188
but I did notice
something interesting.

27:05.232 --> 27:07.451
Joseph Cheng was
an American citizen,

27:07.495 --> 27:09.628
but almost all
the other individuals we suspect

27:09.671 --> 27:12.587
the MSS targeted had to apply
for visas to work abroad.

27:12.631 --> 27:15.329
Several applications were
handled by one law firm.

27:17.461 --> 27:18.898
"Yingkai Partners."

27:18.941 --> 27:20.203
Based in Beijing,

27:20.247 --> 27:21.640
but with satellite offices
around the world.

27:21.683 --> 27:24.904
Bao and his agents working
with him needed visas, too.

27:24.947 --> 27:27.471
So maybe
that same firm handled those?

27:28.908 --> 27:30.823
Yup.

27:30.866 --> 27:32.389
The same law firm
handled 20 other

27:32.433 --> 27:36.176
- temporary H-2
- B work visas in the States, many in Honolulu.

27:36.219 --> 27:38.569
Great work. Forward me the info.

27:44.967 --> 27:47.927
Jesse and Lucy struck out
at the other businesses.

27:47.970 --> 27:50.973
- No secret agents.
- We got two more after this.

27:51.017 --> 27:53.541
Looks like it's closed, though.
Truck's parked for the night.

27:53.584 --> 27:55.674
Doesn't mean it's empty.

27:55.717 --> 27:57.850
Excuse me, sir?

27:57.893 --> 27:59.590
We're closed now.

27:59.634 --> 28:01.505
Didn't mean
to startle you.

28:01.549 --> 28:03.899
Special Agent
Tennant, NCIS.

28:03.943 --> 28:05.640
This is Special
Agent Holman.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.207
We're closed.

28:07.250 --> 28:08.687
Yeah. You mentioned that.

28:08.730 --> 28:10.906
We just want to ask
about one of your employees.

28:10.950 --> 28:12.473
A temporary worker from China.

28:12.516 --> 28:13.735
Nobody's here.

28:13.779 --> 28:15.432
But you do have
foreign employees.

28:15.476 --> 28:18.174
- I can't talk to you.
- Right. Okay.

28:18.218 --> 28:20.873
We understand.

28:20.916 --> 28:22.962
Anyone inside?

28:24.354 --> 28:25.965
Gonna need you
to step aside, sir.

28:26.008 --> 28:27.488
Just step aside.
Just step aside.

28:38.804 --> 28:40.370
Hey, Tennant?

28:41.502 --> 28:43.765
Looks like
we found our grad student.

28:43.809 --> 28:46.028
It's Harry Yen.

28:58.258 --> 28:59.389
Federal agents!

29:03.132 --> 29:04.786
Well, he wasn't lying.

29:04.830 --> 29:06.962
They're gone.

29:07.006 --> 29:09.008
But this is
definitely the place.

29:13.186 --> 29:16.189
Hey, Tennant,
you need to see this.

29:26.460 --> 29:28.070
Maggie.

29:34.816 --> 29:35.774
Maggie!

29:35.817 --> 29:38.777
Boss. She's not here.

29:38.820 --> 29:39.995
Whoever took her,
she put up a fight.

29:40.039 --> 29:41.214
Okay, we need to talk
to the neighbors.

29:41.257 --> 29:42.824
- Lucy's on it.
- Put out a BOLO.

29:42.868 --> 29:44.130
Already done.

29:44.173 --> 29:45.566
What about Maggie's phone?

29:45.609 --> 29:47.437
- Ernie can trace it.
- Here.

29:49.657 --> 29:51.528
What?

29:51.572 --> 29:53.008
Oh, man.

29:53.052 --> 29:55.794
I should've assigned her
a protective detail.

29:55.837 --> 29:58.144
You couldn't have known
they'd come after Maggie.

29:58.187 --> 30:00.059
Grabbing an American
intelligence officer--

30:00.102 --> 30:01.495
that's high-risk.

30:01.538 --> 30:02.975
Not Bao's usual M.O.

30:03.018 --> 30:04.150
He must have wanted to know
how much Cheng told her.

30:04.193 --> 30:06.805
Makes her valuable.
He'll keep her alive.

30:06.848 --> 30:09.329
Next-door neighbor saw a sedan
speed away 20 minutes ago.

30:09.372 --> 30:10.678
- They get plates?
- No.

30:10.721 --> 30:12.462
It's late model,
probably black or dark blue.

30:12.506 --> 30:13.681
- It's not much.
- Doesn't matter.

30:13.724 --> 30:14.856
Add it to the BOLO.

30:14.900 --> 30:16.118
We're gonna find her.

30:17.163 --> 30:18.991
Like we found Harry Yen?

30:26.259 --> 30:28.087
I heard rumors

30:28.130 --> 30:31.133
that IARPA has new, long-range
facial recognition software.

30:31.177 --> 30:32.656
I need access.

30:32.700 --> 30:34.484
You know I can't confirm
that even exists.

30:34.528 --> 30:37.966
- Whistler!
- I'll see if I can get you read in.

30:43.929 --> 30:45.626
Any luck with the vehicle?

30:45.669 --> 30:47.193
HPD thinks they
found the sedan,

30:47.236 --> 30:49.282
but it was burned out
and empty.

30:50.849 --> 30:54.156
- How's Tennant?
- About how you'd expect.

30:54.200 --> 30:55.897
The vehicle?

30:55.941 --> 30:57.899
Kai's still with
MCRT going over it,

30:57.943 --> 31:01.250
but it looks
like a dead end.

31:01.294 --> 31:03.426
- We got nothing else?
- We've got agents looking

31:03.470 --> 31:05.994
for everyone the Chinese
law firm helped get visas.

31:06.038 --> 31:07.561
I'm running facial recognition on every

31:07.604 --> 31:10.520
city camera I can access
looking for Bao and his people.

31:10.564 --> 31:12.871
And Sola? Where's he?
We just spoke. He's trying

31:12.914 --> 31:14.437
to get Myra's sister
out of China fast.

31:14.481 --> 31:16.178
- How long?
- He's got the resources in place,

31:16.222 --> 31:17.745
agents willing to move, but
the State Department has to...

31:17.788 --> 31:18.920
How long?

31:18.964 --> 31:21.227
- Weeks, not days.
- That's not good enough.

31:21.270 --> 31:23.577
She is our only shot
at locating Bao.

31:28.364 --> 31:30.018
Okay.

31:41.073 --> 31:43.031
I need to see Myra again.

31:43.075 --> 31:44.424
I don't think she'll...

31:44.467 --> 31:46.556
Can you make that happen?

31:48.645 --> 31:49.603
Ernie?

31:49.646 --> 31:51.170
I'll need your help.

31:58.046 --> 32:00.179
You think this
- will work?
- No idea.

32:00.222 --> 32:01.441
Here we go.

32:02.485 --> 32:04.009
You have my sister?

32:04.052 --> 32:05.793
No.

32:05.836 --> 32:08.143
Then we have nothing
to talk about.

32:08.187 --> 32:09.710
Afraid it's not that simple.

32:11.407 --> 32:13.627
What happened?
I'm sorry.

32:13.670 --> 32:15.455
Believe me,
it gives me no pleasure to...

32:15.498 --> 32:16.804
Just tell me.

32:18.414 --> 32:20.677
Your sister
and her husband are dead.

32:22.723 --> 32:26.074
I... No.

32:26.118 --> 32:28.076
I had a team in place.

32:28.120 --> 32:30.426
We were preparing for extraction
within a few days,

32:30.470 --> 32:32.037
but last night,
there was an accident.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.864
David, you can't show her.

32:33.908 --> 32:35.518
You don't want to see these.

32:35.562 --> 32:37.129
- The crash was violent.
- Show me.

32:37.172 --> 32:39.000
Myra, you don't have to.

32:39.044 --> 32:41.742
Let her see the consequences
of her choices.

32:49.315 --> 32:52.144
The brake line was cut.

32:52.187 --> 32:54.233
No doubt the work of MSS agents.

32:54.276 --> 32:56.365
Oh.

32:56.409 --> 32:58.193
Jun.

32:58.237 --> 33:00.935
Can't bring her back, Myra.

33:00.979 --> 33:03.720
But I can bring down the people
who killed her.

33:09.378 --> 33:12.686
This is the man we believe
is running Operation Dark Moon.

33:14.818 --> 33:16.820
You know him?

33:16.864 --> 33:18.213
He was a policeman in Shanghai.

33:18.257 --> 33:21.651
MSS recruited him
a few years ago.

33:21.695 --> 33:23.566
You're sure?

33:23.610 --> 33:25.307
What's his name?

33:26.569 --> 33:28.832
Ying.

33:28.876 --> 33:30.573
Enlai Ying.

33:30.617 --> 33:33.272
Running all known aliases
for Enlai Ying

33:33.315 --> 33:35.274
through our flight
and travel databases.

33:35.317 --> 33:36.840
It actually worked.

33:36.884 --> 33:38.494
I wasn't sure she'd fall
for the doctored photos.

33:38.538 --> 33:40.105
Grief makes the mind foggy.

33:40.148 --> 33:42.063
Myra would've seen through them
eventually.

33:42.107 --> 33:43.717
Hey, you play a pretty
impressive bad cop.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.719
I wasn't playing.

33:45.762 --> 33:48.069
I will admit to being surprised
by seeing this merciless

33:48.113 --> 33:50.941
spy-versus-spy side
of you, Tennant.

33:50.985 --> 33:53.074
Maggie taught me
sometimes you have to do bad

33:53.118 --> 33:54.249
to get something good.

33:55.642 --> 33:56.947
Got something.

33:56.991 --> 33:58.558
Hang on. Ernie's
got something.

33:58.601 --> 33:59.994
All right, go.

34:00.038 --> 34:02.388
Ying used an alias to fly
into town two weeks ago.

34:02.431 --> 34:05.304
The same credit card was used
to book an Airbnb in Waimanalo.

34:05.347 --> 34:07.784
All right, send me the address
and have the team meet me there.

34:07.828 --> 34:09.003
Mind if I tag along?

34:09.047 --> 34:11.049
Gonna need all the help
I can get.

34:20.971 --> 34:22.973
I count at least four suspects.

34:23.017 --> 34:24.149
- Any sign of Maggie?
- No,

34:24.192 --> 34:25.541
but I can't see all the rooms.

34:25.585 --> 34:27.021
- We wait for SWAT?
- No time.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.153
Jesse, Lucy, you're with me.

34:28.196 --> 34:29.328
Kai, you cover the rear.

34:30.459 --> 34:31.634
I'll go with him.

34:31.678 --> 34:32.853
No. You have no authority here.

34:32.896 --> 34:34.333
No, but I'm good
in a crisis.

34:37.640 --> 34:39.555
Get him a vest.

34:41.557 --> 34:43.037
And a weapon?

34:43.081 --> 34:45.779
- Team player, right?
- I got your back, brah.

35:00.141 --> 35:02.578
Federal agents!
Drop your weapon!

35:14.590 --> 35:16.157
Get down!

35:18.203 --> 35:20.814
Don't move.

35:25.297 --> 35:27.864
Help! In here!

35:27.908 --> 35:29.736
Janie!

35:31.999 --> 35:34.175
Enlai Ying,
drop the weapon.

35:39.659 --> 35:41.313
It's okay. It's okay.

35:41.356 --> 35:43.358
It's okay. I'm here.

35:44.925 --> 35:46.361
I guess we're even now.

35:57.894 --> 35:59.592
I think I'm finally
getting too old for this.

35:59.635 --> 36:01.898
I don't know. You looked like
- you were giving Bao hell.
- Hmm.

36:01.942 --> 36:04.640
Thanks.

36:06.729 --> 36:08.427
He knew about you
and the kids.

36:08.470 --> 36:11.212
Threatened you to try
to get me to talk.

36:11.256 --> 36:13.432
He wanted to know how much Cheng
told you about his operation.

36:13.475 --> 36:14.911
More than that.

36:14.955 --> 36:19.829
He was pressuring me
about other intel operations.

36:19.873 --> 36:21.527
- He knew you were CIA.
- Yeah.

36:21.570 --> 36:23.833
I didn't expect him
to come after you.

36:23.877 --> 36:25.487
Bao usually keeps
a lower profile.

36:25.531 --> 36:27.185
I think he was
getting desperate.

36:27.228 --> 36:28.882
I overheard him on the phone.

36:28.925 --> 36:30.362
The mission had gone sideways.

36:30.405 --> 36:32.233
They'd ordered him back home.

36:32.277 --> 36:34.801
Who knows the price
he'd pay for failure.

36:34.844 --> 36:36.498
Just a hell of a day.

36:36.542 --> 36:38.500
But nothing that a hot bath

36:38.544 --> 36:40.110
and a nice glass

36:40.154 --> 36:43.070
of 21-year-old Scotch won't fix.

36:44.114 --> 36:45.855
You can do that
at my place.

36:45.899 --> 36:49.207
I'm not letting you
out of my sight.

36:49.250 --> 36:50.469
Thanks.

36:54.603 --> 36:57.040
Just finished up
at Ying's place.

36:57.084 --> 36:59.956
Found the thallium
that was used to poison Cheng.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.177
MSS agents we arrested are in
FBI custody being questioned.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.222
I doubt they'll talk, but

37:04.265 --> 37:05.614
it does look like
we got justice

37:05.658 --> 37:07.094
for Joseph Cheng and his cousin.

37:07.137 --> 37:09.792
And shut down
a Chinese spy ring.

37:09.836 --> 37:11.925
- Hey.
- Anybody seen Sola?

37:11.968 --> 37:13.927
Kind of want him to thank me
again for saving him.

37:13.970 --> 37:15.450
Nah.

37:15.494 --> 37:16.582
Not since after the raid.

37:16.625 --> 37:17.757
Maybe he left you

37:17.800 --> 37:18.932
a thoughtful letter
in your desk.

37:18.975 --> 37:21.587
Sola is on his way
back to New Zealand.

37:21.630 --> 37:23.415
But...

37:23.458 --> 37:26.069
I do want to thank you
for your help on this.

37:26.113 --> 37:30.073
Nah, boss.
It's... it's what we do.

37:30.117 --> 37:32.337
And no team does it better.

37:39.648 --> 37:41.998
Everything okay?

37:42.042 --> 37:44.871
Yeah. All good.

37:44.914 --> 37:46.089
See you tomorrow.

37:47.134 --> 37:48.875
Grab a drink?
Can't tonight.

37:48.918 --> 37:51.399
Kids are all out,
we got two whole hours

37:51.443 --> 37:53.793
- and the TV to ourselves.
- Ooh.

37:53.836 --> 37:55.142
Real rager, huh?

37:55.185 --> 37:57.100
For us.
You're welcome to join, Luce.

37:57.144 --> 37:59.842
No. I'd only
- slow you down.
- Hey.

38:02.236 --> 38:04.107
I'm good, Jesse. I'm gonna

38:04.151 --> 38:07.633
go out, let loose a little
and put the past behind me.

38:07.676 --> 38:09.548
Sounds like my
kind of night.

38:09.591 --> 38:11.550
I'm up for a
drink or three.

38:11.593 --> 38:14.466
Ooh! Yeah.

38:14.509 --> 38:17.338
♪ Yes, you drive me crazy

38:17.382 --> 38:20.210
♪ Tease me day and night

38:20.254 --> 38:21.473
♪ So come on, lickkle lady...

38:21.516 --> 38:23.518
Clearly,

38:23.562 --> 38:26.521
you don't know the saying
about house guests and fish.

38:26.565 --> 38:28.958
I was in the car on the way
to the airport,

38:29.002 --> 38:30.612
and I had him turn around.

38:30.656 --> 38:32.788
- To Kai's father's restaurant?
- I know.

38:32.832 --> 38:35.008
At first, it was just
to get under Kai's skin.

38:35.051 --> 38:37.140
- And now?
- Well, still to get under his skin,

38:37.184 --> 38:38.925
but, you know,
the food is incredible.

38:41.971 --> 38:43.582
Okay.

38:43.625 --> 38:45.801
What gives?

38:46.889 --> 38:49.849
Something about this whole thing
just didn't sit right with me,

38:49.892 --> 38:51.329
so I started digging.

38:51.372 --> 38:52.460
Into what?

38:52.504 --> 38:53.766
Enlai Ying.

38:53.809 --> 38:55.463
When Myra gave us
his name,

38:55.507 --> 38:56.899
she seemed surprised

38:56.943 --> 38:59.511
that he'd be running
an operation like this.

39:00.555 --> 39:05.168
Myra knew he was an MSS agent,

39:05.212 --> 39:07.257
but she never actually
identified him as Bao.

39:07.301 --> 39:09.259
This Ying guy

39:09.303 --> 39:11.349
was a city cop
up until two years ago.

39:11.392 --> 39:13.481
Bao's been working
much longer than that.

39:13.525 --> 39:15.178
So, I started looking

39:15.222 --> 39:18.356
at the suspected Dark Moon
operations we identified.

39:18.399 --> 39:21.141
And Ying was in Shanghai
when most of them occurred.

39:21.184 --> 39:23.665
So there is no way
he could have run all those ops.

39:26.451 --> 39:28.540
Enlai Ying isn't Bao.

39:31.107 --> 39:33.240
- We got the wrong man.
- But

39:33.283 --> 39:35.547
there is one Chinese agent
on traffic cam footage

39:35.590 --> 39:37.331
that wasn't at the takedown.

39:38.854 --> 39:40.856
I think this is the real Bao.

39:43.990 --> 39:45.731
And he's still in the wind.

39:51.606 --> 39:53.652
Thanks. I'll look into it.

39:58.700 --> 40:00.833
Hey. Thanks for staying.

40:00.876 --> 40:02.878
Like I ever leave.

40:04.880 --> 40:07.100
- I did what you asked.
- And?

40:08.188 --> 40:10.059
These are all the
Dark Moon operations

40:10.103 --> 40:11.974
we believe were led by Bao.

40:12.018 --> 40:15.325
I cross-referenced them with
the locations you texted me.

40:15.369 --> 40:16.718
Oh.

40:16.762 --> 40:18.459
So...

40:18.503 --> 40:21.027
you want to say
what these locations are?

40:21.070 --> 40:25.031
All places Maggie has traveled
the past few years.

40:25.074 --> 40:29.035
Conferences, vacations,
lectures.

40:29.078 --> 40:32.604
I mean...
could be a coincidence.

40:32.647 --> 40:33.953
Maggie'd say
there's no such thing.

40:39.001 --> 40:40.829
She told me Enlai Ying

40:40.873 --> 40:43.223
was running an operation

40:43.266 --> 40:46.444
in Taipei five years ago.

40:46.487 --> 40:47.836
But that's impossible.

40:48.881 --> 40:50.491
Could've been mistaken.

40:50.535 --> 40:53.799
No. No.

40:55.670 --> 40:58.020
Maggie's too good to make
that kind of mistake.

40:58.064 --> 41:00.588
So what are we saying?

41:00.632 --> 41:03.330
Is Maggie Shaw working
for the Chinese?

41:08.466 --> 41:10.729
- You're not even listening.
- I was.

41:10.772 --> 41:12.992
Yeah, that's what I would've done anyway.

41:13.035 --> 41:15.168
I mean, you got to show
those girls who's boss.

41:15.211 --> 41:16.778
I'd get in trouble.

41:16.822 --> 41:19.477
I know. You would get in so much trouble,

41:19.520 --> 41:21.261
but they would never
tease you again.

41:21.304 --> 41:23.089
Really?
Yeah, I'm just saying.

41:23.132 --> 41:25.004
Right? Were you listening?
Yes.

41:25.047 --> 41:26.527
Why don't you participate?

41:26.571 --> 41:28.486
- Hey, everybody.
- Hi, Mom! Hey!

41:28.529 --> 41:29.965
- Hi.
- Hey, Mom.

41:30.009 --> 41:32.272
Just in time.
Dinner's almost ready.

41:33.621 --> 41:34.666
Janie?

41:36.450 --> 41:38.234
Is everything okay?

41:38.278 --> 41:41.890
Everything's... just fine.

41:44.502 --> 41:45.851
Good.

41:45.894 --> 41:47.679
Well, uh, let's
have dinner.

41:47.722 --> 41:49.158
Will you put the
salad on the table?

41:49.202 --> 41:51.900
You, put your phone
down and help.
