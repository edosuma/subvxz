Black Lightning...

00:02.436 --> 00:04.937
My parents sent me to you
because they were worried

00:04.939 --> 00:07.072
I wouldn't be able to control
my powers.

00:08.409 --> 00:11.977
You are the storm,
so you can control the storm!

00:14.081 --> 00:15.914
I've been waiting
to beat your pasty ass.

00:15.916 --> 00:18.450
I will kill you.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.053
[Khalil]<i> He's not gonna stop.</i>

00:21.055 --> 00:23.989
Tobias is the reason
why I was paralyzed.

00:23.991 --> 00:26.225
Khalil, why are you
still staying with him?

00:26.227 --> 00:28.694
It's not like I have
anywhere else to go.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.796
You look pretty good
for a dead guy.

00:30.798 --> 00:32.564
Someone tried
to assassinate me.

00:32.566 --> 00:35.567
It's better that they still
think that I'm dead.

00:35.569 --> 00:38.370
Being locked up in a room
is definitely not a life.

00:38.372 --> 00:41.173

[Khalil sighs]
I gotta make a stop.

01:32.026 --> 01:33.325
Look, all my stuff
is at my place,

01:33.327 --> 01:35.294
and we're gonna need money
on the run.

01:36.063 --> 01:39.164

02:18.439 --> 02:20.072
Yeah?

02:20.074 --> 02:22.207
I thought collection
was tomorrow.

02:22.209 --> 02:26.812
New policy. Tobias wants me
to collect every Tuesday.

02:26.814 --> 02:29.214
[chuckles] Could be that.

[Lynn] Gambi. Jeff told me.

05:02.102 --> 05:05.671
I didn't believe
that you're actually alive.

05:07.107 --> 05:08.640
[Gambi] Lynn, I'm sorry.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.976
I know I put you guys
through a lot.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.612
You have no idea
what you put us through.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.647
What, were you just gonna
leave us in the dark forever?

05:15.649 --> 05:17.649
[Jefferson] Okay, we can
discuss this another time.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.052
Right now, we need to focus
on finding Jen.

05:20.054 --> 05:21.486
So what have you got?

05:21.488 --> 05:24.189
I've already checked all of
the major transportation hubs.

05:24.191 --> 05:26.258
There's no sign of her
at Freeland International

05:26.260 --> 05:27.526
or any of the bus
or train stations.

05:27.528 --> 05:30.762
So she's either in a car
or on foot.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.397
When did you last see her?

05:32.966 --> 05:34.232
It was earlier tonight.

05:34.234 --> 05:38.870
She was helping me
after the pod kids.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.639
We don't have much time, then.
The further away she gets,

05:40.641 --> 05:42.708
the harder it's gonna be
to find her.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.409
What did Perenna say?

05:45.412 --> 05:48.280
She thinks she ran away
with some boy.

05:50.417 --> 05:51.483
Khalil.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.020
The night that Dad and I
got into it,

05:55.022 --> 05:56.722
she came to my room
and her phone was out.

05:56.724 --> 05:57.856
I saw a text...

06:02.162 --> 06:03.995
-Oh, God.
-You didn't say anything?

06:03.997 --> 06:05.030
Dad, I talked to her about--

06:05.032 --> 06:06.598
[Jefferson]
No, Khalil is dangerous.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.901
He attacked Garfield.
He tried to kill me.

06:09.903 --> 06:11.837
If he's with Jen...

06:15.175 --> 06:17.509
Contact Henderson,
tell him to put out an APB.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.177
Okay.

06:19.179 --> 06:21.313
Reach out to Jen's friends.
Call Kiesha.

06:21.315 --> 06:23.448
-She may have heard something.
-I'm on it.

06:23.450 --> 06:26.318
Bring up the surveillance
and traffic cameras.

06:26.320 --> 06:28.954
We'll start near the house,
and work our way out.

06:30.324 --> 06:32.457
Hey, hey, hey, let me go!

06:32.459 --> 06:34.025

Please!
Hey, hey, hey, man, come on!

06:39.299 --> 06:42.067
Let me go, man!

06:42.069 --> 06:43.969
Come on,
we can do this together.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.341
Any idea why
she might've run off?

06:49.943 --> 06:51.076
Not sure.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.377
Might be something to do
with our decision

06:52.379 --> 06:54.212
to homeschool her.

06:54.214 --> 06:56.615
She ran off with Khalil
to spite us.

06:58.819 --> 07:01.319
Bill, I know you and Jeff
haven't seen eye-to-eye lately

07:01.321 --> 07:03.722
-on a lot of things, but--
-Lynn, Lynn, please.

07:03.724 --> 07:06.024
Jen is like a niece
to Veretta and me.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.092
And I would do everything
in my power

07:07.094 --> 07:08.160
to help get her back.

07:08.162 --> 07:09.761
But I'm not gonna lie to you.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.630
Our hands are pretty full
right now

07:11.632 --> 07:14.533
with these Green Light Babies
poppin' up.

07:14.535 --> 07:16.301
When they're high,
we can't handle them,

07:16.303 --> 07:18.036
but they come down hard.

07:19.373 --> 07:20.972
So I'll get eyes
on the street,

07:20.974 --> 07:23.475
hotels, hospitals,
spread a net.

07:23.477 --> 07:25.610
There's already a warrant out
for Khalil's arrest,

07:25.612 --> 07:28.246
but we can file a missing
persons report for Jen.

07:28.248 --> 07:29.748
Okay, thank you.

07:51.271 --> 07:53.538
I just appreciate you.
That's all.

08:39.319 --> 08:40.552
[Khalil] We needed the money.

You said we were making
a quick stop,

08:48.161 --> 08:49.861
I didn't even know. I'm sorry.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.931
I was just trying to keep you
from being involved.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.399
My involvement?

08:54.401 --> 08:56.434
I just had to use my powers
in public.

08:56.436 --> 08:58.470
I'd say at this point
I'm pretty damn involved.

08:58.472 --> 09:00.805
I know, okay? And I'm sorry.

09:00.807 --> 09:01.673
But right now,

friend's houses?

09:16.089 --> 09:19.424
No, no, no, that's the first
place my parents will look.

09:19.426 --> 09:21.560
-[Khalil] A motel?
-That's too risky, too.

09:21.562 --> 09:23.828
Somebody might recognize us.
They might call the cops.

Right, right, right.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.033
Wait.

09:28.368 --> 09:29.467
Okay, look, hey.

09:29.469 --> 09:32.270
My aunt...
let's go to her house, okay?

09:32.272 --> 09:33.572
She has a place up
in Henley Heights,

09:33.574 --> 09:34.739
over by the peach farms.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.441
Maybe we could crash
there tonight,

09:36.443 --> 09:37.943
grab some supplies
before leaving town.

09:37.945 --> 09:40.045
Okay. That sounds good.
We need to go, though!

to get to a phone.

10:25.592 --> 10:27.158
So I can call my parents.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.628
Say what? No, absolutely not.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.029
That's too much of a risk.

10:31.031 --> 10:32.263
They'll know where we are.

10:32.265 --> 10:33.832
No, they won't.
I'll be smart about it.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.300
I'll make sure the call
can't be traced.

10:40.540 --> 10:43.141
He won't find you. All I'm
doing is calling my parents.

10:43.143 --> 10:46.077
Jen, I said no, okay?
I can't go back, I won't--

10:46.079 --> 10:47.979
You really need to calm down.
They have the right--

10:47.981 --> 10:52.250
J! I said no. I said no!

10:53.787 --> 10:57.522
I tried all of Jen's friends.
No one's heard from her.

10:57.524 --> 10:59.090
I think I found something.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.727
Whoa! What was that?

11:02.729 --> 11:04.262
I think you mean "who."

another bird up in the sky,

11:18.045 --> 11:21.012
see if we can get eyes on
that car that they're driving.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.715

The description
matches the girl

11:27.087 --> 11:29.104
in the missing person report.

11:29.105 --> 11:31.122
All right. Tell them not to do
anything until I get there.

12:44.831 --> 12:48.433
Actually, I have a strict
"no mama" rule.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.702
I believe a man
has to have principles.

12:51.705 --> 12:55.607
But I do need you
to contact your son...

12:58.311 --> 13:00.378
tell him to keep
his thick lips shut.

13:01.681 --> 13:03.848
I thought he was with you.

13:03.850 --> 13:08.052
Hmm. He left town
with that Pierce girl.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.323
Boy knows a lot
about my business.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.727
I have plans.

13:17.230 --> 13:20.865
I'd surely hate to have
to change those plans.

13:22.469 --> 13:25.136
I don't have no way
to reach him.

13:25.939 --> 13:27.272
Even if I did,

13:28.275 --> 13:30.742
you'd have to kill me first.

13:32.646 --> 13:34.212
I respect that.

You're a strong black woman,
I can tell.

14:05.111 --> 14:07.011
We need a place to stay.

14:07.012 --> 14:08.912
Does this have
anything to do with what
I've been hearing on the news?

14:08.915 --> 14:11.416
Is this her?
The girl you kidnapped?

14:11.418 --> 14:14.052
No, he didn't kidnap me.
We kind of ran off together.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.620
Look, it's not
what it looks like.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.922
And we can explain everything.

14:17.924 --> 14:18.957
Your mother knew
you were coming?

14:18.959 --> 14:21.659
No, no, no, and she can't.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.995
Look, if they find out,
they'll kill her.

14:23.997 --> 14:27.498
Auntie, please. Look, we ain't
got nowhere else to go.

14:27.500 --> 14:30.802
It'll just be for tonight,
I promise.

14:30.804 --> 14:33.471
-Are you really okay?
-Yes, ma'am. I swear.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.941
Well, come on in here
before somebody sees you.

14:36.943 --> 14:39.277
-Thank you.
-[Khalil] Thanks, Auntie.

14:39.279 --> 14:40.678
I gotta get a room together.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.914
Put your stuff down.
I'll go gather some sheets.

14:48.688 --> 14:50.154
I'm gonna get
the rest of our things.

14:50.156 --> 14:51.222
Hey.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.826
I'm sorry, okay?

14:54.828 --> 14:56.728
I shouldn't have yelled
at you like that before.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.329
Yeah, you should be sorry.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.431
What the hell was that?

15:01.034 --> 15:02.700
[sighs]

15:02.702 --> 15:05.803
Something just came over me.
Okay?

15:06.673 --> 15:09.574
Jen, the things
Tobias did to me,

15:09.576 --> 15:12.443
hitting me, burning me...

15:12.445 --> 15:14.379
I just didn't want him
to find us.

15:17.117 --> 15:19.217
I snapped.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.586
Well, you snap at me
like that again,

15:21.588 --> 15:23.421
and Tobias is gonna be
the last person

15:23.423 --> 15:25.256
you're gonna have to
worry about.

15:25.258 --> 15:28.393
I will light your ass up.
You need to remember that.

15:29.062 --> 15:30.128
I know.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.502
Here.

15:38.872 --> 15:41.139
I picked it up
when we stopped for gas.

15:42.876 --> 15:44.709
You were right.

15:44.711 --> 15:47.178
Your parents deserve to know
that you're okay.

15:49.215 --> 15:50.281
I'll get the bags.

15:53.186 --> 15:54.285
Thank you.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.063
[man 1 grunts]

16:06.032 --> 16:08.399
I didn't come here
for no damn games, bruh!

16:10.103 --> 16:11.369
[man 2]
Take care of this clown.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.204
You.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.908
Painkiller and the girl,
where'd they go?

16:19.145 --> 16:21.913
-I ain't no snitch.
-Uh-uh. Wrong answer.

16:29.456 --> 16:31.923
I guess you ain't no snitch
either, huh, big man?

16:31.925 --> 16:34.392
The Negro went that way.
He took a right on Morrison.

16:34.394 --> 16:35.560
His girl was driving.

16:35.561 --> 16:36.727
They're in a blue
Barracuda convertible.

16:36.730 --> 16:39.063
But I didn't get
the license plate number.

16:42.769 --> 16:44.435
[man 3] Yo, man,
what you tell him for?

16:44.437 --> 16:45.870
Whatever.

16:49.409 --> 16:50.475
[phone beeps]

16:51.478 --> 16:52.543
Hello?

16:53.179 --> 16:54.445
It's me, Harriet.

16:55.281 --> 16:56.347
Oh, my God! Jen!

16:57.317 --> 16:59.550
Gambi, Jen's calling.
We need a trace.

17:01.087 --> 17:03.221
-On it!
-[Anissa]<i> Jen, where are you?</i>

17:03.223 --> 17:05.323
[Jennifer]<i> Look,</i>
<i> I can't tell you that, but...</i>

17:05.325 --> 17:07.925
I wanted to call
just so you knew I was okay.

17:07.927 --> 17:09.961
Are you with Khalil?
Is he making you say that?

17:09.963 --> 17:12.296
[Jennifer]<i> No, nobody's</i>
<i> making me do anything. Okay?</i>

17:12.298 --> 17:13.998
Keep her on the line.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.199
[Jennifer]
<i> I really have to go,</i>

17:15.201 --> 17:17.201
but please tell Mom and Dad
that I'm safe.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.003
-<i> Wait, Jen, listen to me--</i>
-I love you, Harriet.

17:19.005 --> 17:21.105
<i> Jen... Jennifer!</i>

17:22.175 --> 17:23.241
<i> Jen!</i>

17:26.312 --> 17:27.378
She hung up.

17:28.181 --> 17:29.247
[sighs]

17:34.988 --> 17:36.187
Any luck with the Barracuda?

17:36.189 --> 17:37.255
They must've ditched it
somewhere.

17:37.257 --> 17:39.023
Were you able to trace
Jen's call?

17:39.025 --> 17:41.526
[sighs] All I could get
was the nearest cell tower.

17:41.528 --> 17:44.862
Oh, my God. What's the range
on a tower like that?

17:44.864 --> 17:46.898
Up to 40 miles.
They could be almost anywhere.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.133
Oh, damn it!

17:49.602 --> 17:50.635
Where's your father?

17:50.637 --> 17:52.603
[sighs] He went home
to check on Mom.

17:52.605 --> 17:54.138
You should get some rest, too.

17:54.140 --> 17:56.007
I'll keep searching
the traffic cameras

17:56.009 --> 17:59.177
and hopefully I will find out
where they ditched that car.

18:01.915 --> 18:04.882
You know, I still can't
believe you're alive.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.517
You and your secrets.

18:11.891 --> 18:14.358
I am sorry, Anissa.

18:14.360 --> 18:17.595
I was only trying to protect
you and your family.

18:17.597 --> 18:18.663
Yeah?

18:19.732 --> 18:21.766
Like when you were trying
to protect us

18:21.768 --> 18:23.734
and you lied about being
attached to the ASA?

18:23.736 --> 18:25.036
Or when you hid the fact

18:25.038 --> 18:27.872
that Tobias was still
in Freeland? Huh?

18:27.874 --> 18:31.175
Anissa! If the people
that tried to kill me

18:31.177 --> 18:32.343
knew that I was
connected to you,

18:32.345 --> 18:33.911
they would come after
you next.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.179
Why would I believe you?

18:35.181 --> 18:37.115
Because you know
I'm telling you the truth.

18:38.418 --> 18:41.052
You didn't tell your dad
when you were stealing money

18:41.054 --> 18:42.420
for the pod kids
in that clinic.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.088
Oh, come on,
that's completely different.

18:44.090 --> 18:45.456
-Is it?
-Yes.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.792
Well, sometimes we keep things
from the people we love

18:47.794 --> 18:49.594
in order to protect them.

18:49.596 --> 18:53.097
Raising your dad and being
a part of your family

18:53.099 --> 18:56.400
is the best thing in my life.
Leaving you guys

18:56.402 --> 18:58.069
was the hardest thing
I've ever done.

18:58.071 --> 19:01.038
But I had to do it
in order to protect you.

19:02.075 --> 19:03.674
And if you don't believe
anything else,

19:03.676 --> 19:05.610
just believe that.

19:10.083 --> 19:15.620
Yeah, well, we're not
a family without Jen.

19:16.189 --> 19:17.955
So keep looking, okay?

19:17.957 --> 19:20.091
She's gotta be
somewhere out there.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.096
Uncle Gambi...

19:33.439 --> 19:34.639
thank you.

19:35.542 --> 19:36.474
I know that was you

19:36.476 --> 19:38.543
looking out for us
in those woods.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.080
Always.

19:57.864 --> 20:01.132
[panting]

20:05.638 --> 20:06.871
[Jennifer on recording]
<i> Hey, this is Jen.</i>

20:06.873 --> 20:08.139
<i> Leave a message.</i>

20:43.876 --> 20:45.142
[softly] Jen...

20:52.752 --> 20:53.851
Jen...

21:07.800 --> 21:10.501
[sobbing]

21:16.542 --> 21:18.242
Lynn! Lynn!

21:18.244 --> 21:20.611
-No, Lynn, just leave it.
-[Lynn] No!

21:20.613 --> 21:24.315
-It's okay, it's okay.
-[Lynn] Jen...

21:24.317 --> 21:27.785
It's okay. It's okay.

21:37.096 --> 21:38.529
Okay, look.

21:38.531 --> 21:43.200
There's gotta be some way that
we can disguise my identity.

21:43.202 --> 21:44.602
[Jennifer] Mmm-mmm.
Sorry, brother,

21:44.604 --> 21:46.237
these locks gotta go.

21:46.239 --> 21:49.040
Wait, hold up.
You didn't like them?

21:49.042 --> 21:51.208
You looked like
Whoopi Goldberg.

21:51.210 --> 21:54.612
[chuckles] Plus, aren't they
just gonna grow back anyway?

21:54.614 --> 21:56.714
No, I stopped taking
the regeneration pills

21:56.716 --> 21:58.282
that made 'em grow so fast.

21:58.284 --> 22:01.552
I haven't needed 'em ever
since I started walking again.

22:06.926 --> 22:08.192
Hey.

22:10.763 --> 22:13.264
[sighs] You know...

22:14.334 --> 22:17.568
I didn't mean
what I said earlier,

22:18.638 --> 22:19.837
about me getting shot.

22:21.407 --> 22:24.675
And I know I said I did,
but it wasn't true.

22:25.878 --> 22:26.944
It's just that...

22:28.448 --> 22:31.382
I don't know, running was
my ticket out of here.

22:31.384 --> 22:33.384
And I was gonna take you
with me.

22:34.253 --> 22:36.587
But then that bullet
struck my spine.

22:36.589 --> 22:39.023
Going to the Olympics,
I mean, everything...

22:39.025 --> 22:40.658
it all got shattered.

22:43.296 --> 22:44.829
I just tripped.

22:47.266 --> 22:51.302
Well, you got your wish.
Look at us. We're running now.

22:51.304 --> 22:54.572
Hey, the truth is,

22:56.008 --> 22:58.242
I don't really care
if we're running,

22:59.312 --> 23:01.445
as long as I'm with you.

23:08.054 --> 23:09.520
Tilt your head.

23:10.456 --> 23:12.056
-[hair clippers buzzing]
-Uh, wait.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.424
[Jennifer] Tilt your head.

23:16.629 --> 23:17.962
What is that?

23:18.631 --> 23:20.197
[Khalil] Uh...

23:20.199 --> 23:21.899
You got some kinda
lump back here.

23:22.668 --> 23:23.834
[Khalil] Huh?

23:24.804 --> 23:25.903
Weird.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.104
You need to get that
checked out.

23:27.106 --> 23:28.606
It might be cancer.

23:28.608 --> 23:31.175
All right. Come on,
how much longer we gotta go?

23:31.177 --> 23:32.843
We still gotta do your hair.

23:36.349 --> 23:38.015
Don't even joke like that.

23:39.519 --> 23:42.420
-Yo, it's just a weave.
-Yeah, an expensive one.

23:42.422 --> 23:43.487
I don't care who's chasing me,

23:43.489 --> 23:45.189
I'm not cutting this
for nobody.

23:45.191 --> 23:46.457
You got that?

23:47.493 --> 23:48.692
Okay.

23:51.798 --> 23:52.997
[Khalil chuckles]

24:03.709 --> 24:04.909
Our plan...

24:06.646 --> 24:07.912
failed, Tori.

24:08.881 --> 24:10.047
That boy...

24:11.684 --> 24:14.618
he was supposed to make
Black Lightning his enemy,

24:15.855 --> 24:17.054
but he's weak.

24:17.723 --> 24:19.056
He ran away.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.059
Now he's our enemy.

24:24.664 --> 24:25.763
I should've known.

24:25.765 --> 24:28.599
Can't trust a Negro
as far as you can throw him.

24:29.936 --> 24:33.537
I knew his ass wasn't a killer
but I kept giving him chances.

24:34.674 --> 24:35.739
[sighs]

24:36.776 --> 24:38.075
You're right.

24:39.011 --> 24:40.945
That is my problem, isn't it?

24:40.947 --> 24:44.081
I get stubborn and try things
over and over again.

24:45.785 --> 24:47.384
Well, not anymore.

24:47.386 --> 24:48.886
From now on,
if something ain't working,

24:48.888 --> 24:50.688
I'm gonna change it.

24:52.158 --> 24:53.958
Yeah, I'mma change it.

25:01.567 --> 25:04.068
You were the best person
in my life.

25:50.917 --> 25:52.149
Did Jen do that?

25:53.419 --> 25:54.685
[Jefferson] Mmm-mmm.

25:56.088 --> 25:57.721
Your mother got upset...

26:00.560 --> 26:04.428
Gambi, was he able to trace
Jen's phone?

26:04.430 --> 26:07.898
No, all he could get
was the nearest cell tower.

26:16.842 --> 26:18.776
[sighs]

26:19.645 --> 26:21.645
You should have
said something.

26:23.316 --> 26:24.582
What?

26:25.785 --> 26:28.385
Khalil's text,
you should've told us.

26:28.387 --> 26:31.188
We could've talked to her
before it was too late.

26:33.025 --> 26:34.792
Are you blaming this on me?

26:34.794 --> 26:37.227
What? No. But if you had
told us, then maybe we--

26:37.229 --> 26:39.630
Wow, wow! Okay.

26:41.400 --> 26:42.766
Did you ever stop and think

26:42.768 --> 26:47.404
why she was talking to Khalil
in the first place? Hmm?

26:47.406 --> 26:50.040
Maybe it had something to do
with the fact that,

26:50.042 --> 26:51.775
I don't know...

26:51.777 --> 26:54.311
you and Mom
never let her out the house,

26:54.313 --> 26:55.846
that you treated her
like she was

26:55.848 --> 26:56.814
some kinda prisoner.

26:56.816 --> 26:58.148
Wait, we didn't treat her
like a prisoner.

26:58.150 --> 26:59.416
We were trying to protect her.

26:59.418 --> 27:01.819
No, you were just trying
to control her.

27:01.821 --> 27:05.122
You acted like she was some
kind of freak or a monster!

27:05.124 --> 27:07.191
All your rules, your quotes,

27:07.193 --> 27:08.292
and all of your
phone check-ins...

27:08.294 --> 27:11.762
It was too much, Dad.
Too damn much!

27:13.432 --> 27:15.699
You drove her away...

27:18.270 --> 27:19.703
just like you did me.

27:33.919 --> 27:35.219
[knock at door]

27:40.426 --> 27:42.426
Nichelle?

27:42.428 --> 27:44.261
I know I'm probably
the last person

27:44.263 --> 27:46.664
you'd expect to see, but--

27:46.666 --> 27:48.932
Please, come in. Come on in.

27:51.137 --> 27:53.971
Lynn, I'm so sorry.

27:55.007 --> 27:59.143
You and Jefferson,
you tried calling.

27:59.145 --> 28:02.146
I thought you just wanted
to reach out to Khalil again.

28:02.148 --> 28:06.150
I didn't know he and Jen
had run off together.

28:06.152 --> 28:09.586
You both were so kind
when he was in the hospital.

28:09.588 --> 28:11.455
I would've never
wanted your daughter

28:11.457 --> 28:13.323
to get mixed up in all this.

28:13.325 --> 28:14.892
Please, sit down.

28:16.562 --> 28:19.530
-[Nichelle sighs]
-Are you okay?

28:20.399 --> 28:22.866
He's all caught up.

28:22.868 --> 28:25.969
Might not be too late
for your daughter, though.

28:25.971 --> 28:28.372
I couldn't live
with myself knowing

28:28.374 --> 28:32.976
that someone else's child had
to suffer because of my son.

28:33.979 --> 28:36.013
My sister, Yvette,

28:36.015 --> 28:39.183
she has a place
on the outskirts of town.

28:40.653 --> 28:45.289
If Khalil's smart,
he'll take Jennifer there.

28:48.494 --> 28:50.060
Thank you.

28:53.499 --> 28:55.065
Maybe they didn't get
enough money last night,

28:55.067 --> 28:56.700
and they gotta hit up
another spot.

28:56.702 --> 28:58.602
All right. We'll start with
that safe house on Fitzgerald.

28:58.604 --> 28:59.570
[cell phone vibrating]

29:02.875 --> 29:04.775
Yeah, Lynn.

29:04.776 --> 29:06.676
Khalil's mom is here.
She thinks she might
know where Jen is.

29:06.679 --> 29:08.345
-Where?
-<i> Khalil's aunt has a house.</i>

29:08.347 --> 29:10.681
-I'll send you the address.
-<i> All right, I'm on it.</i>

29:11.383 --> 29:13.016
New plan. Let's roll.

29:13.018 --> 29:14.218
Let's get the van.

29:15.287 --> 29:16.920
Actually, Anissa...

29:18.557 --> 29:22.025
I thought you could use
something of your own.

29:43.716 --> 29:45.549
[jazz music playing]

29:45.551 --> 29:50.187
-[knock at door]
-[door opens]

29:50.189 --> 29:51.622
I see you found the place.

29:52.958 --> 29:55.325
I also see
your price has gone up.

29:55.327 --> 29:56.860
You get what you paid for.

30:00.633 --> 30:03.734
I thought you were
against hiring black folks.

30:03.736 --> 30:06.637
No, just thick-lipped,
incompetent darkies

30:06.639 --> 30:09.139
like the one
I want you to find.

30:09.141 --> 30:11.408
Thought I'd get a discount,
considering our past.

30:11.410 --> 30:15.012
Hmm. If I factored in
our past, I wouldn't be here.

30:15.014 --> 30:16.914
[Tobias chuckles]
Yet here you are.

30:21.487 --> 30:23.287
Sorry to hear about Tori.

30:24.523 --> 30:26.423
I know what she meant to you.

30:27.593 --> 30:29.259
It was just yesterday
she was telling me

30:29.261 --> 30:30.761
I'm too stubborn,

30:31.463 --> 30:33.230
need to try new things.

30:35.201 --> 30:37.100
I thought she was dead.

30:37.102 --> 30:38.769
So, history or not...

30:40.239 --> 30:42.356
I better get my money's worth.

30:42.357 --> 30:44.474
[scoffs] Okay.
All right, here we go
with the threats.

30:44.476 --> 30:46.777
I see you haven't changed.

30:46.779 --> 30:48.645
Ain't nobody scared
of your pale ass, Tobias,

30:48.647 --> 30:51.014
so you can stop right now
with your bad guy act.

30:51.016 --> 30:53.817
Just tell me who this
person is you want found.

31:00.693 --> 31:04.294
[Tobias] Him...
But I want him alive.

31:05.865 --> 31:08.398
If you have a tracker,
what do you need me for?

31:08.400 --> 31:09.766
You can nab him yourself.

31:09.768 --> 31:12.402
Have you not seen
the news lately?

31:12.404 --> 31:14.905
I'm an upstanding citizen now.

31:14.907 --> 31:18.442
I can't risk doing it,
but it's got to get done.

31:19.778 --> 31:23.380
Besides,
my people tried already.

31:23.382 --> 31:26.850
Sometimes it's best to leave
things to the professionals.

31:30.356 --> 31:31.421
[scoffs]

31:32.157 --> 31:33.490
Okay.

31:50.609 --> 31:53.977
-[knocking at door]
-I got it.

31:59.718 --> 32:00.984
Who is it?

32:05.257 --> 32:06.890
Some lady. Hide.

32:16.869 --> 32:18.468
Detective Conley, ma'am.

32:18.470 --> 32:19.536
Need to ask you
a few questions

32:19.538 --> 32:22.205
about your nephew,
Mr. Khalil Payne.

32:22.207 --> 32:23.407
[Yvette chuckles]

32:25.511 --> 32:28.011
Girl, it's a little too early
to be trick-or-treating.

32:28.013 --> 32:30.881
You know damn well
you ain't no detective.

32:30.883 --> 32:35.552
[chuckles] You're right,
why pretend?

32:35.554 --> 32:36.853
[screams]

32:43.362 --> 32:45.529
[both grunting]

33:04.116 --> 33:05.882
[grunting]

33:43.555 --> 33:45.489
[Khalil grunting]

33:51.997 --> 33:53.430
[Jennifer] Khalil!

34:20.392 --> 34:22.492
[Jennifer] Are you okay?
Are you hurt?

34:24.296 --> 34:25.462
Come on. Come on.

34:32.704 --> 34:35.005
[Cutter grunting]

34:42.614 --> 34:43.680
Go.

34:46.752 --> 34:49.286
[panting] Be careful. Careful.

35:06.905 --> 35:08.705
[beeping]

35:15.914 --> 35:19.182
-[drone whirring]
-[Jennifer panting]

35:26.892 --> 35:28.592
Leave us alone!

35:33.732 --> 35:35.065
Damn it!

35:37.803 --> 35:39.136
Come on.

35:51.416 --> 35:52.482
Where'd they go?

35:53.752 --> 35:56.586
Jen shot down my drone!
I got nothing.

35:57.156 --> 35:58.722
Damn!

35:58.723 --> 36:00.289
Okay, let's split up.
They couldn't have gone far.

36:00.292 --> 36:01.358
All right.

36:05.664 --> 36:06.696
[Khalil groans]

36:06.698 --> 36:07.764
[Jennifer] Who the hell
was that?

36:07.766 --> 36:09.499
[Khalil] I don't know.

36:09.501 --> 36:12.235
Wait, how did she find us?
We don't have any phones,

36:12.237 --> 36:14.838
and there's no navigation
in the...

36:14.840 --> 36:16.640
[Khalil grunting and panting]

36:17.843 --> 36:19.709
-Khalil...
-Huh?

36:20.812 --> 36:22.679
This lump on the back
of your head.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.414
What if Tobias put it there?

36:25.651 --> 36:26.817
What you mean,

36:26.818 --> 36:27.984
like a tracking device
or something?

36:27.986 --> 36:29.486
Yeah. Exactly.

36:32.824 --> 36:34.257
[crackling]

36:34.259 --> 36:37.227
See? I knew I felt something
extra the last time we kissed.

36:37.229 --> 36:38.929
My powers,
they must've caused
the tracker

36:38.931 --> 36:40.864
to have some sort of
electrical surge.

36:40.866 --> 36:42.532
Okay, all right. Um...

36:44.169 --> 36:46.770
All right, so what do we do
to get it out?

36:47.739 --> 36:48.805
Uh...

36:52.711 --> 36:54.611
-Okay.
-Wait, wait, no. Hell no.

36:54.613 --> 36:56.880
Uh-uh. You ain't
coming nowhere near me
with that thing.

36:56.882 --> 36:58.248
You got a better idea?

36:59.985 --> 37:03.920
All right, you said
that you were able to create

37:03.922 --> 37:05.255
an electrical surge, right?

37:05.257 --> 37:07.757
So what if you use your powers
to short it out?

37:07.759 --> 37:10.760
No, I can't do that.
I could seriously hurt you.

37:10.762 --> 37:13.163
Hey, I trust you.

37:16.001 --> 37:17.567
Let me test it out first.

37:25.277 --> 37:26.676
Okay, that won't do it.

37:31.283 --> 37:33.750
Uh... It'll be less than that.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.685
Wait, wait, wait...

37:38.323 --> 37:40.857
No, come on,
we gotta do it. Go.

37:41.994 --> 37:45.195
-You're right, I can't--
-No, do it.

37:46.932 --> 37:48.198
You can.

37:54.206 --> 37:58.441
You are the storm,
so you can control the storm.

38:00.812 --> 38:02.178
Wait.

38:04.082 --> 38:05.582
Remember...

38:07.085 --> 38:08.518
I don't care if I'm running...

38:19.965 --> 38:21.765
[crackles]

38:26.538 --> 38:28.238
Did it work?

38:32.210 --> 38:35.245
It must have. No electricity.

38:36.748 --> 38:37.914
The hell there ain't.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.226
Find anything?

38:50.228 --> 38:51.528
[Anissa over comms]
<i> No, we must've lost them.</i>

38:51.530 --> 38:52.662
[grunts]

39:04.142 --> 39:05.642
Jennifer?

39:28.967 --> 39:30.834
-[Jennifer] You good? Come on.
-Yeah.

39:32.104 --> 39:33.403
[Jennifer] Be careful.

39:43.048 --> 39:44.647
[cell phone vibrating]

39:47.252 --> 39:48.918
Tell me you have him.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.854
<i>Not yet, but it won't be long.</i>

39:53.592 --> 39:57.327
-[Tobias] You lost him.
-No. He's got a cut.

39:57.329 --> 39:59.829
They won't get far.
It's only a matter of time.

39:59.831 --> 40:01.514
I don't wanna hear all that.

40:01.515 --> 40:03.198
I don't give a damn
what you wanna hear.

40:03.201 --> 40:05.301
Your Casper-the-Ghost ass
just put me in a position

40:05.303 --> 40:07.470
to have to fight metas
without warning...

40:07.472 --> 40:08.338
Metas?

40:08.340 --> 40:09.873
<i> I didn't stutter.</i>

40:11.143 --> 40:12.342
Two of them showed up
at the house.

40:12.344 --> 40:14.677
<i> Black Lightning and Thunder.</i>

40:14.679 --> 40:16.813
Black Lightning?

40:16.815 --> 40:19.749
What the hell
does Black Lightning
want with Khalil?

40:20.285 --> 40:22.352
Or is it the Pierce girl?

40:24.523 --> 40:25.588
Hmm.

40:26.191 --> 40:27.891
Pierce girl again.

40:28.960 --> 40:31.327
Like at Club 100
and the Seahorse.

40:32.798 --> 40:33.863
Hmm.
