There we go, make
your momma proud.

00:15.515 --> 00:18.283
Hey, Larry, let's go
play some catch.

00:19.451 --> 00:21.519
Go throw the ball around.

00:21.521 --> 00:24.088
Get your mitt.
(PANTING)

00:24.090 --> 00:28.326
Larry, get your mitt,
let's go throw some...

00:28.328 --> 00:30.228
Let's go play some...
(SCREAMS)

00:30.230 --> 00:34.232
Jesus, Larry, you scared me.
Don't sneak up on me like that.

00:34.234 --> 00:36.467
Where's your...
(GASPS) Larry!

00:36.469 --> 00:39.270
Jesus, stop doing that.
You know I have a bad ticker.

00:39.272 --> 00:42.573
Now, where's your baseball,
let's find your baseball.

00:42.575 --> 00:44.308
Maybe it's under the...
(GASPS)

00:44.310 --> 00:46.644
How the hell did you
get under the bed?

00:46.646 --> 00:48.246
Come on, Larry.
Let's find your mitt.

00:48.248 --> 00:53.818
Where's your mitt? Let's stop horsing
around here, and let's go throw the ball.

00:53.820 --> 00:56.754
Where is that glove?
I don't see... What?

00:57.756 --> 01:01.361
Okay. Oh, my God.
I'm onto you. I'm onto you.

01:01.361 --> 01:03.127
You crazy little fucker.

01:03.129 --> 01:06.931
(GASPS) Stop doing this
to me, Larry.

01:07.633 --> 01:10.268
There's two of you.
(GASPS)

01:10.270 --> 01:15.006
I can't take any more.
I can't...

01:17.276 --> 01:18.910
(GROANING)

01:20.646 --> 01:22.814
But I ran.

01:23.549 --> 01:26.451
I ran so far away.

01:26.453 --> 01:30.788
I couldn't get away.

(HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING)

LARRY: How are you doing?
What are you doing?

02:08.895 --> 02:11.662
Just driving around,
filming people.

02:12.231 --> 02:15.333
LARRY: How are you doing?
Stop.

02:15.335 --> 02:17.802
Are you still here?
How are you doing?

02:17.804 --> 02:19.837
(LARRY WHISTLING)

02:25.911 --> 02:30.014
LARRY: How are you doing, man?
What's up?

02:34.453 --> 02:37.121
How you doing, dude?

02:37.389 --> 02:41.125
You get paid for this?
LARRY: No. For fun.

02:41.760 --> 02:45.563
Are you in high school or something?
No, 40 years old.

02:45.565 --> 02:47.532
LARRY: Where are you going?
You're acting weird

02:47.534 --> 02:49.967
LARRY: I'm not weird.

Hey, buddy!
What did you bench today?

03:01.414 --> 03:03.748
What the hell are you doing?
Huh?

03:03.750 --> 03:07.685
Get the...
Get out of here.

03:10.689 --> 03:12.757
LARRY: Hey, Roger,
you wanted to see me?

03:12.759 --> 03:15.359
Yeah, Larry.
You're fired.

03:15.361 --> 03:16.694
LARRY: Okay.
So...

03:16.696 --> 03:20.598
LARRY: How do you rate our date so far?
Do you film everything?

03:20.600 --> 03:24.001
Well, I wanted to
capture our first kiss.

03:24.069 --> 03:26.804
Oh! Uh...
(CLEARS THROAT)

03:26.806 --> 03:30.441

Oh. Really? Okay.

03:31.577 --> 03:34.478
Oh, Jesus. Okay.
You all right?

03:34.480 --> 03:35.479
Oh, my God.

03:35.481 --> 03:37.882
I'm meeting my girlfriend's
parents for the first time,

03:37.884 --> 03:41.085
and I just took the
biggest dump of my life.

03:41.286 --> 03:45.890

It won't flush. It won't flush.

everything okay in there?

03:51.230 --> 03:52.763
Huh?

03:53.031 --> 03:53.898
(FARTING) Ooh.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.968
LARRY: Today's the day
my girlfriend moves in.

03:56.970 --> 04:00.338
Hopefully she doesn't have
too many boxes.

04:00.906 --> 04:03.007
Hi, honey! How are you?

04:03.009 --> 04:05.042
Yes. Oh, God.

04:05.377 --> 04:06.911
(WHIMPERING)

04:07.813 --> 04:09.380
I think I lost the baby.

04:09.382 --> 04:14.018
LARRY: What?
I think I had a miscarriage.

04:14.020 --> 04:16.120
(GROANING)

04:23.061 --> 04:25.630
(SHOUTING)
Are you filming this?

04:32.604 --> 04:34.171
Better.

04:36.241 --> 04:40.044
LARRY: Okay, so this is the
house I inherited from Grandma.

04:40.046 --> 04:45.783
Those lanterns at the front
were from Paris. Stole 'em.

04:45.785 --> 04:48.152
You know,
if you come over here,

04:48.154 --> 04:51.822
I talked to a lot
of sculptors, and

04:51.824 --> 04:57.695
I wanted to capture the moment
that I discovered masturbation.

04:57.697 --> 05:00.097
That's a <i>Playboy</i> I'm reading,

05:00.099 --> 05:02.667
and a lot of times my dog, Rex,

05:02.669 --> 05:04.335
would watch me masturbate.

05:04.337 --> 05:08.606
It got so annoying that I'd have to
climb a tree just to get away from Rex,

05:08.608 --> 05:13.177
because it made me creepy
that he'd watch me.

05:13.179 --> 05:14.679
That is a desk

05:14.681 --> 05:16.981
my grandma actually died at.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.316
And we just kept it
the same way.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.919
This couch was a find.
I had it in college.

05:21.921 --> 05:23.354
Wiped the pee stains out of it.

05:23.356 --> 05:25.623
Oh, oh, these tusks are
an interesting story.

05:25.625 --> 05:31.362
I was in Mexico and I was drunk and I
hit an animal I didn't really know

05:31.364 --> 05:33.764
what it was,
but I cooked it up and ate it.

05:33.766 --> 05:36.133
And I think look
pretty darn good.

05:36.135 --> 05:37.535
Bitch getting that
through customs.

05:37.537 --> 05:39.704
This is our dining room.

05:39.706 --> 05:43.007
Oh, this is a nice,
interesting piece.

05:43.009 --> 05:47.412
This piece represents
the story of a small,

05:47.538 --> 05:51.414
black child in the
South, a slave,

05:51.716 --> 05:55.418
 making her way
North to safety

05:55.444 --> 05:57.541
in Harriet Tubman's
Underground Railroad.

05:58.724 --> 05:59.657
Interesting.

05:59.659 --> 06:00.991
This is the kitchen,

06:00.993 --> 06:02.893
where we do a lot of stuff.

06:02.895 --> 06:07.198
Over here is the fridge,
the refrigerator.

06:07.332 --> 06:11.535
This is where we do a lot
of our product placement.

06:11.537 --> 06:14.248
And come over here.
Oh, wait, go back.

06:14.274 --> 06:17.708
And this is great.
This is an interesting thing.

06:17.710 --> 06:18.442
Last night,

06:18.444 --> 06:23.581
I cooked the best cheese sandwich of
my life. I put it right up on top there.

06:23.583 --> 06:25.916
And the cheese
melted perfectly.

06:25.918 --> 06:30.488
The best thing I've ever had
in my life. This, uh...

06:30.956 --> 06:31.522
That's my pig.

06:31.524 --> 06:35.474
There's a paper mache replica
of my dog, Dog Byron.

06:35.500 --> 06:36.487
Good guy.

06:38.063 --> 06:40.164
And there's Cindy.

06:41.133 --> 06:42.633
Hmm.

06:42.768 --> 06:45.770
Watching her favorite TV show.

06:45.772 --> 06:46.570
Hmm.

06:46.572 --> 06:47.805
Here's the backyard.

06:47.807 --> 06:53.377
A lot of party going on out here. You bet.
We eat there, sometimes.

06:53.512 --> 06:55.379
This is the pool
and that's the...

06:55.381 --> 06:59.032
One-Eyed Willie cleans
the pool automatically.

06:59.058 --> 07:01.285
Don't have to do jack squat.

07:01.287 --> 07:03.387
That stop sign is
an interesting story.

07:03.389 --> 07:06.924
I plowed into that.
Once again, drunk.

07:06.926 --> 07:09.927
And rather than wait
for the cops, I took it.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.228
This is our bedroom.

07:11.230 --> 07:16.400
So this is where all the paranormal
activity has been happening.

07:16.402 --> 07:18.769
We've been hearing
a lot of loud bangs at night.

07:18.771 --> 07:19.603
(BANGING)
(SCREAMS)

07:19.605 --> 07:22.440
What was that?
I don't know. I just banged on the wall.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.307
Why'd the lights go out?

07:23.309 --> 07:27.745
Oh, I had
scream lights installed.

07:27.747 --> 07:28.646
(SCREAMS)

07:28.648 --> 07:30.581
They turn on and off
when you scream.

07:30.583 --> 07:36.420
Oh, well, let's just be really quiet
and see if we hear any odd noises.

07:36.422 --> 07:37.955
Okay.

07:39.324 --> 07:40.257
(SCREAMS)

07:40.259 --> 07:42.626
Why'd you scream now?

07:42.628 --> 07:43.527
I don't know.

07:43.529 --> 07:48.165
Good thing I can't get you to reach orgasm
or our lighting bill would be enormous.

07:48.167 --> 07:50.267
(TELEPHONE RINGS)
(BOTH SCREAMING)

07:50.269 --> 07:52.603
What is that?
What was that?

07:52.605 --> 07:55.873
I don't know.
Something happened.

07:56.208 --> 07:58.409
I heard something.

07:58.510 --> 08:01.278
LARRY: What was that?
I don't know. (GASPS)

08:01.280 --> 08:03.714
CINDY: No, it's okay. It's just my keys.
LARRY: Oh, boy.

08:03.716 --> 08:07.585
LARRY: Okay. Did you hear that?
CINDY: Shh.

08:07.587 --> 08:08.486
I mean, did you hear that?
Shh.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.889
Tell me. (SCREAMS)
It's okay. It's just a lamp.

08:11.891 --> 08:13.224
LARRY: Okay. Okay.

08:13.226 --> 08:18.195
I heard that. I heard something.
CINDY: Shh.

08:18.197 --> 08:22.700
(LARRY SCREAMS)
CINDY: It's okay, it's just Snooki.

08:23.468 --> 08:25.669
(BOTH SCREAMING)

08:25.671 --> 08:30.908
Larry, what are we gonna do?
Something is really strange in this house.

08:31.076 --> 08:34.477
(SIGHS) I'm just going
to keep on filming.

08:34.480 --> 08:37.982
Then, when we know exactly
what we're up against,

08:37.984 --> 08:40.518
we'll be in the
perfect place to

08:40.520 --> 08:42.052
take care of it!

08:42.054 --> 08:46.123
Oh, my God.
Are you all right?

08:46.224 --> 08:47.591
The battery's low.

08:47.593 --> 08:50.961
Oh, no, baby.
(KISSING SOUNDS)

08:50.963 --> 08:52.029
Looks like somebody...
You're so hot.

08:52.031 --> 08:56.767
Oh, no. Something's wrong with you.
I don't know what I'd do without you.

08:56.769 --> 08:59.670
I don't know
what I'd do without you.

08:59.771 --> 09:03.641
These are great green beans, Cindy.
Thank you.

09:03.643 --> 09:05.075
Wait. Who are you?

09:05.077 --> 09:08.245
Cindy refused to sleep with the
director, so he killed her off.

09:08.247 --> 09:12.449
I'm your new girlfriend, Katie.
Oh, right!

09:12.451 --> 09:14.685
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

09:16.821 --> 09:18.088
(CLATTERING)

09:18.090 --> 09:20.057
Did you hear that?
Yeah, I did. What is it?

09:20.059 --> 09:21.926
I don't know. It's coming
from the basement.

09:21.928 --> 09:23.275
KATIE: Baby, I'm scared.

09:23.301 --> 09:26.363
Don't worry about it.
Everything's going to be okay.

09:26.365 --> 09:28.699
I've got a camera.

09:33.138 --> 09:35.239
LARRY: Oh, it's William Katt.
Hey, Larry.

09:35.241 --> 09:38.342
I forgot. William Katt
lives in our basement.

09:38.344 --> 09:40.210
KATIE: Hi, Bill.
Hi. How are you?

09:40.212 --> 09:42.346
How could you forget, man?
LARRY: I'm sorry.

09:42.348 --> 09:47.351
Hey, Bill, I got a question. Have you
heard anything strange going on?

09:47.353 --> 09:49.520
We've been hearing weird noises

09:49.522 --> 09:54.291
and doors opening and closing
for no reason and stuff.

09:54.392 --> 09:55.926
Could be gnomes.
Gnomes?

09:55.928 --> 09:58.462
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, gnomes.
They're like little leprechauns.

09:58.464 --> 10:01.465
They get in through the walls.
They cause all kinds of problems.

10:01.467 --> 10:04.835
You gotta watch out for them.
Okay.

10:04.837 --> 10:08.772
Hey, do we have any strong
sedatives in the house?

10:08.774 --> 10:11.241
Sedatives?
Yeah, I need

10:11.243 --> 10:16.146
something that's gonna knock a
400-pound woman on her ass.

10:16.414 --> 10:19.350
I've been keeping this girl
down in the basement

10:19.352 --> 10:20.417
for about half a year,

10:20.419 --> 10:24.421
and I feed her nothing but 18
pounds of catfish every day.

10:24.423 --> 10:28.559
She's gotten so fat, she
can't even move anymore.

10:28.561 --> 10:31.795
She's completely dependent
on me to keep her alive.

10:31.797 --> 10:33.897
That's terrible.
Yeah.

10:33.899 --> 10:38.302
But, you know, when you've
been as famous as I have,

10:38.637 --> 10:39.336
for as long as I have,

10:39.338 --> 10:43.340
you've got to do whatever you can
to get your rocks off, right?

10:43.908 --> 10:49.346
What? Whoa! God damn it!
Look out! Look out!

10:49.348 --> 10:51.715
Whoa!
What?

10:53.451 --> 10:55.419
Did you see him?
LARRY & KATIE: What?

10:55.421 --> 10:57.187
The gnome?
LARRY: A gnome?

10:57.189 --> 10:59.089
KATIE: Gnome?
Oh, come on, Larry.

10:59.091 --> 11:01.525
You didn't see the gnome?
KATIE: No.

11:01.527 --> 11:03.360
BILL: It was right there.

11:03.362 --> 11:05.295
LARRY: I didn't see it.

11:05.297 --> 11:08.832
You know, I did a little angel
dust a little while ago.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.567
I don't know, maybe that's it.

11:10.569 --> 11:12.102
I think you dropped
something, Bill.

11:12.104 --> 11:14.705
LARRY: Yeah, you dropped something.
What's that?

11:14.707 --> 11:16.073
Is that...

11:16.075 --> 11:18.409
KATIE: Is that a finger?

11:18.411 --> 11:21.612
Oh... Oh, yes.

11:21.614 --> 11:24.748
Yes, indeed.
That is a finger.

11:25.183 --> 11:25.616
(CHUCKLES)

11:25.618 --> 11:30.854
I won this off a Somali pirate some years
ago in a game of five-finger fillet.

11:30.856 --> 11:35.726
Little bastards. Not nearly as good
with the blade as you'd think they are.

11:35.728 --> 11:38.429
Okay. All right.
Going back down to my basement.

11:38.431 --> 11:41.565
Goodbye. Goodbye, Larry.
Goodbye.

11:41.567 --> 11:42.866
LARRY: Good night.
BILL: Good night.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.234
KATIE: Good night, Bill.
BILL: Have a good one.

11:44.236 --> 11:45.398
LARRY: Have a good one. Jesus!

11:45.424 --> 11:46.870
BILL: God damn it!
Son of a bitch!

11:46.872 --> 11:50.808
LARRY: Look out! Look out.
BILL: Fuck. God damn!

11:51.409 --> 11:55.145
Watch out for those little fuckers, man.
LARRY: Okay.

11:55.147 --> 11:57.081
You can't be too careful.
LARRY: Okay.

11:57.083 --> 11:59.450
Okay?
LARRY: Yeah.

12:02.220 --> 12:03.153
LARRY: Love that guy.

12:03.155 --> 12:05.089
LARRY: Can we do
a sound test real quick?

12:05.091 --> 12:09.259
I want to see how good this mike is.
What should I do?

12:09.261 --> 12:11.962
Just whisper something creepy.

12:12.230 --> 12:14.298
(ANIMAL-LIKE GROWL)

12:14.866 --> 12:19.002
Okay. But this time try to speak up.
I'm testing the mike here.

12:19.004 --> 12:21.205
Okay. One more time.

12:21.940 --> 12:24.341
(ANIMAL-LIKE GROWL)

12:24.343 --> 12:26.143
LARRY: Okay, go ahead!

12:26.145 --> 12:27.478
(KATIE GROWLS ANIMALISTICALLY)

12:27.480 --> 12:31.648
Wow! This mike is really good.
It's like you're standing right...

12:31.650 --> 12:33.383
(ANIMAL-LIKE GROWL)

12:33.818 --> 12:36.286
Okay. That looks pretty good.

12:36.288 --> 12:37.855
Are you gonna have that
camera on every night now?

12:37.857 --> 12:41.558
We have to if we want to
catch this thing in action.

12:41.560 --> 12:45.529
All right. Camera man,
what do you think?

12:45.531 --> 12:49.266
I'm flying a 12K par on a
condor and a couple of 650s

12:49.268 --> 12:53.003
with CTB
for an ang light, nigga.

12:53.005 --> 12:56.774
Where do you want me, sir?
What scene number is this again?

12:58.109 --> 13:01.111
What was that?
LARRY: I don't know.

13:01.113 --> 13:02.813
Larry!

13:03.414 --> 13:05.616
(SHUSHING)

13:06.217 --> 13:08.685
It's coming from here.

13:09.788 --> 13:12.356
Wait! Composer?

13:14.359 --> 13:15.092
Yes, sir.

13:15.094 --> 13:19.363
Can I get a little scary
music swell here, please?

13:19.864 --> 13:21.965
Of course, sir.

13:25.136 --> 13:27.538
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)

13:27.540 --> 13:31.608
(SIGHS) Don't worry.
It's just a vibrator.

13:31.910 --> 13:33.343
Why would it go off on its own?

13:33.345 --> 13:37.447
I don't know. Must have
some sort of timer on it.

13:37.449 --> 13:40.184
Why would a vibrator
have a timer on it?

13:40.186 --> 13:41.218
I don't know.

13:41.220 --> 13:43.787
So you know when to
go (BLEEP) yourself?

13:43.789 --> 13:47.624
Hey, wait.
Why was that (BLEEP) bleeped?

13:47.626 --> 13:53.363
Because, sir, the distributors want
you to maintain a PG-13 rating.

13:53.365 --> 13:55.666
So I can't say (BLEEP)?
I'm afraid not.

13:55.668 --> 13:59.636
I can't say pig (BLEEP)?
No, you can't say that either.

13:59.638 --> 14:05.409
Well, what good does it do in a scary
movie if I can't say pig (BLEEP)?

14:06.544 --> 14:08.178
I'm sorry.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.781
But the script has a
gnarly decapitation scene

14:10.783 --> 14:14.551
where a paraplegic woman gets
raped and brutally murdered.

14:14.553 --> 14:16.157
Yeah, and that's fine.

14:16.183 --> 14:19.656
The MPAA doesn't care
about shocking violence

14:19.658 --> 14:22.660
as long as you don't
say any naughty words.

14:22.686 --> 14:23.586
I see.

14:29.767 --> 14:31.568
I feel better.

14:31.570 --> 14:33.804
What the (BLEEP)?

17:13.498 --> 17:16.967
Okay.
Nothing out of the ordinary.

17:19.771 --> 17:21.872
Yeah, just...

17:21.874 --> 17:25.075
Wait. Whoa.
Where's the clown?

17:26.711 --> 17:30.013
Oh, there he is.
(CHUCKLES)

17:30.581 --> 17:32.315
Yeah, no biggie, right?

17:32.317 --> 17:35.185
KATIE: No, seems
like a normal night.

17:35.753 --> 17:38.955
You know, I was thinking about calling
a psychic to help with our problem.

17:38.957 --> 17:42.893
We don't need a psychic for that.
The pump I ordered came in yesterday.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.395
No, not that problem.

17:45.397 --> 17:47.564
The problem with our
house being haunted.

17:47.566 --> 17:50.333
Oh! I know a great
psychic we could call.

17:50.335 --> 17:51.868
He's a waiter at
the dim sum place.

17:51.870 --> 17:54.271
He's always sticking
notes in my dessert.

17:54.273 --> 17:55.572
What does it say?

17:55.574 --> 17:58.108
"Cheer up,
it's only chlamydia."

17:58.110 --> 18:00.677
There's a lot of truth to that.
Yeah. A lot.

18:00.679 --> 18:03.413
Listen, Katie, this is
a serious matter.

18:03.415 --> 18:06.917
I don't think we can rely
on Chinese mumbo-jumbo.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.518
Okay, this is what we need.

18:08.520 --> 18:11.221
You mind zooming in here?
I don't feel like getting up.

18:11.223 --> 18:15.659
Okay. This guy's been a practicing
psychic for over 500 years.

18:15.661 --> 18:19.296
He even attended a psychic
retreat in India for two weeks.

18:19.298 --> 18:22.466
That's a foreign country.
Yeah. Exactly!

18:22.468 --> 18:25.368
For a one-time fee, he'll not
only communicate with spirits,

18:25.370 --> 18:28.872
but he'll also pop out
a dent in your car.

18:29.040 --> 18:33.543
Okay. We're just waiting
for our psychic to arrive.

18:40.985 --> 18:42.252
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

18:42.254 --> 18:43.420
Look at that.
Perfect timing.

18:43.422 --> 18:47.157
Not really. Wish that would have
happened about 10 seconds ago.

18:47.159 --> 18:49.493
But here we go.

18:49.827 --> 18:51.561
Hi.
Hi, there, folks.

18:51.563 --> 18:53.897
We are going door to door
doing missionary work

18:53.899 --> 18:55.031
for the Church of
the Latter-day Saints.

18:55.033 --> 18:58.865
We'd like to share our
message of peace and love.

18:58.891 --> 19:02.539
Here, take a pamphlet.
It just says, "Fuck the Jews."

19:02.541 --> 19:05.542
LARRY: Oh, you know what?
We're already fans of Mel Gibson,

19:05.544 --> 19:07.310
but we appreciate it.
Thanks for coming.

19:07.312 --> 19:11.549
Hold on a minute. Hold on, Larry.
Hold on. Hold on.

19:15.019 --> 19:17.053
These folks are
from the Mormon church.

19:17.055 --> 19:18.922
The Mormon church, right?
That's right.

19:18.924 --> 19:20.190
Yes, yes.
We are.

19:20.192 --> 19:23.260
Well, that is wonderful.
Absolutely wonderful.

19:23.262 --> 19:25.295
I want to hear all about it, all right?
Great.

19:25.297 --> 19:29.432
Let's go down into the basement,
and we can talk down there.

19:29.434 --> 19:32.135
I have so many questions.
Great.

19:32.137 --> 19:33.670
Okay, let's go, all right.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.005
Hey, let me ask you something.

19:35.007 --> 19:38.308
Do you know how to
get semen out of cat fur?

19:38.310 --> 19:40.944
'Cause I have been
trying for the longest time.

19:40.946 --> 19:46.950
You know...
And I used baby powder and detergent.

19:46.952 --> 19:48.285
(WHISPERS) Where's our cat?

19:48.287 --> 19:50.453
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

19:51.522 --> 19:52.255
Hi!
KATIE: Hi.

19:52.257 --> 19:54.157
I'm Dr. Lipschitz.
KATIE: Nice to meet you.

19:54.159 --> 19:55.959
Good to meet you, too, darling.

19:55.961 --> 19:58.428
So, why we're here.

19:58.430 --> 20:02.832
You think something paranormal

20:03.334 --> 20:05.936
is occurring
within this residence.

20:05.938 --> 20:08.205
Yes, there's been lots
of odd things happening,

20:08.207 --> 20:10.407
with wall noises,
doors squeaking,

20:10.409 --> 20:13.276
lights switching on and off,
dildos turning on...

20:13.278 --> 20:13.944
Yes!

20:13.946 --> 20:15.745
(BUZZING)
(CHUCKLES)

20:15.747 --> 20:21.017
You certainly have some type
of presence here. Nice pink.

20:21.118 --> 20:21.818
(BUZZING STOPS)

20:21.820 --> 20:23.453
What will happen to us, Doctor?

20:23.455 --> 20:27.324
Well, the events you
have been describing

20:27.326 --> 20:30.994
are going to slowly get worse.

20:31.262 --> 20:31.795
LARRY: Why?

20:31.797 --> 20:34.197
Ghosts know formula.
Mmm-hmm. I mean,

20:34.199 --> 20:38.735
for the first, like, 45 minutes, they'll
slam doors and whisper your name.

20:38.737 --> 20:41.771
But then things will escalate,

20:41.773 --> 20:44.174
and the last 10 minutes

20:44.176 --> 20:45.942
should be quite compelling.

20:45.944 --> 20:48.878
But, Doctor, why is this ghost
after us? What does it want?

20:48.880 --> 20:53.271
Well, I believe Larry
knows the answer to that.

20:53.297 --> 20:54.943
Don't you, Larry?

20:56.153 --> 20:57.454
Larry?

20:57.456 --> 20:59.222
LARRY: Well, it's true.

20:59.224 --> 21:02.659
It all happened
when I was 15 years old.

21:02.661 --> 21:05.795
I had an imaginary friend
named Toby,

21:05.797 --> 21:07.564
and Toby and I would...
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

21:07.566 --> 21:10.467
Oh, my God. If we're going
to have a flashback moment,

21:10.469 --> 21:12.936
somebody else ought to
be behind the camera.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.504
I mean, really,
where's the dramatic effect

21:14.506 --> 21:16.840
with you on the wrong side
of the lens?

21:16.842 --> 21:21.111
He's got a point.
I'm filled with points.

21:25.950 --> 21:29.185
Well, yeah, this is...
This is better.

21:29.187 --> 21:30.787
Um, okay.

21:30.789 --> 21:35.558
It all started
when I was 14 years old.

21:36.193 --> 21:39.896
My dad had just passed away
from alcohol poisoning.

21:39.898 --> 21:44.134
He drank 144
non-alcoholic beers.

21:44.935 --> 21:46.303
That's a gross.

21:46.305 --> 21:47.937
KATIE: That is gross.

21:47.939 --> 21:50.407
No... Never mind.

21:50.409 --> 21:53.443
My stepdad used to like
to videotape me at night.

21:53.445 --> 21:57.514
He even went so far as to put
a video camera in my room.

21:57.516 --> 21:58.782
<i>I could never figure out why.</i>

21:58.784 --> 22:02.952
LARRY'S STEPDAD: All right.
Let's have some dancing

22:02.954 --> 22:03.620
(MUSIC PLAYING)

22:03.622 --> 22:07.891
Oh, yeah.
Oh, dance the night away!

22:07.893 --> 22:11.027
Oh, get into it.
Go, Larry!

22:13.964 --> 22:15.899
Yeah. All right.

22:15.901 --> 22:20.570
It's bed time.
Why don't you put on your PJs?

22:21.005 --> 22:21.438
Yeah.

22:21.440 --> 22:22.022
These ones?

22:22.048 --> 22:24.140
Oh, no, no, no. Not those.
Not those.

22:24.142 --> 22:27.577
Let's, uh,
put the training ones on.

22:27.579 --> 22:28.912
Yeah.
This one?

22:28.914 --> 22:31.514
Oh, yeah.
Oh, those are steamy.

22:31.516 --> 22:34.851
Oh, you know, because of the
locomotives. (CLEARS THROAT)

22:34.853 --> 22:36.519
Because there's trains on them.

22:36.521 --> 22:38.922
LARRY: <i>I had an imaginary
friend named Toby.</i>

22:38.924 --> 22:42.625
<i>And at night we would play
different games together.</i>

22:42.627 --> 22:43.426
One hundred...

22:43.428 --> 22:46.629
<i>I taught him how to
play hide and seek.</i>

22:46.631 --> 22:47.131
Found you!

22:47.132 --> 22:50.066
<i>He taught me how to get
high smoking catnip.</i>

22:50.068 --> 22:51.034
Meow!

22:51.036 --> 22:54.437
<i>I showed him how to
give cool handshakes.</i>

22:54.439 --> 22:58.475
<i>And he taught me how to
autoerotic asphyxiate.</i>

22:58.477 --> 23:01.811
<i>My stepfather had set up a
camera in our living room</i>

23:01.813 --> 23:04.481
<i>mounted to an oscillating fan.</i>

23:04.982 --> 23:07.784
<i>Mostly for his own amusement.</i>

23:07.786 --> 23:08.785
<i>You know, looking back at it,</i>

23:08.787 --> 23:11.755
<i>I don't know why anyone would
want to document themselves</i>

23:11.757 --> 23:14.090
<i>doing mountains of cocaine.</i>

23:14.092 --> 23:16.259
<i>But, hey, that was my stepdad.</i>

23:16.261 --> 23:18.361
<i>He had his ways.</i>

23:35.546 --> 23:37.247
(GROANS)

23:38.349 --> 23:40.316
It got worse two days later.

23:40.318 --> 23:43.052
My stepdad came into my room
to play a game of catch

23:43.054 --> 23:47.223
and next thing I know I was
being questioned by the police.

23:47.225 --> 23:53.263
Apparently his brains and his
hemorrhoids exploded simultaneously.

23:53.431 --> 23:55.799
He died instantly.

23:55.801 --> 23:58.668
And, you know,

23:58.803 --> 24:01.871
I just knew it had to be Toby.

24:02.039 --> 24:03.773
(SNORING)

24:11.549 --> 24:12.615
(CHUCKLING)

24:12.617 --> 24:15.885
I woke myself snoring.
Excuse me.

24:16.253 --> 24:18.154
KATIE: It sounds like
Larry was possessed.

24:18.156 --> 24:20.757
Can you help us, Doctor?
I'm afraid I can't, Katie.

24:20.759 --> 24:26.129
What I sensed when I walked in here and
what Larry has now just confirmed,

24:26.530 --> 24:30.300
this is not a ghost
we're dealing with, honey.

24:30.302 --> 24:33.136
This is a demon.

24:33.838 --> 24:34.537
What's the difference?

24:34.539 --> 24:37.106
Well, a ghost will sell you
crack on a street corner.

24:37.108 --> 24:40.610
But a demon will wash your
crack and sell it back to you.

24:40.612 --> 24:45.215
No, I'm sorry. That's
a drug dealer and a hooker.

24:45.217 --> 24:47.250
This is terrible.
I know it is, Katie.

24:47.252 --> 24:48.751
The jokes are stale,
the plot unoriginal,

24:48.753 --> 24:50.954
but nothing
we can do about it, so...

24:50.956 --> 24:53.957
I suggest we do what
Brendan Fraser does.

24:53.959 --> 24:57.794
Take that money and run.
Maybe there's something we can do.

24:57.796 --> 25:00.396
Should we move
out of the house?

25:00.398 --> 25:02.799
No, I'm afraid that won't
work either, Larry, you see,

25:02.801 --> 25:05.468
this demon is attached to you,
so if you leave this house,

25:05.470 --> 25:07.170
it ain't gonna
make a difference.

25:07.172 --> 25:08.338
I suggest you stay here.

25:08.340 --> 25:12.308
Plus, save you a bundle
on below-the-line budget.

25:12.310 --> 25:12.876
Mmm-hmm.

25:12.878 --> 25:15.144
Well, I mean, should we try
to communicate with it?

25:15.146 --> 25:17.313
I mean, find out what it wants?

25:17.315 --> 25:18.281
Hmm.

25:18.283 --> 25:20.483
No, I don't recommend
that either. You see,

25:20.485 --> 25:24.053
when you start to communicate
with this kind of creature,

25:24.055 --> 25:27.056
you open the door for it
to come on in.

25:27.058 --> 25:28.858
So we should just do nothing?
Mmm-hmm.

25:28.860 --> 25:32.762
Yeah. Absolutely nothing.
We should do absolutely nothing.

25:32.764 --> 25:34.697
And end the movie right here.

25:38.168 --> 25:40.670
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

25:42.806 --> 25:45.408
Never mind. I got nothing.

25:46.510 --> 25:49.279
No, wait, wait, wait.
There is an alternative.

25:49.281 --> 25:52.482
Oh, yes. Here we are.

25:52.850 --> 25:54.117
Okay.

41:19.743 --> 41:24.179
That's just the demon, honey.
Go back to bed.

41:24.581 --> 41:26.648
Larry, I'm scared.

41:26.650 --> 41:29.685
Well, then go down
and check it out!

41:29.687 --> 41:30.352
You're the man!

41:30.354 --> 41:34.223
I expect you to investigate
creepy sounds. Come on!

41:34.225 --> 41:36.291
(GRUNTING)
God! Ow!

41:36.293 --> 41:37.459
Larry!

41:37.461 --> 41:38.060
All right!

41:38.062 --> 41:41.530
Boy, first you want the vote,
then you want equal wages.

41:41.532 --> 41:44.800
Why don't you go down and
check out creepy sounds?

41:44.802 --> 41:45.701
Larry.

41:45.703 --> 41:47.936
Do you have to
bring the camera?

41:47.938 --> 41:49.938
LARRY: Yes, I do.

42:00.216 --> 42:01.517
Hey! What the hell?

42:01.519 --> 42:03.252
LARRY: Hey, what are you
doing in here?

42:03.254 --> 42:04.887
I'm making a
found-footage film.

42:04.889 --> 42:07.089
LARRY: No, I'm making
a found-footage film!

42:07.091 --> 42:08.090
I was doing it first.

42:08.092 --> 42:08.857
Well, mine's a spoof!

42:08.859 --> 42:12.361
Well, I was making spoofs when you were
pooping your diapers, you little fart.

42:12.363 --> 42:15.230
Besides, I starred
in a Zucker film.

42:15.232 --> 42:17.366
I starred in a Zucker film.

42:17.767 --> 42:19.768
Look, get out of my house.
Get out of my movie.

42:19.770 --> 42:21.570
That doesn't count.
You get out of my movie.

42:21.572 --> 42:23.539
Get out of my movie!
Get out of my movie!

42:23.541 --> 42:24.406
You get out of my movie.

42:24.408 --> 42:26.642
Get out of my movie!
You get out of my movie...

42:26.644 --> 42:29.011
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

42:31.214 --> 42:34.483
Did somebody call
for a demon hunter?

42:34.884 --> 42:35.617
LARRY: I don't think so.

42:35.619 --> 42:40.122
Well, with the economy being in the
toilet, I was sure hoping to find a job.

42:40.124 --> 42:42.691
I'm so happy you're here.
We haven't slept all night.

42:42.693 --> 42:46.094
Well, you know what you should do is
take a light walk before bedtime.

42:46.096 --> 42:50.599
It boosts serotonin levels
and promotes relaxation.

42:51.234 --> 42:54.770
LARRY: Is that some sort
of ghost hunting tool?

42:54.772 --> 42:55.537
No, it's a cell phone.

42:55.539 --> 42:59.675
I got a new app that locates Christian
singles in the neighborhood.

42:59.677 --> 43:03.378
There's a real cutie
about four doors down.

43:03.380 --> 43:05.747
Catholic girls like to do anal.

43:05.749 --> 43:06.548
(CAMERA CLICKS)

43:06.550 --> 43:11.153
Yeah. I think your place
is definitely haunted.

43:11.155 --> 43:13.021
How can you be sure?

43:13.023 --> 43:14.923
I've got a sixth sense.

43:14.925 --> 43:15.891
You can see ghosts?

43:15.893 --> 43:19.595
No, but I can communicate
with household pets.

43:19.597 --> 43:21.897
Your goldfish is
definitely depressed

43:21.899 --> 43:24.266
and probably seen a demon.

43:24.734 --> 43:25.267
What can we do?

43:25.269 --> 43:29.504
Well, he could do with a little of this.
There you go, fishy.

43:29.506 --> 43:33.375
She should be better in
the morning. That's for sure.

43:34.744 --> 43:38.413
Yeah. She'll get much
better in the morning.

43:38.415 --> 43:42.351
Where's my manners?
My name's Goff.

43:42.452 --> 43:43.285
Jack Goff.

43:43.287 --> 43:44.786
LARRY: Ah. Nope, no way.

43:44.788 --> 43:47.522
My friends call me Jack.
You can call me Jack.

43:47.524 --> 43:50.459
LARRY: What do
your enemies call you?

43:50.526 --> 43:53.428
Inmate 2571044.

43:56.466 --> 43:59.368
But that's in the past,
God willing.

43:59.370 --> 44:04.539
Listen, I don't mind you filming me, but
I'm not going to sign any release forms.

44:04.541 --> 44:08.543
Ever since I did <i>Corky Romano,</i>
<i>I've been a little cautious.</i>

44:08.545 --> 44:09.544
LARRY: How do we proceed here?

44:09.546 --> 44:13.582
I'd like to walk around a bit.
Get a lay of the land.

44:13.584 --> 44:14.683
LARRY: Have you ever
done this before?

44:14.685 --> 44:16.918
Walking? Sure. Ever since
I was three years old.

44:16.920 --> 44:19.921
I'd like to think
I'm pretty good at it.

44:19.923 --> 44:23.892
LARRY: No. Demon hunting.
(SHUSHING)

44:23.894 --> 44:25.994
You hear that?

44:26.195 --> 44:28.096
No.
LARRY: No.

44:28.098 --> 44:29.531
Neither do I.

44:29.533 --> 44:30.966
Quick! Go to night vision.

44:30.968 --> 44:33.001
It's going to make it seem
a lot more suspenseful,

44:33.003 --> 44:34.736
when actually I'm just gonna
monolog about my history.

44:34.738 --> 44:39.541
I've been hunting ghosts and dealing
with the paranormal for years now.

44:39.543 --> 44:40.609
It all started way back when,

44:40.611 --> 44:44.179
when I auditioned for this reality
TV show and I landed the lead.

44:44.181 --> 44:47.716
I thought you looked familiar. You
were on that show <i>Demon Hunters.</i>

44:47.718 --> 44:50.118
One and the same.
26 episodes.

44:50.120 --> 44:52.087
Yeah, they had me
going all over the world.

44:52.089 --> 44:55.757
Chasing down ghosts
and haunted houses and such.

44:55.759 --> 44:56.925
LARRY: I thought
that stuff was bogus.

44:56.927 --> 45:02.764
There's nothing bogus about a 2.7 ratings
share on a Wednesday night, sir.

45:03.533 --> 45:04.733
Yeah, we made it all up.

45:04.735 --> 45:11.707
Yeah, after three years of pretending
to hear doors creak and ghosts talk,

45:11.709 --> 45:13.875
something really
strange happened.

45:13.877 --> 45:16.311
LARRY: You started
hearing them for real?

45:16.313 --> 45:18.313
No. We got canceled.

45:18.315 --> 45:19.514
LARRY: Oh, I'm sorry.

45:19.516 --> 45:20.649
It's all right.

45:20.651 --> 45:24.086
Yeah, I got pretty
depressed here for a while.

45:24.088 --> 45:27.856
Kept hearing voices in my head
going, "You're an idiot, Jack.

45:27.858 --> 45:28.924
"You're a loser, Jack.

45:28.926 --> 45:31.827
"You're a loser. Loser.
You're a loser."

45:35.331 --> 45:39.267
At first, I thought
it was my intuition.

45:39.269 --> 45:44.673
But then my intuition was telling
me it wasn't my intuition.

45:47.310 --> 45:49.244
It was a demon.

45:50.613 --> 45:53.782
So ever since then, I've
been using my powers to...

45:53.784 --> 45:55.217
Help all mankind?

45:55.219 --> 45:57.452
(SCOFFING) What? No.

45:57.454 --> 45:58.687
To try to build
an audience back,

45:58.689 --> 46:02.457
so I can get back on a reality
TV show where I belong.

46:02.459 --> 46:03.492
Jesus.

46:03.494 --> 46:04.760
(GASPS)

46:04.762 --> 46:06.428
It senses me.

46:06.430 --> 46:10.198
Oh, it senses me, all right.

46:10.200 --> 46:11.666
Yeah.

46:12.602 --> 46:13.835
You feel that?

46:13.837 --> 46:17.906
It senses me, and it
doesn't like what it...

46:17.908 --> 46:19.441
(SHOUTS)

46:19.443 --> 46:21.343
(GROANING)

46:23.646 --> 46:24.246
Didn't spill a drop.

46:24.248 --> 46:29.050
I'm okay. I think we should
check out your bedroom next.

46:29.986 --> 46:32.921
So is this the room where most
of the disturbances happen?

46:32.923 --> 46:34.990
Yeah. A lot of them
do happen in here.

46:34.992 --> 46:37.259
Yeah. Yeah. I can feel it.

46:37.261 --> 46:39.461
I'm feeling stuff.

46:39.896 --> 46:43.298
It's kind of like a tingling sensation.
Who's that whore?

46:43.300 --> 46:46.301
LARRY: What?
That's my Aunt Linda.

46:46.303 --> 46:47.936
Yeah. I'm feeling,
like, a heat.

46:47.938 --> 46:52.073
Kind of a tingling, tingling feel.
I don't know.

46:52.075 --> 46:54.910
Oh! They like to possess
stuffed animals a lot.

46:54.912 --> 46:58.647
You know what, that's my grandmother's.
Can you not...

46:58.649 --> 46:59.714
Pop. Pop.
Hey!

46:59.716 --> 47:01.449
Get over it.
She's dead.

47:01.451 --> 47:02.450
She's not dead.

47:02.452 --> 47:03.118
She will be.

47:03.120 --> 47:07.756
All right. They like to
creep into walls sometimes.

47:08.057 --> 47:10.192
Feel them out.

47:10.194 --> 47:11.459
LARRY: What is that thing?

47:11.461 --> 47:15.730
That's a, uh...
It's an imaging, uh...

47:15.732 --> 47:17.199
You hear stuff with it.

47:17.201 --> 47:19.201
It's a hearing device.

47:19.203 --> 47:21.536
It looks like a stethoscope.
LARRY: Yeah.

47:21.538 --> 47:24.706
It's getting warm.
It's a warm kind of a feeling that I...

47:24.708 --> 47:25.640
You know what, can you not...

47:25.642 --> 47:28.428
It's okay, Katie. I'm a
professional ghost hunter.

47:28.454 --> 47:29.411
You know what...

47:29.413 --> 47:31.313
Oh, ho, ho! Bingo!

47:31.315 --> 47:35.684
Look what we got here.
The possession of a vampire,

47:35.686 --> 47:36.718
Count Juggula!

47:36.720 --> 47:37.786
LARRY: You know what,

47:37.788 --> 47:40.088
I don't think that's
appropriate at all.

47:40.090 --> 47:43.058
All right. Jeez,
I was just kidding around.

47:43.060 --> 47:46.528
All right, where's your
bathroom anyway?

47:46.596 --> 47:48.496
(SHIVERING)

47:49.565 --> 47:51.366
Got a little dribble.

47:51.368 --> 47:51.800
(SNIFFING)

47:51.802 --> 47:53.301
Yeah, I'd wash
that if I were you.

47:53.303 --> 47:55.570
All right.
LARRY: You were in there for a while.

47:55.572 --> 47:58.974
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Focus up.
Let's get to work.

47:58.976 --> 48:02.577
All right, let's do
a little peeping.

48:03.579 --> 48:05.680
Got anything? Nothing.

48:05.682 --> 48:08.149
Hope I didn't lose him.

48:08.384 --> 48:11.786
Nothing there. Damn it!

48:11.788 --> 48:13.822
Where, oh, where could you be?

48:13.824 --> 48:16.358
Oh, yeah,
I'm getting something.

48:16.360 --> 48:20.362
Yeah, it's big.
It's real big.

48:21.330 --> 48:23.431
I'm getting a rod.
(LAUGHING)

48:23.433 --> 48:25.100
LARRY: All right,
that's enough!

48:25.102 --> 48:27.802
Hey, man. It's cool.
We're cool, right?

48:27.804 --> 48:29.671
LARRY: Yeah. Come on, Goff.

48:29.673 --> 48:32.207
JACK: All right. This is what's
called a thermal imaging camera.

48:32.209 --> 48:36.478
Let's just scan the area for
anything out of the ordinary.

48:36.480 --> 48:37.612
How does this thing work?

48:37.614 --> 48:39.781
JACK: I got no ideas.
I just like the pretty colors.

48:39.783 --> 48:42.371
Just stand over there.
Let me get a reading.

48:42.397 --> 48:43.018
Okay.

48:43.020 --> 48:45.487
Right here?
Okay.

48:45.755 --> 48:46.288
(FARTS)

48:46.290 --> 48:48.757
Good God!
I got a reading. I got a reading.

48:48.759 --> 48:49.758
What? Where?
(FARTS)

48:49.760 --> 48:53.028
Jesus. This thing's amazing.
What? What do you see?

48:53.030 --> 48:57.732
God dang it!
I lost him. I lost him.

48:57.934 --> 48:58.767
Wait. Wait.
(FARTS)

48:58.769 --> 49:00.869
I think it's trying to
communicate with us.

49:00.871 --> 49:02.437
Well, okay, what is it saying?

49:02.439 --> 49:04.139
I'm not sure.
The message may be too advanced

49:04.141 --> 49:06.141
for our feeble human
minds to comprehend.

49:06.143 --> 49:07.831
Ah, damn it! I lost him.

49:07.857 --> 49:10.947
We know where you are,
you son of a bitch!

49:12.149 --> 49:13.348
(FARTS)

49:13.350 --> 49:15.050
I brought in a cognitive
psychologist

49:15.052 --> 49:18.653
to help relate to your
demon you got there, Larry.

49:18.655 --> 49:21.856
I'm Dr. Luni.
But you can call me Ima.

49:21.858 --> 49:23.591
Ima Luni.

49:23.593 --> 49:25.961
Sounds like you're the guy
I'm here to see.

49:25.963 --> 49:27.662
(CHUCKLING)

49:28.130 --> 49:31.733
Pretty hot for a doctor,
right, honey? I mean, wow.

49:31.735 --> 49:34.302
KATIE: Larry, get to the point.
Right. No.

49:34.304 --> 49:36.071
So tell me what you're seeing.

49:36.073 --> 49:38.807
Yeah, you know.
I've been living in the house.

49:38.809 --> 49:43.945
It's just been weird that all of
sudden I get taken over by a demon.

49:43.947 --> 49:45.280
I think it's got to be a demon,

49:45.282 --> 49:50.485
'cause it makes me say stuff and
do things I would never do.

49:50.487 --> 49:53.822
But it takes over me and I
don't know how to stop...

49:53.824 --> 49:55.724
(GURGLING)

49:56.292 --> 49:58.693
This is the demon
inside of Larry!

49:58.695 --> 50:01.329
And he's thinking
that you're pretty hot,

50:01.331 --> 50:06.001
and maybe you, Katie and me could go
out to dinner and drinks sometime

50:06.003 --> 50:10.739
and maybe get to know each other
and fool around, I don't know.

50:10.741 --> 50:15.610
Whoa, God! It happened.
It happened.

50:15.778 --> 50:17.045
What did it say?

50:17.047 --> 50:20.382
Nothing. He just
introduced himself.

50:20.583 --> 50:22.584
Oh, that's... That's weird.

50:22.586 --> 50:23.918
Usually he's
a lot more forward.

50:23.920 --> 50:29.958
He's a demon, he's kind of a dick...
He didn't say anything?

50:29.960 --> 50:31.526
Nope.

50:32.395 --> 50:36.998
Get the cotton out of your ears, you dummy!
I'm talking about fucking!

50:37.000 --> 50:41.503
I'm a demon, let's get it on.
You, me and Katie! Come on, baby.

50:41.505 --> 50:43.905
I can fuck all night,
I can fuck all night.

50:43.907 --> 50:49.477
Whoa, man. Oh, boy.
Felt that one. That was a big one.

50:49.479 --> 50:50.779
What'd he say?

50:50.781 --> 50:54.282
He gave me a recipe
for chocolate chip cookies.

50:54.284 --> 50:56.418
Cookies?
Yeah.

50:56.420 --> 50:57.919
Oh, that's bizarre.

50:57.921 --> 51:02.657
Weird. Sometimes he says
stuff that's really rude.

51:04.226 --> 51:08.430
I'm talking about a threesome, you
dumbass. I'm talking about me...

51:08.432 --> 51:12.634
I'm talking about a foursome.
Me, you, Katie and you.

51:12.636 --> 51:16.971
We all get it on.
We'll go upstairs and watch dirty movies,

51:16.973 --> 51:20.575
get in the bathtub,
put some hot lotion on us.

51:20.577 --> 51:22.944
We can jerk it and suck it
and fuck it all night.

51:22.946 --> 51:27.382
Sticking fingers in holes, you get
it front side, I'll get backside,

51:27.384 --> 51:32.287
up top and we're going to get
to town and... (GRUNTING)

51:33.089 --> 51:36.758
Whoa. My goodness.
I got possessed.

51:36.760 --> 51:37.425
I think I had your guy!

51:37.427 --> 51:41.830
No, I don't think you did, because she's the
doctor and I know it doesn't jump people.

51:41.832 --> 51:42.931
No, it does.
I'm a demon hunter

51:42.933 --> 51:46.668
and this one, I think he was
Italian and really strong.

51:46.670 --> 51:49.846
No, I don't think it was,
'cause I don't think...

51:49.872 --> 51:50.672
My demon...

51:50.674 --> 51:53.436
The fuck are you doing, Goff?
Get the hell outta here!

51:53.462 --> 51:55.043
This is my thing going on here.

51:55.045 --> 51:58.680
Why do you have to be so selfish
all the time, for God's sake?

51:58.682 --> 52:00.048
I'll just sit in the corner
and whack off.

52:00.050 --> 52:02.784
What the fuck?
I don't want to see you whack off!

52:02.786 --> 52:04.152
My dick won't even
touch your dick!

52:04.154 --> 52:06.020
I don't wanna see
your fucking dick!

52:06.022 --> 52:08.389
Wait! Stop! Enough!

52:08.391 --> 52:09.524
(GROANING)

52:09.526 --> 52:11.392
(DEMONIC VOICE) Oh, my goodness!
I'm going to hit you!

52:11.394 --> 52:13.928
I'm going to fucking kill you,
you fucking psychos!

52:13.930 --> 52:16.097
I fucking can't stand
the two of you!

52:16.099 --> 52:20.034
I'm going to fucking pepper
spray both of you!

52:21.704 --> 52:23.071
Whoa.

52:23.073 --> 52:25.340
What just happened?
That was so weird.

52:25.342 --> 52:28.076
I feel like I was possessed!

52:28.310 --> 52:29.511
What did I say?

52:29.513 --> 52:31.646
BOTH: You said you wanted
to have sex with...

52:31.648 --> 52:33.214
Me.
Us.

52:33.216 --> 52:35.517
No, me.
Us. All of us.

52:35.519 --> 52:37.352
(BOTH GROANING)

52:37.686 --> 52:40.688
My demon has a big dick,
did I tell you that?

52:40.690 --> 52:41.723
Shut up, Goff.

52:41.725 --> 52:44.292
KATIE: Nice one, guys.

52:44.294 --> 52:45.927
That was a bust. Jeez.

52:45.929 --> 52:47.629
Hey, I was possessed.
Well...

52:47.631 --> 52:49.464
I was possessed.
Yeah. Me...

52:49.466 --> 52:50.632
KATIE: Sure, Larry.

52:50.634 --> 52:52.000
I was, Katie.

52:52.002 --> 52:52.767
(GROANS)

52:52.769 --> 52:53.568
We still got, Katie.

52:53.570 --> 52:55.904
We could probably get a threesome going.
Shut up, Goff!

52:55.906 --> 52:57.338
Come on, jeez.

52:57.873 --> 52:59.641
Well, that was a bust, huh?
Sorry.

52:59.643 --> 53:01.409
KATIE: Can we please figure
out how to talk to this demon?

53:01.411 --> 53:03.311
Hey, you want to put
a sock in it, hot pants?

53:03.313 --> 53:04.512
Big boys are talking here.

53:04.514 --> 53:05.446
Whoa, hang on a minute.

53:05.448 --> 53:07.949
All right, all right.
Sorry about that.

53:07.951 --> 53:11.553
All right, listen.
Demon! Demon!

53:11.555 --> 53:15.857
Demon, I'm trying to communicate
with you right now, listen up!

53:15.859 --> 53:16.291
Um...

53:16.293 --> 53:21.362
I know you're a supernatural being
and probably prefer to communicate

53:21.364 --> 53:25.166
through grunts or
unidentifiable noises.

53:25.168 --> 53:26.568
So let's keep this simple.

53:26.570 --> 53:30.371
One grunt means "yes,"
two grunts mean "no."

53:30.373 --> 53:31.773
How does that sound?

53:31.775 --> 53:33.141
(DEMON GRUNTS TWICE)

53:33.143 --> 53:36.644
Okay, I think I just got
a "yes" and another "yes."

53:36.646 --> 53:39.447
This is going great.
Okay!

53:39.449 --> 53:41.749
We're on a roll here.

53:41.751 --> 53:44.285
Demon, um...

53:44.486 --> 53:46.487
Can you see us?

53:46.722 --> 53:48.289
(DEMON GRUNTS)

53:48.291 --> 53:50.325
All right. This is great.

53:50.327 --> 53:55.096
Demon, are you
the only presence here?

53:55.664 --> 53:57.365
(DEMON GRUNTS)

53:57.367 --> 53:58.866
All right.

53:58.868 --> 54:03.771
Demon, have you been
with Larry all his life?

54:04.406 --> 54:06.007
(DEMON GRUNTS)

54:06.009 --> 54:08.109
Oh, okay.

54:08.477 --> 54:12.447
Hey, Demon, have you
ever, like, sharted?

54:12.982 --> 54:14.115
DEMON: Uh-huh.

54:14.117 --> 54:16.317
Oh, man, I knew it!

54:16.319 --> 54:17.085
I shart all the time.

54:17.087 --> 54:20.955
I sharted on the way over here, that's why
I asked, 'cause my underwear is full.

54:20.957 --> 54:21.956
KATIE: Enough
with the sharting.

54:21.958 --> 54:24.292
All right, honey,
I had a question, okay?

54:24.294 --> 54:25.593
Why don't you just
let me talk to him?

54:25.595 --> 54:29.130
Hold on a second!
Let me talk to him for a second.

54:29.132 --> 54:30.231
Hang on.

54:30.233 --> 54:33.801
What is it that
you want from us?

54:34.069 --> 54:34.602
(CLATTERING)

54:34.604 --> 54:36.137
What was that?
KATIE: Something fell in the kitchen.

54:36.139 --> 54:39.741
JACK: Maybe he's trying
to communicate with us.

54:40.909 --> 54:43.878
LARRY: He wants us to
use the Louigi board.

54:43.880 --> 54:45.246
What's a Louigi board?

54:45.248 --> 54:46.648
Well, it's just
like the real one,

54:46.650 --> 54:49.917
but we don't have to
get clearance from Hasbro.

54:50.819 --> 54:53.755
It's working.
It's working!

54:54.890 --> 54:55.423
"I."

54:55.425 --> 54:59.060
Write this down.
Write this down. "I."

55:03.365 --> 55:05.500
Are you moving it?

55:06.635 --> 55:08.136
"A."

55:17.046 --> 55:19.447
"M."
He put an "M" in there.

55:19.449 --> 55:22.216
You know what, Larry, can we
get a crossfade on this thing?

55:22.218 --> 55:25.253
'Cause it's taking a long time.

55:30.693 --> 55:33.161
"D." Put a "D" down.

55:33.163 --> 55:35.496
What does it say?

55:36.365 --> 55:39.400
"I'm extraordinarily bored."

55:40.069 --> 55:40.468
Huh?

55:40.470 --> 55:44.038
God damn, you're black-hearted, Demon.
Come on!

55:44.040 --> 55:45.873
Quit playing games!

55:45.875 --> 55:48.343
LARRY: Well it is a game.

55:48.345 --> 55:52.347
What do you want
from Larry? What?

55:53.082 --> 55:53.715
Answer us!

55:53.717 --> 55:57.318
Put your hands on here.
Let's get this done.

56:00.122 --> 56:00.588
"Y."

56:00.590 --> 56:04.892
Hey, Larry, can we just go montage?
I'm getting kind of tired here.

56:05.327 --> 56:06.728
(LAUGHTER)

56:06.730 --> 56:10.131
Oh, no! The demon
killed Grandma!

56:10.133 --> 56:11.999
ALL: Oh!

56:12.267 --> 56:14.168
(LAUGHTER)

56:14.170 --> 56:15.803
I get to go to hell!

56:15.805 --> 56:17.638
ALL: Yay!

56:18.173 --> 56:20.141
(LAUGHTER)

56:20.509 --> 56:23.177
The demon says
I'm an alcoholic!

56:23.179 --> 56:24.512
ALL: Whoa!

56:24.514 --> 56:26.481
(LAUGHTER)

56:26.483 --> 56:30.017
The demon gave me herpes,
and I gave it to you!

56:30.019 --> 56:31.386
Herpes!

56:31.388 --> 56:33.621
(LAUGHTER)

56:33.623 --> 56:37.125
You shut your fat faces!
Why am I angry?

56:37.127 --> 56:39.093
We shouldn't be playing this.

56:39.095 --> 56:41.396
ALL: Louigi!

56:42.131 --> 56:45.700
JACK: "E." All right.
Jeez, what do we got?

56:46.702 --> 56:48.236
Looks like a poem.

56:48.238 --> 56:50.104
"Winter wind of death blows,

56:50.106 --> 56:52.874
"love smells sweet,
soon we'll be one."

56:52.876 --> 56:53.674
What does that mean?

56:53.676 --> 56:56.177
LARRY: That's not a poem.
That's a haiku.

56:56.179 --> 56:56.844
That's not a haiku.

56:56.846 --> 56:58.980
Guys, I took a class
in college, okay?

56:58.982 --> 57:02.150
For it to be a poem,
it has to rhyme.

57:02.152 --> 57:03.384
LARRY: Good point, honey.

57:03.386 --> 57:04.285
My nose is running.

57:04.287 --> 57:05.219
That's a poem.
Shut up!

57:05.221 --> 57:08.091
Okay, what this poem is
trying to tell us...

57:08.117 --> 57:09.791
Uh, haiku.
Shut up.

57:09.793 --> 57:15.563
This poem is saying there's one
thing for certain that this demon

57:15.697 --> 57:17.965
is in love with you!

57:17.967 --> 57:19.767
LARRY: Get out of here!
What are you talking about?

57:19.769 --> 57:22.804
No, it is.
It's in love with you.

57:22.806 --> 57:24.605
Read between the lines.
Look at it.

57:24.607 --> 57:29.110
It's saying it wants you and
nobody else to have you!

57:29.112 --> 57:32.113
That is why he's been
with you your whole life.

57:32.115 --> 57:34.148
That's why you killed
your stepfather!

57:34.150 --> 57:34.816
How'd you know that?

57:34.818 --> 57:36.951
I saw the first half of this movie.
Any good?

57:36.953 --> 57:39.921
Eh...
Well, what you're saying is...

57:39.923 --> 57:41.989
What I'm saying is,

57:41.991 --> 57:47.328
we've got to kill this
demon before it kills Katie.

57:48.263 --> 57:49.297
Here! Dramatic effect!

57:49.299 --> 57:51.165
Zoom in on Katie's face
for this one.

57:51.167 --> 57:56.971
We've got to kill this
demon before it kills, Katie!

57:58.340 --> 58:00.341
Okay, how do we kill it?

58:00.343 --> 58:02.844
We kill it with this.

58:05.180 --> 58:06.614
Booyah!

58:06.616 --> 58:11.152
Your demon exists in a completely
different plane of reality,

58:11.154 --> 58:13.387
but with this lens
we got right here,

58:13.389 --> 58:15.556
oh, yeah, this lens
focuses kinetic energy

58:15.558 --> 58:18.092
emitted from all kinds of
different objects in the view

58:18.094 --> 58:23.197
and then focuses this energy with a
phased array of infrared detectors,

58:23.199 --> 58:27.535
and elements, thus transmitting
the electromagnetic pulses

58:27.537 --> 58:31.906
and allowing us to view
alternate planes of reality.

58:31.908 --> 58:33.007
So that's what you got.

58:33.009 --> 58:38.246
And we'll be able to definitely
see your demon in the flesh.

58:39.047 --> 58:40.281
Flesh...

58:40.283 --> 58:41.716
That's what I got for you.

58:41.718 --> 58:43.117
I have no idea what
you just said to me,

58:43.119 --> 58:45.052
but I know you've
been drinking all day.

58:45.054 --> 58:46.454
What? Are you
a drink counter, boy?

58:46.456 --> 58:48.089
No, I'm saying
you're an alcoholic.

58:48.091 --> 58:49.924
Yeah, yeah, I already
got a mother, so shut it.

58:49.926 --> 58:52.026
LARRY: This looks
exactly the same.

58:52.028 --> 58:52.927
What are you talking about?

58:52.929 --> 58:55.997
It's all blurry right there
and the edges are blacked out.

58:55.999 --> 58:57.031
LARRY: Check upstairs.

58:57.033 --> 58:58.266
We gotta go this way then.

58:58.268 --> 58:59.600
LARRY: Okay, you see anything?
Nothing yet.

58:59.602 --> 59:02.904
LARRY: Okay, if you see something,
just give me a tap on the fanny.

59:02.906 --> 59:03.704
What? No.

59:03.706 --> 59:05.006
Oh, look out!
Look out!

59:05.008 --> 59:09.277
Leave my bitch alone,
Jack-me-off!

59:10.145 --> 59:12.046
(SCREAMING)

59:12.781 --> 59:13.447
JACK: What was that?

59:13.449 --> 59:15.516
LARRY: It's a scream light.
(SCREAMS)

59:15.518 --> 59:17.251
(SCREAMING)
It's gone. It's gone.

59:17.253 --> 59:19.387
Where the fuck is it?
Where'd it go?

59:19.389 --> 59:20.187
What was that?

59:20.189 --> 59:22.523
I don't know.
I don't...

59:22.525 --> 59:23.658
(GRUNTING)

59:23.660 --> 59:26.427
Suck the devil's dick, bitch!

59:26.429 --> 59:27.862
(CACKLING)

59:27.864 --> 59:29.397
(JACK SCREAMING)

59:29.399 --> 59:31.265
LARRY: He shivved you!

59:31.267 --> 59:33.801
The little bastard.

59:34.202 --> 59:36.037
(CACKLING)

59:41.310 --> 59:43.778
LARRY: Wow! That's...
KATIE: Larry!

59:44.079 --> 59:44.612
LARRY: Whoa.

59:44.614 --> 59:46.714
JACK: What happened?
Are you okay?

59:46.716 --> 59:48.182
Oh, my God! What?

59:48.184 --> 59:49.283
Are you okay?
You're...

59:49.285 --> 59:52.053
Are you okay?
Do I look okay?

59:52.055 --> 59:55.323
I just got shivved
by a demon up there!

59:55.325 --> 59:55.890
(MOANING)

59:55.892 --> 01:00:00.027
Okay, okay.
I got one last idea for you two.

01:00:00.029 --> 01:00:00.461
What?

01:00:00.463 --> 01:00:04.932
Run. Run.
That's what I say!

01:00:04.934 --> 01:00:06.467
I'm used to TV show blood.

01:00:06.469 --> 01:00:09.337
This is my blood.
Real blood. Ugh!

01:00:09.339 --> 01:00:13.741
Too real for me.
I'm out of here. Goodbye!

01:00:14.409 --> 01:00:16.344
Larry, I think we should
get out of here.

01:00:16.346 --> 01:00:20.848
Nah, I think we should stick
around, see what happens.

01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:22.083
Okay.

01:00:22.085 --> 01:00:24.485
Want to go to bed?
Yeah. Sure.

01:00:24.487 --> 01:00:26.621
(DEMON GROWLING)

01:00:29.424 --> 01:00:32.526
I can't sleep with
that demon growling!

01:00:32.528 --> 01:00:34.228
Neither can I.

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:36.597
How are we going
to sleep, Larry?

01:00:36.599 --> 01:00:40.234
I'm going to call
Dr. Conrad Murray.

01:00:42.838 --> 01:00:46.540
Hi, Conrad. It's me.
Yeah, we need you.

01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:54.315
Can we get some
of that Propofol...

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:57.118
Of course.
Great.

01:01:09.464 --> 01:01:10.965
Thank you.

01:01:22.244 --> 01:01:23.177
Wait!

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:28.549
I don't care what they say,
you're a good man.

01:01:54.443 --> 01:01:56.544
Time to pay the piper.

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:57.745
(SNAPS FINGERS)

01:01:57.747 --> 01:01:59.947
(CACKLES)

01:02:07.055 --> 01:02:09.323
(GURGLING)

01:02:41.890 --> 01:02:43.791
Where am I going?

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:24.458
gay.

Yeah, I'm

01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:45.746
trying to come up with something
clever to end this scene

01:04:45.748 --> 01:04:48.883
and, uh, I got nothing.

01:04:52.187 --> 01:04:55.689
Okay, let's just never
watch that again.

01:04:56.859 --> 01:04:57.992
What? What?
LARRY: Help me. Help me.

01:04:57.994 --> 01:05:00.160
What? What's wrong?
LARRY: Something happened last night.

01:05:00.162 --> 01:05:00.861
What happened?

01:05:00.863 --> 01:05:02.830
LARRY: Something happened.
KATIE: Come here.

01:05:02.832 --> 01:05:04.031
I got branded.
KATIE: Oh, my God!

01:05:04.033 --> 01:05:06.166
The demon branded me
with a gun!

01:05:06.168 --> 01:05:07.101
Oh, my God, Larry.

01:05:07.103 --> 01:05:08.535
It's a gun!
It's not a gun.

01:05:08.537 --> 01:05:10.437
Larry, that's a...
That's a penis.

01:05:10.439 --> 01:05:13.274
What are you talking about?
He branded me with a gun!

01:05:13.276 --> 01:05:14.708
It hurts, Katie! Look at it!

01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:17.344
I'm looking. Babe,
that's definitely a penis.

01:05:17.346 --> 01:05:18.979
Look at it.
Now stop it!

01:05:18.981 --> 01:05:20.714
I'm looking.
Stop it!

01:05:20.716 --> 01:05:22.082
It's a handle and a muzzle.

01:05:22.084 --> 01:05:24.618
It's balls and a shaft.
Stop it!

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:29.490
Stop it now! It's a handle
of a gun and a muzzle.

01:05:29.492 --> 01:05:31.425
Stop it. It hurts.
Balls and a penis

01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:34.161
and the shaft with
a mushroom head.

01:05:34.163 --> 01:05:35.629
Katie, that's a silencer!

01:05:35.631 --> 01:05:37.965
Get out of here!
God almighty!

01:05:37.967 --> 01:05:40.301
You don't even know.
Larry, I'm calling a priest.

01:05:40.303 --> 01:05:42.536
Why would a demon
brand a penis on you?

01:05:42.538 --> 01:05:44.371
Call a priest, but
tell him it's a gun.

01:05:44.373 --> 01:05:47.574
It's definitely a penis.
I've seen a million of them.

01:05:47.576 --> 01:05:48.342
Larry, it has pubic hair.

01:05:48.344 --> 01:05:51.745
You don't know what a gun is?
It's a gun, it's a gun like this.

01:05:51.747 --> 01:05:56.350
I've seen a gun, and I've seen a
penis and that is a penis, Larry.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

01:05:58.721 --> 01:06:00.654
I wonder who this could be.

01:06:00.656 --> 01:06:03.624
Oh, no, no, no. We already
said we don't want any.

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:07.928
Oh, wait! Do you people do exorcisms?
We need a priest.

01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:09.763
No, I'm sorry, you need
the Catholics for that.

01:06:09.765 --> 01:06:14.068
We could use your help, though.
We're missing some of our flock.

01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:14.668
LARRY: Chickens?

01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:18.172
Mormons. Surely,
you've seen them.

01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:22.476
They were last seen
entering your home.

01:06:22.478 --> 01:06:24.645
Uh, no, it doesn't ring a bell.

01:06:24.647 --> 01:06:27.881
Here, have a look.
It's in the script. Page 35.

01:06:27.883 --> 01:06:30.084
Oh, yes!
Now I see. Yeah.

01:06:30.086 --> 01:06:33.754
They were downstairs talking
to our squatter, Bill.

01:06:33.756 --> 01:06:35.689
Actually, I prefer house guest.

01:06:35.691 --> 01:06:40.361
I have a question. Let me
ask you all something.

01:06:42.664 --> 01:06:46.300
If you were stranded on
the ocean, dying of thirst,

01:06:46.302 --> 01:06:50.537
would it be better to drink
sea water or your own urine?

01:06:50.539 --> 01:06:53.907
Now, think about it,
think about it.

01:06:53.909 --> 01:06:57.444
Let's go down into the
basement and we'll discuss it.

01:06:57.446 --> 01:06:58.612
Okay? Come on.

01:06:58.614 --> 01:07:00.814
Thank you.
Okay.

01:07:02.917 --> 01:07:04.952
It would be urine, right?

Disappointed!

01:16:20.041 --> 01:16:24.878
Hi, girl, hi! We've come back
for another party, y'all.

01:16:25.079 --> 01:16:26.546
(SCREAMING)

01:16:30.785 --> 01:16:32.619
I think that guy
just stabbed me!

01:16:32.621 --> 01:16:36.289
He just stabbed you?
He totally just stabbed me!

01:16:36.291 --> 01:16:37.824

01:16:40.895 --> 01:16:43.096
Jesus Christ!
Now he stabbed me!

01:16:43.098 --> 01:16:44.531
He just stabbed you, too!

01:16:44.533 --> 01:16:45.398
Yeah, he stabbed me, too.

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:46.466
Oh, my God. He just
stabbed us both!

01:16:46.468 --> 01:16:50.103
That is not cool, Shakira.
Totally not cool.

01:16:50.105 --> 01:16:51.171
Seriously.

01:16:51.173 --> 01:16:53.139
I think there's a dead guy
on the floor right there.

01:16:53.141 --> 01:16:55.141
Oh, he's deader
than this party.

01:16:55.143 --> 01:16:57.344
Ew! Let's just leave
this whole scene.

01:16:57.346 --> 01:16:58.612
Yeah. We're out of Audi.

01:16:58.614 --> 01:17:00.680
See ya, wouldn't want to be ya.

01:17:00.682 --> 01:17:05.285
Ow. It hurts getting stabbed.
It totally hurts, right?

01:17:14.962 --> 01:17:19.199
Guys, I'm here for
the threesome.

01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:20.967
No?

01:17:21.369 --> 01:17:22.902

01:17:29.711 --> 01:17:31.211
(LAUGHING)

01:17:32.446 --> 01:17:35.615
Guys, I just need
one more shot.

01:17:35.617 --> 01:17:37.450
KATIE: Is that Ted Striker?

01:17:39.453 --> 01:17:41.287

01:17:49.130 --> 01:17:51.297
He shivved me!

01:17:51.299 --> 01:17:53.233
He shivved me!

01:17:53.868 --> 01:17:56.503
Surely you can't be serious.

01:18:06.047 --> 01:18:08.248
KATIE: Who's that?

01:18:10.918 --> 01:18:12.886

01:18:34.041 --> 01:18:36.876
KATIE: Oh, my God.
Hello?

01:18:36.878 --> 01:18:39.112
It's Quinton
from <i>The Blind Side.</i>

01:18:39.114 --> 01:18:41.181
I played Big Mike.
KATIE: I love that movie.

01:18:41.183 --> 01:18:45.418
I heard some commotion.
Just, I got your back.

01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:47.287
(SCREAMING)

01:18:49.757 --> 01:18:52.325

(DISTORTED HUMMING)

01:20:59.653 --> 01:21:00.119
Hey!

01:21:00.121 --> 01:21:05.058
Why don't you pick on someone
in your own universe, Demon?

01:21:05.125 --> 01:21:07.093
Yeah. I tell you what.

01:21:07.095 --> 01:21:11.097
Why don't you and I
discuss this over a brewski?

01:21:11.099 --> 01:21:13.900
Come on, sit over here with me.

01:21:16.270 --> 01:21:18.071
You like beer, don't you?

01:21:18.073 --> 01:21:19.606
Uh-huh.

01:21:22.376 --> 01:21:27.547
So tell me, why do you
want this guy so bad?

01:21:28.249 --> 01:21:29.115
(DISTORTED)
Well, I don't know.

01:21:29.117 --> 01:21:33.820
I mean, really. I've taken shits
that are more interesting than him.

01:21:33.822 --> 01:21:34.654
(DISTORTED) I don't know.

01:21:34.656 --> 01:21:37.724
Wouldn't you want someone
with a little more flavor?

01:21:37.726 --> 01:21:42.095
Someone with
a little more pizzazz?

01:21:43.130 --> 01:21:47.367
Someone in the top thousand
of IMDb's STARmeter.

01:21:47.501 --> 01:21:50.003
(DISTORTED) Oh.
Mmm-hmm.

01:21:50.005 --> 01:21:53.373
I tell you what.
I know you're bored.

01:21:57.745 --> 01:22:01.080
Why don't you and
I get a little weird?

01:22:01.082 --> 01:22:01.915
Just you and me together.

01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:03.665
That's right. Look over here.

01:22:03.691 --> 01:22:06.644
Right here. Now open your
mouth nice and wide.

01:22:14.561 --> 01:22:16.029
Whoa! What happened?

01:22:16.031 --> 01:22:18.531
Larry, you're back.
Oh, Katie!

01:22:18.533 --> 01:22:21.367
His plan worked.
Bill saved you.

01:22:21.369 --> 01:22:24.938
He's the best squatter
a guy could ever have.

01:22:25.572 --> 01:22:27.440
(SCREAMING)
KATE: Bill?

01:22:27.442 --> 01:22:30.410

Bye, Bill.
Bye, Bill.

01:23:49.523 --> 01:23:54.260
This movie is gonna go
straight on the fucking DVD.

(CREW LAUGHING)

01:23:54.796 --> 01:23:59.332
This fucking sucks!
You're looking for a theater release?

01:23:59.334 --> 01:24:00.733
No way!

01:24:03.737 --> 01:24:08.174
I fucked your tusk and
you didn't even know it.

01:24:27.561 --> 01:24:30.363
Bunch of fucking losers!
