[boy] I don't wanna get all up--

15:37.971 --> 15:39.270
[woman] God damn it, Kenny!

15:39.272 --> 15:40.705
It's your job!

15:42.142 --> 15:44.475
[narrator]
<i> And he was a great threat</i>

15:44.477 --> 15:47.578
<i> to the monsters</i>
<i> lurking among them.</i>

15:48.348 --> 15:50.315
I thank thee, oh Lord,

15:50.317 --> 15:52.717
for this glorious opportunity

15:52.719 --> 15:54.719
to embrace danger

15:54.721 --> 15:56.554
and court death.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.223
Fly, Rosacea!

15:59.225 --> 16:01.526
[horn blaring]

16:03.363 --> 16:05.430

[engine sputtering]

16:30.123 --> 16:31.222
[sword rasps]

16:34.260 --> 16:37.028
To your knees, vile creature!

16:37.030 --> 16:39.263
[grumbling]

16:39.265 --> 16:41.332
[suspenseful music]

16:41.334 --> 16:45.370
What? Are you as deaf
as you are hideous?

16:45.372 --> 16:47.338
Answer my challenge,

16:47.340 --> 16:50.274
lest my glory be written
in your blood.

16:52.579 --> 16:54.545
[screaming]

16:54.547 --> 16:57.248
[Don Quixote groans]
Die, foul beast!

16:57.250 --> 16:58.783
Your wicked reign

16:58.785 --> 17:00.685
over these lands

17:00.687 --> 17:03.521
shall end at the end of this,

17:03.523 --> 17:05.056

[metal clanging]

17:07.327 --> 17:09.277

17:09.278 --> 17:11.228
[Don Quixote]
Yes! Recoil your hideous head.

17:12.599 --> 17:15.233
I commend my body and soul

17:15.235 --> 17:17.802
in these
highly dangerous efforts

17:17.804 --> 17:21.205
to my one true love
and captor of my heart,

17:21.207 --> 17:23.641
that peerless
and noble beauty...

17:23.643 --> 17:25.743
[heavy breathing]

17:27.547 --> 17:30.181
That peerless
and noble beauty...

17:32.285 --> 17:34.352
[light music]

17:38.058 --> 17:40.825
The Lady Dulce

17:40.827 --> 17:45.663

Aah!

17:50.070 --> 17:51.436
[grunting]

17:51.438 --> 17:53.204
You're gonna break!

17:55.542 --> 17:58.076
[screaming]

18:01.781 --> 18:04.816
[Don Quixote] I've pierced

[panting]

18:33.580 --> 18:35.646
[tranquil music]

18:36.416 --> 18:37.882
Of course.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.717
Of course. My squire.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.219
[Don Quixote]
Where have you been?

18:41.221 --> 18:43.187
I cannot
successfully conduct adventures

18:43.189 --> 18:44.255
without a squire.

18:44.257 --> 18:45.323
It is not done.

18:45.325 --> 18:46.557
-Ow.
-[Don Quixote] Did you see it?

18:46.559 --> 18:48.059
See... See what?

18:48.060 --> 18:49.560
Quit your babbling
and answer my question.

18:49.562 --> 18:52.697
Did you or did you not see here
a hideous beast?

18:52.699 --> 18:54.866
With a moist and bilious eye?

18:54.868 --> 18:57.435
Did you not smell
the creature's putrid breath?

18:57.437 --> 18:59.537
I... I just saw the oil machine.
I didn't--

18:59.539 --> 19:00.905
It cannot be.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.840
Only a fool
would attack a machine.

19:02.842 --> 19:04.442
And I, as you well know,

19:04.444 --> 19:06.711
am less a fool
than any man alive.

19:06.713 --> 19:08.146
[machine creaking]

19:08.148 --> 19:09.313
Unless...

19:10.183 --> 19:11.616
Of course.

19:11.618 --> 19:16.187
Of course. Freston.
Oh, you wretched cur.

19:16.189 --> 19:17.788
[Don Quixote] Clearly,
that wizard metamorphosed

19:17.790 --> 19:19.290
the giant, at the last second,

19:19.292 --> 19:20.691
into this iron contraption

19:20.693 --> 19:22.693
to deprive me of my glory.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.829
And you, you're the proof.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.331
Obviously, such spells only work

19:27.333 --> 19:29.400
on the acute senses
of knights-errant.

19:29.402 --> 19:32.170
So the fact that it was all
invisible to your simple mind,

19:32.172 --> 19:33.404
proves that it is so.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.206
Come along, Sancho.

19:35.208 --> 19:37.275
[armor clinking]

19:39.612 --> 19:41.812
When a knight-errant
strides forth,

19:41.814 --> 19:43.347
his squire follows.

19:43.349 --> 19:44.415
Come along.

19:46.352 --> 19:48.286
My, my name is Kevin.

19:48.288 --> 19:50.421
Nonsense.
That's no name for a squire.

19:50.423 --> 19:53.291
Only you, Sancho,
would have your senses scrambled

19:53.293 --> 19:54.559
by a blow to another man's head.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.711
Ow!

19:56.712 --> 19:58.862
[Don Quixote]
You are Sancho, my squire.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.598
Do I get paid for squiring?

20:00.600 --> 20:02.951
Paid?

20:02.952 --> 20:05.303
Isn't it enough to feel
the frisson of adventure?

20:05.305 --> 20:07.371
To know that you are loved
and admired

20:07.373 --> 20:08.906
for your deeds alone?

20:08.908 --> 20:10.508
Isn't that the greatest reward

20:10.510 --> 20:11.976
that a man could ever receive?

20:11.978 --> 20:14.312
For some people maybe,

20:14.314 --> 20:17.515
but I need 155 dollars
because they shut my phone off.

20:17.517 --> 20:18.616
And my stepdad's
a piece of shit, so...

20:18.618 --> 20:20.418
Fine. Fine.

20:20.420 --> 20:23.754
You shall have
all that you require and more.

20:24.591 --> 20:25.823
I give you my word.

puts his own desires

above his communities.

21:51.577 --> 21:54.412
It threatens their comfort
and safety.

21:56.449 --> 22:01.085
It only takes the smallest tug
on the thinnest thread

22:01.087 --> 22:02.953
to unravel the fabric.

Sancho! Make sure that Rosacea
is groomed and fed.

22:31.751 --> 22:33.117
I think
I'm gonna call you Dapple.

22:34.454 --> 22:35.553
Yeah.

22:39.726 --> 22:41.992
Glory is mine.

22:50.603 --> 22:53.003
[Don Quixote] ...witness
the very method of trickery used

22:53.005 --> 22:55.106
by the great Renaldo De Morello

22:55.108 --> 22:57.508
to defeat
the Thousand Bulgarians

22:57.510 --> 22:59.577
and their Tiger Army.

22:59.579 --> 23:02.146
Wow!
A thousand Bulgarian tigers?

23:02.148 --> 23:03.914
-[thuds]
-What?

23:03.916 --> 23:05.883
There are no tigers in Bulgaria.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.451
You just said--

23:07.453 --> 23:10.554
Obviously, they were brought in
from India or China

23:10.556 --> 23:12.757
or some other
tiger-infested realm,

23:12.759 --> 23:15.726
and merely deployed
by the Bulgarians.

23:15.728 --> 23:18.796
Oh, okay. Okay.

23:18.798 --> 23:20.898
But I still don't get
how we're gonna get

23:20.900 --> 23:22.833
a thousand tigers though.

23:22.835 --> 23:23.968
-[thumps]
-Ow! hey!

23:23.970 --> 23:26.804
You must pay better attention,
Sancho.

23:26.806 --> 23:29.440
The Bulgarians had the tigers.

23:29.442 --> 23:32.009
It is Morello's tactic
to defeat them

23:32.011 --> 23:33.811
that we shall deploy.

23:33.813 --> 23:35.780
It is a thing of great cunning.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.616
Oh. Wonderful.

Let that foul wizard Freston

23:56.602 --> 23:58.769
try and work his magic
on me now.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.971
I shall be as invisible as he.

24:00.973 --> 24:03.073
Uh, shouldn't I have
some mud on me to or--

24:03.075 --> 24:04.809
You are but a squire.
It's unnecessary.

24:04.811 --> 24:06.477
But anybody who sees me
is gonna see you--

24:06.479 --> 24:08.946
Shush! Now, remember, Sancho.

24:08.948 --> 24:12.082
You may only assist me
if I drop my sword,

24:12.084 --> 24:15.186
or if I need
to be administered a poultice

24:15.188 --> 24:17.588
due to some grave
and bloody wound.

24:20.159 --> 24:22.693
Whoa. What, what, what.

24:23.162 --> 24:25.095
Oh.

24:25.097 --> 24:27.565
Oh, oh. Oh, okay.

24:27.567 --> 24:28.999
Oh, oh, okay.

24:30.169 --> 24:32.536
In the pursuit of arms, Sancho,

24:32.538 --> 24:34.805
death
is your constant companion.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.607
It is likely that,

24:36.609 --> 24:40.711
I shall be disemboweled
or receive a deep gash

24:40.713 --> 24:43.147
to the head in a battle
with a hundred of my enemies.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.150
And as I lay upon the ground,

24:46.152 --> 24:49.019
taking my final sweet breaths,

24:49.021 --> 24:52.857
it will be you, my squire,
who will weep for me.

24:52.859 --> 24:56.494
Your tears falling down
upon me like rain

24:56.496 --> 24:58.662
on a parched earth.

24:58.664 --> 25:01.999
Heartbroken,
you will hear my final words,

25:02.001 --> 25:04.568
in which I pledge my love
to my lady.

25:06.005 --> 25:10.541
Then you will, no doubt,
remove my helmet,

25:10.543 --> 25:11.976
better to hear my devotions.

25:13.846 --> 25:17.648
You will take that helmet
to the Lady Dulce de Leche,

25:18.551 --> 25:19.917
and lay it at her feet.

25:21.521 --> 25:22.953
She will see the marks upon it,

25:23.856 --> 25:26.123
where I took my final blows.

25:26.125 --> 25:30.594
Fearless and unwavering
in my bravery and my devotion.

25:30.596 --> 25:33.030
[whimpering]

25:33.032 --> 25:35.966
And at last, I will be worthy

25:37.303 --> 25:39.136
of her perfect love.

25:41.007 --> 25:42.306
What's a poultice?

25:43.676 --> 25:44.808
-[thwacks]
-Ow!

25:47.013 --> 25:49.213
-[Sancho] Where, where are you--
-[Don Quixote screams]

-Ooh!

26:14.640 --> 26:16.040
Repent, slaver!

26:16.042 --> 26:19.209
A knight-errant
cannot abide servitude.

26:19.211 --> 26:20.844
-[man 4] Hold up.
-Collect their weapons.

26:20.846 --> 26:23.047
What? You said not to,
to help you with the--

26:23.049 --> 26:24.348
I'm making an exception.

26:24.350 --> 26:25.883
Oh, my gosh.
This is happening so--

26:25.885 --> 26:27.284
I should remove your head,

26:27.286 --> 26:29.286
but instead,
I shall confound it.

26:29.288 --> 26:30.754
-[Don Quixote] Answer me this,
-[Sancho] I'm so sorry...

26:30.756 --> 26:32.356
who is the greater fool,

26:32.357 --> 26:33.957
the man who accepts his fate
or the man who creates it?

26:33.960 --> 26:36.627
Whichever one is you,
that's the fool.

26:36.629 --> 26:38.245
Incorrect!

26:38.246 --> 26:39.862
[Don Quixote]
I am the master of my fate.

26:39.865 --> 26:41.999
You, mademoiselle, are a vassal.

26:42.001 --> 26:45.636
A vassal does what she is told
without regard to justice.

26:45.638 --> 26:47.204
A free man does what is just

26:47.206 --> 26:49.073

to what he is told.

26:49.675 --> 26:51.258
Bind her hands.

26:51.259 --> 26:52.842
Are you sure?
We just took her gun.

26:52.845 --> 26:54.678
[Don Quixote]
Bind them, noble squire.

26:54.680 --> 26:56.113
[sighs]

26:56.115 --> 26:57.615
[Sancho exhales deeply]

26:57.617 --> 26:59.383
I knew I should have
put mud on me.

26:59.385 --> 27:01.085
[Sancho] I'm so sorry.

27:01.087 --> 27:02.853

27:02.855 --> 27:04.989
[Don Quixote grunting]

27:06.759 --> 27:09.159
Greetings, slaves!

27:09.161 --> 27:10.227
-[Don Quixote] I,
-[prisoner] Slaves?

27:10.229 --> 27:12.296
Don Quixote of La Mancha,

27:12.298 --> 27:14.698
hereby liberate you.

27:14.700 --> 27:17.067
Go, wretched servants,

27:17.069 --> 27:20.204
to the Lady Dulce de Leche
of Tabasco,

27:20.206 --> 27:23.674
and say that,
I, Don Quixote of La Mancha

27:23.676 --> 27:28.078
dedicate this great victory
to you, peerless lady

27:28.080 --> 27:30.247
and captor of his heart.

27:30.249 --> 27:31.348
[Sancho whimpers]

27:31.350 --> 27:34.151
Yes. Yes.

27:34.153 --> 27:37.421
Go! Taste your sweet,
sweet freedom.

27:37.423 --> 27:41.291
Embrace the horizon
and find your true calling.

27:41.293 --> 27:42.893
Go with God.

27:42.895 --> 27:44.895
What the hell is wrong with you?

27:44.897 --> 27:46.897
[man 4] Man, I'm in for a D.U.I.

27:46.899 --> 27:48.432
I got one week left.

27:48.434 --> 27:50.768
Now, who you think's gonna
go down for this?

27:50.770 --> 27:51.869
Huh?

27:53.939 --> 27:55.939
[grunting]

27:57.076 --> 27:59.810
Avast.

27:59.812 --> 28:02.012
-[Don Quixote] Flee, Sancho!
-[Sancho] What, what?

28:02.014 --> 28:04.081
-Ingrates!
-Oh, my god!

28:04.750 --> 28:06.850
[grunting]

28:06.852 --> 28:09.353
[Sancho] Oh, my god! Aah!

28:32.845 --> 28:35.079
<i> Still, it was</i>
<i> a glorious victory.</i>

28:35.715 --> 28:37.114
You know Sancho,

28:37.116 --> 28:40.217
I believe that one
of those slaves was a criminal.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.786
One of them?
They were all criminals.

28:42.788 --> 28:43.921
Impossible.

28:43.923 --> 28:46.423
Only a fool
would liberate a criminal.

28:46.425 --> 28:48.158
And as I am certainly no fool,

28:48.160 --> 28:49.493
they cannot,
therefore, be criminals.

28:49.495 --> 28:51.762
No. No. No. No, no, no.

28:51.764 --> 28:53.163
The only two
that weren't criminals,

28:53.165 --> 28:54.798
were the ones that were cops.

28:56.802 --> 28:57.935
Yeah.

29:04.210 --> 29:06.310
[upbeat music]

29:07.780 --> 29:10.114
[narrator]
<i> And Don Quixote's fame</i>

29:16.122 --> 29:18.188
[laughs]
<i> Heh he was playing possum.</i>

29:18.190 --> 29:19.923
Disdain for authority

29:19.925 --> 29:22.793
always presents
an imminent threat.

29:22.795 --> 29:25.028
We should be prepared to use
lethal force.

29:25.030 --> 29:27.064
I'm gonna work over
this neighborhood.

29:27.066 --> 29:28.932
Put another patrolman over here.

29:30.069 --> 29:32.136
He'll be out
in public somewhere.

29:33.072 --> 29:34.838
Preening,

29:34.840 --> 29:37.541
looking to be admired,
respected.

29:37.543 --> 29:38.942
That will not happen.

29:41.080 --> 29:44.148
[Sancho] Um, what are you doing?

29:44.150 --> 29:45.482
I am in repose.

29:46.218 --> 29:48.085
What's repose?

29:48.087 --> 29:51.889
Obviously,
it is when you pose again.

29:51.891 --> 29:54.992
All knights-errant
spend their nights in repose,

29:54.994 --> 29:57.461
standing in some glade,
contemplating and fasting.

29:57.463 --> 29:59.096
-What?
-You must acquaint yourself

29:59.098 --> 30:00.831
with the history, Sancho.

30:00.833 --> 30:04.101
Knights-errant only eat
at sumptuous feasts

30:04.103 --> 30:05.836
and they never sleep at all.

30:05.838 --> 30:08.005
They live on
the meat of their desires,

30:08.007 --> 30:09.940
and the sweetness of their love.

30:14.847 --> 30:16.197
What do squires do?

30:16.198 --> 30:17.548
The habits of squires
are of such little importance,

30:17.550 --> 30:20.050
that they are not mentioned
in the chronicles.

30:21.587 --> 30:23.037
[scoffs]

30:23.038 --> 30:24.488
Okay, well,
I think squires go inside.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.740
-What?
-I'm a squire, right?

30:26.741 --> 30:28.991
I'm your squire, so I would know
the most about being a squire.

30:28.994 --> 30:32.095
I think that squires
probably go inside.

30:32.097 --> 30:35.165
And I think, since
you keep saying I'm simple,

30:35.167 --> 30:38.602
I probably do simple things
like, eat dinner.

30:38.604 --> 30:42.439
[Sancho] And sleep on a bed
with clean sheets, and a fan

30:42.441 --> 30:43.507
that makes a nice humming noise.

30:43.509 --> 30:44.908
All right. All right. All right.

30:44.910 --> 30:47.044
Sancho, as you well know,

30:47.046 --> 30:49.146
I can easily withstand

30:49.148 --> 30:51.615
the nightly
knightly deprivations at hand.

30:51.617 --> 30:53.834
However,

30:53.835 --> 30:56.052
it may be unreasonable of me
to expect a squire

30:56.055 --> 30:57.554
to endure such rigors.

30:57.556 --> 31:00.123
Perhaps, just this once,

31:00.125 --> 31:02.159
we can suffer,

31:02.161 --> 31:04.261
-such vulgar comforts.
-That's all I could ask for.

31:04.263 --> 31:06.363
-Just this once!
-[Sancho] Okay. Yeah.

31:07.933 --> 31:10.300
[water sloshing]

31:17.343 --> 31:20.143
[Sancho] Yo. I'm guessing
you got a nice house, right?

[narrator]<i> The niece</i>

31:26.652 --> 31:28.952

31:28.954 --> 31:31.021
<i>that a true knight could rest...</i>

31:32.191 --> 31:34.291

31:43.002 --> 31:44.501
-[crashes]
-a grateful world provides

31:44.503 --> 31:46.303

31:52.578 --> 31:55.279
I, Don Quixote of La Mancha,

your wretched and empty lives.

32:00.085 --> 32:01.151

32:01.153 --> 32:03.287
bring some oats for my mount.

32:03.289 --> 32:04.688
Out by the portcullis.

32:04.690 --> 32:07.157
And fetch the master
of this castle.

32:07.159 --> 32:09.126
I'm the owner of this place.

32:09.128 --> 32:12.562
Oh. My deepest apologies.

32:12.564 --> 32:14.231
Your Moorish countenance

32:14.233 --> 32:16.700
was obviously the cause
of this misunderstanding.

32:16.702 --> 32:20.137
We require a feast
and succor for my squire.

32:22.508 --> 32:23.640
[man laughs]

32:25.010 --> 32:27.177

-[chuckles]

32:27.179 --> 32:29.079
Many thanks, wench.

32:29.081 --> 32:31.248
Typically,
in such a fine castle,

32:31.250 --> 32:33.483
this would be mutton or pheasant

32:33.485 --> 32:35.585
or some other such rare game.

32:38.090 --> 32:40.023
Your Arab,

32:40.025 --> 32:41.992
is a different breed of man,

32:41.994 --> 32:45.228

and marvelous cuisine.

32:45.631 --> 32:47.030
Mm-hm. Yeah.

32:47.032 --> 32:48.165
-We talked about...
-Ow!

to shut up.

What are you doing?

33:08.020 --> 33:10.420

33:10.422 --> 33:12.689
Rest assured that
in my presence,

33:12.691 --> 33:14.725
you and your modesty are as safe

33:14.727 --> 33:16.526

brah!

I assure you, sir,

33:22.568 --> 33:24.101
my intentions are chaste.

33:24.103 --> 33:25.669
You're about to get your ass
chased right outta here

33:25.671 --> 33:27.871
if you don't listen to me
when I talk.

33:27.872 --> 33:30.072
Hey, hey, man. Just cut him
some slack, all right?

33:30.075 --> 33:31.141
[whispering]
He's a little crazy.

33:31.143 --> 33:32.476
Imma cut him more than that

33:32.478 --> 33:34.378
if he don't start
paying attention.

33:34.380 --> 33:36.747
I must warn you, sir,
I am a knight.

Boss, um, this is not the time.

33:42.755 --> 33:45.522
[Trout laughs]

33:45.524 --> 33:47.591
You need to put that sword away
before you get yourself killed.

33:47.593 --> 33:50.660
Huh? All right?

33:52.464 --> 33:54.064
You got the costume,

33:54.066 --> 33:56.400

all old-timey,

33:56.402 --> 33:57.667

34:03.442 --> 34:05.609
-You...

[armor clattering]

34:21.627 --> 34:22.692
Yeah, didn't think so.

34:26.632 --> 34:28.198
I told you he wasn't a knight.

34:28.200 --> 34:29.666
[Sancho]
What, what's wrong boss?

34:29.668 --> 34:31.201
Boss? What's wrong?
What's wrong?

34:32.271 --> 34:36.106
It's true. I am not a knight.

34:36.108 --> 34:38.809
I, I didn't wanna say anything.
I mean, I thought you knew.

34:38.811 --> 34:41.078
All the histories
that I've read,

34:41.080 --> 34:43.747
there's always some ritual.

34:43.749 --> 34:45.749
Some manner of declaration.

34:45.751 --> 34:49.419
An official bestowing of
the title of Knight-errant.

34:49.421 --> 34:50.720
I have had no such ceremony.

34:52.157 --> 34:53.824
I, I must find a,

You may commence.

35:16.248 --> 35:18.315
[somber music]

35:20.319 --> 35:23.320
All that's required
is that you list my virtues.

35:23.322 --> 35:25.155
[stutters]
And use as many long

35:25.157 --> 35:26.790
and meaningful-sounding words
as possible.

of too much tenderness.

your own understanding of love

35:52.518 --> 35:54.751
and to bleed willingly
and joyfully.

35:56.288 --> 35:57.921
To wake at dawn
with a winged heart,

35:57.923 --> 36:00.724
and give thanks
for another day of loving.

36:00.726 --> 36:03.460
To rest at noon hour,
and meditate love's ecstasy.

36:03.462 --> 36:05.495
To return home at eventide

36:05.497 --> 36:07.664
with gratitude,
and then to sleep

36:07.666 --> 36:10.800
with a prayer for
the beloved in your heart

36:10.802 --> 36:13.370
and a song of praise
on your lips."

I can already feel my love
and my righteous rage

36:46.638 --> 36:48.471
becoming unbearable.

36:50.275 --> 36:52.409
Prepare a room for my squire.

36:52.411 --> 36:58.215
I must go and contemplate
my disappointment and my pain.

36:58.217 --> 37:00.884
Suffering is essential
to my success.

38:24.336 --> 38:26.303
[Nikki shushes]
Don't wake him up.

38:26.305 --> 38:27.804
Ah. Oh, shit!

38:27.806 --> 38:30.573
[Lexi] Stop it.
What are you doing?

38:30.575 --> 38:32.042
-[snoring]
-[Nikki] Go check his pockets.

38:33.545 --> 38:35.045
[Lexi] Okay, try his pants.

38:35.047 --> 38:36.880
[Nikki] Okay,
this guy has nothing.

38:38.917 --> 38:40.784
-[Sancho coughs]
-[Lexi] Oh, damn it.

38:40.786 --> 38:42.385
Hey, baby.

38:42.387 --> 38:43.787
I just thought
you might need some company.

38:43.789 --> 38:45.422
-[thwacks]
-[screaming]

38:45.424 --> 38:46.856
[Sancho groans]

38:46.858 --> 38:48.792
[all screaming]

38:48.794 --> 38:50.360
He punched me in the head!

38:50.362 --> 38:51.928
-[Trout] Punched my girlfriend?
-[Sancho] No!

38:51.929 --> 38:53.495
-[Lexi] He did!
-[Trout] You punched my girl?

38:53.498 --> 38:55.065
-No. No. No.
-Did you punch my girl, bro?

38:55.067 --> 38:56.433
-[Lexi] Kill him!
-[Sancho] No. No. No.

38:56.435 --> 38:58.501
[Big Mike] Trout!

38:58.503 --> 39:00.337
Might wanna think about
the other legal issues

39:00.339 --> 39:01.971
that come into play here.

39:01.973 --> 39:03.340
We gotta do something, though?

39:03.342 --> 39:04.574
[Big Mike] He's just a dumb kid.

39:04.576 --> 39:05.675
No, please.

39:05.676 --> 39:06.775
[Big Mike]
I say we treat him like one.

39:08.714 --> 39:11.514
-[all laugh]
-[Sancho] I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

39:12.451 --> 39:14.517
[upbeat music]

39:14.519 --> 39:15.819
[indistinct chatter]

39:15.821 --> 39:17.420
Oh, what's the matter?
You scared?

39:17.422 --> 39:18.855
[Sancho] Don Quixote!

39:18.857 --> 39:20.023
[Sancho whimpers]

39:20.759 --> 39:22.058
Please!

39:22.060 --> 39:24.828
-Please!
-[groans]

39:24.830 --> 39:26.129
[Sancho] I quit doing it too!

39:26.131 --> 39:27.430
Oh, no!

39:27.432 --> 39:28.732
[all laugh]

39:28.734 --> 39:30.100
[growling]

39:31.370 --> 39:34.137

[squelches]

39:44.649 --> 39:46.516
[indistinct chatter]

39:46.518 --> 39:48.118
[Don Quixote] Behold!

39:48.120 --> 39:49.452
-[thuds]
-[grunts]

39:51.123 --> 39:54.491
How fortunate you are
to bear witness to my success.

39:55.861 --> 39:57.727
Though obviously too small

39:57.729 --> 39:59.763
to be the Giant of Andecoria,

39:59.765 --> 40:01.798
the creature towered over me

40:01.800 --> 40:03.566
until I relieved him
of his head,

40:03.568 --> 40:05.168
whereupon his body vanished.

40:05.170 --> 40:07.003
No doubt,
from some ancient spell.

40:07.005 --> 40:08.471
[Kamil]
What is going on out here?

40:08.473 --> 40:10.774
My Lord, take this tribute

40:10.776 --> 40:13.610
to the Lady Dulce De Leche
of Tabasco.

40:14.913 --> 40:18.148
And say that,
"I, Don Quixote of La Mancha,

40:18.150 --> 40:20.483
dedicate this tribute to you,

40:20.485 --> 40:23.453
peerless lady
and captor of his heart."

40:24.623 --> 40:25.722
[grunts]

40:32.130 --> 40:34.197
[fanfare]

40:37.903 --> 40:41.538
[all laughing]

40:42.507 --> 40:45.108
[engine clicking]

40:45.110 --> 40:47.610
-[Sancho] Whoa!
-[Don Quixote] Merci, Sancho.

40:47.612 --> 40:48.978
Wait, wait, wait!

40:48.980 --> 40:51.214
Wait, wait, wait! I can't--

40:53.018 --> 40:55.084
[light music]

40:59.724 --> 41:03.526
[narrator]<i> The great knight</i>
<i>could sense that the excitement</i>

41:03.528 --> 41:06.162
<i> had taken a toll</i>
<i> on his poor squire.</i>

41:07.499 --> 41:10.533
<i> Luckily, he knew a remedy.</i>

41:10.535 --> 41:12.569
[Don Quixote]
<i> It's your own fault, Sancho.</i>

41:12.571 --> 41:14.737
Your selfishness
brought you this pain.

41:14.739 --> 41:17.173
I should never
have acceded to your demands

41:17.175 --> 41:18.608
for safety and comfort.

41:18.610 --> 41:20.009
Those things, Sancho,

41:20.011 --> 41:23.680
are as dangerous
as a thousand monsters.

41:23.682 --> 41:26.883
We could instead
have spent our time here

41:26.885 --> 41:30.787
where all good things happen
and all sweetness is made.

41:32.023 --> 41:33.790
In nature!

41:33.792 --> 41:36.993
Nature provides us
with all we need.

41:37.863 --> 41:39.696
There's a balm, Sancho,

41:39.698 --> 41:42.565
that only a knights-errant
may employ.

41:42.567 --> 41:45.502
Luckily, I have
the sacred formula

41:45.504 --> 41:47.270
hidden away in my mind.

41:49.674 --> 41:50.740
[Sancho groans]

41:51.610 --> 41:53.543
[panting]

41:54.646 --> 41:56.145
Behold!

41:56.147 --> 41:59.215
The Balsam of Fierbras.

41:59.217 --> 42:02.719
It cures any ailment
and heals any wound.

42:09.694 --> 42:10.760
[exhales deeply]

42:14.833 --> 42:17.734
[stomach rumbling]

42:18.837 --> 42:20.737

42:20.739 --> 42:22.839
[stomach rumbling]

42:24.876 --> 42:26.175
-[Don Quixote chuckles]
-[grunts]

42:27.846 --> 42:29.612
The sweet elixir.
[chuckles]

42:29.614 --> 42:31.047
Whoa, Sancho!

42:33.618 --> 42:35.018
I feel the strength...

42:35.787 --> 42:37.086
of a hundred...

42:38.123 --> 42:41.624
no, a thousand men

42:41.626 --> 42:43.192
coursin' through me!

42:43.194 --> 42:46.129
-[Don Quixote] I feel alive...
-[groaning]

42:46.131 --> 42:48.898
...and new in every sinew.

42:50.936 --> 42:52.201
Oh, Sancho.

42:53.705 --> 42:57.040
We knights-errant
can become callous

42:57.042 --> 42:59.309
to the daily miracles
of our trade.

42:59.311 --> 43:03.313
But this, this is truly

43:03.315 --> 43:05.848
the work of God.

43:06.918 --> 43:10.753
Imbibe the Balsam of Fierbras!

43:11.690 --> 43:13.790
Now, you will feel...

43:13.792 --> 43:15.925
-[Pancho groans]
-...the restorative power

43:15.927 --> 43:18.928
of such a concoction.

43:18.930 --> 43:21.030
The energizing...

43:21.032 --> 43:22.699
-[Pancho gulps]
-...effects...

43:24.002 --> 43:25.768
of the sacred,

43:25.770 --> 43:27.070
invigorating...

43:28.673 --> 43:29.806
elixir!

43:33.078 --> 43:34.711
-[sighs]
-[stomach rumbles]

43:35.847 --> 43:37.847
Oh. I actually feel something.

43:37.849 --> 43:39.749
This... This is working.

43:39.751 --> 43:41.651
Well, did you doubt me?

43:41.653 --> 43:43.186
Well, yeah, but...

43:44.155 --> 43:47.090
Works on ahead.

43:47.092 --> 43:50.093
I feel something.
No, I feel something.

43:51.329 --> 43:54.731
It is indeed a powerful...

43:54.733 --> 43:56.265
-Nope. No.
-...balm.

43:56.267 --> 43:57.700
[Pancho groaning]

43:58.403 --> 44:01.971
[grunting]

44:01.973 --> 44:03.906
-[stomach grumbling]
-[Pancho grunts]

44:05.143 --> 44:07.377
[groans]
I'm dying.

44:09.014 --> 44:12.248
[Pancho yelling, grunting]
I'm dying.

44:13.752 --> 44:16.085
[Don Quixote] Do you not feel...

44:16.087 --> 44:18.221
-it's restorative power?
-[stomach grumbling]

44:19.958 --> 44:21.090
I feel...

44:23.128 --> 44:24.761
-mighty...
-[stomach growls]

44:27.332 --> 44:28.998
...alive.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.833
-[Don Quixote grunts]
-[Sancho coughs]

44:32.070 --> 44:33.670
[Don Quixote groans]

44:34.305 --> 44:35.805
[farts]

44:35.807 --> 44:37.974
The older one
is severely mentally ill

44:37.976 --> 44:42.011
with delusional projections
and extreme narcissism.

44:42.013 --> 44:44.113
[detective]
The younger one, we think,

44:44.114 --> 44:46.214
just suffers from extremely low
cognitive function.

44:47.352 --> 44:50.153
Which is to say,
he is not smart.

44:50.155 --> 44:51.888
Did you ever see
any one of them before?

44:53.425 --> 44:55.224
No.
[clicks tongue]

44:55.226 --> 44:57.427
Don't know 'em.
[sighs]

44:58.129 --> 44:59.796
So, um...

44:59.798 --> 45:01.364
Where... Where do you think
they are now?

45:02.267 --> 45:05.168
Probably, still in the area.

45:05.170 --> 45:06.269
The last sighting was

45:06.271 --> 45:08.771
at the Nighty Knight's Inn
on 61.

45:08.773 --> 45:10.273
That's where one
of the instances

45:10.275 --> 45:12.475
of ritual animal sacrifice
occurred.

45:13.812 --> 45:14.877
[exhales sharply]

45:14.879 --> 45:16.345
Ah. There's no need to worry.

45:18.083 --> 45:19.449
We're just making people aware

45:19.451 --> 45:21.284
and, uh, asking for information.

45:21.286 --> 45:23.086
[chuckles]
Okay.

45:23.088 --> 45:24.353
I'll promise you this,

45:25.890 --> 45:27.190
we don't allow
this kind of thing

45:27.192 --> 45:28.725
in the Parish of St. Bernard.

45:30.428 --> 45:32.395
<i>[detective]We'll have them both</i>
<i> off the streets soon.</i>

45:33.231 --> 45:34.464
<i> One way or another.</i>

45:40.472 --> 45:42.739
[tranquil music]

46:01.526 --> 46:03.793
[tranquil music continues]

46:11.836 --> 46:13.202
Sancho?

46:15.073 --> 46:16.339
Sancho?

46:24.182 --> 46:25.348
Sancho?

46:30.221 --> 46:31.387
Sancho?

46:35.927 --> 46:37.160
[Don Quixote] Sancho?

46:43.434 --> 46:46.803
...approved vacation days,
so today, I'm using one.

46:55.046 --> 46:58.214
[motorcycle revving]

47:00.385 --> 47:02.351
Sancho, where are you going?

47:02.353 --> 47:03.853
I'm going home.

47:03.855 --> 47:05.154
Sancho, I implore you,

47:05.156 --> 47:06.522
do not disappoint yourself.

47:06.524 --> 47:09.325
That cow has already left
the station, I'm going.

47:09.327 --> 47:11.093
Sancho, I command you to stop.

47:11.095 --> 47:12.428
My name is Kevin.

47:12.430 --> 47:14.197
Kevin is my name, okay?

47:14.199 --> 47:15.464
And if you really want me
to stay,

47:15.466 --> 47:17.300
how about you give me
the 155 dollars

47:17.302 --> 47:18.434
you said you'd give me?

47:20.405 --> 47:23.372
If you must know,
I carry no lucre.

47:24.342 --> 47:25.908
What, what is that?

47:25.910 --> 47:27.410
I carry no money.

47:27.912 --> 47:28.978
What?

47:28.980 --> 47:30.947
Knights-errant are above it.

47:30.949 --> 47:32.665
Money is vulgar.

47:32.666 --> 47:34.382
I've never known a knight
to have a single penny.

47:34.385 --> 47:35.551
-[scoffs]
-He has simply given

47:35.553 --> 47:37.253
all that he needs or desires.

47:37.255 --> 47:38.921
Silks, ermines,

47:38.923 --> 47:40.890
precious oils, inuslas, Duchies.

47:40.892 --> 47:42.458
Can you not hear
what you're saying?

47:42.460 --> 47:45.862
Ermines and Ursulas don't...
they're not real, okay?

47:45.864 --> 47:47.396
I'm done! I'm leaving.

47:49.500 --> 47:51.968
Sancho, stop this insolence!

47:51.970 --> 47:54.337
[Don Quixote]
After him, Rosacea!

47:54.339 --> 47:56.439
[Sancho] Leave me alone.

47:56.441 --> 47:58.207
-What do you want?
-Sancho.

47:58.209 --> 48:00.076
I beg you. Please.

48:00.078 --> 48:03.546
The code of chivalry requires,
that I have a squire.

48:03.548 --> 48:05.014
I need you.

48:05.015 --> 48:06.481
[Sancho]
I don't wanna be your squire!

48:06.484 --> 48:08.117
-[Don Quixote] I need you.
-I, I'm gone.

48:10.989 --> 48:13.256
Sancho! Do, do you see it?

48:13.258 --> 48:14.891
Glistening in the sun?

48:15.994 --> 48:17.927
It is the most sought after
relic

48:17.929 --> 48:19.462
in all of knight-errantry.

48:19.464 --> 48:20.663
[Sancho] Not listening!

48:21.633 --> 48:24.533
It is the helmet of Mambrino!

48:24.535 --> 48:26.936
Surely in the hands
of a thief of Lapato!

48:26.938 --> 48:28.104
[Sancho]
This is worse than home.

48:28.106 --> 48:30.206
Come, noble squire!

48:30.208 --> 48:33.442
Here is an adventure
you do not want to miss.

48:34.612 --> 48:37.480
For glory and my squire!

48:37.482 --> 48:39.949
[motorcycle revving]

48:39.951 --> 48:42.418

48:47.392 --> 48:50.026
[Ferdi] What the hell, jackass?

48:50.028 --> 48:51.193
The helmet...

48:52.297 --> 48:53.429
of Mambrino.

48:54.032 --> 48:55.364
[clangs]

48:55.366 --> 48:58.334
[Don Quixote grunting]

48:58.336 --> 48:59.702
[Ferdi] Seriously?

48:59.704 --> 49:01.570
You're stealing
bridal shower gifts?

49:01.572 --> 49:03.472
[panting]

49:03.942 --> 49:05.074
[clanks]

49:05.076 --> 49:06.175
You touch it,

49:06.177 --> 49:07.977
I swear
I'll bash your brains out.

[grunting]

49:19.724 --> 49:22.325
[Don Quixote] Sancho! Sancho!

49:22.327 --> 49:26.095
The helmet,
do not let the infidel

49:26.097 --> 49:28.230
sully the sacred...

49:28.232 --> 49:29.565
[Sancho] I got it, boss!
I got the helmet!

49:29.567 --> 49:31.133
[engine starts]

49:31.135 --> 49:32.735
[whimpering]

49:33.638 --> 49:35.071
[Don Quixote] Sancho!

49:35.073 --> 49:36.672
Here!

49:36.674 --> 49:39.575
The helmet! The helmet!

49:39.577 --> 49:43.045
I dedicate this great victory

49:43.047 --> 49:45.681

49:45.683 --> 49:48.684
of Tabasco!

49:54.993 --> 49:56.292
[tires screeching]

49:56.294 --> 49:58.060
[Sancho] Oh, crap!

49:58.062 --> 49:59.595
[Sancho laughs]

49:59.597 --> 50:01.998
[Sancho] Oh, my god! Yeah!

50:02.300 --> 50:03.716
Yes!

50:03.717 --> 50:05.133
[narrator]
<i> Sancho didn't even wonder why</i>

50:05.136 --> 50:07.403
<i> his master was protected</i>
<i> with two helmets</i>

50:07.405 --> 50:09.171
<i> while he had none.</i>

50:09.173 --> 50:13.409
<i> He was filled with joy</i>
<i>for having done something brave.</i>

50:13.411 --> 50:15.511
[Sancho] Don't know
how you did that! Sweet!

50:18.216 --> 50:21.550
Oh, Sancho,
such squirely behavior.

50:21.552 --> 50:24.020
Your thoughts were only of me!

50:24.022 --> 50:25.121
I don't know
what I was thinking.

50:25.123 --> 50:27.423
The histories
will be kind to you.

50:27.425 --> 50:28.758
Why do you care about history?

50:28.760 --> 50:30.426
You won't even be there
to hear the story.

50:30.428 --> 50:33.162
Oh, sweet, simple Sancho,

50:33.164 --> 50:34.764
this is the story!

50:34.766 --> 50:37.666
Life is a story.
And this one is mine.

50:37.668 --> 50:41.804
I write the dialogue as I speak
and the actions as I move.

50:41.806 --> 50:44.040
The same is true for all men.

50:44.042 --> 50:45.408
Though few ever choose

50:45.410 --> 50:47.410
to cast themselves
as the villain,

50:47.412 --> 50:50.046
many choose to be the victim,
or even worse,

50:50.048 --> 50:51.647
the bystander.

50:51.649 --> 50:53.549
But in this story,

50:53.551 --> 50:58.721
The Ingenious Gentleman,
Don Quixote of La Mancha,

50:58.723 --> 51:00.823
I am the hero!

51:00.825 --> 51:04.093
And, as this is a great
and unlikely story,

51:04.095 --> 51:07.263
I must do great
and unlikely things.

51:07.265 --> 51:10.733
Only a fool sits by
while the music plays!

51:11.702 --> 51:12.768
[gasps]

51:19.444 --> 51:21.310
[Don Quixote] Can you hear it?

51:21.312 --> 51:22.645
I don't hear anything.

51:22.647 --> 51:25.581
[chimes clinking]

51:25.583 --> 51:27.750
I can hear music.

51:27.752 --> 51:31.153
[Don Quixote] It is the voices
of angels, Sancho.

51:31.155 --> 51:34.757
Knights-errant are often lead
by angels in just this fashion.

51:35.393 --> 51:37.226
Come along.

51:37.228 --> 51:39.295
[chimes clinking]

51:41.532 --> 51:43.566

<i> and magic of the world.</i>

53:28.439 --> 53:29.538
It's good.

53:41.786 --> 53:42.985
My god!

53:43.754 --> 53:45.287
It's, it's 155 dollars.

53:45.289 --> 53:46.589
It's exactly how much I needed!

53:46.591 --> 53:47.957
We are not thieves.

53:47.959 --> 53:51.527
Hey, finders are keepers
and losers are wieners,

53:51.529 --> 53:53.963
is, um, what
I'm gonna say to that, so.

53:55.299 --> 53:58.000
"Ode to Lucinda.

53:58.002 --> 54:00.936
Most beautiful creature
in the world.

54:00.938 --> 54:04.873
The moment I saw her,
I knew she was my girl.

54:04.875 --> 54:07.543
She even said she'd rather die,

54:07.545 --> 54:09.845
than ever do another guy.

54:09.847 --> 54:12.881
It was heaven on this rock
we call Earth.

54:12.883 --> 54:14.450
I was filled with mirth.

54:14.452 --> 54:18.687
But when I told Ferdi,
I regretted every wordy.

54:18.689 --> 54:21.757
He was my friend.
But then, he sinned."

54:22.893 --> 54:25.628
What loving heart
and learned mind

54:25.630 --> 54:27.630
could concoct
such beautiful verse?

54:29.367 --> 54:31.834
-[Carl screaming]
-[gasps]

54:32.970 --> 54:35.771
[screaming continues]

54:35.773 --> 54:37.273
Gentle poet, please.

54:42.747 --> 54:43.812
I am no poet!

54:43.814 --> 54:45.648
Did you not write these words?

54:50.655 --> 54:52.921
[Carl screaming]

54:54.325 --> 54:55.891
What is wrong with that guy?

54:56.761 --> 54:57.893
He is a poet.

54:58.763 --> 55:00.062
Mad with love.

55:01.032 --> 55:04.833
He was sent here to me, Sancho,

55:04.835 --> 55:07.503
to teach me, to challenge me.

55:07.505 --> 55:11.340
To remind me of the very heart
of knight-errantry.

55:11.342 --> 55:13.742
For a life
without the torture of love...

55:15.012 --> 55:17.746
is no life at all.

55:24.722 --> 55:27.690
I have long been gone
from the sight of my lady.

55:27.692 --> 55:30.826
She has, no doubt, been tempted

55:30.828 --> 55:34.797
by other men
as was this fallen Lucinda.

55:34.799 --> 55:38.801
Women are not as stable
in their words and deeds

55:38.803 --> 55:40.569
as we men, Sancho.

55:41.839 --> 55:44.440
I could, of course,
return to her

55:44.442 --> 55:46.775
and put my suspicions to rest.

55:46.777 --> 55:49.745
But it will be more heroic
to stay here

55:49.747 --> 55:52.581
and allow those fears
to torment me.

55:53.584 --> 55:55.751
It will be even more poetic

55:55.753 --> 55:57.786
should I die in the act.

55:58.422 --> 56:00.689
[panting]

56:00.691 --> 56:01.924
[Don Quixote grunts]

56:04.428 --> 56:07.529
[Don Quixote] I too
shall write a poem, Sancho.

56:07.531 --> 56:09.131
Take it and this map,

56:09.133 --> 56:12.801
so that you may find my lady.
[panting]

56:13.537 --> 56:14.670
What?

56:14.672 --> 56:16.505
And with your testimony,

56:16.507 --> 56:19.641
bear witness
to the depths of my madness.

56:22.880 --> 56:26.115
And take the Helmet of Mambrino.

56:26.117 --> 56:28.717
Though it is unconventional

56:28.719 --> 56:30.819
for a squire
to don such a helmet...

56:32.656 --> 56:33.856
Yes.

56:35.993 --> 56:37.726
[Don Quixote] I know
that it will protect you.

56:39.764 --> 56:41.830
No one will stop you, Sancho,

56:42.900 --> 56:44.466
no one.

56:44.468 --> 56:46.735
-For we are...
-[paper ripping]

by the way, by cops.

58:05.249 --> 58:06.648
Now, where is he?

58:07.585 --> 58:09.551
No. I'm his squire,

and I, I can't deluge
his secrets.

Hey!

to the lady of the leche.

[Don Quixote] Sancho,
you remember that castle?

1:03:52.596 --> 1:03:55.497
[Sancho] Yeah,
I remember it in my bones.

1:03:55.499 --> 1:03:58.466
I feel it is my gentlemanly duty

1:03:58.468 --> 1:04:03.071
to pay a visit to my old friend,
the lord of that place.

1:04:03.073 --> 1:04:05.340
It was he
who first dubbed me knight.

1:04:06.610 --> 1:04:10.345
I feel rightly obligated
to accept

1:04:10.347 --> 1:04:14.015

he may have of a feast

1:04:14.017 --> 1:04:16.218

1:04:16.220 --> 1:04:20.255
[Janelle] No, no.
Your Grace, the giant awaits!

1:04:20.257 --> 1:04:22.057
[Sancho] Uh, actually,
Your Highness,

1:04:22.059 --> 1:04:25.093
Don Quixote hasn't slept
or eaten in, like, days.

1:04:30.901 --> 1:04:32.567
Rejoice!

1:04:32.569 --> 1:04:36.404

requires a feast.

[Kamil] Your grace.

[Carl]
Well, apparently, you did.

-[all gasp]
-[Don Quixote] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Poet, when you see her now,
do you truly wish her dead?

1:07:47.664 --> 1:07:49.631
-Do you?
-No.

1:07:49.633 --> 1:07:53.201
Death is a easy peace.

of your unfaithfulness

1:07:57.641 --> 1:07:59.274
and her own.

1:07:59.276 --> 1:08:02.811
Besides, there is a true villain
in this tale.

1:08:02.813 --> 1:08:05.447
-And he must be punished.

Ah, broken and shamed,

1:08:10.854 --> 1:08:12.320
[Don Quixote] Such is love.

1:08:12.322 --> 1:08:14.322
Poet, your failure was

1:08:14.324 --> 1:08:16.624
that you ran from your enemy
rather than toward him

1:08:16.626 --> 1:08:18.526
and, thus,
you could never be satisfied.

1:08:18.528 --> 1:08:20.261
This we must remedy.

1:08:20.263 --> 1:08:22.764
You, sir, are indeed a villain.

1:08:22.766 --> 1:08:26.434
However, by sacrificing Lucinda
to her true love,

1:08:26.436 --> 1:08:28.837
by honoring your promise
to this lady,

1:08:28.839 --> 1:08:32.107
And by allowing the poet
to exact his revenge,

1:08:32.109 --> 1:08:33.541
you may yet be redeemed.

1:08:33.543 --> 1:08:35.410
-Revenge?
-Poet!

1:08:35.712 --> 1:08:37.696
Hey!

1:08:37.697 --> 1:08:39.681
[Don Quixote] Exact your revenge
from the very loins

1:08:39.683 --> 1:08:41.516
this scoundrel used

1:08:41.518 --> 1:08:43.384
to betray the honor
of your love.

The other one
you were already taking

1:14:17.887 --> 1:14:19.220

I believe the reason
a knight-errant needs a squire

1:19:32.301 --> 1:19:35.469
is because the world
is simply too mad to face alone.
