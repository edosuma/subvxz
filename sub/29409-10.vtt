I'm not gonna let you get hurt,
I promise.

00:08.758 --> 00:10.677
- How many bribes does it take

00:10.719 --> 00:12.387
to get houses built
on a wildlife corridor?

00:12.429 --> 00:13.930
- You say that one more time
I'll sue you so fast

00:13.972 --> 00:15.765

00:15.807 --> 00:17.350
- It should only take
a few days.

Snares'll take care most
of them,

00:18.810 --> 00:20.562
anything left...
I'll deal with personally.

00:20.603 --> 00:22.313
- I don't need the details
I just need

00:22.355 --> 00:23.606
this wildlife problem
to disappear.

00:23.648 --> 00:25.650
- Consider it done.

- I don't think I'm looking
for the perfect horse.

00:27.402 --> 00:28.778
I think I'm looking
for the right horse.

02:06.084 --> 02:08.627

and have another look.

- Can I come too?

to keep Lyndy occupied

02:50.712 --> 02:52.213

- Where did that come from?

02:53.673 --> 02:54.674

you can cut it with?

02:54.716 --> 02:56.676
- Yeah.

02:56.718 --> 02:57.886
There has never been a snare
on this property.

04:14.879 --> 04:16.423
- Remi got caught in a snare.

04:16.464 --> 04:17.882
- Yeah. It was on pretty tight.

04:17.923 --> 04:19.426
She must have put up
a heck of a struggle.

04:19.466 --> 04:21.928
- Oh! Oh. Easy.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.680
Just, just keep her calm
so I can have a look.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.682
Well, she's lucky she got
her front legs through.

04:25.724 --> 04:27.642
Could have been a lot worse.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.936
- I'd like to get my hands on
the idiot who set a snare

04:29.978 --> 04:32.605
on my fence line.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.733
- I was just talking to Bob
at the reserve,

04:34.774 --> 04:36.651
they're popping up
all over the place.

04:36.693 --> 04:38.737
He's got three wounded wolfs
and a dead coyote.

04:38.778 --> 04:40.697
All injured from snares.
- How can anyone set a trap

04:40.739 --> 04:42.866
that would risk hurting
innocent animals?

04:42.907 --> 04:44.784
- Ah, never mind the how,
I wanna know who?

04:47.537 --> 04:49.080
<i>Jack: You got a minute?</i>

04:49.122 --> 04:51.041
- Well, I'm trying to help Lou
do some canvassing,

04:51.082 --> 04:52.959
if she can get her act together.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.127
But now she's worried
about the dog.

04:54.169 --> 04:56.171
- Ah, the dog is gonna be fine.

04:56.212 --> 04:57.964
But I need a word with you
before you go.

04:58.006 --> 05:00.550
- About what?
- About Mitch.

05:00.592 --> 05:02.677
- Heh. Okay.

05:04.220 --> 05:06.014
- Listen, here is the thing.

05:07.932 --> 05:10.101
I think I dug my heels in
a little too hard

05:10.143 --> 05:12.812
when he asked us to buy
that herd together.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.022
And I've been losing sleep
over it.

05:15.774 --> 05:17.192
- What you getting at, Jack?

05:17.233 --> 05:19.694
- Well, how would you feel
if I asked Mitch

05:19.736 --> 05:21.196
to come back on as a partner?

05:21.237 --> 05:23.156
- Not good. Why?

05:23.198 --> 05:25.950
- Well, because Mitch and Lou
are in a serious relationship.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.994
And this disagreement between us

05:28.036 --> 05:30.205
isn't making things
any easier on them.

05:30.246 --> 05:32.290
Now the three of us
were in this together

05:32.332 --> 05:34.709
and it should've stayed
that way. Mitch is family.

05:34.751 --> 05:36.795

05:36.836 --> 05:38.672
He's not family.

Where is he right now? Hm?

the kids are okay?

05:59.859 --> 06:00.819

she's home.

06:03.988 --> 06:05.198

and I figured you could

10:32.590 --> 10:34.009
these last few shows.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.846
So...you wanted to talk?

10:37.887 --> 10:39.848
- Yeah.
- Interesting.

10:41.307 --> 10:42.892
Because I'm pretty sure you were

10:42.934 --> 10:44.894
quite clear the last time
we spoke.

10:44.936 --> 10:46.146
- I've had some time to think.

10:48.273 --> 10:49.941
It made me realize I needed
to come here

10:49.983 --> 10:52.027
and explain why I said
what I said.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.574
You said you didn't understand
why I quit jumping

10:57.615 --> 11:00.285
and there are a few reasons.

11:00.326 --> 11:03.038
When I got home from Europe,
Phoenix got really sick.

11:03.079 --> 11:05.081
My coach practically
ditched me.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.208
And my parents were pressuring
me to apply to university.

11:09.210 --> 11:10.962
- I mean... I didn't know
any of that.

11:12.297 --> 11:14.090
I'm glad that you told me,
but--

11:14.132 --> 11:16.343
- But the real reason I quit

11:16.384 --> 11:18.678
was because I missed you.

11:22.057 --> 11:24.184
I missed competing with you,

11:24.225 --> 11:25.977
and riding with you,

11:26.019 --> 11:27.562
and laughing with you.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.314
And when the program ended,

11:29.356 --> 11:30.482
I convinced myself
that it would be easier

11:30.523 --> 11:32.359
to make a clean break.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.402
But when I came home...

11:36.237 --> 11:38.073
felt like a piece of me
was missing.

11:40.617 --> 11:42.577
And then, you showed up
and I didn't know what to do.

11:42.619 --> 11:45.121
I'd been trying so hard
to get over you--

11:45.163 --> 11:46.581
- Hey. Hey. All right.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.375
It's okay.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.962
Uh...

11:53.004 --> 11:54.339
I never should have

11:54.381 --> 11:57.384
just shown up like that.

11:57.425 --> 11:59.386
- No, that's-that's not
what I mean.

11:59.427 --> 12:01.680
You shouldn't be sorry
that you showed up at Hudson.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.014
I'm glad you did
because you're right. I'm...

12:04.933 --> 12:07.811
I am terrified of getting hurt.

12:07.852 --> 12:10.230
And...

12:10.271 --> 12:12.273
when ever there's
the slightest chance

12:12.315 --> 12:14.109
of losing something great,

12:14.150 --> 12:15.276
I leave first.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.321
You asked me to give you
a reason to stay.

12:18.363 --> 12:20.365
So just... just listen.

12:24.327 --> 12:27.330
I want you to forget everything
I said in Europe.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.040
How I acted at grad.

12:31.209 --> 12:32.752
I want you to forget
everything because...

12:35.422 --> 12:36.631
because the time I've spent
with you

12:36.673 --> 12:38.299
has been the happiest
I've ever been.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.304
And you make me laugh.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.267
And you call me on my crap.

12:48.727 --> 12:50.311
And you see me for who I am.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.482
And I think that...

12:54.524 --> 12:57.193
I'm love with you.

12:57.235 --> 12:58.319
And I hope that's enough
of a reason.

13:09.247 --> 13:11.207
- (Sniffles)

13:11.249 --> 13:12.792
Do you know how many times
I wanted to hear you say that?

13:14.294 --> 13:15.420
How many opportunities
I gave you to say that?

13:18.423 --> 13:20.425
<i>Announcer: And the standings</i>
<i>are;</i>

13:20.467 --> 13:23.428
<i>Jennifer Sarsa in third place.</i>
<i>Quinn McGregor takes second.</i>

13:23.470 --> 13:26.431
<i>And Taylor Kingstead</i>
<i>gets the first place!</i>

13:26.473 --> 13:29.476
(Crowd applauds)
- Second place...

13:29.517 --> 13:31.269
look at me,
making my dad proud.

13:36.566 --> 13:38.443
I'm sorry...

13:38.485 --> 13:40.445
I should go get my ribbon.

13:44.115 --> 13:48.203
**

13:48.244 --> 13:50.246
- Beat ya.
- Heh. Yeah.

13:50.288 --> 13:52.874

13:57.253 --> 13:59.255
(Horse snorts)

13:59.297 --> 14:00.590
- Hey. You be nice.

14:00.632 --> 14:04.260
(Hooves thud in the foliage)

14:04.302 --> 14:06.221
(Playful nickers)

14:07.722 --> 14:09.474
Settle down.

14:09.516 --> 14:10.517
(Tack jingles)

Spartan.

14:29.327 --> 14:30.412
Ho.

14:31.830 --> 14:33.331
You're such a good teacher.

14:36.668 --> 14:42.424
**

14:44.926 --> 14:46.803
- See you on Election Day.
Thanks a lot.

14:46.845 --> 14:48.388
- Good talking to you, guys.
Man: See you later.

14:48.430 --> 14:50.432
Lou: Wow.

14:52.934 --> 14:54.811
Hey, thank you so much
for coming with me today

14:54.853 --> 14:57.605
and for going door to door -
just everything.

14:57.647 --> 14:59.024
- Of course.
It was my pleasure.

15:00.567 --> 15:01.609
It's fun seeing you in action,
amongst your people.

15:01.651 --> 15:04.195
(Both chuckle)

15:04.237 --> 15:05.530
Seriously, great work.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.574
- Hey, everyone,
good work today.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.701
Um... I don't wanna be too
optimistic,

15:09.743 --> 15:11.703
<i>but I could feel a tide</i>
<i>turning.</i>

15:11.745 --> 15:12.704
<i>People are starting</i>
<i>to question J.D's message.</i>

15:12.746 --> 15:14.539
- Yeah, I'll keep my eyes open.
Thanks, Bob.

15:14.581 --> 15:17.459
- Hey buddy.
- Hey.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.419
- You look like you could use
a coffee.

15:19.461 --> 15:21.171
- Yes, thank you.

15:21.212 --> 15:23.256
So you know that snare
that Remi was caught in?

15:23.298 --> 15:24.841
- Yeah.

15:24.883 --> 15:26.718
- Well, people are finding them
everywhere now.

15:26.760 --> 15:27.719
Especially along Gibson Creek.
- Gibson creek?

15:27.761 --> 15:30.388
That's J.D's development?

15:30.430 --> 15:31.765
- And I was just talking to Bob,

15:31.806 --> 15:33.767
and he said the police
are now involved.

15:33.808 --> 15:35.727
They think all the snares
are made by the same person.

15:35.769 --> 15:37.896
- I don't believe this.

15:37.937 --> 15:41.441
J.D. practically admitted to me
that he bribed his way

15:41.483 --> 15:43.193
into getting that development
built,

15:43.234 --> 15:45.403
in spite of the wildlife
corridor it disturbed.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.654
And now this is happening...?

15:46.696 --> 15:48.782
That's it.

15:48.823 --> 15:50.367
- Whoa-whoa-whoa.
What are you doing?

15:50.408 --> 15:51.951
- I'm gonna talk to him.

15:51.993 --> 15:53.912
- Don't-don't go stirring up
a bee's nest. Okay?

15:53.953 --> 15:55.789
Or let's-let me come with you
then.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.707
- The last thing I want
is for J.D. to think

15:57.749 --> 15:59.250
I need a man to protect me.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.882
(Footsteps thud)

16:05.924 --> 16:07.342
(Low hum of chatter,
traffic rumbles)

16:07.384 --> 16:08.510
(Car door slams)

16:10.637 --> 16:12.430
- Do you need something?

16:12.472 --> 16:13.765
- A straight answer...

16:13.807 --> 16:15.809
if that's even possible.

16:15.850 --> 16:18.770
- Well, it's kind of hard
to give an answer

16:18.812 --> 16:20.772
when I don't know the question,
Lou.

16:20.814 --> 16:23.066
- All right. I think
it's more than strange

16:23.108 --> 16:25.485
that the second that article
came out about your development

16:25.527 --> 16:27.696
displacing wildlife,

16:27.737 --> 16:29.948
said wildlife has started
turning up, injured or worse.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.826
And not just wild animals,
but innocent pets,

16:32.867 --> 16:35.328
like our dog.
- Well, that's not a question.

16:36.037 --> 16:37.789
- I'm sure you know
that the police

16:37.831 --> 16:39.082
are looking into this, right?

16:39.124 --> 16:41.668
And they're bound to figure out
who's behind it all.

16:41.710 --> 16:43.461
- If I thought you were any
kind of a threat,

16:43.503 --> 16:45.463
I'd go directly to my lawyers

16:45.505 --> 16:47.799
and I'd have you sued
for slander.

16:47.841 --> 16:50.677
Which is exactly what I'll do
if you continue down this path.

16:50.719 --> 16:52.220
(Tires screech)

16:55.557 --> 16:56.766
Quit while you're behind,
Ms. Fleming.

16:56.808 --> 17:00.186
- Very funny.
Not a chance.

17:04.315 --> 17:08.528
**

17:08.569 --> 17:10.530
- I told you.
Don't come to my office.

17:10.571 --> 17:12.574
- I want the rest of my money.
I think I've done enough.

17:12.615 --> 17:15.617
- You've done more than enough.
Get rid of the snares

17:15.660 --> 17:17.537
before the cops
trace them back to you.

17:17.579 --> 17:19.497
From now on,
stick to the rifle.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.540
<i>Don't mess this up.</i>

17:21.583 --> 17:23.251
<i>You got it?</i>

17:25.962 --> 17:28.506
- Hey, you're okay.
- (Nickers)

17:28.548 --> 17:30.258
See? It's not gonna hurt you.

17:32.052 --> 17:33.762
It's okay. It's okay.
(Approaching engine rumbles)

17:33.803 --> 17:35.805
(Nickers)
- You're fine.

17:35.847 --> 17:38.516
(Nervous snorts)

17:38.558 --> 17:40.560
Hey, what're you guys
doing here?

17:40.602 --> 17:41.978
- Well, you missed dinner.

17:42.020 --> 17:43.855
So we brought you a picnic.

17:43.897 --> 17:45.732
And we wanted to see how you're
doing with your new horse.

17:45.774 --> 17:47.692
- He's not my new horse...
not yet.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.861
I'm working on it.

17:49.903 --> 17:51.279
Come here. Look.

17:52.655 --> 17:55.241
See? Spartan doesn't mind.

17:56.701 --> 17:57.744
It's not gonna hurt you.

17:57.786 --> 17:59.788
Come on, let's try again.

17:59.829 --> 18:02.290
(Scared whinny, hard kick)

18:02.332 --> 18:03.500
No! Spartan!
(Panicked exhales)

18:03.541 --> 18:05.001
- Lyndy, stay here.

18:05.043 --> 18:07.587
(Spartan nickers)
(Nervous exhales)

18:08.880 --> 18:11.758
I... I am so sorry.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.468
I promised him I wouldn't
let anything happen to him,

18:13.510 --> 18:14.844
and look!
- Hey-hey-hey.

18:14.886 --> 18:17.389
- It's okay.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.473
- It's all right, Amy.
It's just a bruise.

18:20.725 --> 18:22.519
- That horse could have
broken his leg!

18:22.560 --> 18:24.771
- He didn't, Amy.

18:24.813 --> 18:27.315
- I'm sorry, boy.
I'm so sorry.

18:32.696 --> 18:34.030
(Phone chimes)
- Georgie's home.

18:34.072 --> 18:38.618
- Hm. God, I still don't know
how I feel

18:38.660 --> 18:41.454
about her taking that trip.
- (Small laugh)

18:41.496 --> 18:43.832
You only met Quinn for
15 minutes at Georgie's grad.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.458
I've gotten to know him
a little

18:45.500 --> 18:46.876
and... I like him.

18:46.918 --> 18:48.336
I hope it works out for them.

18:48.378 --> 18:50.797
It's not easy, you know...

18:50.839 --> 18:52.757
meeting the right person.

18:54.592 --> 18:56.052
- No, it isn't.

18:56.094 --> 18:57.637
- (Smirks)
(Door opens and shuts)

18:59.848 --> 19:01.933
- Hey.
- There she is!

19:01.975 --> 19:03.643
- You made it!

19:03.685 --> 19:05.270
- Dad! Did I wake you, guys?

19:05.311 --> 19:06.771
- No, no, no.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.898
We-we've been waiting for you.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.275
- Okay. I'm just gonna grab
something from the fridge

19:10.316 --> 19:11.693
there is nothing in the loft.

19:11.735 --> 19:14.279
- Okay. How did it go?

19:15.947 --> 19:19.284
Georgie?
- How was the trip, honey?

19:21.578 --> 19:23.538
- (Emotional exhales)

19:25.999 --> 19:27.542
Lou: Everything go okay?

19:28.835 --> 19:30.712
Georgie?

19:30.754 --> 19:32.380
- (Crying)

19:34.632 --> 19:36.634
It's not gonna work I...

19:36.676 --> 19:38.511
I messed everything up.

19:38.553 --> 19:40.055
- What?

19:40.096 --> 19:42.432
Georgie? Oh honey!

19:42.474 --> 19:44.559
(Sobbing)

19:47.020 --> 19:49.564
(Crickets chirp)
(Wolf howls in the distance)

19:52.817 --> 19:54.652
(Sinister music)

19:55.862 --> 19:57.739
(Rope creaks)

19:59.824 --> 20:00.742
(Ferocious snarling)

20:04.704 --> 20:06.831
(Growls)
(Paws patter)

20:06.873 --> 20:10.585
(Sinister music)

20:10.627 --> 20:14.422
(Low snarling, barks)

20:15.924 --> 20:17.926
(Stressed exhale)

20:21.179 --> 20:22.806
- Well, thank you so much
for your support.

20:22.847 --> 20:24.432
You won't regret it.

20:24.474 --> 20:25.892
(Chuckles) Yeah. You bet.
Okay.

20:25.934 --> 20:27.936
(Beeps phone off)

20:27.977 --> 20:30.105
- So I just talked to Adam.

20:30.146 --> 20:32.148
Apparently his dad said
the investigation

20:32.190 --> 20:33.900
is at a stand-still.

20:33.942 --> 20:35.568
And they can't find anymore
snares.

20:35.610 --> 20:37.529
Like even the ones
that were reported earlier

20:37.570 --> 20:38.822
were gone when the police
showed up.

20:38.863 --> 20:40.573
- Oh, I don't believe this.

20:40.615 --> 20:42.158
Werth iss gonna get away
with it.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.202
(Approaching engine rumbles)

20:44.244 --> 20:46.579
Oh, good Mitch is here.
He can help.

20:52.669 --> 20:54.754
(Reel rattles)

20:57.132 --> 20:59.843
- Hey!
- Hey.

20:59.884 --> 21:01.094
- You ah, you wanted to talk?

21:01.136 --> 21:04.806
- No. I wanted to fish.

21:07.017 --> 21:08.560
Another rod there,
help yourself.

21:13.815 --> 21:15.817
- (Phone chimes) What?!

21:15.859 --> 21:18.111
- What? What is it?

21:18.153 --> 21:21.823
- Mitch. He's here...
with grandpa... fishing.

21:21.865 --> 21:24.617
- Wha--we're all in here
working

21:24.659 --> 21:26.828
and he's literally gone
fishing?!

21:26.870 --> 21:28.788
- Yeah. I, I don't know
what's going on.

21:28.830 --> 21:31.207
- I do.

21:31.249 --> 21:32.917
Jack's trying to talk him back
into the business.

21:32.959 --> 21:35.337
Without me.
- Dad!

21:39.007 --> 21:41.593
- You know, I always find
that fishing

21:41.634 --> 21:43.970
is about the best way
to clear your mind.

21:44.012 --> 21:46.973
You can think
about what's important.

21:47.015 --> 21:49.684
You can consider the past

21:49.726 --> 21:51.853
and plan for the future.

21:51.895 --> 21:54.314
- What are you getting
at there, Jack?

21:54.356 --> 21:57.108
- Well, I'm hoping we'll be
able to smooth over

21:57.150 --> 21:59.611
this cattle business situation.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.738
And settle our issues.

22:01.780 --> 22:03.865
- We don't have any issues.

22:03.907 --> 22:05.658
But I gotta tell you, I'm doing
pretty good on my own.

22:05.700 --> 22:07.952
- Yeah. I knew you would.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.663
But I'm kinda thinking that
we'd stronger together.

22:12.874 --> 22:14.793
- Seriously, they-they wanna
hush this out right now?!

22:14.834 --> 22:16.670
In the middle of my campaign!

22:16.711 --> 22:18.296
I'm putting an end to this.

22:18.338 --> 22:20.131
- They need a neutral
mediation, I think.

22:20.173 --> 22:21.966
- Peter! Don't get involved
in that!

22:22.008 --> 22:23.677
- Don't worry.
I'll be Switzerland!

22:23.718 --> 22:25.595
Tim: Ah-ha!

22:25.637 --> 22:27.138
My worst nightmare.

22:27.180 --> 22:29.766
Right here.
I knew it. I knew it.

22:29.808 --> 22:31.726
You're trying to sneak
Jack away,

22:31.768 --> 22:33.061
make a deal behind my back,
huh?

22:33.103 --> 22:34.854
- Jack invited me.

22:36.314 --> 22:39.109
- Really?
- (Exhales)

22:39.150 --> 22:41.653
- Another traitor in my midst,
speaking of betrayal,

22:41.695 --> 22:43.279
what about the way
you're treating Lou, huh?

22:43.321 --> 22:45.824
She needs your help,
you're not helping.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.034
Everybody knows this election
is important to her.

22:48.076 --> 22:50.036
Even Peter is here to help her.

22:50.078 --> 22:52.580
And you know what, he is ready,
willing, and able, buddy!

22:52.622 --> 22:54.416
- Peter's here?
- Yep.

22:55.625 --> 23:00.005
**

23:00.046 --> 23:01.589
- (Nickers)
- (Clucks her tongue)

23:01.631 --> 23:03.216
Come on. Hey!
- (Nickers)

23:03.258 --> 23:06.136
Come on, get in the trailer.

23:06.177 --> 23:08.972
Hey. (Irritated grunt)
Get in there, you.

23:09.014 --> 23:11.558
(Clucks her tongue)

23:11.599 --> 23:13.601
(Hooves thud in the foliage)

23:15.812 --> 23:17.397
Let's go. It'll be okay.

23:19.774 --> 23:22.027
(Clucks her tongue)
Ha! Ha! Ha!

23:24.529 --> 23:26.948
<i>(Amy exhales)</i>

23:26.990 --> 23:29.242
(Nickers)
(Engine rumbles)

23:29.284 --> 23:30.994
(Door opens, shuts)

23:31.036 --> 23:33.204
(Frustrated exhale)
Hey.

23:33.246 --> 23:35.290
- Hey, what's going on?

23:35.331 --> 23:37.375
- I just thought I would bring
him to Heartland.

23:37.417 --> 23:39.336
He might be less distracted
there if he can't see the herd.

23:39.377 --> 23:41.296
It's not going well.

23:41.338 --> 23:43.590
- Well, let me give you a hand.
- Thanks.

23:48.595 --> 23:50.430
<i>(Nervous whinny)</i>

23:52.223 --> 23:55.352
- (Clucks her tongue)
- Hup! Hup!

23:55.393 --> 23:57.979
Hup!
- Oh no! Ty! The gate.

24:00.023 --> 24:01.274
<i>(Amy shouts) Go!</i>

24:01.316 --> 24:03.860
Fine just go!
Get out of here!

24:03.902 --> 24:05.695
- Amy?

24:05.737 --> 24:08.031
What's going on?
I can go get him you know.

24:08.073 --> 24:09.991
- No. Just let him go!
It's for the best.

24:10.033 --> 24:11.910
I don't want him anyway!

24:11.951 --> 24:14.079
(Horse whinnies
in the distance)

24:15.789 --> 24:17.457
- You know what, Tim,
doesn't matter anyways.

24:17.499 --> 24:19.542
I don't wanna be in business
with somebody like you.

24:19.584 --> 24:21.670
- Okay. You know--
- You don't-you don't wanna
do that.

24:21.711 --> 24:23.129
No insults just--
- Okay.

24:23.171 --> 24:24.714
Please, would you all
just listen--

24:24.756 --> 24:26.299
- Pete, stay out of this one.
Okay?

24:26.341 --> 24:28.426
- I would love to stay out
of it, but here is the thing;

24:28.468 --> 24:31.012
these guys gave you the
opportunity to begin with.

24:31.054 --> 24:32.806
Right? So turning your back
on them now,

24:32.847 --> 24:34.683
it's a little low Mitch.
So you should rethink it.

24:34.724 --> 24:36.142
<i>Tim: That's the truth.</i>

24:36.184 --> 24:37.811
- I don't think this is any
of your business.

24:37.852 --> 24:39.312
- Okay, let's leave Peter
out of this.

24:39.354 --> 24:41.189
- You know what is my business?
Lou.

24:41.231 --> 24:43.108
You have any idea how hard
she's been working?

24:43.149 --> 24:45.235
What she's up against?
You don't. You know why?

24:45.276 --> 24:47.153
Because you're around, are you?
- What about you?

24:47.195 --> 24:50.073
- What about me?
- You show up when ever you
want,

24:50.115 --> 24:51.282
interfering in our relationship,

24:51.324 --> 24:53.159
cozying up next to Lou...
- What?!

24:53.201 --> 24:54.285
- even though you've been
divorced for years?

24:54.327 --> 24:56.287
- Okay. This is not the place
to talk about this.

24:56.329 --> 24:58.456
- Lou and I have a fantastic
relationship.

24:58.498 --> 25:00.458
Do you wanna know why?
Because we work hard at it!

25:00.500 --> 25:02.419
I know that's probably a
foreign concept to you, right?

25:02.460 --> 25:04.713
Because whenever things get
challenging, you disappear!

25:04.754 --> 25:06.256
Don't you, Mitch?
- Yeah.

25:06.297 --> 25:08.216
Did I leave my wife and kids
and go to Vancouver?

25:09.801 --> 25:11.636
- 'Scuse me?

25:15.181 --> 25:17.017
I'm there for her
when she needs me.

25:17.058 --> 25:18.685
That's more than I can say
about you.

25:18.727 --> 25:20.311
<i>Lou: Okay! Enough!</i>

25:20.353 --> 25:22.564
Obviously none of you know
what I need.

25:22.605 --> 25:24.399
Because if you did, you'd know
that all I want right now

25:24.441 --> 25:26.443
is a family that I can
depend on

25:26.484 --> 25:28.236
during the scariest and most
nerve-wracking time

25:28.278 --> 25:30.238
of my entire life!

25:30.280 --> 25:32.365
- You're right.
- Listen, I'm sorry--

25:32.407 --> 25:34.743
- No, don't!
- Whoa! Oh!

25:36.703 --> 25:38.955
(Exhales)

25:38.997 --> 25:40.749
- She's got my vote.

25:43.084 --> 25:45.795
- Are you sure you're okay?

25:45.837 --> 25:47.839
- I don't know.

25:50.425 --> 25:52.969
- Why don't you talk me
through this? Okay?

25:53.011 --> 25:55.305
Is it Luke leaving?
Is that why you're upset?

25:55.347 --> 25:57.098
- Of course I'm upset
about Luke, but...

25:58.850 --> 26:00.143
- And Remi getting hurt
didn't help either.

26:00.185 --> 26:01.436
- No, it's...

26:01.478 --> 26:04.189
it's not just that, Ty.
Um...

26:06.983 --> 26:08.276
I guess I'm afraid.

26:09.486 --> 26:12.155
- Of what?

26:12.197 --> 26:13.948
- I'm afraid I'm gonna lose
Spartan.

26:15.867 --> 26:18.203
He is the last link
I have with my mom.

26:18.244 --> 26:20.705
And...

26:20.747 --> 26:22.874
every time I look at him I...

26:22.916 --> 26:24.084
I can see her...

26:25.960 --> 26:29.089
Ty, she died, saving him.

26:31.091 --> 26:33.259
And now, he's getting old

26:33.301 --> 26:34.928
and I have to face that.
And I just...

26:38.014 --> 26:40.308
I don't know what I'm gonna do
without him?

26:41.893 --> 26:43.853
I don't wanna say goodbye
to him?

26:43.895 --> 26:45.730
- You're not gonna have to,
Amy.

26:45.772 --> 26:47.357
Spartan's ligament has healed.

26:47.399 --> 26:49.234
We're gonna treat his
arthritis.

26:49.275 --> 26:52.028
He's gonna be around
or a long, long time.

26:52.070 --> 26:54.072
You're not gonna have to say
goodbye anytime soon, okay?

26:54.114 --> 26:55.990
- Okay.

26:58.118 --> 26:59.119
Okay. (Sniffles)

27:02.872 --> 27:04.708
You know...

27:04.749 --> 27:07.043
I am sad...

27:07.085 --> 27:08.753
that Luke had to go.

27:12.632 --> 27:14.342
- Well, that's the way
it always had to be.

27:17.262 --> 27:18.972
We have our own little family.

27:19.014 --> 27:21.099
- I love our little family.

27:21.141 --> 27:23.143
I do.

27:23.184 --> 27:24.769
- He'll come visit.

27:26.229 --> 27:28.565
Especially when we get
this house built.

27:28.606 --> 27:31.234
I can't wait...
- I know, me too.

27:31.276 --> 27:33.611
See Lyndy run around
and play here.

27:33.653 --> 27:36.197
- Yeah, have her own little
horse,

27:36.239 --> 27:37.699
riding over these hills.

27:40.035 --> 27:41.327
She's so lucky to grow up here.

27:41.369 --> 27:43.329
- Yeah.

27:45.040 --> 27:46.416
We all are.

27:46.458 --> 27:49.669
- Hm. Speaking of the house.

27:51.421 --> 27:53.465
I gotta get some clean up done
before Lee arrives tomorrow.

27:53.506 --> 27:56.134
Otherwise this moving in thing
isn't gonna happen.

27:56.176 --> 27:57.719
- Okay.
Thanks for chatting.

27:59.095 --> 28:01.056
(Horse whinnies
in the distance)

28:01.097 --> 28:02.223
- I love you.
- I love you too.

28:07.103 --> 28:08.938
You can have a meltdown
with me anytime.

28:08.980 --> 28:10.357
Okay? You just let me know.

28:10.398 --> 28:13.360
(Both laugh)
- Thanks.

28:20.492 --> 28:21.951
(Footsteps crunch, exhales)

28:21.993 --> 28:24.579
(Sinister music)

28:24.621 --> 28:26.414
- (Panting echoes)

28:29.209 --> 28:32.170
- Amy!

28:32.212 --> 28:34.047
(Gunshot pops)

28:34.089 --> 28:36.508
Get down!

28:36.549 --> 28:40.178
(Gunshots pop)

28:40.220 --> 28:41.471
Agh!
(Gunshot pops)

28:41.513 --> 28:43.431
Agh!

28:47.268 --> 28:49.312
(Amy whimpers)
- Amy, you okay?

28:49.354 --> 28:52.190
- (Pained moan)
- Amy, Amy!

28:52.232 --> 28:54.651
Hey... you're gonna be okay.
Okay?

28:54.693 --> 28:57.946
- (Pained moan)
- Okay. Sit up.

28:57.987 --> 28:59.030
Sit up.
- (Pained grunts)

28:59.072 --> 29:01.032
Come on.

29:01.074 --> 29:02.575
Okay.
- (Pained moan)

29:02.617 --> 29:04.452
- I got you.

29:04.494 --> 29:06.121
I got you.

29:08.581 --> 29:10.583
You're gonna be okay.

29:10.625 --> 29:13.086
Hold the gauze on there
tightly, Amy.

29:13.128 --> 29:15.338
- I am.

29:15.380 --> 29:17.632
(Tires skid)

29:17.674 --> 29:19.300
(Engine roars)

29:22.345 --> 29:24.139
<i>It's okay. Here we are.</i>

29:24.180 --> 29:25.557
Here we are.

29:25.598 --> 29:27.350
Okay.

29:27.392 --> 29:29.978
Stay right there, Amy!
Help!

29:30.020 --> 29:31.312
My wife has been shot!
Please.

29:34.357 --> 29:36.317
It's okay, Amy.
It's okay. It's okay.

29:37.652 --> 29:39.696
They got you.
They got you.

29:39.738 --> 29:42.282
You're okay now.
You're okay.

29:42.323 --> 29:44.617
You're okay.
(Pained grunt) Ugh!

29:44.659 --> 29:46.411
- Please. Stop!

29:46.453 --> 29:48.288
- It's okay.
That's my wife!

29:48.329 --> 29:50.165
- Sir!
- Let me go! Please let me go!

29:50.206 --> 29:52.208
- Sir, you're bleeding!
- That's my wife's blood.

29:52.250 --> 29:53.960
- No. You've been shot.
- What?

29:56.921 --> 29:58.173
- I need assistance!

30:01.259 --> 30:02.969
I need help!

30:05.597 --> 30:10.477
**

30:10.518 --> 30:12.062
- Why haven't we heard
anything yet?

30:12.103 --> 30:13.646
- Well...

30:13.688 --> 30:16.191
- Dad and grandpa said
they'd call, okay?

30:16.232 --> 30:18.193
(Phone rings)

30:18.234 --> 30:20.278
(Beeps phone on)
- Jack...

30:20.320 --> 30:21.946
how are they?

30:23.281 --> 30:25.200
Okay. Yeah.

30:25.241 --> 30:26.493
They are?!

30:26.534 --> 30:28.370
They're both gonna be okay.

30:31.498 --> 30:32.624
<i>Yeah. Okay.</i>

30:32.665 --> 30:34.459
Your dad wants to talk to you.

30:34.501 --> 30:36.294
Okay, I will.

30:36.336 --> 30:38.380
All right you're on speaker.
Tim: Now listen, everyone!

30:38.421 --> 30:39.881
<i>Amy and Ty are gonna be fine.</i>

30:39.923 --> 30:42.467
<i>You gotta make Lou go</i>
<i>to her final rally.</i>

30:42.509 --> 30:45.470
- Dad! I'm not going,
I can't give that speech today!

30:45.512 --> 30:47.514
<i>Tim: The last thing</i>
<i>Amy and Ty want</i>

30:47.555 --> 30:49.516
<i>is to ruin your campaign.</i>

30:49.557 --> 30:51.643
<i>Remember why you're running,</i>
<i>Lou. Don't give up now.</i>

30:51.685 --> 30:54.062
<i>Are you ready to go?</i>

30:56.606 --> 30:58.483
- Yeah Dad, I'm ready.
- (Lisa chuckles)

30:58.525 --> 31:00.360
- Just give her five minutes,
Tim.

31:00.402 --> 31:01.403
(Beeps phone off)

31:02.612 --> 31:05.281
(Calming exhale)

31:05.323 --> 31:07.117
(Door opens)

31:07.158 --> 31:08.660
- Dad.

31:08.702 --> 31:11.371
- Jack stayed with Ty and Amy.

31:11.413 --> 31:13.456
- So what happened?

31:13.498 --> 31:15.458
- They got caught
in the cross fire

31:15.500 --> 31:16.835
between a poacher and a wolf.

31:16.876 --> 31:18.670
- Why was somebody hunting
on their property?

31:18.712 --> 31:19.713
- I-I don't know.
I don't know.

31:19.754 --> 31:23.216
Ty didn't see the guy,
but he saw a white truck

31:23.258 --> 31:24.759
pull out of there.
- Wait, wait - a white truck?

31:24.801 --> 31:26.344
Did it have a red topper?
- Apparently.

31:27.595 --> 31:29.889
Lou...?

31:29.931 --> 31:32.350
I-just wait I have to make
a phone call.

31:32.392 --> 31:33.768
(Dialing beeps)

31:33.810 --> 31:36.688
Yes, hello. May I please
speak to Jim parker,

31:36.730 --> 31:37.439
the chief of police...

31:37.480 --> 31:41.151
- Uh, excuse me... folks. Hi.

31:41.192 --> 31:42.193
I'm...

31:42.235 --> 31:43.778
Tim Fleming, I'm Lou's father,

31:43.820 --> 31:46.448
but I'm also her campaign
manager.

31:46.489 --> 31:47.782
Uh...

31:47.824 --> 31:50.744
<i>she's just gotta make a quick</i>
<i>phone call.</i>

31:50.785 --> 31:52.787
- Okay. Thank you.
Tim: You may remember me

31:52.829 --> 31:55.540
from the Hudson Rodeo
association election. No?

31:55.582 --> 31:57.709
- Thanks, Dad.
- Okay.

31:57.751 --> 31:59.294
- I have a speech to make.
- Okay.

32:00.420 --> 32:02.464
- Hi everyone.

32:02.505 --> 32:05.342
I am so glad to have you
all here with me,

32:05.383 --> 32:06.760
and with my family.

32:06.801 --> 32:08.762
It means a lot.

32:08.803 --> 32:10.847
The message of my campaign

32:10.889 --> 32:13.224
has always been about
integrity.

32:13.266 --> 32:15.852
It's been about moving forward
with the kind of progress

32:15.894 --> 32:19.606
that honours the values and
the traditions of our town.

32:19.647 --> 32:21.483
It's been about protecting
what's important to us

32:21.524 --> 32:23.234
and to our families.

32:24.569 --> 32:26.529
To say that I'm from a big
family

32:26.571 --> 32:27.614
would be an understatement.

32:27.655 --> 32:30.950
<i>I'm a granddaughter,</i>
<i>a daughter,</i>

32:30.992 --> 32:33.661
<i>a mother, a sister,</i>
<i>an ex-wife.</i>

32:35.789 --> 32:37.040
<i>My family is big,</i>

32:37.082 --> 32:39.876
<i>and it is definitely</i>
<i>not free from conflict.</i>

32:39.918 --> 32:42.879
But I am nothing
if not loyal to my family.

32:42.921 --> 32:46.466
And that family
includes this town.

32:47.926 --> 32:50.220
<i>And when someone threatens</i>
<i>that family,</i>

32:50.261 --> 32:52.931
tries to hurt them,
tries to take them down,

32:52.972 --> 32:55.392
you can bet that I will be
there and ready to fight.

32:55.433 --> 32:56.768
Crowd: Yeah.

32:56.810 --> 32:57.769
- J.D. Werth is that threat...

32:57.811 --> 33:00.814
to my family, and to my town.

33:00.855 --> 33:05.443
And I promise
that I will do my best

33:05.485 --> 33:07.654
to defend us to the end.

33:07.696 --> 33:08.780
<i>So thank you for being here</i>
<i>with me today,</i>

33:08.822 --> 33:11.866
and for helping me to realize

33:11.908 --> 33:14.786
that this is not only
what I want to do,

33:14.828 --> 33:16.496
but what I have to do.

33:17.580 --> 33:21.418
(Applause)

33:21.459 --> 33:23.461
- Thank you.

33:23.503 --> 33:24.462
(Applause)
Peter: All right! Yeah!

33:25.630 --> 33:27.549
Woo!

33:42.939 --> 33:45.608
Jack: Hang on you guys.
I-I'll help you.

33:45.650 --> 33:47.235
Amy: It's okay, Grandpa.

33:48.445 --> 33:49.946
(Doors shut)

33:49.988 --> 33:52.490
- Hi Sweetheart. Hi.
- Hi Mommy.

33:53.742 --> 33:55.535
- I missed you.

33:56.703 --> 33:59.914
Hey Remi. Hey.

33:59.956 --> 34:01.833
- Easy. Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah. I-I'm okay.

34:01.875 --> 34:03.877
- Come sit down.

34:03.918 --> 34:05.837
- Here is a little pie,
for our hero.

34:05.879 --> 34:07.630
- Thank you, Lisa.
- The super hero!

34:07.672 --> 34:09.716
- I'm not a hero, guys.
- Yes, you are.

34:09.757 --> 34:11.717
You heard what the doctor said.

34:11.760 --> 34:13.511
If you hadn't jumped in front
of that bullet

34:13.553 --> 34:15.054
it would've hit me straight on.

34:15.096 --> 34:17.599
- You saved Amy's life, Ty.
Don't doubt that.

34:19.768 --> 34:21.895
- So uh, the police made any
progress or...?

34:21.936 --> 34:24.522
- We haven't heard anything.

34:24.563 --> 34:25.982
I wish I would have seen
the guy's face.

34:26.024 --> 34:27.817
But I did see
the license plate.

34:27.859 --> 34:29.319
So hopefully something
will come of that.

34:29.360 --> 34:30.779
- I'm sure it will.

34:33.322 --> 34:36.701

34:43.458 --> 34:45.793

(Gunshot pops)
(Pained grunts)

34:49.880 --> 34:51.466

34:57.889 --> 35:00.225
- Are you okay?

35:02.477 --> 35:04.354
- Yeah, I'm okay.

35:04.396 --> 35:08.983
**

35:09.025 --> 35:10.610
If anything would have
happened to you...

35:12.612 --> 35:13.571
if I'd lost you... Amy--
- No. Hey...

35:15.740 --> 35:16.741
you didn't.

35:16.783 --> 35:18.576
I'm okay.

35:21.579 --> 35:22.789
I'm okay because of you.

35:26.501 --> 35:28.336
I'm fine.

35:29.838 --> 35:34.676
**

35:34.718 --> 35:36.678

35:36.720 --> 35:38.346
Tim: Okay. It's time.

35:39.764 --> 35:40.765
There should be some initial
results.

35:40.807 --> 35:43.643
(Anticipating exhale)

35:44.978 --> 35:46.730

Crowd: Aww.

35:46.771 --> 35:48.982
- He's gonna win.

35:49.024 --> 35:50.775
- Early days. Early days.
- Okay.

35:58.992 --> 36:00.535
- I think someone's here
to see you.

**

36:09.878 --> 36:12.339
- Sorry to drop in like this...
again.

36:15.884 --> 36:17.927
- What are you doing here?

36:17.969 --> 36:20.722
- Well, the question I've been
asking is why did you leave?

36:20.764 --> 36:23.058
You just disappeared on me
in Kelowna.

36:23.099 --> 36:24.934
- I didn't seem like you wanted
me there.

36:24.976 --> 36:26.978
And neither did your friend.

36:27.020 --> 36:29.314
- What friend?

36:29.356 --> 36:30.482
- The girl that you were with.

36:32.734 --> 36:34.986
- Wait? Her?

36:35.028 --> 36:36.946
No. No. She-she's just a friend.

36:36.988 --> 36:38.073
Like, like an actual friend.

36:38.114 --> 36:40.658
She's not somebody
that I'm seeing.

36:42.869 --> 36:45.622
She's not you.

36:45.663 --> 36:46.748
- What?

36:49.209 --> 36:52.504
- I-I realized a lot of things
when I left Hudson.

36:53.880 --> 36:54.964
Mainly, that I didn't
have a plan.

36:55.006 --> 36:57.884
I was just...

36:57.926 --> 36:59.678
doing what my parents
wanted me to do,

36:59.719 --> 37:00.762
not, not what I wanted to do.

37:02.931 --> 37:04.140
When I was working with you,

37:04.182 --> 37:07.185
I realized how much I loved
coaching.

37:07.227 --> 37:10.438
It might be the thing
I actually want to do.

37:12.732 --> 37:14.401
- That's great,

37:16.111 --> 37:19.864
but is that why you came here?
To tell me that?

37:19.906 --> 37:20.782
- No.

37:27.997 --> 37:29.582
I came here to tell you
that Hillhurst stables

37:29.624 --> 37:32.460
offered me a coaching job
here in Hudson.

37:34.004 --> 37:34.713
And I'm gonna take it.

37:36.006 --> 37:38.800
But only if you want me to.

37:41.761 --> 37:42.971
Just give me a reason
to stay and I will.

37:45.015 --> 37:51.479
**

37:53.982 --> 37:56.484
- Well, look who it is.

37:58.194 --> 37:59.654
What you doing outside?
Come on in... golden boy.

38:03.575 --> 38:05.076
- Golden boy?

38:05.118 --> 38:08.872

- (Chuckles) Okay.

38:08.913 --> 38:10.957
(Low hum of chatter)

38:10.999 --> 38:12.625
- Okay. Final results
should be in.

38:12.667 --> 38:13.835
- Okay.

for your support.

- Are you kidding me?
Of course.

- Hey! I-I won!

38:40.153 --> 38:42.697
- Of course you did!
Congratulations!

You brought it!
Oh, Dad.

39:06.721 --> 39:09.933
* I'll be there for you *

39:09.974 --> 39:11.726
- Yeah. Well, thank you so much
for calling, Jim.

39:13.269 --> 39:15.814
Well, I'm just glad my tip
was helpful.

39:15.855 --> 39:17.565

Okay. You take care.

- He's a good boy.
- Yes.

39:24.406 --> 39:26.574
He's a very good boy.
- Looks good out there I mean...

39:30.787 --> 39:33.540
- Hey,

39:33.581 --> 39:35.709
you see this?
- I did.

39:35.750 --> 39:37.168
- They got Werth.

39:37.210 --> 39:40.880
Apparently his henchman,
Grady, squealed.

39:40.922 --> 39:43.341
- That's great news.
- Yeah.

39:43.383 --> 39:45.969
I mean, he's saying that
he was just aiming at a wolf.

39:46.011 --> 39:47.887
And he didn't even see
Amy and Ty.

39:47.929 --> 39:49.097
But you know, who knows?
Right?

39:50.890 --> 39:51.933
(Sighs) What's up?

39:54.352 --> 39:55.895
- You didn't say girlfriend.

39:57.105 --> 39:59.274
- What?

39:59.315 --> 40:01.151
- In your speech the other
night, you know, you...

40:01.192 --> 40:03.945
you said mother,

40:03.987 --> 40:05.113
daughter, granddaughter,

40:06.531 --> 40:08.700
you said ex-wife...

40:08.742 --> 40:10.326
didn't say girlfriend.

40:10.368 --> 40:13.079
- I'm sure I did? Didn't I?

40:14.706 --> 40:16.416
I don't even remember
what I said...

40:16.458 --> 40:19.336
I-I mean, that speech was
totally made-up on the spot.

40:19.377 --> 40:21.171
- Listen, I gotta be honest
with you,

40:21.212 --> 40:23.798
I just, I feel lately
like I am...

40:23.840 --> 40:25.425
on the outside looking in.

40:27.260 --> 40:29.721
- Well, you kind of have been.

40:31.139 --> 40:33.391
You know, I mean,
Peter wasn't far off

40:33.433 --> 40:34.893
when he called you out
down at the pond...

40:36.936 --> 40:38.730
- Well, you know what,

40:38.772 --> 40:41.191
maybe Peter is the only support
you need right now.

40:41.232 --> 40:43.735
And that's fine.
That's great.

40:43.777 --> 40:45.153
I think that's really great.
You should go for it.

40:46.696 --> 40:48.365
At least until you figure out

40:48.406 --> 40:49.824
what it is that you
really want.

40:51.951 --> 40:53.828
- Maybe you need to figure
that out as well.

40:57.665 --> 40:59.626

40:59.668 --> 41:01.378
