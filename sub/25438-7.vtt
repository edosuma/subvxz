to see Bruno Sammartino
fight Stan Hansen.

04:31.813 --> 04:35.358
It was at Madison Square Garden,
and halfway through the match,

04:36.150 --> 04:39.195
Hansen did this body slam,
but-- but you could tell that

04:39.279 --> 04:41.447
Sammartino didn't land right, and...

04:41.948 --> 04:43.908
I just remember
in the papers the next day,

04:43.992 --> 04:47.161
there were these photos of him
with a neck brace and...

04:48.538 --> 04:49.956

04:52.417 --> 04:54.335

04:54.502 --> 04:57.130
Maybe I shouldn't have pushed
the wrestling so hard, you know?

04:57.714 --> 05:00.842
Well, we all knew what we were signing
up for. Even Ruth.

05:01.551 --> 05:02.802
Maybe it's just a sprain.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.263

Okay. Time for a Klonopin.

Hey, you already gave her a Valium.

05:12.437 --> 05:13.771
Okay, half a Klonopin?

05:15.398 --> 05:16.441

05:16.899 --> 05:18.985
[shouts] Why is this taking so long?

05:19.235 --> 05:22.822

-You're my Shirley MacLaine.
-And the first pill just kicked in.

05:28.786 --> 05:31.748
[sighs] Good news.
We'll have a bed ready soon.

05:31.831 --> 05:35.543
So, I'll take her back,
and all of you can leave?

05:35.710 --> 05:37.045
-Not a chance.
-[Sam] Hey.

05:37.128 --> 05:39.714
What the fuck is going on?
Why is she still waiting?

05:39.922 --> 05:42.967

06:23.132 --> 06:26.511
-I was trying to help.
-You helped. We all saw it.

06:27.303 --> 06:30.515
Sam's just... you know, stressed.

06:31.516 --> 06:34.685
You know, but you are right.
He is a pretty big fucking asshole.

06:35.311 --> 06:37.355
Half a Klonopin? Take the edge off?

06:37.688 --> 06:39.190
No. Thank you.

06:39.649 --> 06:42.944
Can, uh, someone at least call me
and let me know how she's doing?

06:46.531 --> 06:48.449
That was so scary
and it could've happened to me.

06:48.533 --> 06:50.284
-Or me. Or both of us.
-[both] Or both of us.

06:50.368 --> 06:51.202
Oh!

06:51.285 --> 06:53.496
It's like that movie <i>Ice Castles.</i>

06:53.913 --> 06:56.249
Where the small-town girl
with big talent

06:56.332 --> 06:59.168
gets lured into this world
of skating competitions.

06:59.335 --> 07:00.753
And then she goes blind.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.755
And then she has to skate blind,
and she does.

07:02.839 --> 07:05.341
[crying] And then there are these roses,
but she can't see them...

07:05.425 --> 07:09.470
Yeah, whatever. Fuck that movie.
It happened to Joe Theismann last Monday.

07:09.887 --> 07:12.265
One minute you're dropping backwards
to pass the ball,

07:12.348 --> 07:14.642

You know, it is good that Sam was
still filming, though.

12:45.681 --> 12:46.515
[Carmen] Here.

12:47.224 --> 12:49.602
Ruth doesn't have insurance.
We don't know what to fill out.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.647
How could she not have insurance?
She's a professional wrestler.

12:53.731 --> 12:56.192
Yeah. Employed
by Bash Howard Productions.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.902
Who doesn't provide health care.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.446
How many of you don't have insurance?

13:03.908 --> 13:07.244
-My parents pay for mine.
-We do stunts and don't have a death wish.

13:08.329 --> 13:10.080
Okay. This is my responsibility,

13:10.164 --> 13:12.541
and I will take care of it.
[clears throat]

13:40.402 --> 13:41.862
This place gives me the creeps.

13:43.030 --> 13:44.073
Want a Nutter Butter?

13:44.615 --> 13:46.784
Oh, no. I'm good. I'm good. Thanks.

13:48.661 --> 13:51.288
I failed out of med school. So...

13:52.039 --> 13:54.208
this place brings out a lot
of bad feelings.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.961
What? You-- you went to med school?

13:57.044 --> 13:59.213
Uh, yeah. [scoffs]

14:00.005 --> 14:02.925
When I wasn't wrestling, I was studying,
but...

14:03.509 --> 14:05.678
You didn't notice
I always had books with me?

14:06.136 --> 14:11.058
No. But I-- I really don't pay attention
to all of you. I...

14:15.354 --> 14:17.273
Can't you take classes? Get back in.

14:18.691 --> 14:22.194
I don't want to get back in.

14:23.070 --> 14:25.948
I only did it in the first place
to make my parents happy.

14:26.240 --> 14:30.494
I'm just so tired of trying
to make other people happy.

14:31.996 --> 14:32.872
Yeah.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.834
I let my mother slowly deteriorate
in a place like this.

14:39.336 --> 14:41.964
Instead of dying on a beach in Italy
like she wanted.

14:44.800 --> 14:45.843
I'm sorry.

14:47.511 --> 14:50.472
I just thought that the game was living
as long as possible,

14:50.556 --> 14:53.267
instead of dying on your own terms.

14:54.977 --> 14:57.897
-[scoffs] Big fucking mistake.
-Hmm.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.233
-Yeah.
-[sighs]

15:02.151 --> 15:03.193
I'll take a cookie.

15:20.794 --> 15:21.795
[sighs]

15:24.214 --> 15:25.049
Thank you.

15:25.507 --> 15:27.301
Sam bought them. To share.

15:29.595 --> 15:30.429
Any update?

15:31.555 --> 15:33.015
Well, she's getting an X-ray.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.267
They think it's just a sprain.

15:35.351 --> 15:40.105
-[scoffs] A bad fucking sprain.
-Look, she's not dying, okay?

15:40.731 --> 15:42.983
It's after midnight. Everyone's tired.

15:43.817 --> 15:47.237
So, why don't you go back to the motel?
You did a great show tonight.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.740
Great? We were amazing.

15:50.783 --> 15:53.118
Well, up until the ankle.

15:54.745 --> 15:57.164
You think we'll get
our old time slot back, Sam?

16:02.044 --> 16:02.878
No.

16:04.296 --> 16:05.130
I don't.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.217
I think we're gonna die at two a.m.

16:10.052 --> 16:12.096
But we'll die on our own terms, right?

16:15.140 --> 16:16.517
Fuck, yes, we will.

16:17.518 --> 16:21.105
Okay, come on, crybabies.
I'll drive everybody.

16:21.188 --> 16:24.400
Get drunk while we ice our fucking knees,
let's go.

16:24.483 --> 16:27.027
-[Sheila] I don't wanna leave Ruth alone.
-She's not alone.

16:27.152 --> 16:29.989
Bash and I are here. Don't worry.
We'll bring her back.

16:31.532 --> 16:32.408
Come on.

16:36.620 --> 16:37.705
I'll see you at home.

16:38.998 --> 16:39.873
[Sam] Okay.

16:48.215 --> 16:49.466
She's in room three.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.183
[sighs]

17:07.735 --> 17:09.945
How are you, um, feeling?

17:12.740 --> 17:14.908
I don't know. Melrose gave me a Valium.

17:16.326 --> 17:18.662
God, that sounds good.
Do you have another one?

17:24.626 --> 17:26.754
-Oh. Hello there.
-Hi.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.256
Well, it's good news.

17:29.339 --> 17:31.717
Oh, my God! Really?
I'm so relieved.

17:36.221 --> 17:38.974
You see right here? It's a clean fracture.

17:39.099 --> 17:43.270
Just snapped right in two, but there are
no bone splinters, nothing shattered.

17:43.353 --> 17:45.814
I hate when the bone shatters.
You gotta find all the pieces.

17:45.981 --> 17:49.610
This is such a beautiful break. A+.

17:50.778 --> 17:54.031
So, we'll get you going with a cast,
and then you'll be on crutches

17:54.114 --> 17:57.534
for eight weeks. Ten at the most.
All right?

17:58.494 --> 18:00.454
Someone will be by to get that started.

18:03.415 --> 18:04.416
[door closes]

18:05.793 --> 18:07.002
God, it's not that long.

18:09.171 --> 18:10.005
It's...

18:10.547 --> 18:13.050
the rest of the season.
I won't be on the show.

18:14.176 --> 18:16.637
I mean, well,
we're getting canceled anyway, so...

18:17.304 --> 18:19.556
And, you know, it's just a job.

18:21.642 --> 18:22.851
No, it's not!

18:24.019 --> 18:25.437
Okay. Jesus.

18:25.687 --> 18:29.775
I worked ten years to get a job
that was more than just

18:29.858 --> 18:34.613
a-- a crappy one-line role.
It's never easy for me.

18:35.823 --> 18:39.243
You're the one who walks in
and gets whatever job she wants.

18:39.326 --> 18:41.954
Okay, you don't have to lash out at me.
Um...

18:43.747 --> 18:44.706
Yeah.

18:45.165 --> 18:48.043
-I did not mean to break your ankle.
-I don't believe you.

18:48.168 --> 18:49.711
No, Ruth. No, no, no.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.047
No, it was an accident, Ruth.

18:52.756 --> 18:53.841
Unlike the time...

18:56.135 --> 19:00.764
[yelling] ...you "accidentally"
fucked my husband twice!

19:02.474 --> 19:04.810
How about the time you

19:05.144 --> 19:09.022
"accidentally" made out
with your co-star, what's-his-face

19:09.106 --> 19:13.277
at your stupid <i>Paradise Cove </i>wrap party,
and I didn't tell anyone.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.987
Are you fucking kidding me?

19:15.112 --> 19:17.030
That's completely different,
and you know it!

19:17.114 --> 19:19.116
[crying] You know what? I don't care.

19:19.408 --> 19:21.910
I don't care anymore.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.788
I have eaten shit for months.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.416
I have done everything I can think of
to make this right.

19:27.499 --> 19:29.251
-You can't make it right.
-Great.

19:29.334 --> 19:30.544
Then I'll stop trying.

19:31.128 --> 19:33.672
I am so tired

19:33.755 --> 19:35.799
of apologizing about Mark.

19:36.550 --> 19:38.969
And you didn't love him enough
to stay married to him.

19:39.052 --> 19:41.305
I'm not married to him
because he fucking cheated on me!

19:41.388 --> 19:42.472
You never loved Mark.

19:42.556 --> 19:45.267
You don't have the right to say
a fucking word about my marriage!

19:45.851 --> 19:49.188
Do I have a right to talk
about your power complex?

19:49.605 --> 19:51.815
Or do I have to schedule a meeting
with all the producers?

19:51.899 --> 19:53.692
Oh, I earned my title.

19:53.775 --> 19:55.694
Right. Your work ethic is legendary.

19:55.777 --> 19:59.364
You wanna talk about how you sabotaged
my date with Russell?

19:59.531 --> 20:02.034
Even though you know

20:02.117 --> 20:04.745
I haven't wanted to go on a date
with someone in years.

20:04.828 --> 20:07.956
Yeah, forgive me if I don't feel bad
about that, at all.

20:09.958 --> 20:11.335
Let's talk about how you thought

20:11.418 --> 20:14.254
I should let myself be raped
to save our show.

20:14.338 --> 20:17.090
-The show you don't give a shit about!
-You're so fucking melodramatic!

20:17.174 --> 20:20.052
[stammers] What are-- I care
about the show just as much as you do.

20:20.135 --> 20:21.845
No, you don't!

20:21.929 --> 20:24.598
You needed a distraction!

20:24.681 --> 20:28.268
[sobbing]
And big surprise! You got what you wanted.

20:29.019 --> 20:32.564
You could have slapped me
and walked away.

20:33.398 --> 20:36.818
But instead, you took the one thing I got.

20:38.153 --> 20:41.740
I don't have what you have. I never have.

20:41.823 --> 20:45.160
Yeah, here we go. I miss this.
Poor Ruth, she doesn't have anything.

20:45.244 --> 20:48.121
So, Deb, be careful.
Just downplay all your accomplishments.

20:48.205 --> 20:52.376
Just pretend all the things you worked
so fucking hard for don't matter at all,

20:52.459 --> 20:54.878
because she's gonna feel sad
and insecure about her life

20:54.962 --> 20:58.173
and suck all the joy out of every moment
that you have. Poor, poor Ruth.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.968
Right, right, you're the success,
and I'm the disaster.

21:01.051 --> 21:03.679
-That's how it's always been.
-I never made you feel like a disaster.

21:03.762 --> 21:04.680
You did!

21:05.055 --> 21:06.682
Every time we saw each other,

21:06.765 --> 21:09.268
you'd draw it all out.

21:09.810 --> 21:12.729
Make me give you all the details,

21:12.813 --> 21:16.942
every shitty audition,
the horrible dates. We'd... we'd...

21:17.401 --> 21:22.364
We can roll around in all
of my failures and mistakes.

21:22.447 --> 21:26.451
And then you could go home to your house

21:26.743 --> 21:29.413
and your family and your life!

21:30.205 --> 21:33.458
And feel comfortable
with every choice you ever made,

21:33.542 --> 21:35.502
even though you were miserable.

21:35.794 --> 21:37.921
-No, I was happy.
-Bullshit!

21:38.255 --> 21:39.172
Fuck you!

21:42.884 --> 21:45.095
[sobbing]

21:51.685 --> 21:53.478
Hey, what's the prognosis?

21:54.062 --> 21:55.147
Fucking broken.

21:57.733 --> 21:59.860
I never felt so guilty about anything.

21:59.943 --> 22:01.862
Jesus! You live a charmed life.

22:01.945 --> 22:03.363
Thought I was gonna have
a wrestling show,

22:03.447 --> 22:05.032
and no one was gonna get injured?

22:05.115 --> 22:07.659
What the fuck is wrong with me?
I destroyed our little family.

22:07.743 --> 22:09.244
I mean, Ruth is a gimp.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.330
You know what,
just don't be so hard on yourself.

22:11.413 --> 22:13.123
She'll go on to live a full life.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.467
[door opens]

22:27.637 --> 22:30.015
Jesus, fuck. Sorry, sorry.

22:31.558 --> 22:33.977
Uh, I thought you were all out
getting wasted.

22:34.936 --> 22:35.771
I don't drink.

22:36.688 --> 22:37.522
Right.

22:39.316 --> 22:40.150
I, um...

22:40.901 --> 22:44.279
Can you, um,
bring Ruth some of her clothes,

22:44.613 --> 22:48.075
so she doesn't have to leave
the hospital in a leotard?

22:52.829 --> 22:54.498
Sheila, um...

22:55.540 --> 22:59.586
So, I know what this looks like
from the outside, but, um...

23:00.420 --> 23:01.421
I'm-- I'm not...

23:02.714 --> 23:05.425
[crying] I'm not trying
to destroy Ruth's life, okay?

23:06.676 --> 23:09.221
This isn't some elaborate revenge fantasy.

23:11.765 --> 23:14.309
-Hey, are you okay?
-I don't know. I don't know.

23:14.434 --> 23:16.061
Ruth and I had a fight, and...

23:17.145 --> 23:17.979
I'm sorry.

23:19.981 --> 23:20.899
My parents fight.

23:22.609 --> 23:26.071
They stockpile years of ammunition
and then, one day...

23:26.863 --> 23:27.781
unload it all.

23:29.199 --> 23:30.033
Yeah.

23:30.367 --> 23:32.828
God, it's so weird
to think of you having parents.

23:34.621 --> 23:37.707
Yeah, I keep waiting for them
to get divorced. They never do.

23:38.959 --> 23:40.419
They always end up back together.

23:40.794 --> 23:41.628
Yeah.

23:54.891 --> 23:56.351
You should bring the clothes.

24:05.318 --> 24:06.653
All right. [sniffles]

24:08.405 --> 24:09.906
Does she have anything cuter?

24:29.050 --> 24:32.304
I won't be needing these anymore.
You should give them to Justine.

24:32.387 --> 24:37.184
-She'd make a great replacement Zoya.
-Relax. I'm not giving your part away.

24:37.392 --> 24:41.688
Well, you have to, if you want
to keep the story moving forward.

24:42.063 --> 24:44.649
Who cares? It's just a TV show.

24:44.733 --> 24:48.320
[laughs] Everyone keeps saying that.

24:49.654 --> 24:52.407
It... It's not to me.

24:53.742 --> 24:58.288
I have people now, people who come
with me to the ER. People who...

24:59.206 --> 25:00.790
care if I'm hurt.

25:03.043 --> 25:03.877
I know.

25:05.670 --> 25:08.840
I'm sorry. It's just the easiest thing
to say, you know?

25:12.844 --> 25:14.304
[sighs] How's this?

25:16.806 --> 25:18.934
I don't want to make this show
without you.

25:20.227 --> 25:22.229
I'm not gonna make this show
without you.

25:24.606 --> 25:26.233
I thought we're all replaceable.

25:27.359 --> 25:28.818
Well, you're not.

25:33.448 --> 25:36.117
I got markers! And I paid your bill.

25:37.244 --> 25:39.996
Oh, Bash, you didn't have to do that.

25:40.080 --> 25:43.291
Yes, I did,
'cause you couldn't possibly afford it.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.835
-And I felt so guilty. May I?
-Yeah.

25:48.588 --> 25:52.634
A Bash Howard...

25:53.468 --> 25:56.096
Production.

25:56.429 --> 25:57.347
[chuckles]

26:07.857 --> 26:10.026
-SS?
-It's my initials.

26:11.528 --> 26:14.948
You-- Could you clarify
that it's not a Nazi reference?

26:15.031 --> 26:17.075
Maybe draw a heart around it
or something?

26:17.158 --> 26:19.202
Wow! Fucking sensitive.

26:21.621 --> 26:23.498
"F" for Francis.

26:24.874 --> 26:25.750
Aw.

26:34.217 --> 26:37.262
I thought you might want to leave
the hospital with pants on.

26:46.563 --> 26:47.439
Uh...

26:48.189 --> 26:52.319
As you may have heard,
Ruth and I got into a really big fight.

26:52.402 --> 26:53.987
-Oh, everybody heard.
-Yeah.

26:54.070 --> 26:56.948
Yeah, the cashier at the gift shop
couldn't stop talking about it.

26:57.073 --> 27:02.454
Right. Well, I'm glad we gave them a show,
since we never got to finish our match.

27:03.121 --> 27:04.372
[Bash] All right, look.

27:04.456 --> 27:07.125
Prior to the bone snapping,
that wrestling was unreal!

27:08.209 --> 27:11.921
But we gotta tone it down, okay?
I can't afford everyone getting injured.

27:12.005 --> 27:14.591
[whispers] I could afford two more people
getting injured.

27:14.716 --> 27:16.551
-Okay.
-[clears throat]

27:17.052 --> 27:18.345
So, what's the plan, Sam?

27:19.262 --> 27:20.138
You know what?

27:21.181 --> 27:23.058
We got four episodes left, right?

27:23.391 --> 27:27.354
Fuck it. No one's watching.
No one cares. Ruth can't even walk.

27:33.860 --> 27:35.320
I hope you guys have fun.

28:08.269 --> 28:11.231
Can we hire Reggie back?

28:11.314 --> 28:12.399
Who?

28:17.195 --> 28:18.029
I'm kidding.

28:19.280 --> 28:20.365
Yeah, who cares?

28:20.907 --> 28:22.992
Bring the Viking back to the sinking ship.
