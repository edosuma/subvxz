00:07.841 --> 00:09.777
Yo, shit is late.

00:09.877 --> 00:11.512
Yeah, they still
vialin' up.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.981
Usually come off
the train street-ready,

00:14.082 --> 00:15.183
but this time
they gotta vial.

00:15.283 --> 00:17.151
Y'all got
any testers, man?

00:17.251 --> 00:19.019
- Yeah, later.
- Later?

00:19.120 --> 00:20.588
Y'all got
any testers, man?

00:20.688 --> 00:22.690
Nigga, it ain't even 9:00
and you fiendin' on it.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.692
Get the fuck
out of here, man.

00:24.792 --> 00:27.361
Damn.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.230
Yo, why you act
like that, yo?

00:29.330 --> 00:32.031
What, for these
junkie motherfuckers?

00:32.133 --> 00:33.401
So, you just gonna
take his money all day

00:33.501 --> 00:34.802
and treat him
like a dog?

00:34.902 --> 00:36.003
How I'm supposed
to treat him?

00:36.104 --> 00:37.438
I don't know.

00:37.538 --> 00:38.839
But you ain't got
to punk 'em like that.

00:38.939 --> 00:40.040
He punked hisself.

00:40.141 --> 00:41.375
He a goddamn
drug addict.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.611
And you a goddamn
drug dealer.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.045
So?

00:45.146 --> 00:47.281
So what?

00:47.381 --> 00:50.618
Oh, what, the customer's
always right?

00:50.718 --> 00:52.353
Yo, we in
the projects.

00:52.453 --> 00:54.155
The customer
be fucked up.

00:54.255 --> 00:56.190
You can't give
these niggas shit, man.

00:56.290 --> 00:58.692
Why not?
Why can't you?

00:58.792 --> 01:01.462
Shit, everything else
in the world get sold

01:01.562 --> 01:03.464
without people
taking advantage.

01:03.564 --> 01:06.367
Scammin', lyin',
doin' each other dirty.

01:06.467 --> 01:09.036
Why it got to be
that way with this?

01:09.137 --> 01:10.938
'cause they dope fiends.

01:11.038 --> 01:14.475
Yeah, but the game
ain't gotta be played
like that, yo.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.444
You can't tell me
this shit can't get done

01:16.544 --> 01:18.479
without people
beatin' on each other,

01:18.579 --> 01:21.649
killin' each other,
doin' each other like dogs.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.584
Without all that

01:23.684 --> 01:26.320
you ain't got five-oh
down here on our backs
every five minutes,

01:26.420 --> 01:28.789
throwin' us around
and shit.

01:28.889 --> 01:30.391
Shit, man.

01:30.491 --> 01:32.860
You think five-oh would care
about niggas gettin' high?

01:32.960 --> 01:34.528
In the projects?

01:34.628 --> 01:37.531
Man, five-oh be down here
about the bodies, yo.

01:37.631 --> 01:40.334
That's what they be
down here about, the bodies.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.336
Squires,
young squires.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.372
Ah, what you want,
nigga?

01:44.472 --> 01:48.209
A little bag o' styles, man.
A little bag o' styles for you.

01:48.309 --> 01:51.379
Check it out,
check it out.

01:51.479 --> 01:52.580
( laughing )

01:52.680 --> 01:54.982
Only five dollars.

01:55.082 --> 01:56.850
What's up with that?

01:56.950 --> 01:59.720
Five dollars make you
a gallant motherfucker,
right there, boy.

02:02.690 --> 02:04.492

What are we facing
from the riot?

03:58.306 --> 03:59.707
Three witnesses'
statements.

03:59.807 --> 04:02.209
All of them saying
the officer's assault

04:02.310 --> 04:03.744
on the youth
was unprovoked.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.546
You know how that goes,
Commissioner.

04:05.646 --> 04:08.316
People's idea
of police brutality is
whenever we win a fight.

04:08.416 --> 04:10.484
What does
the state's attorney say?

04:10.584 --> 04:11.685
He says it goes
to a grand jury.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.354
That's him doing
Pontius Pilate.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.556
The grand jury
doesn't indict,

04:15.656 --> 04:17.024
he looks clean
for passing the buck.

04:17.124 --> 04:18.291
And if they
do indict?

04:18.392 --> 04:19.793
They won't.

04:19.892 --> 04:22.229
Criminal histories
on our three witnesses...

04:22.330 --> 04:25.132
one longer
than the next.

04:25.232 --> 04:28.235
Drugs, weapons, assault,
more drugs.

04:28.336 --> 04:30.371
Shitbirds throwing dirt
at good police.

04:30.471 --> 04:33.607
Just the same, Lieutenant,
I want you to rethink

04:33.707 --> 04:36.777
whatever tactic
led you to send three
plainclothes officers

04:36.877 --> 04:39.513
to do field interviews
at the high-rises

04:39.613 --> 04:42.583
at 2:00 in the morning.

04:42.683 --> 04:43.851
Yes, sir.

04:43.951 --> 04:47.154
I take it your people
have union counsel?

04:47.254 --> 04:48.756
Yes, sir.

04:48.856 --> 04:52.760
Sir, I would request that
pending the grand jury review,

04:52.860 --> 04:56.397
Officer Pryzbylewski be placed
on administrative leave.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.599
I can use him in-office,
but I don't think

04:58.699 --> 05:01.168
we should have him
on the street until
the grand jury signs off.

05:01.268 --> 05:02.403
That's putting our tail
between our legs.

05:02.503 --> 05:04.405
I think our
official stance

05:04.505 --> 05:07.508
has to be he did
nothing wrong out there.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.543
A 14-year-old
is half-blind.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.211
And two of ours
were injured as well.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.613
Goddamn right.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.415
They were fucking
shooting at us out there.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.984
Bobby,
what do you think?

05:17.084 --> 05:21.188
Keep 'em off the streets
until it clears the courthouse.

05:21.288 --> 05:24.558
Okay, then, we wait
on the grand jury.

05:30.464 --> 05:33.000
Lieutenant.
A moment, please.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.872
What happened
out there?

05:38.972 --> 05:43.444
Did you know they were in
the high-rises without backup?

05:46.179 --> 05:49.617
I tell you yes,
I screwed up.

05:49.717 --> 05:53.521
I tell you no, I'm putting
my men in the jackpot.

05:53.621 --> 05:56.089
Do you still
want me to answer?

06:02.430 --> 06:03.864
I screwed up, sir.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.999
It's a good man that's willing
to take one for the company.

06:06.099 --> 06:07.267
Hell with
the company.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.070
I'm defending my own
people here, that's all.

06:10.170 --> 06:12.440
What Major Valchek
means to say

06:12.540 --> 06:14.842
is that he's grateful that
you extended your support

06:14.942 --> 06:17.845
on behalf of
Officer Pryzbylewski.

06:17.945 --> 06:19.046
Fuck-up that he is.

06:19.146 --> 06:20.247
He should be
off the street.

06:20.347 --> 06:21.449
What can I say?

06:21.549 --> 06:22.850
The kid needs
a little guidance,

06:22.950 --> 06:24.384
a little supervision.

06:24.485 --> 06:26.754
Stan here thought that
if he got a young officer

06:26.854 --> 06:29.122
back on the street where
he might start over...

06:29.222 --> 06:32.259
A new unit,
a new lieutenant.

06:32.359 --> 06:33.727
That might
bring him around.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.295
I understand
he messed up here.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.064
I understand that.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.933
Which is why
I'm saying to you,

06:40.033 --> 06:43.771
I owe you for walking
him through this
grand jury thing.

06:43.871 --> 06:46.440
And to compensate,
Southeastern is sending you

06:46.540 --> 06:49.510
two new unmarked units
and a surveillance van.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.545
Plus, you need manpower

06:51.645 --> 06:53.947
while these guys are busy
with this IID thing,

06:54.047 --> 06:56.349
all you do is ask.

06:56.450 --> 06:58.452
Lieutenant.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.124
So, I got suction
with you, Valchek?

07:04.224 --> 07:06.026
That's what I'm saying.

07:07.528 --> 07:10.798
Deputy,
always a pleasure.

07:18.371 --> 07:21.208
A necessary evil.

07:21.308 --> 07:22.776
What?

07:22.876 --> 07:23.944
Valchek.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.914
Is it insubordinate
if I ask what's so necessary?

07:28.616 --> 07:31.384
Thanks for not cutting
Pryzbylewski loose.

07:31.485 --> 07:33.286
If you had,
the department
would be caught

07:33.386 --> 07:35.022
between Valchek
and city hall.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.824
I owe you for that.

07:36.924 --> 07:40.393
This Barksdale,
he's dug in.

07:40.494 --> 07:42.963
It may take more
than buy-bust.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.932
And since it's been
in the press about
the witness--

07:45.032 --> 07:46.800
It's not an issue.

07:49.269 --> 07:50.871
Keep it a tight
little circle.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.540
Give me three weeks
of good street work

07:52.640 --> 07:54.174
and you'll
see this through.

07:54.274 --> 07:56.409
A couple of felony warrants,
a little dope on the table.

07:56.510 --> 07:59.580
That's all
we need here.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.249
Under no circumstances
is it accurate to suggest

08:02.349 --> 08:05.953
that this particular homicide
was the result of the victim

08:06.053 --> 08:09.122
having been a witness
in an earlier case.

08:09.222 --> 08:12.960
Reports to the contrary
are without factual merit.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.629
Are you saying that
you know definitely

08:15.729 --> 08:18.932
that this man was not killed
because he testified?

08:19.032 --> 08:21.068
We think, that--
I mean, that is...

08:21.168 --> 08:23.837
we're looking into the
possibility that Mr. Gant

08:23.937 --> 08:26.139
was involved
in a street dispute.

08:26.239 --> 08:29.009
Which, of course,
would have nothing to do

08:29.109 --> 08:33.413
with his being a witness
in an unrelated case
that concluded weeks ago.

08:33.513 --> 08:37.083
Reporter:
But you haven't developed
a suspect at this time?

08:37.183 --> 08:38.818
No, we haven't.

08:38.919 --> 08:42.690
Ah, bunk,
shame on you, lad.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.658
What'd you
expect him to do?

08:44.758 --> 08:46.226
I don't know,
grab the mic,

08:46.326 --> 08:47.761
shove Rawls
to the ground

08:47.861 --> 08:49.697
declare that all of Baltimore
should rise as one,

08:49.797 --> 08:51.765
because they're
murdering witnesses
in cold blood.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.868
That sounds more like
one of your moves.

08:56.937 --> 09:01.341
Been working on him
two weeks and we don't
even have a photo.

09:01.441 --> 09:03.043
It's fucking
embarrassing.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.680
- Hey, Pat.
- Huh?

09:06.780 --> 09:08.982
We got a job
for you guys to try
to run down.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.117
What is it?

09:10.217 --> 09:12.052
We need a photo
of this guy Barksdale.

09:12.152 --> 09:14.254
We need to know
what he looks like.

09:14.354 --> 09:15.656
So, go down
to the B of I.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.057
Well, you see,
that's the problem, guys.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.392
You see, Barksdale's never
been arrested as an adult,

09:19.492 --> 09:21.394
so, we don't really
have a B of I photo.

09:21.494 --> 09:23.396
And his juvenile record
he had expunged,

09:23.496 --> 09:25.198
so there's no photo
there either.

09:25.298 --> 09:26.600
Then you're fucked.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.136
- ( chuckling )
- Yeah.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.704
Yeah, we are.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.706
But seeing as we all
came into work today,

09:32.806 --> 09:34.942
I thought, what the hell,
let's try something different.

09:35.042 --> 09:38.779
So, we know from his mother's
social service record

09:38.879 --> 09:42.716
that Barksdale grew up
in Franklin Terrace, right?

09:42.816 --> 09:45.485
Well, it occurred to me,
being vaguely familiar

09:45.585 --> 09:47.688
with the high-rises
of West Baltimore,

09:47.788 --> 09:50.590
that the housing project
began to take photos

09:50.691 --> 09:53.861
of every registered resident
as a security measure.

09:53.961 --> 09:56.096
Am I correct,
Detective Greggs?

09:56.196 --> 09:57.297
Yeah.

09:57.397 --> 09:59.399
So, you want us to go down
to the housing department

09:59.499 --> 10:01.168
and pull his photo.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.469
Excellent.

10:02.569 --> 10:03.937
You know, you and I,
we think as one.

10:04.037 --> 10:06.406
We're like two horses
together in a harness.

10:06.506 --> 10:07.941
( laughs )

10:08.041 --> 10:10.844
Why don't you fucking
do it yourself?

10:10.944 --> 10:12.846
Sure, if you don't mind
sitting in my desk,

10:12.946 --> 10:15.115
reviewing homicide folders,
taking meticulous notes,

10:15.215 --> 10:17.317
trying to run down
a few new leads.

10:17.417 --> 10:19.086
It's boring,
painstaking work,

10:19.186 --> 10:21.088
but if you don't
want to travel to
the housing department,

10:21.188 --> 10:23.123
I'll switch with you.

10:24.958 --> 10:28.929
Fuck it, Patrick,
let's take a ride.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.236
( clearing throat )

10:37.304 --> 10:38.706
That was inspiring.

10:38.806 --> 10:41.074
I'm a leader of men.

10:41.174 --> 10:43.844
( music playing )

10:49.382 --> 10:52.419
Yo, wassup with shop?

10:52.519 --> 10:53.987
No re-up.

10:54.087 --> 10:54.988
Why not?

10:55.088 --> 10:56.957
'Cause we out
of red caps.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.625
Stink say we have
a new package tomorrow.

10:58.726 --> 11:00.961
- New package?
- Yeah.

11:01.061 --> 11:03.764
Yeah, man,
this weak-ass stepped-on
shit we got out here

11:03.864 --> 11:05.632
get these
fiends agitated.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.567
Well, look at them,
they still buyin' it though.

11:07.667 --> 11:11.104
Yes, they buyin' twice as much
and only getting half as high.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.240
Yo, what was that?

11:13.340 --> 11:14.842
Hmm?

11:14.942 --> 11:16.309
Castle can't move
like that, yo.

11:16.409 --> 11:18.846
Castle move up and down
or sideways like.

11:18.946 --> 11:20.147
Naw, we ain't
playin' that.

11:20.247 --> 11:21.614
Man, look at the board,
we playing checkers.

11:21.715 --> 11:23.516
Checkers?

11:23.616 --> 11:25.018
Yeah, checkers.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.320
Yo, why y'all playing
checkers on a chess set?

11:27.420 --> 11:28.688
Yo, why you
give a shit?

11:28.789 --> 11:30.057
Man, we ain't
got no checkers.

11:30.157 --> 11:32.125
Yeah, but yo,
chess is a better game, yo.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.426
So?

11:33.526 --> 11:35.628
Naw, holdup, holdup.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.297
Y'all don't know how
to play chess, do you?

11:37.397 --> 11:38.832
So?

11:38.932 --> 11:40.600
So, nothin', man.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.269
Look, I'll teach y'all
if you want to learn.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.837
C'mon, man,
nah, c'mon.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.105
We're right in
the middle of a game.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.140
Calm down, chill out,
I want to see this.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.042
Look, y'all can't be
playin' no checkers
on no chessboard, yo.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.178
A'ight, a'ight,
all right, man.

11:51.278 --> 11:54.347
Now, look, check it,
it's simple, it's simple.

11:54.447 --> 11:56.316
See this?

11:56.416 --> 11:59.419
This the kingpin,
a'ight?

11:59.519 --> 12:00.921
And he the man.

12:01.021 --> 12:03.957
You get the other dude's
king, you got the game.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.425
But, he tryin'
to get your king, too,

12:05.525 --> 12:07.060
so, you gotta
protect it.

12:07.160 --> 12:10.030
Now the king,
he move one space

12:10.130 --> 12:12.599
any direction
he damn choose,
'cause he's the king.

12:12.699 --> 12:14.802
Like this, this,
this, a'ight?

12:14.902 --> 12:16.837
But he ain't
got no hustle,

12:16.937 --> 12:18.705
but the rest of these
motherfuckers on the team,

12:18.806 --> 12:20.240
they got his back.

12:20.340 --> 12:23.410
And they run so deep,
he really ain't gotta do shit.

12:23.510 --> 12:24.812
Like your uncle.

12:24.912 --> 12:26.479
Yeah, like my uncle.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.148
And you see this?

12:28.248 --> 12:31.251
This the queen,
she smart and she fierce.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.854
She move any way she want
as far as she want.

12:33.954 --> 12:36.857
And she is
the go-get-shit-done piece.

12:36.957 --> 12:39.927
Remind me
of Stringer.

12:40.994 --> 12:43.330
And this over here
is the castle,

12:43.430 --> 12:45.398
it's like the stash.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.669
It move like this
and like this.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.639
Dog, stash
don't move, man.

12:52.739 --> 12:55.876
C'mon, yo, think.
How many times we move
the stash house this week?

12:55.976 --> 12:58.345
A'ight? And every time
we move the stash

12:58.445 --> 13:00.881
we got to move
a little muscle with it,
right, to protect it?

13:00.981 --> 13:02.449
True, true,
you right.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.151
A'ight,

13:04.251 --> 13:06.653
what about them little
bald-headed bitches,
right there?

13:06.753 --> 13:08.956
These right here.

13:09.056 --> 13:11.992
These are the pawns.
They like the soldiers.

13:12.092 --> 13:14.928
They move like this,
one space forward only,

13:15.028 --> 13:16.696
'cept when they fight.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.131
Then it's like...

13:18.231 --> 13:19.833
or like this.

13:19.933 --> 13:21.568
And they like
the front lines.

13:21.668 --> 13:22.769
They be out
in the field.

13:22.870 --> 13:24.804
So, how do you get
to be the king?

13:24.905 --> 13:26.339
It ain't like that.

13:26.439 --> 13:29.877
See, the king
stay the king, a'ight?

13:29.977 --> 13:31.778
Everything stay
who he is,

13:31.879 --> 13:33.380
'cept for the pawns.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.082
Now if a pawn

13:35.182 --> 13:37.050
make it all the way down
to the other dude's side,

13:37.150 --> 13:39.519
he get
to be queen.

13:40.988 --> 13:43.390
And like I said,
the queen ain't no bitch.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.325
She got all the moves.

13:45.425 --> 13:48.528
A'ight, so, if I make it
to the other end,

13:48.628 --> 13:50.397
I win?

13:50.497 --> 13:54.201
If you catch
the other dude's king
and trap it,

13:54.301 --> 13:55.635
then you win.

13:55.735 --> 13:56.904
A'ight, but if
I make it to the end,

13:57.004 --> 13:59.739
I'm top dog.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.942
Naw, yo, it ain't
like that, look.

14:02.042 --> 14:05.012
The pawns, man,
in the game,

14:05.112 --> 14:07.680
they get capped quick.

14:07.780 --> 14:10.283
They be out
the game early.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.321
Unless they some
smart-ass pawns.

14:21.929 --> 14:23.030
Nagras.

14:23.130 --> 14:24.431
Can you fucking
believe this?

14:24.531 --> 14:26.333
This shit
is prehistoric.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.568
What else they got
down there in property?

14:28.668 --> 14:30.737
Eight-tracks?
Victrolas?

14:30.837 --> 14:32.705
Fucking department's
a joke.

14:32.805 --> 14:34.474
We got to get with
the feds somehow.

14:34.574 --> 14:37.710
They got lightweights,
wireless, micro-recorders.

14:37.810 --> 14:39.879
Yeah, DEA
got those.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.481
I wear this on a warm day
and they're gonna know.

14:41.581 --> 14:44.451
Even if they do a half-assed
search, I'm done.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.853
Nagras, Jesus.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.755
You can't send his ass
into the projects

14:48.855 --> 14:50.457
with this shit
taped to him.

14:50.557 --> 14:51.992
That ain't gonna play.

14:52.092 --> 14:54.094
I'm saying.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.562
McNulty and the girl,

14:55.662 --> 14:57.164
the lizard from narcotics,
they've got the file.

14:57.264 --> 14:59.032
Who are you
partnered with?

14:59.132 --> 15:01.401
McNulty, but he don't
have shit to do with me.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.971
And I don't want nothing
to do with him neither.

15:05.405 --> 15:09.209
Major, I'm a fifth wheel on
a car that's going nowhere.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.344
Bring me home.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.313
Soon enough.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.883
Look, you're my eyes and ears
in this mess, right?

15:16.984 --> 15:18.218
And I don't want
no more surprises

15:18.318 --> 15:19.919
like that
newspaper article.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.654
If McNulty's planning
anymore bullshit like that,

15:21.754 --> 15:26.259
I got to be able
to tell the deputy
before the shit flies.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.295
Then you come home with
a favor in your pocket.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.397
How bad is that?

15:43.643 --> 15:46.479
( jazz music playing )

16:01.761 --> 16:03.196
Lieutenant.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.632
You get Carver
and Prez back tomorrow,

16:05.732 --> 16:07.934
but Prez
is in-office.

16:08.035 --> 16:09.736
No police powers,
no street work, nothing.

16:09.836 --> 16:12.539
If the building catches fire,
he stays in the office.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.107
What about Herc?

16:14.207 --> 16:16.976
Medical 'til Monday,
at least.

16:20.847 --> 16:25.418
I wonder what you gotta
do to get thrown off
this police force.

16:25.518 --> 16:28.455
Keep on with
some of your shit,
you just might find out.

16:29.889 --> 16:31.691
Where are
the fucking run-sheets?

16:31.791 --> 16:34.061
Behind the board.

16:36.963 --> 16:38.598
You all go
for a taste?

16:38.698 --> 16:40.400
Hey.

16:40.500 --> 16:44.504
We got your picture,
don't you fucking
worry, McNulty.

16:51.944 --> 16:53.446
This is Barksdale?

16:53.546 --> 16:55.014
Avon Barksdale.

16:55.115 --> 16:57.484
I don't think so.

16:57.584 --> 17:00.453
Read my lips.
Avon fucking Barksdale.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.389
His name's on the form
in the file.

17:02.489 --> 17:04.357
Well, excuse me
for giving a shit,

17:04.457 --> 17:07.194
but I can't help
but notice this is
a middle-aged white man.

17:07.294 --> 17:10.829
Hey, you want
something different,
you give me another name.

17:10.930 --> 17:15.135
That's the only
Avon Barksdale in the
housing department files.

17:17.170 --> 17:18.637
You've got
your smokes?

17:18.738 --> 17:21.641
Have a nice
fucking day.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.147
Maybe he's white.

17:28.248 --> 17:30.650
( both laughing )

17:32.452 --> 17:35.455
No, I mean, really,
what do we really know?

17:35.555 --> 17:39.159
Avon Barksdale,
31 years of age,

17:39.259 --> 17:41.394
born Provident Hospital,
West Baltimore

17:41.494 --> 17:45.765
to Willette Jackson Barksdale,
father unknown.

17:45.865 --> 17:48.000
Educated
Baltimore City Schools.

17:48.101 --> 17:50.002
Early address is in
the same public housing

17:50.103 --> 17:51.738
where he now controls
the drug trade.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.273
No flash,
no profile,

17:53.373 --> 17:56.176
pretty much comes up
out of nowhere.

17:56.276 --> 17:57.844
No work history.

17:57.944 --> 17:59.579
No tax information
we can look at.

17:59.679 --> 18:02.014
No cars in his name,
no driver's license.

18:02.115 --> 18:04.184
No kids.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.052
No priors either.

18:06.153 --> 18:09.856
Oh, yeah, his vague
CI information that states

18:09.956 --> 18:12.292
he stays in
various apartments
out in the county,

18:12.392 --> 18:15.128
addresses undetermined,
of course.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.564
He moves from
girlfriend to girlfriend,

18:17.664 --> 18:19.932
might have another
girlfriend in New York,

18:20.032 --> 18:21.634
he likes to work out,

18:21.734 --> 18:25.172
and he used to box Golden
Gloves when he was younger.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.575
I've been working
on this guy for two weeks

18:28.675 --> 18:30.343
and the truth is
we don't know shit.

18:30.443 --> 18:34.581
Golden Gloves?
How'd you hear that?

18:34.681 --> 18:36.383
I don't know.

18:36.483 --> 18:40.520
I think I got that
from a DEA file.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.223
Uh, from a CI

18:43.323 --> 18:46.593
who claimed to know him
way back when.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.462
So, you write
everything down?

18:51.864 --> 18:54.467
Yeah, everything.

18:59.071 --> 19:01.308
Man:
I got that bomb, y'all.

19:01.408 --> 19:02.675
Blue tops, blue tops.

19:02.775 --> 19:06.646
Double shorts,
in the hole, man.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.782
Got blue tops,
lookin' for blues?

19:09.882 --> 19:11.050
Male:
In the hole, y'all.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.119
Blue tops,
red tops.

19:13.220 --> 19:15.955
Got that chronic...

19:16.055 --> 19:18.358
Red tops,
two for 10.

19:18.458 --> 19:21.794
Blue tops, blue tops.

19:45.385 --> 19:47.554
Keep your jab moving.

19:49.256 --> 19:50.457
Move with your right.

19:50.557 --> 19:53.760
Left, right, left, right,
two punches.

20:02.168 --> 20:03.870
I got a few questions
I wanna ask you, Mack.

20:03.970 --> 20:06.873
Keep your hands moving,
work to the body some, man.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.174
So, who's
your target?

20:08.275 --> 20:10.243
- Barksdale.
- Who?

20:10.343 --> 20:12.745
- Avon Barksdale.
- Never heard of him.

20:12.845 --> 20:14.347
That's the thing.

20:14.447 --> 20:16.148
This guy's got
the Westside Projects
locked up.

20:16.249 --> 20:17.517
He's tied to maybe
a dozen murders,

20:17.617 --> 20:19.018
he's completely
off the radar.

20:19.118 --> 20:20.219
Avon, what was it?

20:20.320 --> 20:22.722
- Barksdale.
- If you say so.

20:22.822 --> 20:25.124
DEA has a couple pages
on him from Naddis entries.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.794
Nothing in NCIC,
no adult arrests.

20:27.894 --> 20:30.530
I've been working drugs
for the bureau since '98

20:30.630 --> 20:34.100
and I can tell you we got
nothing on him that I know.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.135
This little thing

20:36.235 --> 20:38.638
is the smile
of the week.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.807
Watch this.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.742
( chattering )

20:42.842 --> 20:43.943
What was that?

20:44.043 --> 20:45.712
Get the door.
Get the door.

20:53.219 --> 20:54.454
Career case.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.523
Not that my bosses
give a damn at this point.

20:56.623 --> 20:57.957
Why not?

20:58.057 --> 20:59.492
Why not?

20:59.592 --> 21:00.927
All them mopes
in bracelets

21:01.027 --> 21:02.595
and not one of 'em
named Osama.

21:02.695 --> 21:05.565
Still, I owe you, brother,
what do you need?

21:05.665 --> 21:07.233
A couple of
lightweight body mikes.

21:07.334 --> 21:08.968
Wireless,
remote taping capability.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.503
That's all?

21:10.603 --> 21:12.672
Hey, where I come from,

21:12.772 --> 21:14.707
we're just happy
to be in the 20th century.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.576
All right,
who's running the case?

21:16.676 --> 21:18.177
So I can tell
my squad supervisor.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.713
Daniels,
out of narcotics.

21:22.949 --> 21:25.485
All right, no problem.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.657
Shit, fucking rain, man.

21:30.757 --> 21:32.825
All right, all right,
y'all know what the fuck
this is.

21:32.925 --> 21:34.527
Up against the wall,
hurry the fuck up.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.363
C'mon, let's go,
c'mon, let's go.

21:36.463 --> 21:37.697
Going to the back,
going to the back.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.499
Ain't got time
for this shit.

21:41.601 --> 21:43.002
Got some red-tops,
some testers.

21:43.102 --> 21:44.504
Get 'em around
the corner.

21:44.604 --> 21:45.838
Hurry up, take 'em around,
take 'em around.

21:45.938 --> 21:48.741
Shit, man, what the fuck
you lookin' at me for?

21:48.841 --> 21:50.843
Get your ass
around the corner.

22:00.787 --> 22:04.023
I want that shit,
that's good.

22:04.123 --> 22:07.494
Keep it movin',
keep it movin'.

22:23.075 --> 22:24.310
Yeah, you see that?

22:24.411 --> 22:25.612
Aw, yeah.

22:25.712 --> 22:28.515
Third from the end,
that's the stash.

22:28.615 --> 22:31.117
Some real raggedy-ass
shit here, boy.

22:31.217 --> 22:33.052
Very sloppy.

22:33.152 --> 22:34.887
Hmm.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.260
How old
are your kids?

22:41.360 --> 22:43.996
Mike is eight,
Sean's 10.

22:44.096 --> 22:46.332
That's the hard part.

22:46.433 --> 22:48.568
Yeah, that's the hard part,
but, you know.

22:48.668 --> 22:50.937
So, how often do you
get to see them?

22:51.037 --> 22:52.304
Every other weekend.

22:52.405 --> 22:54.441
Trying to get more,
but she's fighting me.

22:54.541 --> 22:55.908
Why would she fight
you on that?

22:56.008 --> 22:57.944
She's getting even.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.245
Getting even?

22:59.345 --> 23:01.414
You must've been
fuckin' around.

23:01.514 --> 23:02.749
I'm just sayin'.

23:02.849 --> 23:04.851
- You're right.
- It's always the case.

23:04.951 --> 23:06.519
When a woman
lookin' to get even,

23:06.619 --> 23:07.987
there's gotta be a little
extra something there.

23:08.087 --> 23:09.556
Hey, Bubs, how come
you got all this wisdom

23:09.656 --> 23:11.323
and your life's
so fucking hard?

23:11.424 --> 23:13.960
I been wondering
on that myself.

23:15.327 --> 23:17.096
So, how about you?

23:17.196 --> 23:19.499
You ever been married?

23:22.602 --> 23:24.203
What'd I say?

23:24.303 --> 23:26.072
You ain't gonna
say anything, I am.

23:26.172 --> 23:27.507
What?

23:27.607 --> 23:29.676
If you a dog, you barkin'
at the wrong pussy.

23:29.776 --> 23:31.277
What, so,
I'm a dog now?

23:31.377 --> 23:32.945
Meow.

23:33.045 --> 23:34.947
Yo, Bubs.

23:35.047 --> 23:36.883
I date women.

23:36.983 --> 23:39.085
There we are, we've got
something else in common,
I date women, too.

23:39.185 --> 23:42.188
So, pretty much
everyone in CID's
worked this out but me?

23:42.288 --> 23:44.524
Well, shit, wasn't
nothing to figure out,
I told 'em.

23:44.624 --> 23:46.493
I guess I missed
the press conference.

23:46.593 --> 23:48.661
Look, it's better that
than to have every police

23:48.761 --> 23:51.531
on three shifts houndin'
you every goddamn day.

23:51.631 --> 23:54.066
Cops are dogs.

23:54.166 --> 23:55.635
Yeah.

23:55.735 --> 23:57.336
It's not like I was,
you know, walkin' around,

23:57.436 --> 24:00.507
wavin' some dyke flag
in the air or some shit.

24:01.674 --> 24:03.876
Hey, I know I look like
I could go either way.

24:03.976 --> 24:06.479
Ooh, Lord, yes, you do.
Yes, you do.

24:06.579 --> 24:09.448
It was just somethin'
I had to put out there
to get through the day.

24:09.549 --> 24:12.084
- I should've known.
- Should've known what?

24:12.184 --> 24:14.854
I worked with one
other female police officer

24:14.954 --> 24:17.023
who was worth a damn,
only one.

24:17.123 --> 24:19.058
- A lesbian.
- Yeah.

24:24.463 --> 24:27.133
In the beginning,
you're in your radio car,

24:27.233 --> 24:29.869
alone,
working your post.

24:29.969 --> 24:31.804
Most women aren't
getting out of that car.

24:31.904 --> 24:32.905
Right.

24:33.005 --> 24:34.941
Not without side partners
showin' up.

24:35.041 --> 24:37.043
They're intimidated.

24:37.143 --> 24:38.310
Physically.

24:38.410 --> 24:39.512
They gotta be.

24:39.612 --> 24:40.913
You weren't?

24:41.013 --> 24:42.549
Yeah, at first.

24:42.649 --> 24:44.851
But, you know,
talkin' about some old,

24:44.951 --> 24:47.086
you know, straight-out-of-
the-academy-type scared,

24:47.186 --> 24:48.287
you know
what I'm sayin'?

24:48.387 --> 24:49.789
I wasn't about
to stay scared.

24:49.889 --> 24:52.559
You know, you get
your ass kicked,

24:52.659 --> 24:53.926
you know,
once or twice,

24:54.026 --> 24:55.928
you realize it's not
the end of the world, right?

24:56.028 --> 24:57.564
Mm-hmm.

24:57.664 --> 25:00.132
Most of the women,
they don't want to
believe that.

25:00.232 --> 25:02.735
Some of the men, too.
They don't even
want to go there.

25:02.835 --> 25:05.437
- You think
'cause you're gay?
- I don't know.

25:05.538 --> 25:08.708
But is there any other
fuckin' way to police?

25:10.810 --> 25:13.680
All I know is
I just love the job.

25:17.483 --> 25:18.951
That'll be $3.20.

25:19.051 --> 25:20.486
Keep the change.

25:20.587 --> 25:23.089
Thanks,
have a nice day.

25:31.864 --> 25:34.701
* Baby say, yeah,
baby say, yeah *

25:34.801 --> 25:37.737

25:37.837 --> 25:39.906
* Baby say, yeah,

25:42.809 --> 25:45.177

25:45.277 --> 25:48.781
* Girl, I would be,

25:48.881 --> 25:50.950
* I know that you're lovin' me
'cause you thug with me *

25:51.050 --> 25:53.786
* You're a slug to me,
my baby *

25:53.886 --> 25:56.522
* You goin' feel for you
like I comfort you *

25:56.623 --> 25:59.391
* The world's bugged
but you feel me *

25:59.491 --> 26:01.160
* Girl, we'll connect
the dots *

26:01.260 --> 26:03.562
* We'll hit the spot,
between me *

26:03.663 --> 26:06.132
* You ride hard,
I ride drop... *

26:06.232 --> 26:09.602
Hey, yo,
Dee comin' up.

26:28.287 --> 26:30.189
Where's it all go?

26:30.289 --> 26:31.991
Huh?

26:32.091 --> 26:34.160
The money.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.929
Where all
the money go?

26:46.739 --> 26:48.741
22, four,
give or take.

26:48.841 --> 26:50.509
From the low-rises?

26:50.609 --> 26:53.145
( laughing )

26:53.245 --> 26:56.548
Damn, boy, you must
have that crew hummin'.

26:56.649 --> 27:00.853
I don't remember a day
we ever got this much
from the courtyard.

27:00.953 --> 27:02.822
It wasn't
even check day.

27:02.922 --> 27:04.490
You doin' good
out there, Dee.

27:04.590 --> 27:08.728
We'll be doin' even better
when we get that new package.

27:08.828 --> 27:11.731
New package
same as old, man.

27:11.831 --> 27:14.500
- Say what?
- Ain't no new package.

27:14.600 --> 27:15.802
Just gonna put
that same shit

27:15.902 --> 27:17.704
out in a different
color gelcap is all.

27:17.804 --> 27:19.638
Might spike that shit
with some procaine

27:19.739 --> 27:22.141
or some caffeine,
but otherwise the same.

27:22.241 --> 27:24.410
String, man, people are
already coming back on us,

27:24.510 --> 27:26.245
tellin' us
that shit is weak.

27:26.345 --> 27:28.681
I know, the shit is weak.
But, you know, shit is
weak all over.

27:28.781 --> 27:32.318
The thing is, no matter
what we call heroin,

27:32.418 --> 27:33.753
it's gonna get sold.

27:33.853 --> 27:35.654
The shit is strong,
we gonna sell it.

27:35.755 --> 27:37.690
The shit is weak,
we gonna sell twice as much.

27:37.790 --> 27:39.391
You know why?

27:39.491 --> 27:42.762
'Cause a fiend, he gonna chase
that shit no matter what.

27:42.862 --> 27:44.831
It's crazy,
you know?

27:44.931 --> 27:49.635
We do worse,
and we get paid more.

27:49.736 --> 27:51.570
The government do better

27:51.670 --> 27:54.306
and it don't
mean no nevermind.

27:54.406 --> 27:56.475
This shit right here,
Dee...

27:56.575 --> 27:58.711
is forever.

28:07.019 --> 28:08.721
That's your bonus
right there.

28:08.821 --> 28:12.859
And you make sure
you buy something that
you wouldn't otherwise.

28:14.460 --> 28:16.462
Thanks, man.

28:22.634 --> 28:24.103
All right.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.318
Hey.

28:39.418 --> 28:41.653
Hey.

28:41.754 --> 28:44.323
You remember me?

28:44.423 --> 28:47.693
Do I remember you?

28:47.794 --> 28:49.862
I was in here the other day,
you wanted a drink.

28:50.997 --> 28:52.298
Did I get a drink?

28:52.398 --> 28:54.834
Afraid not.

28:54.934 --> 28:56.836
Then why would
I remember you?

28:56.936 --> 28:58.137
You want
to be remembered,

28:58.237 --> 28:59.638
you going about it
the wrong way here.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.974
All right.

29:06.278 --> 29:08.114
Lerry.

29:10.149 --> 29:11.517
The usual.

29:11.617 --> 29:13.319
This here's
my uncle's place.

29:13.419 --> 29:15.587
You kin to Orlando?

29:15.687 --> 29:17.089
Naw.

29:19.358 --> 29:21.493
Orlando's like
the up-front man, you know?

29:21.593 --> 29:24.230
My uncle's
the money man.

29:30.302 --> 29:31.437
Where you from?

29:31.537 --> 29:32.638
Right here.

29:32.738 --> 29:34.206
Baltimore.

29:34.306 --> 29:36.943
I know Baltimore,
but, like, where?

29:37.043 --> 29:39.378
You know
Turner Station?

29:41.113 --> 29:43.615
Down past Dundalk
near the Point.

29:43.715 --> 29:45.451
Oh, the Point.

29:45.551 --> 29:47.319
So, you a country girl.

29:47.419 --> 29:49.421
You mean county.

29:49.521 --> 29:52.191
Where I'm from,
the county is the country.

29:52.291 --> 29:53.860
Where was that?

29:58.764 --> 30:00.332
So...

30:01.600 --> 30:04.770
are you workin'
with your uncle?

30:04.871 --> 30:07.106
I'm his right hand.

30:17.749 --> 30:20.352
Yes, you is.

30:24.623 --> 30:26.092
You want to ride
with us in the van?

30:26.192 --> 30:28.160
No.

30:28.260 --> 30:29.795
Why not?

30:29.896 --> 30:32.131
You think
it's a waste?

30:32.231 --> 30:35.367
Touts and children,
that's all you're gonna get.

30:42.308 --> 30:44.476
Bingo.

30:47.846 --> 30:50.983
Where did you
get this?

31:01.793 --> 31:03.963
( laughing )

31:04.063 --> 31:05.898
Now, look at
this piece of shit.

31:05.998 --> 31:09.101
I'm good to go,
right?

31:10.469 --> 31:12.571
Come here, let me see.

31:12.671 --> 31:14.907
Detective Sydnor's
ensemble

31:15.007 --> 31:17.843
is the latest
in Westside Project wear.

31:17.944 --> 31:20.913
Have your torn cammies
by Versace,

31:21.013 --> 31:24.984
stained sweatshirt
by Ralph Lauren.

31:25.084 --> 31:27.486
- Where you miked?
- Down in my dip, man.

31:27.586 --> 31:29.121
I figure they ain't gonna
go down there anyway, right?

31:29.221 --> 31:32.324
I don't know, Sydnor,
the way you twirlin' around,

31:32.424 --> 31:34.360
might be the first place
they look.

31:34.460 --> 31:36.628
Fuck you.

31:36.728 --> 31:40.199
I ain't showered in two days,
I ain't shaved in four.

31:40.299 --> 31:42.834
Right now,
I am one ripe,

31:42.935 --> 31:44.703
nasty son of a bitch.

31:44.803 --> 31:47.873
Yo, Bubs.

31:47.974 --> 31:49.375
What you think?

31:50.709 --> 31:53.145
This your man, huh?

31:53.245 --> 31:54.780
Yeah.

31:54.880 --> 31:57.383
Is he low-bottom
enough for you?

31:58.650 --> 32:00.552
Clothes is tore
down enough,

32:00.652 --> 32:02.955
but he could
use a little bit
more stains,

32:03.055 --> 32:05.924
more dirt.

32:06.025 --> 32:07.893
What's this here, man?

32:07.994 --> 32:10.929
It's my
wedding ring.

32:12.864 --> 32:14.266
Shit, you married
to the needle, boy.

32:14.366 --> 32:17.503
That shit been pawned off,
if you for real.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.871
Dead giveaway.

32:19.972 --> 32:22.041
You could stand
to lose about 20 pounds,

32:22.141 --> 32:23.909
some yellow
in your teeth,

32:24.010 --> 32:25.877
fresh bleeds
on the hands.

32:25.978 --> 32:27.513
Okay, so maybe
I should go out

32:27.613 --> 32:29.581
and shoot up some dope for
about a year or two, right?

32:29.681 --> 32:31.750
Come back when I can
really carry the look off?

32:31.850 --> 32:33.885
I'm jus' sayin',
I'm jus' sayin', man.

32:33.986 --> 32:36.688
The more tore down
you look, the better.

32:38.024 --> 32:39.925
You gonna go down
in them towers, man,

32:40.026 --> 32:41.127
they gonna
check everything.

32:41.227 --> 32:42.461
Yo, how 'bout
the shoes?

32:42.561 --> 32:44.763
I know you ain't got
no problem with the shoes,

32:44.863 --> 32:46.232
fucked up
as they are.

32:46.332 --> 32:48.400
Let me see
the shoes, man.

32:51.703 --> 32:53.039
See?

32:53.139 --> 32:54.373
You walkin' down them
alleys of the projects,

32:54.473 --> 32:56.075
man, you steppin'
on the dead soldiers.

32:56.175 --> 32:58.677
Dead soldiers?

32:58.777 --> 33:00.312
Yeah, empty vials.

33:00.412 --> 33:02.081
You can't walk down
a Baltimore street

33:02.181 --> 33:03.949
without that shit crackin'
underneath your feet.

33:04.050 --> 33:06.685
You want to know
if a fiend for real?

33:06.785 --> 33:09.221
Check the bottom
of his shoes.

33:10.789 --> 33:12.191
Okay.

33:12.291 --> 33:14.826
Have him dance
on some empties
before we go out there.

33:14.926 --> 33:18.130
Get us killed.

33:19.765 --> 33:21.900
He hurt your feelings?

33:22.000 --> 33:23.602
Little bit.

33:28.040 --> 33:30.642
Shit.

33:30.742 --> 33:32.244
* Hit it

33:42.088 --> 33:44.356
* It takes two to make
a thing go right *

33:45.724 --> 33:48.427
* It takes two to make it
outta sight *

33:50.096 --> 33:52.364
* It takes two to make
a thing go right *

33:54.366 --> 33:56.702
* It takes two to
make it outta sight *

33:59.305 --> 34:00.939
* I wanna rock
right now *

34:01.039 --> 34:02.474
* I'm Rob Base
and I came to get down *

34:02.574 --> 34:04.376
* I'm not
internationally known *

34:04.476 --> 34:06.412
* But I'm known
to rock the microphone *

34:06.512 --> 34:08.614
* Because I get stupid,
I mean outrageous *

34:08.714 --> 34:11.150
* Stay away from me,
if you're contagious *

34:11.250 --> 34:13.051
* 'Cause I'm the man,
no, I'm not a loser *

34:13.152 --> 34:15.454
* To be an MC
is what I choose to *

34:15.554 --> 34:17.456
* Ladies love me,
girls adore me *

34:17.556 --> 34:20.025
* I mean even the ones
who never saw me *

34:20.126 --> 34:21.726
* Like the way that I rhyme
and have soul *

34:21.827 --> 34:23.962
* The reason why, man,
I don't know *

34:24.062 --> 34:25.397
* So, let's go 'cause

34:27.166 --> 34:29.534
* it takes two to make
a thing go right *

34:31.103 --> 34:33.405
* It takes two to
make it outta sight *

34:35.206 --> 34:38.210
* It takes two to make
a thing go right... *

34:59.998 --> 35:01.099
Four hand-to-hands.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.135
Two to me,
two to Bubs,

35:03.235 --> 35:05.070
with me close enough
to mark it.

35:05.171 --> 35:06.838
From who?

35:06.938 --> 35:09.541
Kids, mostly.
Young-ass hoppers.

35:09.641 --> 35:12.077
It's a start.

35:12.178 --> 35:13.645
They pretty tight
out here, Kima.

35:13.745 --> 35:15.881
You don't hand no money
to nobody that matters,

35:15.981 --> 35:19.218
you don't get no product
from nobody that matters.

35:22.188 --> 35:24.055
You want
to go back in?

35:24.156 --> 35:27.659
Shit, we copped
from every crew out here.

35:29.195 --> 35:31.062
Ain't we supposed
to go off somewhere

35:31.163 --> 35:32.598
and fire this shit up?

35:35.033 --> 35:37.736
Yeah, let's get
the fuck out of here.

35:39.171 --> 35:40.806
( ignition starting )

35:51.717 --> 35:53.652
Well, now.

35:56.622 --> 35:59.658
Did you get to see
where the money went
after you handed off?

36:01.092 --> 36:02.428
No.

36:04.630 --> 36:07.966
Nothing but touts
and runners here.

36:08.066 --> 36:11.002
But then again,
you told us so.

36:11.102 --> 36:13.104
I didn't say that.

36:13.205 --> 36:16.174
But as a matter
of fact.

36:17.108 --> 36:19.345
( door opening )

36:26.952 --> 36:28.520
Everyone else
roll out?

36:28.620 --> 36:29.788
I--

36:29.888 --> 36:32.458
you were, uh, upstairs
and out of pocket,

36:32.558 --> 36:35.261
so, uh,
I cut 'em loose.

36:35.361 --> 36:37.028
Just as well.

36:37.128 --> 36:38.664
I'll give 'em
the news tomorrow.

36:38.764 --> 36:40.131
What happened?

36:40.232 --> 36:41.767
I told the deputy
we had a few hand-to-hands.

36:41.867 --> 36:43.502
Low-level people.

36:43.602 --> 36:45.971
He wants us
to put everything we get
into search-and-seizures

36:46.071 --> 36:47.806
and hit the projects
Wednesday afternoon.

36:47.906 --> 36:49.441
- Lieutenant.
- I know.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.843
Does he think
that's what gets us
Avon Barksdale?

36:51.943 --> 36:55.213
The buys we made,
they don't even go
past the courtyards.

36:55.314 --> 36:59.251
I need you to scratch
together everything we got
from the hand-to-hands

36:59.351 --> 37:02.053
and shape it into PC
for the warrants.

37:02.153 --> 37:04.323
A few locations
at least.

37:04.423 --> 37:06.458
But we don't even know
what doors to hit.

37:06.558 --> 37:09.127
A few apartments
in the low-rises

37:09.227 --> 37:11.330
that we've seen
used for stash, maybe.

37:11.430 --> 37:12.998
Then we write
on those.

37:13.098 --> 37:15.601
Lieutenant, these guys change
stash houses every other day.

37:15.701 --> 37:18.470
Look, the man upstairs
wants to see a circus.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.906
A couple of days from now,
I got to show him three rings.

37:21.006 --> 37:22.974
Christ.

37:25.010 --> 37:26.612
I'm sorry.

37:26.712 --> 37:28.847
We gotta jump.

37:40.526 --> 37:42.628
Is the deputy
ops stupid?

37:42.728 --> 37:43.695
No.

37:43.795 --> 37:45.764
Well, this shit
is fucking stupid.

37:45.864 --> 37:47.933
No, we bring in some arrests,
he takes them to the judge.

37:48.033 --> 37:49.267
He figures
the judge goes away.

37:49.368 --> 37:52.604
And then he buries
the fucking case.

37:57.242 --> 37:58.377
What are we gonna do?

37:58.477 --> 37:59.578
There's nothing
you can do,

37:59.678 --> 38:01.079
except pound out
some probable cause.

38:01.179 --> 38:02.914
We're gonna be here
all fucking night.

38:03.014 --> 38:04.983
Well, I'm not.

38:05.083 --> 38:06.184
Where the fuck
you got to go?

38:06.284 --> 38:07.486
No, I mean,
I can't.

38:07.586 --> 38:08.987
I'm not gonna help them
gut the case.

38:09.087 --> 38:10.188
I'm sorry.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.390
I know
he's your lieutenant.

38:11.490 --> 38:12.758
You gotta do
what you gotta do.

38:12.858 --> 38:14.893
But I can't swallow
this shit anymore.

38:19.631 --> 38:24.169
* Mr. Johnson sings
on a corner by the bar *

38:24.269 --> 38:26.137
* Sold his soul
to the devil *

38:26.237 --> 38:29.375
* So he can
play guitar *

38:31.309 --> 38:33.845
* Too cool
to be forgotten *

38:33.945 --> 38:35.814
* Hey, hey...

38:35.914 --> 38:38.049
( knocking )

38:49.327 --> 38:51.630
Why are you here?

38:51.730 --> 38:53.298
Been thinking
about something.

38:53.399 --> 38:56.635
- Can I come in?
- No.

38:56.735 --> 38:57.636
No?

38:57.736 --> 38:59.337
What's the matter,
McNulty?

38:59.438 --> 39:01.006
No one ever
tells you no?

39:01.106 --> 39:03.475
Sorry.
I should've called.

39:06.745 --> 39:08.547
How do you
clone a beeper?

39:08.647 --> 39:10.582
- What?
- That's what I need to know.

39:10.682 --> 39:14.586
You show up at my door
at 9:00 to ask me that?

39:14.686 --> 39:16.187
They're using
pagers, right?

39:16.287 --> 39:17.589
Every other drug dealer
has a cell phone

39:17.689 --> 39:19.591
and these guys
are all on pagers.

39:23.629 --> 39:25.096
What do you
want to do?

39:25.196 --> 39:28.600
Bunk and me,
when we jack up
the Barksdale kid,

39:28.700 --> 39:30.502
he's got
a Motorola pager.

39:30.602 --> 39:33.071
We give it back
so not to spook him.

39:33.171 --> 39:34.773
You want
to clone it?

39:34.873 --> 39:37.776
Can we do that with a subpoena
to the pager company?

39:43.482 --> 39:44.916
Read that.

39:45.016 --> 39:46.317
What is it?

39:46.418 --> 39:48.286
Affidavit from
a state police case.

39:48.386 --> 39:51.890
A judge signs
something like that,
you can clone a beeper.

39:51.990 --> 39:53.358
Christ.

39:53.459 --> 39:55.160
Probable cause, coupled with
an exhaustion argument.

39:55.260 --> 39:56.962
You got to
show the judge

39:57.062 --> 39:59.197
that other investigative
methods have failed.

39:59.297 --> 40:01.900
You'll also
need a supervisor

40:02.000 --> 40:04.002
who wants you to clone
a suspect's pager,

40:04.102 --> 40:07.105
knowing that it might
lead to who knows what else,

40:07.205 --> 40:09.107
pen registers, wiretaps.

40:09.207 --> 40:10.909
Daniels'll come around.

40:11.009 --> 40:12.343
( laughing )

40:12.444 --> 40:15.547
Daniels will
have your ass.

40:17.849 --> 40:18.950
Thanks.

40:19.050 --> 40:21.520
- That's it?
- What?

40:22.988 --> 40:24.723
No.

40:40.138 --> 40:41.940
Let me understand.

40:42.040 --> 40:44.676
You're married
and a date is a room

40:44.776 --> 40:46.545
at the Best Western
with the blinds closed.

40:46.645 --> 40:48.413
Now you're single
and a date is

40:48.514 --> 40:49.981
you coming over
unannounced

40:50.081 --> 40:53.785
to learn the legal requisites
for a pager intercept.

40:53.885 --> 40:55.954
Pretty much.

40:57.322 --> 40:58.690
No.

41:01.493 --> 41:03.662
Okay, I hear you.

41:04.530 --> 41:07.533
( moaning )

41:39.064 --> 41:40.966
You?

41:43.535 --> 41:46.805
As if you
give a shit.

42:06.592 --> 42:09.728
You're an asshole,
McNulty.

42:11.863 --> 42:14.065
What the fuck
did I do?

42:17.535 --> 42:19.204
Yo, how much more
to that pack?

42:19.304 --> 42:21.272
50, 60.

42:21.372 --> 42:24.876
Re-up's late.

42:26.712 --> 42:28.980
Have Wallace hit Stinkum
on his pager again.

42:29.080 --> 42:31.249
You want something
from carry-out?

42:31.349 --> 42:33.819
Yeah,
lake trout sub.

42:33.919 --> 42:35.821
Pay up.

42:35.921 --> 42:39.357
Damn. You asked,
I thought you was treatin'.

42:39.457 --> 42:42.027
Well, you thought wrong,
I ain't no bank.

42:42.127 --> 42:43.795
You stingy like one.

42:43.895 --> 42:46.564
Just make sure
you give me enough.

42:47.799 --> 42:50.568
No mayo, extra hot,
somethin' to drink.

42:50.669 --> 42:52.804
All right.

42:57.408 --> 42:59.911
- Yo, he go for food?
- Yep.

43:00.011 --> 43:02.547
Why ain't you tell me?
My stomach growlin'
like a motherfuck.

43:02.648 --> 43:03.982
Starve, nigga.

43:04.082 --> 43:05.483
Man, shit.

43:05.583 --> 43:07.218
Yo, re-up's here.

43:07.318 --> 43:09.154
Stink, what up?

43:09.254 --> 43:11.389
What's up, bro?

43:11.489 --> 43:13.058
10 minutes, yo.

43:13.158 --> 43:14.259
- 10?
- Yeah.

43:14.359 --> 43:15.927
A'ight.

43:25.136 --> 43:26.304
Who there?

43:40.018 --> 43:41.953
Y'all got my back,
you heard me?

43:42.821 --> 43:44.690
Get the fuck
in here.

43:45.556 --> 43:46.825
Get your ass down.

43:46.925 --> 43:49.160
Sit your
stupid ass down.

43:49.260 --> 43:50.495
Get the fuck down.

43:50.595 --> 43:52.263
Shit, stay there, bitch.

43:52.363 --> 43:53.832
Yo, yo, get down,
get down.

43:53.932 --> 43:56.601
Get the fuck down,
motherfucker.

43:56.702 --> 43:58.136
Hey, yo,
where it at?

43:58.236 --> 44:00.071
Ain't none here, yo.

44:00.171 --> 44:02.774
Where it at, man?

44:05.777 --> 44:08.747
Aw, shit!

44:08.847 --> 44:11.416
Oh, fuck,
my leg !

44:11.516 --> 44:13.752
Where it at,
shorty?

44:17.388 --> 44:20.458
Kitchen,
under the sink.

44:20.558 --> 44:22.560
Hey, yo,
go on and get that.

44:22.660 --> 44:25.263
( groaning )

44:37.542 --> 44:39.978
Two G-packs.
Let's roll.

44:40.078 --> 44:41.847
Just two?

44:41.947 --> 44:44.950
- Yo, Omar, c'mon.
- Yo, what the fu--

44:46.417 --> 44:48.854
stupid.

44:54.259 --> 44:56.928
( groaning )

45:01.132 --> 45:02.968
Aw, shit !

45:03.068 --> 45:06.171
Let's get
the fuck out of here.

45:08.740 --> 45:10.441
Aw, shit!

45:10.541 --> 45:12.377
( door slams )

45:14.712 --> 45:16.447
( car driving away )

45:16.547 --> 45:19.117
C'mon, Poot.

45:19.217 --> 45:21.887
Fuck!

45:27.859 --> 45:31.296
( dog barking )

45:46.812 --> 45:48.646
So, your man
saw 'em get jacked?

45:48.746 --> 45:49.848
Yeah, part of it.

45:49.948 --> 45:52.317
And he gets
the tag number?

45:52.417 --> 45:54.152
Good man,
that Bubbles.

45:55.821 --> 45:57.522
Listen up.

45:59.490 --> 46:01.927
Western uniforms will
meet us in the Mount Clare
parking lot.

46:02.027 --> 46:04.863
We start there
and we don't stop
'til we take the doors.

46:04.963 --> 46:08.066
I want their lookouts
to have as little chance
as possible.

46:08.934 --> 46:10.368
What's with you?

46:14.840 --> 46:16.407
My office.

46:28.987 --> 46:31.556
- I'm not going.
- You're insubordinate?

46:31.656 --> 46:34.292
I'm not jumping out
on something I believe's
gonna harm the case.

46:34.392 --> 46:35.961
You want to write me up
on that, you can.

46:36.061 --> 46:37.328
You think I want this?

46:37.428 --> 46:39.764
I got the deputy ops
on my ass for this shit.

46:39.865 --> 46:42.633
Now I got you
showing me up in front of
the whole damn detail.

46:42.733 --> 46:44.002
I don't mean
to show anybody up.

46:44.102 --> 46:46.037
- Get your vest on.
- No.

46:46.137 --> 46:47.772
I got police work to do.

46:47.873 --> 46:50.608
Motherfucker,
if you felt this way,

46:50.708 --> 46:51.809
why didn't you
call in sick?

46:51.910 --> 46:55.280
- I'm not sick.
- Yeah, you are.

47:01.219 --> 47:03.354
Gimme a 95 on why
you are physically unable

47:03.454 --> 47:05.456
to participate in
today's police action.

47:05.556 --> 47:07.258
What, I'm gonna lie
so you can save face?

47:07.358 --> 47:09.327
Come on, write it up.

47:09.427 --> 47:10.962
I can't jump out
with the rest of my unit

47:11.062 --> 47:12.230
because my tummy hurts.

47:12.330 --> 47:13.798
I'm not gonna help you
gut this case.

47:13.899 --> 47:15.500
If you want to pretend
to be a police,

47:15.600 --> 47:17.235
you go ahead.

47:36.821 --> 47:38.589
Let's do it.

47:41.927 --> 47:43.394
I'm up.

47:43.494 --> 47:45.463
You're on medical.

47:45.563 --> 47:47.465
I'm up, boss.

47:48.633 --> 47:50.035
Give him a vest.

48:03.581 --> 48:05.216
Naw, motherfucker.

48:05.316 --> 48:06.918
It ain't just up
to Stinkum to be muscle.

48:07.018 --> 48:08.553
You got the pit.

48:08.653 --> 48:10.956
Your people supposed
to be ready for the re-up.

48:11.056 --> 48:13.824
You supposed to be
steady for him.

48:13.925 --> 48:15.326
But where you at?

48:15.426 --> 48:17.595
You in the goddamn
sammich shop.

48:17.695 --> 48:19.764
You got 20 thousand
dollar, Dee,

48:19.864 --> 48:21.266
coming into your shop

48:21.366 --> 48:23.601
and you ain't even around
to see that shit right.

48:23.701 --> 48:25.270
Look, I thought re-ups--

48:25.370 --> 48:27.038
No, thinkin' was
what you wasn't doin'

48:27.138 --> 48:28.873
and now we look
like bitches.

48:28.974 --> 48:30.208
You feel me?

48:30.308 --> 48:32.277
We got to
come back on 'em

48:32.377 --> 48:34.712
and you can't even tell
me shit about who they was.

48:34.812 --> 48:37.348
One of 'em
was named Omar.

48:38.416 --> 48:39.317
Omar?

48:39.417 --> 48:41.752
Yeah, Omar,
that's the name I heard.

48:41.852 --> 48:43.989
And they had
a white van.

48:44.089 --> 48:45.923
Yeah, I saw
the van down there.

48:46.024 --> 48:47.358
What kind of van?

48:47.458 --> 48:49.627
Man:
Five-oh!

49:06.611 --> 49:08.013
- Wrong door.
- Yeah?

49:08.113 --> 49:10.415
Yeah, switched it
yesterday.

49:11.616 --> 49:13.418
Let's see your hands.
Let's see your hands.

49:13.518 --> 49:15.186
Get the fuck out the way.
Let's see your hands.

49:15.286 --> 49:17.255
Up, motherfucker, up.

49:17.355 --> 49:19.190
Turn around.

49:20.525 --> 49:22.360
All the way up.

49:29.734 --> 49:31.136
Man:
Police.

49:31.236 --> 49:33.104
Put your hands up,
put 'em up!

49:33.204 --> 49:35.706
Turn your
monkey ass around.

49:37.075 --> 49:38.509
Why you fucking
with us, man?

49:38.609 --> 49:41.379
C'mon, man, damn,
we wasn't even doin' shit.

49:44.482 --> 49:46.117
C'mon, man.

49:49.920 --> 49:52.823
C'mon, motherfucker,
how that feel?

49:52.923 --> 49:54.325
How that feel?
You fucked up now.

49:54.425 --> 49:56.761
You fucked up.
You feel it, right?

49:59.164 --> 50:01.366
I'm gonna swing it.
I'm gonna swing it.

50:01.466 --> 50:04.135
You hit a cop,
Motherfucker.

50:04.235 --> 50:06.637
Go ahead, play that
cowboy shit, motherfucker.

50:06.737 --> 50:09.307
Go ahead, hold 'em down.
Hold him down.

50:09.407 --> 50:11.676
Hold his arms.
Hold his arms!

50:11.776 --> 50:13.444
Up against
the fucking wall.
Spread your legs.

50:13.544 --> 50:14.845
Don't make me
kick your ass, too.

50:14.945 --> 50:16.714
Motherfucker, come on.

50:16.814 --> 50:18.616
Get him,
get him.

50:18.716 --> 50:19.950
Gonna hit a cop.

50:20.051 --> 50:21.186
What's wrong
with you, boy?

50:21.286 --> 50:22.620
You wanna
hit a cop.

50:23.721 --> 50:26.424
( music playing )

50:58.856 --> 50:59.957
Clean.

51:00.057 --> 51:01.326
Not a fucking thing
in there.

51:01.426 --> 51:02.860
Pick any door
in the low-rises.

51:02.960 --> 51:04.562
What are the chances?

51:22.280 --> 51:24.449
Channel two wants to know
if she can take her cameras

51:24.549 --> 51:26.217
through some of
the places we raided.

51:26.317 --> 51:29.520
She says
whatever we got,
she'll put on film.

51:29.620 --> 51:31.122
Whatever we got?

51:31.222 --> 51:33.791
Drugs, weapons.

51:33.891 --> 51:35.426
We ain't got shit.

51:39.797 --> 51:42.733
( car radio playing )

51:58.549 --> 52:00.551
I can tell you
were never in patrol.

52:00.651 --> 52:03.488
Right, right.

52:14.165 --> 52:16.467
- Sorry, I'm late.
- What's up?

52:16.567 --> 52:19.069
I didn't want to tell you
in front of the girl.

52:19.170 --> 52:21.606
Her being from
narcotics and all.

52:21.706 --> 52:24.709
Daniels is dirty.

52:24.809 --> 52:26.110
What?

52:26.211 --> 52:27.345
The guy
running your case.

52:27.445 --> 52:28.946
He's got dirt on him.

52:29.046 --> 52:30.515
You know this?

52:30.615 --> 52:33.117
Your own agency came to us with
concerns about him last year.

52:33.218 --> 52:35.152
Integrity questions.

52:35.253 --> 52:37.222
They didn't want to take it
to Internal Affairs,

52:37.322 --> 52:39.457
because that office
leaks like a sieve.

52:39.557 --> 52:41.158
Plus the fact
they couldn't handle a case

52:41.259 --> 52:42.627
if their lives
depended on it.

52:42.727 --> 52:43.628
Yeah, that, too.

52:43.728 --> 52:45.396
You looked at Daniels
specifically?

52:45.496 --> 52:47.365
We did a two-month
assets investigation.

52:47.465 --> 52:49.267
He's got a couple
hundred thousand more

52:49.367 --> 52:50.668
in liquid assets

52:50.768 --> 52:52.970
than any police lieutenant
should ever have.

52:53.070 --> 52:54.805
Maybe he goes
to Atlantic City.

52:54.905 --> 52:57.007
Seriously.

52:57.107 --> 52:58.476
You look at
his background?

52:58.576 --> 53:00.678
Maybe he's got other
sources of income.

53:00.778 --> 53:03.281
Maybe he does.
We never got the chance
to go further.

53:03.381 --> 53:05.683
- Why not?
- We brought it back
to your agency,

53:05.783 --> 53:08.219
the deputy
for operations.
Told him what we had.

53:08.319 --> 53:09.954
You took it to Burrell?

53:10.054 --> 53:11.556
He says, "Thank you,
we'll take it from here."

53:11.656 --> 53:13.758
So we backed away and waited
for something to happen.

53:13.858 --> 53:15.760
And waited.

53:15.860 --> 53:17.228
And that
was a year ago?

53:17.328 --> 53:19.297
Maybe more.

53:19.397 --> 53:22.066
And that fucker's still
a supervisor for narcotics.

53:22.166 --> 53:24.669
So, you tell me
what the hell's going on.

53:28.273 --> 53:29.940
Anyway,

53:30.040 --> 53:32.910
he's running your case,
I just thought you'd
want to know.

53:33.010 --> 53:34.412
Thanks.

53:34.512 --> 53:36.681
( ignition starting )

53:46.190 --> 53:48.559
* Oh, yeah

53:50.160 --> 53:52.897
* Oh, yeah.

53:52.997 --> 53:55.433
