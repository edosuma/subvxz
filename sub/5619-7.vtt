00:02.337 --> 00:04.839
<i>Previously on Marvel's</i>
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.923 --> 00:06.925
Why do you want
to rebuild the portal, Jemma?

00:07.050 --> 00:08.510
<i>Because I have to
get back there.</i>

00:08.593 --> 00:10.261
I've run dozens of simulations.

00:10.387 --> 00:12.013
The Monolith
was just one option though.

00:12.097 --> 00:13.098
We're not gonna give up, okay?

00:14.015 --> 00:15.767
What is it,
some kind of suspension gel?

00:15.850 --> 00:17.060
It keeps them in stasis.

00:17.143 --> 00:19.646
Alive, healthy, just asleep.

00:19.729 --> 00:22.732
Strucker, where do I find Ward?

00:22.816 --> 00:25.860
I tried to do what Ward wanted.
I tried to kill him.

00:25.944 --> 00:27.070
Professor Garner?

00:56.266 --> 00:58.893
Did you just spoil a perfect moment
by capturing it?

00:58.977 --> 01:00.186
You looked too good,

01:00.270 --> 01:01.730
sun hitting you like that.

01:04.649 --> 01:06.568
You know, this time tomorrow
we'll be home.

01:07.193 --> 01:08.611
Look who's spoiling the moment now.

01:11.406 --> 01:14.909
What would you say
if I didn't go back to S.H.I.E.L.D.?

01:18.830 --> 01:19.914
You're serious?

01:21.166 --> 01:22.792
At least not right away.

01:22.876 --> 01:25.336
So, is this the island talking?
Or are you, I mean...

01:25.420 --> 01:28.173
There are a lot of reasons
why this won't work.

01:28.256 --> 01:29.924
Why we won't work.

01:30.008 --> 01:31.760
Somehow I forgot how direct you are.

01:32.343 --> 01:34.220
I don't want to be one of those reasons.

01:34.304 --> 01:38.516
And you won't be.
Listen, we're older now, and wiser.

01:38.600 --> 01:41.436
And I don't plan on losing you
a second time.

01:41.978 --> 01:44.022
So what do you say?

01:44.481 --> 01:46.274
Wanna go steady?

01:49.819 --> 01:51.446
Weren't we just talking about
how we're older?

01:51.529 --> 01:52.989
Yes.

01:53.072 --> 01:54.115
All right then.

01:55.074 --> 01:58.036
To new beginnings.

01:59.996 --> 02:02.081
To new beginnings.

02:06.753 --> 02:08.463
I don't know when Melinda's
coming back, Phil.

02:08.545 --> 02:09.881
We only got home a couple of days ago.

02:11.007 --> 02:13.760
Wanted to thank you for sending over
Jiaying's things from Afterlife.

02:13.843 --> 02:15.136
<i>Hopefully they'll help</i>

02:15.220 --> 02:17.680
<i>shed some light on our
new Inhuman situation.</i>

02:17.764 --> 02:20.183
I'll keep you posted
if I find anything interesting.

02:20.266 --> 02:22.268
And, Phil.

02:22.352 --> 02:23.937
I wouldn't wait for Melinda to call you.

02:24.020 --> 02:25.939
<i>Good advice. Thanks.</i>

02:26.022 --> 02:27.315
All right.

02:32.862 --> 02:34.364
Oh, God!

02:53.842 --> 02:55.009
We're not monsters.

02:55.093 --> 02:56.761
You can't just lock us up
in some ICE prison

02:56.845 --> 02:58.304
because you don't know
what else to do.

02:58.388 --> 02:59.848
No one's talking prison.

02:59.931 --> 03:02.392
And technically it's a gel matrix.

03:02.475 --> 03:04.102
They're putting people in stasis.

03:04.185 --> 03:06.187
Think of it as
a medically induced coma.

03:06.271 --> 03:09.524
A way to hit the pause button
until we find a better solution.

03:09.607 --> 03:11.401
A better solution?
What does that mean?

03:11.484 --> 03:12.777
The ATCU's looking for a cure.

03:12.861 --> 03:14.696
I'm not suggesting that's for everyone,
because it's not.

03:14.779 --> 03:15.822
But some people might want to...

03:15.905 --> 03:16.990
We are not a disease.

03:17.073 --> 03:18.157
I didn't say that you were.

03:18.241 --> 03:20.702
You can't just expect people
to go through that kind of change

03:20.785 --> 03:22.537
and immediately have a handle on it.

03:22.620 --> 03:24.163
Do you remember
how scared I was at first?

03:24.247 --> 03:25.623
Yes. I also remember you ICE'd yourself

03:25.707 --> 03:27.542
so that you wouldn't hurt any of us.

03:27.625 --> 03:29.294
You gotta admit,
things are getting out of hand.

03:29.377 --> 03:30.420
I know.

03:30.503 --> 03:32.171
People are changing
in uncontrolled environments...

03:32.255 --> 03:35.133
I know, but everyone deserves
a chance to be who they are.

03:35.216 --> 03:36.259
That's where you're wrong.

03:36.342 --> 03:38.219
You're being seduced
by your own experience.

03:38.303 --> 03:40.722
Just because you learned
how to control your powers

03:40.805 --> 03:42.849
doesn't mean everyone else will.

03:42.932 --> 03:46.019
I mean, what if a person's hurting
themselves or those around them?

03:46.102 --> 03:48.062
What if they can't stop?

03:48.688 --> 03:49.731
Take Lash.

03:49.814 --> 03:52.734
If putting a bullet in that monster's head
doesn't do the trick,

03:52.817 --> 03:53.860
then what?

03:53.943 --> 03:55.528
That's not fair. That's one guy.

03:55.612 --> 03:58.156
Most Inhumans fall somewhere
between me and him.

03:58.239 --> 03:59.782
And that's the message I'm hoping

03:59.866 --> 04:03.244
the President and his advisors will hear
when I meet with them today.

04:03.328 --> 04:05.413
The President of the United States?

04:05.496 --> 04:07.832
It's off-the-books, but the global
community's coming together

04:07.916 --> 04:10.126
to discuss the future
of Enhanced people.

04:10.209 --> 04:11.920
We're meeting at NORAD in Colorado.

04:12.003 --> 04:13.963
But S.H.I.E.L.D.
isn't supposed to exist.

04:14.047 --> 04:16.466
That's why I'm going in as a consultant
for the ATCU.

04:16.548 --> 04:18.843
- So Rosalind Price...
- Arranged it, yes.

04:18.927 --> 04:22.388
We're taking Zephyr One,
picking her up on the way.

04:22.472 --> 04:23.723
Are you sure this is a good idea?

04:23.806 --> 04:25.642
We can't afford to miss it.

04:25.725 --> 04:28.102
That's why I want you to talk to Rosalind
before the meeting.

04:28.478 --> 04:29.854
Win her over to your side of things.

04:29.938 --> 04:32.482
It could be a real start toward
legitimizing S.H.I.E.L.D.

04:32.565 --> 04:35.777
But it might help if you can present
a successful Inhuman case.

04:35.860 --> 04:37.612
One that's not an extreme
on either side.

04:37.695 --> 04:39.948
Joey Gutierrez is
due for reassessment.

04:40.031 --> 04:41.074
I'd be more than happy
to check in on him,

04:41.157 --> 04:42.241
see how he's progressing.

04:42.325 --> 04:43.409
It couldn't hurt.

04:43.493 --> 04:44.744
I agree.

04:44.827 --> 04:46.287
I can send you my report
while you're in the air.

04:47.038 --> 04:48.498
Thank you for your help on this.

04:49.207 --> 04:51.209
It's what I'm here for.

04:54.879 --> 04:57.298
No, I just don't know
why you're calling me.

04:58.967 --> 05:01.219
All right. Give me your location,
I'll meet you there.

05:02.220 --> 05:03.471
- Dr Garner.
- Hey...

05:03.554 --> 05:06.557
Looks like you're headed to the lab.
That's a good sign, right?

05:06.683 --> 05:09.018
I'm trying. We're trying.

05:10.144 --> 05:12.063
Sometimes it just feels like
it would've been best

05:12.188 --> 05:14.065
if I hadn't told Fitz everything.

05:14.190 --> 05:16.818
You did the right thing
in telling the truth, Jemma.

05:16.901 --> 05:20.697
Secrets can eat you up from the inside.

05:39.424 --> 05:40.758
You busy?

05:41.384 --> 05:42.927
Uh, no. No.

05:43.011 --> 05:44.512
Sorry I haven't been in here more.

05:44.595 --> 05:46.681
There's no need to explain.

05:47.724 --> 05:48.766
What's that?

05:49.267 --> 05:50.393
It's my phone.

05:50.852 --> 05:52.186
I had it with me.

05:52.270 --> 05:55.189
I took pictures, made some recordings
to document my time there.

05:55.273 --> 05:56.524
It's quite damaged,

05:56.607 --> 05:59.193
but I kept it on me as a remembrance.

05:59.277 --> 06:01.279
- I was hoping you could...
- Recover the data?

06:01.404 --> 06:02.530
It's probably pointless.

06:02.613 --> 06:03.698
Yeah, no. Maybe not.

06:04.198 --> 06:07.285
- I just thought if you saw for...
- Myself, yeah.

06:07.410 --> 06:10.955
I always felt better having you
as my second pair of eyes.

06:12.248 --> 06:14.792
Well, it couldn't hurt to try.
I'll get right on it.

06:14.917 --> 06:16.544
Thank you, Fitz.

06:25.803 --> 06:29.140
But I didn't know
he changed into that thing.

06:32.977 --> 06:35.063
You worried about Andrew?

06:35.146 --> 06:37.982
Or pissed that the Strucker kid
went comatose before he could talk?

06:39.942 --> 06:43.154
Well, everyone at HQ says
that Andrew's fine.

06:44.155 --> 06:45.948
And as far as HYDRA,

06:46.491 --> 06:48.159
we'll get 'em.

06:50.328 --> 06:52.497
I hope you stick around.

06:52.997 --> 06:55.333
HYDRA's not the only thing
we're facing these days.

06:55.458 --> 06:57.502
Between the Inhumans,
this monster we're hunting,

06:57.627 --> 06:59.754
and the ATCU on our ass,

06:59.837 --> 07:02.090
we need all the help that we can get.

07:02.173 --> 07:03.341
Monster?

07:03.466 --> 07:06.761
Yeah. Big ugly thing.
Likes to kill other Inhumans.

07:06.844 --> 07:08.096
You've been tracking him?

07:08.179 --> 07:11.849
Trying. Transforms into a man,
which makes him impossible to find.

07:49.804 --> 07:51.139
May.

07:51.222 --> 07:54.100
Hi. Oh, my God, it's good to see you.

07:54.851 --> 07:55.935
I gotta go.

07:56.018 --> 07:57.395
Go where?

07:57.478 --> 07:59.397
I need to talk to Andrew.

07:59.480 --> 08:02.733
He's doing a psych eval
on one of the new Inhuman recruits.

08:02.817 --> 08:04.569
I checked the containment room.
He's not...

08:04.652 --> 08:06.320
No. He's at a training facility off-site.

08:08.030 --> 08:09.323
Where?

08:32.513 --> 08:34.307
I can actually create things now.

08:35.725 --> 08:37.226
How does that make you feel?

08:37.934 --> 08:39.020
Excited, you know.

08:39.979 --> 08:42.690
I have so much more control now.

08:51.616 --> 08:52.658
<i>Dr Garner?</i>

08:56.204 --> 08:57.288
Control.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.916
Yes, that's important.

09:00.708 --> 09:03.669
Daisy thinks I could be a real asset
to S.H.I.E.L.D.

09:04.795 --> 09:07.173
But she said my fate is in your hands.

09:07.965 --> 09:11.135
Yes, Joey. It is.

09:27.276 --> 09:28.694
Don't put your shirt on for my benefit.

09:33.032 --> 09:36.452
Heard about your HYDRA pool party.
And here I was worried about you.

09:41.040 --> 09:43.793
Never liked Kebo much myself.
Funny name.

09:44.418 --> 09:46.128
Locked me in a trunk...

09:47.088 --> 09:49.048
- You all right?
- Of course.

09:49.131 --> 09:50.341
Good.

09:51.175 --> 09:52.677
'Cause taking out
some of Ward's key players

09:52.760 --> 09:54.929
brings us one step closer
to finding the bastard.

09:55.012 --> 09:56.180
No.

09:56.264 --> 09:57.848
Coulson's busy with Daisy,
so now's as good a time as any...

09:57.932 --> 09:59.225
Hunter, it's just...

10:00.476 --> 10:01.852
It's not a good idea.

10:05.356 --> 10:06.482
Is this about Andrew?

10:06.565 --> 10:08.067
'Cause I thought we were past all that.

10:08.150 --> 10:10.236
Now that he's all right, I mean.

10:11.028 --> 10:13.322
Okay, did things get
slightly out of control? Yes.

10:13.406 --> 10:15.032
But nothing
I couldn't handle, obviously.

10:15.116 --> 10:17.451
And everything I did was to protect you.

10:17.535 --> 10:19.245
Bob, will you stop for one second?

10:19.328 --> 10:21.497
I don't want either of us
to go after Ward.

10:22.748 --> 10:24.375
You're joking, right?

10:25.459 --> 10:26.711
Since when?

10:28.587 --> 10:29.922
Whatever it is, lay it on me.

10:30.881 --> 10:32.550
I think you've been reckless and stupid.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.844
- Can I take back what I just said?
- And for what?

10:34.927 --> 10:38.431
So Ward won't lay a bloody finger
on you again, that's what.

10:39.098 --> 10:41.350
Yeah, I'm stupid, because I love you.

10:41.434 --> 10:43.352
I don't need
a knight in shining armour, Hunter.

10:43.436 --> 10:45.271
- I know...
- I need you, alive.

10:48.065 --> 10:49.483
I don't want to lose you.

10:50.735 --> 10:51.819
Okay, you're right.

10:53.362 --> 10:55.323
Or lose ourselves.

10:56.032 --> 11:00.619
Become so obsessed with revenge
that we turn into monsters just like him.

11:20.139 --> 11:22.266
Never walked onto a flying base before.

11:22.350 --> 11:24.185
Guess I can cross that
off my bucket list.

11:25.102 --> 11:26.771
So, where does the tour begin?

11:26.854 --> 11:30.399
That's actually up to Daisy.
She's gonna show you around.

11:56.092 --> 11:58.302
<i>Happy Birthday, Jemma.</i>

11:58.386 --> 12:01.055
<i>Happy Birthday, Jemma.
It's not the same without you here.</i>

12:01.138 --> 12:03.391
<i>Say hi to your parents for me,
and I'll see you soon.</i>

12:07.061 --> 12:08.145
Wow.

12:08.229 --> 12:10.731
Two moons, bloody hell.

12:32.670 --> 12:33.754
<i>Fitz.</i>

12:35.089 --> 12:39.301
<i>It's possible I'm on one of the poles,
but it's strange.</i>

12:39.385 --> 12:40.761
<i>The stars and the two moons,</i>

12:40.845 --> 12:43.556
<i>they keep disappearing
and reappearing,</i>

12:43.639 --> 12:45.182
<i>but there's no sun.</i>

12:46.308 --> 12:47.893
<i>There's never a sun.</i>

12:50.938 --> 12:53.899
Last time you saw me, I was a wreck.

12:53.983 --> 12:56.485
Now, I feel empowered.

12:59.029 --> 13:00.698
That probably sounds stupid.

13:00.781 --> 13:03.576
Sounds like you've grown
to accept that this is a part of you.

13:05.286 --> 13:07.746
Honestly, as a construction guy,

13:07.830 --> 13:09.665
the idea that I could build in a day

13:09.748 --> 13:12.042
something that would
normally take months,

13:12.126 --> 13:13.210
it's unreal.

13:13.294 --> 13:14.795
Or tear something down.

13:14.879 --> 13:17.006
Yeah, if I have to.

13:17.089 --> 13:18.340
Just like that.

13:20.634 --> 13:23.512
Daisy's trying to put together
a team of soldiers, right?

13:24.472 --> 13:26.515
- To fight.
- Hmm. To fight evil.

13:26.599 --> 13:28.809
I could be a real weapon against it.

13:28.893 --> 13:33.355
A dangerous weapon.
That's what I'm worried about.

13:34.356 --> 13:36.775
- We weren't expecting anyone to...
- Melinda? What's going on?

13:36.859 --> 13:37.985
Take Mr Gutierrez back to HQ.

13:38.068 --> 13:39.236
We're in the middle of a session...

13:39.320 --> 13:40.654
Not any more.

13:40.738 --> 13:42.948
- Do it. Now.
- Ma'am, we have protocols.

13:43.032 --> 13:44.742
Take care of them. Then go.

13:45.659 --> 13:46.744
Come on.

13:52.082 --> 13:53.209
What's all this about?

13:53.292 --> 13:56.128
We need to talk. Once we're alone.

13:58.130 --> 13:59.256
Let's go.

14:00.382 --> 14:01.675
Thanks for coming.

14:03.511 --> 14:06.096
You can settle down.
No one knows we're here.

14:07.640 --> 14:09.308
You getting any sleep?

14:10.559 --> 14:13.562
It's kind of hard
when I'm being hunted nonstop.

14:13.646 --> 14:14.855
But I'm really only worried about the one

14:14.939 --> 14:17.525
who wants to blast a hole
through my chest.

14:17.608 --> 14:19.610
If you've got intel on the guy,
why not call Daisy?

14:19.693 --> 14:21.195
'Cause I can't
put her life at risk, too.

14:23.072 --> 14:24.532
I went looking for my friends,

14:26.158 --> 14:27.910
and those who aren't missing are dead.

14:29.828 --> 14:31.372
And you're telling me this why?

14:31.455 --> 14:34.208
Because you fought by my side
against that thing.

14:34.291 --> 14:35.751
It eliminates you as a suspect.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.127
Why would I be a suspect?

14:37.211 --> 14:38.295
Because you're with S.H.I.E.L.D.

14:38.963 --> 14:41.507
Okay, I'm not sure I'm following.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.093
Lash is in S.H.I.E.L.D.

14:45.844 --> 14:48.472
And with your help, I can prove it.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.767
I appreciate you
showing me around like this.

14:54.311 --> 14:56.772
We built this module
to help those in transition.

14:56.855 --> 15:01.193
It's made out of adaptive material,
so it can contain all sorts of powers.

15:02.111 --> 15:03.279
It's also bulletproof,

15:03.362 --> 15:06.782
which comes in handy when people
like you shoot at people like me.

15:08.659 --> 15:11.412
And you really think
this is more humane?

15:12.162 --> 15:14.873
Our goal is to observe people,
educate them.

15:14.957 --> 15:17.042
And yes, it can take time. But...

15:17.126 --> 15:19.211
We don't always have that luxury.

15:19.295 --> 15:22.256
But throwing people away
like they don't even exist is the answer?

15:22.339 --> 15:24.508
- That's not what we're doing.
- Sure as hell looks like it.

15:24.592 --> 15:26.135
Well, it's not that simple.

15:28.262 --> 15:32.141
Just admit it.
You're afraid of people like me.

15:32.224 --> 15:33.934
Afraid of our power.

15:34.018 --> 15:35.144
Absolutely.

15:36.478 --> 15:39.148
Do you even know your own strength?

15:39.231 --> 15:41.066
Could you take down this plane,
for instance?

15:41.150 --> 15:42.192
I wouldn't do that.

15:42.276 --> 15:44.153
But if you wanted to,

15:44.612 --> 15:46.322
you could kill me right now.

15:46.822 --> 15:48.407
Mankind's scary enough as it is.

15:48.490 --> 15:50.451
Some psycho gets a gun,
and watch out.

15:50.534 --> 15:52.328
But now, people are their own weapon.

15:52.411 --> 15:53.537
Not everyone is like...

15:53.621 --> 15:55.456
Some is enough. That's all it takes.

15:55.539 --> 15:57.708
- You only see the terrible things.
- That's not true.

15:57.791 --> 15:58.876
I protect people...

15:58.959 --> 16:01.003
- It doesn't matter.
- How can you say that?

16:01.086 --> 16:03.714
Because for every Daisy Johnson
there's a Lash.

16:03.797 --> 16:05.841
And it's ignorant
for you to think otherwise.

16:13.599 --> 16:15.309
Melinda, talk to me.

16:16.352 --> 16:17.770
What's all this about?

16:18.604 --> 16:23.609
I need to know for myself
before anyone else gets involved.

16:23.692 --> 16:24.777
Know what?

16:24.860 --> 16:27.029
I saw your flight logs,
I tracked your movements.

16:27.112 --> 16:30.115
You were within 30 miles
of at least five Inhuman deaths.

16:30.199 --> 16:31.450
Why were you looking at my flight logs?

16:31.533 --> 16:33.077
I pulled your medical files, too.

16:34.870 --> 16:36.205
Your blood work was deleted.

16:36.288 --> 16:37.665
Maybe Simmons accidentally...

16:37.748 --> 16:39.750
You thought you covered your tracks,
but you didn't.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.919
Melinda, honestly,
what are you getting at?

16:42.002 --> 16:44.254
That Von Strucker kid was alive.

16:45.255 --> 16:47.716
He didn't die in that blast.

16:50.803 --> 16:52.304
I tracked him down.

16:55.307 --> 16:56.684
He told me what you did.

16:56.767 --> 16:59.311
What I did? So some kid says...

16:59.395 --> 17:00.813
He wasn't lying.

17:01.689 --> 17:02.898
The look on his face,

17:05.233 --> 17:06.568
it was pure terror.

17:09.655 --> 17:10.906
What happened to you?

17:11.949 --> 17:13.534
- You can tell me.
- Melinda...

17:13.617 --> 17:15.285
Don't lie to me.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.869
You don't want to know.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.330
- He said you were a monster.
- Melinda, don't.

17:19.415 --> 17:21.500
How could this even happen?

17:21.583 --> 17:22.710
Melinda, stop.

17:22.792 --> 17:24.252
Andrew, please.

17:24.336 --> 17:26.171
- Please...
- Stop!

17:37.266 --> 17:38.767
<i>It's been three weeks, Fitz.</i>

17:39.768 --> 17:41.228
<i>If I don't find something...</i>

17:41.311 --> 17:45.065
<i>If I don't eat, I won't make it.</i>

17:49.945 --> 17:51.113
<i>Fitz, hi.</i>

17:52.489 --> 17:55.325
<i>I don't know why I'm still talking to you.</i>

17:55.409 --> 17:57.494
<i>Why I'm recording myself.</i>

17:58.662 --> 18:00.914
<i>You're never gonna see this, are you?</i>

18:05.210 --> 18:09.047
<i>I still haven't found water.
And it's, uh...</i>

18:09.131 --> 18:12.301
<i>I just... I'm having trouble focusing.</i>

18:12.384 --> 18:17.598
<i>I'm trying to stay positive,
but I'm scared.</i>

18:18.348 --> 18:19.892
<i>I'm scared, Fitz.</i>

18:23.187 --> 18:25.439
<i>Do you remember when we first met?</i>

18:26.190 --> 18:27.816
<i>I do.</i>

18:27.900 --> 18:31.361
<i>You were so quiet and pasty</i>

18:31.445 --> 18:35.407
<i>and so incredibly smart, handsome...</i>

18:38.911 --> 18:42.831
<i>Quite a strange feeling, isn't it?
Never wanting to be without someone?</i>

18:43.749 --> 18:47.127
<i>You must've been so annoyed,
me following you around all the time.</i>

18:47.211 --> 18:49.797
No. Never.

18:50.506 --> 18:54.051
<i>I imagine our dinner sometimes.
Where we'd go, what we'd eat.</i>

18:54.134 --> 18:56.720
<i>I wonder about us a lot, actually.</i>

18:59.181 --> 19:00.641
<i>There's this small cottage in Perthshire</i>

19:00.724 --> 19:03.185
<i>we drove by once when I was a girl.</i>

19:05.062 --> 19:06.355
<i>Some family holiday.</i>

19:06.438 --> 19:08.565
<i>I don't know why,</i>

19:09.608 --> 19:11.610
<i>but I found it so lovely.</i>

19:13.320 --> 19:15.072
<i>I still think about it.</i>

19:16.698 --> 19:18.951
A place where you and I could've...

19:21.870 --> 19:24.122
But that's that, I suppose.

19:26.458 --> 19:29.044
<i>I'm not sure how long
this battery'll last.</i>

19:29.127 --> 19:31.672
I should save it, just in case,

19:32.589 --> 19:36.218
if there are more important things,
if there's anything.

19:37.719 --> 19:40.681
But I'll still talk to you on my own
if that's all right.

19:43.100 --> 19:45.269
I'll always be with you, Fitz.

20:08.458 --> 20:09.835
Oh, thank God you're awake.

20:09.918 --> 20:12.462
I am so sorry. I didn't wanna hurt you.

20:12.546 --> 20:14.131
I panicked.

20:15.340 --> 20:16.383
Where are we?

20:17.885 --> 20:20.721
We couldn't stay there.
Not with S.H.I.E.L.D.

20:20.804 --> 20:23.223
I needed time to explain.

20:23.307 --> 20:26.310
You don't know
how many times I almost told you.

20:26.393 --> 20:28.729
I just... I didn't know how.

20:28.812 --> 20:30.397
I didn't ask for this.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.523
Oh, God!

20:33.692 --> 20:34.735
What have you done?

20:35.402 --> 20:36.820
Huh?

20:36.904 --> 20:37.988
Melinda, don't.

20:38.071 --> 20:40.324
- Don't. You can't.
- Let me go!

20:40.407 --> 20:42.743
Don't do that! I don't know what I'll do.

20:44.494 --> 20:48.582
Instinct will take over again,
like it did at the convenience store.

20:49.124 --> 20:50.167
Instinct?

20:50.250 --> 20:54.212
I didn't want to hurt anyone,
but I didn't know what was happening.

20:54.296 --> 20:56.131
You killed all those people.

21:00.218 --> 21:01.261
How?

21:02.596 --> 21:04.431
When did this... When did...

21:04.514 --> 21:05.599
After Hawaii.

21:08.101 --> 21:10.228
Daisy's mom kept records.

21:11.063 --> 21:13.982
<i>I was going through them,
for any insight, for research,</i>

21:15.067 --> 21:16.360
<i>and I found a book.</i>

21:16.443 --> 21:18.153
<i>It had all these names of Inhumans.</i>

21:18.236 --> 21:21.114
<i>Now, Jiaying must have rigged it
with a Terrigen Crystal</i>

21:21.198 --> 21:24.034
<i>to keep out anyone
who couldn't survive the Mist.</i>

21:25.452 --> 21:26.912
Lucky me.

21:33.168 --> 21:36.254
<i>At first I was relieved, I survived.</i>

21:36.338 --> 21:38.131
<i>But I knew something had happened.</i>

21:38.215 --> 21:40.759
<i>I felt sick, nauseous.</i>

21:40.842 --> 21:45.013
<i>There was this intense pulsing,
like my heart was in my head.</i>

21:46.848 --> 21:49.768
<i>I felt different. Like...</i>

21:49.851 --> 21:52.854
<i>Like a part of me was unlocked.</i>

21:53.563 --> 21:54.940
Unlocked?

21:55.023 --> 21:57.484
I don't know how else to...
I just... I had to...

21:57.567 --> 22:01.196
It was as if I was compelled.
I had to be near them.

22:02.239 --> 22:03.532
The Inhumans?

22:03.615 --> 22:07.703
I didn't know why. It was intense.
I had this new desire.

22:07.786 --> 22:11.081
I had a hunger on my skin.

22:11.164 --> 22:13.709
<i>It wasn't until I finally met one
that my body took over</i>

22:15.502 --> 22:17.170
<i>and I lashed out.</i>

22:17.254 --> 22:18.755
<i>And then I felt relief.</i>

22:19.756 --> 22:20.799
<i>But with you...</i>

22:20.882 --> 22:22.259
Andrew?

22:22.342 --> 22:23.677
You in there?

22:23.760 --> 22:27.055
<i>You wouldn't understand.
I had to keep you away.</i>

22:27.139 --> 22:28.432
That's why you...

22:28.515 --> 22:31.184
Yeah, I was a coward. I wanted
to tell you, but I was worried that...

22:31.268 --> 22:32.644
You have to know.

22:32.728 --> 22:35.647
I didn't end things with you
because I don't love you.

22:35.731 --> 22:37.315
I did it to protect you.

22:37.399 --> 22:40.402
I'm still in love with you, Melinda.

22:41.611 --> 22:43.321
And I need your help.

22:47.159 --> 22:51.079
Where did they go after
May dismissed the security detail?

22:51.163 --> 22:52.873
Update me as you know more.

22:54.958 --> 22:56.126
Everything all right?

22:56.209 --> 22:57.878
Not sure yet.

22:57.961 --> 23:00.547
Could be as simple as
a workplace romance gone wrong.

23:01.214 --> 23:02.883
That doesn't sound simple.

23:03.341 --> 23:04.676
I think you were in the middle
of telling me

23:04.760 --> 23:06.261
what great friends
you and Daisy are now.

23:06.344 --> 23:08.680
I may have overstepped.

23:08.764 --> 23:11.475
But one thing's for certain,
that girl's got fire.

23:12.684 --> 23:14.144
And you still haven't
told anyone about her?

23:14.227 --> 23:15.520
I keep my promises, Phil.

23:15.604 --> 23:17.397
They have no idea.

23:18.857 --> 23:20.108
New look?

23:20.192 --> 23:21.568
Old look, actually.

23:22.069 --> 23:23.403
It's been a while, though.

23:23.487 --> 23:24.863
Uh, may I?

23:26.114 --> 23:27.157
Oh.

23:27.324 --> 23:28.575
Sure.

23:35.332 --> 23:37.459
So, you gonna tell me
what really happened?

23:37.542 --> 23:40.212
'Cause I'm not quite buying
the shark attack bit.

23:40.295 --> 23:41.379
You're not buying that?

23:43.715 --> 23:45.092
One of my men cut it off.

23:46.093 --> 23:47.761
Saved my life.

23:47.844 --> 23:49.346
By chopping off your hand?

23:49.429 --> 23:51.431
You kind of had to be there.

23:53.892 --> 23:55.060
Does it hurt?

23:55.519 --> 23:56.645
Every day.

23:57.729 --> 23:59.439
Phantom pain.

23:59.523 --> 24:02.526
The thing that's missing
is the thing that you feel the most.

24:02.609 --> 24:04.694
Makes it hard to forget.

24:04.778 --> 24:06.488
So maybe you don't.

24:06.571 --> 24:08.657
But it's also important to look ahead,

24:09.282 --> 24:10.992
see what's in front of you.

24:16.748 --> 24:17.874
We close to NORAD?

24:17.958 --> 24:20.544
No, another Quinjet's
requested to dock.

24:25.966 --> 24:28.218
Lincoln? What are you doing here?

24:28.301 --> 24:29.386
Where'd you find him?

24:29.469 --> 24:31.304
He came to me. He's got intel on Lash.

24:31.388 --> 24:32.430
She ATCU?

24:33.056 --> 24:34.266
We're working together now.

24:34.349 --> 24:36.059
Yeah, we all want to catch that thing.

24:36.143 --> 24:39.729
Well, Mr Campbell, you've come
this far, what do you have to say?

24:41.106 --> 24:44.526
Those of us from Afterlife,
we were trained to blend in.

24:44.860 --> 24:45.902
Afterlife?

24:45.986 --> 24:47.028
I'll explain later.

24:47.112 --> 24:48.613
And yet that thing
keeps finding us.

24:48.697 --> 24:50.157
Killed most of my friends.

24:50.240 --> 24:51.408
Lincoln gave me names.

24:51.491 --> 24:53.702
I checked them against the bodies
we could identify.

24:53.785 --> 24:57.038
That's how I knew Lash was using
Jiaying's ledger to find us.

24:57.122 --> 24:58.165
Her ledger?

24:58.248 --> 25:00.125
She kept a genealogy of Inhumans.

25:00.792 --> 25:02.335
She was the only one allowed to use it.

25:03.044 --> 25:05.881
- Until...
- Until S.H.I.E.L.D. recovered it.

25:05.964 --> 25:08.300
And there's only one person
I know who had access.

25:08.383 --> 25:09.968
Dr Garner?

25:10.051 --> 25:11.636
But there's no way, it's not possible.

25:11.720 --> 25:13.096
I didn't want to believe it either.

25:15.348 --> 25:18.685
So, you're not just saying Andrew
has the ledger, you're saying...

25:21.396 --> 25:23.899
I saw May access
his flight logs this morning.

25:23.982 --> 25:27.068
I talked with her.
She was upset, but I thought that she...

25:27.152 --> 25:28.904
She and Andrew are missing.
I just got word.

25:28.987 --> 25:30.071
Oh, God.

25:30.447 --> 25:32.157
Reroute the plane. New York.

25:32.240 --> 25:33.366
Pull all the satellite footage
from the Cocoon.

25:33.450 --> 25:34.659
We need to find them.

25:34.743 --> 25:36.036
Yes, sir.

25:36.119 --> 25:37.662
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

25:37.746 --> 25:39.664
but the President's
gonna have to wait.

25:39.748 --> 25:41.666
Whatever you need.
I'll let them know.

25:41.750 --> 25:43.126
Andrew wouldn't hurt her.

25:43.210 --> 25:44.252
He's killed dozens of us.

25:44.336 --> 25:47.130
Yeah, but what if he doesn't know
what he's doing once he turns?

25:47.214 --> 25:48.298
He blacks out or something.

25:48.381 --> 25:50.550
Inhumans can't change form.
That's not how it works.

25:50.634 --> 25:51.927
I saw it myself.

25:52.010 --> 25:54.095
No, what I'm saying is it's temporary.

25:54.179 --> 25:56.765
He won't always be able to shift
between monster and man.

25:57.349 --> 25:58.642
He's still in transition.

25:59.434 --> 26:00.560
Becoming Inhuman.

26:00.644 --> 26:01.853
And when that transition's complete?

26:01.937 --> 26:04.773
He'll stay Lash. Permanently.

26:04.856 --> 26:08.026
The man you think you know
is disappearing,

26:08.109 --> 26:09.736
if he's not already gone.

26:12.364 --> 26:13.406
Andrew?

26:15.533 --> 26:19.454
If I hadn't shown up,
were you going to hurt Joey?

26:21.081 --> 26:22.207
Of course not.

26:23.458 --> 26:25.669
And you know
I'd never lay a finger on Daisy.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.379
But you went after Lincoln.

26:28.713 --> 26:30.340
That kid has a dark side.

26:31.466 --> 26:34.469
You understand more than anyone.
Look at what happened in Bahrain.

26:34.844 --> 26:35.887
What?

26:35.971 --> 26:39.683
You saw firsthand
what Inhumans were capable of.

26:39.766 --> 26:42.644
If you hadn't killed that little girl,
everyone around you would've suffered.

26:42.727 --> 26:44.020
They all would've died.

26:44.104 --> 26:45.855
But you saved them.

26:45.939 --> 26:48.566
This isn't you.
You would never say that.

26:48.650 --> 26:50.652
No, Melinda.
I know exactly what I'm saying.

26:51.236 --> 26:52.445
You and me,

26:53.071 --> 26:54.489
we're the same.

26:55.156 --> 26:56.574
That's why I need your help.

26:56.658 --> 26:58.994
- I never wanted to hurt that girl.
- I know.

26:59.077 --> 27:02.580
I know. And believe me,
I don't want to do what I'm doing either.

27:05.750 --> 27:07.168
I have to.

27:13.341 --> 27:15.593
I know you think I've lost myself,

27:18.596 --> 27:20.432
but I haven't.

27:21.516 --> 27:22.809
I don't know what to do.

27:22.892 --> 27:23.977
I know.

27:27.772 --> 27:29.983
Do you remember our first apartment?

27:32.068 --> 27:33.320
The one on Cranbrook.

27:33.403 --> 27:38.450
One room, a stupid futon for a bed.
And that winter when it got so cold...

27:38.533 --> 27:40.243
We used the oven as our heater.

27:40.327 --> 27:44.205
Not the safest way to keep warm,
but it did the trick.

27:51.171 --> 27:52.255
Melinda.

27:59.387 --> 28:01.973
World has gotten more complicated,
hasn't it?

28:04.726 --> 28:07.729
I know we can't pretend it all away,

28:07.812 --> 28:10.398
but I'm still the same man
you fell in love with.

28:10.482 --> 28:11.941
I never gave up on you.

28:14.152 --> 28:15.820
Please don't give up on me.

28:22.702 --> 28:23.745
Sorry to interrupt.

28:26.039 --> 28:28.041
I'm still waiting on Joey's reassessment.

28:28.124 --> 28:31.544
Phil, you don't understand.

28:31.628 --> 28:32.962
I'm starting to.

28:35.173 --> 28:36.257
You all right?

28:39.135 --> 28:40.428
We're old friends.

28:40.512 --> 28:44.224
That's why I'd prefer to see
everyone walk out of here unharmed.

28:44.307 --> 28:47.060
But in case you got something else
in mind, I'm not alone.

28:50.271 --> 28:51.898
Containment module's secure.

28:51.981 --> 28:54.526
Copy that.
All teams getting into position.

28:58.488 --> 29:00.156
Remember, this is Coulson's op.

29:00.240 --> 29:03.701
We do not move
unless he gives the order. Go.

29:07.622 --> 29:09.374
He's not gonna come quietly.

29:12.127 --> 29:14.671
<i>This doesn't have
to go down badly.</i>

29:14.754 --> 29:16.089
I'll make sure you're taken care of.

29:16.172 --> 29:18.633
I understand the position you're in, I do.

29:18.716 --> 29:19.843
And I don't envy it.

29:20.510 --> 29:21.886
But I'm trying to help you.

29:21.970 --> 29:24.055
<i>We've got an outbreak on our hands.</i>

29:24.139 --> 29:25.390
What the hell's he mean by that?

29:25.473 --> 29:27.684
Calm down.
Coulson knows what he's doing.

29:27.767 --> 29:29.185
<i>You sure about that?</i>

29:29.269 --> 29:32.063
I'm simply trying to sort
the good from the bad.

29:32.147 --> 29:33.731
You gave me this job.

29:33.815 --> 29:36.776
That's a pretty poor interpretation
of a therapist.

29:37.235 --> 29:39.112
Look around you.

29:39.195 --> 29:42.115
We're in some abandoned building.
May's tied up. You're not okay.

29:42.198 --> 29:46.411
I know how it looks,
but I have a moral responsibility.

29:46.494 --> 29:48.037
You'll see soon.

29:51.040 --> 29:52.584
I'm doing you a favour.

29:54.586 --> 29:55.795
He's insane.

29:55.879 --> 29:57.464
That's not true. He's just sick.

29:57.547 --> 29:59.591
The beast's gonna come out.
You can't control it.

29:59.674 --> 30:02.010
Don't make things worse,
'cause you got an axe to grind.

30:02.093 --> 30:03.428
<i>He's not just gonna
let us take him.</i>

30:03.511 --> 30:04.888
He's gonna defend himself.

30:04.971 --> 30:08.016
Do not engage.
We move on Coulson's order.

30:08.099 --> 30:12.145
I've only killed those who deserve it.

30:18.443 --> 30:21.404
Who the hell made you
judge, jury, and executioner?

30:21.488 --> 30:22.572
What are you doing?

30:22.655 --> 30:24.157
You gotta get him out of here. Now.

30:24.240 --> 30:26.618
- Lincoln.
- You tore my friends apart.

30:27.368 --> 30:28.703
You have no right!

30:28.786 --> 30:30.622
- That's enough.
- Calm down, Andrew. Please.

30:30.705 --> 30:32.665
I have every right.

30:32.749 --> 30:36.169
Andrew, listen to me. We can help you.
The ATCU's close to a cure.

30:43.718 --> 30:46.179
I am the cure.

30:47.597 --> 30:48.681
Get down.

30:56.981 --> 30:59.025
Lincoln and Lash are in
the east wing of the building.

30:59.108 --> 31:01.110
- We have to get him to the module.
<i>- On it, sir.</i>

31:01.194 --> 31:03.655
- Phil.
- Our goal's to capture, not kill.

31:03.738 --> 31:06.658
We just gotta get Lincoln
on the same page. Try those.

31:28.263 --> 31:31.599
Really gotta commit
to that shotgun axe idea.

31:31.683 --> 31:33.101
Could use a little help here.

31:33.184 --> 31:34.686
What's your 20?

31:45.947 --> 31:47.699
Andrew. We're friends.

31:51.494 --> 31:53.371
Or maybe just acquaintances.

31:57.917 --> 31:59.085
We got him.

32:28.906 --> 32:30.074
No!

32:49.969 --> 32:51.012
Thank you.

32:53.890 --> 32:56.392
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

32:57.352 --> 32:58.603
I didn't know you could do that.

32:58.686 --> 33:00.188
That makes two of us.

33:00.271 --> 33:02.231
- Where is he?
- No idea.

33:02.315 --> 33:06.235
But we've gotta get him
to the containment module. Now.

33:15.411 --> 33:17.288
I'll get him to where he needs to go.

33:39.560 --> 33:41.521
Andrew. Stop.

33:42.438 --> 33:43.690
Move.

33:44.649 --> 33:47.860
Go on. Might as well.

33:49.153 --> 33:52.281
I've thought about my death
enough times.

33:52.365 --> 33:54.409
The different ways that I could go.

33:56.994 --> 33:58.746
I just never thought it'd be you.

34:01.749 --> 34:03.459
I never knew why you married me.

34:04.377 --> 34:08.589
I was never as kind
and empathetic as you.

34:10.550 --> 34:12.635
It's why it was so easy for me
to walk away,

34:15.847 --> 34:17.264
why I gave up on you.

34:18.599 --> 34:21.060
I lost something when I left you.

34:21.686 --> 34:23.771
I won't do it again.

34:26.107 --> 34:27.984
But you have to stop this.

34:31.654 --> 34:32.905
Melinda.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.094
How'd you know that wouldn't kill him?

34:57.847 --> 34:59.140
I didn't.

35:07.732 --> 35:09.275
I bloody knew it.

35:10.234 --> 35:11.527
Fitz, you all right?

35:12.153 --> 35:13.279
Yeah, I think I've...

35:14.197 --> 35:15.656
Remember this?

35:17.658 --> 35:19.911
- Yeah, from the castle chamber.
- Okay.

35:21.496 --> 35:22.705
Oh, is that the other man?

35:24.707 --> 35:28.169
Well, I'm just gonna say what we're
all thinking. He has a hog face.

35:28.753 --> 35:30.338
He does have a hog face.

35:30.421 --> 35:34.008
Okay, so look at the logo
of the space programme he's with.

35:36.302 --> 35:38.971
And if you turn it upside down,
they look similar. Yeah?

35:39.597 --> 35:41.432
- Bit of a stretch, mate.
- It's possible.

35:41.516 --> 35:43.100
Okay, well...

35:43.184 --> 35:46.062
What if the group who carved
this symbol into the chamber door

35:46.145 --> 35:47.855
is the same group that sent
Will through the portal?

35:47.939 --> 35:49.106
I thought NASA sent Will through.

35:49.190 --> 35:51.275
Could go beyond NASA. Way beyond.

35:51.359 --> 35:54.070
Please don't tell me you think
some ancient order's behind all this,

35:54.153 --> 35:56.113
'cause that's a bit mental, even for you.

35:56.197 --> 35:57.615
I know how it sounds,

35:57.698 --> 36:00.660
but we're dealing with a portal
that leads to another planet, so...

36:00.743 --> 36:04.080
Anything's possible.
It's worth checking out, Fitz.

36:07.834 --> 36:11.587
You're gonna take Coulson up
on his offer? Stick around for a while?

36:16.676 --> 36:18.052
Can't run forever.

36:21.264 --> 36:24.225
If we put Andrew in stasis as a human,

36:24.308 --> 36:26.853
it'll slow his transformation,

36:26.936 --> 36:28.980
giving us more time to find a cure.

36:29.647 --> 36:32.900
Now, I can't pretend to understand
what you're going through,

36:32.984 --> 36:35.570
but for what it's worth,

36:35.653 --> 36:39.407
if I had the chance to save
someone I love, I'd take it.

36:44.495 --> 36:45.913
What would you do?

36:52.211 --> 36:53.963
Well, it's a temporary solution.

36:54.046 --> 36:56.090
I think we can all acknowledge that.

36:57.174 --> 36:58.759
But Andrew helped me.

36:59.844 --> 37:02.471
So I'd do whatever it takes.

37:07.518 --> 37:08.686
Do it.

37:21.741 --> 37:23.618
Do you need to go after her?

37:24.952 --> 37:27.663
She wouldn't want me to. Not right now.

37:30.499 --> 37:32.043
It's been a long day.

37:32.126 --> 37:33.377
Mmm-hmm.

37:35.087 --> 37:36.380
Buy you a drink?

37:37.757 --> 37:38.966
Please.

37:45.056 --> 37:47.725
Hey. You okay?

37:48.351 --> 37:49.435
I couldn't sleep.

37:49.894 --> 37:52.063
There aren't a lot of windows
in the base, and I wanted to...

37:52.146 --> 37:53.689
Watch the sunrise.

37:57.985 --> 37:59.028
I...

38:00.738 --> 38:02.907
I can't make any promises,

38:02.990 --> 38:05.451
but I think I may have found something,

38:05.534 --> 38:07.203
might help us open up the portal.

38:07.286 --> 38:08.371
Really?

38:11.624 --> 38:12.667
And, um,

38:14.502 --> 38:16.921
fixed your SIM card.

38:17.004 --> 38:20.716
So I heard your recordings
and saw your video.

38:23.302 --> 38:26.305
I didn't know you thought about
settling down in Perthshire.

38:28.224 --> 38:29.266
That's in Scotland.

38:30.393 --> 38:32.395
I know where it is, Fitz.

38:37.566 --> 38:39.276
So, when you said
all those things about...

38:40.736 --> 38:43.072
I mean, you were tired
and dehydrated...

38:43.155 --> 38:45.157
I was as clearheaded then
as I've ever been

38:46.075 --> 38:47.743
when I said all those things.

38:57.169 --> 38:59.422
What do you think
we should do about it?

39:01.757 --> 39:02.967
For now,

39:06.804 --> 39:08.514
let's just watch the sunrise.

39:35.166 --> 39:36.459
What's wrong?

39:37.835 --> 39:38.961
Nothing.

39:41.130 --> 39:43.340
I never thought I deserved this.

39:43.466 --> 39:45.176
What, a trip to Hawaii?

39:45.301 --> 39:46.469
No.

39:50.848 --> 39:52.391
Happiness.

39:54.727 --> 39:56.812
This kind of happiness.

40:00.232 --> 40:02.068
Of course you do.

40:06.322 --> 40:07.823
We both do.

40:08.532 --> 40:09.575
Hmm.

40:36.769 --> 40:38.270
So, why am I here?

40:39.063 --> 40:40.773
We'll get to that.

40:42.191 --> 40:44.693
It's a shame about
Werner Von Strucker.

40:44.777 --> 40:47.780
I hope for your sake
he doesn't wake up.

40:49.198 --> 40:52.451
I'm not worried.
He's weak, like his father.

40:53.077 --> 40:56.789
Ah, careful, Mr Ward.
You paid a price for that boy.

40:56.872 --> 40:58.791
You should ask yourself
if it was worth it.

40:59.375 --> 41:00.876
You gave me his location.

41:00.960 --> 41:02.628
I gave you what you asked for.

41:04.964 --> 41:09.093
I'm just not sure
that you're asking for the right things.

41:10.886 --> 41:13.973
Revenge only provides
a temporary pleasure.

41:15.432 --> 41:16.934
But a pleasure nonetheless.

41:17.309 --> 41:18.477
Ah...

41:19.937 --> 41:22.064
You should think on a grander scale.

41:22.148 --> 41:23.732
Oh, it'll be grand.

41:27.486 --> 41:31.031
I'm gonna cut off the head
of S.H.I.E.L.D.

41:31.115 --> 41:36.203
Because without Phil Coulson,
S.H.I.E.L.D. won't grow back.

41:42.668 --> 41:44.795
Oh...

41:44.920 --> 41:46.255
Excuse me a moment.

41:50.176 --> 41:51.302
Miss Price.

41:51.427 --> 41:53.888
I wanted to apologise for missing
our meeting at NORAD.

41:53.971 --> 41:55.472
I will bring him to you soon enough.

41:57.099 --> 41:59.310
Time is of the essence.

42:00.311 --> 42:02.646
Oh, I better go. I'll be in touch.

42:04.857 --> 42:08.402
You don't have to leave so soon.
How about some breakfast first?

42:08.485 --> 42:09.528
Are you cooking?

42:09.612 --> 42:12.198
I don't cook.
But I'm an expert at going out to eat.

42:12.781 --> 42:13.908
Is there anything good around here?

42:13.991 --> 42:16.202
Ruthie's Diner,
it's about two blocks away.

42:16.285 --> 42:18.454
She makes a mean scramble.

42:19.705 --> 42:21.207
I think I can make time for that.

42:21.290 --> 42:22.458
Good.
