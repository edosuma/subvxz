00:05.397 --> 00:07.080
-Hi.
-Hi.

00:07.233 --> 00:10.325
Ah! I can't believe you're home.

00:10.419 --> 00:12.085
(both exhale)

00:12.179 --> 00:15.014
You, uh, y-you seem good.

00:15.165 --> 00:16.998
I am. Finally.

00:17.092 --> 00:19.351
Uh, wh-where's Chim?

00:19.503 --> 00:21.645
And-and Jee?

00:25.584 --> 00:27.526
(both laughing)

00:28.587 --> 00:30.612
HEN:
Welcome home.

00:31.757 --> 00:33.273
I have missed you.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.350
Missed you, too.
You want a beer?

00:35.369 --> 00:37.369
Yeah.

00:37.596 --> 00:39.705
(door closes)

00:41.116 --> 00:42.499
Maddie not around?

00:47.606 --> 00:49.631
We broke up.

00:51.535 --> 00:53.868
So, we realized somewhere
around St. Louis

00:53.962 --> 00:55.220
that it was over.

00:55.372 --> 00:56.704
After everything
you've been through?

00:56.724 --> 00:58.448
CHIMNEY:
All those other times
we were apart,

00:58.542 --> 01:01.285
it always felt
like it was outside forces.

01:01.378 --> 01:03.211
Ex-husbands, pandemics.

01:03.305 --> 01:04.471
This time, it feels like

01:04.565 --> 01:06.899
the call's coming
from inside the house.

01:08.127 --> 01:09.717
It's hard enough trying
to keep a relationship

01:09.812 --> 01:11.128
together under the same roof.

01:11.221 --> 01:15.157
But not speaking to each other
for six months?

01:17.394 --> 01:18.560
We grew apart.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.245
Or we grew while we were apart,
I guess.

01:20.397 --> 01:23.156
It kind of sounds like he's
punishing you for being sick.

01:23.309 --> 01:25.325
No, that's not what's going on.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.327
We made a mutual decision
together

01:27.421 --> 01:29.237
that this is
what's best for Jee.

01:29.331 --> 01:30.997
So no one is punishing anyone.

01:31.150 --> 01:32.532
Okay? Don't be mad at Chim.

01:32.593 --> 01:33.926
(sighs)
I mean,

01:34.153 --> 01:36.503
I do still owe him
a punch in the face.

01:36.597 --> 01:39.489
I already apologized to Buck.
Everything is fine with us.

01:39.508 --> 01:42.226
I'm ready to get back
with the team.

01:43.086 --> 01:44.603
Mm, yeah.

01:44.754 --> 01:47.589
The team's configuration is just

01:47.683 --> 01:49.833
a little bit different
than when you left.

01:49.926 --> 01:51.835
-Eddie quit?
-Bobby replaced me?

01:51.928 --> 01:54.279
You asked Taylor
to move in with you?

01:54.506 --> 01:56.281
Buck made out
with the new firefighter?

01:56.433 --> 01:58.433
(sighs)

01:58.527 --> 01:59.843
Wow.

01:59.862 --> 02:00.935
Yep.

02:00.955 --> 02:03.013

fell apart without me.

VERN: Yeah, well,
sharks don't mess around.

02:17.696 --> 02:19.713
-So neither do we.
-Uh, uh, this section here

02:19.807 --> 02:23.049
about being "permanently maimed
or physically disfigured"?

02:23.202 --> 02:24.685
(clicking nearby)

02:28.874 --> 02:31.725
I thought I was safer
in the cage than free diving.

02:31.819 --> 02:32.709
You are.

02:32.728 --> 02:34.060
Well, is there anything

02:34.213 --> 02:35.762
safer than the cage?

06:41.217 --> 06:42.234

06:42.461 --> 06:43.718
We could put him
back in the water.

I could take him down,
bring him back up properly.

06:45.597 --> 06:48.407
That's too risky-- we need
to get him in a chamber.

06:48.634 --> 06:51.034
15 minutes?

06:53.155 --> 06:54.896
We could build one faster.

07:01.163 --> 07:03.088
He built his in a meat freezer.

07:03.239 --> 07:05.507
How about a fresh fish freezer?

07:12.658 --> 07:15.325
Buck, kill the power
to the freezer.

07:15.343 --> 07:17.343
He's gonna be in there anywhere
from 30 to 90 minutes.

07:17.496 --> 07:19.921
Could be hypothermic in ten,
okay, even with the power off.

07:20.015 --> 07:23.333
-So we need to pump him
full of warm fluids.
-JONAH: Great call, Hen.

07:23.351 --> 07:25.502
-We could run the I.V. in
with the air.
-JONAH: I'll stay with him.

07:25.595 --> 07:27.279

out there to make him

-HORATIO: Sharks.

So what are you afraid of?

That's a pretty open-ended
question, don't you think?

08:59.188 --> 09:00.855
I mean, I don't love
going to the dentist.

09:00.949 --> 09:02.599
I doubt the fear
of having a cavity filled

09:02.617 --> 09:04.692
is why you blew up
at Captain Nash the way you did.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.102
I apologized for that.

09:06.121 --> 09:07.546
I was upset.

09:07.697 --> 09:09.939
Shouldn't have said
what I said to him.

09:09.958 --> 09:12.133
So why did you?

09:15.280 --> 09:17.630
-How's Christopher?
-Good.

09:17.783 --> 09:19.616
Good. He had a rough patch

09:19.634 --> 09:22.118
-over the holidays,
but he's doing better now.
-Good.

09:22.211 --> 09:23.377

you worry about him.

-(chuckles)
-His well-being.

09:26.049 --> 09:28.567
-Is that a bad thing now?
-Not at all.

09:28.718 --> 09:30.902
I just wonder if you worry
about your own well-being.

09:31.054 --> 09:32.796
You're a man who spends
all of his time

09:32.814 --> 09:34.239

used to say

09:41.489 --> 09:43.564
that pain is nothing
but weakness leaving the body.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.566
-You think pain is weakness?
-It can be.

09:45.660 --> 09:46.901
If you give in to it.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.479
Can't put all your feelings
in a box, Eddie.

09:49.572 --> 09:51.923
You might think if you're
strong enough that it'll hold.

09:52.150 --> 09:54.984
But at some point,
that box is gonna blow open.

09:55.003 --> 09:56.761
And take me with it.

09:56.913 --> 09:59.014
You and anyone else around you.

10:01.993 --> 10:03.101

10:04.754 --> 10:07.606

10:08.683 --> 10:10.091
Could be a while.

10:10.185 --> 10:11.501
Let's take a shortcut.

10:11.519 --> 10:13.612
Maybe you should talk
about your pain

10:13.763 --> 10:15.688
with someone who shares it.

10:15.782 --> 10:18.116
Think about that first trauma.

10:18.267 --> 10:19.676
And then talk to someone

10:19.694 --> 10:23.496
who can understand exactly
what you've been through.

10:24.699 --> 10:27.033
<i> TAYLOR:</i>

Yeah, we'll just have to cull
as we unpack.

10:34.542 --> 10:37.710

two of everything.

10:37.804 --> 10:40.196
Including two couches.

10:40.289 --> 10:41.531
Ah...

10:41.549 --> 10:44.534
Uh, maybe just set it down
over there for now.

-Thanks.
-What exactly are we gonna do
with two couches?

10:48.131 --> 10:50.631
Well, we'll get rid of one.

10:51.467 --> 10:53.935
I'm guessing not the one
they just carried in?

10:54.045 --> 10:55.970
-No.
-Ah.

10:56.064 --> 10:58.323
-So...
-Yeah.

10:58.474 --> 11:01.142
Okay, I will see if anyone
at the firehouse

11:01.161 --> 11:03.144
wants to... buy a couch.

11:03.238 --> 11:05.705
Uh, maybe that new firefighter
needs one.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.908
Uh, you-you mean Lucy?

11:09.060 --> 11:12.245

I wouldn't know.

interacted.

11:14.416 --> 11:17.342

kind of a little...

11:19.662 --> 11:21.587

11:21.740 --> 11:23.348

what her tastes are.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.245
Huh, you know,
you can just ask her.

11:29.264 --> 11:30.930
Do you have good taste?

11:31.082 --> 11:33.099
She says yes,
you'll know she'll love it.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.676
-Good plan.
-Aha.

11:35.696 --> 11:36.936
Okay.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.589
I'm gonna go return my keys
and do a walkthrough

11:39.682 --> 11:41.348

new firefighters around here,

11:54.289 --> 11:56.548

11:59.945 --> 12:02.445

12:02.464 --> 12:05.206
-And just in time for lunch.
-Is it lunchtime?

12:05.892 --> 12:07.892
Can't wait to see
what Cap's cooking.

12:08.119 --> 12:10.061
Let's go.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.897
This is...

12:13.124 --> 12:14.791
not cooked.

12:14.809 --> 12:18.127
What, do you want me to warm it
up for you in the microwave?

12:18.221 --> 12:19.645
-You're saying no to my sushi?
-I'm not saying no.

12:19.798 --> 12:21.631
-I'm saying, "Why?"
-Yeah, but for the record,

12:21.649 --> 12:23.483
I'm saying yes to whatever
he doesn't want, so...

12:23.577 --> 12:25.226
Never mind.
I'll cook something for you.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.078
I have got red snapper,
flounder.

12:27.305 --> 12:30.415
-How do you feel about tilapia?
-How does anyone feel
about tilapia, Cap?

12:30.566 --> 12:32.825
-Yeah.
-Okay, so what's up
with all the fish?

12:32.978 --> 12:34.994
You guys become pescatarians
or something while I was gone?

12:35.146 --> 12:37.422
We had a call at a fish market
the other day.

12:37.573 --> 12:40.258
-And they paid you in flounder?
-BOBBY: Hey.

12:40.451 --> 12:41.926
How about
a little seared salmon?

12:42.153 --> 12:43.595
Little ginger,
little lemon, little garlic?

12:43.746 --> 12:45.488
-What do you say?
-Why not?

12:45.581 --> 12:47.682
All right.

12:49.661 --> 12:50.918
I'm glad you're back.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.753
You seem better.

12:52.773 --> 12:55.648
Glad you guys worked it out.

12:58.094 --> 12:59.685
I don't have a job.

12:59.780 --> 13:01.629
I need to find an apartment.

13:01.631 --> 13:04.007
I used most of my savings
when I left.

13:04.025 --> 13:06.117
And Chimney used most of his
chasing me.

13:06.269 --> 13:08.344
Well, I'm sorry
about the whole apartment thing.

13:08.363 --> 13:09.937
-If I would've known...
-What?

13:09.956 --> 13:11.939
If you had known that I was
coming back, you wouldn't

13:12.033 --> 13:14.441
have asked your girlfriend
to move in with you?

13:15.353 --> 13:18.021
-(chuckles) Hi.
-(Jee-Yun cooing)

13:18.114 --> 13:20.281
Yeah, yeah.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.591
Buck?

13:23.862 --> 13:27.138
Uh, yeah, uh, maybe.

13:29.142 --> 13:32.385
(laughs) Look, basically,
I-I did a dumb thing.

13:32.537 --> 13:34.554
And I wasn't sure
how to tell Taylor,

13:34.648 --> 13:36.648
so instead I...

13:36.875 --> 13:38.632
I did an even dumber thing.

13:38.652 --> 13:40.209
Asking her to move in?

13:40.228 --> 13:42.821
Mm-hmm. And listen, I-I do...

13:42.972 --> 13:44.489
I do love her.

13:44.640 --> 13:46.658
You know, and she's really
been there for me

13:46.809 --> 13:48.475
with you guys gone,
and I-I want to believe

13:48.495 --> 13:51.145
I asked her
for the right reasons.

13:51.239 --> 13:52.497
But?

13:53.333 --> 13:55.500
I can't help but wonder if...

13:55.651 --> 13:59.504
maybe I was just scared
of being left again.

13:59.731 --> 14:01.822
We are a pair.

14:01.916 --> 14:05.009
The fugitive and the settler.

14:05.161 --> 14:08.263
-I'm always running,
you're always...
-Clinging.

14:09.424 --> 14:11.599
(chuckles softly)

14:12.577 --> 14:14.501
I really did miss you.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.521
I missed you, too.

14:18.249 --> 14:20.600
Okay, so you said
that the second dumb thing

14:20.694 --> 14:23.252
you had done was asking Taylor
to move in with you.

14:23.346 --> 14:24.678

plenty of recreation.

16:00.852 --> 16:02.443

20:40.798 --> 20:43.532
Prepping a steroid injection.

20:45.470 --> 20:46.744
I'm just gonna leave
the patient's clothes

20:46.971 --> 20:48.079
right there for animal control.

20:48.230 --> 20:49.413
Well, dispatch said

20:49.565 --> 20:51.064
the homeowner
explicitly forbade them

20:51.233 --> 20:53.066
from entering the home
until he got back from vacation.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.478
But he is happy we found
some of his missing pets.

20:55.571 --> 20:57.329
Is that what you were
doing out here, Cap?

20:57.482 --> 20:58.756
Talking to dispatch?

20:58.907 --> 21:01.984
Nothing to do with a little
undiagnosed arachnophobia?

21:02.077 --> 21:03.669
Come on, Hen.

21:03.821 --> 21:05.337
-He's coding!
-What?

21:05.431 --> 21:07.339
What-what happened?
He was just stable.

21:07.492 --> 21:09.992
Pressure's bottoming out-- might
be a reaction to the steroids.

21:10.085 --> 21:11.660
Wouldn't that increase
the pressure?

21:11.679 --> 21:14.830
Yes, unless he was on some sort
of prescription meds.

21:14.849 --> 21:16.774
-Clear!
-(defibrillator clacks)

21:16.925 --> 21:19.668
-(steady beeping)
-Heart rhythm returning
to normal.

21:19.687 --> 21:20.611
-Nice job.
-Thank you.

21:20.838 --> 21:22.521
You sure he's okay?

21:22.673 --> 21:24.097
Yeah.

21:24.117 --> 21:26.191
Just gave us a scare.

21:27.194 --> 21:29.345
<i> ALBERT:</i>
<i> I still don't understand</i>
<i> why Bobby</i>

21:29.363 --> 21:30.679
would give you so much fish.

21:30.773 --> 21:32.623
They've been eating nothing
but fish all week.

21:32.775 --> 21:34.517
-I think he was trying
to stave off a mutiny.
-Hmm.

21:34.535 --> 21:37.586
Nothing else is gonna fit
in this freezer.

21:39.448 --> 21:41.257
(sighs)

21:43.694 --> 21:45.786
Uh, how would you feel

21:45.805 --> 21:47.696
about ice cream for dinner?

21:47.790 --> 21:51.050
As long as it doesn't taste
or smell like mackerel, I'm in.

21:51.202 --> 21:52.384
They've been in there
a really long time.

21:52.537 --> 21:53.702
You think
I should check on them?

21:53.721 --> 21:54.979
Uh, no, you should not.

21:55.130 --> 21:57.481
Yeah, I should go check.

21:58.876 --> 22:01.152
Hey. Everything good?

22:01.379 --> 22:03.487
Yeah. I changed her,
fed her, put her down.

22:03.639 --> 22:06.065
-You should be good
till morning.
-Great.

22:06.159 --> 22:09.118
Did, uh, she have her bath?

22:09.978 --> 22:11.403
Uh... no.

22:11.556 --> 22:13.998
No, she didn't
really get dirty today,

22:14.149 --> 22:16.167
so I didn't think...
I'm sure she's fine.

22:16.318 --> 22:19.244
Right. I-I'm sure she is, too.
I-I didn't mean...

22:19.397 --> 22:21.080
It's okay.
You know what, I should go.

22:21.215 --> 22:22.656
'Cause I have an apartment
to see tonight, so...

22:22.750 --> 22:24.842
Uh, sure you don't want
to stay for dinner?

22:24.993 --> 22:26.827
We're having
mint chocolate chip.

22:26.921 --> 22:27.828
No, thanks.

22:27.922 --> 22:30.514
You guys have a good night.

22:30.741 --> 22:33.017
(door closes)

22:35.930 --> 22:38.430
We should have
20 forks at this point.

22:38.583 --> 22:39.506
Why can't I find one?

22:39.525 --> 22:41.675
Uh, maybe they're
in the dishwasher.

22:41.802 --> 22:45.571
Just tell me there are
chopsticks in that bag.

22:49.184 --> 22:51.777
Taylor, um...

22:51.929 --> 22:53.996
Mm-hmm?

23:00.454 --> 23:02.938
I kissed someone.

23:02.957 --> 23:05.699
Wh-What?

23:05.718 --> 23:08.110
I kissed another woman.

23:08.129 --> 23:11.130
I mean, she kissed me,
but I-I-I kissed her back.

23:11.949 --> 23:15.451
And then, uh, I realized what
a mistake I was making, and...

23:15.544 --> 23:18.044
I stopped.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.805
Look, I-I'm really sorry.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.232
Oh.

23:21.383 --> 23:24.068
I'm really, really sorry.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.737
It didn't mean anything.

23:26.847 --> 23:29.698
I was drunk and-and stupid.

23:31.560 --> 23:33.202
When?

23:34.062 --> 23:35.471
When what?

23:35.564 --> 23:38.140
When were you drunk

23:38.159 --> 23:40.501
and stupid?

23:41.996 --> 23:44.237
A few weeks ago.

23:44.257 --> 23:47.073
We had that big save
on the freeway, and...

23:47.093 --> 23:48.592
and we went out to celebrate.

23:48.819 --> 23:54.173
That... hmm, that is a day
before you asked me to move in.

23:54.325 --> 23:57.768
Was that why
you asked me to move in?

23:57.995 --> 23:58.844
No.

23:58.996 --> 24:01.105
Hmm?

24:01.999 --> 24:04.024
Not-not entirely.

24:04.944 --> 24:07.528
"Not entirely."

24:08.597 --> 24:10.698
(scoffing):
Oh. Oh.

24:12.193 --> 24:14.526
Um, hey, wh-where are you going?

24:14.679 --> 24:16.937
Oh, I have no idea.

24:17.031 --> 24:19.790
-Are you gonna come back?
-Of course.

24:20.017 --> 24:23.127
I don't have
anywhere else to go.

24:24.279 --> 24:26.947
You made sure of that.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.466
(door slams)

24:36.959 --> 24:38.934
TRAVIS:
Give me your purse.

24:39.870 --> 24:41.887
-What?
-Give me your purse!

24:42.039 --> 24:43.872
Now!

24:43.891 --> 24:45.691
No.

24:46.560 --> 24:48.060
Are you not seeing this?

24:48.154 --> 24:50.546
How can I not when you're
waving it around like that?

24:50.564 --> 24:52.305
You want it?

24:52.325 --> 24:53.382
You're gonna have to come
and get it,

24:53.475 --> 24:54.658
'cause I'm not giving it to you.

24:54.885 --> 24:57.161
Lady, I swear I will shoot you.

24:57.312 --> 24:58.645
Are you sure about that?

24:58.739 --> 25:02.224
Feels like the window's closing
on that opportunity.

25:02.243 --> 25:03.559
You got some kind
of death wish?!

25:03.577 --> 25:06.337
(laughing)

25:06.564 --> 25:08.747
Let's find out.

25:08.899 --> 25:11.233
(shouting)

25:11.252 --> 25:13.736
You wanted me to be scared?

25:13.754 --> 25:15.996
(coughing, spitting)

25:16.090 --> 25:18.265
I ain't scared.

25:22.004 --> 25:23.579
Nope.

25:23.597 --> 25:26.190
Still not scared.

25:26.341 --> 25:28.267
Are you?

25:28.419 --> 25:30.736
No, this is not that difficult.
I...

25:33.107 --> 25:34.940
-PAULINE: You scared yet?
-RUTH: Ma'am!

25:35.092 --> 25:36.775
Ma'am.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.594
I-I don't know
what this man has done,

25:38.612 --> 25:40.612
but I can pretty much
make a guess.

25:40.765 --> 25:42.188
He thought he could scare me.

25:42.208 --> 25:43.782
Clearly, he misjudged you.

25:43.934 --> 25:44.875
But, please,

25:45.027 --> 25:47.286
don't take me
and this entire block

25:47.438 --> 25:49.362
with you to prove a point.

25:49.382 --> 25:52.258
(sirens wailing in distance)

25:58.966 --> 26:01.875
That's what I thought.
(grunts)

26:02.636 --> 26:05.120
-(Travis groans, grunts)
-I'm sorry.

26:05.213 --> 26:07.523
(car door opens, closes)

26:09.627 --> 26:11.977
Crazy bitch.

26:12.129 --> 26:13.654
(yells)

26:29.404 --> 26:31.130
(whooping)

26:33.000 --> 26:34.149
Hey!

26:34.242 --> 26:35.759
You got the wrong guy!

26:35.911 --> 26:37.577
I was just asking
for directions!

26:37.597 --> 26:39.412
-(grunts)
-Ruth.

26:39.432 --> 26:41.081
What's with the cold shower?

26:41.175 --> 26:42.766
You caught yourself
another Peeping Tom?

26:42.993 --> 26:45.085
-More creep than peep.
-(whoops)

26:45.104 --> 26:47.754
He was trying to rob
one of my customers at the pump.

26:47.848 --> 26:51.257
She retaliated by dousing him
with about $12 worth of premium,

26:51.385 --> 26:53.685
then turned the nozzle
on herself.

26:53.779 --> 26:55.671
High-octane baptism.

26:55.689 --> 26:58.657
-Now, that's a new one.
-(Travis groaning)

27:01.528 --> 27:03.269
Well, the mystery

27:03.364 --> 27:05.438
of the nice man
who asked for directions

27:05.532 --> 27:07.166
has been solved.

27:08.443 --> 27:10.628
Did she say something to you?

27:10.855 --> 27:13.464
Craziest thing. She apologized.

27:14.634 --> 27:16.925
Reckless and remorseful.

27:17.637 --> 27:20.379
Wonder what that's about.

27:20.531 --> 27:22.181
(siren wails)

27:26.871 --> 27:28.871
(whispers):
Oh, God.

27:28.964 --> 27:30.706
Oh, God. Did something happen?

27:30.799 --> 27:32.816
-Is Pauline okay?
-Pauline Barrett?

27:32.968 --> 27:34.376
My sister. We live together.

27:34.395 --> 27:36.712
-I-I'm Leticia.
-Sergeant Grant.

27:36.730 --> 27:38.380
So, you don't know where she is?

27:38.473 --> 27:39.973
She's not answering my calls
or texts.

27:39.992 --> 27:41.900
W-Was she
in some kind of accident?

27:41.994 --> 27:44.644
There was an incident
at a gas station.

27:44.664 --> 27:47.906
Oh. That's why she smelled
like gasoline.

27:48.058 --> 27:50.334
She blew through here,
took a shower,

27:50.485 --> 27:51.502
then left again.

27:51.653 --> 27:52.711
She wouldn't talk to me.

27:52.863 --> 27:55.172
She's just not herself lately.

27:55.323 --> 27:57.323
-In what way?
-(sighs)

27:57.418 --> 27:58.491
She's irritable.

27:58.511 --> 27:59.993
Easy to set off.

28:00.087 --> 28:02.070
Last week,
we were at a grocery store.

28:02.089 --> 28:03.922
Some guy was ahead of us
in the express lane,

28:04.074 --> 28:06.016
and he had
way more than 15 items.

28:06.168 --> 28:07.743
He probably had
15 bottles of wine alone.

28:07.761 --> 28:10.412
He counts those as one item.
I know the creature.

28:10.505 --> 28:12.764
-What happened?
-Pauline told him

28:12.917 --> 28:14.674
to move to another line.
He wouldn't.

28:14.768 --> 28:17.194
They started arguing,
and Pauline just snapped.

28:17.421 --> 28:20.531
Grabbed the bottles of wine
and smashed them at his feet.

28:20.682 --> 28:23.367
And this guy was big.
He was getting in her face

28:23.518 --> 28:25.035
and leaning over her,
and she didn't even blink.

28:25.187 --> 28:28.539
And there haven't been
any other changes in her life?

28:28.766 --> 28:31.191
(sighs) Just her voice.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.526
Uh, I noticed it
a few weeks ago.

28:33.620 --> 28:36.788
She started to sound
raspy and hoarse.

28:36.941 --> 28:39.107
Please, you have to find her.

28:39.201 --> 28:41.626
I don't know what's happening
with my sister,

28:41.779 --> 28:44.054
but she's not okay.

28:47.284 --> 28:48.617

28:48.635 --> 28:50.619

-Can you get an airbag

-Negative. Too much obstruction.

29:53.275 --> 29:56.034
Okay. You're... fearless.

29:56.128 --> 29:59.612
When you say it like that,
it sounds like a good thing.

29:59.632 --> 30:01.540
I mean, who'd want to be afraid?

30:01.692 --> 30:04.301
<i> Uh, not many people.</i>

30:19.543 --> 30:20.967
who almost set herself on fire?

the ability to be afraid.

Gasoline wouldn't do that.

30:58.415 --> 31:00.840

42:57.650 --> 42:58.908

42:59.135 --> 43:00.910

43:01.062 --> 43:02.996
Okay.

43:04.416 --> 43:08.710
Okay. Well,
what are you afraid of?

43:13.499 --> 43:17.010
That I'm never gonna
feel normal again.
