08:42.388 --> 08:44.490
Six to eleven-year-olds are one
of our most prized demographics.

08:44.557 --> 08:46.125
- What brought you guys
to the Wayne anyway?

08:46.192 --> 08:47.126
- Hello?

08:47.193 --> 08:49.862
Crazy light show
on your roof last week.

08:49.929 --> 08:52.465
- Saraline!
She saw Andre use his powers.

08:52.531 --> 08:53.766
Maybe she's not a Norma.

08:53.833 --> 08:55.301
- Ansi, that doesn't
prove anything.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.870
As long as she's at the Wayne,
she could still be in danger.

08:57.937 --> 09:00.273
Plus, she and her dad
are complete dunce nuggets.

09:00.339 --> 09:01.540

it's the old 2XL model.

course-correcting hover.

09:08.614 --> 09:10.750

modified it to my specs.

Sorry, that was hashtag so 2015.

09:15.922 --> 09:16.856

she's a dunce nugget? Ow!

09:19.392 --> 09:20.726

09:20.793 --> 09:23.496
I knew there was something
worth exploring down here.

really onto something.

09:36.208 --> 09:38.878
- Listen, Olly, I'm only
gonna say this once.

09:38.945 --> 09:41.814
We can't let Garrison
see anything crazy.

what I'm saying?

09:43.582 --> 09:45.318
- Yep. Nope.

09:45.384 --> 09:46.585
Sort of a yope.

- Olly, I'm asking
for your help one last time.

09:50.323 --> 09:51.991

your drones

10:15.781 --> 10:17.283
