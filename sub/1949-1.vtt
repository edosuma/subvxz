00:27.894 --> 00:31.463
I remember that day
as if it was yesterday.

00:33.601 --> 00:36.068
It was a peaceful spring...

00:36.070 --> 00:37.950
here in the south of our empire.

00:39.205 --> 00:41.907
The first World War
was already raging

00:41.909 --> 00:44.243
for almost a year now...

00:44.245 --> 00:47.079
hundreds of miles away
in the east.

00:47.081 --> 00:50.249
But people were
already talking about war,

00:50.251 --> 00:52.151
even in our mountains.

00:52.153 --> 00:54.720
That's when I had this dream.

00:54.722 --> 00:58.223
Every night... the same dream.

01:02.228 --> 01:04.229
I was on top of our mountain...

01:07.167 --> 01:10.569
opposite an Italian soldier,
a <i> wolch.</i>

01:15.108 --> 01:17.109
Suddenly, the <i> wolch</i> ran at me...

01:18.711 --> 01:20.112
as I pull out my rifle.

01:24.517 --> 01:26.557
Back then, I wasn't
baffled by the dream.

01:28.421 --> 01:30.689
I couldn't wait to join the war

01:30.691 --> 01:33.292
and finally get away from home,

01:33.294 --> 01:35.928
fight for our country...

01:35.930 --> 01:37.429
against the traitors.

01:39.532 --> 01:42.201
But then, the soldier
caught up again.

01:42.203 --> 01:44.536
He was still alive.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.538
Now, it was on me
to finish him up.

01:48.908 --> 01:51.510
But when I touched the trigger,

01:51.512 --> 01:54.179
I saw that he wasn't
carrying a rifle.

02:05.458 --> 02:07.559
Take it in your hand.

02:07.561 --> 02:08.727
It's your fault.

02:08.729 --> 02:11.129
No, it's not.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.200
Is the fuse out, Ander?

02:23.510 --> 02:25.244
Uh-uh-uh.
It's a dud, right?

02:25.246 --> 02:26.745
It's a dud?

02:29.349 --> 02:31.350
Lechner, you moron.

02:31.352 --> 02:32.352
What did I do?

02:32.353 --> 02:34.086
You let it get wet.

02:34.088 --> 02:35.721
Oh!
Hey, leave him alone.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.756
It didn't get wet.

02:38.759 --> 02:39.759
Ah!

02:39.760 --> 02:40.760
Whoa!

02:45.933 --> 02:47.773
Help!
Lechner can't swim.

02:50.938 --> 02:51.938
Help!

02:54.874 --> 02:55.874
Come on!

03:05.985 --> 03:08.754
Thank you.

03:15.628 --> 03:16.695
Ander?

03:18.331 --> 03:19.891
Ander!

03:19.915 --> 03:20.899
Ander.

03:20.901 --> 03:23.936
Have you lost your mind, huh?

03:23.938 --> 03:26.938
Leaving mass...
your sister's getting married.
To a <i> wolch!</i>

03:26.940 --> 03:29.340
I don't want anything
to do with <i> wolch!</i>

03:29.364 --> 03:31.910
<i>Wolch?</i>
Italians are our family.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.192
Not mine.

03:43.256 --> 03:45.256
The folks in our village
were outraged

03:45.280 --> 03:48.393
that my father married off
my sister Lisl to a <i> wolch.</i>

03:48.395 --> 03:50.963
Most of us hated the Italians,
but now everybody

03:50.965 --> 03:53.665
was celebrating together
as if they were best friends,

03:53.667 --> 03:55.434
just like my father predicted.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.069
One more stunt like this today,

03:57.071 --> 03:59.071
and I'm gonna let you have it.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.445
Your father will calm down soon.

04:14.188 --> 04:17.422
I had never seen
my sister Lisl so happy,

04:17.423 --> 04:20.425
there with her new husband,
Angelo Calzolari.

04:35.141 --> 04:38.176
When I was four years old,
my father built this hotel.

04:38.178 --> 04:39.811
It was an instant success.

04:41.648 --> 04:44.483
People came from all parts
of the world,

04:44.485 --> 04:46.985
but I hardly ever
saw my father again.

04:52.458 --> 04:55.127
The more foreigners,
the more reputation

04:55.129 --> 04:56.662
and prestige for my father.

05:05.471 --> 05:08.974
Now, it was time for my father's
most ambitious project ever,

05:08.976 --> 05:11.056
the first mountain
tramway in our valley.

05:16.816 --> 05:19.651
And how convenient
that Lisl's new husband Angelo

05:19.653 --> 05:23.155
was the engineer he needed
to compliment his dream.

05:24.757 --> 05:26.325
We did it, Angelo.

05:26.327 --> 05:28.827
Your father has big plans.

05:30.630 --> 05:33.665
Want some?

05:33.667 --> 05:35.707
I knew that my teacher
was secretly in love

05:35.731 --> 05:38.270
with my sister Lisl,
and it didn't make things easier

05:38.272 --> 05:40.105
that her husband was Italian.

05:40.107 --> 05:41.947
He hated them more than anyone.

05:48.614 --> 05:50.782
But your time will come.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.064
You will see, Ander.

05:53.519 --> 05:55.020
Times are changing.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.224
I can feel it.

05:59.226 --> 06:02.427
And then, your father
will be proud of you.

06:02.429 --> 06:04.963
He will see
what you are made of.

06:04.965 --> 06:06.465
Hm?

06:39.466 --> 06:42.234
I see you do fancy her.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.104
She's stunning,
your new sister-in-law.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.386
She's a <i> wolch.</i>

06:48.941 --> 06:52.444
My grandfather was also
Italian, from Piedmont.

06:54.046 --> 06:56.848
Blimey, so you care
less of me now?

07:15.535 --> 07:18.036
Mm-hmm, not enough at all.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.318
Mm.

07:30.550 --> 07:32.017
May I cut in?

07:55.775 --> 07:58.243
So you do like the <i> wolch,</i> huh?

08:49.729 --> 08:50.729
Mm.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.726
Francesca.

09:51.390 --> 09:52.390
Excuse me.

09:56.062 --> 09:57.062
Are you all right?

10:13.647 --> 10:15.947
<i>No... no... no partire?</i>

10:17.231 --> 10:18.511
<i>Si.</i>

10:18.535 --> 10:20.218
<i>No partire.</i>

10:20.220 --> 10:22.654
No... you are...

10:22.656 --> 10:25.190
<i>no partire,</i> you... you...
you don't want to leave?

10:25.192 --> 10:26.725
<i>Si.</i>

10:26.727 --> 10:28.059
No go.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.561
<i>No partire.</i>

10:33.200 --> 10:35.500
Well, um...

10:35.502 --> 10:36.568
then, no partire.

10:36.570 --> 10:39.070
Then... then...
then, don't leave.

10:48.914 --> 10:50.382
Ander?

10:50.384 --> 10:51.883
They are looking for you.

10:51.885 --> 10:54.019
For the family picture.

10:54.021 --> 10:56.354
Ander!

10:56.356 --> 10:57.856
What are you waiting for?

10:59.959 --> 11:02.394
And now, quiet, please.

11:02.396 --> 11:03.676
<i>Silencio.</i>

11:05.131 --> 11:06.411
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

11:09.602 --> 11:10.935
<i>Attenzione!</i>

11:10.937 --> 11:12.437
Don't move!

11:20.546 --> 11:23.415
The Italians declared war
on Austria.

11:28.689 --> 11:33.024
War, right here
in our mountains.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.393
The news instantly turned
our two families...

11:36.896 --> 11:37.896
into enemies.

11:49.575 --> 11:50.855
We are cleaning up now.

11:50.879 --> 11:52.979
No, another half an hour...
half an hour.

12:12.665 --> 12:14.499
Here, here! Follow me.

12:14.501 --> 12:15.800
Quickly!

12:25.845 --> 12:27.645
You have to hurry up now.

12:30.216 --> 12:32.317
Angelo, take care of yourself.

12:32.319 --> 12:33.618
I'll see you very soon.

12:35.688 --> 12:38.449
Francesca's in the last car,
I just brought her her suitcase.

12:39.692 --> 12:41.826
Come on, let's go!<i> Avanti!</i>

12:41.828 --> 12:43.828
You come back... promise?

12:52.037 --> 12:53.037
See you soon.

13:02.548 --> 13:04.983
It's a bit cold, but it...
it... it'll be fine.

13:06.485 --> 13:08.953
Don't, um...
turn on the light

13:08.955 --> 13:11.022
without covering the window...
the windows.

13:14.093 --> 13:16.533
Well, the local riflemen
head to the front tomorrow.

13:16.557 --> 13:18.056
That includes me.

13:19.064 --> 13:21.032
They are... we will...

13:21.034 --> 13:23.201
we will wait there
until the Kaiserjãger arrive.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.603
They're in the eastern Russia,
but they'll get here soon,

13:25.627 --> 13:28.628
and then we'll definitely
win... win the war.

13:30.242 --> 13:32.043
The Kaiserjãger,
they are the strongest

13:32.045 --> 13:33.845
mountain corps in the world.

13:33.847 --> 13:37.215
I was reading a... a very, very
interesting book, actually,

13:37.217 --> 13:41.152
about the... uh, yeah.

13:43.022 --> 13:44.656
We'll probably be cold at first,

13:44.658 --> 13:47.225
but, um, there are other
blankets underneath here.

13:47.227 --> 13:51.996
And... and... and... and if you
are... are hungry, then, um...

14:35.374 --> 14:37.475
These bastards.

14:37.477 --> 14:38.610
It's true.

14:38.612 --> 14:40.979
Bastards are
hunting the Italians.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.781
Tell them to stop.

14:44.850 --> 14:46.251
Where to?

14:46.253 --> 14:47.819
We are on our way to Riva.

14:47.821 --> 14:49.220
No Riva for you...
get out now.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.582
Where do you think you're going?

14:51.584 --> 14:54.104
Go on, get back behind the wire.

14:54.128 --> 14:54.559
Hey!

14:54.561 --> 14:56.060
Hey.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.010
Stop him!

14:59.012 --> 15:00.292
Hey, get him!

15:00.316 --> 15:02.269
This is our chance...
let's go.

15:08.707 --> 15:11.976
Stop! Halt! I'll shoot!

15:42.808 --> 15:44.542
<i>Si.</i>

15:44.544 --> 15:46.104
Milano?
Mm-hmm.

15:48.714 --> 15:50.882
No.

15:50.884 --> 15:54.285
I... I can't go to Italy.

15:54.287 --> 15:58.890
<i>Italia partire me no.</i>

16:00.293 --> 16:02.894
<i>Nueva York.</i>

16:02.896 --> 16:04.395
In America.

16:06.932 --> 16:09.067
America?
In America,<i> si.</i>

16:12.672 --> 16:14.672
Hm?

16:17.476 --> 16:18.756
Yeah.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.646
I'll go to New York.

16:25.518 --> 16:28.820
When?

16:28.822 --> 16:30.154
I don't know.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.990
No.

16:31.992 --> 16:34.058
Soon.

16:37.364 --> 16:38.529
New York.

16:40.032 --> 16:42.433
Yeah.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.435
We will go.

16:46.505 --> 16:48.106
America.

16:49.675 --> 16:50.875
We'll go to America.

17:15.166 --> 17:17.135
Let's move! Hurry!

17:23.142 --> 17:24.142
Let me through.

17:40.225 --> 17:43.227
Everybody! Attention!

17:48.700 --> 17:51.736
Every Tyrolean has the right
and the responsibility

17:51.738 --> 17:54.572
to defend his country.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.507
In this hour...

17:56.509 --> 17:59.610
as Italy has betrayed our Kaiser

17:59.612 --> 18:02.613
and maliciously declared war
on our homeland...

18:04.850 --> 18:08.653
it is you who are
the last line of defense

18:08.655 --> 18:11.456
for our families and soil.

18:11.458 --> 18:15.293
The Kaiser expects unconditional
fulfillment of your duties.

18:27.739 --> 18:30.308
Ten hut! Fire!

18:34.413 --> 18:38.449
What's going on out there?

18:38.451 --> 18:41.319
I solemnly swear by God
the almighty.

18:41.321 --> 18:43.721
A pure and sincere vow.

18:43.745 --> 18:45.623
A pure and sincere vow.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.959
Oh, my God.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.460
Oh, my God, I overslept.

18:49.462 --> 18:52.730
To fight the enemy
courageously and stoutly.

18:52.732 --> 18:55.500
To preserve and protect
our ordnance.

18:55.502 --> 18:58.136
To preserve and protect
our ordnance.

18:58.138 --> 19:01.539
And to always stand
by our flags.

19:01.541 --> 19:04.375
And to always stand
by our flags.

19:04.377 --> 19:07.645
The same as any brave soldier
would for his country.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.848
The same as any brave soldier
would do for his country.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.414
This is the biggest firework
that exists.

19:43.416 --> 19:44.749
The Red Eagle.

19:46.285 --> 19:50.221
If you're in danger,
you have a...

19:50.223 --> 19:53.224
a <i> problema...</i>
you have a <i> problema...</i>

19:59.098 --> 20:01.065
You light the fuse.

20:01.067 --> 20:03.467
You understand?
You light the fuse.

20:05.971 --> 20:08.639
It'll go up in the air.

20:08.641 --> 20:11.909
And I'll see it,
up there in the mountains.

20:13.679 --> 20:16.480
And I'll come down...

20:16.482 --> 20:19.083
and I'll help you.

20:19.085 --> 20:21.586
You understand?

20:21.588 --> 20:23.254
<i>Capito?</i>

20:23.256 --> 20:24.976
Fire!

20:26.059 --> 20:28.593
Fall out!

20:32.298 --> 20:35.299
Rifleman Gruber
reporting for duty, sir.

20:37.369 --> 20:38.836
Close ranks.

20:45.277 --> 20:46.777
Look after yourself.

20:49.715 --> 20:51.955
It's good, I'll be all right.

20:53.352 --> 20:54.852
I love you.

20:54.854 --> 20:59.190
Everybody, attention!

20:59.192 --> 21:02.526
Right face!

21:02.528 --> 21:04.595
Company, march!

21:32.991 --> 21:34.792
Hey,<i> alpini.</i>

21:34.794 --> 21:36.160
What is it?

21:36.162 --> 21:37.361
Oh,<i> alpini.</i>

21:37.363 --> 21:40.798
<i>Alpini! Alpini! Alpini!</i>

21:40.800 --> 21:43.134
Are you out of your mind?

21:43.136 --> 21:44.368
Quiet down, for Christ's sake.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.599
What's going on?
I was just taking a leak,

21:48.623 --> 21:49.907
and this idiot
almost shot at me.

21:49.909 --> 21:51.976
Ander said they were <i> alpini.</i>

21:51.978 --> 21:54.138
Don't worry, you'll stop
laughing soon enough.

21:56.481 --> 21:57.761
Where would the <i> alpini</i> come from

21:57.785 --> 22:00.751
on this side
of the mountain, huh?

22:00.753 --> 22:03.187
Get back in line.

22:03.189 --> 22:05.589
I don't want
the first one to die

22:05.591 --> 22:06.724
before the war even starts.

22:36.655 --> 22:38.122
Let's go.

23:22.334 --> 23:24.769
Are you frightened?

23:24.771 --> 23:26.337
You?

23:26.339 --> 23:27.838
Eh.

23:29.408 --> 23:32.943
When you go to war,
you always have two choices.

23:32.945 --> 23:34.812
You could get caught
with your pants down,

23:34.814 --> 23:37.248
or up and ready to go.

23:37.250 --> 23:40.017
If it doesn't catch you,
good for you.

23:40.019 --> 23:43.020
If the worst thing happens,
you still have two choices.

23:44.756 --> 23:47.191
You either survive, or you die.

23:47.193 --> 23:48.793
If you survive, that's great.

23:48.795 --> 23:51.529
But if you happen to die...

23:53.633 --> 23:56.033
You have two options again.

23:56.035 --> 23:58.135
You'll either end up alone
in a single grave

23:58.137 --> 23:59.203
or in a mass grave.

23:59.205 --> 24:00.471
Let's move!
And...

24:00.473 --> 24:02.106
Hurry!

24:02.108 --> 24:03.388
What happens?

24:03.412 --> 24:04.809
Come on.

24:04.811 --> 24:06.310
What can happen?

25:18.850 --> 25:23.120
Savoya! Savoya! Savoya! Savoya!

25:31.630 --> 25:34.298
It's not easy for you,
Gruber, huh?

25:34.300 --> 25:35.799
What do you mean?

25:37.069 --> 25:39.870
Fighting against
your own family.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.706
What is it, teacher?

25:42.708 --> 25:44.375
Are you still having a hard time

25:44.377 --> 25:46.697
because I wouldn't give you
Lisl to be your wife?

25:46.721 --> 25:48.279
Come on.

25:48.281 --> 25:51.282
My daughter needed
a man, a real man.

25:55.186 --> 25:56.620
Men!

25:56.622 --> 25:59.256
Out there, under that rock,
we make camp.

26:22.380 --> 26:24.780
Holy crap.

26:26.017 --> 26:27.518
Look at them.

26:27.520 --> 26:29.019
There are so many.

26:48.707 --> 26:51.775
About 200 or 300
are sitting down there.

26:51.777 --> 26:54.678
Well, it's a hundred times
more men than we have.

26:54.680 --> 26:56.714
Ten.

26:56.716 --> 27:00.017
The <i> alpini</i> are better equipped
and better trained than we are.

27:00.019 --> 27:02.519
When do the Germans join us?

27:02.521 --> 27:04.521
We can't wait for them.

27:07.492 --> 27:09.793
But God is on our side.

27:09.795 --> 27:12.796
All right, then, tell him
to get us some more ammunition.

27:18.570 --> 27:20.170
We can put more fires up.

28:05.950 --> 28:07.618
Hurry!

28:07.620 --> 28:09.219
Come on!

28:09.221 --> 28:10.721
Hurry!

28:24.636 --> 28:26.937
It's about time.

28:26.939 --> 28:29.440
Let's unpack... quick!

28:56.234 --> 28:58.914
Those first few days
of the war

28:58.938 --> 29:00.838
were like one big adventure.

29:01.706 --> 29:03.774
We knew our mountain
so much better

29:03.776 --> 29:05.476
than the attacking Italians.

29:08.113 --> 29:11.315
We made the <i> wolch</i> believe
we were big battalions

29:11.317 --> 29:13.851
instead of tiny platoons...

29:13.853 --> 29:16.487
and the Italians retreated.

29:39.444 --> 29:41.324
What's the matter, huh, Gruber?

29:43.748 --> 29:45.868
He misses his old Gruber lady.

29:52.957 --> 29:55.397
That's not funny
at all, you morons.

29:56.828 --> 29:58.908
This war has only just begun.

30:00.366 --> 30:01.832
Come on, give it up.

30:01.834 --> 30:04.334
Let Kofler play that box.

30:05.871 --> 30:06.871
Yeah!

30:36.134 --> 30:37.601
Today, we really showed them.

30:42.040 --> 30:43.841
How long do you think
this war will last?

30:43.843 --> 30:45.209
Don't worry.

30:45.211 --> 30:47.451
You will get
to shoot some <i> wolch.</i>

30:51.649 --> 30:54.284
Someone's coming!

30:56.020 --> 30:57.221
Nobody shoot!

30:57.223 --> 30:58.622
Those aren't <i> alpini!</i>

31:14.906 --> 31:16.707
First lieutenant Sven Kornatz,

31:16.709 --> 31:20.043
Bavarian Jãger Battalion One
of the German Mountain Infantry.

31:20.045 --> 31:21.378
Captain Karl Gruber,

31:21.380 --> 31:24.114
Imperial and Royal
Infantry Battalion Sexton.

31:24.116 --> 31:26.116
We were waiting for you.

32:04.956 --> 32:06.436
Hey!

32:06.460 --> 32:07.958
Come on, you lazy bastards!

32:07.960 --> 32:10.160
Everybody pull!

32:10.162 --> 32:11.428
Pull!

32:11.430 --> 32:13.530
Put your backs into it!

32:13.532 --> 32:15.032
Come on, move it!

32:31.149 --> 32:32.816
Brand-new equipment.

32:32.818 --> 32:34.518
We just got it.

32:34.520 --> 32:37.054
Modern times.

32:37.056 --> 32:39.690
They'll see these
all the way to Bruneck.

32:39.692 --> 32:41.658
10,000 watt.

32:41.660 --> 32:42.940
But how?

32:42.964 --> 32:44.431
Generators.

32:47.732 --> 32:51.001
Gruber, is the line still dead?

32:51.003 --> 32:55.238
I want to have a line today.

32:55.240 --> 32:56.573
A telephone?

32:56.575 --> 32:59.142
In the mountains?

32:59.144 --> 33:01.584
We have everything
to win the war.

33:01.608 --> 33:03.714
Ander!

33:03.716 --> 33:05.182
Time to change guards.

33:05.184 --> 33:06.683
Hurry.

33:14.125 --> 33:15.405
Huh?

33:15.429 --> 33:17.728
Ah.

33:20.465 --> 33:21.932
I'm supposed to relieve you.

33:23.534 --> 33:24.534
Good.

33:27.338 --> 33:30.173
So what happens
when you go to war?

33:31.976 --> 33:33.510
Where were we?

33:33.512 --> 33:36.346
Uh, the mass grave.

33:36.348 --> 33:37.781
Mass grave, that's right.

33:39.284 --> 33:43.620
Well, you either end up
on top of the pile

33:43.622 --> 33:46.056
or somewhere underneath.

33:46.058 --> 33:49.126
If you're on top,
well, then good for you.

33:49.128 --> 33:50.894
But if you find
you're underneath,

33:50.896 --> 33:53.430
you'll be left with two choices.

33:53.432 --> 33:56.800
Either you remain
just as you are,

33:56.802 --> 33:59.970
or you become a tree.

33:59.972 --> 34:02.806
If you do stay as you are,
well, good for you.

34:02.808 --> 34:05.242
But if you become a tree,

34:05.244 --> 34:07.644
you've got two choices again

34:07.646 --> 34:10.313
because you either turn
into a leaf tree

34:10.315 --> 34:12.215
or a cone tree of some kind.

34:12.217 --> 34:15.485
If you turn into a leaf tree,
well, then good for you.

34:16.722 --> 34:19.255
But if it's a cone tree
you become,

34:19.257 --> 34:22.759
you'll find yourself
facing two options again.

34:22.761 --> 34:27.664
You either grow and become
a lovely piece of wood,

34:27.666 --> 34:29.733
or you're stunted and you get...

34:31.303 --> 34:34.771
If you grow and turn into
a piece of wood, good for you.

34:34.773 --> 34:36.940
But of course,
if you're cut down,

34:36.942 --> 34:39.476
you'll find there's
still two choices.

34:39.478 --> 34:42.179
You'll find you either
end up in a sawmill

34:42.181 --> 34:44.748
or possibly in a paper mill.

34:44.750 --> 34:47.984
If you find you're in
a saw mill, then good for you.

34:47.985 --> 34:50.454
But if you end up
in a paper mill,

34:50.456 --> 34:53.123
you'll find
you have two choices again.

34:53.125 --> 34:56.426
You'll eventually turn into
either writing paper

34:56.428 --> 34:59.329
or possibly toilet paper.

34:59.331 --> 35:01.965
If you become writing paper,
good for you.

35:01.967 --> 35:04.367
But if you turn
into toilet paper,

35:04.369 --> 35:08.271
you'll end up having
your head in someone's ass.

38:54.198 --> 38:55.665
That's our village.

38:55.667 --> 38:58.401
What are we waiting for?
We have to help them!

38:58.403 --> 38:59.836
They are shelling the hotel.

38:59.838 --> 39:02.272
And what are you guys
gonna do about it?

39:02.274 --> 39:04.240
Sir, if we run down now,

39:04.242 --> 39:05.742
we'll be back by the morning.

39:07.345 --> 39:10.013
You want to be
court martial-ed?

39:10.015 --> 39:11.614
We are at war!

39:11.616 --> 39:13.750
Get used to it.

39:13.752 --> 39:15.251
Good night.

39:58.496 --> 40:00.964
The Italians will try
to get up here.

40:00.966 --> 40:02.732
If so, they will try to come

40:02.734 --> 40:04.467
over the east or the south face.

40:06.370 --> 40:08.772
Before we enforce our position
on the plateau,

40:08.774 --> 40:10.607
we have to secure
the south face.

40:10.609 --> 40:11.889
Nonsense.

40:14.345 --> 40:16.626
You can't see this on the map,

40:16.650 --> 40:18.248
but the south face is steep.

40:18.250 --> 40:20.531
No one can make it up there.

40:20.533 --> 40:22.166
You can see a lot
of things on a map

40:22.168 --> 40:23.586
if you read it correctly.

40:23.588 --> 40:25.622
Are you saying
that I can't read maps?

40:25.624 --> 40:26.956
I'm saying that one battalion

40:26.958 --> 40:28.425
is heading
to the south face today!

40:39.403 --> 40:42.138
The teacher, ugh.

40:42.140 --> 40:44.474
What an idiot.

42:27.578 --> 42:29.058
It's coming from over there.

42:29.082 --> 42:30.446
By those rocks.

42:30.448 --> 42:32.649
To the right.

42:32.651 --> 42:33.783
There.

42:36.220 --> 42:38.254
Ibex.

42:38.256 --> 42:40.990
Don't shoot.

42:40.992 --> 42:42.158
<i>Alpini.</i>

42:43.694 --> 42:46.062
Shh.

42:46.064 --> 42:48.064
Come on, Ander,
this is ridiculous.

42:49.833 --> 42:51.301
It's coming from down there.

42:55.005 --> 42:56.739
It's a 100-meter drop.

42:56.741 --> 42:58.508
123.

42:58.510 --> 43:00.643
No one can climb up here,

43:00.645 --> 43:03.246
not even ibex.

43:11.388 --> 43:13.289
<i>Alpini.</i>

43:13.291 --> 43:15.491
Those bastards.

43:15.493 --> 43:16.693
I'll get my men.

43:16.695 --> 43:17.975
Don't.

43:19.263 --> 43:21.364
There's only the three of us.

43:21.366 --> 43:22.665
One is enough.

43:32.743 --> 43:34.711
Fire!

43:34.713 --> 43:35.993
Shoot them, shoot!

43:36.996 --> 43:39.282
Shoot it!

44:30.701 --> 44:33.703
The Italian soldier returned.

44:37.041 --> 44:40.043
He kept running,
and nothing would stop him.

45:05.002 --> 45:07.770
But now, I just couldn't
pull the trigger

45:07.772 --> 45:09.772
as he ran across
the battlefield.

45:13.010 --> 45:15.278
All I could do was wonder why

45:15.280 --> 45:18.281
the <i> wolch</i> carried
this teakettle.

47:39.957 --> 47:41.524
<i>Excusi.</i>

48:01.511 --> 48:03.151
Hey, stop it.

48:05.215 --> 48:07.283
It won't get me out of here.

48:07.285 --> 48:09.418
Apple pie, I made it.

48:09.420 --> 48:11.120
Stop talking,
someone could hear you!

48:11.122 --> 48:13.789
Sorry.
Stop!

48:13.791 --> 48:15.558
Pronunciation's really good.

48:15.560 --> 48:18.461
Get back...
back in the kitchen.

48:18.463 --> 48:20.129
Come on.

48:20.131 --> 48:21.297
What do you have here?

48:21.299 --> 48:23.332
Looks good.

48:23.334 --> 48:24.567
That's an apple?

48:24.569 --> 48:26.049
Mm-hmm.
Yeah?

48:27.938 --> 48:29.258
We will see
if he has temperature.

48:32.442 --> 48:34.922
Lisl!

48:35.412 --> 48:37.780
Go... what are
you doing here?

48:37.782 --> 48:41.083
What happened?
Ah, just a little
<i>alpini</i> attack.

48:41.085 --> 48:43.152
Who is she?

48:43.154 --> 48:45.855
A kitchen head from Hungary.

48:45.857 --> 48:48.024
How's my father?
And Ander?

48:48.026 --> 48:50.293
Here's a letter from him.

48:50.295 --> 48:52.528
Your father doing
all right... Ander too.

48:52.530 --> 48:54.797
And I have orders
to stay down here.

48:54.799 --> 48:56.265
Mother!

49:03.141 --> 49:04.861
Don't waste ammo!

49:06.377 --> 49:07.710
Shoot straight, lads!

50:34.164 --> 50:35.898
Lechner! Keep your tongue in!

50:36.967 --> 50:38.968
Lechner! Come on!

50:38.970 --> 50:41.637
Lechner, can you hear me?

50:41.639 --> 50:42.905
Damn it, Lechner.

50:42.907 --> 50:46.308
Open your eyes, open your eyes!

50:46.310 --> 50:48.144
Lechner, come on, boy.

50:48.146 --> 50:52.081
Stop it, he's gone.

52:07.892 --> 52:09.358
Francesca.

52:19.136 --> 52:21.670
What happened to you?

52:21.672 --> 52:24.540
Your mother
and your sister found me,

52:24.542 --> 52:26.041
and have been helping me.

52:30.580 --> 52:34.049
I thought you wouldn't
recognize me.

52:34.051 --> 52:35.584
You speak so well.

52:40.190 --> 52:42.224
You are a hero.

52:42.226 --> 52:43.726
Everyone says that.

52:46.763 --> 52:48.731
You saved your father's life.

52:53.103 --> 52:54.570
How long have I been here?

52:56.373 --> 52:58.440
Only...

52:58.442 --> 52:59.942
11... 11 days.

53:02.379 --> 53:03.659
Look.

53:28.505 --> 53:29.972
I love you.

53:36.214 --> 53:38.247
I love you too.

53:41.986 --> 53:44.453
Ander?

53:44.455 --> 53:47.256
You feeling better?

53:49.460 --> 53:50.726
You see, I told you.

53:50.728 --> 53:52.228
Your time will come.

53:54.731 --> 53:56.771
Everyone is talking about
how many <i> wolch</i>

53:56.795 --> 53:58.267
you killed out there.

53:58.269 --> 54:00.502
They say you shot one
right in the face.

54:05.409 --> 54:06.909
A real hero.

54:18.788 --> 54:20.289
A present for you.

54:22.259 --> 54:25.294
You have to rest so you can
return to the front soon.

54:25.296 --> 54:26.296
Hm.

55:49.646 --> 55:51.113
Beautiful folk songs.

55:53.149 --> 55:54.750
Come back after the war,

55:54.752 --> 55:57.953
and I'll show you a couple
of other things you'll like.

55:57.955 --> 55:59.455
After the war.

56:20.577 --> 56:22.077
What's the matter?

56:23.813 --> 56:24.913
It's moving.

56:29.185 --> 56:30.465
It could be a boy.

56:30.489 --> 56:31.621
You think so?

56:33.056 --> 56:36.458
Oh... not again.

56:36.460 --> 56:38.761
It'll go on in a second.

56:38.763 --> 56:40.295
I'll go and light a candle.

56:48.238 --> 56:50.758
What's Francesca
doing down there?

56:50.782 --> 56:52.515
I don't know.

56:53.443 --> 56:54.723
Someone will recognize her.

56:54.747 --> 56:55.944
I'll go get her.

56:55.946 --> 56:57.913
Yeah.

58:02.746 --> 58:05.914
Do you want to go
to the military command?

58:05.916 --> 58:08.217
You can choose.

58:08.219 --> 58:10.486
Either me...

58:10.488 --> 58:12.488
or an entire battalion.

58:46.155 --> 58:47.422
Ander!

58:47.424 --> 58:48.424
What are you doing?

58:48.425 --> 58:49.925
The lightning!

58:49.927 --> 58:53.762
Throw away your rifle, Ander,
the lightning!

58:53.764 --> 58:56.198
Ander!

58:56.200 --> 58:58.200
Drop your rifle, Ander!

01:00:07.904 --> 01:00:10.505
The finger...

01:00:10.507 --> 01:00:12.007
I bit off.

01:00:16.479 --> 01:00:18.480
He wouldn't let me go.

01:00:20.249 --> 01:00:22.150
Understand?

01:00:22.152 --> 01:00:24.886
He wouldn't let me go,
so I bit off his finger.

01:00:24.888 --> 01:00:27.389
Then I... swallowed it.

01:00:29.726 --> 01:00:32.494
I swallowed... his finger.

01:00:34.764 --> 01:00:36.832
His finger...

01:00:39.235 --> 01:00:40.702
I swallowed his finger.

01:04:12.448 --> 01:04:13.915
Ander.

01:04:16.552 --> 01:04:17.686
Son.

01:04:17.688 --> 01:04:19.354
Ander!

01:06:03.893 --> 01:06:06.253
Hello, Lisl.

01:06:06.929 --> 01:06:08.396
Hello.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.468
I wanted to see
how you were doing...

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:15.710
how the two of you are doing.

01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:18.006
Thank you.

01:06:19.508 --> 01:06:21.628
If there's something I can do...

01:06:25.581 --> 01:06:28.049
Times are tough...

01:06:28.051 --> 01:06:29.551
and we all have
to stick together.

01:06:36.926 --> 01:06:38.393
I want you to know...

01:06:39.962 --> 01:06:41.429
I'm here for you.

01:06:44.266 --> 01:06:45.734
And for the child, of course.

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:52.907
You need a husband.

01:06:54.443 --> 01:06:55.910
I have a husband.

01:07:00.983 --> 01:07:02.450
So you don't know?

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:05.520
What shall I know?

01:07:09.225 --> 01:07:10.225
Huh?

01:07:21.837 --> 01:07:23.304
Your husband.

01:07:29.211 --> 01:07:30.712
He's dead.

01:07:35.151 --> 01:07:36.618
That's not true.

01:07:46.562 --> 01:07:48.063
My deepest condolences.

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:53.101
We confiscated the list...

01:07:55.337 --> 01:07:57.305
with all the names
of the full Italians.

01:07:59.775 --> 01:08:01.843
I had a look.

01:08:01.845 --> 01:08:04.112
His name was listed.

01:08:04.114 --> 01:08:05.180
Calzolari, right?

01:08:07.416 --> 01:08:08.416
Angelo.

01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:14.689
I'm so sorry.

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:26.828
He'll be fine...

01:10:48.877 --> 01:10:50.845
In the mountains.

01:10:54.216 --> 01:10:55.216
What?

01:10:58.053 --> 01:11:00.521
They are in the mountain.

01:11:05.427 --> 01:11:06.928
Who is in the mountain?

01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:17.639
R... right...

01:11:17.641 --> 01:11:19.140
now.

01:11:30.552 --> 01:11:32.020
They are in the mountain.

01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:20.781
Mm.

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:40.448
Morphine, morphine.

01:13:40.450 --> 01:13:42.316
It will come soon,
it will come soon.

01:13:42.318 --> 01:13:45.019
I'm really sorry,
it will come soon.

01:13:45.021 --> 01:13:47.021
Yes.

01:14:06.875 --> 01:14:10.211
Congratulations for
the little boy.

01:14:10.213 --> 01:14:11.679
What's his name?

01:14:13.215 --> 01:14:14.495
Angelo.

01:14:22.224 --> 01:14:23.291
I'm worried about you.

01:14:26.395 --> 01:14:29.997
Your child needs a father,
you need a husband.

01:14:29.999 --> 01:14:33.534
What do you think will happen
when the boy is older?

01:14:33.536 --> 01:14:35.336
Without a husband?

01:14:35.338 --> 01:14:36.838
Go away.

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:40.341
And with that half-breed
of yours.

01:14:42.010 --> 01:14:44.979
Who will be running the hotel
if your father dies?

01:14:44.981 --> 01:14:47.982
Please, leave me alone.

01:14:49.785 --> 01:14:53.054
If you have the marriage
annulled, I'll say it's mine.

01:14:53.056 --> 01:14:54.555
Just get out!

01:14:54.557 --> 01:14:56.023
Shh.

01:15:01.663 --> 01:15:03.183
I guess I'll have to tell
the commander

01:15:03.207 --> 01:15:05.600
that you're hiding a <i> wolch...</i>

01:15:05.602 --> 01:15:07.101
who is spying.

01:15:10.038 --> 01:15:11.172
You know what you will get

01:15:11.174 --> 01:15:13.174
for collaborating
with the enemy.

01:15:28.557 --> 01:15:30.191
You have to leave.

01:15:54.784 --> 01:15:56.284
Hold on!

01:15:56.286 --> 01:15:57.652
There's another one.

01:15:57.654 --> 01:15:58.953
Come on!

01:15:58.955 --> 01:16:00.788
Pull! Pull!

01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:02.223
And pull!

01:16:12.768 --> 01:16:14.502
Don't shoot.

01:16:14.504 --> 01:16:15.770
I know him.

01:16:15.772 --> 01:16:18.439
Karl Gruber.

01:16:19.676 --> 01:16:21.809
Go get Karl Gruber, come on!

01:16:21.811 --> 01:16:24.078
Let's open the trap.

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.980
No, no, no!

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:36.824
Hey, Gruber.

01:16:36.826 --> 01:16:38.759
Hey, we need you.

01:16:38.761 --> 01:16:41.262
Come on...
Gruber, let's go!

01:17:05.287 --> 01:17:07.321
They can't just blow up
the mountain.

01:17:09.825 --> 01:17:11.792
You have to leave.

01:17:11.794 --> 01:17:14.895
Return to your positions.

01:17:14.897 --> 01:17:16.998
I'm going into the valley.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.300
No way.

01:17:19.302 --> 01:17:20.801
When will they blow it up?

01:17:23.105 --> 01:17:24.105
Today.

01:17:25.607 --> 01:17:27.074
Tomorrow.

01:17:29.077 --> 01:17:31.312
Anytime.

01:17:34.217 --> 01:17:35.716
I'm going.

01:17:37.586 --> 01:17:39.420
I said return
to your positions.

01:17:46.528 --> 01:17:49.196
High command ordered
all prisoners

01:17:49.198 --> 01:17:52.433
to be taken
to the valley immediately.

01:17:54.102 --> 01:17:56.370
Flight risk.

01:17:56.372 --> 01:17:57.872
Lieutenant Gruber.

01:18:17.059 --> 01:18:19.627
Assign one of your men...

01:18:19.629 --> 01:18:20.861
to take him down.

01:18:26.334 --> 01:18:28.269
Everybody, back in position!

01:18:28.271 --> 01:18:29.904
Understand?

01:18:29.906 --> 01:18:32.106
We hold this mountain!

01:18:32.108 --> 01:18:33.708
We hold this line!

01:18:33.710 --> 01:18:35.510
You heard the man.

01:18:55.864 --> 01:18:57.144
For you.

01:18:58.366 --> 01:19:00.501
Thank you.

01:19:00.503 --> 01:19:02.636
I will...

01:19:02.638 --> 01:19:06.140
would have preferred...

01:19:06.142 --> 01:19:09.777
to leave you
a real cable car, Ander.

01:19:11.279 --> 01:19:12.780
I know.

01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:36.551
Ander.

01:20:00.262 --> 01:20:02.296
You good to walk?

01:20:02.298 --> 01:20:03.798
I will make it.

01:20:05.634 --> 01:20:06.834
Listen.

01:20:06.836 --> 01:20:08.669
Your sister's in grave danger.

01:20:08.671 --> 01:20:09.951
What? Wha...

01:20:09.975 --> 01:20:11.872
Shh!

01:20:11.874 --> 01:20:13.314
What...
Shh.

01:20:15.477 --> 01:20:16.957
If you go this way,
get to the... barn

01:20:16.959 --> 01:20:18.319
just before you get
to the village.

01:20:18.343 --> 01:20:20.080
Wait there...
then I'll come get you.

01:20:20.082 --> 01:20:21.982
Good... take care of my sister.

01:20:21.984 --> 01:20:23.264
Just go.

01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:04.919
Halt!

01:22:07.055 --> 01:22:09.023
Got matches?

01:22:19.267 --> 01:22:20.427
Good afternoon, Commander.

01:22:20.451 --> 01:22:22.102
Good day to you, sir.

01:22:24.373 --> 01:22:26.373
You're a disgrace.

01:22:26.375 --> 01:22:28.509
Just returned from combat?

01:22:28.511 --> 01:22:30.210
Look at you, soldier.

01:22:30.212 --> 01:22:33.280
We will never win
the war like that.

01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:34.848
Get another uniform.

01:22:34.850 --> 01:22:36.784
You stink.

01:22:36.786 --> 01:22:37.952
Yes, sir.

01:22:49.898 --> 01:22:52.366
That's him, the <i> wolch</i> spy!

01:22:52.368 --> 01:22:53.368
Get down!

01:22:54.936 --> 01:22:57.338
You sorry little
Italian bastard.

01:22:57.340 --> 01:22:59.406
I wanted to see you
on your knees.

01:22:59.408 --> 01:23:01.742
On your knees, now!

01:23:01.744 --> 01:23:03.811
Can't you hear me?

01:23:03.813 --> 01:23:05.312
How dare you!

01:23:10.185 --> 01:23:12.052
There! Down there!

01:23:12.054 --> 01:23:13.420
There's another spy!

01:23:13.422 --> 01:23:18.692
Run!

01:23:18.694 --> 01:23:20.894
They're coming, they're coming!

01:23:21.897 --> 01:23:23.263
Get out, you shysters.

01:23:23.265 --> 01:23:24.598
You just ruin everything here.

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:26.934
There's a spy.
Get out!

01:23:26.936 --> 01:23:28.736
What are you looking for, huh?

01:23:28.738 --> 01:23:30.898
All you do is mess things up,
get out of here!

01:23:30.900 --> 01:23:31.999
You need to step out
of the way, ma'am.

01:23:32.001 --> 01:23:33.374
You are not going anywhere.

01:23:33.376 --> 01:23:34.742
Good luck.
Let's go!

01:23:34.744 --> 01:23:36.243
Get out!
Come on, move it!

01:23:36.245 --> 01:23:37.845
Get out from under there.

01:23:37.847 --> 01:23:39.927
Get out.
Get to the left.

01:24:16.684 --> 01:24:18.152
Don't look!

01:24:18.154 --> 01:24:19.653
Don't look!

01:25:43.404 --> 01:25:45.924
Ander!

01:25:45.948 --> 01:25:48.308
I am not angry with you!

01:25:49.244 --> 01:25:50.878
Ander! Where are you?

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:53.120
It's gonna be all right,
it's gonna be all right.

01:25:53.144 --> 01:25:55.544
It's gonna be all right.
Ander!

01:25:56.117 --> 01:25:58.318
Did she seduce you?

01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.988
She did the same to me, Ander.

01:26:00.990 --> 01:26:04.224
Don't worry,
we will sort it out!

01:26:04.226 --> 01:26:06.393
Ander!

01:26:39.894 --> 01:26:41.395
Francesca.

01:26:46.201 --> 01:26:47.234
Francesca.

01:27:54.802 --> 01:27:56.882
Not the worst place to die.

01:29:48.383 --> 01:29:52.386
As the Italian soldier
came closer, he stumbled...

01:29:59.861 --> 01:30:03.330
as if he finally found
what he was looking for,

01:30:03.332 --> 01:30:04.831
and it was not me.

01:30:06.768 --> 01:30:09.503
He held the kettle and poured.

01:30:11.539 --> 01:30:12.973
There was nothing in it.

01:31:13.968 --> 01:31:16.536
We didn't know
where we were going.

01:31:16.538 --> 01:31:18.538
We just knew it would
be together.

01:31:20.808 --> 01:31:23.910
But I still dream
of the mountains...

01:31:23.912 --> 01:31:25.912
with no soldiers...

01:31:27.582 --> 01:31:29.049
just mountains.

01:31:31.586 --> 01:31:32.686
Just silence.
