YOU'RE NOT SO BAD YOURSELF.

- SO DO YOU WANT TO SPOON?

00:14.848 --> 00:18.017
- YEAH!

00:21.187 --> 00:23.565
- HE WANTS TO BE
THE LITTLE SPOON?

00:23.648 --> 00:27.318
- YES,
WHICH MAKES ME THE BIG SPOON.

00:27.402 --> 00:29.571
- THAT'S CRAZY.
- I KNOW!

00:29.654 --> 00:32.031
- NO WOMAN SHOULD BE
THE JETPACK.

00:34.576 --> 00:36.286
- WELL, WAS THE SEX WORTH IT?

00:36.369 --> 00:38.288
- HE DID A COUPLE OF THINGS.

00:38.371 --> 00:39.831
TWO THAT WERE GOOD,
ONE NOT SO GOOD.

00:42.208 --> 00:44.294
IT'S RARE TO FIND
A MAN THAT'S GOOD AT THAT,

00:44.377 --> 00:46.838
LET'S FACE IT, RIGHT?
- YOU HAVE A POINT, YEAH.

00:50.383 --> 00:53.303

THE TRUTH ABOUT THE SPOONING.

00:53.386 --> 00:55.513
WHAT DO YOU THINK, SIMON?

00:55.597 --> 00:57.640
- I THINK YOU'RE CONFIRMING
MY WORST FEAR THAT ANYTHING I DO

00:57.724 --> 00:59.184
IN BED WILL BE ANALYZED
AND DISSECTED

00:59.267 --> 01:01.436
BY A PACK OF CRITICAL FEMALES.

01:04.938 --> 01:07.317

TO WORRY ABOUT.

YOU'RE AN UNCUT JEWEL.

- SIMON'S RIGHT, NO GUY WANTS TO
HEAR WHAT ANNOYS YOU ABOUT HIM.

01:19.287 --> 01:21.498
- I USED TO GET ANNOYED
WHEN EMMET USED HIS NETI POT

01:21.581 --> 01:23.082
TO CLEAR HIS SINUSES.

01:25.752 --> 01:29.005
WHAT I WOULDN'T GIVE NOW
TO SEE HIM POUR SALTED WATER

01:29.088 --> 01:31.883
IN ONE NOSTRIL AND WATCH IT
SLOWLY DRIP OUT OF THE OTHER.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.346
YOU KNOW, ONE TIME
HE COULDN'T FIND IT,

01:36.429 --> 01:38.932
SO HE USED
THAT COFFEE CREAMER.

01:46.314 --> 01:50.360
- NOW, STAY STRONG, VICTORIA.
I'M WORKING ON A LEAD.

01:50.443 --> 01:53.321

"HOW CAN YOU WALK
IN THOSE THINGS?"

OR, "DON'T YOU HAVE SIX PAIRS
JUST LIKE THAT?"

02:28.314 --> 02:30.733
OR, "HOW CAN ONE PAIR OF SHOES
COST $3,000?"

02:30.817 --> 02:34.070
I MEAN, THEY'RE IDIOTS.

02:34.153 --> 02:37.073
HEY, I DIDN'T ORDER THESE.

IN EVERY PHOTO.

HER LEGS LOOK PALE AND PASTY,

A PICTURE OF VICTORIA?

09:19.892 --> 09:21.769
- SORRY,
IT'S A REFLEX ACTION.

09:21.852 --> 09:23.813
I SEE A CELEBRITY MISBEHAVING,
I SNAP A PHOTO.

09:23.896 --> 09:25.690
- BUT VICTORIA
IS OUR FRIEND.

09:25.773 --> 09:27.149
- WELL, I COULD KEEP VICTORIA
OUT OF IT.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.985
EMMET IS THE REAL STORY.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.778
- BUT THAT WOULD HURT
VICTORIA TOO.

09:30.861 --> 09:31.946
- WELL, ALL OF MY PHOTOS
HURT SOMEBODY.

09:32.029 --> 09:33.698
THAT'S MY JOB.

09:33.781 --> 09:35.658
- WELL, IF IT'S MADE YOU
SO CALLOUS,

09:35.741 --> 09:37.618
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T
DO THAT JOB!

WHO JUST SPENT TEN MINUTES

09:39.620 --> 09:42.498
TRYING TO FIND A TRACE OF
CELLULITE ON HALLE BERRY'S ASS!

09:42.581 --> 09:46.586
- THAT'S DIFFERENT.
AND DON'T ASK WHY, IT JUST IS.

09:46.669 --> 09:49.505
SIMON, YOU SAID YOURSELF
YOU WERE SICK OF HIDING

09:49.588 --> 09:51.507
IN TREES AND DUMPSTERS
AND TAKING PICTURES

09:51.591 --> 09:53.968
OF CELEBRITIES PUMPING GAS.

09:54.051 --> 09:56.053
- WHY DO PEOPLE WANT CELEBRITIES
TO BE JUST LIKE US?

09:56.137 --> 09:58.306
IT MAKES NO SENSE!

09:58.389 --> 10:02.852
JOY, ONE PHOTO OF EMMET LAWSON
ALIVE WOULD BE WORTH MILLIONS.

10:02.935 --> 10:04.812
I COULD GET OUT OF THE GAME

10:04.895 --> 10:06.647
AND STILL PAY
FOR OUR GRANDSON'S EDUCATION.

10:06.731 --> 10:09.650
- I WOULDN'T LET THAT MONEY GO
TO WILBUR.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.777
SIMON, IF YOU DO THIS,
WE'RE THROUGH.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.654
- WHAT,
YOU'RE THREATENING ME NOW?

10:13.738 --> 10:15.781
YOU CAN'T TELL ME
HOW TO RUN MY BUSINESS.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.325
- MAYBE NOT, BUT I CAN TELL YOU
TO GET OUT OF MY BED!

10:17.408 --> 10:20.036
- OH, FINE!

10:20.119 --> 10:21.704
- SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
- I DON'T KNOW.

10:21.787 --> 10:23.622
BUT IF WE'RE GONNA
STAY TOGETHER,

10:23.706 --> 10:25.541
YOU GOTTA LEARN
THAT I'M THE ONE

10:25.625 --> 10:26.542
THAT WEARS THE PANTS
IN THIS RELATIONSHIP.

10:26.625 --> 10:28.544
- THOSE ARE MY PANTS.

10:28.627 --> 10:30.338
- I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN!
THEY'RE BUSTING MY BALLS!

10:33.632 --> 10:37.553
- SO ONCE AGAIN, LAST NIGHT,
I WAS THE BIG SPOON.

10:37.636 --> 10:39.764
I'M JUST GONNA HAVE TO TELL HIM
STRAIGHT TO HIS FACE.

10:39.847 --> 10:41.974
- MAKE A NICE CHANGE
FROM TALKING TO HIS NECK.

10:44.810 --> 10:48.064
- HAS SIMON CALLED?
- NO, WHY, WHAT'S UP?

10:48.147 --> 10:50.149
- WE HAD A FIGHT.

10:50.232 --> 10:51.734
HE WANTS TO BREAK THE STORY
ABOUT YOU AND EMMET.

10:51.817 --> 10:53.736
- WHAT?
YOU'VE GOT TO STOP HIM.

10:53.819 --> 10:55.738
- I HOPE I DID.

10:55.821 --> 10:56.864
I TOLD HIM
IF HE WENT AHEAD WITH IT,

10:56.947 --> 10:58.908
HE'D NEVER SEE ME AGAIN.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.951
- COULDN'T YOU HAVE
COME UP WITH A BETTER THREAT?

11:03.662 --> 11:05.539
- LISTEN,
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

11:05.623 --> 11:07.541
- I CAN'T DO ANYTHING.
EVERYTHING IS IN MOTION.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.377
I'VE GOT A PLANE TO CATCH.

11:09.460 --> 11:10.753
IF SIMON DOES THIS,

11:10.836 --> 11:12.630
THEN EMMET AND I ARE JUST

11:12.713 --> 11:15.966
GONNA HAVE TO STAY
ONE STEP AHEAD OF HIM.

11:16.050 --> 11:18.552
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE LEAVING.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.721
I'M GONNA MISS YOU SO MUCH.

11:20.805 --> 11:21.722
- ME TOO.

11:23.724 --> 11:25.101
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIENDS,

11:25.184 --> 11:27.019
AND I LOVE YOU.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.437
- I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT IT'S GONNA BE LIKE

11:28.521 --> 11:29.772
LIVING HERE WITHOUT YOU.

11:29.855 --> 11:31.774
- I KNOW.

11:31.857 --> 11:33.901
I'VE BEEN THE SUN
THAT YOU THREE REVOLVE AROUND.

11:39.865 --> 11:44.120
BUT STILL, I KNOW,
IT'S HARD TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

11:44.203 --> 11:46.372
- YOU'RE MAKING IT EASIER.

11:53.045 --> 11:56.090
- I DIRECTED VICTORIA
IN 27 LIFETIME ORIGINAL MOVIES,

11:56.173 --> 11:58.634
AND ALTHOUGH
SHE NEVER LEARNED MY NAME,

11:58.717 --> 12:00.803
I WAS PROUD TO CALL HER
MY FRIEND.

12:00.886 --> 12:01.512
THANK YOU.

12:04.432 --> 12:07.351
- SADLY, VICTORIA'S DAUGHTER
EMMY COULD NOT JOIN US TODAY,

12:07.435 --> 12:10.771
BUT SHE SENDS THESE WORDS.

12:10.855 --> 12:14.775
"MY MOTHER WAS AN ANGEL
AND AN INSPIRATION TO ME.

12:14.859 --> 12:16.652
"WE WERE BLESSED
TO HAVE HAD SUCH

12:16.735 --> 12:18.946
"A BRIGHT, BRILLIANT FLAME
IN OUR LIVES.

12:19.029 --> 12:20.990
I WILL BE HEARTBROKEN
WITHOUT HER."

12:21.073 --> 12:23.117
- [cries]

12:23.200 --> 12:25.161
- IT'S ESPECIALLY SAD
WHEN THEY'RE TAKEN SO YOUNG.

12:25.244 --> 12:27.037
- SHE LIVED A FULL LIFE.

12:27.121 --> 12:28.956
- TRUE, BUT STILL,
SHE DIED YOUNG.

12:29.039 --> 12:32.001
- WELL--
- SHE WAS YOUNG.

12:32.084 --> 12:34.170
- AND I KNOW
YOU REMEMBER THIS MAN.

12:34.253 --> 12:35.337
RAM STERLING,
FROM <i> EDGE OF TOMORROW.</i>

12:35.421 --> 12:38.966
[applause]

12:39.049 --> 12:43.137
- VICTORIA CHASE
WAS A MIRACLE WORKER.

12:43.220 --> 12:45.973
WE DID A SCENE ON <i> EDGE</i>
WHERE SHE FIRST SHOT ME,

12:46.056 --> 12:48.142
THEN MADE LOVE TO ME

12:48.225 --> 12:50.978
BEFORE LEAVING ME TO DIE
IN AN ABANDONED DIAMOND MINE.

12:53.272 --> 12:56.692
WHEN I READ IT,
I THOUGHT, "NO WAY."

12:56.775 --> 13:01.280
BUT VIC ACTED IT REAL,
AND IT SANG.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.659
IT WAS A GIFT TO PLAY
HER BROTHER ALL THOSE YEARS.

13:11.123 --> 13:15.127
NOW, SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW
THAT I AM A AMATEUR PAINTER.

13:15.211 --> 13:18.047
AND IN THE FINAL SEASON
OF <i> EDGE OF TOMORROW,</i>

13:18.130 --> 13:21.050
VICTORIA GRACIOUSLY POSED
FOR A NUDE PORTRAIT

13:21.133 --> 13:22.051
ON THE CONDITION
THAT I WOULD NOT SHOW IT

13:22.134 --> 13:23.135
UNTIL AFTER HER DEATH.

13:26.138 --> 13:27.681
- OH, DEAR GOD.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.852
THOSE ARE REAL.

13:34.188 --> 13:36.398
- SIMON!
- BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING,

13:36.482 --> 13:39.401
I DELETED THE PHOTO, AND I'M NOT
GONNA DO THE STORY ON EMMET.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.111
BUT NOT BECAUSE MY GIRLFRIEND
TOLD ME TO.

13:41.195 --> 13:43.072
I DECIDED ON MY OWN.

13:43.155 --> 13:45.032
- STILL, THIS GIRLFRIEND
MUST BE PRETTY AMAZING

13:45.115 --> 13:46.242
FOR YOU TO DO THAT.

13:46.325 --> 13:48.077
- SHE IS.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.453
- WELL, THEN YOU BETTER
NOT TELL HER

13:49.537 --> 13:52.581
THAT I'M ABOUT TO KISS YOU.

13:52.665 --> 13:57.127
- THANK YOU, RAM, FOR THAT, UH,
WONDERFULLY GRAPHIC TRIBUTE.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.588
AND NOW, VICTORIA'S DEAR FRIEND
ELKA OSTROVSKY

13:59.672 --> 14:01.173
WOULD LIKE TO SAY
A FEW WORDS.

14:04.009 --> 14:07.096
- VICTORIA CHASE
MAY HAVE BEEN VAIN,

14:07.179 --> 14:10.558
BUBBLEHEADED, AND CRAZY...

14:10.641 --> 14:12.101
- BUT?

14:12.184 --> 14:14.228
- THERE'S NO "BUT."

14:20.359 --> 14:22.736
- VICTORIA WAS
MORE THAN A FRIEND TO ME.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.154
SHE WAS A SISTER.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.240
LOYAL AND GENEROUS

14:26.323 --> 14:30.119
AND WISER THAN SHE EVER
GOT CREDIT FOR.

14:30.202 --> 14:32.246
I'LL MISS YOU FOREVER,
MY DARLING.

14:32.329 --> 14:35.124
- WE ALL WILL.
WE LOVE YOU, VICTORIA.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.710
YOU ARE LEAVING A HOLE IN OUR
LIVES THAT CAN NEVER BE FILLED.

14:39.545 --> 14:41.171
- MAY I SAY SOMETHING, PLEASE?

14:41.255 --> 14:44.341
[applause]

14:46.176 --> 14:48.637
- LUCCI.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.265
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

14:51.348 --> 14:53.934
AND THANK YOU, VICTORIA,

14:54.018 --> 14:56.312
FOR SO MANY, MANY,<i> MANY</i>

14:56.395 --> 14:59.023
YEARS OF WORK.

14:59.106 --> 15:02.192
RISING BEFORE DAWN
TO PUT ON ALL THAT MAKEUP...

15:04.695 --> 15:09.825
IN A BRAVE BUT FUTILE ATTEMPT
TO HIDE THE RAVAGES OF TIME.

15:09.908 --> 15:13.412
AND NOW, PICTURING HER
IN A COFFIN

15:13.495 --> 15:15.372
REMINDS ME
OF THOSE PERFORMANCES.

15:17.249 --> 15:20.294
STIFF AND LIFELESS,

15:20.377 --> 15:24.048
HELD TOGETHER WITH CHEMICALS
AND GLUE.

15:24.131 --> 15:26.884
SOMETHING BEST BURIED
AND FORGOTTEN.

15:29.762 --> 15:33.182
OH, VICTORIA.

15:33.265 --> 15:35.809
I PROMISED MYSELF
I WOULDN'T CRY,

15:35.893 --> 15:38.646
AND I'VE KEPT THAT PROMISE.

15:38.729 --> 15:39.688
THANK YOU.

15:39.772 --> 15:44.151
[applause]

15:44.234 --> 15:45.861
[all gasping]

15:45.944 --> 15:47.738
WHAT?

15:47.821 --> 15:51.075
WE ALL KNOW I DESERVED
TO WIN THAT YEAR.

16:00.668 --> 16:03.253
- I CAN'T BELIEVE VICTORIA
IS REALLY GONE.

16:03.337 --> 16:05.422
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
I MISS HER.

16:07.091 --> 16:09.385
- I'M WORRIED ABOUT HER.

16:09.468 --> 16:11.553
I MEAN, IT GETS DOWN
TO 20 BELOW IN KAFIRISTAN.

16:11.637 --> 16:15.349
THIS IS A WOMAN WHO DOESN'T OWN
ANYTHING WITH SLEEVES.

16:15.432 --> 16:16.433
- [sighs]
HELLO, EVERYONE.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.352
- VICTORIA, YOU'RE HERE!

16:18.435 --> 16:20.562
- OH, HONEY, YOU DIDN'T GO!
- NO, I JUST--

16:20.646 --> 16:22.731
I COULDN'T DO IT.
- OH.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.401
- OF COURSE, I HAD TO GO
AND JUST TAKE A PEEK

16:25.484 --> 16:28.237
AT MY OWN FUNERAL, BUT--
OH, LOOK, I--

16:28.320 --> 16:32.366
IT JUST CONVINCED ME THAT
I HAD TOO MANY REASONS TO STAY.

16:32.449 --> 16:35.327
YOU KNOW, I LOVE EMMET,
BUT I CAN'T JUST KILL OFF

16:35.411 --> 16:37.913
EVERYONE ELSE IN MY LIFE.

16:37.996 --> 16:39.581
BUT WHAT AM I GONNA DO NOW?

16:39.665 --> 16:41.375
I MEAN, THE WHOLE WORLD THINKS

16:41.458 --> 16:44.378
THAT I THREW MYSELF
OFF A BRIDGE.

16:44.461 --> 16:46.255
[sighs]
- ACTUALLY, NOBODY THINKS THAT.

16:46.338 --> 16:49.591
- WHAT?

16:49.675 --> 16:52.302
- WE NEVER REPORTED
YOUR FAKE DEATH.

16:52.386 --> 16:54.221
- NO, BUT MELANIE WAS
ON THE PHONE WITH--

16:54.304 --> 16:56.056
- I WAS NEVER ON THE PHONE
WITH THE PRESS.

16:56.140 --> 16:57.766
AND THAT MEMORIAL SERVICE
WAS STAGED.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.477
- IT WAS A FAKE FAKE FUNERAL.

17:03.731 --> 17:05.733
- VICTORIA, WE KNOW YOU.

17:05.816 --> 17:08.359
A ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE
SINGING YOUR PRAISES--

17:08.444 --> 17:10.445
WE KNEW
YOU COULDN'T PASS THAT UP.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.573
AND ONCE YOU REALIZED
WHAT YOU'D BE GIVING UP,

17:12.656 --> 17:15.284
WE HOPED YOU'D COME
TO YOUR SENSES.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.786
- OH, MY GOD.

17:17.869 --> 17:19.829
SO NONE OF THOSE NICE THINGS
PEOPLE WERE SAYING WERE TRUE.

17:19.913 --> 17:22.124
- NO, HONEY, THEY WERE TRUE.

17:22.207 --> 17:24.209
WE TOLD THEM
THAT IT WAS PART

17:24.292 --> 17:27.296
OF A NEW REALITY SHOW CALLED
<i>CELEBRITY FUNERALS,</i>

17:27.378 --> 17:29.131
WHICH WE WOULD FILM NOW

17:29.214 --> 17:32.009
AND AIR IMMEDIATELY
AFTER YOU DO DIE.

17:32.092 --> 17:35.012
- I WOULD WATCH THAT SHOW.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.099
- WELL, WE'RE REALLY GLAD
YOU STAYED,

17:39.183 --> 17:40.350
AND I'M SURE EMMET
WILL UNDERSTAND.

17:40.434 --> 17:43.812
- OH, BUT IT BREAKS MY HEART.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.315
AS HAPPY AS I AM
THAT EMMET IS ALIVE,

17:46.398 --> 17:48.275
I'M NEVER GONNA SEE HIM AGAIN.

17:48.358 --> 17:50.486
- OH, COME ON,
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

17:50.569 --> 17:51.653
BUT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,
WE WILL HELP YOU THROUGH IT.

17:51.737 --> 17:55.324
- WELL, I'M COUNTING ON THAT.

17:55.407 --> 17:56.700
[sighs]
OKAY.

18:02.748 --> 18:05.459
GOOD-BYE, EMMET.

18:05.542 --> 18:07.503
UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.423
[sighs]

18:20.390 --> 18:22.017
- WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY ANYTHING?

18:22.100 --> 18:24.269
- I DIDN'T WANT TO HURT
YOUR FEELINGS.

18:24.353 --> 18:27.898
- LOOK, I'VE NEVER SPOONED
THE OTHER WAY BEFORE,

18:27.981 --> 18:30.692
BUT WHAT THE HELL?
A GUY CAN CHANGE, RIGHT?

18:30.776 --> 18:32.110
- OKAY.

18:40.744 --> 18:43.080
- HOW'S THIS FOR YOU?
- I LOVE IT.

18:47.125 --> 18:49.044
- I HAVE GOT
THE BIGGEST THANK-YOU PLANNED

18:49.127 --> 18:50.879
FOR WHAT YOU DID TODAY.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.006
- WELL, BEFORE YOU THANK
MY BRAINS OUT,

18:53.090 --> 18:55.217
WHICH I'M VERY MUCH
LOOKING FORWARD TO,

18:55.300 --> 18:57.886
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.680
VICTORIA'S FUNERAL
GOT ME THINKING

18:59.763 --> 19:01.682
ABOUT WHAT I WANT TO DO
BEFORE I DIE.

19:01.765 --> 19:03.725
I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT ME
AND SEE A GOOD GUY,

19:03.809 --> 19:06.019
NOT SOMEONE WHO'S REMEMBERED
FOR GETTING A PHOTO

19:06.103 --> 19:08.730
OF GWYNETH PALTROW
IN AN UNFLATTERING BATHING SUIT.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.024
- DOES THAT EXIST?

19:11.108 --> 19:13.777
- YES,
BUT THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

19:13.861 --> 19:17.239
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS, YOU'VE
INSPIRED ME TO MAKE A CHANGE.

19:17.322 --> 19:18.907
I QUIT MY JOB.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.952
- YOU DID?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

19:22.035 --> 19:25.038
- WELL, HERE'S WHERE
IT GETS TRICKY.

19:25.122 --> 19:28.083
A BUDDY OF MINE IS MAKING
A DOCUMENTARY IN THE SUDAN,

19:28.166 --> 19:29.751
AND HE'S ASKED ME
TO BE PART OF IT.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.795
- OH, SIMON,
THAT'S SO EXCITING!

19:31.879 --> 19:34.047
YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO DO THAT.

19:34.131 --> 19:36.717
- YEAH, BUT I'D BE EMBEDDED
WITH AN ELITE MILITARY UNIT.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.927
THEY WANT ME TO LEAVE
NEXT WEEK.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.138
I WOULDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS
GOING OR HOW LONG I'D BE GONE.

19:41.221 --> 19:43.599
- OH.

19:43.682 --> 19:45.267
WELL, OF COURSE,
YOU HAVE TO SAY YES.

19:45.350 --> 19:46.977
- ARE YOU SURE?

19:47.060 --> 19:49.605
- I AM.

19:49.688 --> 19:51.440
- I CAN'T ASK YOU
TO WAIT FOR ME.

19:51.523 --> 19:53.275
DON'T GET ME WRONG,
I WANT YOU TO.

19:53.358 --> 19:55.819
I JUST DON'T THINK
IT'D BE FAIR.

19:55.903 --> 19:57.988
I FEEL TERRIBLE.

19:58.071 --> 20:00.616
IT'S LIKE IT'S 30 YEARS AGO,
AND I'M LEAVING YOU AGAIN.

20:00.699 --> 20:03.744
- ONLY THIS TIME,
I'M BEING LEFT BY A BETTER MAN.

20:09.166 --> 20:11.251
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T TALK
ABOUT YOUR LEAVING.

20:11.335 --> 20:13.337
- YES, LET'S REMEMBER
THAT WE'RE BRITISH

20:13.420 --> 20:16.006
AND PRETEND
THAT EVERYTHING IS NORMAL.

20:16.089 --> 20:19.051
- YES, KEEP CALM
AND CARRY ON.

20:26.892 --> 20:29.186
JUST HOW UNFLATTERING
WAS GWYNETH'S BATHING SUIT?

20:32.189 --> 20:34.691
- HIDEOUS--FLATTENED HER BREASTS
AND GAVE HER BACK FAT.

20:34.775 --> 20:35.984
- OH, YES!
