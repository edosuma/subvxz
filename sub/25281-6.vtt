00:27.445 --> 00:29.989
Hey. Sorry, buddy.

00:33.517 --> 00:35.369
This is fucking killing me.

00:35.411 --> 00:37.580
Yeah, I know.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.667
Well, look,
Wallace is a tough prosecutor.

00:41.709 --> 00:44.003
She did everything by the book.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.686
She was, she was clean.

00:46.728 --> 00:49.008
Cooperman's on Davis's advisory board.

00:49.533 --> 00:51.743
It's too late for that.

00:52.553 --> 00:55.038
Way past a governor's reprieve.

00:56.415 --> 00:58.434
What time is it?

00:58.476 --> 01:00.770
You got a couple hours.

01:06.550 --> 01:08.844
Is there anything I can do?

01:09.361 --> 01:11.530
No. No, I'm, uh...

01:12.389 --> 01:13.991
I'm gonna...

01:15.993 --> 01:20.456
Look, I'm, uh, just...
sit here for a while.

01:21.359 --> 01:22.750
Yeah.

01:24.668 --> 01:26.921
If you need anything, let me know.

01:27.885 --> 01:28.964
Thank you.

01:55.533 --> 01:57.493
At this point,

01:57.535 --> 02:01.497
we have no stays or reprieves
from the governor's office.

02:01.539 --> 02:04.733
This execution will continue.

02:07.861 --> 02:10.005
Do you have any last words?

02:20.474 --> 02:23.919
To my mom and my family,

02:24.436 --> 02:26.897
God bless you guys.

02:26.939 --> 02:29.316
I'm all right with this,

02:30.050 --> 02:32.361
'cause-'cause I know the truth.

02:35.698 --> 02:37.474
To JT...

02:39.451 --> 02:41.853
you believed me, man.

02:43.122 --> 02:44.982
You were the only one.

02:46.542 --> 02:48.544
You tried.

02:55.467 --> 02:57.411
Have you finished?

03:05.019 --> 03:07.504
Let the execution proceed.

03:49.688 --> 03:53.692
12:15 a.m.

05:15.941 --> 05:17.901
So what kind of work do you do, Billy?

05:17.943 --> 05:19.319
I'm a lawyer.

05:19.361 --> 05:21.321
Oh, a lawyer. That makes perfect sense.

05:21.363 --> 05:23.073
How's that?

05:23.115 --> 05:26.326
Well, troublemaker like Marisol
could always use a good lawyer.

05:26.368 --> 05:27.786
- Huh?
- Stop it.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.621
Ah, she hates it when I tease her.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.582
You should have told me
you were having a party.

05:31.623 --> 05:33.834
Are you thirsty, Billy?

05:33.876 --> 05:35.836
- Yeah, I could use a drink.
- Yeah, please, this way.

05:38.130 --> 05:41.133
Here in Mexico, we have
a tradition of quinceañera,

05:41.616 --> 05:43.010
when a girl becomes a woman.

05:43.535 --> 05:44.720
Do you have any children, Billy?

05:44.762 --> 05:46.597
Yeah, I got a daughter.

05:46.638 --> 05:48.682
She's amazing. She's
volunteering for my campaign.

05:48.724 --> 05:50.809
If Marisol likes her,
she must be very special.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.895
Yeah, she's the center
of my universe, all right.

05:52.936 --> 05:54.313
- Gracias.
- Gracias.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.589
¿Salud?

05:56.857 --> 05:58.692
Okay.

05:58.734 --> 05:59.746
- Oh, yeah, sorry about that.

05:59.771 --> 06:00.758
- Mm.
- Here's to you.

06:00.800 --> 06:02.279
Yeah. You were thirsty.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.964
What's up, party people? How is everyone?

06:21.006 --> 06:22.549
Welcome!

06:22.591 --> 06:25.803
How lovely that we are all
here on this beautiful day

06:25.844 --> 06:27.221
because we are celebrating

06:27.262 --> 06:29.348
a very important day in
the life of a woman.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.974
Or in this case,

06:31.016 --> 06:32.476
women.

06:32.518 --> 06:34.169
Because today we celebrate...

06:35.631 --> 06:37.216
The Quinceañera.

06:37.241 --> 06:39.994
Of Paz and Mercedes!

06:52.412 --> 06:53.956
I speak for your parents,

06:53.997 --> 06:56.900
for our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ,

06:57.501 --> 07:00.087
And for myself,

07:00.129 --> 07:02.923
DJ Diego Spinz,

07:02.965 --> 07:04.049
When I say,

07:04.091 --> 07:05.742
Paz and Mercedes,

07:06.510 --> 07:08.375
Happy Quinceañera.

07:14.143 --> 07:16.061
And now,

07:16.103 --> 07:19.022
Our gracious host and patron,

07:19.064 --> 07:22.192
Paz and Mercedes' esteemed godfather,

07:22.234 --> 07:25.028
Mr. Gabriel Ortega,

07:25.070 --> 07:26.989
will you do the honors?

07:38.375 --> 07:41.211
Welcome to my home, everyone.

07:41.253 --> 07:43.172
For me it is an honor

07:43.213 --> 07:45.674
to be the host of this great event

07:45.716 --> 07:48.969
and to be the godfather of
these two beautiful princesses.

07:49.536 --> 07:52.389
Today we recognize these girls

07:52.431 --> 07:54.862
as they become women.

07:54.863 --> 07:57.324
If they are good women,

07:57.366 --> 07:59.576
their lives will be blessed by God.

07:59.618 --> 08:01.453
Congratulations.

08:31.734 --> 08:35.195
A round of applause
for my two Cinderellas.

09:04.683 --> 09:06.950
You're very stiff.

09:06.992 --> 09:08.490
Well, of course I'm stiff.

09:08.532 --> 09:09.811
I told you, I can't fucking dance.

09:09.852 --> 09:12.166
- Just-just go left and right.
- Yeah, okay.

09:12.191 --> 09:14.235
- Like that?
- Yes, exactly.

09:14.277 --> 09:16.487
Okay, great.

09:16.529 --> 09:18.489
So was your childhood like this?

09:18.531 --> 09:20.241
I mean, this is pretty ritzy, you know.

09:20.283 --> 09:21.787
I thought you had humble beginnings.

09:21.828 --> 09:23.648
I never had a quinceañera.

09:23.689 --> 09:25.435
Yeah. Why's that?

09:25.435 --> 09:27.604
Because I went to the States
before I turned 15.

09:27.646 --> 09:30.315
Hmm. Maybe they'll give you
some kind of honorary

09:30.357 --> 09:31.817
- diploma or something.
- No, thank you.

09:31.858 --> 09:33.318
Or whatever.

09:33.360 --> 09:36.071
I think it's a ridiculous tradition.

09:36.113 --> 09:39.866
You know, girls dressed up like
dolls because they became women.

09:39.908 --> 09:42.536
I don't know. They should want
something better than that.

09:42.577 --> 09:44.121
Yeah, they'll figure it out.

09:44.162 --> 09:46.498
- Just give them time.
- Ugh.

09:46.540 --> 09:48.125
I don't want to be 15 again.

09:48.166 --> 09:50.791
- Ugh. I know that.
- Yeah, me either.

09:50.833 --> 09:53.505
Wouldn't mind being 19 again, though.

09:53.547 --> 09:55.549
You know?

10:04.808 --> 10:06.643
See, that's better than
dancing, isn't it?

10:07.544 --> 10:09.035
A little better.

10:09.077 --> 10:11.690
So, I'm feeling kind of like
I need to check in with Denise,

10:11.732 --> 10:13.442
but my cell phone won't work up here.

10:13.483 --> 10:15.277
- Is there anyplace you can go that...?
- Oh, yeah.

10:15.319 --> 10:17.279
Yeah, we're in a very remote place,

10:17.321 --> 10:20.282
but there's a satellite phone
in the billiard room.

10:20.324 --> 10:22.200
- Yeah? Yeah?
- Yeah, you can go if you want.

10:22.242 --> 10:23.827
- They won't mind me using it?
- Mm-mm.

10:23.869 --> 10:25.829
Yeah. Oh. Lipstick?

10:25.871 --> 10:28.225
- Yeah.
- Yeah. You sure?

10:28.267 --> 10:30.459
- Yeah, it's fine.
- Okay. I'll be back in a minute.

10:53.784 --> 10:55.236
How many cards do we have?

10:55.277 --> 10:56.526
Okay, so you should have five cards.

10:56.568 --> 10:59.279
And you want
to keep anything that's a pair.

10:59.321 --> 11:02.404
Or anything that's,
like, really exciting.

11:02.446 --> 11:05.118
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, I want four back, please.

11:05.160 --> 11:06.828
Oh.

11:06.870 --> 11:09.873
Now I'm gonna put
the top one that I had on top.

11:10.361 --> 11:12.626
Four. Uh, you guys...

11:12.667 --> 11:15.504
Ooh, you're gonna kill me.
You're gonna kill me.

11:15.545 --> 11:17.506
No.

11:17.547 --> 11:19.829
Did you beat that?

11:20.675 --> 11:22.052
And I beat an eight.

11:22.094 --> 11:23.512
You got to beat a queen.

11:23.553 --> 11:25.263
You got to still beat a queen.

11:27.265 --> 11:29.267
You still got to beat a queen.

11:29.309 --> 11:32.312
He's got to...

11:37.526 --> 11:38.902
Hey.

11:38.944 --> 11:41.571
You somewhere you can talk?

11:41.613 --> 11:44.408
Yeah. What's up?

11:44.449 --> 11:46.618
Think we're fucked, Keith.

11:49.442 --> 11:50.872
How do you mean?

11:51.277 --> 11:52.833
Just heard someone's flipping.

11:52.874 --> 11:54.835
Can't get ahold of Tom.

11:54.876 --> 11:56.920
And what do you think we should do?

11:56.962 --> 11:59.172
- You think it's Tom?
- It's got to be.

11:59.214 --> 12:00.841
It's not you. It's not me.

12:00.882 --> 12:03.009
Not like Tom not to return my calls.

12:03.051 --> 12:05.303
He's gonna fuck us to save his own ass.

12:05.345 --> 12:07.305
Yeah.

12:07.347 --> 12:09.266
Sounds like something he'd do.

12:10.171 --> 12:12.185
Look, um...

12:12.227 --> 12:14.771
I can't do this over the phone.
Can we meet somewhere?

12:15.301 --> 12:17.315
Just-just come up with a plan?

12:23.905 --> 12:27.492
Yeah. Yeah, it's a good idea.

12:28.314 --> 12:30.954
We got to get out of this.

12:30.996 --> 12:32.998
I'll text you where.

12:45.290 --> 12:47.804
What a fucking prick.
Sounds like something I'd do?

12:47.846 --> 12:49.556
Fuck that guy.

12:49.598 --> 12:52.476
- I think he's onto us.
- He's onto us.

12:52.517 --> 12:55.520
Yeah, I bet he knew
I was listening. He knew.

12:55.562 --> 12:58.607
Is that really what's
fucking important right now?

13:00.609 --> 13:02.652
Danny, I can tell you're stressed out,

13:02.694 --> 13:05.059
so I'm gonna let this one slide.

13:05.739 --> 13:07.866
Do what you need to do.

13:07.908 --> 13:10.118
Be a big boy about it.

13:24.579 --> 13:25.717
Hello.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.469
Hey, honey.

13:27.511 --> 13:28.720
Oh, hey, Dad.

13:29.250 --> 13:30.388
I'm not offended at all

13:30.430 --> 13:32.307
that you thought I needed
a babysitter all weekend.

13:32.349 --> 13:34.100
- Yeah, whatever.
- Hi, Billy.

13:34.142 --> 13:37.103
- Tell Brittany hey.
- He says hi.

13:37.592 --> 13:40.899
- So how's your romantic getaway?
- Oh, it's all right so far.

13:40.941 --> 13:43.193
- Wear a condom!
- Ew.

13:43.235 --> 13:44.778
Tell her, "Why start now?
Ruin my record."

13:44.819 --> 13:46.655
- Gross.
- Anyway,

13:46.696 --> 13:48.490
I don't have cell service down here,

13:48.532 --> 13:50.909
so I'm on this satellite phone.
Just in case you need something,

13:50.951 --> 13:52.244
I want to give you the number, all right?

13:52.285 --> 13:53.662
- Now, you got a pen?
- Yeah, go ahead.

13:53.703 --> 13:56.623
Okay. Hang on.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.974
Are you enjoying your romantic getaway?

14:27.177 --> 14:29.471
Why did you make me bring him here?

14:29.739 --> 14:31.741
We needed to keep him away from Julio.

14:31.783 --> 14:34.077
If that's your reason, I could
have taken him anywhere.

14:34.119 --> 14:38.081
Also, given his reputation,
I wanted to meet him.

14:38.123 --> 14:40.208
I expected someone with a little more...

14:40.250 --> 14:42.002
with more personality, no?

14:43.670 --> 14:46.202
I've made peace with Julio.
That was your choice.

14:48.174 --> 14:50.218
But I care about Billy.

14:50.260 --> 14:52.554
Give me your word
that you will treat him well.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.561
I don't appreciate how you
flaunt him in front of me.

14:57.851 --> 14:59.811
He's a good man, Gabriel.

14:59.853 --> 15:01.730
And I need him.

15:01.771 --> 15:03.481
For what?

15:03.523 --> 15:04.858
For your campaign?

15:06.568 --> 15:08.194
For many things.

15:15.118 --> 15:16.870
Are you in love with him?

15:24.002 --> 15:25.491
You're a fool.

15:26.212 --> 15:28.202
In love with a fantasy.

15:29.257 --> 15:31.051
Do you think he would love you
if he knew who you really are?

15:31.092 --> 15:32.790
- Be nice.
- Or what?

15:35.055 --> 15:37.599
Or I won't give you my city.

15:39.684 --> 15:41.895
You've been away so long,
you've turned into a gringa.

15:46.399 --> 15:47.859
You forget who I am,

15:47.901 --> 15:49.349
Claudia.

15:53.355 --> 15:55.229
Don't call me that.

16:42.956 --> 16:45.500
Fuck did you find this place?

16:47.252 --> 16:49.713
So...

16:51.756 --> 16:53.758
No one else is here.

16:56.374 --> 16:58.054
I don't have my gun.

16:58.376 --> 17:00.849
Okay.

17:01.629 --> 17:03.393
Let's just get this over with.

17:03.435 --> 17:05.395
What are you talking about, man?

17:05.436 --> 17:06.938
I know you know.

17:07.510 --> 17:10.108
That's why I chose this spot.

17:10.471 --> 17:11.943
Make it easier on you.

17:12.473 --> 17:14.738
You won't get caught.

17:15.435 --> 17:18.407
Mary gets a bigger payout if I'm dead.

17:18.450 --> 17:20.910
Why the fuck would you do this, man?

17:20.952 --> 17:23.621
Oh, come on. Fuck you, Danny.

17:23.663 --> 17:25.498
- You put me in this position.
- No, no, no! Don't give me

17:25.540 --> 17:27.083
- that fucking shit! No, no, no!
- I had no choice.

17:27.125 --> 17:28.585
You're a grown fucking man!

17:28.626 --> 17:30.128
You made your own fucking decisions!

17:30.170 --> 17:33.256
Do not pin this on me.

17:36.831 --> 17:39.804
Why you? Huh?

17:40.501 --> 17:42.056
Why'd he send you?

17:42.098 --> 17:43.308
I volunteered, you fucking prick.

17:43.349 --> 17:44.517
The fuck you did.

17:44.559 --> 17:46.299
You're too weak.

17:47.520 --> 17:49.481
- Tom owns you.
- Fuck you.

17:49.522 --> 17:51.316
- Tom didn't fucking turn on me.
- Not yet.

17:51.971 --> 17:53.818
You better hope
you can pull that trigger.

17:53.860 --> 17:55.487
You think I'm a pussy? Huh?

17:55.528 --> 17:58.436
- You don't think I can do it?
- I wish.

17:59.562 --> 18:01.284
I want you to.

18:02.398 --> 18:05.955
That way, Mary never finds out
what the fuck we've done.

18:06.736 --> 18:09.447
And I don't have to rat out
my best friend.

18:12.575 --> 18:16.132
Just make sure nothing happens
to her and the kids. Okay?

18:18.414 --> 18:20.345
That's the least you can do.

18:52.323 --> 18:54.295
I'm gonna turn around.

18:54.337 --> 18:56.756
Fuck.

18:56.798 --> 18:59.384
You help us both out.

19:55.189 --> 19:56.900
Hey.

19:56.941 --> 19:59.527
- Hey, you found me.
- Yeah, finally.

19:59.569 --> 20:02.101
It's a big fucking joint.

20:03.323 --> 20:06.367
My God, this bathrobe, I...

20:06.409 --> 20:08.578
It was so big for me when I was little,

20:08.620 --> 20:10.401
but I loved it.

20:11.205 --> 20:14.626
I loved feeling cozy in it.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.627
What's wrong?

20:26.930 --> 20:28.514
Is that your diary?

20:28.556 --> 20:30.975
You don't want me to see
your baby diary, do you?

20:31.017 --> 20:33.716
No, it's just, uh...

20:35.134 --> 20:37.273
It's a book my brother did for me.

20:37.315 --> 20:38.608
Nice.

20:38.650 --> 20:40.516
- It's our story.
- Really?

20:40.557 --> 20:42.850
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, that's cool. Hmm.

20:43.446 --> 20:46.699
Well, looks like a pretty good
little artist when he was a kid.

20:49.702 --> 20:51.496
Well, she fell down.

20:53.944 --> 20:55.500
The hell is that?

20:55.821 --> 20:59.504
That's a little dark for a kid
to be drawing, isn't it?

21:04.467 --> 21:06.374
My parents were murdered.

21:10.431 --> 21:11.837
I'm sorry.

21:13.130 --> 21:14.519
I, uh...

21:14.560 --> 21:16.270
I was very little.

21:16.550 --> 21:20.483
And I came here and lived
with Gabriel's family.

21:20.525 --> 21:22.390
They adopted me.

21:22.986 --> 21:25.518
He became my brother and protected me.

21:25.796 --> 21:28.324
I see. Sorry, I didn't mean
to make light of that.

21:28.366 --> 21:29.784
I didn't, I didn't know.

21:29.826 --> 21:31.327
- No.
- You know, you never said anything.

21:31.369 --> 21:33.329
Just don't love to talk about it.

21:33.371 --> 21:35.331
Yeah, I don't blame you. Sorry.

21:38.126 --> 21:40.753
Hey. Oh, you found the book.

21:40.795 --> 21:43.548
You know, I made that for her
before she left to America.

21:43.589 --> 21:45.258
Yeah, she said.

21:46.122 --> 21:47.990
She left it behind.

21:48.032 --> 21:51.055
- I didn't leave it behind.
- You "forgot" it.

21:51.097 --> 21:52.723
You forgot who you are.

21:52.764 --> 21:54.267
No, I haven't forgotten.

21:54.308 --> 21:56.394
Why do you care if it's here?

21:57.478 --> 21:59.397
You know, Billy, um, Marisol and I,

21:59.439 --> 22:01.399
we used to share this bed as children.

22:02.513 --> 22:04.777
She used to be scared of the dark.

22:04.819 --> 22:07.391
- Yeah, I still am.
- Mm.

22:07.432 --> 22:09.907
We shared this bed...
you're gonna hate me

22:09.949 --> 22:11.409
for telling this story...
we shared this bed

22:11.451 --> 22:13.202
until the night Marisol
got her first period.

22:13.244 --> 22:14.746
- Okay. We are done.
- She was freaking out

22:14.787 --> 22:17.331
because she thought
she was dying, of course.

22:17.373 --> 22:19.208
The blood coming out of her.

22:19.250 --> 22:21.127
And then I was just in-in shock

22:21.169 --> 22:22.879
- because I didn't know what to do.
- Mm-hmm.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.589
You were gonna show me the town, right?

22:24.630 --> 22:26.591
Yes, let's go. Let's go.

22:34.348 --> 22:36.559
Billy's a grown man, right?

22:47.570 --> 22:49.989
Your brother's an interesting character.

22:50.031 --> 22:52.742
Yeah, you are being polite.

22:52.784 --> 22:55.495
No, it's just being home.

22:56.025 --> 22:57.622
Yeah.

22:57.663 --> 23:00.875
I haven't been back
to my home in... Oh, God.

23:00.917 --> 23:03.669
That was when...
I'll probably never go back.

23:03.711 --> 23:05.546
You see the lazo?

23:06.243 --> 23:09.133
That represents their everlasting union.

23:09.175 --> 23:10.843
They're bound forever.

23:10.885 --> 23:12.595
Yup.

23:12.637 --> 23:14.222
Hey, buddy.

23:14.263 --> 23:16.140
I'll distract her. You-you make
a run for it, all right?

23:16.182 --> 23:18.267
- Gracias, gracias.
- Yeah, yeah.

23:18.309 --> 23:20.103
- Billy. Don't ruin their wedding day.
- What?

23:20.144 --> 23:22.355
Well, he didn't know what
I was talking about, anyway.

24:46.022 --> 24:47.595
It's taken care of.

24:48.316 --> 24:50.014
All of them.

24:50.776 --> 24:52.778
No, I did it.

25:13.049 --> 25:15.331
Hey, you know the sister over there?

25:18.137 --> 25:20.139
I think so.

25:23.923 --> 25:25.186
Do you pray?

25:25.549 --> 25:26.646
Oh, God, no.

25:26.687 --> 25:28.648
I'm sorry.

25:28.689 --> 25:31.317
No, I-I wish. I don't pray.

25:31.359 --> 25:32.902
So...

25:32.944 --> 25:36.155
Why don't I just wait outside
for you, okay?

25:36.197 --> 25:38.950
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Take your time.

26:37.758 --> 26:39.427
It's good to see you, Sister.

26:40.082 --> 26:42.471
You are not welcome in the house of God.

26:43.973 --> 26:46.642
Get out of here!

26:46.684 --> 26:48.811
You disgrace me!

26:48.853 --> 26:50.217
Get out!

26:51.355 --> 26:53.733
See? That's what I'm saying.
They're trying to fuck me up

26:53.774 --> 26:55.651
with a confidential warrant
for some weed?

26:55.693 --> 26:57.695
Motherfuckers are getting
licenses to sell this shit.

26:57.737 --> 27:00.656
- I've got a weed card.
- Dude, you asked me to get JT here,

27:00.698 --> 27:01.991
and he's here, so chill. Let him do

27:02.033 --> 27:03.492
- his work, okay?
- Yeah, I wanted him because

27:03.534 --> 27:05.494
he helped my cousin and he
knows what the fuck he's doing.

27:05.536 --> 27:07.663
- I don't know you.
- All right, if you don't need me here,

27:07.705 --> 27:08.998
- then whatever.
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:09.040 --> 27:10.583
I apologize, okay?

27:10.624 --> 27:12.585
I respect you.

27:13.365 --> 27:15.117
Give him the fucking phone.

27:18.537 --> 27:20.092
I'm listening.

27:20.134 --> 27:21.927
How does this snitch shit work?

27:21.969 --> 27:24.769
'Cause I heard about
some shit that's going down.

27:24.811 --> 27:26.932
Not here, but I know where.

27:26.974 --> 27:28.559
Some... kid.

27:29.048 --> 27:30.770
Could I get a deal for that?

27:31.759 --> 27:33.773
That depends.

27:33.814 --> 27:35.929
Let's hear what you got.

27:36.650 --> 27:38.694
- A plantano?
- A plátano.

27:38.736 --> 27:40.696
- That's a banana, isn't it?
- Uh-huh.

27:40.738 --> 27:42.326
- Yeah?
- You're picking up

27:42.351 --> 27:44.932
a lot of Spanish here very quickly.

27:44.973 --> 27:46.660
Well, now, that one I heard before.

27:46.702 --> 27:48.704
We used to make jokes about that one.

27:48.746 --> 27:51.123
- About plátanos?
- Yeah.

27:51.165 --> 27:53.125
I-I had a friend from...

27:53.167 --> 27:54.752
- Señora Silva.
- Yes?

27:58.339 --> 27:59.673
- The campaign.
- Oh.

27:59.715 --> 28:01.133
- Uh-huh.
- I hope it's good news.

28:01.175 --> 28:03.010
I hope so. It might take a while.

28:03.052 --> 28:05.388
- That's all right. Take your time.
- Good.

28:18.859 --> 28:20.820
- Hey, Billy.
- Hey, what's up?

28:20.861 --> 28:22.655
- You like the town?
- Yeah, yeah.

28:22.696 --> 28:24.532
I didn't get to see much, but yeah, sure.

28:24.573 --> 28:26.784
- Yeah, it's a nice town.
- Yeah.

28:26.826 --> 28:29.328
They're very poor,
but, um... good people.

28:29.370 --> 28:30.651
Yeah, I'm sure.

28:31.735 --> 28:33.582
Do you know what I do, Billy?

28:34.863 --> 28:37.128
To tell you the truth,
she didn't tell me about you.

28:37.169 --> 28:39.130
Really? Oh, that's strange.

28:39.171 --> 28:40.688
We're very close, you know.

28:40.730 --> 28:42.842
Well, she's, uh,
she's a little secretive.

28:42.883 --> 28:45.094
She tends to keep things
under her hat, you know?

28:45.136 --> 28:48.305
Mm. Would you like me
to show you around the property?

28:48.347 --> 28:49.640
Yeah, sure.

28:49.682 --> 28:51.235
Ah, let's go. Please, after you.

28:51.277 --> 28:52.726
Thanks.

28:54.842 --> 28:56.480
Ah, look at this.

28:56.522 --> 28:59.066
Very bad year for the Cabernet grapes.

28:59.721 --> 29:01.351
You know much about wine, Billy?

29:01.392 --> 29:02.945
No, I don't know shit about wine.

29:02.987 --> 29:04.905
Ah, you're more of a bourbon man, huh?

29:04.947 --> 29:07.074
- Yeah, exactly.
- I respect that.

29:07.116 --> 29:09.160
Oh, please, don't-don't mind them.

29:11.775 --> 29:14.290
So, look, I got a question about Marisol.

29:14.331 --> 29:15.708
Okay.

29:15.749 --> 29:17.656
What happened to her parents?

29:18.335 --> 29:20.588
Ah, it's very sad.

29:20.629 --> 29:24.258
Her parents owed money
to the cartel, and...

29:24.300 --> 29:27.470
they couldn't pay,
so they paid with their lives.

29:27.511 --> 29:29.889
- Which cartel?
- Oh, they're long gone.

29:30.377 --> 29:31.891
It's a very peaceful town now.

29:31.932 --> 29:33.392
Yeah, I can see.

29:33.434 --> 29:35.394
Pretty good at keeping the peace there.

29:35.436 --> 29:37.938
- Well, some people want what I have.
- Yeah.

29:42.818 --> 29:44.069
Billy. Billy, Eduardo.

29:44.111 --> 29:46.113
- How you doing?
- Hola.

29:46.155 --> 29:48.199
Eduardo's been working for
the family for a very long time.

29:48.240 --> 29:50.326
- Sí, sí.
- Uh, he's a very loyal man.

29:56.249 --> 29:58.584
I'm also a surgeon, Billy.

29:58.626 --> 30:00.085
No. No. No, no, no.

30:07.593 --> 30:10.095
Yeah, nice to meet you.

30:10.137 --> 30:12.473
You're the first
hobby surgeon I ever met.

30:12.515 --> 30:16.060
Ah, it's a poor town.
I'm the only surgeon around.

30:16.673 --> 30:18.812
Feel like, uh,
like it's my duty, you know?

30:18.854 --> 30:20.244
- Hmm.
- Would you like to

30:20.269 --> 30:21.428
see my operation room?

30:21.470 --> 30:23.275
It's, uh, very state-of-the-art.

30:23.317 --> 30:25.236
Uh...

30:25.277 --> 30:28.322
- things like that kind of creep me out.
- Hmm.

30:28.769 --> 30:31.367
I probably better get back to the gal.

30:32.064 --> 30:33.911
She's a complicated woman.

30:33.953 --> 30:36.705
Yeah. She ain't your average bear.

30:36.747 --> 30:40.133
I think, Billy, you're in
a honeymoon phase with her.

30:40.714 --> 30:42.878
She's not a woman
who can be controlled, you know.

30:43.742 --> 30:45.994
You ever met one that could be?

30:48.676 --> 30:51.416
What exactly are your intentions
with my sister?

30:54.044 --> 30:55.391
My intentions?

30:55.432 --> 30:56.797
Mm-hmm.

30:57.393 --> 30:59.353
Well, not that it's anybody's business,

30:59.395 --> 31:01.230
but I don't have any specific intentions.

31:01.272 --> 31:03.107
I just kind of watch and wait.

31:05.548 --> 31:08.141
She's grown. So am I.

31:12.621 --> 31:14.326
Thanks for the tour.

31:14.368 --> 31:16.495
Of course.

31:16.858 --> 31:18.497
They're not gonna shoot me, are they?

31:18.539 --> 31:21.333
No. No. Please.

31:21.375 --> 31:22.960
- All right.
- I'm not a monster.

31:27.214 --> 31:29.633
- Step.
- Yeah, watch out.

31:31.260 --> 31:32.720
All right.

31:51.189 --> 31:52.243
All right, I'll be there in a second.

31:52.268 --> 31:53.490
- Give me a minute.
- Hey.

31:53.532 --> 31:55.784
I've been trying to call Billy.
I can't get him.

31:55.826 --> 31:57.244
What the fuck happened?

31:57.286 --> 31:59.663
Someone got to Roman and his family.

31:59.705 --> 32:00.998
What about the kids?

32:02.166 --> 32:03.876
Jesus Christ.

32:04.448 --> 32:06.295
Wha... What about the cop
that was watching him?

32:06.337 --> 32:07.880
They got to him, too.

32:07.921 --> 32:09.548
I mean, how does this fucking happen?

32:09.590 --> 32:11.008
Someone knew what they were doing.

32:11.050 --> 32:12.384
That's how this fucking happens.

32:12.426 --> 32:13.850
So what does this mean for Julio now?

32:13.892 --> 32:15.297
I'm gonna run it by the D.A.

32:15.339 --> 32:17.109
No promises, but I'm gonna
recommend we drop the charges.

32:17.151 --> 32:18.891
Yeah, but we don't have
Roman's testimony...

32:18.932 --> 32:21.352
Yes, I heard enough to know
that the kid didn't kill anyone.

32:21.393 --> 32:25.122
But whatever this is,
it's beyond Julio. Excuse me.

32:25.163 --> 32:26.231
Yeah?

32:30.125 --> 32:31.224
Hey.

32:33.880 --> 32:35.145
Just tell me, was this the cartel?

32:35.186 --> 32:36.283
We don't know for sure.

32:36.772 --> 32:39.465
But if it is the cartel...
and I'm speculating... but if...

32:39.506 --> 32:41.130
What do you mean you're speculating?

32:41.139 --> 32:43.469
If it was the cartel, once someone flips

32:43.494 --> 32:45.368
and they're taken out, it's over.

32:45.393 --> 32:47.133
Okay?

32:47.920 --> 32:49.880
Yeah, okay, right.

32:49.922 --> 32:51.453
Patty, look...

32:53.724 --> 32:54.923
Hey, this is Billy.

32:54.964 --> 32:56.887
- Leave a message.
- Fuck.

33:00.974 --> 33:03.435
Hi, Denise. This is Patty.

33:03.477 --> 33:05.020
Yeah, been a long time.

33:05.062 --> 33:07.135
Listen, I'm trying
to get ahold of your dad.

33:08.399 --> 33:10.984
He's where? Why?

33:11.932 --> 33:14.279
Never mind. Ju...

33:14.321 --> 33:16.436
Yes, text me the number.

33:16.478 --> 33:18.325
No, everything's fine. Everything's fine.

33:18.367 --> 33:22.329
Just, if-if you get ahold of
him, okay, tell him to call me.

33:22.371 --> 33:24.820
Okay, thank you. Bye. Bye.

33:26.333 --> 33:27.668
Damn it.

33:27.710 --> 33:29.795
- I'm sorry, okay?
- It's fine.

33:29.837 --> 33:32.881
- This is not your fault.
- I don't think it's my fault.

33:32.923 --> 33:34.883
Can I give you a ride home?

33:34.925 --> 33:36.873
I have my car, thank you.

33:38.375 --> 33:40.502
Hi, I'm calling for Billy McBride.

33:41.432 --> 33:43.267
Billy McBride.

34:01.410 --> 34:04.151
Play that pretty song you played before.

34:24.219 --> 34:25.505
The fuck are you?

34:25.547 --> 34:28.061
I'm JT. I'm a friend of Billy's.

34:28.103 --> 34:30.092
I'm sorry I startled you.

34:31.356 --> 34:32.804
Okay, yeah.

34:34.556 --> 34:37.070
- So, what, can I help you?
- Well, I hope so.

34:37.112 --> 34:39.072
I'm looking for Billy.

34:39.114 --> 34:42.309
There's, uh...
there's something going on.

34:42.350 --> 34:44.453
Well, he's not here. He's in Mexico,

34:44.495 --> 34:46.277
and apparently he'll be back tomorrow.

34:46.320 --> 34:47.670
This won't wait.

34:47.713 --> 34:49.197
Well, I don't know what to tell you

34:49.239 --> 34:50.751
'cause I've been trying
to get ahold of him, too.

34:52.032 --> 34:53.670
It's Julio.

34:54.659 --> 34:56.799
I-I think he's in trouble.

34:56.840 --> 34:59.635
- What do you mean?
- I don't know exactly.

34:59.676 --> 35:02.000
It could be nothing, but, uh...

35:02.596 --> 35:04.503
I don't want to chance it.

35:33.252 --> 35:35.546
Señora, like I said, Mr. McBride
is not in at the moment.

35:35.587 --> 35:38.293
I'll take the message for you. Okay?

35:38.334 --> 35:41.260
Yes, Patty S.D. Patty S.P.

35:41.301 --> 35:44.388
Uh, emergency at home.

35:44.429 --> 35:48.058
Okay. Yes.

35:48.100 --> 35:50.602
I'll make sure he gets it.

35:50.644 --> 35:52.646
Adios.

35:55.148 --> 35:57.658
Listen, he was right about Tito.

35:57.699 --> 35:59.678
We have to get the kid
released immediately.

35:59.719 --> 36:01.670
Okay, let me see if I can
get Wallace on the phone.

36:01.712 --> 36:03.073
Or whatever judge is available.

36:03.115 --> 36:04.491
- It doesn't matter.
- Okay, listen.

36:04.533 --> 36:06.827
Wallace knows the case, and she knows JT.

36:06.869 --> 36:08.203
- She's our best bet.
- Fuck. Fine.

36:08.245 --> 36:09.538
Just please hurry, okay?

36:09.580 --> 36:12.207
Fuck you!

36:15.282 --> 36:17.075
Why did you bring me here?

36:22.175 --> 36:24.833
I just thought we needed to get away.

36:25.929 --> 36:28.473
You just seem kind of
uncomfortable with your brother

36:28.515 --> 36:31.351
and your memories and all that.

36:35.814 --> 36:38.609
I wanted you to know who I am.

36:40.611 --> 36:42.613
Where I'm from.

36:46.658 --> 36:49.524
And my life is not perfect.

36:50.942 --> 36:53.373
Whose life is perfect?

39:13.388 --> 39:15.766
What are you doing? Enough!

39:15.807 --> 39:18.060
What are you doing, Claudia?

39:21.271 --> 39:23.190
That's my robe!

39:25.192 --> 39:27.110
I wasn't finished!

39:28.111 --> 39:29.821
You're an animal.

39:29.863 --> 39:31.990
Cover yourself.

39:33.283 --> 39:34.951
Now you know how I feel.

39:42.375 --> 39:44.086
Sit with me.

39:46.088 --> 39:47.744
Sit down, Clau.

39:50.342 --> 39:51.831
Please.

40:06.653 --> 40:09.948
The lawyer will find out
you're lying, then what?

40:12.447 --> 40:14.282
You think about the future of others,

40:14.324 --> 40:16.409
but can't see the future
for yourself, Claudia.

40:27.462 --> 40:30.257
I will always be here for you, Claudia.

40:35.262 --> 40:38.014
You know what needs to be done.

40:48.984 --> 40:50.902
I don't want anything to happen to him.

40:55.991 --> 40:57.784
Eh.

40:57.826 --> 40:59.911
Shh.

40:59.953 --> 41:02.205
Clau,

41:02.247 --> 41:04.416
nothing's happened yet.

41:06.126 --> 41:08.962
I know this guy, he'll never let it go.

41:09.004 --> 41:12.215
I don't have to do it myself.

41:15.594 --> 41:19.472
We can do it simple. Easy.

41:19.514 --> 41:22.267
I'll hire outside people,
it won't trace back to us.

41:28.190 --> 41:30.358
Just say the word.

42:24.621 --> 42:26.623
Do you mind if I sit?

42:44.140 --> 42:46.172
Are you going somewhere?

42:46.768 --> 42:50.730
No, I'm just-just gonna ride the rails.

42:52.565 --> 42:54.526
Look at some sky.

42:55.431 --> 42:57.529
You're worried about Billy.

42:57.570 --> 42:59.572
He'll blame himself.

43:00.812 --> 43:02.951
I know I did.

43:03.523 --> 43:05.900
We can be pretty hard on ourselves.

43:07.193 --> 43:09.249
- Even you?
- Even me.

43:13.449 --> 43:15.880
You know, there ought to be
an investigation into the death

43:15.922 --> 43:18.416
- of the Suarez kid.
- He wrote out his confession.

43:18.458 --> 43:20.302
That's bullshit and you know it.

43:20.343 --> 43:21.886
Until someone opens an investigation

43:21.928 --> 43:23.722
and that case crosses my desk...

43:23.763 --> 43:25.169
Enough.

43:27.922 --> 43:31.062
This is exactly why
I can't do this anymore.

43:33.064 --> 43:35.066
Well, I wish you could.

43:37.402 --> 43:39.404
'Cause we miss you.

43:42.157 --> 43:43.688
I'm around.

45:14.457 --> 45:16.751
I had a dream about us last night.

45:16.793 --> 45:19.087
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

45:19.129 --> 45:20.910
What kind of dream?

45:24.551 --> 45:26.666
That we were married.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.807
- Really?
- Is that crazy?

45:31.212 --> 45:33.393
I've heard crazier things.

45:41.651 --> 45:43.224
I...

45:46.769 --> 45:49.826
I want you to tell me that you love me.

45:53.734 --> 45:55.165
Okay.

45:57.333 --> 45:59.335
You go first.

46:00.825 --> 46:02.535
I do.

46:03.578 --> 46:05.288
I love you.

46:15.131 --> 46:17.270
Señor McBride.

46:17.592 --> 46:20.190
There's a urgent phone call
for you from a Patty...

46:20.231 --> 46:22.400
- I really didn't get her last name.
- Yeah, yeah.

46:22.442 --> 46:24.527
Okay. I know who it is.

46:24.569 --> 46:27.363
All right, sweetie, we'll
continue this conversation?

46:27.405 --> 46:29.395
- Yeah.
- All right. Sorry.

46:29.699 --> 46:32.648
She's got shitty timing. She always has.

46:35.121 --> 46:37.123
Thanks, buddy.
