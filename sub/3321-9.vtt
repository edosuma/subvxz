WEBVTT

01:26.200 --> 01:29.113
Send a rider tonight
and he'll be back by morning.

01:29.200 --> 01:32.352
Why don't they let
us dry ourselves and get warm?

01:33.160 --> 01:35.436
If I stay like this,
I will rust.

01:35.520 --> 01:37.796
What kind of fellow
is this Jarl Borg?

01:38.840 --> 01:41.912
This is no way
to treat guests,
whoever they are.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.310
Especially if they've been
traveling for days on end.

02:03.360 --> 02:05.920
Are you the emissaries
from King Horik?

02:07.880 --> 02:09.678
Well, I can tell you at once,
you're wasting your time.

02:09.759 --> 02:13.390
It's my land,
and I want it
returned to me.

02:13.480 --> 02:14.880
That's all I have to say.

02:15.520 --> 02:17.273
He wants to
make peace with you

02:17.360 --> 02:21.149
and come to some
kind of agreement.

02:21.240 --> 02:23.880
Then tell him if
he leaves my land,
we can have peace.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.239
But not before.

02:30.920 --> 02:34.311
How can you make
peace, Jarl Borg,

02:34.400 --> 02:36.551
if you insist on
humiliating him?

02:36.680 --> 02:38.717
If I invade and defeat him,

02:38.800 --> 02:41.554
will he not be
even more humiliated?

02:41.680 --> 02:42.955
Not if he fights well.

02:44.680 --> 02:45.796
In any case,

02:46.720 --> 02:50.031
I am sure that
he would relish a fight.

03:04.120 --> 03:05.236
What's your name?

03:07.280 --> 03:08.760
Ragnar Lothbrok.

03:10.120 --> 03:12.077
You are Ragnar Lothbrok,

03:13.040 --> 03:14.633
the one who sailed west?

03:16.440 --> 03:18.352
I am surprised that
you've heard about that.

03:21.160 --> 03:22.913
How are you surprised?

03:23.960 --> 03:25.872
Everyone has heard
of your exploits.

03:33.400 --> 03:36.837
Why have we not offered
our guests dry
clothes and food?

03:37.320 --> 03:39.118
Treat these folk well.

03:39.200 --> 03:42.796
Give them ale,
let them dry out, feed them.

03:42.960 --> 03:46.158
Tomorrow, you and I
will talk again,
Ragnar Lothbrok.

04:11.560 --> 04:13.517
You haven't
eaten in three days.

04:28.280 --> 04:29.760
You see?

04:33.200 --> 04:34.793
I have fears.

04:39.040 --> 04:40.793
Go to the Seer,

04:40.880 --> 04:43.349
ask if your fears
will come true.

04:43.520 --> 04:45.830
It's sometimes better
not to know one's fate.

04:48.520 --> 04:50.557
I take it,
from what you said yesterday,

04:50.640 --> 04:52.279
that King Horik is
prepared to compromise

04:52.360 --> 04:55.751
and offer some deal
regarding those lands of mine,

04:55.840 --> 04:57.274
which he still occupies?

04:57.400 --> 04:58.914
He is prepared
to pay you

04:59.000 --> 05:01.117
to renounce
your illegal claims

05:01.560 --> 05:02.880
of his lands.

05:02.960 --> 05:04.917
You disappoint me now,
Ragnar Lothbrok.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.878
I thought you'd come here
with a serious purpose.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.315
If you would just
name your price.

05:08.440 --> 05:09.715
The land is priceless.

05:11.080 --> 05:13.640
Which is why King Horik
wants to keep it for himself.

05:13.720 --> 05:17.396
Every piece of
land has a price,
just like every human.

05:17.480 --> 05:19.153
Well, you
don't understand.

05:19.240 --> 05:21.277
This is not
a small plot of land

05:21.400 --> 05:23.471
on which you grow
turnips and onions.

05:23.560 --> 05:25.313
We're talking about
a vast swathe of land,

05:25.400 --> 05:29.394
and on this land,
in the earth, are minerals,
things of great value.

05:29.480 --> 05:32.359
Why else would I
assert my claim?

05:32.440 --> 05:34.636
King Horik resists
your claim,

05:34.720 --> 05:37.599
but still, in good faith,

05:37.680 --> 05:39.672
he is willing to
settle with you.

05:39.760 --> 05:42.150
If you will name
a reasonable price.

05:44.360 --> 05:47.512
At the moment,
my price is King Horik's head.

05:50.440 --> 05:51.635
Well, then,

05:52.600 --> 05:54.034
it seems I am done.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.757
Hold on,
please, sit down,
sit down.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.957
Let's see if we can
find another way.

06:01.880 --> 06:03.360
What do you
have in mind?

06:03.440 --> 06:05.238
What if my claim
was acknowledged,

06:05.320 --> 06:06.800
but I was willing
to lease the land

06:06.920 --> 06:08.354
back to the King
during his lifetime?

06:08.960 --> 06:11.714
Or what if we deferred
judgment on ownership,

06:11.800 --> 06:13.598
but shared
the mineral rights?

06:15.640 --> 06:17.552
What do you say?

06:17.640 --> 06:19.313
Can we start negotiating
in this manner?

06:23.160 --> 06:24.958
Why not?

06:27.800 --> 06:30.360
I have not been
given the authority to

06:30.800 --> 06:33.679
negotiate in this manner.

06:33.760 --> 06:36.798
You mean King Horik
sent you here with
nothing but a demand?

06:38.160 --> 06:40.072
And yet he speaks of peace!

06:40.920 --> 06:43.116
I don't know
what is in his mind.

06:43.240 --> 06:45.152
Well, then,
maybe you should ask him.

06:50.680 --> 06:52.000
Let me make a suggestion.

06:52.640 --> 06:54.074
Why don't you send
one of your men back

06:54.160 --> 06:57.039
so he can put to King Horik
my ideas for a remedy?

06:57.320 --> 06:58.834
If you think
that will work.

06:58.920 --> 07:01.640
Good. Your messenger
will take several days.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.837
So, in the meantime,
why don't you and

07:04.000 --> 07:06.117
your men go and visit
our famous ash tree?

07:06.200 --> 07:07.839
It is famous not
only for its size,

07:08.000 --> 07:09.639
but because it
never loses its leaves,

07:09.720 --> 07:10.915
summer or winter.

07:11.960 --> 07:14.429
Some people even
say it's Yggdrasil,

07:14.520 --> 07:16.591
the tree that
holds up the sky.

07:16.680 --> 07:18.911
And I will
provide you an escort.

07:19.040 --> 07:21.032
I only have one
very small request.

07:21.120 --> 07:23.032
I would like one
of your men to stay

07:23.160 --> 07:25.038
behind here as
a kind of security.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.839
You understand, I hope?

07:33.040 --> 07:35.111
My brother Rollo
will stay behind.

07:43.120 --> 07:44.554
Floki!

07:56.960 --> 07:58.599
So how long
must we travel?

07:59.080 --> 08:01.640
It can take us three
days to reach the tree.

08:04.640 --> 08:06.393
It looks like rain.

08:10.560 --> 08:12.040
Come.

08:23.600 --> 08:24.875
Why have you come?

08:24.960 --> 08:27.714
I am frightened
for my husband.

08:27.800 --> 08:31.032
Do you think your husband
is in some kind of danger?

08:32.280 --> 08:35.717
I've had strange
and disturbing dreams.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.477
What happens in your dreams?

08:38.559 --> 08:41.394
Dark shapes come
to me at night.

08:42.440 --> 08:44.033
Monstrous forms.

08:44.960 --> 08:46.519
When I wake,

08:46.600 --> 08:48.671
they skulk in the
shadows, shapeless,

08:48.760 --> 08:52.913
but no sooner am I asleep
than they creep forward again.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.036
Ah, yes.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.434
The shadows come
from Hel's hall.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.800
No one can ensnare them,
not even the gods.

09:02.520 --> 09:04.477
What is it
that they want?

09:06.280 --> 09:07.760
To take something
from you.

09:08.680 --> 09:09.875
My life?

09:09.960 --> 09:13.749
No, something far more
important to you than that.

09:14.360 --> 09:15.919
My husband's life?

09:19.880 --> 09:21.280
Tell me.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.829
Why must you
all force me up

09:23.920 --> 09:26.116
and unearth me
to sorrows?

09:28.320 --> 09:30.471
Your husband is in danger,

09:30.560 --> 09:32.677
but not for his life.

09:33.400 --> 09:36.154
He is in danger
from the magical world.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.320
How?

09:43.120 --> 09:44.395
Answer me.

09:44.520 --> 09:47.479
I was unwilling to speak
and I will say no more now!

10:05.920 --> 10:07.957
So, Rollo,

10:08.040 --> 10:09.793
how do you get on
with your brother?

10:11.920 --> 10:13.479
We get along fine.

10:14.040 --> 10:15.679
Why shouldn't we?

10:17.080 --> 10:18.275
No reason.

10:18.360 --> 10:20.431
But not all brothers
get on so well.

10:20.520 --> 10:23.080
I know that from
personal experience.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.433
What do you mean?

10:26.840 --> 10:28.877
I, too, had a brother.

10:28.960 --> 10:30.679
I loved him.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.759
We were very close,
as befits blood brothers.

10:34.840 --> 10:36.559
We fought together
in the shield-wall.

10:36.640 --> 10:38.359
We shared the same women.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.432
When my father was
killed, there was

10:42.560 --> 10:44.552
fierce competition to
replace him as Jarl.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.393
And although I
was his eldest son,

10:46.480 --> 10:48.676
I was not sure I
was going to succeed.

10:49.720 --> 10:51.598
However,
I was elected
at the thing.

10:51.680 --> 10:53.876
We had a feast
to celebrate.

10:53.960 --> 10:55.553
My wife was there.

10:56.480 --> 10:58.358
My young, beautiful wife.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.680
We'd just gotten married.

11:02.080 --> 11:04.879
And all the others who had
stood for election against me.

11:07.760 --> 11:09.831
My brother poisoned them

11:11.120 --> 11:12.395
all.

11:13.720 --> 11:15.677
I only survived because

11:17.440 --> 11:19.511
my wife took the cup
I was about to drink from

11:19.600 --> 11:21.910
and drained it herself
in celebration.

11:24.040 --> 11:26.111
I will never
forget her screams.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.512
It's my wife's
screams that will

11:29.640 --> 11:31.597
haunt me for
the rest of my life.

11:35.320 --> 11:39.473
My brother
denied responsibility,
but his guilt was too obvious.

11:39.560 --> 11:42.553
So I blinded him
with my own hands,

11:42.680 --> 11:45.434
and then I burned him alive.

11:47.360 --> 11:49.716
Although he laughed
while he was burning.

11:55.120 --> 11:58.192
That's what I know about
the love between brothers.

12:02.240 --> 12:05.392
Ragnar would
never do such a thing.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.480
Of course not.

12:08.480 --> 12:10.631
No, your brother
is different.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.990
Your brother's a great man,

12:15.000 --> 12:17.117
a great warrior.

12:18.160 --> 12:19.799
As am I.

12:22.080 --> 12:23.560
I'm sure you are.

12:25.800 --> 12:27.996
And yet I've
never heard of you.

12:38.080 --> 12:39.070
Whoa.

12:40.400 --> 12:42.596
Our camp is set
up over here.

12:42.680 --> 12:45.275
There's some
excellent fishing upstream,
under the waterfall.

12:45.360 --> 12:47.113
I will go.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.112
And I also,

12:49.200 --> 12:51.192
for everybody knows...

12:51.320 --> 12:53.152
Three eyes are
better than one.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.472
You! Look away!

13:38.160 --> 13:39.560
Who are you?
Look away at once!

13:41.760 --> 13:43.399
What are we
supposed to
be looking at?

13:44.000 --> 13:46.390
I'm blind!
See? I can't
see anything!

13:51.880 --> 13:53.109
Arne!

13:53.200 --> 13:54.998
What? You're going
to try to kill us

13:55.080 --> 13:57.720
for protecting the
reputation of our mistress?

13:57.800 --> 13:58.995
Shame on you!

13:59.080 --> 14:01.549
We came upon your
mistress by chance.

14:02.760 --> 14:04.399
We are strangers here,

14:04.480 --> 14:07.234
traveling to
the great ash tree,
guests of Jarl Borg.

14:07.320 --> 14:10.313
Jarl Borg?
Then why didn't
you say so at once?

14:10.400 --> 14:13.199
We will just return
to our horses then.

14:18.440 --> 14:19.954
You spied on me.

14:24.920 --> 14:26.513
We meant no harm.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.956
They say they are
guests of Jarl Borg.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.713
Are you alone?

14:32.800 --> 14:35.190
We are traveling with
Earl Ragnar Lothbrok.

14:37.960 --> 14:41.510
Then I think Earl Ragnar owes
me an apology on your behalf.

14:42.560 --> 14:43.710
Don't you?

14:48.400 --> 14:50.232
I never knew that

14:50.880 --> 14:53.839
fresh fish was
also packed in salt.

14:55.800 --> 14:57.917
Listen, it's
not our fault.

14:58.040 --> 15:00.760
We just saw her
bathing. What were
we supposed to do?

15:02.000 --> 15:03.036
Fish.

15:03.120 --> 15:04.713
You did not see
her, Ragnar.

15:05.800 --> 15:07.678
So you get your
cheek slashed,

15:07.840 --> 15:10.560
and now I'm supposed
to apologize

15:10.680 --> 15:13.479
for you two staring
at a naked body?

15:14.480 --> 15:15.834
That's what she said.

15:16.720 --> 15:19.997
Who is she, anyway,
to put such a high price
on her nakedness?

15:20.080 --> 15:21.480
We didn't ask.

15:26.680 --> 15:27.796
I'm intrigued.

15:28.560 --> 15:29.994
What's so intriguing?

15:30.800 --> 15:33.235
Sometimes the gods put things
like this in front of us

15:33.320 --> 15:34.436
as some kind of test.

15:35.480 --> 15:37.517
She has set me a challenge

15:37.680 --> 15:39.194
and I am up to task.

15:39.320 --> 15:42.438
See, I'm less interested in
what you say is her beauty,

15:42.520 --> 15:44.193
than what I suspect
is her wit.

15:44.760 --> 15:46.114
So tell her,

15:46.200 --> 15:47.714
I invite her
here to join us.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.878
Neither dressed

15:50.960 --> 15:52.280
nor undressed.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.360
What else?

15:57.480 --> 16:00.552
Neither hungry nor full,

16:01.560 --> 16:05.236
neither in company nor alone.

16:07.760 --> 16:10.116
Can you remember
all of that, one eye?

16:14.240 --> 16:16.152
What did the
Seer tell you?

16:17.000 --> 16:20.072
He said that it's true,
that Ragnar is in danger.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.235
From whom?

16:24.920 --> 16:26.149
I don't know.

16:33.880 --> 16:35.109
Who do you think?

16:42.240 --> 16:44.436
I think he is in
danger from himself.

16:52.280 --> 16:53.839
Have you ever been
to Yggdrasil before?

16:53.960 --> 16:55.599
No.

17:06.480 --> 17:08.358
So, Earl Ragnar,

17:08.440 --> 17:10.511
I come to you
as you desired.

17:10.599 --> 17:12.990
Neither dressed
nor undressed,

17:13.079 --> 17:15.276
neither hungry nor full,

17:15.359 --> 17:17.795
neither alone
nor yet in company.

17:19.079 --> 17:21.037
Do I pass your test?

17:21.119 --> 17:22.395
I owe you an apology.

17:23.119 --> 17:24.634
I accept.

17:31.040 --> 17:35.114
Could I offer you some
horrible salted fish?

17:36.800 --> 17:38.234
I'm very tempted.

17:38.920 --> 17:41.116
You can get tired
of fresh fish.

17:44.720 --> 17:46.200
Come.

17:58.320 --> 17:59.834
Sit, please.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.200
May I ask your name?

18:05.160 --> 18:06.640
My name is Aslaug.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.435
We're on our way to
see the great ash tree.

18:11.760 --> 18:12.830
Of course.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.958
You are welcome to join us.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.274
Will you come along, Aslaug?

18:37.560 --> 18:38.630
Siggy, what is it?

18:38.800 --> 18:39.870
No, it's nothing.

18:44.040 --> 18:47.078
I visited my cousin
a few days ago.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.072
She had just buried
her young son.

18:50.160 --> 18:51.640
Why did he die?

18:54.600 --> 18:58.594
One day he was fine,
and the next,
he caught a fever that

18:58.680 --> 19:02.037
made him sweat and cry
out in the night,
and the next day,

19:03.560 --> 19:05.074
she put him in the ground.

20:06.360 --> 20:08.477
But if this
is Yggdrasil,

20:08.600 --> 20:10.159
then it must be the same tree

20:10.240 --> 20:13.278
that Lord Odin once
hanged himself from.

20:13.840 --> 20:14.910
Why not?

20:16.000 --> 20:17.798
All things are possible.

20:31.320 --> 20:37.078
"I hung from a windy
tree for nine long nights,

20:37.200 --> 20:38.714
"wounded by a spear,

20:38.840 --> 20:40.433
"dedicated to Odin,

20:41.280 --> 20:44.000
"from that tree of
which no man knows

20:44.480 --> 20:46.517
"from where its roots run."

21:00.160 --> 21:01.799
No, please.

21:03.160 --> 21:05.231
Look after my daughter

21:05.320 --> 21:06.310
first.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.793
It's all right.

21:34.280 --> 21:35.600
What's wrong, boy?

21:35.680 --> 21:36.716
What do you think?

21:37.000 --> 21:39.276
My father is making
a fool of himself.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.957
He's enjoying himself
in the company of
a beautiful woman.

21:42.040 --> 21:43.360
What's foolish
about that?

21:44.160 --> 21:45.879
Some day you'll
do the same thing.

21:45.960 --> 21:48.714
If Lagertha were here,
she'd cut his balls off.

21:48.800 --> 21:51.076
Then it's
a good thing she's not.

21:52.400 --> 21:53.959
Listen to me,
my friend.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.595
Your father and mother
are a famous couple.

21:56.680 --> 21:59.673
They love each other.
Everybody knows that.

21:59.760 --> 22:02.275
So don't begrudge your old man
a little harmless fun, huh?

22:30.760 --> 22:32.672
I trust all is to
your satisfaction.

22:34.160 --> 22:35.514
You feed me very well.

22:35.600 --> 22:36.875
You're an
important guest.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.233
We would like to
keep you entertained
until your brother returns.

22:43.760 --> 22:45.797
You always talk
about my brother.

22:45.880 --> 22:47.837
What choice do I have?

22:47.920 --> 22:49.593
He is your earl.

22:55.120 --> 22:56.918
Which one would
you like tonight?

22:58.960 --> 23:00.679
Why don't you
take both of them?

23:02.240 --> 23:04.152
I don't need to be
bribed with women.

23:09.360 --> 23:11.033
What is it you
want, Rollo?

23:13.600 --> 23:15.592
What is it you
really want?

23:23.640 --> 23:26.519
<i>Fenrir, the giant wolf,</i>

23:26.880 --> 23:29.952
could not be constrained
by any means known to man,

23:31.160 --> 23:33.436
so the dwarves forged a chain,

23:34.680 --> 23:36.911
but not from metal.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.630
Nothing made by man
could constrain Fenrir,

23:40.720 --> 23:43.315
so they forged it
from the things we cannot see

23:44.360 --> 23:46.033
and the things we cannot hear.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.310
Like the breath of a fish,

23:49.400 --> 23:51.790
the sound a moving cat makes.

23:52.360 --> 23:54.079
The roots

23:54.200 --> 23:55.600
of a mountain.

23:56.280 --> 23:57.316
You know?

23:59.040 --> 24:00.793
Of course I know!

24:00.880 --> 24:02.360
These things interest me!

24:03.400 --> 24:05.710
Like the terrible tricks
of the god Loki.

24:06.400 --> 24:09.916
How he turns into a flea
to divest the goddess Freyja

24:10.600 --> 24:12.034
of her precious necklace.

24:12.880 --> 24:15.236
He's only a distant ancestor.

24:21.520 --> 24:23.557
I came to ask
about Jarl Borg.

24:25.200 --> 24:26.475
He won't sell.

24:27.080 --> 24:28.560
He wants to make a deal.

24:29.560 --> 24:32.120
I'm not interested
in deals.

24:34.400 --> 24:36.471
That would make
it hard for Ragnar.

24:36.560 --> 24:39.632
Ragnar will come to
the right conclusion

24:39.880 --> 24:41.280
and make the
right decision.

24:42.560 --> 24:45.120
In any case, there is
someone else in Götland

24:45.520 --> 24:46.749
who looks after my affairs.

24:47.280 --> 24:49.715
Don't you care if
the negotiations fail?

24:53.320 --> 24:54.470
Look!

25:31.680 --> 25:33.353
I am going to die.

25:34.960 --> 25:37.998
No, you are not
going to die.

25:39.400 --> 25:42.040
The Seer might think that
he is the only one in Kattegat

25:42.120 --> 25:44.271
with the gift of prophecy,

25:45.480 --> 25:47.073
but he's wrong,

25:47.160 --> 25:49.550
and I know you are
not going to die.

25:55.400 --> 25:58.996
I should tell you the truth
about who I really am.

26:01.520 --> 26:03.477
I am Princess Aslaug.

26:03.560 --> 26:06.519
My mother was
the shield-maiden
Brunhilde.

26:09.800 --> 26:13.919
Everyone knows the renown
of your mother.

26:15.320 --> 26:16.834
But I am not her.

26:17.640 --> 26:19.199
I am myself.

26:20.360 --> 26:22.477
Both my parents
are dead now,

26:22.960 --> 26:24.997
and I did not
know them anyway.

26:25.320 --> 26:27.312
Why did you
come along with me?

26:28.880 --> 26:30.678
Because I had no choice.

26:44.080 --> 26:45.719
Why did you do that?

26:46.840 --> 26:48.513
Because I had no choice.

27:45.200 --> 27:46.714
I hate you.

27:47.880 --> 27:49.758
It's disgusting.

27:51.520 --> 27:53.000
I could not help myself.

27:53.080 --> 27:55.037
Shall I tell that
to Lagertha,

27:55.120 --> 27:56.156
your wife?

27:56.240 --> 27:57.799
If you want to.

27:59.600 --> 28:02.354
You cannot love her
that much after all,

28:02.440 --> 28:05.831
no matter what you say,
no matter what people think.

28:05.920 --> 28:08.151
I don't care
what people think.

28:09.040 --> 28:10.759
Of course I love
your mother.

28:18.680 --> 28:21.434
Swear to me that it
will not happen again.

28:28.480 --> 28:31.518
I swear to you it
won't happen again.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.673
I love you.

28:44.640 --> 28:45.960
Now, go play.

29:36.480 --> 29:37.960
No!

29:38.040 --> 29:39.474
No!

29:41.200 --> 29:43.874
No!

29:55.360 --> 29:56.874
Athelstan?

30:00.440 --> 30:03.353
He is so weak
he cannot eat.

30:04.800 --> 30:07.110
Pray to the gods,

30:07.240 --> 30:09.800
please, for him.

31:15.920 --> 31:17.434
Wait, no.

31:20.360 --> 31:21.953
I said no.

31:33.760 --> 31:35.319
No.

32:35.640 --> 32:36.710
Lord of lords,

32:37.520 --> 32:39.910
we make this offering to you,

32:40.000 --> 32:42.469
hoping you will
find it pleasing.

33:24.160 --> 33:26.038
Can you
try a little more?

33:39.480 --> 33:41.153
Gyda.

34:17.480 --> 34:19.039
Enjoy!

34:19.800 --> 34:21.154
What's wrong with you?

34:41.840 --> 34:43.478
I'm carrying your child.

34:49.800 --> 34:52.474
Did the Seer not
promise you more sons?

35:44.320 --> 35:45.310
Whoa.

35:57.440 --> 36:00.035
We welcome our
guests to this feast.

36:00.120 --> 36:02.589
Now tell us what you learned
from King Horik.

36:03.680 --> 36:06.434
What compromises is
he willing to make?

36:07.920 --> 36:09.752
Can I not eat first?

36:20.240 --> 36:21.799
Well, he said...

36:25.000 --> 36:26.639
What did he say?

36:33.960 --> 36:36.634
What did he say?

36:39.920 --> 36:41.877
He will make
no compromises,

36:42.840 --> 36:44.115
no deals.

36:44.720 --> 36:47.758
He say you must name
your price for the land.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.035
Or?

36:51.960 --> 36:53.952
He didn't say "or."

36:58.920 --> 37:01.196
It seems your mission
has been entirely wasted,

37:01.320 --> 37:02.959
Ragnar Lothbrok.

37:03.960 --> 37:06.475
You and your men
must leave here
in the morning.

37:08.920 --> 37:11.640
Unless you want to
repudiate King Horik,

37:13.000 --> 37:14.719
renounce your
allegiance to him?

37:24.400 --> 37:25.754
I see.

37:28.200 --> 37:29.475
Very well.

37:36.840 --> 37:38.160
Good.

37:40.160 --> 37:41.480
War.

39:09.080 --> 39:10.833
Odin.

39:59.640 --> 40:01.836
So, my friend,
the die is cast.

40:01.960 --> 40:03.474
King Horik has
left me no choice.

40:03.560 --> 40:06.837
I must attack him and claim
what is rightfully mine.

40:09.120 --> 40:12.477
Your brother will
clearly not support me,
but the question is,

40:12.560 --> 40:14.233
will you?

41:20.480 --> 41:22.836
Will you fight alongside me?

41:24.280 --> 41:27.159
Together, you and I can
carve out the new kingdom.

41:37.520 --> 41:39.989
<i>Isn't that what
you really want?</i>

41:41.400 --> 41:44.552
The death of your brother
and the start
of your own fame?

42:09.920 --> 42:11.673
Well, what do you say?

43:28.760 --> 43:30.353
I say yes.

43:35.080 --> 43:37.037
I will fight
with you.

43:40.080 --> 43:42.549
I will fight with you
against my brother.
