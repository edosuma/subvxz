WEBVTT

00:07.173 --> 00:10.130
Exactly what I wanted to get up
at 6:00 a.m. to do.

00:10.173 --> 00:13.173
I got 80 hours
community service

00:13.217 --> 00:14.826
for a bogus
shoplifting charge.

00:14.869 --> 00:16.304
How about you?
What'd you get?

00:16.347 --> 00:20.043
30... days.

00:20.086 --> 00:22.043
Oh.

00:22.086 --> 00:23.521
What'd you do?

00:27.304 --> 00:30.260
You hang out at the Cobra Room
on Tate Street?

00:30.304 --> 00:32.260
I assure you, never.

00:32.304 --> 00:34.304
I swear I've seen
you somewhere.

00:35.695 --> 00:37.652
I know who you are.

00:37.695 --> 00:39.652
Hey, you're the senator
that got busted,

00:39.695 --> 00:40.826
ordering up a hooker.

00:40.869 --> 00:42.173
Congressman.

00:42.217 --> 00:43.826
At least she was fly, though.

00:43.869 --> 00:46.391
Seen both of your
mug shots on TMZ.

00:46.434 --> 00:48.347
Congressman.

00:50.086 --> 00:52.043
Hey, boss!

00:52.086 --> 00:53.695
You better take a look at this.

01:33.304 --> 01:35.086
No, I didn't see
Delilah last night.

01:35.130 --> 01:36.304
I was home alone.

01:36.347 --> 01:37.739
Mm, everything
all right?

01:37.782 --> 01:39.347
Oh, yeah.

01:39.391 --> 01:41.347
Yeah, it's just, you know,
we spent a lot of time apart.

01:41.391 --> 01:43.000
There's a period
of adjustment.

01:43.043 --> 01:44.826
I remember my parents going
through the same thing

01:44.869 --> 01:47.217
when my father would come home
from a long deployment.

01:47.260 --> 01:49.260
But, to answer your question,
everything's just fine.

01:49.304 --> 01:51.652
Well, relationships take work.

01:51.695 --> 01:53.782
Morning, Timothy.

01:53.826 --> 01:55.782
'Sup, Bish?Hey.

01:55.826 --> 01:58.043
How are you two on this
spectacular spring morning?

01:58.086 --> 02:00.217
Wow, you're in
an abnormally good mood.

02:00.260 --> 02:01.521
What's up?

02:01.565 --> 02:02.956
My father called.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.347
He's taking the train down.

02:04.391 --> 02:05.782
Gonna have a little visit.

02:05.826 --> 02:07.347
Gonna stay with me
for a couple days.

02:07.391 --> 02:10.000
Ooh, and that's good?

02:10.043 --> 02:11.130
TONY:
I know what you're thinking.

02:11.173 --> 02:13.391
But yes, it's very good.

02:13.434 --> 02:16.000
Senior's back from his little
European wingding.

02:16.043 --> 02:17.826
He sounds rejuvenated.

02:17.869 --> 02:20.652
And... he wants to meet Zoe.

02:20.695 --> 02:22.782
She want to meet him? Why wouldn't she?

02:22.826 --> 02:25.304
Well, you refused
to meet her parents.

02:26.913 --> 02:29.956
Things have... changed.

02:30.000 --> 02:30.956
Have they?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.173
Yeah.

02:32.217 --> 02:33.695
She and I are in
a really good place.

02:33.739 --> 02:35.347
GIBBS: Yeah, we're
in the wrong place.

02:35.391 --> 02:37.347
Gear up.

02:37.391 --> 02:38.869
Got a dead marine.

02:46.347 --> 02:47.565
[clicks]

02:49.565 --> 02:51.565
Looks like the bike
was headed south,

02:51.608 --> 02:53.043
lost control,

02:53.086 --> 02:54.782
crossed the
center line,

02:54.826 --> 02:57.304
went over the shoulder
right here at a high speed.

02:57.347 --> 02:59.000
Can tell from where
it first landed.

03:00.521 --> 03:02.478
There's no skid mark,
no debris

03:02.521 --> 03:04.478
to indicate any other
vehicle was involved.

03:04.521 --> 03:07.000
Can you fall asleep
driving a motorcycle?

03:07.043 --> 03:09.347
Well, technically, one can
fall asleep doing anything.

03:09.391 --> 03:11.869
Anything, Jimmy?

03:17.565 --> 03:19.652
DiNozzo.
Yeah, boss?

03:19.695 --> 03:21.043
Talk to the
supervisor.

03:21.086 --> 03:22.478
Get what they bagged.

03:22.521 --> 03:24.304
Maybe they picked up
evidence we need to see.

03:24.347 --> 03:26.173
Sounds like a job
for a probie, boss.

03:26.217 --> 03:27.347
I asked you.

03:32.739 --> 03:34.304
Fingerprint confirms
his I.D.

03:34.347 --> 03:36.608
Marine Lance Corporal
David Austin.

03:36.652 --> 03:39.217
Stationed in Norfolk, was due
back this morning at 0800.

03:39.260 --> 03:41.130
Do you ever miss riding
your motorcycle, Doctor?

03:41.173 --> 03:42.478
My Norton?

03:42.521 --> 03:43.826
Ah, yes.

03:43.869 --> 03:45.739
I was a real chick-magnet.

03:45.782 --> 03:47.434
Yeah, you had that
bad-boy image.

03:47.478 --> 03:49.434
Moths to a flame.

03:49.478 --> 03:51.173
I always wanted
to get a scooter,

03:51.217 --> 03:53.130
but Breena would never let me
now that I'm a father.

03:53.173 --> 03:55.130
DUCKY: Hold on
to Breena, Mr. Palmer.

03:55.173 --> 03:57.000
Hold tightly.

03:57.043 --> 03:59.000
Duck, got a time of D?

03:59.043 --> 04:01.956
Um, I'd venture 4:00 a.m.,
plus or minus.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.173
Uh, preliminary cause of death
is a broken neck,

04:04.217 --> 04:08.043
but there is a contributing
and compelling factor.

04:08.086 --> 04:09.565
What's more compelling
than a broken neck?

04:09.608 --> 04:10.782
Mr. Palmer.

04:17.217 --> 04:19.173
A bullet wound to the chest.

04:22.304 --> 04:25.826
BISHOP:
Lance Corporal Austin was raised
in southern Pennsylvania.

04:25.869 --> 04:27.565
He spent the weekend
at his parents' farm

04:27.608 --> 04:29.304
and was on his way
back to Norfolk.

04:29.347 --> 04:30.652
A high-school
standout,

04:30.695 --> 04:33.260
he was offered several
baseball scholarships

04:33.304 --> 04:35.826
to Big East universities,
but his guidance counselor said

04:35.869 --> 04:37.434
his dream was
to be a marine.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.130
TONY: I've been trying
to reach his C.O.,

04:39.173 --> 04:40.739
but he's on
night-training maneuvers.

04:40.782 --> 04:41.739
I left word.

04:41.782 --> 04:42.739
Thanks, Chris.

04:44.478 --> 04:46.260
Hi, Mr. DiNozzo.

04:46.304 --> 04:48.695
Eleanor, if I was
30 years younger,

04:48.739 --> 04:50.695
and you weren't married,
oh, my God.

04:50.739 --> 04:52.000
Dad, what are you doing here?

04:53.434 --> 04:55.347
Uh, I took
an earlier train.

04:55.391 --> 04:57.478
Ah, my undercover son.

04:57.521 --> 04:59.000
How you doing,
Timothy?

04:59.043 --> 05:00.608
Always a
pleasure, "Dad."
[chuckles]

05:00.652 --> 05:02.043
How was the art
scene in Europe?

05:02.086 --> 05:04.000
We'll talk.

05:04.043 --> 05:05.782
Hey, Gibbs.
Good to see
you, chief.

05:05.826 --> 05:07.000
Good to see you.Dad.

05:07.043 --> 05:08.608
So just to repeat,

05:08.652 --> 05:11.434
um, what are you
doing here?

05:11.478 --> 05:12.652
I need a key.

05:12.695 --> 05:14.173
I went by the
apartment,

05:14.217 --> 05:16.043
but the building manager
wouldn't let me in.

05:16.086 --> 05:17.695
I'm so sorry,
that is my bad.

05:17.739 --> 05:19.173
I forgot to her
you were coming.

05:19.217 --> 05:21.043
No mischief.
Junior.

05:21.086 --> 05:23.043
Hey, low.
[chuckles]

05:23.086 --> 05:25.130
TONY: All right,
good to see you.

05:25.173 --> 05:27.130
Good to see you.
Uh, so we're
still on for dinner?

05:27.173 --> 05:28.434
With Zoe?
With Zoe.

05:28.478 --> 05:30.478
I'll make
reservations.
Oh, no.

05:30.521 --> 05:32.782
I'll take care of it.Oh, all right.

05:32.826 --> 05:34.260
Let me walk you
downstairs.

05:34.304 --> 05:36.043
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

05:36.086 --> 05:38.043
Yeah, Abbs, on my way down.

05:51.782 --> 05:53.130
What are you doing?

05:53.173 --> 05:55.173
Hey, Gibbs.
Spring cleaning.

05:55.217 --> 05:57.782
It's a time
of renewal.

05:57.826 --> 05:59.260
Of rebirth.

05:59.304 --> 06:01.260
Out with the old,
make room for the new.

06:01.304 --> 06:03.521
It-it's very invigorating.

06:04.913 --> 06:08.130
Your basement.

06:08.173 --> 06:10.130
When's the last time
you went through all that?

06:10.173 --> 06:12.130
I'm sure there's tons
of old stuff in there

06:12.173 --> 06:14.000
that you haven't touched
in years.

06:14.043 --> 06:15.478
I will come over,
and I will help you.

06:15.521 --> 06:17.391
Hey, you stay away
from my basement.

06:19.434 --> 06:20.652
Why am I here?

06:20.695 --> 06:23.391
Ducky pulled an intact slug

06:23.434 --> 06:25.391
out of the lance
corporal's chest.

06:25.434 --> 06:28.304
I ran it through NIBIN,
and it got a match.

06:28.347 --> 06:32.521
It was fired from
an FN Five-seven pistol.

06:32.565 --> 06:35.782
Just like this one.Registered to?

06:35.826 --> 06:38.130
It was purchased directly
from the manufacturer

06:38.173 --> 06:40.000
by the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco,

06:40.043 --> 06:41.826
Firearms and
Explosives.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.043
ATF?

06:43.086 --> 06:44.304
It's crazy.

06:44.347 --> 06:47.347
Did an ATF agent
just kill our marine?

06:56.173 --> 06:59.130
Checked our records,
and you are correct.

06:59.173 --> 07:01.782
The gun was purchased in
2009 by our ATF offices

07:01.826 --> 07:04.130
in Tucson as part of
a sting operation.

07:04.173 --> 07:05.652
Operation Fast and Furious.

07:06.826 --> 07:09.391
Yeah.

07:09.434 --> 07:11.217
It was a disaster.

07:11.260 --> 07:13.086
KEATES: It was
well-intentioned.

07:13.130 --> 07:15.086
Look, the idea
was to purposely

07:15.130 --> 07:18.000
let licensed firearms dealers
sell weapons to straw buyers.

07:18.043 --> 07:20.478
Person makes a purchase
on behalf of another person

07:20.521 --> 07:22.086
who legally isn't
allowed to buy.

07:22.130 --> 07:24.521
Exactly, and then ATF was
hoping to track the guns

07:24.565 --> 07:27.130
to Mexican drug
cartel leaders.

07:27.173 --> 07:28.782
Didn't go as planned.

07:28.826 --> 07:30.391
Ya think?

07:30.434 --> 07:33.304
Weapons started showing up at
violent crime all over Mexico.

07:33.347 --> 07:36.000
How many weapons
are we talking about?

07:39.086 --> 07:41.043
Altogether, 2,000
firearms were purchased

07:41.086 --> 07:43.434
by straw buyers
during that operation.

07:43.478 --> 07:45.608
And as of today,

07:45.652 --> 07:47.652
we've only recovered
about 700 of them.

07:47.695 --> 07:50.304
So 1,300 weapons walked?

07:50.347 --> 07:52.130
Yeah.

07:52.173 --> 07:54.000
Including the murder weapon
that we're looking for.

07:55.260 --> 07:57.217
Any idea how it went
missing in Mexico

07:57.260 --> 07:58.826
and ended up
in Washington, DC?

08:00.739 --> 08:02.521
No.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.521
But my director assigned
me to help you find out.

08:04.565 --> 08:06.347
Thank you,
Agent Keates.

08:10.347 --> 08:13.217
Gibbs, you got a moment?

08:16.956 --> 08:19.434
Fast and Furious was
an embarrassment to ATF.

08:19.478 --> 08:20.869
The effects of the scandal
were felt

08:20.913 --> 08:22.434
all the way up
to the attorney general.

08:23.304 --> 08:24.434
Tread lightly.

08:24.478 --> 08:26.304
Got a dead marine, Leon.

08:29.347 --> 08:30.739
What time?

08:30.782 --> 08:32.565
Well, my father's
a very Continental man,

08:32.608 --> 08:35.565
so I'm saying dinner's
probably 8:30, 9:00.

08:35.608 --> 08:38.391
Okay, should I go
home, change first?

08:38.434 --> 08:40.043
I see no reason
to do that.

08:40.086 --> 08:41.869
I think you look
exquisite.

08:41.913 --> 08:45.869
Thank you, I just want
everything to go perfectly.

08:45.913 --> 08:47.869
But to tell you the truth,
I'm a nervous wreck.

08:47.913 --> 08:50.652
I think I've seen Meet the
Parentsway too many times.

08:50.695 --> 08:52.043
[chuckles]

08:52.086 --> 08:53.913
Well, I can assure you
my father is, uh,

08:53.956 --> 08:55.652
nothing like
Robert De Nero.

08:55.695 --> 08:57.434
GIBBS:
Come on, come on, get to work.

08:57.478 --> 08:59.304
Gibbs,
on the other hand...

08:59.347 --> 09:01.478
Talk to Austin's C.O.?

09:01.521 --> 09:03.217
Yeah, said he
was well-liked,

09:03.260 --> 09:06.652
no enemies, spotless record.BISHOP: He's an infantryman.

09:06.695 --> 09:08.869
He had no access to sensitive
or classified information.

09:08.913 --> 09:11.478
Agent Keates has been tasked to
help us track the murder weapon

09:11.521 --> 09:12.869
from Mexico to DC.

09:15.043 --> 09:16.521
I'd like to volunteer
to work with Agent Keates.

09:16.565 --> 09:18.000
I think we have
a shorthand

09:18.043 --> 09:19.913
that might expedite
the investigation.

09:19.956 --> 09:23.434
You sure?Yeah, that'll work.

09:23.478 --> 09:26.304
Uh, Bishop and I can retrace
Austin's steps from the time

09:26.347 --> 09:28.304
he left his parents' farm
to the highway shooting.

09:28.347 --> 09:30.434
Go.

09:32.391 --> 09:33.782
McGEE:
Hey, Abbs.

09:33.826 --> 09:35.608
Team McBishop,
always a pleasure.

09:35.652 --> 09:37.043
BISHOP:
We could use some help.

09:37.086 --> 09:38.391
Motorcycle tell you anything?

09:38.434 --> 09:40.391
Yes, but we'll get
to that in a minute.

09:40.434 --> 09:43.086
I want to talk
about Austin's jacket first.

09:43.130 --> 09:44.521
Now, I did a GSR test.

09:44.565 --> 09:46.304
And powder and
stippling suggest

09:46.347 --> 09:48.043
that the weapon was
two to three feet away

09:48.086 --> 09:49.260
from him when he got shot.

09:49.304 --> 09:51.260
Whoa. Based on
the trajectory

09:51.304 --> 09:53.086
of the bike going
off the road,

09:53.130 --> 09:56.521
we estimate Austin was traveling
between 50 and 60 miles an hour.

09:56.565 --> 09:58.956
So the shooter had to be
moving parallel to him,

09:59.000 --> 10:00.739
in or on another vehicle.

10:00.782 --> 10:02.173
Exactly.
Now, walk this way.

10:03.173 --> 10:05.130
I found something curious.

10:05.173 --> 10:08.521
The bike's low-fuel
indicator is on.

10:09.826 --> 10:11.217
Take a peak.

10:13.956 --> 10:15.695
McGEE: It was
running on fumes.

10:15.739 --> 10:17.695
Never would have
made it to Norfolk.

10:17.739 --> 10:18.739
Now walk this way.

10:21.304 --> 10:24.260
We know
that Austin...

10:24.304 --> 10:26.913
was traveling south
on this road,

10:26.956 --> 10:28.521
headed to Norfolk.

10:28.565 --> 10:31.956
He passed a 24-hour
gas station

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
right here, two miles
before he got shot.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.956
Austin had to know that
he was running out of gas.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.217
So why didn't
he stop?

10:42.260 --> 10:44.260
Think we need
to find out.

10:45.695 --> 10:47.652
Look, I agree.

10:47.695 --> 10:50.260
ATF agents who worked the sting
could help us track the weapon,

10:50.304 --> 10:52.695
but ordering them to
NCIS for questioning?

10:52.739 --> 10:53.695
It's a big mistake.

10:53.739 --> 10:55.695
Totally disagree.

10:55.739 --> 10:58.086
Fast and Furious damaged
a lot of agents' careers.

10:58.130 --> 11:00.086
No one really wants
to relive it.

11:00.130 --> 11:02.304
It's not about
what they want, Zoe.

11:02.347 --> 11:05.304
Okay, but we come on too strong,
they'll shut down.

11:05.347 --> 11:07.130
We should go to them--
it's less adversarial.

11:07.173 --> 11:09.000
Listen, I've been doing this
a little longer than you,

11:09.043 --> 11:10.391
and I know one thing:

11:10.434 --> 11:11.826
we got to put
pressure on them.

11:11.869 --> 11:12.869
Trust me.

11:14.913 --> 11:17.869
[sighs] You know, I hate it
when someone says "trust me."

11:17.913 --> 11:19.260
I immediately don't.

11:19.304 --> 11:21.739
[chuckles] Are we having
our first argument?

11:40.434 --> 11:41.826
Hi.

11:41.869 --> 11:43.304
Howdy.

11:43.347 --> 11:46.086
NCIS, Special Agents
McGee and Bishop.

11:46.130 --> 11:48.086
Uh, what can I
do for you?

11:48.130 --> 11:50.434
McGEE: Well, we're
investigating an accident

11:50.478 --> 11:52.130
that happened
about two miles south of here.

11:52.173 --> 11:54.304
Guy who was killed
on the motorcycle?

11:54.347 --> 11:56.434
Yeah.Everyone's been
talking about it.

11:56.478 --> 11:58.434
Road was closed down
all morning.

11:58.478 --> 12:02.000
Uh, why is NCIS involved?He was a marine.

12:02.043 --> 12:03.565
BISHOP: We noticed you have
security cameras.

12:03.608 --> 12:06.304
We're hoping they might show
vehicles passing on the road.

12:06.347 --> 12:09.043
Ah, sorry, j-just the pumps
and inside the store.

12:09.086 --> 12:11.478
Were you on duty
around 4:00 this morning?

12:11.521 --> 12:13.521
Maybe saw something suspicious?

12:13.565 --> 12:16.652
No, uh, my idiot step-son was.

12:16.695 --> 12:18.913
He was probably sound asleep
at that time.

12:18.956 --> 12:20.434
He...

12:21.695 --> 12:23.347
Look at that fool.

12:25.086 --> 12:27.043
You stupid imbecile!

12:27.086 --> 12:31.000
The last number is a nine,
not a six.

12:31.043 --> 12:32.260
Flip it around.

12:35.739 --> 12:37.391
I swear the boy's
as dumb as his mother.

12:39.086 --> 12:41.652
What time did you say, ma'am?About 4:00 a.m.

12:41.695 --> 12:43.652
I was going through credit card
transactions this morning,

12:43.695 --> 12:45.608
saw something real strange.

12:45.652 --> 12:48.043
3:50 a.m., somebody
swiped a credit card,

12:48.086 --> 12:49.478
never pumped any gas.

12:49.521 --> 12:51.608
How do you know that?

12:51.652 --> 12:53.608
Well, once, um, there's
no activity for a minute,

12:53.652 --> 12:56.043
uh, system records it as
a canceled transaction.

12:56.086 --> 12:57.434
What's the name
on the credit card?

12:57.478 --> 12:59.086
Um...

12:59.130 --> 13:00.913
David Austin.

13:02.565 --> 13:04.521
Well, we're gonna need to
see your security footage

13:04.565 --> 13:06.434
from about 3:50 a.m.
this morning.

13:10.304 --> 13:12.391
All right, just run it
in normal speed from here.

13:14.913 --> 13:16.260
That's Austin.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.956
McGEE: Is he staring
at that car?

13:25.000 --> 13:26.956
I don't know.

13:32.565 --> 13:34.347
BISHOP:
Is he following him?

13:36.130 --> 13:37.956
TONY: No, I hear
what you're saying.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.956
It's just, your ATF buddies were
a little less than forthcoming.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.347
It's because you had
to do it your way.

13:42.391 --> 13:44.782
Look, you were too aggressive,
you intimidated them.

13:44.826 --> 13:45.782
Yes, dear.

13:45.826 --> 13:47.739
What do you
suggest we do?

13:47.782 --> 13:50.739
Look, I worked with an agent who
was in Arizona during the sting,

13:50.782 --> 13:53.478
we have a relationship--
let me reach out to him.

13:53.521 --> 13:55.608
You have
a relationship?

13:55.652 --> 13:58.086
He was like a
mentor to me.

13:58.130 --> 13:59.826
Mm, you like mentors.

13:59.869 --> 14:02.130
Stop.
[chuckles]

14:02.173 --> 14:04.565
[fire alarm blaring]What is...?

14:06.000 --> 14:06.956
Dad?!

14:07.000 --> 14:08.217
SENIOR:
Hey, Junior.

14:08.260 --> 14:10.391
Have you got
a fire extinguisher?

14:10.434 --> 14:11.869
TONY: Oh, God,
what did you do?

14:16.652 --> 14:18.434
You must be Zoe.

14:18.478 --> 14:20.434
Should I call 9-1-1?

14:20.478 --> 14:21.739
No, I got it.

14:21.782 --> 14:23.478
Good work, Junior.

14:23.521 --> 14:26.043
Wow, Tony was right.

14:26.086 --> 14:29.043
You have the most
piercing eyes.

14:29.086 --> 14:30.304
Beautiful.

14:30.347 --> 14:31.739
Thank you.

14:31.782 --> 14:33.130
[alarm stops]

14:33.173 --> 14:35.130
Ah, relief.

14:35.173 --> 14:38.043
TONY: Well, you've destroyed
my kitchen.

14:38.086 --> 14:39.391
Again.

14:39.434 --> 14:40.608
What were you doing?

14:40.652 --> 14:43.434
I was preparing
an intimate dinner

14:43.478 --> 14:45.869
for the three of us
so I could get to know

14:45.913 --> 14:48.086
this beautiful lady
of yours.

14:48.130 --> 14:50.913
I'm gonna open up the windows,
get some fresh air in here.

14:52.434 --> 14:54.826
Oh![thump]

14:58.043 --> 14:59.826
You've rearranged
the furniture.

14:59.869 --> 15:01.826
You weren't taking
advantage of the view.

15:01.869 --> 15:04.434
I thought you were making
dinner reservations.

15:04.478 --> 15:05.478
I didn't say that.

15:05.521 --> 15:09.043
I said I would
take care of dinner.

15:09.086 --> 15:12.434
I was preparing Junior's
favorite-- beef Wellington.

15:12.478 --> 15:15.652
It's a tiny filet
coated with pâté

15:15.695 --> 15:16.913
and duxelles,

15:16.956 --> 15:18.304
baked to perfection.

15:18.347 --> 15:20.913
Such an ambitious
undertaking by the father,

15:20.956 --> 15:23.739
you'd think that the son would,
uh, show some appreciation.

15:23.782 --> 15:26.304
Appreciate? Look what
you did to my kitchen.

15:26.347 --> 15:28.304
You know, I-I...
I think I should just leave.

15:28.347 --> 15:29.478
No, no...No, no, no, no.

15:29.521 --> 15:30.956
Don't leave me with
Wreck-It-Ralph.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.782
We can just reschedule.

15:32.826 --> 15:34.826
No, please, Zoe.

15:34.869 --> 15:37.608
I told you I wasn't
exaggerating.

15:37.652 --> 15:39.043
This always happens.

15:39.086 --> 15:40.652
Thank God he lives
in New York.

15:50.478 --> 15:52.434
Where is Gibbs?McGEE:
It's early. He's not in yet.

15:52.478 --> 15:54.913
What time'd you get here?Ugh. Hours ago.

15:54.956 --> 15:58.826
So I enlarged and enhanced your
gas station security video.

15:58.869 --> 16:00.956
I didn't get a clear shot
of the driver's face,

16:01.000 --> 16:03.043
but based on

16:03.086 --> 16:05.043
the known height
of the vehicle, I determined

16:05.086 --> 16:07.782
that he's between
five, ten and six feet tall,

16:07.826 --> 16:09.739
175 pounds.

16:09.782 --> 16:13.739
And... I know what the
marine saw in the car.

16:13.782 --> 16:16.434
I removed
this reflection.

16:16.478 --> 16:20.043
There's a girl in the car.

16:20.086 --> 16:21.217
What'd she say?

16:22.086 --> 16:24.000
[mouthing]

16:24.043 --> 16:26.000
BISHOP AND ABBY:
Help me.

16:31.043 --> 16:33.521
It appears Lance Corporal
Austin was a Good Samaritan,

16:33.565 --> 16:35.043
trying to help
the young woman.

16:35.086 --> 16:37.130
He took chase
and apparently got shot

16:37.173 --> 16:39.130
with the ATF gun
for his good deed.

16:39.173 --> 16:41.043
Anything on the driver?

16:41.086 --> 16:42.826
Used a stolen credit card
to buy the gas.

16:42.869 --> 16:45.000
Abby wasn't able to I.D. him
him from the video,

16:45.043 --> 16:47.782
but she was able
to get a clear image

16:47.826 --> 16:50.739
of the license plate.McGEE: The car doesn't
belong to the driver.

16:50.782 --> 16:52.956
It's registered
to a Jennifer Vickers.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.521
I'm pulling up her
driver's license now.

16:54.565 --> 16:57.782
Jennifer Vickers looks older
than the woman in the car.

16:57.826 --> 16:59.043
License says she's 39.

16:59.086 --> 17:00.739
Yeah. I'll check her out.

17:01.739 --> 17:03.086
Sorry I was late.

17:03.130 --> 17:04.608
I mean, I'm not sorry,
I don't apologize, 'cause

17:04.652 --> 17:06.217
it's a sign of weakness,
but had the night from hell.

17:06.260 --> 17:09.478
What happened?Typical DiNozzo
family get-together.

17:09.521 --> 17:11.956
You know? Dad almost burns
the apartment down

17:12.000 --> 17:13.782
and then we have
a huge shouting match.

17:13.826 --> 17:15.434
He left in a huff.

17:15.478 --> 17:18.043
I think Zoe was really impressed
with our dysfunctional dynamic.

17:18.086 --> 17:20.869
Where'd your dad go?I'm guessing
his old stomping grounds,

17:20.913 --> 17:23.217
the Adams House.You're guessing wrong.

17:23.260 --> 17:24.565
He showed up at my place.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.391
He... He spent the night
at-at your place?

17:33.434 --> 17:35.173
Yes. In my bed.

17:35.217 --> 17:37.000
Huh. W...[phone rings]

17:37.043 --> 17:38.869
Your phone, DiNozzo.

17:41.217 --> 17:42.913
It's MTAC.

17:42.956 --> 17:44.913
DiNozzo.

17:44.956 --> 17:46.521
He spent the night with...

17:46.565 --> 17:48.478
Wow. Yes.
No, I'm here.

17:48.521 --> 17:49.956
Copy that.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.173
Zoe's made contact with
an ATF agent who was in Tucson

17:52.217 --> 17:54.086
during the sting.
He's in San Francisco now.

17:54.130 --> 17:56.304
He's about to call in.

17:56.347 --> 17:58.434
Get going.I don't know what
I was thinking.

17:58.478 --> 18:00.391
I never should've suggested
working with Keates.

18:00.434 --> 18:01.869
That was not a good idea.

18:01.913 --> 18:03.826
I would like to invoke
rule number 12: never date

18:03.869 --> 18:05.304
a coworker.[mouths]

18:05.347 --> 18:06.913
You and she having a problem?

18:06.956 --> 18:09.000
I don't want it to become one.
Work came first.

18:09.043 --> 18:10.391
We were dating second.

18:12.652 --> 18:14.130
Please?

18:14.173 --> 18:16.130
And then we watched while
purchasers bought weapons

18:16.173 --> 18:18.304
and took 'em
to stash houses and cars

18:18.347 --> 18:19.913
waiting in parking lots and...

18:19.956 --> 18:21.565
and we called in our supervisors

18:21.608 --> 18:24.521
and they told us to stand down.

18:24.565 --> 18:27.043
And I went on record
and I asked the ATF.

18:27.086 --> 18:30.043
I said are you prepared
to attend the funeral

18:30.086 --> 18:32.347
of a slain agent
or a border patrol officer

18:32.391 --> 18:34.173
if he or she is killed

18:34.217 --> 18:36.304
by one of these
straw-purchased weapons?

18:36.347 --> 18:39.130
And I'm sure you didn't get any
satisfaction from being right.

18:39.173 --> 18:40.869
Hell, no.[whispers]: Where's Tony?

18:40.913 --> 18:43.521
Um, he's in the middle
of something.

18:43.565 --> 18:45.869
Uh, since you were
in Tucson at the time,

18:45.913 --> 18:47.565
I thought maybe
you could shed some light

18:47.608 --> 18:48.913
on this specific weapon.

18:48.956 --> 18:51.913
Zoe, that was eight years ago.

18:51.956 --> 18:54.869
Just give me a serial number,
I'll see what I can do.

18:54.913 --> 18:57.173
I guess we're done.

18:58.913 --> 19:01.434
McGee. Keep me in the loop.

19:01.478 --> 19:02.565
Yes, sir.

19:05.521 --> 19:06.739
What's going on with Tony?

19:06.782 --> 19:07.869
Uh, what do you mean?

19:07.913 --> 19:09.130
I asked him up here.

19:09.173 --> 19:11.217
Oh. Uh, well, he's...

19:11.260 --> 19:13.217
he's with Gibbs.

19:13.260 --> 19:15.217
I mean, he-he's
doing something.

19:15.260 --> 19:17.521
It's actually for Gibbs,
but he's with Gibbs.

19:18.869 --> 19:20.043
I'm gonna go.

19:25.391 --> 19:27.130
Can I get you something?

19:27.173 --> 19:30.608
NCIS Special Agents Gibbs
and Bishop.

19:30.652 --> 19:32.565
You Jennifer
Vickers?Yes.

19:33.782 --> 19:35.217
And you're not here to eat.

19:35.260 --> 19:36.521
No, ma'am.

19:37.652 --> 19:39.478
Is this your car?

19:39.521 --> 19:41.043
Well, it looks like it.

19:41.086 --> 19:43.043
Technically,
that is my car,

19:43.086 --> 19:45.043
but my daughter Emma's
been driving it.

19:45.086 --> 19:46.695
You know where she is?

19:46.739 --> 19:49.260
She in some kind of trouble?

19:50.304 --> 19:52.043
When is the last time
you saw Emma?

19:52.086 --> 19:54.347
Couple of weeks ago.

19:55.782 --> 19:56.869
Has she been arrested?

19:56.913 --> 19:58.826
No.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.347
Is she dead?

20:04.086 --> 20:06.173
We don't know.
Why would you ask that?

20:08.086 --> 20:09.652
Because she's been...

20:09.695 --> 20:12.652
in and out of rehab
and she has been

20:12.695 --> 20:14.043
hanging with a very bad crowd.

20:14.086 --> 20:17.434
We had an argument.
She moved out of our apartment.

20:17.478 --> 20:20.043
I know she's using again.

20:20.086 --> 20:22.304
Think her father
might know where she is?

20:22.347 --> 20:25.000
I raised Emma. She's never had
any contact with her father.

20:25.956 --> 20:27.347
She have a cell phone?

20:27.391 --> 20:29.913
Not anymore.

20:29.956 --> 20:32.130
We had a family plan
and I turned her phone off.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.260
She was using her phone
to call her dealer.

20:38.565 --> 20:41.130
Can I ask why
you're looking for her?

20:44.782 --> 20:46.043
Is this Emma?

20:49.869 --> 20:52.347
Oh, my God. Emma.

20:52.391 --> 20:54.739
GIBBS:
That was taken two nights
ago. She was with a man.

20:54.782 --> 20:57.000
You have any idea
who that might be?

21:03.347 --> 21:05.217
Well, National Crime
Information Center's

21:05.260 --> 21:06.913
putting out a BOLO
on Emma Vickers.

21:06.956 --> 21:08.086
Still no hits on the car yet.

21:08.130 --> 21:09.217
Well, I spoke to her last

21:09.260 --> 21:10.956
Narcotics Anonymous sponsor.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.695
She hasn't been
to a meeting in months.

21:12.739 --> 21:14.826
I tell you, we
find the driver,

21:14.869 --> 21:16.434
we find her.

21:16.478 --> 21:18.956
Who the hell is he?
Oh.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.521
What's up, Zoe?

21:21.565 --> 21:24.000
I just heard back from
Special Agent Caffey.

21:25.521 --> 21:27.347
So which one of you guys
am I working with?

21:27.391 --> 21:29.391
Me.

21:30.478 --> 21:32.043
Do you and I have a problem?

21:32.086 --> 21:33.695
No?

21:33.739 --> 21:35.478
No.

21:35.521 --> 21:36.565
No.

21:36.608 --> 21:38.260
Then why didn't you
come up to MTAC?

21:38.304 --> 21:39.913
'Cause I had...

21:39.956 --> 21:41.391
I was dealing with my father.

21:41.434 --> 21:42.913
Really?

21:42.956 --> 21:46.086
'Cause McGee said you were
doing something for Gibbs.

21:46.130 --> 21:48.304
You really got to get your
lies straight, DiNozzo.

21:48.347 --> 21:52.478
DiNozzo? You've never
gone surname on me before.

21:52.521 --> 21:54.130
You've never gone liar on me.

21:54.173 --> 21:55.304
McGEE:
Uh,

21:55.347 --> 21:56.739
what did Agent Caffey say?

21:58.260 --> 22:00.173
He said that
he was sorry,

22:00.217 --> 22:02.434
and he tried, but couldn't
find anything on our weapon.

22:02.478 --> 22:04.826
He's stonewalling us
just like the others then.

22:04.869 --> 22:07.826
Tony, he's a good agent
and a good friend,

22:07.869 --> 22:11.826
and if Phil says he couldn't
find anything, he couldn't.

22:11.869 --> 22:13.347
And considering
that you didn't even bother

22:13.391 --> 22:15.217
to show up to speak with him,

22:15.260 --> 22:18.434
I don't think you're in any
position to question him.

22:18.478 --> 22:21.304
You know, I'm gonna have
to go with Tony on this one.

22:21.347 --> 22:23.217
He did seem
a little reluctant to help.

22:23.260 --> 22:27.739
Yeah, but that's because
Fast and Furious was a mistake.

22:27.782 --> 22:30.695
Look, trust me, ATF would not
impede the investigation

22:30.739 --> 22:32.347
of a marine's death.

22:32.391 --> 22:34.217
Did you just say, "Trust me"?

22:42.304 --> 22:43.913
Hey, Gibbs.

22:43.956 --> 22:46.086
Want a drink?

22:46.130 --> 22:48.608
Kind of looks
like my Scotch.

22:48.652 --> 22:50.782
It is.No. Thanks.

22:50.826 --> 22:52.043
Did you eat dinner?

22:52.086 --> 22:54.260
No. I wasn't hungry.

22:54.304 --> 22:56.260
You have anything
to eat today?

22:56.304 --> 22:59.043
Uh-uh.

23:01.521 --> 23:03.130
You want to talk

23:03.173 --> 23:05.782
about what's going on
between you and Tony?

23:05.826 --> 23:10.043
When we worked
on that art scheme last month,

23:10.086 --> 23:11.739
I got invigorated.

23:11.782 --> 23:13.782
I loved that world.

23:13.826 --> 23:15.869
I went to Europe.

23:15.913 --> 23:20.000
Thought I could, uh, renew
some old acquaintances,

23:20.043 --> 23:21.869
get back in the game.

23:21.913 --> 23:25.565
But all my contacts
were gone or dried up.

23:25.608 --> 23:27.913
The trip was a bust.

23:27.956 --> 23:30.304
Maybe it's time
to reduce the workload.

23:30.347 --> 23:32.434
You've been at it
a long time, chief.

23:32.478 --> 23:34.608
I thought about that.

23:34.652 --> 23:36.478
I went to New York.

23:36.521 --> 23:38.043
All my old
friends had moved

23:38.086 --> 23:40.217
to be nearer their
grandchildren, or in

23:40.260 --> 23:42.608
retirement homes, or...

23:42.652 --> 23:44.739
just plain gone.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.217
Entering a new phase of life.

23:50.260 --> 23:53.000
You'll figure it out.

23:53.043 --> 23:54.913
Oh, I have.

23:54.956 --> 23:58.260
I realize that there's only
one thing that matters to me.

23:58.304 --> 24:00.260
Junior.

24:00.304 --> 24:03.521
Who knows how
much time I have.

24:03.565 --> 24:06.043
I want to be near him. Hmm?

24:06.086 --> 24:08.521
I hear you.

24:08.565 --> 24:11.782
I wish my dad lived closer
than he did.

24:11.826 --> 24:16.043
Last few years, I tried
to get him to move in with me.

24:16.086 --> 24:18.260
God, he was stubborn.

24:18.304 --> 24:20.521
Stubborn as hell.

24:20.565 --> 24:22.434
Set in his ways.

24:22.478 --> 24:25.043
I regret that...

24:28.217 --> 24:30.608
...I didn't try
to push him harder than I did.

24:33.130 --> 24:37.782
Before I could tell Tony
how I... feel,

24:37.826 --> 24:40.217
I messed up.

24:41.652 --> 24:43.565
I always do.

24:43.608 --> 24:45.913
Things got
out of hand.

24:45.956 --> 24:47.521
Um...

24:47.565 --> 24:50.565
Junior made it clear.

24:50.608 --> 24:53.000
He doesn't want me around.

24:55.086 --> 24:56.434
[phone ringing]

24:56.478 --> 24:59.826
Hang on, chief.
I got to get this.

24:59.869 --> 25:01.608
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

25:01.652 --> 25:04.086
Where?

25:07.782 --> 25:11.782
Metro patrol unit, responding
to our BOLO, found the car.

25:11.826 --> 25:14.260
Tony and McGee went
to get the MCRT truck.

25:14.304 --> 25:16.695
Ducky and Jimmy
are on their way.

25:20.130 --> 25:22.695
GIBBS:
Emma Vickers?

25:22.739 --> 25:25.130
Yeah.

25:32.695 --> 25:35.478
BISHOP:
Jake worries-- just letting him
know I'll be home soon.

25:35.521 --> 25:37.391
Ah. Home.
Mm-hmm.

25:37.434 --> 25:38.782
I thought I'd be there

25:38.826 --> 25:40.913
with John Wayne
and a bottle of Pinot.

25:40.956 --> 25:43.478
The Searchers, maybe The Duke's best.

25:43.521 --> 25:45.608
Hmm. Zoe into an
evening like that?

25:45.652 --> 25:48.086
Oh, no. I mean,
I offered. She passed.

25:48.130 --> 25:49.478
What'd Ducky say?

25:49.521 --> 25:51.304
Time of death was
about 7:00 p.m.

25:51.347 --> 25:52.913
The gas station video
was from two days ago.

25:52.956 --> 25:54.304
Where's she been?

25:54.347 --> 25:57.478
TONY: All right.
I'm done. Let's go.

25:57.521 --> 25:59.956
DiNozzo,
you're with me.

26:01.478 --> 26:03.217
See you.

26:06.130 --> 26:07.826
Oh, that's all right.

26:07.869 --> 26:09.869
If you wait till I put something
on, I'll be right down.

26:09.913 --> 26:13.086
Nettie, show Mr. Neff
into the living room.

26:15.739 --> 26:17.434
[door opening]

26:21.217 --> 26:23.086
Junior.

26:25.130 --> 26:28.391
I am going downstairs to
the basement to unwind.

26:28.434 --> 26:31.173
Be gone when I come
back upstairs.

26:31.217 --> 26:32.869
Ah.

26:32.913 --> 26:35.869
Both of you.

26:35.913 --> 26:37.695
Well, I guess
it's check-out time.

26:37.739 --> 26:40.086
Let's get your things.

26:40.130 --> 26:42.782
Where am I gonna go?
I'm in my pajamas.
Dad,

26:42.826 --> 26:44.956
Gibbs told me why
you came to Washington,

26:45.000 --> 26:47.130
that you want to move here,
and I understand.

26:47.173 --> 26:48.956
[sighs]

26:49.000 --> 26:50.782
I want to help you
find an apartment.

26:50.826 --> 26:53.391
I should have called
you ahead of time,

26:53.434 --> 26:56.086
told you what I was thinking.

26:56.130 --> 26:58.130
DiNozzos.

26:58.173 --> 27:00.434
We're impulsive.
We act before we think.

27:01.869 --> 27:03.521
I'm sorry about last night.

27:03.565 --> 27:05.521
I said things I didn't mean.

27:05.565 --> 27:07.608
I'm not so sure.

27:09.739 --> 27:11.478
Maybe you
were right.
Hmm.

27:11.521 --> 27:15.608
Why did I assume that
you'd take care of me?

27:15.652 --> 27:19.565
I usually wasn't around
when you needed help.

27:19.608 --> 27:21.391
Mm-hmm.

27:21.434 --> 27:22.739
Ancient history.

27:22.782 --> 27:25.173
Hmm?

27:38.478 --> 27:41.043
DUCKY:
Well, let us begin.

27:41.086 --> 27:43.217
DUCKY:
Are you all right?

27:43.260 --> 27:45.304
No.

27:45.347 --> 27:48.173
Well, she-she certainly isn't
our first drug overdose, but...

27:48.217 --> 27:50.782
seeing this young girl...

27:50.826 --> 27:55.652
Fatherhood has changed
your perspective, Mr. Palmer?

27:55.695 --> 27:58.826
Yes. Look at these track marks.

27:58.869 --> 28:00.782
This ulcerated skin.

28:00.826 --> 28:02.565
I mean, she was a chronic user.

28:02.608 --> 28:05.347
I just wish
I could raise Victoria

28:05.391 --> 28:08.086
in a different time,
you know, one without drugs.

28:08.130 --> 28:09.913
That's a sweet thought,

28:09.956 --> 28:11.695
but not possible,
I'm afraid.

28:11.739 --> 28:13.521
GIBBS:
What have you
got for me, Duck?

28:13.565 --> 28:15.434
All indications are
a drug overdose.

28:15.478 --> 28:17.260
I'll know definitively

28:17.304 --> 28:19.608
when we get the results
of the tox screen.

28:19.652 --> 28:22.478
We also found extensive
bruising, at least a week old.

28:22.521 --> 28:25.956
Also, some teeth bite marks.
Both indicate prior abuse.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.434
Do a full sexual assault kit?

28:27.478 --> 28:29.086
Already sent it up to Abby.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.652
BISHOP:
Ready?
Relax.

28:35.695 --> 28:39.130
If you're in such a hurry,
why don't you go get the car?Okay.

28:39.173 --> 28:40.565
You guys tell Gibbs
where you're going?

28:40.608 --> 28:42.695
Well, I'm a senior agent,
you're McNot.

28:42.739 --> 28:44.347
I can take
the initiative.

28:44.391 --> 28:45.826
Initiative's good.

28:45.869 --> 28:47.478
Still like to know
where you're going.

28:47.521 --> 28:49.913
That's amazing,
'cause I was just calling you.

28:49.956 --> 28:52.608
Uh, Bishop and I are going back
to the alley where

28:52.652 --> 28:54.086
Emma Vickers' body
was found.
BISHOP:
Yeah, thought we might

28:54.130 --> 28:56.347
find something in daylight
that we missed last night.

28:56.391 --> 28:57.739
Possible witness, video.

28:57.782 --> 28:58.956
Boss, Abby talk to you yet?

28:59.000 --> 29:00.347
No, not yet. She find something?

29:00.391 --> 29:02.130
No. The car
was a bust.

29:02.173 --> 29:03.478
It's old. No nav system.

29:03.521 --> 29:04.739
She couldn't track
its whereabouts.

29:04.782 --> 29:06.260
She lift any prints?

29:06.304 --> 29:07.956
BISHOP:
Nope. She found traces
of hand sanitizer.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.565
It looked like someone tried
to wipe the car clean.

29:09.608 --> 29:11.826
Go, Bishop.
Going.

29:16.739 --> 29:19.347
Hey, thanks for making me
and Senior talk last night.

29:19.391 --> 29:21.043
We really needed that.

29:21.086 --> 29:23.260
So,

29:23.304 --> 29:24.913
he's moving down here.

29:24.956 --> 29:28.086
I guess that way,
I can keep an eye on him.

29:28.130 --> 29:29.565
Good idea.

29:29.608 --> 29:31.217
Yup.

29:31.260 --> 29:34.260
Thanks for letting him crash
at your pad.

29:42.260 --> 29:45.565
[sighs]

29:45.608 --> 29:47.260
[footsteps approaching]

29:47.304 --> 29:50.652
Oh. Zoe!

29:50.695 --> 29:53.260
Oh, sorry. I didn't know
anyone was here.

29:53.304 --> 29:55.478
Ah.
I lost my sunglasses, and

29:55.521 --> 29:57.217
this is the last place
I remember seeing them.

29:57.260 --> 30:00.391
Let's take a look around.

30:00.434 --> 30:02.913
You have a key. I don't.

30:04.826 --> 30:07.217
I'm just gonna
check in the bedroom.

30:07.260 --> 30:09.695
Well, I'll, uh,
look around out here.

30:11.434 --> 30:16.000
You seem bothered by the
fact that I have a key.

30:16.043 --> 30:18.434
Oh, no, no. I, uh...
I think it's great.

30:18.478 --> 30:20.956
I'm glad that Junior
has made a commitment

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
to such a lovely lady
like yourself.

30:27.521 --> 30:29.086
Ah.

30:29.130 --> 30:31.217
Ah. Found 'em.

30:31.260 --> 30:32.608
Oh. Great.

30:32.652 --> 30:34.434
Well, I... I got
to get going.

30:34.478 --> 30:39.086
Zoe, uh, that comment
I made about commitment--

30:39.130 --> 30:41.173
did that scare you?

30:41.217 --> 30:43.000
Maybe a little.

30:43.043 --> 30:46.043
You know, I haven't set
a very good example for Junior.

30:46.086 --> 30:49.130
I've, uh... I commit too freely.

30:49.173 --> 30:51.000
I've been married a few times.

30:51.043 --> 30:52.652
I heard.

30:52.695 --> 30:54.739
I think that scared Tony.

30:54.782 --> 30:56.478
My guess is,

30:56.521 --> 31:00.826
he's chosen to take
the opposite approach to women.

31:00.869 --> 31:02.956
No commitment.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.260
It's my fault.

31:05.304 --> 31:07.347
But maybe he's changing.

31:07.391 --> 31:10.043
He made the right decision
with you.

31:10.086 --> 31:12.043
Um...

31:12.086 --> 31:13.652
I really got to
get back to work.

31:19.521 --> 31:21.391
[door closes]

31:21.434 --> 31:23.652
McGEE:
Well, we know
she has a history of drug abuse.

31:23.695 --> 31:25.260
Well, the million-dollar
question is,

31:25.304 --> 31:27.608
was it an accidental overdose,
or was she helped?

31:27.652 --> 31:29.304
We got video
of her pleading for help.

31:29.347 --> 31:32.173
Plus, the car was wiped clean.Murder, Leon.

31:32.217 --> 31:34.086
Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs,
Gibbs. Director,

31:34.130 --> 31:36.086
Director, Director.Abbs, what have you got?

31:36.130 --> 31:39.347
Um, Ducky sent me
a sexual assault kit...

31:39.391 --> 31:41.000
Whoa.
...on the victim.

31:41.043 --> 31:42.478
And I got a DNA match.

31:42.521 --> 31:45.782
"Jamie Rivers.
Assault and Battery."

31:45.826 --> 31:48.217
Getting background information
now. Excuse me, Abbs.

31:48.260 --> 31:51.000
He the driver?
Five, 11, 170.

31:51.043 --> 31:53.652
Matches the description Abby got
from the gas station video.

31:53.695 --> 31:55.478
McGEE:
All right, I can
tie him to the ATF.

31:55.521 --> 31:58.086
Jamie Rivers
was arrested in 2008

31:58.130 --> 32:00.130
for illegal sale of firearms.

32:00.173 --> 32:03.695
McGee, ATF agent on the left--
he look familiar?

32:06.130 --> 32:08.217
It's Agent Caffey,
Zoe Keates' friend.

32:08.260 --> 32:09.739
Caffey had a history
with the shooter,

32:09.782 --> 32:12.130
and he doesn't mention it.

32:17.565 --> 32:20.043
McGEE:
We've been trying to get a hold
of Special Agent Caffey,

32:20.086 --> 32:22.043
but all we have
on the suspect is a name--

32:22.086 --> 32:25.521
Jamie Rivers-- but it's like
this guy doesn't even exist.

32:25.565 --> 32:26.652
Driver's license?Last one

32:26.695 --> 32:29.217
was in Arizona. Revoked 2012.

32:29.260 --> 32:31.043
Address?Again, Arizona,

32:31.086 --> 32:32.478
but that was four years ago.
There's no indication

32:32.521 --> 32:35.521
this guy has ever been
in the DC metro area.

32:35.565 --> 32:38.130
Emma Vickers' body
is all the indication I need.

32:38.173 --> 32:40.130
All right,
we know Rivers is a bad dude.

32:40.173 --> 32:42.565
He must've had a run-in with
law enforcement at some time.

32:44.521 --> 32:46.434
Tony, you got a visitor.

32:46.478 --> 32:47.869
You're the
man, Chris.

32:47.913 --> 32:49.304
Eleanor.

32:49.347 --> 32:51.304
Tim.Hey. I thought...

32:51.347 --> 32:53.086
I thought you were out looking
for apartments.

32:53.130 --> 32:54.565
I have got great news.

32:54.608 --> 32:56.043
I couldn't wait.
I wanted to see

32:56.086 --> 32:57.956
the expression
on your face.What?

32:58.000 --> 33:00.608
Oh, I love it
when-when a plan comes together.

33:00.652 --> 33:02.956
You found a place? Great.Yeah.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.869
Where is it?You won't believe
our luck.

33:04.913 --> 33:06.304
It's in your building.

33:06.347 --> 33:08.130
I don't... I don't...

33:08.173 --> 33:09.913
What do you mean?Oh, it's the unit

33:09.956 --> 33:11.652
directly above you.

33:11.695 --> 33:14.086
Huh?

33:14.130 --> 33:16.782
In 2008, I arrested
a young Jamie Rivers in Tucson

33:16.826 --> 33:18.869
for an illegal gun sale.

33:18.913 --> 33:20.478
And we were just mounting

33:20.521 --> 33:23.000
the Fast and the Furious sting,
and...

33:23.043 --> 33:24.826
and we needed
credible straw buyers

33:24.869 --> 33:26.478
who could get guns into Mexico.

33:26.521 --> 33:28.000
So you cut him a deal?

33:28.043 --> 33:30.521
Yeah. Suspended sentence,
he goes to work for us.

33:30.565 --> 33:33.695
How did he end up
with our murder weapon?When the guns walked,

33:33.739 --> 33:35.913
Rivers led us to believe that
the gun with the serial number

33:35.956 --> 33:37.826
in question went to the cartel.

33:37.869 --> 33:39.260
Must have stuck to his fingers.

33:39.304 --> 33:41.695
When was the last time
you had contact with him?

33:41.739 --> 33:43.217
Five years ago.

33:43.260 --> 33:45.652
After the sting went south,
ATF lost all track

33:45.695 --> 33:48.000
of Rivers and most
of our straw buyers.

33:48.043 --> 33:50.043
Wow, this just gets worse
and worse.

33:50.086 --> 33:54.086
Director Vance, I had no idea
Rivers was in the DC area.

33:54.130 --> 33:56.173
Keep yourself available,
Agent Caffey.

33:56.217 --> 33:58.000
Yes, sir.

33:59.695 --> 34:01.173
You still trust
this guy?

34:01.217 --> 34:02.173
I do.

34:02.217 --> 34:03.695
We need to find Jamie Rivers.

34:06.217 --> 34:09.956
You know, leopards don't change
their spots.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.565
If Rivers was dealing
illegal weapons in Arizona,

34:11.608 --> 34:13.217
he's probably doing
the same thing here.

34:13.260 --> 34:14.565
I have a local informant
I've been working.

34:14.608 --> 34:16.391
Maybe he's come across Rivers.

34:24.043 --> 34:26.521
[crying]

34:26.565 --> 34:28.608
[sniffling]

34:30.478 --> 34:32.478
That's Emma.

34:34.304 --> 34:36.130
I'm so sorry.

34:36.173 --> 34:39.043
[sniffles]
It's not like I
didn't expect this.

34:39.086 --> 34:41.521
Um...
[sniffles]

34:41.565 --> 34:45.173
I tried to get her help,
but nothing seemed to work.

34:45.217 --> 34:47.521
[sniffles]

34:47.565 --> 34:50.260
She was such
a sweet little girl.

34:50.304 --> 34:51.695
[sniffles]

34:51.739 --> 34:54.130
Loved to draw horses.
[sniffling]

35:03.304 --> 35:07.086
Is the marine who was killed
trying to help her here?

35:07.130 --> 35:11.695
No. His remains have been
returned to his family.

35:11.739 --> 35:12.869
What was his name?

35:12.913 --> 35:13.956
Lance Corporal
David Austin.

35:17.565 --> 35:19.260
Emma's grandparents left her
a college fund,

35:19.304 --> 35:21.521
and, uh, because
of her troubles,

35:21.565 --> 35:23.173
she wasn't able
to use it.

35:23.217 --> 35:24.608
I would like
to donate that money,

35:24.652 --> 35:26.217
in Lance Corporal Austin's name,

35:26.260 --> 35:27.913
to help needy marines.

35:27.956 --> 35:30.304
Well, the Marine Corps
Scholarship Foundation

35:30.347 --> 35:32.521
is a wonderful organization.

35:35.652 --> 35:38.521
We're investigating a murder,
Director.

35:38.565 --> 35:41.782
No. NCIS is not trying
to reopen anything.

35:41.826 --> 35:44.434
One of the straw buyers
in your Fast and Furious sting

35:44.478 --> 35:46.217
ended up with our murder weapon.

35:46.260 --> 35:49.826
We will follow the leads
wherever they take us.

35:49.869 --> 35:52.130
I'm sorry if this is
an embarrassment to your agency.

35:52.173 --> 35:54.521
We...

35:54.565 --> 35:58.260
We'll talk.

35:58.304 --> 36:00.608
Well, that went well.

36:00.652 --> 36:03.000
ATF played with fire.

36:03.043 --> 36:06.000
[phone rings][groans]

36:06.043 --> 36:08.000
Yes, Pamela.

36:08.043 --> 36:09.826
Ah.

36:09.869 --> 36:12.826
Send her in. Agent Keates.

36:17.043 --> 36:19.217
I connected with my informant.

36:19.260 --> 36:21.521
Rivers hassold
weapons in the area.

36:21.565 --> 36:23.260
Mostly to drug dealers.

36:23.304 --> 36:26.652
Problem is he's now using
their product.

36:26.695 --> 36:28.347
Rivers has become an addict.

36:28.391 --> 36:29.956
Makes him much more dangerous.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.913
Did your source tell you
where you could find him?

36:31.956 --> 36:33.000
No.

36:34.304 --> 36:35.739
Can he set up a buy with Rivers?

36:37.217 --> 36:39.652
He can certainly try.

36:44.217 --> 36:46.652
[birds chirping]

36:48.086 --> 36:50.260
GIBBS:
Got something, DiNozzo?

36:50.304 --> 36:53.000
Yeah. But it's not Rivers.

36:55.086 --> 36:57.043
Hmm.

36:57.086 --> 36:59.086
[chuckles]
Look at him down there.

36:59.130 --> 37:02.478
McGee in the role
of black-market gun buyer?

37:02.521 --> 37:06.826
That's the worst casting since
Kevin Costner in Robin Hood.

37:06.869 --> 37:08.304
Wonder what the girls
are talking about.

37:08.347 --> 37:10.782
Rivers is 15 minutes late.

37:10.826 --> 37:12.608
Yeah, well, he's
a strung-out weapons dealer.

37:12.652 --> 37:14.913
Not the most reliable sort.

37:17.173 --> 37:20.304
Can I ask you something?

37:20.347 --> 37:21.260
Sure.

37:21.304 --> 37:22.869
Did Tony say anything about us

37:22.913 --> 37:25.000
having trouble working together?

37:25.043 --> 37:27.260
There a problem?

37:27.304 --> 37:28.652
I don't know.

37:28.695 --> 37:31.391
I mean, I thought
everything was good, but...

37:31.434 --> 37:33.608
I don't know.
Something's changed.

37:33.652 --> 37:37.391
Hmm. Well, Tony's a...

37:37.434 --> 37:39.434
complicated guy.

37:39.478 --> 37:40.695
[both chuckle]

37:40.739 --> 37:42.695
Yeah. So's his father.

37:42.739 --> 37:45.956
Yeah.Said he was glad
Tony made a commitment to me.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.869
Senior said that?

37:47.913 --> 37:49.478
Yeah.

37:49.521 --> 37:50.521
You tell Tony?

37:50.565 --> 37:52.869
Not yet.

37:52.913 --> 37:54.260
[phone ringing]

37:54.304 --> 37:56.739
You gonna get that?

37:59.217 --> 38:01.652
[sighs heavily]

38:02.695 --> 38:03.913
It's my dad.

38:03.956 --> 38:06.260
I can't deal
with that right now.

38:06.304 --> 38:08.260
I've resolved myself to the fact
that he needs to live near me,

38:08.304 --> 38:10.260
but having my father
in my building would be the end

38:10.304 --> 38:11.913
of my life as I know it.

38:11.956 --> 38:13.869
You got to talk.

38:15.173 --> 38:16.521
Got to say what you think.

38:16.565 --> 38:18.217
Yeah.

38:18.260 --> 38:21.217
Well, the timing's
really bad.

38:21.260 --> 38:25.304
[sighs]
There's other stuff
going on.

38:25.347 --> 38:28.130
The honeymoon period with Zoe
might be over.

38:28.173 --> 38:31.652
BISHOP:
Tony, the mic on your walkie
is open.

38:35.173 --> 38:36.739
Your father's not the only one
you need

38:36.782 --> 38:38.304
to communicate with, DiNozzo.

38:38.347 --> 38:39.739
Um...

38:39.782 --> 38:41.869
can we do this later?

38:41.913 --> 38:44.913
McGEE:
Anyone else watching?
I'm out here by myself.

38:44.956 --> 38:47.173
Got a guy approaching from
the rear on a bicycle wearing

38:47.217 --> 38:48.739
a baseball hat.
Looks like the same one Rivers

38:48.782 --> 38:52.391
had on
in the gas station video.

38:52.434 --> 38:54.565
TONY:
Yeah, that's Rivers.

38:54.608 --> 38:55.739
Showtime?

39:04.956 --> 39:06.608
Gibbs, we got a problem
on our end.

39:06.652 --> 39:09.608
Two mounted rangers approaching
from the south.

39:11.347 --> 39:14.956
Bishop, we're going in. Identify
yourself to the rangers.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.260
Let 'em know what we're doing.

39:16.304 --> 39:18.260
[engine revving]

39:25.217 --> 39:26.521
NCIS!

39:28.130 --> 39:29.260
Freeze!

39:38.521 --> 39:39.652
That's the make of
the murder weapon.

39:42.869 --> 39:45.695
And there's the one
he was gonna sell.

40:00.782 --> 40:02.695
Okay.

40:02.739 --> 40:04.521
So...

40:04.565 --> 40:07.000
I'm glad we talked.

40:07.043 --> 40:09.086
Me, too.

40:09.130 --> 40:10.434
It was important.

40:10.478 --> 40:12.869
It was.

40:12.913 --> 40:15.000
We're just not finished yet.

40:15.043 --> 40:16.391
But we're good?

40:16.434 --> 40:17.652
I hope so.

40:17.695 --> 40:19.043
[sighs]

40:19.086 --> 40:21.043
I just want to apologize
for my...

40:21.086 --> 40:22.956
behavior.

40:23.000 --> 40:26.695
Things always get complicated
for me when my father's in town.

40:26.739 --> 40:29.608
You can't blame everything
on your father, Tony.

40:29.652 --> 40:33.652
I know. But...
[groans]

40:33.695 --> 40:35.478
When you say
"we're not finished,"

40:35.521 --> 40:37.782
it's nothing serious, right?

40:37.826 --> 40:39.347
No.

40:39.391 --> 40:41.782
I want us to work.

40:41.826 --> 40:43.434
Me, too.

40:43.478 --> 40:47.043
Come here.

40:47.086 --> 40:49.869
Oh.
[grunting]

40:49.913 --> 40:51.782
[laughs]

40:51.826 --> 40:54.260
Mmm.

40:56.782 --> 40:58.130
Want to come upstairs?

40:58.173 --> 41:00.434
No. You're on your own with him.

41:10.217 --> 41:11.130
Join me?

41:11.173 --> 41:13.695
Yeah. I could use a drink.

41:13.739 --> 41:14.869
Tough day?

41:14.913 --> 41:18.000
You could say that.

41:18.043 --> 41:20.043
You want to talk about it?

41:20.086 --> 41:22.043
No, not really.

41:22.086 --> 41:23.478
Oh.

41:23.521 --> 41:25.695
You put the furniture back, huh?

41:25.739 --> 41:27.173
Yeah, I liked it
the way it was,

41:27.217 --> 41:30.086
but, uh, it's your place.

41:33.565 --> 41:36.000
You, uh... you look troubled.

41:36.043 --> 41:39.043
Oh, Dad. We got to talk.

41:39.086 --> 41:40.217
Me first.

41:42.217 --> 41:44.478
I don't know
what I was thinking.

41:44.521 --> 41:46.913
Of course I know
what I was thinking.

41:46.956 --> 41:48.652
I was thinking about myself.

41:48.695 --> 41:50.652
'Cause I'm selfish.

41:50.695 --> 41:51.956
Dad.Junior,
listen,

41:52.000 --> 41:53.695
it's taken
too long

41:53.739 --> 41:56.347
for me to realize that you have
to live your own life.

41:56.391 --> 41:59.000
I want to be
near you,

41:59.043 --> 42:02.782
and I'm going to be
but not in your building.

42:04.826 --> 42:06.956
You need your space.

42:07.000 --> 42:10.695
I'd like to disagree with you,
but I'm not going to

42:10.739 --> 42:13.173
because you're right.

42:15.347 --> 42:16.913
Thanks.

42:16.956 --> 42:19.043
Now, what did you want
to talk to me about?

42:19.086 --> 42:22.434
Well, you've pretty much
said it all.

42:22.478 --> 42:24.260
Why don't you spend
the weekend here

42:24.304 --> 42:26.260
and I can help you look
for an apartment.

42:26.304 --> 42:28.217
Do you know if there's any...

42:28.260 --> 42:31.782
swanky senior residences
in this area?
