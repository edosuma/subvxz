00:37.565 --> 00:39.446
Previously on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:39.471 --> 00:40.837
Maybe having a baby

00:40.862 --> 00:41.829
started out as a whim,

00:41.854 --> 00:43.961
but it's what I want for my life now.

00:43.986 --> 00:45.218
And you don't want a baby.

00:45.220 --> 00:47.087
Oh, wait, so this is... ?

00:47.089 --> 00:48.421
Yeah, I guess it is.

00:48.446 --> 00:50.890
JOSH: Why are you making me move?

00:50.892 --> 00:52.092
I don't want to move.

00:52.094 --> 00:53.760
I'm just going through a tough time.

00:53.762 --> 00:56.173
- Too much change.
- Josh is the worst.

00:56.205 --> 00:58.304
You know, I can't even book
another wedding because of him.

00:58.329 --> 01:00.841
His jilting you has
completely ruined my business.

01:00.843 --> 01:02.999
Can I help you, ma'am?

01:03.024 --> 01:04.897
Me and Ally? I wish.

01:04.923 --> 01:07.257
I don't have a shot.
I mean, look at her.

01:07.259 --> 01:08.658
There's no baby.

01:08.660 --> 01:11.194
It is really expensive
to buy those huevos.

01:11.196 --> 01:12.896
I can only do it, like, once a year.

01:12.898 --> 01:14.164
REBECCA: The way I am with Nathaniel

01:14.166 --> 01:16.595
is nothing like the way I was with Josh.

01:16.620 --> 01:19.202
But doesn't it feel like you're
repeating some old patterns?

01:19.774 --> 01:20.904
Rebecca, what's wrong?

01:20.906 --> 01:22.872
I have to do something
I've never done before.

01:22.874 --> 01:26.157
What? (exhales)

01:27.329 --> 01:28.729
Come on in.

01:29.142 --> 01:30.513
You look upset.

01:31.892 --> 01:34.117
So, you said you wanted to do something

01:34.119 --> 01:35.345
you'd never done before.

01:35.370 --> 01:37.336
What is it, like a sex thing?

01:37.735 --> 01:39.856
I mean, I don't know what else
is still on the table for us.

01:39.858 --> 01:42.325
(laughs) Oh, God, please
don't make me laugh.

01:43.345 --> 01:45.400
Oh, it's only gonna
make it more difficult.

01:45.876 --> 01:47.263
What do you mean?

01:47.265 --> 01:50.204
Okay. Okay, so here's the thing.

01:51.540 --> 01:53.136
I don't know how to like someone

01:53.138 --> 01:54.204
without being obsessed with them.

01:54.206 --> 01:55.472
Okay? So...

01:55.474 --> 01:57.256
it happened with Josh

01:57.281 --> 01:58.475
and now it's starting
to happen with you,

01:58.477 --> 01:59.843
and I can't go down that road again.

01:59.845 --> 02:00.810
It's a nightmare.

02:00.812 --> 02:02.779
Okay, well, I'm not Josh.

02:02.781 --> 02:04.681
(chuckles) Okay?

02:04.683 --> 02:05.982
This isn't bad obsessed.

02:05.984 --> 02:07.150
This is good obsessed.

02:07.152 --> 02:08.318
I-I-I like it.

02:08.320 --> 02:09.519
I-I find it flattering.

02:09.520 --> 02:10.787
No, no, but, Nathaniel,

02:10.788 --> 02:12.689
think about all the stuff I
did just in the last few days.

02:12.691 --> 02:13.690
I mean, really,

02:13.692 --> 02:15.183
I-I hounded your father.

02:15.208 --> 02:17.427
I insisted you had a secret sibling.

02:17.630 --> 02:20.196
I stole your shirt so I could
wear it all day and smell it.

02:20.198 --> 02:22.332
Look, we talked about all that.

02:22.334 --> 02:23.497
It's in the past.

02:23.668 --> 02:25.368
And I didn't know about the shirt thing,

02:25.370 --> 02:27.103
but, again, kind of cute.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.805
Okay, cute, yes, it starts out as cute,

02:28.807 --> 02:30.106
but then it escalates.

02:30.108 --> 02:31.508
It escalates to-to bad things,

02:31.510 --> 02:33.543
like-like burning down houses

02:33.545 --> 02:35.725
and abducting some people's moms

02:35.750 --> 02:37.614
and sleeping with other people's dads.

02:37.616 --> 02:39.250
- Whoa, what?
- Not your dad.

02:39.275 --> 02:41.117
Although, I mean, he does have kind of

02:41.119 --> 02:42.419
like a silver fox thing going on.

02:42.421 --> 02:43.420
He's very neggy, which I like.

02:43.422 --> 02:45.922
Point is, the point is...

02:47.726 --> 02:51.227
I-I just can't be with
you right now... or anyone.

02:51.229 --> 02:52.662
Okay, look, I-I don't
want to get in the way

02:52.664 --> 02:54.197
of your therapy thing,
but isn't the whole point

02:54.199 --> 02:55.965
of all this to be happy?

02:55.967 --> 02:57.967
We're happy. That's what matters.

02:57.969 --> 03:00.095
I'm happy, but it's not real.

03:00.799 --> 03:03.540
It's... it's a high.

03:03.542 --> 03:05.542
- It's infatuation.
- Wait.

03:05.682 --> 03:09.913
Are... are you breaking
up with me right now?

03:09.915 --> 03:11.681
No. No, no, no, no, no.

03:11.683 --> 03:13.479
I'm just saying that we...

03:15.158 --> 03:18.488
... I'm just saying that we
can't be together or go out

03:18.490 --> 03:22.192
or talk on the phone or have sex

03:22.194 --> 03:26.296
or... kiss or snuggle or cuddle.

03:26.572 --> 03:28.398
Um...

03:28.400 --> 03:29.532
so, I'm sorry.

03:29.534 --> 03:30.733
(crying): I have to, I
have to, I have to go.

03:30.735 --> 03:31.734
No, no, no, wait, Rebecca.

03:31.736 --> 03:33.329
You can't just...

03:38.343 --> 03:39.930
The hell just happened?

03:42.013 --> 03:44.013
REBECCA: So, I can't do anything.

03:44.015 --> 03:46.182
I can't be in a romantic relationship

03:46.184 --> 03:48.952
because I'm literally incapable of it.

03:48.954 --> 03:51.153
And I'm not ready to go back to work,

03:51.178 --> 03:53.178
so I got nothing to do all day.

03:54.035 --> 03:55.792
You know what I did yesterday?

03:55.794 --> 03:57.760
I-I threw out all my old
spices and bought new ones.

03:57.762 --> 03:58.895
I don't even cook.

03:58.897 --> 04:00.130
I just smelled them all

04:00.132 --> 04:01.731
and I tried to smoke the marjoram.

04:01.733 --> 04:05.068
Rebecca, you made a hard
choice ending your relationship.

04:05.070 --> 04:06.769
Now you have some time on your hands.

04:07.105 --> 04:09.139
It's a good opportunity to maybe

04:09.164 --> 04:11.085
fill in some of these gaps in your life.

04:11.110 --> 04:12.796
Find meaning in new ways.

04:12.821 --> 04:14.328
You know, some of my patients

04:14.353 --> 04:17.719
find meaning by giving back to
the community, helping others.

04:17.744 --> 04:20.516
- Hmm. Like volunteer stuff?
- Yeah, it can be very therapeutic

04:20.541 --> 04:21.789
and rewarding.

04:21.814 --> 04:24.571
I have this one patient who
volunteered at a library,

04:24.596 --> 04:26.524
then started a book exchange program,

04:26.549 --> 04:28.250
then ended up writing a book about that.

04:28.275 --> 04:30.289
Then she donated the
proceeds of the book...

04:30.321 --> 04:32.304
Okay, we get it. She's
your favorite patient.

04:32.329 --> 04:34.719
- You want to kiss her. La, la, la.
- Yeah, you got me.

04:34.744 --> 04:37.696
She's my favorite patient and
I want to kiss her, la, la, la.

04:37.743 --> 04:39.009
Rebecca.

04:39.011 --> 04:42.179
Think of all the time and
energy you spend in your life

04:42.181 --> 04:43.480
on romantic relationships.

04:43.482 --> 04:45.457
I have clocked a lot of hours.

04:45.482 --> 04:48.896
Okay. You can take that
passion, that intensity,

04:48.921 --> 04:52.356
and focus and redirect it
into more productive endeavors.

04:52.358 --> 04:53.597
Huh.

04:55.349 --> 04:57.249
God, I've never thought of that before.

04:58.697 --> 05:00.316
Maybe you're right.

So, Darryl and I agreed
that we should be friends,

08:13.125 --> 08:15.625
but then I've texted him a couple times

08:15.627 --> 08:17.594
and he hasn't texted me back all day.

08:17.596 --> 08:19.896
I just... I... I feel like friends

08:19.898 --> 08:20.997
should text friends back.

08:20.999 --> 08:23.800
Sure, but you guys are not friends.

08:23.802 --> 08:25.168
He just dumped you, dude.

08:25.170 --> 08:26.403
What are you talking about?

08:26.405 --> 08:27.694
I didn't get dumped.

08:28.601 --> 08:29.840
It was mutual.

08:29.842 --> 08:32.008
(laughs) Yeah, right. Mutual.

08:32.010 --> 08:33.876
You take back those air quotes.

08:33.879 --> 08:35.010
Okay.

08:35.013 --> 08:36.546
- Joshua.
- Dude.

08:36.548 --> 08:38.977
Everyone knows there's no
such thing as a mutual breakup.

08:39.001 --> 08:40.549
Yes, there is.

08:40.552 --> 08:42.652
Okay, so, maybe he said
the words technically

08:42.654 --> 08:45.121
before I said the
words, but it's like when

08:45.123 --> 08:46.623
you're on the phone and
you're having a conversation,

08:46.625 --> 08:48.381
and you want that conversation to end,

08:48.406 --> 08:49.826
someone has to say the word "good-bye"

08:49.828 --> 08:51.094
before the other person says good-bye,

08:51.096 --> 08:52.128
but you're doing it together.

08:52.130 --> 08:53.196
Who talks on the phone?

08:53.198 --> 08:54.197
What, are you like a hundred?

08:54.199 --> 08:55.298
Oh, my God.

08:55.300 --> 08:56.933
Thank you.

08:56.935 --> 08:57.901
Oh, I-I got it.

08:57.903 --> 08:59.002
Dude, what's that?

08:59.004 --> 09:02.105
Uh... oh. Since when do you have money?

09:02.107 --> 09:03.373
I got a job.

09:03.375 --> 09:04.941
Doing what?

09:06.454 --> 09:09.279
I'm... a... fireman.

09:09.633 --> 09:11.948
A volunteer fireman.

09:11.950 --> 09:15.151
Wait, so you get paid to volunteer?

09:15.153 --> 09:18.955
Yeah, I save lives for money
and I got to go, so good...

09:18.957 --> 09:20.290
Good-bye.

09:20.292 --> 09:21.820
See? We just did it.

09:21.845 --> 09:23.378
Mutual.

09:25.410 --> 09:27.544
(sighs)

09:30.168 --> 09:31.768
(sighs)

09:31.770 --> 09:33.970
There he is.

09:33.972 --> 09:35.639
Get in here.

09:35.641 --> 09:38.008
Oh, that's what I need.
A big old Paula hug

09:38.010 --> 09:41.111
because... Because your
fertilization didn't take again?

09:41.451 --> 09:43.947
Another wasted egg. I'm sorry.

09:43.949 --> 09:44.981
Now, how did you know that?

09:44.983 --> 09:46.249
I just found out myself.

09:46.251 --> 09:48.084
- Mrs. Hernandez.
- What?

09:48.086 --> 09:50.153
She listens in on all
the Whitefeather calls

09:50.155 --> 09:51.521
like an old-timey operator.

09:51.523 --> 09:53.456
I call her Mrs. Hearnandez.

09:53.458 --> 09:56.693
But she's right. I mean,
my sperm is just way too active.

09:56.695 --> 09:58.929
I have a medical condition
called super sperm.

09:58.931 --> 10:01.031
Who named that condition?
A ten-year-old doctor?

10:01.033 --> 10:03.166
My sperm is just too strong.

10:03.168 --> 10:04.401
I mean, it gets in the Petri dish

10:04.403 --> 10:06.503
and it just whizzes around going, Aah!

10:06.505 --> 10:07.504
Banging into the glass.

10:07.506 --> 10:09.205
It's like a bird flying into a window

10:09.207 --> 10:10.373
over and over.

10:10.375 --> 10:12.642
Okay, no, you have weird goop. I get it.

10:12.644 --> 10:14.144
And I can't afford another egg.

10:14.146 --> 10:15.378
They're so expensive.

10:15.380 --> 10:18.181
I've already sold my whole
Southwestern collection.

10:18.183 --> 10:20.317
I considered moving onto
my Southeastern collection,

10:20.319 --> 10:22.319
but that's really just
a Miami Vice T-shirt

10:22.321 --> 10:24.154
and a stuffed moccasin snake.

10:24.156 --> 10:25.488
Well, you have other stuff to sell.

10:25.490 --> 10:26.656
What about your above-ground pool?

10:26.658 --> 10:27.991
Oh, it's riddled with spiders.

10:27.993 --> 10:29.793
- Calf-massager ottoman?
- Broke months ago.

10:29.795 --> 10:32.829
- Electric soft-bonnet hair dryer?
- I can't get rid of that.

10:32.831 --> 10:34.831
I mean, how do you expect
me to have this shine,

10:34.833 --> 10:37.801
this volume, this lustrous texture?

10:37.803 --> 10:39.035
- Darryl?
- Hmm?

10:39.037 --> 10:40.136
I know you.

10:40.318 --> 10:44.387
And if you want this,
you will find a way.

10:48.688 --> 10:49.913
Hey, guys, guess what.

10:50.048 --> 10:54.150
Maya had a three-way and
Tim's mother has diabetes.

10:55.187 --> 10:57.253
Are you sick of limp, dull hair?

10:57.255 --> 10:59.723
Because if you are,
all you need is the trusty...

10:59.725 --> 11:01.257
soft-bonnet hair dryer.

11:01.259 --> 11:05.395
And it can be yours for just $500.

11:05.397 --> 11:06.463
No, thanks.

11:06.465 --> 11:08.164
Oh, please? I am so desperate for cash.

11:08.166 --> 11:11.227
Sorry. I need to get back to work.

11:12.871 --> 11:13.937
JIM: Hey.

11:13.939 --> 11:15.705
- Hey. Psst, hey.
- Turn around.

11:15.707 --> 11:17.540
- Psst. Come here. Over here.
- Hey. Hey.

11:17.542 --> 11:18.908
- Come talk to us. Psst.
- Hey. Hey. Psst.

11:18.910 --> 11:20.710
- Hey.
- Psst. Hey.

11:20.712 --> 11:22.579
Heard you're looking
for a little cheese?

11:22.581 --> 11:24.447
Oh, I never want just a little cheese.

11:24.449 --> 11:25.749
I mean, I get a muenster open,

11:25.751 --> 11:27.851
and I'll just finish the whole thing.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.052
- What?
- What?

11:29.054 --> 11:31.953
The red hat dance is at midnight.

11:32.624 --> 11:33.456
Huh?

11:33.458 --> 11:35.759
Meet us here at 2:00 a.m.

11:35.761 --> 11:36.793
But you said midnight.

11:36.795 --> 11:37.827
That's an expression.

11:37.829 --> 11:38.895
And bring two bills.

11:38.897 --> 11:39.796
What?

11:39.798 --> 11:40.764
20 Hamiltons?

11:40.766 --> 11:41.898
MRS. HERNANDEZ: Oh, God.

11:41.900 --> 11:43.733
We're playing poker
tomorrow night at 2:00 a.m.

11:43.735 --> 11:45.135
Bring $200.

11:45.137 --> 11:46.236
Yeah.

11:46.238 --> 11:47.704
You can try to win some
of the money Tim needs

11:47.706 --> 11:48.938
for his big old dying mom.

11:48.940 --> 11:50.607
We play for keeps.

11:50.609 --> 11:52.263
For keeps...

11:55.074 --> 11:56.707
I'm in.

11:58.283 --> 12:00.517
So I was thinking that I could
volunteer at a soup kitchen,

12:00.519 --> 12:02.102
but you know how I feel about soup.

12:02.127 --> 12:03.753
Then, I was thinking adult literacy,

12:03.755 --> 12:05.522
but if they can't read by
the time they're adults,

12:05.524 --> 12:06.790
I mean, there's something
else going on there,

12:06.792 --> 12:07.924
and I cannot take that on.

12:07.926 --> 12:09.059
Then, I thought I could sort clothes

12:09.061 --> 12:10.460
at a donation center.

12:10.462 --> 12:13.396
Eh... if I see one crusty
stain, I'm not eating for weeks.

12:13.398 --> 12:14.831
Wow, your altruism is really incredible.

12:14.833 --> 12:15.932
Thank you.

12:15.934 --> 12:17.033
Hola, chicas.

12:17.035 --> 12:18.737
Thanks for letting me use your Internet.

12:18.762 --> 12:20.904
- Mm-hmm.
- Can you believe that coffee shop?

12:20.906 --> 12:22.739
I need to buy something? (scoffs)

12:22.741 --> 12:23.873
(A) I don't have any money.

12:23.875 --> 12:24.974
(B) I don't have any money.

12:24.976 --> 12:27.110
(C) How many times do I need to say it?

12:27.135 --> 12:28.167
No money.

12:28.192 --> 12:30.215
I cannot buy your eight-dollar scones.

12:30.615 --> 12:32.782
Wait, I thought you booked
that engagement party.

12:32.784 --> 12:34.788
I did, but it's pretty low-budg,

12:34.813 --> 12:36.686
and I don't get all my
money until it's over.

12:36.688 --> 12:38.822
So, I have to do everything by myself.

12:38.824 --> 12:40.390
I have no help.

12:40.392 --> 12:42.892
This party-planning business,
it's not exactly thriving.

12:42.894 --> 12:45.328
And you refuse to do anything for free.

12:45.330 --> 12:46.496
Yeah, I suck.

12:46.498 --> 12:48.031
Wait, you're looking for help?

12:48.033 --> 12:49.099
You need free help?

12:49.101 --> 12:50.833
So you're looking for a volunteer.

12:51.603 --> 12:53.303
Um, I'll do it.

12:53.305 --> 12:55.138
Yes. Hooray.

12:55.140 --> 12:56.005
Get excited.

12:56.007 --> 12:57.640
This is kismet, this is bashert.

12:57.642 --> 13:00.009
That's Jew for kismet. I'm in!

13:00.011 --> 13:01.377
I'll do it! I'll help!

13:01.379 --> 13:02.812
What are we doing again?

13:12.185 --> 13:13.872
Uh... (blows raspberry)

13:13.897 --> 13:15.564
Who ordered these for me?

13:15.617 --> 13:17.583
I did not order them.

13:17.756 --> 13:18.988
(laughs)

13:18.990 --> 13:20.056
I mean... (coughs)

13:20.058 --> 13:21.457
Well, now... (coughs)

13:21.459 --> 13:23.493
that I've coughed on 'em,
I should probably just...

13:23.495 --> 13:25.091
eat 'em.

13:25.497 --> 13:26.863
(sighs)

13:30.117 --> 13:31.182
I'm not eating fries.

13:31.184 --> 13:32.317
Oh, God. Me neither.

13:32.319 --> 13:34.319
Yuck. I said celery.

13:34.321 --> 13:36.054
The service here is wack!

13:36.056 --> 13:37.388
How have you been?

13:37.687 --> 13:41.059
Haven't seen you around the office
since you, uh, got dumped.

13:41.061 --> 13:43.132
Dumped? Who said that?
Was it Mrs. Hernandez?

13:43.157 --> 13:46.326
She's a filthy liar.
No. No, it was mutual.

13:46.328 --> 13:48.995
That is a thing. You
know? A mutual breakup.

13:48.997 --> 13:50.963
Oh, you don't have to
explain that to me. (chuckles)

13:50.965 --> 13:53.066
I'm going through the same
thing right now with Rebecca.

13:53.068 --> 13:55.201
A mutual... parting.

13:55.203 --> 13:56.736
See? You know what I'm talking about.

13:56.738 --> 13:58.338
And also, as if someone like Rebecca

13:58.340 --> 14:00.039
would be the one to break
up with someone like you.

14:00.041 --> 14:02.809
I mean, you're you and she's... her.

14:02.811 --> 14:04.744
The same, if-if not more so about you.

14:04.746 --> 14:05.945
I mean... (scoffs)

14:05.947 --> 14:07.213
As if Darryl...

14:07.677 --> 14:09.010
Darryl. Yeah.

14:09.184 --> 14:10.483
Darryl?

14:10.485 --> 14:12.385
- Darryl.
- Okay, I did date him.

14:12.387 --> 14:15.955
I-I'm just saying that he's in
no position to turn you down.

14:15.957 --> 14:18.825
- At all.
- Um, excuse me, did one of you guys

14:18.827 --> 14:21.160
call one of my servers wack?

14:21.162 --> 14:22.606
Hmm?

14:23.698 --> 14:24.988
Yes...

14:25.013 --> 14:26.599
So, A) What decade are we in?

14:26.601 --> 14:28.601
And B) You did not order celery,

14:28.603 --> 14:30.837
you literally ordered fries.

14:30.839 --> 14:32.472
And so did you.

14:32.474 --> 14:35.475
I... Do you need me to rewind
the security camera footage?

14:35.477 --> 14:37.510
No. No, thank you.

14:37.512 --> 14:39.412
- Okay.
- WHITE JOSH: Sorry.

14:39.414 --> 14:40.880
(whistles) Okay.

14:40.882 --> 14:43.182
(laughing): So we
ordered fries. You know?

14:43.184 --> 14:44.384
Yeah. So, you know,

14:44.386 --> 14:46.486
despite the, uh, mutual-ness
of our breakups,

14:46.488 --> 14:48.421
we were still feeling a little bit down.

14:48.423 --> 14:49.756
You know? We're only human.

14:49.758 --> 14:51.553
Are we, though?

14:51.578 --> 14:54.594
I mean, people like you and
me, we don't eat disgusting food

14:54.596 --> 14:56.262
to make ourselves feel better.

14:56.264 --> 14:57.563
It doesn't even work, anyway.

14:57.565 --> 14:59.465
You know, you're right. It doesn't work.

14:59.467 --> 15:01.000
You feel worse.

15:01.002 --> 15:03.736
You feel like a worthless, pathetic,

15:03.738 --> 15:05.772
flabby little fat kid who's
running around the playground,

15:05.774 --> 15:07.106
and all the kids are screaming at him

15:07.108 --> 15:08.274
and pointing at him and chasing him

15:08.276 --> 15:10.143
and calling him the Tubby
Tubster tel the time.

15:10.878 --> 15:12.712
That didn't happen to me.

15:12.714 --> 15:14.247
I heard a story about that.

15:14.249 --> 15:16.616
Ah. You know what? I have an idea.

15:16.618 --> 15:17.817
I have this new in-home

15:17.819 --> 15:20.153
gym system called the ShredFlex.

15:20.155 --> 15:22.155
- It's the newest, latest model...
- Wait, wait, wait.

15:22.157 --> 15:24.290
- The ShredFlex 5000?
- Mm-hmm.

15:24.292 --> 15:25.792
Okay. I have been trying
to get this in my gym

15:25.794 --> 15:27.334
and it has been on back-order forever.

15:27.359 --> 15:28.858
Well, I have it.

15:28.883 --> 15:30.216
In matte black.

15:30.365 --> 15:31.964
Like the Batmobile?

15:31.966 --> 15:35.134
Yes. Let's do this, man.
Let's do a seven-day cleanse

15:35.136 --> 15:37.837
and shred and flex our way into
the best shape of our lives.

15:37.839 --> 15:39.305
Yeah. That'll make us feel great.

15:39.307 --> 15:40.540
It'll make us feel amazing.

15:40.542 --> 15:41.774
- Mm-hmm.
- I love where your head's at, man.

15:41.776 --> 15:43.843
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Let's O.D. on endorphins, bro!

15:43.845 --> 15:45.011
- Yeah!
- Okay.

15:45.013 --> 15:46.112
- (grunts)
- (laughs)

15:46.114 --> 15:47.246
Hey! Idiots!

15:47.248 --> 15:48.347
- Yep. So sorry.
- Yeah, you're right.

15:48.349 --> 15:49.549
- Let's clean that up.
- Good call.

15:49.551 --> 15:51.050
Oh. We shouldn't have done that.

15:51.052 --> 15:52.018
(door opens)

15:52.020 --> 15:53.853
Hey, hey!

15:53.855 --> 15:55.188
You'll never believe this.

15:55.190 --> 15:56.322
I balanced your books.

15:56.324 --> 15:57.123
And you were right.

15:57.125 --> 15:58.724
You only have about $800...

15:58.726 --> 16:00.993
Or 100 scones... Left in the bank.

16:00.995 --> 16:01.994
And after I balanced your books,

16:01.996 --> 16:03.596
I balanced my own checkbook.

16:03.598 --> 16:07.433
And I only have about 30
scones left in the bank.

16:07.435 --> 16:11.737
It turns out, I spent tens of
thousands of dollars on Josh.

16:11.739 --> 16:14.307
Anyway, water under the bridge.
What can I do for you next?

16:14.309 --> 16:17.143
Well, I have a meeting with
the bride and groom now.

16:17.145 --> 16:19.445
Great. I will come as your
assistant. It'll be perfect.

16:19.447 --> 16:21.214
I will take notes, I will interrupt you

16:21.216 --> 16:23.015
with fake appointments
to make you look cool,

16:23.017 --> 16:23.883
I will interrupt

16:23.885 --> 16:25.184
with fake phone calls... oh.

16:25.186 --> 16:27.420
Uh, Ms. Perez, I have
Susan Faludi on line one.

16:27.422 --> 16:28.588
Yeah. Who?

16:28.590 --> 16:31.157
Susan Faludi. She wrote
Backlash. It was seminal.

16:31.159 --> 16:32.158
Anyway... please?

16:32.160 --> 16:33.526
I want to be helpful and productive.

16:33.528 --> 16:34.694
Look how snappy I look.

16:35.563 --> 16:36.629
Hmm.

16:36.631 --> 16:39.365
An assistant would make me look fancy.

16:40.435 --> 16:41.501
Okay, sure.

16:41.503 --> 16:42.468
Let's do it.

16:42.470 --> 16:44.437
NATHANIEL: Do it! Do it!

16:44.439 --> 16:46.305
Come on, five more. You got this.

16:46.307 --> 16:48.341
(straining): Oh, my arms
are starting to burn.

16:48.343 --> 16:50.109
Yeah. That's just the
fat crying out in pain.

16:50.111 --> 16:52.245
Come on, you fat little boy.

16:52.247 --> 16:54.447
You pudgy little blubber ball.

16:54.449 --> 16:56.749
Mr. Tubby Tubster!

16:56.751 --> 16:59.118
- That is so mean!
- Yeah. Three,

16:59.120 --> 17:03.256
- two... one! Come on!
- Ah...

17:03.258 --> 17:04.924
- Impressive.
- Oh, my God.

17:04.925 --> 17:06.157
Oh, thanks, man.

17:06.160 --> 17:07.926
Get in there.

17:07.929 --> 17:08.895
Here we go.

17:08.896 --> 17:11.364
What do the spikes do, exactly?

17:11.366 --> 17:13.098
Well, they scare the
fat out of your body.

17:13.101 --> 17:14.767
- Ah.
- (clears throat)

17:14.769 --> 17:17.136
- (grunts)
- There we go.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.137
- Two.
- Come on, man. Come on.

17:19.140 --> 17:21.607
- Three.
- Attaboy. Looking good.

17:22.348 --> 17:23.843
Big push.

17:23.845 --> 17:25.711
(grunts)

17:25.713 --> 17:27.035
Go! Go! Go!

17:27.060 --> 17:28.960
You call that effort, daddy's boy?

17:28.962 --> 17:31.145
Maybe if you burn off
some of that disgusting,

17:31.170 --> 17:34.672
white jiggly fat, your
father will finally love you!

17:35.035 --> 17:36.601
(shouts)

17:36.603 --> 17:37.936
There we go. There we go.

17:38.606 --> 17:40.419
(panting) You're good.

17:40.444 --> 17:42.311
Thanks.

17:43.330 --> 17:45.564
VALENCIA: Hello.

17:46.005 --> 17:48.239
Rebecca? What are you doing here?

17:48.286 --> 17:49.685
Hey. You-you guys know each other?

17:49.687 --> 17:51.120
Yeah. Oh, Marty and I go way back.

17:51.122 --> 17:53.493
He works at the market,
dusting potatoes.

17:53.518 --> 17:54.461
Not anymore.

17:54.486 --> 17:56.594
I'm a produce manager now.

17:56.664 --> 17:59.227
I like to say I'm a producer.

17:59.252 --> 18:00.729
(laughter)

18:00.731 --> 18:01.897
Ooh. Rebecca.

18:01.899 --> 18:04.016
This is Ally.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.734
Oh, my God... You're marrying Ally?

18:05.736 --> 18:07.136
I heard you were in love with her,

18:07.138 --> 18:08.604
but she was into that
rude grocery clerk.

18:08.606 --> 18:10.072
The one who came to my party.

18:10.074 --> 18:12.308
I'm not gonna say it, but
the one with, you know.

18:12.310 --> 18:14.677
Brody. Yeah. We broke up.

18:14.679 --> 18:16.445
And Marty was there.

18:16.447 --> 18:17.580
So here we are.

18:17.582 --> 18:18.847
Isn't that a great story?

18:18.849 --> 18:20.683
Oh, I love when you tell it.

18:20.685 --> 18:22.117
Mwah. (grunts)

18:22.119 --> 18:24.453
MARTY: Sorry to hear about
you and Josh, by the way.

18:24.455 --> 18:26.789
Mrs. Hernandez said it didn't work out.

18:27.054 --> 18:28.591
You know Mrs. Hernandez?

18:28.593 --> 18:31.585
She comes in on Thursdays,
buys a single peach.

18:31.929 --> 18:33.162
Strange woman.

18:33.164 --> 18:35.331
So, anyway, back to me
and my business. Yes.

18:35.333 --> 18:37.466
And your engagement party.

18:37.468 --> 18:38.934
Yeah, we're on a budget.

18:38.936 --> 18:41.036
I mean, I'm the bread
manager at the market,

18:41.038 --> 18:42.538
so I make more than Marty.

18:42.540 --> 18:44.255
So you're the breadwinner.

18:44.280 --> 18:46.375
No. I'm the bread manager.

18:46.377 --> 18:48.247
Between us, we don't
have that much dough.

18:48.272 --> 18:49.478
(laughs)

18:49.480 --> 18:50.512
(chuckles)

18:50.514 --> 18:51.847
That's funny.

18:51.849 --> 18:53.349
How is that funny?

18:53.351 --> 18:54.850
I think it's a bummer.

18:54.852 --> 18:55.918
Don't you worry.

18:55.920 --> 18:57.086
Your budget is not an issue,

18:57.088 --> 18:59.188
because we can do the event economically

18:59.190 --> 19:00.522
right here at Home Base.

19:00.524 --> 19:01.390
I call it

19:01.392 --> 19:03.158
Beer and Brats at the Base.

19:03.160 --> 19:06.056
A SoCal Oktoberfest
without the nasty Germans.

19:06.081 --> 19:08.063
Oktoberfests are very trendy right now.

19:08.065 --> 19:10.232
I heard that Prince
Harry and his Northwestern

19:10.234 --> 19:12.067
theater major fiancée
love a good O-fest.

19:12.069 --> 19:13.235
MARTY: Yeah.

19:13.237 --> 19:15.170
That sounds really great.

19:15.172 --> 19:16.238
Uh...

19:16.240 --> 19:17.940
What do you think, Ally?

19:17.942 --> 19:19.108
Sure.

19:19.110 --> 19:20.442
If that's what we can afford.

19:20.444 --> 19:23.078
I mean, it's not like either
of us manages the meat.

19:23.080 --> 19:25.180
So neither of you brings home the bacon?

19:25.182 --> 19:28.150
No. I don't like bacon, so
he doesn't bring it home.

19:28.152 --> 19:29.852
Oh, lady, you're killing me.

19:29.854 --> 19:31.887
Babe, as long as we're
celebrating our love,

19:31.889 --> 19:33.789
I don't care where we are.

19:33.791 --> 19:36.759
I just want everyone to
know we found each other.

19:36.761 --> 19:39.405
- Mmm...
- Mmm...

19:39.430 --> 19:41.063
Okay. People are watching.

19:41.065 --> 19:43.699
Oh. That's enough.

19:46.637 --> 19:48.303
VALENCIA: Excellent.
Great. We'll keep in touch.

19:48.305 --> 19:49.872
MARTY: We will. I'm excited. Bye, guys.

19:49.874 --> 19:51.874
Okay. Bye.

19:52.677 --> 19:53.909
Okay. What are we gonna do?

19:53.911 --> 19:55.878
- Uh... ?
- We can't plan that party.

19:55.880 --> 19:57.413
That is a pass. It's a clear pass.

19:57.415 --> 19:58.647
What are you talking about?

19:58.649 --> 20:02.017
Eh, Valencia, did you not see them
and their whole dynamic?

20:02.019 --> 20:03.886
I mean, she's only marrying
him as some kind of rebound

20:03.888 --> 20:05.187
or consolation prize.

20:05.189 --> 20:07.723
All I know is she does not love Marty.

20:07.725 --> 20:09.291
First, I didn't notice that.

20:09.293 --> 20:11.660
But even if you're right,
then I hope they get married

20:11.662 --> 20:12.795
and we do their wedding,

20:12.797 --> 20:13.862
and then we do

20:13.864 --> 20:15.064
their ironic divorce parties, and then

20:15.066 --> 20:16.265
their second weddings.

20:16.267 --> 20:17.566
That's how you build a business.

20:17.568 --> 20:19.802
Oh, wha... I... I cannot
believe you right now.

20:19.804 --> 20:21.270
Really. I can't believe,
that, considering

20:21.272 --> 20:22.438
what you and I have
been through with men,

20:22.440 --> 20:24.139
specifically Josh Chan,

20:24.141 --> 20:26.608
you would let someone marry a
person that does not love them

20:26.610 --> 20:28.744
and might, oh, I don't know,
leave them at the altar?

20:28.746 --> 20:29.845
That is not on us.

20:29.847 --> 20:31.046
Not at all.

20:31.048 --> 20:32.481
All right. You know what?
I signed up to do good

20:32.483 --> 20:33.582
and to help people.

20:33.584 --> 20:35.906
And Marty needs my help now.

20:36.148 --> 20:37.381
Where are you going?

20:37.406 --> 20:38.831
I am going to warn Marty,

20:38.856 --> 20:40.756
the way that I wish
someone had warned me.

20:40.758 --> 20:42.958
Nope, nope, nope,
nope, nope, nope, nope.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.426
You move, you die.

20:44.428 --> 20:46.263
Also, everyone warned you.

20:46.951 --> 20:48.330
Okay? Please.

20:48.464 --> 20:51.294
This is my last shot to
keep this business afloat.

20:51.621 --> 20:54.989
You wanted to help me, please help me.

20:57.942 --> 20:59.775
(insects chirping)

20:59.777 --> 21:01.143
(grunting, muttering)

21:01.145 --> 21:02.911
Of course he won, he's
got God on his side.

21:02.913 --> 21:04.179
Mm-hmm. (laughs)

21:04.181 --> 21:05.714
(knocking)

21:05.716 --> 21:06.849
Is this the poker game?

21:06.851 --> 21:08.952
I wore a red hat as requested.

21:08.977 --> 21:10.452
Red hat was a code.

21:10.454 --> 21:11.882
Not a dress code?

21:11.907 --> 21:14.341
- No.
- Oops.

21:16.135 --> 21:17.803
Okay.

21:18.129 --> 21:22.531
I would like to turn this
money into more money, please.

21:22.533 --> 21:23.632
BRAH: I'll take that.

21:23.634 --> 21:25.267
- Thank you.
- TIM: Yeah.

21:25.269 --> 21:26.502
Let's do this.

21:26.504 --> 21:28.237
Mama needs some new insulin.

21:28.239 --> 21:28.971
(whoops)

21:28.973 --> 21:29.972
Actually, she really does.

21:29.974 --> 21:31.606
Her blood sugar is all over the place.

21:31.631 --> 21:33.965
Okay, belly up to the bar, boys.

21:35.012 --> 21:36.812
Oh, I'm so scared, Father.

21:36.814 --> 21:38.747
Oh, I am not Father tonight.

21:38.749 --> 21:41.747
Tonight you will call me Daddy.

21:48.872 --> 21:50.597
- Okay. You ready?
- Ooh. Okay.

21:50.622 --> 21:52.605
Day seven. Time to face the music.

21:52.630 --> 21:53.763
Yeah. I'm ready.

21:53.765 --> 21:55.331
All right.

21:56.263 --> 21:57.431
(exhales sharply)

21:57.456 --> 21:59.422
Time to measure that body fat.

22:01.114 --> 22:02.705
- Oh, my God.
- What?

22:02.707 --> 22:04.841
- This is insane.
- What do we got?

22:04.843 --> 22:07.027
You're down 1.2%.

22:07.052 --> 22:08.711
- What? Whoa! That is crazy.
- (laughs): Yeah.

22:08.713 --> 22:10.113
That's like Efron territory.

22:10.115 --> 22:11.910
That's like Baywatch Efron.

22:11.935 --> 22:14.169
Not-not High School
Musical dough-boy Efron.

22:14.171 --> 22:15.504
- No.
- (blows raspberry)

22:15.506 --> 22:17.005
- Okay. All right. My turn.
- Yeah.

22:17.007 --> 22:18.240
Here we go. (clears throat)

22:18.242 --> 22:19.341
Here we go. Yep.

22:19.343 --> 22:20.408
- Oh, I'm nervous.
- Okay.

22:20.410 --> 22:22.277
No, you got this.

22:22.279 --> 22:25.113
- Oof.
- What?

22:25.115 --> 22:27.549
- Sorry, dude.
- Damn it!

22:27.551 --> 22:29.117
I ate a banana.

22:29.119 --> 22:30.952
Why do they put bananas
in the fruit section?

22:30.954 --> 22:32.454
They should be in the candy section.

22:32.456 --> 22:33.922
I'm a candy-eating child.

22:33.924 --> 22:36.124
- Yeah, no, this is bad.
- (groans)

22:36.126 --> 22:39.327
You're only down 1.3%.

22:39.329 --> 22:40.929
- What? Really?
- (laughing): Yeah!

22:40.931 --> 22:42.163
- Yes, dude.
- You were, you were kidding just now?

22:42.165 --> 22:43.398
- I was kidding just now!
- (whoops)

22:43.400 --> 22:44.633
- Come on!
- Yeah!

22:44.635 --> 22:46.968
That means that we both
beat our personal records.

22:46.970 --> 22:47.769
Yes, we did!

22:47.771 --> 22:49.070
- (whoops)
- Yeah!

22:49.072 --> 22:50.772
You know what we should
do? We should get out there.

22:50.774 --> 22:51.973
We should go get hit on.

22:51.975 --> 22:53.575
Yeah, we should. We should.

22:53.577 --> 22:56.177
We can't keep this chiseled
perfection locked away in here.

22:56.179 --> 22:57.512
Mm-mm. No, we should
take these sculptures out

22:57.514 --> 22:58.847
on a walking tour.

22:58.849 --> 23:01.416
Better yet, let's take
these sculptures to a museum,

23:01.418 --> 23:03.118
put 'em on display.

23:04.087 --> 23:05.887
We're talking about
going to a bar, right?

23:05.889 --> 23:07.956
No, I thought we'd go
to an actual museum,

23:07.958 --> 23:09.424
maybe take an audio tour,

23:09.426 --> 23:11.092
swing by the gift shop,
buy a book, or something.

23:11.094 --> 23:12.694
- Really?
- Yeah, no, I'm talking about a bar.

23:12.696 --> 23:14.462
- Oh.
- Come on. Let's go, you sexy dum-dum.

23:14.464 --> 23:15.564
Okay.

23:16.533 --> 23:17.532
WOMAN: Eyes up!

23:17.534 --> 23:18.800
MAN: Foul ball!

23:18.802 --> 23:21.169
Ally's so cold and distant.

23:21.171 --> 23:23.038
It's like she's got
one foot out the door.

23:23.040 --> 23:24.773
And have you noticed how
Marty always texts us back,

23:24.775 --> 23:26.975
like, right away, but
Ally only texts back things

23:26.977 --> 23:28.743
like busy or K

23:28.745 --> 23:31.179
or L, which I think
is just a typo for K.

23:31.181 --> 23:32.147
So what?

23:32.149 --> 23:33.348
(grunts) Valencia.

23:33.350 --> 23:34.616
I just have a gut feeling.

23:34.618 --> 23:35.850
Stop it, please.

23:35.852 --> 23:38.019
This is all you've talked
about for the past week.

23:38.021 --> 23:39.387
Yeah, but I've only
aired my doubts to you;

23:39.389 --> 23:40.589
I haven't said anything to Marty.

23:40.591 --> 23:42.257
Because they are not real.

23:42.259 --> 23:43.558
And even if they were,

23:43.560 --> 23:44.926
- I don't care.
- (Marty laughs)

23:45.442 --> 23:46.761
Now they're here.

23:46.848 --> 23:48.691
Pull yourself together.

23:49.119 --> 23:50.485
(exhales)

23:52.869 --> 23:55.704
Well, slap me with a schnitzel.

23:55.706 --> 23:57.472
This looks amazing.

23:57.474 --> 23:59.107
- Valencia, you outdid yourself.
- (phone vibrates)

23:59.109 --> 23:59.874
Ah.

23:59.876 --> 24:03.111
- Didn't she, Ally?
- (laughs)

24:03.590 --> 24:05.914
Sorry, it's the beverage manager.

24:05.916 --> 24:08.383
He's kind of funny, but it's
like, Why are you texting me?

24:08.385 --> 24:10.318
- I'm engaged.
- (laughs)

24:10.988 --> 24:12.687
Uh... Wow.

24:12.689 --> 24:15.056
(laughs)

24:15.058 --> 24:16.925
Say nothing.

24:16.927 --> 24:18.059
(laughs)

24:18.061 --> 24:19.260
VALENCIA: Okay.

24:19.262 --> 24:21.329
(exhales)

24:23.433 --> 24:26.968
So I told WiJo I was a volunteer
fireman, but that's a lie.

24:26.970 --> 24:28.628
You're not?

24:29.006 --> 24:31.306
I'm not totally a fireman.

24:31.308 --> 24:33.341
Okay, so you're a,
you're a partial fireman?

24:33.343 --> 24:36.344
Josh... what job do you have?

24:36.346 --> 24:38.813
Wha... it's not about the
job, it's about my future.

24:39.277 --> 24:41.457
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

24:43.035 --> 24:45.186
everyone around me seems to
know what they want to be,

24:45.188 --> 24:46.348
and I don't.

24:47.591 --> 24:49.168
It makes me feel so bad.

24:49.721 --> 24:53.461
So, whenever I'm at my job,
which, again, is somewhat

24:53.463 --> 24:55.697
but not completely
like being a fireman...

24:55.699 --> 24:56.998
Uh-huh.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.237
... I feel so sorry for myself.

25:00.003 --> 25:01.836
Like, I want to cry.

25:01.838 --> 25:05.607
Okay. Well, there's nothing
wrong with crying, man.

25:05.609 --> 25:07.409
Especially for someone
in your situation,

25:07.411 --> 25:09.344
which, you know, as I understand it,

25:09.346 --> 25:12.313
is being kind of sort of
a paid volunteer fireman...

25:12.315 --> 25:13.148
Mm-hmm.

25:13.150 --> 25:15.283
... things can get really rough.

25:15.285 --> 25:16.254
Yeah.

25:17.054 --> 25:18.853
- Yeah, they are.
- Yeah.

25:19.183 --> 25:20.989
Thanks. You get it.

25:20.991 --> 25:22.891
Yeah. And, dude, whatever you're doing,

25:22.893 --> 25:24.125
you look great. (chuckles)

25:24.127 --> 25:26.261
Like, any actual fireman
would be super happy

25:26.263 --> 25:27.696
to have your body.

25:27.698 --> 25:29.397
Thanks. It's hard to look this good.

25:29.399 --> 25:30.699
Uh-huh.

25:30.701 --> 25:32.801
(dance music playing)

25:39.142 --> 25:40.241
Whoa.

25:40.243 --> 25:41.876
- Lot of dudes at this place.
- Yeah.

25:41.878 --> 25:43.078
- Some are kissing.
- That's cool.

25:43.080 --> 25:44.512
Oh, yeah, no, it's a gay bar.

25:44.514 --> 25:46.681
Which is great for me, but it's
also actually great for you,

25:46.683 --> 25:48.783
'cause bachelorette
parties, girls' nights out,

25:48.785 --> 25:51.319
girls who like to dance in a circle.

25:51.321 --> 25:52.754
I don't know. They're all here.

25:52.756 --> 25:53.722
(whooping)

25:53.724 --> 25:55.123
Oh, yeah, look at this, huh?

25:55.125 --> 25:57.892
- Cool.
- No. Not cool. It's actually horrible.

25:57.894 --> 26:00.242
Straight girls are ruining
the best part about being gay.

26:00.267 --> 26:02.067
This used to be the one
place that belonged to us,

26:02.069 --> 26:03.135
but whatever.

26:03.137 --> 26:05.771
Tonight... it works for both of us.

26:05.773 --> 26:07.039
So, uh, come on.

26:07.041 --> 26:08.607
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

26:09.777 --> 26:10.776
(Tim sighs)

26:10.778 --> 26:12.044
DARRYL: Ooh!

26:12.046 --> 26:14.313
Ante, ante, show your fanny,

26:14.315 --> 26:16.718
make that money and turn it into honey.

26:16.743 --> 26:18.509
We're not ante-ing, idiot.

26:18.534 --> 26:20.167
Dude, you won last week.

26:20.621 --> 26:22.621
- Should've just called it a day.
- BRAH: Yeah, also,

26:22.623 --> 26:24.123
if you act like that,
no one's gonna feel bad

26:24.125 --> 26:25.324
about taking your money.

26:25.326 --> 26:26.658
Oh, you're just sore, because last week,

26:26.660 --> 26:28.160
I won a K and a G,

26:28.162 --> 26:30.529
and some soon-to-be,
God willing, Tubmans.

26:30.531 --> 26:32.064
And this week I'm gonna

26:32.066 --> 26:33.249
double and triple that.

26:33.274 --> 26:34.807
Papa needs a baby.

26:34.820 --> 26:36.788
Someone is gonna knife
you in the parking lot.

26:36.804 --> 26:40.161
Okay. Aces are up, deuces are wild.

26:40.186 --> 26:42.074
Give me some money to buy my child!

26:42.076 --> 26:43.142
(laughs)

26:43.144 --> 26:44.543
(clears throat) That
did not come out right.

26:44.545 --> 26:47.116
I would never purchase a child.

26:47.141 --> 26:50.175
I think that trafficking is
society's greatest scourge.

26:51.319 --> 26:52.451
Read 'em and weep.

26:52.453 --> 26:53.452
Sevens and fives.

26:53.454 --> 26:54.820
(groans)

26:56.210 --> 26:57.556
I got a flush.

26:57.558 --> 26:59.525
ALL: Oh!

26:59.527 --> 27:02.328
- (laughter)
- Oh.

27:02.330 --> 27:04.163
Damn her and her lucky peach.

27:04.165 --> 27:05.831
DARRYL: My egg money.

27:05.942 --> 27:07.679
Oh, no.

27:10.371 --> 27:12.504
(festive German music playing)

27:18.980 --> 27:20.412
I wrote a song for you.

27:20.414 --> 27:21.847
It's called Punch

27:21.849 --> 27:23.682
the Time Card of My Heart.

27:23.684 --> 27:26.752
Awesome. I'd love to read it later.

27:26.754 --> 27:28.187
Oh, I was gonna sing it.

27:28.189 --> 27:29.555
Honey,

27:29.557 --> 27:31.041
there are people here.

27:32.751 --> 27:33.602
(Heather groans)

27:33.627 --> 27:36.462
I hate how much I'm
pulling this look off.

27:36.464 --> 27:37.663
Wait, what are you doing?

27:37.665 --> 27:39.465
You're supposed to be
passing out the wieners.

27:39.467 --> 27:40.799
(laughs) Wieners.

27:40.801 --> 27:43.068
But, so I'm the only one working?

27:43.070 --> 27:44.503
I know, I...

27:44.505 --> 27:46.739
My services are needed
elsewhere right now.

27:46.741 --> 27:48.874
Rebecca. What are you doing?

27:48.876 --> 27:50.976
Slap on a smile and
pass out those sausages.

27:50.978 --> 27:53.879
I see some frauleins
and herrs without food.

27:53.881 --> 27:55.528
Don't mess this up for me.

27:56.115 --> 27:58.090
Later, hosen.

27:58.115 --> 28:00.281
(sighs)

28:02.380 --> 28:04.423
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

28:32.130 --> 28:34.464
(ringtone plays)

28:35.956 --> 28:38.691
You're late.

28:38.693 --> 28:40.344
When are you getting here?

28:40.661 --> 28:42.961
Bring someone, so it
doesn't look suspicious.

28:43.126 --> 28:44.626
(gasps)

28:52.133 --> 28:53.699
Dude.

28:53.701 --> 28:55.328
That guy you were dancing with is hot.

28:55.352 --> 28:56.585
(laughing): Yeah! Yeah.

28:56.587 --> 28:58.921
- And your girl.
- Oh.

28:58.923 --> 29:01.123
- Smoking.
- They want to go home with us.

29:01.125 --> 29:02.591
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, they do.

29:02.616 --> 29:04.850
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah. Yep.

29:07.664 --> 29:08.730
So why don't I want to?

29:08.732 --> 29:11.466
I don't know. I don't want to, either.

29:12.531 --> 29:15.904
Do you think it's because of
our completely mutual breakups?

29:15.906 --> 29:17.239
(chuckles)

29:18.075 --> 29:19.790
Who are we kidding, dude?

29:22.019 --> 29:23.579
We got dumped.

29:24.315 --> 29:25.714
Yeah.

29:25.716 --> 29:27.516
We did.

29:28.071 --> 29:29.751
Ugh.

29:29.753 --> 29:30.953
Yeah.

29:31.095 --> 29:32.727
Onion rings?

29:32.839 --> 29:34.071
Hundo P.

29:34.191 --> 29:35.224
Hi.

29:35.226 --> 29:38.026
BRODY: Marty and Ally.

29:38.028 --> 29:39.126
At long last,

29:39.151 --> 29:42.782
your epic love story
has reached fruition.

29:44.196 --> 29:46.134
Fruit, produce?

29:46.136 --> 29:48.003
Grocery store... okay. No?

29:48.005 --> 29:49.137
Too smart? All right.

29:49.139 --> 29:53.575
To continue, um, Ally,
once you were mine,

29:53.662 --> 29:56.173
and then Marty here
came and took you away,

29:56.475 --> 29:57.456
with his...

29:57.481 --> 30:01.316
weird songs and his big hair, I guess?

30:01.318 --> 30:03.852
I mean, nobody gets it, right?

30:03.854 --> 30:06.343
But I think the important thing is that

30:06.368 --> 30:08.724
I had a very big part

30:08.726 --> 30:10.893
in your love story, and
so I kind of feel like...

30:10.895 --> 30:12.494
I don't understand.

30:12.496 --> 30:13.662
What am I telling people?

30:13.664 --> 30:15.197
Just act like you're my date.

30:15.199 --> 30:16.798
That's what I'm paying you for.

30:16.823 --> 30:18.851
BRODY: What is this venue?

30:21.077 --> 30:22.938
It's like a sad restaurant
attached to a batting cage?

30:22.940 --> 30:25.807
But they say love's
a lot like a pretzel.

30:25.809 --> 30:28.243
You know? It's twisty
and it's turny, and...

30:28.245 --> 30:30.512
once the salt's gone, it's pretty bland.

30:30.514 --> 30:32.781
So, good luck, guys. Anyways,

speaking of Oktoberfest, who
here loves Angela Merkel, huh?

30:35.753 --> 30:37.786
Chancellor? I hardly know her.

35:13.697 --> 35:15.897
(all crying)

35:28.956 --> 35:30.580
Hey, have you seen Ally?

35:31.151 --> 35:34.519
Seen? Is that supposed
to be an eye joke?

35:35.021 --> 35:36.557
No.

35:38.214 --> 35:39.847
(Ally laughs)

35:45.299 --> 35:47.732
(sighs)

35:50.830 --> 35:52.362
Ahem.

35:52.739 --> 35:54.745
(clears throat)

35:54.878 --> 35:57.178
Oh, yeah, it's classic drywall.

35:57.705 --> 35:59.480
It's flat. It's dry.

35:59.482 --> 36:01.690
Uh... it's a wall.

36:02.799 --> 36:04.886
What is wrong with you?

36:04.888 --> 36:07.722
Why are you cheating on the
person you're about to marry?

36:07.724 --> 36:10.193
God, you don't even seem to like him.

36:10.527 --> 36:12.584
He doesn't deserve this. He's a person.

36:12.896 --> 36:14.279
I just want to be married.

36:14.304 --> 36:15.833
All my friends are married.

36:15.858 --> 36:17.591
I'm not ready for commitment.

36:18.248 --> 36:20.969
Okay, that's it.
I'm putting a stop to this.

36:24.608 --> 36:25.974
Dude.

36:26.224 --> 36:28.743
Why didn't you tell me
you were working the pole?

36:28.745 --> 36:29.777
I'm not a stripper.

36:29.779 --> 36:30.979
I'm a go-go dancer.

36:30.981 --> 36:32.480
There's no pole.

36:32.482 --> 36:33.748
Actually, I wish there was.

36:33.750 --> 36:35.483
It would make the whole fireman
thing a whole lot better.

36:35.573 --> 36:37.652
Hmm. I-I was embarrassed.

36:37.654 --> 36:39.988
I-I didn't want to
ruin your opinion of me.

36:39.990 --> 36:43.391
You guys put me up on a
pedestal and think I'm perfect.

36:43.393 --> 36:45.126
No, no. No one thinks that.

36:45.128 --> 36:46.227
NATHANIEL: Hey, Josh.

36:46.229 --> 36:48.029
Josh, this is Mona.

36:48.031 --> 36:49.631
We know each other from Stanford.

36:49.633 --> 36:51.032
Isn't that an amazing coincidence?

36:51.034 --> 36:52.700
She's here with her old sorority sisters

36:52.702 --> 36:54.369
doing a little scavenger hunt.

36:54.371 --> 36:56.388
Seriously, they should just
burn all these places down.

36:56.413 --> 36:57.579
Hi, Joshes.

36:57.604 --> 36:59.003
Nat, I'm gonna go say
bye to my friends, okay?

36:59.028 --> 37:00.361
Okay.

37:03.273 --> 37:06.108
You, uh, you going home with her?

37:06.485 --> 37:08.616
Yeah. I figured why not?

37:08.618 --> 37:09.918
You know?

37:09.920 --> 37:11.753
I already gave her my boxers
for the scavenger hunt,

37:11.755 --> 37:12.787
so I'm halfway there.

37:12.789 --> 37:14.155
Yeah.

37:14.157 --> 37:15.423
You going home?

37:15.425 --> 37:17.626
Uh... yeah.

37:17.651 --> 37:18.860
Yeah, I'm good.

37:18.862 --> 37:20.128
You sure? You don't want

37:20.130 --> 37:21.462
to go back inside and find someone, too?

37:21.464 --> 37:22.563
Oh, yeah, totally.

37:22.565 --> 37:23.965
This place doesn't just have hot girls.

37:23.967 --> 37:26.457
It also has tons of gay guys.

37:27.939 --> 37:29.839
Huh?

37:35.949 --> 37:37.545
VALENCIA: Now let's hear

37:37.547 --> 37:38.980
from Marty's grandmother.

37:38.982 --> 37:40.915
Aw. Yay.

37:43.292 --> 37:44.658
All right, give me that, Grandma.

37:44.683 --> 37:47.322
- (guests booing)
- MAN: Hey, come on.

37:47.324 --> 37:48.756
But that's my grandma.

37:48.758 --> 37:51.059
Oh, you know what, you should thank me.

37:51.061 --> 37:52.126
She was gonna rap.

37:52.128 --> 37:53.298
Oh, no.

37:53.323 --> 37:54.689
Ally.

37:54.714 --> 37:56.280
This toast is from me.

37:56.305 --> 37:58.305
Sit your ass down, bitch.

37:58.330 --> 37:59.863
(guests murmuring)

37:59.888 --> 38:01.775
(chuckles nervously)

38:13.134 --> 38:14.667
What's wrong?

38:15.970 --> 38:18.017
I'm here today...

38:20.446 --> 38:22.642
... to talk about love.

38:23.450 --> 38:25.684
Love, uh...

38:26.999 --> 38:28.758
can be an amazing thing.

38:29.124 --> 38:31.651
And when you're in it,

38:32.022 --> 38:34.320
it's the most wonderful
feeling in the world.

38:34.322 --> 38:36.789
(clears throat) I've been
doing a lot of thinking

38:36.791 --> 38:38.368
about love in general lately.

38:38.530 --> 38:39.893
Uh...

38:40.266 --> 38:42.161
And, ah, screw it.

38:42.163 --> 38:43.329
I tried, Valencia. I'm sorry.

38:43.331 --> 38:45.331
Okay, Marty, Ally's cheating on you.

38:45.333 --> 38:46.432
She's cheating on you with that guy

38:46.434 --> 38:48.668
over there, and it's very obvious,

38:48.670 --> 38:50.637
so it's a little on
you for not noticing,

38:50.639 --> 38:52.238
but, Marty, I can't
have this happen to you

38:52.240 --> 38:54.007
'cause it happened to
me and no one warned me.

38:54.009 --> 38:55.208
Um, everyone warned her.

38:55.210 --> 38:56.309
Like, everyone.

38:56.311 --> 38:58.011
Okay, just... Marty,
I know this is a shock,

38:58.013 --> 39:00.993
and you love her, and
that feels wonderful,

39:01.018 --> 39:03.750
and we tell ourselves that that
feeling is some higher calling,

39:03.752 --> 39:06.419
but the truth is,
Marty, love can hurt you

39:06.634 --> 39:08.688
and it can be very, very dangerous.

39:09.649 --> 39:12.438
My obsession with love
almost cost me my life.

39:12.961 --> 39:15.204
So, I know this... I know it hurts.

39:15.229 --> 39:17.229
But, Marty, I just freed you.

39:17.662 --> 39:19.299
You're free.

39:19.301 --> 39:21.506
The rest of your life begins now.

39:21.703 --> 39:24.037
Rebecca, I already knew about BevBro.

39:24.319 --> 39:27.173
I-I've written 12 songs about it.

39:27.175 --> 39:29.809
They include Two-Liter Two-Timer,

39:29.811 --> 39:33.131
Six Pack of Pain, and
A Carbonated Crime.

39:33.179 --> 39:34.979
I don't care.

39:35.004 --> 39:36.537
I love her.

39:37.217 --> 39:38.895
I'll take what I can get.

39:40.325 --> 39:42.231
She makes me happy...

39:43.887 --> 39:45.636
and that's all that matters.

39:46.756 --> 39:48.872
And it's none of your business.

39:58.478 --> 39:59.981
It's okay.

40:09.145 --> 40:10.383
Oh, hey, Darryl.

40:10.511 --> 40:11.877
Oh, hey, Rebecca.

40:11.902 --> 40:13.856
You're eating a plain cake donut?

40:13.881 --> 40:15.788
- Oh.
- What's wrong?

40:15.790 --> 40:17.023
I don't deserve sprinkles.

40:17.025 --> 40:19.392
- What?
- I gambled all my money away.

40:19.394 --> 40:21.094
- Oh.
- (groans)

40:21.317 --> 40:23.296
You know why they call
it beginner's luck?

40:23.298 --> 40:25.957
Because it doesn't work
the second time you try it.

40:27.613 --> 40:28.768
What's up with you?

40:28.770 --> 40:29.936
You don't look so hot yourself.

40:29.938 --> 40:31.504
(sighing): It's the usual.

40:31.506 --> 40:33.324
I'm just, I'm broken and terrible.

40:34.409 --> 40:37.010
It turns out I'm not only
good at ruining my own life,

40:37.012 --> 40:40.279
I'm really good at... ruining
other people's lives.

40:40.281 --> 40:41.581
Oh.

40:41.583 --> 40:42.749
I tried to help Valencia

40:42.751 --> 40:44.929
with her new business and I just...

40:45.280 --> 40:46.919
I royally screwed up.

40:46.921 --> 40:48.154
And she said she forgives me,

40:48.156 --> 40:49.444
but...

40:50.812 --> 40:53.926
she's had to forgive me so
many times at this point.

40:55.856 --> 40:57.230
I really am the worst.

40:57.232 --> 40:59.265
What? No, you're not.
You're no such thing.

40:59.267 --> 41:00.800
You're actually one
of my favorite people.

41:00.981 --> 41:02.969
- Thank you.
- Top five.

41:02.971 --> 41:04.645
Oh, Darryl.

41:05.540 --> 41:07.387
You always make me feel better.

41:08.929 --> 41:11.730
The first second I came here,
you've been so nice to me.

41:12.603 --> 41:13.768
I'd do anything for you.

41:13.793 --> 41:14.959
You know that, right?

41:17.223 --> 41:18.751
Hey...

41:18.753 --> 41:20.053
PAULA: Wow, really?

41:20.055 --> 41:22.555
You're donating an egg to Darryl?

41:22.557 --> 41:25.324
That's... huge.

41:25.326 --> 41:26.379
Is it, though?

41:26.594 --> 41:28.061
They're just gonna pop
out one of my eggies,

41:28.063 --> 41:29.362
put it in someone else's oven,

41:29.364 --> 41:30.797
someone else will raise it.

41:30.799 --> 41:32.866
It's a lot easier than
teaching a poor person to read.

41:32.891 --> 41:34.300
I mean, I don't mean poor. Sorry.

41:34.302 --> 41:36.369
- I mean dumb.
- Right.

41:36.371 --> 41:38.071
Rebecca, I-I know you
want to help Darryl,

41:38.073 --> 41:39.539
but how is this gonna
affect your therapy?

41:39.541 --> 41:41.774
Have you talked to
Dr. Shin or your group?

41:41.776 --> 41:43.543
And is now the time to
be shooting up hormones?

41:43.545 --> 41:45.745
I mean, your regular period is
like the Northridge earthquake.

41:46.383 --> 41:49.816
Lots of screaming and
crying and broken dishes.

41:49.818 --> 41:52.151
Paula, I hear your
questions and concerns,

41:52.454 --> 41:55.288
but I promise you, I
have thought this through.

41:55.290 --> 41:56.255
Have you, though?

41:56.257 --> 41:57.457
No, not at all.
