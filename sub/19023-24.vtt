<i>Since I was a kid, I've been able
to sleep through anything.</i>

00:06.882 --> 00:08.926
<i>Storms, sirens, you name it.</i>

00:09.009 --> 00:11.178
<i>Last night I didn't sleep.</i>

00:12.721 --> 00:15.599
<i>Couldn't stop thinking
about this past year.</i>

00:17.851 --> 00:20.521
Oh, please.
l've seen you naked before.

00:21.647 --> 00:25.692
Dude, you had that?
Five up high for cherry pie!

00:27.110 --> 00:29.780
You find it funny, Dr Dorian?
Why don't you tell me

00:29.863 --> 00:33.450
the EKG findings of Wolff-
Parkinson-White Syndrome?

00:33.534 --> 00:35.285
l haven't even showered yet.

00:35.369 --> 00:38.455
We could shower together
for old time's sake.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.750
l never would've slept with you
if l knew you were Dr Cox's ex.

00:41.834 --> 00:43.502
What was that, newbie?

00:44.878 --> 00:48.215
Relax. He doesn't know.

00:48.298 --> 00:50.384
He likes Carla anyway.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.803
l got Carla wrapped
around my finger.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.304
l heard that!

00:54.388 --> 00:56.932
- What are you guys talking about?
- Nothing.

00:57.015 --> 00:59.893
- Thank you.
- Forget about it.

00:59.977 --> 01:04.147
No, no, no.
You can't forget about these.

01:04.230 --> 01:07.776
l'd pull those hands back
if you wanna keep 'em, Q-tip.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.778
That's just the kind of thing

01:09.862 --> 01:13.031
that can be construed
as sexual harassment.

01:13.115 --> 01:16.827
Got a few hairs
in the sink, there, huh?

01:16.910 --> 01:20.747
For God's sake, man,
don't comb so hard.

01:20.831 --> 01:23.250
All right, enough is enough!

01:30.924 --> 01:34.428
l guess l don't fit in
with your mirror friends.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.346
Enjoy.

01:41.059 --> 01:43.854
<i>I don't know why my mind
is all over the place.</i>

01:43.937 --> 01:47.482
<i>Maybe it's because today
isn't just any other day.</i>

01:47.566 --> 01:50.402
<i>It's my last day as an intern.</i>

01:50.485 --> 01:52.738
Oh, you got me!

01:52.821 --> 01:54.823
Let me go, let me go!

01:54.907 --> 01:56.533
Hey, amigos!

01:56.617 --> 01:58.619
Can you guys believe this?

01:58.702 --> 02:00.954
Tomorrow,
we are officially residents.

02:01.038 --> 02:03.165
Let's get our last day on.

02:03.248 --> 02:06.418
<i>What the hell?
He deserves it too.</i>

02:08.711 --> 02:09.755
Mother...

02:23.810 --> 02:27.022
Mr Bober has been complaining
of abdominal pain and nausea.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.691
- Looks like cholecystitis.
- What, newbie?

02:29.775 --> 02:32.986
This gentleman is suffering
from an inflamed gallbladder

02:33.070 --> 02:35.989
and you have him eating
a grilled cheese sandwich.

02:36.073 --> 02:38.825
Here's an idea.
Why don't we just have him

02:38.909 --> 02:42.704
wash the whole thing down
with a big ol' mug of vodka?

02:43.372 --> 02:46.250
Mr Bober back there is
one of our frequent flyers.

02:46.333 --> 02:49.837
He's with us every six months
for years and l've grown fond of him.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.464
So if you could somehow
manage to not kill him,

02:52.548 --> 02:55.133
well, then, oh, gee,
that would just be ducky.

02:55.217 --> 02:58.428
How come you haven't mentioned
it's my last day as an intern?

02:58.512 --> 03:00.472
Haven't l?

03:00.556 --> 03:03.559
- Come here. Oh!
- OK. OK.

03:04.434 --> 03:07.563
Despite the fact that tomorrow
you will be a resident,

03:07.646 --> 03:10.399
you'll still be the excitable girl
that you are now.

03:10.482 --> 03:13.026
The only difference will be
that some new intern

03:13.110 --> 03:16.697
will mistake you for somebody
who actually knows something.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.365
<i>Why is he so uptight today?</i>

03:18.448 --> 03:20.701
<i>- Hey, Perry.
- Oh, OK.</i>

03:20.784 --> 03:23.662
Jordan. To what
do we owe the horror?

03:23.745 --> 03:25.205
Come on, Perry.

03:25.289 --> 03:28.167
No soft spot for the one woman
who slept with you sober?

03:28.250 --> 03:30.961
Now, if you could sign
this insurance physical,

03:31.044 --> 03:34.506
l'll go back to trying to forget
that horrible, horrible night.

03:34.590 --> 03:37.426
For me to sign this, l would
have to give you a physical.

03:37.509 --> 03:38.969
And when l say ''l,''

03:39.052 --> 03:42.764
l, of course, mean
absolutely anybody but me.

03:42.848 --> 03:46.101
Barbie!
Give my ex-wife here a physical,

03:46.185 --> 03:49.521
and don't be afraid
of that third eye on her chest.

03:49.605 --> 03:54.109
Just remember, it's just as scared
of you as you are of it.

03:57.613 --> 03:59.489
Let's get physical?

04:01.450 --> 04:04.828
- Doesn't matter...
- Carla, can you do me a favour?

04:04.912 --> 04:08.207
Mr Bober needs yet another
Foley catheter. l am so swamped.

04:08.290 --> 04:11.043
Sure, no problem.
But we're not finished yet!

04:11.126 --> 04:12.711
l know we're not finished yet.

04:12.794 --> 04:16.464
l didn't say we were finished yet.
But, baby, it's up to you.

04:16.548 --> 04:18.132
<i>When a couple argues,</i>

04:18.216 --> 04:20.385
<i>you should run
before you get roped in.</i>

04:20.469 --> 04:21.845
Hey, JD.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.600
- You got him, baby.
- l got him.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.936
- l got him!
- Bring him in.

04:29.019 --> 04:32.648
We were talking about our relationship
and how great everything is.

04:32.731 --> 04:35.609
l said, ''lt's weird to think
l'll never date again.''

04:35.692 --> 04:38.111
That's close,
but not quite what you said.

04:38.195 --> 04:41.823
What you said was, ''lt's weird
to think l'll never get to date again.''

04:41.907 --> 04:45.285
You see that? ''Get to date again'',
like she's missing out.

04:45.369 --> 04:48.038
- How messed up is that?
- l did not say ''get''.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.791
You're being ridiculous.
What do you think, JD?

04:50.874 --> 04:54.002
<i>Careful, Tiger. Careful.</i>

04:54.086 --> 04:56.421
l wish people
would call me Tiger.

04:56.505 --> 04:57.756
What?

04:57.840 --> 05:00.050
l agree with Laverne.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.602
Damn kids and their stupid problems.

05:10.686 --> 05:15.482
<i>l just wanna get home to a warm bath,
catch a little bit of that Fear Factor.</i>

05:18.485 --> 05:22.865
Ted, the reason we're not admiring
the new parking structure

05:22.948 --> 05:27.619
is because you failed to get legal
clearance from the zoning board.

05:29.162 --> 05:34.168
Honestly, sometimes l wonder
if you're happy here.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.259
Do it, Ted. Just do it.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.386
Bob! When l heard
you were up on the roof

05:44.469 --> 05:47.222
l just assumed it was
because your evil mission

05:47.306 --> 05:50.601
here on planet Earth had finally
come to an end, so tell me this.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.811
Where exactly is the mother ship?

05:52.895 --> 05:55.063
- Look, Ted. lt's Dr Cox.
- Hey.

05:55.147 --> 05:58.817
l just saw the new shift schedule.
Give me a break, will you?

05:58.901 --> 06:02.362
l'm glad you're here. The hospital
needs a new Residency Director

06:02.446 --> 06:04.531
and l've decided to recommend you.

06:04.615 --> 06:07.117
Now, finish your tantrum
on your own,

06:07.201 --> 06:11.330
because l'm going to go down to
the cafeteria and get myself a fro-yo.

06:11.413 --> 06:13.874
Ted, chop-chop.

06:15.083 --> 06:17.461
Save my spot.

06:17.544 --> 06:21.006
Bambi, Mr Bober's hypotensive.
l think he's becoming septic.

06:21.089 --> 06:24.343
This guy is more work than
all my other patients combined.

06:24.426 --> 06:28.680
Maybe if you tell him how hard it is
on you, he'll get better!

06:28.764 --> 06:30.682
l'll get paper towels.

06:30.766 --> 06:33.268
Don't worry.
Somebody else will get it.

06:33.352 --> 06:35.103
Yeah. Who can we get?

06:35.187 --> 06:37.689
l'm not shocked.
That's how you live your life.

06:37.773 --> 06:40.359
Got a problem?
Hey, just pass it on down the line.

06:40.442 --> 06:41.860
<i>I was gonna say something,</i>

06:41.944 --> 06:44.780
<i>but it turns out
he gave me a pretty good idea.</i>

06:46.073 --> 06:48.450
Thank you so much
for taking Bober from me.

06:48.534 --> 06:52.162
- But, JD, l...
- l owe you.

06:52.246 --> 06:55.457
<i>I'm a little doormat,
I sit and stay</i>

06:55.541 --> 06:58.752
<i>Let people use me
every single day</i>

06:58.836 --> 07:00.295
Excuse me?

07:00.379 --> 07:04.633
Oh, it's a song l'm working on.
l made it up.

07:04.716 --> 07:07.803
So l let myself get taken
advantage of sometimes, you know?

07:07.886 --> 07:10.472
l mean, big deal.
How do you make friends?

07:10.556 --> 07:12.224
l've seen your type before.

07:12.307 --> 07:15.602
You're that girl that thought
she wanted to lose her virginity

07:15.686 --> 07:18.355
at a party while another guy
was asleep in the room.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.524
Chaz really cared for me.

07:20.607 --> 07:23.527
And l'm sure you have
a cool T-shirt to prove it.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.571
Can we please finish this physical?

07:25.654 --> 07:28.949
And l can't pee right now,
so you'll have to go for me.

07:32.411 --> 07:34.872
What a good girl. Good girl.

07:34.955 --> 07:39.084
<i>Still, Elliot wasn't gonna let herself
get stuck with Mr Bober, either.</i>

07:39.168 --> 07:42.087
- How you doing, Mr Bober?
- Fine.

07:42.171 --> 07:44.840
OK, why did you let
Elliot turf him up here?

07:44.923 --> 07:46.133
l don't know.

07:46.216 --> 07:50.095
All l really remember is she dropped
her pen and bent over.

07:50.179 --> 07:52.973
Dude, thong city!

07:53.056 --> 07:55.642
No. No high-five for you.

07:55.726 --> 07:58.854
- Todd did bad?
- Todd did very bad.

07:58.937 --> 08:00.898
Todd did very, very bad.

08:01.440 --> 08:02.900
What the hell, Elliot?

08:02.983 --> 08:05.360
You can't just pawn
this Bober guy off on me.

08:05.444 --> 08:08.906
lt was JD's patient! l was just
the middleman. Woman. Person.

08:08.989 --> 08:11.742
We can stand here
and argue about who screwed who.

08:11.825 --> 08:12.910
Or?

08:12.993 --> 08:14.953
Or nothing.
l'm on break. Let's do it.

08:15.037 --> 08:18.582
- Rock-paper-scissors right now.
- Fine. Loser gets Bober.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.834
Once, twice, three, shoot!

08:20.918 --> 08:22.711
Did you say Bober?

08:22.794 --> 08:25.506
l'm looking for my grandfather,
Frank Bober.

08:25.589 --> 08:29.676
We moved him to the lCU, dear.
He'll show you up.

08:31.136 --> 08:33.304
That's OK. She...
She didn't hear us.

08:33.388 --> 08:36.475
No, but Jesus did.

08:36.558 --> 08:42.272
<i>Just a closer walk with thee</i>

08:44.149 --> 08:46.735
l didn't appreciate
your game this morning.

08:46.818 --> 08:50.572
Heavens to Betsy,
the gazpacho is scrumptious today.

08:50.656 --> 08:53.200
Dangling that fake promotion
in front of me.

08:53.283 --> 08:56.745
l was dead serious about the
Residency Director's position.

08:56.828 --> 09:00.999
Well, what makes you think
that l'd be interested in that?

09:01.083 --> 09:02.459
Because you want my job,

09:02.543 --> 09:05.254
and you'll never get it
without this on your résumé.

09:05.337 --> 09:07.339
But you hate me.

09:07.422 --> 09:12.052
- Like nuts in brownies, captain.
- l don't get your angle.

09:12.135 --> 09:14.847
What could you want
in exchange for my support,

09:14.930 --> 09:18.600
because l'm telling you,
l am not dating that daughter of yours.

09:18.684 --> 09:20.894
l only have a son.

09:20.978 --> 09:24.606
That's my bad. l was just going
by that picture on your desk.

09:24.690 --> 09:27.150
You know the financial burdens
l deal with.

09:27.234 --> 09:30.696
l want you to stop busting my chops
all the time and get on my team.

09:30.779 --> 09:36.034
- Forget about it.
- Fine. Walk away.

09:39.496 --> 09:42.124
Scrumptious.

09:42.207 --> 09:44.626
Wanna bite?

09:44.710 --> 09:47.588
We're doctors.
That's how doctors talk to doctors.

09:47.671 --> 09:51.008
Our only mistake was not being careful
about where we were.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.759
We agree we did nothing wrong,

09:52.843 --> 09:55.387
so let's check in on him
and forget about it.

09:55.470 --> 09:57.890
<i>And that's when
the three of us realized,</i>

09:57.973 --> 10:00.934
<i>even though we'd all
spent time with Mr Bober,</i>

10:01.018 --> 10:04.062
<i>none of us had any idea
what he looked like.</i>

10:04.146 --> 10:06.148
Over here.

10:07.900 --> 10:10.235
Hey, guys.

10:15.365 --> 10:17.284
<i>When we started here a year ago</i>

10:17.367 --> 10:20.370
<i>and saw some of the
insensitive and jaded doctors,</i>

10:20.454 --> 10:22.331
<i>we all said the same thing:</i>

10:22.414 --> 10:24.500
<i>''That's not gonna be me. ''</i>

10:24.583 --> 10:26.335
<i>Really, the only solace</i>

10:26.418 --> 10:29.588
<i>is that the guilt
passes pretty quickly.</i>

10:46.605 --> 10:48.649
What's wrong, dog?

10:48.732 --> 10:50.984
You guys,
we have to do something.

10:51.068 --> 10:55.405
lf we remove Mr Bober's gallbladder,
it should relieve the abdominal pain.

10:55.489 --> 10:57.699
lsn't he a little old
for that procedure?

10:57.783 --> 11:01.828
- Well, he seems stable enough.
- Problem is, he has no insurance.

11:03.789 --> 11:07.876
<i>And then, all at once,
we realized we had to do something.</i>

11:10.587 --> 11:13.715
<i>We decided to attack
the problem on three fronts.</i>

11:14.633 --> 11:15.843
Dr Cox?

11:20.222 --> 11:22.391
Ms Sullivan?

11:27.145 --> 11:29.439
Dr Wen?

11:29.523 --> 11:32.568
l thought if you looked
at Mr Bober's chart and agreed,

11:32.651 --> 11:35.320
you might be able
to pull some strings or...

11:35.404 --> 11:38.282
<i>And now, here it comes:
The calling me a girl's name,</i>

11:38.365 --> 11:40.617
<i>the telling me
not to waste my time...</i>

11:40.701 --> 11:44.163
Yep. l'll be more than glad
to help you there, Charlotte.

11:44.246 --> 11:45.998
<i>I was half right.</i>

11:46.081 --> 11:47.916
Well, thank you.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.211
Don't ever be afraid
to come to me with stuff like that.

11:51.295 --> 11:53.839
The simple fact
that you seem to give a crap

11:53.922 --> 11:56.842
is the reason l took an interest
in you to begin with.

11:56.925 --> 11:59.887
lt's why l trust you as a doctor.
Hell, it's...

12:01.138 --> 12:03.932
lt's why l trust you as a person.

12:06.935 --> 12:09.229
Are you dying?

12:09.313 --> 12:11.440
l've got a new shrink.

12:14.151 --> 12:16.069
<i>Ah, just say it.</i>

12:16.153 --> 12:18.947
You know, l want to thank you
for this whole year.

12:19.031 --> 12:20.699
Oh, no.

12:20.782 --> 12:24.328
And l just want to know
if l can buy you dinner.

12:24.411 --> 12:25.746
That'd be terrific.

12:25.829 --> 12:28.957
- Great! l'm off in a half hour...
- Oh, no!

12:29.041 --> 12:31.877
Here l was led
to believe that you were...

12:31.960 --> 12:34.379
...doing a gift certificate
kind of thing.

12:34.463 --> 12:37.966
But to sit and eat with you? That's...

12:38.050 --> 12:41.261
That's just... That's crazy talk.

12:41.345 --> 12:44.306
l have half a mind
to issue you a drug test.

12:44.389 --> 12:48.519
- Come on! What'd l sign up for...
- Would've been nice.

12:48.602 --> 12:52.856
He doesn't have insurance. lf you could
talk to the board, JD thought maybe...

12:52.940 --> 12:55.442
First he dumps that patient on you,

12:55.526 --> 12:57.611
and now he wants you
to ask me a favour?

12:57.694 --> 12:59.530
lf you don't start saying no,

12:59.613 --> 13:01.782
you're gonna wind up
on the playing a game

13:01.865 --> 13:04.910
- l call Hide The Pickle.
- JD and l are just colleagues.

13:04.993 --> 13:08.163
l was joking, but you actually
slept with him, didn't you?

13:09.498 --> 13:10.541
A little.

13:10.624 --> 13:14.670
l don't know where your mother was when
she should've told you these things,

13:14.753 --> 13:17.631
but you cannot have sex
with someone you care about.

13:17.714 --> 13:20.509
Sex is for making babies and revenge.

13:20.592 --> 13:22.386
Oh, you're so full of it.

13:24.763 --> 13:27.599
Listen, stick,
if you wanna wipe your nose

13:27.683 --> 13:30.477
and pretend that was a sneeze,
l will play along.

13:30.561 --> 13:33.772
But if you have something to say,
say it.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.985
Everybody knows
you're sleeping with Dr Cox,

13:38.068 --> 13:41.572
and it can't be about making babies,
cos you'd end up eating them.

13:41.655 --> 13:44.283
As for revenge, l'm not sure
that pleasuring him

13:44.366 --> 13:47.578
<i>while he watches SportsCenter
hurts him as much as you think.</i>

13:47.661 --> 13:50.372
You still care about him
whether you admit it or not.

13:50.455 --> 13:54.710
And if you lay one finger on me,
l'm blowing my rape whistle.

14:01.466 --> 14:03.468
Kiss her?

14:07.222 --> 14:09.600
So you see, Dr Wen,
it's not really a favour.

14:09.683 --> 14:14.271
We were supposed to do surgery
on Mrs Beckerman, but she passed away.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.190
Go on.

14:16.273 --> 14:20.152
She's dead, and we hoped that you
could keep her name on the roster.

14:20.235 --> 14:22.112
We don't wanna do surgery on her.

14:22.196 --> 14:25.449
Let's face it, Dr Wen.
We're good, but we're not that good.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.285
- You know what l'm saying?
- No.

14:28.368 --> 14:31.038
We want to get a patient
approved for surgery.

14:31.121 --> 14:33.081
We hope you can keep the slot open.

14:33.165 --> 14:34.374
Oh, sure.

14:34.458 --> 14:36.919
Dr Turk, next time
you need to talk to me,

14:37.002 --> 14:40.172
think hard about what you want to say,
then send her.

14:40.255 --> 14:44.009
- Of course. Thanks, Dr Wen.
- See, what happened there was,

14:44.092 --> 14:48.263
l knew what you were trying to say
despite the exact words you were using.

14:48.347 --> 14:51.808
l tried to help you out instead
of getting mad at you over nothing.

14:51.892 --> 14:54.603
Baby, we both know
it's not the same.

14:54.686 --> 14:57.814
You are the dumbest man
l ever laid eyes on.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.402
Still.

15:04.530 --> 15:06.990
Didn't hurt! Didn't hurt!

15:07.574 --> 15:09.660
Tell me if it hurts this time!

15:09.743 --> 15:13.997
So, you want me to approve
surgery on a 76-year-old man

15:14.081 --> 15:17.000
with no insurance
and no life-threatening condition?

15:17.084 --> 15:19.086
Young man, l'm curious.

15:19.169 --> 15:23.006
What did you think the end result
of this conversation would be?

15:23.090 --> 15:24.633
Well, pretty much, this.

15:24.716 --> 15:27.678
Except l'm invested,
so l thought l might try crying.

15:27.761 --> 15:29.513
Sport, if crying worked on me,

15:29.596 --> 15:32.349
my wife would have
her own car by now.

15:36.436 --> 15:41.984
- Bob? l think you should reconsider.
- What's that, Perry?

15:42.067 --> 15:46.071
l mean, because that didn't sound
like something a teammate would say.

15:46.154 --> 15:50.075
Maybe you meant to pat me on
the ass and say, ''Go get 'em, Bob.''

15:50.158 --> 15:52.911
Right, but what if
we were to look at this

15:52.995 --> 15:55.914
from a purely fiscal perspective?

15:55.998 --> 15:58.041
<i>Did he just say ''fiscal''?</i>

15:58.125 --> 16:01.253
After all, Mr Bober
is here every four to six months,

16:01.336 --> 16:03.547
and if we were
to consider his surgery

16:03.630 --> 16:05.674
as a one-time expenditure, then...

16:06.758 --> 16:09.887
...you would be making
the right financial call.

16:09.970 --> 16:15.225
See now? That's the kind of thinking
l can get behind!

16:15.309 --> 16:17.269
How'd that make you feel?

16:17.352 --> 16:20.564
- Dirty all over.
- You get used to it.

16:20.647 --> 16:23.692
Boys, l'll do what l can,
but if you're gonna pull this off,

16:23.775 --> 16:26.236
you're gonna need
a board member behind you.

16:26.320 --> 16:29.239
<i>How the hell
are we supposed to get that?</i>

16:29.323 --> 16:32.034
This is the closest l've come

16:32.117 --> 16:35.120
to not hating myself
after sleeping with you.

16:35.204 --> 16:37.164
Oh, you're just saying that.

16:37.247 --> 16:41.585
Actually, l'm not. l...
We connected.

16:43.253 --> 16:46.840
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

16:46.924 --> 16:50.344
l guess l was just thinking
of a guy l kind of like.

16:51.011 --> 16:52.513
Let me guess.

16:52.596 --> 16:58.769
He is an arrogant, self-hating
narcissist who just needs to be loved.

16:58.852 --> 17:02.689
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Nobody better.

17:04.233 --> 17:06.193
Hey, stud?

17:06.276 --> 17:09.154
Thank you for not asking me
to help on the Bober thing.

17:09.238 --> 17:11.949
l would've,
but it would've been pointless.

17:12.031 --> 17:15.117
Turns out, you're a very
predictable woman there.

17:15.202 --> 17:18.121
- Please.
- l know you.

17:18.204 --> 17:22.166
You're gonna walk into that boardroom
tonight all tall and strong,

17:22.251 --> 17:27.339
and then you're gonna sit back and just
pray that nobody asks your opinion.

17:27.422 --> 17:29.508
l mean, l'm sure
you probably think

17:29.591 --> 17:32.678
that your little visits here
are a spontaneous surprise,

17:32.761 --> 17:35.806
but did you ever wonder
why the only two candles l own

17:35.889 --> 17:38.100
are already lit
when you walk in that door?

17:38.183 --> 17:41.270
l mean, doll, l hate to tell you this,
but l don't walk around

17:41.353 --> 17:44.064
all day with cologne
down in my engine room.

17:44.147 --> 17:46.942
l'm not that guy.

17:47.025 --> 17:49.319
Some people like reliability.

17:49.403 --> 17:52.698
ln a sedan, it turns out it's terrific.

17:52.781 --> 17:57.077
Cheers.
Here's the good news, however.

17:58.495 --> 18:02.249
Turns out it's never too late
to turn the whole thing around.

18:02.332 --> 18:04.042
Really?

18:04.126 --> 18:07.004
All you gotta do
is stir it up a little bit.

18:07.087 --> 18:09.715
- Stir it up?
- Stir it right the hell up.

18:09.798 --> 18:14.011
- l'll try to remember that.
- So l'm guessing

18:14.094 --> 18:17.556
l'll be seeing you
in about 1 1 days, right?

18:19.224 --> 18:21.476
Probably at the exact same time.

18:23.228 --> 18:26.106
Don't forget to stir it up, baby.

18:29.985 --> 18:32.446
<i>And so it comes down to this,</i>

18:32.529 --> 18:36.366
<i>the hospital board meeting
to decide Mr Bober's fate.</i>

18:36.450 --> 18:38.577
<i>And in a weird way, ours too.</i>

19:08.899 --> 19:10.651
<i>As cheesy as it sounds,</i>

19:10.734 --> 19:13.195
<i>I think we knew
we were all gonna be OK.</i>

19:13.278 --> 19:15.739
Hi, Mr Bober.

19:15.822 --> 19:19.243
<i>Still, I've had this feeling
that I'm forgetting something.</i>

19:19.326 --> 19:20.786
Hey!

19:20.869 --> 19:23.247
Congratulations
on becoming a resident.

19:23.330 --> 19:24.790
Glad l could help.

19:24.873 --> 19:28.460
Help? You were awful to me.

19:28.544 --> 19:30.587
You... awful.

19:30.671 --> 19:33.841
Anyway, go get 'em, tiger.

19:35.008 --> 19:39.888
The world is your oyster, my friend.
What?

19:39.972 --> 19:43.392
lt's my first day.
l'm waiting for someone.

19:43.475 --> 19:45.394
This door is broke.

19:45.477 --> 19:47.938
Every fifth time or so,
it don't open.

19:48.021 --> 19:50.482
Maybe there's a paper clip
stuck in there.

19:53.151 --> 19:56.905
- Why a paper clip?
- l was just making small talk.

19:56.989 --> 20:00.659
- Did you put a paper clip in there?
- No.

20:00.742 --> 20:03.912
lf l find a paper clip...

20:03.996 --> 20:06.665
...you're goin' down.

20:06.748 --> 20:10.043
- Here's to the new residents!
- Here, here!

20:10.127 --> 20:12.546
<i>- l'm a doctor!
- It's been a long year,</i>

20:12.629 --> 20:15.591
<i>but the important thing is,
we got through it together.</i>

20:15.674 --> 20:18.719
<i>- We were a family.
- Hey, everyone.</i>

20:18.802 --> 20:21.138
- Oh, hi.
- How are you?

20:21.221 --> 20:24.266
Ms Sullivan, thank you
for helping us with Mr Bober.

20:24.349 --> 20:28.061
Don't mention it. Even though
l wasn't invited to your party,

20:28.145 --> 20:31.440
- l brought presents for everyone.
- Brace yourself, newbie.

20:31.523 --> 20:34.318
Carla, my ex-husband
is in love with you.

20:34.401 --> 20:37.487
lt's true.
Ask your boyfriend. He knows.

20:37.571 --> 20:39.615
He and Perry
talk about it all the time.

20:39.698 --> 20:42.409
l don't know why you haven't
mentioned this to her.

20:42.493 --> 20:45.370
Perhaps you're afraid
of something. Huh.

20:45.454 --> 20:48.582
And, Bob, when are you gonna
tell Perry that that promotion

20:48.665 --> 20:53.212
you're making him jump through
hoops for was filled months ago?

20:53.295 --> 20:56.840
lt just seems wrong.
Which brings us to Twinkie.

20:56.924 --> 21:00.552
lf you don't have the courage
to tell your ''colleague'' Dr Dorian

21:00.636 --> 21:02.721
that you're still crazy about him,

21:02.804 --> 21:06.475
l'm gonna do it for you,
cos that's what friends do. Yeah.

21:06.558 --> 21:09.853
And finally, Perry,

21:09.937 --> 21:12.147
you are not gonna
believe what happened

21:12.231 --> 21:14.983
the first time l met
your little protégé here.

21:15.067 --> 21:17.694
<i>Oh, please, God, no.</i>

21:17.778 --> 21:22.074
l slept with him,
and it was good.

21:22.157 --> 21:24.827
How's that for stirring things up?

21:24.910 --> 21:29.706
Have a great summer, everyone. Bye.

22:10.122 --> 22:13.792
<i>Yup. One big happy family.</i>
