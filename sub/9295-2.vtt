00:13.384 --> 00:14.050
Listen, I've been thinking

00:14.118 --> 00:15.451
a lot about what we talked about.

00:15.519 --> 00:17.288
I want to move back to Los Angeles with you.

00:17.356 --> 00:18.523
Really?

00:18.591 --> 00:19.924
Yeah.

00:19.992 --> 00:21.125
You're coming with us tonight?

00:21.193 --> 00:22.193
If it's okay.

00:22.260 --> 00:23.494
Dad, I don't know what to say.

00:23.561 --> 00:24.494
I'm so happy!

00:24.562 --> 00:26.096
Victor, what are you doing here?

00:26.163 --> 00:27.797
How the hell did you find me?

00:27.865 --> 00:29.165
I have information. I'm out.

00:29.233 --> 00:30.666
I don't work for the government anymore.

00:30.734 --> 00:32.101
Well, this you're gonna want to hear.

00:32.168 --> 00:33.602
There's a big hit going down.

00:33.670 --> 00:35.270
President Hassan at the UN,

00:35.338 --> 00:36.504
he's getting taken out.

00:36.572 --> 00:37.672
When? Today,

00:37.740 --> 00:39.373
before he can sign this thing with Taylor.

00:39.441 --> 00:42.777
My country agrees to abandon
the pursuit of nuclear weapons.

00:42.844 --> 00:45.646
But our terms, Mr. President,

00:45.714 --> 00:47.181
were that the inspectors themselves

00:47.249 --> 00:49.717
would be American, not IAEA.

00:49.784 --> 00:52.119
This is the message that you
send to the rest of the world,

00:52.187 --> 00:53.386
and then you wonder why we
don't want to negotiate!

00:53.454 --> 00:54.453
Farhad.

00:54.521 --> 00:56.288
Please excuse my brother's passion.

00:56.356 --> 00:57.555
We need to resolve this issue

00:57.623 --> 00:58.789
before we can move forward.

00:58.856 --> 01:00.390
Find a way to give him what he wants.

01:00.458 --> 01:02.692
This man is a once-in-a-lifetime leader.

01:02.760 --> 01:05.428
I'm, uh, stuck outside.

01:05.495 --> 01:06.728
I'll take care of it.

01:06.796 --> 01:09.563
This woman poses no threat
to me or the peace process.

01:09.631 --> 01:10.997
But you are married.

01:11.065 --> 01:12.932
I've done nothing reckless.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.001
Just reinstate Ms. Reed's clearance now.

01:15.069 --> 01:17.670
Unless you want to destroy
everything that he's worked for,

01:17.737 --> 01:19.304
stay away from him.

01:19.372 --> 01:21.673
The brother revoked my clearance,

01:21.740 --> 01:23.241
but I had Hassan reinstate it.

01:23.308 --> 01:26.076
I know I'm behind schedule,
but it'll get done.

01:26.144 --> 01:27.811
Excuse me, Mr. Hastings.

01:27.879 --> 01:30.180
Jack Bauer's on line three.
He needs to talk to you.

01:30.248 --> 01:31.515
Bauer?

01:31.582 --> 01:33.483
<i>I'm with an informant
that I used to run</i>

01:33.551 --> 01:35.118
who's claiming he's got intel
on an assassination attempt

01:35.185 --> 01:36.552
on President Hassan.

01:36.620 --> 01:39.588
And what does Mr. Aruz want
in return for his information?

01:39.656 --> 01:41.256
CTU protection and immunity.

01:41.324 --> 01:43.191
I'll send a chopper to pick you up.

01:45.960 --> 01:47.593
Don't stop for anything! Keep going!

01:55.934 --> 01:58.401
You need to get him out of here!
He's losing a lot of blood!

01:58.469 --> 02:00.403
Hastings wants to debrief you back at CTU.

02:00.471 --> 02:02.238
I'm not going back to CTU.
I delivered him, I'm done.

02:02.306 --> 02:03.006
No, Mr. Bauer...

02:03.073 --> 02:04.607
I got a flight to catch.

02:04.675 --> 02:05.474
That's it?

02:06.245 --> 02:07.282
Get down!

02:11.986 --> 02:13.585
Tell me what you know.

02:13.653 --> 02:16.221
The hitter has someone on the inside...

02:16.288 --> 02:18.623
close to Hassan.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:35.171 --> 02:39.173
It's done. Aruz is no longer a problem.

02:39.240 --> 02:42.742
But we don't know how much he told CTU.

02:42.809 --> 02:46.045
We need to accelerate the hit.

02:51.017 --> 02:52.284
Sir, Agent Ortiz is calling in.

02:52.352 --> 02:55.353
Put him through. I want everyone on this.

02:55.421 --> 02:58.622
Comm channel 235. All right, go ahead.

02:58.690 --> 03:00.924
This is Cole. Where are those EMTs?

03:00.992 --> 03:02.292
They should be there any second.

03:02.360 --> 03:03.626
How's the rest of your team?

03:03.694 --> 03:06.595
Earley's injured.
Torres and Johnson are dead.

03:06.663 --> 03:07.996
What happened? Look, those drones

03:08.064 --> 03:09.831
are supposed to have antiballistics.

03:09.899 --> 03:11.666
Why didn't they take out the missile?

03:11.733 --> 03:13.100
We're still running the diagnostic.

03:13.168 --> 03:14.735
Sir, this should've never happened!

03:14.803 --> 03:16.803
We should've had another team
checking those buildings!

03:16.871 --> 03:19.172
We can discuss this at a later time,

03:19.240 --> 03:20.673
Agent Ortiz.

03:20.741 --> 03:22.141
Yes, sir.

03:22.209 --> 03:23.809
Bauer wants to talk with you.

03:23.877 --> 03:25.611
Put him on the phone.

03:25.679 --> 03:26.712
Stand by.

03:26.780 --> 03:30.449
Jack, I have Mr. Hastings on the line.

03:30.517 --> 03:32.418
Mr. Hastings?

03:32.486 --> 03:34.954
Victor Aruz told me right before
he died that the assassin is

03:35.022 --> 03:37.858
working with someone very
close to President Hassan.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.360
Did you get a name?

03:39.428 --> 03:40.928
No, not before he died.

03:40.996 --> 03:42.664
You believe him? Normally,
I wouldn't trust him

03:42.731 --> 03:44.199
as far as I could throw him.

03:44.266 --> 03:45.500
He was dying, sir.

03:45.568 --> 03:46.935
He had no reason to lie.

03:47.003 --> 03:48.471
All right. We're on it.

03:48.539 --> 03:50.540
I need you and Cole back here to debrief.

03:50.607 --> 03:52.943
Mr. Hastings, I already gave one
of your agents my statement.

03:53.010 --> 03:54.679
I need you back here.

03:54.747 --> 03:57.582
Yeah... Mr. Bauer?

04:03.290 --> 04:05.492
Fine. We're on our way.

04:09.698 --> 04:11.232
Mr. Hastings.

04:11.300 --> 04:12.300
Yes?

04:12.368 --> 04:15.003
I may have a lead on that insider.

04:15.071 --> 04:16.672
What do you mean? I just picked up

04:16.740 --> 04:18.974
an unauthorized access in
one of the secure databases

04:19.041 --> 04:20.041
at the UN.

04:20.110 --> 04:21.476
How do you know it's unauthorized?

04:21.545 --> 04:23.413
Because they bypassed the main access page

04:23.480 --> 04:25.214
and went through a back-end server.

04:25.281 --> 04:27.549
The only reason to do that

04:27.616 --> 04:29.749
is if you're trying to cover your tracks.

04:29.817 --> 04:31.250
Stay on it. Let me know
if you trace the source.

04:31.317 --> 04:32.751
And put O'Brian on this, too,

04:32.818 --> 04:34.518
if you don't think she'll slow you down.

04:34.586 --> 04:36.184
No. She's doing much better, sir.

04:36.252 --> 04:37.919
I'm gonna call Taylor's chief of staff.

04:37.986 --> 04:40.520
They need to know this insider
could be moving against Hassan.

04:40.588 --> 04:43.388
Mr. President, you are under a
great deal of pressure at home

04:43.455 --> 04:45.189
from an active opposition
to this peace agreement.

04:45.256 --> 04:46.856
They believe that by dismantling

04:46.924 --> 04:48.357
your nuclear weapons programs,

04:48.425 --> 04:49.791
you're surrendering to the West.

04:49.859 --> 04:51.391
How do you respond to those charges?

04:51.459 --> 04:54.124
The only thing we are surrendering is

04:54.192 --> 04:55.526
the cloud of antagonism and mistrust

04:55.594 --> 04:58.395
under which we have lived for far too long.

04:58.463 --> 05:00.430
This is a victory for my people.

05:00.498 --> 05:04.167
It marks an end to isolation and
will bring economic stability

05:04.234 --> 05:07.203
to my country for the first time in decades.

05:08.506 --> 05:09.706
How do you propose economic stability

05:09.774 --> 05:11.241
when your people are so divided?

05:11.309 --> 05:13.376
This is Weiss. Did you bring in Victor Aruz?

05:13.444 --> 05:14.377
I'm afraid not, sir.

05:14.445 --> 05:15.678
There was an ambush,

05:15.746 --> 05:17.847
and Aruz was killed,
along with two of our men.

05:17.915 --> 05:19.916
Damn it.

05:19.984 --> 05:21.317
Before Aruz died, he shared

05:21.385 --> 05:22.986
some very troubling information.

05:23.053 --> 05:25.321
Now, he claimed that someone close

05:25.389 --> 05:27.690
to President Hassan has been
conspiring with the assassin.

05:27.758 --> 05:30.793
Now, we don't have a name yet,
but we are pursuing a lead.

05:30.860 --> 05:33.028
Tell me how, and I'd better be impressed.

05:33.096 --> 05:35.731
We're tracing what might
be an unauthorized entry

05:35.799 --> 05:37.433
into one of the UN servers.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.068
And you think this is the
person we're looking for?

05:39.135 --> 05:40.135
Well, we're optimistic.

05:40.203 --> 05:41.303
Yeah, you better hope that optimism

05:41.370 --> 05:42.303
translates into results.

05:42.371 --> 05:43.972
Sir, until we locate the insider,

05:44.040 --> 05:46.842
you might want to consider
locking down President Hassan

05:46.910 --> 05:48.777
and postponing this conference.

05:48.845 --> 05:50.546
That is not an option, Mr. Hastings.

05:50.613 --> 05:53.414
We are close to signing one
of the most important treaties

05:53.482 --> 05:54.849
in the history of this country.

05:54.916 --> 05:57.018
You were put in charge
of CTU because you said

05:57.085 --> 05:58.452
you could get the job done.

05:58.520 --> 06:00.353
"Lean, mean and fast," that's what you said.

06:00.421 --> 06:02.422
President Taylor expects you
to deliver on those words.

06:02.490 --> 06:03.623
Yes, sir.

06:03.691 --> 06:06.726
I'll take this to the president.
Keep me posted.

06:06.793 --> 06:10.097
President Hassan and I still
have a great deal of work to do,

06:10.165 --> 06:12.168
so we're gonna wrap this up,

06:12.236 --> 06:14.938
but I would like to say that
the president and I chose

06:15.006 --> 06:17.607
the United Nations as the
venue for these talks

06:17.675 --> 06:19.576
because the problems facing
the Middle East have become

06:19.644 --> 06:21.578
a world concern.

06:21.646 --> 06:25.415
And President Hassan and I are confident

06:25.483 --> 06:27.517
that this agreement will lay the foundation

06:27.585 --> 06:29.920
for a lasting peace in the region.

06:29.987 --> 06:32.856
And we thank you for your time. Thank you.

06:34.859 --> 06:36.159
Mr. President,

06:36.227 --> 06:38.462
I'll see you after the break.

06:38.529 --> 06:40.463
I look forward to resuming it.

06:40.530 --> 06:42.030
Thank you.

06:46.401 --> 06:48.335
Madam President, I just spoke with CTU.

06:48.403 --> 06:50.203
There's been a development
regarding the threat to Hassan.

06:50.271 --> 06:53.005
We need to speak in private.

06:55.575 --> 06:57.141
That is really wonderful.

06:57.208 --> 06:58.742
Thank you. I'll join you later.

07:06.884 --> 07:07.984
Hello.

07:08.052 --> 07:09.519
You were terrific.

07:09.586 --> 07:11.887
It's not about me,

07:11.955 --> 07:13.455
it's the message that's important.

07:13.523 --> 07:16.558
I just hope no one could
see how nervous I was.

07:16.626 --> 07:18.560
Well, you hid it well.

07:18.627 --> 07:19.560
Are you here?

07:19.628 --> 07:21.362
Yes, on my way up.

07:21.430 --> 07:23.031
Do you still have time to see me?

07:23.098 --> 07:25.733
I've been looking forward to it all day.

07:25.801 --> 07:27.702
When?

07:29.071 --> 07:31.406
What did you say?

07:31.473 --> 07:33.207
When can I see you?

07:33.275 --> 07:35.510
I've got half an hour before
the next session begins.

07:35.577 --> 07:37.745
You meet me now, and we'll go up

07:37.812 --> 07:39.413
to my private office together.

07:39.480 --> 07:41.581
I'll tell my staff that
you requested an interview

07:41.649 --> 07:44.083
Perfect. I'll be right there.

07:48.320 --> 07:50.253
I just ran a systems check on the drone.

07:50.321 --> 07:51.554
Sensors did pick up the missile,

07:51.622 --> 07:52.588
but the drone didn't fire.

07:52.656 --> 07:53.889
Why not?

07:53.956 --> 07:56.390
I won't know until I have
a chance to take it apart.

07:56.458 --> 07:58.424
Mr. Hastings,

07:58.492 --> 08:01.090
I don't want to sound like
I'm covering my own ass.

08:01.158 --> 08:03.821
but I did tell you that
the antimissile system

08:03.889 --> 08:06.556
had not been tested in an urban environment.

08:06.624 --> 08:08.024
I know what you said, Arlo.

08:08.091 --> 08:11.792
You just find out what went
wrong and you get back to me.

08:12.961 --> 08:14.127
Mr. Hastings, I was right.

08:14.195 --> 08:15.895
Someone hacked into the UN database.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.663
They downloaded security protocols,

08:17.731 --> 08:21.132
the schematics to the UN and
Hassan's personal itinerary.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.301
I was able to trace an IP address.

08:23.368 --> 08:24.469
Did you get a name?

08:24.536 --> 08:25.603
Chloe's into the computer's registry.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.672
She should have it by now.

08:27.740 --> 08:29.743
Almost there. Come on, Chloe.

08:29.811 --> 08:32.279
Saying that isn't gonna
make it happen any faster.

08:36.187 --> 08:39.792
There, the computer's owner is listed

08:39.860 --> 08:41.092
as Meredith Michelle Reed.

08:41.159 --> 08:43.291
<i>She's a reporter working for
the New York Courier.</i>

08:43.359 --> 08:44.960
She's doing a profile on Hassan.

08:45.027 --> 08:46.961
Applied for a security clearance at the UN.

08:47.029 --> 08:47.695
Did she get it?

08:47.762 --> 08:48.796
My God... What?

08:48.864 --> 08:49.932
She's there now.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.737
UN Security logged her in 15 minutes ago.

08:51.804 --> 08:52.905
She's at the press conference.

08:52.973 --> 08:54.373
Put me through to UN Security.

08:55.875 --> 08:57.375
You're clear. Go ahead.

08:57.443 --> 08:59.176
Thank you.

09:08.618 --> 09:09.784
Okay, go ahead.

09:09.852 --> 09:11.719
This is Brian Hastings,

09:11.787 --> 09:13.087
director of CTU.

09:13.154 --> 09:15.322
We have a possible o
n-site threat to President Hassan.

09:15.390 --> 09:16.323
Do you have an ID?

09:16.390 --> 09:17.790
Her name is Meredith Reed.

09:17.858 --> 09:20.493
She has a press security clearance.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.895
We're sending a photograph to your PDA.

09:22.962 --> 09:25.397
We just got a call about a
threat to President Hassan.

09:25.464 --> 09:28.099
The UN gave us access to
their surveillance feed.

09:28.167 --> 09:30.702
Facial recognition software
is sweeping the area now.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.444
Got a match.

09:39.511 --> 09:41.679
Northeast corner, moving toward Hassan.

09:41.747 --> 09:42.847
Located the suspect.

09:42.915 --> 09:44.449
She's ten yards from Hassan,

09:44.516 --> 09:46.618
east side of the press section.

09:46.685 --> 09:47.652
Green top,

09:47.720 --> 09:49.854
black skirt, black jacket!

09:55.861 --> 09:58.096
There she is. Go, go, go, go, go, go!

09:58.164 --> 10:00.365
Everybody, move back!
Move back! What are you doing?

10:00.433 --> 10:03.167
I'm a reporter. I have clearance.

10:03.235 --> 10:04.702
Move back!

10:04.770 --> 10:06.171
Meredith?

10:06.238 --> 10:09.107
I'm a journalist! I'm a journalist.
I have credentials.

10:09.175 --> 10:11.309
We got a call from CTU about
a threat to your life.

10:11.377 --> 10:12.310
Keep moving, keep moving.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.147
Mr. President...

10:21.487 --> 10:22.420
Come on!

10:22.488 --> 10:24.489
You're making a mistake.

10:34.412 --> 10:36.346
The suspect's name is Meredith Reed.

10:36.414 --> 10:38.715
She's a journalist profiling Hassan.

10:38.783 --> 10:43.086
Now, our operating theory is
that she's been using her access

10:43.153 --> 10:44.220
to gain security intel,

10:44.288 --> 10:45.721
which she's been feeding to the assassin.

10:47.290 --> 10:50.859
Ms. Reed is being transported
back here right now.

10:50.927 --> 10:53.561
My hope is that she will give
us the name of the assassin

10:53.629 --> 10:55.697
so that we can put an end to this threat.

10:55.764 --> 10:58.136
Refer to your digital briefing
packets for specifics.

10:58.203 --> 11:00.574
Mr. Hastings, I just received a

11:00.642 --> 11:01.742
preliminary report from the team

11:01.810 --> 11:02.943
sweeping Ms. Reed's apartment.

11:03.011 --> 11:04.078
And?

11:04.146 --> 11:05.246
They recovered the files

11:05.313 --> 11:07.248
stolen from the UN database off her laptop.

11:07.316 --> 11:08.817
It looks like we found our insider.

11:08.885 --> 11:11.253
They also found a large file
that couldn't be opened.

11:11.320 --> 11:12.754
It's been encrypted with
intelligence grade software.

11:12.822 --> 11:14.222
I want you to find out

11:14.290 --> 11:15.590
what's inside that file.

11:15.658 --> 11:18.293
It's on its way over as we speak. Good.

11:18.361 --> 11:19.528
Excuse me, does anyone think this happened

11:19.596 --> 11:21.130
a little too fast and a little too easily?

11:21.197 --> 11:23.332
You know, Chloe, things do
happen a little faster in here

11:23.399 --> 11:25.400
than what you're used to.
I know, you keep reminding me.

11:25.467 --> 11:27.135
I might not be up to speed
on all your software,

11:27.203 --> 11:29.171
but I know if someone
doesn't want to be found,

11:29.239 --> 11:30.773
they don't leave behind code fragments

11:30.840 --> 11:33.075
that could lead to an I.P.
address. Unless, of course,

11:33.143 --> 11:35.278
they were in a hurry and
they had to improvise.

11:35.345 --> 11:37.380
Maybe, but then why would you
go through all that trouble

11:37.448 --> 11:39.282
and leave a huge red flag
for everyone to find?

11:39.350 --> 11:40.416
What is your point?

11:40.484 --> 11:43.120
It's like someone wanted us to find her.

11:43.187 --> 11:47.291
I just think we should continue
to vet this until we're sure

11:47.359 --> 11:48.925
that we have the right person.

11:48.993 --> 11:50.958
We are vetting this from every angle.

11:51.026 --> 11:53.325
I appreciate your concerns.
We'll keep them in mind.

11:53.393 --> 11:54.859
In other words, "Shut up, Chloe."

11:54.927 --> 11:56.794
That's not what he said.
Well, that's what I heard.

11:56.862 --> 11:58.329
All right, you made your point.

11:58.397 --> 12:00.331
Chloe, thanks.

12:00.399 --> 12:02.333
All right, one last thing.

12:02.401 --> 12:05.770
Ms. Reed has spent a lot of time
on assignment in the Middle East.

12:05.837 --> 12:07.838
I want to cross-check all of her movements

12:07.906 --> 12:10.474
with those of known terrorist groups.

12:10.542 --> 12:11.475
Let's get moving.

12:11.543 --> 12:13.210
Chloe.

12:18.115 --> 12:21.016
Jack Bauer should be here any second.

12:21.084 --> 12:23.485
I want you to handle his debrief.

12:23.553 --> 12:25.787
You're taking me off the floor?

12:25.855 --> 12:28.156
I think you'll be better
utilized debriefing Mr. Bauer.

12:28.224 --> 12:29.257
Go set up.

12:29.325 --> 12:30.692
Thank you, sir.

12:38.033 --> 12:39.534
I'm walking in now.

12:39.601 --> 12:43.403
Give me the home phone numbers
for Torres and Johnson.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.237
Nobody speaks to their wives before me.

12:45.305 --> 12:47.840
Cole, before you make your report,
I want you to keep someing in md.

12:47.907 --> 12:49.074
What's that?

12:49.142 --> 12:51.610
I know you asked for
more boots on the ground,

12:51.677 --> 12:52.977
but what happened happened.

12:53.045 --> 12:54.745
There's nothing we can do about that.

12:54.813 --> 12:56.480
You put your opinion on record,

12:56.548 --> 12:59.149
it's going to flag an
internal review from division.

12:59.217 --> 13:01.985
It's only going to hurt us moving forward.

13:02.053 --> 13:03.720
We're clear.

13:05.724 --> 13:07.525
Mr. Bauer, Brian Hastings.

13:07.593 --> 13:09.094
Sorry about the loss of your men.

13:09.129 --> 13:12.431
Thank you. You'll be glad
to know the lead you got

13:12.499 --> 13:13.833
from Victor Aruz panned out.

13:13.900 --> 13:16.369
You telling me that you've
already found the insider?

13:16.436 --> 13:18.771
Her name's Meredith Reed. She's a
journalist who was covering the peace
conference.

13:18.839 --> 13:21.140
She was stealing files off the UN servers.

13:21.208 --> 13:23.508
Now, we wouldn't have gotten
this far without your help.

13:23.576 --> 13:24.910
Thank you.

13:24.978 --> 13:26.545
Now, Chloe O'Brian's waiting to debrief you.

13:26.613 --> 13:28.246
Shouldn't take long.

13:28.314 --> 13:30.715
I just need to make a phone call first.

13:30.782 --> 13:32.950
Excuse me.

13:34.286 --> 13:36.521
We need to be on the same page here.

13:36.588 --> 13:37.789
I think you can understand that.

13:37.856 --> 13:39.757
Sir, you're asking me to lie on the record.

13:39.825 --> 13:42.693
I'm asking you to exercise some discretion.

13:42.761 --> 13:45.229
There's an assassin out there.

13:45.297 --> 13:47.498
We don't need people secon
d-guessing how we do things.

13:47.566 --> 13:49.633
Well, maybe you'd like to debrief for me.

13:53.304 --> 13:55.239
All right, let's get you in here.

13:55.306 --> 13:56.373
Hello.

13:56.441 --> 13:58.075
Hey, sweetheart, it's me.

13:58.142 --> 13:59.376
Hey, where are you?

13:59.444 --> 14:01.911
CTU.

14:01.979 --> 14:03.981
CTU? Does this have anythingo do

14:04.049 --> 14:05.616
with what's going on at the UN?

14:05.684 --> 14:07.118
Yes, but I promise I won't be long.

14:07.185 --> 14:08.552
I just need to give them a statement.

14:08.620 --> 14:09.920
But I'm going to have

14:09.988 --> 14:11.422
to meet you at the airport.

14:11.489 --> 14:13.391
Dad, what's going on?

14:13.458 --> 14:15.560
It's complicated.
I'll explain when I see you.

14:15.628 --> 14:17.628
Okay, but we're coming there to pick you up.

14:17.696 --> 14:18.896
Sweetheart, you don't need to do that.

14:18.964 --> 14:20.764
I want to. It's on the way.

14:20.832 --> 14:24.301
Okay, I'll have Chloe
get you a security pass.

14:24.368 --> 14:26.269
I'll see you soon. Bye.

14:26.337 --> 14:28.404
Who was that?

14:28.472 --> 14:29.705
My father.

14:29.773 --> 14:30.773
Everything all right?

14:30.841 --> 14:33.209
I'm not sure.

14:34.978 --> 14:36.845
Everyone said you were too young,

14:36.913 --> 14:38.447
and inexperienced to head up field ops,

14:38.515 --> 14:40.282
but I believed you could do the job.

14:40.350 --> 14:43.652
Now I need you to show the same
faith in me that I showed in you.

14:43.720 --> 14:45.321
Keep our little dispute off the record.

14:45.388 --> 14:47.422
Where's Chloe?

14:47.490 --> 14:49.925
She's upstairs. First room to the right.

14:49.992 --> 14:52.360
Thank you.

14:54.364 --> 14:56.465
Think about what I said.

15:06.609 --> 15:07.776
Hey.

15:07.844 --> 15:09.177
Hey, Jack.

15:09.245 --> 15:11.413
Sorry, but we got to do this kind of quick.

15:11.981 --> 15:13.382
I guess you heard about the
reporter they arrested.

15:13.950 --> 15:15.283
Yeah. Well, I think we might

15:15.351 --> 15:16.351
have the wrong person.

15:16.419 --> 15:17.785
Meredith Reed could be innocent.

15:17.853 --> 15:19.687
Hastings said they found
evidence on her computer.

15:19.755 --> 15:22.156
I know, but I think those
files may have been planted.

15:22.224 --> 15:24.491
Look, I've been scanning
through the trafc cam footage

15:24.559 --> 15:26.159
from outside Meredith
Reed's apartment building.

15:26.227 --> 15:27.727
Five minutes before the intrusion

15:27.795 --> 15:30.063
to the UN server, this man was going

15:30.131 --> 15:31.797
into the service entrance of the building.

15:31.865 --> 15:33.799
Ten minutes later, he left.

15:33.867 --> 15:36.201
What if he went into her
apartment and used her laptop

15:36.269 --> 15:37.736
to break into the servers?

15:37.803 --> 15:39.571
Sounds a little thin.

15:39.638 --> 15:41.439
Don't you think we found her kind of fast,

15:41.507 --> 15:43.074
and that it was a little too easy?

15:43.141 --> 15:44.308
Why are you showing me this?

15:44.376 --> 15:45.876
Why don't you just take it to Hastings?

15:45.944 --> 15:47.244
Hastings doesn't think
I know what I'm doing.

15:47.312 --> 15:49.082
He won't listen to me.
He might listen to you.

15:49.150 --> 15:50.517
Chloe, I'm here for my debrief.

15:50.585 --> 15:52.053
Kim's on her way.

15:52.121 --> 15:53.588
I'm leaving on a plane to Los Angeles

15:53.656 --> 15:54.690
with my family in an hour.

15:54.758 --> 15:57.159
I'm just asking you to talk to him.

15:57.227 --> 15:58.728
It'll take ten minutes.

15:58.795 --> 16:00.396
If the assassin framed Reed

16:00.464 --> 16:01.630
to create a diversio

16:01.698 --> 16:03.766
that means we have the
wrong person in custody.

16:03.834 --> 16:06.001
That he still has someone
inside Hassan's delegation.

16:06.069 --> 16:09.238
I'm sorry, Chloe, it's not my problem.

16:09.306 --> 16:11.307
Please, let's just
continue with the debrief.

16:15.513 --> 16:18.381
<i>Nor will they confirm any fatalities.</i>

16:18.449 --> 16:20.784
There is no evidence at this
time to support the theory

16:20.852 --> 16:23.221
that the two incidents are related.

16:23.288 --> 16:24.890
We're still waiting for
an official statement

16:24.958 --> 16:27.192
as to why this reporter was arrested.

16:27.260 --> 16:30.562
At this time we can confirm that
her name is Meredith Reed...

16:30.630 --> 16:32.030
I'm so gd you're all right.

16:32.098 --> 16:33.765
I can't believe this happened.

16:33.833 --> 16:36.100
...has yet to comment. In other news...

16:36.168 --> 16:37.602
It's hard to believe, Kayla.

16:37.669 --> 16:40.804
I just don't understand how
this woman got so close to you.

16:40.872 --> 16:42.272
She's a journalist.

16:42.339 --> 16:44.304
She had security clearance.

16:44.372 --> 16:46.639
Do all reporters get these clearances?

16:46.707 --> 16:48.873
No, but she's writing an article on me.

16:48.941 --> 16:50.374
You know that, Dalia.

16:50.442 --> 16:51.909
She was given special access.

16:51.977 --> 16:53.610
You gave her that access?

16:53.678 --> 16:56.579
Yes, I did. I did it.

16:56.647 --> 16:58.914
This article was important for me.

16:58.982 --> 17:01.783
I wanted to get my message
across to the American public.

17:01.851 --> 17:03.418
That's the only reason?

17:03.486 --> 17:05.720
Yes, that's the only reason!
What other reason?

17:05.788 --> 17:07.387
If you have something to say, then say it.

17:07.455 --> 17:10.023
You should never have
let her into our lives.

17:10.090 --> 17:11.592
You put us all in danger.

17:11.659 --> 17:12.826
Please, stop.

17:14.428 --> 17:16.162
Excuse me.

17:16.230 --> 17:19.131
I just spoke to the UN press director.

17:19.199 --> 17:20.598
We're going to make a public statement.

17:20.666 --> 17:22.666
Make sure I see it first.

17:27.806 --> 17:29.974
Omar, may I speak with you alone?

17:49.793 --> 17:51.694
Excuse us.

17:58.601 --> 18:01.703
They've taken Meredith Reed to CTU.

18:02.906 --> 18:05.107
I can't believe she's part of this.

18:05.174 --> 18:09.945
What reason could she have
to help someone kill me?

18:10.012 --> 18:13.682
What reason does any American
have to do anything? Money.

18:13.749 --> 18:16.818
They found incriminating
files on her computer, Omar.

18:16.886 --> 18:19.254
Whether you want to believe
it or not, she is guilty.

18:19.322 --> 18:20.555
And she's going to talk.

18:20.623 --> 18:23.358
I need to know what she's going to tell them

18:23.425 --> 18:25.193
about your relationship.

18:25.261 --> 18:27.662
Be honest with me.

18:27.730 --> 18:29.063
Tell me everything.

18:31.300 --> 18:35.536
It started three months ago in B'Dar.

18:35.604 --> 18:42.110
We met for an interview in her hotel room.

18:42.177 --> 18:45.513
Dalia and I had been fighting that day.

18:45.580 --> 18:46.981
She used you, Omar.

18:47.049 --> 18:49.583
She almost cost you your life.

18:49.651 --> 18:51.118
And if this affair becomes public,

18:51.186 --> 18:52.486
it will destroy your credibility

18:52.554 --> 18:53.854
and everything that you've worked for.

18:53.922 --> 18:56.357
I don't need you to tell
me the consequences.

18:56.424 --> 19:00.093
If she talks to the Americans,
you must deny it.

19:00.161 --> 19:01.628
It never happened.

19:03.798 --> 19:05.432
Look, Omar, I know you're thinking

19:05.500 --> 19:08.702
you must do the honorable
thing and confess the truth.

19:08.770 --> 19:11.071
That would be a terrible mistake.

19:16.411 --> 19:18.545
I need to be with my family.

19:32.260 --> 19:33.493
Yes?

19:33.561 --> 19:35.261
I just spoke with my brother.

19:35.329 --> 19:37.130
I told him to deny the affair.

19:37.198 --> 19:38.665
What did he say?

19:38.732 --> 19:40.100
He's going to consider it.

19:40.167 --> 19:41.634
Press him harder.

19:41.702 --> 19:45.338
The reporter's claims
need to be discredited.

19:45.405 --> 19:49.508
CTU needs to continue to think
she's my contact on the inside.

19:49.576 --> 19:50.775
I understand.

19:50.843 --> 19:53.044
We only need another hour.

19:53.112 --> 19:55.613
I'll be ready to move by then.

20:07.033 --> 20:08.401
Arlo. Hey.

20:08.968 --> 20:10.535
I need your help decrypting that file

20:10.603 --> 20:11.903
they found on Reed's computer.

20:11.971 --> 20:14.338
I broke off a section.
It should be on your screen.

20:14.406 --> 20:16.407
What filter do you want
me to run it through?

20:16.474 --> 20:17.441
Esquire Nine.

20:17.508 --> 20:19.475
No problem.

20:19.543 --> 20:20.577
And, Arlo--

20:20.644 --> 20:22.545
you can stop staring at my breasts now.

20:22.613 --> 20:25.048
So when are you going
to drop Captain America

20:25.115 --> 20:26.482
and find yourself a real man?

20:26.550 --> 20:29.818
I'm still thinking about it.

20:29.886 --> 20:31.420
Well, don't take too long.

20:31.487 --> 20:33.054
I might lose interest.

20:34.189 --> 20:35.456
Let me know what you find.

20:38.826 --> 20:41.227
Dana Walsh.

20:41.295 --> 20:43.296
Hello?

20:45.265 --> 20:47.365
Dana Walsh.

20:47.433 --> 20:48.699
I like that.

20:48.767 --> 20:51.034
You picked a good name for yourself.

20:51.102 --> 20:53.102
That's actually better than the
one your mama picked for you.

20:53.170 --> 20:56.206
Whoever this is,
I told you to stop calling me.

20:56.274 --> 20:59.077
Yeah, I know what you told me, Jenny.

20:59.145 --> 21:01.584
My name is not Jenny.

21:01.652 --> 21:04.320
You must be mistaking me for someone else.

21:04.388 --> 21:05.321
Oh, am I?

21:05.389 --> 21:07.256
Yes.

21:07.324 --> 21:08.391
That's funny.

21:08.459 --> 21:10.126
'Cause you sound a lot like this girl

21:10.194 --> 21:12.595
I used to know from Rock
Springs named Jenny Scott.

21:12.663 --> 21:14.363
She was a wild thing, man.

21:14.431 --> 21:16.532
We used to do some crazy stuff.

21:16.600 --> 21:19.435
The next time you call me,

21:19.503 --> 21:22.104
I promise you I will contact the police.

21:22.172 --> 21:24.406
Yeah? You know, I got a better idea.

21:24.474 --> 21:25.808
Let's contact them right now.

21:25.875 --> 21:27.376
I'm hanging up now.

21:27.444 --> 21:28.744
Hey, don't hang up this phone.

21:28.812 --> 21:30.012
I'm warning you, Jenny,

21:30.080 --> 21:31.080
do not...

21:33.951 --> 21:35.284
Hey.

21:37.287 --> 21:38.220
Hey.

21:38.288 --> 21:40.155
Whoa.

21:40.223 --> 21:42.925
I was just going to look for you.

21:44.828 --> 21:47.163
I'm so glad that you're okay.

21:50.735 --> 21:55.138
I'm sorry that I have
been so distant lately.

21:55.206 --> 21:57.440
It's just...

21:57.508 --> 22:00.309
I don't ever want to lose you.

22:00.377 --> 22:02.478
Don't worry.

22:08.018 --> 22:10.286
Why am I here? This is a mistake.

22:10.354 --> 22:13.190
Damn it. Who's in charge here?

22:13.258 --> 22:14.491
Tell Mr. Weiss there's nothing yet.

22:14.559 --> 22:17.361
But I'll call him as soon
as we have news. Thanks.

22:17.429 --> 22:20.198
Brian Hastings, director of CTU.

22:20.266 --> 22:22.164
Look, I don't know who the
hell you people think you are.

22:22.232 --> 22:24.165
But I want an attorney, and I demand to know

22:24.233 --> 22:25.833
what I'm being charged with.

22:25.901 --> 22:27.502
We found the files, Ms. Reed.

22:27.569 --> 22:29.003
What files?

22:29.071 --> 22:30.271
On your computer. In your apartment.

22:30.338 --> 22:32.471
You searched my apartment?

22:32.538 --> 22:33.972
We found six documents

22:34.040 --> 22:36.707
on your laptop that were
stolen from the UN servers.

22:36.775 --> 22:38.841
What documents?

22:38.909 --> 22:40.876
Relating to the security arrangements

22:40.944 --> 22:41.877
for the peace conference.

22:41.945 --> 22:43.645
You're here because we know

22:43.713 --> 22:48.684
that you're part of a plan to
assassinate President Hassan.

22:48.752 --> 22:50.987
What? What?

22:51.054 --> 22:52.855
Please don't waste my time.

22:52.923 --> 22:54.823
The evidence against you is clear-cut.

22:54.891 --> 22:57.526
No, no, no. Listen to me.
You're making a mistake.

22:57.594 --> 22:59.027
If there are files

22:59.095 --> 23:01.496
on my computer, then someone put them there.

23:01.564 --> 23:02.897
Now you listen to me.

23:02.965 --> 23:04.632
I'm giving you a chance to help yourself

23:04.700 --> 23:06.033
by telling us what you know.

23:06.101 --> 23:08.871
I need the name of the assassin,
how to find them.

23:08.939 --> 23:11.574
And we talk about you
avoiding the death penalty.

23:11.642 --> 23:15.011
You're wrong.

23:15.078 --> 23:17.213
You've got the wrong person.

23:19.049 --> 23:21.016
Take her to interrogation.

23:21.084 --> 23:23.652
Full biometric package.
I'll be there shortly.

23:23.720 --> 23:25.020
This way, ma'am.

23:31.828 --> 23:32.927
Mr. Hastings?

23:32.995 --> 23:35.230
You're done with your debrief?

23:35.297 --> 23:36.898
Yeah. Can I talk to you?

23:36.966 --> 23:38.900
Not a good time, Mr. Bauer.

23:38.968 --> 23:41.503
Meredith Reed might be
telling you the truth.

23:41.571 --> 23:43.606
Is this coming from O'Brian?

23:43.673 --> 23:45.040
I told her to drop this.

23:45.108 --> 23:46.374
Yeah, well, she didn't.

23:46.442 --> 23:49.310
She found this. They were
taken from traffic cams

23:49.377 --> 23:52.280
near Ms. Reed's apartment.
Check out the time stamps.

23:52.348 --> 23:54.683
It shows this man entering the
building through the service entrance

23:54.750 --> 23:57.686
almost five minutes before the
intrusion into the UN servers.

23:57.753 --> 23:58.687
It shows him leaving the building

23:58.754 --> 24:00.555
almost immediately after. So?

24:00.623 --> 24:01.622
Chloe talked to the building manager.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.090
There was no scheduled maintenance today,

24:03.158 --> 24:04.859
no packages delivered.

24:04.926 --> 24:06.627
And this is your evidence?

24:06.695 --> 24:07.928
I'm looking at an apartment building,

24:07.996 --> 24:09.063
where dozens of people live,

24:09.131 --> 24:10.297
coming and going all day long.

24:10.365 --> 24:12.233
Look, I understand. All I'm saying is that

24:12.301 --> 24:14.101
it is possible that someone
broke into the apartment

24:14.169 --> 24:15.636
and used her computer
to steal the documents.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.605
All you need to do is send a
couple agents to check it out.

24:17.672 --> 24:19.406
I'm sorry, I just don't see it.

24:19.474 --> 24:21.108
And I can't waste valuable resources

24:21.176 --> 24:24.111
because Chloe O'Brian has a theory.

24:24.178 --> 24:27.281
Chloe and I have worked
together for a long time.

24:27.348 --> 24:30.117
And trust me. She's someone
you might want to listen to.

24:30.184 --> 24:32.719
She's very good at what she does.

24:32.787 --> 24:34.621
And if she's right, the assassin's

24:34.689 --> 24:36.056
got you looking in the wrong place,

24:36.124 --> 24:37.557
and you will get bit.

24:37.625 --> 24:41.194
Mr. Bauer, I have a suspect in hand

24:41.262 --> 24:44.464
with a file she felt
damning enough to encrypt.

24:44.532 --> 24:46.466
That's where I'm going
to focus my resources.

24:46.534 --> 24:47.801
Now, if you will excuse me.

24:53.207 --> 24:55.208
I hate this place.

25:01.983 --> 25:03.584
He's not going to help, is he?

25:03.651 --> 25:05.219
We have to follow this lead.

25:05.286 --> 25:06.453
If they have the wrong person...

25:06.521 --> 25:08.521
Chloe, I did what you asked.
I talked to Hastings.

25:08.589 --> 25:10.357
If he doesn't want to listen,
that's his mistake.

25:10.424 --> 25:11.724
But it's not my problem.

25:11.792 --> 25:13.359
To be honest with you,
it's not yours, either.

25:13.427 --> 25:15.361
What about the threat against Hassan?

25:15.429 --> 25:16.463
What about the peace conference?

25:16.530 --> 25:17.630
Doesn't any of that matter to you?

25:17.698 --> 25:19.332
What if Hastings knows something you don't?

25:23.070 --> 25:24.304
Look, I'm sorry.

25:26.173 --> 25:29.575
Kim's waiting for me outside.

25:29.643 --> 25:31.610
I've got to go.

25:31.678 --> 25:32.812
Jack!

25:34.180 --> 25:36.982
You've come to me for help many times,

25:37.050 --> 25:38.583
and I've never let you down.

25:38.651 --> 25:40.151
You've asked me to do crazy things,

25:40.219 --> 25:43.520
and I've always taken your side.

25:45.190 --> 25:47.590
Please help me.

25:49.626 --> 25:51.927
I can't do this by myself.

25:55.364 --> 25:57.231
I'm sorry.

25:57.299 --> 25:58.499
I-I can't.

26:01.102 --> 26:04.036
Not this time. Not me.

26:17.783 --> 26:18.884
Hey.

26:18.952 --> 26:21.156
Look what I made!

26:21.223 --> 26:23.225
Let me see.

26:25.129 --> 26:27.230
That's Daddy. That's Mommy.

26:27.298 --> 26:28.732
And that's me and that's you.

26:28.800 --> 26:30.201
See? That's you, Grandpa.

26:30.268 --> 26:32.003
It's beautiful, sweetheart.

26:32.071 --> 26:34.039
Dad, we need to talk.

26:35.641 --> 26:37.309
Yeah. Here, honey.

26:37.377 --> 26:39.878
Why don't you get Daddy to
put you in the car seat?

26:39.946 --> 26:41.647
We're ready to go.

26:43.083 --> 26:44.416
What's wrong?

26:44.484 --> 26:46.084
I spoke to Chloe.

26:46.152 --> 26:48.287
She told me what's happening.
Chloe called you?

26:48.354 --> 26:50.289
No, I called her because
you wouldn't tell me

26:50.356 --> 26:52.958
what was going on, so I decided
to find out for myself.

26:53.026 --> 26:55.727
I know about the threat
to the peace conference,

26:55.795 --> 26:57.262
that CTU might have the wrong suspect.

26:57.330 --> 26:58.430
What's happening?

26:58.498 --> 27:00.966
Chloe had me make her
case to the head of CTU.

27:01.034 --> 27:02.134
He wasn't convinced,

27:02.202 --> 27:03.435
and he thinks he's got the right person.

27:03.503 --> 27:04.670
But if he's wrong,

27:04.737 --> 27:06.805
then there's still someone inside the UN

27:06.873 --> 27:08.340
who's working with this assassin?

27:08.407 --> 27:09.875
That's what Chloe thinks.

27:09.942 --> 27:11.543
What do you think?

27:11.610 --> 27:14.312
I think it's not my problem.

27:14.380 --> 27:16.447
Dad! What?

27:16.515 --> 27:17.815
I don't believe you.

27:17.883 --> 27:20.351
I've never known you to walk
away from something like this.

27:22.020 --> 27:24.155
If you have to stay, it's all right.

27:24.223 --> 27:25.790
You're not letting me down.

27:25.858 --> 27:26.958
I understand.

27:27.025 --> 27:28.893
Sweetheart, I want to go with you.

27:28.961 --> 27:30.428
I know you do.

27:30.496 --> 27:32.931
And there's nothing I want more
than for you to come with us.

27:32.999 --> 27:36.268
I have been waiting so long for this day.

27:36.336 --> 27:38.770
We both have.

27:38.838 --> 27:41.173
But if something terrible happens,

27:41.241 --> 27:44.110
and you could have done
something to stop it,

27:44.177 --> 27:46.112
I don't think you'd be
able to live with yourself.

27:51.219 --> 27:55.657
Dad, it's okay. You can go.

28:14.444 --> 28:15.878
As soon as I'm finished here,

28:15.945 --> 28:18.380
I will get on a plane and I will
be in Los Angeles, I promise.

28:20.684 --> 28:22.351
Just be careful, please.

28:22.419 --> 28:24.720
Come here.

28:24.788 --> 28:26.789
I will.

28:31.126 --> 28:32.225
I should tell Teri.

28:32.293 --> 28:35.660
No, no. Let me do it.

28:35.728 --> 28:37.693
Go ahead.

28:37.761 --> 28:39.759
Go.

28:44.129 --> 28:45.328
Okay.

28:47.564 --> 28:50.198
Go on.

28:53.235 --> 28:54.335
You okay?

28:54.403 --> 28:56.470
Yeah, I'm fine, but we should go.

28:56.538 --> 28:58.572
Sweetie...

28:58.639 --> 29:00.573
Grandpa has some work to do.
He can't fly with us.

29:00.641 --> 29:02.909
But he'll come as soon as he can.

29:02.976 --> 29:05.011
But he said he was coming today.

29:05.078 --> 29:06.712
No, not today.

29:06.780 --> 29:07.880
But soon, okay?

29:07.948 --> 29:09.681
All right, let's go.

29:13.486 --> 29:14.552
Jack...

29:14.620 --> 29:15.986
We need to find out where your suspect went

29:16.053 --> 29:17.219
after he left Miss Reed's apartment.

29:17.287 --> 29:19.587
Start checking traffic cams.

29:31.885 --> 29:33.386
Okay. I need to get a baseline

29:33.454 --> 29:36.489
on her respiratory,
cardio and dermal response,

29:36.557 --> 29:37.557
so make her comfortable.

29:37.625 --> 29:39.058
Start off with a few softball questions.

30:00.049 --> 30:03.919
Miss Reed, I think we need a fresh start.

30:03.987 --> 30:06.422
Now, you claim those files
were planted on your computer.

30:06.489 --> 30:08.891
Fine. I'm willing to give you
the benefit of the doubt,

30:08.959 --> 30:11.527
but you need to meet me halfway. Talk to me.

30:11.595 --> 30:13.829
Help me understand your side of the story.

30:13.897 --> 30:15.231
Fair enough?

30:17.233 --> 30:21.437
, when was the first time
you met President Hassan?

30:23.007 --> 30:25.709
About six months ago.

30:25.777 --> 30:27.744
At a conference

30:27.812 --> 30:29.177
of oil ministers.

30:29.244 --> 30:32.505
I requested an interview, and he agreed.

30:32.573 --> 30:37.604
We met in his hotel lobby twice.

30:37.672 --> 30:40.006
Hour, hour and a half,

30:40.074 --> 30:42.074
at the most.

30:50.281 --> 30:52.215
Madam President.

30:53.951 --> 30:55.118
Mr. President.

30:55.185 --> 30:56.452
I want to thank you

30:56.520 --> 30:59.121
for wanting to continue our negotiations.

30:59.189 --> 31:00.956
I know it's a risk.

31:01.024 --> 31:03.659
Madam President, you are no stranger

31:03.727 --> 31:05.294
to making personal sacrifices

31:05.362 --> 31:07.096
for your beliefs.

31:07.163 --> 31:11.366
If the price for peace is my lif so be it.

31:11.434 --> 31:13.268
Now, we are doing everything in our power

31:13.335 --> 31:14.936
to make sure that that doesn't happen.

31:15.004 --> 31:17.171
We've tightened security measures here,

31:17.239 --> 31:19.507
and CTU's top priority

31:19.575 --> 31:21.443
is to find the people who are targeting you.

31:21.510 --> 31:24.346
I appreciate that.

31:24.413 --> 31:26.514
Madam President,

31:26.582 --> 31:29.584
the woman you took into custody...

31:29.652 --> 31:31.086
The reporter. Meredith Reed.

31:31.153 --> 31:34.722
Yes. Is CTU certain that
she is part of this plan?

31:34.790 --> 31:37.954
Well, from what I understand,
the evidence against her

31:38.022 --> 31:40.589
is quite incriminating.

31:40.656 --> 31:42.156
Have they found out her reasons?

31:42.224 --> 31:44.024
Well, Miss Reed is being
questioned as we speak.

31:44.092 --> 31:46.626
I'll make sure whatever
information we get from her

31:46.693 --> 31:49.459
will be shared with your
people as soon as possible.

31:57.296 --> 31:59.030
Jack, I've searched through
all the traffic cams

31:59.098 --> 32:01.132
within a five-block radius
of Meredith Reed's apartment.

32:01.200 --> 32:02.900
There's no sign of where the suspect went.

32:02.968 --> 32:03.935
Can you check other sources?

32:04.002 --> 32:05.670
CTU has drones all over the city.

32:05.737 --> 32:07.104
I could look through their archives

32:07.172 --> 32:09.240
and see if they picked anything up.
Where are they?

32:09.308 --> 32:10.508
The archives are in Arlo's station.

32:10.576 --> 32:12.811
I don't have the clearance.

32:12.878 --> 32:15.179
Can you hack in?

32:15.246 --> 32:17.614
Yeah.

32:17.682 --> 32:19.849
Do it.

32:21.286 --> 32:24.021
I'm glad you're here. Thanks for staying.

32:24.089 --> 32:26.089
Yeah.

32:26.157 --> 32:27.323
This will all be over soon

32:27.391 --> 32:28.825
and you can get to California.

32:33.429 --> 32:34.563
Okay. I'm in.

32:37.034 --> 32:40.036
One of the drones picked him
up leaving Reed's apartment.

32:44.542 --> 32:46.342
Play it forward.

32:48.111 --> 32:49.945
Well, he hailed a cab when he left.

32:50.013 --> 32:51.647
Can you track the cab?

32:51.715 --> 32:53.683
No. It's beyond the drone's search grid.

32:53.751 --> 32:55.018
Okay, back it up.

32:57.254 --> 32:58.554
Stop.

32:58.622 --> 33:00.956
Move in closer.

33:01.024 --> 33:03.291
ere, that's what I want to see.

33:03.359 --> 33:05.060
Closer.

33:05.127 --> 33:06.795
See the medallion?

33:06.863 --> 33:08.697
Call t cab company, find out where it went.

33:08.765 --> 33:10.398
I'm not tracking this guy without a weapon.

33:10.466 --> 33:11.700
The Armory's on Level C.

33:11.767 --> 33:14.168
I have to input your palm print
through the hand scanner.

33:14.236 --> 33:16.404
Erase this as soon as I'm clear.

33:20.576 --> 33:22.610
I'll call you as soon as I'm on e road.

33:45.635 --> 33:46.735
Hello?

33:46.802 --> 33:48.936
Ruth, it's me. Jenny?

33:49.004 --> 33:50.871
I need to talk to you, are you alone?

33:50.939 --> 33:52.706
Uh, just my kid. What's going on?

33:52.773 --> 33:54.673
Haven't heard from you since Christmas.

33:54.741 --> 33:57.540
Kevin Wade found me.

33:57.608 --> 34:00.042
He's been calling me at
work the last two days.

34:00.110 --> 34:03.545
Damn it, Ruth, you told him how to find me?

34:03.612 --> 34:05.179
No, I didn't!

34:05.247 --> 34:07.214
You're the only one who knows the truth.

34:07.281 --> 34:09.514
The only one who knows where I am.

34:09.583 --> 34:10.716
I swear, I never talked to Kevin.

34:10.784 --> 34:12.016
I didn't even know he was out of jail.

34:12.085 --> 34:13.552
Then how did he find me?

34:13.620 --> 34:15.621
I don't know!

34:17.657 --> 34:18.790
Okay.

34:18.858 --> 34:21.525
And what does he want,
anyway? Why is he calling you?

34:21.592 --> 34:24.393
He didn't say.

34:24.460 --> 34:27.097
But he's threatening to tell
everyone the truth about me.

34:27.164 --> 34:30.806
It'll destroy my career.

34:33.146 --> 34:37.020
I'm about to get married, Ruth.

34:37.087 --> 34:39.222
To a really great guy.

34:39.289 --> 34:41.623
Well, there's gotta be something you can do.

34:41.690 --> 34:44.259
You can't let this son of a
bitch just ruin your life.

34:44.327 --> 34:48.762
I don't know what to do.

34:48.830 --> 34:53.132
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose everything.

34:55.701 --> 34:57.935
I gotta go, I'll call you later.

35:01.138 --> 35:02.739
Where you been?

35:02.806 --> 35:04.040
I've been trying to find you.

35:05.908 --> 35:07.442
Did you decrypt the file? No.

35:07.509 --> 35:08.609
I'm still working on it.

35:08.677 --> 35:10.545
I found something weird, though.

35:10.612 --> 35:14.615
Someone hacked into my station
and it came from inside CTU.

35:15.817 --> 35:17.417
What were they doing?

35:17.485 --> 35:19.453
Scanning the drone archives.

35:23.390 --> 35:26.525
Track it down, see who it was.

35:36.025 --> 35:36.959
And when you were in B'Dar,

35:37.027 --> 35:40.495
profiling President Hassan,
were you ever approached

35:40.563 --> 35:42.631
by anyone who was hostile to his regime?

35:42.698 --> 35:44.232
No. No one paid you?

35:44.300 --> 35:46.935
No. Pressured you into cooperating?

35:47.003 --> 35:48.437
I said no.

35:48.504 --> 35:51.073
So all you did was interview

35:51.140 --> 35:53.241
President Hassan, that's it?

35:53.309 --> 35:55.676
Yes, that's all.

35:59.013 --> 36:02.452
Her answer prompted a leve
l-five autonomic reaction.

36:02.519 --> 36:04.120
You're lying, Ms. Reed.

36:04.188 --> 36:05.588
I'm not. I...

36:05.656 --> 36:06.823
Tell me what really happened in B'Dar!

36:06.890 --> 36:09.259
How is it connected to
the assassination plot?

36:09.326 --> 36:11.294
I don't have anything to do

36:11.361 --> 36:14.296
with any plan to assassinate
President Hassan.

36:14.364 --> 36:15.798
My God, why would I?

36:15.865 --> 36:17.333
Your reasons are irrelevant.

36:17.400 --> 36:19.769
All I care about is stopping the assassin.

36:19.837 --> 36:21.470
So do I.

36:21.538 --> 36:23.874
So if someone really is
trying to kill Hassan,

36:23.941 --> 36:27.311
you need to stop wasting your
time on me and find them.

36:40.427 --> 36:42.262
Hey, Mike, what's going on?

36:42.329 --> 36:44.197
Maggie, I-I'm so sorry for dropping by

36:44.264 --> 36:45.597
without calling first.

36:45.665 --> 36:46.764
Mind if I come in?

36:46.832 --> 36:49.098
Sure, come on. Thanks.

36:49.166 --> 36:53.199
Did, uh, Jim leave for work yet?

36:53.267 --> 36:55.500
No, just got or. Oh, good.

36:55.566 --> 36:57.434
'Cause I need to ask him
something before he leaves.

36:57.501 --> 36:59.169
Kind of a favor. Okay.

36:59.236 --> 37:00.537
Hey, babe?

37:00.604 --> 37:02.305
Yeah? Mike Farmer's here.

37:02.373 --> 37:03.906
Says he needs to talk to you.

37:03.974 --> 37:05.475
Mikey! Hey!

37:05.542 --> 37:07.376
What are you doing here? You're not on shift

37:07.444 --> 37:10.146
till tomorrow. Yeah, that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

37:10.213 --> 37:11.480
All right, I'll be right down.

37:11.548 --> 37:12.815
All right, take your time.

37:12.883 --> 37:15.551
Want coffee? Sure.

37:15.619 --> 37:16.886
Come on. NEWSMAN:...
during President Taylor's

37:16.954 --> 37:18.654
press conference earlier this afternoon.

37:18.722 --> 37:22.558
I wouldn't want to speculate at this time,
Bob, but as you know,

37:22.626 --> 37:25.828
President Taylor's peace
negotiations with IRK president

37:25.896 --> 37:28.397
Omar Hassan are highly controversial...

37:28.465 --> 37:30.132
Sit down. Thanks.

37:30.200 --> 37:33.069
...and are causing much
political dissent both in...

37:33.136 --> 37:35.570
Did you hear anything
more about what happened

37:35.638 --> 37:36.738
at that press conference?

37:36.806 --> 37:39.408
No, only what they're saying on TV.

37:39.475 --> 37:42.811
I gotta tell you,
I'm so proud of you and Jim

37:42.879 --> 37:45.380
and all those boys down at the precinct.

37:45.448 --> 37:47.182
I mean, you're gonna be part of history.

37:47.250 --> 37:48.917
Nah, I don't know.

37:48.985 --> 37:51.252
We're just directing traffic, really.

37:51.320 --> 37:53.354
You're on the UN security detail.

37:53.422 --> 37:55.957
That's more than directing traffic.

37:56.025 --> 37:57.692
Ahh... Hell, you might even get on TV.

37:57.760 --> 37:59.694
<i>Wow, yeah, wouldn't that
be something.</i>

37:59.762 --> 38:01.029
Yeah, it would!

38:01.096 --> 38:02.530
Right.

38:09.939 --> 38:12.441
I need to speak with Mr. Hastings.

38:12.509 --> 38:16.211
Uh, we're in session. It's important.

38:16.279 --> 38:18.646
Excuse me, Mr. Hastings,
I have Dana Walsh out here.

38:18.714 --> 38:21.549
She says it's important.

38:21.617 --> 38:26.689
You're not leaving this room
until you tell me the truth.

38:26.757 --> 38:30.726
No matter how long it takes.

38:42.138 --> 38:43.305
I'm sorry to bother you, sir,

38:43.373 --> 38:44.740
but I didn't think that this could wait.

38:44.808 --> 38:45.908
What's this about?

38:45.976 --> 38:48.644
Jack Bauer.

38:56.653 --> 38:57.753
Come on...

39:28.710 --> 39:29.810
Yeah?

39:29.878 --> 39:32.045
I spoke with the dispatcher
at the cab company.

39:32.113 --> 39:34.414
His driver logged the dro
p-off at West 23rd Street

39:34.482 --> 39:36.183
at the northwest corner
of Broadway in Queens.

39:36.250 --> 39:37.351
Anything more specific?

39:37.418 --> 39:38.518
An apartment number, an address?

39:38.586 --> 39:40.854
Not from the dispatcher,
but I'll keep sifting

39:40.922 --> 39:42.989
through the aerial footage.
Okay, Broadway and West 23rd.

39:43.057 --> 39:45.125
I'll call you when I get there.

39:45.193 --> 39:46.693
Hands in the air! Now!

39:46.761 --> 39:48.728
Against the wall!

39:52.400 --> 39:53.533
Don't move.

40:01.608 --> 40:03.508
He had this, sir.

40:05.044 --> 40:07.378
We'll take it from here. AGENT: Stand down.

40:07.446 --> 40:10.514
I told you to leave this alone.
Chloe tracked the man

40:10.582 --> 40:12.984
in the surveillance photo
to a second location.

40:13.051 --> 40:14.952
We didn't think you'd follow
through with an investigation.

40:15.020 --> 40:17.187
So you had no choice except to
steal weapons from the armory.

40:17.255 --> 40:18.322
Would you have followed through

40:18.389 --> 40:19.489
with an investigation if I'd asked?

40:19.557 --> 40:20.623
I'm not debating this anymore.

40:20.691 --> 40:22.425
You shut down a lead before you could

40:22.493 --> 40:24.360
even assess whether it was good or bad.

40:24.427 --> 40:25.527
Take him to detention.

40:27.230 --> 40:28.963
Take him!

40:29.031 --> 40:30.365
Let's go.

40:30.432 --> 40:31.699
I'm sure President Taylor's
gonna be very interested

40:31.767 --> 40:33.700
to find out what happened to my informant

40:33.768 --> 40:35.869
when I tried to deliver
him to you. Excuse me?

40:35.936 --> 40:37.737
Cole tried to secure that
landing zone with more men,

40:37.804 --> 40:39.305
but instead you sent a drone,

40:39.373 --> 40:40.339
which failed to detect
the missile that killed

40:40.407 --> 40:41.974
my informant and two of your men.

40:42.041 --> 40:44.310
Cole hasn't said anything about it.

40:44.377 --> 40:47.481
And neither will I,
as long as you let me pursue this.

40:47.550 --> 40:49.251
So now you're blackmailing me?

40:49.318 --> 40:51.354
You forced my hand, now I'm forcing yours.

40:51.422 --> 40:53.190
You don't want to be doing this,
Bauer. No, I don't.

40:53.258 --> 40:55.128
I wanna be on a plane to
Los Angeles with my family.

40:55.195 --> 40:56.929
But you're not giving me another choice.

41:01.935 --> 41:03.736
You want to waste your time chasing ghosts?

41:03.804 --> 41:05.638
Knock yourself out.

41:05.706 --> 41:07.473
I've got to stop an assassination plot.

41:07.541 --> 41:08.641
Give him the bag.

41:10.010 --> 41:12.178
I need Chloe to run Ops.

41:12.246 --> 41:14.547
Fine, she's all yours.

41:14.614 --> 41:16.315
Thank you.

41:21.821 --> 41:24.556
Anything to what he's talking about?

41:24.624 --> 41:28.093
The only viable lead is sitting
in our interrogation room.

41:28.161 --> 41:31.129
And she's the only way we're
going to get to the assassin.

41:34.434 --> 41:35.934
What's going on, Mikey?

41:36.002 --> 41:40.004
Hey, listen, um, something came up.

41:40.072 --> 41:41.439
I can't make my shift tomorrow.

41:41.507 --> 41:43.374
So, I was wondering if we could swap.

41:43.442 --> 41:44.976
Oh, I'd be happy to, except Maggie and me

41:45.044 --> 41:46.311
have a meeting with Sean's teacher tomorrow.

41:46.378 --> 41:47.478
She said he's

41:47.546 --> 41:50.248
acting out in class, but I don't believe it.

41:50.316 --> 41:52.684
Jim keeps making excuses for him,
but if he needs help,

41:52.751 --> 41:54.218
I want to give it to him.

41:54.286 --> 41:57.855
Where is he? He's at his grandma's tonight.

41:57.923 --> 42:00.758
I'm not making excuses.

42:00.826 --> 42:03.895
So, what are you saying?

42:03.962 --> 42:06.163
You can't trade shifts with me?

42:06.231 --> 42:08.465
This is kind of important, so I'm sorry.

42:08.533 --> 42:12.035
Yeah.

42:13.370 --> 42:14.737
Me, too.

42:14.804 --> 42:16.772
Whoa, Mikey, what...

42:16.840 --> 42:20.142
Maggie, I want you to sit down.

42:20.210 --> 42:25.348
Jim, there's a roll of tape

42:25.416 --> 42:26.683
in my bag.

42:26.750 --> 42:30.186
Tear off a strip and put
it over Maggie's mouth.

42:32.356 --> 42:34.490
Do it.

42:55.240 --> 42:57.808
I'm sorry, baby. Oh, my God.

42:59.944 --> 43:03.679
Now, pick up the phone,
call Captain Ravello.

43:03.747 --> 43:05.048
Tell him you're sick

43:05.116 --> 43:07.019
and I'm filling in for you.

43:07.086 --> 43:09.188
Now, listen, you son of a bitch,
there's no way...

43:09.255 --> 43:11.791
Oh! Oh, what's the matter with you?!

43:11.859 --> 43:13.360
What are you doing?!

43:13.427 --> 43:16.063
Next time, I won't miss the bone.

43:18.767 --> 43:20.969
Make the call.

43:21.037 --> 43:22.604
All right.

43:22.672 --> 43:23.972
All right, I'll call.

43:24.040 --> 43:25.941
Please, just leave my wife alone, all right?
