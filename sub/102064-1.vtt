M_I_SForEver

00:23.525 --> 00:24.759
Okay.

00:32.165 --> 00:33.668
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

00:34.736 --> 00:35.770
I'm ready.

00:37.672 --> 00:39.206
All right, let's do it.

00:44.278 --> 00:45.747
<i>You sure you're okay?</i>

00:46.280 --> 00:49.517
<i>Yeah, just...</i>

00:49.551 --> 00:51.619
They brought me cupcakes
at work today.

00:51.653 --> 00:56.089
Oh, God.
Sorry to hear that.

00:56.123 --> 00:57.725
I don't know how they
knew it was my birthday,

00:57.759 --> 01:00.427
they must have looked
on my W-2 or something,

01:00.460 --> 01:01.696
which should be illegal.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.865
Come on,
they're tryin' to be nice.

01:03.898 --> 01:06.166
I just don't want it
to be a big deal.

01:08.736 --> 01:11.138
Carrie and John don't know,
do they?

01:11.171 --> 01:12.640
That it's my birthday?

01:12.674 --> 01:14.676
- No.
- I don't know. I don't know.

01:14.709 --> 01:16.209
- Well...
- Can you not tell her,

01:16.243 --> 01:18.846
'cause she makes a big thing
out of everything.

01:20.548 --> 01:21.749
Right.

01:22.717 --> 01:24.752
I just wanna like

01:24.786 --> 01:27.622
play <i>Catan,</i> and slam some wine,

01:27.655 --> 01:30.658
and order some Thai food,
and that's it.

01:35.362 --> 01:36.363
What?

01:39.433 --> 01:41.234
I don't know
if I should tell you.

01:41.769 --> 01:42.804
She knows?

01:44.271 --> 01:47.441
She knows. Fuck!

01:47.474 --> 01:51.579
Okay, there might be
a few more, um...

01:53.413 --> 01:57.719
people there than you were...
expecting.

01:57.752 --> 01:59.621
It's kind of like a, um...

02:01.556 --> 02:03.190
surprise party for you.

02:04.424 --> 02:05.425
It's a what?

02:06.126 --> 02:07.762
- Dude.
- Oh, God.

02:10.664 --> 02:12.533
What the hell?

02:14.368 --> 02:16.738
I'm sorry,
I thought you'd be excited.

02:16.771 --> 02:19.239
Why would I be...

02:19.272 --> 02:21.542
No, I... No.

02:21.576 --> 02:25.379
Look, I'm sorry.
It was a stupid idea and I am sorry.

02:25.947 --> 02:28.415
Uh, no, no, I...

02:28.448 --> 02:31.719
I've just been panicky
all day.

02:31.753 --> 02:33.821
Nena, I don't want to
stress you out. I just...

02:33.855 --> 02:36.256
I don't know,
I thought it would be fun.

02:36.289 --> 02:40.227
But, baby,
I hate surprise parties.

02:41.763 --> 02:43.430
Can I ask you something?

02:43.463 --> 02:45.232
Has anybody
ever thrown you one?

02:47.334 --> 02:48.703
No.

02:48.736 --> 02:51.304
So, how do you know?

02:57.879 --> 02:59.647
Surprise!

03:00.915 --> 03:02.382
Hi.

03:07.755 --> 03:10.390
Hey, are you sure
everything's okay?

03:10.424 --> 03:12.627
No, it's good.
Thank you, really.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.696
I just get... You know?

03:14.729 --> 03:17.565
I've been planning this like
almost as long as our wedding,

03:17.598 --> 03:20.902
and it was Drew's idea, but you
know, I just kind of rolled with it.

03:20.935 --> 03:23.538
You guys have been so good
to us since we moved here,

03:23.571 --> 03:25.506
and it's such a big moment
in your life!

03:25.540 --> 03:28.375
Like you turned 30!
Like what? It's crazy.

03:28.408 --> 03:30.343
And like I don't even...
I can't even imagine

03:30.377 --> 03:31.344
what turning 30 would be like.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.480
That's such a foreign
concept to me, you know?

03:33.514 --> 03:35.348
Like, your credit score's
probably, like, perfect.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.652
I don't even know. The other day,
I went to put air in my tires,

03:37.685 --> 03:39.721
and I was like, I don't even know how
I'm freaking gonna do this right now,

03:39.754 --> 03:41.823
and I used to call my mom all the
time, but now I can call you,

03:41.856 --> 03:43.457
'cause you're the
real grown-up in my life.

03:43.490 --> 03:45.660
Your life is like so set,
like it's so good,

03:45.693 --> 03:47.327
you're like so set,
it's so great.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.564
And we have chips and dip,
and onion dip,

03:49.597 --> 03:52.332
and we have, uh...
There's broccoli and edamame,

03:52.365 --> 03:54.401
but not cauliflower,
'cause I know you don't like cauliflower,

03:54.434 --> 03:56.436
but, uh, there's hummus,
but I...

03:56.470 --> 03:58.005
Drew didn't know
what kind of hummus you liked,

03:58.039 --> 03:59.807
so I just...
I just picked one, so...

04:00.373 --> 04:02.944
What hummus do you like?

04:02.977 --> 04:06.246
Oh, uh, the Mediterranean
one from TJ's with pine nuts.

04:08.950 --> 04:13.521
Damn it, uh...
we got sun-dried tomato.

04:13.554 --> 04:15.656
Didn't I tell you
to get Mediterranean?

04:17.058 --> 04:19.026
I have no idea.

04:19.060 --> 04:20.595
Uh, it's fine, Carrie.

04:20.628 --> 04:21.829
Really, thank you.

04:22.997 --> 04:24.732
Oh, honey, do you wanna
tell them?

04:26.033 --> 04:27.735
- Tell them what?
- Yeah, tell us what?

04:28.636 --> 04:31.639
Oh, we goin' campin'.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.641
- You two should come.
- Yeah, totally.

04:33.674 --> 04:37.310
Uh, hey, who is that?
Has she hung out with us before?

04:37.344 --> 04:41.381
Oh, that's Olivia. She just started
working at the coffee shop with me.

04:41.414 --> 04:42.784
She looks familiar,
though.

04:42.817 --> 04:44.484
She used to be a model.

04:46.020 --> 04:48.455
In France, bro.

04:50.892 --> 04:52.325
I don't know
what that means.

05:03.104 --> 05:04.539
Hey.

05:04.572 --> 05:05.573
Hey.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.744
- Could I bum one?
- Totally.

05:09.777 --> 05:10.978
Thank you.

05:14.949 --> 05:16.383
It's Nena, right?

05:17.384 --> 05:18.385
Yeah.

05:20.154 --> 05:21.354
Olivia?

05:22.690 --> 05:24.959
- How do you know?
- Carrie, she told me.

05:27.061 --> 05:28.763
She talks
about you a lot at work, too.

05:28.796 --> 05:30.698
My friend Nena this,
my friend Nena that.

05:31.566 --> 05:33.968
- Oh, God.
- No, it's sweet.

05:34.535 --> 05:36.103
Yeah, no, I love Carrie.

05:36.137 --> 05:38.139
I mean, she invited all
these people here

05:38.172 --> 05:40.741
and I don't know half of them, so...

05:47.447 --> 05:48.683
I love these mountains.

05:49.817 --> 05:51.118
They're not bad.

05:51.152 --> 05:52.553
I used to run up them.

05:52.987 --> 05:54.487
You ran up those?

05:55.156 --> 05:57.091
In my prime.

05:57.124 --> 05:58.526
Why'd you stop?

06:00.194 --> 06:02.930
I always said that I would
quit for good when I turned 30.

06:04.198 --> 06:05.465
Hm.

06:09.170 --> 06:11.371
So you're from France?

06:12.640 --> 06:14.407
No.

06:14.441 --> 06:19.647
Oh, Carrie and John,
they said you're a model in France.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.550
I was like kind of sort of
actress in New York,

06:22.583 --> 06:24.986
and yeah, I just fell into it.

06:25.019 --> 06:26.754
But I'm from here originally.

06:27.755 --> 06:29.156
What are you doing now?

06:29.190 --> 06:31.692
I'm workin' at the coffee shop
with Carrie.

06:33.527 --> 06:36.530
Uh, no, I know, but like
what are you doing?

06:38.799 --> 06:42.937
I'm, um, foaming milk and
cream-cheesing bagels.

06:42.970 --> 06:46.540
That was such an LA question, I am so sorry.

06:46.574 --> 06:48.142
- It's okay.
- Fuck.

06:48.175 --> 06:50.845
I guess I'm past my prime, too.

06:50.878 --> 06:53.080
- How old are you?
- Twenty-five.

06:53.114 --> 06:55.049
Yeah, fuck off.

06:55.082 --> 06:57.852
I don't feel bad about asking
my question anymore.

06:57.885 --> 07:00.054
Ooh, come on,
older women are sexy.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.856
Oh, Jesus Christ.

07:05.593 --> 07:06.594
So what now?

07:08.629 --> 07:11.933
Turning 30,
does it... feel different?

07:13.901 --> 07:15.903
Um, I don't know.

07:18.606 --> 07:23.544
Like I guess I hit all the marks
I'm supposed to hit in my 20s.

07:23.577 --> 07:27.782
Married, employed,
I like my apartment,

07:27.815 --> 07:31.786
I'm probably not gonna die poor and
lonely, so yeah, I'm doing great.

07:31.819 --> 07:33.921
Yeah, but I didn't ask
if you were doing great.

07:33.955 --> 07:35.623
I asked if you felt different.

07:37.024 --> 07:39.226
Right. Um...

07:42.229 --> 07:44.632
no, not really.

07:50.004 --> 07:51.005
Can I have another one?

07:52.273 --> 07:53.641
Yeah.

08:13.260 --> 08:16.197
Thank you for throwing
my surprise party, baby.

08:16.230 --> 08:19.000
I'm sorry that
you didn't have a good time.

08:20.001 --> 08:21.002
No, I did.

08:24.638 --> 08:25.940
- I did.
- Really?

08:26.340 --> 08:27.608
Yeah.

08:29.710 --> 08:32.046
I probably wouldn't leave the
house if it wasn't for you.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.960
Okay.

08:49.330 --> 08:50.831
<i>I'm just thinkin', like,</i>

08:50.865 --> 08:53.134
<i>I'm getting too old
to be so scared of new things.</i>

08:54.168 --> 08:55.970
I just wanna say "yes"
to things.

08:57.605 --> 08:58.606
Really?

08:59.907 --> 09:01.075
Yeah, really.

09:01.976 --> 09:03.778
Really, really.

09:03.811 --> 09:06.680
So that's why you said
"yes" to camping this weekend.

09:07.848 --> 09:10.151
I said "yes" to what?

09:10.184 --> 09:14.922
Uh, you seemed a little...
I don't know, distracted maybe.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.224
Oh.

09:18.325 --> 09:20.995
- So you want me to cancel?
- No.

09:22.196 --> 09:23.831
You know what?
No, let's do it.

09:23.864 --> 09:24.865
Really?

09:26.233 --> 09:27.234
Yeah.

09:29.670 --> 09:30.871
I mean...

09:33.407 --> 09:35.676
Fuck it. I can camp.

09:36.844 --> 09:37.978
All right.

09:38.012 --> 09:40.781
Fuck yeah. I mean, I wanna do
new stuff all the time.

09:40.815 --> 09:41.916
Total overhaul.

09:41.949 --> 09:44.151
Oh my God, I am so into
this right now. I love this.

09:45.953 --> 09:49.990
So then, what about the thing
we talked about the other week?

09:50.024 --> 09:52.760
- What thing?
- You know, the thing with the heels?

09:53.360 --> 09:55.129
What thing with the heels?

09:55.162 --> 09:57.765
You don't remember?
Well, I would lie on the floor

09:57.798 --> 09:59.066
and then you would...

09:59.100 --> 10:00.768
- Oh.
- Yeah.

10:00.801 --> 10:03.370
I thought
you were kidding about that.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.874
- Oh, no. Yeah, I was.
- You were what?

10:06.907 --> 10:09.043
- Are you serious?
- I was kidding. I mean, you know?

10:11.345 --> 10:13.347
Do... do you really want me
to do that to you?

10:15.850 --> 10:17.318
I don't want to if you
don't want to.

10:18.419 --> 10:19.653
Uh...

10:21.088 --> 10:22.756
Right now,
I just wanna go to bed.

10:23.157 --> 10:24.225
Okay, baby.

10:34.702 --> 10:37.204
Y <i>ou know,
my boss was surprisingly cool</i>

10:37.238 --> 10:40.708
with me taking a half day.
I should do this more often.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.009
You know what?
Me, too.

10:42.042 --> 10:45.312
Baby, you work from home,
your whole life is a half day.

10:50.417 --> 10:51.418
Sorry.

11:13.474 --> 11:15.042
Yay, you made it!

11:15.075 --> 11:16.744
Hi.

11:16.777 --> 11:17.646
- What's up, man?
- What's up, bro?

11:17.678 --> 11:19.079
- How you doin'?
- Hello.

11:19.113 --> 11:21.916
- How are you doin'?
- Hi, there.

11:21.949 --> 11:23.751
- We made it.
- Yeah!

11:23.784 --> 11:25.920
- How was the drive, bro?
- Not bad, yeah.

11:25.953 --> 11:30.124
Question, um, you guys have
an extra tent?

11:30.157 --> 11:32.126
- Why?
- Olivia forgot to bring one.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.261
- What?
- Hey.

11:46.541 --> 11:49.443
And she is in all green,
like a leaf.

11:50.277 --> 11:51.312
The Joker.

11:51.345 --> 11:52.379
I know, I know.

11:52.413 --> 11:53.881
- But it's a she.
- Poison Ivy.

11:53.914 --> 11:57.184
Ooh, this guy, he's like
my one pass.

11:57.218 --> 11:59.220
- Anderson Cooper, yeah.
- Yeah.

11:59.253 --> 12:01.355
Newspaper publisher,
fictional,

12:01.388 --> 12:02.890
greatest movie of all time.

12:02.923 --> 12:05.226
Rosebud.

12:05.259 --> 12:07.228
- Citizen what?
- <i>Citizen Kane!</i>

12:07.261 --> 12:09.063
- But what's the name?
- Oh. Oh, God.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.298
Oh, shit, bro.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.101
- Indiana Jones?
- No.

12:14.134 --> 12:16.971
- Hey. Hey, hey!
- You guys, you are the most...

12:17.004 --> 12:18.405
- <i>Degrassi.</i>
- Oh.

12:18.439 --> 12:20.474
<i>Degrassi.</i>
Neil deGrasse Tyson.

12:20.508 --> 12:22.243
- What the fuck!
- Drake?

12:22.276 --> 12:23.477
- Yes!
- Yes!

12:32.019 --> 12:33.555
Hey, can I ask you guys
a question?

12:33.588 --> 12:38.560
Um, if we were to get
married here or like in LA, um,

12:38.593 --> 12:41.862
would you be a part
of the wedding party?

12:41.895 --> 12:44.532
Oh, but I thought you were
getting married in Colorado.

12:44.566 --> 12:48.503
Um, no, I just...
I got in this big fight with my parents,

12:48.536 --> 12:50.170
'cause they don't think
that we're like ready

12:50.204 --> 12:51.606
or financially stable
or whatever, you know?

12:51.640 --> 12:54.875
They give like four or five bullshit reasons, you know?

12:54.908 --> 12:56.310
So they're not gonna pay
for it, even though,

12:56.343 --> 12:58.212
they paid for both my
asshole sisters' weddings

12:58.245 --> 12:59.179
and one of them
is already divorced,

12:59.213 --> 13:01.549
but, you know,
I'm the unstable one, so...

13:01.583 --> 13:03.817
I'm sorry that sucks.

13:03.851 --> 13:06.854
Yeah. But it's okay,
'cause we're gonna save up

13:06.887 --> 13:09.123
and we're gonna pay
for it ourselves,

13:09.156 --> 13:11.025
and we're gonna have it here,

13:11.058 --> 13:13.427
and we're gonna have a kick-ass
wedding with our LA family.

13:13.460 --> 13:16.030
Fuck, yeah. Fuck, yeah.

13:16.063 --> 13:17.197
And we already
picked out a date.

13:19.133 --> 13:20.502
October 22nd.

13:22.936 --> 13:26.373
That's... our wedding
anniversary.

13:26.407 --> 13:30.010
Yeah, we're gonna be like...
like wedding sisters,

13:30.044 --> 13:33.247
you know, and we can, uh, go on like
double dates on the anniversaries.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.448
Isn't that amazing?

13:38.385 --> 13:39.521
That's so fun.

13:41.388 --> 13:44.358
Yeah. I know. Oh my God,
I'm so glad you're excited.

13:47.595 --> 13:49.129
Your dad's a piece of shit.

13:50.632 --> 13:51.899
He's...
he's not a piece of shit.

13:51.932 --> 13:56.003
All right, come on. He's...
he's definitely a piece of shit.

14:00.341 --> 14:02.309
Oh, God.

14:04.244 --> 14:07.348
Hey, damn it, John. All right.
Every time. All right, come on.

14:07.381 --> 14:09.216
Come on, honey, let's go.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.317
- Come on.
- Okay, buddy.

14:12.486 --> 14:15.155
- There you go.
- Drew, why don't you like me?

14:15.189 --> 14:16.990
What are you talkin' about?
You're my guy.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.993
- You're just saying that.
- No.

14:22.262 --> 14:23.565
Drew seems really sweet.

14:23.598 --> 14:26.400
Yeah, he is the best.

14:26.433 --> 14:29.069
He seems like
he really takes care of you.

14:29.103 --> 14:32.206
Hm. You know that
feeling when you're not sure

14:32.239 --> 14:34.942
whether or not your sunglasses
are still on the top of your head?

14:36.611 --> 14:40.381
That's my whole life and...

14:40.414 --> 14:43.484
But I can always count on Drew to
tell me if they're there or not.

14:45.419 --> 14:49.189
Scary having to depend on someone
or have them depend on you.

14:50.157 --> 14:51.992
It is.

14:52.025 --> 14:54.128
Like sometimes
when we're going to sleep,

14:54.161 --> 14:58.165
I just look at him and I think,
"Holy shit, I am with him."

14:58.198 --> 15:00.602
I mean I want to be,
I love him, but it's like,

15:00.635 --> 15:02.604
fuck, this is really happening,

15:02.637 --> 15:06.373
and it's overwhelming, and I feel like
I'm looking down from a tightrope,

15:06.407 --> 15:08.510
and I thought that feeling might
change once we got married,

15:08.543 --> 15:11.111
but it's, uh...

15:12.479 --> 15:13.947
Never mind, uh...

15:17.017 --> 15:19.286
I get anxious
and I don't know why.

15:21.021 --> 15:23.056
It's like it's waiting
for me around the corner

15:23.090 --> 15:24.925
and I just don't know when
it's gonna pop out.

15:29.263 --> 15:30.330
What?

15:31.465 --> 15:32.534
Nothing.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.739
What?

15:37.772 --> 15:40.307
Carrie invited me
on this camping trip

15:40.340 --> 15:42.510
every day at work
for the past week.

15:43.745 --> 15:45.479
When she said you were going,

15:47.181 --> 15:48.550
I just said, "Yeah, sure."

15:53.053 --> 15:55.690
What? Uh, um...

15:55.956 --> 15:57.157
Why?

15:57.559 --> 15:58.959
I don't know.

16:01.161 --> 16:04.532
I think maybe it was when I
talked to you at your birthday,

16:06.366 --> 16:07.602
you just seemed so wound up,

16:09.102 --> 16:11.739
and I guess maybe that
there was...

16:11.773 --> 16:16.143
part of me that wanted
to... unwind you.

16:18.613 --> 16:20.013
I'm really not sure.

16:34.361 --> 16:35.763
Oh my gosh, it's so cold.

16:35.797 --> 16:38.432
We just gotta get some
body heat goin'.

16:38.465 --> 16:39.534
Okay, Nena, I'm dying,

16:39.567 --> 16:41.235
- so you're gonna have to get in here.
- Okay.

16:44.706 --> 16:46.741
This is gonna
sound weird,

16:46.774 --> 16:49.042
but your hair smells
really good.

16:51.144 --> 16:54.616
Well, thank you.

17:00.788 --> 17:03.390
Mom and dad are fighting
again, you guys.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.425
I know,
they've gotten so bad.

17:05.459 --> 17:08.295
Eh, they were always
kinda bad.

17:08.328 --> 17:10.698
Well, I'm sure once they're
married everything will be fine.

17:10.732 --> 17:12.199
I mean,
that's how it works, right?

17:12.232 --> 17:13.568
Oh, absolutely.

17:13.601 --> 17:16.270
We never fight. Not really.

17:16.303 --> 17:18.472
Oh, come on,
seriously never?

17:18.506 --> 17:20.541
Well, Drew won't fight with me.

17:22.342 --> 17:24.646
Well, I'm a lover,
not a fighter. What can I say?

17:24.679 --> 17:26.046
Ooh, la, la.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.256
Thanks for letting me
crash with you guys.

17:37.725 --> 17:38.726
Yeah.

17:58.846 --> 18:00.447
Oh shit, man.

18:01.148 --> 18:02.282
Oh my God.

18:04.686 --> 18:06.153
Wow.

20:29.630 --> 20:31.431
I have to talk to you
about something.

20:35.803 --> 20:36.971
Wanna get Thai food?

20:49.449 --> 20:50.885
Just tell me...

20:52.887 --> 20:54.421
tell me how you're feeling.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.659
I... think...

20:59.594 --> 21:04.632
that I need to know how
you're feeling,

21:04.665 --> 21:08.035
so I can decide
how I'm feeling.

21:10.437 --> 21:11.873
I feel uneasy.

21:13.473 --> 21:14.675
Because she kissed you?

21:15.843 --> 21:17.310
I don't think that's it.

21:20.014 --> 21:21.048
Okay.

21:22.517 --> 21:25.953
Because you... liked it?

21:27.622 --> 21:28.623
Maybe.

21:30.992 --> 21:34.929
And that's makin' you uneasy,
because it's new or...

21:34.962 --> 21:37.064
Because we're married.

21:37.098 --> 21:39.934
I'm only supposed to love you,
that is supposed to be enough.

21:39.967 --> 21:42.302
- But enough what?
- I don't know.

21:42.970 --> 21:44.939
And yeah, yes, I liked it.

21:46.574 --> 21:49.442
I liked it. I have barely
ever even been with a girl,

21:50.077 --> 21:51.846
but I liked it.

21:53.446 --> 21:54.649
You kissed a girl?

21:56.383 --> 21:58.085
- Yeah.
- And you liked it?

22:00.688 --> 22:03.057
I feel shitty, I feel like
a shit person.

22:03.090 --> 22:04.125
Why?

22:04.158 --> 22:05.960
Because...

22:07.628 --> 22:12.567
I don't really feel...
anything.

22:12.600 --> 22:15.736
Yeah, I mean,
I feel bad that you feel bad.

22:17.572 --> 22:19.907
And... and that isn't
weird to you

22:19.941 --> 22:23.044
that you don't feel
betrayed or anything?

22:23.077 --> 22:24.512
I mean, do you want me to?

22:24.545 --> 22:27.048
Goddammit, no!
I just want something.

22:27.081 --> 22:28.549
What then? What?
What do you want?

22:28.583 --> 22:29.851
You want me
to take my shirt off?

22:29.884 --> 22:31.652
You want me throw you against the
wall, piss on the floor?

22:31.686 --> 22:33.921
I just want you to engage
with this emotionally

22:33.955 --> 22:36.456
and not like it's some
fucking puzzle to solve.

22:36.489 --> 22:39.093
I want you to have an opinion
at least.

22:39.126 --> 22:40.995
I... I need you to try.

22:41.028 --> 22:45.633
I need you to tell me,
your wife, how you really feel.

22:54.041 --> 22:55.475
Horny.

22:58.813 --> 23:01.015
Okay, horny.

23:01.048 --> 23:02.550
- Horny.
- Okay.

23:04.952 --> 23:08.488
Look... we're together
forever, right?

23:09.857 --> 23:11.893
We signed the thing,
that's taken care of.

23:12.994 --> 23:14.394
We're solid.

23:16.697 --> 23:17.765
We're solid, right?

23:20.601 --> 23:23.070
I mean of course, yeah,

23:24.639 --> 23:27.742
but what if this...
It changes us?

23:29.110 --> 23:31.178
If something were to happen,

23:32.580 --> 23:34.782
is it worth risking
what we have?

23:36.250 --> 23:37.952
Say that we don't see her again

23:40.054 --> 23:46.761
and us, this...
We just stay exactly the same.

23:49.096 --> 23:50.631
Is that really what you want?

25:22.289 --> 25:23.724
It's almost 9:00.

25:25.359 --> 25:26.761
I didn't shave my pussy.

25:27.628 --> 25:29.330
Do you think I should
shave my pussy?

25:29.363 --> 25:31.999
Pussy's fine, your pussy's
great, your pussy is dynamite.

25:32.033 --> 25:34.769
I washed it,
I just didn't shave it.

25:36.103 --> 25:37.238
Not that anything's
gonna happen.

25:37.271 --> 25:41.175
I just wonder if I feel
more confident if... You know?

25:42.143 --> 25:43.644
Sure, if that's what you want.

25:45.746 --> 25:47.148
Well, should I or shouldn't I?

25:51.085 --> 25:52.920
It's whatever you want,
you know?

25:59.326 --> 26:00.995
You know, though, I have
been noticing in porn

26:01.028 --> 26:03.764
that the shaved look is
kind of goin' out of fashion.

26:03.798 --> 26:05.332
- You would know.
- Groomed for sure,

26:05.366 --> 26:07.902
but the middle-school look
is a little '90s.

26:09.837 --> 26:12.073
Nothing is gonna
happen anyways.

26:12.106 --> 26:13.841
I don't know why
I'm acting like this.

26:17.278 --> 26:20.781
You're right, okay?
We're gonna take it slow

26:20.815 --> 26:23.884
and we're just gonna
hang out. Okay?

26:27.221 --> 26:29.223
- You look really nice.
- Yeah?

26:29.256 --> 26:31.058
Hm. Very handsome.

26:31.092 --> 26:33.360
- You clean up good.
- Thank you, baby.

26:33.394 --> 26:35.162
Are you sure
that you're okay?

26:40.835 --> 26:41.836
Hey, guys.

26:44.305 --> 26:47.775
I think I'm gonna have to
take a lift home at this point.

26:47.808 --> 26:50.744
- What part of town are you in?
- Well, it's like mid-city.

26:50.778 --> 26:55.649
I sleep on a couch in a little
house I share with my brother.

26:55.683 --> 26:56.984
And you get along with him?

26:57.017 --> 27:00.754
It's more like there's just a
lot of personality for one space.

27:00.788 --> 27:02.790
And then, plus,
he has this rotating cast

27:02.823 --> 27:04.291
of boyfriends,
and ex-boyfriends,

27:04.325 --> 27:07.027
and some fuck buddies,
and just drama.

27:07.061 --> 27:10.664
- But at least, you're getting the full LA experience?
- I guess.

27:10.698 --> 27:13.300
I mean we've been together
for what? Six years now?

27:13.334 --> 27:15.769
- Six years.
- Right, just the two of us, you know?

27:15.803 --> 27:17.872
So we never got
that whole bohemian phase

27:17.905 --> 27:20.274
that everyone else
in this town seems to get.

27:20.307 --> 27:21.809
Well, it's overrated.

27:21.842 --> 27:24.845
I mean, most of them are just trust-fund
babies posing as starving artists

27:24.879 --> 27:27.915
and the rest of them are
actually starving.

27:27.948 --> 27:29.350
Which one are you?

27:29.383 --> 27:31.418
Now? Oh, now, I'm starving.

27:32.186 --> 27:33.220
And in Paris?

27:36.857 --> 27:38.993
You guys really wanna
hear about Paris?

27:39.026 --> 27:41.328
Uh, it's very cliche, just...

27:41.362 --> 27:43.864
Yeah, 'cause we meet so many French
models, we're really getting sick of it.

27:48.802 --> 27:50.137
Come on, tell us about it.

27:52.173 --> 27:55.943
A photographer that I knew
from New York,

27:55.976 --> 27:59.914
Lionel, was in Paris
shooting a series for Clinique,

27:59.947 --> 28:01.415
and he asked me to come
check it out,

28:01.448 --> 28:03.717
and I ended up doing some
test shoots for him,

28:03.751 --> 28:06.287
and they loved it,
so he started getting work all over town.

28:06.320 --> 28:07.321
Hm.

28:08.856 --> 28:09.857
And those first few months

28:09.890 --> 28:13.227
were the most romantic period
of my whole life.

28:13.260 --> 28:19.266
Just, like, the city, and the
attitude, the coke, the molly.

28:19.300 --> 28:21.402
See, I warned you this
would be a cliche.

28:22.604 --> 28:25.940
I know this sounds stupid,
because it is just modeling,

28:25.973 --> 28:30.244
but the work was really
gratifying and the drugs helped,

28:30.277 --> 28:34.381
but really it was the fact
that I was in love.

28:34.415 --> 28:37.451
You know, it gave me confidence like
I could try anything with Lionel.

28:44.091 --> 28:45.092
What happened?

28:46.827 --> 28:48.796
Well, I started getting
bigger offers

28:48.829 --> 28:51.498
from companies who wanted
to use their own photographers

28:51.533 --> 28:54.201
and Lionel was...

28:54.235 --> 28:57.905
He was extremely jealous,
and possessive,

28:57.938 --> 28:59.240
which made it
really hard to live with.

29:00.841 --> 29:02.510
And of course, every time
I left the house,

29:02.544 --> 29:05.145
he was convinced that I was
sleeping with the whole city, so...

29:08.583 --> 29:11.151
You know, when things
just start getting messy,

29:12.319 --> 29:14.188
it's like, um,

29:14.221 --> 29:16.857
fights, and the drugs,
I don't know...

29:17.925 --> 29:19.260
Blah, blah.

29:21.529 --> 29:25.533
And then one day, I came home after
doing a shoot with another photographer

29:26.601 --> 29:31.805
and I found him dead
in the bathroom.

29:31.839 --> 29:35.476
Punch line though is that after he
killed himself, my offers tripled.

29:35.510 --> 29:37.378
I mean it was just disgusting.

29:37.411 --> 29:40.881
So um, yeah,
just fucked off back to LA.

29:46.020 --> 29:48.389
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to make you cry.

29:48.422 --> 29:51.258
Oh, no. I'm sorry we made you
talk about it.

29:51.292 --> 29:52.326
No, it's fine.

29:55.362 --> 29:57.998
That... that point in my life
I felt like

29:58.032 --> 30:02.537
I was being driven
by this really powerful thing.

30:03.605 --> 30:06.473
I just felt like
I was so filled up,

30:06.508 --> 30:08.175
I just felt like
I was bursting,

30:08.208 --> 30:11.011
and every instinct I had
was just so clean,

30:11.045 --> 30:13.047
and so clear, and, um...

30:15.550 --> 30:18.986
I think I'm just really scared that I
won't be able to get that feeling back.

30:37.971 --> 30:39.473
I'm sorry.

32:50.437 --> 32:53.106
Oh, you know what?
This is what it probably is.

32:53.140 --> 32:56.076
She works at a coffee shop, right?
Coffee shops open early.

32:57.344 --> 32:58.345
4:00 in the morning?

33:00.481 --> 33:01.482
I don't know.

33:04.586 --> 33:06.186
Do you think it's
something we did?

33:07.287 --> 33:10.057
Or she felt weird or...

33:11.659 --> 33:13.360
- we took advantage of her?
- No.

33:13.393 --> 33:15.429
- She was upset.
- No, look,

33:15.462 --> 33:17.397
it was a great time, right?
We all had a great time.

33:17.799 --> 33:20.133
Yeah... I guess.

33:21.836 --> 33:23.036
I think I did.

33:23.370 --> 33:24.371
You think?

33:24.839 --> 33:26.039
I don't know.

33:27.307 --> 33:28.676
I don't know.

33:28.710 --> 33:30.512
Well, from where
I was sitting,

33:30.545 --> 33:32.814
it looked like
you were having an exorcism,

33:32.847 --> 33:34.782
to be completely honest
with you.

33:34.816 --> 33:36.584
So why do I feel
like shit right now?

33:36.618 --> 33:39.721
Dopamine drop off,
hangover, Catholic upbringing.

33:39.754 --> 33:41.556
Do you think she just wanted
a one-night stand?

33:42.590 --> 33:45.660
What if we take this experience

33:45.693 --> 33:48.530
and now that we know that we're into
it, we can find other people.

33:49.296 --> 33:50.565
How?

33:50.598 --> 33:53.133
You know, things have changed
a lot since we started dating.

33:53.166 --> 33:55.335
- Kids today, they...
- "Kids today", you say that now?

33:55.369 --> 33:56.470
Yeah, kids today,

33:56.504 --> 33:58.573
they just...
they clickety-clack on their phones

33:58.606 --> 34:00.608
and boom, freaky sex town.

34:00.642 --> 34:02.677
It's honestly, it's like
ordering Papa John's.

34:27.534 --> 34:28.536
Hi, thank you.

34:32.706 --> 34:34.141
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:36.543 --> 34:38.846
Can I get you some coffee?

34:38.880 --> 34:42.550
No, I just wanted to, uh,
come by and say hi.

34:42.583 --> 34:44.284
And make sure
you were doin' okay.

34:44.318 --> 34:47.120
Yeah, that's sweet.
I'm doing good.

34:47.154 --> 34:48.388
- What about you guys?
- Good.

34:49.824 --> 34:52.259
You left before we could...

34:52.292 --> 34:54.762
Oh, hey, Drew! Give me a second,
I have to use the restroom.

34:56.797 --> 34:59.634
Look, I just wanted to say that we
had a really good time last night.

34:59.667 --> 35:01.168
Yeah, I... I did, too.

35:02.937 --> 35:05.305
And we really like
hangin' out with you.

35:05.339 --> 35:06.708
I really like you guys, too.

35:08.810 --> 35:12.880
Nena really likes you,
you know?

35:14.616 --> 35:17.518
I just don't wanna make things
complicated, you know?

35:17.552 --> 35:19.520
For you guys or for me.

35:19.554 --> 35:21.623
I get it. I get it.

35:21.656 --> 35:25.192
I mean, last night was amazing,
I mean, really amazing,

35:25.225 --> 35:27.528
but have you guys
actually thought this through?

35:27.562 --> 35:30.898
I mean, what would be the best
possible outcome if we were to...

35:31.933 --> 35:33.266
Oh, I don't know.

35:33.300 --> 35:35.369
Look, I could come up with

35:35.402 --> 35:37.872
a whole list of
end-game scenarios

35:37.905 --> 35:39.941
for how this is gonna play out,

35:39.974 --> 35:43.210
but I'm really tryin' hard
not to do that

35:43.243 --> 35:44.846
with stuff like this, you know?

35:46.814 --> 35:49.550
All I know is, I've never seen
her like this, ever, you know?

35:49.584 --> 35:52.754
And she would... She'd kill me
if she knew I was here, but...

35:52.787 --> 35:55.556
but I just wanna see her happy.

35:58.826 --> 35:59.894
What about you?

35:59.927 --> 36:01.596
I mean what'd make you happy?

36:10.004 --> 36:11.673
Do you wanna see us again?

36:14.942 --> 36:17.578
Yes, I want to see you again.

36:18.311 --> 36:19.479
Then, tell her so.

36:20.748 --> 36:23.283
God, I am wrecked.

36:23.316 --> 36:27.955
John and I, we were up until like 1:00 a.m.
last night, we were watching <i>The Office.</i>

36:27.989 --> 36:30.190
You know, that Michael Scott,
he gets me every time.

37:07.995 --> 37:09.229
Oh, sorry.

37:57.545 --> 37:58.913
I don't know.

38:47.628 --> 38:48.663
Uh...

38:56.737 --> 38:59.640
Is it weird that I'm starting
to feel bad for normal couples?

39:00.440 --> 39:02.409
Bad how?

39:02.442 --> 39:05.613
Like it's some default setting
they don't know to change

39:05.646 --> 39:08.649
or they secretly
want to, but won't.

39:10.751 --> 39:13.721
Or they cheat or divorce.

39:13.754 --> 39:16.657
Or they bottle it all up,
and let their animosity grow,

39:16.691 --> 39:18.593
and then one day,

39:18.626 --> 39:20.795
they come home,
and shove you in a potato sack...

39:22.997 --> 39:26.133
It's just unrealistic
to expect one person

39:26.167 --> 39:28.636
to fulfill all your needs
for the rest of your life.

39:29.136 --> 39:31.005
Yeah.

39:31.038 --> 39:32.907
You need at least
two people for that.

39:33.875 --> 39:35.910
Well, it's a start.
You know what I mean.

39:35.943 --> 39:39.547
I just think it's unrealistic
to ask anyone to fulfill you.

39:39.580 --> 39:41.949
I think everyone's responsible
for their own happiness.

39:44.218 --> 39:46.419
Those are the two
happiest people up here.

39:49.924 --> 39:51.993
You guys should
totally get a dog.

39:52.026 --> 39:54.494
Uh, we're not allowed
to have pets at the apartment.

39:54.528 --> 39:58.032
There is nothing in that relationship
that needs to be ironed out.

39:58.065 --> 39:59.867
There's no negotiation,
no fighting,

39:59.901 --> 40:03.771
they just... love each other.

40:03.804 --> 40:05.907
I wonder how their sex life is.

40:05.940 --> 40:07.575
I think we got them beat there.

40:17.752 --> 40:18.786
Hey.

40:21.188 --> 40:22.556
You're all perked up.

40:22.590 --> 40:24.759
Yeah, just hiked up Griffith.

40:25.593 --> 40:27.528
I ran up actually.

40:27.561 --> 40:28.829
With your married couple?

40:28.863 --> 40:29.897
Yep.

40:30.865 --> 40:31.966
Rent.

40:31.999 --> 40:33.200
I'm working on it.

40:34.101 --> 40:35.803
Move.

40:35.836 --> 40:37.238
You're working on it?

40:37.271 --> 40:39.140
You work like two shifts
a week at a cafe

40:39.173 --> 40:41.842
and then you spend the rest of your
time laying around my living room

40:41.876 --> 40:44.178
or doin' nature walks
with bored married couples.

40:44.211 --> 40:45.913
Why don't you just ask
mom and dad for the rest?

40:45.947 --> 40:48.215
I mean they pay for every
other fuckin' thing for you.

40:48.249 --> 40:50.217
They helped me out
with a couple of things

40:50.251 --> 40:52.253
as a favor for
letting you crash here.

40:52.286 --> 40:55.122
- Otherwise you'd just show up on their doorstep.
- Jesus.

40:55.156 --> 40:58.626
So like your couple, are they gonna
add you to their cellphone plan

40:58.659 --> 41:00.094
or I mean I don't know,
how does it work when you...

41:00.127 --> 41:02.596
when you tack yourself
onto someone's relationship.

41:04.665 --> 41:06.867
Look, I know that you and Ethan
are having a hard time right now,

41:06.901 --> 41:08.736
but you really don't need to take it out on me.

41:08.769 --> 41:10.938
I mean, I'm sorry
that I'm happy for once.

41:10.972 --> 41:14.008
And I'm happy for you
as long as you realize

41:14.041 --> 41:17.144
that this whole thing
you're doing is idiotic.

41:17.178 --> 41:18.946
Why are you being such a prick?

41:18.980 --> 41:20.147
I mean how's this
any of your business?

41:20.181 --> 41:21.716
- I'm just sayin'.
- You're saying what?

41:21.749 --> 41:23.985
I'm just saying
that they're using you

41:24.018 --> 41:25.485
to work through
their own problems.

41:25.519 --> 41:28.522
I can't tell you how many of my friends
are doing the same fuckin' shit.

41:28.556 --> 41:30.291
"Yeah, let's invite
three people,

41:30.324 --> 41:32.159
four people,
ten, whatever."

41:32.193 --> 41:34.061
It always ends in drama.

41:34.095 --> 41:35.663
Like you would know.

41:35.696 --> 41:37.765
I'm TNT, bitch, I know drama.

41:39.433 --> 41:42.103
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but we don't have any drama.

41:42.136 --> 41:43.404
Okay, yet.

41:43.437 --> 41:45.873
No, honestly, I mean they're
just like really fuckin' chill.

41:45.906 --> 41:46.974
They don't even
fight with each other.

41:47.008 --> 41:49.877
Okay, well...
Now I know they're full of shit.

41:53.948 --> 41:56.217
Oh, what? Come on,
you don't even wanna talk about it?

41:56.250 --> 41:57.818
I'm taking a shower.

41:57.852 --> 41:58.986
Rent.

42:02.156 --> 42:04.925
It's the Mediterranean one.
That's the one you like, right?

42:04.959 --> 42:06.961
Oh, great.

42:06.994 --> 42:08.596
It's hard to keep up
with you sometimes, you know,

42:08.629 --> 42:10.231
like, what you like,
what you don't like?

42:13.300 --> 42:14.835
It's fine, thanks.

42:20.641 --> 42:23.244
You guys are,
uh, popular?

42:23.277 --> 42:26.047
Yeah, it's Olivia,
she's having a roommate drama.

42:26.080 --> 42:29.150
Hm, I'll bet.
Can you imagine living with her?

42:37.124 --> 42:38.292
Okay, I'm sorry I have to.

42:38.325 --> 42:40.127
- Carrie.
- No, I have to.

42:40.161 --> 42:41.662
You don't have to.

42:41.695 --> 42:42.830
You have to what?

42:44.065 --> 42:45.766
I saw you the other day.

42:48.335 --> 42:49.804
You think you saw her.

42:49.837 --> 42:51.705
- I know, John.
- Saw me what?

42:54.642 --> 42:58.245
With Olivia, in the parking
lot, at Silverlight Coffee,

42:58.279 --> 43:01.082
K-I-S-S-I-N-G-ing.

43:04.785 --> 43:05.986
I'm sorry, Drew.

43:10.224 --> 43:12.259
No, um, I'm sorry.

43:13.661 --> 43:15.062
Look, you guys
are our friends.

43:15.096 --> 43:16.597
We should have
told you sooner.

43:17.164 --> 43:18.666
Told us what?

43:20.301 --> 43:21.802
We're dating.

43:26.373 --> 43:28.342
Like how?

43:28.375 --> 43:32.179
We're... um... we're seeing each
other, the three of us.

43:34.115 --> 43:36.117
You guys are fucking Olivia.

43:36.150 --> 43:37.184
John.

43:38.452 --> 43:40.254
Why?

43:40.287 --> 43:41.523
What do you mean?

43:41.556 --> 43:44.825
Well, you're married.
You're supposed to... You're not...

43:44.859 --> 43:47.228
Well, if you guys were having
problems, why didn't you come to us?

43:47.261 --> 43:48.896
We weren't, we aren't.

43:48.929 --> 43:52.233
And even if we were,
what makes you such an authority

43:52.266 --> 43:54.668
on healthy relationships
that we would come to you?

43:54.702 --> 43:58.205
Hey, I think what
we're like all tryin'

43:58.239 --> 44:03.010
to understand here
is who does what,

44:03.043 --> 44:06.380
who does what with who,
and what goes in...

44:06.413 --> 44:07.448
Okay, that's not
what we're asking.

44:07.481 --> 44:08.949
Look, we can talk about
it if you're curious.

44:08.983 --> 44:10.718
- I don't care.
- Well, I kind of do.

44:10.751 --> 44:13.087
I don't want to know.
I don't need to know.

44:13.120 --> 44:16.957
I... I'm just shocked and I...
I didn't think that you were like...

44:16.991 --> 44:19.260
- Like what?
- Like twisted.

44:19.293 --> 44:20.694
- Twisted?
- Mm.

44:20.728 --> 44:22.763
Okay, no, you're not twisted.

44:22.796 --> 44:24.798
At least, we don't have to
fight every time we wanna fuck.

44:24.832 --> 44:26.433
- Nena.
- No, that's why I don't wanna say anything.

44:26.467 --> 44:27.636
Who do you think you are?

44:27.668 --> 44:28.669
Well, we're getting
married, and it's scary,

44:28.702 --> 44:31.071
and we look up to you guys
as like an example,

44:31.105 --> 44:33.107
and then it turns out
you've just been like

44:33.140 --> 44:35.876
sleeping with someone this entire time.
I just feel betrayed.

44:40.214 --> 44:42.883
You know, um, I think
we're gonna take off.

44:42.917 --> 44:44.351
Our girlfriend is coming over

44:45.520 --> 44:47.221
and we're gonna order pad thai.

44:54.762 --> 44:56.063
Wait, guys.

44:57.798 --> 45:00.501
Guys, Nena, wait.

45:00.535 --> 45:03.237
We just don't wanna see you
guys throw away what you have.

45:04.506 --> 45:06.140
We've never been happier.

45:12.947 --> 45:14.148
Uh...

45:20.955 --> 45:22.223
I was gonna eat that.

45:52.219 --> 45:53.420
Can we come out yet?

45:53.454 --> 45:54.955
No!

45:54.989 --> 45:56.123
I have to pee.

45:56.156 --> 45:57.391
That's not true.

45:58.993 --> 46:01.262
It's kind of fun to be
kept waiting, isn't it?

46:01.295 --> 46:02.930
This is annoying as fuck.

46:11.472 --> 46:15.843
Are we...
doing the right thing?

46:15.876 --> 46:19.480
Do not let Carrie
get into your head.

46:19.514 --> 46:21.181
I don't give a shit
what she thinks.

46:22.449 --> 46:24.852
Who does she think
she is, seriously?

46:24.885 --> 46:26.588
Look, she's insecure,
that's all.

46:26.621 --> 46:28.822
Can you just hate her
with me for a second?

46:34.161 --> 46:35.963
Do you want me
to kill her?

46:38.065 --> 46:40.134
- Yes.
- How?

46:40.167 --> 46:41.468
I will do it for you.

46:48.208 --> 46:50.612
Yeah, she can't move in
with us.

46:50.645 --> 46:54.048
Okay, I didn't even know that
that was on the table, so...

46:54.081 --> 46:56.183
I mean she can crash here
a couple of nights,

46:56.216 --> 46:58.485
but I don't think we're ready
for more than that.

46:58.520 --> 46:59.820
Do you?

46:59.853 --> 47:05.225
I'm... not ready if you're not
ready, or it's whatever you want.

47:09.096 --> 47:10.264
Hm.

47:14.234 --> 47:15.302
Okay, kids.

47:20.174 --> 47:24.311
Oh, my God.
Look at this.

47:24.345 --> 47:26.380
I thought
I'd be romantic.

47:26.413 --> 47:28.415
Oh, my God,
look at all this stuff.

47:29.517 --> 47:31.553
- I love it.
- Good?

47:31.586 --> 47:33.253
Yeah, it looks great.

47:33.287 --> 47:36.490
- Yeah.
- You did all this?

47:36.524 --> 47:38.959
With my bare hands. Just for you.
You see that now.

47:40.628 --> 47:41.629
Perfect.

47:47.134 --> 47:48.135
Well...

47:49.436 --> 47:50.505
to you guys.

47:51.939 --> 47:54.208
Thank you for getting me
out of the house.

47:54.743 --> 47:56.043
No, fuck that.

47:57.411 --> 47:59.480
- To us.
- To us.

48:04.385 --> 48:05.419
Us.

48:18.365 --> 48:20.401
We should probably
invest in a third stool.

48:29.209 --> 48:30.512
Are you awake?

48:33.581 --> 48:34.982
Yeah.

48:41.321 --> 48:43.090
What will
you do for rent?

48:43.123 --> 48:45.058
Try to pick up more shifts?

48:45.092 --> 48:46.360
I don't know.

48:46.393 --> 48:49.997
My brother's just nuts
and he makes it very clear

48:50.030 --> 48:53.033
that it's his place
and not mine.

48:53.066 --> 48:54.569
I need to get the fuck
out of there,

48:54.602 --> 48:57.137
but it still doesn't solve
my rent problem,

48:57.171 --> 48:59.173
'cause, um...

48:59.206 --> 49:01.709
I'm thinking about
quitting the coffee shop.

49:03.745 --> 49:04.978
Hm.

49:06.447 --> 49:07.715
Because of Carrie?

49:09.383 --> 49:12.554
No, I... I don't
give a shit about that.

49:12.587 --> 49:17.391
It actually is something to do
with what you were saying.

49:17.424 --> 49:20.562
I should just be
doing something.

49:20.595 --> 49:24.632
So I've been thinking about
getting back into acting.

49:26.400 --> 49:27.769
Really?

49:29.269 --> 49:30.772
That's great.

49:30.805 --> 49:31.906
I just loved it, you know?

49:31.940 --> 49:35.743
I just had so much in me
that I just wanted to get out.

49:37.144 --> 49:38.245
And, uh...

49:39.179 --> 49:42.316
and then, for a while,
I just had nothing.

49:46.286 --> 49:48.255
But I still have that voice
in the back of my head

49:48.288 --> 49:50.290
that's just telling me,
"Just go for it."

49:53.393 --> 49:54.796
- Hm.
- I don't know.

49:54.829 --> 49:58.031
It's hard for me to trust it,
because of what happened last time.

50:02.637 --> 50:05.773
I'm never sure of anything.

50:07.241 --> 50:09.142
I'm still not sure about this.

50:10.745 --> 50:13.146
I wasn't even sure
when I married Drew.

50:17.217 --> 50:19.453
Maybe Carrie is right,
maybe I am twisted.

50:26.794 --> 50:30.464
You know, maybe it's not
about being sure or unsure.

50:32.466 --> 50:34.334
Maybe it's just
about being brave.

50:44.411 --> 50:47.047
You could stay with us
for a while if you wanted to.

50:50.885 --> 50:52.219
I want you to.

52:07.962 --> 52:09.262
Morning.

52:10.665 --> 52:12.834
Hey, I hope you're
okay with this.

52:12.867 --> 52:15.435
It was just driving me nuts
seeing you live out of bags.

52:16.871 --> 52:18.606
I just want you
to feel at home.

52:21.943 --> 52:23.477
I do.

52:32.419 --> 52:33.755
Shit.

52:33.788 --> 52:34.889
What?

52:34.922 --> 52:36.658
I just didn't get that short.

52:37.324 --> 52:39.326
The USC thing?

52:39.359 --> 52:42.462
I'm not even qualified enough to
be murdered in a student film.

52:42.496 --> 52:43.564
Oh, come on.

52:43.598 --> 52:46.199
But if I can't even book
something that doesn't pay,

52:46.233 --> 52:47.702
how am I ever gonna book
something that does?

52:47.735 --> 52:49.570
You'll crack it,
don't worry.

52:54.909 --> 52:57.912
I guess I just
feel like a mooch.

52:57.945 --> 53:00.414
Would you stop?
We really don't mind.

53:17.297 --> 53:19.299
So, I have to go
to work in a bit.

53:20.434 --> 53:21.703
What are you guys up to today?

53:27.709 --> 53:28.910
Cool, cool.

53:30.778 --> 53:31.813
Cool.

53:33.346 --> 53:34.916
All these roles
are just such garbage.

53:34.949 --> 53:37.719
Just like rape victims
seeking revenge

53:37.752 --> 53:41.622
or quirky love interest
for a whiny white guy.

53:41.656 --> 53:45.026
It's like manic pixie
dream girl shit.

53:45.059 --> 53:46.761
You know, I once did
web development

53:46.794 --> 53:50.464
for a trans porn site called
"manic pixie dick girls"?

53:51.833 --> 53:52.834
You know, sometimes
when we're hooking up,

53:52.867 --> 53:54.969
you start acting like
one of those porn guys?

53:57.672 --> 53:58.740
A porn guy?

53:58.773 --> 54:00.007
Mm-hm.

54:00.041 --> 54:01.441
There are certain things
that you say

54:01.475 --> 54:03.678
and there is a way
that your voice gets...

54:06.714 --> 54:08.783
It seems a bit affected,
I don't know.

54:08.816 --> 54:09.884
Affected?

54:10.250 --> 54:12.053
All right.

54:12.086 --> 54:15.022
- Okay.
- No, no, it's hot.

54:15.056 --> 54:17.424
Do not get me wrong.

54:17.457 --> 54:20.494
It's just sometimes
it seems like you're acting

54:20.528 --> 54:22.563
or like putting on
a performance.

54:22.597 --> 54:25.432
Well, in all fairness,
sex sort of is like a performance.

54:25.465 --> 54:27.334
I mean you're acting,
you're reacting.

54:27.769 --> 54:28.903
Improvising.

54:28.936 --> 54:30.905
Okay, but like
even going with that,

54:30.938 --> 54:34.542
any good performance
reveals some kind of truth.

54:34.575 --> 54:35.843
It's like with Nena, you know?

54:35.877 --> 54:38.546
How she feels like she has to
overthink every little thing.

54:39.847 --> 54:41.616
Until and unless
she's in the bedroom.

54:41.649 --> 54:43.017
Yes, exactly.

54:43.050 --> 54:44.085
And then a switch gets flipped,

54:44.118 --> 54:47.387
and she's this wild
pleasure-seeking adventurer

54:47.420 --> 54:48.556
that she really is.

54:49.657 --> 54:52.593
She just likes to be taken,
you know,

54:52.627 --> 54:54.427
and that's revealing.

54:56.130 --> 55:00.500
Do you know that sometimes
when we're having...

55:01.869 --> 55:03.403
When we're fucking.

55:03.436 --> 55:06.040
I, uh, act like I'm in control,

55:06.073 --> 55:08.009
because I know that that's
what she wants me to do.

55:08.042 --> 55:11.012
You know, and it's fun,
but I don't know,

55:11.045 --> 55:16.050
it's like... it's not something
that comes naturally to me.

55:17.018 --> 55:18.586
No, I... I get that.

55:18.619 --> 55:20.353
You know,
that's one of the reasons

55:20.387 --> 55:24.058
with you why it's so good,
because you know, you are...

55:25.560 --> 55:27.662
How do I put this...
More, um...

55:29.429 --> 55:30.932
Aggressive.

55:30.965 --> 55:32.867
Aggressive, you know?

55:32.900 --> 55:34.101
And she loves that.

55:34.135 --> 55:35.203
And I love that.

55:35.236 --> 55:37.772
I don't know, I think
this whole aggressive thing

55:37.805 --> 55:39.140
is actually new for me.

55:39.173 --> 55:41.976
At least, all those like
years of modeling and acting,

55:42.009 --> 55:44.444
just being told
what to do all the time,

55:44.477 --> 55:46.547
so I like being bossy
when I get the chance.

55:46.581 --> 55:47.815
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

55:51.752 --> 55:53.888
You know, it's funny
you should say that,

55:54.989 --> 55:58.626
because... there is this, uh...

55:59.794 --> 56:00.795
this thing...

56:01.929 --> 56:04.765
that I've wanted
to try for a while.

56:05.800 --> 56:06.834
Okay.

56:16.577 --> 56:17.879
Are you ready, boy?

56:17.912 --> 56:19.981
Yes, step on me, please.

56:21.649 --> 56:22.984
Did you just tell me
what to do?

56:23.885 --> 56:25.620
No, I was just asking.

56:25.653 --> 56:26.921
Shut the fuck up.

56:28.122 --> 56:29.624
Open your mouth.

56:29.657 --> 56:30.725
Which one?

56:31.726 --> 56:32.894
What?

56:32.927 --> 56:34.695
You want me to shut up or
you want me to open my mouth.

56:36.697 --> 56:37.765
Ow!

56:37.798 --> 56:39.734
I'm so sorry, are you okay?

56:39.767 --> 56:42.570
No, I'm good.
I'm okay. I'm...

56:42.603 --> 56:43.905
No, you're not.

56:47.909 --> 56:49.944
You're in a lot of trouble,
do you understand me?

56:49.977 --> 56:51.112
Mm-hm.

57:07.494 --> 57:08.963
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

57:09.997 --> 57:11.165
Right where I left you.

57:11.198 --> 57:12.566
More or less.

57:41.963 --> 57:43.164
Hey!

57:45.166 --> 57:46.734
What happened here?

57:46.767 --> 57:48.669
Oh, you know, just...

57:50.237 --> 57:51.539
So how was your day?

57:53.007 --> 57:54.041
All right.

57:59.046 --> 58:00.781
What's wrong?

58:00.815 --> 58:01.949
Nothing.

58:13.094 --> 58:15.262
So are you mad or...

58:15.296 --> 58:16.530
I'm not mad.

58:16.564 --> 58:18.799
I shouldn't even be surprised.

58:18.833 --> 58:22.703
I'm at work all day and yeah,
what else would you guys do?

58:22.737 --> 58:24.572
We haven't even talked about
whether we can

58:24.605 --> 58:26.941
sleep with each other
if we're not all here.

58:26.974 --> 58:28.876
I assumed you guys
already had.

58:28.909 --> 58:31.178
Yeah, well, we haven't.

58:31.212 --> 58:35.016
Well, I thought to text you
and ask you if it was okay,

58:35.049 --> 58:37.318
but then I thought
that would be weird, so...

58:37.351 --> 58:38.886
I honestly thought you
guys had talked about this.

58:38.919 --> 58:40.321
I thought we were all
on the same page.

58:40.354 --> 58:41.922
I guess we're not.

58:44.258 --> 58:46.060
I have a question.

58:47.661 --> 58:50.731
Since we've been
seeing each other,

58:50.765 --> 58:54.135
have you guys been sleeping
with anyone else?

58:55.669 --> 58:56.771
I haven't.

58:57.905 --> 58:59.040
No, of course not.

59:00.241 --> 59:01.876
But if I wanted to...

59:05.346 --> 59:06.480
Do you want to?

59:06.515 --> 59:08.749
No, there's...
I mean there's no one in particular,

59:08.783 --> 59:11.852
but if you think about it,
it's not really equal.

59:12.787 --> 59:14.722
How?

59:14.755 --> 59:16.857
So we're all in
this relationship,

59:16.891 --> 59:19.693
but you two are still
in your own relationship.

59:20.361 --> 59:22.763
Like if I wasn't here,

59:22.797 --> 59:24.331
would you two
still sleep together?

59:26.901 --> 59:29.236
Well... yeah.

59:31.872 --> 59:33.040
Not that we have.

59:35.376 --> 59:37.044
What is that supposed to mean?

59:38.345 --> 59:40.347
We just haven't in a while.

59:42.416 --> 59:44.718
I'm working all day.

59:44.752 --> 59:46.654
You guys get to hang out,
and go to brunch,

59:46.687 --> 59:50.024
and do weird sex shit,
and I'm stuck at work. That's not fair.

59:50.057 --> 59:53.227
Okay, so when it's somethin' I wanna
do, suddenly it's weird.

59:53.260 --> 59:55.729
It is weird.
I'm sorry, Drew, it is fucking weird.

59:55.763 --> 59:56.697
That is so unfair.

59:56.730 --> 59:58.365
Do you not understand
how unfair that is?

59:58.399 --> 01:00:00.201
Look, if you guys need to talk,
I can just step out.

01:00:00.234 --> 01:00:03.003
Yeah, but that's...
No, because that's unfair, too,

01:00:03.037 --> 01:00:07.007
because we all agreed to this,
you live here now,

01:00:07.041 --> 01:00:09.243
you're a part of this,
and you shouldn't have to leave.

01:00:09.276 --> 01:00:12.346
But maybe me staying
with you guys, it's just...

01:00:12.379 --> 01:00:14.715
Maybe you're not ready
for that, you know?

01:00:14.748 --> 01:00:15.983
Maybe this is just a mistake.

01:00:16.016 --> 01:00:21.288
No, I want you here,
just the idea of you two without me...

01:00:21.322 --> 01:00:25.092
You two were the ones that wanted this
whole free-flowing California shit.

01:00:25.126 --> 01:00:26.360
I do want it to be free,

01:00:26.393 --> 01:00:28.195
I don't wanna hold
either of you back,

01:00:28.229 --> 01:00:29.930
but we are married.

01:00:29.964 --> 01:00:32.967
There are some things
that are just ours

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.302
and we should respect that.

01:00:36.137 --> 01:00:37.972
Okay, like what?

01:00:40.374 --> 01:00:41.408
Like...

01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:45.346
I don't want the two of you
together without me.

01:00:45.379 --> 01:00:47.815
I'm sorry, I just don't.

01:00:49.350 --> 01:00:50.451
Okay.

01:00:50.484 --> 01:00:52.753
And I know
that's not equal

01:00:52.786 --> 01:00:54.155
and it puts you
in a weird position,

01:00:54.188 --> 01:00:57.024
so if you wanna sleep
with other people, then...

01:00:58.459 --> 01:01:00.794
I guess... you know.

01:01:04.431 --> 01:01:06.066
Yeah, all right.

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:07.268
Yeah, I got you.

01:01:20.481 --> 01:01:22.216
Where are you going?

01:01:22.249 --> 01:01:23.784
Just going out
for a bit.

01:01:25.085 --> 01:01:26.787
But where, though?

01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:29.924
I don't know,
I'm just going out. Out.

01:01:30.291 --> 01:01:31.358
Out.

01:01:45.839 --> 01:01:48.008
If you're asking me to move back
in, the answer's "no".

01:01:48.042 --> 01:01:49.143
I'm not.

01:01:50.911 --> 01:01:52.046
Like I'm sorry
things aren't working out

01:01:52.079 --> 01:01:54.481
with your married couple,
but you know, I need my space.

01:01:54.516 --> 01:01:56.016
I'm not, it's fine.

01:01:59.453 --> 01:02:02.790
Ethan and I are...
are talking again.

01:02:02.823 --> 01:02:05.527
That's great.
Feeling very optimistic for you both.

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:06.827
Thank you. Yeah.

01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:08.028
You know,
if he stops being an idiot,

01:02:08.062 --> 01:02:10.030
it might actually
work out this time.

01:02:10.064 --> 01:02:11.999
Why is he an idiot, again?

01:02:12.032 --> 01:02:14.969
Oh, he just like won't admit
that he needs me, you know?

01:02:15.002 --> 01:02:18.239
Fucked up as I am,
I'm what he wants.

01:02:18.272 --> 01:02:20.908
Why's that? You're just hot shit.

01:02:20.941 --> 01:02:22.443
Oh, fuck off.

01:02:22.476 --> 01:02:24.311
- Do you wanna know why though, honestly?
- Mm-hm.

01:02:24.345 --> 01:02:25.813
Because I...
I learned it from you.

01:02:27.314 --> 01:02:30.818
You get them all riled up,
you get them on the hook,

01:02:30.851 --> 01:02:32.820
and then you push 'em away.

01:02:35.022 --> 01:02:36.457
What do you mean?

01:02:36.490 --> 01:02:37.958
Well, like I didn't
speak to him for like...

01:02:37.992 --> 01:02:38.993
like a month
or whatever, right?

01:02:39.026 --> 01:02:41.362
That made him realize
how badly he needed me.

01:02:41.395 --> 01:02:43.297
- Yeah, but...
- Like, I'm a mess.

01:02:43.330 --> 01:02:45.266
Look at me, you know?
And he wants me.

01:02:45.299 --> 01:02:46.900
He's desperate
to get back with me.

01:02:46.934 --> 01:02:49.903
And I don't even think he cares if I
fuck around on him or whatever, you know?

01:02:49.937 --> 01:02:51.939
He's always just gonna
keep coming back to me.

01:02:54.542 --> 01:02:56.010
I don't do that, though.

01:02:57.344 --> 01:02:58.846
Yeah, you do.

01:02:58.879 --> 01:03:00.515
You've been doing that
since middle school.

01:03:00.548 --> 01:03:02.584
You find someone,
pull 'em in, to the point

01:03:02.617 --> 01:03:05.119
that they're like
obsessed with you,

01:03:05.152 --> 01:03:07.187
and then you just pull away.

01:03:10.224 --> 01:03:12.092
- That's bullshit.
- You want another beer?

01:03:29.544 --> 01:03:31.178
She's been gone a while.

01:03:38.352 --> 01:03:40.054
Say something.

01:03:42.323 --> 01:03:43.490
Like what?

01:03:46.661 --> 01:03:47.961
Something.

01:03:49.897 --> 01:03:51.231
Give me something.

01:03:55.202 --> 01:03:57.304
I am not going
to fight with you.

01:03:58.906 --> 01:04:00.908
I'm not asking for a fight.

01:04:03.911 --> 01:04:05.846
Obviously, you need
somebody to fight with,

01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:08.449
and it's not going to be me.

01:04:12.486 --> 01:04:15.255
You know, not saying anything
can be just as aggressive

01:04:15.289 --> 01:04:16.990
as pissing in someone's face?

01:04:18.926 --> 01:04:20.160
You know that, right?

01:04:27.669 --> 01:04:29.236
But you like this, don't you?

01:04:31.506 --> 01:04:33.073
Being treated like shit?

01:04:35.376 --> 01:04:36.944
This is what you want, right?

01:04:38.713 --> 01:04:39.980
To be walked all over...

01:04:40.013 --> 01:04:41.048
Nena.

01:04:42.282 --> 01:04:44.952
Fuck me.
Who am I to say "no", you know.

01:04:44.985 --> 01:04:47.154
Fuck me for loving you
too much, for...

01:04:47.187 --> 01:04:49.123
for not wanting
to see you that way,

01:04:49.156 --> 01:04:51.425
for not wanting to...
to degrade you.

01:04:51.458 --> 01:04:52.560
- Oh, please.
- What did she do?

01:04:52.594 --> 01:04:55.229
What? Did she step on you?
Did she call you names?

01:04:56.363 --> 01:04:57.931
Did she call you a "bitch"?

01:04:59.032 --> 01:05:00.568
Yes.

01:05:00.602 --> 01:05:04.104
And... and that's fun for you, to be
treated like dirt, to be treated like shit?

01:05:04.138 --> 01:05:06.708
Actually, it was fun.
It was really fun.

01:05:06.741 --> 01:05:09.577
It was fuckin' amazing,
if you really wanna know.

01:05:09.611 --> 01:05:11.579
Well... well, fuck it,
I can do that,

01:05:11.613 --> 01:05:13.280
- if that's what you want.
- No.

01:05:13.313 --> 01:05:14.649
No, no, no, I...
I can do that.

01:05:14.682 --> 01:05:15.717
I can treat you like shit.

01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:17.384
I don't want you to.

01:05:19.153 --> 01:05:21.388
Why... why her and not me?

01:05:24.158 --> 01:05:25.259
Why?

01:05:27.494 --> 01:05:31.265
Because Olivia doesn't
actually see me that way.

01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:43.944
All right.

01:06:41.636 --> 01:06:42.670
Hey.

01:06:44.304 --> 01:06:45.405
Hey.

01:06:49.109 --> 01:06:50.210
Where have you been?

01:06:51.211 --> 01:06:52.647
I have been out.

01:06:56.149 --> 01:06:57.351
Did you have fun?

01:06:58.385 --> 01:06:59.521
What?

01:07:01.823 --> 01:07:03.625
With whoever you were out with,
what'd you guys do?

01:07:03.658 --> 01:07:05.058
What are you doing?

01:07:08.563 --> 01:07:10.665
I'm not doing anything.
What are you doing?

01:07:12.199 --> 01:07:14.334
I'm going to drink
some water and go to bed.

01:07:16.403 --> 01:07:17.505
Fine.

01:07:20.107 --> 01:07:21.208
But it was fun, though?

01:07:21.241 --> 01:07:24.579
What was... What fun?
Have you seen my water bottle?

01:07:24.612 --> 01:07:26.681
The friend you saw,
who I don't know.

01:07:28.348 --> 01:07:29.784
Is it a him or her?

01:07:34.522 --> 01:07:37.090
Did you fuck them, him or her?

01:07:39.594 --> 01:07:41.094
That's a rude question.

01:07:44.431 --> 01:07:47.401
It's fine, if you did. I just...
I have the right to know.

01:07:47.434 --> 01:07:48.468
Do you?

01:07:50.638 --> 01:07:53.675
Yes, actually I do.
We're dating, you're living here.

01:07:53.708 --> 01:07:55.543
Yeah, under your roof, yeah.

01:07:55.577 --> 01:07:57.411
No, I hear you
loud and fucking clear.

01:07:57.444 --> 01:07:59.446
Where... where is
my water bottle?

01:07:59.479 --> 01:08:01.348
Why do you keep moving
all of my shit?

01:08:12.326 --> 01:08:15.095
It's in the cabinet
across from the refrigerator.

01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:18.566
Where?

01:08:20.535 --> 01:08:22.301
Behind the plastic cups.

01:08:25.305 --> 01:08:27.207
Well, it's not
fuckin' here, so...

01:08:33.279 --> 01:08:34.816
Just tell me,
did you do it or not?

01:08:37.885 --> 01:08:39.720
Well, if I did,
that would be all right

01:08:39.754 --> 01:08:41.788
according to your
little flow chart, right?

01:08:43.591 --> 01:08:46.193
My flowchart?

01:08:46.225 --> 01:08:50.430
Well, you get to fuck Drew,
I get to fuck you guys together,

01:08:50.464 --> 01:08:51.698
then I get to fuck
whoever I want.

01:08:51.733 --> 01:08:54.301
I mean that was the deal,
right, fair and equal?

01:08:55.903 --> 01:08:58.506
I meant that abstractly.

01:08:58.538 --> 01:09:00.273
I'm not yours
and you're not mine,

01:09:00.307 --> 01:09:01.441
you made that very clear.

01:09:04.377 --> 01:09:05.580
That's not what I said.

01:09:09.216 --> 01:09:10.384
It doesn't matter.

01:09:15.255 --> 01:09:16.957
You did it, didn't you?

01:09:16.991 --> 01:09:18.893
- You did it. Who with even?
- Nena.

01:09:18.926 --> 01:09:20.528
Just tell me,
did you do it or not?

01:09:22.964 --> 01:09:25.365
Why are you just
so fuckin' insecure?

01:09:25.399 --> 01:09:27.535
- I'm insecure?
- Yes.

01:09:27.568 --> 01:09:30.772
That's why you have to manage
and control everyone around you.

01:09:30.805 --> 01:09:32.674
- It's because you're terrified.
- I'm terrified?

01:09:32.707 --> 01:09:33.774
Yes.

01:09:35.843 --> 01:09:38.345
At least, I'm not the one
who's so afraid of getting hurt

01:09:38.377 --> 01:09:40.413
that I go after someone
who's already married.

01:09:40.982 --> 01:09:42.182
What?

01:09:42.215 --> 01:09:45.352
Makes sense why you'd want me,
so you can only go so deep,

01:09:45.385 --> 01:09:47.319
so you only have to love
and be loved so much,

01:09:47.354 --> 01:09:49.657
so... so you always have
just one foot on the shore.

01:09:49.691 --> 01:09:50.957
Is this the shit that goes
through your head?

01:09:50.992 --> 01:09:52.492
And because I already
have someone,

01:09:52.527 --> 01:09:54.562
you can just leave
whenever you want guilt-free,

01:09:54.595 --> 01:09:57.297
and you don't have to
commit to anyone or anything.

01:09:57.330 --> 01:10:00.333
Okay, I'm not the one with
the weird commitment issues.

01:10:00.367 --> 01:10:01.536
You telling me shit like

01:10:01.569 --> 01:10:04.337
you don't know if marrying Drew
was the right decision?

01:10:04.371 --> 01:10:05.640
How am I supposed to take that?

01:10:05.673 --> 01:10:07.008
You know, that's not what I meant.

01:10:07.041 --> 01:10:10.545
I was saying despite how uncertain I
am, I still move forward.

01:10:10.578 --> 01:10:14.347
You do that because
the alternatives terrify you.

01:10:14.381 --> 01:10:16.617
You were terrified
of being alone

01:10:16.651 --> 01:10:17.952
and that's why
you married Drew

01:10:17.985 --> 01:10:19.754
but you still feel alone
when you're with him,

01:10:19.787 --> 01:10:21.689
and that's why you wanted
me here to begin with.

01:10:21.723 --> 01:10:22.824
That is not true.

01:10:22.857 --> 01:10:24.959
You know, at least,
I'm not afraid of getting hurt.

01:10:24.992 --> 01:10:26.627
You know, it's good to hurt.

01:10:26.661 --> 01:10:29.864
It's good to have
something to hurt about.

01:10:29.897 --> 01:10:32.033
And you need to be brave
in order to hurt.

01:10:32.066 --> 01:10:33.835
You don't know my hurt.

01:10:33.868 --> 01:10:36.571
You don't know what
it's like to take a step

01:10:36.604 --> 01:10:40.407
and then suddenly the ground just
crumbles beneath you for no reason.

01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:42.510
You don't know
how terrifying it is

01:10:42.543 --> 01:10:44.277
to walk through life like that

01:10:44.311 --> 01:10:47.414
so you don't get to talk
to me about being brave.

01:10:53.087 --> 01:10:54.354
I can't do this.

01:11:02.864 --> 01:11:04.532
What are you doing?

01:11:04.565 --> 01:11:06.000
You know what I'm doing.

01:11:54.414 --> 01:11:55.516
I'm sorry.

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:06.754
Hey.

01:14:43.884 --> 01:14:44.919
Hey!

01:14:46.053 --> 01:14:48.289
Oh, hey.

01:14:48.322 --> 01:14:50.224
We haven't seen you
in like forever!

01:14:50.257 --> 01:14:53.294
Yeah, I know.
I've just been, um...

01:14:53.327 --> 01:14:55.196
Yeah, we heard. I'm sorry.

01:14:56.263 --> 01:14:57.732
Heard what?

01:14:57.765 --> 01:14:59.667
Oh, well, Olivia came
back to the cafe

01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:01.068
and she told me what happened.

01:15:02.670 --> 01:15:03.637
Oh.

01:15:03.671 --> 01:15:06.240
And uh, she's uh,
coming to the wedding, too,

01:15:06.273 --> 01:15:08.743
just FYI, if that's cool.

01:15:11.012 --> 01:15:12.747
Okay.

01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:14.048
Sorry, when is that, again?

01:15:15.249 --> 01:15:17.752
Uh, this weekend.

01:15:17.785 --> 01:15:20.588
Oh, shit.
Sorry, you guys.

01:15:20.621 --> 01:15:22.089
I mean you are coming, right,

01:15:22.123 --> 01:15:24.191
'cause I know you didn't
send back the RSVP

01:15:24.225 --> 01:15:26.627
but you have to come.

01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:28.229
Of course, I'll...
I'll be there.

01:15:28.929 --> 01:15:30.898
- Cool.
- Um, oh!

01:15:30.931 --> 01:15:32.833
Do you wanna tell her
about the thing?

01:15:32.867 --> 01:15:34.101
Tell her about what thing?

01:15:34.135 --> 01:15:36.904
- Yeah, what thing?
- The thing!

01:15:36.937 --> 01:15:41.142
Oh, um, my boss
hooked me up with some molly

01:15:41.175 --> 01:15:43.711
and it's supposed
to be pretty good.

01:15:43.744 --> 01:15:47.114
Mm-hm, we're gonna do it
like a pre-wedding celebration

01:15:47.148 --> 01:15:48.682
and you guys should come over.

01:15:52.386 --> 01:15:53.821
I'll ask Drew.

01:16:04.198 --> 01:16:05.299
Drew?

01:16:08.669 --> 01:16:11.338
Can you come out and talk to me
like a grown-up, please?

01:16:13.808 --> 01:16:14.809
No.

01:16:33.994 --> 01:16:35.329
How much longer with this?

01:16:36.263 --> 01:16:37.364
I don't know.

01:16:38.132 --> 01:16:39.300
I like it in here.

01:16:41.335 --> 01:16:43.804
It's in the middle
of the living room.

01:16:45.406 --> 01:16:46.607
Is it?

01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:00.988
John and Carrie
wanna hang out tonight.

01:17:01.021 --> 01:17:03.090
- You wanna go?
- No.

01:17:04.892 --> 01:17:07.094
They say they have molly,
it could be fun.

01:17:08.062 --> 01:17:09.630
Take our minds off all this.

01:17:11.031 --> 01:17:12.633
It's a really terrible idea.

01:17:15.102 --> 01:17:17.338
Can we at least
try to go back to normal?

01:17:18.772 --> 01:17:21.041
This whole thing
has me so confused

01:17:21.075 --> 01:17:23.878
and I just want to go back
to where we were.

01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:39.093
Do you know what
the definition of insanity is?

01:17:40.861 --> 01:17:43.364
Setting up a tent in
the middle of the living room?

01:17:47.368 --> 01:17:48.769
We can't go back...

01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:51.372
and we can't go forward,

01:17:51.405 --> 01:17:55.943
because you don't know
where you wanna go.

01:17:56.810 --> 01:17:59.246
Because I don't know?

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:01.215
Because it's always
on me, always.

01:18:01.248 --> 01:18:05.319
Because you're a control freak
and that's fine with me.

01:18:05.352 --> 01:18:07.354
I love that. I just wish
that being in control

01:18:07.388 --> 01:18:09.924
made you happier, you know?

01:18:09.957 --> 01:18:13.861
I want you to be happy.
Your happiness is my happiness

01:18:13.894 --> 01:18:16.997
and I haven't
been happy lately.

01:18:17.031 --> 01:18:18.232
it's before Olivia,

01:18:18.265 --> 01:18:20.201
before we were married even.

01:18:20.234 --> 01:18:21.869
So that's on me too, right?

01:18:21.902 --> 01:18:23.137
I'm making you unhappy.

01:18:23.170 --> 01:18:25.940
I fucking live to serve you.

01:18:27.374 --> 01:18:29.743
I do, and I would
worship at your feet

01:18:29.777 --> 01:18:31.412
if you, you know,
would let me.

01:18:31.445 --> 01:18:33.214
- Drew, stop.
- No, this is...

01:18:33.247 --> 01:18:35.849
Listen, this is who I am.

01:18:36.483 --> 01:18:37.851
This is who the fuck I am.

01:18:37.885 --> 01:18:40.454
I like being told what to do,

01:18:40.487 --> 01:18:44.024
and I like being
a support beam,

01:18:44.058 --> 01:18:48.362
and I just wanted you
to be comfortable with that.

01:18:50.464 --> 01:18:52.366
You know? And I know...

01:18:53.434 --> 01:18:56.303
Look, I know you don't love me

01:18:56.337 --> 01:18:58.540
- as much as I love you.
- Drew.

01:18:58.573 --> 01:19:00.774
And I guess a part of me
always knew

01:19:00.808 --> 01:19:04.311
that you didn't really
wanna marry me,

01:19:04.345 --> 01:19:05.446
but I figured...

01:19:06.914 --> 01:19:09.517
like, in time you would,
you know,

01:19:09.551 --> 01:19:12.286
be as committed to me
as I am to you.

01:19:12.319 --> 01:19:14.989
Or at least be comfortable
with who we are.

01:19:15.022 --> 01:19:16.290
I am comfortable.

01:19:16.323 --> 01:19:18.526
You are the only person
I'm comfortable with.

01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:20.261
You take me for granted...

01:19:21.395 --> 01:19:23.163
and that's not the same thing.

01:19:25.499 --> 01:19:27.334
I let you have control,

01:19:28.135 --> 01:19:30.437
because I trust you,

01:19:30.471 --> 01:19:33.541
but Nena, you are flyin' us
into a fuckin' mountain.

01:19:39.847 --> 01:19:41.081
You're leaving, aren't you?

01:19:45.886 --> 01:19:48.355
I think maybe you need
to be alone right now.

01:19:48.389 --> 01:19:49.923
This is such horseshit.

01:19:49.957 --> 01:19:52.393
- Do not tell me what I need!
- Fine.

01:19:52.426 --> 01:19:54.928
- You wanna leave, say it.
- I don't want any of this.

01:19:54.962 --> 01:19:56.463
Say it, just fuckin' say it.

01:19:56.497 --> 01:19:58.899
You're not bein' a very good
friend to yourself right now.

01:19:58.932 --> 01:20:00.000
You're right.

01:20:00.034 --> 01:20:02.836
I am not being
a good friend to myself.

01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:04.572
I have one friend left
and he is leaving

01:20:04.606 --> 01:20:06.840
but he won't fucking admit it.

01:20:14.448 --> 01:20:15.816
I'm leaving.

01:22:08.362 --> 01:22:09.664
Hey, I'm Drew.

01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:14.669
- Ethan. Hey.
- Nice to meet you.

01:22:14.702 --> 01:22:16.236
Nice to meet you.

01:22:16.270 --> 01:22:19.206
And this is my brother Benny,
he's really nice.

01:22:31.018 --> 01:22:32.252
I get it, I guess.

01:22:40.728 --> 01:22:42.062
Welcome home.

01:22:55.476 --> 01:22:56.644
Mm.

01:23:20.067 --> 01:23:22.302
I don't know what the fuck
I was thinking.

01:23:23.705 --> 01:23:26.240
Hey. Hey, Nena Bonena.

01:23:26.273 --> 01:23:29.343
Coffina. Fee-fi-fo finna-bina.

01:23:29.376 --> 01:23:31.278
Neen, chickadee, chickadee,

01:23:31.311 --> 01:23:33.347
you don't have nothing
to worry about, okay?

01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:35.115
Okay, girlfriend,
I just want you to know

01:23:35.148 --> 01:23:36.551
that you are perfect
and wonderful,

01:23:36.584 --> 01:23:38.385
and you are so sweet,
and you're special.

01:23:38.418 --> 01:23:40.622
You're my special Barbie doll,
and you should be proud

01:23:40.655 --> 01:23:42.189
and I'm...
'cause I'm proud of you,

01:23:42.222 --> 01:23:45.259
and I love you... so much.

01:23:45.292 --> 01:23:47.327
I'm really glad
you guys ran into me.

01:23:47.361 --> 01:23:49.062
I missed you so much.

01:23:49.396 --> 01:23:50.832
Of course.

01:23:50.865 --> 01:23:53.300
You know, Nena,
I feel really bad

01:23:53.333 --> 01:23:55.202
about what happened last time.

01:23:55.235 --> 01:23:58.606
I was being
a judgmental biatch.

01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:00.508
I'm really, really sorry.

01:24:00.542 --> 01:24:02.710
You're my friends
and you were right.

01:24:02.744 --> 01:24:05.279
We were being naive
and so fucking stupid,

01:24:05.312 --> 01:24:07.080
I can't believe it now!

01:24:07.114 --> 01:24:09.651
No! You know, I actually thought
you were being really brave.

01:24:10.685 --> 01:24:12.152
- Yeah.
- 'Cause you know

01:24:12.185 --> 01:24:14.354
we've always kind of
looked up to you guys.

01:24:14.388 --> 01:24:17.357
Well, I don't know
if we're exactly role models.

01:24:19.226 --> 01:24:23.665
So you don't have to go,
like, too into it,

01:24:23.698 --> 01:24:26.701
but what exactly happened?

01:24:28.235 --> 01:24:30.538
Mm...

01:24:30.572 --> 01:24:33.541
sometimes things get messy.

01:24:33.575 --> 01:24:37.612
You know, when you have
two people,

01:24:37.645 --> 01:24:40.882
you can, like,
chart their bullshit

01:24:40.915 --> 01:24:42.717
on a straight line

01:24:43.718 --> 01:24:45.452
but then you add a third,

01:24:45.485 --> 01:24:49.489
and it, like,
triangulates things

01:24:50.490 --> 01:24:53.861
and makes a map of problems.

01:24:59.634 --> 01:25:02.369
I just miss them.
I fucking miss them right now.

01:25:02.402 --> 01:25:04.471
But what was it like?

01:25:07.374 --> 01:25:10.410
What are you...
I just told you.

01:25:10.444 --> 01:25:11.879
No.

01:25:11.913 --> 01:25:14.448
That's not what
we were uh...

01:25:14.481 --> 01:25:16.918
Oh. What...

01:25:16.951 --> 01:25:20.153
what he means is,
like, what about the...

01:25:20.622 --> 01:25:21.656
Like the sex?

01:25:21.689 --> 01:25:23.390
The sex.

01:25:24.491 --> 01:25:27.795
Oh, like, just the sex?

01:25:27.829 --> 01:25:30.665
- The sex.
- Yeah, the sex.

01:25:31.666 --> 01:25:32.900
Fun.

01:25:34.535 --> 01:25:36.871
Like really, really fun.

01:25:36.904 --> 01:25:40.808
Pure pleasure, pure fun,
and discovery,

01:25:40.842 --> 01:25:42.644
- no judgment.
- Mm-hm.

01:25:42.677 --> 01:25:45.546
And then afterwards,
you have to grapple with,

01:25:46.748 --> 01:25:48.916
"What was that?"

01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:50.450
And it depends on the person.

01:25:50.484 --> 01:25:52.252
I have my whatever issues.

01:25:52.954 --> 01:25:55.288
Oh, but it was great.

01:25:56.423 --> 01:25:59.594
That sounds... great.

01:25:59.627 --> 01:26:01.663
- Like really great.
- Mm.

01:26:03.765 --> 01:26:05.833
Mm, oh.

01:26:12.339 --> 01:26:14.509
Oh, no. Nope.

01:26:14.542 --> 01:26:16.844
Nope, nope, nope, no, no, no.

01:26:16.878 --> 01:26:18.378
Wait, really?

01:26:18.412 --> 01:26:19.714
Carrie, you guys...

01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:22.315
What the fuck?

01:26:22.349 --> 01:26:23.751
But I thought you wanted to.

01:26:23.785 --> 01:26:25.653
Why would you...

01:26:25.687 --> 01:26:27.789
Oh my God, I gotta go.

01:26:27.822 --> 01:26:29.691
Wait, no, no, I'm sorry,
I totally misunderstood.

01:26:29.724 --> 01:26:31.324
I thought you would be into it.

01:26:31.358 --> 01:26:33.594
Why? Because I'm automatically
down for three ways?

01:26:33.628 --> 01:26:35.362
I'm the three-way girl now?

01:26:35.395 --> 01:26:36.831
No, no, no, Nena,
no, we're sorry.

01:26:36.864 --> 01:26:38.866
We're just... we...
we really just fucked up.

01:26:40.267 --> 01:26:42.402
Did you guys plan this?

01:26:42.436 --> 01:26:44.271
No!

01:26:44.304 --> 01:26:46.007
Okay, maybe it was like
in the back of our minds,

01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:47.508
but I don't... I don't know.

01:26:47.542 --> 01:26:48.943
I don't know what
I was thinking. It's just...

01:26:48.976 --> 01:26:50.678
You know, we're getting married
in like two days

01:26:50.712 --> 01:26:52.412
and it's just
such a massive leap.

01:26:53.781 --> 01:26:54.982
And?

01:26:55.016 --> 01:26:57.484
Yeah, and we know each other
so well, but we don't know...

01:26:57.518 --> 01:26:59.386
Like how do you know
how well you know someone

01:26:59.419 --> 01:27:00.655
and how much...
How deep your love goes

01:27:00.688 --> 01:27:02.523
if you don't push yourself into
those scary places, you know?

01:27:02.557 --> 01:27:03.758
Yeah, all that stuff.

01:27:03.791 --> 01:27:05.392
We need to know
and we want to do it

01:27:05.425 --> 01:27:06.961
with someone who we can trust,
do you know what I mean?

01:27:09.764 --> 01:27:14.301
You know,
anybody can get married.

01:27:14.334 --> 01:27:16.571
You don't have to take
a test or anything.

01:27:16.604 --> 01:27:19.974
You're not doing anything
special or original,

01:27:20.608 --> 01:27:24.946
including whatever this was.

01:27:24.979 --> 01:27:27.380
If you don't trust each other,
don't fucking do it.

01:27:27.414 --> 01:27:28.783
Don't do any of it.

01:27:28.816 --> 01:27:30.818
This is not gonna
solve anything.

01:27:30.852 --> 01:27:34.387
If you've got some gap
you're trying to fill,

01:27:34.421 --> 01:27:35.556
this isn't gonna do it.

01:27:38.893 --> 01:27:40.995
Wait, you're still coming
to the wedding, right?

01:27:43.497 --> 01:27:44.799
<i>Are you awake?</i>

01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:46.934
Yeah.

01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:50.470
I can't sleep.

01:27:51.539 --> 01:27:52.540
Is it the couch?

01:27:55.009 --> 01:27:57.011
I don't know what
I'm doin' here.

01:28:01.582 --> 01:28:02.884
Do you wanna go back?

01:28:09.557 --> 01:28:11.526
Do you know what
she said to me this morning?

01:28:11.559 --> 01:28:12.492
Hm.

01:28:12.527 --> 01:28:15.630
She said, "Can we just
go back to normal?"

01:28:16.764 --> 01:28:17.832
Back to normal.

01:28:19.934 --> 01:28:23.838
I mean we can't just...
go back.

01:28:27.875 --> 01:28:29.911
'Cause there's more than
one way to go back.

01:28:31.679 --> 01:28:36.449
You can... find someone new,
you know...

01:28:38.085 --> 01:28:41.088
a different city
or a different country.

01:28:42.890 --> 01:28:45.026
Convince yourself that
they are different,

01:28:45.059 --> 01:28:47.427
and that you're different,

01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:49.030
and this time
will be different.

01:28:51.933 --> 01:28:55.002
You just end up
doing the same shit

01:28:55.036 --> 01:28:56.537
that you've always done.

01:29:01.175 --> 01:29:02.810
You think that's what we did?

01:29:05.546 --> 01:29:06.614
I don't know.

01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:09.817
I mean, it felt right
with both of you.

01:29:11.085 --> 01:29:13.788
You know, it was new,
it wasn't familiar,

01:29:14.889 --> 01:29:16.991
it was innocent, weirdly.

01:29:21.195 --> 01:29:22.830
You think it would
ever work out?

01:29:23.831 --> 01:29:24.966
Just me and you?

01:29:28.501 --> 01:29:29.670
I don't know.

01:29:30.705 --> 01:29:32.073
What do you think?

01:29:34.508 --> 01:29:36.376
I wish I could say "yes".

01:29:43.818 --> 01:29:46.654
It was good there
for a while, wasn't it?

01:29:51.025 --> 01:29:54.494
Yeah. For a while there it was.

01:31:22.283 --> 01:31:23.584
Should we go soon?

01:31:24.218 --> 01:31:25.686
Yeah, probably.

01:31:27.088 --> 01:31:29.090
So is your wife gonna be there?

01:31:29.123 --> 01:31:31.625
Um, probably not, no.

01:31:31.659 --> 01:31:34.095
You don't think so?

01:31:34.128 --> 01:31:36.630
No, I mean I gotta drag her out
of the house to do anything.

01:31:36.664 --> 01:31:38.265
You know, I had to drag her
to our wedding, so,

01:31:38.299 --> 01:31:40.234
and I'm not exaggerating
about that.

01:31:40.267 --> 01:31:42.103
No, I believe you.

01:31:42.136 --> 01:31:44.271
That's fucked up.

01:31:46.607 --> 01:31:48.142
You look handsome
when you dress up.

01:31:48.175 --> 01:31:49.610
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

01:31:49.643 --> 01:31:51.812
That's what
Nena's always saying.

01:31:51.846 --> 01:31:53.714
In this case,
she's tellin' the truth.

01:31:53.748 --> 01:31:55.116
Thanks, man.

01:31:55.149 --> 01:31:57.151
Nena always tells the truth,

01:31:57.184 --> 01:31:59.253
she just backtracks
on everything she says.

01:31:59.286 --> 01:32:00.988
She doesn't trust herself.

01:32:01.022 --> 01:32:02.723
Is there any more coffee?

01:32:06.594 --> 01:32:07.995
Shit.

01:32:08.029 --> 01:32:09.296
You want me
to make some more, babe?

01:32:09.330 --> 01:32:11.766
Oh, no, it's okay,
I'll just have some of yours.

01:32:25.079 --> 01:32:27.648
You know what your problem is?

01:32:27.681 --> 01:32:29.850
No, but I'd absolutely
love for you to tell us.

01:32:29.884 --> 01:32:30.785
Great.

01:32:30.818 --> 01:32:32.887
All you guys been doing
is talking shit

01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:34.922
about how insecure whatever
this chick is, right?

01:32:34.955 --> 01:32:37.758
Like how she can't
decide what she wants,

01:32:37.792 --> 01:32:40.227
but how are you guys
any different?

01:32:40.261 --> 01:32:42.797
You're just hiding here,

01:32:42.830 --> 01:32:44.932
because you don't know
what you want either.

01:32:44.965 --> 01:32:46.734
I just want
a normal relationship.

01:32:47.368 --> 01:32:48.903
No, you don't,

01:32:48.936 --> 01:32:50.304
otherwise you would have one.

01:32:51.839 --> 01:32:53.908
Well, that might be
oversimplifyin' things.

01:32:56.010 --> 01:32:57.711
Yeah.

01:32:57.745 --> 01:32:59.180
Or no, I don't think so.

01:33:03.684 --> 01:33:05.352
What's a normal
relationship anyway?

01:34:25.065 --> 01:34:26.767
I love weddings.

01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:28.335
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:34:28.369 --> 01:34:30.804
I mean I hate marriages,
but I actually love weddings.

01:34:31.372 --> 01:34:32.840
Attracts.

01:34:34.441 --> 01:34:37.111
- Oh fuck!
- What's wrong?

01:34:37.144 --> 01:34:40.347
I just realized today is
Nena and I's anniversary.

01:34:41.448 --> 01:34:42.816
Oh, my God.

01:34:42.850 --> 01:34:44.418
What are you gonna do
when she shows up?

01:34:44.451 --> 01:34:45.786
I don't know!

01:34:45.819 --> 01:34:47.488
I mean there's
a lot to consider.

01:34:47.522 --> 01:34:49.190
Oh, you said you weren't
gonna do that

01:34:49.223 --> 01:34:50.858
when it comes to
stuff like this, so...

01:34:50.891 --> 01:34:52.826
- What does your gut say?
- Okay, fine.

01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:55.262
The one thing that
I can come up with,

01:34:55.296 --> 01:34:57.298
and I guess I've been thinking
about this for a while now...

01:34:57.331 --> 01:34:58.899
But I'm pretty sure...

01:34:58.933 --> 01:35:00.801
No, fuck that,
I'm fuckin' sure.

01:35:00.834 --> 01:35:02.403
Uh-huh.

01:35:02.436 --> 01:35:03.938
I wanna get a dog.

01:35:03.971 --> 01:35:06.006
I'm gettin' a dog.

01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:07.141
- Okay.
- I'm gettin' a dog.

01:35:07.174 --> 01:35:08.375
- That is a good start.
- Okay.

01:35:16.150 --> 01:35:17.418
Are we late?

01:35:17.451 --> 01:35:19.220
Uh, I don't know.
Are we early?

01:35:19.253 --> 01:35:20.354
What is goin' on?

01:35:20.387 --> 01:35:21.789
Where is John?

01:35:22.856 --> 01:35:24.191
Is... is that John?

01:35:43.377 --> 01:35:45.379
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

01:35:51.852 --> 01:35:53.120
Wedding's off, bro.

01:35:53.153 --> 01:35:55.523
- What? Why?
- Where is Carrie?

01:35:55.557 --> 01:35:57.358
She won't come
out of the car and...

01:36:00.127 --> 01:36:01.495
I think I really fucked up.

01:37:40.227 --> 01:37:42.896
You ruined everything.

01:37:47.569 --> 01:37:48.603
How's that?

01:37:50.572 --> 01:37:53.340
We never cheated on each other
or anything, and...

01:37:53.374 --> 01:37:56.043
we have this perfect record,
and it means nothing,

01:37:56.076 --> 01:37:56.977
and you're right,

01:37:57.010 --> 01:37:58.646
getting married
isn't gonna fix anything,

01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:00.481
we made this huge mistake,
and we can't take it back,

01:38:00.515 --> 01:38:01.915
and now everything's ruined.

01:38:04.552 --> 01:38:05.953
What mistake?

01:38:07.655 --> 01:38:09.356
John thinks
I'm in love with you.

01:38:10.991 --> 01:38:12.660
Like, after the other night,

01:38:12.694 --> 01:38:15.663
all this, like, ugliness
just came pouring out of him.

01:38:16.664 --> 01:38:18.499
Like I've never seen before.

01:38:18.533 --> 01:38:20.100
Like jealousy and anger.

01:38:22.236 --> 01:38:23.270
Are you?

01:38:25.038 --> 01:38:26.073
Am I what?

01:38:27.307 --> 01:38:29.209
In love with me?

01:38:31.178 --> 01:38:33.313
I think I more just wanna,
like, be you.

01:38:34.516 --> 01:38:37.050
I, um...

01:38:37.084 --> 01:38:40.555
I can't even begin to explain
how misguided that is.

01:38:41.556 --> 01:38:43.123
But you're interesting.

01:38:43.157 --> 01:38:45.459
John and me were boring,
we have dumb fights

01:38:45.492 --> 01:38:48.095
and then we make up,
and then we have sex,

01:38:48.128 --> 01:38:50.598
and then we get takeout,
and we're boring,

01:38:50.632 --> 01:38:52.132
like I'm boring.

01:38:53.535 --> 01:38:57.304
Every relationship
is boring sometimes.

01:38:57.337 --> 01:38:59.039
There's nothing
wrong with boring

01:38:59.072 --> 01:39:00.675
as long as it's what you want.

01:39:04.011 --> 01:39:05.379
I don't know what
I want anymore.

01:39:08.449 --> 01:39:09.551
Do you love him?

01:39:13.020 --> 01:39:17.157
I do. I really, really do,

01:39:17.191 --> 01:39:19.527
but... but I just...
I don't know, like,

01:39:19.561 --> 01:39:20.994
am I gonna love him forever?

01:39:21.028 --> 01:39:22.496
Is he gonna love me forever?

01:39:22.530 --> 01:39:23.997
I just don't know.

01:39:26.333 --> 01:39:27.468
So?

01:39:37.545 --> 01:39:39.112
I'm sorry about
the other night.

01:39:41.281 --> 01:39:42.717
I don't know what
I was thinking.

01:40:14.649 --> 01:40:16.450
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:40:18.318 --> 01:40:21.388
I heard you guys had
some fun the other night.

01:40:21.421 --> 01:40:23.758
Fun isn't how I'd describe
this whole thing.

01:40:29.664 --> 01:40:32.499
Wait, look. Look.

01:40:39.439 --> 01:40:41.776
Well, I guess the wedding's back on.

01:40:45.479 --> 01:40:47.247
Or not.

01:41:20.548 --> 01:41:23.150
You think John and
Carrie will be all right?

01:41:23.183 --> 01:41:25.553
Uh, maybe, maybe not.

01:41:28.255 --> 01:41:30.157
They definitely weren't
ready today.

01:41:32.326 --> 01:41:36.129
Well, we weren't ready when
we got married either, so...

01:41:39.934 --> 01:41:41.836
I wasn't sure
about marrying you.

01:41:43.236 --> 01:41:45.339
I am sure about
being married to you.

01:41:47.842 --> 01:41:49.209
Why?

01:41:49.911 --> 01:41:51.713
Why now?

01:41:51.746 --> 01:41:53.815
Because you spent
a few days alone?

01:41:55.349 --> 01:41:56.483
Because...

01:41:59.386 --> 01:42:01.188
It's true.
I'm afraid of being alone.

01:42:01.221 --> 01:42:02.523
I'm afraid of a lot of things.

01:42:04.759 --> 01:42:06.894
But that's not why
I wanna be with you...

01:42:07.962 --> 01:42:09.363
or you.

01:42:14.936 --> 01:42:17.872
I have a lot of things
that are broken in me

01:42:17.905 --> 01:42:19.206
and you can't fix them.

01:42:19.239 --> 01:42:21.843
I won't ask you to,
either of you.

01:42:21.876 --> 01:42:24.646
You have to believe
that I want to get better,

01:42:24.679 --> 01:42:26.346
I wanna feel better,

01:42:26.380 --> 01:42:30.752
I don't wanna walk through
life in this constant panic.

01:42:32.386 --> 01:42:34.656
I've said that a lot.

01:42:34.689 --> 01:42:39.192
I want to change,
but it's fucking hard,

01:42:39.226 --> 01:42:41.696
and I'm not asking you
to fix me.

01:42:43.497 --> 01:42:46.266
I'm realizing I...
I probably need, like,

01:42:46.299 --> 01:42:48.335
legit professional help
for that.

01:42:53.407 --> 01:42:55.442
I'm only asking you to love me.

01:42:58.546 --> 01:43:02.315
I'm only asking for your
patience while I work it out.

01:43:02.349 --> 01:43:03.584
Probably a lot of patience,

01:43:03.618 --> 01:43:06.754
probably a lot more patience
than I have a right to ask for.

01:43:10.323 --> 01:43:12.259
But that's what I'm asking for.

01:43:13.761 --> 01:43:16.296
I... I don't wanna wait for...
for this to be perfect

01:43:16.329 --> 01:43:19.801
or for me to be perfect,
I want you now.

01:43:19.834 --> 01:43:21.903
But not because
I need you to fit, like,

01:43:21.936 --> 01:43:23.538
perfect pieces inside me,

01:43:23.571 --> 01:43:24.806
but because you're you.

01:43:27.374 --> 01:43:28.609
And you're you.

01:43:31.813 --> 01:43:33.447
And I want you.

01:43:35.983 --> 01:43:37.217
I want us.

01:43:58.505 --> 01:43:59.874
I want us, too.

01:44:03.443 --> 01:44:04.579
God help me.

01:44:07.515 --> 01:44:08.716
It's what I want.

01:44:24.766 --> 01:44:28.536
How about... Thai food?

01:44:33.608 --> 01:44:34.842
You guys want that?

01:44:40.114 --> 01:44:41.716
Yeah.

01:45:33.728 --> 01:45:35.564
