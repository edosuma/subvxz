11:02.963 --> 11:04.464
STOP GROWLING,
STEVE.

11:04.531 --> 11:05.465
STEVE. STEVE.

11:05.532 --> 11:06.533
GRRR!

11:06.599 --> 11:07.835
STEVE.

11:09.136 --> 11:10.670
STEVE.

11:10.738 --> 11:12.906
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
YOUR MONEY BACK.

11:12.973 --> 11:16.043
GEE, WHY ARE YOU
GOING TO DO THAT?

11:16.109 --> 11:17.745
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
KNOW THE RULES,

11:17.811 --> 11:18.812
AND YOU'RE A GUEST
IN MY HOUSE,

11:18.879 --> 11:20.347
AND I FEEL RESPONSIBLE.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.950
SO...THERE YOU GO.

11:24.317 --> 11:26.386
GEE, THANKS,
BIG GUY.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.789
YOU REALLY
ARE MY FRIEND.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.926
OKAY.
DON'T GET CRAZED.

11:33.693 --> 11:34.995
NOW GO BUY YOUR ACCORDION

11:35.062 --> 11:37.097
TAKE MY MONEY BEFORE
I REALIZE WHAT I'M DOING.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.601
THAT WAS NICE.

11:41.668 --> 11:43.536
NO, SIR.

11:43.603 --> 11:44.805
NOT UNTIL
I WIPE THE SMIRK

11:44.872 --> 11:46.807
OFF THIS
FLATFOOT'S FACE.

11:48.942 --> 11:50.177
YOU'RE COMING BACK
FOR MORE?

11:50.243 --> 11:52.212
OH, YOU BET
YOUR SWEET BILLY CLUB.

11:55.615 --> 11:57.717
STEVE,
DON'T DO THIS.

11:57.785 --> 11:59.019
WELL, WHY NOT?

11:59.086 --> 12:00.788
BECAUSE NOW YOU'LL
LOSE MY MONEY.

12:00.854 --> 12:03.490
WELL, THAT'S A RISK
I'M WILLING TO TAKE.

12:06.093 --> 12:07.460
GENTS...

12:07.527 --> 12:08.695
BELLY UP
TO THE TABLE.

12:08.762 --> 12:11.498
IT'S TIME
TO PLAY SOME
CUTTHROAT POKER.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.367
OH.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.381
MY AUNT
OWNS THE PLACE,

12:28.448 --> 12:30.851
MY SISTER WORKS HERE,
AND MY MOM HELPS OUT.

12:30.918 --> 12:33.553
THAT'S ONE OF THE RESONS
WHY I LIKE YOU, EDDIE.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.288
FAMILY'S
IMPORTANT TO YOU.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.858
YES, IT IS, LISA.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.993
MY FAMILY'S
WARM AND EMOTIONAL.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.194
THAT'S WHERE
I GET IT FROM.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.030
HARRIETTE I CANNOT
BELIEVE YOU.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.798
HOW COULD YOU TALK
TO THE COOK LIKE THAT?

12:44.865 --> 12:46.934
I ASKED RAMON
A QUESTION--

12:47.000 --> 12:48.168
IS THIS
BLACKENED CHICKEN,

12:48.235 --> 12:49.736
OR DID YOU
BURN IT AGAIN?

12:49.803 --> 12:52.039
WHO ARE
THOSE PEOPLE?

12:52.105 --> 12:54.107
I'VE NEVER
SEEN THEM BEFORE.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.476
LET'S GO GET
CHINESE, ALRIGHT?

13:00.914 --> 13:03.283
[DISHES CLATTERING]

13:03.884 --> 13:05.152
HEY, BIG MOUTH.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.120
I'M GOING BACK
TO THE TRUCK STOP

13:07.187 --> 13:09.256
WHERE RAMON
IS LOVED.

13:12.159 --> 13:14.027
LAURA,
GO TALK TO RAMON.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.195
GIVE HIM
THE USUAL SPEECH.

13:15.262 --> 13:16.796
HE'S AN ARTIST,
WE LOVE HIM...

13:16.864 --> 13:20.567
MM-HMM.

13:20.633 --> 13:21.801
BIG MISTAKE.

13:21.869 --> 13:23.636
IF RAMON'S EGO
WAS ANY BIGGER,

13:23.703 --> 13:25.172
HE WOULDN'T FIT
IN THE KITCHEN!

13:27.440 --> 13:28.741
I HEARD THAT.

13:28.808 --> 13:32.512
AND I'M REFUSING
TO TAKE ANY INSULTS

13:32.579 --> 13:35.282
FROM A LOUSY
BISCUIT SHOOTER.

13:37.851 --> 13:39.586
EITHER SHE GOES,

13:39.652 --> 13:40.620
OR I GO.

13:40.687 --> 13:42.222
WELL, IN THAT CASE,

13:42.289 --> 13:45.292
PICK UP YOUR PAYCHECK
AND HIT THE ROAD, JACK.

13:51.464 --> 13:53.566
YOU'RE FIRING
MY COOK?

13:53.633 --> 13:54.868
WELL, SOMEBODY'S
GOT TO DO IT.

13:54.935 --> 13:57.004
WAIT JUST A MINUTE,
HONEY.

13:57.070 --> 13:59.072
LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT.
LOOK AT THAT SIGN.

13:59.139 --> 14:00.740
DOES THAT SIGN SAY
"HARRIETTE'S PLACE"?

14:00.807 --> 14:01.741
NO.

14:01.808 --> 14:04.711
IT SAYS
"RACHEL'S PLACE."

14:04.777 --> 14:06.413
WHAT ARE YOU
HINTING AT?

14:07.680 --> 14:10.783
I'M HINTING THAT YOU CAN PICK UP
YOUR PAYCHECK

14:10.850 --> 14:12.585
AND HIT THE ROAD, JACK.

14:12.652 --> 14:13.620
YOU'RE FIRING ME?

14:13.686 --> 14:15.788
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE FIRED.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.525
YOU GOT A TABLE
FOR 35?

14:23.763 --> 14:25.098
HI, FELLAS.

14:26.766 --> 14:27.968
YOU'RE HIRED.

14:32.839 --> 14:34.207
I'LL BET 1.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.344
YOUR HOT STREAK'S
OVER, KID.

14:37.410 --> 14:38.912
I MAKE IT 5.

14:38.979 --> 14:40.080
I CALL.

14:40.147 --> 14:42.482
THIS CORNHUSKER'S
NO FOOL.

14:44.751 --> 14:46.719
YOUR 5..

14:46.786 --> 14:48.321
AND BUMP IT.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.356
HOW MUCH?

14:49.422 --> 14:50.790
1O MORE, DUDE.

14:50.857 --> 14:52.325
I'M OUT.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.261
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE
A PAIR OF SHOWING.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.496
NOT A POSSIBLE STRAIGHT
OR A FLUSH.

14:56.563 --> 14:57.797
YOU'RE BLUFFING KID.

14:57.864 --> 15:01.068
YOU KNOW, THOSE FLAPPING LIPS
ARE KEEPING ME COLD

15:01.134 --> 15:02.669
BUT YOU'RE WASTING MY TIME.

15:04.938 --> 15:06.974
YOUR 10...

15:07.040 --> 15:09.242
AND ANOTHER 20.

15:09.709 --> 15:11.744
MM-MMM.

15:11.811 --> 15:13.380
TOO RICH
FOR MY BLOOD.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.550
WELL, IT'S JUST
YOU AND ME, NERD.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.386
PUT UP OR SHUT UP.

15:21.721 --> 15:23.623
ALRIGHT, COPPER.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.658
I'LL PUT UP.

15:25.725 --> 15:29.029
I'LL PUT UP
EVERYTHING I'VE GOT.

15:30.630 --> 15:31.831
EVERYTHING?

15:31.898 --> 15:33.166
EVERYTHING.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.435
THE WHOLE
KICKIN' CABOODLE.

15:36.869 --> 15:38.705
BUT, STEVE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:38.771 --> 15:39.772
THAT'S OVER $200.

15:39.839 --> 15:41.975
I KNOW.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.244
WELL, I DON'T HAVE
THAT MUCH.

15:44.311 --> 15:46.980
WELL, AS MY GRANDMA
ONCE SAID

15:47.047 --> 15:48.548
WHEN SHE OVERCOOKED
HER NOOGIES,

15:48.615 --> 15:49.682
"TOUGH NOOGIES."

15:51.651 --> 15:52.986
WAIT.

15:54.854 --> 15:56.756
THIS WATCH...

15:56.823 --> 15:59.859
IS WORTH OVER $300.

15:59.926 --> 16:01.228
THE CAPTAIN
GAVE IT TO ME

16:01.294 --> 16:03.630
FOR BREAKING UP AN
ILLEGAL GAMBLING RING.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.771
ACCEPTABLE.

16:11.838 --> 16:12.972
BUT, LIEUTENANT,

16:13.040 --> 16:14.174
YOU LOVE THAT WATCH.

16:14.241 --> 16:15.508
YOU REFUSED TO SELL THAT WATCH

16:15.575 --> 16:17.344
WHEN YOUR MOTHER
NEEDED THAT OPERATION.

16:20.447 --> 16:21.814
I KNOW...

16:21.881 --> 16:24.151
BUT THIS IS POKER.

16:28.855 --> 16:30.457
WHAT YOU GOT?

16:31.691 --> 16:33.160
A FLUSH.

16:33.226 --> 16:36.329
DIAMONDS ARE
A COP'S BEST FRIEND.

16:38.698 --> 16:41.901
AND ALL I HAVE
IS TWO PAIR.

16:41.968 --> 16:43.770
YES! I WIN!

16:43.836 --> 16:45.072
AH-AH-AH-AH-AH-AH.

16:51.811 --> 16:54.481
TWO PAIR OF 10s.

16:54.547 --> 16:56.416
FOUR 10s.

16:57.984 --> 17:00.120
ALRIGHT!

17:01.988 --> 17:03.123
FOUR 10s?

17:03.190 --> 17:05.592
FOUR 10s. YOU LOSE.

17:05.658 --> 17:07.060
FOUR 10s?

17:07.127 --> 17:08.961
YOU LOSE.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.730
FOUR 10s?

17:10.797 --> 17:11.798
YOU LOSE.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.066
YOU SEE,

17:13.133 --> 17:15.268
ANYWAY YOU SAY IT,
YOU LOSE.

17:21.007 --> 17:22.575
BYE, GUYS!

17:22.642 --> 17:23.743
GOOD LUCK NEXT WEEK.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.278
COME AGAIN.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.814
OHH.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.015
OOH.

17:29.082 --> 17:30.550
OHH.

17:30.617 --> 17:34.354
THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS COULD
BE SO HARD ON THE HOOVES.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.489
YEAH, BUT THE TIPS
MAKE UP FOR IT.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.258
YES. A NICE SMILE,

17:38.325 --> 17:41.294
AND YOU'LL GO HOME
WITH YOUR POCKETS FULL.

17:41.361 --> 17:42.429
HOW DID YOU
DO TONIGHT?

17:42.495 --> 17:45.465
38 BUCKS.
HOW ABOUT
YOU, MOM?

17:49.001 --> 17:50.036
MOM.

17:50.103 --> 17:52.372
$4.13...

17:52.439 --> 17:55.342
AND A HALF A STICK
OF CHEWING GUM.

17:55.408 --> 17:58.010
LAURA, WOULD YOU MIND
GIVING RAMON

17:58.077 --> 17:59.979
HIS USUAL
GOODNIGHT PEP TALK?

18:00.046 --> 18:01.914
YOU'RE A GENIUS,
YOU'RE A GOD,

18:01.981 --> 18:05.352
YOU SAVED
OUR BUTTS AGAIN.

18:05.418 --> 18:06.686
OH, BOY.

18:06.753 --> 18:07.687
RACHEL.

18:07.754 --> 18:08.721
YEAH?

18:08.788 --> 18:10.690
I OWE YOU
AN APOLOGY.

18:10.757 --> 18:11.958
YES, YOU DO.

18:12.024 --> 18:14.227
THIS IS YOUR RESTAURANT
AND YOU SHOULD RUN IT

18:14.294 --> 18:16.296
WITH NO INTERFERENCE
FROM ME.

18:16.363 --> 18:18.030
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:18.097 --> 18:19.098
WHAT?

18:19.166 --> 18:22.235
YOU'RE REALLY GOOD
AT IT.

18:22.302 --> 18:23.270
YOU REALLY THINK SO?

18:23.336 --> 18:25.872
NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE IT.

18:25.938 --> 18:29.008
A FEW MINUTES AGO,
THIS PLACE WAS A MADHOUSE,

18:29.075 --> 18:31.944
BUT YOU WERE CALM, COOL,
AND IN CONTROL.

18:32.011 --> 18:34.113
YOU DEALT WITH
A HUNGRY MOB,

18:34.181 --> 18:36.383
A CRAZY COOK,

18:36.449 --> 18:38.918
AND A BIG MOUTH
PUSHY SISTER

18:38.985 --> 18:40.687
WHO THINKS SHE
KNOWS EVERYTHING.

18:42.222 --> 18:44.224
WAIT A MINUTE.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.693
A COMPLIMENT
FROM YOU?

18:46.759 --> 18:48.161
WHAT'S THE CATCH?

18:48.228 --> 18:50.197
NO CATCH.

18:51.831 --> 18:53.433
YOU KNOW, RACHEL...

18:54.367 --> 18:57.570
AS FAR BACK
AS I CAN REMEMBER,

18:57.637 --> 19:00.407
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
THE BIG SISTER

19:00.473 --> 19:03.443
LOOKING OUT FOR
MY LITTLE SISTER.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.245
BUT SOMEWHERE
ALONG THE LINE,

19:05.312 --> 19:08.215
YOU STARTED
LOOKING OUT
FOR YOURSELF...

19:08.281 --> 19:09.982
YOURSELF.

19:10.049 --> 19:12.452
I'M PROUD OF YOU,
RACHEL.

19:12.519 --> 19:13.653
YOU KNOW,

19:13.720 --> 19:15.788
I'M JUST LUCKY
I HAD A BIG SISTER

19:15.855 --> 19:19.058
WHO TAUGHT ME HOW TO
LOOK OUT FOR MYSELF...

19:19.125 --> 19:21.561
MYSELF.

19:21.628 --> 19:24.063
THANK YOU FOR ALWAYS
BEING THERE FOR ME.

19:24.130 --> 19:26.233
I COULDN'T HAVE
A BETTER SISTER.

19:26.299 --> 19:28.167
OH, RACHEL.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.809
FOUR 10's.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.882
UH, LIEUTENANT.

19:42.949 --> 19:43.950
HMM? WHAT?

19:44.016 --> 19:45.218
IT'S LATE.

19:45.285 --> 19:47.587
DON'T YOU THINK WE
BETTER CALL IT A NIGHT?

19:47.654 --> 19:49.789
YEAH. SURE.

19:52.292 --> 19:53.926
FOUR 10's.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.499
HEY, LIEU.

19:59.566 --> 20:00.767
YEAH?

20:00.833 --> 20:02.769
YOU FORGOT
SOMETHING.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.342
WHAT'S THIS FOR?

20:11.210 --> 20:12.745
WELL, UNLIKE YOU,

20:12.812 --> 20:14.347
I PLAY FOR FUN.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.250
I REALLY GET
TO KEEP THIS?

20:17.317 --> 20:19.319
WELL, AS
LADY CHATTERLEY SAID

20:19.386 --> 20:21.254
TO ALL
OF HER LOVERS,

20:21.321 --> 20:22.689
"SURE. WHY NOT?"

20:30.863 --> 20:32.299
YOU'RE ALRIGHT, KID.

20:42.309 --> 20:44.010
THAT WAS NICE,
STEVE.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.111
REAL CLASSY.

20:45.177 --> 20:47.113
OH, THANKS,
BIG GUY.

20:47.179 --> 20:48.981
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
WOULD BE CLASSIER?

20:49.048 --> 20:50.016
WHAT?

20:50.082 --> 20:51.951
IF YOU GIVE ME
MY MONEY BACK.

20:52.018 --> 20:54.020
OH, SURE.
IT'S RIGHT HERE.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.790
WELL, THANKS, STEVE.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.025
HEY, AND LISTEN,

20:59.091 --> 21:00.793
I'M GOING TO
GIVE UP GAMBLING,

21:00.860 --> 21:02.028
BUT BEFORE I DO,

21:02.094 --> 21:05.598
HOW ABOUT
ONE LAST WAGER?

21:05.665 --> 21:07.133
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
IN MIND?

21:07.199 --> 21:09.201
WELL...

21:09.268 --> 21:10.470
WE CUT THE DECK.

21:10.537 --> 21:11.804
IF I GET
THE HIGH CARD,

21:11.871 --> 21:15.007
I CAN COME OVER HERE
ANYTIME I WANT.

21:17.344 --> 21:20.046
WHAT DO I GET IF
I GET THE HIGH CARD?

21:20.112 --> 21:23.716
I STAY AWAY
FOR A...MONTH.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.318
SIX MONTHS.

21:27.153 --> 21:28.888
YOU'RE ON.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.995
OH, NO.

21:36.062 --> 21:37.530
A 3.

21:38.698 --> 21:40.567
AHEM.

21:46.939 --> 21:48.575
AH. DEUCE. YOU WIN.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.242
ALRIGHT.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.144
HEY, NO HARD FEELINGS,
BIG GUY.

21:52.211 --> 21:54.414
NAH. FAIR IS FAIR,
STEVE.
