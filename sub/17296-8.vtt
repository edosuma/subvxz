And so it begins.

00:31.031 --> 00:34.382
Titans, it's Crime Season!

00:34.425 --> 00:36.253
Is there anything
better than competing

00:36.297 --> 00:39.517
with other superhero teams
to stop the most crimes,

00:39.561 --> 00:41.345
and smashing them into the dirt?

00:41.389 --> 00:43.826
The answer is "No!"

00:43.869 --> 00:46.220
I thought we just finished
Crime Season.

00:46.263 --> 00:47.699
We did, two weeks ago.

00:47.743 --> 00:50.920
This is an all new season
of crimes to stop.

00:50.963 --> 00:54.054
But we're so tired, dude.

00:54.097 --> 00:55.490
I feel like we've earned
a hiatus.

00:55.533 --> 00:58.536
It has been ages
since I said hello to my atus.

00:58.580 --> 01:00.930
The Teen Titans
do not go on hiatus.

01:00.973 --> 01:03.846
But other superhero teams
go on hiatus all the time.

01:03.889 --> 01:07.328
And that's why they always
lose Crime Season to us.

01:07.371 --> 01:09.895
Uh, crime fighting
isn't a sport, Robin.

01:09.939 --> 01:11.332
Of course it is. In fact,

01:11.375 --> 01:13.812
it is one of America's
greatest sports,

01:13.856 --> 01:15.292
in which superhero teams

01:15.336 --> 01:17.599
consisting of no less
than three members

01:17.642 --> 01:19.905
compete to see
who will be the first

01:19.949 --> 01:22.082
to stop 52 crimes!

01:23.648 --> 01:26.477
I thought crime fighting
was about justice or whatever.

01:27.174 --> 01:28.566
Wrong!

01:28.610 --> 01:30.916
The Teen Titans
have won Crime Season

01:30.960 --> 01:32.222
three years in a row.

01:32.266 --> 01:34.181
We've got to keep
that streak alive.

01:34.224 --> 01:36.618
But we do not care
about the streak.

01:36.661 --> 01:37.836
Really?

01:37.880 --> 01:39.447
Because if we won again,

01:39.490 --> 01:42.014
I was going to throw you all
a pizza party.

01:43.364 --> 01:45.583
That you'll have to pay for.

01:45.627 --> 01:48.760
I knew you would be excited.
Now, let's get out there.

01:48.804 --> 01:50.588
Titans, go!

01:50.632 --> 01:53.156
Prepare yourselves, Titans,
and remember,

01:53.200 --> 01:55.854
together, we are unstoppable.

01:55.898 --> 01:58.466
- Hey, Titans!
- Oh, wha... Kid Flash?

01:58.509 --> 02:00.903
I haven't seen you since
I beat you in that foot race,

02:00.946 --> 02:02.948
- fair and square.
- You mean when you cheated.

02:02.992 --> 02:04.950
What is... What is that? What are you doing?

02:04.994 --> 02:06.474
Mmm. Sorry, excuse me.

02:06.517 --> 02:09.259
I'm just, uh, enjoying
these sour grapes you brought.

02:09.303 --> 02:11.131
♪ What you got there, sour grapes? ♪

02:11.174 --> 02:13.307
♪ You got a grip of sour grapes ♪

02:48.516 --> 02:51.606
So what are you doing here?

02:51.649 --> 02:54.478
Competing. I'm gonna win
Crime Season this year.

02:54.522 --> 02:55.958
But you don't have a team.

02:56.001 --> 02:58.221
Don't need one.
Super speed, remember?

02:58.265 --> 02:59.657
I can do it all myself.

02:59.701 --> 03:01.224
Boom! Just stopped 10 crimes.

03:01.268 --> 03:03.792
- Okay, that doesn't count...
- Ten more! That makes 20.

03:03.835 --> 03:06.229
- As I said, that does not c...
- 46!

03:06.273 --> 03:07.752
- You can't do that!
- 52.

03:07.796 --> 03:10.102
I win. Wow, that was...
It was really just easy.

03:10.146 --> 03:14.194
This is Crime Season!
Stop fighting crime!

03:14.237 --> 03:15.891
You need to be
on a team to compete.

03:15.934 --> 03:18.023
And you do not belong
to any team.

03:18.067 --> 03:20.939
Okay, no problem.
I'll just start my own team

03:20.983 --> 03:22.376
and stop 52 more.

03:22.419 --> 03:23.855
Ha! Good luck with that.

03:23.899 --> 03:25.814
All the good heroes
are already on teams.

03:25.857 --> 03:27.424
Even I could barely find anyone.

03:27.468 --> 03:28.686
These guys were the bottom
of the barrel.

03:28.730 --> 03:30.775
Hey! What's that
supposed to mean?

03:30.819 --> 03:33.169
Ooh, it is the highest
of the compliments.

03:33.213 --> 03:36.346
Only the good things are found
at the bottoms of barrels,

03:36.390 --> 03:38.087
because of the gravity.

03:38.130 --> 03:40.698
Bottom of the barrel, baby!

03:40.742 --> 03:43.788
There must be some solo heroes
out there looking to join a team.

03:43.832 --> 03:46.356
Doubt it!
Now, if you'll excuse us,

03:46.400 --> 03:49.272
we have to go
win Crime Season again.

03:49.316 --> 03:50.621
Titans, go!

04:44.545 --> 04:45.937
Great job out there, Titans.

04:45.981 --> 04:47.809
We're one crime away
from that pizza party

04:47.852 --> 04:51.421
you guys have to pay for.

04:51.465 --> 04:53.945
So many crimes.

04:53.989 --> 04:57.775
Ahh, you finish one, and then
you think you can rest, but no.

04:57.819 --> 04:59.951
Boom! You have
to fight another crime.

04:59.995 --> 05:02.171
Well, I'm done
with catching bad guys!

05:02.214 --> 05:04.304
I wanna catch some Z's.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.352
Titans!

05:09.396 --> 05:10.658
Come on, keep it together!

05:10.701 --> 05:12.703
Look, we're at 51 crimes.

05:12.747 --> 05:14.662
One more,
and we win Crime Season.

05:14.705 --> 05:17.273
The streak stays alive, and you
can all take two weeks off.

05:17.317 --> 05:21.016
Resting or spending time with
the wife and kids or whatever.

05:22.583 --> 05:23.758
Wake up!

05:23.801 --> 05:25.890
Aw, man, every time we wake up,

05:25.934 --> 05:27.370
he's still there.

05:27.414 --> 05:29.416
I've already thrown out my
back fighting all this crime.

05:29.459 --> 05:32.419
Why are we killing ourselves to
win this competition, Robin?

05:32.462 --> 05:35.465
The streak. Don't you care
about the streak?

05:35.509 --> 05:37.685
- No.
- Well, I do.

05:37.728 --> 05:39.469
- Hey, guys.
- wha...

05:39.513 --> 05:40.862
What are you doing here?

05:40.905 --> 05:42.472
I just wanted to say
you were right.

05:42.516 --> 05:44.561
I couldn't find any solo
heroes to join my team.

05:44.605 --> 05:47.129
Ohh, more sour grapes.

05:47.172 --> 05:49.349
Looks like you brought
enough for everybody.

05:50.872 --> 05:52.613
Ew, dude.

05:52.656 --> 05:54.049
Where'd you get all those rotten grapes from?

05:54.092 --> 05:55.355
Mmm.

05:56.573 --> 05:58.358
Oh, they're as sour as ever.

05:58.401 --> 05:59.402
Disgusting!

05:59.446 --> 06:01.099
Mmm, come on, guys.

06:01.143 --> 06:04.451
Eat the sour grapes Kid Flash
so graciously brought us.

06:04.494 --> 06:06.366
Ugh! Get those away from me.

06:07.715 --> 06:09.760
Mmm. Mmm! Ah, well,

06:11.632 --> 06:14.374
looks like the Teen Titans have
got this Crime Season in the bag.

06:14.417 --> 06:15.940
Oh, I didn't say
I was giving up.

06:15.984 --> 06:18.203
I just need to recruit heroes
that are already on teams.

06:18.247 --> 06:22.425
Mmm, and why, uh, would
anyone leave their team

06:22.469 --> 06:23.818
- to join yours?
- I don't know.

06:23.861 --> 06:26.298
Maybe they're feeling
unappreciated.

06:26.342 --> 06:27.474
Boo-yeah!

06:27.517 --> 06:29.954
Or maybe they're overworked.

06:29.998 --> 06:32.827
Hey, you fixed my back.

06:32.870 --> 06:34.872
Or perhaps they would enjoy some

06:34.916 --> 06:36.700
quality of life improvements.

06:36.744 --> 06:38.789
Ah, the chair of lounging.

06:38.833 --> 06:41.575
Ooh, ooh! What do I get,
Kid Flashy Flash?

06:44.752 --> 06:47.319
Not to mention, on my team,
I do all the work.

06:47.363 --> 06:49.887
After all, I only need teammates
to qualify for Crime Season.

06:49.931 --> 06:51.454
Sounds pretty good to me.

06:53.282 --> 06:54.805
Wait a second.

06:57.112 --> 06:58.113
Hiya!

06:59.593 --> 07:01.072
Hey.

07:01.116 --> 07:03.205
You didn't just come here
to deliver sour grapes.

07:03.248 --> 07:05.076
You're here to poach my team.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.557
I would never, unless they
were interested, of course.

07:07.601 --> 07:09.559
- Oh, we're interested!
- Very interested!

07:09.603 --> 07:10.908
What? Guys,

07:10.952 --> 07:13.215
we're the number one
superhero team.

07:13.258 --> 07:15.783
- Three years running.
- Yeah, but pizza!

07:15.826 --> 07:18.481
- Back rubs.
- The chair of comfort.

07:18.525 --> 07:19.917
Uh, being ignored?

07:19.961 --> 07:21.658
- So that's a yes?
- It's a no.

07:21.702 --> 07:23.312
I'd say it's a probably.

07:23.355 --> 07:24.574
Are you serious?

07:24.618 --> 07:26.097
I gave you
your first opportunity

07:26.141 --> 07:28.448
to be superheroes
when no one else would.

07:28.491 --> 07:30.885
What happened to loyalty?

07:30.928 --> 07:34.105
The truth is, I can't
do this without you.

07:34.149 --> 07:37.152
The villains we've stopped,
the cities we've saved.

07:37.195 --> 07:38.675
It's because of you.

07:38.719 --> 07:42.462
Titans, please don't leave.
I need you.

07:42.505 --> 07:43.941
You know what, bro?

07:43.985 --> 07:46.074
It may be absolutely
terrible to work here,

07:46.117 --> 07:48.293
but we're not gonna go anywhere.

07:49.643 --> 07:51.209
This is it.

07:51.253 --> 07:53.211
Our 52nd crime.

07:53.255 --> 07:56.127
We just need to foil it
to win Crime Season.

07:56.171 --> 07:58.129
And continue the streak.

07:58.173 --> 07:59.522
Titans, go!

08:10.620 --> 08:11.882
This is so cool.

08:11.926 --> 08:13.928
What a perfect way
to end Crime Season.

08:13.971 --> 08:17.627
An epic battle on a train.

08:17.671 --> 08:19.150
Can we just get this over with?

08:19.194 --> 08:22.502
But aren't you excited
about the train?

08:23.024 --> 08:24.242
No.

08:24.286 --> 08:26.810
Fine. Titans,
stop Killer Moth

08:26.854 --> 08:28.856
before he gets
the toxic waste he's after.

08:28.899 --> 08:32.076
This isn't my first
train fight, Titans.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.513
You'll never defeat me.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.069
Too late, Titans.

09:09.418 --> 09:11.072
Now grow, my pet.

09:11.507 --> 09:12.987
Whee!

09:13.030 --> 09:15.555
Grow!

09:22.997 --> 09:26.391
Oh, crime season is the worst!

09:26.435 --> 09:27.828
We can still defeat it, Titans.

09:27.871 --> 09:29.699
We just need
to attack it together.

09:29.743 --> 09:31.527
Come on, let's do it.

09:33.703 --> 09:35.183
Hey, Titans.

09:36.445 --> 09:38.055
Is that a party bus?

09:38.099 --> 09:40.667
With a tub
of the hot comfort bubbles?

09:40.710 --> 09:43.104
That party bus is on fleek, yo!

09:43.147 --> 09:46.107
That's it. I'm joining
Kid Flash's team.

09:46.150 --> 09:47.412
The me, too.

09:47.456 --> 09:49.023
What? You can't leave now.

09:49.066 --> 09:50.938
In the middle of Crime Season,
in the middle of a crime?

09:50.981 --> 09:53.070
Come on, let's just
finish off Killer Moth

09:53.114 --> 09:55.595
and his giant mutant...
Whatever that is.

09:57.466 --> 10:00.512
- Ah, nope.
- No, thank you.

10:00.556 --> 10:02.689
You two won't leave me
in my time of need, will you?

10:02.732 --> 10:05.692
I would but I don't think
he wants me.

10:05.735 --> 10:07.345
Bro, you gave me a shot

10:07.389 --> 10:09.260
and believed in me,
when no one else did.

10:09.304 --> 10:11.132
I'd be a monster
to leave you now.

10:11.175 --> 10:12.133
Thank you, Cyborg.

10:12.176 --> 10:13.700
- That means so much...
- Psych!

10:16.572 --> 10:18.966
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo,
I like hot tub!

10:19.662 --> 10:20.968
Stay strong, Beast Boy.

10:21.011 --> 10:23.492
We can still do this if...

10:23.535 --> 10:25.320
Well done, my pet.

10:25.363 --> 10:27.627
Now to destroy Jump City!

10:28.453 --> 10:31.326
Sour grapes!
