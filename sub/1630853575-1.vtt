Little something for the wifey?

01:56.812 --> 01:58.335
Yeah, I just stopped off.

01:58.379 --> 02:00.163
So how does the missus
like my neighborhood?

02:00.207 --> 02:03.210
- Oh, she's on cloud nine.
- Ah...

02:07.866 --> 02:09.694
Whoo-hoo! Oh...

02:09.738 --> 02:11.218
It's... it's sleek.

02:12.436 --> 02:14.134
She's quite a possession.

She is.

Uh, Mr. Banner,

02:18.312 --> 02:20.792
I probably shouldn't keep,
uh, Joanne waiting.

02:20.836 --> 02:22.707
- Mm-hm.
- Excuse me.

02:23.360 --> 02:24.753
Alright...

02:31.716 --> 02:32.674
Hi, doll.

02:32.717 --> 02:33.936
What took you so long?

02:34.980 --> 02:37.505
Frederick... Banner.

02:39.550 --> 02:41.639
He cornered me again.

02:41.683 --> 02:44.076
He's off.

02:44.120 --> 02:46.818
I caught him staring at me
while I was in the garden
the other day.

02:48.342 --> 02:50.344
What?!

02:50.387 --> 02:53.434
Joanne, I said I didn't want you
to speak to him.

02:53.477 --> 02:54.913
Seriously.

02:56.219 --> 02:58.569
- How was your day?
- It was okay.

02:58.613 --> 03:02.225
I wish I was out and about
like you, having adventures.

03:02.269 --> 03:05.620
- I did get you something.
- You shouldn't have.

03:05.663 --> 03:09.014
Did you get me a new drill
to fix the dishwasher?

03:10.364 --> 03:12.061
- No...

03:12.104 --> 03:13.497
You got me books.

03:13.541 --> 03:16.065
Did you find a copy
of the Naked Lunch?

03:16.108 --> 03:17.327
Open it.

03:22.463 --> 03:24.247
Nope.

03:24.291 --> 03:25.422
Undies.

Come on, Joanne,
don't be a wet rag.

03:31.298 --> 03:33.169
Go put 'em on.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.432
Am I just here
for your amusement?

03:37.782 --> 03:39.001
Sometimes.

07:53.516 --> 07:55.910
The National Weather Service
says that tonight

07:55.953 --> 07:57.694
the Southland will be able
to witness

Frederick Banner inspired me

going into medicine, Tom?

Oh, he faints
at the sight of blood.

08:16.147 --> 08:19.368
Mm. I couldn't stare death
square in the face.

08:19.411 --> 08:21.501
Not like you superheroes.

08:21.544 --> 08:23.764
So, Tom, you're thinking of,
uh, relocating your practice?

08:25.505 --> 08:27.985
We're still
working out the details.

08:32.076 --> 08:33.513

stuck in a house...

more interested in my heels

- Order food.
- Yes, Doctor.

18:54.611 --> 18:56.135

20:26.834 --> 20:29.097
What's so strange about him?

20:29.140 --> 20:31.404
Just the way he looks at me.

20:31.447 --> 20:34.755
I can't put it into words, man.
But I'm telling you bro, like--

20:34.798 --> 20:36.931
Sleep with one eye open.

20:36.974 --> 20:39.238
Okay, I'll tell him you said hi.

20:39.281 --> 20:42.241
Bon appetite.

21:00.346 --> 21:02.696
- Hello.
- Hello. Thank you.

21:02.739 --> 21:03.784
You're welcome.

21:07.570 --> 21:09.572
Let's build a fire
tomorrow night.

21:09.616 --> 21:11.661
Crack open
one of Eldridge's bottles

21:11.705 --> 21:15.535
and watch this eclipse
everyone keeps talking about.

21:20.104 --> 21:21.497
You're really taking his

21:21.541 --> 21:23.325
"make yourself comfortable"
seriously.

21:23.369 --> 21:25.284
Mm.

21:54.182 --> 21:55.836
A fucking flat?

22:08.936 --> 22:10.372
Eldridge?

22:14.202 --> 22:15.725
No one can know.

22:19.207 --> 22:20.817
Will you look around
for new places for sale?

22:25.431 --> 22:26.997
Is there something
you wanna say?

22:36.442 --> 22:37.617
Hey...

22:40.054 --> 22:41.098
Honey...

22:47.453 --> 22:50.369
Oh, come on, you don't have to
be at the hospital until- 00.

22:52.849 --> 22:55.722
Hey, I didn't say no.

22:57.506 --> 22:59.203
There's just...

23:01.728 --> 23:04.557
There's a lot to consider,
you know.

23:04.600 --> 23:08.343
Grams used to say,
"Love is showing up
and sticking around."

23:14.828 --> 23:15.829
Hey...

23:17.700 --> 23:18.875
I...

23:20.007 --> 23:21.704
Show up and stick around.

24:29.163 --> 24:30.207
Hello?

24:33.733 --> 24:35.038
Wow...

24:44.047 --> 24:45.440
Jesus.

25:28.831 --> 25:30.441
Frederick Banner.

25:52.028 --> 25:54.465
Was San Diego worse than here?

25:56.119 --> 25:58.426
I held a lot of hands
in their final minutes.

25:58.469 --> 25:59.688
Hm.

26:01.951 --> 26:04.998
But the hard part
was our Head of Trauma.

26:08.262 --> 26:09.611
Couldn't keep his hands off me.

26:09.655 --> 26:11.482
- Yeah.

26:11.526 --> 26:15.225
We've all been there.
But honestly not at this job.

26:16.531 --> 26:18.446
Would that affect
your decision?

26:21.101 --> 26:23.625
Tom would rather me
start a family than work.

26:23.669 --> 26:26.802
Hal, too.

26:28.587 --> 26:29.979
He's been trying
to get me pregnant,

26:30.023 --> 26:32.112
but I have lupus.

26:38.074 --> 26:41.208
Sticking up for yourself in
a relationship never feels good.

26:41.251 --> 26:44.864
Yeah. I mean, Hal comes from
a dysfunctional family

26:44.907 --> 26:46.648
- and wants a "do over".
- Mm.

26:46.692 --> 26:47.954
And he's convinced himself

26:47.997 --> 26:49.912
that we both want
the same thing.

26:51.131 --> 26:52.480
You have family?

26:54.003 --> 26:55.875
Mine passed.

26:55.918 --> 26:58.704
Uh, but Tom
has family in Arizona.

26:58.747 --> 27:00.053
Mm.

27:01.054 --> 27:02.838
How's the Banner house?

27:02.882 --> 27:05.754
I mean, Hal thought that would,
you know, convince Tom.

27:05.798 --> 27:08.757
Uh, no, the home rent thing
worked out great.

27:09.802 --> 27:11.978
It's perfect for Tom.

27:12.021 --> 27:14.937
'Course I'd be more comfortable
pretending it's not 1955.

27:14.981 --> 27:17.810
No!
I mean, I sure as shit
don't wanna go back.

27:17.853 --> 27:20.464
- I am way too into
my birth control pill.

27:20.508 --> 27:22.379
Yeah.

28:03.246 --> 28:04.944
"The missing husbands
of Mandarin."

28:28.794 --> 28:30.709
I'm leaving any minute now.

28:30.752 --> 28:32.275
Yeah, I figured
you'd still be there.

28:32.319 --> 28:34.756
Beverly Gordon
has called twice.

28:34.800 --> 28:39.239
Listen... I need a favor.

28:39.282 --> 28:42.416
Are you procrastinating
or did you miss me?

28:42.459 --> 28:45.158
If I tell you I miss you
will you do me the favor?

28:46.594 --> 28:47.813
I need you to look for a book

28:47.856 --> 28:49.858
with the orange binding.

28:49.902 --> 28:51.773
You're procrastinating.

28:51.817 --> 28:55.777
Why can't we just Wikipedia him
like normal people?

28:55.821 --> 28:58.432
I did. A lot was missing.

28:58.475 --> 29:00.129
Beverly Gordon
is going to kill you

29:00.173 --> 29:03.350
if you don't finish her plans.

29:03.393 --> 29:06.657
The Strange Life
of Frederick Banner.

29:06.701 --> 29:08.921
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, that's it.

29:09.922 --> 29:11.532
Now I remember there being, um,

29:11.575 --> 29:13.273
a lot of photos
of Banner in his home.

29:13.316 --> 29:16.755
There are a lot of photos
in front of houses.

29:16.798 --> 29:18.408
Okay. Well, look for a photo

29:18.452 --> 29:21.890
of him standing in front of
an old Ford Thunderbird.

29:27.026 --> 29:29.028
This is probably it.

29:29.071 --> 29:30.725
What's the address of the house?

29:31.857 --> 29:33.902
1960 Marion Lane.

29:35.991 --> 29:37.514
I knew it.

29:38.951 --> 29:41.257
I'm in his actual house.

29:42.998 --> 29:45.087
What's it like?

29:45.131 --> 29:48.221
Well, it's like
stepping back in time.

29:48.264 --> 29:53.313
Only... smaller than I thought,
but lived in.

29:54.444 --> 29:55.924
Probably died in, too.

29:55.968 --> 29:57.578
Flip to the table of contents.

29:57.621 --> 29:59.928
I-I remember reading
years ago that Banner

29:59.972 --> 30:02.278
was obsessed with the occult.

30:03.497 --> 30:04.324
You don't pay me enough

30:04.367 --> 30:05.847
to read the whole goddamn book

30:05.891 --> 30:06.979
on a Friday night.

30:07.022 --> 30:08.241
Hannah, Just find the chapter

30:08.284 --> 30:09.808
and what was so strange
about the dude.

30:11.244 --> 30:14.682
Okay, um... His wife Alice

30:14.725 --> 30:19.295
disappeared under mysterious
circumstances in 1958.

30:19.339 --> 30:22.995
- Her name was Alice?
- Looks like it.

30:23.038 --> 30:25.562
Uh, rumors he was polygamist.

30:25.606 --> 30:27.782
He was technically
married twice.

30:27.826 --> 30:31.873
Second time
to a Joanne Waxtan-Banner
until his death in '83.

30:33.092 --> 30:34.658
How did Banner die?

30:34.702 --> 30:36.530
Um, at home.

30:36.573 --> 30:39.838
His wife died
from a heart attack
a month later in the same house.

30:39.881 --> 30:42.231
His young son
went into foster care.

30:44.016 --> 30:45.800
A chunk of this
is about Emil Larson

30:45.844 --> 30:47.846
and his influence on Banner.

30:47.889 --> 30:50.805
Well, Larson
looks super sketch.

30:50.849 --> 30:53.068
You should see his paintings.

30:53.112 --> 30:55.244
Contemporaries said
Larson and Banner

30:55.288 --> 31:00.075
started a secret society,
The Brotherhood
of the Orange King.

31:00.119 --> 31:04.601
Blah, blah, blah.
Some garbage called
"human transmutation".

31:04.645 --> 31:06.821
"To bring forth
an immortal being."

31:06.865 --> 31:09.258
Look...

31:09.302 --> 31:11.957
These guys
were obviously bananas.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.349
Can I go now?

31:13.393 --> 31:16.918
No. Um, um...
Send me all the photographs

31:16.962 --> 31:19.573
in that book of Banner
with women. Okay?

31:19.616 --> 31:22.576
I'm missing happy hour.

31:22.619 --> 31:24.708
Well, in a few minutes
you can bounce.

31:27.450 --> 31:29.757
How's it going?
You kill Alice yet?

31:31.585 --> 31:33.630
I think they're gonna
offer her the job.

31:34.805 --> 31:36.546
So...

31:36.590 --> 31:38.897
what do that mean for us?

31:40.681 --> 31:42.552
Well...

31:42.596 --> 31:44.946
I guess I have to consider

31:44.990 --> 31:48.558
becoming a Mandarin County
housewife.

31:49.603 --> 31:51.866
Want a change of scenery?

31:51.910 --> 31:54.434
I thought things weren't
going well between you two?

31:58.177 --> 32:00.396
Sometimes you have to
make sacrifices.

32:02.268 --> 32:03.878
Sounds like you're done with me.

32:04.923 --> 32:07.403
Finish the Gordon project.

32:31.645 --> 32:35.040
Multiple wives, multiple lives.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.396
Eldridge.

32:54.189 --> 32:55.974
Marie Verdin.

33:23.958 --> 33:26.395
Prep bay five.
Grab two units of O negative.

33:26.439 --> 33:29.181
Patient found in vehicle
with multiple stab wounds
to the neck and abdomen.

33:29.224 --> 33:30.834
- Total blood loss?
- There were two liters left

33:30.878 --> 33:33.489
- on the floor of the ambulance.
- Let's move.

33:39.582 --> 33:41.280
He's lost too much blood.

33:42.803 --> 33:45.501
The dude said,
"No one can know"...

34:13.486 --> 34:17.707
Oh, a seamless integration
of indoor and outdoor space.

34:17.751 --> 34:20.188
I see you were inspired by
Frederick Banner.

34:21.494 --> 34:23.626
That's right, Ms. Gordon.

34:23.670 --> 34:26.542
Banner Homes
are built for entertaining.

34:26.586 --> 34:28.327
Yes, well,
I'm looking for something

34:28.370 --> 34:32.766
that lasts for more than
just a handful of parties.

34:32.809 --> 34:36.030
I need something that will
last for decades.

34:36.074 --> 34:39.686
An iconic home,
that generations from now

34:39.729 --> 34:43.124
will stand out
as a true achievement.

34:43.168 --> 34:46.910
Mr. Levin,
I motivate people for a living.

34:46.954 --> 34:49.348
Clearly you knew
what you were getting into.

34:49.391 --> 34:52.525
I appreciate
your patience, ma'am.

34:54.440 --> 34:57.530
Maybe I'm just, uh,
the wrong guy for the job.

34:57.573 --> 35:00.141
Don't give me that.
Now you haven't lived

35:00.185 --> 35:03.144
until you've created something
that will last.

35:03.188 --> 35:06.669
Ms. Gordon,
we would be more than happy
to reassess the property.

35:09.977 --> 35:11.457
Were you really
under the impression

35:11.500 --> 35:13.502
I was spending
ten million dollars

35:13.546 --> 35:15.983
to have a place
to stuff my furniture?

35:17.506 --> 35:19.682
Look at your initial proposal.

35:19.726 --> 35:23.643
And read the Warhol quote
you included!

35:23.686 --> 35:26.298
"The idea isn't to live forever,

35:26.341 --> 35:29.127
but to create something
that will."

35:29.997 --> 35:31.303
You feel me?

35:59.548 --> 36:01.637
Oh, I must be losing my shit.

36:13.040 --> 36:14.737
Oh, what the fuck?!

36:50.251 --> 36:52.340
Hi, this is Dr. Alice Dodgeson.

36:52.384 --> 36:56.257
If this is a medical emergency
please hang up and dial 911.

37:14.884 --> 37:16.669
I'm gone. Headed to the Gaslamp.

37:16.712 --> 37:19.846
Hey, look...

37:21.021 --> 37:23.023
I just wanted to apologize.

37:23.850 --> 37:25.068
You sounded mad.

37:25.112 --> 37:26.722
So this is just a job for me?

37:27.636 --> 37:29.899
Hannah...

37:29.943 --> 37:34.600
I think we have a
great working relationship.

37:35.905 --> 37:37.342
And so what I'm trying to say--

37:37.385 --> 37:40.345
Think about someone
besides yourself for once.

37:45.654 --> 37:48.396
I think I saw someone
in this house.

37:48.440 --> 37:50.224
I've got two martinis waiting.

38:13.116 --> 38:14.901
I noticed your tire's low.

38:14.944 --> 38:17.033
I know that it's low.
Thanks.

38:21.690 --> 38:23.170
No one can know.

38:24.606 --> 38:25.999
Excuse me?

39:12.785 --> 39:14.439
Alice.

39:14.482 --> 39:16.702
Kerri told me
about that patient.

39:16.745 --> 39:18.486
I'm so sorry.

39:19.400 --> 39:20.358
Thanks.

39:21.663 --> 39:23.796
Hasn't been an easy night...

39:23.839 --> 39:25.232
but I've seen worse.

39:26.015 --> 39:28.366
Yeah, me too.

39:28.409 --> 39:31.107
Look, I hope you
consider staying with us.

39:31.151 --> 39:32.848
Could really use you
around here.

39:34.850 --> 39:36.243
Thanks, Hal.

39:47.689 --> 39:49.038
If you'll excuse me?

40:14.803 --> 40:15.978
Do you live here?

40:18.024 --> 40:19.329
I used to.

40:22.681 --> 40:24.465
I've been waiting for
someone like you.

40:58.368 --> 41:01.023
There are multiple stab wounds
to the abdomen.

41:01.067 --> 41:02.155
Knife?

41:03.504 --> 41:04.897
No.

41:04.940 --> 41:07.900
Puncture wounds, see...

41:07.943 --> 41:10.946
by two fine points.

41:10.990 --> 41:13.427
Are we talking vampires, Doc?

41:13.471 --> 41:14.907
Not a thirsty one.

41:16.561 --> 41:18.563
He was covered in blood.

41:18.606 --> 41:21.783
Um... is there any ink
in the wounds?

41:23.350 --> 41:24.482
Um...

41:27.049 --> 41:29.356
Let's wait for the labs.

41:29.399 --> 41:31.053
Looks like a painful way to go.

41:33.273 --> 41:34.579
Alright, thank you so much.

41:34.622 --> 41:35.623
Mm-hm.

46:27.262 --> 46:31.092
I think I found
some human remains.

46:33.747 --> 46:34.792
Hello?

46:35.923 --> 46:36.881
Hello?!

46:40.972 --> 46:43.539
His last words were,

46:43.583 --> 46:46.020
"Dude said no one could know."

46:46.064 --> 46:50.155
Do you think the dude he was
referring to was your husband?

46:51.504 --> 46:52.853
I don't think so.

46:52.897 --> 46:55.160
It was probably
just a coincidence.

46:55.203 --> 46:57.597
We don't believe
in coincidences.

46:57.640 --> 46:59.294
Tell us about
your husband, ma'am.

47:00.034 --> 47:01.035
Doctor.

47:05.300 --> 47:07.346
He's an architect.

47:07.389 --> 47:09.087
We've been married three years.

47:10.610 --> 47:12.699
Is your husband a violent man?

47:13.613 --> 47:14.788
No.

47:14.832 --> 47:16.877
You two getting along okay?

47:18.661 --> 47:20.054
Mm-hm.

47:23.579 --> 47:25.538
Will you check in on Tom?

47:25.581 --> 47:27.453
I'm kinda worried about him.

47:27.496 --> 47:28.584
You bet.

47:31.849 --> 47:35.591
If you have any concerns,
don't hesitate to call.

47:36.984 --> 47:38.159
Thank you.

47:57.657 --> 47:59.702
Don't make me take off my belt.

48:00.921 --> 48:02.009
Anthony!

48:47.402 --> 48:49.839
This asshole's never giving our
cleaning deposit back.

49:05.681 --> 49:08.206
- Peek-a-boo!

49:08.249 --> 49:10.860
Let's see who can
get a taller one.

49:16.040 --> 49:17.737
Hey, buckaroo!

49:19.826 --> 49:24.091
Look, you're finally
wearing the dress

49:24.135 --> 49:28.443
and it looks
quite lovely on you.

49:38.105 --> 49:39.628
I'll be staying for dinner.

49:39.672 --> 49:41.152
Did you get the chops
I sent over?

49:43.589 --> 49:48.550
You know, I bought that dress
for my Alice more than
20 years ago.

49:49.682 --> 49:50.988
Mm-hm.

49:54.295 --> 49:56.167
Hey, hey.

49:57.342 --> 49:59.387
Oh, I got your nose!

50:02.521 --> 50:04.088
Have you
been a good boy this week?

50:15.099 --> 50:18.493
What about you Marie?
Have you been a good girl?

50:21.714 --> 50:23.672
Considering the circumstances.

50:25.805 --> 50:31.593
Such as... this house,
which I bought and paid for,

50:31.637 --> 50:37.121
the groceries, the diapers
that are delivered to you
seven days a week.

50:37.164 --> 50:38.905
You might wanna be
a little careful.

50:38.948 --> 50:41.560
I'll get the impression
that you're not very grateful.

50:42.952 --> 50:47.305
Please try not to
overcook the chops.

50:47.348 --> 50:49.829
Otherwise, I'm gonna
have to dine at Joanne's.

50:52.136 --> 50:54.181
I hope you're
not jealous of her.

50:56.401 --> 50:59.360
You know, Joanne...

50:59.404 --> 51:05.192
she's not very good
at keeping a clean house.

51:05.236 --> 51:07.586
Or keeping secrets.

51:09.153 --> 51:11.677
If I were you,

51:11.720 --> 51:14.158
I wouldn't be sharing
anything with her

51:14.201 --> 51:17.857
that, well, unless you
want the whole neighborhood
to know about it.

51:19.032 --> 51:21.904
I didn't say anything to her.

51:21.948 --> 51:25.125
If you truly believe
what Joanne says you believe,

51:25.169 --> 51:29.303
well, you really should
notify the authorities.

51:32.176 --> 51:34.482
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

51:36.354 --> 51:37.485
- Oh!

51:39.270 --> 51:41.098
Why did you do that?

51:44.666 --> 51:45.667
Hm?

51:47.974 --> 51:50.063
Everything was perfect.

51:51.108 --> 51:53.545
Just like I imagined.

51:55.286 --> 51:57.505
My orange queen.

52:01.422 --> 52:05.122
Please. Please. Please.

52:10.779 --> 52:13.956
I'm afraid we're gonna
spoil this dress.

52:15.436 --> 52:19.788
I took Graham,
now I'm taking Eldridge.

52:57.086 --> 52:58.740
- Hm.

53:01.090 --> 53:03.571
Shh. Mommy's sleeping.

53:36.822 --> 53:38.258
Eldridge?

53:40.956 --> 53:42.480
You never left.

54:03.892 --> 54:05.981
Come on, come on...

54:06.025 --> 54:09.507
911, what's the nature
of your emergency?

54:09.550 --> 54:12.205
Hello, 911.

54:12.249 --> 54:16.601
Yes, uh, please
send a car to 1960 Marion Lane,

54:16.644 --> 54:18.516
Mandarin, California.

54:18.559 --> 54:21.083
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
Can you speak up?

54:23.912 --> 54:25.174
Can you hear me?

55:54.002 --> 56:00.052
Car 22,
we have reports of a 911 call
from 1960 Marion Lane.

56:00.095 --> 56:01.923
Copy that. On our way.

56:03.316 --> 56:05.579
Down the road from our 419.

56:07.015 --> 56:08.539
I hate coincidences.

56:26.600 --> 56:28.559
Oh, fuck.

56:37.437 --> 56:38.960
Evening, sir.
I'm Sergeant Choe.

56:39.004 --> 56:41.615
We received a 911 call
from this address.

56:41.659 --> 56:43.182
You know I...

56:43.225 --> 56:45.402
I think I accidentally
knocked the phone off the hook.

56:45.445 --> 56:47.229
I probably autodialed you.

56:47.273 --> 56:48.753
What's your name, sir?

56:50.189 --> 56:51.582
Eldridge Banner.

56:51.625 --> 56:53.497
Oh. Hey, Mr. Banner.

56:53.540 --> 56:55.760
We didn't realize
you lived here.

56:55.803 --> 56:58.110
Do you rent this home
on Home Rentz?

57:00.112 --> 57:03.158
You know, the Mandarin police
just keep getting prettier.

57:04.464 --> 57:06.031
Well, Mr. Banner, uh,

57:06.074 --> 57:07.859
there seems to have been
a big mix up.

57:07.902 --> 57:10.905
We were told there was
a Tom Levin at this address.

57:11.993 --> 57:13.604
No, I think you're mistaken.

57:13.647 --> 57:15.693
Did you order
any takeout tonight?

57:15.736 --> 57:17.172
No, I cook.

57:17.216 --> 57:21.568
Tonight was, uh,
grass-fed liver with broad beans

57:21.612 --> 57:23.527
paired with an '09 Amarone.

57:23.570 --> 57:25.442
It was truly exquisite.

57:29.750 --> 57:31.317
That sounds delicious.

57:31.360 --> 57:32.884
Got me hungry.

57:35.626 --> 57:39.499
Are you sure
there's no one else in here?

57:39.543 --> 57:42.328
No sweetie, not a soul.

57:42.371 --> 57:44.983
Would you mind if we come in
and take a look around.

57:45.026 --> 57:46.637
Uh, that won't be necessary.

57:46.680 --> 57:48.639
Uh, we're really sorry
to trouble you, Mr. Banner.

57:48.682 --> 57:50.075
We'll be on our way.

57:50.118 --> 57:51.685
No problem at all officers.

57:51.729 --> 57:54.993
I'll see you at the, uh,
next fundraiser.

57:55.036 --> 57:56.560
- Yeah.
- Alright.

57:58.257 --> 57:59.476
Have a safe night.

58:06.483 --> 58:08.528
Where the hell
did this hole come from?

58:08.572 --> 58:11.009
- Dude, what the hell was that?

58:11.052 --> 58:13.577
He wrote a ten million
dollar check to bail out
the department.

58:13.620 --> 58:15.404
Dude holds a lot of weight
around here.

58:15.448 --> 58:17.189
We have a witness
and a delivery slip

58:17.232 --> 58:18.843
that places our vic
at this house.

58:18.886 --> 58:20.801
What if Dodgeson
faked the receipts?

58:20.845 --> 58:23.674
- Or Banner's lying!
- Come on.

58:23.717 --> 58:26.241
Williams and Cryer can follow up
with the restaurant owner.

58:29.244 --> 58:30.681
Yo, hold on a sec.

58:31.638 --> 58:32.726
What?

58:37.862 --> 58:39.559
What is going on?

58:57.577 --> 59:00.841
Come on, if we hurry we can get
some fried chicken wrapped tacos

59:00.885 --> 59:02.669
before the drive-in closes.

59:02.713 --> 59:05.498
Fucking moron.

59:16.074 --> 59:17.554
Don't even think about it.

59:24.082 --> 59:25.910
I wanna see
the footage from earlier.

59:25.953 --> 59:28.739
You can run that by Chief Grady.

59:28.782 --> 59:31.045
Are we gonna serve and protect
or what?

59:31.089 --> 59:34.396
The only thing I want served
is a greasy fried taco.

59:34.440 --> 59:35.615
Come on. Let's go.

59:59.683 --> 1:00:04.296
Please, leave your message
for 3-0-3-6-1-0...

1:00:06.167 --> 1:00:08.387
Hey. I'm worried.

1:00:08.430 --> 1:00:10.128
Just let me know you're okay.

1:00:23.881 --> 1:00:25.447
Ah, shit.

1:01:09.622 --> 1:01:11.232
I saw him kill you.

1:01:13.582 --> 1:01:15.323
I-I felt like I...

1:01:17.021 --> 1:01:19.371
like I was you.

1:01:21.765 --> 1:01:24.855
He welcomed us to
the neighborhood with a smile.

1:01:26.987 --> 1:01:30.599
And then one by one
he took our husbands away.

1:01:31.731 --> 1:01:33.254
He's still here.

1:01:35.169 --> 1:01:36.605
Plotting his return.

1:01:36.649 --> 1:01:38.520
Return?!

1:01:38.564 --> 1:01:40.609
Come on, the dude's dead.

1:01:40.653 --> 1:01:42.220
That won't stop him.

1:01:42.263 --> 1:01:44.396
He's stuck in the house
he died in.

1:01:46.615 --> 1:01:48.008
Help me put an end to him.

1:01:49.401 --> 1:01:52.273
I think I'm just gonna
call an Uber

1:01:52.317 --> 1:01:56.103
and introduce your son's face
to this shovel.

1:02:10.422 --> 1:02:13.686
I designed you.
I built you.

1:02:14.774 --> 1:02:16.471
You have a purpose.

1:02:20.867 --> 1:02:22.347
I have a purpose.

1:02:41.714 --> 1:02:43.672
Keep drinking, fuck face.

1:06:18.626 --> 1:06:20.411
- Alice.
- Hey.

1:06:20.454 --> 1:06:22.587
I just submitted
your recommendation.

1:06:25.111 --> 1:06:26.156
Hm.

1:06:32.336 --> 1:06:34.033
Thank God.

1:06:34.077 --> 1:06:36.862
- I so need this.
- I know. I know.

1:06:56.099 --> 1:06:57.230
Tom?

1:07:09.634 --> 1:07:10.809
Tom.

1:07:19.078 --> 1:07:20.340
Tom?

1:07:30.959 --> 1:07:32.526
Hey, it's me.

1:07:34.050 --> 1:07:35.616
I had a tough night.

1:07:38.837 --> 1:07:43.233
I need you to try and understand
what it's like to be me.

1:07:44.582 --> 1:07:47.193
How tough this move
is for me, too.

1:07:49.108 --> 1:07:53.112
And if you leave
after I've asked you

1:07:53.156 --> 1:07:56.463
to show up and stick around

1:07:56.507 --> 1:08:00.076
it just tells me
you're not invested in us.

1:09:05.141 --> 1:09:06.533
She's not safe here.

1:09:09.057 --> 1:09:10.494
Can you warn her?

1:09:11.886 --> 1:09:14.150
She doesn't believe in
the hereafter.

1:09:19.416 --> 1:09:20.808
I don't remember.

1:09:20.852 --> 1:09:22.549
He drowned you.

1:09:30.514 --> 1:09:32.211
Show me how to stop him.

1:09:44.267 --> 1:09:45.529
Nice police work.

1:09:56.409 --> 1:10:00.413
Hey, Manny, um, I think
I found the murder weapon.

1:10:01.719 --> 1:10:04.983
It's an architectural
bow compass.

1:10:05.026 --> 1:10:06.463
What the hell's that?

1:10:06.506 --> 1:10:09.683
It's a--
it's a metallic instrument.

1:10:09.727 --> 1:10:12.164
Dual pointed. Architects use it.

1:10:12.208 --> 1:10:14.949
So Levin or Banner?

1:10:14.993 --> 1:10:16.821
Banner.

1:10:16.864 --> 1:10:18.344
You got a motive?

1:10:19.867 --> 1:10:21.869
I'm working on it.

1:10:21.913 --> 1:10:23.654
Raquel, both of our salaries

1:10:23.697 --> 1:10:25.699
are pretty much covered
by Eldridge Banner.

1:10:25.743 --> 1:10:28.528
Call Chief Grady
before you do anything stupid.

1:10:30.008 --> 1:10:31.183
Okay.

1:10:40.758 --> 1:10:42.238
Forget about your hand.

1:10:43.456 --> 1:10:44.979
It's not really there.

1:10:48.156 --> 1:10:51.116
Know you're moving the piece
before you even try.

1:10:53.249 --> 1:10:54.772
You have to focus.

1:10:54.815 --> 1:10:56.469
It's hard.

1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:00.604
Our minds are...

1:11:01.822 --> 1:11:04.085
what's left
of them are always hazy.

1:11:06.087 --> 1:11:08.046
Maybe I'm just a checkers guy.

1:11:13.007 --> 1:11:16.576
My husband and I
never finished this game.

1:11:16.620 --> 1:11:17.751
It must have been hard
watching Eldridge...

1:11:20.624 --> 1:11:21.799
turn into his father.

1:11:23.061 --> 1:11:24.454
Drove me mad.

1:11:27.021 --> 1:11:29.110
I didn't have
the strength to stop him.

1:11:29.154 --> 1:11:33.985
No, but you had the guts
to grab that knife and try.

1:11:35.856 --> 1:11:37.510
You tried to be a good mother.

1:11:45.518 --> 1:11:49.522
- What was your mother like?
- She had a great laugh.

1:11:49.566 --> 1:11:53.744
A mountain of curly black hair.

1:11:58.705 --> 1:12:01.404
When I was seven
we went for a car ride.

1:12:05.495 --> 1:12:07.148
No seatbelts.

1:12:10.804 --> 1:12:13.329
I stumbled out of the car
and, uh...

1:12:17.463 --> 1:12:19.900
she was laying there
in a sea of broken glass.

1:12:23.077 --> 1:12:25.341
I was scared a lot growing up.

1:12:26.777 --> 1:12:28.953
Feelings were something that...

1:12:32.173 --> 1:12:34.262
real men ignored.

1:12:36.352 --> 1:12:38.528
Feelings are all
that's left of us.

1:12:42.880 --> 1:12:43.968
Not exactly.

1:12:54.544 --> 1:12:56.459
Officer Raquel Dorado.

1:12:56.502 --> 1:12:57.808
Hi, Officer.

1:12:57.851 --> 1:12:59.679
This is Alice Dodgeson.

1:12:59.723 --> 1:13:02.073
Did you and your partner
speak with my husband
last night?

1:13:03.640 --> 1:13:06.425
Your husband wasn't at
the address you provided,

1:13:06.469 --> 1:13:08.645
uh, the owner was.

1:13:08.688 --> 1:13:12.431
- What?
- Eldridge Banner.

1:13:12.475 --> 1:13:15.303
He said he'd never
heard of a Tom Levin.

1:13:17.393 --> 1:13:19.046
Are you sure
you had the right house?

1:13:19.090 --> 1:13:21.527
One-nine-six-zero Marion Lane.

1:13:26.358 --> 1:13:28.969
Eldridge was in
this house last night?

1:13:31.015 --> 1:13:33.844
He was. I saw him myself.

1:13:36.107 --> 1:13:39.502
Officer, I have a bad feeling
my husband didn't just leave.

1:13:39.545 --> 1:13:41.286
Can you come here now please?

1:13:43.636 --> 1:13:45.551
Yes, of course. I'm on my way.

1:13:48.728 --> 1:13:50.643
This is how we can warn her.

1:13:58.608 --> 1:14:00.784
- If I may?
- Be my guest.

1:14:02.133 --> 1:14:04.222
The purpose of architecture...

1:14:04.265 --> 1:14:09.836
The purpose of architecture
is that after one has, um...

1:14:09.880 --> 1:14:14.406
moved on from this plane...
Hm?

1:14:14.450 --> 1:14:18.105
One has created something
that will live forever.

1:14:18.149 --> 1:14:20.194
This is true.

1:14:20.238 --> 1:14:23.589
You've gotten more professorial
in your age.

1:14:23.633 --> 1:14:25.373
- You, uh...

1:14:25.417 --> 1:14:29.639
You, uh, have a tendency
to be good at lecturing.

1:14:29.682 --> 1:14:32.076
I knew what you were saying.

1:14:32.119 --> 1:14:35.383
However, what if I were
to tell you

1:14:35.427 --> 1:14:37.124
you're looking at it
all backward.

1:14:39.126 --> 1:14:43.391
My blueprints,
I insisted that you used

1:14:43.435 --> 1:14:48.745
for a reason far greater,
uh, and consequential

1:14:48.788 --> 1:14:52.749
than maximizing
the square footage of a home.

1:14:52.792 --> 1:14:56.970
Years ago,
I came upon a grimoire,

1:14:58.363 --> 1:15:00.191
and it told about

1:15:00.234 --> 1:15:05.718
the ancient wraith
of the blood deed.

1:15:05.762 --> 1:15:09.417
During a rare blood wolf moon,

1:15:09.461 --> 1:15:15.380
it's possible
to impregnate a woman

1:15:15.423 --> 1:15:18.426
with an inhabitant...

1:15:19.558 --> 1:15:23.040
of the underground.

1:15:23.083 --> 1:15:29.133
The spirit is able
to escape death

1:15:29.176 --> 1:15:31.527
and gets reborn.

1:15:31.570 --> 1:15:36.314
Requisite is a proper
architectural space.

1:15:37.358 --> 1:15:39.273
A man and a woman.

1:15:40.361 --> 1:15:42.363
The vessel is the woman.

1:16:29.933 --> 1:16:31.238
Tom?

1:16:33.893 --> 1:16:35.416
- Hello.
- Oh.

1:16:35.460 --> 1:16:36.940
I must have gotten
the days mixed up.

1:16:36.983 --> 1:16:39.507
Uh, we have it booked
till tomorrow.

1:16:39.551 --> 1:16:41.640
Were you here last night?

1:16:41.684 --> 1:16:44.251
You must be Alice.
I'm Eldridge, the owner.

1:16:45.731 --> 1:16:46.950
Why are you here?

1:16:48.429 --> 1:16:50.127
My husband'll
be here any second.

1:16:51.432 --> 1:16:53.783
I doubt that.

1:16:53.826 --> 1:16:55.654
You know, I'm automatically
attracted to beautiful women.

1:17:07.448 --> 1:17:09.146
Alice!

1:17:25.510 --> 1:17:27.599
Please! Somebody help!

1:17:29.601 --> 1:17:30.776
Please!

1:17:33.344 --> 1:17:35.128
Please...

1:17:35.172 --> 1:17:36.826
- Oh, please!

1:18:31.271 --> 1:18:33.230
She took you over.
Don't blame me!

1:18:47.287 --> 1:18:50.116
You blacked out
by the pool and I-I just...

1:18:50.160 --> 1:18:51.596
I fell into you.

1:18:52.684 --> 1:18:54.642
I didn't even know that I could.

1:18:54.686 --> 1:18:56.253
Who are you?

1:18:58.081 --> 1:18:59.169
Elly.

1:19:06.872 --> 1:19:08.874
I'm your mother.

1:19:08.918 --> 1:19:10.441
Bullshit.

1:19:11.747 --> 1:19:13.487
Your father murdered me.

1:19:14.967 --> 1:19:17.143
She left him.

1:19:17.187 --> 1:19:18.928
That's how he knew
women couldn't be trusted.

1:19:18.971 --> 1:19:23.584
No, no. He trusted the nanny
and maids to raise you.

1:19:25.369 --> 1:19:28.241
My nanny was a mother to me.

1:19:28.285 --> 1:19:31.767
Your nanny was a prisoner.

1:19:31.810 --> 1:19:33.769
She knew he slit my throat
in front of you.

1:19:33.812 --> 1:19:35.205
You're not her.

1:19:37.729 --> 1:19:39.775
I possessed this body.

1:19:41.080 --> 1:19:42.952
And I didn't--
I didn't mean to.

1:19:44.823 --> 1:19:46.129
But I'm here,

1:19:46.172 --> 1:19:50.655
and I beg of you to please
put down that knife.

1:19:54.790 --> 1:19:58.794
Whoever you are,
if you die in another body

1:19:58.837 --> 1:20:01.927
you'll plummet into an abyss
of excruciating madness.

1:20:04.625 --> 1:20:06.323
I've already had
a lifetime of that.

1:20:10.718 --> 1:20:12.503
Elly, don't be like him.

1:20:15.941 --> 1:20:17.508
You're not like him.

1:20:24.863 --> 1:20:26.299
I'm just like him.

1:20:28.171 --> 1:20:29.433
He was a great man.

1:20:30.956 --> 1:20:32.523
He's going to be great again.

1:20:52.108 --> 1:20:54.240
I was trying to stop him.

1:20:55.894 --> 1:20:58.505
- I can't believe you!
- It was a mistake!

1:20:58.549 --> 1:20:59.550
I...

1:21:00.594 --> 1:21:02.683
What the hell was your plan?

1:21:02.727 --> 1:21:07.514
I put on your clothes, I...
I wanted to stop him.

1:21:07.558 --> 1:21:10.735
To try and save you two
from being here forever.

1:21:14.086 --> 1:21:16.784
I left your body
right before he...

1:21:18.699 --> 1:21:22.616
drowned you.
I'm so sorry.

1:21:30.581 --> 1:21:32.670
Help me finish what you started.

1:21:52.429 --> 1:21:55.171
I think as long as he's
unconscious you can possess him.

1:21:58.174 --> 1:22:00.480
I guess it's my turn to drive.

1:22:28.682 --> 1:22:29.814
Tom?

1:22:30.815 --> 1:22:32.034
I'm here, honey.

1:22:36.647 --> 1:22:38.649
Was so worried about you.

1:22:42.870 --> 1:22:44.524
He drugged me.

1:22:45.569 --> 1:22:47.832
I'm taking care of him.

1:22:47.875 --> 1:22:49.399
Just rest, okay?

1:22:53.664 --> 1:22:55.274
Where's your ring?

1:22:57.320 --> 1:22:58.495
Don't worry.

1:24:00.731 --> 1:24:03.908
Doctor...
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:13.700
Eldridge... drugged me.

1:24:15.876 --> 1:24:17.704
- Find Tom.
- Okay.

1:24:17.748 --> 1:24:19.793
- Please find him.
- Okay. Just stay here.

1:24:19.837 --> 1:24:21.317
Don't go anywhere, okay?

1:24:52.652 --> 1:24:57.788
Drop the shovel
and put your hands on your head.

1:24:57.831 --> 1:25:00.007
Put your hands on your head.

1:25:00.051 --> 1:25:01.357
Let me handle this.

1:25:05.143 --> 1:25:06.666
So who's pretty now?

1:25:08.103 --> 1:25:09.234
Have we met?

1:25:10.496 --> 1:25:12.455
I'm the cop you said was pretty.

1:25:12.498 --> 1:25:15.197
Look... I'm not
who you think I am.

1:25:15.240 --> 1:25:17.155
I think you're a piece of shit

1:25:17.199 --> 1:25:19.462
burying some dude
in your back yard.
Get on your knees.

1:25:22.073 --> 1:25:23.683
Well, you're not entirely off.

1:25:23.727 --> 1:25:26.251
Technically, I'm unburying him.

1:25:27.339 --> 1:25:28.906
Is that Tom Levin?

1:25:29.907 --> 1:25:31.648
Sort of.

1:25:31.691 --> 1:25:32.823
Look, I'm-I'm doing this

1:25:32.866 --> 1:25:34.303
to show you what he's...

1:25:34.346 --> 1:25:36.261
what I've done.

1:25:43.442 --> 1:25:45.183
You expecting someone?

1:25:49.013 --> 1:25:53.800
Chief, I found him burying
a corpse in the backyard.

1:25:59.371 --> 1:26:00.590
This true?

1:26:01.939 --> 1:26:03.114
Arrest me.

1:26:03.158 --> 1:26:05.812
Just take care of Alice.

1:26:05.856 --> 1:26:08.380
You don't wanna hurt her?
You care about her?

1:26:08.424 --> 1:26:11.209
- Where's Dr. Dodgeson?
She's in the bedroom.

1:26:11.253 --> 1:26:12.732
She was tranquilized.

1:26:12.776 --> 1:26:15.431
But she's-she's stable
and she's semi-conscious.

1:26:17.215 --> 1:26:19.174
You've got some
explaining to do.

1:26:25.354 --> 1:26:27.312
It's Tom Levin.

1:26:27.356 --> 1:26:29.706
Banner was throwing dirt
on him when I arrived.

1:26:29.749 --> 1:26:31.751
My father
committed multiple murders.

1:26:33.318 --> 1:26:34.972
This whole property's
a graveyard.

1:26:36.147 --> 1:26:37.496
Get on your knees.

1:26:38.932 --> 1:26:41.152
- Sir, what are you--
- On your knees, I said.

1:26:41.196 --> 1:26:43.285
- What are you doing? This--
- It's okay, Dorado.

1:26:44.982 --> 1:26:48.725
I wanna know
what in the hell is going on.

1:26:52.598 --> 1:26:54.252
- Chief, what--

1:26:56.733 --> 1:27:01.085
Now tell me why you don't
recognize your goddamn brother.

1:27:02.521 --> 1:27:06.090
So much trouble
to cover our tracks.

1:27:06.133 --> 1:27:08.440
Took care of anyone
who knew you were here.

1:27:08.484 --> 1:27:12.270
Yet somehow you got
the upper hand, Mr. Levin.

1:27:14.011 --> 1:27:15.752
You learn quickly, Mr. Levin.

1:27:15.795 --> 1:27:18.450
Utilizing the space
inside our creations

1:27:18.494 --> 1:27:20.844
is the hallmark
of a great architect.

1:27:27.154 --> 1:27:29.896
Leave my wife alone.

1:27:29.940 --> 1:27:32.943
You are no longer of the world.

1:27:32.986 --> 1:27:35.032
She is mine to claim.

1:27:35.075 --> 1:27:39.863
Despite my instructions
to find a fiery haired vixen,

1:27:39.906 --> 1:27:43.127
Eldridge chose your Alice
as my vessel.

1:27:43.170 --> 1:27:49.481
Women were put here
to tempt us, to vex us.

1:27:49.525 --> 1:27:55.574
The true work of man
is to shut Pandora
back in her box.

1:27:55.618 --> 1:28:00.100
Some things like you, Mr. Levin,
were not built to last.

1:28:02.059 --> 1:28:04.583
Oh... my God...

1:28:06.237 --> 1:28:09.893
How many years has it been?
Hm?

1:28:11.677 --> 1:28:13.984
You been
watching the whole time.

1:28:15.246 --> 1:28:18.641
Scheming, muck up my plans.

1:28:19.946 --> 1:28:22.209
You don't have power
over me anymore.

1:28:23.689 --> 1:28:25.169
You already took everything.

1:28:25.212 --> 1:28:28.085
No, it was you
that took from me.

1:28:28.128 --> 1:28:30.479
You ungrateful trollop.

1:28:33.395 --> 1:28:36.789
You never loved me.

1:28:36.833 --> 1:28:38.138
See you in hell.

1:28:38.182 --> 1:28:42.404
You'll have to wait
another lifetime, dear.

1:28:42.447 --> 1:28:44.231
I plan to stay a while.

1:28:52.718 --> 1:28:53.980
Tom?

1:28:58.376 --> 1:29:01.466
Tom?! Where are you?

1:29:06.558 --> 1:29:07.733
Tom?!

1:29:11.607 --> 1:29:12.825
Marie?!

1:29:19.354 --> 1:29:20.877
Marie?!

1:29:24.010 --> 1:29:25.577
What is this place?

1:29:28.450 --> 1:29:29.581
Where are you?

1:29:34.804 --> 1:29:39.025
He trapped us here.
Can you find me?

1:29:43.029 --> 1:29:44.335
Follow my voice.

1:29:46.119 --> 1:29:50.080
Tom... reach for me.

1:30:35.952 --> 1:30:40.478
We have reached the equinox
of the blood wolf moon.

1:30:40.522 --> 1:30:44.351
The time to conjure our father
back into this world.

1:30:51.663 --> 1:30:53.752
Tom, reach for me.

1:30:55.493 --> 1:30:56.929
Don't look back.

1:31:12.989 --> 1:31:14.469
How did we escape?

1:31:15.687 --> 1:31:17.167
Same as Frederick.

1:31:18.734 --> 1:31:20.823
My eavesdropping
finally paid off.

1:31:22.172 --> 1:31:24.522
She'll be unconscious.

1:31:24.566 --> 1:31:26.959
Possess her and you can
catch them off-guard.

1:31:28.874 --> 1:31:30.223
She didn't train ten years

1:31:30.267 --> 1:31:32.051
just to change his diapers.

1:31:48.764 --> 1:31:51.984
Let our brother Eldridge
receive the wandering ghost.

1:31:52.028 --> 1:31:53.551
Wraith of the blood deed.

1:31:53.595 --> 1:32:00.558
Our father who has been
with us from seed... to soul.

1:32:00.602 --> 1:32:03.866
Let us imbibe the blood
of our vessel's lover.

1:32:23.015 --> 1:32:26.497
No, s-stop...

1:32:26.541 --> 1:32:28.368
I wouldn't wanna sleep
through this either.

1:32:29.674 --> 1:32:32.285
She's about to
become part of history.

1:32:36.115 --> 1:32:38.944
Consecrate her
to our orange king.

1:33:06.058 --> 1:33:07.364
My boys.

1:33:10.236 --> 1:33:13.022
Let us summon
my perfection back...

1:33:14.719 --> 1:33:16.678
into the world of matter.

1:33:18.201 --> 1:33:20.899
Behind these walls

1:33:20.943 --> 1:33:25.861
surrounded by looking glass
we do as we wish.

1:33:39.004 --> 1:33:40.266
She's awake!

1:33:47.056 --> 1:33:48.623
Don't!

1:33:52.365 --> 1:33:54.150
She needs to be unconscious.

1:34:01.157 --> 1:34:04.726
Blood and honor.
We do as we wish.

1:34:24.310 --> 1:34:26.573
Father! Father!

1:34:26.617 --> 1:34:28.314
Stop her!

1:34:43.982 --> 1:34:45.201
She came to!

1:34:45.244 --> 1:34:47.856
You've ruined everything!

1:34:50.336 --> 1:34:53.426
Get off me! No!

1:35:05.525 --> 1:35:07.527
Why don't you try on
hot head over there?

1:36:08.153 --> 1:36:09.676
Why are you struggling?

1:36:11.722 --> 1:36:13.071
Through the ages

1:36:13.115 --> 1:36:15.378
you've been good
for only one thing.

1:36:15.421 --> 1:36:17.032
The thing I need.

1:36:17.075 --> 1:36:19.295
To give me more time.

1:36:27.390 --> 1:36:29.784
Your time's up, motherfucker!

1:36:46.452 --> 1:36:48.803
911, what's the nature
of your emergency?

1:36:58.116 --> 1:36:59.683
- Tom?
- Yeah?

1:36:59.726 --> 1:37:01.467
What happened to you?

1:37:03.730 --> 1:37:05.167
Don't worry about me.

1:37:07.430 --> 1:37:08.779
Help is on the way.

1:37:08.823 --> 1:37:10.694
Hold my hand.

1:37:10.737 --> 1:37:12.087
Okay.

1:37:12.130 --> 1:37:13.175
Pressure's falling.

1:37:14.263 --> 1:37:16.134
No, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey...

1:37:16.178 --> 1:37:17.396
You're not dying tonight.

1:37:18.702 --> 1:37:20.269
Hey... Okay.

1:37:43.814 --> 1:37:46.425
I'm sorry I wasn't here for you
when I should have been.

1:37:49.820 --> 1:37:51.561
I could have
listened to you more.

1:37:54.607 --> 1:37:56.522
I could have put myself
in your shoes.

1:38:01.353 --> 1:38:03.007
You would have
hated those shoes.

1:38:13.191 --> 1:38:15.367
I'm glad you're holding my hand.

1:38:16.629 --> 1:38:17.979
You're holding mine.

1:38:23.593 --> 1:38:25.812
I don't wanna live in
a Banner house.

1:38:25.856 --> 1:38:28.859
No, no. Absolutely not.

1:38:32.428 --> 1:38:37.302
Maybe a... Paul Williams
if it's on the market.

1:38:37.346 --> 1:38:43.004
If you're looking for modernism.
But not a troubled architect.

1:38:43.047 --> 1:38:44.527
Shut up.

1:38:44.570 --> 1:38:45.963
Hey.

1:38:46.007 --> 1:38:47.878
- Mm.
- Mm.

1:38:50.576 --> 1:38:51.621
It's gonna be okay.

1:38:53.666 --> 1:38:54.972
Yeah.

1:38:57.583 --> 1:38:58.628
I love you.

1:39:02.501 --> 1:39:03.894
I love you, too.

1:39:30.225 --> 1:39:31.791
What a shit show.

1:39:34.098 --> 1:39:35.447
What are my vitals?

1:39:38.363 --> 1:39:40.322
Hey, you're gonna be okay.

1:39:41.584 --> 1:39:43.455
Take me to the hospital please.

1:40:17.359 --> 1:40:20.057
The truth was staring
at me through the glass.

1:40:20.101 --> 1:40:21.711
But I didn't see it.

1:40:32.765 --> 1:40:35.942
Love is showing up
and sticking around.
