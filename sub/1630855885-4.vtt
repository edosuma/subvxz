WEBVTT

00:11.185 --> 00:14.014
Hey, guys.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.842
- Oh, finally.
Where have you been?
- You had us worried.

00:16.842 --> 00:18.583
It's been years
since my last trivia contest.

00:18.583 --> 00:20.716
I needed to bone up
on some deficient areas.

00:20.716 --> 00:22.457
Sports, for example.

00:23.719 --> 00:25.460
Did you know

00:25.460 --> 00:27.984
that the Knickerbockers
of New York City

00:27.984 --> 00:29.855
have a spirited rivalry

00:29.855 --> 00:31.770
with the Boston "Keltics?"

00:32.902 --> 00:34.599
Maybe I should take sports.

00:34.599 --> 00:36.645
Fine, I know
when I'm out of my element.

00:36.645 --> 00:38.255
You know where
I'm in my element?

00:38.255 --> 00:39.691
The table of elements.

00:39.691 --> 00:42.085
You'll get
the correct answer faster

00:42.085 --> 00:43.826
than the half-life
of livermorium.

00:45.784 --> 00:48.091
Brilliant.

00:48.091 --> 00:50.615
None of us dated
in high school, did we?

00:50.615 --> 00:52.139
Oh, Eve,

00:52.139 --> 00:53.792
may I have a Negroni, please?

00:53.792 --> 00:55.620
Yeah, and I'll have a Cognac,
the, uh, Louis Treize.

00:55.620 --> 00:57.840
You know that's
150 a glass, right?

00:57.840 --> 01:01.061
152 with a tip,
if you cut the small talk.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.627
If memory serves,

01:02.627 --> 01:05.282
the winning trivia team
drinks for free.

01:05.282 --> 01:07.284
Mm, you seem pretty confident.

01:07.284 --> 01:10.200
That's a fun new color
from condescending.

01:11.027 --> 01:12.507
One-fifty-one.

01:14.291 --> 01:16.467
You know,
back in our Oxford days,

01:16.467 --> 01:18.643
this one here
was an unstoppable force

01:18.643 --> 01:20.428
- at our local pub quiz.
- Oh.

01:20.428 --> 01:22.473
Frasier, were you ever bested?

01:22.473 --> 01:24.693
I believe the answer
to that trivia question

01:24.693 --> 01:26.086
is "hell no!"

01:26.086 --> 01:27.652
Good.

01:27.652 --> 01:29.306
I want to dominate.

01:29.306 --> 01:31.178
My, you're competitive.

01:31.178 --> 01:33.528
You should have seen her
at the faculty retreat.

01:33.528 --> 01:36.139
You do not make
youngest department head

01:36.139 --> 01:38.837
by catching your rival
during a trust fall.

01:40.012 --> 01:41.579
Oh.

01:41.579 --> 01:44.016
Freddy, hi. Did you come
to witness your old man

01:44.016 --> 01:46.497
- in his moment of triumph, huh?
Hi, boys.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

01:46.497 --> 01:48.064
I even brought the guys
so we can lift you up

01:48.064 --> 01:49.500
on our shoulders after you win.

01:49.500 --> 01:50.675
Well, just be careful
about my trick knee...

01:50.675 --> 01:52.155
Oh, you're joking.

01:54.201 --> 01:56.768
Yeah, we have our own team,
and we're pretty damn good.

01:58.161 --> 02:00.337
Welcome, nerds.

02:00.337 --> 02:02.687
I am Eve, your emcee.

02:02.687 --> 02:04.602
After last week's trivia night,

02:04.602 --> 02:06.778
I just want to start
with a blanket,

02:06.778 --> 02:08.519
"Aw, you're so sweet,

02:08.519 --> 02:10.478
but I'm busy this weekend."

02:10.478 --> 02:13.350
Introducing tonight's teams.

02:13.350 --> 02:15.178
From the theology department,

02:15.178 --> 02:16.397
Cata-quiz-em.

02:16.397 --> 02:18.181
Forgive them, Lord,

02:18.181 --> 02:21.141
for they know not anything.

02:22.316 --> 02:25.710
The French department team,
Les Quiz-erables.

02:27.756 --> 02:30.193
Might as well surrender
the way you always do.

02:31.238 --> 02:33.283
The fire department team,

02:33.283 --> 02:36.156
First Responders
are the True Heroes.

02:37.069 --> 02:39.246
- More like...
- I wouldn't.

02:40.116 --> 02:42.379
And the psychology department,

02:42.379 --> 02:44.251
The "jung" and the Restless?

02:44.251 --> 02:46.383
"Young," as in Carl Jung.

02:46.383 --> 02:48.342
I told you we should have
had T-shirts.

02:48.342 --> 02:50.431
Okay, you know the rules.

02:50.431 --> 02:52.215
Ding the bell
when you know the answer.

02:52.215 --> 02:53.651
Here we go.

02:53.651 --> 02:55.305
I know my classic comedies.

02:55.305 --> 02:56.393
You're describing MoliÃ¨re's

02:56.393 --> 02:58.265
<i>Les Fourberies de Scapin.</i>

02:58.265 --> 03:00.267
Close.
<i>Weekend at Bernie's.</i>

03:01.746 --> 03:04.923
Uh, Taizu defeated
the Mongolian rulers,

03:04.923 --> 03:07.143
which led to the Ming dynasty.

03:07.143 --> 03:09.232
- Correct.
- Ming.

03:09.232 --> 03:11.365
I was gonna say Tang.

03:11.365 --> 03:13.541
Onomatopoeia.

03:13.541 --> 03:15.717
As in "boom!"

03:17.197 --> 03:19.068
<i>Murder, She Wrote.</i>

03:19.068 --> 03:20.852
- I need her name.
- Oh, oh, oh, um,

03:20.852 --> 03:23.028
she was Mrs. Potts,
uh, <i>The Manchurian Candidate,</i>

03:23.028 --> 03:27.250
<i>- Bedknobs and Broomsticks, she...</i>
- Dame Angela Lansbury.

03:29.818 --> 03:31.863
My ex-wife Lilith.

03:31.863 --> 03:33.952
I'm kidding.

03:33.952 --> 03:35.693
The arctic circle.

03:37.129 --> 03:39.828
Oh. Sorry, Frederick.

03:39.828 --> 03:42.831
The astronaut
drink of choice was Tang.

03:44.049 --> 03:47.139
Tang.
I was gonna say Ming.

03:47.139 --> 03:48.967
Manhattan.

03:49.707 --> 03:51.143
Oh, no, I wasn't answering,
I was ordering.

03:51.143 --> 03:53.102
Can I have a Manhattan?

03:53.102 --> 03:55.887
The 1986 Boston Celtics.

03:56.671 --> 04:00.196
Why does everyone insist
on mispronouncing "Keltics"?

04:01.632 --> 04:04.809
I am surrounded
by "Neandertals."

04:07.029 --> 04:10.075
Who coined the phrase
"All's well that ends well"?

04:10.075 --> 04:11.294
Shakespeare.

04:11.294 --> 04:12.469
Correct.
- Uh, uh, uh, no,

04:12.469 --> 04:15.298
no, no, it's
credited to Shakespeare,

04:15.298 --> 04:17.300
but Thomas Middleton,
who introduced him

04:17.300 --> 04:19.824
to the Boccaccio tale
in which the play was based,

04:19.824 --> 04:22.087
was a far more likely candidate

04:22.087 --> 04:24.481
to coin the phr-the phrase.

04:31.358 --> 04:33.577
Yeah, Wikipedia
says Shakespeare.

04:34.796 --> 04:37.538
Point to the firefighters.
Score is tied.

04:37.538 --> 04:40.149
And for the final
category: wine.

04:40.149 --> 04:41.846
- Ooh!
- Oh! Stand back.

04:41.846 --> 04:43.326
- I've got this.
- Okay.

04:43.326 --> 04:45.197
Unless the subject
is Oregon Rieslings,

04:45.197 --> 04:47.287
which I refuse to acknowledge.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.463
What do you call a wine bottle

04:49.463 --> 04:51.073
that holds 15 liters?

04:51.073 --> 04:53.162
A good time!

04:54.119 --> 04:56.121
No, I-I've got this.
It's a funny story, actu...

04:57.297 --> 04:59.081
- Nebuchadnezzar.
- That's right!

04:59.081 --> 05:00.735
Congrats, firefighters,
you win!

05:05.392 --> 05:07.524
- How did you know that?
- Ah, well, you know

05:07.524 --> 05:09.831
how some kids get to spend
their summers playing baseball?

05:09.831 --> 05:12.442
I got to catalogue
my dad's wine cellar.

05:12.442 --> 05:14.444
That's cool.
I spent my summers

05:14.444 --> 05:17.186
on Cape Cod
covering for my dad's affairs.

05:20.102 --> 05:21.712
Damn it, I hate losing.

05:21.712 --> 05:23.148
No, we didn't lose.

05:23.148 --> 05:24.759
We were robbed of a victory.

05:24.759 --> 05:26.369
And I won't stand for it.

05:26.369 --> 05:28.110
Um, Eve?

05:28.110 --> 05:30.242
A moment of your time?

05:30.242 --> 05:32.244
Aw, you're so sweet,

05:32.244 --> 05:35.335
but I'm busy this weekend.

05:36.161 --> 05:37.424
In your dreams.

05:37.424 --> 05:40.383
You will rue the day
you fought me

05:40.383 --> 05:42.037
over Shakespeare and Middleton.

05:42.037 --> 05:44.474
You know, you have made the
greatest mistake of your life.

05:44.474 --> 05:47.259
The greatest mistake of my life
was not saying "I love you"

05:47.259 --> 05:49.000
to my boyfriend
the morning he left

05:49.000 --> 05:50.959
and never came back.

05:51.829 --> 05:54.223
You've made the second greatest
mistake of your life.

05:54.223 --> 05:55.746
And until this issue

05:55.746 --> 05:58.270
is resolved,
I'm not paying my tab.

05:58.270 --> 06:00.751
Then I guess
you're done drinking.

06:03.450 --> 06:05.365
Fellow heroes, we did it!

06:05.365 --> 06:08.368
How about a round to celebrate?

06:10.935 --> 06:12.459
Ah.

06:12.459 --> 06:15.200
- All right.
- Well, congratulations.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.159
It must be fun to show up

06:17.159 --> 06:18.856
and beat the academics
at their own game.

06:18.856 --> 06:22.338
You know, maybe I should show up
at your job and put out a fire.

06:25.167 --> 06:26.516
Ooh!

06:26.516 --> 06:28.779
That was so hard.

06:31.652 --> 06:33.523
You know,
I'm not surprised you won.

06:33.523 --> 06:35.656
My son has always been a highly
educated, well-read young man.

06:35.656 --> 06:38.789
Nobody would think
that he was just a fireman.

06:38.789 --> 06:40.617
"Just" a fireman?

06:40.617 --> 06:42.184
Oh, I'm sorry.
That came out wrong.

06:42.184 --> 06:43.446
Nobody would guess
you're only a fireman.

06:43.446 --> 06:46.493
Oh.
That's not better, is it?

06:46.493 --> 06:48.843
Nope, it's also not surprising.

06:48.843 --> 06:50.366
My dad's always felt that being

06:50.366 --> 06:51.976
a firefighter
was somehow beneath me.

06:51.976 --> 06:53.935
Oh, not in the least.
I don't think that at all.

06:53.935 --> 06:55.284
No, it's okay. It's fine, Dad.

06:55.284 --> 06:56.677
I'm just gonna head
back to my buddies

06:56.677 --> 06:58.113
and maybe catch the end
of the Celtics game.

06:58.113 --> 07:00.071
Yeah.

07:00.071 --> 07:02.334
That's right: Celtics.

07:03.597 --> 07:04.641
Celtics.

07:05.686 --> 07:07.078
Celtics.

07:10.865 --> 07:12.780
Oh, people, people.

07:12.780 --> 07:15.086
Don't block the fire lanes.

07:16.740 --> 07:18.438
Civilians.

07:24.313 --> 07:26.924
- Good morning.
What are you up to?
- Hey.

07:26.924 --> 07:28.665
Well, I'm making my chili for
the guys at the station tonight,

07:28.665 --> 07:31.451
but, uh, got to
double the recipe.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.148
Which is, you know,
tough 'cause I'm...

07:33.148 --> 07:35.846
just a firefighter, so...

07:35.846 --> 07:39.546
Uh, Dad, help me out,
what is two times four again?

07:39.546 --> 07:41.156
I just...

07:41.156 --> 07:42.853
You were a mathlete.

07:42.853 --> 07:44.507
You know it's eight.

07:44.507 --> 07:45.726
Right.

07:45.726 --> 07:47.684
Eight, the one
that looks like a snowman.

07:48.772 --> 07:50.034
Here's your chili pot.

07:50.034 --> 07:51.558
Oh, thanks, Eve.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.211
It's, uh... uh...

07:53.211 --> 07:56.040
Eve, why does this smell
like baby lotion?

07:56.040 --> 07:59.391
Ah. Old family recipe.

08:00.610 --> 08:02.525
Also, I took some
really cute photos of John

08:02.525 --> 08:04.701
- dressed up as a lobster.
- You got to stop...

08:05.572 --> 08:08.575
- Oh, my God,
that is insanely cute.
- Yeah.

08:08.575 --> 08:10.664
Five-alarm chili. You know,
since you already have most

08:10.664 --> 08:13.014
of the ingredients, why don't
you consider making chili's

08:13.014 --> 08:15.103
more sophisticated
French cousin?

08:15.103 --> 08:17.105
The cassoulet.

08:17.105 --> 08:19.542
It's where the bean
truly shines.

08:19.542 --> 08:21.631
I don't know, Dad,
sounds kind of tricky.

08:21.631 --> 08:23.894
Think I can handle that
since I'm just a firefighter?

08:23.894 --> 08:27.245
Oh, God. You know I have
great respect for firefighters.

08:27.245 --> 08:29.378
- But?
- However.

08:30.597 --> 08:33.034
I have always wondered
why you narrowed your choices

08:33.034 --> 08:34.601
down to just this one.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.559
Given that you have
so many gifts.

08:36.559 --> 08:39.823
I use all my gifts--
mental, physical, sartorial.

08:39.823 --> 08:41.433
That's right.

08:41.433 --> 08:43.740
I designed this shirt.
See the stitching?

08:43.740 --> 08:46.090
- No.
- Exactly.

08:49.790 --> 08:52.314
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. It's just...

08:52.314 --> 08:55.404
My dad is always
so dismissive of my job.

08:55.404 --> 08:57.885
I mean, I-I honestly don't think
he'll ever understand

08:57.885 --> 08:59.364
why I do what I do.

08:59.364 --> 09:00.844
Maybe he would
if he saw you in action.

09:00.844 --> 09:02.977
Oh, sure, I'll just
start a small grease fire,

09:02.977 --> 09:04.282
- see where it goes.
- No.

09:04.282 --> 09:06.458
Invite him down to the station.

09:06.458 --> 09:08.896
I didn't appreciate
what Adam did until I came down

09:08.896 --> 09:10.680
and saw what you guys do
every day.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.377
Uh, I guess I could try.

09:12.377 --> 09:15.816
Hey, uh, can I borrow
a salad bowl?

09:16.773 --> 09:18.906
Oh, come on, I'll put
a cabbage leaf on his head.

09:18.906 --> 09:21.169
He'll be so cute.

09:24.346 --> 09:26.130
Hey, Dad, crazy idea.

09:26.130 --> 09:27.958
You want to come down
to the station today

09:27.958 --> 09:29.481
and make that casserole thing?

09:29.481 --> 09:31.571
Cassoulet.

09:32.397 --> 09:35.183
A casserole is made with
canned soup and potato chips.

09:36.619 --> 09:38.795
I appreciate the offer,
but I'm rather busy today.

09:38.795 --> 09:40.405
Oh, okay, just...

09:40.405 --> 09:42.364
weird. 'cause I remember
you saying you were moving

09:42.364 --> 09:44.758
to Boston so we could reconnect.

09:44.758 --> 09:46.803
But I-I guess your plan
was to get closer

09:46.803 --> 09:49.110
without actually
spending any time together.

09:50.067 --> 09:52.635
You know, I hate it
when people quote me to me.

09:54.028 --> 09:56.160
Makes it so much harder
to object.

09:56.160 --> 09:58.162
So you'll come? Great.

09:58.162 --> 10:00.164
I'll get dressed.
Oh, wait, remind me--

10:00.164 --> 10:01.905
do I put the pants
on one leg at a time

10:01.905 --> 10:04.560
- or wear them on my head like...
- Just cut that out!

10:09.696 --> 10:11.523
Well, here it is.

10:13.830 --> 10:17.181
Boy, you can just feel
the testosterone in this place.

10:17.181 --> 10:20.315
I'm fighting a deep-seated urge
to hand that man my lunch money.

10:21.446 --> 10:23.797
I'm glad you're here.
But just so you know,

10:23.797 --> 10:26.016
things can get real
in a big hurry.

10:26.016 --> 10:27.365
You never know
when some emergency's

10:27.365 --> 10:28.671
gonna upend your entire day.

10:28.671 --> 10:30.325
- Freddy! Thank God you're here!
- Aah!

10:30.325 --> 10:31.674
We need you, stat.

10:31.674 --> 10:34.546
Here we go.
Who knows what this could be.

10:36.070 --> 10:37.506
Do we have to do this today?

10:37.506 --> 10:40.422
We can't do
a sexy firefighter calendar

10:40.422 --> 10:42.380
without our Mr. July.

10:42.380 --> 10:44.426
By the way, would you rather

10:44.426 --> 10:47.690
wear a red, white and blue
Speedo or just

10:47.690 --> 10:50.737
cover your junk
with a Lincoln hat?

10:50.737 --> 10:54.175
It's a fitting tribute
to the Great Emancipator.

10:54.958 --> 10:56.568
Hey, Dad, just so you know,
this calendar

10:56.568 --> 10:58.309
raises money
for underprivileged kids.

10:58.309 --> 10:59.876
Okay? Yeah, they visit

10:59.876 --> 11:01.661
all the time. We made a real
difference in their lives.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.663
- Very good, Frederick.
- Yeah, yeah, it is.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.882
A-And y... Okay.
Just wait until you see

11:05.882 --> 11:08.232
all the other aspects of my job.
It's getting weird.

11:08.232 --> 11:10.757
See, we're experts
in emergency medical care,

11:10.757 --> 11:13.760
uh, disaster response,
hazardous material mitigation.

11:13.760 --> 11:16.545
Could we at least pop
that shirt off? Pecs sell.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.243
No, we're good.

11:19.243 --> 11:21.724
Come on, Freddy.
I was the New Year's baby.

11:21.724 --> 11:23.334
Nothing but a diaper.

11:23.334 --> 11:25.119
Yeah, Freddy.

11:25.119 --> 11:27.034
Take your clothes off.

11:27.034 --> 11:28.644
For the kids.

11:31.168 --> 11:32.735
David.

11:32.735 --> 11:34.955
Oh, hi, Uncle.

11:34.955 --> 11:37.218
- I got the groceries you needed.
- What did you do--

11:37.218 --> 11:39.002
wrestle the grocer for them?

11:39.002 --> 11:40.612
- You look terrible.
- I know.

11:40.612 --> 11:42.963
No, I spent all weekend
in the library. I haven't

11:42.963 --> 11:46.575
- showered or eaten since Friday.
- Did you have a paper due?

11:46.575 --> 11:49.186
No, I went through a fire door
and got locked in the basement.

11:50.013 --> 11:51.928
Again.

11:51.928 --> 11:54.322
C-Come and sit down, rest a bit.

11:55.323 --> 11:56.759
Hi, Freddy.

11:56.759 --> 11:58.108
Hey, David.

11:58.108 --> 11:59.588
You know Freddy?

11:59.588 --> 12:01.677
Well, yeah, he's like
a big brother to me.

12:01.677 --> 12:04.419
Especially 'cause
my parents aren't around.

12:05.289 --> 12:07.248
Man, I miss them.

12:07.248 --> 12:10.686
Did you know one of the orphans
was coming today?

12:11.600 --> 12:14.037
Do you mind?
I'm starving.

12:14.037 --> 12:15.473
Oh, go ahead, big man.

12:17.998 --> 12:20.522
Man, every one they send

12:20.522 --> 12:23.090
is worse off than the last one.

12:28.182 --> 12:30.314
You know what?

12:30.314 --> 12:32.316
Let's give him
the best day of his life.

12:32.316 --> 12:34.536
Hey, buddy? You want

12:34.536 --> 12:37.147
- to see where
the firefighters sleep?
- Do I!

12:37.974 --> 12:40.498
Last night I slept
on the floor of the library.

12:40.498 --> 12:43.501
Used a newspaper as a blanket.

12:44.285 --> 12:46.461
Bless your heart.

13:07.090 --> 13:09.353
You are wasting your time.

13:11.312 --> 13:12.922
I'm not a dog person.

13:12.922 --> 13:14.576
Shoo.

13:15.925 --> 13:17.535
Think you're gonna wear me down?

13:17.535 --> 13:20.625
Trust me, I have had
years of experience.

13:20.625 --> 13:23.498
I outlasted that little mongrel,
I'll outlast you.

13:25.587 --> 13:27.763
- Anything going on?
- Nope.

13:27.763 --> 13:30.287
District is free and clear
of emergencies.

13:30.287 --> 13:33.073
Damn it. I want Dad
to see us in action.

13:33.073 --> 13:36.076
There's got
to be a fire somewhere.

13:38.208 --> 13:40.036
No, like, a good fire, you know,

13:40.036 --> 13:42.822
like a meth lab
full of Yankees fans.

13:43.605 --> 13:46.042
Hey, Doc, you need a sous chef?

13:46.042 --> 13:47.652
Well, yeah, sure, Moose.

13:47.652 --> 13:49.045
I didn't know you had
any experience in the kitchen.

13:49.045 --> 13:50.568
I know a thing or two.

13:50.568 --> 13:52.309
I mostly do desserts-- flan,

13:52.309 --> 13:54.703
crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e, pain au chocolat.

13:55.922 --> 13:57.880
But my specialty is mousse.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.577
That's how I got my nickname.

13:59.577 --> 14:02.754
Of course,
your nickname is Moose.

14:02.754 --> 14:05.018
You're named after a dessert.

14:06.106 --> 14:09.065
Take that, Occam's razor.

14:09.065 --> 14:11.198
Grab a knife
and start chopping.

14:12.721 --> 14:14.592
Gosh, Frederick,
I'm so glad I came down today.

14:14.592 --> 14:17.204
- This has really been fun.
- Fun?

14:17.204 --> 14:19.075
Okay, well then, Dad,
you're missing the point,

14:19.075 --> 14:20.555
'cause our job is many things.

14:20.555 --> 14:23.732
It's challenging,
it's, uh, dangerous, heroic.

14:23.732 --> 14:25.952
But it's not fun.

14:25.952 --> 14:28.258
Whee!

14:30.957 --> 14:33.873
I can't believe you guys
get to sleep in bunk beds.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.614
And you have a dog?

14:36.614 --> 14:38.268
You're so lucky.

14:41.532 --> 14:43.273
<i>Medical distress call, male, 4,</i>

14:43.273 --> 14:44.971
<i>corner of 25th and Elm.</i>

14:44.971 --> 14:47.712
All right, Dad, perfect
opportunity to see me in action.

14:47.712 --> 14:50.237
Yes, but I-I can't leave
my cassoulet mid-braise.

14:50.237 --> 14:52.282
Its success
hangs in the balance.

14:52.282 --> 14:54.632
So does a man's life.
You want to see me save it?

14:54.632 --> 14:56.286
Yes, all right, all right,
all right. I'll just

14:56.286 --> 14:59.159
reduce it to a simmer,
a-a lazy simmer.

14:59.159 --> 15:01.465
Well, not so lazy
but, uh, uh, uh,

15:01.465 --> 15:03.206
languorous, but not idle.

15:03.206 --> 15:05.600
- Dad!
- Coming! I'm coming.

15:05.600 --> 15:08.385
- Can I come, too?
- Sorry, pal. Too dangerous.

15:08.385 --> 15:10.953
Besides, we need you to
keep an eye on the firehouse.

15:10.953 --> 15:11.954
Can you handle that?

15:11.954 --> 15:13.651
I'll do my best.

15:13.651 --> 15:15.392
Brave little bastard.

15:18.787 --> 15:21.181
All right, Dad, now,
things could get pretty hairy,

15:21.181 --> 15:23.357
so just hang back,
follow my lead.

15:24.140 --> 15:25.272
Boston Fire Department!

15:25.272 --> 15:27.752
Over here.

15:29.798 --> 15:31.669
Hi. Sorry.

15:31.669 --> 15:33.323
Uh, I lost my keys.

15:33.323 --> 15:35.891
I really thought
I could make it through.

15:35.891 --> 15:37.980
Damn my mother's hips.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.764
It's all right, sir.
Don't worry.

15:39.764 --> 15:41.331
We'll get you out of here
in no time.

15:41.331 --> 15:43.333
Moose, get the power saw.

15:43.333 --> 15:45.770
Whoa, power saw?
You're gonna cut me out?

15:45.770 --> 15:47.337
Don't worry, sir.
We're professionals.

15:47.337 --> 15:48.512
All right?
We'll get you through this.

15:48.512 --> 15:50.384
Yeah, easy for you to say.

15:50.384 --> 15:52.952
What happens if you
accidentally cut me in half?

15:52.952 --> 15:55.563
Oh, no. I think I'm having
another one of my panic attacks.

15:55.563 --> 15:57.913
Damn my mother's
anxiety disorder.

15:57.913 --> 16:00.655
Excuse me, sir.
Um, I'm not a firefighter,

16:00.655 --> 16:03.310
but I am a Harvard-educated
psychiatrist.

16:03.310 --> 16:05.834
Dad, please,
just let us do our thing.

16:05.834 --> 16:07.705
Are you Dr. Frasier Crane?

16:07.705 --> 16:09.707
F-From the TV?

16:09.707 --> 16:11.622
Guilty as charged.

16:11.622 --> 16:12.928
I'm a huge fan.

16:12.928 --> 16:14.016
I even bought your book,

16:14.016 --> 16:15.626
<i>A Crane Country Christmas.</i>

16:15.626 --> 16:17.193
- You got to be kidding me.
- You know,

16:17.193 --> 16:20.022
it's always nice to meet
the front half of a fan.

16:20.022 --> 16:21.981
So...

16:21.981 --> 16:23.852
we're gonna get you out of this.

16:23.852 --> 16:25.158
Finally,

16:25.158 --> 16:26.637
- a professional.
- Ah.

16:27.943 --> 16:30.163
I want you to take
some deep breaths with me.

16:34.471 --> 16:36.082
And tell me what you're feeling.

16:36.082 --> 16:38.606
Uh, sweaty palms.

16:38.606 --> 16:39.911
Heart's racing.

16:39.911 --> 16:41.261
I-I can't catch my breath.

16:41.261 --> 16:42.958
You know, I think
I know what's happening.

16:42.958 --> 16:46.135
You've never met a celebrity
of my caliber before.

16:48.616 --> 16:50.748
Oh, man.
Hey, would you look at this--

16:50.748 --> 16:52.402
you're making me
feel better already.

16:52.402 --> 16:54.230
It is the magic that is me.

16:55.797 --> 16:57.277
Hey, why are you here, anyway?

16:57.277 --> 16:59.105
Well, I'm doing a ride-along
with my son, Freddy.

16:59.105 --> 17:00.802
Oh.

17:00.802 --> 17:03.065
Must be a real kick for you
to see your dad do his thing.

17:19.255 --> 17:21.953
Wow, this is so cool.

17:21.953 --> 17:22.998
Thanks.

17:22.998 --> 17:24.217
No, thank <i>you.</i>

17:24.217 --> 17:26.654
You're a great
junior firefighter.

17:26.654 --> 17:29.570
And a life lesson
in overcoming obstacles.

17:30.397 --> 17:32.529
Well, this has been
the best day ever.

17:32.529 --> 17:34.836
Can't wait
to tell my mom all about it.

17:36.185 --> 17:37.143
Your mom's around?

17:37.143 --> 17:39.362
No, but I still talk to her.

17:40.146 --> 17:42.365
She's an angel.

17:44.628 --> 17:46.500
You keep it together, Smokey.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.719
Everyone, dinner is served.

17:48.719 --> 17:50.112
Whew, I'm starving.

17:50.112 --> 17:52.593
I felt guilty about eating
in front of that orphan.

17:52.593 --> 17:53.942
Mm.

17:53.942 --> 17:55.944
Yes, now, before we begin,

17:55.944 --> 17:57.337
nothing whets the appetite

17:57.337 --> 18:00.340
like a soupÃ§on
of historical context.

18:00.340 --> 18:03.343
The cassoulet is a humble
yet decadent dish

18:03.343 --> 18:05.693
that dates back
to 14th century France.

18:05.693 --> 18:07.216
Though some say
it's an adaptation

18:07.216 --> 18:09.392
of a Middle Eastern ragout.

18:10.698 --> 18:12.308
Okay, Dad,
everyone's kind of hungry.

18:12.308 --> 18:14.005
Right. Of course.
Oh, you know, but, first,

18:14.005 --> 18:15.790
a toast.

18:16.617 --> 18:18.749
I'd like to thank you for making
me a part of the team, Freddy.

18:18.749 --> 18:20.186
I've really gotten
great enjoyment

18:20.186 --> 18:22.449
out of getting to know
your fraternity.

18:23.754 --> 18:25.800
- Fraternity?
- Mm.

18:25.800 --> 18:28.411
Wait, this is like
some kind of frat house?

18:29.238 --> 18:31.066
I don't mean
to put words in his mouth,

18:31.066 --> 18:32.676
but my guess
is he meant "fraternity"

18:32.676 --> 18:35.549
as in the French <i>fraternitÃ©,</i>
meaning brotherhood.

18:35.549 --> 18:37.377
Yes, exactly, Tiny.
The-the laughter,

18:37.377 --> 18:38.726
the camaraderie, the fun.

18:38.726 --> 18:41.424
This job is not
all about having fun.

18:41.424 --> 18:44.384
Except on Sunday Fundays
when we have hot fudge sundaes.

18:45.472 --> 18:47.691
Why do you keep belittling
what we do here?

18:47.691 --> 18:49.215
What is the matter

18:49.215 --> 18:50.912
with you?
I'm sorry.

18:50.912 --> 18:52.479
I'm just frustrated. Okay?

18:52.479 --> 18:54.176
I was hoping that by coming
down, spending a day here,

18:54.176 --> 18:56.526
you may finally
take my job seriously.

18:56.526 --> 18:58.049
I do take your job seriously.

18:58.049 --> 18:59.399
I think it's very noble,

18:59.399 --> 19:01.401
- what you all do.
- Oh, so it's just me then?

19:01.401 --> 19:02.924
'Cause you never ask me
about my job.

19:02.924 --> 19:04.273
You're always hinting
about other careers for me.

19:04.273 --> 19:05.970
I just... I don't get it.

19:05.970 --> 19:08.582
Why do you have such a problem
with me being a firefighter?

19:08.582 --> 19:11.411
I don't have a-a problem
with it, exactly.

19:11.411 --> 19:12.629
I-I think...

19:12.629 --> 19:13.891
<i>Four-alarm fire.</i>

19:13.891 --> 19:15.458
<i>904 Baker Street.</i>

19:15.458 --> 19:16.807
<i>Commercial warehouse.</i>

19:16.807 --> 19:17.808
<i>Hazardous materials.</i>

19:17.808 --> 19:18.809
Four-alarm?!

19:18.809 --> 19:20.681
That's a lot, right?

19:20.681 --> 19:23.771
Yeah, Dad. All right, this is
a big one, guys. Watch your six.

19:23.771 --> 19:25.120
When will you be back?

19:25.120 --> 19:26.643
I don't know. Just...

19:26.643 --> 19:28.167
You should go home.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.739
Oh.

19:35.739 --> 19:37.306
What the hell.

19:37.306 --> 19:39.265
Somebody might as well enjoy it.

19:40.266 --> 19:41.832
Knock yourself out.

19:47.708 --> 19:49.318
Ah, Eve.

19:49.318 --> 19:51.712
You probably thought this "all's
well that ends well" business

19:51.712 --> 19:53.192
had all ended.

19:53.975 --> 19:54.932
Well...

19:54.932 --> 19:56.760
Prepare to eat crow.

19:56.760 --> 19:59.937
Because after we are done
with our presentation,

19:59.937 --> 20:02.853
there will be no doubt
in your mind that Middleton

20:02.853 --> 20:05.987
is the author of
the so-called Shakespeare quote.

20:05.987 --> 20:07.336
Item one:

20:07.336 --> 20:09.208
this passage
in his <i>Revenger's Tragedy,</i>

20:09.208 --> 20:12.472
which you will see the language
is startlingly similar.

20:12.472 --> 20:13.995
I know I was startled.

20:13.995 --> 20:17.955
And after I am done with
my third carousel of slides,

20:17.955 --> 20:19.261
you will be convinced...

20:19.261 --> 20:20.523
If you leave right now,
I'll give you

20:20.523 --> 20:22.395
a half-off coupon
for your next drink.

20:22.395 --> 20:24.440
- You have a deal.
- It's honestly more
than I thought we would get.

20:26.703 --> 20:28.923
<i>Firefighters were able
to get employees out</i>

20:28.923 --> 20:30.316
<i>before the roof caved in.</i>

20:30.316 --> 20:32.187
<i>But it's still
a very active scene,</i>

20:32.187 --> 20:35.582
<i>and at least one person
has been taken to the hospital.</i>

20:39.455 --> 20:42.502
You know, people
watch these things on TV.

20:42.502 --> 20:45.331
They don't realize
what it's like to watch...

20:45.331 --> 20:48.725
someone you love
put their life on the line to...

20:48.725 --> 20:50.379
Oh, Eve, uh...

20:50.379 --> 20:51.685
that was insensitive of me.

20:51.685 --> 20:53.600
- Your boyfriend...
- No, it's fine.

20:54.514 --> 20:56.255
I think about him all the time,

20:56.255 --> 20:58.779
whether I'm reminded of him
or not.

20:58.779 --> 21:00.346
And that's good.

21:00.346 --> 21:02.348
I love thinking about him.

21:04.132 --> 21:06.395
Tell me, what was he like?

21:08.702 --> 21:10.269
Well,

21:10.269 --> 21:12.401
Adam...

21:12.401 --> 21:15.230
Yeah, we were Adam and Eve.

21:17.363 --> 21:19.669
He was a huge Bruins fan.

21:19.669 --> 21:21.802
He made a killer
beer can chicken.

21:21.802 --> 21:23.238
He thought that

21:23.238 --> 21:26.241
wearing cardigan sweaters
made him look smarter.

21:27.851 --> 21:29.288
They did.

21:29.288 --> 21:32.247
And he loved
being a firefighter.

21:32.247 --> 21:33.814
And I loved that he loved it.

21:33.814 --> 21:36.773
And I hated that I was worried
about him all the time.

21:36.773 --> 21:39.080
Wow.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.124
What?

21:40.951 --> 21:43.606
You just took me back
to my childhood.

21:44.477 --> 21:46.696
My father was a police officer.

21:46.696 --> 21:49.177
And when he would work late,
my brother and I would...

21:49.177 --> 21:51.919
lie in bed,
staring at the ceiling.

21:51.919 --> 21:54.574
Wondering if we'd ever
see him again.

21:55.488 --> 21:57.359
To console ourselves, we'd...

21:57.359 --> 21:59.361
we'd take a big flashlight

21:59.361 --> 22:01.494
and make
a-a shadow puppet rendition

22:01.494 --> 22:04.235
of Gilbert and Sullivan's
<i>The Mikado.</i>

22:06.194 --> 22:08.283
Of course,
Niles was younger than I,

22:08.283 --> 22:11.199
so I would let him play
Nanki-Poo.

22:12.156 --> 22:13.419
Aw.

22:14.289 --> 22:16.117
You were really weird kids, huh?

22:16.117 --> 22:18.119
You have no idea.

22:19.990 --> 22:22.428
And now, decades later,
I have a son who's...

22:22.428 --> 22:24.299
chosen the one job
more dangerous

22:24.299 --> 22:26.606
than being a police officer.

22:26.606 --> 22:29.609
Is that why you don't like
him being a firefighter?

22:29.609 --> 22:32.046
You know, he thinks it's
because you don't respect him.

22:32.046 --> 22:34.135
No, of course I respect him.

22:34.135 --> 22:35.310
I'm...

22:35.310 --> 22:36.790
I couldn't be...

22:36.790 --> 22:38.182
prouder of him.

22:39.749 --> 22:41.838
Should have seen him taking
charge at the station today,

22:41.838 --> 22:43.362
and...

22:43.362 --> 22:45.146
now I know he's out...

22:45.146 --> 22:46.887
risking his life
to save other people.

22:46.887 --> 22:48.976
It's...

22:48.976 --> 22:50.456
It's just...

22:50.456 --> 22:51.805
a lot easier to deal with

22:51.805 --> 22:54.068
when I was living
a thousand miles away.

22:54.895 --> 22:56.462
Why don't you
talk to Freddy about this?

22:56.462 --> 22:59.160
I don't think that'd be fair.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.598
He's got enough to worry about
with his job.

23:03.643 --> 23:05.340
I don't want him
to have to worry about...

23:05.340 --> 23:07.168
my fears as well.

23:07.168 --> 23:08.474
I get it.

23:08.474 --> 23:10.301
But can I give you some advice?

23:10.301 --> 23:11.868
Of course.

23:11.868 --> 23:13.479
You know how

23:13.479 --> 23:15.568
sometimes, in a movie,

23:15.568 --> 23:18.397
monsters are scarier
when you can't see them?

23:19.310 --> 23:21.661
Well, maybe if you talk
to Freddy about his job,

23:21.661 --> 23:23.793
then you won't be
so scared for him.

23:23.793 --> 23:26.840
And he'll get the emotional
support that he needs.

23:28.102 --> 23:29.843
Eve, you are a wise woman.

23:29.843 --> 23:31.018
Mm.

23:31.018 --> 23:32.411
Really?

23:33.237 --> 23:34.935
Wow.

23:34.935 --> 23:36.458
Look at me.

23:36.458 --> 23:39.200
I'm giving psychology advice
to Dr. Frasier Crane.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.071
Yes, you are.

23:41.071 --> 23:43.422
Anything else
I can help you with?

23:44.205 --> 23:45.772
I'm listening.

23:46.729 --> 23:48.557
Very cute.

23:48.557 --> 23:49.950
Hmm.

23:49.950 --> 23:52.474
I do wonder if your relationship
issues with women

23:52.474 --> 23:54.737
- stem from a lack of...
- Let's not push it.

24:00.526 --> 24:01.918
Dad?

24:02.702 --> 24:03.964
It's almost 5:00 in the morning.

24:03.964 --> 24:05.139
You been up all night?

24:05.139 --> 24:06.488
No, no, no. I-I got up early.

24:06.488 --> 24:08.403
Thought I'd get a head start
on things.

24:08.403 --> 24:09.926
Still wearing the same clothes?

24:10.797 --> 24:13.364
Oh, so now you can
put two and two together.

24:14.714 --> 24:16.063
I, uh...

24:16.063 --> 24:17.543
I made some
of your famous chili.

24:17.543 --> 24:21.068
I followed the recipe
to the letter.

24:21.068 --> 24:22.504
Though I'm not exactly sure

24:22.504 --> 24:25.681
how much a "buttload"
of ground beef is.

24:26.856 --> 24:27.944
I took a stab.

24:27.944 --> 24:29.380
Here, here, sit.

24:29.380 --> 24:32.166
Let me-let me get you a beer.

24:36.910 --> 24:39.216
So, how was it?

24:41.958 --> 24:42.916
The fire.

24:42.916 --> 24:44.178
Uh...

24:44.178 --> 24:45.701
you really want to know?

24:45.701 --> 24:47.094
Yes, of course.

24:47.094 --> 24:48.791
Okay.

24:48.791 --> 24:50.227
Well, uh...

24:51.141 --> 24:52.534
When we get there, I...

24:52.534 --> 24:55.232
you know,
I do a quick 360 and...

24:55.232 --> 24:57.887
size up the situation.
And, uh...

24:57.887 --> 25:00.499
well, I notice that the...

25:01.630 --> 25:02.849
Uh, Dad?

25:05.329 --> 25:07.157
Go on.

25:08.507 --> 25:09.856
Dad, it's...

25:09.856 --> 25:11.335
It's okay. I'm fine. I survived.

25:11.335 --> 25:13.294
No, it's the chili.

25:16.297 --> 25:18.342
My mouth is a portal
to the fiery pits of hell.

25:19.909 --> 25:21.476
I didn't think it'd be so spicy.

25:21.476 --> 25:24.435
Didn't the "crap-ton"
of jalapenos give you a clue?

25:25.393 --> 25:26.960
Out of the carton?

25:26.960 --> 25:27.874
Do you want it or not?

25:35.142 --> 25:36.622
Well, it's...

25:36.622 --> 25:38.798
That's better.

25:39.755 --> 25:40.713
Mmm.

25:40.713 --> 25:42.541
Go on.

25:43.411 --> 25:44.760
Oh.

25:44.760 --> 25:46.545
Okay, so, like I was saying,

25:46.545 --> 25:48.329
the roof's about to go,
so we need the ladder truck

25:48.329 --> 25:50.244
to get over the house, right?

25:50.244 --> 25:53.377
So I get Tiny
and then Smokey and...

25:53.377 --> 25:55.031
Oh, that reminds me-- uh,

25:55.031 --> 25:56.990
they asked me
what David's favorite color is.

25:56.990 --> 25:59.514
They want to buy him a bike.
Any idea what that's about?

26:01.168 --> 26:02.822
Well, uh,

26:02.822 --> 26:05.215
we knock the door in
and we're gonna, you know,

26:05.215 --> 26:06.565
do a sweep for civilians, right?

26:06.565 --> 26:08.001
Did you find any?

26:08.001 --> 26:09.785
Not at first, but then...

26:17.488 --> 26:19.839
<i>Y'all know how this goes.</i>

26:20.753 --> 26:22.798
<i>âª Hey, baby,
I hear the blues a-callin'âª</i>

26:22.798 --> 26:26.628
<i>âª Tossed salads
and scrambled eggs âª</i>

26:28.151 --> 26:30.632
<i>âª And maybe I seem
a bit confused âª</i>

26:30.632 --> 26:33.896
<i>Yeah, maybe.
But I got you pegged.</i>

26:35.419 --> 26:37.421
<i>âª But I don't know what to do âª</i>

26:37.421 --> 26:41.600
<i>âª With those tossed salads
and scrambled eggs âª</i>

26:43.166 --> 26:45.560
<i>âª Life's callin' again. âª</i>

26:50.826 --> 26:52.785
<i>Frasier is back.</i>

26:52.785 --> 26:54.787
<i>Back in Boston.</i>

26:54.787 --> 26:56.702
<i>Good night!</i>
