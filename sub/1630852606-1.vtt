WEBVTT

00:37.410 --> 00:41.290
When shall we three meet again?

00:41.370 --> 00:45.830
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?

00:45.920 --> 00:49.250
When the hurly-burly's done.

00:49.340 --> 00:53.300
When the battle's lost and won.

00:53.380 --> 00:54.800
Where the place?

00:54.880 --> 00:56.390
Upon the heath.

00:56.970 --> 01:00.640
There to meet with Macbeth.

01:01.140 --> 01:05.690
Fair is foul, and foul is fair.

01:06.400 --> 01:11.190
Hover through the fog and filthy air.

02:26.140 --> 02:27.940
Hail, brave friend.

02:28.850 --> 02:32.440
Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
as though didst leave it.

02:33.270 --> 02:34.650
Doubtful it stood.

02:35.690 --> 02:39.530
As two spent swimmers that do
cling together and choke their art.

02:40.360 --> 02:41.780
The merciless Macdonwald,

02:42.370 --> 02:44.490
with fortune on his
damned quarrel smiling,

02:44.580 --> 02:46.620
showed like a rebel's whore.

02:47.410 --> 02:48.960
But all's too weak.

02:49.040 --> 02:51.920
For brave Macbeth--
well he deserves that name--

02:52.000 --> 02:56.340
discerning fortune, with his brandished
steel which smoked with bloody execution,

02:56.420 --> 03:00.050
like valor's minion carved out
his passage till he faced the slave.

03:01.470 --> 03:04.300
Which ne'er shook hands,
nor bade farewell to him,

03:04.390 --> 03:07.720
till he unseamed him
from the nave to the chops

03:07.810 --> 03:09.640
and fixed his head upon our battlements.

03:10.230 --> 03:12.980
Valiant cousin. Worthy gentleman.

03:13.060 --> 03:14.860
No sooner justice had with valor armed

03:14.940 --> 03:17.940
compelled these skipping kerns
to trust their heels…

03:19.280 --> 03:23.070
but the Norwegian lord, surveying vantage,
with furbished arms

03:23.160 --> 03:25.410
and new supplies of men
began a fresh assault.

03:25.490 --> 03:28.290
Dismayed not this our captains,
Macbeth and Banquo?

03:28.910 --> 03:29.910
Yes.

03:31.710 --> 03:36.250
As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.

03:36.340 --> 03:39.010
So they doubly redoubled
strokes upon the foe.

03:39.840 --> 03:41.130
I cannot tell.

03:43.510 --> 03:45.010
My gashes cry for help.

03:49.770 --> 03:50.930
God save the king.

03:51.850 --> 03:53.980
Whence cam'st thou, worthy Thane?

03:54.060 --> 03:56.230
From Fife, great King,

03:56.320 --> 04:00.190
where the Norwegian banners
flout the sky and fan our people cold.

04:00.280 --> 04:07.120
Norway himself, with terrible numbers,
assisted by that most disloyal traitor,

04:07.200 --> 04:10.660
the Thane of Cawdor,
began a dismal conflict.

04:11.330 --> 04:14.960
Till that Macbeth and Banquo,
lapped in proof,

04:15.040 --> 04:17.670
confronted him with self-comparisons.

04:18.250 --> 04:23.340
Point against point rebellious, arm
'gainst arm, curbing his lavish spirit.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.050
And, to conclude…

04:26.260 --> 04:27.470
the victory fell to us.

04:27.550 --> 04:28.850
Great happiness.

04:29.850 --> 04:33.140
No more the Thane of Cawdor
shall deceive our bosom interest.

04:33.230 --> 04:35.190
-No.
-Go pronounce his present death.

04:35.270 --> 04:36.360
I'll see it done.

04:36.440 --> 04:37.810
And with his former title…

04:39.070 --> 04:40.320
greet Macbeth.

05:14.230 --> 05:16.690
Where hast thou been, sister?

05:18.230 --> 05:19.860
Killing swine.

05:22.070 --> 05:25.200
Sister, where thou?

05:27.530 --> 05:28.990
Look what I have.

05:29.490 --> 05:31.620
Show me. Show me!

05:32.620 --> 05:39.080
Here I have a sailor's thumb,
wrecked as homeward he did come.

05:41.170 --> 05:43.800
A drum. A drum!

05:45.050 --> 05:46.630
Macbeth doth come.

05:47.550 --> 05:48.930
Aye.

05:49.760 --> 05:52.010
In a sieve I'll thither sail.

05:52.100 --> 05:55.980
And, like a rat without a tail,
I'll do, I'll do and I'll do.

05:57.060 --> 06:00.650
I'll drain him dry as hay.

06:01.770 --> 06:05.360
Sleep shall neither night nor day…

06:05.440 --> 06:08.110
hang upon his penthouse lid.

06:08.200 --> 06:11.410
He shall live a man forbid.

06:12.200 --> 06:16.290
Weary sennights nine times nine

06:16.370 --> 06:20.380
shall he dwindle, peak and pine.

06:20.460 --> 06:24.050
The weird sisters, hand in hand.

06:24.130 --> 06:27.340
Posters of the sea and land.

06:27.420 --> 06:30.050
Thus do go about, about.

06:30.140 --> 06:33.390
Thrice to thine and thrice to mine.

06:33.470 --> 06:35.520
And thrice again to make up--

06:37.600 --> 06:38.690
Nine.

07:00.460 --> 07:01.460
Peace.

07:02.710 --> 07:04.590
The charm's wound up.

07:09.720 --> 07:13.800
So foul and fair a day I have not seen.

07:15.350 --> 07:16.970
How far is it to Forres?

07:22.480 --> 07:25.520
What are these? So withered
and so wild in their attire,

07:25.610 --> 07:28.820
that look not like the inhabitants
of the earth, and yet are on it.

07:28.900 --> 07:31.110
Live you?
Or are you aught that man may question?

07:33.070 --> 07:36.910
Speak, if you can. What are you?

07:39.200 --> 07:40.790
All hail, Macbeth.

07:41.420 --> 07:43.500
Hail to thee, Thane of Glamis.

07:43.580 --> 07:48.130
All hail, Macbeth.
Hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!

07:50.010 --> 07:51.720
All hail, Macbeth.

07:52.680 --> 07:55.930
That shalt be king hereafter.

07:57.680 --> 08:00.770
Are ye fantastical?
Or that indeed which outwardly ye show?

08:01.520 --> 08:03.270
If you can look into the seeds of time

08:03.350 --> 08:06.190
and say which grain will grow
and which will not,

08:06.270 --> 08:09.690
speak then to me, who neither beg
nor fear your favor nor your hate.

08:09.780 --> 08:12.490
Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.

08:13.240 --> 08:17.030
Not so happy, yet much happier.

08:18.240 --> 08:23.000
Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none.

08:24.630 --> 08:27.040
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo.

08:27.130 --> 08:29.880
Banquo and Macbeth.

08:31.800 --> 08:33.419
All hail.

08:37.760 --> 08:40.020
Stay, you imperfect speakers.
Tell me more.

08:41.850 --> 08:44.940
I know I am Thane of Glamis,
but how of Cawdor?

08:45.020 --> 08:47.770
The Thane of Cawdor lives,
a prosperous gentleman.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.650
And to be king stands not
within the prospect of belief.

08:50.730 --> 08:52.990
Say from whence you owe
this strange intelligence?

08:53.070 --> 08:57.490
Or why upon this blasted heath you stop
our way with such prophetic greeting?

09:12.420 --> 09:14.880
The earth hath bubbles, as the water has.

09:14.970 --> 09:18.510
And these are of them.
Whither are they vanished?

09:19.220 --> 09:22.430
And what seemed corporal melted
as breath into the wind.

09:23.480 --> 09:24.850
Would they had stayed.

09:41.160 --> 09:43.500
Were such things here
as we do speak about?

09:44.410 --> 09:48.880
Or have we eaten on the insane root
that takes the reason prisoner?

09:49.630 --> 09:51.170
Your children shall be kings.

09:51.250 --> 09:52.960
You shall be king.

09:53.050 --> 09:56.720
And Thane of Cawdor too. Went it not so?

09:58.720 --> 10:00.680
To the selfsame tune and words.

10:19.450 --> 10:20.570
Who goes there?

10:28.370 --> 10:32.880
The king hath happily received, Macbeth,
the news of thy success.

10:32.960 --> 10:37.470
And when he reads thy personal venture
in the rebels' fight,

10:37.550 --> 10:42.180
his wonders and his praises do contend
which should be thine or his.

10:42.260 --> 10:45.180
We are sent to give thee
from our royal master thanks.

10:45.270 --> 10:48.230
Only to herald thee into his sight,
not pay thee.

10:48.310 --> 10:53.020
And, for an earnest of a greater honor,

10:53.110 --> 10:56.530
he bade me, from him,
call thee Thane of Cawdor.

10:57.740 --> 11:03.240
In which addition,
hail, most worthy Thane.

11:04.120 --> 11:05.290
For it is thine.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.330
What, can the devil speak true?

11:08.410 --> 11:12.250
The Thane of Cawdor lives.
Why do you dress me in borrowed robes?

11:12.330 --> 11:15.500
Who was the thane lives yet,

11:16.340 --> 11:21.930
but under heavy judgment bears that life
which he deserves to lose.

11:22.510 --> 11:25.760
Whether he was combined
with those of Norway,

11:25.850 --> 11:28.810
or did line the rebel
with hidden help and vantage,

11:28.890 --> 11:33.150
or that with both he labored
in his country's wrack, I know not.

11:33.230 --> 11:38.110
But treasons capital,
confessed and proved…

11:40.490 --> 11:41.820
have overthrown him.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.670
Thanks for your pains.

11:56.250 --> 11:58.090
Glamis and Thane of Cawdor.

11:59.300 --> 12:01.720
The greatest is behind.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.800
Do you not hope
your children shall be kings?

12:03.890 --> 12:07.140
When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor
to me promised no less to them?

12:07.220 --> 12:11.390
That trusted home might yet
enkindle you unto the crown,

12:11.480 --> 12:13.350
besides the Thane of Cawdor.

12:13.440 --> 12:15.020
But 'tis strange.

12:15.810 --> 12:18.440
And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,

12:19.360 --> 12:21.820
the instruments
of darkness tell us truths,

12:21.900 --> 12:27.030
win us with honest trifles,
to betray us in deepest consequence.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.500
This supernatural soliciting
cannot be ill, cannot be good.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.300
If ill, why hath it given me earnest
of success, commencing in a truth?

12:42.380 --> 12:44.550
I am Thane of Cawdor.

12:48.260 --> 12:52.730
If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
whose horrid image doth unfix my hair

12:52.810 --> 12:56.610
and make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
against the use of nature?

13:03.320 --> 13:06.070
Present fears are less
than horrible imaginings.

13:06.820 --> 13:09.030
My thought, whose murder
yet is but fantastical,

13:09.120 --> 13:13.370
shakes so my single state of
man that function is smothered in surmise,

13:14.160 --> 13:16.290
and nothing is, but what is not.

13:17.790 --> 13:22.550
If chance will have me king, why,
chance may crown me without my stir.

13:26.890 --> 13:28.300
Come what come may.

13:29.890 --> 13:32.350
Time and the hour runs
through the roughest day.

13:35.390 --> 13:37.690
"They met me in the day of success.

13:37.770 --> 13:39.730
And I have learned
by the perfectest report,

13:39.820 --> 13:42.280
they have more in them
than mortal knowledge.

13:42.820 --> 13:45.400
When I burned in desire
to question them further,

13:45.490 --> 13:48.570
they made themselves air,
into which they vanished.

13:49.070 --> 13:51.240
Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it,

13:51.330 --> 13:56.000
came missives from the king,
who all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor,'

13:56.080 --> 13:58.920
by which title, before,
these weird sisters saluted me

13:59.000 --> 14:04.130
and referred me to the coming on of time,
with 'Hail, king that shalt be.'

14:06.930 --> 14:10.800
This have I thought good to deliver thee,
my dearest partner of greatness,

14:10.890 --> 14:13.310
that thou mightst not lose
the dues of rejoicing

14:13.390 --> 14:16.810
by being ignorant of what
greatness is promised thee.

14:18.230 --> 14:20.440
Lay it to thy heart, and farewell."

14:26.070 --> 14:29.240
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor.

14:29.910 --> 14:32.530
And shalt be what thou art promised.

14:33.870 --> 14:35.580
Yet do I fear thy nature.

14:36.080 --> 14:40.710
It is too full of the milk of
human kindness to catch the nearest way.

14:42.420 --> 14:43.630
Thou wouldst be great.

14:43.710 --> 14:48.130
Art not without ambition,
but without the illness should attend it.

14:50.010 --> 14:53.720
What thou wouldst highly,
that wouldst thou holily.

14:53.810 --> 14:58.020
Wouldst not play false,
and yet wouldst wrongly win.

15:03.110 --> 15:05.110
Hie thee hither,

15:06.400 --> 15:09.450
that I may pour my spirits in thine ear.

15:09.530 --> 15:12.120
And chastise with the valor of my tongue

15:12.200 --> 15:15.620
all that impedes thee
from the golden round.

15:36.310 --> 15:38.480
Is execution done on Cawdor?

15:38.560 --> 15:39.600
My liege.

15:40.690 --> 15:43.270
I have spoke with one that saw him die,

15:43.360 --> 15:46.980
who did report that very frankly
he confessed his treasons,

15:47.070 --> 15:51.410
implored Your Highness's pardon
and set forth a deep repentance.

15:51.490 --> 15:55.280
Nothing in his life became him
like the leaving it.

15:55.370 --> 15:59.290
He died as one that
had been studied in his death

15:59.370 --> 16:03.330
to throw away the dearest thing he owed,
as 'twere a careless trifle.

16:04.170 --> 16:08.010
There's no art to find
the mind's construction in the face.

16:09.760 --> 16:14.680
He was a gentleman
on whom I built an absolute trust.

16:17.220 --> 16:18.930
O worthiest cousin.

16:20.180 --> 16:23.310
The sin of my ingratitude
even now was heavy on me.

16:24.650 --> 16:29.030
Only I have left to say, more is thy due
than more than all can pay.

16:29.110 --> 16:32.570
The service and the loyalty I owe,
in doing it, pays itself.

16:32.650 --> 16:34.160
Welcome hither.

16:36.620 --> 16:41.210
I have begun to plant thee and will labor
to make thee full of growing.

16:44.370 --> 16:47.460
Noble Banquo, that hast no less deserved,

16:47.540 --> 16:49.460
nor must be known no less to have done so,

16:49.550 --> 16:52.630
let me enfold thee
and hold thee to my heart.

16:52.720 --> 16:55.510
There if I grow, the harvest is your own.

16:55.590 --> 16:57.890
My plenteous joys, wanton in fullness,

16:57.970 --> 17:00.600
seek to hide themselves
in drops of sorrow.

17:05.099 --> 17:09.109
Sons, kinsmen, thanes,

17:09.819 --> 17:11.690
and you whose places are the nearest,

17:11.780 --> 17:17.619
know we will establish our estate
upon our eldest, Malcolm…

17:18.450 --> 17:20.450
whom we name hereafter

17:20.540 --> 17:21.790
prince of Cumberland.

17:22.540 --> 17:26.079
Which honor must not
unaccompanied invest him only,

17:27.790 --> 17:32.970
but signs of nobleness, like stars,
shall shine on all deservers.

17:34.050 --> 17:36.970
From hence to Inverness,
and bind us further to you.

17:38.760 --> 17:41.810
I'll be myself the harbinger
and make joyful

17:41.890 --> 17:46.520
the hearing of my wife with your approach,
so humbly take my leave.

17:46.600 --> 17:47.980
My worthy Cawdor.

17:48.060 --> 17:51.980
Let's after him, whose care is gone before
to bid us welcome.

17:52.070 --> 17:53.320
It is a peerless kinsman.

17:54.530 --> 17:56.030
Prince of Cumberland.

17:57.410 --> 18:00.200
That is a step on which
I must fall down, or else o'erleap,

18:00.280 --> 18:02.160
for in my way it lies.

18:02.700 --> 18:04.790
Stars, hide your fires.

18:05.460 --> 18:09.170
Let not light see
my black and deep desires.

18:10.040 --> 18:12.550
The king comes here tonight.

18:12.630 --> 18:15.970
Thou art mad to say it.
Is not thy master with him?

18:16.050 --> 18:19.180
So please you, it is true.
Our thane is coming.

18:19.260 --> 18:21.050
One of my fellows had the speed of him.

18:21.640 --> 18:25.310
Give him tending. He brings great news.

18:30.060 --> 18:32.270
The raven himself is hoarse

18:32.360 --> 18:37.110
that croaks the fatal entrance
of Duncan under my battlements.

18:42.660 --> 18:45.910
Come, you spirits
that tend on mortal thoughts.

18:46.710 --> 18:49.080
Unsex me here,

18:50.380 --> 18:55.300
and fill me from the crown to the toe
topful of direst cruelty.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.010
Make thick my blood.

18:59.010 --> 19:02.180
Stop up the access and passage to remorse,

19:02.260 --> 19:06.390
that no compunctious visitings of nature
shake my fell purpose,

19:06.480 --> 19:09.310
nor keep peace between the effect and it.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.440
Come to my woman's breasts

19:13.520 --> 19:18.070
and take my milk for gall,
you murdering ministers,

19:19.200 --> 19:23.200
wherever in your sightless substances
you wait on nature's mischief.

19:24.280 --> 19:29.040
Come, thick night, and pall thee
in the dunnest smoke of hell,

19:30.000 --> 19:33.090
that my keen knife see not
the wound it makes,

19:33.170 --> 19:38.090
nor heaven peep through the blanket
of the dark to cry, "Hold. Hold."

19:50.440 --> 19:52.560
Great Glamis.

19:59.190 --> 20:00.820
Worthy Cawdor.

20:02.990 --> 20:05.620
Greater than both,
by the all-hail hereafter.

20:09.040 --> 20:12.420
Thy letters have transported me
beyond this ignorant present,

20:12.500 --> 20:15.790
and I feel now the future in the instant.

20:15.880 --> 20:17.800
My dearest love.

20:25.430 --> 20:27.060
Duncan comes here tonight.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.220
And when goes hence?

20:29.310 --> 20:31.100
Tomorrow, as he purposes.

20:31.770 --> 20:34.060
Never shall sun that morrow see.

20:38.900 --> 20:43.950
Your face, my Thane, is as a book
where men may read strange matters.

20:44.910 --> 20:47.410
To beguile the time, look like the time.

20:48.160 --> 20:51.000
Bear welcome in your eye,
your hand, your tongue.

20:51.540 --> 20:54.790
Look like the innocent flower,
but be the serpent under it.

20:56.460 --> 20:58.380
He that's coming must be provided for.

20:58.460 --> 21:01.920
And you shall put this night's
great business into my dispatch.

21:02.630 --> 21:05.180
Which shall to all our nights
and days to come

21:05.260 --> 21:08.760
give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.

21:17.230 --> 21:18.730
Only look up clear.

21:19.820 --> 21:21.990
To alter favor ever is to fear.

21:24.360 --> 21:25.740
Leave all the rest to me.

21:32.080 --> 21:34.040
This castle hath a pleasant seat.

21:34.710 --> 21:38.500
The air nimbly and sweetly recommends
itself unto our gentle senses.

21:40.500 --> 21:44.340
This guest of summer,
temple-haunting martlet,

21:44.420 --> 21:46.680
does approve, by his loved mansionry,

21:46.760 --> 21:49.510
that the heaven's breath
smells wooingly here.

21:50.010 --> 21:52.680
No jutty, frieze, buttress,
nor coign of vantage,

21:52.770 --> 21:56.350
but this bird hath made his pendent bed
and procreant cradle.

21:57.310 --> 22:01.150
Where they most breed and haunt,
I have observed, the air is delicate.

22:01.230 --> 22:04.570
See, see, our honored hostess.

22:04.650 --> 22:09.030
All our service in every point twice done
and then done double

22:09.120 --> 22:13.370
were poor and single business to contend
against those honors deep and broad

22:13.450 --> 22:16.040
wherewith Your Majesty loads our house.

22:16.120 --> 22:17.460
Where is the Thane of Cawdor?

22:17.540 --> 22:20.500
We coursed him at the heels,
and had a purpose to be his purveyor.

22:20.590 --> 22:23.960
But he rides well.
And his great love, sharp as his spur,

22:24.050 --> 22:26.130
hath helped him to his home before us.

22:27.220 --> 22:30.010
Fair and noble hostess,
we are your guest tonight.

22:30.100 --> 22:31.560
Give me your hand.

22:33.970 --> 22:35.430
Conduct me to mine host.

22:41.820 --> 22:47.150
If it were done when 'tis done,
then 'twere well it were done quickly.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.820
If the assassination could
trammel up the consequence,

22:50.910 --> 22:53.200
and catch with his surcease success,

22:53.290 --> 22:56.790
that but this blow might be
the be-all and the end-all here.

22:58.620 --> 23:00.210
But here…

23:01.840 --> 23:05.010
upon this bank and shoal of time,
we'd jump the life to come.

23:08.510 --> 23:10.930
But in these cases
we still have judgment here.

23:11.010 --> 23:13.140
That we but teach bloody instructions,

23:13.220 --> 23:16.640
which, being taught,
return to plague the inventor.

23:17.560 --> 23:19.350
This evenhanded justice commends

23:19.440 --> 23:23.190
the ingredience of our poisoned chalice
to our own lips.

23:25.690 --> 23:27.280
He's here in double trust.

23:28.780 --> 23:30.860
First, as I am his kinsman
and his subject,

23:30.950 --> 23:32.870
strong both against the deed.

23:34.200 --> 23:35.740
Then, as his host,

23:36.580 --> 23:40.370
who should against his murderer
shut the door, not bear the knife myself.

23:40.870 --> 23:43.920
Besides, this Duncan hath borne
his faculties so meek,

23:44.000 --> 23:46.340
hath been so clear in his great office,

23:47.460 --> 23:50.050
that his virtues will plead like angels,
trumpet-tongued,

23:50.130 --> 23:52.260
against the deep damnation
of his taking-off.

23:52.340 --> 23:55.560
And pity, like a naked newborn babe,
striding the blast,

23:55.640 --> 23:59.520
or heaven's cherubim, horsed upon
the sightless couriers of the air,

23:59.600 --> 24:04.110
shall blow this horrid deed in every eye,
that tears shall drown the wind.

24:06.110 --> 24:09.070
I have no spur to prick
the sides of my intent…

24:10.990 --> 24:14.990
only vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps
itself and falls on the other.

24:20.830 --> 24:22.540
How now. What news?

24:24.880 --> 24:26.210
He has almost supped.

24:26.300 --> 24:28.010
Hath he asked for me?

24:28.090 --> 24:29.460
Know you not he has?

24:31.220 --> 24:32.970
We will proceed no further
in this business.

24:33.050 --> 24:34.140
He hath honored me of late.

24:34.220 --> 24:36.970
And I have bought golden opinions
from all sorts of people,

24:37.060 --> 24:39.730
which would be worn now
in their newest gloss,

24:40.810 --> 24:43.560
not cast aside so soon.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.900
Was the hope drunk
wherein you dressed yourself?

24:46.980 --> 24:48.110
Hath it slept since?

24:48.190 --> 24:51.400
And wakes it now, to look so green
and pale at what it did so freely?

24:51.490 --> 24:53.820
From this time such I account thy love.

24:56.620 --> 25:01.330
Art thou afeard to be the same in thine
own act and valor as thou art in desire?

25:01.410 --> 25:05.170
Wouldst thou have that which thou
esteem'st the ornament of life,

25:05.250 --> 25:07.380
and live a coward in thine own esteem,

25:07.460 --> 25:10.920
letting "I dare not" wait upon "I would,"
like the poor cat in the adage?

25:11.010 --> 25:13.430
Prithee, peace.

25:14.380 --> 25:19.260
I dare do all that may become a man.
Who dares do more is none.

25:19.350 --> 25:22.350
What beast was't, then,
made you break this enterprise to me?

25:23.190 --> 25:25.980
When you durst do it, then you were a man.

25:26.060 --> 25:29.530
And, to be more than what you were,
you would be so much more the man.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.610
I have given suck,

25:32.690 --> 25:36.200
and know how tender 'tis
to love the babe that milks me.

25:36.280 --> 25:39.080
I would, while it was smiling in my face,

25:39.160 --> 25:42.790
have plucked my nipple from his
boneless gums, and dashed the brains out,

25:42.870 --> 25:45.750
had I so sworn as you have done to this.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.210
If we should fail?

25:48.290 --> 25:49.670
We fail.

25:50.500 --> 25:54.090
But screw your courage
to the sticking-place, and we'll not fail.

25:55.180 --> 25:57.090
When Duncan is asleep,

25:57.180 --> 26:00.760
whereto the rather shall his day's
hard journey soundly invite him,

26:00.850 --> 26:05.060
his two chamberlains will I
with wine and wassail so convince

26:05.140 --> 26:08.900
that memory, the warder of the brain,
shall be a fume,

26:08.980 --> 26:11.730
and the receipt of reason a limbeck only.

26:11.820 --> 26:16.070
When in swinish sleep, their
drenched natures lie as in a death.

26:17.240 --> 26:20.950
What cannot you and I perform
upon the unguarded Duncan?

26:21.620 --> 26:23.580
What not put upon his spongy officers,

26:23.660 --> 26:26.460
who shall bear the guilt
of our great quell?

26:29.840 --> 26:31.380
Bring forth men-children only.

26:32.500 --> 26:36.380
For thy undaunted mettle
should have composed nothing but males.

26:39.510 --> 26:41.970
Will it not be received,
when we have marked with blood

26:42.060 --> 26:45.020
those sleepy two of his own chamber
and used their very daggers,

26:45.100 --> 26:46.350
that they have done't?

26:46.440 --> 26:47.770
Who dares receive it other,

26:47.850 --> 26:51.360
as we shall make our griefs
and clamor roar upon his death?

26:53.440 --> 26:54.860
I am settled…

26:56.070 --> 26:58.660
and bend up each corporal agent
to this terrible feat.

26:58.740 --> 27:01.580
Away, and mock the time with fairest show.

27:01.660 --> 27:04.330
False face must hide
what the false heart doth know.

27:27.350 --> 27:29.940
The moon is down.
I've not heard the clock.

27:30.020 --> 27:31.940
She goes down at 12.

27:32.020 --> 27:33.650
I take it, 'tis later, sir.

27:35.190 --> 27:37.780
Here. Take my sword.

27:42.490 --> 27:44.160
There's husbandry in heaven.

27:44.740 --> 27:46.200
Their candles are all out.

27:47.200 --> 27:51.040
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
and yet I would not sleep.

27:52.790 --> 27:55.130
Merciful powers,
restrain in me the cursed thoughts

27:55.210 --> 27:57.050
that nature gives way to in repose.

28:01.470 --> 28:03.430
-Give me my sword. Who's there?
-A friend.

28:05.220 --> 28:08.060
What, sir, not yet at rest?
The king's abed.

28:08.930 --> 28:10.770
He hath been in unusual pleasure,

28:10.850 --> 28:13.940
and sent forth great largess
to your offices.

28:14.860 --> 28:17.610
Being unprepared,
our will became the servant to defect,

28:17.690 --> 28:19.360
which else should free have wrought.

28:19.440 --> 28:20.450
All's well.

28:21.030 --> 28:24.280
I dreamt last night
of the three weird sisters.

28:25.870 --> 28:27.620
To you they have showed some truth.

28:29.710 --> 28:31.420
I think not of them.

28:31.500 --> 28:34.290
Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,

28:34.380 --> 28:37.170
we would spend it in some words
upon that business,

28:37.250 --> 28:38.710
if you would grant the time.

28:39.880 --> 28:41.380
At your kindest leisure.

28:43.340 --> 28:44.680
Repose the while.

28:45.550 --> 28:47.310
Thanks, sir. The like to you.

28:50.560 --> 28:52.020
Go bid thy mistress,

28:52.100 --> 28:54.940
when my drink is ready,
she strike upon the bell.

29:11.410 --> 29:14.170
Is this a dagger which I see before me,

29:15.710 --> 29:17.500
the handle toward my hand?

29:21.670 --> 29:22.760
Come…

29:24.550 --> 29:26.010
let me clutch thee.

29:30.470 --> 29:32.890
I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.

29:35.350 --> 29:40.030
Art thou not, fatal vision,
sensible to feeling as to sight?

29:41.400 --> 29:45.700
Or art thou a dagger of the mind,
a false creation,

29:45.780 --> 29:47.740
proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?

29:49.830 --> 29:51.450
I see thee yet…

29:53.160 --> 29:57.040
in form as palpable
as this which now I draw.

30:00.250 --> 30:02.050
Thou marshal'st me
the way that I was going.

30:02.130 --> 30:04.840
And such an instrument I was to use.

30:05.760 --> 30:08.260
Mine eyes are made
the fools o' the other senses,

30:08.350 --> 30:10.260
or else worth all the rest.

30:12.350 --> 30:13.680
I see thee still,

30:14.640 --> 30:19.230
and on thy blade and dudgeon
gouts of blood, which was not so before.

30:20.730 --> 30:22.940
There's no such thing.

30:23.030 --> 30:26.240
It is the bloody business
that informs thus to mine eyes.

30:27.240 --> 30:30.910
Thou sure and firm-set earth,
hear not my steps, which way they walk,

30:30.990 --> 30:34.370
for fear thy very stones prate
of my whereabout.

30:34.870 --> 30:37.540
I go, and it is done.

30:38.290 --> 30:39.750
The bell invites me.

30:40.630 --> 30:45.590
Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell
that summons thee to heaven…

30:48.220 --> 30:49.600
or to hell.

31:56.790 --> 31:57.790
Hark!

31:59.960 --> 32:01.170
Peace.

32:03.710 --> 32:06.050
It was the owl that shrieked,

32:06.130 --> 32:09.340
the fatal bellman,
which gives the stern'st good night.

32:11.010 --> 32:12.850
He is about it.

32:14.810 --> 32:17.890
That which hath made them drunk
hath made me bold.

32:19.100 --> 32:21.850
What hath quenched them
hath given me fire.

32:22.730 --> 32:24.440
The doors are open,

32:25.190 --> 32:29.190
and the surfeited grooms
do mock their charge with snores.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.610
Amen.

32:32.110 --> 32:33.910
I have drugged their possets,

32:33.990 --> 32:36.240
that death and nature
do contend about them,

32:36.330 --> 32:38.540
whether they live or die.

32:49.210 --> 32:50.380
Alack!

32:52.340 --> 32:54.510
I am afraid they have awaked,
and 'tis not done.

32:54.600 --> 32:57.260
The attempt and not the deed confounds us.

32:57.890 --> 32:58.970
Hark.

32:59.060 --> 33:01.770
I laid their daggers ready.
He could not miss 'em!

33:04.900 --> 33:06.270
My husband.

33:08.480 --> 33:09.900
I have done the deed.

33:10.650 --> 33:12.320
Didst thou not hear a noise?

33:12.400 --> 33:14.360
-When?
-Now.

33:14.450 --> 33:15.700
-As I descended?
-Aye.

33:15.780 --> 33:16.780
Hark.

33:20.330 --> 33:22.410
This is a sorry sight.

33:23.040 --> 33:25.670
A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.

33:27.960 --> 33:29.420
There's one did laugh in his sleep,

33:29.510 --> 33:31.550
and one cried, "Murder!"
that they did wake each other.

33:31.630 --> 33:33.550
I stood and heard them.

33:33.630 --> 33:36.600
But they did say their prayers,
and addressed them again to sleep.

33:36.680 --> 33:37.800
The grooms were lodged together.

33:37.890 --> 33:40.720
One cried, "God bless us,"

33:41.730 --> 33:42.810
and, "Amen," the other,

33:42.890 --> 33:44.690
as they had seen me
with these hangman's hands.

33:44.770 --> 33:48.020
Listening their fear, I could not say
"amen" when they did say, "God bless us."

33:48.110 --> 33:49.400
Consider it not so deeply.

33:49.480 --> 33:50.900
But wherefore could not
I pronounce "amen"?

33:50.980 --> 33:54.660
I had most need of blessing,
and "amen" stuck in my throat.

33:54.740 --> 33:56.950
These deeds must not
be thought after these ways.

33:57.030 --> 34:00.040
So, it will make us mad.

34:00.120 --> 34:02.500
Methought I heard a voice cry,
"Sleep no more.

34:04.080 --> 34:05.750
Macbeth hath murdered sleep."

34:05.830 --> 34:07.380
The innocent sleep.

34:07.460 --> 34:10.460
Sleep that knits up
the raveled sleeve of care,

34:10.550 --> 34:15.260
the death of each day's life,
sore labor's bath,

34:15.340 --> 34:19.010
balm of hurt minds,
great nature's second course,

34:19.100 --> 34:21.429
-chief nourisher in life's feast.
-What do you mean?

34:21.520 --> 34:24.020
Still it cried, "Sleep no more,"
to all the house.

34:24.100 --> 34:28.020
"Glamis hath murdered sleep,
and therefore Cawdor shall sleep no more."

34:30.980 --> 34:33.070
"Macbeth shall sleep no more."

34:33.150 --> 34:35.070
Who was it that thus cried?

34:35.150 --> 34:38.659
Why, worthy Thane,
you do unbend your noble strength,

34:38.739 --> 34:40.330
to think so brainsickly of things.

34:40.409 --> 34:43.909
Go. Get some water, and wash
this filthy witness from your hand.

34:47.040 --> 34:49.170
Why did you bring
these daggers from the place?

34:49.250 --> 34:52.800
They must lie there. Go. Carry them.
And smear the sleepy grooms with blood.

34:52.880 --> 34:55.420
I'll go no more.
I'm afraid to think what I have done.

34:55.510 --> 34:56.840
Look on't again I dare not.

34:56.920 --> 34:58.890
Infirm of purpose.

34:58.970 --> 35:00.600
Give me the daggers.

35:01.470 --> 35:03.930
The sleeping and the dead
are but as pictures.

35:04.020 --> 35:06.480
'Tis the eye of childhood
that fears a painted devil.

35:07.480 --> 35:10.770
I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal,
for it must seem their guilt.

35:11.650 --> 35:14.990
My hands are of your color,
but I shame to wear a heart so white.

35:24.240 --> 35:25.580
Whence is that knocking?

35:28.170 --> 35:30.960
How is it with me,
when every noise appalls me?

35:32.500 --> 35:36.670
What hands are here?
They pluck out mine eyes.

35:38.630 --> 35:43.010
Will all great Neptune's ocean wash
this blood clean from my hand?

35:43.100 --> 35:48.230
No, this my hand will rather
the multitudinous seas incarnadine,

35:48.310 --> 35:50.520
making the green one red.

35:55.820 --> 35:57.950
To know my deed,
'twere best not know myself.

35:59.150 --> 36:00.950
Wake Duncan with thy knocking!

36:02.490 --> 36:03.830
I would thou couldst.

36:18.420 --> 36:20.550
Here's a knocking indeed.

36:29.270 --> 36:31.730
If a man were porter of hell-gate,

36:31.810 --> 36:34.020
he should have old turning the key.

36:36.230 --> 36:37.230
Knock, knock!

36:37.320 --> 36:40.280
Who's there, in the name of Beelzebub?

36:41.030 --> 36:45.330
Here's a farmer, that hanged himself
on the expectation of plenty.

36:45.410 --> 36:48.620
Come in time. Here you'll sweat for it.

36:50.370 --> 36:51.960
Knock, knock.

36:52.040 --> 36:56.460
Here's an equivocator, that could swear
in both the scales against either scale,

36:56.550 --> 36:58.670
yet could not equivocate to heaven.

37:00.300 --> 37:01.630
Come in, equivocator.

37:02.380 --> 37:04.510
Knock, knock. Who's there?

37:05.260 --> 37:09.270
Here's an English tailor, come hither
for stealing out of a French hose.

37:09.350 --> 37:12.900
Come in, tailor.
Here you may roast your goose.

37:15.360 --> 37:17.230
Knock, knock. Never at quiet.

37:19.360 --> 37:21.990
But this place is too cold for hell.

37:22.070 --> 37:25.870
I'll devil-porter it no further. Anon!

37:27.660 --> 37:29.330
I pray you, remember the porter.

37:29.410 --> 37:32.540
Was it so late, friend, ere you went
to bed, that you do lie so late?

37:32.620 --> 37:34.710
Faith, sir, we were carousing
till the second cock.

37:34.790 --> 37:37.210
And drink, sir, is a great provoker
of three things.

37:37.290 --> 37:41.720
-What three things?
-Nose-painting, sleep and urine.

37:42.340 --> 37:44.800
Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes.

37:44.890 --> 37:48.430
It provokes the desire,
but it takes away the performance.

37:48.510 --> 37:52.060
Therefore, much drink may be said to be
an equivocator with lechery.

37:52.140 --> 37:55.230
It makes him, and it mars him.
It sets him on, and it takes him off.

37:55.310 --> 38:00.860
It persuades him, disheartens him,
makes him stand to, and not stand to.

38:04.700 --> 38:11.160
In conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep,
and, giving him the lie, leaves him.

38:11.250 --> 38:13.830
I believe drink gave thee
the lie last night.

38:19.710 --> 38:21.000
Good morrow, both.

38:25.340 --> 38:27.010
Is the king stirring, worthy Thane?

38:28.720 --> 38:29.720
Not yet.

38:30.850 --> 38:34.810
He did command me to call timely on him.
I have almost slipped the hour.

38:38.400 --> 38:39.730
Make so bold to call.

38:41.020 --> 38:43.110
Goes the king hence today?

38:43.990 --> 38:45.780
He does. He did appoint so.

38:47.110 --> 38:49.030
The night has been unruly.

38:52.410 --> 38:54.710
Where we lay,
our chimneys were blown down.

38:56.330 --> 39:00.420
And, as they say,
lamentings heard in the air.

39:00.500 --> 39:06.680
Strange screams of death and prophesying,
with accents terrible, of dire combustion

39:06.760 --> 39:10.220
and confused events new hatched
to the woeful time.

39:11.050 --> 39:12.260
And the obscure bird…

39:12.350 --> 39:14.850
-Your Majesty?
-…clamored the livelong night.

39:15.730 --> 39:20.610
Some say, the earth was feverous
and did shake.

39:22.730 --> 39:24.400
'Twas a rough night.

39:24.480 --> 39:28.280
Horror! Horror! Horror!

39:29.240 --> 39:32.030
Tongue nor heart cannot
conceive nor name thee.

39:32.120 --> 39:35.330
-What's the matter?
-Confusion now hath made his masterpiece.

39:35.410 --> 39:38.960
Most sacrilegious murder hath broke
ope the Lord's anointed temple,

39:39.040 --> 39:40.670
and stole thence the life of the building.

39:40.750 --> 39:41.880
Mean you His Majesty?

39:41.960 --> 39:44.050
Approach the chamber,
and destroy your sight with a new Gorgon.

39:44.130 --> 39:47.300
Do not bid me speak.
See, and then speak yourselves.

39:47.380 --> 39:51.180
Awake! Awake! Ring the alarum bell!

39:52.760 --> 39:54.010
Murder and treason!

39:54.600 --> 40:00.060
As from your graves rise up, and walk
like sprites, to countenance this horror!

40:03.070 --> 40:07.320
Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! Awake!

40:07.400 --> 40:10.610
Up! Up! And see the great doom's image!

40:11.910 --> 40:13.990
Malcolm! Banquo!

40:16.620 --> 40:18.960
Had I but died an hour before this chance…

40:20.500 --> 40:22.040
I had lived a blessed time.

40:24.590 --> 40:25.880
For, from this instant,

40:25.960 --> 40:28.800
there's nothing serious in mortality.
All is but toys.

40:28.880 --> 40:30.220
What's the business,

40:30.300 --> 40:32.970
that such a hideous trumpet calls
to parley the sleepers of the house?

40:33.050 --> 40:35.890
-Renown and grace is dead.
-Speak! Speak!

40:35.970 --> 40:38.390
The wine of life is drawn,

40:38.480 --> 40:41.810
and the mere lees
is left this vault to brag of.

40:41.900 --> 40:44.110
Banquo. Banquo.

40:44.690 --> 40:46.150
Our royal master's murdered.

40:46.230 --> 40:48.780
Woe, alas!

40:48.860 --> 40:51.660
-What, in our house?
-Too cruel anywhere.

40:52.530 --> 40:55.580
-What is amiss?
-You are, and do not know it.

40:56.290 --> 41:00.870
The spring, the head,
the fountain of your blood is stopped.

41:00.960 --> 41:03.080
The very source of it is stopped.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.340
Your father…

41:06.250 --> 41:07.710
is murdered.

41:11.720 --> 41:12.720
By whom?

41:12.800 --> 41:15.510
Those of his chamber,
as it seemed, had done it.

41:16.010 --> 41:19.220
Their hands and faces
were all badged with blood.

41:19.310 --> 41:22.350
Yet I do repent me of my fury,
that I did kill them.

41:24.150 --> 41:25.940
-Why?
-Wherefore did you so?

41:29.030 --> 41:31.900
Who can be wise, amazed,

41:32.990 --> 41:37.330
temperate and furious,
loyal and neutral, in an instant?

41:38.120 --> 41:39.240
No man.

41:41.000 --> 41:45.670
The expedition of my violent love
outran the pauser, reason.

41:45.750 --> 41:48.550
Here lay Duncan,

41:49.800 --> 41:52.930
his silver skin laced
with his golden blood.

41:53.630 --> 41:59.140
And his gashed stabs looked like a breach
in nature for ruin's wasteful entrance.

41:59.220 --> 42:04.100
There, the murderers,
steeped in the colors of their trade,

42:04.810 --> 42:08.820
their daggers unmannerly
breeched with gore.

42:09.320 --> 42:12.490
Who could refrain,
that had a heart to love,

42:14.200 --> 42:19.280
and in that heart courage
to make his love known?

42:21.250 --> 42:23.120
Look to the lady.

42:23.210 --> 42:26.210
And when we have our naked frailties hid,
which suffer in exposure,

42:26.290 --> 42:27.290
let us meet,

42:27.960 --> 42:30.840
and question this most bloody
piece of work, to know it further.

42:41.640 --> 42:43.480
Why do we hold our tongues,

42:43.560 --> 42:45.850
that most may claim
this argument for ours?

42:45.940 --> 42:46.980
Let's away.

42:47.650 --> 42:50.400
-Our tears are not yet brewed.
-Let's not consort with them.

42:50.480 --> 42:53.820
To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
which the false man does easy.

42:54.400 --> 42:56.570
-I'll to England.
-To Ireland, I.

42:57.530 --> 43:00.080
Our separated fortune
shall keep us both the safer.

43:00.660 --> 43:01.870
Where we are…

43:03.250 --> 43:05.000
there's daggers in men's smiles.

43:05.080 --> 43:07.000
The near in blood, the nearer bloody.

43:07.080 --> 43:09.960
This murderous shaft that's shot
hath not yet lighted.

43:10.040 --> 43:12.050
And our safest way is to avoid the aim.

43:12.130 --> 43:15.970
Therefore, to horse.
And let us not be dainty of leave-taking.

43:54.840 --> 43:56.510
Here comes the good Macduff.

44:05.180 --> 44:06.850
How goes the world, sir, now?

44:08.310 --> 44:11.020
Is't known who did this
more than bloody deed?

44:11.100 --> 44:13.190
Those that Macbeth hath slain.

44:13.270 --> 44:16.740
Alas, the day.
What good could they pretend?

44:16.820 --> 44:18.240
Well, they were suborned.

44:19.070 --> 44:20.070
Malcolm and Donalbain,

44:20.160 --> 44:22.530
the king's two sons,
are stolen away and fled.

44:22.620 --> 44:25.290
Which puts upon them
suspicion of the deed.

44:25.370 --> 44:30.420
Then 'tis most like the sovereignty
will fall upon Macbeth?

44:30.500 --> 44:34.130
He's already named,
and gone to Dunsinane to be invested.

44:34.210 --> 44:35.210
Will you to Dunsinane?

44:36.510 --> 44:38.840
No, cousin. I'll home to Fife.

44:40.050 --> 44:41.050
Well…

44:43.430 --> 44:44.430
I will thither.

44:45.260 --> 44:48.020
May you see things well done there. Adieu.

44:49.640 --> 44:52.480
Lest our old robes sit easier
than our new.

44:57.440 --> 45:00.570
He that has and a little tiny wit

45:01.110 --> 45:04.240
With a heigh-ho, the wind and the rain

45:05.080 --> 45:09.660
Must make content
With his fortunes fit

45:10.960 --> 45:15.590
For the rain it raineth every day

45:30.980 --> 45:33.690
Threescore and ten I can remember well,

45:34.900 --> 45:36.440
within the volume of which time

45:36.520 --> 45:41.860
I have seen hours dreadful
and things strange.

45:43.030 --> 45:48.790
But this sore night
hath trifled former knowings.

45:50.080 --> 45:51.250
Good father.

45:53.040 --> 45:54.920
Thou seest the heavens,

45:55.000 --> 46:00.050
as troubled with man's act,
threatens the bloody stage.

46:00.130 --> 46:01.840
By the clock, 'tis day,

46:02.970 --> 46:06.180
and yet dark night strangles
the traveling lamp.

46:07.760 --> 46:13.140
Is't night's predominance,
or the day's shame,

46:13.730 --> 46:16.360
that darkness does
the face of earth entomb,

46:16.440 --> 46:18.020
when living light should kiss it?

46:18.110 --> 46:21.320
'Tis unnatural,
even like the deed that's done.

46:24.280 --> 46:29.410
On Tuesday last, a falcon,
towering in her pride of place,

46:29.490 --> 46:32.660
was by a mousing owl hawked at and killed.

46:33.330 --> 46:38.590
And Duncan's horses,
a thing most strange and certain,

46:39.460 --> 46:41.460
beauteous and swift,

46:41.550 --> 46:45.220
the minions of their race,
turned wild in nature,

46:45.300 --> 46:49.350
broke their stalls, flung out,
contending 'gainst obedience,

46:49.430 --> 46:52.680
as they would make war with mankind.

46:58.190 --> 47:00.360
'Tis said they ate each other.

47:39.440 --> 47:40.730
Thou hast it now.

47:42.480 --> 47:45.360
King, Cawdor,

47:46.530 --> 47:47.780
Glamis…

47:49.910 --> 47:52.410
all. As the weird women promised.

47:55.200 --> 47:57.920
And, I fear,
thou play'dst most foully for it.

48:00.920 --> 48:03.750
Yet it was said
it should not stand in thy posterity,

48:03.840 --> 48:08.630
but that myself should be
the root and father of many kings.

48:09.380 --> 48:11.300
If there come truth from them--

48:12.510 --> 48:15.560
as upon thee, Macbeth,
their speeches shine--

48:18.020 --> 48:21.520
why, by the verities on thee made good,

48:21.610 --> 48:27.440
may they not be my oracles as well,
and set me up in hope?

48:30.530 --> 48:31.910
But hush. No more.

48:48.130 --> 48:50.470
Here's our chief guest.

48:51.590 --> 48:55.220
If he had been forgotten,
it had been as a gap in our great feast,

48:55.310 --> 48:57.180
and all-thing unbecoming.

48:57.270 --> 49:00.560
Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir.
And I'll request your presence.

49:01.900 --> 49:03.360
Ride you this afternoon?

49:04.110 --> 49:05.110
Aye, my good lord.

49:05.190 --> 49:07.190
We should have else desired
your good advice,

49:07.280 --> 49:10.490
which still hath been both grave
and prosperous, in this day's council.

49:10.570 --> 49:12.820
But we'll take tomorrow.

49:13.620 --> 49:14.660
Is it far you ride?

49:14.740 --> 49:18.410
As far, my lord, as will fill up the time
'twixt this and supper.

49:19.040 --> 49:20.370
Go not my horse the better,

49:20.460 --> 49:24.380
I must become a borrower of the night
for a dark hour or twain.

49:26.340 --> 49:27.460
Fail not our feast.

49:28.130 --> 49:29.380
My lord, I will not.

49:29.460 --> 49:32.550
We hear, our bloody cousins are bestowed
in England and in Ireland,

49:32.630 --> 49:34.970
not confessing their cruel parricide.

49:35.470 --> 49:36.560
But of that tomorrow,

49:36.640 --> 49:39.560
when therewithal we shall have
cause of state craving us jointly.

49:39.640 --> 49:42.440
Hie you to horse.
Adieu, till you return at night.

49:47.070 --> 49:48.280
Goes Fleance with you?

49:53.110 --> 49:54.110
Aye, my good lord.

49:54.200 --> 49:56.830
I wish your horses swift and sure of foot.

49:57.490 --> 49:59.830
And so I do commend them to your backs.

50:02.540 --> 50:03.540
Farewell.

50:09.420 --> 50:11.220
Attend those men our pleasure?

50:12.420 --> 50:14.840
They do, my lord.

50:21.430 --> 50:23.270
Was it not yesterday we spoke together?

50:24.020 --> 50:25.850
-It was.
-So please Your Highness.

50:25.940 --> 50:28.610
Well then, now have you considered
of my speeches?

50:31.150 --> 50:35.360
Know that it was Banquo in the times past

50:35.860 --> 50:38.120
which held you so under fortune,

50:38.200 --> 50:40.660
which you thought had been
our innocent self.

50:40.740 --> 50:44.210
This I made good to you in our last
conference, passed in probation with you,

50:44.290 --> 50:47.670
how you were borne in hand,
how crossed, the instruments,

50:47.750 --> 50:50.050
who wrought with them, and all things else

50:50.130 --> 50:54.380
that might to half a soul
and to a notion crazed say,

50:54.470 --> 50:55.840
"Thus did Banquo."

50:55.930 --> 50:57.590
You made it known to us.

50:57.680 --> 51:01.890
I did so, and went further,
which is now our point of second meeting.

51:03.520 --> 51:07.520
Do you find your patience so predominant
in your nature that you can let this go?

51:10.190 --> 51:12.190
Are you so…

51:12.280 --> 51:16.660
gospeled to pray for this good man
and for his issue,

51:16.740 --> 51:20.530
whose heavy hand hath bowed you
to the grave and beggared yours forever?

51:20.620 --> 51:22.740
We are men, my liege.

51:22.830 --> 51:25.330
Aye, in the catalog ye go for men.

51:25.410 --> 51:30.420
Now, if you have a station in the file,
not in the worst rank of manhood, say it.

51:30.500 --> 51:32.460
And I will put that business
in your bosoms,

51:32.550 --> 51:34.800
whose execution takes your enemy off.

51:34.880 --> 51:37.010
I am one, my liege,

51:37.090 --> 51:40.550
whom the vile blows and buffets
of the world have so incensed

51:40.640 --> 51:42.850
that I'm reckless what I do
to spite the world.

51:42.930 --> 51:44.100
And I another.

51:44.180 --> 51:47.140
So weary with disasters,
tugged with fortune,

51:47.230 --> 51:51.900
that I would set my life on any chance,
to mend it, or be rid on't.

51:53.780 --> 51:56.320
Both of you know Banquo was your enemy.

51:59.110 --> 52:00.120
True, my lord.

52:01.330 --> 52:02.780
So is he mine.

52:03.370 --> 52:04.870
And in such bloody distance,

52:04.950 --> 52:09.330
that every minute of his being
thrusts against my nearest of life!

52:09.830 --> 52:13.090
And though I could with barefaced power
sweep him from my sight

52:13.170 --> 52:15.710
and bid my will avouch it, yet I must not.

52:15.800 --> 52:19.430
And thence it is that I
to your assistance do make love,

52:19.510 --> 52:23.760
masking the business from the common eye
for sundry weighty reasons.

52:23.850 --> 52:26.640
We shall, my lord,
perform what you command us.

52:26.730 --> 52:27.810
Though our lives--

52:27.890 --> 52:29.940
Your spirits shine through you.

52:30.020 --> 52:32.860
It must be done tonight,
and something from the palace.

52:32.940 --> 52:35.400
Always thought that I require a clearness.

52:35.480 --> 52:39.490
And with him, to leave no rubs
nor botches in the work,

52:40.700 --> 52:45.200
Fleance, his son, must embrace
the fate of that dark hour.

52:47.620 --> 52:49.160
We are resolved, my lord.

52:53.210 --> 52:54.710
Resolve yourselves apart.

53:12.100 --> 53:13.610
Is Banquo gone from court?

53:13.690 --> 53:16.320
Aye, madam, but returns again tonight.

53:23.070 --> 53:24.370
How now, my lord.

53:26.450 --> 53:28.410
Why do you keep alone,

53:28.500 --> 53:31.290
of sorriest fancies
your companions making,

53:32.120 --> 53:35.750
using those thoughts which should indeed
have died with them they think on?

53:36.250 --> 53:38.550
Things without all remedy
should be without regard.

53:38.630 --> 53:40.340
What's done is done.

53:41.760 --> 53:44.850
We have scorched the snake, not killed it.

53:46.260 --> 53:47.970
She'll close and be herself,

53:48.060 --> 53:52.020
whilst our poor malice remains
in danger of her former tooth.

53:53.560 --> 53:56.060
Better be with the dead,
whom we, to gain our peace,

53:56.150 --> 54:00.820
have sent to peace, than on the torture
of the mind to lie in restless ecstasy.

54:02.740 --> 54:04.410
Duncan is in his grave.

54:04.490 --> 54:07.160
After life's fitful fever he sleeps well.

54:08.370 --> 54:11.370
Treason has done his worst.
Nor steel, nor poison,

54:11.460 --> 54:16.840
malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing…
can touch him further.

54:16.920 --> 54:22.010
Come on. Gentle my lord,
sleek o'er your rugged looks.

54:22.550 --> 54:25.590
Be bright and jovial
among your guests tonight.

54:28.260 --> 54:31.100
Full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife.

54:32.230 --> 54:36.060
Thou knowest that Banquo,
and his Fleance, lives.

54:36.150 --> 54:39.320
And in his royalty of nature reigns
that which would be feared.

54:39.400 --> 54:41.400
'Tis much he dares.

54:43.030 --> 54:44.950
And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,

54:45.030 --> 54:47.870
he hath a wisdom that guide his valor
to act in safety.

54:47.950 --> 54:50.990
There's none but he whose being I do fear.

54:51.080 --> 54:53.750
You must leave this.

54:55.670 --> 54:59.210
He chid the sisters when first they put
the name of king upon me,

54:59.290 --> 55:01.170
and bade them speak to him.

55:01.760 --> 55:07.550
Then prophet-like they hailed him
father to a line of kings.

55:07.640 --> 55:10.260
Upon my head
they placed a fruitless crown,

55:10.350 --> 55:12.100
put a barren scepter in my grip,

55:12.180 --> 55:14.690
thence to be wrenched
with an unlineal hand.

55:14.770 --> 55:16.690
No son of mine succeeding.

55:16.770 --> 55:21.360
If't be so, for Banquo's issue
have I filed my mind.

55:21.860 --> 55:23.860
For them the gracious Duncan
have I murdered.

55:23.940 --> 55:27.070
Put rancors in the vessels of my peace
only for them.

55:27.160 --> 55:30.490
And mine eternal jewel given
to the common enemy of man,

55:30.580 --> 55:32.330
to make them kings!

55:33.950 --> 55:37.250
The seeds of Banquo kings!

55:37.880 --> 55:40.290
But in them nature's copy is not eterne.

55:40.380 --> 55:41.800
There's comfort yet.

55:43.210 --> 55:46.430
They are assailable. Then be thou jocund.

55:48.430 --> 55:51.680
Ere the bat hath flown
his cloistered flight.

55:52.470 --> 55:55.060
Ere to black Hecate's summons
the shard-borne beetle

55:55.140 --> 55:58.480
with his drowsy hums
hath rung night's yawning peal,

55:58.560 --> 56:00.770
there shall be done
a deed of dreadful note.

56:02.480 --> 56:03.940
What's to be done?

56:04.530 --> 56:06.570
Be innocent of the knowledge,
dearest chuck,

56:07.700 --> 56:09.490
till thou applaud the deed.

56:11.740 --> 56:13.290
Come, seeling night,

56:14.330 --> 56:18.710
scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day.

56:19.580 --> 56:22.170
And with thy bloody and invisible hand

56:23.050 --> 56:27.300
cancel and tear to pieces
that great bond which keeps me pale.

56:28.260 --> 56:29.430
Light thickens.

56:30.390 --> 56:32.890
And the crow makes wing to the rooky wood.

56:34.310 --> 56:36.600
Good things of day
begin to droop and drowse,

56:36.680 --> 56:39.520
as night's black agents
to their prey do rouse.

56:40.770 --> 56:43.610
Thou marvel'st at my words.
But hold thee still.

56:47.030 --> 56:50.610
Things bad begun
make strong themselves by ill.

57:28.070 --> 57:29.990
Who did bid thee join with us?

57:30.950 --> 57:32.200
Macbeth.

57:33.410 --> 57:36.120
He needs not our mistrust,
since he delivers our offices

57:36.200 --> 57:38.540
and what we have to do
to the direction just.

57:39.160 --> 57:40.500
Then stand with us.

57:44.290 --> 57:47.050
A light. A light!

57:51.130 --> 57:52.510
Give us a light there, boy.

58:12.400 --> 58:13.780
It'll be rain tonight.

58:13.860 --> 58:15.490
Let it come down.

58:28.130 --> 58:29.590
Fleance!

58:42.020 --> 58:45.350
Fly, Fleance! Fly!

58:58.120 --> 59:01.080
There's but one down. The son is fled.

59:02.160 --> 59:04.540
We have lost best half of our affair.

59:04.620 --> 59:07.460
Well, let's away,
and say how much is done.

01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:38.260
How say'st thou, that Macduff denies
his person at our great bidding?

01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:40.470
-Did you send to him, sir?
-Your Majesty.

01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:44.810
You know your own degrees. Sit down.

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:48.770
At first and last the hearty welcome.

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:54.980
Anon we'll drink
a measure the table round.

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.830
-There's blood upon thy face.
-'Tis Banquo's then.

01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:12.670
'Tis better thee without than he within.

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:14.590
Is he dispatched?

01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:17.800
My lord, his throat is cut.
That I did for him.

01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:20.720
Thou art the best o' the cutthroats.

01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:23.260
Yet he's good
that did the like for Fleance.

01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:25.350
If thou didst it, thou art the nonpareil.

01:01:26.810 --> 01:01:28.140
Most royal sir…

01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:33.730
Fleance is scaped.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:39.110
Then comes my fit again.
I had else been perfect.

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:41.700
But Banquo's safe?

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:44.280
Aye, my good lord.

01:01:44.370 --> 01:01:48.410
Safe in a ditch he bides,
with twenty trenched gashes on his head.

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:50.120
The least a death to nature.

01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:53.040
There the grown serpent lies.

01:01:53.130 --> 01:01:55.880
The worm that fled hath nature
that in time will venom breed,

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.550
no teeth for the present.

01:01:58.460 --> 01:01:59.720
Get thee gone.

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.840
My royal lord, you do not give the cheer.

01:02:03.930 --> 01:02:05.390
Sweet remembrancer.

01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:09.270
Now, good digestion wait on appetite,
and health--

01:02:09.350 --> 01:02:10.390
On both.

01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:12.390
Please, Your Highness, sit.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:15.270
Here had we now
our country's honor roofed,

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:17.360
were the graced person
of our Banquo present,

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:20.780
who may I rather challenge for unkindness
than pity for mischance.

01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:23.530
His absence, sir,
lays blame upon his promise.

01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:26.780
Please't Your Highness to grace us
with your royal company.

01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:30.540
Here is a place reserved.

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:42.170
What is't that moves Your Highness?

01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:46.050
Which of you have done this?

01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:48.810
What, my good lord?

01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:50.390
Thou canst not say I did it.

01:02:54.850 --> 01:02:57.770
Never shake thy gory locks at me!

01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:01.240
Gentles, all rise.
His Highness is not well.

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:02.490
Sit, worthy friends.

01:03:02.570 --> 01:03:04.910
My lord is often thus,
and hath been from his youth.

01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:05.990
Pray you, keep seat.

01:03:06.070 --> 01:03:09.830
The fit is momentary.
Upon a thought he will again be well.

01:03:10.990 --> 01:03:12.000
Are you a man?

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:14.620
Aye, and a bold one,

01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:17.130
that dare look upon
that which might appall the devil.

01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:19.090
This is the very painting of thy fear.

01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:21.710
This is the air-drawn dagger
which, you said, led you to Duncan.

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:25.510
If I stand here, I saw him!

01:03:25.590 --> 01:03:26.930
Fie, for shame.

01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:30.060
The time has been, that,
when the brains were out,

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:32.020
the man would die, and there an end!

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:35.690
But now they rise again, with
twenty mortal murders on their crowns,

01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:37.650
and push us to our stools!

01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:40.320
This is more strange
than such a murder is!

01:03:43.030 --> 01:03:45.490
Avaunt! Quit my sight!

01:03:45.570 --> 01:03:47.200
Thy bones are marrowless!

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:49.070
Thy blood is cold!

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.580
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes.

01:03:57.330 --> 01:03:59.630
Hence, horrible shadow!

01:03:59.710 --> 01:04:01.800
Unreal mockery, hence!

01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:22.150
Why, so…

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:24.530
being gone…

01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:28.030
I am a man again.

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.160
Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends.

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:35.580
I have a strange infirmity,
which is nothing to those that know me.

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:37.710
You have displaced the mirth,

01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:40.420
broke the good meeting,
with most admired disorder.

01:04:41.590 --> 01:04:45.210
Can such things be and overcome us
like a summer's cloud,

01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:46.720
without our special wonder?

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:50.800
You make me strange
even to the disposition that I owe,

01:04:50.890 --> 01:04:52.850
when now I think
you can behold such sights,

01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:56.810
and keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,
when mine are blanched with fear.

01:04:56.890 --> 01:04:59.730
-What sights, my lord?
-I pray you, speak not.

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:02.690
He grows worse and worse.
Question enrages him.

01:05:02.770 --> 01:05:04.230
At once, good night.

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:06.780
Stand not upon the order of your going,
but go at once.

01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:09.320
Good night.
And better health attend His Majesty--

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.370
A kind good night to all.

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:18.540
It will have blood.

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:20.960
They say…

01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:24.840
blood will have blood.

01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:30.630
Stones have been known to move,
trees to speak.

01:05:32.590 --> 01:05:35.720
Augurs and understood relations
have by the magpies

01:05:35.810 --> 01:05:39.180
and crows and rooks brought forth
the secret'st man of blood.

01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:43.440
What is the night?

01:05:44.650 --> 01:05:47.280
Almost at odds with morning,
which is which.

01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:53.120
How sayest thou, that Macduff
denies his person at our great bidding?

01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:56.790
Did you send to him, sir?

01:05:58.290 --> 01:06:00.710
I hear it by the way. But I will send.

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:04.170
There's not a one of them
but in his house I keep a servant feed.

01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:09.840
I will tomorrow unto the weird sisters.
More shall they speak.

01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:14.470
I am in blood stepped in so far

01:06:14.550 --> 01:06:18.890
that, should I wade no more,
returning were as tedious as go o'er.

01:06:21.730 --> 01:06:24.560
Strange things I have in head,
that will to hand.

01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:26.020
Which must be acted…

01:06:27.690 --> 01:06:28.980
ere they be scanned.

01:06:31.650 --> 01:06:35.530
You lack the season of all natures, sleep.

01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:38.410
Come, we'll to sleep.

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:47.590
My strange and self-abuse
is the initiate fear that wants hard use.

01:06:50.010 --> 01:06:51.840
We are yet but young in deed.

01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:06.480
'Tis time.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:08.770
'Tis time.

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:41.220
By the pricking of my thumbs,

01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:45.060
something wicked this way comes.

01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:51.650
How now, you secret,
black and midnight hags.

01:07:52.650 --> 01:07:54.030
What is't you do?

01:07:54.530 --> 01:07:57.360
A deed without a name.

01:07:58.120 --> 01:07:59.410
I conjure you,

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:03.250
by that which you profess,
howe'er you come to know it, answer me.

01:08:03.330 --> 01:08:07.330
Even till destruction sicken,
answer me to what I ask you.

01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:08.420
Speak.

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:10.710
-Demand.
-We'll answer.

01:08:10.790 --> 01:08:15.340
Say if thou'dst rather hear it
from our mouths, or from our masters?

01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:18.800
Call 'em. Let me see 'em.

01:08:26.350 --> 01:08:29.100
Double, double toil and trouble.

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:32.609
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.

01:08:32.689 --> 01:08:36.529
Double, double toil and trouble.
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.

01:08:36.609 --> 01:08:39.819
Double, double toil and trouble.
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble…

01:08:46.830 --> 01:08:49.580
Finger of birth-strangled babe,

01:08:50.250 --> 01:08:53.550
ditch-delivered by a drab.

01:08:56.170 --> 01:08:58.760
Liver of blaspheming Jew,

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:02.720
gall of goat, and slips of yew.

01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:09.020
Silvered in the moon's eclipse,
nose of Turk and Tartar's lips.

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.689
Here's the blood of a bat.

01:09:11.770 --> 01:09:14.020
-Put in that.
-Put in that.

01:09:14.109 --> 01:09:16.439
Round about the cauldron go.

01:09:16.529 --> 01:09:19.200
In the poisoned entrails throw.

01:09:19.279 --> 01:09:21.490
For a charm of powerful trouble,

01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:26.790
like a hell-broth boil and bubble.

01:09:29.830 --> 01:09:32.210
Tell me, thou unknown power--

01:09:32.290 --> 01:09:36.630
He knows thy thought.
Hear his speech, but say thou naught.

01:09:36.710 --> 01:09:40.130
Macbeth. Macbeth. Macbeth.

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:42.970
Beware Macduff.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:45.890
Beware the Thane of Fife.

01:09:45.970 --> 01:09:48.390
Whate'er thou art,
for thy good caution, thanks.

01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:50.850
Thou hast harped my fear aright.
But one thing more--

01:09:50.939 --> 01:09:52.810
He will not be commanded.

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:56.980
Here's another,
more potent than the first.

01:09:57.070 --> 01:10:00.320
Macbeth. Macbeth. Macbeth.

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.200
Had I three ears, I'd hear thee.

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:05.240
Be bloody, bold and resolute.

01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:07.870
Laugh to scorn the power of man,

01:10:07.950 --> 01:10:11.960
for none of woman born shall harm Macbeth.

01:10:12.710 --> 01:10:16.130
Then live, Macduff.
What need I fear of thee?

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:20.800
Yet I will make assurance double sure,
and take a bond of fate.

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.300
Thou shalt not live.

01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:25.300
That I might tell
pale-hearted fear it lies,

01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:27.010
and sleep in spite of thunder.

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:32.600
But what is this that rises
like the issue of a king,

01:10:32.690 --> 01:10:35.900
and wears upon his baby-brow
the round and top of sovereignty?

01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:38.530
Listen, but speak not to it.

01:10:38.610 --> 01:10:42.450
Macbeth shall never vanquished be

01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:48.990
until great Birnam Wood to high
Dunsinane Hill shall come against him.

01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:50.500
That will never be.

01:10:51.250 --> 01:10:55.420
Who can impress the forest,
bid the tree unfix his earthbound root?

01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:58.630
Yet my heart throbs
to know one thing more.

01:10:58.710 --> 01:11:01.050
Tell me, if your art can tell so much.

01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:05.550
Shall Banquo's issue ever reign
in this kingdom?

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:09.260
Seek to know no more.

01:11:10.770 --> 01:11:14.060
Seek to know no more.

01:11:41.210 --> 01:11:42.710
Saw you the weird sisters?

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:45.130
-No, my lord.
-Came they not by you?

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:47.260
No, indeed, my lord.

01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:50.470
Infected be the air whereon they ride.

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:53.100
And damned all those that trust them!

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:56.480
I did hear the galloping of horse.
Who was't came by?

01:11:57.310 --> 01:11:59.480
'Tis two or three, my lord,
that bring you word.

01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:01.480
Macduff is fled to England.

01:12:02.570 --> 01:12:04.860
-Fled to England?
-Aye, my good lord.

01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:10.330
Time, thou anticipat'st my dread exploits.

01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:11.990
From this moment,

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:15.410
the firstlings of my heart
shall be the firstlings of my hand.

01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:21.000
And even now, to crown my thoughts
with acts, be it thought and done.

01:12:21.090 --> 01:12:24.210
The castle of Macduff I will surprise.
Seize upon Fife.

01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:26.930
Give to the edge of the sword
his wife, his babes,

01:12:27.010 --> 01:12:30.720
and all unfortunate souls
that trace him in his line.

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:32.390
No boasting like a fool.

01:12:32.470 --> 01:12:35.020
This deed I'll do before the purpose cool!

01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:37.230
But no more sights!

01:13:03.710 --> 01:13:06.590
Only, I say,
things have been strangely borne.

01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:11.220
The gracious Duncan was pitied of Macbeth.

01:13:12.050 --> 01:13:13.510
After he was dead.

01:13:14.010 --> 01:13:16.350
And the right-valiant Banquo
walked too late.

01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:21.810
Whom, you may say, if it please you,
Fleance killed, for Fleance fled.

01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:27.570
Men must not walk too late.
I hear Macduff lives in disgrace.

01:13:27.650 --> 01:13:29.570
Sir, can you tell
where he bestows himself?

01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:31.780
Malcolm, the son of Duncan,
from whom this…

01:13:32.530 --> 01:13:34.950
tyrant holds the due of birth,

01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:37.540
lives in the English court.

01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:40.170
Thither Macduff is gone
to pray upon his aid.

01:13:40.670 --> 01:13:45.590
And this report hath so exasperate Macbeth
that he prepares for some attempt at war.

01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:49.340
Some holy angel fly
to the court of England

01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:52.010
and unfold this message ere he come,

01:13:53.010 --> 01:13:56.640
that a swift blessing may soon return
to this our suffering country…

01:13:58.270 --> 01:14:01.310
under a hand accursed.

01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:13.780
What had he done,
to make him fly the land?

01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:16.620
-You must have patience, madam.
-He had none.

01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:18.700
His flight was madness.

01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:22.420
When our actions do not,
our fears do make us traitors.

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:26.210
You know not whether
it was his wisdom or his fear.

01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:27.340
Wisdom!

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:32.930
To leave his wife, to leave his babes,
his mansion and his titles

01:14:33.010 --> 01:14:35.970
in a place from whence himself does fly?

01:14:36.850 --> 01:14:38.100
He loves us not.

01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:41.520
He wants the natural touch.

01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:45.520
For the poor wren,
the most diminutive of birds,

01:14:45.610 --> 01:14:49.320
will fight, her young ones
in her nest, against the owl.

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:52.990
My dearest coz,
I pray you, school yourself.

01:14:53.070 --> 01:14:57.780
But for your husband,
he is noble, wise, judicious,

01:14:57.870 --> 01:15:02.870
and best knows the fits of the season.

01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:06.290
I dare not speak much further.

01:15:07.210 --> 01:15:09.210
But cruel are the times,

01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:12.470
when we're traitors
and do not know ourselves,

01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:17.430
when we hold rumor from what we fear,
yet know not what we fear,

01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:24.810
but float upon a wild and violent sea
each way and none.

01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:26.060
My pretty cousin.

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:32.950
Fathered he is, and yet he's fatherless.

01:15:35.450 --> 01:15:39.160
Sirrah, your father's dead.

01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:42.450
And what will you do now?
How will you live?

01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:45.000
My father is not dead,
for all your saying.

01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:46.460
Yes, he is dead.

01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:48.540
How wilt thou do for a father?

01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:51.380
Nay, how will you do for a husband?

01:15:52.010 --> 01:15:54.630
Why, I can buy me 20 at any market.

01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:57.970
Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.

01:15:58.050 --> 01:16:02.770
Thou speak'st with all thy wit,
and yet with wit enough for thee.

01:16:03.890 --> 01:16:05.770
Was my father a traitor, Mother?

01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:08.480
Aye, that he was.

01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:10.320
What is a traitor?

01:16:12.110 --> 01:16:16.110
Why, one that swears and lies.

01:16:16.610 --> 01:16:19.120
And be all traitors that do so?

01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:23.250
Every one that does so is a traitor,
and must be hanged.

01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:25.120
Who must hang them?

01:16:25.870 --> 01:16:27.710
Why, the honest men.

01:16:28.210 --> 01:16:32.170
Then the liars and swearers are fools,

01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:37.090
for there are liars and swearers enough
to beat the honest men and hang up them.

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.550
-My lady.
-How thou talk'st.

01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:41.720
Bless you, fair dame!

01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:46.390
I am not to you known, though
in your state of honor I am perfect.

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:49.350
I doubt some danger
does approach you nearly.

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:52.150
If you will take a homely maid's advice,

01:16:52.230 --> 01:16:53.860
be not found here.

01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:55.320
Hence, with your little ones.

01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:57.740
Whither should I fly? I have done no harm.

01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:01.160
But I remember now.

01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:07.120
I am in this earthly world,
where to do harm is often laudable,

01:17:07.210 --> 01:17:10.170
to do good sometime
accounted dangerous folly.

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:13.630
Why then, alas, do I put up
that womanly defense,

01:17:13.710 --> 01:17:15.880
to say I have done no harm?

01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:32.020
Where is your husband?

01:17:32.110 --> 01:17:36.530
I hope, in no place so unsanctified
where such as thou mayst find him.

01:17:36.610 --> 01:17:38.200
-He's a traitor.
-Thou liest!

01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:40.110
-No!
-What, you egg!

01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:43.450
No, no, no! No!

01:17:43.530 --> 01:17:47.000
No! No! No!

01:17:55.090 --> 01:17:57.590
Let us seek out some desolate place,

01:17:58.090 --> 01:18:00.470
and there weep our sad bosoms empty.

01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:03.140
Let us rather hold fast the mortal sword,

01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:06.810
and like good men bestride
our downfall birthdom.

01:18:07.310 --> 01:18:09.310
Each new morn new widows howl,

01:18:09.390 --> 01:18:13.020
new orphans cry,
new sorrows strike heaven on the face,

01:18:13.110 --> 01:18:15.230
that it resounds
as if it felt with Scotland,

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:17.400
and yelled out like syllable of dolor.

01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:20.450
What you've spoke, it may be so perchance.

01:18:20.530 --> 01:18:23.740
This tyrant, whose sole name
blisters our tongues,

01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:25.580
was once thought honest.

01:18:26.830 --> 01:18:28.620
See, who comes here?

01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:31.120
My ever-gentle cousin.

01:18:31.210 --> 01:18:32.330
Welcome hither.

01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:33.580
I know him now.

01:18:33.670 --> 01:18:36.800
Good God, betimes remove the means
that makes us strangers.

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:38.630
Sir, amen.

01:18:39.460 --> 01:18:40.880
Stands Scotland where it did?

01:18:41.470 --> 01:18:42.970
Alas, poor country.

01:18:43.930 --> 01:18:45.550
Almost afraid to know itself.

01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:48.220
It cannot be called our mother,
but our grave,

01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:54.810
where nothing, but who knows nothing,
is once seen to smile.

01:18:56.190 --> 01:19:01.820
Where sighs and groans and shrieks
that rend the air are made, not marked.

01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:05.870
Where violent sorrow seems
a modern ecstasy.

01:19:06.370 --> 01:19:07.950
What's the newest grief?

01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:10.120
That of an hour's age
doth hiss the speaker.

01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:12.120
Each minute teems a new one.

01:19:12.210 --> 01:19:13.830
How does my wife?

01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:17.420
Why, well.

01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:19.550
And all my children?

01:19:20.590 --> 01:19:21.590
Well too.

01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:25.470
The tyrant has not battered
at their peace?

01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:30.770
No. They were well at peace
when I did leave 'em.

01:19:32.890 --> 01:19:35.650
Be not a niggard of your speech.
How goes it?

01:19:35.730 --> 01:19:38.110
When I came hither
to transport the tidings,

01:19:38.190 --> 01:19:39.440
which I have heavily borne,

01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:43.150
there ran a rumor of many
worthy fellows that were out.

01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:44.530
Now is the time of help.

01:19:44.610 --> 01:19:48.370
Your eye in Scotland would create
soldiers, make our women fight,

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:50.160
to doff their dire distresses.

01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:51.620
Be it their comfort.

01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:53.870
We are coming thither.

01:19:54.410 --> 01:19:58.130
Gracious England hath lent us good Siward
and ten thousand men.

01:19:58.210 --> 01:20:01.340
A stronger and a better soldier
none that Christendom gives out.

01:20:02.590 --> 01:20:05.090
Would I could answer
this comfort with the like.

01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:10.850
But I have words that would be
howled out in the desert air,

01:20:10.930 --> 01:20:12.640
where hearing should not latch them.

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:14.270
What concern they?

01:20:14.350 --> 01:20:15.640
The general cause?

01:20:16.230 --> 01:20:18.360
Or is it a fee-grief
due to some single breast?

01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:21.320
No mind that's honest
but in it shares some woe.

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:22.900
Though the main part…

01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:25.610
pertains to you alone.

01:20:27.070 --> 01:20:31.240
If it be mine, keep it not from me.
Quickly let me have it.

01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:35.660
Let not your ears despise
my tongue forever,

01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:41.880
which shall possess them with the heaviest
sound that ever yet they heard.

01:20:44.630 --> 01:20:45.720
I guess at it.

01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:53.020
Your castle is surprised,
your wife and babes savagely slaughtered.

01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:54.430
To relate the manner…

01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:00.480
were, on the quarry of this murdered deer,
to add the death of you.

01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:03.070
Merciful heaven.

01:21:04.230 --> 01:21:06.320
What, man?

01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:08.860
Give sorrow words.

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:14.290
The grief that does not speak whispers
the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.

01:21:18.460 --> 01:21:20.080
My children too?

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:25.960
Wife, children, servants,
all that could be found.

01:21:26.050 --> 01:21:29.430
-My wife killed too?
-I have said.

01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:31.300
Be comforted.

01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:35.020
Let's make us medicines
of our great revenge,

01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:36.310
to cure this deadly grief.

01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:38.100
He has no children!

01:21:41.650 --> 01:21:43.900
All my pretty ones?

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:45.690
Did you say all?

01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:50.240
O hellkite. All?

01:21:51.570 --> 01:21:54.620
What, all my pretty chickens
and their dam in one fell swoop?

01:21:54.700 --> 01:21:57.000
-Dispute it like a man.
-I shall do so!

01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:00.580
But I must also feel it as a man.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.880
I cannot but remember such things were,
that were most precious to me.

01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:09.050
Did heaven look on,
and would not take their part?

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:12.850
Sinful Macduff.

01:22:13.930 --> 01:22:15.430
They were all struck for thee.

01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:18.230
Naught that I am,
not for their own demerits, but for mine,

01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:20.060
fell slaughter on their souls.

01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:23.940
-Heaven rest them now.
-Be this the whetstone of your sword.

01:22:24.570 --> 01:22:28.030
Let grief convert to anger.
Blunt not the heart, enrage it.

01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:31.280
I could play the woman with mine eyes
and braggart with my tongue.

01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:34.200
But, gentle heavens,
cut short all intermission.

01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:39.040
Front to front bring thou
this fiend of Scotland and myself.

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:41.670
Within my sword's length set him.

01:22:43.210 --> 01:22:44.250
If he scape…

01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:48.920
heaven forgive him too.

01:23:12.530 --> 01:23:14.110
When was it she last walked?

01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:16.950
Since His Majesty went into the field,

01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:21.870
I have seen her rise from her bed,
throw her nightgown upon her,

01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:25.460
unlock her closet, take forth paper,

01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:28.550
fold it, write upon it, read it,

01:23:28.630 --> 01:23:31.760
afterwards seal it,
and again return to bed.

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:35.930
Yet all this while in a most fast sleep.

01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:37.390
In this slumbery agitation,

01:23:37.470 --> 01:23:40.140
besides her walking
and other actual performances,

01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:42.770
what, at any time, have you heard her say?

01:23:42.850 --> 01:23:46.360
That, sir, which I will not
report after her.

01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:49.070
Neither to you nor anyone,

01:23:49.150 --> 01:23:51.820
having no witness to confirm my speech.

01:23:52.490 --> 01:23:54.950
Lo you, here she comes.

01:24:01.410 --> 01:24:05.750
This is her very guise.
And, upon my life, fast asleep.

01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:09.630
-Observe her. Stand close.
-You see, her eyes are open.

01:24:09.710 --> 01:24:12.260
Aye, but their senses are shut.

01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:13.590
How came she by that light?

01:24:13.670 --> 01:24:16.680
She has light by her continually.
'Tis her command.

01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:20.600
What is it she does now?

01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:23.390
Look, how she rubs her hands.

01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:26.480
I have known her continue in this
a quarter of an hour.

01:24:32.110 --> 01:24:33.240
Yet here's a spot.

01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:35.320
Hark. She speaks.

01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:39.160
Out, damned spot. Out, I say.

01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:43.450
One… two.

01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:48.210
Why, then, 'tis time to do it.

01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:51.750
Hell is murky.

01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:55.340
Fie, my lord, fie! A soldier, and afeard?

01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:59.890
What need we fear who knows it,
when none can call our power to account?

01:24:59.970 --> 01:25:04.060
Yet who would have thought the old man
to have had so much blood in him?

01:25:05.850 --> 01:25:08.730
The Thane of Fife had a wife.
Where is she now?

01:25:11.230 --> 01:25:12.270
What?

01:25:13.610 --> 01:25:16.570
No more o' that, my lord, no more of that.

01:25:16.650 --> 01:25:20.410
Go to, go to.
You have known what you should not.

01:25:20.490 --> 01:25:23.950
She has spoke what she should not.
I am sure of that.

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:27.500
Here's the smell of the blood still.

01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:33.300
All the perfumes of Arabia will not
sweeten this little hand.

01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:54.400
What a sigh is there.

01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:57.820
The heart is sorely charged.

01:25:59.490 --> 01:26:01.700
This disease is beyond my practice.

01:26:02.450 --> 01:26:04.580
Yet I have known those
which have walked in their sleep

01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:06.660
who have died holily in their beds.

01:26:07.540 --> 01:26:10.750
God, God forgive us all.

01:26:10.830 --> 01:26:13.250
Wash your hands, put on your nightgown.

01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:15.090
Look not so pale.

01:26:16.170 --> 01:26:20.760
I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried.
He cannot come out on's grave.

01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:23.140
Foul whisperings are abroad.

01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:27.220
Unnatural deeds do breed
unnatural troubles.

01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:32.440
Infected minds to their deaf pillows
do discharge their secrets.

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:34.900
More needs she the divine
than the physician.

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:38.400
-Will she go now to bed?
-Directly.

01:26:38.490 --> 01:26:41.860
There's knocking at the gate. Come! Come!

01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:45.910
Come, come. Give me your hand.

01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:49.830
What's done cannot be undone.

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:53.040
To bed.

01:26:54.420 --> 01:26:55.420
To bed.

01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:57.550
To bed.

01:26:59.670 --> 01:27:00.670
To bed.

01:27:11.020 --> 01:27:12.980
What wood is this before us?

01:27:13.060 --> 01:27:14.310
The wood of Birnam.

01:27:15.230 --> 01:27:17.230
The English power is near,
led on by Malcolm,

01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:19.360
his cousin Siward and the good Macduff.

01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:21.610
Revenges burn in them.

01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:23.070
What does the tyrant?

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:25.570
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.

01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:27.370
Some say he's mad.

01:27:27.450 --> 01:27:31.250
Others that lesser hate him
do call it valiant fury.

01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:35.750
But, for certain, he cannot buckle his
distempered cause within the belt of rule.

01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:39.590
Now does he feel his secret murders
sticking on his hands.

01:27:39.670 --> 01:27:43.090
Those he commands move only
in command, nothing in love.

01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:46.850
Now does he feel
his title hang loose about him,

01:27:46.930 --> 01:27:49.470
like a giant's robe upon a dwarfish thief.

01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:54.730
The devil damn thee black,
thou cream-faced loon!

01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:56.900
Where got'st thou that goose look?

01:27:57.690 --> 01:27:59.690
-There is ten thousand--
-Geese, villain?

01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:01.110
Soldiers, sir.

01:28:01.190 --> 01:28:05.450
Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,
thou lily-livered boy.

01:28:05.530 --> 01:28:07.570
What soldiers, patch?

01:28:08.490 --> 01:28:09.540
Death of thy soul.

01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:12.290
Those linen cheeks of thine
are counselors to fear.

01:28:12.370 --> 01:28:14.710
What soldiers, whey-face?

01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:16.580
The English force, so please you.

01:28:16.670 --> 01:28:17.710
Take thy face hence.

01:28:18.670 --> 01:28:19.750
Seyton!

01:28:21.210 --> 01:28:24.930
I am sick at heart, when I behold--
Seyton, I say!

01:28:25.010 --> 01:28:28.680
This push will cheer me ever,
or disseat me now.

01:28:29.260 --> 01:28:30.810
I have lived long enough.

01:28:30.890 --> 01:28:34.690
My way of life is fallen into the sere,
the yellow leaf.

01:28:34.770 --> 01:28:36.770
And that which should accompany old age,

01:28:36.850 --> 01:28:39.940
as honor, love, obedience,
troops of friends,

01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:41.690
I must not look to have.

01:28:42.190 --> 01:28:44.740
Seyton, what news more?

01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:46.860
All is confirmed, my lord,
which was reported.

01:28:46.950 --> 01:28:50.410
I'll fight till from my bones
my flesh be hacked.

01:28:50.490 --> 01:28:52.200
-Give me mine armor.
-'Tis not needed yet.

01:28:52.290 --> 01:28:54.040
I'll put it on. Send out more horses.

01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:57.000
Skirr the country round.
Hang those that talk of fear.

01:28:58.380 --> 01:28:59.460
Give me mine armor!

01:29:01.630 --> 01:29:03.010
How does your patient, doctor?

01:29:03.090 --> 01:29:04.630
Not so sick, my lord,

01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:08.590
as she is troubled with thick-coming
fancies that keep her from her rest.

01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:11.600
Cure her of that.

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:15.060
Canst thou not minister
to a mind diseased,

01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:17.730
pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,

01:29:17.810 --> 01:29:19.730
raze out the written troubles of the brain

01:29:19.810 --> 01:29:23.190
and with some sweet oblivious antidote
cleanse the stuffed bosom

01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:25.490
of that perilous stuff
which weighs upon the heart?

01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:29.030
Therein the patient
must minister to himself.

01:29:30.910 --> 01:29:34.660
Throw physic to the dogs! I'll none of it!

01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:37.580
Seyton! Send out!

01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:41.170
I will not be afraid of death and bane,

01:29:41.250 --> 01:29:44.130
till Birnam Forest come to Dunsinane!

01:29:46.090 --> 01:29:50.680
Let every soldier hew him down
a bough and bear it before him.

01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:52.600
It shall be done.

01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:56.600
We learn no other but the confident tyrant
keeps still in Dunsinane,

01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:58.600
and will endure
our setting down before it.

01:29:58.690 --> 01:30:00.020
'Tis his main hope.

01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:03.820
And none serve with him
but constrained things

01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:05.530
whose hearts are absent too.

01:30:05.610 --> 01:30:08.570
Hang out our banners on the outward walls!

01:30:08.650 --> 01:30:10.910
The cry is still, "They come!"

01:30:10.990 --> 01:30:14.280
Our castle's strength will laugh
a siege to scorn.

01:30:14.370 --> 01:30:18.620
Here let them lie till famine
and the ague eat them up!

01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:54.490
Lead our first battle.

01:30:54.990 --> 01:30:58.580
Worthy Macduff and we shall take upon's
what else remains to do.

01:30:58.660 --> 01:31:01.580
Do we but find the tyrant's power tonight,

01:31:01.670 --> 01:31:04.170
let us be beaten, if we cannot fight.

01:31:04.670 --> 01:31:07.050
Towards which advance the war!

01:31:35.070 --> 01:31:37.120
This way! This way!

01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:39.700
Were they not forced
with those that should be ours,

01:31:39.790 --> 01:31:42.750
we might have met them dareful,
beard to beard,

01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:44.710
and beat them backward home.

01:31:45.210 --> 01:31:46.710
Now near enough.

01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:52.340
Your leafy screens throw down.
And show like those you are!

01:31:52.420 --> 01:31:54.470
Make all our trumpets speak.

01:31:54.550 --> 01:31:56.220
Give them all breath,

01:31:56.300 --> 01:31:59.430
those clamorous harbingers
of blood and death!

01:32:02.730 --> 01:32:03.730
What is that noise?

01:32:06.810 --> 01:32:08.610
It is the cry of women, my good lord.

01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:13.450
I have almost forgot the taste of fears.

01:32:13.950 --> 01:32:14.950
The time has been,

01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:18.030
my senses would have cooled
to hear a night-shriek.

01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:20.950
And my fell of hair would
at a dismal treatise rouse

01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:23.620
and stir as if life were in't.

01:32:24.210 --> 01:32:25.580
Wherefore was that cry?

01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:30.250
The queen, my lord, is dead.

01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:41.560
She should have died hereafter.

01:32:46.140 --> 01:32:48.150
There would have been a time
for such a word.

01:32:49.650 --> 01:32:54.780
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,

01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:59.740
creeps in this petty pace from day to day

01:32:59.830 --> 01:33:03.410
to the last syllable of recorded time.

01:33:05.710 --> 01:33:09.540
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
the way to dusty death.

01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:16.300
Out, out, brief candle.

01:33:17.890 --> 01:33:19.760
Life is but a walking shadow…

01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:23.890
a poor player that struts and frets
his hour upon the stage

01:33:23.970 --> 01:33:25.180
and then is heard no more.

01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:28.810
It is a tale told by an idiot…

01:33:31.110 --> 01:33:34.230
full of sound and fury,
signifying nothing.

01:33:37.650 --> 01:33:40.490
Gracious my lord, I should report
that which I say I saw,

01:33:40.570 --> 01:33:42.120
but know not how to do it.

01:33:42.990 --> 01:33:44.870
Well, say, sir.

01:33:44.950 --> 01:33:47.830
I looked toward Birnam,
and anon, methought,

01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:50.960
the wood began to move.

01:33:53.670 --> 01:33:56.090
Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so.

01:33:57.380 --> 01:34:01.050
Within this three mile may you see
it coming, I say, a moving grove.

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:04.680
If thou speak'st false,

01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:09.560
upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,
till famine cling thee.

01:34:11.940 --> 01:34:15.440
"Fear not, till Birnam Wood
do come to Dunsinane."

01:34:16.780 --> 01:34:18.700
And now a wood comes toward Dunsinane.

01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:25.290
Arm, arm, and out!

01:34:27.790 --> 01:34:30.120
If this which he avouches does appear,

01:34:30.710 --> 01:34:34.630
there is no flying hence
nor tarrying here!

01:34:34.710 --> 01:34:37.090
Ring the alarum bell!

01:34:37.170 --> 01:34:39.930
Blow, wind! Come, wrack!

01:34:41.090 --> 01:34:43.930
At least we'll die
with harness on our back.

01:35:26.810 --> 01:35:27.810
What is thy name?

01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:31.310
Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.

01:35:31.390 --> 01:35:32.390
No.

01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:36.270
Though thou call'st thyself
a hotter name than any is in hell.

01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:39.940
My name's Macbeth.

01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:46.580
The devil himself could not pronounce
a title more hateful to mine ear.

01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:48.830
No, nor more fearful.

01:35:48.910 --> 01:35:51.330
Thou liest, abhorred tyrant.

01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:55.540
With my sword
I'll prove the lie thou speak'st!

01:35:58.050 --> 01:35:59.630
Thou wast born of woman.

01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:39.770
Turn, hellhound, turn!

01:37:47.610 --> 01:37:51.160
Of all men else I have avoided thee.
But get thee back.

01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:54.580
My soul is too much charged
with blood of thine already.

01:37:54.660 --> 01:37:56.040
I have no words.

01:37:57.370 --> 01:37:59.000
My voice is in my sword.

01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:02.000
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests.

01:38:02.090 --> 01:38:03.380
I bear a charmed life,

01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:05.760
which must not yield,
to one of woman born.

01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:07.420
Despair thy charm.

01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:11.350
And let the angel whom thou
still hast served tell thee,

01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:14.470
Macduff was from his mother's womb
untimely ripped.

01:38:16.890 --> 01:38:19.270
Accursed be thy tongue that tells me so.

01:38:22.110 --> 01:38:25.030
-I will not fight with thee.
-Then yield thee, coward!

01:38:25.610 --> 01:38:29.320
I will not yield, to kiss the ground
before young Malcolm's feet,

01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:31.620
and to be baited with the rabble's curse.

01:38:32.490 --> 01:38:35.700
Though Birnam Wood be come
to Dunsinane and thou opposed,

01:38:35.790 --> 01:38:38.790
being not of woman born,
yet I will try the last.

01:38:40.620 --> 01:38:41.880
Lay on, Macduff.

01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:47.130
And damned be him that first cries,
"Hold, enough!"

01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:24.270
All hail, King of Scotland.

01:40:25.150 --> 01:40:29.320
Hail, King of Scotland!

01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:33.900
Hail, King of Scotland!
Hail, King of Scotland!
