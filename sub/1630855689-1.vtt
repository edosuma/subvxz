00:10.480 --> 00:13.919
Twenty years ago,
the world fell to shit.

00:14.519 --> 00:16.600
A big ole apocalyptic dump.

00:17.079 --> 00:19.519
Some bug took out
all the world's computers.

00:19.600 --> 00:22.480
Power grids down,
the Internet gone!

00:22.839 --> 00:27.839
And not having easily accessible
porn freaked people the fuck out!

00:27.920 --> 00:30.199
So, cities put up walls
to protect themselves

00:30.280 --> 00:32.439
and threw the criminals
out into the chaos

00:32.520 --> 00:34.439
so they could fight over
what was left,

00:34.520 --> 00:38.479
which was not much,
mostly cars and guns.

00:38.840 --> 00:42.200
Now insiders stay inside
and outsiders stay outside.

00:42.280 --> 00:44.719
But there are people
who drive between,

00:45.200 --> 00:49.280
badasses, legends,
humble motherfuckers like me

00:49.359 --> 00:53.200
delivering precious cargo
from one walled city to another.

00:53.280 --> 00:57.000
It's not an easy road because
all these assholes want what I got.

00:57.479 --> 01:00.880
And that's where the cars
and the guns come in.

01:08.200 --> 01:10.280
How about some tunes?

01:13.079 --> 01:15.640
Evelyn, may I have this dance?

01:28.439 --> 01:30.040
Holy shit!

01:37.560 --> 01:41.280
Okay, I got Barry, so who's left?
Gary, Larry. Got it.

01:52.640 --> 01:55.879
Don't you do it!
Don't you even think about it!

01:57.519 --> 01:58.480
No!

02:18.280 --> 02:21.840
Where the hell is this exit?
It's like a goddamn maze in here.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.719
So, if I'm here, then the exit is...

02:28.800 --> 02:31.479
They have a Footlocker!
Son of a bitch!

03:10.960 --> 03:11.960
Hey there!

03:12.639 --> 03:13.639
ID!

03:23.319 --> 03:25.400
It's the milkman.
It must be our delivery.

03:25.759 --> 03:27.560
Yeah, they know me.
I'm here all the time.

03:27.639 --> 03:29.360
- Hey, Doug!
- Hey, John.

03:29.759 --> 03:31.960
- He's new.
- A virgin?

03:32.039 --> 03:34.240
I got a big package for you.

03:34.319 --> 03:36.360
All the way from Paso Robles.

03:36.919 --> 03:38.280
Some vultures wanted it real bad,

03:38.360 --> 03:40.280
but not bad enough.
You know what I mean?

03:40.360 --> 03:44.599
Hey, that better be unleaded 93 in
there; 91 gives Evelyn the squirts.

03:44.680 --> 03:47.039
Payment's been
placed in the trunk.

03:47.120 --> 03:50.039
And we have new deliveries
for you to... deliver.

03:50.520 --> 03:52.719
You're such a lamb. Where to?

03:52.800 --> 03:54.400
Fresh batteries
for the Gainsboro Colony

03:54.479 --> 03:56.919
and the usual shipment of medicine
to New San Francisco.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.400
New San Fran?
It's been a month already?

04:00.800 --> 04:02.479
Time makes a fool of us all.

04:03.080 --> 04:04.080
What's your name, slugger?

04:04.719 --> 04:07.080
- Abner.
- Abner? Really?

04:07.400 --> 04:09.159
I mean, it's a nice name,
but you don't meet too many--

04:09.240 --> 04:10.879
Anyway. Come here, Abner.

04:12.159 --> 04:14.879
- How about you let me slip inside...
- Outside, you stay outside!

04:14.960 --> 04:17.040
Hey, take it easy. Relax!

04:17.639 --> 04:18.680
Atta boy.

04:19.040 --> 04:21.560
All right, this has been a gas.

04:21.639 --> 04:25.879
I'll see your shiny faces in a month.
Until then, Abner, eat up!

04:31.040 --> 04:33.720
What'd the milkman
bring us this time?

04:34.680 --> 04:36.759
Tonight, we feast!

04:40.240 --> 04:43.040
See, a milkman's job
is never done.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.319
It's a big world out there,

04:45.399 --> 04:48.000
but at the end of the day
all that matters is me,

04:48.480 --> 04:50.399
Evelyn, and the road.

05:04.720 --> 05:05.839
No way!

05:06.759 --> 05:09.839
It's the Bosch Icon Premiere
windshield wipers!

05:29.360 --> 05:30.600
Get off!

05:31.839 --> 05:35.600
- Give me the package, Milkman!
- Goddamn vultures!

05:38.399 --> 05:41.879
See that? Tension spring
is keeping the blades flexible

05:41.959 --> 05:44.680
for premium wiping performance.

06:07.439 --> 06:08.639
Let's go!

06:09.879 --> 06:11.040
Come on!

06:11.759 --> 06:13.680
Let's go! Come on!

06:31.399 --> 06:32.680
It must be nice.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.959
At least I was a cute kid.

07:23.279 --> 07:26.360
Damn, look at
all these pedestrians, Ev.

07:30.439 --> 07:32.560
All right,
time to turn on the charm.

07:33.279 --> 07:36.360
- Lookin' real efficient today, Bill.
- Welcome back, John.

07:36.439 --> 07:38.160
Got a fresh box of insulin for you.

07:38.240 --> 07:41.079
Life must be good
if the diabetes are that bad.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.759
For me?
Oh, you shouldn't have.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.120
You're coming home
with me, baby.

07:49.079 --> 07:50.439
What am I taking
to San Diego for you?

07:50.519 --> 07:51.680
Stop!

07:55.279 --> 07:58.839
The COO of New San Francisco
wants to talk to you.

07:58.920 --> 07:59.959
Inside.

08:01.399 --> 08:02.920
Like inside inside?

08:03.560 --> 08:06.160
- Let him through!
- Open the gate!

08:09.800 --> 08:11.040
Holy fuck!

08:18.079 --> 08:19.800
Clear the perimeter!

08:34.799 --> 08:36.440
You can park over there.

08:40.919 --> 08:43.159
Y'all got some big-ass trucks, huh?

08:45.759 --> 08:48.279
All right.
Wait. Oh, shit!

08:48.919 --> 08:51.159
Wait!
Oh, shit! Oh boy!

08:54.320 --> 08:56.360
Make sure I leave you enough room
to get out, you know?

08:56.720 --> 08:58.480
All right, here we go. Okay.

09:01.480 --> 09:02.440
There we go.

09:04.360 --> 09:05.679
Okay.

09:07.399 --> 09:08.320
Strip.

09:11.039 --> 09:12.279
Oh, shit!

09:29.360 --> 09:30.480
All right.

09:34.360 --> 09:35.480
All right.

09:36.440 --> 09:38.480
Guess I'm not getting
that knife back am I?

09:40.879 --> 09:42.799
Lemony fresh, what's next?

09:46.519 --> 09:47.639
Hi, John.

09:48.399 --> 09:51.799
I'm Raven,
COO of New San Francisco.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.159
Let me get you a drink.

09:56.720 --> 09:59.759
So, tell me,
what's it like on the outside?

10:00.080 --> 10:02.720
- I'm sure you've got some stories.
- Stories?

10:03.679 --> 10:04.799
Of course, I do.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.840
Okay, how about this one?
Once upon a time there was a milkman.

10:07.919 --> 10:10.240
Charming, devilishly handsome,
you know the type.

10:10.320 --> 10:11.679
Well, he was an outsider.

10:12.080 --> 10:13.960
Then one day
a miracle happened.

10:14.559 --> 10:16.399
He was invited inside.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.399
For no reason other than
to have a beer with a mysterious,

10:20.840 --> 10:24.080
mildly intimidating little white
lady.

10:26.519 --> 10:27.559
Fair enough.

10:28.759 --> 10:30.919
We get a lot of milkmen
coming around here.

10:31.399 --> 10:32.720
But none have come
more than twice.

10:33.240 --> 10:37.240
You, on the other hand,
have come dozens of times.

10:37.320 --> 10:40.799
You're consistent, reliable,
you got a solid ass.

10:42.519 --> 10:45.559
- I want to hire you.
- To do what exactly?

10:46.039 --> 10:49.440
What you do best.
Pick up a package, bring it back.

10:50.879 --> 10:53.639
- It can't be that simple.
- There are a few complications.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.879
One, you can't know
what you're transporting.

10:55.960 --> 10:57.240
Okay, I have a question.

10:57.320 --> 11:00.080
- It's not organs.
- Dammit! It's never organs.

11:00.720 --> 11:02.320
So, what's
the second complication?

11:02.960 --> 11:04.759
The package is in New Chicago.

11:08.399 --> 11:11.360
Sorry, thanks for the beer.

11:12.360 --> 11:14.279
- John, sit!
- No, look, I'm sorry.

11:14.360 --> 11:16.639
New Chicago is too far
and it's too risky.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.039
Sit!

11:19.639 --> 11:20.840
Please.

11:28.320 --> 11:31.519
Now, I've gotta tell you,
I've got a lot of power.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.519
I can make peoples' desires,
their dreams,

11:35.600 --> 11:37.600
their every wish come true.

11:39.919 --> 11:41.080
So, John,

11:42.399 --> 11:43.759
what do you wish for?

11:44.639 --> 11:46.960
Okay, I wasn't ready for that.

11:51.039 --> 11:52.279
Unlimited gas.

11:53.360 --> 11:55.960
A new tee shirt,
this one's kinda smelly.

11:57.080 --> 11:58.240
Toilet paper.

11:58.759 --> 12:01.879
You have no idea what I would do
for some two-ply.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.080
I think I can do better.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.240
Three-ply?

12:07.600 --> 12:09.360
How about a tour?

12:30.360 --> 12:31.679
See anything you like?

12:32.159 --> 12:34.480
That's what I get?
A souvenir?

12:34.960 --> 12:36.679
I mean, I'll take that girl's hat.

12:36.759 --> 12:39.039
No, John, this is your prize.

12:40.200 --> 12:42.919
If you go to New Chicago
and bring this package back for me,

12:43.720 --> 12:46.440
I will make you a citizen
of New San Francisco.

12:47.840 --> 12:49.279
I get to live here?

12:50.320 --> 12:54.000
John, I remember when the colonies
closed themselves off,

12:54.919 --> 12:57.080
when they threw the murderers
and thieves and bad guys

12:57.159 --> 13:00.759
out into the world to fend for
themselves without law and order.

13:00.840 --> 13:03.399
But you,
you don't belong out there.

13:04.039 --> 13:05.279
You're not one of them.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.840
John, if you do this run, you
won't be returning with a package.

13:09.279 --> 13:10.679
You'll be coming home.

13:21.279 --> 13:24.240
Shit! They're gaining on us!
Faster!

13:34.000 --> 13:35.559
I'm on it, lil' bunny!

13:37.279 --> 13:38.519
You can't find
shit back here!

13:38.600 --> 13:40.720
If we're gonna steal shit,
we gotta stay organized.

13:54.039 --> 13:55.279
Holy shit!

14:01.960 --> 14:03.759
Suck it now, motherfucker!

14:07.440 --> 14:08.600
Gotcha!

14:09.039 --> 14:10.360
We're home free!

14:21.039 --> 14:22.879
Let's go collect 'em, boys.

14:26.039 --> 14:28.919
Make yourself at home.
I'll be back in a minute.

14:34.840 --> 14:36.080
What?

14:38.039 --> 14:39.360
This is amazing.

14:53.080 --> 14:54.759
Perfect place for an ambush.

14:56.080 --> 14:57.279
Called it!

14:58.000 --> 14:59.080
Shit!

15:04.799 --> 15:06.200
- You're home early.
- Yeah.

15:06.279 --> 15:07.840
- Good day?
- Yeah, very good.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.159
Come meet John.

15:09.559 --> 15:11.600
John, this is
my husband, Noah.

15:12.840 --> 15:16.159
Hi, I was just admiring your...
this thing.

15:18.440 --> 15:19.480
It's an honor.

15:20.080 --> 15:22.320
I've never met a milkman before.

15:26.080 --> 15:28.639
And you've never met a baby before,
have you, John?

15:28.720 --> 15:29.840
No.

15:30.279 --> 15:31.960
Her name is Dove.

15:33.720 --> 15:34.639
Hi, Dove.

15:38.840 --> 15:41.600
I think she likes you.

15:42.320 --> 15:44.720
- John's staying for dinner.
- I am?

16:07.039 --> 16:08.200
Yeah!

16:33.720 --> 16:37.799
- I almost forgot dessert.
- Oh, yeah.

16:38.120 --> 16:39.360
Jell-O!

16:39.960 --> 16:41.159
- Jell-O!

16:43.480 --> 16:47.120
John, aren't you tired
of almost dying every day?

16:48.360 --> 16:51.720
And looking in the rearview mirror
and only seeing yourself?

16:51.799 --> 16:54.039
Aren't you tired of
always being alone?

16:55.480 --> 16:57.399
So, what do you say, John?

16:57.799 --> 17:00.519
Will you drive?

17:08.519 --> 17:11.039
You have 10 days to pick up
the package and deliver it here.

17:11.119 --> 17:13.039
One second over
and the deal expires.

17:13.119 --> 17:15.519
- Can you handle that?
- I can handle that.

17:16.200 --> 17:17.640
You fixed my window!

17:27.519 --> 17:29.440
- Smooth!
- See you in 10 days, John.

17:29.960 --> 17:32.359
Until then, Jell-O, Raven!

17:35.759 --> 17:37.079
Okay...

17:38.039 --> 17:40.359
Oh, boy.
Yep, got it!

17:40.799 --> 17:43.200
Here we go!
All right. Jell-O!

17:44.079 --> 17:45.200
Bye, John!

17:46.400 --> 17:47.759
Bye!

17:50.200 --> 17:51.920
Get it back to its mother.

17:54.119 --> 17:55.960
Your payment's in your apartment.

17:56.279 --> 17:57.640
I'm done with him.

18:14.359 --> 18:15.759
Peekaboo.

18:24.559 --> 18:25.599
- Hi.

18:26.759 --> 18:29.359
Bet you kids are wondering
why we pulled you over today.

18:29.440 --> 18:32.119
I'm not sure what you think we did,
but we didn't hurt nobody.

18:32.200 --> 18:33.759
I swear we're innocent.

18:35.920 --> 18:38.359
That's some fresh
material right there.

18:38.720 --> 18:40.640
You know, when I was a boy,

18:41.799 --> 18:44.920
my father told me about a police
chief named Breton.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.359
Have you ever heard of him?

18:46.440 --> 18:48.680
- No, sir, but I--
- Then stop talking.

18:48.759 --> 18:49.720
It was rhetorical.

18:50.759 --> 18:54.400
Well, this Police Chief Breton,
he cleaned up Manhattan,

18:54.480 --> 18:58.559
which is a burrow of Old New York, in
case you don't know your geography.

18:58.880 --> 19:04.359
But Chief Breton had a theory that
little sins could attract big sins.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.279
And so, he would stamp out
those little sins

19:07.759 --> 19:10.480
like a match before it
ever caught fire.

19:10.559 --> 19:12.920
And you know what?
By jukie it worked.

19:13.559 --> 19:17.440
Crime went down because he showed
no tolerance, no mercy,

19:18.920 --> 19:21.240
not even for
petty vandalism,

19:21.960 --> 19:23.400
defecating in the park.

19:23.960 --> 19:26.400
Gosh, not even looting.

19:27.119 --> 19:30.039
He saved New York,
and I'm saving this country.

19:30.599 --> 19:33.480
Now then, you two
have a choice.

19:34.519 --> 19:35.720
You and your lover...

19:35.799 --> 19:38.000
Sister, we have
the same mom and dad.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.680
I know what a sister is.

19:41.440 --> 19:42.519
As I was saying,

19:43.359 --> 19:46.480
you and your sister have a choice.

19:47.599 --> 19:48.799
You can resist,

19:49.119 --> 19:52.359
in which case, I'll have to napalm
the both of you.

19:53.119 --> 19:56.960
Or one of you can
make the tough choice.

19:58.640 --> 19:59.920
Take your own life.

20:01.359 --> 20:05.319
Consider it your punishment
for crimes committed against the law.

20:26.640 --> 20:28.319
Eat my ass, motherfucker!

20:39.680 --> 20:40.839
Look at all those brains.

20:41.319 --> 20:43.079
Who knew? Officer?

20:45.599 --> 20:46.720
Let's see...

20:47.480 --> 20:48.720
There you go.

20:49.400 --> 20:52.640
That's why you're quiet.
You're from Orange County.

20:53.839 --> 20:57.440
I've heard the barbaric things
those insiders will do to their own

20:57.839 --> 20:59.039
to keep them in line.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.920
But you, you won't need words

21:02.000 --> 21:05.400
to let others know you crossed paths
with Agent Stone.

21:05.720 --> 21:06.920
Let's go, boys.

21:22.359 --> 21:26.720
Just in case, you decide to take
the path of your brother.

21:28.519 --> 21:30.480
You have a nice day
now, ma'am.

21:59.319 --> 22:00.960
- Oh, shit!

22:02.680 --> 22:03.880
Tommy!

22:05.119 --> 22:06.720
- Tommy!
- What's the rush?

22:07.559 --> 22:09.480
Not like you're going anywhere.

22:10.279 --> 22:11.440
A little help, Tommy?

22:12.000 --> 22:13.680
Saving your ass once again.

22:14.839 --> 22:15.920
You're lucky.

22:16.240 --> 22:18.799
This baby blew the pants
off a vulture last week.

22:19.200 --> 22:22.640
Took me days to get the blood
and toenails out of the tile.

22:22.720 --> 22:26.799
So, you got a delivery for me or are
you just here to chap my ass?

22:26.880 --> 22:28.680
Neither. I need a map.

22:30.200 --> 22:31.680
- A map?
- Yeah.

22:31.759 --> 22:34.200
Well, hell,
why didn't you say so?

22:34.279 --> 22:35.440
Come on over.

22:36.359 --> 22:40.119
Where you headed? Got a lot of people
going to the great white north.

22:40.200 --> 22:42.200
Hear there's a steel rush.

22:45.920 --> 22:48.240
I got a route here
through the redwoods

22:48.759 --> 22:51.960
that would make your nipples spin
like a lady in the burley-q show.

22:52.920 --> 22:54.319
I'm not going north.

22:55.480 --> 22:56.559
I'm going east.

22:59.559 --> 23:00.480
East?

23:01.880 --> 23:04.880
- How far east are we talking?
- New Chicago.

23:07.039 --> 23:09.440
- Give me your belt, John.
- Why?

23:10.000 --> 23:12.519
You're clearly suicidal,
so give me your goddamn belt!

23:12.599 --> 23:15.039
Hey, stop that, man! It's a once
in a lifetime opportunity.

23:15.519 --> 23:17.799
You have no idea
what's out east, do you?

23:17.880 --> 23:20.960
Of course, I don't.
I've never driven past Barstow.

23:21.039 --> 23:23.680
That's why I'm here
seeing your pretty face.

23:28.519 --> 23:29.519
Okay...

23:30.039 --> 23:32.039
Okay, New Chicago.

23:40.359 --> 23:45.160
New Chicago is
2,132 miles from here.

23:46.079 --> 23:47.960
You know what that means?

23:48.720 --> 23:49.880
I shouldn't walk.

23:52.079 --> 23:57.319
It means 2,132 miles of no cover.

23:59.039 --> 24:01.960
No protection,
no safe harbor.

24:03.240 --> 24:07.000
The only shelter means dealing with
a bunch of brainwashed,

24:07.079 --> 24:08.920
burger worshipping screwballs.

24:09.720 --> 24:12.240
- I'm not that desperate.
- You might be.

24:13.119 --> 24:16.279
The roads out east
aren't like the roads here.

24:16.359 --> 24:19.039
You won't be dealing with
your run of the mill vultures.

24:19.119 --> 24:21.079
These boys are predators.

24:21.960 --> 24:25.640
Even the people trying to bring
the law back are just as dangerous.

24:26.160 --> 24:28.000
There's chaos out there, John.

24:28.599 --> 24:30.200
You'll be dealing with it alone.

24:30.759 --> 24:32.119
So, I've gotta ask...

24:32.960 --> 24:35.039
Is the risk worth the reward?

24:50.079 --> 24:52.640
You're gonna have to
go through Vegas, John.

24:53.319 --> 24:55.240
We both know
who rules Vegas.

25:56.720 --> 25:58.279
Why is the map so small?

25:59.039 --> 26:00.640
Wait, is that a dick?

26:15.119 --> 26:17.880
You know, it's really rude
not to introduce yourself

26:17.960 --> 26:19.960
before pulling a gun
on someone.

26:22.759 --> 26:24.000
This is ruder!

26:32.079 --> 26:33.880
How about you lower
that sorry excuse for a gun

26:34.279 --> 26:36.720
and I'll lower
my exceptionally cool blade.

26:36.799 --> 26:38.200
We don't want things
to escalate, do we?

26:39.759 --> 26:40.839
Okay.

26:40.920 --> 26:43.079
See? Now things
have escalated.

26:48.680 --> 26:49.640
It's you.

26:59.880 --> 27:00.960
We don't have time
for this.

27:01.039 --> 27:03.319
So, how about you tell your partner
to come out from where he's hiding--

27:03.400 --> 27:05.519
Okay, whoa!
Touched a nerve.

27:12.279 --> 27:14.240
You're hurt.
I get it.

27:14.839 --> 27:17.039
There's a way
out of this, okay?
