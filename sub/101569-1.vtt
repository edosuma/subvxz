00:51.769 --> 00:55.305
Until we meet again,
may God hold you

00:55.372 --> 00:57.441
in the palm of His hands.

01:19.764 --> 01:21.533
Demon, stop, demon!

01:25.703 --> 01:27.472
God compels you, out!

01:46.691 --> 01:49.561
The power of God compels you!

01:49.627 --> 01:51.996
The power of God compels you!

02:11.683 --> 02:16.286
Science, science would
like to explain this away

02:16.353 --> 02:17.989
as if it were a mental illness.

02:19.156 --> 02:22.527
But what, may I ask,
is mental illness?

02:23.995 --> 02:26.698
Is it simply a
medically-diagnosed

02:26.764 --> 02:28.800
psychiatric disorder?

02:28.866 --> 02:31.869
Or nothing more than
a behavior pattern

02:31.936 --> 02:36.206
that can cause extreme
anguish or suffering?

02:38.476 --> 02:43.180
Or, perhaps mental
illness is something

02:43.246 --> 02:44.515
far more sinister,

02:45.717 --> 02:47.919
such as an invasion
of the devil himself

02:47.986 --> 02:49.554
into the human experience.

02:51.321 --> 02:54.224
What we do know, is
that mental illness

02:54.291 --> 02:56.694
can be a genetic disorder,

02:57.895 --> 03:00.865
one that is passed on
through generations

03:00.932 --> 03:02.432
in families that are affected.

03:03.935 --> 03:06.871
Hospital staff were unable
to diagnose this patient.

03:08.039 --> 03:09.941
Ironically, a visiting
maintenance worker

03:10.008 --> 03:12.110
recognized signs of
demonic possession

03:12.175 --> 03:15.245
and advised doctors
to seek an exorcist.

03:16.881 --> 03:21.686
As one can imagine, this
advice was not well-received.

03:21.753 --> 03:26.758
This dark shadow is
not trick photography.

03:27.925 --> 03:31.361
This dark shadow is
not that of Photoshop.

03:31.428 --> 03:33.598
This photo has not been
altered in any way.

03:35.198 --> 03:36.266
This man is dead.

03:37.468 --> 03:38.736
He's dead because
of the evil workings

03:38.803 --> 03:40.104
of the devil himself.

03:46.176 --> 03:48.746
Let me pose this
question to you.

03:48.813 --> 03:51.281
Might the passing of
demonic possession

03:51.348 --> 03:53.383
also be a generational issue

03:53.451 --> 03:55.820
passed on through families?

03:57.320 --> 03:59.657
I've performed
hundreds of exorcisms

03:59.724 --> 04:02.894
in the last 30 years,
and in my experience,

04:02.960 --> 04:05.096
most of these
demonic possessions

04:05.163 --> 04:07.699
have been isolated incidents.

04:07.765 --> 04:11.268
I've isolated to certain
individuals who lacked faith,

04:11.334 --> 04:15.973
who lived life without
honor or integrity,

04:16.040 --> 04:19.043
leaving a gateway for
evil to enter their souls.

04:20.243 --> 04:22.412
When dealing with
the power of evil,

04:22.480 --> 04:23.413
there is no...

04:24.314 --> 04:25.883
Holy shit!

05:26.978 --> 05:29.180
Lord, I awake
and see Your light

05:29.247 --> 05:32.083
for you have kept me
through this night.

05:32.150 --> 05:34.886
And to you I lift
my hands and pray.

05:34.952 --> 05:37.722
Keep me free from sin
throughout this day.

05:38.756 --> 05:40.691
And if I die before it's done,

05:42.093 --> 05:44.529
save me through Jesus
Christ, Your son.

05:49.233 --> 05:50.101
Maddie?

05:53.137 --> 05:54.906
Maddie, are you home?

05:54.972 --> 05:59.110
Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie.

06:00.111 --> 06:01.245
Wake up, please.

06:01.311 --> 06:02.412
I just had a really bad dream.

06:02.480 --> 06:03.481
Something bad happened
to Father Peter.

06:03.548 --> 06:04.414
Please.

06:06.918 --> 06:08.186
Oh my god, my god.

06:09.053 --> 06:10.688
Tragedy struck today during

06:10.755 --> 06:13.825
a documentary film
shoot in Vatican City.

06:13.891 --> 06:15.660
The Catholic Church
was quoted saying

06:15.726 --> 06:17.662
that this was a
groundbreaking interview

06:17.728 --> 06:19.764
with one of the few
remaining exorcists

06:19.831 --> 06:22.300
in the world, Father
Peter Campbell,

06:22.365 --> 06:24.001
of Tulsa, Oklahoma.

06:24.068 --> 06:26.204
Sadly, there were no survivors.

06:26.270 --> 06:27.905
Authorities are
speculating that this

06:27.972 --> 06:30.208
may have been a
terrorist attack.

06:30.274 --> 06:32.476
However, members
of the church are

06:32.543 --> 06:35.345
- refuting that notion.
- No, no!

06:35.412 --> 06:38.883
Indeed, this incident
does beg the question,

06:38.950 --> 06:41.519
is the Catholic Church dying?

06:43.087 --> 06:48.092
Maddie, Maddie,
please!

07:42.747 --> 07:46.584
Lord, those who die still
live in Your presence.

07:46.651 --> 07:49.553
Our lives change,
but do not end.

08:53.317 --> 08:54.285
Josephine.

08:55.653 --> 08:57.456
You shouldn't be in here.

08:58.489 --> 09:00.224
I'm sorry,
it's just...

09:04.228 --> 09:05.663
Father Peter
loved you more than

09:05.730 --> 09:07.598
you can imagine, Josephine.

09:09.033 --> 09:13.104
He is with you, he will
always be with you.

09:33.824 --> 09:35.426
Are you serious?

09:35.494 --> 09:38.629
Uh yeah.

09:40.698 --> 09:45.102
I'm cooking up Father
Peter's favorite steak

09:45.169 --> 09:48.305
in remembrance of him.

09:48.372 --> 09:50.207
Doesn't it smell good?

09:52.176 --> 09:56.380
No, no, it honestly
doesn't smell good at all.

09:57.516 --> 10:00.384
It doesn't even
look edible, Maddie.

10:04.088 --> 10:07.492
You know, you need
some blood of Christ.

10:08.926 --> 10:09.794
Oh.

10:11.162 --> 10:12.830
Maddie, how can you
even be like this?

10:12.897 --> 10:14.298
I feel like I can't breathe.

10:15.766 --> 10:16.967
I mean, Father Peter's gone.

10:17.034 --> 10:18.335
We're never going
to see him again.

10:18.402 --> 10:19.403
We don't have anybody.

10:19.471 --> 10:20.838
We've nobody, we've no family.

10:20.905 --> 10:22.039
How can you say that?

10:22.973 --> 10:24.809
We have each other.

10:24.875 --> 10:27.745
We have always had each other.

10:27.812 --> 10:30.915
We're lucky, we are so blessed

10:30.981 --> 10:33.284
that we had Father
Peter in our lives

10:33.350 --> 10:34.618
for the time that we did.

10:37.321 --> 10:41.358
Now, can we
please talk about

10:41.425 --> 10:42.593
something happy, because you're

10:42.660 --> 10:45.830
a real buzzkill
right now.

10:47.898 --> 10:51.268
Remember when, oh my
gosh, you were so young.

10:52.303 --> 10:55.639
You were so cute!

10:55.706 --> 11:00.644
And you were so scared

11:02.012 --> 11:04.648
to go into Sister
Catherine's room because...

11:06.383 --> 11:08.419
Oh my gosh, do
you remember that?

11:08.487 --> 11:09.554
We thought there was something

11:09.620 --> 11:12.123
living under her bed.

11:12.189 --> 11:14.225
And then you even named it.

11:14.291 --> 11:15.826
Vincent!

11:15.893 --> 11:18.729
Vincent was real,
though, Maddie.

11:18.796 --> 11:19.663
See?

11:20.599 --> 11:22.800
Happy memories

11:22.867 --> 11:23.634
Yeah.

11:23.701 --> 11:24.569
Yeah.

11:28.339 --> 11:32.243
And by
the way, I knew that

11:32.309 --> 11:34.378
you were making
that whole thing up

11:34.445 --> 11:35.713
just so that we didn't have to

11:35.779 --> 11:39.250
- sleep in the convent.
- No way, no I didn't.

11:39.316 --> 11:42.920
Vincent was very,
very real, okay?

11:42.987 --> 11:43.854
Very real.

11:45.156 --> 11:46.625
But yeah, maybe I
didn't really wanna

11:46.690 --> 11:48.225
sleep in the convent
either, so...

11:50.060 --> 11:51.028
I was so thankful.

12:01.438 --> 12:02.507
You and me?

12:03.707 --> 12:04.909
We're gonna get through
this together, right?

12:04.975 --> 12:06.377
Hell yeah!

12:06.443 --> 12:07.211
Maddie.

12:07.278 --> 12:10.748
I'm sorry, yes.

12:12.517 --> 12:16.754
Yes, of course, we will
get through this together.

12:17.656 --> 12:18.889
I love you, sister.

12:20.424 --> 12:22.159
I love you, sister.

12:26.797 --> 12:27.666
With everything.

12:34.838 --> 12:39.843
Okay, so this looks good.

12:45.082 --> 12:47.418
It's ready.

13:04.969 --> 13:07.104
Whoever did this
to Father Peter,

13:09.306 --> 13:11.108
they need to pay big time.

13:16.347 --> 13:18.182
I'm sorry for your loss.

13:19.718 --> 13:20.918
Thank you.

13:20.985 --> 13:24.221
Father Peter was a
friend of mine, also.

13:27.626 --> 13:28.493
May I sit?

13:37.736 --> 13:39.003
You know, we used
to serve hot meals

13:39.069 --> 13:40.771
at the mission
with Father Peter.

13:43.475 --> 13:44.509
I've never seen you.

13:45.710 --> 13:48.747
It's very kind of you
to serve the community.

13:53.752 --> 13:54.753
You were a priest.

13:56.387 --> 13:57.888
That was a lifetime ago.

13:59.990 --> 14:02.460
Wait, I think I've
heard about you.

14:03.994 --> 14:05.062
You're Father Marco?

14:06.964 --> 14:08.265
Father Peter told me about you

14:08.332 --> 14:12.169
and how you abandoned
the church when...

14:13.037 --> 14:14.371
It was really hard for you.

14:16.106 --> 14:17.542
Yes, indeed it was.

14:22.346 --> 14:23.682
This place hasn't changed.

14:26.150 --> 14:28.919
Garden needs a
little tending to.

14:32.457 --> 14:33.558
You have a cell phone?

14:35.527 --> 14:37.261
Uh, yeah.

14:37.328 --> 14:38.195
Take my number.

14:38.262 --> 14:39.731
No, I don't think so, buddy.

14:42.966 --> 14:44.001
Um.

14:44.068 --> 14:45.369
You're going to need it.

14:47.204 --> 14:48.439
What, what for?

14:51.509 --> 14:52.577
I knew your mother.

14:55.245 --> 15:00.250
When Father Peter
died, I felt compelled

15:01.418 --> 15:02.520
to get in touch
with both of you.

15:04.456 --> 15:08.192
Just give me your
phone, trust me.

15:08.258 --> 15:09.561
Why should she trust you?

15:10.462 --> 15:11.895
How did you know our mother?

15:13.832 --> 15:16.133
Look, here, it's fine,
it's fine, it's fine.

15:17.401 --> 15:18.603
What are you thinking?

15:22.339 --> 15:23.273
Keep in touch.

15:25.610 --> 15:28.178
That's the stupidest
thing I've ever seen you do.

17:11.415 --> 17:13.150
You need to slow down, girl.

17:18.387 --> 17:19.691
Wanna refill?

17:19.757 --> 17:20.625
No thanks.

17:22.392 --> 17:24.294
Hey look, I'm sure you're
sick of hearing about it

17:24.361 --> 17:26.598
but I'm sorry
about Father Peter.

17:29.801 --> 17:30.668
Thank you.

17:32.069 --> 17:34.004
Shit, you can't even
go into a church no more

17:34.071 --> 17:36.406
without worrying about
being blown the fuck up.

17:38.275 --> 17:39.343
Oh, sorry.

17:41.144 --> 17:42.045
That wasn't cool.

18:01.533 --> 18:02.399
Jo!

18:02.467 --> 18:04.101
Jo, baby girl, it's all right.

18:04.167 --> 18:05.770
It's okay, you're
good, you're good.

18:05.837 --> 18:07.972
Take a deep breath.

18:11.341 --> 18:13.076
Okay, Hector, help
me, I need you to

18:13.143 --> 18:15.680
take her to the back
room, all right?

18:15.747 --> 18:17.882
She needs to lay down
for a little bit.

18:17.949 --> 18:19.784
You're gonna be all
right, baby girl.

18:28.526 --> 18:31.663
All right, everybody, go
back to what you were doin'.

18:31.729 --> 18:34.197
Next round is on
me and I'm first.

18:44.676 --> 18:46.778
Father Peter, I need
you and Father Marco.

18:46.844 --> 18:48.111
It's my wife.

18:48.178 --> 18:49.614
The devil's inside her.

18:49.681 --> 18:52.016
Tricia, don't hurt
the child, please!

18:52.082 --> 18:52.850
What do you care?

18:52.917 --> 18:54.351
She's not your blood!

18:54.418 --> 18:56.253
I'm not hurting your baby.

18:56.320 --> 18:57.722
She's just a child.

18:57.789 --> 19:00.925
No she's not, she's
just some dumb slut.

19:00.992 --> 19:02.326
Get away from me, you bitch!

19:02.392 --> 19:04.529
What, what did you say?

19:04.596 --> 19:05.964
I know what kind
of girl you are.

19:06.030 --> 19:07.599
I learned it from you.

19:07.665 --> 19:08.700
Shut up!

19:08.766 --> 19:10.835
No!

19:13.403 --> 19:15.439
I hate you, I hate you!

19:19.176 --> 19:20.645
My Father in heaven,

19:24.048 --> 19:28.786
please help me understand
the deeper meaning

19:28.853 --> 19:30.521
behind my suffering.

19:33.691 --> 19:34.559
I gotta go pee.

19:36.794 --> 19:37.662
Hi, big Daddy.

19:39.429 --> 19:40.732
Will you take over for me?

19:42.165 --> 19:43.333
Mm, yum!

19:45.536 --> 19:46.871
Oh, god damn it!

19:52.610 --> 19:53.478
Oh damn.

19:55.513 --> 19:57.314
I'm jacked up.

19:57.381 --> 19:59.449
Girlfriend, you are a mess.

20:17.334 --> 20:18.201
No!

20:19.637 --> 20:21.639
I know what kind
of girl you are.

20:25.777 --> 20:28.112
I called you some dumb slut.

20:30.414 --> 20:31.281
Slut!

20:34.418 --> 20:35.285
Slut!

21:07.819 --> 21:08.686
Fuck.

21:26.303 --> 21:31.274
♪ I will go Lord
if you lead me ♪

21:32.477 --> 21:37.181
♪ I will hold your
people in your heart. ♪

21:56.000 --> 21:59.369
"The name of the Lord
is a strong tower.

22:00.671 --> 22:04.809
"The righteous man who
runs into it is safe."

22:06.778 --> 22:09.013
They then heard voices saying

22:09.080 --> 22:10.413
whom shall I send.

22:10.481 --> 22:11.616
Who will go for us?

22:11.682 --> 22:13.117
Here I am.

22:13.184 --> 22:14.051
Send me.

22:15.453 --> 22:17.054
Everything I taught you,

22:17.121 --> 22:18.990
everything you learned
about the dark side

22:19.056 --> 22:20.925
will come into fruition.

22:22.425 --> 22:23.594
Take from my teachings.

22:26.396 --> 22:27.498
I hear you, Father.

22:36.174 --> 22:37.041
Boo!

22:38.242 --> 22:39.744
Oh, Maddie, sorry I
wasn't expecting you.

22:39.811 --> 22:41.813
Yeah, I can see that.

22:41.879 --> 22:43.614
I'm just here
picking up something

22:43.681 --> 22:45.616
from Sister Catherine.

22:47.450 --> 22:48.318
Right.

22:50.521 --> 22:53.024
Maddie, I heard him.

22:53.090 --> 22:53.958
Who?

22:54.025 --> 22:54.892
Father Peter, he spoke to me.

22:54.959 --> 22:55.860
He spoke to you?

22:55.927 --> 22:56.694
Yes.

22:56.761 --> 22:57.628
Like from the dead?

22:59.564 --> 23:00.698
I heard him.

23:00.765 --> 23:03.467
That's typical, since
he loved you more.

23:05.169 --> 23:06.737
You know that's not true.

23:06.804 --> 23:08.139
Yeah, whatever.

23:08.206 --> 23:09.140
Anyways, I gotta go.

23:09.207 --> 23:11.943
This place, I hate it here.

23:12.877 --> 23:14.145
Why would you say that?

23:15.813 --> 23:18.115
This is our home,
we grew up here.

23:18.182 --> 23:19.584
This is not my home.

23:45.977 --> 23:48.411
Bless me Father
for I have sinned.

23:49.847 --> 23:51.983
It has been eight months
since my last confession.

23:54.151 --> 23:56.621
I accuse myself of
the following sin.

23:56.687 --> 23:59.023
I have had terrible
thoughts about my sister.

24:00.992 --> 24:03.426
Father Peter has
been preparing me for

24:03.494 --> 24:06.163
what he called the evil
to enter into my life,

24:06.230 --> 24:09.600
but I never, I just never
thought it would be her.

24:12.837 --> 24:15.940
I believe that evil has
entered into her body

24:16.007 --> 24:18.276
and she's not in her right mind.

24:23.514 --> 24:24.382
Father Andrew?

24:48.973 --> 24:51.042
Help, help, help!

24:51.108 --> 24:52.743
Please, somebody help me out!

24:52.810 --> 24:56.047
Help, help, help, help!

24:59.350 --> 25:00.217
Josephine.

25:03.321 --> 25:04.322
Are you okay?

25:06.624 --> 25:07.491
Father Andrew?

25:10.194 --> 25:11.095
Where were you?

25:11.162 --> 25:13.264
I was just calling for you.

25:13.331 --> 25:15.066
I was conducting
a memorial service

25:15.132 --> 25:16.000
this afternoon.

25:17.068 --> 25:18.769
May I assist you with something?

25:30.047 --> 25:32.249
Perhaps you've fallen ill?

25:36.455 --> 25:37.321
I have to go.

26:07.018 --> 26:08.753
So, I see you've experienced

26:08.819 --> 26:11.589
an increased number
of epileptic seizures.

26:11.655 --> 26:14.058
Yeah, I've just
been having a lot more

26:14.125 --> 26:16.461
seizures lately,
and really vivid

26:16.527 --> 26:18.497
dreams about my childhood.

26:20.564 --> 26:23.034
I've even been hearing
voices, like evil voices.

26:24.001 --> 26:27.371
And I'm scared.

26:27.438 --> 26:28.939
Any
drowsiness, dizziness,

26:29.006 --> 26:30.875
fatigue, nausea, vomiting?

26:32.343 --> 26:35.146
Um, no, I just...

26:35.212 --> 26:37.848
You know what, I can up
the dose of your medication.

26:37.915 --> 26:39.283
That should help.

26:49.461 --> 26:51.128
I've missed you, Josephine.

26:59.737 --> 27:00.671
Excuse me.

27:01.839 --> 27:02.706
Are ya gonna survive?

27:04.108 --> 27:04.975
No.

27:06.177 --> 27:10.648
Oh, it's probably just
side effects from meds.

27:10.714 --> 27:12.517
It's gonna be okay, I got you.

27:15.352 --> 27:16.220
I've got you.

27:18.490 --> 27:19.690
Have you been drinking?

27:22.426 --> 27:24.463
It's happy hour
somewhere in the world.

27:24.529 --> 27:28.732
No, okay
sister, don't go there.

27:29.934 --> 27:31.902
I'm a grown woman, I can
have a shot of tequila,

27:31.969 --> 27:35.272
or two or three, if
I want to at lunch.

27:35.339 --> 27:36.674
Okay?

27:36.740 --> 27:38.609
You're the one hearing voices.

27:38.676 --> 27:40.177
Maybe you need a cocktail.

27:43.447 --> 27:45.149
I don't know what
the big deal is.

27:46.518 --> 27:48.219
You know what the big deal is.

28:12.009 --> 28:12.877
Really?

28:22.253 --> 28:23.120
Of course.

28:37.668 --> 28:39.970
Sweetie, I got you something.

28:40.037 --> 28:40.971
Thank you, Mommy.

28:42.740 --> 28:44.241
Did you get anything for me?

29:17.708 --> 29:18.909
The Lord will
command his angels

29:18.976 --> 29:20.512
to take good care of you.

29:36.994 --> 29:39.230
Mommy, Mommy!

29:39.296 --> 29:42.967
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!

29:43.033 --> 29:43.867
Mommy!

30:13.998 --> 30:17.001
As long as you know
that God is for you,

30:17.067 --> 30:19.403
it doesn't matter
who is against you.

30:20.472 --> 30:22.607
Romans 8:31.

30:22.674 --> 30:25.175
This was Father
Peter's favorite verse.

30:26.310 --> 30:28.045
We are lucky to
have such a witness

30:28.112 --> 30:31.583
to Father Peter's kindness
and virtuosity here tonight.

30:33.050 --> 30:34.785
Miss Josephine McManus.

30:36.621 --> 30:41.225
Hi, um, when my sister
and I were little,

30:41.292 --> 30:43.762
we tragically lost our parents

30:43.827 --> 30:46.030
and were left as orphans.

30:46.096 --> 30:49.567
Father Peter took us
into his loving arms

30:49.634 --> 30:52.470
and taught us the
teachings of the church.

30:53.638 --> 30:56.940
In my Father's house
are many rooms.

30:57.007 --> 31:00.010
If it were not so,
why would I say

31:00.077 --> 31:02.614
I go to prepare a place for you?

31:02.681 --> 31:05.115
John 14:2.

31:06.984 --> 31:10.588
You may not remember
me, but I remember you.

31:11.756 --> 31:14.559
Father Peter spoke to
us about this when he

31:14.626 --> 31:15.826
- spoke to us about death.
- Ian, you ready?

31:15.893 --> 31:16.960
The babysitter needs
to be home by nine.

31:17.027 --> 31:18.362
- And so I say to you...
- Let's go then.

31:18.429 --> 31:20.097
Father Peter,
you are not dead.

31:20.964 --> 31:22.433
You are just in another room.

31:24.968 --> 31:25.836
Thank you.

31:31.810 --> 31:32.677
Asshole!

31:54.298 --> 31:55.265
Excuse me.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.302
We have to go.

32:04.208 --> 32:06.310
Maddie, stop, Maddie stop!

32:06.377 --> 32:09.913
We're free, we're free!

32:09.980 --> 32:12.851
Remember when we were in
that shitty group home

32:12.916 --> 32:15.520
and we kept trying to run away?

32:15.587 --> 32:17.722
We're free!

32:19.724 --> 32:20.592
Remember?

32:24.094 --> 32:26.997
Right before Mom died,
she was drinking a lot.

32:27.064 --> 32:28.899
Maybe the bitch
was onto something.

32:30.167 --> 32:32.002
Well, you're going
down the same path.

32:34.839 --> 32:36.240
What did you say?

32:36.306 --> 32:38.041
I said, you're a drunk.

32:38.108 --> 32:40.077
Do not compare
me to that woman!

32:40.144 --> 32:41.278
What are you doing?

32:41.345 --> 32:42.279
- What are you doing?
- How dare you!

32:42.346 --> 32:44.248
- Get off of me.
- How dare you!

32:44.314 --> 32:46.383
There's a reason
why my dad wanted

32:46.450 --> 32:47.685
nothing to do with her.

32:47.752 --> 32:50.053
And a reason why your
dad is six feet under.

32:50.120 --> 32:53.357
And it had nothing
to do with alcohol.

32:58.395 --> 33:02.467
Little sister, I had no
idea you had that in you.

33:03.868 --> 33:04.968
Who started the fire?

33:06.270 --> 33:08.005
Who started the fire?

33:08.071 --> 33:08.907
Don't touch me.

33:11.275 --> 33:12.510
I don't know, I don't know.

33:13.511 --> 33:14.278
Yes you do.

33:14.344 --> 33:16.548
I don't know.

33:18.883 --> 33:20.819
Who started the fire?

33:21.985 --> 33:25.557
Jesus, you really
need to loosen up.

33:28.959 --> 33:30.427
And I gotta get back to work.

33:33.163 --> 33:34.431
The bar's calling.

33:34.499 --> 33:35.567
You wanna join me?

33:36.901 --> 33:38.068
I'll buy ya a soda.

33:39.369 --> 33:40.839
No.

33:40.905 --> 33:41.773
Fine.

33:45.209 --> 33:46.778
Are you gonna come?

33:46.845 --> 33:48.646
Because I can't
just leave you here,

33:49.581 --> 33:52.851
in an alley, by yourself.

33:52.917 --> 33:54.985
What are you, a lunatic?

33:55.052 --> 33:55.920
Sister!

33:57.622 --> 33:58.490
Sister!

34:02.560 --> 34:03.728
Let go!

34:05.229 --> 34:06.330
Don't touch me.

34:06.396 --> 34:07.765
I'll touch you all I want.

34:10.869 --> 34:11.835
When I was a child,

34:11.902 --> 34:13.270
I thought as a child,

34:13.337 --> 34:15.105
and I acted as a child.

34:15.172 --> 34:17.206
But when I became a man, it was

34:17.274 --> 34:20.911
time to put away
childish things.

35:18.570 --> 35:19.904
Harder!

35:19.971 --> 35:24.174
Go!

35:33.250 --> 35:35.720
♪ When the sun's in the west ♪

35:35.787 --> 35:38.255
♪ I remember the best ♪

35:38.322 --> 35:43.327
♪ I'm longing for
Tulsa and you ♪

35:44.227 --> 35:45.429
♪ We danced to those tunes ♪

35:45.496 --> 35:47.865
♪ From June back to June ♪

35:47.932 --> 35:51.769
♪ I'm crazy for Tulsa and you ♪

35:57.075 --> 36:01.779
Why, thank you very
much

36:03.313 --> 36:04.816
You're kinda cute.

36:06.283 --> 36:09.286
I think you should motorboat me.

36:11.522 --> 36:13.357
It's my lucky night.

36:21.833 --> 36:24.669
Why don't you
back the fuck off.

36:33.945 --> 36:35.947
You wanna come up here
and dance with me?

36:36.014 --> 36:36.881
Yes.

37:00.138 --> 37:02.907
Oh, we got ourselves
a show up in here.

37:02.974 --> 37:06.243
Guys,
you're missing it.

37:10.380 --> 37:11.616
Fun time!

37:23.895 --> 37:27.165
I know what kind
of girl you are.

37:28.432 --> 37:29.199
You get off me!

37:29.266 --> 37:30.233
Get away from me!

37:32.369 --> 37:33.137
Fucking bitch!

37:33.203 --> 37:34.404
What is wrong with you?

37:34.472 --> 37:36.206
You want crazy, I'll
give you fucking crazy.

37:36.273 --> 37:37.108
You almost killed her!

37:37.175 --> 37:38.308
What the fuck?

37:38.375 --> 37:38.976
Hector, he's
trying to hurt me!

38:00.098 --> 38:01.866
What are you looking at?

38:01.933 --> 38:04.669
You stay away from
me, stay away!

38:16.313 --> 38:17.181
Mommy!

38:30.528 --> 38:31.394
Mommy!

38:51.682 --> 38:52.550
No!

38:53.618 --> 38:55.653
It's okay, it's okay.

38:55.720 --> 38:57.088
Ssh, it's okay, Jo.

38:57.155 --> 38:59.157
Be strong and have courage.

38:59.223 --> 39:02.359
You are loved and the Lord
has special plans for you.

39:02.425 --> 39:04.996
Special, special plans for you.

39:05.062 --> 39:06.363
Sh, it's okay, we're here.

39:10.433 --> 39:12.003
We're here for you.

39:32.190 --> 39:35.059
Sister Catherine,
what are you doing here?

39:35.960 --> 39:37.195
We must pray.

39:37.261 --> 39:39.197
Madeline has fallen very ill.

39:39.263 --> 39:41.098
What, what, what
happened, where is she?

39:41.165 --> 39:44.969
Please, Josephine, we must
look to God for answers.

39:47.672 --> 39:51.909
God, our Eternal Father,
You are the salvation

39:51.976 --> 39:53.845
for those who believe in You.

39:53.911 --> 39:57.148
Hear us for your
sick servant, Madeline.

39:57.215 --> 40:00.718
Through Jesus
Christ, our Lord, amen.

40:03.187 --> 40:05.723
The police have Madeline
on a psychiatric hold.

40:05.790 --> 40:06.991
They need you down
at the station.

40:07.058 --> 40:08.159
Let's get you dressed.

40:21.639 --> 40:23.641
Why do we have to put
everything in trash bags?

40:23.708 --> 40:25.743
Because we have
to leave, fast.

40:33.150 --> 40:34.852
Take your bag?

40:34.919 --> 40:36.520
Better not separate us.

40:36.587 --> 40:37.488
Let's go.

41:05.883 --> 41:08.953
Josephine, you
look so distressed.

41:09.020 --> 41:10.788
Why are you moving so fast?

41:11.989 --> 41:14.424
Is there something I
can assist you with?

41:14.492 --> 41:16.961
Didn't Sister
Catherine tell you?

41:17.028 --> 41:18.262
Maddie's in the hospital.

41:19.196 --> 41:22.133
No, she didn't tell me.

41:22.199 --> 41:24.335
I haven't even seen her.

41:24.402 --> 41:25.636
You must go.

41:26.470 --> 41:28.673
Pray first, then go.

41:30.074 --> 41:32.410
Thank you, thank you.

41:37.682 --> 41:40.551
Father Peter, if
you can hear me,

41:40.618 --> 41:45.323
please, please guide
me with your light.

41:59.537 --> 42:02.006
I sentence you to the
of hell!

42:04.342 --> 42:07.678
To your Lord that's
never

42:07.745 --> 42:08.946
Get out!

42:09.013 --> 42:11.315
Be gone, I command
you to come out

42:11.382 --> 42:14.819
of this woman,
you demon of hell!

42:14.885 --> 42:15.753
Be gone!

42:16.921 --> 42:21.859
Come out, come out, come out!

42:22.994 --> 42:25.296
Now in the name of
Jesus Christ our Lord!

42:27.298 --> 42:28.833
This will not only

42:28.899 --> 42:30.334
confirm your faith.

42:30.401 --> 42:33.472
It will be a reminder to you
that I'm always with you.

42:33.537 --> 42:35.072
Please don't ever leave me.

42:58.596 --> 43:00.564
I'm assuming that
this news is going to be

43:00.631 --> 43:02.600
fairly upsetting to you.

43:02.666 --> 43:05.236
However, I must tell
you that even though

43:05.302 --> 43:08.005
we have not officially
diagnosed Madeline,

43:08.072 --> 43:09.373
we suspect that it's

43:09.440 --> 43:11.510
paranoid schizophrenia.

43:11.575 --> 43:15.446
Madeline is also experiencing
severe alcohol withdrawal,

43:15.514 --> 43:17.615
which is simply adding
to her agitation.

43:18.783 --> 43:20.818
- She's hurting herself.
- Wait, wait, wait!

43:20.885 --> 43:25.322
She's hurting others, so
we put her on a 48-hour hold.

43:45.643 --> 43:48.245
Hi, hi sister.

43:48.312 --> 43:50.482
With her family
history, I'm afraid that

43:50.549 --> 43:53.518
this is likely to develop
into a serious problem.

43:53.584 --> 43:55.653
Please, please help me.

43:56.921 --> 43:58.490
Please.

43:58.557 --> 44:01.225
- Take this off me!
- I'm here, I'm here.

44:01.292 --> 44:03.294
It hurts so bad.

44:03.360 --> 44:05.464
Make them take them off.

44:08.065 --> 44:11.268
Could you bring me,
baby, my tequila.

44:11.335 --> 44:13.104
'Cause it'll help me.

44:21.011 --> 44:21.879
Sister, sister?

44:25.282 --> 44:27.284
Everybody loves Jo Jo.

44:28.553 --> 44:30.354
Everybody loves Jo Jo.

44:30.421 --> 44:31.922
Jo Jo girl.

44:31.989 --> 44:33.424
She's afraid.

44:33.492 --> 44:35.926
Ah, you're ugly and stupid!

44:40.499 --> 44:43.334
Only stupid people
believe in God!

44:49.940 --> 44:51.442
Who are you?

44:51.510 --> 44:53.478
Don't be silly,
it's your mama.

44:54.712 --> 44:56.747
Come give your mama
a hug, baby girl.

44:58.349 --> 45:00.519
Don't get too close to her.

45:00.585 --> 45:02.753
She's just some dumb slut!

45:05.990 --> 45:07.191
Somebody help!

45:07.258 --> 45:09.293
Please let me out,
please let me out!

45:09.360 --> 45:12.263
Somebody please,
please let me out!

45:13.330 --> 45:14.499
Please let me out!

45:14.566 --> 45:17.835
Somebody please help me, please!

45:19.970 --> 45:21.338
Don't leave me!

45:21.405 --> 45:23.874
Please, please
let me out, please!

45:23.941 --> 45:25.176
Please, please!

45:35.554 --> 45:37.556
Wow, you're so pretty.

45:40.424 --> 45:41.825
You're an angel from heaven.

45:43.761 --> 45:46.030
I'm so sorry, I didn't
realize you were in the room.

45:46.096 --> 45:48.533
I accidentally locked you in.

45:50.635 --> 45:52.403
Can I get you a
water or something?

45:54.673 --> 45:55.773
No, I'm good thanks.

45:58.610 --> 46:00.512
I understand what
you're going through.

46:01.546 --> 46:02.713
My mother was very ill.

46:02.780 --> 46:03.814
She was in and out
of these places

46:03.881 --> 46:05.049
her entire life.

46:06.750 --> 46:07.619
Really?

46:10.221 --> 46:13.791
It's heartbreaking.

46:16.060 --> 46:18.362
I'm so sorry that you're
going through this.

46:22.866 --> 46:23.968
You were lucky though.

46:25.369 --> 46:27.404
You grew up around people
that cared about you.

46:28.739 --> 46:30.341
You had a family in your sister.

46:32.409 --> 46:34.278
I was left alone
in a group home.

46:37.081 --> 46:38.349
Me too.

46:38.415 --> 46:42.086
Me and Maddie, we
grew up in group homes

46:42.152 --> 46:43.921
and foster homes ever
since I was seven

46:43.988 --> 46:45.256
and she was 13.

46:46.491 --> 46:50.060
We had the same mom,
but different dads.

46:53.330 --> 46:55.533
I knew I saw
compassion in your eyes.

46:57.569 --> 46:59.571
Only someone who's
experienced childhood trauma

46:59.638 --> 47:02.072
can truly understand the
importance of family.

47:04.743 --> 47:08.647
If it's any consolation,
I will keep an extra eye

47:08.713 --> 47:12.416
on your sister, just to
make sure she's doing okay

47:12.484 --> 47:17.388
and that she has
everything she needs.

47:17.455 --> 47:19.323
I would really
appreciate that.

47:21.660 --> 47:22.793
I'm Daniel.

47:22.860 --> 47:27.532
- I'm J-
- Josephine Sabrina McManus.

47:29.066 --> 47:29.933
I know.

47:43.782 --> 47:44.683
I love you.

48:37.134 --> 48:41.305
You are so stupid!

48:42.841 --> 48:47.746
You slut!

49:25.550 --> 49:26.984
Can I help you?

49:27.050 --> 49:29.286
Thank you, that's nice of you.

49:29.353 --> 49:30.755
You're welcome.

49:38.328 --> 49:40.632
1743 Cypress Tree Lane.

51:19.964 --> 51:22.132
Lady, lady, wake up!

51:22.199 --> 51:23.735
Wake up!

51:23.801 --> 51:24.836
You okay, lady?

51:25.970 --> 51:27.437
Do you need a hospital?

51:29.239 --> 51:32.477
You wanna go to the
address or the hospital?

51:46.356 --> 51:49.027
The spirit of God, in
the name of the Father,

51:49.092 --> 51:51.863
Son and Holy Spirit.

51:56.034 --> 52:00.471
Most holy trinity,
angels, archangels,

52:02.272 --> 52:04.374
use me, use me!

52:05.543 --> 52:06.443
Come, Josephine.

52:11.114 --> 52:12.817
The pureness of
this child draws out

52:12.884 --> 52:15.753
the evil within,
it draws you out.

52:15.820 --> 52:19.289
You are a child, pure as she is.

52:19.356 --> 52:21.158
Burn in hell.

52:21.224 --> 52:23.260
And take that poker with you.

53:17.615 --> 53:19.449
Oh, it doesn't bite.

53:21.451 --> 53:25.355
Um, I'm looking
for Marco Baez?

53:25.422 --> 53:28.526
I'm sorry, I think I'm
in the wrong place.

53:28.593 --> 53:31.529
Marco Baez, he lives
next door, sweetheart.

53:32.864 --> 53:36.601
Wow, you're so pretty.

53:36.668 --> 53:39.504
Like an angel from heaven.

53:43.508 --> 53:44.374
Marco!

53:45.910 --> 53:47.244
You made it.

53:47.310 --> 53:49.881
There he is.

53:52.583 --> 53:55.153
Everyone that does
evil hates the light.

53:57.055 --> 54:00.124
They won't go into it, for fear

54:00.190 --> 54:02.560
that their deeds
will be exposed.

54:16.206 --> 54:18.009
I feel like I've
been here before.

54:19.409 --> 54:20.277
Where?

54:24.882 --> 54:28.586
The pond, the dirt path.

54:31.288 --> 54:32.156
I don't know.

54:33.658 --> 54:36.393
Father Peter may have
brought you here once or twice.

54:40.198 --> 54:41.065
He did.

54:44.135 --> 54:45.069
I remember.

54:48.305 --> 54:53.310
I remember this dark, dark room

54:54.411 --> 54:58.182
at the bottom of
these concrete stairs.

55:05.690 --> 55:08.893
There was glass
and blood all over.

55:09.961 --> 55:10.962
Yes, that's right.

55:13.030 --> 55:14.932
Maddie needs purification.

55:17.235 --> 55:18.836
Father Peter has been
preparing me for this

55:18.903 --> 55:19.771
my whole life.

55:22.073 --> 55:23.674
That is why he sent you to me.

55:25.576 --> 55:28.679
Performing an
exorcism properly,

55:30.748 --> 55:33.885
not only requires
that you be a priest,

55:33.951 --> 55:35.887
it also requires that you accept

55:35.953 --> 55:37.622
the darkness inside you.

55:38.790 --> 55:41.659
And that which is
in your sister.

55:45.897 --> 55:47.364
I don't believe you're ready.

55:49.967 --> 55:50.835
I don't get it.

55:52.703 --> 55:54.038
This isn't about me.

55:57.909 --> 56:02.013
Please, please, just
help me do for my sister

56:02.079 --> 56:03.815
what you couldn't
do for my mother.

56:06.617 --> 56:09.386
I was there the night
your mother killed herself.

56:10.288 --> 56:11.889
I know.

56:11.956 --> 56:14.492
Your mother died
because she was sick.

56:16.627 --> 56:18.095
I'm not sure there
was anything that

56:18.162 --> 56:21.032
Peter and I could have
done to change that.

56:24.769 --> 56:25.770
It was her fate.

56:27.471 --> 56:32.476
Look, after Peter's
passing, I just came by

56:33.978 --> 56:36.747
to see if you and
your sister were okay.

56:36.814 --> 56:37.815
That's it.

56:37.882 --> 56:38.749
That's not it.

56:40.184 --> 56:43.420
You came because you saw a
demon enter Maddie's soul

56:43.487 --> 56:45.056
the night my mom died.

56:45.122 --> 56:46.190
I know you saw it.

56:47.625 --> 56:49.560
I know you did
because I did too.

56:54.699 --> 56:56.100
I remember you, Marco.

57:34.005 --> 57:35.339
The time has come.

57:43.114 --> 57:44.782
Peter warned us of this day.

57:47.051 --> 57:49.120
And I never thought
I'd live to see it.

57:51.856 --> 57:54.358
I'm an old man, you
can't do this to me.

57:55.425 --> 57:56.761
My heart won't take it.

57:58.029 --> 58:00.765
Please, please help me.

58:03.167 --> 58:04.602
You must be a man.

58:07.071 --> 58:10.574
Only a man can
enter the seminary.

58:10.641 --> 58:14.845
You must become a
deacon, and only then

58:14.912 --> 58:16.147
become a priest.

58:17.748 --> 58:20.184
The Catholic Church
has protocols.

58:22.553 --> 58:27.558
All these years, I've been
told that Jo was a boy.

58:28.426 --> 58:29.360
You know this can't happen.

58:39.270 --> 58:41.038
Gently, gently, gently.

58:45.710 --> 58:47.645
All right, all right.

59:10.868 --> 59:11.736
Father!

59:14.038 --> 59:16.807
I abandon myself
into Your hands.

59:18.676 --> 59:21.312
Do with me whatever You will.

59:21.379 --> 59:24.115
And whatever You
do, I thank You.

59:31.856 --> 59:36.861
God has spoken.

59:39.363 --> 59:41.432
Lord, I awaken to your light,

59:41.500 --> 59:43.300
for you have kept me
through the night.

59:43.367 --> 59:47.204
And to you I lift
my hands and pray,

59:47.271 --> 59:49.874
keep me from sin
throughout this day.

59:49.940 --> 59:52.043
And if I die before it's done,

59:52.109 --> 59:55.146
save me through Jesus
Christ, Your son.

59:58.416 --> 01:00:03.220
We are here to celebrate
the ordination of one woman

01:00:03.287 --> 01:00:06.791
into the sacred priesthood
of Jesus Christ.

01:00:06.857 --> 01:00:10.529
Josephine Sabrina
McManus, thanks be to God.

01:00:20.472 --> 01:00:22.873
Please don't ever leave me.

01:00:27.111 --> 01:00:30.381
Do you
promise to respect and obey

01:00:30.448 --> 01:00:32.183
me and my successors?

01:00:33.184 --> 01:00:34.185
I do.

01:00:42.193 --> 01:00:43.961
Sweetie, I got you something.

01:00:44.028 --> 01:00:45.362
Thanks, Mommy!

01:00:48.799 --> 01:00:51.001
And may the
good work that God has begun

01:00:51.068 --> 01:00:53.771
in you be brought
to fulfillment.

01:00:58.909 --> 01:01:02.079
Here, you hold this
cross and we'll pray.

01:01:02.146 --> 01:01:04.782
Lord, I awake and
see Your light,

01:01:04.849 --> 01:01:07.184
for You have kept me
through this night.

01:01:07.251 --> 01:01:10.221
And to You I lift
my hands and pray.

01:01:10.287 --> 01:01:13.724
Keep me from sin
throughout this day.

01:01:13.791 --> 01:01:16.461
And if I die before it's done,

01:01:16.528 --> 01:01:20.331
save me through Jesus
Christ, Your son.

01:01:20.397 --> 01:01:24.435
Blessed be God,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

01:01:26.036 --> 01:01:29.608
Hallelujah, Christ is risen.

01:01:29.673 --> 01:01:32.676
Bless the Lord who
forgives all our sins.

01:01:39.416 --> 01:01:40.351
Hallelujah.

01:01:54.633 --> 01:01:55.600
Thank you.

01:02:42.547 --> 01:02:47.318
Now first off, make sure
she gets plenty of rest.

01:02:47.384 --> 01:02:50.254
And if she starts
complaining about visions

01:02:50.321 --> 01:02:54.291
or delusions, you give her
two of those yellow pills.

01:02:54.358 --> 01:02:57.861
Now I'll be in touch in,
I'd say, a week or so,

01:02:57.928 --> 01:02:59.363
and we can get
together and we can

01:02:59.430 --> 01:03:01.499
talk about long-term care

01:03:01.566 --> 01:03:04.603
in conjunction with her
alcohol rehabilitation.

01:03:06.103 --> 01:03:06.870
Okay, thank you.

01:03:33.598 --> 01:03:34.466
Where are we going?

01:03:34.532 --> 01:03:36.033
This isn't how we get home.

01:03:48.078 --> 01:03:49.648
We're not going home.

01:03:49.714 --> 01:03:51.382
We're never going there again.

01:04:17.174 --> 01:04:20.311
Oh my God, please
reach down and surround

01:04:20.377 --> 01:04:24.616
Madeline with supernatural
peace and strength.

01:04:24.683 --> 01:04:27.985
Protect her from Satan's
lies and discouragement,

01:04:28.052 --> 01:04:31.556
and let her miraculous
healing begin, amen.

01:04:36.293 --> 01:04:37.161
Amen.

01:05:29.079 --> 01:05:31.415
Oh, please help my sister.

01:05:36.286 --> 01:05:40.257
Why are you letting
them do this to me?

01:05:57.107 --> 01:05:59.376
Shut the fuck up, you old man!

01:05:59.443 --> 01:06:02.279
You fucked my
sister, you pervert!

01:06:12.457 --> 01:06:13.792
You may begin, Josephine.

01:06:17.595 --> 01:06:20.964
Sister, why
are you letting them

01:06:21.031 --> 01:06:22.199
do this to me?

01:06:34.779 --> 01:06:35.880
Let us pray.

01:06:37.314 --> 01:06:41.853
Almighty and everlasting
God, our Father in heaven,

01:06:44.054 --> 01:06:45.289
- hallowed be Thy name.
- Stop.

01:06:52.464 --> 01:06:54.264
I'm gonna die.

01:06:54.331 --> 01:06:56.366
I'm gonna die.

01:06:56.433 --> 01:06:58.770
- Lord, let us pray.
- I'm gonna die.

01:06:59.970 --> 01:07:03.307
Oh Lord. Father
who art in heaven,

01:07:03.373 --> 01:07:04.509
hallowed be Thy name.

01:07:06.310 --> 01:07:09.980
Sister, please, let
me out of here, please.

01:07:17.689 --> 01:07:20.525
We're family,
please, please stop.

01:07:37.407 --> 01:07:40.210
Today, Lord, I do not
come to You for myself.

01:07:42.112 --> 01:07:45.683
Today, Lord, I come
to You for my sister.

01:07:46.985 --> 01:07:48.720
Lord, please bless my sister.

01:07:53.591 --> 01:07:55.225
Let her be, I'll fuck you up.

01:07:55.292 --> 01:07:56.961
We fucked you.

01:07:57.027 --> 01:07:58.463
Jo, don't listen to her.

01:07:58.530 --> 01:08:00.832
It's not your sister talking.

01:08:00.899 --> 01:08:02.399
It's not your sister!

01:08:02.467 --> 01:08:05.470
Please, please help us.

01:08:05.537 --> 01:08:07.572
You are a person of faith.

01:08:07.639 --> 01:08:09.574
Focus on the power of God.

01:08:10.775 --> 01:08:14.077
Today, Lord, I do not
come to You for myself.

01:08:15.847 --> 01:08:18.950
Today, Lord, I come
to You for my sister.

01:08:22.654 --> 01:08:25.087
Oh please God, she is
the most important person

01:08:25.154 --> 01:08:27.157
to me in my life.

01:08:27.224 --> 01:08:29.158
Please don't take
her away from me!

01:08:30.495 --> 01:08:33.330
Please, please,
Father Marco help.

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:38.469
You can do this.

01:08:38.536 --> 01:08:40.203
You can do this.

01:08:40.270 --> 01:08:43.541
Father, please
give me strength.

01:08:43.608 --> 01:08:47.176
Josephine, they're
trying to distract you.

01:08:48.345 --> 01:08:51.081
Do not focus on the
manifestation of evil.

01:08:56.086 --> 01:08:58.723
Josephine, Josephine, Josephine.

01:08:58.790 --> 01:09:00.323
You're stronger than you know.

01:09:01.559 --> 01:09:03.895
Focus on the power within you.

01:09:12.036 --> 01:09:13.904
I've
missed you, Josephine.

01:09:15.439 --> 01:09:17.341
I've missed you, Josephine.

01:09:17.407 --> 01:09:18.609
I've missed you, Josphine.

01:09:18.676 --> 01:09:20.812
Come give your mama
a hug, baby girl.

01:09:20.877 --> 01:09:22.779
Mommy, mommy, where are you?

01:09:24.381 --> 01:09:25.247
Mommy?

01:09:26.618 --> 01:09:30.153
Josephine, they're
trying to distract you.

01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:33.591
Do not focus on the
manifestation of evil.

01:09:35.292 --> 01:09:37.895
Father Peter told
you you had epilepsy.

01:09:37.962 --> 01:09:40.832
He told you this to
protect you from the truth.

01:09:40.898 --> 01:09:44.836
Every seizure you had
was the work of demons

01:09:44.902 --> 01:09:46.370
trying to enter your soul.

01:09:47.904 --> 01:09:49.339
Why would Father
Peter let me think

01:09:49.406 --> 01:09:51.809
I was sick my whole life?

01:09:51.876 --> 01:09:53.143
Why?

01:09:53.210 --> 01:09:55.212
He feared if
he told you the truth,

01:09:55.278 --> 01:09:57.247
it would be an entry
point for demons

01:09:57.314 --> 01:09:58.650
to come into your life.

01:10:01.385 --> 01:10:04.489
I accept the truth of my past,

01:10:04.555 --> 01:10:07.257
and I forgive those who hurt me.

01:10:07.324 --> 01:10:10.028
I forgive you for
hurting me, Mommy.

01:10:10.094 --> 01:10:11.896
You know what
to do, Josephine.

01:10:11.963 --> 01:10:13.831
Do it!

01:10:13.898 --> 01:10:14.999
Do it!

01:10:33.383 --> 01:10:34.251
Do it!

01:10:51.435 --> 01:10:52.837
Go to your sister, Josephine.

01:10:54.072 --> 01:10:55.338
We only have a short time.

01:10:59.577 --> 01:11:00.712
This isn't over.

01:11:02.613 --> 01:11:05.449
Maddie, Maddie, I
know you're in there.

01:11:05.516 --> 01:11:08.920
Please, please hear
me, sister, I love you.

01:11:08.986 --> 01:11:10.888
Sister please, you're
the most important person

01:11:10.955 --> 01:11:12.924
in my life, please
don't leave me.

01:11:15.392 --> 01:11:16.561
The time is now, Josephine.

01:11:16.627 --> 01:11:17.962
Close the door on evil.

01:11:21.431 --> 01:11:23.668
In the name of the
Father and the Son

01:11:23.735 --> 01:11:25.002
and the Holy Spirit.

01:11:27.437 --> 01:11:30.208
Oh God of peace, subdue
Satan beneath our feet.

01:11:34.377 --> 01:11:37.115
Oh God of peace, subdue
Satan beneath our feet.

01:11:43.121 --> 01:11:44.321
I love you, sister!

01:11:45.757 --> 01:11:47.825
Sister, I love you,
you're my everything!

01:11:48.926 --> 01:11:49.794
Sister, please.

01:12:09.714 --> 01:12:10.882
What happened?

01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:13.985
Is she okay?

01:12:28.666 --> 01:12:31.269
Sister?

01:12:31.334 --> 01:12:32.203
Sister?

01:12:36.373 --> 01:12:37.241
Jo.

01:12:42.113 --> 01:12:42.980
Maddie?

01:12:46.884 --> 01:12:47.752
Jo.

01:12:50.721 --> 01:12:51.589
Hi, Jo.

01:12:56.527 --> 01:12:57.394
Jo.

01:13:14.645 --> 01:13:15.746
You saved me!

01:13:41.305 --> 01:13:42.405
Where are we?

01:13:43.975 --> 01:13:46.477
Why are you wearing
Father Peter's robe?

01:13:49.113 --> 01:13:50.181
Is he still here?

01:13:54.785 --> 01:13:56.453
Father Peter is
always with us.

01:13:57.521 --> 01:14:00.625
He's just in another room.

01:14:16.641 --> 01:14:18.843
In my Father's house
there are many rooms.

01:14:20.011 --> 01:14:22.780
If it were not so, would
I not have told you

01:14:22.847 --> 01:14:25.016
that I go there to
prepare a place for you.

01:14:26.617 --> 01:14:29.587
No more tears now, my little Jo.

01:14:29.654 --> 01:14:31.122
Go my faith with you.

01:14:41.933 --> 01:14:42.967
I'm always with you.

01:14:44.902 --> 01:14:46.971
I'm just in another room.

01:15:05.589 --> 01:15:08.626
What man of you,
if your son asks you

01:15:08.693 --> 01:15:11.963
for a loaf of bread,
would give him a stone?

01:15:12.029 --> 01:15:14.732
Or a fish and give
him a serpent?

01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:19.837
If you, then, who are
evil know how to give

01:15:19.904 --> 01:15:21.539
good gifts to your children,

01:15:21.605 --> 01:15:24.108
so how much more so
would your Father

01:15:24.175 --> 01:15:26.277
who is in heaven,
know how to give

01:15:26.344 --> 01:15:29.413
good gifts to all
those who ask Him?

01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:30.581
Amen.

01:15:30.648 --> 01:15:31.949
Amen!
