10:14.439 --> 10:16.790
You know, rotations are
advertised Navy-wide.

10:16.833 --> 10:19.140
MC personnel are
all over the country

10:22.491 --> 10:24.362
And what were her assignments?

10:24.406 --> 10:27.931
She was a journalist,
lithographer, uh, illustrator,

10:27.975 --> 10:29.716

photographer all in one.

10:29.759 --> 10:31.587

an important role.

It is.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.635
Much of her recent work
was spent documenting

10:35.678 --> 10:37.680

formal, staged pictures,

she-she thought outside the box.

10:47.734 --> 10:50.780

of that weapons station.

stole her camera and her laptop.

sensitive information?

10:55.785 --> 10:59.049

Almost certainly yes.

20:05.508 --> 20:07.293
I mean, you went through
this exact same thing.

20:07.336 --> 20:09.599
[stammers]
How are we back here again?

20:09.643 --> 20:12.341
The more things change, the more
they stay the same, huh?

20:12.385 --> 20:14.996
Look, Rountree's sister
means everything to him.

20:15.039 --> 20:16.389
We are not
letting this slide.

20:18.478 --> 20:21.220
I feel like a hamster running
on a wheel getting nowhere.

20:22.177 --> 20:24.353
Tell me what you want to do.

20:25.572 --> 20:28.531
Rountree's taking the lead.

20:28.575 --> 20:29.576
Let's just be ready.

20:29.619 --> 20:31.360
Okay.

20:33.101 --> 20:36.235
The meantime,
we're gonna focus on the case.

20:36.278 --> 20:37.758
Yeah.

20:39.716 --> 20:42.023
[grunting]

20:42.066 --> 20:43.807
FATIMA:
Okay, so Andrea Bishop

20:43.851 --> 20:46.375
used the thumb drive as backup
for her projects at the station.

20:46.419 --> 20:47.985
This is a time-lapse video

20:48.029 --> 20:49.900
of the pier restoration,

20:49.944 --> 20:53.426
uh, slice-of-life videos
of Navy personnel at work.

20:53.469 --> 20:57.604
And then there's this:
a file labeled "Northcutt."

20:57.647 --> 21:01.521
Now, this is an enhanced
section of a time-lapse video

21:01.564 --> 21:03.697
from the construction site
near the pier.

21:03.740 --> 21:06.047
Now, the time stamp
says 1:00 a.m.

21:06.090 --> 21:08.049
KILBRIDE:
Odd hour to be
doing work,

21:08.092 --> 21:09.006
wouldn't you agree?

21:09.050 --> 21:10.356
Is that the only clip?

21:10.399 --> 21:12.009
No, she has clips of this
going down

21:12.053 --> 21:13.489
one night every month.

21:13.533 --> 21:16.144
How do you explain
the repetition?

21:16.187 --> 21:18.320
Well, I thought the dates
were random at first,

21:18.364 --> 21:20.453
until I realized
that this is happening

21:20.496 --> 21:22.019
the same night
the security system

21:22.063 --> 21:23.282
undergoes routine maintenance.

21:23.325 --> 21:24.805
And is Bishop's camera
the only one

21:24.848 --> 21:26.502
that this van appears on?It is.

21:27.808 --> 21:31.028
CALLEN:
We have no evidence that
anyone's been targeting her.

21:31.072 --> 21:34.118
Maybe this isn't about
foreign interest

21:34.162 --> 21:36.904
in the pier construction.

21:36.947 --> 21:41.082
Maybe she was killed
to cover up a theft.

21:41.125 --> 21:43.780
Has the weapons station
reported any missing inventory

21:43.824 --> 21:45.652
since Bishop's
time-lapse began?I was just checking that,

21:45.695 --> 21:47.523
and bingo.

21:47.567 --> 21:50.657
Last week, NCIS Resident
Unit Seal Beach opened

21:50.700 --> 21:52.006
an investigation into
the missing inventory

21:52.049 --> 21:53.834
at the station.

21:53.877 --> 21:56.315
Oh, tactical gear,
avionics, electronics.

21:56.358 --> 21:57.620
All right, send
this report to Sam.

21:57.664 --> 21:59.622
You got it.

21:59.666 --> 22:03.191
So, Andrea Bishop recorded

22:03.234 --> 22:06.107
someone stealing from
the weapons station.

22:06.150 --> 22:08.109
Someone who knows
the time and dates

22:08.152 --> 22:09.763
that the security system
undergoes maintenance.

22:09.806 --> 22:12.505
Appears to be
an inside job.

22:12.548 --> 22:14.637
There's no chance that
you could ID them

22:14.681 --> 22:16.204
or the van, perhaps?

22:16.247 --> 22:19.686
Hmm. It's too dark
to ID off their faces,

22:19.729 --> 22:21.470
but I can get the plate.

22:21.514 --> 22:23.951
That would work.

22:23.994 --> 22:26.345
Bishop labeled this file
"Northcutt,"

22:26.388 --> 22:28.347
but Northcutt and Walsh

22:28.390 --> 22:29.522
never mentioned
anything about it.

22:29.565 --> 22:33.439
Which suggests
that she got killed

22:33.482 --> 22:35.005
before she could tell them.

22:35.049 --> 22:38.922
Or that one of them's
covering up.

22:38.966 --> 22:40.184
[tablet beeps]

22:40.228 --> 22:41.490
We got a hit on the van.

22:41.534 --> 22:43.100
It's registered
to a Jake Hanson.

22:43.144 --> 22:45.276
KILBRIDE:
Is he weapons
station personnel?

22:45.320 --> 22:48.715
No, it looks like
he's unemployed.

22:48.758 --> 22:50.717
All right, send this info
to Kensi and Deeks.

22:50.760 --> 22:53.546
Sam and I will get Northcutt
and Walsh back on the line.

22:58.159 --> 23:00.335
Detective Whiting?

23:01.945 --> 23:03.686
Agent Rountree,
thank you for coming.

23:03.730 --> 23:05.166
Hmm.Admiral Kilbride thought

23:05.209 --> 23:07.124
we should speak one on one.

23:07.168 --> 23:08.952
Understood.

23:08.996 --> 23:12.129
The video's already been
viewed thousands of times.

23:12.173 --> 23:14.349
We need to get ahead
of this before...

23:14.393 --> 23:16.438
Before it becomes
a PR nightmare?

23:16.482 --> 23:18.919
Before the wrong story is told.

23:18.962 --> 23:21.225
I'm a federal agent
driving my little sister

23:21.269 --> 23:22.531
to a science exam.

23:22.575 --> 23:25.229
The video speaks
for itself.

23:25.273 --> 23:27.754
I'm sorry
it got to that point.

23:27.797 --> 23:30.104
But you didn't have
your badge, and...[scoffs]

23:30.147 --> 23:32.541
My badge?

23:32.585 --> 23:34.587
Badge or no badge,
that wasn't cool.

23:34.630 --> 23:36.502
Listen, sit down
with the officers.

23:36.545 --> 23:39.026
This is bigger than
those officers.

23:39.069 --> 23:41.071
Let's hear
what they have to say.

23:41.115 --> 23:42.899
I already know
what they're gonna say.

23:42.943 --> 23:44.727
They're gonna say that
they were doing their jobs.

23:44.771 --> 23:46.381
Which is the problem.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.427
So a conversation is
a good idea, then.

23:48.470 --> 23:51.386
A good idea is
changing the system.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.083
The culture.

23:53.127 --> 23:55.216
How does that happen
without talking?

23:55.259 --> 23:57.392
Look, I don't want to talk,
all right?

23:57.436 --> 23:59.481
I don't want to march
in the street holding hands.

23:59.525 --> 24:02.832
And I damn sure don't want
a viral video or a hashtag.

24:02.876 --> 24:04.878
What doyou want?

24:04.921 --> 24:05.966
Change.

24:06.009 --> 24:07.750
Come on.

24:07.794 --> 24:10.013
We've made enormous strides
in that department.

24:10.057 --> 24:12.842
Implicit bias training,
new regulations.

24:12.886 --> 24:14.453
How about a new narrative?

24:14.496 --> 24:16.019
Hmm?

24:16.063 --> 24:19.066
How about I should be able
to get in my car,

24:19.109 --> 24:21.198
drive my little sister to school

24:21.242 --> 24:23.418
without being perceived
as a threat!

24:23.462 --> 24:25.333
I've been a woman

24:25.376 --> 24:27.901
working in this department
for over a decade.

24:27.944 --> 24:30.599
I got a long list of
"I should be able to."

24:30.643 --> 24:32.862
[scoffs]

24:32.906 --> 24:36.431
Well, you start addressing
your list, Detective.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.477
I'll be addressing mine.

24:41.784 --> 24:42.916
Starting to look like you're
holding out on us, Commander.

24:42.959 --> 24:44.874
Not at all, Agent Callen.

24:44.918 --> 24:47.268
Then why didn't you mention the
recent thefts at the station?

24:47.311 --> 24:49.270
Our inventory shows
discrepancies,

24:49.313 --> 24:51.359
and we're working
with the resident NCIS agent

24:51.402 --> 24:53.230
to resolve the matter.

24:53.274 --> 24:54.928
I certainly didn't think
it was relevant

24:54.971 --> 24:56.625
to Petty Officer Bishop's
murder.

24:56.669 --> 24:58.366
It is if she came to you
with video evidence

24:58.409 --> 25:00.020
that someone was burglarizing
the station.

25:00.063 --> 25:01.848
Well, I assure you, she did not.

25:01.891 --> 25:03.850
Sir. Uh, with all the
construction going on,

25:03.893 --> 25:05.721
our assumption was
that the items had...

25:05.765 --> 25:07.462
they'd just
been misplaced.

25:07.506 --> 25:08.550
Well, the video seems
to indicate otherwise.

25:08.594 --> 25:10.639
Like I said,
I gave her free rein

25:10.683 --> 25:11.901
to document
the pier construction.

25:11.945 --> 25:13.947
And now I'm glad I did.

25:13.990 --> 25:16.253
Hopefully, this video will
show whoever's responsible

25:16.297 --> 25:19.387
both for the thefts and
Petty Officer Bishop's murder.

25:19.430 --> 25:21.258
Please find
them, Agents.

25:21.302 --> 25:22.912
We will.

25:25.698 --> 25:27.743
So...

25:27.787 --> 25:29.571
you starting to get the feeling
there's more to this story?

25:29.615 --> 25:32.182
Yeah, and we're getting
the Cliff Notes version.Mm-hmm.

25:32.226 --> 25:36.099
So the resident NCIS agent opens
the investigation last week.

25:36.143 --> 25:38.406
Bishop realizes her clips
of a van entering the base

25:38.449 --> 25:40.582
may be connected
to the missing inventory.

25:40.626 --> 25:42.802
If I'm her, I'm not waiting to
show those clips to Northcutt.

25:42.845 --> 25:45.587
Nah, I'd do it right away.Someone's lying.

25:45.631 --> 25:47.850
Well, let's find out where they
were on the night of the murder.

25:57.730 --> 26:00.297
Well, that was clearly
racial profiling

26:00.341 --> 26:01.734
and an excessive
use of force.

26:01.777 --> 26:03.300
Yeah, we got
to pay the precinct a visit.

26:03.344 --> 26:05.128
[sighs]
Yeah, we should,

26:05.172 --> 26:06.565
but Rountree wants to
handle it on his own, so...

26:06.608 --> 26:09.002
God, it pisses me off.

26:09.045 --> 26:10.743
Anything like this ever happen
when you were on patrol?

26:10.786 --> 26:13.180
No, 'cause no one's gonna
try this with me around.

26:13.223 --> 26:15.530
Just don't understand why
this keeps happening, you know?

26:15.574 --> 26:16.923
Or better yet,
how can we stop it?

26:16.966 --> 26:18.446
Those are great questions.

26:18.489 --> 26:19.969
I usually like
to have a few beers

26:20.013 --> 26:21.536
before I start solving
the world's problems.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.233
Just hope Rountree's okay.

26:23.277 --> 26:24.626
You know what
it makes me think about?

26:24.670 --> 26:26.323
What?
My dad.

26:26.367 --> 26:28.717
What a sad, sad, scared man
he must've been

26:28.761 --> 26:30.632
to treat people
the way that he did.

26:30.676 --> 26:34.027
That he thought he was superior
to anyone is just laughable.

26:35.811 --> 26:38.335
That's the kind of complex
that destroys families.

26:38.379 --> 26:39.772
And nations.

26:40.729 --> 26:42.775
And nations.

26:43.732 --> 26:45.691
[door opens]

26:45.734 --> 26:46.822
Kens?

26:51.044 --> 26:53.176
Jake Hanson, federal agents.
We'd like to speak to you.

26:55.744 --> 26:58.138
No!

26:58.181 --> 27:00.401
Out of the car.

27:09.932 --> 27:12.674
Come on, dude. We've been
doing this for a while.

27:23.642 --> 27:26.688
So help us understand why
your van was repeatedly seen

27:26.732 --> 27:28.603
breaking into the
weapons station.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.170
I park it right here
every night.

27:30.213 --> 27:31.475
Somebody could've
easily stolen it.

27:31.519 --> 27:33.086
And then returned it to you?

27:33.129 --> 27:35.392
Car thieves can be
very thoughtful.

27:35.436 --> 27:37.307
And now for the truth.

27:37.351 --> 27:39.658
The truth is...
[inhales sharply]

27:39.701 --> 27:41.181
I need a lawyer.

27:41.224 --> 27:43.183
Oh, that's fine.
You can get your lawyer.

27:43.226 --> 27:45.576
Why don't you get a homicide
charge while you're at it?Yup.

27:45.620 --> 27:46.795
Whoa. What?

27:46.839 --> 27:49.058
Yeah.

27:49.102 --> 27:51.757
You killed U.S. Navy
Petty Officer Andrea Bishop.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.802
Wait. I was just transportation.

27:53.846 --> 27:55.717
I didn't kill anybody.
I don't even know who that is.

27:55.761 --> 27:58.502
She caught you on video stealing
from the weapons station.

27:58.546 --> 28:01.070
Oh, man.

28:01.114 --> 28:03.029
Yeah, so what do you want to do?
You want to get a lawyer

28:03.072 --> 28:04.291
or you want to clear this up
right here, right now?

28:05.771 --> 28:07.381
Let's start with the operations.

28:07.424 --> 28:08.991
How big was the team?

28:10.253 --> 28:12.560
Uh, me and one other guy.

28:12.603 --> 28:14.431
I drove,
took stuff where he told me.

28:14.475 --> 28:15.824
I don't know what it was.

28:15.868 --> 28:17.826
What's his name?Don't know that either.

28:17.870 --> 28:20.089
He hired me to do a job,
not to make small talk.

28:20.133 --> 28:21.830
What can you tell us
about this guy?

28:21.874 --> 28:25.573
Didn't see his face.
He wore a mask.

28:25.616 --> 28:27.749
I think he worked
at the weapons station,

28:27.793 --> 28:30.360
'cause he was at the
security booth letting me in.

28:30.404 --> 28:32.101
So how did he find you?

28:32.145 --> 28:33.973
Online.

28:34.016 --> 28:35.757
Look, like I told you,
I'm just transportation.

28:35.801 --> 28:37.237
My nickname's "Wheels."

28:37.280 --> 28:39.152
You know, boom,
point A to point B.

28:39.195 --> 28:42.677
So if point A is weapons
station, then where is point B?

28:42.721 --> 28:45.114
Warehouse way out in Indio.

28:45.158 --> 28:46.855
Address is on my phone.

28:51.904 --> 28:53.470
[camera clicks]

28:53.514 --> 28:55.385
Perfect. I'll send it
to Callen and Sam.

28:56.604 --> 28:58.867
Where are we with the case?

28:58.911 --> 29:02.349
Don't worry about it.
Go home, regroup.

29:02.392 --> 29:05.091
No, I'm good.
Catch me up, please.

29:07.354 --> 29:09.748
Okay, fine, but first,
I got to do something.

29:09.791 --> 29:11.097
Okay.

29:22.935 --> 29:26.982
Okay. So, Jake Hanson
was hired to transport

29:27.026 --> 29:28.897
the stolen equipment
from the weapons station

29:28.941 --> 29:31.334
by someone using the
service platform ChoreChart.

29:31.378 --> 29:33.206
Now, ChoreChart is
helping us track down

29:33.249 --> 29:35.425
the IP of the user
that hired Hanson.

29:36.862 --> 29:40.648
So, could you cross-reference
the missing inventory

29:40.691 --> 29:43.390
with known dark web markets,
see if anything pops up?

29:43.433 --> 29:44.826
Yeah, you got it.Great.

29:45.871 --> 29:48.177
Well, takes two hours
to get to Indio,

29:48.221 --> 29:50.963
and the magistrate signs the
search warrant in ten minutes.

29:52.007 --> 29:53.922
Guess they want to recover
the stolen gear

29:53.966 --> 29:56.011
