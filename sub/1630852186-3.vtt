WEBVTT

00:06.583 --> 00:09.041
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:18.166 --> 00:19.000
STOP FRAUD

00:19.083 --> 00:20.708
TRAITORS

01:35.041 --> 01:36.583
They're attacking the bank.

01:37.166 --> 01:38.708
They're attacking the bank.

01:40.083 --> 01:41.583
Seal off the building!

01:41.666 --> 01:44.750
I repeat, seal off the building!

01:44.833 --> 01:47.166
Red protocol, sealing the doors.
I repeat,

01:47.250 --> 01:48.875
<i>we're sealing the bank doors.</i>

01:48.958 --> 01:51.791
<i>Everyone, put on your vests.</i>
<i>All of you!</i>

01:58.458 --> 02:00.833
And then the Bank of Spain will be sealed.

03:05.208 --> 03:06.541
Even when sealed off,

03:07.291 --> 03:08.916
the building is very big, Professor.

03:10.041 --> 03:12.125
Too many windows, not enough men.

03:12.750 --> 03:14.208
We can't defend the whole thing.

03:14.833 --> 03:16.250
Good point, Helsinki.

03:19.416 --> 03:21.416
A really good point, but...

03:22.375 --> 03:23.375
this building...

03:25.125 --> 03:26.333
has its own secrets.

03:28.083 --> 03:31.208
This is the part of the Bank of Spain
that interests us.

03:31.291 --> 03:34.083
The structure is covered
with concrete walls

03:34.166 --> 03:37.333
and steel sheets 180 centimeters thick.

03:37.416 --> 03:38.416
From the outside,

03:39.375 --> 03:41.000
it is a true safe.

03:42.083 --> 03:44.458
From the inside,
it's an impenetrable fort.

03:45.875 --> 03:49.083
Once red protocol is activated,
nobody, and I mean nobody,

03:49.166 --> 03:51.625
will be allowed to go in or out
for one hour.

03:53.791 --> 03:57.000
That's the time we need
to obtain a key piece

03:58.125 --> 03:59.583
for stage two of our plan.

04:01.291 --> 04:02.125
What piece?

04:06.750 --> 04:08.750
The Governor of the Bank of Spain.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.708
He'll be in his office,

04:11.791 --> 04:14.625
escorted by five personal bodyguards

04:14.708 --> 04:17.250
with a poor sense of humor.

04:17.750 --> 04:19.458
I call that the ghost train.

04:20.291 --> 04:22.583
<i>Everyone knows</i>
<i>something weird is going on</i>

04:22.666 --> 04:24.125
and things will jump out,

04:24.250 --> 04:26.500
but no one really knows from where.

04:30.541 --> 04:33.291
Governor, sir, I'm Lieutenant Lorenzo.

04:33.625 --> 04:34.625
You must come with us.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.916
We need to evacuate you immediately.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.041
Thank you, Amanda.

04:39.625 --> 04:42.375
For now, I'm not leaving my office.

04:43.666 --> 04:44.500
Sir.

04:45.083 --> 04:47.583
It's a direct order
from General Salas Núñez.

04:47.916 --> 04:49.958
-It comes from above.
-I received it,

04:50.500 --> 04:51.666
but I'm not following it.

04:52.583 --> 04:56.041
I'm not leaving the Bank until
the last employee has left.

04:56.791 --> 04:58.875
So, if you want to protect me,

04:58.958 --> 05:02.041
you'll have to sit down and wait.

05:02.916 --> 05:03.791
Coffee, anyone?

05:04.791 --> 05:06.166
Amanda, if you please.

05:07.208 --> 05:08.375
Come in, come in.

05:12.875 --> 05:15.500
<i>At that moment,</i>
<i>I wondered what Nairobi might be thinking.</i>

05:16.458 --> 05:18.416
<i>I only had one thought my mind:</i>

05:19.000 --> 05:21.750
<i>to draw my gun</i>
<i>and rain hell down on them.</i>

05:23.416 --> 05:24.250
Get some rest.

05:25.375 --> 05:26.208
Take a seat.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.583
May I ask what regiment you belong to?

05:46.125 --> 05:48.208
We're airborne sappers

05:48.291 --> 05:49.416
from BRIPAC,

05:49.916 --> 05:51.333
sixth brigade.

05:52.291 --> 05:55.250
With demining missions in Mali, Lebanon,

05:55.333 --> 05:56.166
Afghanistan.

05:56.250 --> 05:57.541
<i>There were five bodyguards.</i>

05:57.625 --> 05:59.666
<i>We had two guns each,</i>

05:59.750 --> 06:02.541
<i>so we could each take out two men.</i>

06:03.041 --> 06:04.750
<i>It was still one too many.</i>

06:06.291 --> 06:07.708
Very risky business.

06:08.500 --> 06:09.625
By the way,

06:09.708 --> 06:12.333
how do you deactivate
an anti-personnel mine?

06:12.833 --> 06:13.666
It depends.

06:18.666 --> 06:20.708
There are many types of mines

06:20.791 --> 06:25.000
and each one has a different mechanism.

06:25.083 --> 06:28.916
There are the Green Parrots,
the Butterfly, the PMF1...

06:30.708 --> 06:33.208
Some are activated by methods

06:33.291 --> 06:35.291
that would defuse others.

06:35.375 --> 06:37.375
Some explode due to movement.

06:37.458 --> 06:39.291
Some...

06:39.875 --> 06:42.500
explode when being opened.
Some even explode

06:42.583 --> 06:44.958
when you get too close to them.

06:45.041 --> 06:46.333
May I go to the toilet?

06:49.875 --> 06:51.916
By all means. You can use mine.

06:52.000 --> 06:52.833
Excuse me.

06:54.041 --> 06:55.000
Amanda, if you please.

06:56.916 --> 06:57.750
This way.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.916
The worst are the Russian.

07:15.916 --> 07:18.583
<i>The Professor had prepared us</i>
<i>for any event.</i>

07:19.791 --> 07:20.958
<i>But let's be honest.</i>

07:22.708 --> 07:23.916
<i>Theory is one thing.</i>

07:24.541 --> 07:26.083
<i>The actual action, another.</i>

07:26.166 --> 07:27.666
Go!

07:27.750 --> 07:29.250
Move!

07:37.958 --> 07:39.208
You'll be safe here.

07:48.458 --> 07:51.291
Nothing to worry about
among writers and poets.

07:51.916 --> 07:52.750
Stay calm.

07:54.833 --> 07:55.833
Hands in the air.

07:59.375 --> 08:01.041
Like this. Like in a robbery.

08:05.125 --> 08:05.958
Come on.

08:06.916 --> 08:07.750
Very good.

08:08.625 --> 08:10.125
Ladies and gentlemen,

08:11.958 --> 08:13.416
my name is Palermo.

08:14.291 --> 08:16.458
And I have two pieces of news for you.

08:17.583 --> 08:18.666
Good and bad.

08:19.375 --> 08:22.458
The bad one is that the Bank of Spain
is under attack.

08:23.250 --> 08:24.166
The good one...

08:26.666 --> 08:28.833
We are the attackers!

08:36.000 --> 08:37.416
Keep calm! Keep calm!

08:37.500 --> 08:38.625
Keep calm!

08:38.708 --> 08:40.333
Everyone, keep calm!

08:43.041 --> 08:44.166
VP13.

08:45.166 --> 08:46.250
VP13?

08:46.625 --> 08:49.291
They have an electronic fuse

08:49.375 --> 08:51.541
controlled by a seismic sensor.

08:53.958 --> 08:55.125
Touch them...

08:55.833 --> 08:57.125
and you're fucked.

09:04.541 --> 09:06.416
Afghanistan was full of them.

09:22.041 --> 09:23.541
I see you're well trained.

09:23.625 --> 09:24.875
Sir, do not move.

09:29.208 --> 09:30.875
Are you OK, Lieutenant?

09:38.750 --> 09:39.583
Lieutenant!

09:58.500 --> 09:59.625
Governor, sir...

10:01.375 --> 10:03.125
Now you must come with us.

10:04.375 --> 10:05.208
Get up.

10:07.041 --> 10:07.875
Come with me.

10:13.041 --> 10:14.208
What are you doing?

10:31.500 --> 10:32.500
Don't move.

10:39.541 --> 10:40.458
Guns down!

10:40.875 --> 10:41.875
Don't move!

10:42.625 --> 10:43.541
Don't move!

10:53.958 --> 10:54.791
Well...

10:55.375 --> 10:57.875
This doesn't look good for either of us.

11:00.458 --> 11:01.750
Let's call it quits.

11:02.208 --> 11:04.333
Quits? You think
we've reached a draw?

11:06.083 --> 11:08.208
You won't shoot the governor,

11:08.625 --> 11:10.291
but I'll do this bitch in.

11:16.125 --> 11:17.625
I'll do it.

11:21.041 --> 11:21.875
Gandía!

11:22.416 --> 11:23.416
Release the girl.

11:26.708 --> 11:28.583
Calm down, Amanda.

11:28.666 --> 11:29.666
It's okay.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.500
-Gandía, release the girl.
-No.

11:32.833 --> 11:35.333
I don't want anyone harmed.
That is an order.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.458
Gandía, release the girl!

11:46.541 --> 11:47.750
I'm going with them.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.958
And I don't want you to do anything.

11:51.041 --> 11:51.875
That's right.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.958
I don't know what you want,
but there's no way out.

12:08.041 --> 12:09.375
Then we stay.

12:30.666 --> 12:31.708
Fire!

12:37.833 --> 12:38.666
Shit!

12:38.750 --> 12:39.583
What the fuck!

12:39.666 --> 12:40.500
Shit!

12:40.583 --> 12:41.791
What just happened?

12:41.875 --> 12:43.250
What just happened?

12:43.333 --> 12:45.250
-Shit! Okay...
-What are you doing?

12:45.333 --> 12:47.541
They're going down. We need to go up.

12:49.791 --> 12:51.708
-We're going down.
-Going down?

12:51.791 --> 12:54.583
If we stay here, they shoot us.
Better to get out.

12:55.416 --> 12:57.291
Let's gate-crash it, Tokyo style.

13:01.166 --> 13:02.458
Shit's about to hit the fan.

13:03.833 --> 13:07.916
Now you belong
to our wonderful hostage family.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.666
We'll enjoy some days
of complete disconnection.

13:11.166 --> 13:13.750
Take the masks and put them on, please.

13:15.875 --> 13:17.875
Put the fucking masks on!

13:19.375 --> 13:22.041
So that nobody feels inclined
to be a hero,

13:22.125 --> 13:25.166
hand in your mobile phones
to my mate, Denver.

13:29.500 --> 13:30.708
Let's do it this way.

13:31.541 --> 13:33.708
Raise your hands if you're parents.

13:35.708 --> 13:36.541
Okay.

13:36.708 --> 13:38.875
We'll tag your mobile phones in red,

13:38.958 --> 13:41.125
so you can make one phone call a day.

13:41.541 --> 13:43.333
Where's that coming from, moron?

13:43.875 --> 13:46.541
Because I say so
and I'm the hostage coordinator.

13:47.250 --> 13:48.750
Did you take a course?

13:50.166 --> 13:51.625
Are you daddy of the year?

13:54.708 --> 13:56.875
Hand in your mobile phones now!

14:02.500 --> 14:04.541
What about this white strawberry?

14:04.625 --> 14:07.041
Oh, my God! You're such a snob, Tokyo!

14:07.125 --> 14:08.750
He's such a cutie.

14:08.833 --> 14:09.875
What's his name?

14:10.916 --> 14:12.125
Ask his father.

14:13.041 --> 14:13.875
Cincinnati.

14:13.958 --> 14:14.958
No, come on!

14:15.041 --> 14:16.916
The love of my life seated here

14:17.000 --> 14:19.750
wanted Cynthia when we thought
he was a girl.

14:19.833 --> 14:20.666
However...

14:21.666 --> 14:23.333
They misread the ultrasound.

14:23.416 --> 14:25.541
-Why?
-I only had the first one done.

14:25.625 --> 14:28.000
Do you remember where that was?

14:28.083 --> 14:29.625
-Yes.
-In Sulawao.

14:29.708 --> 14:31.583
-In Sulawesi.
-Sulawesi.

14:31.666 --> 14:32.958
-Sulawesi.
-That one.

14:33.041 --> 14:35.833
It looked like a filthy bike garage.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.083
Unbelievable!

14:37.166 --> 14:38.541
And we never went back.

14:38.625 --> 14:42.166
They took a bullet out of me
during the war in a tractor garage.

14:42.250 --> 14:44.625
-You never told me that, cub.
-For real.

14:44.708 --> 14:46.625
-Where?
-In the ass. Wanna see?

14:47.333 --> 14:48.500
-No...
-No!

14:48.583 --> 14:50.708
Show them your pet, come one, Helsi.

14:50.791 --> 14:53.625
-No.
-Come on! Show them your pet, come on.

14:53.708 --> 14:55.125
-Huh?
-They're family.

14:55.208 --> 14:57.291
OK. Check this out.
I have a new...

14:57.375 --> 14:58.750
No way!

14:58.833 --> 14:59.875
Don't look!

14:59.958 --> 15:01.208
What are you doing?

15:03.250 --> 15:05.250
-It can talk.
-Hey, big man,

15:05.333 --> 15:07.125
want me to train your bear?

15:08.875 --> 15:11.125
I'm good at training animals.

15:18.250 --> 15:21.625
-Did you prefer a girl or a boy, Mónica?
-We didn't care.

15:22.333 --> 15:27.291
We didn't care. You love him or her,
not matter what comes out, right?

15:46.291 --> 15:47.125
It's a boy.

15:48.583 --> 15:49.416
What?

15:57.208 --> 15:58.083
A boy?

16:01.250 --> 16:02.083
It's a boy.

16:04.333 --> 16:05.916
It's a boy!

16:06.000 --> 16:08.125
It's a boy!

16:08.208 --> 16:10.166
It's a boy! A boy!

16:11.416 --> 16:13.083
Boy!

16:13.166 --> 16:14.500
Boy!

16:14.583 --> 16:15.750
It's a boy!

16:15.833 --> 16:18.166
Boy!

16:20.833 --> 16:23.250
What can I say? I was happy.

16:23.333 --> 16:24.166
It's a boy!

16:24.250 --> 16:26.958
You could hear him screaming:
"It's a boy!"

16:27.041 --> 16:30.375
So that's it! From Cynthia...

16:31.833 --> 16:32.916
Cinthy...

16:33.000 --> 16:35.458
Cincy-nati. Cincinnati.

16:35.541 --> 16:36.416
You're insane.

16:36.500 --> 16:37.541
It's pure logic.

16:37.625 --> 16:39.375
He's got a city name.

16:40.083 --> 16:41.500
Like the whole family.

16:41.583 --> 16:42.750
This family.

16:45.416 --> 16:46.666
Cincinnati.

16:47.125 --> 16:47.958
Right?

16:55.333 --> 16:57.625
It's okay, my love. My little boy.

17:01.125 --> 17:02.708
-To him.
-To Cincinnati!

17:02.791 --> 17:04.666
-Well wishes!
-Here, here.

17:04.750 --> 17:05.958
Cheers! To everyone!

17:06.041 --> 17:06.875
Come on.

17:06.958 --> 17:07.791
Guys.

17:08.875 --> 17:11.333
I want to thank you for what you're doing.

17:14.166 --> 17:16.833
In Rio's name and in mine.

17:18.708 --> 17:20.791
-Thank you.
-To Rio!

17:20.875 --> 17:22.041
To Rio! Cheers.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.791
Cheers.

17:33.208 --> 17:35.291
We're doing this for Rio, Tokyo, but...

17:37.916 --> 17:39.333
also for all of us.

17:40.666 --> 17:43.916
Right now, they think they can only win.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.333
Chasing us like animals
and prying us from our holes...

17:48.041 --> 17:51.333
Torturing us. Violating
every human right. Anything goes.

17:52.166 --> 17:55.000
If we hide like rats,

17:55.083 --> 17:56.458
they'll strike again.

17:57.041 --> 17:59.000
One by one.

17:59.291 --> 18:01.166
There's only one way to avoid it.

18:01.708 --> 18:02.916
To face them.

18:03.791 --> 18:04.958
Listen.

18:05.583 --> 18:06.541
In this world...

18:08.375 --> 18:11.083
everything is weighed
on a simple pair of scales:

18:12.125 --> 18:13.458
what you can win

18:14.166 --> 18:16.500
and what you can lose. And right now...

18:17.750 --> 18:20.916
they think they have nothing to lose.

18:22.291 --> 18:24.166
And when you think
you have nothing to lose,

18:25.833 --> 18:26.833
you get stronger.

18:30.250 --> 18:31.083
Well...

18:32.291 --> 18:33.458
we will...

18:34.458 --> 18:36.083
show them...

18:37.916 --> 18:39.625
how much they have...

18:40.541 --> 18:41.500
to lose.

18:53.750 --> 18:55.125
Where's the governor?

18:55.708 --> 18:56.750
Where is he?

18:58.666 --> 18:59.541
Palermo!

19:01.375 --> 19:02.458
We have a problem.

19:08.875 --> 19:09.708
Tokyo.

19:09.791 --> 19:11.333
Take it easy.

19:11.416 --> 19:13.166
-Tokyo.
-Take it easy.

19:26.250 --> 19:28.375
On the count of three, shoot and duck.

19:30.625 --> 19:31.583
One...

19:36.125 --> 19:36.958
Two...

19:40.333 --> 19:41.750
Guns down, you rats!

19:44.250 --> 19:46.791
Ladies and gentlemen,
let me introduce myself.

19:47.958 --> 19:50.291
I'm Palermo
and I'm the one in charge of this robbery.

19:50.375 --> 19:53.875
So, please, aim at my chest.
I'm your most valuable target.

19:53.958 --> 19:54.958
Aim at her!

19:55.041 --> 19:56.041
At her.

19:56.125 --> 19:56.958
Okay...

19:57.458 --> 19:59.833
We have a few seconds
before all the shooting starts,

19:59.916 --> 20:02.000
so let's talk about anatomy.

20:04.250 --> 20:06.208
Human beings have two eyes.

20:06.291 --> 20:07.875
And unlike chameleons,

20:08.125 --> 20:11.625
their eyes are located
in the front of the head and are fixed.

20:14.083 --> 20:17.833
This is clearly a handicap for you
in a shoot-out.

20:17.916 --> 20:20.041
Shoot and your girls will be dead.

20:21.541 --> 20:23.541
I'm talking to you, Gandía.

20:24.458 --> 20:26.791
I know that you go to the firing range
every Sunday,

20:26.875 --> 20:29.041
that you like reading about armaments.

20:29.125 --> 20:32.125
You've been waiting your whole
fucking life for this,

20:32.208 --> 20:33.583
to be a hero.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.375
Let me give you some advice:

20:35.833 --> 20:37.416
think of Marisa,

20:38.000 --> 20:41.333
imagine your son Juanito's angelic face...

20:42.708 --> 20:45.083
and put your fucking gun down very slowly.

20:57.708 --> 20:58.541
Okay.

21:01.000 --> 21:01.833
Okay.

21:30.708 --> 21:32.916
<i>At that moment, the Professor realized</i>

21:33.000 --> 21:36.833
<i>that this job would be very different</i>
<i>from the one at the Royal Mint.</i>

21:37.541 --> 21:39.541
<i>This one didn't come from his head</i>

21:40.458 --> 21:43.041
<i>and he hadn't had the time</i>
<i>to make it his own.</i>

21:44.500 --> 21:48.375
<i>Had he had a rewind button,</i>
<i>he would have pushed it right then.</i>

21:50.166 --> 21:51.458
<i>But he didn't have one.</i>

21:52.416 --> 21:54.000
Are you okay, Tokyo?

21:54.083 --> 21:55.083
Say something!

21:55.541 --> 21:56.375
Are you okay?

21:57.458 --> 21:58.833
Go check on Palermo!

21:58.916 --> 22:02.375
<i>We fired all our bullets at their vests,</i>
<i>following the Professor's instructions.</i>

22:02.458 --> 22:04.500
-Help Palermo!
-<i>But we were too late.</i>

22:24.250 --> 22:27.416
Wake up! Where's the governor?

22:36.000 --> 22:38.875
We have to get him out of here.
Find a stretcher!

22:48.958 --> 22:50.458
Everything's gone to hell!

22:50.541 --> 22:52.333
His eyes are full of glass!

22:52.416 --> 22:53.250
Shit!

23:00.708 --> 23:01.541
Help me!

23:05.500 --> 23:06.333
Move!

23:06.416 --> 23:08.666
Up against the wall! Against the wall!

23:08.750 --> 23:10.333
Come on! Move!

23:11.500 --> 23:13.416
Come on! Hurry up!

23:13.500 --> 23:15.833
-Come on! Hurry up!
-Move!

23:15.916 --> 23:17.458
-Almost there.
-Careful.

23:19.708 --> 23:20.708
It's okay.

23:21.708 --> 23:23.000
Painkillers!

23:24.666 --> 23:27.791
Calm down.
I'm taking this off very slowly.

23:27.875 --> 23:29.083
Slowly... Easy...

23:29.166 --> 23:30.125
Very good.

23:35.833 --> 23:38.708
Okay. Open your eyes now. Slowly.

23:39.375 --> 23:40.291
Come on.

23:43.041 --> 23:43.875
Very good.

23:44.416 --> 23:47.416
I can't keep them open for too long.
I can't.

23:47.500 --> 23:48.583
Can you see?

23:48.666 --> 23:50.750
I can't see shit. What's happening?

23:50.833 --> 23:52.083
Shit.

23:52.750 --> 23:53.625
Okay. Okay.

23:54.375 --> 23:55.583
How about the light?

23:56.625 --> 23:58.541
As if I were in Maracanã Stadium.

23:58.625 --> 24:01.500
Does that mean anything to you?
You think you're an eye doctor now?

24:01.583 --> 24:03.375
He needs an ophthalmologist!

24:03.458 --> 24:04.875
Call the Professor.

24:04.958 --> 24:06.000
I see the glass.

24:06.083 --> 24:08.375
Okay. Stockholm, first aid kit number 4.

24:08.458 --> 24:09.708
-The surgical one.
-OK.

24:09.791 --> 24:10.833
Hurry up.

24:14.208 --> 24:16.875
-What are you going to do, Tokyo?
-I'm going to remove them.

24:16.958 --> 24:18.833
-Really? How?
-With tweezers.

24:18.916 --> 24:20.500
I wouldn't do that, Tokyo.

24:20.583 --> 24:22.500
Call the Professor
and release three hostages

24:22.583 --> 24:24.416
-for an eye doctor.
-Denver!

24:24.500 --> 24:26.416
-Shut up and leave!
-Okay.

24:26.500 --> 24:27.875
Listen to me, Palermo.

24:27.958 --> 24:30.750
My hand is steadier than
a Swiss watchmaker's.

24:30.833 --> 24:32.750
I'm getting that glass out.

24:32.833 --> 24:35.500
Do you know
why they use lasers for eye surgery?

24:35.583 --> 24:37.166
-Yes.
-For just a tiny detail.

24:37.250 --> 24:42.250
Precision. Eye operations need
to be precise to the micrometer.

24:42.333 --> 24:44.125
Check this out, Denver.

24:44.208 --> 24:46.166
Tokyo wants to use
the same tweezers she uses

24:46.250 --> 24:48.500
to trim her jungle down there.

24:48.583 --> 24:50.000
Come on!

24:50.083 --> 24:51.000
Nonsense!

24:52.875 --> 24:53.916
Say it again.

24:54.750 --> 24:55.583
Say it again.

24:57.041 --> 24:58.500
How was it?

24:59.625 --> 25:03.583
I'm sure
your peach down there is all silky.

25:03.666 --> 25:05.708
Now say, "I will never mention

25:05.791 --> 25:08.375
my colleagues' pussies ever again."

25:08.458 --> 25:11.333
I will never mention
my colleagues' pussies again.

25:11.416 --> 25:12.583
I didn't get that.

25:13.208 --> 25:16.875
-I'll never mention your pussy, bitch.
-Fucking great, Palermo.

25:18.416 --> 25:19.583
At your service.

25:19.666 --> 25:21.791
Okay. We'll deal with my eyes later.

25:22.333 --> 25:24.250
-Denver, on my right.
-What's up?

25:24.333 --> 25:27.375
Give me your arm.
You're my second in command now.

25:27.458 --> 25:30.041
-I'm your damn guide dog now?
-Silence!

25:30.500 --> 25:31.875
-Tokyo!
-What?

25:32.375 --> 25:35.875
We have 14 tons of steel below.
Tell me Nairobi is with Bogotá.

25:35.958 --> 25:36.791
That's right.

25:37.583 --> 25:38.458
Let's go.

25:39.541 --> 25:41.541
Listen. What are you doing?

25:42.208 --> 25:44.333
Are you going to tie us up like dogs?

25:44.416 --> 25:45.291
I'm not.

25:45.875 --> 25:49.625
We're all family here,
in case you need to take a piss.

25:50.625 --> 25:51.875
I'm going to kill you.

25:54.083 --> 25:56.500
Governor, I beg your pardon.

26:00.416 --> 26:02.125
I'll hold onto this for you.

26:03.166 --> 26:04.750
Your attention, please.

26:04.833 --> 26:08.750
We have placed 460 kilos of explosives

26:08.833 --> 26:10.625
on doors, windows,

26:10.708 --> 26:14.500
at every entrance and exit, so in case
anyone tries to escape...

26:14.583 --> 26:15.625
Boom!

26:16.458 --> 26:18.625
They would do so in pieces.

26:19.250 --> 26:22.250
It's not worth it.

26:23.375 --> 26:27.750
We must  all stay here together
for a few days, that's right,

26:28.666 --> 26:30.333
but during all this time,

26:31.625 --> 26:32.625
we will

26:33.250 --> 26:35.250
protect you all.

26:35.750 --> 26:38.250
And you will protect us all.

26:39.375 --> 26:40.208
How wonderful!

26:41.125 --> 26:44.375
And now, whenever you want,
you can take the masks off.

26:47.083 --> 26:48.458
Now!

26:51.125 --> 26:52.000
How's that?

26:52.958 --> 26:53.875
How are you?

26:54.583 --> 26:56.375
Now that we can see each other,

26:57.208 --> 26:59.208
let me introduce you to Mr. Bogotá.

26:59.291 --> 27:01.250
He's going to pick four volunteers.

27:03.125 --> 27:06.666
My name is Bogotá
and I came to do the hard part of the job.

27:07.625 --> 27:10.375
We're going to work in
over 65 degrees Celsius.

27:10.458 --> 27:13.041
It's going to feel like
a fucking crematorium.

27:13.500 --> 27:17.125
We'll be doing shifts
of 12, 14, 16 or 24 hours.

27:18.250 --> 27:19.708
As many as you can handle.

27:20.875 --> 27:22.375
Who's in?

27:33.625 --> 27:34.458
Name!

27:35.375 --> 27:36.208
Agustín.

27:36.833 --> 27:38.791
-Agustín Montero.
-Why are you here?

27:38.875 --> 27:39.708
I was...

27:40.416 --> 27:41.583
exchanging currency.

27:43.291 --> 27:44.291
Step forward.

27:44.375 --> 27:46.791
Congratulations,
you're our first volunteer.

27:47.041 --> 27:47.875
Next.

27:47.958 --> 27:49.875
Miguel Talanilla. From Murcia.

27:49.958 --> 27:52.208
-Okay.
-What do you do, Miguel?

27:52.291 --> 27:54.458
I intern at the Operations
and Systems Department.

27:56.291 --> 27:57.500
IT.

27:58.041 --> 28:00.166
-Unsuitable.
-Unsuitable. Next!

28:01.583 --> 28:02.916
Name. Why are you here?

28:03.791 --> 28:04.625
Alfonso.

28:04.916 --> 28:08.291
I have... I had an appointment
at the Public Debt Department.

28:10.041 --> 28:13.666
Step forward. Congratulations,
you're our second volunteer. Next!

28:13.750 --> 28:15.166
Name. Why are you here?

28:15.250 --> 28:18.000
Amanda. I'm the Governor's secretary.

28:18.333 --> 28:20.333
Unsuitable. Come on, next!

28:20.416 --> 28:21.250
Name!

28:21.916 --> 28:22.916
Matías Caño.

28:23.208 --> 28:24.875
Suitable! Step forward.

28:25.333 --> 28:26.958
-No, ma'am.
-Don't "ma'am" me.

28:27.041 --> 28:28.875
You're our next volunteer.

28:29.583 --> 28:30.875
I'm no volunteer.

28:33.500 --> 28:35.250
Okay. Can you see this finger?

28:35.833 --> 28:38.500
This finger points at the volunteers

28:38.583 --> 28:41.750
and it is pointing
at you over and over again.

28:41.833 --> 28:44.916
So, please, step forward
because you're now a volunteer.

28:45.541 --> 28:47.791
Ma'am, I'm no volunteer.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.166
What was your name?

28:51.250 --> 28:52.125
Matías Caño.

28:52.208 --> 28:53.041
What?

28:53.125 --> 28:54.291
Matías Caño.

28:54.375 --> 28:55.875
Okay, Matías Caño.

28:55.958 --> 28:58.500
You're coming with me right fucking now.

28:58.583 --> 29:00.875
Let's go. Move!

29:06.291 --> 29:07.125
Come on!

29:10.208 --> 29:11.416
Go to the elevator!

29:13.375 --> 29:14.291
Don't move!

29:18.083 --> 29:19.000
Go in!

29:28.083 --> 29:29.208
What was that about?

29:29.541 --> 29:30.541
Are you stupid?

29:31.041 --> 29:33.125
What the fuck was that about?

29:33.208 --> 29:34.500
To seem more credible.

29:34.583 --> 29:37.375
More credible? Do you think
you're fucking Anthony Hopkins now?

29:38.875 --> 29:40.416
I had to act like a hostage, right?

29:40.500 --> 29:43.625
You're joking. From the producers
of "Coming with me right fucking now,"

29:43.708 --> 29:45.666
coming soon to a blacksmith workshop
near you.

29:45.750 --> 29:48.166
I think I did a good job. It went smooth.

29:48.250 --> 29:49.958
I'll slap your face smooth.

29:53.125 --> 29:53.958
Six years!

29:54.041 --> 29:56.958
Six fucking years working with this guy

29:57.041 --> 30:00.291
and six times I've wanted to slam
his head against a wagon.

30:28.833 --> 30:29.833
My dears.

30:31.583 --> 30:33.250
In the next few minutes,

30:35.291 --> 30:36.916
even your balls are at stake.

30:41.583 --> 30:42.416
Sergio!

30:43.916 --> 30:45.083
The CNI has arrived.

31:17.916 --> 31:18.958
Get them bugged.

31:20.583 --> 31:21.916
Colonel Tamayo.

31:22.000 --> 31:22.833
Inspector.

31:23.500 --> 31:25.416
-Time of explosion.
-12:04.

31:25.500 --> 31:28.458
We heard shooting
and they put explosives everywhere.

31:28.541 --> 31:31.000
-How were they detonated?
-We're not sure.

31:31.791 --> 31:34.208
Plastic explosive, RDX. Flawlessly made.

31:34.291 --> 31:35.291
They're bluffing.

31:35.375 --> 31:37.166
It doesn't seem like it.

31:37.250 --> 31:39.541
They're at the front, the roof, inside...

31:39.625 --> 31:42.416
I studied them. They wouldn't blow it up.

31:42.500 --> 31:44.916
Respectfully,
they're capable of anything.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.791
I take a piss and nothing happens.
They're scum.

31:47.875 --> 31:49.375
-Listen to me.
-Please!

31:56.708 --> 31:57.541
Alfonso.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.291
<i>How are you doing?</i>

32:00.375 --> 32:01.916
<i>I'm fucked big time, Luis.</i>

32:02.916 --> 32:03.750
I can't.

32:05.583 --> 32:07.208
I'm sorry. You're in charge.

32:08.208 --> 32:09.250
Don't worry.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.083
Get some rest.

32:14.125 --> 32:14.958
Luis.

32:17.000 --> 32:17.833
Call her.

32:19.583 --> 32:21.958
I sent her to interrogate Aníbal Cortés.

32:24.916 --> 32:25.916
Call her.

32:35.708 --> 32:36.958
Gentlemen,

32:37.041 --> 32:38.500
we know everyone here.

32:38.583 --> 32:41.708
I'm Colonel Tamayo, Intelligence.
I'm in charge here.

32:42.291 --> 32:44.583
First, I want the queen bitch here.

32:44.916 --> 32:46.125
Get me Alicia Sierra.

32:46.916 --> 32:48.375
<i>Get her on the phone now.</i>

32:50.750 --> 32:51.916
Back to work.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.041
Get me Inspector Sierra right now.

32:56.625 --> 32:57.833
It's her.

33:01.500 --> 33:04.250
Inspector Sierra, you've got
a phone call from Colonel Tamayo.

33:10.583 --> 33:11.416
Talk to me.

33:11.500 --> 33:13.166
<i>Alicia, Tamayo here.</i>

33:13.375 --> 33:14.875
<i>Get something out of him?</i>

33:14.958 --> 33:16.708
Nothing that can help us, Luis.

33:19.375 --> 33:21.291
Send him to his mommy,
to fix him some soup.

33:21.875 --> 33:25.541
<i>He's gone limp</i>
<i>from all the drugs and chats.</i>

33:26.041 --> 33:28.125
Put him on a plane
and come with him to Madrid.

33:28.208 --> 33:29.500
You've got work here.

33:30.458 --> 33:32.125
Let me be part of this, Luis.

33:33.666 --> 33:35.708
Tell me you want me
to get the fucking shepherd

33:35.833 --> 33:37.791
and his sheep out of the bank.

33:39.041 --> 33:39.875
Exactly.

33:40.791 --> 33:41.791
Fuck, yeah...

33:42.291 --> 33:44.458
I'm so happy, my water could break!

33:57.166 --> 33:58.833
I feel uneasy...

34:00.250 --> 34:02.083
in front of all this beauty,

34:04.916 --> 34:07.208
but I've got some pretty unpleasant news.

34:12.666 --> 34:14.875
I've been diagnosed with mom's illness.

34:28.250 --> 34:29.083
How long?

34:30.916 --> 34:31.750
Three years.

34:35.291 --> 34:37.958
At the least.
You know how alarmist doctors are.

34:38.041 --> 34:39.500
In the end, it'll be six.

34:40.083 --> 34:41.041
Or seven.

34:42.750 --> 34:44.625
Like a stray cat's life.

34:58.041 --> 34:59.416
Andrés.

35:00.791 --> 35:04.041
We'll call it all off
and find a treatment abroad.

35:04.125 --> 35:05.458
First, there's no cure.

35:06.833 --> 35:09.250
And, secondly, I enjoy stealing much more.

35:09.333 --> 35:13.208
Do you want to risk spending
the time you have left behind bars?

35:13.291 --> 35:16.250
If a painter told you
he had three years left to live,

35:17.541 --> 35:19.083
would you ask him to stop painting?

35:19.166 --> 35:20.208
Andrés, please...

35:20.750 --> 35:21.666
Look.

35:25.125 --> 35:28.500
Would you have told Michelangelo
to stop sculpting his <i>David?</i>

35:29.375 --> 35:31.000
No. Of course not.

35:31.083 --> 35:34.541
You'd have said:<i> "Forza, </i>Michelangelo!

35:35.250 --> 35:37.583
Continue doing your passion."

35:37.666 --> 35:40.166
A painter? A poet? It's the same thing.

35:43.000 --> 35:43.833
"Gentlemen,

35:46.166 --> 35:48.166
continue creating beauty."

35:51.833 --> 35:53.083
And this job, Sergio,

35:55.375 --> 35:57.208
is an apologia for beauty.

35:59.958 --> 36:01.791
It's our masterpiece.

36:04.250 --> 36:06.708
Sixteen minutes...

36:07.291 --> 36:09.875
and 15 seconds.

36:11.250 --> 36:13.000
Sixteen minutes...

36:14.166 --> 36:16.000
and 15 seconds.

36:17.791 --> 36:18.875
That's what it is.

36:20.375 --> 36:22.625
The moment you touch that door,

36:22.708 --> 36:24.708
the vault will be flooded.

36:25.666 --> 36:27.791
Sixteen minutes and 15 seconds.

36:27.958 --> 36:30.041
The time it takes the water
to reach here.

36:33.958 --> 36:35.166
Either we make a hole

36:35.750 --> 36:38.916
and weld the interconnection tube
in that time,

36:39.291 --> 36:40.125
or that's it,

36:40.875 --> 36:42.541
we all end up in prison

36:43.625 --> 36:44.708
for nothing.

36:46.583 --> 36:47.708
For breaking a door.

36:49.625 --> 36:50.625
But that...

36:51.916 --> 36:53.166
that's not...

36:53.916 --> 36:55.333
going to happen to us.

36:56.583 --> 36:59.625
And that's not going to happen
to us because... Bogotá.

37:01.000 --> 37:01.833
What are we?

37:03.041 --> 37:04.041
The fucking best.

37:05.333 --> 37:06.166
What are we?

37:06.791 --> 37:07.875
The fucking best.

37:09.416 --> 37:11.416
No... Not like that.

37:11.500 --> 37:15.166
You can't melt a 14-ton door like that.

37:15.500 --> 37:16.458
What are we?

37:16.541 --> 37:18.000
The fucking best!

37:18.083 --> 37:19.166
What are we?

37:19.250 --> 37:20.750
The fucking best!

37:20.833 --> 37:22.291
What are we?

37:22.375 --> 37:23.458
The fucking best!

37:23.541 --> 37:26.000
That's much better! Grab your lances!

37:27.291 --> 37:29.833
This is not a door.

37:31.333 --> 37:32.750
This is butter.

37:33.833 --> 37:35.000
And you...

37:36.000 --> 37:39.208
You're going to melt it down.

37:39.291 --> 37:42.666
Burnt butter! Take your positions!

37:47.875 --> 37:49.500
Come on, Sergio.

37:50.458 --> 37:52.750
Don't be mean. Imagine it.

37:53.166 --> 37:54.750
Imagine it. You can do it.

37:54.833 --> 37:56.500
Imagine it with me now.

37:59.583 --> 38:02.375
A 14-ton steel door.

38:02.875 --> 38:04.041
And right there,

38:05.041 --> 38:07.458
the best blacksmiths in the world.

38:07.541 --> 38:08.708
Ready?

38:08.791 --> 38:11.791
Tick-tock!

38:11.875 --> 38:12.708
Now!

38:20.208 --> 38:25.250
The moment we touch that door,
water will pour in; 7,500 liters/minute.

38:34.083 --> 38:35.416
Tick-tock!

38:35.500 --> 38:38.000
Come on! Hurry up!

38:38.708 --> 38:40.458
Don't stop!

38:40.750 --> 38:41.875
<i>Once it's full,</i>

38:43.208 --> 38:44.333
you'd be crushed

38:45.083 --> 38:46.500
if you opened that door.

38:47.916 --> 38:49.708
But we're not going to open it.

38:50.500 --> 38:51.833
Exactly.

38:53.666 --> 38:56.000
We're going to penetrate it.

38:57.666 --> 38:58.833
Bring the ram!

38:58.916 --> 39:00.666
Go!

39:10.666 --> 39:11.625
Now!

39:15.791 --> 39:16.833
Tube!

39:16.916 --> 39:19.666
Go! Lead the way!

39:19.750 --> 39:23.875
In the 16 minutes it takes
the vault to fill up, we'll play

39:25.875 --> 39:28.000
Jacques-Yves...

39:28.666 --> 39:29.750
Cousteau.

39:31.250 --> 39:32.250
One, two, three.

39:32.333 --> 39:33.458
Push!

39:43.000 --> 39:43.833
Ready!

39:45.750 --> 39:49.166
Without opening that door,
a welder will go in.

39:50.250 --> 39:51.083
Here.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.291
Okay, we're ready.

39:53.791 --> 39:55.250
Our fate is in your hands.

40:17.250 --> 40:19.416
The oxygen comes first.

40:19.541 --> 40:21.291
-Let me be.
-What are you doing?

40:21.375 --> 40:23.208
-I've got time!
-What the fuck?

40:23.291 --> 40:25.291
Put your oxygen on, Bogotá!

40:25.375 --> 40:28.958
Shit! Why? Why the hell does someone
always have to be the hero?

40:29.041 --> 40:31.750
There's always someone
who has to play the hero!

40:32.166 --> 40:36.083
And right there,
with water rising by the second,

40:36.166 --> 40:39.208
begins the real fantasy
of the new millennium.

40:39.291 --> 40:41.625
Welding a small interconnecting chamber

40:41.708 --> 40:44.208
to both sides.

40:53.625 --> 40:57.375
With water rising by the minute,
it's better than a Bond movie.

40:57.458 --> 41:01.625
Not even James Bond could weld
the antechamber in such a short time.

41:01.708 --> 41:02.541
Exactly!

41:02.625 --> 41:05.958
That's why we'll hire
the best welder in the world.

41:10.791 --> 41:14.791
If the water level is over the welding,
or this welding isn't perfect...

41:20.250 --> 41:22.375
the water will push with such pressure

41:22.458 --> 41:25.125
that we'd need four or five days
to get him out.

41:25.208 --> 41:27.500
So, he'd die!

41:28.833 --> 41:29.666
He'd die!

41:31.375 --> 41:33.708
But what robbery is without risk?

41:34.250 --> 41:36.041
Go!

41:36.125 --> 41:37.291
Don't waste time!

41:46.416 --> 41:49.916
Anyway, brother,
let's not think about that just now.

41:52.750 --> 41:54.750
Come on! Just one more minute!

41:56.166 --> 41:58.166
Just give me one more minute!

42:04.500 --> 42:07.125
Who would imagine that?

42:08.916 --> 42:09.750
Who?

42:20.625 --> 42:21.541
I'm going in.

42:21.625 --> 42:24.791
An interconnecting antechamber.

42:29.291 --> 42:31.208
Just like a bathyscaphe!

42:39.500 --> 42:40.458
So then,

42:41.416 --> 42:45.250
my dearest brother,
there come the bubbles.

42:51.750 --> 42:53.875
You used to love ocean documentaries.

42:53.958 --> 42:56.458
Well, now comes
your most wonderful moment.

42:56.541 --> 42:59.416
As the flotation levels out...

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
Bogotá!

43:11.583 --> 43:12.583
You're alive!

43:15.125 --> 43:16.333
...you turn around...

43:20.041 --> 43:21.666
<i>see the bubbles...</i>

43:24.791 --> 43:25.833
sparkling bubbles,

43:27.333 --> 43:30.000
because of the gold ingots,

43:30.083 --> 43:32.666
and bursting against the roof.

43:45.041 --> 43:47.875
You'll think you're in the Space Station.

43:54.416 --> 43:55.375
But you aren't.

44:05.083 --> 44:08.583
You're in the vault of the Bank of Spain.

44:13.458 --> 44:16.166
There... floating...

44:21.750 --> 44:25.416
It'd be like entering a sunken galleon
in the middle of the ocean.

44:25.541 --> 44:28.125
Ninety tons of 24K pure gold.

44:30.666 --> 44:31.750
What do you think?

44:38.458 --> 44:41.000
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever heard.

44:47.916 --> 44:48.750
I told you!

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
Compay!

45:07.750 --> 45:10.250
<i>Guajira guantanamera</i>

45:12.250 --> 45:15.125
<i>Guantanamera</i>

45:15.208 --> 45:18.875
<i>Guajira guantanamera</i>

45:18.958 --> 45:21.750
<i>Do not leave me in the dark</i>

45:22.958 --> 45:25.291
<i>To die like a traitor</i>

45:26.500 --> 45:28.875
<i>Do not leave me in the dark</i>

45:30.125 --> 45:33.000
<i>To die like a traitor</i>

45:33.875 --> 45:36.625
<i>I am good and good as I am</i>

45:37.708 --> 45:40.166
<i>I will die facing the sun</i>

45:42.500 --> 45:43.875
Facing the sun, brother.

45:44.666 --> 45:46.083
I want to die on a beach.

45:46.375 --> 45:50.833
When the judge comes to pick up my body,
I want him to say: "That bastard!"

45:52.875 --> 45:55.291
<i>Guajira guantanamera</i>

45:55.375 --> 45:56.208
Let's dance.

45:57.250 --> 46:00.125
<i>Guantanamera</i>

46:00.208 --> 46:02.875
<i>Guajira guantanamera</i>

46:02.958 --> 46:04.541
Dance with me.

46:12.166 --> 46:14.375
My babies...

46:15.041 --> 46:16.708
Look what I brought.

46:18.875 --> 46:22.541
Look at these little earrings I've found.
Would you look at that?

46:23.041 --> 46:25.208
Golden! Sweet gold!

46:36.458 --> 46:37.291
That's right!
