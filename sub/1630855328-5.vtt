07:30.645 --> 07:32.180
You should have
downloaded movies, then.

07:32.214 --> 07:34.886
I mean, I also have to go
to the bathroom.

07:34.919 --> 07:37.725
Well, that's not good.
Bathroom on the plane is busted.

07:37.759 --> 07:40.598
-W-What?
-Yeah, but you can use
the emergency can.

07:40.631 --> 07:41.867
Where's the emergency can?

07:41.900 --> 07:43.504
-You're sitting on it.
-What? Wh--

07:43.537 --> 07:45.508
You just pull that cushion up
and, uh, get that

07:45.541 --> 07:47.077
privacy screen over there.

07:47.110 --> 07:48.814
Is it a number one
or a number two?

07:48.847 --> 07:50.751
It's a number one.

07:50.785 --> 07:52.154
Eh, let 'er rip.

07:52.187 --> 07:54.058
It's still gonna go out
in the air anyway.

07:54.091 --> 07:56.095
Are you sure you don't have
any food anywhere?

07:56.128 --> 07:57.899
Why don't you sniff around
back there?

07:57.932 --> 07:59.502
What's this?

07:59.536 --> 08:00.971
-What's that?
-There's a can of something.

08:01.005 --> 08:02.809
Oh, that's an old can of oysters
from another flight.

08:02.842 --> 08:04.979
-A can of oysters?
-Yeah, go ahead, have them.

08:05.013 --> 08:06.650
Ugh, goddamn it.

08:07.384 --> 08:09.188
[Dennis]
All right, all right.

08:09.221 --> 08:10.223
-Getting pretty close here.
-Okay, now,

08:10.256 --> 08:11.660
just go with me here, Dennis.

08:11.693 --> 08:13.029
I want you to picture it,
all right?

08:13.062 --> 08:15.568
It's a whole
lifestyle ecosystem.

08:15.601 --> 08:16.970
-No--
-With booze and suits

08:17.004 --> 08:19.241
and apps that link you
to personal trainers

08:19.274 --> 08:21.178
who make you look good
in the suits. Premium.

08:21.212 --> 08:22.849
-Dude, this is what I'm saying.
-No, listen, can we please,

08:22.882 --> 08:25.253
please, please just
stick with the blend?

08:25.286 --> 08:27.558
-Stick with the blend.
-This is a blend of ideas.

08:27.592 --> 08:28.994
Yes, but it's a blend of
too many ideas. I don't even

08:29.028 --> 08:31.232
know what you're talking about
half the time.

08:31.265 --> 08:32.969
-I'm talking about
branding, bro, it's branding.
-I know what you're--

08:33.002 --> 08:34.071
You know what, actually,
you just keep

08:34.104 --> 08:35.674
your mouth shut the whole time.

08:35.708 --> 08:37.244
Just keep your
mouth shut, I'll do the talking.

08:37.277 --> 08:39.014
We do the firm handshake, right?
'Cause that's essential

08:39.048 --> 08:40.751
to setting tone
for a good pitch.

08:40.785 --> 08:42.588
Got to have a firm handshake.
And then that's it.

08:42.622 --> 08:44.659
I do the talking,
and don't say a goddamn thing

08:44.693 --> 08:46.195
about booze and suits and apps.

08:46.228 --> 08:48.099
-Here we go.
-Oh, okay.

08:48.132 --> 08:49.836
-Thank you.
-Thanks, ladies.
-Thank you so much.

08:49.869 --> 08:51.840
-Uh, all right. Come on, guys.
-[Dennis] All right.

08:51.873 --> 08:53.076
-Okay, here we go.
-Hey, there, fellas.
-Hey.

08:53.109 --> 08:54.879
Hi, uh, hello to you, kind sirs.

08:54.913 --> 08:56.883
-[chuckles]
-Let's do a...

08:56.917 --> 08:59.154
-Oh, uh...
-No.

08:59.188 --> 09:02.260
No, I'm sorry,
we-we don't shake hands. So...

09:02.294 --> 09:04.599
Uh, well, that kind of
throws off my whole thing.

09:04.632 --> 09:06.570
I think-- We can't kick this off
without a firm handshake.

09:06.603 --> 09:08.172
-Why don't you just--
-I really don't mind
shaking his hand.

09:08.206 --> 09:09.876
How many times do we have
to go through this?

09:09.909 --> 09:12.047
-We're not shaking hands.
-We're not shaking hands.

09:12.080 --> 09:13.049
-We don't know these people.
-Don't know you.

09:13.082 --> 09:14.719
-Sorry.
-Oh.

09:14.753 --> 09:15.988
Wow, look at that suit.

09:16.021 --> 09:17.290
-Yeah. Look at that.
-I love that.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.562
I'm not supposed to talk.

09:19.596 --> 09:21.031
-[Dennis] I didn't say--
I didn't say--
-I'm not supposed to, either.

09:21.065 --> 09:23.002
Oh-- Come on,
let's get this going.

09:23.035 --> 09:24.271
-He's-he's kidding.
He's kidding.
-Uh, yeah, so-so...

09:24.304 --> 09:26.108
-He's kidding.
-Oh, yes. He, uh, just...

09:26.142 --> 09:28.112
-Yeah, but--
-Come on, everybody say,
"Dos Hombres."

09:28.146 --> 09:30.116
-Oh, uh...
-[all] Dos Hombres!

09:30.150 --> 09:31.586
-All right, you can get
-Thanks so much.
-Yeah, so, we have a--

09:31.620 --> 09:32.922
the photos with the QR code
that way.

09:32.955 --> 09:34.291
-There you go.
-No, I don't need a photo.

09:34.324 --> 09:35.761
Actually, I-I just
wanted to pitch you--

09:35.795 --> 09:38.600
-I--
-All right, hey. All right.

09:38.634 --> 09:39.869
What just happened?

09:39.903 --> 09:41.172
You blew it, dude.
You choked.

09:41.205 --> 09:43.342
I didn't choke, no.
It was... Malcolm.

09:43.376 --> 09:45.146
He was throwing me a weird vibe.

09:45.180 --> 09:46.950
-Yeah. He's very aggressive.
-He's super aggressive.

09:46.983 --> 09:48.921
He's, like, he's, like
the alpha dog, dude.

09:48.954 --> 09:50.156
-I didn't like that.
-Malcolm's not in the middle.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.060
-He's on top.
-He's on top.

09:52.094 --> 09:53.864
-Shit.
-You know what, let's-let's
get back in the line.

09:55.835 --> 09:57.872
[coughing]

10:01.045 --> 10:03.182
Oh. Hey.

10:03.216 --> 10:04.351
Hey.

10:04.384 --> 10:06.723
Hey, buddy.
[clears throat]

10:07.925 --> 10:09.294
Hey, can I ask you something
really quick?

10:09.328 --> 10:11.232
-Yeah, sure, man. What's up?
-Uh, hey, listen,

10:11.265 --> 10:12.802
I've been throwing up
for a little bit.

10:12.835 --> 10:14.171
Ugh, dude, sorry.

10:14.204 --> 10:15.708
Yeah, I-I actually
kind of can't stop.

10:15.741 --> 10:17.344
I think I'm having
a reaction to the metals.

10:17.377 --> 10:18.947
But, uh, my real problem
is, like,

10:18.981 --> 10:20.951
no matter how much I hurl,
like, the nickels

10:20.985 --> 10:23.189
-keep coming out.
-Nickels?

10:23.222 --> 10:25.160
Oh, yeah, it's a 'schläger play
I got going.

10:25.193 --> 10:26.797
So, hey, look,
can you do me a favor?

10:26.830 --> 10:28.634
On my next hurl,
you know, do you--

10:28.667 --> 10:30.671
could you see if you see any
loose change in there, you know?

10:30.704 --> 10:33.342
'Cause, like, I-I really got to
get a extra set of eyes on this.

10:33.376 --> 10:35.246
-I can't help you. All right?
I-I'm waiting for somebody.
-Please, please.

10:35.280 --> 10:36.683
-Sir, I'm begging you, please.
-It's not happening.

10:36.716 --> 10:39.054
Listen, man,
I can't help, all right?

10:39.087 --> 10:40.223
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!

10:40.256 --> 10:41.392
What the hell?!

10:41.425 --> 10:43.196
-Damn it!
-Oh! Hey.

10:43.229 --> 10:44.666
-Hey, man, hey, hey.
-Come here.

10:44.699 --> 10:45.868
Come here. Look at this.
Look at this.

10:45.901 --> 10:47.337
-Okay. Yes, sir.
-Look at this.

10:47.370 --> 10:48.740
They're gonna ding me
for the cleaning fee.

10:48.774 --> 10:49.843
-All right?
-Ah, yeah, look at that.

10:49.876 --> 10:51.011
Peace and love, peace and love.

10:51.045 --> 10:52.815
-Damn it!
-I'm sorry! Hey, hey.

10:52.849 --> 10:54.384
-Just say by my car.
Stay by my car
-Hey, hey.

10:54.418 --> 10:55.754
-Hey, hey!
-and watch this,
I got to figure this out.

10:55.788 --> 10:57.090
-Get by the car.
-Okay, okay, okay.

10:57.123 --> 10:57.825
I got your car.
I'll watch your car.

10:57.859 --> 10:58.961
Yeah. [coughs]

10:58.994 --> 11:00.998
[grunts] He was a big boy.

11:01.031 --> 11:02.835
-Jesus. [coughing]
-Damn it.

11:02.869 --> 11:04.238
[Charlie groans]

11:04.271 --> 11:06.375
Hey, man, are you
the Dos Hombres driver?

11:06.408 --> 11:08.079
Who?

11:08.112 --> 11:09.682
You know,
the Malcolm in the Middle guys.

11:11.252 --> 11:12.387
Yes, I am.

11:12.420 --> 11:13.924
Come on, come on.

11:15.159 --> 11:16.730
The dad did like my suit.

11:16.763 --> 11:19.001
Would you shut up
about the dad and the suit?

11:19.034 --> 11:20.403
-Thank you very much.
-[Dennis] What are they doing?

11:20.436 --> 11:21.873
-Oh, great. Okay.
-[Dennis] Damn it.

11:21.907 --> 11:23.009
They're wrapping things up.

11:23.042 --> 11:24.779
That's great. We blew it.

11:24.812 --> 11:27.183
We totally blew our one shot.
Goddamn it.

11:27.217 --> 11:29.321
Hey, I think
I just saw Jalen Hurts.

11:29.354 --> 11:30.925
-What? Seriously? Where?
-Yeah.

11:30.958 --> 11:32.160
Dude, he just went
into the bathroom.

11:32.194 --> 11:33.830
I'm sure that was him.

11:33.864 --> 11:35.701
Okay, uh, listen.
We're gonna pivot, all right?

11:35.734 --> 11:37.137
I mean, Jalen's a better fit for
our Philly-based brand anyway,

11:37.170 --> 11:39.174
-don't you think?
-Yeah.

11:39.208 --> 11:40.443
-Let's go talk to Jalen.
-Let's get Jalen.

11:40.476 --> 11:42.147
Come on, let's go.

11:42.180 --> 11:44.284
-[urinating]
-Jalen.
-Yeah,

11:44.318 --> 11:46.055
so, hey, listen, uh,
I know this is a little weird,

11:46.088 --> 11:48.292
us bum-rushing you in the
bathroom like this, but, uh...

11:48.326 --> 11:50.263
You always were good
against the rush.

11:50.296 --> 11:52.033
[laughs] Now, that is true.
You are good against the ru--

11:52.067 --> 11:54.071
Now, you're not gonna get away
from us, though. [laughs]

11:54.104 --> 11:55.908
We gotcha.

11:55.941 --> 11:57.177
That was a joke. Um...

11:57.210 --> 11:59.014
[urinating continuing]

11:59.047 --> 12:01.485
Okay, uh, well, listen, uh,
we-we just, uh,

12:01.519 --> 12:02.955
we wanted to pitch you

12:02.989 --> 12:05.193
a-a really great
business opportunity.

12:05.226 --> 12:06.997
Yes, now imagine this lifestyle:

12:07.030 --> 12:09.067
you're on a Caribbean island
in an ill-fitting suit.

12:09.101 --> 12:11.907
No, no, st-- no, uh, Jalen,
we're not-not here to...

12:11.940 --> 12:13.142
-pitch you a lifestyle.
-[toilet flushes]

12:16.081 --> 12:18.352
-Gritty?
-Wait...

12:18.386 --> 12:20.023
-What the hell is this?
-Wh-- I...

12:20.056 --> 12:21.325
I thought you said Jalen Hurts
came in here.

12:21.358 --> 12:22.929
Is he in one
of the other stalls?

12:22.962 --> 12:25.033
I don't know, I must have
gotten them confused.

12:25.066 --> 12:26.201
How do you confuse
a young Black man

12:26.235 --> 12:27.805
with a giant orange monster?

12:27.838 --> 12:29.374
-Uh...
-[squeak]

12:29.408 --> 12:32.047
Okay, Gritty, picture yourself
on a Caribbean island.

12:32.080 --> 12:34.384
-Don't pitch Gritty! We're here
to talk to a celebrity.
-[toilet flushes]

12:34.418 --> 12:37.090
-Gritty's just Gritty.
-[squeak]

12:37.123 --> 12:40.163
What-- Oh, hey, Jalen! Jalen!
There he is. Jalen!

12:40.196 --> 12:42.334
-Ah, we just missed him.
-What are you talking about?

12:42.367 --> 12:44.338
-That was not Jalen Hurts.
-Yes, it was.

12:44.371 --> 12:46.208
Oh, don't take his side, Gritty.

12:46.241 --> 12:48.479
-Well, he's right.
-That was definitely
Jalen Hurts.

12:48.513 --> 12:49.949
Uh, you know what, Gritty,
we don't need you anymore.

12:49.983 --> 12:51.352
Why don't you take a hike, pal?

12:51.385 --> 12:52.989
-Appreciate it.
-[squeak]

12:53.022 --> 12:54.525
-[phone ringing]
-Goddamn it.

12:54.559 --> 12:56.061
Hold on a second.
Oh, it's Charlie.

12:56.095 --> 12:57.498
What-- Wait, wait, wait.

12:57.531 --> 12:59.234
-What do you want, man?
-[Charlie] Hey, uh,

12:59.267 --> 13:01.372
Dennis, uh, get to Frank
as fast as you can.

13:01.405 --> 13:03.376
I have Malcolm and his dad.

13:03.409 --> 13:05.146
-Are you serious?
-I'll explain later.

13:05.179 --> 13:06.816
Just-- I'll delay them
as long as I can.

13:06.850 --> 13:07.985
[Aaron]
Hey, could you maybe just

13:08.019 --> 13:09.121
not be on the-the phone?

13:09.154 --> 13:10.390
-Yeah? Okay.
-Oh, yeah.

13:10.423 --> 13:11.960
Of course, sir.
Yeah, I got to go.

13:11.993 --> 13:13.396
-Please? Thank you.
-Uh, sorry about that.

13:13.429 --> 13:14.932
-Very unprofessional.
-Thank you very much.

13:14.966 --> 13:16.101
-Uh, apologies.
-Yeah, that's okay.

13:16.135 --> 13:17.370
[sniffs]

13:17.404 --> 13:18.874
Does it smell funky in here?

13:18.907 --> 13:20.376
Very funky.

13:20.410 --> 13:22.548
-Oh, you guys
picking up an aroma?
-Yeah.

13:22.581 --> 13:24.251
-Yeah.
-Yeah, yeah, all right.

13:24.284 --> 13:25.521
You-- There might be a funk
to it, Mr. Malcolm.

13:25.554 --> 13:27.558
I did vomit in here earlier.

13:27.591 --> 13:30.430
Oh, oh, great.
Thank you for that.

13:30.463 --> 13:34.004
Wow. And my name is not
Mr. Malcolm, it's Aaron.

13:34.037 --> 13:35.874
[Charlie]
Okay, I got you. Yeah, yeah.

13:35.908 --> 13:37.177
We can go by whatever code name

13:37.210 --> 13:38.847
you feel most
comfortable with, sir.

13:38.880 --> 13:40.416
You know, I can't imagine
the pressures of being

13:40.450 --> 13:42.320
-a Hollywood celebrity.
-Oh, oh, please, please, please!

13:42.354 --> 13:43.523
-[horn honks]
-Watch the road, watch the road.
-Oh, yeah! Shit!

13:43.557 --> 13:45.861
-Jesus.
-Pardon my language.

13:45.894 --> 13:47.832
Yeah, sorry about that.
Uh, pardon my driving.

13:47.865 --> 13:49.869
I haven't driven a car
in a long, long time.

13:49.902 --> 13:52.307
I-- We really got to start
vetting these drivers.

13:52.340 --> 13:54.545
Okay? If we're driving around
in these crappy town cars

13:54.579 --> 13:56.516
with lunatics
and now we're flying coach?

13:56.549 --> 13:57.585
-Counterpoint.
-Coach?

13:57.618 --> 13:59.589
I do like the grit.

13:59.622 --> 14:01.258
-[Aaron] Oh, my God.
-Don't you?

14:01.291 --> 14:03.162
I mean, it's associating
with the common man.

14:03.195 --> 14:04.464
-Talking about me?
-Yes.

14:04.499 --> 14:06.335
-Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.

14:06.368 --> 14:08.039
-Absolutely.
-When I first stepped
onto the boards

14:08.072 --> 14:10.009
in the Great White Way
of Broadway...

14:10.043 --> 14:13.182
-Oh, and here we go again
about Broadway.
-Was I in the role

14:13.215 --> 14:14.919
-of Richard III? No.
-Were you? No?

14:14.952 --> 14:16.321
-Slipping it in, of course.
-No.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.025
-I was his understudy.
-Okay.

14:18.059 --> 14:19.595
-[groans]
-I never really got
to be on stage.

14:19.629 --> 14:21.198
-Okay.
-But I was very close.

14:21.231 --> 14:23.035
-You had to earn it, huh?
-[laughs]

14:23.069 --> 14:25.440
-You had to earn it.
-It's all about the work,
isn't it?

14:25.473 --> 14:26.576
-See? He's working,
we're working.
-Yeah, right?

14:26.609 --> 14:28.179
Yeah, we're-- We are working.

14:28.212 --> 14:30.617
Now, you can never forget
where you came from.

14:30.651 --> 14:33.022
-Remember how you got here?
Remember, huh?
-Yes.

14:33.055 --> 14:36.061
This clown lost all of his money
playing slots

14:36.095 --> 14:38.600
-at Pechanga. Yeah.
-It-- I-I--

14:38.633 --> 14:40.637
[Aaron]
No, you have a problem.
You know you have a problem.

14:40.671 --> 14:42.942
The first step:
admitting you have a problem.

14:42.975 --> 14:46.115
I admit I am a servant
to the gods of chance.

14:46.148 --> 14:47.450
I pray at their altar.

14:47.484 --> 14:48.954
-Yeah, way too much.
-Come on, baby.

14:48.987 --> 14:49.989
-Way too much.
-Yeah, come on, baby!

14:50.022 --> 14:52.026
[laughs]
Let 'er roll!

14:52.060 --> 14:53.897
-Let 'er rip!
-No, this guy was a week away

14:53.930 --> 14:56.101
from sucking off tourists, okay?

14:56.135 --> 14:58.907
-Oh, my God.
-To pay his rent,
and you know that.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.476
Fellas, you're not gonna
have to suck anyone off.

15:00.511 --> 15:02.948
I'm taking you guys straight
to a private plane today.

15:02.982 --> 15:04.484
-Hmm?
-Oh, great. Finally. See? See?

15:04.519 --> 15:06.523
There you go. Aren't you happy?

15:06.556 --> 15:08.058
-Doesn't that feel nice?
-I'm very happy. Yes.

15:08.092 --> 15:09.662
-[phone ringing]
-[Aaron] Finally. Okay.

15:09.695 --> 15:11.966
Sorry, I happen to be getting
another-another call here.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.402
-I got to take it.
Hello, this is the driver.
-[Aaron] Oh, my...

15:13.436 --> 15:16.241
Hey, Charlie!
You said to call when we landed.

15:16.275 --> 15:18.245
What? We landed?

15:18.279 --> 15:21.218
We landed 20 minutes ago.
I'm just gassing up.

15:21.251 --> 15:23.155
Oh, goddamn it,
why didn't you tell me that?

15:23.189 --> 15:25.226
I wouldn't have eaten
the disgusting oysters.

15:25.259 --> 15:26.529
-Ugh.
-You ate those oysters?

15:26.563 --> 15:28.132
What? You told me to.

15:28.165 --> 15:30.336
That can is from
a shellfish company I started

15:30.369 --> 15:31.973
with Tony Danza
back in the '80s.

15:32.006 --> 15:34.111
Tony's Oysters in a Can-za?

15:34.144 --> 15:36.081
-It was a catchy name.
Didn't go anywhere.
-Goddamn you.

15:36.115 --> 15:37.651
Gross. I am out of here.

15:37.685 --> 15:39.221
-[coughing]
-[Charlie] Frank?

15:39.254 --> 15:40.289
-Charlie.
-Uh, this is Mr. Frank.

15:40.323 --> 15:41.526
He's the owner of the plane.

15:41.559 --> 15:43.295
-Oh, perfect.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:43.329 --> 15:45.501
Uh, yes, Mr. Frank?
I have the father and son.

15:45.534 --> 15:48.540
You got them, Charlie?
Bring them over right away.

15:48.573 --> 15:50.276
All right. Ha, ha!

15:50.309 --> 15:52.715
Charlie got Malcolm and his dad.

15:52.748 --> 15:54.384
-Oh, shit. Are you serious?
-[whoops]

15:54.417 --> 15:56.421
-Oh, I'm staying.
-What are you talking about?

15:56.455 --> 15:58.392
You've been complaining about
getting off the plane.

15:58.425 --> 16:00.096
Now all of a sudden
you're staying?

16:00.129 --> 16:01.699
-[coughs]
-All right. Hey, guys. Come on.

16:01.733 --> 16:03.169
Let's go. Out of the cabin.

16:03.202 --> 16:04.572
What-what--
I'm not leaving my plane.

16:04.605 --> 16:06.408
Oh, no, we've had
this whole situation

16:06.441 --> 16:08.245
where Jalen Hurts felt trapped
and he just freaked out

16:08.279 --> 16:10.283
-and ran away.
-It was not Jalen Hurts, okay?

16:10.316 --> 16:11.686
-It was literally
just some Black guy.
-I-- It was definitely

16:11.719 --> 16:13.289
-Jalen Hurts. Either way,
-It was not Jalen Hurts.

16:13.322 --> 16:14.659
-let's just go. Let's go.
-Let's go. Come on.

16:14.692 --> 16:15.293
-Up, up, up.
-Ugh, all right, all right.

16:24.211 --> 16:25.614
-Yeah.
-[sighs]

16:25.647 --> 16:28.152
Yeah, but I always wonder
at whose expense.

16:28.185 --> 16:30.423
You know,
when I was making my way

16:30.456 --> 16:32.360
on the Great White Way
of Broadway...

16:32.393 --> 16:34.231
-Oh, my God. Jesus-- Hey.
-It was hard.

16:34.264 --> 16:35.767
You know, I-I have an idea.

16:35.801 --> 16:37.671
Why don't you just shut
your eyes and go to sleep?

16:37.705 --> 16:41.011
And then I will let you know
when you can wake up.

16:41.044 --> 16:43.015
-Okay? Shh.
-Okay. Thank you.

16:43.048 --> 16:44.685
Okay.

16:44.719 --> 16:46.556
-Oh, but sleep's for pussies.
-Geez.

16:46.589 --> 16:49.027
Let's party, am I right?
Hey, guys, I'm Dee.

16:49.060 --> 16:50.797
Jesus, where'd you come from?

16:50.831 --> 16:52.735
I didn't know we were
sharing the plane.

16:52.768 --> 16:54.772
-Yeah, I--
-Ah! [laughs]

16:54.805 --> 16:56.676
Hi, I'm Frank, the owner.

16:56.709 --> 16:58.547
And you don't
have to share the plane.

16:58.580 --> 17:02.120
This plane, this
pretty little bird can be yours

17:02.153 --> 17:04.792
for a mere price of $35 mil.

17:04.825 --> 17:06.395
-[Dennis] Sorry, actually, um...
-[Aaron groans]

17:06.428 --> 17:08.299
-It's a beautiful bird.
-Hey, guys, don't worry.

17:08.332 --> 17:09.669
We're not-not here to sell you
a plane. Frank, please, don't.

17:09.702 --> 17:11.639
Yeah, we want to--
We-we'd sell the plane

17:11.673 --> 17:13.442
-We would, but that's
not the point.
-if you would go for it,

17:13.475 --> 17:15.146
-you'd buy it.
-Just-- We're not selling
the plane.

17:15.179 --> 17:16.315
-Okay, we're here
to sell you, um--
-A lifestyle

17:16.348 --> 17:18.052
-No, no.
-and ill-fitting suits.

17:18.085 --> 17:19.589
-No, no, no, uh,
that-that's also wrong.
-[laughs]

17:19.622 --> 17:21.124
-We're not selling
any of that, okay?
-Okay.

17:21.158 --> 17:22.393
-[laughs]
-No, no, no. Let's-let's... No.

17:22.427 --> 17:23.563
We're here to sell you a, uh--

17:23.597 --> 17:25.166
Nickelschläger!

17:25.199 --> 17:26.669
No, goddamn it! None of that.

17:26.703 --> 17:28.272
None of that. Okay,
listen-listen to me. Listen.

17:28.305 --> 17:29.307
-Look, we're just-- Listen.
-He's the driver.

17:29.341 --> 17:30.844
Let's just start over, okay?

17:30.877 --> 17:32.748
We're gonna start all over,
and we're gonna do it

17:32.781 --> 17:34.619
with a firm handshake.

17:35.621 --> 17:37.558
Oh. I'm not supposed to.

17:37.591 --> 17:39.060
-Oh, come on, man.
-[Mac] I think you're in

17:39.094 --> 17:40.429
an abusive relationship.

17:40.463 --> 17:43.335
Okay! This is absolutely insane.

17:43.369 --> 17:44.839
Put your hand down, Bryan.

17:44.872 --> 17:47.176
But I don't mind shaking
his hand, really, I don't--

17:47.210 --> 17:48.580
No, put it down,
you silly little bitch.

17:48.613 --> 17:49.749
Put it down.

17:49.782 --> 17:52.153
-Put it down.
-No.

17:52.186 --> 17:53.523
Don't you touch him.

17:53.556 --> 17:55.661
I said no.

17:55.694 --> 17:58.265
[Aaron]
What? Oh, my God.

17:58.299 --> 17:59.835
What is happening?

18:01.238 --> 18:02.541
Sit down.

18:02.574 --> 18:04.477
Please, just sit down.

18:05.346 --> 18:07.250
-Y
ou want us to sit down?
-Sit down, please,

18:07.283 --> 18:09.287
-all of you.
-We-we will sit down.

18:09.321 --> 18:10.590
[Dennis]
Yeah, why don't we all sit down?

18:10.624 --> 18:13.763
I don't ask for a lot.

18:13.797 --> 18:16.368
An Emmy here, a Tony there.

18:16.401 --> 18:19.341
Little pocket change for
the one-armed succubus in Reno.

18:19.374 --> 18:20.544
But you.

18:21.913 --> 18:24.585
You, you're--
It's never enough for you.

18:24.619 --> 18:26.388
You want it all.

18:26.421 --> 18:28.459
And you deceived me
into thinking

18:28.493 --> 18:30.897
that-that I wanted it all, too,
and I don't.

18:30.931 --> 18:34.237
And you took charge
of our little operation,

18:34.270 --> 18:36.174
and ever since then,

18:36.208 --> 18:40.116
you've been... you've been
controlling my life.

18:42.521 --> 18:45.126
You control everything.

18:47.564 --> 18:48.733
Or do you?

18:51.539 --> 18:53.576
Maybe...

18:53.610 --> 18:56.315
you are the one being deceived.

18:56.348 --> 18:59.622
Maybe being the front man

18:59.655 --> 19:02.260
of an alcohol business

19:02.293 --> 19:05.567
places your head
so far out in front of you

19:05.600 --> 19:08.372
that you don't even realize

19:08.405 --> 19:10.877
that your neck is exposed.

19:10.911 --> 19:13.950
Enough to be lopped off

19:13.983 --> 19:15.721
by a public

19:15.754 --> 19:17.958
so thirsty to taste the blood

19:17.992 --> 19:20.497
of greedy celebrities.

19:22.501 --> 19:24.672
So, when they come--

19:24.705 --> 19:27.176
and they will--

19:27.210 --> 19:29.515
who are they gonna
come after, huh?

19:29.548 --> 19:32.420
The sweet, hapless boob...

19:33.656 --> 19:36.529
...or the slick-talking,
scheming millennial?

19:37.731 --> 19:39.869
[chuckles]

19:39.902 --> 19:42.674
So, I ask you...

19:43.643 --> 19:45.547
...bitch...

19:47.985 --> 19:50.489
...who is really in charge here?

19:50.524 --> 19:52.360
[sniffs]

19:52.393 --> 19:55.332
[sighs]

19:55.366 --> 19:56.903
Boom.

19:56.936 --> 19:59.875
And that, my friends,

19:59.909 --> 20:01.478
is acting.

20:01.512 --> 20:03.449
-[laughs]
-What? Wow!

20:03.482 --> 20:05.754
-What?!
-Wait, wait.

20:05.787 --> 20:07.490
-That was--
-That-that was all fake?

20:07.524 --> 20:09.327
Made it all up.
Fake, fake, fake, fake.

20:09.360 --> 20:10.797
No offense, anything I said.

20:10.831 --> 20:11.833
-Oh, no, you're welcome...
-I was just joking.

20:11.866 --> 20:13.402
But I do love to perform.

20:13.435 --> 20:15.372
-I do, it's in my blood.
-You got the stuff.

20:15.406 --> 20:17.711
Uh, you should consider
doing a drama, Mr. Middle.

20:17.745 --> 20:19.414
-You really should
consider doing drama.
-Yeah.

20:19.447 --> 20:20.851
-That's a good idea.
-I think you got the goods, man.

20:20.884 --> 20:21.886
Hey, so listen,
do you guys want to invest?

20:22.888 --> 20:24.759
-Boss?
-Fuck no.

20:24.792 --> 20:27.463
-Fuck no! No.
-Fuck no!

20:27.498 --> 20:28.666
[Aaron]
Of course not.
I don't want to spend

20:28.700 --> 20:30.302
another moment with you crazies.

20:30.336 --> 20:31.572
-Not another minute.
-You people are insane.

20:31.606 --> 20:33.643
Get me off this plane.

21:09.682 --> 21:12.654
