WEBVTT

00:00.023 --> 00:01.539
Is Mason right?

00:01.609 --> 00:04.375
Is JD Lambert part of this?

00:04.727 --> 00:05.960
Cora, you're gonna have to trust me

00:05.984 --> 00:07.474
if I'm gonna help you.

00:07.580 --> 00:08.979
He was the one I was with

00:09.028 --> 00:11.062
on Fourth of July weekend.

00:11.115 --> 00:13.990
This is Mr. Lambert's lawyer,
Mr. Harding.

00:13.992 --> 00:16.222
So JD brings a gun to a knife fight.

00:16.270 --> 00:17.636
- More like a cannon.
- These cops

00:17.661 --> 00:19.360
don't give a shit about you.

00:19.362 --> 00:21.596
Trust me, all they wanna do
is put you away.

00:21.598 --> 00:23.698
No, no. He's helping me.

00:23.700 --> 00:25.967
I feel like you're not
really interested.

00:25.969 --> 00:28.703
Something could happen to me,
and you wouldn't even notice.

00:28.705 --> 00:30.571
I bought it from his girlfriend,

00:30.573 --> 00:32.177
her prints are all over it,
and I recorded

00:32.202 --> 00:33.541
the whole conversation.

00:33.543 --> 00:35.410
Caitlin, please. You can arrest her

00:35.412 --> 00:37.578
or him or something.

00:37.580 --> 00:38.846
They're hunting us.

00:38.848 --> 00:41.316
I know what you're doing,
so you can just stop.

00:41.318 --> 00:42.650
You want me to die.

00:42.652 --> 00:43.985
There was this wallpaper

00:43.987 --> 00:46.321
like the design on a dollar bill.

00:46.323 --> 00:48.289
It's on every wall.

00:48.291 --> 00:50.358
- It's the school bus again.
- Don't worry about

00:50.360 --> 00:52.936
the school bus,
where did you go with Maddie?

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:37.507 --> 01:39.741
He slept through the night.

01:42.789 --> 01:45.534
I can't believe it.

01:45.815 --> 01:49.284
I know.

01:49.452 --> 01:52.081
Finally.

01:54.724 --> 01:57.693
- Shh, shh.
- You shh.

02:18.648 --> 02:20.919
The remains were unearthed
late last night

02:20.998 --> 02:22.650
and in a stunning development,

02:22.652 --> 02:25.720
are apparently linked to
the Cora Tannetti murder case

02:25.722 --> 02:27.789
that has rocked the Dorchester community

02:27.791 --> 02:29.624
- for the past several weeks.
- <b></b> I can't take this.

02:29.626 --> 02:30.765
Behind me, as you can see,

02:30.820 --> 02:32.971
there is still lots of ongoing activity,

02:32.996 --> 02:34.896
as authorities and forensic specialists

02:34.898 --> 02:36.364
make their way to the crime scene,

02:36.366 --> 02:38.399
which is reportedly miles away

02:38.401 --> 02:40.110
from the nearest road access.

02:40.196 --> 02:41.969
The identity of this individual

02:41.971 --> 02:44.872
is yet to be determined, but
DPD Captain Brian Warren...

02:44.874 --> 02:46.501
Mason? Is that you?

02:46.526 --> 02:48.404
You wanna tell me
what the hell's going on?

02:54.984 --> 02:58.024
You got some serious
voodoo shit going on now, Harry.

03:03.393 --> 03:04.892
Detective.

03:10.867 --> 03:12.667
We're looking at a female,

03:12.804 --> 03:14.869
teenager or young adult.

03:14.871 --> 03:16.771
Been out here three to four years.

03:16.773 --> 03:18.673
No more than ten. We'll be able

03:18.675 --> 03:21.008
to narrow that down after analysis.

03:21.010 --> 03:22.510
Anything on the cause of death?

03:22.512 --> 03:24.045
Nothing jumps out so far,

03:24.047 --> 03:27.081
but she was wrapped
in this blanket here.

03:27.083 --> 03:28.916
They brought her here
from somewhere else.

03:28.965 --> 03:31.799
Could be. These could be
old blood stains.

03:31.801 --> 03:34.903
Might get lucky
and pull some DNA off it.

03:38.241 --> 03:41.124
The questions surrounding
murder defendant Cora Tannetti

03:41.155 --> 03:43.272
have only intensified this morning

03:43.319 --> 03:45.079
with the discovery of a human body

03:45.081 --> 03:47.882
buried deep in the heart of
the Weehawken Forest Preserve.

03:47.884 --> 03:50.395
While authorities have yet to confirm

03:50.420 --> 03:52.459
if Ms. Tannetti is
responsible for this death...

03:58.972 --> 04:00.885
Hey, Mom.

04:09.005 --> 04:11.906
Why didn't you answer any of my calls?

04:11.908 --> 04:14.208
I was busy working.

04:15.245 --> 04:17.011
I found it.

04:17.012 --> 04:20.310
It's 950 a month,
right in the center of Naples.

04:21.017 --> 04:23.217
Can we, um, find something cheaper?

04:23.219 --> 04:25.253
No, no. Look, it's perfect.

04:25.255 --> 04:26.965
Come here.

04:27.891 --> 04:29.557
It's right across the street
from the beach.

04:29.559 --> 04:32.527
I can walk there all by myself, see?

04:35.865 --> 04:37.865
I made another deposit today.

04:37.867 --> 04:40.254
We cracked 3,000.

04:41.426 --> 04:43.148
Another grand, we'll be good to go.

04:45.657 --> 04:49.125
And I got you
another match today.

04:49.252 --> 04:53.848
He's name's Scott, he's 34.
He's a hospital administrator.

04:56.019 --> 04:59.121
He's actually... he's not dumb.
And he looks generous.

04:59.289 --> 05:01.456
And he thinks that you love Dolly Parton

05:01.458 --> 05:03.176
as much as he does.

05:06.997 --> 05:09.150
It's time for your shot.

05:09.833 --> 05:11.899
Draw a bath for your sister.

05:16.510 --> 05:18.604
Dear Heavenly Father,

05:18.742 --> 05:21.392
as we prepare to receive
this healing medication,

05:21.417 --> 05:22.887
we thank you as always.

05:26.210 --> 05:27.522
Okay.

05:27.607 --> 05:29.616
Yeah, I got it.

05:29.853 --> 05:31.285
I got... I got it. Thank you.

05:31.287 --> 05:33.187
Jesus.

05:37.193 --> 05:39.140
Can you explain to me, please,

05:39.295 --> 05:41.500
how in the name of God
did you come up with this?

05:41.631 --> 05:43.101
Mushrooms.

05:44.167 --> 05:45.972
Mushrooms.

05:46.302 --> 05:51.066
A decomposing body
changes the soil chemistry.

05:51.718 --> 05:54.676
Certain plants grow, others don't.
Hence, mushrooms.

05:54.678 --> 05:57.819
That and... soil depression over here.

05:58.351 --> 06:00.163
That's wonderful.

06:00.650 --> 06:03.272
But what the hell were you doing
way out here in the first place?

06:04.220 --> 06:06.119
It's complicated.

06:07.033 --> 06:09.657
Well, you should know
the Staties are right behind me.

06:11.592 --> 06:13.125
How did that happen?

06:13.166 --> 06:15.767
- I got this under control.
- Yeah.

06:16.263 --> 06:18.349
Mushrooms.

06:19.038 --> 06:20.138
Ann.

06:20.302 --> 06:22.248
Brian.

06:22.830 --> 06:24.196
How are you?

06:24.277 --> 06:27.011
- Dan, Jose.
- Nice to meet you guys.

06:33.953 --> 06:35.686
- Cora.
- What's going on?

06:35.688 --> 06:37.121
I'm going crazy waiting for you in here.

06:37.145 --> 06:40.702
Mrs. Tannetti, this is
BCI Captain Ann Farmer,

06:40.727 --> 06:42.426
New York State Police.

06:42.428 --> 06:44.295
She's been assigned to the murder case,

06:44.297 --> 06:46.063
the one that's connected to the body

06:46.065 --> 06:47.932
we found in the woods.

06:47.934 --> 06:50.735
Hi, Mrs. Tannetti,
it's nice to meet you.

06:50.737 --> 06:53.037
Let me get those for you.

06:53.039 --> 06:57.041
Captain Famer and I will be
working on this together.

06:57.043 --> 06:59.677
She's got a couple questions to ask you.

06:59.679 --> 07:02.814
So, I assume.

07:02.816 --> 07:06.260
Detective Ambrose has made you
aware of your rights.

07:06.886 --> 07:08.352
Yes.

07:08.425 --> 07:09.631
Great.

07:10.156 --> 07:12.857
- Can I call you Cora?
- Sure.

07:12.859 --> 07:16.272
 Sorry.

07:16.696 --> 07:18.162
Nanny trouble.

07:19.232 --> 07:21.106
You have kids, right?

07:21.334 --> 07:23.234
- Oone.
- Twins.

07:23.364 --> 07:25.336
It never ends.

07:25.338 --> 07:28.005
Okay, I am putting that away.

07:28.007 --> 07:30.741
So what can you tell me about that body

07:30.743 --> 07:32.777
we found in the woods?

07:37.250 --> 07:38.816
- Nothing.
- You knew something

07:38.818 --> 07:41.429
- was buried out there.
- No.

07:41.788 --> 07:43.437
No, I didn't know.

07:43.829 --> 07:45.539
Um...

07:45.804 --> 07:48.133
I don't understand, um...

07:48.228 --> 07:51.729
How is it that you led Detective Ambrose

07:51.731 --> 07:54.194
to that exact location?

07:55.201 --> 07:58.787
I was, just telling him

07:59.706 --> 08:03.174
bits... of what I remembered.

08:07.046 --> 08:08.846
Remembered of what?

08:11.284 --> 08:13.417
I don't... I... I... I don't know.

08:14.821 --> 08:18.545
Cora, you can see how this doesn't look

08:18.591 --> 08:21.123
- very good for you.
- I didn't do this.

08:22.037 --> 08:23.779
I didn't kill anybody.

08:23.830 --> 08:28.137
Else. You didn't kill anybody else.

08:33.373 --> 08:36.807
Cora Tannetti is already
awaiting sentencing

08:36.808 --> 08:39.143
on the Belmont homicide,

08:39.145 --> 08:43.847
and she led Detective Ambrose
directly to the burial site.

08:43.850 --> 08:45.449
This isn't rocket science.

08:45.451 --> 08:48.252
It's just that
Cora Tannetti weighs 115 pounds.

08:48.254 --> 08:51.222
To me, it seems unlikely
that a woman that size

08:51.224 --> 08:54.959
would haul a body in 3 miles
in from the nearest road

08:55.185 --> 08:56.726
all by herself.

08:56.843 --> 08:58.905
Sounds like you've got
a different take on this.

08:58.998 --> 09:00.936
We're starting to circle a local dealer.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.358
JD Lambert.

09:02.435 --> 09:04.913
Women disappear around this guy.

09:05.048 --> 09:07.832
His ex, Maddie Beecham,

09:07.944 --> 09:09.911
she went missing five years ago.

09:10.230 --> 09:12.153
We're still trying to track her down.

09:12.394 --> 09:14.478
And you think she's our Jane Doe.

09:14.480 --> 09:16.480
- Possibly.
- She fits the timeline.

09:16.482 --> 09:18.549
That said, it could be anyone.

09:18.551 --> 09:21.621
Okay, let's bring in this JD Lambert

09:21.646 --> 09:23.371
and see what he has to say.

09:23.396 --> 09:26.134
Well, we did that. He's not saying much.

09:26.159 --> 09:27.892
He's a slippery guy,

09:28.138 --> 09:30.428
but we're working on some other angles.

09:32.031 --> 09:35.073
Okay, well, bring me
everything you've got on him.

09:35.268 --> 09:38.135
Cora, too. I wanna get up to speed

09:38.137 --> 09:40.134
on all the good work you've been doing.

09:40.497 --> 09:44.485
Thanks, everybody.
Let's keep pushing forward.

09:49.951 --> 09:52.986
I mean, they basically told me
that I'm the guy.

09:52.988 --> 09:56.573
And that means full benefits
and a pay raise.

09:56.759 --> 09:59.259
Which, I'm already doing pretty well.

09:59.261 --> 10:01.776
But now it's like...

10:02.298 --> 10:04.164
I'm gonna buy that condo.

10:06.403 --> 10:08.394
- Congratulations.
- Yeah.

10:08.419 --> 10:11.082
I think it was the coding that I did

10:11.107 --> 10:13.958
for the new payroll system
that did the trick.

10:14.246 --> 10:16.679
You got something stuck in there.

10:16.846 --> 10:19.581
That... a little more to the left.

10:21.595 --> 10:23.675
There's some toothpicks
at the register, you could...

10:23.787 --> 10:25.399
Yeah, good idea.

10:25.488 --> 10:28.047
Um... sorry.

10:43.807 --> 10:45.206
All better.

10:48.812 --> 10:52.005
You know, I should... I should
probably be getting back.

10:52.382 --> 10:55.350
Really?

10:56.920 --> 11:00.361
Um, but it's... it's so early.

11:00.775 --> 11:04.692
Can I... can I take you
for some ice cream or something?

11:29.953 --> 11:32.996
We're packing up here,
unless you need anything else.

11:33.657 --> 11:35.324
I'm good.

13:13.323 --> 13:15.890
Most of our members
don't hunt these days.

13:15.892 --> 13:18.493
But the Beverwyck
still owns about 3,000 acres

13:18.495 --> 13:21.829
of old growth forest preserve
since the 1850s.

13:21.831 --> 13:25.095
And that back road that I came in on,

13:25.435 --> 13:26.801
who has access to that?

13:26.803 --> 13:28.469
Only club members and grounds crew.

13:28.517 --> 13:30.515
The front gate is locked at all times.

13:30.540 --> 13:33.674
I'm going to need
a member list, a staff list,

13:33.676 --> 13:37.588
and anybody who's had access
for going back ten years, say.

13:37.647 --> 13:39.815
I'm sorry, and what is this regarding?

13:39.949 --> 13:42.674
It's a murder investigation.

13:43.086 --> 13:45.647
Um... let... let me see what I can do.

13:45.855 --> 13:47.772
Thanks.

14:47.884 --> 14:49.550
Well, it's good news.

14:49.552 --> 14:52.523
The State Police and the DA
offered us a deal.

14:52.655 --> 14:54.155
If you provide a detailed confession

14:54.180 --> 14:55.867
to the second murder, they'll let you

14:55.892 --> 14:57.892
serve the two sentences concurrently

14:57.894 --> 15:00.061
and guarantee early parole at 20 years,

15:00.063 --> 15:01.866
pending good behavior.

15:02.765 --> 15:04.565
- 20 years.
- Yeah, we're down

15:04.567 --> 15:06.567
from 30 years
with the first murder charge.

15:06.569 --> 15:09.003
This is better
than anything we could hope for.

15:11.407 --> 15:14.575
Cora, the thing is,
if you reject the offer,

15:14.577 --> 15:17.417
and down the road they convict
you on this other murder,

15:17.747 --> 15:21.229
they will prosecute you to
the fullest extent of the law.

15:21.684 --> 15:23.517
That's backtoback life sentences.

15:23.681 --> 15:26.754
Possibility of parole in 80 years.

15:29.654 --> 15:33.689
So I'm supposed to confess
to a murder I didn't commit.

15:34.130 --> 15:37.354
All I can tell you is you
won't be getting a better deal.

15:37.800 --> 15:40.393
And it won't be on the table forever.

15:44.931 --> 15:48.867
The Beverwyck Club started
accepting Jews in 1978

15:48.869 --> 15:50.532
blacks in '85.

15:50.587 --> 15:52.361
Besides that, they keep a low profile.

15:52.424 --> 15:55.692
Not a single police report filed
in the last 15 years.

15:55.694 --> 15:57.994
- What's this?
- An employee filed

15:57.996 --> 16:00.597
a wrongful dismissal suit
a few years back.

16:00.599 --> 16:02.747
That's the... that's the only
recent article I could find.

16:02.771 --> 16:04.012
It's something.

16:04.059 --> 16:06.089
Here you go. This way.

16:10.342 --> 16:12.609
I'll start going through this. Thanks.

16:12.611 --> 16:14.611
- Have a good day.
- Okay. Thanks.

16:14.613 --> 16:16.760
Captain.

16:17.716 --> 16:20.502
Whatever Mason Tannetti
might've told you,

16:20.652 --> 16:23.053
I think it'd be good if we
didn't make a move

16:23.117 --> 16:25.109
on JD Lambert just yet.

16:25.257 --> 16:28.491
It's good to have him out in the field

16:28.493 --> 16:31.109
with his guard down,
not stuck in County.

16:31.173 --> 16:33.373
I'll consider that, Lieutenant. Thanks.

16:33.398 --> 16:35.350
Thank you.

16:35.576 --> 16:37.267
- By the way...
- Yeah.

16:37.269 --> 16:39.069
I was just catching up
on your interviews

16:39.071 --> 16:41.271
with Cora Tannetti,
and I noticed that you logged in

16:41.273 --> 16:43.387
to see her a couple times at County...

16:43.466 --> 16:45.633
after hours.

16:45.677 --> 16:47.711
I'm not seeing any of those transcripts.

16:47.762 --> 16:49.559
Because those were informal.

16:50.082 --> 16:51.833
I was just chasing down the details.

16:52.117 --> 16:54.288
Nothing checked out.

16:54.686 --> 16:56.786
Normally, I like to keep a record

16:56.788 --> 16:59.546
of all interactions with a defendant,

16:59.691 --> 17:01.116
no matter how small.

17:01.288 --> 17:03.296
It's an old habit, but...

17:03.629 --> 17:05.733
saved my neck a few times, so...

17:06.098 --> 17:07.991
Makes sense.

17:20.078 --> 17:21.936
Welcome back.

17:23.115 --> 17:26.082
We were just about to
close our eyes for a minute.

17:26.107 --> 17:27.840
You wanna join?

17:28.420 --> 17:30.755
You don't have to do anything.

17:31.297 --> 17:33.637
Or say anything.

17:38.697 --> 17:41.019
There we go.

17:45.570 --> 17:49.102
God, I wanna thank you

17:49.441 --> 17:52.828
for protecting all the women
inside these walls.

17:53.345 --> 17:58.548
Take away from us all
fear, anxiety, stress.

18:01.453 --> 18:03.386
Are you coming?

18:03.531 --> 18:05.755
God, thank you
for protecting our families

18:05.757 --> 18:07.768
while we are incarcerated,

18:07.843 --> 18:10.694
allowing them to fix their eye on you...

18:12.271 --> 18:14.464
And allow them to hope for the future.

18:17.836 --> 18:20.714
A hope found in Christ.

18:46.398 --> 18:48.298
How'd you get all the way down there?

18:50.535 --> 18:53.269
- Amen.
- Amen.

19:14.359 --> 19:16.538
Cynthia Burrows?

19:16.862 --> 19:19.428
I'm Detective Ambrose.

19:19.464 --> 19:21.749
I'm with Dorchester Police.

19:21.867 --> 19:24.501
You filed a wrongful termination suit

19:24.503 --> 19:27.474
against the Beverwyck Club.
Isn't that right?

19:27.906 --> 19:29.472
I'm not allowed to talk about that.

19:29.497 --> 19:31.052
Why not?

19:31.374 --> 19:33.372
It was part of the settlement.

19:33.845 --> 19:36.966
Well, we could make this off the record.

19:37.315 --> 19:38.915
It doesn't matter.

19:39.185 --> 19:43.720
Ms. Burrows, we found
the remains of a young woman

19:43.834 --> 19:45.993
buried in the woods behind Beverwyck.

19:47.325 --> 19:49.384
Anything you could tell us...

19:50.829 --> 19:53.363
we would really appreciate it.

19:54.633 --> 19:56.499
<b></b> Jesus.

19:57.936 --> 19:59.502
<b></b> Out there.

20:04.242 --> 20:07.105
I was, working late.

20:07.279 --> 20:08.808
Some kind of fundraiser.

20:08.914 --> 20:11.323
Table of guys kept buying drinks.

20:11.416 --> 20:13.730
I had one.

20:13.919 --> 20:16.206
I blacked out.

20:16.421 --> 20:18.101
Like...

20:18.390 --> 20:20.367
totally out.

20:20.792 --> 20:22.570
The next day, I...

20:22.861 --> 20:26.297
woke up in a WalMart parking lot...

20:27.207 --> 20:29.973
sitting in the passenger seat
of my own car.

20:31.462 --> 20:33.228
I was totally naked.

20:37.342 --> 20:40.855
Anyway, they fired me the next week.

21:05.917 --> 21:07.323
I'm gonna talk to that guy,

21:07.347 --> 21:09.269
see if we can get
those cameras installed.

21:09.270 --> 21:11.582
<b></b> This is insane.

21:11.840 --> 21:14.608
Even from behind bars,
she's torturing us.

21:14.610 --> 21:16.057
Ma, here... I'll do it, please.

21:16.082 --> 21:18.386
No, I got it.
You know, your father and I

21:18.411 --> 21:21.446
have been talking,
and we think it's a good idea

21:21.471 --> 21:23.817
if maybe we left town.

21:23.819 --> 21:26.932
For... for Laine's sake and for yours.

21:27.022 --> 21:28.205
What are you talking about?

21:28.268 --> 21:30.173
She's killing our business, Mason.

21:30.198 --> 21:31.705
We've lost five accounts already.

21:31.761 --> 21:33.494
Our friends aren't even calling us.

21:33.496 --> 21:35.663
I'm not going anywhere.
Neither is Laine.

21:35.665 --> 21:38.382
Can you just please go inside
before I lose it?

21:54.251 --> 21:56.593
It's...<b></b>

21:56.786 --> 21:58.820
been pretty busy at work,

21:58.989 --> 22:02.671
but I'm trying not to
put any stress on Faye.

22:03.593 --> 22:05.485
Yeah, it's been...

22:06.129 --> 22:07.844
good.

22:08.064 --> 22:10.204
I think.

22:11.167 --> 22:13.446
Thank you, Harry.

22:14.504 --> 22:18.072
Faye, you had something
you wanted to say to Harry.

22:23.179 --> 22:25.219
What?

22:26.049 --> 22:29.651
I think it was a mistake
for you to move back in.

22:31.855 --> 22:33.828
What do you mean?

22:34.057 --> 22:35.664
I mean

22:36.136 --> 22:38.418
I've realized...

22:39.095 --> 22:41.562
I don't wanna do this anymore.

22:46.069 --> 22:48.622
I don't understand.

22:49.306 --> 22:51.997
I thought things would be different.

22:54.210 --> 22:58.380
Even when we're together,
I still feel alone.

22:59.716 --> 23:01.233
I'm sorry.

23:02.451 --> 23:04.819
But we've been doing fine, I...

23:11.027 --> 23:12.894
What did I do?

23:14.731 --> 23:16.685
I need you to move out.

23:18.134 --> 23:22.236
Harry, do you have anything
you'd like to say?

23:35.118 --> 23:36.851
Hey.

23:36.853 --> 23:38.252
You all right?

23:38.922 --> 23:40.655
- Yeah, I'm good.
- You sure?

23:40.657 --> 23:43.257
Hey. Just the man I wanna see.

23:43.859 --> 23:45.860
What's this I hear about you

23:46.187 --> 23:47.829
poking around the Beverwyck?

23:48.234 --> 23:50.932
Bruce here, he's been telling me
how you bulldozed in there

23:50.934 --> 23:53.067
like the Goddamn Swamp Thing.

23:53.069 --> 23:55.770
The lot backs onto the crime scene.

23:55.772 --> 23:58.895
I don't quite get what
you have to do with all this.

23:58.920 --> 24:00.208
I represent the club.

24:00.210 --> 24:04.384
- It's good to see you.
- You have quite the roster.

24:04.409 --> 24:07.025
JD Lambert and the Beverwyck.

24:07.050 --> 24:10.385
Now, what are the odds of that?

24:11.721 --> 24:13.254
Brian, I'll see you later, yeah?

24:13.256 --> 24:14.789
- Yeah, take care.
- Thanks for your time.

24:14.791 --> 24:16.090
Yeah, you say hi to Courtney

24:16.092 --> 24:17.725
- for me, would you?
- Will do.

24:23.800 --> 24:26.034
See the ring? He's married.

24:26.036 --> 24:28.813
That's why he wants to meet
somewhere discreet.

24:29.239 --> 24:32.618
1,000 bucks just to meet up.
No strings attached.

24:34.844 --> 24:37.014
He looks creepy.

24:38.181 --> 24:39.981
So get the money up front.

24:40.006 --> 24:41.505
You don't like him, walk away.

24:42.419 --> 24:44.152
And if you do like him,

24:44.154 --> 24:46.819
then we got ourselves a sugar daddy.

24:52.695 --> 24:54.428
Cora.

24:56.666 --> 24:58.972
Cora, come on, please, we're...

24:59.269 --> 25:01.738
we're so close.

25:03.640 --> 25:05.949
I can't take it here much longer.

25:21.224 --> 25:23.172
You're so pretty.

25:23.660 --> 25:26.219
- It's not fair.
- Stop it.

25:26.763 --> 25:28.439
Sorry.

25:37.941 --> 25:39.974
You know I'd be lost without you.

25:39.976 --> 25:42.043
Dead already.

25:42.045 --> 25:44.654
- Don't say that.
- It's true.

25:44.881 --> 25:47.904
You're the only reason
that this is worth it.

25:48.892 --> 25:50.415
Any of it.

26:08.011 --> 26:09.544
Let me see your hands!

26:09.569 --> 26:10.769
Police! Let me see your hands!

26:13.584 --> 26:15.243
What are you doing?
Get your hands off me.

26:15.245 --> 26:16.632
- Put your hands behind your back.
- My baby's upstairs!

26:16.656 --> 26:18.813
- Come on, let's go.
- I can't leave him here!

26:18.815 --> 26:20.263
Please, let me take him.

26:20.288 --> 26:22.183
No, he can't be left alone, please.

26:22.185 --> 26:25.052
Let me take my baby, please.
Let me take him.

26:27.157 --> 26:30.424
She's not talking.
Says the drugs were hers.

26:30.426 --> 26:32.686
We should've waited on this.

26:33.096 --> 26:35.840
Now we've ruined our shot at JD.

26:36.069 --> 26:38.787
It was a dead end
before it even started.

26:39.068 --> 26:41.104
I talked to Lopez.

26:41.304 --> 26:45.473
What's this about you offering
a deal to Cora Tannetti?

26:45.475 --> 26:47.842
Seems a little early, doesn't it,

26:47.844 --> 26:49.618
to try to pin the Jane Doe on her?

26:49.643 --> 26:51.412
We don't have a cause of death yet.

26:51.414 --> 26:53.414
It's not early if I get her confession.

26:53.416 --> 26:55.950
That sounds like coercion.

26:59.055 --> 27:03.472
You know, I wasn't
gonna say anything, but...

27:04.227 --> 27:07.800
I wonder if maybe you're
a little too close on this.

27:08.464 --> 27:10.316
Too close.

27:10.801 --> 27:13.692
Secret meetings in back of County.

27:13.870 --> 27:16.482
You do that with
all your defendants or...

27:16.973 --> 27:19.880
just the ones
that look like Cora Tannetti?

27:36.652 --> 27:38.452
Why'd you walk in here?

27:38.528 --> 27:40.012
I told you not to.

27:40.403 --> 27:42.739
I'll never tell.

27:47.837 --> 27:49.170
It's your fault.

27:49.195 --> 27:51.644
You make me do things.

27:51.668 --> 27:53.941
Stop...

27:53.943 --> 27:54.943
Stop!

28:04.821 --> 28:06.821
What's the matter?

28:38.649 --> 28:40.716
- Hello?
- Hi.

28:41.487 --> 28:43.096
Hey.

28:43.764 --> 28:46.098
How are you... holding up?

28:46.100 --> 28:48.034
I don't know.

28:49.070 --> 28:52.891
My lawyer thinks I should take
the deal they're offering and...

28:55.309 --> 28:58.538
- I think maybe I should, too.
- No, don't.

28:58.571 --> 29:00.212
Don't make any moves right now.

29:00.214 --> 29:02.015
I... I might have a lead.

29:02.093 --> 29:03.993
Wait, you found something?

29:03.995 --> 29:06.862
I can't say right now,
'cause they monitor your calls.

29:06.864 --> 29:09.844
But just... can you hang in there
for a few days? Okay?

29:09.997 --> 29:11.130
Okay.

29:15.039 --> 29:17.539
So you wanna talk for a while?

29:21.479 --> 29:23.012
Okay.

29:24.415 --> 29:27.979
I'd tell her everything,
and she'd wanna hear it.

29:28.352 --> 29:30.338
Everything I did, who I talked to.

29:30.398 --> 29:32.658
Yeah, she was never bored.

29:33.291 --> 29:36.057
That's a virtue. Never to be bored.

29:36.260 --> 29:38.233
How about you?

29:38.329 --> 29:40.545
Any siblings?

29:41.966 --> 29:44.498
I'm an only child.

29:45.102 --> 29:46.502
Was that lonely?

29:46.504 --> 29:48.716
I don't know.

29:48.935 --> 29:51.185
I spent a lot of time in the woods.

29:51.442 --> 29:53.412
That helped.

29:53.611 --> 29:56.211
Yeah, I can imagine
you happy in the woods.

29:56.213 --> 30:00.037
Just to stay quiet,
watch the birds, just...

30:00.384 --> 30:03.560
listen to the wind... it's good.

30:04.255 --> 30:08.257
Just trying to understand
what Phoebe must have felt like.

30:10.461 --> 30:12.543
Spending her whole life in a tiny room.

30:12.630 --> 30:16.098
Cora, you're not gonna
be in there forever.

30:16.100 --> 30:17.466
You know, I want you...

30:17.468 --> 30:18.734
You are out of prepaid minutes.

30:18.879 --> 30:21.403
Please refill your card.

30:31.248 --> 30:33.506
We didn't order any AC unit.

30:33.707 --> 30:35.684
You sure? That you?

30:35.686 --> 30:37.720
That's our address, but we did not order

30:37.722 --> 30:40.037
an AC unit, I promise you.

30:41.325 --> 30:43.914
Okay, sorry to trouble you.

30:44.014 --> 30:45.814
- Have a good day.
- You too.

30:47.531 --> 30:49.485
Damn kids.

31:09.587 --> 31:12.054
Would you admit to a crime
you didn't commit

31:12.056 --> 31:14.185
just to get a better deal?

31:15.017 --> 31:16.763
Don't ask me.

31:17.150 --> 31:20.162
This is between you and the Big Man.

31:21.548 --> 31:23.715
I grew up with God in my house.

31:23.834 --> 31:26.058
All he brought was more pain.

31:27.244 --> 31:29.908
Then you were talking to the wrong God.

31:30.174 --> 31:31.909
That's all.

31:34.361 --> 31:36.328
Let me tell you something.

31:37.214 --> 31:39.696
I used to wake up every day,

31:40.159 --> 31:42.290
bang meth in my arm,

31:42.553 --> 31:45.480
and decide which old lady's
identity to steal.

31:47.049 --> 31:49.416
I didn't give a shit about anyone.

31:50.738 --> 31:54.347
But once everything I had was gone...

31:55.295 --> 31:57.695
that's when I could hear His voice,

31:57.768 --> 31:59.989
right there, in my ear.

32:00.956 --> 32:02.903
What did he say?

32:03.541 --> 32:06.494
He said stop beating yourself up.

32:06.853 --> 32:09.689
Confess your sins.

32:10.481 --> 32:12.247
Surrender.

32:27.208 --> 32:29.207
Anastasia?

32:30.134 --> 32:32.230
You're Anastasia, right?

32:32.621 --> 32:35.004
- No, ssorry.
- Yeah, you are.

32:35.289 --> 32:36.996
Hey.

32:37.225 --> 32:39.870
Hey! I came a long way for this.

32:40.010 --> 32:41.909
- Leave me alone!
- Don't you want your money?

32:41.934 --> 32:43.737
Hey! Hey!

32:43.831 --> 32:45.588
What the hell you doing, man?

32:45.733 --> 32:48.135
Yeah, walk. Walk!

32:48.176 --> 32:50.443
Are you all right? You okay?

32:54.442 --> 32:56.475
Is this what you're looking for?

32:59.580 --> 33:02.810
Is it Anastasia? Is that your real name?

33:03.651 --> 33:05.651
- It's Cora.
- Cora.

33:05.787 --> 33:07.998
I like that better.

33:08.456 --> 33:10.222
I'm James.

33:12.093 --> 33:15.317
Do you need a ride anywhere, Cora?

33:27.508 --> 33:29.575
That's your last one.

33:53.734 --> 33:55.734
Come on, we don't have to
talk to anyone.

34:05.899 --> 34:09.601
I just ring people up
at the register, mostly, and...

34:10.685 --> 34:12.202
restock the shelves.

34:12.286 --> 34:14.420
What would you rather be doing?

34:18.735 --> 34:22.098
- I don't know.
- If you could do anything...

34:23.864 --> 34:25.614
Well, my... my parents need me at home.

34:25.666 --> 34:27.777
Screw your parents. What about you?

34:34.853 --> 34:37.543
There's this thing
you have in your eyes.

34:38.513 --> 34:40.746
I can just see it when I look at you.

34:41.782 --> 34:44.217
You have this spirit.

34:44.452 --> 34:46.670
It's not like anyone else.

34:48.088 --> 34:50.788
You're a force. You realize that?

34:51.583 --> 34:54.150
You could be anything you want.

34:55.830 --> 34:58.394
You should be asking for the world.

35:11.379 --> 35:13.479
Take this off. I wanna see.

35:13.481 --> 35:16.763
I've... I've never done this before.

35:19.787 --> 35:21.513
Ever.

35:26.894 --> 35:29.675
Where did you come from?

35:32.867 --> 35:34.900
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

35:34.902 --> 35:36.916
You're incredible.

36:01.814 --> 36:03.743
- My God.
- Shh, shh, shh.

36:03.830 --> 36:06.431
My God. <b></b>

36:10.147 --> 36:11.603
Shh. It's okay.

36:11.660 --> 36:14.149
It's all my fault. It's all my fault.

36:14.173 --> 36:16.751
- It's all my fault.
- It's not your fault, sweetheart.

36:16.766 --> 36:19.679
- Shh.
- It's okay.

36:19.869 --> 36:22.913
My God! My God,
we thought you were dead.

36:22.960 --> 36:24.660
Shh, Phoebe, it's all right.

36:24.662 --> 36:27.618
Wait. Where were you?

36:28.065 --> 36:29.860
You whore.

36:30.001 --> 36:32.544
Look what you did to your sister.

36:32.703 --> 36:34.255
Just look!

36:36.240 --> 36:38.427
Look, Cora.

36:40.678 --> 36:42.169
Look.

36:42.413 --> 36:46.083
I told you, I don't remember.

36:46.262 --> 36:50.420
Cora, you were in love with JD.

36:50.503 --> 36:52.619
You were obsessed with him.

36:52.865 --> 36:54.862
And he used you.

36:55.092 --> 36:56.815
Didn't he?

36:57.061 --> 36:59.120
That's okay.

36:59.563 --> 37:01.626
I know how it feels.

37:01.966 --> 37:05.993
These men, they just screw you
and toss you aside.

37:06.303 --> 37:10.399
JD left you and he went back
to his real girlfriend, Maddie.

37:10.485 --> 37:15.179
You had every right to be angry.
I know I would be.

37:15.379 --> 37:17.937
He was your first
real boyfriend, wasn't he?

37:18.082 --> 37:20.749
You would have done anything for him.

37:33.939 --> 37:37.273
Guilt is a brutal thing.

37:37.378 --> 37:39.874
It chews people up.

37:41.238 --> 37:44.409
I see it all the time.

37:45.242 --> 37:47.710
And I can see it in you.

37:48.857 --> 37:52.625
You must be exhausted,
carrying all of that around.

37:52.783 --> 37:55.317
Aren't you exhausted?

37:57.633 --> 37:59.133
Yeah.

38:00.012 --> 38:02.357
What do you feel so guilty about?

38:05.429 --> 38:07.347
Everything.

38:15.106 --> 38:19.689
Then you have to admit
that it's possible...

38:24.148 --> 38:27.649
It's possible that you killed Maddie

38:27.735 --> 38:30.680
and you just... you don't remember.

38:31.088 --> 38:32.899
Isn't it?

38:35.593 --> 38:37.426
Isn't it, Cora?

38:37.428 --> 38:40.129
- Yeah. It is.
- It's possible.

38:40.243 --> 38:42.664
You did kill Frankie,
after all, didn't you?

38:42.666 --> 38:45.954
You couldn't control yourself,
but you did.

38:46.070 --> 38:47.836
 You killed him.

39:07.825 --> 39:09.880
Detective Ambrose.

39:10.060 --> 39:12.044
I'm afraid if you don't have a warrant,

39:12.069 --> 39:14.114
then we really should
take this upstairs.

39:14.475 --> 39:16.408
You know what? If I were you,

39:16.433 --> 39:19.241
I would be thinking...

39:20.504 --> 39:22.631
Of Laine.

39:23.616 --> 39:27.576
20 years, that's a long time,
but it is not forever.

39:32.216 --> 39:37.224
He'll be, what, he'll be 23, 24...

39:37.421 --> 39:40.130
When you get out on parole?

39:41.192 --> 39:45.049
You wanna see him graduate
from college, don't you?

39:45.982 --> 39:47.275
Yeah.

39:48.566 --> 39:50.642
Tell me what happened,

39:51.769 --> 39:54.134
and all of this'll be over.

40:08.652 --> 40:10.929
Go to hell.

40:26.737 --> 40:28.517
- Where you going?
- It's okay.

40:28.572 --> 40:31.150
You get some rest, all right?
I'll be back.

40:52.863 --> 40:55.430
So, Cora Tannetti's hanging tough.

40:55.432 --> 40:57.466
- More than you thought?
- It doesn't matter.

40:57.468 --> 41:00.224
I don't need a confession after all.

41:00.371 --> 41:02.871
We got a DNA match
on those blood stains.

41:02.873 --> 41:05.579
Yeah? Who?

41:06.377 --> 41:08.383
Your girl Cora.

41:11.949 --> 41:14.366
She's all over that blanket.
