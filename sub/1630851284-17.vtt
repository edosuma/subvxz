04:32.498 --> 04:35.274
don't try to save anyone
or anything.

04:35.501 --> 04:37.851
Please, please,

on lost causes is never wasted.

05:02.361 --> 05:03.468

05:03.695 --> 05:05.470

the world's foremost
Bleeding Gums Murphy expert.

05:25.734 --> 05:27.642
I'm still working on that name.

05:27.703 --> 05:28.827
But I can tell you

05:29.054 --> 05:31.496
he would not want
his incredible music

05:31.723 --> 05:35.575
used for this carnival of greed
known as the lottery.

05:35.727 --> 05:40.263
-Little girl, you claim to know
everything about Mr. Murphy.
-I do.

05:40.265 --> 05:43.324
-Do you even know
his first name?
-Oscar.

05:43.344 --> 05:46.403
-Do you know his favorite key?
-B-flat.

05:46.572 --> 05:49.348
Mm, that's right.
Favorite brand of reed?

05:49.499 --> 05:50.423
Légère.

05:50.517 --> 05:51.925
Favorite type of jazz?

05:52.001 --> 05:53.410
-Straight-ahead.
-Huh.

05:53.428 --> 05:55.412
Do you know the name
of his first recording?

05:55.430 --> 05:59.006
Well, his first album
was<i> Broken Elevator Blues.</i>

05:59.026 --> 06:02.027
-Yes...
-But his first recording

06:02.254 --> 06:03.695
was at Minton's Playhouse

06:03.922 --> 06:06.089
playing
alongside Thelonious Monk

06:06.182 --> 06:08.533
when Bleeding Gums was 16.

06:08.726 --> 06:09.926

06:10.095 --> 06:13.096

She'll know this.

06:13.189 --> 06:15.949

06:16.101 --> 06:17.100

06:17.193 --> 06:18.451
-(buzzer buzzes)
-(gasps)

06:18.545 --> 06:20.194
I did not know that.

06:20.214 --> 06:22.122
No further questions,
Your Honor.

06:22.274 --> 06:24.290
But this isn't a courtroom.

06:24.367 --> 06:26.200
Overruled.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.220
-We'll be right back.
-(musical sting plays)

06:33.877 --> 06:35.042

06:35.062 --> 06:36.469
How could I love someone so much

06:36.563 --> 06:39.472
and not know something
so important about him?

06:39.566 --> 06:41.048
Don't worry, Lisa.

06:41.068 --> 06:44.127
-To me, you're perfect.
-I am?

06:44.220 --> 06:46.646
Yes. But I'm just an image
created by your mind,

06:46.740 --> 06:48.648
so I say what you want.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.409
Oh, that's pleasant.

06:50.594 --> 06:53.078
Come on, Lis.
Let's play Target Lisa.

06:53.229 --> 06:55.305
Sorry, I'm too sad.

06:55.323 --> 06:58.308
I can barely play
the soulless sounds of Kenny G.

06:58.326 --> 06:59.993
No one likes Kenny G.

07:00.145 --> 07:02.479
That's why they killed
Kenny A through F.

07:02.497 --> 07:05.257
I didn't even know
my hero had a son. (sniffles)

07:05.408 --> 07:08.593
Watching you cry
makes me feel the need to act.

07:11.080 --> 07:13.581
Ah, much better.

07:13.675 --> 07:15.434
I'm gonna find your son.

07:15.661 --> 07:17.102
And I'm gonna find out
what he thinks

07:17.253 --> 07:19.438
about the way
your songs are being used.

07:19.665 --> 07:23.833
Well, here's a clue. I named him
after my favorite piano player.

07:23.852 --> 07:26.427
Monk. M-Monk Murphy.

07:26.521 --> 07:27.279
That's right.

07:27.430 --> 07:28.930
Now that you've got the name,

07:29.024 --> 07:29.948
just check the phone book.

07:30.099 --> 07:31.766
What's a phone book?

07:31.785 --> 07:34.453
I<i> have</i> been dead a long time.

07:37.106 --> 07:38.698
Hi. I'm Lisa Simpson.

07:38.850 --> 07:40.274
And you're Monk Murphy.

07:40.294 --> 07:42.443
Oh, my God.
You look just like your father.

07:42.612 --> 07:43.703
Let me guess.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.206
You're one of the musicians
my dad mentored.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.858
Do you want to come in
and see pictures of him?

07:48.993 --> 07:50.469
Well, I don't want to impose
on your time.

07:50.696 --> 07:53.454
-Okay.
-Oh, yes!
Please, please, please.

07:53.474 --> 07:56.123
Let me just tell you,
I loved your dad.

07:56.143 --> 07:59.719
For a blues musician,
he could really cheer people up.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.981
Just thinking about him
makes me smile. (chuckles)

08:03.208 --> 08:06.392
And I found out
he recorded a song just for you.

08:06.545 --> 08:08.302
"Monk's New Tune."

08:08.322 --> 08:12.716

08:23.228 --> 08:25.745
I do. But I can't enjoy music

08:25.897 --> 08:28.064
because I can't hear it.
Never could.

08:28.066 --> 08:30.083
I was born profoundly deaf.

we were talking,

08:32.254 --> 08:34.846

-I read lips.

I'm your dad's biggest fan.

08:37.518 --> 08:40.243
(chuckles) Did you love him

08:40.336 --> 08:41.928
Yes. He was a great dad.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.731
He even refereed
my soccer games.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.420
-(Lisa exhales)
-You know,

08:50.438 --> 08:52.680
his whole world
was music and me.

08:52.774 --> 08:54.515
So he took it kind of hard

08:54.609 --> 08:57.327
when he found out
that I couldn't hear.

09:05.028 --> 09:07.212
(clanging loudly)

09:20.561 --> 09:22.619
This boy's hearing loss
is so profound,

09:22.712 --> 09:25.063
you could fire a gun
right next to his head,

09:25.290 --> 09:26.306
and he wouldn't hear it.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.974
That's not how you tested him,
is it?

09:28.068 --> 09:29.484
Of course not.

09:30.720 --> 09:32.629
There have been
great advancements, though.

09:32.647 --> 09:33.905
With a cochlear implant

09:34.132 --> 09:36.074
combined with auditory
and language therapy,

09:36.301 --> 09:37.892
he could potentially
hear quite well.

09:37.986 --> 09:41.062
But I have to warn you, like
any important medical miracle,

09:41.081 --> 09:42.396
it's only for rich people

09:42.416 --> 09:44.916
and doctors
who get a huge discount.

09:45.026 --> 09:47.068
(laughs)

09:47.145 --> 09:49.403
Son,
I'm gonna work night and day

09:49.497 --> 09:51.256
to get you
that cochlear implant.

09:51.483 --> 09:54.909
Uh, do you have any other skills
besides playing jazz?

09:54.928 --> 09:57.095
I also teach jazz.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.914
Uh, how are you paying
for this appointment?

10:00.041 --> 10:01.558
With this.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.162
Looks like about $16.

10:06.255 --> 10:09.090
Yeah. I had a good month.

10:09.184 --> 10:11.109
Wow. That must be
when your father wrote

10:11.260 --> 10:13.427
"Sixteen Bucks
Just Ain't Enough."

10:13.447 --> 10:16.005
Do you still want to get
the cochlear implant?

10:16.099 --> 10:17.841
I do. Very much.

10:18.009 --> 10:19.692
But I take after my dad.

10:19.845 --> 10:23.270
He played jazz for a living.
I run a nonprofit.

10:23.290 --> 10:26.607
I make a lot more than he did
but not enough.

10:26.701 --> 10:29.628
Wait. Did you know
they're using your dad's song

10:29.855 --> 10:31.354
for the Springfield Lottery?

10:31.523 --> 10:33.873
Oh, my God. What?
But he hated gambling.

10:33.950 --> 10:35.967
I know. Did he tell you that?

10:36.194 --> 10:38.711
Uh, no.
I learned it on the website,

10:38.864 --> 10:40.530
Bleeding Gummy Bears.

10:40.623 --> 10:43.975
(chuckles):
Yes! Finally nailed the title.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.293
But the lottery
must be giving you money.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.388
Enough for the implant. Right?

10:48.464 --> 10:51.207
Nope. I'm afraid
I haven't gotten any money.

10:51.226 --> 10:54.301
I'm sorry, what?
I was destined to find you.

10:54.396 --> 10:56.713
My new mission in life
is to make you happy.

10:56.806 --> 10:58.231
You're my new cause.

10:58.383 --> 11:00.158
Hold up.
I'm not anybody's cause.

11:00.385 --> 11:03.310
I enjoy who I am.
I love my community.

11:03.330 --> 11:06.906
And, you know, sometimes I like
turning off annoying sounds

11:07.058 --> 11:08.558
by just closing my eyes.

11:08.727 --> 11:10.727
Oh, yes. I hate annoying noises.

11:10.745 --> 11:13.396
Now just listen.
Here's what we're gonna do.

11:13.489 --> 11:17.008
We're gonna bring
those publishers to their knees.

11:17.160 --> 11:18.301
You and I are g...

11:19.921 --> 11:21.388
...gonna lawyer up, and I...

11:23.016 --> 11:25.558
Then, eventually,
the Supreme Court will hear...

11:27.245 --> 11:29.187
...going to restore
your dad's legacy.

11:29.414 --> 11:32.248
Now? I have to eat.
I have a blood sugar thing.

11:32.267 --> 11:36.027
It's so much easier if you
don't work against me here.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.938
It's cool. They know me here.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.181
(coughs)

11:40.200 --> 11:41.591
(raspy voice):
Mind if I open this window?

11:41.684 --> 11:44.093
This place has windows?

11:44.112 --> 11:46.187
(coughs)
I'm home.

11:46.206 --> 11:49.190
Ooh, they put up
a memorial wall.

11:49.284 --> 11:51.692
That's McCoy Tyner.
He played with Coltrane.

11:51.712 --> 11:54.379
Gerald Wilson,
the west coast Duke Ellington.

11:54.530 --> 11:57.198
And look, Sarah Vaughan.
(gasps)

11:57.366 --> 11:59.959
Oh, no. Etta Pryor passed?

12:00.111 --> 12:01.553
No, baby, I didn't.

12:01.780 --> 12:04.889
I am not gonna lean
against this wall anymore.

12:05.116 --> 12:07.726
Now scat. (chuckles)
No, no, no. Baby, please.

12:07.877 --> 12:09.635
Not that kind of scatting.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.730
(scatting)

12:13.900 --> 12:16.125
We just wanted some information
about my dad.

12:16.219 --> 12:17.794
Monk Murphy?
(chuckles)

12:17.887 --> 12:21.147
Your dad used to bring you here
when you was just a baby.

12:21.224 --> 12:23.649
You know,
I wrote so many songs about you.

12:23.744 --> 12:26.393
Like, uh, um, um, "Please Change
the Baby's Diaper."

12:26.488 --> 12:28.747
"That Baby Spit Up
on My Good Dress."

12:28.898 --> 12:30.749
And "Who Brings a Baby
to a Jazz Club?"

12:30.900 --> 12:32.250
Now, that was a smash hit.

12:32.401 --> 12:34.160
Oh, it's so good
to see you again.

12:34.312 --> 12:36.813
No one
knew your dad better than me.

12:36.831 --> 12:38.906
I knew him better than his mama,

12:38.925 --> 12:41.426
his preacher and his supplier

12:41.577 --> 12:43.336
at the Sunglass Hut.

12:43.488 --> 12:45.321
Great. Who owns the rights
to his music?

12:45.340 --> 12:48.157
I don't know.
But I do know this.

it'll ruin all my hard work

"Your dad saved me once
when I was really sad.

19:10.041 --> 19:11.298
"So when I found out
you existed,

19:11.392 --> 19:12.799
"even before I met you,

19:12.968 --> 19:16.045
"I thought saving you somehow
was what I was meant to do.

19:16.063 --> 19:18.138
"Now I know
the right thing to do

19:18.232 --> 19:20.140
"would have been
to just listen to you

19:20.234 --> 19:23.569
when you said you didn't need
or want saving."

19:23.646 --> 19:26.813
Awesome. And guess what?
I'm getting the implant.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.148
(gasps)
That's wonderful.

19:28.168 --> 19:30.075
How did you get the money?

19:30.228 --> 19:32.395
I finished ninth in the lottery.

19:32.413 --> 19:35.898
"Get in it to win it,
it just takes a minute."

19:35.917 --> 19:37.917
Ugh. Forget I asked.

19:38.069 --> 19:40.569
Okay, I'm about to activate
the device.

19:40.663 --> 19:42.421
This is gonna be so great.

19:42.573 --> 19:44.515
I've picked
something very special

19:44.667 --> 19:48.227

you'll ever hear.

19:52.083 --> 19:52.932
(groans)

19:53.026 --> 19:54.859
Screw you, Bart!

19:55.086 --> 19:57.028
"Screw you, Bart"? I heard that.

19:57.255 --> 19:59.271
Wow. Beautiful.

19:59.424 --> 20:03.092
Woo-hoo! A forgotten prank
made me the center of attention.

20:03.185 --> 20:05.852
Oh, no, no, that's not it.

20:05.872 --> 20:08.855
