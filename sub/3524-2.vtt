01:45.805 --> 01:47.432
Who's a big boy?

02:01.087 --> 02:02.748
Lilac Personal Shopping.

02:02.989 --> 02:04.251
Hey, you.

02:04.424 --> 02:07.518
My cousin came through
on those day-spa certificates.

02:07.727 --> 02:10.752
Excellent. How's outside Daffy's, at 11:00?

02:11.097 --> 02:12.325
Perfect.

02:16.936 --> 02:19.928
You want some lunch?
I was just gonna sit down to a tuna san.

02:20.006 --> 02:23.533
- Onions, in the morning?
- Actually, it's 2:00.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.838
I'm going out by the pool.

02:30.884 --> 02:32.249
What, Mom?

02:33.386 --> 02:35.980
You were gonna get up at 8:30
to be at TCBY Yogurt...

02:36.055 --> 02:38.148
when the manager got there.

02:38.324 --> 02:41.452
It's, like, five days till school starts.
Why get a job now?

02:41.528 --> 02:44.258
I don't know.
A few textbooks you could buy.

02:44.330 --> 02:47.458
Pairs of socks.
Anything that we don't have to supply.

02:47.534 --> 02:50.401
This thing about working
between now and start of classes...

02:50.470 --> 02:54.065
is about you being pissed 'cause
I didn't intern at the Paper Mill Playhouse.

02:54.140 --> 02:57.598
We bought you a car so you could
drive back and forth to your internship.

02:57.677 --> 03:00.168
You don't feel bad
that you didn't live up to the deal?

03:00.246 --> 03:02.544
Jesus, we've been through this
how many times?

03:02.615 --> 03:05.812
There was no stagecraft
in what they had me doing at the Playhouse.

03:05.885 --> 03:08.649
Xeroxing does not count
towards a drama minor internship.

03:08.721 --> 03:11.246
Did you call the drama department,
check that out?

03:11.324 --> 03:14.225
I didn't, so can we shitcan
the courtroom theatrics?

03:14.294 --> 03:15.454
Watch your mouth.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.723
Like I haven't been through
enough this year.

03:17.797 --> 03:20.960
12 credits, 2 semesters in a row,
and I'm not entitled to a summer?

03:21.034 --> 03:22.433
You hardly...

03:23.903 --> 03:25.029
Hello?

03:26.239 --> 03:27.729
Are you kidding?

03:29.075 --> 03:30.975
Listen, can I call you back?

03:34.214 --> 03:37.877
You hardly broke a C, Meadow,
your entire second semester.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.976
Maybe you forgot my ex-boyfriend died?

03:40.053 --> 03:43.545
Your grades were going down
while you were still going out with Jackie.

03:43.623 --> 03:44.715
Great.

03:45.258 --> 03:47.522
Jesus, did you ever lose a friend at my age?

03:47.594 --> 03:49.789
Did you ever have to grieve
when you were 19?

03:49.862 --> 03:53.127
Honey, you should've been working
this summer...

03:53.199 --> 03:54.530
to feel good about yourself...

03:54.601 --> 03:57.661
get your mind off Jackie,
instead of laying out by that pool.

03:57.737 --> 04:01.195
I read, Mom, out by that pool.
Probably half the canon.

04:01.541 --> 04:03.975
"The canon. " Okay, what is that, now?

04:05.812 --> 04:06.938
"Now"?

04:07.880 --> 04:12.180
The great books? Western literature?
Dead white males?

04:12.619 --> 04:14.052
Who even in their reductionism...

04:14.120 --> 04:17.555
have quite interesting things to say
about death and loss.

04:17.624 --> 04:19.853
Maybe more interesting
than what you have to say.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.860
Is Mary Higgins Clark a part of that group?

04:21.928 --> 04:25.489
'Cause that's what I saw you reading
every time I passed by the pool.

04:26.199 --> 04:28.133
Hello?

04:28.601 --> 04:30.626
You're not surprised, are you?

04:31.204 --> 04:33.798
Come on, he's so totally duplicitous.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.873
He had the nerve to come to the pub-crawl?

04:38.745 --> 04:40.508
Can I call you back?

04:41.714 --> 04:42.874
Are we done talking?

04:42.949 --> 04:45.179
Did you go on-line
and register for your classes?

04:45.251 --> 04:47.151
- I will.
- Just go.

04:50.923 --> 04:53.585
There's some guy in your driveway
with a ponytail.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.321
What is his story?

04:57.096 --> 04:59.792
- Hi, Mrs. Sop'.
- Hello, Misty.

05:11.644 --> 05:14.044
Fur', hi. He'll be down in a second.

05:14.113 --> 05:17.514
He's just changing.
He was working outside this morning.

05:19.018 --> 05:21.509
- Do you want some coffee?
- Sure.

05:24.057 --> 05:26.116
I'm gonna buy a house, you know?

05:26.192 --> 05:28.387
- I didn't. Where?
- Nutley.

05:28.628 --> 05:31.756
So you're gonna stay?
You gonna become a citizen, too?

05:31.831 --> 05:33.628
You don't need that.

05:34.100 --> 05:37.661
- How's it going, Ton'?
- Here at Peaceful Acres? Just swell.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.596
I don't got time for coffee.

05:39.672 --> 05:42.300
Drop me off at the mechanic's,
so I can pick up my car.

05:42.375 --> 05:45.742
Then I got an appointment,
and I'll drive myself, all right?

05:45.812 --> 05:46.972
Later.

05:47.180 --> 05:51.139
- Say goodbye to Mead' for me.
- Why don't you say goodbye yourself?

05:56.122 --> 05:59.717
I'll tell you what a gold mine is,
those Harry Potter books.

05:59.792 --> 06:03.751
That's 'cause it gives the other kids,
the 98-pound weaklings, some hope.

06:04.063 --> 06:05.826
Speaking of 98 pounds...

06:05.898 --> 06:09.664
I hear Ginny Sack's getting a 95-pound mole
taken off her ass.

06:10.503 --> 06:12.494
That's some guy's wife, come on!

06:15.308 --> 06:17.469
All right, gentlemen, I got to go.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.609
- Talk to Patsy.
- Happy birthday.

06:21.848 --> 06:23.475
- All right.
- So long.

06:23.816 --> 06:25.807
- See you, guys.
- See you, Ton'.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.614
Happy birthday, Al.

06:33.459 --> 06:36.121
I understand
we got some business to discuss.

06:36.996 --> 06:38.486
The floor is yours.

06:39.198 --> 06:40.756
Go on, tell him.

06:42.668 --> 06:45.330
I drove out to Youngstown
to see Uncle Paulie...

06:45.405 --> 06:47.600
and he was, I don't know...

06:47.907 --> 06:50.034
hoping you could
settle this shit with Ralph...

06:50.109 --> 06:52.339
and the no-show carpenter jobs.

06:52.745 --> 06:53.734
Ralph.

06:54.547 --> 06:58.950
Okay, for the record,
I had my guy go over the books.

06:59.786 --> 07:03.847
We can do maybe two carpenter jobs,
one no-show, one no-work.

07:04.023 --> 07:07.686
Two jobs. On a $300 million project?

07:08.428 --> 07:11.488
Come on. What's the real number?

07:12.899 --> 07:17.131
What? Am I speaking in tongues, here?
Two. Maybe I can do three.

07:17.570 --> 07:21.028
- My uncle's looking for at least 10.
- I'm talking, here.

07:21.707 --> 07:23.265
The guy's in the can.

07:24.477 --> 07:27.310
You think you want
to keep him happy, maybe?

07:27.547 --> 07:29.879
All right. Here it is.

07:30.483 --> 07:32.212
And this comes from...

07:34.120 --> 07:38.250
For the duration,
you will give Paulie five carpenter jobs...

07:39.125 --> 07:41.855
two no-shows and three no-works.

07:42.929 --> 07:46.126
One of the no-shows,
our friend in Youngstown keeps...

07:46.432 --> 07:48.832
and one, he gives to Chrissy here.

07:49.135 --> 07:52.070
The others, the no-work jobs,
that's for Paulie...

07:52.138 --> 07:54.470
how he wants to distribute them.

07:55.741 --> 07:57.368
It is so decreed.

07:57.743 --> 08:01.440
- Now, if there isn't anything else?
- There is something else.

08:02.081 --> 08:05.915
With Paulie in the can,
there's a new acting capo of his crew.

08:08.287 --> 08:09.618
It's Chrissy.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.858
That's the way certain people want it...

08:14.927 --> 08:17.623
and we trust there will be no ill will.

08:19.499 --> 08:23.196
This is fucking great! I mean,
I know I'm just the acting, but still...

08:23.269 --> 08:25.430
It's a big responsibility.

08:25.872 --> 08:27.339
I got it covered.

08:27.406 --> 08:30.671
First thing I'm doing
is getting wings in my hair.

08:32.044 --> 08:33.909
You know, like Paulie.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.347
I'll talk to you later.

08:50.463 --> 08:52.693
See these crystal paperweights?

08:52.765 --> 08:55.256
Last year, I bought the Christmas gifts...

08:55.334 --> 08:57.029
for the entire Jets front office.

08:57.103 --> 08:59.901
Over 600 of these, shaped like footballs.

09:00.673 --> 09:03.574
- You ever get tickets?
- Lost the account.

09:04.877 --> 09:06.469
To better times.

09:11.284 --> 09:14.981
That's so adorable,
with the animals shaped like letters.

09:15.688 --> 09:19.089
- I know. If I ever have a baby...
- Yeah.

09:22.929 --> 09:24.954
- What?
- Nothing.

09:26.899 --> 09:30.096
Christopher talks about having kids,
once in a while.

09:30.202 --> 09:31.669
I don't know.

09:31.971 --> 09:36.067
- Where is our angry young man?
- Out with his friends, I guess.

09:37.043 --> 09:39.238
I used to date this one guy, Vinnie.

09:39.312 --> 09:43.112
He was more like a fuck buddy,
but he lived on Staten Island.

09:43.416 --> 09:47.785
I swear, we'd be in the middle of doing it,
and if his goddamn beeper went off...

09:48.554 --> 09:50.351
then he'd just leave.

09:50.957 --> 09:53.858
I think he was, like,
connected, or something.

09:55.561 --> 09:57.461
He used to carry a gun.

10:01.167 --> 10:03.226
It was probably just to protect himself.

10:03.302 --> 10:05.395
I mean Christopher does, too, sometimes.

10:05.471 --> 10:09.305
- When you're in a cash business...
- Stocks is a cash business?

10:13.045 --> 10:15.013
Can I tell you something?

10:16.449 --> 10:17.438
Sure.

10:31.063 --> 10:33.293
I don't think I can have kids.

10:34.533 --> 10:36.194
What? Why?

10:36.902 --> 10:39.336
I can't believe I'm telling you this.

10:39.705 --> 10:42.299
It's just that I feel really close to you.

10:43.242 --> 10:46.075
A long time ago, before Christopher even...

10:46.545 --> 10:48.137
I had an abortion.

10:48.848 --> 10:50.907
I didn't want to. I know it was wrong...

10:50.983 --> 10:54.817
but the guy was such an asshole,
it was really the best thing.

10:55.554 --> 10:57.954
Anyway, there were complications.

10:59.759 --> 11:02.319
My gynecologist says
that there's a good chance...

11:02.395 --> 11:04.886
I won't be able to hold a pregnancy.

11:09.568 --> 11:12.435
Oh, God, I can't believe I'm telling you this.

11:13.406 --> 11:16.569
Christopher don't even know.
My own mother even.

11:16.842 --> 11:18.935
Sometimes it helps to talk.

11:21.614 --> 11:24.583
They can do incredible things
these days, Ade.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.276
When the time comes...

11:26.352 --> 11:29.753
I know a great ob-gyn
that my sister went to in the city.

11:31.257 --> 11:32.485
Really?

11:34.727 --> 11:38.458
You just show up without calling?
I thought you were going out.

11:39.665 --> 11:41.792
I'm a man of many mysteries.

11:42.935 --> 11:45.460
Danielle, this is Christopher's friend,
Paulie Germani.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.005
Hey, how you doing?

11:49.041 --> 11:52.704
You put this in the back of your freezer,
it'll take out any odors.

11:53.979 --> 11:57.039
Go on, buy her a drink somewheres.
I got to talk to my fiancée.

11:57.116 --> 11:59.880
- Some manners?
- I'll call you tomorrow.

12:00.886 --> 12:03.218
So what? You from around here?

12:05.291 --> 12:06.883
Something's wrong with that broad.

12:06.959 --> 12:09.359
- Something's wrong with you.
- Oh, yeah?

12:09.862 --> 12:11.921
Here's what's wrong with me.

12:16.368 --> 12:18.063
Holy shit!

12:20.539 --> 12:22.268
Oh, my God.

12:23.342 --> 12:26.709
- These diamonds...
- Harry Winston, baby.

12:27.079 --> 12:29.673
It's got more carats than Bugs Bunny.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.888
I had a great conversation with Silvio today.

12:36.956 --> 12:38.446
What? Tell me.

12:39.692 --> 12:43.526
Let's just say that Carmela
ain't gonna be First Lady forever.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.896
<i>Political disagreement is often a catalyst...</i>

12:47.967 --> 12:50.401
<i>Leading to violence in a world gone mad.</i>

12:50.469 --> 12:54.098
<i>Burning rage in Korea spilled onto the street
with deadly results.</i>

12:54.173 --> 12:57.006
Check it out. Guy in the red jacket?

12:57.409 --> 12:59.707
In 10 seconds, that cop's a fucking fireball.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.043
I don't think I want to see this.

13:03.249 --> 13:04.238
Janice!

13:04.750 --> 13:06.377
Fuck, it's my brother.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.614
I'm coming.

13:18.230 --> 13:19.561
What are you doing here?

13:19.632 --> 13:22.624
I was nearby, at Bacala's.
Figured I'd come by, say hello.

13:22.701 --> 13:23.895
Good.

13:24.403 --> 13:26.701
- How's he doing?
- He's fat.

13:29.275 --> 13:30.936
<i>Faces of Death?</i>

13:31.243 --> 13:33.268
<i>What? Was The Sound of Music
already rented?</i>

13:33.345 --> 13:35.438
It's research for our Christian rock video...

13:35.514 --> 13:37.778
I'm coordinating with the record release.

13:37.850 --> 13:40.318
That Tommy Mottola,
he's one slow motherfucker.

13:40.386 --> 13:44.015
- What's it been, about a year?
- Actually, we are not going with Sony.

13:44.089 --> 13:47.081
We're considering
a smaller, independent label.

13:47.626 --> 13:48.957
Naturally.

13:49.461 --> 13:50.951
Got any coffee?

13:51.997 --> 13:53.965
I may only have soymilk.

14:01.140 --> 14:02.129
What?

14:13.152 --> 14:14.983
What do you care?

14:15.221 --> 14:18.713
- It's none of your business, anyhow.
- Ralph Cifaretto?

14:18.924 --> 14:20.789
It's always fucking something with you.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.522
Why don't you stay out
of other people's living rooms?

14:23.596 --> 14:25.063
Jesus Christ.

14:45.718 --> 14:48.278
You look good. Better than last time.

14:55.494 --> 14:57.985
Ralph came through with those jobs.

14:59.164 --> 15:02.190
- What did Tony say?
- It was Tony made him do it.

15:04.236 --> 15:07.137
I wished Albert "happy birthday" for you.

15:07.439 --> 15:09.430
Who's been to see my ma?

15:10.476 --> 15:12.410
I don't think anybody, Paulie.

15:13.846 --> 15:17.111
Chrissy says
Tony sent her some chocolates.

15:17.716 --> 15:21.982
Chrissy said T made a killing
in real estate, down Frelinghuysen.

15:22.154 --> 15:24.748
That assemblyman guy hyped him to it.

15:26.959 --> 15:29.359
Ralph told this funny fucking joke, though...

15:29.428 --> 15:31.157
at Albert's party.

15:31.897 --> 15:32.886
He goes:

15:32.965 --> 15:36.594
"Ginny Sack had a 95-pound mole...

15:36.869 --> 15:39.099
"surgically taken off her ass. "

15:39.538 --> 15:41.199
- He said that?
- Yeah.

15:41.273 --> 15:43.264
And you think it's funny?

15:44.510 --> 15:46.307
It's in bad taste?

16:07.099 --> 16:08.088
The fuck?

16:11.737 --> 16:14.365
That's not what I want.

16:14.740 --> 16:19.109
I want 50 T's, 50 reverse, got that?

16:21.547 --> 16:22.639
Guys.

16:23.382 --> 16:25.509
Pick up those ice-cream wrappers.

16:30.289 --> 16:32.757
<i>If I were a carpenter</i>

16:33.158 --> 16:35.126
<i>and you were a douche bag</i>

16:35.194 --> 16:36.525
What are you doing?

16:36.595 --> 16:39.291
Breaking my balls, what's it look like?

16:39.665 --> 16:41.724
I tell you, this no-show shit is tough.

16:41.800 --> 16:45.759
Deciding what not to wear to work,
what not to put in my lunchbox...

16:45.838 --> 16:47.829
You're breaking my heart.

16:47.973 --> 16:50.806
You should try sitting here 10:30 to 3:00.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.239
You got Carson Avenue?

16:56.515 --> 16:59.211
You know that girl the other night?
Danielle?

16:59.318 --> 17:01.616
She's a piece of ass, but fucking rude.

17:01.687 --> 17:02.711
It's all here?

17:02.788 --> 17:04.221
You remember to put the spores in there?

17:06.425 --> 17:08.051
That's not funny.

17:09.627 --> 17:11.492
What the fuck's all that?

17:11.663 --> 17:14.962
Fiber-optic cable.
High-speed Internet access.

17:17.002 --> 17:18.992
Lot of money in this shit.

17:25.377 --> 17:29.006
The kid was supposed to get a job
this summer, an internship.

17:29.081 --> 17:31.481
Then it wasn't right
for what she was studying. Okay.

17:31.550 --> 17:33.074
That's one down.

17:33.218 --> 17:37.245
Then she was gonna be a hostess
at Artie Bucco's restaurant. I got her that.

17:37.456 --> 17:40.220
Then she couldn't work
Tuesdays and Thursdays...

17:40.292 --> 17:44.092
'cause of her baby-sitting commitment,
and Artie didn't try to understand...

17:44.163 --> 17:45.323
so she left.

17:45.397 --> 17:48.855
Then the baby-sitting family
disappeared to Nantucket.

17:49.001 --> 17:52.437
Then something else fell through,
and then...

17:53.272 --> 17:54.796
So, she's regressing.

17:54.873 --> 17:57.273
She keeps it up, she'll be back in the womb.

17:57.342 --> 17:59.435
Over the course of a child's life...

17:59.511 --> 18:02.571
there's a constant moving away
and coming back.

18:03.282 --> 18:05.250
Security versus freedom.

18:05.617 --> 18:09.212
But what I find interesting,
and that's if I hear you right...

18:09.288 --> 18:11.347
is that at the age of 19...

18:11.957 --> 18:14.653
she actually wants to stay close to home.

18:15.027 --> 18:17.393
See, that's what I was gonna say.

18:17.796 --> 18:20.731
- She did have someone close die.
- Jackie.

18:20.866 --> 18:25.064
But she brings that up whenever you ask
her to clean up after herself, or whatever.

18:25.137 --> 18:27.037
That she's traumatized.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.903
He was shot to death.

18:29.374 --> 18:31.501
It's tragic, that kid.

18:33.212 --> 18:35.942
It was some kind of drug deal, you said.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.447
Exactly, all the earmarks.

18:43.589 --> 18:45.580
It's gotta be tough.

18:48.260 --> 18:51.423
Then again, they'd been broken up,
and he wasn't very nice to her.

18:51.497 --> 18:53.727
It may be a manipulation, in part.

18:53.799 --> 18:57.098
She's got a hard-on about Columbia.
"It's so competitive. "

18:57.369 --> 19:01.965
But it doesn't mean
that her pain over Jackie's death isn't real.

19:04.676 --> 19:07.770
Has she said to you or Carmela
she's depressed?

19:08.380 --> 19:11.543
Come on with that shit.
She's gonna be all right.

19:12.317 --> 19:14.751
Maybe she should be on medication.

19:16.722 --> 19:20.158
And her anger is focused on Carmela,
not on you?

19:21.627 --> 19:23.288
I catch some shit.

19:23.729 --> 19:28.689
But me and Mead' were always close.
Even in that 15-year-old period, you know?

19:29.701 --> 19:32.295
When she could hardly stomach Carmela?

19:34.406 --> 19:35.964
You are the dad.

19:38.043 --> 19:40.534
The template for all future lovers.

19:41.647 --> 19:44.514
She loves me. I know that.

19:48.453 --> 19:50.478
Since she was a tiny baby.

19:52.791 --> 19:55.316
Might be helpful if she saw someone.

19:56.228 --> 19:57.855
Dr. Wendi Kobler.

19:58.030 --> 20:02.433
She's an adolescent psychologist
and an educational consultant.

20:02.501 --> 20:03.627
What do you mean?

20:03.702 --> 20:07.263
Talk about private family stuff,
like I do here, with you?

20:07.973 --> 20:08.962
Yes.

20:09.641 --> 20:12.576
Like you said, she's going back to school...

20:12.844 --> 20:15.904
she's gonna be with her college pals,
back to the grindstone.

20:15.981 --> 20:17.778
That's all good shit.

20:31.163 --> 20:34.064
I thought you had final registration today.

20:35.801 --> 20:39.430
Technically, drop-and-add goes on
for the next three weeks.

20:40.138 --> 20:43.301
Still, shouldn't you register
for the classes you know you want...

20:43.375 --> 20:45.240
so you don't lose them?

20:45.911 --> 20:47.037
Look...

20:47.813 --> 20:50.907
- I decided to take a year off.
- You what?

20:53.085 --> 20:55.485
And do what, loaf around the house?

20:55.554 --> 20:58.284
Actually, I'm going to Europe with Misty.

20:59.057 --> 21:01.082
What are you talking about?

21:02.461 --> 21:04.691
Look, Mom, I'm just not ready.

21:05.130 --> 21:08.099
If I go back now,
I'll have to start meeting with advisors...

21:08.166 --> 21:10.794
who'll at least want me
to temporarily declare a major...

21:10.869 --> 21:12.734
or independent course of study.

21:12.804 --> 21:14.931
I'll have that to deal with.

21:15.207 --> 21:18.142
And obviously
you don't want me around here.

21:22.314 --> 21:24.612
That is not what I said at all.

21:28.687 --> 21:30.985
You think I don't want you here?

21:31.657 --> 21:34.854
She knows what I fucking make.
Who am I? Bill Gates?

21:35.227 --> 21:37.286
I already support the kids.

21:37.362 --> 21:41.059
You're a bartender. You're supposed to be
listening to my problems.

21:43.035 --> 21:44.798
Sorry I'm late.

21:45.737 --> 21:47.671
- What's up?
- You tell me.

21:48.106 --> 21:51.564
Got a call from Jack Massarone.
Massarone Construction?

21:51.810 --> 21:53.038
A very angry call.

21:53.111 --> 21:55.306
The M80 in the porta-pot. I told Benny...

21:55.380 --> 21:57.473
Don't fuck with me on this.

22:00.385 --> 22:02.853
- The fiber-optic shit.
- You knew it would be boosted?

22:02.921 --> 22:06.516
No. Yeah.
I mean, Patsy mentioned something...

22:06.591 --> 22:09.287
Jesus Christ, if I wanted Patsy in charge...

22:10.095 --> 22:12.586
Use your fucking head, Christopher.

22:14.366 --> 22:15.993
I'm sorry, T, I thought I was.

22:16.068 --> 22:18.696
By drawing heat to a $250 million job?

22:19.738 --> 22:23.105
Think. The big fucking picture.

22:28.447 --> 22:30.176
Aren't they insured?

22:36.154 --> 22:38.088
She's nice, Janice, you know?

22:38.156 --> 22:41.922
- Not my usual type, but...
- Her hair, it's pretty.

22:42.627 --> 22:45.619
Pre-Raphaelite, they call it. With the curls.

22:48.300 --> 22:50.530
Nothing but net, motherfucker.

22:55.607 --> 22:58.269
She does have an earthy quality,
you got to give her that.

22:58.343 --> 23:00.140
It's those big tits.

23:00.612 --> 23:02.079
No disrespect.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.540
And, of course,
there's the issue of her family.

23:06.618 --> 23:10.281
Making her happy wouldn't be
the worst thing in the world for my career.

23:10.555 --> 23:11.647
Game.

23:16.828 --> 23:18.193
Where you going?

23:20.699 --> 23:22.223
Come on. I'm tired.

23:22.300 --> 23:23.927
Come on. One more.

23:34.980 --> 23:37.414
Come on, a little fucking defense.

23:39.785 --> 23:41.082
Hook shot.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.525
Thank God.

23:52.597 --> 23:54.929
Where is the number
of the therapist Melfi gave you?

23:55.000 --> 23:56.524
Why? What happened?

23:56.835 --> 23:58.803
She's going to Europe, your daughter.

23:58.870 --> 24:02.567
She's dropping out of school,
going all over the place on a Eurail Pass.

24:02.641 --> 24:04.768
- What is she, fucking kidding?
- Apparently not.

24:04.843 --> 24:07.744
Her passport from our Christmas
in the Bahamas is still valid.

24:07.813 --> 24:09.940
- Where is she?
- I don't know. Down the shore.

24:10.015 --> 24:11.880
I suppose all these parties she goes to...

24:11.950 --> 24:13.975
they're all memorials for Jackie Junior,
right?

24:14.052 --> 24:15.815
Please, with the yelling.

24:15.887 --> 24:19.118
- You still on-line?
- As a matter of fact, I am!

24:24.796 --> 24:26.889
What the fuck's in Europe?

24:27.499 --> 24:28.898
Experience.

24:28.967 --> 24:31.367
Real life. Art.

24:31.503 --> 24:34.495
I knew all this constant harping on art
was gonna cause trouble.

24:34.573 --> 24:36.268
Gonna work in publicity or something.

24:36.341 --> 24:39.640
Some friend of Misty's
is making a movie in Denmark.

24:40.245 --> 24:42.873
I think we should call that therapist.

24:44.416 --> 24:47.044
She's going back to school.
They got counselors there.

24:47.118 --> 24:49.416
Better ones, Ivy League ones.

24:51.022 --> 24:53.616
No fucking way she's going to Europe.

24:54.593 --> 24:55.617
Fine.

24:55.694 --> 24:57.855
<i>Maybe they don't have to talk.</i>

24:58.129 --> 25:02.293
<i>Maybe they're the kind of couple
that doesn't have to talk constantly.</i>

25:04.870 --> 25:06.269
One beer left?

25:06.338 --> 25:08.829
Danielle was over. We had pizza.

25:10.208 --> 25:13.803
I figured out what's wrong with that broad,
and it's some bad shit.

25:17.382 --> 25:20.749
What's the matter, baby? Tony again?

25:23.788 --> 25:27.656
I owe this guy a lot,
but he's a fucking jerk sometimes.

25:28.927 --> 25:31.657
Like he never heard of a learning curve.

25:33.565 --> 25:35.032
You know what?

25:36.134 --> 25:37.726
I'm gonna get high.

25:41.606 --> 25:45.303
I thought you were gonna stop using junk
'cause of your new job.

25:50.215 --> 25:51.307
I am.

25:51.983 --> 25:54.577
This is my goodbye party with heroin.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.381
You want to do a hit?

25:57.989 --> 26:00.753
I don't know. I did some blow at the club.

26:03.194 --> 26:04.422
It's funny with Tony.

26:04.496 --> 26:08.262
It's like Danielle was saying,
how we send food to the poorer countries.

26:08.333 --> 26:10.233
No good deed goes unpunished.

26:10.302 --> 26:12.236
What is it with you and this girl?

26:12.304 --> 26:15.967
- What? I can't have friends?
- You're amazing, you know that?

26:16.341 --> 26:19.902
With all your intelligence,
you never see the big picture.

26:21.212 --> 26:23.680
- You met her where?
- At the mall. So?

26:23.782 --> 26:25.647
Think, Adriana.

26:26.251 --> 26:28.981
Girl like that. Ass like that.

26:29.487 --> 26:31.853
She don't have a boyfriend,
she don't like Paulie.

26:31.923 --> 26:34.414
- Like he's Jude Law.
- Whatever.

26:36.861 --> 26:38.920
Are you that fucking blind?

26:44.269 --> 26:45.634
She's a dyke.

26:53.044 --> 26:54.204
You think?

27:01.319 --> 27:04.482
Use your head. It's a $250 million job.

27:05.624 --> 27:09.116
- My head? It was your idea.
- Excuse me?

27:09.561 --> 27:13.395
When the kid there, Vito,
told you how expensive the shit was...

27:14.499 --> 27:17.627
I don't know, you gave me a look.

27:18.103 --> 27:19.092
A look?

27:19.838 --> 27:22.033
So now you're a fucking mind reader?

27:22.107 --> 27:23.972
It won't happen again.

27:26.645 --> 27:30.206
Stop now, it'll be that much harder
to get back on track.

27:30.582 --> 27:32.015
Your mother's right.

27:32.083 --> 27:35.348
Just out of curiosity,
what are you planning on using for money?

27:35.420 --> 27:37.479
Cheap Tickets is running a sale.

27:37.555 --> 27:41.286
I can cash in the bonds Nana gave me,
and most likely I'll be working.

27:41.359 --> 27:43.088
Some student film.

27:43.762 --> 27:47.493
It's not a student film.
It's a feature on DVCAM.

27:48.066 --> 27:50.899
Alvar hangs out with Dogme.
He got honorable mention...

27:50.969 --> 27:53.699
at the Winnipeg Film Festival last year,
for his short.

27:53.772 --> 27:56.036
Forget money. What about security?

27:56.107 --> 27:59.076
You think traipsing around Europe's
a smart move these days?

27:59.144 --> 28:01.772
Like Europe's any less safe than here?

28:02.180 --> 28:04.478
Look, you don't seem to get it.

28:04.649 --> 28:08.380
I keep having images of Jackie Aprile
lying in a pool of his own blood...

28:08.453 --> 28:10.182
in some street somewhere.

28:12.223 --> 28:15.522
So what?
French discos drive away all sad thoughts?

28:16.294 --> 28:19.821
What, Mom, you've never heard
of the restorative nature of travel?

28:19.898 --> 28:21.525
Read Henry James.

28:21.833 --> 28:25.667
Why does every college have junior year
abroad if there isn't a need for it?

28:25.737 --> 28:28.763
Then why don't you wait for junior year?
It's eight months.

28:28.840 --> 28:30.205
'Cause I need it now.

28:30.275 --> 28:32.300
You want to go to Europe? Go.

28:33.011 --> 28:34.672
Clear your head. Run with the bulls.

28:34.746 --> 28:36.907
Do whatever it is the hell they do over there.

28:36.981 --> 28:38.642
Thank you. I will.

28:39.084 --> 28:41.951
Don't you think
she should talk to someone first?

28:42.020 --> 28:43.248
A counselor, maybe?

28:43.321 --> 28:45.881
Maybe the college of hard knocks
is what she needs.

28:45.957 --> 28:48.551
Let's see how she likes it
when a gypsy lifts her wallet.

28:48.626 --> 28:50.617
Or learn you can't work without a permit...

28:50.695 --> 28:53.630
which the French hang on to like their balls.

28:59.804 --> 29:01.897
Thank you for that united front.

29:01.973 --> 29:04.874
The more we object, the more
she'll want to go. You know her.

29:04.943 --> 29:08.003
She's going. I don't understand you,
with this flip-flop.

29:08.079 --> 29:09.239
She'll meet other boys.

29:09.314 --> 29:13.250
Maybe an Italian boy, an actual Italian one.
Jackie'll stop playing a big part...

29:13.318 --> 29:16.583
- You would want her married to a foreigner?
- Married, no! Jesus!

29:17.622 --> 29:20.887
Although, look at Furio.
What's so bad about him?

29:22.127 --> 29:23.526
You do what you want...

29:23.595 --> 29:26.723
but I am not gonna stand idle
while she throws her education away.

29:26.798 --> 29:27.856
What are you gonna do?

29:27.932 --> 29:31.390
She's not gonna take this drastic step
without talking to someone first.

29:31.469 --> 29:32.493
Come on.

29:32.570 --> 29:35.061
Dr. Melfi's person
is an educational consultant.

29:35.140 --> 29:37.768
Maybe she can explain to her
how dropping out now...

29:37.842 --> 29:40.504
is not going to look at all good
to medical schools.

29:40.578 --> 29:42.546
We could use an ally here...

29:42.614 --> 29:47.347
some adult, besides us, to toe the line
for accountability and responsibility.

29:53.858 --> 29:57.385
So maybe you go on an anti-depressant
to tide you over.

29:58.029 --> 30:00.020
You're not paying for it.

30:01.232 --> 30:02.995
I don't know. Maybe.

30:09.974 --> 30:12.636
Anyway, it was supposed to be his funeral.

30:13.211 --> 30:14.200
Jack's?

30:14.312 --> 30:16.780
And they all stood around...

30:17.048 --> 30:19.516
drinking and blubbering...

30:19.584 --> 30:23.384
at these egregious,
saccharine, fucking Italian ballads.

30:25.190 --> 30:26.384
It was revolting.

30:28.293 --> 30:30.693
After I left the restaurant, I actually vomited.

30:30.762 --> 30:34.323
- You were drinking.
- Smoked a joint with my friends, too.

30:35.166 --> 30:36.497
That's okay.

30:38.036 --> 30:40.834
As long as you didn't deliberately purge.

30:44.142 --> 30:47.168
When I asked you earlier
what Dad does for a living...

30:48.079 --> 30:49.444
you said:

30:50.515 --> 30:54.281
"Waste management, wink, wink. "
What does "wink, wink" mean?

30:56.588 --> 30:57.714
Okay.

30:59.057 --> 31:00.547
He's like...

31:03.027 --> 31:04.153
You know?

31:06.698 --> 31:09.166
You mentioned Jack's father
was in the mafia.

31:09.234 --> 31:11.634
I didn't realize your dad was, too.

31:15.807 --> 31:17.968
There's no such thing as the mafia.

31:18.676 --> 31:20.974
I said Jackie's dad was a loan shark.

31:28.887 --> 31:32.254
How did Dad react
when he heard Jack had been killed?

31:34.692 --> 31:36.250
He was pretty upset.

31:37.495 --> 31:41.158
He used to tell Jackie all the time,
"Don't get involved. Stay in school. "

31:42.700 --> 31:44.065
"Get involved"?

31:45.637 --> 31:46.865
With what?

31:51.376 --> 31:52.365
Drugs.

31:54.846 --> 31:55.835
Right.

31:56.881 --> 31:57.870
The "X"?

32:02.020 --> 32:04.955
So, Dad was a positive force in Jack's life.

32:05.523 --> 32:06.512
Jackie.

32:10.194 --> 32:11.183
Yeah.

32:13.064 --> 32:15.760
You don't like talking much
about Dad, do you?

32:19.070 --> 32:20.594
He doesn't bother me.

32:23.374 --> 32:26.002
I'm gonna ask you a question about Dad.

32:30.415 --> 32:32.474
This may be very painful for you.

32:36.154 --> 32:38.122
Did Dad ever molest you?

32:39.357 --> 32:43.589
- No.
- I don't tell them what we discuss.

32:49.167 --> 32:50.691
I don't think so.

32:51.169 --> 32:53.467
- What about Mom?
- God, no!

32:55.840 --> 32:59.799
Unless you consider obsessing about my
fucking GPA an assault, which I do.

32:59.877 --> 33:03.608
She has to learn
that education is a lifelong process.

33:03.848 --> 33:05.281
That's what I told them.

33:05.350 --> 33:10.049
A college degree is a nice thing, sure,
but not at the sake of emotional well-being.

33:10.388 --> 33:12.049
That's exactly what I said.

33:12.991 --> 33:16.791
Perhaps they should examine
their own needs to have you stay in school.

33:18.529 --> 33:20.963
Blow off their self-esteem issues.

33:21.499 --> 33:25.333
So, you book on Columbia,
you can come back when you're ready.

33:25.870 --> 33:29.169
Or I could write you a letter
to the University of Barcelona.

33:30.575 --> 33:32.236
It's a hot school.

33:32.543 --> 33:34.636
I'm on a consultancy there.

33:51.996 --> 33:54.055
- Busy out there?
- Bachelor party.

33:56.701 --> 33:59.226
Some asshole just slipped on a lime wedge.

34:03.474 --> 34:05.203
I was talking to Patsy.

34:07.111 --> 34:10.080
Sounds like Chrissy's
got a little Napoleon thing going on.

34:10.915 --> 34:12.041
Yeah?

34:13.083 --> 34:15.177
- Good.
- Right.

34:16.054 --> 34:19.251
Of course. Nobody's denying
his leadership abilities.

34:22.193 --> 34:23.956
So, what's the problem?

34:24.762 --> 34:27.925
It's just... I don't know.

34:28.331 --> 34:31.165
Patsy feels bad, maybe he was passed over.

34:32.335 --> 34:33.928
What the fuck do you care?

34:34.005 --> 34:36.599
Last year, you were pushing me
to take him out.

34:37.074 --> 34:39.737
I'm just saying,
with the change of rank and all...

34:39.844 --> 34:41.436
maybe he feels...

34:42.647 --> 34:44.114
marginalized.

34:45.449 --> 34:46.940
Marginalized?

34:48.686 --> 34:50.516
What the fuck does that even mean?

35:06.804 --> 35:09.329
I like your pants. Leather?

35:10.141 --> 35:12.336
Yeah. I got them at Bebe.

35:12.910 --> 35:14.377
Fucking packed tonight!

35:14.779 --> 35:15.939
Let's celebrate.

35:25.356 --> 35:27.620
No, thanks.
I'm gonna stick with the champagne.

35:27.692 --> 35:30.991
It's primo shit, Danny.
We got an awesome connection.

35:31.395 --> 35:32.589
It's okay.

35:39.971 --> 35:41.461
So, I was thinking, right?

35:42.206 --> 35:44.106
What we do is start our own group.

35:44.175 --> 35:46.507
I'll be the singer,
and you two can back me up.

35:46.577 --> 35:47.601
- Please.
- Right.

35:47.678 --> 35:49.976
What? It's so hard to rap?

35:50.581 --> 35:53.778
<i>My bitch, my ho, my ho
My bitch, my bitch, bitch</i>

35:53.851 --> 35:55.842
- What? It's a joke?
- Stop!

35:55.920 --> 35:58.286
- You don't wanna back me up?
- Stop!

36:00.791 --> 36:01.780
God.

36:03.828 --> 36:05.921
- That's gorgeous.
- Isn't it?

36:06.898 --> 36:10.459
- Christopher gave it to me.
- You like it, baby?

36:27.652 --> 36:29.620
- What are you doing?
- What?

36:30.588 --> 36:31.646
I'm gonna go.

36:31.756 --> 36:33.815
What? Hang out. What's the matter?

36:35.059 --> 36:36.890
I'll call you tomorrow.

36:40.965 --> 36:42.762
You piece of fucking shit!

36:43.201 --> 36:45.795
- What the fuck?
- I saw what you did. What'd you think?

36:45.870 --> 36:49.397
You were gonna fuck the two of us?
You and those fucking videos!

36:49.473 --> 36:50.565
She came onto me!

36:50.641 --> 36:53.041
She took my hand,
she was rubbing it on herself.

36:53.110 --> 36:55.670
- Bullshit!
- How about right before you came over?

36:55.746 --> 36:57.680
She was telling me
where she buys her pants.

36:57.748 --> 37:01.013
Her fucking underwear and shit.
Fucking Bebe's, like I give a fuck.

37:01.085 --> 37:04.111
- I thought you said she was gay.
- Who knows what her problem is?

37:04.188 --> 37:06.247
Broad like her will fuck a snake.

37:06.891 --> 37:08.119
Use your head.

37:08.526 --> 37:10.824
What do I want with that skank,
when I got you?

37:10.895 --> 37:12.726
You were saying she had a nice ass.

37:12.930 --> 37:16.263
I was trying to say something positive,
'cause she's your friend.

37:19.704 --> 37:20.932
Come here.

37:26.911 --> 37:29.402
<i>What have I been telling you
about this pucchiachia?</i>

37:31.415 --> 37:33.508
She's trying to fuck us up, Adriana.

37:34.852 --> 37:38.583
And what we have
is stronger than any of that shit.

37:47.732 --> 37:49.029
I'm sorry.

37:52.236 --> 37:53.931
Son of a fucking bitch.

37:58.609 --> 38:00.372
What happened to the Krazy Glue?

38:02.313 --> 38:04.907
Somebody left the top off. Dried out.

38:08.653 --> 38:10.644
- What'd you want?
- Nothing, really.

38:10.721 --> 38:13.281
You should see the floor tiles, though...

38:13.391 --> 38:15.655
that got delivered to the job site.

38:16.060 --> 38:19.757
- Mexican travertine.
- Johnny Sposato will take that shit.

38:20.231 --> 38:23.359
No more dipping at the job,
according to fucking Alfalfa.

38:24.802 --> 38:27.202
But the order comes down from Tony.

38:32.943 --> 38:34.604
- Go ahead.
- What?

38:35.646 --> 38:37.011
Knock off the tile?

38:38.749 --> 38:40.944
- Tony says no.
- I got your back.

38:42.253 --> 38:43.914
Tony will be fine with it.

39:14.251 --> 39:17.550
The rotor on the washing machine broke.
Carm said I could use yours.

39:18.756 --> 39:21.316
Clean out the filter this time. Disgusting.

39:33.504 --> 39:34.937
So, how's your love life?

39:36.841 --> 39:38.706
Why don't you mind
your goddamn business?

39:38.776 --> 39:40.573
It feels like it is my business...

39:40.644 --> 39:44.671
considering I had to haul your last
boyfriend out of your kitchen in a Hefty bag.

39:44.749 --> 39:46.842
You're a miserable fuck, you know that?

39:48.252 --> 39:50.243
- You're just like Ma.
- Oh, yeah?

39:50.321 --> 39:51.310
Really.

39:51.389 --> 39:54.017
With your condescension
and your sabotage.

39:54.091 --> 39:56.992
For your information, Ralph is a great guy.

39:57.061 --> 39:59.723
Trust me, I got more information
than I need about him.

39:59.797 --> 40:01.264
It's always something.

40:01.332 --> 40:04.096
Are you threatened by the fact
that he has a sense of style?

40:04.168 --> 40:06.830
- A sense of style?
- Ralph Lauren, Collegiate?

40:06.971 --> 40:10.304
Let me ask you a question.
Do I know this guy better than you?

40:10.408 --> 40:12.467
'Cause I'm telling you he's no fucking good.

40:12.543 --> 40:15.774
My happiness
really drives you crazy, doesn't it?

40:24.155 --> 40:27.215
This reorganization of the Bureau
could be good for both of us.

40:36.100 --> 40:39.297
- Lilac Personal Shopping.
- Five fucking messages, Danielle?

40:39.603 --> 40:41.002
Can't you take a hint?

40:41.071 --> 40:42.538
<i>Stop fucking calling here.</i>

40:43.073 --> 40:46.167
<i>- Sweetie, don't be like that.
- "Sweetie," bullshit.</i>

40:46.544 --> 40:49.672
- You're lucky I don't rip your ass.
- I thought we were friends.

40:49.747 --> 40:52.807
Did you take his hand off your leg?
Did you?

40:52.950 --> 40:54.713
- I tried.
- Bullshit!

40:55.453 --> 40:57.444
Don't ever fucking call me anymore.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.324
Four fucking months of work.

41:06.797 --> 41:08.731
Maybe if we let her cool off.

41:08.966 --> 41:11.457
She thinks I tried to seduce
her fiancé, Dwight.

41:11.535 --> 41:14.231
- Little shitbag that he is.
- What now?

41:15.372 --> 41:16.964
Do we set someone else up?

41:17.374 --> 41:19.740
And waste another five months
getting in close?

41:19.810 --> 41:21.835
Her guard will be up anyway.

41:22.913 --> 41:26.144
I think we should consider
the undercover-op a dead issue.

41:26.684 --> 41:28.777
Let's just bring her in, straight up.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.957
Still, in all, good work, Ciccerone.

41:34.792 --> 41:36.953
Right. Thanks.

41:42.466 --> 41:44.525
You know what the problem is, right?

41:45.569 --> 41:47.332
She gave Moltisanti a hard-on.

41:48.639 --> 41:51.267
<i>So, what do we do? Hire only schifosas?</i>

41:52.943 --> 41:55.844
You know, I had a dream about her
the other night.

42:24.308 --> 42:26.071
This boring cocksucker.

42:26.510 --> 42:28.705
Jehovah's Witnesses are more interesting.

42:28.779 --> 42:32.271
Jack! How's your balls?
What are you doing here?

42:32.349 --> 42:34.783
I got a foursome with some city engineers.

42:34.952 --> 42:36.943
- You got a sec?
- Sure.

42:37.221 --> 42:39.018
Artie Bucco, Jack Massarone.

42:39.089 --> 42:41.284
Sure, you been in my restaurant.

42:41.458 --> 42:44.086
- Problem with the stracciatelle, right?
- Yeah.

42:45.162 --> 42:46.459
Come on.

42:51.302 --> 42:52.496
It's all right.

42:52.570 --> 42:55.767
Listen, I don't mean to be a pest,
but some of your guys...

42:55.839 --> 42:58.967
- I told you I'd take care of that.
- This is not the fiber-optics.

42:59.043 --> 43:00.977
I'm talking about the floor tiles.

43:02.446 --> 43:05.882
- What floor tiles?
- Last night, somebody hijacked a trailer.

43:06.050 --> 43:08.610
The truck crushed a shed
on its way out, too.

43:19.964 --> 43:21.955
My mother's expecting us.

43:26.136 --> 43:28.104
Look what the cat dragged in.

43:29.106 --> 43:30.630
Fucking greedy cocksucker!

43:30.708 --> 43:34.109
You had to come back for more?
Fucking floor tiles, now!

43:34.178 --> 43:36.544
- You little fucking prick!
- Come on.

43:37.381 --> 43:40.441
- Relax, fellas!
- Mind your own fucking business.

43:40.517 --> 43:41.779
What'd I say?

43:41.852 --> 43:45.049
I distinctly told you
to lay off this fucking job!

43:45.155 --> 43:48.215
Talk to Silvio!
He gave the order, you stupid fuck!

43:48.292 --> 43:50.590
What'd you call me?

43:51.295 --> 43:53.024
That's right.

43:53.097 --> 43:56.157
Little fucking tough guy? You bastard.

43:56.600 --> 44:00.900
You work for me, not fucking Silvio.
I told you to knock it off.

44:01.338 --> 44:03.829
- I'm calling the police.
- Don't think I forgot...

44:03.907 --> 44:06.467
about you going through
my fiancée's underwear drawer.

44:06.543 --> 44:09.478
- That wasn't me, you fucking jerk.
- We'll see.

44:15.419 --> 44:16.909
Who the fuck are you?

44:17.054 --> 44:18.851
Ralph Bunche, over here?

44:19.957 --> 44:21.481
You motherfucker!

44:21.558 --> 44:22.820
Oh, my God.

44:23.727 --> 44:26.457
- Let me go!
- Let's just get outta here.

44:26.530 --> 44:29.829
Get him to the fucking hospital.
Make sure he keeps his mouth shut.

44:29.967 --> 44:32.125
Keep your fucking mouth shut!

44:33.904 --> 44:35.303
Right, he's the one.

44:36.940 --> 44:39.238
I never said they shouldn't get engaged.

44:40.310 --> 44:41.299
Mom?

44:43.514 --> 44:45.379
Can I have a tuna san?

44:51.789 --> 44:54.622
- Hang up that phone, please.
- Excuse me?

44:58.328 --> 45:00.091
Can I call you back?

45:05.269 --> 45:07.464
- Did you go to see Dr. Kobler?
- Yeah.

45:09.039 --> 45:10.666
What did you talk about?

45:10.741 --> 45:13.733
She said I don't have to tell you or Dad.
It's confidential.

45:13.844 --> 45:16.039
This is what we pay $200 for?

45:16.814 --> 45:20.306
It was your idea.
I only saw her out of a gesture of goodwill.

45:22.119 --> 45:24.246
I don't know what you're so upset about.

45:24.321 --> 45:26.949
It's my right to go to Europe.
That's what she said.

45:27.191 --> 45:30.024
I don't care what she said.
She's totally irresponsible.

45:34.164 --> 45:35.256
What?

45:36.266 --> 45:39.235
The therapist told her
it is her right to go to Europe.

45:42.673 --> 45:45.403
She actually thinks this is a good idea?

45:57.154 --> 46:00.954
She said it's no big deal. I can pick
up my education wherever, whenever.

46:01.024 --> 46:02.082
Really?

46:02.159 --> 46:05.560
Wendi said she can get me into school
in Barcelona if I decide to stay.

46:05.629 --> 46:07.995
- Who's Wendi?
- Dr. Wendi Kobler.

46:08.065 --> 46:09.054
Barcelona.

46:09.399 --> 46:12.368
I could take Melfi's head
and crush it like a fucking walnut.

46:12.436 --> 46:13.801
I feel battered.

46:14.271 --> 46:16.171
I've gotta get to the salon.

46:16.974 --> 46:19.602
Did you tell Wendi
that you didn't work all summer?

46:21.411 --> 46:23.140
Wait, you're right.

46:23.247 --> 46:26.910
I forgot to mention the pivotal role
of the work ethic in this family.

46:26.984 --> 46:30.181
- You can lose that smart mouth right now.
- Or what?

46:30.387 --> 46:31.979
What is this, Afghanistan?

46:32.222 --> 46:35.885
I'm over 18 now, I'm a grown woman.
I can go where I want and do what I want.

46:35.959 --> 46:39.622
All right, Jesus, God, we know that!
Is that your only point here?

46:40.164 --> 46:43.361
Because just getting what you want
is for babies, not adults.

46:48.605 --> 46:52.166
It may interest you to know
she thinks I should probably be on Prozac.

46:52.242 --> 46:53.869
- She does?
- She said that?

46:53.944 --> 46:56.105
Jackie was murdered. I know you think...

46:56.180 --> 46:59.775
it's nothing screaming my head off
at the Columbia-Army game wouldn't cure.

46:59.850 --> 47:02.375
- That is so unfair.
- All right, look.

47:02.686 --> 47:04.313
I've been thinking about this.

47:04.988 --> 47:08.822
Now, you're a smart girl.
The right move for you is to wait.

47:09.693 --> 47:11.786
Just till next year, maybe.

47:11.862 --> 47:13.989
You know what I don't understand, Dad?

47:14.431 --> 47:17.730
- You were all in favor of me going.
- Your mother doesn't want it.

47:18.969 --> 47:19.958
Wow.

47:20.871 --> 47:22.463
Listen to Mr. Mob Boss.

47:23.040 --> 47:24.200
What did you call me?

47:24.274 --> 47:27.471
All this fucking pussyfooting around.
Years now?

47:27.678 --> 47:30.306
- Why don't we just get it all out there?
- Shut up.

47:33.750 --> 47:35.843
You got something you wanna say to me?

47:35.919 --> 47:37.784
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

47:37.855 --> 47:40.619
What do you mean? All these innuendoes.

47:41.658 --> 47:44.058
You inferring
I didn't do everything I could...

47:44.127 --> 47:46.527
to keep that kid from fucking himself up?

47:48.098 --> 47:50.464
That, knowing him and his family...

47:50.534 --> 47:53.526
that I didn't try to be a better dad to him
than his own dad?

47:53.604 --> 47:57.131
God rest his soul.
That I didn't try to protect Jackie Junior?

47:57.207 --> 48:00.005
That I didn't smack him around,
'cause I was so frustrated?

48:00.077 --> 48:02.238
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

48:03.480 --> 48:07.439
I'm through telling people
you help with environmental cleanup.

48:07.551 --> 48:08.916
That's not what I asked you.

48:08.986 --> 48:11.716
Like you could talk honestly
for three fucking seconds.

48:11.788 --> 48:13.153
You try me!

48:20.731 --> 48:24.929
I've made my plans, I'm going to Europe,
and I'm getting the fuck out of here!

48:25.002 --> 48:26.993
- You been told no!
- Watch me!

48:27.070 --> 48:30.005
Don't do it! I'm warning you, do not do it!

48:40.317 --> 48:41.682
Do it for Mommy.

48:42.586 --> 48:44.451
That's a good girl.

48:55.465 --> 48:57.797
Special agent Dwight Harris, FBI.

48:58.535 --> 49:00.594
I believe you two have already met.

49:01.505 --> 49:02.836
Holy fucking shit!

49:02.906 --> 49:05.534
Don't make a scene.
You don't want to attract attention.

49:05.609 --> 49:08.271
- You're in the fucking FBI?
- We need to talk, Ade.

49:08.345 --> 49:11.906
It'll only take a half hour,
and I assure you, it's in your best interest.

49:11.982 --> 49:13.779
Come with us, please.

49:13.884 --> 49:15.681
- My dog.
- It's okay.

49:16.219 --> 49:17.811
Just take her with you.

49:28.131 --> 49:29.359
Am I under arrest?

49:30.100 --> 49:33.433
Not at this time,
but that can all change momentarily.

49:35.205 --> 49:39.232
That's a search warrant.
Your office, your club, your cocaine.

49:39.743 --> 49:41.904
- It's not my cocaine.
- Really?

49:42.179 --> 49:45.307
- That's not what I have you saying on tape.
- You were taping me?

49:45.382 --> 49:48.943
If I were you, I'd put aside
my hurt feelings for a while.

49:54.491 --> 49:58.518
I told you shit in confidence
that had nothing to do with any of this shit!

49:58.628 --> 50:00.858
Things that I never told no one.

50:00.998 --> 50:03.432
We're offering you a way out.

50:03.533 --> 50:06.058
A chance to save your life
and Christopher's life.

50:06.169 --> 50:08.399
You don't give a fuck about us!

50:08.472 --> 50:10.963
You and your fucking ob-gyn doctor.

50:11.375 --> 50:12.774
You wanted me and Christopher...

50:12.843 --> 50:15.812
to stay together long enough
so you could find shit out.

50:25.122 --> 50:28.182
We understand your fiancé
is moving up in the world...

50:28.291 --> 50:29.758
or down, as the case may be.

50:29.826 --> 50:32.351
Problems at the Esplanade
construction site?

50:32.429 --> 50:33.453
Oh, my God.

50:34.765 --> 50:38.496
We're not asking you to wear a wire.
We're not asking you to testify.

50:38.835 --> 50:40.769
We just want information.

50:42.906 --> 50:44.999
Is your name even Danielle?

50:56.853 --> 50:58.320
What if I say no?

50:58.388 --> 51:01.016
If you say no,
you'll be placed under arrest...

51:01.091 --> 51:04.185
and charged with possession
and intent to distribute cocaine...

51:04.861 --> 51:09.025
a charge that carries with it
a penalty of up to 25 years in prison.

51:09.266 --> 51:10.324
Oh, my God.

51:10.400 --> 51:12.891
After you make bail,
you can explain to Tony Soprano...

51:12.969 --> 51:16.803
why you brought an undercover federal
agent into his home during Sunday dinner.

51:16.873 --> 51:19.637
- My God.
- We'll probably never hear about it though.

51:19.709 --> 51:23.236
Chances are you and Christopher
will just disappear.

51:28.151 --> 51:29.448
Get the wastebasket.

51:47.471 --> 51:48.460
Come on.

51:52.542 --> 51:54.806
I left three messages. Are you okay?

51:57.147 --> 51:58.512
You look like shit.

52:01.985 --> 52:03.452
I didn't sleep too good.

52:04.187 --> 52:05.313
It's Meadow.

52:06.189 --> 52:08.817
I don't know.
We think maybe she ran off to Europe.

52:09.960 --> 52:10.949
Europe?

52:15.398 --> 52:17.559
- So, you got a minute?
- Who's that?

52:18.135 --> 52:19.830
Nobody, go back to sleep.

52:22.873 --> 52:24.238
How you doing, hon?

52:36.586 --> 52:38.281
This floor tile shit...

52:38.688 --> 52:40.019
misunderstanding.

52:45.162 --> 52:46.595
It's a huge job.

52:47.597 --> 52:49.087
A lot of money at stake.

52:50.000 --> 52:51.831
You of all people should know that.

52:52.269 --> 52:53.827
What? Are you mad at me now?

52:56.206 --> 52:59.664
You're getting to be a very strange man
in your old age, you know that?

52:59.743 --> 53:00.835
What?

53:01.645 --> 53:02.907
I'm just asking.

53:04.014 --> 53:06.244
Is it a hanging offense, or not?

53:08.919 --> 53:10.887
Did you deliberately disobey me?

53:11.087 --> 53:12.247
Of course not.

53:13.356 --> 53:15.415
'Cause Patsy says you gave the okay.

53:17.194 --> 53:19.321
This is after Chrissy talked to him.

53:19.396 --> 53:20.954
Timeline got fucked up.

53:22.832 --> 53:25.960
- We go back a long way.
- Indeed we do.

53:26.403 --> 53:28.462
If in any way you feel like...

53:28.605 --> 53:33.008
Chrissy usurped you or anything like that,
and you're trying to read me...

53:35.845 --> 53:38.609
- That's not how it is.
- Fine.

53:40.584 --> 53:43.553
Whole thing, misunderstanding.

53:51.328 --> 53:52.795
Truckload of floor tiles.

53:54.564 --> 53:57.192
You should be looking at what, $30,000?

54:00.337 --> 54:04.034
Should be about $2,000 there.
I'll have the rest for you later.

54:06.076 --> 54:07.566
I know you will.

54:21.057 --> 54:23.355
What? You catch some shrapnel?

54:27.497 --> 54:29.829
"Intro to Social Theory" is...

54:30.834 --> 54:32.301
Sorry, it's closed out.

54:34.471 --> 54:37.668
You're cutting it a little close
for most of the popular classes.

54:48.485 --> 54:51.477
- What about this one?
- 09531?

54:55.392 --> 54:56.654
It's your lucky day.

55:17.080 --> 55:19.071
I've been thinking, and if you want...

55:19.983 --> 55:22.975
we can talk to your cousin Brian
about the estate planning.

55:24.387 --> 55:26.912
Listen to him, now.
What? Do you feel guilty?

55:28.258 --> 55:30.226
You have nothing to feel guilty about.

55:31.661 --> 55:32.923
It's me she blames.

55:35.165 --> 55:36.462
What for?

55:37.305 --> 55:43.290
