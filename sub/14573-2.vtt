00:09.277 --> 00:10.611
You're welcome.

00:14.915 --> 00:17.251
(money rustling)

00:24.592 --> 00:26.194
Hey, Jamie.

00:30.398 --> 00:32.266
Hey, how's it going?

00:32.300 --> 00:33.567
It's going okay.

00:35.936 --> 00:37.004
Hey, uh--

00:37.037 --> 00:38.406
Please don't.

00:38.439 --> 00:39.507
Please don't
do it.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.075
Just...

00:41.109 --> 00:43.744
please don't make me say
no to you all nice and--

00:43.777 --> 00:45.279
Just don't ask, okay?

00:45.313 --> 00:48.082
I just don't--
I don't wanna...

00:48.116 --> 00:50.084
live that right now.

00:50.118 --> 00:53.287
Okay, I--

00:53.321 --> 00:56.090
I--

00:56.124 --> 00:59.560
Dude, you gotta stop
asking everybody out.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.862
Can't ask everybody.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.732
You think people
like saying no?

01:04.765 --> 01:06.600
Takes its toll.

01:06.634 --> 01:08.302
Sorry.

01:10.504 --> 01:11.539
Louie?

01:11.572 --> 01:12.940
Hey, Jerry, what's up?

01:12.973 --> 01:14.142
Hey, what are you
doing tomorrow night?

01:14.175 --> 01:15.809
Tomorrow night?

01:15.843 --> 01:19.079
Yeah, I'm doing a benefit
out in East Hampton.

01:19.113 --> 01:20.080
You know, Long Island?

01:20.114 --> 01:21.615
Yeah, no, I--

01:21.649 --> 01:23.050
Yeah, see Tom Papa was
supposed to do it,

01:23.083 --> 01:24.218
but he got sick,
he can't do it.

01:24.252 --> 01:25.819
Could you do it?

01:25.853 --> 01:27.255
You just gotta do like ten
minutes in front of me.

01:27.288 --> 01:29.257
Yeah, sure, yes.

01:29.290 --> 01:33.961
Really?
It's at 5:00, a place called
The Carlyle in East Hampton.

01:33.994 --> 01:35.263
Can you get
yourself there?

01:35.296 --> 01:36.997
Yes, I can do
that, sure.

01:37.030 --> 01:38.432
Really, can--
Yeah.

01:38.466 --> 01:39.600
Can you work clean?

01:39.633 --> 01:41.068
Clean?

01:41.101 --> 01:43.237
Yeah, can you not
curse, can you not...

01:43.271 --> 01:45.573
say dirty, sex,

01:45.606 --> 01:51.479
poop, dogs having
sex with vagina dirt?

01:51.512 --> 01:54.081
Yeah, I can avoid
that stuff, yes.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.150
Okay.

01:56.184 --> 01:57.485
All right.

01:57.518 --> 01:58.952
This'll be good,
this'll be good.

01:58.986 --> 02:00.788
There's no money,
it's a benefit.

02:00.821 --> 02:02.856
But, you know, these--
these things can be good.

02:02.890 --> 02:03.857
I think it'll be
good for you.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.426
Okay, I'm in, sure.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.694
Okay, 5:00 show time.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.162
All right, 5:00.
Carlyle.

02:08.196 --> 02:09.863
East Hampton.

02:09.897 --> 02:10.964
Show starts at 5:00.
Yeah.

02:10.998 --> 02:12.433
Okay, yeah.
Okay

02:12.466 --> 02:13.834
What's it, uh,
what's-- who are the...

02:13.867 --> 02:14.968
It's, uh...

02:15.002 --> 02:16.103
The benefit?
Uh.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.104
It's heart disease.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.306
Ah, okay, good.
Yeah.

02:18.339 --> 02:19.373
It's good.

02:19.407 --> 02:22.009
You know, wanna...
not have that.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.180
Clean jokes.

02:30.818 --> 02:33.153
Chickens...

02:34.722 --> 02:37.825
are...

02:37.858 --> 02:39.527
Chickens are dumb.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.663
Chickens are stupid.

02:48.168 --> 02:51.872
**

03:07.788 --> 03:10.458
Oh, shit.

03:22.470 --> 03:25.973
(woman singing in French)

03:31.245 --> 03:34.114
(cameras clicking)

03:43.291 --> 03:44.458
Excuse me.

03:44.492 --> 03:45.459
This is
a private affair.

03:45.493 --> 03:46.927
I'm, uh, entertaining,

03:46.960 --> 03:50.398
I'm a performer
on the sh-- show.

03:50.431 --> 03:51.732
Are you the drummer?

03:51.765 --> 03:53.200
No, I'm a comedian.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.303
I'm opening
for Jerry.

03:55.336 --> 03:56.737
You're opening for
Mr. Seinfeld?

03:56.770 --> 03:58.539
Yeah, I'm on first,
I'm the--

03:58.572 --> 03:59.873
Oh.

03:59.907 --> 04:04.244
Oh, God, Louie,
what the--

04:04.278 --> 04:07.247
I didn't know,
I didn't know.

04:07.281 --> 04:09.783
Benefit, Hamptons.

04:09.817 --> 04:13.153
Come on, Louie, it's in
the manual, and you're late.

04:13.186 --> 04:15.088
No, it's 5:00.

04:18.926 --> 04:21.094
Five--

04:21.128 --> 04:22.930
Come on.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.298
You said 5:00.

04:27.701 --> 04:28.969
Who are all these people?

04:29.002 --> 04:30.471
I don't-- they
look like celebrities

04:30.504 --> 04:32.506
but I don't recognize
any of them.

04:32.540 --> 04:33.841
These are
the billionaires

04:33.874 --> 04:36.109
and trillionaires
of Hampton Beach.

04:37.311 --> 04:39.580
There are
trillionaires now?

04:39.613 --> 04:40.648
Yeah.

04:46.387 --> 04:47.355
Hey, can you
help me out?

04:47.388 --> 04:48.589
What do you need?

04:48.622 --> 04:50.391
Get-- let me
have your jacket.

04:52.360 --> 04:53.494
Here you go.
Thank you.

04:53.527 --> 04:55.429
Here, put this on.

04:55.463 --> 04:57.130
It's got badges on
it and stuff.

04:57.164 --> 04:59.266
You're fine,
just put it on.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.702
It's a security--

05:01.735 --> 05:03.036
Start the show.

05:06.907 --> 05:09.410
(distant chatter)

05:12.880 --> 05:14.882
Are you gonna
introduce me?

05:16.350 --> 05:18.619
No, you're gonna
introduce me.

05:18.652 --> 05:21.689
That is why
you're here, okay?

05:21.722 --> 05:25.125
You go on, just do a few
minutes and bring me up.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.860
Sorry, uh...

05:26.894 --> 05:28.562
It's pretty simple.

05:30.498 --> 05:33.634
All right, hit
the lights, let's get started.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.269
What's even the name
of the charity--
It doesn't matter.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.707
I don't know what
the charity is, is--

05:39.740 --> 05:42.042
Mhm.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.711
Just go out
there, Louie.

05:49.049 --> 05:51.519
(silverware clanking)

05:56.023 --> 05:58.325
(scattered applause)

05:58.358 --> 06:00.060
Good evening, uh--

06:00.093 --> 06:03.030
Uh, hi, there, good-- thank you
very much, thank you, uh...

06:04.632 --> 06:06.099
Give yourselves, uh,

06:06.133 --> 06:08.101
a great time for
coming out, um--

06:08.135 --> 06:09.503
Give yourselves a round--

06:09.537 --> 06:11.038
(scattered applause)

06:11.071 --> 06:14.608
Coming out,
good job for you guys.

06:16.309 --> 06:19.046
Uh, hey, it's
cold outside.

06:19.079 --> 06:21.749
I mean, it wasn't--
I mean, it was, uh, pretty warm.

06:21.782 --> 06:23.584
I don't know.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.385
It's crazy.

06:25.419 --> 06:26.587
(woman laughing)

06:26.620 --> 06:29.289
Uh...

06:29.322 --> 06:30.591
Do you ever--
(clearing throat)

06:30.624 --> 06:33.694
Chickens are dumb, right?

06:33.727 --> 06:35.563
(woman giggling)

06:35.596 --> 06:38.432
They don't even... how long have
we been eating chickens

06:38.466 --> 06:39.967
and they don't get--

06:40.000 --> 06:41.401
they're not
a little wary at this point,

06:41.435 --> 06:43.704
they don't-- haven't risen up.

06:43.737 --> 06:47.641
There's been no
Martin Luther Chicken?

06:47.675 --> 06:49.142
(woman laughing)

06:49.176 --> 06:51.044
If there was
one of those...

06:51.078 --> 06:54.915
Um, you know, you know when you
go to the, uh, supermarket?

06:54.948 --> 06:56.650
Not that any of you
would ever

06:56.684 --> 06:59.587
do your own
shopping, uh...

06:59.620 --> 07:02.823
I know you guys don't shop
for yourselves...

07:02.856 --> 07:06.426
(woman laughing)
Of course, um...

07:06.460 --> 07:09.162
Because you all have,
um, slaves somehow still.

07:09.196 --> 07:10.831
(woman laughing)

07:10.864 --> 07:14.668
Uh, no, I mean, uh, you know,
peop-- I just mean,

07:14.702 --> 07:18.639
people that work for you
who, duh, you all don't pay.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.107
(woman laughing)

07:20.140 --> 07:22.710
Um... you came-- this is your...

07:24.011 --> 07:26.914
Your soul
laundering service.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.282
(woman laughing)

07:29.316 --> 07:30.818
Great, huh?

07:30.851 --> 07:33.521
Great to--
thank you for, um...

07:33.554 --> 07:36.289
It's good that you guys
came out for the...

07:36.323 --> 07:37.591
(people whistling)

07:37.625 --> 07:39.459
Great, all right.

07:39.493 --> 07:41.028
All right, I'm gonna go ahead--

07:41.061 --> 07:43.030
I am gonna go ahead
and bring on your headliner.

07:43.063 --> 07:45.165
This is a great, uh, man,

07:45.198 --> 07:47.200
we're all very
excited to see him.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.036
Please, a nice, warm welcome for
the great Jerry Seinfeld,

07:49.069 --> 07:50.037
Ladies and gentlemen.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.540
(cheering and applause)

07:58.245 --> 08:00.714
Thank you.

08:00.748 --> 08:03.316
Thank you, Louie.

08:03.350 --> 08:05.686
That was pretty much a total
disaster, wasn't it?

08:05.719 --> 08:09.156
I don't think I've ever seen
anybody do worse than that.

08:09.189 --> 08:11.358
But, uh, we
thank you for coming.

08:11.391 --> 08:13.994
Especially since
we're here to raise money for

08:14.027 --> 08:15.395
the World Heart Alliance.

08:15.428 --> 08:16.897
(applause)

08:24.071 --> 08:25.973
I think if we had the choice of
heart disease

08:26.006 --> 08:28.241
or watching
any more of Louie,

08:28.275 --> 08:29.577
we might pick the disease.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.378
(crowd laughing)

08:31.411 --> 08:33.513
Anyway, he did a pretty good
job, certainly dressed well.

08:33.547 --> 08:36.383
I really liked his jacket,
he certainly, uh...

08:36.416 --> 08:38.586
seems ready for his
next line of employment,

08:38.619 --> 08:40.921
it looked like to me.

08:40.954 --> 08:45.425
Some sort of minimum wage
security work, anyway...

08:45.458 --> 08:50.063
Um, I have a lot of, uh...

08:50.097 --> 08:51.498
I have a lot of friends that
play golf.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.767
They like golf,
I don't play golf.

08:53.801 --> 08:56.937
Um, golfers will tell you that
it's a very challenging game.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.505
That's the one thing
that they can tell you.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.440
It's very challenging.

09:00.473 --> 09:02.442
I'm quite sure that it
is challenging.

09:02.475 --> 09:04.344
It's also challenging
trying to throw a Tic Tac

09:04.377 --> 09:07.247
100 yards into a shoebox,
that's also challenging.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.949
But we don't do it.

09:16.489 --> 09:17.825
(sighing)

09:19.660 --> 09:20.961
(yelling) Shit!

09:25.733 --> 09:27.200
Chickens are--

09:27.234 --> 09:28.636
(paper crumpling)

09:30.904 --> 09:32.606
(woman)
Hey!

09:32.640 --> 09:34.341
You were just
up there!

09:35.776 --> 09:37.210
What's that?!

09:37.244 --> 09:38.946
You were just
up there!

09:41.081 --> 09:43.083
(laughing) Oh, my God.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.185
That was hysterical!

09:46.419 --> 09:48.088
You--

09:48.121 --> 09:50.290
You must've be the one
that was laughing.

09:50.323 --> 09:52.359
Yes, I was dying.

09:54.161 --> 09:56.229
I'm glad I was, uh,
good for somebody.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.231
No, you were awful.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.801
That's why
it was so funny.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.269
Sorry?

10:02.302 --> 10:05.072
(screaming) You were awful!

10:05.105 --> 10:08.275
Thank you.

10:08.308 --> 10:09.743
No, I mean, you
were just wrong.

10:09.777 --> 10:11.611
You were very wrong
for this crowd.

10:11.645 --> 10:12.680
I could see it
the second

10:12.713 --> 10:14.414
that you walked out,
I mean...

10:14.447 --> 10:15.749
(laughing)

10:15.783 --> 10:18.451
The whole thing was
just such a train wreck.

10:18.485 --> 10:19.486
(chuckling)

10:19.519 --> 10:20.654
It made my week.

10:20.688 --> 10:22.022
I mean, if you only knew

10:22.055 --> 10:23.490
what assholes these
people really are

10:23.523 --> 10:25.025
and the fact that
they all hated you

10:25.058 --> 10:29.863
makes you my hero.

10:29.897 --> 10:31.865
I-- I can't really,
I can't really hear
anything you're saying.

10:31.899 --> 10:33.300
What?!

10:33.333 --> 10:34.501
I can't really hear
what you're saying,

10:34.534 --> 10:36.003
but thank-- thank you.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.809
Nice to meet you.

10:45.545 --> 10:48.448
(car starting)

10:48.481 --> 10:49.917
(engine revving)

10:53.486 --> 10:55.622
(horn honking)

10:55.655 --> 10:56.857
Come on.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.993
Excuse me?

11:00.027 --> 11:02.730
Come on.

11:02.763 --> 11:06.900
**

11:12.840 --> 11:15.342
(engine revving)

11:17.044 --> 11:21.048
(woman singing in French)

11:29.222 --> 11:30.724
(engine revving)

11:36.930 --> 11:38.665
What's your name?

11:38.698 --> 11:39.867
What?!

11:40.901 --> 11:43.236
What's your name?!

11:47.875 --> 11:49.977
I like your hair!

11:51.311 --> 11:52.712
Thank you, thanks.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.750
Thank you.

11:56.784 --> 11:58.185
(imitating Elvis)
Thank you very much, thank you.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.821
(laughing)

12:05.125 --> 12:06.760
(engine revving)

12:06.794 --> 12:09.396
(man and woman
singing in French)

12:24.845 --> 12:26.413
Is this your house?

12:29.416 --> 12:31.084
(Louie)
Should I--

12:31.118 --> 12:33.286
Excuse me?

12:33.320 --> 12:34.754
Excuse--

12:38.859 --> 12:42.462
Oh, my God, what
a beautiful night!

12:42.495 --> 12:45.899
(Louie)
Isn't it always
beautiful here?

12:45.933 --> 12:49.669
Yes, but I never notice,
I hate it here.

12:49.702 --> 12:51.671
Tonight, I love it!

12:51.704 --> 12:53.540
Because I'm laughing.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.813
Whoo!

12:59.847 --> 13:01.048
Wait, don't--

13:02.449 --> 13:03.616
Whoo!

13:22.169 --> 13:23.636
(exhaling)

13:23.670 --> 13:26.173
Come on,
let's go inside.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.483
(exhaling)

13:36.516 --> 13:37.817
Ah.

13:37.851 --> 13:38.818
(shoes squeaking)

13:38.852 --> 13:40.587
(Louie)
Sorry.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.560
Uh.

13:47.594 --> 13:50.797
(chuckling)

13:50.830 --> 13:53.300
Is this your house?

13:53.333 --> 13:55.168
This is cra--
this is crazy.

13:55.202 --> 13:57.037
I know. (chuckling)

13:58.338 --> 14:00.073
(exhaling)

14:00.107 --> 14:02.175
Is that your father?

14:02.209 --> 14:03.476
Yeah... (chuckling)

14:03.510 --> 14:05.712
He walked on the moon.

14:05.745 --> 14:07.247
(clearing throat)

14:07.280 --> 14:11.584
(deep voice)
He, uh, he walked on the moon.
Oh.

14:11.618 --> 14:12.819
(chuckling)

14:12.852 --> 14:14.554
Well, so what--
then what did he do?

14:14.587 --> 14:16.223
(laughing)

14:16.256 --> 14:17.657
Exactly.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.160
(laughing)

14:20.193 --> 14:21.394
(exhaling)

14:25.032 --> 14:27.034
(nervous cough)

14:27.067 --> 14:29.869
You're, uh,
just wearing underwear.

14:29.903 --> 14:31.504
I mean, you don't
have any--

14:31.538 --> 14:32.839
Can you tell me
where the towels are

14:32.872 --> 14:35.175
so I could get you--

14:35.208 --> 14:36.176
A towel?

14:36.209 --> 14:37.810
Mm.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.414
Do you want me to--

14:45.152 --> 14:46.686
Um...

14:46.719 --> 14:48.521
Just--

14:48.555 --> 14:49.923
I think you should--
you could put some...

14:49.957 --> 14:53.927
You could just...
please let me...

14:53.961 --> 14:56.129
Just-- okay, I...

14:57.965 --> 15:00.467
I'm just surprised.

15:00.500 --> 15:04.271
**

15:13.813 --> 15:15.248
Are you okay?

15:15.282 --> 15:16.716
Yeah.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.752
Yeah, no,
I guess-- yes.

15:19.786 --> 15:21.154
Very okay.

15:21.188 --> 15:23.323
This is, okay-- yes.

15:23.356 --> 15:24.657
(chuckling)

15:24.691 --> 15:26.326
I just don't--
you know, the thing is,

15:26.359 --> 15:29.396
I don't generally...

15:29.429 --> 15:32.799
do the whole--
I mean, it's not--

15:32.832 --> 15:35.635
(chuckling)

15:35.668 --> 15:39.973
Just like a very beautiful
astronaut's daughter...

15:40.007 --> 15:41.308
Model.

15:41.341 --> 15:44.077
Model, okay, let's
throw that in there.

15:44.111 --> 15:46.980
Model...

15:47.014 --> 15:50.283
Kind of people,
type of person,

15:50.317 --> 15:54.988
doesn't usually take me
home and have sex with me.

15:55.022 --> 15:57.790
It's not my usual--
it's not how I roll.

15:57.824 --> 15:59.759
Um-hmm.

15:59.792 --> 16:03.130
Well, maybe it's
not really happening.

16:03.163 --> 16:05.532
(chuckling)

16:05.565 --> 16:07.934
You're very weird,
you're very weird.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.202
What, you make me laugh.

16:09.236 --> 16:10.203
I don't think you
appreciate

16:10.237 --> 16:12.272
how gold that is.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.007
Well, if everybody
I made laughed at this,

16:14.041 --> 16:15.808
then my penis would
be sore all the time.

16:15.842 --> 16:17.210
(laughing)

16:17.244 --> 16:19.446
I would have-- I would need
skrin-- skin grafts.

16:19.479 --> 16:20.647
(laughing)

16:20.680 --> 16:24.151
I would need to
exfoliate... often.

16:24.184 --> 16:26.053
(laughing)

16:26.086 --> 16:32.025
And I'd need a whole regimen of
penis overuse, um, therapy.

16:32.059 --> 16:34.327
(laughing)

16:34.361 --> 16:36.163
What makes you laugh?

16:36.196 --> 16:38.865
Me, what makes me laugh?

16:38.898 --> 16:40.833
Um...

16:40.867 --> 16:42.402
I can't remember.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.137
You don't look like
you laugh a lot.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.539
I don't?

16:46.573 --> 16:47.740
I wonder if I could
make you laugh

16:47.774 --> 16:49.376
the way that
you do for me.

16:49.409 --> 16:51.878
That would be nice.

16:51.911 --> 16:54.681
What if I...
tickle you.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.216
Don't-don't-
don't-don't.

16:56.249 --> 16:57.850
Don't, don't.
Oh, someone's ticklish.

16:57.884 --> 16:59.586
Stop it,
please stop it.
Oh, you're gonna get it.

16:59.619 --> 17:00.987
Please, stop it,
please, stop it.
Oh, you're gonna get it.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.055
Please, stop it,
I'm being serious.

17:02.089 --> 17:03.156
I'm being
really serious.

17:03.190 --> 17:04.891
Please, stop it.

17:04.924 --> 17:06.426
Please don't do that,
that's upsetting, I'm not--

17:06.459 --> 17:07.427
(woman laughing)

17:07.460 --> 17:08.961
Don't!
(loud thwack)

17:16.035 --> 17:18.571
(siren blaring)

17:24.977 --> 17:26.546
Can you help me?

17:26.579 --> 17:28.348
So you went home with a girl
from the benefit.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.016
You had sex with her.

17:30.049 --> 17:33.386
You punched her
in the face

17:33.420 --> 17:35.188
and now she's
in the hospital.

17:35.222 --> 17:38.958
Yeah, now the police
are here.

17:38.991 --> 17:41.294
And now you're calling me.

17:41.328 --> 17:43.896
Well, I thought, maybe
you could come by because, uh,

17:43.930 --> 17:46.933
I know that you're...
you're here.

17:46.966 --> 17:49.302
Can you come,
can you come here?

17:49.336 --> 17:51.104
Louie, tell yourself the story
where I come down there

17:51.138 --> 17:52.639
and get in
the middle of that.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.707
Where I show my face

17:54.741 --> 17:56.709
and say, "Hey, you know
the guy who punched the girl,

17:56.743 --> 17:58.077
"who's now in
critical condition,

17:58.111 --> 18:00.480
he's with me, just so
you know."

18:00.513 --> 18:02.249
Is that story working?

18:02.282 --> 18:04.050
No.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.453
Oh, Louie, why--
why did you hit her?

18:06.486 --> 18:08.321
She was tickling me.

18:08.355 --> 18:09.789
Oh, right.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.090
Okay, here's
what I'm gonna do.

18:11.124 --> 18:12.459
I'm gonna give you
a phone number.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.494
Call this guy,
don't talk to me, Louie

18:14.527 --> 18:15.495
'cause I can't hear you.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.130
He's a lawyer.

18:17.164 --> 18:18.431
Talk to him.

18:18.465 --> 18:19.966
Okay.

18:19.999 --> 18:22.235
Where is this guy?

18:22.269 --> 18:23.236
That guy?

18:23.270 --> 18:24.671
Oh, shit.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.142
Hey, listen, I didn't--

18:29.176 --> 18:30.910
Son of a--

18:30.943 --> 18:32.312
(man) Hey, hey, take it easy.
(man)
Don't do it.

18:32.345 --> 18:33.580
Don't do it,
don't do it.

18:33.613 --> 18:34.681
Cuff him.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.183
Put your hands
on my daughter.

18:36.216 --> 18:37.850
Take it easy,
relax already.

18:37.884 --> 18:40.487
(man)
You're cuffing me,
cuff him!

18:40.520 --> 18:42.289
Ah.

18:42.322 --> 18:43.390
Let's go.

18:48.861 --> 18:50.363
(door opening)

18:54.801 --> 18:56.969
Okay.

18:57.003 --> 18:58.305
Here's where we are.

18:58.338 --> 19:01.107
First, can I-- can
I just ask you,

19:01.140 --> 19:03.710
um, how is she,
I mean, is she okay?

19:03.743 --> 19:05.144
Nobody will tell me.

19:05.178 --> 19:06.346
The girl, I don't
know how--

19:06.379 --> 19:07.814
Blake?

19:07.847 --> 19:11.218
Yeah.
She's gonna be okay.

19:11.251 --> 19:13.953
Generally,
uh, I mean,

19:13.986 --> 19:16.055
she has some serious
damage to her eye.

19:16.088 --> 19:17.357
Oh, Jesus.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.826
Like some permanent damage.
to her vision.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.828
Oh, God.

19:21.861 --> 19:24.497
And her pupil
is paralyzed.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.834
Oh, my God.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.068
And she's a
professional model so,

19:29.101 --> 19:30.370
that's not good.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.539
Oh, my God.

19:32.572 --> 19:34.507
Okay. (clearing throat)

19:34.541 --> 19:35.842
Okay, well,
here's the deal.

19:35.875 --> 19:39.646
Her family, they're
very upset, and...

19:39.679 --> 19:42.315
These are not
people you wanna upset.

19:42.349 --> 19:43.816
Yeah, I know.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.718
Oh, your nose is nothing.

19:45.752 --> 19:49.522
These people are very, um,
let me put it this way.

19:52.225 --> 19:53.660
Nobody knows
you're here right now

19:53.693 --> 19:54.827
and nobody knows
what happened,

19:54.861 --> 19:57.930
and they wanna
keep it that way.

19:57.964 --> 20:02.269
Okay.
So you're not, at this
time, being charged.

20:02.302 --> 20:06.172
Okay.
But that's up to
them to keep it that way.

20:06.205 --> 20:09.909
They're not gonna let you walk
out of here without some...

20:09.942 --> 20:13.413
they want compensation
for damages.

20:13.446 --> 20:16.383
They-- they wanna sue me?

20:16.416 --> 20:19.386
They want compensation.

20:19.419 --> 20:21.954
Well, they're-- I mean,
they're rich

20:21.988 --> 20:25.258
and I don't have
anything so what...

20:25.292 --> 20:26.759
It's not that simple.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.961
See, people are under
the misconception

20:28.995 --> 20:31.264
that the rich
can't sue the poor.

20:31.298 --> 20:34.467
They can, they want
you to pay.

20:34.501 --> 20:35.468
How much?

20:35.502 --> 20:36.903
They're asking for ten.

20:36.936 --> 20:39.272
I think we can get
them to five.

20:39.306 --> 20:40.273
Five?

20:40.307 --> 20:41.974
Million.

20:44.811 --> 20:47.647
I-- I don't have that,
I don't have--

20:47.680 --> 20:51.584
I'll never
have that so...

20:51.618 --> 20:53.553
You're gonna be
making payments to them.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.121
Payments?

20:55.154 --> 20:58.625
I believe I can get them to
agree to 5,000 per month.

20:58.658 --> 21:00.760
5,000?

21:00.793 --> 21:02.562
But how is this--
how is this possible?

21:02.595 --> 21:03.963
This was an accident.

21:03.996 --> 21:06.799
If we took this to
trial with the lawyers

21:06.833 --> 21:08.167
and the influence
that they have,

21:08.200 --> 21:09.502
it would be easy to imagine

21:09.536 --> 21:11.771
a case of
criminal negligence.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.172
How?

21:13.205 --> 21:15.508
You were naked in a bed
with a stranger.

21:15.542 --> 21:17.344
You took that
responsibility.

21:17.377 --> 21:18.778
People do that.

21:18.811 --> 21:20.112
You didn't know this person
and yet you were

21:20.146 --> 21:22.949
as intimate with her
as if she was your wife.

21:22.982 --> 21:24.617
And you didn't
know her name,

21:24.651 --> 21:27.587
and she didn't know that you
were violently ticklish.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.423
I'm just telling you
where this is headed.

21:30.457 --> 21:31.991
Wait a minute,
because this is--

21:32.024 --> 21:33.793
she was there, too.

21:33.826 --> 21:37.163
I mean, she did-- she made
the same choice to do it so

21:37.196 --> 21:40.266
she's at least 50
percent responsible.

21:40.299 --> 21:43.135
Which is why I think I can get
it to five million.

21:47.139 --> 21:50.877
**

21:54.514 --> 21:55.848
That is the worst story

21:55.882 --> 21:58.518
I've ever heard
in my entire life.

21:58.551 --> 22:00.787
Oh, my God.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.555
Oh, my God.

22:02.589 --> 22:05.224
(laughing)
Oh, my God!

22:10.597 --> 22:13.800
So you have to pay her--
you have to pay them $5,000

22:13.833 --> 22:16.636
for the rest of
your life?

22:16.669 --> 22:19.372
(laughing)

22:24.377 --> 22:25.344
Oh, my God.

22:25.378 --> 22:27.547
(clearing throat)

22:27.580 --> 22:29.148
Do you want
a drink?

22:29.181 --> 22:30.750
Yeah, sure.

22:30.783 --> 22:31.884
All right, don't
go anywhere,

22:31.918 --> 22:33.753
I'm gonna get us
a drink, okay?

22:33.786 --> 22:35.488
Okay.
All right.

22:35.522 --> 22:36.489
I'll be
right back, okay.

22:36.523 --> 22:38.891
Okay.

22:38.925 --> 22:42.529
(woman singing in French)

23:05.418 --> 23:07.554
**

23:07.587 --> 23:09.155
(record scratching)

23:10.757 --> 23:12.324
**

23:13.325 --> 23:14.627
