WEBVTT

00:21.271 --> 00:23.523
Oh, I believe we've arrived.

00:23.606 --> 00:25.358
Oh, Paris.

00:25.442 --> 00:27.152
Oh.

00:29.654 --> 00:31.197
Oh, and it feels just the same.

00:31.281 --> 00:32.531
It's been waiting for us.

00:33.992 --> 00:36.870
I told Jean
I prefer never to look back,

00:36.953 --> 00:38.204
but that's not entirely true,

00:38.288 --> 00:40.165
not when the past
looks like this.

00:40.248 --> 00:43.752
I was an embryo here,
just getting started.

00:43.835 --> 00:46.254
But you have a legacy, Paul.

00:46.338 --> 00:48.506
You left a mark.

00:48.590 --> 00:49.674
Two days.

00:49.758 --> 00:50.759
Just the two of us.

01:06.608 --> 01:08.026
- Hmm?
- Go on and check us in.

01:08.109 --> 01:10.987
I'll, uh--
I'll handle this scoundrel.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.073
- Don't hurt him too much.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.252
- Bonjour.
- Oh, bonjour.

01:26.336 --> 01:28.129
Julia.

01:28.213 --> 01:30.423
- Julia!
- Avis!

01:30.507 --> 01:31.549
Oh.
They told me

01:31.633 --> 01:33.218
your train from Nice
had a slight delay.

01:33.301 --> 01:34.678
But you're right on schedule.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.596
Yes, we made up time.

01:37.764 --> 01:38.932
What are you doing here?

01:39.015 --> 01:40.350
- You invited me.
- I did?

01:40.433 --> 01:41.559
Yes.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.269
You wrote, "You must
come to France."

01:43.353 --> 01:44.270
So I did.

01:44.354 --> 01:46.606
Well, that's just
a thing people say.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.066
I've made friends
with the front desk clerk.

01:48.149 --> 01:49.275
He's a lovely guy.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.777
Long story short,
we have adjoining rooms.

01:52.862 --> 01:54.030
Oh.

01:59.411 --> 02:00.620
You all right, Paul?

02:00.704 --> 02:02.080
Oh, I'm great.

02:02.163 --> 02:03.498
I've really missed this.

02:03.581 --> 02:05.834
Can you believe it?

02:05.917 --> 02:07.168
Paris.

02:07.252 --> 02:09.003
I'm going to be a flaneur again
for two straight days.

02:09.086 --> 02:09.963
You?

02:10.045 --> 02:12.340
No flaneusing for me, alas.

02:12.424 --> 02:13.633
I wish.

02:13.717 --> 02:16.469
I have an Alp's worth
of work in my briefcase.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.430
I'm allowing myself
one lunch

02:18.513 --> 02:20.015
with an old pal I used to edit.

02:20.098 --> 02:21.016
Anyone I know?

02:22.100 --> 02:23.393
- Ooh.
- Hmm.

02:31.026 --> 02:34.612
I'm just getting
some fresh air, mon chéri.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.698
Save some for me.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.199
Oh, I thought
you'd never come.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.828
- Champagne?
- Oh, darling.

02:41.911 --> 02:43.704
You shouldn't have.

02:43.788 --> 02:45.165
To gay Paris.

02:45.248 --> 02:48.001
To gay Paris.

02:48.084 --> 02:49.127
Mm.

02:49.210 --> 02:51.588
Let's really go to town,
as they say.

02:51.671 --> 02:52.714
Indulge.

02:52.797 --> 02:53.840
Forget our troubles.

02:53.923 --> 02:55.716
Come on, get happy.

02:55.800 --> 02:56.885
The thing is, Avis--

02:56.968 --> 02:59.179
- Julie!
- Paul--

02:59.262 --> 03:01.389
be back in a flash.

03:09.397 --> 03:10.774
Oh.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.529
Where should we go first?

03:16.613 --> 03:18.615
Jeu de Paume?
L'Orangerie?

03:18.698 --> 03:20.200
No museums.

03:20.283 --> 03:21.409
No museums?

03:21.493 --> 03:22.911
No.
I think I'd rather be

03:22.994 --> 03:25.954
a tourist of our past
this time.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.123
Poet.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.458
So much has changed.

03:28.541 --> 03:30.669
Even in these last few months
with Simca,

03:30.752 --> 03:33.713
I sometimes feel like
I'm losing track of who I am.

03:33.797 --> 03:35.131
Hmm.

03:35.215 --> 03:39.219
Maybe if we went back
to where it all started--

03:39.302 --> 03:41.388
to Le Cordon Bleu.

03:42.514 --> 03:44.307
I see it.

03:44.391 --> 03:47.352
I may even have
some surprises up my sleeve.

03:47.435 --> 03:50.021
- And down my pants.
- Ha!

03:50.105 --> 03:53.316
I'll call to tell them.
Then we can be on our way.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.027
You hold that thought,
Paulski.

03:56.111 --> 03:58.863
You've made me all
hot and bothered.

03:58.947 --> 04:01.449
I may just need
to air out the merchandise.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.830
You were saying?

04:06.913 --> 04:08.498
Cigarette?

04:08.581 --> 04:10.959
Oh, I shouldn't.

04:11.042 --> 04:14.004
Well, just a puff
for old times' sake.

04:17.339 --> 04:19.426
- Were you smoking?
- No.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.302
You know I don't smoke alone.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.138
Or--or drink alone.

04:23.221 --> 04:24.681
Yet.

04:24.764 --> 04:28.351
No, it's
just the aroma of Paris.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.728
I'm running away.

04:29.811 --> 04:32.022
How fabulous.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.857
From what?

04:33.940 --> 04:36.317
I know we're running away,
but so what?

04:36.401 --> 04:39.237
Let's embrace
our final weekend in the past,

04:39.320 --> 04:41.322
before we are thrust
back into the hustle

04:41.406 --> 04:42.824
and bustle of the present.

04:42.907 --> 04:45.368
None of that
until the plane lands.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.911
- Okay, kitten?
- Hmm?

04:48.329 --> 04:50.040
It's a little warm
for hot chocolate.

04:50.123 --> 04:53.293
But oh, shit, it's legendary.

04:53.376 --> 04:56.421
And it's not like I'm coming
back when the weather turns.

04:56.504 --> 05:00.842
The thing is, Avis,
dear, Paul has--oh.

05:00.925 --> 05:03.470
Don't be alarmed, Julia,
but there's a tiny woman

05:03.553 --> 05:04.596
on the next balcony

05:04.679 --> 05:05.847
who bears
a striking resemblance

05:05.930 --> 05:08.183
to a lush we sometimes
entertain in Cambridge.

05:08.266 --> 05:09.476
You don't say.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.519
Well, the jig is up.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.646
The thing is, Avis, dear,

05:13.730 --> 05:16.900
Paul is planning a
rather remarkable romantic trip

05:16.983 --> 05:19.277
down Memory Lane
for us this weekend.

05:21.613 --> 05:23.365
Well, why
didn't you just say so?

05:23.448 --> 05:25.408
Well, because you came
all this way

05:25.492 --> 05:28.119
based on my rhetorical
invitation.

05:28.203 --> 05:29.704
I am perfectly capable

05:29.788 --> 05:32.415
of entertaining myself
in Paris.

05:32.499 --> 05:33.667
And you don't mind?

05:33.750 --> 05:36.044
Mind?
I insist.

05:36.127 --> 05:38.463
Just not too romantic.

05:39.714 --> 05:41.383
We share a wall.

05:50.225 --> 05:51.558
Sorry I'm late.

05:51.643 --> 05:52.811
Oh, no need.
No need.

05:52.894 --> 05:55.313
You're here for the big news.

05:55.397 --> 05:57.732
Now, gentlemen, as we all know,

05:57.816 --> 06:00.026
things can't continue
the way they've been going.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.569
As much as I hem and haw

06:01.653 --> 06:03.571
about fresh ideas
and new content,

06:03.655 --> 06:06.991
I need to put my money
where my mouth is.

06:07.075 --> 06:09.119
I've made
the difficult decision

06:09.202 --> 06:12.455
to cancel "I've Been Reading."

06:12.539 --> 06:13.915
This is their doing.

06:13.998 --> 06:16.209
Hunter, I know
his audience is limited,

06:16.292 --> 06:17.961
but as a non-reader,

06:18.044 --> 06:20.463
I have learned
so much from "Reading."

06:20.547 --> 06:23.091
The show, not actually reading.

06:24.676 --> 06:27.053
Don't succumb
to a female agenda.

06:27.137 --> 06:29.931
I appreciate that, uh, Roman,

06:30.015 --> 06:32.683
but this has nothing to do
with those ladies.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.310
I'd save it if I could.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.937
I've racked my head
against the wall

06:36.021 --> 06:38.023
trying to figure out how.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.441
If I may?

06:39.524 --> 06:41.776
I--I just think you need
to try some noisier guests.

06:41.860 --> 06:42.986
Controversial.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.070
Provocative.

06:44.154 --> 06:45.196
Dangerous, even.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.781
Like who?

06:46.865 --> 06:49.075
Off the top of my head,
I don't know--

06:49.159 --> 06:51.828
Helen Gurley Brown,
"Sex and the Single Girl."

06:51.911 --> 06:53.705
See if he can step up
to the times.

06:53.788 --> 06:56.582
Albert and
"Sex and the Single Girl"?

06:56.666 --> 07:00.420
I, for one, have never
been a sexual single girl.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.672
I've barely been
a sexual married man.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.383
I can't speak to the content.

07:05.467 --> 07:07.093
Alice?

07:07.177 --> 07:08.094
Hmm?
What?

07:08.178 --> 07:10.805
You're single, right?

07:10.889 --> 07:13.350
What--what do you mean?

07:13.433 --> 07:15.560
Is sex interesting to you?

07:21.232 --> 07:22.442
I gotta pee.

07:24.569 --> 07:25.904
Lovely.

07:25.987 --> 07:29.032
Um, doesn't exactly
instill confidence.

07:31.910 --> 07:32.952
Oh! Jeez.

07:33.036 --> 07:34.287
- Oh.
- Oh, sorry.

07:34.371 --> 07:35.372
That's all right.
It's all right.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.123
Sorry.
Oh, hey, Russ.

07:37.207 --> 07:40.210
Um, seeing as Hunter
sort of wants new ideas from us

07:40.293 --> 07:41.711
yesterday, I was wondering

07:41.795 --> 07:42.712
if you could spare
a few minutes

07:42.796 --> 07:43.880
to spitball with me.

07:43.963 --> 07:46.216
Spitball?
I love the TV lingo, pal.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.884
Did Elaine teach you that?

07:47.967 --> 07:48.885
But no can do.

07:48.968 --> 07:51.012
I've got an anti-war movement
to spotlight.

07:51.096 --> 07:52.305
I'm actually meeting
some members

07:52.389 --> 07:53.932
of the Socialist Party
of America.

07:54.015 --> 07:55.725
Socialism.
Radical.

07:55.808 --> 07:57.018
Day one of pilot filming.

07:57.102 --> 07:59.187
The great work begins.

07:59.270 --> 08:01.189
Well, good luck.

08:01.272 --> 08:02.440
Are you okay?

08:02.524 --> 08:05.276
Me?
Why do you--why do you ask?

08:05.360 --> 08:08.196
You're looking
a little sweaty.

08:08.279 --> 08:09.280
Are you feeling all right?

08:09.364 --> 08:10.490
- Oh.
- Oh.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.617
No, no, no.
Let me try that again.

08:12.701 --> 08:14.869
Marian tells me women
don't appreciate

08:14.953 --> 08:17.038
those kinds of observations.

08:17.122 --> 08:18.415
She definitely doesn't.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.875
Ixnay on the weatsay.

08:20.959 --> 08:23.003
More like a glow.

08:23.086 --> 08:24.713
A misty glow.

08:24.796 --> 08:26.423
You're glowing, Alice.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.390
Julia?

08:45.400 --> 08:47.777
Oh, Monsieur Bugnard.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.071
Monsieur Bugnard.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.554
But it's true.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.597
It's all meaningless.

10:39.681 --> 10:41.182
You can't stop, Jean-Paul.

10:41.266 --> 10:42.392
You can't stop writing.

10:42.475 --> 10:45.145
Why?
What's the point?

10:45.228 --> 10:47.814
I understand that
just like any writer,

10:47.897 --> 10:50.316
I'm doomed to tell
the same story

10:50.400 --> 10:51.526
until the day I die.

10:51.609 --> 10:53.486
But having that knowledge?

10:53.570 --> 10:58.700
It just makes it, uh,
not only futile, but petty.

10:58.783 --> 10:59.743
Okay.

10:59.826 --> 11:00.827
You're bringing me down, JP.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.287
I have one day in Paris.

11:02.370 --> 11:07.167
I wanna be inspired,
rekindled, awed.

11:07.250 --> 11:08.376
Try Camus.

11:08.460 --> 11:09.419
Maybe he's in town.

11:09.502 --> 11:10.795
How can you be so flip?

11:10.879 --> 11:12.589
This is your life's work.

11:12.672 --> 11:16.217
And for whatever it's worth,
this is my life's work, too.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.595
And you telling me
my life is meaningless

11:18.678 --> 11:21.222
is, frankly, pissing me off.

11:21.306 --> 11:23.016
Well, I'm sorry
it's pissing you off,

11:23.099 --> 11:25.060
but that does not make it
less true.

11:25.143 --> 11:26.269
Open your eyes.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.646
All that survives is crap.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.190
The Bible--garbage.

11:30.273 --> 11:32.567
It does not even hold up
dramaturgically.

11:32.650 --> 11:36.237
Shakespeare--incomprehensible,
sentimental tripe.

11:36.321 --> 11:37.238
Enough.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.491
Another word on the subject,
and I'm leaving.

11:39.574 --> 11:41.534
I didn't come all the way here
to get a lecture.

11:43.828 --> 11:48.625
Maybe Bugs Bunny--
he has insight.

11:48.708 --> 11:52.128
Apart from that,
I'm drawing a blank.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.755
A Mel Blanc.

11:55.674 --> 11:58.510
This place has a really nice
junior high school vibe.

11:58.593 --> 12:01.930
I hadn't thought of myself
as having cooties in 20 years.

12:02.013 --> 12:03.973
Julia talks about
a confederacy of women,

12:04.057 --> 12:05.725
although I'm pretty sure
she meant a sisterhood

12:05.809 --> 12:07.268
and not a traitorous army.

12:07.352 --> 12:09.270
Well, whatever she meant,
we really need her back.

12:09.354 --> 12:11.523
I mean, we need reinforcements.

12:11.606 --> 12:12.899
I have an idea for a show.

12:12.982 --> 12:14.484
For our female audience--

12:14.567 --> 12:16.986
Julia's audience--
as per Hunter's instructions.

12:17.070 --> 12:21.074
This is why I said yes when
you asked me to take this job.

12:21.157 --> 12:22.951
Okay.

12:27.330 --> 12:28.915
Maybe we should take
our brainstorming session

12:28.998 --> 12:30.041
someplace else.

12:30.125 --> 12:31.126
Dinner tomorrow night?

12:31.209 --> 12:32.752
Yes. You're on.

12:32.836 --> 12:36.256
I know a mediocre diner
I can afford on my GBH salary.

12:36.339 --> 12:37.590
Breakfast all day.

12:37.674 --> 12:38.758
Oh. How are the eggs?

12:38.842 --> 12:40.635
Greasy and great.

12:40.719 --> 12:41.803
I'm so sorry.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.555
Will you excuse me
for a minute?

12:52.939 --> 12:54.024
No.

12:54.107 --> 12:57.986
No.
You are not pregnant.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.701
Editing my translations,

13:04.784 --> 13:06.745
you always had such confidence

13:06.828 --> 13:08.747
in how they would be received
in English.

13:08.830 --> 13:10.623
You and Camus.

13:10.707 --> 13:13.501
I was still a kid, practically.

13:13.585 --> 13:16.963
Playing masterpiece sandbox,
immersing myself,

13:17.047 --> 13:19.883
working like a dog
with you two nutcases.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.801
I don't know where I found
the confidence.

13:21.885 --> 13:24.262
I remember you were having
an affair

13:24.346 --> 13:27.432
with that fat, boring,
married American.

13:27.515 --> 13:30.935
That fat, boring, married
American is now my husband.

13:31.019 --> 13:32.771
Ah.

13:32.854 --> 13:33.980
Americans.

13:34.064 --> 13:37.108
They can make anything Puritan,
even their affairs.

13:37.192 --> 13:39.652
So devoted
to their mistakes.

13:39.736 --> 13:40.653
You know what?

13:40.737 --> 13:41.696
I think I'm done.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.536
Fancy seeing you here.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.705
Likewise.

13:50.789 --> 13:55.919
Oh, you have a little
hot chocolate mustache.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.462
So do you.

14:00.131 --> 14:02.509
Avis DeVoto,
Jean-Paul Sartre.

14:02.592 --> 14:03.510
Oh.

14:03.593 --> 14:04.969
Enchanté, madame.

14:05.053 --> 14:07.305
Hello.

14:07.389 --> 14:09.724
I actually have to get
back to the hotel.

14:09.808 --> 14:11.059
Oh.

14:11.142 --> 14:12.769
Yeah, I'm desperately behind
with work.

14:12.852 --> 14:16.356
I was hoping our time together
would inspire me

14:16.439 --> 14:18.983
to dive in with newfound vigor.

14:19.067 --> 14:20.694
Oh, well.

14:20.777 --> 14:23.113
I'm waiting
for the next piece, JP.

14:23.196 --> 14:26.116
I do not accept this extension
of your philosophy.

14:27.409 --> 14:29.828
If nothing else, write it down.

14:32.038 --> 14:35.750
Well, uh, it was nice
meeting you.

14:35.834 --> 14:38.503
Oh, don't leave me all alone.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.672
I'll kill myself.

14:40.755 --> 14:43.675
I'm so fucking depressed.

14:43.758 --> 14:46.094
Me too.

14:46.177 --> 14:47.595
He wanted to come in.

14:47.679 --> 14:49.347
Why did you not let him?

14:49.431 --> 14:51.725
To take off your clothes
with another person

14:51.808 --> 14:53.935
is one of life's
only real pleasures,

14:54.019 --> 14:57.981
even if you're as old
and saggy as we are.

14:58.064 --> 15:00.316
It's a butterflies problem.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.818
I don't have them.

15:01.901 --> 15:05.780
With Bernard, my husband,
I always had them.

15:05.864 --> 15:07.657
But he is dead, no?

15:07.741 --> 15:08.700
Yes.

15:08.783 --> 15:10.118
I don't understand.

15:10.201 --> 15:13.204
Stanley is not a replacement
for your husband,

15:13.288 --> 15:14.748
but for loneliness.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.374
Hmm.
Maybe.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.001
It's funny.
You're upset

15:18.084 --> 15:20.337
because Stanley
gives you too much attention.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.213
Try getting too little.

15:22.297 --> 15:24.758
When I come home,
will Simone be there?

15:24.841 --> 15:25.884
I'm guessing no?

15:25.967 --> 15:28.011
I probably won't see her
until morning,

15:28.094 --> 15:29.429
if I'm lucky.

15:29.512 --> 15:32.098
But that's l'amour.

15:32.182 --> 15:34.851
There is always one
who loves the other more.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.437
It's never equal.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.439
My marriage was equal.

15:39.522 --> 15:42.901
I guess you achieved what
Romeo and Juliet could not.

15:42.984 --> 15:44.778
I guess so.

15:44.861 --> 15:48.114
What happened
when your husband took a lover?

15:48.198 --> 15:49.366
He never took a lover.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.785
Well, what about
when you took a lover?

15:51.868 --> 15:53.870
I never took a lover.

15:55.038 --> 15:56.664
C'est impossible.

16:15.433 --> 16:17.268
Aren't they all marvelous,
Julia?

16:17.352 --> 16:18.561
Oh, they are.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.814
Only at Le Cordon Bleu.

16:20.897 --> 16:21.856
Oui.

16:29.447 --> 16:30.448
Oh!

16:50.176 --> 16:51.136
Bon soir.

16:51.219 --> 16:52.178
Bon soir, madame.

16:52.262 --> 16:53.722
I hope you had a pleasant day.

16:53.805 --> 16:55.473
You've obviously never spent
an afternoon

16:55.557 --> 16:57.225
with an existentialist.

16:57.308 --> 16:58.518
Oh.

16:58.601 --> 17:00.603
You have a number of messages.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.105
Oh, look at me.

17:02.188 --> 17:03.982
How popular am I?

17:04.065 --> 17:05.858
They're all coming
from the same person.

17:05.942 --> 17:07.986
Someone named Blanche.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.445
Read them to me.
I can't bear it.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.573
All right.

17:11.656 --> 17:14.742
"I need an update on
the Sylvia Plath estate now!"

17:14.826 --> 17:16.077
There is an exclamation point.

17:17.662 --> 17:18.704
"Where are you?

17:18.788 --> 17:20.790
I thought you were
coming home today."

17:20.874 --> 17:22.416
"I call you at your hotel.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.377
Where are you?"

17:24.461 --> 17:28.089
"People don't answer
their phone in Paris, huh?"

17:28.173 --> 17:30.425
"Your assistant knows nothing."

17:32.761 --> 17:34.262
"I fire your assistant!"

17:34.346 --> 17:36.264
Exclamation point again.

17:36.348 --> 17:37.849
And--

17:41.227 --> 17:44.731
I'll be working in my room
this evening, and ordering in.

17:44.814 --> 17:46.858
- No calls.
- Bien.

17:46.941 --> 17:48.109
Merci.

17:51.613 --> 17:53.031
Staring
at Simone's apartment,

17:53.114 --> 17:56.409
waiting for her or her lover
to emerge post-coital,

17:56.493 --> 18:00.622
doesn't seem to me to be
the best use of time, JP,

18:00.705 --> 18:02.624
even if life is meaningless.

18:02.707 --> 18:05.835
I never said life
is meaningless.

18:05.919 --> 18:08.171
You don't understand
existentialism.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.923
No, I probably don't.

18:10.006 --> 18:11.383
Shoot me.

18:11.466 --> 18:15.178
But didn't you write
"hell is other people"?

18:15.261 --> 18:17.389
Oh, you saw "No Exit"?

18:17.472 --> 18:20.350
No, I read that line
in a magazine.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.936
Then why all these extra people
in your life?

18:23.019 --> 18:25.230
Why this endless parade
of lovers

18:25.313 --> 18:27.440
that drive you crazy
with jealousy?

18:27.524 --> 18:29.859
That seems inconsistent.

18:29.943 --> 18:31.111
You think
I should be consistent?

18:31.194 --> 18:32.904
You are Jean-Paul Sartre.

18:32.987 --> 18:34.656
Is every psychiatrist sane?

18:34.739 --> 18:36.074
Oh, well, you make a point.

18:36.157 --> 18:38.034
Is every priest a saint?

18:38.118 --> 18:39.494
Now you're gloating.

18:39.577 --> 18:41.996
You expect me to live
by my own philosophy

18:42.080 --> 18:43.832
every single second?

18:43.915 --> 18:46.418
This from a woman who believes

18:46.501 --> 18:49.254
that a chance meeting
with a man at the age of 18

18:49.337 --> 18:51.381
was ordained by the universe

18:51.464 --> 18:53.675
as her only shot at happiness?

18:56.928 --> 19:00.974
It made me happy
for a long time.

19:01.057 --> 19:04.686
Isn't that good enough
for a working philosophy?

19:04.769 --> 19:06.354
You should write a book.

19:08.773 --> 19:10.191
So what's the plan?

19:10.275 --> 19:12.444
We wait all night,
if necessary.

19:12.527 --> 19:14.988
- Okay.
- What else?

19:16.364 --> 19:19.200
I know you didn't come
to Paris for me to cook a fish.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.039
No.

19:24.122 --> 19:25.623
It was a very nice fish.

19:28.501 --> 19:31.004
You're looking at me
like it's 1948,

19:31.087 --> 19:34.758
on our first night in France,
and I'm only 36 years old.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.092
No.

19:36.176 --> 19:38.178
I'm looking at you
like it's today,

19:38.261 --> 19:41.264
and I've never changed
how I felt since then.

19:46.895 --> 19:49.064
I've watched
every episode three times,

19:49.147 --> 19:51.149
and I think it's fascinating

19:51.232 --> 19:53.526
how much the show has evolved
in just one season.

19:53.610 --> 19:56.279
And I noticed that things that
were mistakes in episode one,

19:56.363 --> 19:57.864
by episode four,

19:57.947 --> 19:59.949
they were incorporated
into the rhythm of the show.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.869
No, at first Julia's mistakes
gave me angina.

20:02.952 --> 20:05.372
But I figured out
pretty quickly

20:05.455 --> 20:07.999
that the flaws were
the show's greatest strength.

20:08.083 --> 20:09.167
Never cut.

20:09.250 --> 20:10.585
Never start over.

20:10.669 --> 20:13.672
You'll miss something
distinctly Julia.

20:13.755 --> 20:18.093
Over here, it's just
a limitation of our setup.

20:18.176 --> 20:21.221
When you're shooting her moving
from the oven to the counter,

20:21.304 --> 20:23.598
it's very tough to get around
on her on camera three,

20:23.682 --> 20:26.768
so I just come very close
with camera two,

20:26.851 --> 20:29.813
and she knows by now
to cheat to camera.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.981
She's completely instinctive.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.317
Stick close by, Russ.
I'm gonna need you.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.820
As I told Julia,
I'm just down the hall.

20:36.903 --> 20:40.615
May I ask, why did you leave
in the first place?

20:42.075 --> 20:43.535
Because today I got to do
the work

20:43.618 --> 20:46.496
I've been dreaming about
my whole life.

20:46.579 --> 20:52.836
♪ I once was lost ♪

20:52.919 --> 20:58.133
♪ But now I'm found ♪

20:58.216 --> 21:02.887
♪ Was blind, but now ♪

21:02.971 --> 21:07.559
♪ I see ♪

21:09.185 --> 21:10.645
Amen.

21:10.729 --> 21:13.773
The altar is now open
for anyone to receive Jesus.

21:17.777 --> 21:21.990
Dear God, long time no see.

21:22.073 --> 21:23.700
Um, I guess you know
how desperate I am

21:23.783 --> 21:24.909
just by me being here.

21:24.993 --> 21:27.746
But I'm willing to try
anything at this point.

21:27.829 --> 21:31.041
Please, please, I beg of you--

21:31.124 --> 21:33.251
You didn't call me back
last night.

21:33.335 --> 21:36.087
Too busy for your mama,
but you have time for this?

21:36.171 --> 21:37.881
I'm dubious, to say the least.

21:37.964 --> 21:39.799
Are you actually mad
that I'm praying?

21:39.883 --> 21:41.384
Mad?
Not mad.

21:41.468 --> 21:42.427
More confused.

21:42.510 --> 21:44.346
Suspicious.
What did you do?

21:44.429 --> 21:46.431
What trouble
did you get yourself into?

21:47.390 --> 21:51.186
I--I needed inspiration
for a new show.

21:51.269 --> 21:52.479
I thought he could help.

21:52.562 --> 21:54.773
That is a waste of his time.

21:54.856 --> 21:57.984
Can we discuss this later?

21:58.068 --> 21:59.194
I'll see you
in the lobby,

21:59.277 --> 22:02.030
at which point we'll discuss
proper kneeling attire.

22:02.113 --> 22:03.281
Mother!

22:13.875 --> 22:17.337
I have missed this place.

22:17.420 --> 22:19.923
Oh!

22:20.006 --> 22:21.716
- Mmm.
- Ooh, la, la.

22:21.800 --> 22:22.842
Oh, fantastic.

22:22.926 --> 22:24.135
Oh! Oh!

22:26.054 --> 22:28.390
A toast to us.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.191
They were just shellfish!

22:43.738 --> 22:45.573
I wish you could have seen her.

22:45.657 --> 22:47.617
Le Cordon Bleu,
the great Bugnard,

22:47.701 --> 22:49.327
all in service of her vision.

22:49.411 --> 22:51.079
Well, Bocuse's vision.

22:51.162 --> 22:55.750
But still, the fish
was lighter than a feather,

22:55.834 --> 22:57.585
which I cannot
say for this duck.

22:57.669 --> 22:58.878
It's marvelous.

22:58.962 --> 23:01.172
We haven't indulged like this
since you two left.

23:01.256 --> 23:02.382
Has it been that dreary?

23:02.465 --> 23:04.634
The man who replaced you,
George Drummond--

23:04.718 --> 23:05.677
a nincompoop.

23:05.760 --> 23:07.929
Oh, now, I liked George.

23:08.013 --> 23:10.640
He was a plodder,
playing checkers to your chess.

23:10.724 --> 23:13.101
Oh, I do miss
the challenge of it.

23:13.184 --> 23:14.936
And he did not
understand French.

23:15.020 --> 23:16.312
- Oh.
- Well,

23:16.396 --> 23:19.607
I always prided myself on that.

23:19.691 --> 23:22.569
- Wow.
- Mmm.

23:22.652 --> 23:25.947
They were, I think it is fair
to say, anni mirabiles.

23:26.031 --> 23:27.282
Oh, tout a fait.

23:27.365 --> 23:28.700
The Marshall Plan.

23:28.783 --> 23:32.162
All across Europe, would there
be democracy without it?

23:32.245 --> 23:33.329
No.

23:33.413 --> 23:34.789
Here in Paris,
the work we did

23:34.873 --> 23:36.332
with the Joint
Distribution Committee

23:36.416 --> 23:39.669
for the Jews
resettling in France--

23:39.753 --> 23:42.005
returning their homes,
their businesses,

23:42.088 --> 23:46.551
their possessions, the things
they left behind in exile.

23:46.634 --> 23:49.929
I remember them all,
every face.

23:50.013 --> 23:51.514
The Rosenthals,

23:51.598 --> 23:53.600
the Wiets,
the Blochs,

23:53.683 --> 23:55.935
the Levis,
the Steiners.

23:56.019 --> 23:59.564
They became friends of ours--
uh, some of them.

23:59.647 --> 24:02.192
We gave them back their lives.

24:02.275 --> 24:03.234
Huh.

24:04.694 --> 24:06.112
And what does that mean?

24:06.196 --> 24:07.989
You know France
less well than you think.

24:08.073 --> 24:09.949
- Annette.
- No.

24:10.033 --> 24:12.160
What's the point of this?

24:12.243 --> 24:14.871
It means we do not
change the world,

24:14.954 --> 24:17.248
only who does the hurting.

24:17.332 --> 24:19.959
Leave it
as you remember, Paul.

24:20.043 --> 24:21.002
What does it matter?

24:21.086 --> 24:21.920
It matters.

24:23.588 --> 24:25.090
It was his life's work.

24:27.008 --> 24:28.510
Florent?

24:32.097 --> 24:33.556
Turns out, we--

24:33.640 --> 24:35.809
we didn't do half the things
we thought we did.

24:35.892 --> 24:37.519
No, you did them.

24:37.602 --> 24:40.897
It just didn't change anything.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.650
France doesn't change.

24:43.733 --> 24:46.361
Paul Child
or George Drummond, so what?

24:48.196 --> 24:50.865
We are who we are who we are.

25:08.466 --> 25:11.594
You are so comfortable
in your skin.

25:11.678 --> 25:13.638
Not always.

25:13.722 --> 25:15.765
But always when I move.

25:21.479 --> 25:24.441
Life is
full of amazing things.

25:26.943 --> 25:28.987
They are not all the same.

25:29.070 --> 25:31.823
You should be open
to all of them.

25:46.296 --> 25:48.715
You couldn't sleep?

25:48.798 --> 25:51.134
No.

25:51.217 --> 25:54.220
Well, we had a lot to drink.

25:54.304 --> 25:55.347
All four of us.

25:59.100 --> 26:01.311
We know what we did.

26:01.394 --> 26:03.688
I know what you did.

26:03.772 --> 26:05.482
The Rosenthals, for one.

26:05.565 --> 26:07.317
I know what we did for them.

26:07.400 --> 26:10.111
That Rembrandt.

26:10.195 --> 26:13.073
You know, Rosa was
the one with the eye.

26:14.866 --> 26:16.785
Yeah, but he was the one
with the money.

26:20.955 --> 26:22.457
It's been such
a wonderful trip

26:22.540 --> 26:24.626
in every other way.

26:24.709 --> 26:29.005
And we still have eight hours
until the plane takes off.

26:29.089 --> 26:30.006
Let's find them.

26:32.425 --> 26:33.927
I miss them now.

26:44.979 --> 26:46.606
Ugh!

27:03.039 --> 27:05.625
Evan Jones, please.

27:05.709 --> 27:07.502
The United States.

27:07.585 --> 27:10.422
That's Beekman 64541.

27:14.509 --> 27:15.677
Evan.

27:18.096 --> 27:19.639
No, I'm fine.

27:22.017 --> 27:24.644
I missed my flight.

27:24.728 --> 27:26.229
Is that okay?

27:33.278 --> 27:35.530
Oh!
Ow.

27:37.991 --> 27:39.117
What?

27:52.797 --> 27:54.049
Huh?

27:59.095 --> 28:02.265
Ow.
Oh.

28:02.349 --> 28:03.933
This isn't dangerous, Russ?

28:04.017 --> 28:05.894
They're
peaceful protests, Marian.

28:05.977 --> 28:07.354
And I'm just filming them.

28:07.437 --> 28:08.980
Yes, but socialists.

28:09.064 --> 28:11.399
Against the war,
not the government.

28:11.483 --> 28:12.942
And this is
the United States of America.

28:13.026 --> 28:14.611
You're allowed to say
what you think.

28:14.694 --> 28:16.154
Okay.

28:16.237 --> 28:18.365
They marched
to the statehouse yesterday,

28:18.448 --> 28:20.033
and I filmed it all.

28:20.116 --> 28:21.951
Some students, mostly.
Some retirees.

28:22.035 --> 28:24.245
Oh, I even interviewed
a housewife like you.

28:24.329 --> 28:25.413
How open-minded.

28:25.497 --> 28:26.831
Television is
the key, Marian.

28:26.915 --> 28:29.042
I can connect people
all across the country.

28:29.125 --> 28:31.336
Instead of 100 small protests,

28:31.419 --> 28:32.962
now they're part of a movement.

28:34.005 --> 28:34.923
Oh.

28:35.006 --> 28:36.383
Oh.
No, no, no.

28:36.466 --> 28:37.425
That's right.

28:37.509 --> 28:38.426
Make noise.

28:38.510 --> 28:40.011
Make noise, little Vicky.

28:40.095 --> 28:42.305
Your daddy's gonna change
the world.

28:42.389 --> 28:44.182
After that, maybe
a few diapers.

28:44.265 --> 28:45.600
You bet.

28:50.021 --> 28:52.065
This is something
you two cooked up?

28:52.148 --> 28:54.901
Look, if I had wanted
to expand my repertoire

28:54.984 --> 28:56.695
to include the subgenre

28:56.778 --> 28:59.406
of lightly pornographic
self-help literature,

28:59.489 --> 29:00.990
I would have let you know.

29:01.074 --> 29:02.575
I'm sorry, Albert,
but the author

29:02.659 --> 29:05.078
of "Birdwatching:
An Ornithological Diary

29:05.161 --> 29:07.038
in 30 Species" had to cancel.

29:07.122 --> 29:09.249
Let me guess.
Bad clams again?

29:09.332 --> 29:12.002
Well, last time it was--
it was Updike.

29:12.085 --> 29:13.003
And that worked out well.

29:13.086 --> 29:14.754
Surely even you
and Ms. Levitch

29:14.838 --> 29:16.673
can see the difference
between John Updike

29:16.756 --> 29:18.758
and--and Helen Gurley Brown.

29:18.842 --> 29:20.760
Oh, that can't be
her real name.

29:20.844 --> 29:23.388
Albert, as a new
and now die-hard fan

29:23.471 --> 29:24.973
of the show myself,
I'm just trying

29:25.056 --> 29:26.349
to entice a new audience.

29:26.433 --> 29:27.767
Well, what will it be
next, Levitch?

29:27.851 --> 29:29.477
I strip to my skivvies
and juggle?

29:31.271 --> 29:34.357
How am I gonna get
that visual out of my head?

29:34.441 --> 29:38.820
Now, uh, what I found tit--
titillating about your book--

29:38.903 --> 29:40.321
Why Albert, you pussycat.

29:40.405 --> 29:41.948
What did you find titillating?

29:43.491 --> 29:47.871
Uh, your focus
on financial independence.

29:47.954 --> 29:50.165
I hadn't thought
of it that way.

29:50.248 --> 29:53.543
That's--
well, that's not so terrible.

29:53.626 --> 29:55.920
Rather big of you to say.

29:56.004 --> 29:56.921
Big of me?

29:57.005 --> 29:58.715
Very big.

29:58.798 --> 30:01.384
Financial independence
and sexual freedom

30:01.468 --> 30:03.345
are inextricably intertwined.

30:03.428 --> 30:05.347
I was 37 when I got married,

30:05.430 --> 30:06.556
but you don't honestly believe

30:06.639 --> 30:08.641
I was a virgin at 37?

30:10.060 --> 30:11.353
I guess I don't.

30:11.436 --> 30:13.438
So isn't that
the truth of it?

30:13.521 --> 30:15.607
Well, young lady,
you know what they say.

30:15.690 --> 30:17.400
Good girls go to heaven.

30:17.484 --> 30:21.321
True.
But bad girls go everywhere.

30:21.404 --> 30:23.740
From the age of 20--
what the hell, 19--

30:23.823 --> 30:25.992
I explored my options sexually

30:26.076 --> 30:27.786
until I met the right partner.

30:27.869 --> 30:30.038
I had my fill
of all shapes and sizes.

30:30.121 --> 30:31.289
Good God.

30:31.373 --> 30:33.291
Having my own income allowed

30:33.375 --> 30:35.043
for some adventurous
discernment.

30:35.126 --> 30:36.711
The gift of time.

30:36.795 --> 30:38.171
Did your wife have a chance

30:38.254 --> 30:40.965
to explore
her options sexually?

30:41.049 --> 30:42.842
Well--

30:42.926 --> 30:44.094
I bet she did.

30:44.177 --> 30:45.470
She just didn't tell you.

30:45.553 --> 30:48.014
Now, it's not
your fault, professor.

30:48.098 --> 30:49.307
It's societal.

30:49.391 --> 30:51.726
And that's what my book,
and now the movie,

30:51.810 --> 30:53.895
are here to dismantle.

30:53.978 --> 30:55.480
You know, in my day,

30:55.563 --> 30:57.816
we read books
like "Anna Karenina"

30:57.899 --> 30:59.359
and "The Scarlet Letter,"

30:59.442 --> 31:02.904
and women were punished
for their sexuality.

31:04.531 --> 31:07.784
Your day has passed, old man.

31:12.664 --> 31:13.623
I have to pee.

31:15.750 --> 31:19.379
This was one of my favorite
apartments in all of Paris,

31:19.462 --> 31:21.423
and my very favorite couple.

31:21.506 --> 31:22.674
Yes.

31:26.261 --> 31:27.804
Bonjour.

31:27.887 --> 31:29.431
Uh, bonjour, mademoiselle.

31:55.123 --> 31:56.583
- Au revoir.
- Au revoir.

31:56.666 --> 31:58.209
Au revoir.

32:01.087 --> 32:01.921
Hmm.

32:30.825 --> 32:31.951
Merci.

33:20.041 --> 33:22.002
In the long dark tunnel
of night

33:22.085 --> 33:23.336
that is human existence,

33:23.420 --> 33:25.422
last night was a revelation.

33:25.505 --> 33:27.173
You mean you had a good time.

33:27.257 --> 33:29.217
I'll still never put
pen to paper again.

33:29.300 --> 33:30.844
That's useless folly.

33:30.927 --> 33:35.098
But from now on, I shall dance
whenever I can.

33:37.058 --> 33:42.939
When I got home, Simone
was so worried and jealous.

33:43.023 --> 33:45.608
Who stays out
till 3:00 a.m. at my age?

33:47.485 --> 33:49.404
We never went to sleep at all.

33:49.487 --> 33:53.867
Oh.
Well, glad I could help.

33:53.950 --> 33:56.536
Simone wants to meet you.

33:56.619 --> 33:59.497
This woman who can bring
people back from the dead.

33:59.581 --> 34:01.291
Will you join us?

34:01.374 --> 34:02.834
For lunch, dinner?

34:02.917 --> 34:07.255
Oh...
there can be dinner too.

34:08.882 --> 34:10.091
Oh.

34:10.175 --> 34:11.051
Oh!

34:14.721 --> 34:16.764
Oh, really, JP.

34:20.893 --> 34:22.645
I'm seeing someone.

34:27.150 --> 34:29.319
I still know my way
around the Paris bureaucracy

34:29.402 --> 34:30.320
as well as any man.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.405
An address for the Rosenthals.

34:33.822 --> 34:34.699
You okay, Jule?

34:36.201 --> 34:37.869
It's from Chef Bugnard.

34:37.952 --> 34:38.786
Oh.

34:40.621 --> 34:42.623
"I was so happy
to see you today, Julia,

34:42.706 --> 34:44.333
"all these years later.

34:44.417 --> 34:46.878
"Teaching you was one
of the great joys of my life,

34:46.960 --> 34:49.422
"and now you are
my teacher, too.

34:49.505 --> 34:51.257
"But I will be happy
to miss you,

34:51.341 --> 34:54.177
"because your work
is in America now.

34:54.260 --> 34:56.096
"Do not be afraid of the new.

34:56.179 --> 35:01.351
"It does not erase the past,
only build on it.

35:01.434 --> 35:03.687
"Show the world how to cook,

35:03.770 --> 35:06.731
"daughter of Escoffier,

35:06.815 --> 35:08.733
"madame ambassadress,

35:08.817 --> 35:10.777
my shining student."

35:26.793 --> 35:27.669
Hello?

35:30.130 --> 35:32.215
Oh, Mom.

35:32.298 --> 35:33.758
What--what are you doing
with those?

35:33.842 --> 35:36.302
Did you stop
ironing your sheets?

35:36.386 --> 35:39.806
I never ironed
my sheets, Mom.

35:39.889 --> 35:42.892
You know they actually last
longer if you care for them?

35:42.976 --> 35:45.478
Did you pop over here
just to tell me that?

35:45.562 --> 35:46.771
No, I came to talk to you.

35:46.855 --> 35:49.232
The sheets called out to me
from the other room.

35:49.315 --> 35:51.401
I will try to find some time
this weekend.

35:51.484 --> 35:54.946
Unless you're in church
again, I suppose.

35:55.030 --> 35:56.406
It's possible.

35:57.991 --> 35:58.825
Alice.

36:00.452 --> 36:02.037
Alice.

36:02.120 --> 36:05.874
Even if you have no one else
to talk to, you always have me.

36:05.957 --> 36:08.418
And I answer quicker than God.

36:10.211 --> 36:12.422
Can I help you with anything?

36:12.505 --> 36:13.340
No.

36:15.050 --> 36:17.552
No.
I'm just blocked at work.

36:17.635 --> 36:19.346
Well, her fangs were out.

36:19.429 --> 36:20.930
What can I say?

36:21.014 --> 36:22.766
We should never book
New Yorkers.

36:22.849 --> 36:24.142
Is that right?

36:24.225 --> 36:26.061
You know, I admit
I didn't properly prepare

36:26.144 --> 36:27.562
the way I like to.

36:27.645 --> 36:30.523
But have you read it, Hunter?

36:30.607 --> 36:32.567
"Sex and the Single Girl"?

36:32.650 --> 36:33.651
It's trash.

36:33.735 --> 36:36.237
I don't know how to help trash.

36:36.321 --> 36:38.823
But don't you realize,
Albert?

36:38.907 --> 36:40.575
She was there to help you.

36:42.535 --> 36:43.912
How do you mean?

36:43.995 --> 36:45.789
Do you want me
to spell it out for you?

36:45.872 --> 36:48.458
I understand
that times are changing.

36:48.541 --> 36:49.834
I do.

36:49.918 --> 36:51.836
I mean, it's happening
at the college, too.

36:51.920 --> 36:55.924
I recently added Willa Cather
to my syllabus, and a Bronte.

36:56.007 --> 36:57.342
Well, that's terrific.

36:57.425 --> 36:59.344
I'm sure your students
will appreciate it,

36:59.427 --> 37:02.347
especially those
of the fairer sex.

37:02.430 --> 37:04.683
It meant losing "Moby-Dick."

37:04.766 --> 37:06.935
You can't add
without subtracting.

37:08.311 --> 37:11.815
Took the words
right out of my mouth.

37:11.898 --> 37:14.275
Albert, this is not easy.

37:14.359 --> 37:16.361
I've actually had
stomach issues for days

37:16.444 --> 37:18.905
just figuring out
how to say this to you.

37:20.240 --> 37:22.617
It's not gonna work, Albert.

37:24.369 --> 37:26.705
Okay.
Invite her back.

37:26.788 --> 37:27.956
I'll do better.

37:28.039 --> 37:30.083
I'll do better this time,
I promise.

37:30.166 --> 37:31.918
You can finish out
the season,

37:32.002 --> 37:34.170
and we'll give you
a proper sendoff.

37:36.297 --> 37:40.885
You've been a vital part
of WGBH since the beginning,

37:40.969 --> 37:43.763
and for that,
I'll always be grateful.

37:47.434 --> 37:49.602
Oh.

37:49.686 --> 37:50.979
I see.

37:52.897 --> 37:54.315
Well, then.

37:56.484 --> 37:58.403
Thank you, Hunter.

38:00.113 --> 38:02.907
I hope someone treats you
with the same grace

38:02.991 --> 38:05.493
when your time comes.

38:05.577 --> 38:07.162
And it's coming.

38:13.793 --> 38:15.628
Oh, my God,
I almost feel bad.

38:15.712 --> 38:17.630
Don't.
She wiped the floor with him.

38:17.714 --> 38:18.715
He was a mop.

38:18.798 --> 38:22.677
He was a wet, wet mop.

38:24.012 --> 38:26.264
You know, her sexual politics
are an A-plus,

38:26.348 --> 38:27.891
but her food politics--

38:27.974 --> 38:29.017
I don't know
if you read the book.

38:29.100 --> 38:30.352
They're just the worst.

38:30.435 --> 38:32.103
If she saw two women
eating dessert

38:32.187 --> 38:33.730
with nary a man present,

38:33.813 --> 38:35.190
we'd be thrown into girl jail.

38:35.273 --> 38:37.067
And it's all
a little grandiose.

38:37.150 --> 38:39.486
And true, she talks
about sexual freedom,

38:39.569 --> 38:40.820
and quite frankly at that,

38:40.904 --> 38:43.573
but without any real
nuts-and-bolts information

38:43.656 --> 38:45.075
about how
to take care of yourself

38:45.158 --> 38:46.868
within that freedom.

38:46.951 --> 38:49.037
You mean orgasms?

38:49.120 --> 38:50.163
I mean pregnancy.

38:52.832 --> 38:56.336
Okay.
I had a night.

38:56.419 --> 38:57.671
A--a great night.

38:57.754 --> 38:59.631
A really great night.

38:59.714 --> 39:00.924
Sounds like a great night.

39:01.007 --> 39:02.842
It was, but now I am afraid

39:02.926 --> 39:05.470
that it's going to cost me
the rest of my life.

39:05.553 --> 39:07.722
I'm nauseous, I have
this weird pain in my side,

39:07.806 --> 39:09.474
and I have to pee all the time.

39:09.557 --> 39:11.101
When did you have your night?

39:11.184 --> 39:12.560
It was four days ago.

39:12.644 --> 39:14.270
No, you're not pregnant.

39:14.354 --> 39:15.647
And the odds
of getting pregnant

39:15.730 --> 39:18.149
from having sex one time
are super low.

39:18.233 --> 39:21.361
It was three times.

39:21.444 --> 39:22.404
You're still not pregnant,

39:22.487 --> 39:23.863
and if you were,
you wouldn't know,

39:23.947 --> 39:25.115
not yet.

39:26.950 --> 39:29.786
Can I ask you
an intimate question?

39:29.869 --> 39:30.995
I mean, you can ask.

39:31.079 --> 39:34.416
After all those times,
did you pee?

39:34.499 --> 39:35.667
No.

39:35.750 --> 39:37.961
But we spooned.

39:38.044 --> 39:39.212
You should have peed.

39:39.295 --> 39:41.256
It's, uh, sort of a rule,
my dear.

39:41.339 --> 39:42.424
A rule?

39:42.507 --> 39:45.176
To prevent you
from getting a UTI.

39:45.260 --> 39:46.636
You have a UTI.

39:46.720 --> 39:47.846
Oh, uh--

39:47.929 --> 39:50.056
A urinary tract infection.

39:50.140 --> 39:51.224
Oh.

39:52.809 --> 39:54.394
Oh, how wonderful!

39:54.477 --> 39:55.687
Oh.

39:55.770 --> 39:57.731
Oh, thank you.

39:57.814 --> 40:00.775
So we need to get you
on some antibiotics,

40:00.859 --> 40:04.320
and then, if you want
to have sex a fourth time...

40:04.404 --> 40:05.613
Yes, I do.

40:05.697 --> 40:07.073
You need to get
on contraception.

40:07.157 --> 40:09.034
And I will help you.

40:09.117 --> 40:12.245
Well, you are amazing.

40:12.328 --> 40:14.289
You should write a book.

40:14.372 --> 40:15.582
Maybe I should.

40:15.665 --> 40:17.334
My parents would plotz.

40:17.417 --> 40:18.918
Or better yet, make a show.

40:19.002 --> 40:20.920
Women talking to women
about things

40:21.004 --> 40:22.422
no one else talks about
on television.

40:22.505 --> 40:24.632
Is this what you
wanted to spitball about?

40:24.716 --> 40:26.885
Mm-hmm.

40:26.968 --> 40:27.886
Cool.

40:27.969 --> 40:30.263
To Julia.

40:30.347 --> 40:32.349
For bringing us together.

40:32.432 --> 40:34.017
To Julia.

40:36.811 --> 40:39.189
I didn't know
my aunt and uncle well.

40:39.272 --> 40:42.150
Well, they were
wonderful people.

40:42.233 --> 40:43.485
And so charming.

40:43.568 --> 40:47.197
And they had us over one night
for Friday night dinner.

40:47.280 --> 40:48.990
And I discovered challah bread,

40:49.074 --> 40:50.617
and nothing's been
the same since.

40:51.951 --> 40:54.079
Are they no longer in Paris?

40:54.162 --> 40:55.330
They tried.

40:55.413 --> 40:57.165
That's probably
when you knew them.

40:57.248 --> 40:58.750
But it was very hard

40:58.833 --> 41:00.794
for many Jewish people
after the war.

41:00.877 --> 41:04.673
Guilt made the anti-Semitism
worse, not better.

41:04.756 --> 41:08.510
After all, Paris stands
because she gave up her Jews.

41:08.593 --> 41:12.931
We were made to feel
like thieves in our own homes.

41:13.014 --> 41:15.433
Neighbors would stare.

41:15.517 --> 41:17.894
Worse than stare.

41:17.977 --> 41:19.521
It was too much
for my aunt and uncle.

41:19.604 --> 41:22.732
They sold the flat
and moved to Israel.

41:24.234 --> 41:25.777
- Oh.
- Gosh.

41:25.860 --> 41:27.112
Yes.

41:30.657 --> 41:32.200
I'm sorry
for taking up your time

41:32.283 --> 41:33.326
and dredging all this up.

41:33.410 --> 41:34.828
No, no, no.

41:34.911 --> 41:36.871
It's nice to remember.

41:36.955 --> 41:40.458
Well, not nice, but important.

41:42.210 --> 41:43.837
My parents converted.

41:43.920 --> 41:45.130
They didn't want to leave,

41:45.213 --> 41:47.590
and that felt
like the safest way to stay.

41:47.674 --> 41:49.050
France is their home.

41:49.134 --> 41:52.053
My aunt and uncle
didn't understand.

41:52.137 --> 41:55.140
But for us, it was
the right thing.

41:55.223 --> 41:57.225
Yes, you poor soul.

42:00.812 --> 42:05.108
Your aunt and uncle had
a magnificent art collection.

42:05.191 --> 42:08.570
It was part of my job
to--to help locate it.

42:10.864 --> 42:11.823
I'm sorry.

42:15.118 --> 42:17.328
Please don't apologize.
There's...

42:17.412 --> 42:20.457
there's nothing,
uh, for you to apologize for.

42:20.540 --> 42:22.459
I just wish I had
a better answer.

42:23.877 --> 42:26.463
Yes.
I do, too.

42:33.762 --> 42:34.846
It's stunning.

42:39.267 --> 42:41.269
"Donor unknown."

42:43.146 --> 42:44.439
They've been erased.

42:53.114 --> 42:55.575
You tried, Paulski.

42:55.658 --> 42:57.369
What does it matter?

42:58.953 --> 43:01.706
It matters to me.

43:01.790 --> 43:04.250
And I'm sure
it mattered to them.

43:04.334 --> 43:06.252
They lost everything.

43:06.336 --> 43:08.046
What I lost...

43:12.133 --> 43:16.137
We just have no idea, do we?

43:16.221 --> 43:20.266
What any of it means.

43:20.350 --> 43:22.102
What we do.

43:37.534 --> 43:40.704
I sometimes wonder,

43:40.787 --> 43:43.123
if we had had children...

43:45.083 --> 43:47.460
They would have been
who they are...

43:49.713 --> 43:52.549
Not the sum
of everything we gave them.

43:56.302 --> 43:58.847
You were the one
who reminded me,

43:58.930 --> 44:02.726
we don't control
what the things we do mean,

44:02.809 --> 44:04.394
only what we want them to mean.

44:06.062 --> 44:08.356
I did, didn't I?

44:08.440 --> 44:11.067
The show is our baby.

44:11.151 --> 44:15.280
It's growing up,
and it needs us.

44:15.363 --> 44:18.825
We still have chapters
left to write, Paulski.

44:18.908 --> 44:22.328
We don't need
to look back anymore.

44:22.412 --> 44:24.539
The climax of the story

44:24.622 --> 44:29.711
always occurs
in the second act.

44:31.296 --> 44:33.340
That's the best part.
