WEBVTT

00:04.086 --> 00:05.339
Okay, check this out.

00:05.422 --> 00:07.633
I just added this really fun new feature

00:07.716 --> 00:09.801
where before you can access
any of the controls,

00:09.885 --> 00:12.763
you have to solve, like,
a crazy difficult word puzzle.

00:13.931 --> 00:16.308
So you can't play until you do homework?

00:17.100 --> 00:18.560
Well, no-- It's--

00:18.644 --> 00:21.021
It's not homework,
It's ki-- It's like work,

00:21.104 --> 00:23.899
that you would do at home. But it's fun.

00:23.982 --> 00:26.527
Yeah, that is super fun.
Everybody loves homework.

00:26.610 --> 00:30.489
Hey, this MQ movie thing is, like,
really bothering me.

00:30.572 --> 00:32.908
How could I not even be consulted on it?

00:32.991 --> 00:34.535
Because you don't work there anymore.

00:34.618 --> 00:37.788
Well, yeah, but my DNA
is literally all over that game.

00:38.497 --> 00:40.832
I'm not sure if you mean
the word "literally" literally,

00:40.916 --> 00:43.836
but given all the weird shit you're into
at the moment, I don't wanna know.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.171
Yeah, that is kinda gross, isn't it?

00:46.672 --> 00:48.173
Thank you for bringing that
to my attention.

00:48.257 --> 00:50.050
That's not what I meant.
I meant "metaphorically."

00:50.133 --> 00:52.010
Uh-huh, cool.
Let's just pretend that you didn't say it.

00:52.094 --> 00:53.554
I recognize that MQ is in the past,

00:53.637 --> 00:55.514
but what if the story
isn't told correctly?

00:55.597 --> 00:56.807
It'll chip away at my legacy.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.017
-Ian.
-Our legacy.

00:59.101 --> 01:00.352
-Sorry.
-No. No, no.

01:00.435 --> 01:03.105
Movies. People love movies.

01:03.188 --> 01:06.817
Because they're fun, and they're sexy,
and people love sex, and--

01:07.401 --> 01:08.569
Okay, what if--

01:10.445 --> 01:15.200
What if, in order to access the controls,
you have to undress a character?

01:15.701 --> 01:19.371
Why do all of your ideas involve
limiting access to controls?

01:19.454 --> 01:21.290
I don't think you know what fun is.

01:21.373 --> 01:24.376
I don't know. I think I'm really going off
the rails here.

01:26.086 --> 01:29.256
You know what?
I need to go back to basics and,

01:29.339 --> 01:31.592
you know, trust my instincts, and if I--

01:34.136 --> 01:35.095
That's weird.

01:35.179 --> 01:37.097
-What?
-I'm going through the engine code,

01:37.181 --> 01:39.558
and someone just took assets
off the server

01:39.641 --> 01:41.685
and moved them to an off-site address.

01:42.269 --> 01:43.604
Shit. It just happened again.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.148
-Someone's stealing from us?
-Yeah, yeah.

01:47.149 --> 01:49.484
Let me check the digital fingerprint,

01:49.568 --> 01:50.652
and maybe I can…

01:50.736 --> 01:52.613
-Is it Brendan?
-Who, Pootie Shoe?

01:52.696 --> 01:54.907
-Yeah.
-I don't know. It's--

01:55.991 --> 01:56.992
Oh, my God.

01:59.536 --> 02:00.537
It's Dana.

02:19.765 --> 02:23.435
So, let me get this straight.

02:25.896 --> 02:30.734
The three of you
put a new monetization tool into the game

02:30.817 --> 02:34.238
without telling me,
the executive producer, first.

02:34.821 --> 02:35.822
-Judases.
-Jo.

02:35.906 --> 02:38.784
-David, I can explain. I--
-No. It's too late to explain.

02:38.867 --> 02:41.119
You see, 'cause Montreal called me up
this morning,

02:41.203 --> 02:43.497
and they had questions
about our new NFT project.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.040
And I had no idea
what they were talking about.

02:45.123 --> 02:46.625
-He had to vamp.
-Yes, I did.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.294
-He sucks at vamping.
-Yes I-- Well, no, I'm great at vamping.

02:49.378 --> 02:51.630
-Really? You seemed flustered. M--
-I wasn't flustered. I--

02:51.713 --> 02:53.590
-You were stuttering.
-I was stuttering be--

02:53.674 --> 02:55.509
They have a thing where-- Sometimes--

02:56.009 --> 02:58.136
-You're supposed to ask.
-Sorry, David.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.013
They're sorry, Jo.

03:00.097 --> 03:01.431
-They're sorry.
-Yeah.

03:01.932 --> 03:03.934
Well, guess what? Sorry don't cut it.

03:04.017 --> 03:08.772
Because Montreal wants a name
of who came up with this project,

03:09.273 --> 03:10.315
and frankly, I do too.

03:10.816 --> 03:16.780
Now, one of you was the mastermind
to this nefarious little plot.

03:18.532 --> 03:21.910
And I think I know exactly who…

03:24.413 --> 03:25.622
it was.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.291
It was me, David.

03:28.417 --> 03:29.793
-What?
-It's all my fault.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.337
-No.
-Okay, I was sick of being a figurehead

03:32.421 --> 03:34.339
-and just thought that if I could--
-No. No.

03:34.423 --> 03:35.340
-Yes.
-No!

03:35.424 --> 03:36.800
-Yes.
-No, Carol. No. It is him.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.804
This is all part of
Brad's devious, little plan.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.472
He has a plan, you know. He told me.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.309
You told me I wouldn't know anything
about it, Brad.

03:45.392 --> 03:48.353
You said I wouldn't feel it.
But I do feel it.

03:49.146 --> 03:52.024
I feel it everywhere. It's all up in me.
It's on me. It's through me.

03:52.107 --> 03:54.568
-It's so painful.
-David, look. This isn't their fault.

03:54.651 --> 03:58.947
It's not Brad or Carol's fault. Okay?
It is my fault. It was my idea.

03:59.031 --> 04:01.241
I'm confused.
Is she taking the blame or the credit?

04:01.325 --> 04:02.618
Both, interesting.

04:02.701 --> 04:05.913
Neither.
I was just trying to give David an out.

04:05.996 --> 04:07.915
What is the out?
What, I call Jacques and Jean-Luc,

04:07.998 --> 04:10.125
and I'm like, "Hey, yeah, this--

04:10.209 --> 04:12.961
this vagabond ex-employee
takes full responsibility.

04:13.045 --> 04:14.630
Yes, it's all cool, bros."

04:14.713 --> 04:18.509
"Yeah, this, you know,
rando, unemployable woman

04:18.591 --> 04:20.260
who just walked right into our office,

04:20.344 --> 04:23.180
she's making major financial decisions."

04:23.263 --> 04:25.432
"Yes, don't sweat it, bros. It's all cool.
It's all good, bro.

04:25.516 --> 04:26.850
We're all a bunch of cool dudes, bro."

04:26.934 --> 04:29.186
-I wouldn't put it that way.
-Yeah, you shouldn't vamp.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.064
-I'm gonna write something up for you.
-I can vamp. I just-- They--

04:32.147 --> 04:33.148
Because they-- And--

04:35.067 --> 04:36.985
I just got an e-mail from Montreal.

04:37.819 --> 04:40.531
They would like
to speak with me later this afternoon.

04:42.533 --> 04:44.785
-Dead Carol walking.
-How do they already know about--

04:44.868 --> 04:46.954
I sent them a message
the second she said, "It was me."

04:47.037 --> 04:49.623
Jo, you're supposed to ask.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.291
Great meeting.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.252
It's over? Okay.

05:08.934 --> 05:10.102
What the--

05:10.185 --> 05:12.896
You're busted, you shitbag!

05:13.772 --> 05:16.066
Way too hot, Pop. Way too hot.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.444
Fine then, just you're busted,
but you're busted good.

05:19.528 --> 05:21.697
Okay,
before this whole thing gets rolling,

05:21.780 --> 05:24.575
I just wanna go on record as saying
I was against the theatrics.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.451
-What is going on?
-You're a thief.

05:26.535 --> 05:28.829
And now that I'm warmed up,
you're also a shitbag.

05:28.912 --> 05:31.206
And before you try to
turn this around on me,

05:31.290 --> 05:33.166
that's a licensed Getty image
of Wayne Knight.

05:33.250 --> 05:35.252
So there's no IP theft on my end.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.712
What about the sound clip?

05:36.795 --> 05:39.089
Sounds like
it was ripped straight from Jurassic Park.

05:39.173 --> 05:40.174
Shit.

05:40.257 --> 05:42.593
Okay, you're confused,
which is totally understandable

05:42.676 --> 05:44.344
based on the theatrics that you just saw.

05:45.095 --> 05:46.513
So, I'm gonna take over this whole thing.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.349
We noticed that there was some evidence

05:49.433 --> 05:51.685
to suggest you were
stripping some code out,

05:51.768 --> 05:54.354
and then Poppy started shaking violently.

05:54.438 --> 05:56.982
-Well, that's how I process adrenaline.
-Sure.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.985
Either way,
we realized we had to confront you.

06:00.068 --> 06:03.655
And unfortunately there were some
ridiculous antics that got us here,

06:03.739 --> 06:04.823
but here we are.

06:04.907 --> 06:06.241
You stole Hera.

06:06.325 --> 06:07.826
Why would I steal Hera?

06:07.910 --> 06:09.411
Because it's fun.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.918
That look was devastating.

06:17.336 --> 06:19.254
It's-- Why is she still…

06:20.172 --> 06:21.173
Respect me.

06:21.256 --> 06:24.259
Poppy, I just downloaded
the Playpen tool kit you made for me.

06:24.343 --> 06:27.679
The tool set
that I shat out to keep you busy?

06:27.763 --> 06:29.848
Yeah, you kept saying you shat it out,

06:29.932 --> 06:32.684
so I didn't think it was a big deal
if I shared it with my friends.

06:32.768 --> 06:34.895
It's actually pretty fun
to mess around with.

06:34.978 --> 06:37.022
You shared that piece of shit--

06:37.105 --> 06:42.069
That valuable,
proprietary program with your friends?

06:42.152 --> 06:43.445
Why? It's shit.

06:43.987 --> 06:46.573
I'm sorry, do you think it's shit?
I can't tell.

06:46.657 --> 06:48.534
I gotta be honest,
I appreciate the initiative.

06:48.617 --> 06:51.620
It's like you disrupted
not having something to do.

06:51.703 --> 06:53.914
It's better to ask for forgiveness
than permission.

06:53.997 --> 06:55.499
I'm not asking for forgiveness.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.584
Yes. Yes, I like that.

06:57.668 --> 06:58.836
I didn't do anything wrong.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.463
Absolutely. And the more you say it,
the more you believe it.

07:01.547 --> 07:02.881
I do believe it.

07:02.965 --> 07:04.675
She is learning. She is g--

07:04.758 --> 07:06.635
-Hold on a second, sorry.
-Learning what? I don't--

07:06.718 --> 07:10.264
I get an alert every time there's
a new move on the MQ movie.

07:11.890 --> 07:15.352
Wait a second, they've attached a star.
Joe Manganiello?

07:16.895 --> 07:19.314
What? This guy?

07:20.065 --> 07:21.775
No. This guy.

07:24.361 --> 07:27.197
No. I won't have it. No.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.491
I'm so sorry, Dana.

07:29.575 --> 07:30.576
Thanks, Ian.

07:33.996 --> 07:37.332
Thank you. I understand. Goodbye.

07:41.044 --> 07:42.629
That was the call, huh?

07:46.800 --> 07:49.219
I'm sorry, Carol.
I didn't mean to get you fired.

07:50.596 --> 07:53.599
Okay, look, I mean,
I'm sure this is pretty traumatic,

07:53.682 --> 07:56.935
-but there's always a chance to rebound--
-They promoted me. Again.

07:57.519 --> 07:59.563
-Wait, what?
-They love the NFTs.

08:00.272 --> 08:03.483
They actually praised me
for taking the ideas of a janitor

08:03.567 --> 08:05.694
and a college dropout and called it

08:05.777 --> 08:08.989
"sourcing ideas from under-utilized
talent pools" or some shit.

08:09.615 --> 08:11.700
They bumped me up to a new position

08:11.783 --> 08:14.745
with stock options and an actual budget.

08:15.287 --> 08:19.291
Short story, my gold handcuffs
just went platinum.

08:19.374 --> 08:20.834
Okay, wait, what's the new position?

08:20.918 --> 08:23.545
Director
of Unexplored Development Initiatives.

08:24.379 --> 08:25.380
The DUDI.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.092
And coupled
with your previous responsibilities,

08:29.176 --> 08:30.177
that makes you…

08:30.260 --> 08:31.803
The HODI-DUDI?

08:31.887 --> 08:33.096
The HODI-DUDI.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.640
The HODI-DUDI.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.015
The HODI-DUDI!

08:37.308 --> 08:38.393
Failing up.

08:39.394 --> 08:43.023
It feels so right.
Or, should I say, white?

08:46.026 --> 08:49.488
And this new DUDI can hire
whoever she damn well pleases

08:49.571 --> 08:51.615
because she's got an actual budget.

08:52.366 --> 08:53.367
Interesting.

09:03.585 --> 09:06.171
I don't have time
for whatever amateur home brews

09:06.255 --> 09:07.548
you and your mates have built.

09:07.631 --> 09:11.218
I'm trying to run an eight-figure company.
Goddamn it, Dana!

09:11.802 --> 09:12.928
-Is that…
-What?

09:14.096 --> 09:16.515
Is this a Jolly Rancher in your hair?

09:16.598 --> 09:18.058
It's a barrette.

09:22.938 --> 09:24.064
Okay.

09:25.190 --> 09:26.984
I made this in Playpen.

09:29.278 --> 09:32.239
Okay, well, I mean, the graphics are shit.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.908
These are the max specs
you programmed into Playpen.

09:34.992 --> 09:37.494
How do you keep forgetting
that you made this game?

09:37.578 --> 09:39.329
Well, they're shit in an elegant way.

09:39.413 --> 09:42.165
You know, impressive
for such a bare-bones program.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.417
Throw out your hands.

09:46.336 --> 09:47.504
What is this?

09:47.588 --> 09:49.590
-It's a fishing game.
-Right. That's what I thought.

09:49.673 --> 09:51.967
-What did you think?
-No, I didn't think it was anything weird.

09:52.050 --> 09:54.511
I thought maybe it was a spoont simulator.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.430
-Spoont?
-Yeah. You know, like…

09:59.600 --> 10:02.019
-I don't know what that is.
-You know, like spoont. Like sprog.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.146
-Just say what it is.
-I am saying what it is.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.316
-What do I--
-Reel it in!

10:08.066 --> 10:09.735
All of this was made in Playpen?

10:10.319 --> 10:12.779
It was. Everyone can make games with this.

10:12.863 --> 10:17.868
-Hey. Come here, you little bitch.
-There you go.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.912
Here, I wanna show you
another game we made.

10:19.995 --> 10:21.830
-Okay.
-Over here.

10:22.456 --> 10:26.585
So, this one is amazing.
You have to wrap the candies really fast,

10:26.668 --> 10:29.046
-but if you miss more than six, you lose.
-Okay.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.632
And there's a cheat
that I found where you can eat them.

10:31.715 --> 10:32.841
It's weirdly satisfying.

10:33.509 --> 10:35.469
We're like Lucy and Ethel.

10:35.552 --> 10:37.846
I can't keep up
with all your gay, throuple friends.

10:37.930 --> 10:40.140
-I mean I Love Lucy.
-I'm not hip.

10:40.224 --> 10:42.434
-I don't know queer culture.
-What?

10:42.518 --> 10:44.770
It's like an insanely old,
classic TV show.

10:44.853 --> 10:46.772
Are you actually eating something?

10:46.855 --> 10:48.524
Where did you get chocolates from?

10:48.607 --> 10:50.567
I have pockets, Dana.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.198
So?

10:57.407 --> 10:58.408
So what?

10:59.034 --> 11:01.161
-It's fun.
-It's really basic.

11:01.245 --> 11:02.496
-But fun.
-Rudimentary.

11:02.579 --> 11:04.540
-But fun?
-Maybe for children,

11:04.623 --> 11:06.625
or adults with baby brains.

11:06.708 --> 11:08.794
-But it's…
-Yes! It's fun.

11:08.877 --> 11:10.170
Okay? You happy?

11:10.254 --> 11:14.508
It's fun. But anyone can make
something that's fun.

11:16.385 --> 11:18.387
-You wanna play again?
-Yeah, I wanna play again.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.598
Okay, how about these, huh?

11:21.682 --> 11:23.767
How do I look?
Big-time Hollywood producer?

11:23.851 --> 11:26.144
More like big-time Hollywood pedophile.

11:26.228 --> 11:29.356
Okay, well, they're prescription.
Can't return them.

11:29.439 --> 11:30.649
-David?
-Shooter!

11:30.732 --> 11:31.733
David, get down!

11:32.609 --> 11:35.112
-What?
-David, I have Ian for you.

11:36.280 --> 11:37.447
Thank you, Jo.

11:37.531 --> 11:38.407
I don't know.

11:39.199 --> 11:42.077
I came up to talk about the movie?

11:42.160 --> 11:45.080
Oh, yeah.
You saw the mention in the trades?

11:45.163 --> 11:46.874
Yeah, we're pretty happy with the buzz.

11:46.957 --> 11:48.250
-Right, Jo?
-Pretty happy.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.919
All right. Why was I not
at least not consulted?

11:51.003 --> 11:51.962
Why would you be?

11:52.045 --> 11:55.340
Because I'm the visionary
who came up with the entire story?

11:55.424 --> 11:56.800
You were. Then you left.

11:58.177 --> 12:01.388
Okay, but I've been talking
about doing an MQ movie for years.

12:01.471 --> 12:02.639
But I made it happen.

12:02.723 --> 12:05.851
All right, fine. But Joe Manganiello?
I mean, come on.

12:05.934 --> 12:08.353
No one's gonna believe that
he could play me. He's not big enough.

12:08.437 --> 12:09.271
He's like 6'4".

12:09.354 --> 12:11.023
-6'5".
-6'5". 6'5".

12:11.106 --> 12:13.692
I meant my metaphysical size.

12:13.775 --> 12:15.861
He doesn't have the presence
to carry my stature.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.196
-I get that.
-Thank you, Jo.

12:17.279 --> 12:19.198
Whose side are you on? Look, I'm sorry.

12:19.698 --> 12:21.491
Who do you think this movie is about? You?

12:21.575 --> 12:24.494
-Well, who else would it be about?
-The game, obviously.

12:24.578 --> 12:25.621
Well, I created the game.

12:25.704 --> 12:28.415
So? Is Superman about the man
who created Superman? No.

12:28.498 --> 12:30.584
The guy's just some nerd
who came up with a comic book.

12:30.667 --> 12:31.793
Nerd.

12:31.877 --> 12:35.047
No, the guy that created Superman
would be Superman's dad.

12:35.130 --> 12:37.633
Who, I guess, would technically be
more powerful than Superman.

12:37.716 --> 12:39.635
Jo, put it in the notes
that David called me Superman.

12:39.718 --> 12:41.637
No, do not put in the notes
that this man is Superman.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.347
You're not Superman, okay?

12:43.430 --> 12:47.726
You are a 5'7" mortal man
with no superpowers,

12:47.809 --> 12:51.438
no ability to fly,
and no ability to stop the movie.

12:51.522 --> 12:53.524
We are making a movie without you.

12:53.607 --> 12:56.777
Jo, can you put in the notes
that I am 5'10"?

12:56.860 --> 12:59.530
It's very clearly stated
all over the Internet.

12:59.613 --> 13:02.115
Jo, put in the notes
that this man wears lifts in his shoes.

13:02.199 --> 13:03.492
Jo, could you put in the notes

13:03.575 --> 13:08.455
that this man is taking off his shoes
and presenting them to David,

13:08.539 --> 13:12.251
and to anybody who would like to see,
that there is not a lift in those shoes.

13:12.334 --> 13:15.003
And would you like to know the size?
Thirteen.

13:15.087 --> 13:17.047
-Let me see that.
-No, sorry. It's back on my foot.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.340
-It's too late.
-That is so sad.

13:18.423 --> 13:21.510
Put in the notes that David said
he wanted to see my feet. Creepy.

13:21.593 --> 13:22.970
Get out of my office, okay?

13:23.512 --> 13:24.513
Whatever.

13:24.596 --> 13:25.472
Little bitch.

13:25.556 --> 13:26.849
Ian, come back.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.852
-What's that?
-Mr. Brittlesbee wasn't done with you.

13:29.935 --> 13:31.603
I don't think you heard
the last thing he said.

13:31.687 --> 13:33.313
-What was it?
-No, I--

13:33.397 --> 13:36.066
-No, he heard everything.
-I don't think he heard the last thing.

13:36.692 --> 13:37.901
What was the last part?

13:37.985 --> 13:40.696
I just-- I said, you know, just--

13:41.864 --> 13:43.198
Yeah, thanks, bro.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.534
No, you said…

13:46.660 --> 13:47.619
-Cool.
-Cool.

13:48.996 --> 13:51.707
So, I can consult on the movie?

13:53.375 --> 13:56.670
I mean, yeah. Yeah. I mean--

13:56.753 --> 13:58.630
Of course. It's cool.

13:59.256 --> 14:00.632
-All right, awesome. Thanks.
-Cool.

14:00.716 --> 14:01.967
Just-- And also with, like,

14:02.050 --> 14:04.136
all casting decisions, like,
you gotta run those by me.

14:04.219 --> 14:05.387
Yeah.

14:05.470 --> 14:07.222
Thank you. That's all I'm--
That's all I need.

14:07.306 --> 14:09.474
I mean, like, casting decisions,
things like that. I feel like…

14:11.518 --> 14:12.769
What about Pitt, Brad Pitt?

14:12.853 --> 14:14.938
Hire a 5'8" actor,
you get a 5'8" performance.

14:15.022 --> 14:17.065
Manganiello's real touchy on Brad Pitt.
So, let's not.

14:17.149 --> 14:20.235
I'm putting it out there,
and we'll let the universe sort it out.

14:20.319 --> 14:21.320
Yeah.

14:21.403 --> 14:24.489
Okay, all right. Okay, thank you.
Thanks, David. Thanks, Jo.

14:24.573 --> 14:25.824
-See you, bro.
-Thank you.

14:40.172 --> 14:44.426
Oh, my God, Brad. Jesus.
Is everything okay?

14:44.510 --> 14:46.136
Yeah, everything's great.
Why wouldn't it be?

14:46.220 --> 14:49.097
Because you texted me,

14:49.181 --> 14:52.601
"911, Rachel. Come fast.
911. It's an emergency. 911."

14:52.684 --> 14:53.769
Yeah, never mind that.

14:54.603 --> 14:55.562
-What?
-Rachel,

14:55.646 --> 14:58.649
you think you could be a good person
and make enormous amounts of money?

14:58.732 --> 15:02.528
I don't know, Brad.
Why are you asking me this?

15:03.278 --> 15:05.239
Because Carol needs a new HOMIE,

15:05.322 --> 15:09.117
but I'm not sure
I'm the right person for it anymore.

15:09.201 --> 15:10.202
I'm too…

15:12.704 --> 15:13.705
good.

15:17.584 --> 15:20.212
You're serious. No.

15:20.295 --> 15:25.300
Don't say that. You're still evil.

15:25.384 --> 15:27.302
Name one evil thing I've done
in the last two months.

15:29.513 --> 15:35.102
I mean,
you're more sketchy than evil recently.

15:35.185 --> 15:38.438
But that's, like,
kind of in the same vibe.

15:39.773 --> 15:41.316
Okay, look, Brad.
It's good. It's a good thing.

15:41.400 --> 15:44.069
It's-It-- You're turning a new leaf.

15:44.152 --> 15:45.445
You know, that's great, Brad.

15:45.529 --> 15:49.992
And you can absolutely be a good person
and be Head of Monetization.

15:50.576 --> 15:53.120
Games have to be profitable.
Players get that.

15:53.787 --> 15:56.915
It's just about finding creative ways

15:56.999 --> 15:58.917
to add value for the money
they're spending.

15:59.668 --> 16:03.297
And, you know, letting them know
that you really respect them and the game.

16:03.380 --> 16:05.215
You're not just trying
to take their money.

16:05.841 --> 16:07.968
I don't know,
I think it could be so great for MQ

16:08.051 --> 16:11.305
to have a Head of Monetization
that really cares about stuff like that.

16:11.388 --> 16:12.931
Great, so you'll take the job?

16:14.600 --> 16:16.894
-What? Me?
-Yes, you.

16:16.977 --> 16:21.023
No. I'm gonna be a writer, Brad.

16:21.106 --> 16:24.818
Yuck.
You have a natural gift for monetization.

16:24.902 --> 16:26.486
You're afraid it'll make you a bad person.

16:26.570 --> 16:27.905
It goes against all of your ideals.

16:27.988 --> 16:31.867
That's why I knew the only person
that could talk you into it is yourself.

16:32.951 --> 16:34.453
You are evil.

16:34.536 --> 16:36.163
I'm also unable to assume
my former position

16:36.246 --> 16:37.623
because of SEC issues.

16:37.706 --> 16:42.461
But you can do it, and I can help you.
And together we'll be unstoppable.

16:45.255 --> 16:46.256
Just think about it.

16:58.018 --> 16:59.144
I hit a button.

16:59.228 --> 17:02.689
Wha-- Which one did I hit?
Is it-- I think I--

17:02.773 --> 17:04.608
Now none of them are working.
Why are none of them working?

17:04.691 --> 17:06.944
-Okay, we'll get there.
-Did I-- Wait, hold on, I can do it.

17:07.027 --> 17:11.906
Yo, Poppy. I was thinking about
the spoont-- the fishing game,

17:11.990 --> 17:14.660
and I bet if we go to a different part
of the island, we can catch something.

17:14.742 --> 17:15.953
Leave me alone.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.247
What's going on? You okay?

17:18.329 --> 17:20.582
No, I'm not okay.

17:21.124 --> 17:25.462
Do you have the taffy shits again?
I am not loaning you my sweats this time.

17:26.547 --> 17:27.798
I'm a failure.

17:27.881 --> 17:29.967
A failure? You?

17:30.050 --> 17:33.720
I spent a year of my life building Hera.

17:33.804 --> 17:36.098
It was my dream.
It was meant to be the thing.

17:36.181 --> 17:40.769
It was meant to be the thing
that launched me into the stratosphere,

17:40.853 --> 17:43.730
like what Mythic Quest did for Ian.
And it's garbage.

17:43.814 --> 17:46.066
But think about how great Playpen is.

17:46.149 --> 17:48.986
-And you built that in, like, half a day.
-Right, exactly.

17:49.069 --> 17:51.905
I built a bunch of tools

17:51.989 --> 17:55.158
that now other people are using
to make fun games.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.995
And I didn't even know that it was fun.
You had to tell me.

17:58.954 --> 18:00.581
That's the problem. I just--

18:03.709 --> 18:05.169
I don't see it.

18:07.004 --> 18:09.464
I don't see it like Ian does.

18:12.050 --> 18:13.927
I build systems.

18:16.013 --> 18:17.681
I'm a glorified mechanic.

18:24.688 --> 18:25.856
And…

18:29.651 --> 18:30.861
you know, people…

18:33.238 --> 18:34.948
people don't celebrate mechanics.

18:37.201 --> 18:39.703
Just once,
I wanted to feel what Ian feels.

18:47.503 --> 18:48.504
Come with me.

18:56.887 --> 18:59.556
Where are we going?
I don't know if I like this.

18:59.640 --> 19:02.392
I don't want to play any more games
more fun than mine.

19:02.476 --> 19:04.686
I just want
to show you something real quick.

19:05.729 --> 19:06.730
What is it?

19:06.813 --> 19:09.816
Is this some kind of
brawly, fistfight-y game?

19:09.900 --> 19:11.527
'Cause I will leave none of you alive!

19:11.610 --> 19:13.654
No! Sorry, she's really passionate.

19:13.737 --> 19:17.824
These are my classmates,
and they came to see you.

19:17.908 --> 19:20.077
They've been building games in Playpen.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.996
Everybody, this is Poppy Li.

19:29.878 --> 19:31.880
-This is for me?
-Yeah.

19:50.023 --> 19:51.191
Oh, my God.

19:51.775 --> 19:56.363
Ian! Ian, I got it.
I saw it. I figured it out.

19:56.446 --> 19:57.447
Ian!

19:58.490 --> 19:59.491
Ian!

20:00.284 --> 20:02.202
-Hey, Pop.
-Why aren't you answering your phone?

20:02.286 --> 20:04.621
I'm kind of busy with something.
What's up?

20:04.705 --> 20:06.039
Playpen.

20:06.915 --> 20:08.876
Hear me out.
I know that it looks like shit,

20:08.959 --> 20:12.004
and it's so simple
a child could have coded it. But it's fun!

20:12.087 --> 20:15.591
I could work on Hera for a billion years,
and it will never be that.

20:15.674 --> 20:18.093
But somehow, I don't know how,
I don't know why--

20:18.177 --> 20:22.431
But it turns out
that my masterpiece is Playpen.

20:22.514 --> 20:25.350
You want to pivot from Hera
and just focus on Playpen?

20:25.434 --> 20:26.560
-Yeah.
-And you see it?

20:26.643 --> 20:27.644
I saw it.

20:27.728 --> 20:28.812
-You're sure?
-Yes.

20:28.896 --> 20:30.772
Great, awesome! Let's work on that!

20:30.856 --> 20:31.899
-Okay!
-All right.

20:33.192 --> 20:35.485
Hold on one sec. Not right this second.

20:35.569 --> 20:38.113
Ian, get back here and finish the job.

20:38.197 --> 20:40.073
I'm so-- Are you with someone right now?

20:40.157 --> 20:41.450
Yeah, Shannon came over.

20:41.533 --> 20:43.118
Shannon. Sha-- Sh--

20:44.077 --> 20:45.662
Shannon your ex.

20:45.746 --> 20:48.540
Oh, no.
Are you guys doing weird shit in here?

20:48.624 --> 20:50.584
-Yeah.
-I don't want to see this.

20:50.667 --> 20:51.877
Then why did you come over?

20:51.960 --> 20:54.129
Well, I didn't know
that you were having an orgy.

20:54.213 --> 20:58.008
Orgy? We didn't talk about this.

20:58.091 --> 21:01.011
I'm not saying I'm against it,
but we should discuss.

21:02.930 --> 21:05.891
-I'd be open to that conversation.
-Yeah. Not with her though.

21:05.974 --> 21:08.894
-Oh, Christ, no! Not with her.
-No, definitely not with me.

21:08.977 --> 21:13.482
Although to be clear, if I was involved,
it'd be the best you'd ever had.

21:13.565 --> 21:16.193
I am very good at sex.

21:17.194 --> 21:18.195
Uh-huh.

21:19.571 --> 21:22.824
Uh-huh.
Okay, well, this has been great.

21:22.908 --> 21:25.494
But clearly we're super busy, so I guess…

21:25.577 --> 21:29.081
Wait, no, no. No. I get the win today.

21:29.164 --> 21:30.666
I get to say, "See you tomorrow."

21:30.749 --> 21:32.751
Okay, cool. Shoot.

21:33.961 --> 21:35.629
See you tomorrow.

21:36.171 --> 21:37.422
Great. Bye.

21:37.506 --> 21:38.507
Bye.
