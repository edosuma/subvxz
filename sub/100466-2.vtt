01:00.038 --> 01:01.915
Hey!

01:05.418 --> 01:08.294
- How much do we owe?
- Come here, baby.

01:08.296 --> 01:12.592
- How much?
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:16.304 --> 01:20.306
- Eight million.
- Are they gonna take the house?

01:20.308 --> 01:23.226
Baby, they're gonna take everything.

01:23.228 --> 01:26.354
But the wedding with the Vironis
will clear our blood debt,

01:26.356 --> 01:28.898
and this job pays 10 million
straight up.

01:28.900 --> 01:35.196
- So we are home free, baby.
- You should have told me.

01:35.198 --> 01:38.243
I tell you now. I love my wife!

01:41.329 --> 01:43.248
Hey.

02:24.873 --> 02:27.208
Wait, wait.

02:29.044 --> 02:32.756
What, huh? What? What?

02:35.592 --> 02:41.596
This man attacked my son
in my own house.

02:41.598 --> 02:43.349
Didn't he?

02:46.478 --> 02:48.438
Didn't he, Loric?

02:50.023 --> 02:51.399
Yeah.

02:58.865 --> 03:00.617
Edon, don't!

03:02.911 --> 03:05.705
It's a fucking party! Enjoy!

<i>As you all know, it's been five years</i>

04:35.086 --> 04:37.587
<i>since ISIS proclaimed
a caliphate in Syria.</i>

04:37.589 --> 04:40.508
<i>Recently, however, jihadist
numbers have been falling.</i>

04:42.302 --> 04:44.010
<i>And then eight weeks ago,</i>

04:44.012 --> 04:47.388
<i>driven back by coalition bombardments
and ground forces,</i>

04:47.390 --> 04:52.602
<i>a cornered ISIS lieutenant,
Ismail Al-Bakur,</i>

04:52.604 --> 04:55.190
<i>tried to make the ultimate sacrifice.</i>

05:01.613 --> 05:04.489
<i>It didn't quite go as planned.</i>

05:04.491 --> 05:09.410
<i>During the subsequent interrogation,
there is the first mention of Zayef,</i>

05:09.412 --> 05:12.290
<i>the man our suspect Mahir
is supposedly working for.</i>

05:23.176 --> 05:26.135
<i>Then last month, a Bosniak arms runner</i>

05:26.137 --> 05:28.429
<i>was taken down in Paris,
near Gare du Nord.</i>

05:28.431 --> 05:31.182
<i>His phone contained
a propaganda video,</i>

05:31.184 --> 05:35.397
<i>a call to arms in the name of Zayef.</i>

05:55.166 --> 05:57.083
So what do we think?

05:57.085 --> 05:58.793
It's not exactly <i>Weekend at Bernie's,</i>
is it?

05:58.795 --> 06:01.879
Basically just a promo video to get us
all pumped up for this Zayef guy.

06:01.881 --> 06:03.548
So you're saying it's manufactured?

06:03.550 --> 06:06.759
No, just your standard propaganda.
It's all style, no substance.

06:06.761 --> 06:09.095
Kinda like people saying that Mac
would make a great officer

06:09.097 --> 06:10.722
when there's no actual evidence for it.

06:10.724 --> 06:13.808
- Or like Wyatt saying he's a crack shot.
- That's actually verifiable.

06:13.810 --> 06:17.729
- Uh, would Idrisi verify that?
- Ow.

06:17.731 --> 06:20.231
So, Chetters, you're saying that's all
we've got on this Zayef dude?

06:20.233 --> 06:22.817
- So far.
- What about the front man, Mahir?

06:22.819 --> 06:25.445
Mahir Hajdari, 32.

06:25.447 --> 06:28.239
Grew up in the Wahabbist strongholds
of Srebrenik, Bosnia.

06:28.241 --> 06:31.868
CIA tried to recruit him in 2013,

06:31.870 --> 06:34.495
when he was studying political science
at the University of Milan.

06:34.497 --> 06:38.458
Tried and failed. They felt
he wasn't worth their resources.

06:38.460 --> 06:40.460
Mahir is like a black hole
at the moment,

06:40.462 --> 06:42.962
but I'm seeing what other files
I can pull up.

06:42.964 --> 06:44.964
So we go after the people
selling the bioweapon.

06:44.966 --> 06:47.800
- And that means the Demachi family.
- We may have a weak link.

06:47.802 --> 06:50.053
My contacts in the Albanian police

06:50.055 --> 06:51.971
have said that there's some
serious friction

06:51.973 --> 06:55.016
between Edon, the father,
and his son, Loric.

06:55.018 --> 06:56.768
Define friction.

06:56.770 --> 06:59.520
Well, this man, Rudi Josa,
Loric's bodyguard.

06:59.522 --> 07:02.690
Rumors are that they were very close,
in every sense of the word.

07:02.692 --> 07:06.027
Apparently Edon had Rudi killed
this morning.

07:06.029 --> 07:10.573
All right, so we locate the son.
Let's see if he'll work with us.

07:10.575 --> 07:13.576
Loric manages a few of his father's
businesses downtown.

07:13.578 --> 07:15.411
There's the meat-packers,

07:15.413 --> 07:21.042
and then there's Cheetah's next door,
where he's scheduled to be today.

07:21.044 --> 07:22.585
Sorry, Cheetah's, what's that?

07:22.587 --> 07:27.634
- It's exactly what it sounds like, sir.
- Oh.

08:13.430 --> 08:14.848
- Yes?
- Hey.

08:22.605 --> 08:25.273
<i>Zero, security room is clear.</i>

08:25.275 --> 08:27.402
- Patching you in now.
- <i>Copy that.</i>

08:29.195 --> 08:31.738
Have eyes on the interior. Looks lovely.

08:31.740 --> 08:33.698
I'll get you a souvenir T-shirt.

08:33.700 --> 08:36.619
- <i>Bravo Two, sitrep.</i>
- All good. On my way.

08:40.248 --> 08:42.914
- Where is Odise?
- Uh, Odise went for coffee.

08:42.917 --> 08:45.585
But he sent me
to get him the coffee.

08:45.587 --> 08:47.837
Well, I guess he got impatient.

08:47.839 --> 08:51.758
You're not supposed to be here.
I'm going to speak to my manager.

08:51.760 --> 08:54.093
Listen, I... look, it's my buddy's
bachelor party,

08:54.095 --> 08:56.804
and I just wanted to get some
footage of him in the VIP room.

08:56.806 --> 08:58.433
Please, please, please.

09:00.685 --> 09:05.855
- I never saw you. You never saw me.
- We are like ships in the wind.

09:05.857 --> 09:11.861
- We're shits in the wind?
- No, ships. Ships with a P.

09:11.863 --> 09:13.448
Oh.

09:15.241 --> 09:20.036
- You know, you're almost kinda cute.
- Huh.

09:20.038 --> 09:23.416
So, um, how long is Odise gone for?

09:26.378 --> 09:30.963
I would say he's gonna be gone a...
little while.

09:30.965 --> 09:33.218
- Oh.
- Yeah.

09:34.552 --> 09:35.970
Oh, fuck.

09:44.187 --> 09:47.355
Eyes on Alpha Two. Bar area.

09:47.357 --> 09:51.861
That woman there approaching,
that's the wife, Arianna Demachi.

09:53.988 --> 09:56.364
Drink it.

09:56.366 --> 10:01.371
You're getting married in two days.
Drink it.

10:05.166 --> 10:09.212
- You're lucky.
- I'm blessed.

10:10.505 --> 10:13.548
- You get to inherit it all.
- What if I don't want it?

10:13.550 --> 10:15.385
What you want does not matter.

10:17.387 --> 10:20.596
Monika is going to accompany you
to the VIP room.

10:20.598 --> 10:24.185
- She's going to take care of you.
- This isn't necessary.

10:25.437 --> 10:28.521
Stare at the fucking ceiling
if you want.

10:28.523 --> 10:31.441
Or think about one of your boyfriends,
I don't care.

10:31.443 --> 10:34.569
But this club is full of your father's
associates,

10:34.571 --> 10:37.407
and you're going to start acting
like his son.

10:43.371 --> 10:44.912
<i>Alpha Two on the move.</i>

10:44.914 --> 10:47.248
<i>Heading for VIP lounges with a dancer.</i>

10:47.250 --> 10:49.959
<i>Copy that, following.
Bravo Two, you coming or what?</i>

10:49.961 --> 10:53.963
Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just, uh...
just double-checking things back here.

10:53.965 --> 10:56.507
<i>Turning off cameras in the VIP room.</i>

10:56.509 --> 10:58.428
Bravo One, you're clear to engage.

11:01.681 --> 11:04.851
Go and freshen up. Give me
and me mate here five minutes.

11:11.066 --> 11:12.815
My name's Sergeant Thomas McAllister.

11:12.817 --> 11:15.320
I'm with a covert anti-terrorism unit.
I need your help.

11:18.073 --> 11:20.406
Bravo Two, are you still
in the security room?

11:20.408 --> 11:24.369
- <i>Yeah, yeah, still here.</i>
- You have tangos inbound.

11:24.371 --> 11:27.413
We don't have much time,
so this is what I can promise you.

11:27.415 --> 11:30.375
Nobody gets hurt, nobody gets harmed.
We just want the weapon.

11:30.377 --> 11:33.669
- Do you know who I am?
- Obviously. Why else would I be here?

11:33.671 --> 11:35.630
I am a Demachi. I fear nothing.

11:35.632 --> 11:38.383
- Not even clowns?
- Clowns?

11:38.385 --> 11:41.928
<i>Yeah. Massive shoes, painted face,
big red nose.</i>

11:41.930 --> 11:44.305
<i>Fucking hell, Loric. We can do this
the easy or the hard way.</i>

11:44.307 --> 11:46.724
I'm giving you a choice here, mate.

11:46.726 --> 11:50.478
- We gotta move. There's people coming.
- Uh, yes. That would be the security.

11:50.480 --> 11:53.940
I pressed the panic button while
we were finishing making the love.

11:53.942 --> 11:55.817
I'm sorry. You called them?

11:55.819 --> 11:58.861
Your story about bachelor party
sounded like bullshit,

11:58.863 --> 12:01.406
- and I don't want to lose my job.
- Huh.

12:01.408 --> 12:04.244
- But you are very cute.
- Thanks.

12:09.666 --> 12:11.418
Hey.

12:17.382 --> 12:19.092
Bye-bye.

12:27.142 --> 12:31.769
- On the house.
- Appreciate it. Thank you.

12:31.771 --> 12:35.982
- You're military.
- No, ma'am.

12:35.984 --> 12:39.110
- I'm just here on vacation.
- Of course.

12:39.112 --> 12:42.530
Like your little friend in the VIP room.

12:42.532 --> 12:45.700
- Huh.
- Easy way, hard way.

12:45.702 --> 12:49.495
It's not a choice, it's a demand.
Like I'm some fucking peasant.

12:49.497 --> 12:52.417
All right, hard way it is. Let's go.

12:58.006 --> 13:01.007
What did you think was going to happen?

13:01.009 --> 13:06.056
The Albanian families control
organized crime in London, New York...

13:09.392 --> 13:11.100
You know, that is a shitty move...

13:11.102 --> 13:13.770
offering someone a drink
and then taking it back.

13:13.772 --> 13:15.774
I'm glad you find this amusing.

13:16.816 --> 13:19.776
You know, my ex-wife used to say
I was an asshole.

13:19.778 --> 13:23.782
The thing about assholes is, they always
get your undivided attention.

13:35.418 --> 13:38.252
Weapons down, compadres. Weapons down.

13:38.254 --> 13:39.631
Get down!

13:51.351 --> 13:53.103
You're making a big mistake.

13:54.187 --> 13:56.189
Well, let's add it to the list, then,
huh?

13:59.234 --> 14:02.278
- Loric! Shit, Alpha Two's a runner.
- Moving.

14:13.623 --> 14:15.875
Don't let anyone through.

14:31.516 --> 14:33.266
Moving into the meat-packers. Hey!

14:33.268 --> 14:34.769
Hey.

14:49.325 --> 14:52.452
Clear right!

14:52.454 --> 14:54.539
Bravo Two, we're coming to you.

15:21.066 --> 15:26.237
Wyatt? Bloody hell. Where's Loric?

15:28.740 --> 15:31.949
- I was a little busy.
- Sitting around on your ass.

15:31.951 --> 15:33.618
Merry Christmas, dickhead.

15:33.620 --> 15:36.245
Zero, talk to me.
Has the asset made a run for it?

15:36.247 --> 15:39.665
<i>Negative, Alpha Two
is still in the building.</i>

15:39.667 --> 15:42.668
You have three incoming hostiles,
east side.

15:42.670 --> 15:44.212
<i>We're inbound for exfil.</i>

15:44.214 --> 15:46.047
More reinforcements will be coming.
You have two minutes.

15:46.049 --> 15:48.091
Contact!

15:48.093 --> 15:52.303
Right. Split up. I'll hold these off.

15:52.305 --> 15:54.516
Find the asset.

16:16.413 --> 16:17.956
<i>Bravo, sitrep.</i>

16:19.916 --> 16:22.208
Yeah, I got nothing.
I'm coming back your way.

16:22.210 --> 16:26.005
- <i>Copy that. Bravo Three?</i>
- Still searching.

16:30.677 --> 16:34.429
- Stay back.
- Bravo One, I found Loric.

16:34.431 --> 16:36.808
I'm warning you.

16:48.570 --> 16:53.408
Where is Loric? Where is he?

16:55.118 --> 16:56.786
I know how to use this.

17:00.415 --> 17:07.047
Knowing... and doing
isn't the same thing.

17:17.098 --> 17:20.183
Okay, easy, easy.

17:20.185 --> 17:23.313
Just so you know,
you've got the safety on.

17:35.075 --> 17:38.242
You touch me
and my father's gonna kill you.

17:38.244 --> 17:40.663
Like he killed your boyfriend?

17:51.508 --> 17:56.052
Your friend said if I helped...
my father wouldn't be harmed.

17:56.054 --> 18:00.807
- You have my word on that.
- What if I wanted him hurt?

18:00.809 --> 18:03.061
<i>What about that?</i>

18:04.479 --> 18:08.606
If you want that, it can be arranged
if you know where the bioweapon is.

18:08.608 --> 18:11.859
I don't. I just know that
there is a deal going down today

18:11.861 --> 18:13.653
and I'm meant to be part of it.

18:13.655 --> 18:16.324
"Time to step up and be a fucking man."

18:19.994 --> 18:22.706
It's a tracker. Press here to activate.

18:26.584 --> 18:28.211
We'll do the rest.

18:30.380 --> 18:33.047
Bravo One,
Alpha Two objective confirmed.

18:33.049 --> 18:34.592
- Heading for exfil.
- I mean it.

18:36.136 --> 18:38.052
If something were to happen to him,

18:38.054 --> 18:40.849
I mean, that would be
a pretty good day for Loric.

18:58.575 --> 19:02.662
They wanted me to help them. I wouldn't.

19:18.428 --> 19:20.055
I'll handle this.

19:21.806 --> 19:23.391
Mr. Vironi.

19:24.768 --> 19:28.269
Arianna. As beautiful as always.

19:28.271 --> 19:32.315
We weren't expecting you. Come inside.

19:32.317 --> 19:34.734
Are there details of the wedding
you wish to discuss?

19:34.736 --> 19:40.948
Uh... I hear you had some trouble
in Venice and then today in downtown.

19:40.950 --> 19:43.661
Oh, it's nothing to be concerned about.

19:44.996 --> 19:46.746
You don't get to decide that.

19:46.748 --> 19:50.041
Your wife was so persuasive,

19:50.043 --> 19:54.796
convinced me this union was a good idea,
but I changed my mind.

19:54.798 --> 19:57.507
I will not let my daughter
join your family.

19:57.509 --> 20:01.803
- We had an agreement.
- And now the agreement is broken.

20:01.805 --> 20:04.430
No. For years, we've been
kept down by this blood feud.

20:04.432 --> 20:08.393
- Don't turn your back on me!
- Edon, Edon.

20:08.395 --> 20:11.771
Mr. Vironi, I didn't mean no disrespect.

20:11.773 --> 20:17.694
Edon... you can try and hide it, but...

20:17.696 --> 20:22.534
your family will always be
mountain trash.

21:04.909 --> 21:08.872
- You have killed us.
- No.

21:11.666 --> 21:14.042
He is the head of a family.

21:14.044 --> 21:15.835
A <i>krye.</i>

21:15.837 --> 21:22.050
- There's no turning back from this.
- He got what he deserved.

21:22.052 --> 21:27.096
To lay hands on the head of our house?
On my fucking husband?

21:27.098 --> 21:31.267
Arianna... we're as good as dead.

21:31.269 --> 21:34.520
Bodies disappear.
Money solves everything.

21:34.522 --> 21:38.399
- Oh, my.
- So you make the deal happen.

21:38.401 --> 21:40.485
And you save our family.

21:40.487 --> 21:46.115
- You're fucking crazy.
- But was I wrong, Edon?

21:46.117 --> 21:48.703
- Hmm.
- Was I wrong?

21:54.209 --> 21:58.421
No. He got what he deserved.

22:02.467 --> 22:06.137
I'll do the deal. This can be fixed.

22:09.391 --> 22:11.683
<i>Do you think the son
will come through for us?</i>

22:11.685 --> 22:16.856
- Yeah. I got a feeling he will, boss.
- Well, let's hope you're right.

22:19.025 --> 22:21.277
You given our discussion
any more thought?

22:22.737 --> 22:25.655
- I'm still thinking about it, boss.
- He's gonna do it.

22:25.657 --> 22:27.490
Boy's got officer written all over him.

22:27.492 --> 22:30.912
For what it's worth, if you were my CO,
I'd be happy to follow you.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.127
All right, fuck it. I guess I'm in.

22:39.129 --> 22:42.839
Good, now forget about it
and concentrate on the op at hand.

22:42.841 --> 22:45.842
We move as soon as Loric
activates that tracker.

22:45.844 --> 22:50.221
- Solid copy on that, boss.
- That was very mature of you, Wyatt.

22:50.223 --> 22:52.682
Well, now he owes me all the beers,
right?

22:52.684 --> 22:54.934
Sure you're okay about it?

22:54.936 --> 22:57.061
It's kinda like the family breaking up,
you know?

22:57.063 --> 22:59.983
Ah, don't worry about me, short stuff.
I'll be fine.

23:32.015 --> 23:34.392
Wait here.

23:56.915 --> 23:59.040
Zero Alpha,
Loric's activated the tracker.

23:59.042 --> 24:01.419
Kid came through. Game on.

24:16.393 --> 24:20.311
- Get out.
- What is it?

24:20.313 --> 24:21.940
I said out.

24:41.376 --> 24:45.837
My father was angry at everything.
Blood debt, life.

24:45.839 --> 24:48.923
Even on his deathbed,
he wouldn't let it go.

24:48.925 --> 24:51.094
I told myself I'm gonna be different.

24:53.930 --> 24:56.597
Everything I have done
has been to protect you,

24:56.599 --> 24:58.643
so don't fucking expect me
to apologize for that.

25:12.449 --> 25:16.703
I don't trust these jihadi bastards,
so I'm not gonna risk you.

25:17.996 --> 25:20.707
He's gonna take you home.

25:26.713 --> 25:32.427
- Wait.
- Go fucking home, son.

25:45.815 --> 25:48.443
They're about ten minutes ahead of us,
heading towards Kashar station.

25:55.617 --> 25:59.496
<i>Eyes on. Interior and exterior.
We know the deal's going down somewhere.</i>

26:05.668 --> 26:07.921
Possible sighting. Moving to intercept.

26:24.688 --> 26:30.525
This is you, yeah?
You work for Mahir, yeah?

26:30.527 --> 26:33.361
- You don't need to hurt me.
- We'll see about that.

26:33.363 --> 26:37.907
Details of the meet.
I'm not fucking around here, mate.

26:37.909 --> 26:39.786
What are you, police?

26:41.037 --> 26:45.331
No... Military, yes.

26:45.333 --> 26:48.292
Always good when your kind come here.

26:48.294 --> 26:50.294
Tell us what to do, how to live.

26:50.296 --> 26:55.049
When you're trying to buy a bioweapon,
you don't get the moral high ground.

26:55.051 --> 27:00.682
- 15:05 Tirana-Shkoder train.
- Yeah, moving.

27:02.559 --> 27:04.269
Right. Sit down, dickhead.

27:08.898 --> 27:13.234
- Tell me about Zayef.
- People say he will change everything.

27:13.236 --> 27:16.197
I'm not looking for a horoscope.
I want some hard facts.

27:17.949 --> 27:21.242
Zayef is Mahir's brother.

27:21.244 --> 27:25.830
Their parents died in the conflict.
In the massacres.

27:25.832 --> 27:28.126
And the UN soldiers...

27:31.546 --> 27:35.339
They just gave them candy bars
as consolation.

27:35.341 --> 27:40.638
Can you imagine that?
The bodies... the smell?

27:42.015 --> 27:45.310
And some pale pink candy.

27:47.812 --> 27:50.229
That's all I know.

27:50.231 --> 27:52.023
<i>Bravos, sitrep.</i>

27:52.025 --> 27:55.193
Yeah boss, I'm right on your six.
Almost there.

27:55.195 --> 27:58.696
I think you know more. I'll be back.

27:58.698 --> 28:02.369
No, you won't be back.

28:04.579 --> 28:11.250
No... no, please don't!
No! Someone help! Please don't!

28:11.252 --> 28:14.297
Help me! Help!

28:35.443 --> 28:38.528
Train's on the move.
Zero Alpha on board.

28:38.530 --> 28:40.738
- Well, let's get after it.
- It's gonna be tricky, though.

28:40.740 --> 28:42.865
There's no road access
for another 20 miles.

28:42.867 --> 28:44.867
The train goes across bridges, ravines.

28:44.869 --> 28:46.953
All right, Wyatt, track in the vehicle
best you can.

28:46.955 --> 28:48.873
Chetri, with me. I've got an idea.

29:03.096 --> 29:05.306
Eyes on Alpha Three and two associates.

29:06.808 --> 29:09.267
<i>If I see the package,
will move to engage.</i>

29:09.269 --> 29:11.310
All right, we're doing our best
to catch up.

29:11.312 --> 29:13.606
- Bravo One, sitrep.
- <i>One minute, Wyatt.</i>

29:16.735 --> 29:19.861
All right, mate. Break's over.
We're gonna need a lift.

29:19.863 --> 29:21.781
Drive.

29:23.450 --> 29:25.450
<i>Okay, team, we are mobile.</i>

29:25.452 --> 29:28.079
<i>Zero Alpha, hang on.
We've got a bit of catching up to do.</i>

29:31.458 --> 29:34.085
Copy that. May have to go it alone.

29:42.719 --> 29:44.554
Okay, okay.

29:46.890 --> 29:48.349
Don't.

29:51.811 --> 29:54.937
Your people shouldn't have
come after my son.

29:54.939 --> 29:58.566
We didn't harm him.
Now let's talk about the weapon.

29:58.568 --> 30:01.027
You're not an idiot,
despite appearances.

30:01.029 --> 30:02.653
You don't trust the buyers,

30:02.655 --> 30:04.489
so you arrange a meet on a train
to avoid an ambush.

30:04.491 --> 30:06.407
I presume you put a tracker
on the weapon

30:06.409 --> 30:07.950
in case of a double-cross.

30:07.952 --> 30:11.373
Like you said,
despite appearances.

30:12.582 --> 30:15.416
I'm willing to make you a deal,
even back you up.

30:15.418 --> 30:19.339
You can keep their money.
We just want the weapon.

30:23.301 --> 30:26.761
Sorry. It was my family.

30:26.763 --> 30:29.099
No deal and no mercy.

31:05.427 --> 31:08.344
So let's get this done.

31:08.346 --> 31:12.559
No more tests, no more talk.
Show me the money.

31:23.987 --> 31:25.447
The product?

32:18.875 --> 32:21.419
Zero Alpha, hang on.
We're coming to you.

32:27.926 --> 32:30.009
<i>Zero Alpha,
we've got a visual on the train.</i>

32:30.011 --> 32:32.136
<i>Closing in.</i>

32:32.138 --> 32:33.681
Last carriage. Could use a hand.

32:35.392 --> 32:39.145
<i>Feel free to take a shot. Any shot.</i>

32:44.651 --> 32:47.902
Fuck, Wyatt!
Swerve a bit more, why don't you?

32:47.904 --> 32:50.490
I'm chasing a moving train.
What do you expect?

33:14.139 --> 33:16.266
Come on!

33:25.734 --> 33:27.819
Oh, shit.

33:45.295 --> 33:47.255
Uh, boss?

33:57.057 --> 34:01.102
- Sergeant, how did you...
- Caught a train, boss.

34:03.104 --> 34:05.104
Principals are in the central
carriage compartment.

34:05.106 --> 34:07.523
- ROE?
- Shoot to kill.

34:07.525 --> 34:08.985
The package is the priority.

34:16.201 --> 34:22.831
You have been most honorable about this.
Zayef appreciates it.

34:24.042 --> 34:27.962
There's no honor about it.
It's business, nothing else.

35:25.812 --> 35:27.564
What the fuck?

35:53.465 --> 35:56.549
Boss, cavalry has arrived!

35:56.551 --> 35:59.969
<i>Demachi and Mahir are on the train,
but the weapon is our priority.</i>

35:59.971 --> 36:03.141
<i>Shoot to kill. Retrieve the package.</i>

36:09.189 --> 36:11.689
- Demachi's put a tracker on the virus.
- All right, I'm on it.

36:11.691 --> 36:13.316
Move, move. Come on, move.

36:13.318 --> 36:15.485
I'll extract the civilians.
You secure the tracker.

36:15.487 --> 36:17.155
- You good?
- Yeah.

36:21.201 --> 36:23.078
Go, go, go!

36:32.796 --> 36:35.380
Did you guys steal a fucking train?

36:35.382 --> 36:37.425
That old thing? Yeah.

36:51.898 --> 36:55.068
Shit, Mahir is taking off
with the package.

36:58.571 --> 37:00.907
Go mobile!

37:02.867 --> 37:04.909
- Come on!
- We're losing them, damn it!

37:04.911 --> 37:07.163
- Get it going!
- Fuck's sake!

37:19.384 --> 37:21.094
Fuck!

37:30.562 --> 37:32.605
Bravo One, sitrep!

37:34.024 --> 37:35.648
Bravo One.

37:35.650 --> 37:37.485
Mac, come in, buddy.

37:40.864 --> 37:43.908
- Bravo One, do you copy?
- Mac, sitrep!

37:49.539 --> 37:51.622
- Get in!
- Mac, come on!

37:51.624 --> 37:53.710
Go, go, go, go.

38:01.468 --> 38:04.512
<i>Mac, come in. Do you copy?</i>

38:10.810 --> 38:13.104
Mac, come in. Do you copy?

38:19.903 --> 38:23.031
I'm up, I'm up. Mostly.

38:24.366 --> 38:26.451
It's good to hear your voice.

38:28.161 --> 38:31.204
Alpha One is on the run. Going foxtrot.

38:31.206 --> 38:33.164
I'm in pursuit.

38:33.166 --> 38:35.041
We need Demachi's tracker.

38:35.043 --> 38:38.503
<i>Repeat, we need Demachi's tracker.</i>

38:38.505 --> 38:40.463
It's our only way to locate the weapon.

38:40.465 --> 38:42.300
Right, fucking tracker. I'm on it.

40:20.523 --> 40:23.941
- Baba?
- <i>Loric, Loric.</i>

40:23.943 --> 40:25.860
<i>I was right to send you home.</i>

40:25.862 --> 40:28.696
<i>The British are after me.</i>

40:28.698 --> 40:33.036
<i>Listen... tell your mom I love her
and...</i>

40:36.331 --> 40:38.249
<i>Loric...</i>

40:40.877 --> 40:43.505
I... I'm sorry for everything.

40:44.714 --> 40:47.467
Baba. Baba?

40:51.096 --> 40:52.847
Drop it.

40:57.227 --> 41:00.561
You can walk away from this.
We just want the tracker.

41:00.563 --> 41:06.403
No can do.
You went after my family.

41:07.862 --> 41:09.989
Yeah, and you went after mine.

41:36.266 --> 41:38.474
Zero, I have a fix on the package.

41:38.476 --> 41:43.896
<i>Grid reference 2-4-7-9-5-8-8-1.</i>

41:43.898 --> 41:46.526
Copy that. Good work.

42:08.423 --> 42:11.257
I was worried about you.

42:11.259 --> 42:13.885
It is not my time. Not yet.

42:13.887 --> 42:17.724
We leave now. Be sure to leave no trace.

42:23.521 --> 42:26.024
Whoa.

42:30.945 --> 42:33.321
It's too dangerous. We have to go.

42:33.323 --> 42:36.076
- No, we need it...
- I'm not asking you.

42:38.078 --> 42:40.078
We have sacrificed too much already.

42:40.080 --> 42:42.622
If the men can bring it back,
they will bring it back.

42:42.624 --> 42:44.417
This changes nothing.

42:47.754 --> 42:50.505
- We got Mahir on the move.
- Fuck!

42:50.507 --> 42:53.093
Bioweapon is the priority.

43:00.975 --> 43:03.685
Oh, shit, the virus is live!
The virus is live!

43:03.687 --> 43:06.147
We have to incinerate it!

43:07.691 --> 43:09.484
I've got this.

43:33.007 --> 43:35.967
Did that work? Or are we still
breathing that shit in?

43:35.969 --> 43:39.554
Incineration wipes out
all microbial pathogens.

43:39.556 --> 43:42.223
I think what the lance corporal's
saying...

43:42.225 --> 43:43.977
You might've just done it, short stuff.

43:45.395 --> 43:49.357
But, I'd never call you short stuff.

43:51.484 --> 43:53.486
Fucking better not.

44:07.208 --> 44:10.003
Additional CIA intel's
just come through on Mahir.

44:13.882 --> 44:16.134
Wait, wait. What's it say about him
there on the left?

44:17.343 --> 44:19.763
Apparently that's Mahir's
younger brother, Zed.

44:21.347 --> 44:23.473
Also known as Zayef.

44:23.475 --> 44:27.143
- But that's him? That's the leader?
- I had him at the station. I had him.

44:27.145 --> 44:29.395
At least you had him.
None of us got that close.

44:29.397 --> 44:31.397
- Well, he had him and let him go.
- Yeah.

44:31.399 --> 44:34.025
- I wasn't gonna be an asshole about it.
- I take your point.

44:34.027 --> 44:36.569
There's something about this
that doesn't scan.

44:36.571 --> 44:40.365
Their records, their history...
nothing stands out,

44:40.367 --> 44:42.158
and yet they had the money
for this operation.

44:42.160 --> 44:45.203
<i>Men, arms, funding.</i>

44:45.205 --> 44:48.581
<i>Then they got the bioweapon and they
threw it away as if it were nothing.</i>

44:48.583 --> 44:50.208
<i>And that worries me.</i>

44:50.210 --> 44:53.086
Because if they can leave
something that dangerous behind,

44:53.088 --> 44:57.717
it means something far worse
is coming down the line.

45:31.668 --> 45:34.879
It is the Kanun. Gjakmarrja.

45:36.715 --> 45:38.591
The blood feud.

45:41.219 --> 45:44.931
We shall not rest,
not until our dying breath,

45:46.266 --> 45:49.894
until each and every single one of them
is dead.
