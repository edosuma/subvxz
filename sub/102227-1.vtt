WEBVTT

02:53.217 --> 02:56.551
Okay.

03:11.597 --> 03:12.665
Yeah, come in.

03:14.800 --> 03:16.268
Hey.

03:16.302 --> 03:18.436
Sorry to wake up you, but
you left your phone out here,

03:18.469 --> 03:21.505
and Chief has called
you a few times.

03:23.174 --> 03:25.541
Thanks, I'll call him.

03:25.574 --> 03:28.345
Hey, try not to
stay up too late.

03:28.378 --> 03:30.347
We're just hanging out.

03:30.380 --> 03:31.213
Mm hm.

03:32.048 --> 03:32.982
Yeah right.

03:35.117 --> 03:37.786
Turn your fuckin'
music down, dude.

03:39.854 --> 03:42.222
Hey, sorry I missed your calls.

03:42.256 --> 03:43.057
I went to bed early.

03:47.794 --> 03:51.630
I thought you wanted me to
take the Westwater tour?

03:53.265 --> 03:55.200
Okay, sure, no problem.

03:58.601 --> 03:59.437
You, too.

03:59.469 --> 04:01.372
See you in the morning.

05:11.695 --> 05:13.662
- There she is.
- Hey, there.

05:13.696 --> 05:14.731
I brought you some coffee.

05:14.765 --> 05:16.767
- You're a lifesaver.
- I know.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.000
So, what's up?

05:18.034 --> 05:19.335
Why'd you pull me from
the Westwater trip.

05:19.368 --> 05:21.203
Alex is really sick.

05:21.237 --> 05:22.904
Food poisoning or something.

05:22.937 --> 05:24.272
Is he gonna be okay?

05:24.305 --> 05:26.640
Yeah,
yeah, he'll be fine.

05:26.673 --> 05:29.609
But he can't do the
Canyonlands trip tomorrow.

05:29.642 --> 05:30.477
And?

05:31.577 --> 05:34.013
Well, I was hoping-

05:35.580 --> 05:37.316
- That I would do it?

05:38.984 --> 05:39.818
Yeah.

05:42.254 --> 05:43.921
Look, I know it's not
your favorite place.

05:43.954 --> 05:45.790
Not my favorite place?

05:45.823 --> 05:47.058
I almost died there!

05:47.091 --> 05:48.893
A man's in a wheelchair
for the rest of his life

05:48.926 --> 05:50.093
because of what I-

05:50.126 --> 05:52.228
- It's not your fault.
- It is my fault!

05:52.262 --> 05:54.230
Okay, can't Scott do it?

05:54.264 --> 05:56.765
He's not as good as you.

05:57.733 --> 05:58.934
It's for those contest winners,

05:58.967 --> 06:00.334
and I don't wanna screw it up.

06:00.368 --> 06:02.370
This is such bullshit.

06:04.505 --> 06:05.704
You know I wouldn't ask you

06:05.739 --> 06:07.407
if I didn't think
you could do it.

06:07.441 --> 06:08.942
The company needs you.

06:08.975 --> 06:12.511
I need you.

06:12.545 --> 06:14.046
Nice.

06:14.080 --> 06:16.147
Way to guilt trip me.

06:16.181 --> 06:18.682
Seriously, I need you.

06:18.716 --> 06:21.485
I took you in when
you were what, six?

06:21.518 --> 06:23.420
Now look at you.

06:23.454 --> 06:26.989
You know this place
better than I do.

06:27.023 --> 06:29.759
I just don't
wanna let you down.

06:29.792 --> 06:30.793
You won't.

06:34.930 --> 06:37.198
Fine, I'll do it.

06:37.231 --> 06:38.466
Great.

06:38.499 --> 06:39.967
Thank you.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.535
Be here in the morning and
I'll drive the guests over.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.971
- How many people?
- Five.

06:45.004 --> 06:46.773
Okay, I can handle that.

06:46.806 --> 06:48.540
I know you can.

06:48.574 --> 06:52.077
Hit a few easy rapids, you
know, show 'em a good time.

06:52.111 --> 06:53.011
I'm gonna go check on the gear

06:53.045 --> 06:55.213
and make sure it's all good.

06:55.246 --> 06:57.281
Any other surprises?

06:57.315 --> 06:59.416
Check in with Rob
before you head out.

06:59.449 --> 07:02.052
He'll go over some
things with you.

07:02.085 --> 07:03.919
And no more surprises.

07:05.054 --> 07:06.188
Is he in the garage?

07:06.222 --> 07:07.056
Yeah.

07:08.656 --> 07:09.991
And don't worry,
I'll take care of all

07:10.024 --> 07:11.692
the important people for you.

07:11.726 --> 07:13.361
Only you can do it.

07:13.394 --> 07:15.295
Mm, that's hilarious.

07:22.468 --> 07:23.302
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:24.737 --> 07:26.670
Chief says you're taking the
contest winners out tomorrow?

07:26.705 --> 07:27.873
Funny, I just agreed to that,

07:27.906 --> 07:29.673
so he must've been
confident I'd say yes.

07:29.708 --> 07:31.575
Ah, yeah, you know Chief.

07:31.609 --> 07:34.245
It's like he's got
ESP sometimes I think.

07:34.278 --> 07:35.146
How's your ankle?

07:35.179 --> 07:37.013
Ah, it's okay.

07:37.046 --> 07:38.748
Easier than dealing
with this trip.

07:38.781 --> 07:40.817
Bunch of spoiled millennials.

07:40.850 --> 07:42.217
You know you're a
millennial, right?

07:42.251 --> 07:44.286
Yeah and I suck.

07:44.319 --> 07:45.721
That's true.

07:45.754 --> 07:49.023
But you know I love babysitting
a bunch of whiny kids, so.

07:49.056 --> 07:50.258
It's one overnight.

07:50.291 --> 07:52.392
You'll be back
before you know it.

07:52.425 --> 07:54.361
That's easy for you to say.

07:54.394 --> 07:56.429
You owe me a beer
when I get back.

07:56.463 --> 07:58.030
I'll buy you two.

07:59.398 --> 08:01.500
What else do I need
to know about them?

08:51.273 --> 08:52.775
Awesome.

08:58.947 --> 09:00.114
Hey, guys.

09:00.148 --> 09:01.448
I'm Lauren, I'm
gonna be your guide.

09:01.481 --> 09:02.950
A little bit about me.

09:02.983 --> 09:04.918
I was born and raised right
here in Southeastern Utah.

09:04.952 --> 09:06.719
I've been rafting and
guiding in this area

09:06.752 --> 09:08.854
since I was 14 years old.

09:08.888 --> 09:10.122
- So, you're in good hands.
- She knows the river

09:10.156 --> 09:12.057
better than I do.

09:12.090 --> 09:14.694
I don't know if that's
true, but how about you?

09:14.726 --> 09:16.994
Where are you from?

09:17.027 --> 09:18.762
Hey, guys.

09:18.796 --> 09:21.165
I'm Sarah and I live in Phoenix.

09:21.198 --> 09:24.601
I'm a social media
influencer and I can't wait

09:24.634 --> 09:26.769
to share my trip with
all my followers.

09:28.103 --> 09:29.838
So, what up, y'all, I'm Ryan.

09:29.871 --> 09:33.507
I'm out from L.A., training to
be an MMA fighter, you know?

09:33.541 --> 09:34.942
Super stoked for
this trip, you know?

09:34.976 --> 09:36.510
And especially the 5k, right?

09:36.544 --> 09:37.378
Woo, yeah!

09:39.813 --> 09:42.115
Cool, all right, Ryan.

09:42.148 --> 09:44.617
Yeah, who wouldn't
wanna win a free 5k?

09:44.650 --> 09:45.451
That's cool.

09:45.484 --> 09:46.652
How about you?

09:49.087 --> 09:51.256
Uh, hello, everybody.

09:51.289 --> 09:54.791
Uh, my name's Kyle and
I'm from Las Vegas.

09:56.593 --> 10:01.163
And uh, I am into computer
software design and bitcoin.

10:02.164 --> 10:03.899
Nerd alert.

10:03.933 --> 10:07.670
Okay, no, not on
my trip, all right?

10:07.703 --> 10:09.137
What up, crew?

10:09.170 --> 10:12.139
I'm Dave, I'm from Denver
and I'm in the weed business.

10:12.172 --> 10:13.207
I'm here to have a good time.

10:13.240 --> 10:14.575
You will, you will.

10:14.608 --> 10:16.042
Last one.

10:16.075 --> 10:17.277
Uh, what's up?

10:17.310 --> 10:20.280
I'm Jennifer, I'm
from Salt Lake City,

10:20.313 --> 10:22.781
and I work at a climbing gym.

10:22.814 --> 10:24.016
Dope.

10:24.049 --> 10:25.550
All right, well, great
to meet all of you.

10:25.584 --> 10:27.985
We will be on the river
for two days and one night,

10:28.019 --> 10:30.655
and then we will meet Chief
on the other side of the park.

10:30.689 --> 10:32.555
There's gonna be a
lunch with a presentation

10:32.589 --> 10:34.958
of your checks when
we reach the end.

10:34.991 --> 10:35.925
That's what I'm talking about.

10:35.959 --> 10:37.293
Show me the money!

10:37.326 --> 10:38.160
- Yes!
- Wow.

10:39.328 --> 10:41.363
Uh, any other questions?

10:41.397 --> 10:44.065
Uh, yeah, is there gonna
be like cell service there?

10:44.098 --> 10:45.833
Eh, no.

10:45.867 --> 10:47.268
There's not gonna
be any cell service.

10:49.704 --> 10:51.838
- No, I'm serious.
- Wait, what?

10:51.872 --> 10:54.373
Uh, but I'll have a sat
phone for emergencies.

10:54.407 --> 10:57.343
And other than that we will
be completely off the grid.

10:57.376 --> 10:59.010
Any other questions?

11:00.312 --> 11:03.480
Cool, let's head to the raft.

11:13.523 --> 11:17.926
So, um, we will be at the
pickup point at 10:00 a.m.,

11:19.428 --> 11:21.395
the day after tomorrow.

11:21.429 --> 11:24.165
There's been a lot of
rain and with the snow melt

11:24.198 --> 11:26.132
all sorts of debris
is floating around.

11:26.166 --> 11:28.635
So, keep an eye out for
logs and submerged boulders.

11:28.669 --> 11:29.903
Okay, will do.

11:29.936 --> 11:33.439
Trust me, I don't
wanna flip again.

11:33.472 --> 11:35.240
You should camp
near Claret Mine.

11:35.274 --> 11:38.576
It's away from the river
a bit, so no mosquitoes.

11:38.609 --> 11:40.812
Okay, good point.

11:43.681 --> 11:45.849
How am I supposed to
post with no cell service?

11:45.882 --> 11:46.916
Just post your pics after.

11:46.949 --> 11:48.918
You know, TBT, Flashback Friday.

11:48.951 --> 11:50.920
But I promised
everyone live updates.

11:50.953 --> 11:52.153
Guess they'll
just have to live

11:52.187 --> 11:53.388
without you for
a days, princess.

11:53.421 --> 11:55.357
Just smoke some weed
and enjoy the trip.

11:55.390 --> 11:57.624
Great, that's all we need
is you smokin' blunts all day.

11:57.659 --> 11:58.892
Blunts?

11:58.926 --> 12:00.060
Hell nah, you think
I'm gonna ruin

12:00.094 --> 12:01.696
a good smoke with that shit?

12:01.730 --> 12:04.832
You think just because
I'm black I smoke blunts?

12:04.864 --> 12:06.032
Whatever, man, all right.

12:06.065 --> 12:06.999
Just keep the
smoke away from me.

12:07.033 --> 12:09.501
I gotta piss in a cup in a week.

12:09.534 --> 12:13.304
Uh, I heard this company
dumped a raft here before

12:13.337 --> 12:14.972
and people got hurt.

12:15.841 --> 12:16.641
What?

12:16.675 --> 12:18.108
Where did you hear that?

12:18.141 --> 12:19.509
Last night at dinner.

12:19.542 --> 12:21.611
I was sitting next to a local.

12:21.645 --> 12:23.046
What happened?

12:23.079 --> 12:24.279
He didn't exactly
know what happened,

12:24.313 --> 12:26.850
just that people
ended up in the water.

12:26.882 --> 12:29.016
Were stranded for days.

12:29.050 --> 12:30.885
Oh, shit, we're all gonna die.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.220
Shut up.

12:32.253 --> 12:33.621
I'm sure it's gonna be fine.

12:33.655 --> 12:35.122
And how would you know?

12:35.155 --> 12:37.157
Because I've done tons of
rafting trips like this, okay?

12:37.190 --> 12:39.860
It's not gonna be
anything crazy.

12:41.160 --> 12:42.361
Whatever, I need
to take a selfie,

12:42.395 --> 12:44.896
make a post, and
video chat my dog.

12:49.367 --> 12:51.068
Damn, she's hot.

12:51.101 --> 12:53.805
Hm, not really my type.

12:53.838 --> 12:56.372
And what exactly is a
social media influencer?

12:56.406 --> 12:58.341
Come on, bro, you're telling
me you wouldn't hit that?

12:58.374 --> 13:00.777
I think she means like an
Insta model or something.

13:00.810 --> 13:02.444
And yes, I would hit that.

13:02.477 --> 13:03.979
Damn!

13:04.012 --> 13:07.081
So, later, you, me and her
can you know, have some fun?

13:07.114 --> 13:08.349
Absolutely not.

13:08.382 --> 13:11.518
Also I'm gay and if
you touch me you die.

13:13.987 --> 13:15.388
That went well.

13:16.456 --> 13:18.658
- Shut up.
- What, what I say?

13:30.333 --> 13:33.436
I've learned it's best to
shut up when people tell me to.

13:33.469 --> 13:37.373
So, maybe you should do
as he says and shut up.

13:43.812 --> 13:46.947
Why does everyone keep
telling me to shut up?

13:49.582 --> 13:51.217
All I'm saying is be careful.

13:51.250 --> 13:53.754
Keep an eye out from trouble.

13:53.787 --> 13:56.054
I don't wanna come
looking for you again.

13:56.087 --> 13:57.690
Okay, enough already.

13:57.723 --> 13:59.891
Let's talking about what happened
last time I went out here.

13:59.925 --> 14:02.426
Don't worry, everything's
gonna be fine.

14:34.285 --> 14:36.821
I could
get used to this.

14:36.855 --> 14:39.356
I shoulda brought
some more weed.

14:39.389 --> 14:41.391
Best to stay alert.

14:41.425 --> 14:42.860
The river gets lonely.

14:42.893 --> 14:46.429
She will pull you under
if she feels like it.

14:46.462 --> 14:48.898
So, when did
people live out here?

14:48.931 --> 14:51.132
Tribes have been here
for thousands of years.

14:51.166 --> 14:53.735
There's a bunch of cliff
dwellings hidden up in the caves

14:53.768 --> 14:57.605
and you can see pictographs
and petroglyphs.

14:57.639 --> 14:59.606
Damn, sounds
like a rough life.

14:59.640 --> 15:02.008
Yeah, but they ate a
shit ton of peyote though.

15:02.041 --> 15:02.877
So what?

15:03.776 --> 15:05.077
So, peyote's fun as hell.

15:05.110 --> 15:06.613
I would totally eat
that shit out here.

15:06.646 --> 15:09.413
- Trip my balls off.
- Yeah, sounds like a blast.

15:09.447 --> 15:10.548
Well, I didn't
bring any peyote,

15:10.581 --> 15:12.049
but I did pack some beers.

15:12.083 --> 15:13.918
Woo, ah yeah.

15:15.318 --> 15:17.053
So, are most of the
native tribes still here?

15:17.087 --> 15:20.022
Yeah, well, there's five
native tribes to Utah,

15:20.055 --> 15:22.091
two in Canyonlands,
Navajo and Ute.

15:22.124 --> 15:23.627
But most of the tribes
didn't make it out when

15:23.660 --> 15:26.795
the miners and the
ranchers moved in.

15:26.829 --> 15:28.329
Manifest destiny.

15:44.710 --> 15:45.977
Hey, Sarah?

15:46.011 --> 15:47.177
Sarah?

15:47.211 --> 15:48.713
Can you grab your,
can you grab your oar?

15:48.747 --> 15:49.748
We need you.

15:50.749 --> 15:52.081
- Okay.
- Thanks.

15:53.316 --> 15:54.584
Yeah.

16:35.651 --> 16:36.752
You guys did awesome

16:36.786 --> 16:39.553
- on the rapids.
- Woo, that was sweet!

16:39.587 --> 16:41.790
- Fuck yeah it was.
- Yeah.

16:41.823 --> 16:42.991
The campsite's
not too far away,

16:43.024 --> 16:43.925
so we got a little
bit of a hike,

16:43.959 --> 16:46.259
but it shouldn't take long.

16:46.292 --> 16:48.261
Yeah and we got a
dark cloud rolling in,

16:48.294 --> 16:50.029
so let's keep moving.

16:50.964 --> 16:52.331
Hike?

16:52.364 --> 16:54.767
Yeah, it's just about
quarter of a mile or so.

16:54.801 --> 16:57.002
It's a real cool stretch and...

17:37.534 --> 17:39.335
Keep paddling.

17:39.369 --> 17:41.038
Keep paddling, Kyle.

18:15.132 --> 18:17.433
Uh, I thought this
was like a rafting trip,

18:17.466 --> 18:19.036
not a hiking trip.

18:19.069 --> 18:20.468
Well, you'll be glad we
got away from the river

18:20.502 --> 18:23.204
'cause there's tons of
mosquitoes down there.

18:23.238 --> 18:24.239
Lovely.

18:25.373 --> 18:26.741
- Oh, my God, I got a bar.
- That's not-

18:26.775 --> 18:27.842
- Are we almost there?

18:27.876 --> 18:29.144
I need to make a post.

18:29.176 --> 18:30.377
Are you
gonna be worried about

18:30.411 --> 18:33.047
- that this whole time?
- It's my job, okay?

18:33.080 --> 18:33.981
Just saying
you'd have more fun

18:34.014 --> 18:35.181
if you put your phone down.

18:36.448 --> 18:37.215
You guys, there's
a storm coming in.

18:37.249 --> 18:38.017
Let's speed it up.

20:03.920 --> 20:07.322
This is not
working on my face.

20:08.991 --> 20:09.792
Guys, I made a game.

20:09.825 --> 20:11.259
You wanna play?

20:11.292 --> 20:13.327
Nah, you know
I'm really, that's uh-

20:13.360 --> 20:14.528
Maybe later.

20:14.562 --> 20:15.964
- That's okay.
- I drew a circle

20:15.997 --> 20:17.264
and you throw rocks in it.

20:17.297 --> 20:19.767
God, it is so beautiful here!

20:19.800 --> 20:21.501
Just all the colors.

20:21.534 --> 20:24.269
It's pretty killer for sure.

20:24.302 --> 20:25.204
Are you gonna be on
a phone that doesn't

20:25.238 --> 20:27.372
have service the whole time?

20:27.405 --> 20:30.108
Are you gonna be smoking
weed the whole time?

20:30.142 --> 20:32.077
Hell yeah.

20:32.110 --> 20:34.779
I'm organizing
my posts for later.

20:34.812 --> 20:35.813
OMG, okay.

20:36.947 --> 20:38.149
If you guys need
to go to the bathroom

20:38.182 --> 20:39.916
just go a little
bit away from camp.

20:39.949 --> 20:41.050
There's a bunch of
old mines back there,

20:41.084 --> 20:43.186
so watch your footing.

20:43.219 --> 20:45.319
Are you kidding me?

20:45.353 --> 20:46.989
That's cheating.

20:47.022 --> 20:49.657
Yeah, so what?

21:17.013 --> 21:19.682
Could
you like help me?

21:20.817 --> 21:22.050
You know like, girls
are really good

21:22.083 --> 21:23.685
at like being like
sporty and stuff.

21:23.718 --> 21:25.720
- It's like a really cute look.
- Totally.

21:25.754 --> 21:27.387
So, that would
be like so much fun.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.156
Yeah,
that'd be so great.

21:29.190 --> 21:31.158
Like we could have
like slumber parties and stuff.

21:31.192 --> 21:32.092
- Totally, yeah.
- You know?

21:32.126 --> 21:33.525
I would love that.

21:33.560 --> 21:34.459
Oh, my God, I haven't
done that in like forever.

21:34.493 --> 21:35.995
So, yeah, years.

21:36.029 --> 21:38.964
Yeah, I was like
modeling for a car or something,

21:38.997 --> 21:40.531
and like that was really cool.

21:40.566 --> 21:42.500
And that's when I was
like, you know what?

21:42.534 --> 21:46.137
Oh, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo,
check it out, check it out.

21:46.170 --> 21:48.572
I bet you I could climb that.

21:50.106 --> 21:51.641
Yeah, right.

21:51.675 --> 21:53.143
You can't climb that.

21:53.176 --> 21:55.343
I could do it a
blindfold on it's so easy.

21:55.376 --> 21:57.279
Dude, those
steroids have gone to your head.

21:57.313 --> 21:58.847
You cannot climb that.

21:58.880 --> 21:59.948
All right, well,
if you're the expert.

21:59.981 --> 22:01.549
Let's see you do it.

22:01.583 --> 22:04.718
Yeah,
no, I'm gonna pass.

22:04.751 --> 22:06.419
Look, we'll make
a contest out of it.

22:06.452 --> 22:08.454
Whoever gets to the top wins.

22:08.487 --> 22:09.689
Wins what?

22:09.722 --> 22:10.656
I'll think
about that while

22:10.690 --> 22:11.624
I'm waiting for you to catch up.

22:11.657 --> 22:12.859
You guys are crazy as hell.

22:12.892 --> 22:13.960
It's gonna be dark soon.

22:13.993 --> 22:15.227
You won't be able to see shit.

22:15.260 --> 22:18.129
Yeah, but you're
a pussy and I'm not.

22:18.163 --> 22:20.698
- You sure about that?
- Burn!

22:25.002 --> 22:25.902
Yeah, I'm sure, all right.

22:25.935 --> 22:27.871
I like pussy, but I'm not one.

22:27.904 --> 22:29.906
That's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.

22:29.939 --> 22:31.372
So, what happens if
a girl beats you?

22:31.405 --> 22:33.141
That can't happen.

22:33.175 --> 22:34.442
Okay, look, it's getting
kind of dark right now,

22:34.475 --> 22:37.078
but first thing in the
morning if we have time,

22:37.111 --> 22:38.179
I'm gonna kick your ass.

22:38.212 --> 22:39.680
Who's the pussy now?

22:39.714 --> 22:44.383
So, whoever wins gets a
kiss from me and I'll post it.

22:45.517 --> 22:47.620
That works for me.

22:47.653 --> 22:48.687
I really think
you guys should wait

22:48.721 --> 22:50.189
for Lauren to get back.

22:50.222 --> 22:52.724
Why, we don't need her.

22:52.757 --> 22:54.391
We're gonna be right
back, all right?

22:54.424 --> 22:56.861
Play your game, shut up.

22:56.895 --> 22:57.794
What do you say?

22:57.828 --> 22:59.897
Are you in or are you out?

23:03.165 --> 23:04.967
I guess we can go down
there and check it out.

23:05.001 --> 23:08.670
Y'all wanna smoke
some weed before you go?

23:09.671 --> 23:10.639
Just sayin'.

23:12.374 --> 23:13.341
You ready to lose?

23:13.375 --> 23:14.675
Lead the way.

23:14.708 --> 23:16.243
I'll be right back.

23:18.845 --> 23:20.680
This should go well.

23:21.748 --> 23:23.182
They
legalized it in Vegas.

23:23.216 --> 23:25.017
That's my next stop.

23:25.050 --> 23:26.285
Hey, where's Lauren at?

23:26.318 --> 23:28.186
I thought she was
bringing beers?

23:28.220 --> 23:30.554
She went that way.

23:30.588 --> 23:31.822
Some guide.

23:31.856 --> 23:32.790
She's supposed to be
taking care of us.

24:37.509 --> 24:39.711
Hey, everyone doin' okay?

24:39.744 --> 24:42.647
I will be once
I smoke this bowl.

24:45.082 --> 24:47.417
Where's Jennifer and Ryan?

24:48.986 --> 24:49.819
Um...

24:53.289 --> 24:56.458
Uh, um, they went
to climb that cliff.

24:58.693 --> 24:59.928
What?

24:59.960 --> 25:01.428
When did they leave?

25:01.462 --> 25:03.230
Maybe five minutes.

25:07.066 --> 25:09.569
Shit, I left it at the raft.

25:12.704 --> 25:13.538
Hey, Dave?

25:15.574 --> 25:18.709
Listen, I need you to go
back and get my red bag.

25:18.743 --> 25:20.177
What you mean me, why me?

25:20.211 --> 25:21.845
Why can't you go?

25:21.878 --> 25:26.882
Because I need to go
find them and.

25:29.184 --> 25:30.419
Okay, fine, I'll go.

25:30.452 --> 25:31.220
But for the record you
should just wait here

25:31.253 --> 25:32.687
for them to come back.

25:32.720 --> 25:34.422
Thank you for your input.

25:34.455 --> 25:35.857
Yeah, whatever.

25:37.324 --> 25:39.192
Hey, you guys stay
at the campsite.

25:39.226 --> 25:40.460
Don't move.

25:40.495 --> 25:42.095
You hear what I said?

25:42.129 --> 25:43.462
Yeah, don't move.

26:02.845 --> 26:04.312
Where are we?

26:04.346 --> 26:06.181
I think we just need to
go a little bit further.

26:06.214 --> 26:07.416
I'm not sure about that.

26:07.449 --> 26:09.650
I think maybe we
should head back.

26:09.683 --> 26:10.618
Giving up so soon?

26:10.651 --> 26:12.720
No, I'm just not stupid.

26:15.655 --> 26:17.657
What the fuck is that?

26:18.792 --> 26:20.959
It sounds like gunshots.

26:20.993 --> 26:23.328
Maybe we should get back.

26:44.345 --> 26:45.180
Is that...

26:52.952 --> 26:56.189
- Are you okay?
- Where did she come from?

27:02.593 --> 27:04.395
Wait, wait, wait,
what's going on?

27:04.428 --> 27:05.596
This can't be good.

27:05.629 --> 27:06.397
What are you scared
of a little girl?

27:06.430 --> 27:07.964
Maybe she needs help.

27:09.866 --> 27:10.834
Hey, wait.

27:10.867 --> 27:12.435
We don't know where we're going.

27:12.469 --> 27:14.303
Who's the pussy now?

27:16.506 --> 27:17.906
Shit.

27:57.572 --> 27:59.373
I hope they get back soon.

28:02.041 --> 28:03.243
Did you hear that?

28:03.276 --> 28:04.277
Hear what?

28:06.312 --> 28:08.113
I coulda sworn
I heard something

28:08.147 --> 28:11.316
that sounded like
horses or something.

28:12.850 --> 28:14.919
I didn't hear anything.

28:18.355 --> 28:20.657
Haven't you been
smoking weed with Dave?

28:20.690 --> 28:21.592
I didn't.

28:22.925 --> 28:25.462
I mean, I'm not high anymore.

28:25.495 --> 28:27.597
Hm, boo!

28:30.231 --> 28:31.332
Oh, Kyle, relax.

28:31.366 --> 28:33.267
At least the moon's comin' up,

28:33.300 --> 28:36.837
we'll have a little
bit of light.

28:36.870 --> 28:39.038
I need to take pictures
and videos of all this.

28:39.071 --> 28:40.873
Is that really all you
can think of right now,

28:40.907 --> 28:42.775
posting shit online?

28:42.808 --> 28:44.943
It's how I make
my money, okay?

28:44.976 --> 28:46.945
Do you have over
82,000 followers?

28:46.978 --> 28:49.980
Didn't think so.

28:50.014 --> 28:52.683
You didn't have to be so mean.

29:07.496 --> 29:09.997
Wait, I just heard something.

29:10.031 --> 29:11.499
I didn't hear anything.

29:11.532 --> 29:12.365
Listen.

29:28.345 --> 29:29.246
Did you hear that?

29:29.279 --> 29:31.781
I told you I heard something.

29:33.849 --> 29:34.984
You should go check it out.

29:35.017 --> 29:35.918
Me? Why me?

29:35.952 --> 29:36.719
I'm not going down there.

29:36.752 --> 29:38.820
Well, neither am I.

29:38.853 --> 29:40.489
Didn't you say you had
to go the bathroom?

29:40.523 --> 29:42.923
Just go down there and do it.

29:47.495 --> 29:49.530
Okay, but I'm
not going too far.

29:49.563 --> 29:51.731
It's scary as shit down there.

29:51.764 --> 29:52.600
Okay.

30:09.979 --> 30:10.913
Uh, uh, uh.

30:29.529 --> 30:30.630
Back so soon?

30:37.034 --> 30:38.168
Kyle, quit playing games.

30:38.202 --> 30:39.638
This isn't funny.

30:49.479 --> 30:50.613
Kyle.

30:54.915 --> 30:57.784
Kyle.

30:59.286 --> 31:00.554
Who are you?

31:14.197 --> 31:15.399
No, please, no!

31:24.005 --> 31:25.775
Did you hear that?

31:37.618 --> 31:39.918
I didn't hear anything.

31:39.951 --> 31:42.087
I thought heard like a voice.

31:42.120 --> 31:43.656
A scream or something.

31:43.690 --> 31:45.189
Are you losing it?

31:45.222 --> 31:46.924
No, not yet at least.

31:46.957 --> 31:49.795
I did hear something though.

31:49.827 --> 31:51.227
Maybe someone fell.

31:51.261 --> 31:52.797
Let's just
go back to camp.

31:52.829 --> 31:54.632
You just wanna bang
that selfie princess.

31:54.665 --> 31:56.231
So, you do too.

31:56.265 --> 31:59.201
Yeah, but right now
I wanna find that girl.

32:10.010 --> 32:11.877
Wait, do you need help?

32:15.047 --> 32:17.849
Jesus, this is
some stupid shit.

32:19.785 --> 32:21.186
Jennifer?

32:21.219 --> 32:22.520
Ryan?

32:22.554 --> 32:24.922
Can you guys hear me?

32:24.955 --> 32:26.558
Fuck.

32:26.591 --> 32:27.425
Jennifer!

32:28.858 --> 32:29.693
Ryan!

32:31.194 --> 32:32.128
Goddamn it.

32:39.233 --> 32:42.437
I can't believe that shit.

32:42.471 --> 32:43.870
Oh, go send the black
dude to go fetch the shit.

32:52.512 --> 32:54.513
I gotta get the fuck outta here.

32:55.814 --> 32:57.949
I didn't see or hear anything.

32:57.982 --> 32:59.584
They come back yet?

33:01.619 --> 33:03.353
Sarah, you go to bed?

33:06.556 --> 33:07.390
Sarah?

33:08.458 --> 33:10.092
Sarah, are you okay?

33:11.059 --> 33:11.861
Sarah?

33:16.230 --> 33:18.165
Jesus Christ, what
happened Sarah?

33:26.439 --> 33:27.540
Who did this?

33:28.808 --> 33:29.642
I did.

33:31.976 --> 33:34.245
Stay away from me.

33:56.397 --> 33:58.364
Jesus fuckin' Christ, dude.

33:58.398 --> 33:59.699
- What the fuck?
- She's dead!

33:59.733 --> 34:00.901
He killed her!

34:02.502 --> 34:04.670
Oh, fuck that hurts!

34:04.703 --> 34:05.805
He killed her!

34:05.838 --> 34:07.138
What are you talking about?

34:07.172 --> 34:08.106
She's dead.

34:08.139 --> 34:09.373
The guy appeared outta no where.

34:09.407 --> 34:10.475
Who's dead?

34:10.507 --> 34:12.309
- What guy?
- Sarah at the fire.

34:12.342 --> 34:13.511
The hottie?

34:13.545 --> 34:14.710
What happened?

34:14.745 --> 34:15.945
I dunno.

34:15.978 --> 34:17.681
I heard some sounds
and then I went

34:17.714 --> 34:20.716
to take a piss and
when I came back...

34:20.750 --> 34:21.983
And?

34:22.016 --> 34:24.319
What the fuck are
you talking about?

34:24.351 --> 34:27.221
She was lying there dead.

34:27.254 --> 34:29.089
Blood everywhere.

34:29.123 --> 34:30.424
Then he was behind me.

34:30.458 --> 34:31.592
Who was behind you, Ryan?

34:31.625 --> 34:33.059
No, not Ryan.

34:33.092 --> 34:34.293
It was this crazy looking
weird guy who appeared

34:34.327 --> 34:36.228
outta nowhere and
just said he did it.

34:38.498 --> 34:40.098
You still high?

34:40.132 --> 34:42.701
- What else did he say?
- Nothing.

34:42.734 --> 34:47.370
I mean, I just, like I just ran
outta there as fast I could.

34:47.405 --> 34:48.304
Well, let's go
back to the campfire

34:48.338 --> 34:49.139
and see what's going on.

34:49.172 --> 34:50.306
No.

34:50.340 --> 34:51.341
Not me.

34:51.373 --> 34:53.208
I'm not going back up there.

34:53.242 --> 34:55.344
Well, what the fuck you
gonna do then, stay here?

34:55.377 --> 34:56.212
I dunno.

34:57.680 --> 35:00.048
I'm not going back up there.

35:00.081 --> 35:03.485
I'm going back to the fire.

35:03.518 --> 35:06.387
It's gonna take me a while.

35:09.121 --> 35:09.957
Sorry.

35:24.033 --> 35:24.869
Sarah?

35:30.473 --> 35:33.977
Oh, shit!

35:39.080 --> 35:39.914
Oh, fuck.

35:40.948 --> 35:41.849
Oh, fuck.

35:41.883 --> 35:43.851
What the fuck's going on?

35:46.051 --> 35:48.354
Hey, where are you?

35:48.388 --> 35:49.288
Up here.

35:49.321 --> 35:52.458
You find that girl or what?

35:52.491 --> 35:53.526
Yes.

35:53.559 --> 35:55.827
Well, does she need help?

36:03.000 --> 36:05.034
Who the fuck is that?

36:05.067 --> 36:07.403
I dunno, but I
think we should leave.

36:07.436 --> 36:08.437
Good idea.

37:01.914 --> 37:03.315
Hey, it's you.

37:03.348 --> 37:04.550
Glad you could make it.

37:04.583 --> 37:07.284
What the fuck
happened to Sarah?

37:10.020 --> 37:11.889
Oh, shit, he was right.

37:11.922 --> 37:14.058
- Who was right?
- Kyle.

37:14.090 --> 37:15.725
Kyle, I ran into him
or he ran into me

37:15.758 --> 37:16.960
on my way back from the raft.

37:16.993 --> 37:17.894
What'd he say?

37:17.927 --> 37:19.127
Nothing that made sense.

37:19.161 --> 37:20.063
Just that he killed or
some shit like that.

37:20.095 --> 37:21.763
What the fuck is going on?

37:21.797 --> 37:23.130
How do I know
you didn't do this?

37:23.164 --> 37:24.131
Me?

37:24.165 --> 37:25.634
Hell nah, I went
to go grab this.

37:25.667 --> 37:27.835
When I left she was alive.

37:27.868 --> 37:29.470
This is so bad,
this is really bad.

37:29.503 --> 37:31.605
Yeah, no shit.

37:31.638 --> 37:32.505
All right, so he
saw what happened?

37:32.539 --> 37:33.740
What did he say?

37:33.773 --> 37:34.941
No, he didn't
see what happened.

37:34.975 --> 37:35.875
He just said he
went to the bathroom

37:35.909 --> 37:37.009
and he came back she was gone.

37:37.042 --> 37:38.043
That's it?

37:39.177 --> 37:41.580
No, no, he said he
also saw this crazy guy

37:41.614 --> 37:43.180
who said he did it.

38:02.597 --> 38:05.532
- Crazy guy?
- Yeah, that's what he said.

38:05.566 --> 38:09.636
Gimme my bag.

38:09.669 --> 38:13.072
Oh, hell yeah.

38:13.106 --> 38:14.039
Oh, fuck.

38:34.188 --> 38:35.024
Fuck!

38:35.057 --> 38:36.457
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

38:38.225 --> 38:39.827
No answer, he's
supposed to be on call.

38:39.861 --> 38:41.094
- Who?
- Rob.

38:41.128 --> 38:42.529
I'll call back in a bit.

38:42.562 --> 38:43.563
Rob?

38:43.597 --> 38:44.598
Who the fuck is Rob?

38:44.631 --> 38:45.831
Call the damn police.

38:45.865 --> 38:47.500
Call 911, she's dead
for Christ's sake.

38:47.533 --> 38:49.935
It would take hours for anyone
to get out here right now.

38:49.969 --> 38:51.369
Where's Kyle?

38:51.403 --> 38:52.604
- I need everyone together.
- Down by the raft.

38:52.637 --> 38:53.538
I don't know where
he was going though.

38:53.571 --> 38:54.406
I told him to come back here.

38:54.439 --> 38:55.540
Okay, listen.

38:55.573 --> 38:56.907
I'm gonna go get him.

38:56.940 --> 39:00.276
Grab a t-shirt, wrap
it around your leg.

39:00.309 --> 39:01.277
Try not to freak out.

39:01.310 --> 39:03.245
Yeah, too late for that.

39:12.020 --> 39:14.922
Oh, God.

39:14.955 --> 39:16.691
These are our footprints.

39:16.724 --> 39:18.591
We've been here before.

39:20.060 --> 39:22.829
This whole place is
like a fuckin' maze.

39:22.862 --> 39:25.364
I have no idea where
the fuck we are!

39:25.397 --> 39:28.499
I think the
campsite's that way?

39:28.533 --> 39:29.967
It can't be that far.

39:30.001 --> 39:32.437
Yeah, I think if we just
head in that direction

39:32.470 --> 39:34.905
we'll get back to the campsite.

39:34.938 --> 39:37.174
What if we never get out?

39:38.608 --> 39:40.810
I just wanna get away from,

39:40.843 --> 39:43.379
from whatever the
fuck it was we saw.

39:43.412 --> 39:46.246
Yeah, for once
I agree with you.

40:07.598 --> 40:09.467
Hey, are you okay?

40:09.500 --> 40:10.601
Yeah, I'm fine.

40:10.634 --> 40:11.901
What happened up there?

40:11.935 --> 40:13.136
- I didn't see what happened.
- Yes, you did.

40:13.169 --> 40:15.270
I, I didn't see what happened.

40:15.304 --> 40:17.606
We heard some noises and I went

40:17.639 --> 40:20.409
to go check it out and I pissed.

40:20.442 --> 40:22.944
When I came back she was dead.

40:23.945 --> 40:24.846
You're fucking lying to me.

40:24.879 --> 40:26.981
I am not lying to you.

40:27.014 --> 40:28.582
Why is there blood all
over your fuckin' hands?

40:28.615 --> 40:31.785
'Cause I, I was
checking out Sarah.

40:31.818 --> 40:33.318
She's dead!

40:33.352 --> 40:34.820
Are you kidding me?

40:34.854 --> 40:36.889
She was bleeding, of course
I'm gonna have it on my hands.

40:36.922 --> 40:38.990
I swear to God I
didn't kill her.

40:39.023 --> 40:40.692
There was this creepy
guy who said he did it.

40:42.460 --> 40:44.027
Can you look at me?

40:45.362 --> 40:47.631
I'm not capable of
doing something-

40:56.738 --> 40:58.340
Sarah's dead, Lauren.

40:58.373 --> 40:59.573
- Come on.
- Let's get back to

40:59.607 --> 41:00.541
the campsite and get the others.

41:00.574 --> 41:01.375
I'm not going back out there.

41:01.408 --> 41:02.910
I'm staying right here.

41:02.943 --> 41:04.477
We need to stay together if
we're gonna get outta here.

41:04.511 --> 41:05.445
He's out there.

41:05.478 --> 41:06.412
I'll just stay with the raft.

41:06.446 --> 41:08.815
You gotta come back here.

41:08.848 --> 41:10.281
Fine, stay here.

41:10.315 --> 41:12.184
And don't fuckin' move!

41:14.319 --> 41:15.119
I won't.

41:36.204 --> 41:39.506
What the fuck was that?

41:39.540 --> 41:41.175
I dunno, maybe a bird?

41:41.208 --> 41:42.809
A bird at night?

41:42.842 --> 41:43.910
Didn't sound like an owl.

41:46.646 --> 41:48.880
What the fuck is going on?

41:48.914 --> 41:50.348
I'm starting to not like this.

41:50.382 --> 41:51.316
Just now?

41:52.950 --> 41:54.752
This place is crazy.

41:54.785 --> 41:56.220
It's like we've been dosed.

41:56.253 --> 41:59.088
Seeing and hearing
fucked up shit.

42:06.562 --> 42:07.429
I gotta get the
fuck outta here.

42:12.233 --> 42:14.100
I gotta get the fuck outta here.

42:14.134 --> 42:17.305
I gotta get the fuck outta here.

42:17.337 --> 42:20.539
Hey, it's just me.

42:20.573 --> 42:22.575
- Did you find him?
- Yeah.

42:22.608 --> 42:23.742
He tell you what happened?

42:23.776 --> 42:24.676
Uh huh.

42:24.709 --> 42:26.110
He didn't come with you?

42:26.144 --> 42:28.079
No, he's gonna
stay at the raft.

42:28.112 --> 42:29.613
I think we should get the
other two and get outta here.

42:29.646 --> 42:30.647
Well, maybe he did it?

42:30.681 --> 42:31.882
It was just the two of them.

42:31.915 --> 42:33.417
I don't think
he did this, okay?

42:33.450 --> 42:35.117
- And he said he didn't do it.
- Oh, well, as long as he said

42:35.151 --> 42:36.686
he didn't do it.

42:36.719 --> 42:40.622
You said you didn't do
it and I believed you.

42:40.655 --> 42:42.824
Yeah, he did look a little
scared when I saw him.

42:42.858 --> 42:44.893
Okay, maybe he's
telling the truth.

42:44.926 --> 42:46.660
Look, listen,

42:46.694 --> 42:48.896
I heard a lotta crazy
shit when you were gone.

42:48.929 --> 42:50.364
Crazy shit, like what shit?

42:50.397 --> 42:53.399
Like horses running
and gunshots and shit,

42:53.433 --> 42:55.101
and weird ass yells.

42:57.035 --> 42:58.370
You've been smoking weed.

42:58.403 --> 43:00.172
Look I'm serious, okay?

43:00.205 --> 43:01.106
What do you think happened?

43:01.139 --> 43:02.206
Sarah tripped and fell on an ax?

43:02.240 --> 43:03.507
There's something going on here.

43:03.541 --> 43:05.042
I don't know what
happened, okay?

43:05.076 --> 43:06.043
I didn't see it!

43:06.077 --> 43:09.679
I don't know!

43:13.816 --> 43:14.617
Oh, shit.

43:15.718 --> 43:17.286
You okay?

43:32.865 --> 43:35.133
Yeah, I'm okay, I'm okay.

43:36.067 --> 43:37.235
Define okay.

43:39.270 --> 43:40.571
We shouldn't stay here.

43:40.604 --> 43:41.805
What, no.

43:41.839 --> 43:43.040
We have a fire, I
can find more wood,

43:43.073 --> 43:46.009
and I can't move
that far with my leg.

43:46.042 --> 43:47.644
I'm gonna go try to find them.

43:47.677 --> 43:48.912
You should come with me.

43:48.945 --> 43:49.578
With that
killer out there?

43:49.611 --> 43:51.046
Are you crazy?

43:51.079 --> 43:54.483
I'd rather be a moving
target than a sitting duck.

43:57.585 --> 43:59.321
- Fuck!
- Come on.

44:50.962 --> 44:53.230
We never should
have tried to go this way.

44:53.264 --> 44:54.731
You wanted
to go this way.

44:54.764 --> 44:56.733
It can't be this hard
to walk like half a mile.

44:56.766 --> 44:58.501
Apparently it is.

44:58.535 --> 45:00.869
I'm gonna climb up
and see where we are.

45:00.903 --> 45:02.738
I can climb up if you want.

45:02.771 --> 45:05.341
Look, I know you're
like a manly man,

45:05.374 --> 45:06.541
but just because
you are doesn't mean

45:06.574 --> 45:07.675
you can do this
shit better than me.

45:07.709 --> 45:09.278
We can make this the bet.

45:09.311 --> 45:10.210
Now?

45:10.243 --> 45:11.878
You wanna do the stupid bet now?

45:11.912 --> 45:13.613
Let's just get the
hell outta here.

45:13.647 --> 45:15.948
I usually have
an easier time with women.

45:15.982 --> 45:18.117
I am sure you do, but I'm
not interested in your dick,

45:18.150 --> 45:19.319
so get over it.

45:20.353 --> 45:22.020
I'm gonna get as high as I can

45:22.053 --> 45:25.457
and see what we can
see in the moonlight.

46:03.086 --> 46:07.090
Shit!

46:09.558 --> 46:12.295
I don't
think I can go any higher.

46:12.329 --> 46:15.096
And I can't see shit up here.

46:15.130 --> 46:16.664
What'd you say?

46:16.698 --> 46:18.799
I said I can't see shit!

46:20.067 --> 46:23.438
There's like a faint
glow over there.

46:23.471 --> 46:25.238
Over where?

46:25.272 --> 46:26.172
It doesn't matter.

46:26.205 --> 46:28.574
We can't get to it from here.

46:28.608 --> 46:31.777
We're gonna have to
find another way.

46:31.810 --> 46:36.415
I'm coming down.

47:28.390 --> 47:29.824
I'm freaking out.

47:29.857 --> 47:31.326
We're fucking lost.

47:31.359 --> 47:33.094
Well, we could sit here and
wait for the sun to come up

47:33.127 --> 47:35.662
and then find our way out after.

47:35.695 --> 47:38.399
Or we could go back over
there and stay in the cave.

47:38.432 --> 47:39.798
No thanks.

47:39.832 --> 47:42.302
I wanna get back to the fire.

47:42.335 --> 47:44.202
We could keep each other warm.

47:44.235 --> 47:47.272
Dude, how many times do I
have to tell you to fuck off?!

47:47.306 --> 47:49.173
Okay, okay, calm down.

47:49.207 --> 47:50.740
Calm down?

47:50.774 --> 47:52.809
You want me to calm down?

47:52.843 --> 47:55.678
I am in the middle of fucking
nowhere in a fucking desert,

47:55.711 --> 47:57.414
in some kind of
godforsaken maze with some

47:57.447 --> 47:59.449
douchebag who won't stop
fucking hitting on me,

47:59.483 --> 48:01.850
and you want me to calm down?!

48:01.883 --> 48:03.785
Just sayin'.

48:03.818 --> 48:05.253
Never tell women to calm down!

48:05.286 --> 48:06.954
Don't you know that?

48:08.655 --> 48:09.923
Maybe we should
just start yelling.

48:09.957 --> 48:11.891
Yeah, 'cause
that's gonna work.

48:11.924 --> 48:12.758
Hey!

48:14.026 --> 48:16.161
Where are you guys?

48:16.194 --> 48:17.896
Can you hear me?

48:19.898 --> 48:20.966
Keep it up.

48:20.999 --> 48:22.967
I think it's working!

48:23.000 --> 48:23.801
Thanks, asshole.

48:23.834 --> 48:25.303
I think I will.

48:25.337 --> 48:26.170
Hello!

48:38.045 --> 48:39.914
Are you finished?

48:39.947 --> 48:42.749
I'm gonna yell and scream
as much as I want to, okay?

48:42.782 --> 48:43.984
I don't think it's helping.

48:44.017 --> 48:46.119
You know what's
not helping is you.

48:46.153 --> 48:49.523
Whatever, I coulda
left you out here alone.

48:49.556 --> 48:51.157
Wow, such a gentleman.

48:51.190 --> 48:53.658
And newsflash, I don't need you.

48:53.691 --> 48:55.226
Hello?

48:55.261 --> 48:57.596
I'm trapped with an asshole.

48:59.230 --> 49:00.130
Hilarious.

49:00.164 --> 49:02.400
Thanks for yelling that one.

49:04.635 --> 49:07.036
Hello,
can you hear me?

49:07.069 --> 49:09.105
Yes, yes, we can hear you!

49:09.138 --> 49:11.407
- Not helping, huh?
- Whatever.

49:11.440 --> 49:13.909
- Is it them?
- Yeah, it's them.

49:13.942 --> 49:15.443
Where are you?

49:15.477 --> 49:18.513
Down here, we're down here.

49:18.547 --> 49:19.846
Can
you guys climb up?

49:19.879 --> 49:20.947
No, we can't.

49:20.980 --> 49:22.715
It's too steep.

49:22.749 --> 49:24.884
They can't climb out,
so I'm gonna go down.

49:24.918 --> 49:26.653
Down there, how'd
they get down there?

49:26.685 --> 49:27.719
I have no idea.

49:27.753 --> 49:30.788
It's easy to get lost out here.

49:30.821 --> 49:33.024
I'll find a way to
come down to you.

49:33.057 --> 49:35.227
Yes, finally some help.

49:35.260 --> 49:36.294
We'll see.

49:36.327 --> 49:38.728
How is she gonna get down here?

49:38.762 --> 49:40.197
Hopefully
not by gravity.

49:48.870 --> 49:52.005
Yeah, good luck with that.

49:52.039 --> 49:54.875
- How's your leg?
- Feels like shit.

49:54.908 --> 49:56.076
All right.

49:56.109 --> 49:57.977
You should stay here.

49:58.010 --> 49:59.680
Alone in the dark?

50:00.846 --> 50:03.316
I can't risk you
getting hurt anymore.

50:03.349 --> 50:04.849
I'll be back soon.

50:12.257 --> 50:13.823
She's coming down.

50:13.856 --> 50:15.792
I'm gonna stay up here.

50:19.728 --> 50:21.730
- I told you.
- Whatever.

50:27.436 --> 50:29.470
How long?

50:29.503 --> 50:30.404
Not sure.

50:30.438 --> 50:32.440
She has to find a way down.

50:32.473 --> 50:33.807
Could be a while.

50:33.840 --> 50:36.175
Yeah, but at least
we're making progress.

50:36.209 --> 50:38.877
Hey, is Sarah with you?

50:41.179 --> 50:42.514
Who?

50:42.548 --> 50:45.882
You know, Sarah, the
hot girl from Phoenix.

50:45.916 --> 50:47.218
Always thinking
with your dick, huh?

50:47.252 --> 50:49.186
Whatever, at least
she likes dick.

50:49.220 --> 50:50.554
Is she with you?

50:51.622 --> 50:53.122
Oh, Sarah, yeah.

50:54.258 --> 50:56.726
Uh, well, the
short answer is no.

50:58.893 --> 51:00.929
What's the long answer?

51:02.397 --> 51:06.833
Um, you know, I'm gonna let
Lauren break it down to you.

51:07.735 --> 51:09.168
What the fuck does that mean?

51:09.203 --> 51:10.704
Maybe she's not
interested in you.

51:10.738 --> 51:12.372
Yeah right.

51:13.706 --> 51:15.208
Oh, you handle
rejection really well.

51:15.241 --> 51:16.476
Whatever.

51:16.509 --> 51:19.678
- Where are you going?
- To take a piss.

52:17.358 --> 52:19.993
Glad you could make
it, but do you mind?

52:20.026 --> 52:22.362
Unless you want some action.

52:28.833 --> 52:29.601
Okay, let's get-

52:34.037 --> 52:35.807
Who the fuck are you?

52:42.144 --> 52:43.713
I'm warning you bro, I
fight in the Octagon.

52:43.746 --> 52:45.348
I'll kick your ass.

52:48.982 --> 52:50.918
Fuckin' talk goddammit.

52:57.491 --> 52:58.324
Fuck!

53:09.734 --> 53:11.901
Dude, took you long enough.

53:11.935 --> 53:13.204
We gotta go.

53:13.237 --> 53:14.170
- We gotta get outta here.
- Why, what's going on?

53:14.205 --> 53:15.137
We gotta go into the cave.

53:15.170 --> 53:16.339
We're waiting for Lauren.

53:16.373 --> 53:17.307
No, no, no, there's
no time for it.

53:17.340 --> 53:18.575
We gotta get outta here now.

53:18.608 --> 53:20.309
I told you I'm not
going in that cave.

53:20.342 --> 53:22.311
What is going on?

53:22.344 --> 53:23.178
Seriously?

53:25.346 --> 53:29.584
Seriously, why?

53:31.818 --> 53:33.152
Who the hell is that?

53:33.186 --> 53:34.821
I dunno, but he
swung his ax at me.

53:34.855 --> 53:36.856
What are you talking about?

53:36.888 --> 53:38.858
Hey, look, man, we're just,
we're just kinda lost.

53:38.890 --> 53:42.059
Can you tell us how
to get outta here?

53:57.104 --> 54:01.543
We gotta go, we gotta,
we gotta go, we gotta go!

54:23.560 --> 54:25.228
I can't see shit!

54:25.262 --> 54:26.530
Come on,
just keep moving.

54:29.532 --> 54:33.402
Fuck, I
need some goddamn light!

54:47.680 --> 54:51.081
Shit.

55:13.534 --> 55:14.802
Stay behind me.

55:37.721 --> 55:38.855
Run!

55:38.888 --> 55:40.356
I said, run, now!

55:47.027 --> 55:48.796
Come on, bring it.

56:31.130 --> 56:32.498
Let's get the fuck outta here.

56:44.441 --> 56:46.210
Ryan, what's wrong?

56:46.243 --> 56:48.211
Run, save yourself.

58:28.859 --> 58:30.227
Dave,
can you hear me?

58:30.260 --> 58:32.029
Yeah, I can hear you.

58:32.062 --> 58:33.664
It looks like
they went in this cave.

58:33.697 --> 58:35.198
I'm going in.

58:35.231 --> 58:36.799
Stay where you are.

59:12.962 --> 59:15.698
Somebody help me!

59:18.633 --> 59:20.136
Help!

01:00:20.917 --> 01:00:21.751
Help!

01:00:23.153 --> 01:00:24.587
Somebody help me!

01:01:19.931 --> 01:01:20.866
Oh, shit.

01:01:22.768 --> 01:01:23.602
I'm sorry.

01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:27.438
Are you okay?

01:01:27.471 --> 01:01:28.606
Come on.

01:01:28.639 --> 01:01:29.473
Wake up.

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:32.008
Shit.

01:01:40.815 --> 01:01:42.049
Wake up, come on.

01:01:42.083 --> 01:01:43.618
Wake up!

01:01:43.651 --> 01:01:44.952
Please, please, wake up.

01:01:44.986 --> 01:01:45.952
Please wake up.

01:01:45.986 --> 01:01:46.853
Please!

01:02:06.837 --> 01:02:08.304
Stay away from me!

01:03:17.094 --> 01:03:18.528
Oh, what the fuck?

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:21.131
Hey!

01:03:21.997 --> 01:03:23.132
Are you still here?

01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:24.300
Hey, yeah, I'm here.

01:03:24.334 --> 01:03:25.134
What's going on?

01:03:25.168 --> 01:03:26.368
Everyone okay?

01:03:26.401 --> 01:03:27.735
You have to get
me out of here.

01:03:27.768 --> 01:03:30.771
You have to help me.

01:03:30.805 --> 01:03:31.706
Jennifer?

01:03:33.074 --> 01:03:33.907
You okay?

01:03:35.076 --> 01:03:37.311
I, I, I, I, I can't
really climb that well.

01:03:37.345 --> 01:03:38.311
I hurt my leg.

01:03:38.345 --> 01:03:39.445
Please you have to!

01:03:39.478 --> 01:03:40.313
He's coming!

01:03:40.347 --> 01:03:41.314
Everyone's dead.

01:03:41.348 --> 01:03:42.615
You have to help me!

01:03:42.648 --> 01:03:43.681
Everyone's dead?

01:03:43.715 --> 01:03:44.916
Yes and he's coming!

01:03:44.949 --> 01:03:46.618
You have to help me!

01:03:47.552 --> 01:03:49.320
I'll come find you.

01:03:50.921 --> 01:03:53.689
I, I, I don't have
a rope or anything.

01:03:53.723 --> 01:03:54.891
Shit.

01:03:54.924 --> 01:03:56.525
You gotta climb out.

01:03:56.559 --> 01:03:58.027
Come on, you can do it.

01:03:58.061 --> 01:03:58.960
I can't!

01:03:58.994 --> 01:04:00.162
You have to, come on.

01:04:00.196 --> 01:04:01.163
You can make it.

01:04:01.197 --> 01:04:03.632
You're a badass rock climber.

01:04:17.943 --> 01:04:19.312
Come on, Jen, you can do it.

01:04:19.345 --> 01:04:21.746
You can do this,
you can do this.

01:04:38.793 --> 01:04:40.595
Are you climbing?

01:04:40.628 --> 01:04:42.629
I'm trying!

01:04:42.663 --> 01:04:45.066
Come on,
you can make it.

01:04:45.099 --> 01:04:46.134
Just come on,
you're almost there.

01:04:49.236 --> 01:04:50.304
Grab my hand.

01:04:51.904 --> 01:04:53.738
I can't, it's too far!

01:04:53.772 --> 01:04:55.607
Yes you
can, you've got this!

01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:57.509
Just grab my hand.

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:04.647
No!

01:05:05.515 --> 01:05:07.084
Jennifer!

01:07:08.782 --> 01:07:09.616
No, no.

01:07:30.434 --> 01:07:31.535
I'm so sorry.

01:07:38.906 --> 01:07:40.308
Hello?

01:07:40.341 --> 01:07:42.177
Is someone down there?!

01:07:42.210 --> 01:07:44.478
Dave, you still up there?

01:07:45.312 --> 01:07:46.746
Yes, I'm up here!

01:07:46.779 --> 01:07:48.181
You're alive?!

01:07:48.214 --> 01:07:49.449
So far.

01:07:49.482 --> 01:07:51.484
How do we get outta here?

01:07:51.517 --> 01:07:52.818
I can't climb up
from where I'm at!

01:07:52.851 --> 01:07:54.985
You're gonna
have to come down!

01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:56.987
It's a little ways
down on the right!

01:07:57.022 --> 01:07:59.457
I'm not sure I can
do that with my leg!

01:07:59.490 --> 01:08:00.590
We have to stay
together if we're

01:08:00.623 --> 01:08:03.127
gonna get the fuck outta here!

01:08:04.461 --> 01:08:06.429
So, you want me to
basically fall down a cliff?

01:08:06.463 --> 01:08:08.264
You can slide down!

01:08:08.298 --> 01:08:10.332
- I did!
- I can't do that.

01:08:10.365 --> 01:08:11.833
Listen, we need
to get outta here.

01:08:11.866 --> 01:08:13.734
I'm not leaving without you!

01:08:13.768 --> 01:08:15.403
- Shit!
- All right, so get down here!

01:08:15.436 --> 01:08:18.038
Get your fucking ass
down here, pronto!

01:08:18.072 --> 01:08:19.207
All right, all right, fine.

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:20.474
Where do I go?

01:08:20.506 --> 01:08:22.707
It's a couple hundred
yards down on the right.

01:08:22.741 --> 01:08:27.580
I'm gonna go grab the sat
phone and I'll meet you there.

01:08:48.395 --> 01:08:52.265
- You're almost there.
- This fucking sucks.

01:08:52.299 --> 01:08:55.702
Oh!

01:08:55.734 --> 01:08:59.538
Oh, shit.

01:08:59.572 --> 01:09:01.740
Easier coming down
than going up.

01:09:01.773 --> 01:09:02.773
Yeah, I guess.

01:09:02.807 --> 01:09:06.444
Thanks.

01:09:06.478 --> 01:09:08.078
What the hell happened to you?

01:09:08.112 --> 01:09:10.281
A rock I think.

01:09:12.749 --> 01:09:15.152
So, uh, everyone else is...

01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:19.321
Mm hm, yeah, I think so.

01:09:21.956 --> 01:09:24.559
Kyle's still at the raft.

01:09:24.591 --> 01:09:26.627
This is fuckin' crazy.

01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:27.995
What's going on?

01:09:30.397 --> 01:09:32.064
I don't know.

01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:34.832
But I think we should
head to the raft.

01:09:34.866 --> 01:09:36.234
Have you tried
calling someone again?

01:09:36.269 --> 01:09:38.004
Oh, shit, I forgot.

01:09:39.071 --> 01:09:41.206
And I'm the stoner.

01:09:41.238 --> 01:09:43.140
- Dammit!
- What now?

01:09:43.175 --> 01:09:45.442
- Oh, it's not charged.
- What?

01:09:45.475 --> 01:09:47.777
What the fuck is
wrong with you people?

01:09:47.810 --> 01:09:50.514
Rob was supposed to
charge it before I left,

01:09:50.548 --> 01:09:52.747
but I don't know what happened.

01:09:52.781 --> 01:09:55.118
Okay, fuck.

01:09:58.187 --> 01:10:00.888
Chief, Chief, you there?

01:10:00.922 --> 01:10:03.757
Lauren, yes, I can hear you.

01:10:03.790 --> 01:10:07.427
Chief you need to come get
us with the boat right now.

01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:11.498
I know, I
know what's going on.

01:10:11.531 --> 01:10:13.065
You know?

01:10:13.098 --> 01:10:15.167
Yes, but I can't
help right now.

01:10:15.201 --> 01:10:16.635
Something's happened here too.

01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:18.735
What, what do you mean?

01:10:19.637 --> 01:10:20.904
Rob's dead.

01:10:24.208 --> 01:10:26.210
He, uh, he hung himself.

01:10:27.644 --> 01:10:29.679
Lauren, listen to me.

01:10:29.711 --> 01:10:30.779
Find him.

01:10:30.812 --> 01:10:32.415
You know who I'm talking about.

01:10:32.448 --> 01:10:33.281
Find him.

01:10:35.916 --> 01:10:37.552
What?

01:10:37.586 --> 01:10:39.919
Look, Chief, Chief.

01:10:39.953 --> 01:10:41.155
Chief, are you there?

01:10:41.188 --> 01:10:42.356
Chief!

01:10:42.389 --> 01:10:43.790
- Fuck!
- What the hell was that?

01:10:43.823 --> 01:10:45.124
Is he calling the police?

01:10:45.158 --> 01:10:47.193
Or better yet, the fuckin' army?

01:10:47.227 --> 01:10:48.661
No, he isn't.

01:10:48.695 --> 01:10:50.295
Call 911, now.

01:10:50.329 --> 01:10:52.030
- Enough with this horseshit.
- It's dead!

01:10:52.064 --> 01:10:53.432
Oh, of course it is.

01:10:53.465 --> 01:10:54.798
So are we, fuck!

01:10:56.766 --> 01:10:59.237
I need to find him.

01:10:59.270 --> 01:11:00.303
Who?

01:11:00.337 --> 01:11:01.471
The crazy guy?

01:11:03.506 --> 01:11:06.275
I don't know, but I'll
know when I see him.

01:11:06.308 --> 01:11:08.943
And what if he finds us first?

01:11:10.079 --> 01:11:14.048
I got this.

01:11:14.082 --> 01:11:16.849
And if that don't work?

01:11:16.882 --> 01:11:19.286
Then run as fast as you can.

01:11:28.059 --> 01:11:29.661
Is this the way out?

01:11:29.694 --> 01:11:33.763
Yeah as long as
we come out near the raft.

01:11:33.796 --> 01:11:35.633
We're gonna
fuckin' die out there.

01:11:35.666 --> 01:11:37.134
Dave, listen to me.

01:11:37.166 --> 01:11:38.668
We're not dying out here, okay?

01:11:38.701 --> 01:11:41.671
We're getting to the raft
and we're getting outta here.

01:11:47.941 --> 01:11:49.243
What the fuck is this place?

01:11:50.711 --> 01:11:54.447
Stay with me.

01:12:09.693 --> 01:12:11.894
I don't know why
this is happening.

01:12:11.927 --> 01:12:13.563
Am I missing something?

01:12:13.597 --> 01:12:17.233
Uh uh, I just keep
seeing people in my head.

01:12:17.266 --> 01:12:20.201
That
doesn't sound good.

01:12:20.235 --> 01:12:22.270
- Yeah.
- Here, let's keep moving.

01:12:22.304 --> 01:12:23.138
Okay.

01:12:45.323 --> 01:12:46.955
Fuck!

01:12:46.990 --> 01:12:49.559
I think we're getting close.

01:12:49.592 --> 01:12:51.628
What's going on?

01:12:51.661 --> 01:12:53.962
What's that, that light?

01:12:53.996 --> 01:12:56.565
This is just
like a dream I had.

01:12:56.598 --> 01:12:58.066
A dream?

01:12:58.099 --> 01:13:00.068
I thought I was the one
with the fucked up dreams.

01:13:00.101 --> 01:13:03.637
Yeah, I mean, it's
definitely the same.

01:13:03.670 --> 01:13:05.871
What happens in the dream?

01:13:05.905 --> 01:13:08.374
I dunno, I always wake up.

01:13:23.487 --> 01:13:24.554
Who's that?

01:13:34.363 --> 01:13:36.030
Welcome, Lauren.

01:13:36.063 --> 01:13:38.666
You have nothing to fear.

01:13:38.699 --> 01:13:42.268
What about me, do I
got anything to fear?

01:13:49.441 --> 01:13:51.642
I was supposed to find you.

01:13:51.676 --> 01:13:52.510
Yes.

01:13:53.644 --> 01:13:55.313
- Welcome home.
- Home?

01:13:56.413 --> 01:13:58.081
Who are you?

01:13:58.115 --> 01:14:00.784
I am a leader of
a forgotten tribe.

01:14:00.817 --> 01:14:05.020
The white man drove us from
our fertile lands to the east,

01:14:05.054 --> 01:14:06.222
took our game.

01:14:07.956 --> 01:14:11.959
Scoured the land for
materials precious to them,

01:14:11.992 --> 01:14:15.696
dammed the streams
that gave us water.

01:14:15.729 --> 01:14:19.365
Right here in this very
place many moons ago,

01:14:20.867 --> 01:14:24.469
we took refuge
from the white man.

01:14:24.503 --> 01:14:25.936
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

01:14:25.971 --> 01:14:28.072
Uh, there's a crazy ass
guy here killing people.

01:14:28.105 --> 01:14:29.373
We cool here?

01:14:29.407 --> 01:14:31.409
You have nothing
to fear from us.

01:14:31.442 --> 01:14:33.777
We are peaceful spirits.

01:14:33.810 --> 01:14:35.545
Stewards of the land.

01:14:36.579 --> 01:14:38.347
What happened here?

01:14:39.415 --> 01:14:41.750
I've seen things in my head.

01:14:42.785 --> 01:14:44.285
Let me show you.

01:15:28.321 --> 01:15:31.424
It was sunset when
they came; miners.

01:15:33.258 --> 01:15:35.661
They wanted the land.

01:15:35.694 --> 01:15:39.297
And the gold was worth
more than our lives.

01:19:13.504 --> 01:19:14.705
What did you see?

01:19:14.739 --> 01:19:18.241
She saw her end
and why we are here.

01:19:18.274 --> 01:19:19.643
Why are we here?

01:19:19.676 --> 01:19:21.978
Why is this happening?

01:19:22.012 --> 01:19:24.080
The miners were unbelievers,

01:19:24.114 --> 01:19:26.581
but they didn't
know what they did.

01:19:26.614 --> 01:19:30.385
But this is our land and
when they murdered us,

01:19:30.418 --> 01:19:32.920
a blood debt was created.

01:19:32.954 --> 01:19:34.821
Our spirits could
not entire into

01:19:34.855 --> 01:19:38.724
the spirit realm
without retribution.

01:19:38.758 --> 01:19:41.460
You mean you have to kill
them first to release yours?

01:19:41.494 --> 01:19:43.762
In a way, yes, but
they were very effective.

01:19:43.795 --> 01:19:45.830
There was no one
left to fight them.

01:19:45.864 --> 01:19:48.732
And only a few of my
tribe remained alive,

01:19:48.766 --> 01:19:51.502
and they were powerless.

01:19:51.535 --> 01:19:54.038
So, you've been
here this whole time?

01:19:54.071 --> 01:19:56.873
We are part of the land.

01:19:56.907 --> 01:20:01.144
And only involving innocent
people can release us now,

01:20:01.176 --> 01:20:02.577
but I will not allow it.

01:20:02.611 --> 01:20:04.578
We will not hurt
innocent people even

01:20:04.612 --> 01:20:07.581
if we must sacrifice ourselves.

01:20:07.615 --> 01:20:09.917
So, who was the crazy
guy killing people?

01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:11.986
And why?

01:20:12.019 --> 01:20:13.888
When the blood debt
was created it also

01:20:13.921 --> 01:20:16.188
tied their spirits to the land.

01:20:16.221 --> 01:20:18.091
And they need to
end every bloodline

01:20:18.124 --> 01:20:19.892
in the tribe to be released.

01:20:19.925 --> 01:20:22.660
So, so, the people he's
killing are a part of the tribe?

01:20:22.694 --> 01:20:24.529
They seem hella white to me.

01:20:24.562 --> 01:20:28.099
No, they are part of
the miners' families.

01:20:28.132 --> 01:20:32.201
Five miners, five families,
five contest winners.

01:20:34.704 --> 01:20:36.805
Why would they kill
their own families?

01:20:36.838 --> 01:20:38.174
That doesn't make any sense.

01:20:38.206 --> 01:20:40.241
Not they, him.

01:20:40.275 --> 01:20:43.544
After he murdered
many of my people,

01:20:43.577 --> 01:20:46.379
he turned on those
that helped him.

01:20:46.412 --> 01:20:49.983
Gold can drive a man
to do terrible things.

01:20:52.551 --> 01:20:55.420
He killed the others for it,

01:20:55.454 --> 01:20:57.488
and their spirits
joined ours tied

01:20:57.521 --> 01:20:59.724
to the land and
part of the debt.

01:20:59.757 --> 01:21:03.493
He needs to eliminate all
their bloodlines, too.

01:21:03.526 --> 01:21:07.496
And he needs one of
them for his plan.

01:21:21.808 --> 01:21:23.309
You have seen him.

01:21:24.211 --> 01:21:26.880
And he used people to set it up.

01:21:28.115 --> 01:21:31.016
To make sure the
right people won

01:21:31.050 --> 01:21:32.918
and to place his
weapon of choice.

01:21:36.787 --> 01:21:38.189
Rob, he helped?

01:21:39.957 --> 01:21:42.458
Well, I ain't seen
the motherfucker yet.

01:21:42.492 --> 01:21:43.426
You will.

01:21:48.263 --> 01:21:49.331
It's me.

01:21:49.364 --> 01:21:51.632
- I'm the one he wants.
- Yes.

01:21:53.101 --> 01:21:55.769
You are the last
blood of our tribe.

01:21:55.802 --> 01:21:58.705
Yeah, but which
one does he need?

01:22:03.776 --> 01:22:04.710
Hey, guys.

01:22:04.743 --> 01:22:06.611
It's just me.

01:22:06.644 --> 01:22:08.346
Dude, you're alive!

01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:10.883
Oh, that's some scary shit.

01:22:10.916 --> 01:22:13.750
I just wanna go home now.

01:22:13.784 --> 01:22:15.685
Let's get to the raft and
get the hell away from here.

01:22:15.719 --> 01:22:17.954
Wish it were that simple.

01:22:18.922 --> 01:22:21.490
You see, it has to happen here.

01:22:23.658 --> 01:22:25.426
What has to happen?

01:22:26.427 --> 01:22:27.262
The end.

01:22:28.863 --> 01:22:32.698
He has to do it here
to release his spirits.

01:22:32.732 --> 01:22:35.568
You have to do it
here to release ours.

01:22:35.601 --> 01:22:38.104
Well, that's a buzzkill.

01:22:38.137 --> 01:22:41.439
Why would you let me come
here if I'm the last one?

01:22:41.473 --> 01:22:44.075
You should want me to
stay away from this place.

01:22:44.109 --> 01:22:47.378
I will not allow
innocent life to be taken.

01:22:47.411 --> 01:22:49.679
We are an honorable people.

01:22:50.881 --> 01:22:52.515
You are here because
you're the only one

01:22:52.549 --> 01:22:54.716
that can help them and us.

01:22:57.220 --> 01:22:59.420
I had a premonition.

01:22:59.453 --> 01:23:01.089
I heard a voice from
the sky that said

01:23:01.123 --> 01:23:04.026
our pain would end on this day.

01:23:04.059 --> 01:23:05.792
I had to bring you here.

01:23:05.826 --> 01:23:07.360
Well, I hope that's true.

01:23:07.394 --> 01:23:09.896
I still don't know
what to do though.

01:23:09.930 --> 01:23:12.364
You've helped me and Dave.

01:23:12.398 --> 01:23:14.600
We're still alive
and so are you.

01:23:16.467 --> 01:23:18.270
Not for much longer.

01:23:20.604 --> 01:23:22.006
Well, well, well.

01:23:24.541 --> 01:23:26.542
Lookie what we got here.

01:23:27.845 --> 01:23:28.778
That's him!

01:23:28.811 --> 01:23:30.147
He killed Sarah.

01:23:34.116 --> 01:23:34.951
Did I?

01:23:36.650 --> 01:23:37.585
Or did you?

01:23:39.221 --> 01:23:41.122
I didn't do anything.

01:23:44.024 --> 01:23:44.925
You sure?

01:23:50.829 --> 01:23:51.763
What the?

01:24:00.604 --> 01:24:03.040
Oh, shit did you
just.

01:24:03.074 --> 01:24:04.007
You just...

01:24:05.608 --> 01:24:07.710
That never gets old.

01:24:07.743 --> 01:24:11.247
I don't know what
the fuck you just did.

01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:16.851
Seems like we need to make
this a more private affair.

01:24:46.275 --> 01:24:49.378
I've been waiting
150 years for this.

01:24:50.778 --> 01:24:54.081
It would've been sooner if
we'd gotten you the last time.

01:24:54.115 --> 01:24:56.983
What do you mean
the last time?

01:24:57.017 --> 01:25:01.453
You don't remember
your last trip out here?

01:25:01.487 --> 01:25:03.322
Seems like you should.

01:25:06.791 --> 01:25:08.927
You flipped the raft?

01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:10.028
That was you?

01:25:12.330 --> 01:25:13.230
Surprise.

01:25:25.673 --> 01:25:27.708
Let's make this a fair fight.

01:25:57.866 --> 01:25:58.968
Give it up.

01:25:59.801 --> 01:26:00.634
It's over.

01:26:02.036 --> 01:26:05.872
You know you'll never
kill an innocent person.

01:26:08.075 --> 01:26:10.344
Yes, you speak the truth.

01:26:11.676 --> 01:26:13.179
I cannot harm him.

01:26:22.252 --> 01:26:24.088
What just happened.

01:26:24.121 --> 01:26:25.022
Am I dead?

01:26:25.055 --> 01:26:27.223
You will be soon enough.

01:26:29.158 --> 01:26:33.996
No, you are still part
of the world of the living.

01:26:34.029 --> 01:26:36.865
I used your body
like he used his.

01:26:38.032 --> 01:26:38.833
Used my body?

01:26:38.866 --> 01:26:40.533
What does that mean?

01:26:41.634 --> 01:26:44.237
Don't be stupid, boy.

01:26:49.141 --> 01:26:50.976
You really don't know?

01:26:53.212 --> 01:26:54.045
We's kin.

01:27:05.553 --> 01:27:10.225
You're my blood, so my spirit
can use you in this world.

01:27:11.359 --> 01:27:14.928
So, I was the one that
killed those people?

01:27:16.562 --> 01:27:19.599
You ain't as dumb
as you look, boy.

01:27:22.502 --> 01:27:23.903
And I'll get you.

01:27:25.669 --> 01:27:28.106
You can be sure of that.

01:27:28.140 --> 01:27:30.574
Just like I got your parents.

01:27:32.675 --> 01:27:34.677
You killed my parents?

01:27:38.647 --> 01:27:39.748
Is this true?

01:27:40.616 --> 01:27:43.052
Again, he speaks the truth.

01:27:44.253 --> 01:27:47.155
I won't let you
get away with it.

01:27:50.091 --> 01:27:51.492
I already have.

01:27:54.227 --> 01:27:57.762
And there ain't nothing
you can do about it.

01:27:57.797 --> 01:28:04.002
Unless you wanna kill him.

01:28:06.670 --> 01:28:08.172
Right now.

01:28:08.205 --> 01:28:12.843
If you kill him right now
then your parents go free.

01:28:12.876 --> 01:28:16.212
Your relatives go
free, everyone!

01:28:20.348 --> 01:28:21.183
Go on.

01:28:23.151 --> 01:28:23.985
Do it.

01:28:27.154 --> 01:28:27.988
Go on!

01:28:29.556 --> 01:28:30.390
No.

01:28:33.259 --> 01:28:34.593
I won't do it.

01:28:34.626 --> 01:28:37.229
I won't spill innocent blood.

01:28:37.262 --> 01:28:38.763
That's not my way.

01:28:41.299 --> 01:28:42.800
Didn't think so.

01:28:44.734 --> 01:28:48.071
I think it's time for
everyone to leave.

01:28:49.605 --> 01:28:52.441
We'll pick this
up a little later.

01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:57.412
So, if I kill her, we win?

01:29:05.252 --> 01:29:06.819
Well, well, well.

01:29:07.987 --> 01:29:10.790
Look who's growing
himself some balls.

01:29:10.823 --> 01:29:11.656
Yeah.

01:29:12.824 --> 01:29:15.427
If you kill her
right now, we win.

01:29:17.995 --> 01:29:20.464
We get to leave this world.

01:29:22.764 --> 01:29:25.101
If she kills me, they win?

01:29:28.303 --> 01:29:31.974
You better not get
killed by no girl, boy.

01:29:49.954 --> 01:29:52.924
That's right.

01:29:52.957 --> 01:29:57.394
All my life people have
been telling me what to do.

01:30:01.097 --> 01:30:03.866
And I'm gonna do what I want.

01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:05.901
Two Rivers: I cannot help.

01:30:05.934 --> 01:30:07.536
You must defend yourself.

01:30:07.569 --> 01:30:08.470
Kyle, listen to me.

01:30:08.503 --> 01:30:09.404
You don't have to do this.

01:30:09.437 --> 01:30:10.405
We can figure something out.

01:30:10.438 --> 01:30:12.206
There's nothing to figure out.

01:30:35.659 --> 01:30:37.826
- I'm so sorry.
- Stop.

01:30:37.860 --> 01:30:42.696
It'll all be over soon.

01:30:58.977 --> 01:31:01.046
You're not so innocent now.

01:31:19.628 --> 01:31:20.461
No!

01:31:22.063 --> 01:31:24.065
What have you done?

01:31:25.899 --> 01:31:27.667
I sent you to hell.

01:31:50.419 --> 01:31:52.821
My vision has come to pass.

01:31:53.989 --> 01:31:57.691
And you have proven
yourself worthy.

01:31:57.725 --> 01:32:00.327
We can join our
ancestors in peace,

01:32:00.361 --> 01:32:01.829
and when you are
ready they'll be

01:32:01.862 --> 01:32:04.464
a place of honor for you there.

01:32:06.599 --> 01:32:08.467
Can you take me home?

01:33:16.289 --> 01:33:18.290
- Hey.
- Hey, there you are.

01:33:19.458 --> 01:33:21.226
I was wondering when
you were gonna get up.

01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:22.795
Are you feeling any better?

01:33:22.827 --> 01:33:24.362
Feeling better?

01:33:24.395 --> 01:33:29.399
Yeah, you were
sick in your room all weekend.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.368
All weekend?

01:33:31.401 --> 01:33:32.903
Yeah.

01:33:32.936 --> 01:33:34.337
I heard you coughing.

01:33:34.370 --> 01:33:36.639
Don't you remember?

01:33:36.672 --> 01:33:37.741
Not really.

01:33:39.140 --> 01:33:41.409
Maybe I took too much medicine.

01:33:41.443 --> 01:33:43.678
Yeah, done that before.

01:33:43.712 --> 01:33:45.814
Makes you feel all loopy.

01:33:47.648 --> 01:33:50.350
Oh, um, Chief
stopped by earlier.

01:33:50.383 --> 01:33:51.617
He did, what'd he say?

01:33:51.651 --> 01:33:53.386
Oh, he was
just checking in on you.

01:33:53.419 --> 01:33:55.187
Wanted to see how
you were doing.

01:33:55.220 --> 01:33:58.023
He said to give him a
call when you get up.

01:33:58.056 --> 01:34:01.092
Okay, I'm gonna
take a shower first.

01:34:01.125 --> 01:34:02.326
There you go, girl.

01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:05.096
That'll make you
feel a lot better.

01:34:15.371 --> 01:34:16.704
A crazy dream.

01:38:53.128 --> 01:38:54.997
Can you
like move away from him?

01:38:55.030 --> 01:38:57.231
I do, don't you
think it would look better?

01:38:57.265 --> 01:38:59.133
It's backwards.

01:38:59.167 --> 01:39:00.068
I getting it, I'm
picking up the talking.

01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:01.368
Oh, I see.

01:39:01.401 --> 01:39:03.771
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah, that's not right.

01:39:09.241 --> 01:39:11.242
Do you wanna
get closer or this good?

01:39:11.276 --> 01:39:14.346
That's
good right there.
