WEBVTT

00:08.176 --> 00:09.976
There will be bad things
said about me, things

00:10.010 --> 00:11.745
that perhaps you will
not recognize as acts

00:11.845 --> 00:13.647
I could have carried out.
- Not again, father.

00:13.747 --> 00:14.782
Do not leave me.

00:14.882 --> 00:17.085
You stay close to
your Samuel Drummond.

00:17.185 --> 00:18.352
Understand?

00:18.452 --> 00:19.753
Should you need
to speak with me,

00:19.853 --> 00:23.691
place a candle in your window.
- Nathaniel, is it?

00:26.627 --> 00:28.929
Those are bite marks, Reed.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.264
Flesh torn out with teeth.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.937
We find him, his capture
will bring us also

00:37.037 --> 00:38.739
his brother, Augustus Dove.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

00:49.383 --> 00:50.451
Where did he say?

00:50.551 --> 00:51.785
Somewhere.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.288
It is a whole system of tunnels.
- Hide.

00:54.388 --> 00:55.388
I shall find you.

01:03.231 --> 01:04.230
Bennet!

01:06.867 --> 01:09.203
Bennet!
- Cut me open.

01:09.303 --> 01:11.172
Bleed out my heart.

01:11.272 --> 01:13.874
But all you will
find there is dust.

01:29.723 --> 01:32.059
Bennet, you fight.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.995
You fight.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.095
No, my friend.

01:42.035 --> 01:43.035
No more fighting.

01:48.809 --> 01:49.809
No!

02:15.369 --> 02:16.170
Undertaker.

02:16.270 --> 02:17.405
Yes, sir.

02:17.505 --> 02:19.773
A closed casket for
this man, if you will.

04:56.029 --> 04:58.899
Reid, Reid.

05:01.635 --> 05:02.635
What do you say?

05:06.139 --> 05:08.308
Three nights we've
been down here.

05:08.409 --> 05:11.779
This day, every uniform
from the city to the marshes

05:11.879 --> 05:13.581
is gonna be at his gravesite.

05:13.681 --> 05:17.551
If we're quick about
it, we can move freely.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.520
Where?

05:19.620 --> 05:26.259
Someplace that ain't a sewer,
where we can sleep, eat.

05:26.360 --> 05:26.994
Then say.

05:27.094 --> 05:29.363
If I say, you won't go.

05:40.574 --> 05:42.876
That thing's more
conspicuous than you are.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.845
This way now.
Quick.

06:05.232 --> 06:06.233
Come.

06:06.333 --> 06:07.973
The stage door gives
out onto the laneway.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.309
Here.
There's food.

06:59.352 --> 07:00.564
You think you'd
have the decency

07:00.588 --> 07:02.523
to keep your murderous
fingers off my lunch.

07:05.459 --> 07:08.729
All the decayed ruins in this
town and you bring me to hers?

07:08.829 --> 07:09.829
I did warn you.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.975
It's a real nice place
you got here, Hermione.

08:29.209 --> 08:30.477
beast lies dead.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.148
All right.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.083
Let me tell you what
he said about you.

08:37.183 --> 08:37.885
Hey, I've had you.

08:37.985 --> 08:38.986
That's right.

08:39.086 --> 08:40.988
They're skills, that savagery.

08:43.957 --> 08:44.957
Who's next?

08:45.025 --> 08:46.459
Hey?

08:46.560 --> 08:48.428
Who dare risk their
animal against mine?

09:01.775 --> 09:02.775
This way.

09:15.355 --> 09:16.256
Would not if I
were you, brother.

09:16.356 --> 09:18.358
He ain't the petting kind.

09:18.458 --> 09:19.226
What kind is he?

09:19.326 --> 09:21.061
The killing kind.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.596
Is that so?

09:22.696 --> 09:23.864
What you want?

09:23.964 --> 09:25.799
I want your dog.

09:25.899 --> 09:26.899
Well, you can't have him.

09:31.138 --> 09:32.539
No, we're done.

09:32.640 --> 09:35.242
Wait, don't hurt me!

09:35.342 --> 09:38.245
Please.

09:38.345 --> 09:39.747
Hey!

09:47.020 --> 09:48.822
Good boy.
Good boy.

09:48.922 --> 09:49.790
Come on.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.925
Come on.

09:52.025 --> 09:55.228
You come with me, boy.
You're mine now.

10:09.042 --> 10:11.311
Why Inspector Reid
resorted to such action

10:11.411 --> 10:14.882
is a question that may only be
answered by the man himself.

10:14.982 --> 10:17.217
But the facts of the
ghastly fate suffered by Mr.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.787
Swift cannot be ignored.

10:19.887 --> 10:22.455
The recorded cause of
death was dehydration,

10:22.555 --> 10:24.658
but that eventual end
must, one imagines,

10:24.758 --> 10:27.861
have come as mighty relief
for a once eminent man

10:27.961 --> 10:29.697
who had lived for 10
days in conditions

10:29.797 --> 10:32.365
which defy imagination.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.168
10 days in which his body,
in starving desperation,

10:35.268 --> 10:38.238
would have slowly turned to
eating itself, before death

10:38.338 --> 10:41.308
came to spare him
for the suffering.

10:41.408 --> 10:44.077
Before that blessed hour,
however, dehydration would have

10:44.177 --> 10:46.747
brought him to a mad delirium.

10:46.847 --> 10:49.649
In that state, he had chewed
his own tongue to ribbons,

10:49.750 --> 10:52.352
and shattered the bones
of his fingers and wrists

10:52.452 --> 10:56.189
in repeated attempts to break
down the bars of his prison.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.225
As for Mr. Reid,
the only man who

10:58.325 --> 11:00.393
might shed light on
whose own motives,

11:00.493 --> 11:01.962
his whereabouts remain unknown.

11:07.134 --> 11:11.271
There is more food and water,
too, if you would like to wash.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.306
And believe me,
you ought to do so.

11:13.406 --> 11:15.809
Because never mind talk
of you, I expect the stink

11:15.909 --> 11:17.144
carries to Scotland Yard.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.190
How do we know
she may be trusted?

11:21.214 --> 11:23.026
I imagine that depends on
whether you intend to become

11:23.050 --> 11:24.251
charming or not, Mr. Reid.

11:27.154 --> 11:28.956
You, might I have
a word, please?

11:44.037 --> 11:45.438
Where is it you go, Mr. Reid?

11:45.538 --> 11:47.407
Get eyes on my girl if I can.

11:47.507 --> 11:49.743
See if she's lit her
candle to call for me.

11:49.843 --> 11:51.711
I shan't expose
you if I'm taken,

11:51.812 --> 11:55.048
were that your chief concern.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.588
When is it you are
planning to leave?

11:56.616 --> 11:58.685
You are running, I imagine.
- We are.

11:58.786 --> 12:00.821
Then, why are you
in my play house?

12:00.921 --> 12:01.989
All the ports are watched.

12:02.089 --> 12:08.361
And besides me and Susan,
we're a family now.

12:08.461 --> 12:10.998
You will not leave
your son behind?

12:11.098 --> 12:12.699
No.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.201
And Mr. Reid?

12:14.301 --> 12:15.301
Pour two.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.539
Reid.

12:19.639 --> 12:26.046
Yeah, look, his gruffness, He's
barely spoken two words since.

12:26.146 --> 12:26.746
Since what?

12:26.847 --> 12:28.248
Since they came for him?

12:28.348 --> 12:29.348
No.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.654
Since we watched Drake die.

12:40.693 --> 12:41.862
You were there?

12:41.962 --> 12:44.798
When that man Abel
Croker murdered him?

12:44.898 --> 12:47.067
Don't believe everything
you read in the newspapers.

12:47.167 --> 12:49.102
Did he not in fact
murder Inspector Drake?

12:49.202 --> 12:50.446
Was the man fitted
for the crime?

12:50.470 --> 12:51.504
It's best you don't know.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.406
Then that which Mr.
Reid is accused of,

12:53.506 --> 12:56.409
what happened to Miss Swift out
there's father, is that it also

12:56.509 --> 12:58.311
a questionable
version of events?

12:58.411 --> 13:01.248
Is he, is she, in
fact blameless?

13:01.348 --> 13:04.017
Blameless?
Never that.

13:06.820 --> 13:10.790
And to think when I read of
her supposed passing... I mean,

13:10.891 --> 13:15.896
I should be shot, but
I... I sorrowed for you.

13:15.996 --> 13:16.830
Mimi, darling...

13:16.930 --> 13:17.831
Don't call me "darling."

13:17.931 --> 13:19.275
You call me "darling"
one more time,

13:19.299 --> 13:20.979
and I will walk you to
Leman Street myself.

13:24.571 --> 13:29.009
I don't understand how
you dare come to me.

13:29.109 --> 13:31.044
Was there no one nowhere else?

13:31.144 --> 13:32.545
Oh, we had a long list.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.133
No candle?

15:00.233 --> 15:02.469
Well, she has Drummond
staying with her, right?

15:02.569 --> 15:03.569
Correct.

15:06.940 --> 15:12.079
And all the while, Augustus
Dove, that brother of his,

15:12.179 --> 15:14.147
now hid in some
safe place while he

15:14.247 --> 15:16.516
makes certain the
world is fully apprised

15:16.616 --> 15:18.451
of the evil I have done.

15:18.551 --> 15:20.153
And I may not protest.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.322
And I may not hold
my girl and explain

15:22.422 --> 15:27.794
to her the ghastly truth of
her Uncle Bennet's passing.

15:27.894 --> 15:31.164
Hey, Reid, she knows that
truth, she then knows danger.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.433
And you're in no place too
offer her your protection.

15:33.533 --> 15:36.736
We must continue
to cower, must we?

15:36.836 --> 15:40.673
And while the world is
poisoned, justice and truth

15:40.773 --> 15:43.810
are made August Dove's whores.

15:43.910 --> 15:46.213
What are we to do then, Reid?

15:46.313 --> 15:47.313
We go get our justice.

15:50.150 --> 15:51.150
Let the heavens fall.

16:06.699 --> 16:07.699
What will you do?

16:11.038 --> 16:13.206
What can he do?

16:13.306 --> 16:15.742
He chooses to fix
his will to vengeance,

16:15.842 --> 16:17.810
he will tear this
world down about us.

16:17.910 --> 16:20.147
Maggie, you don't
wish for justice?

16:20.247 --> 16:23.383
You're asking the wrong woman
entirely the wrong question.

16:23.483 --> 16:27.620
Whatever common factors shared
by Miss Morton and myself,

16:27.720 --> 16:29.756
I am today grateful for them.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.991
But we cannot imagine
ourselves protected by her.

16:32.092 --> 16:34.327
So you believe her disloyal?

16:34.427 --> 16:36.629
What motive does she
have to lean to loyalty

16:36.729 --> 16:39.099
when she brings you to mind?

16:39.199 --> 16:42.302
We do not act, you
and I, whether it

16:42.402 --> 16:46.406
is with fury or another's
idle tongue-we must ask

16:46.506 --> 16:47.374
is all I say.

16:47.474 --> 16:48.834
And this great
action you describe?

16:52.445 --> 16:54.657
Our vases, I have a sense of
where Croker may have hid them.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.716
If that sense is accurate,
there is not a soul

16:56.816 --> 16:57.950
left to stop me taking them.

16:58.051 --> 17:00.096
You don't think you're gonna
be seen on the dockside?

17:00.120 --> 17:02.489
Yes, and I have a thought on
how that might be addressed.

17:05.258 --> 17:06.258
I don't like it, Caitlin.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.501
I'll go.

17:14.601 --> 17:17.470
You just... you stay
here where it's safe.

17:17.569 --> 17:18.704
No.

17:18.805 --> 17:21.108
Because you must go to
Connor, set eyes on our son,

17:21.208 --> 17:24.010
if you can.

17:24.111 --> 17:27.114
All that has passed in the
house which he must call home.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.316
We must see that
he's well, Matthew.

17:29.416 --> 17:30.696
And I will be watched for there.

17:34.254 --> 17:37.657
Darling, we are watched
for everywhere by everybody.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.126
No.
No.

17:39.226 --> 17:41.027
Not everywhere.

17:41.128 --> 17:43.930
What was that fixation, anyway?

17:44.030 --> 17:45.374
Besides, what is a
theater if not a place

17:45.398 --> 17:48.067
in which we might transform
ourselves, transform myself?

17:59.346 --> 18:01.181
What?

18:01.281 --> 18:04.484
You be careful.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.624
'Cause I might fall in love
with you all over again.

18:34.347 --> 18:36.716
This new chief of ours
who comes in this morning,

18:36.816 --> 18:39.186
he's a proper heavy weight,
from what they say, right?

18:39.286 --> 18:41.954
And OK, when he ran
Limehouse, 10 commission's

18:42.054 --> 18:44.391
recommendations in one year.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.331
Nigh on 50 nicker, one
from the Bow Street farm

18:46.426 --> 18:49.028
found for bringing down an
armed robbery single handed.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.097
That was about five
years past, Frank.

18:51.198 --> 18:52.332
Where's he been since, eh?

18:52.432 --> 18:54.009
And now he comes here
to run this division.

18:54.033 --> 18:55.578
From the sound of it,
he's entirely the strike

18:55.602 --> 18:57.737
of man required for
this sink in which we

18:57.837 --> 18:59.138
here currently find ourselves.

18:59.239 --> 19:02.108
And I for one should be happy
to walk alongside such a man.

19:02.209 --> 19:04.611
Aye, fall on your
ass.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.646
Oi.

19:06.746 --> 19:07.914
I've been robbed.
- Name?

19:08.014 --> 19:09.115
- Why do you need
- That?

19:09.216 --> 19:10.926
So we can come by and
cook your dinner for you.

19:10.950 --> 19:11.994
It is a legal requirement, sir.

19:12.018 --> 19:13.018
Oh

19:13.085 --> 19:14.554
Oh.
It's Jenkins.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.155
And what is took from you, sir?

19:16.256 --> 19:16.956
My dog.

19:17.056 --> 19:17.690
Breed?

19:17.790 --> 19:19.659
English bull terrier.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.039
Well, it's a
fighting dog, is it?

19:23.763 --> 19:24.997
It is not.

19:25.097 --> 19:27.634
It's my domestic companion.

19:27.734 --> 19:29.536
It's pure breed, understand?

19:29.636 --> 19:31.638
25 pound to replace.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.306
Some pet.

19:33.406 --> 19:36.609
You see those scars
about his hands, Drum?

19:36.709 --> 19:39.646
I'll have my pension on it
that's a pit bull,

19:39.746 --> 19:41.414
and he's a pit bull handler.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.049
Now, you just be
glad we here are

19:43.149 --> 19:44.327
currently exercised
by graver matter

19:44.351 --> 19:47.186
than a bollack sack like you.

19:47.287 --> 19:49.389
Mr. Dove comes, the
new chief with him!

19:53.693 --> 19:54.853
Get out of here, Mr. Jenkins.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.653
Men of H Division,
I expect you to show

20:20.753 --> 20:23.956
your new leader all the
loyalty you showed your last.

20:51.484 --> 20:52.484
Your men welcome you.

20:57.557 --> 20:59.959
Portland stone
pillars, Mr. Shine.

21:00.059 --> 21:05.164
Money's been spent or lost,
depending on your outlook.

21:25.051 --> 21:26.051
What is that?

21:28.921 --> 21:30.232
It is a telephone,
Inspector Shine.

21:30.256 --> 21:31.624
You are desk sergeant?

21:31.724 --> 21:33.826
Drummond, sir.

21:33.926 --> 21:35.995
I know what a
telephone is, Drummond.

21:36.095 --> 21:37.330
Of course.

21:37.430 --> 21:41.401
Perhaps Mr. Shine refers to
your micro reader, Sergeant.

21:41.501 --> 21:43.570
Um, Mr. Reid's files
were photographed

21:43.670 --> 21:47.807
and their size then shrunk
by a ratio of 160 to 1.

21:47.907 --> 21:49.376
Ed Reid.

21:49.476 --> 21:50.777
Hm?

21:50.877 --> 21:52.945
This Reid?

21:53.045 --> 21:55.515
His brain made put
in glass, is it?

21:55.615 --> 21:58.818
Shall we move on?
- Gentlemen.

22:03.289 --> 22:05.658
You do know
the American position.

22:05.758 --> 22:07.460
That is your
prerogative, Mr. Shine.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.828
No, it's not mine.

22:08.928 --> 22:11.764
In truth, I do not have any care
for such empirical probings.

22:11.864 --> 22:12.864
Lead on, Drummond.

22:18.405 --> 22:20.840
No wonder you suffer such
strife in this division, sir.

22:20.940 --> 22:25.177
This bang-up is not full
enough, not near, Mr. Dove.

22:25.277 --> 22:27.814
This needs setting.

22:27.914 --> 22:29.148
Then see it set, Mr. Shine.

22:54.707 --> 22:55.942
This was Bennett Drake's seat.

22:58.845 --> 23:00.647
It was.

23:00.747 --> 23:01.987
How soon are
great men replaced.

23:05.017 --> 23:08.555
Who was this man, Croker,
this Whitechapel?

23:08.655 --> 23:11.524
A wharfinger, a nobody.

23:11.624 --> 23:15.662
A nobody ended Bennett Drake?

23:15.762 --> 23:17.997
Ate his flesh, four
others besides?

23:21.100 --> 23:22.100
That is not a nobody.

23:26.338 --> 23:30.777
The file in front of you,
all you need know on Mr. Reid.

23:30.877 --> 23:34.814
These charges, justifiable
homicide, truthful or cooked?

23:34.914 --> 23:36.616
It is all there, Inspector.

23:36.716 --> 23:42.889
Ed Reid called to my desk once.

23:42.989 --> 23:47.026
So I fought Bennett
Drake for the Lafone Cup.

23:47.126 --> 23:49.261
Drake was base sergeant then.

23:49.361 --> 23:51.564
And Reid ordered him to it.

23:51.664 --> 23:53.099
Would youmind
finishing, Mr. Dove?

23:53.199 --> 23:55.301
Well, Mr. Drake disobeyed him.

23:55.401 --> 23:58.605
It was widely spoke of
for many years after.

23:58.705 --> 23:59.905
He saved your life, Mr. Shine.

24:10.049 --> 24:15.755
As I understand it, the doctors
have passed you fit, Inspector.

24:15.855 --> 24:17.990
Because I threatened to
burn down their homes if they

24:18.090 --> 24:19.090
did not.

24:25.164 --> 24:28.367
Well, I expect you to be well
enough for your duties here,

24:28.467 --> 24:31.203
chief amongst which, the
capture of these fugitives.

24:31.303 --> 24:32.404
So I understand it, sir.

24:32.505 --> 24:34.574
For why is it you
believe I've accepted

24:34.674 --> 24:36.809
your invitation back here?

24:36.909 --> 24:44.416
Bring in this man,
this retribution,

24:44.517 --> 24:47.554
well, that'll be the
highest of high days.

25:52.484 --> 25:53.620
I have coffee and hot rolls.

26:11.270 --> 26:14.841
Thank you, Miss Morton.

26:14.941 --> 26:18.177
I hope you will forgive
me my poor manners.

26:18.277 --> 26:20.046
Oh come, Mr. Reid.

26:20.146 --> 26:21.781
I've heard worse.

26:21.881 --> 26:22.961
You're hardly a scaffolder.

26:38.965 --> 26:42.368
You had left this
place, had you not?

26:42.468 --> 26:46.038
Why is it you come
back here, Miss Morton?

26:46.138 --> 26:52.712
I'm happy here, happier than
I am anywhere else at least.

26:52.812 --> 26:55.815
You cannot settle over west?

26:55.915 --> 26:58.785
No.

26:58.885 --> 27:02.088
It's diverting for a while.

27:02.188 --> 27:04.556
When... when I'm there,
I think of here.

27:51.037 --> 27:52.957
You don't think I can
deal with that turd up top?

28:02.448 --> 28:05.484
Where's our boy, Rose?

28:05.584 --> 28:08.254
Wouldn't you like to know?

28:08.354 --> 28:12.224
Tell me why you're here, I'll
tell you where he is likewise.

28:12.324 --> 28:15.361
You're gonna tell
me now, goddamn it.

28:15.461 --> 28:18.731
You think I give two
hoots to be made dead?

28:18.831 --> 28:20.900
I do not.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.202
There's twice a day
it's only weariness

28:23.302 --> 28:24.703
stops me doing it myself.

28:32.779 --> 28:33.612
Where'd you go?

28:33.712 --> 28:36.248
I see your life's
all packed away.

28:36.348 --> 28:38.584
They will have me at
Blackpool for a season.

28:38.684 --> 28:39.684
And then?

28:39.718 --> 28:41.553
I do not care.
Somewhere.

28:47.426 --> 28:48.460
Where's my son, Rose?

28:52.531 --> 28:54.433
What is your name?

28:54.533 --> 28:56.836
My name's Matthew Judge.

28:56.936 --> 28:58.637
What is hers?

28:58.737 --> 28:59.839
Caitlin.

28:59.939 --> 29:02.842
And despite what you
believe, she's your friend,

29:02.942 --> 29:05.677
and she loves you.

29:05.778 --> 29:08.547
As do I, Rose.

29:08.647 --> 29:11.383
And how we understand the
time between then and now,

29:11.483 --> 29:13.185
I have no clue, but
it's true, Rose.

29:13.285 --> 29:14.285
You are loved.

29:21.427 --> 29:22.427
Where's Connor?

29:26.732 --> 29:33.840
I could not even be
close to him after Bennet.

29:37.844 --> 29:39.411
When I looked at
the child, I could

29:39.511 --> 29:47.119
see ought but her and you.

29:47.219 --> 29:48.554
Could feel ought but hate.

29:53.359 --> 29:54.359
I have given him away.

29:57.363 --> 29:59.065
Goddamn it.

29:59.165 --> 30:01.300
To who?

30:01.400 --> 30:02.400
Rose, to who?

30:02.468 --> 30:05.371
To a life that you
will not prise him from.

30:10.209 --> 30:11.810
They are papers.

30:11.911 --> 30:14.146
Connor Judge is now the
ward of Augustus Dove.

30:17.716 --> 30:19.685
Rose, where is he?
I beg you.

30:19.785 --> 30:22.021
Hackney, he has said,
but I do not know where

30:22.121 --> 30:23.489
and I do not wish
to know neither.

30:27.126 --> 30:32.164
Will you leave me,
please, Captain?

31:28.120 --> 31:29.120
I'm.

31:31.457 --> 31:34.193
He'll be glad for more
permanent company, I believe.

31:34.293 --> 31:35.294
He grows restless.

31:35.394 --> 31:36.528
It's not company he needs.

31:36.628 --> 31:37.829
It's order.

31:37.930 --> 31:40.166
Or has the moral discipline
I was brought to cheer you

31:40.266 --> 31:42.901
as a foul-mouthed mud
larking boy forgotten now you

31:43.002 --> 31:45.404
are a frock-coated gentleman?

31:45.504 --> 31:48.374
No, of course
not, Mrs. Headley.

31:48.474 --> 31:49.708
Oh, see.

31:49.808 --> 31:51.008
He comes to greet you himself.

31:56.348 --> 31:58.217
Well, Connor, do you
have a word of greeting

31:58.317 --> 31:59.317
for your new governess?

32:22.741 --> 32:24.143
Excuse me, out of the way.

32:24.243 --> 32:26.945
Police coming through.
Move.

32:27.046 --> 32:28.046
Make way.

32:46.198 --> 32:47.533
His name is Nathaniel.

32:47.633 --> 32:49.101
A nud two yards in height.

32:49.201 --> 32:51.537
He'll be rough and
dirty, but you see him,

32:51.637 --> 32:54.140
you treat him kind.

32:54.240 --> 32:57.943
And Constable, this is
not police business.

32:58.044 --> 32:58.677
This is my own affair.

32:58.777 --> 32:59.411
You understand?

32:59.511 --> 33:00.511
Yes, Mr. Dove.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.456
Mr. Dove thinks he can
set the hour of the world

33:10.556 --> 33:13.092
by his own
pocketwatch, surveying

33:13.192 --> 33:14.960
the dogs like the
heir Abel Croker

33:15.061 --> 33:18.030
might have wished him to be.

33:18.130 --> 33:20.466
And he has your son.

33:20.566 --> 33:22.601
He knows you will not
leave without him,

33:22.701 --> 33:24.470
cannot but try to retake him.

33:24.570 --> 33:26.138
He's correct on both counts.

33:26.238 --> 33:29.375
He does not have all
within his control, however.

33:29.475 --> 33:30.785
He does not take
his private guard

33:30.809 --> 33:33.545
to the docks for his health.

33:33.645 --> 33:35.447
Nor, indeed, to seek our vases.

33:35.547 --> 33:37.916
You mean he looks Nathaniel.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.119
He must hunt him himself.

33:40.219 --> 33:43.555
Because if that man kills
again, if he even speaks,

33:43.655 --> 33:45.757
Dove himself will fall.

33:45.857 --> 33:48.694
All I have done, what you
and I did to your father,

33:48.794 --> 33:51.197
perhaps I am as black of
heart as Augustus Dove

33:51.297 --> 33:55.934
would have the world believe,
but Bennet Drake, my friend,

33:56.034 --> 33:58.204
was not.

33:58.304 --> 34:00.572
There never was a more
dedicated or honest soul.

34:00.672 --> 34:02.908
God knows I used that
integrity to my own ends,

34:03.008 --> 34:08.280
but before I die, I will see
his voice given back to him.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.260
Then we need to trap the
beast which killed him.

34:13.485 --> 34:16.955
What makes you so certain he
hides in the Jewish quarter?

34:17.054 --> 34:20.259
Nathaniel has lost
everything,.

34:20.359 --> 34:22.360
Whatever kind of father
the man Croker was to him,

34:22.460 --> 34:24.663
he cannot simply call on his
brother to ask for a bed.

34:24.763 --> 34:26.598
He must wait for that
brother to find him.

34:26.697 --> 34:28.766
Cannot stray too
far, therefore.

34:28.867 --> 34:30.101
And like any human male...

34:30.202 --> 34:32.771
Any mammal, any wolf cub.

34:32.871 --> 34:36.408
He may seek comfort in
where he found it before.

34:36.507 --> 34:38.043
Amongst the people
he's preyed on.

34:41.647 --> 34:44.216
The last three days,
a man, early 30s.

34:44.315 --> 34:46.318
Don't talk much, but when
he does, it's English.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.654
No stranger.
Will know his way about.

34:48.754 --> 34:49.821
Yeah, this man.

34:49.920 --> 34:51.723
I had him Friday out.
- Why?

34:54.326 --> 34:55.326
No dogs.

35:05.271 --> 35:06.271
Lamb chops.

35:06.338 --> 35:08.607
Costly eating to give
away to an animal.

35:08.707 --> 35:11.577
Is he fattening it up?

35:11.677 --> 35:12.878
What breed?

35:12.978 --> 35:15.447
Bull terrier, a
brute of a thing.

35:15.547 --> 35:16.348
Fight dog?

35:16.448 --> 35:18.550
A way to raise
funds, certainly.

35:18.650 --> 35:19.650
Where is he fighting?

35:23.689 --> 35:24.423
What is this?

35:24.523 --> 35:25.991
Church of the latter-day saints.

35:26.091 --> 35:27.893
You think it's code?

35:27.993 --> 35:29.628
Well, street cry
would be unwise.

35:29.728 --> 35:31.297
The whereabouts
of their match-ups

35:31.397 --> 35:34.032
must be communicated somehow.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.001
Last I knew, there were
no Mormons setting up

35:36.101 --> 35:37.403
church in Whitechapel.

35:42.341 --> 35:46.912
See there, tending to his flock.

35:47.012 --> 35:48.947
Peace be upon you.

35:49.047 --> 35:51.683
And upon you, brother.

35:51.783 --> 35:52.984
Do you wish to give thanks?

35:53.084 --> 35:53.985
We do.

35:54.085 --> 35:55.085
Cassock or congregation.

35:57.856 --> 36:00.158
Fight or play?
- Play.

36:07.499 --> 36:08.499
That's your brother?

36:13.104 --> 36:14.104
Lovely.

36:18.076 --> 36:19.356
All right, let's get it started!

36:41.300 --> 36:42.334
Fear not, Abel.

36:42.434 --> 36:43.869
Fear not.

36:43.969 --> 36:45.289
We ain't here to
watch 'em suffer.

37:13.098 --> 37:14.098
What are you doing?

37:18.737 --> 37:19.737
Oi, you.

37:22.408 --> 37:25.544
You have some brass to come here
to my kingdom with that animal,

37:25.644 --> 37:27.413
a dog I raised.

37:27.513 --> 37:28.790
Raised for violence,
raised for blood.

37:28.814 --> 37:32.451
That dog was bought as
such, so you give him up now!

37:32.551 --> 37:33.552
Give him up!

37:33.652 --> 37:34.520
As you wish.

37:34.620 --> 37:36.021
Go on!

37:46.498 --> 37:48.066
Abel.

38:09.655 --> 38:11.490
You, tell what
has happened here.

38:11.590 --> 38:12.591
Reid, I see him!

38:12.691 --> 38:14.593
Get after him, then!

38:14.693 --> 38:15.561
We're gonna lose him!

38:15.661 --> 38:17.228
We must not.

38:19.331 --> 38:22.200
Come on, boy, come on.
Come on, boy.

38:32.744 --> 38:33.984
Who's it brings
the coffee here?

38:34.079 --> 38:35.981
That'd be Sergeant
Drummond, sir.

38:36.081 --> 38:38.249
We leave all matters
domestic to him.

38:38.350 --> 38:40.419
That's a good drink,
Sergeant Drummond.

38:40.519 --> 38:41.620
Thank you, sir.

38:41.720 --> 38:43.855
Is it you who instead of
his own soft bed warms his

38:43.955 --> 38:45.624
in
Miss Mathilda Reid?

38:45.724 --> 38:47.459
It is, Mr. Shine.

38:47.559 --> 38:49.027
Sleeps like a dog there.

38:49.127 --> 38:51.630
Well, dogs are loyal, mister?

38:51.730 --> 38:54.666
Thatcher, DS, sir.

38:54.766 --> 38:57.268
Mr. Drummond, would you be
so kind as to introduce me

38:57.369 --> 38:58.637
to the young lady.

38:58.737 --> 39:00.657
I would find it an honor
to lay my eyes upon her.

39:03.842 --> 39:04.842
Of course, sir.

39:13.485 --> 39:16.688
The smell of this town,
Drummond, I do not think I

39:16.788 --> 39:21.427
could mistake it though I live
to be 500... shit,

39:21.527 --> 39:23.562
bad gin, and dead flowers.

39:27.098 --> 39:32.871
Miss Reid, I am to introduce
you to Inspector Shine.

39:32.971 --> 39:34.816
I'm pleased to make your
acquaintance, Mr. Shine.

39:34.840 --> 39:35.840
Miss Reid.

39:39.044 --> 39:40.646
What is this work you do?

39:40.746 --> 39:43.682
I'm a researcher for the
work of Mr. Charles Booth.

39:43.782 --> 39:44.650
Yeah?

39:44.750 --> 39:46.317
And what do you research?

39:46.418 --> 39:49.688
How people live
on what they have.

39:49.788 --> 39:52.023
Well, I hope you'll
let me know the answer,

39:52.123 --> 39:56.361
because that is a skill I
am yet to master myself.

39:56.462 --> 39:58.997
Will you excuse
me, Inspector Shine.

39:59.097 --> 40:01.232
You know, your news
traveled to Ireland,

40:01.332 --> 40:02.601
where I worked at the time.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.704
Forgive me.
Which news?

40:11.477 --> 40:12.477
Your resurrection.

40:15.947 --> 40:16.648
Sir, ought we not to...

40:16.748 --> 40:18.817
No, you ought not, Drummond.

40:18.917 --> 40:23.789
I share the experience,
see, of all having thought

40:23.889 --> 40:28.359
me gone only to be restored.

40:28.460 --> 40:32.464
Who else may say that,
save yourself and myself?

40:32.564 --> 40:36.535
Man may stop and wonder
if perhaps we are kin, you

40:36.635 --> 40:44.635
and I. You should know, it is
me now that hunts your Pappy.

40:44.876 --> 40:46.277
Drum?

40:46.377 --> 40:52.150
I wish you only to know
this... whatever may pass,

40:52.250 --> 40:54.886
you will always have a
defender in Jedediah Shine.

40:57.856 --> 41:01.092
Life is precious,
Miss, particularly

41:01.192 --> 41:02.232
that which is given twice.

41:09.300 --> 41:10.300
Good day, Miss Reid.

41:26.117 --> 41:27.753
You think we were seen?

41:27.853 --> 41:29.797
An American shooting his
pistol off in broad daylight?

41:29.821 --> 41:31.101
Who would remark
on such a thing?

41:31.189 --> 41:32.691
Hey, he's the animal we hunt.

41:32.791 --> 41:34.001
What the hell was
I supposed to do?

41:34.025 --> 41:35.393
Not kill him, for one.

41:35.493 --> 41:38.697
His use to us dead
is exactly nil.

41:38.797 --> 41:40.875
That man, Nathaniel, what...
what is it that he hunts?

41:40.899 --> 41:42.844
The chaos back there, the
unleashed fighting dogs,

41:42.868 --> 41:44.178
he is releasing them,
not fighting them.

41:44.202 --> 41:46.071
An act of liberation,
not violence.

41:46.171 --> 41:47.172
From a violent man.

41:47.272 --> 41:49.908
Well, dogs ain't just
dogs to Nathaniel.

41:50.008 --> 41:51.142
What, then?

41:51.242 --> 41:55.280
His wolf brothers, who
he now seeks to free?

41:55.380 --> 41:57.115
An act of compassion
from a man who tore

41:57.215 --> 41:58.550
my friend's throat from him.

41:58.650 --> 42:03.254
I hear Susan said he's more
of a man-child than a monster.

42:03.354 --> 42:06.357
He may have developed
an affection for her,

42:06.457 --> 42:08.760
and she for him, I believe.

42:08.860 --> 42:10.528
So this compassion
he has for the dogs,

42:10.629 --> 42:12.549
we must assume he will
persevere with these acts.

42:12.631 --> 42:14.709
Unless his brother may lay
hands on him and stop him.

42:14.733 --> 42:17.736
We must hope he does
not trap him once more.

42:17.836 --> 42:19.270
More Methodist pit fights then?

42:19.370 --> 42:20.872
Yes, until we have him, yes.

42:20.972 --> 42:23.052
And perhaps Miss Swift may
use their mutual affection

42:23.141 --> 42:24.301
and turn him to our own ends.

42:39.257 --> 42:41.927
It is a great risk you take
for a man who let you down so.

42:50.301 --> 42:52.971
He betrayed me with you.

42:53.071 --> 42:55.273
Then you see my argument.

42:55.373 --> 42:56.733
Why not turn us
out to the streets?

42:59.177 --> 43:00.337
He's very charming, your man.

43:02.914 --> 43:03.581
He is.

43:03.682 --> 43:05.416
He's also an idiot.

43:05.516 --> 43:07.185
But if in this life,
we do not trust

43:07.285 --> 43:09.688
our instinct as to
who is a good person,

43:09.788 --> 43:11.068
then I think we might be ruined.

43:13.759 --> 43:16.427
It's Hackney, is it not,
where, according to Rose Drake,

43:16.527 --> 43:20.666
this Mr. Dove now resides?
- It is.

43:25.236 --> 43:27.839
Now that it lives again, I
must reregister my theater here

43:27.939 --> 43:29.875
for its purpose.

43:29.975 --> 43:32.543
I do so via a young man called
Eric at the land registry

43:32.644 --> 43:34.880
in Lincoln's Inn Fields.

43:34.980 --> 43:38.116
Mr. Dove, good man of
the Lord that he is,

43:38.216 --> 43:39.576
must also register
his new domicile

43:39.617 --> 43:42.788
for gas, waterworks, the like.

43:42.888 --> 43:44.956
Dear Eric is a little bit
in love with me, I think.

43:56.768 --> 43:59.168
He makes a household there and
will be advertising for staff,

43:59.237 --> 44:00.237
I imagine.

44:04.943 --> 44:07.545
Do you know, Miss Morton,
we have far too much

44:07.645 --> 44:08.765
in common not to be friends.

44:19.057 --> 44:21.259
Pit fight at the old woolworks.

44:21.359 --> 44:22.469
Word is the dogs were released.

44:22.493 --> 44:24.253
They're now scattered
throughout Whitechapel.

44:27.132 --> 44:28.934
Figure you're immune
to arrest, Jenkins?

44:29.034 --> 44:30.034
Perhaps, I am.

44:34.940 --> 44:37.776
The ruckus what saw
these dogs set loose,

44:37.876 --> 44:41.279
your men here in attendance,
in a pursuit all their own,

44:41.379 --> 44:44.515
a pursuit of the wretch what
thieved my dog, Chopper.

44:44.615 --> 44:45.784
You're not so spry now.

44:45.884 --> 44:47.118
Hello, Mr. Jenkins.

44:50.021 --> 44:52.257
That is valuable intelligence.

44:52.357 --> 44:53.024
No mistake.

44:53.124 --> 44:54.525
Don't I know it.

44:54.625 --> 44:59.330
Then perhaps you will allow
us to show you our gratitude.

44:59.430 --> 45:01.466
By all means, Inspector.

45:01.566 --> 45:02.566
Hold this.

45:16.347 --> 45:17.347
Higher.

45:19.785 --> 45:20.785
Higher.

45:23.721 --> 45:24.721
Higher.

45:29.394 --> 45:32.497
Now, Mr. Jenkins,
you dance there

45:32.597 --> 45:34.833
on your tippy toes
for an hour or four

45:34.933 --> 45:38.003
while we establish the truth of
your snitching on Edwin Reid.

45:41.973 --> 45:43.053
With me, Sergeant Thatcher.

45:48.679 --> 45:49.679
Yes, sir, Mr. Shine.

46:02.994 --> 46:06.531
Inspector Shine, sir, I think
you might wanna come see this.

46:09.167 --> 46:10.167
Come on.

46:17.342 --> 46:20.278
Mr. Thatcher, can
you bring to mind

46:20.378 --> 46:28.378
any man of these parts who might
have need for a 0.45 cartridge?

46:29.154 --> 46:32.123
Yeah, I can, Inspector.

46:32.223 --> 46:33.423
That would be Captain Jackson.

46:37.228 --> 46:38.228
Lunch, I think.

46:41.299 --> 46:42.299
Aye.

46:46.872 --> 46:49.740
Mr. Drake not allow
you your lunch, then?

46:49.841 --> 46:52.443
Not such a lunch as this.

46:52.543 --> 46:57.883
No, he... he felt... well, he
and Mr. Dove felt we here

46:57.983 --> 47:00.551
who police these streets must
be seen to work as hard as them

47:00.651 --> 47:02.420
who must live on them
and not place ourselves

47:02.520 --> 47:03.321
above them in any way.

47:03.421 --> 47:06.091
But we are above them, son.

47:06.191 --> 47:12.097
They defer to the law,
and we, we are the law.

47:12.197 --> 47:16.134
There is no equality in that
fact, nor ought there to be.

47:16.234 --> 47:17.234
Yeah, yes.

47:17.268 --> 47:19.304
Yes, Inspector.

47:19.404 --> 47:23.508
Now we must ask ourselves why
Mr. Reid would show himself so.

47:23.608 --> 47:28.213
Because aside from the certain
fact he is about as conceited,

47:28.313 --> 47:32.317
a sanctimonious a soul
as ever pissed up a wall,

47:32.417 --> 47:35.120
he is proper police.

47:35.220 --> 47:37.522
He and his American
associate do not

47:37.622 --> 47:40.025
go around letting
off firecrackers

47:40.125 --> 47:41.960
without good reason.

47:42.060 --> 47:45.363
These pit fights, they
have significance for them.

47:45.463 --> 47:49.901
With that being the
case, there's one today.

47:50.001 --> 47:53.671
Might not be the only such
fight they might attend.

47:53.771 --> 47:57.442
My, you are a quick
fellow, detective.

47:57.542 --> 48:00.445
What else does that quick
wit of yours ponder?

48:00.545 --> 48:02.247
Our new friend
Jenkins, who you've

48:02.347 --> 48:03.357
got now strung up in our cells.

48:03.381 --> 48:04.916
Indeed.

48:05.016 --> 48:06.260
He might be setting
the organizing

48:06.284 --> 48:09.220
of another such fight,
the coordinates of which

48:09.320 --> 48:11.489
to be described a little
bit differently to Mr.

48:11.589 --> 48:12.890
Reid and Captain Jackson.

48:12.991 --> 48:15.826
And there, where there was a
fair amount of pit fighting...

48:15.927 --> 48:18.196
There would instead be
ourselves, lying in wait.

48:21.699 --> 48:24.402
Here's a happy thing.

48:24.502 --> 48:28.406
You are a man of foresight?

48:30.641 --> 48:34.145
Jesus, unchain me.
I'm not an evil man.

48:39.985 --> 48:44.922
Were I a dog bred for profit,
would you make such a claim?

48:45.023 --> 48:45.623
I mean, yes.

48:45.723 --> 48:48.159
Yes, I am an evil man.

48:48.259 --> 48:49.460
I am an evil man.

48:49.560 --> 48:51.029
Then do you say I am a dog?

48:53.664 --> 48:58.036
Mr. Shine, my
pardon, 1,000 pardons!

48:58.136 --> 49:00.171
Ought I to release you?

49:00.271 --> 49:02.907
I don't ask, sir.

49:03.008 --> 49:04.976
It's for your sake.

49:05.076 --> 49:07.045
If I were to, would
you do my bidding?

49:11.316 --> 49:12.950
Forever more!

49:13.051 --> 49:14.319
Forever more!

49:14.419 --> 49:16.154
Forever more?

49:16.254 --> 49:19.857
Then, do what you do best,
and by way of example,

49:19.957 --> 49:22.493
see another pit fight
arranged and broadcast.

49:29.600 --> 49:30.600
Take him down.

49:40.078 --> 49:41.078
Sign here.

49:50.221 --> 49:52.123
And you, Frank.

49:52.223 --> 49:54.392
He is meticulous,
our desk sergeant.

49:54.492 --> 49:57.262
Oh, he is that.

49:57.362 --> 50:00.498
And more besides.
Right.

50:03.934 --> 50:05.436
Be on your way now, Mr. Jenkins.

50:08.573 --> 50:10.875
Don't be forgetting our
love for you, Mr. Jenkins.

50:20.618 --> 50:21.618
What.
Drum?

50:35.066 --> 50:36.601
What would you prefer,
Thilda, that you

50:36.701 --> 50:40.371
were caught and returned,
to make his case, I mean?

50:40.471 --> 50:43.374
Claim his innocence or
that you were ever caught?

50:43.474 --> 50:45.976
And never returned?

50:46.077 --> 50:49.114
I cannot say, but I do not think
it only the law which motivates

50:49.214 --> 50:51.316
Mr. Shine's pursuit of him.
- No.

50:51.416 --> 50:53.551
He was right, however.

50:53.651 --> 50:55.453
What he said about resurrection.

50:55.553 --> 50:57.473
Father said it too, that
I was born to him twice.

51:00.325 --> 51:02.160
And now I am perhaps
lost to him twice.

51:09.700 --> 51:11.502
They set a trap for him.

51:11.602 --> 51:14.172
Shine and Frank Thatcher.

51:14.272 --> 51:15.906
Drum, what is it?

51:16.006 --> 51:17.808
Please, will you say?

51:17.908 --> 51:18.908
He is my father.

51:54.679 --> 51:56.314
There.
Your Mormons again.

51:56.414 --> 51:59.284
Captain, find the coordinates
of this next pit fight.

51:59.384 --> 52:00.551
And where is it you go?

52:00.651 --> 52:02.153
To see my girl.

52:02.253 --> 52:04.389
Have you lost your mind?

52:04.489 --> 52:05.156
If you're taken...

52:05.256 --> 52:06.924
Then I am taken.

52:07.024 --> 52:09.760
But she lit a candle for me
last night, so I must go to her.

52:09.860 --> 52:11.362
You go, Mr. Reid.

52:18.035 --> 52:20.137
Do not sling your
accusations at me.

52:20.238 --> 52:22.340
I know how he feels, is all.

52:22.440 --> 52:24.309
So you're go to
Hackney, do you?

52:24.409 --> 52:27.478
I know where our son is.
I must go.

52:38.956 --> 52:40.458
Mathilda, my girl.

52:40.558 --> 52:41.459
You were watching?

52:41.559 --> 52:44.429
I have been every
night I could.

52:44.529 --> 52:45.930
You are well, my darling.

52:46.030 --> 52:47.064
Is there any trouble?

52:47.164 --> 52:48.333
Are you threatened?

52:48.433 --> 52:49.267
No, father.

52:49.367 --> 52:50.735
I am well.

52:50.835 --> 52:53.304
Samuel Drummond
keeps a weather eye.

52:53.404 --> 52:54.839
He stops the night at our home?

52:54.939 --> 52:57.275
He does.

52:57.375 --> 52:59.176
Well, Mathilda,
you lit your candle.

52:59.277 --> 53:02.046
I did.

53:02.146 --> 53:03.146
Father, Mr. Swift.

53:05.983 --> 53:08.018
Yes.

53:08.118 --> 53:10.120
Mathilda, please, we
need space and freedom,

53:10.221 --> 53:11.389
time for such talk.

53:11.489 --> 53:12.990
No, it is not so
much Mr. Swift.

53:13.090 --> 53:18.729
I was just... the cellar, father,
why would you put him there?

53:18.829 --> 53:20.030
Why?

53:20.130 --> 53:22.467
The cellar that
was once my home.

53:22.567 --> 53:23.834
Mathilda, please.

53:23.934 --> 53:28.406
It had the force of logic
and I... we will in due course

53:28.506 --> 53:29.866
talk on it, and I
will explain all,

53:29.940 --> 53:33.678
but for now, please, is there
anything you need to tell me?

53:33.778 --> 53:35.145
They plan for your capture.

53:35.246 --> 53:35.980
This is Mr. Dove.

53:36.080 --> 53:37.848
He plans it?

53:37.948 --> 53:38.816
No, it is not.

53:38.916 --> 53:40.017
Then, who?

53:40.117 --> 53:42.253
There is a new man sits
in Uncle Bennet's office.

53:42.353 --> 53:43.788
He came to talk to me.

53:43.888 --> 53:44.622
What is his name?

53:44.722 --> 53:45.722
He is named Shine.

53:48.926 --> 53:50.761
Are you certain?
Jedediah Shine?

53:54.265 --> 53:55.966
Has he threatened you?
- No, father.

53:56.066 --> 53:57.968
Quite the reverse, in fact.

53:58.068 --> 54:00.104
Never, ever let yourself
be alone with him.

54:00.204 --> 54:02.106
Do you understand?
Do you understand?

54:02.206 --> 54:03.206
Yes, I understand.

54:08.178 --> 54:12.883
Now, what is his strategy?

54:12.983 --> 54:15.052
Mathilda, please.
His strategy.

54:34.305 --> 54:35.940
Peace be with you, brother.

54:36.040 --> 54:37.040
And you.

54:44.682 --> 54:46.150
Gather round, gather round.

54:46.250 --> 54:47.928
All those seeking
employment, the household

54:47.952 --> 54:51.622
has need for a footman,
a cook, and two maids.

54:51.722 --> 54:53.157
All applicants
are to form a line

54:53.257 --> 54:54.617
and hand their
credentials in here.

54:58.796 --> 54:59.796
Footman, is it?

55:20.518 --> 55:22.887
He has a governess.

55:22.987 --> 55:25.490
Well, governesses can be
dissuaded with firearms.

55:25.590 --> 55:27.925
You have not seen this woman.

55:28.025 --> 55:29.436
She has the look of
someone who has sent

55:29.460 --> 55:32.863
Satan himself back to Hell.

55:32.963 --> 55:36.634
Besides, there is
a bodyguard also.

55:36.734 --> 55:38.936
Two uniformed men.

55:39.036 --> 55:43.508
It's Whitechapel
men, H Division?

55:43.608 --> 55:45.876
- No, A.
- It's Westminster.

55:48.679 --> 55:51.181
Even they're not immune to a
bullet shot from a firearm.

55:51.281 --> 55:53.518
I suspect it may come to that.

55:53.618 --> 55:54.985
Well, you took your sweet time.

55:55.085 --> 55:56.397
Any longer, we'd have
missed our window.

55:56.421 --> 55:57.764
There's another pit
fight scheduled.

55:57.788 --> 55:58.989
I know.

55:59.089 --> 56:01.759
It is upon the waste ground
beyond the charcoal works.

56:01.859 --> 56:03.160
What?
How?

56:03.260 --> 56:04.438
I only just came from the man...

56:04.462 --> 56:05.630
Never mind.

56:05.730 --> 56:08.699
But I have found
opportunity also.

56:08.799 --> 56:11.536
They construct this animal
fight to draw us out,

56:11.636 --> 56:14.004
but we shall see their claws
pulled from them first.

56:19.410 --> 56:22.012
DS Thatcher.

56:22.112 --> 56:25.416
My heart has sorely
missed you, son.

56:25.516 --> 56:27.251
As I have it, Sergeant,
you are half in love

56:27.351 --> 56:28.351
with your new inspector.

56:31.622 --> 56:33.624
Sergeant Thatcher, the
unreliable copper,

56:33.724 --> 56:34.859
is he?

56:34.959 --> 56:36.794
Where the hell is he, Drummond?

56:36.894 --> 56:39.630
You men with me.

56:39.730 --> 56:42.500
We must move now, or the
chance trap Reid is...

56:42.600 --> 56:43.968
What's that noise.

56:51.976 --> 56:52.843
Thatcher.

56:52.943 --> 56:54.344
He's always.

56:57.682 --> 56:58.682
Aw, is it chafing?

57:05.990 --> 57:06.990
Lovely bunch of flowers!

57:24.141 --> 57:25.175
You out there, Ed Reid?

57:29.246 --> 57:33.518
I know you too vain a man not to
now be watching your own acts.

57:36.453 --> 57:41.158
I'm fierce glad to be here,
fierce glad to know you yet,

57:41.258 --> 57:43.761
a worthy antagonist!

57:43.861 --> 57:49.734
I have thirsted long
and hard for this fight!

57:53.504 --> 57:59.376
I'm in your house, my
feet under your table.

57:59.476 --> 58:03.047
And I will not be leaving till
I've looked you in the eye.

58:08.719 --> 58:12.222
And then I'm gonna paint
these streets with your blood!

58:15.092 --> 58:22.199
All men, every address within
100 yards, tear 'em apart.

58:22.299 --> 58:23.300
Do it now.

58:23.400 --> 58:24.635
Tear 'em apart!

58:24.735 --> 58:25.870
Tear 'em apart!

58:25.970 --> 58:28.673
I want him found... now!

58:28.773 --> 58:29.840
We'd best run, eh?

58:35.445 --> 58:37.347
- It'll be all right.

58:46.456 --> 58:47.456
Forgive me, Abel.

59:17.454 --> 59:19.824
Don't let 'em get you!

59:19.924 --> 59:20.825
We'll miss you!

59:20.925 --> 59:22.827
Go Mr. Reid!

59:22.927 --> 59:24.328
We won't forget you, Mr. Reid!
