GIRL: <i>Water.</i>

00:03.250 --> 00:05.170
<i>Earth.</i>

00:05.300 --> 00:07.300
<i>Fire.</i>

00:07.430 --> 00:10.010
<i>Air.</i>

00:10.090 --> 00:13.810
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

00:13.930 --> 00:18.520
<i>Then everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

00:18.600 --> 00:22.150
Only the Avatar, master of
all four elements, could stop them.

00:22.320 --> 00:25.990
<i>But when the world
needed him most, he vanished.</i>

00:26.110 --> 00:29.490
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother
and I discovered the new Avatar,</i>

00:29.610 --> 00:31.450
<i>an airbender named Aang.</i>

00:31.530 --> 00:33.790
<i>And although his airbending skills
are great,</i>

00:33.870 --> 00:36.540
<i>he has a lot to learn before he's
ready to save anyone.</i>

00:36.620 --> 00:37.750
AANG: Oof!

00:37.830 --> 00:40.500
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

00:47.010 --> 00:48.680
MAN: <i>Previously on</i> Avatar...

00:48.800 --> 00:51.470
BOY: <i>Fire Nation killed my parents.</i>

00:51.550 --> 00:53.050
I was only eight years old.

00:53.430 --> 00:55.970
Hello, my name is Joo Dee.

00:56.060 --> 00:59.810
We found out about a solar eclipse that
will leave the Fire Nation defenseless.

00:59.890 --> 01:05.070
It is the strict policy of Ba Sing Se that
the war not be mentioned within the walls.

01:07.360 --> 01:09.450
You don't understand, they're Fire Nation!

01:09.570 --> 01:11.860
You have to believe me.

01:11.950 --> 01:14.280
There is no war within the walls.

01:14.370 --> 01:15.950
Here we are safe.

01:16.040 --> 01:18.960
Here we are free.

01:19.040 --> 01:21.830
MAN: <i>I understand you've been</i>
<i>looking for your bison.</i>

01:21.920 --> 01:25.500
<i>It would be quite a shame if you were
not able to complete your quest.</i>

01:46.650 --> 01:50.070
We found a printer to make our posters.

01:50.190 --> 01:53.490
Hey, I thought designing the
"lost Appa" poster was my job.

01:53.570 --> 01:55.370
I've been working all day on my Appa.

01:56.080 --> 01:58.450
- Sokka, the arrow is on Appa's head.
-( LAUGHING )

01:59.200 --> 02:00.620
This is his head.

02:01.620 --> 02:03.630
Why are feet coming out of it?

02:03.710 --> 02:05.500
Those are his horns!

02:05.590 --> 02:07.800
I haven't seen him in a while, O.K.?

02:07.880 --> 02:09.920
It looks just like him to me.

02:10.010 --> 02:12.260
Thank you, I worked really...

02:12.340 --> 02:14.510
Why do you feel the need to do that?

02:14.590 --> 02:17.010
Let's just stick with
the professional version.

02:17.100 --> 02:19.100
( GROWLING )

02:19.180 --> 02:21.230
Come on, let's get busy!

02:38.080 --> 02:41.330
So you're the genius
behind this incredible brew.

02:41.450 --> 02:43.500
The whole city is buzzing about you!

02:43.790 --> 02:45.580
I hope Pao pays you well.

02:45.710 --> 02:48.170
Good tea is its own reward.

02:48.290 --> 02:51.460
But it doesn't have to be the only reward.

02:51.590 --> 02:54.300
How would you like to have
your own tea shop?

02:54.430 --> 02:56.010
My own tea shop?

02:56.140 --> 02:57.720
This is a dream come true.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.350
What's going on here?

03:00.430 --> 03:02.230
Are you trying to poach my tea maker?

03:02.310 --> 03:05.980
Sorry, Pao, but that's business
for you, am I right?

03:06.060 --> 03:10.650
Mushi, if you stay,
I'll make you assistant manager.

03:10.730 --> 03:13.110
Wait, senior assistant manager.

03:13.190 --> 03:16.030
I'll provide you with a new apartment
in the upper ring.

03:16.110 --> 03:20.450
The tea shop is yours to do whatever
you want, complete creative freedom.

03:20.540 --> 03:22.620
I even get to name the shop?

03:22.750 --> 03:24.250
Of course!

03:24.370 --> 03:27.500
Uh, senior executive assistant manager?

03:29.040 --> 03:31.960
Ooh.

03:32.090 --> 03:33.630
Did you hear, Nephew?

03:33.720 --> 03:38.590
This man wants to give us our own tea shop
in the upper ring of the city.

03:38.680 --> 03:40.140
That's right, young man.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.350
Your life is about to
change for the better.

03:43.430 --> 03:45.810
NEPHEW: I'll try to contain my joy.

04:16.840 --> 04:18.840
I just finished dropping all the leaflets.

04:18.930 --> 04:20.970
Has anyone come in with news about Appa?

04:21.050 --> 04:23.680
It's only been a day, just be patient.

04:25.180 --> 04:26.640
( KNOCKING )

04:26.730 --> 04:27.940
Wow, you're right!

04:28.020 --> 04:29.810
Patience really pays off.

04:31.650 --> 04:32.650
Joo Dee?

04:32.770 --> 04:37.240
Hello, Aang and Katara and Sokka and Toph.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.490
What happened to you?

04:38.610 --> 04:40.200
Did the Dai Li throw you in jail?

04:40.280 --> 04:42.370
What, jail?

04:42.450 --> 04:43.870
Of course not.

04:43.950 --> 04:47.540
The Dai Li are the protectors
of our cultural heritage.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.790
But you disappeared
at the Earth King's party.

04:49.870 --> 04:54.550
Oh, I simply took a short vacation to
Lake Laogai, out in the country.

04:54.670 --> 04:56.880
It was quite relaxing.

04:57.010 --> 05:01.300
But then they replaced you with some other
woman who also said her name was Joo Dee.

05:01.390 --> 05:02.760
I'm Joo Dee.

05:02.850 --> 05:04.310
Why are you here?

05:04.390 --> 05:08.430
Dropping flyers and putting up posters
isn't permitted within the city.

05:08.520 --> 05:10.020
Not without proper clearance.

05:10.100 --> 05:12.900
We can't wait around to get
permission for everything.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.860
You are absolutely forbidden
by the rules of the city

05:15.940 --> 05:17.990
to continue putting up posters.

05:19.240 --> 05:22.490
We don't care about the rules
and we're not asking permission!

05:22.620 --> 05:26.700
We're finding Appa on our own and you
should just stay out of our way!

05:26.830 --> 05:29.250
That might come back
to bite us in the blubber.

05:29.330 --> 05:30.500
I don't care.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.920
From now on, we do
whatever it takes to find Appa.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.380
Yeah, let's break some rules!

05:48.140 --> 05:51.980
I'm very disappointed in your work with
the Avatar and his friends, Joo Dee.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.940
I had hoped that you would be
able to control this situation.

05:55.020 --> 05:58.480
I'm so sorry,
but they don't trust me anymore.

05:58.610 --> 06:01.610
I don't think
I can keep working like this.

06:01.700 --> 06:05.990
Joo Dee, the Earth King has
invited you to Lake Laogai.

06:08.830 --> 06:11.620
JOO DEE: I am honored
to accept his invitation.

06:13.330 --> 06:14.630
Good.

06:14.710 --> 06:17.920
Now go await further orders.

06:21.220 --> 06:23.510
If the Avatar keeps searching
for his bison,

06:23.590 --> 06:27.430
it could upset the delicate balance we've
worked so hard to achieve in this city.

06:27.510 --> 06:29.770
It could even cost us control of
the Earth King.

06:29.970 --> 06:31.680
Should we take care of him?

06:31.810 --> 06:35.770
No, it's much too dangerous for
us to confront him directly.

06:35.860 --> 06:39.860
Let's see if we can still handle
this... Quietly.

06:45.200 --> 06:48.780
So I was thinking about names
for my new tea shop.

06:48.910 --> 06:51.750
How 'bout the Jasmine Dragon?

06:51.870 --> 06:55.750
It's dramatic, poetic,
has a nice ring to it.

06:56.130 --> 06:58.380
The Avatar's here in Ba Sing Se.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.500
And he's lost his bison.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.880
We have a chance for a new life here.

07:05.010 --> 07:06.890
If you start stirring up trouble,

07:06.970 --> 07:10.390
we could lose all the good things that
are happening for us.

07:10.640 --> 07:12.680
Good things that are happening for you.

07:12.770 --> 07:15.020
Have you ever thought that I want
more from life

07:15.100 --> 07:17.400
than a nice apartment
and a job serving tea?

07:17.480 --> 07:21.150
There is nothing wrong with
a life of peace and prosperity.

07:21.230 --> 07:27.320
I suggest you think about what it is
that you want from your life, and why.

07:27.410 --> 07:29.160
I want my destiny.

07:29.240 --> 07:33.200
What that means is up to you.

07:33.330 --> 07:35.330
The Tea Weevil!

07:35.410 --> 07:36.870
No, that's stupid.

07:40.840 --> 07:42.880
We'll split up to cover more area.

07:42.960 --> 07:44.970
Toph, I guess you should
just come with me.

07:45.050 --> 07:48.840
Why, because you think I can't
put up posters on my own?

07:52.350 --> 07:54.770
TOPH: It's upside-down, isn't it?

07:54.850 --> 07:57.980
I'll just go with Sokka.

08:05.700 --> 08:07.570
VOICE: Katara?

08:07.820 --> 08:09.450
( GASPING )

08:09.530 --> 08:11.700
I think I can help you.

08:14.250 --> 08:15.410
( SCREAMING )

08:15.500 --> 08:17.420
Katara, I've changed!

08:19.170 --> 08:20.290
( SCREAMING )

08:22.090 --> 08:24.460
Tell it to some other girl, Jet.

08:24.590 --> 08:25.720
( GROWLING )

08:25.840 --> 08:30.220
( GRUNTING )

08:30.340 --> 08:33.100
I don't want to fight you,
I'm here to help.

08:39.270 --> 08:40.980
( GRUNTING )

08:45.360 --> 08:47.990
SOKKA: Katara, what is it?

08:48.070 --> 08:50.570
Jet's back.

08:55.450 --> 08:57.580
We can't trust anything Jet says.

08:57.660 --> 08:59.460
But we don't even know why he's here.

08:59.540 --> 09:00.880
I don't care why he's here.

09:00.960 --> 09:03.090
Whatever the reason is, it can't be good.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.920
I'm here to help you find Appa.

09:08.420 --> 09:10.550
Katara, we have to give him a chance.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.600
I swear, I've changed.

09:12.720 --> 09:15.810
I was a troubled person,
and I let my anger get out of control.

09:15.890 --> 09:17.680
But I don't even have the gang, now.

09:17.770 --> 09:19.350
I've put all that behind me.

09:19.440 --> 09:20.440
You're lying.

09:23.400 --> 09:24.860
He's not lying.

09:24.940 --> 09:26.110
SOKKA: How can you tell?

09:26.190 --> 09:28.360
TOPH: I can feel his breathing
and heartbeat.

09:28.440 --> 09:31.070
When people lie,
there's a physical reaction.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.370
He's telling the truth.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.450
Katara, we don't have any leads.

09:35.580 --> 09:39.790
If Jet says he can take us to
Appa, we have to check it out.

09:39.870 --> 09:41.500
All right.

09:41.580 --> 09:44.420
But we're not letting you
out of our sight.

09:45.420 --> 09:48.260
This is the place I heard about.

09:49.300 --> 09:50.590
AANG: There's nothing here.

09:51.220 --> 09:52.260
If this is a trap...

09:52.340 --> 09:54.350
I told you, I work nearby.

09:54.430 --> 09:57.390
Two guys were talkin' about some
giant furry creature they had.

09:57.470 --> 09:58.930
I figured it must be Appa.

09:59.020 --> 10:00.430
TOPH: He was here!

10:05.360 --> 10:06.820
We missed him.

10:06.940 --> 10:10.030
They took that big thing yesterday.

10:10.150 --> 10:11.650
Shipped him out to some island.

10:11.740 --> 10:13.280
About time.

10:13.360 --> 10:18.240
I been cleaning up fur and
various, uh, leavings all day.

10:18.370 --> 10:20.540
What island? Where's Appa?

10:20.660 --> 10:26.380
Foreman said some rich royal type on
Whaletail Island bought him up,

10:26.500 --> 10:30.420
guess for a zoo or such, though
could be the meat'd be good.

10:31.260 --> 10:34.010
We've gotta get to Whaletail Island.

10:34.140 --> 10:35.850
Where's Whaletail Island?

10:36.260 --> 10:37.260
SOKKA: Far.

10:37.390 --> 10:38.720
Very far.

10:39.310 --> 10:40.600
Here it is.

10:40.680 --> 10:43.270
It's near the south pole,
almost all the way back home.

10:43.350 --> 10:46.650
Aang, it'll take us weeks just to get to
the tip of the Earth Kingdom.

10:46.730 --> 10:49.360
And then we'll need to find
a boat to get to the island.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.990
I don't care, we have a chance to find
Appa, we have to try.

10:53.110 --> 10:55.700
JANITOR: Must be nice to visit an island.

10:55.820 --> 10:58.620
I haven't had a vacation for years.

10:58.740 --> 11:01.000
Don't you have some more hair to clean up?

11:01.120 --> 11:03.080
Shuffle on, I get ya.

11:03.210 --> 11:05.880
No more need for Old Sweepy.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.170
You're right, Aang.

11:07.290 --> 11:09.750
Right now, our first concern
has to be finding Appa.

11:09.880 --> 11:11.590
We can come back when we have him.

11:11.670 --> 11:13.050
All right, let's get moving.

11:13.220 --> 11:14.550
I'll come with you.

11:14.630 --> 11:15.840
We don't need your help.

11:16.180 --> 11:18.050
Why won't you trust me?

11:19.470 --> 11:21.180
Gee, I wonder.

11:21.310 --> 11:23.980
Was this guy your boyfriend or something?

11:24.100 --> 11:26.100
What, no!

11:26.190 --> 11:29.440
I can tell you're lying.

11:30.610 --> 11:34.110
SOKKA: We can take the train out to
the wall, but then we'll have to walk.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.570
Don't worry, on the way back,
we'll be flying.

11:36.660 --> 11:39.580
We're finally leaving Ba Sing Se.

11:39.660 --> 11:42.450
Worst city ever!

11:43.370 --> 11:44.500
Jet!

11:44.870 --> 11:47.370
I thought you said you didn't
have your gang anymore.

11:47.460 --> 11:48.500
I don't.

11:48.580 --> 11:49.630
We were so worried.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.670
How did you get away from the Dai Li?

11:51.750 --> 11:52.840
The Dai Li?

11:52.920 --> 11:54.760
I don't know what she's talking about.

11:54.840 --> 11:57.510
He got arrested by the Dai Li
a couple weeks ago.

11:57.590 --> 11:59.140
We saw them drag him away.

11:59.220 --> 12:00.720
Why would I be arrested?

12:00.800 --> 12:02.720
I've been living peacefully in the city.

12:02.810 --> 12:04.810
This doesn't make any sense.

12:04.930 --> 12:06.980
They're <i>both</i> telling the truth.

12:07.100 --> 12:08.230
That's impossible.

12:08.350 --> 12:09.940
No, it's not.

12:10.020 --> 12:13.690
Toph can't tell who's lying because
they both think they're telling the truth.

12:13.780 --> 12:15.190
Jet's been brainwashed.

12:15.320 --> 12:16.530
That's crazy!

12:16.650 --> 12:18.910
It can't be.

12:19.030 --> 12:20.030
Stay away from me!

12:27.870 --> 12:31.290
( BELL RINGING )

12:37.090 --> 12:38.380
BOY: Out of my way, skinny.

12:38.510 --> 12:40.640
Ugh.

12:59.660 --> 13:00.780
Huh? ( GASPING )

13:00.910 --> 13:02.910
BOY: If you don't want to end up like him,

13:02.990 --> 13:04.160
you'll do what I say.

13:04.910 --> 13:06.790
( PURRING )

13:06.870 --> 13:08.960
The Dai Li must have sent Jet to
mislead us,

13:09.040 --> 13:11.290
and that janitor was part of their plot,
too.

13:11.380 --> 13:13.210
I bet they have Appa here in the city.

13:13.340 --> 13:15.380
Maybe he's in the same place
they took Jet.

13:15.500 --> 13:16.670
Where did they take you?

13:16.800 --> 13:19.930
Nowhere. I, I don't know
what you're talking about.

13:20.050 --> 13:22.550
We need to find a way
to jog his real memories.

13:23.010 --> 13:24.510
Maybe Katara could kiss him.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.180
That should bring something back.

13:26.270 --> 13:28.230
Maybe you should kiss him, Sokka.

13:28.350 --> 13:30.190
Hey, just an idea.

13:30.270 --> 13:31.480
A bad one.

13:32.810 --> 13:34.610
Ooh, wait, I got it.

13:39.110 --> 13:41.450
I don't think it's working. Puh!

13:41.570 --> 13:45.370
TOPH: Try to think of something from your
past that triggers your emotions.

13:45.490 --> 13:48.870
SMELLERBEE: The Fire Nation, remember what
they did to your family?

13:48.950 --> 13:50.580
Close your eyes.

13:50.660 --> 13:51.960
Picture it.

13:54.080 --> 13:55.130
( SCREAMING )

14:03.470 --> 14:05.010
No!

14:05.140 --> 14:06.220
It's too painful.

14:07.350 --> 14:09.060
Maybe this'll help.

14:32.370 --> 14:36.090
They took me to a headquarters
under the water, like a lake.

14:36.210 --> 14:38.380
Wait, remember what Joo Dee said?

14:38.500 --> 14:41.010
She said she went on vacation
to Lake Laogai.

14:41.090 --> 14:42.260
That's it!

14:42.380 --> 14:43.880
Lake Laogai.

14:53.600 --> 14:55.650
SOKKA: So where's this
secret headquarters?

14:55.730 --> 14:57.650
Under the water, I think.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.070
There's a tunnel right there,
near the shore.

15:00.150 --> 15:01.530
( WHISTLING )

15:13.750 --> 15:14.750
( PURRING )

15:25.090 --> 15:28.100
It's all starting to come back to me.

15:30.760 --> 15:32.020
MAN: "I'm Joo Dee."

15:32.140 --> 15:33.980
"Welcome to Ba Sing Se."

15:34.100 --> 15:36.060
I'm Joo Dee.

15:36.190 --> 15:38.270
Welcome to Ba Sing Se.

15:38.360 --> 15:41.860
"We're so lucky to have
our walls to create order."

15:41.940 --> 15:44.900
We're so lucky to have
our walls to create order.

15:44.990 --> 15:48.200
I think there might be a cell big enough
to hold Appa up ahead.

15:49.660 --> 15:51.620
I think it's through here.

15:56.580 --> 16:00.040
Expecting someone else?

16:00.130 --> 16:04.010
( GROWLING )

16:10.930 --> 16:12.760
( GASPING )

16:15.480 --> 16:17.020
Now that's somethin' different.

16:17.140 --> 16:19.980
You have made yourselves
enemies of the state.

16:20.770 --> 16:24.070
Take them into custody.

16:33.660 --> 16:34.660
( GROWLING )

( GRUNTING )

16:45.840 --> 16:46.840
Ah!

17:02.730 --> 17:04.820
Augh!

17:16.290 --> 17:18.790
Long Feng is escaping!

17:28.840 --> 17:30.050
All right, Avatar.

17:30.130 --> 17:31.760
You've caused me enough problems.

17:31.840 --> 17:33.550
This is your last chance.

17:33.640 --> 17:35.720
If you want your bison back.

17:36.350 --> 17:37.640
You <i>do</i> have Appa.

17:37.720 --> 17:38.980
Tell me where he is!

17:39.060 --> 17:41.060
Agree to exit the city now,

17:41.140 --> 17:45.900
and I'll waive all charges against you
and allow you to leave with your lost pet.

17:45.980 --> 17:47.730
You're in no position to bargain.

17:47.820 --> 17:49.190
Am I not?

17:49.400 --> 17:51.150
You're definitely not.

17:51.240 --> 17:55.240
Jet, the Earth King has
invited you to Lake Laogai.

17:56.740 --> 17:59.160
JET: I am honored to accept
his invitation.

18:00.040 --> 18:01.580

18:03.170 --> 18:04.330
( SCREAMING )

18:04.420 --> 18:07.000
( GROWLING )

18:09.210 --> 18:12.180
You're mine, now.

18:15.220 --> 18:16.260
Uncle?

18:16.390 --> 18:19.100
So, the Blue Spirit.

18:19.220 --> 18:22.480
I wonder who could be behind that mask.

18:22.600 --> 18:24.350
( SIGHING ) What are you doing here?

18:24.480 --> 18:28.030
I was just about to ask you
the same thing.

18:28.150 --> 18:32.610
What do you plan to do now that
you've found the Avatar's bison?

18:32.740 --> 18:34.740
Keep it locked in our new apartment?

18:34.870 --> 18:37.240
Should I go put on a pot of tea for him?

18:37.370 --> 18:39.450
First I have to get it out of here.

18:39.580 --> 18:41.080
( SHOUTING ) And then what?

18:41.200 --> 18:43.540
You never think these things through.

18:43.670 --> 18:48.460
This is exactly what happened when you
captured the Avatar at the North Pole.

18:48.590 --> 18:51.550
You had him,
and then you had nowhere to go!

18:51.670 --> 18:53.590
I would've figured something out.

18:53.680 --> 18:54.680
No!

18:54.800 --> 18:58.470
If his friends hadn't found you,
you would have frozen to death!

18:58.640 --> 19:00.970
( GROWLING ) I know my own destiny, Uncle.

19:01.060 --> 19:03.060
Is it your own destiny?

19:03.190 --> 19:06.860
Or is it a destiny someone else
has tried to force on you?

19:07.440 --> 19:09.900
Stop it, uncle. I have to do this.

19:10.030 --> 19:12.820
I'm begging you, Prince Zuko!

19:12.900 --> 19:19.530
It's time for you to look inward and begin
asking yourself the big questions.

19:19.660 --> 19:22.500
Who are you, and what do you want?

19:23.460 --> 19:24.750

Jet, it's me, Aang!

19:34.170 --> 19:35.930
You don't have to do this.

19:36.010 --> 19:38.260
I'm afraid he no longer has a choice.

19:38.640 --> 19:40.390
JET: ( BREATHING HEAVILY )

19:40.510 --> 19:44.640
Ah, ah, ah!

19:45.560 --> 19:48.860
( GROWLING )

19:48.940 --> 19:50.860
Jet, I'm your friend.

19:50.940 --> 19:53.190
Look inside your heart.

19:53.320 --> 19:55.070
Do your duty, Jet.

19:57.820 --> 19:59.620
He can't make you do this!

19:59.700 --> 20:01.660
You're a freedom fighter.

Foolish boy.

20:33.900 --> 20:37.610
You've chosen your own demise.

20:39.530 --> 20:40.740
I'm sorry, Aang.

20:40.870 --> 20:42.910
Don't be.

20:56.920 --> 20:58.260
This isn't good.

20:58.380 --> 21:01.430
You guys go and find Appa,
we'll take care of Jet.

21:01.550 --> 21:03.050
We're not gonna leave you.

21:03.180 --> 21:05.520
There's no time. Just go.

21:05.600 --> 21:06.810
We'll take care of him.

21:06.930 --> 21:09.100
He's our leader.

21:09.230 --> 21:10.810
Don't worry, Katara.

21:10.940 --> 21:12.310
I'll be fine.

21:19.360 --> 21:20.530
He's lying.

21:32.830 --> 21:34.800
AANG: Appa's gone!

21:34.920 --> 21:36.090
Long Feng beat us here.

21:36.210 --> 21:40.840
If we keep moving, maybe we can
catch up with them.

21:53.860 --> 21:55.690
You think we could outrun them?
