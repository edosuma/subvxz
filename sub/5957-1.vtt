02:54.272 --> 02:56.399
- Good morning.

02:56.474 --> 02:59.068
It´s 8:00 in wonderful Coombs County,
where once again...

02:59.177 --> 03:01.702
state police have refused to confirm or deny...

03:01.746 --> 03:05.409
more of those mysterious ´´lights in
the sky´´ sightings by local residents.

03:05.450 --> 03:09.409
Roving air reporters spoke with Miss
Josie Floss, who made such a sighting.

03:09.454 --> 03:12.719
I seen that sightin´ with my own eyes.

03:12.824 --> 03:15.418
And when I called the police,
they told me it was swamp gas.

03:17.028 --> 03:20.429
- Bullshit! Ain´t no swamps in Coombs County!

03:20.465 --> 03:25.425
- Gonna be a sparklin´ day.

03:25.537 --> 03:27.562
Sparklin´.

03:27.639 --> 03:31.837
Makes me crazy! Clara!

03:31.876 --> 03:33.639
Clara!

03:33.745 --> 03:37.579
My electric´s gone out again, Clara!
I'm gonna miss my soaps!

03:37.649 --> 03:39.617
- Oh, stop your yakkin´.
- Bill?

03:39.651 --> 03:43.451
Bill, Elvira´s blacked out again! Pass the word.

03:43.488 --> 03:46.252
- Have a nice day, honey.
- Thanks, Mrs. Boone. You too.

03:46.357 --> 03:48.655
Elvira´s got no electric.

03:48.760 --> 03:51.786
She can´t see her soaps, she´ll hyperventilate.

03:51.863 --> 03:53.956
Great day for a picnic, Maggie!

03:53.998 --> 03:56.865
- Can´t wait, Mr. Boone. Catch yourself a big one!
- If I can!

03:56.901 --> 03:59.768
Granny, I fixed you lunch
and put it in the fridge.

03:59.871 --> 04:01.736
- Have fun, child.
- Sure you´re gonna be okay?

04:01.806 --> 04:06.743
I'll be fine, dear. Now you just run along. Bye!

04:10.548 --> 04:12.709
- Hi, Mrs. Rogan.
- Hi, Maggie.

04:12.817 --> 04:15.012
- Did you find that picnic basket yet?
- Mmm-huh.

04:15.053 --> 04:18.284
- It´s in the living room.
- Oh, thanks. Where´s Alex?

04:18.322 --> 04:21.224
- Where else?
- Right.

04:21.326 --> 04:23.658
- Louis.

04:26.531 --> 04:29.329
- Good morning, space-son Louis.
- Earthling.

04:29.434 --> 04:32.631
- Louis!
- Yoohoo, Jane!

04:32.737 --> 04:37.640
Elvira´s electric is out again, and she´s
gonna get hyper if she can´t see her soaps!

04:37.742 --> 04:39.642
- Bleep.

04:39.744 --> 04:44.772
Granny, tell Elvira that Alex´ll be over to
patch her electric in time for the soaps.

04:44.883 --> 04:46.851
I'll tell her, Jane.
Elvira!

04:46.885 --> 04:50.548
- Louis! Louis!
- Bleep-bleep.

04:50.588 --> 04:54.354
- Go tell Alex I need him.
- Beware, aliens. Louis Rogan...

04:54.392 --> 04:58.556
the cosmic cadet,
the space avenger, is on your case.

05:01.699 --> 05:03.599
Greetings, Starfighter!

05:03.635 --> 05:08.504
You have been recruited by the Star League
to defend the frontier against Xur...

05:08.606 --> 05:10.540
and the Kodan Armada.

05:10.608 --> 05:14.601
- Get ready. Prepare for blastoff!

05:16.915 --> 05:18.746
Okay. Let´s go.

05:18.850 --> 05:20.841
Prepare for target light practice, Starfighter.

05:23.221 --> 05:27.715
- Mom´s lookin´ for you, Alex.
- Uh-huh.

05:32.230 --> 05:35.563
- Right there! Right there!

05:38.436 --> 05:40.370
Aim.

05:40.438 --> 05:42.668
They´re onto the center.
Shoot ´em, okay?

05:42.740 --> 05:46.369
Now from the bottom up, okay.
There´s one right over there.

05:46.444 --> 05:48.537
Okay, doin´ good.
Right up there.

05:48.646 --> 05:51.046

06:02.327 --> 06:04.818
Come on, Alex.
They´re here!

06:04.896 --> 06:07.228
- Maggie, queen of the trailer park!

06:09.000 --> 06:11.525
Well... Starfighter Alex
Rogan requests permission...

06:11.603 --> 06:14.197
to turn the bridge over
to my little brother, Louis, sir!

06:14.239 --> 06:19.108
- Um... Okay, you dorks are dead.

06:19.210 --> 06:22.907
You are defeated. Twenty-five cents more, please
- Oh, crapola.

06:22.947 --> 06:25.438
- Rogan, Come on.
- Hey, Alex, how you doin´, man?

06:25.516 --> 06:27.609

06:27.652 --> 06:30.849
- What are you doin´?
- Come on, Alex. Hurry up!

06:33.324 --> 06:37.454
- Alex, did it come yet?
- Uh, no. I don´t think so.

06:37.562 --> 06:39.962
What´s it this time, Rogan?
You joinin´ the Foreign Legion?

06:40.031 --> 06:43.125
Yes, sir, folks. Step right up.
Meet boy adventurer Alex Rogan...

06:43.234 --> 06:46.635
on the last leg of his worldwide tour... to nowhere.

06:48.373 --> 06:50.364
Funny, Blake.

06:50.441 --> 06:53.239
You guys think I'm gonna hang out here,
watch you shine your pickup...

06:53.344 --> 06:57.178
go to the drive-in, get drunk
and throw up every Saturday night...

06:57.248 --> 07:00.342
go to City College like everybody else?

07:00.385 --> 07:02.285
Forget it, man.
I'm doin´ somethin´ with my life.

07:02.320 --> 07:05.380
- Oh-ho. Mr. Serioso.
- Alex!

07:05.490 --> 07:10.257
- Yeah?
- Honey, Elvira´s electric is out.

07:10.295 --> 07:14.288
Oh, Ma, that´s gonna take all day.
I was goin´ to Silver Lake.

07:14.332 --> 07:17.790
Honey, I know. I'm sorry.
I'm working lunch and dinner.

07:17.902 --> 07:20.302
I'm gonna be in town all day!

07:22.607 --> 07:25.007
Oh... All right.
Okay, Ma. I'll do it.

07:25.043 --> 07:27.011
- Thanks, honey.

07:29.247 --> 07:32.011
We´re gonna be late.

07:34.218 --> 07:38.348
- Look. You, uh... You´d just better go ahead
without me. - No. Alex, I'll stay.

07:38.423 --> 07:40.823
- No. That´s okay. This´ll take a while.

07:40.858 --> 07:43.224
Uh... I'll catch up
with you later.

07:43.328 --> 07:46.320
- Alex...

07:49.834 --> 07:54.635
- [Man] Bye-bye, Rogan! See you, dude!

07:59.043 --> 08:02.843
Alex, come help me!

08:02.880 --> 08:06.372
Hey, Alex. Could you give me a hand here?

08:09.087 --> 08:12.181
Thanks, Alex!

08:31.109 --> 08:33.907
What should we do tonight?

08:33.977 --> 08:38.039
- I don´t know.
- How about cards?

08:38.116 --> 08:42.917
- Hey, that´s a good idea.
- But we played cards last night.

08:42.953 --> 08:48.017
Well... The missus wants to go into
town tonight and go dancing.

09:18.923 --> 09:22.984
The fish were really bitin´
down there at the stream.

09:23.094 --> 09:26.427
It was pleasant fishin´ today.

09:26.531 --> 09:31.230
Yup. It´s gonna be pleasant tomorrow too.

09:31.302 --> 09:35.500
Gonna be a pleasant summer
accordin´ to Farmer´s Almanac.

09:35.606 --> 09:40.839
Yeah. I love the Farmer´s
Almanac. I've been readin´ it for years.

09:40.912 --> 09:42.903
Greetings, Starfighter.

09:43.014 --> 09:45.505
You have been recruited by the Star League...

09:45.616 --> 09:49.108
to defend the frontier against
Xur and the Kodan Armada.

09:49.153 --> 09:51.212
- Yeah. Yeah.

09:51.322 --> 09:53.950
- Get ready. Prepare for blastoff.

09:58.329 --> 10:01.628
- Prepare for target light practice, Starfighter.

10:11.943 --> 10:14.639
- Oh, hi, Alex.
- Hey, Otis.

10:18.749 --> 10:20.944
Where´s your Maggie?

10:21.052 --> 10:23.543
Good question.

10:23.654 --> 10:25.679
Out having a good time, I guess.

10:25.756 --> 10:30.386
Oh. And you never have a good time. Is that it?

10:30.495 --> 10:33.555
Oh, sure. I love patching 30-year-old fuse panels...

10:33.664 --> 10:36.565
and plunging people´s toilets.

10:36.667 --> 10:39.363
Otis, l-I never even get a chance
to have a good time around here.

10:41.272 --> 10:45.208
Things change.
Always do.

10:48.179 --> 10:50.170
You´ll get your chance!

10:50.214 --> 10:52.614
Important thing is, when it comes...

10:52.683 --> 10:56.915
You gotta grab it with both hands and hold on tight

11:00.992 --> 11:03.927
Enemy squadrons in Sector 367 closing fast.

11:12.837 --> 11:14.964
- Thanks, Jack.
- You´re welcome.

11:15.039 --> 11:17.132
- Good night, Maggie.
- Good night.

11:50.107 --> 11:52.575
Thought you were gonna meet me at the lake.

11:52.677 --> 11:54.577
What happened?

11:54.679 --> 11:57.204
Same thing that always happens:
I couldn´t get away.

11:59.884 --> 12:02.148
Where´s everybody else?

12:02.253 --> 12:04.244
Oh, they went to a movie.

12:05.656 --> 12:09.092
Old Jack Blake just happened
to be going your way, huh?

12:09.126 --> 12:12.527
Enemy squadron in Sector 3.

12:12.630 --> 12:17.465
- He said it was on his way.
- Blake lives on the other side of town.

12:17.568 --> 12:22.471
Come on, Alex. I wanted to get back to you.

12:24.375 --> 12:27.037
Okay?

12:32.149 --> 12:35.744
Good show, Starfighter! Way to go.

12:35.853 --> 12:39.653
- Alex, look!
- Oh, my God. What is that?

12:39.690 --> 12:41.851
900,000!

12:46.397 --> 12:51.664
900,000!
You gonna bust the record!

12:53.304 --> 12:58.003
Hey! Hey!
Listen up, everybody!

12:58.075 --> 13:00.373
Alex is going for the record!

13:01.679 --> 13:04.705
- Record?
- Take... Take a hand.

13:04.749 --> 13:07.513
Got ´em!
Oh, come and get that one!

13:11.022 --> 13:13.923
You can do it!

13:17.528 --> 13:20.497
Otis, what are you
yelling about? What´s wrong?

13:20.531 --> 13:24.467
Come on! C-Come on!
He´s going to bust the record!

13:24.535 --> 13:27.436
- Hurry! Hurry!

13:27.538 --> 13:30.029
Everyone get back!
Don´t crowd him!

13:30.074 --> 13:32.338
I said, get back!

13:40.251 --> 13:44.278
- Alex, you never got this far before!
- Go, Alex!

13:49.460 --> 13:52.452
Good boy!

13:52.563 --> 13:55.999
Kodan command ship entering kill zone.

13:56.067 --> 13:58.467
- Command ship!
- Oh, command ship!

13:58.569 --> 14:02.005
- What´s a command ship?
- You can do it, Alex! You can do it!

14:07.345 --> 14:10.644
One more now. Come on! That´s the one!
That´s the one we want!

14:20.858 --> 14:24.624
- Yeah! Yeah!

14:54.992 --> 14:58.689
- Good night. Way to go, Alex!
- ´Night, kids.

14:58.796 --> 15:02.061
Alex, you´re something else.
You´re wonderful, boy.

15:02.099 --> 15:05.694
- Thank you.
- If I said it once, I said it a thousand times.

15:05.803 --> 15:09.534
- That boy´s gonna go places.
- That´s one smart boy.

15:23.521 --> 15:25.421
´Night, Alex.

15:27.324 --> 15:29.724
´´´Night, Alex´´?
Wait a second.

15:29.827 --> 15:32.762
Maggie? Maggie?

15:33.864 --> 15:37.129
Hold on a second.
Where are you going?

15:40.938 --> 15:44.135
What´s wrong?

15:44.241 --> 15:47.972
Well, I guess it just hit me.

15:48.045 --> 15:50.479
You really are leaving here, aren´t you?

15:50.548 --> 15:52.573
Of course, I'm leaving.
We´re both gonna leave here.

15:52.683 --> 15:55.049
- Both of us, Alex?
- Yeah.

15:55.152 --> 15:57.245
We-We-We talked about this.

15:57.288 --> 16:00.018
When I get to school, I'm gonna find
a place, and I'm gonna come and get you.

16:00.057 --> 16:03.788
- Well, what about Granny?
- Granny?

16:06.497 --> 16:08.590
Truth is you´re scared of leaving this trailer park.

16:08.699 --> 16:11.293
I'm not scared of leaving
this trailer park, Alex.

16:11.335 --> 16:13.803
Hey. Listen.

16:15.940 --> 16:19.899
Whatever happens, it´s you and me forever, right?

16:21.245 --> 16:23.406
Right?

16:25.316 --> 16:29.343
- I love you so much, Alex.
- I'll always love you, Maggs.

16:33.457 --> 16:36.119
Diarrhea.

16:51.041 --> 16:54.943
Maggie! Maggie!

16:54.979 --> 16:58.642
Alex, I got to go in.
´Night.

16:58.682 --> 17:00.673
- ´Night.
- ´Night.

17:18.135 --> 17:22.401
Someday they´re gonna say,
´´This is where it all began. ´´

17:24.008 --> 17:27.603
- What?
- Mom, I finally broke the Starfighter record.

17:27.711 --> 17:32.944
- Oh, that´s nice, dear.
- Nice? It´s stupendous!

17:33.017 --> 17:35.577
Uh, Alex...

17:35.619 --> 17:38.611
Mr. Brenner knew that you´d want
to see this as soon as possible...

17:38.656 --> 17:40.920
so he brought it by the diner and, uh...

17:40.958 --> 17:43.927
Well, I was so excited, l-I opened it.

17:43.961 --> 17:47.419
- Oh, that´s okay. What is it?
- It´s about your loan.

17:53.637 --> 17:58.438
You can... still go to City College
with your friends.

18:37.414 --> 18:39.348
Greetings, Starfighter.

18:43.854 --> 18:47.813
Greetings, Starfighter. You have been recruited
by the Star League to defend the frontier.

18:47.858 --> 18:50.520
- You have been recruited...
Greetings, Starfighter.

18:50.561 --> 18:52.825
You have been recruited...

18:52.863 --> 18:55.354
You have been recruited...

18:55.432 --> 18:57.457
You have been recruited...

19:00.037 --> 19:04.269
Get ready.
Prepare for blastoff.

19:46.617 --> 19:49.415
Hello. Excuse me, son.

19:51.121 --> 19:54.557
- Store´s closed, mister.
I'm not here for cigarettes or bubble gum, my boy

19:54.625 --> 19:58.254
Can you tell me the name of the person who broke
the record on that game over there?

19:58.362 --> 20:00.330
Where I might find him?

20:01.765 --> 20:05.166
Alex Rogan.
You´re lookin´ at him.

20:05.235 --> 20:08.864
Alex Rogan. Aha-ha.

20:08.939 --> 20:10.873
- Who are you?
- Centauri´s the name.

20:10.974 --> 20:14.808
- I invented Starfighter, which is why I'm here.
- It is?

20:14.845 --> 20:18.144
It is. We have to talk about a matter of
utmost importance. Step into my office.

20:19.483 --> 20:22.543
That´s it.
Come on now.

20:22.653 --> 20:25.645
Nothing to be afraid of.

20:29.093 --> 20:32.756
Oh, yes. Say hello to my assistant, Beta.

20:32.863 --> 20:35.764
- Howdy.

20:35.866 --> 20:40.803
- Ow!
- I must congratulate you on
your virtuoso performance.

20:40.871 --> 20:43.669
Centauri is impressed.
I've seen ´em come and I've seen ´em go.

20:43.774 --> 20:45.799
But you´re the best, my boy.
Dazzling.

20:45.876 --> 20:48.470
Light years ahead of the competition.

20:48.579 --> 20:50.479
Which is why Centauri is here.

20:50.581 --> 20:54.574
He´s got a little proposition for you.
Are ya interested?

20:56.520 --> 20:58.488
- I guess.

20:58.589 --> 21:02.855
- Hey!

21:06.330 --> 21:11.233
- What are you doing?
- Listen. Centauri wants to keep it for a surprise.

21:11.335 --> 21:15.135
Trust me. Oh, ho-ho-ho,
you´re gonna love it. Love it!

21:20.043 --> 21:24.742
The amusing thing about this: It´s all a big mistake.

21:24.848 --> 21:27.783
That particular Starfighter game was
supposed to be delivered to Vegas...

21:27.885 --> 21:32.345
not some flea-speck trailer park in the
middle of tumbleweeds and tarantulas.

21:32.456 --> 21:34.447
So it must be fate, destiny...

21:34.558 --> 21:37.891
blind chance, luck even, that brings us together.

21:37.961 --> 21:41.453
And as the poet says, ´´The rest is history. ´´

21:50.674 --> 21:54.075
Where are you going?
Where are you taking me?

21:54.111 --> 21:56.204
I told you.
I wanna save it for a surprise.

21:56.313 --> 22:01.842
Hey. Are you the kind of kid who reads
the last page of a mystery first?

22:01.919 --> 22:04.183
Who pesters the magician to tell you his tricks?

22:04.221 --> 22:07.019
Who sneaks downstairs to peek
at his Christmas presents?

22:07.057 --> 22:09.218
No. Of course you´re not!

22:09.326 --> 22:13.023
That´s why
~ I'm not gonna tell you ~

22:13.130 --> 22:15.963
Oh, God.

22:16.033 --> 22:19.730
Besides, I just love surprises, don´t you?

22:19.837 --> 22:22.032
Hey, look out!

22:22.139 --> 22:24.733
- Stop! - Oh, dear!
- Hit the brakes!

22:24.842 --> 22:26.639
Hey...

22:31.748 --> 22:33.443
Ohhh, sh...

23:24.334 --> 23:28.327
Shifting into star drive
at Columbus Theta. Hold tight.

24:14.851 --> 24:16.910
Prea tahd. Prea tahd na.

24:17.020 --> 24:19.511
- Prea tahd na.
- Prea tahd na.

24:19.623 --> 24:23.923
- Prea tahd na sat suela. Prea tahd na.

25:28.925 --> 25:32.952
Hey. Hey, let me out of here!

25:49.179 --> 25:51.443
Rinkyin see.

25:53.350 --> 25:58.788
Kitae. Kitae.

26:02.292 --> 26:06.422
- Kitae.

26:13.236 --> 26:17.639
- There´s a perfectly logical explanation for all this.
- Kitae.

26:25.649 --> 26:28.812
Kitae un na.
Na.

26:32.823 --> 26:36.122
- Hey! Wa... Wait! Where you going?

26:51.341 --> 26:55.038
Hi! How are you?
Uh, what is this?

26:55.145 --> 26:57.443
Listen.
Do you speak English? I'd...

26:57.547 --> 26:59.538
Uh, this is nice but, uh...

27:03.220 --> 27:06.986
- Hisanja pt.
- Hisanja?

27:07.090 --> 27:12.790
- Honee mat suela!
Prea tahd, prea tahd. Pt pt.

27:12.829 --> 27:14.990
Centauri, what´s goin´ on here?

27:15.098 --> 27:17.293
- He´s just saying how delighted he is
that you´re here. - Na prea.

27:17.334 --> 27:20.792
And if there´s anything he can do to make
your stay more enjoyable, just give him a ring.

27:20.837 --> 27:23.601
My stay? What are you talkin´ about?
Where are we?

27:23.707 --> 27:25.800
Welcome to Rylos, my boy!

27:25.909 --> 27:28.503
- Rylos?

27:28.612 --> 27:31.103
Wait a minute. You mean...
You mean like in the game?

27:31.148 --> 27:33.946
Oh, he´s quick. He´s quick.
He´s very quick. He´s speechless.

27:34.050 --> 27:35.950
So long, Alex!
Have fun!

27:36.052 --> 27:39.920
May the luck of the Seven Pillars
of Gulu be with you at all times.

27:40.023 --> 27:43.424
Oh, someday these cheapskates
will thank Centauri. Trust me.

27:43.527 --> 27:45.427
Bula!

27:48.231 --> 27:50.825
Where the hell is June?

27:55.338 --> 27:57.772
Yolanda, baby!

28:08.385 --> 28:10.512
Hi, Maggs.

28:10.587 --> 28:13.784
Hi, Louis.
Is he up?

28:13.890 --> 28:18.486
Yeah. He´s been up all night... moaning.

28:22.732 --> 28:26.224
- Alex?

28:28.104 --> 28:32.097
Your mother told me about the loan.
Is there anything I can do?

28:39.516 --> 28:43.452
Listen. I'll be next door
if you need anything, okay?

29:59.529 --> 30:01.463
Gunstars.

30:03.733 --> 30:05.963
I gotta be dreamin´.

30:06.036 --> 30:10.234
Eeyai... kita.

30:10.340 --> 30:12.638
Yeah, right. Kita.

30:18.748 --> 30:20.978
Listen, there´s been a big mistake.

30:21.084 --> 30:24.713
- Immediately after
situation report. Navigation...

30:24.754 --> 30:27.052
Welcome to Starfighter Command.

30:27.157 --> 30:31.093
- You speak English?
- No. You hear English thanks
to your translator device.

30:31.161 --> 30:35.097
Hurry up. We haven´t got much
time. The briefing begins immediately.

30:35.165 --> 30:39.067
- Join the other recruits.
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

30:39.102 --> 30:41.070
Wait a minute!
What are you talking about, recruits?

30:43.973 --> 30:46.567
- I don´t believe this.

30:49.012 --> 30:53.312
Attention.
Attention please.
Ambassador Enduran has arrived...

30:53.383 --> 30:57.479
and will now address
Starfighter Command personnel.

30:59.723 --> 31:04.626
- As you all know, we have been on a desperate
quest... - Excuse me. Excuse me.

31:04.728 --> 31:07.720
- To find Starfighters and navigators

31:10.867 --> 31:14.735
I should... I should
crush you to gorun dust!

31:14.771 --> 31:16.932
I'm sorry, uh-uh...
It was an accident.

31:16.973 --> 31:21.239
L-l-I didn´t mean to step on your,
uh... whatever that is.

31:21.344 --> 31:24.575
- Hideous creature.
- If I may continue.

31:24.647 --> 31:29.949
- Our forces have...
- You don´t trifle with a Bogati. They love to fight.

31:29.986 --> 31:32.352
That´s why they´re perfect for this war.

31:34.090 --> 31:36.285
- Did you say ´´war´´?
- But of course!

31:36.359 --> 31:38.327
Why else do you think you´re here?

31:38.361 --> 31:40.761
You were recruited by the Star League to defend...

31:40.864 --> 31:44.595
´´... to defend the frontier against Xur
and the Kodan Armada. ´´

31:44.667 --> 31:46.601
Oy, vey.

31:46.669 --> 31:52.369
Eons ago, our ancestors
created our great frontier...

31:52.475 --> 31:57.879
a barrier of energy encircling
the peaceful systems of the universe.

31:57.914 --> 32:02.908
And forever shutting out
the scourge that lurks beyond.

32:04.554 --> 32:09.514
Fellow Rylans, because of a dark betrayal...

32:09.626 --> 32:12.618
- our frontier will soon collapse.

32:14.330 --> 32:19.324
So we turn to you, Starfighters
and your navigators.

32:19.436 --> 32:23.065
For of all the billions
of creatures in the Star League...

32:23.139 --> 32:28.839
only you few were found to possess the, uh...

32:28.945 --> 32:30.970
gift.

32:31.047 --> 32:34.278
You, and you alone...

32:34.384 --> 32:38.844
stand between us and
the black terror of the Kodan.

32:38.955 --> 32:44.393
- Victory or death!
- Victory or death!

32:44.494 --> 32:47.361
Victory or death!
Victory or death!

32:47.397 --> 32:50.298
Victory or death!
Victory or death!

32:50.366 --> 32:53.460
Victory or death!
Victory or death!

32:53.570 --> 32:55.868
Victory or death!
Victory or death!

32:55.905 --> 32:58.703
Victory or death!
Victory or death!

32:58.808 --> 33:01.902
Victory or death!
Victory or death!

33:01.945 --> 33:05.108
Victory or death!
Victory or death!

33:05.215 --> 33:08.446
Now, Starfighters, if you will
reach underneath your seats...

33:08.551 --> 33:12.954
- you will find a packet which
contains one hand trans...

33:16.025 --> 33:20.189
This is a restricted area off-limits to...

33:20.230 --> 33:24.360
My apologies, Starfighter.

33:24.467 --> 33:28.028
Star Navigator First Class Grig
at your service, sir!

33:30.874 --> 33:35.334
Hi. I'm Alex Rogan. I was playing this game
back home, and this guy came up to me.

33:35.378 --> 33:37.346
Only he´s not a guy.
He´s an alien, right?

33:37.447 --> 33:40.177
And I get into his car.
Only it´s not a car. It´s a spaceship.

33:40.283 --> 33:43.582
And, uh...
There´s been a big mistake.

33:43.653 --> 33:47.851
Am I to understand you´re actually declining
the honor of becoming a Starfighter?

33:47.957 --> 33:51.791
- You got it.
- Extraordinary!

33:51.861 --> 33:55.957
For eons, all creatures have
dreamt of being Starfighters.

33:56.065 --> 33:58.090
- Where you from?
- Earth.

33:58.201 --> 34:01.466
And we´re not at war with anybody
except each other.

34:01.571 --> 34:05.029
Earth? Earth isn´t a formal member
of the Star League...

34:05.141 --> 34:07.609
and isn´t due to be approached
until it matures.

34:07.644 --> 34:10.511
This is all highly irregular.

34:10.547 --> 34:12.811
Tell me.
Who recruited you?

34:12.916 --> 34:14.850
Centauri.

34:14.951 --> 34:19.752
- There he is. That´s him!
- Centauri. I might have known.

34:19.822 --> 34:22.916
~ Di-aye-diliddle-di-di
Dum, dum, diliddli... ~

34:22.958 --> 34:26.759
Up to your old Excalibur tricks
again, eh, Centauri?

34:26.829 --> 34:29.389
Did it ever occur to you
that it is against the law...

34:29.465 --> 34:32.127
to recruit from worlds
outside the Star League?

34:32.235 --> 34:36.728
Earth ´s in danger too, isn´t it? And,
no, I didn´t use the Excalibur test.

34:36.773 --> 34:39.936
It was called a video game.
What´s all the brouhaha?

34:40.043 --> 34:42.739
After all, he does have the gift!

34:42.779 --> 34:47.909
This may come as bit of a shock to you,
but he doesn´t want to be a Starfighter.

34:48.051 --> 34:51.543
Doesn´t want to be a...
Are you a coward?

34:51.654 --> 34:54.145
- Are you crazy?
- You didn´t tell me about any of this!

34:54.257 --> 34:56.885
Return the money, Centauri!

34:56.993 --> 35:00.360
Return the money?
Are you delirious?

35:00.463 --> 35:03.591
You know how long it took to invent
the games, to merchandise them...

35:03.633 --> 35:06.796
to get ´em into the stores by Christmas?

35:06.903 --> 35:10.839
It must be terribly embarrassing
for you, and I do sympathize. However...

35:10.907 --> 35:14.343
But I saw him fight! He could be
the greatest Starfighter ever!

35:14.410 --> 35:18.210
- That was a game, Centauri.
- A game?

35:18.247 --> 35:21.512
You may have thought it was a game,
but it was also a test.

35:21.551 --> 35:25.487
Aha! A test! Sent out across
the universe to find those...

35:25.521 --> 35:27.819
with the gift to be Starfighters.

35:27.890 --> 35:30.950
And here you are, my boy.
Here you are!

35:31.027 --> 35:35.327
- Right! Here I am, about to be killed!
- Killed.

35:35.365 --> 35:38.232
You don´t seriously think it´s
dangerous, do you?

35:38.334 --> 35:43.465
- Don´t be silly! Trust me!

35:59.255 --> 36:01.655
Xur!

36:01.724 --> 36:03.624
Xur!

36:03.693 --> 36:06.491
Xur?

36:06.596 --> 36:09.588
Yes, Father, your mighty frontier...

36:09.699 --> 36:12.600
grows weaker by the moment.

36:12.702 --> 36:16.331
Do not call me father!

36:16.439 --> 36:18.839
You are no longer my son!

36:18.908 --> 36:22.605
You´re an outcast!
Why have you returned?

36:22.712 --> 36:25.203
I have returned for the good of all Rylans.

36:25.314 --> 36:28.715
With an armada of Kodan
warships behind you?

36:28.751 --> 36:32.312
There are some Rylans
who would welcome me, Father.

36:32.422 --> 36:36.415
Star League justice put
down your Xurian cult.

36:36.526 --> 36:41.259
- Your followers are few and scattered.
- Star League?

36:41.364 --> 36:44.333
A refuge for weak worlds
not worthy to be our equals!

36:44.434 --> 36:47.369
That is for the Rylans to decide...

36:47.437 --> 36:51.533
and not for a dangerous and evil child
such as yourself.

36:51.574 --> 36:54.873
And yet it is this child...

36:54.977 --> 36:58.640
who caught your master spy.

37:26.542 --> 37:30.638
Hear me, Rylans!

37:30.713 --> 37:33.944
When the green moon of Galan is eclipsed...

37:34.016 --> 37:37.110
Kodan armada will invade.

37:37.153 --> 37:42.147
And not even your mighty Starfighters
will be able to save you.

37:42.258 --> 37:44.658
We shall see, Xur.

37:44.761 --> 37:46.820
We shall see!

37:57.540 --> 38:00.737
You still want to go?

38:00.843 --> 38:02.708
And miss all the excitement?

38:08.484 --> 38:10.816
Little brat. I invent
the game, find the kid...

38:10.887 --> 38:13.685
drag him up there, and he
doesn´t want to be a Starfighter.

38:13.790 --> 38:17.317
I give up!

38:52.528 --> 38:54.519
Control, do you copy
our star angle difference...

38:54.630 --> 38:57.622
from parking angle?

38:57.733 --> 39:02.500
Delta beta two at six,
delta gamma three at five.

39:07.410 --> 39:10.607
Emperor Xur ordered me
to bring his scepter.

39:12.381 --> 39:14.474
Let him enter.

39:14.584 --> 39:17.018
Target vector remains on scope.

39:31.200 --> 39:34.692
Just like your Kodan emperor´s,
isn´t it, Commander Kril?

39:34.804 --> 39:39.207
It takes more than
a scepter to rule, Xur...

39:39.308 --> 39:41.503
even on Rylos.

39:44.213 --> 39:47.011
You´re right, Kril.

39:47.116 --> 39:51.815
It does take more than a scepter.

39:58.327 --> 40:02.229
How long must we endure this fool?

40:02.265 --> 40:07.430
- We have a break in the frontier.
- Fire the meteor gun!

40:08.771 --> 40:12.229
My dear Kodan friends!
Lest we forget...

40:12.341 --> 40:16.937
it was your own emperor who
granted me command of this armada.

40:17.046 --> 40:20.538
For only I hold the secret to the frontier.

40:20.650 --> 40:23.346
Only I know the location
of the Starfighter base.

40:23.386 --> 40:27.652
And therefore, only I will
give the order to fire!

40:31.060 --> 40:33.153
Forgive me, Xur.

40:39.502 --> 40:42.665
You are forgiven, Commander Kril.

40:45.508 --> 40:49.103
Meteor gunner... fire.

41:21.577 --> 41:23.568
Sergeant!

41:25.982 --> 41:28.974
I have an unidentified
incoming object in Sector 31, sir.

41:33.756 --> 41:37.692
They´re headed for the base!
Alert! We are under attack!

41:37.760 --> 41:39.887
I repeat:
We are under attack!

41:41.263 --> 41:43.857
Activate automatic repulser guns.

42:37.186 --> 42:41.054
Condition Red! Condition Red!

42:50.166 --> 42:53.397
At last it is done!

42:53.469 --> 42:57.872
Soon the frontier will be down
and they will bow to their new emperor!

42:57.907 --> 43:00.899
Or I will darken the sky
with their ashes.

43:00.976 --> 43:04.002
Commander, the Xurian spy reports that
one Starfighter has escaped.

43:04.113 --> 43:08.447
Escaped?

43:19.462 --> 43:21.362
You sure I can´t give you a hand?

43:21.464 --> 43:26.128
- You´ve done quite enough already. Thank you.
- Well, uh...

43:26.235 --> 43:30.171
It´s only a few more miles from here.
I guess... I guess I can walk it.

43:30.239 --> 43:33.367
So long!
Bye, Centauri!

43:45.654 --> 43:48.589
Oh, Alex!

43:48.691 --> 43:51.057
Here!

43:55.064 --> 43:57.055
Hey, listen. I can´t take
a present from you, Centauri.

43:57.166 --> 44:01.660
Oh, ho-ho-ho... He reduces me to poverty
again and he thinks I'm giving him a present.

44:01.704 --> 44:03.899
- What a world this is.
- What is it, then?

44:04.006 --> 44:05.997
It´s a second chance, my boy!

44:06.108 --> 44:09.407
If you change your mind,
just tap the communo-crystals.

44:13.749 --> 44:16.309
- Keep it.
- Ahh, Alex, Alex!

44:16.418 --> 44:19.546
You´re walking away
from history. History!

44:19.655 --> 44:23.056
Did Chris Columbus say
he wanted to stay home? No!

44:23.159 --> 44:25.753
What if the Wright Brothers
thought that only birds should fly?

44:25.861 --> 44:30.924
- And did Geloca think the Yulus were too
ugly to save? - Who´s Geloca?

44:32.935 --> 44:35.529
Never mind.

44:35.571 --> 44:37.539
Listen, Centauri.
I'm not any of those guys.

44:37.640 --> 44:40.541
- I'm a kid from a trailer park.
- If that´s what you think...

44:40.643 --> 44:44.238
then that´s all you´ll ever be!

45:13.342 --> 45:16.038
Hey, Maggie!

45:16.145 --> 45:18.511
Listen to me. You´re not
going to believe this.

45:18.614 --> 45:21.310
I told you, Alex. Me and my...
how did you put it...

45:21.417 --> 45:25.649
strange sexual urges
aren´t talking to you anymore.

46:05.928 --> 46:09.989
- Who´s there!
- Shh! You´re gonna wake up Louis.

46:18.207 --> 46:23.008
- Hey, you look like me!
- ´Course I do. I'm the beta unit.

46:23.112 --> 46:28.914
- What the helI's a beta unit?
- A beta unit is a simuloid...

46:29.018 --> 46:32.146
an exact duplicate of you,
only not as loud.

46:32.221 --> 46:36.817
- Huh?
- I was in the starcar, remember?
We shook hands?

46:36.859 --> 46:40.351
I became you... unfortunately.

46:40.462 --> 46:46.128
- Let me get this straight. You´re a robot?
- I beg your pardon.

46:46.235 --> 46:49.534
I'm a state-of-the-art,
top-of-the-line beta unit...

46:49.638 --> 46:52.937
put here as a courtesy replacement
for while you´re away.

46:52.975 --> 46:55.466
Lucky me.

46:55.577 --> 46:59.536
- What are you doing back?
- Are you kidding? It´s war up there!

46:59.581 --> 47:03.381
Oh. Save the whales and not the universe, huh?

47:03.419 --> 47:05.478
Well, why don´t you go up there and fight?

47:05.521 --> 47:08.217
Simuloids can´t fight.
We´re not allowed.

47:08.324 --> 47:11.782
- Well, tell ´em that you´re me! Pretend!
- Be quiet, Alex.

47:11.894 --> 47:15.330
- Sorry, Louis.
- Sorry, Louis.

47:15.431 --> 47:19.197
- Thanks for the lift!
- See you around!

47:40.556 --> 47:42.717
Greetings, Starfighter.

47:42.758 --> 47:47.752
You have been recruited by the Star League
to defend the frontier against Xur and...

48:08.584 --> 48:11.610
- And, hey, what did you do to Maggie?
- Do to her?

48:11.720 --> 48:15.918
We´re sittin´ outside lookin´ at the stars
and she sticks her tongue in my ear.

48:16.024 --> 48:18.788
I screamed.
I'll apologize tomorrow, okay?

48:18.894 --> 48:22.022
You´re not gonna be here. You´re
goin´ back with Centauri right now!

48:22.097 --> 48:25.589
- What´s up, Alex?
- Back to sleep or I'm tellin´
Ma about your Playboys.

48:27.803 --> 48:30.294
- You´re blowin´ it, Alex!

48:35.411 --> 48:38.608
- What the shit?
- I said, back to sleep, Louis...

48:38.647 --> 48:42.014
or I'm tellin´ Ma about your Playboys!

48:42.050 --> 48:44.848
Come in, Centauri.

48:44.953 --> 48:47.922
Come on. Get back here.
And take your Tonka toy with ya.

48:48.023 --> 48:50.719
Greetings, Starfighter!

48:50.826 --> 48:54.262
You have been recruited by the Star
League to defend the frontier against...

48:54.329 --> 48:57.423
Xur and the Kodan armada.

48:57.533 --> 48:59.467
Gree... Greetings, Starfighter!

48:59.535 --> 49:03.869
You have been recruited by the Star League
to defend the-the frontier against Xur...

49:08.177 --> 49:10.475
Where are ya?
Come on, where are ya?

49:10.579 --> 49:13.013
Centauri?

49:13.115 --> 49:16.084
Greetings, Starfighter!

49:16.185 --> 49:18.085
Centauri?

50:19.448 --> 50:21.348
Oh, shit!

50:21.450 --> 50:23.850
Come on, Alex.
Don´t be such a wimp!

50:40.569 --> 50:42.469
- Centauri, look out!
- What the...

51:09.932 --> 51:15.234
Whew! Foul stench!
Dirty creatures.

51:18.240 --> 51:20.367
Get a good look, Alex.

51:20.442 --> 51:23.172
You can bet your asteroids
you´ll be seeing more of them.

51:23.245 --> 51:26.442
- What?
- This is a Zando-Zan.

51:26.548 --> 51:30.040
An interstellar hitbeast,
compliments of Xur.

51:30.085 --> 51:32.679
Xur? Why is he after me?

51:32.754 --> 51:34.688
Somehow he found out you´re a Starfighter.

51:34.790 --> 51:38.453
So you see, Alex,
you gotta go back. You got no choice.

51:38.560 --> 51:40.755
´Cause if you stay
down here, you´re dog meat.

51:40.862 --> 51:43.660
Trust Centauri, my boy.
Because in two hours...

51:43.699 --> 51:46.463
this place will be crawling
with ten Zando-Zans...

51:46.568 --> 51:50.470
with just one thought on their
microscopic little minds:

51:50.572 --> 51:54.167
- Kill Alex Rogan.
- Kill Alex Rogan.

51:54.276 --> 51:58.269
He´s right, Alex. At least up there
you´ll have a fighting chance in a Gunstar.

51:58.380 --> 52:01.747
Exactly. Meanwhile, down here,
they´ll be going after Beta.

52:01.850 --> 52:04.819
- Beta. - Beta?
- Of course.

52:04.853 --> 52:06.821
What do you think he´s here for?

52:06.855 --> 52:08.823
Wait a...
Wait a second here, Centauri.

52:08.857 --> 52:10.825
Alex, look out!

52:17.366 --> 52:20.335
Centauri!

52:20.369 --> 52:25.033
- Beta, get a doctor!
- No. No native cures. No witch doctors.

52:25.073 --> 52:27.132
I'm fine.
Just a scratch.

52:28.944 --> 52:34.041
Now face it, Alex.
You´re a born Starfighter.

52:35.884 --> 52:38.478
Are you with me?

52:46.895 --> 52:50.854
Okay, let´s go, Centauri.

52:51.900 --> 52:54.061
Good luck, Alex.

52:55.904 --> 52:59.067
You too, Alex.

53:20.128 --> 53:23.859
Centauri to Starfighter Command.

53:23.932 --> 53:28.733
Centauri to Starfighter Command.
Come in, please.

53:43.485 --> 53:45.385
Hey, Centauri.

53:49.357 --> 53:54.158
All personnel.
Starcar is approaching Docking Gate 12.

53:54.262 --> 53:58.392
Centauri! Centauri!

54:02.104 --> 54:04.402
Hey, hit the brakes!

54:09.511 --> 54:11.536
- Grig! Hey, Grig!
- Alex!

54:11.646 --> 54:13.637
They got Centauri.
He´s hurt!

54:13.715 --> 54:15.706
He´s right over here.

54:26.661 --> 54:29.960
Ah, you see?

54:30.065 --> 54:34.627
- Centauri brought him back!
- Yes, I see. Don´t talk.

54:34.669 --> 54:39.572
- Does he have my money, Alex?
- I have a fortune for you, Centauri.

54:39.641 --> 54:42.872
- Now, please be still.

54:42.944 --> 54:45.936
It´s here. It´s all here.
Piles and piles of it.

54:46.047 --> 54:48.948
All for you.

54:49.050 --> 54:51.848
Ah.

54:51.887 --> 54:55.345
At last.

54:55.390 --> 54:58.757
Alex, I want you know...

54:58.860 --> 55:01.727
it was for the greatest good
I brought you back.

55:03.598 --> 55:07.728
´Course, it-it...

55:07.803 --> 55:13.139
It never hurts to be rich.

55:19.948 --> 55:24.851
Until the next dimension, old friend.

55:26.221 --> 55:28.519
I'm sorry, Alex.

55:28.557 --> 55:30.525
Centauri?

55:35.964 --> 55:38.558
Centauri?

55:38.667 --> 55:42.728
The frontier could collapse at any moment.

55:42.838 --> 55:45.830
Alex!

56:40.128 --> 56:42.596
Now I need an ear job.

56:42.631 --> 56:45.225
Dyin´ here. Dyin´.

56:59.247 --> 57:02.273
Alex, what the helI's goin´ on?

57:02.384 --> 57:07.788
Louis, you´re having a terrible
nightmare. Go back to sleep.

57:12.093 --> 57:14.288
Louis!

57:27.842 --> 57:29.833
Oh, no.

57:39.521 --> 57:42.354
Am I to understand there´s a beta unit
taking your place back home?

57:42.457 --> 57:45.051
- He´s trying.
- So it´s safe to assume...

57:45.160 --> 57:47.128
that Xur thinks you´re still on Earth.

57:47.228 --> 57:49.662
Yeah.

57:49.731 --> 57:52.427
That could work to our advantage...
theoretically.

57:58.440 --> 58:02.069
Ah!
Now you look human!

58:03.878 --> 58:07.712
- Is this my Gunstar?
- This is a prototype... different
from the other ships.

58:07.816 --> 58:12.082
She has a greater range, more power,
and a slight weapons modification.

58:12.187 --> 58:14.587
And of course, she´s got deflective plating...

58:14.689 --> 58:17.624
so she can withstand several direct hits.

58:20.895 --> 58:23.193
- From here...

58:23.298 --> 58:27.496
this is where I navigate the ship, maintain
life support and propulsion systems.

58:28.703 --> 58:30.603
Okay. Where do I sit?

58:30.705 --> 58:33.435
- Way up there, in the gunnery chair.

58:36.211 --> 58:39.806
- Hang on!
- Okay.

58:44.052 --> 58:47.715
Now, climb into the gunnery chair.

58:47.756 --> 58:53.126
Now, I'm moving you into launch position.

58:53.228 --> 58:57.221
There in front of you are the two switches
for your heads-up display. Turn them on.

59:01.870 --> 59:06.307
While you´re engaging the enemy, the screen will
reflect all battle instruments toward you.

59:08.977 --> 59:12.071
- Hey, where did it go?
- It´s still there, suspended in a Xenon mist.

59:12.113 --> 59:16.573
- But it´s only visible if you look dead ahead.
- Ah. Got it.

59:16.618 --> 59:19.086
The lever on your left is the chair controller.

59:19.120 --> 59:21.714
As you can see, all guns
will track with your every move.

59:29.798 --> 59:32.392
Grasp the target control
with your right hand.

59:32.434 --> 59:36.336
At your fingers is the weaponry:
The lasers, photon bolts...

59:36.404 --> 59:39.396
Photon bolts and the particle beams.
Wait a minute. This is just like back home.

59:39.507 --> 59:44.706
- What´s this?
- Careful, that´s Death Blossom,
a weapon of last resort.

59:44.813 --> 59:47.805
Luckily, I was in here working on it
when the hangar went up.

59:47.849 --> 59:51.307
Now, are you ready?
All systems... Go!

59:52.954 --> 59:55.320
- Ignition!

59:58.526 --> 01:00:03.020
- Wh-When... When did the hangar go up?
- I told you: When Xur attacked.

01:00:03.131 --> 01:00:05.964
- And where were the Starfighters?
- In the hangar!

01:00:06.034 --> 01:00:10.630
- You mean they´re dead?
- Death is a primitive concept.

01:00:10.738 --> 01:00:15.835
I prefer to think of them
as battling evil in another dimension.

01:00:15.944 --> 01:00:18.174
In another dimension?
How many are left?

01:00:18.246 --> 01:00:21.340
- Including yourself?
- Yeah.

01:00:22.784 --> 01:00:25.446
- One!
- One?

01:00:37.565 --> 01:00:39.658
Hold it.

01:00:41.569 --> 01:00:44.367
There´s no fleet, no Starfighters, no plan?

01:00:44.472 --> 01:00:46.963
- One ship, you, me, and that´s it?
- Exactly!

01:00:47.075 --> 01:00:50.374
Xur thinks you´re still on Earth. Classic
military strategy. Surprise attack.

01:00:50.478 --> 01:00:52.912
- It´ll be a slaughter!
- That´s the spirit.

01:00:52.981 --> 01:00:56.314
No, my slaughter.
One ship against the whole armada?

01:00:56.417 --> 01:01:00.012
Yes. One Gunstar against the armada.

01:01:00.121 --> 01:01:05.058
I've always wanted to fight a desperate
battle against incredible odds.

01:01:07.562 --> 01:01:10.030
- Target lights, Alex.
- Target lights?

01:01:10.131 --> 01:01:13.623
Yes. You might want to squeeze off
a few rounds while you have a chance.

01:01:13.735 --> 01:01:15.635
Just work the bugs out of the system.

01:01:15.737 --> 01:01:18.365
After all, it is her maiden voyage.

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:41.424
Steady.
Don´t fight the chair.

01:01:41.462 --> 01:01:45.421
Take your time. Watch your gun sight.
Lead your targets.

01:01:45.466 --> 01:01:48.094
And above all, relax!

01:01:48.203 --> 01:01:51.468
Terrific. I'm about to get killed
a million miles from nowhere...

01:01:51.506 --> 01:01:54.703
with a gung-ho iguana
who tells me, ´´relax. ´´

01:01:57.612 --> 01:02:00.376
Interstellar!

01:02:30.945 --> 01:02:35.143
- Alex!
- Sorry.

01:02:37.752 --> 01:02:40.277
Okay, now, come on.
Ease it up.

01:02:42.557 --> 01:02:45.549
Okay.

01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:48.493
Oh, that´s... That´s it. Easy.

01:02:48.563 --> 01:02:51.361
Nice and easy.
Yep.

01:02:51.466 --> 01:02:54.993
- A little bit more and we´ll
get it in there, now.

01:02:55.103 --> 01:02:58.072
- Alex!

01:02:58.106 --> 01:03:00.802
Sorry.
Hi, Maggs.

01:03:00.908 --> 01:03:05.208
- Alex, are you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm-I'm fine.

01:03:06.714 --> 01:03:08.705
Come on.
Try it again.

01:03:09.917 --> 01:03:14.013
Did you smell anything?

01:03:14.055 --> 01:03:17.149
- Like what?
- Like a Z...

01:03:17.225 --> 01:03:19.455
Forget it.

01:03:26.868 --> 01:03:30.531
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry for slapping you last night.

01:03:31.939 --> 01:03:33.907
Oh, that-that´s okay,
Maggs. Uh...

01:03:33.941 --> 01:03:36.341
I deserved it.
I'm sorry.

01:03:36.444 --> 01:03:40.141
Well, maybe we can make it up
to each other tonight at Silver Lake?

01:04:09.444 --> 01:04:12.208
- The armada will break
through the frontier here...

01:04:12.246 --> 01:04:15.044
and reach Rylos in 20 klicks.

01:04:15.116 --> 01:04:17.516
Squadrons of deck fighters
will precede the mother ship.

01:04:17.618 --> 01:04:19.552
Squadrons?
How many squadrons?

01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:21.815
It isn´t the number of squadrons that concerns me.

01:04:21.923 --> 01:04:25.324
It´s this communication turret that sends out
the commands to the deck fighters...

01:04:25.426 --> 01:04:27.724
which enables them to act
as one during the fight.

01:04:27.762 --> 01:04:30.731
Wait a second. We knock out
the turret to get the fighters.

01:04:30.765 --> 01:04:34.064
But to get the turret, we have to
get through the fighters. We´re dead.

01:04:34.168 --> 01:04:37.467
I'll have it all figured out
by the time we reach the frontier.

01:04:40.742 --> 01:04:43.233
- What´s that?
- The frontier.

01:04:52.854 --> 01:04:56.187
Strange. What´s a cargo ship doing
this close to the frontier?

01:04:57.358 --> 01:05:00.191
Hail. This is Gunstar One.

01:05:04.232 --> 01:05:08.601
I repeat, this is Gunstar One.
Identify yourself, please.

01:05:11.005 --> 01:05:12.905
Alex, look out.

01:05:15.610 --> 01:05:17.703
A Xurian ship!

01:05:19.814 --> 01:05:23.545
Congratulations, Alex.
This is your first live target.

01:05:23.651 --> 01:05:25.949
Live?

01:05:29.023 --> 01:05:31.821
Within range in five klicks.
Get ready!

01:05:36.564 --> 01:05:39.328
I've blocked its beam of frequency,
so it can´t report back to the armada.

01:05:41.469 --> 01:05:43.334
- Fire when ready!
- Grig, wait!

01:05:53.347 --> 01:05:55.645
We mustn´t lose them
in these caves, Alex! Fire!

01:06:19.207 --> 01:06:22.108
Shoot, Alex!

01:06:25.146 --> 01:06:28.309
Shoot!

01:06:35.923 --> 01:06:38.357
You did it!

01:06:43.831 --> 01:06:48.325
I did it? You did it!
You almost got me killed!

01:06:49.770 --> 01:06:53.672
Uh... My deepest
apologies, Alex.

01:06:53.774 --> 01:06:59.041
I had hoped that by putting you in the thick
of battle, a great Starfighter would emerge.

01:06:59.146 --> 01:07:04.083
But alas. Perhaps... there was
never one within you to begin with.

01:07:06.687 --> 01:07:08.587
I shall take you home.

01:07:10.224 --> 01:07:14.183
You still may live
a long and fruitful life back there.

01:07:14.228 --> 01:07:18.790
That is, until the Kodan reach Earth.

01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:20.800
But then again...

01:07:31.646 --> 01:07:34.911
~ When it all goes wrong ~

01:07:35.016 --> 01:07:38.247
Hey, yo, Blake!
Make that sucker blast, man!

01:07:38.319 --> 01:07:41.254
- You got it, dude! All right!
- Whoo!

01:07:41.322 --> 01:07:45.258
~ You´ve seen things I never heard ~~

01:07:47.128 --> 01:07:49.824
So Blake comes back in
to grab his pants, right?

01:07:49.931 --> 01:07:55.062
Sees her old lady, and says, ´´I hope this
doesn´t rule out dinner on Tuesday night. ´´

01:07:56.837 --> 01:07:58.737
That´s my man!

01:08:01.976 --> 01:08:04.706
Alex, are you okay?

01:08:04.779 --> 01:08:08.772
Hmm?
Yeah, sure. Why?

01:08:08.883 --> 01:08:13.911
I don´t know. You´re just acting spaced
out. You´re... You´re not yourself.

01:08:15.790 --> 01:08:18.917
Well, if you were me...

01:08:18.993 --> 01:08:21.291
what would you be doing right now?

01:08:24.131 --> 01:08:27.999
Well, for one thing,
I'd be trying to enjoy myself.

01:08:28.069 --> 01:08:30.697
Leaning back.
Kidding around.

01:08:30.805 --> 01:08:33.205
- Laughing.
- Laughing?

01:08:33.307 --> 01:08:35.241
Well, it´s a start, Alex.

01:08:35.343 --> 01:08:38.710
- Laughing.
~ There are things I'd like to say ~~

01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:24.981
Nice place.
Reminds me of home.

01:09:25.026 --> 01:09:28.894
- This reminds you of home?
- Oh, yes.

01:09:33.701 --> 01:09:36.225
I live below ground...

01:09:36.303 --> 01:09:41.002
with my wifeoid and 6,000 little Griglings.

01:09:48.015 --> 01:09:52.008
At least, until Xur
turns them into slaves.

01:09:57.058 --> 01:10:01.119
- Where does your kind live?
- Oh, uh, houses, mostly.

01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:04.523
That´s caves above ground.

01:10:04.598 --> 01:10:08.034
See, here.
Here´s my family.

01:10:09.837 --> 01:10:11.828
See, that´s...

01:10:11.872 --> 01:10:14.534
That´s my folks and my brother, Louis...

01:10:14.575 --> 01:10:16.873
and that´s Maggie.

01:10:18.279 --> 01:10:20.247
Uh, we live
in a mobile home.

01:10:22.149 --> 01:10:25.175
That´s a cave that...
that goes places.

01:10:25.286 --> 01:10:27.754
Only we never went anyplace.

01:10:29.857 --> 01:10:33.850
A mobile cave that never went anywhere.
Fascinating.

01:10:33.961 --> 01:10:37.954
Yeah, but we have below-ground caves
near the trailer parks.

01:10:37.998 --> 01:10:40.967
Me and my brother, Louis,
used to play hide-and-seek in ´em.

01:10:42.803 --> 01:10:44.771
Hide-and-seek.

01:10:44.872 --> 01:10:47.773
- What is it, Alex?
- Well, I was just thinkin´...

01:10:47.875 --> 01:10:49.809
maybe we could hide here...

01:10:49.877 --> 01:10:54.075
Let the armada pass by,
and then hit the turret from behind.

01:10:54.115 --> 01:10:56.379
Then we might take them by surprise.

01:11:02.022 --> 01:11:04.217
Your plan might really have worked.

01:11:04.325 --> 01:11:08.159
What a pity there are no Starfighters
left to carry it out.

01:11:08.262 --> 01:11:11.163
Yeah. Yeah.

01:11:18.773 --> 01:11:20.638
A Xurian base!

01:11:38.659 --> 01:11:41.355
Two more dead ahead!
Closing fast!

01:12:05.519 --> 01:12:08.215
- Earth course is logged
into navigational beams.

01:12:10.591 --> 01:12:14.550
- Grig?
- What is it, Alex?

01:12:19.834 --> 01:12:22.064
Maybe there is a Starfighter left.

01:13:01.575 --> 01:13:04.635
Ow!

01:13:10.618 --> 01:13:13.416
What´s wrong? Should I
put my tongue in your ear now?

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:16.148
Don´t bother, Alex.

01:13:16.257 --> 01:13:19.124
Well, it´s just... I'm kind of new
at these gland games.

01:13:20.628 --> 01:13:22.721
What are you talking about?

01:13:22.830 --> 01:13:25.355
It´s like you´re a million miles away, Alex!

01:13:35.542 --> 01:13:37.942
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait. Darling.

01:13:38.045 --> 01:13:40.946
Darling, forgive me.

01:13:50.157 --> 01:13:52.648
Darling, forgive me.

01:13:55.696 --> 01:13:58.256
Come on!

01:13:58.365 --> 01:14:01.163
You´re my Juliet.
My Venus.

01:14:05.205 --> 01:14:09.198
You´re my Juliet.
My Venus.

01:14:12.646 --> 01:14:16.707
- Alex!
- All the other girls meant nothing to me.

01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:19.810
It was you, you, you.

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:23.822
Shut up and talk dirty to me.

01:14:23.857 --> 01:14:26.826
The other girls meant
nothing to me. It was you...

01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:29.420
you, y...

01:14:30.965 --> 01:14:33.126
- Should I talk dirty to you now?

01:14:33.233 --> 01:14:38.535
- That does it.
- Oh, God. All right. I give up.

01:14:38.639 --> 01:14:41.039
- I'm not Alex Rogan.
- What?

01:14:41.141 --> 01:14:44.440
I'm a beta unit.
I'm an exact duplicate of Alex.

01:14:44.545 --> 01:14:47.639
He´s up there saving the universe,
while I'm down here for target practice.

01:14:49.783 --> 01:14:52.251
- See?

01:14:58.959 --> 01:15:02.486
- Alex! Or whatever you are. Wait. Wait.

01:15:02.529 --> 01:15:05.293
What are you d... Let me go. If that Zando-Zan
reports back that I'm not Alex...

01:15:05.332 --> 01:15:07.300
Alex is in big trouble!

01:15:07.334 --> 01:15:10.098
- You´re stayin´ here.
- No, I'm not going anywhere until
I find out what´s going on!

01:15:12.606 --> 01:15:14.631
Hey, my truck!

01:15:14.742 --> 01:15:17.006
- Hey, hey, come back!

01:15:18.312 --> 01:15:20.405
Scratch that paint, and you´re dead, Rogan!

01:15:30.424 --> 01:15:32.517
Ready to invade, Commander.

01:15:32.626 --> 01:15:36.653
- Invade.
- The Xurian ships have not
answered our invasion code.

01:15:36.730 --> 01:15:41.064
The frontier is down, the moon is eclipsed,
the Starfighters are dead. Invade!

01:15:42.536 --> 01:15:46.438
All squadrons ahead, half speed,
with energy probes on.

01:16:17.137 --> 01:16:19.628
Energy probe.
Shut down, Alex. Shut down.

01:16:19.706 --> 01:16:22.197
- Power off.

01:16:39.359 --> 01:16:42.817
Alex? In space?

01:16:42.930 --> 01:16:46.627
- Is this for real?
- Yes! That´s what I'm trying to tell you!

01:16:46.733 --> 01:16:50.032
- It´s all for real!
- Well, then, don´t talk. Drive!

01:17:02.716 --> 01:17:05.708
Commander Kril, we´re getting
a signal on the alert frequency.

01:17:05.819 --> 01:17:08.686
- Acknowledge.

01:17:11.191 --> 01:17:14.024
There it is. All right. Now, when
I give the signal, we´re gonna jump!

01:17:14.128 --> 01:17:17.291
- What do you mean, ´´jump´´?
- We´re gonna ram him. - What?

01:17:18.499 --> 01:17:21.297
Extermination Emissary
Zeta-six one message:

01:17:21.401 --> 01:17:23.335
- Ready?
- Jump!

01:17:23.437 --> 01:17:26.406
Alex!

01:17:26.507 --> 01:17:30.307
- The last Starfighter...

01:17:30.410 --> 01:17:32.901
You owe me one, Alex.

01:17:38.552 --> 01:17:42.352
- Alex!

01:17:42.422 --> 01:17:44.720
Transmission pulsars
have stopped, Commander.

01:17:44.758 --> 01:17:49.320
- The last Starfighter...
- Is dead!

01:17:49.429 --> 01:17:52.330
The last Starfighter
is dead!

01:17:52.432 --> 01:17:56.459
Nothing can stop us now.
Ahead full. To Rylos!

01:18:17.090 --> 01:18:19.320
The command ship!

01:18:24.231 --> 01:18:27.200
There!
The turret at the far end!

01:18:27.301 --> 01:18:30.293
I see it.

01:18:32.439 --> 01:18:37.001
- Good luck, Starfighter.
- Thanks, Grig. For everything.

01:18:50.624 --> 01:18:53.525
I love you,
Alex Rogan.

01:18:53.627 --> 01:18:56.425
- Six.

01:18:56.463 --> 01:18:59.125
- Heads up display. Check.
- Five.

01:18:59.233 --> 01:19:02.760
- Lasers. Check. - Four.
- Particle beam. Check.

01:19:02.869 --> 01:19:05.167
- Three.
- Proton bolts. Check.

01:19:05.272 --> 01:19:07.672
- Two.
- Chair control. Check.

01:19:07.708 --> 01:19:10.871
- One.
- Let´s do it.

01:19:21.288 --> 01:19:24.086
- Tracking alert.

01:19:26.627 --> 01:19:29.528
Unidentified craft.
What is it?

01:19:34.501 --> 01:19:37.698
Wait. Gunstar!

01:19:37.738 --> 01:19:42.107
So... the last Starfighter
is dead?

01:19:44.044 --> 01:19:46.512
This has gone far enough.
Seize him!

01:19:48.015 --> 01:19:51.314
How dare you?
I am the Emperor of Rylos!

01:19:51.418 --> 01:19:54.353
I and I alone command this entire op...

01:19:54.454 --> 01:19:57.150
Release me!
I command you!

01:19:57.224 --> 01:20:00.216
You will pay for this with your lives!

01:20:00.327 --> 01:20:03.228
All guns... fire!

01:20:12.673 --> 01:20:14.937
There it is... the turret!

01:20:14.975 --> 01:20:18.274
Alex, now!

01:20:18.378 --> 01:20:22.041
- Yeah!
- Got it!

01:20:22.082 --> 01:20:25.574
Hurry, Alex! Fire!
The armada´s almost to Rylos!

01:20:43.470 --> 01:20:47.406
Hatchway to pod activated.

01:20:49.376 --> 01:20:51.310
Escape pod ignition.

01:20:51.378 --> 01:20:55.678
The Gunstar is gone from our sensors.
Alert wing commanders.

01:20:55.782 --> 01:20:58.808
Communication turret is destroyed.

01:21:03.857 --> 01:21:06.724
All communication radar systems
are out, Wing Commander.

01:21:06.827 --> 01:21:10.422
Proceed with a visual attack formation.

01:21:14.534 --> 01:21:18.368
- Life support good. Ammo packs at peak.

01:21:18.472 --> 01:21:20.372
I think we´ve got to use Death Blossom.

01:21:20.474 --> 01:21:23.932
Remember, Death Blossom delivers
only one massive volley at close range.

01:21:24.044 --> 01:21:27.844
- Theoretically.
- What do you mean, ´´Theoretically´´?

01:21:27.881 --> 01:21:29.872
After all, D.B.
Has never been tested.

01:21:29.950 --> 01:21:32.748
It might overload the systems.
Blow up the ship.

01:21:32.786 --> 01:21:35.482
What are you worried about?
Theoretically, we should already be dead.

01:21:35.589 --> 01:21:37.750
- Hmm. Mmm.

01:21:37.791 --> 01:21:41.056
Open Death Blossom petals.
Switch is on.

01:21:55.308 --> 01:21:57.572
Do not trigger D.B.
Until we´re within range.

01:21:57.611 --> 01:22:00.171
Just use your lasers until I give the signal.

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:02.714
- Remember...
- I've been recruited by the Star League...

01:22:02.816 --> 01:22:05.011
to defend the frontier.

01:22:05.118 --> 01:22:08.747
- Now, are you ready?
- This is it. Here we go.

01:22:08.822 --> 01:22:11.620
Charge!

01:22:40.153 --> 01:22:42.644
On your right!

01:22:42.756 --> 01:22:45.657
Your left!

01:22:45.759 --> 01:22:48.853
Evade!

01:22:50.864 --> 01:22:53.389
Power packs are low!
We need time to recharge!

01:22:55.502 --> 01:22:58.869
Laser power draining!

01:23:05.812 --> 01:23:09.111
Grig, my weapons are gone!
Should I do it?

01:23:09.216 --> 01:23:13.414
Easy, easy. Wait till they´re
all in Death Blossom range!

01:23:22.028 --> 01:23:23.962
Fire!

01:23:56.663 --> 01:24:00.895
- We did it.
- Yes, we actually did, didn´t we?

01:24:04.504 --> 01:24:06.495
The command ship!

01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:09.805
Our guns are out.
Damage control is repairing them.

01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:13.607
Forget the guns!
Ramming speed!

01:24:21.655 --> 01:24:25.113
- Grig, we need power!
- Death Blossom´s drained all power.

01:24:25.158 --> 01:24:29.219
I'm working on it.
I'm trying to ram boost.

01:24:32.265 --> 01:24:35.428
All we have left is life support power!

01:24:41.541 --> 01:24:45.341
- Grig!

01:24:49.449 --> 01:24:52.543
All right!

01:24:58.358 --> 01:25:02.089
Weapons on! Target now! Fire. Fire!

01:25:24.517 --> 01:25:26.815
Damage report!

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:31.118
Guidance system out.
Auxiliary steering out.

01:25:31.157 --> 01:25:34.957
Divert!
Divert!

01:25:35.028 --> 01:25:38.930
She won´t answer the helm! We´re locked
in the moon´s gravitational pull!

01:25:39.032 --> 01:25:41.830
What do we do?

01:25:42.969 --> 01:25:45.836
- We die.

01:25:56.249 --> 01:25:58.149
Yahoo!

01:26:07.193 --> 01:26:10.094
On behalf of the Star League
and all citizens of Rylos...

01:26:10.196 --> 01:26:13.461
I congratulate you on your dazzling victory.

01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:15.468
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

01:26:15.502 --> 01:26:18.801
But as you know, the frontier is down...

01:26:18.905 --> 01:26:22.136
Xur escaped, and there is still danger.

01:26:22.208 --> 01:26:24.301
So I was wondering if you
wouldn´t be willing to stay on...

01:26:24.344 --> 01:26:27.006
and rebuild the Starfighter Legion.

01:26:27.047 --> 01:26:29.015
Wait a minute.

01:26:29.049 --> 01:26:32.018
- Rebuild the Legion?
- Yes.

01:26:32.052 --> 01:26:37.251
Of course, you´d have
the help of an old friend.

01:26:37.357 --> 01:26:39.518
An old friend?
Who?

01:26:55.075 --> 01:26:57.737
Centauri!
I thought you were dead!

01:26:57.844 --> 01:27:01.780
Me die and miss all the excitement?
Oh, no.

01:27:01.815 --> 01:27:05.979
I was merely dormant while my body repaired
itself. I won´t bore you with details.

01:27:06.086 --> 01:27:10.614
Suffice it to say, you´re on Rylos,
my boy. Stop thinking human.

01:27:10.724 --> 01:27:14.592
That´s lesson number one.
Now, lesson number two...

01:27:14.627 --> 01:27:18.688
You´ve got a good thing going here.
Keep smiling. Don´t blow it.

01:27:18.798 --> 01:27:22.325
Lesson number three...
Always trust Centauri.

01:27:26.906 --> 01:27:28.999
Alex, they love you!

01:27:33.113 --> 01:27:37.550
See? All Rylos is behind you.

01:27:37.650 --> 01:27:41.347
- You´ve got to stay, Alex!
- You will stay, won´t you?

01:27:41.454 --> 01:27:44.287
Of course he´ll stay.

01:27:44.324 --> 01:27:48.920
That´s very reassuring, Centauri.
Grig, I leave it in your capable hands.

01:27:51.030 --> 01:27:53.624
I'll stay.

01:28:04.811 --> 01:28:08.269
Alex! Alex!

01:28:21.795 --> 01:28:26.289
Greetings... Greetings, starfighter.

01:28:26.332 --> 01:28:29.233
- Bunny, have you seen Alex?
- Can´t say that I have.

01:28:29.302 --> 01:28:33.705
Well, ask Maggie. She knows
where he is. She was with him.

01:28:33.807 --> 01:28:36.002
Maggie, where´s Alex?

01:28:36.042 --> 01:28:38.306
Yeah, where´s my truck?
Where´s your boyfriend?

01:28:38.344 --> 01:28:42.508
- Mrs. Rogan, about Alex: You see, he´s...

01:28:44.350 --> 01:28:46.716
- What is it?
- What´s going on? I don´t know.

01:29:09.075 --> 01:29:11.066
Oh, my God!

01:29:12.512 --> 01:29:15.879
Whoo! All right!
We´re being invaded!

01:29:43.710 --> 01:29:46.304
Maggie.

01:29:46.346 --> 01:29:48.314
Maggie.

01:30:50.009 --> 01:30:53.069
- Alex?
- Hi, Maggs.

01:30:54.213 --> 01:30:58.479
Alex, is it you?

01:30:58.584 --> 01:31:01.485
I mean, is it really you?

01:31:05.525 --> 01:31:08.517
Look!

01:31:08.628 --> 01:31:10.994
My God.

01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:12.998
It is you.

01:31:13.032 --> 01:31:15.523
- It´s Alex! Alex!

01:31:15.635 --> 01:31:19.036
- Alex, what is going on here?
What is this thing?

01:31:24.744 --> 01:31:28.646
- Is this a spaceship?

01:31:28.748 --> 01:31:31.945
- I don´t know what´s gotten into him.
- I don´t understand that.

01:31:32.051 --> 01:31:35.179
- It´s so strange!
- Wait. Hold it. Hold it, everybody.

01:31:35.254 --> 01:31:38.553
Alex, what is all this?

01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:43.058
I, uh... I've been
to another planet, Ma.

01:31:43.162 --> 01:31:47.258
- Another planet?
- Who was it helped fix my antenna?

01:31:47.367 --> 01:31:49.767
- Yeah, who stole my truck?
- And cut my electric?

01:31:49.869 --> 01:31:53.703
- And ruined my stove?
- Oh, that was... That was a beta unit.

01:31:53.773 --> 01:31:56.298
- Beta unit?
- A robot.

01:31:56.376 --> 01:31:58.503
- Robot? What the...
- Come on!

01:31:58.611 --> 01:32:01.102
- A monster!

01:32:01.180 --> 01:32:06.049
- A monster! Hah!

01:32:06.119 --> 01:32:10.249
- He got them chains on him.
- All right! It´s an alien!

01:32:10.356 --> 01:32:13.757
Oh, no, wait! Hey, hey! Granny, put away
that shotgun. What´s wrong with you?

01:32:13.860 --> 01:32:16.727
This is my friend Grig. I want you all
to meet my friend here.

01:32:16.829 --> 01:32:20.321
- You gotta be kiddin´!
- Grig, this is Mrs. Boone.

01:32:21.567 --> 01:32:24.058
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:32:24.137 --> 01:32:26.435
- And, uh, this is Elvira.
- Delighted.

01:32:26.472 --> 01:32:29.168
- Me too. How you doin´?
- I do well.

01:32:29.242 --> 01:32:32.040
- And this is Granny.
- How do you do?

01:32:32.145 --> 01:32:34.045
- How do you do?

01:32:34.147 --> 01:32:36.547
- And this here´s Otis.
- A pleasure.

01:32:36.649 --> 01:32:40.050
Any friend of Alex...

01:32:40.153 --> 01:32:43.281
- And, uh, this is Maggie.

01:32:43.356 --> 01:32:45.654
A very large pleasure.

01:32:45.758 --> 01:32:47.692
Hi.

01:32:51.064 --> 01:32:53.897
You must be Louis!

01:32:56.169 --> 01:32:58.763
I hear good things about you.

01:32:58.805 --> 01:33:01.569
Hear that, you slimes?
I'm famous.

01:33:04.110 --> 01:33:06.203
And, uh, this is my mom.

01:33:09.115 --> 01:33:12.209
You should be proud
of Alex, Mrs. Rogan.

01:33:12.318 --> 01:33:15.151
You must all be proud of him.
He saved the Star League...

01:33:15.254 --> 01:33:17.950
and hundreds of worlds, including Earth.

01:33:18.024 --> 01:33:21.152
- Oh, for heaven´s sake!
- Oh, my God!

01:33:23.329 --> 01:33:25.456
Time to leave, Alex.

01:33:25.565 --> 01:33:28.534
- Alex?
- I have to, Ma.

01:33:28.634 --> 01:33:32.092
- They need me up there.
- Oh, Alex, I always knew you´d leave someday...

01:33:32.138 --> 01:33:34.629
but I never expected this.

01:33:34.740 --> 01:33:36.970
Gee, can I go too, Alex?
Can I?

01:33:37.076 --> 01:33:39.510
Sorry, squirt.
There´s only enough room up there...

01:33:39.545 --> 01:33:43.379
for me, Grig and Maggie.

01:33:43.449 --> 01:33:47.249
- Me?
- Yeah.

01:33:47.353 --> 01:33:50.186
Alex, l...
I don´t think I can...

01:33:50.256 --> 01:33:52.747
Come here.
Come here.

01:33:52.859 --> 01:33:55.054
Why else do you think I came back?

01:33:55.094 --> 01:33:57.858
- Well...
- Didn´t we say we´d always be together?

01:33:57.897 --> 01:34:01.560
Well, yeah... I mean,
together here or in the city.

01:34:01.667 --> 01:34:03.532
But...
But up there, Alex...

01:34:03.603 --> 01:34:06.731
Maggs, you gotta come. You see, I'm not...
I don´t know when I'm gonna be back.

01:34:08.307 --> 01:34:10.275
Don´t you see? This is it.
This is our big chance.

01:34:10.309 --> 01:34:12.539
It´s like what Otis says...

01:34:12.612 --> 01:34:15.911
When it comes you gotta grab on
with both hands and hold tight.

01:34:19.051 --> 01:34:22.851
Well, what about Granny, Alex?

01:34:26.425 --> 01:34:30.191
You´re right.
I'm scared of leaving here.

01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:32.197
Why can´t you just stay?

01:34:32.231 --> 01:34:35.667
Maggie, I have to leave,
and I want you to come with me.

01:34:39.038 --> 01:34:42.838
Alex! Hurry!

01:34:46.045 --> 01:34:48.639
- Well, I gotta go.
- Um...

01:34:51.450 --> 01:34:53.441
Bye.

01:34:57.456 --> 01:34:59.583
Alex, we can´t hold off
their radar any longer.

01:34:59.659 --> 01:35:01.684
Yeah, okay.
I gotta go, Ma.

01:35:01.727 --> 01:35:03.695
- Bye. Take it easy.
- Bye, darling.

01:35:03.729 --> 01:35:05.697
So long.
So long, everybody.

01:35:05.731 --> 01:35:07.790
- Bye, Alex!
- Bye!

01:35:07.900 --> 01:35:11.700
Bye, Alex. Bye, Alex!

01:35:20.746 --> 01:35:22.805
Alex!

01:35:22.848 --> 01:35:25.840
Granny...

01:35:25.952 --> 01:35:29.649
Be sure and write,
or whatever it is they do up there.

01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:36.928
Alex!
Wait, Alex!

01:35:55.982 --> 01:35:57.973
- Get back! Come on!
- Bye!

01:35:58.050 --> 01:35:59.984
- Keep your distance!
- Watch what you´re doing.

01:36:00.052 --> 01:36:03.681
Keep your distance, now.
This baby really packs a punch!

01:36:07.793 --> 01:36:09.727
Look at him!
Bye!

01:36:13.799 --> 01:36:19.203
Oh, go on. They´re gonna be
happy up there! So long, Alex!

01:36:19.238 --> 01:36:22.730
- So long, Alex!

01:36:26.345 --> 01:36:29.007
- We´re gonna be famous, aren´t we, Otis?
- Yes, sir!

01:36:29.048 --> 01:36:32.643
The whole world... the whole universe...
is gonna know about us!

01:36:32.718 --> 01:36:37.712
Starlite, Starbrite... The place where
Alex and Maggie left for the stars!

01:36:37.823 --> 01:36:40.656
Louis!
Louis!

01:36:40.726 --> 01:36:44.162
Greetings, Starfighter. You have been
recruited by the Star League...

01:36:44.230 --> 01:36:48.030
to defend the frontier against Xur
and the Kodan Armada.

01:36:55.574 --> 01:36:58.065
Wow!
