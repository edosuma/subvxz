<i>Previously on Underground...
She ain't comin' with us.</i>

00:07.850 --> 00:09.916
Slavery ain't just a sin,

00:09.952 --> 00:11.284
it's a state of war.

00:12.087 --> 00:14.120
You want to be a nigger?

00:14.156 --> 00:15.822
'Cause I will brand you like one.

00:16.992 --> 00:18.225
<i>Massas is worried about</i>

00:18.260 --> 00:20.861
<i>somebody named John Brown
stealin' slaves.</i>

00:20.896 --> 00:22.028
If there was a map

00:22.064 --> 00:24.197
<i>to all the safe houses
on the Underground...</i>

00:24.233 --> 00:25.298
There is.

00:25.334 --> 00:26.334
We've got cargo.

What you doin' in here?

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

03:10.207 --> 03:12.140
Ain't this Miss Georgia's room?

03:12.175 --> 03:14.175
That it is.

03:17.489 --> 03:19.280
You cargo, too?

03:21.184 --> 03:22.784
No.

03:22.819 --> 03:26.287
I just tidy up from time to time
for Miss Georgia.

03:26.323 --> 03:28.556
Now that's two questions
of yours I done answered,

03:28.592 --> 03:30.297
and I only asked you one.

03:30.333 --> 03:33.895
I-I just heard some of us
might be movin' on soon,

03:34.923 --> 03:37.284
and I wanted to thank her
for all she done for me.

03:41.405 --> 03:43.371
I think she's in the kitchen.

03:43.407 --> 03:45.083
I appreciate it.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.345
Minty.

04:16.440 --> 04:18.173
And why aren't you?
He came into your house.

04:18.208 --> 04:20.695
And he walked right
back out. No one was harmed.

04:20.731 --> 04:22.241
So you just want to ignore the threat.

04:22.265 --> 04:23.478
Well, of course not.

04:23.513 --> 04:26.347
But Rosalee's returning with
her family by week's end...

04:32.122 --> 04:34.022
Your plan's not working.

04:34.057 --> 04:35.101
I got something at the boardinghouse.

04:35.125 --> 04:36.235
I just need a little more time.

04:36.259 --> 04:37.659
Well, I'm losing my patience

04:37.694 --> 04:40.228
with all my niggers resting
comfortably in station houses.

04:41.398 --> 04:43.565
Not to mention money.

04:45.535 --> 04:47.268
There's this woman,
she was sweepin' floors,

04:47.304 --> 04:49.104
but she matched
the description of Harriet.

04:49.139 --> 04:51.272
She's the most notorious slave stealer

04:51.308 --> 04:53.987
there is, and you think she is

04:54.022 --> 04:57.212
sweeping floors in her downtime?

04:57.248 --> 04:59.781
You've been there three days,
and you've got nothing.

04:59.816 --> 05:01.683
The way I figure it,

05:01.718 --> 05:03.918
they're gonna be moving you north soon.

05:03.954 --> 05:06.921
Maybe you think this is
your chance to escape.

05:19.703 --> 05:22.237
I'm right where I want to be.

05:22.272 --> 05:25.473
And I'm staying in that house
until we get what we need.

06:04.881 --> 06:07.015
You ain't ask me why.

06:09.202 --> 06:12.654
Few of the others, even Miss
Georgia, they ask, but not you.

06:14.900 --> 06:16.491
Because I know why.

06:17.819 --> 06:19.694
Not the details,

06:19.729 --> 06:22.397
but I know something happened.

06:22.432 --> 06:24.242
Something unspeakable.

06:25.202 --> 06:27.068
And no one cared.

06:27.704 --> 06:31.039
And at first, you got incredibly sad,

06:31.333 --> 06:33.502
and then you got angry,

06:34.757 --> 06:36.880
and then you wanted
to destroy something.

06:49.238 --> 06:51.372
What happened to you?

06:53.296 --> 06:55.296
They shot my husband in the head.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.165
Right in front of me.

06:57.200 --> 06:58.566
The world made sense,

06:58.602 --> 07:00.487
and then in the blink of an eye,
it didn't.

07:03.306 --> 07:06.574
I'm still grieving, and I'm still

07:07.385 --> 07:09.410
furious.

07:09.913 --> 07:12.013
That ain't all though, is it?

07:14.050 --> 07:16.711
Now you know something
you can't un-know.

07:17.796 --> 07:19.721
Something niggers been knowin'
for a long time.

07:19.756 --> 07:21.656
All that sadness and anger in the world

07:21.691 --> 07:23.291
ain't nothin' compared to the...

07:23.326 --> 07:24.344
Fear.

07:28.565 --> 07:32.066
It's the only thing that's been
constant since they shot John.

07:33.870 --> 07:36.905
The idea that they could...

07:39.342 --> 07:43.144
Knowing that they can do,

07:43.179 --> 07:46.881
have done, and will do
whatever they want.

07:46.917 --> 07:49.317
That kind of fear can't sit.

07:49.352 --> 07:51.786
And it's only got two places to go.

07:51.821 --> 07:55.456
In... or out.

07:55.492 --> 07:58.159
I'm not sure which is better.

08:04.768 --> 08:09.270
Pull it in... then push it out.

08:11.074 --> 08:13.441
Get so scared
you got to scare them back.

08:13.476 --> 08:17.679
Become the monster that came to eat you.

09:50.407 --> 09:52.540
Pa!

10:38.096 --> 10:39.821
We got two days.

11:04.781 --> 11:06.047
Hello.

11:06.082 --> 11:07.382
Can I help you?

11:08.251 --> 11:09.651
I'd like a room.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.127
Is there a problem, ma'am?

11:21.931 --> 11:23.297
No.

11:23.333 --> 11:25.366
I just need a name for our records.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.969
John Hawkes.

11:32.734 --> 11:33.908
That's right.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.910
Been askin' around about you.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.879
Seems your husband
wasn't that smart, either.

11:37.914 --> 11:39.247
Got what he deserves.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.052
Get out.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.024
<i>We need to do something.</i>

11:49.059 --> 11:50.191
I know you're scared.

11:50.226 --> 11:52.326
I am not scared, I'm angry.

11:52.362 --> 11:54.295
And why aren't you?
He came into your house.

11:54.330 --> 11:56.631
And he walked right back out.
No one was harmed.

11:56.666 --> 11:58.744
- So you just want to ignore the threat.
- Well, of course not.

11:58.768 --> 12:00.713
But Rosalee's returning with
her family by week's end...

12:00.737 --> 12:01.836
Even more reason

12:01.871 --> 12:03.626
to make sure they never come back.

12:03.661 --> 12:06.340
We don't need any more attention
on this house, Elizabeth.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.209
Let it go.

12:09.946 --> 12:11.612
I don't understand.

12:12.065 --> 12:15.149
The first time I stepped in this
kitchen, you handed me a gun.

12:15.185 --> 12:16.951
To defend yourself,
should the moment arise,

12:16.986 --> 12:19.687
not to go looking for trouble.

12:19.723 --> 12:21.556
I know these type of men.

12:22.100 --> 12:23.369
My half-brother was one of them.

12:23.393 --> 12:25.793
They're bullies who make idle threats.

12:25.829 --> 12:28.162
He kidnapped me and tied me to a tree.

12:28.198 --> 12:30.031
And I wish that hadn't happened to you.

12:30.066 --> 12:32.400
I do.

12:32.819 --> 12:34.368
But it could have been worse.

12:34.988 --> 12:37.071
A lot worse.

12:37.574 --> 12:38.951
You walked out of those woods alive,

12:38.975 --> 12:41.109
but if it had been me...

12:42.746 --> 12:45.613
You wanted to know why I pass.

12:46.040 --> 12:50.086
It's because a sense of safety
transforms the spirit.

12:51.296 --> 12:53.508
Look, it's got you thinking
you're invincible.

12:54.440 --> 12:55.540
That's not fair.

12:55.575 --> 12:56.968
Maybe not.

12:57.343 --> 13:00.812
But any retaliation threatens
the safety of the runaways

13:00.847 --> 13:02.849
who come through this station.

13:03.883 --> 13:06.317
And that has to be our priority.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.839
My God.

13:27.874 --> 13:30.408
Georgia! Georgia, help!

13:33.713 --> 13:35.746
Stay with me.

13:53.199 --> 13:55.193
You ain't ask why.

13:56.803 --> 14:00.365
Few of the others, even Miss
Georgia, they ask, but not you.

14:02.408 --> 14:03.910
Because I know why.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.311
Not the details.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.247
But I know something happened.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.584
Something unspeakable.

14:12.819 --> 14:14.504
And no one cared.

14:15.338 --> 14:18.048
And at first, you got incredibly sad,

14:18.981 --> 14:21.010
and then you got angry,

14:22.220 --> 14:24.681
and you wanted to destroy something.

14:33.164 --> 14:34.539
What happened to you?

14:38.086 --> 14:40.044
They shot my husband in the head.

14:40.079 --> 14:41.656
Right in front of me.

14:43.324 --> 14:44.663
The world made sense,

14:44.698 --> 14:46.452
and then in the blink of an eye,
it didn't.

14:48.054 --> 14:51.791
I'm still grieving, and I'm still

14:52.392 --> 14:53.710
furious.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.427
That ain't all though, is it?

14:57.380 --> 14:59.430
Now you know somethin'
you can't un-know.

14:59.465 --> 15:01.832
Somethin' niggers been
knowin' for a long time.

15:01.868 --> 15:03.834
All that sadness and anger in the world

15:03.870 --> 15:05.403
ain't nothin' compared to the...

15:05.438 --> 15:06.681
Fear.

15:10.810 --> 15:14.078
It's the only thing that's been
constant since they shot John.

15:15.949 --> 15:19.083
The idea that they could...

15:21.567 --> 15:25.269
Knowing that they can do,

15:25.458 --> 15:29.093
have done, and will do
whatever they want.

15:29.128 --> 15:31.229
That kind of fear can't sit.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.931
And it's only got two places to go.

15:33.967 --> 15:37.768
In... or out.

15:37.804 --> 15:40.371
I'm not sure which is better.

15:45.812 --> 15:47.778
Pull it in...

15:48.531 --> 15:50.158
then push it out.

15:50.883 --> 15:53.317
Get so scared you got
to scare them back.

15:53.353 --> 15:57.555
Become the monster that came to eat you.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.155
Pa!

17:05.273 --> 17:07.058
Pa!

17:10.128 --> 17:11.962
Pa!

17:51.170 --> 17:53.637
This is what I was afraid of.

17:54.015 --> 17:55.973
What I thought we were both afraid of.

17:56.008 --> 17:57.608
That innocent people would be hurt.

17:57.643 --> 18:00.089
We're all complicit as long as
there's slavery in this country.

18:00.113 --> 18:01.627
That's John Brown's rhetoric.

18:01.662 --> 18:02.747
And it's true.

18:02.782 --> 18:03.814
Elizabeth,

18:03.850 --> 18:05.950
he's just a boy.

18:08.446 --> 18:10.354
He's his father's son.

18:10.390 --> 18:13.924
Raised to believe that owning
people is his birthright.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.826
He could have been different.

18:16.495 --> 18:19.230
And we may never know
because of your actions.

18:19.624 --> 18:23.169
You think I'm heartless, but I'm not.

18:23.836 --> 18:26.339
I feel so deeply.

18:27.006 --> 18:29.173
I look at this boy, and my heart breaks,

18:29.208 --> 18:31.008
just as it does
for every brutalized runaway

18:31.043 --> 18:32.321
that's come through your station.

18:32.345 --> 18:36.313
The difference is
you caused this boy's pain.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.516
You're crossing a line
you can't come back from.

18:38.551 --> 18:42.438
"A sense of safety
transforms the spirit."

18:44.523 --> 18:47.057
Then it reasons that the
counterpart should do the same.

18:50.096 --> 18:51.595
Love or hope...

18:51.697 --> 18:53.931
it's not what's gonna end this fight.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.217
Not even rage.

18:56.052 --> 18:57.386
It's fear.

18:58.237 --> 19:00.528
Total and unforgiving.

19:01.335 --> 19:03.191
It's the only thing that moves us.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.342
Until we all feel it,

19:06.671 --> 19:09.814
nothing is going to change.

19:11.609 --> 19:13.861
If that's what you truly believe,

19:15.188 --> 19:16.781
you're dangerous.

19:17.824 --> 19:21.058
And I can't have you staying
in my home anymore.

19:41.112 --> 19:42.779
Everything all right?

19:42.814 --> 19:44.214
Yes.

19:44.249 --> 19:45.518
No.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.192
One of the men who kidnapped Elizabeth

19:47.227 --> 19:49.171
walked right through the front door.

19:49.963 --> 19:52.066
He's gone now. She slapped him.

19:52.633 --> 19:54.051
Good girl.

19:54.635 --> 19:57.436
Do me a favor and don't tell her that.

19:57.471 --> 20:00.349
She doesn't need any more
encouragement towards violence.

20:01.075 --> 20:02.685
Were you able to get them?

20:11.018 --> 20:14.286
Tell Mr. Barnett to expect
me in a week's time.

20:14.321 --> 20:16.855
His funds will come from Mr. Still.

20:18.726 --> 20:21.026
The cargo with the burned face...

20:21.061 --> 20:22.394
Cato.

20:22.429 --> 20:24.529
How long he been here?

20:24.565 --> 20:27.418
Two days, I believe. Why?

20:28.461 --> 20:30.671
Something about him I don't trust.

20:31.305 --> 20:33.841
His answers come too easy
from his mouth.

20:34.575 --> 20:36.174
Keep an eye.

20:36.210 --> 20:37.511
I will.

20:45.552 --> 20:48.620
There's a lot of tension
across that river.

20:48.656 --> 20:50.956
There's bound to be
more patrols than usual.

20:50.991 --> 20:53.169
And it's a lot of ground to
cover in a short amount of time.

20:53.193 --> 20:54.537
But them catchers,
they be mostly focused

20:54.561 --> 20:55.761
on black folks headin' north.

20:55.796 --> 20:58.530
Still, traveling all that way alone...

21:01.268 --> 21:03.037
I ain't never alone.

21:03.871 --> 21:06.271
<i>Even when I'm by myself.</i>

23:14.701 --> 23:16.802
Hyah! Hyah!

23:19.706 --> 23:21.840
Hyah! Hyah!

23:57.711 --> 24:00.047
Mr. Still and Mr. Douglass...

24:02.091 --> 24:04.677
they say I need to tell my story.

24:05.586 --> 24:07.096
Even more.

24:08.722 --> 24:12.390
That my experience
will speak to the heart

24:12.426 --> 24:14.359
of what we tryin' to do.

24:14.979 --> 24:17.963
I've grown to respect them,
and I-I defer to them

24:17.998 --> 24:19.798
on the more public aspects of the cause.

24:19.833 --> 24:22.400
They've... proven to be

24:22.436 --> 24:24.369
thoughtful stewards of your word.

24:24.404 --> 24:28.240
Even if they ain't always use
your words.

24:28.275 --> 24:30.709
But what they askin' of me, Lord,

24:30.744 --> 24:33.445
I wrestle with one of your seven.

24:37.284 --> 24:38.685
The sin of pride.

24:40.462 --> 24:42.621
My story ain't no better or worse

24:42.656 --> 24:45.457
than any other breakin'
under the weight of bondage.

24:45.492 --> 24:47.058
I-I want to tell 'em no,

24:47.094 --> 24:51.062
that-that I deal in action, not talk.

24:54.868 --> 24:56.835
But the speakin' could bring money in.

24:56.870 --> 25:00.005
And the money equals lives,
and I can't short that sight.

25:11.218 --> 25:13.329
Them two men, they...

25:14.655 --> 25:17.458
they well-educated but foolish.

25:18.325 --> 25:20.892
Thinkin' 'cause you do one thing well,

25:20.928 --> 25:23.295
that you... that you could
get others to do it?

25:23.330 --> 25:25.463
The world don't work like that.

25:29.036 --> 25:30.804
At least how I understand it.

25:33.390 --> 25:34.739
And even if it did,

25:34.775 --> 25:38.843
even-even if one could teach courage...

25:38.879 --> 25:41.446
just pass it on like a bucket of water,

25:41.481 --> 25:44.883
maybe I ain't the right one to teach it.

25:47.754 --> 25:51.556
Maybe my time's best spent
like I been spendin' it.

25:53.393 --> 25:58.630
Alone and sure-footed,
doin' what I can do.

26:00.901 --> 26:02.519
Not tryin' to be...

26:04.371 --> 26:06.064
somethin' I ain't, Lord.

26:11.078 --> 26:12.446
General Tubman.

26:14.781 --> 26:17.015
That's what Captain Brown called me.

26:17.050 --> 26:18.452
General.

26:27.044 --> 26:28.393
Everything I done

26:28.428 --> 26:31.698
been through your will
and with my own two hands.

26:32.366 --> 26:34.733
I ain't never doubted you.

26:36.870 --> 26:38.539
Not ever.

26:44.344 --> 26:47.214
But I ain't sure I'm meant to lead.

27:21.131 --> 27:23.777
- This wasn't what we talked about.
- The money's all there.

27:23.934 --> 27:26.146
You said four runaways
ain't nobody be lookin' for.

27:26.181 --> 27:28.620
- I know, but the plan change.
- Word spreadin' fast.

27:28.689 --> 27:29.899
By noon, the whole county'll know

27:29.923 --> 27:31.423
y'all burned down your big house.

27:31.458 --> 27:32.624
And you branded.

27:32.659 --> 27:33.958
They think we headin' north.

27:33.994 --> 27:35.972
They never gonna suspect
we hidin' right next door.

27:35.996 --> 27:37.696
No. Y'all got to go.

27:37.731 --> 27:39.831
How many times you been paid
to keep runaways?

27:39.866 --> 27:41.266
A few, but...

27:41.301 --> 27:43.301
And how many times you been caught?

27:45.305 --> 27:47.005
We go, the money goes.

27:47.040 --> 27:48.973
And it look like you need it.

27:52.713 --> 27:54.612
Y'all stay away from the windows,

27:54.648 --> 27:56.548
and you stay quiet.

28:07.160 --> 28:08.912
This your idea of a safe house?

28:08.937 --> 28:10.804
'Cause I ain't feelin' very safe.

28:10.839 --> 28:12.539
Not with no white woman.

28:12.574 --> 28:13.907
White, black, she don't care.

28:13.942 --> 28:16.142
We ain't got nobody or nothin'.

28:16.178 --> 28:18.411
- She ain't turnin' us in.
- Says you.

28:18.447 --> 28:21.314
It don't seem like you got
the best judgment these days.

28:22.751 --> 28:24.395
And even if she don't tell,
that don't mean ain't nobody

28:24.419 --> 28:25.919
ain't gonna come lookin'.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.469
What then?

28:27.504 --> 28:29.055
This cabin backed up to the river.

28:29.091 --> 28:31.057
Only way in,
we can see out them windows.

28:31.093 --> 28:32.904
And there's a little boat
tied off just down the way,

28:32.928 --> 28:35.161
- we need to run.
- Harriet help me make the plan back.

28:35.197 --> 28:36.329
We follow it,

28:36.365 --> 28:38.700
we all gonna make it out of here.

28:55.859 --> 28:57.918
You feelin' all right?

28:57.953 --> 28:59.719
He fine.

29:01.590 --> 29:03.857
I think it's a boy.

29:06.762 --> 29:08.161
Noah, I really don't...

29:08.196 --> 29:09.629
Rosalee.

29:09.665 --> 29:11.500
Your brother wakin'.

29:16.939 --> 29:18.465
I'm gonna keep watch.

29:25.747 --> 29:27.814
Shh.

29:29.952 --> 29:31.918
Where Corra?

29:42.297 --> 29:43.797
Come on, let's git!

29:47.970 --> 29:49.069
Go get her.

29:51.974 --> 29:53.273
Right there!

29:54.743 --> 29:56.042
Damn it.

29:56.078 --> 29:57.377
Told you to get her in the leg.

29:57.412 --> 29:58.778
Dead or alive, we'll get a reward.

29:58.814 --> 30:01.114
Get her on the wagon.

30:01.149 --> 30:03.350
No! No!

30:32.848 --> 30:35.782
How much longer till we ain't
got to run no more?

30:35.817 --> 30:38.451
We gon' meet my friend
Harriet at the next station,

30:38.487 --> 30:40.653
and she gon' give us
tickets to take a train

30:40.689 --> 30:41.888
the rest of the way.

30:41.923 --> 30:44.576
We got to ride
in the bottom of that, too?

30:46.061 --> 30:47.227
Nah.

30:47.262 --> 30:49.763
You gonna like it. It's fast.

30:49.798 --> 30:51.064
How fast?

30:51.099 --> 30:53.933
It's faster than
any horse you ever seen.

30:53.969 --> 30:57.303
And you get to watch the whole
world go by out the window.

30:57.339 --> 31:00.006
You thought the plantation
was big? Just wait.

31:00.042 --> 31:03.143
Before you can even blink,
we'll be in Ohio.

31:03.178 --> 31:05.311
Is that where we're all gonna live?

31:10.118 --> 31:11.484
Maybe.

31:11.520 --> 31:15.155
Or maybe we catch
another train to Canada.

31:15.190 --> 31:16.990
That's as far north as you can go.

31:17.025 --> 31:20.093
There a town there
called St. Catherine's.

31:20.128 --> 31:22.962
Got a lot of nice families there.

31:22.998 --> 31:27.035
And plenty of room
to build a house for all of us.

31:29.384 --> 31:31.217
And Boo there. Remember her?

31:31.373 --> 31:32.605
Yeah.

31:32.641 --> 31:34.118
Well, then, you already
got a friend there.

31:34.142 --> 31:37.548
And now that you free,
you can go to school,

31:37.583 --> 31:39.179
learn how to read.

31:39.214 --> 31:42.082
Miss Suzanna was teaching me
how to read.

31:42.117 --> 31:43.683
That ain't the same.

31:43.718 --> 31:45.251
Why ain't it?

31:45.287 --> 31:47.454
Ain't nothin' seem different
now that I'm free.

31:47.489 --> 31:49.489
You can make your own choices now.

31:49.524 --> 31:51.958
In the big house, it might
have seemed like you could,

31:51.993 --> 31:53.927
but that was a lie.

31:53.962 --> 31:57.464
You was only allowed to have
what massa or mistress give you.

31:57.499 --> 31:59.032
Now I'm my own massa.

31:59.067 --> 32:00.767
That's right.

32:00.802 --> 32:04.337
So now you got to figure out
what kind of man you gonna be.

32:04.372 --> 32:06.908
What kind of choices you gonna make.

32:08.243 --> 32:11.377
'Cause every one of 'em
got consequences.

32:41.977 --> 32:43.943
Rose, she...

32:45.363 --> 32:46.613
she tells me

32:46.648 --> 32:48.450
that God talks to you.

32:50.160 --> 32:51.818
He does.

32:51.853 --> 32:53.789
What's he sound like?

32:54.256 --> 32:56.456
Like my old massa.

32:58.210 --> 32:59.826
Ain't that somethin'?

33:01.530 --> 33:03.064
Yeah.

33:03.967 --> 33:07.300
I want to believe in him. I do, really.

33:07.335 --> 33:09.262
But the things I seen?

33:10.205 --> 33:12.305
He ain't in none of it.

33:16.745 --> 33:18.538
What kind of trade you deal in?

33:20.015 --> 33:22.000
I'm a blacksmith.

33:23.960 --> 33:25.818
You remind me of my father.

33:25.854 --> 33:27.654
He was a timber inspector...
only trust things

33:27.689 --> 33:29.455
he could see with his own two eyes,

33:29.491 --> 33:32.058
hear with his own ears
and touch with his own hands.

33:32.828 --> 33:35.069
Problem is, that ain't
gonna see you through.

33:36.164 --> 33:37.764
It got me this far.

33:38.416 --> 33:39.966
Has it?

33:40.794 --> 33:43.169
She told me 'bout your Macon 7.

33:44.089 --> 33:45.104
600 miles...

33:45.140 --> 33:46.906
even with the help of the Underground,

33:46.942 --> 33:49.142
that's a hell of a feat.

33:49.719 --> 33:51.811
What made you think
you could pull that off?

33:51.846 --> 33:53.223
I didn't.

33:54.449 --> 33:56.249
I didn't pull it off.

33:56.284 --> 33:57.817
Only three of us made it.

33:57.852 --> 33:59.719
That ain't what I asked you.

34:01.590 --> 34:03.890
I knew I was supposed to be free...

34:03.925 --> 34:05.992
Why you think that?
Everything you see, touch, hear

34:06.027 --> 34:07.493
told you you wasn't.

34:07.529 --> 34:10.263
Travelin' that distance, bein'
chased every step of the way,

34:10.297 --> 34:11.397
any given day,

34:12.467 --> 34:13.952
that's crazy.

34:15.411 --> 34:16.703
And you just one man.

34:16.737 --> 34:19.505
I found a song that showed me the way.

34:19.541 --> 34:21.440
How you know that song
was gonna get you there?

34:21.476 --> 34:22.909
I didn't know. I...

34:22.944 --> 34:24.277
I didn't know.

34:24.312 --> 34:26.980
So why you think a blacksmith
like you could even do it?

34:27.014 --> 34:30.302
I don't. I don't know.
I just... I just believed!

34:35.322 --> 34:37.422
And that's what you done lost.

34:38.310 --> 34:39.726
That feelin'

34:39.978 --> 34:42.688
that impossible things be possible.

34:45.609 --> 34:47.065
And you got to find it.

34:50.170 --> 34:52.871
This war we fightin' need men like you.

34:55.677 --> 34:57.777
I'm 'bout to be a father.

34:57.812 --> 35:00.980
Don't make no sense to put
myself in that kind of danger.

35:01.016 --> 35:02.315
Ain't nothin' great ever happen

35:02.350 --> 35:03.850
based on fear or sense.

35:03.885 --> 35:06.386
You got to be desperate and insane.

35:09.357 --> 35:12.125
You got to believe.

36:04.279 --> 36:06.112
I'm sorry. No, you ain't.

36:06.147 --> 36:07.280
Yeah, I am...

36:07.315 --> 36:08.581
Stop!

36:09.709 --> 36:10.850
Stop lyin'.

36:10.885 --> 36:13.186
Just stop lyin' to me!

36:13.221 --> 36:15.855
You sat right there. Right there!

36:15.890 --> 36:18.624
You let me put that ring on your finger.

36:18.660 --> 36:20.827
And then I spent 600 miles
followin' you back,

36:20.862 --> 36:23.396
tryin' to figure out what I done
to make you so distant.

36:23.431 --> 36:24.530
What did I do?

36:24.566 --> 36:26.699
This whole time,
you ain't want me touchin' you

36:26.735 --> 36:28.503
'cause you was hidin'.

36:30.755 --> 36:32.016
You know, when I got
to that whippin' shed

36:32.040 --> 36:35.135
and I saw Bill comin' at you
with that brand,

36:36.386 --> 36:40.780
I ain't never been more scared
in my entire life.

36:41.182 --> 36:44.584
Till you said you was carryin' my child.

36:45.729 --> 36:47.286
My child.

36:47.322 --> 36:49.422
Mine. This is my child.

36:49.457 --> 36:51.391
That fear that hit me right then,

36:51.426 --> 36:53.159
it cut straight to the bone.

36:53.194 --> 36:55.767
I ain't never imagined
I could ever feel that.

36:55.802 --> 36:56.779
Ever.

36:56.815 --> 37:00.199
Or that your selfishness
would be the cause of it.

37:02.070 --> 37:04.303
What do you want me to say?

37:04.339 --> 37:06.038
I don't know what to say.

37:06.074 --> 37:08.074
He's my brother.

37:08.109 --> 37:10.143
I made the only choice I could...

37:10.178 --> 37:11.989
You was willing to sacrifice
our family for yours!

37:12.013 --> 37:12.945
No.

37:12.981 --> 37:14.614
I know it seem that way.

37:14.649 --> 37:15.915
But it ain't.

37:15.950 --> 37:17.150
I knew the risk.

37:17.185 --> 37:18.718
But I also knew that we could do it.

37:18.753 --> 37:19.919
"We"?

37:19.954 --> 37:21.854
Yeah, and we did, Noah. That's because

37:21.890 --> 37:24.223
- we can do anything...
- We ain't do this together!

37:25.160 --> 37:27.232
You put my baby in harm's way.

37:27.267 --> 37:30.263
And you tricked me
into helpin' you do it.

37:30.298 --> 37:32.442
You ain't give me no choice!

37:33.542 --> 37:34.918
You...

37:35.937 --> 37:38.337
Rose, you treated me like a slave.

37:39.199 --> 37:40.940
Noah...

37:43.845 --> 37:46.546
You just like your father.

38:05.158 --> 38:06.591
Was that Gabriel crying?

38:07.728 --> 38:09.327
They just took...

38:09.363 --> 38:11.463
ripped him from Miss Ginny's arms.

38:11.498 --> 38:13.365
They just hit Miss Ginny upside the head

38:13.400 --> 38:14.966
'cause she wouldn't shut up.

38:15.002 --> 38:17.702
Now they bringin' Gabriel
to one of them trader's wagons.

38:17.738 --> 38:19.304
There's two of 'em.

38:19.339 --> 38:21.172
- How many white men are there?
- Three.

38:21.208 --> 38:22.841
No, four.

38:22.876 --> 38:24.309
Three of them doin' the manhandling

38:24.344 --> 38:26.144
while one in the nicer
shirt talkin' to massa.

38:26.179 --> 38:27.379
I said get back!

38:28.482 --> 38:30.048
Shut up!

38:30.083 --> 38:31.349
Who got the lash?

38:31.385 --> 38:33.285
Nobody.

38:33.320 --> 38:36.054
Overseer just usin' it
to keep everybody back.

38:36.089 --> 38:37.889
That stable boy...

38:37.924 --> 38:40.225
I don't 'member his name,
but he got that look on his face

38:40.260 --> 38:42.627
like he madder than a rattlesnake.

38:42.663 --> 38:45.130
I think he 'bout to come at massa.

38:46.566 --> 38:48.333
Never mind.

38:48.368 --> 38:50.568
He backin' up now.

38:50.604 --> 38:52.704
And Miss Ginny...

38:52.739 --> 38:54.399
she just sittin' there.

38:55.208 --> 38:57.509
Ain't even cryin' or nothin'.

38:57.544 --> 38:59.444
It's like...

38:59.479 --> 39:01.112
I don't know.

39:01.148 --> 39:04.133
A-Ain't no words
for the look on her face.

39:14.494 --> 39:16.628
They gonna sell us, too, Daddy?

39:18.965 --> 39:20.699
They gonna split us up?

39:22.602 --> 39:24.569
I ain't gonna let that happen.

39:24.604 --> 39:26.638
What you gonna do?

39:30.477 --> 39:32.228
I don't know yet.

39:33.580 --> 39:36.981
Sojourner would run.

39:40.320 --> 39:42.253
Crawley's gone, too.

39:42.289 --> 39:44.032
Only nine of us left.

39:44.358 --> 39:48.313
I been... readin' about

39:48.348 --> 39:50.288
this John Brown.

39:52.099 --> 39:54.032
Papers say him and his
men causin' trouble

39:54.067 --> 39:55.467
all up and down the river.

39:55.502 --> 39:58.370
Means he might still be close by.

39:58.405 --> 39:59.904
- We don't know that.
- Massa does.

39:59.940 --> 40:01.573
And so do all the other massas.

40:01.608 --> 40:03.608
That's why they shippin'
everybody Deep South.

40:03.643 --> 40:05.377
You cross that river,

40:05.412 --> 40:07.852
and you ask the wrong person
the wrong question...

40:07.888 --> 40:10.448
Gettin' help is the only chance
this family has

40:10.484 --> 40:11.449
to stay together.

40:11.485 --> 40:12.751
Hand me my tools.

40:19.626 --> 40:21.259
Maybe...

40:21.294 --> 40:22.761
maybe you talk to massa.

40:22.796 --> 40:24.462
You know? You... you good at talkin'.

40:24.498 --> 40:26.331
And maybe he let us all stay

40:26.366 --> 40:28.686
on account of you bringin' in
money for him on the regular.

40:30.210 --> 40:32.580
And what?

40:34.958 --> 40:37.509
I tell massa,
"I'll be a real good nigger"?

40:37.544 --> 40:40.963
I'll tell him, "I ain't
gonna cause you no trouble"

40:41.647 --> 40:45.216
'cause I'm just blind and helpless."

40:49.022 --> 40:51.055
You don't think I'm helpless, do you?

40:51.091 --> 40:52.475
No.

40:54.246 --> 40:55.937
I know you ain't.

40:57.597 --> 40:59.764
I'm just... I'm just scared

40:59.800 --> 41:01.733
they gon' do somethin' to our baby.

41:02.485 --> 41:04.821
They already did somethin'.

41:05.806 --> 41:09.200
They keepin' him up in that
big house so we stay chained.

41:14.214 --> 41:16.815
Freedom always been the only answer.

41:19.553 --> 41:22.187
It ain't no less 'cause
that baby's up there.

41:24.157 --> 41:26.658
Ain't no less 'cause I lost my eyes.

41:26.693 --> 41:30.013
We just need to find it, soon,

41:30.497 --> 41:32.390
or we may never see it.

41:37.804 --> 41:40.171
What can I do?

41:40.207 --> 41:41.906
Love me.

41:43.243 --> 41:45.043
Pray for me.

41:47.948 --> 41:51.816
Be ready, in case I fail.

42:26.286 --> 42:27.418
Hyah!

42:40.600 --> 42:42.467
Whoa.

42:59.702 --> 43:01.736
I've been seeing a girl down in Ripley.

43:01.771 --> 43:03.738
Ripley?

43:03.773 --> 43:05.840
Yep.

43:07.510 --> 43:08.642
Is that possible?

43:13.216 --> 43:14.867
Pardon.

43:15.451 --> 43:17.370
I'm all out of sorts.

43:17.720 --> 43:19.153
Would you be so kind

43:19.188 --> 43:23.090
as to point me
in the direction of Ripley?

43:43.413 --> 43:44.813
How many times does one buy a roof?

43:44.847 --> 43:45.780
Should be expecting rain,

43:45.815 --> 43:47.281
but I can't move the wedding inside.

43:47.316 --> 43:49.283
I suppose we'll have to get
a canopy or something.

43:49.318 --> 43:51.318
I don't think so.
Maybe it was the gin talking,

43:51.354 --> 43:52.865
but I could not abide that kind
of talk around my lady.

43:52.889 --> 43:54.299
<i>It's called Orpheus in the Underworld.</i>

43:54.323 --> 43:56.390
Someone told me
that Harriet Beecher Stowe

43:56.426 --> 43:58.170
spent some time here
when she was writing it.

43:58.194 --> 43:59.805
And rumor has it,
more than one of the characters

43:59.829 --> 44:02.763
are loosely based on some of
the folks in the abolitionist...

44:02.799 --> 44:04.632
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

44:04.667 --> 44:05.866
Can I see your papers?

44:05.902 --> 44:06.902
I beg your pardon?

44:06.936 --> 44:08.636
Your free papers. I need to see them.

44:10.873 --> 44:13.040
Got my working papers right here, boss.

44:13.075 --> 44:15.075
I'm on loan to the university.

44:18.214 --> 44:20.347
University's miles from here.

44:21.200 --> 44:22.852
Yes, sir.

44:23.453 --> 44:25.252
I broke my tool bag.

44:25.288 --> 44:26.353
Boss was kind enough

44:26.389 --> 44:28.556
to let me find repair here in the city.

44:28.591 --> 44:30.658
If it ain't too much trouble,
could you point me

44:30.693 --> 44:32.359
in the direction of the nearest cobbler

44:32.395 --> 44:34.695
or someone experienced with leather?

44:37.867 --> 44:39.433
Should be like new.

44:39.469 --> 44:41.547
Just don't drag your feet
when you walk anymore, okay?

44:41.571 --> 44:43.103
That's what wears down the front.

44:43.139 --> 44:44.538
Thank you.

44:51.180 --> 44:52.546
How can I help you?

44:52.582 --> 44:54.949
I was hopin' you could
help me repair this.

44:54.984 --> 44:57.117
Well, let's take a look.

44:59.288 --> 45:01.255
I just read an article
about cobbler shops

45:01.290 --> 45:03.591
no more than a week ago.

45:03.626 --> 45:05.478
Find that hard to believe.

45:06.729 --> 45:08.606
My apologies.

45:09.357 --> 45:10.965
This is something that I had read

45:11.000 --> 45:13.133
before my recent accident.

45:13.169 --> 45:15.569
That article said that
Ripley, Ohio was unique

45:15.605 --> 45:17.171
in the fact that it had

45:17.206 --> 45:19.406
six cobbler shops. Six.

45:19.442 --> 45:23.811
Whereas most towns might have
maybe one or two. Is that true?

45:23.846 --> 45:25.546
That sounds about right.

45:25.581 --> 45:28.315
I remember reading... most
likely in that same article...

45:28.351 --> 45:31.652
something that suggested
there was a use for shoes

45:31.687 --> 45:33.554
for runaway slaves.

45:35.216 --> 45:36.857
I wouldn't know anything about that.

45:36.893 --> 45:38.759
I myself would never consider it.

45:38.794 --> 45:40.561
But then, it makes sense.

45:40.596 --> 45:43.130
We're lucky if the massa
gives us some hand-me-downs

45:43.165 --> 45:45.332
to make it back and forth
across the plantation.

45:45.368 --> 45:48.702
But at the end of the day,
and how much use can you get

45:48.738 --> 45:51.472
out of one pair of shoes?
50 miles of wear?

45:51.507 --> 45:53.140
200, if constructed properly.

45:53.175 --> 45:54.775
You sound like a man

45:54.810 --> 45:56.310
who knows his craft.

45:56.345 --> 45:58.612
I myself am a stone cutter.

45:58.648 --> 46:01.315
Although a less apt one, as of late.

46:01.350 --> 46:03.828
Okay. There you go.

46:05.955 --> 46:08.022
How much for the work?

46:08.291 --> 46:10.024
It's no charge.

46:13.996 --> 46:16.931
I'm looking for John Brown.

46:16.966 --> 46:19.533
I'm sure I do not know
who you're talking about.

46:19.569 --> 46:21.135
With all due respect, sir,

46:21.170 --> 46:22.803
I ain't got time for subterfuge.

46:22.838 --> 46:25.706
In fact, I ran out of time
a few days ago.

46:25.741 --> 46:28.769
Now I'm just a man who's
desperate to save his family.

46:29.520 --> 46:32.580
Now, hell, there are
six cobbler shops in this town.

46:32.615 --> 46:35.818
Now, maybe one or two of them
may be just be that, but...

46:36.986 --> 46:40.281
I have to pray
that I walked into one that...

46:41.691 --> 46:43.123
might be sympathetic.

46:43.159 --> 46:45.159
I'm not sure I can help you.

46:45.194 --> 46:46.860
I fix shoes.

46:46.896 --> 46:49.749
I don't bother myself with politics.

47:03.512 --> 47:04.812
Hold on a minute.

47:15.224 --> 47:16.984
Excuse me, sir?

47:22.218 --> 47:24.285
Can I help you?
