01:38.345 --> 01:41.712
Hold it, now keep
the tension on it, boys!

01:43.650 --> 01:45.618
Got to pull
it to the left.

01:45.652 --> 01:47.643
That's it!

02:13.146 --> 02:16.809
Wash-ee.

02:22.489 --> 02:24.252
Eat-ee.

02:27.794 --> 02:31.389
His dog
them eat-ee too.

02:32.666 --> 02:36.693
Or, eat-ee him yourself,
you leering heathen.

03:09.002 --> 03:10.526
Is this for me?

03:10.570 --> 03:12.936
Brought it for you.

03:18.311 --> 03:19.573
Get out.

03:26.720 --> 03:28.017
Pointed the gun
at him!

03:28.054 --> 03:30.147
Boom, shot him
right there!

03:30.190 --> 03:32.215
That's the guy
over there.

03:32.259 --> 03:35.285
Him and Wild Bill
got the guy right in the eye.

03:37.364 --> 03:39.889
You touch that
hoteI's kitchen, Seth?

03:47.607 --> 03:49.598
I'll meet you.

04:00.220 --> 04:03.621
Men like Mr. Seth Bullock
there raise their camp up.

04:03.657 --> 04:05.716
Yeah, fella to be
put in that box

04:05.759 --> 04:07.351
might argue with you,
Reverend.

04:07.394 --> 04:09.726
Mr. Bullock
did not draw first.

04:09.763 --> 04:11.822
And I point to his
commissioning me

04:11.865 --> 04:13.355
to build the departed
a coffin

04:13.400 --> 04:15.163
and see to his
Christian burial.

04:15.201 --> 04:17.930
Well, any idea
of the departed's name?

04:17.971 --> 04:21.771
In his effects I found
a letter addressed to Tom Mason.

04:21.808 --> 04:24.038
Well, I know
a Tom Mason.

04:24.077 --> 04:27.240
But that feller keeping cooI
in the creek, that ain't him.

04:27.280 --> 04:29.043
Which, having prayed,
I decided to open.

04:29.082 --> 04:31.880
The sender, Mrs. Walter
Mason writes,

04:31.918 --> 04:34.853
"I've asked your brother Ned
to bear this to you. "

04:34.888 --> 04:39.086
From which I conclude
the departed's name is Ned.

04:39.125 --> 04:40.854
Ned Mason, huh?

04:40.894 --> 04:44.022
Perhaps the Tom Mason
you know is the dead man's brother?

04:44.064 --> 04:47.090
If he is in camp
he should be notified.

04:47.133 --> 04:49.966
No, I ain't
seen Tom around.

04:52.272 --> 04:54.331
Coffee!

04:56.309 --> 04:58.140
Morning, Al.

04:58.178 --> 05:00.043
I'd like someone
to tell me what in fuck

05:00.080 --> 05:02.207
is going forward
in this camp?

05:02.248 --> 05:03.806
Tim Driscoll's
checked out.

05:03.850 --> 05:05.147
I can tell you
that much.

05:05.185 --> 05:08.052
- Left your hoteI, has he?
- Moved to Wu's pigsty.

05:08.088 --> 05:11.649
- What was that shootout about?
- At sun-up?

05:11.691 --> 05:14.524
- Yeah, fucking sun-up!
- Far as I heard, Al,

05:14.561 --> 05:17.553
Hickok and one of them hardware guys
you're renting to,

05:17.597 --> 05:19.428
threw down on the fella
brought word in

05:19.466 --> 05:21.331
of that squarehead
family's massacre.

05:21.368 --> 05:22.835
Suspected he was
in on the kill.

05:22.869 --> 05:25.429
What's it to Hickok
or that hardware guy either

05:25.472 --> 05:26.939
how them squareheads
come to die?

05:26.973 --> 05:28.668
I couldn't agree
with you more.

05:31.478 --> 05:34.743
If you don't stop dragging
that fucking leg...

05:34.781 --> 05:36.772
Coffee?

05:36.816 --> 05:38.681
I might have
one cup.

05:41.021 --> 05:42.989
Did you know one
squarehead lived?

05:43.023 --> 05:46.288
Little squarehead girI.
They took her to the doc's.

05:46.326 --> 05:48.453
- What condition?
- I don't know, Al.

05:48.495 --> 05:50.725
If she was to live,

05:50.764 --> 05:52.493
wouldn't she have
a story to tell?

06:31.037 --> 06:33.005
Wake up.

06:33.039 --> 06:36.133
- How's that little one?
- She's still among us.

06:36.176 --> 06:38.838
I'm asking you what
her prospects are?

06:40.580 --> 06:42.548
If her wounds
don't fester,

06:42.582 --> 06:45.244
she might can have
a fighting chance.

06:45.285 --> 06:47.253
Good.

06:47.287 --> 06:49.778
None of that
to him.

06:49.823 --> 06:51.791
Oh, he's all right.

06:51.825 --> 06:53.793
Not a word.

06:53.827 --> 06:55.954
- Morning.
- Morning, Bullock.

06:55.995 --> 06:58.361
I was wondering
how that child fared.

06:58.398 --> 07:00.491
Iffy. Touch and go.

07:00.533 --> 07:02.694
I'm not optimistic.

07:02.736 --> 07:04.363
Has she spoken?

07:04.404 --> 07:06.269
She's not conscious.

07:06.306 --> 07:09.139
Be surprised
if she ever is.

07:12.178 --> 07:14.806
I'd like to hear
whichever way it goes.

07:16.816 --> 07:19.341
If you see Bill Hickok,

07:19.385 --> 07:20.875
or that sore asshole,
Charlie Utter,

07:20.920 --> 07:22.854
could you tell him
I looked to the stock?

07:22.889 --> 07:25.084
Sure, I'll let him know.

07:25.125 --> 07:28.151
You're wrong
not to trust him.

07:28.194 --> 07:31.322
He formed a party that
found that little one

07:31.364 --> 07:33.093
among all the dead
of her family.

07:33.133 --> 07:35.693
Didn't he?

07:35.735 --> 07:39.535
And didn't he also shoot a man
he suspected in the murders?

07:39.572 --> 07:42.370
And if I were
to confide in him

07:42.408 --> 07:44.842
would he circulate my optimism?
I mean, wouldn't he say,

07:44.878 --> 07:47.608
"When the little one speaks,
you'll see I was right.

07:47.647 --> 07:50.343
Not the Sioux killed her family,
but road agents"?

07:50.383 --> 07:54.251
And supposing
it was road agents,

07:54.287 --> 07:56.585
and they hear his talk,

07:56.623 --> 08:00.184
where's the little one
stand then?

08:00.226 --> 08:03.354
You got a dark
turn of mind.

08:03.396 --> 08:07.924
I see as much misery outta them
moving to justify theirselves

08:07.967 --> 08:10.936
as them that set out
to do harm.

08:17.610 --> 08:22.047
Same dead roach
in the same damn biscuit.

08:22.081 --> 08:25.107
He stuck to
his position.

08:25.151 --> 08:28.120
- Morning.
- Morning, Montana.

08:34.727 --> 08:36.422
Yeah.

08:36.462 --> 08:40.261
- Joe?
- Much obliged.

08:40.299 --> 08:42.563
Your friend asked me to say
she's looked to your stock.

08:42.602 --> 08:43.864
Thanks.

08:43.903 --> 08:46.303
She's back now watching
over that child we found.

08:46.339 --> 08:49.706
Far as her chances,
the doc's not optimistic.

08:49.742 --> 08:51.710
From the look of him,

08:51.744 --> 08:54.212
think that doc's been wrong
once or twice in his life?

08:54.247 --> 08:57.683
Maybe once
or twice.

08:57.717 --> 08:59.844
We'll likely be by
your tent later.

08:59.886 --> 09:02.753
Get Bill here outfitted
with some prospecting gear.

09:02.789 --> 09:04.120
Yes, sir.

09:13.967 --> 09:16.299
Don't do that,
Charlie.

09:16.336 --> 09:19.169
- Do what?
- Trumpet my intentions.

09:19.205 --> 09:20.832
Herd me like
a damn steer.

09:20.874 --> 09:22.535
Ain't you here
to prospect gold?

09:22.575 --> 09:25.567
If you're just gonna gamble,
Bill, let's get it set.

09:25.612 --> 09:27.443
I'll arrange appearance
money for you.

09:27.480 --> 09:30.074
That ain't gambling.
It's shilling for the house.

09:30.116 --> 09:33.085
It's getting you a regular
damn source of income.

09:33.119 --> 09:36.316
So's this don't
wind up like Cheyenne.

09:41.094 --> 09:43.289
What offer should we make
at the purchase of that lot?

09:43.329 --> 09:47.265
Barber next to us
paid 600 for his lot 10 days ago.

09:47.300 --> 09:50.167
- Seller's market.
- Mm-hmm.

09:50.203 --> 09:53.536
I'd say we're well bought at 750,
we don't go past 1,000.

09:53.573 --> 09:57.737
Uh, may I, um,
join you?

10:03.650 --> 10:05.914
Well, Mr. Bullock,

10:05.952 --> 10:07.943
after the events
of last night,

10:07.987 --> 10:10.922
for an ink-stained
wretch like myself

10:10.957 --> 10:13.482
finding you
and Mr. Hickok here

10:13.526 --> 10:16.552
in the same dining room
is luck indeed.

10:16.596 --> 10:19.326
I don't want to talk about
last night's events.

10:19.365 --> 10:22.334
All right,
fair enough.

10:22.368 --> 10:25.769
I now pocket
my notebook, sir.

10:27.106 --> 10:29.597
The same wretched
biscuits.

10:31.945 --> 10:33.936
Mrs. Garret.

10:37.717 --> 10:39.878
I hoped you
slept well.

10:39.919 --> 10:41.352
As it happens,
I did not.

10:41.387 --> 10:43.548
I'm very sorry.
Do you require the doctor?

10:43.589 --> 10:45.318
Yes. Please.

10:45.358 --> 10:48.555
Certainly, ma'am,
of course.

10:48.594 --> 10:50.994
Sorry you're
poorly again.

11:08.414 --> 11:10.541
That is Mrs. Alma Garret.

11:10.583 --> 11:12.551
Whose husband,
I'm told,

11:12.585 --> 11:16.021
standing at the bar
at Swearengen's saloon

11:16.055 --> 11:20.856
purchased a gold claim
last night for $20,000.

11:20.893 --> 11:23.361
We rent our lot
from Al Swearengen.

11:23.396 --> 11:25.660
I'm not surprised
to hear it.

11:28.067 --> 11:31.503
Tim Driscoll,
the claim's seller,

11:31.537 --> 11:33.334
lives here
in this hoteI.

11:33.373 --> 11:35.364
He, uh...

11:35.408 --> 11:37.376
must be sleeping in.

11:52.492 --> 11:54.426
Do you mind?

11:56.963 --> 11:59.898
Morning, boys!

11:59.932 --> 12:01.729
- Good morning!
- Ellsworth.

12:01.768 --> 12:03.702
Name's Ellsworth.

12:03.736 --> 12:05.863
I hear you bought
these digs.

12:05.905 --> 12:07.770
Brom Garret,
how do you do?

12:07.807 --> 12:09.604
My claim's
next one over.

12:09.642 --> 12:11.007
I see.

12:11.044 --> 12:13.137
You cleaning up
any yellow?

12:13.179 --> 12:15.773
Day's young!

12:15.815 --> 12:19.114
How are things
running at your claim?

12:19.152 --> 12:22.315
Made my quota for whiskey,
pussy and food.

12:23.589 --> 12:25.955
Then you best get on down
to The Gem, Ellsworth.

12:25.992 --> 12:29.792
Further efforts'll only
benefit the faro dealers.

12:29.829 --> 12:34.095
This exact spot showed a fistfuI
of nuggets two nights ago.

12:34.133 --> 12:36.499
Well, don't weaken,
pilgrim.

12:36.536 --> 12:38.003
Nuggets are nothing.

12:38.037 --> 12:40.062
She's usually gonna
show you some flake.

12:42.809 --> 12:44.800
Thanks for
the encouraging words.

12:50.917 --> 12:53.647
She hasn't even
showed me any flake.

12:59.092 --> 13:00.957
Oh, hell.

13:03.563 --> 13:05.690
"Well, I doubt that,
Reverend," I say,

13:05.731 --> 13:08.928
"the Tom Mason I know
is nowhere near here. "

13:08.968 --> 13:10.663
But what I was thinking

13:10.703 --> 13:13.797
is damned if Al didn't
center shoot the bull's-eye.

13:13.840 --> 13:18.174
It wasn't Sioux
killed them squareheads.

13:18.211 --> 13:20.475
But it was
Persimmon Phil,

13:20.513 --> 13:24.609
Tom Mason and that croaker
headed for his coffin.

13:24.650 --> 13:27.175
Who's probably some fuck-up younger
brother of Tom's named Ned.

13:27.220 --> 13:29.518
Listen to me,
go get Doc Cochran.

13:29.555 --> 13:31.989
And I never tipped
the thumper to none of it, Al.

13:32.024 --> 13:33.457
Played it dumb
as a pile of rocks.

13:33.493 --> 13:37.122
Go get the doc.
Say I want him to see to the whores.

13:39.132 --> 13:40.599
All right, Al.

13:41.601 --> 13:44.035
'Scuse me, fella.

13:44.070 --> 13:45.560
Mr. Swearengen.

13:45.605 --> 13:47.038
Yeah, that's right.

13:47.073 --> 13:48.973
- SoI Star.
- Seth Bullock.

13:49.008 --> 13:50.475
Rent on lot four.

13:50.510 --> 13:52.535
Lot four?

13:52.578 --> 13:54.876
The hardware boys,
hmm?

13:54.914 --> 13:57.439
Here, I wanna buy you
fellas a drink.

13:57.483 --> 13:59.451
How's business
on that lot?

13:59.485 --> 14:01.146
Hell of a spot,
isn't it?

14:01.187 --> 14:04.384
Any more foot traffic
you'd have to call it a riot.

14:04.423 --> 14:07.517
Now, I'm turning
back slow.

14:09.195 --> 14:11.891
Nothing in hand
but this whiskey bottle.

14:14.667 --> 14:17.465
I heard you're not a man
I want mistaking my intentions.

14:17.503 --> 14:20.495
Who says that?
I'd like to ask 'em what they mean.

14:20.540 --> 14:23.134
- A fella drew on Seth this morning.
- Never heard different.

14:23.176 --> 14:24.939
No one mistook
his intentions.

14:24.977 --> 14:27.207
Let's leave it
all alone.

14:27.246 --> 14:29.874
I am stupidest
when I try to be funny.

14:34.220 --> 14:36.484
There you go, fellas.

14:37.890 --> 14:39.755
And these are
still free.

14:39.792 --> 14:41.760
Sorry for hitting
a nerve, huh?

14:41.794 --> 14:44.092
We'd like to make an offer
on that lot we're renting.

14:44.130 --> 14:45.722
Sell my back teeth
for the right money.

14:45.765 --> 14:47.323
Would 600
get the job done?

14:47.366 --> 14:50.392
I guess before I made
a price I'd want to know if you boys

14:50.436 --> 14:52.734
- have unnamed partners?
- Why?

14:52.772 --> 14:54.933
I think specifically
Wild Bill Hickok.

14:54.974 --> 14:56.839
Didn't you act together
this morning?

14:56.876 --> 14:58.639
We just met Wild Bill.

14:58.678 --> 15:00.873
What business
of that is his?

15:00.913 --> 15:02.380
You mean what business
of mine is that?

15:02.415 --> 15:04.906
Don't tell me
what the fuck I mean.

15:04.951 --> 15:07.385
Not a tone
to get a deal done.

15:07.420 --> 15:09.251
Can we sort it out
another time?

15:09.288 --> 15:11.279
Thirsty people coming.

15:13.392 --> 15:15.189
Sure.

15:15.228 --> 15:18.220
You and me will find
our proper stride.

15:18.264 --> 15:20.858
- All right.
- Good luck on the day's trade.

15:20.900 --> 15:23.698
Won't wish you luck. I can tell you
ain't the type that needs it,

15:23.736 --> 15:25.567
SoI Star, right?
That's a Jewish name.

15:25.605 --> 15:29.006
- Mine isn't, but nice to meet you, son.
- Pleasure.

15:29.041 --> 15:31.566
Marked you for an earner the minute
you come in my sight.

15:31.611 --> 15:33.374
Jew bastard.

15:35.915 --> 15:39.373
Ah, two wayfarers
when I'd heard you were three.

15:39.418 --> 15:40.817
How you doing, Al?

15:42.088 --> 15:44.147
Shall we all?
Let's drink upstairs.

15:44.190 --> 15:45.680
I can be persuaded.

15:45.725 --> 15:48.660
Will you have a whore, Tom, or you still
staying true to that heifer?

15:48.694 --> 15:50.525
It's over
'tween me and her.

15:50.563 --> 15:53.896
Old Tommy went sweet
on a buffalo down by Yankton.

15:53.933 --> 15:56.128
Where's brother Neddy,
anyway?

15:56.168 --> 15:57.897
Fuck if I know,
that fucker.

15:57.937 --> 16:00.098
I'll take her.

16:01.974 --> 16:03.908
Pick another.

16:03.943 --> 16:06.411
I don't like
that son of a bitch.

16:06.445 --> 16:08.106
Thank God you didn't
let him see it.

16:08.147 --> 16:10.638
Calls me loose with a gun.
Was he there?

16:10.683 --> 16:13.447
We'll just get the lot bought and have
nothing to do with him.

16:13.486 --> 16:15.750
Buy the lot and then
we'll give him wide berth.

16:15.788 --> 16:18.279
I've acted on your commission,
Mr. Bullock.

16:18.324 --> 16:21.259
- Built a coffin and dug a grave.
- Thank you.

16:21.294 --> 16:24.263
Will you join me,
now for the burial service?

16:27.933 --> 16:30.026
All I was saying, Bill,

16:30.069 --> 16:32.162
is till you start
your prospecting,

16:32.204 --> 16:34.934
if you're gonna gamble,
let's get you protected a little.

16:34.974 --> 16:36.601
I know what
you were saying.

16:36.642 --> 16:38.872
The extra business
you bring a joint,

16:38.911 --> 16:42.642
interruptions you stand for
or folks wanting to glad-hand,

16:42.682 --> 16:45.150
that all deserves
compensation.

16:45.184 --> 16:48.119
Don't shop me
to those places, Charlie.

16:50.156 --> 16:51.885
E.B. Farnum,
gentlemen.

16:51.924 --> 16:53.983
Mr. Utter's room
is ready.

17:05.104 --> 17:07.503
Clean
and thoroughly aired.

17:11.977 --> 17:14.036
The previous guest
was Irish.

17:17.717 --> 17:19.685
No tip necessary, sir.

17:19.719 --> 17:22.347
I operate the hoteI.

17:30.629 --> 17:33.063
I've replenished
your supply of medicine.

17:36.635 --> 17:39.695
Thank you, Doctor.

17:39.739 --> 17:41.969
I'm very gratefuI
for your attention.

17:42.007 --> 17:45.568
I only wish my symptoms
would subside.

17:45.611 --> 17:48.842
If I were to tell you that I would see
to your requirements,

17:48.881 --> 17:51.247
whether you had
symptoms or not,

17:51.283 --> 17:54.184
do you suppose

17:54.220 --> 17:55.983
that would help
you to heal?

17:56.021 --> 17:57.648
I don't know
what you mean.

17:57.690 --> 17:59.419
I believe you do,
madam.

17:59.458 --> 18:01.426
I believe we
understand each other.

18:01.460 --> 18:03.189
There are people
in this camp

18:03.229 --> 18:06.357
in genuine need
of my attention.

18:06.399 --> 18:09.926
Make this adequate
to your purposes

18:09.969 --> 18:11.596
for the next
several days.

18:11.637 --> 18:13.229
Well, thank you,
Doctor.

18:16.742 --> 18:20.109
Listen to Tom
carrying on in there.

18:20.146 --> 18:22.706
Bad luck he wasn't
here yesterday.

18:22.748 --> 18:24.443
Yeah, what'd we miss?

18:26.252 --> 18:28.413
Squarehead family
I could've tipped you to

18:28.454 --> 18:30.854
- heading back to Minnesota.
- Well off?

18:30.890 --> 18:33.381
Worth still trying
to catch, are they?

18:33.426 --> 18:34.950
Sioux already
caught up with them.

18:34.994 --> 18:37.292
Did them last night
on the road to Spearfish.

18:37.329 --> 18:39.490
Heathen cocksuckers.

18:39.532 --> 18:42.365
So we missed a good
score there, did we?

18:42.401 --> 18:44.062
Keep Iying

18:44.103 --> 18:46.628
and I'll murder you
in that chair.

18:52.978 --> 18:55.879
I'm gonna tell you
what happened, Al.

18:55.915 --> 18:58.315
And this is the God's
honest truth.

18:58.350 --> 19:00.875
We come on that family
by accident.

19:00.920 --> 19:04.447
Nobody was trying to hold out your end
or anything of the sort.

19:04.490 --> 19:07.152
Or to conceal
a goddamned thing.

19:07.193 --> 19:09.161
That's your end,
right there.

19:09.195 --> 19:11.186
Weighed to the ounce.

19:12.731 --> 19:15.632
My problem was we didn't
clear this with you.

19:15.668 --> 19:19.035
And you know
how you get, Al.

19:19.071 --> 19:20.936
I mean, you know
that yourself.

19:20.973 --> 19:24.932
But my problem
was bringing up the subject.

19:24.977 --> 19:26.706
But, uh...

19:26.745 --> 19:29.737
that's all weighed
out there.

19:29.782 --> 19:33.115
You know why I get
how I get?

19:33.152 --> 19:36.417
You wanna see over the job,
you don't like loose ends.

19:36.455 --> 19:38.116
- I appreciate that.
- Don't like messes,

19:38.157 --> 19:40.125
things done half-ass,

19:40.159 --> 19:41.922
bags of shit
left to hold.

19:41.961 --> 19:44.395
There's no loose ends,
I'll guarantee you.

19:44.430 --> 19:46.728
'Cause I got a whole
operation here to consider.

19:48.834 --> 19:51.302
Listen to Tom.

19:51.337 --> 19:53.567
One of the squareheads
lived.

19:55.875 --> 19:57.900
- No.
- No?

19:57.943 --> 20:00.207
I'm saying that's
pretty hard to believe.

20:00.246 --> 20:03.579
I believe you, but we seen to 'em
pretty good.

20:03.616 --> 20:05.948
They brought it to camp.
It's at the sawbone's.

20:05.985 --> 20:09.182
Is it talking?
Can it speak English?

20:09.221 --> 20:12.384
When we was seeing to 'em,
they was all screaming in squarehead.

20:12.424 --> 20:14.824
Where's Ned Mason?

20:18.063 --> 20:20.224
That's a fucking story
right there, Al.

20:20.266 --> 20:22.530
If you knew
the fucking problem.

20:22.568 --> 20:25.662
When it comes
the squarehead's time,

20:25.704 --> 20:27.171
he spooks
and runs off.

20:27.206 --> 20:29.174
Tom's and my hands
as full as they was,

20:29.208 --> 20:30.641
doing what we
had to do,

20:30.676 --> 20:32.837
so God knows where
he got off to.

20:32.878 --> 20:35.972
That's your cut there.
That reflects he's out.

20:36.015 --> 20:37.812
- There's no cut there-
- He came here.

20:39.051 --> 20:41.178
No.

20:41.220 --> 20:43.688
Say no again,
I'll murder you where you sit.

20:43.722 --> 20:45.713
He swore he'd head
to Cheyenne.

20:45.758 --> 20:47.385
Yeah, but here's closer,
isn't it?

20:47.426 --> 20:49.860
All you cocksuckers
go for the easiest chance.

20:52.531 --> 20:55.466
So, where is he now?

20:55.501 --> 20:58.629
Where he is now is he
stirs the whole camp up

20:58.671 --> 21:00.434
last night with
his massacre story

21:00.472 --> 21:02.940
till I'm giving liquor
away and cunt at half price

21:02.975 --> 21:04.602
just to keep
my crowd controlled.

21:04.643 --> 21:07.407
Party makes up from Nuttall's to ride
back out to Spearfish.

21:07.446 --> 21:10.415
Wild Bill Hickok and those two guys
walked past you downstairs

21:10.449 --> 21:13.077
save the squarehead kid,
tell Ned to stick around

21:13.118 --> 21:15.245
till they see what the kid
has to say about him.

21:15.287 --> 21:16.811
Wild Bill Hickok?

21:16.855 --> 21:19.915
And Ned throws down.

21:19.959 --> 21:21.654
Against Wild Bill Hickok?

21:21.694 --> 21:24.925
Against Hickok and this other cocksucker
who draws almost as fast.

21:24.964 --> 21:27.296
So it's a tossup
who blew Ned's head off.

21:29.802 --> 21:31.929
Christ, Al...

21:31.971 --> 21:35.634
I'm really
sorry for the bother.

21:35.674 --> 21:38.609
So you let Ned run,
you leave a squarehead alive

21:38.644 --> 21:41.477
and me to clean up the mess
and those are the only loose ends?

21:44.383 --> 21:46.317
I want you
to have my share.

21:46.352 --> 21:48.320
I swear to fucking
Christ, Al.

21:48.354 --> 21:49.981
I don't want
your fucking share.

21:50.022 --> 21:52.183
I don't want that kid
telling people in English,

21:52.224 --> 21:55.193
or squarehead or drawing pictures
in the shit with twigs

21:55.227 --> 21:58.390
about how it wasn't Indians
that killed her people but whites!

22:01.667 --> 22:03.635
This camp could
be up for grabs.

22:03.669 --> 22:05.830
God knows what these
cocksuckers are up to

22:05.871 --> 22:07.896
or what I'm gonna have
to do about it.

22:07.940 --> 22:09.840
Just when I need to keep
my head clear

22:09.875 --> 22:11.968
you give me these bags
of shit to hold!

22:12.011 --> 22:14.309
I should cut
your fucking throat, Phil!

22:14.346 --> 22:15.779
Please don't
cut my throat.

22:15.814 --> 22:18.214
Let me help you
straighten this out.

22:18.250 --> 22:20.741
That snatch
is branded!

22:25.557 --> 22:27.320
What happened?

22:27.359 --> 22:28.849
Tipped over.

22:28.894 --> 22:31.886
I'm helping him up.
Put your iron away now, Tom.

22:31.930 --> 22:33.454
Not yet!

22:33.499 --> 22:36.297
Branding at the flag!

22:37.569 --> 22:39.560
Doc?

22:41.340 --> 22:43.501
You'll get me
in Dutch with Al!

22:43.542 --> 22:45.134
Just another
damn moment!

22:47.279 --> 22:50.874
Don't put any pressure on it,
just lay it on light.

22:50.916 --> 22:53.214
It looks like
I'm pressing, I'm not.

22:54.853 --> 22:57.117
I'm not putting
any goddamned pressure!

22:57.156 --> 23:00.216
That's very good.
That's very good.

23:00.259 --> 23:02.989
Doc!

23:03.028 --> 23:04.723
I gotta go.

23:07.966 --> 23:10.730
I expect care for them
whore's business areas

23:10.769 --> 23:12.896
is a big damn part
of your income.

23:15.908 --> 23:17.899
This is what
you want me to do?

23:17.943 --> 23:20.138
Ah, yes.

23:20.179 --> 23:22.511
And don't
let anyone in.

23:22.548 --> 23:24.448
Believe me, anyone tries
getting in here

23:24.483 --> 23:26.576
who's not you is gonna be
damn fucking sorry.

23:26.618 --> 23:28.745
All right.

23:32.925 --> 23:35.120
I may not
let you back.

23:40.632 --> 23:42.862
Our Christ,
as He was crucified

23:42.901 --> 23:46.428
addressed the thief
who was hanging by His side.

23:46.472 --> 23:48.463
"Verily I say
unto thee, this day

23:48.507 --> 23:52.273
shalt thou be
with Me in paradise. "

23:52.311 --> 23:55.576
Your ways are not
our ways, O Lord.

23:55.614 --> 23:58.947
We abide the just
and the unjust alike

23:58.984 --> 24:00.417
under Your tearless eye.

24:00.452 --> 24:03.319
Tearless not because
You do not see us,

24:04.857 --> 24:06.882
but...

24:06.925 --> 24:09.393
because You see
what we are so well.

24:13.198 --> 24:16.099
Lamb of God, Who takest
away the sin of the world,

24:16.135 --> 24:19.502
send Your angels to welcome
this body into paradise.

24:19.538 --> 24:22.974
Lamb of God, Who takest away
the sin of the world,

24:23.008 --> 24:25.476
grant this souI
eternal rest.

24:25.511 --> 24:26.944
Amen.

24:26.979 --> 24:30.642
That's a real generous
perspective, Reverend.

24:30.682 --> 24:34.709
And don't we need all
the generosity we can get?

24:47.866 --> 24:49.925
They butt into
other people's business

24:49.968 --> 24:52.095
and make the business
of others their own,

24:52.137 --> 24:54.867
these bought-out
no-good cocksuckers.

24:54.907 --> 24:57.341
What, Hickok
you're talking about?

24:57.376 --> 24:58.968
Fucking bigshot
that he is.

24:59.011 --> 25:01.377
Big fucking shot
when he's standing in front of you.

25:01.413 --> 25:03.472
One in his ear
from behind, I'd like to see

25:03.515 --> 25:06.348
- how fucking tough he was.
- That's right. Cocksucker.

25:06.385 --> 25:08.649
Anyway, rest his souI.

25:08.687 --> 25:10.245
That's all.

25:10.289 --> 25:12.849
Condolences, Tom.

25:12.891 --> 25:14.950
He's gone, Johnny.

25:14.993 --> 25:17.291
I don't think
you ever did meet him.

25:17.329 --> 25:19.991
Ah, no.
Doc's here.

25:21.433 --> 25:23.401
Fuck Hickok!

25:23.435 --> 25:26.268
And what he did
to your poor brother, huh?

25:29.341 --> 25:31.070
This is festered

25:31.109 --> 25:33.475
because you won't take
a flame to your needle.

25:33.512 --> 25:36.072
I do, Doc, every time
before I use it.

25:36.114 --> 25:38.878
- Stop Iying.
- Anyways, I'm quitting.

25:38.917 --> 25:41.408
They say you're looking
to a little one, Doc.

25:41.453 --> 25:44.786
- How's that unguent working?
- It's nice and cooI on me, Doc.

25:46.391 --> 25:48.825
I'm trying just a little
bit more lanolin in it.

25:48.861 --> 25:50.829
Hey, give me
a dollop of that!

25:52.564 --> 25:54.532
How's that pussy
lotion feeI?

25:54.566 --> 25:56.625
Should I try
some on my ass?

25:56.668 --> 25:58.499
Al.

25:58.537 --> 26:00.004
Will she live?

26:00.038 --> 26:02.472
Let me look
at your belly.

26:02.507 --> 26:04.498
I didn't know
you cared, Doc.

26:04.543 --> 26:06.408
Will who live, Al?

26:06.445 --> 26:08.936
Norwegian kid.
How many children you caring for?

26:08.981 --> 26:10.778
I'm not optimistic.

26:10.816 --> 26:12.841
I see.

26:12.885 --> 26:14.477
Where are you
in your moons?

26:14.519 --> 26:16.612
- 'Bout two weeks along.
- She speak English?

26:16.655 --> 26:18.623
What's she gotta say
for herself anyway?

26:18.657 --> 26:21.558
She hasn't said a word
or been conscious for a second.

26:21.593 --> 26:23.584
Oh, too bad.

26:23.629 --> 26:27.190
She could settle who killed her people,
road agents or Sioux.

26:27.232 --> 26:29.666
I don't know nothing about that.
Does that hurt?

26:29.701 --> 26:33.034
- Little bit.
- If she does see, that's the point.

26:33.071 --> 26:34.902
She could settle it.

26:34.940 --> 26:37.238
I doubt she'll
settle anything.

26:37.276 --> 26:39.870
I doubt we'll even know
what language she spoke.

26:42.814 --> 26:46.341
Give these girls
a good going over, Doc.

26:46.385 --> 26:48.353
Look to 'em like
they're your own.

26:48.387 --> 26:51.288
Don't tell me my job
or how long to do it in.

26:51.323 --> 26:54.383
I can see to them
and I can see to the way

26:54.426 --> 26:58.089
I'm goddamned able,
and that is all I can goddamned do!

26:58.130 --> 27:00.826
Oh, what's your time
of the month, huh?

27:10.208 --> 27:12.108
Are you poorly, Doc?

27:12.144 --> 27:14.977
Don't worry about me,
I know what I am.

27:15.013 --> 27:17.174
What I'm not.

27:33.932 --> 27:35.422
What do you want?

27:38.036 --> 27:40.436
Doc asked me
to see your patient.

27:40.472 --> 27:42.963
What for?
What do you know about it?

27:43.008 --> 27:44.600
Who the fuck
are you?

27:48.747 --> 27:50.977
Hey, don't you
fucking ignore me!

27:52.684 --> 27:54.811
You don't want
to interfere with me.

27:54.853 --> 27:57.583
- Think I'm scared of you?
- Sure you are.

27:57.622 --> 27:59.749
If I take
a knife to you,

27:59.791 --> 28:02.282
you'll be scared worse
and a long time dying.

28:02.327 --> 28:04.158
I ain't scared
to die.

28:04.196 --> 28:05.686
I ain't scared
of nobody.

28:10.135 --> 28:12.228
Get away from her!

28:13.972 --> 28:16.304
Le- leave-

28:16.341 --> 28:18.536
Leave that little
one alone!

28:18.577 --> 28:21.011
- Leave her alone!
- Hello.

28:21.046 --> 28:24.140
Leave her!
Leave-

28:24.182 --> 28:26.582
Leave her alone,
you cocksucker!

28:29.521 --> 28:31.352
Do it to me
if you have to!

28:31.390 --> 28:33.415
Why would
I do it to you?

29:02.354 --> 29:04.219
Did you hurt her?

29:04.256 --> 29:06.520
No.

29:06.558 --> 29:08.651
No, Doc.

29:08.693 --> 29:10.684
But she's better
than you thought.

29:10.729 --> 29:13.129
Her eyes are open.

29:33.852 --> 29:35.581
I fell apart.

29:35.620 --> 29:38.316
I couldn't look out
for the little one.

29:38.356 --> 29:41.189
Fucker looked at me

29:41.226 --> 29:42.921
and I fell apart
in front of him.

29:44.262 --> 29:45.991
All right.

29:48.700 --> 29:50.930
You're not the first.

29:50.969 --> 29:53.062
No, I'm not the first.

29:53.105 --> 29:55.073
Who said I was
the first?

29:55.107 --> 29:57.200
You think he's
the fucking first?

29:57.242 --> 29:59.005
I've been fucked
plenty!

29:59.044 --> 30:00.773
And tougher fucks
than he was

30:00.812 --> 30:02.939
and littler
than her by plenty!

30:02.981 --> 30:06.314
They fucked me plenty!
So you can go fuck yourself!

30:14.593 --> 30:16.686
Go on, head out.

30:16.728 --> 30:18.719
I'll look after her.

30:22.033 --> 30:23.500
Was he a road agent?

30:23.535 --> 30:26.299
Was he among them
that did for her family?

30:26.338 --> 30:28.738
He owns The Gem Saloon.

30:28.773 --> 30:31.139
Then what's it to him
if she can open her eyes?

30:31.176 --> 30:32.609
You go on ahead.

30:32.644 --> 30:34.578
Does road agents
work for him?

30:34.613 --> 30:36.774
I'll take care
of her.

30:53.565 --> 30:55.055
I'm sorry.

30:55.100 --> 30:57.125
I apologize.

30:57.169 --> 30:59.160
You got nothing
to apologize for.

30:59.204 --> 31:00.933
You gotta gift
for this.

31:00.972 --> 31:03.031
You cared
for her real good.

31:03.074 --> 31:06.407
- Don't be mean.
- No.

31:06.444 --> 31:08.435
You got a gift.

31:31.670 --> 31:33.297
Mr. Garret?

31:33.338 --> 31:35.806
How was your day
at the digs?

31:35.840 --> 31:38.138
It was a mixed experience,
Mr. Farnum.

31:38.176 --> 31:40.838
My claim retains every
bit of its promise,

31:40.879 --> 31:43.006
but I'm afraid
I've injured my back.

31:43.048 --> 31:44.879
All that twisting
and turning.

31:44.916 --> 31:47.214
It's wrenched at least
and I feeI worse.

31:47.252 --> 31:50.380
I may not be cut out
for this sort of activity.

31:50.422 --> 31:53.050
Oh, many aren't.

31:53.091 --> 31:56.583
Under the circumstances,
perhaps I should reconsider.

31:56.628 --> 31:58.596
What, sir?

31:58.630 --> 32:01.224
I refer to your offer
on my gold claim.

32:01.266 --> 32:03.131
My offer?

32:03.168 --> 32:05.693
Last night, Mr. Farnum,
before witnesses

32:05.737 --> 32:08.331
at The Gem Saloon
you offered 16,000.

32:08.373 --> 32:09.897
I see.

32:09.941 --> 32:12.569
I'm prepared
to reconsider.

32:14.045 --> 32:16.445
I have a confession
to make, Mr. Garret.

32:16.481 --> 32:17.971
I have a weakness
for spirits.

32:19.150 --> 32:21.118
You saying you were
drunk last night?

32:21.152 --> 32:22.346
I must've been, sir.

32:22.387 --> 32:25.015
I black out and no memory
at all of my actions.

32:25.056 --> 32:28.321
Please ignore any offers
made while in my condition.

32:28.360 --> 32:30.851
And yet you didn't
seem drunk.

32:30.895 --> 32:35.332
I suppose that's why
I'm such a danger to myself.

32:53.184 --> 32:54.811
Jesus Christ Almighty, Al.

32:54.853 --> 32:57.879
Far as that sewer-mouth
friend of Hickok's playing nurse,

32:57.922 --> 33:00.220
you can tip her over
with a feather.

33:00.258 --> 33:02.453
But a little girI?

33:02.494 --> 33:05.156
It's hard
on my conscious.

33:05.196 --> 33:08.290
We could let her spread word
that folks got road agents

33:08.333 --> 33:11.268
to fear more than Indians.
Breed mistrust, one white for another

33:11.303 --> 33:14.238
throughout the camp.
That'd be another option. Is he ready?

33:14.272 --> 33:16.365
Tom's ready,
but he's awfuI drunk.

33:16.408 --> 33:19.343
I don't trust him
to pull it off.

33:19.377 --> 33:21.971
Not a bank job. He walks up
to the cocksucker, puts one in his ear.

33:22.013 --> 33:23.947
He keeps running
that mouth like he is,

33:23.982 --> 33:26.450
Hickok ain't gonna
let him get close enough.

33:26.484 --> 33:28.850
Who in fuck is it?

33:28.887 --> 33:31.048
Them hardware guys is asking
for you downstairs.

33:33.758 --> 33:35.749
Tell 'em I'll be
fucking down.

33:37.829 --> 33:40.059
Pour coffee down Tom,
'cause he is going out

33:40.098 --> 33:41.895
tonight to murder that
son of a bitch.

33:41.933 --> 33:44.561
Where do you
and me stand?

33:46.504 --> 33:48.165
We're all right.

33:54.179 --> 33:55.942
What are you
supposed to do?

33:58.350 --> 33:59.977
Nothing.

34:00.018 --> 34:03.852
Don't ever say
nothing to no one.

34:05.957 --> 34:08.391
I don't know if you
can understand me,

34:08.426 --> 34:10.417
but if you can,
don't show it.

34:15.867 --> 34:18.859
If you gotta talk,
talk like that.

34:50.068 --> 34:52.127
See if this makes
sense to you, Seth.

34:53.371 --> 34:55.362
I do the talking.

34:55.407 --> 34:57.204
Fine with me.

34:57.242 --> 34:58.937
Some people
don't get along.

34:58.977 --> 35:01.639
They have business to do,
they find a way around it.

35:01.679 --> 35:03.647
Don't talk to me
like I'm five.

35:03.681 --> 35:05.842
- Boys.
- Evening.

35:05.884 --> 35:07.351
SoI's got my proxy.

35:07.385 --> 35:09.546
Me and him,
we should talk without you?

35:09.587 --> 35:11.521
That's what it means.

35:15.226 --> 35:17.456
What's your partner
so mad about all the time?

35:17.495 --> 35:20.987
- He's not mad.
- He's got a mean way of being happy.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.332
Far as offering
on your lot,

35:24.369 --> 35:26.166
we'd probably
go 750.

35:26.204 --> 35:28.229
You'd probably go
1,000.

35:28.273 --> 35:31.140
Say we would.
Does 1,000 get it done?

35:31.176 --> 35:34.168
My concern, SoI.

35:34.212 --> 35:36.874
- You don't mind if I call you SoI?
- Please do.

35:36.915 --> 35:39.406
My concern, anything can happen
under a tent.

35:39.451 --> 35:42.443
A hardware operation can turn
into a gambling joint,

35:42.487 --> 35:44.648
- ain't that right?
- That's not gonna happen.

35:44.689 --> 35:47.021
Sell to you boys outright,
I could be installing

35:47.058 --> 35:49.322
my own eventuI competition
in a prime location,

35:49.360 --> 35:51.351
with the A number one
man killer in the West

35:51.396 --> 35:53.091
holding an unnamed
piece of the action.

35:53.131 --> 35:56.100
We met Hickok by coincidence.
He's not an unnamed partner.

35:56.134 --> 35:59.331
So you say.
But a camp like this,

35:59.370 --> 36:02.533
no law
or enforceable contract.

36:02.574 --> 36:04.599
You gotta watch
a man a while

36:04.642 --> 36:06.610
till you see what
his word counts for.

36:06.644 --> 36:08.612
Would you like
some company?

36:08.646 --> 36:10.409
No.

36:12.150 --> 36:15.176
Say we value the lot
at 1,000,

36:15.220 --> 36:18.485
you boys give me 500 and whatever
you should put that tent to

36:18.523 --> 36:21.151
between now and the first snow.
I'm in for half the net.

36:21.192 --> 36:24.161
Come October, we finish the deal
knowing each other better.

36:24.195 --> 36:27.790
Seth won't accept it,
Mr. Swearengen.

36:27.832 --> 36:29.527
I thought you had
his proxy.

36:29.567 --> 36:31.000
Just up to a point.

36:31.035 --> 36:33.265
See, that ain't
my sense of proxy.

36:33.304 --> 36:35.295
That's what I'd want
these few months for

36:35.340 --> 36:36.967
till we agreed
what things meant.

36:37.008 --> 36:40.000
I'm telling you,
we're a hardware operation.

36:40.044 --> 36:41.807
You heard my offer.

36:53.391 --> 36:56.519
He didn't wanna drink
and he didn't wanna fuck.

36:56.561 --> 36:58.256
Anyone or just you?

37:00.064 --> 37:03.124
We pay 500 now. He gets 50%
of our net till the first snow.

37:03.167 --> 37:05.533
- Then buy out the rest of his interest.
- No.

37:05.570 --> 37:07.834
It's a great location.
He wants to be sure

37:07.872 --> 37:09.999
we don't turn to gambling
or that Hickok's with us.

37:10.041 --> 37:12.635
- I won't be partners.
- We wouldn't be after October.

37:12.677 --> 37:15.669
I won't be partners.

37:15.713 --> 37:18.011
Trixie.

37:18.049 --> 37:20.415
See, you got Trixie
all distressed.

37:20.451 --> 37:22.385
- She wanted to give you a ride.
- 1,000, now!

37:22.420 --> 37:25.321
If anyone in that tent
or the building we put up

37:25.356 --> 37:27.153
turns a playing card,
or pours a drink,

37:27.191 --> 37:30.786
or offers a woman's services, you get
title back and keep our money.

37:30.828 --> 37:34.389
What makes you talk to me
in that tone of voice?

37:34.432 --> 37:36.764
I'm making
a counter-offer.

37:36.801 --> 37:39.201
You come into camp,
rent my lot,

37:39.237 --> 37:41.501
within six hours,
you blow in a guy's eye

37:41.539 --> 37:43.530
with Wild Bill Hickok
backing your play.

37:43.575 --> 37:45.702
Next day I'm supposed
to sell you the lot,

37:45.743 --> 37:49.076
put you in business
without asking who you are

37:49.113 --> 37:51.843
or what you're doing here?

37:51.883 --> 37:53.851
Far as what happened
in the street

37:53.885 --> 37:55.750
with Bill Hickok
being involved,

37:55.787 --> 37:57.846
that was a turn
of events.

37:57.889 --> 37:59.447
A what?

37:59.490 --> 38:02.118
It was a turn
of events.

38:02.160 --> 38:04.128
Oh, a turn of events.

38:04.162 --> 38:06.653
Your partner calls
it a coincidence.

38:06.698 --> 38:09.428
So what with this coincidence
and turn of events

38:09.467 --> 38:12.095
staring me in the face
and five other things

38:12.136 --> 38:14.502
I'm supposed to be paying
attention to,

38:14.539 --> 38:16.507
I still make you
a sensible proposal

38:16.541 --> 38:18.771
and you answer
by insulting me in my own joint.

38:18.810 --> 38:20.175
Seth didn't mean
to insult you.

38:20.211 --> 38:22.008
You don't know
nothing about this.

38:22.046 --> 38:24.173
You weren't here,
you don't have his proxy.

38:24.215 --> 38:27.207
So do whatever you people do when
you're not running your mouths off

38:27.251 --> 38:29.742
or cheating people out
of what they earn by Christian work.

38:29.787 --> 38:32.779
- You don't wanna be talking that way.
- Don't tell me how to talk

38:32.824 --> 38:34.917
in my own fucking
place!

38:34.959 --> 38:38.554
And here's my counter-offer
to your counter-offer.

38:38.596 --> 38:41.622
Go fuck yourself!

38:43.301 --> 38:45.098
Come here, Seth.

38:48.740 --> 38:50.537
Seth.

38:50.575 --> 38:52.873
Get him away
from me.

38:52.910 --> 38:55.140
Mister.

38:55.179 --> 38:58.512
The best bath
and blowjob you ever had's

38:58.549 --> 39:00.540
not 12 steps
up them stairs.

39:03.354 --> 39:05.288
Mister!

39:13.064 --> 39:15.032
I may as well
confide in you, Alma.

39:15.066 --> 39:16.658
Of course.

39:16.701 --> 39:18.794
I'm beginning to feeI
we've been duped.

39:18.836 --> 39:20.736
Our gold claim
may be worthless.

39:20.772 --> 39:23.206
I'm beginning
to think that even

39:23.241 --> 39:25.801
Swearengen's name should be added
to the conspirators' list.

39:25.843 --> 39:29.540
- How disappointed you must be.
- I know.

39:29.580 --> 39:32.105
I told you I'd believed
I'd found a friend in Al.

39:32.150 --> 39:34.015
As I now look back,

39:34.052 --> 39:36.714
Al not only presided
the sale,

39:36.754 --> 39:39.382
he facilitated my involvement
at every turn.

39:39.424 --> 39:42.052
Well, I suppose
a community such as this

39:42.093 --> 39:45.722
attracts a certain
kind of man.

39:45.763 --> 39:50.700
I've mentioned to you
exchanging hellos

39:50.735 --> 39:53.169
with Wild Bill Hickok
in the hoteI hallway?

39:53.204 --> 39:56.230
Yes, you said he seemed
very friendly.

39:56.274 --> 39:59.641
Very friendly.
In the hallway and on the stairs.

39:59.677 --> 40:03.579
Do you suppose
we might enlist him to our cause?

40:03.614 --> 40:07.414
Do you think that that's
the sort of thing he does?

40:07.452 --> 40:11.183
For a fee, a percentage
of the monies recovered,

40:11.222 --> 40:13.816
I'd say that's
exactly his line.

40:13.858 --> 40:15.826
Hmm.

40:15.860 --> 40:19.819
I may well include
the name of Al Swearengen

40:19.864 --> 40:21.525
when Wild Bill
and I confer.

40:21.566 --> 40:24.763
This camp is
a going concern.

40:24.802 --> 40:26.736
We could secure
our futures here.

40:26.771 --> 40:29.262
- Hardware could just be a start.
- Camp needs a bank.

40:29.307 --> 40:32.208
Camp also needs a bank
is exactly right.

40:32.243 --> 40:34.871
Seth.

40:34.912 --> 40:37.039
If you see all
these possibilities

40:37.081 --> 40:39.140
why get sidetracked
by that saloon-keeper?

40:39.183 --> 40:41.981
We just wanna
buy his lot.

40:42.019 --> 40:43.850
What about what
he called you?

40:43.888 --> 40:45.879
I been called
worse by better.

40:48.126 --> 40:50.788
Get it in writing
from that son of a bitch.

40:50.828 --> 40:52.819
We buy the other half
in October.

40:52.864 --> 40:55.799
Just leave it to me.

41:02.540 --> 41:05.202
- Evening.
- Evening.

41:07.578 --> 41:09.978
Bill and me didn't
make it to your tent today.

41:10.014 --> 41:12.141
Tomorrow's another day.

41:12.183 --> 41:14.447
Prospect.

41:14.485 --> 41:18.216
His express purpose
coming to this camp.

41:18.256 --> 41:21.453
Make a stake
for his new wife.

41:21.492 --> 41:24.052
His idea.

41:24.095 --> 41:27.826
Don't suggest
buying a shoveI or a sifting cradle.

41:27.865 --> 41:29.025
Huh-uh.

41:30.935 --> 41:34.166
Ah, uh-oh.
Ah.

41:34.205 --> 41:37.072
Anyways,
have a good evening.

41:38.376 --> 41:40.867
What's your secret,
Bullock?

41:40.912 --> 41:42.641
What do you mean?

41:42.680 --> 41:45.547
You got some
of Bill's qualities

41:45.583 --> 41:48.017
but then you got
something he's missing.

41:48.052 --> 41:51.715
Get along with people,
turn a dollar,

41:51.756 --> 41:54.953
look out for yourself.

41:54.992 --> 41:56.960
He don't know
how to do that.

41:56.994 --> 41:58.894
You see what I'm saying?

41:58.930 --> 42:01.990
I like to know your secret

42:02.033 --> 42:03.728
so's then I can tell it
to Bill.

42:03.768 --> 42:06.168
I don't know
any secrets.

42:06.204 --> 42:07.796
Don't tell me
if you don't want.

42:07.839 --> 42:10.399
Find occasion
and tell him yourself.

42:10.441 --> 42:12.102
He likes you.

42:13.477 --> 42:15.672
Just don't
wait too long.

42:28.459 --> 42:31.917
- How you feeI?
- One more shot,

42:31.963 --> 42:34.932
and I'll be ready
to take that cocksucker.

42:34.966 --> 42:37.935
Maybe one more cup
of coffee.

42:45.376 --> 42:48.004
I'm out for a couple.

42:48.045 --> 42:50.605
Go get you some
more ammo Wild Bill.

42:50.648 --> 42:52.240
That kinda looks
down to turn.

42:52.283 --> 42:54.751
- Your name's Jack?
- Yeah, that's correct.

42:54.785 --> 42:56.844
What are you in the game
for, Jack?

42:56.888 --> 42:59.118
What am I
in it for?

42:59.156 --> 43:02.250
If irritating me's the jackpot,
you've got the job done.

43:09.333 --> 43:11.631
Montana.

43:11.669 --> 43:13.967
- Evening.
- Evening.

43:15.539 --> 43:19.031
What'd be your opinion
far as me getting another 50?

43:19.076 --> 43:21.203
You want another 50
in credit?

43:21.245 --> 43:23.577
If that's all right
with you?

43:23.614 --> 43:26.174
Yeah, I suppose so.

43:28.619 --> 43:31.611
- Play poker?
- I'm no good at it.

43:31.656 --> 43:34.955
You let that
slow you down?

43:34.992 --> 43:38.223
Fella in the far corner to your right
intends me harm.

43:38.262 --> 43:40.924
When he makes his move,

43:40.965 --> 43:43.900
would you keep an eye
on the man with him?

43:47.171 --> 43:48.468
You bet.

43:48.506 --> 43:50.167
See the fella's I mean?

43:50.207 --> 43:51.834
Yes, I do.

43:51.876 --> 43:54.436
Thanks, Montana.

43:54.478 --> 43:56.912
Wouldn't want
the water

43:56.948 --> 43:58.939
getting no deeper
than this, Mr. Hickok.

43:58.983 --> 44:00.974
Fair enough.

44:02.086 --> 44:04.520
Stand away
from me, SoI.

44:10.761 --> 44:13.525
Don't be too stupid,
Jack.

44:15.366 --> 44:17.698
I restored
our bosoms!

44:21.238 --> 44:24.264
- They throw you out?
- No, they did not!

44:24.308 --> 44:27.334
I left on my own stand.

44:27.378 --> 44:29.471
I choose
to be out here.

44:29.513 --> 44:32.676
Well I was drinking down
by the goddamned creek

44:32.717 --> 44:34.878
outta my own
fucking free will.

44:38.889 --> 44:40.550
Where's Bill?

44:40.591 --> 44:42.320
Inside,

44:42.360 --> 44:44.726
losing at cards.

44:44.762 --> 44:47.663
I'd go get him
but he'd accuse me

44:47.698 --> 44:50.189
of herding him
like a damn steer.

44:57.341 --> 44:59.866
Someone I need
to go kill.

45:00.978 --> 45:02.536
What, who?

45:02.580 --> 45:06.277
You are not my target,
but keep bothering me

45:06.317 --> 45:08.285
and I'll add you
to the list.

45:08.319 --> 45:10.844
Who we talking
about, damn it!?

45:10.888 --> 45:13.254
Greasy-haired
limey cocksucker

45:13.290 --> 45:15.758
that runs
The Gem Saloon.

45:15.793 --> 45:19.559
What the hell
you wanna kill him for?

45:19.597 --> 45:22.293
For showing me
two different things

45:22.333 --> 45:24.267
between the coward

45:24.301 --> 45:26.997
and the lapse
of momentary fear.

45:27.038 --> 45:28.767
Listen, Jane!
You listen to me!

45:28.806 --> 45:31.172
I don't know what
you're talking about.

45:31.208 --> 45:33.642
I guaran-fucking-tee

45:33.677 --> 45:35.304
you have at that man

45:35.346 --> 45:37.780
and you won't come out
of that joint alive.

45:37.815 --> 45:40.045
No!
The sun ain't rose

45:40.084 --> 45:42.644
on the day I pay heed
to what you say!

45:48.826 --> 45:50.259
Oh.

45:50.294 --> 45:52.489
Oh, what is this?

45:55.099 --> 45:57.090
Oh, oh.

46:02.573 --> 46:05.201
He scared me,
Charlie.

46:07.144 --> 46:08.839
I ain't been scared
like that

46:08.879 --> 46:11.347
since I was
a little girI.

46:11.382 --> 46:13.111
Oh.

46:13.150 --> 46:15.141
Oh, Jesus.

46:27.565 --> 46:29.556
Jane, where you going?

46:35.172 --> 46:37.470
All right.

46:37.508 --> 46:39.999
Now, down there

46:40.044 --> 46:42.638
is Doc Cochran's office.

46:42.680 --> 46:47.014
If that limey cocksucker
comes for that little girI,

46:47.051 --> 46:51.044
I got him triangulated.

46:51.088 --> 46:53.556
If he comes from
that way I got him,

46:53.591 --> 46:56.253
and if he comes
from that way...

46:56.293 --> 46:58.284
I got him.

47:38.802 --> 47:40.895
Here I go.

47:40.938 --> 47:43.634
No words, and no gun
till you're on him.

47:43.674 --> 47:47.075
Here I go.
Revenge for my fucking brother.

48:16.807 --> 48:19.571
The man's gun never left
his holster, Mr. Hickok.

48:19.610 --> 48:21.077
He meant me harm.

48:21.111 --> 48:24.080
You killed my brother,
you son of a bitch!

48:24.114 --> 48:25.672
And now I killed you.

48:25.716 --> 48:27.946
He was going
for his gun.

48:27.985 --> 48:30.579
- I saw it.
- A revenge seeker.

48:30.621 --> 48:32.953
I guess he did
mean you harm.

48:45.703 --> 48:48.297
You're half fucking
blind, ain't you?

48:48.339 --> 48:50.933
Sometimes it's
a fucking blessing.

48:56.947 --> 48:58.972
What the fuck
you looking at?

49:02.720 --> 49:05.314
Like he's
a fucking Adonis.

49:35.719 --> 49:38.279
You go on away from here
for a little while, Doc.

49:40.291 --> 49:42.691
- I won't.
- Go on.

49:42.726 --> 49:44.694
You go see
about the whores.

49:44.728 --> 49:47.322
No.

49:47.364 --> 49:49.992
You know I'll come
through you if I have to.

49:50.034 --> 49:53.731
Let me remind you
of something, Dan.

49:53.771 --> 49:55.932
If you kill me...

49:58.375 --> 50:01.867
then you are up to your
elbows in snatches,

50:01.912 --> 50:05.211
just like you were before
I came to this damn camp.

50:05.249 --> 50:07.376
Taking care of 'em.

50:07.418 --> 50:10.182
Nursing 'em,
day in, day out.

50:10.220 --> 50:13.519
Taking heat from Al
every time one of 'em's poorly.

50:13.557 --> 50:16.219
Up to your elbows.

50:16.260 --> 50:18.160
Between that
and a slit throat

50:18.195 --> 50:20.891
that Al will give me
if I leave that child alive,

50:20.931 --> 50:23.263
I think you know which one
I'm gonna choose.

50:25.202 --> 50:28.399
You just go ahead and do what
you're gonna do 'cause I'm not moving.

50:32.309 --> 50:34.300
Jesus Christ.

50:37.548 --> 50:39.516
You're pitting me
against Al.

50:39.550 --> 50:42.110
So the fuck be it.

50:45.789 --> 50:48.883
Well, I ain't
going it alone.

50:48.926 --> 50:51.690
You're coming with me
to make the case.

51:00.404 --> 51:02.634
Jesus Christ.

51:02.673 --> 51:04.971
Jesus Christ. Have we been asleep
at the switch?

51:05.008 --> 51:08.205
- What's wrong?
- Why's he got his arm on the doc?

51:08.245 --> 51:11.339
You with that ugly fucker
of your own free will?

51:11.382 --> 51:13.145
Yes. Yes, I am.

51:16.420 --> 51:19.355
I'd rather be lucky
than smart.

51:22.559 --> 51:24.720
Word for word
what the hardware guy said.

51:24.762 --> 51:27.356
- The hardware guy?
- The hardware guy.

51:27.398 --> 51:30.458
Didn't you just tell me the hardware guy
was standing next to Hickok?

51:30.501 --> 51:32.128
The hardware guy said
something like,

51:32.169 --> 51:34.000
"Hickok's right.
He was going for his gun.

51:34.037 --> 51:36.130
- I saw him going for it. "
- Something like.

51:36.173 --> 51:38.266
My tooth was paining me
something awfuI,

51:38.308 --> 51:40.469
but I am certain that
was the gist of it.

51:40.511 --> 51:42.945
Get some dope
from Johnny.

51:42.980 --> 51:45.380
Thanks an awfuI lot,
Mr. Swearengen.

51:45.416 --> 51:47.350
My tooth's about
brought me to my knees.

51:50.187 --> 51:51.814
Tell me one thing.

51:51.855 --> 51:55.382
When that idiot made
his move, did he tip it?

51:55.426 --> 51:57.690
Tom didn't
say boo, Al.

51:57.728 --> 52:00.026
Hickok must've
just smelled him.

52:00.063 --> 52:03.794
Al, you're not gonna
believe what happened.

52:03.834 --> 52:05.961
What?

52:07.104 --> 52:09.800
Lunatic that
runs with Hickok

52:09.840 --> 52:12.741
just absconded
with that child.

52:12.776 --> 52:14.937
Must be under
his protection.

52:23.220 --> 52:24.881
Come here.

52:35.065 --> 52:38.330
You're sure that girI doesn't
know what you look like?

52:38.368 --> 52:43.169
Al, I'm confident that girI
don't know what I look like.

52:43.207 --> 52:45.505
But no, I can't guarantee
that to a more certainty.

52:45.542 --> 52:49.137
I know you got your whole operation
here you gotta consider.

52:49.179 --> 52:51.374
And you don't need
to be worried

52:51.415 --> 52:53.042
or troubled about the-

52:53.083 --> 52:55.017
well, as far as that girI
recognizing me,

52:55.052 --> 52:58.647
no matter if it's the slimmest
of the slim possibilities.

52:58.689 --> 53:01.681
So what you want me to do?

53:01.725 --> 53:04.785
You want me to just stay outta camp
until you deal with all this?

53:04.828 --> 53:06.591
Why don't I do that, Al?

53:06.630 --> 53:09.793
How 'bout you have Johnny
check under the rock

53:09.833 --> 53:11.698
and I'll put messages
under the rock.

53:11.735 --> 53:13.896
And then I'm gonna
check under the rock

53:13.937 --> 53:17.737
every day and see if you
wanna send messages to me.

53:19.576 --> 53:21.601
Err on the side
of caution?

53:21.645 --> 53:23.840
That's, uh-
is that a plan?

53:31.355 --> 53:32.913
All right.

53:35.559 --> 53:39.120
Hey Al, think I got time
to put my brand

53:39.162 --> 53:40.891
on a little snatch
before I go?

53:47.838 --> 53:49.533
No loose ends now.

53:50.874 --> 53:52.933
Get up here!

53:52.976 --> 53:55.877
Bring the sled.

54:08.292 --> 54:10.692
& Row, row,
row your boat &

54:10.727 --> 54:12.490
& Gently down
the stream &

54:12.529 --> 54:14.326
& Merrily, merrily... &

54:14.364 --> 54:15.888
God damnit!

54:15.933 --> 54:18.561
& Row, row,
row your boat &

54:18.602 --> 54:20.467
& Gently down
the stream &

54:20.504 --> 54:22.529
- & Merrily, merrily &
- & Row, row, row your boat &

54:22.573 --> 54:24.507
- & Life is but a dream &
- & Gently down the stream... &
