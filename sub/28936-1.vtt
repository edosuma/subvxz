02:14.109 --> 02:18.109
Below our feet

02:53.882 --> 02:54.883
Yeah, I'm coming...

02:56.384 --> 02:57.385
Who is?

03:01.222 --> 03:02.265
My brother

03:04.225 --> 03:05.560
What are you doing?

03:05.977 --> 03:07.145
How come you're here

03:08.772 --> 03:09.856
Come in.

03:14.486 --> 03:16.254
Sorry I came unannounced.

03:16.321 --> 03:19.523
Nothing runs, I just didn't expect you.

03:21.368 --> 03:22.744
There is chaos here.

03:23.912 --> 03:24.913
Have a seat.

03:28.833 --> 03:29.918
Do you want a beer?

03:30.293 --> 03:33.270
I have it in the fridge.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.470
Unfortunately, they are over.

03:41.346 --> 03:42.347
Do you want pizza?

03:42.639 --> 03:43.682
Are you hungry;

03:44.265 --> 03:45.758
no, i'm okay.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.719
Eat, you've slimmed down.

03:47.811 --> 03:48.853
You too.

03:51.606 --> 03:52.774
No, I am fine...

03:53.191 --> 03:54.943
a lot of work,

03:55.276 --> 03:57.295
made me lose pounds.

03:57.445 --> 04:00.840
Do you remember Bacon? He was eating all the time,

04:00.907 --> 04:03.326
said he was a bear,

04:03.493 --> 04:06.121
and how bears should have a big belly.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.747
Yes, it was very stupid.

04:07.914 --> 04:08.832
Yes.

04:09.416 --> 04:10.667
What does Bacon do?

04:11.543 --> 04:13.044
Passed away.

04:14.671 --> 04:15.630
Truth;

04:17.966 --> 04:18.841
Damn it...

04:20.552 --> 04:21.553
Come on, put this on.

04:23.304 --> 04:24.723
As you want.

04:28.226 --> 04:29.394
What happened to you;

04:31.104 --> 04:32.856
Need a place to stay? - No no.

04:34.537 --> 04:35.334
I don't want to bother you.

04:35.358 --> 04:36.735
Speak English.

04:37.652 --> 04:38.987
You have to practice.

04:39.696 --> 04:42.722
It's the only way to find out.

05:15.561 --> 05:18.761
Mall

05:40.340 --> 05:42.966
Mimo, are you ready?

05:49.599 --> 05:51.226
Do you want two more?

05:51.434 --> 05:52.602
Mimo, go up!

05:52.769 --> 05:54.704
Come on, get up fast.

05:54.771 --> 05:55.563
Quickly!

05:57.941 --> 05:59.533
Do not do that...

06:21.172 --> 06:22.340
Thank you very much.

06:45.613 --> 06:46.865
How much did you make?

07:32.869 --> 07:33.995
Let's see how much you have.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.755
I was told that you could help me.

07:43.922 --> 07:45.340
Are not enough.

07:46.841 --> 07:48.343
Not even half.

07:49.761 --> 07:52.287
Give it from here.

07:53.390 --> 07:54.849
Everything will be fine.

07:56.351 --> 07:57.435
Yes, everything will go well.

07:58.895 --> 08:03.024
You know, these things take time.

08:05.694 --> 08:08.321
I don't know, Naya I don't really know.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.992
You trust me, okay?

08:15.412 --> 08:18.722
Listen to your husband.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.961
And to have the suitcases always ready.

08:26.256 --> 08:27.674
I want to ask you something.

08:30.927 --> 08:33.479
Do you know what Mimo has?

08:35.056 --> 08:36.640
I don't know, but she's here.

08:41.312 --> 08:44.205
Is she awake?

08:46.359 --> 08:48.385
Wake him up.

08:48.403 --> 08:50.938
He has to talk to his father.

08:52.282 --> 08:56.051
Okay, put the phone close to his ear.

08:59.622 --> 09:00.623
Small,

09:01.332 --> 09:03.717
I know you're sleeping, but...

09:05.128 --> 09:07.839
White horse

09:09.299 --> 09:11.593
get me on your back

09:12.427 --> 09:14.888
and go with me to the parties

09:15.597 --> 09:17.932
where I grew up...

09:19.059 --> 09:19.976
You are welcome;

09:21.436 --> 09:22.437
New?

09:23.480 --> 09:24.481
Do you hear me?

09:33.990 --> 09:34.949
Thank you.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.672
Perfect!

10:18.451 --> 10:19.411
Get it.

10:31.589 --> 10:32.716
Look there, Tony.

10:33.550 --> 10:37.236
They told him to keep us out of the trucks.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.388
And we have to do it

10:39.014 --> 10:41.432
if we want to survive.

10:41.516 --> 10:43.268
What are you laughing; It's not funny.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.902
Look there, come on, let's go.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.450
Don't come near. - Do not worry.

10:58.616 --> 11:00.744
Come on now, buddy. - I'm not your friend.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.804
Do you look like I'm hungry?

11:02.871 --> 11:05.665
No, but you look like a giant carrot.

11:07.208 --> 11:07.959
No.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.754
I can't accept it... - You're so kind!

11:11.796 --> 11:12.797
Come on and fuck!

11:16.593 --> 11:18.136
Calm down.

11:19.846 --> 11:23.867
Do you build a house? - Hostel.

11:23.933 --> 11:26.061
Do you need workers? - Look at your job.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.396
Will you make it yourself? - A contractor.

11:28.563 --> 11:30.190
You did well.

11:30.648 --> 11:31.733
How much will it cost you?

11:32.359 --> 11:33.360
Ten thousand;

11:35.403 --> 11:36.321
Above;

11:36.863 --> 11:38.114
We can do it cheaper.

11:38.948 --> 11:42.260
I know contractors will charge you a lot.

11:42.327 --> 11:44.128
They keep asking for more and more money.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.247
But we work hard.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.083
We manufacture and clean.

11:48.249 --> 11:51.327
We fix everything and take your dog for a walk.

11:51.461 --> 11:52.462
What are you saying, my lady?

11:53.213 --> 11:54.255
You three?

11:56.132 --> 11:58.259
Yes, but you will need another one.

11:58.426 --> 12:00.095
My brother, Mimo.

12:05.892 --> 12:06.851
Truth...

12:08.269 --> 12:10.205
How much will you charge me?

12:10.271 --> 12:11.231
You...

12:12.357 --> 12:14.392
Charging on time...

12:14.484 --> 12:17.195
No, we'll give you a quote,

12:17.362 --> 12:18.363
a good price.

12:18.804 --> 12:19.804
Tell me,

12:19.853 --> 12:22.320
How much will you tell her? - It's our opportunity to negotiate,

12:22.374 --> 12:24.874
He seems to know nothing.

12:26.746 --> 12:27.956
We can do the job for $ 800.

12:28.849 --> 12:29.749
Not many?

12:32.002 --> 12:32.836
What would you say about $ 500, everyone?

12:37.298 --> 12:39.926
So okay, 500.

12:43.828 --> 12:44.828
Nice tits!

12:45.067 --> 12:46.067
Shut up!

14:01.091 --> 14:02.050
From here.

14:03.885 --> 14:07.013
Let's start with the insulation...

14:40.046 --> 14:41.131
Well, isn't it?

14:43.758 --> 14:44.801
Beautiful place...

14:46.011 --> 14:47.178
Friendly people...

14:48.596 --> 14:50.098
Are you happy;

14:52.017 --> 14:53.268
And why not, Mimo?

14:54.102 --> 14:56.095
At work, I will collect money

14:56.187 --> 14:57.856
and I'll bring Naya and the baby

14:58.732 --> 15:01.192
in a similar house. - Of course...

15:02.444 --> 15:03.570
You have big dreams.

15:21.379 --> 15:22.714
Very good work.

15:23.590 --> 15:24.799
You have to thirst.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.093
Thank you.

15:27.385 --> 15:28.237
You are welcome.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.262
Do you speak spanish;

15:30.513 --> 15:31.848
Get one. - No.

15:32.182 --> 15:33.391
Come on.

15:45.445 --> 15:49.699
Do you want something; - I wonder if you would like

15:49.866 --> 15:51.451
to offer you another service. - Service?

15:51.618 --> 15:52.577
Yes.

15:54.996 --> 15:58.625
I can do all the housework.

16:00.502 --> 16:01.961
Well, I'll think about it.

16:13.056 --> 16:14.974
Thank God you came.

16:18.436 --> 16:19.688
Who is this guy?

16:22.107 --> 16:23.525
She is her husband, the poor one.

16:24.150 --> 16:25.110
What;

16:25.652 --> 16:27.821
Did you think it fell on you?

16:28.488 --> 16:30.365
Maybe you can help them...

16:30.532 --> 16:32.325
Make some bra.

16:35.537 --> 16:36.663
You laugh;

16:45.588 --> 16:46.589
I am joking!

17:02.772 --> 17:03.732
What;

17:04.023 --> 17:06.349
I thought we would relax on the weekend.

17:06.443 --> 17:07.609
Chill out.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.319
What will happen to them? - What do you mean;

17:11.239 --> 17:13.950
Suppose we are alone. What do you want to do;

17:15.035 --> 17:18.704
We have to drive them out.

17:20.290 --> 17:21.207
Okay.

17:21.499 --> 17:24.752
But they will take it for granted. - I think they will live.

18:02.332 --> 18:03.917
Sorry, hates strangers.

18:04.084 --> 18:05.210
Sam, stop immediately.

18:06.961 --> 18:08.004
Do you want something;

18:09.297 --> 18:10.548
Your bathroom?

18:12.967 --> 18:14.010
You can't get in.

18:15.095 --> 18:16.096
Did you see who you are?

18:17.514 --> 18:18.598
You're dirty.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.029
Bring me a sandpaper.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.520
You don't see that in Mexico.

19:06.396 --> 19:07.814
You are crazy.

19:09.024 --> 19:10.108
I do not understand.

19:11.109 --> 19:14.803
Who sends his wife to find foreign workers?

19:15.530 --> 19:18.742
We can be dangerous or nothing psychic.

19:19.617 --> 19:21.453
And who told you he would pay us?

19:32.797 --> 19:33.798
What happened;

19:34.257 --> 19:35.717
Where is the sandpaper? - What;

19:43.558 --> 19:44.434
No.

19:44.976 --> 19:46.102
I do not see anything.

19:51.024 --> 19:52.650
No one works like that.

19:56.571 --> 19:57.572
Tone?

19:58.990 --> 20:01.326
Have you seen my phone anywhere? - How is it;

20:02.243 --> 20:06.081
It is small, red and looks like a telephone.

20:07.791 --> 20:08.875
Where is.

20:09.626 --> 20:11.961
Who listens to her if I don't call her.

20:12.754 --> 20:13.755
Which;

20:14.673 --> 20:15.548
My wife.

20:32.691 --> 20:33.983
They put spotlights on.

21:05.765 --> 21:06.683
Well;

21:08.977 --> 21:09.936
You do...

21:11.104 --> 21:12.272
I do not see anything.

21:27.120 --> 21:30.139
She's gone, enough,

21:30.331 --> 21:31.832
arrives!

21:32.667 --> 21:36.586
They want to work day and night.

21:36.880 --> 21:39.498
They think we will give up.

21:39.507 --> 21:41.600
You know what; Let...

21:42.135 --> 21:43.678
let's rest.

21:43.762 --> 21:44.596
And let us see.

21:46.514 --> 21:47.349
Let us see.

22:31.101 --> 22:31.893
Why aren't you working?

22:32.268 --> 22:34.187
Do you know what time it is? - What time is it;

22:34.354 --> 22:35.814
You can leave. - Pay us first.

22:35.980 --> 22:37.273
Why pay you?

22:37.857 --> 22:41.319
You haven't finished the job. - We worked all night, senator...

22:41.486 --> 22:42.420
Senior?

22:42.487 --> 22:44.739
Do you look like a co-immigrant?

22:47.325 --> 22:48.201
Do you know what?

22:48.368 --> 22:49.494
You will get up and leave.

22:49.661 --> 22:51.204
I'll find other workers,

22:51.371 --> 22:53.665
that will not be unpleasant. - No no.

22:54.791 --> 22:55.625
We will stay.

22:56.292 --> 22:57.085
We will stay.

22:57.252 --> 23:00.730
But I don't want you to think I'm wrong.

23:00.797 --> 23:01.673
Nerd.

23:02.132 --> 23:03.049
Please, Madam.

23:03.521 --> 23:05.121
We are not slaves. - Stop it!

23:06.970 --> 23:07.887
Please, Madam.

23:10.515 --> 23:11.307
Okay.

23:12.308 --> 23:16.137
I'll go back to my bed while you gentlemen,

23:16.187 --> 23:17.313
you will continue your work.

23:20.025 --> 23:21.192
What was that;

23:22.235 --> 23:23.945
The woman is crazy.

26:52.862 --> 26:53.655
Despite.

26:54.531 --> 26:55.573
What are you doing;

26:56.074 --> 26:57.534
We didn't finish this track.

27:00.745 --> 27:01.621
Are you deaf?

27:03.498 --> 27:04.499
Got tired,

27:05.834 --> 27:08.352
I'm tired of listening to you.

27:08.378 --> 27:09.879
No, you are lazy.

27:10.046 --> 27:11.715
You've learned it easily.

27:12.132 --> 27:15.051
Did you forget why you came here? - How can I forget it?

27:16.469 --> 27:20.131
You're constantly reminding me of that. - No one cares about you,

27:20.223 --> 27:20.974
except me.

27:27.689 --> 27:28.690
Seriously;

27:31.401 --> 27:33.653
You've worked hard the last couple of days.

27:36.823 --> 27:38.533
Sorry for the last eight years....

27:42.203 --> 27:43.538
I have a family, you idiot.

27:44.414 --> 27:45.540
And I have a son.

27:46.041 --> 27:50.119
When did you last see him? I know him better than you.

27:50.128 --> 27:52.439
You want to collect money to bring him here.

27:52.505 --> 27:56.015
And he will become a slave like his father.

28:18.531 --> 28:20.325
Not so, you will hit,

28:21.117 --> 28:22.410
you will cut no hand.

28:25.246 --> 28:26.664
I told you, stupid.

28:28.124 --> 28:29.084
To see.

28:29.250 --> 28:30.377
I told you.

28:33.463 --> 28:34.547
Senior.

28:36.424 --> 28:38.218
Seniora, we had an accident.

28:44.182 --> 28:45.100
Wait.

28:49.396 --> 28:50.230
To see it.

29:02.826 --> 29:03.993
Are you ready.

29:04.869 --> 29:05.954
It's a scar.

29:06.121 --> 29:07.372
He has to go to the hospital.

29:08.623 --> 29:10.625
Okay, I'll call an ambulance.

29:17.257 --> 29:18.942
Of course, they will ask for information about you,

29:19.009 --> 29:20.093
for the police record.

29:20.260 --> 29:21.469
Do you hear me? - Police?

29:21.636 --> 29:23.654
Yes, wait.

29:25.223 --> 29:26.641
Hello. - Wait.

29:27.976 --> 29:29.227
We do not have a residence permit.

29:34.774 --> 29:35.984
And what do you want me to do?

29:36.443 --> 29:38.903
You can take him to a clinic.

29:39.070 --> 29:41.531
Don't you think you have many requirements?

29:42.407 --> 29:44.075
When will you finish your job? - What;

29:44.451 --> 29:49.579
I will have many problems with the police for recruiting illegal immigrants.

29:49.581 --> 29:51.166
I have to tell them a story.

29:51.499 --> 29:54.769
For example, that you are thieves who came to my house to rob me...

29:54.836 --> 29:56.171
What; - Why are you saying this?

29:56.338 --> 29:57.505
We're done.

29:59.841 --> 30:02.010
Open the door! - October,

30:02.177 --> 30:04.220
relax, he will call the police. - Let's call her.

30:04.554 --> 30:07.182
Mimo, don't talk. - He won't call the police.

30:07.349 --> 30:08.224
And why risk it?

30:08.391 --> 30:10.518
Let's finish the job, and let's go.

30:10.685 --> 30:14.171
I knew from the beginning that this crazy woman would give us nothing.

30:14.189 --> 30:18.591
How many immigrants are like us? No one has a good reputation.

30:22.697 --> 30:24.032
Where are you going;

30:37.337 --> 30:40.873
Where did your brother go? - I have no idea.

30:40.965 --> 30:41.925
Despite?

30:43.885 --> 30:44.886
Despite?

30:50.475 --> 30:51.685
Where did it go;

31:00.402 --> 31:01.486
What happened to you; - The fence...

31:02.070 --> 31:05.154
... is a power carrier.

31:07.575 --> 31:09.411
The fence surrounds the whole plot.

31:18.545 --> 31:20.630
And what are we doing now;

31:23.008 --> 31:24.843
We'll leave where we came in,

31:25.760 --> 31:26.720
from the main gate.

31:27.178 --> 31:28.346
And how do we do that?

31:30.390 --> 31:32.308
There is a remote control in the car.

31:33.101 --> 31:34.811
We just have to steal it.

31:38.356 --> 31:39.441
That is easy.

31:40.025 --> 31:42.684
No, the alarm will sound.

31:42.736 --> 31:44.446
We need to get the keys first.

31:46.364 --> 31:48.450
Mimo, where are you going? Don't be an idiot...

31:48.616 --> 31:50.160
Listen to your brother.

31:51.786 --> 31:52.787
Be careful!

31:54.456 --> 31:58.583
Then you fight. Calm down a bit!

32:41.002 --> 32:42.712
I'm not afraid, assholes.

33:07.779 --> 33:08.822
What is this;

33:38.101 --> 33:39.436
Stay on the ground!

33:49.529 --> 33:51.281
Fuck!

33:56.077 --> 33:58.788
I'll fuck your mom, whore!

34:14.512 --> 34:16.681
That was self-defense.

34:17.474 --> 34:18.808
He came to my house.

34:36.201 --> 34:37.994
Well dude,

34:38.786 --> 34:43.232
Finish your work, and you won't have to worry, okay?

34:43.333 --> 34:44.292
Then you can leave.

34:44.458 --> 34:45.543
Now get up.

34:47.962 --> 34:48.713
Come on.

34:55.512 --> 34:56.596
Do you speak English;

34:58.348 --> 35:00.058
Do you speak English?

35:00.767 --> 35:01.726
Tony!

35:08.191 --> 35:12.385
Come on, do your job. and everything will be fine.

35:14.656 --> 35:15.740
Let's go.

35:16.991 --> 35:18.493
If something happens to you...

35:24.332 --> 35:26.225
Load all the sharp tools here.

35:32.966 --> 35:35.742
Do a good job.

36:02.037 --> 36:03.204
Jose Alfredo?

36:06.541 --> 36:08.543
Oh my God!

36:08.710 --> 36:10.545
These guys have no sense of humor.

36:14.132 --> 36:16.760
Well, take the stroller and go.

36:17.552 --> 36:18.303
Okay;

36:35.945 --> 36:37.280
Why are you looking at me?

36:39.574 --> 36:42.035
Look at her and... - No.

36:42.343 --> 36:43.428
Relax, buddy.

36:45.445 --> 36:46.845
If we obey it, it won't matter.

36:48.041 --> 36:51.642
Do you want to end up like Hector?

36:51.670 --> 36:52.629
No.

36:53.588 --> 36:54.255
You.

36:57.509 --> 36:58.677
Come here right.

36:59.094 --> 37:00.011
Come.

37:15.902 --> 37:17.362
I don't want any more bourbon - bourbon.

37:18.697 --> 37:19.698
Did you understand?

37:40.927 --> 37:41.636
Here you go;

37:42.971 --> 37:44.597
Can you open the door, please?

37:44.764 --> 37:45.807
Yes of course.

37:46.850 --> 37:47.767
Yes.

37:50.727 --> 37:51.247
Thank you.

37:51.271 --> 37:51.980
Okay.

37:53.481 --> 37:57.059
You think we are bad people, right?

37:57.569 --> 37:59.445
That's what you think.

38:00.405 --> 38:02.131
Do you have a wife?

38:06.369 --> 38:08.495
Then you understand me.

38:23.470 --> 38:24.387
How is it going;

38:26.681 --> 38:27.891
I have to clean the floor.

38:28.058 --> 38:30.060
Give it up, and come with me.

38:31.227 --> 38:33.730
I have to clean the floor.

38:47.952 --> 38:50.163
Fifteen million people.

38:51.039 --> 38:53.375
Fifteen million people.

38:56.044 --> 38:57.379
No residence permit.

39:00.924 --> 39:02.258
Who are these people?

39:04.719 --> 39:06.054
Can we trust them?

39:07.013 --> 39:08.264
Are they criminals?

39:17.732 --> 39:20.618
You don't understand what I'm saying, right?

39:27.617 --> 39:29.035
Here is my home,

39:29.786 --> 39:31.246
and it will become your grave.

39:31.788 --> 39:33.248
I'll bury you here!

39:34.207 --> 39:35.250
Did you understand;

39:41.006 --> 39:41.923
Well...

39:43.383 --> 39:44.426
I should probably give you lessons.

39:45.051 --> 39:46.261
Will have a lot of fun.

39:47.262 --> 39:50.015
An intensive English lesson.

39:51.141 --> 39:52.350
Where do we start from?

39:52.517 --> 39:54.019
What would you say about...

39:55.186 --> 39:56.604
I am happy.

40:08.033 --> 40:09.784
I am...

40:11.119 --> 40:12.203
cheerful.

40:13.121 --> 40:15.580
I am...

40:15.665 --> 40:16.791
cheerful.

40:19.002 --> 40:20.211
Very Good.

40:24.632 --> 40:28.803
I'm sad.

40:30.472 --> 40:32.990
I am...

40:33.141 --> 40:34.601
sad.

40:35.101 --> 40:36.978
Very good!

40:38.271 --> 40:39.856
Let's go to the next one.

40:44.944 --> 40:47.572
I'm afraid, madam.

40:56.873 --> 40:58.625
You failed in English.

42:11.656 --> 42:12.907
Yes Yes.

42:15.577 --> 42:19.205
What offers can we expect? - The offers are very good.

42:19.414 --> 42:22.625
We can reject any offer that does not suit us.

42:24.294 --> 42:25.920
Give us a number.

42:27.547 --> 42:29.406
It's hard to say number.

42:29.924 --> 42:32.135
Almost.

42:32.927 --> 42:34.429
About...

42:36.431 --> 42:37.557
About five hundred.

42:38.058 --> 42:39.434
Seriously; - I'm not sure.

42:39.642 --> 42:40.602
Too late.

42:41.478 --> 42:45.006
That house at the foot of the mountain, is it for sale?

42:45.440 --> 42:46.358
Yes, Madam.

42:46.524 --> 42:48.651
I always liked that house, it has a huge garden.

42:49.444 --> 42:50.487
It interests you;

42:51.821 --> 42:52.906
Everything will be done.

42:53.365 --> 42:56.326
To be honest, you better forget this house.

42:56.743 --> 42:57.935
It has termites...

42:57.994 --> 42:59.079
It has a lot of damage.

43:00.163 --> 43:01.247
This is bad news.

43:01.664 --> 43:04.457
translation mainN

43:08.004 --> 43:09.005
Well...

43:09.756 --> 43:11.424
When are our visitors coming?

43:12.509 --> 43:13.968
I think there is a couple who are interested.

43:14.135 --> 43:16.388
Truth; - What do you say about tomorrow afternoon?

43:17.514 --> 43:18.682
Will you be ready?

43:19.140 --> 43:20.850
Of course, we will be ready.

43:21.101 --> 43:22.435
You can send them.

43:24.979 --> 43:27.547
They won't like it at all.

43:31.486 --> 43:33.004
What is the order?

43:33.196 --> 43:35.740
They have to dig.

43:37.409 --> 43:40.510
They will make it;

44:03.018 --> 44:04.019
Take off your clothes!

44:09.315 --> 44:10.734
Get out...

44:11.151 --> 44:12.193
... your clothes!

44:22.620 --> 44:23.663
Take it out!

44:24.873 --> 44:25.832
You too.

44:28.668 --> 44:29.919
Okay.

44:35.342 --> 44:36.426
Come.

44:38.261 --> 44:40.055
Don't look so sad.

45:03.161 --> 45:04.162
Despite...

45:06.039 --> 45:07.248
Keep going.

45:14.339 --> 45:15.965
I like this piece.

45:54.796 --> 45:57.507
Cemetery.

46:01.052 --> 46:02.262
Cemetery.

46:02.846 --> 46:03.847
Please.

46:04.931 --> 46:06.766
Cemetery. - Can I dig his own?

46:07.517 --> 46:09.452
What; - He can't work anymore.

46:09.519 --> 46:10.770
Can't work?

46:13.064 --> 46:14.691
Bring me the shovel.

46:17.047 --> 46:18.447
Give him the shovel, Antonio.

46:25.035 --> 46:25.910
Okay.

46:31.791 --> 46:33.209
Enough.

46:34.711 --> 46:35.628
Turn around.

47:53.415 --> 47:54.916
I told him to give it to him.

47:56.126 --> 47:57.627
Not your fault.

48:29.743 --> 48:31.119
I need a shovel.

48:31.953 --> 48:32.996
It is very big.

48:34.789 --> 48:35.957
Do you understand?

48:37.459 --> 48:39.377
Look at these roots.

48:40.962 --> 48:42.213
They are very large.

48:43.882 --> 48:46.384
And this hole is very small.

48:46.718 --> 48:51.121
And you're a great whore!

48:54.517 --> 48:55.143
Despite!

49:01.107 --> 49:01.983
No!

49:02.984 --> 49:04.527
I want everything to be beautiful.

49:23.171 --> 49:24.297
What are you going to do;

49:36.059 --> 49:37.352
I've grown up now.

49:40.605 --> 49:44.467
Do you know what I used to say when they were bothering me?

49:45.777 --> 49:47.428
My big brother will come,

49:48.113 --> 49:51.031
and it will stab you in the wood.

49:53.034 --> 49:54.577
But I was stupid.

49:57.330 --> 49:58.456
Because you left.

50:00.458 --> 50:03.493
So, I learned to fight on my own.

50:12.053 --> 50:15.404
And I'm still alive.

50:16.433 --> 50:17.726
Come on, run.

50:18.226 --> 50:19.436
Real estate!

50:22.447 --> 50:23.740
Alejandro!

50:26.026 --> 50:26.818
Where is the other?

50:28.528 --> 50:31.781
Slowly, they will go. - They cut off the electricity.

50:32.365 --> 50:33.450
Go.

50:42.667 --> 50:45.712
Mimo, I don't see anything. - Follow me.

53:37.759 --> 53:38.510
No!

53:53.775 --> 53:55.068
No!

54:46.202 --> 54:47.245
Ben.

54:49.080 --> 54:51.082
The buyers came.

55:16.858 --> 55:17.650
Liz?

55:18.985 --> 55:19.736
I'm Sandra.

55:19.903 --> 55:21.696
And this is my husband, Homer. - Hello.

55:23.990 --> 55:24.949
Come in.

57:01.463 --> 57:02.255
Alejandro.

57:31.242 --> 57:33.453
Go away. - Do not move!

57:34.037 --> 57:34.871
No!

57:36.039 --> 57:37.665
Let me.

57:44.881 --> 57:45.590
Please.

57:48.843 --> 57:49.886
Do not move.

57:52.931 --> 57:54.057
Brother.

58:15.203 --> 58:17.371
What is your favorite poison?

58:17.414 --> 58:18.873
Here you go;

58:18.873 --> 58:19.916
What will you drink;

58:21.751 --> 58:23.461
Whiskey. - Okay.

58:28.508 --> 58:30.385
I like that it's high ceiling.

58:47.277 --> 58:48.028
Do you like;

58:48.820 --> 58:51.589
Very beautiful! - We just renovated it.

58:51.656 --> 58:52.657
Thanks!

58:57.656 --> 58:59.657
The place is stinking!

59:22.437 --> 59:24.805
Who did the job?

59:24.898 --> 59:29.169
Among us, illegal workers

59:29.235 --> 59:30.028
Seriously;

59:30.195 --> 59:32.697
Most of them are unemployed.

59:35.075 --> 59:36.076
This is terrible.

59:37.118 --> 59:40.536
And they come all the time.

01:00:08.358 --> 01:00:09.776
The floor...

01:00:10.902 --> 01:00:12.112
It's not over yet.

01:00:25.875 --> 01:00:28.119
What do you think, do you want to make a bid?

01:00:28.211 --> 01:00:29.879
Well, I really liked it.

01:00:30.463 --> 01:00:33.133
Truth; - The house is perfect for both of you.

01:00:33.591 --> 01:00:35.760
Is that all yours?

01:00:36.344 --> 01:00:38.513
Yes, we renew them.

01:01:25.477 --> 01:01:27.145
Why are you looking at me like that;

01:01:33.651 --> 01:01:35.487
Did you see my son recently?

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:41.701
My son,

01:01:43.703 --> 01:01:44.704
how is it;

01:01:49.209 --> 01:01:50.335
Do I look at all?

01:02:57.652 --> 01:02:58.653
Alejandro.

01:03:00.196 --> 01:03:01.364
Alejandro.

01:03:14.794 --> 01:03:16.296
It wasn't that bad.

01:03:26.473 --> 01:03:27.474
Where are you;

01:03:32.437 --> 01:03:33.438
Damn it.

01:04:36.126 --> 01:04:37.502
How how.

01:04:52.851 --> 01:04:53.893
Shit!

01:04:56.646 --> 01:04:58.189
Okay, we have to walk.

01:04:58.815 --> 01:05:00.817
Let's go.

01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:04.045
Wait, I'm fine. I can walk.

01:05:04.112 --> 01:05:07.282
Two three. - I can walk.

01:05:07.449 --> 01:05:08.950
I can walk, I can...

01:05:13.705 --> 01:05:14.789
I can not.

01:05:16.124 --> 01:05:17.500
You can't walk.

01:05:25.925 --> 01:05:27.093
I have to leave you here.

01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:32.891
Stay here and make no noise.

01:05:33.058 --> 01:05:35.018
Okay; I will be back.

01:05:35.810 --> 01:05:36.728
No, Mimo.

01:05:38.813 --> 01:05:39.981
Don't go back.

01:05:41.441 --> 01:05:42.317
Wait here.

01:05:42.484 --> 01:05:43.568
No, Mimo.

01:05:47.530 --> 01:05:48.573
Why;

01:05:50.033 --> 01:05:53.076
Listen to your little brother once.

01:07:37.265 --> 01:07:38.058
Sir.

01:07:46.316 --> 01:07:47.317
Despite.

01:08:10.048 --> 01:08:14.166
Is that what you dreamed of?

01:08:14.969 --> 01:08:18.962
It is very sad that everything is over.

01:08:23.019 --> 01:08:25.814
Do you want to say something?

01:08:25.979 --> 01:08:26.856
My love.

01:08:37.367 --> 01:08:38.368
Calm down.

01:08:59.096 --> 01:09:00.098
Raise your head.

01:09:00.473 --> 01:09:02.991
It's not your lucky day.

01:09:03.184 --> 01:09:04.185
Yes.

01:09:04.810 --> 01:09:05.854
Arrives.

01:09:07.604 --> 01:09:08.606
Please!

01:09:44.434 --> 01:09:46.560
Do you think they will make an offer for the home?

01:09:46.728 --> 01:09:49.013
If they don't, someone else will.

01:09:49.022 --> 01:09:52.700
You did a really great job at this house.

01:09:54.903 --> 01:09:57.345
I just helped.

01:09:57.864 --> 01:10:01.534
I'll get Richard tomorrow to see if he has other buyers.

01:10:21.888 --> 01:10:23.306
Oh my God!

01:10:54.129 --> 01:10:55.771
Do you want to drink?

01:10:55.797 --> 01:10:56.589
It's Jeans.

01:11:08.727 --> 01:11:09.644
Thank you.

01:11:27.412 --> 01:11:28.163
Damn it!

01:11:35.712 --> 01:11:36.838
Antonio.

01:11:38.048 --> 01:11:39.466
Do you want another drink?

01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:11.915
Antonio.

01:12:36.773 --> 01:12:38.191
Antonio.

01:14:06.696 --> 01:14:07.614
Ben!

01:14:08.114 --> 01:14:10.033
Ben!

01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:11.993
Ben!

01:14:12.535 --> 01:14:13.453
Ben!

01:14:15.038 --> 01:14:16.039
Ben!

01:15:45.086 --> 01:15:49.847
You've done a lot of work for your friends.

01:15:50.467 --> 01:15:52.135
It will take a great deal of effort to fix all of this.

01:16:52.654 --> 01:16:54.489
How many did you kill?

01:17:11.589 --> 01:17:13.049
Wake up, man.

01:17:22.642 --> 01:17:23.601
You...

01:17:24.769 --> 01:17:25.812
Where's Ben?

01:17:27.230 --> 01:17:28.898
The hell he got it.

01:17:31.776 --> 01:17:34.286
So was that your plan?

01:17:34.362 --> 01:17:37.506
To make your homes,

01:17:37.574 --> 01:17:39.125
and then bury us...

01:17:40.827 --> 01:17:42.286
... to them?

01:17:45.623 --> 01:17:47.042
Very good design.

01:17:48.585 --> 01:17:52.437
You think we're cockroaches, right?

01:17:52.589 --> 01:17:53.965
Maybe we are.

01:17:57.761 --> 01:18:00.246
You can cheat us,

01:18:00.472 --> 01:18:02.665
but we do not die.

01:18:02.932 --> 01:18:05.000
We will spread.

01:18:05.685 --> 01:18:10.190
You can't stop what's coming, my lady.

01:18:13.443 --> 01:18:14.252
Can you hear me;

01:18:14.319 --> 01:18:15.362
Oh my god!

01:18:15.528 --> 01:18:16.279
Aid!

01:18:16.821 --> 01:18:20.791
Please! - Look at me, whore!

01:18:21.201 --> 01:18:23.870
Get on your knees and ask for mercy!

01:18:24.037 --> 01:18:25.121
Please!

01:18:25.288 --> 01:18:29.884
I just wanted a safe place to live. I want you to understand.

01:18:30.043 --> 01:18:31.294
Please.

01:18:33.129 --> 01:18:34.863
Please.

01:19:16.464 --> 01:19:18.591
My God, please!

01:20:02.552 --> 01:20:03.720
Do you believe all this?

01:20:05.096 --> 01:20:08.507
They have to think very well who they are going to hire.

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:11.334
Did you catch the guy?

01:20:11.478 --> 01:20:14.630
Neither identity nor address.

01:20:15.106 --> 01:20:16.232
It disappeared.

01:20:46.721 --> 01:20:47.639
Nerd.

01:20:49.349 --> 01:20:53.009
Children are very expensive.

01:21:09.869 --> 01:21:10.829
Nice.

01:21:11.705 --> 01:21:13.081
It will be here in a month.

01:21:13.832 --> 01:21:16.509
Promise me you won't put them in a coffin.

01:21:22.424 --> 01:21:23.216
I promise.

01:21:34.561 --> 01:21:37.872
Here is the solution to all our problems,

01:21:38.023 --> 01:21:41.251
I prefer to call it: "Compulsory labor"

01:21:41.317 --> 01:21:45.363
The people who come here illegally will belong to the state.

01:21:45.530 --> 01:21:47.198
They become the property of the state,

01:21:47.365 --> 01:21:49.826
and that puts them to work,

01:21:49.993 --> 01:21:52.762
where there are needs.

01:21:52.829 --> 01:21:54.706
Yeah, that sounds like a good idea

01:21:54.873 --> 01:21:56.624
I totally agree.

01:21:56.791 --> 01:21:58.126
But finally you know...

01:21:58.293 --> 01:22:03.422
When you start applying this idea, you will find that the consequences are harsh...

01:22:03.423 --> 01:22:07.334
I don't think... - A minute sir, what do you mean by that?

01:22:07.385 --> 01:22:11.038
People will say that this is a new kind of business.

01:22:11.097 --> 01:22:14.308
So, and what is the problem with slavery?

01:22:18.395 --> 01:22:21.795
Below our feet
