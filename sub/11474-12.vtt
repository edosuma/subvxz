WEBVTT

00:00.245 --> 00:01.564
Previously on "Hunters"...

00:01.565 --> 00:04.100
I saw something being
hauled in on a giant flatbed.

00:04.134 --> 00:05.968
- A missile?
- Victor Karp.

00:06.003 --> 00:07.937
- I'm Regan.
- Well, Agent Regan.

00:07.971 --> 00:09.439
What are you gonna do with my blood?

00:09.473 --> 00:11.774
Don't you worry your
pretty little head about that.

00:11.809 --> 00:13.344
- I need to see you.
- You okay?

00:13.346 --> 00:16.137
I've papers and photos
from those boxes in our house.

00:16.146 --> 00:18.281
I know Abby isn't who
we thought she was.

00:18.315 --> 00:19.449
Emme, I'm still the same person.

00:20.784 --> 00:22.118
You're not a person.

00:22.152 --> 00:23.519
Finnerman tried to bribe
me into containing Emme.

00:23.554 --> 00:24.921
Can I please just call my dad?

00:24.955 --> 00:26.022
Flynn is not your dad.

00:26.056 --> 00:27.223
He's all I've got.

00:27.257 --> 00:28.458
The Purge isn't what you think.

00:28.492 --> 00:30.193
You're launching a nuclear attack on us.

00:30.227 --> 00:32.095
We're not planning an attack.

00:32.128 --> 00:33.796
We're trying to leave Earth.

00:33.831 --> 00:35.569
Are you still getting direct orders

00:35.570 --> 00:36.499
from Assistant Secretary Finnerman?

00:36.533 --> 00:38.134
This is a kill mission.

00:38.168 --> 00:40.770
All Hunters are to be shot on sight.

00:41.805 --> 00:43.005
Regan is inside.

00:43.040 --> 00:44.273
Agent Regan can't be trusted.

00:44.308 --> 00:46.175
She's my agent, not yours.

00:46.210 --> 00:47.910
You are no longer in command here.

00:47.945 --> 00:49.178
Take your hands off me.

00:49.213 --> 00:50.810
I have come to set you free!

00:50.914 --> 00:52.014
Something's happening.

00:52.049 --> 00:54.450
The Hunters have
released some kind of tear gas.

00:56.186 --> 00:57.553
Come on.

00:57.588 --> 00:59.055
Let's get you out of here.

01:04.061 --> 01:05.895
Afraid for his brother.

01:05.929 --> 01:07.897
Afraid for his family.

01:07.931 --> 01:12.268
Afraid for his
belongings and his livelihood...

01:32.823 --> 01:34.123
Jackson.

01:36.226 --> 01:38.361
Took out the whole unit.

01:38.395 --> 01:41.130
My God.

01:41.165 --> 01:42.899
Patrol came across opium smugglers.

01:42.933 --> 01:45.268
Around here?

01:45.302 --> 01:48.771
Terrain is too rugged for a drug route.

01:48.805 --> 01:50.273
40 miles west.

01:50.307 --> 01:52.341
After the fight, the
patrol seized the opium

01:52.376 --> 01:55.478
to bring back to base, but
they were hunted down.

01:56.513 --> 01:58.214
Hunted down?

01:59.449 --> 02:03.419
That doesn't sound like Taliban.

02:03.453 --> 02:05.788
It wasn't Taliban.

02:06.452 --> 02:07.924
The Defense Secretary trusts

02:07.958 --> 02:10.258
will handle this with discretion.

02:12.029 --> 02:15.364
It's a tragic loss for these men.

02:23.073 --> 02:25.775
What you're about to see...

02:25.809 --> 02:27.310
this changes everything, Truss.

02:28.145 --> 02:29.378
In what regard?

02:31.982 --> 02:35.785
For a start, your belief in God.

02:51.401 --> 02:53.169
Truss?

02:53.203 --> 02:54.837
You all right?

02:56.139 --> 02:58.507
I need to make a call, I'll be right in.

02:58.542 --> 03:01.177
You got a lot jealous
looks on the way out.

03:01.211 --> 03:04.747
Yeah, well, Brother
Patterson does tend to drone on.

03:04.781 --> 03:06.782
Oh, please, you're being too kind.

03:06.817 --> 03:09.051
The man is a sleeping pill in a suit.

03:09.086 --> 03:11.787
I have no idea what's going on.

03:11.822 --> 03:13.923
I need to call the Under Secretary

03:13.957 --> 03:15.224
and explain my side of things.

03:15.259 --> 03:18.027
Honey, we've talk about this.

03:18.061 --> 03:20.229
Going over your boss's
head can only make things worse.

03:20.264 --> 03:21.964
I can't sit on my hands.

03:21.999 --> 03:23.866
I need to know my team's safe.

03:23.900 --> 03:26.435
Oh, Truss, you and
Ruth go back 30 years.

03:26.470 --> 03:27.903
You're integral to the unit.

03:27.938 --> 03:30.740
She will put you back in charge.

03:30.774 --> 03:32.441
Hmm?

03:32.476 --> 03:33.809
I hope you're right.

03:35.379 --> 03:38.214
But then you usually are, so.

03:38.248 --> 03:39.949
Let's go back inside.

03:39.983 --> 03:42.018
Sermon's almost over.

03:42.052 --> 03:45.154
You'll be the envy of
the entire congregation.

03:45.188 --> 03:48.524
Hey, I already am.

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

04:27.864 --> 04:29.865
Federal authorities report

04:29.900 --> 04:32.101
that the shooting spree was
conducted by a lone gunman.

04:32.135 --> 04:34.003
Jeff Yang.

04:34.037 --> 04:37.840
Yang, 38, killed 34 people
at a hotel in Rittman, Ohio.

04:37.874 --> 04:38.908
Thank you.

04:38.942 --> 04:39.942
Can I help you?

04:39.976 --> 04:41.477
Howdy, I'm gonna need...

04:50.887 --> 04:53.155
Not all conspicuous.

04:53.190 --> 04:56.179
Best WiFi signal I could
find on this dinosaur

04:56.293 --> 04:57.026
without going inside.

04:57.060 --> 04:59.261
Relax, we drove all
night, no one's gonna find us.

04:59.572 --> 05:01.172
Easy for you to say.

05:01.207 --> 05:03.341
Finnerman didn't try to execute you.

05:05.544 --> 05:07.545
You're hacking ETU?

05:07.580 --> 05:09.447
To see if they
found the launch location.

05:10.683 --> 05:12.550
And warn the Hunters.

05:12.585 --> 05:14.219
You're not serious.

05:14.253 --> 05:16.187
Abby said the Purge isn't an attack.

05:16.222 --> 05:18.123
The Hunters are just
trying to return home.

05:18.157 --> 05:20.458
Abby lies. She lies.

05:20.493 --> 05:21.493
She can't be trusted.

05:21.527 --> 05:23.261
An neither can the ETU.

05:23.295 --> 05:25.063
Jackson's out.

05:25.097 --> 05:27.332
Finnerman's running the show.

05:27.366 --> 05:29.501
She's gonna kill everyone, Flynn.

05:29.535 --> 05:31.703
Including you now
that you're helping me.

05:31.737 --> 05:34.119
And if the Hunters are
planning a nuclear attack,

05:34.293 --> 05:36.902
then thousands of
innocent human lives will be lost.

05:39.745 --> 05:41.479
There's someone who knows.

05:41.514 --> 05:44.182
Victor Karp, the arms dealer.

05:44.216 --> 05:47.884
I need a burner phone and some lotion.

05:49.488 --> 05:51.656
Whatever you can find.

05:52.491 --> 05:53.692
No problem.

05:59.065 --> 06:00.398
Musa's hurt, take him inside.

06:00.433 --> 06:02.500
Hurry!

06:05.004 --> 06:06.237
Careful!

06:08.307 --> 06:09.876
On the table.

06:10.009 --> 06:11.176
We drove straight from the hotel,

06:11.210 --> 06:12.177
got here as fast as we could.

06:13.446 --> 06:14.412
He should be
healing, I don't understand.

06:14.447 --> 06:16.114
The wound is too deep.

06:16.148 --> 06:17.716
His human body needs human
medicine. Hold him down.

06:17.750 --> 06:19.417
Is he going to be okay?

06:22.188 --> 06:23.221
Shh.

06:25.424 --> 06:26.691
He saved us at the hotel.

06:26.726 --> 06:29.127
- What were you doing there?
- Trying to help.

06:29.161 --> 06:30.562
And I did.

06:36.802 --> 06:38.303
They'll pay for this.

06:48.714 --> 06:50.115
Got it.

06:50.149 --> 06:51.449
You got what?

06:51.484 --> 06:53.418
I heard a phone number
Karp dialed a few times.

06:54.620 --> 06:55.653
Hunter hearing.

06:56.589 --> 06:58.289
So where is he?

07:01.160 --> 07:03.261
The number pings to Rochester.

07:03.295 --> 07:05.130
New York?

07:05.164 --> 07:07.232
Minnesota.

07:07.266 --> 07:09.000
There's a defense cluster there.

07:09.034 --> 07:11.536
Makes sense, he's a weapons dealer.

07:11.570 --> 07:14.639
If he isn't there, someone
who knows him is.

07:14.673 --> 07:16.107
We find Karp, we find Musa.

07:18.778 --> 07:22.647
Hey, no running, this is a parking lot.

07:22.681 --> 07:25.250
I'm not running.

07:25.284 --> 07:26.718
- I know, you were good.
- Hop in.

07:26.752 --> 07:28.219
The others were running.

07:28.254 --> 07:30.088
All right.

07:31.157 --> 07:33.191
So are missionaries allowed
to use cell phones now?

07:33.225 --> 07:34.225
Are you serious?

07:34.260 --> 07:36.161
They're not?

07:36.195 --> 07:38.730
Of course they are.

07:38.764 --> 07:40.765
He's not wearing a name tag.

07:44.804 --> 07:46.771
Take the kids, stay down.

07:46.806 --> 07:48.773
All right, everybody out.

07:48.808 --> 07:50.008
Change of plans.

07:50.042 --> 07:51.674
Let's go, quickly and out.

07:52.111 --> 07:54.112
That's the way, okay.

07:54.146 --> 07:55.246
Let's go.

08:19.238 --> 08:20.605
Willa!

08:20.639 --> 08:22.040
Truss!

08:26.478 --> 08:28.446
Let's go.

08:37.222 --> 08:39.724
You're okay. You're okay.

08:43.576 --> 08:46.472
Security threat
level is now threatcon Charlie.

08:46.507 --> 08:48.341
The Hunters are
planning a nuclear attack,

08:48.375 --> 08:49.509
but we have nothing.

08:49.543 --> 08:50.543
Okay, I'm on it.

08:50.577 --> 08:51.644
We are we with support?

08:51.678 --> 08:54.414
DSP satellites and the PAWS radar array

08:54.448 --> 08:56.916
are monitoring the airspace
that Hunters tried to clear.

08:56.950 --> 08:58.584
I want updates on the tens.

08:58.619 --> 09:00.586
We're you able to
track this morning's breach?

09:00.621 --> 09:02.910
Agent Regan tired to cover her tracks.

09:03.036 --> 09:04.524
She's using an old operating system.

09:04.558 --> 09:06.559
She probably pickup
a second-hand laptop.

09:06.593 --> 09:08.594
But it's definitely her.

09:08.629 --> 09:11.397
Should I notify Commander Jackson?

09:11.432 --> 09:15.668
Steph, are you aware of what
happened to your predecessor?

09:15.702 --> 09:18.137
Jules leaked critical information

09:18.172 --> 09:20.640
while under Commander Jackson's watch.

09:20.674 --> 09:25.111
We cannot allow that
scenario to repeat itself.

09:25.145 --> 09:26.679
So you will report directly to me

09:26.713 --> 09:28.255
on Agent Regan's whereabouts.

09:28.418 --> 09:30.689
Only me, understood?

09:30.961 --> 09:34.922
Yes, ma'am.

09:47.167 --> 09:48.701
Ahh!

09:48.735 --> 09:50.670
- Are you trying to kill me?
- Sorry.

09:50.704 --> 09:51.894
Liana should be doing this.

09:51.895 --> 09:56.415
I need Liana to finalize the operations.

09:56.450 --> 09:57.783
Maybe we should delay the Purge.

09:57.818 --> 09:59.652
We can't.

09:59.686 --> 10:01.220
The humans are closing in.

10:01.255 --> 10:02.255
But you're not well.

10:02.289 --> 10:03.523
And you're not getting better.

10:04.758 --> 10:06.726
They did something to me

10:06.760 --> 10:08.528
at the hotel.

10:08.562 --> 10:11.764
They released a biological weapon,

10:11.798 --> 10:14.400
or a virus, something into the air.

10:16.770 --> 10:18.304
The humans want my body.

10:18.338 --> 10:20.273
Because you can heal yourself?

10:20.307 --> 10:22.642
Except I can't now.

10:22.676 --> 10:24.443
No, for other purposes.

10:24.478 --> 10:26.879
The entirety of Hunter knowledge.

10:26.914 --> 10:30.716
Culture, language, technology.

10:30.751 --> 10:33.719
Everything that Hunters are or will be

10:33.754 --> 10:35.755
is contained inside me.

10:37.824 --> 10:42.328
The humans want my core.

10:42.362 --> 10:45.331
McCarthy must be helping them.

10:46.500 --> 10:49.869
That is why he disappeared.

10:49.903 --> 10:51.137
The snake.

10:55.142 --> 10:57.376
There are traitors everywhere.

11:00.714 --> 11:02.548
Perhaps amongst us.

11:04.451 --> 11:07.520
Gather everyone, I must
determine their loyalty.

11:07.554 --> 11:08.888
You're not well, you should rest.

11:08.922 --> 11:10.656
Now.

11:15.462 --> 11:19.665
The last call was eight minutes ago.

11:22.636 --> 11:25.638
Cell number pings to here.

11:25.672 --> 11:27.473
A medical center.

11:27.507 --> 11:29.308
We shouldn't be handling
this without backup.

11:29.343 --> 11:31.577
You think Jackson is
gonna help either of us now?

11:31.612 --> 11:33.246
He's out of the ETU.

11:33.280 --> 11:34.780
Yeah, well, helping you escape

11:34.815 --> 11:36.449
was probably not the best career move.

11:36.483 --> 11:39.352
I never thanked you for that.

11:40.887 --> 11:42.288
Still haven't.

11:45.425 --> 11:47.460
I'm just relieved no one was hurt.

11:47.494 --> 11:49.662
Where's your family now?

11:49.696 --> 11:52.665
- They're safe.
- But you're not.

11:52.699 --> 11:54.500
Where are you? I'll send protection.

11:54.534 --> 11:55.768
I'm mobile.

11:55.802 --> 11:59.171
The Hunters tried to kill my family.

12:00.674 --> 12:02.708
They used a sonic bomb
similar to one they used

12:02.743 --> 12:05.344
in D.C. Mall.

12:05.379 --> 12:07.446
I was out of line at the hotel.

12:07.481 --> 12:10.116
Yes. You were.

12:10.150 --> 12:11.751
Fu...

12:11.785 --> 12:12.852
I want back in.

12:12.886 --> 12:14.402
Well, I'd be lying if I said

12:14.403 --> 12:16.455
I couldn't use your help.

12:16.490 --> 12:18.791
But I cannot have you
undermine my decisions.

12:18.825 --> 12:21.894
No, of course not, I... I was wrong.

12:21.928 --> 12:24.330
I want you to know I completely
accept whatever it's gonna take

12:24.364 --> 12:25.631
to win this war.

12:25.666 --> 12:29.702
Well, I'm very glad to hear that.

12:29.736 --> 12:30.816
Remember the Marshall farm?

12:33.407 --> 12:34.874
Safe house off Route 41.

12:34.908 --> 12:37.310
I'll meet you there. One hour.

12:38.712 --> 12:39.945
I'll see you then.

12:40.781 --> 12:43.349
And, Ruth...

12:43.383 --> 12:44.583
Yes?

12:44.618 --> 12:46.752
Thank you.

12:46.787 --> 12:52.325
I'm just glad you're back.

13:07.808 --> 13:09.642
Passenger seat.

13:09.676 --> 13:10.843
That's one of Karp's guards.

13:10.877 --> 13:12.812
Karp must be in the back.

13:12.846 --> 13:14.347
Let's go get him.

13:20.061 --> 13:21.654
I'll lure them out of the car.

13:21.688 --> 13:23.556
You grab Karp.

13:28.628 --> 13:31.197
Hey, asshole, take it easy!

13:31.231 --> 13:33.899
- You're driving too close.
- What's your problem, man?

13:45.712 --> 13:46.879
Where's Karp?

13:46.913 --> 13:48.614
My dad?

13:48.648 --> 13:51.150
We got his kid.

13:51.184 --> 13:52.351
Where's your dad?

13:52.386 --> 13:54.420
He's sick, look at him.

13:55.789 --> 13:57.323
We got to move.

13:57.357 --> 13:58.424
Come on out.

14:05.910 --> 14:08.147
Which number is your dad's?

14:08.181 --> 14:11.917
He's gonna kill you... both.

14:11.951 --> 14:14.753
Pablo, in case you haven't noticed,

14:14.788 --> 14:17.089
we got the leverage here.

14:17.123 --> 14:19.113
And in case you haven't noticed,

14:19.240 --> 14:21.099
I'm already dying.

14:21.363 --> 14:23.999
Tell me his number.

14:24.075 --> 14:26.432
You've got the phone, figured out.

14:26.466 --> 14:27.933
Ugh, little shit.

14:32.799 --> 14:36.642
You, uh, want to watch some TV?

14:36.676 --> 14:39.164
Uh, some porn, sure.

14:40.358 --> 14:42.047
So what's wrong with you?

14:43.750 --> 14:47.953
Leukemia. And I went off my meds.

14:47.987 --> 14:51.457
I'm no doctor, but that
sounds like a bad idea.

14:51.491 --> 14:54.880
Yeah, well, I've got to clean
my system for a new treatment.

14:54.882 --> 14:56.662
It's like super advanced.

14:57.817 --> 15:00.999
My dad says the
injection is gonna cure my cancer.

15:01.034 --> 15:04.002
Injection... of what?

15:04.037 --> 15:07.606
I don't know, but
nobody's ever tried it.

15:07.640 --> 15:08.888
Ever.

15:09.016 --> 15:11.143
I'm the first.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.923
Karp took some of my blood.

15:19.109 --> 15:21.424
Hunters heal faster than humans.

15:21.561 --> 15:23.041
But it doesn't mean that Hunter blood

15:23.056 --> 15:24.423
can cure cancer.

15:24.457 --> 15:27.459
If it were my kid, I'd try anything too.

15:32.487 --> 15:36.690
Pablo, we don't want
you getting any sicker.

15:36.724 --> 15:39.960
Then let me go, that might help.

15:39.994 --> 15:43.263
We will, I promise.

15:43.298 --> 15:45.799
And then you can take your new
treatment and get better.

15:47.368 --> 15:49.403
Just as soon as we talk to your dad.

15:51.205 --> 15:53.607
What I'm saying is we need
as much liquid as possible.

15:53.641 --> 15:57.411
Hard assets. Gold. Cash.

15:58.946 --> 16:02.215
We'll hold till the fallout's cleared

16:02.250 --> 16:03.850
and the market's back up.

16:05.953 --> 16:09.690
Pablo, you all right?

16:09.724 --> 16:11.792
It's almost time for your treatment.

16:11.826 --> 16:13.727
The treatment is on hold.

16:13.761 --> 16:15.649
Who is this?

16:15.854 --> 16:17.364
Oh, you don't recognize my voice.

16:17.398 --> 16:19.900
I'm disappointed, Karp.

16:19.934 --> 16:23.203
I though Liana was supposed to kill you.

16:23.237 --> 16:24.371
Tell me where the launch is

16:24.405 --> 16:25.472
and your boy lives.

16:25.506 --> 16:26.773
Fu... you.

16:26.808 --> 16:29.343
I want to talk to my son, put him on.

16:32.880 --> 16:34.214
Dad.

16:34.248 --> 16:35.515
Are you okay?

16:35.550 --> 16:36.783
Did they hurt you?

16:36.818 --> 16:39.686
No, I'm okay, but they're assholes.

16:39.721 --> 16:42.189
Where's the launch?

16:42.223 --> 16:46.360
I want my son released to me in person.

16:46.394 --> 16:47.728
And then I'll tell you.

16:47.762 --> 16:49.129
I don't have time for that.

16:49.163 --> 16:51.498
This is non-negotiable.

16:54.402 --> 16:56.136
I'll text an address where we can meet.

16:56.170 --> 16:57.504
Now, listen, Regan.

16:57.538 --> 17:00.273
You hurt my son and I
will slaughter everyone

17:00.308 --> 17:02.476
you ever met in your entire life.

17:10.651 --> 17:12.618
What?

17:12.653 --> 17:15.222
Liana's daughter has got my son.

17:15.256 --> 17:17.557
You want to partner up,

17:17.592 --> 17:19.358
you show me what you got to offer.

17:20.672 --> 17:23.981
_

17:51.543 --> 17:53.377
The cavalry's arrived.

17:54.713 --> 17:56.247
Good to see you, Briggs.

17:56.281 --> 17:57.515
You too, sir.

17:57.549 --> 18:00.051
Heard what the
Guanos tried to pull on you.

18:00.085 --> 18:03.487
Yeah, retaliation for the hotel.

18:03.522 --> 18:04.622
Well, that's ironic.

18:04.656 --> 18:06.390
How so?

18:06.425 --> 18:07.865
You tried to stop it from happening.

18:12.564 --> 18:13.531
Where's Finnerman?

18:13.565 --> 18:15.800
She's on her way.

18:15.834 --> 18:17.768
Didn't want to take any chances.

18:17.803 --> 18:19.737
Sent me to watch your back.

18:19.771 --> 18:22.340
Good, I could use the company.

18:22.374 --> 18:24.275
Let's get inside.

18:29.281 --> 18:33.217
Pablo, did you bring any
medication with you?

18:33.251 --> 18:35.453
Just the injection.

18:40.892 --> 18:42.232
I don't feel so good.

18:43.829 --> 18:46.397
Hey, hey, hey.

18:47.699 --> 18:49.200
What do we do?

18:49.234 --> 18:50.701
It's a seizure, we got
to keep him on his side.

18:50.736 --> 18:52.770
We could use the injection.

18:52.804 --> 18:54.672
We can't make him a guinea
pig for an experimental drug.

18:54.706 --> 18:57.108
But if we don't anything, he might die.

18:59.711 --> 19:01.579
We're no better than Musa

19:01.613 --> 19:03.147
if we gamble with this kid's life.

19:03.181 --> 19:07.051
He's no use to us dead.

19:07.085 --> 19:08.452
Is he?

19:17.462 --> 19:19.830
How do you like your coffee?

19:19.865 --> 19:23.134
Black.

19:23.168 --> 19:25.336
Any news on the launch location?

19:25.370 --> 19:28.139
Nothing yet.

19:28.173 --> 19:29.373
Still searching.

19:29.408 --> 19:32.476
Well, that's no
good. Time's running out.

19:32.511 --> 19:36.781
I'm sure Finnerman will
have a contingency plan.

19:36.815 --> 19:38.682
She always does.

19:44.489 --> 19:46.290
Up, soldier.

19:48.727 --> 19:50.327
How'd you know?

19:50.362 --> 19:52.296
I suspect Finnerman when
the bomb went off.

19:52.330 --> 19:54.832
I knew for certain the
minute she sent me here.

19:54.866 --> 19:56.700
Regan was right.

19:56.735 --> 19:58.335
You're Finnerman's boy.

19:58.370 --> 20:01.272
You could've killed me when I drove up.

20:01.306 --> 20:04.475
Wanted to make sure.

20:04.509 --> 20:06.544
Wouldn't want to kill an innocent man.

20:06.578 --> 20:08.312
Nobody's innocent.

20:08.346 --> 20:10.057
My family is.

20:31.515 --> 20:33.581
Doesn't look like Hunter blood.

20:33.616 --> 20:36.217
It's Hunter blood all right,
they just did something to it.

20:36.251 --> 20:37.719
You sure about this?

20:37.753 --> 20:41.756
No. But he was gonna inject it anyway.

20:41.790 --> 20:44.859
If we don't help him, he's going to die.

20:54.937 --> 20:55.937
Where are you going?

20:55.971 --> 20:57.772
To get a decent WiFi signal.

20:57.806 --> 20:59.841
Now that we have Karp's cell
number, I can track him.

20:59.875 --> 21:01.676
See when he's getting close.

21:01.710 --> 21:03.678
Well, let's hope Pablo gets better

21:03.712 --> 21:04.832
before dear old dad arrives.

21:04.847 --> 21:06.981
Or we'll get nothing out of Karp.

21:16.859 --> 21:18.960
Emme, sweetie,
there's a call for you.

21:18.994 --> 21:23.431
There you go.

21:24.800 --> 21:25.933
Hello.

21:25.968 --> 21:27.802
Hey, Emme, it's me.

21:27.836 --> 21:29.504
Why didn't you call my cell?

21:29.538 --> 21:32.206
I, uh, lost my phone

21:32.241 --> 21:34.409
and couldn't remember your new number.

21:34.443 --> 21:35.643
I'm sorry.

21:37.346 --> 21:38.479
You okay?

21:38.514 --> 21:40.915
Yes, why wouldn't I be?

21:40.949 --> 21:42.450
- Are you?
- Of course.

21:42.484 --> 21:45.253
I'm just checking in.

21:45.287 --> 21:47.622
We haven't talked since...

21:47.656 --> 21:51.392
Since Abby. You can't even say her name.

21:52.828 --> 21:54.829
I don't care if your
if you're mad at her.

21:54.863 --> 21:56.431
I still love her.

21:57.666 --> 21:59.801
It's very confusing.

21:59.835 --> 22:01.703
One day she's supposed to be dead,

22:01.737 --> 22:02.970
then she's not.

22:03.005 --> 22:05.740
And now she's... something else.

22:05.774 --> 22:07.208
- Emme.
- I know.

22:07.242 --> 22:09.937
I know.

22:11.847 --> 22:16.217
Part of my brain understands
intellectually what's going on.

22:16.251 --> 22:20.588
But the other part is sad and lonely.

22:20.622 --> 22:24.325
And I just want her to come home.

22:24.359 --> 22:27.862
But she's not coming home, is she?

22:27.896 --> 22:32.834
I don't know.

22:32.868 --> 22:35.670
I'm just trying to do what's right by us.

22:35.704 --> 22:39.707
You have to believe that.

22:39.742 --> 22:41.242
I'll see you soon.

22:41.276 --> 22:44.412
I hope so.

22:48.217 --> 22:49.684
We're close...

22:49.718 --> 22:53.821
to ending over 30 years of toil.

22:53.856 --> 22:58.259
Three long decades on this cold planet,

22:58.293 --> 23:00.428
but no more.

23:00.462 --> 23:04.966
We've worked so
hard. Sacrificed so much.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.502
Our time has come.

23:07.536 --> 23:10.271
We won't let anything stop us.

23:10.305 --> 23:13.241
We can already tell Hunters from humans.

23:13.275 --> 23:15.443
This is a demonstration of loyalty.

23:15.477 --> 23:17.411
We must be comforted

23:17.446 --> 23:21.415
that no humans walk among us.

23:21.450 --> 23:24.952
Only the loyal will Purge.

24:17.906 --> 24:18.940
One of us.

24:23.612 --> 24:27.882
Now, everyone else,
prove yourselves as our kind.

24:51.440 --> 24:52.473
Anything?

24:52.507 --> 24:53.875
His fever's gone.

24:53.909 --> 24:55.509
Karp?

24:55.544 --> 24:57.411
We'll me him soon.

24:57.446 --> 24:59.247
What are we going to do about the kid?

24:59.281 --> 25:04.252
We stall him until, uh, Pablo wakes up.

25:04.286 --> 25:05.453
If he wakes up.

25:05.487 --> 25:07.922
The Purge isn't going to wait

25:07.956 --> 25:09.290
so neither should we.

25:09.324 --> 25:11.859
We don't have a choice.

25:20.435 --> 25:21.435
Hey.

25:21.470 --> 25:23.437
Hey.

25:23.472 --> 25:24.705
How are you doing?

25:26.008 --> 25:27.642
You gave me the injection?

25:27.676 --> 25:28.776
We did.

25:28.810 --> 25:31.312
You feeling any better?

25:38.387 --> 25:39.654
I feel good.

25:39.688 --> 25:41.889
All right, just take it easy.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.860
Actually, you look good.

25:45.894 --> 25:47.161
Don't encourage him.

25:47.195 --> 25:48.462
No, but I can feel it.

25:48.497 --> 25:50.598
The cancer's gone.

25:52.234 --> 25:53.601
Woo!

25:54.603 --> 25:55.636
Oh, my God.

25:56.838 --> 25:58.673
Did we just cure cancer?

25:58.707 --> 26:00.441
This is amazing!

26:00.475 --> 26:02.476
This is amazing!

26:02.511 --> 26:05.413
Thank you! Thank you!

26:06.248 --> 26:07.415
Yeah, sure.

26:07.449 --> 26:10.184
I'm gonna tell my dad you saved my life.

26:10.218 --> 26:12.520
He'll give you anything you want now.

26:12.554 --> 26:14.488
Now we're talking.

26:15.524 --> 26:16.524
Hey?

26:16.558 --> 26:18.426
It burns...

26:20.462 --> 26:21.829
No, no, no, no, no!

26:23.265 --> 26:25.199
Oh, Pablo, shit.

26:25.233 --> 26:26.873
One, two, three, four.
He's not breathing.

26:26.902 --> 26:28.643
No, Pablo, no!

26:32.507 --> 26:33.741
I didn't push that hard.

26:35.510 --> 26:38.391
Oh, shit.

27:01.536 --> 27:05.539
There's only one way out
of here to you, Jackson.

27:05.574 --> 27:07.975
You know that better than anyone.

27:31.767 --> 27:33.768
It's nothing personal.

27:33.802 --> 27:35.302
Just following protocol?

27:35.337 --> 27:38.639
ETU started out this way.

27:38.673 --> 27:41.609
Containment no matter the cost or loses.

27:41.643 --> 27:44.211
I had nothing to do with the bombing.

27:44.246 --> 27:46.380
Don't think being Finnerman's boy

27:46.415 --> 27:48.349
offers you any sort of protection.

27:53.722 --> 27:55.389
I don't care if I die.

27:55.424 --> 27:58.592
You have no attachment to this world

27:58.627 --> 28:00.394
because Hunters
killed the one you loved.

28:00.429 --> 28:02.797
Now, you make my wife a
widow, you will destroy her

28:02.831 --> 28:05.366
as surely as if you killed her.

28:05.400 --> 28:07.501
My children, my grandchildren too.

28:07.536 --> 28:09.870
You hate the
Hunters, but if you kill me...

28:11.306 --> 28:13.674
you're no better than they are.

28:20.682 --> 28:22.249
I hope Karp shows.

28:22.284 --> 28:25.753
It's all for
nothing if he doesn't.

28:27.756 --> 28:29.657
Look, it wasn't our fault.

28:29.691 --> 28:31.859
Pablo had terminal cancer.

28:31.893 --> 28:34.862
And he was gonna take
the injection anyway.

28:34.896 --> 28:37.164
But it was my blood that killed him.

28:37.199 --> 28:40.201
No. You were trying to help him.

28:42.337 --> 28:44.472
If anyone's to blame, it's Karp.

28:44.506 --> 28:45.739
Where did he get the dumb idea

28:45.774 --> 28:49.210
to inject his son with
Hunter blood anyway?

28:49.244 --> 28:52.646
Idiot.

28:52.681 --> 28:54.148
Karp will be armed to the teeth.

28:54.182 --> 28:56.450
First thing he'll do when he gets here

28:56.485 --> 28:58.486
is look for Pablo.

28:58.520 --> 29:00.749
When he pulls up and doesn't see him,

29:00.883 --> 29:03.290
we got 10... maybe 20
seconds to take him.

29:04.326 --> 29:05.392
Here we go.

29:18.673 --> 29:19.974
Karp!

29:34.756 --> 29:36.957
Get out of the car!

29:47.669 --> 29:49.252
McCarthy?

30:00.309 --> 30:01.790
The hell you doing here, McCarthy?

30:01.824 --> 30:03.825
How's the boy?

30:03.860 --> 30:06.962
You told Karp that Hunter
blood will cure his son.

30:06.996 --> 30:10.699
Might've cured him.
But I ain't no doctor.

30:11.734 --> 30:12.701
Piece of shit.

30:12.735 --> 30:14.236
Careful now.

30:14.270 --> 30:15.237
That thing's loaded.

30:15.271 --> 30:16.972
What do you want?

30:17.006 --> 30:20.375
I want what you want, to stop Musa.

30:20.410 --> 30:22.344
Bullshit.

30:22.378 --> 30:23.946
Why the change of heart?

30:23.980 --> 30:27.015
You know, shoot yourself
up with a few junkies

30:27.050 --> 30:28.970
and you're no longer
welcomed at the diner table.

30:30.320 --> 30:32.054
I got the boot from team Musa.

30:33.256 --> 30:34.957
Exiled like some E.T. Polanksi.

30:34.991 --> 30:37.826
Kicked to curb, yo.

30:37.860 --> 30:40.963
But Victor Karp, now, that
is a man with vision, huh?

30:40.997 --> 30:42.130
He saw my potential.

30:42.165 --> 30:43.699
And I saw his.

30:43.733 --> 30:45.767
I think we got ahead
together, what do you say?

30:50.473 --> 30:51.873
I'll tell you where launch is.

30:51.908 --> 30:52.908
In exchange, I get immunity.

30:52.942 --> 30:54.042
How about in exchange

30:54.077 --> 30:55.978
I don't shoot you in the face?

30:57.080 --> 30:59.213
You just beheaded a man.

30:59.248 --> 31:00.957
You get nothing.

31:00.958 --> 31:02.966
Hey, Karp!

31:03.098 --> 31:06.154
Where's the launch?

31:06.189 --> 31:08.323
Oh, hey, wait, where's your body?

31:12.261 --> 31:13.228
You're sick.

31:13.262 --> 31:14.997
Immunity.

31:15.031 --> 31:17.399
Or you get nothing.

31:17.433 --> 31:21.269
Screw him. He's up to something.

31:22.405 --> 31:24.906
With Karp dead, he's all we got.

31:24.941 --> 31:27.409
Tick-tock, tick-tock, little mice.

31:27.443 --> 31:32.714
Before the clock strikes
12 and Earth goes boom!

31:32.749 --> 31:34.049
I don't trust him.

31:35.218 --> 31:36.918
Tell us the location.

31:36.953 --> 31:39.087
If it checks out,

31:39.122 --> 31:40.422
then we talk immunity.

31:40.456 --> 31:43.325
See, here's the thing.

31:43.359 --> 31:45.160
I'll only tell Jackson.

31:47.030 --> 31:48.063
Why?

31:48.097 --> 31:50.866
He's the only critter I trust.

31:54.370 --> 31:57.105
They have proven they are Hunter.

31:57.140 --> 32:00.208
No one can know their hearts.

32:00.243 --> 32:02.778
You feel vulnerable
because you were attacked.

32:02.812 --> 32:04.746
That was the humans.

32:04.781 --> 32:08.350
Everyone here would die for you.

32:08.384 --> 32:09.985
I know I would.

32:10.019 --> 32:11.720
You're a good soldier.

32:11.754 --> 32:14.723
Loyal to our kind.

32:14.757 --> 32:17.159
Steadfast.

32:19.762 --> 32:20.762
Unlike myself.

32:20.797 --> 32:22.631
You are our Brother.

32:22.665 --> 32:27.069
I gather my people like a
shepherd herds his flock.

32:28.438 --> 32:31.673
But I have lead them to the slaughter.

32:33.676 --> 32:35.343
They're going to sabotage the launch.

32:35.378 --> 32:39.314
Musa, the ETU doesn't know where we are.

32:39.348 --> 32:41.026
We're safe.

32:41.155 --> 32:44.886
No. Not the ETU.

32:44.921 --> 32:46.688
There's a greater threat.

32:48.091 --> 32:49.825
I thought they were all dead,

32:49.859 --> 32:52.360
but they're not.

32:52.395 --> 32:54.096
They're here.

32:54.130 --> 32:55.731
Who's here?

32:55.765 --> 32:58.233
The Exalted.

33:01.170 --> 33:02.404
It's time.

33:28.264 --> 33:30.198
We are going home.

33:44.347 --> 33:46.014
Karp's son, Pablo, has gone missing.

33:46.048 --> 33:48.884
But his phone logged its most
recent call near Baltimore.

33:48.918 --> 33:50.719
My theory,

33:50.753 --> 33:53.088
Regan wants Karp, she finds the kid,

33:53.122 --> 33:54.723
holds him as leverage.

33:55.131 --> 33:57.032
Supposition.

33:57.066 --> 33:59.801
Hence theory.

33:59.836 --> 34:02.204
Fairly certain that's a synonym.

34:02.238 --> 34:05.474
Where exactly is Karp Junior's phone?

34:05.508 --> 34:10.478
You believe Regan has it on her now?

34:10.513 --> 34:13.282
Agent Regan has become a
liability to this unit.

34:13.315 --> 34:15.684
A containment issue.

34:15.717 --> 34:18.620
Would that stop you from
giving me the coordinates

34:18.655 --> 34:21.089
of her currently whereabouts?

34:21.123 --> 34:24.025
No, ma'am. It's my job.

34:24.060 --> 34:27.295
The Hunters must be stopped.

34:27.330 --> 34:29.598
We do what has to be done.

34:51.387 --> 34:52.688
This is just...

34:52.722 --> 34:55.224
It's unbelievable.

34:55.257 --> 34:56.525
And a grave threat.

34:57.827 --> 34:59.461
We don't know where they came from,

34:59.495 --> 35:01.730
what they want, how many there are.

35:01.764 --> 35:03.498
We know nothing about these creatures.

35:03.533 --> 35:05.434
Except that they're deadly hunters.

35:05.468 --> 35:07.502
They slaughtered our soldiers like sheep.

35:07.537 --> 35:08.804
Tore their guts out.

35:08.838 --> 35:11.540
Truss, you and I've
been fighting side-by-side

35:11.574 --> 35:13.075
for 20 years.

35:13.109 --> 35:15.310
Communists, extremists, terrorists.

35:15.345 --> 35:17.079
Now I need you to help fight

35:17.113 --> 35:18.680
whatever the hell this damn thing is.

35:18.715 --> 35:21.049
I'll do whatever it takes.

35:21.084 --> 35:22.484
I know you will.

35:22.518 --> 35:26.255
Well, whatever did this
was injured in the fight,

35:26.289 --> 35:31.493
escaped but didn't get far.

35:31.527 --> 35:33.462
And the shepherd found the body?

35:33.496 --> 35:36.064
And witnessed the attack.

35:36.099 --> 35:38.200
If he talks and it gets
back to local authorities,

35:38.234 --> 35:39.434
it'll be difficult to contain.

35:41.404 --> 35:42.571
We can't let this get out.

35:42.605 --> 35:46.141
No, we can't.

35:46.175 --> 35:47.643
Echo Protocol.

37:26.782 --> 37:30.271
Briggs betrayed me.

37:30.645 --> 37:32.346
Take a seat, Ruth.

37:43.525 --> 37:45.426
Briggs was loyal.

37:45.460 --> 37:49.263
I told him we'd work it out and
I appealed to his conscious.

37:49.297 --> 37:52.666
You remember what that is, right?

37:52.701 --> 37:54.902
I did what I had to do.

37:56.237 --> 37:59.440
My family, Ruth.

37:59.474 --> 38:00.808
My wife.

38:00.842 --> 38:03.310
My grandchildren.

38:03.345 --> 38:05.746
That was a complication.

38:05.780 --> 38:08.882
That was not my intention, I assure you.

38:08.917 --> 38:12.686
You dressed an agent as a missionary.

38:12.721 --> 38:14.855
He was under clear
instructions to avoid civilian...

38:14.889 --> 38:18.492
In the parking lot of
my place of worship.

38:18.526 --> 38:22.496
Well, for what it's worth, I'm
sorry it happed that way.

38:22.530 --> 38:26.667
From day one, we've
been killing the innocent

38:26.701 --> 38:29.403
just to protect a secret.

38:29.437 --> 38:30.704
To protect a nation.

38:32.540 --> 38:35.843
I will not apologize for
defending my country.

38:35.877 --> 38:37.378
It's my duty.

38:37.412 --> 38:40.114
And you above all
people should understand that.

38:40.148 --> 38:41.582
But at what cost?

38:41.616 --> 38:43.384
At any cost.

38:44.586 --> 38:45.886
Our lives.

38:45.920 --> 38:48.322
Our future. Our way of life.

38:48.356 --> 38:49.857
The dirtier we fight,

38:49.891 --> 38:52.292
the more I wonder if
we're worth defending.

38:52.327 --> 38:54.128
Don't give me that Nietzsche bullshit.

38:54.162 --> 38:57.531
We're not becoming
monsters fighting monsters.

38:57.565 --> 39:00.801
We are doing
precisely what needs to be done

39:00.835 --> 39:03.737
in the defense of a country.

39:03.772 --> 39:06.573
Like my father did and
his father before him.

39:08.243 --> 39:11.145
What you perceive as compromise,

39:11.179 --> 39:15.149
future generations will
see as sacrifice.

39:15.183 --> 39:16.250
You and I are heroes.

39:16.284 --> 39:18.919
And if we're really lucky,

39:18.953 --> 39:22.489
the world will never even
know what we've done for them.

39:22.524 --> 39:25.693
Heroes don't kill innocent people.

39:25.727 --> 39:28.629
They do what needs to be done

39:28.663 --> 39:33.667
despite the cost to their
conscious or otherwise.

39:37.539 --> 39:39.673
Let's find another way.

39:46.247 --> 39:47.314
Truss.

39:48.783 --> 39:51.251
There is no place for compassion

39:51.286 --> 39:52.686
against this enemy.

39:57.892 --> 39:59.259
You know there was a time

39:59.294 --> 40:01.328
when you could make the hard decisions.

40:01.362 --> 40:03.964
But you can't anymore and that's okay.

40:03.998 --> 40:06.900
There's no shame in that.

40:06.935 --> 40:10.871
But I can still make those decisions.

40:10.905 --> 40:14.374
It's the only way we're
gonna win this war.

40:17.812 --> 40:19.580
You're right. You're right.

40:23.585 --> 40:25.452
I'm sorry, Ruth.
