00:02.228 --> 00:04.319
And finally, this year's
most powerful woman

00:04.338 --> 00:07.581
in business, Paula Clark.

00:07.733 --> 00:09.416
<i> (soft music)</i>

00:09.510 --> 00:12.177
-The Executioner.
-PAULA: Thank you for this.

00:12.370 --> 00:15.347
I'm often asked how to have
a successful career

00:15.499 --> 00:18.517
as a woman in this industry,
and the first thing I'd say is,

00:18.668 --> 00:21.353
forget everything you know
about being a woman.

00:21.505 --> 00:25.507
The companies that survive
in a ruthless marketplace

00:25.601 --> 00:29.269
are the efficient ones,
not the nice ones.

00:29.363 --> 00:32.197
Inefficiency is the tumor
you need to excise,

00:32.349 --> 00:34.015
in order to save the rest.

00:34.035 --> 00:36.201
And yes, sometimes
that means layoffs,

00:36.370 --> 00:41.098
but business is
about hard decisions.

00:41.116 --> 00:43.709
I know that some people call me
The Executioner.

00:43.860 --> 00:45.377
That's not accurate.

00:45.604 --> 00:51.608
I'm a surgeon, and when I do
my job, the patient thrives.

00:51.627 --> 00:52.943
Thank you.

00:52.961 --> 00:59.224
(applause)

01:01.453 --> 01:04.805

01:22.474 --> 01:23.974
Think that's what
you're talking about, the cane.

01:24.067 --> 01:26.143
A lot of people
use canes, Monica.

01:26.236 --> 01:27.661
Winston Churchill had a cane.

01:27.813 --> 01:28.995
Scrooge McDuck, Willy Wonka.

-Charlie Chaplin.
-Hugh Laurie,<i> House.</i>

-DANTE: So ripped.
-Ripped?

01:37.339 --> 01:39.506
-I hate all of you.
-So the deal for today.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.508
Jessica and Dante are gonna be
taking half the cast off site.

01:41.602 --> 01:44.103
This is a heartwarming
background package.

01:44.254 --> 01:46.271
I want nostalgia, I want
tearful high school memories,

01:46.498 --> 01:47.422
I want a nap just thinking
about it,

01:47.441 --> 01:49.090
but, guys,
we gotta make it pop.

That's about it--the rest
of us are gonna be here.

01:50.853 --> 01:52.594
Monica, you can lead rehearsal,
and try not to take out any

01:52.613 --> 01:53.837
knees or eyes with that thing.

01:53.930 --> 01:55.172
Should be an easy day, guys.
Let's get to it.

01:55.190 --> 01:56.506
Nick, a word?

01:56.525 --> 01:58.175
Alan, we just
letting 'em in now?

01:58.193 --> 02:00.953
Is that what's happening?

02:01.180 --> 02:03.122
Hey, all right.

02:03.349 --> 02:06.183
Here, you know what?
Have a seat, please.

02:06.201 --> 02:09.035
I've recently learned
some concerning information

02:09.130 --> 02:11.296
about my employment history

02:11.448 --> 02:13.114
vis-à-vis Mike's
employment history.

02:13.134 --> 02:15.542
-Oh, yeah, what's that?
-I know you already know.

02:15.694 --> 02:20.364
I do, The Executioner.
Hoo-hoo, I'm shaking.

02:20.382 --> 02:22.032
I want to be the one
to tell him in person.

02:22.050 --> 02:23.291
Sure, of course.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.810
I'll set up an SDI
for the two of you guys today.

02:24.961 --> 02:26.311
No.

02:26.463 --> 02:28.480
I want to tell him off-camera
before I tell him on-camera.

02:28.707 --> 02:30.149
No, come on, no can do.
You signed a contract.

02:30.300 --> 02:32.709
We get to film anything
and everything deemed important

02:32.728 --> 02:35.045
to the<i> Big Leap</i> story,
and this is very important.

02:35.138 --> 02:38.806
Right, okay.
That makes sense.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.141
I agree.

02:40.235 --> 02:44.404
Oh, we got a runner!
Make a V formation!

02:44.498 --> 02:45.980
-STAFFER: What is that?
-ALLY: Cut her off!

02:46.000 --> 02:47.557
-Mike!
-NICK: Cut her off!

02:47.576 --> 02:49.743
Don't do this.
We can talk about it!

-Mike!

02:54.249 --> 02:55.465
I have off-brand shoes.

02:57.661 --> 02:59.178
Nice, Ally.

02:59.329 --> 03:00.921
Hey, make sure you take
her phone.

03:01.089 --> 03:02.239
She is on hard ice
from now on.

03:02.332 --> 03:03.849
Hey, anybody got eyes on Mike?

03:04.000 --> 03:06.259
MIKE: Oh, love cottage cheese.

03:06.353 --> 03:10.096
It's like my favorite cheese,
which I know is weird,

03:10.249 --> 03:13.583
but, like,
it's not just for babies--oof!

03:13.677 --> 03:17.863
You look extra bulgy today.
Is that for me?

03:18.090 --> 03:19.347
I just ramped up my workouts.

03:19.441 --> 03:20.866
You know, trying to get back
in football shape.

03:21.093 --> 03:22.275
BRITTNEY: Well, I like it.

03:22.369 --> 03:25.429
Mm, just want to show you off.

03:25.447 --> 03:27.021
We should go to Tulum
next year.

03:27.190 --> 03:29.115
-Next year?
-Yeah.

03:29.210 --> 03:30.600
Between filming
and your football season,

03:30.619 --> 03:33.770
we won't be able to leave
till, what, February?

03:33.863 --> 03:36.440
But that's okay.

03:36.458 --> 03:39.534
-Gabby, you're staring.
-Sorry, sorry.

03:39.553 --> 03:42.537
It's just that he hasn't,
you know, acknowledged

03:42.706 --> 03:46.541
what I said the other day
about him, and love, and me.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.377
Yeah, maybe he's just
processing all that,

03:49.504 --> 03:53.381
but who cares?
Because you're famous.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.308
Hey, did they tell you
what we're doing today?

03:55.402 --> 03:57.569

-What are we doing here?
-Background package.

04:20.486 --> 04:21.927
You're gonna meet
with your old dance team,

04:22.078 --> 04:23.320
teach them
your state-winning dance,

04:23.413 --> 04:25.246
do some interviews,
some B-roll,

04:25.266 --> 04:27.991
and give them this giant check,
easy-peasy.

04:28.084 --> 04:29.268

this huge-ass check.

04:50.032 --> 04:53.350
Oh, it's--it's very surprising
to be here.

04:53.368 --> 04:54.776
Wouldn't have minded
a heads-up,

04:54.870 --> 04:58.446
but follow your dreams.

04:58.540 --> 05:02.283

Hey, I quit that job
three weeks ago.

05:06.048 --> 05:07.288

choreograph anything like this.

was the one doing all the work

09:48.997 --> 09:50.589

09:50.740 --> 09:54.500
but also loyal,
kind, thoughtful.

to your favorite teacher?

18:56.285 --> 18:57.635
Okay.

at the end of an interview.

19:01.032 --> 19:02.423
-And Gabby quit the show.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.291

is going after the guy, right?

19:04.385 --> 19:06.202

and a camera.

19:06.295 --> 19:07.478

I'll get him to talk.

19:07.630 --> 19:09.129

and we get sued?

19:09.223 --> 19:10.648

public schoolteacher? Come on.

19:10.799 --> 19:12.391
And what if we don't do it,
and then it comes out?

19:12.485 --> 19:15.044
Yes, the last thing I need is
Ronan Farrow asking questions

19:15.062 --> 19:16.395

and when we knew it.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.063
Yeah, and I'll fight
Ronan Farrow every day--

19:18.216 --> 19:20.307

19:20.326 --> 19:23.977
Pro: we go after him,
he gets fired.

19:23.997 --> 19:25.997

disgusting.

19:26.224 --> 19:29.892
Sure, yes, but should
we do it or not?

19:42.573 --> 19:44.998

something incredible today.

Not to worry.

20:41.966 --> 20:44.075
Everything else
is sailing along.

20:44.302 --> 20:46.077
I've arranged for the dancers
to arrive from the stages.

20:46.304 --> 20:47.245
They're learning
the choreo now.

20:47.472 --> 20:49.080
I've already cleared the song.

And the worst day of Larry's.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.148

I don't know.

20:59.166 --> 21:00.925

and then Zoe still says no?

21:04.413 --> 21:07.339

She said she liked me.

21:07.492 --> 21:09.249
Well, how do you know
she meant it, hmm?

21:09.343 --> 21:11.160
Well, what if she changed
her mind and didn't tell you?

21:11.178 --> 21:12.511
And then when you told her
that you broke up with the girl

21:12.663 --> 21:15.014
that you were seeing,
she didn't seem to care,

21:15.166 --> 21:16.849

that told her mom

21:17.001 --> 21:18.425
that she loved you.
