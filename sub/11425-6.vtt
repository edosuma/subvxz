INFECTION CONTROL SPECIALIST.

28:47.792 --> 28:51.294
>> I DON'T SEE HIS HAND IN THE
WATER.
IT IS KIND OF IMPORTANT, I DON'T

28:51.428 --> 28:56.733
KNOW WHAT YOUR RESPONSE WAS TO
MY ASKING YOU TO HELP WITH THIS.
>> I AM HELPING.

28:56.867 --> 29:02.605

COMPLETE COMPLIANCE, YOU DON'T
DESERVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO UP

29:02.740 --> 29:07.310

HE IS JUST A [BLEEP] BABY.

29:32.036 --> 29:36.806
JOB IF YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A
CAPTAIN.
IT IS LIKE WHY DO I HAVE TO DO

29:36.941 --> 29:40.844
IT.
[BLEEP].
[BLEEP] HIM.

29:40.978 --> 29:48.918

EPSOM SALT WITH HOT WATER.
SOAK YOUR HAND, KEEP IT IN

29:49.053 --> 30:00.530
THERE, IT WILL HELP.
YOU'RE OFF THE DECK UNTIL YOU'RE
BETTER.

30:00.664 --> 30:10.240
>> [BLEEP] I AM GOING TO HAVE TO
RUN AROUND LIKE A MADMAN.
>> YOU COMING OFF DECK DOESN'T

30:10.374 --> 30:15.812
MEAN YOU'RE OFF IT, IT MEANS WE
ARE TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF THE
INFECTION.

30:15.946 --> 30:25.088

HIGHEST POT FOR THE SEASON.
>> THAT'S COUNTAGE.
EVERY POT HAS BEEN OVER 100.

31:22.112 --> 31:35.525
MORE THAN HALF OF THEM OVER 150.
IT IS PRETTY MUCH THE BEST
STRING I'VE EVER HAD EVER.

31:35.659 --> 31:45.668
>> CATCHING CRAB.
BAD TIDE, BAD WIND, SPINNING
CIRCLES ON EVERY POT I HAUL.

I AM TALKING HERE.
>> Narrator: WHILE THE CREW
WORKS SHORTHANDED, PAIR IS

32:57.875 --> 33:05.515
HEALING FROM A BODY BLOW.
>> YEAH, RETIRED.
ONE LESS PERSON ON DECK MAKES IT

33:05.649 --> 33:21.798
THAT MUCH HARDER AND SLOWER FOR
EVERYONE ELSE.
>> THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME

33:21.932 --> 33:32.675
RESENTMENT TOWARD BEAR NOW AND
ON DECK.
>> SEAN DOESN'T WANT HIM TO

33:32.810 --> 33:41.050
BECAUSE THEY'RE BUDDIES.
>> I THINK THOSE GUYS TALK TOO
MUCH OUT THERE.

33:41.185 --> 33:46.122
I THINK THAT'S [BLEEP].
I TREAT THEM LIKE ANYONE ELSE,
EVEN THOUGH HE IS MY BUDDY.

33:46.256 --> 33:54.197
HE HAS NOTHING TO COMPLAIN
ABOUT.
>> TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS, HE IS

33:54.331 --> 34:04.140
IN THERE SLEEPING AND WE ARE OUT
GETTING BAIRDI.
>> WE'RE GOING TO GO LIKE A MILE

34:04.274 --> 34:08.744
AND A HALF.
>> PROBLEM NOW IS IN BETWEEN
STRINGS, THEY HAVE TO MAKE BAIT.

34:08.879 --> 34:21.824
SO THEY DON'T GET A CHANCE FOR
REST.
>> SEE WHAT THE DEAL IS.

34:21.958 --> 34:28.464
HOPEFULLY HE IS MIRACULOUSLY
HEALED BUT I DOWNTOWN IT.
>> BEAR?

34:28.599 --> 34:33.803
HOW YOU FEEL.
>> FEELS BETTER.
>> REALLY TENDER STILL?

34:33.937 --> 34:40.176
>> JUST REALLY SORE.
>> I AM TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF
YOU NEED AN X-RAY OR NOT.

34:40.310 --> 34:47.150
WE NEED TO COVER OUR BASES.
LAST THING I WANT IS YOU TO SAY
I AM GOOD AND THERE GOES ANOTHER

34:47.284 --> 34:56.859
ONE, BUT WE HAVE AN ISSUE, TOO,
WITH OUR CRAB.
I STILL HAVE 70,000 POUNDS TO

34:56.994 --> 35:00.730

WHEN THE FISHING IS SO GOOD.

35:00.864 --> 35:07.136
>> Narrator: THE CAPTAIN HAS A
DECISION TO MAKE.
STAY ON MONSTER FISHING OR HEAD

35:07.271 --> 35:22.118

DOWN FOR SURE.

35:22.252 --> 35:31.694
>> I AM GOING TO HAVE YOU GET TO
CLINIC, GET AN X-RAY.
SEE WHAT THE VERDICT IS.

35:31.828 --> 35:40.937
WE HAVE TO PLAY IT SAFE.
WE'RE GOING TO RUN HIM IN TO ST.
PAUL, GET HIM TO THE CLINIC.

35:41.071 --> 35:49.212
IT IS CRAZY.
HAD A 185, 195, 190, 154.
IT IS TEMPTING BUT I AM NOT

35:49.346 --> 36:07.396

BUT THE CRAB KEEP COMING ON.

THEY ALL HAVE MY BACK BUT I
CAN'T HAVE THEIRS RIGHT NOW.

38:27.905 --> 38:37.347

WITH THIS.
SOMEONE GETS HURT, YOU GOT TO

38:37.481 --> 38:57.200

ALSO ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON.

40:16.580 --> 40:39.769
COULD BE A MINOR TEAR.
