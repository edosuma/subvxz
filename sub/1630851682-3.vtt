WEBVTT

00:03.036 --> 00:11.644
AND NOW A MESSAGE FROM THE
NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE

00:11.644 --> 00:17.584
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE
GOOD EVENING, GOOD EVENING.
I PREFER TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS

00:17.584 --> 00:20.787
AND I HANDLE PUBLIC RELATIONS
FOR THE NFL.
SO IF ANYONE WANTS TO SWITCH

00:20.787 --> 00:28.695
JOBS, LET ME KNOW.
NOW I'D LIKE TO BRING OUT THE
COMMISSIONER TO ADDRESS THIS

00:28.695 --> 00:30.296
WEEK'S SCANDAL
THIS IS NOT THE NFL DRAFT, BUT
IT'S STILL OKAY TO BOO HIM

00:30.296 --> 00:34.034
ROGER GOODELL.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE
[ BOOS ]

00:34.034 --> 00:39.439
YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TO BOO.
GOOD EVENING
HI, I'M ROGER GOODELL.

00:39.439 --> 00:44.811
WHEN YOU SEE ME ON TV, IT'S
NEVER GOOD
THIS TIME, ONE OF OUR COACHES IS

00:44.811 --> 00:48.581
ACCUSED OF RACISM, MISOGYNY, AND
HOMOPHOBIA
BUT HEY, AT LEAST NO ONE'S

00:48.581 --> 00:56.156
TALKING ABOUT CONCUSSIONS.
I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THE
EMAILS SENT BY RAIDERS COACH

00:56.156 --> 01:00.460
JON GRUDEN WERE HORRIFYING AND
DEEPLY OFFENSIVE, ESPECIALLY TO
ME

01:00.460 --> 01:05.899
I WAS REFERRED TO AS THE F-WORD,
THE P-WORD, THE C-WORD, THE
R-WORD, THE F'ing R-WORD, THE

01:05.899 --> 01:11.838
F'ing R-WORD P-WORD.
ONCE, WEIRDLY, I WAS CALLED A
DILL

01:11.838 --> 01:23.450
THAT WAS KIND OF SWEET
BUT I ASSURE YOU THA
ALL 32 TEAMS UNDERSTAND THAT

01:23.450 --> 01:25.085
DIVERSITY IS OUR STRENGTH.
AND I KNOW OUR BLACK COACHES
WOULD AGREE, BOTH THEM

01:25.085 --> 01:30.190
NOW COACH GRUDEN HAS ASKED TO
SAY A FEW WORDS.
I SAID, BAD IDEA

01:30.190 --> 01:37.697
BUT HE GOT ON HIS KNEES AND
BEGGED AND YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I
HATE TO SEE SOMEONE KNEELING

01:37.697 --> 01:44.237
LET'S HEAR IT ONE MORE TIME FOR
COACH GRUDEN
THANK YOU, ROGER.

01:44.237 --> 01:49.642
I'M SORRY TO ALL THE RAIDERS
FANS OUT THERE
HOPE YOU WON'T JUDGE ME ON ONE

01:49.642 --> 01:55.849
EMAIL I SENT 10 YEARS AGO, OR
THE 20 EMAILS I SENT LAST
TUESDAY.

01:55.849 --> 02:02.822
I PROMISE I DON'T HAVE A RACIST
BONE IN MY BODY.
WHEN A CALLED AN AFRICAN

02:02.822 --> 02:06.493
AMERICAN PLAYER DARK E
THAN A SKY WITH NO STARS, I
PROMISE YOU, THAT WAS IN NO WAY

02:06.493 --> 02:08.061
RACIAL
THAT WAS REFERRING TO HIS SENSE
OF HUMOR, WHICH IS EXTREMELY

02:08.061 --> 02:10.063
DARK AND EDGY.
BUT THAT SHOW "LOUIE"ON FX -
HEY WHEN'S THE NEXT SEASON

02:10.063 --> 02:13.266
COMING OUT
I ALSO CALLED THE COMMISSIONER
THE GAY F-WORD LIKE A HUNDRED

02:13.266 --> 02:18.104
TIMES.
NOW THIS SOUNDS LIKE A STRETCH
BUT IF YOU'VE EVER GOTTEN BURNED

02:18.104 --> 02:25.945
BY AUTO CORRECT.
HEAR ME OUT.
SEE, I'M A BIT OF A NAVAL BUFF

02:25.945 --> 02:28.648
AND I OFTEN SEND MY FRIENDS
EMAILS ABOUT FRIGATES, WHICH ARE
WARSHIPS

02:28.648 --> 02:34.587
I'LL SAY, LOOK AT THAT FLAMING
FRIGATE!
THAT'S WHEN A WARSHIP'S ON FIRE.

02:34.587 --> 02:39.426
OR THAT DUMBASS FRIGATE CAN S MY
D.
THAT'S ABOUT A WARSHIP

02:39.426 --> 02:42.629
PERFORMING ORAL SEX ON ANOTHER
WARSHIP.
YOU GET IT

02:42.629 --> 02:46.433
MY POINT IS, I NEVER MEANT TO
HURT ANYONE.
I MEANT TO HURT THEM SECRETLY

02:46.433 --> 02:58.611
BEHIND THEIR BACKS
APPEARANCES MATTER, SO I'LL TURN
IT OVER TO A GUY WHO'S ALL ABOUT

02:58.611 --> 03:03.083
APPEARANCES, THE RAIDERS OWNER
MARK DAVIS
HI, FOLKS

03:03.083 --> 03:07.887
MARK DAVIS HERE.
AS MY PLAYERS CALL ME, THE
BOTCHED CIRCUMCISION

03:07.887 --> 03:14.728
NO, NO
OK
LOOK

03:14.728 --> 03:16.229
GUYS, WHAT COACH GRUDEN WROTE
WAS DISGRACEFUL.
WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB

03:16.229 --> 03:23.636
WE NEED TO, AS I TELL MY BARBER,
AIM HIGHER
AND TRUST ME, I'VE HEARD ALL THE

03:23.636 --> 03:30.710
JOKES ABOUT MY HAIR AND HOW IT
LOOKS LIKE DONALD TRUMP'S
HAIRCUT GAVE ME A HAIRCUT.

03:30.710 --> 03:36.916
BUT WE'RE MAKING THIS RIGHT AND
MOVING ON.
SO I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER T

03:36.916 --> 03:38.551
OUR NEW HEAD COACH, LARRY "DON'T
MAKE ME DO THIS" RUCKER.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

03:38.551 --> 03:44.924
HEY, GUYS.
IT'S AN HONOR TO TAKE OVER THIS
STORIED FRANCHISE.

03:44.924 --> 03:51.498
AND A REAL SHAME THAT I HAVE TO
IMMEDIATELY RESIGN
THEY JUST FOUND MY EMAILS TOO,

03:51.498 --> 03:54.634
AND THEY ARE SO MUCH WORSE THAN
THE OLD COACH'S.
I PUT THE F-WORD IN THE SUBJECT

03:54.634 --> 04:02.175
LINE
I STARTED AN EMAIL CHAIN CALLED
"LET'S RANK THE RACES" AND I

04:02.175 --> 04:06.046
RESPONDED TO ALL OF COACH
GRUDEN'S EMAILS, LOL, THIS IS SO
TRUE AND FUNNY, YOU THE MAN,

04:06.046 --> 04:14.788
GRUDEN
ANYWAY, THANK YOU AND I LOOK
FORWARD TO JOINING

04:14.788 --> 04:16.056
ESPN IN THREE MONTHS
OKAY, HI, EVERYONE!
HI

04:16.056 --> 04:18.224
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
I WAS THE EQUIPMENT MANAGER FIVE

04:18.224 --> 04:22.062
MINUTES AGO.
THEN SOMEONE JUST PUSHED ME ON
STAGE AND WHISPERED, YOU THE

04:22.062 --> 04:29.469
COACH NOW!
SO LET ME SAY THIS
LAS VEGAS WILL NOT TOLERATE

04:29.469 --> 04:34.974
MISOGYNY OF ANY KIND
NEVER HAS, NEVER WILL.
I WILL VOUCH FOR THE ENTIRE CITY

04:34.974 --> 04:42.515
ON THAT.
ALSO, I'M RESIGNING IMMEDIATELY.
I SEE REPORTERS DIGGING THROUGH

04:42.515 --> 04:47.354
MY OLD TWEETS, AND THIS WILL NOT
END WELL FOR ME.
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE DRESSED UP

04:47.354 --> 04:55.495
AS JACKIE CHAN FOR HALLOWEEN
BUT 2019 WAS A DIFFERENT ERA
THANK YOU, AND I'LL THROW IT

04:55.495 --> 05:03.169
OVER TO THE NEW CHAIRMAN OF
WOMEN'S RELATIONS FOR THE NFL,
A CHEERLEADER FOR THE WASHINGTON

05:03.169 --> 05:12.679
FOOTBALL TEAM.
THANK YOU
THANK YOU.

05:12.679 --> 05:17.050
I LIKE MY TEAM DON'T HAVE A
NAME
I WANT TO SAY, THE E-MAILS JON

05:17.050 --> 05:22.322
GRUDEN SENT TO OUR ORGANIZATION
DO NOT REFLECT THE VALUES OF OUR
TEAM, A TEAM THAT UNTIL A YEAR

05:22.322 --> 05:32.632
AGO WAS CALLED THE REDSKINS.
I ALSO WANT TO THANK TO WOMEN
WHO FELT OFFEND BY THE E-MAILS

05:32.632 --> 05:36.670
LIGHTEN UP
THEY'RE FUNNY.
IT WAS A NAME OF THE FIRST

05:36.670 --> 05:41.241
FEMALE REFEREE AND SHE WAS
THINKING, WAIT A MINUTE, THIS
ISN'T MY KITCHEN

05:41.241 --> 05:51.484
THAT'S FUNNY
JUST RELAX
NOW TO SOOTHE EVERYTHING OVER

05:51.484 --> 05:55.855
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE OUR
MASCOT
WE'VE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS

05:55.855 --> 06:02.495
CHLG WE'RE USING WHITE
STEREOTYPES.
PLEASE WELCOME GIUSEPPE, THE

06:02.495 --> 06:07.534
STIPGY ITALIAN

06:07.534 --> 06:17.277
ABOUT.
ITALIANS MAKING THE MEET BALLS
AND DOING A PIZZA.

06:17.277 --> 06:20.580
I SO SORRY, I CANNOT DO THIS
THIS DON'T FEEL RIGHT.
SPEAKING OF NOT RIGHT, HI,

06:20.580 --> 06:30.590
I'M COLIN KAEPERNICK
REMEMBER ME?
SO MUCH STUFF COMING OUT ABOUT

06:30.590 --> 06:36.162
THE NFL MAYBE RACIST, KIND OF.
HUH.
I WONDER IF ANYBODY TRIED TO

06:36.162 --> 06:41.468
WARN PEOPLE ABOUT THIS BEFORE.
I'M SCRATCHING MY HEAD TRYING TO
REMEMBER WHO SAID THAT

06:41.468 --> 06:45.772
SCRATCH, SCRATCH
IT'S ALMOST LIKE THAT'S THE
REASON THEY BANNED ME FROM THE

06:45.772 --> 06:49.909
LEAGUE
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE IT WAS JUST YOUR WEIRD

06:49.909 --> 06:56.449
HAIR CUT
BUT GOOD NEWS.
I THINK WE MAY HAVE FOUND A

06:56.449 --> 07:00.053
SOLUTION THAT MAKES EVERYONE
HAPPY.
SOMEONE EVEN TWITTER CAN GET

07:00.053 --> 07:09.863
BEHIND
INTRODUCING OUR NEW HEAD COACH,
LAVAR BURTON

07:09.863 --> 07:16.369
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
SUCK IT, MAYIM BIALIK.
I AM THE SUPREME FOOTBALL HOST

07:16.369 --> 07:22.909
NOW.
I WILL TAKE OFFENSE FOR 300.
WHAT IS A HANDOFF?

07:22.909 --> 07:28.281
I'M GENUINELY ASKING
I'M A THEATER KID, COME ON

07:28.281 --> 07:33.153

GOING TO BE JUST FINE.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE

10:22.555 --> 10:29.596
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK
YOU, EVERYONE.
I AM SO EXCITED TO BE HERE

10:29.596 --> 10:33.400
MY NAME IS RAMI MALEK AND I'M
HONORED TO BE STANDING ON THIS
STAGE.

10:33.400 --> 10:38.204
YOU KNOW, I PLAYED A LOT OF
DRAMATIC ROLES IN MY CAREER.
MOST RECENTLY THE NEW BOND

10:38.204 --> 10:46.279
VILLAIN.
BUT I DON'T USUALLY DO COMEDY.
YEAH, I TEND TO PLAY THESE

10:46.279 --> 10:52.819
REALLY INTENSE CHARACTERS, WHICH
MAKES A LOT OF SENSE, BECAUSE
PEOPLE TELL ME I HAVE WHAT'S

10:52.819 --> 10:59.859
CALLED "ARRESTING VILLAIN FACE."
LIKE THIS IS ME TOTALLY NEUTRAL.
AND I KNOW MOST PEOPLE WOULD

10:59.859 --> 11:05.231
RATHER PLAY THE HERO
BUT WEIRDLY, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
MORE DRAWN TO VILLAINS

11:05.231 --> 11:09.502
I SYMPATHIZE WITH THEM, YOU
KNOW
IN "LION KING.

11:09.502 --> 11:15.408
I'M TEAM SCAR.
I ACTUALLY FOUND SIMBA TO BE
KIND OF ANNOYING

11:15.408 --> 11:24.084
YOU WANT TO BE KING?
YOU'RE LIKE 3 YEARS OLD.
RELAX!

11:24.084 --> 11:29.456
AND IN "SILENCE OF THE LAMBS."
I'M ALWAYS LIKE, THAT POOR
HANNIBAL

11:29.456 --> 11:33.226
THAT LADY JUST KEEPS COMING IN
AND ASKING HIM ALL THESE
QUESTIONS.

11:33.226 --> 11:38.631
IT'S LIKE, LEAVE THE GUY ALONE,
CLARICE!
I THINK A LOT OF VILLAINS ARE

11:38.631 --> 11:45.605
JUST MISUNDERSTOOD
FOR EXAMPLE, JAWS, HUNGRY.
DRACULA, THIRSTY

11:45.605 --> 11:51.511
FRANKENSTEIN, HORNY.
I CAN KEEP GOING
DARTH VADER, IS JUST TRYING TO

11:51.511 --> 12:01.721
RECONNECT WITH HIS SON
FREDDIE KRUGER, ENCOURAGING KIDS
TO DREAM

12:01.721 --> 12:07.694
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S NICE TO SEE VILLAINS
FINALLY GETTING SOME RESPECT

12:07.694 --> 12:10.930
DISNEY'S EVEN MADE MOVIES WHERE
THE VILLAIN'S NAME'S ARE IN THE
TITLE.

12:10.930 --> 12:16.903
"CRUELLA."
"MALEFICENT.
"BAMBI."

12:16.903 --> 12:26.546
BUT HONESTLY, I'M HAPPY TO PLAY
THE VILLAIN.
I'M SO HAPPY TO BE IN MOVIES

12:26.546 --> 12:28.615
I NEVER THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE MY
LIFE
I'M THE SON OF EGYPTIAN

12:28.615 --> 12:30.784
IMMIGRANTS
AND I HAD KIND OF A SHELTERED
CHILDHOOD.

12:30.784 --> 12:34.087
IT WAS SO SHELTERED, I GREW UP
IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY IN
L.A., BUT SOMEHOW I HAD NO IDEA

12:34.087 --> 12:38.291
THAT I LIVED RIGHT NEXT TO
HOLLYWOOD.
SERIOUSLY, AS A KID.

12:38.291 --> 12:45.365
I DREAMED OF GOING TO THE WALK
OF FAME, THE SUNSET STRIP.
I TRULY THOUGHT IT WAS A MILLION

12:45.365 --> 12:49.703
MILES AWAY
IT WAS A 10-MINUTE DRIVE
WELL, IT'S THREE HOURS WITH

12:49.703 --> 12:56.676
TRAFFIC.
BUT IT WAS GREAT
I LOVED GROWING UP THERE WITH MY

12:56.676 --> 13:01.581
FAMILY, MY MOM, MY DAD, MY
SISTER, AND MY TWIN BROTHER.
YES.

13:01.581 --> 13:09.956
YES, I GOT A TWIN BROTHER.
AND YES, HE WILL BE SWAPPING
PLACES WITH ME IN ONE SKETCH

13:09.956 --> 13:16.262
TONIGHT.
AND YOU'LL NEVER KNOW WHICH ONE.
IT MIGHT EVEN BE RIGHT NOW

13:16.262 --> 13:19.532
NO, I'M KIDDING.
IT'S ME.
RAMI

13:19.532 --> 13:25.472
OR IS IT
NO, NO, IT IS.
BUT REALLY, THIS IS SUCH A

13:25.472 --> 13:29.776
SPECIAL NIGHT FOR ME
BOTH OF MY SIBLINGS ARE HERE
AND I'M SO PROUD OF THEM

13:29.776 --> 13:37.884
MY BROTHER'S A TEACHER, MY
SISTER'S AN E.R. DOCTOR.
THEY ARE TRULY INCREDIBLE

13:37.884 --> 13:42.789
PEOPLE
AND THEY HAVE DEVOTED THEIR
LIVES TO HELPING OTHERS.

13:42.789 --> 13:45.091
BUT I HAVE AN OSCAR, SO.
KIND OF EVEN
WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU

13:45.091 --> 13:48.795

LIKE BURNING MAN FOR WEIRD KIDS.
SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, BUGS.
I'M A PRAYING MANTIS, BUT NOT

14:31.371 --> 14:32.872
RELIGIOUS.
I PREY ON PESTS IN THE GARDEN.

I CAN HAVE UP TO 20 SPOTS, AND
THAT'S A LOT
I'M A STINKBUG.

LOOKING FORWARD TO LEARNING A
BIT MORE
LET'S HEAR ABOUT YOUR DIETS

15:05.872 --> 15:09.109
WELL, I EAT WEEDS AND
GRASSES, BUT NOT THE KIND YOU'RE
THINKING

15:09.109 --> 15:11.845
DON'T GET ME IN TROUBLE.
I EAT BUGS, AND IN MY LIFE I
CAN EAT UP TO 5,000.

15:11.845 --> 15:17.217
AND THAT'S A LOT
AND WHAT DOES DADDY LONG LEGS
EAT?

15:17.217 --> 15:37.203
BOYS, BOYS, BOYS
OKAY.

15:37.203 --> 15:43.777
CALL ME DADDY
OKAY.

15:43.777 --> 15:46.446
I APPRECIATE THE CREATIVITY, BUT
I'D LOVE TO KNOW SOME MORE ABOUT
YOUR INSECT.

15:46.446 --> 15:56.556
IT'S ALL IN THE NAME.
I'M A FATHER, AND MY LEGS GO ALL
ON FOR WEEKS

15:56.556 --> 16:01.761
OK.
AND DADDY.

16:01.761 --> 16:03.797
I DON'T WANT THAT FROM YOU.
OKAY, RUSSELL
CAN YOU SAY ANY SCIENCE FACTS

16:03.797 --> 16:05.498
ABOUT YOURSELF
SURE.
I'M HOT, I PARTY, I WALK INTO

16:05.498 --> 16:19.446
THE ROOM, AND I AM RESPECTED
NO MORE QUESTIONS!
RUSSELL, YOU LOOKED LIKE YOU

16:19.446 --> 16:23.750
WERE ABOUT TO DO A DEATH DROP,
BUT THEN YOU STOPPED
I GOT SCARED.

16:23.750 --> 16:27.554
I'VE ONLY DONE IT ONCE, AND I
DIDN'T WANT TO SPLIT MY ASS OPEN
IN FRONT OF THE JUDGES

16:27.554 --> 16:32.392
THERE ARE NO JUDGES
YEAH, WHAT IS THIS KID'S
DEAL

16:32.392 --> 16:39.766
HIS DAD IS AN EXEC AT BRAVO,
HIS OTHER DAD IS A REPUBLICAN.
HONESTLY, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

16:39.766 --> 16:42.635
I'VE EVER HEARD HIM SPEAK.
OH, GOT IT.
I GOT TO SAY THIS FEELS KIND

16:42.635 --> 16:46.873
OF UNFAIR.
HE'S NAMED AFTER HIS LEGS AND
I'M NAMED AFTER STINK.

16:46.873 --> 16:53.513
HONESTLY, JOHNNY, OUT OF ALL
THE SEVENTH GRADE BOYS, YOU
SMELL REALLY GOOD.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.082
THANKS, KEV
ALSO, I COULD HAVE SWORN
RUSSELL WAS ASSIGNED A

16:56.082 --> 17:03.423
COCKROACH.
IT WASN'T A FIT
GUYS, LET'S STAY ON TRACK

17:03.423 --> 17:07.394
DO YOU BUGS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
FOR EACH OTHER
I DO.

17:07.394 --> 17:19.773
HOW DOES THE DADDY LONG LEGS
TRACK ITS PREY.
I SLAM DOWN BY CREDIT CARD ON

17:19.773 --> 17:21.274
GROUND AND SAY, "DADDY'S GOT
IT."
WHY ISN'T THERE A MOMMY LONG

17:21.274 --> 17:22.809

OF HERE NOW!

17:22.809 --> 17:29.049
I'M GOING TO FREAK OUT
OKAY, OKAY, DAISY, TAKE A
TIME OUT

17:29.049 --> 17:33.153
I'LL HAVE TO SHOWER LATER,
BITCH.
WHO IS HE POINTING TO

17:33.153 --> 17:34.554
I DON'T KNOW.
IS HE PLAYING CHARADES
OKAY, YOU.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.256
DADDY LONG LEGS.
I GOT IT
ALL RIGHT, WELL, ONE OF THE COOL

17:36.256 --> 17:38.324
THINGS ABOUT TODAY IS THAT WE
CAN SEE HOW DIFFERENT BUGS
INTERACT

17:38.324 --> 17:40.193
SINCE YOU'RE SUCH AN ARTISTIC
BUNCH, LET'S SEE HOW DADDY LONG
LEGS AND STINK BUGS MIGHT EXIST

17:40.193 --> 17:45.432
IN NATURE.
AND GO
HI, MR. LONG LEGS, I'M A

17:45.432 --> 17:50.837
STINKBUG
IT'S BEEN AWHILE.
YOU LOOK WORSE

17:50.837 --> 17:54.607
WHO LET YOU IN
WHAT?
OH, STINKBUG, I'VE MISSED

17:54.607 --> 18:02.115
YOU.
I WANT YOUR STINK BACK IN MY
LIFE

18:02.115 --> 18:06.686
LET'S GET REMARRIED.
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH
I GUESS WE LET THAT GO ON FOR A

18:06.686 --> 18:09.422
LITTLE BIT OF A WHILE.
I KIND OF GOT LOST IN IT
THE TEAMWORK WAS PRETTY DAMN

18:09.422 --> 18:18.798
GOOD
YOU KNOW, RUSSELL ISN'T THE
ONLY ONE HERE WHO CAN DO COOL

18:18.798 --> 18:22.168
STUFF.

I DIDN'T EXPECT THIS DECISION TO
BE SO DIFFICULT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, JORDAN PEELE?

22:27.547 --> 22:29.182
I STILL CAN'T DECIDE, BUT
IT'S DEFINITELY BETWEEN THE LAST

PRINCE IN MY NEW BIO

22:59.412 --> 23:02.816
WE CAN ONLY PICK ONE.
OF COURSE
RIGHT, RIGHT.

23:02.816 --> 23:12.726
THE ONLY WAY TO DO THIS IS TO
HAVE A PRINCIPLES-OFF.
WHAT IS A PRINCE AFTER OFF?

23:12.726 --> 23:14.461
YES, I'LL CALL OUT SOME
RANDOM SCENES FROM THE SCRIPT.
AND YOU TWO WILL GIVE ME YOUR

23:14.461 --> 23:15.962

25:18.651 --> 25:20.754

25:20.754 --> 25:22.355

UH-HUH.
DID YOU EVEN READ THE SCRIPT?
YEAH, I THOUGHT IT WAS A

25:57.090 --> 26:05.632
HORROR MOVIE THAT WAS ABOUT
RACISM
I'M HERE NOW, CAN I AT LEAST

34:56.896 --> 35:00.700
DO YOU WAN' KNOW HOW IT IS *
* WHEN YOU A BIG DAWG
YOU MIGHT GOT TO

35:00.700 --> 35:14.047
YOU MIGHT GOT TO
TAKE THE ASSIS
LET YOUR DAWG GET *

35:47.213 --> 35:57.957
COLIN JOST AND MICHAEL CHE
THANK YOU
GOOD EVENING

35:57.957 --> 36:01.194
WELCOME TO "WEEKEND UPDATE,"
I'M MICHAEL CHE.
I'M COLIN JOST.

36:01.194 --> 36:05.565
THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S
CLIMATE PLAN IS LIKELY TO BE
DROPPED FROM THE BUDGET BILL

36:05.565 --> 36:10.403
AFTER SENATOR JOE MANCHIN
REFUSED TO SUPPORT IT.
I'M NOT GOING TO LET SOME BAD

36:10.403 --> 36:17.444
CLIMATE NEWS RUIN THIS BEAUTIFUL
80 DEGREE OCTOBER DAY.
MANCHIN, WHO'S FROM WEST

36:17.444 --> 36:20.780
VIRGINIA, SAID HE WOULD ONLY
AGREE TO BIDEN'S BILL IF IT CUTS
CLEAN ENERGY AND OFFICIALLY

36:20.780 --> 36:28.221
MAKES COAL ONE OF THE FIVE FOOD
GROUPS
A NEW REPORT SHOWS THAT

36:28.221 --> 36:32.058
PRESIDENT BIDEN IS ON AVERAGE
22 MINUTES LATE FOR PUBLIC
EVENTS

36:32.058 --> 36:39.132
WORSE, HE ONLY DOES IT TO APPEAL
TO BLACK VOTERS.
THE BROOKLYN NETS HAVE

36:39.132 --> 36:43.470
BENCHED STAR PLAYER KYRIE IRVING
FROM THE TEAM UNTIL HE'S FINALLY
VACCINATED

36:43.470 --> 36:55.515
AND AS A NEW YORK SPORTS FAN I
HOPE THIS DECISION FINALLY
FORCES KYRIE TO DO THE RIGHT

36:55.515 --> 37:01.454
THING AND BUY A FAKE VACCINATION
CARD
LOGISTICAL DELAYS CAUSED BY

37:01.454 --> 37:03.223
WORKER SHORTAGES AND COVID
OUTBREAKS HAVE DOUBLED THE TIME
IT TAKES FOR SOME PRODUCTS TO

37:03.223 --> 37:10.797
GET FROM ASIA TO THE U.S
THIS MIGHT SOUND CRAZY, BUT
COULD WE USE BATS?

37:10.797 --> 37:15.168
'CAUSE THE LAST TIME THEY PUT
SOMETHING IN BATS, IT GOT
EVERYWHERE REAL QUICK.

37:15.168 --> 37:18.938
OH, YOU'RE PRO-BAT HERE?
OKAY
TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY

37:18.938 --> 37:22.175
PETE BUTTIGIEG IS BEING
CRITICIZED FOR REMAINING ON
PATERNITY LEAVE WITH HIS HUSBAND

37:22.175 --> 37:27.047
AND CHILD WHILE SUPPLY CHAIN
PROBLEMS THREATEN THE HOLIDAY
SHOPPING SEASON.

37:27.047 --> 37:41.594
SAID CONSERVATIVES, SEE, YOU LET
GAY COUPLES HAVE KIDS AND GOD
CANCELS CHRISTMAS.

37:41.594 --> 37:44.864
A NEW STUDY SHOWS THAT
CORONAVIRUS CAN CAUSE
INFERTILITY IN MEN

37:44.864 --> 37:46.966
SO IT'S NOT ALL BAD.
I DON'T KNOW WHY IT CUTS TO
ME ON THAT

37:46.966 --> 38:04.150
I DON'T KNOW WHY IT CUTS TO
ME ON THAT
BUT, OKAY.

38:08.688 --> 38:15.161
DOES ANYONE WANT TO BE JUDGED BY
THEIR OLD E-MAILS?
IF YOU COULD SEE HALF THE

38:15.161 --> 38:21.468
E-MAILS CHE SENDS ME
ACTUALLY, I'LL SHOW YOU ONE.
THE SUBLINE IS LISTEN UP, HONKY.

38:21.468 --> 38:29.142
THEN THE BODY OF THE E-MAIL JUST
SAYS I WISH THEY GOT YOU INSTEAD
OF HARAMBO

38:29.142 --> 38:35.281
SO YOU DID GET THAT ONE
COLIN KAEPERNICK REVEALED
THAT HE HAS MAINTAINED HIS

38:35.281 --> 38:36.850
5:00 A.M. TRAINING REGIMEN IN
CASE HE GETS CALLED BACK UP TO
THE NFL.

38:36.850 --> 38:40.086
BUT THE GIANTS ARE STILL GOING
TO STICK WITH THEIR CURRENT
QUARTERBACK, A SCARECROW ON A

38:40.086 --> 38:46.059
ROOMBA
A PHOTO OF TIMOTHEE CHALAMET
A PHOTO OF TIMOTHEE CHALAMET

38:46.059 --> 38:53.566
AS WILLY WONKA IN AN UPCOMING
PREQUEL TO "CHARLIE AND THE
CHOCOLATE FACTORY" WENT VIRAL

38:53.566 --> 38:59.506

MEDIA CALLING HIM A TWINK WILLY

I CAME HERE TO MAKE A STATEMENT
ON OUR IMPENDING FACTORY STRIKE.
BUT NOW I GUESS I GOT TO CALL MY

39:35.208 --> 39:39.512
PARENTS.
WHEN DOES THIS AIR
OH, IT'S LIVE

39:39.512 --> 39:45.418

39:45.418 --> 39:49.823
I SHOULD PROBABLY READ MY THING,

WELL, WITH ALL THE RECENT

39:49.823 --> 39:53.593
COVERAGE OF AN ATTRACTIVE YOUNG
WONKA IS SCRUMP-DIDDLY-UMPTIOUS,

39:53.593 --> 40:04.004
SCRUMP-DIDDLY-UMPTIOUS ARE THE
UNSAFE WORKING COMPANIES THAT

40:04.004 --> 40:06.072
ARE YOU OKAY?
SORRY, I'M JUST THINKING
ABOUT HOW MY PARENTS SAW THAT MY

40:06.072 --> 40:07.707
PHONE BACKGROUND AS PICTURE OF
LAURA DERN, AND I LET THEM THINK
SHE'S MY WIFE.

40:07.707 --> 40:13.613
THEY'RE NOT NEGATIVE
THEY LIVE IN LOOMPA LAND, THEY
JUST GOT "WILL & GRACE."

40:13.613 --> 40:24.224
IT'S GOING TO BE A CONVERSATION.
WE CAN STOP IF YOU WANT
NO, IT'S FINE

40:24.224 --> 40:30.430
THIS TWING WONKA OR TWONKA, MA
LOOK AS YUMMY AS LICKABLE
WALLPAPER.

40:30.430 --> 40:36.970
BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE, HE IS
NOTHING MORE THAN --
ACTUALLY, I'M GOING TO GO OFF

40:36.970 --> 40:38.605
SCRIPT BECAUSE A CLOSETED PERSON
WROTE THIS
POINT BLANK, THE MAN DON'T KNOW

40:38.605 --> 40:40.273
HOW TO MAKE CHOCOLATE, OKAY?
HE'S A VISIONARY WHO'S NEVER
TOUCHED A MACHINE, HE JUST

40:40.273 --> 40:46.680
TUMBLES INTO THE INVENTING ROOM
AND SAYS SOMETHING LIKE, "WHAT
ABOUT A SODA THAT MAKES YOU

40:46.680 --> 40:55.355
FLY?
MEANWHILE WE'RE UP ALL NIGHT
REHEARSING THE LITTLE SONG AND

40:55.355 --> 41:10.437
DANCE WE DO WHEN A CHILD DIES.
THE WHOLE THING IS SICK.
MAN

41:10.437 --> 41:13.073
WELL, I GUESS YOU'RE NOT EXCITED
ABOUT THIS NEW WONKA
I'M SORRY, DO I JUST -- GIVE

41:13.073 --> 41:14.708
OFF A GAY VIBE OR SOMETHING?

41:14.708 --> 41:16.309
I MEAN, THERE'S A LOT OF
PRODUCT IN YOUR HAIR
OKAY.

41:16.309 --> 41:20.647
AND YOU JUST STEPPED OUT OF THE
SHOWER LIKE THAT WITH YOURS?

41:20.647 --> 41:31.558
OKAY, WOW, I'M BEING A BITCH.
HONKSLY, IT DOES FEEL NICE TO BE

41:31.558 --> 41:35.795
NOW THAT I'M OUT OF THE CLOSET,
MAYBE YOU CAN COME OUT, TOO,
COLIN.

41:35.795 --> 41:37.997
OH, NO, I'M NOT GAY.
SORRY, GIRLS, I TRIED
A PROUD GAY OOMPA LOOMPA,

41:37.997 --> 41:47.140
EVERYONE
EXPERTS SAY THAT BY 2026,
EXPERTS SAY THAT BY 2026,

41:47.140 --> 41:51.411
DISNEY PLUS WILL SURPASS NETFLIX
TO BECOME THE TOP STREAMING
PLATFORM IN THE WORLD.

41:51.411 --> 42:02.722
"NOT SO FAST," SAID PORN HUB
DC COMICS ANNOUNCED THE NEW
SUPERMAN WILL BE BISEXUAL.

42:02.722 --> 42:09.763
THEY ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT THE
RIDDLER HAS ALWAYS BEEN DOWN FOR
WHATEVER

42:09.763 --> 42:17.837
A CALIFORNIA RANCH, ONCE
OWNED BY RONALD REAGAN, IS BEING
THREATENED BY A LARGE WILDFIRE

42:17.837 --> 42:20.573
CREWS ARE HOPING TO PUT OUT THE
BLAZE BY POURING WATER ONTO A
NEARBY HILL AND HOPING IT

42:20.573 --> 42:37.090
TRICKLES DOWN.
ECONOMICS
AN ECONOMIC JOKE

42:37.090 --> 42:38.758
MUSIC COMMENTATORS ARE
NOTING THAT UPCOMING RELEASES
FROM TAYLOR SWIFT AND ADELE

42:38.758 --> 42:40.260
SIGNAL A SHIFT IN THE INDUSTRY
FROM HOT GIRL SUMMER TO SAD GIRL
AUTUMN

42:40.260 --> 42:58.211
AUTUMN
WHICH IS FOLLOWED AS ALWAYS BY
MESSY DIVA CHRISTMAS

43:09.756 --> 43:19.466
THEY WILL NO LONGER PLAY THEIR
1971 RECORD "BROWN SUGAR."
SOMETHING I WISH I'D KNOWN

43:19.466 --> 43:35.448
1971 RECORD "BROWN SUGAR."
SOMETHING I WISH I'D KNOWN
SOMETHING I WISH I'D KNOWN

43:39.853 --> 43:43.089
UP HERE EVERY \SATURDAY KEEPING
US INFORMED IS IMPORTANT, BRO.
BUT CHE, WHEN DO YOU TAKE A

43:43.089 --> 43:49.662
MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT THE
IMPORTANT UNIMPORTANT THINGS,
BROTHER?

43:49.662 --> 43:56.302
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?
YOU KNOW, THE STUFF LIKE MOST
PEOPLE DON'T TALK ABOUT BECAUSE

43:56.302 --> 43:58.238
TECHNICALLY IT DON'T MATTER.
HERE
LET ME TAKE A MOMENT REAL QUICK.

43:58.238 --> 44:00.440
HIT ME
*
ALL THAT TALK ABOUT DEBT CEILING

44:00.440 --> 44:02.609
AND CLIMATE CHANGE, BUT NOBODY
TALKS ABOUT THE FACT THAT NOT A
SINGLE PERSON HERE KNOWS A

44:02.609 --> 44:04.244
PERSON THAT DRIVES OR OPERATES A
BLIMP.
A BLIMP

44:04.244 --> 44:09.082
YES, A BLIMP.
LIKE, WHY DO WE NOT KNOW WHO
DRIVES THAT?

44:09.082 --> 44:17.957
WHEN SOMEONE SAYS, I'M A DRIVER.
YOU DON'T SAY, OH, CAR OR BLIMP?
WHO'S DRIVING THESE THINGS

44:17.957 --> 44:23.930
THEY COULD FLY A PLANE OR A JET.
NO, I WANT TO FLY A SLOW-ASS
DILDO ACROSS THE SKY

44:23.930 --> 44:25.665
I KNOW MORE CRACKHEADS BY NAME
THAN I KNOW BLIMP DRIVERS.
THAT'S A REAL -- ACTUALLY, ALL

44:25.665 --> 44:32.772
ACROSS THE COUNTRY, NOT ONE
PERSON KNOWS A BLIMP DRIVER.
THIS MIGHT BE A DUMB QUESTION,

44:32.772 --> 44:36.843
BUT ARE WE SURE BLIMPS ARE REAL?
I'M PRETTY SURE THEY'RE REAL,
CHRIS.

44:36.843 --> 44:39.079
EXACTLY
PRETTY SURE.
I'VE NEVER HEARD A COMING OF AGE

44:39.079 --> 44:51.358
STORY ABOUT A BLIMP DRIVER
HOLD ON, CHRIS, THIS WASN'T
THE PLAN

44:51.358 --> 44:53.126
WHAT?
WEREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
TALKING ABOUT THE LAST TIME YOU

44:53.126 --> 44:54.594
WERE UP HERE
NO.
AND THAT THING YOU SAID

44:54.594 --> 44:56.863
I DON'T THINK SO, I THINK I
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE TALKING
ABOUT -- WHY IS EVERYBODY SO MAD

44:56.863 --> 44:59.499
ABOUT SUPERMAN'S SON IN THE
COMICS BEING A LITTLE BI-SEX BOY
NOW?

44:59.499 --> 45:04.404
WHAT A WASTE OF TIME THAT IS
HE'S NOT REAL.
AND I DON'T CARE WHAT REAL

45:04.404 --> 45:09.209
PEOPLE DO WITH THEIR SEX
SO WHY WOULD I CARE ABOUT A
STENCIL, DOG

45:09.209 --> 45:14.047
THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING FOR
EVERYBODY, SO TREAT LIFE LIKE A
PORN HUB SELECTION

45:14.047 --> 45:17.851
IF IT AIN'T FOR YOU, DON'T CLICK
THE TAB.
ANYWAY, WHAT PORN YOU WATCH,

45:17.851 --> 45:28.795
CHE?
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT PORN,
CHRIS.

45:28.795 --> 45:30.196
ME NEITHER, YOU RIGHT
MY PORN-WATCHING DAYS ARE OVER,
MAN.

45:30.196 --> 45:31.831
BECAUSE I THOUGHT AN AMOUNT OF
FEEDBACK, LIKE THE PASSION IN
YOUR EYES.

45:31.831 --> 45:38.538
ANYWAY, WILLIAM SHATNER WENT TO
HEY, COLIN, CAN I SMOKE IN YOUR
HOUSE?

45:38.538 --> 45:40.140
I HAVE A BABY
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN ON LITTLE

45:40.140 --> 45:45.945
BABY CLETUS.
YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT HIS NAME.
I'VE SENT YOU PICTURES

45:45.945 --> 45:54.087
I GET A LOT OF PICTURES,
COLIN.
I ONLY REMEMBER THE BOOBIES.

45:54.087 --> 45:55.622
CHRIS, CHRIS.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE LAST TIME

45:55.622 --> 45:57.157
YOU WERE HERE, MAN
DAMN, ALL RIGHT, MAN.
ROLL THE DAMN CLIP

45:57.157 --> 46:02.595

THIS IS LIKE HIGH SCHOOL, BUT

46:29.155 --> 46:33.059
YOU CAN HAVE SEX WITH YOUR
TEACHER.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

46:33.059 --> 46:42.068
I'M PRETTY SURE YOU ACTUALLY
CAN'T, MAN
OH.

46:42.068 --> 46:45.839
