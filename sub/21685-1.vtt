WEBVTT

01:58.352 --> 02:01.722
* You and me *

02:01.789 --> 02:04.492
* Me and you *

02:04.558 --> 02:10.864
* Somehow we make it through *

02:10.931 --> 02:13.467
* I may be gone *

02:13.534 --> 02:17.305
* I may be far away *

02:17.371 --> 02:20.608
* But I'll walk beside you *

02:20.674 --> 02:25.012
* Every step of the way *

02:25.078 --> 02:29.250
* When you're used bruised *

02:29.317 --> 02:31.852
* Black and blue *

02:31.919 --> 02:36.324
* Don't think about it *

02:36.390 --> 02:39.026
* Never doubt it *

02:39.092 --> 02:42.863
* I'll walk beside you **

02:47.100 --> 02:48.402
I just..

02:48.469 --> 02:49.770
I don't-I don't understand

02:49.837 --> 02:52.606
how you can still love me.

03:10.258 --> 03:13.227
Built for stamina, me.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.273
'Cormoran?'

03:28.309 --> 03:30.944
Uh, it's 9:40.

03:31.011 --> 03:32.313
- Ugh!
- The client's waiting.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.682
Thought you'd want to, uh..

03:34.748 --> 03:37.918
I'll be five minutes.
The alarm must've..

03:37.985 --> 03:40.220
Could you offer them
a cup of tea or something?

03:40.288 --> 03:42.323
Yeah, we're on second cups
already.

03:42.390 --> 03:44.157
'Okay, offer them a biscuit.'

03:44.224 --> 03:46.159
That always makes people
feel special.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.495
Right.

04:18.526 --> 04:21.295
Reading it again?

04:21.362 --> 04:22.663
So, Daniel, I'm off.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.264
Now, I've done a letter
for the HR people.

04:24.332 --> 04:25.899
Don't try to dissuade me.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.134
What's this about?

04:27.200 --> 04:29.537
No, no. Please don't.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.339
It's effective immediately.

04:31.405 --> 04:33.507
Et cetera, et cetera.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.057
Morning.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.792
Fifteen minutes late.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.794
I bet the army wouldn't
let you get away with that.

04:53.861 --> 04:55.228
If you didn't have
such a good-looking secretary

04:55.295 --> 04:56.464
I'd have left.

04:56.530 --> 04:57.798
Good morning.
How can I help you?

04:57.865 --> 05:00.868
Hey, excuse me.
I'm not waiting.

05:03.136 --> 05:06.707
Robin, would you make up
Mr. Baker's final bill?

05:06.774 --> 05:09.577
- But you're not finished.
- We are.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.044
I'm sure you can find somebody
who doesn't mind

05:11.111 --> 05:13.414
having a tosser for a client.

05:13.481 --> 05:14.682
Come this way.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.565
I need you to make
a phone call.

05:32.966 --> 05:34.201
One phone call?

05:34.267 --> 05:35.603
I can pay.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.004
Your girl said
what your rates are

05:37.070 --> 05:39.373
and if the call's not longer
than five minutes

05:39.440 --> 05:42.876
then I've already got
the money on me.

05:42.943 --> 05:44.912
My husband's gone off
to a writer's retreat

05:44.978 --> 05:46.580
and he'll have told 'em
not to pick up to me.

05:46.647 --> 05:48.782
So, I just need you
to get him on the line

05:48.849 --> 05:51.318
and then I can tell him
to come home.

05:51.385 --> 05:53.053
Could a friend not
do this for you?

05:53.120 --> 05:54.354
My neighbor, Edna, can't do it

05:54.422 --> 05:56.724
because she's a woman.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.526
He's gone off before,
only this time

05:58.592 --> 06:00.160
it's been ten days.

06:00.227 --> 06:02.963
And our girl's missin'
her daddy and gettin' upset

06:03.030 --> 06:04.898
and we need him back.

06:04.965 --> 06:08.101
Have you got the number
for this retreat?

06:08.168 --> 06:09.703
Bigley Hall.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.873
He's always talkin'
about that one.

06:19.547 --> 06:22.349
- Owen Quine.

06:22.416 --> 06:24.084
He's a very famous
and good novelist.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.386
Morning.
I'm calling for Owen Quine.

06:26.454 --> 06:29.623
I know Mr. Quine sometimes asks
for his calls to be screened

06:29.690 --> 06:31.659
but these, uh,
medical test results, uh..

06:31.725 --> 06:33.927
He really needs
to take this one.

06:35.496 --> 06:37.164
Okay.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.600
Thanks.

06:39.667 --> 06:42.903
He's not there.
I believe them.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.271
There's no charge.

06:44.337 --> 06:46.674
Sorry we couldn't help you.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.942
'I'll see you out.'

06:50.077 --> 06:51.712
'No charge.'

07:02.656 --> 07:03.957
How's the day looking?

07:04.024 --> 07:06.527
Oh, well, surveillance
on the Gunfrey place

07:06.594 --> 07:09.029
then I'm pulling town hall
records on Mr. Oaks

07:09.096 --> 07:11.064
while you see
Mrs. Ingalls in Chelsea

07:11.131 --> 07:14.201
and then...at 4 o'clock,
you're due to follow

07:14.267 --> 07:17.705
Mr. Upington from work, which I
reckon will take about two hours

07:17.771 --> 07:20.674
which will lead us
to 6 o'clock and drinks.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.811
Drinks?

07:23.877 --> 07:26.079
With Matthew.
It's been pushed back twice.

07:26.146 --> 07:29.416
- Please tell me..
Great. Fine.

07:29.483 --> 07:30.651
Uh, could you text me

07:30.718 --> 07:32.152
Caroline Ingalls'
contact details?

07:32.219 --> 07:33.253
Sure.

07:33.320 --> 07:36.023
Can you find him?

07:36.089 --> 07:37.825
'I'm afraid we haven't
the capacity'

07:37.891 --> 07:39.860
to take on another client.

07:39.927 --> 07:42.229
If you're worried, you could
maybe try calling the police.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.599
Yeah, they can trace phones
and track bank card usage

07:45.666 --> 07:47.467
things we can't do
without breaking the law.

07:47.535 --> 07:49.169
Yeah, but I called
the police before

07:49.236 --> 07:51.038
and then he showed up
in a hotel with some girl

07:51.104 --> 07:55.275
and everyone got upset
how I'd wasted police time.

07:55.342 --> 07:57.511
I got a photo of him.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.849
'His agent, Liz, will pay.'

08:01.915 --> 08:04.217
Owen's her best client.
She loves him.

08:04.284 --> 08:06.787
She can take it out
of his next commission.

08:09.389 --> 08:11.158
Please.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.028
Absolutely not.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.931
Leonora can find
her own damn husband.

08:20.300 --> 08:23.170
Excuse me, um..

08:23.236 --> 08:25.172
...end of flu.

08:25.238 --> 08:26.707
It's been hellish.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.911
And anyway, I fired Owen.

08:30.978 --> 08:33.914
I'm not sure
Leonora is aware of that.

08:33.981 --> 08:36.717
Was there any particular reason
for it?

08:36.784 --> 08:39.753
Owen has written a very
thinly disguised slandering

08:39.820 --> 08:41.521
of the people who've
tried to help him.

08:41.589 --> 08:43.657
He attacks his publisher

08:43.724 --> 08:46.226
his editor, me, other writers..

08:46.293 --> 08:49.296
It is a thinly disguised..

08:49.362 --> 08:50.831
...nasty little allegory

08:50.898 --> 08:53.100
that deserves nothing
but burning.

08:56.403 --> 09:00.574
And I say that as someone
who...loves books.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.446
Ralph!

09:06.513 --> 09:08.315
'He's out with Bo!'

09:08.381 --> 09:09.449
Mm.

09:09.516 --> 09:10.784
Owen would like nothing better

09:10.851 --> 09:11.919
than for a search party

09:11.985 --> 09:13.486
to be sent out to find him.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.690
I shan't pay for his PR.
Now, if you'll excuse me..

09:16.757 --> 09:18.325
That's him there, isn't it?

09:21.094 --> 09:23.196
Oh, yeah.

09:23.263 --> 09:25.532
That's, um..

09:25.599 --> 09:27.267
...me, Quine

09:27.334 --> 09:29.603
Andrew Fancourt..

09:29.670 --> 09:32.372
...Joe North.

09:32.439 --> 09:34.341
'My first three clients.'

09:34.407 --> 09:35.976
You represent Andrew Fancourt?

09:36.043 --> 09:37.945
He sells a lot of books,
doesn't he?

09:38.011 --> 09:39.112
Hm.

09:39.179 --> 09:40.513
Out of the three writers

09:40.580 --> 09:42.582
Andrew and I have parted ways.

09:42.650 --> 09:45.786
And...Joe's dead.

09:47.621 --> 09:49.089
AIDS.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.695
Do you think Quine
might be staying with friends?

09:54.762 --> 09:57.564
He hasn't got any left.

09:57.631 --> 10:00.100
Well, he teaches
creative writing

10:00.167 --> 10:03.937
that supplies him.
What a phrase that is.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.839
It supplies him
with a fresh pool

10:05.906 --> 10:08.075
of wide-eyed sycophants.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.681
'Oh.'

10:13.747 --> 10:16.083
- 'I'm not sure he's very well.'
- 'I know.'

10:16.149 --> 10:18.652
'His poos are like boulders.'

10:20.788 --> 10:22.923
Get him some fiber.

10:24.692 --> 10:28.696
And, um...a mint tea.

10:31.498 --> 10:33.300
For his bowel?

10:34.802 --> 10:36.737
For my throat.

10:36.804 --> 10:40.207
For God's sake, for the dog.

10:40.273 --> 10:42.943
Apparently, he took first
in English at Warwick.

10:43.010 --> 10:46.079
I'm minded to call them
to check.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.715
I won't waste any more
of your time.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.016
Just a few more questions.

10:49.082 --> 10:52.319
When was the last time
you saw Quine?

10:52.385 --> 10:56.323
We had lunch together.
We ate at Congreve's.

10:56.389 --> 11:00.227
By then, I'd had some very angry
calls from Daniel Chard.

11:00.293 --> 11:01.895
I have never not read
a manuscript

11:01.962 --> 11:03.230
before sending it off.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.766
But just for once,
I skimmed a few pages

11:05.833 --> 11:08.601
and told Ralph to send it off.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.203
Unforgivable.

11:12.072 --> 11:14.341
I went to stay
with a writer friend of mine

11:14.407 --> 11:16.676
Dorcus Pengelly.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.478
That's her real name.

11:18.545 --> 11:22.149
Once I had read what the book
contained, I..

11:22.215 --> 11:24.184
...fired him.

11:24.251 --> 11:26.286
- Mm.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.824
How did he take the news?

11:32.659 --> 11:34.895
Poorly.

11:34.962 --> 11:37.931
Before you judge me for that..

11:37.998 --> 11:39.266
...I'll have you know
that I was one

11:39.332 --> 11:41.902
of the very few friends
he had in this industry.

11:47.607 --> 11:48.675
No, not yet.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.744
She's sweet.

11:50.811 --> 11:53.046
Had a hard start in life.

11:53.113 --> 11:56.649
The state is niggardly
with those..

11:56.716 --> 11:58.852
...needing more help
than average.

12:00.187 --> 12:03.023
Perhaps you've discovered that
for yourself.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.933
I hope you feel better soon.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.304
'It will tell my story,
as all my books have done.'

12:17.370 --> 12:20.040
I drew upon my..

12:20.107 --> 12:23.777
...disagreement
with Andrew Fancourt.

12:24.644 --> 12:28.281
The end of a literary era.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.888
I'm putting together
a pack on Quine for you.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.890
He's a very important writer

12:36.957 --> 12:38.758
according to himself.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.628
'Those any good?'

12:41.694 --> 12:45.198
Eh...he's not a fan
of short sentences.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.835
I managed about ten pages
and had to take a break

12:47.901 --> 12:50.237
before I gave myself a migraine.

12:51.805 --> 12:54.574
Should I contact Liz Tassel
about billing?

12:54.641 --> 12:56.209
No, she won't be paying.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.878
'I would like to help his wife'

12:57.945 --> 13:00.413
but it will mean
turning down some paid work.

13:01.548 --> 13:02.883
Well, it's your business.

13:02.950 --> 13:06.053
When we're out of debt..

13:06.119 --> 13:10.290
I know you're worth more
than I'm currently paying you.

13:14.161 --> 13:17.030
It'll be a nice change trying
to bring a couple back together

13:17.097 --> 13:18.765
instead of helping people
divorce.

13:18.832 --> 13:21.902
Yeah, I thought that too.

13:21.969 --> 13:25.105
Alright, I'm off
to Islington now.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.340
Surveillance
on the Gunfrey place.

13:27.407 --> 13:30.110
'I'll swing
by Leonora Quine's first.'

13:30.177 --> 13:32.479
'Can you make a start
on those searches?'

13:32.545 --> 13:34.381
Will do.

13:34.447 --> 13:36.683
Don't forget drinks.

13:36.749 --> 13:38.518
I won't. See you at 8:00.

13:38.585 --> 13:41.121
6:00! We're meeting at 6:00!

13:41.188 --> 13:44.024
'6:00?'

14:05.678 --> 14:08.848
Uh, L-Leonora, dear,
I, I really must be..

14:15.923 --> 14:18.291
Cormoran Strike,
Private Investigator.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.427
God, has it come
to that already?

14:20.493 --> 14:22.695
Jerry's Owen's editor.

14:22.762 --> 14:24.898
He's one of the good ones.

14:26.433 --> 14:29.436
Of course, we all
do worry about him.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.471
Hm.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.873
You ring me as soon
as he shows up, alright?

14:34.874 --> 14:36.343
'Nice to meet you.'

14:48.788 --> 14:50.958
Did you smell the wine on him?

14:51.024 --> 14:53.893
I got woozy just talkin' to him.

14:53.961 --> 14:55.528
Nice he popped around though.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.160
Andrew.

15:27.227 --> 15:29.529
Have you read it?
Did he send it to you?

15:31.631 --> 15:33.300
What do you want?

15:34.834 --> 15:37.570
I fired Owen.

15:37.637 --> 15:40.040
As soon as I read "Bombyx,"
I told him it was despicable.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.541
I wanted you to know that.

15:41.608 --> 15:42.909
I haven't read it.

15:45.878 --> 15:48.115
Your dog is shitting
on my lavender.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.258
It's possible your husband
is seeking publicity

15:58.325 --> 16:01.161
for his new manuscript,
or he could be genuinely upset

16:01.228 --> 16:03.163
at being fired by his agent.

16:03.230 --> 16:06.099
He's her best client though.
He's really good.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.568
Liz came over to see him
last week and all.

16:08.635 --> 16:11.271
Back in the day, she chose him
over Andrew Fancourt.

16:11.338 --> 16:12.872
Why'd she go and fire him now?

16:12.939 --> 16:16.243
I think he insulted a lot
of the people she worked with.

16:18.245 --> 16:20.280
A hotel for ten days
would be expensive.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.515
Can you think of anyone
he might be staying with?

16:23.950 --> 16:26.419
He's had girlfriends
as well as flings.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.189
He always says, "That's that,
no more," every time

16:29.256 --> 16:30.757
and I always believe him.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.663
So, yeah, he's probably
shaggin' some girlfriend.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.767
And I still want him home.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.406
You're stinking my flat out!

18:13.893 --> 18:17.330
- Matthew.
- Hi. Cormoran.

18:17.397 --> 18:18.931
- Uh, no.

18:18.998 --> 18:20.767
It's table service here.

18:20.833 --> 18:21.934
In a pub?

18:23.403 --> 18:24.771
Matt comes here quite a lot.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.105
Yeah, the food's alright.

18:26.173 --> 18:28.040
Well, it's not Mango Tree,
but it passes.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.309
Mango Tree?

18:29.376 --> 18:30.877
Yeah, Thai place.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.212
Any good?

18:32.279 --> 18:33.846
'Yeah, if Thai's your thing.'

18:37.717 --> 18:39.252
Do you watch the rugby?

18:39.319 --> 18:40.887
No, what happened?

18:40.953 --> 18:42.722
England-Wales.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.325
- Okay.

18:45.392 --> 18:47.794
England, sixteen, Wales, five.

18:50.330 --> 18:53.633
Matt played rugby
for Yorkshire under 16s.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.268
- Ah..
- Yeah.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.670
Do you play anything? Um..

18:57.737 --> 18:59.839
Like, did you,
before you, you know.

18:59.906 --> 19:02.942
Oh, well, I-I used to be
the European hopscotch champion

19:03.009 --> 19:05.144
but I can't do that anymore.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.481
Funny.

19:12.552 --> 19:15.588
We'd like to invite you to..

19:24.831 --> 19:26.132
In eight weeks?

19:26.199 --> 19:27.834
- Mm-hm. Yup.
- Yeah.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.702
It's excitin'.

19:32.104 --> 19:34.241
So..

19:34.307 --> 19:36.643
...how long have you two
been together?

19:36.709 --> 19:38.845
- Nine years.
- Nine years. Yeah.

19:38.911 --> 19:40.613
Yeah, we went
to school together.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.716
Yeah, she was the only half-fit
girl with a brain, really.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.352
So I had no choice.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.222
What about you,
have you got a girlfriend?

19:49.289 --> 19:51.291
No. No.

19:52.392 --> 19:53.793
Not for a while.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.497
I might head to the bar, um..

19:57.564 --> 19:59.366
We're, um, we're working

19:59.432 --> 20:02.001
on a missing person's case.

20:02.068 --> 20:05.171
Sounds like most of the work's
watching married people cop off.

20:05.238 --> 20:08.308
I said to Robin, "You should be
called private investigators."

20:08.375 --> 20:09.842
That's not all we do.

20:09.909 --> 20:12.178
We're actually quite busy
at the moment, aren't we?

20:12.245 --> 20:15.214
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Gonna have
to take on a new investigator.

20:15.282 --> 20:16.749
'How do you find one?'

20:16.816 --> 20:19.552
Uh, we have the ties,
probably go with ex-police.

20:19.619 --> 20:21.954
They tend to have
useful relationships.

20:25.825 --> 20:28.728
I'm gonna go to the bar.
What can I get you?

20:28.795 --> 20:31.197
- Uh, yes, same again, please.
- Yeah.

20:31.264 --> 20:32.632
'Robin?'

20:34.334 --> 20:36.869
Oh, um, uh, white wine,
please, yeah.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.443
Alright.

20:43.510 --> 20:46.679
Um, white wine,
one of those Czech beers

20:46.746 --> 20:49.416
and, uh, can I get
a pint of that?

20:56.423 --> 20:59.258
I felt a bit sorry
for him, to be honest.

20:59.326 --> 21:01.794
He's not an easy
conversationalist, is he?

21:04.897 --> 21:06.566
What's up with you?

21:06.633 --> 21:09.469
Nothing, just, um..

21:09.536 --> 21:11.471
...him talkin' about
taking someone else on.

21:11.538 --> 21:13.373
Yeah, but not for your job.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.708
He just needs
another one of him.

21:15.775 --> 21:18.010
Yeah.

21:18.077 --> 21:20.747
I suppose I just thought
I'd move up the ladder there.

22:14.601 --> 22:17.036
I mean, I never bloody see you.

22:17.103 --> 22:18.738
You're bringing in
next to no money.

22:18.805 --> 22:20.740
Fuck's sake!

22:22.975 --> 22:26.245
I told you it'll be tough
at first, building up an agency.

22:26.312 --> 22:27.780
I'm pregnant.

22:40.593 --> 22:42.995
- Morning, Venetia.
- Morning.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.297
- How did you..
- 'It's on the invitation.'

22:45.364 --> 22:47.500
Oh. Mm.

22:47.567 --> 22:49.702
I was conceived in Venice.

22:51.237 --> 22:53.706
Good noodles at that pub.

22:53.773 --> 22:56.543
I think I've got something.

22:56.609 --> 22:58.645
You said he's only friends
with students

22:58.711 --> 23:00.613
so, I looked at the class
he teaches.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.114
They put out a publication
each year

23:02.181 --> 23:03.416
showcasing the students' work

23:03.483 --> 23:05.452
with contact details
and web links.

23:05.518 --> 23:07.587
One of them has a blog

23:07.654 --> 23:09.589
about her erotic fiction

23:09.656 --> 23:13.225
full of cozy mentions
of her and TGW

23:13.292 --> 23:15.662
The Great Writer.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.964
- Her name's Kathryn Kent.
- Sounds promising.

23:20.467 --> 23:22.902
What did you think of Matthew?

23:22.969 --> 23:24.471
Nice bloke.

23:53.232 --> 23:55.868
- Yes.

23:55.935 --> 23:58.437
I'm looking for Owen Quine.
I thought he might be here.

23:58.505 --> 24:00.039
No.

24:00.106 --> 24:02.308
- He can go to hell.

24:02.374 --> 24:03.543
'I'm an investigator.'

24:03.610 --> 24:05.578
'His wife's very worried
for him.'

24:05.645 --> 24:07.814
Thought he might be
staying with you.

24:10.182 --> 24:12.552
You took his writing class,
didn't you?

24:12.619 --> 24:14.487
We were friends.

24:14.554 --> 24:16.756
He said he'd write me
into his new book.

24:16.823 --> 24:19.726
'And then he posted
a copy through my door.'

24:19.792 --> 24:21.928
I hope I never see him again.

24:31.170 --> 24:32.639
It's an odd one though.

24:32.705 --> 24:35.041
Sending it to his girlfriend,
knowing it'd hurt her.

24:35.107 --> 24:36.442
It seems nihilistic.

24:36.509 --> 24:38.110
It's like a suicide note.

24:38.177 --> 24:40.446
Railing against the world
that called your last novel

24:40.513 --> 24:42.615
"Sphincter-clenchingly awful."

24:42.682 --> 24:45.351
Is that a real review?

24:45.417 --> 24:47.620
That was one of the better ones.

24:49.021 --> 24:52.024
I'm heading to Leonora's
to ask some more questions, uh..

24:52.091 --> 24:53.693
- Uh..

24:53.760 --> 24:56.095
I can't tonight, um..

24:56.162 --> 24:57.797
Yeah, okay.

24:57.864 --> 24:58.631
'Oh..'

24:58.698 --> 25:01.467
I've done the searches.

25:01.534 --> 25:05.037
Might be worth asking her about
her husband co-owning a house

25:05.104 --> 25:06.739
on Talgarth Road.

25:08.307 --> 25:09.976
I know.

25:10.042 --> 25:12.278
Yeah, but he never goes there.
I don't even know if we've got--

25:12.344 --> 25:14.413
Might have been worth mentioning
given he's been missing

25:14.480 --> 25:15.748
for nearly a fortnight now.

25:15.815 --> 25:17.750
He owns it with Andrew Fancourt

25:17.817 --> 25:19.719
so we can't ever do
anything with it.

25:19.786 --> 25:21.888
Their mate, Joe, left it
to them when he died

25:21.954 --> 25:24.691
and sometimes, they get it
rented out to artists and that.

25:24.757 --> 25:27.627
But mostly, Andrew won't
let them make money off it

25:27.694 --> 25:29.862
just to piss Owen off.

25:32.531 --> 25:33.700
Here you are.

25:37.503 --> 25:40.940
He won't be there.
It's a wreck.

25:41.007 --> 25:43.175
Did he leave you a copy
of his new manuscript

25:43.242 --> 25:44.443
by any chance?

25:44.510 --> 25:46.078
Oh, yeah.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.954
'He left it for me
by the front door.'

25:55.021 --> 25:57.323
He knows I'm not gonna
read it like that.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.692
I only read 'em when there's
a cover and it's proper

25:59.759 --> 26:01.327
even if he reckons it's good.

26:03.896 --> 26:07.199
So, he posted this
into his own home?

26:07.266 --> 26:08.701
Well, I don't know.
It was on the doormat.

26:08.768 --> 26:12.038
- It was just sat there.
- Hm.

26:12.104 --> 26:14.674
'Can't see any box files
for "Bombyx Mori."'

26:14.741 --> 26:15.908
Oh, there will be.

26:15.975 --> 26:17.243
He's always gettin' some idea

26:17.309 --> 26:19.211
and it has to go down
before he forgets.

26:19.278 --> 26:21.748
Apart from Jerry and Liz,
have you had any visitors

26:21.814 --> 26:24.016
since Owen disappeared?

26:24.083 --> 26:26.786
His publisher rang,
but he didn't come over.

26:26.853 --> 26:28.755
People don't, really.

26:28.821 --> 26:30.022
Do they, Dodo?

26:39.265 --> 26:41.033
Do you like to draw?

26:41.100 --> 26:42.068
Yes.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.404
And I take things.

26:45.471 --> 26:49.141
Yeah, we talked about that,
didn't we, Dodo?

26:51.043 --> 26:53.680
She pinches things
and sticks them in her monkey.

26:56.649 --> 26:58.785
Who's that man?

26:58.851 --> 27:01.553
He's helpin' us find daddy.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.155
- I want daddy.
- Oh!

27:03.222 --> 27:05.658
I know you do, hon.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.661
Say what you like about him

27:08.728 --> 27:11.263
but Owen does
a good bedtime story.

27:12.899 --> 27:15.601
My name is Cormoran Strike.

27:15.668 --> 27:17.937
That's not a name.

27:18.004 --> 27:21.007
I was named
after a Cornish Giant.

27:23.342 --> 27:24.977
Could I borrow this?

27:26.713 --> 27:28.848
Go foryour life.

27:35.955 --> 27:38.357
Hey, babes. How was work?

27:38.424 --> 27:40.092
FSA are bringin' in new regs.

27:40.159 --> 27:42.528
So, we have to get
on top of that one

27:42.594 --> 27:44.196
with the client business.

27:44.263 --> 27:47.166
And I've had mum on the phone
complainin' about a headache.

27:47.233 --> 27:49.101
Is she alright?

27:49.168 --> 27:51.670
Yeah. Just shit on attention.

27:55.441 --> 27:57.376
That's a good-looking omelet.

29:44.283 --> 29:45.551
Come on, then.

29:52.758 --> 29:54.160
Robin, I'm going
to Quine's house.

29:54.226 --> 29:56.262
Some intel to go through.

29:56.328 --> 29:58.330
Give "Bombyx" a read,
would you?

29:58.397 --> 30:00.466
See if you can make
any sense of it.

30:10.977 --> 30:12.578
Cormoran Strike's office.

30:15.114 --> 30:17.016
Yes, I-I am so sorry

30:17.083 --> 30:19.385
that he was detained
on another case.

30:20.887 --> 30:23.789
'Yeah, well, he, he can
still see you tomorrow.'

30:23.856 --> 30:26.058
Okay, I'm so sorry
about that. Bye.

30:59.825 --> 31:01.493
Oh!

32:38.690 --> 32:39.858
He's dead.

32:39.925 --> 32:41.493
I found his body
at that address.

32:41.560 --> 32:45.464
- The police are there now.
- Oh, my God!

32:45.531 --> 32:46.932
Does his wife know?

32:46.999 --> 32:49.235
Police are there too.

32:49.301 --> 32:52.438
It's a really odd murder scene.

32:52.504 --> 32:54.406
It's quite disturbing,
pictures are pretty grim.

32:54.473 --> 32:56.608
Uh..

32:58.844 --> 33:00.079
Sorry.

33:10.022 --> 33:11.423
'Jesus..'

33:14.393 --> 33:16.428
It's demented, gutting someone

33:16.495 --> 33:18.630
and taking
their intestines away.

33:19.665 --> 33:22.634
Uh, you have to read this.

33:24.703 --> 33:27.005
Look at the last chapter.

33:27.073 --> 33:28.307
You finished it already?

33:28.374 --> 33:31.577
Oh, I skipped to the end.
I always do.

33:31.643 --> 33:32.878
Read it, go on.

33:53.899 --> 33:55.801
No! No!

34:22.128 --> 34:25.431
The hero dies in exactly
the same way Quine did.

34:25.497 --> 34:27.032
Tied up, guts torn out.

34:27.099 --> 34:29.335
Uh, it must be the grimmest
part of the book

34:29.401 --> 34:31.603
and someone made him
re-enact it.

34:36.208 --> 34:38.344
Sorry, I'm just gonna, um..

34:39.845 --> 34:41.780
Hi, are you okay?

34:45.551 --> 34:46.518
When?

34:49.788 --> 34:51.623
Where are you now?

34:51.690 --> 34:53.825
Right.
I-I-I'll come straight away.

34:54.826 --> 34:56.495
Okay. I love you.

34:57.696 --> 34:59.365
Everything okay?

35:01.500 --> 35:03.635
Matt's mum just died.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.640
Um..

35:08.707 --> 35:12.144
U-uh.. She had a stroke.

35:12.211 --> 35:13.879
Tell him I'm sorry, will you?

35:13.945 --> 35:15.881
Yeah, um..

35:15.947 --> 35:19.285
Uh, I'm gonna get the tube,
and then I'll, um..

35:19.351 --> 35:21.487
I-I'll call you later.

35:45.777 --> 35:47.613
Mystic Bob.

35:47.679 --> 35:49.248
Hello, mate.

35:49.315 --> 35:51.317
Oh, it's good to see ya.

35:51.383 --> 35:53.118
I pulled a few strings
to get the case once I heard

35:53.185 --> 35:54.686
it's one of yours.
How are ya?

35:54.753 --> 35:55.954
How's the fiancee?

35:56.021 --> 35:59.057
- We broke up.
- No.

35:59.124 --> 36:02.194
Shit. Sorry, mate.

36:02.261 --> 36:03.762
- Wha--

36:03.829 --> 36:05.731
How about forensics?

36:05.797 --> 36:08.800
Time of death's
gonna be a bastard.

36:08.867 --> 36:11.503
Guts are missing,
so there's no last meal to date

36:11.570 --> 36:13.171
and then,
there's acid everywhere.

36:13.239 --> 36:16.342
Even the flies stayed off the
body, so we've got no maggots.

36:16.408 --> 36:18.410
Neighbors saw a woman
in a burka comin' out

36:18.477 --> 36:20.846
of the property about
ten days ago with a sports bag.

36:20.912 --> 36:22.381
Burka's not a bad disguise.

36:22.448 --> 36:24.850
Do we assume the bag was full
of Quine's intestines?

36:24.916 --> 36:26.485
It seems so, yeah.

36:26.552 --> 36:28.387
We'll have the dogs
search the rubbish dumps.

36:28.454 --> 36:30.256
We've got a suspect as well.

36:30.322 --> 36:32.524
The wife.
He was having an affair.

36:32.591 --> 36:34.760
Probably gonna leave her,
but if he dies

36:34.826 --> 36:36.795
she gets a nice
insurance payout.

36:36.862 --> 36:39.130
She's got a key to this place.
All adds up.

36:39.197 --> 36:40.532
I don't think
she had the ingenuity

36:40.599 --> 36:42.501
to pull off
something like this

36:42.568 --> 36:44.169
and she hired me to find him.

36:44.236 --> 36:45.537
You don't have
the full picture, mate.

36:45.604 --> 36:46.938
We talked to the neighbors.

36:47.005 --> 36:48.374
Massive argument in the street

36:48.440 --> 36:49.675
the night before he goes.

36:49.741 --> 36:51.677
Did she tell you that?
And get this.

36:51.743 --> 36:55.146
Before she married him, worked
in her uncle's butcher shop

36:55.213 --> 36:56.382
in Hay-on-Wye

36:56.448 --> 36:58.517
gutting pigs, the works.

36:58.584 --> 36:59.618
Oh!

37:01.219 --> 37:02.721
This is my mate, Cormoran.

37:02.788 --> 37:04.390
Ex-SIB.

37:04.456 --> 37:06.558
- The bloke that saved my life.
- Hi.

37:06.625 --> 37:08.760
I've heard lots about you
from Richard.

37:08.827 --> 37:11.430
He just finished a manuscript
for his new book.

37:11.497 --> 37:14.700
He made some very unpleasant
allegations about people he knew

37:14.766 --> 37:17.135
each of them has a motive, if
that's what you're looking for.

37:17.202 --> 37:20.138
- But only if they'd read it.
- The killer definitely did.

37:20.205 --> 37:21.540
Quine was killed
in the exact same way

37:21.607 --> 37:23.208
as the hero from his book.

37:23.275 --> 37:26.244
Tied up, gutted,
laid out to be eaten.

37:26.312 --> 37:28.414
Bloody hell.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.616
Is Leonora Quine in it?

37:31.517 --> 37:32.618
Yes.

37:34.052 --> 37:37.289
Not hard for her to get a look
at his work in progress.

38:27.172 --> 38:29.140
'She's upset.'

38:29.207 --> 38:30.642
It's all the coming and going.

38:30.709 --> 38:32.644
They asked her questions.

38:32.711 --> 38:35.781
I told them what she's like,
but they still did.

38:35.847 --> 38:37.383
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Yeah.

38:37.449 --> 38:38.950
That's what they said as well,
but with them

38:39.017 --> 38:41.453
you can see it's like
they have to say it.

38:43.021 --> 38:45.457
I can't do much more
for you now, Leonora.

38:45.524 --> 38:47.493
This is a murder case.

38:47.559 --> 38:49.127
There's no charge
for the work we've done

38:49.194 --> 38:50.295
so please
don't worry about that.

38:50.362 --> 38:51.830
Sis!

38:53.999 --> 38:56.768
They dug out photos.

38:56.835 --> 38:58.904
These were private photos,
and they were all like

38:58.970 --> 39:00.872
"Look, there's him
tied up by you."

39:00.939 --> 39:02.508
And I'm saying, "Yeah,
but that's what he liked."

39:02.574 --> 39:05.777
How does that mean
anything to anyone?

39:05.844 --> 39:08.547
I can recommend a good lawyer,
she's an old friend of mine.

39:08.614 --> 39:09.715
If they question you again--

39:09.781 --> 39:11.950
Why have I got
to pay for a lawyer now?

39:12.017 --> 39:13.919
All I ever done
was look for him.

39:13.985 --> 39:16.054
Everybody, quiet!

39:16.121 --> 39:18.824
It's alright, Dodo.

39:18.890 --> 39:20.492
It's alright.

39:20.559 --> 39:24.463
Let's do a cloud.

39:24.530 --> 39:26.264
'I want daddy.'

39:26.331 --> 39:31.036
- Daddy!

39:31.102 --> 39:32.137
Birds?

39:34.973 --> 39:36.775
A blue bird?

39:39.177 --> 39:41.413
- Red.

39:41.480 --> 39:44.082
There's a red pencil
for you then, Dodo.

39:44.149 --> 39:46.452
Now, you put it there.

40:00.866 --> 40:04.169
I'm a bit scared they are gonna
take me away from her.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.706
She can't manage it.

40:09.040 --> 40:11.510
It's only ever been
me and Owen.

40:35.801 --> 40:37.969
It's great. Thank you.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.743
- 11:00.

40:46.111 --> 40:47.979
Do you think you could get
the day off?

40:48.046 --> 40:49.981
Yeah, I'd like to, um..

40:51.817 --> 40:53.084
I'll ask.

41:10.201 --> 41:11.737
How long have you been up?

41:11.803 --> 41:13.572
You sent me an email at 5 a.m.

41:13.639 --> 41:15.774
The police think
Leonora killed Quine.

41:15.841 --> 41:18.309
She needs our help.

41:18.376 --> 41:20.712
- He's, uh..

41:21.780 --> 41:24.249
Her funeral's already arranged.

41:24.315 --> 41:25.984
He's going up today.

41:27.919 --> 41:30.055
Take whatever time you need.

41:33.424 --> 41:37.062
We've been getting a lot
of complaints from clients.

41:37.128 --> 41:39.931
The work with Leonora
has really put us back.

41:42.300 --> 41:45.336
I'm makin' a list of people
we know have been ridiculed

41:45.403 --> 41:47.272
or slandered in the book.

41:47.338 --> 41:48.874
Leonora, Liz Tassel..

41:48.940 --> 41:51.409
- Succuba, and The Tick.
- Yeah.

41:51.476 --> 41:53.378
Judging by how angry she is,
I'm guessing

41:53.444 --> 41:54.746
Kathryn Kent's in there too.

41:54.813 --> 41:57.415
I think she's Harpy.

41:57.482 --> 42:00.786
I know what he says about the
three of them is really cruel

42:00.852 --> 42:03.254
but there are others
that come off a lot worse.

42:03.321 --> 42:05.857
Well, Liz mentioned the book
was attacking his publisher

42:05.924 --> 42:08.660
Daniel Chard,
he could be The Cutter

42:08.727 --> 42:11.863
Phallus Impudicus,
Vainglorious..

42:11.930 --> 42:14.132
One of the really nasty ones.

42:14.199 --> 42:16.568
Chard called me this morning,
he doesn't wanna risk

42:16.635 --> 42:18.036
meeting us in London,
and he's paranoid

42:18.103 --> 42:20.271
about his fund being tapped,
which is probably sensible.

42:20.338 --> 42:22.073
So I'm gonna have to meet him
in bloody Devon.

42:22.140 --> 42:24.542
I'll need a hired car
booked for tomorrow.

42:24.610 --> 42:26.077
I'll drive us.

42:28.113 --> 42:29.214
You sure?

42:29.280 --> 42:30.949
I could probably manage
with an automatic.

42:31.016 --> 42:33.785
No, I'm sure. I'll drive us.
Definitely.

42:46.932 --> 42:49.567
I'm really sorry. I'm not gonna
be able to get away today.

42:49.635 --> 42:52.337
We're just so over-stretched
on this case we're working on

42:52.403 --> 42:55.306
and I've got a meeting
at the British Library tomorrow

42:55.373 --> 42:57.342
that I tried to move, but..

42:57.408 --> 43:00.311
Anyway, the good news
is it's around the corner

43:00.378 --> 43:03.081
from the station, and I've got
a ticket for the 8:00 p.m.

43:03.148 --> 43:05.951
So, I will be with you all
as soon as I can.

43:07.218 --> 43:08.419
I'm sorry, Matt.

43:08.486 --> 43:12.924
Um, give my love to your dad
and, uh, I love you.

43:30.475 --> 43:33.679
Why does he have
to live in Devon?

43:34.646 --> 43:36.614
At least it's not Cornwall.

44:09.748 --> 44:12.383
Ah. Thanks for coming.

44:13.484 --> 44:14.720
Hi.

44:16.822 --> 44:18.523
Um, would you..

44:18.589 --> 44:20.658
We're, uh, shoes off.

44:20.726 --> 44:22.193
- If you don't mind.
- Oh, no problem.

44:27.598 --> 44:28.767
Oh, sorry, I'd forgotten.

44:28.834 --> 44:32.403
Um, why, why don't you
leave yours on?

44:35.006 --> 44:38.209
- Oh, uh, relatively speaking.

44:38.276 --> 44:40.779
- Oh, no.

44:40.846 --> 44:42.814
I mean, it's a sprain.

44:42.881 --> 44:44.282
That's all.

44:44.349 --> 44:45.550
Tea

44:45.616 --> 44:47.485
- Coffee will be great.
- Yeah.

44:47.552 --> 44:49.020
Manny!

44:51.957 --> 44:55.260
Would you please make coffee
for our guests?

44:57.863 --> 44:59.865
Hmm.

44:59.931 --> 45:01.466
He doesn't like it down here.

45:01.532 --> 45:04.202
'He wants to be back in London.'

45:04.269 --> 45:06.772
Horrible news about Quine.

45:06.838 --> 45:08.706
How are his sales?

45:08.774 --> 45:10.408
Oh, improving.

45:12.243 --> 45:15.914
Look, what I have to say
is, uh, confidential.

45:18.917 --> 45:22.520
Would you mind waiting
in the kitchen?

45:22.587 --> 45:24.055
Sure.

45:35.433 --> 45:38.469
Look, I'm fairly confident

45:38.536 --> 45:41.973
well, I mean, almost certain
that "Bombyx Mori"

45:42.040 --> 45:44.275
is not the work of one person.

45:44.342 --> 45:47.578
Quine must have had
an accomplice.

45:47.645 --> 45:48.780
How can you tell?

45:48.847 --> 45:50.748
Well, the style seems like his

45:50.816 --> 45:53.018
certainly, but..

45:53.084 --> 45:56.221
Something's in it I doubt
he could possibly have known.

46:00.091 --> 46:01.860
And I've been in books
all my life.

46:01.927 --> 46:04.796
A-a writer's voice
is particular.

46:06.798 --> 46:10.268
- Hard to substantiate.
- Heh. I know.

46:12.070 --> 46:14.639
If you can prove definitively

46:14.705 --> 46:16.875
who authored the book

46:16.942 --> 46:19.344
I'll pay you 10,000 pounds.

46:26.852 --> 46:28.319
I hate gossip..

46:30.021 --> 46:32.057
...and believing that

46:32.123 --> 46:34.492
maybe someone I know told Quine

46:34.559 --> 46:36.327
private things about me.

46:39.097 --> 46:42.267
"
- I have.

46:42.333 --> 46:45.036
Well, it's especially savage
about me

46:45.103 --> 46:48.206
and about the writer,
Andrew Fancourt.

46:48.273 --> 46:51.776
I asked Andrew to join me
in suing to prevent publication

46:51.843 --> 46:55.346
but that seems moot

46:55.413 --> 46:57.348
since Quine has been..

46:58.616 --> 47:00.585
- You know.
- Disemboweled.

47:03.188 --> 47:04.289
Yeah.

47:08.994 --> 47:12.763
What does Quine allege
about you both?

47:12.830 --> 47:15.000
Well, in Andrews's case

47:15.066 --> 47:18.169
he implies that Andrew himself

47:18.236 --> 47:21.907
wrote a nasty parody
of his late wife's novel.

47:21.973 --> 47:23.942
She killed herself over it.

47:24.009 --> 47:25.944
Andrew found her
on the kitchen floor

47:26.011 --> 47:28.479
with the parody
pinned to her chest.

47:30.215 --> 47:32.117
Has Mr. Fancourt read "Bombyx?"

47:32.183 --> 47:34.585
Uh, no, but I gave him a gist.

47:36.487 --> 47:39.857
Fancourt and Quine were close
before they fell out.

47:41.359 --> 47:44.229
- Liz Tassel.

47:46.231 --> 47:48.633
Uh, she represented them both..

47:48.699 --> 47:50.768
...for a while.

47:50.835 --> 47:54.672
Liz told everyone
that Quine was a genius

47:54.739 --> 47:57.943
and she had a huge crush
on Andrew.

47:58.009 --> 47:59.978
Not a woman..

48:00.045 --> 48:02.981
...who always gets it right.

48:03.048 --> 48:04.749
And not least

48:04.815 --> 48:07.118
in sending out "Bombyx Mori."

48:13.691 --> 48:15.793
I'm just going to use the loo.

48:15.860 --> 48:17.262
Are you friends of his?

48:17.328 --> 48:20.165
We're private investigators.

48:20.231 --> 48:21.732
I didn't push him
down the stairs.

48:21.799 --> 48:25.503
- He fell.
- Okay.

48:25.570 --> 48:29.074
- It's downstairs.

48:35.146 --> 48:36.847
I'm just trying to think
if there's anything else

48:36.914 --> 48:40.218
I need to ask. Er..

48:40.285 --> 48:41.786
Um, look

48:41.852 --> 48:44.555
I-I have a call
with "New Yorker."

48:46.591 --> 48:49.760
I'm sorry the coffee
didn't materialize.

48:49.827 --> 48:52.197
Manny's a little bit..

48:52.263 --> 48:54.299
Well..

48:54.365 --> 48:55.600
Oh.

48:56.834 --> 48:59.770
Take a look at Jerry Waldegrave.

48:59.837 --> 49:01.872
He'll be at our
centennial party.

49:01.939 --> 49:04.075
I'll put you on the list.

49:05.910 --> 49:08.346
Need to retrieve my assistant.

49:08.413 --> 49:10.581
Oh, yes. Manny.

49:16.154 --> 49:18.256
Forget about the coffee.

49:18.323 --> 49:21.592
Would you please fetch
Mr. Strike's assistant?

49:21.659 --> 49:22.960
All done, Mr. Strike?

49:24.762 --> 49:26.131
Think so.

50:07.872 --> 50:11.276
Go on then, speak your heart.

50:11.342 --> 50:13.344
Really, I'm fine.

50:16.514 --> 50:18.649
Chard ended up telling me
a lot of useful things.

50:18.716 --> 50:22.153
The book might've
had multiple authors.

50:22.220 --> 50:24.555
I got the impression Quine
knew a lot of damaging stuff

50:24.622 --> 50:27.825
so maybe he was killed
to stop further revelations.

50:27.892 --> 50:31.529
Chard avoided telling me
what Quine knew about him.

50:31.596 --> 50:33.231
I can guess, though.

50:34.165 --> 50:36.334
Well..

50:36.401 --> 50:37.968
I wasn't gonna stop him talking

50:38.035 --> 50:39.337
by pickin' him up
on his manners.

50:39.404 --> 50:42.240
No, it's really, it's not
about that, it's just..

50:44.642 --> 50:48.346
- As in--

50:48.413 --> 50:51.716
I mean, what were you intending
when you hired me?

50:51.782 --> 50:54.018
Because..

50:54.085 --> 50:56.287
...I've been working
really hard--

50:56.354 --> 50:58.823
I know. I've noticed.

51:01.692 --> 51:04.595
You said you're gonna take on
another investigator.

51:07.198 --> 51:10.235
Okay, okay. Listen, just..

51:10.301 --> 51:11.802
You might not like
what I'm gonna say

51:11.869 --> 51:13.804
but just let me get it out.

51:16.341 --> 51:19.144
I did take you on thinking
I could train you.

51:19.210 --> 51:21.512
Of course, I didn't have
the money for that

51:21.579 --> 51:25.049
but I reckoned
you could learn on the job..

51:25.116 --> 51:26.617
...until..

51:28.419 --> 51:29.787
...well, you're getting
married to someone

51:29.854 --> 51:31.789
who hates you doing this.

51:38.429 --> 51:42.099
I'm not gonna ask you to ruin
your marriage over a job.

51:43.468 --> 51:44.869
Have you told Matthew
about today?

51:44.935 --> 51:47.672
Uh-huh. No, not yet.

51:47.738 --> 51:49.907
I'll need a partner
who can share the long hours

51:49.974 --> 51:52.677
who can give up their weekend
at the drop of a hat.

51:52.743 --> 51:54.312
I wouldn't ask that
of an assistant

51:54.379 --> 51:57.448
but I'd demand it of a partner.

51:57.515 --> 52:00.117
That's what broke
me and Charlotte up in the end

52:00.185 --> 52:02.320
amongst other things.

52:02.387 --> 52:03.854
She hated what I do.

52:03.921 --> 52:06.224
I hated that when she finally
demanded that I choose

52:06.291 --> 52:08.125
I chose the job over her.

52:13.631 --> 52:15.266
If it's what you really want,
then I'll put you

52:15.333 --> 52:16.834
on a surveillance course
when I get the money

52:16.901 --> 52:18.803
but I'm not spending that
on an assistant.

52:18.869 --> 52:21.672
That is what I want.

52:21.739 --> 52:23.674
This is what I love.

52:29.580 --> 52:31.449
Then cheer the fuck up
and give me that sandwich

52:31.516 --> 52:32.750
if you're not going to eat it.

52:32.817 --> 52:34.252
It's not a good sandwich.

52:34.319 --> 52:36.587
- Too much onion.
- There's no such thing.

52:40.658 --> 52:42.627
Uh..

52:42.693 --> 52:44.429
Can we get going?

52:44.495 --> 52:47.031
If I don't make my train,
I'll miss the funeral.

52:47.097 --> 52:50.201
Don't. Don't, let's just go.

53:09.787 --> 53:12.523
Bollocks.

53:12.590 --> 53:14.859
I'm gonna see what's happening.

53:32.477 --> 53:34.545
- Sorry about this.
- Oh, uh..

53:34.612 --> 53:36.414
And they're not gonna be able
to get in to tow it out.

53:36.481 --> 53:38.683
It's an idiotic place
to break down.

53:50.428 --> 53:52.597
Can you open that gate?

54:28.833 --> 54:30.234
Hey, this is a bit..

54:30.301 --> 54:32.503
Uh, I've got this, trust me.

55:36.501 --> 55:38.803
Where did you learn
to drive like that?

55:38.869 --> 55:40.838
Oh, I've, um,
I've always loved driving.

55:40.905 --> 55:43.508
I used to practice in the field
with my uncle doing the pedals--

55:43.574 --> 55:46.977
Yeah, but that wasn't
just enjoying driving.

55:47.044 --> 55:50.715
I, um, did
an advanced driving course.

55:50.781 --> 55:52.883
The year I left the uni. Well.

55:52.950 --> 55:53.718
Something to do.

55:53.784 --> 55:55.953
Got me out of the house a bit.

55:57.455 --> 55:58.856
'Signal's back.'

56:01.892 --> 56:03.428
'Andrew Fancourt here.'

56:03.494 --> 56:05.896
'I have no comment to make
on "Bombyx Mori."'

56:05.963 --> 56:08.399
'I haven't read it,
and I don't intend to.'

56:08.466 --> 56:11.068
'And nor do I have
any valedictory words'

56:11.135 --> 56:14.104
'for Owen Quine,
I disliked him both as a man'

56:14.171 --> 56:15.506
'and as a writer.'

56:15.573 --> 56:17.808
'I hope that helps.'

56:17.875 --> 56:18.943
Oh.

56:31.522 --> 56:33.524
I can't just leave her, can I?

56:33.591 --> 56:35.025
Is there anyone you can call?

56:35.092 --> 56:37.562
Oh, God! This isn't happenin'!

56:38.629 --> 56:40.965
Come inside, love, you have to.

56:41.031 --> 56:43.100
Be a good friend,
and be a good girl.

56:43.167 --> 56:44.368
She will.

56:44.435 --> 56:45.670
Call him,
tell him what's happened.

56:45.736 --> 56:47.505
I will, I promise.

56:48.873 --> 56:52.209
I'll be home soon, Dodo.
I promise.

57:32.149 --> 57:33.618
Thank you.

57:33.684 --> 57:36.654
Thanks. Goodbye.

58:15.960 --> 58:17.595
Excuse me.

58:17.662 --> 58:20.330
- Yeah.

58:20.397 --> 58:24.201
I'll pay you 20 quid if you
drove me home in this car.

58:24.268 --> 58:26.170
And, uh, why can't you do it?

58:28.438 --> 58:29.640
I've only got one leg

58:29.707 --> 58:32.409
and my driver had to go home.

58:32.476 --> 58:35.279
Do you want more money or
is it the situation as a whole

58:35.345 --> 58:37.414
that's making you hesitate?

58:41.418 --> 58:43.053
Excuse me.

58:45.823 --> 58:48.325
Arrested or charged?

59:22.893 --> 59:24.328
I'm asking you these questions

59:24.394 --> 59:25.529
to try to keep you
out of prison.

59:25.596 --> 59:26.664
Well, I didn't do anything.

59:26.731 --> 59:27.898
That's enough, innit?

59:27.965 --> 59:29.266
The ugly truth is
it might not be.

59:29.333 --> 59:30.801
What does she mean,
"It might not be?"

59:30.868 --> 59:32.402
You were supposed
to keep me out of here.

59:32.469 --> 59:33.671
You promised.

59:35.072 --> 59:37.341
But Fancourt's in "Bombyx Mori."
You'd have thought--

59:37.407 --> 59:38.709
I'm not sure the Met's Literary

59:38.776 --> 59:40.678
Criticism Unit
was brought in on this one.

59:40.745 --> 59:42.479
Well, he's certainly got
the imagination for it.

59:42.546 --> 59:44.782
Lots of the profile
pieces you read on him

59:44.849 --> 59:46.617
talk about
how he writes violence.

59:46.684 --> 59:50.120
Could Fancourt kill a man?

59:50.187 --> 59:53.090
Well, he's very good
at writing hate.

59:53.157 --> 59:56.226
The one-legged detective, I've
read about you, Mr. Strike--

59:56.293 --> 59:58.095
I've been looking
into Owen Quine's death.

59:58.162 --> 1:00:00.197
I was hoping we'd have
a chance to talk.

1:00:00.264 --> 1:00:02.767
Well, here we are.

1:00:03.467 --> 1:00:04.902
Robin!
