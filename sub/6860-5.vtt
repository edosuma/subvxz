00:16.297 --> 00:18.865
War in the Inner Rim!

00:18.932 --> 00:21.467
Rebel leader Steela Gerrera
has joined forces

00:21.535 --> 00:24.136
with General Tandin
after boldly rescuing

00:24.204 --> 00:26.638
Onderon's former king from execution,

00:26.706 --> 00:29.674
evading a trap set
by Separatist ally King Rash

00:29.742 --> 00:31.743
and the droid general Kalani.

00:31.811 --> 00:34.545
Amid growing public support
and rising unrest,

00:34.613 --> 00:37.214
Ahsoka continues to monitor
the rebels' efforts

00:37.282 --> 00:39.383
as they rally around Ramsis Dendup

00:39.451 --> 00:42.253
to restore his reign
as the rightful king

00:42.321 --> 00:43.755
and finally put an end

00:43.822 --> 00:46.157
to the Separatist occupation
of Onderon.

01:01.173 --> 01:03.942
I'm picking up
an electromagnetic field.

01:04.010 --> 01:07.245
Roger, roger.
It's coming from there.

01:13.653 --> 01:15.020
Whoa!

01:15.088 --> 01:19.725
My fellow subjects,
I appear not as your king

01:19.793 --> 01:22.528
but as a servant of Onderon.

01:22.596 --> 01:25.564
We are in the midst
of a great struggle.

01:25.632 --> 01:28.434
The Confederacy has used
the recent attacks

01:28.501 --> 01:33.472
as an opportunity to tighten
their hold on Onderon.

01:33.540 --> 01:38.210
They have accused me of leading
these so-called terrorists.

01:38.278 --> 01:41.046
It is a lie they have engineered

01:41.114 --> 01:43.783
to further restrict your independence

01:43.850 --> 01:47.454
and use deadly force
against our people.

01:47.521 --> 01:51.258
The truth is, I have never
met them before now.

01:51.326 --> 01:55.663
I have come to know them
as the true sons of Onderon.

01:55.731 --> 01:58.799
They are unwilling
to surrender our freedom

01:58.867 --> 02:02.403
to those who conspire
to take it from us.

02:02.471 --> 02:07.175
Our destiny is tied to them
and this planet.

02:07.243 --> 02:10.745
We must all rise together
to protect it.

02:15.884 --> 02:17.218
Uh-oh.

02:17.285 --> 02:20.654
Why are they looking at us that way?

02:20.722 --> 02:23.925
Hey!

02:23.992 --> 02:25.826
What the?
Blast them!

02:30.132 --> 02:32.266
Ahh!

02:32.334 --> 02:33.634
Uh-oh.

02:54.323 --> 02:56.191
The people are
turning against the droids.

02:56.259 --> 02:57.859
There's rioting in the streets now.

02:57.927 --> 03:00.195
That's a beautiful thing.

03:00.263 --> 03:03.932
We need to keep the battle
to the outskirts of the city.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.168
Less structures and people.

03:06.236 --> 03:09.572
But less clankers.
Their main force is in Iziz.

03:09.639 --> 03:11.140
We should join the fight down there

03:11.207 --> 03:13.075
and take it straight to King Rash.

03:13.143 --> 03:17.113
We all want victory, but not
at the cost of innocent lives.

03:17.180 --> 03:19.882
If we fight door to door,
no one is safe.

03:19.949 --> 03:22.217
This is war, Steela.

03:22.285 --> 03:23.485
She's right.

03:23.553 --> 03:24.953
I agree.

03:25.021 --> 03:27.389
The more you draw the droids
from the city to the highlands,

03:27.457 --> 03:29.625
the safer the people will be.

03:29.692 --> 03:31.960
My men await your command, my Lord.

03:32.028 --> 03:35.831
I believe there's a new contender.

03:35.899 --> 03:40.402
<i>You</i> will lead our forces,
including the Royal Army.

03:40.469 --> 03:43.706
Steela is now the commanding general.

03:43.773 --> 03:46.809
A great choice.

03:46.876 --> 03:49.011
As you wish, my Lord.

03:49.078 --> 03:53.014
You and your rebels
renewed my faith in myself.

03:53.082 --> 03:56.318
Now I'm putting my faith in you.

03:56.386 --> 03:59.454
Thank you, Your Majesty.

03:59.522 --> 04:01.490
Let's ride.

04:17.406 --> 04:19.408
Just in case.

04:45.171 --> 04:47.973
We are losing the public.

04:48.040 --> 04:51.743
If they turn against us,
I fear the outcome.

04:51.810 --> 04:54.579
Fear will bring them back.

04:54.646 --> 04:56.981
We must eliminate Dendup,
General Tandin,

04:57.049 --> 04:58.216
and the terrorists

04:58.284 --> 05:00.852
before the people
commit to their efforts.

05:00.920 --> 05:02.954
General Tandin is weak.

05:03.021 --> 05:06.925
His army will not withstand
the power of the Confederacy.

05:06.993 --> 05:09.561
Neither will the terrorists.

05:09.628 --> 05:13.164
General, our scouts have
located the main rebel forces

05:13.231 --> 05:15.933
in the mountains to the east.

05:16.001 --> 05:18.302
With the rioting in the city,
how can we spare the troops

05:18.370 --> 05:20.338
to attack the rebels in the mountains?

05:20.405 --> 05:23.474
Do not underestimate our means.

05:23.542 --> 05:25.276
If the rebel army falls,

05:25.343 --> 05:28.513
the citizens will lose their courage,

05:28.580 --> 05:30.881
and order will be restored.

05:39.859 --> 05:42.760
Your target lies
in the mountains to the east.

05:42.828 --> 05:44.362
The army will follow.

05:44.430 --> 05:47.398
Leave no survivors.
Go.

05:47.466 --> 05:49.934
By your command.

06:07.980 --> 06:09.648
The droid army is almost here.

06:09.889 --> 06:12.724
Everyone, get ready.

06:27.740 --> 06:28.707
Ready.

06:28.774 --> 06:31.310
Saw, begin your attack.

06:46.425 --> 06:47.425
Yah!

07:30.703 --> 07:32.637
Ahh!

07:32.705 --> 07:33.704
No!

07:33.772 --> 07:35.273
Where did that come from?

07:35.340 --> 07:37.341
There.

07:39.811 --> 07:41.412
Any ideas?

07:41.479 --> 07:42.980
Yeah.
Run!

08:12.878 --> 08:13.845
Ahh!

08:32.998 --> 08:35.566
I take it the rebels
have Dooku's full attention.

08:35.634 --> 08:37.101
It's a full-scale war.

08:37.169 --> 08:38.503
They need our help.

08:38.570 --> 08:40.238
Please talk to the Council.

08:40.304 --> 08:43.174
Even Master Windu
would be wary at this point.

08:43.241 --> 08:45.944
The Council will not
engage or involve the Republic

08:46.011 --> 08:47.545
in an internal affair.

08:47.613 --> 08:49.146
The Separatists have a new gunship

08:49.214 --> 08:50.648
with a powerful ray shield.

08:50.715 --> 08:52.416
Nothing's getting past it.

08:52.483 --> 08:53.984
I am sorry, Ahsoka.

08:54.052 --> 08:55.919
They will have to find a way.

08:55.987 --> 08:58.822
Do not stay there
if their failure is certain.

08:58.889 --> 09:02.358
Evacuate who you can and return
to Coruscant immediately.

09:02.426 --> 09:03.659
Do you understand?

09:03.727 --> 09:06.562
Yes, Master.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.197
We need to help them.

09:08.264 --> 09:11.534
We will do what we can
to relocate the survivors.

09:11.602 --> 09:13.469
Before they lose their planet.

09:13.537 --> 09:15.404
We can't.

09:15.472 --> 09:16.806
What difference does it make now?

09:16.873 --> 09:19.442
The Separatists know we're involved.

09:19.509 --> 09:21.678
I don't disagree with you, Anakin,

09:21.745 --> 09:25.549
but to send in Republic gunships
defeats our purpose.

09:25.617 --> 09:28.252
We must stay true to our intentions,

09:28.319 --> 09:30.220
learn our lessons.

09:30.288 --> 09:33.290
It doesn't have to look like
we're the ones helping.

09:33.357 --> 09:35.659
What if another party was involved?

09:35.727 --> 09:38.095
Another party?

09:38.163 --> 09:39.864
Who in the galaxy
would be running around

09:39.931 --> 09:41.899
with an extra batch of missiles?

09:45.069 --> 09:46.370
Hondo.

09:55.582 --> 09:57.716
Is the Republic going to help us?

09:57.784 --> 09:59.352
No.

09:59.419 --> 10:01.521
What's it going to take?

10:01.589 --> 10:03.256
King Rash rules Onderon.

10:03.324 --> 10:06.660
Unless that changes,
the Republic can't do anything.

10:06.727 --> 10:08.728
They're pulling back.
Cover them.

10:22.242 --> 10:23.643
At this rate, the clankers

10:23.711 --> 10:25.178
aren't going to need reinforcements.

10:25.246 --> 10:27.247
We have to regroup at the nest.

10:27.315 --> 10:28.681
Yah!

10:59.012 --> 11:01.880
Skywalker, my old friend.

11:01.948 --> 11:03.681
You come alone?

11:03.749 --> 11:05.083
For your service.

11:05.150 --> 11:07.251
Oh, business!

11:07.319 --> 11:10.822
Good, good, good.
That I understand.

11:10.890 --> 11:13.324
I need you to make a delivery for me.

11:13.392 --> 11:17.562
And that all I am to you, Jedi?

11:17.630 --> 11:19.564
A delivery boy?

11:19.632 --> 11:22.434
I know that if I need arms
shipped illegally,

11:22.502 --> 11:24.302
you're the man I need to come to.

11:24.370 --> 11:26.738
Illegally?

11:26.806 --> 11:32.044
Now, why would a Jedi need
to deliver arms illegally?

11:32.112 --> 11:33.446
How about I pay you well enough

11:33.514 --> 11:35.048
that you just deliver
the missiles for me

11:35.115 --> 11:36.950
and don't ask any questions?

11:38.987 --> 11:42.522
Well, as long as you're not
paying me in credits,

11:42.590 --> 11:46.927
I'm sure I could accommodate
your wishes, Master Jedi.

11:53.567 --> 11:55.335
The highlands may slow down
the droids,

11:55.402 --> 11:57.270
but they won't stop the gunships.

11:57.338 --> 11:59.006
We have to move.

11:59.074 --> 12:01.042
Any word from Master Skywalker?

12:01.109 --> 12:02.576
Not yet.

12:05.247 --> 12:06.814
We're not giving up yet.

12:06.882 --> 12:08.716
Stagger our defenses to the camp.

12:08.784 --> 12:11.886
Secure the approach.
Stay in small teams.

12:11.954 --> 12:13.321
Make use of our training.

12:13.388 --> 12:16.123
You really are
the best leader among us.

12:16.191 --> 12:19.493
Couldn't be more proud
of you, my sister.

12:19.561 --> 12:22.830
I learned from the best, big brother.

12:22.898 --> 12:25.866
Let's go, General.

12:25.934 --> 12:27.268
You have to help us.

12:27.335 --> 12:29.570
I'll do all I can to protect you,

12:29.638 --> 12:34.074
but I can't fight this war for you.

12:34.142 --> 12:36.810
We wouldn't have made it
this far without you.

12:36.878 --> 12:38.678
I wish I could do more.

12:38.746 --> 12:40.213
Wait.

12:40.281 --> 12:42.948
Looks like we have company.

12:53.127 --> 12:54.127
Don't shoot!

13:02.871 --> 13:08.476
Well, you could be
my new favorite spice.

13:08.544 --> 13:10.445
Yeah, I don't think so.

13:10.512 --> 13:11.846
Careful, pirate.

13:11.914 --> 13:14.649
Hondo, what are you doing here?

13:14.717 --> 13:16.084
Oh, no, no, no.

13:16.151 --> 13:18.386
You should thank me, child.

13:18.453 --> 13:22.456
I have brought you a gift
from Skywalker and Kenobi.

13:22.523 --> 13:24.590
The latest from Sienar.

13:24.658 --> 13:25.858
Rocket launchers?

13:25.926 --> 13:29.262
Shoulder fired.
Very expensive.

13:29.329 --> 13:30.596
Paid for?

13:30.664 --> 13:32.532
Very handsome--

13:32.599 --> 13:34.967
Oh!
Oh, my, look at the time.

13:37.271 --> 13:40.507
Well, my work here is done.

13:58.323 --> 14:01.058
Ugh, they must have seen Hondo's ship.

14:01.126 --> 14:03.160
It was only a patrol.

14:03.228 --> 14:05.396
We have to get these
down to the others.

14:05.463 --> 14:06.630
Load them up.

14:06.698 --> 14:07.931
I hope they work.

14:07.999 --> 14:10.000
There's only one way to find out.

14:23.324 --> 14:24.034
We've tried everything,

14:24.172 --> 14:26.507
but we're target practice
for those gunships.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.342
Now it's their turn.

14:28.410 --> 14:29.610
Thank the Jedi.

14:32.180 --> 14:33.180
Saw!

14:43.558 --> 14:46.159
I love this!

14:50.498 --> 14:52.265
Distribute the rocket launchers

14:52.333 --> 14:54.167
and take out those gunships.

14:54.235 --> 14:56.069
Steela, they're attacking the nest.

14:56.137 --> 14:57.170
They're after the king!

14:57.238 --> 14:59.205
Come on!

15:04.878 --> 15:06.912
She sure leads by example.

15:06.980 --> 15:10.216
What good will that do us
if she gets herself killed?

15:21.130 --> 15:24.365
Steela, hurry!
Steela, come in!

15:24.433 --> 15:25.366
Ugh!

15:25.434 --> 15:28.203
Where is the false king?

15:28.271 --> 15:29.905
I'll never tell you!

15:29.973 --> 15:31.406
Ugh!

15:31.474 --> 15:33.909
Find the king.

15:51.861 --> 15:54.062
Help has arrived!

16:41.477 --> 16:43.912
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

16:43.979 --> 16:46.114
Thanks to you.

16:46.182 --> 16:50.317
Fire!

16:50.385 --> 16:52.386
Last one's mine.

16:58.127 --> 16:59.127
Get down!

17:15.377 --> 17:16.377
Look!

17:28.925 --> 17:32.294
Hang...on!

17:32.362 --> 17:37.133
Steela!

17:40.204 --> 17:41.171
Ah!

17:48.579 --> 17:50.614
I'll handle this.

17:54.018 --> 17:55.419
I got you.

18:39.828 --> 18:41.796
Your gunships have failed.

18:41.863 --> 18:44.065
I need more reinforcements.

18:44.133 --> 18:45.533
Really?

18:45.601 --> 18:49.071
General Kalani, what is your
assessment of the situation?

18:49.138 --> 18:51.640
They have managed
to penetrate our shields

18:51.708 --> 18:53.742
and are using the cover
of the highlands

18:53.810 --> 18:55.912
against our forces.

18:55.979 --> 18:59.616
To defeat them will take time.

18:59.683 --> 19:03.386
A prolonged war does not
interest me, General.

19:03.454 --> 19:07.691
Their rebellion grows
with every small victory.

19:07.758 --> 19:10.427
Then we are lost.

19:10.495 --> 19:13.530
Salvage the remaining arms
and withdraw the army.

19:13.598 --> 19:17.468
Bring them to Agamar.

19:17.535 --> 19:18.469
What about--

19:18.536 --> 19:19.536
Ugh!

19:29.614 --> 19:31.215
It was my fault.

19:31.283 --> 19:33.250
I shot that gunship down,

19:33.318 --> 19:36.053
and it crashed into her position.

19:36.121 --> 19:39.155
Saw, it's not your fault.

19:39.223 --> 19:41.257
She knew what the risks were.

19:41.325 --> 19:45.495
We all knew what it would take
to free Onderon.

20:29.707 --> 20:33.477
This has been quite a journey
for our Padawan.

20:33.544 --> 20:36.613
Steela will be a powerful
spirit in their lives.

20:36.681 --> 20:38.515
Yes.

20:38.583 --> 20:40.250
For all of us.

20:45.523 --> 20:47.591
I'm sorry for your loss.

20:49.528 --> 20:51.929
Thanks, but it's over now.

20:51.997 --> 20:53.998
Let's just leave it at that.

20:56.368 --> 20:58.169
Steela would be glad.

20:58.237 --> 21:02.140
Her sacrifice gave Onderon
its freedom.

21:02.208 --> 21:04.275
But at what cost?

21:04.343 --> 21:06.044
It's like you once said.

21:06.111 --> 21:07.345
Many lives get caught

21:07.413 --> 21:09.514
between the Republic
and the Separatists.

21:09.581 --> 21:12.650
I did say that once,
but after watching your heroics

21:12.718 --> 21:14.619
and the selflessness of the Jedi,

21:14.687 --> 21:18.189
I do believe the Republic
is the right side to be on.

21:18.257 --> 21:19.858
What do you mean?

21:19.926 --> 21:22.661
Dendup has appointed me
the new Senator of Onderon.

21:22.729 --> 21:24.997
I will follow
in my mother's footsteps,

21:25.065 --> 21:27.566
and I will bring us back
to the Republic.

21:27.634 --> 21:30.236
Remember this day,

21:30.304 --> 21:34.173
the day Onderon became free again.
