WEBVTT

00:08.091 --> 00:11.177
Crap. He knows we're here.
Howard, where the hell is backup?

00:11.261 --> 00:13.430
-Got eyes on Calvin.
-He's getting--

00:23.481 --> 00:24.315
Are you hurt?

00:25.233 --> 00:27.610
My ears are ringing.

00:28.778 --> 00:31.698
Doesn't look like
you were hit by the debris.

00:32.365 --> 00:33.199
Here.

00:33.992 --> 00:34.993
Easy.

00:56.681 --> 00:58.558
It's fine. Today's still gonna be great.

00:58.641 --> 01:02.520
No. Not if Todd's not there. I can't
believe he's gonna miss our baby shower.

01:02.604 --> 01:06.441
I'll be there. Come on, I'll fill in.
I'll do whatever you need.

01:06.524 --> 01:07.567
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:07.650 --> 01:09.194
We're supposed to get there early

01:09.277 --> 01:11.571
so we can make sure
everything is set up correctly.

01:11.654 --> 01:13.031
Just tell me what time.

01:13.114 --> 01:15.366
Todd was gonna take notes
for the thank-you cards

01:15.450 --> 01:17.160
and load everything into the car.

01:17.243 --> 01:18.787
Consider it done.

01:19.412 --> 01:24.209
Thank you. I mean-- Honestly, I can barely
even get in and out of a chair anymore.

01:24.292 --> 01:26.795
Whatever you need, I'm gonna be there.

01:26.878 --> 01:27.796
Thank you.

01:27.879 --> 01:28.838
Oh, hey, you.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.090
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:30.173 --> 01:32.884
Todd had to go off on a business trip,

01:32.967 --> 01:35.553
so Jack's offered
to help with the baby shower.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.806
Oh. I'm sorry that Todd can't be there.

01:37.889 --> 01:39.766
But we're gonna make it work.

01:39.849 --> 01:43.186
Yeah, thanks for talking me off the ledge.

01:43.269 --> 01:44.771
-You're welcome.
-I should go.

01:44.854 --> 01:47.148
I bought two dresses for today,

01:47.232 --> 01:51.444
and I have to figure out
which one I can squeeze into. So...

01:51.528 --> 01:53.238
-All right. Bye.
-Bye.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.367
So to what do I owe the honor?

01:57.450 --> 02:00.286
I'm on my way
to meet Mark's mom in Grace Valley.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.914
Oh. Sorry, I didn't realize
Cassandra was today.

02:02.997 --> 02:05.917
-It's the only time she had available.
-What's she up here for?

02:06.000 --> 02:08.044
She's got appointments in San Francisco.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.629
She flew in this morning.

02:09.712 --> 02:13.716
So between that and work, I'm gonna end up
being late for the shower.

02:13.800 --> 02:18.304
Don't worry about that. Just remember
what Doc said about limiting your stress.

02:18.805 --> 02:22.851
-Cassandra is not gonna make that easy.
-Why don't we talk in my office?

02:26.771 --> 02:29.399
Well, would it help if I go with you?

02:29.482 --> 02:31.609
Oh, no, no, that's fine.

02:32.610 --> 02:36.197
If she saw me with somebody else,
it would make things worse.

02:36.281 --> 02:39.033
What I still don't understand

02:39.117 --> 02:43.705
is how you as the surviving parent
wouldn't have full custody of the embryos.

02:43.788 --> 02:46.791
No, I do. That doesn't mean
she can't file a lawsuit.

02:46.875 --> 02:49.085
-You think she'd do that?
-She might.

02:49.752 --> 02:54.424
And if it's Mark's,
then she'll have rights.

02:55.049 --> 02:57.844
I feel like
I have to be prepared for the worst.

02:58.428 --> 03:02.015
We just gotta stay strong and have faith.
Isn't that what you tell me?

03:02.891 --> 03:04.392
-Yeah.
-Hey, look at me.

03:04.475 --> 03:06.978
-This therapy thing is doing something.

03:07.687 --> 03:10.481
-Seriously, I'm proud of you for going.
-Thanks.

03:11.274 --> 03:14.068
-When's your next appointment?
-Supposed to be this afternoon.

03:14.152 --> 03:16.696
I have to change it.
I gotta get Charmaine to the shower.

03:16.779 --> 03:18.990
Are you sure
that's a good idea to reschedule?

03:19.073 --> 03:21.951
I'm not trying to get out of it.
Gotta find a new time to do it.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.036
I'm not saying that.

03:23.119 --> 03:27.373
What I meant is consistency is important,
especially in the beginning.

03:27.457 --> 03:31.461
-Yeah, I'm giving it a go. Okay?
-I know. Which means a lot to me.

03:31.544 --> 03:32.837
-Good.
-It does.

03:33.630 --> 03:34.464
Good.

03:36.174 --> 03:37.508
And as far as Charmaine goes,

03:37.592 --> 03:42.555
if I can show her that things between her
and I don't have to be so contentious,

03:42.639 --> 03:45.475
we'll have one less custody issue
on our hands.

03:50.313 --> 03:52.941
-I'll be stealing your recipe.
-By all means.

03:53.524 --> 03:55.526
Hey, Denny made pancakes.

03:55.610 --> 03:59.822
-Oh. That's mighty nice. Thank you.
-I wanna make sure I'm earning my keep.

03:59.906 --> 04:03.618
Keep making these pancakes
and you can stay as long as you want.

04:04.118 --> 04:07.622
I'm gonna start cleaning up. I'm meeting
up with Lizzie to play Frisbee golf.

04:07.705 --> 04:10.083
Don't know what that is,
but enjoy yourself.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.000
Thanks.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.880
I wanna talk to you
about that center that I found.

04:16.297 --> 04:18.466
-Uh, could we talk about it later?
-Okay,

04:18.549 --> 04:20.969
-but let's not put it off for too long.
-Okay.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.805
-Look what I have.
-Oh, my.

04:24.639 --> 04:25.598
Bravo.

04:30.770 --> 04:34.565
I was thinking
we should do something together.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.402
-Wanna play some cards?
-We should try something new.

04:38.319 --> 04:40.405
We have been down that road,
it hasn't worked.

04:40.488 --> 04:44.284
So let's get creative.
We could go antiquing this weekend.

04:44.367 --> 04:47.745
Why don't you come fishing with me
and Bert? We're going to Maple River.

04:47.829 --> 04:50.456
-You--
-Please. Anything but that.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.960
Um, there's a craft fair in Eureka.

04:54.043 --> 04:56.546
I was thinking of taking up bird-watching.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.424
Why is this so difficult?

04:59.507 --> 05:03.720
Honey, a lot of couples
don't have anything in common,

05:03.803 --> 05:07.015
but if it's that important to you,
we'll figure it out.

05:14.105 --> 05:16.149
Hi, Barry. It's Jack Sheridan.

05:16.232 --> 05:20.862
Sorry for the short notice, but we're
gonna have to reschedule today's session.

05:21.779 --> 05:23.573
I know. I'm sorry about that.

05:25.491 --> 05:26.617
Yeah, that'll work.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.455
Okay, thanks for being flexible.
I'll see you tonight.

05:31.456 --> 05:33.166
-Okay. Come in.

05:35.376 --> 05:37.962
Okay, um, you're in trouble.

05:38.546 --> 05:41.466
-Oh, what did I do?
-I got off the phone with Mom,

05:41.549 --> 05:43.968
I may have mentioned
Charmaine's baby shower is today.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.511
Why would you do that?

05:45.595 --> 05:48.014
I'm sorry.
She caught me before I had my coffee.

05:48.097 --> 05:51.017
-What's the damage?
-She wants me to host a shower

05:51.100 --> 05:52.852
for the twins in Sacramento.

05:52.935 --> 05:56.522
-You don't have to do that.
-That's not gonna fly with her.

05:56.606 --> 06:00.193
Well, I'll tell her we'll do a reception
at the house after the twins are born.

06:00.777 --> 06:03.279
I will happily
let you deliver that message.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.864
-No problem.
-Okay.

06:04.947 --> 06:06.532
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

06:06.616 --> 06:10.620
Oh, and in a couple of weeks,
Brady and I are gonna help her move.

06:11.245 --> 06:13.414
You and Brady
seem to be taking a step forward.

06:14.040 --> 06:14.874
Hmm?

06:14.957 --> 06:18.795
-Well, introducing him to Mom?
-Oh, no. I didn't plan that.

06:18.878 --> 06:22.548
-He-- He just offered to help.
-Why didn't you ask me instead?

06:22.632 --> 06:25.843
-If this is you being anti-Brady...
-It's not.

06:25.927 --> 06:29.389
This is me
having an open mind like you requested.

06:29.472 --> 06:31.808
-Okay, thank you.
-Welcome.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.851
I might take you up on that.

06:33.935 --> 06:36.312
If you're there,
she'll be less focused on everything

06:36.396 --> 06:38.856
-I'm doing wrong with my life.
-She's not that bad.

06:39.565 --> 06:42.527
Last time I saw her,
she told me I looked well-fed.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.822
Oh, yeah. Laugh it up.

06:45.905 --> 06:49.742
Dad was just telling me that he's thinking
about coming up here for Thanksgiving.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.202
I'm gonna leave you with that.

06:51.285 --> 06:54.038
-Gotta go. Sorry. See you at the shower.
-No. Call him back.

07:17.145 --> 07:18.312
Brady.

07:20.731 --> 07:21.566
How did you--?

07:23.359 --> 07:26.988
-What are you doing here?
-I came to pay my condolences.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.907
Calvin is no longer with us.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.706
-I don't care about Calvin.
-Good.

07:38.374 --> 07:40.126
The shipment is almost here.

07:40.793 --> 07:45.298
Now that Calvin's gone, I'll need you
to play an active role in distribution.

07:45.381 --> 07:47.008
Look, I already told you...

07:49.010 --> 07:50.261
I don't handle the drugs.

07:50.344 --> 07:53.890
Well, if you're smart,
you'll fall in line.

07:54.807 --> 07:55.641
Calvin...

07:57.477 --> 07:58.603
wasn't smart.

08:15.411 --> 08:16.370
-Hey.
-Hey.

08:17.371 --> 08:18.498
How you holding up?

08:20.291 --> 08:21.125
I'm okay.

08:22.460 --> 08:25.880
-I was just talking to Jack.
-You didn't say anything about Calvin.

08:25.963 --> 08:28.049
Of course not.
He would freak out if he knew.

08:28.132 --> 08:30.092
The news never mentioned his name.

08:30.176 --> 08:34.055
-They still haven't found his body?
-You didn't tell Brady either.

08:34.138 --> 08:37.350
No. I'm worried if he knows,
he'll go into fight mode,

08:37.433 --> 08:39.352
and that feels more dangerous
than playing along.

08:39.435 --> 08:40.269
I agree.

08:41.646 --> 08:44.398
-Okay.
-You any closer to finding Melissa?

08:44.482 --> 08:49.904
Uh, no. San Diego address was a dead end,
so we'll keep on digging.

08:50.696 --> 08:53.199
Okay. I appreciate
everything you're doing.

08:53.282 --> 08:56.786
-I've put a lot of pressure on you.
-Don't worry about it.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.287
-Okay.
-Okay.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.455
-See you.
-See you.

09:16.931 --> 09:17.807
Cassandra.

09:17.890 --> 09:20.685
-Thanks for coming.
-Your timing was fortuitous.

09:21.269 --> 09:24.564
I'm only in San Francisco
four days out of the year.

09:24.647 --> 09:26.357
Oh, well, that is lucky.

09:27.191 --> 09:31.237
But I do have to get back to the city
by 2:00 for a cosmetic procedure.

09:31.862 --> 09:34.657
Dr. Foster demands punctuality.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.826
But he's worth it.

09:36.909 --> 09:39.120
Well, this shouldn't take very long.

09:39.203 --> 09:44.959
When I saw Stacie last week, she told me
something I can't really imagine is true.

09:45.585 --> 09:50.464
She said that you wanted
custody of Mark and my embryos?

09:50.548 --> 09:51.382
That's right.

09:53.551 --> 09:56.137
I just-- I don't understand.

09:57.513 --> 10:01.851
Melinda, Mark's passing
left an unbearable void in my life,

10:01.934 --> 10:07.356
and I had no idea how I would ever fill it
until I remembered those embryos.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.901
And for the first time since the accident,

10:10.985 --> 10:13.195
I felt this glimmer
of hope for the future.

10:13.279 --> 10:16.824
I could hire a surrogate
and Mark's legacy would live on.

10:16.907 --> 10:22.663
-You think that I would let that happen?
-No, which is why I've hired an attorney,

10:22.747 --> 10:25.875
who discovered through
a private investigator

10:25.958 --> 10:27.752
that you utilized the embryos.

10:29.712 --> 10:33.591
Wow. That is completely out of line,
even for you.

10:33.674 --> 10:36.385
And I'm right to assume
you're pregnant. Yes?

10:38.137 --> 10:39.221
Look, Cassandra...

10:40.222 --> 10:44.060
When Mark and I
started our fertility process,

10:44.602 --> 10:47.146
we signed over the rights
to each other in case something

10:47.229 --> 10:48.898
were to happen to one of us.

10:49.440 --> 10:54.236
So in our will it clearly states
that in the event of one of our deaths,

10:54.904 --> 10:58.866
the surviving spouse
would have full custody of the embryos

10:58.949 --> 11:00.785
and any subsequent child.

11:00.868 --> 11:03.621
You obviously
don't understand my situation.

11:05.122 --> 11:08.668
The pain of losing my only son
has been excruciating.

11:08.751 --> 11:11.587
Just because you're in pain
does not give you the right to come

11:11.671 --> 11:13.631
and try to take something
that is not yours.

11:14.507 --> 11:17.176
Mark's heir is my flesh and blood,

11:17.760 --> 11:21.681
I believe that child should be raised
at least half the time by me.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.849
I know that you miss him.

11:25.142 --> 11:27.436
Okay, I miss him too.
I know that you're angry.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.854
Of course I'm angry.

11:28.938 --> 11:35.403
Mark was my angel
and his death was a needless tragedy.

11:35.486 --> 11:37.279
I agree, and I was angry too.

11:38.447 --> 11:41.450
But at some point you have to decide

11:41.534 --> 11:44.120
whether or not you're gonna let
that anger eat away at you

11:44.203 --> 11:46.038
for the rest of your life or let it go.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.250
You need to accept that he's gone. Okay?

11:49.333 --> 11:53.212
And fighting me over this child,
it's not gonna bring him back.

11:54.922 --> 11:59.552
If you are pregnant, that's my grandchild.

12:01.011 --> 12:02.430
And I have rights.

12:09.812 --> 12:13.023
We're trying to get a warrant to trace
the phone that Christopher used.

12:13.107 --> 12:16.068
-But it's taking some time.
-Damn it.

12:16.152 --> 12:20.281
It's not all bad. A contact of mine
did some digging and found Sally.

12:21.073 --> 12:22.825
-Wow. Okay.
-Yeah.

12:22.908 --> 12:25.119
Well, did he say why she drugged me?

12:25.202 --> 12:29.206
She claims that Vince threatened
to kill her if she didn't help him.

12:29.290 --> 12:31.375
He thinks she knows where Vince is.

12:31.876 --> 12:34.587
-She's too scared to say anything.
-Now what?

12:34.670 --> 12:38.549
We could arrest her
for accessory to kidnapping, drugging you,

12:38.632 --> 12:41.635
try to get her to testify against Vince
in exchange for protection.

12:41.719 --> 12:45.514
-But that'll take time.
-Yeah, which we don't have.

12:45.598 --> 12:49.226
Better play is to let me make contact.

12:49.310 --> 12:52.980
Get her to a safe house,
have her lead us to Vince. Trust me.

12:53.063 --> 12:54.356
Oh, my God.

12:56.066 --> 12:57.860
-Man, this is torture.
-I know.

12:59.278 --> 13:00.112
I'm sorry.

13:01.071 --> 13:04.784
No. No, you know, it's not your fault.

13:04.867 --> 13:08.162
Just... Just let me know
if anything turns up.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.124
I'll let you know.

13:28.599 --> 13:32.728
So, how's it going with your grandson?
Bet that was a shocker, huh?

13:33.979 --> 13:35.272
You could say that.

13:37.358 --> 13:40.069
Actually, it's been
a bit of a roller coaster.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.738
He's still a kid.

13:42.822 --> 13:46.408
-He's been through some rough stuff.
-Glad he found you.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.246
-And how's Shirley feeling?
-Oh, she's okay.

13:51.288 --> 13:52.623
She's tough, you know?

13:53.332 --> 13:54.667
What about you?

13:54.750 --> 13:57.711
Her lupus diagnosis
must have affected both of you.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.463
The thing that gets me is...

14:02.007 --> 14:02.967
there's no cure.

14:05.135 --> 14:07.263
What are we even looking forward to?

14:07.346 --> 14:12.059
I think all we can do is live for today.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.687
There's so much we wanna do.

14:16.063 --> 14:19.149
You know, like, rent an RV
and go to the Grand Canyon.

14:19.233 --> 14:22.319
Well, do that.
No sense in waiting.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.405
Lupus is not a death sentence.

14:24.488 --> 14:25.573
I guess we could.

14:27.366 --> 14:30.244
The truth is, none of us knows
what tomorrow is gonna bring.

14:30.327 --> 14:32.955
I mean, maybe things will be better.

14:33.539 --> 14:34.915
Maybe they'll be worse.

14:36.292 --> 14:41.338
So, it's just up to us
to focus on the now.

14:42.882 --> 14:43.716
And be thankful.

15:16.665 --> 15:20.878
By the way, thanks for inviting me today.
Thought you might ghost me.

15:21.629 --> 15:24.715
-Why would I do that?
-I told Doc about the Klonopin.

15:26.550 --> 15:28.761
It's sweet you're protective of him.

15:29.595 --> 15:34.099
-Things are good between you guys?
-He's been super great. So understanding.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.603
Can I ask, if you use
that stuff for anxiety,

15:37.686 --> 15:40.439
why don't you go to the doctor
and get your own prescription?

15:40.522 --> 15:43.859
Don't tell Doc this,
but I hate going to the doctor's.

15:44.652 --> 15:47.071
And it's not like I need it all the time.

15:47.154 --> 15:50.157
Just sometimes, when I think about my dad.

15:50.824 --> 15:53.160
I'm so sorry. It's gotta be terrible.

15:54.244 --> 15:58.374
You know, if you ever want to vent,
I'm a really great listener.

15:59.083 --> 15:59.917
Thanks.

16:01.835 --> 16:03.796
Look, it's your disc. You're up.

16:11.637 --> 16:12.638
Hey!

16:13.806 --> 16:15.557
-So close.
-So close.

16:17.851 --> 16:18.811
-Hey!
-Hey!

16:18.894 --> 16:22.982
-What are you doing all the way over here?
-Uh, I was meeting with my mother-in-law.

16:23.899 --> 16:26.235
Mark's mother. What are you doing?

16:26.318 --> 16:29.488
I have a client meeting,
and this is the nicest place in town.

16:29.571 --> 16:31.281
Let's get back to you.

16:31.365 --> 16:33.283
-You guys keep in touch?
-Oh, no.

16:33.784 --> 16:35.703
No, she's not a big fan of mine.

16:35.786 --> 16:37.579
Why'd you guys get together?

16:37.663 --> 16:39.665
She wants something from me,

16:39.748 --> 16:42.084
and she's threatening
to take legal action to get it.

16:42.167 --> 16:44.878
Do you have any paperwork
specifying ownership?

16:44.962 --> 16:47.589
Oh, yeah. Yeah, and she knows that.

16:47.673 --> 16:50.300
-I take it she plans to sue.
-Yeah.

16:51.301 --> 16:54.054
It's amazing to me
that somebody can come in

16:54.138 --> 16:56.181
and try to take something
that doesn't belong to them.

16:56.265 --> 17:01.395
-In the legal world, happens all the time.
-What she wants is non-negotiable.

17:01.478 --> 17:05.149
Okay. Well, before you hire an attorney,
I would be happy to vet them for you.

17:05.232 --> 17:06.442
That would be great.

17:07.443 --> 17:08.777
-Thanks.
-Of course.

17:08.861 --> 17:13.657
-I got to get back to the clinic.
-Okay. Well, I will see you at the shower.

17:15.826 --> 17:18.537
-Yeah, it'll be great. Bye.
-See you.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.417
You're saying the house
in Eureka is even bigger?

17:23.500 --> 17:26.378
It's like twice the size.
You should come see it.

17:27.004 --> 17:29.381
-Oh, my God.
-What?

17:29.923 --> 17:32.092
What if the caterer forgot
to pick up the cake?

17:32.176 --> 17:34.011
Didn't you say there's
a whole dessert bar?

17:34.094 --> 17:37.890
Yeah. I just--
I want everything to be perfect.

17:37.973 --> 17:40.476
I get that, but it's a party.
Try to enjoy it.

17:41.143 --> 17:44.480
Thanks for coming early.
I hope I didn't mess up your schedule.

17:44.563 --> 17:46.982
I said I would be there for you,
and I meant it.

17:48.108 --> 17:49.777
You're gonna be a great dad.

17:49.860 --> 17:53.822
-That's nice of you to say.
-Well, I can be nice.

17:55.032 --> 17:56.408
What about you and Mel?

17:56.492 --> 17:58.911
Have you guys talked about having kids?

17:59.953 --> 18:03.832
-What?
-You're gonna get married at some point,

18:03.916 --> 18:06.460
and she does seem like the mom type.

18:07.628 --> 18:10.964
Uh, you know, I haven't really
given it much thought.

18:11.465 --> 18:12.299
You're lying.

18:12.382 --> 18:15.010
-Hmm?
-Your nostrils, they flare when you lie.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.888
-No, they don't.
-Yeah, they do. It's happening.

18:17.971 --> 18:20.057
Okay, fine. It's crossed my mind.

18:20.182 --> 18:24.436
-That's all I'm gonna say on the matter.
-Hey, was that so hard to share?

18:24.937 --> 18:27.564
I don't know why you keep
everything bottled up.

18:27.648 --> 18:29.066
It's the way I'm wired, I guess.

18:29.566 --> 18:34.905
You should be shouting from the rooftops
because you found the woman

18:34.988 --> 18:37.574
you want to spend
the rest of your life with. It's a gift.

18:37.658 --> 18:41.286
I didn't think I'd get married again,
let alone have a bunch of kids.

18:41.370 --> 18:45.666
Yeah, my aunt says that the universe
has a really twisted sense of humor.

18:45.749 --> 18:47.626
Oh, I think she was right.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.551
-Thank you for coming over.
-You said it was an emergency.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.010
I'm working with a deadline.

18:57.511 --> 18:59.429
I was wondering if you would teach me

18:59.513 --> 19:02.182
how to play before Vernon
gets home from fishing.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.727
You want me to teach you
how to play backgammon?

19:05.811 --> 19:06.645
You're right.

19:07.187 --> 19:09.314
When you say it out loud,
it sounds ridiculous.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.108
-You're free to go.
-No, no!

19:11.191 --> 19:12.734
No, seriously, wait. I--

19:13.652 --> 19:15.988
It would be a privilege
for me to teach you.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.283
But it really isn't an emergency.

19:22.286 --> 19:24.371
Hi, my name is Mel Monroe.

19:24.454 --> 19:26.582
I'd like to schedule a consultation.

19:27.791 --> 19:28.876
Mornings are fine.

19:30.919 --> 19:32.754
Uh, I'm about eight weeks pregnant,

19:32.838 --> 19:37.426
and there might be an issue
with the grandmother.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.267
Sorry, I did not hear you come in.

19:45.350 --> 19:49.730
I just came here to tell you that
Mrs. Douglas is here for her appointment.

19:49.813 --> 19:51.773
All right, great. Um...

19:52.649 --> 19:54.318
You did just walk in, right?

19:54.401 --> 19:57.070
-You weren't...
-I should have knocked. Sorry.

19:57.154 --> 19:59.364
Oh, no problem. Thanks.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.085
Thanks, buddy.

20:13.670 --> 20:15.047
-Yeah, I got you.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.716
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

20:17.799 --> 20:19.801
Oh, it's a long way down. Okay.

20:20.385 --> 20:21.220
Thanks.

20:22.554 --> 20:25.307
-Oh, it's so nice.
-Nice. Fancy.

20:26.808 --> 20:28.185
Hey, I gotta take this.

20:28.268 --> 20:30.687
-Okay, don't take too long.
-I'll be back.

20:32.981 --> 20:33.941
Mike. What's up?

20:34.024 --> 20:36.026
Forensics came back on the knife

20:36.109 --> 20:38.528
that Preacher found wedged
under the sink at the bar.

20:38.612 --> 20:39.821
Okay. Um...

20:40.489 --> 20:41.823
He didn't mention a knife.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.868
Yeah. I told him not to say anything
in case it was a dud.

20:44.952 --> 20:45.786
And it's not?

20:46.954 --> 20:48.538
<i>DNA matches Vince.</i>

20:50.540 --> 20:51.583
Wow.

20:51.667 --> 20:55.629
All right, well, that makes the DA's case
against Brady pretty weak.

20:55.712 --> 20:59.841
It's not a lock, but the DA's
not gonna give up just yet.

20:59.925 --> 21:04.221
Come on! There's proof that Vince
was there and my memory was accurate.

21:04.304 --> 21:07.474
But Brady was there too,
and he was the one with the gun.

21:08.141 --> 21:11.019
-Jack, I need a hand with the flowers.
-Uh, yeah.

21:11.103 --> 21:14.815
Listen, Mike. I gotta go,
but I'll call you later. All right.

21:20.529 --> 21:21.446
That's illegal.

21:26.702 --> 21:29.246
-So is that.
-So what can I do?

21:30.080 --> 21:33.333
In backgammon, all the pieces
have to go in one direction.

21:33.417 --> 21:38.547
So you would start in the opponent,
which is me-- the opponent's inner table.

21:38.630 --> 21:41.133
Go through the opponent's outer table.

21:41.216 --> 21:43.719
Then you'll come through
the player's outer table

21:43.802 --> 21:46.471
and finish in the player's inner table.

21:46.555 --> 21:49.349
Even before the accident,
I wouldn't have remembered all that.

21:49.433 --> 21:52.227
It just takes practice and some patience.

21:52.311 --> 21:55.147
Patience and me don't get along.

21:55.856 --> 21:59.151
Vernon and I will just
have to lead separate lives.

21:59.234 --> 22:00.068
Okay.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.738
What's really going on here?

22:03.530 --> 22:06.366
-If I tell you, you'll make fun of me.
-I would never do that.

22:07.409 --> 22:12.039
Fine, I will promise you that in
this instance, I will not make fun of you.

22:13.999 --> 22:14.833
Well...

22:16.793 --> 22:18.712
I was in the community garden...

22:20.630 --> 22:21.715
and it was like...

22:23.759 --> 22:25.969
Lilly was there talking to me.

22:27.929 --> 22:29.931
Anyway, I'm obviously missing her,

22:30.015 --> 22:33.977
and I thought if Vernon and I
could find more things to do together,

22:34.061 --> 22:36.938
-I'd feel less lonely.
-Hence the backgammon?

22:37.439 --> 22:42.819
Correct. However, the experiment failed,
but I appreciate you trying.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.364
No, I'll tell you what.

22:46.198 --> 22:49.076
I'm gonna make you a cheat sheet. Okay?

22:49.159 --> 22:52.454
And that way, you don't have
to remember everything all at once.

22:52.537 --> 22:54.247
Why are you being so helpful?

22:54.331 --> 22:58.251
Because you are my friend.
And I wanna see my friends happy.

23:05.050 --> 23:05.884
Catch something?

23:09.054 --> 23:09.888
Just rub it in.

24:07.404 --> 24:08.238
Thanks.

24:12.033 --> 24:14.327
-Hey.
-Hey. Oh.

24:14.786 --> 24:17.747
-Nice.
-Are we really playing "Baby Bingo"?

24:17.831 --> 24:20.083
I don't know.
I'm not in charge. I just work here.

24:20.667 --> 24:21.918
-Hey, Brie.
-Hey.

24:22.002 --> 24:25.338
Jack, there's a bunch of presents
out front. Can you bring them in for me?

24:25.422 --> 24:27.299
-Sure.
-Thanks. And where's your drink?

24:27.382 --> 24:28.592
Oh, I just got here.

24:28.675 --> 24:32.512
Oh, well, I don't mean to brag,
but the champagne is Dom,

24:32.596 --> 24:34.431
so I can't have any.

24:34.514 --> 24:35.807
-You should indulge.
-Okay.

24:35.891 --> 24:37.309
Okay. Hi!

24:37.392 --> 24:38.685
She's a lot.

24:38.768 --> 24:41.062
She's just excited. I'll be back.

24:43.064 --> 24:43.982
Yes. Thank you.

24:50.655 --> 24:52.199
-Hi.
-Hey.

24:53.783 --> 24:57.287
-So, what do you think about all this?
-It's a lot.

24:58.413 --> 25:00.457
-That's what I just said.
-Yeah, I bet.

25:01.583 --> 25:04.002
How much do you think
she paid for those centerpieces?

25:04.085 --> 25:05.754
I don't know, but they are gorgeous.

25:05.837 --> 25:08.381
Oh, come on,
don't be so nice. Dish with me.

25:08.965 --> 25:10.467
Okay. I mean, the oysters

25:10.550 --> 25:13.303
-are way over the top for a baby shower.
-Yeah.

25:14.429 --> 25:17.140
But, to be honest, I can't wait
to get my hands on that cake.

25:17.224 --> 25:18.517
Oh, yeah, that's happening.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.353
-Oh, sorry, this might be work.

25:22.145 --> 25:24.022
-Yeah. Hold on one sec.
-Sure.

25:30.737 --> 25:32.572
-Hello?
-<i>Hey, beautiful.</i>

25:33.990 --> 25:38.578
<i>So I've got good news. I'm up for partner,</i>
<i>but I need you to vouch for me.</i>

25:38.662 --> 25:42.999
<i>Stella told HR that I washarassingher,</i>
<i>which is a flat-outlie.</i>

25:43.875 --> 25:45.252
You want me to do what?

25:45.919 --> 25:49.256
<i>Just call Phil</i>
<i>and tell him I wasn't the reason you left.</i>

25:51.508 --> 25:53.426
I-- I did leave because of you.

25:54.177 --> 25:56.513
<i>Whatever you think</i>
<i>happened between us didn't.</i>

25:56.596 --> 26:00.600
<i>There's some rumors going aroundaboutme</i>
<i>that I can't seem to shake,</i>

26:00.684 --> 26:03.103
<i>so I need you to set the record straight.</i>

26:08.358 --> 26:10.610
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, what's wrong?

26:11.778 --> 26:12.696
That was Don.

26:13.572 --> 26:16.283
What? Oh, my God, honey. Let's go outside.

26:20.620 --> 26:22.914
-See, you're getting it.
-I'm losing.

26:22.998 --> 26:24.624
The game isn't over yet.

26:24.708 --> 26:28.670
-Must you debate everything I say?
-That is not what I'm doing here.

26:28.753 --> 26:30.213
-Case in point!
-Fine.

26:31.047 --> 26:33.508
No more bickering. And that reminds me.

26:34.551 --> 26:37.178
Have you noticed anything off
between Nick and Jo Ellen?

26:37.262 --> 26:38.096
No.

26:39.014 --> 26:42.017
-Huh. I'm not one to gossip.
-Uh-huh.

26:42.100 --> 26:43.268
Do you wanna hear this or not?

26:43.351 --> 26:44.728
Yes, spit it out.

26:44.811 --> 26:48.607
Apparently, they got into some kind
of an argument at Joey's wedding.

26:48.690 --> 26:51.985
-You didn't see them?
-No, but it's probably nothing.

26:52.068 --> 26:54.946
Married couples fight all the time.
Just ask Vernon.

26:55.030 --> 26:56.531
That's true.

26:58.241 --> 27:00.869
You know, this--
This has been really nice.

27:02.203 --> 27:07.125
You and I aren't the best of friends,
but if you are ever feeling lonely,

27:07.208 --> 27:09.919
please know
you're so welcome to come over.

27:10.003 --> 27:11.671
That's kind of you to offer.

27:12.380 --> 27:14.382
I know what loneliness feels like.

27:15.383 --> 27:19.888
And it's not the being alone that hurts.
It's feeling like no one cares.

27:19.971 --> 27:22.307
And I'm here to tell you that I care.

27:24.559 --> 27:25.477
I care too.

27:27.687 --> 27:28.647
Okay.

27:28.730 --> 27:31.149
-Oh!

27:31.232 --> 27:32.108
No.

27:34.194 --> 27:36.279
I cannot believe I beat you.

27:36.363 --> 27:37.489
By one stroke.

27:37.572 --> 27:42.202
-And I let you cheat multiple times.
-You have no idea what you're up against.

27:42.285 --> 27:44.579
I can be persistent when I wanna be.

27:48.375 --> 27:50.043
Think I should order a taxi?

27:51.252 --> 27:53.963
No, Jack's driving us
to the bus station. Remember?

27:54.589 --> 27:55.840
Yes, yes. That's right.

27:55.924 --> 27:58.510
It's hard to believe
that you'll be leaving in a few days.

27:59.052 --> 28:02.639
Seems like just yesterday
you were running around in diapers.

28:06.393 --> 28:07.560
You were so cute.

28:08.561 --> 28:12.232
You had these little curls,
your mother never cut your hair.

28:12.315 --> 28:16.486
So truth be told,
most people thought you were a girl.

28:19.489 --> 28:21.282
Ricky, is your food okay?

28:22.325 --> 28:25.078
Oh, um, yeah, sorry.

28:28.581 --> 28:31.793
I know how hard it is
to lose someone you love.

28:31.876 --> 28:34.337
Are you talking about Pop-Pop?

28:34.421 --> 28:36.047
I meant your Lizzie.

28:37.132 --> 28:40.468
But, yes, he was the love of my life.

28:41.136 --> 28:44.764
We were about your age when we met.
You remind me of him.

28:46.641 --> 28:49.602
-Really?
-Oh, yes, and that's quite the compliment.

28:49.686 --> 28:53.857
I wish he had lived to see you
grow into the person that you've become.

28:53.940 --> 28:57.110
Just like me, he would be so proud of you.

29:00.488 --> 29:01.448
Thanks, Grandma.

29:04.075 --> 29:07.287
I owe everything to you,
everything you've done for me.

29:07.996 --> 29:11.958
If it wasn't for you, I-- I don't know
what would've happened to me.

29:12.041 --> 29:14.252
You have family in Virgin River.

29:14.794 --> 29:17.881
There's Jack and Preacher.

29:19.257 --> 29:21.509
Doc and Hope and Mel.

29:23.261 --> 29:25.346
They all care about you.

29:26.055 --> 29:30.226
So, remember,
if you ever find yourself in need,

29:30.310 --> 29:32.979
you'll always have a home here.

29:38.526 --> 29:40.028
-Ooh.

29:41.237 --> 29:42.071
Hey.

29:43.990 --> 29:45.784
Not a nibble.

29:45.867 --> 29:47.452
Aw. Sad.

29:52.081 --> 29:53.583
What is this?

29:55.126 --> 29:57.045
-Did you set up this board?
-Yep.

29:57.837 --> 30:01.674
Hope, you've never ever played backgammon.

30:01.758 --> 30:04.552
I asked Muriel to teach me.
I wanted to surprise you.

30:04.636 --> 30:08.264
Well, the surprising thing
is that you asked Muriel for anything.

30:08.348 --> 30:13.394
Well, I lost my best friend,
and I've been feeling untethered.

30:15.313 --> 30:16.272
Of course.

30:17.941 --> 30:22.070
Someone who made a huge impact
on your life is gone.

30:22.946 --> 30:25.657
And that kind of loss is profound.

30:25.740 --> 30:26.574
It has been.

30:27.784 --> 30:29.577
But you've been so supportive,

30:30.703 --> 30:34.707
and I guess I'm hoping you and I
can find more things to do together.

30:37.210 --> 30:38.586
I would like that too.

30:40.296 --> 30:42.340
I love you so much, Vernon.

30:43.508 --> 30:44.759
I hope you know that.

30:44.843 --> 30:45.760
Oh, I do.

30:48.930 --> 30:49.764
I love you.

30:52.725 --> 30:55.770
And you did a good job
setting up the board.

30:55.854 --> 30:58.648
Good. Oh, I had to use
the cheat sheet Muriel made for me.

30:58.731 --> 31:00.316
You did all right.

31:01.526 --> 31:05.697
No, I'll answer that.
You decide which color you wanna be.

31:05.780 --> 31:06.614
I've decided.

31:10.368 --> 31:11.202
Hello.

31:12.287 --> 31:13.121
This is he.

31:15.456 --> 31:16.416
Uh-huh.

31:17.792 --> 31:19.085
Oh, I understand.

31:20.712 --> 31:23.631
Um, I'm in the middle
of something right now.

31:23.715 --> 31:26.259
I'll have to call you back. Bye.

31:27.844 --> 31:28.678
Who was that?

31:28.761 --> 31:30.930
That was our insurance agent,

31:31.514 --> 31:35.852
and we are being sued by the man
Mrs. McCrea hit with her vehicle.

31:42.191 --> 31:44.110
Looks like you're gonna get it all to fit.

31:44.193 --> 31:47.196
Oh, when it comes to packing a truck,
I have never failed.

31:47.280 --> 31:50.116
If only it could just
magically unpack itself.

31:50.199 --> 31:53.286
When we get to the house, I'll
bring it in. You can put your feet up.

31:53.786 --> 31:54.787
Thanks.

31:55.330 --> 31:57.332
Did you hear from Todd?

31:58.917 --> 31:59.792
Nope.

32:00.793 --> 32:02.629
I'm sure he's in a meeting or something.

32:02.712 --> 32:04.130
You were great today.

32:04.213 --> 32:09.594
Thank you for taking notes while
I opened gifts and emceeing Baby Bingo.

32:09.677 --> 32:11.512
Yeah, it was outside my comfort zone,

32:11.596 --> 32:13.723
-that one, but--
-Yeah, it was. Yeah.

32:13.806 --> 32:16.392
-Glad you got to enjoy it.
-I did. Yeah.

32:17.977 --> 32:18.937
Um...

32:21.397 --> 32:22.231
What?

32:23.358 --> 32:24.609
I just-- I feel bad.

32:26.402 --> 32:28.029
-Because...
-You're such a good guy.

32:28.112 --> 32:31.991
And I want you to know that I will never
get in the way of you seeing the twins.

32:32.742 --> 32:35.828
You can spend
as much time with them as you want.

32:35.912 --> 32:37.538
Wow. Um...

32:38.623 --> 32:41.584
-Thank you. I'm glad to hear that.
-Yeah. Of course.

32:41.668 --> 32:44.253
-But what about Todd?
-He's not going to fight me on it.

32:44.337 --> 32:48.049
I don't think Todd cares
as much as he says he does.

32:48.132 --> 32:50.009
-That's pretty sad.
-Well...

32:51.219 --> 32:53.471
Like he said, you're the dad.

32:56.641 --> 32:57.475
That's right.

33:20.498 --> 33:22.041
Hey, they took out Calvin.

33:23.710 --> 33:24.544
Babe.

33:25.586 --> 33:26.421
What's wrong?

33:31.467 --> 33:33.011
Did something happen?

33:34.303 --> 33:35.138
Are you hurt?

33:36.889 --> 33:39.559
-Did someone threaten you?
-No, not like that.

33:45.815 --> 33:46.649
Hey.

33:47.400 --> 33:51.195
I wanna help,
but I can't if I don't know what's wrong.

33:57.535 --> 34:00.079
But if you don't wanna tell me,
that's okay.

34:00.997 --> 34:01.831
We can...

34:03.374 --> 34:05.001
It's okay. We can just sit here.

34:08.838 --> 34:10.757
I can't say it out loud.

34:10.840 --> 34:13.176
Hey. Hey, I understand.

34:14.802 --> 34:16.345
When I first got back from Iraq,

34:17.096 --> 34:22.101
there were some nights
where I was in my head, and it was--

34:22.185 --> 34:23.227
It was bad.

34:24.729 --> 34:26.314
I couldn't talk about it.

34:27.398 --> 34:28.357
So I just...

34:30.193 --> 34:31.819
started writing stuff down.

34:32.445 --> 34:33.488
Did it work?

34:35.740 --> 34:36.574
Yeah.

34:37.992 --> 34:41.079
I mean, you can have someone read it,
you can throw it away.

34:42.580 --> 34:44.123
Whatever you decide.

34:46.334 --> 34:48.044
And you still get the poison out.

34:51.881 --> 34:55.134
-Will you stay with me tonight?
-I'm not going anywhere.

34:57.595 --> 34:58.429
Hey.

35:09.607 --> 35:12.985
Hey, took one of these for you.

35:13.069 --> 35:14.570
Aw. That's sweet. Thank you.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.492
Hey, it was really nice
what you did today for Charmaine.

35:19.575 --> 35:22.954
Oh, she was pretty bummed about Todd,
so did what I could.

35:23.037 --> 35:25.039
Well, I could tell
she really appreciated it.

35:25.623 --> 35:26.457
Good.

35:26.541 --> 35:27.667
Come and sit with me.

35:28.251 --> 35:29.669
-My pleasure.

35:32.130 --> 35:34.048
-Hey.
-Oh, come here.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.758
Come here, you.

35:42.598 --> 35:43.850
What you thinking about?

35:45.768 --> 35:49.480
I'm just wondering
how much more of this we can take.

35:50.773 --> 35:51.899
You mean Cassandra?

35:52.650 --> 35:57.196
When I think about all the time and energy
it's gonna take for us to fight her

35:58.114 --> 36:00.992
with a newborn and twins and our jobs...

36:02.493 --> 36:04.704
I mean, God, it's just so overwhelming.

36:04.787 --> 36:05.663
Mm.

36:07.290 --> 36:09.667
I don't know how
we're gonna juggle it all, honestly.

36:12.587 --> 36:13.421
Well...

36:16.174 --> 36:17.967
we can just take it one day at a time.

36:18.801 --> 36:20.094
That's all we can do, right?

36:22.263 --> 36:23.097
Yeah.

36:26.392 --> 36:29.145
And I will do anything I can...

36:30.938 --> 36:32.607
to make things easier for you.

36:36.152 --> 36:37.361
Including the NIPP.

36:41.449 --> 36:43.993
-What?
-I wanna put your mind at ease, okay?

36:44.076 --> 36:47.955
And if it gets Cassandra out of our lives,
then all the better.

36:48.039 --> 36:51.792
-I don't wanna guilt you into this.
-It's got nothing to do with guilt.

36:52.418 --> 36:53.753
What if you regret it?

36:53.836 --> 36:54.670
I won't.

36:55.588 --> 36:57.924
No, this is my decision. I'm a big boy.

36:58.007 --> 37:00.760
I take full responsibility
for any repercussions.

37:03.012 --> 37:05.348
Hey, I'm gonna love our baby
no matter what.

37:06.557 --> 37:07.391
You sure?

37:07.475 --> 37:10.603
Yeah, it's gonna be half you.
How could I not?

37:13.397 --> 37:14.899
Well, okay.

37:17.360 --> 37:18.361
I love you.

37:19.904 --> 37:20.905
I love you.

38:20.715 --> 38:23.342
-How did you feel after the last session?
-Felt fine.

38:24.176 --> 38:25.720
And today was a good day.

38:25.803 --> 38:28.514
So I don't really feel
like there's much to talk about.

38:28.597 --> 38:30.224
-How was the shower?
-It was good.

38:30.308 --> 38:34.437
Yeah, Charmaine's husband wasn't there,
so it was the first time

38:34.520 --> 38:37.982
I actually felt
like I was part of the pregnancy.

38:38.858 --> 38:41.986
Sounds like you and Charmaine
are starting to make some strides.

38:42.069 --> 38:45.823
It's important that our relationship
is civil for the sake of the twins.

38:45.906 --> 38:49.327
I never want the boys to feel
like they gotta choose a side, you know?

38:51.120 --> 38:54.707
I'm still pretty freaked out
about having twins,

38:54.790 --> 38:58.419
so I'm just grateful
that they'll have each other's backs.

38:58.502 --> 39:01.881
On your intake form,
you said you have an older brother.

39:03.591 --> 39:05.676
What's your relationship like with him?

39:11.223 --> 39:12.099
Uh...

39:12.850 --> 39:14.352
Well, he, um...

39:17.897 --> 39:18.856
He died...

39:20.608 --> 39:21.567
when we were kids.

39:27.740 --> 39:29.408
I could get used to this.

39:33.329 --> 39:36.040
-What?
-You are so beautiful.

39:38.459 --> 39:40.252
How many glasses have you had?

39:40.336 --> 39:42.588
No, really. I thought the same thing

39:42.671 --> 39:45.966
the first time I saw you
at the aikido dojo.

39:46.050 --> 39:49.887
Well, I thought you were taken. I still
can't figure out why you're single.

39:49.970 --> 39:54.225
Well, I guess
it's just not easy for me to open up.

39:55.643 --> 39:59.814
Well, what about
with that other woman, Paige?

40:01.357 --> 40:02.525
How were you with her?

40:05.903 --> 40:07.238
I'd say that...

40:09.115 --> 40:10.074
I was guarded.

40:12.410 --> 40:16.580
She has a son, and I just wanted
to make sure I wasn't messing anything up.

40:18.374 --> 40:21.001
And why did you decide
to spend time with me?

40:22.044 --> 40:23.045
Well...

40:26.006 --> 40:29.593
in addition to you being smart...

40:30.886 --> 40:32.346
easy on the eyes...

40:32.430 --> 40:33.305
Thank you.

40:35.307 --> 40:39.061
You know, when Paige left,
I realized what I was missing.

40:40.896 --> 40:42.398
Someone to share my life with.

40:42.481 --> 40:47.486
And I saw you,
and something told me to take a shot.

40:50.489 --> 40:53.576
Well, I am glad that you did.

40:53.659 --> 40:54.702
So am I.

41:07.590 --> 41:08.424
We're closed.

41:09.258 --> 41:10.759
Come back tomorrow.

41:16.265 --> 41:17.850
Yeah. Sorry.

41:21.604 --> 41:23.689
All right.

41:23.772 --> 41:27.193
-Yep. I said that we are--

41:28.611 --> 41:29.862
Hi, Preacher.
