00:17.000 --> 00:18.367
- Ulch...
I'm not even kidding

00:18.467 --> 00:19.876
I don't think I've
ever been this hungry.

00:19.900 --> 00:21.060
- I know, me too.
- Let's eat!

00:21.100 --> 00:23.433
- Hey... hey...
Fooders is closed.

00:23.533 --> 00:25.267
- Come on!
- What are you talking about?

00:25.367 --> 00:28.133
- Sorry, we won't be open
again 'til next week.

00:28.233 --> 00:29.267
- Whyyyyy???

00:29.367 --> 00:31.700
- We're remodeling
the bathrooms.

00:31.800 --> 00:34.033
- Bathrooms?
- Yeah,

00:34.133 --> 00:37.000
we're putting
in flushable toilets.

00:37.100 --> 00:38.433
- Oh, okay.
- That's a good thing.

00:38.533 --> 00:41.233
- I can understand that.

00:41.333 --> 00:42.867
- So, now what?

00:42.967 --> 00:45.267
- We can't wait a week
to eat food.

00:48.833 --> 00:50.167
- Hey, I heard
about a coffee shop

00:50.267 --> 00:51.947
that's supposed to have
pretty decent food.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.700
It's called uh...
"I'll Be There For Brew."

00:53.800 --> 00:56.467
- Oh! Oh yeah,
I've heard of that place.

00:56.567 --> 00:58.509
- Uh-huh, I think it was
popular back in the nineties.

00:58.533 --> 00:59.709
- That's right.
- Yeah, I think it was.

00:59.733 --> 01:01.200
- So, should we go there?

01:04.200 --> 01:05.533
- Yeah, let's go
there right now.

01:05.633 --> 01:07.667
- We're out.
- Let's rush.

01:16.167 --> 01:17.833
- Looks like a decent place.

01:17.933 --> 01:19.567
- Yeah, nice coffee shop.

01:19.667 --> 01:21.200
- With a couch.

01:21.300 --> 01:23.900
You don't see that every day.

01:24.067 --> 01:26.767
- Oh...
Hey, 'scuze me...

01:26.867 --> 01:28.100
- Whatcha need?

01:28.200 --> 01:29.809
- Um, I was wondering
if me and my friends

01:29.833 --> 01:31.267
could sit in that area
over there.

01:31.367 --> 01:33.800
- Well...
I was sorta holding it,

01:33.900 --> 01:36.233
for some regular customers...

01:36.333 --> 01:37.943
But they haven't been in here
for like twelve years,

01:37.967 --> 01:39.600
so... sure.

01:39.700 --> 01:40.933
- Cool, thanks.

01:41.067 --> 01:42.433
- Hey, can we get some coffee?

01:42.533 --> 01:44.533
- Oh, and various muffins?

01:44.633 --> 01:46.533
- Sure.
Ask the waitress.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.767
- Where's the waitress?

01:50.867 --> 01:53.467
- She quit this morning.

01:53.567 --> 01:54.967
Any of you guys want a job?

01:55.067 --> 01:56.233
- Nope.
- Just coffee.

01:56.333 --> 01:58.167
- Got a job.
- I'm Hudson.

01:58.267 --> 01:59.787
- All right. I'll bring
you some coffee

01:59.833 --> 02:01.300
and various muffins in a few
minutes.

02:01.400 --> 02:03.067
- Thank you!

02:05.933 --> 02:07.900
- Ahh... Here we go.

02:08.067 --> 02:09.600
- This is nice.

02:09.700 --> 02:11.067
- Haha...
Gotta love a couch.

02:11.133 --> 02:12.333
- Some call it a sofa.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.567
- Oh hey!
Keep checking The Buzz Pit!

02:14.667 --> 02:17.067
- I am, but I need
the WiFi password here.

02:17.133 --> 02:20.900
- Man, you girls are obsessed
with checkin'

02:21.067 --> 02:22.443
that Buzz Pit website.
- Well, yeah.

02:22.467 --> 02:24.109
If they wrote a big
article about you and Hudson,

02:24.133 --> 02:26.333
wouldn't you guys be
all psyched about it?

02:26.433 --> 02:28.167
- Eh.
Nothin' much excites me.

02:28.267 --> 02:30.600
- Okay...
here's your coffee.

02:30.700 --> 02:33.633
- Whoaaaa!
It's in a bowl!

02:33.733 --> 02:38.167
- Yeah.

02:38.267 --> 02:41.467
- Hey, what's the WiFi
password here?

02:41.567 --> 02:44.467

flirtin' with me.

02:59.400 --> 03:00.833
- Nah nah nah.

03:00.933 --> 03:03.667
I'm pretty sure she's
flirting with me.

03:03.767 --> 03:06.067
- And what makes you think
it's you and not me?

03:06.100 --> 03:07.367

03:23.300 --> 03:25.900
The one in the hat?

03:26.067 --> 03:26.900

03:40.200 --> 03:44.233

You're so cute I could die.

03:44.333 --> 03:46.733

Ah, get some personal space...

breath on my neck.

04:02.767 --> 04:04.433

04:07.533 --> 04:09.500

life was gonna be this way.

08:12.333 --> 08:14.100
It's all about what
a genius you are.

08:27.700 --> 08:29.600
- Y'know, you're really
overreacting here.

08:29.700 --> 08:32.133
- No, you just think you're
sooo much more important

08:32.233 --> 08:34.633

with all our game ideas,

08:34.733 --> 08:38.533

You and me.

08:57.567 --> 08:58.833
- Wait, what are you saying?

08:58.933 --> 09:01.267
- I'm saying that
we go to school together

09:01.367 --> 09:03.367
and we text each other all day

09:03.467 --> 09:05.367
and we work together...

09:05.467 --> 09:07.200
maybe that's just
a little too much.

09:07.300 --> 09:11.067
- Oh.
Okay, I get it.

09:11.133 --> 09:12.633
You wanna take a break.
'Kay, fine.

09:12.733 --> 09:13.900
Let's take a break.

09:16.867 --> 09:18.233
about the end
of your friendship?

09:20.667 --> 09:23.067
- We... are on a break.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.167
- How you doin'?
- Not great.

09:49.967 --> 09:52.700
- Okay, how can you be
talented enough to do that,

09:52.800 --> 09:54.433
but you can't put

09:54.533 --> 09:55.933

10:03.067 --> 10:05.667
So, did you finish
the music for the game?

10:05.767 --> 10:07.433
- Yep, and you're gonna love it.

10:07.533 --> 10:09.133
Just cue up the beta version
of the game.

10:09.167 --> 10:11.400
- Ulch, I can't, 'cuz
I don't know the password

10:11.500 --> 10:13.933

Why are you laughing?

10:19.433 --> 10:20.867

- Trip, what's happening?

10:26.633 --> 10:28.800
- Oh, not much!
I just almost got

10:28.900 --> 10:30.267
my hand bit off
by a wild animal!

10:30.367 --> 10:31.900
- Hehehehe...

10:32.000 --> 10:34.533
- Well, I told you to keep
your hands off that monkey!

10:34.633 --> 10:36.800
- No you didn't!

10:36.900 --> 10:40.067
You said the monkey
wanted to be my friend!

10:40.167 --> 10:42.300
- Okay, what monkey
are we talking about?

10:42.400 --> 10:44.633
- Oh, I loaned my brother $200,

10:44.733 --> 10:46.633
and he promised to pay me
back in one week!

10:46.733 --> 10:48.600
Well, it's been eight days,

10:48.700 --> 10:51.133
and he hasn't
paid me back squat!

10:51.233 --> 10:53.500
- So my dad stole his monkey.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.633
- Hehehehe...

10:55.733 --> 10:59.100
- Hey Dub!
I got 'im!

10:59.200 --> 11:01.800
- Ah! Ah! Ah!

11:05.167 --> 11:07.333
- Aw, look at the cute monkey.
Can I hold him?

11:07.433 --> 11:09.233
- Sure.

11:12.167 --> 11:13.633
- Dub made me kidnap him.

11:13.733 --> 11:15.809
- Hey! I did not tell you
to kidnap that nasty monkey!

11:15.833 --> 11:17.700
- But you texted me and said...

11:17.800 --> 11:19.433
Uh, hey all I said was:

11:19.533 --> 11:21.767
Go to my brother
Corky's house at midnight

11:21.867 --> 11:23.600
bust open the back door

11:23.700 --> 11:25.533
find the monkey
put him in a sack,

11:25.633 --> 11:27.667
and bring him to my house.

11:27.767 --> 11:29.767
- Hey Dad guess what?
- What?

11:29.867 --> 11:31.867
- That's kidnapping!

11:31.967 --> 11:33.067
- Oh, okay!

11:33.133 --> 11:36.133
Everybody cares about me
kidnappin' the monkey...

11:36.233 --> 11:39.567
and you all are just fine
with my own brother

11:39.667 --> 11:41.233
kidnappin' my $200!

11:41.333 --> 11:44.833
- But he's your brother...
Give him back his monkey.

11:44.933 --> 11:48.700
- No money!
No monkey!

11:54.067 --> 11:55.567
- Oh my God.

11:55.667 --> 11:57.533
That monkey can play music.

11:57.633 --> 11:58.833
- Ho ho...

11:58.933 --> 12:01.233
that monkey can do
all kinds of things.

13:09.167 --> 13:11.300
All right, let's get
some coffee over here.

13:11.400 --> 13:12.600
- Yo, here comes a waitress.

13:12.700 --> 13:16.600
- Hi, what can I
get you gentleme...

13:16.700 --> 13:19.733
- Wha-what'd you
do to your head?

13:19.833 --> 13:21.733
- I went to get a blow-out,

13:21.833 --> 13:24.667
and I figured
I'd try a new style.

13:24.767 --> 13:29.300
- Did they give you
your money back?

13:29.400 --> 13:30.667
- Look, I'm working.

13:30.767 --> 13:32.800
Would you guys like
two bowls a'coffee?

13:32.900 --> 13:34.867
- C'mon Kenz...

13:34.967 --> 13:36.607
why don't you just
go over to Game Shakers

13:36.667 --> 13:37.733
and make up with Babe?

13:37.833 --> 13:39.067
- I'm not apologizing to her.

13:39.133 --> 13:43.467
- Hey hey...
I didn't say apologize.

13:43.567 --> 13:46.633
Will you just go talk to her?

13:46.733 --> 13:48.133
- I'll think about it.

13:49.733 --> 13:52.067
- Think she'll go?
- I hope so.

13:52.100 --> 13:54.180
'Cuz I don't like seein'
Babe and Kenzie bein' all...

13:54.233 --> 13:56.700
- Hiiiiiiiiiiiii.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.133
- Oh, here we go.

13:58.233 --> 14:00.367
- Heyyy cuteness!

14:00.467 --> 14:01.633
How's my little Triples?

14:01.733 --> 14:03.900
Hahahahaha

14:04.067 --> 14:05.333
- Uh, good... Wait...

14:05.433 --> 14:07.667
Wait how'd you know
I was gonna be here, now?

14:07.767 --> 14:11.233
- I put a tracking
device on you.

14:11.333 --> 14:13.600
- A tracking device?

14:13.700 --> 14:16.067
- Yeah.
I stuck it to your body

14:16.100 --> 14:19.867
so now I can use my phone
to find you wherever you go.

14:22.067 --> 14:23.743
- Well uh, what part of me
did ya stick it to?!?

14:23.767 --> 14:26.900
- I'lllll never telllllll.
Hahahahahahaha...

14:27.067 --> 14:28.467
- Haha...
Oh God!

14:28.567 --> 14:30.400
- Hahahahahaha...

14:30.500 --> 14:32.200
- Where is it?
Where is it?

14:32.300 --> 14:34.133
- Feel everywhere.

14:40.667 --> 14:42.300
- And now, see,
what I can do is...

14:42.400 --> 14:44.067
I can take a component
from level three,

14:44.100 --> 14:46.500
and then we just add it
here to the current functions.

14:46.600 --> 14:48.733
- Wow, you really
know your stuff...

14:48.833 --> 14:51.067
I assume.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.567
So, based on what you just did,

14:53.667 --> 14:56.367
do you think you
could code level four?

14:56.467 --> 14:57.600
- Yeah, and I can adjust it

14:57.700 --> 14:59.233
and make the game motion
more fluid.

14:59.333 --> 15:02.333
- Um, hello?

15:02.433 --> 15:04.433
- Oh... Hey.

15:04.533 --> 15:06.667
- Yeah, hey.

15:06.767 --> 15:07.867
Who's the skirt?

15:07.967 --> 15:10.067
- Oh!
Uh, this is Regina.

15:10.133 --> 15:14.067
- Hi.
- Yeah. Hey.

15:14.133 --> 15:16.300
- Sooo uh,
what happened to your hair?

15:16.400 --> 15:19.467
- Oh, so you hate it.
- I didn't say that.

15:19.567 --> 15:21.767
- You said,
"What happened to your hair?"

15:21.867 --> 15:23.800
Like it was in
some terrible tragedy...

15:23.900 --> 15:25.867
like my head might as well
be the Titanic...

15:25.967 --> 15:27.800
and you just said, "Ooo Kenzie,

15:27.900 --> 15:30.333
it looks like your hair sank
and everyone died."

15:32.167 --> 15:35.100
- That's um...
that's pretty dark.

15:39.433 --> 15:41.233
- Okay, would you tell
your little friend here

15:41.267 --> 15:42.900
to get her paws off my keyboard?

15:43.067 --> 15:46.300
- She's not my
little friend, she's...

15:46.400 --> 15:47.733
she's working here.

15:47.833 --> 15:50.533
- Whaddaya mean she's...

15:52.400 --> 15:54.933
You replaced me?!?

15:56.700 --> 15:58.100
- Well, what was
I supposed to do?

15:58.200 --> 15:59.476
We have games to make
and I need someone

15:59.500 --> 16:00.667
to write the code.

16:00.767 --> 16:02.133
- So that makes it
"okay" for you

16:02.233 --> 16:05.167
to bring in some
dirty street coder?

16:07.433 --> 16:10.100
You cheated on me.

16:10.200 --> 16:13.833
- Ah, don't leave!
Kenzie!

16:13.933 --> 16:18.133
We were...
We were on a break!!!

16:20.300 --> 16:22.067
- Ya did kinda' cheat on her.

16:22.133 --> 16:24.100
- We were on a break!!!

16:28.300 --> 16:30.700
- Aw man!
Oh oh oh!

16:30.800 --> 16:32.467
- Come on bro!

16:34.800 --> 16:35.800
- Hey Babe!

16:35.900 --> 16:37.267
- Where are you guys?

16:37.367 --> 16:39.067
- Oh, we're at that
cool coffee shop.

16:39.133 --> 16:40.900
Kenzie got a job here.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.800
- Look, I don't care about the...

16:42.900 --> 16:45.233
Kenzie got a job
at the coffee shop?

16:45.333 --> 16:46.367
- Yeah.

16:46.467 --> 16:48.500
But she still makes us
pay for the coffee.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.067
- Is that Babe?

16:50.133 --> 16:51.433
- Oh yeah, you wanna talk to...

16:51.533 --> 16:54.733
- BLEHHHH!

16:54.833 --> 16:56.433
Goodbye.

17:00.933 --> 17:02.600
- Come on, Dub.
Just eat the rest.

17:02.700 --> 17:04.500
- No!
I am not touchin' that pretzel,

17:04.600 --> 17:06.700
especially after
that diseased monkey

17:06.800 --> 17:08.533
took a bite out of it!

17:08.633 --> 17:11.300
- Dub, why don't you just give
the monkey back to your brother?

17:11.400 --> 17:13.200
- No. Not until he pays me back

17:13.300 --> 17:15.867
the $200 that I loaned him.

17:15.967 --> 17:17.300
Bunny. Go call my brother,

17:17.400 --> 17:19.600
and tell him he better give
me my money back today,

17:19.700 --> 17:23.433
or I'm sendin' that monkey
on a plane to Afghanistan!

17:25.067 --> 17:27.200
- Okay Dub.

17:29.333 --> 17:32.467
- Hey you, c'mere.

17:32.567 --> 17:33.933
- What?

17:34.067 --> 17:36.267
- I hear you and Kenzie
are on a "break."

17:36.367 --> 17:37.833
- Yeah. She got mad
about something

17:37.933 --> 17:39.367
that totally wasn't my fault.

17:39.467 --> 17:42.067
- Yeah yeah, well I understand
that but listen...

17:42.100 --> 17:43.533
when you mix it
up with a friend...

17:43.633 --> 17:45.933
especially someone
you're in business with...

17:46.067 --> 17:47.700
it doesn't matter
who started it.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.700
You gotta be the bigger person,

17:49.800 --> 17:52.067
and go and make things right.

17:52.167 --> 17:55.067
Especially if it's
somebody you love.

17:55.100 --> 17:57.300
- Hey Dub, your brother said

17:57.400 --> 17:58.909
he can get you the money
day after tomorrow.

17:58.933 --> 18:00.900
- Well, you tell my brother,

18:01.067 --> 18:02.267
he better get my money today,

18:02.367 --> 18:05.233
or tonight we're havin'
barbecued monkey!

18:08.633 --> 18:11.767
- Okay.

18:11.867 --> 18:13.600
- Now go and do the right thing.

18:15.367 --> 18:17.567
- Thank you for being
a role model.

18:22.267 --> 18:23.767
- Okay...
any special requests?

18:23.867 --> 18:24.967
Anyone?

18:25.067 --> 18:27.700
- Hi!
We're on our honeymoon.

18:27.800 --> 18:28.900
- We'd like to hear a song.

18:29.067 --> 18:32.433
- Ahhh, just married.
Nice.

18:32.533 --> 18:33.900
Well, there is a song I wrote

18:34.067 --> 18:35.800
when my Aunt Judy got married.

18:35.900 --> 18:38.900
I was only seven back then,
but I bet it still holds up.

19:58.067 --> 19:59.633
Here's your coffee.

19:59.733 --> 20:01.833
- Oh, we didn't order any...
- Owwww!

20:03.333 --> 20:05.667
- Why'd she do that?
- Oh my shirt!

20:05.767 --> 20:07.143
- Our outfits!

20:07.167 --> 20:09.400

20:12.433 --> 20:14.467
just spilled lukewarm
coffee all over us!

20:14.567 --> 20:17.267
She ruined our honeymoon
- Okay, don't worry...

20:17.367 --> 20:21.200
There'll be no charge
for the coffee.

20:21.300 --> 20:23.533
- We didn't even order it!

20:23.633 --> 20:25.433
- I told you:
the worst thing you can do

20:25.533 --> 20:27.200
is spill coffee on honeymooners!

20:27.300 --> 20:29.367
- But... but I didn't even...

20:29.467 --> 20:32.067
- I'm sorry, but you're fired.

20:32.167 --> 20:35.400
- Fired?

20:35.500 --> 20:39.667
You're seriously

Okay?

20:47.100 --> 20:50.100
You or anyone else

20:50.200 --> 20:52.533
would be lucky to work with her.

20:52.633 --> 20:56.500
Kenzie's not the kinda girl
you fire. No.

20:56.600 --> 20:59.233
Kenzie's the kinda
girl that makes you go,

20:59.333 --> 21:00.633
"Dang dawwwg, I can't believe

21:00.733 --> 21:03.967

21:10.133 --> 21:14.133
- All right.
I'm sorry.

21:14.233 --> 21:15.567
Kenzie, do you want
your job back?

21:15.667 --> 21:18.367
- Yes I would like...
- Too late!

21:18.467 --> 21:20.633
Once you diss her,
then you miss her.

21:23.700 --> 21:28.767
- Why is she talkin' like that?
- Ahahahaha.

21:28.867 --> 21:30.267
- And anyway...

21:30.367 --> 21:33.367
Kenzie has a better job.

21:33.467 --> 21:38.200
And I hope she comes back.

21:38.300 --> 21:40.043
That was the sweetest apology
I've ever heard.

21:40.067 --> 21:42.900
I didn't apologize...
This whole thing was your fault.

21:43.067 --> 21:45.067
- My fault?!?

21:47.400 --> 21:49.767
- Oh yeah.
All your fault.

21:51.133 --> 21:52.733
- But...
I love you anyway...

21:52.833 --> 21:55.067
and I don't wanna
be on a break anymore.

21:55.100 --> 21:56.367
- You want me back?

21:56.467 --> 22:00.367
- Yeah.
But, with your old hair.

22:02.967 --> 22:05.400
- Hey c'mon, let's go
do somethin' fun.
