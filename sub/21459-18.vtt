00:01.668 --> 00:06.214
{\an8}(Juliette)
They say that being young
is the best time of your life.

00:06.297 --> 00:08.550
{\an1}I'm a sucker
for fairy tales.

00:08.633 --> 00:09.426
(Juliette)
But what they don't tell you

00:09.509 --> 00:12.178
is that it's also
the most confusing.

00:12.262 --> 00:14.305
Why is he doing this to me?

00:14.389 --> 00:17.225
{\an5}(Juliette)
We live in a world where we
have to juggle school...

00:17.308 --> 00:18.518
(girl)
Where is he going?

00:18.601 --> 00:19.310
{\an1}He's going off to
law school.

00:19.394 --> 00:22.063
(Juliette)
Start our careers...

00:22.147 --> 00:23.523
deal with our parents...

00:23.606 --> 00:24.983
If you're gonna be
committed to somebody,

00:25.066 --> 00:26.276
then you need to be
committed.

00:26.359 --> 00:27.819
(Juliette)
And never settle.

00:27.902 --> 00:28.611
{\an5}(Kelsey)
I don't want to bartend
for the rest of my life.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.947
I don't have a plan "B."

00:31.030 --> 00:32.448
(Juliette)
And in between all of this,

00:32.531 --> 00:35.869
find time for love
and all the craziness it brings.

00:35.952 --> 00:38.955
{\an5}(Chloe)
Alex and Juliette were
all over each other.

00:39.038 --> 00:40.623
He was cheating on me.

00:40.707 --> 00:41.958
I'm just tired
of being the nice guy.

00:42.041 --> 00:43.293
Kelsey's ruining my life.

00:43.376 --> 00:44.669
Get your hands off me!

00:44.753 --> 00:46.504
(overlapping shouting
and bleeping)

00:46.588 --> 00:48.465
{\an5}She's a (bleep) bitch!

00:46.588 --> 00:48.465
{\an1}(Bleep)!

00:48.548 --> 00:49.591
(Brandon)
I went home with another girl.

00:49.674 --> 00:51.384
{\an5}(Madisson)
Why would you tell me
you love me

00:51.468 --> 00:53.052
when clearly you don't?

00:53.136 --> 00:54.554
{\an3}I do!

00:53.136 --> 00:54.554
Oh, my God!

00:54.637 --> 00:56.014
You're just
so full of (bleep).

00:56.097 --> 00:57.515
Not even (bleep) funny.

00:57.599 --> 00:59.642
{\an5}(Juliette)
Some of us were
exploring our options...

00:59.726 --> 01:01.519
{\an5}You want to go back
to my place?

00:59.726 --> 01:01.519
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

01:01.603 --> 01:02.812
(Paige)
I've never dated a girl before.

01:02.896 --> 01:06.149
{\an5}(Juliette)
While some of us just
wanted to be understood.

01:06.232 --> 01:07.984
{\an1}You won't even admit
you're gay to me!

01:08.067 --> 01:09.152
Yes, I'm gay.

01:09.235 --> 01:10.236
(Juliette)
Some of us

01:10.320 --> 01:11.821
were hoping
for a miracle...

01:11.905 --> 01:13.364
I'm so sorry, babe.

01:13.448 --> 01:15.658
I can't be with you.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.244
{\an5}(Brandon)
I got a song dedicated
towards Madisson.

01:18.328 --> 01:19.788
♪ Young, dumb and stupid ♪

01:19.871 --> 01:21.039
♪ Still, that's no excuse... ♪

01:21.122 --> 01:24.501
{\an5}(Juliette)
And some of us couldn't
let go of the past.

01:24.584 --> 01:25.960
I don't know if he's ever
gonna trust me again

01:26.044 --> 01:27.337
after what I did.

01:27.420 --> 01:28.505
(Juliette)
And as for me,

01:28.588 --> 01:30.006
I didn't listen
to anyone's advice

01:30.089 --> 01:32.133
and took back
my first love,

01:32.217 --> 01:34.344
even though he had
completely screwed me over.

01:34.427 --> 01:36.346
{\an1}You think you can just
hook up with people

01:36.429 --> 01:37.847
and that's not
gonna hurt me.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.432
(Juliette)
Everyone warned me.

01:39.516 --> 01:40.809
You know he's hurt you
in the past,

01:40.892 --> 01:43.228
his cheating on you
with other girls.

01:43.311 --> 01:44.562
{\an1}(Chloe)
Like, oh, congratulations,

01:44.646 --> 01:46.314
you're with the biggest
cheater of Siesta Key.

01:46.397 --> 01:48.900
{\an4}(Hannah)
In Alex's case,
there's no better way

01:48.983 --> 01:50.693
{\an1}to forecast the future
than the past.

01:50.777 --> 01:51.861
(Juliette)
But when you're that in love,

01:51.945 --> 01:55.323
you'll lose anything and anyone
to be with your guy.

01:55.406 --> 01:56.991
{\an5}I don't give a (bleep)
what you've got to say.

01:55.406 --> 01:56.991
Listen...

01:57.075 --> 01:58.409
{\an1}No!

01:57.075 --> 01:58.409
Stop! Stop!

01:58.493 --> 02:00.161
Don't come to me with
your problems anymore

02:00.245 --> 02:01.454
when he does do
the things that he does.

02:01.538 --> 02:03.289
{\an1}I'm not gonna live my life
to please you.

02:03.373 --> 02:06.376
{\an5}(Juliette)
And after everything
I went through,

02:06.459 --> 02:08.252
I really thought things
would have been different.

02:08.336 --> 02:10.713
I'm not gonna let
Hannah badmouth me.

02:10.797 --> 02:14.008
{\an1}She's skeptical of the guy
that's cheated on me before.

02:14.092 --> 02:16.427
{\an5}(Juliette)
But I guess that's the biggest
thing about being young.

02:16.511 --> 02:20.723

to be learned.

02:52.338 --> 02:53.715
{\an7}(Chloe)
I am so tired from last night.

02:53.798 --> 02:54.716
{\an7}(Juliette)
Me, too.

02:54.799 --> 02:55.717
{\an8}I love his house.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.177
{\an8}It was a lot of fun,

02:58.261 --> 03:00.847
{\an7}but Hannah and Alex,
like, got into it.

03:00.930 --> 03:03.141
{\an8}What were they even
fighting about?

03:03.224 --> 03:04.642
{\an8}So, on the boat day,

03:04.726 --> 03:07.645
{\an7}apparently Hannah
was telling Paul, like,

03:07.729 --> 03:09.647
{\an7}"Alex is gonna hurt
Juliette again," like...

03:09.731 --> 03:11.274
{\an8}"He's still the same.
He's gonna cheat."

03:11.357 --> 03:14.694
{\an7}And so Paul ran
and told Alex, obviously,

03:14.777 --> 03:16.112
{\an8}and, you know Alex.

03:16.195 --> 03:20.742
{\an7}He's just over people
saying that he's gonna hurt me.

03:20.825 --> 03:21.868
{\an7}(Alex)
Did you have fun?

03:21.951 --> 03:22.619
{\an9}Yeah. Ooh.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.996
{\an7}God, you're still trash
at pool.

03:25.079 --> 03:26.164
{\an8}I just made two.

03:26.247 --> 03:27.248
{\an8}The cue ball doesn't count.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.207
{\an8}(Pauly laughs)

03:28.291 --> 03:29.292
{\an8}I had a fun time,

03:29.375 --> 03:30.793
but Hannah
is a big problem.

03:30.877 --> 03:33.504
{\an1}She's like a little rat,
like, just in Juliette's ear,

03:33.588 --> 03:34.380
and it's exhausting.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.341
{\an1}It's like I'm almost
dating two girls.

03:36.424 --> 03:40.011
{\an5}(Chloe)
Hannah's not being
unreasonable.

03:40.094 --> 03:42.931
Like, he's cheated
on you so many times.

03:43.014 --> 03:45.600
{\an4}Yeah.

03:43.014 --> 03:45.600
And I feel like
she just wants, like,

03:45.683 --> 03:46.851
the best for you.

03:46.935 --> 03:49.270
{\an1}I haven't done anything wrong
in so long,

03:49.354 --> 03:51.522
{\an1}but the second
I prove myself to Juliette,

03:51.606 --> 03:53.775
{\an1}Hannah just bats it
all the way back down,

03:53.858 --> 03:55.818
{\an1}and it's starting
to feel like a job.

03:55.902 --> 03:59.697
Well, is Alex worth losing
Hannah's friendship?

03:59.781 --> 04:02.408
{\an1}I don't think that it
should ever have to come

04:02.492 --> 04:03.993
{\an5}to that situation.

04:02.492 --> 04:03.993
Seems like it kind of is.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.578
Every time they're
around each other,

04:05.662 --> 04:07.956
they're screaming
and fighting.

04:08.039 --> 04:10.792
{\an5}(Pauly)
I'd really like to see you
get into a relationship

04:10.875 --> 04:12.210
where you don't have
all that stress.

04:12.293 --> 04:13.586
I am stressed out,

04:13.670 --> 04:15.088
{\an1}going to school
four days a week,

04:15.171 --> 04:16.630
{\an1}traveling
four and a half hours there

04:16.714 --> 04:18.507
{\an1}all the way to Florida State
to visit her.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.385
{\an1}I don't need
any more added stress.

04:20.468 --> 04:22.679
{\an1}It's ruining our relationship,
honestly.

04:22.762 --> 04:25.056
(Chloe)
Do <i> you</i> trust him?

04:25.974 --> 04:28.184
{\an4}(Pauly)
I mean, if she
doesn't trust you,

04:28.267 --> 04:29.936
{\an1}then she probably
never would.

04:30.019 --> 04:33.523

{\an8}(Madisson)
I don't care.

05:06.556 --> 05:08.391
{\an8}No, I don't want to
go say hi yet.

I'll introduce you
to everybody.

05:40.548 --> 05:42.467

05:59.567 --> 06:00.568
{\an1}Hey, Kelsey,
I saw you, um,

06:00.651 --> 06:01.778
at the charity event.

06:00.651 --> 06:01.778
{\an1}Yeah.

06:01.861 --> 06:03.946
Hey, nice to meet you.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.157
{\an5}You came here
with Garrett?

06:04.030 --> 06:06.157
Yeah. Yeah, he invited me.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.658
What are you doing?

06:07.742 --> 06:08.868
What do you mean?

06:08.951 --> 06:10.787
{\an1}Are you serious
right now?

06:10.870 --> 06:14.123
{\an8}Do you not know the impression
you're giving by bringing her?

06:14.207 --> 06:15.541
{\an5}She doesn't know anybody.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.541
{\an1}Garrett...

06:15.625 --> 06:17.543
First of all, you didn't
tell me she was coming,

06:17.627 --> 06:20.546

blindsided Kelsey feels.

know anybody here,

07:23.109 --> 07:24.402

it'd be nice to, like,

No.

How does it make you
feel uncomfortable?

23:38.792 --> 23:41.169

be there and these two...

what that means.

23:44.923 --> 23:46.758

{\an4}What, am I supposed
to go home alone?

23:46.842 --> 23:49.636

{\an1}You get to go out
with your best friends

23:54.057 --> 23:55.100

No, obviously I'm not

"Oh, my God."

24:55.577 --> 24:58.246
{\an7}(Madisson)
Yeah. I thought
the song was amazing,

24:58.330 --> 25:01.166
{\an7}but then it was just, like,
such a high and then such a low

25:01.249 --> 25:01.958

"I can't... I...

25:02.042 --> 25:03.835

25:18.808 --> 25:20.310

{\an1}But, like, it's been,
like, good to just have,

25:22.354 --> 25:23.730
{\an1}like, an old friend

25:23.813 --> 25:26.900
