leaving town

00:13.959 --> 00:16.917

Time for dinner!

Come on!

Oh, he's probably in there
humping that therapy doll

You know, right, right,

00:51.166 --> 00:53.041
Chad, what are you doing here?

00:53.041 --> 00:55.083
I was coming
to get my dog back.

00:55.083 --> 00:56.166
Then why is the
room destroyed?

00:56.166 --> 00:59.083
Because we had
a very happy reunion.

00:59.083 --> 01:00.625
All right? We engaged
in some roughhousing,

01:00.625 --> 01:02.208
and we have
a very physical relationship.

01:02.208 --> 01:03.709
COLLEEN:
Chad, you're supposed to be--

01:03.709 --> 01:05.333
Oh, my God, I just realized
that we're still naked.

01:05.333 --> 01:06.625
Yep, uh, air just kicked on.

01:06.625 --> 01:09.083
-I got the same draft.
-Mhm.

All right, Chad.

What the hell's going on?

01:13.041 --> 01:15.709
I know you guys are upset,
and I shouldn't have broken

01:15.709 --> 01:17.208
that window
when the door was open,

01:17.208 --> 01:19.000
or tried on your dad's hats.

01:19.000 --> 01:19.917
Okay, how long were you here?

01:19.917 --> 01:21.667
Sh, do I interrupt you?

Do I break into your house
and interrupt you?

01:23.250 --> 01:24.208
Yes!

01:24.208 --> 01:26.125
I came here to pick up Princess,

01:26.125 --> 01:28.250
because I've
turned my life around.

01:28.250 --> 01:29.709
It's like that movie
<i>The Notebook</i>

01:29.709 --> 01:32.250
if what happens is a guy
goes back to get his dog

01:32.250 --> 01:33.375
after turning his life around.

01:33.375 --> 01:34.625

01:36.000 --> 01:37.333
I will take you up
on that water, Matt.

01:37.333 --> 01:39.166
I didn't offer you a water,
Chad.

01:39.166 --> 01:40.417
You're gonna want to.

01:40.417 --> 01:42.083
Because I'm about
to change your lives.

01:44.291 --> 01:45.500
Think about
all the time you spend

01:45.500 --> 01:47.709
washing and cleaning
your clothes.

01:47.709 --> 01:48.709
But...

01:48.709 --> 01:51.583
how much time do you spend

01:51.583 --> 01:54.125
on the thing you wear most?

01:54.125 --> 01:56.250
Your skin clothes.

01:56.250 --> 01:57.458
-What's happening?
-I don't know.

01:57.458 --> 01:59.250
It's the thing
you're wrapped up in

01:59.250 --> 02:02.250
that says hello
before<i> you </i>do.

02:02.250 --> 02:04.709
Behold.

02:04.709 --> 02:06.083
My cream.

02:08.291 --> 02:11.250
But... he's selling
skin products?

02:11.250 --> 02:13.208
Yeah, I hate to say it, but his
skin does look really great.

02:13.208 --> 02:15.041
-Did you see his pores?
-No.

02:15.041 --> 02:16.291
-Yeah, neither did I.
-No, but he's supposed to be

02:16.291 --> 02:17.458
in prison right now.

02:17.458 --> 02:19.291
Not starting an exciting
and flexible new career.

02:19.291 --> 02:20.333
-I know.
-And we're supposed to be

02:20.333 --> 02:22.041
having a romantic weekend.

02:22.041 --> 02:24.750
-What do we do?
-We gotta call the cops.

02:24.750 --> 02:27.083
Mm, okay, you're right,
you're right.

02:27.083 --> 02:28.083
I will call the cops.

02:28.083 --> 02:29.166
Keep him here,
keep him talking.

02:29.166 --> 02:30.166
Right.

02:30.166 --> 02:31.667
CHAD: Okay, active ingredient

02:31.667 --> 02:34.375
in the restorative cream
is oxygen.

02:34.375 --> 02:36.458
Fun fact:
you can breathe this stuff.

02:36.458 --> 02:37.542
-No, you can't.
-Yeah.

02:37.542 --> 02:39.417
I once kept a goldfish
in there for seven minutes.

02:39.417 --> 02:40.792
-What?
-Yeah.

02:40.792 --> 02:42.333
Now, I can sell this
to you for retail,

02:42.333 --> 02:44.250
but if you become
a representative,

02:44.250 --> 02:45.750
I can get it to you
wholesale price.

02:45.750 --> 02:47.500
How would you like to be
your own boss, Matt?

02:47.500 --> 02:49.250
Oh, so this is
a pyramid scheme?

02:49.250 --> 02:50.792
No, it's
a legitimate business.

02:50.792 --> 02:52.333
No, but it's
actually called Ponzi.

02:52.333 --> 02:53.709
CHAD: It's pronounced<i> Pone-zee.</i>

02:53.709 --> 02:55.500
And the bottle
are actually pyramids.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.208
It's upside down.

02:59.333 --> 03:01.709
Okay, you broke it,
you got to buy it, so...

03:01.709 --> 03:03.166
I'll take it out
of your first month's supply.

03:04.792 --> 03:06.208
No, no, he doesn't have
a weapon,

03:06.208 --> 03:07.375
but he's supposed
to be in prison.

03:07.375 --> 03:09.291
You have to come get him.

03:09.291 --> 03:10.250
What's he doing right now?

03:10.250 --> 03:12.250
(scoffs)

03:12.250 --> 03:14.542
He's selling my boyfriend
face cream.

03:14.542 --> 03:15.875
Not a priority?

03:15.875 --> 03:17.375
He's a fugitive.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.333
Tax evasion.

03:20.333 --> 03:21.291
(groans)

03:21.291 --> 03:22.959
Oh, great.

03:22.959 --> 03:24.166

03:25.333 --> 03:27.083
-Well?
-Cops are coming Monday.

03:27.083 --> 03:28.458
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

03:28.458 --> 03:29.792
Okay, we're gonna have to get
him out of here ourselves.

03:29.792 --> 03:30.750
What are we gonna do?

03:30.750 --> 03:31.875
-Just follow my lead.
-Okay.

03:31.875 --> 03:34.208
CHAD: I think you guys should
try this exfoliating scrub.

03:34.208 --> 03:35.625
It's like Pop Rocks
for your face.

03:35.625 --> 03:37.458
And fun fact:
it's Pop Rocks.

03:37.458 --> 03:39.500
Hey, Chad, fun fact:
we called the cops.

03:39.500 --> 03:40.667
You got about five minutes
before they show up,

03:40.667 --> 03:42.625
arrest you
and take you back to jail.

03:42.625 --> 03:44.208
You ratted me out?

03:44.208 --> 03:45.417
Yeah, you better get going.

03:51.333 --> 03:52.750
And after I offered you a chance

03:52.750 --> 03:55.625
to make millions of dollars
in the comfort of your own home.

03:55.625 --> 03:57.875
Tick-tock.

03:57.875 --> 04:01.417
Oh, I was a mortgage broker.

04:01.417 --> 04:02.792
I had a fiancée.

04:02.792 --> 04:03.875
-You.
-Me.

04:03.875 --> 04:06.250
I had a purebred poodle mix.

04:06.250 --> 04:08.250
And now I'm on the run.

04:08.250 --> 04:11.208
I'm squatting in a house
that I sold to a woman

04:11.208 --> 04:12.875
who's too old to use the stairs.

04:12.875 --> 04:14.667
If I have to hear her
open the door and say,

04:14.667 --> 04:17.959
"Is someone down there?" one
more time, I'm gonna lose it!

04:17.959 --> 04:19.458
Mm.

04:19.458 --> 04:21.166
I just want my life back.

04:21.166 --> 04:22.500

04:22.500 --> 04:24.458
I want<i> us </i>back.

04:24.458 --> 04:26.458
-Oh, no.
-That's just not...

04:26.458 --> 04:28.083
-I'm hugging everybody.
-Okay, that's great.

04:28.083 --> 04:30.458
But look, you're running
out of time here, Chad.

04:30.458 --> 04:32.333
-Okay.
-Look, I'm really sorry

04:32.333 --> 04:33.709
that all of this has happened,
but on some sort of level

04:33.709 --> 04:35.750
you had to know that this day
was gonna come, right?

04:35.750 --> 04:37.250
Yeah.

04:37.250 --> 04:38.709
But I thought success
in my own skin care line

04:38.709 --> 04:41.417
was going to fix the complexion
of our relationship.

04:41.417 --> 04:43.333
Now I see the only way
to turn things around

04:43.333 --> 04:46.667
for us is to accept
the consequences of my actions.

04:46.667 --> 04:48.875
So I'm gonna let the cops
come and get me.

04:48.875 --> 04:50.333

-No.

-Great.

05:15.417 --> 05:17.250
ask them if they care
about skin health.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.542
If the answer is yes, have
them call ten of their friends.

05:19.542 --> 05:21.083
-Hear me out.
-Or we could just drive you

05:21.083 --> 05:23.417
to prison, again.

05:23.417 --> 05:25.750
You can pick the music
this time.

05:36.417 --> 05:37.667
Another ten minutes
in that car ride to prison,

05:37.667 --> 05:40.458
I would've bought
his entire line of lotions.

05:40.458 --> 05:42.250
Now he can use them as a
dowry for his prison wife.

Like how?

06:44.500 --> 06:46.875

like the firm handshake

Will you get the stuff
the doctor gave me, okay?

07:36.375 --> 07:37.750

15:56.083 --> 15:58.375
till she's about 23, then
you have a couple good years.

15:58.375 --> 16:00.166
She'll go back
to sea beast.

16:00.166 --> 16:02.333
Then, after that, it just
rotates, depending on nothing.

16:02.333 --> 16:04.542
But Tyler was never a sea beast.

16:04.542 --> 16:07.125
No, because Tyler takes
40-minute showers.

16:07.125 --> 16:09.125
-Ah.
-His puberty is single-handedly

16:09.125 --> 16:10.959
-responsible for the drought.
-Ah.

16:10.959 --> 16:12.417
You know, she's becoming
a young woman.

16:12.417 --> 16:15.083
She--she has new friends
and new feelings,

16:15.083 --> 16:18.000
and she just wants to be
treated like an adult.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.041
So, we just talk
about interest rates

16:19.041 --> 16:20.500
and how bad our knees hurt?

16:20.500 --> 16:23.041
No, you talk about nothing.

16:23.041 --> 16:26.166
You just try to avoid eye
contact and stay out of her way.

16:26.166 --> 16:28.083
Treat her like my mom.
Got it.

16:28.083 --> 16:30.291
Hey, girls, pizza's here.

16:30.291 --> 16:32.959
Hey, so, should I serve them, or
are they gonna serve themselves?

16:32.959 --> 16:36.125
I mean, how does this work
exact...

16:36.125 --> 16:38.375
Heather?

16:38.375 --> 16:41.417
Oh, she is good at this.

16:41.417 --> 16:44.000
Hello, ladies.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.208
You partying or what?

16:46.208 --> 16:50.333
Dad, are you gonna eat with us?

16:50.333 --> 16:52.000
No.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.125
I can find someplace else
to eat.

16:57.041 --> 16:59.000

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
KYLIE: This is so fake.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.375
In real life, you have
to turn your head to the side,

17:07.375 --> 17:09.208
and open your mouth
only a little.

17:09.208 --> 17:10.208
That way the boy
still has to work

17:10.208 --> 17:12.250
to get it all the way open.

17:13.667 --> 17:15.500
I like scary movies.

17:15.500 --> 17:17.208
PG is for babies.

17:17.208 --> 17:20.083
TIM: You guys like scary movies,
huh?

17:20.083 --> 17:22.542
I got a good one for you,
but it's rated R.

17:22.542 --> 17:23.667
Really?

17:23.667 --> 17:25.500
My mom lets me
watch R movies.

17:25.500 --> 17:28.500
TIM: Yeah,
but have you seen<i> Alien?</i>

17:28.500 --> 17:30.083
What, is that like<i> E.T.?</i>

17:30.083 --> 17:31.959
Yeah, if E.T. went...

17:31.959 --> 17:35.500

17:35.500 --> 17:38.417
"And the cow vowed
to always eat clover,

leaves it had."

felt especially happy..."

<i>I </i>watch the movie, too?

are still a kid,

to stay that way forever.
