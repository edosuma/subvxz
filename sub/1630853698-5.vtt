He's asked me about you
a couple of dozen times.

00:13.448 --> 00:16.103
- I guess it's a good thing
that I called after all.

00:16.233 --> 00:17.408
- You know, Jill actually
made this dress.

00:17.539 --> 00:18.409
- Did she?

00:18.540 --> 00:20.237
- Ma.
- So talented.

00:20.368 --> 00:21.325
Why doesn't
she have a full-time job?

00:21.456 --> 00:23.414
- Oh no. You and Mimi
just broke up?

00:23.545 --> 00:25.460
- She breaks up with me
in a fucking letter.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.114

my life out

it's immediately catchy.

it's a lot more melodic

I don't know but yeah,

- Well, she has just written
a pretty great new song,

04:24.699 --> 04:27.441
and maybe she might play
a little bit for you

04:27.571 --> 04:28.833
to cheer your brother up?

04:28.964 --> 04:30.661
- Oh. Help cheer
my brother up?

04:30.792 --> 04:32.446
Oh, that would be so sweet,
wouldn't it?

04:32.576 --> 04:34.491
Why would I ever do that?

04:34.622 --> 04:35.449
- Because
it's a really nice song,

04:35.579 --> 04:37.538
and you used his name in it.

04:37.668 --> 04:40.236
- I-I do not use his name.
- You don't?

04:51.682 --> 04:54.511

04:54.642 --> 04:56.731

my head, that's all.

04:56.861 --> 04:58.776
- Jimbo, look,
I think it's obvious.

04:58.907 --> 05:00.735
She knows the pain that
you're going through over Maya,

05:00.865 --> 05:02.171
and she feels for you
so much so

05:02.302 --> 05:03.564
that she wrote
a song about it,

05:03.694 --> 05:05.261
even if it is subconscious.

05:05.392 --> 05:07.219
And as you father, I gotta say
that warms my heart.

- Okay. Now you're not
ever gonna hear the song.

05:09.526 --> 05:11.398
And to be clear,
it is not about you.

05:11.528 --> 05:13.182
And lastly, Dad,
can you please go back to

05:13.313 --> 05:14.749
focusing on him and his shit
instead of me and my shit?

05:14.879 --> 05:16.446

like that.

05:16.577 --> 05:19.144
- Forgive me, okay?

05:19.275 --> 05:20.929

05:21.059 --> 05:22.452
- So you're totally okay

new girlfriend of his?

05:24.454 --> 05:25.368
- Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

We broke up.
It's-it's all good.

05:26.543 --> 05:27.718

and chill as Tammy.

05:37.902 --> 05:39.817
- Yeah, very cool.
Very chill.

05:39.948 --> 05:42.472
- You know, I think that
most people would not like to

05:42.603 --> 05:44.387
meet their boyfriends
or girlfriend's exes, you know?

05:44.518 --> 05:46.694
'Cause
once you meet the ex,

05:46.824 --> 05:48.826
then you just can't help
but compare yourself to them.

05:48.957 --> 05:50.698
And then all of a sudden,
you're filled with self-doubt

05:50.828 --> 05:52.569
and it poisons the mind,

05:52.700 --> 05:54.571
and ultimately
damages the relationship.

05:54.702 --> 05:56.921
- Yeah.
- He's got very low self-esteem.

05:57.052 --> 05:58.532
Always has.

05:58.662 --> 06:01.404
- Yeah, Jules,
he is a little loony.

06:01.535 --> 06:02.579
- Okay. You know what?
Maybe I am.

06:02.710 --> 06:04.799
But I am happy in my lunacy.

06:04.929 --> 06:06.322
You know,
and for the record,

06:06.453 --> 06:08.890
I have no interest in meeting
your ex-boyfriend.

06:09.020 --> 06:11.762
I don't care if he's the
greatest guy that's ever lived.

06:11.893 --> 06:13.198
I don't want
to hear about him.

06:13.329 --> 06:14.635
- All right. All right,

06:14.765 --> 06:15.984
which is why
I never mention him.

06:16.114 --> 06:18.203
But he is actually
a pretty good guy.

06:18.334 --> 06:19.901
- I thought I just said
I don't wanna hear it.

06:20.031 --> 06:22.425
- Okay. Well, I definitely
do wanna hear it.

06:37.919 --> 06:40.443
- Well, just like
how I introduced Pags

06:40.574 --> 06:41.749
into the music world,
he's the one

06:41.879 --> 06:44.534
who got me in the business
in the first place.

06:44.665 --> 06:47.624
- Wait, what?
He works in the music biz?

06:47.755 --> 06:48.930
Is that why
he wants to see you?

06:49.060 --> 06:51.411
You know,
he called her yesterday.

06:51.541 --> 06:54.065
- Okay. I don't think we need
to talk about this right now.

06:54.196 --> 06:56.503
- Oh no, we definitely do need
to talk about this right now.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.983
So what does he do
in the business exactly?

06:59.114 --> 07:00.855
- I can handle it.

07:02.857 --> 07:04.380
- Uh, he's a music attorney.

07:04.511 --> 07:06.338
- What?

07:06.469 --> 07:08.863
I'm sorry, he's a--
he's a music attorney?

07:08.993 --> 07:10.473

07:10.604 --> 07:12.606

07:12.736 --> 07:15.652
- I know, which is why
I never ever mentioned it.

07:15.783 --> 07:17.785
- So what did he want?
Why did he call you?

07:17.915 --> 07:19.047
- We're just
having breakfast.

07:19.177 --> 07:20.570
We're discussing
a business opportunity

- [laughing]

07:24.574 --> 07:26.489

he has in mind

07:26.620 --> 07:27.969
and where he wants to
pitch it.

- I missed you.

I'm really sorry.

impressed I am with you both?

08:01.437 --> 08:03.483
I mean, Lucy and Tammy
for meeting like this.

08:03.613 --> 08:07.356
It's incredibly fucking brave

08:07.487 --> 08:09.401

I mean, Mikey,
how are you doing right now?

08:11.447 --> 08:13.362
- Don't worry about me, Pags.
I'm fine, okay?

08:13.493 --> 08:15.495
- Yeah. Me and Tammy are doing
just fine too. Right, Tammy?

08:15.625 --> 08:16.931
- So far so good.

08:17.061 --> 08:20.021
- So this isn't just
so unbelievably weird

08:20.151 --> 08:21.718
and uncomfortable
for you guys now?

08:21.849 --> 08:23.024
- No. Not at all.
I mean, why would it be?

08:23.154 --> 08:24.765

Look at how happy they are.

08:24.895 --> 08:26.636

- I'm fine.

08:35.950 --> 08:37.560
than have never loved
at all, right?

Don't worry, all right?

08:39.954 --> 08:41.869
That feeling you got inside?
That hurt?

08:41.999 --> 08:44.524
It'll pass in due time.
I promise.

08:44.654 --> 08:47.004
- Hey, it's the price we pay,
isn't it?

08:47.135 --> 08:48.658
- It is.
- That's right.

08:48.789 --> 08:49.964
- Are you kidding me?
Look at these guys.

08:50.094 --> 08:51.618
Lucy, I've gotta warn you,
all right?

08:51.748 --> 08:53.489
These three right here,
one, two, three,

08:53.620 --> 08:55.491
they're the biggest bunch
of emotional basket cases

08:55.622 --> 08:57.058
you will ever meet
in your life.

08:57.188 --> 08:59.016
- Will you listen to the way
they're talking about us, boys?

08:59.147 --> 09:01.584
They're talking about this
like it's a bad thing.

09:01.715 --> 09:03.630
I thought women liked the guy

09:03.760 --> 09:04.979
who was in touch
with his emotions,

09:05.109 --> 09:07.982
a guy who was strong enough...
heh, heh, heh,

09:08.112 --> 09:09.984
to be sensitive.

09:10.114 --> 09:12.377
I mean, a-a guy
who was not afraid

09:12.508 --> 09:16.164
to weep and cry and mope.
I mean, maybe I'm wrong.

09:16.294 --> 09:17.513
- See, Lucy?
Welcome to the family.

09:17.644 --> 09:18.775
Get ready.

09:18.906 --> 09:23.127
[overlapping chatter]

09:23.258 --> 09:24.999
- You're being ridiculous.
Do you know that?

09:25.129 --> 09:27.654
- Am I, though? [chuckles]

09:27.784 --> 09:29.090
I mean, she said
she'd call after breakfast

09:29.220 --> 09:31.658
and it's...it's almost 11:30.

09:31.788 --> 09:34.530
I mean, what could
she be doing with him?

09:34.661 --> 09:36.793
- Nick, you have to
calm down, okay?

09:36.924 --> 09:38.186
They're probably
just at his apartment

09:38.316 --> 09:40.971
hanging out,
fucking like rabbits.

09:41.102 --> 09:42.973
- Very fucking funny, Lizzie.

09:43.104 --> 09:44.714
You know, like
I-I haven't thought of that

09:44.845 --> 09:46.542
like a thousand times.

09:46.673 --> 09:49.414
God, you know, it's--it's not
like I don't trust her.

09:49.545 --> 09:51.678
It's just, you know,
where my mind goes.

09:51.808 --> 09:52.896
- Yeah.
But you do trust her, right?

09:53.027 --> 09:55.159
- I mean, of course.
I-I love her.

09:55.290 --> 09:57.118
- Okay.
Quit being a dick.

09:57.248 --> 09:58.815
Sit your ass down
and stop worrying about it.

09:58.946 --> 10:01.601
- You're right. [chuckles]
Oh, God.

10:01.731 --> 10:02.950
I mean, what am I doing?

10:03.080 --> 10:04.560
- I don't know, being a dick.

10:04.691 --> 10:06.388
[phone rings]

10:06.518 --> 10:08.564
- Hello?

10:08.695 --> 10:09.783
Hey, how was it?

10:09.913 --> 10:11.959
Oh. [chuckles]

10:12.089 --> 10:14.744
And what was--what was
this big, you know,

10:14.875 --> 10:16.616
business opportunity?

10:18.008 --> 10:20.663
Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
we can...

10:20.794 --> 10:23.100
we can talk later...
in person.

10:25.146 --> 10:26.147
Okay, bye.

10:29.977 --> 10:33.415
- So was I right or like,
you know?

10:33.545 --> 10:34.938
- Fuck you.

10:35.069 --> 10:37.027
- I'm so surprised
that your new agent

10:37.158 --> 10:39.682
thinks that you need
new headshots.

10:39.813 --> 10:41.466
What are you,
auditioning to be

10:41.597 --> 10:42.946
a fucking magician's assistant
or something?

10:43.077 --> 10:44.905
[laughs]
You need to get these redone.

10:45.035 --> 10:46.515
- Yeah, I do,
but I can't ask my dad

10:46.646 --> 10:47.690
for any more money, so....

10:47.821 --> 10:48.996
- So just ask Jimmy
to come and do it.

10:49.126 --> 10:50.780
He's not going away anymore.
He'll do it for free.

10:50.911 --> 10:52.521
- You think he'd do that?

10:52.652 --> 10:55.045
Or is this just an excuse
to get him to come over here

10:55.176 --> 10:56.612
so that you
can see him again?

10:56.743 --> 10:58.483
- No, I just think
this photo screams,

10:58.614 --> 11:00.572
"Please saw me in half."

11:00.703 --> 11:02.096
- So let me
get this straight.

11:02.226 --> 11:04.141
You want me to call Jimmy,
get him to come over here

11:04.272 --> 11:08.015
to take my headshots
and that's it, huh?

11:08.145 --> 11:10.147
- Yeah. I mean, look,
you can't afford new headshots.

11:10.278 --> 11:12.715
He'll do it for free.
It's a perfect solution.

11:12.846 --> 11:14.804
- Mmm.

11:14.935 --> 11:17.677
- And the light in here--
it can't be beat.

11:17.807 --> 11:19.200
- All right, Jimbo,

11:19.330 --> 11:20.897
let's get that bad boy up there
and take a look.

11:21.028 --> 11:23.813
- You got it. Let's see.

11:23.944 --> 11:26.120
Oh, Dad, Dad,

11:26.250 --> 11:28.122
this is gonna
look fucking great.

11:28.252 --> 11:29.950
- You bet your ass it is.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.560
And then once we get
this thing painted,

11:31.691 --> 11:33.083
you can be on your way.

11:33.214 --> 11:34.824
- What do you mean,
"on my way"?

11:34.955 --> 11:36.870
- Your cross-country trip.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.175
I mean, just because
Maya's out of the picture,

11:38.306 --> 11:40.308
we're not thinking
about canceling, are we?

11:40.438 --> 11:42.919
Because otherwise, why the hell
have we been out here

11:43.050 --> 11:44.660
busting our hump on this thing?

11:44.791 --> 11:46.793
- Yeah, of course. Hey,
now more than ever, right?

11:46.923 --> 11:48.185
[phone rings]
- Yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:48.316 --> 11:50.144
Before you go anywhere,
let's get a picture.

11:50.274 --> 11:51.798
We're almost
at the finish line, huh?

11:51.928 --> 11:53.321
We're gonna document
this whole thing.

11:53.451 --> 11:54.626
- All right. Say Cougar.

11:54.757 --> 11:56.280
- Cougar.

11:56.411 --> 11:58.674
[phone ringing]

11:58.805 --> 12:00.763
Good work.

12:02.809 --> 12:05.072
- Hello.
- Hey, Jimmy, it's Stacey.

12:05.202 --> 12:06.856
- Oh, hey, Stace.
What's going on?

12:06.987 --> 12:08.553
- I don't know if you know,

12:08.684 --> 12:10.294
but I've been trying
to get back into dancing

12:10.425 --> 12:12.949
and my agents think I need
some new headshots

12:13.080 --> 12:15.169
since my old ones
make me look like

12:15.299 --> 12:18.215
a magician's assistant,
apparently.

12:18.346 --> 12:19.173
And Jill thought
I should give you a call,

12:19.303 --> 12:22.219
so that's why I'm calling.

12:22.350 --> 12:23.786
I mean, I know it's not
really what you do

12:23.917 --> 12:24.918
and you're kind of this,
you know,

12:25.048 --> 12:28.269
international sensation
and all.

12:28.399 --> 12:30.358
But I thought, what the hell?
Doesn't hurt to try.

12:30.488 --> 12:32.795
- Are you kidding me?
I'd be happy to.

12:32.926 --> 12:34.144
Hey, just let me know when.

12:34.275 --> 12:36.756
- I was kinda thinking sooner
rather than later,

12:36.886 --> 12:39.149
like, um...today.

12:39.280 --> 12:42.152
- You know--
[sighs]

12:42.283 --> 12:45.068
Yeah. You know, I--yeah,
I can make that work.

12:45.199 --> 12:46.591
Where are you thinking?

12:46.722 --> 12:48.811
- Well, apparently the lighting
at the apartment

12:48.942 --> 12:52.162
is-is beautiful, so would
you mind coming to the city?

12:52.293 --> 12:53.903
- No, yeah. That'll work.

12:54.034 --> 12:56.079
- Great. We're at 502 Thomas,

12:56.210 --> 12:57.864
a couple of blocks
south of Canal off Varick.

12:57.994 --> 12:59.953
- Okay.
I'll see you in a few hours.

13:00.083 --> 13:02.172
But, um, Stace...

13:04.348 --> 13:05.741
Jill won't be there,
will she?

13:05.872 --> 13:09.266
- Will Jill be here?

13:09.397 --> 13:12.269
Uh, no, you know, she's got
some big interview later today,

13:12.400 --> 13:15.098
but, uh, I'll see
if I can maybe get her

13:15.229 --> 13:17.405
to stick around a little.
No, just kidding.

13:17.535 --> 13:19.755
No, that's not an option.
She'll be busy.

13:19.886 --> 13:23.150
- Uh, okay.

13:23.280 --> 13:25.282
Hey, wish her good luck
for me. I'll see you then.

13:25.413 --> 13:27.067
- See you soon.

13:29.896 --> 13:31.593
You happy now?

13:31.723 --> 13:34.030
- Baby, this is your cause,
not mine.

13:34.161 --> 13:35.640
Stacey Ross with news
at 11:00.

13:35.771 --> 13:37.294
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

13:37.425 --> 13:39.862
- Hey, Pops.
I'm gonna head to the city,

13:39.993 --> 13:41.733
take some pictures
for Stacey.

13:41.864 --> 13:43.126
She needs new headshots.
- Really?

13:43.257 --> 13:44.824
- Is it cool
if I take off for a bit?

13:44.954 --> 13:46.129
- You kidding me? If you're
picking up your camera again.

13:46.260 --> 13:47.739
go right ahead, all right?

13:47.870 --> 13:49.219
Besides, our work
is almost done here, right?

13:49.350 --> 13:50.177
- Cool. Thanks.
I'll see you in a bit.

13:50.307 --> 13:51.787
- All right.
- Okay, you two.

13:51.918 --> 13:53.223
I decided I'll play you
a little bit of the song,

13:53.354 --> 13:54.921
but I don't want any applause

13:55.051 --> 13:56.313
and I don't want to hear
any criticism.

13:56.444 --> 13:57.967
I just need to hear it
out loud for myself, okay?

13:58.098 --> 13:59.229
- Are you shitting me?
This is great news.

13:59.360 --> 14:00.927
Jimbo,
we are in for a treat.

14:01.057 --> 14:02.493
Let me get you a chair,
young lady.

14:02.624 --> 14:05.018
- Oh, please.
Don't make it a whole thing.

14:08.195 --> 14:09.849
- Here we go.
This is very exciting.

14:09.979 --> 14:12.286
Very exciting. All right.

14:12.416 --> 14:14.462
- And it's not done yet.
I'm just gonna play you

14:14.592 --> 14:16.333
the first verse
and the chorus, okay?

14:19.946 --> 14:23.340
[mellow chords]

14:23.471 --> 14:26.909
♪ Larry was afraid,
he thought he had it made ♪

14:27.040 --> 14:28.258

15:04.077 --> 15:05.426
That's all I've got so far.

15:05.556 --> 15:07.384
I'm not finished with
the chorus yet, so that's...

15:07.515 --> 15:09.604
- Okay, I'm gonna cry,
first of all,

15:09.734 --> 15:10.692
'cause it's so beautiful.

15:10.822 --> 15:12.215
- Dad.

15:12.346 --> 15:13.913
- All right, I got a question.
My question is,

15:14.043 --> 15:16.350
are we allowed to make
a comment or ask any questions?

15:16.480 --> 15:19.875
- Tread carefully, because
you tread on my dreams.

15:20.006 --> 15:22.922
- Okay. Well, in that case,
I just--

15:23.052 --> 15:24.967
and I'm not blowing smoke
because you're my daughter,

15:25.098 --> 15:27.274
but hands down, the best song
you've ever written,

15:27.404 --> 15:29.363
the most beautiful song
you've ever written,

15:29.493 --> 15:31.060
even though we only heard
that little piece of it.

15:31.191 --> 15:33.367
- Yea. No, I like it too.

15:33.497 --> 15:34.455
But are you sure
it's not about me?

15:34.585 --> 15:36.936
'Cause it kinda
seems like it is.

15:37.066 --> 15:39.808
You know, the whole she's long
gone and he misses her bits.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.985
- Okay. So as to avoid
any confusion in the future,

15:43.116 --> 15:44.508
I did not write this song

15:44.639 --> 15:47.424
and I will not write any song
ever about you, okay?

15:47.555 --> 15:49.731
- Okay. Well, then
who's this Larry guy?

15:49.861 --> 15:52.386
- Dad, Jesus.
He's just--he's nobody.

15:52.516 --> 15:55.041
He's just a fucking character.
Larry.

15:55.171 --> 15:56.216
- Look, can I ask you
a question too?

15:56.346 --> 15:57.957
Don't get pissed.

15:58.087 --> 15:59.915
- What is it?

16:00.046 --> 16:01.786
- Are you gonna sing this one
or will Lizzie sing it?

16:01.917 --> 16:03.223
- Why would I sing it?

16:03.353 --> 16:04.267
Lizzie's the singer.
I just write the songs.

16:04.398 --> 16:05.921
- Yeah, I kinda get

16:06.052 --> 16:07.401
what Jimmy's
saying though, you know?

16:07.531 --> 16:10.447
Because your voice sounded
really nice in that song.

16:10.578 --> 16:12.754
Not that Lizzie doesn't have
a nice voice, too, but you know,

16:12.884 --> 16:14.234
I mean, it might be
something to consider.

16:14.364 --> 16:16.584
- No, that is not how it works
in bands, okay?

16:16.714 --> 16:18.934
We're not the Beatles
or Fleetwood Mac.

16:19.065 --> 16:20.283
We have one singer.

16:20.414 --> 16:22.285
- Whoa. Okay.
So do the Rolling Stones.

16:22.416 --> 16:24.635
But what, sometimes Keith
will sing lead, right?

16:24.766 --> 16:26.028
Like on "Happy"
or "Before They Make Me Run."

16:26.159 --> 16:27.682
Maybe it could be like that.

16:27.812 --> 16:30.163
- Yeah. Well, we are not the
fucking Rolling Stones, okay?

16:30.293 --> 16:34.167
- Okay, I get it. But humor me
for 30 fucking seconds.

16:34.297 --> 16:35.429
If the choice was yours,

16:35.559 --> 16:37.126
would you sing it
instead of Lizzie?

16:37.257 --> 16:39.389
- I don't know. Maybe.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.348
But I'm not
even gonna think about that

16:41.478 --> 16:43.306
because we don't do ballads,
so it's a moot point.

16:43.437 --> 16:45.004
- Why don't you do ballads?
I love ballads.

16:45.134 --> 16:46.527
Who doesn't like a ballad?

16:46.657 --> 16:48.094
- Great. I love that
you love ballads, Dad.

16:48.224 --> 16:50.531
But Lizzie created the band,
and she's the lead singer

16:50.661 --> 16:52.620
and she doesn't like ballads,
so end of the story.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.230
- Yeah,
that's a shame, Genie,

16:54.361 --> 16:56.015
'cause
it's a really great song.

16:57.625 --> 16:59.105
- And for what it's worth,

16:59.235 --> 17:01.281
I kind of liked it
a little better

17:01.411 --> 17:03.326
when it was about Jimmy
and not this Larry guy.

17:03.457 --> 17:05.111
- Holy fucking Christmas.

17:05.241 --> 17:06.764
Dad, it was never
about Jimmy, okay?

17:06.895 --> 17:08.288
You know what?
Forget it.

17:08.418 --> 17:10.551
This is why
I never play anything for yous.

17:10.681 --> 17:12.074
God!

17:13.423 --> 17:14.685

it's about you.

17:14.816 --> 17:16.774
- Definitely about me.

17:17.732 --> 17:20.691
- Nicky, come on. This is
an incredible opportunity.

17:20.822 --> 17:22.563
I mean, they don't want me
to just do an interview.

17:22.693 --> 17:24.260
They want me to write
a whole fucking book.

17:24.391 --> 17:25.566
I mean,
how can I say no to that?

17:25.696 --> 17:29.222
- Because they're called
Bad Company for a reason.

17:29.352 --> 17:31.485
And 'cause you're gonna be gone
for a whole year on the road

17:31.615 --> 17:33.487
with a bunch of rock stars,
you know,

17:33.617 --> 17:36.359
going to backstage parties
and late-night hotel hangouts

17:36.490 --> 17:38.274
where they do drugs
and have orgies

17:38.405 --> 17:39.928
and all the shit
you read about.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.148
- Well, you're not gonna read
about any of that shit

17:42.278 --> 17:45.064
in my book
because I write about music.

17:45.194 --> 17:46.369
Remember? That's what I do?

17:46.500 --> 17:48.067
- Yeah.

17:48.197 --> 17:51.331
Well, what about your hot shit
music lawyer ex-boyfriend?

17:51.461 --> 17:52.680
He's their attorney, right?

17:52.810 --> 17:54.508
Won't he be there
the whole time?

17:56.510 --> 17:58.860
- His name is Mark, and yes,
I'm sure he'll be there

17:58.990 --> 18:01.515
for some of the days,
but not all of them.

18:01.645 --> 18:03.473
- And you gotta leave
tomorrow?

18:04.605 --> 18:06.389
- I promise I will be back

18:06.520 --> 18:09.088
every few weeks in between
the legs of the tour.

18:15.616 --> 18:17.574

but the only thing

18:17.705 --> 18:20.621
I heard from that sentence
was "between the legs."

your face before I left.

I gotta go.

when I see you.

Bring it home.

over here by the bar.

let me get set up.

a smoke from you?

do anything around here

the phones?

order lunch.

Sometimes I have to make
a dinner reservation.

Where'd you go to school?

20:01.896 --> 20:04.290
Parsons, RISD?

20:04.420 --> 20:07.031
- No. Long Beach.

20:07.162 --> 20:08.163
High school.

20:08.294 --> 20:11.253

20:12.254 --> 20:14.648
- No smoking. Kidding. Ha!
You must be Jill.

20:14.778 --> 20:17.477

immediately.

How are you?

20:19.783 --> 20:21.394
- Hi, Mrs. LaRusso.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

20:21.524 --> 20:22.873
- No, no, no.

20:23.004 --> 20:25.049

not Mrs. LaRusso.

Honey, she called me.

she's the same.

a good time with her.

and we'll take the headshot?

- Yeah, you kidding me?

And I-I-I was really happy
to hear you're dancing again.

20:57.952 --> 21:00.868
- Yeah, the guy that I'm seeing
got me a great new agent,

21:00.998 --> 21:02.609
and I've already had
some big auditions

21:02.739 --> 21:04.350
for some really big parts.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.482
- Really? That's awesome.
Like what?

21:06.613 --> 21:08.571
- I had an audition
for the Solid Gold Dancers.

21:08.702 --> 21:10.486
And if you can believe it,
I got a callback.

21:10.617 --> 21:14.621
Can you fucking imagine,
Jimmy, me on TV?

21:14.751 --> 21:16.405
- Yeah, I can fucking
imagine it,

21:16.536 --> 21:17.711
'cause out of all the people
we grew up with,

21:17.841 --> 21:21.584
if anyone was destined
to be a star, it's you.

21:23.804 --> 21:25.545
- Nice.

21:25.675 --> 21:28.156
And so this new boyfriend
help you with all this?

21:28.287 --> 21:29.897
- No, he is not my boyfriend.

21:30.027 --> 21:31.725
He is just this guy
that I'm seeing.

21:31.855 --> 21:33.988
And to be completely honest
with you,

21:34.118 --> 21:35.772
I'm not really sure how much
longer that's gonna last.

21:35.903 --> 21:37.208
- Why is that?

21:37.339 --> 21:40.951
- Well, for one, he's, like,
a really good guy.

21:41.082 --> 21:42.866
That's not really something
that I'm used to.

21:42.997 --> 21:44.825
- Take it from me.

21:44.955 --> 21:48.176
Might not be the worst thing
in the world for you, Stacey.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.483
- Yeah, I know. I know.

21:50.613 --> 21:53.486
I just don't really understand
why he's so into me, you know?

21:53.616 --> 21:54.748
I mean, why does he want

21:54.878 --> 21:57.446
to spend every second
of every day together?

21:57.577 --> 21:59.318
I mean, he spent
every night here this week.

21:59.448 --> 22:00.667
It's too fucking much,
Jimmy.

and take it easy.

big audition tomorrow and all.

22:27.476 --> 22:28.738

22:28.869 --> 22:29.609
Well, I could just
come over to yours

22:29.739 --> 22:31.350
and take it easy with you.

22:31.480 --> 22:33.700
- Yeah, I think I just need
a night to myself.

22:33.830 --> 22:34.744
- Why? Is something wrong?

22:34.875 --> 22:36.833
- No, nothing's wrong.

22:36.964 --> 22:39.836
It's just that we spent
every night together this week.

22:39.967 --> 22:41.664
- Yeah, it's been
fucking amazing, right?

22:41.795 --> 22:43.449
- Yeah, it's been fun,

22:43.579 --> 22:44.841
but it's also moving
a little fast,

22:44.972 --> 22:46.452

comfortable

22:46.582 --> 22:47.844

moving a bit slower.

22:47.975 --> 22:49.585

Or I could just meet you

22:49.716 --> 22:50.804
at yours in the morning

22:50.934 --> 22:52.893
and then walk you
to your audition.

23:13.827 --> 23:15.959
At least that's
what your mother told me.

23:16.090 --> 23:18.266

I have been having a good time,

23:18.397 --> 23:20.877

for jobs, working freelance.

23:21.008 --> 23:22.488

you went to FIT.

23:41.071 --> 23:43.813

23:43.944 --> 23:47.382
I spoke to
some of your former employers

23:47.513 --> 23:50.559

that you are very talented,

You have an attitude problem.

on your shoulder.

24:01.004 --> 24:02.615

Care to explain yourself?

24:02.745 --> 24:05.313
- Yeah. Okay.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.620
If I'm honest, I do think
I'm better than that stuff.

24:07.750 --> 24:10.013
I'm sorry.
I know how that sounds,

24:10.144 --> 24:11.972

I need an opportunity

I am about what I do, okay?

All that other stuff,

I don't think it makes me
a better designer.

a great secretary,

I'm a designer.

24:27.727 --> 24:32.427

I-I am. It's all I think about.

25:35.882 --> 25:37.448
- Congratulations.

25:37.579 --> 25:38.841
- Stacey: Oh my God.
- Can you believe it?

25:38.972 --> 25:40.103
- I'm proud of you.

25:40.234 --> 25:42.628
- I am so proud of you.
- Thank you.

25:42.758 --> 25:44.630
- Give me this.
Give me some glasses.

25:44.760 --> 25:45.979
- Okay.
Hey, is Luke coming over?

25:46.109 --> 25:47.633
He should celebrate with us.

25:47.763 --> 25:49.460
- No, he's waiting for me
at the Odeon,

25:49.591 --> 25:51.637
which is why
I can only stay for one drink.

25:51.767 --> 25:53.769
- Tell Jill your plan.
- What?

25:53.900 --> 25:55.641
- [sighs]
I'm breaking up with him.

25:55.771 --> 25:57.643
- What? Why?

25:57.773 --> 25:59.514
You were just saying
how amazing he is,

25:59.645 --> 26:02.996
what a great guy he is,
what a huge heart he has.

26:03.126 --> 26:04.867
- Yeah, but that's just it,
you know?

26:04.998 --> 26:06.042
It's a little too good
to be true.

26:06.173 --> 26:07.653
I don't trust it.

26:07.783 --> 26:09.002
- That makes no fucking
sense, Stace.

26:09.132 --> 26:10.612
- She doesn't trust
happiness.

26:10.743 --> 26:12.483
- Hmm.
- No, that's not it.

26:12.614 --> 26:14.703
I don't trust his kindness.

26:14.834 --> 26:16.836
- Okay. Okay.

26:16.966 --> 26:20.796
So let me just--let me just get
this straight so I'm clear.

26:20.927 --> 26:22.624
You're going to break up
with a great guy

26:22.755 --> 26:26.628
who's clearly crazy
about you

26:26.759 --> 26:29.718
because he's a great guy
who's clearly...

26:29.849 --> 26:31.590
crazy about you.

26:33.809 --> 26:36.899
- Imagine that.
I know, I'm terrible.

26:37.030 --> 26:41.077
Anyway, I wanna make a toast,
all right?

26:41.208 --> 26:44.472
To Jill and the dream job.

26:44.603 --> 26:47.910
- Jill and the dream job.
- Mm-hmm. Can't believe it.

26:48.041 --> 26:49.216
- I can.
- Me either.

26:49.346 --> 26:51.261
- Yeah.
- Here you go, Stace.

26:51.392 --> 26:53.002
- To Jill.
- To Jill.

26:53.133 --> 26:54.090

to break another heart,

27:07.713 --> 27:10.280
but, uh...

27:10.411 --> 27:12.413
you sure it's safe
to leave you two here alone?

27:12.543 --> 27:14.807

that can happen?

27:14.937 --> 27:17.026

Well, okay.
Have fun, kids.
