WEBVTT

00:22.789 --> 00:26.125
(snoring)

00:26.127 --> 00:28.994
Chief, there's a sniper down
in the warehouse district!

00:28.996 --> 00:30.829
Let's roll!
Sniper?

00:30.831 --> 00:33.832
Ah, um, well, you know
how I love to roll,

00:33.834 --> 00:37.469
but, uh, my wife ordered a new
dust ruffle for our bedroom,

00:37.471 --> 00:39.638
and, uh, she had it shipped
to the station.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.640
If I'm not here to sign for it,
they'll take it back

00:41.642 --> 00:44.710
to the package place,
and that is a whole nightmare.

00:48.481 --> 00:49.548
Love you guys.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.617
(sighs)

00:58.992 --> 01:01.493
(grunts)

01:01.495 --> 01:03.996
(sighs)

01:03.998 --> 01:07.699
Uh, yeah, I got a delivery
here for, uh, Clancy Wiggins.

01:07.701 --> 01:08.700
"Wiggins"?

01:08.702 --> 01:10.169
N-N-No, it's Wiggum.

01:10.171 --> 01:12.004
Wiggins? That's not
even a real name.

01:12.006 --> 01:13.005
What's a Wiggins?

01:13.007 --> 01:14.006
No, really, tell me.

01:14.008 --> 01:15.207
Wh-What is that?

01:15.209 --> 01:17.543
Okay, so you're not
Clancy Wiggins

01:17.545 --> 01:21.513
who ordered this, uh,
Skymaster X5000 Jet Pack.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.882
Jet pack?

01:23.884 --> 01:25.717
Of course I'm Clancy Wiggins,
you idiot!

01:25.719 --> 01:28.253
"Chief Clancy...
Jetpack."

01:30.356 --> 01:32.591
Wow.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.927
Well, boys,
justice has a new name--

01:34.929 --> 01:36.361
up.

01:36.363 --> 01:37.763
Uh, Chief, it says here

01:37.765 --> 01:39.765
you need to take
a 40-hour training course

01:39.767 --> 01:41.834
and get certified
before you can legally...

01:43.770 --> 01:46.205
I'm not the police anymore.

01:46.207 --> 01:48.207
I'm the Sky Police.

01:48.209 --> 01:50.209
(grunts)

01:50.211 --> 01:51.610
Okay, okay.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.112
I think I got it.

02:00.587 --> 02:03.422
No, I got it,
I got it.

02:03.424 --> 02:05.924

What, so you can steal it

02:37.758 --> 02:39.258
Oh, no. No way.

02:39.260 --> 02:42.995
I'm Brigadier General
Clancy Wiggins.

02:42.997 --> 02:45.631
Apparently
a military-issue jet pack

02:45.633 --> 02:47.633
was mistakenly delivered here

02:47.635 --> 02:50.669
while I received
this off-brand dust ruffle.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.771
Um...

02:52.773 --> 02:53.972
oh.

02:53.974 --> 02:56.508
Well, there's only one
floating future cop

02:56.510 --> 02:58.343
who can find
that missing jet pack--

02:58.345 --> 03:00.012
the Sky Police.

03:06.986 --> 03:11.823
♪ This is the end
of Sky Police. ♪

03:11.825 --> 03:13.926
(screams)

03:15.295 --> 03:18.430
You were the wind
beneath my ass.

03:29.842 --> 03:31.476
Stupid church.

03:31.478 --> 03:33.478
Why would Jesus want us
to waste our weekend

03:33.480 --> 03:35.881
on extra boring, no-recess,
dress-up school?

03:35.883 --> 03:37.316
Exactly.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.984
The dude was
a carpenter.

03:38.986 --> 03:41.553
And those guys like to
kick back on Sundays.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.554
(chuckles)

03:42.556 --> 03:43.989
And I mean kick back.

03:43.991 --> 03:46.992
Guys, church is good
for your souls.

03:46.994 --> 03:49.995
And remember, God is
listening to your prayers.

03:49.997 --> 03:52.331
What percentage of prayers
really come true?

03:52.333 --> 03:54.700
Well, not all of them.

03:54.702 --> 03:57.169
Like, um, 90%?

03:57.171 --> 03:58.704
God doesn't hear my prayers.

03:58.706 --> 04:01.173
If he did, I'd be at home
on the couch playing video games

04:01.175 --> 04:03.008
in a diaper.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.676
Oh, God gets your prayers,

04:04.678 --> 04:06.678
but he just clicks delete
without reading them,

04:06.680 --> 04:09.248
like e-mail updates
from LinkedIn.

04:11.050 --> 04:13.051
I hope no one was hurt.

04:13.053 --> 04:15.053
So no church?

04:15.055 --> 04:17.122
(gasps)
My prayers <i>were</i> answered.

04:22.028 --> 04:23.729
(sighs)
Boom.

04:23.731 --> 04:26.732
Don't worry, Reverend,
according to your policy,

04:26.734 --> 04:30.369
your church is covered for
everything but acts of God.

04:30.371 --> 04:31.870
But we believe

04:31.872 --> 04:34.873
everything that happens
everywhere is an act of God.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.942
My jiminy,
you're right!

04:36.944 --> 04:39.044
We're off the hook!
Hey!

04:39.046 --> 04:41.046
Those Cornell men at the
head office are gonna

04:41.048 --> 04:43.448
be doing the Saluki
Strut tonight!

04:43.450 --> 04:45.450
Go Southern Illinois!

04:45.452 --> 04:47.519
ALL:
Saluki Strut!

04:52.592 --> 04:56.061
So we have no money
to repair the church.

04:56.063 --> 04:58.764
And developers are itching
to build on our land.

04:58.766 --> 05:01.233
Fast-casual dining downstairs,

05:01.235 --> 05:02.801
live-work lofts upstairs,

05:02.803 --> 05:04.736
and as an anchor store--

05:04.738 --> 05:06.738
a chain pharmacy.

05:06.740 --> 05:07.939
(gasping)

05:07.941 --> 05:10.409
Why, it's a mixed-use nightmare!

05:10.411 --> 05:13.412
This building is the
heart of our community.

05:13.414 --> 05:16.415
We have our weddings
here, our funerals.

05:16.417 --> 05:19.418
Our fun runs begin
and end here.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.953
I will not rest
until it is rebuilt.

05:21.955 --> 05:23.789
I can't believe it,

05:23.791 --> 05:27.225
but the church is going to have
to ask people for money.

05:31.764 --> 05:34.766
Who keeps putting
pickle slices in here?

05:34.768 --> 05:37.669
I think I can help you get
the money that you need.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.504
But you don't go
to our church.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.940
Granted, I do not
share your faith,

05:41.942 --> 05:44.943
but the yahoos in this town
need a church

05:44.945 --> 05:48.613
to deliver weekly reminders
not to steal-- from me.

05:48.615 --> 05:50.949
And not to take
a life-- my life.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.951
Yar, without
organized religion,

05:52.953 --> 05:54.519
I've lost me
moral compass.

05:54.521 --> 05:57.456
Also I've, uh, I've
been addicted to Oxy

05:57.458 --> 05:59.991
for a while
now... yar.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.993
Yar.

06:01.995 --> 06:04.196
Now, this is what
I have got in mind.

06:04.198 --> 06:06.631
I will whisper
even though we are alone.

06:06.633 --> 06:09.634
All right, people,
Marge has brought this heathen

06:09.636 --> 06:12.337
to aid us
in our time of need.

06:12.339 --> 06:13.972
Please do not
call me a heathen.

06:13.974 --> 06:16.808
It offends Hanuman,
the monkey-headed lord of winds,

06:16.810 --> 06:19.811
who believed the sun
to be a ripe mango...

06:19.813 --> 06:21.713
Okay, I get it,
I get why you say it.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.149
Apu thinks
we can get the money

06:24.151 --> 06:26.852
at the casino
playing blackjack.

06:26.854 --> 06:27.853
(gasping)

06:27.855 --> 06:29.321
The casino?!

06:29.323 --> 06:31.189
Blackjack's
for suckers.

06:31.191 --> 06:32.491
My brother?

06:32.493 --> 06:35.193
He used to own
three Arby's franchises.

06:35.195 --> 06:37.195
Lost 'em all at the tables

06:37.197 --> 06:40.198
and gave himself
a shotgun tonsillectomy.

06:40.200 --> 06:43.201
But you told me Uncle
Stevie moved to Okinawa.

06:43.203 --> 06:46.838
What I told you was
to wait in the car.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.840
No, no, you can
beat the house.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.208
By counting cards.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.743
I myself have done it--

06:51.745 --> 06:53.879
when I was a student at MIT,

06:53.881 --> 06:57.516
<i>the Mumbai Institute</i>
<i>of Tantric Sex,</i>

06:57.518 --> 07:00.018
<i>where I was recruited</i>
<i>by a card-counting ring.</i>

07:00.020 --> 07:02.521
<i>I won enough money</i>
<i>to buy fake SAT scores</i>

07:02.523 --> 07:04.689
<i>I used to get</i>
<i>into the real MIT,</i>

07:04.691 --> 07:07.526
<i>where I failed every class</i>
<i>and was kicked out</i>

07:07.528 --> 07:09.227
and had to move to Springfield.

07:09.229 --> 07:10.228
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.

07:10.230 --> 07:11.530
Am I hearing
this right?

07:11.532 --> 07:14.699
Is the church council
truly considering gambling?

07:14.701 --> 07:16.201
You know, Ned,

07:16.203 --> 07:19.204
the Bible never explicitly
condemns gambling.

07:19.206 --> 07:22.607
Biblical folks were always
playing games of chance,

07:22.609 --> 07:25.043
like, uh,
drawing lots.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.044
(gasps)

07:26.046 --> 07:27.245
Leviticus drew lots.

07:27.247 --> 07:28.880
Joshua drew
lots, Nehemiah.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.882
Even the apostles
were lot-drawers.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.884
(gasps)
If gambling's okay,

07:32.886 --> 07:35.420
then I'm getting health
insurance for the kids.

07:35.422 --> 07:36.888
Card counting is not gambling.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.056
It is math.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.891
And it's not even
against the rules.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.726
Exactly.

07:41.728 --> 07:44.729
If you are caught, you cannot
be charged with any crime.

07:44.731 --> 07:47.299
The worst they will do is
beat you with a phone book

07:47.301 --> 07:48.600
or break some fingers.

07:48.602 --> 07:50.602
But what is a little pain

07:50.604 --> 07:52.904
if your church is to be saved?

07:52.906 --> 07:54.873
It is all good.

07:59.645 --> 08:02.314
Counting cards requires
absolute focus.

08:02.316 --> 08:05.317
You must ignore
all casino distractions.

08:05.319 --> 08:07.419
(slot machines ringing
over stereo)

08:07.421 --> 08:09.955
(all coughing)

08:09.957 --> 08:11.957
And beware
of cocktail waitresses

08:11.959 --> 08:14.426
with free drinks
and eyeball-height cleavage.

08:14.428 --> 08:17.596
They're not attractive,
but you cannot look away.

08:17.598 --> 08:18.797
Freshen your drink,
hon?

08:18.799 --> 08:20.265
Who had the Scotch
and soda?

08:20.267 --> 08:22.167
Cocktails. Cocktails.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.269
Another one, hon?
You, what is the count?!

08:24.271 --> 08:27.172
(stammers)

08:27.174 --> 08:29.441
Get your head
in the game, Mel!

08:29.443 --> 08:33.111
Now remember, for this legal-
but-frowned-upon scheme to work,

08:33.113 --> 08:35.113
we must have complete secrecy.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.649
Do not tell anyone
what you are doing.

08:37.651 --> 08:39.117
Not even Homer?

08:39.119 --> 08:41.019
(sighs)
Homer is many things

08:41.021 --> 08:42.988
but not
a good accomplice.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.457
If he gets involved
and this scheme fails,

08:45.459 --> 08:47.392
what happens to our church?

08:50.463 --> 08:52.531
(dance music plays)

08:53.966 --> 08:54.966
(all groan)

08:54.968 --> 08:57.002
Oh, even I saw that.

08:57.004 --> 08:59.204
I guess I can't tell Homer.

09:00.473 --> 09:03.141
I'm leaving for my
fund-raising meeting.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.509
Don't wait up.

09:04.511 --> 09:07.145
Why are you church-os getting
together so late?

09:07.147 --> 09:10.215
I'm asking because I'm supposed
to care about things.

09:10.217 --> 09:13.218
Well, to raise money, we're...

09:13.220 --> 09:14.986
putting on a revue.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.988
Well, you can't go wrong
with a revue.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.390
Skits and songs?

09:18.392 --> 09:19.658
(chuckles)

09:19.660 --> 09:21.493
I'm entertained
already.

09:21.495 --> 09:23.061
Yeah, so, uh...

09:23.063 --> 09:24.863
I'm going out
to rehearse...

09:24.865 --> 09:25.864
the revue.

09:25.866 --> 09:26.865
Go.

09:26.867 --> 09:27.866
Go make magic.

09:27.868 --> 09:28.867
You just go.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.335
(chuckles)

09:30.337 --> 09:31.636
Revue.

09:42.014 --> 09:43.848
APU:
<i>Card counting is simple.</i>

09:43.850 --> 09:46.217
<i>All sit at different tables,</i>
<i>betting low,</i>

09:46.219 --> 09:47.852
<i>playing hand after hand,</i>

09:47.854 --> 09:50.422
<i>counting in your head</i>
<i>how many high cards</i>

09:50.424 --> 09:52.424
<i>are left in the deck.</i>

09:53.693 --> 09:55.193
<i>Ignore all distractions.</i>

09:55.195 --> 09:57.796
(stammering)

10:01.100 --> 10:04.035
<i>When the count is high,</i>
<i>you have a "hot deck,"</i>

10:04.037 --> 10:05.870
and the odds are in your favor.

10:05.872 --> 10:09.874
<i>Then you use a secret signal</i>
<i>to call in "the Closer."</i>

10:09.876 --> 10:12.544
<i>The Closer bets big,</i>
<i>wins bigger,</i>

10:12.546 --> 10:16.414
<i>and the casino never suspects</i>
<i>that it has been the victim</i>

10:16.416 --> 10:19.384
<i>of a morally acceptable</i>
<i>screw job.</i>

10:19.386 --> 10:22.387
<i>But use caution--</i>
<i>there are eyes everywhere.</i>

10:22.389 --> 10:25.757
<i>Sooner or later,</i>
<i>the casino will catch on.</i>

10:25.759 --> 10:29.294
And that is when you must flash
the "get the hell out" signal.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.641
LOVEJOY:
<i>What a haul.</i>

10:43.743 --> 10:44.743
MARGE:
Ooh.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.144
One more night
like this,

10:46.146 --> 10:48.647
and we'll be able
to fix the church in style.

10:50.249 --> 10:52.250
What a rush-- it got
my blood pumping

10:52.252 --> 10:54.819
in a way I thought
only quiet reflection could.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.454
Fizzy water
for everyone.

10:56.456 --> 11:00.492
I think we can do something
a little harder than that.

11:02.595 --> 11:03.962
Mmm!

11:03.964 --> 11:08.400
Now, that's a marshmallow-y
s'more-garita.

11:09.635 --> 11:12.837
Homer, Homer,
we did it.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.973
(mumbling):
Wh-What'd you do?

11:14.975 --> 11:16.975
We're going to
save the church.

11:16.977 --> 11:19.477
I feel like
celebrating.

11:19.479 --> 11:21.746
B-But... but it's not
on the calendar.

11:22.982 --> 11:25.617
Okay, but if I'm sleepy
at work tomorrow,

11:25.619 --> 11:27.686
I get to tell
everyone why.

11:28.954 --> 11:30.121
<i>Oh, boy, oh, boy.</i>

11:30.123 --> 11:33.458
1:00 a.m. loving
and 2:00 a.m. steak?

11:33.460 --> 11:35.794
Night-marriage rules!

11:35.796 --> 11:37.128
(sighs)

11:37.130 --> 11:38.530
I guess nothing gets
the heart pumping

11:38.532 --> 11:39.798
like a church revue.

11:39.800 --> 11:40.799
Huh?

11:40.801 --> 11:41.800
Oh, yeah.

11:41.802 --> 11:42.867
Yeah, yeah,
the revue.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.869
Oh, I got so
many questions.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.471
What are the
skits about?

11:46.473 --> 11:49.474
Uh, pop culture
and current events.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.643
How do you transition
between scenes?

11:51.645 --> 11:53.845
Hard blackouts or
spotlight fades?

11:53.847 --> 11:56.047
Uh, both.
Nice.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.049
You know, it wouldn't be
a revue without songs.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.484
Tell me about one.

11:59.486 --> 12:03.054
Okay, uh, there's
a song about, um...

12:03.056 --> 12:07.058
how Democrats and Republicans
can't get along.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.928
It's called,
"Cats and Dogs."

12:15.668 --> 12:17.068
(laughing):
Oh.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.370
You got yourself
one hell of a show, Marge.

12:19.372 --> 12:21.906
One hell of a show.

12:23.843 --> 12:25.510
(sighs)

12:25.512 --> 12:27.846
Okay, okay,
don't get cocky,

12:27.848 --> 12:29.848
you rapture-waiting
baby-baptizers.

12:29.850 --> 12:33.218
You had one good night,
but now the casino is on to you.

12:33.220 --> 12:34.686
They're not going to let you

12:34.688 --> 12:37.756
anywhere near
those blackjack tables,

12:37.758 --> 12:39.424
unless you wear these.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.859
MARGE:
Disguises?

12:40.861 --> 12:43.528
I'm worried our scam
is becoming dishonest.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.530
Relax, Marge.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.899
If God lets the Jews have
Sunday on a Saturday,

12:47.901 --> 12:49.367
he'll be cool
with this.

12:49.369 --> 12:51.369
Why, I bet the Lord
is pleased as punch

12:51.371 --> 12:52.937
that we're using
that dirty casino money

12:52.939 --> 12:54.572
to rebuild his temple.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.574
Our mission is
100% pure.

12:56.576 --> 12:58.810
LOVEJOY:
Where has this been all my life?

13:00.045 --> 13:01.212
(Helen and Mrs. Skinner moan)

13:01.214 --> 13:04.883
I could be Sideshow...
anyone.

13:04.885 --> 13:07.218
I'm telling Mom about how
the school freezer broke,

13:07.220 --> 13:09.053
and they had to cook
all the Tater Tots,

13:09.055 --> 13:11.222
and the teachers took the extra
Tots home in manila envelopes.

13:11.224 --> 13:12.223
I'm telling her!

13:12.225 --> 13:13.892
You never let me tell.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.593
Mom,
the freezer broke and...

13:15.595 --> 13:16.895
Cooked all the
Tater Tots,
Cooked all
the Tater Tots.

13:16.897 --> 13:19.063
and there were
manila envelopes,
Manila envelopes.

13:19.065 --> 13:20.064
and the teachers
took them home...

13:20.066 --> 13:21.065
BOTH:
I hate you!

13:21.067 --> 13:22.133
MARGE:
Okay, Mel.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.768
I'll be at the casino
by 10:00.

13:23.770 --> 13:26.838
Meet me at the lounge
by the J. Geils cover band.

13:28.073 --> 13:30.475
Mom, why are you
going to a casino?

13:30.477 --> 13:33.144
Are you...
a hostess?

13:33.146 --> 13:37.148
Actually, my friends and I
are using a system

13:37.150 --> 13:39.617
to win money to save the church.

13:39.619 --> 13:42.120
I can't believe
you're gambling.

13:42.122 --> 13:43.755
It's not gambling.

13:43.757 --> 13:44.956
It's math.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.591
Is Dad in on this takedown?

13:46.593 --> 13:48.593
It's not a takedown.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.995
And I haven't told him
about it. Yet.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.431
But it's okay
for you guys to know

13:53.433 --> 13:55.433
because you're finally
grown-up enough

13:55.435 --> 13:58.603
to be trusted
with adult information.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.271
Yeah, we are grown-up.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.273
I know how much
to tip a waiter.

14:02.275 --> 14:03.641
I go on hikes
with my friends

14:03.643 --> 14:05.109
where we talk
about our problems.

14:05.111 --> 14:06.945
I'll tell your dad
everything

14:06.947 --> 14:08.513
in the morning
when we have the money.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.515
But until then,
I appreciate

14:10.517 --> 14:14.185
you keeping this very
grown-up secret.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.254
(sighs)

14:17.623 --> 14:20.191
♪

14:46.151 --> 14:47.986
Dump that money
on the bed.

14:47.988 --> 14:50.054
I'm taking
a Franklin bath.

14:53.993 --> 14:55.994
(imitates gargles, laughs)

14:55.996 --> 14:57.896
Yeah...

14:59.498 --> 15:01.900
Dear Lord, thank you
for granting us the gift

15:01.902 --> 15:05.536
of rationalization to allow us
to scheme and swindle

15:05.538 --> 15:07.005
so that we might honor you.

15:07.007 --> 15:08.206
Amen.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.540
MARGE:
<i>Homie.</i>

15:09.542 --> 15:11.175
Homie, I can finally tell you

15:11.177 --> 15:13.177

(chuckles)

15:13.179 --> 15:14.579
Homie?

15:14.581 --> 15:16.547
(phone rings)

15:16.549 --> 15:17.882
Uh, Marge?

15:17.884 --> 15:19.684
Some casino guys have me,

15:19.686 --> 15:21.686
and they want the money
you took from them or else.

15:21.688 --> 15:22.687
(gasps)

15:22.689 --> 15:24.389
This is all my fault.

15:24.391 --> 15:26.591
Just tell me one thing, Marge.

15:26.593 --> 15:29.060
Why did you lose faith
in the revue?

15:29.062 --> 15:31.529
I mean, "Cats and Dogs"
writes itself.

15:31.531 --> 15:34.098
♪ Cats and dogs
on Capitol Hill ♪

15:34.100 --> 15:36.601

15:48.714 --> 15:50.915
Homie, how did you end up
at the casino?

15:50.917 --> 15:52.550
Well, I was taking a moment

15:52.552 --> 15:54.619
to enjoy my after-dinner
night cap...

15:56.588 --> 15:59.057
Dad, Mom trusted
us with a secret.

15:59.059 --> 16:00.425
But she hasn't
come home yet,

16:00.427 --> 16:02.226
and we're worried
she's in trouble.

16:02.228 --> 16:03.628
(burping):
What?!

16:03.630 --> 16:06.264
BOTH: Mom's counting
cards at the casino!

16:06.266 --> 16:08.266
Oh, if anything
happens to Marge,

16:08.268 --> 16:10.234
(gasps) we'll all
be orphans!

16:10.236 --> 16:11.569
(gasping)

16:11.571 --> 16:13.471
<i>I'm coming for you, baby.</i>

16:13.473 --> 16:14.739
Have you seen
this woman?

16:14.741 --> 16:15.740
Have you?

16:15.742 --> 16:17.008
Have you seen my wife?

16:17.910 --> 16:19.143
This is your wife?

16:19.145 --> 16:20.578
Do you know where she is?

16:20.580 --> 16:23.414
Uh, we'd like to ask you
some questions

16:23.416 --> 16:24.816
in our "beating room."

16:24.818 --> 16:28.753
All right, as long as
it's just questions.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.321
Reverend! Reverend!

16:30.323 --> 16:32.323
They took Homer!

16:32.325 --> 16:34.325
Why are you still
dressed like that?

16:34.327 --> 16:36.761
Um, well...
(chuckles nervously)

16:36.763 --> 16:39.297
HELEN:
Oh, Asphodel...

16:39.299 --> 16:42.000
Your corpse bride
is getting cold.

16:42.002 --> 16:44.002
Uh, one second,
Belladonna.

16:44.004 --> 16:45.636
Helen and I have found
that, uh,

16:45.638 --> 16:48.606
these new personas have
been quite liberating.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.608
Was that
a woman's voice?

16:50.610 --> 16:52.176
Send her in.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.945
(throws up)

16:53.947 --> 16:56.781
If we don't give back the
money we won counting cards,

16:56.783 --> 16:59.350
the casino people are
going to hurt Homer.

16:59.352 --> 17:00.785
Okay, uh...

17:00.787 --> 17:02.453
Tiny snafu.

17:02.455 --> 17:05.456
I've already given the money
to the contractor.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.458
Then we'll just have
to ask that contractor

17:07.460 --> 17:08.826
to give the
money back.

17:08.828 --> 17:10.461
(laughs)

17:10.463 --> 17:11.863
Give the money back?

17:11.865 --> 17:13.865
(laughs)

17:13.867 --> 17:16.868
Hey, Jerry, th-they want
the money back.

17:16.870 --> 17:19.871
<i>La dama azul quiere</i>
<i>devolver el dinero.</i>

17:19.873 --> 17:21.939
(all laughing)

17:24.376 --> 17:26.377
Are you gonna put
my head in a vice?

17:26.379 --> 17:28.646
We don't do that--
we don't even have a vice.

17:28.648 --> 17:31.816
We just want the money
your wife stole from us.

17:31.818 --> 17:34.152
Stole? How is
counting cards stealing?

17:34.154 --> 17:36.354
Well, it's not really stealing.

17:36.356 --> 17:37.722
Is it even cheating?

17:37.724 --> 17:40.324
No, but it's just not allowed.

17:40.326 --> 17:41.893
I don't get it.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.528
Football players can do
the quarterback sneak

17:43.530 --> 17:45.530
and baseball players
can steal bases.

17:45.532 --> 17:47.532
Why can't I just remember
which cards have been played?

17:47.534 --> 17:49.200
I can't take any more
of this guy.

17:49.202 --> 17:50.201
Get the vice!

17:50.203 --> 17:51.669
I knew you had a vice.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.037
I knew it.

17:53.039 --> 17:54.672
(grunting):
I knew it.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.774
I... knew it.

17:58.177 --> 17:59.844
I'm sorry, Marge.

17:59.846 --> 18:03.414
Maybe your husband's suffering
was all part of God's plan.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.183
God's plan?

18:05.185 --> 18:08.186
God isn't some video gamer
up there controlling us

18:08.188 --> 18:11.022
like we were Pac-Men
and Dig Dugs.

18:11.024 --> 18:13.224
God isn't Sky Police.

18:13.226 --> 18:14.859
God didn't do this.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.694
I lied to my husband.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.529
And made my kids lie, too.

18:18.531 --> 18:19.864
We did this.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.199
She's right.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.201
We thought we could
enter the den of sin

18:23.203 --> 18:24.202
and emerge unscathed,

18:24.204 --> 18:25.770
but we were scathed.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.406
Those free ginger
ales at the casino,

18:28.408 --> 18:31.409
I-I didn't declare
them on my taxes.

18:31.411 --> 18:32.743
(grunts)

18:32.745 --> 18:34.212
I'm going to do

18:34.214 --> 18:36.581
what I should have done
in the first place.

18:36.583 --> 18:39.250
Put on a revue?

18:39.252 --> 18:40.384
(grunts)

18:40.386 --> 18:41.919
(groans)

18:41.921 --> 18:44.922
MARGE: <i>Dear Lord, I don't have</i>
<i>anywhere to pray anymore,</i>

18:44.924 --> 18:47.925
<i>so I've come</i>
<i>to your new temple-- here.</i>

18:47.927 --> 18:50.928
<i>Um, I don't know if you watch</i>
<i>us all the time,</i>

18:50.930 --> 18:53.931
<i>or if we're just like an ant</i>
<i>farm you got for your birthday</i>

18:53.933 --> 18:56.567
<i>and left on the shelf,</i>
<i>and every once in a while,</i>

18:56.569 --> 18:59.570
<i>you check out what kind</i>
<i>of crazy tunnels we've built.</i>

18:59.572 --> 19:01.572
<i>Maybe we got it all wrong,</i>

19:01.574 --> 19:04.142
<i>praying for you to give us</i>
<i>things we selfishly want.</i>

19:04.144 --> 19:08.146
<i>Maybe prayer is just taking</i>
<i>a moment to tell yourself</i>

19:08.148 --> 19:10.414
<i>that there is good</i>
<i>in the universe.</i>

19:10.416 --> 19:13.818
<i>And I'm going to sit here</i>
<i>and focus on that good,</i>

19:13.820 --> 19:17.855
<i>and maybe, just maybe,</i>
<i>I'll get my husband back.</i>

19:26.298 --> 19:28.299
(gasps)

19:28.301 --> 19:29.767
I'm Doug Blattner,

19:29.769 --> 19:31.302
COO of the gaming
and resorts division

19:31.304 --> 19:33.171
of Stuffers
Italian Foods.

19:33.173 --> 19:36.340
My family loves your
microwave lasagnas.

19:36.342 --> 19:39.343
It's not my division, but I'll
tell Bill Kelley you said so.

19:39.345 --> 19:41.779
Your unsanctioned religious
gathering has caused

19:41.781 --> 19:44.182
a marked decrease
in gambling activities.

19:44.184 --> 19:46.817
HPMs are down...
that's hands per minute.

19:46.819 --> 19:50.288
IAMs, GDCs--
they're all down.

19:50.290 --> 19:52.290
I want my
husband back.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.292
Hmm, let me run it
by Jennifer Yang.

19:54.294 --> 19:56.294
Oh, wait, she's
on maternity leave.

19:56.296 --> 19:59.197
Don't worry-- I'm sure Chuck
Bennett will sign off on it.

20:00.465 --> 20:02.466
We are going
to release your husband.

20:02.468 --> 20:05.836
See, Marge, someone up in the
sky did hear your prayers.

20:05.838 --> 20:09.340
They sure did--
casino management.

20:09.342 --> 20:10.808
(grunts)

20:10.810 --> 20:12.810
You are free to leave

20:12.812 --> 20:15.379
as long as your faith-based
card-counting group

20:15.381 --> 20:19.483
never return to this or any
other river or maritime casino.

20:19.485 --> 20:22.320
No deal!
But we don't need
to come back.

We saved the church.

20:24.157 --> 20:27.725
No! An injustice has gone on
here for too long!

20:27.727 --> 20:29.727
I'm not leaving this casino

20:29.729 --> 20:32.897
until you stop punishing people
for counting cards.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.899
They're just playing the game

20:34.901 --> 20:36.534
by the rules.

20:36.536 --> 20:39.003

20:42.841 --> 20:46.510
Homie, after all this, do
you still believe in God?

20:46.512 --> 20:49.080
On a beautiful night
like tonight,

20:49.082 --> 20:51.249
how could I not?
