01:17.202 --> 01:20.705
That's our target.
As soon as it docks, we go.

01:35.887 --> 01:39.933
- Are you sure this is going to work?
- Trust me.

02:03.414 --> 02:04.874
Good tip, earthling.

02:16.928 --> 02:18.596
Follow me.

02:23.268 --> 02:26.312
This shaft will take you
directly above the bridge.

02:26.396 --> 02:27.605
Thank you, brother.

02:27.689 --> 02:30.984
The Archivist is taking
too long to start the ceremony.

02:31.484 --> 02:32.569
The Archivist?

02:33.820 --> 02:34.821
Hurry.

02:36.364 --> 02:40.076
If he waits much longer,
the empire will descend into chaos.

02:45.123 --> 02:46.916
Make ready for takeoff.

02:54.299 --> 02:57.677
I'm telling you, Branko's
wanton attack was only the beginning.

02:57.760 --> 03:00.305
Without an emperor,
more and more high-ranking officials

03:00.388 --> 03:04.183
will start lashing out and consolidating
their power at the Kral Zera.

03:04.267 --> 03:07.562
Uh, just gonna jump in here.
What exactly is the Kral Zera?

03:07.645 --> 03:10.356
Is there food there?
It sounds awful fancy.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.902
It's the coronation ceremony
for a new emperor or empress.

03:13.985 --> 03:18.698
It is held on one of the first planets we,
the Galra, conquered.

03:18.781 --> 03:20.742
Planet Feyiv, a sacred land.

03:21.326 --> 03:24.996
Okay, so who all will be
at this Kral Zera?

03:25.079 --> 03:26.706
Allow me to show you.

03:27.206 --> 03:30.126
-May I, Princess?
-Go ahead.

03:32.253 --> 03:35.840
Warlord Ranveig is one
of the fiercest Galra in the empire.

03:35.924 --> 03:38.718
That's why my father sent him
to the fringes of the universe.

03:39.302 --> 03:42.263
He will already have several factions
pledging their allegiance.

03:42.347 --> 03:43.598
Warlord, huh?

03:43.681 --> 03:46.392
I'm guessing you don't get that title
by being nice.

03:47.352 --> 03:50.521
Commander Gnov was one
of Zarkon's most trusted advisors.

03:51.105 --> 03:54.234
She will be unifying
Zarkon's inner circle of commanders.

03:54.317 --> 03:55.985
They know what they'll get with her.

03:56.069 --> 04:00.156
She's not as reckless as Warlord Ranveig,
but she's just as cruel.

04:00.740 --> 04:01.866
Quartermaster Janka.

04:01.950 --> 04:05.328
He is responsible for overseeing
supply routes throughout the empire.

04:05.870 --> 04:07.288
Don't let his stature fool you.

04:07.372 --> 04:10.541
His power is bureaucracy,
and he should not be underestimated.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.502
He keeps popping up in my database.

04:12.585 --> 04:16.255
His supply chain management
is incredible. He definitely color codes.

04:17.089 --> 04:20.551
So, organized evil. Okay.

04:20.635 --> 04:22.971
And, finally, Zarkon's witch Haggar.

04:24.806 --> 04:25.807
We've met.

04:27.141 --> 04:29.143
She's most dangerous
of them all.

04:29.227 --> 04:32.063
Because she's not Galra,
and therefore not eligible to rule,

04:32.146 --> 04:33.982
she probably has a puppet already.

04:34.065 --> 04:36.401
Someone she can control and manipulate.

04:36.484 --> 04:39.904
If the Galra were smart,
they'd be working together against her.

04:39.988 --> 04:41.406
If Haggar's puppet takes over,

04:41.489 --> 04:44.659
then stopping Zarkon's reign
will all have been for naught.

04:44.742 --> 04:47.370
Then we can't risk any
of them assuming control.

04:48.579 --> 04:51.541
We should help Lotor take command
of the Galra Empire.

04:52.375 --> 04:56.379
Shiro, we've already discussed this.
It's far too risky.

04:56.462 --> 05:00.967
Yeah, why don't we let them fight amongst
themselves a while before we do anything?

05:01.050 --> 05:02.969
You know what we went through on Olkarion,

05:03.052 --> 05:05.722
that was just one rogue commander vying
for the throne.

05:05.805 --> 05:09.309
When the Galra lash out,
everyone in the universe suffers.

05:09.392 --> 05:12.437
How would we even get Lotor there
without stirring up a huge fight?

05:13.187 --> 05:14.647
I'll be bringing Voltron.

05:16.649 --> 05:19.819
Yeah, because Voltron
never gets in fights.

05:19.902 --> 05:22.613
Shiro, we can't allow that to happen.

05:26.951 --> 05:28.619
I'm sorry to hear that.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.546
Uh, what's up with Shiro?

05:50.516 --> 05:52.852
The Archivist
has made the summons.

05:52.935 --> 05:55.021
Set a course for planet Feyiv.

05:55.605 --> 05:59.609
It is time for me to burn
with the glory of the Kral Zera

05:59.692 --> 06:02.570
and take my place on the Galra throne.

06:03.446 --> 06:06.616
Kral Zera? Planet Feyiv?
What's going on?

06:07.325 --> 06:11.204
This is our time to strike.
We will bring the Galra Empire down.

06:55.081 --> 06:58.292
Avert your gaze.
The throne is for real fighters.

06:59.335 --> 07:02.046
I've conquered more worlds
than you've ever seen

07:02.130 --> 07:04.799
with just the swipe of my finger.

07:14.016 --> 07:15.977
All right, when we get down there,

07:16.060 --> 07:18.438
set one explosive
on each load-bearing beam.

07:30.074 --> 07:31.200
The Archivist.

07:32.910 --> 07:38.875
Through 33 rulers, during times of peace
and times of expanse,

07:38.958 --> 07:42.503
this flame has burned
for over 13 millennia.

07:44.797 --> 07:48.801
From our first, Brodar, to Vrig the Great,

07:48.885 --> 07:52.472
and longest and most powerful of all...

07:52.555 --> 07:54.056
Zarkon.

07:56.058 --> 07:58.436
But his time has passed.

08:01.105 --> 08:02.982
Our next ruler

08:03.065 --> 08:06.068
must ascend the steps of destiny

08:06.152 --> 08:08.613
and relight the Kral Zera.

08:35.181 --> 08:38.683
Fool! Only the strongest
may lay their hands on the torches.

08:39.268 --> 08:41.812
That is why I will assume command.

08:42.313 --> 08:45.441
I have been on the frontlines
of the expanse,

08:45.525 --> 08:50.363
where iron meets soul,
spreading the glory of the empire,

08:50.446 --> 08:54.116
not huddled in the center
overseeing already-conquered worlds,

08:54.200 --> 08:57.161
growing fat on the victories
of our forefathers.

09:04.252 --> 09:06.921
Warlord Ranveig speaks the truth.

09:07.004 --> 09:12.468
That is why Sendak, the purest
of the Galra, should light the flame.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.012
He was Zarkon's right hand for millennia,

09:15.596 --> 09:19.392
and he will lead the empire
for 10,000 more years.

09:21.352 --> 09:23.229
The witch and Sendak.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.732
Perhaps we should put
our differences behind us.

09:26.816 --> 09:30.236
The only way we can stop those two is
by working together.

09:30.319 --> 09:32.697
Why would I partner with the weak?

09:33.739 --> 09:38.619
Sendak, who disappeared
while the empire crumbled?

09:38.703 --> 09:43.124
Sendak, who needs a witch
to speak on his behalf?

09:43.207 --> 09:46.627
Enough! Victory or death!

09:46.711 --> 09:49.422
Now you will know why Zarkon put me

09:49.505 --> 09:53.175
in the most dangerous territory
in the universe.

10:45.936 --> 10:47.605
Hunk, what are you doing?

10:47.688 --> 10:50.024
Why are you single-modulating
the gendocam?

10:50.107 --> 10:53.527
Settle down, Pidge.
It's a gendocam, not a vlexagane, okay?

10:53.611 --> 10:55.404
Single-modulation is fine.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.199
You should double-modulate everything.

10:58.282 --> 11:01.661
Are you crazy?
That's a waste of a button-press.

11:01.744 --> 11:02.953
Sorry to interrupt.

11:03.037 --> 11:06.666
Hey, Dad, real quick.
How do you reconfigure a gendocam?

11:06.749 --> 11:08.084
Oh, great question.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.461
Well, you start off
by double-modulating--

11:10.544 --> 11:12.588
A-ha! I told you!

11:12.713 --> 11:14.840
Ah.

11:14.924 --> 11:18.344
Modulating arguments.
That's how your mother and I met.

11:19.887 --> 11:22.723
Anyway, have either of you seen Shiro?

11:22.807 --> 11:26.602
I wanna go over my report for the Galaxy
Garrison one last time before I leave.

11:27.144 --> 11:29.397
Haven't seen him
since he stormed off the bridge.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.525
I've never seen him like that.
That was weird.

11:32.608 --> 11:35.236
It was almost as weird
as double-modulating.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.533
Hey, Princess,
do you know where Shiro is?

11:40.616 --> 11:41.617
Let me check.

11:44.578 --> 11:47.915
He isn't on the ship.
His lion's gone, too.

11:48.416 --> 11:49.959
Where's Lotor?

11:57.299 --> 11:58.884
You are defeated.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.887
The empire is mine.

12:10.396 --> 12:13.274
Activating timers on the explosives.

12:28.414 --> 12:32.293
I will strengthen the empire,
as no one else can.

12:32.376 --> 12:33.711
Stop!

12:34.295 --> 12:37.923
You cannot light the torch
without facing my blades.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.049
Shiro.

13:20.758 --> 13:24.553
Ilun, Vrek, we have to stop!
Shiro is out there!

13:25.137 --> 13:28.140
It's too late. My bombs
are armed and the timer is set.

13:28.224 --> 13:29.892
The operation is a go.

13:37.733 --> 13:38.901
Lotor.

13:40.778 --> 13:43.614
Halt! Your true emperor has arrived.

13:57.711 --> 14:01.048
You? Lead the Galra Empire?

14:01.590 --> 14:05.719
What could possibly make you think
that you could be our emperor?

14:06.303 --> 14:09.515
My father's blood is not just
in my veins.

14:10.641 --> 14:12.309
It's also on my sword.

14:13.143 --> 14:17.439
The emperor fell to me
and so will anyone that stands in my way.

14:17.523 --> 14:21.694
You think treachery makes you qualified
to lead us?

14:21.777 --> 14:25.531
I will light the flame,
not for defeating my father

14:25.614 --> 14:28.868
and not even for being
the strongest Galra here.

14:29.702 --> 14:33.455
But because I did something
no one else could do.

14:35.457 --> 14:38.168
I return the Black Lion to the Galra.

14:39.795 --> 14:41.964
Stand aside, Sendak.

14:52.516 --> 14:56.687
Time to prove yourself
through honorable rite of combat.

14:56.770 --> 15:00.024
- No, time to end this.
- Enough!

15:00.107 --> 15:03.569
Lotor, you cannot lead the Galra.

15:03.652 --> 15:06.405
You think you can stop me, witch?

15:06.989 --> 15:11.493
The blood that so bolsters your claim
is also what quells it.

15:12.077 --> 15:16.081
You are not full Galra.
You are a half-breed.

15:16.165 --> 15:18.125
Your mother was Honerva.

15:18.208 --> 15:22.922
Everyone here knows my lineage,
but that will not keep me from the throne.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.936
Now I'm taking what's rightfully mine.

15:37.019 --> 15:40.356
I am lighting that flame,
and my first act as emperor

15:40.439 --> 15:43.067
will be to reunite you
with my late father!

15:43.150 --> 15:46.320
You're not getting to the top
of these steps!

15:53.160 --> 15:55.371
What are you doing?
We have to go!

15:55.788 --> 15:58.123
No! Shiro and Lotor are up there!

15:58.916 --> 16:00.584
Then you'll die with them.

16:20.521 --> 16:23.232
You don't even know
what you are, Sendak.

16:23.816 --> 16:27.569
So loyal, so brave, and yet so stupid.

16:27.653 --> 16:31.782
I know exactly what I am. I am a warrior!

16:34.660 --> 16:36.912
You are nothing but Haggar's puppet!

16:58.350 --> 17:00.978
There's too many.
There's not enough time.

17:28.005 --> 17:30.132
Lotor has betrayed us to Voltron!

17:30.215 --> 17:32.301
Fire on the Black Lion!

17:39.308 --> 17:41.018
I gotta draw their fire.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.376
Commander Trugg's fleet
has opened fire!

18:06.960 --> 18:08.837
Watch out for their left flank!

18:09.546 --> 18:12.216
-Return fire immediately!
-Fire on Gnov!

18:34.321 --> 18:38.283
This is exactly what I wanted to avoid.
I knew they would all turn on each other.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.636
Killing you would be too merciful.

18:57.719 --> 19:01.807
Once I'm emperor,
I'm going to keep you as my slave!

19:28.792 --> 19:33.005
-Should we get Sendak?
-Leave him. The empire has fallen.

19:39.595 --> 19:42.639
There's too many.
I can't handle them all myself.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.475
Huh?

19:48.145 --> 19:50.189
Looks like you could use some help!

19:54.651 --> 19:56.778
We got your back, Shiro!

19:56.862 --> 19:59.948
Okay, team. Let's form Voltron!

21:05.806 --> 21:07.516
- Huh?
- Sendak!

21:37.587 --> 21:42.009
Sendak, I-- We could work together.
Brains and brawn.

21:42.092 --> 21:43.552
A joint rulership.

21:43.635 --> 21:46.805
Stronger than any the empire
has ever seen.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.808
Your fleet is mine.

21:50.559 --> 21:53.687
No!

22:34.936 --> 22:37.022
The flame is lit.

22:37.814 --> 22:39.858
Bow to your emperor.
