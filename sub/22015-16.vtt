00:06.340 --> 00:06.507
.

00:06.540 --> 00:07.441
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:08.576 --> 00:10.111
sexually based offenses

00:10.144 --> 00:11.512
are considered
especially heinous.

00:11.545 --> 00:14.148
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.182 --> 00:16.050
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.084 --> 00:17.351
are members of an elite squad

00:17.385 --> 00:19.520
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.155
These are their stories.

00:22.490 --> 00:24.158
- Keep making buzzer beaters
like that,

00:24.192 --> 00:25.659
and you'll be playing
for the Liberty.

00:25.693 --> 00:26.794
- I wish.

00:26.827 --> 00:28.629
Remember that game
against Dallas?

00:28.662 --> 00:30.731
- Tina Charles finds Zellous in
the corner with five seconds.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.133
Zellous launches a three,

00:32.166 --> 00:34.235
and swish, the Liberty win.

00:34.268 --> 00:37.338
- Lily,
we're not on the court anymore.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.073
We're not on the court anymore.

00:39.107 --> 00:40.341
- She's such a dork.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.410
- Yeah, I'm so sick
of this stupid game.

00:42.443 --> 00:44.145
- You weren't sick of it
on my turn.

00:44.178 --> 00:45.413
- Day's officially over
anyway, so.

00:45.446 --> 00:47.281
- Hey, not until your mom
picks you up.

00:47.315 --> 00:50.184
And actually,
it's that time again.

00:50.218 --> 00:52.186
- No, guys, no.

00:52.220 --> 00:53.721
- Eww.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.389
Which guy?

00:55.423 --> 00:58.692
There.

00:58.726 --> 01:01.495
- You have to go over there
and--right over there.

01:01.529 --> 01:02.796
- No, no.

01:02.830 --> 01:05.399
- You have to do it, Zoe.

01:05.433 --> 01:06.834
- Fine,
but then I'm done, right?

01:06.867 --> 01:10.104
- Maybe, if you
don't die of humiliation.

01:11.805 --> 01:13.407
- Okay.

01:17.211 --> 01:20.348
- Oh, my God,
she is actually doing it.

01:20.381 --> 01:22.516
- Literally
the best day of my life.

01:26.687 --> 01:29.190
- Hi.

01:29.223 --> 01:30.524
both: Red Parrot!

01:30.558 --> 01:31.525
- Red Parrot!

01:31.559 --> 01:33.494
- Red Parrot!

01:38.499 --> 01:40.734
- Lily, Lisa,
have you girls seen Zoe?

01:40.768 --> 01:43.137
- Not since we got off
the bus after the game.

01:43.171 --> 01:44.705
- She's not answering
her cell phone.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.540
- Maybe the battery died.

01:50.378 --> 01:52.346
- I've run this sports center
for 20 years.

01:52.380 --> 01:53.614
This has never happened.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.349
- This place have
security cameras?

01:55.383 --> 01:57.385
- It's not in the budget.

01:57.418 --> 01:58.886
- According to her friends,
she never returned

01:58.919 --> 02:01.289
to the Rec Center when
the bus pulled up after a game.

02:02.456 --> 02:05.859
- Yes,
and we called in their parents.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.228
These are detectives.

02:07.261 --> 02:09.263
They need to talk
to Lily and Lisa.

02:09.297 --> 02:12.400
- So, you two were
the last ones to see Zoe?

02:12.433 --> 02:15.203
- Mm-hmm.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.772
- Lily,
we have to tell the truth.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.241
- That's right, young lady.

02:20.274 --> 02:21.909
- Nothing.

02:21.942 --> 02:25.346
- Lisa.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.615
- Okay, ladies, listen to me.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.650
You're not in trouble,
all right?

02:29.683 --> 02:32.586
We just--we just need
to know what happened.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.922
so we can find Zoe.

02:34.955 --> 02:38.292
She's your friend, right?

02:38.326 --> 02:41.462
So just take a breath
and tell me what happened.

02:45.266 --> 02:47.768
- So when we got off the bus,

02:47.801 --> 02:50.671
we dared her to kiss
some rando on the street.

02:50.704 --> 02:51.705
- A man.

02:59.447 --> 03:00.981
- Zoe went over to him,

03:01.014 --> 03:03.317
then we went inside.

03:03.351 --> 03:05.386
Now she's gone.

03:16.664 --> 03:23.704
*

04:00.841 --> 04:02.376
You Zoe's basketball coach?

04:02.410 --> 04:04.011
- Please tell me you found her.
- Not yet,

04:04.044 --> 04:06.514
but we do have a few questions.
- This is my worst nightmare.

04:06.547 --> 04:09.049
- It's a tough job, a lot
of kids to be responsible for.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.651
We're sure you do your best.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.486
- Can you describe the man
that Zoe approached

04:12.520 --> 04:14.955
after she got off the bus?

04:16.724 --> 04:19.560
- No, and I'm almost certain
I accounted for everyone when--

04:20.928 --> 04:22.363
- I always do a head count,

04:22.396 --> 04:25.299
but maybe it was
when we got on the bus.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.672
- Where was Zoe
the last time you saw her?

04:31.705 --> 04:33.607
- Right over there
with the man.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.779
- He had light brown skin,
like, Indian, maybe?

04:38.812 --> 04:40.748
Was it short

04:40.781 --> 04:41.949
What color was it?

04:41.982 --> 04:43.551
- I couldn't tell
because of his helmet.

04:44.585 --> 04:45.919
So, he had a bike?

04:45.953 --> 04:47.555
- Yeah,
the ones you could rent.

04:47.588 --> 04:49.022
He was taking it
out of the rack.

04:49.056 --> 04:51.825
- Okay, and which dock
was he taking it out of?

04:51.859 --> 04:52.960
- Right at the end.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.562
- Yeah, the very first one.

04:54.595 --> 04:56.063
- BikeNYC's
got digital docking.

04:56.096 --> 04:58.599
They'll have
his name and address.

04:58.632 --> 04:59.833
Thank you.

05:01.902 --> 05:04.004
David Gidumal.
Police.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.108
- If Zoe's in there,
exigent circumstances,

05:08.141 --> 05:09.877
right, Counselor?

05:09.910 --> 05:12.079
- Right about here.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.455
- Clear.

05:25.693 --> 05:26.727
- Clear.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.083
Oh, we got lucky.

05:50.117 --> 05:53.020
The guy's got a Find My Phone
app on his computer.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.689
Let's see.

06:00.127 --> 06:03.797
It says...

06:03.831 --> 06:08.135
He should be here.

06:09.903 --> 06:10.971
- Stop.
- NYPD.

06:12.139 --> 06:13.774
- Y-yeah,
what are you doing here?

06:15.509 --> 06:17.678
- The girl!

06:17.711 --> 06:18.646
- She's missing.

06:18.679 --> 06:21.782
And she was last seen
with you.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.551
- You think--wait.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.853
I was taking out a bike,
and she tapped my shoulder.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.756
I turned around and she kissed
me on the cheek and ran away.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.658
Her friends shouted,
"Red Parrot."

06:30.691 --> 06:32.926
- I was as confused as you are.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.564
- She ran away with
her friends, giggling.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.065
Then they went
into the Rec Center.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.601
- Now hold on,
you're absolutely sure

06:40.634 --> 06:42.636
you saw all three of them
go inside?

06:42.670 --> 06:43.671
- Positive.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.439
- All right,
you're gonna have to

06:45.473 --> 06:46.674
come with us until we
can confirm your story.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.542
- My door--
I can't leave it like this.

06:48.576 --> 06:50.210
- Call a locksmith; the
Department will reimburse you.

06:50.243 --> 06:53.013
- Hey, Loo.
Yeah, the bike guy checks out,

06:53.046 --> 06:55.449
and if he's telling the truth,
we're thinking Zoe might

06:55.483 --> 06:56.784
still be in the Rec Center.

06:56.817 --> 06:59.086
- I want a grid search--
every storage room,

06:59.119 --> 07:02.055
every utility space,
every office checked

07:02.089 --> 07:04.592
top to bottom.
Go.

07:10.798 --> 07:12.500
- Okay,
she's gotta be here somewhere.

07:13.934 --> 07:17.170
- Kids don't go anywhere
without their cell phones.

07:31.118 --> 07:33.186
Zoe?

07:48.769 --> 07:50.671
Zoe?

08:02.916 --> 08:04.885
I need some help in here!

08:04.918 --> 08:07.487
Fin, get up to the gym
immediately.

08:12.259 --> 08:14.795
Help me out.
Over here.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.864
- Okay, move all this stuff
out the way.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.098
Get it out of here.

08:20.934 --> 08:23.070
Zoe?

08:23.103 --> 08:27.307
Can you hear me, honey

08:27.340 --> 08:29.042
- Okay, somebody call a bus!

08:29.076 --> 08:30.911
- Stay with me, Zoe, I got you.
They're on their way.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.813
Help is on the way,
okay, honey?

08:32.846 --> 08:34.648
Honey, stay with me.

08:34.682 --> 08:37.685
Stay with me,
Zoe, stay with me.

08:41.288 --> 08:41.789
.

08:41.822 --> 08:42.690
- So they're taking her
to Mercy Hospital.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.759
It's one of the best
pediatric ICUs in the city.

08:45.793 --> 08:47.227
One of you can ride with Zoe.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.029
- This officer will take you
and follow the ambulance.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.565
- I will, oh, my God.
- Thank you.

08:53.266 --> 08:54.802
- We don't know at this point.

08:54.835 --> 08:56.570
- You have any idea
why she was in the gym?

08:56.604 --> 08:57.671
- She wasn't supposed
to be in there.

08:57.705 --> 08:58.972
The girls were told to change,

08:59.006 --> 09:00.574
get what they need
from their lockers,

09:00.608 --> 09:02.976
and wait by the front door
for their pick-ups.

09:03.010 --> 09:05.345
Okay,
go with him, please.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.648
- Uh, we'll see.

09:08.816 --> 09:11.151
- Not according to the EMTs.

09:11.184 --> 09:13.053
- So--so she was here
the entire time

09:13.086 --> 09:15.322
her two friends
told us otherwise?

09:15.355 --> 09:16.824
- Take them in.

09:16.857 --> 09:19.593
I wanna see if they know
why and how Zoe ended up

09:19.627 --> 09:23.363
in her underwear, unconscious,
behind those bleachers.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.833
- Listen, Lily,

09:25.866 --> 09:28.869
what happened is in the past--
that's done.

09:28.902 --> 09:29.937
But you can make up
for it right now

09:29.970 --> 09:31.138
by telling me the truth.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.806
I know that you
didn't wanna hurt Zoe.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.041
I know that.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.809
- How did Zoe fall
under the bleachers?

09:35.843 --> 09:37.745
- It was just a stupid prank.

09:37.778 --> 09:38.946
- Okay.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.347
What was the prank?

09:40.380 --> 09:42.650
- Red Parrot.

09:42.683 --> 09:43.917
Lisa saw it on YouTube.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.886
- I-It's this thing
where for a whole day,

09:45.919 --> 09:49.790
you have to do any dare
your friends tell you to.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.859
Lily went first.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.761
Yesterday was my turn.

09:53.794 --> 09:57.130
- Today was Zoe's day.

09:57.164 --> 10:00.868
First, she had
to spill her soda at lunch.

10:00.901 --> 10:03.103
- Then tell Coach Clare
she had bad breath.

10:03.136 --> 10:05.405
- And then you dared her
to kiss the man on the bike?

10:05.438 --> 10:08.642
- Only on the cheek, though.

10:08.676 --> 10:11.011
- And then when we got back
to the Rec Center to change...

10:11.044 --> 10:14.948
- It was supposed
to be her last dare.

10:14.982 --> 10:17.417
She had to run
a lap around the gym

10:17.450 --> 10:18.986
in her underwear.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.287
- We thought it'd be funny
to throw her clothes up

10:20.320 --> 10:22.990
on the bleachers,
and she started climbing up

10:23.023 --> 10:25.092
to get them, we ran away.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.827
- I didn't know she fell
and hurt her head.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.061
- Lily said if we told somebody

10:28.095 --> 10:31.298
we were pranking her,
we'd get in trouble.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.734
- I'm so sorry.

10:33.767 --> 10:34.868
- It was an accident.

10:34.902 --> 10:37.237
- I wish I never
played that game.

10:37.270 --> 10:41.008
I wish I didn't run away.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.777
I'm really, really sorry.

10:54.454 --> 10:56.323
- Zoe's still in surgery.

10:56.356 --> 10:59.259
They're trying to relieve
the pressure in her brain.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.795
It's been hours,
and we haven't heard anything.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.764
- Is there anything
that we can get you?

11:03.797 --> 11:05.165
- No.

11:05.198 --> 11:07.367
Maybe just say
a prayer for her?

11:07.400 --> 11:08.836
- Yes, of course.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.904
Do you know yet?

11:10.938 --> 11:12.906
- We talked to Lisa
and Lily again.

11:12.940 --> 11:16.109
Let's just say it was
a prank gone wrong.

11:16.143 --> 11:17.177
- Oh, my God.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.913
- It was an accident, and...

11:19.947 --> 11:22.816
The girls are remorseful,

11:22.850 --> 11:24.852
to say the least.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.854
- Mr. and Mrs. Bergkamp--

11:26.887 --> 11:29.089
can we talk privately
for a moment?

11:36.196 --> 11:40.400
- That's never a good sign.

11:52.012 --> 11:53.781
- I don't understand, Doctor.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.082
I was so hopeful.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.284
When I found Zoe, she was--
she was breathing.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.452
- The impact caused
cerebral edema--

11:59.486 --> 12:00.854
brain swelling.

12:00.888 --> 12:02.355
We tried to relieve
the pressure

12:02.389 --> 12:04.825
by fenestration with
a burr hole into the skull,

12:04.858 --> 12:06.994
but the swelling
was too severe.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.128
She died during surgery.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.963
- Damn.
- And if...

12:09.997 --> 12:11.364
We had found her earlier?

12:11.398 --> 12:13.366
- I doubt it would've
made a difference.

12:13.400 --> 12:18.471
I'm sure the M.E. will declare
manner of death accidental.

12:18.505 --> 12:20.974
If you'll excuse me.

12:24.477 --> 12:26.246
- Hey, Rollins,
when you were a kid,

12:26.279 --> 12:28.816
what was the dumbest thing
you ever did?

12:28.849 --> 12:30.317
Me and Stevie Harris

12:30.350 --> 12:32.953
used to steal
our dads' .22s and go

12:32.986 --> 12:36.256
shoot cans off a stump,
and one day,

12:36.289 --> 12:38.191
I-I dared him to go
down to the stump

12:38.225 --> 12:40.994
and just hold the can
an arm's length out.

12:41.028 --> 12:43.230
Dead-eye Amanda
shoots a bullet hole

12:43.263 --> 12:44.898
right through the sleeve
of his sweatshirt.

12:44.932 --> 12:45.999
- You know what,
remind me never to go

12:46.033 --> 12:47.300
to the practice range with you.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.102
- Remind me never to
let Jesse leave the house.

12:49.136 --> 12:51.538
- Hey,
any word on your missing kid?

12:51.571 --> 12:54.975
- Lieutenant found her
in the gym, unconscious.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.343
She died a few minutes ago.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.511
- Seems like an accident.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.247
- Two of her little friends
were playing a prank,

13:00.280 --> 13:02.249
and I guess
the poor kid slipped

13:02.282 --> 13:04.184
and fell head first off
the top of the bleachers.

13:04.217 --> 13:06.286
- Is it something we might
wanna refer to Family Court?

13:06.319 --> 13:08.288
- Both the girls already got
kicked out of their sports camp

13:08.321 --> 13:10.157
for not telling the truth
about what happened.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.524
Plus, they have to live with
this the rest of their lives.

13:11.558 --> 13:13.927
- If every 12 year old
were arrested for lying,

13:13.961 --> 13:15.462
you wouldn't wanna see
my rap sheet.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.397
- We can send you our reports
if you wanna pursue this.

13:17.430 --> 13:18.465
- Nah, it's heartbreaking,

13:18.498 --> 13:20.400
but these girls don't sound
like Thelma and Louise.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.202
Seems like the right call.

13:26.573 --> 13:29.309
- Hi.

13:29.342 --> 13:32.212
We just wanted to
offer our condolences.

13:32.245 --> 13:37.517
Detective Tutuola and I
both have kids, and...

13:37.550 --> 13:40.520
We just can't imagine what--
what you're both going through.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.056
- Thanks.

13:43.090 --> 13:47.027
I just wanna walk.

13:47.060 --> 13:48.461
Zoe's ring.

13:48.495 --> 13:51.198
I meant to take it.
It was my mom's.

13:51.231 --> 13:53.934
- Well, we can arrange
to get that back to you.

13:53.967 --> 13:57.938
- No, I would really like
to have it back right now.

13:57.971 --> 13:59.472
- Yeah.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.241
I'll be back.

14:01.274 --> 14:04.144
Come on.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.242
- She had surgery on her head.

14:35.275 --> 14:37.410
Why is there an incision
down to her waist?

14:42.215 --> 14:44.217
When you wake up,

14:44.251 --> 14:46.353
you're gonna feel all better,

14:46.386 --> 14:48.555
and you're gonna get to have
all the Jell-O you want.

14:48.588 --> 14:49.689
What's your favorite flavor?

14:51.424 --> 14:53.060
- Detectives.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.228
I'm with the bravest kid
in New York right now.

14:55.262 --> 14:59.066
- We need to speak with you
ASAP.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.101
- I'll be right back.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.307
What's going on?

15:07.340 --> 15:09.642
- Zoe Bergkamp's incision--
the one on her chest?

15:11.011 --> 15:14.982
- Why'd you cut her open
like that?

15:15.015 --> 15:16.549
- To harvest her organs--

15:16.583 --> 15:21.488
two beautiful kidneys,
a liver, and a heart.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.556
- Did the Bergkamps
sign off on this?

15:23.590 --> 15:26.559
Well, not exactly.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.563
- No.

15:30.597 --> 15:33.967
- Where are the organs
right now?

15:34.001 --> 15:36.369
- The liver and the kidneys
are in refrigeration here.

15:36.403 --> 15:39.606
The heart is on its way
to a hospital in Buffalo.

15:39.639 --> 15:42.009
- Call the driver and
have him turn around now.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.144
- It's actually a helicopter.

15:44.177 --> 15:46.546
It's on the roof.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.481
- Okay, you stay with her.

15:54.354 --> 15:56.489
NYPD!

15:56.523 --> 15:57.657
Stop.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.494
- I need to take custody
of this cooler.

16:01.528 --> 16:04.064
The organ may be
evidence of a crime.

16:04.097 --> 16:05.465
- There's a terminally ill boy

16:05.498 --> 16:08.601
being prepped right now
for a heart transplant.

16:08.635 --> 16:11.004
- He's gonna have
to wait for another one.

16:11.038 --> 16:12.605
- It's a miracle
we have this one.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.641
He's been on the list
for three years.

16:17.144 --> 16:19.612
So we're good to go?

16:19.646 --> 16:21.614
- I don't know, I, uh,

16:21.648 --> 16:23.350
I need more time.

16:23.383 --> 16:24.584
- It's wheels up now,

16:24.617 --> 16:26.386
or this kid's
probably gonna die.

16:36.163 --> 16:36.463
.

16:36.496 --> 16:37.430
- We've--we've located
your daughter's organs,

16:38.798 --> 16:41.101
and they are still
here in the hospital.

16:41.134 --> 16:43.070
- Why'd she take them
without our permission?

16:43.103 --> 16:45.638
- We're gonna address that
at another time,

16:45.672 --> 16:48.375
but--but right now,
we need to make a decision

16:48.408 --> 16:50.443
about--about Zoe's heart.

16:52.612 --> 16:56.583
- It was being harvested
for transplantation.

16:56.616 --> 16:59.786
Right now, there's
a helicopter on the roof

16:59.819 --> 17:02.389
waiting to take it to Buffalo

17:02.422 --> 17:04.557
for a little boy
who's very sick.

17:04.591 --> 17:06.793
- Please tell me
this isn't happening.

17:06.826 --> 17:09.296
- Can we have a few days
to figure this out?

17:09.329 --> 17:11.098
- Unfortunately, no.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.699
Um...

17:12.732 --> 17:16.536
If the helicopter doesn't leave
in the next ten minutes,

17:16.569 --> 17:19.206
then--
then the heart is useless.

17:20.307 --> 17:24.344
- I'm sorry...

17:24.377 --> 17:26.146
Came out wrong.

17:26.179 --> 17:30.683
I'm very sorry that I have to
ask you about this right now,

17:30.717 --> 17:33.786
but you have a chance
to save a little boy's life,

17:33.820 --> 17:37.557
so we need to make a decision.

17:37.590 --> 17:40.360
- Meredith, maybe we should--

17:40.393 --> 17:41.628
- No.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.196
It's just not right.

17:43.230 --> 17:47.300
I mean, I mean, there are
pieces of her missing.

17:47.334 --> 17:51.338
- Okay. Okay.

17:51.371 --> 17:53.606
- Please, Lieutenant,
you're making a huge mistake--

17:53.640 --> 17:54.874
- I wish I had a choice.

17:54.907 --> 17:58.345
- You do.
Just give me the cooler.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.347
I'll say I ignored your orders.

18:00.380 --> 18:01.748
- I can't let you do that.

18:01.781 --> 18:03.450
You'd be committing a crime.

18:03.483 --> 18:04.851
- I promise I'll turn myself in

18:04.884 --> 18:07.454
once I get that heart
to Buffalo.

18:07.487 --> 18:09.856
What if this was your sick kid,

18:09.889 --> 18:14.227
and that was the answer
to all your prayers?

18:14.261 --> 18:19.132
- Liv, maybe you and I
got here too late.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.500
- I can't.

18:20.533 --> 18:22.769
I'm sorry.

18:29.642 --> 18:30.777
- I just don't understand why

18:30.810 --> 18:32.345
this is a matter
for the police.

18:32.379 --> 18:36.249
- And it may not be.
I just wanna get all the facts.

18:42.489 --> 18:43.856
- It's really very simple.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.658
When Zoe Bergkamp hit her head,

18:45.692 --> 18:47.460
her brain swelled
inside her skull.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.829
We did everything we could in
surgery to vent the pressure,

18:49.862 --> 18:52.632
but the fluid was
crushing the brain stem.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.267
That's light's out.

18:54.301 --> 18:57.537
She was pronounced dead
by neurological criteria.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.172
Her heart was beating,

18:59.206 --> 19:00.940
but for all intents
and purposes, she was gone.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.643
That's the textbook
scenario for harvesting,

19:03.676 --> 19:05.478
- So you just
took it upon yourself

19:05.512 --> 19:08.915
to assume that the
parents would consent?

19:08.948 --> 19:10.082
- I did.

19:10.116 --> 19:13.720
- But you didn't even have
a brief conversation with them.

19:13.753 --> 19:16.889
- Truthfully,
I couldn't risk them saying no.

19:16.923 --> 19:18.591
There was another child
to consider,

19:18.625 --> 19:21.328
one that was alive.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.296
- Don't ask, don't tell.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.965
- Because the law says that...

19:25.998 --> 19:28.868
You need explicit consent.

19:28.901 --> 19:29.936
- And the law is wrong.

19:29.969 --> 19:34.374
- That's not for you to decide.

19:34.407 --> 19:38.311
- Would you bend the law
to save a life, Lieutenant?

19:42.315 --> 19:43.950
Right.

19:43.983 --> 19:47.987
You didn't strike me
as an absolutist.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.790
So let's have some respect
for each other.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.859
I could never do what you do.

19:52.892 --> 19:54.694
And I don't think that
you're in any position

19:54.727 --> 19:56.963
to second-guess
my professional judgment.

19:56.996 --> 20:00.667
- You're right.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.735
But it's not my call.

20:02.769 --> 20:03.970
- This doctor admits

20:04.003 --> 20:05.705
she presumed
consent by the parents?

20:05.738 --> 20:08.341
- Well, I don't know if
presumed is the right word.

20:08.375 --> 20:09.776
There was nothing stopping her,

20:09.809 --> 20:12.445
so she cut this girl open
and she harvested her organs.

20:12.479 --> 20:13.713
- An assault charge
isn't viable

20:13.746 --> 20:15.415
if Zoe had been pronounced.

20:15.448 --> 20:16.749
Was there money changing hands?
- Not that I know of.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.452
- Naturally,
they're pretty upset.

20:19.486 --> 20:20.820
- Upset enough to testify
if we filed charges?

20:20.853 --> 20:22.722
- I don't know, Stone,
but my gut is that

20:22.755 --> 20:25.492
this doesn't belong
in criminal court.

20:25.525 --> 20:26.626
- There's probably
a felony here.

20:26.659 --> 20:28.395
- Yeah, that--that I was close

20:28.428 --> 20:29.529
to being an accomplice to.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.731
- You stopped it.

20:31.764 --> 20:36.669
- And I'm still not sure
that I made the right call.

20:36.703 --> 20:38.338
- This isn't about
assuaging your guilt, Olivia?

20:38.371 --> 20:40.039
- Well, that's easy
for you to say, isn't it?

20:40.072 --> 20:41.808
Because you weren't there
to make the call.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.976
- So find out if this was
a one-off lapse of judgment.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.678
I'll hold off on
getting an arrest warrant

20:45.712 --> 20:48.348
until I speak to Zoe's parents.

20:48.381 --> 20:51.651
- Thank you.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.655
- Dr. Franchella's
a hero around here.

20:55.688 --> 20:57.857
I can't tell you how many
lives she's saved.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.926
- How long has she been
in the harvesting business?

20:59.959 --> 21:02.429
- She started sending us
pediatric organs

21:02.462 --> 21:04.297
five, six years ago--

21:04.331 --> 21:05.798
kidneys, livers, hearts.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.300
And you have to understand--

21:07.334 --> 21:09.502
kids' organs are
extremely hard to come by,

21:09.536 --> 21:10.903
especially here in New York.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.372
- And you just accept them,
no questions asked?

21:12.405 --> 21:14.341
- Her paperwork
is always in order.

21:15.241 --> 21:17.777
- Consent forms,
compatibility analyses,

21:17.810 --> 21:19.646
tissue typing, HLA screens.

21:19.679 --> 21:20.980
- We're gonna need
to see all that.

21:21.013 --> 21:24.651
- Wait, is Dr. Franchella
under investigation?

21:24.684 --> 21:25.852
- Actually, yes, she is.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.920
- We can't afford
to lose this doctor.

21:27.954 --> 21:31.057
- We're still gonna
need those records.

21:31.090 --> 21:33.926
We tracked down 35 children
whose organs were harvested

21:33.960 --> 21:35.795
by Dr. Franchella,
but only four families

21:35.828 --> 21:37.830
recall signing
donation consent forms.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.033
- They claimed they
didn't sign anything.

21:41.067 --> 21:43.470
- It wasn't easy telling them
their dead kid's organs

21:43.503 --> 21:44.571
were in somebody else.

21:44.604 --> 21:45.938
- Better you than me.

21:45.972 --> 21:48.375
- Now, even though
the families didn't consent,

21:48.408 --> 21:52.078
there's a completed form
for each kid.

21:52.111 --> 21:53.145
- I'm no expert,

21:53.179 --> 21:56.082
but the handwriting's
the same on all the forms.

21:56.115 --> 21:57.850
- Yeah, look at the sevens.

21:57.884 --> 21:59.719
Every time she uses one
for a date or the time,

21:59.752 --> 22:01.421
it's got a European cross.

22:01.454 --> 22:03.390
- Well, Dr. Franchella studied
at Oxford for two years.

22:03.423 --> 22:05.858
- So she signed
all 31 consent forms.

22:05.892 --> 22:09.429
At a minimum,
that's forgery.

22:11.598 --> 22:12.832
- Thank you for seeing me.

22:12.865 --> 22:15.034
I know it's been
a difficult time.

22:15.067 --> 22:16.836
- We're planning
our daughter's funeral.

22:16.869 --> 22:18.838
Difficult doesn't
begin to cover it.

22:18.871 --> 22:20.807
- Please accept my condolences.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.409
But I do need to loop you in

22:22.442 --> 22:25.077
on our investigation
of Dr. Franchella.

22:28.047 --> 22:29.449
- Can you just tell us
what this is?

22:29.482 --> 22:31.784
I can't look at
anymore paperwork.

22:31.818 --> 22:34.487
- These are organ
donor consent forms--

22:34.521 --> 22:36.856
all of them forged
by Dr. Franchella.

22:36.889 --> 22:37.857
There's 31 of them.

22:39.125 --> 22:41.027
- Yes, and we're considering

22:41.060 --> 22:43.129
filing forgery charges
on behalf of each family.

22:45.164 --> 22:48.435
She cut open
my daughter's chest,

22:48.468 --> 22:50.136
and ripped out her
still-beating heart.

22:50.169 --> 22:51.838
- She never even
gave us a choice.

22:51.871 --> 22:54.741
- And she clearly
violated the law.

22:54.774 --> 22:57.143
But there is
the ethical question

22:57.176 --> 22:59.612
as to whether her actions
may have saved other children.

22:59.646 --> 23:00.980
- Don't.

23:01.013 --> 23:02.882
Just don't.

23:02.915 --> 23:05.418
You think this is ethical?

23:05.452 --> 23:08.521
She stole my child's
body parts.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.423
What gave her
the right to do that?

23:10.457 --> 23:11.524
A medical degree?

23:11.558 --> 23:14.060
- She had no right
to do that to us,

23:14.093 --> 23:15.127
to Zoe.

23:15.161 --> 23:17.497
- You bring your kid
to the hospital

23:17.530 --> 23:21.868
and you expect them
to take care of her.

23:21.901 --> 23:25.705
You trust them with
your precious baby,

23:25.738 --> 23:28.575
and they give her to a vulture.

23:36.516 --> 23:38.050
- The Bergkamps
are pressing charges?

23:38.084 --> 23:39.819
- The Bergkamps are
the least of your problems.

23:39.852 --> 23:41.488
- Do you really need
to use handcuffs?

23:41.521 --> 23:42.922
- Standard procedure.

23:42.955 --> 23:44.190
Please be careful.

23:44.223 --> 23:46.192
Once this nonsense
is cleared up,

23:46.225 --> 23:49.596
there are a lot of children who
are still gonna need my help.

23:53.633 --> 23:53.800
.

23:53.833 --> 23:54.534
- All we have against
Dr. Franchella

23:55.267 --> 23:56.736
are the forgeries.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.505
Did anything turn up
in her financials?

23:58.538 --> 23:59.739
- No,
we've been over it three times.

23:59.772 --> 24:01.474
She didn't take a dime
for any of this.

24:01.508 --> 24:03.643
But she does donate
a sizeable amount to charities.

24:03.676 --> 24:05.211
- Well, what's she looking at
in terms of jail time?

24:05.244 --> 24:06.979
- Seven years, times 32.

24:07.013 --> 24:08.881
- That's a lot of time
over some paperwork.

24:08.915 --> 24:10.783
- And if Zoe's parents
make a victims' statement

24:10.817 --> 24:12.251
after a conviction,
don't be surprised

24:12.284 --> 24:13.986
if she gets double digits
upstate.

24:15.187 --> 24:16.689
- I can't say I blame them.

24:16.723 --> 24:18.024
- I think this woman's
practically a saint,

24:18.057 --> 24:19.859
forgery or not.
- You'd let some doctor

24:19.892 --> 24:21.494
rip your kid's heart out
while--

24:21.528 --> 24:22.929
while it's still
beating in her chest?

24:22.962 --> 24:25.197
- Two separate doctors
declared her brain dead--

24:25.231 --> 24:27.199
- Okay, so--so you're
saying hospital bureaucrats

24:27.233 --> 24:28.935
should get to decide
what parents do

24:28.968 --> 24:30.603
with their dead child's
body parts?

24:30.637 --> 24:31.838
- I'm not saying that.
- I'm with Carisi.

24:31.871 --> 24:33.272
I don't see
what the big deal is.

24:33.305 --> 24:34.874
Dead is dead.

24:34.907 --> 24:36.543
- Everybody has a right
to their own opinion.

24:36.576 --> 24:37.910
But as it stands now,

24:37.944 --> 24:39.546
if you don't have
explicit consent to harvest

24:39.579 --> 24:42.014
a dead child's organs,
it's a felony.

24:47.253 --> 24:49.255
- We were both in shock.

24:49.288 --> 24:53.059
This was the worst day
of our lives.

24:53.092 --> 24:54.694
I-I mean...

24:54.727 --> 24:57.296
One minute, you're...

24:57.329 --> 24:59.966
Kissing your little girl
good-bye in the morning,

24:59.999 --> 25:01.601
and then the next...

25:04.904 --> 25:06.138
- Do you need some time,
Meredith?

25:06.172 --> 25:09.175
- No, no, no.

25:09.208 --> 25:13.179
It's okay.

25:13.212 --> 25:15.715
- People's One
for identification.

25:15.748 --> 25:18.017
Do you recognize this
organ donor authorization?

25:18.050 --> 25:22.321
- That's my name,
but it's not my handwriting.

25:22.354 --> 25:25.257
And that is not my signature.

25:25.291 --> 25:27.660
- Nothing further.

25:32.832 --> 25:38.137
- I am so sorry for your loss,
Mrs. Bergkamp.

25:38.170 --> 25:41.273
That day at the hospital,
after Zoe had passed,

25:41.307 --> 25:45.111
did you have a conversation
with Lieutenant Olivia Benson?

25:45.144 --> 25:46.278
- Yes, we did.

25:48.848 --> 25:52.785
- Well, since Zoe's heart
had already been...

25:52.819 --> 25:54.954
Removed...

25:54.987 --> 25:58.958
She was trying to
convince us to donate it.

25:58.991 --> 26:01.728
- So the Lieutenant
and Dr. Franchella

26:01.761 --> 26:03.229
were on the same page?

26:03.262 --> 26:06.132
- And that was very upsetting.

26:06.165 --> 26:10.637
It had only been a few minutes
since Zoe had died,

26:10.670 --> 26:13.773
and Lieutenant Benson
was already

26:13.806 --> 26:17.844
laying a guilt trip on us.

26:17.877 --> 26:19.912
Dylan and I were basket cases.

26:19.946 --> 26:23.650
We were in no shape
to make a decision like that.

26:23.683 --> 26:26.653
And by then,
the damage was already done.

26:26.686 --> 26:29.756
You know, I don't know why

26:29.789 --> 26:33.626
a doctor thinks
she had the right

26:33.660 --> 26:37.697
to cut out my baby's heart

26:37.730 --> 26:42.068
from her chest
without asking us.

26:45.705 --> 26:47.640
- My name's Harry Lonegan.

26:47.674 --> 26:49.041
I'm from Buffalo, New York.

26:49.075 --> 26:51.744
- I'm going to ask you
some personal questions

26:51.778 --> 26:53.412
about your health,
Harry, is that okay?

26:53.445 --> 26:54.947
- Sure.

26:54.981 --> 26:59.686
- So tell us, do you have
any medical problems?

26:59.719 --> 27:01.420
- I have something called HCM.

27:04.223 --> 27:07.226
- Yeah, it means that
my heart muscle is too thick

27:07.259 --> 27:08.828
so it doesn't pump right.

27:08.861 --> 27:11.864
- And do you see a doctor
for this condition, Harry?

27:11.898 --> 27:16.168
- A lot of doctors--
my cardiologist, surgeon...

27:17.770 --> 27:19.906
- Well, the muscle that's
too thick in my heart

27:19.939 --> 27:22.274
is getting much worse,
so if I don't get

27:22.308 --> 27:24.711
a new heart soon, I could die.

27:24.744 --> 27:26.212
But if I do get
a new heart soon,

27:26.245 --> 27:29.882
Dr. Wilson said
I could live to be 90.

27:29.916 --> 27:32.184
- I wanna ask you about
the day that you went

27:32.218 --> 27:35.688
to the Women & Children's
Hospital of Buffalo, Harry.

27:35.722 --> 27:37.356
Why did you go there?

27:37.389 --> 27:40.226
- Well, my mom got a call
from Dr. Wilson.

27:40.259 --> 27:42.461
He said that a girl
had died in New York City

27:42.494 --> 27:44.697
and her heart was a match.

27:44.731 --> 27:46.933
So my mom and dad
rushed me to the hospital

27:46.966 --> 27:48.835
to get ready
for the transplant.

27:48.868 --> 27:51.938
- And what happened
after you arrived?

27:51.971 --> 27:53.405
- Well, they got a room for me,

27:53.439 --> 27:57.109
and Dr. Wilson came in
and told us what to expect.

27:57.143 --> 28:00.446
Then the nurses got me
ready for the operation.

28:00.479 --> 28:04.083
But the new heart never came.

28:04.116 --> 28:07.153
So my mom and dad
just took me home.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.421
- How many times
has Dr. Wilson called

28:09.455 --> 28:12.725
to tell you that
a new heart was a match?

28:12.759 --> 28:14.894
- That was the only time.

28:14.927 --> 28:20.166
I've been on the waiting list
for three years.

28:20.199 --> 28:24.036
- Thank you, Harry.

28:27.774 --> 28:29.208
- No questions,

28:29.241 --> 28:32.244
but I'm sure I speak for
everyone in this court, Harry.

28:32.278 --> 28:34.280
You're a very brave young man,

28:34.313 --> 28:36.082
and we wish you all the best.

28:45.157 --> 28:46.125
I'm so sorry.

28:46.158 --> 28:48.327
That must have been
difficult to listen to.

28:48.360 --> 28:49.528
- It was.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.764
You know, Mer,

28:51.798 --> 28:53.232
maybe we should drop
our part of the case.

28:53.265 --> 28:54.934
- No, Dylan.
- We should've listened

28:54.967 --> 28:56.502
to Lieutenant Benson
when she asked us

28:56.535 --> 28:57.970
to let Zoe's heart
go to that boy.

28:58.004 --> 28:59.138
- You should never have been

28:59.171 --> 29:00.506
put in that position,
Mr. Bergkamp.

29:00.539 --> 29:02.008
That's what this case
is all about.

29:02.041 --> 29:03.776
- But how can you try
to punish Dr. Franchella

29:03.810 --> 29:06.779
when all she wanted
to do is save lives?

29:09.281 --> 29:11.317
Honey, I need to say
something to them.

29:11.350 --> 29:14.086
- Don't you dare.

29:14.120 --> 29:17.356
- Excuse me.

29:17.389 --> 29:20.092
I'm Dylan Bergkamp.
That's my wife, Meredith.

29:20.126 --> 29:21.360
Yeah, we know who you are.

29:21.393 --> 29:23.529
- We're sorry for your loss.

29:23.562 --> 29:26.365
- I just wanna ask you
to forgive us.

29:26.398 --> 29:29.035
In that moment after Zoe died--

29:29.068 --> 29:30.502
well,
we made a selfish decision,

29:30.536 --> 29:32.371
and I wish
we could change that.

29:32.404 --> 29:35.842
But my wife and I...

29:35.875 --> 29:37.576
Harry, we just know
that another family's

29:37.609 --> 29:39.311
gonna come through for you.

29:50.890 --> 29:53.359
- I've been a pediatric
surgeon at Mercy Hospital

29:53.392 --> 29:55.027
for the past 12 years.

29:55.061 --> 29:58.597
I've done approximately
1,900 major surgical procedures

29:58.630 --> 30:00.199
on children during that period.

30:00.232 --> 30:02.568
- Do you know what
the mortality rate is

30:02.601 --> 30:04.003
for those procedures?

30:04.036 --> 30:06.005
- About 3%,
which is, I'm proud to say,

30:06.038 --> 30:09.876
about half the national average
for pediatric surgeries.

30:09.909 --> 30:12.411
- And in those
exceptional cases

30:12.444 --> 30:14.413
where your patients don't
survive the procedure,

30:14.446 --> 30:18.584
what is your hospital's
policy on organ harvesting?

30:18.617 --> 30:20.519
- Let me be very frank
about this.

30:20.552 --> 30:22.855
I do not follow
my hospital's policy.

30:22.889 --> 30:25.257
- Could you explain that,
Doctor?

30:25.291 --> 30:26.893
- Sure, um,

30:26.926 --> 30:29.128
most parents whose children
undergo surgery

30:29.161 --> 30:31.530
do not consent
to organ donation

30:31.563 --> 30:33.933
for a variety of reasons.

30:33.966 --> 30:36.302
So, unless I have a situation

30:36.335 --> 30:38.404
in which a parent has
explicitly indicated

30:38.437 --> 30:41.607
that they do not want
their child's organs donated,

30:41.640 --> 30:45.311
I presume consent,
which is actually the law

30:45.344 --> 30:46.946
in over 20 European countries.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.282
- Right. It's a disgrace.

30:50.316 --> 30:52.418
We're in the dark ages
of organ donation.

30:52.451 --> 30:56.989
- So, if one of your patients'
organ consent form is blank...

30:57.023 --> 30:58.958
- I harvest their organs
if they're viable

30:58.991 --> 31:00.226
for transplantation.

31:00.259 --> 31:02.461
- And the consent forms
themselves?

31:02.494 --> 31:04.964
- I fill them out so that
the Northeast Organ Network

31:04.997 --> 31:06.398
will accept the donations.

31:06.432 --> 31:08.467
Otherwise, they can't
be used in transplants,

31:08.500 --> 31:10.102
and children will die.

31:13.172 --> 31:15.007
- I show you

31:15.041 --> 31:18.978
defense exhibit
D-1 through D-31

31:19.011 --> 31:21.447
for identification.

31:21.480 --> 31:24.216
Do you recognize these files,
Dr. Franchella?

31:24.250 --> 31:28.254
- They're the medical charts
of 31 children across

31:28.287 --> 31:31.223
the northeast who have received
organs that I've harvested.

31:31.257 --> 31:35.361
- And in each of these cases,
you presumed consent

31:35.394 --> 31:37.629
to harvesting organs
these kids received?

31:37.663 --> 31:39.231
- Correct,

31:39.265 --> 31:40.967
because to ask a parent
to make that decision

31:41.000 --> 31:45.637
at the worst moment
of their lives is...

31:45.671 --> 31:49.441
Distasteful, to say the least.

31:53.412 --> 31:57.984
- How many of these transplants
were successful?

31:58.017 --> 32:00.452
- All of them.

32:00.486 --> 32:04.523
- Including Jessica LaFell,

32:04.556 --> 32:07.193
Emma Hyatt,

32:07.226 --> 32:10.262
Robbie Sanders, Dez Mohammed--

32:10.296 --> 32:12.464
- We get the point, Your Honor.

32:12.498 --> 32:14.700
- Nothing further.

32:23.209 --> 32:24.143
- Hey.

32:26.012 --> 32:29.448
- No, thank you.

32:31.150 --> 32:33.552
- Thirty-one kids who received
organs from Dr. Franchella.

32:33.585 --> 32:35.421
- Yeah.

32:35.454 --> 32:37.323
Well, about that, uh,

32:37.356 --> 32:39.992
I've come to realize
that I made

32:40.026 --> 32:43.129
the wrong call on that roof
in the hospital.

32:43.162 --> 32:44.296
- I feel like a priest today--

32:44.330 --> 32:45.998
everybody
unloading their guilt.

32:46.032 --> 32:49.001
- Well, that should
tell you something.

32:49.035 --> 32:51.503
This wasn't police business.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.341
- When I first came
to New York,

32:55.374 --> 32:58.410
I spent all my time at
the hospital with my father.

32:58.444 --> 33:01.013
And every afternoon,
I'd go down to the cafeteria,

33:01.047 --> 33:04.650
grab a cup of coffee.

33:04.683 --> 33:07.319
My father died
while I was asking

33:07.353 --> 33:12.224
one of the servers down there
for some half-and-half.

33:12.258 --> 33:15.527
- That must've been hard.

33:15.561 --> 33:16.795
- It would've been a lot harder

33:16.828 --> 33:18.597
if the doctor had
harvested his organs

33:18.630 --> 33:20.266
before I got back to his room.

33:26.372 --> 33:27.739
- You should've seen the look

33:27.773 --> 33:29.275
in the parents' eyes
when I told them.

33:29.308 --> 33:30.542
- You did the right thing,
Olivia.

33:30.576 --> 33:33.045
- And if that little boy
in Buffalo dies

33:33.079 --> 33:34.613
because I did the right thing?

33:34.646 --> 33:37.483
- Things are never easy when
they're not black and white.

33:39.118 --> 33:42.621
Well, there's nothing gray
for Dr. Franchella.

33:42.654 --> 33:44.223
She had to know that this was

33:44.256 --> 33:46.625
gonna eventually
catch up with her.

33:46.658 --> 33:49.061
She put her life on the line.

33:49.095 --> 33:52.398
She isn't getting
a penny for it.

33:55.434 --> 33:57.469
- When you vetted
Dr. Franchella's financials,

33:57.503 --> 34:00.739
there was a notation about
her charitable donations.

34:00.772 --> 34:02.641
- Mm-hmm.

34:02.674 --> 34:04.276
- Could she be
laundering money

34:04.310 --> 34:07.546
she's getting for organs
through those donations?

34:10.316 --> 34:13.652
- I'll have my people
check it out.

34:17.423 --> 34:18.824
- Hey.

34:18.857 --> 34:21.460
We found something
that you need to see.

34:21.493 --> 34:24.363
Dr. Franchella donates
$50,000 every year

34:24.396 --> 34:25.797
to the Children's
Heart Procurement Fund.

34:25.831 --> 34:27.366
- That's very generous.

34:27.399 --> 34:29.135
- It's not the amount
that jumped out at us.

34:29.168 --> 34:32.438
It's who she dedicates
the donation to.

34:41.747 --> 34:42.114
.

34:42.148 --> 34:42.781
- Good morning, Dr. Franchella.

34:45.284 --> 34:48.287
Yesterday, you admitted
to forging 32 signatures

34:48.320 --> 34:49.688
on organ donor consent forms.

34:49.721 --> 34:52.391
- Yes, to save the lives
of 32 children.

34:52.424 --> 34:54.360
- And you dared to do this
because you felt

34:54.393 --> 34:56.695
you were above the law?

34:56.728 --> 34:59.365
- Well, when a law is wrong,
when a law is harmful,

34:59.398 --> 35:01.700
we have to find the courage
to disobey it.

35:01.733 --> 35:03.769
- So you see yourself
as some kind of a--

35:03.802 --> 35:06.305
what, an activist?

35:06.338 --> 35:07.406
- Sure.

35:09.541 --> 35:11.643
- That's what
a pediatric surgeon is,

35:11.677 --> 35:14.446
by definition.

35:14.480 --> 35:18.484
- You had a son named Benjamin.

35:18.517 --> 35:20.186
- That's right.

35:20.219 --> 35:23.355
- He died from a congenital
heart condition in 2006.

35:26.192 --> 35:27.659
- Yes.

35:27.693 --> 35:30.262
- Was he on the waiting list
for a heart transplant,

35:30.296 --> 35:32.731
a transplant that
he never received?

35:32.764 --> 35:34.200
- That's correct.

35:34.233 --> 35:35.567
- Did the death of your own son

35:35.601 --> 35:38.237
inspire you to specialize
in pediatric surgery?

35:38.270 --> 35:39.805
- Yes, it did.

35:39.838 --> 35:41.807
- So the fact that Benjamin
didn't receive his transplant

35:41.840 --> 35:44.343
is what motivates you
to break the law?

35:44.376 --> 35:47.246
- My only motivation
is to save lives.

35:47.279 --> 35:48.514
- Is it possible,
Dr. Franchella,

35:48.547 --> 35:49.815
that in your zeal
to save lives,

35:49.848 --> 35:51.417
you'd harvest an organ
from a child

35:51.450 --> 35:52.618
that was not
legally deceased?

35:52.651 --> 35:55.421
- Objection.
This is outrageous.

35:55.454 --> 35:56.755
Mr. Stone is insinuating

35:56.788 --> 35:58.590
that Dr. Franchella
committed a homicide.

35:58.624 --> 36:00.792
- Move to strike.

36:00.826 --> 36:02.961
- Mr. Stone's remark is
stricken from the record,

36:02.994 --> 36:05.564
but I will allow the question.

36:05.597 --> 36:08.567
- And here's my answer.

36:08.600 --> 36:09.901
A second attending physician

36:09.935 --> 36:12.438
needs to certify death
on any patient,

36:12.471 --> 36:14.206
so it's not just
my medical judgment

36:14.240 --> 36:15.674
that's dispositive.

36:15.707 --> 36:18.244
And why would I let
one child die to save another?

36:18.277 --> 36:19.878
It makes--makes no sense.

36:19.911 --> 36:23.449
- But did you try hard enough
to save Zoe Bergkamp's life?

36:24.916 --> 36:27.719
- Did you try hard enough
to save Zoe Bergkamp's life?

36:27.753 --> 36:29.588
- The fenestration procedure
failed.

36:29.621 --> 36:31.590
She was legally brain dead
when I cut her chest open--

36:31.623 --> 36:33.659
- No, you're not answering
my question, Doctor.

36:33.692 --> 36:35.594
If that was your Benjamin
on that table,

36:35.627 --> 36:37.396
at that moment,
would you really have

36:37.429 --> 36:40.966
cracked open his sternum
and cut out his heart?

37:10.962 --> 37:15.434
- This is Jessica LaFell
at her tenth birthday party,

37:15.467 --> 37:20.772
Erin Hyatt practicing
before her band recital,

37:20.806 --> 37:23.041
and Robbie Sanders
playing point guard

37:23.074 --> 37:25.744
for his junior varsity team.

37:25.777 --> 37:27.979
[shoes squeaking on court,
faint cheering]

37:29.515 --> 37:32.651
These are just a few
of the kids who were recipients

37:32.684 --> 37:35.754
of organs harvested
by Dr. Franchella.

37:35.787 --> 37:38.290
Most of them probably
wouldn't be alive

37:38.324 --> 37:40.792
if she "followed" the rules.

37:40.826 --> 37:43.529
Under the cold, hard facts,
she broke the law,

37:43.562 --> 37:46.798
but as Judge Goldfarb
will instruct you,

37:46.832 --> 37:50.402
the law excuses a criminal act

37:50.436 --> 37:53.872
if it is based on necessity.

37:58.544 --> 38:01.447
This...

38:01.480 --> 38:05.817
Is the definition of necessity.

38:23.702 --> 38:25.337
- Some of you may have
a little red heart

38:25.371 --> 38:26.938
on your driver's license,

38:26.972 --> 38:29.775
and that's because you chose
to be an organ donor.

38:29.808 --> 38:32.478
The government didn't make
that decision for you

38:32.511 --> 38:35.013
and a doctor certainly didn't,

38:35.046 --> 38:36.848
because it's your body,

38:36.882 --> 38:38.850
and only you can decide
what to do with it.

38:38.884 --> 38:42.654
Dylan and Meredith Bergkamp
did not relinquish that right--

38:42.688 --> 38:44.856
that fundamental right
to make that highly personal

38:44.890 --> 38:47.993
and intimate choice
for their daughter, Zoe.

38:48.026 --> 38:51.530
Instead, a zealot, motivated
by her own personal tragedy,

38:51.563 --> 38:54.966
stole it with
the stroke of a pen.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.536
While Zoe's heart
was still beating,

38:57.569 --> 39:01.507
the defendant
pilfered her organs

39:01.540 --> 39:03.008
and stitched up
her empty torso,

39:03.041 --> 39:05.544
hoping that no one
would notice.

39:05.577 --> 39:07.513
Ms. Staines is
basically telling you

39:07.546 --> 39:10.382
the ends justify the means.

39:10.416 --> 39:12.884
Whose ends?

39:12.918 --> 39:14.953
Dr. Franchella
arrogantly decided

39:14.986 --> 39:16.822
that she knew better
than the patients' families,

39:16.855 --> 39:20.859
that she knows better than you.

39:20.892 --> 39:25.464
She did this
by breaking the law.

39:25.497 --> 39:29.100
She did this by imposing
her own morality.

39:29.134 --> 39:33.572
She did this by playing God.

39:48.654 --> 39:51.056
- Has the jury
reached a verdict?

39:51.089 --> 39:52.924
- We have, Your Honor.

40:10.709 --> 40:12.978
- We find the defendant
guilty of forgery

40:13.011 --> 40:15.981
in the second degree
on all 32 counts.

40:19.184 --> 40:22.454
- Thank you for your services,
ladies and gentlemen.

40:22.488 --> 40:25.223
This was a very difficult case.

40:25.256 --> 40:27.593
Court is dismissed.

40:33.699 --> 40:35.233
Yeah, of course, he does.

40:35.266 --> 40:38.236
Look, Lucy, he's had mac and
cheese three times this week,

40:38.269 --> 40:40.105
so I'm just gonna
pick up a falafel

40:40.138 --> 40:43.241
'cause at least it has
something green in it.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.944
Okay, thank you. Bye.

40:47.212 --> 40:48.714
- When I was five,

40:48.747 --> 40:50.582
I ate a burger and fries
every night of the week.

40:50.616 --> 40:53.852
- Why does that
not surprise me?

40:53.885 --> 40:57.589
So, what's on your mind, Stone?

40:57.623 --> 41:01.793
- Uh,
Dr. Franchella's sentencing.

41:01.827 --> 41:03.862
- You're seriously gonna
ask for jail time?

41:03.895 --> 41:05.597
- We need to set an example.

41:05.631 --> 41:07.599
- For all the
progressive-minded

41:07.633 --> 41:09.735
pediatric surgeons out there?

41:09.768 --> 41:11.169
- That's right.

41:11.202 --> 41:13.739
- Don't be a bully.

41:13.772 --> 41:15.607
She's gonna lose
her medical license

41:15.641 --> 41:17.275
over the felony conviction.

41:17.308 --> 41:21.613
That's the worst punishment
she could ever imagine.

41:21.647 --> 41:22.881
- I just took this job.

41:22.914 --> 41:24.282
I don't wanna look
like a pushover.

41:24.315 --> 41:26.918
- Or...

41:26.952 --> 41:31.757
maybe you're overcompensating.

41:31.790 --> 41:33.291
For what?

41:33.324 --> 41:35.293
- For not being in the room

41:35.326 --> 41:37.663
with your father when he died.

41:37.696 --> 41:38.930
- Hey,

41:38.964 --> 41:41.900
I'm sorry to interrupt, um...

41:41.933 --> 41:44.903
We just got
a call from Buffalo.

41:44.936 --> 41:47.673
Harry Lonegan died
about an hour ago.

42:19.905 --> 42:20.071
.

42:22.841 --> 42:30.015
