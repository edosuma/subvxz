00:59.025 --> 01:01.068
Mom...

01:22.358 --> 01:24.401
I love you, Libby.

01:26.192 --> 01:28.484
I love you, ladybug.

01:28.733 --> 01:31.026
Don't you ever forget that.

01:56.025 --> 02:01.401
Libby, what you're about to tell us
is very, very important.

02:02.858 --> 02:05.776
Did Ben kill your mom and your sisters?

02:09.316 --> 02:11.442
You were in the house when it happened.

02:14.441 --> 02:19.901
So tell us. It was Ben.
He killed them, right?

02:24.858 --> 02:26.984
<i>I have a meanness inside me.</i>

02:28.358 --> 02:30.234
<i>Real as an organ.</i>

02:30.858 --> 02:32.925
<i>It's the Day blood.</i>

02:33.025 --> 02:35.609
<i>Something's fuckin' wrong with it.</i>

02:36.941 --> 02:40.526
<i>I was eight the night they were killed
and suddenly I was famous.</i>

02:40.858 --> 02:44.692
<i>The little orphan girl
of the Kansas Prairie Massacre.</i>

02:47.733 --> 02:52.067
<i>So, strangers send me money.
Just enough for me to do nothing.</i>

02:52.525 --> 02:54.651
<i>Which was exactly what I did.</i>

02:56.275 --> 02:58.026
How much is left?

02:58.400 --> 03:00.776
Do you read the reports I send you?

03:02.191 --> 03:03.859
Sometimes.

03:04.025 --> 03:06.966
Have you at least listened
to my messages?

03:07.066 --> 03:08.175
How much?

03:08.275 --> 03:12.234
There is $482 and 12 cents
left in your fund.

03:13.191 --> 03:15.359
- Now as I have mentioned before...
- Jesus.

03:15.691 --> 03:19.591
...had you been able to replenish it
with any kind of regular income,

03:19.691 --> 03:21.609
we'd have been able to keep it afloat.

03:21.733 --> 03:24.609
You're also two months behind
on your rent.

03:30.191 --> 03:34.026
What about the book?
That should have made more money.

03:34.150 --> 03:36.425
- I know.
- Any new donations?

03:36.525 --> 03:38.175
Thirtieth anniversary is coming up...
You know, I could...

03:38.275 --> 03:41.026
People have short
attention spans, Libby.

03:41.191 --> 03:44.151
And there's always
a new murder, I'm afraid.

03:44.275 --> 03:45.966
They want to help other little girls.

03:46.066 --> 03:49.484
And the truth is,
you're not a little girl anymore.

03:59.358 --> 04:01.234
I'm not ready for this.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.091
But in a way,

04:04.191 --> 04:08.067
it could turn out to be
a blessing in disguise.

04:09.150 --> 04:12.317
And lead you into an exciting
new phase of your life.

04:14.775 --> 04:16.983
What do you want to be when you grow up?

04:17.649 --> 04:19.692
Are you fucking kidding me?

04:27.525 --> 04:32.026
<i>In the past Jim Jeffries used to hand me
bulging shoe boxes full of mail.</i>

04:33.108 --> 04:36.109
<i>Most of them letters with checks inside.</i>

04:38.441 --> 04:43.359
<i>In return, donors would receive a form
letter in my blocky handwriting that read...</i>

04:43.650 --> 04:45.966
<i>"Thank you for your donation.</i>

04:46.066 --> 04:51.234
<i>"It's people like you who let me
look forward to a brighter future.</i>

04:51.358 --> 04:54.567
<i>"Yours truly, Libby Day."</i>

05:15.149 --> 05:16.692
<i>Hello?</i>

05:17.691 --> 05:20.299
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Is this Lyle Wirth?

05:20.399 --> 05:22.317
<i>Yeah, who's asking?</i>

05:24.608 --> 05:27.067
It's Libby Day, you wrote me.

05:27.191 --> 05:32.109
<i>Oh, holy cow! Really?
Libby Day? Are you in town?</i>

05:32.983 --> 05:34.674
What do you mean, which town?

05:34.774 --> 05:37.359
<i>Well, you're in Kansas City,
that's where you live, right?</i>

05:39.191 --> 05:40.734
<i>Hello?</i>

05:41.941 --> 05:43.484
<i>Hello?</i>

05:44.899 --> 05:49.109
Yeah, I live in Kansas City.
Listen, your offer, is it serious?

05:54.149 --> 05:56.817
<i>Lyle Wirth looked like a serial killer.</i>

05:57.024 --> 05:59.091
<i>Which probably meant he wasn't one.</i>

05:59.191 --> 06:00.817
Lyle?

06:02.233 --> 06:03.692
Libby?

06:03.816 --> 06:06.317
Yeah, what?
You were expecting someone else?

06:08.358 --> 06:10.216
Libby Day.

06:10.316 --> 06:14.025
- I'm so excited to finally meet you...
- Okay, just fucking relax.

06:16.233 --> 06:20.008
- There's no reason to be scared.
- I'm not scared of you.

06:20.108 --> 06:22.900
I'm just trying to figure out what kind
of a person wants to meet in a laundromat

06:23.024 --> 06:25.025
in the middle of the fucking night.

06:25.149 --> 06:27.442
Oh, no, it's not what you think.
I own this place.

06:27.566 --> 06:30.442
I own two of them. I'm an entrepreneur.

06:31.566 --> 06:33.966
- Can I offer you something?
- Like what?

06:34.066 --> 06:36.091
- Detergent?
- I was thinking maybe a coffee...

06:36.191 --> 06:38.775
- Just take a fucking step back, man!
- Sorry.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.525
- What is it with you and personal space?
- All right.

06:45.483 --> 06:47.109
Tell me about this club.

06:47.233 --> 06:49.799
You know how some guys
collect baseball cards?

06:49.899 --> 06:53.591
Or women who read gossip magazines
and know everything about some celebrity.

06:53.691 --> 06:56.174
Like their baby's name or the town
where they grew up?

06:56.274 --> 06:59.275
You know, this is like that,
only it's about murders.

07:00.441 --> 07:02.067
We call it the Kill Club.

07:03.441 --> 07:07.109
- It's not as weird as it sounds.
- It sounds pretty fucking weird.

07:07.233 --> 07:10.758
It's like a bunch of people
who like true crimes and mysteries.

07:10.858 --> 07:13.484
You know, everyone has a case
that they are passionate about.

07:13.608 --> 07:17.442
You and your family are very special.
Huge with the club.

07:18.941 --> 07:21.650
I mean, it's a real tragedy
what happened.

07:22.149 --> 07:25.192
Your brother in jail, going on 28 years.

07:26.774 --> 07:28.216
Look...

07:28.316 --> 07:31.591
if you and your little club
want to convince me that Ben's innocent,

07:31.691 --> 07:35.008
- you're wasting your time.
- Just come along, it's like a...

07:35.108 --> 07:37.109
like a convention.

07:39.941 --> 07:42.424
- How much?
- Five hundred dollars.

07:42.524 --> 07:46.192
And there'll be a lot of collectors there,
so bring any souvenirs from your childhood

07:46.316 --> 07:48.484
I want a thousand.

07:49.149 --> 07:52.650
I can give you 700. And you let us pick
your brain about what happened that day.

07:59.566 --> 08:01.150
Fine.

08:01.483 --> 08:04.984
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Deal.

08:42.024 --> 08:44.317
I betcha can't!

08:47.274 --> 08:49.275
Come on, let's go!

08:56.191 --> 08:59.150
Hey! What about breakfast?

09:09.607 --> 09:12.567
It's a little warm out for that hat,
don't you think?

09:26.857 --> 09:30.525
Settle down, girls. Settle down.

09:33.107 --> 09:34.858
Hey, Ben.

09:34.982 --> 09:37.775
- Hey, Libby.
- I like your salt mountain.

09:37.899 --> 09:39.692
Oh, yeah?

09:43.107 --> 09:45.216
Mom, Ben and Libby are making
a mess at the table.

09:45.316 --> 09:47.716
Sweetie, it's fine. Michelle,
can you make sure everyone has juice.

09:47.816 --> 09:51.424
Mom! Libby took my pancake off my plate.

09:51.524 --> 09:55.067
Libby, Ben... eggs?

09:55.357 --> 09:59.716
Mom, Ben's wearing a hat inside.
It's not even cold. Duh!

09:59.816 --> 10:01.900
Michelle, you're right.
Ben, you need to take off your hat.

10:02.024 --> 10:04.567
It's not polite to wear
a hat at the table.

10:05.857 --> 10:07.442
Ben.

10:14.399 --> 10:18.257
Mom, Ben looks like some ghoul
from one of his metal band posters.

10:18.357 --> 10:19.924
Why?

10:20.024 --> 10:23.067
It's just hair, Mom. Don't freak out.

10:24.816 --> 10:26.192
I'll be back later.

10:35.274 --> 10:39.692
<i>It wasn't the first time I'd been offered
money for conferences or meetings.</i>

10:43.482 --> 10:47.442
<i>I'd been offered all sorts
of twisted deals over the years.</i>

11:08.982 --> 11:11.400
Want some sweets, little girl?

11:16.107 --> 11:17.650
Libby!

11:18.607 --> 11:20.674
- Welcome to our club.
- What?

11:20.774 --> 11:24.716
I said, "Welcome to our club!"
You want me to show you around?

11:24.816 --> 11:26.942
I want my money.

11:30.232 --> 11:33.275
Come on. I'll show you upstairs.

11:34.232 --> 11:36.150
The Kill Club, or "KC," as we call it,

11:36.274 --> 11:39.341
is basically for solvers
and fans of famous murders.

11:39.441 --> 11:42.775
- Everyone from Fanny Adams to the killer...
- Who's Fanny Adams?

11:42.899 --> 11:46.275
She's an eight-year-old who got chopped
to bits in England back in 1867.

11:46.566 --> 11:48.507
That guy you passed
with the sweets downstairs,

11:48.607 --> 11:51.400
he was playing the role
of her murderer, Frederick Baker.

11:54.899 --> 11:57.341
Jesus Christ!
You guys need to get a life.

11:57.441 --> 12:00.549
Yeah, we've been trying to push
the role players out, but...

12:00.649 --> 12:04.275
too many guys are into that. Plus,
it's a good source of income for us.

12:04.399 --> 12:06.358
- Us?
- The solvers.

12:07.191 --> 12:09.007
We're a serious-minded organization.

12:09.107 --> 12:13.567
Among our ranks are ex-cops, private
and insurance investigators, lawyers.

12:13.691 --> 12:17.025
We solve crimes. It's what we do.

12:22.607 --> 12:25.441
Lyle. Who's your young friend?

12:25.565 --> 12:28.525
Bob Bredella, this is Libby Day.

12:28.815 --> 12:33.233
Whose family was at the Kansas
farm house massacre.

12:34.482 --> 12:38.150
If you had a cock you would be
in pieces in my garbage right now.

12:38.565 --> 12:41.066
Parts that I didn't use for chili.

12:41.274 --> 12:43.257
Get your fucking hands off me,
you freak!

12:43.357 --> 12:46.590
- I'm kidding. I'm sorry. I'm only kidding.
- You think that's funny? You fat fuck!

12:46.690 --> 12:48.757
That wouldn't have been
the first fight at Kill Club,

12:48.857 --> 12:50.507
but it would've been the weirdest.

12:50.607 --> 12:52.715
- You know what? I'm outta here.
- No, no, no. Libby, please.

12:52.815 --> 12:54.257
I don't want to do this anymore.

12:54.357 --> 12:57.650
No, no. I can understand
why you wouldn't like it so far.

12:57.774 --> 13:00.424
Okay? But we're not all like that.

13:00.524 --> 13:03.525
Look, just give me a chance.
Look at this in here.

13:04.607 --> 13:08.316
A bunch of PI's who think
they've identified a serial killer.

13:08.440 --> 13:11.275
They're about to catch some guy
who has been crossing states.

13:11.399 --> 13:15.275
You know, Missouri, Kansas,
Oklahoma, to help kill people.

13:15.399 --> 13:18.150
- What do you mean help?
- They call him the Angel of Debt.

13:18.440 --> 13:21.840
They think he's like a Jack Kevorkian
for people with bad credit,

13:21.940 --> 13:24.590
good life insurance and no way out.

13:24.690 --> 13:27.900
You'll like our group.
It's serious, no costumes.

13:30.732 --> 13:33.483
Hi, everyone. It's my honor
to present our special guest,

13:33.774 --> 13:36.400
and the star of this year's Kill Club.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.066
Libby Day.

13:38.190 --> 13:42.882
Around 2:00 a.m.
on October the 13th, 1985,

13:42.982 --> 13:48.049
a person or persons killed
three members of the Day family

13:48.149 --> 13:50.674
in their farm house in Kinnakee, Kansas.

13:50.774 --> 13:54.424
The youngest child, Libby,
escaped the killer

13:54.524 --> 13:56.799
through a window in her mother's room.

13:56.899 --> 14:00.215
The oldest child, Benjamin,
never produced an alibi

14:00.315 --> 14:03.858
and was extremely uncooperative
with the police.

14:03.982 --> 14:07.924
Libby testified,
she saw Ben commit the murders.

14:08.024 --> 14:11.275
Despite Libby's confused testimony,

14:11.399 --> 14:13.441
and young age,

14:13.565 --> 14:17.507
and despite a startling lack
of physical evidence,

14:17.607 --> 14:19.150
Ben Day was convicted.

14:19.274 --> 14:23.441
Based largely on rumors that he
was involved in Devil worship.

14:25.315 --> 14:27.340
- You done?
- I think the general consensus

14:27.440 --> 14:29.590
is that Runner Day, her father, did it.

14:29.690 --> 14:31.924
I mean, he goes to Patty,
tries to bully her for money,

14:32.024 --> 14:34.049
as usual gets nothing,
and he goes haywire.

14:34.149 --> 14:37.941
- I mean, the guy was crazy, right?
- Right. I don't know...

14:39.190 --> 14:41.215
Look, I didn't know him,
he left when I was, like, two.

14:41.315 --> 14:42.775
- Where is he now?
- I don't know.

14:42.899 --> 14:44.941
There was a blood stain
on Michelle's bed sheets.

14:45.065 --> 14:46.924
Different blood type
than anyone in the family.

14:47.024 --> 14:49.816
But since the sheets were from Goodwill,

14:49.940 --> 14:51.924
prosecutor says that blood
could've come from anywhere.

14:52.024 --> 14:55.257
Yeah, we were poor. A lot of our shit
came from Goodwill, okay?

14:55.357 --> 14:58.049
Do you remember anything
out of the ordinary

14:58.149 --> 14:59.757
- happening that day?
- Like what?

14:59.857 --> 15:03.483
Like, how your mother reacted
to the Krissi Cates scandal.

15:03.607 --> 15:05.608
- Who?
- Krissi Cates.

15:06.940 --> 15:08.358
I don't know who that is.

15:08.524 --> 15:11.316
- You mentioned her in your book.
- I didn't write that book.

15:11.857 --> 15:14.507
- I didn't even read it.
- What about Trey Teepano?

15:14.607 --> 15:17.150
What about Ben Day? You want to hear
what I have to say about him?

15:17.274 --> 15:20.007
Please, this is the grossest
miscarriage of justice ever.

15:20.107 --> 15:21.507
What is this woman's deal?

15:21.607 --> 15:23.549
Magda here is very involved
in the effort to free your brother.

15:23.649 --> 15:26.882
He's a wonderful man.
He draws, he writes poetry.

15:26.982 --> 15:29.049
You should get to know him, Libby.

15:29.149 --> 15:33.191
You really should. In three weeks,
that window is going to close.

15:33.524 --> 15:36.090
- What?
- In order to solve this crime,

15:36.190 --> 15:39.340
we need to compile new evidence and...

15:39.440 --> 15:43.798
if you were inclined, you could recant your
testimony when we file for habeas corpus.

15:43.898 --> 15:47.757
- But... time is of the essence.
- What are you talking about?

15:47.857 --> 15:50.524
Oh, because of budget cuts,
they are consolidating departments

15:50.648 --> 15:53.882
and disposing of evidence
from cases older than 10 years.

15:53.982 --> 15:57.941
Which means, in three weeks' time,
Ben's file will be shredded.

16:01.065 --> 16:05.173
You're just a few people who like
murder mysteries and true crimes...

16:05.273 --> 16:08.548
- Libby. Ben is innocent and we're trying...
- He's never even filed for an appeal!

16:08.648 --> 16:12.858
He's had reason enough
for eight appeals but he has lost hope.

16:12.982 --> 16:14.774
Good.

16:15.107 --> 16:17.983
- Please help...
- No. It's not a conspiracy theory.

16:18.107 --> 16:20.173
- Hey, don't be like that!
- Get your hands off me!

16:20.273 --> 16:21.816
At least stay and try and convince us.

16:21.940 --> 16:24.691
I told you she wouldn't bother,
lazy little liar.

16:26.565 --> 16:30.858
Yes, that's what you are
and what you've always been. A liar!

16:38.107 --> 16:40.983
You don't know shit
about what happened that night.

16:45.273 --> 16:47.066
None of you.

16:49.815 --> 16:51.774
Run! Run!

16:51.898 --> 16:53.733
No!

16:55.940 --> 16:58.483
Libby! Libby!

17:02.607 --> 17:04.273
Libby!

17:24.272 --> 17:26.733
They're all dead!

17:57.523 --> 18:00.483
<i>"Once I was in art class
and met a boy named Ben.</i>

18:00.607 --> 18:03.149
<i>"It was his heart I knew I would win.</i>

18:03.273 --> 18:06.399
<i>"He has big blue eyes
and really nice skin.</i>

18:06.773 --> 18:08.608
<i>"Are you 'in'?"</i>

18:09.440 --> 18:13.483
<i>"It's Saturday and I'm thinking of you.
Guess who?"</i>

18:42.565 --> 18:44.816
Hey, do you know someone here?

18:46.065 --> 18:47.608
Him.

18:48.273 --> 18:50.382
Hey. Hey.

18:50.482 --> 18:52.649
Hey, do you know this kid?

18:54.107 --> 18:56.340
No, I don't hang out
with middle-schoolers.

18:56.440 --> 18:58.816
- Fuck off.
- Oh, little guy's pissed.

18:58.940 --> 19:01.173
Okay, dude, what's up?
Do I know you or what?

19:01.273 --> 19:02.774
I'm a friend of Trey's,
I come here all the time.

19:02.898 --> 19:05.923
You liar. That crazy Indian
doesn't have any friends.

19:06.023 --> 19:08.983
Is he even really Indian?
He looks Asian to me.

19:09.107 --> 19:12.358
I think he's... what do they call it?
A mixed blood. He's like two different things.

19:12.482 --> 19:15.298
So, like, his drunken granddad
raped a Chinese whore?

19:15.398 --> 19:19.649
You better watch your mouth, Trey's
into some scary ass shit. Satanic shit.

19:21.440 --> 19:23.423
Yeah, we get into some
pretty dark shit sometimes.

19:23.523 --> 19:26.107
You're one of the guys
that killed the cows?

19:28.106 --> 19:31.340
We have to. It's an order.

19:31.440 --> 19:35.524
Bro, that's a weird order.
That was my hamburger.

19:35.690 --> 19:37.381
Look at his face.

19:37.481 --> 19:40.941
Sometimes things have to die.
We have to kill them.

19:41.856 --> 19:44.566
Just like Jesus requires sacrifice,

19:45.815 --> 19:47.857
so does Satan.

20:05.731 --> 20:09.482
- Mom, is Ben in trouble?
- No, sweetie, Ben's fine.

20:09.606 --> 20:12.149
- Are you sure?
- Michelle, what do you want?

20:12.565 --> 20:15.232
- I heard rumors.
- What kind of rumors?

20:16.440 --> 20:19.857
Mom, there's a car coming!

20:22.273 --> 20:23.316
Who is it?

20:24.856 --> 20:26.357
Morning.

20:30.398 --> 20:32.232
Thank you.

20:37.190 --> 20:39.232
Who's the little spy?

20:39.356 --> 20:41.149
That's Libby.

20:42.773 --> 20:45.048
She's got big blue eyes like her mom.

20:45.148 --> 20:47.423
Where are your people
from originally? Ireland?

20:47.523 --> 20:50.090
Germany. My maiden name was Krause.

20:50.190 --> 20:52.149
There was another
German farmer near Ark City.

20:52.273 --> 20:57.381
Last summer, his hopper went screwy
and dumped 4000 pounds of wheat on him.

20:57.481 --> 21:01.256
Poor fellow drowned in it. He suffocated
before they could get to him.

21:01.356 --> 21:03.774
- I know the story.
- His farm's going under.

21:04.065 --> 21:09.274
He owed us... I mean,
the FHA a lot of money.

21:09.606 --> 21:12.732
Why you working on a Saturday, Joseph?
Is something wrong?

21:15.940 --> 21:17.941
They're going to foreclose.

21:18.856 --> 21:21.840
- Why now?
- Prices aren't what they used to be.

21:21.940 --> 21:25.006
A strong harvest is what brought those
prices down, that could change next year.

21:25.106 --> 21:27.756
There's no way for you
to come out on top.

21:27.856 --> 21:29.840
I could sell the animals,
I'll sell some of the machinery.

21:29.940 --> 21:34.607
The animals aren't worth much.
You already sold most of the machinery.

21:35.606 --> 21:37.607
There's got to be a way.

21:37.731 --> 21:41.191
- Banks said they would back...
- Your bank's going under, too.

21:41.690 --> 21:43.756
I'm sorry.

21:43.856 --> 21:45.691
They're just trying to get rid of us.

21:47.356 --> 21:49.506
I'm not sure who "they" are.

21:49.606 --> 21:51.774
The only way to fix this is money.

21:53.231 --> 21:56.816
I'm talking beg, borrow, steal.

21:56.940 --> 21:59.441
Time for pride is over, Patty.

22:00.440 --> 22:05.857
<i>Libby? What you're about to tell us
is very, very important.</i>

22:07.231 --> 22:10.357
<i>Did Ben kill your mom and your sisters?</i>

22:14.481 --> 22:18.566
<i>You were in the house
when it happened, so tell us.</i>

22:19.106 --> 22:22.941
It was Ben, he killed them, right?

22:37.273 --> 22:39.107
Listen, I've been thinking.

22:40.106 --> 22:42.423
If I were to look into this case
some more, is that something your club

22:42.523 --> 22:45.506
- would be able to finance?
- You changed your mind?

22:45.606 --> 22:48.607
No, as far as I'm concerned
Ben is the killer, but...

22:49.856 --> 22:51.732
I need money.

22:52.814 --> 22:55.732
And I'm willing to offer your club
three weeks of my life in exchange.

22:58.314 --> 23:00.673
- That doesn't sound very noble.
- Whatever.

23:00.773 --> 23:03.024
No, wait. Libby. Libby.

23:03.564 --> 23:05.399
Do you really have
no contact with Runner?

23:06.481 --> 23:07.440
No.

23:07.564 --> 23:09.006
It might be a good idea
to track him down.

23:09.106 --> 23:11.315
Although, personally
I don't think Runner did it.

23:12.939 --> 23:15.756
- What's your theory?
- I'm not quite ready to share that yet.

23:15.856 --> 23:19.482
Come on! If Ben is so innocent,
why doesn't he try to get out?

23:20.273 --> 23:22.381
Maybe you should go talk to him.

23:22.481 --> 23:24.774
No. We start with other people first.

23:24.898 --> 23:28.506
- What is it? Is it a money thing?
- I just don't like wasting my time, okay?

23:28.606 --> 23:32.940
Okay. How about... $300?

23:35.356 --> 23:36.607
Where do you get this money?

23:36.731 --> 23:39.607
As treasurer, I have a certain amount
of discretionary funds.

23:39.731 --> 23:42.482
This is the project
I choose to use them for.

23:42.606 --> 23:45.232
What? What's so funny?

23:47.356 --> 23:49.839
You're a noble embezzler.
That's what's funny.

23:49.939 --> 23:52.506
- That makes you almost likable.
- Thanks.

23:52.606 --> 23:56.714
- I need 500 more. An advance.
- Why?

23:56.814 --> 23:58.839
'Cause I got to get my car
out of the shop.

23:58.939 --> 24:01.690
It's been held hostage
for the last six months.

24:03.106 --> 24:05.315
I'm going to need a car.

24:07.689 --> 24:08.857
All right.

24:12.773 --> 24:15.298
- You better play ball.
- Yeah, yeah, I will.

24:15.398 --> 24:20.232
- Go see Ben. It all starts with him.
- No, it all ends with him. He killed them.

24:21.773 --> 24:24.982
- I'm serious, Libby, go talk to him...
- Fine! I'll talk to him!

24:25.106 --> 24:27.607
Just to prove you freaks wrong.

24:27.731 --> 24:30.232
Make that fat bitch Magda cry.

24:51.773 --> 24:53.506
<i>I think...</i>

24:53.606 --> 24:58.274
<i>I saw Ben as I was standing
at the door of my mom's room.</i>

24:58.939 --> 25:02.565
He was threatening her with our shotgun.

25:38.523 --> 25:41.440
Satan encourages you
to do what feels good.

25:41.564 --> 25:44.173
Because we're all basically animals.

25:44.273 --> 25:46.940
Settle down. Quiet.

25:47.064 --> 25:51.024
Benjamin, you do understand
this is very serious, don't you?

26:06.939 --> 26:09.607
- Hi, Libby.
- Hey, Ben.

26:10.606 --> 26:13.881
- I never thought I'd see you here.
- Yeah, well, I never thought I'd come.

26:13.981 --> 26:16.839
Turns out you got
a couple of fans outside.

26:16.939 --> 26:19.107
People who take you
for the victim, well played.

26:19.522 --> 26:22.398
I thought about you
a lot over the years.

26:23.356 --> 26:26.815
Every once in a while, someone
tells me about you but it's not the same.

26:29.272 --> 26:30.648
How's it in there?

26:30.772 --> 26:34.482
I'm fine. Really, I am.
I have my high school diploma.

26:34.606 --> 26:37.732
I'm even part way
to a college degree. English.

26:38.314 --> 26:40.857
I read fucking Shakespeare now.

26:45.522 --> 26:47.398
Good for you.

26:50.772 --> 26:52.898
Man, Libby, you're so beautiful.

26:53.481 --> 26:56.756
You've got Mom's eyes.
You must hear that all the time.

26:56.856 --> 26:58.940
Who would tell me that?

26:59.522 --> 27:02.482
Runner's gone, don't know where.

27:02.606 --> 27:04.881
Diane's dead. There's no one.

27:04.981 --> 27:07.256
That's not good.
They should've taken better care of you.

27:07.356 --> 27:09.398
You're born again?

27:10.772 --> 27:13.089
You found Jesus in there?
Why are you being so nice to me?

27:13.189 --> 27:16.214
I'm not that nice, Libby.
I got a lot of anger for a lot of people.

27:16.314 --> 27:18.357
Just... you're not one of them.

27:23.814 --> 27:25.065
What?

27:28.606 --> 27:30.482
You're different.

27:31.647 --> 27:34.190
You're different than I imagined.

27:36.314 --> 27:37.773
You know, we don't have
to stay in this room.

27:37.897 --> 27:42.232
This room is designated for death row
inmates. We can be in an open room.

27:45.314 --> 27:47.773
Unless you requested this one?

27:55.897 --> 27:59.232
- Remember that horse, Yellow?
- Yellow?

27:59.397 --> 28:01.773
The famous horse
that refused to be ridden?

28:01.897 --> 28:03.815
- What, did he bite you?
- Nothing that dramatic.

28:03.939 --> 28:06.648
Just thought I had a good hold of him,
he threw me against the fence

28:06.772 --> 28:10.023
and slammed my hand against a nail.

28:10.647 --> 28:14.273
Runner been in here?
You know where he is?

28:14.397 --> 28:19.256
The last letter came care of Bert Nolan's
Group Home for Men somewhere in Oklahoma.

28:19.356 --> 28:24.190
He asked me for $500 to carry on
his research on my behalf.

28:24.314 --> 28:26.315
Good ol' Runner.

28:26.772 --> 28:31.690
- What's the tat on your arm?
- Oh, it's a old flame.

28:32.439 --> 28:34.857
We started out as pen pals.

28:37.689 --> 28:40.690
I thought I loved her.
I thought we'd get married.

28:41.314 --> 28:43.732
How about you? You got a boyfriend?

28:45.647 --> 28:47.565
Don't do that.

28:47.689 --> 28:51.357
How dare you? Don't...
You don't get to do that.

28:51.897 --> 28:53.256
Libby, I'm...

28:53.356 --> 28:56.690
No, you don't get to ask me
fucking questions.

28:58.606 --> 29:01.631
I mean, here comes my little sister
after all these years.

29:01.731 --> 29:05.881
And I'm thinking,
"Maybe this one thing will work out."

29:05.981 --> 29:09.047
Maybe I won't be so fucking lonely.

29:09.147 --> 29:11.297
We can talk about a goddamn horse,

29:11.397 --> 29:14.440
that's all I'm asking for,
something just as tiny as that.

29:14.981 --> 29:17.131
I don't remember the horse.

29:17.231 --> 29:20.065
Yellow? It was a dirty old farm horse.

29:20.189 --> 29:22.339
- But it was your horse.
- How come I can't remember him?

29:22.439 --> 29:24.797
You were pretty young
when Mom had to sell him.

29:24.897 --> 29:27.190
Broke her heart,
but she needed the money.

29:27.772 --> 29:30.232
I can tell you all about him.

29:37.939 --> 29:41.773
- Go ahead, ask the question.
- I don't need to ask.

29:43.605 --> 29:45.630
- I know you killed them.
- No, I did not.

29:45.730 --> 29:46.964
That's not what you said back then.

29:47.064 --> 29:49.172
Of course not, I was a teenage boy
in a house full of girls.

29:49.272 --> 29:52.214
At school I was the kid
that nobody paid attention to.

29:52.314 --> 29:54.315
In that court room,
people were scared of me.

29:54.439 --> 29:57.505
- I was a bad ass.
- A bad ass who killed his family.

29:57.605 --> 30:01.981
Libby, I was a fool, but I did not
kill Mom or Debby or Michelle.

30:02.105 --> 30:05.356
Then why have you never filed
for an appeal?

30:07.564 --> 30:10.398
You like it so much in there,
you want to stay there?

30:12.064 --> 30:15.148
You know what I think?
I think you're full of shit.

31:02.980 --> 31:04.898
You look awesome.

31:05.439 --> 31:07.190
Told ya.

31:14.730 --> 31:17.106
You don't think I might
be too old for you?

31:17.522 --> 31:18.714
What's that mean?

31:18.814 --> 31:21.731
Means that 17 might just be
too old for your taste.

31:24.022 --> 31:25.648
Come on.

31:40.397 --> 31:43.565
Come on, Ben. Focus on me.
Come on, baby.

31:44.064 --> 31:45.523
Is that all you got?

31:57.439 --> 32:00.398
You know, I saw a couple
of friends today at the mall.

32:01.397 --> 32:04.398
You know a little girl
named Krissi Cates?

32:08.480 --> 32:12.523
Yeah. She's in that art class I've been
helping out with after school. Why?

32:14.064 --> 32:16.898
You never told me
about no art class, Ben.

32:17.480 --> 32:19.922
Yeah, well, I'm just helping kids.

32:20.022 --> 32:22.481
One of my old teachers asked me to.

32:25.147 --> 32:27.547
Well, they say the police
are looking for ya.

32:27.647 --> 32:30.672
They say you did some
naughty things to some little girls.

32:30.772 --> 32:33.005
Everyone's calling you a perv.

32:33.105 --> 32:35.440
What are you talking about?

32:37.689 --> 32:39.440
I love you.

32:46.980 --> 32:48.815
The baby's kicking.

33:02.314 --> 33:05.065
It's Aunt Diane!

33:05.897 --> 33:09.315
There are more bags in the car,
with some surprises. Go get them.

33:13.730 --> 33:16.005
- You shouldn't have.
- It's what I do.

33:16.105 --> 33:17.731
Are you okay?

33:18.605 --> 33:20.564
The wolves are at the door.

33:26.688 --> 33:28.523
That's too much.

33:31.147 --> 33:33.106
I love the land.

33:35.522 --> 33:37.606
It's like loving your kids.

33:38.772 --> 33:42.689
I know you probably don't know what I mean,
but it's this overwhelming feeling.

33:44.147 --> 33:48.689
Watching it grow and produce.
And reproduce.

33:50.063 --> 33:54.231
But you can only work so many hours
a day, and so many days a week, Patty.

33:54.730 --> 33:57.797
All by yourself,
you never stood a chance.

33:57.897 --> 33:59.838
You should have done like me
and left this place.

33:59.938 --> 34:01.422
You should have gone to college,
you had the brains.

34:01.522 --> 34:03.898
- It's Mom and Dad's farm.
- I know.

34:05.480 --> 34:07.481
It's time to let it go.

34:08.147 --> 34:09.938
I don't see Ben.

34:10.688 --> 34:14.938
- He left early this morning.
- How are things with him?

34:16.563 --> 34:18.981
- Difficult.
- Where is he?

34:21.897 --> 34:23.438
I don't know, why?

34:24.605 --> 34:27.981
So what do you think,
is it a boy or a girl?

34:30.355 --> 34:32.773
I don't know. How would I know?

34:32.897 --> 34:37.231
- So you're saying you don't care.
- No, I do care.

34:37.522 --> 34:39.922
I was actually thinking
of some names if it's a girl.

34:40.022 --> 34:43.563
- Well, do you care to share?
- Not yet.

34:45.980 --> 34:48.231
Are you sure Michelle hasn't found out?

34:49.105 --> 34:51.005
She hasn't said anything.

34:51.105 --> 34:53.063
That little weasel.

34:53.563 --> 34:55.313
You know, I swear if I ever
get my hands on her...

34:55.438 --> 34:57.231
Shut up.

34:57.980 --> 34:59.939
You know I've promised my Dad, Ben.

35:00.063 --> 35:03.606
He said if he ever found out I wasn't
a virgin anymore he'd shoot me in the head.

35:07.688 --> 35:11.231
So you tell your nosy little sister
to stop talking shit about me at school.

35:11.605 --> 35:13.588
Before he finds out.

35:13.688 --> 35:16.814
Hey, it's Trey! Quit fucking around
and get out of there.

35:16.938 --> 35:19.981
You don't know him, Ben.
You don't know what he's capable of.

35:27.397 --> 35:29.898
You know, I think we should leave town
before our parents get back.

35:30.272 --> 35:31.273
Okay.

35:31.563 --> 35:34.713
Really? That easy.

35:34.813 --> 35:36.898
- What?
- How are you going to support us?

35:41.522 --> 35:45.106
You'll have to get a job or...
I don't know, ask Runner for money.

35:45.230 --> 35:48.398
- Runner? My dad?
- Yeah. He makes money, right?

36:02.563 --> 36:06.523
He does handyman stuff, for work,
labor... he works on farms.

36:06.647 --> 36:09.106
- Are you kidding?
- Well, yeah, what did you expect?

36:09.730 --> 36:12.273
Trey! Ben doesn't know about his dad!

36:16.647 --> 36:18.981
You sorry sack of shit.

36:19.355 --> 36:22.773
You don't know about your dad?
What the fuck, dude?

36:23.105 --> 36:25.981
Hey, Ben. You're smoking
your dad's weed, buddy.

36:27.063 --> 36:29.713
- What are you guys talking about?
- It's crap and he overcharges.

36:29.813 --> 36:33.088
- Said he got it in Texas.
- Let's go find Runner, honey.

36:33.188 --> 36:36.689
So we can get some money.
Get the hell out of here.

36:37.272 --> 36:42.130
<i>Teenagers across America are playing
with a new and frightening game: Satanism.</i>

36:42.230 --> 36:44.856
<i>Their school books are marked up
by Satanic symbols.</i>

36:44.980 --> 36:47.088
<i>They are seduced by heavy metal heroes,</i>

36:47.188 --> 36:51.046
<i>many of whom feature Satanic imagery
in their songs and album covers.</i>

36:51.146 --> 36:53.713
<i>The fixation on violence, evil and death</i>

36:53.813 --> 36:56.046
<i>leads them to commit abominable crimes,</i>

36:56.146 --> 36:59.671
<i>including human sacrifice
and sexual abuse of children.</i>

36:59.771 --> 37:01.939
<i>We're in the very throes
of a new Satanic age...</i>

37:02.063 --> 37:05.338
Everyone at the time. Police, judges,
the psychiatric community,

37:05.438 --> 37:08.380
- they were seeing Satanists everywhere.
- And there weren't?

37:08.480 --> 37:11.005
A few lost, frustrated kids
take those lyrics too literally?

37:11.105 --> 37:14.231
Yes, but real criminal Satanists?

37:14.688 --> 37:17.647
- What did the investigation say?
- The crime scene was contaminated.

37:17.771 --> 37:19.647
People traipsing in and out
of the house all day

37:19.771 --> 37:22.272
was against all the rules of police
procedure, but no one cared.

37:22.396 --> 37:25.880
They had the perfect culprit, a strange
teenage boy that no one in town liked much

37:25.980 --> 37:29.772
and listened to heavy metal.
You know, it was convenient.

37:30.980 --> 37:34.189
I've got the files
so you can take a look.

37:36.730 --> 37:38.838
Libby, it's not a request.
It's part of the job.

37:38.938 --> 37:40.481
Seriously?

37:40.605 --> 37:44.147
It's like you guys want Ben out
more than he does. It's ridiculous.

37:44.271 --> 37:46.588
- What did you think of him?
- I don't know, Lyle.

37:46.688 --> 37:49.981
Did you ever hear about him
with his serious girlfriend?

37:50.730 --> 37:53.880
Molly or Polly? Something like that.

37:53.980 --> 37:55.772
No. It doesn't ring a bell.

37:56.938 --> 37:58.897
It's probably nothing.

37:59.730 --> 38:04.064
He had a tattoo of it on his arm.
It's probably another Magda.

38:04.646 --> 38:06.689
Will you just tell me?

38:07.730 --> 38:09.772
Just tell me, who do you think did it?

38:10.855 --> 38:14.439
I think Lou Cates did it.
Krissi Cates' father.

38:14.730 --> 38:18.064
Found out he had a history of violence,
went to jail for aggravated battery.

38:20.688 --> 38:23.064
You still have no idea
who Krissi Cates is, do you?

38:24.021 --> 38:25.838
- No.
- Libby...

38:25.938 --> 38:28.647
Come on, I know you hate doing this,
but could you try?

38:28.771 --> 38:31.046
You're stuck with us anyway, just try.

38:31.146 --> 38:34.421
You're smart, you'll see for yourself
that something's not right.

38:34.521 --> 38:37.272
Just... just take a look at the folder.

38:38.438 --> 38:41.897
Come on, you'll see. Please.

38:47.813 --> 38:51.522
<i>Since I was seven
I'd only seen flashes of Ben.</i>

38:52.105 --> 38:56.064
<i>Like some evil entity
in a haunted house.</i>

38:57.521 --> 39:00.647
<i>But I'd forgotten
there was once just Ben.</i>

39:01.938 --> 39:03.713
<i>My brother.</i>

39:03.813 --> 39:06.981
<i>Shy. Serious.</i>

39:08.730 --> 39:11.022
<i>Couldn't have done what they said.</i>

39:11.313 --> 39:13.147
<i>What I said.</i>

39:16.105 --> 39:21.421
<i>The molestation of Krissi Cates and
the murders weren't legally linked, but...</i>

39:21.521 --> 39:25.606
<i>everyone had heard the rumors and the jury
was surely poisoned against him.</i>

39:26.313 --> 39:27.856
<i>Oddly,</i>

39:28.521 --> 39:33.064
<i>all the little girls backed down
and the Cates family never pressed charges.</i>

39:34.688 --> 39:39.046
<i>The Kill Club found Krissi Cates' mother
in Emporia, Kansas, but...</i>

39:39.146 --> 39:41.772
<i>she'd never returned their calls.</i>

39:43.855 --> 39:48.088
<i>You never leave a message
for someone you really want to reach.</i>

39:48.188 --> 39:53.564
<i>You keep calling and calling
until somebody picks up.</i>

39:54.105 --> 39:58.814
<i>Out of anger, curiosity or just fear.</i>

39:58.938 --> 40:00.522
<i>Hello?</i>

40:02.480 --> 40:04.046
Hello?

40:04.146 --> 40:08.314
I'm so sorry, did I just wake you up?
I didn't realize how late it was.

40:08.438 --> 40:11.397
- I can call back later.
- <i>Who is this?</i>

40:12.563 --> 40:16.480
My name is Stephanie Adams,
I'm an old friend of Krissi's,

40:16.604 --> 40:19.105
- I was just looking for her...
- <i>Christ! You people won't stop calling</i>

40:19.229 --> 40:20.546
<i>until I give you what you want, right?</i>

40:20.646 --> 40:22.671
I have no idea what you're
talking about, ma'am.

40:22.771 --> 40:26.814
I'm just an old friend looking for her,
I thought maybe you could help me.

40:28.771 --> 40:32.147
- <i>What was your name? Sally?</i>
- Yeah, my name is Sally Adams.

40:32.271 --> 40:37.105
<i>Listen, Sally, I've remarried and I have
very little contact with my previous family.</i>

40:37.229 --> 40:41.504
Got it. You don't by chance
have a number for Lou...

40:41.604 --> 40:43.855
or know where I can find him?

40:45.521 --> 40:49.105
<i>Well, Lou would be in some bar
in Kansas, I'd guess.</i>

40:49.688 --> 40:55.213
<i>As for Krissi, drive west on I-70.
Just past Columbia.</i>

40:55.313 --> 40:58.647
<i>Take a left into the giant strip club.</i>

40:58.771 --> 41:00.314
<i>You'll find her.</i>

41:00.438 --> 41:02.522
<i>Don't call again.</i>

41:17.104 --> 41:18.379
Mrs. Day,

41:18.479 --> 41:22.064
I've called you down to the precinct due
to some serious allegations about your son.

41:22.438 --> 41:25.730
How's he regarded in school?
Is he a popular kid?

41:25.854 --> 41:28.046
He has lots of friends.

41:28.146 --> 41:30.272
From what we understand,
he's a bit of a loner.

41:30.396 --> 41:32.397
So what does that prove?

41:32.729 --> 41:35.296
- You have four children, correct?
- Yes.

41:35.396 --> 41:38.647
- Same father?
- Yes.

41:39.604 --> 41:41.439
Mrs. Day,

41:41.813 --> 41:47.004
we've got four little girls who say that Ben
touched them in their private areas.

41:47.104 --> 41:50.230
That he took them to some farm
and performed certain...

41:50.688 --> 41:55.980
acts associated
with ritualistic Devil worship.

41:56.854 --> 41:58.647
Some farm?

41:58.771 --> 42:02.230
- Ben doesn't even have a car.
- You don't know Ben.

42:05.188 --> 42:08.754
Satanic worship is not uncommon.

42:08.854 --> 42:11.105
It's made its way into all areas
of the community,

42:11.229 --> 42:14.421
and part of their rituals
involve the degradation of children.

42:14.521 --> 42:18.272
Do you have any evidence? Any witnesses?
Besides some 12-year-old girls...

42:18.396 --> 42:22.064
We got the note Ben left
in Krissi Cates' locker.

42:22.729 --> 42:24.546
We need to speak to a lawyer.

42:24.646 --> 42:28.230
You do realize that abuse
usually starts at home.

42:29.313 --> 42:30.939
Mrs. Day,

42:31.438 --> 42:33.897
with three little girls,

42:34.313 --> 42:37.564
if I were you, I'd want
the truth out more than anyone.

42:42.604 --> 42:44.713
- Mrs. Cates?
- Yes?

42:44.813 --> 42:47.480
I'm Patty Day. Ben Day's mother.

42:50.479 --> 42:52.564
It's Ben Day's mother.

42:54.938 --> 42:59.564
Can you take these and show me
exactly what happened?

43:06.271 --> 43:08.064
Thank you.

43:11.729 --> 43:13.314
Krissi?

43:14.688 --> 43:16.897
Krissi, I'm Patty Day.

43:17.896 --> 43:19.939
I'm Ben's mom.

43:20.979 --> 43:22.980
I don't want her here.

43:23.313 --> 43:25.147
- I don't want her here! You promised!
- Okay. Okay.

43:25.271 --> 43:27.397
We're not safe!

43:28.063 --> 43:31.772
We've heard of you. Got four kids
at home, can't afford one of them!

43:31.896 --> 43:36.213
Their daddy's a drunk, if not worse.
You're on welfare!

43:36.313 --> 43:41.272
Your meals come from a food bank and
Jesus Christ, you've let your son do this!

43:41.396 --> 43:44.772
I hope you're not hiding him.
Police are looking for him.

43:44.896 --> 43:48.938
- I'm trying to find him, I swear.
- Ben is going to hell!

44:01.937 --> 44:03.605
Krissi?

44:04.937 --> 44:06.879
- Yeah?
- Do you have time for a little chat?

44:06.979 --> 44:10.105
- About what?
- To be frank, it's about Ben Day.

44:10.229 --> 44:12.980
- Buy me a drink.
- Sure.

44:17.271 --> 44:18.688
Who's this?

44:18.812 --> 44:22.855
This is Libby. She's with me.
What can I get you?

44:23.229 --> 44:26.212
- Vodka cranberry, double.
- Make it two.

44:26.312 --> 44:29.938
So... Ben Day?

44:30.229 --> 44:32.296
He really fucked up my life.

44:32.396 --> 44:35.897
So... you maintain
you were molested by him?

44:37.354 --> 44:40.962
I was 11 and he was 16.

44:41.062 --> 44:43.897
He started hanging around
with me after school.

44:44.021 --> 44:47.962
I got that a lot. I was a cute kid.
And we had lots of money.

44:48.062 --> 44:50.980
- Go on.
- He would take me into the closet

44:51.104 --> 44:55.938
and make me perform oral sex on him
while making me pledge allegiance to Satan.

44:57.104 --> 44:59.772
Hey, baby, let me get a bag of chips.

45:01.187 --> 45:03.230
You don't mind, do you?

45:03.604 --> 45:08.087
Anyway, Ben was pretty sneaky with me.
I mean, he had an altar in there.

45:08.187 --> 45:12.605
Upside-down cross. Some dead animals.
Sacrificed things.

45:12.729 --> 45:15.438
That's why I thought that he was
working his way up to killing me,

45:15.562 --> 45:17.712
but he killed his family instead.

45:17.812 --> 45:20.480
His whole family was devil worshiping.

45:21.729 --> 45:25.504
How did your dad react when you told him
what Ben had done to you?

45:25.604 --> 45:28.605
God, he was so over-protective.
He went totally ballistic.

45:28.896 --> 45:31.171
Sometimes I think,
had my dad had found Ben,

45:31.271 --> 45:33.980
he would have killed him
and Ben's family would still be alive.

45:34.271 --> 45:37.522
- Your dad live around here?
- No, we lost touch.

45:38.437 --> 45:40.147
Hey, can you lend me 20 bucks?

45:40.271 --> 45:43.879
- Can we get your dad's address?
- I just told you. That we're out of touch.

45:43.979 --> 45:47.980
- Yeah, I know, but I'm sure there's a way...
- Lyle... take care of the check.

45:50.521 --> 45:52.563
How much did you say?

45:53.396 --> 45:56.272
You know what? Make it 50.
I'll totally pay you back.

45:56.396 --> 46:00.772
I'll give you a pen, you can...
write down your name and address.

46:02.271 --> 46:03.897
Here.

46:05.437 --> 46:07.855
<i>Libby Day.</i>

46:08.812 --> 46:12.504
<i>My name is Libby Day, you lying whore.</i>

46:12.604 --> 46:14.563
Don't lose that.

46:19.812 --> 46:21.522
<i>Burt Nolan Home.</i>

46:21.646 --> 46:26.438
I was looking a Runner,
or a Ronald Day. Is he staying with you?

46:26.562 --> 46:30.855
<i>Well, he's been in and out.
But I'd be happy to give him a message.</i>

46:30.979 --> 46:33.921
Could you ask him to call me back?
My name's Libby Day.

46:34.021 --> 46:36.230
It's kind of important.

46:37.437 --> 46:41.587
Would you tell him I need to talk to him
about Ben and what happened that night?

46:41.687 --> 46:45.647
<i>Ben and that night. Okay.</i>

46:48.271 --> 46:50.313
<i>That night.</i>

47:14.187 --> 47:15.938
<i>That night.</i>

47:17.979 --> 47:20.004
<i>I'd been a sleepwalker
since I could walk.</i>

47:20.104 --> 47:23.480
<i>My mom usually didn't move
when I got in bed with her.</i>

47:23.604 --> 47:26.129
<i>But... that night,</i>

47:26.229 --> 47:30.063
<i>she turned to me
and told me she loved me.</i>

47:31.020 --> 47:33.980
<i>She hardly ever told us she loved us.</i>

47:36.395 --> 47:38.105
<i>That's why I remember it.</i>

47:46.645 --> 47:49.146
<i>I can't dwell on these thoughts.</i>

47:49.604 --> 47:54.021
<i>I've labeled these memories as if they
were a particularly dangerous region.</i>

47:55.687 --> 47:57.730
<i>Dark place.</i>

48:12.354 --> 48:14.563
<i>Michelle's diary.</i>

48:15.354 --> 48:18.771
<i>I'd forgotten what a rotten
busy-body Michelle was.</i>

48:19.895 --> 48:23.605
<i>In her last pages, she kept writing
about Ben's girlfriend, Diondra,</i>

48:23.729 --> 48:25.771
<i>as an evil whore.</i>

48:41.437 --> 48:44.646
<i>I don't ever remember Ben
ever having a girlfriend.</i>

48:58.062 --> 49:01.063
<i>Diondra Wertzner.</i>

49:17.354 --> 49:19.271
I'm a bad mother.

49:19.395 --> 49:21.521
What are you talking about?

49:21.937 --> 49:24.295
You're Superwoman
as far as I'm concerned.

49:24.395 --> 49:27.920
You keep the farm going, you raise
four kids, get them to school every day

49:28.020 --> 49:30.212
and you don't drink
a gallon of bourbon to do it.

49:30.312 --> 49:32.563
No, that cop was right.

49:34.062 --> 49:38.021
If things weren't bad at home,
Ben wouldn't be in so much trouble.

49:42.479 --> 49:45.021
Fundamentally he's a good boy.

49:51.645 --> 49:54.129
Sometimes I think it'd be better
if I disappeared.

49:54.229 --> 49:56.646
Oh, yeah? And what about the kids?

49:57.187 --> 49:59.396
They could go with you.

49:59.979 --> 50:02.521
They'd be better off in Kansas City.

50:04.645 --> 50:06.896
Father's a nut job...

50:08.020 --> 50:10.063
and I'm a failure.

50:19.562 --> 50:21.563
That's Runner's new car.

50:25.687 --> 50:27.771
Do you want me to come in with you?

50:27.895 --> 50:29.896
No, I'll be okay.

50:30.229 --> 50:32.087
Mommy!

50:32.187 --> 50:36.605
Daddy's here. And he brought doughnuts!

50:41.853 --> 50:46.688
<i>Nothing concentrates the attention more
than an animal that can kill you.</i>

50:48.228 --> 50:50.753
Girls, you know you're not supposed
to let anyone in the house when I'm away.

50:50.853 --> 50:53.545
- But, Mom, it's Daddy.
- And now Daddy needs to leave.

50:53.645 --> 50:55.146
Come on!

50:55.937 --> 50:57.021
Let's talk!

51:02.853 --> 51:06.021
- I'm in no mood, Runner.
- Vern Evelee told me.

51:06.145 --> 51:09.063
- You just sold the tiller.
- Yeah.

51:09.478 --> 51:12.170
And that money's gone.
That money is gone as quick as I get it.

51:12.270 --> 51:16.063
- You should know that.
- You're never as broke as you say.

51:17.770 --> 51:20.938
I just need enough cash to get to Texas.

51:21.062 --> 51:24.938
- I'm sorry, I can't help you.
- Patty, I'm in a real jam here.

51:25.895 --> 51:28.771
- This is life or death stuff.
- Runner...

51:29.353 --> 51:32.271
I am dealing with some really bad stuff.

51:32.395 --> 51:35.271
- Oh, really?
- Ben is in big trouble.

51:36.062 --> 51:38.938
It's bad. He'll need a lawyer.

51:40.270 --> 51:42.854
So you do have money.

51:43.228 --> 51:45.188
No, I don't.

51:45.437 --> 51:47.670
Lawyers cost money.

51:47.770 --> 51:51.837
Okay, you got jewelry, don't you? You got some
jewelry, what about that ring I gave you?

51:51.937 --> 51:53.462
- The engagement ring?
- Yeah, the engagement ring.

51:53.562 --> 51:56.104
If what was worth anything
I would have pawned it off years ago.

51:56.228 --> 51:59.962
What about this? What about this?
Those are real rubies, right?

52:00.062 --> 52:02.587
That is my grandmother's cross and
you know how much that means to me

52:02.687 --> 52:04.396
and that stays in my family.

52:04.520 --> 52:07.979
You're going to be really sorry, Patty.

52:08.562 --> 52:11.104
I've been sorry a long time.

52:28.728 --> 52:30.545
Bye, girls.

52:30.645 --> 52:34.479
Your mom is a cunt!

52:36.312 --> 52:38.563
Thanks for fucking nothing!

53:07.728 --> 53:10.229
We don't open for another hour.

53:12.312 --> 53:16.545
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
This is a men's hostel.

53:16.645 --> 53:20.545
I'm looking for someone.
Runner Day. Are you the manager?

53:20.645 --> 53:23.212
Manager, accountant, priest.

53:23.312 --> 53:24.920
But he's gone again.

53:25.020 --> 53:28.212
I don't allow drinkers here,
and he just got his third strike.

53:28.312 --> 53:29.771
You know where I could find him?

53:29.895 --> 53:33.188
Well, I would bet anything
he's living at that toxic waste site.

53:33.312 --> 53:36.813
That's an old dumping spot
for grasshopper bait.

53:36.937 --> 53:38.979
Loaded with arsenic.

53:39.395 --> 53:42.229
Just prepare yourself
for some disappointment.

53:49.728 --> 53:51.854
<i>I wonder what it said about me?</i>

53:54.937 --> 53:58.646
<i>That my own father was living
in a toxic waste dump.</i>

55:11.895 --> 55:14.896
- Don't even think about...
- Put the gun down!

55:15.686 --> 55:17.562
It's your daughter!

55:19.645 --> 55:21.396
Prove it.

55:22.978 --> 55:24.354
I can't prove it.

55:32.561 --> 55:35.896
Well, well, come on down.

55:44.270 --> 55:46.229
Come on down!

56:00.686 --> 56:02.479
- No, don't touch me.
- Daddy's got ya.

56:02.603 --> 56:04.461
- Get your hands off me!
- Remember when you were a little girl?

56:04.561 --> 56:07.312
- Runner! No! No!
- Say uncle!

56:07.436 --> 56:09.062
- Let me go! No!
- Say uncle!

56:09.186 --> 56:11.729
- Say uncle!
- Uncle! Fuck!

56:22.436 --> 56:24.104
Jesus.

56:26.728 --> 56:29.437
How long has it been
since I've seen you?

56:31.061 --> 56:34.687
Do you remember
that flamingo ashtray I sent you?

56:35.395 --> 56:38.562
Yeah, when I was 10 years old
and a non-smoker.

56:38.811 --> 56:40.646
Nice?

56:45.020 --> 56:47.187
You know why I'm here, Runner.

56:49.686 --> 56:53.062
It's time you tell the truth
about the murders.

56:58.020 --> 57:00.295
Ben was no babe in the woods.

57:00.395 --> 57:03.937
You hang with the devil and sooner
or later you're going to have to pay.

57:04.561 --> 57:07.771
I should have known it, as soon
as I saw him with that goddamn Injun.

57:08.103 --> 57:11.104
- Who?
- Trey Teepano.

57:13.270 --> 57:15.229
You know what? Boy!

57:15.353 --> 57:18.646
People don't know shit about
what really happened that night.

57:21.770 --> 57:24.187
Who ended up with the money?

57:25.603 --> 57:28.521
- 'Cause it sure as hell wasn't me.
- You know we had no money.

57:28.645 --> 57:32.687
Your mom had money.
Your queen bitch mom!

57:33.020 --> 57:36.604
What happened to Patty's life insurance
money? 'Cause I sure as shit didn't get it.

57:36.728 --> 57:39.104
You know it went to Diane.
She used it to defend Ben.

57:39.228 --> 57:42.604
I worked years on that farm
and I never received a dime!

57:43.019 --> 57:45.020
That bitch even asked me for alimony!

57:47.269 --> 57:49.354
Is that what happened?

57:51.811 --> 57:54.770
You go there that night,
ask her for money?

57:56.228 --> 57:58.229
Get in a fight.

57:58.561 --> 58:03.437
What I'm trying to tell you is that Trey
was a bookie who needed to get paid.

58:03.728 --> 58:07.645
- And what, you owed him money?
- No, no, no.

58:07.769 --> 58:10.229
You want everything for free.

58:10.603 --> 58:13.895
And you wrote that book.
You wrote a book, right?

58:14.019 --> 58:15.895
- So you have got money!
- I don't have...

58:16.019 --> 58:19.479
- You've got money.
- Get your fucking hands off me!

58:22.394 --> 58:23.437
Fuck!

58:28.228 --> 58:30.229
Are you scared of me?

58:39.978 --> 58:42.145
Where were you that night, Runner?

58:44.019 --> 58:46.270
I don't remember a thing.

59:04.603 --> 59:08.187
Hey, did they ever find Diadra?

59:11.061 --> 59:12.336
You mean Diondra?

59:12.436 --> 59:14.770
I always wondered
if they killed her that night.

59:16.936 --> 59:19.020
What are you talking about?

59:19.519 --> 59:21.229
That's what they do, don't they?

59:21.728 --> 59:23.895
Devil worshipers?

59:24.019 --> 59:27.729
They kill pregnant ladies
and their babies.

59:40.769 --> 59:42.520
You are.

59:44.811 --> 59:46.687
Hey, Runner.

59:49.061 --> 59:50.419
Come here.

59:50.519 --> 59:54.711
I don't have it, man.
I tried to scrape it together.

59:54.811 --> 59:56.604
I did, but I just don't.

59:56.728 --> 59:59.395
Hey, honey. You gonna say hi to me?

01:00:00.603 --> 01:00:02.628
Diondra. I must be oblivious here,

01:00:02.728 --> 01:00:05.628
I'm drinking myself cross-eyed because
I'm so worried about this situation.

01:00:05.728 --> 01:00:07.937
See, I don't get it Runner.
You say you don't have any money,

01:00:08.061 --> 01:00:10.669
yet you had that giant stack of weed
just a few weeks ago.

01:00:10.769 --> 01:00:13.003
I didn't charge you nothin'.

01:00:13.103 --> 01:00:16.562
Because you owe me! You guys love
to gamble, but you never want to pay!

01:00:16.686 --> 01:00:18.711
I would say
that's an exaggeration, Trey.

01:00:18.811 --> 01:00:22.020
I know someone else who needs money.

01:00:24.561 --> 01:00:28.503
God. Look at this black hair you have.

01:00:28.603 --> 01:00:31.270
I didn't know you knew Trey.
You owe him money?

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:33.211
No, I don't owe him anything.

01:00:33.311 --> 01:00:36.479
He wants money for his girl.
Tomorrow night.

01:00:36.978 --> 01:00:39.437
Here. Or so help me, Runner...

01:00:40.311 --> 01:00:41.395
I will hurt you.

01:00:44.519 --> 01:00:46.770
Hey, I want to tell you something.

01:00:47.519 --> 01:00:51.770
- What?
- I... I got Diondra... She's...

01:00:52.394 --> 01:00:55.229
I got her pregnant. We're having a baby.

01:00:58.561 --> 01:01:00.604
Make sure it's yours.

01:01:01.186 --> 01:01:03.770
Okay? 'Cause I doubt it is.

01:01:05.603 --> 01:01:06.836
Look...

01:01:06.936 --> 01:01:11.478
Why would a rich slut like her
hang around a loser like you?

01:01:13.269 --> 01:01:15.103
Think about it.

01:01:29.227 --> 01:01:31.228
You okay, baby?

01:01:33.102 --> 01:01:35.312
Someone should fucking die.

01:01:38.644 --> 01:01:40.520
You got anything?

01:01:41.936 --> 01:01:43.937
In the glove compartment.

01:01:59.811 --> 01:02:01.502
What is that stuff?

01:02:01.602 --> 01:02:04.270
Devil's rush. Ever had it?

01:02:13.477 --> 01:02:16.044
- Come on.
- No, man. I don't need it.

01:02:16.144 --> 01:02:19.895
You're gonna need it, do it.
Maybe later you become a man?

01:02:20.352 --> 01:02:21.544
Maybe.

01:02:21.644 --> 01:02:24.520
Come on, baby. Come on.

01:02:28.602 --> 01:02:30.228
Yeah!

01:02:33.186 --> 01:02:36.728
- No, I want the axe!
- Too heavy for you.

01:02:41.686 --> 01:02:44.812
It's sharp, so don't fuck around.

01:03:00.519 --> 01:03:04.211
To Satan, we bring our sacrifices.

01:03:04.311 --> 01:03:07.395
We bring pain, blood, fear...

01:03:08.852 --> 01:03:11.437
rage. Basis of human life.

01:03:12.936 --> 01:03:16.336
In your power, we become more powerful.

01:03:16.436 --> 01:03:18.228
That one.

01:03:18.644 --> 01:03:22.520
In your exaltation, we become exalted.

01:03:26.394 --> 01:03:29.770
We're going to make your baby
a fucking warrior tonight, Dio!

01:03:36.769 --> 01:03:38.062
Come on, baby!

01:03:38.186 --> 01:03:41.645
You can't just fucking stand there,
it's time to get your kill!

01:03:43.394 --> 01:03:45.812
This is your chance, dude. Be a man!

01:03:46.019 --> 01:03:49.812
I used to be like you. I don't
ever want to go back there again!

01:03:50.561 --> 01:03:53.711
Don't be a scared,
dickless boy the rest of your life!

01:03:53.811 --> 01:03:56.270
Aren't you tired of being scared?

01:03:56.727 --> 01:03:58.478
Come on!

01:04:04.602 --> 01:04:07.336
- You trust Runner over me?
- I don't trust anyone.

01:04:07.436 --> 01:04:10.270
How much? How much money
are they paying you?

01:04:11.269 --> 01:04:13.978
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You thought I didn't know about that?

01:04:14.102 --> 01:04:16.603
Yeah, I got paid.
It's not about that anymore.

01:04:16.727 --> 01:04:19.794
What is it about, the truth?
Listen, there's no way you can win this.

01:04:19.894 --> 01:04:24.294
If I tell you I'm innocent,
that means you ruined my life, sister.

01:04:24.394 --> 01:04:26.770
And if I tell you I'm guilty, that doesn't
make you feel much better now...

01:04:26.894 --> 01:04:28.627
- Where's Diondra?
- Oh, let it go. I have.

01:04:28.727 --> 01:04:31.353
- What'd you do with the baby, Ben?
- What baby?

01:04:31.727 --> 01:04:34.127
- Are you going to keep bullshitting me?
- Let it go, Libby.

01:04:34.227 --> 01:04:35.544
What about Trey Teepano?

01:04:35.644 --> 01:04:38.603
He said what he had to say
on the witness stand.

01:04:38.727 --> 01:04:40.645
That's too easy.

01:04:41.394 --> 01:04:43.335
You listen to me.

01:04:43.435 --> 01:04:47.145
Today... I can forgive your past lie.

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:49.936
For being confused as a kid.

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:52.728
But god damn it, you're a grown-up now.

01:04:53.144 --> 01:04:55.544
Do you really think that our blood
could do something like that?

01:04:55.644 --> 01:04:58.228
I totally believe our blood
could do something like that.

01:04:58.352 --> 01:05:00.561
I've beaten the shit out of people, Ben.

01:05:00.685 --> 01:05:03.895
I've busted in doors and windows,
I've killed things!

01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:09.103
Half the time I look down
and my hands are in fists.

01:05:10.810 --> 01:05:14.460
- Do you really believe we're that bad?
- I do.

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:16.770
Even with Mom's blood.

01:05:18.394 --> 01:05:20.020
Even with.

01:05:22.352 --> 01:05:26.103
- Then I'm sad for you, little girl.
- Go fuck yourself!

01:05:26.519 --> 01:05:29.669
- Is that funny to you?
- No. It's ironic.

01:05:29.769 --> 01:05:31.710
What?

01:05:31.810 --> 01:05:34.395
You're just as imprisoned as I am.

01:06:10.935 --> 01:06:15.210
- It's okay, sweetie.
- No, it's not. I want Ben back.

01:06:15.310 --> 01:06:19.645
Why can't we find him?
Is he in trouble because of his hair?

01:06:19.977 --> 01:06:22.395
No, it's because of sex.
Everyone at school knows.

01:06:23.894 --> 01:06:25.603
What are you talking about?

01:06:27.935 --> 01:06:29.895
Ben is your brother, you don't talk
hateful about your brother.

01:06:30.019 --> 01:06:32.294
But, Mom, I don't like Ben!

01:06:32.394 --> 01:06:35.145
He's bad, he does bad things!

01:06:39.477 --> 01:06:43.544
Has he ever touched you in a strange way
or an unbrotherly way?

01:06:43.644 --> 01:06:47.335
The only time he touches me
is when he's pushing me or pulling my hair.

01:06:47.435 --> 01:06:48.877
Mom, he's a freak!

01:06:48.977 --> 01:06:52.603
It's embarrassing, just go in his room,
he's got all sorts of weird stuff.

01:06:53.394 --> 01:06:55.436
You snooped in his room?

01:08:17.352 --> 01:08:21.667
- Hello?
- <i>Patty? It's Joseph, from the FHA.</i>

01:08:21.768 --> 01:08:25.060
Joseph, I can't find the money.
I've had a rough day.

01:08:25.185 --> 01:08:29.269
<i>Yes, I heard about Ben.
I wasn't going to phone you.</i>

01:08:29.393 --> 01:08:32.335
<i>But how should I say this.
Patty, I trust you.</i>

01:08:32.435 --> 01:08:34.435
<i>I pray for you.</i>

01:08:34.727 --> 01:08:37.185
<i>I may have a solution to your problem.</i>

01:08:37.310 --> 01:08:39.877
I thought we were out of options.

01:08:39.977 --> 01:08:42.019
<i>Not entirely.</i>

01:08:43.935 --> 01:08:45.292
- Yeah.
- <i>Libby, Libby.</i>

01:08:45.393 --> 01:08:48.728
<i>We found Diondra Sue Wertzner.
Born on March 28th, 1968.</i>

01:08:48.852 --> 01:08:53.627
<i>Was officially reported missing on October
19th, 1985, and has never been found.</i>

01:08:53.727 --> 01:08:56.060
So what the fuck does that mean?
She's dead?

01:08:56.185 --> 01:08:59.519
<i>I don't know, we can't be sure.
But did Ben tell you anything?</i>

01:09:01.102 --> 01:09:02.810
Hang on.

01:09:16.143 --> 01:09:17.853
Hey.

01:09:18.518 --> 01:09:20.353
Told you I'd pay you back.

01:09:21.268 --> 01:09:23.769
When I saw your name on that note...

01:09:23.893 --> 01:09:28.210
I should have recognized you right away,
but... I kinda followed your story,

01:09:28.310 --> 01:09:31.644
- but it's been such a long time ago.
- What do you want?

01:09:33.935 --> 01:09:36.810
You're not gonna make this
easy for me, are you?

01:09:39.435 --> 01:09:41.269
Fair enough.

01:09:43.393 --> 01:09:45.502
<i>I was a pretty girl.</i>

01:09:45.602 --> 01:09:47.377
<i>I was good in school.</i>

01:09:47.477 --> 01:09:50.542
<i>And Ben... he did volunteer work.</i>

01:09:50.643 --> 01:09:52.894
<i>He gave drawing lessons.</i>

01:09:53.268 --> 01:09:55.561
<i>I had a big crush on him.</i>

01:09:56.018 --> 01:09:58.377
<i>We started hanging out together.</i>

01:09:58.477 --> 01:10:01.418
<i>I know we were both kids,
but he was old enough...</i>

01:10:01.518 --> 01:10:03.769
<i>to not have encouraged me.</i>

01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:11.144
It was my first big grown-up kiss.

01:10:11.602 --> 01:10:14.061
It only lasted about a second.

01:10:14.185 --> 01:10:18.043
And afterwards, of course, he told me
that we should never do it again,

01:10:18.143 --> 01:10:20.228
'cause it was wrong.

01:10:21.518 --> 01:10:23.686
But he kept writing me notes.

01:10:23.977 --> 01:10:26.853
But he refused to spend
any more time with me.

01:10:27.393 --> 01:10:29.478
And I was furious.

01:10:29.893 --> 01:10:34.668
Then, about a week later
I went to a slumber party

01:10:34.768 --> 01:10:37.353
and I told all the girls
about my high school boyfriend.

01:10:38.352 --> 01:10:40.353
All proud.

01:10:41.143 --> 01:10:43.519
And I made up things that we did.

01:10:43.643 --> 01:10:46.394
And from there it just snowballed.

01:10:46.518 --> 01:10:51.228
We made up this whole imaginary world,
where Ben was a devil worshiper.

01:10:51.602 --> 01:10:55.686
Kind of stories we saw on the news
every day when we were kids.

01:11:21.185 --> 01:11:22.936
Ma'am.

01:11:24.810 --> 01:11:27.668
Your son is about to be arrested,
and I know what for.

01:11:27.768 --> 01:11:31.835
In this next year you will need some money
so you can keep your children at home.

01:11:31.935 --> 01:11:33.644
And you will need a good lawyer...

01:11:34.143 --> 01:11:38.210
'cause you don't want your son
going to prison labeled a child molester.

01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:39.811
What do you have to offer?

01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:45.352
Now I myself was once a farmer.
My dad before me and his dad before him.

01:11:46.393 --> 01:11:48.394
But we farmers, we'd been swindled.

01:11:48.518 --> 01:11:51.102
"Plant fence post to fence post,"
they said.

01:11:51.226 --> 01:11:54.894
"Oh, and then buy more land, because,
well, they ain't making any more of it."

01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:59.519
Then, whoops. "We're sorry,
we gave you some bad advice.

01:12:00.393 --> 01:12:02.644
"We'll just take your farm."

01:12:03.351 --> 01:12:05.852
What does this have to do with my son?

01:12:07.810 --> 01:12:10.686
Ma'am. I'm no businessman.

01:12:11.685 --> 01:12:13.602
And I'm no judge.

01:12:14.101 --> 01:12:16.710
I'm certainly no politician.

01:12:16.810 --> 01:12:19.102
But if you're brave enough...

01:12:19.226 --> 01:12:21.894
I'll give you a real chance
to help your family.

01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:43.710
Your brother needs you, Libby.

01:13:43.810 --> 01:13:45.977
He doesn't, and he's been
pretty clear about that.

01:13:46.393 --> 01:13:49.460
Now that you've explored the case
with all its inconsistencies,

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:52.561
don't you think that Ben deserves
a new, fair trial?

01:13:52.935 --> 01:13:55.144
Based on what evidence?

01:13:55.268 --> 01:13:57.769
What do we know for sure?
He's lying about Diondra. Why?

01:13:57.893 --> 01:14:01.894
But, everybody's a liar.
I lied to get you to KC.

01:14:02.226 --> 01:14:05.668
You lied when you said you saw what happened
that day, it doesn't make us murderers.

01:14:05.768 --> 01:14:08.644
What makes you so sure I lied?

01:14:11.893 --> 01:14:15.144
Why are you so obsessed with this case?

01:14:15.268 --> 01:14:17.852
It's not even your story, it's mine.

01:14:19.185 --> 01:14:23.168
It's a fascinating puzzle, a mystery
with lots of different theories.

01:14:23.268 --> 01:14:26.936
Most of all, there's you
and Ben and Krissi.

01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:31.460
Kids who started events that became bigger
than them and had major repercussions.

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:34.477
- I'm fascinated by that.
- Why?

01:14:38.768 --> 01:14:42.269
You ever heard about those wildfires
near San Bernardino in 1999?

01:14:42.393 --> 01:14:46.210
They destroyed, like, 80 homes
and about 90,000 acres?

01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:48.977
I don't know, seems like California
is always burning.

01:14:50.393 --> 01:14:52.936
I was the kid who set that fire.

01:14:56.851 --> 01:14:59.061
Then shouldn't you have become
a firefighter or something,

01:14:59.185 --> 01:15:01.436
overcome your trauma that way?

01:15:07.893 --> 01:15:10.852
- So, did you?
- Did I what?

01:15:11.309 --> 01:15:13.352
Did you lie that day in court?

01:15:32.726 --> 01:15:34.394
Hello?

01:15:40.393 --> 01:15:42.060
Hello?

01:15:51.393 --> 01:15:53.102
- Can I help you?
- Hey.

01:15:53.226 --> 01:15:55.435
We're looking for Trey Teepano.

01:15:55.559 --> 01:15:57.043
That'd be me.

01:15:57.143 --> 01:15:59.810
Want to talk to you about Ben Day.
My brother.

01:16:13.226 --> 01:16:16.626
You're the one who lived? Debbie?

01:16:16.726 --> 01:16:18.269
Libby.

01:16:18.809 --> 01:16:21.060
You remember Runner Day?

01:16:21.393 --> 01:16:23.560
He said you were a bookie
or something, back then.

01:16:24.393 --> 01:16:27.060
Yeah. Runner owed me a lot of money.

01:16:28.476 --> 01:16:30.810
Still does, I guess.

01:16:32.184 --> 01:16:34.894
It doesn't mean I know what happened
in your house that night.

01:16:35.268 --> 01:16:38.834
- You were into devil worshiping?
- I'm reformed now.

01:16:38.934 --> 01:16:41.769
I'm a good God-fearin' Indian.

01:16:44.226 --> 01:16:47.019
You remember Diondra Wertzner?

01:16:47.893 --> 01:16:49.668
Your brother...

01:16:49.768 --> 01:16:52.001
Your brother was crazy about that girl.

01:16:52.101 --> 01:16:55.668
Parents neglected her,
so she was always creating drama.

01:16:55.768 --> 01:16:59.584
She'd run away, come back home.
Total soap opera.

01:16:59.684 --> 01:17:01.685
This time, I guess,
she just ran away for good?

01:17:01.851 --> 01:17:05.501
She's been listed
as a missing person for 25 years.

01:17:05.601 --> 01:17:08.852
Yeah, she was one of them girls
who was always trying to be someone else.

01:17:08.976 --> 01:17:13.477
Yeah, she'd talk in an English accent
one day and next day it'd be Southern.

01:17:14.059 --> 01:17:15.626
She liked to use her porn name, too.

01:17:15.726 --> 01:17:19.418
- She did porn?
- No. It was that game.

01:17:19.518 --> 01:17:21.977
What was the name of your childhood pet?

01:17:24.351 --> 01:17:25.293
Crazy.

01:17:25.393 --> 01:17:26.751
What was the name of the street
you grew up on?

01:17:26.851 --> 01:17:28.935
Rural Route 2.

01:17:30.226 --> 01:17:33.834
Well, that's not going to work.
It's supposed to sound slutty.

01:17:33.934 --> 01:17:36.293
You know, like Bambi Evergreen.

01:17:36.393 --> 01:17:39.810
What was Diondra's...
It was... Polly something...

01:17:41.643 --> 01:17:42.977
Polly Palm.

01:17:44.559 --> 01:17:47.168
What was the name your brother
had tattooed on his arm?

01:17:47.268 --> 01:17:49.894
- Oh, my God!
- It was Polly, right?

01:17:51.476 --> 01:17:53.769
I got her. Polly Palm
in Kearney, Missouri.

01:17:53.893 --> 01:17:57.602
The only one listed in the whole country
apart for a nail boutique in Shreveport.

01:18:12.309 --> 01:18:15.102
<i>Something like me,
with open arms, I tell you...</i>

01:18:17.518 --> 01:18:21.310
I don't feel good.
I think I need something to eat.

01:18:26.226 --> 01:18:27.769
What?

01:18:29.476 --> 01:18:31.310
You're fucked.

01:18:32.184 --> 01:18:34.834
<i>Hey, Dio, it's Megan.
I'm totally freaked out about Ben Day.</i>

01:18:34.934 --> 01:18:37.060
<i>Did you hear he molested
all those girls?</i>

01:18:38.851 --> 01:18:41.893
<i>Hey, Diondra, it's Jenny.
I hear Ben's running from the cops.</i>

01:18:42.017 --> 01:18:44.852
<i>You're not with him, are you?
Please tell me you're not with him.</i>

01:18:54.726 --> 01:18:58.602
- I guess I should go home.
- Okay, and what?

01:18:58.726 --> 01:19:00.393
Leave me here while you go to jail?

01:19:00.726 --> 01:19:02.935
- What do you want me to do?
- We're leaving town tonight.

01:19:03.059 --> 01:19:06.810
I have like $200 left from my parents.
How much do you have at your place?

01:19:08.059 --> 01:19:12.209
I've got some saved up. My mom...
she's got, like, 500 or 600 lying around.

01:19:12.309 --> 01:19:15.560
- But I don't know where.
- Yeah, all right, we'll go there. Okay.

01:19:15.684 --> 01:19:18.501
If we don't see a cop car outside,
we'll go inside, we'll get the cash,

01:19:18.601 --> 01:19:21.667
we'll pack a bag and we'll get
the fuck out of here, okay?

01:19:21.767 --> 01:19:25.060
And then what?
What fucking planet are you on?

01:19:25.767 --> 01:19:28.060
Are you even sure this kid's mine?

01:19:28.559 --> 01:19:31.227
How dare you!

01:19:39.892 --> 01:19:41.477
Ben.

01:19:42.934 --> 01:19:46.102
Ben, baby, I love you, you know.

01:19:46.601 --> 01:19:48.209
And I swear to God this child's yours.

01:19:48.309 --> 01:19:50.459
I swear to God, but you got
to get me out of town, okay?

01:19:50.559 --> 01:19:53.727
And we gotta head west otherwise...
otherwise you're in jail.

01:19:54.934 --> 01:19:58.477
You're in jail and I'm dead from my daddy.
He'll make me have the baby...

01:19:58.976 --> 01:20:00.977
and then he'll kill me.

01:20:35.059 --> 01:20:36.310
Yeah?

01:20:38.226 --> 01:20:40.143
You know who I am?

01:20:43.226 --> 01:20:46.268
Holy crap! Libby.

01:20:46.809 --> 01:20:49.060
I always thought you'd find me someday.

01:20:49.559 --> 01:20:51.393
Smart girl.

01:20:53.351 --> 01:20:54.977
Stay!

01:20:55.351 --> 01:20:57.584
So this is out of the blue.

01:20:57.684 --> 01:21:01.643
I mean, why come looking for me now?
Did Ben say something to you?

01:21:02.601 --> 01:21:04.167
No, that's why I'm here.

01:21:04.267 --> 01:21:09.102
So you think that once you know
the truth... you'll find peace?

01:21:09.392 --> 01:21:12.227
Like, somehow that will fix you?

01:21:17.142 --> 01:21:19.310
I was with Ben that night.

01:21:20.559 --> 01:21:22.727
We were going to skip town.

01:21:22.851 --> 01:21:25.792
And he went to his house
to get some money.

01:21:25.892 --> 01:21:28.477
An hour goes by, two hours.

01:21:28.684 --> 01:21:31.393
Finally, I thought he lost his nerve.

01:21:32.267 --> 01:21:34.893
Cried myself to sleep that night.

01:21:37.101 --> 01:21:38.893
In the morning...

01:21:39.767 --> 01:21:41.352
when I heard about the murders.

01:21:42.601 --> 01:21:44.602
Packed my bags,

01:21:44.726 --> 01:21:48.935
left a note for my father telling him
I was not his little girl anymore.

01:21:49.601 --> 01:21:51.667
Skipped town for good.

01:21:51.767 --> 01:21:54.810
Ben never gave my name to the police.

01:21:57.101 --> 01:21:59.393
After all these years...

01:22:00.101 --> 01:22:02.268
he protected me.

01:22:08.267 --> 01:22:11.435
So, no one but him knows
what happened that night.

01:22:11.892 --> 01:22:16.185
I do think you that you could find
this peace that you're looking for

01:22:16.309 --> 01:22:18.226
if you accept that.

01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:20.060
Look, I hate to say this,

01:22:20.184 --> 01:22:24.518
but whatever happened,
and as much as I loved Ben...

01:22:26.225 --> 01:22:28.667
he needed to be in that prison.

01:22:28.767 --> 01:22:33.893
There was something inside your brother
that was not right for the outside world.

01:22:41.392 --> 01:22:43.226
You were pregnant.

01:22:48.559 --> 01:22:50.810
What happened to the baby?

01:22:51.392 --> 01:22:53.393
I'm here.

01:23:34.267 --> 01:23:37.351
What are you doing?
I told you to wait in the car.

01:23:39.559 --> 01:23:41.726
I know you did, but...

01:23:42.934 --> 01:23:46.000
- Baby, I'm hearing voices in my head.
- Hey, you got to be quiet, okay.

01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:48.625
- I don't want to be alone.
- I know.

01:23:48.725 --> 01:23:51.601
It's just the drugs.
They'll wear off, okay.

01:23:53.392 --> 01:23:54.726
I like your house.

01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:03.685
Be quiet.

01:24:14.725 --> 01:24:16.560
What's going on?

01:24:17.225 --> 01:24:19.393
Somebody's been in my room.

01:24:20.392 --> 01:24:22.101
Oh, God. You don't...

01:24:23.225 --> 01:24:25.709
You don't think it's the cops, do you?

01:24:25.809 --> 01:24:27.226
I don't know.

01:24:28.559 --> 01:24:30.893
I got a present for you, for the baby.

01:24:34.225 --> 01:24:36.560
- You got me a present?
- Yeah, but it's not here.

01:24:41.059 --> 01:24:42.768
Who is that?

01:24:42.892 --> 01:24:46.435
It's okay, it's just Libby,
she's going into Mom's room.

01:25:03.642 --> 01:25:05.351
There's less than I thought.

01:25:06.309 --> 01:25:08.893
I fucking know it was Michelle.

01:25:10.434 --> 01:25:14.018
It was Michelle that stole
my fucking present, that nosy little bitch.

01:25:19.559 --> 01:25:21.685
This doesn't feel right.

01:25:31.559 --> 01:25:34.518
- I knew it! I heard everything!
- Come here!

01:25:35.725 --> 01:25:37.685
Get out of my way.

01:25:38.433 --> 01:25:40.393
You don't say another word,
you little bitch!

01:25:40.517 --> 01:25:43.708
- Stop! Stop! She's not gonna say anything.
- Ben, get off me.

01:25:43.808 --> 01:25:45.268
Come here.

01:25:50.933 --> 01:25:53.184
Diondra, stop it! Stop!

01:25:55.058 --> 01:25:57.268
Dio, stop. You'll wake up
the whole fucking house.

01:25:57.392 --> 01:25:58.958
If you think I'm going to spend
my entire fucking life

01:25:59.058 --> 01:26:01.208
worrying about this little bitch,
you're wrong, Ben!

01:26:01.308 --> 01:26:04.125
Get off of her. Dio, stop. Listen to me.

01:26:04.225 --> 01:26:06.476
We'll talk to her, okay?
She'll understand. Stop.

01:26:08.017 --> 01:26:09.684
Ben?

01:26:10.058 --> 01:26:12.851
Hey! It's okay. Okay?

01:26:21.933 --> 01:26:24.643
I was never supposed to meet you.

01:26:26.183 --> 01:26:28.309
I'm a secret, you know.

01:26:31.267 --> 01:26:33.518
A secret love child.

01:26:34.267 --> 01:26:36.101
That's right, baby.

01:26:36.225 --> 01:26:39.143
Crystal knows the whole story.
I tell her everything.

01:26:39.558 --> 01:26:41.434
We're best friends.

01:26:41.725 --> 01:26:43.309
I read your book, too.

01:26:44.767 --> 01:26:48.226
I even have a little scrapbook
of photos of all of you.

01:26:48.892 --> 01:26:53.393
Clipped out of magazines and stuff.
It's like a fake family photo album.

01:26:58.100 --> 01:26:59.934
Can I call you Aunt Libby?

01:27:03.058 --> 01:27:07.101
I know, I know that this
is a lot to take in.

01:27:09.267 --> 01:27:11.559
You want a drink?

01:27:12.392 --> 01:27:17.018
- I need to use your bathroom.
- It's just up the stairs.

01:27:35.975 --> 01:27:37.250
- Yeah?
- <i>Libby.</i>

01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:39.518
I know the whole story now.
You need to hear this.

01:27:39.767 --> 01:27:41.958
- What are you talking about?
- <i>You remember the theory</i>

01:27:42.058 --> 01:27:45.000
the Kill Club had about the serial killer
they called the Angel of Debt?

01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:48.042
- Yeah?
- <i>They got him, I mean, we got him.</i>

01:27:48.142 --> 01:27:52.333
One of our members posed as a bankrupt
hedge fund manager in a suburb of Chicago

01:27:52.433 --> 01:27:55.333
and this guy Calvin Diehl,
tried to help him stage his death.

01:27:55.433 --> 01:27:58.667
<i>Diehl used to be a farmer who lost everything
to the banks in the Soviet embargo.</i>

01:27:58.767 --> 01:28:01.393
- So what?
- He's been at it since the '80s.

01:28:01.517 --> 01:28:04.143
Making suicides look like
accidents or murders.

01:28:04.642 --> 01:28:06.393
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:28:07.308 --> 01:28:09.893
Your mother had hired him
for that night.

01:28:13.308 --> 01:28:14.934
Are you sure?

01:28:18.058 --> 01:28:21.583
Listen, Lyle, can you come get me?

01:28:21.683 --> 01:28:23.393
<i>Okay.</i>

01:28:23.767 --> 01:28:25.042
- Libby?
- Yeah?

01:28:25.142 --> 01:28:29.059
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I just need a second.

01:28:29.975 --> 01:28:34.434
- I'm sorry, but I really need to go.
- I'll be out in a second, okay?

01:28:40.350 --> 01:28:41.934
Fuck!

01:29:11.516 --> 01:29:13.351
Libby?

01:29:13.933 --> 01:29:17.434
Yeah. Yeah, I'm coming.

01:29:28.808 --> 01:29:30.666
You okay?

01:29:30.766 --> 01:29:32.767
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:29:32.891 --> 01:29:35.392
Listen, I'm gonna wait outside,
my friend is coming for me.

01:29:35.516 --> 01:29:39.208
I really need you to keep this
a secret, okay? I can't risk it.

01:29:39.308 --> 01:29:41.559
Them thinking I'm an accomplice,
you understand?

01:29:41.850 --> 01:29:45.892
Why would they think that?
Were you at the house that night?

01:29:52.891 --> 01:29:54.392
No!

01:30:35.850 --> 01:30:39.226
Don't worry, it'll all be over
in about 30 seconds.

01:30:42.725 --> 01:30:43.958
Go tell Mom.

01:30:44.058 --> 01:30:46.934
- Come here!
- Get the fuck off her!

01:30:52.016 --> 01:30:55.625
- What the hell?
- Mom, they're hurting Michelle!

01:30:55.725 --> 01:30:57.809
Run! Run!

01:31:01.683 --> 01:31:04.476
No! No, please don't! No!

01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:08.500
Why'd you make me do this?

01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:11.309
- No! No, please. No!
- This wasn't the plan.

01:31:13.266 --> 01:31:14.809
Get the fuck off of her.

01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:28.684
Oh, my God!

01:32:00.433 --> 01:32:03.791
Mom, I'm sorry. I saw the cross
was gone and I panicked.

01:32:03.891 --> 01:32:07.934
It's okay, sweetie.
Go get the gun. It's in the cabinet.

01:32:10.391 --> 01:32:13.875
- Where is it? I can't find it!
- It's in the box on the left side.

01:32:13.975 --> 01:32:15.226
I'm looking there, Mom, it's not there.

01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:17.392
- Well, look harder!
- I am looking!

01:32:26.016 --> 01:32:28.267
What did you do to her?

01:32:29.433 --> 01:32:31.875
- I'm calling the police.
- Wait. Wait, listen.

01:32:31.975 --> 01:32:36.226
She wouldn't shut up, all right?
It's her fault, she wouldn't shut up!

01:32:37.641 --> 01:32:41.434
- Where's the little one?
- Oh, shit! Libby!

01:32:41.808 --> 01:32:43.684
Libby!

01:32:44.558 --> 01:32:46.184
It's gotta be in here!

01:32:51.724 --> 01:32:55.642
Stop yelling at me! How am I supposed
to find anything in this crap?

01:32:55.766 --> 01:32:58.166
- I see it, it's right there.
- Okay, where are the bullets?

01:32:58.266 --> 01:33:00.934
- Where are the bullets?
- No, it's loaded, it's fine!

01:33:01.058 --> 01:33:02.475
Mom! Mom!

01:33:11.391 --> 01:33:12.934
Libby?

01:33:59.349 --> 01:34:02.059
Hey! Let me do it! Let me do it!

01:34:03.058 --> 01:34:05.350
Bitch blocked the door!

01:34:05.808 --> 01:34:07.434
Christ!

01:34:08.224 --> 01:34:10.142
Can you squeeze through?

01:34:24.308 --> 01:34:26.850
- Oh, my God! She got out!
- Grab the gun!

01:34:35.849 --> 01:34:37.642
Damn it!

01:34:40.433 --> 01:34:42.083
Libby! Libby!

01:34:42.183 --> 01:34:44.791
Ben, if she saw something,
we got a problem!

01:34:44.891 --> 01:34:48.208
Ben, baby... Don't you see
how this isn't a coincidence?

01:34:48.308 --> 01:34:49.874
We need money, then we do
the ritual and then, pow!

01:34:49.974 --> 01:34:53.225
- Someone kills your entire family!
- What are you talking about?

01:34:53.391 --> 01:34:56.434
You inherit all your mom's life insurance.
Whatever you want to do, baby,

01:34:56.558 --> 01:34:59.958
you want to go to California, you want
to live on the beach, we can do it!

01:35:00.058 --> 01:35:01.725
Together.

01:35:04.224 --> 01:35:07.392
If you want me to,
I can take care of her myself.

01:35:09.516 --> 01:35:11.392
No, I'll get her.

01:36:20.224 --> 01:36:23.975
Mom, we're not going to find her.
She could be anywhere by now.

01:36:24.516 --> 01:36:25.791
She can't be far.

01:36:25.891 --> 01:36:28.832
Her friend is coming.
What if he called the cops?

01:36:28.932 --> 01:36:30.975
We have to go.

01:36:32.599 --> 01:36:34.725
What if they find us?

01:36:50.557 --> 01:36:55.350
Libby? Stay where you are,
sweetheart, okay. Stay there.

01:37:48.766 --> 01:37:50.350
Libby!

01:37:55.266 --> 01:37:57.100
Libby!

01:38:06.224 --> 01:38:08.683
I love you, Libby.

01:38:10.057 --> 01:38:12.392
I love you, ladybug.

01:38:12.516 --> 01:38:15.183
Don't you ever forget that.

01:38:18.474 --> 01:38:20.308
Libby!

01:38:23.557 --> 01:38:25.433
Libby!

01:38:29.432 --> 01:38:32.975
- Libby, you okay? What happened?
- Where are they?

01:38:33.266 --> 01:38:35.517
There's no one here,
I checked the house.

01:38:36.099 --> 01:38:39.350
It's okay. Everything's okay.

01:38:46.141 --> 01:38:50.624
<i>Diondra Wertzner, also known as Polly Palm
was arrested last night in Amarillo, Texas.</i>

01:38:50.724 --> 01:38:55.207
<i>This is the latest development
in the 1985 Kansas Prairie Massacre case.</i>

01:38:55.307 --> 01:38:58.874
<i>Ms. Wertzner was wanted in relation
to the murder of Michelle Day</i>

01:38:58.974 --> 01:39:03.124
<i>for which Ben Day, her brother,
has been in prison for the last 28 years.</i>

01:39:03.224 --> 01:39:07.041
<i>She denies any involvement
while DNA analysis is pending.</i>

01:39:07.141 --> 01:39:08.957
<i>But it was announced
this morning that Ben Day</i>

01:39:09.057 --> 01:39:11.183
<i>will be released from prison shortly.</i>

01:39:11.307 --> 01:39:14.058
<i>Their daughter, Crystal,
is still at large.</i>

01:39:14.182 --> 01:39:17.041
<i>As a reminder, this is
the latest twist in a larger case,</i>

01:39:17.141 --> 01:39:21.332
<i>that of serial killer Calvin Diehl,
aka the Angel of Debt</i>

01:39:21.432 --> 01:39:24.957
<i>who has killed, or as he claims,
"Helped to die in dignity,"</i>

01:39:25.057 --> 01:39:28.499
<i>more than 50 people
since the early 1980s.</i>

01:39:28.599 --> 01:39:32.874
<i>He had each of his victims sign
what he termed a "permission to kill" form</i>

01:39:32.974 --> 01:39:35.392
<i>along with a letter to loved ones.</i>

01:39:39.307 --> 01:39:42.558
<i>Dear Ben, Michelle, Libby and Debby.</i>

01:39:42.682 --> 01:39:45.207
<i>I don't think this letter
will ever reach you.</i>

01:39:45.307 --> 01:39:47.957
<i>But Mr. Diehl said he'd hold it for me.</i>

01:39:48.057 --> 01:39:50.766
<i>And I guess that gives me some comfort.</i>

01:39:51.349 --> 01:39:55.058
<i>Your grandparents always told me,
"Make a useful life."</i>

01:39:55.182 --> 01:39:57.374
<i>I don't think I've really done that,</i>

01:39:57.474 --> 01:39:59.957
<i>but I can make a useful death.</i>

01:40:00.057 --> 01:40:03.725
<i>My life has been determined
so much by accidents.</i>

01:40:03.849 --> 01:40:08.933
<i>It seems nice now that an accident
on purpose will make things right again.</i>

01:40:09.974 --> 01:40:12.225
<i>I hope you all forgive me.</i>

01:40:13.557 --> 01:40:15.891
<i>Take care of yourselves.</i>

01:40:16.224 --> 01:40:19.058
<i>I know Diane will do right by you.</i>

01:40:19.182 --> 01:40:23.891
<i>I'm only sad... I won't get to see
the wonderful people you've become.</i>

01:40:24.349 --> 01:40:26.457
<i>Although I don't need to.</i>

01:40:26.557 --> 01:40:29.308
<i>That's how sure I am of my kids.</i>

01:40:56.349 --> 01:40:59.058
Diondra was always sure you'd find her.
She was sure of it.

01:41:00.432 --> 01:41:02.350
Guess she was right.

01:41:05.557 --> 01:41:07.308
So you met my daughter.

01:41:12.724 --> 01:41:15.308
I've heard different things. Is she...

01:41:15.724 --> 01:41:18.516
Is she like Diondra? Is she bad?

01:41:20.224 --> 01:41:22.100
I don't know.

01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:26.665
How does a girl deal with the fact
that she knows her mother is a murderer?

01:41:26.765 --> 01:41:30.225
She can't disappear for long,
I can find her.

01:41:30.682 --> 01:41:33.183
She's not going to go
to jail because of me.

01:41:36.349 --> 01:41:37.790
You'd really give her a pass?

01:41:37.890 --> 01:41:42.624
I know a little bit about people trying to do
the right thing and completely fucking up.

01:41:42.724 --> 01:41:46.725
- Are you talking about me or Mom?
- I'm talking about me.

01:41:47.432 --> 01:41:49.725
You could've been talking
about any of us.

01:41:50.015 --> 01:41:53.058
28 years I've been shutting up
and taking it.

01:41:54.307 --> 01:41:57.391
28 years I've been protecting
a kid that I never met.

01:41:58.099 --> 01:41:59.933
By leaving her
with your sister's murderer?

01:42:00.057 --> 01:42:03.391
I never said I did the right thing, but
I made a choice and I had to live with it.

01:42:03.515 --> 01:42:05.891
Yeah, I had to live with it, too.

01:42:07.140 --> 01:42:10.891
But I do wish there was something
I could say to make it better.

01:42:11.807 --> 01:42:14.016
There's nothing left to say.

01:42:15.682 --> 01:42:19.391
You lied. I lied.

01:42:21.765 --> 01:42:23.641
We're even.

01:42:30.599 --> 01:42:32.433
What about us?

01:42:35.599 --> 01:42:37.766
You don't know me, Ben.

01:42:38.474 --> 01:42:41.016
You think you do, but you don't.

01:42:42.224 --> 01:42:44.308
Just like I don't know you.

01:42:46.807 --> 01:42:50.475
Or Mom. Or Debby, or Michelle.

01:42:53.015 --> 01:42:57.100
Whatever sliver of a memory I had
of them died with them that night.

01:43:03.182 --> 01:43:06.225
I'm so angry at you.

01:43:13.265 --> 01:43:15.516
But you're still my brother.

01:43:17.432 --> 01:43:19.474
You're still my blood.

01:43:20.890 --> 01:43:24.058
I won't let what happened that night,
drive my life anymore.

01:43:27.473 --> 01:43:29.933
I just want to be normal.

01:43:34.807 --> 01:43:36.516
I'm sorry.

01:43:36.932 --> 01:43:40.349
I'm sorry, Libby. I'm sorry.

01:43:55.973 --> 01:43:58.123
You know that horse
you were talking about, Yellow?

01:43:58.223 --> 01:43:59.891
Yeah, what about him?

01:44:01.807 --> 01:44:03.599
I don't get it.

01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:06.974
Why Yellow?

01:44:08.973 --> 01:44:10.957
<i>I don't know. Mom named him.</i>

01:44:11.057 --> 01:44:13.933
<i>It's not like he was
a yellow horse or anything.</i>

01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:18.391
<i>I guess she'll keep
that secret with her?</i>

01:44:18.765 --> 01:44:20.808
<i>There's a lot of other stories, Libby.</i>

01:44:21.307 --> 01:44:23.183
Beautiful ones.

01:44:23.557 --> 01:44:25.808
Wasn't all bad, you know.

01:44:31.682 --> 01:44:33.891
<i>I didn't get straight on the highway.</i>

01:44:34.265 --> 01:44:37.849
<i>But slowly drove to where
our farm had once been.</i>

01:44:39.890 --> 01:44:41.933
<i>Still standing.</i>

01:44:43.182 --> 01:44:45.683
<i>That unsafe place.</i>

01:44:47.723 --> 01:44:52.599
<i>That blanked-out space where my mother
so desperately invited death.</i>

01:45:02.765 --> 01:45:04.224
<i>Maybe Ben was right.</i>

01:45:07.848 --> 01:45:09.891
<i>It wasn't all bad.</i>

01:45:19.598 --> 01:45:23.433
<i>Ben learned something in his prison
that I never learned in mine.</i>

01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:33.266
<i>Forgiveness.</i>

01:45:40.098 --> 01:45:42.290
<i>My mom told us</i>

01:45:42.390 --> 01:45:44.724
<i>to make a useful life.</i>

01:45:47.890 --> 01:45:49.641
<i>Nothing big.</i>

01:45:54.807 --> 01:45:56.641
<i>Nothing grand.</i>

01:45:58.515 --> 01:46:00.474
<i>Just a start.</i>

01:46:04.807 --> 01:46:07.849
<i>Finally, a start.</i>

01:46:08.305 --> 01:46:14.519
