Katherine, when you

you're sending out these numbers

assignments they cannot

one-time notebooks, like pads.

38:01.612 --> 38:03.446
Each page is a new cypher.

38:03.448 --> 38:04.614
When you broadcast something,

38:04.616 --> 38:06.049
the agent matches
up the first set

38:06.051 --> 38:07.684
of numbers to
the page in the notebook.

38:07.686 --> 38:09.286

01:14:42.177 --> 01:14:42.710
Is she dead?

01:14:42.712 --> 01:14:44.879
She will be if you
don't hurry the fuck up.

01:14:44.881 --> 01:14:49.150
I understand that.
I'm not a fool.

01:14:49.451 --> 01:14:52.787
<i>You understand that,</i>
<i>you're not a fool.</i>

01:15:08.303 --> 01:15:09.937
Who are you working for?

<font color="#D900D9">(BREATHING LOUDLY)</font>

01:15:16.078 --> 01:15:19.580
I used to work for the same righteous
pricks who twisted your life.

01:15:19.582 --> 01:15:26.754
Now I work for the other side. Just
as twisted but they pay a lot more.

01:15:26.889 --> 01:15:29.790
They break us, you know.

01:15:29.792 --> 01:15:33.294
Turn us into
these awful things.

01:15:33.296 --> 01:15:36.597
Broken pieces.
They push us.

01:15:36.599 --> 01:15:38.799
Make us into men we're not.

01:15:38.801 --> 01:15:42.470
And then complain
when we no longer function.

01:15:42.472 --> 01:15:45.740
They think we should
live like this is normal.

01:15:45.742 --> 01:15:50.111
Like this is how we should
behave, how we should think.

01:15:50.113 --> 01:15:52.547
And our reward for this life?

01:15:52.549 --> 01:15:54.715
We try to run away
and they kill us because

01:15:54.717 --> 01:15:56.684
of what they
forced inside our heads.

01:15:56.686 --> 01:15:59.720
You think men like
that deserve to live?

01:16:00.322 --> 01:16:04.025
They deserve everything
they got coming.

01:16:04.027 --> 01:16:05.626
Maybe.

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:09.630
Did you stop the broadcasts?

01:16:11.199 --> 01:16:12.667
Yeah.

01:16:14.736 --> 01:16:16.037
Why?

01:16:17.306 --> 01:16:21.609
Some fleeting virtue in not
being a mass murderer.

01:16:26.348 --> 01:16:28.416
I take it you're
not a religious man?

01:16:28.418 --> 01:16:31.218
You don't believe
in a guiding light?

01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:32.153
No.

01:16:32.155 --> 01:16:36.657
You're like me, then.
Floundering in wet shit.

01:16:36.659 --> 01:16:38.192
Yeah.

01:16:39.361 --> 01:16:42.597

we can go on like this?

So, you told me she was dead.

01:20:19.181 --> 01:20:20.981
Look, tell me.

01:20:22.217 --> 01:20:25.119
Burnt down,
a man's worth $4.40.

01:20:25.121 --> 01:20:27.555
Excuse me?
That's what you said.

01:20:27.557 --> 01:20:28.823
When?

01:20:28.825 --> 01:20:29.957
In the car.

01:20:29.959 --> 01:20:33.994

know, carbon and minerals.

less than five bucks.

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:40.201
I said that?
Uh-huh.

01:20:40.203 --> 01:20:43.604
Well, you know me,
I talk a lot of shit.

01:20:43.606 --> 01:20:44.905
But if you say I
said it, then I suppose

01:20:44.907 --> 01:20:47.208
I should believe you.
What about it?

01:20:47.210 --> 01:20:48.509
Hmm...

01:20:49.311 --> 01:20:51.579
We walk.
Both of us.

01:20:54.916 --> 01:21:00.287
Well, you might walk but her...
That's impossible.

01:21:00.488 --> 01:21:01.255
She knows too much.

01:21:01.257 --> 01:21:07.094
She's got the codes. She's got the cypher.
She's compromised.

01:21:08.330 --> 01:21:10.030
It's gotta stop.

01:21:10.232 --> 01:21:11.765
I'll get you
a prescription for Ativan.

01:21:11.767 --> 01:21:13.767
That will stop your
conscience bothering you.

01:21:13.769 --> 01:21:16.704
Yeah. Well, take
a look at that.

01:21:17.305 --> 01:21:20.040
It's a copy of the broadcasts.

01:21:20.342 --> 01:21:22.576
The ones she stopped.

01:21:22.578 --> 01:21:27.281
Number 14 might be
of interest. It's you.

01:21:27.415 --> 01:21:32.786
She took a bullet for you. Gotta
be worth more than five bucks.

01:21:44.766 --> 01:21:46.433
What do you want?

01:21:46.668 --> 01:21:49.169
Give me a week.
Ten days.

01:21:49.504 --> 01:21:52.706

bodies at the station?

01:21:52.941 --> 01:21:54.942
