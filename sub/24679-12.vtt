00:01.335 --> 00:03.838
In New York City's war on crime,

00:03.904 --> 00:06.145
the worst criminal offenders are pursued

00:06.206 --> 00:08.880
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

00:08.942 --> 00:10.751
These are their stories.

00:13.213 --> 00:15.591
She is not to know about this.

00:18.151 --> 00:20.529
How much do you usually get?

00:21.788 --> 00:24.632
Think of a number you're comfortable with.

00:25.726 --> 00:27.228
Now double it.

00:33.267 --> 00:35.770
Just now, up in her office.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.016
This is what she thinks of me.

00:38.071 --> 00:40.847
Oh, God. She has no boundaries.

00:42.943 --> 00:44.718
It's not gonna work.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.820
I mean us, Julie. I'm sorry.

00:51.084 --> 00:52.620
We make a good team, Kenneth.

00:52.686 --> 00:55.860
You're fooling yourself. Nan will
make our life a living hell.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.402
I'm sorry, Julie.

01:06.967 --> 01:08.378
I really am.

01:09.336 --> 01:10.610
Kenneth.

01:12.039 --> 01:13.541
(DOOR CLOSES)

01:14.775 --> 01:18.120
He loves me, Mother. Is
that so hard to believe?

01:19.346 --> 01:21.121
Your judgment is off.

01:21.181 --> 01:22.216
Right.

01:22.282 --> 01:24.694
I disagree with you, so I must be wrong.

01:25.519 --> 01:27.658
It's my life. Do you hear me?

01:27.754 --> 01:30.598
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Everyone hears you, Julie.

01:31.792 --> 01:34.363
But as long as you live under my roof,

01:34.595 --> 01:36.268
and work for me, you...

01:36.330 --> 01:38.332
You can't control me!

01:41.368 --> 01:43.575
Is this a bad time?

01:45.272 --> 01:46.910
Julie was just leaving.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.246
She only wants what's best for you.

01:51.311 --> 01:52.790
Dad, how can you take her side?

01:52.846 --> 01:54.120
I'm not.

01:55.015 --> 01:58.053
The last week, when the talk about
selling the hotel came up...

01:58.118 --> 01:59.222
What?

01:59.553 --> 02:00.759
She didn't...

02:01.788 --> 02:04.064
She said she would discuss it with you.

02:04.591 --> 02:06.298
She can't do this!

02:06.360 --> 02:08.840
You can't let her upset you like this.

02:09.229 --> 02:11.732
Come on, you've got everything going for you.

02:11.798 --> 02:14.369
You're young, you're talented,
you're gorgeous.

02:14.434 --> 02:16.311
Guys would kill for the chance to date you.

02:16.370 --> 02:17.781
You know that, don't you?

02:20.440 --> 02:22.442
KENNETH: No. No second thoughts.

02:22.509 --> 02:23.510
I just...

02:25.312 --> 02:27.292
Of course I trust you.

02:29.383 --> 02:30.623
I will.

Mr. Turner! Mr. Turner! The room below,
they call about the water, but...

02:44.364 --> 02:46.435
Slow down, Carlos. Slow down.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.673
There is a leak into the suite below yours.

02:48.735 --> 02:51.875
I called Mrs. Turner many times, no answer.

02:52.139 --> 02:53.482
I didn't want to disturb her.

02:54.107 --> 02:55.984
TURNER: Nan? Nan!

02:57.511 --> 02:59.081
Mr. Turner!

03:04.885 --> 03:06.660

The wine glass didn't even spill.

04:16.656 --> 04:18.430
Other than the corpse in the tub,

04:18.492 --> 04:21.166
the entire suite is fit for a princess.

04:21.361 --> 04:22.999
Just like the ads say.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.134
She drink and drown?

04:26.199 --> 04:28.543
The body fights drowning.

04:29.169 --> 04:32.241
The throat closes to keep the
water out. The victim suffocates.

04:34.074 --> 04:35.917
Which means she should've surfaced.

04:36.877 --> 04:38.550
Which she hasn't.

04:39.513 --> 04:42.585
Lungs are filled with water
and her throat didn't close.

04:46.019 --> 04:48.397
Forehead has blisters, pinpricks.

04:49.089 --> 04:50.534
Botox shots.

04:51.391 --> 04:52.461
Just a guess,

04:52.526 --> 04:56.201
going by that nice smooth
look in all her photos.

04:56.263 --> 04:59.472
Botox works by paralyzing

04:59.800 --> 05:03.111
the nerves around the
facial muscles, doesn't it?

05:03.170 --> 05:05.207
Does it look like I'd know?

05:06.506 --> 05:10.420
Xanax, Ambien, heart pills.
A real piñata bowl.

05:12.612 --> 05:15.286
You Major Case? I'm Cooper.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.519
That's my boss in the tub.

05:17.584 --> 05:19.495
I'm the house dick here.

05:19.553 --> 05:22.534
Used to be at the 2-4.
I'm the one who called you.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.435
On a drowning?

05:24.658 --> 05:27.468
The husband doesn't want
any insurance questions later.

05:27.527 --> 05:28.972
For example?

05:29.596 --> 05:31.303
She was suicidal?

05:32.098 --> 05:34.135
She makes other people suicidal.

05:34.201 --> 05:36.010
That include her husband?

05:36.069 --> 05:37.070
Ask him.

05:37.137 --> 05:39.947
He's in the study, about a
half a mile down that hallway.

05:42.075 --> 05:44.146
Nan did not do this to herself.

05:44.211 --> 05:46.748
She never would have given her
enemies the satisfaction.

05:46.813 --> 05:48.815
She must've slipped or...

05:48.882 --> 05:50.520
Or something.

05:50.584 --> 05:53.190
The manager said you got home around 3:00.

05:53.253 --> 05:56.462
Yes. Poker night at the Explorers.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.931
Every week for 20 years.

05:59.593 --> 06:01.504
So your wife was here by herself?

06:01.561 --> 06:02.631
Yes.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.232
What about your daughter?

06:04.297 --> 06:07.540
Julie was with her fiancé, Kenneth Rayfield.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.877
She's at his loft now. She's...

06:10.103 --> 06:12.845
She's far too upset to do any good here.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.216
Your wife have enemies?

06:15.275 --> 06:19.951
When Nan's father died,
she took over the old dame.

06:21.615 --> 06:22.958
It's been a battle.

06:24.017 --> 06:27.590
With whom? Unions? The suppliers?

06:27.654 --> 06:29.292
The competition.

06:29.422 --> 06:32.369
She was determined to keep
the hotel in the family.

06:33.059 --> 06:36.233
This belonged to Admiral Peary?

06:36.396 --> 06:38.069
He took it to the pole.

06:38.498 --> 06:40.671
Nan's father acquired it.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.874
And you use it as a, you know, letter opener?

06:45.071 --> 06:49.247
Your competitors, have they
made a play for the hotel?

06:49.309 --> 06:52.415
There is talk that the Grimwalds
are about to make an offer

06:52.479 --> 06:54.356
but you'll have to try Julie on that.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.950
Can't we try you?

06:56.616 --> 06:58.527
When the family trust was set up,

06:58.585 --> 07:03.091
the hotel passed directly
to Nan and then to Julie.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.158
I'm not part of that loop.

07:05.225 --> 07:09.298
One last thing. Did your
wife get Botox injections?

07:10.630 --> 07:14.237
A gentleman does not ask a
lady to reveal her secrets.

07:15.835 --> 07:18.441
I saw Mom just before 8:00.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.051
She was in a good mood.

07:22.876 --> 07:24.685
EAMES: And then you went to your fiancé’s?

07:24.744 --> 07:26.621
I'd just gotten back from the gym.

07:27.314 --> 07:30.295
We ordered Chinese, watched a DVD.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.153
A quiet night.

07:32.919 --> 07:35.331
- It wasn't that quiet.
- Kenneth.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.430
Your father told us that your mother

07:39.492 --> 07:42.166
was gonna keep the hotel in the family.

07:42.228 --> 07:43.707
That's right.

07:44.364 --> 07:45.775
What are your plans?

07:46.666 --> 07:48.236
I grew up in the Townson Hotel.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.871
It's my home. I'm not selling it.

07:49.936 --> 07:52.348
Maybe a competitor thought
they could change your mind.

07:52.605 --> 07:54.482
The Grimwalds, for example.

07:56.176 --> 07:57.917
If the offer was

07:59.279 --> 08:01.350
generous enough?

08:01.414 --> 08:04.520
What did the Algonquin sell
for last year, $30 million?

08:04.584 --> 08:07.963
Forty. And it's hardly in the
same league as the Townson.

08:08.588 --> 08:10.465
I'm an equity analyst at Mason Stone.

08:10.523 --> 08:11.558
Oh.

08:11.624 --> 08:14.628
JULIE: Helen Grimwald's always
had her eye on the Townson.

08:14.928 --> 08:17.374
But she underestimates me,
like everyone else.

08:18.365 --> 08:19.673
KENNETH: So Nan...

08:20.467 --> 08:23.812
It wasn't an accident,
is that what you're inferring?

08:24.204 --> 08:27.708
You mean implying. The listener infers.

08:27.774 --> 08:31.984
And detectives speculate, since we
don't know the cause of death yet.

08:32.044 --> 08:33.615
We'll be in touch.

08:36.549 --> 08:38.222
We're so sorry for your loss,

08:38.284 --> 08:40.924
especially now you're getting married.

08:41.587 --> 08:43.328
We haven't set a date yet.

08:43.390 --> 08:46.269
We just met three months ago
at a benefit and we...

08:46.326 --> 08:49.933
Wow, three months. A whirlwind romance.

08:50.797 --> 08:54.370
Well, we... We both just knew.

08:54.934 --> 08:56.675
Well, you're lucky to have each other.

09:00.106 --> 09:03.280
He knew when he got a look
at her mother's hotel.

09:04.778 --> 09:07.054
The ME's got the tox screen results.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.885
This holds 100 units of botulin.

09:11.951 --> 09:13.794
It's good for four treatments.

09:13.853 --> 09:16.891
Nan Turner had over 3,000
units in her system.

09:17.490 --> 09:18.992
Would this fill a whole syringe?

09:19.059 --> 09:20.504
Sure. It's freeze-dried.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.131
Just add saline solution and find a vein.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.603
What about these pinpricks on her forehead?

09:25.665 --> 09:29.169
Oh, those would be from a regular
treatment, probably the day she died.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.374
The lethal dose went into her jugular.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.185
Now, she had sleeping pills, wine.

09:35.241 --> 09:37.346
She was probably injected in her sleep.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.118
Yeah, the botulin caused
a descending paralysis.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.454
First she can't open her eyes,

09:41.514 --> 09:43.255
then she can't speak, can't swallow.

09:43.316 --> 09:44.852
And can't close her throat.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.761
But she can still breathe.

09:48.288 --> 09:50.928
GOREN: So the killer
dragged her to her bathtub,

09:50.990 --> 09:53.334
pushed her under and her lungs
filled with water.

09:53.393 --> 09:54.804
Death by Botox.

09:54.861 --> 09:57.171
Live slow, die old, leave
a good-looking corpse.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.369
Thanks to your friendly local dermatologist.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.241
Oh, I checked with her doctors.

10:01.301 --> 10:03.338
They never gave her Botox.

10:04.537 --> 10:06.744
Well, there's always the hotel beauty salon.

10:10.910 --> 10:12.981
I'm not licensed to dispense Botox.

10:13.046 --> 10:15.083
Yeah, we've found that a lot of people

10:15.148 --> 10:17.890
do things that they're not licensed to do.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.227
Especially if their landlord insists.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.994
My salon never treated her.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.464
Not only does he remove
hairs, but he splits them.

10:27.827 --> 10:29.568
Your cosmeticians,

10:30.763 --> 10:34.905
technically, they're independent
contractors, right?

10:35.835 --> 10:36.973
Yes.

10:37.670 --> 10:39.149
If you had to pick one?

10:42.809 --> 10:45.085
Jason. He's got a following.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.056
House calls, parties.

10:49.015 --> 10:50.961
Julie, I want you to think.

10:51.017 --> 10:53.793
Imagine the worst thing
that Kenneth could do,

10:53.853 --> 10:56.993
and then ask yourself,
would you still love him?

10:59.025 --> 11:00.561
What's done is done.

11:00.627 --> 11:03.039
What matters is, would you still love him?

11:05.298 --> 11:06.743
Would you?

11:12.472 --> 11:14.884
Then do whatever needs to be done.

11:17.710 --> 11:19.348
NINA: He's incredible.

11:19.412 --> 11:22.723
Isn't Jason the perfect
little miracle-worker?

11:22.782 --> 11:24.420
He has quite a following.

11:24.484 --> 11:26.486
Are these to-dos always so crowded?

11:26.553 --> 11:29.295
No. Half of us were here last Wednesday.

11:29.355 --> 11:33.804
(GASPING)
My dear, I would kill to have your skin.

11:34.961 --> 11:36.599
Laser abrasion, am I right?

11:36.663 --> 11:37.698
No.

11:37.764 --> 11:40.404
If you just saw Jason, why would
you need another treatment?

11:40.833 --> 11:43.211
Because Wednesday he showed up empty-handed.

11:43.269 --> 11:45.271
- Oxygen facial?
- No.

11:45.338 --> 11:46.544
So what happened?

11:46.606 --> 11:48.984
He left his whole supply in a cab.

11:49.042 --> 11:52.421
I know. You had a lymphatic drain facial.

11:52.478 --> 11:54.355
Sorry, just soap and water.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.894
Now serving number 10.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.788
I'll be done in a jiff.

12:05.124 --> 12:06.626
Aren't we eager?

12:06.693 --> 12:09.606
I couldn't take the risk you'd
run out like last Wednesday.

12:09.662 --> 12:11.335
(SIGHING)
What a nightmare!

12:11.397 --> 12:13.707
I'm surprised it didn't
make the evening news.

12:13.766 --> 12:15.370
There's still a chance.

12:18.504 --> 12:21.815
Jason here ran out of Botox
the night Nan Turner died.

12:21.874 --> 12:23.182
What is going on here?

12:23.243 --> 12:25.189
A murder investigation.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.825
The Baronet, isn't that a Grimwald hotel?

12:29.882 --> 12:31.190
Yeah, what isn't?

12:31.251 --> 12:33.162
I gave a party in one of their suites.

12:34.053 --> 12:36.363
The Vam Dam, another Grimwald hotel.

12:36.422 --> 12:39.426
Boy, you are just in too cozy

12:39.492 --> 12:42.302
with the Grimwalds for your own good.

12:48.534 --> 12:51.014
He left those vials in a cab.

12:51.070 --> 12:52.777
How often do you need to hear it?

12:53.840 --> 12:56.616
Helen Grimwald was your regular customer.

12:58.244 --> 13:01.782
I mean, you saw her the Monday
before you saw Nan Turner.

13:03.816 --> 13:07.127
GOREN: (STAMMERING) Come on.
It's written right there in ink.

13:07.587 --> 13:09.294
Did she know that Nan was your client?

13:09.355 --> 13:10.493
He's not gonna answer that.

13:10.556 --> 13:12.536
He's gonna want to say something.

13:12.592 --> 13:16.267
He's already on the hook for nine counts
of dispensing a controlled substance.

13:16.329 --> 13:19.208
It's just Botox, for God's sake.

13:19.432 --> 13:20.843
Just Botox?

13:22.568 --> 13:23.945
You mean anyone could do it?

13:25.538 --> 13:26.778
Even me?

13:27.940 --> 13:29.317
This stuff was derived

13:29.375 --> 13:32.117
from something developed
for germ warfare in the '50s.

13:32.178 --> 13:34.886
A jury might not think it's so harmless.

13:35.181 --> 13:37.422
Especially when they find out Nan died

13:37.483 --> 13:40.589
after having 30 vials of it
jammed into her neck.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.098
I, look... I...

13:42.722 --> 13:46.033
I lugged those vials around all day in this.

13:46.292 --> 13:50.172
First in the fridge at the
Townson's beauty salon.

13:50.229 --> 13:53.574
Then I had some sessions at the
Baronet. I stored them in their spa.

13:53.633 --> 13:57.513
After that, the Plaza.
Well, you get the idea.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.943
The idea being that the vials
could've been stolen

14:01.007 --> 14:04.045
at any point.

14:04.410 --> 14:07.220
Yes. Not that I'm pointing fingers,

14:07.280 --> 14:11.820
but Helen Grimwald knew that
Nan was a client of mine.

14:12.285 --> 14:14.265
She was always asking me
about Nan's health.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.560
It was morbid.

14:15.621 --> 14:18.659
She thought as soon as Nan kicked,
she could grab up the hotel?

14:18.725 --> 14:21.171
Yeah, I tried to tell her
Julie Turner would never sell.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.396
Julie lived to renovate.

14:23.696 --> 14:28.645
But Helen said that she had a little
bird who told her to be patient.

14:29.502 --> 14:30.845
A little bird.

14:31.337 --> 14:32.475
JASON: Yes.

14:32.939 --> 14:37.786
Apparently the same one who saved her a
lot of money when she bought the Baronet.

14:39.679 --> 14:40.851
Okay, thank you.

14:42.014 --> 14:44.722
3 years ago, when the Grimwalds
bought the Baronet,

14:44.784 --> 14:46.855
they got a bridge loan
through Mason Stone.

14:47.186 --> 14:49.166
Kenneth Rayfield's firm.

14:49.655 --> 14:52.397
Yeah, that's Helen Grimwald's little bird.

14:52.458 --> 14:54.597
Once the old lady's out of the way,

14:55.161 --> 14:57.300
he'd sweet-talk the daughter
into selling the hotel.

14:57.363 --> 15:00.674
And he gets a commission from the
Grimwalds and a $40 million dowry.

15:00.733 --> 15:05.648
Except that he killed Nan
before marrying the daughter

15:05.705 --> 15:08.185
and locking in the profits.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.352
Nan was in bad health.

15:10.843 --> 15:12.880
He could've let nature take its course.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.190
Something forced his hand.

15:17.350 --> 15:18.624
Kenneth?

15:20.186 --> 15:21.392
Julie adores him.

15:22.488 --> 15:24.399
You trust her judgment?

15:25.158 --> 15:27.604
Three months, they're already engaged?

15:28.494 --> 15:30.496
Julie's had some bad luck in the past.

15:31.497 --> 15:32.737
She's been divorced?

15:32.799 --> 15:35.609
No, she was engaged about three years ago.

15:36.335 --> 15:38.372
Came to her senses just in time.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.714
Was this guy also in the real estate field?

15:40.773 --> 15:43.947
Junker? He played the field,
he didn't have one.

15:44.243 --> 15:45.586
How'd you find out?

15:45.645 --> 15:49.252
We found out because Nan
did her due diligence.

15:49.749 --> 15:51.160
You didn't tell Julie?

15:53.019 --> 15:54.930
With Julie, if you push one way,

15:54.987 --> 15:56.660
she tends to go the other way.

15:56.722 --> 15:59.202
We felt it better to let her...

15:59.258 --> 16:01.670
Come to her senses? You know...

16:02.862 --> 16:06.105
There's a check stub missing.
it's been ripped out.

16:06.165 --> 16:08.805
And the checks before and after were written

16:08.868 --> 16:10.575
the day of your wife's murder.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.206
It's check 768.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.081
Do you know anything about it?

16:15.608 --> 16:18.612
The trust account was strictly Nan's domain.

16:23.449 --> 16:24.484
PRESCOTT: It's been over a week.

16:24.550 --> 16:26.723
That check should have cleared by now.

16:26.786 --> 16:30.791
The day the check was written, were there
any other transfers into the account?

16:32.124 --> 16:34.866
Mrs. Turner transferred $100,000.

16:36.462 --> 16:38.066
Did I say something amusing?

16:38.130 --> 16:40.508
Not yet. Could you look up a check?

16:40.566 --> 16:42.011
A three-year-old check?

16:42.335 --> 16:44.110
The name of the payee?

16:44.504 --> 16:46.950
Well, we only have the first name.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.714
Junker, with a J.

16:49.775 --> 16:52.688
Just be happy his name isn't Messerschmitt.

16:58.551 --> 16:59.757
There.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.156
Junker Dalton.

17:05.391 --> 17:08.166
$30,000 for traveling expenses.

17:08.227 --> 17:09.968
As in, "Hit the road, Junker."

17:10.029 --> 17:11.030
Nan's MO.

17:11.097 --> 17:14.203
She pays Julie's fiancée to go away.

17:14.267 --> 17:15.769
Ken didn't go.

17:16.602 --> 17:18.012
Why take the consolation prize

17:18.069 --> 17:20.743
when you can stay in the game
and marry $40 million?

17:21.807 --> 17:25.914
So Kenneth killed Nan
and Julie's covering for him.

17:28.714 --> 17:31.024
My father told me all about your suspicions.

17:31.083 --> 17:32.084
You're desperate.

17:32.151 --> 17:33.892
You don't care whose life you destroy.

17:33.953 --> 17:35.899
We care who destroyed your mother's.

17:36.789 --> 17:40.601
When Ken came over that day she
died, it was around lunchtime?

17:40.660 --> 17:42.640
People saw him in the lobby.

17:43.329 --> 17:45.536
Yes, he was here to have lunch with me.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.635
Oh, good, because the people who saw him

17:47.700 --> 17:49.338
weren't sure what day it was.

17:49.402 --> 17:52.008
Oh, is that how it's going to be?
We're going to play tricks?

17:52.071 --> 17:54.642
Well, like you said, we're desperate.

17:54.707 --> 17:57.586
Anyway, so the two of you met in
the loft. That was around 8:00?

17:58.511 --> 18:01.287
- He just came back from the gym,
he took a shower?
- JULIE: Yes.

18:01.347 --> 18:02.417
- Yes?
- No.

18:02.481 --> 18:03.824
- No? What?
- He showered at the gym.

18:03.883 --> 18:05.453
EAMES: Take your time.

18:05.551 --> 18:08.054
And then you ordered in
Chinese from Maple Duck?

18:08.120 --> 18:09.565
Yes. Did we tell you?

18:09.622 --> 18:11.932
We got it off his credit card bill.

18:11.991 --> 18:14.471
You see, we did a little snooping.

18:16.062 --> 18:17.803
The restaurant told us this...

18:17.863 --> 18:19.137
(SNICKERING)
Look at this...

18:19.465 --> 18:22.810
That the order was made just after 10:00.

18:23.235 --> 18:27.980
Well, as Ken alluded crudely,
we were preoccupied.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.576
GOREN: Oh, yeah, well...
Oh, that's right.

18:29.642 --> 18:32.555
You took a tumble between 8:00 and 10:00.

18:32.612 --> 18:35.957
The restaurant also told us the
order was picked up in person.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.455
Well, they're confused.

18:38.517 --> 18:40.121
Ken was with me the whole evening.

18:40.186 --> 18:41.358
Then we're confused,

18:41.420 --> 18:44.924
because his gym said he scanned
himself in just after 9:00.

18:44.991 --> 18:47.403
Oh, someone must have stolen
his membership card.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.838
Next you're gonna tell me
someone stole his cell phone

18:49.895 --> 18:51.568
and called you at quarter to ten.

18:52.865 --> 18:54.845
No, I used his cell phone.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.107
I misplaced mine in his loft, so I called it,

18:57.169 --> 18:58.739
so it would ring, so I could find it.

18:58.804 --> 19:01.944
You're turning every little innocent
thing into evidence of nothing.

19:02.008 --> 19:03.749
While you waited for Ken at his loft,

19:03.809 --> 19:07.552
Ken killed your mother and then ran
around establishing his alibi.

19:07.613 --> 19:10.787
'Cause he was afraid that
you wouldn't lie for him.

19:10.883 --> 19:14.228
JULIE: I'm not lying. Ken
wouldn't hurt my mother.

19:17.023 --> 19:19.060
You're into homeopathy.

19:19.425 --> 19:23.202
There's Lycopodium, Iris, Satrum.

19:23.429 --> 19:24.499
Leave my things alone.

19:24.563 --> 19:26.406
Well, they're expired, anyway.
You don't use them?

19:26.465 --> 19:28.411
No. Just put them down.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.573
You know, your mother was right.

19:31.637 --> 19:33.412
You have no judgment when it comes to men.

19:33.472 --> 19:35.679
- How would you know what my mother...
- Your last fiancé...

19:35.741 --> 19:38.984
- What was his name?
- Junker. She paid him $30 grand to get lost.

19:39.045 --> 19:41.355
How would you know about... That was a loan.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.792
- She knew...
- A con when she saw one.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.261
Is that why she wrote
Ken a check for $100,000?

19:46.318 --> 19:48.992
Ken ripped up that check.
Doesn't that tell you something?

19:49.055 --> 19:51.467
Well, what's one check when
you can marry the checkbook?

19:51.524 --> 19:53.094
How dare you!

19:53.592 --> 19:56.198
Ken loves me! Is that so hard to believe?

19:57.096 --> 19:59.599
He understands me! He loves me!

20:03.869 --> 20:05.314
We're sorry.

20:07.573 --> 20:09.575
We'll show ourselves out.

20:12.912 --> 20:15.950
She's not covering for him.
He's covering for her.

20:20.386 --> 20:21.524
JASON: I never gave her treatments.

20:21.587 --> 20:22.895
Julie's an attractive young woman.

20:22.955 --> 20:24.593
She doesn't need Botox.

20:26.325 --> 20:29.101
I saw Julie's homeopathic stash.

20:30.329 --> 20:33.037
All the treatments for migraines.

20:34.133 --> 20:36.306
And the heavy curtains in her suite,

20:36.669 --> 20:39.149
to block out the light.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.044
She suffered from migraines.

20:42.575 --> 20:43.815
I wouldn't know.

20:44.477 --> 20:45.888
EAMES: We checked with the hotel pharmacy.

20:45.945 --> 20:50.155
It's been four months since she
refilled her migraine prescriptions.

20:53.085 --> 20:56.191
She found something better, didn't she?

20:56.756 --> 20:57.962
She found Botox.

20:58.524 --> 21:01.095
EAMES: We heard for some
people, it works miracles.

21:01.761 --> 21:06.540
That day that Nan died, Julie came to you.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.877
She said she had a bad one

21:08.934 --> 21:11.278
and you just wanted to help her.

21:14.440 --> 21:17.887
She said they hurt so bad that they
make people want to kill themselves.

21:19.478 --> 21:21.788
GOREN: She asked to buy your whole supply?

21:22.581 --> 21:24.891
EAMES: She threatened to make trouble for you?

21:25.384 --> 21:27.261
I just wanted to help her.

21:27.586 --> 21:31.056
And then later, I realized...

21:32.792 --> 21:34.738
You helped her commit murder.

21:41.500 --> 21:42.740
GOREN: The happy couple.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.406
We brought you new engagement rings.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.882
Julie Turner, you're under arrest for murder.

21:46.939 --> 21:48.612
You're gonna have to come with us, too.

21:48.674 --> 21:50.654
Ken, don't leave me.

21:50.709 --> 21:52.711
It's nice being loved so much.

21:55.414 --> 21:56.552
Ken!

22:00.986 --> 22:03.990
I just told Helen Grimwald Nan had concerns

22:04.056 --> 22:05.831
about Julie's ability to run the hotel.

22:05.891 --> 22:07.802
Nan might've been enticed to sell it

22:07.860 --> 22:10.932
before Julie could run it into the ground?

22:10.996 --> 22:12.134
Yes.

22:12.698 --> 22:14.871
Did Julie know what her mother was thinking?

22:15.868 --> 22:17.108
I don't know.

22:17.603 --> 22:19.207
We talked about other things.

22:20.306 --> 22:22.650
Like about the $100,000 check?

22:23.943 --> 22:25.547
Julie told us about that.

22:26.445 --> 22:29.449
Not one of my finest moments. I acted rashly.

22:31.150 --> 22:34.393
Ripping up the check was a noble gesture.

22:34.453 --> 22:36.899
I mean, giving Julie back
the engagement ring.

22:36.956 --> 22:39.937
But Nan would've made our life a living hell.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.764
Julie didn't tell you?

22:44.196 --> 22:45.971
EAMES: Let's see if we have this straight.

22:46.031 --> 22:48.568
Her mother was planning to sell
the hotel out from under her

22:48.634 --> 22:51.080
and she drove her fiancé away.

22:52.171 --> 22:53.946
Did we miss anything?

22:54.006 --> 22:55.747
I know what you're implying.

22:55.808 --> 22:58.414
But Julie is just not capable
of hurting her mother.

23:01.513 --> 23:03.993
So, again,

23:05.951 --> 23:08.955
what time did Julie show up at your loft?

23:09.488 --> 23:13.334
And this is an answer that you
wanna give a lot of thought to.

23:16.662 --> 23:19.643
I... I called her just after I left the gym.

23:20.199 --> 23:22.076
She was out walking.

23:22.134 --> 23:25.047
I told her to meet me at my place.

23:25.104 --> 23:26.344
She...

23:28.107 --> 23:30.348
She got there just after 10:00.

23:30.576 --> 23:33.420
Sounds like the right answer.
Whose idea was it to lie?

23:34.280 --> 23:36.419
Julie was afraid she'd be accused.

23:36.482 --> 23:38.826
I... Now, I told her that was ridiculous.

23:38.884 --> 23:41.330
But she was so upset. She...

23:43.489 --> 23:46.732
I said, "We should just say
that we were together."

23:47.626 --> 23:49.367
I knew she'd never have hurt Nan.

23:50.562 --> 23:53.236
I bought enough for one headache, okay?

23:53.933 --> 23:58.643
I was under a lot of stress with the
wedding preparations and the redecorating.

23:58.704 --> 24:01.014
Redecorating your mother allowed you to do

24:01.073 --> 24:04.111
while she was making provisions
to sell the hotel?

24:04.176 --> 24:05.211
Just a rumor.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.985
- My mother had complete faith in me.
- Your mother...

24:13.519 --> 24:14.623
I…

24:17.222 --> 24:19.133
No. No, it's too easy.

24:20.159 --> 24:22.002
Why? What's too easy?

24:22.628 --> 24:24.938
To get you to go on about your mother.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.411
You should wait for your lawyer.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.538
I don't need a lawyer to tell the truth.

24:30.602 --> 24:34.482
No, you need a lawyer
because it's hard for you

24:36.008 --> 24:37.919
to know what the truth is.

24:38.844 --> 24:40.152
It's not your fault.

24:40.212 --> 24:41.953
I mean, how could you,
with a mother like Nan?

24:42.014 --> 24:44.290
Don't patronize me. I've had enough of that.

24:44.350 --> 24:45.522
Hey, I'm trying to let you know

24:45.584 --> 24:48.064
that there's a lot of sympathy
for you in this room.

24:50.022 --> 24:52.764
You had a parent that lied to you.

24:54.193 --> 24:55.399
Undermined you.

24:55.961 --> 24:58.441
Questioned your judgment to the point where

24:59.732 --> 25:02.008
you didn't even trust it yourself.

25:02.201 --> 25:04.147
She didn't want you to be happy.

25:05.871 --> 25:07.942
I did not hate my mother.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.449
I did not kill her.

25:10.776 --> 25:12.119
I was with Kenneth.

25:12.177 --> 25:13.679
That's not true.

25:14.079 --> 25:15.524
Ken told us.

25:17.816 --> 25:21.992
Julie, we can see that you're
not a cold-blooded killer.

25:22.621 --> 25:24.123
You were provoked.

25:26.258 --> 25:27.931
I didn't kill her.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.601
And she drove Kenneth away.

25:31.263 --> 25:34.210
Kenneth told us that he
broke off the engagement.

25:34.266 --> 25:36.041
That was just a test.

25:36.101 --> 25:38.581
She wanted to see if he'd take the money.

25:39.004 --> 25:42.850
A test? Like the $30,000 she loaned Junker?

25:43.375 --> 25:45.981
No, she was right about him.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.956
That he took the money?

25:48.380 --> 25:51.054
That and he was cheating on me.

25:51.583 --> 25:53.062
According to Nan.

25:53.118 --> 25:55.394
She showed me pictures, okay?

25:56.755 --> 25:58.996
So if she had anything on Kenneth,

25:59.058 --> 26:01.060
she would've shown it to me.

26:01.493 --> 26:04.406
So it was just a test. And he passed.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.475
Then she realized I was right.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.602
She realized he loves me.

26:11.136 --> 26:13.446
This is Mr. Edwards, her family lawyer.

26:13.505 --> 26:15.075
Your father's just outside, Julie.

26:15.140 --> 26:16.813
He doesn't want you to say another word.

26:16.875 --> 26:18.821
Until we get a criminal attorney,

26:18.877 --> 26:21.517
she's reasserting her right to remain silent.

26:23.082 --> 26:24.891
What do you mean, we can't post bail?

26:24.950 --> 26:26.725
Most of the money is in the family trust.

26:26.785 --> 26:28.526
Normally, Julie would have access to it,

26:28.587 --> 26:30.999
but since she's charged with killing Nan...

26:31.056 --> 26:34.060
There's gotta be something
I can use for collateral?

26:34.126 --> 26:36.538
There's not enough that's yours to pledge.

26:37.663 --> 26:39.199
There's gotta be something we can do.

26:39.264 --> 26:41.642
Well, if she were to assign you

26:41.700 --> 26:45.113
power of attorney over the
trust, temporarily...

26:46.038 --> 26:47.244
Well...

26:47.873 --> 26:50.479
(STAMMERING)
I don't want it to appear as though

26:50.542 --> 26:52.215
I'm losing faith in her.

26:52.277 --> 26:54.814
Perhaps you can bring it up with
her, from a legal standpoint.

26:54.880 --> 26:56.257
Well, that's your call, William.

26:56.315 --> 26:57.419
Yes.

26:57.483 --> 26:59.588
Now, as far as a defense attorney,

26:59.651 --> 27:01.289
I want the best you can get.

27:03.021 --> 27:05.900
She can't tell us what it is
or what it isn't,

27:05.958 --> 27:07.869
what she should tell us, what she shouldn't.

27:07.926 --> 27:09.405
She's a pathological liar.

27:09.461 --> 27:11.338
Whatever story works,
that's the one she goes with.

27:11.396 --> 27:12.898
Whatever works for her.

27:12.965 --> 27:15.036
She's not lying to us,
she's lying to herself.

27:15.100 --> 27:16.977
Are you hoping the truth is in these boxes?

27:17.035 --> 27:19.515
We're looking for the evidence
Nan had against Kenneth.

27:19.571 --> 27:22.745
What makes you think she had anything
more than a mother's instinct?

27:23.175 --> 27:25.883
Well, her husband said
she did her due diligence.

27:25.944 --> 27:29.221
Last time, that meant
photos of Julie's fiancé.

27:29.481 --> 27:32.894
The evidence against Julie lays
out in a nice, straight line.

27:32.951 --> 27:35.557
Juries like straight lines.

27:39.124 --> 27:41.001
Whatever Nan had, it's not here.

27:41.059 --> 27:43.938
And there's no evidence
she hired an investigator now,

27:43.996 --> 27:46.909
or three years ago to take photos of Junker.

27:46.965 --> 27:49.309
Well, maybe she kept it in-house.

27:50.335 --> 27:53.009
So, what's your thinking on this murder?

27:53.071 --> 27:55.312
They're trying to find out
who Mrs. Turner hired

27:55.374 --> 27:58.821
to take the snapshots of that...

27:58.877 --> 28:01.016
What's his name? Junker.

28:01.079 --> 28:02.820
And the Captain thinks it was you.

28:02.881 --> 28:05.452
Well, you want a job done right, hire a pro.

28:05.784 --> 28:07.855
What can I tell you? Legwork 101.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.797
(MEN LAUGHING)

28:09.855 --> 28:12.836
So when it was Kenneth's turn,
she came to you?

28:12.891 --> 28:14.268
You would've thought.

28:14.326 --> 28:16.829
I even offered but Mrs. Turner said no.

28:17.396 --> 28:19.069
Why do you think?

28:21.600 --> 28:24.342
Mrs. Turner didn't want another incident.

28:24.403 --> 28:26.314
You mean, with Julie?

28:28.307 --> 28:30.082
She was violent?

28:30.709 --> 28:32.211
COOPER: Yeah.

28:33.111 --> 28:35.591
She attacked her mother?

28:36.281 --> 28:37.954
Well, they had this huge argument

28:38.016 --> 28:40.462
when Mrs. Turner showed her the pictures.

28:40.519 --> 28:41.589
I thought it was over.

28:41.653 --> 28:45.567
But that night, they're on their
way out to go to some dinner,

28:45.624 --> 28:48.036
and Julie hauled off and punched her.

28:48.260 --> 28:49.762
Nearly broke her jaw.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.132
So this time,

28:52.197 --> 28:55.804
Mrs. Turner wanted to be more
supportive of her daughter.

28:55.867 --> 28:59.576
She even took her to Florida the weekend
before she died. Just the two of them.

28:59.638 --> 29:01.640
Come back happy as pismo clams.

29:01.707 --> 29:02.777
(COOPER CHUCKLES)

29:02.841 --> 29:05.253
I don't think Julie did it.

29:05.510 --> 29:08.184
We'll pass that on to the DA.
Thanks for coming in.

29:14.853 --> 29:16.764
Yeah, one last thing.

29:17.656 --> 29:20.660
This punch-out over the photos,

29:20.726 --> 29:22.330
did Kenneth know about it?

29:22.394 --> 29:24.203
Yeah, he asked me about it once.

29:24.596 --> 29:26.098
He found it amusing.

29:28.934 --> 29:31.244
Well, you know where to find me.

29:31.670 --> 29:35.311
Kenneth told us he didn't think Julie
was capable of hurting her mother.

29:35.374 --> 29:37.513
Gee, you think he was lying?

29:38.043 --> 29:40.250
He knew she could be provoked.

29:40.612 --> 29:43.252
With rumors of Nan selling the hotel,

29:44.116 --> 29:47.256
with Nan paying off another fiancé,

29:49.354 --> 29:52.392
he got her to do his dirty work for him.

29:52.457 --> 29:54.801
If she gets caught, his hands are clean.

29:55.727 --> 29:57.798
So much for nice straight lines.

30:01.033 --> 30:03.138
I gladly posted bail today.

30:03.201 --> 30:06.842
Anyone who knows my daughter, knows she could
not possibly have committed this crime.

30:06.905 --> 30:08.942
REPORTER: Julie! Julie, did you do it?

30:09.007 --> 30:11.954
She has no comment, gentlemen.
No comment, please.

30:12.010 --> 30:15.253
I just wanna say how much I miss
my mom. I loved her very much.

30:15.881 --> 30:17.724
WOMAN: Do you have any other comments?

30:17.783 --> 30:19.262
It may amuse you to know

30:19.318 --> 30:22.629
her lawyer's already putting out
feelers for a plea bargain.

30:22.688 --> 30:24.634
I'm inclined to accept.

30:26.792 --> 30:28.465
Even if someone put her up to it?

30:28.760 --> 30:31.001
That doesn't lessen her culpability.

30:31.630 --> 30:33.439
Who is this someone?

30:33.498 --> 30:34.943
Her fiancé.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.705
He created a circumstance

30:38.036 --> 30:41.279
which he knew in the past had
caused her to attack her mother.

30:41.340 --> 30:45.015
If her fiancé were trying to control
her, wouldn't she lash out at him?

30:45.077 --> 30:47.785
Not if he made her believe
Nan was pulling the strings.

30:49.114 --> 30:51.060
If you take Julie's plea,

30:51.116 --> 30:54.859
if you put the weight of this
murder on her shoulders alone,

30:55.787 --> 30:58.768
we lose our leverage
against any other suspect.

30:58.824 --> 31:01.031
I'll hold off responding to their plea offer.

31:01.860 --> 31:04.568
But sooner or later, I will
take the bird in hand.

31:09.034 --> 31:11.344
Kenneth, he knew

31:12.204 --> 31:14.275
that if he could trick Nan

31:14.539 --> 31:17.679
into paying him off,

31:17.943 --> 31:19.013
Julie would snap.

31:19.077 --> 31:21.023
And the way to trick Nan

31:21.079 --> 31:25.858
was to let her find out about
his, you know, bad behavior.

31:27.719 --> 31:29.858
Nan and Julie spent the weekend in Florida.

31:29.921 --> 31:32.128
She wrote the check when she came back.

31:33.959 --> 31:35.302
Kenneth was in the city alone.

31:35.360 --> 31:37.237
Whatever he did to set Nan off,

31:38.063 --> 31:40.407
good chance he did it that weekend.

31:41.666 --> 31:44.078
At this point, I don't think
we should count on Kenneth.

31:44.136 --> 31:46.116
But who else can testify for me?

31:46.171 --> 31:48.412
Well, that's why I approached Mr. Carver.

31:49.040 --> 31:51.350
About a plea bargain? Absolutely not.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.151
Will, consider manslaughter.

31:53.211 --> 31:54.690
If Julie said she had help from...

31:54.746 --> 31:55.850
Well, from Kenneth, for example.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.086
I would never hurt Kenneth, ever.

31:57.149 --> 31:59.857
My daughter doesn't have
to perjure herself to win.

32:00.285 --> 32:02.094
If you're afraid to try this case,

32:02.154 --> 32:03.997
we'll find someone who isn't.

32:06.291 --> 32:08.931
Friday night he had sushi for one.

32:09.795 --> 32:13.004
Phone calls to Julie in South
Beach every couple of hours.

32:13.064 --> 32:14.668
So lovey-dovey.

32:16.201 --> 32:18.977
Do you have a charge there for Cafe Brasilia?

32:23.875 --> 32:25.946
MARISOL: 1:00, table for two.

32:26.011 --> 32:28.048
Did you see who was number two?

32:28.113 --> 32:29.649
No.

32:30.048 --> 32:33.120
This is Kenny? He's so handsome.

32:34.586 --> 32:38.033
Everybody's having a, you know, a good time.

32:39.024 --> 32:41.061
This is a good time place.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.705
I like these photos. Who took them?

32:45.063 --> 32:46.371
Mercedes.

32:46.832 --> 32:49.608
(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)

32:51.403 --> 32:53.849
You remember this guy 3 Saturdays ago?

32:53.905 --> 32:56.215
(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)

32:57.843 --> 32:59.254
Oh, yes.

32:59.311 --> 33:02.417
This guy asked me to take a picture
of him and his date, like a surprise.

33:02.481 --> 33:03.721
So, I do.

33:03.782 --> 33:05.921
What did his date look like?

33:05.984 --> 33:08.225
They were kissing. I see
only the back of his head.

33:08.286 --> 33:09.924
He was wearing a baseball hat.

33:10.822 --> 33:13.962
- His head? The date was a man?
- Yes.

33:14.192 --> 33:15.671
Did he buy the photo?

33:15.727 --> 33:18.367
This guy buy it right away. Okay?

33:20.966 --> 33:23.173
Kenneth outed himself.

33:23.235 --> 33:25.715
He sent the photo to Nan anonymously.

33:25.770 --> 33:28.341
He knew that it would
get her to pay him off.

33:28.406 --> 33:29.714
Why didn't Nan just tell Julie?

33:29.774 --> 33:31.879
She had proof, in living color.

33:32.277 --> 33:35.451
No. If she did, Julie
would've dumped him herself.

33:35.914 --> 33:38.087
Kenneth's plan wouldn't have worked.

33:39.384 --> 33:43.093
He had to make Nan appear unreasonable.

33:43.154 --> 33:44.724
He had to make absolutely sure

33:44.789 --> 33:46.928
that Nan would never show Julie the photo.

33:51.897 --> 33:55.106
Julie goes to jail, who's left standing?

33:56.468 --> 33:57.606
No.

33:58.136 --> 34:00.116
It explains everything.

34:00.171 --> 34:02.048
JULIE: We're both innocent, okay?

34:02.474 --> 34:05.182
I told Mr. Behrens I'm not
interested in a plea bargain.

34:05.243 --> 34:06.722
Neither are we, but we're compelled

34:06.778 --> 34:08.757
to explore mitigating circumstances.

34:09.981 --> 34:11.551
I'm not some puppet.

34:11.616 --> 34:14.563
No one can manipulate me
into A: Something I didn't do,

34:14.619 --> 34:16.393
and B: Something I would never do.

34:16.454 --> 34:17.899
C: and D:

34:17.956 --> 34:21.402
You attacked your mother three
years ago, and Kenneth knew it.

34:21.458 --> 34:22.802
That's...

34:23.895 --> 34:25.601
I was a different person then.

34:25.664 --> 34:27.074
Anyway, Kenneth didn't know.

34:27.132 --> 34:28.406
GOREN: He knew.

34:29.266 --> 34:31.110
He talked to your house detective.

34:31.870 --> 34:33.507
This is Mr. Cooper's statement.

34:36.708 --> 34:39.848
While you and your mother were in Florida,

34:41.279 --> 34:43.384
Kenneth went to a nightclub.

34:43.848 --> 34:48.763
This is a photo of his
reservation. You see his name here?

34:49.955 --> 34:51.127
Kenny.

34:52.357 --> 34:54.098
While he was there,

34:55.327 --> 34:57.273
he had a photo taken of himself.

34:58.496 --> 35:03.002
A compromising photo which
he sent to Nan anonymously.

35:03.268 --> 35:06.181
This is the statement from
the hostess at the club.

35:07.505 --> 35:10.384
And this is the statement of the girl

35:10.442 --> 35:11.944
who took the photo.

35:13.011 --> 35:15.753
Please. Kenneth kissing another man?

35:16.281 --> 35:18.386
Believe me, if my mother had that photo,

35:18.450 --> 35:19.656
she would've shown it to me.

35:19.718 --> 35:21.026
Even if it meant hurting you?

35:21.086 --> 35:22.463
I've gotten over worse.

35:24.255 --> 35:26.360
Kenneth didn't want you to get over this.

35:27.292 --> 35:30.364
And there's a reason why your
mother didn't show you the photo.

35:32.530 --> 35:34.908
Because she did love you.

35:35.867 --> 35:38.370
She was afraid it would destroy you.

35:40.972 --> 35:44.545
We found out Kenneth served
on a tourism board last year.

35:44.609 --> 35:45.781
Did you know that?

35:45.844 --> 35:46.914
No.

35:47.946 --> 35:50.187
Your father was on the same board.

35:50.248 --> 35:52.285
Did he mention meeting Ken?

35:52.550 --> 35:56.054
No. He was only on it for a few months.

35:56.121 --> 35:58.067
What does this have to do with anything?

35:58.123 --> 36:01.866
That benefit where you met Kenneth,
how did you happen to go?

36:03.228 --> 36:04.935
My father bought me a ticket.

36:04.996 --> 36:07.442
He thought I should get
involved in good works.

36:10.735 --> 36:14.080
Your father has your best interest
at heart? He gives you good advice?

36:14.139 --> 36:15.209
Yes, he does.

36:15.273 --> 36:17.253
He's always there for you.

36:17.308 --> 36:20.050
He was standing next to you
on the courthouse steps.

36:20.111 --> 36:21.146
Yes.

36:21.212 --> 36:25.854
He probably asked you not
to take the plea bargain.

36:26.184 --> 36:29.028
That a trial would vindicate you?

36:29.754 --> 36:31.995
Yes, he did. He believes in me.

36:32.057 --> 36:33.695
What are you getting at?

36:33.758 --> 36:37.001
We noticed, from the trust accounts,

36:37.562 --> 36:40.702
your mother paid your father
a monthly allowance.

36:41.132 --> 36:42.839
I don't know. That was between them.

36:42.901 --> 36:45.472
Who signs those allowance checks now?

36:46.538 --> 36:48.779
Well, because of this nonsense...

36:50.041 --> 36:53.614
You signed power of attorney
over to your father?

36:58.883 --> 37:01.727
If you go to prison,
what'll happen to the hotel?

37:01.786 --> 37:04.323
- I'm not going to prison.
- If you do,

37:04.989 --> 37:07.697
who will control the hotel? Your father?

37:10.161 --> 37:11.265
Yes.

37:11.329 --> 37:13.969
Because he has power of
attorney, he could sell it.

37:14.032 --> 37:15.841
- He wouldn't.
- But he could

37:15.900 --> 37:18.506
and there would be no one to stop him.

37:19.771 --> 37:22.945
No. No, my father did not do this to me.

37:23.007 --> 37:26.352
Don't get upset and just sit and listen.

37:29.013 --> 37:31.857
Your father knew your temper.

37:32.884 --> 37:34.989
He knew what buttons to push.

37:35.487 --> 37:37.967
He used Ken to provoke you.

37:38.957 --> 37:40.834
I'm not listening to any more of this!

37:40.892 --> 37:43.896
- BEHRENS: Julie.
- Let her go. Go ahead, Julie, run.

37:43.962 --> 37:45.100
Just run.

37:45.163 --> 37:46.506
(CRYING)

37:47.332 --> 37:49.778
You push her one way, she goes the other.

37:52.203 --> 37:54.843
Those are the exact words
your father said to us.

37:58.843 --> 38:01.687
Imagine the insight that he gave Kenneth.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.821
No wonder Ken understood you.

38:07.485 --> 38:09.431
Oh, this can't be true.

38:10.889 --> 38:12.459
My father loves me.

38:12.524 --> 38:14.435
GOREN: Your mother loved you.

38:16.027 --> 38:17.938
She didn't show you the photo,

38:17.996 --> 38:19.907
she couldn't show you the photo,

38:19.964 --> 38:21.966
because the other man kissing Ken

38:22.033 --> 38:24.138
wasn't just any other man.

38:25.770 --> 38:30.048
No. No, my... My father's not gay.

38:31.743 --> 38:33.313
This is a monstrous lie.

38:34.979 --> 38:37.858
Julie, come on, you've known it all along.

38:38.616 --> 38:40.095
Even as a kid,

38:40.151 --> 38:42.563
this image that your parents
presented to you,

38:43.254 --> 38:45.029
of a happy marriage,

38:45.990 --> 38:48.436
and what you saw with your eyes

38:48.493 --> 38:50.700
was out of sync with what you felt.

38:52.397 --> 38:56.709
Oh, God. What's happening?
What's happening to me?

38:56.768 --> 39:00.113
Look, in my own life,

39:01.272 --> 39:04.151
I know what it's like to have your
judgment, your sense of security,

39:04.209 --> 39:06.348
undermined by your parents.

39:07.979 --> 39:10.357
Because they were hiding a truth

39:11.716 --> 39:13.992
or denying it to themselves.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.196
You can survive that.

39:28.233 --> 39:31.339
My client's ready to admit her
guilt in her mother's murder,

39:31.402 --> 39:35.043
but obviously, her father's involvement
has changed her situation.

39:35.106 --> 39:37.347
As I said, we're willing
to consider mitigation.

39:37.408 --> 39:40.321
But we still have to make
a case against Mr. Turner.

39:40.378 --> 39:41.857
Do you have a plan?

39:41.913 --> 39:43.256
We've discussed one.

39:43.314 --> 39:46.557
We found a clause in your
mother's trust agreement.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.426
You need my help?

39:51.089 --> 39:53.399
Well, only if you're up to it.

40:02.033 --> 40:03.239
Julie!

40:03.301 --> 40:06.874
Julie, if I'd known you were waiting
for me, I would've come home sooner.

40:06.938 --> 40:08.679
How are you, honey?

40:10.174 --> 40:12.347
I have news, Daddy. Good news.

40:12.410 --> 40:14.549
Great. Would you like a drink?

40:14.612 --> 40:17.593
No. I'm going back on the wagon.

40:17.649 --> 40:19.754
Well, now that is great news.

40:19.817 --> 40:22.696
How'd it go with the district attorney?

40:22.987 --> 40:25.729
Have they come to their senses yet?

40:25.790 --> 40:27.861
Not yet, but Daddy, the good news.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.200
There's a miracle.

40:30.528 --> 40:32.940
After the meeting, I went to the doctor's.

40:33.631 --> 40:35.133
I'm pregnant.

40:37.969 --> 40:39.471
Does anyone else know this?

40:39.537 --> 40:42.882
I just talked to Kenneth.
Daddy, he was so happy, he cried.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.921
- And then we decided...
- Decided what?

40:44.976 --> 40:47.456
In the morning, we're going
to City Hall to get married.

40:47.512 --> 40:51.016
Oh, no. Oh, no. You can't rush this.

40:51.749 --> 40:53.251
You've got a trial.

40:53.318 --> 40:55.059
Kenneth doesn't want to wait.

40:56.020 --> 40:57.897
I'm sure he doesn't.

40:59.490 --> 41:00.662
Julie,

41:01.826 --> 41:04.238
did you ever show the family
trust papers to Kenneth?

41:04.295 --> 41:05.535
Maybe once, why?

41:06.364 --> 41:08.435
GOREN: That's it, reel him in.

41:08.499 --> 41:10.274
TURNER: Because there's a clause in the trust

41:10.335 --> 41:12.815
that says that, if in any case

41:12.870 --> 41:16.443
that you can't administer the trust,

41:16.507 --> 41:19.488
say you died, or went to prison,

41:20.211 --> 41:21.986
it would pass to your child,

41:22.046 --> 41:23.423
or your child's guardian.

41:23.481 --> 41:25.654
That will be Kenneth if you marry him.

41:25.717 --> 41:27.958
Well, I'm sure Kenneth would
take good care of things.

41:28.019 --> 41:29.293
No, no, no, no.

41:29.354 --> 41:31.459
Kenneth is not the kind of
man you think he is.

41:31.522 --> 41:33.092
What do you mean? I thought you liked him.

41:33.157 --> 41:36.229
(STAMMERING)
I do. But you can't marry him.

41:39.597 --> 41:42.009
I swore to your mother
I would never tell you this.

41:42.066 --> 41:44.410
She was convinced you wouldn't
be able to handle it.

41:45.136 --> 41:46.206
Handle what?

41:47.271 --> 41:50.218
Your mother received a photograph of Kenneth

41:50.274 --> 41:53.483
in a compromising situation.

41:55.847 --> 41:58.293
He's the father of my child now.

41:58.616 --> 42:01.324
I think I can forgive him an indiscretion.

42:01.386 --> 42:02.888
Not this one.

42:04.122 --> 42:05.760
He was with another man.

42:06.090 --> 42:07.330
Got him.

42:07.692 --> 42:11.162
Daddy, why didn't you tell me?

42:11.229 --> 42:13.106
You seemed so happy.

42:13.164 --> 42:14.575
You'd let me live a lie?

42:14.632 --> 42:16.908
- I thought that...
- Whoa, whoa, where's she going?

42:16.968 --> 42:18.470
...if you found out about
his preference later,

42:18.536 --> 42:20.140
- Where's she going? ...
- you'd learn to live with it.

42:20.204 --> 42:23.515
Is that what mother did?
Learn to live with it?

42:25.943 --> 42:27.445
TURNER: What are you talking about?

42:27.512 --> 42:30.186
No. no. We gotta get in there.
We gotta get in there!

42:32.950 --> 42:36.329
JULIE: You never had anything for me.
Ever. You never loved me.

42:36.387 --> 42:37.957
Mom did, but you didn't.

42:38.022 --> 42:39.160
TURNER: Julie.

42:41.826 --> 42:44.807
You bastard! How could you do this to me?

42:44.862 --> 42:46.637
Our whole life was a lie!

42:46.697 --> 42:48.699
I was just a child.

42:49.500 --> 42:51.002
Mom loved me!

42:52.236 --> 42:55.080
Hey, if anyone deserved it...

42:55.139 --> 42:56.743
She wasn't ready.

42:56.808 --> 43:00.085
- Detective...
- No, no, no, I know that anger.

43:02.313 --> 43:04.520
I should've seen it coming.

43:04.582 --> 43:06.357
