09:18.099 --> 09:19.976
Hey, you guys, uh...

09:20.101 --> 09:22.645
sorry I'm late-- surf
practice ran long today.

09:22.770 --> 09:24.647
Well, I don't see
how that affects you.

09:24.772 --> 09:25.606
Talked to your
coach today.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.192
He said he kicked
you off the team

09:27.317 --> 09:28.151
'cause you missed
too many practices.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.777
Why is that?

09:29.903 --> 09:30.862
Uh...

09:30.987 --> 09:32.739
(beeping)

09:34.241 --> 09:36.243
Where were you, Dixon?
(beeping continues)

09:36.368 --> 09:37.785
DEBBIE:
Dixon, answer your father.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.330
Put your cell phone down
when I'm talking to you.

09:40.455 --> 09:41.664
(beeping)

09:41.789 --> 09:42.623
Dixon.

09:42.749 --> 09:43.250
(beeping)

09:43.375 --> 09:44.334
HARRY:
Dixon!

09:44.459 --> 09:46.127
Fine! Fine.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.796
Uh, you guys want to know
what's going on?

09:48.922 --> 09:50.465
I-I got a girl pregnant.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.343
(panting)

10:16.491 --> 10:18.868
Look...
DEBBIE:
Don't.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.287
Don't talk.

10:20.412 --> 10:22.372
I don't know what to say.

10:22.497 --> 10:24.249
You didn't just get
a girl pregnant,

10:24.374 --> 10:26.042
you got a woman pregnant.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.877
An adult woman

10:28.002 --> 10:29.087
you have been
secretly dating.

10:29.212 --> 10:30.422
You lied to her.

10:30.547 --> 10:32.340
You lied to us.
DIXON:
I know.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.092
I screwed up; I get it.
DEBBIE:
Do you?

10:34.217 --> 10:35.843
Do you get it?

10:35.969 --> 10:37.845
Because if she has this baby,

10:37.971 --> 10:39.222
you're gonna
be a father.

10:39.347 --> 10:41.015
You will have
brought a child

10:41.141 --> 10:42.142
into this world.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.102
Your life as you know it
will be over.

10:44.227 --> 10:45.728
No.

10:45.853 --> 10:47.564
That's not true.

10:47.730 --> 10:48.898
Everything
doesn't have to change.

10:49.023 --> 10:50.066
I mean,

10:50.191 --> 10:51.276
Dad had a kid

10:51.401 --> 10:52.819
when he was
a teenager.

10:54.279 --> 10:55.822
(stammers)

10:55.947 --> 10:57.698
I made a mistake.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.659
A-And so did I.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.911
I mean, I sw... I swear I don't
even know how this happened.

11:02.036 --> 11:02.996
Oh...

11:03.121 --> 11:04.705
We were safe almost every time.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.249
Almost?

11:06.374 --> 11:08.001
You used protection almost
every time?

11:08.126 --> 11:09.419
Yeah...

11:09.544 --> 11:11.338
Don't--

11:11.463 --> 11:14.132
don't you say another word.

11:18.970 --> 11:21.431
(phone beeps)

11:21.556 --> 11:23.224
That her?

11:25.059 --> 11:26.060
Yeah.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.937
Yeah, she says

11:28.062 --> 11:29.105
she's having cramps.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.067
I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.319
Get your coat.

11:34.444 --> 11:36.279
You're going over there.

11:38.072 --> 11:39.533
Oh, you came.

11:40.492 --> 11:41.409
And you brought...

11:41.535 --> 11:42.410
His mother.

11:42.536 --> 11:43.828
Um...

11:45.330 --> 11:47.415
You know, honestly
I'm feeling much better.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.459
I-I didn't mean to
freak you guys out. I-I...

11:49.584 --> 11:50.793
The cramps are completely gone.

11:50.918 --> 11:52.629
I think maybe it was
something I ate, or...

11:52.753 --> 11:55.714
You know what, you
should just sit, okay?

11:55.840 --> 11:57.342
Now if you give me
the name of your doctor,

11:57.467 --> 11:59.344
I'll just call and make
sure everything's okay.
I, um, well...

11:59.469 --> 12:00.512
Do you not have a doctor?

12:00.637 --> 12:02.305
No, no, no, no,
it's Dr. Alderman.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.974
But honestly, I'm fine.
You don't have to call.

12:05.099 --> 12:06.893
I think if I get a little
rest, I should be fine.

12:07.018 --> 12:08.144
Well, that's good.

12:08.269 --> 12:11.022
Mom, why don't
we just let Sasha rest?

12:11.147 --> 12:12.315
Yeah.
Oh, yes, of course

12:12.440 --> 12:13.567
you should get some rest,

12:13.692 --> 12:14.984
and I'm glad
that you're feeling better.

12:15.109 --> 12:17.820
If you don't mind me asking,
how far along are you?

12:17.945 --> 12:20.240
Uh, a month.

12:20.365 --> 12:21.408
And you've been to your doctor?

12:21.533 --> 12:23.034
Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.161
I went and I did all the tests
and the whole sonogram

12:25.286 --> 12:26.329
and everything is great.

12:26.454 --> 12:27.914
The baby looks great.

12:28.039 --> 12:30.250
(chuckles)

12:30.375 --> 12:33.628
Um, Dixon did mention that you
were thinking about keeping it.

12:33.752 --> 12:35.672
Are you sure about
that decision?

12:35.796 --> 12:40.009
You know, that really isn't
any of your business.

12:40.134 --> 12:42.512
Well, I just want to discuss...

12:42.637 --> 12:44.472
Look, what I do or don't do
with this baby

12:44.598 --> 12:46.349
is a private matter

12:46.474 --> 12:47.934
between me and Dixon.

12:48.059 --> 12:52.564
You know, I need some rest.
And you need to leave.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.193
Okay.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.279
We'll talk later?

12:59.404 --> 13:00.614
Yeah.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.658
Yeah.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.288
You take care of yourself,
Sasha.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.296
Liam.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.214
Come here a minute.

13:18.339 --> 13:20.049
Guess who got
an honorable mention

13:20.174 --> 13:23.052
in the city-wide
essay contest?

13:23.177 --> 13:24.512
You.
Yeah?

13:24.638 --> 13:27.265
What, they give everyone who
entered an honorable mention?

13:27.390 --> 13:28.558
No, they didn't.

13:28.683 --> 13:30.059
It's a real
accomplishment, Liam.

13:30.184 --> 13:33.688
Come on, man, I'm not
saying you just won

13:33.812 --> 13:35.814
the World Series of Poker, but,
you know, it's something.

13:35.940 --> 13:39.402
Okay, well, I'm not going
to give you a high-five,

13:39.527 --> 13:40.695
if that's what
you're hoping.

13:40.819 --> 13:42.029
Come on, real quick.
Nobody's looking.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.364
Get out of here.
Down low?

13:43.490 --> 13:44.574
You're a freak,
Mr. Matthews.

13:48.578 --> 13:50.371
(bell ringing)

13:50.497 --> 13:52.206
Nice.
Aw, dude.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.417
Ooh, you're getting better.
You got two in a row there.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.169
I'm learning, okay?

13:56.294 --> 13:58.254
You better back off, before
I learn with your nut sack.

13:58.379 --> 13:59.838
Ooh.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.549
Oh, dude, I almost forgot--
I heard back from my mom.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.635
We are totally on the list
for the N.E.R.D. party.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.303
Can't wait.
It's gonna be cool.

14:05.428 --> 14:06.971
Dude, my mom totally
hooked us up.

14:07.096 --> 14:10.642
Hollywood parties
aren't my thing.

14:10.767 --> 14:12.226
I'll see you guys at the beach.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.729
Bye.
Later.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.109
(engine revving)

14:22.069 --> 14:23.780
I'll miss you.

14:23.904 --> 14:25.406
I'll call you when
I'm on my way home.

14:25.532 --> 14:26.907
Bye.

14:28.576 --> 14:29.577
(tires squealing)

14:29.703 --> 14:31.120
Hey, Annie.

14:31.245 --> 14:32.246
Can I talk to you?

14:32.372 --> 14:33.623
Oh, sure.

14:33.748 --> 14:35.583
Hey, uh, this might be
none of my business,

14:35.709 --> 14:37.502
but I just
heard something

14:37.627 --> 14:40.630
pretty messed up and I want you
to know right away, all right?

14:40.755 --> 14:42.131
Okay.
Jasper's a drug dealer.

14:42.256 --> 14:44.592
What?

14:44.718 --> 14:46.177
What are you talking about?

14:46.302 --> 14:48.471
Look, I have a friend
whose friend's dealer is Jasper.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.598
Oh, you know someone
who knows someone.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.308
No, I know how it sounds,

14:52.433 --> 14:54.227
but this friend,
she's pretty trustworthy.

14:54.352 --> 14:57.689
And so am I. There's no
reason for me to lie to you.

14:57.814 --> 15:00.066
I'm just telling you this
because we used to be friends.

15:01.442 --> 15:02.610
And I guess
I'm worried about you.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.945
Yeah, well, don't be.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.159
(sighs)

15:10.284 --> 15:14.080
♪ ♪

15:14.205 --> 15:17.667
JEN:
Can I get a French 75?

15:17.792 --> 15:18.710
Oh, hey, you're Ryan's friend.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.506
Rachel?

15:23.631 --> 15:25.341
Ramona.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.176
Oh, we met the other night,
right?

15:27.301 --> 15:28.803
Oh, how funny.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.012
I found myself
in the neighborhood,

15:30.137 --> 15:31.514
and I remembered hearing
about this place,

15:31.639 --> 15:32.640
so I thought I'd come in

15:32.766 --> 15:34.768
and check out
the scene.

15:34.893 --> 15:36.561
It's so funny, I totally
didn't recognize you.

15:36.686 --> 15:37.937
You're much older
looking close up.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.232
Sorry.

15:41.357 --> 15:43.359
That didn't come out right.
No, that's all right.

15:43.484 --> 15:45.653
I guess I could look
pretty young from a distance.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.407
So could I get
that French 75,

15:49.532 --> 15:50.450
or are you awfully busy?

15:50.575 --> 15:52.577
Yeah, sorry.

15:52.702 --> 15:54.036
We don't have any champagne.

15:54.161 --> 15:55.914
No-- okay, tell you what--

15:56.038 --> 15:59.500
sweetie, why don't you just
grab me a glass of water.

16:03.421 --> 16:05.882
So tell me about yourself.

16:06.006 --> 16:09.719
What are you-- uh...
an aspiring actress?

16:09.844 --> 16:11.178
A model?

16:11.304 --> 16:13.347
No--

16:13.473 --> 16:15.809
you're definitely
not a model.

16:15.934 --> 16:18.060
Maybe you're a
singer-songwriter.

16:18.185 --> 16:20.146
That's it. You look like
a singer-songwriter.

16:20.271 --> 16:22.440
I'm a bartender, actually.

16:22.565 --> 16:25.359
Ryan is such a softy.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.153
Yeah, why is that?

16:27.278 --> 16:29.614
Well, just to take on

16:29.739 --> 16:31.574
a charity case like you.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.367
I mean, let's face it--

16:33.493 --> 16:36.203
you're not exactly the type
of woman he normally dates.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.664
He's so sweet.

16:37.789 --> 16:40.458
Don't you think so?

16:42.209 --> 16:44.253
(knocking)

16:44.378 --> 16:46.756
Ade?

16:46.881 --> 16:49.008
Hey.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.682
Ade, hey.

16:55.807 --> 16:56.850
What's going on?

16:56.975 --> 16:58.726
Why weren't you
at school today?

16:58.852 --> 17:01.187
'Cause I'm a terrible person.

17:01.312 --> 17:04.272
I ruined the best thing
that ever happened to me.

17:04.397 --> 17:06.150
Navid hates me.

17:06.275 --> 17:07.443
I sang for him,

17:07.568 --> 17:09.153
and he still
rejected me.

17:09.278 --> 17:11.739
You sang for him?

17:11.865 --> 17:14.742
I brought him my guitar,
and I serenaded him.

17:14.867 --> 17:18.287
Wow, that--
that's special.

17:18.412 --> 17:21.207
I begged for his forgiveness,
and he said no.

17:23.835 --> 17:27.296
I'd do anything to make
my heart stop hurting.

17:29.590 --> 17:34.470
Maybe for now, you...
you should go to a meeting.

17:34.595 --> 17:36.806
I just want the pain to stop.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.563
Harry, I got
a hangnail this morning

17:43.688 --> 17:45.773
and I took out my nail scissors,
and that's when I remembered--

17:45.899 --> 17:48.234
I met Sasha at the nail salon.

17:48.359 --> 17:49.318
Who-- hangnail-- what?

17:49.443 --> 17:50.862
Sasha.

17:50.987 --> 17:52.697
It's a little
coincidental, huh?

17:52.822 --> 17:54.198
I thought she
looked familiar.

17:54.323 --> 17:56.492
Oh, my God, I showed her
a picture of Dixon.

17:56.617 --> 17:57.577
I bet they were

17:57.702 --> 17:59.328
already going out,
and she acted as if

17:59.453 --> 18:01.414
she didn't know who I was.
Oh, this girl is weird.

18:01.539 --> 18:02.832
Deb...
I mean, what
kind of an adult

18:02.957 --> 18:04.834
dates a high school student?

18:04.959 --> 18:06.502
Call it women's intuition,

18:06.627 --> 18:07.879
but I just know that there is
something off about her.

18:08.004 --> 18:09.422
It's how she
acts towards Dixon.

18:09.547 --> 18:12.008
The way she touched his arm

18:12.132 --> 18:13.467
when they're
already broken up.
Touched his arm?

18:13.593 --> 18:14.844
And the sonogram.

18:14.969 --> 18:17.221
I didn't even tell you
about the sonogram.
Deb...

18:17.346 --> 18:19.390
She's not pregnant.
She's lying.
Deb, stop.

18:19.515 --> 18:22.060
I wish it weren't true, too.

18:22.184 --> 18:24.395
Harry, it just--
it doesn't make any sense.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.396
I know.

18:25.521 --> 18:26.898
I know.

18:27.899 --> 18:30.944
I know.

18:35.406 --> 18:37.617
SILVER:
Navid, hey.

18:37.742 --> 18:39.201
We need to talk to you.

18:39.326 --> 18:40.620
Sure.

18:40.745 --> 18:42.538
Adrianna's not
doing so well.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.874

Oh, you don't
have to...
