00:01.334 --> 00:04.671
There's 2 ways you can look
at anything in this life.

00:04.705 --> 00:06.206
Take my job,
for instance.

00:06.239 --> 00:07.641
I could get up
every morning

00:07.674 --> 00:10.844
And go...(WHINING)

00:10.877 --> 00:13.346
I don't wanna go and help
a bunch of kids.

00:13.379 --> 00:14.447
I'm tired.

00:14.480 --> 00:15.415
But I don't.

00:15.448 --> 00:17.951
I get up and put on
my shirt and my tie,

00:17.984 --> 00:20.621
and I say, "Hot dog,
let me at 'em!"

00:20.654 --> 00:23.924
Do you actually say
the words "hot dog"?

00:23.957 --> 00:25.491
Yes, I do.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.562
I know you're struggling.

00:28.595 --> 00:31.031
That's what they made
guidance counselors for‐‐

00:31.064 --> 00:32.432
To help you.

00:32.465 --> 00:35.201
I understand you've just
been through puberty.

00:35.235 --> 00:36.703
You guys are tall.

00:36.737 --> 00:39.305
I'm surprised you fit
through that door,
quite frankly. OK?

00:39.339 --> 00:40.541
A lot of times
you might see,

00:40.574 --> 00:42.142
maybe you're taking
a shower or something,

00:42.175 --> 00:43.677
and you go,
"What are these?"

00:43.710 --> 00:45.011
"What's that?"

00:45.045 --> 00:48.214
But you feel alone
and confused,

00:48.248 --> 00:51.417
and you don't think
anyone understands.

00:51.451 --> 00:53.954
Well, I do.

00:53.987 --> 00:56.022
Lots of people do,

00:56.056 --> 00:58.625
even Mr. Alice Cooper.

00:58.659 --> 01:00.694
Bet you don't think
he's a square, do you?

01:00.727 --> 01:02.763
No, man.
Alice Cooper rocks.

as much as I do
right now.

01:52.012 --> 01:55.048
Guys, Mr. Rosso's really
good at the guitar.

01:55.081 --> 01:56.249
Some of those chords
are hard.

01:56.282 --> 01:58.952
Lindsay.
What?

01:58.985 --> 02:00.887
You're not gonna
sing again, are you?

02:00.921 --> 02:03.356
No. I was having
fun in there,

02:03.389 --> 02:04.925
but I'm worried
about you.

02:04.958 --> 02:05.992
Why?

02:06.026 --> 02:08.128
Because you're not
one of them.

02:08.161 --> 02:10.096
You're a different breed.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.232
I'm just worried because,
before you know it,

02:12.265 --> 02:14.568
you're gonna have to start
applying for colleges.

02:14.601 --> 02:17.137
And if you keep going
the way you're going,

02:17.170 --> 02:19.339
some of those colleges
may not want you.

02:19.372 --> 02:22.208
Well, maybe
I don't want them.

02:22.242 --> 02:25.579
Not everybody in this world
has to go to college.

02:25.612 --> 02:27.347
You know who didn't
go to college?

02:27.714 --> 02:29.082
Einstein.

02:29.115 --> 02:30.617

sent you a birthday card.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.259
What is it?

03:47.060 --> 03:48.729
Oh, my God.

03:50.296 --> 03:53.534
They sent me $300
for my college fund.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.801
Wow.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.269
Through the mail?

03:56.302 --> 03:57.504
She's lucky that
wasn't intercepted

03:57.538 --> 04:00.774
by some junkie working
for the post office.

treat for us tonight.

Harold?

04:04.845 --> 04:05.779
Oh, yes.

04:05.812 --> 04:08.414
I was visiting Mr. Prieh
at his store today.

04:08.448 --> 04:10.083
And he was
selling a game

04:10.116 --> 04:11.752
that my family and I
used to play

04:11.785 --> 04:14.020
when I was a kid‐‐
every Friday night.

04:14.955 --> 04:15.956
Pit.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.290
"Pit"?

04:17.323 --> 04:19.926
Pit.
Sounds like fun.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.027
It is.

04:21.061 --> 04:22.428
It's a stock‐trading game.

04:22.462 --> 04:24.565
We all yet across the table
at each other

04:24.598 --> 04:27.367
trying to get
the other players
to trade stocks with us.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.636
So we all sit
around the table,
and you yell at us?

04:29.670 --> 04:31.772
You do that to us
every night.

04:31.805 --> 04:34.240
JEAN: I think
it sounds like fun.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.408
Yeah, well, have
a good time.

04:35.441 --> 04:37.744
I'm gonna go out
on Friday night.

04:37.778 --> 04:38.945
Oh, yeah. Me, too.

04:40.046 --> 04:41.682
You know what?

04:41.715 --> 04:44.384
I'm sick and tired
of you two acting

04:44.417 --> 04:46.452
as though you don't
belong to a family.

04:46.486 --> 04:48.555
You act like you're
staying at a hotel

04:48.589 --> 04:51.291
and we're your employees.
Well, guess what?

04:51.324 --> 04:53.426
We are not your employees.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.161
We're your parents.

04:55.195 --> 04:57.664
Now, we created you,
and we deserve respect.

04:58.098 --> 04:59.399
We respect you.

04:59.432 --> 05:01.702
Oh, you can hardly stand
to be around us.

05:02.402 --> 05:03.637
When you two were kids,

05:03.670 --> 05:06.239
you used to run
around naked

05:06.272 --> 05:08.374
and lay in bed with us
all night.

05:08.408 --> 05:09.876
We bathed you,

05:09.910 --> 05:12.579
and we cleaned your butts
when you pooped.
And we loved it.

05:12.613 --> 05:15.248
Now we try
to pat you on the head,

05:15.281 --> 05:17.383
and you run
for the hills.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.686
Well, I'm fed up.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.555
We are going to be close
from now on,

05:21.588 --> 05:23.456
whether you
like it or not.

05:23.489 --> 05:25.692
We are going to spend
quality time together,

05:25.726 --> 05:27.994
and we're going
to enjoy it, damn it!

05:34.100 --> 05:36.302
The Weirs are playing
Pit this Friday.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.538
Get used to it.

05:38.705 --> 05:40.674
Natural selection
is a process

05:40.707 --> 05:43.476
in which weak
and inferior genes

05:43.510 --> 05:45.679
are weeded out
of the gene pool.

05:45.712 --> 05:47.581

know this concept

kissing a monkey
on TV last night.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.153
On the news?

07:00.186 --> 07:01.555
No, no, no.
It was in a movie.

07:01.588 --> 07:02.956
He's a pretty
good actor.

07:02.989 --> 07:04.625
So was the monkey...

07:10.296 --> 07:11.932
Uh, hi.

07:12.799 --> 07:14.701
I'm sorry.
Is this your table?

07:15.502 --> 07:16.637
Well, we don't own it,

07:16.670 --> 07:19.139
but we kinda
sit here every day.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.373
I can sit somewhere else.

you come from?

07:32.586 --> 07:34.855

transferred here

07:34.888 --> 07:36.422
to work
for General Motors.

07:36.456 --> 07:39.225
Really? My dad drives
a Coup De Ville,

07:39.259 --> 07:41.127
so we're practically
related.

07:47.834 --> 07:49.770
You gotta be careful
who you hang out with.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.105
There are a lot
of characters
in this school.

07:54.708 --> 07:57.978
So, we saw you
in our biology class.

07:58.011 --> 07:59.379
How did you like it?

07:59.412 --> 08:00.814
Uh, it was OK.

08:00.847 --> 08:02.849
Teacher seemed
kinda weird, though.

08:02.883 --> 08:04.250
Once he ran over
an old lady,

08:04.284 --> 08:05.686
and then he blamed it
on his car.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.120
He said the accelerator
got stuck.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.590
Really? We had this teacher
at our school,

08:09.623 --> 08:11.091
and this guy
broke into his house,

08:11.124 --> 08:12.258
so the teacher shot him.

08:13.226 --> 08:14.260
With a gun?

08:14.294 --> 08:15.962
Yeah, but he didn't
go to jail,

08:15.996 --> 08:17.898
'cause I guess if someone
breaks into your house,

08:17.931 --> 08:19.533
you're allowed
to shoot him.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.003
Our shop teacher got
his hair caught
in a lathe

08:23.036 --> 08:25.405
and then he got
his whole scalp
torn off

08:25.438 --> 08:28.008
and now he has
to wear a wig.

Our shop teacher
got his pinky cut off
by the radial arm saw.

08:31.277 --> 08:33.914

to sew it back on,
it didn't fit anymore.

and let me know.

let you bug us.

shut up.

over the rest of us.

I look mature.
Nobody ever stops me.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.336
Hey, Daniel,
do you have one?

10:03.369 --> 10:05.972
(EVERYONE LAUGHS)

10:06.006 --> 10:09.475
Some stupid bouncer
asked what
my star sign was.

10:09.510 --> 10:11.144
I didn't know,
so he snagged it.

10:11.177 --> 10:15.549
Aw. It's Capricorn,
Cancer, Capricorn.

10:15.582 --> 10:18.284
Dude, I hate
astrology.

10:18.318 --> 10:21.354
What, everybody born in
the same month is gonna
have the same life?

10:22.488 --> 10:24.658
Hey, you guys.

10:24.691 --> 10:27.360
We should get fake I. D. s
and go see Feedback.

10:28.428 --> 10:30.831
Howie Gelfand
sells fake I. D. s,

10:30.864 --> 10:32.833
but they cost like
uh, ton of money.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.568
I can't‐‐I ain't got
that kind of cash.

10:34.601 --> 10:37.771
Well, it just
so happens that...

10:37.804 --> 10:39.873
I came into
a little bit of cash.

10:39.906 --> 10:41.675
I could lend
you guys some.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.077
Well, well, well.

10:45.646 --> 10:49.349
I don't know why,
but I'm liking her
more and more every day.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.885
Join the club.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.453
Ew.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.355
What are you‐‐
I'm just saying‐‐

11:04.130 --> 11:07.233
Hey, Harris. Hey, Gordon.
You met our new friend
Maureen?

11:07.267 --> 11:08.301
Hi.
Hi.

11:08.334 --> 11:09.435
Hey, are you new
at our school?

11:09.469 --> 11:10.504
Yeah.

11:10.537 --> 11:11.572
You should stop by
the A. V. Room.

11:11.605 --> 11:12.673
We just got
a new beta machine.

11:12.706 --> 11:14.074
Thank you, Harris.
We're very late, though.

11:14.107 --> 11:16.242
Hey, Maureen,
tomorrow's pizza day
in the cafeteria.

11:16.276 --> 11:19.112
Yeah. It's made out
of real tomato sauce
and everything.

11:19.145 --> 11:20.681
Hi, Sam.
Hey.

11:20.714 --> 11:23.950
So, what are you guys
doing after school?
Want to do something?

11:23.984 --> 11:25.118
Yeah.

11:25.151 --> 11:26.820
OK. Great.
I don't have to be
home until dinner.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.321
I don't have
to be home ever.

11:30.924 --> 11:34.961
(DISCO MUSIC PLAYING)

11:42.468 --> 11:45.005
Oh, hi, uh, Howie!

11:45.038 --> 11:48.709
You come and take care
of these fine young people.

12:00.654 --> 12:01.888
We need some
fake I. D. s.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.390
Shh. I work here.

12:04.424 --> 12:05.458
Come here.

12:05.491 --> 12:08.862
I mean, we need
some slacks.

12:15.268 --> 12:16.870
Hello? All right.

12:18.338 --> 12:19.372
How many do you guys need?

12:20.206 --> 12:21.542
Four.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.276
Didn't I just get you one?

12:23.309 --> 12:24.611
You lose it already?

12:24.645 --> 12:26.947
Yeah. I'm not
into astrology, OK?

12:26.980 --> 12:29.616
Astrology.
It's not astrology.

12:29.650 --> 12:30.784
It's you, man.

12:30.817 --> 12:32.085
It's facts, it's who
you're supposed to be.

12:32.118 --> 12:34.588
June‐‐Cancer, Libra‐‐October,
Capricorn‐‐December.

12:34.621 --> 12:37.691
Know it. 1958.
You are them.

12:37.724 --> 12:39.526
You gonna give us
the I. D. s or not?

12:41.127 --> 12:42.663
Who's the chick?

12:42.696 --> 12:44.898
Hey, her name is
Lindsay, all right?

12:44.931 --> 12:48.434
Sorry, Bill Lambeer.
You got some
good timing.

12:48.468 --> 12:51.872
Just about to get a shipment
of genuine Canadian
drivers' licenses.

12:51.905 --> 12:53.139
Canadian?
Canadian.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.174
Canadian.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.409
I need to look at your faces,
memorize them...

12:56.442 --> 12:58.111
so I can find a match.

13:00.714 --> 13:03.283
Brown eyes, brown hair.

13:04.518 --> 13:07.020
Brown eyes, brown hair.

13:09.623 --> 13:13.326
Brown eyes,
lovely brown hair.

13:14.795 --> 13:16.362
Brown eyes, brown hair.

13:20.233 --> 13:21.467
OK. I got it.

13:22.669 --> 13:24.971
It's a 100 bucks.
Half in advance.

13:25.606 --> 13:27.040
Half of what?

13:27.541 --> 13:28.809
I got it.

13:28.842 --> 13:31.411
A chick with money.
You got good taste,
Stretch.

13:33.847 --> 13:34.915
All right.

13:34.948 --> 13:37.150
Excuse me.
Hey, Gelfand.
You know what?

13:37.183 --> 13:39.920
There's a box of Parisian
nightsuits in the back,

13:39.953 --> 13:41.822
and they're not gonna
unpack themselves,
all right?

13:41.855 --> 13:43.857
OK, sir. I'll be there
in one second. Thank you.

13:43.890 --> 13:45.391
I'm just, uh,
helping these customers.

13:45.425 --> 13:46.960
These look great, sir.
These look great.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.428
Ok. I'll see
you guys at 11:00, huh?

13:48.461 --> 13:50.731
Great. Thanks a lot.

13:50.764 --> 13:53.800
Had to bring
the big rocket,
didn't you?

13:53.834 --> 13:56.102
What? So I got
a big rocket.

13:56.136 --> 13:58.304
What am I supposed to do,
cut it in half?

13:58.939 --> 14:00.273
There she is.

14:01.742 --> 14:03.510
NEAL: she is beautiful.

14:04.477 --> 14:07.581
I can't believe
she's gonna hang
out with us.

14:07.614 --> 14:10.884
What if I'm asleep
right now and this
is just a dream,

14:10.917 --> 14:13.286
and any moment
Maureen and I
are gonna make love?

14:13.319 --> 14:14.154
Ew.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.856
Then what are
we doing here?

14:16.823 --> 14:18.258
Maybe this
is my nightmare.

14:18.291 --> 14:19.292
MAUREEN: Hey!

14:21.061 --> 14:24.965
Oh, my God,
she's running
to get to us.

14:31.738 --> 14:33.306
Hi, guys!

14:33.339 --> 14:35.676
Hey, Maureen.
Your rockets look great.

14:35.709 --> 14:38.111
God, Bill,
your rocket's huge.

14:38.144 --> 14:42.082
Oh, it is?
I hadn't noticed.

14:42.115 --> 14:44.885
I never launched
a rocket before.
This is gonna be fun.

14:44.918 --> 14:48.589
OK, Cape Canaveral,
ready for lift off.

14:48.622 --> 14:50.290
Ready to launch
this thing?

14:50.323 --> 14:51.892
Heck, yeah.

The Rusty Nail
with Nick.

16:25.852 --> 16:29.255
This is gonna be
like your guys'
first real date, huh?

16:30.090 --> 16:32.325
I don't know.
Not really.

16:32.358 --> 16:34.394
We're not going out
or anything.

16:34.427 --> 16:37.864
Yeah, but you're
definitely more
than friends.

16:37.898 --> 16:39.766
I don't know.

16:41.535 --> 16:44.170
We only kissed once,
and it's not‐‐

16:44.204 --> 16:45.539
It's not a big deal.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.974
I don't know.
There's a real
connection, man.

16:48.008 --> 16:49.475
I'm telling you guys,
she likes me.

16:49.510 --> 16:51.678
So are you guys,
like, a couple now?

16:51.712 --> 16:54.581
We're‐‐we're not into
labeling things,
you know?

16:54.615 --> 16:57.618
We have a more mature
relationship than that.

16:57.651 --> 17:00.253
Let's just say we have
an understanding.

17:00.286 --> 17:02.656
Well, I'm glad you have
an understanding,

17:02.689 --> 17:04.725
'cause I don't know
what the hell
you're talking about.

17:08.328 --> 17:11.064
So, is this what
having a girlfriend
is gonna be like?

17:11.097 --> 17:13.567
She's your best friend
and she's beautiful

17:13.600 --> 17:16.202
and you can say and do
anything in front of her?

17:16.236 --> 17:18.739
Well, my dad always says
that's what women
want you to think

17:18.772 --> 17:21.775
before you marry them.
That's how they suck you in.

17:21.808 --> 17:24.911
She's the kind of woman
you could cut the cheese
in front of.

17:24.945 --> 17:27.614
Oh, yeah, Bill, that's
what love is all about.

17:27.648 --> 17:33.053
It is. I mean, you couldn't
be in love with someone
if you couldn't.

17:34.555 --> 17:35.622
Think about it.

17:36.590 --> 17:38.024
That is true. Um...

17:38.058 --> 17:41.762
You have to sleep with
your wife every night
of your life.

17:41.795 --> 17:44.698
If you couldn't
blast one in bed,
you'd get physically ill.

17:44.731 --> 17:48.368
Oh, come on, guys.
You can't fart
in front of a woman.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.236
What do you think you do,
get up and run outside

17:50.270 --> 17:51.805
every time you have
to let one rip?

17:52.906 --> 17:54.274
You'd never get any sleep.

17:55.809 --> 17:58.512
I think I might
like Maureen, too.

17:58.545 --> 18:00.714
Wait. I thought
you liked Cindy Sanders.

18:00.747 --> 18:05.118
Well, I mean, I do,
but, you know,
Maureen talks to us.

18:05.686 --> 18:07.187
She's not as scary.

18:07.220 --> 18:11.091
No. No. I'm asking her out.
She clearly likes me best.

18:11.825 --> 18:13.193
How do you know?

18:13.226 --> 18:14.795
You see the way
she looks at me?

18:14.828 --> 18:16.597
She can barely
contain herself.

18:16.630 --> 18:19.399
You just happen to be
looking at her every time
she's thinking about me.

18:19.432 --> 18:23.136
OK. We're all in love
with her, and Maureen
likes all of us.

18:23.169 --> 18:26.673
So all we have to do now
is decide who gets her.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.176
How do we do that?

18:30.210 --> 18:32.913
The same way we decided
who had to stand in line

18:32.946 --> 18:35.115
For the Empire Strikes
Back tickets.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.184
I'll get the hat.

18:38.218 --> 18:41.888
Sam, excited about
the big Pit game
on Friday?

18:41.922 --> 18:44.257
Well, I guess
I have to be.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.727
Hey, honey, can you
come in here for a minute?

18:49.663 --> 18:51.097
I like Pit.

18:51.131 --> 18:53.867
You don't even know
what Pit is.

18:53.900 --> 18:59.906
Honey, you cannot
force these kids
to spend time with us.

18:59.940 --> 19:01.575
Did you know
that in some cultures,

19:01.608 --> 19:05.546
if your children shame you,
you're allowed to have
them executed?

19:05.579 --> 19:06.947
Well, I feel shamed.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.481
Oh, Harold.

19:08.515 --> 19:11.251
I'm not swinging an ax.
I just want them
to play Pit with me.

19:11.284 --> 19:13.419
I mean, is that
so horrible?

19:13.453 --> 19:16.923
Honey, it‐‐it's
like that old saying‐‐

19:16.957 --> 19:20.260
If you love something,
set it free.

19:20.293 --> 19:23.697
Maybe if we try
not to force it,
they'll come to us.

19:24.197 --> 19:26.499
Well, all right.

19:26.533 --> 19:27.568
There you go.

19:27.601 --> 19:29.736
They're free.
Let 'em free.
Let 'em go.

19:29.770 --> 19:30.804
See?

19:30.837 --> 19:32.172
Get back here.

19:37.110 --> 19:38.278
All right, Bill,
you pick.

19:38.311 --> 19:39.913
Wait. Why does
he get to pick?

19:39.946 --> 19:41.247
Because I don't
trust you.

19:43.116 --> 19:46.186
Just pick fast.
Don't try to feel
around for your paper.

19:46.219 --> 19:48.388
I'm not. I'm just
trying to pick one.

19:48.421 --> 19:49.956
Quit being
so paranoid.

19:53.794 --> 19:57.263
OK. Now we know that
the words on this paper

19:57.297 --> 19:59.432
could potentially
change our lives.
I don't want any‐‐

19:59.465 --> 20:01.334
Oh, come on.
Just open the paper.

20:05.038 --> 20:07.440
Oh, no. Not him.

20:09.242 --> 20:10.677
I'm the happiest man
in the world.

20:10.711 --> 20:14.147
Oh, great, Bill.
Now you can go and
fart in front of her.

20:14.180 --> 20:16.116
You'll make
quite the impression.

20:16.149 --> 20:18.852
Wait a minute.
He wet his paper
with spit.

20:18.885 --> 20:19.920
What?

20:19.953 --> 20:21.021
That's how
he wins every time.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.589
He just feels
for the wet one.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.358
Mrs. Maureen Haverchuck.

20:26.259 --> 20:28.294
Has a nice ring to it,
don't you think?

20:34.167 --> 20:35.268
Hey, Lindsay!

20:35.301 --> 20:38.071
How are we
this morning?

20:38.104 --> 20:39.540
I've got some
brochures

20:39.573 --> 20:41.074
from some
Ivy League schools.

20:41.107 --> 20:42.709
Several
are in color.

20:42.743 --> 20:44.911
Mr. Rosso, why can't
you just leave me alone?

20:44.945 --> 20:46.312
Because it's my job.

20:46.346 --> 20:47.714
I'm a guidance
counselor.

20:47.748 --> 20:49.082
I'm trying to guide you.

20:49.115 --> 20:51.251
Well, guide
someone else.

20:52.653 --> 20:55.355
I heard the words,
but your eyes said
something else.

20:55.388 --> 20:58.258
They said, "I'm lost.
I need your help.

20:58.291 --> 21:00.627
Don't listen to me.
Guide me."

21:00.661 --> 21:03.096
I don't need your help.
OK.

21:03.129 --> 21:04.297
Tell you what.
Why don't I just come

21:04.330 --> 21:06.900
and visit you then
in the prison‐‐

21:06.933 --> 21:08.101
where you'll
be living‐‐

21:08.134 --> 21:09.670
and give you some
really good advice,

21:09.703 --> 21:12.372
Like should you get
shanked in the yard
or the dining hall?

21:12.405 --> 21:13.940
When you have
your baby,

21:13.974 --> 21:15.642
which prison guard
should take care of it?
That kind of thing.

21:15.676 --> 21:17.978
That'd be a great
way to do my job,
don't you think?

21:18.011 --> 21:20.947
Only time will tell.
See you at the prison yard.

21:26.953 --> 21:30.857
All right. Ready
to get yourself
a new girlfriend?

21:30.891 --> 21:32.593
Never been readier.

21:32.626 --> 21:34.060
What are you
gonna say to her?

21:34.094 --> 21:35.128
I don't know.

21:35.161 --> 21:37.664
I'm just gonna let
the love...flow.

21:38.298 --> 21:40.366
God, this is
so unfair.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.668
Here she comes.

21:43.103 --> 21:44.370
I gotta get something
out of my locker.

21:44.404 --> 21:46.573
What are
you doing?
Go on.

21:46.607 --> 21:49.409
I told you guys.
That's why you should
let me have her.

21:49.442 --> 21:51.778
I know what to say
to a woman.

21:51.812 --> 21:54.114
Oh, wow. She's...
Talking to Vickie.

21:54.147 --> 21:55.415
How do you
like it?

21:55.448 --> 21:56.883
It's great.
I've met some
really nice people.

21:59.052 --> 22:00.286
What's wrong?

22:00.320 --> 22:03.023
The minute she
starts getting
with that crowd,

22:03.056 --> 22:04.324
we'll never
see her again.

22:04.357 --> 22:05.826
You think she'll
hang out with us

22:05.859 --> 22:08.428
after hanging out
with all those jocks
and cheerleaders?

22:08.962 --> 22:10.196
Why wouldn't she?

22:10.230 --> 22:11.965
Because they're
pod people.

22:11.998 --> 22:14.167
It's like <i>Invasion</i>
<i>of the Body Snatchers.</i>

22:14.200 --> 22:15.636
They'll make her
one of them.

22:15.669 --> 22:16.703
We'll see her
in a week,

22:16.737 --> 22:19.139
and she'll be all...
(SCREECHING)

22:19.172 --> 22:20.874
Oh, man!

22:20.907 --> 22:23.143
We've gotta get her
away from Vickie!

22:23.176 --> 22:25.579
What're we gonna do?
Um...

22:25.612 --> 22:26.947
Hello!

22:26.980 --> 22:29.115
Oh! Eli!
Eli, come here.

22:29.149 --> 22:31.417
Oh, hi! Hi, Bill!
Hi, Neal! Hi, Sam!

22:31.451 --> 22:32.619
Hi, Eli.
Hey, Eli.

22:32.653 --> 22:34.655
Eli, Vickie Appleby
told me

22:34.688 --> 22:37.724
she doesn't think
Three's Company
is funny.

22:37.758 --> 22:40.627
But it's the funniest
show on TV!

22:40.661 --> 22:44.130
I know. That's what
I told her, but...

22:45.599 --> 22:47.367
I'm gonna go
talk to her.

22:47.934 --> 22:48.969
OK.

22:50.937 --> 22:52.338
Do you
cheerlead?

22:52.372 --> 22:53.740
No, I‐‐
Excuse me.

22:53.774 --> 22:56.276
Three's Company
is the best show
on TV.

22:56.309 --> 22:57.911
Oh? Oh...

22:57.944 --> 22:59.045
Really?
Yes.

22:59.079 --> 23:00.881
The Ropers don't
want Jack living
with two girls

23:00.914 --> 23:03.049
because he doesn't
want any dirty stuff
going on

23:03.083 --> 23:04.851
in‐‐in his
apartment building.

23:05.952 --> 23:08.955
There was this scene
where Jack had lost
his voice...

23:08.989 --> 23:11.091
Maureen, do you
wanna come to
class with us?

23:11.124 --> 23:14.127
Oh. Sure. Uh...
Talk to you
later, Vickie.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.729
Oh. OK. Bye.

23:15.762 --> 23:18.031
So, which class
are you headed to?

23:18.064 --> 23:19.365
Oh, Social Studies.

23:19.399 --> 23:21.001
Oh, cool.
We're going
there, too.

23:21.401 --> 23:22.736
Cool.

23:23.403 --> 23:25.405
Congratulations,
everybody.

23:26.039 --> 23:27.173
You're all of age.

23:27.207 --> 23:28.441
Oh, yeah.

23:32.212 --> 23:35.215
Who the hell is
"Hesus H. Garcia"?

23:35.248 --> 23:37.784
It's hey‐zoos.
It's your new identity.

23:37.818 --> 23:39.686
Tell me that picture
doesn't look like you.

23:41.555 --> 23:43.857
This picture doesn't
look like me, man.

23:44.525 --> 23:45.692
Sure it does, man.

23:45.726 --> 23:47.528
Well, it's gotta
be better than mine.

23:47.561 --> 23:49.229
Mine looks
kinda Chinese.

23:49.262 --> 23:50.764
Yeah. Hey,
mine looks
Chinese, too.

23:50.797 --> 23:52.432
What's going on
with that?

23:52.465 --> 23:53.867
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:53.900 --> 23:56.603
There's a big
Vietnamese community
up there in Alberta.

23:56.637 --> 23:58.471
This says I'm 29.

23:58.505 --> 24:00.240
That doesn't matter.
Mine says I'm 34.

24:00.273 --> 24:02.543
I have no problems.

24:02.576 --> 24:04.778
Why don't you give
us the money back?

24:04.811 --> 24:07.213
That's top‐grade stuff.
You don't get refunds.

24:08.448 --> 24:10.116
Give us the money
back, all right?

24:13.854 --> 24:14.888
All right.

24:16.389 --> 24:18.124
It's hard to find
matches for you guys.

24:18.158 --> 24:19.793
No one in Canada
looks like you.

24:19.826 --> 24:21.294
You know what?

24:21.327 --> 24:23.597
I think I'm gonna go
with Jesus here.

24:23.630 --> 24:24.798
I think I can
pull it off.

24:24.831 --> 24:28.168
Finally, a sane man.
God, this is...

24:29.135 --> 24:31.371
Oh, guys, by the way...

24:31.404 --> 24:32.839
Tomorrow, at Silverman's,

24:32.873 --> 24:35.075
we're having a big sale‐‐
half off on all
dress shirts.

24:35.108 --> 24:37.143
Maybe you guys come by,
I'll hook you up.

24:37.744 --> 24:39.079
Be nice.

24:39.112 --> 24:40.213
Oh, thanks, Howie.

24:40.246 --> 24:41.982
Yeah. Thanks
for nothing.

24:42.015 --> 24:44.885
Wait. That's it?

24:44.918 --> 24:47.688
We don't have I. D. s,
and the band's
playing tonight.

24:47.721 --> 24:49.289
That was my
only connection.

24:49.322 --> 24:51.024
Yeah. I don't
know anybody.

24:51.057 --> 24:54.394
Wait. I think I might.

24:54.427 --> 24:55.862
Maybe we can
split up the day

24:55.896 --> 24:58.665
and make sure one of us
is with her between
each class.

24:58.699 --> 24:59.833
That way we can make sure

24:59.866 --> 25:01.835
she doesn't talk
to anyone but us.

25:04.538 --> 25:06.406
Hi!
Oh, no.

25:06.439 --> 25:07.674
It's Vickie.

25:08.174 --> 25:09.309
Where's Eli?

25:09.342 --> 25:10.476
Sam, quick,

25:10.511 --> 25:12.278
go talk to her about
<i>Three's Company.</i>

25:13.146 --> 25:14.480
Oh, hey, Maureen!

25:14.515 --> 25:16.249
You wanna come
sit with us?

25:16.282 --> 25:17.483
Oh. Yeah.

25:17.518 --> 25:19.085
I'll talk to you
in Algebra.

25:21.421 --> 25:23.189
Oh, you
got pudding.

25:25.091 --> 25:26.960
I like pudding, too.

25:26.993 --> 25:28.862
Yeah. I like it when
it's been sitting
around for a while,

25:28.895 --> 25:30.697
and it gets that
skin on the top.
Heh.

25:33.399 --> 25:36.102
Hi, Maureen.
Good to see
you again.

25:36.136 --> 25:37.170
Hi, Bill.

25:37.203 --> 25:38.639
Yeah, how's
your day going?

25:38.672 --> 25:40.607
Great. I've met
tons of new people.

25:41.875 --> 25:43.409
What are you doing
this weekend?

25:43.443 --> 25:44.845
Vickie invited me
to a party.

25:44.878 --> 25:46.713
That's gonna be
fun, huh?

25:48.481 --> 25:49.850
Wasn't that
nice of her?

25:53.219 --> 25:55.321
Hey...Millie...

25:55.355 --> 25:56.523
What's going on?

25:56.557 --> 25:59.192
Nothing. Just going
to Mathlete practice.

25:59.225 --> 26:02.228
Having a scrimmage
against Mount Clemon
next week.

26:02.262 --> 26:03.363
You wanna come?

26:03.396 --> 26:05.165
Uh, no, thanks.

26:05.198 --> 26:07.868
Do you ever talk
to your cousin
Toby anymore?

26:07.901 --> 26:10.336
No way. Not since
he went to jail.

26:10.370 --> 26:12.105
He's in jail?
He was.

26:12.138 --> 26:15.008
He got caught stealing
hood ornaments
off of cars.

26:15.041 --> 26:16.242
They weren't gonna
lock him up,

26:16.276 --> 26:18.512
but he called
the policeman
a bad word.

26:18.545 --> 26:20.246
Does he still
make fake I. D. s?

26:20.280 --> 26:23.116
I don't know.
My family doesn't
talk to him anymore.

26:23.149 --> 26:25.085
He was dropped
on the head when
he was a baby.

26:25.118 --> 26:27.087
That's why we think
he's a bad seed.

26:28.321 --> 26:30.190
Why do you want
a fake I. D.?

26:30.223 --> 26:31.725
So you can go
get loaded?

26:31.758 --> 26:35.195
No. I just wanna
hear this band play.

26:35.962 --> 26:37.363
That's why
there's records.

26:38.298 --> 26:39.833
Do you have
his number?

26:39.866 --> 26:42.468
I'm not gonna be
an accessory
to this crime.

26:42.503 --> 26:44.971
You know
where he lives.
Do it yourself.

26:45.639 --> 26:47.407
I heard
the drinking age

26:47.440 --> 26:49.743
is something
like 10 in Idaho.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.878
Well, I don't
think that's right.

26:54.615 --> 26:55.949
Wait. This is it.

26:57.651 --> 26:59.520
How'd you say you
know this guy?

26:59.553 --> 27:00.787
He's Millie's cousin.

27:00.821 --> 27:03.123
I used to know
him when I was
really little.

27:03.790 --> 27:05.859
I think he's
kinda scary now.

27:05.892 --> 27:07.661
I think we
can handle it.

27:14.267 --> 27:17.604
Look, the pharmacy's
closed, all right?
I don't got nothin'.

27:17.638 --> 27:19.640
I got no stuff.
Nothin'.

27:19.673 --> 27:21.141
Uh...No...

27:21.174 --> 27:22.375
Go home.

27:22.408 --> 27:24.511
We‐we're here
for the I. D. s?

27:24.545 --> 27:26.780
Oh, the I.D.s.
The I. D. s, yeah.

27:26.813 --> 27:29.650
All right. Only
one person's allowed
in at a time.

27:29.683 --> 27:32.118
One person.
You, McMurphy,
you come in.

27:32.152 --> 27:33.419
You two stay.

27:35.188 --> 27:36.222
All right.

27:36.256 --> 27:37.257
Hey, babies.

27:38.324 --> 27:39.726
Don't play with
that rooster!

27:39.760 --> 27:40.994
Don't play
with that rooster.

27:41.027 --> 27:44.264
That's not a nice,
petty‐pet rooster.

27:44.297 --> 27:45.365
I'm sorry.

27:45.398 --> 27:47.534
No. You're the one
who'll be sorry.

27:47.568 --> 27:48.869
Very dangerous.

27:49.603 --> 27:51.071
I understand.
I'm sorry.

27:58.912 --> 28:01.582
Hey, man, you got
a lot of stereos.

28:01.615 --> 28:02.749
Where'd you get
all this?

28:02.783 --> 28:04.017
Hey, don't bother
with that.

28:04.050 --> 28:05.519
Get‐‐get away
from there.

28:05.552 --> 28:07.053
Get away from
there, man.

28:07.087 --> 28:08.922
Don't even look
at that stuff.

28:16.663 --> 28:18.965
Oh, cool, man!
What's this?

28:18.999 --> 28:20.901
I got a green thumb.
Don't worry about it.

28:20.934 --> 28:23.103
Sit down, sit down.
Relax.

28:32.245 --> 28:33.479
Oh, cool.

28:33.514 --> 28:35.348
Wow, that looks
pretty accurate.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.083
It's a masterpiece.

28:37.117 --> 28:39.853
What, you just
made a stencil
and put that on?

28:41.321 --> 28:42.388
Yeah, you know.

28:43.389 --> 28:45.425
Wow. You just go to
any art supply store,

28:45.458 --> 28:46.960
you could get
that stuff, huh?

28:46.993 --> 28:50.230
And then you just‐‐
you need the laminating
machine, right?

28:50.263 --> 28:54.234
No. No, you
can't just buy a
laminating machine.

28:54.267 --> 28:58.038
You can't just go into
a store and buy one
like it's a toaster.

28:58.071 --> 28:59.606
Only corporations
have that stuff.

28:59.640 --> 29:01.742
It's very expensive.

29:01.775 --> 29:03.844
All right, man,
it's show time.

29:06.212 --> 29:08.148
You can't just get
a laminating machine.

29:08.181 --> 29:10.150
What, you wanna
go to jail?

29:10.851 --> 29:13.053
Right into the hot spot.

29:13.787 --> 29:16.489
All right...
And, you know...

29:16.523 --> 29:17.991
There's a window
here, right?

29:18.024 --> 29:19.526
I mean, there isn't
actually one,

29:19.560 --> 29:21.027
but pretend
that there is one,

29:21.061 --> 29:24.430
and don't put your face
out further than that,
all right?

29:24.464 --> 29:25.932
OK. All right.

29:30.403 --> 29:31.638
All right,
not like this,

29:31.672 --> 29:33.406
you know, back.

29:33.439 --> 29:35.141
Come back, you know?

29:35.175 --> 29:36.209
There you go.

29:36.643 --> 29:37.678
Good.

29:37.711 --> 29:38.945
And the hat,
take the hat‐‐

29:38.979 --> 29:40.446
You know,
what's with the hat?

29:41.882 --> 29:43.116
Good.
All right, now,

29:43.149 --> 29:45.285
look like you've been
waiting on line
for 2 hours.

29:45.318 --> 29:48.088
Look like you
don't want to have
your picture taken.

29:50.624 --> 29:52.559
Well, what
are we gonna do?

29:52.593 --> 29:54.427
Why should I help
you guys again?

29:54.460 --> 29:57.097
You weren't gonna
share her with me
the other day.

29:57.130 --> 29:59.032
Would you
share her
with us?

29:59.833 --> 30:01.067
Touche.

30:01.101 --> 30:02.168
So?

30:02.202 --> 30:03.369
What do we do?

30:03.403 --> 30:05.972
She's gonna be
at Vickie Appleby's
party on Saturday.

30:06.006 --> 30:08.274
And you guys
need to hang out
with her on Friday.

30:08.308 --> 30:10.310
Then, if you show her
the time of her life,

30:10.343 --> 30:13.446
maybe‐‐just maybe‐‐
she will continue
to base that life

30:13.479 --> 30:14.515
out of your
lunch table.

30:14.548 --> 30:15.582
Oh.

30:15.616 --> 30:17.551
What are
our chances?

30:17.584 --> 30:18.852
You don't
want to know.

30:19.520 --> 30:20.854
Where do we
take her?

30:20.887 --> 30:22.889
Well, there's
only one thing
that could compete

30:22.923 --> 30:25.225
with the
Vickie Appleby party.

All‐U‐Can‐Eat night at
the Iron Horse restaurant.

30:30.496 --> 30:32.365
Of course.
So obvious.

30:32.766 --> 30:34.034
To me it is.

30:38.138 --> 30:41.007
My God, you‐‐ you
are a beautiful girl.

30:41.041 --> 30:43.109
A woman.
Thanks.

30:43.143 --> 30:45.145
When we were kids,
you were really cute,

30:45.178 --> 30:47.514
but, I mean, I never
thought you would
turn out this hot.

30:50.316 --> 30:51.484
You go to McKinley?

30:51.518 --> 30:52.519
Mm‐hmm.

30:53.787 --> 30:55.455
It's a pretty
good school.
I went there.

30:55.488 --> 30:57.758
I almost graduated
from there a few
years ago.

30:57.791 --> 30:59.159
Oh, really?
Yeah.

30:59.192 --> 31:00.827
You hungry or something?
You want something to eat?

31:00.861 --> 31:02.495
Like, I have some
Freihoffer's cookies.

31:02.529 --> 31:04.531
You know, those
really hard to get,
from the East Coast.

31:04.565 --> 31:05.599
You want one?

31:05.632 --> 31:08.101
No, thanks,
I'm not hungry.

31:08.134 --> 31:09.736
Is this gonna
take a long time,
or what?

31:09.770 --> 31:12.472
Hey, be cool, man,
you know, the laminating
machine's gotta warm up.

31:12.506 --> 31:14.240
You know, you're not even
supposed to be back here.

31:14.274 --> 31:16.543
Broke my "one person
at a time" rule.

31:18.478 --> 31:20.113
Right.
All right, sorry.

31:20.146 --> 31:22.182
Hey, wanna go
see Yes at Cobo?

31:22.215 --> 31:23.650
I got tickets,
I got‐‐

31:23.684 --> 31:25.451
You know,
Richie Blackmore's
Rainbow is opening up.

31:25.485 --> 31:26.687
You know,
we could catch up.

31:26.720 --> 31:28.354
Oh, um...

31:28.388 --> 31:30.056
I don't
think I can.

31:32.025 --> 31:33.193
Yeah, you can, just...

31:33.226 --> 31:34.895
All right, give me
your phone number.

31:34.928 --> 31:36.296
Give me your
home number.

31:36.329 --> 31:37.330
I'll call you up.

31:37.864 --> 31:39.365
Well, um...

31:39.399 --> 31:41.702
Hey, you know,
actually, she's
my girlfriend, man,

31:41.735 --> 31:44.337
so do you think
maybe you could
stop hitting on her?

31:45.105 --> 31:46.707
No, no she's not.

31:46.740 --> 31:49.475
Yeah, I am his
girlfriend.

31:54.881 --> 31:56.917
Hey, man,
that's not cool.

31:56.950 --> 31:59.319
That's not cool,
you know, now you
make me feel like a fool.

31:59.352 --> 32:00.887
You know, for asking
for your number.

32:00.921 --> 32:03.189
No, you can have
my phone number.

32:03.223 --> 32:05.258
It's just that
I have a boyfriend.

32:05.792 --> 32:07.160
I don't need to ask.

32:07.193 --> 32:09.129
I could just get it
from my cousin Millie,
you know?

32:09.162 --> 32:10.496
I was just
being polite.

32:12.799 --> 32:14.668
You know, let's just
get this over with.

32:17.303 --> 32:19.005
It's 75 each.

32:19.039 --> 32:21.775
Hey, I thought
you said that
it was 40 each.

32:21.808 --> 32:23.677
Did I?
I think so.

32:24.511 --> 32:25.512
100 each.

32:28.014 --> 32:30.316
Let's just do it
and get it over with.

32:34.054 --> 32:35.922
Look at how much
hotter you look
in this one

32:35.956 --> 32:37.591
than in your real
driver's license.

32:39.192 --> 32:41.828
Whoa, is this one
fake, too?

32:41.862 --> 32:43.163
No, why?

32:44.030 --> 32:46.466
Because it says
you're 18.

32:48.669 --> 32:50.236
So, I was
left back one year.

32:50.937 --> 32:52.472
Well, I know.

32:52.506 --> 32:55.008
But still,
it wouldn't
make you 18.

32:57.811 --> 32:59.546
All right, I was
left back twice.

32:59.580 --> 33:01.147
OK, are you
happy now?

33:02.048 --> 33:03.717
There's no secrets
between us.

33:04.851 --> 33:06.086
All right.

33:06.119 --> 33:09.122
18, that makes me
jail bait.

33:10.223 --> 33:12.058
Hey! You better
watch out,

33:12.092 --> 33:14.227
I'm gonna call
the cops on you.

33:14.260 --> 33:17.263
Officer,
I didn't know,

33:17.297 --> 33:19.099
Look at her,
she looks
like she's 30.

33:19.132 --> 33:21.535
Ahh! No I don't!

I have cornered
the market on barley.

33:29.743 --> 33:31.011
What happened
to the corn?

33:31.044 --> 33:32.345
I'm looking
for corn, here.

33:32.378 --> 33:34.147
I don't know
where the corn went.

come on,

of high‐stakes
trading going on

in the Pit.

I'm gonna go out.

33:42.488 --> 33:43.323
Yeah, me, too.

33:43.356 --> 33:44.457
See you later.
Have a good night.

don't worry,
we will!

Be careful, OK?

begin.

33:50.496 --> 33:51.497
See, I told you.

33:51.532 --> 33:53.166
We should have
forced them
to stay with us.

33:53.199 --> 33:55.501
You want to keep
playing Pit?

33:55.536 --> 33:59.072
No. This is
a terrible game
with just 2 people.

Nobody's home.

a little sex?

Let's go.

34:15.021 --> 34:16.823
Hey, in the bedroom.

34:19.292 --> 34:21.227
So, how does
this all work?

34:21.261 --> 34:23.296
Well, we order
a lot of food,

34:23.329 --> 34:24.831
and then keep
asking for more

34:24.865 --> 34:26.299
until they go
out of business.

34:26.332 --> 34:28.101
My mom says
that it takes
a little while

34:28.134 --> 34:29.870
for your stomach
to tell your
brain its full.

34:29.903 --> 34:31.271
So you should
eat really fast.

34:31.304 --> 34:33.139
Yeah, but the only
problem is,

34:33.173 --> 34:34.541
the service
is really slow.

34:34.575 --> 34:36.442
Yeah, they take
forever on purpose,

34:36.476 --> 34:38.044
so you'll get full
while you wait.

34:38.078 --> 34:39.980
Watch how much bread
they bring us.

34:40.013 --> 34:41.782
Yeah, well,
I'm here
to eat ribs,

34:41.815 --> 34:44.150

Good evening.
Welcome to
the Iron Horse.

34:46.286 --> 34:48.589

here is really bad

'cause you don't
want us to eat much.

34:50.524 --> 34:51.658
What?

34:51.692 --> 34:54.160
I don't own the place,
i don't care how
much you eat.

34:54.194 --> 34:55.395
Are you sure?

34:55.428 --> 34:57.664
No, actually,
I'm a millionaire

34:57.698 --> 34:59.299
and I just
do this for fun.

than you can eat 'em,

but I want a 20% tip.

20? I thought
10 was the norm.

35:09.309 --> 35:12.613
15 is standard.
20 is classy.

20 it is.

Why are we
still talking?

Give 'em a big hand.

40:33.366 --> 40:36.670
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hold on, Sue,
hold on.

40:36.703 --> 40:39.673
I can't let you
serve our guests
plain old beer.

40:39.706 --> 40:43.043
Why don't you bring them
some of your finest pop,

40:43.510 --> 40:44.745
on the house.

40:45.478 --> 40:47.313
(MUSIC STARTS)

40:47.347 --> 40:52.218
Oh, I got those
under‐age drinkin' blues.

40:52.252 --> 40:53.920
Glug, glug, glug.

40:58.358 --> 40:59.826
Finest pop.

41:00.727 --> 41:01.762
Perfect.

41:05.666 --> 41:08.501
I was just
starting to like
that guy, too.

41:16.242 --> 41:17.644
SAM: The moment
of truth.

41:17.678 --> 41:18.845
VICKIE: Hey, Maureen?

41:18.879 --> 41:20.380
You want to
eat with us today.

41:20.413 --> 41:22.516
Oh, just a minute, OK?

41:25.451 --> 41:26.987
Hey, guys.

41:27.020 --> 41:30.023
Um, hey, do you mind
if I go over and sit
with those guys today?

41:34.094 --> 41:35.562
No, no, not at all.

41:37.430 --> 41:39.265
Do you want to come
and sit with me?

41:39.299 --> 41:40.534
Over there?

41:40.567 --> 41:42.368
Yeah, I mean, you don't
have to sit here forever

41:42.402 --> 41:43.637
if you don't want to.

41:43.670 --> 41:46.472
Yeah, but we
like it here.

41:46.507 --> 41:48.509
Yeah, go have
fun with your
friends.

41:48.542 --> 41:49.976
We'll be here
if you need us.

41:52.045 --> 41:53.279
OK.

41:53.313 --> 41:55.716
Oh, wait,
before you do...

41:55.749 --> 42:00.286
Just remember,
the jocks are only
after one thing.

42:00.320 --> 42:01.888
And be careful
around Vickie.

42:01.922 --> 42:04.124
She's a wolf
in sheep's clothing.

42:04.157 --> 42:06.893
And remember,
don't believe
everything they say

42:06.927 --> 42:09.429
about people
in the school.

42:09.462 --> 42:12.365
'Cause they don't
always take the time
to get to know everyone.

42:12.398 --> 42:14.234
Guys, I'm just
sitting 3 tables over,

42:14.267 --> 42:16.369
I'm not moving
back to Florida.

42:16.402 --> 42:18.805
Well, we know.

42:19.806 --> 42:21.174
See you
in Biology class?

42:22.075 --> 42:23.877
See you in
Biology class.

43:04.718 --> 43:06.787
Excuse me,
is this seat
taken?

43:08.589 --> 43:10.657
It is, by you,
my good man.

43:14.795 --> 43:17.097
Did you guy's happen
to see Three's Company
last night?

43:17.598 --> 43:19.065
It was so funny.

43:20.967 --> 43:22.068
What happened?

43:22.102 --> 43:24.170
I don't really remember,
there was a lot going on.

43:24.204 --> 43:25.271
Oh.

43:25.305 --> 43:27.040
Joyce Dewitt
is really hot.

43:27.073 --> 43:28.775
If I was Jack,
I'd have a very
hard time

43:28.809 --> 43:31.044
choosing between
the two lovely
ladies on the show

43:31.077 --> 43:33.647
because, you know,
one's a brunette,
one's a blonde,

43:33.680 --> 43:35.782
and, I mean,
who can choose?
