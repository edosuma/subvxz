00:31.999 --> 00:39.256
After having sailed a perilous trip,
I enjoyed again a quiet life.

00:39.339 --> 00:45.220
But soon I was tired and longed for oceans and adventure.

00:45.304 --> 00:49.850
<i>The report on my fifth trip begins here.</i>

04:04.246 --> 04:06.582
MANY YEARS LATER

04:26.143 --> 04:31.731
A very familiar scent of darkness and evil filled the air.

04:31.815 --> 04:34.693
I can not even hear voices.

04:37.654 --> 04:42.784
It is... black magic, Captain Sinbad.

04:42.867 --> 04:46.621
We die if we go ashore.

04:47.955 --> 04:53.127
- Let's sail away from this place.
- We should leave the port.

04:53.211 --> 04:58.799
We do not know yet.
I am going to the palace.

05:33.374 --> 05:40.340
- Zohreh! What happened?
- Take your men. We advocate.

05:40.423 --> 05:43.009
THE NIGHT BEFORE

05:47.930 --> 05:54.770
Sultan was like a father to me,
and the princess was my life.

06:32.765 --> 06:37.562
For His transcendent majesty and his hip,

06:37.645 --> 06:41.232
let me introduce wizard Hassan.

06:50.741 --> 06:55.663
Their famous and unique Majesties.

06:55.746 --> 06:59.124
I am honored being called to Maleks court.

06:59.208 --> 07:03.045
Tonight I will give one forestalling

07:03.128 --> 07:07.799
which gives thrill of joy of everyone who sees it.

07:17.350 --> 07:23.523
This little box contains nothing but sand from my home.

07:23.606 --> 07:29.445
But see how it shows us pictures from a reality in our time.

08:43.683 --> 08:47.021
It was really amazing.

08:47.104 --> 08:51.316
Tell Hassan how you perform such magic tricks?

08:51.400 --> 08:57.531
- And what's in the box?
- Your Majesty, I promise...

08:57.614 --> 09:01.284
...that the box contains only sand from my home.

09:01.368 --> 09:07.457
But you must allow this humble sorcerer its secrets.

09:07.540 --> 09:11.252
Humble? Do not be so modest.

09:11.336 --> 09:18.384
My advisors say that you have amazing
abilities, and it looks Mon.

09:18.468 --> 09:25.600
My friend, I promise that you will be richly rewarded
at the end of this evening.

09:25.683 --> 09:29.478
I am not in doubt Your Majesty.

09:29.562 --> 09:35.234
With your permission,
I will show my tricks for Princess

09:35.317 --> 09:39.989
to celebrate her upcoming marriage with Captain Sinbad.

09:40.072 --> 09:46.453
I wonder why he did not participate in this festive evening.

09:50.832 --> 09:54.419
We sailed for many days and nights

09:54.503 --> 09:59.841
until we finally came to a large, uninhabited island.

09:59.925 --> 10:03.261
I thought we in any case.

12:00.708 --> 12:05.004
I can not leave the island without amulet Goddess.

12:55.428 --> 12:58.181
It was a little too personally!

13:52.817 --> 13:58.781
We have lots of gold and jewels.
What is so special about the amulet?

13:59.824 --> 14:05.079
It must be my wedding to the princess.
She dreamed of it.

14:05.162 --> 14:09.333
And now you will meet her dreams.

14:09.416 --> 14:13.921
Men give flowers.
I give magical amulets.

14:15.380 --> 14:20.427
I wish that you did not waste
invisibility gift at a wedding.

14:20.510 --> 14:24.264
You speak like a true thief, Firooz.

14:25.640 --> 14:27.934
We sail for home.

14:38.444 --> 14:44.200
With your permission,
I will show my tricks for Princess

14:44.283 --> 14:49.038
to celebrate her upcoming marriage with Captain Sinbad.

14:49.122 --> 14:55.670
I wonder why he do not participate in this festive evening.

14:55.753 --> 14:59.381
- Here you go.
- Princess.

15:11.435 --> 15:16.148
I can only imagine one thing which
is a beautiful princess worthy.

15:20.902 --> 15:22.863
Heaven.

15:27.158 --> 15:29.828
For you, my butterfly.

15:33.039 --> 15:38.795
I wish that this moment could last an eternity.

15:38.878 --> 15:43.007
Your Majesty has his way.

16:05.320 --> 16:07.864
Parisa!

16:13.620 --> 16:15.580
Parisa!

16:33.723 --> 16:37.351
Follow me and take your men with.

16:43.733 --> 16:49.155
- Zohreh, what happened?
- Have you your life amulet with you?

16:49.238 --> 16:51.949
Give us the amulet.

16:54.618 --> 16:59.248
But Parisa said that gave invisibility gift.

16:59.331 --> 17:02.334
Her dream is not easily decipherable.

17:02.417 --> 17:07.798
There is a reason it is called life amulet.

17:19.267 --> 17:25.647
- Treason!
- Your Highness. Zohreh told everything.

17:25.732 --> 17:28.985
I'm afraid that he has taken her.

17:29.068 --> 17:33.614
He is not interested in Parisas body.

17:33.698 --> 17:40.079
It is her soul, he seeks.
He ​​called the white deeve.

17:40.162 --> 17:47.211
He is a dark wizard, who drink the innocent souls.

17:47.294 --> 17:50.631
If he steals the princess's soul...

17:51.715 --> 17:55.886
...it would be better,
if she had never been born.

17:55.969 --> 18:03.101
Where is this white deeve?
- On a large island called Macedonia.

18:04.478 --> 18:07.022
It is a gloomy place.

18:07.105 --> 18:11.484
The witch explained that I was the sultan's only hope

18:11.568 --> 18:18.408
and that I should travel to the
black desert within 40 days and nights.

18:41.555 --> 18:47.978
<i>As we sailed into the unknown, was
thoughts about the princess everything I had.</i>

19:36.942 --> 19:41.905
- Sinbad ship is almost ready.
- Is it?

19:45.492 --> 19:50.831
I can never be together.
Learn to accept it.

19:50.914 --> 19:55.710
None princess of Malek can love
an ordinary man. Such is the law.

20:02.425 --> 20:06.471
There he is again!
Every day at the same place...

20:06.554 --> 20:12.310
- ...staring like a hungry dog.
- I Think about how he looks at me.

20:12.393 --> 20:15.229
Guards, lower me down.

20:15.313 --> 20:19.942
Do not worry, Zohreh.
The guards will protect me.

20:20.026 --> 20:23.654
The guards are men.

20:23.738 --> 20:28.409
None of them protects your virtue, as I do, princess.

20:30.577 --> 20:36.416
From now on you must think of that you are a princess.

20:38.585 --> 20:43.048
If you are determined losing your head...

20:53.600 --> 20:55.852
Who is calling me?

20:55.935 --> 21:02.567
My eyes two watching the sea,
but on the beach he has an eye.

21:02.650 --> 21:06.696
Only with the heart that one can be free.

21:06.779 --> 21:09.866
"My eyes two watching the sea."

22:18.349 --> 22:22.394
My ship sank to the ocean floor.

22:29.985 --> 22:31.862
Binoculars.

23:58.362 --> 24:03.742
Is there anything on this island, are not gigantic?

24:11.291 --> 24:14.711
- In fools, I do not know what you do.
- We are starving.

24:14.795 --> 24:18.465
Hungry men do not ask.
Taking.

24:18.548 --> 24:21.218
Stop now. That's an order.

24:35.899 --> 24:39.694
Abdul, listen to me.
She protects only its eggs.

24:39.777 --> 24:42.405
Stand still.

24:45.658 --> 24:48.661
You're doing it. Stand just quiet.

24:57.336 --> 25:00.130
Back, back!

25:03.759 --> 25:06.303
We go back to the camp.

25:13.894 --> 25:18.148
Zohreh said that this country is prehistoric.

25:19.774 --> 25:24.654
We must be very careful future.

25:24.738 --> 25:29.325
- Why did you let us not kill the bird?
- It was not necessary.

25:29.409 --> 25:33.371
Not necessary?
It was by killing Abdul.

25:33.454 --> 25:36.207
Abdul still alive.

25:40.211 --> 25:46.550
The kind of thinking makes us
to the true monsters, not them.

25:48.594 --> 25:50.846
Yes, Captain.

26:07.571 --> 26:09.656
Parisa, where are you now?

26:12.617 --> 26:17.747
Alas, you dream of your loved Sinbad?

26:24.170 --> 26:26.422
Princess.

26:27.966 --> 26:31.719
Sinbad comes after me.
I have foreseen it.

26:35.473 --> 26:40.186
His ship now rests on the ocean floor...

26:43.022 --> 26:47.401
...and to swim to shore...

26:50.988 --> 26:52.823
...is suicide.

26:53.741 --> 26:58.537
- What do you want?
- It's not about what I want...

27:00.080 --> 27:04.459
...but what will happen.

27:04.543 --> 27:07.504
I show you...

27:08.672 --> 27:11.466
...what it means.

27:21.267 --> 27:23.102
No.

28:17.363 --> 28:19.991
Captain.

28:20.074 --> 28:25.037
- God be praised, something to drink!
- It appears to be honey.

28:46.558 --> 28:50.896
I would lift a bowl, but I have no water left.

28:50.979 --> 28:57.569
- This is an island. We will soon find water.
- Which island has an infinite desert?

28:57.652 --> 29:02.032
Where are the other shore?
Yes, where is it?

29:02.115 --> 29:06.119
Was your tongues, otherwise I crave death.

29:06.202 --> 29:09.539
This is an island.
We will find water.

29:09.622 --> 29:14.127
Then I will quench the thirst with this honey.

29:14.210 --> 29:17.880
Jamal, you do not know whether it is toxic.

29:17.964 --> 29:20.675
I'm sorry, Captain, but I...

29:43.655 --> 29:46.366
No one moves. Stand still.

29:55.875 --> 29:58.294
Running!

32:18.931 --> 32:22.142
How many weavers have been working on it?

32:22.226 --> 32:28.398
It took several years to make,
but see it now - completely destroyed.

32:28.482 --> 32:31.318
Why do we not stop to hide?

32:31.401 --> 32:37.949
Parisa, I'm not used to
navigate the sea in a woman's heart.

32:38.033 --> 32:44.414
Women are not so difficult to understand.
We want simple things.

32:44.497 --> 32:48.626
Also a princess puts devotion higher than jewels.

32:48.710 --> 32:54.966
A wink, a smile, a poem that praises her now and then.

32:58.135 --> 33:02.223
The bright moon reflected in your radiant face.

33:02.306 --> 33:08.062
Your snowy cheekbones provides water and grace.

33:08.145 --> 33:12.775
My heavy heart desires an audience with you.

33:14.276 --> 33:17.988
I appears.
I must return.

33:18.071 --> 33:22.075
Your command, I catch it.

33:47.809 --> 33:53.105
- I called Sinbad...
- I know who you are and what you want.

33:55.441 --> 33:57.610
Come in.

34:14.918 --> 34:17.379
- Firooz?
- Sinbad!

34:27.138 --> 34:33.103
- Captain, where did you go?
- I thought the monsters took you all...

34:33.186 --> 34:37.273
...But I see that the villagers
has treated you well.

34:37.357 --> 34:41.777
Yes, and they have also given us much food and drink.

34:41.860 --> 34:45.697
- Captain, let us drink.
- For life.

35:41.335 --> 35:44.338
Sinbad, Your Majesty.

35:46.257 --> 35:51.387
My spies told that you have
met my daughter behind my back.

35:53.597 --> 35:58.143
Your Majesty, I admit with a merry

35:58.227 --> 36:04.358
that I love Princess Parisa and makes
anything to marry her.

36:04.441 --> 36:08.403
Say what it takes, because I'm...

36:08.487 --> 36:13.074
Sinbad! I've heard about you.

36:13.158 --> 36:18.455
My daughter has told
that you have always treated her compensation

36:18.538 --> 36:22.667
and that her love is like yours.

36:24.460 --> 36:26.629
It may never happen.

36:26.713 --> 36:32.635
If you are a known man, then you are an ordinary man.

36:32.718 --> 36:35.846
Dad, I do not care.

36:35.930 --> 36:42.061
Your people would love you if you gave
your only daughter to one of them.

36:43.312 --> 36:47.733
What a terrible idea.

36:47.816 --> 36:52.863
You love this man today, but how do you think you sensor

36:52.946 --> 36:58.911
after a life of poverty, I give nothing.

37:00.203 --> 37:03.623
I would still love him!

37:03.707 --> 37:10.964
I offer you five times the value
of your catch and a fine vessel

37:11.047 --> 37:13.842
if you swear

37:13.925 --> 37:19.097
that you sail from here and never see my daughter again.

37:19.180 --> 37:22.725
With all due respect, You know what my answer is.

37:22.809 --> 37:27.647
Listen to me, Sinbad, I am a fair man.

37:27.730 --> 37:34.153
I offer you the opportunity to get your desire fulfilled.

37:34.236 --> 37:38.240
You can get married with my daughter today.

37:38.324 --> 37:44.038
But a minute after that I have been man and wife...

37:47.041 --> 37:50.043
- ...you will be beheaded.
- Daddy!

37:50.127 --> 37:53.380
You have never been so barbaric!

37:53.463 --> 37:57.300
How do you treat your daughter
and the man she loves, such?!

37:57.384 --> 38:00.345
Because I am the Sultan!

38:00.428 --> 38:05.141
This man desires not only you, Parisa.

38:05.225 --> 38:09.938
He also determines my whole kingdom fate.

38:10.021 --> 38:13.775
You are no ordinary girl.

38:13.858 --> 38:17.695
Your future would be entwined forever.

38:17.779 --> 38:24.660
If I lose you, I lose an heir of royal blood.

38:24.744 --> 38:28.664
So choose your fate, Sinbad!

38:35.296 --> 38:41.301
- Is there something wrong with the food?
- No, it's a beautiful sky.

38:41.385 --> 38:44.179
Is there something wrong with me?

38:44.263 --> 38:50.519
It is written that a man from the sea
must defeat all evil in this country.

38:51.895 --> 38:56.191
Most men think I'm irresistible.

38:57.442 --> 39:02.739
But you may have other wishes?

39:02.822 --> 39:06.409
Sinbad. Sinbad.

40:07.802 --> 40:10.721
Firooz you live!

40:12.348 --> 40:16.686
- I think...
- We solve it. You come with me.

40:16.769 --> 40:20.606
No, I have an idea. See.

40:23.984 --> 40:30.115
- I ask only wait with me.
- No! You follow me!

40:30.199 --> 40:34.620
No, Sinbad.
This is the only way.

41:31.883 --> 41:35.011
Poor Firooz.

41:35.095 --> 41:39.808
So it seems to amuse you

41:39.891 --> 41:43.520
when I show my sorcery power.

41:44.396 --> 41:48.691
As you know, I manipulate time.

41:55.406 --> 41:59.076
See your child.

42:00.203 --> 42:04.874
Yours and Sinbads.

42:07.793 --> 42:12.047
- How do I know it's real?
- Because...

42:12.131 --> 42:17.636
...The power of human emotions
generate tops...

42:19.012 --> 42:23.016
...in time and space.

42:29.314 --> 42:34.319
I have not knock to change them.

42:34.402 --> 42:36.279
Or...

42:38.281 --> 42:45.205
...to catch these peaks and use
them to travel through time.

42:46.664 --> 42:51.836
I am not strong enough, but soon it will change.

42:54.505 --> 42:57.550
But my Sinbad still alive.

42:59.969 --> 43:04.431
I wonder if you still feel that way...

43:06.809 --> 43:11.188
...after we have looked at your own destiny.

43:14.983 --> 43:16.902
It was sin.

43:20.697 --> 43:24.659
I see that you do not have any.

45:29.113 --> 45:32.450
- Sinbad?
- Firooz, you're alive?

45:34.035 --> 45:38.915
- An escaped soul?
- I know who you are.

45:38.998 --> 45:43.336
Then you know that you can not
play with me. Stand on the line!

45:48.007 --> 45:55.180
Are you living still?
Forget it. Just go to the page.

45:56.849 --> 46:04.106
Wait a minute. These are good people.
Why are they not in paradise?

46:04.189 --> 46:07.025
Their fates are not decided yet.

46:07.109 --> 46:11.696
But in the case they have not earned it here.

46:11.780 --> 46:18.078
There is cursed
these creatures. Also your men.

46:18.161 --> 46:23.666
We are condemned to wander of sand dunes in perpetuity.

46:25.293 --> 46:28.463
Forward march!

46:28.546 --> 46:30.465
Wait!

46:32.216 --> 46:37.763
- Are you interested in a bet?
- I have never been wanting.

46:37.847 --> 46:43.602
Soon you belong to me.
It makes you all the time.

46:46.647 --> 46:53.695
But you have things to do, and yet
you are trapped here as their watchdog.

46:53.779 --> 46:56.907
True, Sinbad.

46:58.533 --> 47:03.580
Killing is a natural part of the large sand

47:03.663 --> 47:07.292
over life and time.

47:07.375 --> 47:10.920
A curse is also part of the world.

47:11.004 --> 47:16.926
But taking a life on a
unnatural way and curse it

47:17.010 --> 47:21.014
creates a huge gap.

47:22.640 --> 47:25.518
Suppose I rate it here.

47:26.811 --> 47:31.899
If I find this white deeve and kills him...

47:33.150 --> 47:39.114
...so lets these souls
go free without any harm.

47:42.117 --> 47:45.287
And if you lose?

47:45.370 --> 47:51.126
If I lose, I take your place
and watching over them forever.

47:52.919 --> 47:55.839
You will definitely lose.

47:55.922 --> 48:00.802
But in any case I win.

48:00.886 --> 48:03.847
But mark you this, Sinbad--

48:03.930 --> 48:08.768
To be me is to suffer most of all.

48:08.852 --> 48:15.817
I have borne the weight of all losses
and all sorrow, since man came to.

48:15.900 --> 48:20.363
You will do it without end.

48:20.446 --> 48:23.824
If you drop.

48:25.034 --> 48:28.704
Are you still willing to to participate in this bet?

48:35.419 --> 48:37.171
Yes.

48:38.047 --> 48:39.715
Yes.

49:10.870 --> 49:17.501
- What are you?
- This picture paints a thousand words.

49:17.585 --> 49:22.256
- The one you don't need.
- You look like the Sultan.

49:22.339 --> 49:27.636
You see, what you will see.
Only what your brain will see.

49:27.720 --> 49:31.849
A spirit becomes a part of you, when it is freed.

49:31.932 --> 49:35.936
- A true spirit.
- Yes, to the service.

49:37.521 --> 49:41.566
Is it true that the spirits grant
three wishes when they are freed.

49:41.650 --> 49:48.865
It is said, but for five hundred years ago

49:48.949 --> 49:56.206
lured a treacherous and evil human me to go into lamps

49:56.289 --> 50:00.126
after he had gotten his wish.

50:00.210 --> 50:05.256
As that was not bad enough, he spent his final desired

50:05.339 --> 50:09.552
to use my powers to a felling

50:09.635 --> 50:13.723
for the unfortunate soul, which freed me.

50:13.806 --> 50:19.353
He said that my deliverer also could get three wishes

50:19.436 --> 50:24.233
but then he added a terrible condition.

50:24.316 --> 50:30.864
The man must die within the first sunset after my release.

50:30.948 --> 50:35.994
So what have you got to say now, Sinbad?

50:43.460 --> 50:46.421
So I will not ask anyone wants.

50:46.504 --> 50:51.759
I can not let you go without your three wishes, you know.

50:51.843 --> 50:55.597
One of them can not be to spare your life.

50:55.680 --> 51:02.603
I'm not looking forward to this.
When the day dawns, ending your life.

51:02.687 --> 51:06.816
Just to be sure...

51:06.899 --> 51:11.529
Not a single request can spare me this despair?

51:11.612 --> 51:16.283
Correct. A desire can not save you.
It makes me very sore.

51:16.367 --> 51:23.540
But the spirit must obey his liberator.
So, make your wishes now, Sinbad.

51:25.125 --> 51:31.506
My first wish is that you spares me for this despair.

51:33.759 --> 51:37.179
I thought I had explained it to you.

51:37.262 --> 51:43.101
One of your wishes
can not spare you. What a waste!

51:43.184 --> 51:47.438
Now there are only two wishes left.

51:50.984 --> 51:56.239
My second wish is to be close to Parisa.

52:04.789 --> 52:09.460
See the power that you testify.

52:15.341 --> 52:19.928
See the power that you testify.

52:21.722 --> 52:26.351
- And Parisa?
- Yes, behind these doors.

52:26.435 --> 52:32.190
I can only take you to deeves cave.

52:32.941 --> 52:38.988
But what role does it play?
You must nonetheless soon say goodbye.

52:39.072 --> 52:44.535
Yes, of course.
My third and last wish is...

52:47.038 --> 52:50.833
...that you spare me
of this despair.

52:50.917 --> 52:54.962
You must now observe the consequences of...

52:57.214 --> 53:02.261
Excuse me a moment.
It's a bit confusing.

53:02.344 --> 53:07.224
It takes just a moment, Sinbad.
Thank you.

53:07.308 --> 53:11.395
Three wishes for five hundred years.
Minus one, minus one...

53:11.478 --> 53:17.109
It might not be the entire desired.
One moment, Sinbad.

53:18.235 --> 53:25.200
You need not be so confused.
A claim could not spare me.

53:25.283 --> 53:29.704
- Continue...
- You did not say that more people want...

53:29.788 --> 53:33.166
...could not save me
from certain destruction.

53:35.960 --> 53:39.881
Do struggling contend if you do not have the right!

53:41.424 --> 53:44.927
Your will is my law.

53:48.848 --> 53:54.311
Thank you, Sinbad. You have freed me
from another prison.

53:55.479 --> 54:01.443
My time here is almost over, but before I say goodbye...

54:01.527 --> 54:06.156
- ...barging, undesired you do it here?
- No.

54:07.616 --> 54:13.330
But there is no book, which says that gifts are bad.

54:21.254 --> 54:22.923
What should I...

55:08.467 --> 55:13.263
The white deeve was a powerful force.

55:13.346 --> 55:17.350
Armies could not escape its grip.

56:36.469 --> 56:39.346
I want kill you again.

58:29.787 --> 58:34.500
Yes, yes, yes... Sinbad...

58:35.834 --> 58:40.923
You seem to to have more lives than a cat.

58:41.757 --> 58:44.009
Where is Parisa?

59:04.445 --> 59:09.492
Before chipper you should look around.

59:12.245 --> 59:16.874
I can free the beast with a single motion.

59:21.545 --> 59:26.800
- Sinbad, is it really you?
- Everything is good.

59:29.053 --> 59:34.308
- Release her!
- You're not in a position to make demands.

59:34.391 --> 59:39.062
- What do you want?
- It's not what I want...

59:39.146 --> 59:42.774
...but what will happen.

59:42.858 --> 59:48.863
A long time ago, I asked a spirit grant my desired

59:48.947 --> 59:55.411
about unlimited power, but the spirit tricked me.

59:55.495 --> 01:00:01.334
My power is limited to this island.

01:00:01.417 --> 01:00:06.589
However, this is changing.

01:00:07.882 --> 01:00:13.304
A new day dawns and leads a storm with
itself, which spans the entire world.

01:00:13.387 --> 01:00:20.436
A powerful soul as your
generates feelings for your beloved

01:00:20.519 --> 01:00:26.024
and becomes the catalyst
which makes my magic thousandfold stronger!

01:00:26.108 --> 01:00:30.320
Do you understand it, Sinbad?

01:00:30.404 --> 01:00:35.367
You're the last ingredient in this drink.

01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:39.454
Was Parisa the bait that led me here?

01:00:39.538 --> 01:00:44.334
You threatened the woman I love.
My crew is gone.

01:00:44.417 --> 01:00:48.922
Firooz which was as a sister death.

01:00:49.005 --> 01:00:55.595
I know you see me as embodied evil.

01:00:55.678 --> 01:01:02.226
Or am I part of the balance sheet as nature intended.

01:01:02.310 --> 01:01:06.731
- It's not too late to stop this.
- Make!

01:01:06.814 --> 01:01:10.901
You only have one chance now.

01:01:10.985 --> 01:01:15.906
Give me your soul,
otherwise I get rid of this beast freedoms

01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:20.953
which completes your life here and now.

01:01:36.259 --> 01:01:39.137
- It accepts me.
- No!

01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:49.188
- What will happen to him?
- He can go with me...

01:01:49.272 --> 01:01:53.860
...or be my humble servant.

01:01:55.319 --> 01:01:58.447
It's his choice.

01:02:02.118 --> 01:02:08.874
I have two conditions.
Parisa go free now.

01:02:08.958 --> 01:02:14.421
And the city, Malek, must have peace.

01:02:14.505 --> 01:02:21.386
Only then I promise you my soul, and maybe I go with you.

01:02:23.305 --> 01:02:26.308
You have my word.

01:02:26.391 --> 01:02:30.478
Let's get it over with.

01:02:32.272 --> 01:02:36.651
Take this and wear it around your neck.

01:02:36.735 --> 01:02:42.991
And put your sword.

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:21.611
Why are you hesitating? Choose now.

01:03:21.695 --> 01:03:26.241
Wealth, a ship and your life.

01:03:26.324 --> 01:03:32.455
Or... one "kneel wedding".

01:03:41.714 --> 01:03:45.801
- The choice is easy, your Majesty.
- The force!

01:03:45.885 --> 01:03:52.850
I might as well be trully dead
rather than living an empty life without her.

01:04:09.116 --> 01:04:13.078
I do not get wiped out!

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:55.494
There was another woman in your life that you loved.

01:04:55.577 --> 01:04:58.580
Your mother!

01:06:50.856 --> 01:06:53.817
Hurry to the balloon!

01:08:19.899 --> 01:08:23.612
Again evil unable to defeat it

01:08:23.696 --> 01:08:29.285
has always been the true ultimate power.

01:08:29.368 --> 01:08:32.997
Power in a motivated heart.
