00:01.119 --> 00:02.518
<i>Well, that party was a dud.</i>

00:02.520 --> 00:04.440
<i>I think I struck out</i>
<i>with, like, 20 girls.</i>

00:04.855 --> 00:06.872
And...
my condom expired.

00:06.874 --> 00:07.989
We are losers!

00:07.991 --> 00:09.625
We've tried everything.

00:09.627 --> 00:11.176
We're covered
in Drakkar,

00:11.178 --> 00:12.494
I've got fresh
new white socks,

00:12.496 --> 00:14.179
and I thought our
mime work in there

00:14.181 --> 00:16.215
was excellent!

00:16.216 --> 00:17.382
What?

00:22.806 --> 00:26.725
Um, are we in a zombie
movie right now?

Boys...

00:52.887 --> 00:55.704
today is your lucky day.

00:55.706 --> 00:58.206
Because today...

00:58.208 --> 01:01.093
I'm gonna teach you
how to...

01:04.980 --> 01:06.598
...live.

01:21.197 --> 01:24.232
<i>Kids, for a brief period</i>
<i>when I was seven,</i>

01:24.234 --> 01:26.735
<i>my best friend was a balloon.</i>

01:26.737 --> 01:28.203
<i>It was the classic story:</i>

01:28.205 --> 01:30.205
<i>boy meets balloon,</i>

01:30.207 --> 01:32.157
boy and balloon become friends,

01:32.159 --> 01:33.425
<i>boy loses balloon</i>

01:33.427 --> 01:35.210
<i>when Mom sets out hot dogs</i>
<i>in the backyard.</i>

01:35.212 --> 01:38.380
No!

01:38.382 --> 01:40.415
<i>Decades later, boy's new</i>
<i>best friend finds out</i>

01:40.417 --> 01:42.718
about the whole thing and never
<i>lets him live it down.</i>

01:42.720 --> 01:44.219
I hate you so much.

01:44.221 --> 01:45.771
<i>The whole thing</i>
<i>taught me a lesson.</i>

01:45.773 --> 01:47.039
<i>If you love something,</i>

01:47.041 --> 01:48.407
<i>you can never let it go,</i>

01:48.409 --> 01:50.108
<i>not even for a second,</i>

01:50.110 --> 01:51.276
<i>or it's gone forever.</i>

01:51.278 --> 01:54.479
Well, at least
I still got my hot dogs.

01:55.899 --> 01:57.382
No!

01:57.384 --> 01:59.117
<i>It was a lesson that took me</i>

01:59.119 --> 02:00.869
<i>nearly 30 years to unlearn.</i>

02:00.871 --> 02:02.604
Where could Barney be?

02:02.606 --> 02:04.406
Oh, relax.
He always finds his way home.

02:04.408 --> 02:06.542
St. Patrick's
Day, 2008.

02:06.544 --> 02:08.276
He did not find his
way home that night.

02:08.277 --> 02:10.329
That Dumpster was
a block from his apartment.

02:10.330 --> 02:11.914
I call that a win.

02:11.916 --> 02:14.333
Also, that isn't the filthiest trash
he's ever slept with.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.635
Ho! My future
husband, folks!

02:18.639 --> 02:20.339
Or maybe he bailed
on the wedding.

02:20.341 --> 02:21.289
Oh, come on.

02:21.291 --> 02:22.474
Don't even
think like that.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.893
Well, he's terrified
of commitment--

02:24.895 --> 02:27.930
although, ironically,
loves being tied down...

02:27.932 --> 02:31.683
Look, as the run-offee
at my own almost-wedding,

02:31.685 --> 02:33.485
I can tell you
you are fine.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.687
Barney is no Stella.
Mmm.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.138
Hey, have you talked
to her in a while?

02:37.140 --> 02:39.107
Stella?
Yeah.

02:39.109 --> 02:40.976
The woman who
broke my heart

02:40.978 --> 02:42.310
and embarrassed me
in front of

02:42.312 --> 02:44.029
all my friends
and loved ones?

02:44.031 --> 02:45.697
Uh... no.

02:45.699 --> 02:47.082
<i>That was a lie.</i>

02:47.084 --> 02:48.166
<i>A few days earlier,</i>

02:48.168 --> 02:49.968
<i>I had talked</i>
<i>to Stella on the phone.</i>

02:49.970 --> 02:51.753
Because, as you may recall,

02:51.755 --> 02:54.790
I'm kind of
the wedding gift master.

02:54.792 --> 02:56.041
Okay, I'm gonna stop you.

02:56.043 --> 02:57.042
Do you not hear

02:57.044 --> 02:58.377
how weird this all sounds?

02:58.379 --> 02:59.511
What part of this is weird?

02:59.513 --> 03:00.879
You're going to your
ex-girlfriend's wedding.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.831
It's not weird at all.
Where you'll be the best man...

03:02.833 --> 03:03.966
Utterly not weird.

03:03.968 --> 03:05.851
And now, less than
a week before the wedding,

03:05.853 --> 03:08.103
you're calling the woman
who left you at the altar

03:08.105 --> 03:10.188
and moved three time zones away

03:10.190 --> 03:11.640
on the razor-thin chance

03:11.642 --> 03:12.774
that I somehow ended up

03:12.776 --> 03:14.643
with her grandmother's locket?

03:14.645 --> 03:15.644
You know what's weird, Stella?

03:15.646 --> 03:16.812
Not seeing <i>Star Wars</i>

03:16.814 --> 03:17.846
until you're 30.

03:17.848 --> 03:19.364
You're trying
to blow up the wedding.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.566
You called C-3PO "the Tin Man."

03:21.568 --> 03:22.701
He is made of tin!

03:22.703 --> 03:24.352
It's Tatooine scrap metal!

03:24.354 --> 03:26.705
This is not an argument
you are gonna win.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.357
Now, do you have
the locket or not?

03:28.359 --> 03:30.709
Look, I might have it somewhere

03:30.711 --> 03:32.577
in one of my old boxes
in our storage locker,

03:32.579 --> 03:35.080
but even if I did, I cannot get
out there this week.

03:35.082 --> 03:36.715
I'm totally swamped.

03:37.867 --> 03:40.118
One ticket to Los Angeles,
please.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.537
<i>So the reason someone</i>
<i>can't come up</i>

03:42.539 --> 03:43.805
to fix the air conditioning

03:43.807 --> 03:46.341
is that the ghost
of Captain Dearduff,

03:46.343 --> 03:48.043
who haunts this room,

03:48.045 --> 03:49.378
likes it muggy?

03:49.380 --> 03:50.479
That's correct.

03:50.481 --> 03:51.813
Although, now that
I say it out loud,

03:51.815 --> 03:53.849
it does sound
kind of ridiculous,

03:53.851 --> 03:55.350
because there's
no such thing as ghosts.

03:55.352 --> 03:56.685
Right?

03:58.271 --> 04:00.155
You have outflanked me,
Front Desk Guy!

04:00.157 --> 04:02.574
Victory is yours!

04:02.576 --> 04:05.577
<i>The truth is, there was</i>
<i>a ghost in that room.</i>

04:05.579 --> 04:07.195
<i>You see, minutes earlier,</i>

04:07.197 --> 04:09.197
Marshall had been in the middle
<i>of the worst fight</i>

04:09.199 --> 04:10.415
<i>of his marriage,</i>

04:10.417 --> 04:12.901
<i>when all of sudden,</i>
<i>Lily stormed out.</i>

04:13.736 --> 04:16.254
Damn it, Lily.

04:16.255 --> 04:17.622
This is so unfair.

04:17.624 --> 04:18.906
I know!

04:18.909 --> 04:21.076
Storming out in
the middle of an argument?

04:21.077 --> 04:22.794
So childish!

04:22.796 --> 04:24.913
Thank you,
Ghost Lily.

04:24.915 --> 04:27.215
I'm glad at least
you see it that way.

04:27.217 --> 04:30.085
Although, let's be honest,
I did you a favor.

04:30.087 --> 04:31.252
You were gonna lose.

04:31.254 --> 04:32.721
I... what?

04:32.723 --> 04:33.889
I was gonna lose?

04:33.891 --> 04:36.224
Uh, check your spectral
scorecard, Ghost Lily.

04:36.226 --> 04:37.392
I had you on the ropes.

04:37.394 --> 04:38.560
That's why you ran out.

04:38.562 --> 04:41.163
I ran out because
you brought up San Francisco.

04:41.165 --> 04:42.481
It was a valid point.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.265
It's ancient history.

04:44.267 --> 04:45.934
If you're mad at anyone,

04:45.936 --> 04:47.536
you're mad at 2006 Lily.

04:47.538 --> 04:49.571
Well, I can't very well
have an argument with 2006...

04:49.573 --> 04:51.456
Is nice!

04:51.458 --> 04:53.375
Do people still say that?

04:54.243 --> 04:55.994
I'm sorry,
how exactly

04:55.996 --> 04:57.879
are you gonna
teach us how to live?

04:57.881 --> 05:00.248
The journey to awesome

05:00.250 --> 05:02.417
starts with a single...

05:03.753 --> 05:04.920
Actually, lots of singles.

05:04.922 --> 05:05.954
We're going to a strip club.

05:05.956 --> 05:07.222
Strip club?

05:07.224 --> 05:09.257
We're in the middle
of nowhere.

05:09.259 --> 05:11.176
There is always
a strip club.

05:12.595 --> 05:15.097
Hey, are you a little worried
this guy might kill us?

05:15.099 --> 05:18.133
We just put a down payment
on adult bunk beds.

05:18.135 --> 05:20.318
Would getting killed
really be so bad?

05:20.320 --> 05:22.320
Good point.
I got a weird feeling.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.822
I mean, there's
something off about...

05:23.824 --> 05:25.440
Whoa!

05:29.313 --> 05:31.997
why does this sign
say "gentlemen's club"?

05:31.999 --> 05:34.833
Answer: because The Crab Shed

05:34.835 --> 05:37.035
is a place for gentlemen.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.336
A gentleman

05:38.338 --> 05:40.038
tips generously.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.423
A gentleman uses

05:41.425 --> 05:43.792
the complimentary
bathroom cologne...

05:43.794 --> 05:44.993
...but not too much.

05:44.995 --> 05:47.496
Oh. This is
important.

05:47.498 --> 05:49.931
Your instinct may be

05:49.933 --> 05:52.851
to avoid the free buffet.

05:52.853 --> 05:56.171
Your instinct is wrong.

05:56.173 --> 05:58.440
Don't sleep on the meatballs,
gentlemen.

05:58.442 --> 05:59.775
They are

05:59.777 --> 06:00.859
exquisite!

06:00.861 --> 06:03.195
Come on!

06:05.481 --> 06:07.399
You know,
I liked Stella.

06:07.401 --> 06:08.850
Even though she
broke your heart,

06:08.852 --> 06:10.735
I'd still put her
in your top five.

06:10.737 --> 06:12.070
Which are...?

06:12.072 --> 06:13.789
All right, number five, Stella.
Mm-hmm.

06:13.791 --> 06:15.073
Number four,
Zoey.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.242
Number three, uh,
the Slutty Pumpkin.

06:17.244 --> 06:18.243
Ah.

06:18.245 --> 06:19.360
Number two,
Marshall,

06:19.362 --> 06:21.129
that time you guys
pretended to be a couple

06:21.131 --> 06:22.631
when Barney was trying
to sell the apartment.

06:23.667 --> 06:25.917
And number one,
Victoria.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.719
Well, you've given
this some thought.

06:27.721 --> 06:28.887
Well, we all have.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.922
There's kind of a running
e-mail chain about it.

06:30.924 --> 06:33.541
But the pastry chef
was the best.

06:33.543 --> 06:34.726
No question.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.678
I do miss her
sticky buns.

06:36.680 --> 06:37.679
Uh, euphemism?

06:37.681 --> 06:40.765
Nope.

06:40.767 --> 06:41.933
Can I be honest?

06:41.935 --> 06:45.103
Um, it was kind of crazy
how all of sudden

06:45.105 --> 06:48.940
it was just... over
between you and Victoria.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.026
I mean...

06:51.028 --> 06:53.862
you guys were seven
years in the making.

06:53.864 --> 06:56.364
She left her fiancé
for you.

06:56.366 --> 06:57.916
What... why would
you break up?

07:00.119 --> 07:01.786
What happened?

07:05.242 --> 07:08.176
We, um...

07:08.178 --> 07:10.411
we broke up because of you.

07:14.733 --> 07:16.534
Oh, my God,
this is amazing!

07:17.033 --> 07:19.484
I ruined my pants, but
it's totally worth it!

07:19.486 --> 07:21.486
Best meatballs ever!

07:21.488 --> 07:23.437
Mmm!
I'm gonna ask

07:23.439 --> 07:24.572
a serious question
right now.

07:24.574 --> 07:27.074
Can a person live
in a strip club?

07:27.076 --> 07:28.876
Yes.

07:28.878 --> 07:29.961
For the next few years,

07:29.963 --> 07:31.712
your strip club
will be like home.

07:31.714 --> 07:33.915
Then, one day,
you'll date a stripper

07:33.917 --> 07:36.467
and almost marry her,
and after that,

07:36.469 --> 07:38.836
you'll realize
you're done with strip clubs.

07:38.838 --> 07:41.973
In the sense that you'll dial it
back to, like, once a week.

07:41.975 --> 07:44.242
I feel like I can talk to women now.
Yeah.

07:44.244 --> 07:45.877
You just stick
a dollar bill in your mouth,

07:45.879 --> 07:47.461
and the conversation
starts itself.

07:47.463 --> 07:49.380
You know, I think we're ready
to go back to that party

07:49.382 --> 07:50.648
and meet some ladies.

07:50.650 --> 07:52.250
Yeah!

07:52.252 --> 07:53.818
Yeah!
Yeah!

07:53.820 --> 07:57.154
You! Are!
Not! Ready!

07:57.156 --> 07:58.940
Your training is complete

07:58.942 --> 08:02.693
when I say
your training is complete!

08:02.695 --> 08:03.861
Come on, let's go.

08:05.981 --> 08:08.366
You-you broke up with Victoria

08:08.368 --> 08:09.650
because of me?

08:09.652 --> 08:12.920
She didn't want us
to be friends anymore,

08:12.922 --> 08:14.505
so I had to let her go.

08:14.507 --> 08:16.707
Ted...

08:19.127 --> 08:21.879
I just...

08:21.881 --> 08:23.714
Wow, I...

08:23.716 --> 08:25.383
And-and you haven't
talked to her since?

08:25.385 --> 08:27.301
Haven't talked to her since.

08:27.303 --> 08:29.020
<i>Also a lie.</i>

08:29.022 --> 08:30.438
Unbelievable.

08:30.440 --> 08:32.306
And I assume this is
all in the hopes

08:32.308 --> 08:33.857
that Robin'll ditch
her own wedding

08:33.860 --> 08:35.025
and run off with you?

08:35.028 --> 08:36.811
What? No.

08:36.813 --> 08:37.812
I would never.

08:37.813 --> 08:38.863
You would never
run off with a girl

08:38.865 --> 08:39.897
on the day of her wedding?

08:39.899 --> 08:41.164
Ri...

08:41.167 --> 08:42.400
Okay, that's a fair point.

08:42.402 --> 08:43.484
I'm not done.

08:43.486 --> 08:45.152
...ight.

08:45.154 --> 08:46.604
So, do you have it?

08:50.709 --> 08:52.243
I'm looking at it right now.

08:52.245 --> 08:53.628
What?
Oh, uh... stay there.

08:53.630 --> 08:54.662
I'm-I'm on my way.

08:54.664 --> 08:55.713
I'm in Germany.

08:55.715 --> 08:56.914
<i>Danke schon!</i>

08:58.366 --> 08:59.333
I see.

08:59.335 --> 09:01.002
Look, if it means
that much to you,

09:01.004 --> 09:02.637
as soon as I'm done
here at the bakery,

09:02.639 --> 09:03.671
I'll overnight it.

09:03.673 --> 09:05.022
It'll be there in 24 hours.

09:06.042 --> 09:07.508
Thank you.

09:07.510 --> 09:09.427
So this bakery,
what kind of, uh...

09:09.429 --> 09:10.428
You want me to send you

09:10.430 --> 09:11.729
some chocolate truffle
streuselkuchen?

09:11.731 --> 09:13.648
Yes, please,
you're the best, thank you.

09:13.650 --> 09:15.733
<i>But then, 24 hours later...</i>

09:15.735 --> 09:16.934
<i>disaster.</i>

09:16.936 --> 09:18.352
I'm sorry, Mr. Mosby.

09:18.354 --> 09:21.155
It says here your package
was delivered earlier today.

09:21.157 --> 09:22.406
Your wife signed for it.

09:22.408 --> 09:23.741
My... what?

09:23.743 --> 09:24.892
I... I don't have a wife.

09:24.894 --> 09:27.411
So, then, who's Jeanette Mosby?

09:27.413 --> 09:29.780
Oh, you're kidding me.

09:31.817 --> 09:34.752
Oh, my gosh,
2013 me!

09:34.754 --> 09:36.203
So many questions!

09:36.205 --> 09:38.623
How many MySpace friends
do I have now?

09:38.625 --> 09:40.808
Has James Blunt
put out

09:40.810 --> 09:42.743
the steady stream
of number one hits

09:42.745 --> 09:44.011
we all expect from him?

09:44.013 --> 09:46.430
And why are we in
this hotel room?

09:46.432 --> 09:47.965
We're here for Barney's wedding.

09:47.967 --> 09:49.433
<i>Barney's</i> wedding?

09:49.435 --> 09:50.635
Oh, God.

09:50.637 --> 09:52.103
What desperate ho-bag

09:52.105 --> 09:54.271
is handcuffing herself
to that time bomb?

09:54.273 --> 09:56.590
My dad did a real
number on me.

09:56.592 --> 09:58.976
Okay, uh... Ghost Lily,
seven-years-ago Ghost Lily,

09:58.978 --> 10:00.111
can we get on with this

10:00.113 --> 10:01.445
so I can win the argument

10:01.447 --> 10:02.930
and we can move on to my
regularly scheduled fantasy

10:02.932 --> 10:04.198
of you two making out
with each other?

10:04.200 --> 10:05.533
Sure.
Just so you know,

10:05.535 --> 10:07.151
I really like it when...

10:07.153 --> 10:08.536
I know.
I'm you.

10:08.538 --> 10:11.105
And I don't like
that anymore.

10:11.107 --> 10:11.989
Okay, yes,

10:11.991 --> 10:13.541
seven-years-ago Lily,

10:13.543 --> 10:15.660
maybe I am wrong
for still being mad at you

10:15.662 --> 10:19.046
about San Francisco
and our breakup.

10:19.048 --> 10:21.499
But the truth is,
when you left me,

10:21.501 --> 10:23.868
that was the saddest
I've ever been in my life.

10:23.870 --> 10:24.952
Really?

10:24.954 --> 10:26.671
The saddest you've
ever been in your life?

10:26.673 --> 10:27.722
Saddest I've ever been
in my life.

10:27.724 --> 10:30.007
I mean, I am
sitting right here.

10:30.009 --> 10:33.144
Look, Dad, yes, obviously,
losing you was way worse,

10:33.146 --> 10:36.380
but I'm trying to make
a bigger point here.

10:36.382 --> 10:37.648
And what point is that?

10:37.650 --> 10:40.885
Because she hurt you once,
you now get to hurt her?

10:40.887 --> 10:42.687
It's not how it works
in a marriage.

10:42.689 --> 10:43.604
Ooh...

10:43.606 --> 10:46.340
You're totally gonna lose.

10:47.659 --> 10:50.444
I can't believe
you're open at this hour.

10:50.446 --> 10:52.146
I'm always open
for my friends.

10:52.148 --> 10:53.247
What are we doing here?

10:53.249 --> 10:54.665
We should go back
to the party.

10:54.667 --> 10:57.001
In relaxed-fit domestic denim?

10:57.003 --> 10:58.819
I'm sorry,
is this a costume party,

10:58.821 --> 11:00.621
and you're going as 1994?

11:00.623 --> 11:02.923
Would you be a peach
and bump this, please?

11:04.176 --> 11:05.659
Who cares
about any of this?

11:05.661 --> 11:06.677
They're just clothes.

11:06.679 --> 11:09.329
Just clothes? Ted--

11:09.331 --> 11:11.665
sorry, force of habit--

11:11.667 --> 11:13.217
boys, suits are cool.

11:13.219 --> 11:14.518
Exhibit A.

11:14.520 --> 11:16.003
I don't care
how well-dressed I am.

11:16.005 --> 11:17.888
The real challenge is walking
up to a girl

11:17.890 --> 11:19.173
that I've never met before

11:19.175 --> 11:22.843
and somehow talking to her
with words from my mouth.

11:22.845 --> 11:24.645
I've looked at it
from every possible angle.

11:24.647 --> 11:26.230
There's just no way to do it.

11:32.237 --> 11:33.537
What's your name?

11:33.539 --> 11:34.789
Justin.

11:34.791 --> 11:36.857
Have you met Justin?

11:36.859 --> 11:39.460
Uh, no. Hi, I'm Julie.

11:39.462 --> 11:41.712
So simple, so elegant.

11:41.714 --> 11:42.997
Hmm.
That's it?

11:42.999 --> 11:44.882
You just walk up to someone
you don't know

11:44.884 --> 11:46.250
and introduce them
to your buddy?

11:46.252 --> 11:47.551
I don't know.
That sounds kind of...

11:47.553 --> 11:48.919
Have you met Kyle?

11:48.921 --> 11:50.254
Hi, Kyle.

11:50.256 --> 11:52.206
Are you Jesus?!

11:53.141 --> 11:55.392
I would have understood,

11:55.394 --> 11:56.977
you know?

11:56.979 --> 11:58.345
I mean, if you told me

11:58.347 --> 12:00.397
that we couldn't be friends
anymore,

12:00.399 --> 12:01.816
I-I wouldn't have liked it,

12:01.818 --> 12:03.601
but I, God,
I would have understood.

12:03.603 --> 12:05.102
I could never do that.

12:05.104 --> 12:06.203
Why not?

12:07.856 --> 12:10.391
Ted, okay, I insist
that you tell me why not.

12:10.393 --> 12:11.558
No way.

12:11.560 --> 12:14.278
Answer the question.
It's... it's for the bride.

12:14.280 --> 12:15.696
I'm not gonna answer
the question,

12:15.698 --> 12:18.916
because you know the answer.

12:19.868 --> 12:21.702
You want to talk
about my top five?

12:21.704 --> 12:23.070
There's no top five, Robin!

12:23.072 --> 12:25.539
There's just a top one,
and it's you.

12:25.541 --> 12:29.009
And the only reason I'm saying
any of this is 'cause

12:29.011 --> 12:31.879
I know that it's not gonna
change anything.

12:31.881 --> 12:33.931
You and Barney are getting
married today.

12:33.933 --> 12:36.801
If I have to hold the shotgun
myself, it's happening.

12:36.803 --> 12:39.470
I thought you don't like guns.

12:39.472 --> 12:40.971
I'm the best man.

12:40.973 --> 12:43.607
I swore on the Bro Code.

12:43.609 --> 12:46.610
I don't want to go to Bro Hell.

12:46.612 --> 12:47.895
Bro Hell sounds bad.

12:47.897 --> 12:50.197
I'm sure Barney's got
a whole thing about Bro Hell.

12:50.199 --> 12:56.036
But what about when we
get back from our honeymoon?

12:56.955 --> 12:58.605
What about our first night out
at the bar?

12:58.607 --> 12:59.606
But what then?

12:59.608 --> 13:01.709
I mean, is it gonna be weird?

13:01.711 --> 13:03.294
No.

13:03.296 --> 13:05.162
How can you be so sure?

13:05.164 --> 13:07.464
Because I'm not gonna be there.

13:07.466 --> 13:09.550
I'm moving to Chicago.

13:13.487 --> 13:15.571
You're moving to Chicago?
That's right.

13:15.573 --> 13:17.073
I'm gonna work
for Hammond Druthers.

13:17.075 --> 13:18.541
The penis-building guy?

13:18.620 --> 13:20.370
They're not all penis buildings.

13:20.372 --> 13:22.405
They just designed
this clamshell amphitheater

13:22.407 --> 13:23.706
for the St. Louis Symphony.

13:23.708 --> 13:27.560
That one, it doesn't look
like a penis, anyway.

13:27.562 --> 13:30.546
I can't believe
you're leaving New York.

13:31.432 --> 13:33.700
Wait, is this be--
is this because of me?

13:33.702 --> 13:35.918
No, it's not because of you.

13:35.920 --> 13:38.587
Well, maybe at first
it was, but...

13:50.951 --> 13:53.436
It's been a really long week.

13:53.438 --> 13:57.991
Some stuff has happened and...

13:57.993 --> 14:01.961
it's just made me feel like
it's, it's time to move on.

14:03.163 --> 14:05.614
Yes, good things happened
to me in New York,

14:05.616 --> 14:09.085
but bad things happened, too.

14:09.087 --> 14:12.905
Like your top five
worst relationships?

14:12.907 --> 14:16.959
Okay, come on. Let me hear it.

14:16.961 --> 14:18.895
Number five, Blah Blah.
Mm-hmm.

14:18.897 --> 14:21.898
Number four,
boats, boats, boats.

14:21.900 --> 14:23.483
Number three, Karen.
Mm.

14:23.485 --> 14:27.803
Number two, uh, Zoey.
She made both lists.

14:27.805 --> 14:31.274
Number one, by a landslide,
Jeanette.

14:31.276 --> 14:33.409
Jeanette, of course.
By the way,

14:33.411 --> 14:34.610
have you talked
to Jeanette lately?

14:34.612 --> 14:36.579
- I haven't talked to her.
<i>- Liar.</i>

14:36.581 --> 14:39.482
So I was at your apartment
stealing your mail,

14:39.484 --> 14:42.935
and apparently there's
some chick named Victoria

14:42.937 --> 14:44.487
sending you jewelry

14:44.489 --> 14:45.722
from Germany?

14:45.724 --> 14:48.374
Somebody owes somebody
an explanation.

14:48.376 --> 14:50.727
Jeanette, that locket
is a wedding gift for Robin.

14:50.729 --> 14:53.246
Robin?! Oh, God, this again?

14:53.248 --> 14:55.631
That I'm giving
to her as a friend

14:55.633 --> 14:57.433
because I'm kind
of the wedding gift master!

14:57.435 --> 14:59.168
Now bring it back
to me right now!

14:59.170 --> 15:01.270
Fine. Meet me
at the Bow Bridge

15:01.272 --> 15:03.022
in Central Park in one hour.

15:03.024 --> 15:05.625
And by the way,
I want Kenny back.

15:05.627 --> 15:06.442
Who's Kenny?!

15:06.444 --> 15:08.027
My pet tarantula.

15:09.364 --> 15:11.614
By the way, I love your hair.

15:11.616 --> 15:13.082
I love <i>your</i> hair!

15:13.084 --> 15:14.283
Imaginary women, right?

15:14.285 --> 15:18.354
I need everyone
to just be quiet, please.

15:18.356 --> 15:23.609
Look, I know that I could
have handled all of this better.

15:23.611 --> 15:26.546
But setting aside the fact
that all of our friends are here

15:26.548 --> 15:28.131
and that we don't speak Italian,

15:28.133 --> 15:30.833
if we stay in New York, we both
get to follow our dreams.

15:30.835 --> 15:32.035
Are we really gonna go someplace

15:32.037 --> 15:33.920
where only one of us gets
to do that?

15:33.922 --> 15:35.704
Of course not.
Well, then how can you...?

15:35.706 --> 15:37.256
Wait-- what?

15:37.258 --> 15:39.041
We're not moving to Italy.

15:39.043 --> 15:41.511
We have a baby.
It makes sense to stay here.

15:41.513 --> 15:42.595
Even I know that.

15:42.597 --> 15:44.347
You do?

15:44.349 --> 15:47.100
So... I win?

15:47.935 --> 15:50.787
Well, then, ho, hey, ho.

15:50.789 --> 15:54.857
In your ethereal face,
Ghost Lily.

15:54.859 --> 15:58.194
Oh, yeah, the Convincer
right here!

15:58.196 --> 15:59.529
She thought I was gonna lose.

15:59.531 --> 16:00.913
You <i>are</i> gonna lose.

16:00.915 --> 16:04.567
You're gonna lose this.

16:04.569 --> 16:06.002
If you keep lying to me,

16:06.004 --> 16:08.004
if you keep cutting me out
of decisions,

16:08.006 --> 16:11.791
if you keep using words
like "winning" and "losing"

16:11.793 --> 16:13.543
when you talk
about our marriage.

16:13.545 --> 16:16.462
It's not like it'll happen
all at once,

16:16.464 --> 16:19.265
but if you keep acting
this way,

16:19.267 --> 16:22.435
little by little,

16:22.437 --> 16:23.736
you're gonna lose me.

16:23.738 --> 16:26.405
Is that what you want?

16:26.407 --> 16:28.641
No, of course not.

16:28.643 --> 16:32.562
You're not my enemy.
You're my wife.

16:32.564 --> 16:33.429
My wife!

16:33.431 --> 16:34.714
Right?

16:34.716 --> 16:36.616
No. Sorr... sorry.

16:37.785 --> 16:40.336
We should
probably head back.

16:41.438 --> 16:44.123
Do you want to watch
the sun come up?

16:47.494 --> 16:48.777
Sure.

16:48.779 --> 16:51.030
<i>Thanks for meeting me here.</i>

16:51.032 --> 16:53.782
I'm heading over to the East
Side to stuff a dead squirrel

16:53.784 --> 16:55.585
into a different
ex-boyfriend's mailbox,

16:55.587 --> 16:57.587
so, you know, this made sense.

16:57.589 --> 16:58.954
Of course.

16:58.956 --> 17:00.923
So, can I have the locket?

17:00.925 --> 17:02.809
No.

17:02.811 --> 17:04.343
What? Jeanette...

17:04.345 --> 17:06.729
Ted, listen to me.
You're being crazy.

17:06.731 --> 17:08.047
<i>I'm</i> being crazy?!

17:08.049 --> 17:11.150
Yes! How long have you been
hung up on Robin?

17:11.152 --> 17:12.852
Eight years?!

17:12.854 --> 17:14.153
And you're still
killing yourself

17:14.155 --> 17:16.739
to fetch dumb little trinkets
for her. That's crazy!

17:16.741 --> 17:18.324
That's more than crazy.

17:18.326 --> 17:20.142
I don't think there's a word
for what that is!

17:20.144 --> 17:22.944
Actually, there is a word
for that. It's "love."

17:23.864 --> 17:25.832
I'm in love with her, okay?

17:25.834 --> 17:28.317
If you're looking for the word
that means caring about someone

17:28.319 --> 17:30.786
beyond all rationality
and wanting them to have

17:30.788 --> 17:32.421
everything they want,
no matter how much

17:32.423 --> 17:33.956
it destroys you, it's love!

17:34.925 --> 17:37.210
And when you love someone,
you just, you...

17:37.212 --> 17:38.794
you don't stop, ever.

17:38.796 --> 17:41.430
Even when people roll their
eyes or call you crazy.

17:41.432 --> 17:43.549
Even then. Especially then!

17:43.551 --> 17:46.135
You just-- you don't give up!
Because if I could give up...

17:46.137 --> 17:49.222
if I could just, you know,
take the whole world's advice

17:49.224 --> 17:52.475
and-and move on and find someone
else, that wouldn't be love.

17:52.477 --> 17:54.026
That would be...

17:54.028 --> 17:56.229
that would be some other
disposable thing

17:56.231 --> 17:59.148
that is not worth fighting for.

18:00.517 --> 18:04.871
But I--
that is not what this is.

18:04.873 --> 18:09.024
So, please, can I have
the locket?

18:13.547 --> 18:14.997
Cuckoo.

18:23.690 --> 18:26.726
I think we should
get back together.

18:31.665 --> 18:34.600
And... new day.

18:34.602 --> 18:38.104
Yep, new day.

18:39.222 --> 18:41.574
♪ Close your eyes...

18:55.757 --> 18:58.107
Don't get married
until you're 30.

18:58.109 --> 19:00.409
Play laser tag once a week.

19:00.411 --> 19:04.547
Give at least as many high fives
as you get.

19:04.549 --> 19:06.682
Teacup pigs are lady magnets,

19:06.684 --> 19:09.835
but very hard to care for.
Not worth the effort.

19:09.837 --> 19:14.690
The same goes for dogs
and babies.

19:15.425 --> 19:17.560
And most importantly,

19:17.562 --> 19:21.263
whatever you do in this life,

19:21.265 --> 19:23.232
it's not legendary

19:23.234 --> 19:25.451
unless your friends are there
to see it.

19:26.737 --> 19:29.956
Good luck, boys.

19:29.958 --> 19:32.792
Take care of
the game for me.

19:32.794 --> 19:35.227
We will.

19:36.463 --> 19:39.415
Did you ever get
his name?

19:39.417 --> 19:42.335
No. What'd he give you?

19:42.337 --> 19:43.336
I don't know,

19:43.338 --> 19:46.005

19:56.184 --> 19:57.600
It doesn't matter
where we live.

19:57.602 --> 19:58.818
I just want us
to be...

19:58.820 --> 20:00.252
We're staying in New York.

20:00.254 --> 20:01.654
What? No.

20:01.656 --> 20:03.322
Yes.

20:03.324 --> 20:06.242
