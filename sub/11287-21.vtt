00:02.366 --> 00:03.933
DAMN. DID YOU
READ THIS?

00:04.000 --> 00:05.333
WHAT'S WRONG, KYLE?

00:05.400 --> 00:08.933
"72‐YEAR‐OLD WOMAN
GIVES BIRTH TO TWINS."

00:09.000 --> 00:10.333
THE KIDS

00:10.400 --> 00:12.866
PROBABLY HAVE MORE TEETH
THAN THEIR MOTHER.

00:12.933 --> 00:14.866
I WAS LOOKING
AT THIS ARTICLE.

00:14.933 --> 00:18.566
THEY ARE ACTUALLY GOING
TO TEAR DOWN THE SHOWBOAT CLUB.

00:18.633 --> 00:22.200
IS THAT THAT OLD JAZZ CLUB
YOU KEEP RATTLING ON ABOUT?

00:22.266 --> 00:23.566
"OLD JAZZ CLUB"?

00:23.633 --> 00:26.833
TRY ONE OF THE PLACES
WHERE JAZZ WAS BORN.

00:26.900 --> 00:28.100
Khadijah:
LEVEL IT?

00:28.166 --> 00:31.100
THE OWNERS CLOSED THE CLUB
ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO

00:31.166 --> 00:34.100
BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T BRING
THE BUILDING UP TO CODE.

00:34.166 --> 00:37.433
I SPOKE TO SOME INVESTORS,
BUT THEY WANTED TO INVEST

00:37.500 --> 00:40.366
IN SOMETHING SAFER,
LIKE COLORING BOOKS ON TAPE.

00:41.366 --> 00:43.300
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS COUNTRY?

00:43.366 --> 00:45.933
IT'S LIKE WE GOT NO RESPECT
FOR THE PAST.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.633
MUST ALL OUR CULTURAL SHRINES
FALL PREY TO CAPITALISM'S GODS

00:49.700 --> 00:51.933
LIKE THE STRIP MALL
AND CHAIN STORE?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.466
THEY'RE TEARING
IT DOWN

00:53.533 --> 00:56.033

THE SHOWBOAT WAS A HAVEN

MOST FAMOUS GANGSTERS

01:40.462 --> 01:43.795
RENOWNED FOR GUNNING DOWN PEOPLE
WHILE WEARING HIGH HEELS.

YOU KNOW, THE JAZZ AGE
WAS VERY MUCH LIKE ME‐‐

01:47.195 --> 01:49.229
FASCINATING, FABULOUS,
GLAMOROUS.

I'D HAVE BEEN A REAL DIVA

SOME KIND
OF LEGAL INJUNCTION

02:04.335 --> 02:06.802
TO KEEP THEM FROM
TEARING THE PLACE DOWN?

02:06.869 --> 02:10.602
IF THE CITY DESIGNATES IT
A LANDMARK, NO ONE CAN TOUCH IT.

02:10.669 --> 02:12.202
OH, THAT'S
BRILLIANT, MAX.

02:12.269 --> 02:13.669

ON MY STAGE

SAMMY DAVIS

TURN AROUND, KID.

05:14.555 --> 05:15.822

AFTER THAT HORSE
KICKED ME IN MY HEAD

THINGS LOOKED BLEAK

05:20.989 --> 05:22.422
FOR A WHILE.

05:22.489 --> 05:26.755
BUT THEN MY DOG STARTED GIVING
ME SOME REALLY GOOD ADVICE.

05:26.822 --> 05:27.922
YES, HE DID.

05:27.989 --> 05:29.255

YES.

10:22.089 --> 10:24.122
I CARE AGAIN NOW.

10:24.189 --> 10:26.455
YOU KNOW WHAT, KID?

10:26.522 --> 10:27.522
YOU GOT MOXIE.

10:27.589 --> 10:29.855
BUT YOU'RE LONG‐WINDED
AND POMPOUS.

10:29.922 --> 10:31.455
TURN IN YOUR APRON.

10:31.522 --> 10:33.822
YOU'RE FIRED.

10:33.889 --> 10:37.922
I'M NOT LEAVING UNTIL
I GET MY SEVERANCE PAY.

10:39.655 --> 10:43.022
DIESEL, GIVE HIM
HIS SEVERANCE PAY.

11:03.072 --> 11:03.617
Claire:
REPENT!

11:03.684 --> 11:05.117
REPENT, SINNERS!

11:05.184 --> 11:07.451
LIQUOR IS
THE DEVIL'S DRINK!

11:07.517 --> 11:09.717
IT'S BEELZEBUB'S BEVERAGE!

11:09.784 --> 11:12.151
SAVE YOUR SOUL, SINNER.
SAVE YOUR SOUL.

11:12.217 --> 11:13.517
HELLO, GORGEOUS.

11:13.584 --> 11:14.784
LORD, GIVE ME STRENGTH.

11:14.851 --> 11:16.151
NOW, MISS CLAIRE

11:16.217 --> 11:18.517
BEFORE YOU LOOSEN
ANY MORE OF MY TEETH

11:18.584 --> 11:20.284
I JUST THOUGHT
I'D STOP DOWN

11:20.351 --> 11:22.317
AND HELP OUT
THE CAUSE A LITTLE.

11:22.384 --> 11:24.884
OH, THE LAST THING
THE CAUSE NEEDS

11:24.951 --> 11:26.484
IS YOUR DIRTY LIQUOR MONEY.

11:26.551 --> 11:29.917
OH, NO, THIS IS NOT
MY DIRTY LIQUOR MONEY.

11:29.984 --> 11:32.384
IT'S RIGHT HERE.

11:32.451 --> 11:35.584
JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE
A SPIFFY DADDY WARBUCKS 'DO

11:35.651 --> 11:38.951
DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE GOING
TO RATTLE MY TAMBOURINE.

11:39.017 --> 11:40.184
OKAY.

11:40.251 --> 11:42.851
PERHAPS WE, UH, GOT OFF
ON THE WRONG FOOT.

11:42.917 --> 11:45.884
LET'S JUST, UH,
KISS AND MAKE UP.

11:45.951 --> 11:47.217
( grunts )

11:50.184 --> 11:52.717
HEY, LADY, HAVE YOU
SEEN HOOCH JONES?

11:52.784 --> 11:55.884
WHAT POSSIBLE BUSINESS
COULD YOU LITTLE ANGELS HAVE

11:55.951 --> 11:57.784
WITH THAT NO‐GOOD HEATHEN?

11:57.851 --> 11:59.784
WE WANT TO THANK HIM
FOR BUILDING US

11:59.851 --> 12:01.624
A SWELL KITCHEN
AT THE ORPHANAGE.

12:01.691 --> 12:02.891
AND FOR COOKING US

12:02.957 --> 12:04.757
A BIG PANCAKE BREAKFAST
AND EVERYTHING.

12:04.824 --> 12:06.491
PANCAKES? KITCHEN?

12:06.557 --> 12:07.291
EVERYTHING?

12:07.357 --> 12:08.424
SURE.

12:08.491 --> 12:09.724
WHEN HE ISN'T COOKING

12:09.791 --> 12:11.257
HE SHOWS US
HOW TO FIX STUFF.

12:11.324 --> 12:12.991
YESTERDAY,
HE SHOWED ME

12:13.057 --> 12:14.991
HOW TO USE
THE PLUMBER'S HELPER.

12:15.057 --> 12:16.691
I WENT OVER TO ST. CECILIA'S

12:16.757 --> 12:20.157
AND EARNED A NICKEL UNCLOGGING
FATHER PATTERSON'S CRAPPER.

12:20.224 --> 12:22.591
WHEN WE GROW UP

12:22.657 --> 12:24.557
WE ALL WANT TO BE
FIX‐IT GUYS
JUST LIKE HOOCH.

12:24.624 --> 12:26.057
OH, MY GOODNESS.

12:26.124 --> 12:29.691
WELL... I MAY HAVE MISJUDGED
THE POOR SOUL.

12:29.757 --> 12:33.024
LOTS OF PEOPLE MISJUDGE HOOCH.

12:33.091 --> 12:38.091
IF I HAVE BEEN WRONG ABOUT
HOOCH JONES, GIVE ME A SIGN.

12:40.891 --> 12:43.657
WHAT? YOU'RE OUT OF THUNDER?

12:43.724 --> 12:45.557
GOSH!

12:45.624 --> 12:46.857
HEY.

12:46.924 --> 12:48.224
HI.

12:48.291 --> 12:50.824
SO DID THEY RUN
THE "SAVE THE SHOWBOAT" PIECE?

12:50.891 --> 12:53.891
NO. THEY BUMPED IT FOR
AN ENTHRALLING EDITORIAL

12:53.957 --> 12:55.391
ON FAKE FAT.

12:55.457 --> 12:57.591
I MEAN, WHY SAVE
A CULTURAL ICON

12:57.657 --> 12:59.857
WHEN YOU CAN EXPOUND
ON TOLLHOUSE COOKIES

12:59.924 --> 13:01.664
THAT SLIDE
RIGHT THROUGH YOU?

13:01.731 --> 13:05.197
WELL, WHY DON'T WE BOMBARD
THE PLANNING COMMISSION

13:05.264 --> 13:07.497
WITH TELEGRAMS?

13:07.564 --> 13:10.431
THE ONLY REASON BARETTA
IS ON TV TODAY

13:10.497 --> 13:13.997
IS BECAUSE I SENT HUNDREDS
OF THEM TO THE NETWORK.

13:15.131 --> 13:18.964
BARETTA HAS BEEN CANCELED
FOR YEARS.

13:19.031 --> 13:21.431
BARETTA'S NOT CANCELED.

13:21.497 --> 13:23.631
IT'S ON HIATUS.

13:23.697 --> 13:24.831
OOH.

13:24.897 --> 13:25.964
HEY, KYLE.

13:26.031 --> 13:27.664
I CAME FROM
THE DEMOLITION YARD.

13:27.731 --> 13:28.664
UH‐HUH.

13:28.731 --> 13:29.831
I TOLD MY BUDDIES

13:29.897 --> 13:31.597
HOW IMPORTANT
THE SHOWBOAT WAS

13:31.664 --> 13:32.831
TO JAZZ HISTORY.

13:32.897 --> 13:34.997
AS SOON AS THEY
WIPED BACK THE TEARS

13:35.064 --> 13:36.664
THEY BEGAN TO LOAD
THE DYNAMITE

13:36.731 --> 13:37.931
BACK INTO THE PICKUP.

13:37.997 --> 13:39.397
( phone ringing )

13:39.464 --> 13:41.231
HELLO?

13:41.297 --> 13:42.497
HI. OH! OH!

13:42.564 --> 13:44.731
KYLE, IT'S MAX,
CALLING FROM CITY HALL.

13:44.797 --> 13:45.831
COOL.

13:45.897 --> 13:47.097
HEY, MAX.

13:47.164 --> 13:48.831
UH‐HUH.

13:48.897 --> 13:50.164
UH‐HUH.

13:50.231 --> 13:52.631
UH‐HUH.

13:52.697 --> 13:55.264
YEAH, WELL, YOU DID
WHAT YOU COULD DO.

13:55.331 --> 13:56.831
YEAH, THANKS ANYWAY.

13:56.897 --> 13:58.231
PEACE.

13:59.331 --> 14:01.904
SO?!

14:01.971 --> 14:04.704
IT DIDN'T WORK, SYNCLAIRE.

14:04.771 --> 14:06.537
BUT IF I HAVE
TO THROW MYSELF

14:06.604 --> 14:08.737
IN FRONT OF THAT BULLDOZER
TO STOP THEM

14:08.804 --> 14:11.504
FROM DEMOLISHING THAT CLUB,
THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO.

14:19.271 --> 14:20.937
HEY THERE.

14:21.004 --> 14:22.471
OH, KYLE.

14:22.537 --> 14:24.537
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:24.604 --> 14:27.271
I THOUGHT BIG MAX
SENT YOU PACKING.

14:27.337 --> 14:29.204
I COULDN'T
GO BACK TO CLEVELAND

14:29.271 --> 14:31.404
WITHOUT HEARING KAY SING
ONE LAST TIME.

14:31.471 --> 14:34.104
HOW MANY OF THOSE PICTURES
YOU GOING TO SIGN?

14:34.171 --> 14:35.704
FIVE THOUSAND.

14:35.771 --> 14:40.671
ONE FOR EVERY FAN ATTENDING
MY CHRISTMAS SHOW THIS AUGUST.

14:42.604 --> 14:44.137
Big Max:
OH, KYLE

14:44.204 --> 14:45.504
BARKER!

14:45.571 --> 14:47.171
YOU'RE BREAKING MY HEART.

14:47.237 --> 14:49.337
I KNEW YOU'D COME
CRAWLING BACK

14:49.404 --> 14:50.637
FOR YOUR JOB.

14:50.704 --> 14:52.904
BUT, I'LL DO YOU
ONE BETTER.

14:52.971 --> 14:55.871
DO THE BOX SPRING
BOOGIE WITH ME

14:55.937 --> 14:57.937
AND I'LL LET YOU SING.

14:58.004 --> 14:59.504
DOESN'T TRADING A FAVOR

14:59.571 --> 15:02.177
FOR A MEANINGLESS
PHYSICAL ENCOUNTER BOTHER YOU?

15:02.244 --> 15:04.377
HEY, HEY, HEY,
I'M NO FLOOZY.

15:04.444 --> 15:07.411
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO
THE NOOKIE‐SNOOKIE WITH ME

15:07.477 --> 15:10.177
UNTIL YOU WHISPER
SWEET NOTHINGS IN MY EAR.

15:10.244 --> 15:12.577
YOU'RE A DISGUSTING,
PERVERTED WITCH.

15:14.244 --> 15:16.744
THAT WORKS FOR ME.

15:16.811 --> 15:18.811
OH, MISS CLAIRE.

15:18.877 --> 15:20.377
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

15:20.444 --> 15:22.077
I CAME TO APOLOGIZE.

15:22.144 --> 15:24.877
YOUR TURNED THE OTHER CHEEK
AND I BELTED IT.

15:24.944 --> 15:27.244
OH, HOOCH,
WHY NOT LEAVE THIS LIFE

15:27.311 --> 15:30.144
OF WRETCHED, VULGAR
YUCKINESS?

15:30.211 --> 15:33.044
AH, NOT TO WORRY,
MY SOUL‐SAVING SIREN.

15:33.111 --> 15:36.211
I'VE JUST MADE ENOUGH MONEY
TO MAKE THE FINAL TWO REPAIRS

15:36.277 --> 15:37.544
TO THE ORPHANAGE.

15:37.611 --> 15:39.611
A NEW ROOF
AND A PUTTING GREEN.

15:39.677 --> 15:41.477
AS OF TOMORROW

15:41.544 --> 15:43.244
I'LL BE OBEDIAH JONES.

15:43.311 --> 15:46.311
FULL‐TIME CHURCH‐GOING
CARPENTRY TEACHER.

15:51.877 --> 15:54.811
SORRY, BIG MAX, I WON'T BE ABLE
TO SING HERE TONIGHT

15:54.877 --> 15:56.277
OR EVER AGAIN.

15:56.344 --> 15:59.411
YOU SEE, MR. FASSBINDER HERE
FROM TURNAROUND STUDIOS

15:59.477 --> 16:01.484
IS TAKING ME TO HOLLYWOOD.

16:01.551 --> 16:03.751
I'M GOING TO DO THE TALKIES.

16:03.817 --> 16:05.817
LEAVE ME IN A LURCH
LIKE THIS?

16:05.884 --> 16:08.151
WHY I'LL PUT A BULLET
IN YOUR EAR.

16:08.217 --> 16:09.817
HEY, HEY.

16:09.884 --> 16:12.617

REMEMBER?

16:12.684 --> 16:14.584
DAMN!

16:16.451 --> 16:18.217
GOODBYE, EVERYONE.

THANK YOU.

16:19.651 --> 16:20.884

16:20.951 --> 16:23.317
TRY THE VEAL.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.351
WHAT DO I DO NOW?

16:26.417 --> 16:28.717
WHO DO I GET TO PERFORM?

16:30.251 --> 16:31.784
AW...

16:31.851 --> 16:35.717
ALL RIGHT, BARITONE BUNS...
YOU'RE ON.

16:35.784 --> 16:36.984
WAIT A MINUTE.

16:37.051 --> 16:39.484
YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST
SNAP YOUR FINGERS

16:39.551 --> 16:41.917
AND I'LL GET UP ON THIS STAGE
AND SING?

16:41.984 --> 16:43.717
DO YOU KNOW
"SWEET GEORGIA BROWN"?

16:43.784 --> 16:46.417
UM, HOW ABOUT
"AIN'T MISBEHAVIN'"?

16:46.484 --> 16:47.917
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY"?

16:47.984 --> 16:49.051
NO.

16:49.117 --> 16:50.917
LOOK, JUST GIVE ME
AN INTRO

16:50.984 --> 16:52.251
AND WORK WITH ME.

17:14.523 --> 17:16.023
OH, COME ON, O'KEEFE!

17:16.090 --> 17:18.590
IT'S NOT LIKE WE DON'T HAVE
AN UNDERSTANDING HERE.

17:18.656 --> 17:20.757
YOU NEVER CALL.
YOU DON'T WRITE.

17:20.824 --> 17:22.991
YOU'RE GOING DOWNTOWN.

17:23.057 --> 17:24.424
OH, OBEDIAH.

17:24.491 --> 17:26.191
YEAH...

MAKE SURE THE KIDS
GET THE NEW ROOF

17:28.290 --> 17:30.391
THE PUTTING GREEN
AND THEIR PANCAKES.

17:30.457 --> 17:32.091
AND REMEMBER,
ON THE WEEKENDS

17:32.157 --> 17:33.924
THEY LIKE
SEASONAL BERRIES.

17:33.991 --> 17:35.257
WAIT. OFFICER...

17:35.324 --> 17:36.691
OFFICER, LOOK.

17:36.757 --> 17:39.257
THE ONLY DREAM I'VE
EVER HAD WAS TO

17:39.324 --> 17:41.691
GET UP HERE AND SING
AT THE SHOWBOAT CLUB.

17:41.757 --> 17:43.724
SO, PLEASE, CAN YOU
JUST TURN AROUND

17:43.791 --> 17:45.624
AND LET ME CROON
FOR A MINUTE?

17:45.691 --> 17:47.624
A MAN WITH A DREAM, IS IT?

17:47.691 --> 17:49.857
IT, IT BRINGS A TEAR TO ME EYE

17:49.924 --> 17:52.124
AND A LUMP TO ME THROAT.

17:52.191 --> 17:55.257
SAY, DO YOU KNOW
"WHEN IRISH EYES ARE SMILING"?

17:58.991 --> 18:00.264
NO.

18:00.331 --> 18:02.197
MOVE IT ALONG THEN.

18:02.264 --> 18:03.697
I HAVEN'T GOT
ALL DAY.

18:03.764 --> 18:05.031
CAN I GET MY HAT?

18:05.097 --> 18:06.631
ALL RIGHT,
I'M GOING.

18:21.431 --> 18:23.197
UM, EXCUSE ME.

18:23.264 --> 18:26.964
I'M WORKING TO TRY TO GET THIS
PLACE PRESERVED AS A LANDMARK.

18:27.031 --> 18:29.797
IS THERE ANY WAY I CAN
POSTPONE THE DEMOLITION?

18:29.864 --> 18:33.431
NOT EVEN IF YOU DOVE
IN FRONT OF THE BULLDOZER.

18:33.497 --> 18:35.031
I WAS AFRAID OF THAT.

18:35.097 --> 18:38.197
WELL, LOOK, CAN I HAVE
FIVE MINUTES TO LOOK AROUND

18:38.264 --> 18:40.031
AND SAY MY LAST GOOD‐BYES?

18:40.097 --> 18:41.364
NO WAY.

18:41.431 --> 18:42.964
