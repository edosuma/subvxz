- All right, sounds good.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.580
- Uh, boy, uh--
It's--it's really great.

09:08.615 --> 09:09.815
So nice to see that.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.416
And so nice
to see looping used.

09:11.452 --> 09:12.651
I love--I love looping.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.319
And a, uh,--
You know the Beatles

09:14.355 --> 09:17.656
did a, uh-- "White Album,"
and on it was "Revolution 9."

09:17.691 --> 09:20.792
If you played that backwards,
you got, "Tur-me-on-dedmen,"

09:20.828 --> 09:23.028
Tur-me-on-dedmen,
Tur-me-on-dedmen.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.996
And I would play that
on my tape, uh--

09:25.032 --> 09:28.033
on my, uh, turntable--
way back when we had those--

09:28.068 --> 09:30.569
backwards over and over again
till I could do it.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.704
And then I got a tape recorder,
then tested it,

09:32.740 --> 09:35.674
so I could actually say
number nine backwards.

09:35.709 --> 09:38.610
Made the whole thing very,
very plausible, and very good.

09:38.645 --> 09:41.413
But you know,
like all good magicians,

09:41.448 --> 09:43.749
you told a lie right up top.

09:43.784 --> 09:46.551
Right at the very beginning,
really early on.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.420
One that
everybody else believed,

09:48.455 --> 09:51.923
and, uh, we even believed
until we saw the trick.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.258
So I'm gonna give you--

09:53.293 --> 09:55.227
I've already told you
that part of that.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.762
But I'll give you
the other part of that,

09:56.797 --> 09:59.464
in, uh--uh, backwards.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.600
Ee-sorf.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.602
Ee-sorf.
[laughter]

10:03.637 --> 10:04.770
Wasn't it?
- Uh...

10:04.805 --> 10:06.705
- Do you understand
ee-sorf?

10:06.740 --> 10:09.174
- I--I understand that, yeah.
Completely.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.942
I'm not as good at code...
- [laughing]

10:10.978 --> 10:13.078
- You understand?
- Welcome to my world.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.414
- I'm a middle school teacher.
- [laughing]

10:15.449 --> 10:17.516
- Okay, so it sounds like
they know how you did it.

10:17.551 --> 10:19.151
- Yes. Yes, absolutely.
Very good.

10:19.186 --> 10:21.720
- Well, thank you so much.
Ryan Chandler!

10:21.755 --> 10:23.522
- Thank you very much.
Thank you.

10:23.557 --> 10:25.123
[cheering and applause]

10:25.159 --> 10:27.292
- Don't you...
No, no!

10:27.327 --> 10:29.928
Get away from there!
- [laughs]

10:29.963 --> 10:32.264
- After the break,
Penn and Teller try

10:32.299 --> 10:33.598
to bust more magicians.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.767
And later, they'll perform
a trick of their own.

10:35.803 --> 10:37.169
Don't go anywhere.

[cheering]

12:05.926 --> 12:07.292
Yeah.

12:07.327 --> 12:10.028
When I was a kid in the 1980s,
I saw Penn and Teller

12:10.063 --> 12:11.897
on television,
performing an act

12:11.932 --> 12:14.332
with just a pencil
and a cigarette.

12:14.368 --> 12:16.735
This act fooled me and
taught me the basics of magic.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.503
So, Penn, Teller.

12:18.539 --> 12:21.206
I now present to you
what you inspired in me

12:21.241 --> 12:23.341
30 years ago.

12:23.377 --> 12:25.744
I'm going to hurt your brain...
[laughter]

12:25.779 --> 12:28.313
Using these four cards
and four coins

12:28.348 --> 12:32.450
in an original routine I call
The Ultimate Matrix.

12:32.486 --> 12:35.487
In just a moment, these coins
are going to magically appear

12:35.522 --> 12:38.056
and disappear,
changing their positions

12:38.091 --> 12:39.858
around this square.

12:39.893 --> 12:43.228
Travelling from their corners
to all come together.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.564
Gathering here in this corner,

12:45.599 --> 12:49.267
and landing underneath
this square.

12:49.303 --> 12:51.603
And if I can create
the illusion

12:51.638 --> 12:54.072
that those coins move
without me using my hands,

12:54.107 --> 12:55.907
well, then..

12:55.943 --> 12:57.909

Four coins in a square,
a card over each coin.

13:09.690 --> 13:13.491

this does happen very fast.

13:15.295 --> 13:18.129

13:18.165 --> 13:19.764

Not a problem.

13:19.800 --> 13:23.234
Everybody,
do not blink your eyes,

13:23.270 --> 13:25.637

one more time.

13:47.194 --> 13:50.528
Go from the side.

13:50.564 --> 13:53.665

may actually see the last one

13:53.700 --> 13:55.333
disappear from my fingertips.

13:55.369 --> 14:01.239
Watch this last coin vanish,
creating a tremor in the force

14:01.274 --> 14:03.341
as 100,000 children
watching this

14:03.377 --> 14:06.244
suddenly decide
that magic is cool.

14:06.279 --> 14:09.514

may Google me now.

14:15.188 --> 14:18.089

14:18.125 --> 14:20.625
This time visibly,
so you actually see

14:20.661 --> 14:22.427
each coin jump.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.295
This is the part
that hits people hard.

14:24.331 --> 14:29.200
All I have to do is make
the mysterious Asian sounds.

14:29.236 --> 14:31.636
[sharp breathy exhalations]

14:31.672 --> 14:34.305
There's the first one.
[applause]

14:34.341 --> 14:37.142
I'll do it again.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.010
[sharp breathy exhalations]

14:39.046 --> 14:40.845
And that makes three.

14:40.881 --> 14:45.583
The next one--no hands,
just because I can.

14:45.619 --> 14:47.152
[breathes out]

14:47.187 --> 14:50.722
Vanishes here,
reappears in the corner.

14:50.757 --> 14:54.526
And I'm in beast mode.
[applause]

14:56.296 --> 14:59.164
That's what it looks like
using four cards for cover.

14:59.199 --> 15:01.366
This time, no cards.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.635
Just my bare hands
and a dose of honesty.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.670
[laughter]
I've been performing magic

15:05.706 --> 15:07.238
since I was eight years old,

15:07.274 --> 15:10.909
and it took me 12 years
to create this act.

15:10.944 --> 15:14.345
So for me, this is not
just a magic trick.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.448
This is something far deeper,

15:16.483 --> 15:19.951
and a thousand times
more savage.

15:19.986 --> 15:23.788
A work of terrifying beauty
that has been growing

15:23.824 --> 15:27.092
all my life,
like an uncontrollable weed

15:27.127 --> 15:31.663
in the garden of my mind.
[applause]

15:31.698 --> 15:35.166
I have crossed oceans of time
and vast empires

15:35.202 --> 15:38.803
to be here today, so I take
the honor of performing here

15:38.839 --> 15:40.271
very seriously.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.707
The amount of mental energy
I've invested

15:42.743 --> 15:46.578
in creating this act
could demolish planets.

15:46.613 --> 15:49.814
This is the most epic monologue
in the history of magic.

15:49.850 --> 15:51.716
For I am here...
[laughter]

15:51.752 --> 15:54.352
To inflict
psychological damage,

15:54.387 --> 15:56.221
and that means...

15:56.256 --> 16:00.325
We're not done yet.
[applause]

16:07.234 --> 16:10.335
You've now seen the devastation
I can generate using two hands.

16:10.370 --> 16:11.903
Let's take this
to the next level.

16:11.938 --> 16:14.539
I'll do it again with just...

16:14.574 --> 16:16.407
One hand.

16:16.443 --> 16:18.076
You can ask any magician
around the world

16:18.111 --> 16:20.278
about performing
an illusion this clean,

16:20.313 --> 16:22.113
using just one hand,
and they will tell you that

16:22.149 --> 16:24.749
it is physically impossible.

16:24.785 --> 16:28.620
And it looks like this.

16:28.655 --> 16:32.957
Booyah.
[applause]

16:32.993 --> 16:35.293
Watch the next one.
I get nowhere near those coins

16:35.328 --> 16:39.464
with my hand and still--
vanishes from here,

16:39.499 --> 16:40.498
reappears in the corner.

16:40.534 --> 16:42.767
And I am the Jackie Chan
of magic.

16:42.803 --> 16:47.806
[laughter]
[cheering and applause]

16:47.841 --> 16:51.042
The next one will invisibly fly
from here to there,

16:51.077 --> 16:53.044
forming a perfect square.

16:53.079 --> 16:54.813
It happens
on the count of three.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.581
Get ready for this.
I've seen it all--

16:56.616 --> 16:57.982
nosebleeds, seizures...
[laughter]

16:58.018 --> 17:00.852
There's one, there's two,
that's three.

17:00.887 --> 17:02.987
[audience amazement]
And as promised,

17:03.023 --> 17:05.490
I can now actually show you
a perfect square,

17:05.525 --> 17:08.492
formed by one, two, three,
and four coins,

17:08.528 --> 17:10.461
with just one hand!

17:10.497 --> 17:12.864
[cheering and applause]

17:12.898 --> 17:15.200
You would not believe
how epic this feels!

17:15.234 --> 17:18.703
My heart is pounding,
and I can feel the adrenaline

17:18.738 --> 17:21.271
coursing through my veins.

17:21.308 --> 17:23.141
I'd like to thank each
and every one of you

17:23.175 --> 17:24.742
for sharing this moment
with me,

17:24.778 --> 17:27.878
because just being here
was a dream come true.

17:27.914 --> 17:30.682
So for everyone watching:
if you have a dream,

17:30.717 --> 17:33.318
never give up believing
in your dream,

17:33.353 --> 17:36.054
living your dream,
and doing something every day

17:36.089 --> 17:38.156
to make that dream happen.

17:38.191 --> 17:40.225
But remember one thing.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.393
No matter who you are,

17:42.429 --> 17:44.762
no matter how hard you work,

17:44.798 --> 17:47.565
or how good you think you are
at what you do,

17:47.601 --> 17:52.370
there will always be an Asian
who takes it to the next level.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.404
[laughter,
cheering and applause]

17:53.440 --> 17:55.406
Yeah!
I'm Ryan Hayashi,

17:55.442 --> 17:57.041
the Samurai Madman of Magic!

17:57.077 --> 17:58.877
Show me some love!

17:58.912 --> 18:02.680
[cheering and applause]

18:02.716 --> 18:05.850
- Ryan Hayashi!

18:05.886 --> 18:08.519
That was amazing!
- Thank you.

18:08.555 --> 18:09.988
- Wow!
- [laughs]

18:10.023 --> 18:11.389
- That was really incredible.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.291
I didn't know if I wanted
to look at you,

18:13.326 --> 18:16.294
or just watch Teller
be so amazed and impressed.

18:16.329 --> 18:17.662
- [laughing]
- Oh, my gosh.

18:17.697 --> 18:20.698
You really are the samurai
of magic--of coin magic.

18:20.734 --> 18:22.300
- Feel--feel the heat--
heat radiate--

18:22.335 --> 18:24.202
radiating off of me right now.
- I know.

18:24.237 --> 18:25.870
- I am a walking cloud
of testosterone right now.

18:25.906 --> 18:27.505
[laughter]
I feel like--

18:27.540 --> 18:30.441
I feel like zombie Bruce Lee
on steroids.

18:30.477 --> 18:31.776
[laughter]
- Wow. I don't even know

18:31.811 --> 18:33.578
how to talk to you,
I'm so impressed.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.480
- Wind me up and let me go.
- Okay!

18:35.515 --> 18:38.283
- I'm like a ninja Shakespeare
crossed with Hannibal Lecter.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.285
- [laughs] Oh!
Ugh!

18:40.320 --> 18:42.086
- Would you like
to ask me a question, Alyson?

18:42.122 --> 18:43.888
- No, I just want to watch you.

18:43.924 --> 18:46.424
[laughter]

- Okay.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.161
What do you eat for breakfast?
'Cause I need

18:50.196 --> 18:51.796
to start eating it.
- I live on broccoli

18:51.831 --> 18:53.164
and blueberries.
- [laughs]

18:53.199 --> 18:55.466
- Can I say something?
Can I say something

18:55.502 --> 18:56.935
really honest
to Penn and Teller?

18:56.970 --> 18:59.270
Uh, when I was a kid, really,
they blew me away

18:59.306 --> 19:01.172
with this act they do
with a pencil.

19:01.207 --> 19:03.408

to come here today--

19:03.443 --> 19:04.776
I've never met them
before today--

19:04.811 --> 19:08.846
and show this to them,
it's not me showing my work.

19:08.882 --> 19:11.983
It's showing them the effect,
uh, one act on TV

19:12.018 --> 19:13.384
can have on a little kid,
you know?

19:13.420 --> 19:15.186

to them and saying,

19:15.221 --> 19:16.654

- That's amazing...

19:25.765 --> 19:28.866
This is Season 5, and the last
four seasons before me--

19:28.902 --> 19:33.104
240 performers on this stage--
only three coin guys before me.

19:33.139 --> 19:34.272
And that--that means something.

19:34.307 --> 19:35.807
It's hard to put
a coin act together,

19:35.842 --> 19:38.176

Uh, I tried my best.

19:38.211 --> 19:39.744
I-I hope it resonated
with the people.

19:39.779 --> 19:41.346
I hope you liked it.
- You certainly did.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.281
[cheering and applause]
You certainly did.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.116
But let's see
what the guys think.

19:45.151 --> 19:47.819
- Okay.
- Okay, Penn and Teller.

19:47.854 --> 19:51.189
- Oh, Ryan, baby.
Boy, that's a--wow.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.825
That's a--
that's a really good act.

19:53.860 --> 19:57.562
And, uh, you were just saying
how hard coin magic is to do.

19:57.597 --> 20:00.231
And we've done versions
of matrix--or Teller has.

20:00.266 --> 20:03.701
And, uh, we've seen matrix
a--a zillion times.

20:03.737 --> 20:08.539
But you added to that,
so, so, um--

20:08.575 --> 20:11.976
So much comedy and personality,
and also a really different,

20:12.012 --> 20:14.679
fresh way to do that,
a fresh style.

20:14.714 --> 20:18.216
The, um, bravado coupled
with the comedy on that,

20:18.251 --> 20:19.951
the wink on every bit of it.

20:19.986 --> 20:23.087
And we were, uh, you know,
we were following you, uh,

20:23.123 --> 20:25.289

20:25.325 --> 20:27.058

how you do those moves.

20:27.093 --> 20:30.862

and followed you, and then we--

20:30.897 --> 20:34.098

That is incredible.

26:25.618 --> 26:27.218
You invented that trick.

26:27.253 --> 26:29.186
- Yeah.
About 25 years ago, I invented

26:29.222 --> 26:31.055
the floating table part.

26:31.090 --> 26:35.025
And then it took me
another 23 years to come up

- Wow.

26:37.430 --> 26:39.563
It's incredible,

26:39.599 --> 26:42.133

26:42.168 --> 26:43.367

26:43.403 --> 26:45.069
- You know, it took

26:45.104 --> 26:47.004

I never planned to invent it.
It just happened.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.176
- That's so cool.
So every time you make

26:52.211 --> 26:54.912
a table vanish, do you have to
then go get a new one?

27:17.136 --> 27:18.235
there's stuff here
we haven't seen.

27:18.271 --> 27:20.070
And what I love
about this act--

27:20.106 --> 27:23.240
You know, when a young person
starts to learn to play guitar?

27:23.276 --> 27:24.642
You know?
- Yeah.

27:24.677 --> 27:26.644
- And they, uh, they play
an E chord, and they just play

27:26.679 --> 27:28.612
that E chord--you know,
Springsteen talked about

27:28.648 --> 27:31.582
getting guitars playing E
over and over again forever.

27:31.617 --> 27:34.485
And then you see someone
who's on stage,

27:34.520 --> 27:36.854
is a real guitar player,
who plays that E.

27:36.889 --> 27:39.824
It's a wonderful feeling,
'cause you see how sloppy

27:39.859 --> 27:42.660
and terrible yours is,
and how great it can be.

27:42.695 --> 27:45.763
I love that this is based
on a simple trick

27:45.798 --> 27:48.265
that young magicians can do.

27:48.301 --> 27:51.402
And when they watch you do it,
they will have no idea

27:51.437 --> 27:52.770
how it's done.
- Yeah.

27:52.805 --> 27:54.138
- It's just great,
it's just great

27:54.173 --> 27:56.207
that it starts out going,
Oh, yeah, I know, I know.

27:56.242 --> 27:59.677
And there's a lot of smug
14-year-olds watching this

27:59.712 --> 28:02.279
who then are shut up
by this routine.

28:02.315 --> 28:04.415
[laughter]
Uh, you add the candle,

28:04.450 --> 28:07.518
and that candle is so, uh,
so helpful to the routine.

28:07.553 --> 28:09.353
It's not just the table
floating around.

28:09.388 --> 28:11.021
There's also the candle there.

28:11.057 --> 28:14.325
And the vanish at the end
we weren't expecting.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.126
So we had to, uh--
we had to scramble

28:16.162 --> 28:19.163
a little bit on that.
We have an idea where it is.

28:19.198 --> 28:22.266
And I--I hate
to even be cagey about this

28:22.301 --> 28:26.103

and it's so based on stuff

28:26.138 --> 28:28.272

will know.

28:28.307 --> 28:30.407

to give away anything,

we know where that table went.

at home to hear this,

I was interested in magic,

35:25.057 --> 35:27.024

a hundred dollar bill

35:27.059 --> 35:28.959
in 1973...
- Whoa.

35:28.994 --> 35:32.329
And took me to Bob Hutching's
Magic Shack in Jacksonville.

35:32.364 --> 35:34.498
And that day I bought
the linking rings,

35:34.533 --> 35:37.935
the cups and balls, and a book
called "Bobo's Coin Magic."

35:37.970 --> 35:40.537
And I perform all three
of those tricks

35:40.572 --> 35:42.639
in my full-length shows
every time.

I know that--

35:45.077 --> 35:47.044

are the tricks

35:47.079 --> 35:49.746

- Yeah.

the usual magic slang.

is completely empty.

39:26.398 --> 39:27.364
[audience amazement]
- Wow.

39:27.399 --> 39:28.365
- We thought we'd, uh...

39:28.400 --> 39:30.000
[applause]

39:30.035 --> 39:33.136
If we were trying to bust this,
we'd notice the, uh,

39:33.172 --> 39:34.471
the stripes here...
- Oh-hoh-hoh.

39:34.506 --> 39:36.339
- And the fact
that the angles in front--

39:36.375 --> 39:37.908
And there's a mirror there,
you just pull it--

39:37.943 --> 39:41.178
You can see it move, there.
It reflects this as the side;

39:41.213 --> 39:43.146
you think it's the back.
And if you look at it--

39:43.182 --> 39:44.714
you know,
mirrors do all this stuff.

39:44.750 --> 39:47.350
If you can crouch down
a little bit, sometimes

39:47.386 --> 39:49.052
the mirror will give you--
like, a fun-house mirror.

39:49.087 --> 39:50.353
- Oh, yeah.
- It gives you

39:50.389 --> 39:51.788
a different angle.
So in this case,

39:51.823 --> 39:53.023
if you look down a little bit,
Teller could appear to be...

39:53.058 --> 39:54.424
[laughter]
Smaller.

39:54.459 --> 39:56.760
You see that? It's the angle.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:56.795 --> 39:58.161
- Angle is that way.
- I totally see that.

39:58.197 --> 40:00.363
- The angle is that way,
and Teller seems a lot smaller.

40:00.399 --> 40:01.498
And then if you get up--
Can you get up?

40:01.533 --> 40:02.766
I know you're
already wearing heels,

40:02.801 --> 40:04.868
but get up on your uh--
on your tip-toes, there.

40:04.903 --> 40:06.403
If we close the mirror again...
- Yeah.

40:06.438 --> 40:08.405
- And you get up kinda high...
- High.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.040
- I don't know if you've got
the angle right...

40:10.075 --> 40:11.575
- Maybe.
- But you should be able to see

40:11.610 --> 40:14.277
that Teller will look,
you know, a little bit bigger.

40:14.313 --> 40:16.012
Now, it's obviously
an illusion.

40:16.048 --> 40:17.714
We can't actually
make him bigger.

40:17.749 --> 40:19.583
- No, I totally see it!
- He looks bigger, doesn't he?

40:19.618 --> 40:21.718
- Yeah.
- And the great thing

40:21.753 --> 40:23.987
about this is, um...
[applause]

40:24.022 --> 40:26.189
Mirrors can do amazing stuff,
Alyson.

40:26.225 --> 40:28.758
You know when you're in--
maybe in a restroom,

40:28.794 --> 40:30.026
and they have the mirror
in front of you

40:30.062 --> 40:31.461
and the mirror behind you.

40:31.496 --> 40:33.296
And the--the, uh--
the reflections

40:33.332 --> 40:34.598
go back and forth,
and back and forth.

40:34.633 --> 40:35.932
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You can see, like,

40:35.968 --> 40:38.935
multiple images of yourself.
- Whoa.

40:38.971 --> 40:42.005
- I totally see that.
- So that's...

40:42.040 --> 40:44.274
- That's amazing.
- You can come over here

40:44.309 --> 40:45.542
and join us.
- Wow!

40:45.577 --> 40:47.844
That was incredible!
- Yeah, well, you know.

40:47.879 --> 40:49.179
- Yeah.
- That's--that's the, uh,

40:49.214 --> 40:50.947
that's the box.
- It's multiple Tellers.

40:50.983 --> 40:52.148
- Yeah, many.
- Huh!

40:52.184 --> 40:53.583
Well, that's all
for "Fool Us."

40:53.619 --> 40:55.986
Goodnight from Penn
and Teller and Teller

40:56.021 --> 40:58.388
and Teller!

40:58.423 --> 41:00.325
[cheering and applause]
