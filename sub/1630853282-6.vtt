(clears throat)
to wait six months.

15:58.207 --> 16:01.126
How, how am I supposed
to wait six months?

16:01.210 --> 16:02.753
It'll fly by, Bobs.

16:02.836 --> 16:06.423
Anyway, fuck that woman.
She doesn't know a thing.

16:06.507 --> 16:09.301
It's easy for you to say,
though, isn't it?

16:09.385 --> 16:13.681
-Bob...
-This was the most
important thing in my life.

16:15.599 --> 16:18.018
And I suppose I'm the one
who fucked it up?

16:18.102 --> 16:19.853
Bobbi:
I don't know.
You were there.

16:22.564 --> 16:23.941
Is that what
the social worker said?

16:24.024 --> 16:26.360
-Adoption social worker.
-If you had told me about

16:26.443 --> 16:28.404
-the adoption
in the first place--
-You didn't tell me

16:28.487 --> 16:29.488
you had a baby.

16:29.571 --> 16:31.365
Jesus Christ, Bobbi,
that's different!

16:31.448 --> 16:35.202
Of course, because it's
not really your baby, is it?

16:35.285 --> 16:37.454
This is all just one big joke.

16:37.538 --> 16:40.124
-Ha, ha, ha.
-Ha, ha, ha, fuckin' ha.

16:40.207 --> 16:41.917
Enough!

16:43.085 --> 16:45.337
We... are sorting this

16:45.421 --> 16:46.922
right now.

16:54.179 --> 16:55.889
-Absolutely not.
-Bobbi: No way.

16:58.642 --> 16:59.852
Now say it.

16:59.935 --> 17:01.478
You're unhinged.

17:02.688 --> 17:04.398
Natasha, you first.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.860
You're my sister
and I love you.

17:07.943 --> 17:10.237
Barbara:
No, say it like ya mean it.

17:13.407 --> 17:15.409
You're my sister...

17:16.660 --> 17:18.412
and I love you.

17:20.205 --> 17:21.665
Barbara:
Bobbi.

17:24.543 --> 17:26.503
You don't think I should
have a kid, do you?

17:26.587 --> 17:28.714
-Jesus, Bob.
-Do you?

17:31.633 --> 17:35.053
Don't lie. Do you think
I should have a kid?

17:37.306 --> 17:38.348
No.

17:43.228 --> 17:44.772
Why not?

17:44.855 --> 17:46.440
-Bobbi.
-Why not?

17:46.523 --> 17:47.941
'Cause this.

17:48.025 --> 17:50.611
'Cause you're
still a child.

17:50.694 --> 17:53.614
You're still terrified
of everyone leavin' you.

17:53.697 --> 17:55.657
Do you think bein'
Sam's sidekick

17:55.741 --> 17:58.619
means that she won't
eventually get bored
and fuck off?

17:59.745 --> 18:00.788
You want a baby

18:00.871 --> 18:03.415
because a baby
can't reject you.

18:03.499 --> 18:05.626
Least not for a couple
of decades anyway.

18:05.709 --> 18:07.419
So, no, Bobbi...

18:07.503 --> 18:09.338
I don't think you
should have a baby.

18:09.421 --> 18:10.964
I think you
should have a dog.

18:11.048 --> 18:13.675
It'll love you
unconditionally
and for longer.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.555
(crying)

18:20.891 --> 18:23.101
Are you for real?

18:23.185 --> 18:25.020
Someone tells you
something you don't like,

18:25.103 --> 18:27.481
and you curl up
on the floor and cry?

18:28.190 --> 18:29.483
If you have a kid,

18:29.566 --> 18:31.151
at some point
in their lives

18:31.235 --> 18:33.570
pretty early on,
I'd imagine,

18:33.654 --> 18:37.658
the world is going
to shit on them
from a great height.

18:37.741 --> 18:39.785
You're gonna have
to stand up for them.

18:39.868 --> 18:41.161
You can't even
stand up for yourself,

18:41.245 --> 18:44.081
so what chance does
a kid of yours have?

18:48.544 --> 18:51.797
Wow. Thank God for you.

18:51.880 --> 18:56.426
Natasha Williams...
the unrecognized martyr,

18:56.510 --> 18:58.512
the one who kept
everything together.

18:58.595 --> 19:01.807
We must never stop thanking you.

19:01.890 --> 19:05.352
-The fuck, Bobbi?
-What have you got...

19:05.435 --> 19:08.188
that qualifies you
to be a parent?

19:08.272 --> 19:09.940
You don't keep
everything together.

19:10.023 --> 19:12.901
You fuck everything up.

19:12.985 --> 19:17.406
And that's why everyone
is moving on without you.

19:17.489 --> 19:19.867
And it's not because
you're some maverick

19:19.950 --> 19:22.661
who's too edgy
for a normal life.

19:22.744 --> 19:26.248
It's because you
tear through people.

19:28.417 --> 19:33.881
So, what's the big plan?
Hm? What's the big plan?

19:42.055 --> 19:43.390
Right.

19:46.602 --> 19:49.479
So, why don't
you just fuck off

19:49.563 --> 19:51.940
with telling people
how to live their lives,

19:52.024 --> 19:55.611
and why don't you just
fuck off out of mine!

20:00.908 --> 20:02.743
Now...

20:02.826 --> 20:05.787
you're both
in a lot of pain.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.874
-We can heal from this.
-Don't you start.

20:08.957 --> 20:12.211
This is not about you,
Barbara, yeah?

20:12.294 --> 20:14.046
Your dad and I--

20:14.129 --> 20:16.048
Don't you say
one word about Lyle.

20:16.131 --> 20:18.634
Lyle was a fucking saint.

20:18.717 --> 20:21.845
Well, Lyle
asked me to leave.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.263
That's a lie.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.183
Why are you even saying this?

20:26.266 --> 20:29.186
I'm trying to tell
you what happened.

20:29.269 --> 20:32.189
What happened is you left.

20:35.609 --> 20:38.737
(melancholy music playing)

20:47.704 --> 20:48.622
Well...

20:51.959 --> 20:53.961
I, I was drowning.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.342
I mean, some weeks...

21:00.425 --> 21:02.636
Couldn't even
get out of bed.

21:04.513 --> 21:05.806
(chuckles)

21:07.265 --> 21:10.102
You'd bring me
crackers and butter.

21:11.186 --> 21:13.397
Probably too young
to remember.

21:14.648 --> 21:17.275
And you'd climb
into bed beside me,

21:18.652 --> 21:20.946
stroke my face.

21:22.364 --> 21:25.325
And I felt so ashamed.

21:27.285 --> 21:29.413
(melancholy music playing)

21:33.792 --> 21:36.712
And that's why
I had Bobbi.

21:36.795 --> 21:41.258
So that... you'd have
somewhere to put your love.
