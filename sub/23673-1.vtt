<i>Amira's
brought down just outside the area.</i>

00:42.172 --> 00:43.651
<i>The keeper catches it comfortably.</i>

00:44.734 --> 00:47.613
<i>It now looks like there will be
a substitution for the blues.</i>

00:47.738 --> 00:49.418
<i>Gentry replaces Penny.</i>

00:49.420 --> 00:51.900
- Take your time.
- You what?

00:52.663 --> 00:54.063
Big head on that, mate. Thank you.

00:54.065 --> 00:55.262
No problem.

00:58.188 --> 01:01.670
Oh, yeah, two weeks straight
drinking, man. What a great time.

01:01.672 --> 01:03.752
Had a great time.
Felt better when I got home.

01:03.754 --> 01:05.072
Easy.

01:05.074 --> 01:08.716
- What about... What about Ibiza?
- No, we're too old for Ibiza.

01:08.718 --> 01:11.121
What are you talking about? You're
never too old for the island, mate.

01:11.123 --> 01:14.483
That's what people who are too old
for Ibiza say. Where are the crisps?

01:14.485 --> 01:16.045
Oh, I said, "Can I have crisps
for that guy,"

01:16.047 --> 01:18.887
I pointed to you, and he said you're
not allowed to have crisps any more.

01:18.889 --> 01:20.049
Said you're only allowed salads.

01:20.051 --> 01:21.170
Fucking dickhead.

01:21.172 --> 01:22.890
It's just what he said,
Dom, I'm sorry.

01:22.892 --> 01:24.051
That's harsh, man.

01:24.053 --> 01:27.616
Why don't we go to... Boom, Amsterdam?

01:27.618 --> 01:30.859
- No, it's too touristy now, innit?
- All right, TripAdvisor.

01:30.861 --> 01:32.941
- I'm not getting off my head again.
- Tuscany?

01:32.943 --> 01:34.743
- Yeah, yeah, no, good wines.
- No.

01:34.745 --> 01:36.986
- Berlin, then?
- <i>Nein.</i>

01:36.988 --> 01:38.507
- Belgium?
- Belgium?

01:38.509 --> 01:40.510
Mate, no-one's ever been
to Belgium by choice.

01:40.512 --> 01:44.714
- What's in Belgium?
- Beers that are like 42% or something.

01:44.716 --> 01:47.196
What about hiking? Hiking in Sweden?

01:47.198 --> 01:48.756
- Hiking?
- Yeah.

01:49.520 --> 01:51.600
- Hiking.
- That's a good shout.

01:51.602 --> 01:53.321
Come on, man, let's do something good.

01:54.686 --> 01:56.966
- What's it called again?
- The King's Trail.

01:56.968 --> 01:59.288
It kind of runs up between
Sweden and Norway.

01:59.290 --> 02:00.609
You can go there in the summer.

02:00.611 --> 02:02.971
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's like
the Appalachian Trail, right?

02:02.973 --> 02:05.734
Yeah. Apart from there's more history
than hill billies.

02:05.736 --> 02:08.216
We wanna do something different.
I just don't want go to Amsterdam.

02:08.217 --> 02:10.419
You wanna mix it up.

02:10.420 --> 02:12.381
Yeah, it's not like we're 21 any more.

02:12.783 --> 02:15.104
Oh, look, there's that...
I'm gonna get a bottle.

02:15.106 --> 02:18.026
- Who's on it?
- No way. School night, mate.

02:18.028 --> 02:19.345
I wanna crack on.

02:19.509 --> 02:21.429
So no-one...
Anyone wanna come with me?

02:22.793 --> 02:24.513
- Nope.
- Come on, Robert.

02:24.515 --> 02:25.995
- Yeah, go on, then.
- Oh, man.

02:25.997 --> 02:28.397
- Bad idea.
- Anyone want any sweets or anything?

02:29.079 --> 02:30.638
You're not involved in that, are you?

02:30.640 --> 02:32.399
- I'm getting an Uber.
- Yeah, good.

02:32.644 --> 02:35.726
Don't you think that it's getting
harder now to have a good time?

02:35.728 --> 02:38.288
Do you know that Phil actually
suggested making this brunch?

02:38.728 --> 02:40.608
Fucking brunch. I'm not, I'm not,

02:40.610 --> 02:43.851
I'm not gonna plan a lads' holiday
over a fucking avocado on toast, mate.

02:43.853 --> 02:46.893
- I'm just... I'm not doing it.
- Avocado's all right.

02:47.537 --> 02:50.176
Do you really wanna go hiking?
Hiking, for fun?

02:50.542 --> 02:52.062
- Yeah.
- In fucking Sweden?

02:52.064 --> 02:53.343
Yeah, I do. I dunno,

02:53.345 --> 02:55.905
I just wanna test myself a little,
you know. A challenge.

02:55.907 --> 02:58.668
What would be a challenge is getting
Dom on the side of a mountain.

02:59.189 --> 03:00.789
Where's the vodka?

03:00.791 --> 03:04.591
Just a shame, you know. It's a shame.
It's a shame what he's become.

03:04.756 --> 03:06.516
Yeah. Yeah, big shame, yeah.

03:06.518 --> 03:09.399
Big successful businessman
with a beautiful wife and children.

03:09.401 --> 03:10.839
Yeah, no, it's a...

03:16.888 --> 03:19.168
Don't fucking argue, you cunt!

03:19.170 --> 03:21.530
There's more!
Where the fuck is it, huh?

03:21.532 --> 03:23.770
Stop fucking crying!

03:27.619 --> 03:28.976
Don't fucking move.

03:34.746 --> 03:37.265
- Give me your wallet.
- Right, give it to him.

03:37.548 --> 03:39.949
Okay, okay, it's okay.

03:39.951 --> 03:41.391
Don't just stand there, do it!

03:41.393 --> 03:42.791
Give me your fucking wallet.

03:46.315 --> 03:48.517
- What else you got?
- What else you got?

03:48.519 --> 03:50.680
Just take his watch.

03:50.682 --> 03:52.883
- Give me the fucking watch.
- All right, no problem, here.

03:52.885 --> 03:55.044
- Do it!
- Okay, all right.

03:56.327 --> 03:57.566
And the ring.

03:59.010 --> 04:01.091
No. It's my wedding ring.

04:01.093 --> 04:05.012
- We don't give a fuck!
- Just give me the fucking ring.

04:05.337 --> 04:08.298
- Just take it off him!
- No. Look, you've done enough.

04:08.300 --> 04:09.899
It... Just leave.

04:09.901 --> 04:11.978
Take it the fuck off him!

04:13.344 --> 04:14.782
Come on.

04:14.784 --> 04:18.185
Listen, you take that ring off
or I will fuck you up!

04:24.275 --> 04:26.155
Look, I'm not...

04:29.039 --> 04:31.918
Oh, fuck!
Mate, what are you doing?

04:32.285 --> 04:33.523
I told you.

04:34.245 --> 04:36.084
Fucking hell, mate!

04:36.368 --> 04:37.567
What are you doing?

04:37.569 --> 04:38.846
It's all right.

04:39.411 --> 04:41.971
- For fuck's sake. Leave it.
- Right, let's go, let's go!

06:08.221 --> 06:09.578
Morning.

06:10.062 --> 06:11.459
Fuck me, it's cold.

06:13.185 --> 06:14.423
I'll get the coffees on.

06:20.152 --> 06:21.552
- Morning, bud.
- Morning.

06:21.554 --> 06:24.114
How did you sleep?

06:24.797 --> 06:27.155
Like I'd just walked up
a big fucking mountain, man.

06:27.400 --> 06:29.517
One night down, two to go, mate.

06:44.898 --> 06:46.617
Makes you feel insignificant, right?

06:46.778 --> 06:49.617
- Speak for yourself.
- Come on, man, where's your soul?

06:49.902 --> 06:54.224
These mountains were smashed out by
Nordic gods with big bastard hammers.

06:54.267 --> 06:56.466
You know what they have
on walking trails in England?

06:57.548 --> 06:59.626
- Pubs.
- Yeah, whatever.

07:01.273 --> 07:02.792
Don't tell me you're not impressed.

07:11.443 --> 07:14.165
Yeah, yeah, these are new boots.
Reduced to 200 quid.

07:14.525 --> 07:17.124
- Memory foam as well.
- But you still need to break them in.

07:17.288 --> 07:18.767
Yeah, definitely.

07:19.411 --> 07:21.251
It's just basic common sense, Phil.

07:23.096 --> 07:24.774
Okay, I think I've found a spot.

07:25.738 --> 07:27.015
Just up the top of that hill.

08:03.335 --> 08:05.375
- Fuck me.
- It's beautiful.

08:09.500 --> 08:11.699
Jesus... Christ!

08:12.425 --> 08:14.184
Oh, fuck every hill in the world.

08:14.426 --> 08:15.665
Shall we do this?

08:23.954 --> 08:27.755
- Bo will be up there waiting for him.
- Man, I hated that dog.

08:30.202 --> 08:31.400
He was a good man.

08:33.325 --> 08:34.523
The best of us.

08:37.128 --> 08:38.525
It should never have happened.

08:45.497 --> 08:47.495
It should never have happened
but it did...

08:50.183 --> 08:52.541
And all we can do is remember him.

09:48.161 --> 09:50.399
Robert, we miss you, mate.

10:09.180 --> 10:10.382
We haven't seen her.

10:10.384 --> 10:12.104
I can't remember
the last time I saw her.

10:12.106 --> 10:13.745
Yeah, I mean,
she mentioned Gayle.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.547
Yeah, well, they get on.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.693
Rob would have loved this place.

10:43.737 --> 10:45.456
Except we wouldn't be here, though,
would we?

10:45.618 --> 10:50.179
We'd be on some terrible lads' holiday
that he would have hated.

10:51.265 --> 10:54.066
I've said it before, I don't care what
anyone says,

10:54.068 --> 10:55.426
it wasn't your fault, mate.

11:02.756 --> 11:04.955
- Fucking hell, is that the lodge?
- I think it is, yeah.

11:05.078 --> 11:07.158
Ah. I thought we were
further out than that.

11:07.160 --> 11:08.358
Uh-uh.

11:10.442 --> 11:13.402
When we get back I was thinking
I might stop on a few days.

11:13.886 --> 11:16.005
Maybe get out there,
do a little bit more hiking.

11:16.407 --> 11:19.050
- What do you think, man?
- I dunno, mate.

11:19.052 --> 11:20.972
Come all this way,
we gotta make the most of it.

11:20.974 --> 11:23.574
No, I think this is enough for me.

11:29.823 --> 11:32.265
What are you doing, man?
Here, give it here.

11:32.267 --> 11:35.346
You've done it the wrong way round.
Give it here. Unclip the pole.

11:35.348 --> 11:36.827
Christ!

11:46.279 --> 11:49.359
Oh, this is awful
in almost every conceivable way.

11:49.764 --> 11:52.844
There are some, Phil,
who consider this character building.

11:53.167 --> 11:56.326
Quite frankly, right now,
Sweden can lick my bridge.

11:56.528 --> 11:58.570
- Lick your what?
- My bridge.

11:58.572 --> 12:00.852
- Jesus Christ, the bridge.
- Oh, you mean the perineum.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.814
- Yeah, the gooch. The bridge.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:04.019 --> 12:05.536
Argh!

12:06.378 --> 12:07.577
Fuck!

12:09.343 --> 12:11.421
- Come on, let's get you up.
- Argh!

12:11.507 --> 12:12.905
Fuck, shit!

12:12.907 --> 12:14.943
All right, come on. Easy, easy.

12:16.470 --> 12:18.591
- Come on, mate, you're all right.
- Up, up, up.

12:18.593 --> 12:19.991
Yeah, all right, easy.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.475
- Oh, fuck.
- Walk about a bit on it.

12:23.477 --> 12:25.635
- Argh!
- Give it a walk around.

12:26.159 --> 12:27.397
That's it.

12:28.843 --> 12:30.081
You're okay.

12:30.564 --> 12:33.884
Argh! No, it's twisted. It's twisted.

12:33.886 --> 12:37.247
- Can you put your full weight on it?
- Hurts like a son of a bitch.

12:38.611 --> 12:40.250
You could probably walk it off,
couldn't you?

12:40.252 --> 12:42.853
No, no, it's my meniscus.
I've done it before, it's fucked.

12:42.855 --> 12:46.857
We'll get him something to lean on.
Phil, can you get the rods, please?

12:49.624 --> 12:50.901
What we thinking, Dom?

12:51.426 --> 12:54.626
'Cause the trail goes right round
those mountains there,

12:54.628 --> 12:57.108
and it's probably, what,
six hours till we camp?

12:57.110 --> 12:58.790
Another eight round to the lodge.

12:59.514 --> 13:00.833
What we thinking?

13:01.435 --> 13:02.672
Fuck me.

13:03.156 --> 13:05.876
I'm not doing 14 hours on this.
Okay, man?

13:06.680 --> 13:07.879
Let's get the map.

13:08.122 --> 13:10.962
- Wanna try your phone as well?
- No, no need.

13:11.126 --> 13:13.725
- Well, there's no reception anyway.
- Cheers, man.

13:14.006 --> 13:15.605
Luke, my office.

13:20.616 --> 13:21.892
What do you think?

13:21.975 --> 13:23.734
I think we could be carrying him out

13:23.736 --> 13:25.898
of here like
a fucking Egyptian princess

13:25.900 --> 13:28.620
- if we're not careful.
- Probably not as bad as he says it is.

13:28.622 --> 13:30.541
Almost certainly not as bad
as he says it is,

13:30.543 --> 13:32.863
but it's not gonna stop him moaning
the whole way back, is it?

13:38.153 --> 13:39.592
There is another way out of this, man.

13:39.594 --> 13:40.671
What?

13:40.673 --> 13:43.353
Well, you saw it last night.
The lodge.

13:43.677 --> 13:47.718
It's not that far as the crow flies.
Look, if we go south-west,

13:47.720 --> 13:49.958
through here,
we cut the journey in half.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.323
- What, through the forest?
- Yeah, why not?

13:54.047 --> 13:55.687
Little off-trail hiking.

13:55.689 --> 13:57.968
Could be exciting.
Might even do us some good.

13:58.411 --> 14:00.250
We could be kicking back
by the evening time.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.018
I think we need this.

14:06.781 --> 14:08.860
Look, why don't me and you
leave them here with the food

14:08.862 --> 14:10.941
and then we can go back,
get some help?

14:10.943 --> 14:13.664
No fucking way you're leaving us
on this fucking mountain.

14:13.788 --> 14:15.786
I can walk. All right?

14:16.189 --> 14:17.788
If you know a quicker route,
let's do it.

14:35.570 --> 14:39.451
- How's the knee, Dom-Dom?
- Killing me. How's your mum?

14:39.453 --> 14:40.971
Unnecessary, innit?

14:43.497 --> 14:46.457
- Are there bears in this forest?
- Course there's fucking bears.

14:46.459 --> 14:47.856
Big bastards as well.

14:47.903 --> 14:49.461
Should have gone to Vegas.

14:49.463 --> 14:51.984
You'd have found something
to fall over in Vegas, too.

14:51.986 --> 14:54.264
Yeah, a massive pile of tits.

14:57.032 --> 14:58.470
Shithouse.

15:00.355 --> 15:02.915
Everything in this bastard country
is a relic.

15:03.197 --> 15:04.796
Strange place to park, innit?

15:05.761 --> 15:07.439
My next door neighbour's
got one of those.

15:07.880 --> 15:10.960
My eldest is absolutely
obsessed by it.

15:11.526 --> 15:13.966
I got a hand job in one of those once,
at a festival.

15:14.249 --> 15:16.168
Thanks, Phil. What a beautiful story.

15:16.969 --> 15:20.330
- We sure this is a good idea?
- What's up? You scared of the woods?

15:49.563 --> 15:52.603
Now, is it me
or is it really quiet in here?

15:52.647 --> 15:55.806
All right, don't shit your pants.
The trees soak up the sound.

15:55.808 --> 15:57.330
That's what trees do.

15:57.332 --> 15:58.931
Hiking was easier yesterday.

15:58.933 --> 16:00.652
We weren't
in the forest yesterday.

16:00.654 --> 16:01.934
No, we bloody weren't.

16:01.936 --> 16:03.856
The sooner we get going,
the sooner we get to the town,

16:03.858 --> 16:05.856
the sooner we get to the bar,
the sooner we get drunk.

16:07.502 --> 16:10.782
The Swedes were big into logging,
until the 1950s.

16:10.825 --> 16:13.067
- Then they decided to pack it in.
- That's interesting.

16:13.069 --> 16:17.389
Which is why Sweden is
an untouched land of natural beauty

16:17.511 --> 16:19.030
and Britain is a car park.

16:19.193 --> 16:21.713
If you love Sweden so much,
why don't you marry it?

16:24.838 --> 16:26.116
Right, time out.

16:26.399 --> 16:27.762
Dom, what did Gayle say

16:27.764 --> 16:29.642
when you told her you were
going on a hiking holiday?

16:29.644 --> 16:32.003
She said, "Who are you?
What have you done with my husband?"

16:35.890 --> 16:37.570
Oh, here we go, photo op.

16:38.613 --> 16:40.895
- Here we go.
- Scott of the Antarctic.

16:40.897 --> 16:44.295
- Fucking Amelia Earhart over there.
- Wallop.

16:44.297 --> 16:46.737
Yes, that's it.
Let's get a selfie while we're here.

16:46.902 --> 16:49.861
- Selfie? Really?
- You too, Luke, come on.

16:50.505 --> 16:53.664
- Let's preserve this magic moment.
- It's a beautiful thing.

16:53.747 --> 16:54.866
Here we go.

16:54.868 --> 16:57.912
Everyone get in.
One, two, three, and Brexit.

16:57.914 --> 16:59.272
Boom.

16:59.914 --> 17:02.313
- Yes.
- Yeah, yeah, four twats in a forest.

17:03.558 --> 17:04.915
Yeah.

17:41.155 --> 17:43.635
My stomach is beginning to eat itself.

17:43.677 --> 17:45.356
Yeah, I could do a steak.

17:47.242 --> 17:49.721
Big fat, juicy steak.

17:50.445 --> 17:53.206
One peppercorn sauce,
one hand-cooked chips.

17:53.607 --> 17:56.807
Side salad. Nice tumbler of Scotch.

17:57.091 --> 17:59.652
And a big fat cigar at the end.

17:59.654 --> 18:02.294
Ah, man, I could go for some
sushi right now.

18:03.378 --> 18:06.418
Yeah, some red wine instead of white.

18:06.862 --> 18:08.219
Lashings of wasabi.

18:08.503 --> 18:12.944
Big Mac, plastic tray, by myself,
no-one to talk to.

18:13.308 --> 18:15.468
- Can I have a kebab, please, mate?
- Donner?

18:15.751 --> 18:17.391
No, chicken shish, please.

18:18.594 --> 18:21.073
Rob liked a donner. You remember that?

18:22.116 --> 18:23.354
Yeah.

18:23.639 --> 18:25.318
Every Saturday night at uni.

18:25.601 --> 18:28.800
There he was, pissed,
covered in grease.

18:34.970 --> 18:36.208
What the fuck?

18:40.415 --> 18:41.653
What the fuck is it?

18:52.868 --> 18:55.827
- Why is it ripped open?
- It's been gutted.

18:57.351 --> 18:59.151
Yeah, but why hang it like that?

18:59.956 --> 19:01.514
I mean, would someone do that?

19:01.997 --> 19:04.196
Well, it didn't fucking
put itself there, that's for sure.

19:04.479 --> 19:06.476
- Could be hunters out here.
- What, bait?

19:06.922 --> 19:08.160
Possibly.

19:08.644 --> 19:10.963
Or it's the bit they don't show you
in the nature documentaries.

19:10.965 --> 19:12.243
What could do that, though?

19:12.368 --> 19:14.008
- A bear.
- Do bears do that?

19:14.010 --> 19:16.047
I don't know, Dominic,
I'm not a fucking bear expert.

19:20.615 --> 19:22.653
- It's still bleeding.
- So?

19:22.819 --> 19:26.738
So it means that whatever did that,
we should go. It's a fresh kill.

19:28.304 --> 19:29.823
Yeah, we should go.

20:13.389 --> 20:15.707
Fucking Jesus Christ!

20:17.313 --> 20:18.752
Fuck.

20:19.394 --> 20:22.313
- Where the hell are we, Hutch?
- Let me check.

20:23.879 --> 20:25.358
This is ridiculous, man.

20:27.402 --> 20:29.641
- We should pitch the tents.
- What?

20:29.766 --> 20:31.366
We should pitch the tents!

20:31.368 --> 20:33.606
So we're giving up
making it back to town tonight, then?

20:33.608 --> 20:36.127
I don't see
we have much choice, Philip.

20:38.615 --> 20:39.813
Guys.

20:41.456 --> 20:43.856
- What is it? What is it?
- Look at this.

20:44.259 --> 20:45.616
- Huh?
- Look.

20:57.153 --> 20:59.793
- Well, how about that?
- What is that?

21:00.557 --> 21:01.794
Is that a house?

21:03.039 --> 21:04.959
- Come on.
- Thank Christ.

21:09.004 --> 21:11.563
- Hey, Hutch. Wait a minute!
- Come on!

21:20.297 --> 21:23.535
- Can you see anything?
- It looks empty!

21:23.660 --> 21:25.179
We should leave it alone, then.

21:26.262 --> 21:29.343
- Let's kick it in.
- No fucking way.

21:29.345 --> 21:31.105
We need to get undercover, mate.

21:31.107 --> 21:33.346
- Phil, give us a hand.
- All right, come on, then.

21:35.151 --> 21:37.473
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
We can't just break in.

21:37.475 --> 21:39.395
We can't stay out here all night.

21:39.675 --> 21:40.873
On three, yeah?

21:41.157 --> 21:43.077
One, two, three.

22:10.505 --> 22:12.865
- Luke, you're getting soaked.
- Did you hear that?

22:13.070 --> 22:15.030
No, I didn't hear anything. Come on.

22:25.282 --> 22:27.442
This is clearly the house
we'll get murdered in.

22:27.444 --> 22:30.002
It's not as bad as
our uni accommodation.

22:34.691 --> 22:36.289
That's the shape on the tree, I think.

22:39.656 --> 22:42.136
Guys, this place is definitely
abandoned, yeah?

22:42.459 --> 22:44.178
Abandoned? Who'd have moved in?

22:45.261 --> 22:48.140
Whoever it was,
they were packing. Look at that.

22:49.546 --> 22:52.546
- I don't like this place.
- Not too keen on it myself, mate,

22:52.548 --> 22:55.547
but it's a lesser-of-two-evils
kind of situation.

22:55.832 --> 22:59.313
Hutch. I definitely
just heard something outside.

22:59.315 --> 23:00.916
Well, maybe you did, Lukey.

23:00.918 --> 23:02.477
We're not the only animals
in the woods.

23:04.402 --> 23:06.679
Right, let's see
if we can get this stove working.

23:06.681 --> 23:08.240
We'll need stuff to burn.

23:08.805 --> 23:11.926
- Like what?
- Anything made of wood'll do.

23:17.372 --> 23:19.450
We're gonna smash the place up,
are we?

23:20.296 --> 23:23.255
- And what if the homeowners come back?
- Fuck 'em.

23:23.380 --> 23:24.820
Anyone who lives here
has more to worry

23:24.822 --> 23:26.540
about than their table being on fire.

23:27.343 --> 23:29.022
Might be some stuff to burn up there.

23:29.705 --> 23:31.103
Go on, Phil, you're nearest.

23:31.829 --> 23:33.588
- What?
- Go on.

23:34.431 --> 23:36.749
- Do you want me to come with you?
- No.

24:06.062 --> 24:09.985
Wa-hey, that's it, lad!

24:11.749 --> 24:12.947
Dickheads.

24:54.591 --> 24:56.668
Guys, get the fuck up here right now!

24:56.912 --> 24:58.110
What now?

25:07.044 --> 25:08.282
Oh, shit.

25:12.009 --> 25:13.287
Oh, my God.

25:16.493 --> 25:17.770
What the fuck is that?

25:24.581 --> 25:26.579
- That's witchcraft.
- Huh?

25:26.985 --> 25:28.504
That's what that is,
that's witchcraft.

25:29.426 --> 25:31.105
Is that meant to be a person?

25:31.709 --> 25:33.747
What, with no head
and antlers for hands?

25:34.832 --> 25:36.551
If I hear anything
coming down the stairs...

25:36.553 --> 25:38.792
Don't. Fucking hell!

25:42.239 --> 25:44.960
I'm going downstairs
to get that fire started.

25:45.323 --> 25:46.921
You guys can stay up here if you want.

25:48.525 --> 25:50.723
- Yep. Good idea.
- Come on.

26:10.868 --> 26:12.668
Looked like that fucking thing
in the tree.

26:12.871 --> 26:16.150
Could be idolising
a spirit or a deity.

26:16.314 --> 26:19.633
Some kind of pagan or Nordic shit.

26:20.158 --> 26:21.396
Like an offering or something.

26:21.798 --> 26:24.717
Yeah, well, I almost offered up
a massive shit when I saw it.

26:25.042 --> 26:27.840
- I thought they worshipped Odin.
- Well, that is Nordic.

26:28.366 --> 26:32.607
Who knows what they're into out here?
Living here, in the middle of nowhere.

26:32.929 --> 26:35.050
Sun goes down,
don't come up for six months.

26:35.052 --> 26:37.210
You're bound to go fucking mental
in the winter.

26:38.215 --> 26:40.213
We should probably burn this place
down when we leave.

26:40.737 --> 26:43.377
Fucking well up for burning it down.

26:44.222 --> 26:45.981
Listen, though, I think that, um,

26:47.262 --> 26:48.620
when we wake up tomorrow,

26:48.945 --> 26:51.224
we should think about just going
back out the way we came.

26:51.550 --> 26:54.790
We don't need to wilfully add
another day to the trip, do we?

26:54.792 --> 26:58.473
- Let's just stick to the shortcut...
- My old scoutmaster used to say

26:58.475 --> 27:01.557
"If the shortcut was a shortcut,
it would be called a route."

27:01.559 --> 27:04.240
Why pretend you were in the Scouts?
You were never in the Scouts.

27:04.242 --> 27:05.800
Where did I get the quote from, then?

27:05.802 --> 27:08.563
Guys, right, we have a map,
we have a compass,

27:08.565 --> 27:09.883
we have supplies.

27:10.249 --> 27:13.368
So as long as we don't panic,
as long as we don't fuck ourselves

27:13.370 --> 27:15.530
- we're gonna be absolutely okay.
- No-one's fucking anyone.

27:15.532 --> 27:19.414
- Who knows? It could be a long night.
- No-one's fucking anybody.

27:21.378 --> 27:23.376
We're in sleeping bags,
for crying out loud.

27:23.942 --> 27:25.298
It could get messy.

27:27.947 --> 27:31.187
I'll give any of you a grand to go
upstairs and sleep with that thing.

27:31.549 --> 27:33.068
Absolutely no way.

27:33.353 --> 27:35.591
- My wife would never forgive me.
- No, she wouldn't.

27:35.672 --> 27:37.873
- Good night.
- Yeah, all right, okay.

27:37.875 --> 27:40.675
Couple of hours, soon as it's light,
we'll get out.

28:59.076 --> 29:00.595
Hutch.

30:15.512 --> 30:19.311
Hutch?

30:19.917 --> 30:21.237
Hutch?

30:21.239 --> 30:22.400
Mate, wake up.

30:22.402 --> 30:25.042
Mate. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

30:25.283 --> 30:27.363
- Where the fuck am I?
- We're in that house.

30:27.365 --> 30:28.924
We're in that fucking house, okay?

30:28.926 --> 30:30.924
Get up, okay? Get up.

30:32.451 --> 30:34.930
Where's the... Where's my fucking...

30:41.700 --> 30:43.139
Jesus Christ.

30:43.263 --> 30:44.902
I've pissed myself.

30:45.024 --> 30:47.224
Gayle.

30:47.226 --> 30:48.664
Dom?

30:49.387 --> 30:51.066
Gayle!

30:51.709 --> 30:53.148
Dom.

30:53.313 --> 30:54.670
Dom!

30:55.834 --> 30:58.514
- Gayle!
- Wake up. Mate, mate, it's okay.

31:00.359 --> 31:01.716
Get up, mate.

31:03.842 --> 31:05.160
Wake up.

31:05.603 --> 31:06.683
Where's Phil?

31:06.685 --> 31:09.244
Where the fuck's...

31:20.740 --> 31:22.177
Oh, fuck.

31:22.179 --> 31:23.497
Phil.

31:26.306 --> 31:27.544
Fuck!

31:29.428 --> 31:32.549
Phil. Phil, what are you doing?

31:33.433 --> 31:35.912
Phil, what are you doing?

31:36.395 --> 31:39.355
It's okay.

31:39.357 --> 31:41.998
It's okay. Mate, get up, okay?

31:44.324 --> 31:46.083
What's this? What's this?

31:46.203 --> 31:47.802
I don't know. I don't know, mate.

31:51.971 --> 31:53.249
Get up, okay?

32:12.271 --> 32:15.751
Just grab everything.
Just shove it in the bags, let's go.

32:23.601 --> 32:24.999
Can we fucking hurry up, yeah?

32:26.006 --> 32:27.283
I want to get out of here now!

32:44.504 --> 32:46.541
Oh, for fuck's sake.

32:47.065 --> 32:49.304
- We shouldn't be here.
- It's a warning.

32:50.510 --> 32:52.588
No, we don't know that.
We do not know that.

32:52.590 --> 32:54.628
- It's a warning.
- Fuck!

32:59.678 --> 33:00.955
Listen.

33:01.481 --> 33:04.403
Hutch, we just go out
the way we came in, okay?

33:04.405 --> 33:07.045
- We go north-east.
- It's a knee-jerk plan.

33:07.047 --> 33:08.526
- Guys.
- It's a bad plan.

33:08.528 --> 33:09.967
- Mate.
- Hey!

33:09.969 --> 33:11.206
Hey!

33:11.609 --> 33:12.769
Is that a path?

33:12.771 --> 33:15.412
No, Dom, south-west is this way, mate.

33:15.414 --> 33:17.013
South-west can go and fuck itself.

33:17.015 --> 33:19.377
You said we were
getting out of this forest yesterday.

33:19.379 --> 33:21.458
The storm slowed us down.
What do you want?

33:21.460 --> 33:23.299
So did the dead thing hanging
in the trees

33:23.301 --> 33:25.142
and the spooky fucking house!

33:26.025 --> 33:27.703
Um, can we go?

33:27.705 --> 33:29.423
We don't even know where that goes.

33:29.587 --> 33:31.788
We could end up in Norway
for all we know.

33:31.790 --> 33:36.593
Great! You know, I'm sick of this
off-road bollocks. Okay?

33:37.116 --> 33:39.394
A path means civilisation.

33:42.481 --> 33:43.679
Dom.

33:46.687 --> 33:47.925
Marvellous.

34:21.039 --> 34:22.717
So are we gonna talk about it, then,
or not?

34:23.842 --> 34:25.362
Because I'd really like
to talk about it.

34:25.364 --> 34:28.164
- I'd rather not, mate.
- You'd rather not?

34:28.286 --> 34:30.808
I woke up stark bollock naked
in front of that thing,

34:30.810 --> 34:33.251
praying to it, and I'd love someone
to explain it to me.

34:33.253 --> 34:36.295
It was a nightmare, Phil.
What's commonly known as a nightmare.

34:36.297 --> 34:40.777
- What happened to you, then, mate?
- We all did. We all had nightmares.

34:40.859 --> 34:43.982
We got spooked and we had bad dreams.

34:43.984 --> 34:46.583
- All right?
- Yeah. Leave it out, mate.

34:46.585 --> 34:50.228
Hang on, mate. You were screaming
and shouting at the top of your voice.

34:50.230 --> 34:51.627
You were shouting "Gayle!"

34:51.791 --> 34:54.471
- Have you ever done that before?
- I said leave it out, Luke.

34:54.994 --> 34:57.714
- Something made me do that.
- Press on.

34:57.716 --> 35:00.998
Bad dreams or not, I'd never have done
that. Something was in that house.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.601
For fuck's sake, Phil!
Listen to yourself, mate.

35:04.484 --> 35:06.043
I'm a bit fucking humiliated

35:06.045 --> 35:08.364
about being found in my kegs
covered in piss.

35:08.447 --> 35:10.809
All right?
I don't really wanna psychoanalyse it.

35:10.811 --> 35:13.730
I don't wanna play fucking
make-believe because, right now,

35:13.813 --> 35:16.134
we have some real fucking problems.

35:16.136 --> 35:19.458
Like finding out which way
this fucking path ends up.

35:19.460 --> 35:22.020
Enough of the bullshit
ghost stories, okay?

35:22.143 --> 35:23.822
You're starting to sound like
my daughters.

35:27.066 --> 35:28.665
Outside I'd never
have done that, mate.

35:31.592 --> 35:33.150
Something's not right here.

35:44.803 --> 35:46.365
- Did you say south-west, yeah?
- Yes.

35:46.367 --> 35:48.686
- Which way is south-west?
- That ridge up there.

35:49.490 --> 35:53.328
- What, towards the light?
- Yeah. We're just tracking along it.

35:55.094 --> 35:57.774
Five more minutes on this path
and I'm pulling rank.

36:01.302 --> 36:04.062
You see these things? Man-made.

36:04.823 --> 36:06.221
We're getting somewhere.

36:20.882 --> 36:24.681
- Should we have a look?
- Absolutely not.

36:25.406 --> 36:27.124
- Let's keep going.
- Yep.

36:27.406 --> 36:29.286
We can still get out of here today.

36:32.333 --> 36:33.611
Dom...

36:35.856 --> 36:37.736
Dom, maybe we should think about this.

36:38.579 --> 36:39.857
Dom.

37:02.522 --> 37:05.043
Guys, I just need a minute.

37:07.408 --> 37:08.646
My knee's killing me.

37:10.450 --> 37:12.447
These are the wrong fucking shoes.

37:15.296 --> 37:20.097
Er, Dom, you might have to push
through the pain barrier a bit, mate.

37:20.900 --> 37:23.941
- We can't keep going at this pace.
- Screw you.

37:24.625 --> 37:27.226
I'm through the pain barrier.
I'm in bloody agony.

37:27.228 --> 37:30.106
No. I think you're uncomfortable.
There's a difference.

37:30.189 --> 37:32.792
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't realise you were a doctor.

37:32.794 --> 37:35.955
Go give yourself a fucking prostate
exam and leave me in peace, yeah?

37:35.957 --> 37:38.236
Dom, come on, get up.

37:39.599 --> 37:40.837
No.

37:41.282 --> 37:43.442
Dom, I want out of these woods now.

37:43.444 --> 37:45.162
Please get up.

37:45.646 --> 37:48.127
This is fucking ridiculous.

37:49.609 --> 37:52.209
I'm gonna go to the top of that ridge,
see if I can see anything.

37:52.332 --> 37:54.371
Yeah. Yeah, good idea, man.

37:54.734 --> 37:56.812
- To the ridge, straight back.
- Got it.

37:56.897 --> 37:58.656
- Don't go too far.
- Yeah, got it!

38:59.921 --> 39:01.159
Fuck!

39:47.929 --> 39:49.247
Guys!

39:50.052 --> 39:51.851
- Everything okay?
- There's something up there.

39:51.853 --> 39:53.011
What are you talking about?

39:53.013 --> 39:55.574
- There's something in those woods.
- What do you mean?

39:55.576 --> 39:58.297
- Something fucking big.
- Like an animal? What?

39:58.299 --> 39:59.980
Can we not do this, please?

39:59.982 --> 40:03.021
Can we all agree to not start
losing our fucking shit in here?

40:03.023 --> 40:05.224
- There is fucking something up there.
- Shut up.

40:05.226 --> 40:07.427
Okay, listen, I'm not trying
to fucking freak you out

40:07.429 --> 40:10.308
but I woke up last night
and there was some fucking...

40:10.392 --> 40:11.911
And look at this.

40:12.833 --> 40:15.513
- What...
- What the fuck is that?

40:17.237 --> 40:19.477
Nothing has done that to you. You...

40:20.922 --> 40:22.640
You're on your own.
You've done it to yourself.

40:22.642 --> 40:25.606
- I fucking what?
- You walked into a fucking tree.

40:25.608 --> 40:27.646
Why do you have to fucking deny
everything I say?

40:27.648 --> 40:30.647
Because I do not value
your judgement, Luke.

40:31.014 --> 40:33.813
And I wanna get the fuck out of here.

40:33.815 --> 40:35.775
Listen, mate, we wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you!

40:35.777 --> 40:38.498
No, we wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you!

40:38.500 --> 40:39.937
Dom, shut up.

40:45.988 --> 40:48.146
Come on, what do you mean by that?

40:52.393 --> 40:53.671
Track it back.

40:55.757 --> 40:58.639
- You know what I'm talking about.
- No. No, I don't.

40:58.641 --> 41:01.120
I don't, no. Why don't you just, er...

41:01.923 --> 41:05.162
- Fucking come out and say it?
- Come on, guys. This is bullshit!

41:05.406 --> 41:07.525
- Come on, mate.
- Now there it is!

41:07.808 --> 41:10.328
Now he's got some fucking
fight in him, yeah?

41:11.371 --> 41:13.131
Well, where was that with Rob?

41:14.376 --> 41:16.416
You fight your friends,
you can't stand up for them.

41:16.418 --> 41:19.178
You are not my
fucking friend any more.

41:19.180 --> 41:20.259
No, I am not.

41:20.261 --> 41:22.783
- No, you're fucking not.
- Oh, for fuck's sake, guys.

41:22.785 --> 41:24.623
No, you are fucking not. Okay?

41:24.625 --> 41:26.465
Do you know what?
I am fucking done with you.

41:29.550 --> 41:31.149
Not a drop of blood on you.

41:32.032 --> 41:33.470
Fucking coward.

41:35.436 --> 41:37.798
- What?
- Dom, will you shut the fuck up.

41:37.800 --> 41:40.599
No, hang on, Hutch, mate.
Hang on. Hang on. What?

41:41.683 --> 41:43.001
Fucking what?

41:43.205 --> 41:45.403
He has his skull cracked in half

41:45.687 --> 41:47.368
and you come out of there

41:47.370 --> 41:49.209
without a drop of blood on you. Argh!

41:49.211 --> 41:52.292
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Dom, are you all right, mate?

41:52.294 --> 41:54.854
- He's broken my nose!
- Shut up.

41:54.856 --> 41:58.415
You've not broken your nose,
all right? Don't start your shit now.

41:58.618 --> 42:01.058
You keep quiet if you want,
but somebody's got to say something.

42:11.153 --> 42:13.593
This is exactly the kind of situation

42:13.595 --> 42:16.158
where people fall out
and we need to be...

42:16.160 --> 42:19.439
Where you going?
We need to be working together, man!

42:21.962 --> 42:24.040
Luke. Fucking hell. Luke.

42:25.007 --> 42:26.205
Luke.

42:26.528 --> 42:29.969
Is that what you think? Eh?
That it was my fault?

42:31.372 --> 42:32.770
That I should have stood up?

42:35.658 --> 42:37.095
I don't know.

43:22.505 --> 43:23.862
Looks like someone was here.

43:25.589 --> 43:26.906
Are we stopping?

43:29.592 --> 43:30.870
What the fuck is that?

43:33.675 --> 43:37.235
Yeah, what is that, man?
Some sort of fabric, I think.

43:45.286 --> 43:47.966
I think
it's a tent or something.

44:12.553 --> 44:13.831
It's a credit card.

44:14.236 --> 44:16.516
Anna Eriksen. Expires 1984.

44:17.278 --> 44:18.876
That's a bad sign, isn't it?

44:19.401 --> 44:22.640
Just leaving your tent behind
and your shoes?

44:25.286 --> 44:28.847
Guys. Guys, seriously, come on.

44:28.891 --> 44:31.049
We're not gonna be these people,
right? Okay?

44:31.294 --> 44:34.134
Because we registered at the lodge.

44:34.136 --> 44:37.297
And in five hours' time,
five hours' time,

44:37.299 --> 44:39.018
they are gonna report us missing.

44:39.221 --> 44:42.701
We're on a path in the woods.
It's near a hiking trail.

44:43.385 --> 44:45.504
This is where people get found, right?

44:47.871 --> 44:49.188
It's getting dark again.

45:35.918 --> 45:37.397
Oh, thanks.

45:37.599 --> 45:39.077
Thank you. Thank you.

45:40.403 --> 45:41.681
How are you doing?

45:42.526 --> 45:44.085
I'm looking forward
to the rescue party.

45:53.257 --> 45:55.136
Dom's knee is getting worse,
not better.

45:57.259 --> 45:58.697
Phil's not looking great.

46:07.070 --> 46:10.350
You're the strongest.
You should try and get out, get help.

46:10.833 --> 46:12.191
I'll stay with these two.

46:14.157 --> 46:17.356
- You think so?
- Definitely.

46:20.362 --> 46:21.841
I'll get you fixed up in the morning.

46:22.285 --> 46:24.845
- Take the compass, head south-west.
- Okay.

46:25.210 --> 46:26.688
- Keep south-west.
- Okay.

46:28.771 --> 46:30.651
- Good man, mate.
- Yeah.

46:33.456 --> 46:34.694
How are we doing here, mate?

46:35.459 --> 46:36.856
Let's have a look at this.

46:37.018 --> 46:39.300
Ooh, looks nasty, that, man.

46:41.143 --> 46:42.382
Yeah, it's not good.

46:42.384 --> 46:45.184
- Have you put anything on it?
- No, I haven't got anything.

46:45.827 --> 46:48.587
Maybe Dom's got
something in his backpack.

46:48.589 --> 46:49.711
Fucking shoes.

46:49.713 --> 46:50.951
That looks grim.

48:59.842 --> 49:01.080
Phil, Phil!

49:01.967 --> 49:03.925
- Phil, Phil, Phil!
- It was here.

49:10.654 --> 49:12.573
- Where's Hutch?
- I don't know, man.

49:12.734 --> 49:14.777
- Where's Hutch?
- All I saw was shadows.

49:14.779 --> 49:16.377
- What?
- I don't know!

49:16.379 --> 49:18.340
It just... It took him.

49:18.502 --> 49:19.622
Hutch?

49:19.624 --> 49:21.342
Hutch!

49:22.905 --> 49:25.106
- Get up, Hutch has gone.
- What?

49:25.108 --> 49:26.347
Hutch has gone!

49:34.998 --> 49:36.959
Oh, fuck.

49:40.363 --> 49:42.603
- What we gonna do?
- I don't know.

49:44.610 --> 49:45.848
Hutch?

49:47.610 --> 49:48.928
Hutch!

49:50.574 --> 49:52.253
- Hutch!
- Luke...

49:53.138 --> 49:54.376
Hutch!

49:57.660 --> 50:00.383
Luke, we're getting turned around
out here.

50:00.385 --> 50:04.184
- Hutch!
- We should try and retrace our steps.

50:04.749 --> 50:06.348
Everything we have
is in the tents, Luke.

50:06.350 --> 50:07.869
- He's fucking screaming.
- I know.

50:07.871 --> 50:11.472
But if we run around in circles,
we're gonna get fucking lost. Okay?

50:11.474 --> 50:14.235
We need to get back to the camp
and get our bearings. Yeah?

50:15.559 --> 50:17.717
Fuck... Fuck.

50:21.165 --> 50:22.924
We'll find the tents
and come back for him.

51:44.689 --> 51:45.967
Is that...

51:48.013 --> 51:49.291
Is that Hutch?

52:00.905 --> 52:02.423
Oh, my God!

52:17.121 --> 52:18.319
Oh, fuck.

52:20.525 --> 52:21.763
Come on!

52:21.765 --> 52:23.324
- Did he have the map?
- No.

52:23.888 --> 52:25.848
- What are we gonna tell Catherine?
- I don't know.

52:25.850 --> 52:29.212
- What about his kids?
- Listen, okay? Just calm down.

52:29.214 --> 52:31.934
We need to get out of here, now.
We need to move.

52:31.936 --> 52:33.294
We can't leave him here.

52:34.017 --> 52:36.136
We can't bury him. Okay?

52:36.461 --> 52:38.501
We'll send people to come and get him.

52:38.503 --> 52:40.580
Fucking hell,
we don't know where we are.

52:41.225 --> 52:43.544
- It put him there, didn't it?
- What?

52:44.069 --> 52:45.308
It knew we were gonna come this way

52:45.310 --> 52:46.909
and we were supposed to find him,
weren't we?

52:46.911 --> 52:48.671
Oh, for fuck's sakes.

52:48.793 --> 52:53.515
You don't fucking do this.
You keep your, your shit together.

52:53.517 --> 52:55.397
Shush. He's right.

52:55.399 --> 52:56.677
I'm not...

52:57.401 --> 52:58.799
I'm not leaving him like this.

53:26.751 --> 53:28.590
- We should say something.
- We need to go.

53:30.395 --> 53:31.753
It's gonna come back.

53:34.919 --> 53:36.277
Dom, come on.

53:37.442 --> 53:38.759
Come on.

53:49.614 --> 53:51.293
It was at that house.

53:53.739 --> 53:56.179
We had those nightmares
and it followed us, didn't it?

53:56.782 --> 53:58.020
Yeah.

53:59.222 --> 54:01.662
It followed us from that house
and it did that to Hutch.

54:03.429 --> 54:05.067
Did you actually see it yesterday?

54:05.671 --> 54:06.788
I don't know what I saw.

54:06.790 --> 54:09.311
Well... I did see it,

54:10.754 --> 54:13.076
while I was up on that ridge,
and the trees were the same as this.

54:13.078 --> 54:14.756
Oh, Jesus Christ.

54:15.082 --> 54:16.999
It was big, okay?

54:17.001 --> 54:19.082
It had to be to put that fucking elk
in the tree.

54:19.084 --> 54:21.966
It was hunters, pagan fucking
hill billies from those houses.

54:21.968 --> 54:23.928
No-one's lived in those houses
for years.

54:24.050 --> 54:26.449
- Fucking hell!
- Keep your voice down.

54:26.451 --> 54:28.130
- There are houses in this forest.
- Keep it down.

54:28.132 --> 54:30.733
There are people
and they killed our fucking friend!

54:30.735 --> 54:31.934
Shut the fuck up. Shut up!

54:33.337 --> 54:34.936
Keep your fucking voice down.

54:36.861 --> 54:39.860
There are three of us
and there is one of it.

54:40.745 --> 54:42.264
And I've got a fucking knife.

54:42.908 --> 54:45.789
So we are gonna keep walking
in the direction that Hutch said

54:45.791 --> 54:48.591
until we get out of this fucking
forest. Do you hear me?

55:47.293 --> 55:49.933
Oh, my God.

56:37.262 --> 56:40.742
You see? There's people.

56:42.629 --> 56:44.948
- Are we following these?
- Course not.

56:46.551 --> 56:47.909
We shouldn't go that way.

56:49.234 --> 56:51.473
Okay. Okay.

56:55.842 --> 56:57.199
South-west is up.

57:00.245 --> 57:01.443
I'm tired, man.

57:40.085 --> 57:41.564
Ah!

57:52.258 --> 57:53.536
It's okay.

57:58.465 --> 57:59.823
Come on, mate, get up.

58:01.346 --> 58:02.783
Got inside my head, man.

58:03.989 --> 58:06.148
Made me pray to that thing
in the house.

58:08.513 --> 58:10.232
I can't get it out of my fucking head.

58:12.278 --> 58:13.675
Come on, mate, get up.

58:14.560 --> 58:16.118
We're far away from that now.

58:17.682 --> 58:18.923
Come on, you can do it.

58:39.704 --> 58:41.383
Dom, look. Look.

58:43.630 --> 58:45.027
Phil.

58:53.920 --> 58:55.237
Where are you going?

59:12.259 --> 59:13.536
We're close.

59:15.461 --> 59:17.701
Guys! I can see the end!

59:19.305 --> 59:20.583
I can see the end.

59:26.393 --> 59:28.551
I shall... I shall try...

59:50.697 --> 59:52.014
Guys?

59:53.301 --> 59:54.579
Guys, you gotta see this.

59:55.421 --> 59:56.619
Dom?

59:58.386 --> 59:59.624
Phil.

01:00:00.468 --> 01:00:03.749
- What you doing?
- We heard something.

01:00:03.751 --> 01:00:05.029
Phil.

01:00:50.556 --> 01:00:52.274
You can't run.

01:01:29.675 --> 01:01:30.953
Dom...

01:01:32.278 --> 01:01:33.516
Dom!

01:01:34.921 --> 01:01:36.199
Phil?

01:02:03.549 --> 01:02:04.787
What the...

01:02:07.513 --> 01:02:10.433
You're alive, you're alive.
Where's Phil?

01:02:12.678 --> 01:02:16.318
I just heard something coming
and it, it just took him.

01:02:18.565 --> 01:02:20.525
What did you see?
What did it look like?

01:02:20.527 --> 01:02:23.127
I don't know. It's fast.

01:02:26.053 --> 01:02:27.493
It's fucking hunting us.

01:02:27.495 --> 01:02:30.095
Jesus Christ. I thought I'd die.

01:02:30.698 --> 01:02:33.459
I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna die alone.

01:02:33.461 --> 01:02:36.100
Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.

01:02:36.503 --> 01:02:40.186
I am not going to leave you. Okay?

01:02:40.188 --> 01:02:42.467
Okay?

01:02:48.995 --> 01:02:51.196
- Do you think it's gonna come back?
- Yes.

01:02:51.198 --> 01:02:52.516
Yeah.

01:02:53.241 --> 01:02:54.879
But I think I might
have found a way out.

01:03:00.367 --> 01:03:01.886
Do you think you can move your leg?

01:03:03.531 --> 01:03:05.290
Yeah, a little.

01:03:05.292 --> 01:03:07.732
Okay, okay.

01:03:10.578 --> 01:03:11.776
Piggy back?

01:03:15.302 --> 01:03:17.021
- I'm afraid we're gonna have to run.
- Yeah.

01:03:17.023 --> 01:03:19.021
- I know.
- Are you ready?

01:03:19.628 --> 01:03:21.867
In a minute. In a minute.

01:03:31.239 --> 01:03:32.516
Let's go on "three."

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:34.838
Okay?

01:03:36.443 --> 01:03:37.641
One...

01:03:40.809 --> 01:03:42.046
Two...

01:03:44.051 --> 01:03:45.328
Three.

01:03:47.654 --> 01:03:48.852
Come on.

01:04:23.929 --> 01:04:25.207
His eyes!

01:04:28.416 --> 01:04:29.694
Argh!

01:04:32.819 --> 01:04:34.018
There's a path.

01:04:37.986 --> 01:04:39.264
Oh, fuck.

01:04:39.827 --> 01:04:41.628
Oh, my God. No, no, no, no, no!

01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:43.028
- Phil!
- No, we gotta go!

01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:44.549
Phil!

01:04:55.283 --> 01:04:56.600
Hello?

01:04:58.487 --> 01:04:59.804
Please!

01:05:03.932 --> 01:05:06.811
Come on. Get up, get up, get up.

01:05:53.262 --> 01:05:54.821
- Luke.
- Mmm?

01:05:59.267 --> 01:06:00.584
Wake up.

01:06:02.511 --> 01:06:05.071
What the fuck?

01:06:13.642 --> 01:06:17.122
- What is that?
- I don't know. I don't fucking know.

01:06:31.459 --> 01:06:32.938
Okay, okay.

01:06:33.901 --> 01:06:35.138
What can you see?

01:06:35.944 --> 01:06:37.182
I see people.

01:06:39.027 --> 01:06:41.828
- Two, three... Four.
- What are they doing?

01:06:41.830 --> 01:06:44.828
It looks like they're building.

01:06:44.872 --> 01:06:46.712
Putting something together.
Building something.

01:06:46.916 --> 01:06:48.395
What the hell do they want?

01:06:51.039 --> 01:06:52.237
Those fuckers.

01:06:55.804 --> 01:06:57.122
I've gotta get out of here.

01:07:01.971 --> 01:07:03.329
Can you reach the table?

01:07:04.772 --> 01:07:06.252
- Why?
- Break the glass.

01:07:06.254 --> 01:07:07.572
Cut the ropes.

01:07:15.864 --> 01:07:17.623
Go on. Go on, Luke.

01:07:17.987 --> 01:07:19.185
Yes.

01:07:19.467 --> 01:07:20.705
Go on, Luke.

01:07:29.397 --> 01:07:30.635
Fuck.

01:08:03.511 --> 01:08:05.351
Is that water? Water?

01:08:25.814 --> 01:08:27.173
What are you doing?

01:08:39.828 --> 01:08:41.147
What?

01:08:54.122 --> 01:08:55.361
Come on.

01:08:55.765 --> 01:08:59.724
No, give him some. No, give him some.

01:09:04.895 --> 01:09:07.134
- No!
- What are you doing?

01:09:07.296 --> 01:09:10.255
Oh! Luke! Help!

01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:12.938
Dom!

01:09:20.028 --> 01:09:21.587
Dom!

01:09:25.234 --> 01:09:26.471
Dom!

01:09:29.236 --> 01:09:30.515
Dom!

01:09:37.765 --> 01:09:39.085
Argh!

01:09:39.568 --> 01:09:41.327
- Oh, please don't!
- Dom!

01:09:41.649 --> 01:09:44.529
Oh, God, no!

01:10:10.119 --> 01:10:16.280
They prepare for sacrifice. Over soon.

01:10:55.884 --> 01:10:57.203
You okay?

01:11:02.493 --> 01:11:03.770
Dom?

01:11:08.739 --> 01:11:09.976
Are you okay, mate?

01:11:13.903 --> 01:11:17.264
I never told you about my nightmare.

01:11:19.509 --> 01:11:23.990
I saw these people,
offering me to that thing.

01:11:25.675 --> 01:11:26.913
Dead hands.

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.357
Gripping me.

01:11:36.206 --> 01:11:39.047
And I saw... Gayle.

01:11:41.811 --> 01:11:43.089
I saw my wife.

01:11:48.659 --> 01:11:50.017
I'm gonna die here, Luke.

01:11:50.461 --> 01:11:54.942
No. No. No, you're not.
I couldn't lose all of you.

01:11:55.145 --> 01:11:57.025
They're gonna kill me.
Do you understand?

01:11:57.106 --> 01:11:58.266
They are not.

01:11:58.268 --> 01:12:00.906
They're not gonna kill you because
I'm not gonna let them kill you, okay?

01:12:01.349 --> 01:12:02.628
Listen to me.

01:12:03.834 --> 01:12:05.313
You're gonna get out of here

01:12:06.236 --> 01:12:12.118
and you're gonna burn this fucking
place to the ground behind you.

01:12:14.123 --> 01:12:15.401
Do you understand?

01:12:17.088 --> 01:12:20.046
You don't stop. You keep going.

01:12:21.129 --> 01:12:22.327
You live.

01:12:25.535 --> 01:12:27.175
And you tell my wife...

01:12:29.498 --> 01:12:31.217
I tried to get back to her.

01:12:31.421 --> 01:12:34.661
I'm not gonna do that,
cos I don't need to do that. Okay?

01:12:34.864 --> 01:12:36.102
Luke.

01:12:37.025 --> 01:12:39.664
I don't need to do that.
I don't need to do that.

01:12:42.072 --> 01:12:44.271
Okay? Okay?

01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:53.220
Come on. Come on.

01:14:02.672 --> 01:14:04.391
What the hell is this?

01:14:20.491 --> 01:14:24.812
You fucking stupid pricks.

01:14:27.937 --> 01:14:29.497
Why don't we do this, yeah?

01:14:30.502 --> 01:14:32.302
What are you waiting for?

01:14:42.391 --> 01:14:43.749
Come on.

01:14:46.796 --> 01:14:48.034
Come on.

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:51.000
What are you waiting for!

01:15:07.619 --> 01:15:08.816
Come on.

01:15:09.821 --> 01:15:11.100
Fucking come on.

01:15:55.426 --> 01:15:56.623
Gayle?

01:15:59.712 --> 01:16:00.948
Gayle!

01:16:01.952 --> 01:16:03.189
Dom?

01:16:07.397 --> 01:16:09.077
Gayle!

01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:11.599
Gayle?

01:16:23.093 --> 01:16:25.371
- Dom.
- Gayle?

01:17:52.143 --> 01:17:53.822
Did you take him down from the tree?

01:17:55.625 --> 01:17:57.064
We don't move the bodies.

01:17:58.148 --> 01:17:59.386
What is it?

01:18:00.151 --> 01:18:01.469
A god.

01:18:02.114 --> 01:18:03.432
Ancient.

01:18:04.196 --> 01:18:05.474
One of the Jotunn.

01:18:09.441 --> 01:18:11.680
A bastard offspring of Loki.

01:18:12.484 --> 01:18:13.842
We do not say its name.

01:18:14.285 --> 01:18:15.723
Because you're afraid of it?

01:18:17.047 --> 01:18:18.406
We worship it.

01:18:18.850 --> 01:18:20.128
It keeps us here.

01:18:21.252 --> 01:18:23.132
Let us live beyond natural life.

01:18:24.175 --> 01:18:27.455
No more pain. No more death.

01:18:30.903 --> 01:18:32.462
Your ritual begins tonight.

01:18:33.666 --> 01:18:35.465
It is a privilege to worship.

01:18:37.068 --> 01:18:38.828
You will kneel before the god.

01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:43.071
If not, it will hang you
from the trees.

01:18:47.357 --> 01:18:48.636
Why me?

01:18:51.522 --> 01:18:52.961
Your pain is great.

01:18:53.044 --> 01:18:56.645
Yeah, I'm not like you,
and I will not live like this.

01:18:58.851 --> 01:19:00.250
You will kneel before it,

01:19:00.252 --> 01:19:01.690
like the rest of us.

01:23:05.817 --> 01:23:07.015
Yes.

01:23:44.218 --> 01:23:45.497
Fuck off. Fuck off.

01:23:49.423 --> 01:23:51.501
Shit.

01:23:51.503 --> 01:23:53.622
Fuck.

01:24:16.609 --> 01:24:17.928
Drop the axe.

01:24:19.452 --> 01:24:20.690
Stay there.

01:24:21.214 --> 01:24:23.774
Stay there. Stay there. Stay there.

01:27:13.348 --> 01:27:14.666
No. No.
