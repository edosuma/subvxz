14:35.267 --> 14:37.767
We'll discuss this in the morning.

14:56.433 --> 14:58.433
[ Vehicle Passing ]

14:58.433 --> 15:00.267
[ Jed ]
Way to go, Amy.

15:00.267 --> 15:03.267
Oh, be quiet.
I never did anything.

15:03.267 --> 15:05.767
Jed, Sara, get ready for school.

15:06.267 --> 15:09.767
- I am ready.
- They want to talk to Amy alone.

15:14.467 --> 15:16.667
Amy, your mother and
I have talked about this,

15:16.667 --> 15:19.733
and we want you to tell us
what you think we should do.

15:19.733 --> 15:21.733
You mean like a punishment?

15:22.267 --> 15:24.700
I think we both know
that's not the answer.

15:24.700 --> 15:28.200
This is about a lot more than
wrecking your father's guitar.

15:28.200 --> 15:29.200
Amy, we want to help,

15:29.700 --> 15:32.567
but we can't begin to understand
what's happening here...

15:32.567 --> 15:35.567
if you keep blaming
Slappy for everything.

15:36.067 --> 15:37.600
I'm telling the truth.

15:39.600 --> 15:42.600
[ Sighs ]

15:42.600 --> 15:45.100
I'm late for an open house.

15:49.067 --> 15:50.500
When you're ready to tell us

15:50.500 --> 15:53.433
what's really bothering you,
then we'll talk.

15:53.433 --> 15:55.800
- Is that clear?
- [ Door Closes ]

15:56.733 --> 15:59.233
[ Engine Starts ]

16:06.767 --> 16:08.767
[ Margo ]
This is gonna be a really cool dance.

16:08.767 --> 16:09.767
[ Girl ]
Yeah.

16:10.267 --> 16:11.767
Let's put up a few more signs here,

16:11.767 --> 16:13.767
and then let's go down
to the next block.

16:15.267 --> 16:17.767
- It's gonna be the best dance--
- Hi, Margo.

16:23.767 --> 16:26.267
[ Sighs ]

16:31.767 --> 16:35.000
You're never gonna
hurt me again-- ever.

16:36.367 --> 16:38.867
Hey, kid, wait, wait--
Hey-- Hey, come on!

16:38.867 --> 16:40.900
[ Splashing ]

16:49.400 --> 16:52.867
So why'd you do it?
Really?

16:52.867 --> 16:54.867
- Do what?
- Wreck Dad's guitar.

16:54.867 --> 16:56.867
You knew you couldn't
get away with it.

16:57.367 --> 16:58.867
There's no point in me
telling you the truth,

16:58.867 --> 17:01.867
'cause you think I'm crazy anyways.

17:01.867 --> 17:04.867
Well, tell Jed
to wipe his stupid feet!

17:23.367 --> 17:24.700
[ Slappy ]
Hey, Amy?

17:24.700 --> 17:27.067
- Hmm? [ Gasps ]
- Guess who!

17:27.067 --> 17:30.467
- [ Laughs ]
- Keep away from me.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.733
But we're partners, Amy,
remember?

17:32.733 --> 17:36.333
Wasn't very nice of you to
dump me in the sewer like that.

17:36.333 --> 17:38.700
What do-- What do you want?

17:38.700 --> 17:40.700
Don't you get it yet?
You can't get rid of me.

17:40.700 --> 17:42.333
What are you talking about?

17:42.333 --> 17:44.033
Don't you remember, Amy?
You spoke the words.

17:44.033 --> 17:48.233
- "Karru marri odonna loma"--
- "...Molonu karrano"?

17:48.233 --> 17:51.067
You and I are one now.
Inseparable.

17:51.067 --> 17:52.567
You are my slave.

17:52.567 --> 17:55.333
No, I'm not gonna be your slave.
You can't make me!

17:55.333 --> 17:57.467
Ha! I can make you
do anything I want.

17:57.467 --> 18:00.233
You have no choice.
Your whole family thinks you're crazy.

18:00.233 --> 18:03.500
I've seen to that.
[ Laughs ]

18:03.500 --> 18:06.367
They'll lock you up. They can
only see you on visiting days.

18:06.367 --> 18:07.900
- No!
- [ Laughs ] Whoa!

18:07.900 --> 18:10.900
Amy, I can hurt you and your
family in a hundred ways.

18:11.400 --> 18:12.900
No! I won't let you!

18:13.333 --> 18:16.033
- Amy?
- Sara!

18:16.033 --> 18:18.967
- Amy, what is--
- Sara, he's-- He's-- He's--

18:18.967 --> 18:22.333
[ Laughing ]

18:22.333 --> 18:25.400
Hey, Sara, wanna play?

18:25.833 --> 18:28.900
[ Both Scream ]

18:29.767 --> 18:31.633
Hey, what's going on?

18:32.567 --> 18:35.833
You can run,
but you cannot hide!

18:36.333 --> 18:38.233
- [ Laughs ]
- [ Both Screaming ]

18:40.867 --> 18:43.533
- What are we gonna do?
- I can't believe it.

18:43.533 --> 18:46.600
- [ Slappy Laughing ]
- [ Both Scream ]

18:46.600 --> 18:49.267
Ready or not--
[ Laughs ]

18:49.267 --> 18:52.267
See? I told you.
No one would believe me.

18:52.267 --> 18:54.533
I know. I'm sorry.
I believe you now.

18:54.533 --> 18:57.633
- [ Slappy Laughs ]
- [ Footsteps Departing ]

18:58.633 --> 19:01.133
I think he's gone.

19:01.133 --> 19:03.133
[ Together ]
Jed!

19:11.733 --> 19:14.233
Jed?
Jed, are you okay?

19:38.133 --> 19:40.500
Jed?

19:41.433 --> 19:43.133
[ Lamp Shatters ]

19:43.133 --> 19:46.433
Yoo-hoo!
Lookin' for somebody?

19:48.333 --> 19:51.933
I've seen better swings
on playgrounds. [ Laughs ]

19:52.567 --> 19:56.433
- [ Footsteps ]
- Where is he? Where'd he go?

20:02.667 --> 20:04.733
- Gotcha!
- [ Gasps ]

20:04.733 --> 20:07.300
- Amy!
- [ Grunts ]

20:09.200 --> 20:11.367
Yee-haw!

20:12.767 --> 20:15.667
From now on,
this family belongs to me.

20:15.667 --> 20:19.067
You're mine, Amy.
You're mine.

20:19.067 --> 20:22.833
[ Laughing ]

20:22.833 --> 20:25.833
[ Screams ]

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
[ Breathing Heavily ]

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
- What was that?
- [ Dad ] What's going on here?

20:47.500 --> 20:49.000
Amy was telling the truth!

20:49.000 --> 20:51.500
Slappy was after us,
and then he turned out the lights!

20:51.500 --> 20:53.200
- But Jed saved us.
- What? Slow down.

20:53.633 --> 20:56.333
Yeah. What's going on?
What'd I do?

20:56.333 --> 21:00.767
If you didn't do it, then who--

21:05.667 --> 21:08.767
[ Laughs, Goofy Voice ]
It's good to be back in the family again.

21:08.767 --> 21:13.233
[ Laughing ]

21:13.233 --> 21:16.233
[ Laughing Continues, Echoes ]
