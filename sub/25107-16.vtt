<i>The courtroom</i>
<i>at Buster Bluth's murder trial...</i>

00:15.515 --> 00:18.226
<i>- Because that child is mine.</i>
<i>-  ...had been electrified</i>

00:18.518 --> 00:20.645
<i>after seeing a dramatic spin</i>

00:20.729 --> 00:23.732
<i>- off of the Bluths' family history.</i>
- Buster Bluth has killed before

00:23.815 --> 00:26.735
in the exact same manner
he killed Lucille Austero!

00:27.110 --> 00:28.820
Mistrial! Mistrial!

00:28.903 --> 00:31.406
Yes, yes, I missed your trial!

00:31.489 --> 00:33.074
<i>But while emotions were high...</i>

00:33.158 --> 00:37.245
- She can be your mother!
<i>- ...Michael noticed a subtle exchange.</i>

00:37.328 --> 00:41.207
- I need you to find some videotapes.
- They're back... ...in a box...

00:42.709 --> 00:44.419
You do that, and we'll see

00:44.502 --> 00:46.421
- about you calling me Mother.
- Right.

00:46.504 --> 00:49.591
<i>And so,</i>
<i>he decided to dig a little deeper.</i>

00:49.674 --> 00:50.842
<i>So, you thought</i>

00:50.925 --> 00:52.761
Mimi was talking about you.

00:52.844 --> 00:55.680
That... That you were her child,
and that she was gonna take you away.

00:55.764 --> 00:58.308
Well, had I known
that she was talking about Lindsay,

00:58.391 --> 01:00.393
I would have been, like,
"Goodbye, Felicia."

01:00.685 --> 01:04.480
I didn't even really get close to her
until we made soup that one time.

01:04.813 --> 01:07.233
Is it true?
Did you push Mimi down the stairs?

01:08.193 --> 01:11.404
I did, but nothing's gonna happen to me
'cause I'm just a boy.

01:13.573 --> 01:14.949
How come you never said anything?

01:15.033 --> 01:17.452
- How come Mom never told...
- You leave Mother out of this.

01:17.535 --> 01:19.454
- She knows nothing.
- Why are you protecting her?

01:19.537 --> 01:20.997
What are you not telling me?

01:21.331 --> 01:23.708
I did it,
but nothing's gonna happen to me

01:23.792 --> 01:25.543
because I'm just a boy.

01:26.336 --> 01:29.714
I heard that already, pal.
Do not protect Mother.

01:29.798 --> 01:33.176
This looks very, very bad.
You know, Lottie is gonna make it look

01:33.259 --> 01:36.012
like you're one of those guys
that pushes old ladies down stairs.

01:36.262 --> 01:39.599
Lottie. She's so mean.
I wish I could shove her down the st...

01:39.682 --> 01:41.643
Hey! Shh! No more talking
about shoving, pushing...

01:41.726 --> 01:43.353
- No touching!
- Or touching.

01:43.436 --> 01:46.648
- Yeah, feel it. It's a rental.
- Let's focus on your defense.

01:47.065 --> 01:48.775
Oh, I feel good about that.

01:49.651 --> 01:51.903
- You do?
- What I saw today in court...

01:51.986 --> 01:53.571
blew me away.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.615
What you saw in court today
is gonna <i>put </i> you away.

01:55.990 --> 01:58.034
Especially
after that body-dumping footage.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.744
I mean, what the hell was that?

01:59.828 --> 02:01.538
<i>Buster had been caught on tape,</i>

02:01.621 --> 02:07.168
<i>dumping a person-shaped thing into the sea
that only moments before he'd received...</i>

02:07.252 --> 02:08.752
I need your help with a, uh...

02:08.836 --> 02:10.922
- <i>...from Gob.</i>
- ...body-shaped thing.

02:11.005 --> 02:12.674
It's from a magician.

02:12.757 --> 02:14.926
Part
of his final farewell disappearing act.

02:15.009 --> 02:17.720
<i>Gob had last seen</i>
<i>his friend Tony Wonder</i>

02:17.804 --> 02:20.431
<i>during a sex-pref-swap illusion...</i>

02:20.515 --> 02:23.268
<i>...that he'd hoped would cement</i>
<i>their relationship.</i>

02:23.852 --> 02:27.188
<i>Which, in an unexpected way, it did...</i>

02:27.272 --> 02:30.817
<i>...leaving Gob with the necessity
of pretending he was a gay man.</i>

02:30.900 --> 02:33.903
- He's gonna have to stay gay.
<i>- Gob assumed he'd been ghosted.</i>

02:35.029 --> 02:36.865
<i>But after he was threatened by a group</i>

02:36.948 --> 02:40.326
<i>that somewhat tongue-in-cheek
called itself the Gay Mafia...</i>

02:40.410 --> 02:42.495
We know you're as straight
as an Oklahoma highway.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.873
<i>...his assumptions were cruelly confirmed.</i>

02:44.956 --> 02:46.749
And we're the ones doing the hurting.

02:46.833 --> 02:50.086
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>it was a brutal organization that was led</i>

02:50.170 --> 02:52.755
<i>by Lucille 2's brother, Argyle...</i>

02:52.839 --> 02:55.133
So... I have to stay gay?

02:55.216 --> 02:57.760
Just for seven years.
Then we'll let you age out.

02:58.261 --> 03:01.806
It's a lot more generous than what I did
to that last guy who faked being gay,

03:01.890 --> 03:03.808
- your pal Tony Wonder.
<i>-  ...who threatened</i>

03:03.892 --> 03:07.729
<i>that, since he's so good at magic,
maybe he should make something disappear.</i>

03:08.354 --> 03:10.106
Is that what I think it is?

03:10.190 --> 03:13.693
<i>Gob kept this part from Buster,</i>
<i>but told him it was a mannequin</i>

03:13.985 --> 03:16.571
<i>and swore him to secrecy nonetheless.</i>

03:16.946 --> 03:20.450
Um, it was given to me,
but I can't tell you by whom.

03:20.533 --> 03:22.994
But Dusty thinks we're
better off just ignoring it.

03:23.077 --> 03:26.873
Yeah, I think that's a bad idea.
And I'm a little concerned about Dusty.

03:26.956 --> 03:28.875
His inexperience could hurt you.
And, I'm sorry,

03:28.958 --> 03:31.669
I cannot let that happen. Not on my watch.

03:32.420 --> 03:35.298
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I saw <i>A Few Good Men, </i> too.

03:35.506 --> 03:40.678
But Dusty's the real deal.
Sorry, Michael. Game recognizes game.

03:40.970 --> 03:42.639
Mom is hiding something.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.683
She even asked Dusty
to find some secret videotapes.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.186
You wouldn't have any idea
where something like that would be,

03:48.269 --> 03:51.272
- would you?
- You don't have to save everyone, Michael.

03:51.356 --> 03:55.193
<i>Michael knew there was only one way</i>
<i>to get Buster to turn on his mother.</i>

03:55.276 --> 03:57.737
Okay. Don't tell me.
Dusty sure won't.

03:57.820 --> 04:00.156
Not after Mom told him
he could call her "Mother."

04:00.531 --> 04:03.284
Oh, they went to the cottage.
I'd check the cottage.

04:04.327 --> 04:06.204
<i>Now, the story of a wealthy family</i>

04:06.287 --> 04:09.290
<i>who lost everything,
and the one son who had no choice</i>

04:09.374 --> 04:11.042
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

04:16.880 --> 04:18.173
<i>It's </i> Arrested Development.

04:21.719 --> 04:24.347
<i>Michael arrived</i>
<i>at the family's beach cottage</i>

04:24.430 --> 04:27.558
<i>to discover
that his brother's hunch was correct.</i>

04:27.642 --> 04:29.644
What are you doing?
Research on the case?

04:29.727 --> 04:32.272
Hey, Mi... Michael. Maybe you can help me.
I, uh...

04:32.772 --> 04:34.315
I don't know what I'm lookin' for.

04:34.649 --> 04:38.194
Believe it or not,
I don't have that much trial experience.

04:38.486 --> 04:40.238
Yeah, sure. What are you trying to find?

04:40.321 --> 04:42.824
Your mom told me to get rid of a bunch
of these family tapes,

04:42.907 --> 04:45.952
but I can't imagine she'd want
to throw out all these memories.

04:46.536 --> 04:49.205
She asked you
to get rid of family memories?

04:49.289 --> 04:51.624
- Why? Is that weird?
- It's just that, typically,

04:51.708 --> 04:52.875
the drinking does that.

04:53.084 --> 04:56.004
Oh, that's good,
because she called it "evidence."

04:56.087 --> 05:00.300
But I don't think you're supposed to admit
to destroying evidence in court.

05:00.383 --> 05:01.509
- Sure.
- Again, I...

05:01.926 --> 05:04.595
don't have that much trial experience.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.931
- Yeah. Hey, why don't we see...
- Yeah.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.808
- ...what's in this box?
- Oh, well, my mom...

05:09.017 --> 05:12.437
your mom said that I'm supposed to be
the only one who looks in there,

05:12.520 --> 05:14.480
- but, um...
- I'm sure she wasn't talking about me.

05:14.564 --> 05:17.317
Uh, well, actually, she said <i>exactly </i> you.

05:17.567 --> 05:20.361
She even said the rules
were posted to be specific.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.739
I'm pretty sure that towel thing
is a shot at me, but...

05:22.822 --> 05:25.700
Well, we don't need to do everything
my mother asks us to do, right?

05:25.783 --> 05:28.786
Well, that's true. You're right.
Mother said don't open the box,

05:28.870 --> 05:31.080
but I don't see her around here anywhere.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.207
Mother, I'm going to open the box!

05:33.291 --> 05:35.084
Mom's not here, so it turns out

05:35.168 --> 05:38.588
she's not as all-powerful
as I think she is.

05:38.671 --> 05:42.216
<i>Getting to call Lucille "Mother"</i>
<i>had changed Dusty.</i>

05:42.675 --> 05:44.177
So, which ones do you wanna watch?

05:44.260 --> 05:46.387
"George Bluth, Affair: Caught in Act"

05:46.471 --> 05:50.224
or "George Bluth, Another Affair:
Caught in Act, Hi-Res"?

05:50.600 --> 05:53.269
I know which one I would watch
with a gun to my head.

05:55.730 --> 05:56.856
Not the hi-res.

05:56.939 --> 05:57.899
Oh.

05:58.775 --> 06:02.945
"Buster, Age Eight, Under Hypnosis: 1982."

06:03.029 --> 06:05.531
This... This is the year
that they tried to get him to wean.

06:05.782 --> 06:08.159
Hang on, that was... that was '83.

06:08.242 --> 06:10.661
Uh, 1982 was, uh...

06:11.537 --> 06:12.622
was...

06:17.710 --> 06:20.046
Awesome. '82 was awesome. Good year.

06:20.129 --> 06:24.050
- You haven't watched any of these?
- These are three-quarter-inch, Michael.

06:24.300 --> 06:26.469
This is not a TV station in the '70s.

06:27.178 --> 06:29.222
<i>But, fortunately,</i>
<i>Michael knew someone</i>

06:29.305 --> 06:30.681
<i>at a news station in his 70s.</i>

06:30.765 --> 06:34.310
Tell you what, uh,
let me take care of this, Dusty.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.187
Yeah,
I don't want to be too sentimental here,

06:36.270 --> 06:39.774
but these are my precious family evidence,

06:39.857 --> 06:42.235
so I should be the one
that gets to destroy them.

06:44.612 --> 06:48.074
<i>After talking to Michael,</i>
<i>Buster had grown even more nervous</i>

06:48.157 --> 06:50.118
<i>about keeping Gob's secret.</i>

06:50.201 --> 06:54.122
...the body you dumped
was Tony Wonder's magic dummy,

06:54.205 --> 06:56.499
because no one wants
to get put away for murder. I get it.

06:56.582 --> 06:58.376
It is their main evidence
against me,

06:58.459 --> 07:01.295
and it does look
like I'm disposing Lucille 2's body.

07:01.379 --> 07:03.297
Not, no...
Very different body types,

07:03.381 --> 07:05.216
I can assure you, just...
Even in the dark,

07:05.299 --> 07:07.802
you wouldn't make that, uh, mistake.

07:07.885 --> 07:11.973
Anyway, I'm concerned that, uh...
you, uh...

07:12.265 --> 07:16.519
Could you really enjoy your freedom,
knowing that you hurt my career?

07:16.602 --> 07:18.771
And don't forget, Buster,
when you were a boy,

07:18.855 --> 07:21.732
- magic saved your life.
- Uh...

07:21.816 --> 07:26.112
Uh, look, we don't have to say
that it was a Tony Wonder dummy.

07:26.654 --> 07:28.322
We could tell them
it's a random dummy.

07:28.406 --> 07:31.159
And violate magician-assistant privilege?
Not an option!

07:31.784 --> 07:33.828
If you help me with this illusion,

07:33.911 --> 07:37.290
then you can be my assistant
for the rest of my magic career.

07:37.623 --> 07:39.625
- Every show, every city...
- Oh.

07:39.709 --> 07:42.044
...pending availability
and parole conditions,

07:42.128 --> 07:43.004
- of course.
- Yeah.

07:43.087 --> 07:46.507
But what if I'm convicted, Gob?

07:48.342 --> 07:49.552
I don't know. I'll use Adhir.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.596
- Hmm.
- But if you <i>are </i> acquitted,

07:51.679 --> 07:55.224
we can start as soon as next week,
'cause I got a big illusion planned.

07:55.308 --> 07:58.561
- You know that wall we're building?
- No. I'm kind of out of the loop.

07:58.936 --> 08:00.438
- Who's Adhir?
- Doesn't matter.

08:00.521 --> 08:03.691
<i>But the Gay Mafia</i>
<i>wasn't out of the loop.</i>

08:03.774 --> 08:06.777
<i>Which is what had led
to two of Argyle's cronies</i>

08:06.861 --> 08:08.863
<i>recently showing up in Gob's office.</i>

08:08.946 --> 08:10.865
Argyle heard about the wall project.

08:10.948 --> 08:12.992
And he's a little insulted
you didn't ask him

08:13.075 --> 08:14.785
for a sit-down first.

08:14.869 --> 08:17.830
Because had you done the right thing
and talked to Argyle,

08:18.080 --> 08:20.666
you would have remembered
we're Newport Beach's

08:20.750 --> 08:22.627
premier cement provider.

08:23.044 --> 08:26.756
Something you already knew
from the trick you did at the parade.

08:26.839 --> 08:30.343
The one you did with your friend.
Tony Wonder. Well...

08:30.426 --> 08:33.010
...he certainly knows about it.

08:33.095 --> 08:37.058
It... It's just a prototype wall.
You know, I thought it was too small

08:37.140 --> 08:38.726
to bother Argyle with.

08:38.808 --> 08:42.270
Really? Even though you got
Congresswoman Sally Sitwell

08:42.355 --> 08:43.397
to call for it?

08:43.481 --> 08:45.775
Because, I tell you what,
you get a federal contract,

08:45.858 --> 08:47.193
that's a lot of cement.

08:47.276 --> 08:50.655
So why don't you let Argyle decide
whether or not he's bothered.

08:50.738 --> 08:54.742
Because if Argyle isn't happy,
the wall isn't gonna be the only thing

08:54.825 --> 08:56.160
covered in cement.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.496
<i>They were two tough guys</i>

08:58.579 --> 09:01.874
<i>right out of </i> Guys and Dolls,
<i>a play they were in the middle</i>

09:01.958 --> 09:06.128
<i>of a very successful four-week run of
at a local community theater.</i>

09:07.004 --> 09:09.423
<i>Reminds me of how Hanks walked around</i>

09:09.507 --> 09:13.261
<i>- like Jim Lovell for a year.</i>
- Argyle will be watching.

09:13.678 --> 09:17.348
And if he's happy, he just might be okay
with letting you go back

09:17.890 --> 09:19.433
to being straight.

09:20.101 --> 09:23.020
<i>And while their affect</i>
<i>may have been over the top,</i>

09:23.104 --> 09:25.356
<i>their threats were very real.</i>

09:26.148 --> 09:28.192
- Nice guys.
<i>- Of course, it would take Gob</i>

09:28.276 --> 09:30.027
<i>another hour to realize that.</i>

09:30.111 --> 09:32.363
So here's the illusion:
I'm gonna go into the wall

09:32.446 --> 09:33.990
- a gay man, which I am.
- Wow.

09:34.073 --> 09:36.117
If anyone from the Gay Mafia asks.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.536
And then, when I come out the other side,

09:38.619 --> 09:40.496
I will be magically straightened out.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.081
Well, cis male, high butch.

09:42.164 --> 09:46.168
<i>Gob had learned a lot</i>
<i>in the short time he'd been magically gay.</i>

09:46.377 --> 09:49.505
Buster, you do this for me...

09:50.381 --> 09:51.257
one day...

09:53.009 --> 09:54.927
I'll come to you for a favor.

10:02.226 --> 10:03.811
<i>And so, the next day,</i>

10:03.894 --> 10:07.064
<i>Michael sought out
a highly respected journalist...</i>

10:07.148 --> 10:09.984
Lean Cuisine? I think I got a Lean Pocket
around here somewhere.

10:10.067 --> 10:12.278
<i>...who was going</i>
<i>through a bitter divorce.</i>

10:12.361 --> 10:13.404
...nothing, thank you.

10:14.363 --> 10:18.034
You know, you look familiar to me.
Have... Have we met before?

10:18.117 --> 10:21.454
Well, John, you used our house
for <i>To Entrap a Local Predator.</i>

10:21.537 --> 10:22.622
- That's it.
- Yeah.

10:22.705 --> 10:25.166
- You were one of our super creeps.
- Yeah, yeah. Uh, no.

10:25.249 --> 10:28.711
- Oh, man, you were so out of it.
- Yeah.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.714
- I have it here.
<i>- And that's when Michael saw footage</i>

10:31.797 --> 10:32.715
<i>from a night</i>

10:32.798 --> 10:34.925
<i>- of which he had no recollection.</i>
- That's me!

10:35.009 --> 10:37.386
What am I doing in a Banana Stand shirt?

10:37.470 --> 10:38.763
Can you go back before all this?

10:38.846 --> 10:42.433
<i>A night in which Michael arrived</i>
<i>somewhat battered and bruised</i>

10:42.516 --> 10:44.518
<i>to the model home,
and ran into a brother...</i>

10:44.602 --> 10:46.395
I'm just not into Cuatro this year.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.731
<i>...with whom he shared</i>
<i>some very cryptic information.</i>

10:48.814 --> 10:51.275
I did something
that I wish I could forget.

10:51.359 --> 10:52.526
You've got no idea how I feel.

10:52.610 --> 10:54.945
<i>Before being surprised</i>
<i>by a guest of his brother's.</i>

10:55.446 --> 10:56.447
What is he doing there?

10:56.530 --> 10:58.282
<i>And Michael watched Gob give him</i>
<i>a pill</i>

10:58.366 --> 11:01.494
<i>that he used
to preserve the secret of the trick.</i>

11:01.911 --> 11:04.997
What... What was that?

11:05.081 --> 11:07.750
Whatever it was, it knocked you out

11:07.833 --> 11:10.252
- for two days.
<i>- ...forgetful...</i>

11:10.336 --> 11:12.672
<i>At that very moment,</i>
<i>the man who gave it to him</i>

11:12.755 --> 11:16.384
<i>- was being questioned by Dusty.</i>
- You and I are friends, don't you think?

11:16.467 --> 11:18.678
Objection. Is this going somewhere?

11:18.761 --> 11:21.263
Yeah, that's what I wanted to find out.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.768
So do you think we'll hang out together
after this?

11:26.686 --> 11:28.187
- I'll allow it.
- Ah...

11:28.270 --> 11:30.106
Hang out, like go to the beach
or something?

11:30.189 --> 11:31.607
How does that pertain?

11:33.192 --> 11:36.278
I just want to know
if he'll let me see his fort, because...

11:36.779 --> 11:38.280
- I'll allow it.
- Oh.

11:38.364 --> 11:42.284
- I won't allow that.
- That's... Sustained. That's...

11:42.368 --> 11:44.328
That's fine. That's fair. That's... Yeah.

11:44.412 --> 11:47.540
Mr. Bluth, you are a magician by trade.
Is that correct?

11:47.623 --> 11:48.582
- Illusionist.
- Oh.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.000
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, please.

11:50.084 --> 11:51.585
Sustained. I'll allow it.

11:52.002 --> 11:54.255
And you've worked
with the defendant before.

11:54.338 --> 11:56.757
This assistant...
This was your assistant, is that correct?

11:57.466 --> 12:00.386
Yes, he was my assistant.

12:00.511 --> 12:03.556
<i>Gob realized that Buster</i>
<i>had gotten him under oath,</i>

12:03.639 --> 12:05.141
<i>not just as a character witness...</i>

12:05.224 --> 12:08.185
Didn't you say he is the best assistant
you ever had?

12:08.561 --> 12:11.605
<i>...but to compel him</i>
<i>to take moral responsibility</i>

12:11.689 --> 12:13.607
<i>for the dumping of the body.</i>

12:13.691 --> 12:16.235
- Yes, I did.
- And what exactly

12:16.318 --> 12:18.654
was it that made him the best?

12:18.738 --> 12:21.073
<i>So Gob put</i>
<i>the moral responsibility...</i>

12:21.157 --> 12:22.742
He would never reveal a secret.

12:22.825 --> 12:24.160
<i>...back on Buster.</i>

12:25.035 --> 12:26.996
He would just act all dumb, like,

12:27.079 --> 12:29.081
- "I don't know what's happening, either."
- Mm.

12:29.290 --> 12:33.961
You know, he just... he was just so good
at acting like, "Where'd she go?

12:34.044 --> 12:36.380
What happened to her?
She just... She vanished."

12:37.673 --> 12:41.427
And he could take any object,
no matter its size, and make it disappear.

12:41.510 --> 12:44.096
Gone forever, like it never existed.

12:44.180 --> 12:47.850
- You'd never find a trace of it.
- Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

12:47.933 --> 12:50.728
And he had nerves of steel,
I tell you that much.

12:51.187 --> 12:56.275
Even if he was cutting a woman
in half... with that steel.

12:56.358 --> 12:59.653
And then he'd make the steel disappear
as well.

12:59.737 --> 13:02.072
- So cool.
- He was just a very...

13:03.699 --> 13:05.993
dumb-acting but...

13:07.578 --> 13:09.079
secretly sneaky guy.

13:09.872 --> 13:12.666
<i>And a rift had opened up</i>
<i>between the brothers.</i>

13:13.083 --> 13:16.629
<i>But Michael had discovered
that Gob was pretty sneaky himself.</i>

13:16.712 --> 13:20.966
So... Gob forget-me-nowed me
because of Tony.

13:21.592 --> 13:24.845
And that would be news on any other day,
but I've gotta save my brother.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.307
Can you play this tape for me?

13:28.390 --> 13:30.518
Yeah, sure.
Did anyone tell you about the...?

13:30.601 --> 13:32.895
Yes. Yep. Twenty-dollar tape deck rental.

13:33.729 --> 13:34.939
All right, let's plop her in

13:35.022 --> 13:37.274
- and see how she plays.
- Thank you.

13:38.567 --> 13:40.486
<i>Doctor-to-be, Tobias Fünke.</i>

13:40.569 --> 13:43.614
<i>Subject </i>, <i>who is now</i>
<i>in a deep hypnotic state,</i>

13:43.697 --> 13:47.117
<i>and this is my doctoral research material
on memory suppression.</i>

13:47.201 --> 13:48.994
<i>Memory suppression?</i>

13:49.078 --> 13:51.163
<i>No. Not that, no.</i>
<i>Give him some juice, please.</i>

13:51.247 --> 13:52.623
<i>Juice, please.</i>

13:52.706 --> 13:54.917
<i>...where we left off yesterday.</i>
<i>What happened to Mimi?</i>

13:55.000 --> 13:57.044
<i>I pushed her down the stairs.</i>

13:57.127 --> 13:59.547
<i>No. You didn't do anything.</i>
<i>You're a good boy.</i>

13:59.630 --> 14:03.384
<i>Juice, please! What really happened
is your mother pushed Mimi</i>

14:03.467 --> 14:06.095
<i>down the stairs.
But what do we tell the police?</i>

14:06.178 --> 14:08.055
<i>Mother pushed Mimi</i>
<i>down the stairs.</i>

14:08.138 --> 14:10.516
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>
<i>Please remove the juice, please!</i>

14:10.599 --> 14:13.310
<i>We tell the police</i>
<i>that </i> you <i>pushed Mimi down the stairs.</i>

14:13.394 --> 14:14.937
<i>I pushed Mimi</i>
<i>down the...</i>

14:15.020 --> 14:16.605
<i>No! No, your mother did!</i>

14:16.689 --> 14:18.649
<i>Watch me drink the juice, please.
Juice, please!</i>

14:18.732 --> 14:21.861
<i>You're confusing him.</i>
<i>Honey, even though we all know</i>

14:21.944 --> 14:25.281
<i>that I pushed Mimi down the stairs,
if you tell anyone that, I'll go to jail.</i>

14:25.364 --> 14:26.824
<i>I don't want you to.</i>

14:26.907 --> 14:28.450
- What a bitch.
<i>- That's right,</i>

14:28.534 --> 14:30.911
<i>so you have to save me
by saying you did it.</i>

14:30.995 --> 14:34.498
<i>But nothing is going to happen to you,
because you're just a boy.</i>

14:34.748 --> 14:37.126
<i>I did it,</i>
<i>but nothing's gonna happen to me</i>

14:37.209 --> 14:39.587
<i>- 'cause I'm just a boy.</i>
<i>- Can you say it again?</i>

14:39.670 --> 14:42.673
<i>...but nothing's</i>
<i>gonna happen to me 'cause I'm a boy.</i>

14:42.756 --> 14:44.341
<i>I wish I hadn't finished that juice.</i>

14:44.425 --> 14:46.844
- That's where it ends.
- Can you transfer that onto something

14:46.927 --> 14:48.554
less obsolete? I got to save my brother.

14:48.929 --> 14:52.182
I think it's time to find out
if Mother can handle the truth.

14:52.641 --> 14:54.268
<i>A Few Good Men. </i> Great movie.

14:54.977 --> 14:57.438
- But first, I got to wash the pile...
- Sure. Take your time.

14:57.521 --> 14:58.689
<i>Orange County Courthouse.</i>

14:59.023 --> 15:01.567
- Is the Bluth case still in session?
<i>- It was.</i>

15:01.650 --> 15:05.112
<i>As, after Gob had outsmarted
a dumb lawyer,</i>

15:05.195 --> 15:08.908
<i>the question was,
could he out-dumb a smart lawyer?</i>

15:08.991 --> 15:11.410
These objects that Buster could hide...

15:12.703 --> 15:14.455
were they as big as a human body?

15:14.663 --> 15:16.081
Oh, God, yeah, yeah.

15:16.290 --> 15:17.541
Just, I mean, the...

15:17.625 --> 15:20.419
often, the exact same dimension
of a human body,

15:20.586 --> 15:24.340
of an average human male or female body.

15:24.423 --> 15:25.466
Often a female body.

15:26.383 --> 15:28.552
- Any female body, really.
- This list

15:28.636 --> 15:33.724
of skills you mentioned, were they helpful
for, say, covering up a crime?

15:35.434 --> 15:38.729
I see what you're doing.

15:39.688 --> 15:40.731
Yes, it would.

15:42.316 --> 15:45.319
No more questions.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.905
Interesting, huh?
Hers were a lot easier than his.

15:50.157 --> 15:52.409
Permission to interrupt the case.

15:54.036 --> 15:55.996
- Could you identify yourself?
- You missed it.

15:56.413 --> 15:59.124
- I killed up there.
- I am Michael Bluth.

15:59.208 --> 16:03.671
I am the brother of the defendant
and... and cocounsel to Dusty.

16:03.754 --> 16:05.422
Permission to join the defense?

16:05.798 --> 16:07.299
Oh, that'll be great timing,

16:07.383 --> 16:09.009
because I've been drinking
this free court water.

16:09.426 --> 16:11.178
Does the prosecution have any objections?

16:11.261 --> 16:13.514
- I need a break.
- Oh, let him go.

16:13.597 --> 16:16.058
Oh, he worked through recess.

16:16.141 --> 16:18.686
All right.
Mr. Bluth, call your next witness.

16:18.769 --> 16:22.523
I would like to call Lucille Bluth,
the accused mother.

16:23.774 --> 16:26.986
I think you mean "the <i>accused's </i> mother."

16:28.112 --> 16:29.279
Oh, what did I say?

16:30.239 --> 16:33.993
Mrs. Bluth, would you please state
your relationship

16:34.284 --> 16:35.869
- to the defendant?
- Look at you,

16:35.953 --> 16:37.621
milking this for every moment.

16:37.705 --> 16:39.415
Isn't this classic Michael?

16:39.498 --> 16:43.293
We make fun of him all the time.
Right, Gob?

16:43.502 --> 16:46.046
<i>The rift</i>
<i>between the brothers had been repaired.</i>

16:46.130 --> 16:49.341
- Please just answer the question.
- I'm his mother.

16:49.800 --> 16:53.262
The district attorney has provided
some very provocative information

16:53.345 --> 16:55.055
about the defendant. She has claimed

16:55.139 --> 16:57.808
that he was responsible,
at a very young age,

16:57.891 --> 16:59.810
for pushing our grandmother, Mimi,

17:00.519 --> 17:03.605
down the stairs.
Thus, that he killed before.

17:04.064 --> 17:05.190
What are you doing, Michael?

17:05.272 --> 17:07.067
Trying to prove
the prosecution's theories?

17:07.151 --> 17:09.403
Stop showing off and get to the point.

17:09.486 --> 17:11.655
What if Buster did <i>not </i> push Mimi
down the stairs?

17:12.489 --> 17:14.700
- What are you talking about?
- The question is,

17:14.781 --> 17:18.996
do you recall the night
in 1982 when Mimi died?

17:19.079 --> 17:20.748
Where are you going with this, Michael?

17:20.829 --> 17:22.708
- I just want the truth.
- Oh, God,

17:22.790 --> 17:25.252
are you going for one
of your <i>Few Good Men </i> moments?

17:25.335 --> 17:26.920
You remember the night your mother died.

17:27.002 --> 17:31.216
- Of course I do. Terrible, what happened.
- Tell me, what did happen?

17:31.300 --> 17:33.677
Because the prosecution
would have us believe

17:34.053 --> 17:37.598
that Buster Bluth, your son,
my brother, was responsible

17:37.681 --> 17:39.767
- for that death.
- Well, he did confess to it.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.935
So it seems
that even Buster believes the story

17:42.019 --> 17:43.228
that happened in 1982.

17:43.312 --> 17:47.983
It was an accident. He was very young.
He didn't understand the consequences.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.277
So you are stating, as a fact,

17:50.360 --> 17:52.696
that Buster pushed your mother
down the stairs?

17:52.780 --> 17:54.865
<i>Buster </i> says Buster pushed my mother.

17:54.948 --> 17:56.825
And I think <i>you </i> pushed your mother.

17:57.284 --> 17:58.911
I think that Mimi might not have been

17:58.994 --> 18:00.704
the only person that took a fall
that night.

18:00.788 --> 18:03.373
I think you let Buster take a fall
for you.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.000
Oh, I see.

18:05.084 --> 18:08.003
So if I pushed my mother
down the stairs, maybe I did this, too?

18:08.087 --> 18:10.798
- Maybe you did.
- I... I thought this was about my mother.

18:10.881 --> 18:13.634
- It's about family, all of it.
- Stay on topic, Michael.

18:13.717 --> 18:15.052
Okay, let's do that.

18:15.135 --> 18:17.346
Where were you the night
that Lucille Austero disappeared?

18:17.429 --> 18:19.807
I don't know where I was.
I don't know who was where!

18:19.890 --> 18:21.517
Where were you?

18:24.645 --> 18:26.730
So it seems that I came home
from somewhere.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.899
The point is
that we're talking about you, not me.

18:28.982 --> 18:30.818
Well, maybe we should talk about you.

18:30.901 --> 18:32.694
You were there. You owed her money!

18:32.861 --> 18:34.696
- I need that money.
- Sure.

18:34.863 --> 18:36.949
You borrowed it,
didn't you, Michael?

18:37.699 --> 18:40.828
Yes, I did, because I care
about the family, which I thought...

18:40.911 --> 18:43.163
Oh, stay on topic.
You bounce like a beach ball.

18:43.247 --> 18:44.832
I'm answering the question.

18:44.915 --> 18:47.126
I'm saying, when you care
about a family or a business,

18:47.209 --> 18:48.877
you do things people might not understand.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.754
- Michael!
- ...what I might do.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.756
Are you threatening...

18:53.966 --> 18:57.553
And... sometimes you do bad things
that you don't remember...

18:57.636 --> 18:59.513
- or I don't want to remember.
- Objection.

18:59.596 --> 19:01.557
- Michael's out of control.
<i>- So maybe I was</i>

19:01.640 --> 19:03.058
out of control that night, but at least

19:03.142 --> 19:04.434
- I can admit it.
- Admit what?

19:04.518 --> 19:06.812
You're talking
like <i>you </i> killed Lucille Austero!

19:06.895 --> 19:10.983
You're goddamn right I did!

19:11.441 --> 19:15.320
<i>And that's how Michael</i>
A Few Good Men-ed <i>himself.</i>

19:15.404 --> 19:16.405
I think.

19:17.823 --> 19:18.782
I, uh...

19:19.366 --> 19:22.828
I... I, uh... I was there.
I was there, and, uh...

19:22.911 --> 19:24.580
Hey, Michael,
I need that money I lent you.

19:24.663 --> 19:27.082
I think that I went there
to see Lucille 2. I was mad at her.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.667
I... I had borrowed money...

19:28.750 --> 19:30.627
Does bad news count?

19:30.711 --> 19:32.379
- <i>I'm ashamed.</i>
- What are you doing?

19:32.462 --> 19:34.214
I offered to sleep with her

19:34.298 --> 19:37.259
so that she would forget
my $700,000 debt.

19:37.718 --> 19:39.052
Nice humblebrag.

19:39.136 --> 19:41.013
- Then we fought...
<i>- I cannot be held responsible...</i>

19:41.096 --> 19:42.931
...and I must have done something to her

19:43.015 --> 19:45.017
<i>and gotten my shirt bloody.</i>

19:45.100 --> 19:47.227
Why else would I change it
in the Banana Stand...

19:47.311 --> 19:48.812
Stop.
You don't know what you're talking about.

19:48.896 --> 19:52.691
But I definitely drove the stair car home,
and that's why it was next to the house.

19:52.774 --> 19:56.153
And, uh, the pill. Gob gave me that pill.

19:56.236 --> 19:58.822
That's what I saw
on that video at... at John Beard's,

19:58.906 --> 20:00.866
which is why I had forgotten
that I was at Cinco.

20:00.949 --> 20:02.242
Okay, Michael, that's enough.

20:02.326 --> 20:05.871
Even I was starting to believe
that Buster... but, uh...

20:06.997 --> 20:10.167
- I think that I'm the killer.
<i>- </i><i>And perhaps, it was at that moment</i>

20:10.250 --> 20:12.127
<i>- that Lottie realized...</i>
- I object.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.962
<i>...she had no chance of winning.</i>

20:14.046 --> 20:16.840
The opposing counsel... is confessing.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.887
No further confessions, Your Honor.

20:21.970 --> 20:24.514
<i>It was a stunningly dramatic twist,</i>

20:24.598 --> 20:27.601
<i>a real </i> Making of a Monster-<i>type moment.</i>

20:30.229 --> 20:31.980
- Michael, honest to God...
- Yeah?

20:32.064 --> 20:34.983
What the hell was that?
You had me on the stand.

20:35.067 --> 20:38.862
- You were making me look like a murderer!
- I'm sorry. I found the tapes

20:38.946 --> 20:41.406
where you were making Buster think
he pushed Mimi down the stairs.

20:41.490 --> 20:44.034
Exactly. Those are the tapes
I wanted you to find.

20:44.326 --> 20:46.662
I couldn't have laid it out
any more clearly for you.

20:47.412 --> 20:50.666
All you had to do was get me on the stand
and make me look like a liar.

20:50.749 --> 20:52.209
How do you screw that up?

20:52.501 --> 20:53.919
Screw that up?

20:54.670 --> 20:57.756
What, you wanted me to accuse you
of pushing Mimi down the stairs?

20:57.839 --> 20:59.800
We couldn't have the jury
thinking Buster did it,

20:59.883 --> 21:01.802
because they'd be totally convinced

21:01.885 --> 21:04.596
he did the same thing to Lucille 2,

21:04.680 --> 21:07.432
and I couldn't exactly accuse myself
of killing Mimi.

21:07.641 --> 21:11.186
I would just look like a loving mother
lying to protect her son.

21:11.770 --> 21:14.606
But I didn't push Mimi
down the stairs. Buster did.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.525
Mom, you're on tape
admitting that you did it

21:16.608 --> 21:19.403
and telling Buster to confess
to being a murderer.

21:19.861 --> 21:22.406
He thought he was saying that
to save his mother.

21:22.906 --> 21:25.158
We were implanting a memory.

21:25.242 --> 21:27.661
We didn't want him growing up
thinking he was a killer.

21:28.328 --> 21:29.538
Instead, he thinks he's a hero.

21:29.621 --> 21:32.165
Meanwhile, I grow up thinking I'm a hero,

21:32.249 --> 21:34.042
and I turn out to be a killer.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.752
- You didn't kill anyone.
- No, no.

21:35.836 --> 21:39.214
I think I did. They're probably
on their way to come lock me up right now.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.924
Lottie's not going to reopen the case.

21:41.008 --> 21:42.926
Mom, I just confessed in there.

21:43.010 --> 21:45.262
That you were drugged
and don't fully remember.

21:45.345 --> 21:46.596
Why did I change shirts?

21:46.680 --> 21:49.933
- Why did I say I lost control?
- Michael,

21:50.017 --> 21:53.186
they've got nothing.
No body. It's a mistrial.

21:54.187 --> 21:56.148
It's over. Dusty told me.

21:56.231 --> 21:59.026
Two brothers can't be charged
for the same crime.

21:59.192 --> 22:01.778
Well, I hate to say it,
but you may have been getting

22:01.862 --> 22:03.238
better advice from Barry.

22:03.322 --> 22:06.825
But I should talk. I mean, I thought...
I was better than this family,

22:06.908 --> 22:08.452
but I've made a mess of everything.

22:08.535 --> 22:10.203
I... I couldn't keep Lindsay around.

22:10.287 --> 22:13.498
My son will likely be ruined
at the wall unveiling

22:13.582 --> 22:17.586
for not having the software.
That's my fault.

22:17.669 --> 22:20.297
Turns out, I'm the worst.
I'm the worst Bluth.

22:20.380 --> 22:21.798
Never say that!

22:23.258 --> 22:24.926
Gob is the worst.

22:25.677 --> 22:29.181
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

22:35.062 --> 22:39.399
<i>On the day of both the wall</i>
<i>and the Fakeblock software unveiling,</i>

22:39.691 --> 22:41.943
<i>the Bluth family was growing anxious.</i>

22:43.862 --> 22:47.282
- You think Michael's gonna show?
- And miss a chance to save the day?

22:48.283 --> 22:49.993
We need this part to go well.

22:50.077 --> 22:52.829
Sally Sitwell can't shut this down
before the presentation.

22:52.913 --> 22:54.873
I'm actually more worried
about the Chinese.

22:54.956 --> 22:56.917
I don't think they're happy
with the protesters.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.544
If this doesn't work,
they'll never stop coming after us

22:59.628 --> 23:02.339
for the debt.
Oh, God, I just got an amiable nod.

23:02.422 --> 23:05.050
- Are you sure it was amiable?
- Yeah, it was pretty amiable.

23:05.675 --> 23:08.470
Okay, look away.
I wouldn't want our congresswoman

23:08.553 --> 23:10.722
- to think we're colluding.
- Hello, Lucille.

23:10.806 --> 23:13.141
- Oh, Sally.
- Colluding with who?

23:13.225 --> 23:14.643
Oh, the protesters.

23:14.726 --> 23:16.895
I don't know who let these libtards
in here.

23:16.978 --> 23:20.065
- I beg your pardon?
- People with liberal-tardation.

23:20.148 --> 23:22.901
Well, they're not making it easier for me
to sign off on this prototype.

23:22.984 --> 23:25.654
- I can't believe you'd let them in.
- We didn't let them in.

23:25.737 --> 23:28.031
I... I don't know how they got
past the guard gate.

23:28.115 --> 23:30.700
You know, maybe we should think
about hiring a guard.

23:30.784 --> 23:33.078
God, I see the problem.

23:33.453 --> 23:35.914
- Frosty the Snowflake over there.
- What do we want?

23:35.997 --> 23:37.999
- No wall!
- When do we want it?

23:38.083 --> 23:39.376
- We don't?
- That doesn't...

23:39.459 --> 23:41.586
- Tobias!
- Go limp! Go limp!

23:41.670 --> 23:43.422
Go... No, no, no, no. You...

23:43.505 --> 23:46.216
You look like you're
at a <i>Walking Dead </i> convention.

23:46.299 --> 23:48.844
- No, limp, like, uh, flaccid. Unerect.
- Um, George?

23:48.927 --> 23:49.886
Hmm?

23:49.970 --> 23:52.556
You should welcome
some of your friends over there.

23:52.639 --> 23:55.809
I can't believe my dry cleaners came.

23:55.892 --> 23:58.770
What are you doing?

23:58.854 --> 24:01.982
- Are you not a member of this family?
- Uh, he wants to be,

24:02.065 --> 24:04.401
but this is going to guarantee
it'll never happen.

24:04.484 --> 24:07.362
I'm sorry, but I'm doing this
for ethical reasons.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.281
- I need the money.
- Money?

24:09.948 --> 24:12.742
- These are paid protesters?
- Who's paying you?

24:12.826 --> 24:13.660
I am.

24:14.411 --> 24:18.039
And, Dad, I made you a chant follower,
not a chant leader.

24:18.123 --> 24:20.041
- Chant follower?
- I'm not paying you for that.

24:20.250 --> 24:22.210
Anyway, yes, we're protesting.

24:22.294 --> 24:25.338
This family can make George Michael
into a fully-blown Bluth,

24:25.422 --> 24:27.090
but they're not gonna do the same to me.

24:27.174 --> 24:29.092
No, it's turning you into your mother.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.720
Well, maybe this will bring her
back to this family.

24:31.803 --> 24:35.599
Lucille, I am sorry, I cannot authorize
this wall in front of these protesters,

24:35.682 --> 24:38.351
especially when it is your family
that's doing the protesting.

24:38.435 --> 24:41.938
I'll look ridiculous. I...
Channel 52 is here.

24:42.731 --> 24:45.066
- What is she paying you?
- Three dollars an hour

24:45.150 --> 24:47.736
and a copy of the news footage
for my reel.

24:47.819 --> 24:49.154
How'd you like to be a Bluth?

24:49.905 --> 24:52.365
- Fully-blown?
- No.

24:52.866 --> 24:55.994
And not your creepy girlfriend
or your imbecilic son.

24:56.077 --> 24:59.122
Funny story, that.

24:59.206 --> 25:00.707
They left me.

25:05.253 --> 25:06.963
Oh.

25:07.255 --> 25:10.967
I wear the horns of a cuckold.
That's why you don't put your girlfriend

25:11.051 --> 25:13.053
in the same sleeping bag with your son.

25:13.136 --> 25:16.848
But I'm not gonna let him share mine.
I like to spread my legs.

25:16.932 --> 25:19.476
- Apparently, so does DeBrie.
- Okay, don't worry about it.

25:19.559 --> 25:23.480
These people will follow me anywhere.
Hmm? Okay, folks, change of plans!

25:23.563 --> 25:27.275
Now, you guys got through, but let's keep
the rest of your family members away.

25:27.526 --> 25:31.696
I say we <i>do </i> put up the wall, huh?
Yes? What's happening?

25:32.197 --> 25:34.491
What? What? Oh, no! Go limp! Go limp!

25:34.574 --> 25:37.536
Okay. That might buy us time.

25:37.619 --> 25:40.330
<i>Which is what George</i>
<i>was doing with the Chinese investors.</i>

25:40.413 --> 25:42.165
Good. I think you're gonna be

25:42.249 --> 25:46.378
very, very impressed by the wall.
It's gonna, you know, keep everything out.

25:46.461 --> 25:48.004
We are much more concerned

25:48.088 --> 25:50.048
with the software portion
of the demonstration.

25:50.465 --> 25:53.927
We are very eager to see
how it interfere with the broadcast.

25:54.010 --> 25:55.762
We need something like this
in China.

25:55.845 --> 25:57.806
'Cause your game shows
are the worst.

25:58.181 --> 26:01.643
And, of course, this will be very helpful
in avoiding the spread of democracy.

26:02.352 --> 26:05.188
<i>And soon,</i>
<i>Buster caught up with his mother.</i>

26:05.480 --> 26:06.439
Hello, Mother.

26:07.899 --> 26:11.570
- Didn't expect to see you here.
<i>- </i> Why the hell wouldn't I be here?

26:12.070 --> 26:14.030
No, you would be. I wouldn't.
You didn't invite me.

26:14.948 --> 26:16.950
But, fortunately, Gob invited me.

26:18.076 --> 26:20.245
Hey, Gob.
I bet you think you're seeing me here.

26:20.328 --> 26:22.497
- Yeah, you're part of the illusion.
- Okay, I'll meet you backstage.

26:22.581 --> 26:23.873
Yeah, I expect to see you there.

26:23.957 --> 26:25.292
Why are you...?

26:25.375 --> 26:27.794
I bet you didn't expect him
to expect to see me back there.

26:28.712 --> 26:32.048
Wh... What did he mean?
He's not using you in his show, is he?

26:32.465 --> 26:34.718
Yes, because I'm a good assistant,

26:34.801 --> 26:37.220
and unlike you,
I know how to keep a secret.

26:37.679 --> 26:41.141
I can't believe you told Warden Gentles
about our family secrets.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.101
Look,

26:43.184 --> 26:45.061
you wanted to get out for the parade,

26:45.145 --> 26:47.606
but I drank too much, okay?

26:47.939 --> 26:51.860
This is why you don't go to rehab.
I lost all my tolerance.

26:52.485 --> 26:53.862
But I tried to fix it.

26:53.945 --> 26:57.616
That's why I wanted Michael
to expose that I was to blame.

26:57.699 --> 27:00.619
How was I to know he'd point the finger
at himself?

27:01.036 --> 27:04.039
- But it worked.
- Mother, I know the truth now.

27:04.873 --> 27:07.000
I always thought <i>you </i> pushed
Mimi down the stairs,

27:07.083 --> 27:09.961
and you made <i>me </i> take the blame.
I got it backwards.

27:10.545 --> 27:12.631
<i>I </i> pushed Mimi down the stairs.

27:12.714 --> 27:14.341
And you made me take the blame.
That's the same.

27:14.424 --> 27:18.470
But I want to thank you for that.
You were just trying to protect me.

27:18.803 --> 27:20.764
Can you imagine how weird
I would have turned out

27:20.847 --> 27:22.932
if I thought I did it?

27:24.059 --> 27:25.310
I really can't.

27:25.935 --> 27:28.396
<i>And soon, it was time</i>
<i>for the presentation to begin.</i>

27:28.480 --> 27:30.565
<i>...the president of Fakeblock,</i>

27:30.649 --> 27:32.442
<i>Mr. Gob Bluth!</i>

27:32.567 --> 27:34.569
"Gob"? Who said Gob?

27:34.653 --> 27:37.822
Gob, Gob! Who did?

27:37.906 --> 27:40.700
Thank you. Oh, and my...

27:40.784 --> 27:43.161
As many of you know,
for thousands of years,

27:43.244 --> 27:46.539
the U.S.-Mexico border
has been woefully unfenced.

27:46.623 --> 27:49.292
But today, that changes.

27:49.751 --> 27:51.586
Not literally today.
Today, we're just here

27:51.670 --> 27:53.046
for approval on a small piece of...

27:53.129 --> 27:55.298
Why am I being so serious?
We're gonna be rich.

27:55.382 --> 27:57.008
With this wall...

27:58.802 --> 28:00.428
Buster, would you get out of the...

28:02.639 --> 28:05.141
Today, in these plywood forms,

28:05.225 --> 28:09.562
10,000 pounds of wet, gay,
QuickHard cement

28:09.646 --> 28:13.817
will be poured, because if we build it,
they won't come!

28:13.900 --> 28:16.403
Oh, that's clever. All right,
get ready to storm the wall.

28:17.904 --> 28:20.323
But before I demonstrate
to you the software that will...

28:21.741 --> 28:25.120
I don't know, I guess just stop tweeting
from shithole countries,

28:25.203 --> 28:27.997
I'd like to make a special demonstration
of my own. As many of you know,

28:28.081 --> 28:30.083
I performed a trick a couple months ago

28:30.166 --> 28:33.670
where I turned from straight,
uh-huh, to gay.

28:34.504 --> 28:35.380
Uh...

28:35.839 --> 28:36.798
Now?

28:37.132 --> 28:39.300
No,
let's see how this pans out first.

28:39.551 --> 28:43.888
While my friend Tony Wonder
was encased in cement

28:44.222 --> 28:45.473
and never heard from again...

28:59.154 --> 29:02.532
Well, now it's my turn to transform back,
which I will do by starting

29:02.615 --> 29:04.159
on the other side of the wall
a gay man

29:04.242 --> 29:06.536
and turning straight as I walk

29:06.619 --> 29:08.329
through it.

29:08.413 --> 29:11.040
Hey, no, no,
take five from the beating.

29:11.124 --> 29:12.876
You can get back to it.
I want to see this trick.

29:12.959 --> 29:14.669
And to help me do that,
my assistant,

29:14.753 --> 29:16.838
direct from his mistrial,

29:16.921 --> 29:19.716

29:28.808 --> 29:30.810
How does it feel
to be accused of murder?

29:30.894 --> 29:34.606
It was a lot of work,
but I didn't do it!

29:34.689 --> 29:36.274
They found me not guilty.

29:37.108 --> 29:40.653
Well, it was a mistrial,
so they found you <i>not </i> not guilty.

29:40.737 --> 29:43.156
There was no body.
They will never find the body.

29:43.490 --> 29:46.743
Maybe I shouldn't have smoked
during his pregnancy.

29:46.826 --> 29:50.538
Well, to be fair, you...
you hate to drink without a cigarette.

29:50.872 --> 29:53.291
Speaking of magic,
you ought to get on with yours.

- Not proven!

30:16.105 --> 30:17.857
Well, it is a bit of a flaw

30:17.941 --> 30:21.069
that anybody can get
over our wall by using a rope ladder.

30:21.152 --> 30:25.323
<i>And while Gob was </i> shredding
<i>what little dignity he had left,</i>

30:25.990 --> 30:30.119
<i>George Michael was showing respect
to the family's Chinese benefactors.</i>

30:30.203 --> 30:32.831
How long until the clown's done
with the clown show?

30:32.914 --> 30:35.375
Uh, well, he's... technically,
he's not a clown. He's, um...

30:39.629 --> 30:42.131
Five minutes. Maybe six, if he has
a hard time getting his shirt off,

30:42.215 --> 30:45.051
but, you know, I have to let him do this.
He's my uncle.

30:45.134 --> 30:46.803
We have a word for this in Chinese.

30:46.886 --> 30:50.473
It means a combination
of embarrassment and obligation.

30:51.391 --> 30:53.852
- We need a word like that.
<i>- And after descending</i>

30:53.935 --> 30:57.730

<i>Ooh, mommy!</i>

<i>Seal me in.</i>

I'm sorry, a commercial enterprise.

You're selling Fakeblock? To who?

32:21.064 --> 32:23.066
- No, Dad, it doesn't matter. Please...
- Hey.

32:23.399 --> 32:25.693
Hold on. Is it... Is it Rebel?

32:25.777 --> 32:27.528
Are you selling the software
to the Howards?

32:27.612 --> 32:30.281
- Do not get in the middle of this.
- You said you would not sell to her

32:30.365 --> 32:32.325

but it does work, doesn't it?

32:32.408 --> 32:34.494
You don't want me to know.
Is that why you're trying to sell it

32:34.577 --> 32:35.703
before the demonstration?

32:35.787 --> 32:37.622
- Uh, this is not the time.
- You cannot do this.

32:37.705 --> 32:39.332
You cannot do this
because you're not the president.

32:39.415 --> 32:40.792
You're just the founder.
Gob is the president.

32:40.875 --> 32:42.335
- Can't sign without his signature.
- No?

32:42.418 --> 32:43.378
- No.
- Read the contract.

32:43.461 --> 32:46.172
As long as the president is incapacitated,
it's mine to sell.

32:46.255 --> 32:47.966
Incapacitated? What are you talking about?
Where's Gob?

32:48.174 --> 32:50.176
Oh, well, let's just say he's,
uh, in between things

32:50.259 --> 32:53.096
at the moment, okay?
He's plastered, all right?

32:53.930 --> 32:56.265
He's doing that Tony Wonder trick
where they pour cement on him.

32:56.349 --> 32:58.059
Last I heard,
he didn't know how to do it.

32:58.142 --> 32:59.227
You might want to check on that.

32:59.310 --> 33:01.354
I don't get it.
I... I don't get why you would do this.

33:01.437 --> 33:02.647

33:11.030 --> 33:14.367
- Howard you like me now?
- Of course you're choosing them,

33:14.450 --> 33:16.911
because you never forgave me
for Rebel, did you?

33:17.120 --> 33:19.455
After everything that I've done
for you, you're still trying

33:19.539 --> 33:21.332
to teach me a lesson?
Well, I got news for you,

33:21.416 --> 33:25.294
you can't sell
because I am still part owner in stock,

33:25.378 --> 33:27.422
- and I'm not incapacitated.
- No, not yet.

33:27.505 --> 33:29.257
Know what you have
in common with my new dad?

33:29.340 --> 33:33.261
<i>And that's when, in my opinion,</i>
<i>George Michael went too far.</i>

33:33.344 --> 33:34.721
You could both use a hit.

33:36.639 --> 33:38.433
- I'm sorry.
<i>- As did Michael.</i>

33:40.309 --> 33:43.938
<i>And an animosity that had been building
was finally acted out.</i>

33:46.858 --> 33:52.030
<i>And while the father and son fought</i>
<i>next to the quickly hard-drying wall...</i>

33:52.113 --> 33:54.824
<i>Gob could be heard trying
to fight his way through it.</i>

33:54.907 --> 33:57.744
<i>...more cement than I anticipated.</i>

33:59.495 --> 34:02.999
He's supposed to say,
"Remove the plywood now."

34:03.082 --> 34:05.460
I don't know why he's not saying it. Gob?

34:05.793 --> 34:08.170
You want me to remove the plywood now?

34:09.047 --> 34:12.467
This is quick-drying cement,
so the sooner you can answer...

34:15.928 --> 34:18.347
Okay,
I'm so, so sorry about that.

34:18.431 --> 34:20.308
We really wanna be
in business with you guys.

34:20.391 --> 34:21.809
We don't act like this all the time.

34:21.893 --> 34:24.312
And I can assure you that I am
in complete authority of both

34:24.395 --> 34:27.899
the Bluth Company and Fakeblock,
and we'd love to do this deal with you.

34:28.107 --> 34:29.692
- They told me you were fired.
- No,

34:29.775 --> 34:32.862
I'm on the board. Third in succession
if the other two are incapacitated.

34:33.612 --> 34:36.407
<i>Only feet away,</i>
<i>one of those incapacitations</i>

34:36.491 --> 34:37.658
<i>was on display.</i>

34:37.742 --> 34:40.369
<i>As with no response from his brother...</i>

34:40.453 --> 34:42.163
But I would rather have
a brother who's alive

34:42.246 --> 34:45.333
and maybe bisexual
than dead and straight!

34:45.416 --> 34:50.713
- I declare a mistrick! Remove the forms!
<i>- ...Buster appeared to panic.</i>

34:51.922 --> 34:55.051
<i>That's how Gob, years before anyone else,</i>

34:55.802 --> 35:00.598
<i>ended up with an immovable position
supporting a wall.</i>

35:02.767 --> 35:05.728
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

35:07.647 --> 35:09.690
- He's mad.
<i>- As were the Chinese.</i>

35:09.774 --> 35:12.276
We can't be in business
with a family like this.

35:12.360 --> 35:15.154
We look forward to your
repayment of our generosity.

35:15.238 --> 35:17.031
I can't... I can't do that.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.033
We... We have nothing
that... that we can give you.

35:19.117 --> 35:21.327
We need to build the wall
so we can end our debt to you.

35:21.410 --> 35:25.748
Well, we might be happy
with just the software component.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.085
You want to...

35:31.254 --> 35:34.048
You want to buy Fakeblock?
Well, we should... let's...

35:34.132 --> 35:36.050
we should wait
until after the demonstration.

35:36.134 --> 35:38.386
I... I don't want you
to take on too much risk.

35:38.469 --> 35:40.304
And I wouldn't know
what to charge you, sir.

35:40.388 --> 35:43.599
You will just sign it over,
and your debt will be forgiven.

35:43.683 --> 35:46.811
But this has to happen quickly,
before the young clown comes to,

35:46.894 --> 35:49.355
or they pull the dead clown
out of the wall.

35:49.438 --> 35:52.191
- We will agree to take this risk.
- Go, go, go!

35:52.275 --> 35:53.901
And I guess we should do this quickly.

35:53.985 --> 35:56.779
<i>And while these</i>
<i>no longer amiable businessmen</i>

35:56.863 --> 35:59.740
<i>signed their okay to taking over a company</i>

35:59.824 --> 36:02.118
<i>from a family that had fallen apart,</i>

36:03.202 --> 36:06.372
<i>a father and son signed their okay...</i>

36:07.373 --> 36:08.875
<i>knowing they hadn't.</i>

36:10.209 --> 36:13.421
I hope this allows you
to save face for your family.

36:13.713 --> 36:16.799
- Well, thank you.
- Let's go. Well done.

36:20.970 --> 36:24.515
<i>But onstage, it was Gob's face</i>
<i>that was at risk.</i>

36:24.599 --> 36:26.225
- Don't use the sledgehammer.
- Get him out of there.

36:26.601 --> 36:29.812
Did somebody say... Wonder?

36:29.896 --> 36:32.940
I wonder if Gob is... still alive!

36:34.525 --> 36:37.945
<i>He was, and as straight</i>
<i>as he'd ever been.</i>

36:38.112 --> 36:41.741
And I missed my cue.
And I missed my cue.

36:41.824 --> 36:44.243
<i>And Gob and Tony</i>
<i>finally reconnected.</i>

36:44.327 --> 36:46.704
- Sorry about jumping my line.
- I don't think anyone noticed.

36:46.787 --> 36:49.248
They were probably
just so surprised to see me still alive.

36:49.332 --> 36:50.958
Like you were blown away
to see me alive?

36:51.042 --> 36:54.045
You disappeared during that closet bit.
I thought that you were ghosting me.

36:54.128 --> 36:56.047
- To make me feel like a fool.
- No, look.

36:56.130 --> 36:57.965
I had to switch out
with a mannequin in the closet

36:58.049 --> 36:59.717
and pretend I was in the cement.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.844
Oh, no. Yeah, no,
I figured that out to do the...

37:01.928 --> 37:04.222
But when the Gay Mafia
dumped that body on me,

37:04.305 --> 37:05.890
you know, I... I just, uh... I don't know,

37:05.973 --> 37:09.435
- I thought maybe it wasn't a trick.
- Oh, so they wanted to scare you.

37:09.518 --> 37:11.771
My God,
they're such a bunch of drama thugs.

37:12.563 --> 37:15.107
Well, I might not have been dead,
but my career was.

37:15.191 --> 37:17.068
I was doing three shows a day
in Branson in the, uh,

37:17.151 --> 37:19.737
- Yakov Smirnoff Theater.
- What's he like?

37:20.071 --> 37:21.906
Disappointing. Disa... Uh, disappointing.

37:22.448 --> 37:24.575
Yeah, he treats you
like an audience member.

37:24.867 --> 37:26.619
But you freed me from that.
I still don't know

37:26.702 --> 37:28.829
how you got those Mafia guys
to cancel my contract.

37:28.913 --> 37:30.414
Well, I offered them a better contract.

- What a relief, huh?
- Same. Big-time, same.

37:41.926 --> 37:43.636
I guess I can go back to Joni Beard now.

37:44.136 --> 37:45.888

- Tony!

37:48.057 --> 37:50.935
- Tony!
- Hey. Yes, I see you.

37:51.936 --> 37:56.065
Cool out. One second. She's, um...

37:56.899 --> 37:58.776
Since her dad went missing,
she needs somebody

37:58.859 --> 38:00.486
to run Sitwell Construction, so...

38:01.904 --> 38:04.615
I guess that would make us competitors.

I guess, uh,
friendship is out of the question, then.

38:11.580 --> 38:13.165
But, I mean, we could do other stuff.

38:13.416 --> 38:14.959
Yeah. Like with our hands.

38:15.376 --> 38:16.669
Just hands.

- Oh. Is it that obvious?
- Yeah.

39:42.755 --> 39:46.050
- Did you get that from my office?
- Yeah, I Ali-Baba-ed a hand,

39:46.133 --> 39:49.470
- but at least they sent me a lefty.
- Just talked to Sally.

39:49.553 --> 39:52.598
She's never going to approve the wall.
Called it a debacle.

39:52.848 --> 39:55.142
And the Chinese got stuck
with the software.

39:55.226 --> 39:57.311
- Yep.
- Wait. But isn't it really valuable?

39:57.395 --> 39:59.438
Uh, didn't Murphybrown fix it?

39:59.772 --> 40:02.108
- <i>Briefly.</i>
- You made Fakeblock.

40:02.191 --> 40:03.818
You wanna see Ben Affleck's peen?

40:03.901 --> 40:06.695
<i>Because after installing</i>
<i>his homemade software</i>

40:06.779 --> 40:08.406
<i>into George Michael's computer...</i>

40:08.489 --> 40:10.866
Yep. What? Where is it?
It's all scrambled now.

40:10.950 --> 40:13.619
- It's gone.
- Yep, and forever.

40:13.702 --> 40:16.831
I fixed it so there's no way
to actually see the movie now.

40:16.997 --> 40:18.416
- So, um, um...
- So, basically,

40:18.499 --> 40:20.084
you came up
with a way to destroy content?

40:20.626 --> 40:22.294
- Yep.
- Damn it.

40:22.920 --> 40:25.506
All right. Well, we're back to poor.

40:25.589 --> 40:28.300
Looks like you two will be sharing
a sleeping bag tonight.

40:28.384 --> 40:30.761
<i>It's just sad</i>
<i>because we also don't have the wall.</i>

40:30.845 --> 40:33.180
It would have been so nice to be
super rich again, you know?

40:33.264 --> 40:34.640
Oh, nobody's gonna build a wall.

40:34.723 --> 40:36.684
According
to the succeeding <i>New York Times,</i>

40:36.767 --> 40:39.687
Donald Trump doesn't even have
a... a chance of winning that election.

40:39.770 --> 40:42.523
Oh, I don't know,
don't count out his likability.

40:42.606 --> 40:45.568
Oh, I suppose someone should let
toe-quotes "Rebel" know

40:45.651 --> 40:48.779
- that the deal is off, right?
- Yeah... gotta... gotta say thanks to her.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.907
<i>But, of course,</i>
<i>Rebel wasn't in on the con.</i>

40:51.991 --> 40:53.242
<i>Maeby was.</i>

40:53.325 --> 40:55.327
- Hey, Michael.
- Uh, how about that?

40:55.786 --> 40:58.330
- I guess they really did save the day.
- Shh. They'll hear you.

40:58.664 --> 41:00.416
Then they'll want something
for being heroes.

41:00.499 --> 41:02.918
Well, too late. I already did hear you.

41:03.002 --> 41:04.587
They're here for their paychecks.

41:04.670 --> 41:06.672
But I'll settle for a bedroom
with half bath.

41:06.755 --> 41:09.758
Nice try, but it wasn't exactly
your idea to protest.

41:09.842 --> 41:10.885
It was your daughter's.

41:10.968 --> 41:12.636
Where is that rebel?

41:12.720 --> 41:14.180
<i>She was celebrating with her cousin.</i>

41:14.263 --> 41:17.224
Wow. Someone thinks his cousin
is his mom.

41:17.308 --> 41:21.395
Uh, ex... excuse me, it wasn't her idea
to have paid protesters.

41:21.479 --> 41:22.855
It was mine.

41:22.938 --> 41:25.149
I was hoping it would bring out
Lucille Austero.

41:25.232 --> 41:29.153
But the trial is done!
I mean, why do we care?

41:29.236 --> 41:31.238
You don't really think
I had anything to do

41:31.322 --> 41:33.073
with her missing, do you?

41:35.159 --> 41:36.035
Do you?

41:36.118 --> 41:37.912
- Oh, no, Buster!
- Personally, I have nothing...

41:37.995 --> 41:39.413
- No.
- Of course not.

41:39.497 --> 41:41.790
- Oh, honestly!
- Remember who's in your corner.

41:42.374 --> 41:45.211
- Why is everybody so scared?
- Oh, hi, Uncle Buster.

41:45.294 --> 41:49.048
We were just speculating
as to where Lucille 2 ended up.

41:49.131 --> 41:51.091
Uh, we assumed she'd be here to protest.

41:51.175 --> 41:54.470
Well, maybe there's a surprise
under one of these burqas.

41:54.845 --> 41:56.680
You have got to be kidding.

41:57.181 --> 41:59.975
Well,
it's about time you showed your face,

42:00.059 --> 42:02.603
after what you've done
to our family, you...

42:04.271 --> 42:05.272
Hi.

42:05.898 --> 42:08.275
Wait, so, at the... Protester...

42:08.359 --> 42:09.902
That <i>was </i> you kicking me...

42:09.985 --> 42:12.029
In the balls.

42:12.112 --> 42:13.989
Yeah, your mother was kicking me
in the balls.

42:14.073 --> 42:16.408
I thought you left
to find your real mother.

42:16.617 --> 42:19.912
She's dead.
Buster pushed her down some stairs.

42:20.162 --> 42:22.831
Oh, my God. Lucille 2 is your mother?

42:24.750 --> 42:26.627
Mimi. Not Lucille 2.

42:26.710 --> 42:28.671
Oh, right.
That is who I pushed down the stairs.

42:28.754 --> 42:32.341
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Well, I just... I just put my...

42:32.424 --> 42:34.218
How often do you get to do that
when you're holding one of these?

42:34.927 --> 42:37.429
I showed her the rest
of the Ron Howard series.

42:38.013 --> 42:39.974
I knew this day was too good to be true.

42:40.057 --> 42:42.851
Let me have it.
I'm a liar and a terrible mother

42:42.935 --> 42:44.353
- for keeping it from you.
- Yeah.

42:44.853 --> 42:46.355
That's kind of true.

42:46.939 --> 42:51.193
Your anger spread to me,
made me a horrible partner to Tobias.

42:51.986 --> 42:54.530
And I will say you weren't
the most loving mommy yourself.

42:55.990 --> 42:58.576
But to be fair,
you barely knew Murphybrown, so...

42:58.659 --> 42:59.952
Oh, what the?

43:00.244 --> 43:03.122
Oh, yes. And you were a horrible mother
to Maeby, too.

43:03.205 --> 43:05.374
Okay, but on the other hand,

43:05.457 --> 43:09.795
you hid this ugly secret from me
so I wouldn't know my mother deserted me.

43:10.170 --> 43:13.632
So, you were a critical, difficult mother,

43:13.716 --> 43:16.510
but I gotta be honest, Lucy,
you're an amazing sister!

43:16.927 --> 43:19.305
Half-sister.

43:20.014 --> 43:22.474
I'm wondering
if this means that you will, uh,

43:22.558 --> 43:25.561
perhaps be willing to... take me back.

43:26.186 --> 43:28.647
We're a family.

43:28.731 --> 43:31.025
<i>Maeby really wanted to roll her eyes,</i>

43:31.108 --> 43:33.444
<i>but not as much as she wanted the hug.</i>

43:33.527 --> 43:36.113
- Wow. Family of the year.
- The mother year!

43:36.196 --> 43:38.115
Huh? Nothing breaks us apart.

43:38.198 --> 43:39.783
What happened to Michael
and George Michael?

43:39.867 --> 43:40.826
It's like they never showed up.

43:40.909 --> 43:43.120
Where the hell are they going?

43:43.203 --> 43:45.247
Probably pulling the car around.

43:45.331 --> 43:47.583
Actually,
I think they might be ready to move on.

43:47.666 --> 43:49.668
Right.
Michael always comes back.

43:49.752 --> 43:52.087
Yeah.
He thinks he has to "bring us together."

43:52.171 --> 43:55.591
Oh, Michael is such a zero.

43:55.674 --> 43:59.303
- Oh, he'll be back.
- Michael always comes back.

43:59.386 --> 44:00.346
Oh, he'll be back.

44:00.429 --> 44:02.723
Especially
after something goes horribly wrong,

44:02.806 --> 44:05.059
based on something stupid we did.

44:05.142 --> 44:09.355
I mean, this...
He'll be... God, Michael.

44:09.438 --> 44:13.025
No, no. I don't think anything's
gonna go horribly wrong

44:13.108 --> 44:14.276
for a long, long ti...

44:14.360 --> 44:16.153
On the next <i>Arrested Development...</i>

44:16.236 --> 44:18.489
We're taking down the wall.
What do you want us to do about this part?

44:18.572 --> 44:22.034
<i>The family deals</i>
<i>with some fallout from the wall.</i>

44:22.117 --> 44:24.203
Oh, no, that's nothing. Just take it down.

44:24.286 --> 44:26.205
No, I don't think we should do that.
It'll give away the trick.

44:26.288 --> 44:28.082
- We don't wanna reveal the trick.
- What are you talking...

44:28.165 --> 44:29.625
It doesn't matter.
Everybody knows that's not me.

44:29.708 --> 44:31.752
You put in a mannequin. That's the trick.

44:31.835 --> 44:34.380
Yeah. It's creepy.
It looks like a person.

44:34.463 --> 44:37.257
- Get it out of here.
- Plus, I wanna get my mask back.

44:56.860 --> 44:59.822
Hey, gang,
does Buster's mannequin look like...

44:59.905 --> 45:01.240
Judy Garland.

45:01.323 --> 45:02.825
Is it Lucille 2?

45:02.908 --> 45:04.618
Why is she smiling?

45:06.745 --> 45:08.163
This isn't a mannequin.

45:10.916 --> 45:12.000
This is...

45:13.127 --> 45:14.920
the happiest corpse I've ever seen.

45:28.934 --> 45:31.895
Okay, I did it. So...

45:37.443 --> 45:39.737
But doesn't she remind you of Mom?

45:40.305 --> 45:46.175
