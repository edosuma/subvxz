<i>Makes me.</i>

03:08.063 --> 03:10.486
<i>Feel that way.</i>

03:10.649 --> 03:11.650
<i>Ain't nobody.</i>

03:11.817 --> 03:15.947
<i>Ain't nobody better than you.</i>

<i>Nobody's better than you</i>

04:10.292 --> 04:11.418
<i>Do your thing.</i>

04:12.043 --> 04:13.716
Come on, Erik, give it a shot.

04:13.879 --> 04:15.222
<i>Do your thing</i>

04:19.259 --> 04:20.305
Hey.

04:20.469 --> 04:22.016
Aw, my little munkin.

04:22.554 --> 04:23.646
I'll go talk to him.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.557
Oh, let me try.

04:28.310 --> 04:29.732
Hey, little guy.

04:30.187 --> 04:31.689
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hm.

04:31.855 --> 04:34.825
- You're not joining the party?
- Mm-mm.

04:34.983 --> 04:36.200
Can you say why?

04:36.359 --> 04:37.281
Why?

04:37.569 --> 04:39.287
No. What I mean is,
why are you...?

04:39.446 --> 04:41.039
Uncle Mumble.

04:41.198 --> 04:42.745
I think he's asking,
"Why dance?“."

04:42.908 --> 04:45.411
Like, he needs a solid reason.
Don't you, Erik?

04:45.577 --> 04:46.624
Yeah.

04:46.870 --> 04:48.292
Plenty of reasons to dance.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.124
What's mine, Pa?

04:52.834 --> 04:54.962
Well, the only way to
find out is to try it.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.129
Come on, son.

04:56.463 --> 04:59.342
It's just one big old
foot after the other.

05:00.926 --> 05:03.179
No one'll laugh at
you, I promise.

05:06.223 --> 05:08.225
Come on. On my feet.

05:18.068 --> 05:19.536
<i>I don't care what
the people say.</i>

05:20.111 --> 05:20.782
Yeah.

05:21.988 --> 05:24.832
You'll get the hang of it.
All you gotta do...

05:24.991 --> 05:25.913
is feel the beat.

05:26.076 --> 05:28.374
<i>I'm gonna let it all
out, do my thing.</i>

05:29.788 --> 05:31.461
<i>We are a part of
the rhythm nation.</i>

05:31.623 --> 05:34.376
Come on, son.
Let's shake this world!

05:34.543 --> 05:36.011
<i>Show me what you're
workin' with.</i>

05:36.169 --> 05:37.170
<i>Do your thing.</i>

05:37.337 --> 05:38.634
<i>Let's dance,
let's shout.</i>

05:38.797 --> 05:40.014
<i>We're
bringing ﬂuffy back.</i>

05:40.173 --> 05:41.595
<i>Do your thing.</i>

05:41.758 --> 05:42.884
<i>Make my body sing.</i>

05:43.051 --> 05:44.928
That's it. Get stupid.

05:47.305 --> 05:50.024
<i>We are a part
of the rhythm...</i>

06:02.487 --> 06:03.864
It's not funny!

06:04.030 --> 06:08.285
Can you whiz on cue and finish with a headstand?
I don't think so.

06:08.451 --> 06:09.703
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?

06:10.912 --> 06:13.540
Oh, gosh. That was... Wow.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.254
Oh. Uh...

06:18.545 --> 06:19.797
Erik. Erik.

06:22.132 --> 06:24.976
Erik, I'm really sorry.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.223
Come on, champ.
It wasn't that bad.

06:30.265 --> 06:31.482
When I was your age...

06:31.641 --> 06:34.144
I got laughed at a lot.
They thought I was weird too.

06:34.436 --> 06:35.608
Mumble!

06:35.812 --> 06:37.564
I mean, different,
in a cool way.

06:37.731 --> 06:38.903
Like, you're cool.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.358
I was uncool.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.243
- Easy, easy. Whoa.
- Really uncool.

06:42.444 --> 06:43.616
Okay. You know, Erik...

06:43.778 --> 06:45.701
when your daddy's
in a deep hole...

06:45.864 --> 06:47.707
he's gotta learn
to stop digging.

06:47.866 --> 06:48.537
Yeah.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.418
Mumble!
A little help here.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.045
We'd never
have an egg with you.

06:52.203 --> 06:53.204
- No way.
- No way.

06:53.371 --> 06:55.089
Give me one good reason.
- Too short.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.376
- And you're gross.
- Is that guy bothering you?

06:57.542 --> 06:58.839
No, he's nobody.

07:01.129 --> 07:03.678
<i>I wanna
know what love is.</i>

07:03.840 --> 07:06.013
- Hey, Mumble.
- Amigo.

07:06.176 --> 07:07.428
Hey. Hey!

07:07.594 --> 07:09.562
<i>I want you to show me</i>

07:10.847 --> 07:13.396
- Ramon, get out of there.
- That's Erik's hole.

07:13.558 --> 07:14.650
- Ramon!
- What?

07:14.851 --> 07:16.945
We're having a private
conversation with Erik.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.275
So you, too, are mocked
and misunderstood?

07:21.441 --> 07:22.693
Amigo, please.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.611
Don't worry, I can fix it.

07:24.778 --> 07:25.449
No, no, no.

07:25.612 --> 07:26.989
Let me tell something to you.

07:27.155 --> 07:30.705
What's a best friend for if he cannot
bring a daddy and his boy together?

07:31.993 --> 07:33.586
Hello? Where are you?

07:34.621 --> 07:36.464
Hello? Hello? Hello?

07:37.082 --> 07:38.129
There you are.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.461
You know, ﬂuffito,
the truth is...

07:40.627 --> 07:44.257
for wild maverick outcasts
like us who cannot be tamed...

07:45.799 --> 07:47.346
this place sucks!

07:47.509 --> 07:49.011
Ramon, you're being ridiculous.

07:49.177 --> 07:50.224
Not any more.

07:50.387 --> 07:52.890
I am going home to Adelie Land.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.145
<i>Adelie
Land, Adelie Land.</i>

07:55.308 --> 07:58.278
<i>Be who you want to be
A haven for heroes.</i>

07:58.436 --> 07:59.483
Erik?

07:59.646 --> 08:01.648
Knock knock? Hello?

08:01.815 --> 08:04.739
Honey, I think he needs
to be alone right now.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.744
We can't leave him by
himself in a hole.

08:06.903 --> 08:08.280
We've got his back, sir.

08:08.446 --> 08:09.948
Yeah. True that.

08:11.658 --> 08:12.659
There you go.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.874
- Let the hoppers work it out.
- Quite right.

08:15.036 --> 08:15.753
Okay, come on.

08:15.912 --> 08:16.879
All right. Step away.

08:17.038 --> 08:19.757
Nothing to see here.
Shufflely off-ely.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.510
So much for my daddy skills.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.342
Adiós, Emperor Land!

08:24.504 --> 08:28.805
This is one fabulous penguin
you will never laugh at again.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.264
Never!

08:59.581 --> 09:02.175
Hey, Atticus. Snack time.

09:03.418 --> 09:04.294
Erik?

09:04.461 --> 09:06.304
Shh.
I think they're snuggled up.

09:06.671 --> 09:08.469
All snoozy.

09:09.257 --> 09:10.725
They're not here.

09:11.176 --> 09:12.894
Bobo!

09:13.303 --> 09:15.806
Oh! Boadicea!

09:16.222 --> 09:18.645
Come on, Atticus.
Why you fooling around?

09:18.808 --> 09:19.900
Where are you?

09:20.060 --> 09:21.437
I know you hear me, Atticus.

09:21.728 --> 09:25.653
Gloria? Do you think they could
have, you know, run off?

09:25.815 --> 09:27.408
Outside? By themselves?

09:27.567 --> 09:28.819
Maybe they followed Ramon.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.157
- Baby...
- I know, I know.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.789
But I really ought to check it out.
I won't be long.

09:32.947 --> 09:34.870
Mumble, relax.

09:35.033 --> 09:38.913
We will find them and when we do,
you'll find a way to put things right.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.296
You're a good dad.

09:41.414 --> 09:42.711
Yeah.

09:43.208 --> 09:46.337
I'll be back as soon
as I can, okay?

10:08.441 --> 10:09.943
Whoa, that was a big one.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.453
I hate it when that happens.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.988
Hey, Will? Is that you?

10:13.154 --> 10:14.997
Of course it's me.
Can't you tell?

10:15.156 --> 10:16.658
No. Not if we all look the same.

10:16.825 --> 10:17.747
I don't.

10:17.909 --> 10:20.879
Will, we are krill.
We are meant to look the same.

10:21.037 --> 10:24.166
Not me, Bill. There's only
one of me in all the world.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.960
I am one in a krillion. Hm.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.300
- Where you going?
- I'm leaving.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.679
I wanna be free, Bill!

10:30.839 --> 10:34.309
There's no such thing as free, Will.
Come on, less thinking, more swarming.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.061
I'm sick of swarming.
We've been swarming all our lives.

10:37.220 --> 10:39.188
It's like you've got
a mind of your own.

10:39.347 --> 10:41.566
Tell me, Bill, what
lies beyond the swarm?

10:41.724 --> 10:42.771
- More swarm.
- And then?

10:42.934 --> 10:44.231
- Some more swarm.
- And then?

10:44.394 --> 10:47.238
Will, there's nothing but swarm.
We are a swarm without end.

10:47.397 --> 10:49.695
Everything's got an end.
See? I end here.

10:49.858 --> 10:51.201
That is not a happy ending.

10:51.359 --> 10:52.736
It stands to reason, Bill...

10:52.902 --> 10:57.658
if I swim against the swarm, I must
eventually reach the end of the world.

10:57.824 --> 10:58.825
Yeah.

11:01.911 --> 11:05.586
Okay.
On the count of three.

11:05.748 --> 11:08.422
One, two, three!

11:11.212 --> 11:12.429
No.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.098
I can do this. I can do this.

11:14.257 --> 11:15.258
No, you can't.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.268
Yes, I can do this.
No, you can't.

11:17.427 --> 11:18.644
Who's talking to me? You.

11:18.803 --> 11:20.430
Who are you? Me. Who said that?

11:28.188 --> 11:28.905
Now <i>walk it</i> out.

11:29.063 --> 11:30.406
<i>Now walk it out.</i>

11:30.565 --> 11:31.782
<i>West side, walk it out.</i>

11:31.941 --> 11:33.193
<i>South side, walk it out.</i>

11:33.359 --> 11:34.827
<i>East side, walk it out.</i>

11:34.986 --> 11:35.828
<i>Hey!</i>

11:35.987 --> 11:38.331
Hey! What's up?
What's this? What's up?

11:38.489 --> 11:39.911
We're coming to Adelie Land.

11:40.074 --> 11:42.953
You aren't. You are without your
parents, this is chicknapping.

11:43.119 --> 11:44.416
Now go. Shoo, shoo!

11:44.579 --> 11:46.752
- But we can't. We're fugitives.
- Huh?

11:46.915 --> 11:48.542
- Fugi wha..?
- Fugitives.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.585
- Fleeing Emperor Land.
- No.

11:50.752 --> 11:52.470
- No happy feets.
- What?

11:52.629 --> 11:54.347
No happy feets.

11:54.505 --> 11:57.133
We're rebels seeking
thrills and adventure.

11:57.300 --> 11:58.677
And tasty snacks.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.140
Oh, thank you.

12:00.303 --> 12:04.024
This guy. All right.
I want a big fish, three little ones...

12:04.182 --> 12:06.776
Oh, oh! Some of those tiny crustaceans.
The little ones that go:

12:06.935 --> 12:08.357
Oh, yeah!

12:12.065 --> 12:15.194
- Now go.
- But we can't swim. We're way too fluffy.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.237
- What?
- Fluffy don't float.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.656
But it's too high.
I'm a leap..ophobic.

12:19.822 --> 12:22.371
Oh, dude! The water's right there.
Like, right there.

12:22.533 --> 12:24.956
I don't care.
It's too cold for a hot blood like me.

12:25.119 --> 12:29.545
Atticus, stop!
He's chewing on his flipper!

12:29.707 --> 12:31.755
Okay, okay.
Here's what we are going to do.

12:31.918 --> 12:35.673
We count to three. Push me on two.
But you don't tell me, okay?

12:35.838 --> 12:37.636
One, two!

12:37.799 --> 12:38.891
Aah!

12:39.050 --> 12:40.427
What'd you do that for?

12:42.303 --> 12:45.648
Baby penguins.
Cute, but ruthless.

12:47.433 --> 12:51.108
Will! Will!
What are we even looking for?

12:51.271 --> 12:54.366
That's the beauty of it, my friend.
I don't know.

12:54.524 --> 12:57.448
Will, please, come back.
I fear the worst.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.078
I fear the worst too, Bill...

12:59.237 --> 13:02.707
because fearing the best is
a complete waste of time.

13:03.408 --> 13:05.410
Oh, yeah. There!

13:09.372 --> 13:10.544
Maybe it's a black hole.

13:10.707 --> 13:13.426
They're just myths.
Scary talk, to keep us in the swarm.

13:13.584 --> 13:16.554
Coming out of nowhere, swallowing
everything in its path!

13:16.713 --> 13:19.387
For something that doesn't
exist, it's very impressive.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.222
- Swim! Aah!
- Whoa!

13:43.197 --> 13:44.699
Oh, yes.

13:45.199 --> 13:47.293
It's beautiful.

14:05.219 --> 14:06.596
Uncle Ramon?

14:06.888 --> 14:10.233
No. No, no, no. Kids...

14:10.850 --> 14:12.227
take me home.

14:16.439 --> 14:17.281
So this...

14:17.440 --> 14:20.284
is all we are. Lunch.

14:20.443 --> 14:24.073
To think we spent our whole
lives not knowing the truth.

14:24.447 --> 14:26.950
Goodbye, Krill World.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.337
Erik.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.089
Bo.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.468
Atticus.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.353
Ramon. Hmm.

15:03.361 --> 15:04.487
Listen.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.782
Do you hear that?

15:06.989 --> 15:09.492
That's the mating call
of the Adelie female.

15:09.659 --> 15:13.584
I'm about to be thrown to the ground and
crushed by a thousand <i>chicas.</i>

15:14.497 --> 15:18.968
It's okay, ladies!
The love god, he's back!

15:21.003 --> 15:24.177
Whoa!
Ignored by thousands.

15:24.382 --> 15:27.010
I said, "The
love god is back!"

15:30.263 --> 15:34.313
Come on. I got so much love,
I'm going to explode!

15:34.475 --> 15:36.978
Ramon! Amigos!

15:37.145 --> 15:39.523
- I can't believe it!
- I'm back in the band. Yeah!

15:39.689 --> 15:41.487
It's like you never
left, but you did.

15:43.151 --> 15:45.028
Ramon, triplets?

15:45.319 --> 15:46.662
No, there's only three.

15:47.196 --> 15:48.789
<i>Kids, amigos. Amigos, kids.</i>

15:48.948 --> 15:49.949
Oh, look at how cute.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.369
Where are the chicas?
The Ramon-starved <i>chicas?</i>

15:52.535 --> 15:55.584
- You been away too long.
- There's a lot more competition now, bro.

15:55.746 --> 15:56.713
Mm-hm.

15:56.873 --> 15:57.999
Impossible.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.508
Lovelace.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.889
<i>Guru.</i>

16:05.173 --> 16:07.392
<i>We love you.</i>

16:07.717 --> 16:08.809
Wow.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.187
- Same old Lovelace.
- Only completely different.

16:11.345 --> 16:13.063
He looks like a rainbow.

16:13.222 --> 16:14.144
Like a rainbow...

16:14.307 --> 16:15.980
- with man-chichis.
- Ramon.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.644
All right!

16:19.687 --> 16:22.190
Brothers and sisters!

16:22.356 --> 16:24.074
Penguins all!

16:25.276 --> 16:27.745
No matter how big!

16:27.987 --> 16:30.615
No matter how small!

16:31.073 --> 16:33.747
We are here today...

16:34.076 --> 16:38.673
for one extraordinary penguin!

16:38.998 --> 16:40.591
Yes, indeed!

16:41.459 --> 16:44.508
It's Sven time!

16:44.670 --> 16:46.263
Sven! Sven!

16:46.422 --> 16:48.891
<i>Sven! Sven! Sven!</i>

16:52.512 --> 16:55.265
A penguin who's not afraid of heights.
So what?

17:10.780 --> 17:11.781
- Whoa!
- Golly gosh!

17:11.989 --> 17:14.833
A penguin who can fly.

17:15.617 --> 17:18.588
UP-uppity-up!

17:25.294 --> 17:29.299
Okay, this Mr. Up is going down.

17:30.466 --> 17:34.061
<i>Share the
mystery of your history.</i>

17:34.220 --> 17:35.972
Tell it, brother! Testify.

17:36.138 --> 17:36.980
Oh, but friends...

17:37.139 --> 17:39.107
it's such a long story.

17:39.267 --> 17:40.439
Then tell the short one!

17:40.601 --> 17:41.318
Ramon.

17:41.519 --> 17:43.647
It begins with the loss of...

17:43.813 --> 17:46.236
Hey, Goldilocks.
That beak looks way too big on you!

17:46.399 --> 17:48.117
- It begins...
- The end.

17:48.276 --> 17:49.903
- Security!
- I can't believe this.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.446
Get your filthy flippers off me!

17:51.612 --> 17:53.330
Let him go.
He's fragile right now.

17:53.489 --> 17:55.116
Yeah!
You tell them, amigos!

17:55.283 --> 17:56.830
And they're still talking.

17:57.034 --> 18:00.584
We're still here for you, brother.
Go ahead.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.498
Okey-dokey. Ahem.

18:03.124 --> 18:06.469
It begin with the loss of my...

18:06.627 --> 18:10.928
No. No, no, no. I'm sorry.
The moment is gone. I've lost my mojo.

18:11.090 --> 18:11.841
Maybe tomorrow.

18:13.009 --> 18:16.513
No, I'm sorry. I'm not feeling it.
Show's over.

18:16.679 --> 18:18.727
- Please, sir.
- What?

18:19.640 --> 18:23.144
Does your story
have flying in it?

18:23.311 --> 18:24.187
Avvw.

18:24.353 --> 18:25.946
And where are you
from, little squirt?

18:26.105 --> 18:27.527
We're from the Emperor-hood.

18:27.690 --> 18:29.283
And what your name is?

18:29.442 --> 18:30.318
Erik.

18:30.484 --> 18:31.326
Ear-rik.

18:31.485 --> 18:36.036
Hm. In Svenland, we have many
brave warriors called Ear-rik.

18:36.198 --> 18:37.199
You do?

18:37.366 --> 18:38.868
Oh, ja.

18:39.493 --> 18:40.540
<i>Ja.</i>

18:43.080 --> 18:43.956
Everybody!

18:44.332 --> 18:47.131
Everybody!
Your attention, please.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.887
I dedicate my much-applauded...

18:50.046 --> 18:51.389
heartswarming saga...

18:51.589 --> 18:54.684
to my brave friend Ear-rik.

18:54.842 --> 18:57.766
Ear-rik.

18:58.596 --> 19:00.098
<i>Ear-rik.</i>

19:01.098 --> 19:02.691
<i>Ear-rik.</i>

19:03.893 --> 19:05.395
<i>Ear-rik.</i>

19:06.687 --> 19:07.529
<i>Ear-rik</i>

19:07.688 --> 19:08.814
"Ear-rik"?

19:09.231 --> 19:10.574
<i>Ear-rik</i>

19:10.733 --> 19:12.076
Erik.

19:12.234 --> 19:13.326
So...

19:13.694 --> 19:18.951
it begin with the
loss of my home!

19:19.116 --> 19:22.086
<i>He was the last of a
noble penguin race.</i>

19:22.244 --> 19:24.588
<i>Whose world collapsed
at a rapid pace.</i>

19:24.747 --> 19:27.216
<i>The power to ﬂy
was my saving grace.</i>

19:27.375 --> 19:29.673
The mighty Sven

19:31.212 --> 19:32.555
<i>From his pretty lips.</i>

19:32.713 --> 19:35.341
<i>With his stylish swoops
And his triple ﬂips.</i>

19:35.508 --> 19:37.727
<i>I alone escaped the apocalypse.</i>

19:37.885 --> 19:40.855
The mighty Sven.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.391
<i>He journeyed
far without a rest.</i>

19:43.557 --> 19:45.104
Ooh. Hello there.

19:45.935 --> 19:48.438
<i>Those fightin' titans
Were a heck of a test.</i>

19:48.646 --> 19:50.944
<i>But even they couldn't
take him down</i>

19:51.107 --> 19:54.907
<i>'Cause none could match The
guts and grit of Sven.</i>

19:55.653 --> 19:56.654
<i>Sven.</i>

19:57.196 --> 19:58.743
<i>Guts and grit.</i>

19:59.532 --> 20:01.079
<i>Guts and grit.</i>

20:01.242 --> 20:04.121
<i>He met the aliens
who ruled the seas.</i>

20:04.286 --> 20:06.584
<i>They took one look at him
And fell to their knees.</i>

20:06.956 --> 20:08.924
<i>They restored him.</i>

20:09.583 --> 20:11.460
<i>They adorned him.</i>

20:11.961 --> 20:17.764
<i>And they adored him.</i>

20:17.967 --> 20:19.935
<i>Then destiny showed its...</i>

20:21.429 --> 20:23.147
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

20:23.305 --> 20:26.149
Oh, it's okey-dokey.
Don't keep it inside.

20:26.308 --> 20:28.652
Yeah, it's okey-dokey.

20:28.811 --> 20:30.779
<i>Sing it out.</i>

20:30.938 --> 20:35.694
<i>Then destiny showed
its kindest face.</i>

20:36.152 --> 20:41.249
<i>When I was lost in
the darkest place.</i>

20:41.490 --> 20:44.585
<i>Before I drew my final breath.</i>

20:45.995 --> 20:47.167
<i>He delivered me.</i>

20:47.329 --> 20:52.335
<i>From the thick black death.</i>

20:53.002 --> 20:55.346
<i>Bathed and fluffed All
pleasures bestowed.</i>

20:55.963 --> 20:57.806
<i>I didn't want to end it.</i>

20:57.965 --> 21:01.265
<i>They covered me in a
protective robe.</i>

21:01.844 --> 21:05.348
<i>There I stood before him.</i>

21:06.015 --> 21:08.939
<i>Resplendent.</i>

21:09.101 --> 21:12.196
<i>Sven!</i> Sven!
Sven!

21:16.609 --> 21:18.486
Erik!

21:31.040 --> 21:34.294
<i>As I was
learning the alien speak.</i>

21:34.794 --> 21:36.796
What smells so gosh darn good-y?

21:36.962 --> 21:39.806
<i>Sven had a higher truth to seek.</i>

21:42.051 --> 21:44.395
<i>Who knows what he saw.</i>

21:44.553 --> 21:48.057
<i>In that mystic light?</i>

22:02.780 --> 22:04.077
Svensei!

22:04.240 --> 22:05.913
- I've seen our future.
- What?

22:06.075 --> 22:08.043
- Ja, it's calling to me.
- Yeah?

22:08.202 --> 22:11.251
It says "Sven.
Sven, go that way! Quickly!"

22:11.413 --> 22:12.756
I'm with you!

22:12.915 --> 22:14.838
The mighty Sven.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.252
Oh, my sweet eyes.

22:16.418 --> 22:18.170
He ﬂies.

22:18.337 --> 22:22.092
The mighty Sven.

22:23.050 --> 22:26.850
<i>And so he came
to this far, far shore.</i>

22:27.179 --> 22:29.773
<i>To shine his gifts upon us all.</i>

22:30.933 --> 22:32.025
What...?

22:34.270 --> 22:36.113
- What is it?
- It's incredible.

22:36.272 --> 22:38.115
- Really? You've never seen this?
- No.

22:38.315 --> 22:40.409
Green.

22:40.568 --> 22:42.787
Brothers and sisters,
behold the power...

22:42.945 --> 22:43.787
of Sven.

22:43.946 --> 22:46.369
<i>Let it out, let it out.</i>

22:46.532 --> 22:48.955
<i>Let it out Let it out.</i>

22:49.118 --> 22:51.621
<i>On that day, I took</i> a <i>vow.</i>

22:51.787 --> 22:56.964
<i>I, Sven, promises to use my
powers Only for good-y.</i>

22:57.126 --> 22:58.594
<i>Good-y, good-y.</i>

22:58.752 --> 23:00.754
And I dedicate full-time...

23:00.921 --> 23:05.267
to the "createment"
of a new Adelie Land!

23:25.321 --> 23:29.667
ls there no end to
the power of Sven?

23:31.744 --> 23:32.996
Sven! Sven!

23:33.162 --> 23:35.164
Sven!
Marry me! Marry me!

23:35.372 --> 23:36.669
No, marry me!

23:37.041 --> 23:38.167
Marry me! Marry me!

23:38.500 --> 23:39.626
No, no, marry me!

23:39.793 --> 23:41.841
- No, marry me!
- Marry me!

23:42.421 --> 23:43.968
Ah, my beauties.

23:44.131 --> 23:48.602
But if I love the few,
who will love the many?

23:48.761 --> 23:51.139
But if they love
you, who will love Ramon?

23:51.347 --> 23:52.519
Ramon!

23:52.973 --> 23:54.975
Somebody? Anybody?

23:55.351 --> 23:56.694
Nobody?

23:57.102 --> 23:58.354
Body?

23:58.520 --> 24:00.818
Aw, bitter,
twisted, lonely guy.

24:00.981 --> 24:03.359
You must learn to
think like Sven.

24:03.525 --> 24:04.276
Why?

24:04.443 --> 24:05.319
If you want it...

24:05.486 --> 24:06.533

Mm-hm.

Okay.

25:25.399 --> 25:26.992
Mumble, Ear-rik is your boy?

25:27.276 --> 25:28.698
Yes, he is. Kids...

25:28.861 --> 25:31.580
- ...we're leaving.
- Uncle Mumble, no fair!

25:31.739 --> 25:35.960
- Come on, all of you.
- Oh, no. But this place is so much fun.

25:36.118 --> 25:37.665
Erik. Let's go.

25:37.828 --> 25:40.297
- I'm not going back to Emperor Land.
- Don't be silly.

25:40.456 --> 25:41.457
I'm staying here.

25:41.623 --> 25:44.968
What about the folks back home and
how worried your mother must be?

25:45.127 --> 25:48.597
Ear-rik, it's best to do
what your father's saying.

25:48.756 --> 25:50.474
But I don't belong there.

25:50.632 --> 25:55.308
Oh, ﬂuffy one, I want to
tell to you a secret. Okay?

25:55.512 --> 25:59.016
Sometimes, when you are
a little different...

25:59.183 --> 26:00.810
the world laugh at you, ja?

26:01.018 --> 26:01.644
Yeah.

26:01.810 --> 26:02.982
Think you're funny.

26:03.145 --> 26:04.647
- Pointing flippers.
- Mm-hm.

26:04.813 --> 26:07.817
Ja, well, we have a
saying back in Svenland.

26:12.237 --> 26:14.285
Believe in yourself, Ear-rik...

26:14.448 --> 26:16.701
because Sven believe in you.

26:18.285 --> 26:19.912
- Mighty Sven?
<i>- Ja?</i>

26:20.079 --> 26:22.298
Will I ever fly?

26:22.456 --> 26:26.086
- Erik, please.
- Mumble, the boy seeks a higher truth.

26:26.502 --> 26:28.675
If you want it,
you must will it.

26:28.837 --> 26:29.963
If you will it...

26:30.130 --> 26:32.178
it will be yours.

26:32.758 --> 26:35.637
Now, go.

26:39.431 --> 26:40.523
Avvw.

26:49.525 --> 26:50.526
Ciao.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.159
Ciao.

27:02.371 --> 27:04.419
Uh, son?

27:04.581 --> 27:05.924
Erik...

27:06.083 --> 27:08.552
you know, when
things go wrong...

27:08.710 --> 27:11.884
running away is not the answer.
Okay?

27:12.047 --> 27:15.893
You have to find within yourself
a way to handle it. Okay?

27:16.051 --> 27:16.722
Yeah.

27:16.885 --> 27:18.887
Yeah. And we're all different.

27:19.054 --> 27:21.807
It's part of the job of life
to find out who you are...

27:21.974 --> 27:23.191
and what you got.

27:23.350 --> 27:25.227
It may not be dancing
or flying...

27:25.394 --> 27:26.862
but when you find it...

27:27.396 --> 27:29.148
it'll be all yours.

27:29.314 --> 27:31.157
You know what I'm saying?

27:31.483 --> 27:32.029
Yeah.

27:32.192 --> 27:33.660
Okey-dokey.

27:35.237 --> 27:36.830
Right.

27:37.197 --> 27:38.369
<i>Sven</i>

27:48.208 --> 27:50.427
Will! Will! Will!
What is this?!

27:50.627 --> 27:52.254
It's the wave of change!

27:52.421 --> 27:56.016
The world is changing, Bill.
We've got to get on the ride!

28:08.604 --> 28:11.448
By the mother of Guin.
This cannot be.

28:40.010 --> 28:42.809
Whoa. Something somewhere
just took a big bump.

28:42.971 --> 28:43.938
Yeah.

28:44.473 --> 28:47.147
Sounded awfully close
to Emperor Land.

28:47.309 --> 28:50.153
Come on, guys.
Let's pick up the pace.

28:52.147 --> 28:54.070
- This is our moment, Bill.
- Okay.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.156
Adapt or die, my friend.

28:56.318 --> 28:59.162
Adapt? There's no telling
what we might become.

28:59.321 --> 29:01.289
Fine. Be a plankton
muncher all your life.

29:01.448 --> 29:04.327
But that's what we are.
We're herbivores. We eat veggies.

29:04.493 --> 29:06.837
Right.
So everyone else can eat us.

29:07.246 --> 29:09.669
Well, I am not prepared to
be on the menu any longer.

29:09.831 --> 29:12.084
- Where you going?
- I'm moving up the food chain.

29:12.251 --> 29:13.218
The food chain?

29:13.377 --> 29:15.471
I'm gonna go chew on
something that has a face!

29:22.177 --> 29:24.179
- I don't remember this.
- Yeah.

29:24.346 --> 29:26.940
Well, things always
look different on the way back.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.067
Guess we'll have to go
all the way around.

29:29.226 --> 29:31.194
- But Emperor Land is straight ahead.
- Yeah.

29:31.353 --> 29:32.775
So why not go over that?

29:32.938 --> 29:34.281
No, no.
This way is better.

29:34.439 --> 29:35.941
But shortcuts are shorter.

29:36.108 --> 29:38.611
Not always. Now, come on.
It's not that far.

29:40.112 --> 29:41.830
Guys, stop!

29:43.365 --> 29:45.959
Erik. I said stop!

29:49.454 --> 29:50.626
All right.

29:51.039 --> 29:52.131
All right.

29:52.291 --> 29:56.387
We'll keep going, but
take it nice and slow.

30:01.383 --> 30:04.728
And what's say we don't
look down, okay?

30:05.804 --> 30:07.556
Atticus, what did I just say?

30:08.056 --> 30:09.558
- Whoa!
- Wow.

30:09.725 --> 30:10.692
G'day, sport.

30:10.851 --> 30:11.693
Hi.

30:11.852 --> 30:13.399
- Where you heading?
- Home.

30:13.562 --> 30:16.111
Oh, yeah? So am I.

30:17.482 --> 30:20.201
If you don't mind backing
up a little bit...

30:20.360 --> 30:21.612
we'll just squeeze past.

30:21.778 --> 30:25.032
That's the one thing I
Back up.

30:25.198 --> 30:27.041
The Beachmaster backs
up for nobody.

30:27.200 --> 30:27.826
Then maybe...

30:27.993 --> 30:29.165
you can move sideways.

30:29.328 --> 30:30.375
Don't do sideways.

30:30.537 --> 30:32.005
We've come all the way across.

30:32.164 --> 30:33.791
You'll have to go
all the way back.

30:33.957 --> 30:35.925
I've got the kids.
It's kind of dangerous.

30:36.084 --> 30:36.926
Of course.

30:37.085 --> 30:39.508
- And we're anxious to get home.
- I see. Fair enough.

30:39.921 --> 30:41.764
But see it my way, sport.

30:41.923 --> 30:44.051
One day, I'll be
protecting my beach...

30:44.217 --> 30:46.766
and some pumped-up mongrel
wants to take it from me.

30:47.220 --> 30:49.939
We're nose-to-nose.
The whole world's watching.

30:50.098 --> 30:52.772
And in the back of me mind,
there's this niggling doubt:

30:52.934 --> 30:54.436
I once backed up for a penguin.

30:54.936 --> 30:56.188
He'll see it in me eyes...

30:56.355 --> 30:58.574
and I'm gone. Goodbye, ladies.

30:58.732 --> 31:00.700
Hello, lonely beach.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.031
- You with me?
- Yeah, but...

31:02.194 --> 31:03.912
Then get out of my way.

31:04.071 --> 31:08.451
"My mother says, “Every
obstacle is an opportunity."

31:08.617 --> 31:10.460
What? Bo. Bo!

31:10.952 --> 31:12.579
Whoa! Unh!

31:12.746 --> 31:14.874
Hey! Yo, dog!
You be apologizing...

31:15.374 --> 31:18.093
or I'm gonna tear
you a new nostril.

31:20.462 --> 31:21.554
He didn't mean that.

31:21.713 --> 31:23.090
That's okay.

31:23.632 --> 31:25.054
I didn't mean that.

31:25.425 --> 31:27.974
SvenTHINK, SvenTHINK.
- Erik, no!

31:28.720 --> 31:29.721
Golly gosh!

31:29.888 --> 31:30.639
You fat...

31:30.806 --> 31:31.978
mother of all bullies!

31:32.140 --> 31:33.392
Get out of my way!

31:34.643 --> 31:36.987
Oh, no.

31:37.938 --> 31:38.655
Erik.

31:38.939 --> 31:39.861
Daddy. Daddy.

31:40.315 --> 31:43.114
- Where are you, Daddy?
- Where's he gone?

31:44.528 --> 31:45.324
Uh-oh.

31:45.487 --> 31:46.784
That's not healthy.

31:46.947 --> 31:48.290
Are you okay?

31:48.448 --> 31:49.995
Not exactly.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.495
Daddy, what
are you doing...

31:53.662 --> 31:55.335
- ...down there?
- Get back up here.

31:55.497 --> 31:57.124
Not sure I can.

31:57.290 --> 31:58.416
There is a way...

31:58.583 --> 31:59.926
but you won't like it.

32:01.378 --> 32:03.176
You want me to back
up, don't you?

32:03.380 --> 32:04.176
Come on, Dad.

32:04.339 --> 32:05.306
You can do it.

32:05.465 --> 32:07.968
We won't think less
of you, Daddy.

32:08.135 --> 32:13.107
Well, I suppose technically
it's just reversing.

32:13.265 --> 32:16.189
I guess I could, you
know, just a smidge.

32:17.269 --> 32:18.270
That's it, Dad.

32:18.437 --> 32:19.689
- That's the spirit.
- Yeah.

32:19.855 --> 32:21.448
Back. That's it.

32:21.606 --> 32:24.359
In no way does
this feel natural.

32:24.526 --> 32:27.496
- Now see if you can turn yourself around.
- All right.

32:27.904 --> 32:29.201
Use your flippers.

32:30.365 --> 32:31.662
Whoa! Stop!

32:31.825 --> 32:32.496
Dad!

32:33.118 --> 32:34.870
- Come on, Daddy.
- You can do it.

32:35.036 --> 32:36.162
Oh, jeez!

32:36.329 --> 32:38.172
Daddy! Daddy!

32:43.962 --> 32:44.838
Daddy!

32:45.005 --> 32:45.847
Can you hear me...

32:46.006 --> 32:47.553
Daddy?!

32:50.469 --> 32:52.221
Shane? Darren?

32:52.387 --> 32:53.479
Daddy!

32:53.680 --> 32:54.897
I need youse...

32:55.056 --> 32:56.228
to stay strong.

32:56.433 --> 32:59.653
I know you will, because
you've never let me down.

32:59.811 --> 33:02.030
Penguin, you still there?

33:02.564 --> 33:04.066
Yeah. Right here.

33:04.232 --> 33:08.032
Would you see that me boys get
home safe to their mother?

33:08.236 --> 33:10.034
Daddy.
What are you saying?

33:10.572 --> 33:12.666
Sorry, boys.

33:13.158 --> 33:15.707
They're calling full time
on your old man's career.

33:15.869 --> 33:17.371
- No, Dad! No!
- No, Dad!

33:19.247 --> 33:20.590
Come on. Take a look around.

33:21.249 --> 33:23.092
Can you see any way out?

33:23.919 --> 33:25.216
Yeah. I could grow...

33:25.378 --> 33:26.425
a pair of wings.

33:26.588 --> 33:27.885
Can you move at all?

33:28.048 --> 33:29.925
I'm stuck, mate.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.182
Okay. Everyone...

33:33.345 --> 33:34.767
back from the edge.

33:34.930 --> 33:36.398
Come on, get back from the edge.

33:36.556 --> 33:38.934
All right.
Now don't move till I get back.

33:39.100 --> 33:40.101
Where are you going?

33:40.477 --> 33:42.855
To see what I can
do for their daddy.

33:43.230 --> 33:44.607
What can he do?

33:44.773 --> 33:47.777
He's just an ordinary penguin.

34:06.002 --> 34:09.005
That's one small
step for a krill...

34:09.172 --> 34:11.800
one giant leap for
spineless invertebrates.

34:11.967 --> 34:14.061
Holy mother of krill.

34:14.219 --> 34:17.313
How's your appetite, Bill?
He's a big 'un.

34:28.650 --> 34:30.027
What on earth are you doing?

34:30.193 --> 34:31.739
- I'm stalking.
- You can't...!

34:31.902 --> 34:33.530
- Shh! Shh.
- You can't...

34:33.697 --> 34:35.620
You can't stalk. You're a krill.

34:35.782 --> 34:37.250
We've got to evolve, Bill.

34:37.409 --> 34:41.585
Evolve? Just like that? It's taken us
millions of years just to get this far.

34:41.746 --> 34:45.795
Watch and learn, Billy-boy.
I'm about to naturally select.

34:45.958 --> 34:47.176
No! No, no, no...

34:51.089 --> 34:52.181
<i>Hmm.</i>

34:52.882 --> 34:54.634
A little chewy.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.018
Keenly aromatic.

34:56.177 --> 34:58.851
You just nibbled on its butt.
Don't let it go to your head.

34:59.014 --> 35:01.187
<i>Au contraire, I will
go to its head.</i>

35:01.349 --> 35:02.191
Oh, goodness.

35:02.350 --> 35:06.105
Onward and upward, my friend.
Fresh delicacies await.

35:28.126 --> 35:32.097
Uh, penguin? Is that you?

35:37.969 --> 35:39.516
Streuth.

35:51.858 --> 35:54.202
Oh, penguin.

35:57.238 --> 36:00.583
We're going where no
krill has ever gone before!

36:00.742 --> 36:03.245
Uh-huh.
- We're the stuff of legends, Bill!

36:03.411 --> 36:04.754
Yippie-yi-yo-ki-yay.

36:04.913 --> 36:05.960
How far to the face?

36:06.122 --> 36:07.749
Just ahead!

36:08.249 --> 36:09.216
Hey, you!

36:09.376 --> 36:10.753
Doofus!

36:17.550 --> 36:19.552
Yeah, you. Kelp-sucker.

36:25.100 --> 36:26.602
My mistake.

36:26.768 --> 36:31.524
I thought you were a
ruthless killing machine.

36:33.274 --> 36:35.197
Don't you want a little
taste of penguin?

36:35.360 --> 36:37.454
Stand back, Bill.
This could get messy.

36:59.342 --> 37:00.434
Ha, ha!

37:00.593 --> 37:02.891
He's a fighter!
But he'll drop soon.

37:03.054 --> 37:05.273
It's just the death throes!

37:12.647 --> 37:13.739
Yoo-hoo!

37:17.402 --> 37:18.244
Whoa!

37:20.029 --> 37:21.155
Whoa!

37:22.949 --> 37:24.496
G'day, gorgeous.

37:24.659 --> 37:25.831
I'm sorry.

37:25.994 --> 37:27.246
My mistake.

37:35.587 --> 37:37.009
Dad?

37:41.092 --> 37:42.218
Boys.

37:42.510 --> 37:44.103
Pa. It worked.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.061
SvenTHINK.

37:51.895 --> 37:55.695
Oh, yeah! Did you see the look in his eyes?
Mortal terror!

37:55.857 --> 37:57.074
You said he was finished.

37:57.233 --> 37:59.361
- I spared his despicable life!
- What?

37:59.527 --> 38:01.404
He'll tell his friends.
Spread the fear.

38:01.571 --> 38:04.199
There's a new predator in town!
Sching!

38:04.365 --> 38:05.366
You're insane.

38:05.533 --> 38:08.878
Someone's gotta keep their numbers
down, Bill, and we are that someone.

38:09.037 --> 38:09.913
Oh, boy.

38:10.079 --> 38:12.423
<i>We are the
champions, my friend.</i>

38:12.582 --> 38:14.880
<i>And we'll keep on
fighting till the end.</i>

38:15.043 --> 38:15.919
Listen to yourself.

38:16.085 --> 38:18.508
<i>Me are the champion
Me are the champion.</i>

38:18.671 --> 38:21.345
Delusional singing!
Will, it's the first sign of madness.

38:21.508 --> 38:23.055
<i>Me are the champion.</i>

38:24.135 --> 38:25.978
- How's that shoulder?
- Yeah, it's okay.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.060
Yeah, get some ice on it.
You'll be right.

38:28.223 --> 38:29.691
- Thanks.
- No.

38:29.849 --> 38:30.725
Thank you.

38:30.892 --> 38:34.738
Thanks to you, chief, Beachmaster
Bryan gets to play another season.

38:34.896 --> 38:37.365
I reckon that makes you an
honorary elephant seal.

38:37.524 --> 38:38.696
What do you reckon, boys?

38:38.858 --> 38:42.032
Thank you, Your Honor, for
giving us our daddy back.

38:42.195 --> 38:44.744
- Yeah. Cheers, Bryan.
- I owe you one, my friend.

38:44.906 --> 38:45.998
No.

38:46.157 --> 38:48.535
I mean it.
All you have to do is ask.

38:48.993 --> 38:51.621
Any time, any place.

38:51.788 --> 38:53.711
No worries. Okay?

38:53.873 --> 38:55.341
No worries.

38:55.500 --> 38:56.922
Okay.

38:57.335 --> 39:00.589
Come on, nippers.
Let's get youse home.

39:01.548 --> 39:02.925
- All right.
- Both of youse.

39:03.091 --> 39:04.809
- On you hop, Shane-0.
- Come on, guys.

39:04.968 --> 39:07.266
Go on, Daggy, up you get.

39:19.023 --> 39:20.195
We lost, ain't we?

39:20.358 --> 39:22.156
Atticus, we're not lost.

39:22.318 --> 39:24.537
- Emperor Land should be right here.
- Yeah.

39:24.696 --> 39:26.414
My instincts are never wrong.

39:26.573 --> 39:31.830
You all are crazy. I know for a fact
the Emperor-hood is one day that way.

39:31.995 --> 39:33.872
No, that way.

39:35.039 --> 39:36.461
Oh, my goodness!

39:39.168 --> 39:41.045
Oh, no.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.766
Hey, look!
Somebody got out!

39:52.932 --> 39:55.060
Aye, you see!
I knew there was a way!

39:55.226 --> 39:56.978
Hey, buddy,
how do we get out?!

39:57.145 --> 39:58.146
I don't know!

39:58.313 --> 39:59.656
I'm trying to get in!

39:59.814 --> 40:00.440
Mumble!

40:00.607 --> 40:01.449
Mumble!

40:01.608 --> 40:02.450
Yo! Dad!

40:02.609 --> 40:05.738
Atticus, my man!
Good to see y'all still kicking!

40:05.904 --> 40:07.121
What happened?

40:07.280 --> 40:11.251
That big old iceberg you on came
thumping and bumping, and here we are!

40:11.409 --> 40:12.501
That's messed up!

40:12.660 --> 40:14.287
Nothing
we can't fix, dear!

40:14.454 --> 40:15.296
Mommy!

40:15.455 --> 40:17.253
I told
them all to chillax!

40:17.415 --> 40:18.837
I knew you'd be fine!

40:19.000 --> 40:20.001
Where's Mommy?

40:20.168 --> 40:21.795
Has anyone seen Gloria?

40:23.421 --> 40:26.015
Mumble! Erik!

40:26.174 --> 40:27.175
- Mom!
- Gloria!

40:27.425 --> 40:28.677
My beautiful boys.

40:28.843 --> 40:30.345
Thought I'd never see you again.

40:30.511 --> 40:31.979
Gotta be a way to get you out.

40:32.138 --> 40:34.561
Honey, there are search
parties everywhere.

40:34.724 --> 40:37.102
If there's a way
out, we're gonna find it.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.269
Don't worry, Daddy!

40:38.436 --> 40:41.940
Today Uncle Mumble got a big
old elephant seal out of...

40:42.106 --> 40:43.403
a big black hole!

40:43.566 --> 40:46.490
Yeah. But that was a
whole lot different!

40:46.653 --> 40:47.700
But you did.

40:47.862 --> 40:50.615
Mumble!
Can you get us a couple of fish for my kids?

40:50.782 --> 40:53.035
- Mine too!
- Over here!

40:53.201 --> 40:55.124
Okay. I'll do what I can.

40:55.286 --> 40:58.005
- What about my family?
- Hey, don't forget us!

41:03.503 --> 41:05.801
Hey, hey! Hey, listen.

41:05.964 --> 41:08.308
There is a way to feed
a whole lot of you.

41:08.466 --> 41:12.312
I'm going to Adelie Land.
Bring back some friends.

41:12.470 --> 41:13.847
You'll have to be patient...

41:14.013 --> 41:15.640
okay?

41:15.807 --> 41:17.229
Bo, where are you going?

41:17.392 --> 41:19.144
I'm taking the shortcut.

41:19.310 --> 41:21.984
- No, you're not. You're staying here.
- But I'm very fast.

41:22.522 --> 41:24.695
- Erik?
- Be cool. She's a freerunner.

41:26.234 --> 41:29.204
Sorry, Erik.
One's faster than two.

41:29.362 --> 41:31.364
Boadicea, do
you have a tail feather?

41:31.531 --> 41:32.828
Yes, I have a tail feather.

41:32.991 --> 41:34.038
Then you...

41:34.200 --> 41:35.247
shake it, my dear!

41:35.410 --> 41:37.037
- Booya!
- But, Miss Viola...

41:37.203 --> 41:39.501
there are all kinds
of dangers out there.

41:39.664 --> 41:41.541
Not dangers, challenges!

41:41.708 --> 41:43.176
Now that's the spirit!

41:44.460 --> 41:47.714
Okay. Okay. Find Uncle Ramon.

41:47.880 --> 41:51.601
<i>Tell him to bring the amigos and
as many Adelies as he can. And...</i>

41:51.759 --> 41:54.057
And always remember
the family motto:

41:54.220 --> 41:56.598
Just let rip!

42:11.320 --> 42:14.950
Come on, Uncle Mumble.
We got some fishing to do.

42:39.724 --> 42:41.476
So, what news have you?

42:41.642 --> 42:45.818
Every nook and cranny, every
which way, completely blocked.

42:45.980 --> 42:47.823
There's a lot of talk out there.

42:47.982 --> 42:50.076
- Thinking the unthinkable.
- Yeah.

42:50.234 --> 42:52.362
Noah, they're calling
this the 'Berg of Doom.

42:52.528 --> 42:53.700
How will we answer that?

42:53.863 --> 42:55.615
- We look again.
- We can't just keep...

42:55.782 --> 42:57.750
We go back and we
search a hundred times.

42:57.909 --> 42:59.001
There is no way out!

42:59.160 --> 43:01.788
A thousand times if we have to.
There's always a way!

43:02.538 --> 43:04.882
Yeah, that's it, right there.

43:05.041 --> 43:06.088
The <i>ice</i>

43:07.668 --> 43:09.716
<i>The ice sounds nice Check one.</i>

43:10.296 --> 43:12.719
<i>The ice Ice sounds nice.</i>

43:13.549 --> 43:15.847
Here. Let me help you.

43:17.929 --> 43:20.273
Okay. Now let it go.

43:20.932 --> 43:21.979
Wait... Erik!

43:22.141 --> 43:23.518
No! Slow down!

43:24.727 --> 43:26.695
Jump! Jump off!

43:28.314 --> 43:29.987
Whoa!

43:35.863 --> 43:37.206
Did you see me? Did you?

43:37.365 --> 43:39.333
Don't ever do that again!

43:39.492 --> 43:41.540
Daddy, I was flying!

43:41.702 --> 43:43.454
- Aw, Erik.
- Really flying!

43:43.621 --> 43:47.046
I flapped my wings super
fast and I went uppity-up!

43:47.208 --> 43:48.551
Son, we're penguins.

43:48.709 --> 43:49.426
We can't fly.

43:49.585 --> 43:51.553
But Sven is a penguin.

43:51.712 --> 43:55.558
I don't know what kind of penguin Sven is,
but we are Emperor penguins. We can't...

43:55.716 --> 43:58.219
But if everyone could learn
to fly, Mommy can...

43:58.386 --> 43:59.683
get out of there!

43:59.846 --> 44:02.474
- Hey.
- I don't know if there's a way out!

44:02.640 --> 44:03.641
Know... way out!

44:03.808 --> 44:04.559
Hey!

44:04.725 --> 44:06.853
But if there is, it sure
as eggs ain't flying.

44:07.562 --> 44:09.109
If you want it,
you must will it!

44:09.272 --> 44:11.821
And if you will it,
it will be yours!

44:11.983 --> 44:14.236
Aw, Erik, get real.
They're trapped.

44:16.612 --> 44:18.080
They're hungry, afraid.

44:19.073 --> 44:20.199
The last thing anyone...

44:20.366 --> 44:22.494
needs is false hope!

44:23.244 --> 44:24.245
Boys?

44:25.288 --> 44:26.790
Then they'll die.

44:27.540 --> 44:28.166
Boys...

44:28.332 --> 44:30.130
what's going on with you two?

44:31.711 --> 44:32.963
Just working things out.

44:33.129 --> 44:34.130
Erik?

44:34.297 --> 44:36.220
We need some mother love, Ms. G.

44:36.716 --> 44:38.468
He's about to explode!

44:38.634 --> 44:40.102
Mumble, why
don't you go...

44:40.261 --> 44:41.558
catch some fish?

44:42.763 --> 44:43.605
He ain't hungry...

44:43.764 --> 44:45.107
Ms. G.

44:45.433 --> 44:46.275
It's okay, Atticus.

44:46.434 --> 44:47.310
I got it.

44:47.476 --> 44:48.978
I got it!

44:49.478 --> 44:51.856
Okay, fishing.

44:52.023 --> 44:54.776
Erik, just let it go.

44:54.942 --> 44:57.240
Erik, calm down!

44:57.403 --> 45:00.623
Sweetie, take a step back.

45:02.783 --> 45:03.955
Close your eyes.

45:05.286 --> 45:06.788
Deep breath.

45:06.954 --> 45:09.457
Come on, it's easy.

45:12.126 --> 45:14.470
<i>Just when you think.</i>

45:15.796 --> 45:17.924
<i>Hope is lost.</i>

45:18.966 --> 45:21.435
<i>And giving UP</i>

45:22.470 --> 45:24.768
<i>ls all you got.</i>

45:26.057 --> 45:28.776
<i>Blue turns black.</i>

45:29.852 --> 45:32.150
<i>Your confidence is cracked.</i>

45:32.897 --> 45:36.868
<i>There seems no turnin'
back from here.</i>

45:40.238 --> 45:42.366
<i>When your feet.</i>

45:43.407 --> 45:45.876
<i>Are made of stone.</i>

45:46.994 --> 45:49.998
<i>And you're convinced.</i>

45:50.164 --> 45:52.508
<i>That you're all alone.</i>

45:54.168 --> 45:56.341
<i>Look at the stars.</i>

45:57.171 --> 45:59.515
<i>Instead of the dark.</i>

46:00.883 --> 46:02.806
<i>You'll find your heart.</i>

46:02.969 --> 46:06.519
<i>Shines like the sun.</i>

46:07.932 --> 46:12.733
<i>Let's not let our
anger get us lost.</i>

46:14.605 --> 46:16.198
<i>And the need to be right.</i>

46:16.357 --> 46:20.237
<i>Comes with way too high a cost.</i>

46:21.821 --> 46:24.040
<i>That's when you can build.</i>

46:24.198 --> 46:25.700
<i>A bridge of light.</i>

46:25.866 --> 46:29.086
<i>That's what turns the
wrongs all right.</i>

46:29.245 --> 46:30.918
<i>That's when you know.</i>

46:31.080 --> 46:32.627
<i>It's worth the fight.</i>

46:35.835 --> 46:38.714
<i>That's when love
Turns nighttime.</i>

46:38.879 --> 46:39.721
<i>Into day.</i>

46:39.880 --> 46:42.929
<i>That's when loneliness
goes away.</i>

46:43.718 --> 46:48.144
<i>That's why you gotta
be strong This night</i>

46:49.640 --> 46:51.893
<i>'Cause only love can build us.</i>

46:52.059 --> 46:52.901
<i>A bridge</i>

46:53.060 --> 46:55.904
<i>or light</i>

47:00.776 --> 47:03.655
<i>Deep breath, take it.</i>

47:03.821 --> 47:05.539
<i>On the chin.</i>

47:06.991 --> 47:09.369
<i>But don't forget.</i>

47:09.994 --> 47:13.248
<i>To let love back in.</i>

47:14.165 --> 47:16.213
<i>That's when love can build.</i>

47:16.375 --> 47:17.968
<i>A bridge of light.</i>

47:18.127 --> 47:21.427
<i>That's what turns the
wrongs all right.</i>

47:21.589 --> 47:23.091
<i>That's when you can't.</i>

47:23.257 --> 47:27.103
<i>Give up the fight.</i>

47:27.845 --> 47:31.770
<i>And that's when love Turns
nighttime into day.</i>

47:31.932 --> 47:35.527
<i>That's when loneliness
goes away.</i>

47:35.686 --> 47:37.108
<i>That's why you gotta.</i>

47:37.271 --> 47:41.242
<i>Be strong tonight</i>

47:41.817 --> 47:44.115
<i>'Cause only love can build us.</i>

47:44.278 --> 47:48.624
<i>A bridge of light.</i>

47:48.908 --> 47:51.036
<i>Only love can build us.</i>

47:51.202 --> 47:55.048
<i>A bridge of light.</i>

47:55.998 --> 47:59.093
<i>Only love can build us.</i>

48:01.712 --> 48:04.181
<i>A bridge of light</i>

48:04.340 --> 48:06.468
Will? Will?

48:06.634 --> 48:07.430
Hm?

48:07.593 --> 48:09.766
- You asleep yet?
- Mm-hm. Deeply.

48:09.929 --> 48:11.852
Well,
then wake up and tell me:

48:12.014 --> 48:13.561
Is that the swarm
or am I dreaming?

48:13.724 --> 48:15.476
You're dreaming.

48:25.236 --> 48:27.614
Wow, how wonderful.

48:27.780 --> 48:30.249
I wonder if they're edible.

48:33.661 --> 48:35.083
Aww.

48:35.913 --> 48:39.463
Will, don't you long for the patter
of a thousand tiny little feet?

48:39.625 --> 48:42.299
I, for one, don't have the means
to bring up so many kids.

48:42.461 --> 48:43.929
The birthday presents alone...

48:44.088 --> 48:45.894
I've already

48:45.895 --> 48:48.184
Phil, Jill, Lill, Gill, Hil,
Billy, Lilly, Willy...

48:48.342 --> 48:50.640
- All right.
- Wilma, Willis, Wilbur, Wilhelmina...

48:50.803 --> 48:51.725
I get the picture.

48:51.887 --> 48:53.230
And there's even a Will.

48:53.389 --> 48:54.390
Good for you.

48:54.557 --> 48:56.184
We could start a little swarm.

48:56.350 --> 48:57.693
We're both males.

48:57.852 --> 48:58.444
We'll adopt.

48:58.602 --> 49:01.401
You adopt, I'll adapt.
I've got slaughtering to do.

49:01.564 --> 49:04.989
Fine, that's just fine! Off you go then.
Quench your blood lust.

49:05.151 --> 49:07.529
There's plenty more
krill in the sea.

49:09.196 --> 49:13.076
Plenty of krill would count themselves
lucky to have me as a partner.

49:13.242 --> 49:15.290
I'm a heck of a wingman!

49:27.756 --> 49:29.008
Will.

49:29.258 --> 49:30.510
Will?

49:32.219 --> 49:34.187
- Hey.
- Hey.

49:34.346 --> 49:36.064
You're all the
swarm I've got.

49:36.223 --> 49:39.193
Suit yourself.
But no hanky-panky.

50:30.110 --> 50:31.157
Are you hurt?

50:31.320 --> 50:34.290
No, I'm good. I'm okay.
It's okay.

50:34.448 --> 50:36.121
Aw, come on, Seymour,
take a break.

50:36.283 --> 50:40.663
No. No, no, thanks, brother.
My boy is out there.

50:45.626 --> 50:46.627
Oh, no.

50:54.802 --> 50:55.974
Erik! Atticus!

50:56.136 --> 50:57.137
Take cover!

50:57.429 --> 50:59.306
Come on, Erik. Over here.

51:02.810 --> 51:04.812
Waddle,
waddle, waddle.

51:04.979 --> 51:06.981
Oh, if only I could fly!

51:07.147 --> 51:09.149
Boo-hoo-hoo!

51:09.358 --> 51:10.701
Oh, look at this.

51:10.859 --> 51:13.988
My all-time favorite.
Doomed penguin packed in ice.

51:14.154 --> 51:15.201
All you can eat.

51:15.364 --> 51:16.832
Forever.

51:17.283 --> 51:19.502
I've never seen so many
skuas in one place.

51:19.660 --> 51:21.287
Stand together. Hold fast.

51:21.453 --> 51:24.206
- They know. They sense it!
- We're never getting out of here!

51:24.373 --> 51:25.670
They're scavengers.
Cowards!

51:25.833 --> 51:27.210
They prey only on the weak.

51:27.376 --> 51:29.378
Admit it, Noah!
We're all dead meat!

51:29.587 --> 51:31.339
No! We are Emperor penguins!

51:31.505 --> 51:32.506
Quite right!

51:32.673 --> 51:36.519
Though we stare famine in the
face, we will not yield!

51:36.677 --> 51:38.179
- Ha, ha!
- Though imprisoned...

51:38.345 --> 51:40.689
on every side by
colossal walls of ice...

51:40.848 --> 51:42.850
we will not be broken!

51:43.017 --> 51:44.690
Yes, sir. Speak on it, Noah!

51:44.852 --> 51:46.695
We are fortitude!

51:46.854 --> 51:49.198
We are bold defiance!

51:49.356 --> 51:53.156
We are one glorious
Emperor nation!

52:17.051 --> 52:18.223
No!

52:33.567 --> 52:35.069
Erik, stay down!

52:35.736 --> 52:37.033
Mumble?

52:37.404 --> 52:38.405
They're okay.

52:38.781 --> 52:40.078
Gloria, behind you!

52:40.240 --> 52:41.082
Hey!

52:41.450 --> 52:43.623
Pick on someone your
own size, creep!

52:43.786 --> 52:45.208
Oh, I will, princess.

52:45.371 --> 52:47.248
I'll peck on you first.

52:47.414 --> 52:50.167
While you're still fresh.
Before you're stiff and stinky!

52:53.420 --> 52:54.672
Bo!

53:01.303 --> 53:02.600
Bo!

53:25.077 --> 53:26.750
- That's my girl.
- Oh, yeah.

53:26.912 --> 53:28.255
Well done, you.

53:28.414 --> 53:30.087
Ah, the gathering of nations.

53:30.624 --> 53:32.922
Now that's solidarity!

53:33.293 --> 53:34.465
Okay, so...

53:34.628 --> 53:38.383
So they got
themselves a temporary stay...

53:38.549 --> 53:39.641
of execution. Ow!

53:39.800 --> 53:41.017
- What are you?
- An idiot.

53:41.176 --> 53:42.177
Thank you.

53:42.344 --> 53:43.846
Bo! Oh, you did it.

53:44.012 --> 53:44.763
Whoo!

53:44.930 --> 53:46.648
- She is fast.
- Hola, amigos!

53:46.890 --> 53:48.312
- Mumble!
- Mumble!

53:48.475 --> 53:50.318
- You came!
- Of course we came.

53:50.477 --> 53:52.070
- We heard the news.
- Where's Ramon?

53:52.229 --> 53:54.323
- No longer with us.
- He's in a better place.

53:54.481 --> 53:55.983
Carmen!

53:56.650 --> 53:58.402
We got you, man.

53:59.027 --> 54:01.655
Carmen. Carmen, no. No, wait!

54:03.615 --> 54:05.993
I wouldn't want you to get
cold feet, my darling.

54:06.160 --> 54:07.457
I am not your darling.

54:07.619 --> 54:08.836
See? What did I tell you?

54:08.996 --> 54:10.964
No backbone. All squishy.

54:11.123 --> 54:14.172
Hey, back off!
I'm a Carmen-only facility.

54:14.334 --> 54:15.506
Ramon, it's incredible.

54:15.794 --> 54:16.841
Everybody came.

54:17.004 --> 54:18.847
Except for that guy who
stayed, he had the sniffles.

54:19.798 --> 54:21.015
Oh, no, he's here.

54:21.175 --> 54:22.677
You're a true friend. Thank you.

54:22.843 --> 54:24.265
I had nothing to do with it.

54:24.428 --> 54:26.851
Well, then, Lovelace,
thank you so much.

54:28.182 --> 54:29.525
You got the wrong penguin.

54:29.683 --> 54:32.027
Hello! Hidy-do-dee-doody there.

54:32.186 --> 54:34.405
- I knew it.
- Ah, little Ear-rik.

54:35.522 --> 54:36.398
Excusing me.

54:36.565 --> 54:40.365
Okay. Friends of Sven, and
fans, and chums and Svenatics!

54:40.527 --> 54:44.373
We're not going to rest
until everybody fatty!

54:44.698 --> 54:45.995
Okay.

55:22.236 --> 55:23.283
Yeah!

55:34.331 --> 55:35.583
Hello!

55:36.792 --> 55:39.295
Heh, hey! You huddled masses.

55:39.461 --> 55:44.092
I bring you fish aplenty
courtesy of me!

55:44.258 --> 55:46.602
Yeah!
Give them the real, brother!

55:52.474 --> 55:53.600
Who is this guy?

55:53.767 --> 55:56.270
They call him Sven.
He's Sventastic.

55:56.436 --> 55:59.280
Let me revert back to what
I previously said before.

55:59.439 --> 56:00.907
- Ow!
- You're an idiot.

56:01.358 --> 56:02.780
- And guess what.
- What?

56:02.943 --> 56:05.617
He can carry more fish
than any penguin that ever...

56:05.779 --> 56:06.371
existed.

56:06.530 --> 56:07.281
Wow.

56:07.447 --> 56:10.291
And it's all due to his
amazingly large red beak.

56:10.450 --> 56:11.576
Impressive.

56:11.994 --> 56:13.996
Sven? Sven?

56:14.204 --> 56:14.955
<i>Ja? Ja?</i>

56:15.122 --> 56:17.420
There's someone down there
who's very special.

56:17.583 --> 56:19.927
And knowing Gloria,
she won't eat...

56:20.085 --> 56:21.962
- ...until everyone else has been fed.
- Aww.

56:22.129 --> 56:24.473
Do you think you could
take this down to her?

56:24.631 --> 56:26.429
Yeah, don't be silly.
Where is he?

56:26.592 --> 56:28.139
- No, she.
- Oh.

56:28.302 --> 56:30.179
There, surrounded
by the children.

56:30.387 --> 56:32.014
- That is your spouse?
- Yes.

56:32.180 --> 56:34.148
- Your spouse? Wow.
- Here. The fish.

56:34.308 --> 56:38.313
Oh, no, no, Mumbley.
She deserves the very best.

56:38.478 --> 56:39.104
A la carte.

56:39.855 --> 56:42.199
A la me!

56:42.983 --> 56:44.701
So you want some music?

56:44.902 --> 56:45.528
Nope.

56:45.694 --> 56:46.991
Let's have some music.

56:47.195 --> 56:49.493
<i>A-wake me
up before you go-go.</i>

56:49.656 --> 56:52.159
<i>Cause I'm not plannin'
on going solo.</i>

56:52.326 --> 56:54.328
<i>A-wake me up before you go-go.</i>

56:54.494 --> 56:55.495
Can you keep it down?

56:55.662 --> 56:56.663
<i>I wanna hit that high.</i>

56:56.830 --> 56:58.628
Just be quiet!

56:58.916 --> 57:00.589
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

57:02.961 --> 57:04.679
<i>I'm never gonna give you up.</i>

57:04.838 --> 57:06.715
<i>Never gonna let you down.</i>

57:06.882 --> 57:09.010
- Whoa!
- A predator convention?

57:09.176 --> 57:09.847
Oh, no.

57:10.010 --> 57:11.512
- Why wasn't I invited?
- Will.

57:11.678 --> 57:13.772
- Guys? Guys.
- Will, don't go.

57:14.139 --> 57:15.686
- Get off.
- You'll never survive.

57:15.849 --> 57:17.851
- Please.
- Will? Stop!

57:20.020 --> 57:21.522
I think we should split up.

57:21.688 --> 57:25.067
Oh, well, I mean, if it's personal
space you want, how's that?

57:25.233 --> 57:28.954
No, no. I mean, really split up.

57:29.237 --> 57:31.365
But why?

57:32.366 --> 57:35.370
Ah, Bill, this is my life now.

57:35.577 --> 57:36.874
I can change.

57:37.037 --> 57:38.710
Be smaller, invisible.

57:38.872 --> 57:42.922
See? You're gonna be just fine.
I'll see you around, kiddo.

57:47.172 --> 57:51.723
Will? Please. Don't leave me.

57:55.222 --> 57:57.441
- Aah!
- Will! Will!

57:57.599 --> 58:00.523
Okay, let's take
you, you, not you, you.

58:00.686 --> 58:01.903
Oh. you!

58:03.188 --> 58:05.737
Please! Somebody! Anybody!

58:05.899 --> 58:07.242
I've lost my Will!

58:07.401 --> 58:08.277
I beg you!

58:08.443 --> 58:12.698
Bring back my Will!

58:26.545 --> 58:27.592
Mumbley!

58:27.754 --> 58:29.347
- Ah, Sven.
- Mumbley.

58:30.382 --> 58:33.886
- I feed your wife good-y, ja?
- Yeah, thanks.

58:34.636 --> 58:36.434
Okay, Sven, here we go.

58:36.596 --> 58:39.065
Okay, single file with a smile.

58:39.433 --> 58:41.936
So you must be Glorious.

58:42.102 --> 58:44.150
Heh, heh. And you must be Sven.

58:44.312 --> 58:46.064
So pleased to meet me. Really...

58:46.231 --> 58:47.904
I am delightful.

58:50.110 --> 58:54.581
I bring to you premium
seafood, yeah, from Mumbley.

58:54.740 --> 58:56.037
- There he is.
- Hey.

58:56.241 --> 58:57.493
Via Sven.

58:57.659 --> 58:58.911
Wow.

59:04.833 --> 59:06.050
Careful.

59:06.209 --> 59:07.131
That's my tongue.

59:07.294 --> 59:10.798
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's all right. Whoo!

59:10.964 --> 59:11.806
Oh, yeah.

59:11.965 --> 59:14.684
You know, if you are not
feeling a full Svensation...

59:16.261 --> 59:17.979
I can get you more.

59:19.056 --> 59:22.310
No, no, Sven. I'm sure there are
many others hungrier than me.

59:23.560 --> 59:26.484
Ah. Such a noble.
See you for supper?

59:26.646 --> 59:28.319
Um, I'm kind of busy.

59:28.482 --> 59:30.826
Heh. "Kind of busy."

59:34.196 --> 59:35.869
Oh, you're funny!

59:38.075 --> 59:39.327
Whoo!

59:40.160 --> 59:41.878
She is a hottie!

59:42.079 --> 59:44.002
Honey, are you okay?

59:44.456 --> 59:47.084
Are you sure he's not
related to Ramon'?

59:47.501 --> 59:49.503
Oh, you're funny!

59:51.004 --> 59:54.008
You shouldn't make fun of someone
just because they're different.

59:54.174 --> 59:56.302
Especially someone who's
come all this way...

59:56.468 --> 59:57.970
- ...to save us.
- You're right.

59:58.136 --> 01:00:02.061
- And when Sven teaches everyone to fly...
- It'll be up-uppity-up.

01:00:02.224 --> 01:00:04.397
- And out of there.
- You'll see.

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:06.478
Hey, who turned off the fish?

01:00:06.645 --> 01:00:09.148
Hey, guys!
What's happening to the fish?

01:00:10.774 --> 01:00:12.776
Yoo-hoo!

01:00:12.943 --> 01:00:14.035
Fish-y friends!

01:00:14.194 --> 01:00:16.071
What is problem?

01:00:19.533 --> 01:00:20.705
The bird-eaters!

01:00:21.785 --> 01:00:24.379
Svensei! You must fly
on the wings of hope...

01:00:24.538 --> 01:00:27.257
and summon them to the aid
of our Emperor brothers!

01:00:27.415 --> 01:00:29.964
You know, I would love to,
but I just hurt my tongue.

01:00:30.127 --> 01:00:31.629
No.

01:00:34.381 --> 01:00:35.428
What?

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:37.388
Ciao. Hmm.
Interesting.

01:00:37.551 --> 01:00:39.895
Someone better do something.
They're not stopping.

01:00:40.053 --> 01:00:43.182
Don't worry. I know exactly
how to get the attention...

01:00:43.348 --> 01:00:45.066
of our alien benefactors.

01:00:57.028 --> 01:01:00.248
Calm down. Deep breath.
Deep breath.

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:18.322
Lovelace!

01:02:18.485 --> 01:02:22.831
Mumble, my man! I'm the mayor
me!

01:02:22.989 --> 01:02:25.162
This is great.

01:02:30.664 --> 01:02:33.338
Ah. Can you believe this?

01:02:40.507 --> 01:02:42.851
Where's there a
Will, there's a way out!

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:56.277
Hm?

01:03:07.993 --> 01:03:08.915
Huh?

01:03:26.219 --> 01:03:28.813
Bill? Is that you?

01:03:36.896 --> 01:03:41.402
I don't know, Uncle Mumble.
They're noisy and they're messing with our ice.

01:03:41.568 --> 01:03:43.821
Atticus, they're building
us a way out of here.

01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:45.239
ATTICUS Oh.

01:03:45.739 --> 01:03:49.619
Everybody who said we'd never
get out of here, take a look!

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:52.579
That's our ice road to freedom.

01:03:54.372 --> 01:03:55.965
It won't be long now, boys.

01:03:56.416 --> 01:03:57.963
I'll miss this place.

01:03:58.126 --> 01:04:00.629
So where will we live
when everybody gets out?

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:03.764
We'll find somewhere new, sweetheart.
It's a big world.

01:04:03.923 --> 01:04:06.767
As long as we're together,
we already home.

01:04:06.926 --> 01:04:07.973
Yeah.

01:04:47.967 --> 01:04:50.095
Come on, everyone. Huddle up.

01:05:01.147 --> 01:05:03.991
Oh, no, no, no!

01:05:15.995 --> 01:05:18.339
Carmen, can't you see?

01:05:18.498 --> 01:05:21.923
Even nature decrees that
we be close together.

01:05:51.573 --> 01:05:53.575
Mm. Yeah.

01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:57.628
No, no, no.

01:06:13.887 --> 01:06:15.764
Oh, you are still here.

01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:17.807
And you're still here.

01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:19.226
- They're gone.
- What?

01:06:19.392 --> 01:06:21.144
A little bad
weather, they're gone!

01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:22.733
- What's going on?
- Who's gone?

01:06:22.896 --> 01:06:24.239
- The aliens!
- What?

01:06:24.397 --> 01:06:27.321
All of this flipperizing
for nothing!

01:06:44.834 --> 01:06:46.177
Our alien
benefactors...

01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:47.758
have abandoned us!

01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:50.140
They have abandoned us!

01:06:50.298 --> 01:06:52.767
Everybody! Everybody!

01:06:52.926 --> 01:06:55.930
The sea is frozen over, ja?

01:06:56.095 --> 01:06:58.939
Impossible for aliens to return!

01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:01.142
Too much ice-y. Too much ice-y.

01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:04.313
If the sea so far
away, how we gonna catch food?

01:07:04.479 --> 01:07:06.732
Yeah, what's the
point of us starving too?

01:07:06.898 --> 01:07:09.447
- I guess we should be going.
- We can't just leave them.

01:07:09.609 --> 01:07:11.486
- I think they're leaving.
- Who's leaving?

01:07:11.653 --> 01:07:13.997
- It appears that we...
- What is he saying?

01:07:14.155 --> 01:07:15.748
I regret to inform...

01:07:15.907 --> 01:07:19.207
we are no longer in the
catering businesses.

01:07:20.745 --> 01:07:23.294
Then who will
bring us fish?

01:07:23.456 --> 01:07:26.630
Some good questions
have no good answers.

01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:31.264
Sven, they can't leave!

01:07:31.422 --> 01:07:32.844
Not now!

01:07:33.132 --> 01:07:35.635
I so sorry, fluffy one.
If they stay...

01:07:36.135 --> 01:07:39.264
then they, too,
become not alive.

01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:42.309
Ah! I can't take it!
I can't take it any more!

01:07:42.475 --> 01:07:44.398
Out of my way!
I'm getting out of here!

01:07:54.153 --> 01:07:55.780
Whoa, that guy was crazy.

01:07:55.947 --> 01:07:57.415
Yeah. So am I.

01:07:57.991 --> 01:07:59.664
Come on, girls. Let's do it.

01:07:59.826 --> 01:08:00.372
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:08:00.535 --> 01:08:03.505
Go, go, go!

01:08:06.666 --> 01:08:09.340
Sven. Teach them.
Teach them how to fly!

01:08:09.502 --> 01:08:11.254
Ear-rik, it's not that easy.

01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:14.177
Help them, Sven. Help them!

01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:16.763
But not all penguins
created equal, Ear-rik.

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:18.678
- But you're a penguin.
- I a..

01:08:19.178 --> 01:08:20.850
I a little more than penguin.

01:08:21.014 --> 01:08:22.310
I a... I is a...

01:08:22.473 --> 01:08:24.395
Look! They're halfway there!

01:08:24.559 --> 01:08:25.354
Come on, Sven.

01:08:25.518 --> 01:08:26.986
Take them high to the sky!

01:08:27.604 --> 01:08:28.856
Do it, Sven!

01:08:29.022 --> 01:08:30.399
- Do it, brother!
- No, I can't!

01:08:30.564 --> 01:08:32.067
- Do it!
- They're penguins!

01:08:32.233 --> 01:08:33.154
You're a penguin!

01:08:33.318 --> 01:08:34.569
I'm a bird!

01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:35.778
You're a what?

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:37.287
A bir... den.

01:08:37.447 --> 01:08:39.575
- What?
- Den. A burden.

01:08:39.741 --> 01:08:41.835
If <i>I</i> don't try. Ia?

01:08:42.285 --> 01:08:44.412
Ja, ja, after all...

01:08:44.578 --> 01:08:46.752
- it's just technique, right?
- Yes!

01:08:46.913 --> 01:08:48.381
Okay.

01:08:48.832 --> 01:08:51.176
Everybody! Head up!
Back straight!

01:08:54.212 --> 01:08:57.216
Okay. Feel the wind
beneath your wings!

01:08:57.383 --> 01:08:58.305
UP-uppity-up!

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:03.144
Oh, boy.
Rotate flippers and sing, sing!

01:09:17.403 --> 01:09:18.620
This time...

01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:20.999
you going down, gravity!

01:09:21.616 --> 01:09:23.288
Ja, ja, okay. ja...

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:26.162
Atticus, my man, I'm coming!

01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:32.251
Fly, Daddy...

01:09:32.417 --> 01:09:33.385
- ...fly!
- Fly!

01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:34.962
<i>Ja! Ja!</i>

01:09:36.589 --> 01:09:37.841
Come on, guys. Come on.

01:09:38.006 --> 01:09:41.136
If you want it, you must will it!
If you will it, it will be yours!

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:48.397
on, Daddy.

01:09:55.858 --> 01:09:58.577
Today is a victory...

01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:01.372
for defeat.

01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:05.331
Oh, mighty Sven, you did
everything penguinly possible.

01:10:05.493 --> 01:10:08.042
I is not a penguin.
- What?

01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:10.002
I is a puffin.

01:10:10.957 --> 01:10:11.799
- Wow.
- Really?

01:10:11.958 --> 01:10:15.508
Ja, just a little puffin
bird run out of poof.

01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:16.671
No.

01:10:16.838 --> 01:10:19.261
Bravo, Lovelace.
You brought us a weird bird...

01:10:19.424 --> 01:10:22.644
and sold him as a penguin.
Ha, ha. Bravo, bravo.

01:10:22.802 --> 01:10:25.305
- Hey. Hey.
- Thank you. I deserved it.

01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:33.105
I'm sorry, everybody.
I'm so sorry.

01:10:33.312 --> 01:10:37.033
But when I lose my homelands...

01:10:37.191 --> 01:10:41.321
I was very lonely
and very afraid-y.

01:10:41.696 --> 01:10:44.620
And then I meet you
and you believe...

01:10:44.824 --> 01:10:46.076
in me, Sven.

01:10:47.952 --> 01:10:51.456
Oh.
It was nice to have a family.

01:10:52.707 --> 01:10:53.299
Thank you.

01:10:55.209 --> 01:10:58.964
Eh, up-up-uppity

01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:32.459
Hey, guys, we should try this.

01:11:32.872 --> 01:11:33.714
Huh?

01:11:34.832 --> 01:11:35.458
Ah.

01:11:35.625 --> 01:11:37.047
Okay.

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:43.179
Now, come on. Everyone together.

01:11:44.008 --> 01:11:45.476
- You know.
- Tippity-tap!

01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:47.057
- Boomedy-boom!
- Let's do it!

01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:49.939
Come on! Everybody!

01:11:50.932 --> 01:11:52.525
We're doomed and
they're dancing?

01:11:52.683 --> 01:11:54.060
Unbelievable.

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:02.277
That's it.

01:12:42.942 --> 01:12:43.943
Huh?

01:13:12.805 --> 01:13:14.057
Atticus!

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:15.691
- Mommy!
- Oh, Boadicea!

01:13:15.850 --> 01:13:17.397
Are you all right'?

01:13:19.562 --> 01:13:20.654
Help me!

01:13:21.188 --> 01:13:22.030
Erik!

01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:24.988
Help me now!
Help me now! He... Ah!

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:38.839
I missed you like crazy.
- My baby.

01:13:38.998 --> 01:13:40.090
I missed you even more.

01:13:42.376 --> 01:13:43.628
Ear-rik.

01:13:45.129 --> 01:13:47.223
Hold on, Ear-rik. I'm on my way!

01:13:53.054 --> 01:13:53.896
Erik?

01:13:54.055 --> 01:13:56.274
Bite, Erik! Bite down hard!

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.608
- Grab it, grab it!
- Use the hips.

01:14:01.771 --> 01:14:03.489
Now spin
around, spin around!

01:14:03.648 --> 01:14:05.116
Almost, almost.

01:14:08.694 --> 01:14:10.537
- There you go.
- Almost got it!

01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:13.957
Papa.

01:14:14.116 --> 01:14:15.789
It's okay, Erik.

01:14:16.243 --> 01:14:18.837
It's okay. I've got you.

01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:22.796
- They're tougher than we think, you know.
- Come on, Erik.

01:14:23.376 --> 01:14:25.470
Let's go get off this thing.

01:14:25.628 --> 01:14:28.006
Carmen! Carmen!

01:14:28.172 --> 01:14:29.594
Where is Carmen?

01:14:29.757 --> 01:14:32.010
Carmen!

01:14:32.385 --> 01:14:37.141
It's okay, Ramon!
I'm fine. I guess.

01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:40.059
I hate these long-distance
relationships!

01:14:41.894 --> 01:14:42.941
Yes?

01:14:43.104 --> 01:14:45.448
You must do me a favor.
I count to three.

01:14:45.606 --> 01:14:47.483
- You push me on two.
- He's gonna jump!

01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:49.493
- But don't tell me, okay?
- Hey, hey.

01:14:49.652 --> 01:14:51.279
- One. Two.
- Ramon, you're crazy!

01:14:51.445 --> 01:14:54.699
Carmen! I'm coming!

01:14:56.826 --> 01:15:00.581
My name is Ramon. Ramon Carlos Garcia
Santa Maria La Niña Pinta Pacifico...

01:15:04.458 --> 01:15:07.007
Ramon.
I can't believe you did this.

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:07.920
How could I not?

01:15:08.087 --> 01:15:10.055
But down here, we're doomed.

01:15:10.214 --> 01:15:14.890
A thousand lifetimes up there is nothing
to this one exquisite moment by your side.

01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:18.814
You are my world entire.

01:15:19.724 --> 01:15:21.943
You're beautiful.

01:15:22.101 --> 01:15:23.478
Only on the outside.

01:15:23.644 --> 01:15:24.896
No!

01:15:25.062 --> 01:15:27.281
Why didn't I see this before?

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:28.737
You're really beautiful.

01:15:28.899 --> 01:15:30.025
You really think so?

01:15:30.192 --> 01:15:31.364
Absolutely.

01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:35.828
Ramon, my fallen angel.
You chased me until I caught you.

01:15:44.749 --> 01:15:46.251
Ay, Ramon, the earth is moving.

01:15:46.417 --> 01:15:47.589
I know. It's amazing.

01:15:47.752 --> 01:15:49.800
No, it's moving for real.
Move! Move!

01:15:51.338 --> 01:15:53.386
Keep going. Don't look back.

01:16:06.854 --> 01:16:08.982
Mumble, that thing's
on the edge!

01:16:09.148 --> 01:16:10.024
Keep trying!

01:16:10.191 --> 01:16:11.738
All it
needs is a nudge!

01:16:11.901 --> 01:16:13.278
We can do this!

01:16:13.444 --> 01:16:14.286
Okay.

01:16:33.756 --> 01:16:35.599
- It's just not enough.
- Not enough.

01:16:35.758 --> 01:16:36.759
Uh, Mumbley.

01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:39.145
- We're not big enough.
- Yeah. My feet hurt.

01:16:39.303 --> 01:16:41.431
- Excuse me. Mumbley. Mumbley.
- Yeah?

01:16:41.806 --> 01:16:43.774
There's a guy named
Lars Gavunsterson.

01:16:43.933 --> 01:16:46.482
I used to dance with his
sister Girta, and I...

01:16:46.685 --> 01:16:49.404
Well, anyway, we were
two-time national champion.

01:16:49.563 --> 01:16:51.611
- Oh. Oh, okay.
- Amateur division, so...

01:16:51.774 --> 01:16:54.072
Um...
Look, could I give it a shot?

01:16:54.485 --> 01:16:56.533
Sure, sure. Of course.

01:16:56.695 --> 01:16:58.789
Attentions! Attentions...

01:16:58.948 --> 01:16:59.870
everybody!

01:17:00.032 --> 01:17:02.205
Mumbley's foot is
very, very hurt-y.

01:17:02.368 --> 01:17:03.415
Yeah,
like your brain.

01:17:03.577 --> 01:17:05.705
But I have
song and dance...

01:17:05.871 --> 01:17:07.214
from my homelands.

01:17:07.373 --> 01:17:10.001
It's in Svenish, so join
in as best you can.

01:17:10.209 --> 01:17:13.839
Okay! And a-nooney, and
a-dooney and a-vooney!

01:17:14.004 --> 01:17:15.096
Get off!

01:17:27.893 --> 01:17:28.610
Come on!

01:17:37.278 --> 01:17:38.655
Help!

01:17:44.743 --> 01:17:46.586
Come on, son. Come on.

01:17:46.745 --> 01:17:47.746
Where are we going?

01:17:47.913 --> 01:17:50.382
To find us a lot more oomph.

01:18:19.445 --> 01:18:20.788
Where am I?

01:18:21.113 --> 01:18:22.956
Who turned out the lights?

01:18:23.616 --> 01:18:25.744
Is this the end?

01:18:26.243 --> 01:18:27.620
I should make out my will.

01:18:27.786 --> 01:18:30.630
I, Willy Williams, leave
everything to my imagination...

01:18:30.789 --> 01:18:34.384
Oh, no. Imagination, it's
the second sign of madness.

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:36.386
If only I'd listened to Bill.

01:18:36.545 --> 01:18:39.469
Oh, Bill. I'm so sorry!

01:18:39.632 --> 01:18:40.804
That's okay, Will.

01:18:40.966 --> 01:18:43.640
You were right.
I should have stayed with the swarm.

01:18:43.802 --> 01:18:45.054
No. You were right.

01:18:45.262 --> 01:18:47.139
Oh, great!
I'm talking to myself.

01:18:47.306 --> 01:18:48.353
You're not mad, Will.

01:18:48.515 --> 01:18:51.644
Now I'm seeing things.
What's going on inside my head?!

01:18:51.810 --> 01:18:53.733
- Will?
- Please, make it stop!

01:18:53.896 --> 01:18:54.772
Will!

01:18:56.357 --> 01:18:57.529
Ow!

01:18:58.150 --> 01:19:00.494
Bill? Is it really you?

01:19:00.653 --> 01:19:03.748
Well, there's only one of me in all the world.
You taught me that.

01:19:03.906 --> 01:19:05.658
Aw, Bill! What are the chances?

01:19:05.824 --> 01:19:07.826
About one in a krillion, Will.

01:19:07.993 --> 01:19:09.711
Quiet, you two.
I'm trying to sleep.

01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:11.668
Hey, everyone! It's Will!

01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:13.047
Wow, it's him!

01:19:13.207 --> 01:19:14.800
It's wee Willy Williams!

01:19:14.959 --> 01:19:16.256
I thought
he'd be taller.

01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:19.046
He's back! Will's back!

01:19:21.674 --> 01:19:22.846
Welcome home, Will.

01:19:23.008 --> 01:19:24.601
But how did you find them?

01:19:24.802 --> 01:19:26.019
They found me.

01:19:26.178 --> 01:19:27.430
I was on my last nine legs.

01:19:27.596 --> 01:19:29.189
I was such a fool, Bill.

01:19:29.348 --> 01:19:30.941
Will, you're a legend.

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:34.274
Those days are gone, my friend.
The carnivore is over.

01:19:34.436 --> 01:19:37.030
No. It's because of
you we're all here.

01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.906
It is?

01:19:38.065 --> 01:19:42.070
I told them how the world really works.
How there were predators, how we had to adapt.

01:19:42.236 --> 01:19:45.365
I led them here, under the great ice.
No one can find us here.

01:19:45.531 --> 01:19:49.377
But we're still at the bottom of the
food chain with no significant purpose.

01:19:49.535 --> 01:19:51.082
Well, we all have a purpose.

01:19:51.245 --> 01:19:53.043
Yours is to change the world.

01:19:53.205 --> 01:19:54.707
What possible difference...

01:19:54.873 --> 01:19:55.965
could one krill make?

01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:59.470
Wait and see, Will.
You wait and see.

01:20:12.391 --> 01:20:14.769
- What are you looking at?
- What are you looking at?

01:20:14.935 --> 01:20:16.562
Don't know, but it sure is ugly.

01:20:16.729 --> 01:20:18.823
Notice, boys, the witty
riposte as weapon?

01:20:18.981 --> 01:20:20.733
Right. Outside, now!

01:20:20.899 --> 01:20:22.242
We are outside.

01:20:22.901 --> 01:20:24.027
- Come on, then.
- No...

01:20:24.194 --> 01:20:26.162
- you come on.
- Excuse me. Bryan?

01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:27.949
Down here.

01:20:28.866 --> 01:20:31.244
Ah, g'day, chief.
What are you doing here?

01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:33.583
Bryan, I need a favor.
A big one.

01:20:33.746 --> 01:20:35.123
For you, champ, anything.

01:20:35.289 --> 01:20:36.916
I need you to come
to Emperor Land.

01:20:37.082 --> 01:20:39.255
Bring as many of your
kind as you can.

01:20:39.418 --> 01:20:40.795
- Why?
- To dance.

01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:42.467
You know...

01:20:43.589 --> 01:20:45.262
Now, why would I wanna do that?

01:20:45.424 --> 01:20:47.301
- To free the penguin nation.
- Oh, yeah?

01:20:47.468 --> 01:20:49.095
- There's been a catastrophe.
- Right.

01:20:49.386 --> 01:20:50.933
The entire population
is trapped.

01:20:51.096 --> 01:20:53.440
Uh-huh.
- By huge walls of ice and snow.

01:20:53.599 --> 01:20:54.600
Hey! Bryan!

01:20:54.767 --> 01:20:58.613
Look, I'd love to help you, sport, but
you've come at the worst possible time.

01:20:58.771 --> 01:21:00.523
Maybe after winter
or something, okay?

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:02.487
No, that's too late.
Way too late.

01:21:02.649 --> 01:21:04.276
Bryan! You gonna fight or what?

01:21:04.443 --> 01:21:06.161
You said you owe me one.

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:08.288
But right now, I got
problems of me own.

01:21:08.447 --> 01:21:12.202
Everyone's cranky, looking for biff.
The multitudes need me to keep the peace.

01:21:12.409 --> 01:21:14.457
If you don't come now,
multitudes will die.

01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:18.420
Here we go. You saying it's my fault now?
Whatever's happening to you penguins...

01:21:18.582 --> 01:21:19.708
don't blame it on me.

01:21:19.917 --> 01:21:21.635
I'm not.
But you can help save them.

01:21:21.794 --> 01:21:25.139
Listen, fella, you look after your
kind, and I'll look after mine.

01:21:25.297 --> 01:21:28.016
If I thought like that, I would
have left you in that hole.

01:21:28.175 --> 01:21:30.598
That's it, I'm claiming a forfeit.
Get off my beach!

01:21:30.761 --> 01:21:32.479
Wayne, now I'm really
gonna hurt you.

01:21:32.638 --> 01:21:33.685
I saved your life!

01:21:33.847 --> 01:21:36.726
And I'm gonna save yours.
Take your furball and fluff off...

01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:38.769
or I'm gonna turn carnivore...

01:21:38.936 --> 01:21:40.483
with a craving for penguin.

01:21:40.646 --> 01:21:42.899
- But...
- The only "butt" I wanna see is yours...

01:21:43.065 --> 01:21:45.033
walking away.

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:53.493
Come on, son.
We're wasting precious time.

01:21:55.327 --> 01:21:57.329
There's nothing for us here.

01:22:04.169 --> 01:22:05.671
Now, where was I?

01:22:05.838 --> 01:22:07.135
- Right here.
- Oh, yeah.

01:22:07.297 --> 01:22:09.174
- What are you looking at?
- What are you?

01:22:09.341 --> 01:22:11.685
I don't know,
but it sure is ugly.

01:22:15.889 --> 01:22:19.359
No, Pa. This is so unfair.

01:22:23.897 --> 01:22:25.615
<i>After all
you have done.</i>

01:22:26.859 --> 01:22:29.988
<i>You really deserve better.</i>

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:36.039
<i>Nothing makes sense
in this world.</i>

01:22:39.538 --> 01:22:42.212
<i>It's all a big pile of crazy.</i>

01:22:49.506 --> 01:22:54.262
<i>And the kings are all fools.</i>

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:55.972
Hm.

01:22:57.431 --> 01:22:59.058
<i>Where is.</i>

01:22:59.224 --> 01:23:03.229
<i>The honor When</i> a.

01:23:03.395 --> 01:23:07.400
<i>Solemn promise.</i>

01:23:07.566 --> 01:23:10.570
<i>Is just</i> a <i>pretty lie?</i>

01:23:11.153 --> 01:23:13.451
<i>And the mighty mock.</i>

01:23:13.614 --> 01:23:16.584
The courage.

01:23:16.742 --> 01:23:22.044
<i>Of the humble?</i>

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:25.926
<i>Although he's just.</i>

01:23:26.084 --> 01:23:30.180
<i>An ordinary penguin.</i>

01:23:31.423 --> 01:23:35.974
<i>My daddy taught me.</i>

01:23:36.553 --> 01:23:37.725
<i>You don't need.</i>

01:23:37.888 --> 01:23:42.109
<i>To be colossal.</i>

01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:45.062
<i>To be a great.</i>

01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:47.778
<i>Heart.</i>

01:23:49.274 --> 01:23:51.072
<i>You don't need.</i>

01:23:51.235 --> 01:23:55.536
<i>To fly.</i>

01:23:55.697 --> 01:23:59.622
<i>To be awesome.</i>

01:24:01.662 --> 01:24:04.290
<i>My hero.</i>

01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:09.302
<i>My father</i>

01:24:34.987 --> 01:24:36.989
<i>Rolling, rolling, rolling.</i>

01:24:37.155 --> 01:24:39.578
<i>Keep moving, moving, moving.</i>

01:24:39.741 --> 01:24:41.664
<i>Keep them doggies moving.</i>

01:24:41.827 --> 01:24:44.171
<i>Rawhide.</i>

01:24:44.329 --> 01:24:49.005
<i>Rain and wind and weather
Hell-bent for leather.</i>

01:24:49.167 --> 01:24:53.513
<i>Wishin' me girl was by me side.</i>

01:24:54.339 --> 01:24:56.262
Oh, my goodness.

01:24:56.425 --> 01:24:57.677
Mumble.

01:24:57.843 --> 01:25:00.847
Hey, I know that guy.
That's Bryan.

01:25:01.263 --> 01:25:02.310
<i>Ride 'em in.</i>

01:25:02.472 --> 01:25:07.478
<i>Rawhide.</i>

01:25:07.686 --> 01:25:09.404
Okay.
This 'berg needs to topple.

01:25:09.855 --> 01:25:13.075
Find yourself an elephant
seal and show them the moves.

01:25:13.233 --> 01:25:16.282
Penguin, how's a bit of fancy
dancing gonna move that?

01:25:16.445 --> 01:25:18.539
With enough oomph, we
can shove enough snow.

01:25:18.697 --> 01:25:20.199
Pack it in behind. It'll go.

01:25:20.365 --> 01:25:22.959
It's not gonna happen.
That's a whopping pile of 'berg!

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:26.630
Just try it. Hit the beat hard!
And together!

01:25:26.788 --> 01:25:28.586
I know how to hit
things hard, okay?

01:25:28.749 --> 01:25:30.251
- And I'm telling you...
- Come on.

01:25:30.417 --> 01:25:33.591
The impact force of compact ice
under pressure is equiv...

01:25:33.754 --> 01:25:36.052
Just give it a go, you big wuss!

01:25:36.214 --> 01:25:37.466
Wayne!

01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:56.243
- Hello.
- Yeah.

01:25:56.401 --> 01:25:57.618
Here we go.

01:25:57.778 --> 01:26:00.406
Now you're talking, Bryan!

01:26:07.704 --> 01:26:09.081
You with me, boys?

01:26:09.247 --> 01:26:11.090
Oh, yeah!

01:26:11.458 --> 01:26:12.459
Pressure.

01:26:12.918 --> 01:26:14.761
<i>Pushing down on me.</i>

01:26:15.087 --> 01:26:16.680
<i>Pressing down on you.</i>

01:26:16.838 --> 01:26:18.511
<i>No man asks for.</i>

01:26:19.299 --> 01:26:20.596
<i>Under pressure.</i>

01:26:21.134 --> 01:26:23.182
<i>That tears a nation down.</i>

01:26:23.345 --> 01:26:25.347
<i>Splits</i> a <i>family in two.</i>

01:26:25.931 --> 01:26:27.774
<i>Puts people on streets.</i>

01:26:28.266 --> 01:26:29.609
<i>People on streets.</i>

01:26:32.521 --> 01:26:33.898
<i>People on streets.</i>

01:26:36.733 --> 01:26:40.454
<i>It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about.</i>

01:26:40.946 --> 01:26:43.040
<i>Watching some good
friends scream.</i>

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:44.241
<i>Let me out.</i>

01:26:45.951 --> 01:26:47.168
<i>Pray tomorrow.</i>

01:26:47.953 --> 01:26:49.626
<i>Take me higher.</i>

01:26:49.996 --> 01:26:51.339
<i>Pray tomorrow.</i>

01:26:52.290 --> 01:26:55.510
<i>Take me higher</i>

01:26:59.506 --> 01:27:02.055
You hear that?
They're doing it again.

01:27:02.259 --> 01:27:04.136
- Doing what?
- This.

01:27:06.138 --> 01:27:08.232
Fascinating. What is it?

01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:10.142
I have no idea.

01:27:10.308 --> 01:27:11.855
Wow! What's it for?

01:27:12.018 --> 01:27:15.443
Perhaps it's a momentary relief from
the existential terrors of existence.

01:27:15.605 --> 01:27:18.905
- Oh. What?
- It brings out my happy.

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:28.497
Oh, yes, indeed!

01:27:30.328 --> 01:27:32.001
Hey, Bryan, what are you doing?

01:27:32.164 --> 01:27:35.839
Sometimes you gotta
back up to go forward.

01:27:36.001 --> 01:27:39.756
<i>Tell me why, tell me why.</i>

01:27:39.921 --> 01:27:43.016
<i>Give ourselves one more chance.</i>

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:47.179
<i>Why can't we give ourselves
One more chance?</i>

01:27:47.345 --> 01:27:51.395
<i>Why can't we give love
Give love, give love.</i>

01:27:51.558 --> 01:27:52.684
<i>Give love.</i>

01:27:53.351 --> 01:27:54.523
<i>Every day.</i>

01:27:54.686 --> 01:27:56.438
<i>Every night, every hour.</i>

01:27:56.605 --> 01:27:58.528
Yeah, come on! Take it higher!

01:27:58.690 --> 01:28:01.819
Come on, come on! Give love, y'all!
Give love, y'all!

01:28:02.736 --> 01:28:04.864
Hey, get down here.

01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:06.532
Yeah.

01:28:06.698 --> 01:28:08.700
- Come on!
- Every step counts.

01:28:08.867 --> 01:28:10.869
<i>To care for.</i>

01:28:11.036 --> 01:28:16.418
<i>The people on The
edge of the night.</i>

01:28:16.583 --> 01:28:19.553
<i>And love dares you.</i>

01:28:19.711 --> 01:28:21.805
<i>To change our way.</i>

01:28:21.963 --> 01:28:23.715
<i>Of caring.</i>

01:28:23.882 --> 01:28:25.805
<i>About ourselves.</i>

01:28:26.009 --> 01:28:28.057
<i>This is.</i>

01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:30.268
<i>Our last dance.</i>

01:28:30.597 --> 01:28:34.568
<i>This is our last dance.</i>

01:28:34.726 --> 01:28:39.232
<i>This is ourselves.</i>

01:28:39.898 --> 01:28:42.868
<i>Creatures of the world unite Strength
in numbers, we can get it right.</i>

01:28:43.235 --> 01:28:44.031
<i>One time.</i>

01:28:44.194 --> 01:28:44.740
Yeah!

01:29:30.824 --> 01:29:33.498
- Be careful, Ramon.
- I'm coming. I'm right behind you.

01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:36.459
Ramon! Amigos!

01:29:37.330 --> 01:29:39.298
I'm getting "emotioable" again.

01:29:39.457 --> 01:29:41.551
- Come on, Ramon.
- Coming, baby!

01:29:41.710 --> 01:29:43.212
- Hi, Erik.
- Hello, Bo.

01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:45.388
Good job, Erik.
You too, Uncle Mumble.

01:29:45.547 --> 01:29:47.049
You really something
special, brother.

01:29:47.215 --> 01:29:49.809
One nation, Mumble.
One nation.

01:29:49.968 --> 01:29:52.847
Irie, walking out now, Mumble.
One nation.

01:29:53.013 --> 01:29:54.014
So, boys...

01:29:54.931 --> 01:29:56.308
- Mommy!
- Gloria.

01:29:56.516 --> 01:29:58.234
Where's my hug?

01:30:01.021 --> 01:30:02.238
Oh, my babies.

01:30:02.397 --> 01:30:04.240
Come on, nippers.
Let's get youse home.

01:30:04.399 --> 01:30:05.821
Hey, Bryan.

01:30:06.192 --> 01:30:07.068
Cheers.

01:30:07.235 --> 01:30:10.489
No worries, penguin. No worries.

01:30:14.326 --> 01:30:15.669
Yeah.

01:30:16.745 --> 01:30:18.497
No worries.

01:39:19.996 --> 01:39:22.545
Ja, the Svend.
