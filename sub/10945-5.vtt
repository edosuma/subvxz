22:11.116 --> 22:15.286
and I just think that it's not the
craziest idea to hire a crew this year.

22:15.353 --> 22:16.587
Jack: Amy...

22:18.556 --> 22:19.991
[Sighs]

22:20.058 --> 22:21.926
I gotta wash up.

22:24.962 --> 22:25.896
<i>Tricia: [Door opens] Hello?</i>

22:25.963 --> 22:27.530
Hello again, tricia.

22:27.598 --> 22:29.499
Tricia: Hey.

22:29.533 --> 22:35.405
You know, I was heading back to
my clinic and I had to turn back.

22:35.472 --> 22:37.007
Something wasn't right
with that guy on the horse.

22:37.074 --> 22:39.575
I know. I know, and when he
heard you were a doctor,

22:39.610 --> 22:41.277
he just... Yeah, I
think he's in denial.

22:41.344 --> 22:44.479
I mean, he knows something's wrong,
but he's too afraid to deal with it.

22:44.547 --> 22:47.349
Well, being in the musical ride,
that's a lot of pressure.

22:47.417 --> 22:52.087
Well, from what he saw, those spasms
could put him and his horse at risk.

22:52.122 --> 22:54.089
You need to convince him
to see someone.

22:54.157 --> 22:56.192
And what if he won't?

22:56.259 --> 22:58.626
It's your call.

22:58.694 --> 23:03.097
But if it were me, I'd make sure he was
pulled from the ride until he did.

23:06.401 --> 23:08.469
Well, look who's here.

23:10.772 --> 23:11.806
[Sucks his teeth]

23:12.741 --> 23:13.807
[Door opens]

23:15.910 --> 23:17.711
Jack: You know, I'm
sorry about that.

23:17.745 --> 23:18.846
Tricia:
Yeah, well, you should be!

23:18.880 --> 23:21.681
Jack: I just got busy and things-
tricia: Oh, you got busy?!

23:21.716 --> 23:23.150
What, I got nothing
but time on my hands?

23:23.218 --> 23:24.351
That's not what I meant.

23:24.385 --> 23:26.453
If you're not interested in taking
care-I am interested in taking care-

23:26.487 --> 23:28.621
oh, yeah, yeah, you got a
funny way of showing it.

23:28.656 --> 23:30.356
Jack:
I have one little heart attack

23:30.423 --> 23:34.360
and everybody thinks they have
to treat me like a sick old man!

23:34.394 --> 23:36.729
Why don't we do this
examination right now?

23:36.796 --> 23:38.497
[Door slams]
I have another appointment.

23:38.531 --> 23:39.631
Tomorrow then.

23:39.666 --> 23:41.200
I'm all booked up, Jack!

23:41.235 --> 23:42.969
Day after tomorrow then.

23:43.003 --> 23:46.338
Look, I'm not driving out here to admire
the scenery, so you better be here

23:46.372 --> 23:48.773
or it's strike three, you're out.

23:48.841 --> 23:52.878
[Truck starts up
and rumbles away]

23:59.986 --> 24:03.053
[Dogs barking]

24:04.856 --> 24:06.357
Ty: Hey, Scott, I
know it's bad timing,

24:06.391 --> 24:09.393
but do you think I could cut out
for a few hours tomorrow?

24:09.427 --> 24:10.694
Scott: Seriously?

24:10.728 --> 24:12.863
With everything
on our plate right now?

24:12.898 --> 24:14.431
I know, it's just...

24:14.465 --> 24:15.766
Jack's bringing in the hay
tomorrow

24:15.800 --> 24:17.934
and he probably shouldn't be
doing it by himself.

24:17.968 --> 24:19.436
No, he shouldn't.

24:20.571 --> 24:23.239
Okay, just get back here
after you're done.

24:23.274 --> 24:25.642
All right, I will. Thank you.

24:27.077 --> 24:30.914
You know, we really could use
another assistant here.

24:30.948 --> 24:33.749
Scott: Well, I saw cassandra
at the dude ranch.

24:33.784 --> 24:35.885
She's working there.

24:35.919 --> 24:37.653
Ty: Yup, I heard.

24:37.687 --> 24:41.390
Pretty tough to get clinic work
after what she pulled here.

24:41.458 --> 24:46.762
Scott: Well, I was thinking, um,
maybe I was too quick to let her go.

24:48.197 --> 24:49.898
You were pretty quick
to let me go.

24:49.932 --> 24:51.433
You didn't seem to have
a problem with that.

24:52.935 --> 24:54.602
[Sighs]

24:54.637 --> 24:56.504
You know I didn't have a choice
in that.

25:00.775 --> 25:03.677
Okay, are you serious?

25:03.711 --> 25:05.947
You're actually thinking about
hiring cassandra back?

25:05.981 --> 25:10.184
Scott: Well, it's not like she was in
on what Jeremy did, and she confessed.

25:14.555 --> 25:17.991
Probably not a good idea, eh?
Forget I brought it up.

25:19.493 --> 25:20.860
[Dogs barking]

25:24.165 --> 25:25.531
Hey, squirt!

25:26.500 --> 25:27.533
Hey.

25:27.601 --> 25:29.368
Hey, sorry I missed
your practice.

25:29.436 --> 25:32.604
It didn't happen.
I was waiting for you.

25:32.672 --> 25:35.341
Yeah, the day just kinda...
Got away from me,

25:35.408 --> 25:37.009
but I'm back now!

25:37.077 --> 25:38.543
<i>Georgie: I don't know why.</i>

25:38.611 --> 25:40.879
I know that you'd rather
hang out with cassandra than me,

25:40.913 --> 25:42.914
so why don't you
just go do that!

25:42.983 --> 25:45.283
Jeff: Wh-Georgie, come on!

25:48.820 --> 25:49.854
Kids, huh?

25:52.391 --> 25:53.424
Hey.

25:54.526 --> 25:55.826
Hey. Hey.

25:57.262 --> 25:58.363
What was that about?

25:58.430 --> 26:01.165
I don't know.
Georgie sounded pretty upset.

26:01.233 --> 26:03.300
She probably had
a good reason.

26:03.368 --> 26:05.736
Yeah. I wasn't expecting
to see you tonight.

26:05.804 --> 26:10.107
Well, I was gonna do some
overtime with Scott, but uh...

26:10.141 --> 26:11.976
He's thinking about hiring
cassandra back.

26:12.043 --> 26:13.410
Are you serious?

26:13.478 --> 26:17.147
Yeah, I mean, we can use the
extra hand at the clinic, Amy -

26:17.215 --> 26:20.583
I'm not arguing that -
but cassandra?

26:22.887 --> 26:24.487
[Birds chirp]

26:25.422 --> 26:26.823
[Door opens]

26:28.025 --> 26:29.158
Lou: Hey, grandpa.

26:29.226 --> 26:30.860
There's eggs on the stove
if you want some.

26:30.928 --> 26:33.429
Jack: I'm not hungry,
but thank you.

26:33.463 --> 26:34.429
What's the matter?

26:34.463 --> 26:35.497
<i>Jack: Aw...</i>

26:35.565 --> 26:36.832
Fuel injector pump
on that tractor,

26:36.900 --> 26:39.868
nobody in town has one.
They have to order it!

26:39.903 --> 26:41.970
So we'll just have
to wait on the hay?

26:42.038 --> 26:43.739
Not if I can help it.

26:43.773 --> 26:47.042
Old Seth fredrickson
owes me a favour.

26:47.076 --> 26:49.277
Great. So he can
bring in the hay.

26:49.311 --> 26:52.013
What do you mean?
I just watch from the sidelines?

26:52.047 --> 26:53.113
You could be the spotter.

26:55.551 --> 26:57.818
You said it was a real job.

26:57.853 --> 27:01.355
Jack: Just make sure everybody's
in the north field at 1 P.M.

27:01.389 --> 27:03.390
Because we are doin' this today!

27:03.425 --> 27:04.725
Lou: Grandpa!

27:04.760 --> 27:06.826
[Door opens and closes]

27:08.930 --> 27:11.264
The fuel injector pump...
Nice one.

27:11.298 --> 27:13.767
It wasn't me this time.

27:14.702 --> 27:15.936
I swear!

27:20.107 --> 27:23.008
Mother: Well, it's about time!

27:23.043 --> 27:24.476
Son: Aw, great.

27:24.510 --> 27:27.813
Get prepared to be lectured
on your lifestyle choices, ma.

27:27.847 --> 27:30.049
I was just pointing out
that the equestrian connection

27:30.083 --> 27:34.053
enforces a weight limit
on our riding program.

27:34.087 --> 27:37.155
What's this?
Where's my extra bacon?!

27:37.190 --> 27:39.023
I substituted
our fresh fruit salad.

27:39.091 --> 27:40.357
Mother: Fruit salad?

27:40.392 --> 27:42.393
You sound like
his uptight wife!

27:42.427 --> 27:44.929
I practically raised my boy
on bacon!

27:44.997 --> 27:47.531
<i>Cassandra: Well, you know what
they say: You are what you eat.</i>

27:49.768 --> 27:51.803
Let me get that
extra bacon for you.

27:53.705 --> 27:55.639
<i>Lou: Excuse us. What do
you think you're doing?</i>

27:55.673 --> 27:58.208
Um, I guess there was
a mix-up in the orders?

27:58.275 --> 28:00.343
It doesn't sound
like a mix-up to me.

28:00.377 --> 28:02.378
I was just trying to help the
guests make healthier choices.

28:02.446 --> 28:03.880
More like giving him
a lecture!

28:03.948 --> 28:05.215
Well, somebody has to!

28:05.282 --> 28:07.818
Yeah, yeah, except that's not
really your job, is it?

28:07.885 --> 28:08.986
Okay, you know what?

28:09.020 --> 28:11.954
Apparently, I can't do
anything right, so I quit!

28:11.989 --> 28:13.388
Wait, sorry, you quit?!

28:13.423 --> 28:14.490
Isn't that a little extreme?

28:14.557 --> 28:15.925
This isn't a good fit for me.

28:15.959 --> 28:18.794
And this isn't a good time
for me to be losing staff, so...

28:18.829 --> 28:20.562
Look, I'm sorry.

28:20.631 --> 28:25.101
Mother: Hello? Order of
bacon - still waiting!

28:27.536 --> 28:30.304
Cassandra: What? You have something
else for me to test drive?!

28:30.372 --> 28:31.840
Jeff: That was a dirty trick.

28:31.874 --> 28:33.441
Cassandra: Why? I brought
it back in one piece.

28:33.509 --> 28:35.243
What more do you want?
It handles nice.

28:35.310 --> 28:36.711
Jeff: Hey, look, I just
want to get to know you!

28:36.779 --> 28:38.246
What is your problem?!

28:38.280 --> 28:40.481
Where to start? Let's see...

28:40.516 --> 28:43.183
Well, I'm obviously not cut out
for the hospitality industry.

28:43.217 --> 28:44.251
What, you got fired?

28:44.318 --> 28:45.519
No, I quit!

28:45.553 --> 28:47.855
And I have no idea
how I'll afford my next term!

28:47.889 --> 28:49.623
I mean, I used to have
a great job at vet clinic

28:49.691 --> 28:53.293
until I made a huge, stupid mistake with
some guy and I'm still paying for it!

28:53.361 --> 28:54.662
Does it have something
to do with Ty?

28:54.729 --> 28:56.030
Uh, yeah.

28:56.097 --> 28:57.730
Mostly the fact
that he can't seem to let it go

28:57.798 --> 29:00.166
and he's making
my life miserable.

29:00.233 --> 29:02.234
Well, hey, if there's anything
I can do to help you out.

29:02.302 --> 29:04.671
Can you just leave me alone?

29:05.806 --> 29:08.875
[Door slams shut,
car starts and rumbles away]

29:13.113 --> 29:15.180
Amy: Brian, what's going on?

29:15.247 --> 29:16.748
[Trailer door
clanks open loudly]

29:16.816 --> 29:18.383
Brian: Look...

29:18.450 --> 29:19.384
Thanks for all your help,
but like I said,

29:19.451 --> 29:21.186
this isn't working!

29:21.253 --> 29:23.588
You know the sergeant is gonna
ask me if you're able to ride.

29:23.656 --> 29:24.690
And what are you gonna say?

29:24.724 --> 29:26.191
I'm gonna say
that you need a medical.

29:26.225 --> 29:27.258
I'll get one after the tour.

29:27.326 --> 29:28.994
No, you need one now.

29:29.062 --> 29:30.828
Look, it could be nothing.

29:30.862 --> 29:33.664
Brian:
No, Amy, it's not nothing.

29:33.699 --> 29:36.734
I, uh, I went to my doctor
a few weeks ago.

29:36.768 --> 29:38.302
And what did your doctor say?

29:41.239 --> 29:43.174
I have multiple sclerosis.

29:44.109 --> 29:46.076
Brian, I had no idea.

29:46.110 --> 29:47.543
Yeah.

29:48.512 --> 29:52.949
My grandma, she's sick,
she's... she's really sick.

29:52.983 --> 29:54.818
This would be her only chance
to see me and now it's over.

29:54.885 --> 29:56.252
This whole thing's over
for me.

29:56.286 --> 29:57.687
<i>Amy: Brian, wait!</i>

29:57.722 --> 30:00.724
Let's just figure
something out, okay?

30:00.758 --> 30:03.525
Give me one more chance.

30:08.118 --> 30:10.318
<i>So we're still missing</i>
<i>a couple of extra hands.</i>

30:10.521 --> 30:13.556
Georgie:
I bet Jeffy would help.

30:13.590 --> 30:15.792
I bet he would.
[Knock at the door]

30:15.826 --> 30:18.328
- Do you mind getting that, honey?
- Yeah, sure.

30:18.362 --> 30:20.996
Okay, so I'll drive and you
throw the bales, right?

30:21.031 --> 30:22.398
Okay, well, what about Jack?

30:22.433 --> 30:23.666
That's the thing.

30:23.701 --> 30:24.967
We need to make him feel
like he's part of it

30:25.035 --> 30:26.601
without actually letting him
do any of the work.

30:26.636 --> 30:27.602
<i>Georgie: [Door
shuts] Come on in.</i>

30:27.637 --> 30:28.903
That's gonna be kinda tough.

30:28.938 --> 30:30.505
Tricia: And demoralizing.

30:30.540 --> 30:34.568
Uh, tricia, we're just trying to make
sure he doesn't hurt himself.

30:34.744 --> 30:36.878
By making him feel useless?

30:36.944 --> 30:39.014
He's completely ignoring his health.

30:39.048 --> 30:40.949
I mean, for your information,
he's not even here,

30:41.016 --> 30:43.351
so he skipped
yet another appointment.

30:43.385 --> 30:45.953
Oh no, I see him tomorrow.
I'm here to work with Amy.

30:45.987 --> 30:48.155
I just came in
to get a cup of coffee.

30:48.189 --> 30:49.256
Oh.

30:49.290 --> 30:50.558
Ty: Well, let me
get that for you.

30:50.625 --> 30:52.159
Tricia: Thanks.

30:54.128 --> 30:57.964
You know, I think I see why Jack's having
a hard time accepting his condition.

30:59.400 --> 31:03.302
I know you're all concerned for him,
but you need to stop putting limits

31:03.337 --> 31:04.471
on what he can do.

31:04.505 --> 31:08.007
He's still a strong,
energetic, virile man.

31:08.075 --> 31:09.409
Virile?

31:09.443 --> 31:12.178
<i>Georgie: What's virile?</i>

31:12.246 --> 31:15.947
I'm just saying
he's still very capable.

31:16.015 --> 31:19.385
It's one thing to be careful, but
maybe it's time for you guys

31:19.452 --> 31:22.053
to take off the kid gloves.

31:22.121 --> 31:23.188
Thanks.

31:27.193 --> 31:28.293
So I got you
these little blunt spurs.

31:28.361 --> 31:31.061
So if your legs start shaking you're
not gonna be jabbing him in his side.

31:31.096 --> 31:32.697
Brian:
You know I can't control that.

31:32.731 --> 31:35.500
Amy: I know, but we can minimize
the effect it has on the horse.

31:35.534 --> 31:40.537
And... I installed some padding on
the bottom of your saddle, okay?

31:40.605 --> 31:43.374
And we can put some in your
boots too during the ride.

31:43.441 --> 31:47.144
If your arms start spasming, best thing
to do is to put slack in your reigns

31:47.212 --> 31:50.214
and grab onto this
leather strap, okay?

31:50.248 --> 31:52.549
Now, you just look where you want
to go and Cole will take you there.

31:52.617 --> 31:54.150
What if he doesn't?

31:54.184 --> 31:55.752
You're just gonna have
to trust him.

31:55.820 --> 31:59.489
He knows his job,
you just let him do it.

31:59.557 --> 32:01.892
What's she doing here?

32:02.860 --> 32:05.228
