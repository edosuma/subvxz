She went this way!

01:22.599 --> 01:25.968
I heard somethin' over here.
Don't let her get away.

01:25.970 --> 01:29.005
There's nowhere to run.

01:33.944 --> 01:36.914
You made that a lot harder
than it needed to be.

01:42.753 --> 01:44.353
Taz!

01:54.032 --> 01:56.033
Don't you move!
Aah!

02:18.455 --> 02:22.493
I'm gonna enjoy
putting you down, traitor.

02:44.015 --> 02:45.849
<i>Yo, I'm Angelino,</i>

02:45.851 --> 02:49.484
<i>and our story takes place in a
shithole called Dark Meat City.</i>

02:49.486 --> 02:51.889
<i>I was born here.
Probably die here too.</i>

02:53.591 --> 02:55.859
<i>DMC.</i>

02:55.861 --> 02:59.461
<i>As in depression, murder,
and crazy-ass motherfuckers.</i>

02:59.463 --> 03:00.864
Break it up!

03:00.866 --> 03:03.866
<i>I'm 22, and I'm
a pizza delivery guy, I guess.</i>

03:03.868 --> 03:05.869
<i>I get paid, and I get
the fuck out of there.</i>

03:05.871 --> 03:07.871
<i>Don't ask questions.
Don't get involved.</i>

03:07.873 --> 03:09.873
<i>Just complicates things, y'know?</i>

03:09.875 --> 03:12.108
<i>Already ugly as fuck. I don't
need no more complications.</i>

03:17.849 --> 03:19.649
<i>When it comes to
the school of hard knocks,</i>

03:19.651 --> 03:20.850
<i>I probably ain't
never gonna graduate.</i>

03:20.852 --> 03:22.452
<i>But I ain't complaining.</i>

03:22.454 --> 03:24.453
<i>So many others
just drop out.</i>

03:24.455 --> 03:26.622
What's up, Mac? Come on!

03:26.624 --> 03:27.957
Man, move your hobo asses!

03:27.959 --> 03:29.558
What did I tell you?

03:29.560 --> 03:31.728
<i>Did I mention
I hate this place?</i>

03:31.730 --> 03:34.030
<i>It's like everyone's
tryin' to take you out.</i>

03:34.032 --> 03:35.498
Aah! Shit!

03:35.500 --> 03:37.934
Stupid ass bird.
Watch where you flying.

03:37.936 --> 03:44.110
<i>How was I supposed to know that one
little look would change everything?</i>

03:59.591 --> 04:02.725
<i>They say real love stories don't
end up like they do in the movies.</i>

04:02.727 --> 04:04.994
<i>But how would I know?</i>

04:04.996 --> 04:06.866
<i>I ain't never been in love.</i>

04:12.871 --> 04:15.939
<i>I ain't never kept a job
longer than three weeks.</i>

04:15.941 --> 04:17.942
<i>'Cause I'm "lucky" like that.</i>

04:17.944 --> 04:23.080
<i>But I gotta pay rent somehow,
and I can't count on Vinz.</i>

04:23.082 --> 04:26.849
<i>No one'll hire him 'cause he's
a fire hazard or some shit.</i>

04:26.851 --> 04:28.918
<i>We're fucked.</i>

04:28.920 --> 04:31.956
<i>Just keep your head down,
mouth shut.</i>

04:31.958 --> 04:35.893
<i>You even think about
disrespecting these motherfuckers,</i>

04:35.895 --> 04:37.827
<i>and you're done.</i>

04:37.829 --> 04:41.164
<i>The rule is: Don't cause
no trouble for nobody,</i>

04:41.166 --> 04:42.866
<i>and maybe they'll do the same.</i>

04:42.868 --> 04:45.002
<i>Yeah, I get it.
I'm a joke.</i>

04:45.004 --> 04:47.237
<i>But right now,
I just wanna get home.</i>

04:47.239 --> 04:49.940
Hey! Put your head
in a bag, <i>ese!</i>

04:49.942 --> 04:51.741
Cover that shit up,
Holmes!

04:51.743 --> 04:54.046
<i>Alive, if possible.</i>

04:56.015 --> 04:57.681
<i>Hotel Guadalupe.</i>

04:57.683 --> 05:00.751
<i>It's like purgatory
but with cable.</i>

05:00.753 --> 05:02.721
<i>Lived here four years.</i>

05:05.024 --> 05:07.192
<i>Straight from the mouth of
hell, Lucifer's favorite son...</i>

05:07.194 --> 05:08.625
- Yo, Vinz?
- Wassup?

05:08.627 --> 05:11.061
What's with all this
shit on the floor?

05:11.063 --> 05:14.264
For real,
can you just clean up after yourself?

05:14.266 --> 05:17.034
Whoa. What the fuck
happened to your face, bro?

05:17.036 --> 05:19.937
Got hit by some big-ass truck,
came outta nowhere.

05:19.939 --> 05:22.573
Man, people need to learn
how to drive in this town.

05:22.575 --> 05:24.041
Oh, yeah,
and I got fired.

05:24.043 --> 05:26.010
- Again?
- Yup.

05:26.012 --> 05:27.344
Hey, you feed
the roaches yet?

05:27.346 --> 05:29.113
Why can't they just eat
what's on the floor?

05:29.115 --> 05:31.049
Nah, the floor's nasty.

05:31.051 --> 05:33.953
Roaches have sensitive tummies.
I read that somewhere.

05:35.188 --> 05:38.255
Real talk though?
I don't know how we're gonna do this.

05:38.257 --> 05:41.191
Rent's two months late,
we ain't got no jobs.

05:41.193 --> 05:44.863
Dude, I know <i>Lucha Ãšltima's</i> on,
but we gotta figure shit out.

05:44.865 --> 05:46.697
You think we should
talk to Willy?

05:46.699 --> 05:48.632
Can we please leave Willy
out of this? He's weird.

05:48.634 --> 05:52.069
Okay, come to Papa.

05:52.071 --> 05:55.273
Ah! There ya go.
Daddy's got a little treat for you.

05:55.275 --> 05:57.976
Oh, you brought some friends too.
That's cool.

05:57.978 --> 06:00.646
Eww! That's gross, man.

06:01.647 --> 06:03.849
And you're eating
the pet food?

06:06.686 --> 06:09.054
The roaches
freak me out, man.

06:09.056 --> 06:11.655
- Are you even listening to me?
- Yeah.

06:11.657 --> 06:14.025
I mean, they're just taking over
the whole crib, bro.

06:14.027 --> 06:17.662
I know this is a shit apartment,
but can we at least have some standards?

06:17.664 --> 06:19.264
<i>Right to the jaw!</i>

06:19.266 --> 06:22.300
Hey, Vinz.
You know what'd really suck?

06:22.302 --> 06:25.072
If even the roaches
get out of here before we do.

08:00.034 --> 08:03.935
Hey! I think you're in the wrong
neighborhood, <i>marica.</i>

08:03.937 --> 08:06.339
<i>The terrorist attacks on the White House</i>

08:06.341 --> 08:09.074
- <i>aren't just a threat to us on Pennsylvania Avenue,</i>
- Shit. My head.

08:09.076 --> 08:11.277
<i>but to our entire nation
and the American way of life.</i>

08:11.279 --> 08:13.245
Lino, you look rough, bro.
You okay?

08:13.247 --> 08:15.514
Couldn't sleep.
Kept having messed-up dreams.

08:15.516 --> 08:18.051
Think that accident really
fucked up my head, man.

08:18.053 --> 08:20.085
Bro, I think we should
go get that checked out.

08:20.087 --> 08:22.922
You could drop dead or something.
Let's go see a doctor today.

08:22.924 --> 08:24.390
No way. No doctors.

08:24.392 --> 08:26.926
They just make you
pay for bad news.

08:31.333 --> 08:34.236
Oh, no. It's Willy.

08:40.073 --> 08:41.408
Shit, man.

08:41.409 --> 08:42.976
Open up, jerkwads!

08:42.977 --> 08:46.313
It's me! Willy!

08:46.315 --> 08:48.981
Come on.
I know you're home. I hear the TV.

08:48.983 --> 08:50.517
It's not like
you can go anywhere.

08:50.519 --> 08:52.785
You're a couple of broke
a-holes with no car.

08:52.787 --> 08:54.788
- Vinz, I can see the flame on your head!
- Damn.

08:54.790 --> 08:56.923
Come on! Open up! Hey-oh!

08:56.925 --> 08:59.326
Man, I can't handle
that clown right now.

09:02.930 --> 09:05.365
Um...

09:05.367 --> 09:07.300
Shut the fuck up.

09:07.302 --> 09:10.370
Your goddamn noise
is pissing off my snake.

09:12.474 --> 09:16.008
Oh, man. Now I have to let Willy
in, or the Nazi is gonna kill him.

09:16.010 --> 09:18.845
I mean,
would that be the worst thing?

09:18.847 --> 09:20.880
Ah! Took you long enough!

09:20.882 --> 09:23.817
What are you doin' in here?
Smellin' each other's balls or somethin'?

09:23.819 --> 09:26.952
Willy, please keep it down.
My head's gonna burst.

09:26.954 --> 09:30.291
Seriously, what's with your neighbor?
It's a free country.

09:30.293 --> 09:33.827
Our founding fathers died for
my right to yell in hallways.

09:33.829 --> 09:36.263
I mean, back me up, Lino.
Am I right or am I right?

09:36.265 --> 09:38.331
Whatever. Sure, man.
Just shut the fuck up, dude.

09:38.333 --> 09:40.533
Huh? This guy again?

09:40.535 --> 09:43.571
<i>...until they themselves know
the terror they tried...</i>

09:43.573 --> 09:45.839
Terrorism,
blah, blah, blah.

09:45.841 --> 09:47.575
So where are these
alleged terrorists, huh?

09:47.577 --> 09:50.844
Playing poker with the tooth
fairy and my imaginary girlfriend?

09:50.846 --> 09:52.946
Ha! I mean, look at
that guy right there!

09:52.948 --> 09:56.450
Showing a face like that on TV,
that's terrorism!

09:56.452 --> 09:59.620
Ooh, what a sick burn!

10:10.233 --> 10:12.500
What the hell?
Did you not just see that?

10:12.502 --> 10:15.001
Those savages
ran off with my hot dog!

10:15.003 --> 10:16.569
You're not gonna do
anything?

10:16.571 --> 10:19.307
You know those things carry
a nut-ton of diseases, right?

10:19.309 --> 10:20.842
Why are you here?

10:21.877 --> 10:24.478
Uh, I don't know.
I missed you douchebags.

10:24.480 --> 10:27.280
I wanted to go out,
get some froyo or somethin'.

10:27.282 --> 10:32.420
Come on, let's get some air, 'cause, honestly,
Lino over here looks like a shit took a shit.

10:32.422 --> 10:35.356
Everybody knows it's staged, Willy.
Diablo always wins.

10:35.358 --> 10:37.625
I could put on tights, go into a
ring, and do the same exact shit.

10:37.627 --> 10:39.427
- What?
- I'm serious.

10:39.429 --> 10:42.029
Except you've got the bone
structure of a little bitch.

10:42.031 --> 10:45.068
Oh, yeah? Grr!

10:46.602 --> 10:49.969
<i>I fucking hate the bus.</i>

10:49.971 --> 10:55.076
<i>But I read people get shot more
walking, so my ass takes the bus.</i>

10:55.078 --> 10:58.512
<i>Don't get it twisted.
DMC's worse than it sounds.</i>

10:58.514 --> 11:01.048
<i>And it will eat you alive.</i>

11:01.050 --> 11:02.984
<i>Only question is when.</i>

11:04.086 --> 11:06.621
<i>Me and Vinz talk about
escaping one day.</i>

11:06.623 --> 11:10.424
<i>But we ain't foolin' nobody.
Got no car or money.</i>

11:10.426 --> 11:13.427
<i>Just the roaches
and this motherfucking bus.</i>

11:13.429 --> 11:15.396
<i>No, for real.</i>

11:15.398 --> 11:20.435
<i>Like the rest of these poor fuckers...
no dreams, no hope, no future.</i>

11:20.437 --> 11:22.506
<i>Ain't got a shadow
of a prayer.</i>

11:31.548 --> 11:34.585
Lino, what you think?
Could Vinz be a wrestler?

11:37.253 --> 11:39.019
Hello!
Is Vinz a bitch or not?

11:39.021 --> 11:41.256
Huh? Oh, uh, I guess.

11:41.258 --> 11:43.991
I just... Did you guys see the
priest walking by with the...

11:43.993 --> 11:46.663
Uh, never mind.

11:48.965 --> 11:51.666
Oh, finally!
I can breathe again!

11:51.668 --> 11:54.169
So where you guys
think we should eat?

11:54.171 --> 11:56.171
Don't forget,
you jerks owe me a hotdog.

11:58.542 --> 12:02.377
Did you know Diablo can eat
a whole bowl of hot dogs in three minutes?

12:02.379 --> 12:05.112
- No, he can't. What are you...
- He does!

12:05.114 --> 12:07.115
I watched a behind-the-scenes
thing about it!

12:07.117 --> 12:09.084
And again,
I'm tellin' you, that's all theater.

12:09.086 --> 12:10.254
It's fuckin' fake.

12:11.221 --> 12:13.089
- What do you think, Lino?
- What the hell?

12:15.091 --> 12:18.162
You gotta take better care of
yourself, man. Let's go get some food.

12:23.033 --> 12:25.200
<i>Maybe Vinz is right.</i>

12:25.202 --> 12:28.135
<i>That truck must've fucked
me up worse than I thought.</i>

12:28.137 --> 12:32.541
<i>Probably cracked my skull and now my brain's
gonna leak out all over my sneakers.</i>

12:32.543 --> 12:37.314
<i>Or it's some bacteria-ass shit that makes
you go crazy and kills you two weeks later.</i>

12:40.049 --> 12:42.050
Bro, are you okay?

12:42.052 --> 12:44.689
For real, man. You seem pretty out of it.
You wanna go home and chill?

12:45.623 --> 12:47.589
I don't know.

12:47.591 --> 12:49.658
I'm suddenly seein' all this trippy
shit and it's freakin' me out.

12:49.660 --> 12:51.660
Like, look!
That dude over there.

12:51.662 --> 12:54.699
You don't see anything weird?
Look at him!

12:59.169 --> 13:01.236
Remind me what I'm lookin' at.

13:01.238 --> 13:02.606
You didn't see his shadow?

13:04.141 --> 13:06.576
With crazy tentacles and
shit coming out of his head?

13:06.578 --> 13:07.679
Huh?

13:14.151 --> 13:16.451
- What? I'm not crazy, dude!
- Yeah, Lino, sure you're not.

13:16.453 --> 13:18.554
Fuck, what's wrong with me?

13:18.556 --> 13:21.557
I think the sun's frying your brain.
It's too hot outside. Let's go.

13:21.559 --> 13:24.059
Yeah, maybe. Let's find a
place to hang out and chill.

13:24.061 --> 13:28.196
- So, Pipo's then?
- Oh, again? But I want froyo!

13:33.304 --> 13:35.605
<i>The mercury has hit
another record high today,</i>

13:35.607 --> 13:38.106
<i>with daytime temperatures soaring
well above the seasonal norm</i>

13:38.108 --> 13:39.609
<i>for the third week in a row.</i>

13:39.611 --> 13:41.544
<i>It's recommended that
elderly viewers and children...</i>

13:41.546 --> 13:44.413
Wrong. It's those chem-trails in
the sky that's making it so hot!

13:44.415 --> 13:49.119
The government's ruining our climate so that
we buy more American-made cars and soda.

14:00.164 --> 14:02.865
...fancy dinner where we what?
Yeah. Buy more soda!

14:02.867 --> 14:05.101
Lino.

14:05.103 --> 14:07.470
I'm telling you man,
the sugar and car lobbies run our country!

14:07.472 --> 14:11.476
What? Damn. Now see,
I would let her lobby at me all day.

14:15.647 --> 14:18.415
She's looking at us.

14:18.417 --> 14:21.520
Ooh, Lino,
she's checking you out, brother.

14:24.489 --> 14:25.889
<i>SeÃ±orita.</i>

14:25.891 --> 14:28.257
Yeah, uh,
let's get out of here.

14:28.259 --> 14:30.761
What are you doing?
Why are we running?

14:30.763 --> 14:34.198
Wait up!
We didn't pay for the food!

14:37.135 --> 14:39.735
<i>Gracias, pero,</i>
this is too much.

14:39.737 --> 14:42.107
It's cool.
Keep the change!

14:49.582 --> 14:52.548
I don't know about you,
but I got that "itis."

14:52.550 --> 14:54.785
Make sure you stay
downwind from me.

14:54.787 --> 14:57.621
Plus, I get gas.
It's genetic.

14:57.623 --> 15:01.357
Genetic? It's not genetic,
Willy, you're just disgusting.

15:01.359 --> 15:02.693
Don't judge me, man.

15:02.695 --> 15:05.362
Hey, guys,
I think someone's tailing us.

15:05.364 --> 15:09.232
See that one over there pretending
to talk on the phone that don't work?

15:09.234 --> 15:13.470
- Huh? Wait. Where?
- Yo, be more discreet, dumb-ass!

15:13.472 --> 15:15.371
- You mean, wing tips?
- Yeah.

15:15.373 --> 15:18.243
The three of them been
following us for a while now.

15:37.930 --> 15:40.731
Now I feel stupid.
They weren't after us, man.

15:40.733 --> 15:42.500
What the hell is up
with you today?

15:42.502 --> 15:44.738
You've been acting crazy
since this morning.

15:50.342 --> 15:52.344
Still think I'm paranoid?

15:54.881 --> 15:57.949
Uh, why don't we just
ask 'em what they want?

15:57.951 --> 16:02.552
Nah, man. I'm not askin' those <i>Men
in Black</i> motherfuckers nothing.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.795
What are we
supposed to do, Lino?

16:10.463 --> 16:12.462
We go into ninja mode.

16:12.464 --> 16:15.632
We turn the corner, and as soon
as we outta their sight, we out.

16:18.438 --> 16:19.606
Ninja!

16:21.608 --> 16:23.975
We've been made!

16:23.977 --> 16:25.745
Don't let him get away!

16:30.850 --> 16:32.285
What do they want?

16:35.555 --> 16:38.556
I'm slowin' down!

16:38.558 --> 16:40.827
I...

16:57.410 --> 16:58.876
Stop or I'll shoot!

16:58.878 --> 17:01.312
Oh, shit, he's got a gun.
He's got a gun! Gun, gun.

17:01.314 --> 17:02.749
Wait? What?

17:30.044 --> 17:32.044
Go! Get the fuck outta here!

17:32.046 --> 17:33.748
I got you, bro.

17:35.348 --> 17:36.917
This fuckin' brick!

17:46.894 --> 17:48.495
I got you, Lino.

18:04.477 --> 18:06.514
We need to get outta here
right now. Let's go!

18:11.886 --> 18:13.786
Did you grab his gun, dude?

18:13.788 --> 18:17.525
Why the fuck would I do that?
It's not GTA. Let's go.

18:21.362 --> 18:23.629
What do you think those
dudes wanted from us, man?

18:23.631 --> 18:27.633
To kill us, obviously.
The whole damn city's nuts.

18:27.635 --> 18:30.469
What could they want?
Dude, did you see their clothes?

18:30.471 --> 18:32.404
They're not from here,
are they?

18:32.406 --> 18:34.073
For real,
they weren't dressed like dealers, bro.

18:34.075 --> 18:35.908
Looked like hitmen to me.

18:35.910 --> 18:38.477
Hopefully, they're
looking for someone else.

18:38.479 --> 18:42.649
You mean some other ugly bug-eyed
dude and a guy with his head on fire?

18:42.651 --> 18:44.483
- Maybe they're CIA.
- Yeah, right!

18:44.485 --> 18:46.953
They wanted to know where we
were when Kennedy got shot.

18:46.955 --> 18:49.755
Ba-bang!
Too soon?

18:49.757 --> 18:52.524
- Whoa! A shooting star! You see that?
- No? Where?

18:52.526 --> 18:54.894
Uh, in the sky.
Where else, dumb-ass?

18:54.896 --> 18:57.163
Fuck you, Willy.
I just didn't see it. The sky's big.

18:57.165 --> 19:00.066
- "Wah, my head's on fire, and the sky's too big!"
- Fuckin' rude. Why...

19:00.068 --> 19:02.668
Hey! I saw one that time!
Look, there's another one!

19:02.670 --> 19:04.703
Make a wish.
Make a wish right now.

19:04.705 --> 19:06.773
What would you wish for,
Lino?

19:06.775 --> 19:08.608
M-Me?

19:08.610 --> 19:10.509
I don't know.

19:10.511 --> 19:13.480
I just wanna be... a somebody.

19:19.988 --> 19:23.992
<i>That Diablo sure knows
how to please a crowd. Oh, what's this?</i>

19:25.961 --> 19:27.461
<i>10-4. In sight.</i>

19:39.007 --> 19:41.041
<i>Three on the roof.</i>

19:41.043 --> 19:44.677
- <i>Sun God slam! The crowd is going nuts!</i>
- <i>Still our suspect.</i>

19:44.679 --> 19:47.947
Fuck, man. What the fuck is wrong
with this janky-ass piece of shit?

19:47.949 --> 19:49.618
Picking up the whole city.

19:56.791 --> 19:58.524
- Do you hear that?
- <i>Go.</i>

19:58.526 --> 20:01.429
W-W-Wait, stop that. Stop that.
Is that police chatter?

20:02.931 --> 20:05.935
<i>Operation
Blackball is a go! Move, move, move!</i>

20:07.469 --> 20:10.006
What the hell is
Operation Blackball?

20:23.219 --> 20:24.586
Huh?

20:36.232 --> 20:39.565
For the last fucking time,
if you don't...

20:39.567 --> 20:40.970
Contact in ten seconds.

20:43.039 --> 20:44.772
I don't know
what's going on outside,

20:44.774 --> 20:47.043
but whatever it is,
it's kind of weird.

20:48.844 --> 20:51.245
- What the fu...
- Contact!

21:00.056 --> 21:02.990
Vinz, man, what the fuck
are you doing?

21:02.992 --> 21:04.995
Get your ass
over here and help!

21:21.844 --> 21:23.112
<i>Status?</i>

21:24.313 --> 21:26.449
<i>What's your
status report?</i>

22:16.900 --> 22:19.970
This is my shithole!
Get the fuck out!

22:26.243 --> 22:28.178
Did you just kill a cop?

22:40.690 --> 22:44.295
- Oh, they're gonna kill us. They're gonna kill us.
- Not yet.

23:06.683 --> 23:07.985
Grenade. Grenade!

23:17.028 --> 23:20.064
Lino, come on.
Come on, we have to go!

23:37.181 --> 23:38.382
Ha!

23:49.893 --> 23:51.695
Huh?

24:02.173 --> 24:03.907
Yo, this way, dumb-ass.

24:10.848 --> 24:12.884
How is he doing that?

24:24.128 --> 24:26.197
Psst. Hey, Lino.
Down here. Hurry.

24:29.034 --> 24:32.035
Whoa, man. I'm not saying this
'cause we're in the sewer,

24:32.037 --> 24:34.071
but I think you might be
a Ninja Turtle, Lino.

24:39.143 --> 24:40.977
Shit.

24:40.979 --> 24:43.415
You gonna tell me
you killed them?

24:44.782 --> 24:49.153
Two idiot kids took out
an entire elite squad?

24:50.154 --> 24:52.154
The abomination did this.

24:52.156 --> 24:55.158
I knew that little bastard's
power wouldn't stay dormant.

24:55.160 --> 24:58.028
And you assholes
let him get away.

24:58.030 --> 25:03.301
The kid's a ticking time bomb that needs
to be extinguished before it explodes.

25:05.103 --> 25:09.141
<i>Â¿Un suplex, en serio?
Â¡Esas son mamadas!</i>

25:17.883 --> 25:22.888
Getting harder to work with El Diablo
in the ring. He's keeps goin' off-book.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.555
Guy has, like, no boundaries.

25:25.557 --> 25:28.392
Oh, come on. What?
You gonna cry about it?

25:28.394 --> 25:30.328
He's El-freakin'-Diablo.

25:30.330 --> 25:33.163
He may bust our balls,
but he's giving the crowd what they want.

25:33.165 --> 25:37.069
Look, see?
Tell me that's not a sign.

25:38.170 --> 25:41.172
Mmm?
Looks kinda like a cockroach.

25:41.174 --> 25:43.241
Again with your damn signs.

25:43.243 --> 25:44.575
Bullshit.

25:44.577 --> 25:46.477
Now it's a roach
on your towel.

25:46.479 --> 25:49.045
Last week you saw the Virgin
Guadalupe in your rearview,

25:49.047 --> 25:51.081
and then some stupid face
on fire...

25:51.083 --> 25:54.185
A flaming skull on my BLT.
In Aguascalientes.

25:54.187 --> 25:58.855
Because the universe always writes its
most important messages on sandwiches?

25:58.857 --> 26:03.193
I think you're just seeing what you
wanna see, reading into things too much.

26:03.195 --> 26:07.064
I'm just saying, stop looking
for meaning when there isn't any.

26:07.066 --> 26:10.201
You're gonna drive yourself
totally nuts with that shit!

26:10.203 --> 26:12.902
You just can't accept the fact
that we're Guardians,

26:12.904 --> 26:15.071
and as Guardians
it's our job to stay vigilant

26:15.073 --> 26:17.208
for whatever the universe
throws our way! We...

26:17.210 --> 26:19.210
He's right.

26:19.212 --> 26:22.213
It was only by deciphering
signs and omens

26:22.215 --> 26:25.982
that the ancients before us could
fulfill their true destinies.

26:25.984 --> 26:30.054
Every generation of Guardians
exists to fight a specific battle.

26:30.056 --> 26:32.089
Don't worry.
We'll get tagged in.

26:32.091 --> 26:34.924
And then our purpose
will be revealed to us.

26:34.926 --> 26:36.028
Hell, yeah!

26:37.095 --> 26:40.130
Yeah, but, like,
a cockroach?

26:40.132 --> 26:42.333
Can the universe
be clearer?

26:42.335 --> 26:45.303
Our job is to be patient
and lie in wait.

26:45.305 --> 26:48.241
And when the world finally needs
us, we'll know it.

26:53.647 --> 26:59.116
<i>The</i> Lucha Ãšltima <i>fighters are
descended from the Eagle and Jaguar tribes,</i>

26:59.118 --> 27:02.386
<i>the most elite warriors
of the Aztec empire,</i>

27:02.388 --> 27:07.426
<i>masters of the MÃ­stica, the art of
unraveling the mysteries of destiny.</i>

27:07.428 --> 27:10.995
<i>Generations of guardians
have waged wars in the shadows,</i>

27:10.997 --> 27:14.632
<i>keeping us safe from evil
since time immemorial.</i>

27:14.634 --> 27:18.102
<i>But today's</i> luchadors
<i>have no such battles.</i>

27:18.104 --> 27:20.971
<i>Yet they stay in shape
with intense training,</i>

27:20.973 --> 27:24.375
<i>donning tights and fighting each other
in spectacular choreographed shows</i>

27:24.377 --> 27:28.114
<i>to pay the rent and stave off
existential boredom.</i>

27:46.667 --> 27:48.502
Stop being difficult.

27:53.073 --> 27:54.541
<i>Mama.</i>

28:01.648 --> 28:06.153
We'll find him either way.
So, where is he?

28:15.194 --> 28:18.698
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
please protect my precious boy.

28:18.700 --> 28:21.435
I assure you,
we'll find him.

28:33.715 --> 28:38.016
This is your last chance.
Where is he?

28:38.018 --> 28:39.952
I only have one request.

28:42.424 --> 28:44.958
Please don't shoot me
in the head.

28:48.028 --> 28:50.030
Hmm.

28:55.770 --> 28:59.674
<i>She knew what she was doing.
The bitch was playin' us.</i>

29:01.308 --> 29:02.674
<i>Ah.</i>

29:02.676 --> 29:05.213
<i>The kid's long gone by now.</i>

29:19.360 --> 29:21.294
My last quarter.

29:21.296 --> 29:23.665
This shit better not go to
voicemail, or we fucked, man.

29:36.778 --> 29:39.313
Not now!

29:40.113 --> 29:42.183
My ass is gonna explode.

29:44.152 --> 29:45.551
- What?
- <i>Hey, Willy. Is that you?</i>

29:45.553 --> 29:48.221
Oh, hey, my dude.
How's life on the run?

29:48.223 --> 29:50.790
<i>You need to find us another spot, man.
We can't hide out here.</i>

29:50.792 --> 29:53.092
We shouldn't be talking
about this on my home line.

29:53.094 --> 29:55.328
The phones are probably tapped!
It's called surveillance, dumb-ass!

29:55.330 --> 29:58.397
<i>I know, I know, but this place is way too
hood, man. Like, I'm cool, but Vinz is...</i>

29:58.399 --> 30:00.233
Oh, my apologies!

30:00.235 --> 30:02.268
Caesar's freakin' Palace was all full up!

30:02.270 --> 30:04.338
<i>But, hey, why don't I just call
my buddy at the Ritz for ya?</i>

30:04.340 --> 30:06.573
What's with the beeping?
Stop pushin' buttons, dude.

30:06.575 --> 30:09.509
<i>I wonder if I can Google "hotels that
cater specifically to cop-killers."</i>

30:09.511 --> 30:11.377
Yeah, we fucked up,
and we totally owe you one.

30:11.379 --> 30:14.280
But can you just hook us up one last time?
Like, a plan "B"?

30:14.282 --> 30:16.583
<i>Or like a relative we could
stay with or somethin'?</i>

30:16.585 --> 30:18.452
What am I,
your travel agent?

30:18.454 --> 30:20.419
That's all I got, guys!

30:20.421 --> 30:22.588
And you two better not come back
here, because the CIA!

30:22.590 --> 30:25.358
And also, I'm dealing with an
emergency situation right now.

30:25.360 --> 30:26.659
<i>Willy, we're not
playin' around, man.</i>

30:26.661 --> 30:28.462
<i>We're in some real deep shit
right now.</i>

30:28.464 --> 30:30.831
He hung up on me.

30:30.833 --> 30:33.702
Oh, I see how it is.
Fine, guys. Be that way.

30:42.578 --> 30:44.678
I don't think
we should stay here, Lino.

30:44.680 --> 30:46.880
Look how much we stand out.
I'm half-naked.

30:46.882 --> 30:49.382
Sorry. I know you
liked that shirt.

30:49.384 --> 30:51.384
But we couldn't risk them
seeing you in green.

30:51.386 --> 30:54.421
- Yeah, I know.
- Hey, but look on the bright side.

30:54.423 --> 30:57.858
The cops ain't gonna find us, 'cause
they won't set foot in this part of town.

30:57.860 --> 30:59.726
Even they're not
that crazy.

30:59.728 --> 31:02.228
That makes me feel so
much better about our situation.

31:02.230 --> 31:05.732
We just gotta keep our
heads down, don't disrespect nobody.

31:05.734 --> 31:10.537
Just keep walking
and hope you don't die.

31:10.539 --> 31:13.241
Same ground rules
as back home, right?

31:24.820 --> 31:27.153
Yo. What's good, Cuz?

31:27.155 --> 31:30.157
This ain't no place for no
little motherfuckers like you.

31:30.159 --> 31:33.627
"Give thy thoughts no tongue,
nor any unproportioned thought his act."

31:33.629 --> 31:36.396
- That's Shakespeare.
- Yeah, that's right.

31:36.398 --> 31:39.333
Oh, see, this guy Willy
is our friend, and, uh...

31:39.335 --> 31:43.805
Well, it's kinda complicated, but...
I mean, we come from Dark Meat City,

31:43.807 --> 31:47.708
and me and my boy Vinz here we needed a
little break, you know like a vacation.

31:47.710 --> 31:50.310
So Willy hooked us up with a
place to chill for a bit...

31:50.312 --> 31:51.912
Fuck!

31:57.654 --> 31:59.221
Yo, come on!

32:00.522 --> 32:03.192
Come on, Vinz!
We gotta move!

32:23.546 --> 32:27.749
Well, it's a shithole,
but at least we got a place to lay low.

32:27.751 --> 32:29.484
That's what matters.

32:29.486 --> 32:32.220
Just a place to chill
'till shit blows over.

32:35.792 --> 32:38.561
What? Why are the crows
even aggressive?

32:46.002 --> 32:48.369
It's weird
without my roaches.

32:48.371 --> 32:51.940
I read that lost cats can travel, like,
hundreds of miles to find their owner.

32:51.942 --> 32:54.411
I wish my roaches
could do that.

33:02.752 --> 33:07.656
If we're lucky, maybe we'll get
shot before we starve, so there's that.

33:07.658 --> 33:10.758
I was thinking just maybe
we can go to the cops.

33:10.760 --> 33:14.429
- Tell them what happened, they'll let us go.
- Shit, you're right, bruh!

33:14.431 --> 33:16.699
Too bad you didn't say nothin' to
the cops that was in our apartment

33:16.701 --> 33:18.801
tryin' to kill us yesterday.

33:18.803 --> 33:21.839
Oh, snap!
There's a box with a prize?

33:24.975 --> 33:27.677
Man, we even got power?

33:29.046 --> 33:30.746
<i>...are very dangerous.</i>

33:30.748 --> 33:32.815
<i>These two criminals are wanted
for first-degree murder,</i>

33:32.817 --> 33:35.583
<i>violence against the police,
resisting arrest,</i>

33:35.585 --> 33:37.485
<i>and conspiring against
the United States government.</i>

33:37.487 --> 33:38.920
What? Is that us?

33:38.922 --> 33:41.457
<i>If you encounter
these individuals,</i>

33:41.459 --> 33:44.493
<i>please do not approach or engage
them in any way, for your safety.</i>

33:44.495 --> 33:47.029
Jesus, what the fuck
is goin' on, man?

33:47.031 --> 33:49.497
Still feelin' the whole
"turn yourself in" idea?

33:49.499 --> 33:52.468
Wait, wait. Shh, listen.
Turn it up!

33:52.470 --> 33:54.705
<i>...at 666-33...</i>

33:58.876 --> 34:01.542
Ah, no, no, no, no, no!

34:01.544 --> 34:04.346
Yesterday, I was just a normal
fuckin dude mindin' my business,

34:04.348 --> 34:06.584
and today
I'm a goddamn terrorist?

34:08.085 --> 34:10.485
Well, if you look
at the bright side,

34:10.487 --> 34:12.822
at least we don't have to worry about
someone calling the police on us here.

34:44.922 --> 34:46.958
- Huh?
- Hmm?

35:02.773 --> 35:04.674
No fucking around
this time.

35:04.676 --> 35:07.677
You three, with me.
The rest of you, watch the front.

35:07.679 --> 35:10.814
Check out the suits!
Y'all bitches lost or somethin'?

35:10.816 --> 35:16.086
Hey, big boy. Put your dog on
his leash or I'll put him down.

35:16.088 --> 35:18.323
You want us
to handle him, boss?

35:21.392 --> 35:23.392
Who you gon' put down now?

35:23.394 --> 35:25.762
Damn! Looks like you
need a new suit, bitch!

35:28.834 --> 35:31.801
- Ah, shit, they shot Peaches.
- Shit.

35:31.803 --> 35:33.102
Hey!
Everyone, over here!

35:33.104 --> 35:34.539
Huh?

35:39.846 --> 35:42.445
The sooner we take them out,
the sooner we get the kids.

35:42.447 --> 35:45.548
Stop sleeping, man.
Something's goin' on out there!

35:45.550 --> 35:46.785
Come on!

35:47.652 --> 35:49.652
I want those two found now!

35:49.654 --> 35:53.092
Vinz, damn, they found us!

35:58.530 --> 36:02.532
Let's go, dude!
Come on. Move!

36:02.534 --> 36:04.534
They're making a run for it
through the back door!

36:04.536 --> 36:07.039
What are you waiting for?
Get to your cars.

36:09.942 --> 36:14.779
"All the world's a stage, and all the
men and women merely players." Action.

36:22.520 --> 36:25.122
"Tis now the very witching time
of night,

36:25.124 --> 36:29.860
when churchyards yawn and hell itself
breathes out contagion to this world."

36:29.862 --> 36:32.062
Suck this! Suck this!

36:32.064 --> 36:33.598
Get those bitches!

36:35.034 --> 36:37.067
You ain't gettin' away,
motherfuckers.

36:37.069 --> 36:39.105
Eat this. Eat this!

36:40.773 --> 36:44.944
"Now could I drink hot blood and
do such bitter business as..."

36:45.945 --> 36:49.980
What the fuck?
This bootleg motherfucker.

36:49.982 --> 36:53.751
"To be or not to be?
That's the question."

36:53.753 --> 36:56.022
I can quote
Shakespeare too, bitch.

36:59.992 --> 37:01.127
They got Shakespeare.

37:06.732 --> 37:07.833
Drive.

37:28.855 --> 37:32.556
Y'all fuckin' suits shoulda stayed
where you was from.

37:32.558 --> 37:33.991
This Palm Hill.

37:33.993 --> 37:35.260
Hey, you heard me, homey?

37:40.767 --> 37:42.102
Ugh.

37:43.070 --> 37:44.235
Uh-uh.

37:44.237 --> 37:46.073
Oh, shit.
What the fuck was that?

37:47.074 --> 37:49.108
What in the actual fuck
is that?

37:49.942 --> 37:52.077
Yo! Yo, what is that, man?

37:52.079 --> 37:53.714
- Get back!
- I don't know.

37:55.082 --> 37:57.683
Get that shit. Get that.

37:58.251 --> 38:00.085
What the fuck?

38:00.087 --> 38:01.687
Huh?

38:02.655 --> 38:04.091
It's... It's that shadow.

38:07.060 --> 38:09.096
What the fuck
is that thing, Lino?

38:22.976 --> 38:24.044
Huh?

38:26.980 --> 38:28.813
Wait, Lino.
Stop, stop, stop.

38:28.815 --> 38:30.184
This one has keys.

38:36.823 --> 38:39.593
Lino, we're not fucking sellin' ice
cream, bro. Just go!

38:41.695 --> 38:45.597
Lino, pop the clutch and go forward. What
are you doing? Just drive. Drive the car.

38:45.599 --> 38:48.035
Well, I'm sorry! I ain't never
driven no ice cream truck before!

38:53.007 --> 38:56.308
Shit!
Come on, come on, come on!

39:04.385 --> 39:06.185
There you are, fuckers!

39:06.187 --> 39:08.588
They found us!
We gotta fucking go.

39:16.998 --> 39:17.899
Fuck.

39:27.708 --> 39:30.943
<i>What the fuck is going on?</i>

39:30.945 --> 39:34.180
<i>Where are those horrible
tentacled creatures from?</i>

39:34.182 --> 39:37.684
<i>The movies have
never been this insane!</i>

39:38.819 --> 39:42.590
<i>And how does Vinz stay alive
with his head on fire?</i>

39:43.724 --> 39:45.760
<i>Wait, did I just say that?</i>

39:56.304 --> 39:58.973
- Try hitting 'em.
- Just shut up and drive!

40:03.711 --> 40:06.413
Vinz! You gotta
try and slow 'em down.

40:06.415 --> 40:07.880
How?

40:07.882 --> 40:10.017
I dunno, do somethin'.
Anything.

40:11.285 --> 40:13.054
Get me a good angle.

40:20.295 --> 40:21.829
Wipe that shit off!

40:23.931 --> 40:25.933
Huh?

40:27.468 --> 40:28.971
Huh?

40:38.179 --> 40:41.150
Oh, shit!

40:46.821 --> 40:48.856
I'll kill these bastards
myself.

41:06.441 --> 41:07.741
Shit.

41:07.743 --> 41:09.509
How we doin'?
We lost 'em yet?

41:09.511 --> 41:11.812
No, no.
They're still on us!

41:25.027 --> 41:27.963
Here.
Take this, see if it's loaded.

41:29.031 --> 41:31.033
Shoot that at
them, not in here!

41:32.167 --> 41:34.000
What'd you say?

41:34.002 --> 41:37.039
Do it out there,
not in here!

41:54.923 --> 41:56.091
What the...?

42:05.901 --> 42:08.102
Aah!

42:08.104 --> 42:09.537
Uh, Lino?

42:09.539 --> 42:12.040
Looks like the cops
have joined the party.

42:17.180 --> 42:18.915
Lino, red light! Red light!

42:19.848 --> 42:21.351
Grab on to somethin'!

42:47.943 --> 42:49.811
I'll fuckin' kill you!

42:54.217 --> 42:55.451
Shit, shit!

42:57.920 --> 43:00.156
See that?
I told you we'd lose 'em.

43:01.624 --> 43:05.427
Uh, about that, Lino.
They're still here.

43:05.429 --> 43:09.232
No fucking way!
Man, get off my dick!

43:25.281 --> 43:28.583
Vinz, I'm gonna need you to sit your
ass down and buckle the fuck up!

43:28.585 --> 43:29.819
Why?

43:35.291 --> 43:36.527
Wh-What are you doing?

43:38.161 --> 43:41.265
- What I'm doin' is fuckin' handlin' it!
- No, no, no, no!

44:14.431 --> 44:16.601
Alive.
We're alive.

44:50.667 --> 44:52.402
They couldn't have
gotten very far.

44:52.404 --> 44:54.136
I want you to set up
a perimeter.

44:54.138 --> 44:56.539
Start where they were
spotted last.

44:56.541 --> 44:59.510
Get every man on the job
and tighten the net.

45:00.310 --> 45:02.112
The kid is special.

45:06.084 --> 45:09.385
If he actually can tell
Machos from humans,

45:09.387 --> 45:12.423
then we're in
a world of shit.

45:14.358 --> 45:18.060
I promised your mom
I'd find you, kid.

45:18.062 --> 45:20.432
And I'm a man of my word.

45:22.065 --> 45:24.232
<i>In other news,
the neighborhood of Palm Hill</i>

45:24.234 --> 45:26.636
<i>became a veritable war-zone
this afternoon.</i>

45:26.638 --> 45:31.007
<i>What incited the violence
is as of yet unknown.</i>

45:31.009 --> 45:33.543
<i>Long-time rival gangs,
The Grapz and The Limz,</i>

45:33.545 --> 45:37.281
<i>have joined forces against the police
units called in to manage the...</i>

45:39.785 --> 45:42.086
<i>And the violence
only appears to be...</i>

45:43.087 --> 45:45.056
<i>...to nearby neighborhoods.</i>

45:47.091 --> 45:49.692
<i>Thank you, Sarah.
Have there been any reported casualties?</i>

45:49.694 --> 45:52.629
<i>Sources suggest
at least ten killed,</i>

45:52.631 --> 45:54.698
<i>and over 50
seriously injured.</i>

45:54.700 --> 45:58.768
<i>Residents are advised to stay
indoors until further notice.</i>

45:58.770 --> 46:00.636
<i>Please stay safe
out there, Sarah.</i>

46:00.638 --> 46:02.338
<i>We'll keep bringing you
the latest updates</i>

46:02.340 --> 46:04.341
<i>as we get more information
about the devastating riots</i>

46:04.343 --> 46:07.510
<i>playing out on
the Southside of DMC.</i>

46:07.512 --> 46:11.047
<i>And in a shocking new development taking
place on the other side of town...</i>

46:11.049 --> 46:15.319
<i>Our phone lines have apparently
been flooded with eyewitness reports</i>

46:15.321 --> 46:19.523
<i>that a huge colony of insects
has been seen leaving the city</i>

46:19.525 --> 46:21.057
<i>and heading in the direction
of the desert.</i>

46:21.059 --> 46:23.125
Holy shit,
you were right!

46:23.127 --> 46:24.828
<i>We don't yet understand
the cause of this mass migration,</i>

46:24.830 --> 46:26.362
<i>but in this
journalist's opinion,</i>

46:26.364 --> 46:28.699
<i>if even the cockroaches
are fleeing DMC,</i>

46:28.701 --> 46:31.069
<i>what hope remains
for the rest of us?</i>

46:41.714 --> 46:44.715
Man, I really hope Pipo remembers
that huge tip I left him.

46:44.717 --> 46:47.718
I don't know about
this one, Lino.

46:47.720 --> 46:50.321
How long has it been
since we ate somethin'?

46:53.225 --> 46:55.094
Is Pipo even here right now?

46:57.830 --> 46:59.365
I am hungry.

47:08.307 --> 47:09.441
It's her.

47:15.849 --> 47:19.118
- Lino, no, no. Don't go in.
- Trust me on this.

47:26.725 --> 47:30.527
So that's how
we got mixed up in all this.

47:30.529 --> 47:32.262
I-I know it sounds crazy,
but...

47:32.264 --> 47:33.530
I believe you.

47:33.532 --> 47:35.732
I mean, seriously,
and no offense,

47:35.734 --> 47:39.839
but you two don't really look like
intimidating criminal masterminds.

47:42.509 --> 47:45.309
Seriously, there's no way
you two can run forever.

47:45.311 --> 47:48.478
I bet there are tons of ways
to prove you're innocent.

47:48.480 --> 47:51.585
Yeah, I'm pretty sure there's tons
of ways they can frame us too.

47:56.155 --> 47:59.690
Here. You guys look like
you need this more than I do.

47:59.692 --> 48:03.597
Am I the only one that's creeped
out by the fact that Pipo's not back?

48:06.566 --> 48:08.568
Get off me!

48:09.669 --> 48:11.605
Like moths
drawn to the flame.

48:18.878 --> 48:22.346
You did well, Luna.
For once.

48:22.348 --> 48:26.452
See, boys? Follow your brain
instead of your dick.

48:50.644 --> 48:52.443
Hmm.

48:52.445 --> 48:55.546
I remember
the first time I saw them.

48:55.548 --> 48:57.682
I was scared too.

48:57.684 --> 49:01.586
Until I realized they're not
the freaks of nature...

49:01.588 --> 49:02.654
We are.

49:21.709 --> 49:22.709
<i>Mama.</i>

49:25.679 --> 49:26.713
<i>Papa.</i>

49:51.940 --> 49:56.508
<i>Nice to finally make
your acquaintance, Angelino.</i>

49:56.510 --> 49:59.878
Angelino.
Angelino. Angelino. Angelino.

49:59.880 --> 50:02.280
Who are you?

50:02.282 --> 50:04.450
What do you want from us?

50:04.452 --> 50:07.621
And where's Vinz?

50:08.589 --> 50:10.789
<i>Inquisitive young man.</i>

50:10.791 --> 50:13.992
<i>The real question is:
Who are you?</i>

50:13.994 --> 50:18.330
You, Angelino, are a being
unlike any other in this world.

50:18.332 --> 50:23.736
<i>But I imagine you've always
known that, deep down.</i>

50:23.738 --> 50:26.004
<i>But where are my manners?</i>

50:26.006 --> 50:30.309
<i>You may call me Mr. K.</i>

50:30.311 --> 50:32.979
<i>I am of a race
known as the Machos,</i>

50:32.981 --> 50:36.482
<i>spawned from the dark matter
of the universe.</i>

50:36.484 --> 50:40.453
<i>You've felt that delicious surge of
rage and bloodlust course through you,</i>

50:40.455 --> 50:43.390
<i>that uncontrollable desire
for destruction.</i>

50:44.391 --> 50:47.392
I know what you're thinking,
little one.

50:47.394 --> 50:49.628
Your father was
just as stubborn.

50:49.630 --> 50:52.465
You see, he was one of us.

50:52.467 --> 50:54.768
He had so much potential.

50:54.770 --> 50:58.604
That is, until the day he fell in love
and broke our most fundamental law:

50:58.606 --> 51:00.839
Never breed with a human.

51:00.841 --> 51:06.412
Macho blood flows
through you, Angelino.

51:06.414 --> 51:10.016
Your father did you a disservice
entrusting you to the humans.

51:10.018 --> 51:13.019
<i>You've never been one of them,
and you know it.</i>

51:13.021 --> 51:15.488
<i>You belong to the master race.</i>

51:15.490 --> 51:17.991
<i>Yet you live
a wretched existence,</i>

51:17.993 --> 51:21.427
<i>in a wretched city,
surrounded by wretched people,</i>

51:21.429 --> 51:23.997
<i>who despise you
for being different.</i>

51:23.999 --> 51:27.433
<i>Your so-called friends are
only companions in this misery,</i>

51:27.435 --> 51:30.537
<i>failures keeping you from
reaching your true potential.</i>

51:30.539 --> 51:33.840
<i>But now it's time to
spread your wings and fly.</i>

51:33.842 --> 51:36.543
Come be with your own kind,
Angelino.

51:36.545 --> 51:39.914
<i>Upon returning to your cell,
you will kill your friend.</i>

51:39.916 --> 51:42.582
<i>Extinguish the pathetic
existence you've been living</i>

51:42.584 --> 51:44.551
<i>since the day your
wretched mother birthed you</i>

51:44.553 --> 51:46.822
so your life can finally start.

51:50.158 --> 51:54.997
<i>Kill him
and take your rightful place.</i>

51:56.932 --> 51:58.932
Abandon your humanity

51:58.934 --> 52:02.602
and become who you were
always meant to be.

52:02.604 --> 52:04.404
<i>Trust me, my dear boy.</i>

52:04.406 --> 52:07.041
<i>We are offering you
a true family.</i>

52:07.043 --> 52:08.978
Huh? Kill Vinz?

52:11.880 --> 52:14.949
He's almost ready.
You may now send in Luna.

52:14.951 --> 52:16.519
Kill Vinz?

52:21.456 --> 52:22.822
I have to...

52:36.038 --> 52:37.939
- Huh?
- Angelino.

52:40.509 --> 52:43.813
You must be so confused right
now, and I'm so, so sorry.

52:45.114 --> 52:49.849
Embrace your true nature.
I've been where you are too.

52:49.851 --> 52:52.120
You need to accept
who you really are.

52:52.122 --> 52:56.425
Please, Angelino.
This is your destiny.

53:04.767 --> 53:07.170
You and I could do
great things together.

53:08.704 --> 53:10.704
I-I must kill Vinz.

53:13.809 --> 53:15.210
<i>No point fighting it.</i>

53:15.212 --> 53:17.813
<i>The battle has been won.</i>

53:18.681 --> 53:21.649
<i>DMC was just phase one.</i>

53:21.651 --> 53:24.885
<i>We've already begun infiltrating
the economic and financial strata</i>

53:24.887 --> 53:26.955
<i>of every city in the nation.</i>

53:26.957 --> 53:29.690
<i>We are in your police force,
on Wall Street,</i>

53:29.692 --> 53:31.226
<i>in your White House.</i>

53:31.228 --> 53:34.695
<i>Our presence in Congress
allowed us to push through laws</i>

53:34.697 --> 53:38.098
<i>which let us spread our agenda
unhindered throughout the globe.</i>

53:38.100 --> 53:41.602
<i>Cruelty, greed,
corruption, hate.</i>

53:41.604 --> 53:44.105
<i>The earth is our playground.</i>

53:44.107 --> 53:48.676
<i>We Machos sustain ourselves off
the bounty of negative energy</i>

53:48.678 --> 53:52.113
<i>that seeps like magma
from mankind's every pore.</i>

53:52.115 --> 53:55.684
<i>And, believe me,
when it comes to negative energy,</i>

53:55.686 --> 53:59.156
<i>this planet's resources
are truly inexhaustible.</i>

54:09.266 --> 54:11.232
<i>Stay here, Angelino.</i>

54:11.234 --> 54:14.202
<i>Mommy will be right back
for you.</i>

54:14.204 --> 54:15.239
Lino?

54:17.808 --> 54:21.044
<i>I just wanna be...
a somebody.</i>

54:24.147 --> 54:26.482
<i>Mommy's here, sweetie.</i>

54:27.318 --> 54:30.187
<i>Mommy will always
be here for you.</i>

54:37.626 --> 54:40.931
Must kill Vinz.

54:42.666 --> 54:45.800
It's all right.
He's just in shock.

54:45.802 --> 54:50.138
Release him. Take him to the cell
where his skeleton friend is waiting.

54:50.140 --> 54:51.841
Let him make
his own choice.

54:51.843 --> 54:54.176
For the first time
in his miserable existence,

54:54.178 --> 54:57.114
young Angelino will be the
master of his own fate.

54:58.615 --> 55:02.618
And if his pathetic friend
is still alive in the morning,

55:02.620 --> 55:04.554
kill them both.

55:05.622 --> 55:07.622
But, sir,
with all due respect,

55:07.624 --> 55:09.858
why even give him a chance?

55:09.860 --> 55:14.264
The kid is a threat. If he's really that
powerful, why not just eliminate him now?

55:22.906 --> 55:25.707
And that,
my dear Mr. Macchabee,

55:25.709 --> 55:28.711
is the key difference
between our two species.

55:28.713 --> 55:33.715
While you humans don't think twice
about massacring your fellow man,

55:33.717 --> 55:37.153
Machos consider our brothers
and sisters lives to be sacred,

55:37.155 --> 55:38.988
for we share a common ideal.

55:38.990 --> 55:41.926
But I don't expect a human
to grasp such a concept.

55:42.860 --> 55:45.063
- You're dismissed.
- Yes, sir.

55:46.630 --> 55:50.968
Ensure that you do not question
my authority again, Mr. Macchabee.

55:52.136 --> 55:55.405
<i>Father,
you always told me</i>

55:55.407 --> 55:58.209
<i>there was no way I could
survive outside the base,</i>

55:59.210 --> 56:01.010
that I was the only hybrid,

56:01.012 --> 56:04.081
and humans would never
accept me.

56:04.083 --> 56:07.317
- <i>So how was he able to live...?</i>
- And look at his life!

56:07.319 --> 56:09.952
Is that the kind of miserable
existence you want?

56:09.954 --> 56:11.387
<i>I don't have time
for this, Luna.</i>

56:11.389 --> 56:13.422
<i>There are more
important matters to attend to.</i>

56:13.424 --> 56:16.861
Make yourself useful elsewhere.
I will not hear another word of it!

56:31.742 --> 56:36.212
Are we seriously relying on a
swarm of cockroaches for directions?

56:36.214 --> 56:40.252
We should turn around.
This whole thing is fucking nuts.

56:57.902 --> 57:00.903
Lino! Dude, I didn't know where
they took you. I was freakin' out!

57:00.905 --> 57:03.374
I thought probably they killed
you or something, but...

57:03.376 --> 57:05.844
I'm really
glad you're here.

57:07.880 --> 57:09.913
Whoa. Shit, man.
You all right?

57:09.915 --> 57:12.315
We're leaving.
We must part from here.

57:12.317 --> 57:15.353
Why are you talking about, man?
Haven't you seen where we are?

57:15.355 --> 57:18.021
We're in, like, a bunker with
guards and cameras and shit.

57:18.023 --> 57:21.260
It makes Guantanamo
look like a Girl Scout retreat.

57:23.328 --> 57:26.329
Whoever put us here
doesn't want us to ever get out.

57:26.331 --> 57:28.332
They ran all kinds of tests
on me, Lino.

57:28.334 --> 57:30.934
Tests! Electrodes everywhere!

57:30.936 --> 57:35.305
I mean, my head, my body.
They put it on my junk, man. My junk!

57:35.307 --> 57:36.473
Shit's on you, bro.

57:36.475 --> 57:38.509
We finally lost
those assholes...

57:38.511 --> 57:41.245
and you had to go trust
some bitch at Pipo's you barely knew!

57:41.247 --> 57:43.481
I told you somethin'
wasn't right about her.

57:43.483 --> 57:46.351
You had to think with your dick.
I hope it was fuckin' worth it.

57:53.426 --> 57:56.826
Well, congratulations!
Look where your little crush got us.

57:56.828 --> 57:59.262
For real, you need
to shut the fuck up, Vinz.

57:59.264 --> 58:02.902
Man, I don't feel good.
I-I-It's happening.

58:03.836 --> 58:05.169
Uh, Lino?

58:05.171 --> 58:07.505
I can't control it.

58:07.507 --> 58:08.941
Stay back!

58:10.443 --> 58:12.809
Lino, you're starting
to freak me out, man!

58:12.811 --> 58:16.482
I said,
get the fuck away from me!

58:21.287 --> 58:24.821
Lino, you're hurting me.
Cut it out!

58:24.823 --> 58:26.824
There is no Lino!
Lino is gone!

58:26.826 --> 58:30.228
- Lino...
- I am not what you think I am.

58:30.230 --> 58:32.964
That pathetic being you
called Lino was an illusion

58:32.966 --> 58:36.868
whose only purpose
has been to hold me back!

58:38.237 --> 58:41.239
Wretched creature.
Now do you see who I am?

58:41.241 --> 58:44.043
You're my... friend.

58:45.411 --> 58:47.280
Friend?

58:53.820 --> 58:55.886
Looks like that
old bald dude was right.

58:55.888 --> 58:58.256
I really am
just a fucking monster.

58:58.258 --> 59:02.262
Holy shit, man!
What'd those assholes do to you in there?

59:03.062 --> 59:05.131
I'm so sorry, Vinz.

59:05.999 --> 59:08.432
I don't understand.

59:08.434 --> 59:11.402
There's this... There's this
thing inside of me that's just...

59:11.404 --> 59:13.337
Quiet down in there!

59:13.339 --> 59:16.909
Or I'll put my boot up your ass,
I swear to God.

59:19.245 --> 59:22.282
You fuckin' scumbags.

59:25.251 --> 59:27.421
<i>That's it! No dinner
for you shits toni...</i>

59:45.938 --> 59:48.808
Good. Very good.

59:50.978 --> 59:54.046
<i>Sir, we have a security breach
reported at checkpoint 4C.</i>

59:54.048 --> 59:56.550
A security breach?
How's that possible?

01:00:11.898 --> 01:00:14.933
Okay, boys. You survey the
perimeter, I'll check the lab.

01:00:14.935 --> 01:00:17.670
These science nerds and old
farts won't give me any trouble.

01:00:17.672 --> 01:00:19.404
Yeah, try not to fall asleep,
tough guy!

01:00:21.675 --> 01:00:23.943
Fucking Doug.
He's not even funny.

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:36.223
We make our escape
now or never!

01:00:40.595 --> 01:00:42.630
You ignorant sheep.

01:01:17.632 --> 01:01:19.967
You can stay on the ceiling
if you like.

01:01:20.402 --> 01:01:21.634
Vinz?

01:01:21.636 --> 01:01:23.603
You're getting
real close to me, dude.

01:01:23.605 --> 01:01:25.239
Vinz?

01:01:25.607 --> 01:01:27.643
Huh? Huh?

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:34.514
Yo, I think
I'm losing it, man.

01:01:34.516 --> 01:01:35.650
Vinz?

01:01:44.592 --> 01:01:46.628
Who the fuck
are they shooting at?

01:02:06.515 --> 01:02:08.383
Hey, I think we...
You okay?

01:02:12.187 --> 01:02:16.124
Stay with us, bro.
Lino, hold on. Hold on!

01:02:20.596 --> 01:02:22.363
<i>Â¡VÃ¡monos!! Todos!</i>

01:02:23.531 --> 01:02:25.233
Shit! We're lost.

01:02:26.134 --> 01:02:27.536
There's an exit here.

01:02:29.638 --> 01:02:34.307
- Stay with me, Lino.
- Please don't fall asleep.

01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:35.611
Hold on, Lino.

01:02:53.395 --> 01:02:56.563
Daddy?
Daddy, is that you?

01:02:56.565 --> 01:02:59.566
Your mother didn't
abandon you, Son.

01:02:59.568 --> 01:03:02.068
She hid you from them.

01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:05.307
Sacrificed her life
to save yours.

01:03:06.642 --> 01:03:09.678
Your mother loved you
with all her heart.

01:03:13.349 --> 01:03:19.486
I did everything in my power to protect
the two of you, to keep you safe.

01:03:19.488 --> 01:03:21.421
But they were
too strong for me.

01:03:21.423 --> 01:03:22.823
Daddy.

01:03:22.825 --> 01:03:26.060
Become who you truly are,
my son.

01:03:27.731 --> 01:03:29.797
<i>The Machos
are malevolent beings,</i>

01:03:29.799 --> 01:03:33.467
<i>nasty creatures who made a pact
with power-hungry humans.</i>

01:03:33.469 --> 01:03:36.670
<i>But they never truly trusted them.
Not enough to breed with anyway.</i>

01:03:36.672 --> 01:03:39.340
<i>So they created
their own hybrids in a lab.</i>

01:03:39.342 --> 01:03:41.509
<i>Hybrids that feel
neither fear nor pain,</i>

01:03:41.511 --> 01:03:43.377
<i>and aren't burdened
by conscience.</i>

01:03:43.379 --> 01:03:45.646
<i>The perfect fusion
of the two species.</i>

01:03:45.648 --> 01:03:47.381
<i>But this little fella's
different.</i>

01:03:47.383 --> 01:03:50.318
<i>He's the organic, flawed fruit
of a forbidden love.</i>

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:54.522
<i>As you can see, offspring from such
a union inherit traits at random.</i>

01:03:54.524 --> 01:03:56.323
<i>Their potential is limitless.</i>

01:03:56.325 --> 01:03:58.760
<i>Yeah, yeah, Doc.
So how do we kill these Machos?</i>

01:03:58.762 --> 01:04:02.330
<i>Like all creatures from the
pits of Hell, they abhor the cold.</i>

01:04:02.332 --> 01:04:04.399
<i>It's no coincidence
that for decades,</i>

01:04:04.401 --> 01:04:06.801
<i>politicians have been
working surreptitiously</i>

01:04:06.803 --> 01:04:09.504
<i>to bring about an era
of global warming.</i>

01:04:09.506 --> 01:04:13.775
<i>Emitting greenhouse gases, massive
deforestation, subsidizing fossil fuels.</i>

01:04:13.777 --> 01:04:15.543
<i>You get the idea.</i>

01:04:15.545 --> 01:04:17.545
<i>It takes time,
this terraforming.</i>

01:04:17.547 --> 01:04:19.514
<i>By pushing us
towards extinction,</i>

01:04:19.516 --> 01:04:21.883
<i>they've tipped earth's balance
to their favor.</i>

01:04:21.885 --> 01:04:24.284
<i>And why wouldn't they?</i>

01:04:24.286 --> 01:04:26.889
<i>When their years of well-laid plans
could be irrevocably compromised</i>

01:04:26.891 --> 01:04:29.392
<i>by some pesky winter snowstorm.</i>

01:04:57.187 --> 01:04:58.519
Lino!

01:04:58.521 --> 01:05:01.923
Yo, Sleeping Beauty!

01:05:01.925 --> 01:05:04.526
You've been knocked out
for, like, three days, man.

01:05:04.528 --> 01:05:06.929
I wasn't goin' to slip you
the tongue or anything.

01:05:06.931 --> 01:05:08.799
I don't do that.
I'm a gentleman.

01:05:11.301 --> 01:05:13.336
Vinz, where the hell are we?

01:05:16.607 --> 01:05:19.775
- Time for a smoke break.
- Whatever. Just don't do that shit too close to me.

01:05:19.777 --> 01:05:21.442
I don't want anything
to blow up.

01:05:21.444 --> 01:05:23.645
Always "smoke break" this,
"pee break" that.

01:05:23.647 --> 01:05:27.449
I need you gentlemen to hunker down
and focus. We have a world to save!

01:05:27.451 --> 01:05:29.318
There's no way we're
gonna finish this in time.

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:32.888
My word, you lot are worse
than a bunch of whiny teenagers.

01:05:32.890 --> 01:05:35.725
Stick to the plan,
and no more godforsaken breaks.

01:05:36.593 --> 01:05:38.427
<i>â™ª Buh-da-buh-da-buh</i>

01:05:38.429 --> 01:05:40.931
<i>â™ª My name is Feliz
And I have gas â™ª</i>

01:05:44.935 --> 01:05:47.470
Uh, you in here,
skeleton man?

01:05:48.271 --> 01:05:50.675
Hey, the kids went AWOL!

01:05:53.644 --> 01:05:55.944
We didn't belong there, man.
Look at us!

01:05:55.946 --> 01:05:59.416
We can't even save ourselves.
How we gonna save the world?

01:06:52.637 --> 01:06:55.370
<i>When you come to my
show, you're goin' to a war.</i>

01:06:55.372 --> 01:06:58.542
<i>And I'm all for violence,
chaos...</i>

01:07:00.845 --> 01:07:03.847
Anyone who wants to
disappear goes to Mexico, right?

01:07:03.849 --> 01:07:07.650
I don't know. It just doesn't
feel right, skipping town like this.

01:07:07.652 --> 01:07:10.854
I mean, what are we even gonna do down
there? We got no marketable skills.

01:07:10.856 --> 01:07:14.091
W-We'll figure it out, man.
Somehow.

01:07:14.093 --> 01:07:17.694
Whatever. I'm just glad
Willy won't be there.

01:07:17.696 --> 01:07:19.863
Oh, shit,
I forgot about Willy.

01:07:19.865 --> 01:07:22.098
Poor little dude
probably thinks we dead.

01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:24.803
I mean, we were kinda
his only family, right?

01:07:26.404 --> 01:07:29.539
I still got a dollar left.

01:07:29.541 --> 01:07:31.943
The phone's right there
if you wanna hit him up.

01:07:39.384 --> 01:07:44.121
Ah, that must be them. You go off-script,
I'll blow your fuckin' head off.

01:07:44.123 --> 01:07:45.991
Hey, it's ringin'.

01:07:47.526 --> 01:07:49.125
Uh, g-greetings.

01:07:49.127 --> 01:07:51.128
Yo, dude. It's us.
What's good, man?

01:07:51.130 --> 01:07:54.131
Funny you should ask.
I'm kinda in a situation right now.

01:07:54.133 --> 01:07:57.700
Hey! I thought I told you not to pull
anything funny, you little piece of shit.

01:07:57.702 --> 01:08:00.338
Hello? Hello?
Willy? Willy?

01:08:02.407 --> 01:08:04.108
What's up with this
piece of shit phone?

01:08:04.110 --> 01:08:05.508
<i>Uh, hello?</i>

01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:07.011
Oh, good. I hear you now.

01:08:07.013 --> 01:08:09.612
Me and Vinz got some real shit
to fill you in on, bro.

01:08:09.614 --> 01:08:12.549
<i>What a coincidence.
So do I!</i>

01:08:12.551 --> 01:08:15.686
<i>"Capital Info.
Back home now.</i>

01:08:15.688 --> 01:08:17.888
<i>Life or death question?"</i>

01:08:17.890 --> 01:08:19.389
<i>Did I say it right?</i>

01:08:19.390 --> 01:08:21.158
What the fuck
are you talkin' about, dude?

01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:22.826
Hey, is someone there?

01:08:22.828 --> 01:08:25.129
Just come back!
It's a super big emergency.

01:08:25.131 --> 01:08:26.997
I can't talk about it!

01:08:26.999 --> 01:08:29.899
<i>What? Willy, man,
I can't understand you, dude.</i>

01:08:29.902 --> 01:08:31.836
<i>Hey, are you on somethin', bro?</i>

01:08:31.837 --> 01:08:34.037
For real,
you're not making any sense.

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:35.774
Like, "capital info"?
What?

01:08:36.675 --> 01:08:38.743
I don't know what to say.

01:08:39.478 --> 01:08:41.178
Uh-uh.

01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:43.714
I can't tell you over the phone.
Just get your asses here now!

01:08:43.716 --> 01:08:47.117
What? Hello? Willy?

01:08:47.118 --> 01:08:50.087
What's up?
What'd he say?

01:08:50.090 --> 01:08:52.656
He said he needs to tell us
some important shit.

01:08:52.658 --> 01:08:54.524
Then that motherfucker
hung up on me.

01:08:54.527 --> 01:08:56.694
Was actin' real weird
the whole time, man.

01:08:56.696 --> 01:08:58.662
So? He's always weird.

01:08:58.663 --> 01:09:02.800
I don't know, man. Somethin' sounded off.
I think we gotta go back.

01:09:02.801 --> 01:09:05.036
Back to DMC?
Are you' crazy, man?

01:09:05.037 --> 01:09:06.636
Yeah, you're right.
It's too risky.

01:09:06.639 --> 01:09:08.639
Damn straight,
it's too risky.

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:11.676
Willy's a survivor.
He don't need us.

01:09:14.647 --> 01:09:18.616
But if he's really in danger, we can't
just leave our boy hangin' like that.

01:09:18.618 --> 01:09:20.718
Fuck Willy!

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:22.653
How long we gonna keep letting
this douchebag fuck our lives up?

01:09:22.654 --> 01:09:24.688
He's your boy, Lino,
not mine!

01:09:24.689 --> 01:09:26.557
It's not my job
to handle his shit!

01:09:26.559 --> 01:09:28.760
What we have to fucking do
is get outta of here,

01:09:28.761 --> 01:09:32.997
away from the DMC, away from the tentacle
mafia, and from motherfucking Willy.

01:09:32.999 --> 01:09:36.669
He's nothin' but
fucking trouble, man! Ugh!

01:09:38.238 --> 01:09:40.908
Don't just look at me. Let's go save him.

01:09:45.645 --> 01:09:47.446
Hang tight, Willy.

01:09:59.659 --> 01:10:03.862
<i>As DMC police try to quell
the violent riots plaguing the city,</i>

01:10:03.864 --> 01:10:07.065
<i>President Gore Tex made an official
statement, declaring the riots...</i>

01:10:07.067 --> 01:10:09.468
- Hey, hey, check these two out!
- Huh?

01:10:11.271 --> 01:10:13.071
Sit tight, Cat Boy.

01:10:13.073 --> 01:10:17.642
This better be your friends
or you'll be in a world of hurt.

01:10:17.644 --> 01:10:20.578
Your performance
on the phone was shit.

01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:22.781
Let's hope they bought it.

01:10:22.783 --> 01:10:28.187
If not, I might get creative and shove
some fireworks up that furry ass of yours.

01:10:28.189 --> 01:10:30.889
Cause, hey,
I'm feelin' festive!

01:10:30.891 --> 01:10:34.793
Little secret: even as a kid,
I loved torturing animals.

01:10:34.795 --> 01:10:37.230
So part of me hopes
your friends don't show up.

01:10:45.605 --> 01:10:50.142
Oh, for fuck's sake.
I'm sweating my fucking balls off in here.

01:10:50.144 --> 01:10:53.012
It's hotter than Satan's anus
in this piece-of-shit trailer.

01:10:53.014 --> 01:10:56.148
Don't you have a fan in here?
Jesus Christ!

01:10:58.151 --> 01:11:00.151
It can't be.

01:11:00.153 --> 01:11:02.221
No fucking way.
They actually came back.

01:11:02.223 --> 01:11:05.193
Those fuckwits are unbelievable.

01:11:06.995 --> 01:11:09.794
Oh, this is
too perfect.

01:11:09.796 --> 01:11:12.163
Your boyfriends
are here to rescue you.

01:11:12.165 --> 01:11:14.802
Hold it.
Now say "cheese".

01:11:16.170 --> 01:11:18.806
Come on.
Outta the way, asshole!

01:11:20.774 --> 01:11:22.774
Don't move.

01:11:22.776 --> 01:11:25.145
No, no, no.
Stay right there.

01:11:26.781 --> 01:11:29.749
Hey, you little <i>puto,</i>
I'm watching you!

01:11:29.751 --> 01:11:31.786
There you are.

01:11:33.154 --> 01:11:35.189
Son of a bitch.

01:11:37.057 --> 01:11:40.159
Come on.
Show me your eyes.

01:11:40.161 --> 01:11:42.228
Ah.

01:11:42.230 --> 01:11:43.664
Good night.

01:11:44.165 --> 01:11:45.133
No!

01:11:46.234 --> 01:11:47.866
Did you see that?

01:11:47.868 --> 01:11:51.037
Let's get this motherfucker, man!
Get him!

01:11:51.039 --> 01:11:53.239
Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:11:53.241 --> 01:11:54.876
Where'd that come from?

01:11:56.210 --> 01:11:57.612
No.

01:11:58.379 --> 01:11:59.747
<i>Â¡Puta madre!</i>

01:12:03.851 --> 01:12:06.152
Shit! Those shots
came from Willy's!

01:12:10.191 --> 01:12:11.225
Oh, man.

01:12:20.835 --> 01:12:21.969
Yaa!

01:12:24.839 --> 01:12:26.275
Willy!

01:12:54.236 --> 01:12:57.337
<i>What you're witnessing is

01:13:04.046 --> 01:13:05.712
<i>Wait, hold on.</i>

01:13:05.714 --> 01:13:08.014
<i>I can see a man climbing
onto the roof of a trailer.</i>

01:13:08.016 --> 01:13:10.016
<i>Is it another terrorist? No.</i>

01:13:10.018 --> 01:13:13.018
<i>Uh, he looks like
a lone wolf gunman!</i>

01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:16.123
Oh, you want a fuckin' war?
Then you'll get one!

01:13:16.125 --> 01:13:17.926
Say hello
to my little friend!

01:13:19.027 --> 01:13:20.427
Man, we gotta save Willy.

01:13:20.429 --> 01:13:23.029
Huh? Are you crazy?
That's suicide!

01:13:23.031 --> 01:13:26.766
But if I don't try,
I won't be able to live with myself.

01:13:26.768 --> 01:13:28.238
Know what I'm sayin'?

01:13:30.005 --> 01:13:33.073
I may be a loser,
but I'm not a fuckin' coward!

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:34.407
Lino, wait!

01:13:34.409 --> 01:13:36.044
Fuckin' Willy.

01:13:42.017 --> 01:13:43.652
Get the fuck outta here,
<i>pendejo!</i>

01:13:45.354 --> 01:13:46.453
Wrong way!

01:13:46.455 --> 01:13:49.725
Run, you little punk!

01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:56.064
I got him!

01:14:05.041 --> 01:14:07.676
What took you
douchebags so long?

01:14:20.423 --> 01:14:24.492
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we

01:14:37.039 --> 01:14:38.473
Ahh.

01:14:38.475 --> 01:14:40.109
Vaya con Dios.

01:14:41.945 --> 01:14:43.846
It's out of our hands now.

01:14:54.224 --> 01:14:56.224
<i>The UFO just exploded!</i>

01:14:56.226 --> 01:14:58.261
<i>This must be the work

01:15:06.503 --> 01:15:07.835
- Hey!
- Huh?

01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:10.037
W-What's goin' on?

01:15:10.039 --> 01:15:12.141
- Come on!
- Huh?

01:15:21.585 --> 01:15:23.517
Lino?

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:25.221
Lino!

01:15:40.004 --> 01:15:41.138
Huh?

01:15:48.077 --> 01:15:51.415
Uh, Doc.
This wasn't part of the plan.

01:15:53.984 --> 01:15:57.020
Wait for the temperature
to drop. You'll see.

01:16:04.028 --> 01:16:08.030
Lino!
Holy shit, you're all right.

01:16:08.032 --> 01:16:09.864
What the hell was that
in the sky?

01:16:09.866 --> 01:16:11.866
You think it was
the <i>Luchador</i> rocket?

01:16:11.868 --> 01:16:14.038
I don't know.
Why is it so cold?

01:17:14.999 --> 01:17:17.433
Yo, it's snowing
in the DMC!

01:17:17.435 --> 01:17:19.000
That's sick!

01:17:19.002 --> 01:17:20.305
Shit, Lino!

01:17:21.406 --> 01:17:23.639
I-I can't...
I can't move!

01:17:23.641 --> 01:17:25.443
I'm freezing up inside!

01:17:26.712 --> 01:17:28.446
I'm scared, Vinz.

01:17:31.249 --> 01:17:35.286
Whoa! Lino, you're
turning into a popsicle.

01:17:37.255 --> 01:17:41.023
Hey, you're not allowed
to die on us, okay?

01:17:41.025 --> 01:17:43.393
I think I see the light
at the end of the tunnel.

01:17:43.395 --> 01:17:45.261
It's in front of me.

01:17:45.263 --> 01:17:48.398
Then make a fucking U-turn!
Don't go into the light!

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.467
Huh?

01:17:50.469 --> 01:17:53.405
You got a lot of nerve showing your
face around here after what you did.

01:17:57.008 --> 01:18:01.044
Man, leave us the fuck alone! You've been
nothing but trouble since we met you!

01:18:11.156 --> 01:18:13.459
Lino, please don't
fall for this shit again.

01:18:19.230 --> 01:18:21.634
Oh, shit, Lino.

01:18:22.735 --> 01:18:25.602
My heart.
It's warming up.

01:18:25.604 --> 01:18:27.771
You did the same for me.

01:18:27.773 --> 01:18:30.643
Thank you for showing me
there's another way, Angelino.

01:18:31.610 --> 01:18:34.043
I believed no one
would accept me,

01:18:34.045 --> 01:18:36.679
that they'd hate me,
so I hated them first.

01:18:36.681 --> 01:18:40.617
But feeding on hatred
leaves such a bitter taste.

01:18:40.619 --> 01:18:44.657
I'm quickly learning I much prefer
the sweetness of a stolen kiss.

01:18:45.524 --> 01:18:47.091
Guys.

01:19:02.742 --> 01:19:05.309
Why are you so desperate
to be like them?

01:19:05.311 --> 01:19:07.311
Hey, you fucking <i>pendejo!</i>

01:19:20.292 --> 01:19:22.693
They made me lose
my train of thought.

01:19:22.695 --> 01:19:24.597
Where were we?

01:19:35.241 --> 01:19:37.208
Mmm.

01:19:37.210 --> 01:19:39.279
This has never
happened to me.

01:19:40.145 --> 01:19:41.515
Get the fuck away from her!

01:20:12.177 --> 01:20:13.745
Fight, Angelino!
Do somethin'!

01:20:13.747 --> 01:20:15.680
Free your inner
tentacle monster, dude!

01:20:15.682 --> 01:20:18.718
- You have to!
- I'd rather die.

01:20:23.222 --> 01:20:26.059
Well, you're about to, Lino.
Get up! Transform!

01:20:37.437 --> 01:20:39.472
Oh, shit, he's gonna kill him!

01:20:42.842 --> 01:20:45.310
<i>Abandon your humanity</i>

01:20:45.312 --> 01:20:48.846

01:20:58.858 --> 01:21:02.496
<i>Become who you
truly are, my son.</i>

01:21:08.168 --> 01:21:12.105
No beast.
Today it's gonna be you and me.

01:21:16.377 --> 01:21:20.211
What are you doing, man?
You got tentacles! Use them!

01:21:20.213 --> 01:21:24.818
Hell no. I'm never letting that
monster control me ever again.

01:21:25.786 --> 01:21:27.419
Sort that shit out
in therapy, man.

01:21:27.421 --> 01:21:29.757
You need to Hulk out
or you're dead!

01:21:31.592 --> 01:21:33.661
I'm-a bust a cap
in your ass, dude.

01:21:34.929 --> 01:21:37.164
You're not gonna know
what hit you.

01:21:57.985 --> 01:22:01.723
Uh, it looks like you guys got this!
See you back at Pipo's!

01:22:07.862 --> 01:22:11.563
Such power at your disposal,
and you did nothing with it.

01:22:21.876 --> 01:22:24.478
Because
you're a goddamn coward.

01:22:25.881 --> 01:22:28.917

on the wrong side of a gun.

It's getting cold again.

01:24:10.052 --> 01:24:13.322
So, Doc,
you think we got rid of 'em?

01:24:14.690 --> 01:24:16.291
I mean, for good?

01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:22.362
