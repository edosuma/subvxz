00:01.000 --> 00:04.000
A demon will come to these lands,

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
join forces with the dark.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
Apparently it's in some prophecy.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
I can't be doing with the buggers,

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
but this one has a knack
of always getting things right.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
-I am the Keeper of the Lake.
-And the maiden is coming.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
She will lead us!

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
-What?
-Got a problem? Tell it the gods.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
-That caught my attention.
-Father.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
You're not working for the emperor.
So who?

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
I will give you some advice. Run.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
I am Queen Amena,
sister to Queen Andra.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
-You came as Rome's lackey.
-No.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
The demon is Rome,
and you will be burned.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
Life is about three things.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
First thing,
everything which is born will die.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
Number two, absolutely everything
you see...

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
-Everything you hear is true.
-...is a lie.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Once upon a time,
there was a princess.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Her dad, the King, raped her,
she became with a child.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Her mother, the Queen
said it was the will of the gods.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
The third, and most important thing
is this...

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
The child was born,
they named her Andra.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
And nobody knew the truth.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Thanks, that cleared things up for me.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
-Any questions?
-Where am I?

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
The prophecy, the whole story,
it's about to come crashing down.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
It's called Isca.
The holiest place.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
Take the cavalry. Main force, three days
straight, and through the final night.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
-We'll hit the Devni on the fourth.
-What is the mission?

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
-A routine reconnaissance.
-With the whole legion?

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
It seems in my absence,
you've become a military expert.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
-Hang on a minute. That's me.
-There are no orders for this.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
No imperial orders. You can't do it.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Would you leave us?

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Who is it you serve?

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Because whoever it is, I know this...

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
It's not the emperor, it's not Rome.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
You know what, Domitius,
I admire you. All the hard work,

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
the sheer dedication you put in to
being a pointless irritating twerp.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
It's amazing,
you've got it down, haven't you?

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
This busybody game.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
And you know what?
Those efforts, I'm gonna reward them.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
I'll tell you the whole story.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
Before there was an empire,
before the first emperor,

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
before the palaces and the temples

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
and the gods that we Romans whistled up
to help us through the day,

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
to give us strength and comfort.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Before any of that...

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
There was one force,

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
one being who controlled everything.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
-His name is Lokka.
-This is sacrilege.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
And all the time I have been here
has been on his time.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
Every move, every choice,
is to serve his will.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
Every man in this legion
is here for the same thing.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Even you, Domitius,
you just don't know it.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
You see here,
we are facing another force,

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
a force that would destroy Lokka,

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
a force that is getting stronger
with every passing day.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
But Lokka is wily,
we have it surrounded.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
With the help of the locals,
so to speak. So that's why I am here.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
So I hope that clears things up?

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
This is an absolute outrage.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
No, Domitius.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
This is an absolute outrage.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
I've been longing for this
all the while.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
On the way back,
I've been passing the time

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
by imagining the look
on your sweaty face.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
Your bulging, beady eyes...

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
..your stupid gurgling.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
You know what?

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
It's just as much fun as I imagined.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Vitus, old chap. Wherever the fuck
you've been, welcome back.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
-General.
-Perfect timing.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Can you put him in the pit?

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
-Is there a problem? Splendid.
-No, General.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Now, where the fuck was I?

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
When I look into my window

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
And many sights to see

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
And when I look in my window

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
So many different people to be

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Oh, no

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
Must be the season of the witch

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
Must be the season of the witch

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Must be the season of the witch

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
The rapids running in the ditch

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
Beatniks out to make it rich

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Oh, no

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Must be the season of the witch

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Ania, Ania, Ania.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
-You found Veran's burrow.
-We were too late.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
Nonetheless,
I had a feeling about you.

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
I thought, "Now there's a clever stick."
I wasn't wrong, was I?

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
Veran left something. May I see it?

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
They were headed east.
The tracks are fresh.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
-Do we hunt them down, Master?
-No.

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
That's not the way to defeat my brother.
Break camp. We're moving out.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
Every moment she lives,
brings us closer to doom.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
You surprise me, Aunt Cara.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
The worst happens and yet your eyes
are still on my sister's fate.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
She is poison.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
Just being near her poisons you too.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Before you knew she was Rome's queen,

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
you considered her coming here a curse.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Why fear my sister so?

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
She casts a shadow over Isca.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
-Oh. You all right?
-No dawdling. We're almost there.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
This is it. We're here.
The Golden Glade.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
No resting. Rest afterwards.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
Now, you'll have to use your instincts
in the caves.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
-How you feeling?
-Dizzy.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
-A bit sick.
-Excellent.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
-Can I come?
-No. Keep stirring.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Add the nettles slowly.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
When she returns she'll need this soup.
Very important.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
-I want to come with you.
-Do you remember where you're from?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
-No.
-Who you are?

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
See...

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
Mostly, the gods choose the wisest
and the strongest as their instruments.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
But on occasion they choose...

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
..dim wits. The bewildered.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Plain idiots.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Who knows why?

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Who are we to question?

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
My point is,
you may have a purpose here.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
Or you may just be my bad luck.
We'll work it out.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
Until then, eagle boy,
make yourself fucking useful.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
-Ow.
-Oh, poor baby.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
Why was I chosen to be a Keeper?

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
-Why not my sister?
-It was the will of the gods.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
Mother... You need to help me.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
The past is fog.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
My darling...

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
..it's a long forgotten dream.

10:21.000 --> 10:26.000
Mother, why did Veran not choose Amena?
I need to know.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
The only one who can answer
your question is Veran.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Only Veran.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
What did the Druids hide here?

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
We won't find it unless you concentrate.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
Look. This is part of the final task.
Think how far we've come.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Everything I suffered to get us here.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
Here. Finish the task tonight.
You'll be ready.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
Ready to find the Leg of Tears.
To meet the Keeper.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
But if you mess it up...

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
..it will all be in vain,
the whole thing,

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
and to be honest,
since eagle toes showed up,

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
your concentration wavers.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Yes, it's much weaker.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
-A mentor notices these things.
-I feel something.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Something close.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
You. Burn it.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
I hear you, friend. Do you need help?

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
Call out again. Speak now, friend.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
Your silence makes me
fear your purpose.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Ye gods. No...

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
-He said you should eat.
-I'm not hungry.

14:43.000 --> 14:49.000
He looks after you, doesn't he?
He protects you.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
-Mostly.
-Mostly.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Something happened once.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
-He hurt you?
-No, it was...

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
It doesn't matter. It was a long
time ago. It wasn't his fault.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
There's something inside him,
something he can't control.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
-I must sound mad.
-No.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
No... I believe you.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
Speaking of horrible, eat.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
This took me a long time.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Well, it's delicious.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
-I'm glad you're here.
-Really?

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
I don't think he is.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Why do you think he lets me stay?

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Don't tell him I told you.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
But the prophecy...
The one we talk about...

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Yeah.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
It's complicated.
But you might have a part in it.

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
Me? How?

16:35.000 --> 16:41.000
Prophecies, they're not straightforward.
Not always true.

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
But this one... This one says...

16:47.000 --> 16:52.000
-If I ever falter...
-If you ever falter...

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
..I'll rest in the arms of the eagle.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
Here. Drink. Whatever you're doing here,
it's no good.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
You're wrong.
He sees who we all are.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
-He sees us truly.
-You're his prisoner.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
The world is my prison.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
-Following him, I'm free.
-You follow a demon.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
Veran is the demon.
Harka showed me his lies.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
-Right there. See?
-Do you know what this says?

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
My sister was a sacrifice.
He lied to her.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
And he writes it down here.
To humiliate her.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
These runes, I can read them,
they taught me.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
They do not speak of sacrifice.

17:43.000 --> 17:48.000
They say, your beloved brother
will carry the flame you kindled.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
-No.
-I swear on the life of our boy.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Pump! Pump it.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
Like this! Now you go.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
Faster. Faster. Pump. Pump.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Now pay attention.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
Behold, the sacred Crucible of Adona.

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
Buried four hundred years ago
by Veran himself. Keep pumping.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
-What's it for?
-To smelt the Golden Hoard.

18:38.000 --> 18:44.000
And so complete your trials
of Earth, Air, Water...

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
And, tonight... Fire.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
The bracelet of Nuada,
first goddess of the Sky and Wind.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
The golden scroll of Gorboduc.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
The cobra of mighty Osiris.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
The great torc of Rud Hud Hudibras...

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Nice. Where do I fit in?

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Excellent question.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
When the moon descends,

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
the Crucible of Adona
is borne from the fire,

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
down the path of Moggon.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
No footprints,
there can be no footprints...

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
..delivering it to the stone of Oshin.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Over here. Follow me.

19:31.000 --> 19:38.000
Where its sacred, molten contents
will forge the great Golden Bow...

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
Hold on. Borne across.
Who bears it across?

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
You. Who do you think?

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
And without a single footprint.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
Sod the footprints.
It's a red hot ruddy crucible.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
-The runes keep it cool.
-Do they?

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
It's what it says on the crucible.
On the rim thing...

19:57.000 --> 20:02.000
Cooling runes...
To keep the molten crucible cool.

20:02.000 --> 20:07.000
Not cool exactly.
Less, less... scalding.

20:09.000 --> 20:14.000
It's the Trial Of Fucking Fire. It's not
the trial of have-a-lie-down-and-relax.

20:14.000 --> 20:19.000
-If I make it across the path of...
-Moggon.No footprints. Important that.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Nobody mentioned a golden bow.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
-What's the bow for?
-For you. I don't need a golden bow.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
Because it sounds a lot like,
at some point,

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
probably quite soon,
I'm going to have to fight someone.

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
Someone you can only fight
with a fucking magic bow.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
I didn't say that.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
Maybe you just wear it.
Maybe you shoot Lokka. We don't know.

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
-Shoot Lokka?
-Maybe. Or not. Only time will tell.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Come here. Come here. Come here.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
Stop showing off. In front of...

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
-I'm not.
-You are.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
-I can tell.
-I'm not.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
I can tell.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
-Keep pumping.
-I won't let you hurt her.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
-Excuse me?
-I said I won't let you hurt her.

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
Nobody hurts her.
I won't let that happen.

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
How is Kerra today?
Got anything to say for herself?

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
-You lied to me.
-What was that now?

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
You fucking know. Snake.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Shall I let you in to a secret?

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
One my brother would hate me
for spilling.

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
Runes are nothing.
They don't mean anything.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
They mean anything you want.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
Or rather, anything he wants.

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
Ha. Did I just say that? Did I?

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
-You don't control me. You don't.
-That's it.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
Wonderful. Here's another secret,
I never did.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
It was all in there, all of it.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
I'm just a boy,
a little boy lost like you.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
-Get away from me!
-That's it, Prince.

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
Are you waking up?
Are you finding your feet?

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
-Phelan of the Cantii.
-Fuck you. You have no power over me.

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
As long as I can remember,
I've had faces, voices crowding me.

23:47.000 --> 23:53.000
Before I could walk,
I listened to elders, aunts, Druids,

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
guiding, instructing.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
But I learnt to hear the voice
beneath their words.

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
It always said the same thing.
She's not ready.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
Not yet. The truth must wait.

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
I hear that voice from you too.
I've heard it since you came.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Tell me why you really came here?

24:32.000 --> 24:36.000
Tell me what I'm too blind to see.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
Speak. The truth may spare you.

24:49.000 --> 24:54.000
-I only came to save you.
-Now I can save you.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Sister, please.

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
I cannot... I cannot speak...

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
I cannot. Forgive me.

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
I've spent my whole life here.
My father before me.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
The Romans killed him. I was a prisoner.

25:42.000 --> 25:47.000
I cheeked this one Roman,
then this other one, he put my eyes out.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
But I found it was part
of a bigger story.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
There was a path set for me.
There is for all of us.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
Take my daughter.
The Druids say she's the Chosen One.

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
She is going to drive the Romans
back into the sea. It's in a prophecy.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
You'll have to excuse me.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
When company does show up,
I talk too much.

26:09.000 --> 26:14.000
-So, what brings you here?
-I don't know.

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
-Say that again.
-I don't know.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
One more time.

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
I don't know...

26:45.000 --> 26:51.000
What was I just talking about?
Oh, yes, that's it. Getting blinded.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
The one who did it to me.
I'd remember him.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
I'd pick him out in a crowd. His voice.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
His breath. I'd know him anywhere.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Think about it.

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
If he hadn't done it,
then I'm not the blind father,

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
and Cait's not the daughter
of the blind father,

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
and the prophecy is not the prophecy.

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
So no. I don't blame him.

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
In fact, if he were to walk in here now,

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
I'd thank him. I'd shake his hand.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
I'm sorry.

27:36.000 --> 27:41.000
Just promise me this,
if your paths should cross,

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
you'll take care of her.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
-I will.
-It's good.

27:53.000 --> 27:58.000
This is good. It's a good twist.
It all makes perfect sense.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
Once you get the hang
of the prophecy stuff,

28:01.000 --> 28:07.000
it all becomes clear. Well, it's all
upside down and back to front.

28:07.000 --> 28:12.000
Most people would think
I was unlucky. But...

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
I found my path.
Now you must find yours, mate.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
You need to find your path.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
Because I've got a sneaking suspicion

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
that you're gonna have a part
to play in all this.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Ready?

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
We'll do this first bit together.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
You're leaving footprints. Concentrate.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Concentrate now.

29:30.000 --> 29:34.000
All right, stop.
You'll have to try it with this...

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
-No.
-Please try.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
Please.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
Walk to the rock. You can do it.

30:06.000 --> 30:10.000
-Please, I can't. I can't!
-Please try. Please.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
I can't.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
No, no, no, no, no.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Thank you.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
You should wrap it.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
-Wrap it in shade leaf.
-It doesn't hurt.

32:13.000 --> 32:17.000
No? That thing was pretty hot.

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
Yeah, it must have been.
-You didn't feel it?

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
No.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
Who taught you to walk like that?

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
-Walk like the air.
-What do you mean?

32:28.000 --> 32:32.000
Did your old man know a few tricks?
Taught them to you...

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
those long nights back there in...

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
where was it you're from?

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Did he show you this one?

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Have you ever seen this?

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Look at it.

32:55.000 --> 33:02.000
It's called Big Pebble.
Isn't it nice and round and pebbly?

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Feels nice. Try it.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
-Touch it.
-It's nice.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
I'll let you stroke it.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Like that. Good.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
Now Big Pebble has a few questions.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Would you like to hear them?

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Keep looking at Big Pebble.

33:31.000 --> 33:35.000
Who sent you here? Any fool can
get an eagle on their back.

33:36.000 --> 33:40.000
But you know a powerful master,
don't you?

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Let's tell Big Pebble all about them.

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
-Big Pebble.
-That's right. Now who was it?

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
-Feels smooth.
-Doesn't it?

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Doesn't it?

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
Smooth and cool

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
and shiny.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Big Pebble.

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
Your task here is over. Let go of it.

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
That's nice. Thank you.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
I know what's inside you.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
-I know all about Pwykka.
-Oh. That's not so good.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
My name is Love.

34:33.000 --> 34:37.000
-I was sent by the Dead Man.
-Oh, dear, that's bad.

34:37.000 --> 34:42.000
Harka will destroy Veran's prophecy.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
He will destroy the Chosen One.

34:46.000 --> 34:50.000
That's why I'm here. And you...

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
You're going to help.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
I'll speak. I'll speak.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Andra!

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
I'm not sure we've met.

35:28.000 --> 35:32.000
-Let me introduce myself.
-I know who you are.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
Surprised?

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
-Trifle scared?
-I'm not scared of you.

35:37.000 --> 35:42.000
Surprised, are we?
He didn't mention I was around...

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Might drop by.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
That's just... That's just like him.

35:52.000 --> 35:56.000
He likes secrets and lies.

35:57.000 --> 36:01.000
-This place is built on them.
-Andra.

36:03.000 --> 36:07.000
Andra, I'll speak! I'll speak.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
How would you say, it's going, your role

36:12.000 --> 36:16.000
Keeper of the Lake of Tears?
That's a tough job.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
When the gods choose us,
that's a dark day.

36:19.000 --> 36:26.000
If you haven't been there, Keeper,
then how do you know it's safe?

36:27.000 --> 36:31.000
How can you keep it safe
if you don't even know where it is?

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
-Anything could be going on.
-I trust Veran. I love...

36:34.000 --> 36:39.000
La, la, la, la... Veran tells the truth.
Because Veran never lies.

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
Tell me, why do you think
you were chosen over your sister?

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
-I do not question the gods.
-And then she disappeared.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Quite the chain of events.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Let me tell you something
about your sister.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
-Your sister...
-Andra!

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
-As lovely as she is
-I will speak now.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
Your lovely sister... Is not...
-Andra, I will speak.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
-Your... Sister...
-Andra!.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Ask your father.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
My father is in the Underworld.

37:21.000 --> 37:25.000
Is he? Who told you that? Was it Veran?

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
Andra! Andra!

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
What are you saying?

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Tell me.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
Tell me, where is my father?

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Now it falls.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Now the silence...

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Hundreds of years...

38:43.000 --> 38:47.000
Our voices have formed the river
that joins us to the gods.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
The river is poisoned.

38:52.000 --> 38:57.000
Veran himself fed that poison.

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
Our faith lies shattered.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
My daughter.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
By the gods.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
No. No! No!

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
No! No!

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
No! No!

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
Oh!

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
We need to get out of here.
He tried to kill me.

41:15.000 --> 41:20.000
There is a demon in him. Pwykka.
Its name is Pwykka! Come on.

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
-We need to go! No, now!
-Wait!

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Wait. Wait!

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
We don't need this. We don't need this.
