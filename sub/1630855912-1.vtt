01:03.980 --> 01:06.649
Alessia, how do you feel about death?

01:07.275 --> 01:10.111
Honestly, I've never thought about it.

01:10.195 --> 01:12.864
I think if someone has to die, they will.

01:12.947 --> 01:15.784
Honestly, I don't think about death.
I'm not afraid of death.

01:15.867 --> 01:18.495
I've never thought free diving
could lead to death.

05:12.937 --> 05:14.939
Okay, look at me.

07:36.831 --> 07:41.711
Alessia was born
in the afternoon, at around 20 to five.

07:43.671 --> 07:48.426
That night, I lay awake in bed, thinking

07:50.344 --> 07:52.555
about my wife, about my daughter.

07:54.056 --> 07:55.766
You never forget it.

07:58.603 --> 08:02.773
When you long for something…

08:04.859 --> 08:06.152
you can't forget it.

08:08.696 --> 08:10.615
This is one of Alessia's school essays.

08:11.449 --> 08:15.703
"Do you ever think that
the people around you, your classmates,

08:15.786 --> 08:17.914
your friends, your parents,

08:17.997 --> 08:19.832
don't understand your dreams?"

08:24.712 --> 08:28.257
I want to achieve my dream at all costs.

08:31.135 --> 08:33.429
I want to become a famous free diver.

08:38.434 --> 08:41.229
Natalia Molchanova is my greatest idol.

08:44.357 --> 08:47.777
I want to be just like her,
a world champion.

08:59.497 --> 09:03.042
I'm really embarrassed
about this great dream of mine.

09:05.378 --> 09:09.632
It sounds like one of those things
you say when you're a kid

09:09.715 --> 09:12.677
when asked what you want to be
when you grow up.

09:14.929 --> 09:17.932
There are only a few people
who understand my dream.

09:18.808 --> 09:21.352
My dad is one of those people.

09:23.104 --> 09:26.983
He understands my passion
for the sea and for free diving.

09:32.321 --> 09:36.409
I'd do anything
to make my dream come true.

09:47.295 --> 09:52.133
If you don't have
a dream to spur you on, you won't make it.

09:53.050 --> 09:56.387
But the price you pay

09:57.179 --> 09:58.514
is so high.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.815
Alessia and Steve.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.319
Their connection was very strong.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.240
What brought them together?

10:19.994 --> 10:21.662
I've always believed

10:21.746 --> 10:26.334
that nothing ever happens to us by chance.

10:29.795 --> 10:32.548
There's always a connecting thread.

10:34.717 --> 10:38.804
Something that leads you
down a certain road.

13:26.597 --> 13:30.226
By the time
I was 13, I knew what I wanted to do.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.483
It wasn't easy to find a class
when I was a kid.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.069
They were all men.

13:49.995 --> 13:53.332
I remember
Alessia turning up with her dad.

13:54.208 --> 13:56.794
This little girl with blue eyes.

13:56.877 --> 14:00.923
I remember that I didn't even hear
Alessia's voice. She just laughed.

14:16.063 --> 14:19.775
I think I had done about 100 meters.

14:21.485 --> 14:24.613
It took us many years
to reach those numbers.

14:34.456 --> 14:37.251
The kid did 105 meters.

14:43.716 --> 14:48.429
That's when
you ask yourself some questions!

14:50.681 --> 14:52.474
How will it all end?

14:56.228 --> 15:00.149
We went to some competitions
for free diving in the sea.

15:02.109 --> 15:08.282
They dived from the boat
using a rock as a counterweight.

15:13.829 --> 15:16.540
And I said,
"Let's see how deep I can go."

15:22.713 --> 15:24.465
By holding your breath,

15:24.548 --> 15:27.384
you get to understand
a lot more about yourself.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.282
I managed to descend to 52 meters.

16:00.167 --> 16:03.504
To see such a young girl

16:03.587 --> 16:07.841
reach such depths

16:07.925 --> 16:10.135
attracted a lot of attention.

16:15.307 --> 16:19.520
And then the federation
releases a statement

16:19.603 --> 16:25.442
banning under-18s
from taking part in official competitions.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.366
In my darkest moments, I cried.

16:33.867 --> 16:39.665
There were arguments with my father,
with my coach.

16:41.542 --> 16:44.545
At that moment, I said,
"What am I going to do now?"

19:06.770 --> 19:08.188
What's your name?

19:09.565 --> 19:11.483
-Stephen?
-Yes.

19:11.567 --> 19:14.695
-Huh. Are you Christian?
-Yes.

19:14.778 --> 19:17.072
-In Ireland, we are--
-Protestant?

19:17.156 --> 19:18.323
No, Catholic.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.958
Yes?

20:50.040 --> 20:52.251
I wanted free diving to be my life.

20:53.001 --> 20:56.213
So even though I saw four years
as a really long time,

20:56.296 --> 20:59.174
I said, "Okay.
Come on, let's keep doing this."

21:04.346 --> 21:06.890
Plenty of others would have said, "Okay."

21:07.474 --> 21:11.019
"I'll do something else."

21:11.728 --> 21:14.064
But not her. She carried on regardless.

21:17.734 --> 21:20.028
She continued going to the pool,

21:20.529 --> 21:21.738
to the sea.

21:25.617 --> 21:29.913
Then you realize
there's something that drives her.

21:33.292 --> 21:36.878
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

21:36.962 --> 21:38.380
Once she turned 18…

21:40.173 --> 21:42.301
she suddenly arrived, like a rocket.

21:52.352 --> 21:55.731
She immediately showed her potential.

22:01.695 --> 22:03.739
150 meters in the pool.

22:04.948 --> 22:06.575
At first, it was, "Wow."

22:09.536 --> 22:11.705
But Ilaria was better.

22:13.165 --> 22:16.501
I certainly wasn't expecting this result.

22:41.276 --> 22:45.072
Here's Alessia Zecchini.
Near the 200-meter wall.

22:45.155 --> 22:46.948
Let's see if she turns.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.326
No, she's coming out.

22:57.626 --> 23:00.128
It was really tough.

23:01.171 --> 23:04.508
I knew if I pushed more,
I wouldn't have come out well.

23:05.801 --> 23:06.927
Go on, Ilaria!

23:21.066 --> 23:24.986
When someone out there
is stronger than you,

23:25.737 --> 23:27.906
it becomes another motivation.

23:33.078 --> 23:36.706
I had to improve
so much to set an Italian record.

23:38.708 --> 23:43.296
For me, it took watching Natalia's videos
to realize how I could get there.

23:45.465 --> 23:49.594
My advice
is that mental relaxation

23:49.678 --> 23:51.847
is the foundation of free diving.

23:52.806 --> 23:57.477
If we want to be successful underwater,

23:57.561 --> 24:03.316
we should be relaxed,
not running towards some goal.

24:25.380 --> 24:27.591
That's good. Stop.

24:32.387 --> 24:36.308
An amazing
224-meter performance.

24:42.147 --> 24:44.649
Congratulations
for this new Italian title.

24:44.733 --> 24:47.444
Yes, it's amazing. At last!

25:40.038 --> 25:42.123
With the lads in Ethiopia.

31:04.988 --> 31:08.408
Diving the Arch has left
a lasting impression on me.

32:43.836 --> 32:47.548
I don't know.
Of course, it's a dream.

32:48.091 --> 32:50.510
Really, a dream for every athlete,
I think.

32:50.593 --> 32:53.137
But it's really difficult.

33:34.262 --> 33:36.806
I want to improve
by a few meters.

33:36.889 --> 33:39.434
In fact, I hope to go
well beyond 90 meters,

33:40.560 --> 33:44.605
to then touch the three-digit number
in a couple of years.

33:47.066 --> 33:52.321
Everybody must have a dream
and put all their effort in.

33:52.405 --> 33:54.615
And really, everything is possible.

34:08.212 --> 34:09.922
The deeper I'm diving,

34:10.006 --> 34:13.426
the pressure compresses
the air in my lungs,

34:14.093 --> 34:18.056
until my lungs are the size of my fist.

34:25.021 --> 34:29.358
After 30 meters,
the pressure pushes me down.

34:31.652 --> 34:33.154
It's called the free fall.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.615
And this is, for me, the best part.

34:37.533 --> 34:39.452
It feels like you are flying.

34:43.289 --> 34:46.709
The silence, it's unique.

34:47.960 --> 34:51.172
It's like being
in the last quiet place on the Earth.

40:59.999 --> 41:01.333
Safety, keep your distances.

42:02.436 --> 42:03.812
Come on, Alexey.

42:05.564 --> 42:07.233
3'30, it's a very long dive time.

42:09.318 --> 42:11.278
Andrea, you go down as well.

42:18.619 --> 42:19.828
-Trouble.
-Yeah.

44:18.739 --> 44:20.407
We're on
day three of training.

44:20.491 --> 44:23.702
I'm really pleased, because
I've already beaten my personal best.

44:23.786 --> 44:25.204
I've done 88 meters.

44:40.928 --> 44:42.096
Excellent dive.

44:51.230 --> 44:53.941
Can I have a message
regarding the competition?

44:54.024 --> 44:56.652
This time,
I'm going to get the world record.

44:56.735 --> 44:57.903
Thank you.

45:12.292 --> 45:14.753
When I dive,

45:14.837 --> 45:20.134
I often imagine myself swimming…

45:21.260 --> 45:23.095
like a whale or dolphin.

45:36.859 --> 45:38.944
Alessia Zecchini
was extraordinary.

45:40.195 --> 45:43.323
Her dive was extremely elegant
in every respect.

46:10.267 --> 46:13.896
Ninety-four meters.

46:16.231 --> 46:18.358
- How many meters?
-Ninety-four.

46:18.442 --> 46:22.154
Wow. With Zecchini, we're not gonna stop.

47:21.839 --> 47:24.049
It was all too surreal.

47:26.385 --> 47:27.761
I was shocked.

47:29.805 --> 47:32.808
It was really sad
because she was so strong.

48:03.964 --> 48:05.924
After Natalia's accident,

48:06.717 --> 48:10.721
I began to realize
that it could be dangerous.

48:24.026 --> 48:26.194
I was going deeper and deeper.

48:31.450 --> 48:35.746
It's black. It's dark.
You feel locked inside.

48:39.458 --> 48:42.419
You can see things that don't exist.

48:46.632 --> 48:48.675
I was too scared.

48:49.927 --> 48:52.304
I wanted to turn around and go back.

49:07.110 --> 49:08.570
I didn't feel safe.

51:06.104 --> 51:10.067
For you, what is success in life?

51:10.817 --> 51:15.155
I suppose success is fulfilling
your aspirations, goals, dreams.

51:16.198 --> 51:19.659
I'm currently living in Egypt,
where I run a free diving center.

51:19.743 --> 51:22.913
I guess I'm happy in that respect.
I like what I do.

51:22.996 --> 51:26.166
Other parts of my life
are not so successful, I guess.

51:26.666 --> 51:32.422
Unfortunately, I'm a 38-year-old man,
and I don't have any kids.

51:32.506 --> 51:37.135
I suppose that's, people say,
something that I haven't quite fulfilled.

52:13.755 --> 52:16.216
Thank you. It's a major pleasure.

52:25.058 --> 52:26.560
Yeah, maybe, sure.

52:30.188 --> 52:35.360
We had no idea
she was after the world record.

52:37.070 --> 52:40.198
She doesn't like to worry us,
so she wouldn't tell us.

52:46.371 --> 52:48.039
I would like to go deeper.

52:50.167 --> 52:52.169
I would like to do the world record.

52:52.752 --> 52:54.045
That's my goal.

52:56.715 --> 52:57.757
Vertical Blue.

57:47.547 --> 57:49.549
Well done, Alexia.

57:49.632 --> 57:51.301
- Breathe.
- Breathe.

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:44.098
Why the hell
are you getting angry?

01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:46.142
You had a bad start. Chill out.

01:01:02.158 --> 01:01:03.868
Hello. I'm making this video

01:01:03.951 --> 01:01:06.287
to reassure everyone who cares about me
that I'm fine.

01:01:06.371 --> 01:01:11.125
And to disprove the rumors on Facebook
that I passed out at 20 meters.

01:01:11.959 --> 01:01:14.337
I had no problems with a lung squeeze.

01:01:15.046 --> 01:01:20.301
The dive overall went well,
and I ask you not to write lies.

01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:43.277
He inspired trust straightaway.

01:03:44.278 --> 01:03:48.199
I saw in him
the only one who could coach me.

01:04:08.719 --> 01:04:11.514
The thing
that struck me most were his eyes.

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:16.435
They were blue, so blue, like the sea.

01:04:19.564 --> 01:04:21.023
His gaze was enough.

01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:24.068
Before diving,
we would look at each other.

01:04:25.111 --> 01:04:27.029
And this gave me strength.

01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:33.494
Feeling his presence
made you feel safe in the darkness.

01:05:20.791 --> 01:05:25.212
There was a
relationship that went beyond free diving.

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:29.759
With some people,
you have an understanding.

01:05:29.842 --> 01:05:32.470
You don't need words or time.

01:05:36.724 --> 01:05:39.310
I saw this connection.

01:06:15.096 --> 01:06:21.310
Your biggest opponents
for breaking the record are the Japanese.

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:23.354
Do you fear them?

01:06:23.437 --> 01:06:25.773
I certainly fear my Japanese opponents.

01:06:28.734 --> 01:06:32.279
One hundred meters.
It was a big number.

01:06:33.447 --> 01:06:35.533
A Japanese record.

01:06:36.242 --> 01:06:37.660
And I was nervous.

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:44.834
And Stephen came and he grabbed me
by the shoulders in a very serious way.

01:06:45.876 --> 01:06:50.381
I remember him saying,
"It's going to be okay. I've got you."

01:08:33.526 --> 01:08:34.693
I'm okay.

01:09:25.369 --> 01:09:28.038
It was wonderful
to hug Steve after the dive.

01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:30.207
It was simply fantastic.

01:09:31.041 --> 01:09:33.085
Today, I'm so happy.

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:35.671
I achieved the dream I've had for so long.

01:09:49.101 --> 01:09:51.312
- Hi.
-Hi, Ale. Are you happy?

01:09:51.395 --> 01:09:52.438
So happy!

01:09:52.521 --> 01:09:55.357
-You were great, you know that?
-Yes, I know.

01:09:55.441 --> 01:09:57.067
What are you thinking now?

01:09:57.151 --> 01:09:59.862
I'm really happy.
I kick ass at Vertical Blue.

01:10:01.197 --> 01:10:05.367
Once you start touching…

01:10:07.369 --> 01:10:08.871
world records,

01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:11.707
you raise the bar so high.

01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:17.421
That's when things get worrying.

01:11:30.494 --> 01:11:32.538
You've talked about limits.

01:11:32.621 --> 01:11:34.707
What is Alessia Zecchini's limit?

01:11:35.666 --> 01:11:37.876
I don't think a limit exists.

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:41.005
It doesn't exist until I choose to quit.

01:13:41.458 --> 01:13:45.462
World record, 103 clean.
Fantastic.

01:14:44.229 --> 01:14:47.774
On streaming,
you can see the whole event.

01:14:56.617 --> 01:14:58.869
As you see her go down…

01:15:01.038 --> 01:15:03.707
you get a flood of worries.

01:15:30.817 --> 01:15:34.029
The sonar allows them to see

01:15:34.112 --> 01:15:35.614
whether they've stopped.

01:16:20.576 --> 01:16:23.704
We should see her coming out by now.

01:17:58.256 --> 01:17:59.549
There she is!

01:17:59.633 --> 01:18:03.220
She's no longer swallowed
by endless darkness.

01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:49.766
I got the new world record
of 104 meters, and I'm so happy.

01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:53.145
Thanks to all. Fantastic!
That's enough for now. Ciao!

01:19:29.556 --> 01:19:32.350
Give a round of applause
for Alessia Zecchini!

01:19:33.393 --> 01:19:34.686
-Hi, Alessia.
-Hi.

01:19:35.312 --> 01:19:37.063
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

01:19:37.147 --> 01:19:41.026
Beautiful, talented, young.
You've got it all.

01:19:41.109 --> 01:19:45.071
So, nine world championship gold medals,
four silver,

01:19:45.155 --> 01:19:46.698
one bronze.

01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:52.746
The ultimate record, the most famous one,
the one you are proudest of,

01:19:52.829 --> 01:19:56.708
so much so, you put it around your neck,

01:19:56.792 --> 01:19:59.252
the 104-meter world record.

01:20:01.004 --> 01:20:03.423
Any other ambitions, aims, goals?

01:21:23.587 --> 01:21:26.715
Stephen told us he was going
to pick Alessia up at the airport.

01:21:26.798 --> 01:21:28.091
"Look what I made."

01:21:28.174 --> 01:21:29.759
He pulled out

01:21:29.843 --> 01:21:34.347
an airport sign
with "Alessia" written on it.

01:21:35.765 --> 01:21:39.060
He was really excited, really happy.

01:21:39.644 --> 01:21:43.023
He wanted everything to be perfect
for Alessia's arrival.

01:21:47.402 --> 01:21:49.571
I haven't told you where we are yet.

01:21:49.654 --> 01:21:51.197
I'm in Dahab for training.

01:21:51.281 --> 01:21:53.867
It's beautiful here.

01:21:54.868 --> 01:21:56.411
Okay, everything is ready.

01:21:56.494 --> 01:21:59.372
We're here at the diving center,
packing everything.

01:21:59.456 --> 01:22:03.668
Then we'll head to the sea.
I'll show you the Blue Hole.

01:22:05.211 --> 01:22:08.131
He seemed
more excited than I was.

01:22:08.798 --> 01:22:11.426
And I found that quite endearing.

01:22:43.833 --> 01:22:45.502
Okay, Alessia. On your feet.

01:24:18.428 --> 01:24:20.764
He adored being in the desert.

01:24:23.808 --> 01:24:26.770
The happiness we shared was amazing.

01:25:06.434 --> 01:25:10.271
We were all together
that evening. It was our last night.

01:25:10.355 --> 01:25:14.442
And I remember
he turned to Alessia and said,

01:25:14.526 --> 01:25:18.988
"You'll be the first woman
to do the Arch after Natalia Molchanova."

01:25:20.448 --> 01:25:22.492
We told Stephen,

01:25:22.575 --> 01:25:24.285
"Look after Alessia."

01:25:26.204 --> 01:25:29.082
And obviously, as a safety, he told me…

01:25:34.170 --> 01:25:35.463
"Leave it with me."

01:25:48.476 --> 01:25:54.149
We're discussing the dive
before getting in the water.

01:25:54.232 --> 01:25:58.027
This is my coach, Steve,
and these are some other athletes.

01:25:58.111 --> 01:26:00.113
We'll get in the water soon.

01:26:01.239 --> 01:26:02.949
I'm preparing all the gear.

01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:05.869
We're ready to get in the water.

01:35:44.947 --> 01:35:49.994
The first meters,
everything seemed normal.

01:35:54.331 --> 01:35:55.833
Until I reached the Arch.

01:35:57.460 --> 01:36:01.589
I remember while I was swimming,
I felt it was a bit strenuous.

01:36:18.397 --> 01:36:19.815
There was a problem.

01:36:22.818 --> 01:36:25.112
Steve wasn't there,
but neither was the rope.

01:36:32.745 --> 01:36:35.664
I just tried to follow the reef,

01:36:35.748 --> 01:36:39.668
trying to see where the rope was.

01:36:40.377 --> 01:36:43.547
But I realized I couldn't find it.

01:36:45.758 --> 01:36:47.218
I'd made a mistake.

01:37:04.193 --> 01:37:06.320
I suddenly saw Steve in front of me.

01:37:07.029 --> 01:37:08.781
I remember he took my hands.

01:37:10.449 --> 01:37:13.118
And he swam, bringing me to the surface.

01:37:27.508 --> 01:37:30.469
I don't remember
the first seconds when I surfaced.

01:37:30.553 --> 01:37:32.388
I only remember, after a while,

01:37:32.471 --> 01:37:34.849
looking around
and not understanding a thing.

01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:06.839
Maybe I could have done more.

01:38:07.882 --> 01:38:11.093
If I had been more conscious,
I don't know.

01:38:40.414 --> 01:38:43.542
The worst thing is
we couldn't do anything.

01:38:43.626 --> 01:38:46.128
We couldn't save him.

01:38:46.211 --> 01:38:49.381
He rescued me, but I couldn't rescue him.

01:39:03.687 --> 01:39:06.565
He was a hero,
and he showed it till the end.

01:40:34.653 --> 01:40:36.363
I would give my life.

01:40:42.786 --> 01:40:44.246
Mine instead of his.

01:41:27.956 --> 01:41:32.169
Everybody,
we'll just dive until we feel

01:41:33.045 --> 01:41:34.880
we want to release our flowers

01:41:34.963 --> 01:41:38.383
and give thanks
for such a wonderful human in our lives,

01:41:39.384 --> 01:41:41.261
sending all the good energy

01:41:41.887 --> 01:41:44.056
that Stephen gave to all of us.

01:43:54.811 --> 01:43:57.272
He will always be with me.

01:43:59.733 --> 01:44:01.360
I remember his eyes…

01:44:03.445 --> 01:44:06.073
and try to remember
all the things he'd tell me.

01:44:10.494 --> 01:44:12.788
To live, to be happy.

01:44:16.625 --> 01:44:18.001
To believe in myself.

01:44:29.012 --> 01:44:31.515
I try and remember his hugs.

01:44:33.517 --> 01:44:38.689
He's the person who made me realize
what it really means to hug someone.

01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:45.320
From the hug, you'd understand
how deeply he cared about you

01:44:45.404 --> 01:44:48.240
and all the feelings
you could share together.

01:44:53.537 --> 01:44:54.913
He gave his life

01:44:56.290 --> 01:44:57.332
for Alessia.

01:45:00.085 --> 01:45:02.587
A pain like this stays with you.

01:45:05.007 --> 01:45:06.883
You go on.

01:45:08.385 --> 01:45:12.097
But that wound is there,
and it won't heal.

01:45:19.146 --> 01:45:21.064
He will always be in my heart.

01:45:25.402 --> 01:45:27.029
He's going to be with me forever,

01:45:27.112 --> 01:45:30.991
because I want him to stay with me
for the rest of my life.
