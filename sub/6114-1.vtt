00:41.960 --> 00:44.327
<i>Waking up in the light</i>

00:44.400 --> 00:46.319
<i>Of a shiny new day</i>

00:46.320 --> 00:50.803
<i>Giving thanks to the moon</i>
<i>for guiding my way</i>

00:50.880 --> 00:54.282
<i>There is no greater gift to the soul</i>

00:54.440 --> 00:58.764
<i>Than each breath</i>
<i>that my body can hold</i>

00:58.920 --> 01:02.163
<i>So, great spirits</i>

01:02.320 --> 01:06.723
<i>Hear my voice today</i>

01:09.240 --> 01:13.165
<i>Welcome, magic</i>

01:13.240 --> 01:17.848
<i>Welcome, sweet sun ray</i>

01:17.920 --> 01:20.002
<i>Love is no secret</i>

01:20.280 --> 01:21.930
<i>Look all around you</i>

01:22.000 --> 01:26.688
<i>Welcome to this day</i>

01:30.040 --> 01:31.485
Whoa!

01:31.560 --> 01:33.399
Look out! She's after us, eh!

01:33.400 --> 01:34.999
- Oh, jeez.
- You gotta help us!

01:35.000 --> 01:37.571
- You gotta hide us, eh.
- Oh, jeez. Too late. Here she comes!

01:46.200 --> 01:48.359
I told you that was no moosette.

01:48.360 --> 01:50.010
Well, she looked like one from behind.

01:50.560 --> 01:51.891
What's gotten into you two?

01:51.960 --> 01:54.879
- Well, it's that time of year, eh.
- Spring fever.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.211
Spring what?

01:56.360 --> 01:59.045
- Yeah, you know, like the birds.
- Yeah, and the bees.

01:59.120 --> 02:02.488
And the moosettes. If you know what
we mean by moosettes.

02:02.760 --> 02:06.759
Yeah, well, don't look now,
but your girlfriend's back.

02:06.760 --> 02:09.729
<i>Look all around you</i>

02:09.800 --> 02:12.565
<i>Welcome, magic</i>

02:12.720 --> 02:16.884
<i>Welcome, sweet sun ray</i>

02:17.040 --> 02:19.611
<i>Love is no secret</i>

02:19.760 --> 02:21.759
<i>Look all around you</i>

02:21.760 --> 02:25.685
<i>Welcome to this day</i>

02:25.920 --> 02:29.599
Awesome! Let's do it again.

02:30.840 --> 02:32.080
Hey, Kenai.

02:32.280 --> 02:34.886
- Hiya, Tug.
- Where y'all off to in such a hurry?

02:35.080 --> 02:36.599
Crowberry Ridge.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.090
We're gonna get dibs.

02:38.240 --> 02:40.447
There's elderberries,
salmonberries, raspberries,

02:40.600 --> 02:43.729
whortleberries, strawberries,
huckleberries, crowberries...

02:43.880 --> 02:46.690
Hey, hey, slow down now.
That's a lot of berries.

02:46.840 --> 02:48.922
Yeah, there's plenty.
You wanna come with us?

02:49.000 --> 02:51.890
Yoo-hoo! Tug!

02:51.960 --> 02:56.919
Well, I'd love to, little Koda,
but can't keep the girls waiting.

02:56.920 --> 02:58.604
Aw, who needs girls?

02:58.680 --> 03:00.842
We're two footloose guys out on the tundra.

03:01.600 --> 03:04.599
That's right. Kenai and Koda.
We don't need anybody else.

03:04.600 --> 03:08.047
Okay, but you can't run from love.

03:08.200 --> 03:09.361
Tug!

03:09.520 --> 03:11.682
It has a way of tracking you down.

03:11.920 --> 03:16.482
Hi, Hoonah.
You look mighty lovely today.

03:20.080 --> 03:22.606
Did you see the look on Tug's face?

03:22.800 --> 03:25.167
"Can't keep the girls waiting."

03:25.640 --> 03:27.290
All right. How about we get some rest?

03:27.360 --> 03:30.330
Rest? We've been hibernating
for six months.

03:30.520 --> 03:32.329
- Who needs rest?
- Who needs rest?

03:32.440 --> 03:36.126
A couple bears who are gonna beat all
the other bears to Crowberry Ridge.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.687
And we're gonna get first dibs
on the berries, right?

03:38.688 --> 03:39.920
Yeah, you bet.

03:40.880 --> 03:43.804
- If you promise to go to sleep.
- Okay, okay.

03:46.960 --> 03:51.124
I know all bears like berries,
but I love berries.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.525
Good night, Koda.

03:55.720 --> 03:58.200
Are you a berry-liker or a berry-lover?

03:58.360 --> 04:00.647
Good night, Koda.

04:12.640 --> 04:13.687
Nita!

04:13.960 --> 04:15.200
Kenai!

04:15.840 --> 04:18.161
Whoo! Yeah!

04:25.680 --> 04:27.808
- Race you to Hokani Falls!
- Wait up!

04:31.360 --> 04:32.850
Here I come!

04:40.280 --> 04:41.327
Nita!

05:13.360 --> 05:14.725
Here.

05:23.320 --> 05:26.403
We're always gonna be best friends, huh?

05:31.680 --> 05:32.761
Huh?

05:39.200 --> 05:40.770
Wow.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.482
Nita, time to go!

05:58.560 --> 06:00.130
Goodbye, Kenai.

06:04.120 --> 06:05.690
See you!

06:10.040 --> 06:11.769
Bye, Nita!

06:15.560 --> 06:17.130
Bye, Nita.

06:18.800 --> 06:21.007
Bye, Nita. Uh?

06:24.720 --> 06:25.881
So, who's Nita?

06:26.960 --> 06:28.086
Huh? What?

06:28.240 --> 06:32.529
Did you know you talk in your sleep?
You were going, "Nita! Nita!"

06:33.400 --> 06:34.765
So who's Nita?

06:35.640 --> 06:39.326
She's a girl I used to know.

06:39.640 --> 06:41.369
Whatever happened to her?

06:41.640 --> 06:44.723
I don't know. I guess she grew up.

06:51.400 --> 06:52.686
He's here! He's here!

06:53.160 --> 06:55.481
- The groom is here!
- We must hurry. Let us prepare.

06:55.680 --> 06:58.684
Hurry up! I wanna see him.
I wanna see Atka.

06:58.840 --> 07:00.569
Nita, he's here!

07:01.160 --> 07:03.162
They're here.
Prepare for the ceremonies.

07:03.320 --> 07:05.846
He must have brought
his entire village with him.

07:06.200 --> 07:09.399
Well, my sweet, this marriage
is extremely important.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.679
That's why we came to help you get ready.

07:11.680 --> 07:14.923
Oh, no, no. That's okay.
I can get myself ready.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.601
Ah, go ahead. Use all the water.

07:17.680 --> 07:19.091
Then we'll just air dry your hair.

07:19.092 --> 07:22.050
Air dry? Certainly not.
Towel dry is shinier.

07:22.520 --> 07:23.567
You know...

07:23.640 --> 07:26.291
We'll put your hair up
to show off your beautiful eyes.

07:26.480 --> 07:30.530
Up? No, down, of course,
to frame that beautiful face.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.568
No, we're gonna put it up to show it off better.

07:32.680 --> 07:34.728
- Down.
- Up.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.290
- I'm gonna say down.
- Uh...

07:36.520 --> 07:38.568
Oh, she's nervous. She needs to eat.

07:38.720 --> 07:40.165
- I'll go get some smoked salmon.
- But I...

07:40.280 --> 07:41.930
Salmon? On a nervous stomach?

07:42.160 --> 07:44.640
She needs hackberry root steeped in rainwater.

07:44.720 --> 07:45.767
In the morning? No!

07:45.840 --> 07:47.569
No, no, I'm fine.

07:47.720 --> 07:49.688
I think I'll feel better when I'm dressed.

07:49.800 --> 07:52.326
Dressed?
I have just the outfit for you.

07:52.560 --> 07:55.803
Oh, but you don't understand.
I already have one picked out.

07:55.880 --> 07:58.281
Simple reindeer hide.
Slimming, yet elegant.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.439
No, caribou. Feathers. Lots of beads.

08:00.440 --> 08:02.363
- Beads? Are you nuts?
- Reindeer for a wedding?

08:02.560 --> 08:04.085
- No more beads.
- Seashells, then.

08:04.240 --> 08:07.239
- What is it with you and your seashells?
- I love seashells!

08:07.240 --> 08:08.287
Hey!

08:09.880 --> 08:12.042
I do believe I am feeling a bit hungry.

08:12.720 --> 08:14.245
- I'll get the salmon.
- I'll get the tea.

08:14.320 --> 08:16.209
Okay. Get plenty of both.

08:35.840 --> 08:40.687
You look as beautiful in that dress
as your mother did on our wedding day.

08:41.720 --> 08:43.279
Thanks, Daddy.

08:43.280 --> 08:45.681
I wanted to wear something of hers today.

08:46.480 --> 08:51.441
Oh, that means so much to me.
Your mother would be so proud.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.964
I wish she was here.

08:56.480 --> 08:58.209
Oh, she is.

08:59.120 --> 09:00.770
In here.

09:01.640 --> 09:06.851
Once you love someone,
they stay in your heart forever.

09:12.360 --> 09:14.408
Are you ready to meet Atka?

09:25.360 --> 09:26.691
Psst.

09:27.160 --> 09:28.366
- Hmm?
- Mmm-hmm.

09:43.880 --> 09:47.521
Great spirits, we come before you today

09:47.800 --> 09:50.963
to bond this man and this woman as one.

09:52.040 --> 09:54.361
We pray this pleases you.

10:13.920 --> 10:15.001
Watch out!

10:19.880 --> 10:21.041
Nita!

10:33.840 --> 10:35.763
The spirits are trying to tell us something.

10:35.764 --> 10:37.728
It must be a sign.

10:49.840 --> 10:53.279
I don't understand.
How could this happen?

10:53.280 --> 10:54.930
The villagers say it's a sign.

10:55.040 --> 10:57.407
The villagers?
What the heck do they know?

10:57.520 --> 11:00.285
Do you want the advice
of the villagers or a professional?

11:00.440 --> 11:02.799
Oh, no, definitely a professional.

11:02.800 --> 11:07.169
They say that in all the tribes,
you are the wisest shaman.

11:07.240 --> 11:09.766
Sha-woman, okay?

11:10.080 --> 11:12.606
"Wise" and "man" don't even belong
in the same sentence.

11:12.920 --> 11:14.285
Let's get down to business.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.448
So the ice cracked right out from under you.

11:16.760 --> 11:19.889
Sure you haven't put on a few pounds?
Come on, girl to girl.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.447
No, my weight's been constant.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.007
Well, lucky you, Miss Constant Weight.

11:25.440 --> 11:28.887
Tell you what.
Why don't we just ask the spirits, okay?

11:31.440 --> 11:33.363
Hmm.

11:33.640 --> 11:35.210
Uh-huh. Yeah.

11:35.280 --> 11:36.770
What? What are they saying?

11:36.771 --> 11:38.842
Don't interrupt. It ain't all about you.

11:39.120 --> 11:40.167
Uh-huh.

11:40.240 --> 11:41.651
They say...

11:42.400 --> 11:44.323
You can't marry Ka-ka!

11:44.440 --> 11:45.680
- Atka.
- Whatever.

11:45.800 --> 11:49.282
The point is, you're already
matched up, Miss Two Timer.

11:49.400 --> 11:52.290
Already matched up?
To whom?

11:52.640 --> 11:54.085
To the one who gave you this.

11:55.760 --> 11:58.331
Look at that picture.
That thing is crystal clear.

11:59.880 --> 12:00.881
Kenai?

12:01.040 --> 12:02.326
The bear boy?

12:02.440 --> 12:05.762
Oh, no, no. We were just kids.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.410
I've heard that one before.

12:07.640 --> 12:10.211
Oh, there has to be a way to undo this.

12:10.360 --> 12:14.001
Undo it?
You can't undo what's been done.

12:14.080 --> 12:17.846
It's done. Case closed.
No more conversation. Ooh!

12:18.560 --> 12:19.846
There is one way.

12:21.200 --> 12:26.001
You must go and eat an ox!

12:26.080 --> 12:27.127
What?

12:27.200 --> 12:28.645
Oh, wait, I'm sorry.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.129
It's the equinox!

12:32.000 --> 12:34.082
Does this place mean anything to you?

12:34.840 --> 12:36.524
Hokani Falls?

12:38.360 --> 12:40.681
That's where Kenai gave me the amulet.

12:41.440 --> 12:43.169
You gotta go to Hokani Falls.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.407
And on the eve of the equinox,

12:46.480 --> 12:49.245
when the spirits change winter into spring,

12:49.680 --> 12:51.842
you must burn the amulet

12:51.920 --> 12:55.845
and send the bond back up to the ancestors!

12:57.080 --> 12:58.764
You know, you might wanna
write some of this down.

13:00.320 --> 13:03.563
The equinox is only three days away.
I have to get going.

13:03.760 --> 13:06.730
Uh, with the person who gave you the amulet.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.371
Kenai? But he's a bear.

13:11.320 --> 13:12.367
Yeah?

13:13.120 --> 13:15.327
You know, a bear?

13:16.760 --> 13:20.890
Uh, I know what a bear is,
and I suggest you go look in the woods.

13:22.200 --> 13:25.170
Well, even if I find him,
how will I talk to him?

13:25.560 --> 13:28.040
Hmm. How will you talk to him?

13:38.200 --> 13:40.089
Don't be afraid. It's in there.

13:42.360 --> 13:44.249
That ain't it. Come on, try it again.

13:45.760 --> 13:47.922
Ooh! I don't know what that was.
One more time.

13:55.080 --> 13:58.482
And that mammoth stood there
watching the whole thing.

13:58.560 --> 14:00.961
So I told Bucky, "The next time
you have to sneeze,

14:01.040 --> 14:03.599
"please take the walnuts
out of your mouth first."

14:03.600 --> 14:06.919
Oh, and then I started laughing so hard,
guess what came out of my nose.

14:06.920 --> 14:10.003
Uh, Koda, speaking of food...

14:10.080 --> 14:14.165
I know what you mean. All this walking
has made me crazy hungry.

14:14.240 --> 14:16.925
Ha-ha!

14:17.040 --> 14:18.279
Hey, watch it.

14:20.440 --> 14:22.119
Hey! Whoa!

14:22.120 --> 14:23.451
All right, step aside, kid,

14:23.440 --> 14:25.522
and let a real bear show you
how the digging's done.

14:26.320 --> 14:29.324
Sure it's easy now.
I gave you a head start.

14:30.040 --> 14:32.805
Jackpot. All the roots
you can eat, buddy.

14:33.280 --> 14:34.999
I knew I was onto something.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.331
Oh, yeah, you did, huh?

14:36.560 --> 14:39.839
Ah, what can I say?
I've got killer instincts.

14:39.840 --> 14:41.171
Yeah, right.

14:43.560 --> 14:45.324
Oh, hey, look, is this a tuber?

14:45.400 --> 14:47.368
- Get down!
- What is it?

15:04.320 --> 15:06.163
Quick, hide in here!

15:39.440 --> 15:40.521
Aah!

15:48.680 --> 15:49.761
Ahh!

15:52.480 --> 15:53.561
Nita?

15:53.680 --> 15:55.205
Ow!

15:55.280 --> 15:56.520
Watch it!

15:56.640 --> 15:59.644
Hey, no, Nita! It's me, Kenai.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.371
Kenai?

16:05.800 --> 16:07.086
Is it really you?

16:07.160 --> 16:08.889
Yeah, it's really me.

16:09.720 --> 16:12.291
Wow, I'd heard you were a bear,

16:12.360 --> 16:16.410
I just didn't realise
you'd look so much like a bear.

16:16.480 --> 16:19.927
Yeah, well, look at you.
You really changed.

16:20.320 --> 16:24.006
Wait a minute. You can talk.
I mean, you can understand me?

16:24.240 --> 16:28.529
Yeah. The spirits did it
so when I found you, I could talk to you.

16:28.640 --> 16:32.565
Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. You...
You've been looking for me? Why?

16:32.920 --> 16:35.207
Well, this is why.

16:36.400 --> 16:39.927
You've kept this? After all these years.

16:40.320 --> 16:44.291
The great spirits told our shaman
that this amulet bonds us as one.

16:44.360 --> 16:45.486
Really?

16:45.560 --> 16:47.722
So now you and I have to go to Hokani Falls...

16:47.800 --> 16:49.086
Together? Like when we were kids?

16:49.160 --> 16:50.605
- ...and burn it.
- And burn it!

16:50.720 --> 16:52.131
Burn it? What?

16:52.640 --> 16:54.961
It's no big deal. It's only a little trinket.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.644
Little trinket?

16:56.760 --> 16:59.331
Uh, well, what I mean is,
we were just silly kids.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.690
They won't let me get married
until it's destroyed.

17:03.880 --> 17:05.803
Hmm. Let me think about this.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.450
- Sorry, can't help you.
- What?

17:08.560 --> 17:12.007
So, have fun burning
the silly little trinket on your own.

17:12.079 --> 17:13.799
No, you don't understand.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.999
We have to burn it together.
Otherwise, it won't work.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.126
What won't work?

17:19.960 --> 17:22.849
Uh, Nita, this is my brother, Koda.
Koda, Nita. Nita, Koda.

17:22.920 --> 17:26.288
So you're Nita.
Kenai was just dreaming about you.

17:27.599 --> 17:29.682
I was not.

17:29.800 --> 17:33.679
Was too.
You should hear him. "Nita. Nita."

17:33.680 --> 17:35.648
Well, it's been nice talking to you,

17:35.720 --> 17:39.359
but Koda and I have big plans
to go to Crowberry Ridge.

17:39.360 --> 17:41.359
Wait! You're just gonna walk away?

17:41.360 --> 17:43.328
You're not gonna help me take care of this?

17:43.329 --> 17:44.367
Nope.

17:44.440 --> 17:47.808
You know, neither of us can get on
with our lives until we burn this amulet.

17:47.920 --> 17:49.490
I'll take my chances.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.646
Okay. Fine. Fine.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.082
I guess I'll just wait for them
to turn you back into a human

17:56.160 --> 17:58.288
and send you to find me.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.684
Would they do that?

18:02.800 --> 18:05.041
No. No, buddy, of course not.

18:05.120 --> 18:07.327
Well, how do you know?

18:08.600 --> 18:11.046
What if they did turn you back into a man?

18:12.280 --> 18:14.362
Then we wouldn't be brothers any more.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.682
No, Koda, it's... That's not...

18:17.320 --> 18:18.321
Hmm.

18:20.680 --> 18:25.208
Fine. Okay.
We'll go to Hokani Falls.

18:26.360 --> 18:29.079
But right after that, buddy, just the two of us,

18:29.080 --> 18:30.969
we'll race down to Crowberry Ridge.

18:31.040 --> 18:33.520
- Pinkie swear?
- Pinkie swear.

18:34.520 --> 18:36.488
Then it's settled. Ready?

18:36.880 --> 18:39.087
As I'll ever be.

18:39.800 --> 18:40.926
Um...

18:41.000 --> 18:43.239
Hokani Falls is this way.

18:43.240 --> 18:45.199
I knew that. I knew that.

18:45.200 --> 18:48.204
No, he didn't.
Kenai has a lousy sense of direction.

18:48.280 --> 18:49.281
That is not true.

18:49.360 --> 18:50.725
One time, in the middle of the night,

18:50.726 --> 18:52.290
he was trying to find our cave in the dark...

18:55.560 --> 18:59.849
Course, when we met, he didn't know
the first thing about being a bear.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.242
Like this one time,
we were hunting for pine nuts,

19:02.320 --> 19:05.164
and he stuck his big head inside a hollow tree.

19:05.680 --> 19:09.366
And I said, "You better not do that
'cause you don't know who lives there."

19:09.880 --> 19:12.439
But he did, 'cause you can't tell Kenai nothing.

19:12.440 --> 19:13.601
All right, Koda.

19:13.602 --> 19:17.685
Next thing you know, he spent a whole
week smelling like a stinky skunk.

19:17.920 --> 19:21.599
Something tells me
stinky skunk was an improvement.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.763
I got a lot more stinky Kenai
stories, if you want to hear them.

19:24.840 --> 19:27.491
- Okay, so, like, we gotta go, eh.
- We'll see you around, eh.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.279
- So, we'll give you a call.
- Yeah, we'll catch you later.

19:30.280 --> 19:32.439
Yeah, we gotta go work out.

19:32.440 --> 19:34.761
Yeah. Gotta keep
these muscles real buff, eh.

19:34.840 --> 19:35.919
So long!

19:35.920 --> 19:38.002
- Hey, look, it's big bear.
- Beauty, eh.

19:38.080 --> 19:40.481
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Boy, are we glad to see you, eh.

19:40.482 --> 19:43.529
Yeah, 'cause we finally found a couple
of real moosettes, eh,

19:43.600 --> 19:45.284
right down there by the stream.

19:45.360 --> 19:46.600
Bye!

19:46.840 --> 19:48.524
- Toodle-oo!
- So long!

19:48.920 --> 19:50.160
Those guys are weird.

19:50.240 --> 19:52.971
Don't look. You'll only encourage them.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.849
But they won't give us the time of day, eh.

19:57.920 --> 20:01.720
We was thinking maybe you could help
us with, you know, an opening line, like,

20:01.800 --> 20:04.119
"Oh, hey, I see you like to eat twigs."

20:04.120 --> 20:06.119
Or how about a sonnet, eh?

20:06.120 --> 20:08.805
Like, "Shall I compare thee
to a summer's dew?"

20:08.920 --> 20:12.163
Oh, jeez. Forget that brainy stuff, eh.
They're not owls.

20:12.280 --> 20:15.799
I like, "Hey ladies, nice dewlaps.
Are those things real?"

20:15.800 --> 20:16.926
Excuse me.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.644
- Uh-oh. Oh, gee.
- Hunter. Hunter!

20:19.645 --> 20:22.120
We're out of here! Bye!
Every moose for himself.

20:22.240 --> 20:23.999
Oh!

20:24.000 --> 20:25.411
Act like we're not here.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.490
It's okay. This is Nita.
She's with me and Kenai.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.641
- She is?
- Oh.

20:29.642 --> 20:31.688
- Well, pleased to meet you, eh.
- How's it going, eh?

20:31.760 --> 20:33.171
I'm Rutt, and this is my brother...

20:33.160 --> 20:34.241
Kenai, what's the holdup?

20:34.320 --> 20:37.244
We have to set up camp
on that far peak before sundown.

20:37.640 --> 20:38.846
Oh, nice to meet you.

20:39.160 --> 20:40.639
Scary, isn't she?

20:40.640 --> 20:42.879
Let's go. We're running out of daylight.

20:42.880 --> 20:46.043
Nita, calm down. We got plenty of time.

20:46.120 --> 20:49.479
A smart traveller always allows
for unexpected delays.

20:49.480 --> 20:52.324
Well, this won't be a delay
if you let me have a minute

20:52.520 --> 20:55.603
to give these guys a little romantic advice.

20:58.920 --> 21:01.321
Romantic advice? From you?

21:01.920 --> 21:03.684
Stop kidding. Let's go.

21:06.920 --> 21:12.324
Hmm. You know, boys, I think this calls
for more than just a good opening line.

21:12.800 --> 21:13.847
It does?

21:14.200 --> 21:15.565
Oh, yeah, yeah, of course. Ahem.

21:15.566 --> 21:20.521
Acts of bravery.
That's what really impresses the ladies.

21:20.640 --> 21:23.041
Gee, eh, bravery sounds scary.

21:23.120 --> 21:25.361
No, you just have to pretend to be brave.

21:25.440 --> 21:28.364
- Yeah?
- I'll go out there, I'll act all ferocious,

21:29.000 --> 21:32.561
and then you guys come over
the beaver dam and rescue them.

21:32.640 --> 21:35.041
Oh. Okay. Yeah, yeah.
That's a beauty plan.

21:35.120 --> 21:37.199
- He's smart, eh. Not like you.
- Oh, get out.

21:37.200 --> 21:41.091
Kenai, we don't have time
for this. Kenai!

21:41.200 --> 21:42.770
It's no use.

21:42.840 --> 21:45.810
This falls under,
"You can't tell Kenai nothing."

21:52.800 --> 21:54.165
What's wrong with him?

21:54.240 --> 21:56.561
Maybe he got ahold of some bad salmon.

21:56.640 --> 21:59.041
This is stupid.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.968
This ought to impress the ladies for sure, eh.

22:02.969 --> 22:04.121
Yeah.

22:04.200 --> 22:09.331
I'm a big hungry bear,
and I'm gonna rip you to shreds! Roar!

22:12.000 --> 22:14.082
I said I'm gonna rip you to shreds!

22:15.840 --> 22:17.490
Uh-oh. Hey, I think that's our cue, eh.

22:17.480 --> 22:18.606
- Yeah, beauty.
- Let's go.

22:18.680 --> 22:20.439
Fear not, moosettes!

22:20.440 --> 22:23.125
I, Tuke, and my brother, Rutt,
will save you, eh.

22:23.200 --> 22:25.168
- Yeah!
- What ho, largish bear?

22:25.280 --> 22:27.806
Touch not those fair moosette ladies, eh.

22:27.880 --> 22:30.008
You's gonna have to go
through us if you want them.

22:30.080 --> 22:32.367
Yeah. You'll have to kill us, eh.

22:32.440 --> 22:35.439
- What? No, no, not kill us.
- Oh, sorry.

22:35.440 --> 22:39.684
Uh, maybe not kill us, but just,
you know, push us down or something.

22:40.480 --> 22:42.050
Roar!

22:50.600 --> 22:52.159
Jeez, that was scary, eh.

22:52.160 --> 22:54.003
Jeez. I thought
I was gonna wet my hooves.

22:54.080 --> 22:56.526
You can go back to grazing.
Nothing to see here.

22:56.680 --> 22:58.279
- Toodle-oo!
- Hey, wait!

22:58.280 --> 23:00.487
Guys, where are you going?
Don't leave.

23:12.400 --> 23:15.839
- This used to be such a quiet river, eh.
- Oh, yes.

23:15.840 --> 23:19.242
- Let's get out of here.
- Nice rack on that little one, though.

23:19.320 --> 23:21.846
Are you kidding?
All antler and no brain.

23:22.800 --> 23:24.325
That went well.

23:28.560 --> 23:29.846
Hey, Kenai.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.521
I thought you were supposed to be scaring moose.

23:32.840 --> 23:34.888
Do you think you can help me out here?

23:34.960 --> 23:37.361
Do all his plans end
with his head stuck in something?

23:37.362 --> 23:38.559
Most of them.

23:38.560 --> 23:40.164
- Koda!
- Well, they do.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.205
Calm down, Kenai.

23:43.400 --> 23:46.006
We'll try to get you out of here.

23:52.560 --> 23:54.801
Okay, let's see here.

23:55.280 --> 23:56.725
Aah! Ohh!

23:56.800 --> 23:59.485
Sure would be easier
if he didn't have such a fat head.

24:04.400 --> 24:06.209
- Hi, Kenai.
- Hi, Koda.

24:06.280 --> 24:08.931
Oh! Oh, no! My bag. My bag!
The amulet's in my bag!

24:09.360 --> 24:11.840
It's floating right in front of you.
Just grab it!

24:13.880 --> 24:15.723
Nita!

24:17.520 --> 24:19.682
You get it. I can't. I can't.

24:19.960 --> 24:22.167
It's right there! Kenai, get it.

24:22.360 --> 24:23.885
I'm a little busy here.

24:24.440 --> 24:26.602
It's getting away, Kenai!
Help! Get it! Get it!

24:26.680 --> 24:27.806
Stop hitting...

24:29.080 --> 24:30.161
Oh, no!

24:31.360 --> 24:34.682
Oh! The amulet. Oh, there it is!

24:42.400 --> 24:45.688
I guess this would qualify
as one of those unexpected delays.

24:45.760 --> 24:46.921
Ah, there it is.

24:49.200 --> 24:50.611
Oh, thank goodness.

24:54.080 --> 24:55.605
Let's see what we got here.

24:56.240 --> 24:58.083
Hey! Wait, that's my stuff.

24:59.320 --> 25:00.401
Ooh!

25:01.720 --> 25:04.087
You leave that alone. It's mine.

25:06.600 --> 25:09.171
Ugh! Come on!

25:17.440 --> 25:18.851
It's gone.

25:19.120 --> 25:21.771
Ohh! The amulet is gone.

25:21.920 --> 25:25.367
That's because there ain't a better thief
than the masked bandit.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.124
Once they get something in their clutches,

25:27.200 --> 25:29.202
you might as well give up all hope.

25:29.360 --> 25:31.886
Nope, that amulet's as good as gone.

25:31.960 --> 25:33.928
The Ice Age will end before you get it back.

25:34.600 --> 25:35.959
Thanks a lot, Kenai.

25:35.960 --> 25:37.803
- What did I do?
- This is all your fault!

25:37.804 --> 25:38.847
My fault?

25:38.920 --> 25:40.365
If you hadn't stopped to help those moose...

25:40.440 --> 25:43.279
Whoa, whoa! You're the one
who destroyed an entire beaver dam.

25:43.280 --> 25:46.363
I wouldn't have destroyed it if you
hadn't gotten your head stuck in it.

25:46.480 --> 25:49.643
And I'm not the one who had the bag
in reach and then let it float away.

25:49.720 --> 25:51.927
My head was stuck.
What's your excuse?

26:00.360 --> 26:02.169
Oh, what am I gonna do now?

26:02.440 --> 26:07.162
If I can't burn the amulet,
I'll never be able to marry Atka.

27:11.720 --> 27:12.879
Kenai?

27:12.880 --> 27:16.439
Nita, Nita, you gotta come quick.
You're not gonna believe it.

27:16.440 --> 27:18.966
Kenai spent the whole night
untangling those tracks.

27:19.080 --> 27:22.243
And I didn't think anybody could,
'cause they were all forks,

27:22.320 --> 27:24.129
double-backs and crisscrosses
and dead ends...

27:24.240 --> 27:26.208
Koda, Koda, where is Kenai?

27:26.280 --> 27:29.921
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
He found the river bandit's hideout.

27:30.200 --> 27:31.804
Show me.

27:39.400 --> 27:40.890
Nita, Nita, over here.

27:41.520 --> 27:42.806
Well, where is it? Did you get it?

27:43.320 --> 27:44.924
Shh! I don't have it yet.

27:44.925 --> 27:49.130
It's up in the tree.
I'm waiting for them to fall asleep.

27:51.200 --> 27:53.168
- Nita, wait.
- Hey!

27:54.600 --> 27:56.090
Nita, what are you doing?

27:56.360 --> 27:58.010
I'm getting my amulet back.

27:58.240 --> 27:59.571
Let me handle this.

27:59.640 --> 28:01.688
I'm fine. I've got it covered.

28:01.920 --> 28:03.365
No, seriously, you could fall.

28:04.480 --> 28:06.642
I'm trying to concentrate.

28:07.760 --> 28:08.921
Whoa!

28:12.560 --> 28:13.721
Hey, hey!

28:14.240 --> 28:17.767
Can't any of you morons
define the term "nocturnal"?

28:18.360 --> 28:19.521
Anyone?

28:19.800 --> 28:21.370
Sorry. Sorry.

28:21.480 --> 28:24.927
It's completely my fault. Just me.

28:25.440 --> 28:28.284
Uh, listen, you've got something of ours.

28:30.600 --> 28:33.809
Yeah, it's round, about so big.

28:35.280 --> 28:36.520
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

28:36.600 --> 28:38.409
That's for me to know and for you to find out.

28:38.480 --> 28:39.720
Either way, it's a moot point.

28:39.800 --> 28:42.246
Finders keepers, losers weepers.
It's the way of the woods.

28:42.360 --> 28:45.204
Hey, you didn't find it,
you stole it. Thief.

28:45.400 --> 28:47.721
All right, you got me. That's what we do.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.811
We rob from the rich
and give to the less fortunate.

28:50.880 --> 28:52.803
You know, like us.

28:58.640 --> 29:01.041
I don't think you wanna mess with Kenai.

29:01.120 --> 29:04.359
He's a lean, mean,
raccoon butt-kicking machine.

29:06.120 --> 29:08.088
Ow!

29:09.640 --> 29:11.449
- Ahh!
- Go ahead!

29:11.560 --> 29:13.879
Hit him with all you got. He can take it.

29:13.880 --> 29:15.325
Koda, what are you doing?

29:15.520 --> 29:18.000
I'm tricking them into using
all their pine cones.

29:18.320 --> 29:21.005
Ow! It's a pine forest.

29:21.080 --> 29:23.399
Oh, right. This could take a while.

29:23.400 --> 29:24.481
You think?

29:24.880 --> 29:27.559
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, what about a trade?

29:27.560 --> 29:31.451
Whoa, whoa! Hold your fire.
Hold it. Hold, hold. He wants to trade.

29:31.880 --> 29:35.089
- Ooh, a trade.
- Whatcha got?

29:35.480 --> 29:37.847
What do I got?
I got lots of things.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.890
I got pine cones?

29:41.240 --> 29:42.287
No!

29:43.120 --> 29:45.088
Uh, how about this stick?

29:45.160 --> 29:46.719
- No.
- Rock?

29:46.720 --> 29:48.131
You are insulting me.

29:48.200 --> 29:50.123
I can't believe it!

29:50.200 --> 29:52.851
Shoo. Shoo. Come on.

29:52.960 --> 29:55.008
Come on, let go.

30:00.640 --> 30:01.926
Ohh...

30:02.400 --> 30:03.845
Mama!

30:05.680 --> 30:06.919
Uh...

30:06.920 --> 30:08.001
Hi?

30:08.400 --> 30:11.006
Nita, I think it's time to go!

30:31.760 --> 30:33.091
Nita, behind you!

30:38.880 --> 30:40.609
Whoa! She's not bad.

30:46.320 --> 30:47.924
I got an idea. Come on.

30:49.280 --> 30:50.441
Nita, go to the top.

30:50.720 --> 30:53.200
What? I'm trying to get down.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.642
Just listen to me! I know what I'm doing.

30:55.800 --> 30:56.881
Hello!

30:57.800 --> 30:59.962
I want what you took from me.

31:02.280 --> 31:04.487
Yes, that's it. Keep going!

31:07.440 --> 31:08.601
Let's get her.

31:12.320 --> 31:13.685
Kenai!

31:14.240 --> 31:17.961
Well, well. Nowhere to run to, baby,
nowhere to hide.

31:19.600 --> 31:20.931
Nita, let go!

31:21.040 --> 31:22.963
What? This is your plan?

31:23.440 --> 31:24.487
Just trust me.

31:24.640 --> 31:25.846
Don't listen to him.

31:25.920 --> 31:28.685
Come on, be a smart little hunter girl, huh?

31:28.760 --> 31:30.683
Hand over the trinket.

31:33.160 --> 31:35.970
Kenai, this better work!

31:37.280 --> 31:38.327
Catch me!

31:58.120 --> 32:01.159
- That was a lot of raccoons.
- I can't believe I outran all of them.

32:01.160 --> 32:03.766
- When you jumped out of that tree...
- Oh, oh! And the way you caught me!

32:03.840 --> 32:05.046
And then when we fell...

32:05.047 --> 32:06.849
You were amazing!

32:10.160 --> 32:12.527
I'm just glad we finally got the old Nita back.

32:13.520 --> 32:15.409
What do you mean, "the old Nita"?

32:15.640 --> 32:17.210
The fun Nita.

32:17.280 --> 32:20.204
Come on, you know you've been
kind of a stick in the mud this entire trip.

32:22.440 --> 32:25.205
Okay, maybe you don't know.

32:25.320 --> 32:27.527
It's just good to see you
loosen up a bit, you know?

32:27.640 --> 32:29.210
Now hold on.

32:29.800 --> 32:32.280
Ew! What stinks?

32:32.360 --> 32:33.919
It's not me, Koda.

32:33.920 --> 32:37.925
Ugh! That's the most disgusting thing
I've ever smelled.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.047
Let's go check it out.

32:39.320 --> 32:43.245
Hey! Wait a minute! I'm not finished.

32:46.200 --> 32:49.204
Oh, brother, I have never known
a moose to take this long, eh.

32:49.320 --> 32:52.039
Don't rush me.
I can't do it while you're watching.

32:52.040 --> 32:54.327
- Jeez. You're getting it on my leg.
- Sorry.

32:54.400 --> 32:56.559
- Oh, hey, largish bear.
- How's it going, eh?

32:56.560 --> 32:58.562
- Are we glad to see you.
- Yeah, beauty.

32:58.640 --> 33:00.927
We're still getting the brush-off
from those moosettes.

33:01.040 --> 33:03.771
Yeah, they seem immune
to our rugged good looks, eh,

33:03.880 --> 33:06.439
so we thought we'd appeal
to their olfactory senses.

33:06.440 --> 33:07.487
Ew!

33:08.120 --> 33:09.281
Yes, for example,

33:09.360 --> 33:12.079
I'm wearing essence of wet leaf compost

33:12.080 --> 33:14.401
- with just a hint of sandalwood.
- Ugh!

33:14.480 --> 33:16.687
And I'm augmenting my natural moosely musk

33:16.760 --> 33:19.366
with a blend of pine needles and river mud.

33:19.600 --> 33:22.251
I got news for you, little brother.
That wasn't mud.

33:22.400 --> 33:23.686
- Ugh!
- Gee, eh.

33:23.760 --> 33:25.489
- Kind of overpowering?
- That's no good.

33:25.560 --> 33:27.961
Guys, don't sweat it. I got another plan.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.371
Oh, yeah.

33:29.800 --> 33:32.770
I think we've all seen
your expertise on romance.

33:33.800 --> 33:36.451
Yeah, very funny.
Don't we have an amulet to burn?

33:36.640 --> 33:38.768
Oh, we can spare a moment.

33:38.960 --> 33:41.611
- Beauty, eh.
- What you need here...

33:41.840 --> 33:42.887
Excuse me.

33:43.040 --> 33:45.327
Is a woman's point of view.

33:45.440 --> 33:48.330
- Yeah?
- And a plan that actually works.

33:49.160 --> 33:50.605
That's beauty, eh.

33:53.000 --> 33:57.608
Hi! I'm playing with my two best friends,
and I need a place to hide.

33:57.800 --> 33:59.484
Aw! Look at the sweet little thing.

33:59.485 --> 34:01.319
Jeez, I could just eat him up.

34:01.320 --> 34:02.446
Hello...

34:02.720 --> 34:06.327
- Psst. Go. Go. Get moving.
- Beauty, eh.

34:06.520 --> 34:07.679
Good luck, eh.

34:07.680 --> 34:10.286
- Rutt, would you get going?
- Okay.

34:10.400 --> 34:12.880
Oh, uh, excuse us, ladies.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.482
We're looking for our pal.

34:16.960 --> 34:18.643
- Um, brownish?
- Why, yes.

34:18.960 --> 34:20.246
- Furry?
- Yes, again.

34:20.360 --> 34:22.089
- About yay big?
- That's him!

34:22.199 --> 34:23.565
Haven't seen him.

34:24.480 --> 34:25.641
Ha! Here I am.

34:26.320 --> 34:27.400
I fooled you. I win.

34:27.480 --> 34:30.324
- There's no beating you, little buddy.
- Look at that.

34:30.639 --> 34:32.165
You're so good with him.

34:32.320 --> 34:35.164
Oh, yeah, eh. We have lots
of little kid animal friends.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.641
We know a little weasel and a little badger.

34:37.800 --> 34:40.724
And we've even got some
little baby bunny friends.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.159
Aw...

34:42.159 --> 34:45.039
Whoa. Smallish bear
is like a babe magnet, eh.

34:46.520 --> 34:47.601
Socialise.

34:47.679 --> 34:51.321
So, would you ladies
be interested in grazing on some twigs?

34:51.560 --> 34:53.722
Oh, no, thanks, we just ate. Ow!

34:54.199 --> 34:55.360
We love twigs.

34:55.520 --> 34:57.522
Really? Well, so do we.
Right, little brother?

34:58.480 --> 35:00.369
Shall I compare thee to a summer's dew?

35:00.370 --> 35:01.407
Oh, jeez.

35:01.480 --> 35:05.201
Though it art more lovely
and more dewy than you.

35:05.400 --> 35:07.528
- Oh, nice move, eh.
- What's wrong with him?

35:07.760 --> 35:09.125
Don't mind my little brother.

35:09.200 --> 35:11.407
He was trampled by an elk herd
when he was a calf.

35:11.480 --> 35:12.561
Oh, jeez, that's awful.

35:12.562 --> 35:14.369
That's not true. It was only half a herd.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.240
You're serious, right?

35:16.360 --> 35:17.566
Smooth.

35:18.320 --> 35:22.006
Um, remind me again
who's the better moose matchmaker.

35:22.160 --> 35:23.241
Beginner's luck.

35:23.760 --> 35:24.919
Jealous?

35:24.920 --> 35:26.729
All right, that was a really nice thing...

35:26.800 --> 35:28.643
Did you see me? I did it.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.167
You can do pretty amazing things
with moose. That's great.

35:32.440 --> 35:35.125
Huh? Hey, wait for me!

35:38.280 --> 35:39.441
Oh, oh, Koda, be careful.

35:39.560 --> 35:42.040
Relax, he's fine.
He's just looking for lunch.

35:42.440 --> 35:46.081
Yeah. Besides, I'm always careful. Ow!

35:46.480 --> 35:47.891
Oh, hey, we're making great time.

35:48.360 --> 35:50.203
Look, see, we just go down this trail
until we hit the river.

35:51.720 --> 35:53.324
- River?
- Yeah. And then we swim across.

35:53.680 --> 35:54.759
Swim?

35:54.760 --> 35:56.959
Then it's just a little ways to Hokani Falls.

35:56.960 --> 35:58.530
We'll be there by lunchtime tomorrow.

36:00.240 --> 36:04.245
Well, that's a good plan, but what about this?

36:04.800 --> 36:06.290
We go up this ridge to that mountain,

36:06.280 --> 36:08.123
climb up those cliffs,
walk across that snow bridge

36:08.240 --> 36:09.924
and avoid the river altogether.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.525
That makes more sense to me.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.439
That doesn't make any sense.

36:16.440 --> 36:19.922
That's way out of the way, and there's
too much up and not enough down.

36:20.560 --> 36:21.925
- I vote for the river.
- Me too.

36:22.240 --> 36:23.969
Two-to-one. We win. Let's eat.

36:24.720 --> 36:27.610
- Well, it's my amulet.
- So?

36:27.960 --> 36:29.246
And my wedding.

36:29.360 --> 36:31.919
Well, then have your honeymoon up there,

36:31.920 --> 36:33.160
'cause if we go that way now,

36:33.161 --> 36:35.401
we'll have to walk all night
to make it to the falls in time.

36:35.760 --> 36:37.091
Fine. Then I'll meet you there.

36:37.360 --> 36:38.646
Nita, what's wrong with you?

36:38.840 --> 36:40.683
Trust me.
My way will get us there before...

36:49.440 --> 36:50.771
What's the matter with you?

36:51.040 --> 36:52.883
You act like you're afraid of fish.

36:55.080 --> 36:58.163
My gosh, Kenai, I can't believe it.

36:58.240 --> 36:59.605
Hey, Kenai, watch this.

36:59.920 --> 37:01.999
Where's the girl who's afraid of fish?

37:02.000 --> 37:04.207
Hi, my name is Nita, and I'm afraid of fish.

37:04.600 --> 37:09.128
I have a fish. The fish is so scary!
Oh, no, he's gonna eat me!

37:09.200 --> 37:10.326
Ahem. Koda, come on.

37:11.200 --> 37:12.645
- Koda, stop.
- No, he almost got me.

37:12.646 --> 37:14.210
Koda, stop!

37:21.840 --> 37:24.286
We were just kidding around about the fish.

37:24.720 --> 37:26.484
No, it's not the fish.

37:28.720 --> 37:30.882
It's the water.

37:32.720 --> 37:36.167
Ever since that day I fell through the ice
when we were kids...

37:37.680 --> 37:38.761
Oh...

37:39.720 --> 37:40.960
I didn't realise.

37:41.560 --> 37:44.086
That's why I didn't grab the bag in the river.

37:45.840 --> 37:48.207
It wasn't your fault we lost the amulet.

37:50.520 --> 37:51.931
It was mine.

37:53.040 --> 37:56.283
Hey, we got it back together.
That's all that matters, right?

38:01.440 --> 38:02.930
What are you looking at?

38:05.320 --> 38:06.731
You ready to keep going?

38:07.040 --> 38:10.408
But I'll never be able to cross that river.

38:10.800 --> 38:12.290
We can do that together, too.

38:17.080 --> 38:19.048
<i>Funny how it turns out</i>

38:19.120 --> 38:21.759
<i>That everything can change</i>

38:21.760 --> 38:25.765
<i>What I feel right now</i>
<i>is not the same as yesterday</i>

38:26.080 --> 38:28.560
<i>There's more than I imagined</i>

38:28.800 --> 38:30.882
<i>Deep inside my heart</i>

38:31.000 --> 38:33.279
<i>Emotions that I never knew</i>

38:33.280 --> 38:35.521
<i>And this is just the start</i>

38:36.160 --> 38:40.239
<i>So many things</i>
<i>I've been missing not watching</i>

38:40.240 --> 38:43.528
<i>But that was all in the past</i>

38:43.640 --> 38:48.599
<i>Now I realise</i>
<i>there's so much more to learn</i>

38:48.600 --> 38:50.762
<i>I'm ready for the world</i>

38:51.080 --> 38:53.003
<i>Not scared of letting go</i>

38:53.080 --> 38:57.919
<i>Now I realise</i>
<i>there's so much more to feel</i>

38:57.920 --> 39:00.161
<i>And my heart knows it's real</i>

39:00.440 --> 39:03.683
<i>The part of me so long-forgotten</i>

39:03.760 --> 39:07.479
<i>Is calling, and this feels like home</i>

39:07.480 --> 39:09.767
<i>Home, home</i>

39:09.880 --> 39:14.759
<i>Feels just like home</i>

39:14.760 --> 39:17.843
<i>Right from the start,</i>
<i>been friends forever</i>

39:19.200 --> 39:23.205
<i>Somehow we're meant to be together</i>

39:23.960 --> 39:28.999
<i>I feel like you've shown me</i>
<i>how to find my way home</i>

39:29.000 --> 39:30.650
<i>Find my way home</i>

39:30.800 --> 39:35.679
<i>Now I realise so much more to learn</i>

39:35.680 --> 39:37.639
<i>I'm ready for the world</i>

39:37.640 --> 39:39.927
<i>Not scared of letting go</i>

39:40.040 --> 39:44.807
<i>Now I realise</i>
<i>there's so much more to feel</i>

39:44.880 --> 39:47.247
<i>And my heart knows it's real</i>

39:47.520 --> 39:50.808
<i>The part of me so long-forgotten</i>

39:50.880 --> 39:54.487
<i>Is calling, and this feels like home</i>

39:54.560 --> 39:56.927
<i>Home, home</i>

39:57.080 --> 39:59.367
<i>Feels just like home</i>

40:10.320 --> 40:11.651
It's the only way.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.206
Let me help you.

40:22.520 --> 40:23.681
I changed my mind.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.679
Nope, it's too late for that.
We're going across.

40:26.680 --> 40:29.604
- Whatever happens, don't let go.
- Okay.

40:30.680 --> 40:35.208
<i>Now I realise</i>
<i>there's so much more to learn</i>

40:35.680 --> 40:39.890

40:40.200 --> 40:44.762

40:50.840 --> 40:54.083
<i>Is calling, and this feels like home</i>

40:54.200 --> 40:56.202
I did it! I did it!

40:57.080 --> 40:58.206
<i>This feels like home</i>

40:58.360 --> 41:00.089
Thank you, Kenai.

41:00.200 --> 41:02.039
<i>Home, home</i>

41:02.040 --> 41:06.648
<i>Feels just like home</i>

41:19.760 --> 41:23.207
Hey, smallish bear.
So where's big bear, eh?

41:23.880 --> 41:25.325
With Nita.

41:26.320 --> 41:30.609
He never has time for me any more.
He's too busy helping her.

41:31.080 --> 41:34.004
Shee! Boy, do I know how you feel.

41:34.080 --> 41:38.369
My own brother gave me the heave-ho,
eh, all for a babe.

41:38.760 --> 41:41.240
Actually, two really, really hot babes.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.771
Better watch your brother
doesn't walk out on you, eh.

41:46.920 --> 41:48.410
He wouldn't do that.

41:49.240 --> 41:51.004
I said the same thing, eh,

41:51.080 --> 41:53.321
but get a load of Moose-anova
over there.

41:53.600 --> 41:56.809
Shall I compare thee to a summer's dew?

41:56.880 --> 41:58.439
Did you just make that up?

41:58.440 --> 41:59.930
- Beauty, eh.
- He's such a poet.

42:02.760 --> 42:05.411
Yeah, I guess I'll see you around, little bear.

42:28.120 --> 42:30.771
- You had a whole clumpful.
- Oh, you're making that up.

42:30.840 --> 42:33.730
All I know is I had all my fur
when we went into the river,

42:33.800 --> 42:35.370
and two handfuls were missing when we came out.

42:35.600 --> 42:37.799
- Well, maybe you're just going bald.
- What?

42:37.800 --> 42:40.963
You know, it does look
really thin right through here.

42:41.240 --> 42:43.083
Yeah, very funny.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.519
This is the most fun I've had
since we were kids.

42:48.320 --> 42:50.368
Fun but cold.

42:50.440 --> 42:52.727
On a night like this, it's good to be a bear.

42:53.040 --> 42:54.451
I bet.

43:03.320 --> 43:06.005
So, Hokani Falls.

43:07.560 --> 43:10.211
I guess we'll make it there in time, huh?

43:11.040 --> 43:12.326
I guess.

43:13.080 --> 43:15.970
A lot sure has changed
since the last time we were there.

43:16.840 --> 43:18.171
No kidding.

43:20.000 --> 43:23.049
Do you ever miss being human?

43:23.680 --> 43:30.165
I mean, have you ever thought about
changing back?

43:34.880 --> 43:36.325
Yeah, I've...

43:37.120 --> 43:38.879
I've thought about it.

43:38.880 --> 43:40.006
I knew it.

43:41.880 --> 43:42.927
Koda.

43:44.600 --> 43:45.886
You're going back with her.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.411
Koda, wait. Koda, wait!

43:56.840 --> 43:57.887
Koda!

44:03.360 --> 44:05.010
Koda, answer me!

44:23.800 --> 44:24.881
Koda!

44:41.760 --> 44:43.046
Hello?

44:46.040 --> 44:48.691
Koda? Are you in here?

44:57.400 --> 44:58.890
Where are you?

44:59.880 --> 45:01.370
Koda?

45:04.360 --> 45:05.407
Koda?

45:05.880 --> 45:07.245
Go away.

45:07.800 --> 45:12.203
Koda, Kenai's worried sick about you.
Come on, I'll take you to him.

45:12.440 --> 45:14.522
No! I said go away!

45:17.400 --> 45:20.688
Koda, please keep your voice down.
It's not safe.

45:20.760 --> 45:23.001
I don't care. Just leave me alone.

45:26.360 --> 45:27.566
No, Nita!

45:29.560 --> 45:31.483
We're gonna be all right, but we've got to go.

45:32.800 --> 45:33.801
Now!

45:36.320 --> 45:39.483
Run! Run! Run! Faster!

45:43.320 --> 45:44.765
We're gonna make it.

45:46.800 --> 45:48.802
- Nita!
- Take my hand.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.081
Don't move.

46:09.320 --> 46:10.367
Koda!

46:11.640 --> 46:12.846
Hang on!

46:13.680 --> 46:14.681
Nita!

46:14.800 --> 46:15.847
Don't let go!

46:19.640 --> 46:21.927
- Koda, hold on!
- I am!

46:32.440 --> 46:33.680
Koda.

46:48.040 --> 46:51.840
Koda, what would I have done
if anything happened to you?

46:52.800 --> 46:57.681
You're gonna leave me.
You said you missed being one of them.

47:08.600 --> 47:11.001
You're going back with her, aren't you?

47:12.720 --> 47:14.290
I do miss things,

47:15.800 --> 47:17.245
but you're my brother.

47:18.040 --> 47:19.929
I'll never leave you.

47:20.360 --> 47:23.091
Ah. Not ever.

47:58.520 --> 48:00.959
Ah, this show's giving me the munchies, eh.

48:00.960 --> 48:03.327
Hey, little brother,
how about you get us some twigs, eh?

48:03.440 --> 48:05.647
Okay.

48:06.960 --> 48:08.325
Are you crying?

48:09.080 --> 48:12.766
No. I mean, well, yeah, but so what, eh?

48:12.960 --> 48:15.327
These lights are so beautiful, eh, I...

48:16.880 --> 48:18.803
Oh, he's sensitive.

48:19.160 --> 48:20.764
A moose with depth?

48:21.240 --> 48:22.969
It's beauty, eh.

48:23.480 --> 48:24.606
What?

48:24.680 --> 48:26.359
He's a cute one, isn't he?

48:26.360 --> 48:28.647
Hey, I can be sensitive, too, eh.

48:29.000 --> 48:30.650
Ooh, I like your hooves.

48:30.760 --> 48:31.839
Really?

48:31.840 --> 48:35.765
Yeah, and I'm a hoof man.
Yours are nice and shiny.

48:37.760 --> 48:40.331
Hoof man? Why didn't I think of that?

49:21.200 --> 49:22.929
Is this the equinox?

49:23.920 --> 49:26.571
Yeah, Koda, this is it.

49:57.560 --> 49:59.449
My mom is up there somewhere.

50:00.360 --> 50:01.850
My mom, too.

50:02.640 --> 50:05.007
Do you miss yours?

50:07.240 --> 50:08.446
Yes.

50:09.480 --> 50:13.610
But you don't need to wait for the lights
to find her, Koda.

50:14.680 --> 50:16.444
She's always with you.

50:17.320 --> 50:18.731
In here.

50:19.840 --> 50:25.324
Once you love someone,
they stay in your heart forever.

50:33.960 --> 50:35.610
It's time.

51:22.920 --> 51:25.924
Koda, you be good, okay?

51:27.600 --> 51:29.602
You're such a sweet little cub.

51:34.280 --> 51:36.886
Oh, the spell.

51:51.000 --> 51:52.365
Goodbye.

52:08.120 --> 52:10.521
<i>If you hear a voice</i>

52:11.160 --> 52:13.845
<i>In the middle of the night</i>

52:14.720 --> 52:17.041
<i>Saying it'll be all right</i>

52:18.040 --> 52:20.566
<i>It will be me</i>

52:21.280 --> 52:23.806
<i>If you feel a hand</i>

52:24.520 --> 52:27.091
<i>Guiding you along</i>

52:27.720 --> 52:30.530
<i>When the path seems wrong</i>

52:31.160 --> 52:33.640
<i>It will be me</i>

52:34.360 --> 52:37.250
<i>There is no mountain</i>

52:37.520 --> 52:40.171
<i>That I can't climb</i>

52:40.800 --> 52:46.648
<i>For you, I'd swim through</i>
<i>the rivers of time</i>

52:47.240 --> 52:53.009
<i>As you go your way and I go mine</i>

52:53.760 --> 52:56.604
<i>Our light will shine</i>

52:56.920 --> 53:01.369
<i>And it will be me</i>

53:03.520 --> 53:08.003
<i>It will be me</i>

53:09.800 --> 53:15.091
<i>It will be me</i>

53:29.480 --> 53:33.804
Kenai, did you give Nita the amulet
because you loved her?

53:37.440 --> 53:39.204
It was a long time ago.

53:39.800 --> 53:42.963
But she's still with you in here.

53:43.760 --> 53:45.205
I can tell.

53:45.440 --> 53:48.649
Ah, Koda, it doesn't matter.

53:49.960 --> 53:53.681
Well, if you do love her,
shouldn't you tell her?

53:54.400 --> 53:57.404
It's a little more complicated than that.

53:58.800 --> 54:01.690
Anyway, it's over.

54:02.960 --> 54:06.931
Hey, I promised you we'd be the
first two bears to Crowberry Ridge.

54:07.600 --> 54:09.443
Pinkie swear, remember?

54:10.240 --> 54:13.722
How about first thing in the morning,
we rustle up some more berries?

54:13.800 --> 54:15.006
Sound good?

54:40.640 --> 54:43.644
Mom, Kenai's so sad.

54:45.040 --> 54:46.849
It's all because of me.

54:48.880 --> 54:50.882
I'll be okay on my own.

54:51.520 --> 54:55.445
Tell the spirits to change Kenai back
so he can be happy.

55:12.560 --> 55:14.403
- Jeez, he's really out, eh.
- Yeah.

55:14.404 --> 55:16.439
Maybe we should throw some water on his face.

55:16.440 --> 55:18.727
Why don't you just stand
there drooling, eh? That should do it.

55:18.800 --> 55:19.847
Trample off.

55:19.960 --> 55:21.928
Oh, wait. Hey, I think I saw him move.

55:24.400 --> 55:26.562
Rise and shine, bear boy!

55:26.680 --> 55:28.728
Yeah, not time to hydroplane yet, eh.

55:28.880 --> 55:31.167
- It's hibernate, you hoofer.
- That's what I said.

55:31.400 --> 55:33.243
Hey, we saw smallish bear last night.

55:33.440 --> 55:36.239
Yeah, we tried to stop him, eh,
but he wouldn't listen to us.

55:36.240 --> 55:37.919
What? Where was he going?

55:37.920 --> 55:39.279
Uh... Oh.

55:39.280 --> 55:40.691
To get Nita, eh.

55:40.760 --> 55:42.649
He said he was gonna bring her back for you.

55:42.650 --> 55:45.644
Bring her back? No, no.

55:45.840 --> 55:48.207
If he steps foot in the village,
the hunters will get him.

55:49.920 --> 55:51.445
Oh, gee.

55:54.360 --> 55:55.799
Almost there.

55:55.800 --> 55:59.850
And now for the final touch,
a beautiful bead necklace.

55:59.920 --> 56:02.321
Oh, no, you don't. Not this time.

56:02.400 --> 56:04.279
This is much more appropriate.

56:04.280 --> 56:06.521
Yeah, and that doesn't match
anything she's wearing.

56:06.600 --> 56:08.602
And what makes you think those beads do?

56:09.000 --> 56:11.287
Nita, what would make you happy?

56:17.000 --> 56:18.650
Once again, we are ready.

56:20.200 --> 56:21.645
Are you, my daughter?

56:23.160 --> 56:24.321
Yes, Father.

56:30.280 --> 56:34.080
I would expect a bride
to be smiling on her wedding day.

56:35.320 --> 56:36.890
Is there something wrong?

56:38.840 --> 56:42.003
Daddy, I'm so confused.

56:44.920 --> 56:48.481
I thought that when I burned the amulet,
the bond would be broken,

56:51.240 --> 56:53.208
but in my heart, I...

56:56.720 --> 56:58.449
I'm sorry, Daddy.

57:00.240 --> 57:02.049
I can't marry Atka.

57:07.520 --> 57:08.567
Nita...

57:08.640 --> 57:11.120
A bear! There's a bear in the village!

57:11.920 --> 57:13.285
It's a bear.

57:13.560 --> 57:16.211
Koda? Wait! Wait, don't hurt him.

57:17.000 --> 57:18.286
No, our fish!

57:19.080 --> 57:20.127
I got him!

57:20.680 --> 57:22.011
We've got him now!

57:22.760 --> 57:25.650
- Look, he's up in the tree!
- There he is. Get him!

57:26.120 --> 57:27.239
Don't!

57:27.240 --> 57:28.605
Don't! Please stop!

57:33.720 --> 57:35.449
Look out, here he comes!

57:38.880 --> 57:40.245
- Get your spears!
- Come on!

57:40.360 --> 57:42.044
- Let's go after him.
- Atka, no!

57:43.560 --> 57:45.767
- Leave him alone.
- Get him!

57:51.160 --> 57:52.764
Oh, no. Run!

57:52.880 --> 57:54.006
This way.

57:55.920 --> 57:57.331
After them!

57:58.040 --> 57:59.405
Nita, are you hurt?

57:59.560 --> 58:00.891
I have to stop them.

58:03.720 --> 58:06.007
There he is! Let's get him!

58:10.440 --> 58:11.566
Follow me!

58:14.000 --> 58:16.446
Rock! Look out! Get out of the way!

58:20.200 --> 58:21.361
Stay low.

58:23.240 --> 58:24.241
Kenai!

58:32.920 --> 58:34.081
Hmm...

58:36.560 --> 58:38.847
There you are. Got you!

58:49.120 --> 58:50.121
Nice move, eh.

58:50.200 --> 58:52.009
Gee, eh.

58:52.080 --> 58:54.731
Oh! Our heroes.

58:56.680 --> 58:57.806
Beauty, eh.

58:57.880 --> 59:00.281
Come on! We have to find Kenai.

59:23.440 --> 59:25.283
Aah!

59:32.480 --> 59:33.720
Kenai!

59:41.880 --> 59:43.325
No, don't!

59:50.000 --> 59:51.161
Kenai!

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:06.526
How could you?

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:09.123
- What?
- He was my friend.

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.046
Kenai?

01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:00.645
I can't... I don't understand. I'm sorry.

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:20.650
I love you, too.

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.321
The spirits?

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:45.243
Kenai, I can understand you.

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:49.130
I asked the spirits to turn you back into a man.

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:51.450
- What?
- So you could be with Nita.

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:53.641
No, Koda.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:57.601
It's okay.
I just want you to be happy again.

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:03.124
Nita, I can't.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.411
But I can.

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:17.562
Am I the only one that hears
these bears speaking?

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:20.325
- Yeah, that's beauty, eh.
- How's it going, eh?

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.006
Father.

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.010
Is this what you want?

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:31.644
Will this make you happy?

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:37.809
You are my daughter

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:40.724
and I will love you no matter what you choose.

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:47.959
Nita?

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:55.170
How do I look?

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:58.882
Like a bear, except they gave you antlers.

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.326
What?

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:02.125
Gotcha!

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.123
<i>Life is simple and clear</i>

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.728
<i>When you make the right choice</i>

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:27.689
<i>It's truth that you hear</i>

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:30.320
<i>When you find your own voice</i>

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:34.086
<i>Oh, my brothers and sisters, believe</i>

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:37.966
<i>You are just what you are meant to be</i>

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:41.408
<i>Oh, great spirits</i>

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:46.805
<i>Hear my voice today</i>

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:49.690
- I love happy endings, eh.
- I love happy endings, too.

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:51.564
And happy beginnings.

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:53.485
- Beauty, eh.
- Beauty.

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.330
Ow!

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:04.444
<i>Look all around you</i>

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.731
<i>Welcome, magic</i>

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:10.846
<i>Welcome, sweet sun ray</i>

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:13.048
<i>Welcome, my sweet sun ray</i>

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:14.565
<i>Love is no secret</i>

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:17.002
<i>Look all around you</i>

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:20.249
<i>Welcome to this day</i>

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:23.679
<i>Welcome, magic</i>

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:25.808
<i>Love is no secret</i>

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.999
<i>Look all around you</i>

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.641
<i>Welcome to this day</i>

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:57.519
<i>Learning how to smile again</i>

01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.522
<i>Free to show my heart</i>

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:04.249
<i>Knowing I can face the things</i>
<i>that used to seem too hard</i>

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:06.881
<i>I look inside your eyes and see</i>

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.879
<i>A different part of me</i>

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:11.611
<i>What I didn't know I want in life</i>

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:13.921
<i>You're everything I need</i>

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:18.559
<i>So many things I've been missin'</i>
<i>and not watchin'</i>

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:21.962
<i>But that was all in the past</i>

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:26.802
<i>Now I realise</i>
<i>there's so much more to learn</i>

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:29.119
<i>I'm ready for the world</i>

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:31.399
<i>Not scared of letting go</i>

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:36.008
<i>Now I realise</i>
<i>there's so much more to feel</i>

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:38.680
<i>And my heart knows it's real</i>

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:42.003
<i>The part of me so long-forgotten</i>

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:45.607
<i>Is calling, and this feels like home</i>

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.079
<i>Home, home</i>

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:52.959
<i>Feels just like home</i>

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:56.089
<i>Right from the start,</i>
<i>been friends forever</i>

01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:01.121
<i>Somehow we're meant to be together</i>

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:06.762
<i>I feel like you've shown me</i>
<i>how to find my way home</i>

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:09.279
<i>Find my way home</i>

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:11.567
<i>Now I realise</i>

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.480
<i>It feels just like home</i>

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:18.839
<i>Feels just like home</i>

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:21.286
<i>It feels just like home</i>

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:23.886
<i>Feels just like home</i>

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:25.803
<i>Yeah</i>

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:30.126
<i>Feels like home</i>

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:34.808
<i>Now I realise</i>
<i>there's so much more to learn</i>

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:37.319
<i>I'm ready for the world</i>

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.639
<i>Not scared of letting go</i>

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:44.123
<i>Now I realise</i>
<i>there's so much more to feel</i>

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:46.960
<i>And my heart knows it's real</i>

01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:50.209
<i>The part of me so long-forgotten</i>

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:53.762
<i>Is calling, and this feels like home</i>

01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:58.648
<i>This feels like home</i>

01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:01.081
<i>Home, home</i>

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:04.323
<i>Feels just like home</i>

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.766
<i>Feels just like home</i>

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:32.046
<i>If you hear a voice</i>

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:35.524
<i>In the middle of the night</i>

01:08:36.439 --> 01:08:38.727
<i>Sayin' it'll be all right</i>

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.529
<i>It will be me</i>

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:45.046
<i>If you feel a hand</i>

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:48.281
<i>Guiding you along</i>

01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:52.045
<i>When the path seems wrong</i>

01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:54.921
<i>It will be me</i>

01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:58.850
<i>There is no mountain</i>

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:01.651
<i>That I can't climb</i>

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:07.929
<i>For you, I'd swim through</i>
<i>the rivers of time</i>

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:14.602
<i>As you go your way and I go mine</i>

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:17.930
<i>Our light will shine</i>

01:09:18.359 --> 01:09:22.729
<i>And it will be me</i>

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:30.486
<i>If there is a key</i>

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:33.890
<i>That goes to your heart</i>

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:37.202
<i>A special part</i>

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.367
<i>It will be me</i>

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:43.407
<i>If you need a friend</i>

01:09:44.479 --> 01:09:46.881
<i>Call out to the wind</i>

01:09:47.359 --> 01:09:49.930
<i>To hold you again</i>

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:53.361
<i>It will be me</i>

01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:56.561
<i>Oh, how the world</i>

01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:59.760
<i>Seems so unfair</i>

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:06.127
<i>Creating a love</i>
<i>that cannot be shared</i>

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:13.242
<i>As you go your way and I go mine</i>

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:16.331
<i>Our light will shine</i>

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:21.522
<i>And it will be me</i>

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:29.762
<i>Past the ever after</i>

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:35.331
<i>There's a place for two</i>

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:42.170
<i>In your tears and laughter</i>

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:49.008
<i>I'll be there for you</i>

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:54.971
<i>In the sun and the moon</i>

01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:58.284
<i>In the land and the sea</i>

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:01.611
<i>Look all around you</i>

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:04.840
<i>It will be me</i>

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:08.331
<i>There is no mountain</i>

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:10.967
<i>That I can't climb</i>

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:17.563
<i>For you, I'd swim through</i>
<i>the rivers of time</i>

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:24.283
<i>As you go your way and I go mine</i>

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.401
<i>Our light will shine</i>

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:32.045
<i>And it will be me</i>

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:38.521
<i>It will be me</i>

01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:46.406
<i>It will be me</i>
