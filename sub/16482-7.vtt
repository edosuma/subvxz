08:26.728 --> 08:28.912
Oh, it's just rehearsal, right?

08:28.937 --> 08:31.648
Yeah, but it's my first
rehearsal in ten years.

08:31.650 --> 08:33.316
You're gonna do great, babe.

08:35.296 --> 08:37.236
- (clears throat)
- Hey, uh,

08:37.239 --> 08:39.739
what are you planning on wearing
to the boy's game tonight?

08:39.741 --> 08:41.792
Because I know we usually
wear Kevin's colors, but now

08:41.794 --> 08:43.210
that Randall's playing
for another school...

08:43.212 --> 08:44.544
The game. Crap.

08:44.546 --> 08:46.580
Um, I'm meeting Bob Parrish tonight

08:46.582 --> 08:48.648
to close the Doylestown deal.

08:49.375 --> 08:51.168
- Doylestown?
- Yeah.

08:51.170 --> 08:53.336
Really? So you got it?

08:53.757 --> 08:55.531
I-I told you last week.

08:55.882 --> 08:58.425
Well, I'm sure I would have
remembered if you said that.

08:58.427 --> 09:02.012
- Oh, I know that I did.
- Okay, well,

09:02.014 --> 09:04.431
is there any way that
you can move the meeting

09:04.433 --> 09:06.233
because that coach is
coming to scout Kevin?

09:06.235 --> 09:07.968
It's a really big game for him.

09:08.187 --> 09:11.605
It's a big day for me,
too, and a big day for you.

09:11.835 --> 09:13.490
And a big day for Kevin, so...

09:13.492 --> 09:14.608
(sighs)

09:14.992 --> 09:16.693
I'll see what I can do.

09:16.695 --> 09:18.161
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:18.647 --> 09:21.054
- Jack?
- Yeah.

09:24.453 --> 09:26.753
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

09:28.453 --> 09:31.258
I'm all over the place.

09:31.260 --> 09:32.709
- Have a good day.
- Have fun.

09:32.711 --> 09:34.031
Thanks.

09:53.007 --> 09:54.506
Yeah.

09:55.608 --> 09:57.341
- RANDALL: No, of course.
- Hey.

09:57.366 --> 09:59.677
I totally understand. We
can do dinner another time.

09:59.679 --> 10:02.093
That was Mom? She's not
coming? What'd she say?

10:02.118 --> 10:03.921
Yeah. Well, tell Miguel
I hope he feels better soon.

10:03.946 --> 10:04.968
Let me talk to her. Is Miguel sick?

10:04.993 --> 10:06.522
- Let me just talk to her real quick.
- Yeah, I'll tell Kevin.

10:06.547 --> 10:07.327
Just give me the phone.

10:07.352 --> 10:08.725
- Just put her on speaker.
- We can reschedule.

10:08.750 --> 10:10.014
Just let me talk to her before you go.

10:10.039 --> 10:11.069
Love you, too. Bye.

10:11.094 --> 10:12.536
Before she... Let
me talk to her for...

10:12.561 --> 10:13.796
Oh. It's Miguel's gout.

10:13.821 --> 10:15.991
Really? I didn't know they
made gout anymore.

10:16.015 --> 10:17.469
Yeah.

10:17.470 --> 10:19.475
- So she's not coming then?
- No.

10:19.510 --> 10:21.655
Not coming. Oh, okay.

10:21.680 --> 10:23.218
(exhales)

10:23.243 --> 10:24.909
- It's the two of us.
- Yes.

10:24.934 --> 10:25.546
Yeah.

10:25.571 --> 10:27.124
I mean, if you got
work to do though, I...

10:27.149 --> 10:28.405
- we don't have to go.
- No!

10:28.430 --> 10:30.263
- I'm, I'm okay.
- You're all right?

10:30.288 --> 10:33.077
- Yeah.
- Uh, if you've got lines to learn

10:33.102 --> 10:35.903
- or something, then we can...
- I'm good. I'm up to speed, so...

10:37.594 --> 10:39.124

10:39.659 --> 10:40.639

10:40.664 --> 10:43.965
BETH: Hey, girls, wash up and come down.

10:45.710 --> 10:49.078
So, Kevin and Randall are out tonight.

10:50.087 --> 10:52.694
It'll just be you and us ladies.

10:53.058 --> 10:55.725
Nothing for me, thanks.

10:57.337 --> 10:59.671
(coughs)

11:02.862 --> 11:05.563
You know, my dad had cancer.

11:07.132 --> 11:08.358
Lung.

11:10.104 --> 11:11.944
I didn't want to say
anything 'cause, you know,

11:11.969 --> 11:14.538
it wasn't exactly a
happy ending for him.

11:16.043 --> 11:17.991
Endings rarely are.

11:23.135 --> 11:24.561
Weed helped.

11:26.193 --> 11:29.027

11:29.492 --> 11:31.242
I just figured with your history,

11:31.244 --> 11:32.702
I didn't want to bring
that up because of...

11:32.727 --> 11:35.728
No... Marijuana doesn't have
the same kind of trigger.

11:36.449 --> 11:37.874
Even my doctor said.

11:37.899 --> 11:39.315
Hmm.

11:39.968 --> 11:41.502
Can't have you going out in the night

11:41.504 --> 11:43.137
scoring drugs on my account.

11:43.139 --> 11:45.132
What... what if I was to
tell you I had a little stash?

11:45.921 --> 11:48.259
Then I'd say, woman, you surprise me.

11:48.261 --> 11:50.061
And I'm not easily surprised.

11:50.063 --> 11:51.944
How about I feed the girls, right?

11:51.969 --> 11:53.719
Get their asses in bed,

11:53.900 --> 11:56.093
and bake us up some special brownies.

11:56.952 --> 11:58.686

- You like that?

This place is great, right?

12:06.579 --> 12:07.132
Yeah.

12:07.157 --> 12:09.974
Yeah. The last time I was here,
I bro'ed out with Mario Lopez.

12:09.999 --> 12:11.225
I don't know who that is.

12:11.250 --> 12:12.741
Oh, okay. (laughs)

Oh, my God. We love you.

12:14.657 --> 12:17.816
Yeah? All right, well, cool.
Let's, uh... do a selfie.

12:17.841 --> 12:20.258
- Give it to me, I'll take it.
- No, no, it's a selfie.

12:20.260 --> 12:22.510
- It's a thing.
- Right. Got it.

12:22.512 --> 12:25.179

KEVIN: That's gonna turn out great.

12:28.017 --> 12:29.717

12:53.430 --> 12:54.986

all right? We'll still be us, I promise.

18:02.873 --> 18:04.072
Okay?

18:10.887 --> 18:12.654
(rock song playing)

18:12.679 --> 18:14.753
- Hey.
- Hey, congrats.

18:14.778 --> 18:16.077
Heard you got your own room.

18:16.293 --> 18:18.216
Yeah. (chuckles)

18:19.466 --> 18:21.179
What's up with you?

18:21.555 --> 18:23.771
- Nothing.
- Randall.

18:25.552 --> 18:27.552
Why does he hate me so much?

18:27.982 --> 18:30.188
Kevin doesn't hate you.

18:30.190 --> 18:33.052
You guys are just so intense
with each other, you know?

18:33.077 --> 18:34.994
Try lightening things up a little.

18:35.019 --> 18:36.435
Joke around with him more.

18:40.021 --> 18:42.166
You know Mom is gonna
kill you if she sees you

18:42.168 --> 18:43.880
putting on all that makeup, right?

18:44.553 --> 18:45.834
(chuckles)

18:49.584 --> 18:51.383
Pop-Tarts
and Yoo-Hoo.

18:51.385 --> 18:53.052
Breakfast of champions.

18:54.029 --> 18:57.389
- What do you want?
- I just came to see your dungeon.

18:57.391 --> 19:01.440
- I mean, your digs.
- I think it's cool.

19:01.465 --> 19:03.965
Yeah... totally.

19:04.763 --> 19:08.029
In a couple days you won't notice
that funky mildew, And the asbestos.

19:08.054 --> 19:09.920
I'd give it at least a year
till it's imbedded in your lungs.

19:09.945 --> 19:11.716
Randall, can you please
just get out of here, man?

19:11.741 --> 19:13.081
Look, I came down here
to get away from you.

19:13.106 --> 19:15.572
- Dude, I was just joking.
- Are you deaf?

19:16.035 --> 19:17.284
I said get out.

- Yeah.

21:54.677 --> 21:55.621
Out of context...

21:55.646 --> 21:56.519
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:56.544 --> 21:57.824
I must have missed that episode.

22:03.385 --> 22:06.386
He was a series regular,
actually, on the show.

22:09.787 --> 22:11.620
For four years, he was a series regular.

22:18.865 --> 22:20.832
Have you ever seen... my show?

22:20.857 --> 22:22.543
- Of course I have. Yeah.
- Yeah?

22:22.834 --> 22:23.916
What was my, uh,

22:23.941 --> 22:25.246
what was my character's name?

22:25.271 --> 22:27.696
Don't tell him. What was my
character's name on the show?

22:33.652 --> 22:35.050
(whispering): Wow.

22:35.075 --> 22:36.074
(sighs)

22:36.099 --> 22:37.207
(laughs) Okay.

22:37.232 --> 22:39.316
- Kevin.
- No, no, man, it's all right.

22:39.341 --> 22:41.090
- Just finish the dinner, man.
- It's all right, it's all right,

22:41.115 --> 22:42.147
it's all right.

22:45.505 --> 22:46.894
Good talk.

22:49.215 --> 22:50.348
(Toby laughs)

22:50.803 --> 22:53.300
And so this, uh, dog

22:53.325 --> 22:54.991
just keeps getting reincarnated.

22:55.016 --> 22:57.715
(laughs) And so,

22:57.740 --> 23:00.491
and so, it's like he...
I think he's a schna...

23:00.516 --> 23:02.043
like a schnauzer, like,

23:02.068 --> 23:04.818
poodle mix and he's running around town

23:04.843 --> 23:07.832
trying to solve crimes, but
he keeps getting hit by cars.

23:08.306 --> 23:10.121
Yeah, yeah, thank you.

23:10.146 --> 23:10.902
Thank you.

23:11.026 --> 23:12.158
And did you see what happened here?

23:12.183 --> 23:13.216
You had chicken.

23:13.241 --> 23:14.340
I had the chicken.

23:14.365 --> 23:15.447
We are in this together.

23:15.472 --> 23:16.721
- Right?
- Thank you.

23:16.746 --> 23:18.136
Would you two like to
see our dessert tray?

23:18.161 --> 23:19.644
Uh, no, thank you.

23:19.669 --> 23:22.003
Walk away, fine sir.

23:22.766 --> 23:24.265
Hey, wait.

23:24.689 --> 23:26.199
He'll have a look.

23:26.224 --> 23:27.363
I will?

23:27.388 --> 23:28.804
Dude, I know you want it,

23:28.829 --> 23:30.829
and if you don't have it
here, you're gonna go home,

23:30.854 --> 23:32.437
you're gonna stuff your face and
you're gonna lie to me about it.

23:32.462 --> 23:33.511
(sighs)

23:33.536 --> 23:34.558
You'll have a full-on

23:34.583 --> 23:35.715
food mistress and I...

23:37.053 --> 23:38.887
But I will never love her

23:38.912 --> 23:40.168
(whispering): the way that I love you.

23:40.193 --> 23:41.742
This is not a joke.

23:41.767 --> 23:43.736
- I'm being serious.
- Okay, all right, okay, okay.

23:43.761 --> 23:45.352
How are we gonna make
this relationship work

23:45.377 --> 23:47.816
if we're gonna keep things
from each other? Hmmm?

23:55.274 --> 23:56.774
I'll just have to handle it.

23:58.047 --> 24:00.465
- All right.
- Okay.

24:16.418 --> 24:18.219

indistinctly over speakers)

24:20.808 --> 24:23.715

24:30.210 --> 24:31.242
(chuckles)

24:31.267 --> 24:32.097
I'm trying to remain neutral.

24:32.122 --> 24:33.668
- Yeah?
- Okay. Yeah.

24:33.693 --> 24:34.942
(chuckles)

24:36.547 --> 24:38.247
Wait, where's Kevin?

You hated the show! You were
so ashamed of it, you quit.

Not at first. At first, I was
proud of that show, Randall.

27:22.155 --> 27:23.472
And I invited every single

(Randall laughs)

27:36.669 --> 27:39.704
Now that... that is funny.

27:39.706 --> 27:41.574
That's great.

27:41.791 --> 27:44.144
Replaced by another black man.

27:44.169 --> 27:45.910
What the hell did you just say?

27:45.952 --> 27:47.819
No. "Replaced by another black man."

27:47.844 --> 27:49.379
- Hey, you tell me what that means.
- Don't worry about it, Randall.

27:49.573 --> 27:51.308
No. Please, Kevin. Let's hear it, right?

27:51.333 --> 27:52.730
What are you harboring? 'Cause God knows

27:52.755 --> 27:54.088
I would really love to hear this.

27:54.113 --> 27:55.519
You always got special treatment.

27:55.544 --> 27:56.730
Because I'm black?

27:56.755 --> 27:58.136
No, because you're
black and you're adopted.

27:58.161 --> 28:00.199
Oh, yeah, hit the jackpot
with that combination.

28:00.224 --> 28:02.550
- Couldn't have had it any easier.
- In our house, you did.

28:02.575 --> 28:04.175
- With our mother, you did.
- Oh, right.

28:04.200 --> 28:06.144
- Okay, here we go.
- Why can't you just admit it, man?

28:06.169 --> 28:06.885
Admit what?

28:06.910 --> 28:08.737
Just admit that you were more
important to her, and that

28:08.762 --> 28:10.699
she wanted to make sure that you
felt special every single minute

28:10.724 --> 28:12.308
- of every single day so that
- Yeah.

28:12.333 --> 28:14.048
You wouldn't feel like the odd man out.

28:14.073 --> 28:15.323
Well, gee, Kevin, I wonder why

28:15.325 --> 28:16.316
she was worried about
me feeling that way?

28:16.341 --> 28:17.207
What the hell does that mean?

28:17.232 --> 28:19.269
- Just go back to your hotel.
- No. No, hold on.

28:19.294 --> 28:20.911
Randall, hold... No.
What does that mean?

28:20.936 --> 28:23.019
It means you treated me like a dog.

28:23.236 --> 28:26.074
And just like a dog, I kept
coming back again and again,

28:26.099 --> 28:28.511
just hoping for a scrap from you,

28:28.543 --> 28:32.590
like a crumb of affection
or kindness or respect.

28:32.615 --> 28:34.527
- Respect? You wanted my respect?
- Yeah.

28:34.552 --> 28:36.972
Yeah, okay. No, you wanted
to show me up, Randall.

28:36.997 --> 28:39.157
Which is what you did
every single chance you got.

28:39.182 --> 28:40.855
- No, I did not.
- You showed me up!

28:40.880 --> 28:42.130
I'm done with this conversation.

28:42.155 --> 28:43.571
- Done with this conversation?
- In any other family,

28:43.596 --> 28:45.396
- I would have been the star!
- Yeah, you know what, bro?

28:45.421 --> 28:48.035
You're no star. That is a star.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.392
Get your hands off me.
Get your hands off me.

28:49.957 --> 28:51.325
You don't push my body.

28:51.327 --> 28:52.693
Don't touch me, okay? Don't touch me.

28:52.695 --> 28:54.074
What is wrong with you?
What is wrong with you?

28:54.099 --> 28:55.982
Oh, my God. Don't put
your hands on my body.

28:56.007 --> 28:58.041
(indistinct grunting and mumbling)

28:58.066 --> 29:00.058
(groaning)

29:00.083 --> 29:02.083
Is that... is that the Manny?

29:02.108 --> 29:04.160
Ow! My face...

29:04.185 --> 29:06.485
Kevin? Hey, Kevin?

29:06.510 --> 29:08.476
- You're all right, man?
- Hey, Seth.

29:08.501 --> 29:11.465
Do you... want me to call someone?

29:13.573 --> 29:15.972
- Oh. Oh, it's, uh...
- (camera shutter clicks)

29:16.044 --> 29:17.605
No.

29:19.722 --> 29:21.035
This is my brother.

29:21.060 --> 29:23.110
Oh. Hey, man.

29:23.438 --> 29:25.020
Hey, Seth Meyers.

29:25.045 --> 29:26.662
- Okay.
- Yeah.

29:26.687 --> 29:29.379
(distant siren wailing)

29:29.404 --> 29:31.788
- No. You know what? Let's go.
- Yeah.

29:31.813 --> 29:33.429
I'm still black. Come
on, let's go. Yup, yup.

29:33.454 --> 29:36.019
(grunts) Let's get the hell out of here.

29:38.348 --> 29:41.550
I'm sorry I couldn't help more
with moving the heavy stuff.

29:41.575 --> 29:43.347
That's okay.

29:45.071 --> 29:47.879
Did you know I grew up in a
house with 14 people in it?

29:47.904 --> 29:49.160
Hmm.

29:49.843 --> 29:55.425
My parents, four
siblings, aunts, cousins,

29:56.166 --> 29:57.058
three bedrooms.

29:57.083 --> 30:00.254
- How many bathrooms?
- One.

30:00.602 --> 30:02.685
Oh, my gosh,

30:02.710 --> 30:05.386
when I was young, all I did
was dream of living alone.

30:06.710 --> 30:10.168
- Like some hippie life, you know?
- (chuckles)

30:10.193 --> 30:12.743
Like in some artist loft downtown.

30:14.059 --> 30:15.683
No husband.

30:16.403 --> 30:18.403
Definitely no kids.

30:19.273 --> 30:20.636
So what happened?

30:20.661 --> 30:22.230
I met your damn son.

30:22.255 --> 30:24.847
(laughs) One look in his eyes,

30:24.872 --> 30:27.316
he ruined everything. (laughs)

30:30.870 --> 30:33.487
Me, I pretty much always lived alone.

30:33.512 --> 30:35.175
Hmm.

30:35.961 --> 30:37.294
Now I have Randall.

30:38.472 --> 30:39.941
And you.

30:40.832 --> 30:42.244
And the girls

30:42.246 --> 30:45.566
to fall asleep to, wake up to every day.

30:47.021 --> 30:48.894
I hope that's a good thing.

30:48.919 --> 30:50.293
Mostly.

30:53.288 --> 30:55.822
Makes me feel sad to die.

31:07.617 --> 31:10.316
I love it when there's
a new moon like this.

31:13.457 --> 31:16.742
"Splendid against the
night, the searchlights...

31:17.002 --> 31:20.574
BOTH: ... the tracers' arcs,
and the red flare of bombs."

31:22.441 --> 31:23.974
How do you know that?

31:24.613 --> 31:26.621
It's in this book of poems

31:26.623 --> 31:28.925
that Randall's had since he was a baby.

31:29.277 --> 31:32.311
(chuckling): Oh, yeah, that's right.

31:32.336 --> 31:35.284
The one I gave Rebecca back in the day.

31:39.269 --> 31:40.441
Oh.

31:41.139 --> 31:42.566
What?

31:42.973 --> 31:44.769
What'd you say? I'm
feeling a little tired,

31:44.794 --> 31:45.816
Beth, I think I'll...

31:45.841 --> 31:47.374
Oh, hell no, you ain't
cancering your way

31:47.399 --> 31:48.565
out of this one, old man.

31:48.590 --> 31:50.030
- (William stammering)
- You better talk.

31:55.579 --> 31:56.912
(warning beeps)

32:10.601 --> 32:12.384
(door chimes)

32:13.504 --> 32:14.703
(alarm chirps)

32:28.284 --> 32:29.583
(plastic bag rustling)

32:35.875 --> 32:38.091
(rustling continues)

32:47.298 --> 32:48.464
(sighs)

33:15.675 --> 33:18.256
Get your asses in the car.

33:18.312 --> 33:20.613
We're gonna talk big-time at home.

33:27.332 --> 33:29.382
(engine starts)

33:59.835 --> 34:01.669
You're right.

34:02.389 --> 34:04.005
Mom did favor me.

34:06.283 --> 34:07.918
She did.

34:08.679 --> 34:10.433
Showered me with attention.

34:10.458 --> 34:12.386
Took my side more often than not.

34:13.992 --> 34:15.992
And I ate every bit of her love up.

34:17.628 --> 34:19.324
Ate it up like Pac-Man.

34:19.349 --> 34:20.956
(laughs softly)

34:21.804 --> 34:23.081
You know why?

34:25.643 --> 34:28.199
Because the one person
I wanted it from the mo...

34:35.270 --> 34:37.987
You know, back there with those people,

34:38.614 --> 34:40.418
it's the first time in 36 years

34:40.443 --> 34:42.909
you've said the words,
"He's my brother."

34:45.621 --> 34:48.373
- Come on, Randall, that can't be...
- Claiming me.

34:51.085 --> 34:52.418
My brother.

35:05.379 --> 35:07.045
Well, then, that really sucks.

35:15.247 --> 35:18.870
Rebecca has known who you
were for Randall's entire life?

35:18.895 --> 35:19.944
Yes, that's right.

35:19.946 --> 35:21.779
And she never told him?

35:21.781 --> 35:23.397
- I don't know, Beth.
- Lied to him,

35:23.399 --> 35:25.184
when he asked. Huh.

35:25.485 --> 35:26.484
I got to tell him.

35:26.486 --> 35:27.485
No. No, no, no, no.

35:27.487 --> 35:28.869
Beth, you can't do that.

35:28.871 --> 35:29.987
Oh, "Beth you can't do that"?

35:29.989 --> 35:31.442
This is my husband.

35:31.791 --> 35:32.873
This is my marriage.

35:32.875 --> 35:35.626
I know, but the closeness
he has with his mom,

35:35.628 --> 35:38.045
you tell him this, it'll destroy it.

35:38.070 --> 35:39.686
(door closes)

35:45.847 --> 35:47.546
Whoa, someone's high.

35:51.144 --> 35:52.512
Good night.

35:54.117 --> 35:56.284
- Night.
- Good night.

35:58.684 --> 36:01.152
Uh...

36:01.592 --> 36:03.875
You and my wife got high together?

36:06.993 --> 36:08.801
That's pretty cool.

36:12.949 --> 36:14.949
(chuckles) Good for you.

36:14.951 --> 36:16.784
All right, I'm gonna head up to bed.

36:16.786 --> 36:19.370
Not that way; she moved you.

36:19.372 --> 36:21.422
What do you mean, she moved
me? She moved me where?

36:31.968 --> 36:33.903
(sighs) (laughs)

36:34.692 --> 36:36.437
Oh, back in the basement.

36:36.754 --> 36:38.909
- No, we'll move you back upstairs.
- No, come... hey, listen.

36:38.934 --> 36:40.775
I should be getting out
of your hair soon anyway.

36:40.777 --> 36:42.893
You know, until then, this is
actually a pretty sweet set-up.

36:42.895 --> 36:44.145
There's no bathroom down here.

36:44.147 --> 36:45.980
I can walk a flight of stairs.

36:49.622 --> 36:52.214
(sighs) Well, uh... (clicks tongue)

36:52.239 --> 36:54.582
- It's been a day.
- Yeah.

36:55.572 --> 36:56.905
Night.

36:58.044 --> 36:59.293
Night.

37:02.715 --> 37:05.216
- Hey, uh, Randall.
- Hmm?

37:08.471 --> 37:10.950
Uh, do you want to...

37:11.390 --> 37:13.641
Do you want to hang out down
here for little bit with me?

37:13.643 --> 37:16.590
We could, uh, turn
the TV on or something.

37:18.645 --> 37:20.825
Uh-huh. For a little while.

37:20.850 --> 37:22.683
- Yeah?
- Why not?

37:23.068 --> 37:25.202
- Cool.
- Yeah.

37:33.247 --> 37:35.446
Uh, Rebecca, this is Beth.

37:35.622 --> 37:38.870
Yeah, um, so William just told
me something really interesting

37:38.895 --> 37:40.751
about the two of you.

37:40.753 --> 37:44.104
So, yeah, I'm gonna need
you to call me back, okay?

37:44.129 --> 37:45.539
Right away.

37:45.541 --> 37:47.374
As soon as you get this message.
