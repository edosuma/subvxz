NARRATOR:<i> Previously on </i>Boston Legal...

00:02.293 --> 00:04.004
-I still run this place.
-No, you don't.

00:04.087 --> 00:05.797
You just want to run around,
drop your pants,

00:05.880 --> 00:07.298
<i>shoot people, date a hooker.</i>

00:07.382 --> 00:09.718
This behavior will not
be tolerated much longer.

00:10.135 --> 00:11.011
I will fire you.

00:11.094 --> 00:12.345
My daughter was murdered.

00:12.429 --> 00:13.471
I would like to kill this man

00:13.555 --> 00:16.182
and be found not guilty
by reason of temporary insanity.

00:16.266 --> 00:17.767
Did you report that woman
to the police yet?

00:17.851 --> 00:18.852
-Would you?
-DENNY: Probably not.

00:18.935 --> 00:20.228
She already killed him.

00:20.311 --> 00:22.230
-You expect to get away with this?
-He had it coming.

00:22.313 --> 00:24.649
-You're not sounding very insane.
-I'm better now.

00:24.733 --> 00:26.609
It was temporary insanity.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.778
Sean Harmon viciously killed her daughter.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.989
And he got exactly what he deserved.

00:35.994 --> 00:39.164
-(elevator bell dings)
-(indistinct chattering)

00:39.247 --> 00:41.082
-Mr. Shore, any comments?
-(reporters clamoring)

00:41.166 --> 00:42.792
Sir, won't temporary insanity
be tough to prove?

00:43.585 --> 00:44.544
Excuse us.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.005
This might be a good opportunity
for a sound bite.

00:47.088 --> 00:51.092
-The time for sound bites has passed.
-(clamoring continues)

00:52.761 --> 00:56.389
It was a typical day in a
typical office place in America.

00:56.765 --> 00:59.768
But what would happen next
was anything but typical.

00:59.851 --> 01:03.980
Uh, Miss Winters, just tell us.
Try not to channel Stone Phillips.

01:04.606 --> 01:06.316
Yes, Your Honor. (clears throat)

01:06.399 --> 01:11.029
As I said, I saw that woman enter,
and I knew who she was.

01:11.112 --> 01:14.115
Let the record reflect that the witness
has indicated the defendant.

01:14.199 --> 01:15.950
WINTERS: I'd followed Sean's trial.

01:16.034 --> 01:17.660
The news had covered it extensively,

01:17.744 --> 01:19.120
and her face was prominent,

01:19.204 --> 01:21.039
being that she was the mother
of the victim.

01:21.122 --> 01:23.458
Oh, she was a cool woman on camera,

01:23.541 --> 01:28.171
-with a soft gentility that belied--
-Uh, Miss Winters?

01:29.005 --> 01:29.839
(clears throat) Yes.

01:30.882 --> 01:32.550
As I said, she entered,

01:32.634 --> 01:33.927
and she walked toward Sean,

01:34.010 --> 01:36.971
who was in the office
right beside my desk!

01:37.055 --> 01:41.684
WINTERS:<i> She didn't seem to be upset.</i>
<i>In fact, she seemed calm, cool.</i>

01:42.519 --> 01:45.021
<i>As she got to Sean's office, Sean said,</i>
<i>"What are you doing?"</i>

01:45.688 --> 01:49.692
<i>And she said, "I've come to kill you,</i>
<i>Sean. Is this a bad time?"</i>

01:49.776 --> 01:51.736
<i>Just like that, "Is this a bad time?"</i>

01:51.820 --> 01:55.115
<i>And then I saw it.</i>
<i>There in her hand, a gun.</i>

01:55.198 --> 01:58.034
Stop! Your Honor, this is hearsay.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.744
If the witness is to be believed,

01:59.828 --> 02:00.995
this wasn't an excited utterance
from our client.

02:01.079 --> 02:04.374
It was a declaration against interest.
Hearsay--

02:04.457 --> 02:06.251
Our client already admitted she shot him.

02:06.334 --> 02:07.710
And she's claiming insanity.

02:08.044 --> 02:10.672
Testimony of her demeanor and
state of mind are relevant, Your Honor.

02:11.422 --> 02:15.093
Objection overruled.
You may continue, Miss Winters.

02:15.301 --> 02:16.136
Gladly.

02:16.845 --> 02:20.640
Anyway, it was the most horrible thing
I'd ever experienced.

02:20.723 --> 02:22.308
WINTERS:<i> There's Sean lying on the floor,</i>

02:22.392 --> 02:23.893
<i>blood gushing from his head--</i>

02:23.977 --> 02:25.979
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You skipped ahead.

02:26.396 --> 02:27.897
Back up to before he was shot.

02:28.356 --> 02:29.941
Oh, I-I'm terribly sorry.

02:30.024 --> 02:32.527
I, I get ahead of myself
when I get excited.

02:33.361 --> 02:36.906
Anyway, where was I? Oh, yes.

02:37.198 --> 02:40.410
<i>She walked in and said what she said,</i>
<i>then raised the gun.</i>

02:40.827 --> 02:44.873
<i>And she pointed it, calmly.</i>
<i>Her hand was not shaking.</i>

02:45.331 --> 02:47.876
<i>And she said,</i>
<i>"You have five seconds to live.</i>

02:48.626 --> 02:51.629
<i>I'd give you ten,</i>
<i>but we really can't keep hell waiting."</i>

02:52.172 --> 02:54.507
<i>And then she just pulled the trigger.</i>

02:54.591 --> 02:57.427
The bullet hit him right between the eyes,
and he dropped.

02:57.927 --> 03:01.222
It was a cold-blooded, vicious execution.

03:01.306 --> 03:03.057
It was awful just to think about it.

03:05.059 --> 03:05.977
Shall I tell it again?

03:09.189 --> 03:12.609

03:44.390 --> 03:46.726
-Oh. Please, come in.
-Sure.

03:47.310 --> 03:51.022
I'm thrilled, actually,
and a little stunned.

03:51.105 --> 03:53.024
I think I've worked here six years.

03:53.107 --> 03:55.735
I don't believe
I've actually been in your office.

03:55.818 --> 04:00.031
Actually, I'm afraid the circumstances
of this meeting are not pleasant.

04:03.743 --> 04:04.786
We're letting you go.

04:06.037 --> 04:07.413
What? Why?

04:07.497 --> 04:09.415
It's not that your performance
hasn't been good.

04:09.499 --> 04:10.625
I'm told you do fine, fine work.

04:10.708 --> 04:14.003
But since partnership
is not in your future,

04:14.379 --> 04:18.132
we prefer to let those associates go
rather than mislead them.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.050
It's only fair.

04:19.550 --> 04:22.345
Would you mind telling me
why partnership's not in my future?

04:22.679 --> 04:24.472
Not at all. You're fat.

04:25.431 --> 04:26.266
Excuse me?

04:26.349 --> 04:29.936
We can't have fat people working
at Crane, Poole &amp; Schmidt.

04:30.603 --> 04:31.437
That's all.

04:31.521 --> 04:35.316
And, um, seriously,
thank you for your past work. I mean that.

04:37.277 --> 04:41.614
-So I'm being fired because I'm fat?
-Yes. Off you go now.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.291
So if I was thin,
I-- I'd still have my job?

04:51.374 --> 04:53.668
Hell, if you were thin,
I'd probably try and have sex with you.

04:53.751 --> 04:54.585
You did try.

04:55.503 --> 04:57.005
-Really?
-Last week.

04:57.714 --> 04:58.881
Did we have it?

04:59.799 --> 05:01.009
Doesn't matter. Look.

05:01.676 --> 05:04.429
I can't let my personal feelings
get in the way.

05:04.512 --> 05:05.555
I have to think of the firm.

05:05.638 --> 05:09.350
No tubsters at C, P &amp; S. Off you go now.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.187
(mouthing)

05:15.815 --> 05:17.734
-(phone beeps)
-Security, please.

05:30.663 --> 05:33.666
It was a kind of dissociative state
that we call "automatism."

05:34.042 --> 05:35.126
-Automatism?
-Yes.

05:35.209 --> 05:38.087
Basically, Miss Kelly
went into a form of automatic pilot.

05:38.504 --> 05:39.881
DOCTOR: We see it with battered wives.

05:40.298 --> 05:44.218
The abuse triggers this extreme,
almost psychotic reaction in the brain.

05:44.302 --> 05:47.430
Here, the abuse
was obviously the murder of her child,

05:48.181 --> 05:50.183
then seeing the killer set free.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.311
-She's fine now?
-Seems so, yes.

05:53.644 --> 05:57.315
And was she on automatic pilot during all
the planning stages of this crime?

05:57.398 --> 05:59.025
I can't really know. I didn't examine her.

05:59.108 --> 06:00.568
When you did examine her,

06:00.651 --> 06:02.987
after the shooting,
was she on automatic pilot then?

06:03.780 --> 06:05.740
No. She had regained control.

06:05.823 --> 06:08.576
And you know
that she was on automatic pilot

06:08.659 --> 06:11.371
during the murder
based on what information?

06:11.788 --> 06:14.207
What she felt and experienced
at the time of the shooting.

06:14.665 --> 06:17.293
Who told you what she felt
and experienced?

06:20.421 --> 06:21.255
She did.

06:27.929 --> 06:29.013
(elevator bell dings)

06:31.057 --> 06:32.058
Thank you.

06:35.561 --> 06:37.105
-Hello?
-Hello.

06:37.188 --> 06:40.650
My name is Leigh Swift. L-E-I-G-H.

06:40.733 --> 06:43.111
I only point this out
because it is misspelled

06:43.194 --> 06:44.737
67 percent of the time.

06:45.154 --> 06:48.658
And I am here today in hopes
of securing legal counsel,

06:48.741 --> 06:50.993
-preferably from--
-Jerry Espenson.

06:51.452 --> 06:53.538
-How did you know?
-Shot in the dark.

06:53.621 --> 06:55.832
-(Jerry squeals)
-Oh, impeccable timing.

07:02.296 --> 07:04.132
-Hello.
-Hello.

07:04.549 --> 07:05.550
High-fives all around.

07:07.218 --> 07:08.428
No?

07:08.511 --> 07:10.888
Jerry, this is Leigh. I'll get you
the correct spelling on that later.

07:10.972 --> 07:14.016
Could you perhaps escort her
out of the common area?

07:14.100 --> 07:16.227
(inhales) Let's go to my office.

07:18.312 --> 07:21.274
Hello, Mr. Sack. I just wanted to come
and say good-bye.

07:21.357 --> 07:23.234
Good-bye? Who the hell are you?

07:23.317 --> 07:26.571
My name is Nancy Wilding.
I'm an associate. I was fired.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.657
Denny Crane fired me because I'm fat.

07:30.575 --> 07:31.993
-He did what?
-Yes.

07:32.076 --> 07:34.537
-So it's good-bye.
-Wait. No. Ho, whoa, whoa.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.456
No. No, you're not fired.
I'll talk to Denny.

07:36.539 --> 07:40.376
(chuckles) Oh, if only it were that easy.
You see, I've been damaged.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.129
And I've hit the lottery.
We'll see you all in court.

07:45.381 --> 07:48.176
-Are you out of your mind?
-Why does everybody ask me that?

07:48.259 --> 07:52.138
For God's sakes, Denny, you cannot fire
somebody just because they're fat!

07:52.221 --> 07:56.017
Never mind the indecency of it.
Can't you see that as a lawyer?

07:56.476 --> 07:58.769
And you know what?
She's poised to make noise over this.

07:59.145 --> 08:03.608
And you, personally, you'll be filleted
in the news. Did you think about that?

08:03.691 --> 08:05.943
Well, let me tell you something, Sack.

08:06.027 --> 08:08.863
It doesn't matter what people are saying,

08:09.989 --> 08:11.616
as long as they talk about you.

08:16.537 --> 08:20.583
I've been to six other lawyers.
None of them would take my case.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.793
But all of them asked
if I was related to you.

08:23.044 --> 08:25.338
Perhaps you could tell me why you're here?

08:26.214 --> 08:30.218
I've lost my lover.
His name is Gebrauchkasten.

08:30.301 --> 08:33.638
He was forcibly taken against his will...
(clicks tongue) ...by force.

08:35.681 --> 08:37.475
Have you filed a police report?

08:37.808 --> 08:39.644
Oh, the police have been dismissive.

08:40.353 --> 08:44.774
I suspect they're discriminating against
Gebrauchkasten based on his ethnicity.

08:45.399 --> 08:47.276
I really doubt they'd ignore
a kidnapping case.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.361
Here he is.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.700
LEIGH: That's Gebrauchkasten.

08:55.618 --> 08:57.954
His name is German for "utility box."

08:58.871 --> 08:59.914
This box...

09:00.540 --> 09:01.999
Is my lover. (clicks tongue)

09:04.585 --> 09:07.547
(reporters clamoring)

09:11.467 --> 09:14.804
Nobody here believes
you were actually crazy.

09:14.887 --> 09:17.265
It was revenge. I know it.

09:17.765 --> 09:20.643
You know it. The jury knows it.

09:21.185 --> 09:26.649
Our insanity defense is simply a pretext
to allow the jury to let you go.

09:26.732 --> 09:28.859
But first they have to want you
to go free.

09:28.943 --> 09:32.238
For that to happen, they have to like you.
And for that to happen...

09:32.947 --> 09:35.616
the jury has to feel what you feel.

09:36.033 --> 09:37.285
But I don't feel.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.914
After my daughter was killed,
I stopped feeling.

09:43.624 --> 09:45.084
It's how I survive.

09:45.167 --> 09:47.837
Well, it won't be how you survive prison,
which is where you're headed

09:47.920 --> 09:50.840
if the jury doesn't see a human being
sitting in that chair.

09:51.215 --> 09:53.718
-I'll discuss it with God.
-Look at me.

09:55.344 --> 09:57.305
If this jury thinks for a moment

09:57.388 --> 09:59.265
that you're pulling one over on them,
you're gone.

10:00.516 --> 10:05.187
You need to be unaffectedly,
emotionally forthright and sincere.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.778
I honestly don't know if I can do that.

10:30.463 --> 10:34.425
After Hannah was killed,
all I had to grab hold of

10:35.259 --> 10:40.014
was this quest to see her killer convicted
and sentenced.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.725
Do you remember what you felt

10:42.808 --> 10:45.853
when you heard the verdict
of "not guilty" read?

10:45.936 --> 10:47.688
I don't think I do, really.

10:48.939 --> 10:50.107
I went numb.

10:50.566 --> 10:52.443
KELLY: At some point, I lost myself.

10:53.069 --> 10:57.239
I started to pray, because I often find
consolation in my faith.

10:57.448 --> 11:00.159
And one day...

11:01.285 --> 11:02.370
I heard a voice.

11:02.703 --> 11:05.206
-A voice?
-Yes. It wasn't my own.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.709
And it said, "You must kill Sean Harmon."

11:09.669 --> 11:11.587
You didn't recognize this voice?

11:12.088 --> 11:16.634
No. But for whatever reason,
I became convinced that it was God.

11:16.717 --> 11:19.720
You thought God was telling you
to kill Sean Harmon.

11:19.804 --> 11:21.597
I know how crazy it sounds,

11:21.972 --> 11:25.226
but at the time,
I was reading a lot of the Bible.

11:25.685 --> 11:29.897
And so many of the verses
I would hear in this voice.

11:30.231 --> 11:34.402
Leviticus, "He that killeth a man,
he shall be put to death."

11:34.485 --> 11:39.115
Exodus, "He that smiteth a man, so that
he die, he surely shall be put to death."

11:39.198 --> 11:41.450
I kept hearing this over and over,

11:42.868 --> 11:47.373
(voice breaking) and I became convinced
that my daughter's soul...

11:54.088 --> 11:56.507
would rest only with vengeance.

11:58.384 --> 12:01.345
Sean Harmon had to die.
It was up to me to kill him.

12:02.722 --> 12:06.100
I would have to be the one to avenge
my baby's death.

12:09.895 --> 12:10.896
(chokes softly)

12:13.441 --> 12:14.775
(sobbing quietly)

12:19.405 --> 12:20.448
What do you...

12:21.407 --> 12:23.909
remember about the day you...

12:25.619 --> 12:27.037
shot Sean Harmon?

12:28.080 --> 12:32.209
I remember driving to his place of work,
approaching him.

12:33.753 --> 12:34.920
I didn't feel scared.

12:36.380 --> 12:38.007
I recall aiming the gun...

12:39.175 --> 12:40.384
and shooting him.

12:40.926 --> 12:44.096
And I'm ashamed to admit it...

12:46.015 --> 12:49.101
but I remember that it felt joyous.

12:50.311 --> 12:51.937
-Joyous?
-KELLY: Yes.

12:52.021 --> 12:56.525
Between his living a free man,
and his dying,

12:57.067 --> 13:00.237
it felt more moral for him to be dead.

13:00.571 --> 13:05.618
And I felt like I was somehow carrying out
God's word, and...

13:07.703 --> 13:09.079
it was joyous.

13:19.840 --> 13:23.135
"Objectophilia, a type of neosexuality

13:23.219 --> 13:27.264
indicative of a modern trend away
from human-to-human intimacy."

13:27.890 --> 13:29.225
Sounds like a coping mechanism,

13:29.308 --> 13:31.310
a way to compensate
for a lack of human affection.

13:31.393 --> 13:32.436
I suppose we can all relate to that a bit.

13:32.895 --> 13:36.148
So what do I do? She's in love with a box.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.526
-Well, what do you want to do, Jerry?
-Well...

13:39.902 --> 13:40.903
she's...

13:41.654 --> 13:42.822
a very nice lady.

13:43.572 --> 13:46.200
I suppose I would like to help her.

13:46.867 --> 13:50.329
-Do that then.
-She has no legal case.

13:50.412 --> 13:53.707
This is ridiculous even for this firm.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.085
Mmm.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.003
Maybe you could locate her lover.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.132
(music playing on video game)

14:02.216 --> 14:04.176
WOMAN:<i> You better hope my pimp</i>
<i>doesn't catch you!</i>

14:04.260 --> 14:06.929
<i>Try me. There's nothing I won't do.</i>

14:07.596 --> 14:10.808
<i>For the right price, I'm all yours.</i>

14:10.891 --> 14:13.060
-Hello, Denny. Busy?
-Can't you tell?

14:13.143 --> 14:15.145
I'm in the middle of kidnapping a hooker.

14:16.146 --> 14:17.648
May I speak with you a second?

14:21.277 --> 14:24.238
-(music stops)
-Actually, I was on my way out.

14:24.822 --> 14:26.490
Care to ride the elevator with me?

14:26.574 --> 14:28.492
You're just dying to get me
in an elevator, aren't you?

14:28.576 --> 14:29.785
It crossed my mind.

14:30.536 --> 14:33.330
Carl asked me to give you a hand
with this Nancy Wilding matter.

14:33.414 --> 14:35.416
Oh, that's why you're here,
to give me a hand.

14:35.499 --> 14:36.625
Know what I'd like to do, Denny?

14:37.543 --> 14:39.837
I'd like to get Nancy Wilding
and her lawyer in,

14:39.920 --> 14:43.757
officially offer her her job back,
coupled with a heartfelt apology.

14:43.841 --> 14:46.635
Why should you apologize?
You didn't do anything wrong.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.305
-I was thinking it would come from you.
-That's a no.

14:50.097 --> 14:53.976
Denny, I don't want to be bothered
with this case any more than you do.

14:55.060 --> 14:58.606
Let's you and I make it go away together.
Can we do that, Denny?

14:59.982 --> 15:02.276
You and I together?

15:06.155 --> 15:09.033
Did you ever mention to anyone
before killing Sean Harmon

15:09.450 --> 15:11.327
that you were getting messages from God?

15:12.036 --> 15:14.163
-No.
-You claim to be a religious person.

15:14.246 --> 15:15.873
Did you discuss this with clergy?

15:17.541 --> 15:19.501
-No.
-You're getting messages from God.

15:19.919 --> 15:23.714
You don't talk to your own priest,
you just order a gun?

15:24.298 --> 15:26.675
Not the actions of a sane person, I admit.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.552
But you're sane now, right?

15:29.261 --> 15:32.556
In fact, when examined
by court-appointed psychiatrists

15:32.640 --> 15:35.267
to determine your competency
to stand trial,

15:35.351 --> 15:39.104
they found you sane,
this just 36 hours after her crime.

15:39.188 --> 15:41.398
-Objection.
-It seems like such a small,

15:41.482 --> 15:42.900
convenient window of insanity.

15:42.983 --> 15:45.110
-Objection!
-Objection sustained.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.321
The jury will disregard that.

15:48.364 --> 15:53.410
So, as I understand it, you know now
that God was not speaking to you?

15:54.078 --> 15:56.830
Yes. I was probably projecting.

15:57.373 --> 15:58.916
KELLY: I wanted Sean Harmon dead.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.126
It was me, but...

16:01.502 --> 16:04.922
I didn't think I could reconcile murder
with my sense of morality.

16:05.547 --> 16:09.718
So my subconscious somehow found a way
to make it God's word,

16:10.594 --> 16:13.013
so that I could maintain
my moral esteem...

16:14.056 --> 16:15.808
and still kill Sean Harmon.

16:27.069 --> 16:30.698
It was one of those answers that could
either win the day or bury us.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.700
Well, she seems to know exactly
what she's doing.

16:32.783 --> 16:34.243
I'd give her the benefit of the doubt.

16:34.743 --> 16:36.078
Let's talk about you, Denny.

16:36.161 --> 16:37.621
You certainly knew what you were doing

16:37.705 --> 16:40.374
when you fired Nancy Wilding
for being fat.

16:41.417 --> 16:42.251
What's going on?

16:43.377 --> 16:46.964
Are you retaliating because she rejected
your sexual advances?

16:47.047 --> 16:50.050
Hell, if I had a nickel for every girl
that turned me down, I'd...

16:50.551 --> 16:52.928
-Actually, I do.
-What is it then?

16:53.012 --> 16:55.514
Is it just another way
to be the center of attention?

17:01.478 --> 17:03.063
I should be on that case.

17:03.147 --> 17:06.734
I should be in that courtroom
with you and Patrice Kelly,

17:06.817 --> 17:08.736
not in my office...

17:09.611 --> 17:11.405
kidnapping hookers.

17:12.489 --> 17:14.116
On the TV.

17:19.621 --> 17:21.540
-Denny...
-(softly) Don't.

17:23.959 --> 17:25.002
Just don't.

17:26.962 --> 17:29.631
You need to let Lorraine
make this case go away.

17:29.715 --> 17:32.760
I'll do what I want.

17:33.635 --> 17:34.636
Fine.

17:48.734 --> 17:54.281
You're representing a woman
who is in love with a utility box.

17:54.364 --> 17:56.325
-Is that right, Jerry?
-Mm.

17:57.034 --> 17:59.620
-I'm sorry?
-Yes, Mr. Sack. It's right.

18:00.120 --> 18:03.332
I'm representing a woman
who's in love with a utility box.

18:05.125 --> 18:06.960
Something tells me you're involved.

18:07.044 --> 18:09.379
I'm not, actually,
other than to encourage Jerry.

18:09.463 --> 18:10.839
-I think it's brilliant.
-(squeals) Brilliant!

18:12.674 --> 18:14.009
I think the law, at its noblest,

18:14.093 --> 18:15.552
is used to protect the weakest

18:15.636 --> 18:17.304
and most vulnerable members
of our society.

18:17.638 --> 18:20.432
The client here is an objectophile,
a fragile one at that.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.726
Every other law firm
summarily rejected her.

18:22.810 --> 18:25.395
How wonderful that this firm endeavors
to prioritize compassion

18:25.479 --> 18:27.356
and humanity over profit.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.608
It positively warms
the cockles of my heart.

18:30.192 --> 18:32.444
Jerry's off to meet with the developer.
Perhaps you'd care to join?

18:33.070 --> 18:34.905
I'm sure your own cockles
could use a jolly.

18:37.991 --> 18:42.412
Well, I... I can't speak as to whether God
spoke to this woman,

18:42.496 --> 18:46.458
but my view is he would certainly forgive
her for her actions.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.127
For killing Sean Harmon?

18:48.210 --> 18:51.213
The Lord's powers of forgiveness
are without limit.

18:51.296 --> 18:54.258
And in this case,
there's also the eye-for-an-eye principle.

18:54.591 --> 18:56.051
That justifies killing somebody.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.762
The phrase is to be found
in the Old Testament,

18:58.846 --> 19:00.931
and I believe it speaks for itself.

19:01.515 --> 19:02.641
WHITNEY: What about the New Testament?

19:03.267 --> 19:05.394
Jesus says, "Turn the other cheek,"
does he not?

19:06.270 --> 19:09.231
Well, my reading of that is,
Jesus was voicing

19:09.314 --> 19:12.484
a very personal view on how a saintly
individual should act.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.779
I don't interpret
that as condemning revenge.

19:16.864 --> 19:21.243
So you, a man of the cloth,
don't believe that all human life is holy?

19:21.743 --> 19:23.370
I do. I also believe,

19:23.453 --> 19:27.583
"Whoever sheds the blood of man,
by man shall his blood be shed."

19:28.041 --> 19:29.209
Genesis.

19:29.960 --> 19:33.005
I've studied Judeo-Christian teachings
for 33 years.

19:33.088 --> 19:36.550
I consider myself both a Biblical
and a Talmudic scholar,

19:36.884 --> 19:41.180
and I found Father Maher's testimony
to be strikingly without merit.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.892
-Because?
-The "eye for an eye" verse in the Bible

19:44.975 --> 19:47.686
suggests a limitation on retribution.

19:47.769 --> 19:50.689
It is forbidden to take two eyes for one,

19:50.772 --> 19:53.567
or, for that matter,
to inflict any punishment

19:53.650 --> 19:54.985
that would exceed the offense.

19:55.068 --> 19:58.405
Yes, but the underlying offense
of Sean Harmon was murder.

19:58.488 --> 20:02.201
Yeah, but even so, it was never meant
to advocate revenge murder.

20:02.284 --> 20:04.328
I mean, consider the words of Jesus.

20:04.411 --> 20:08.248
"If anyone strikes you on the left cheek,
offer him the other as well."

20:08.332 --> 20:11.418
Jesus would never have endorsed
this revenge killing.

20:11.501 --> 20:12.628
He was against vengeance.

20:13.378 --> 20:15.255
Well, except when it came
to believing in him, right?

20:16.506 --> 20:21.053
Mark 16:16. "He that believeth
and is baptized shall be saved,

20:21.136 --> 20:23.597
but he that believeth
not shall be damned."

20:23.680 --> 20:26.516
And damnation, if hell is everything
it's cracked up to be,

20:26.600 --> 20:28.810
is a fate worse than the painful death
that precedes it.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.395
So, according to this guy Mark,

20:30.479 --> 20:33.065
Jesus was okay with vengeance,
wasn't he, Professor?

20:33.148 --> 20:35.943
If I was a Christian, I suppose
I'd be very much offended by that.

20:36.026 --> 20:39.947
But you're a Jew,
and certainly Jews are okay with revenge?

20:40.030 --> 20:41.615
You know something
about Jewish law I don't?

20:41.698 --> 20:44.910
I know that if you cross Israel's borders
without the proper invitation,

20:44.993 --> 20:46.078
the bombs, they go a-bursting.

20:46.161 --> 20:48.914
I know, when Israel kidnapped Eichmann
and hanged him,

20:48.997 --> 20:50.624
Jewish people the world over cheered.

20:50.707 --> 20:54.086
Look. First of all,
Eichmann was responsible for mass murder.

20:54.169 --> 20:56.880
So it's not whether Judaism
supports revenge, but when?

20:57.589 --> 20:58.465
You're offensive.

20:58.548 --> 21:01.927
Really? I was just going to say
the same about you.

21:02.010 --> 21:04.096
Judaism has never been preoccupied
with forgiveness.

21:04.179 --> 21:07.140
"Justice, justice you shall pursue."
That's what the Torah commands.

21:07.224 --> 21:11.603
My client was pursuing justice when she
avenged the death of her only daughter.

21:11.687 --> 21:15.148
What's truly offensive is you sitting high
on your scholarly horse

21:15.232 --> 21:18.694
and suggesting that God, anybody's God,
would condemn her for it.

21:18.777 --> 21:20.570
-Objection.
-I suspect if your child was murdered,

21:20.654 --> 21:22.197
had it been your child's murderer
who went free...

21:22.281 --> 21:23.448
Objection.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.200
-...you wouldn't be pontificating
about forgiveness.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.118
-Objection, Your Honor!
-When's the last time your kids

21:26.201 --> 21:28.036
-got bludgeoned to death?
-Mr. Shore.

21:37.713 --> 21:39.756
MAN:
This is very difficult for me to grasp.

21:39.840 --> 21:43.010
JERRY: It's very simple.
You relocated the box.

21:43.093 --> 21:44.970
We would simply like
to get possession of it.

21:45.053 --> 21:46.471
No. That much I got.

21:46.555 --> 21:48.974
It was the part about her
being in love with it.

21:49.057 --> 21:50.350
(clicks tongue)

21:51.310 --> 21:54.479
Of course, my client's predilection
must strike you as unconventional.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.898
But I would nevertheless
ask you to respect

21:56.982 --> 22:01.028
she has found a meaningful relationship
that works for her.

22:02.821 --> 22:04.948
-With a box.
-I'm an objectophile.

22:05.032 --> 22:08.702
We were hoping that perhaps the person
involved in the item's removal

22:08.785 --> 22:10.078
could help track it down.

22:10.787 --> 22:14.708
Well, I'm sorry.
I believe the box has been destroyed.

22:16.835 --> 22:18.253
When you say "destroyed"...

22:24.509 --> 22:26.636
That's all of him?

22:27.804 --> 22:29.264
I'm told he's all there.

22:31.475 --> 22:32.934
It's not the same.

22:38.023 --> 22:41.610
Leigh,
have you thought of getting counseling?

22:43.653 --> 22:45.822
You must think I'm a rather sick person.

22:46.698 --> 22:48.450
No. I don't.

22:49.117 --> 22:55.374
There are many people
who find inanimate objects desirable.

22:57.459 --> 22:58.418
I had...

22:59.628 --> 23:01.213
a life-size doll.

23:03.632 --> 23:05.550
At least your object had a face.

23:07.010 --> 23:10.305
Oh, she had more than a face.

23:10.889 --> 23:13.392
I'd given her a personality,
a sense of humor.

23:14.017 --> 23:16.728
I'd even debate politics
with her on occasion.

23:16.812 --> 23:18.063
(chuckles)

23:20.899 --> 23:24.111
Most of it is about fear of intimacy
and trust with a real person.

23:24.569 --> 23:29.825
I read one expert. He says we've become
such a socially isolated society,

23:29.908 --> 23:31.993
what, with computers and so forth,

23:32.327 --> 23:35.122
With so many socially-isolated
individuals,

23:35.205 --> 23:38.625
the rise of objectophilia
is not altogether surprising.

23:39.543 --> 23:41.711
-Are you listening?
-What?

23:42.796 --> 23:44.756
Oh, yes. Sorry.

23:44.840 --> 23:48.844
It's just that your clock radio reminded
me of one of my exes for a second.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.472
I think you can achieve

23:52.973 --> 23:57.310
an intimate and trusting relationship
with a real person.

23:57.769 --> 24:00.397
It's very terrifying. I know.

24:01.356 --> 24:04.025
But I think you should give
real people a try.

24:06.611 --> 24:07.612
(sighs)

24:14.161 --> 24:16.955
Jerry, thank you for everything.

24:17.956 --> 24:19.583
For not laughing at me...

24:20.959 --> 24:22.002
for...

24:22.919 --> 24:25.505
Well, you're a very compassionate man.

24:26.339 --> 24:29.843
-If there's anything I can do for you.
-Well, you've been so kind.

24:31.511 --> 24:34.181
It might be very hard for me
to be alone tonight.

24:35.348 --> 24:37.559
Oh. Um, well...

24:41.438 --> 24:42.481
Oh!

24:45.358 --> 24:47.027
-Take it.
-Are you sure?

24:47.110 --> 24:48.695
-Please.
-I'll bring it back.

24:48.778 --> 24:50.071
Just something to hold.

25:00.373 --> 25:02.751
We're officially offering
Nancy her job back.

25:03.376 --> 25:06.379
Rejected. She's not coming back
to a firm of fat bigots.

25:06.713 --> 25:09.549
And we'll offer 25,000
to cover hurt feelings.

25:09.633 --> 25:10.800
Also rejected.

25:10.884 --> 25:12.594
Are you this hostile in bed?
'Cause I like that.

25:13.512 --> 25:16.473
-Denny.
-Look. I really am sorry for what I said.

25:17.390 --> 25:20.268
But let's face it. We live in a very
cosmetic world these days,

25:20.352 --> 25:23.605
and perception so often seems
to count more than substance.

25:23.939 --> 25:27.567
Beauty begets beauty. And what I was
really trying to say was, you're fat.

25:27.984 --> 25:31.238
Keep talking, Mr. Crane. All I hear is,
"Ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching."

25:31.321 --> 25:34.616
Nancy, a jury's not gonna give you money.
Juries like winners.

25:34.699 --> 25:35.742
Look around the room.

25:36.785 --> 25:39.079
Winner. Winner.

25:39.746 --> 25:42.040
Loser. Loser.

25:42.791 --> 25:45.460
Let's review:
Winner, winner. Loser, loser.

25:45.919 --> 25:49.214
Now I'd appreciate it if you'd leave
my conference room before anyone sees you

25:49.297 --> 25:51.383
and confuses you with someone
I'd actually hire.

25:52.300 --> 25:54.844
Off you go now. Take the man-eater
with you. Bye-bye.

26:04.104 --> 26:08.441
<i>The evidence is all in, folks.</i>
<i>It comes down to closing arguments.</i>

26:08.525 --> 26:10.944
<i>We know what the prosecution is gonna say,</i>

26:11.027 --> 26:13.863
<i>but let's talk about the defense.</i>

26:13.947 --> 26:16.992
<i>There is only one argument to make here.</i>

26:17.075 --> 26:18.577
<i>We all know what it is.</i>

26:18.660 --> 26:21.746
<i>The victim here</i>
<i>killed this poor woman's daugh--</i>

26:24.332 --> 26:27.711
-What do you want?
-(sighs) Could you please sit, Denny?

26:33.675 --> 26:36.094
Do you know the reason
I came to the Boston office?

26:36.928 --> 26:39.180
-Shirley.
-That would be one reason, yes.

26:39.264 --> 26:41.349
The other was to...

26:41.850 --> 26:42.726
Well,

26:43.935 --> 26:45.645
wring out some of the madness.

26:45.729 --> 26:50.275
And now we have you,
firing an associate because she's fat.

26:52.360 --> 26:55.905
I'd like to stay and chat, Carl,
but I've got a trial coming up.

26:55.989 --> 26:59.951
And the client can't fire me,
because I'm the client.

27:00.368 --> 27:01.369
Please sit.

27:07.792 --> 27:09.002
(sighs)

27:10.170 --> 27:12.380
-May I share something with you?
-Shirley?

27:12.464 --> 27:13.465
No, not Shirley.

27:14.341 --> 27:17.302
There's a reason your name
comes first on the door.

27:18.219 --> 27:20.805
More than anything else,
this place is you.

27:21.514 --> 27:25.560
If I've come to realize one thing more
than anything since arriving,

27:26.311 --> 27:29.773
it's how much the people who work
at Crane, Poole &amp; Schmidt

27:30.398 --> 27:32.525
so love doing so,

27:33.526 --> 27:36.279
in large part for you.

27:37.614 --> 27:41.618
What you do to yourself, in theory,
is your own business.

27:43.161 --> 27:44.287
But it really isn't.

27:45.914 --> 27:48.500
-(inhales)
-(exhales)

27:57.217 --> 27:58.343
(farts)

28:00.261 --> 28:01.471
Denny Crane.

28:07.977 --> 28:11.231
I don't think I need to persuade you
that the evidence clearly shows

28:11.314 --> 28:13.692
that Patrice Kelly was not insane.

28:13.983 --> 28:17.821
In truth, her defense never really argued
that she was.

28:18.446 --> 28:22.117
To the contrary,
they introduced all kinds of evidence,

28:22.200 --> 28:24.703
religious, moral and otherwise

28:24.786 --> 28:27.872
to convince you that what she did
made total sense.

28:28.581 --> 28:31.584
Her daughter was murdered.
The killer was freed.

28:32.419 --> 28:33.253
Of course.

28:34.087 --> 28:36.464
Of course, she was outraged.

28:37.048 --> 28:38.675
And many of you would've been tempted

28:38.758 --> 28:41.886
to take the law into your own hands
just like she did.

28:42.262 --> 28:43.638
But you wouldn't have.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.515
As much as you'd want to give in

28:45.598 --> 28:48.643
to anarchy and lawlessness
and vigilantism,

28:49.060 --> 28:50.645
you wouldn't have.

28:51.396 --> 28:52.856
Because we have laws against it.

28:53.273 --> 28:55.400
We have consequences, like prison,

28:55.483 --> 28:58.945
to stop us from giving in
to our violent, primal,

28:59.028 --> 29:01.448
albeit sometimes natural, urges.

29:02.323 --> 29:06.828
Patrice Kelly is sitting here
because she said, "Screw the law."

29:07.245 --> 29:10.331
And now she's hoping that the 12 of you
will do exactly the same thing.

29:10.874 --> 29:14.377
Screw the law, you took an oath to uphold.

29:16.004 --> 29:20.091
The role of the juror in this country
is most noble.

29:20.341 --> 29:23.803
It's perhaps the highest form
of public service.

29:23.887 --> 29:26.806
Not because it's easy,
but because it's oftentimes difficult.

29:27.182 --> 29:28.725
Here you're being asked to convict

29:29.142 --> 29:31.436
a good woman,
a woman you no doubt relate to,

29:31.519 --> 29:34.898
a woman who your hearts quite
appropriately go out to.

29:35.482 --> 29:36.441
It's difficult.

29:39.277 --> 29:40.695
As the truth often is.

29:41.821 --> 29:45.325
The truth here is
that this was an act of revenge.

29:45.408 --> 29:51.831
Patrice Kelly deliberately, methodically
and reflectively killed Sean Harmon.

30:11.392 --> 30:12.435
This case has been...

30:15.563 --> 30:17.315
very unsettling.

30:17.398 --> 30:20.777
I'm so against the death penalty.

30:22.529 --> 30:26.157
A state-sanctioned, dispassionate,

30:26.950 --> 30:29.410
ceremonial taking of a human life.

30:31.371 --> 30:35.416
I have been an eyewitness
to five executions.

30:35.500 --> 30:38.837
They were vile, debased, and felt...

30:39.963 --> 30:41.840
horrifyingly sadistic.

30:42.465 --> 30:48.721
And yet, the thought of Sean Harmon
being killed feels...

30:51.724 --> 30:52.767
so good...

30:54.644 --> 30:55.645
and just.

30:56.479 --> 31:01.651
It turns out, you see, while the death
penalty might not be moral,

31:02.110 --> 31:03.945
revenge is.

31:04.487 --> 31:08.533
Studies are now surfacing
which show that vengeance,

31:08.616 --> 31:12.161
specifically the self-help kind, is good.

31:12.579 --> 31:15.373
Healthy even, like oat bran.

31:15.915 --> 31:18.877
New findings based on brain scans

31:18.960 --> 31:22.797
show that we get a burst of activity
in our prefrontal cortex

31:22.881 --> 31:26.926
from the very act of punishing those
who break social norms.

31:27.010 --> 31:28.678
And here's the best part.

31:28.761 --> 31:32.974
Relying instead on the state to avenge
our harms doesn't cut it.

31:33.057 --> 31:36.561
That, in fact,
weakens our moral instincts.

31:36.644 --> 31:41.149
According to recent findings
at Arizona State University,

31:41.232 --> 31:46.446
morality requires people to respond
to the quality of another person's acts.

31:46.529 --> 31:51.200
Letting the state or somebody else do
your bidding is, in fact, moral cowardice.

31:51.618 --> 31:55.079
This explains why one can be opposed
to the death penalty

31:55.413 --> 32:00.084
and nevertheless delighted
that Patrice Kelly shot Sean Harmon dead.

32:00.543 --> 32:03.838
Vengeance is sometimes right,
as it was here.

32:04.213 --> 32:06.966
The reason we all want Patrice to go free,

32:07.050 --> 32:11.054
the reason we get that little shot
of activity in our dorsal striatums

32:11.137 --> 32:15.141
when we think of Patrice Kelly
in her temporarily insane state

32:15.224 --> 32:17.268
putting a bullet in Sean Harmon's head

32:17.352 --> 32:19.437
is because it was the moral thing to do.

32:19.520 --> 32:23.650
This man bludgeoned her daughter to death
with a vodka bottle.

32:24.400 --> 32:27.195
If it had been your child who was killed,

32:27.278 --> 32:31.032
had your child's murderer walked away free

32:31.115 --> 32:33.451
with no consequences, no remorse,

32:33.534 --> 32:38.247
you would have wanted
to do exactly as she did.

32:41.167 --> 32:45.838
Mr. Betts admonished you to consider
the truth of what happened in this case.

32:45.922 --> 32:50.301
But in reality, he only wants you
to consider the bare, police report facts.

32:50.385 --> 32:52.178
And, as William Faulkner once said,

32:52.261 --> 32:55.139
facts and truth really don't have much
to do with each other.

32:55.223 --> 33:01.270
The truth in this case is that in a moment
of divine irrationality,

33:01.354 --> 33:04.148
a great wrong was set right.

33:04.816 --> 33:06.025
And justice...

33:08.945 --> 33:10.113
Justice...

33:11.155 --> 33:12.323
was finally done.

33:37.849 --> 33:41.477
Jury wants to know if they have the option
of manslaughter.

33:41.978 --> 33:43.855
As it stands now, they don't,

33:44.981 --> 33:47.233
not unless we amend the charges.

33:48.276 --> 33:51.446
So, do we add manslaughter?

33:52.071 --> 33:53.531
Their question says to me

33:53.614 --> 33:57.076
that they don't want to find her guilty
of first or second degree.

33:57.577 --> 33:59.537
But nor do they want to let her go.

34:00.538 --> 34:02.623
So, who's gonna blink?

34:09.005 --> 34:10.673
I'll agree to add manslaughter.

34:11.591 --> 34:12.550
Good.

34:13.426 --> 34:14.761
Mr. Shore?

34:18.806 --> 34:20.224
(sighs) No.

34:21.309 --> 34:23.144
Don't you think you should
check with your client?

34:23.227 --> 34:26.230
I will. But she's gonna ask me what
I think, and I'll tell her not to agree.

34:26.564 --> 34:28.232
My concern is,

34:29.025 --> 34:32.612
if you think revenge murder
is a moral good...

34:33.696 --> 34:36.449
maybe you're not seeing straight yourself.

34:50.588 --> 34:53.549
-What's up?
-Oh, just pretending to be busy.

34:53.633 --> 34:56.427
Waiting for Alan to get back
so I can smoke and drink

34:56.928 --> 34:58.304
and discuss my penis.

35:01.516 --> 35:02.517
You know, Denny...

35:03.810 --> 35:05.103
for all our differences...

35:06.562 --> 35:07.980
we go way back.

35:08.064 --> 35:09.982
Really? I don't remember.

35:10.900 --> 35:11.734
Mad cow.

35:12.693 --> 35:14.946
You joke about the mad cow,

35:15.446 --> 35:18.908
but clearly, if you're... slipping,

35:19.450 --> 35:22.370
do you really want to be on display
in a very public trial?

35:22.453 --> 35:25.164
I mean, why put yourself through
all of this?

35:25.248 --> 35:26.415
Just because you're angry?

35:27.500 --> 35:30.419
You seem to forget, Carl,

35:30.920 --> 35:34.173
that I had a perfectly good reason
to discharge Nancy Wilding.

35:34.715 --> 35:38.678
She's fat! Obesity is a disease.
I've got the gene.

35:38.761 --> 35:40.680
I had to fire her.
I couldn't risk catching it.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.932
-Catching it?
-Obesity.

35:43.015 --> 35:44.725
It's all right here in black and white.

35:45.268 --> 35:49.063
Obesity. It can spread from person
to person like a virus.

35:49.856 --> 35:51.065
I marked the page.

35:53.276 --> 35:56.070
-Is this for real?
-Fat people gotta go, Carl.

35:57.113 --> 35:58.072
They're contagious.

36:06.914 --> 36:10.251
-Leigh, you're back.
-Yes, I am.

36:10.918 --> 36:13.588
Listen. I've been thinking a lot
about what you said.

36:14.338 --> 36:17.341
Taking a chance
on trusting real people again,

36:17.800 --> 36:19.719
and it really resonated with me, Jerry.

36:20.511 --> 36:23.181
I would like somebody who I could talk to,

36:23.264 --> 36:26.267
somebody who's capable of talking back.

36:27.018 --> 36:32.273
I started wondering whether I knew anyone
who I could trust, and I don't.

36:32.565 --> 36:33.566
And then I thought...

36:36.235 --> 36:37.361
what about you?

36:37.904 --> 36:40.239
-(sputtering)
-(popping)

36:43.284 --> 36:45.036
I don't know your situation, Jerry,

36:45.411 --> 36:47.413
but would you like to get a drink with me?

36:48.080 --> 36:50.166
-Now?
-Never mind. I'm very sorry.

36:50.249 --> 36:52.877
-Forget I said that.
-(stuttering) I would love to get a drink.

36:52.960 --> 36:54.503
-You don't have to say that.
-No, I would.

36:54.587 --> 36:56.214
-No, no, no, no.
-I would!

37:00.176 --> 37:01.761
-Oh.
-(elevator bell dings)

37:01.844 --> 37:04.347
-Okay.
-Okay. (chuckles)

37:04.430 --> 37:06.015
-Shall we?
-Okay.

37:17.109 --> 37:19.111
We can still change our mind.

37:19.195 --> 37:21.614
We could just agree
to a plea of manslaughter.

37:21.697 --> 37:24.158
The district attorney
would probably accept it.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.995
I don't want to spend five years
in prison.

37:29.747 --> 37:31.666
But then the idea of doing life...

37:32.959 --> 37:35.044
I can't believe a jury
would want you to do life.

37:35.127 --> 37:39.131
Even if some did, certainly not all.
I just can't see all 12--

37:39.215 --> 37:42.218
(reporters clamoring)

37:42.635 --> 37:43.469
Jury's back.

37:44.845 --> 37:45.846
(door closes)

37:48.599 --> 37:51.602
Has the jury reached a unanimous verdict?

37:51.686 --> 37:53.604
We have, Your Honor.

37:54.021 --> 37:56.190
Will the defendant please rise?

37:58.734 --> 38:01.153
Mr. Foreman, what say you?

38:01.654 --> 38:05.366
"On count one,
the charge of murder in the first degree,

38:06.242 --> 38:08.786
"we find the defendant, Patrice Kelly...

38:09.870 --> 38:10.705
not guilty."

38:10.788 --> 38:11.956
(clamoring)

38:12.039 --> 38:16.961
"On count two, on the charge of murder
in the second degree,

38:17.044 --> 38:20.715
"we find the defendant, Patrice Kelly...

38:24.260 --> 38:25.344
not guilty."

38:25.428 --> 38:27.680
(crowd murmuring)

38:29.265 --> 38:30.266
Oh, my God.

38:30.349 --> 38:31.392
JUDGE FUDD:
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

38:31.475 --> 38:32.310
Oh, boy.

38:32.810 --> 38:34.437
JUDGE FUDD: ...we, uh,
thank you or your service.

38:35.813 --> 38:38.149
The defendant is free to go.

38:38.774 --> 38:41.527
-Thank you so much.
-JUDGE FUDD: And we are adjourned.

38:41.610 --> 38:43.029
(gavel raps)

38:48.534 --> 38:50.786
-WOMAN: Patrice, how do you feel?
-(reporters clamoring)

38:50.870 --> 38:53.039
-WOMAN 2: Are you relieved?
-MAN: Can you give us a statement?

39:03.132 --> 39:05.217
Can't deny this one scared me, Denny.

39:05.718 --> 39:07.345
As illegal as her actions were,

39:07.428 --> 39:09.972
I would've been devastated
had she gone to jail.

39:10.056 --> 39:11.766
And yet as justified as you say she was,

39:11.849 --> 39:14.143
you're telling me you're still against
the death penalty?

39:14.226 --> 39:15.936
-Absolutely.
-Doesn't make any sense.

39:16.020 --> 39:17.355
Makes perfect sense.

39:17.438 --> 39:20.441
It's okay for her to execute him,
but if the government does it for her...

39:20.524 --> 39:21.650
That would be wrong.

39:22.735 --> 39:25.071
Leave it to you liberals to come up
with the research

39:25.154 --> 39:28.783
that says it's okay to be for revenge
and against the death penalty.

39:28.866 --> 39:33.120
It's a lot like being for the
death penalty and yet pro-life.

39:33.204 --> 39:35.498
-You wanna go there? I can go there.
-You started it.

39:35.581 --> 39:37.708
I didn't start it.
I'm just saying that you...

39:38.376 --> 39:40.002
are a hypocrite.

39:40.086 --> 39:41.545
-(laughs) No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

39:41.629 --> 39:43.047
You come up with these studies.

39:43.130 --> 39:46.884
And another thing about you Democrats,
you all believe in science.

39:46.967 --> 39:49.887
You should remember that little gem
for your testimony.

39:50.888 --> 39:53.432
I will, don't you worry.

39:54.183 --> 39:55.267
(sighs)

39:57.728 --> 39:58.687
Will you defend me?

39:59.605 --> 40:01.565
Since I'm a witness,
I'll need a lawyer to defend me.

40:01.649 --> 40:02.650
Will you defend me?

40:04.735 --> 40:07.071
-I'll defend you, Denny.
-Thank you.

40:07.154 --> 40:08.906
I'd like to know why you did it.

40:09.490 --> 40:11.992
Was it because she turned you down
for sex?

40:13.828 --> 40:16.330
Alan, when a man gets older,

40:16.956 --> 40:18.916
begins to suffer various...

40:20.084 --> 40:21.127
indignities.

40:21.585 --> 40:24.547
But to be turned down by a fat girl...

40:24.630 --> 40:25.548
Another little gem.

40:25.631 --> 40:28.050
Well, you're out there trying
these murder cases,

40:28.134 --> 40:32.555
and I'm in my office twiddling my thumbs,
being rejected by fatties.

40:35.933 --> 40:37.351
I am not over.

40:40.229 --> 40:42.606
I'm sick of people thinking I'm over.

40:45.276 --> 40:46.485
I know you're not over.

40:47.111 --> 40:50.489
As far as I'm concerned, Denny,
you've never been more now.

40:52.366 --> 40:53.200
Thank you.

40:56.495 --> 40:58.247
-I read another study.
-Here we go.

40:58.330 --> 41:01.792
Talked about how men sometimes seek
younger female partners

41:01.876 --> 41:03.794
as a way of staying younger themselves.

41:03.878 --> 41:06.213
-That surprises you?
-No, but it went on to say

41:06.297 --> 41:11.051
that sometimes they seek out
younger male friends for the same reason.

41:11.927 --> 41:13.637
-You're insecure.
-No.

41:13.721 --> 41:14.722
Yes, you are.

41:15.764 --> 41:20.603
Well, sometimes I wonder if we'd be
as close if I wasn't some young thing.

41:21.437 --> 41:22.271
Alan.

41:23.022 --> 41:25.399
First of all, you're no spring chicken,
and second...

41:27.485 --> 41:28.486
Forget it.

41:29.195 --> 41:30.946
-What?
-No, I said forget it.

41:31.030 --> 41:32.198
-You were about to say something.
-No, I wasn't.

41:32.281 --> 41:33.991
-Denny.
-I wasn't, damn it.

41:35.701 --> 41:38.621
Well, then finish the sentence.
"Second..."

41:39.413 --> 41:40.414
Second, what?

41:44.084 --> 41:45.085
Second...

41:51.383 --> 41:52.635
I love you.

41:57.056 --> 41:59.016
And it has nothing to do with your youth.

42:05.105 --> 42:07.942
-Sleepover?
-That's why I said forget it.

42:08.025 --> 42:09.652
What's... What's wrong? What's the problem

42:09.735 --> 42:10.736
-with my suggesting?
-Because it's artificial.

42:11.904 --> 42:14.490
I feel I have to say something soft,
like I'm always asking for it.

42:14.573 --> 42:16.867
-Well, now you're being ridiculous.
-I am not being ridiculous.

42:16.951 --> 42:19.995
-It seems every time...
-Every time you ask me for a sleepover--

42:20.079 --> 42:21.789
-...you get angry...
-Because...

42:21.872 --> 42:23.874
(both talking indistinctly)

42:23.958 --> 42:26.961
-And it's not your place...
-Denny, I know what it is, too.

42:27.044 --> 42:29.505
You're embarrassed
of your horrendous snoring.

42:29.588 --> 42:30.422
DENNY:<i> That's all I'm saying.</i>

42:30.506 --> 42:33.801
ALAN:<i> Ever since I had the dream</i>
<i>that there's the bear in the room...</i>

42:34.510 --> 42:35.678
NARRATOR:<i> Next on </i>Boston Legal...

42:35.761 --> 42:37.304
I'm being charged with murder.

42:37.388 --> 42:39.306
I thought he had a gun,
turned out to be a soda can.

42:39.390 --> 42:43.477
District attorney's saying the shooting's
racially motivated, but I'm not a racist.

42:43.561 --> 42:46.146
I'm sick of dishonest, disingenuous men.

42:46.230 --> 42:49.024
I tried to let you down nicely,
and you punish me for it.

42:49.108 --> 42:51.652
I should have opted for cruelty?
What do you want from me?

42:51.735 --> 42:54.697
It's the fat bigot and his friend,
Mr. Puffy Tongue.

42:54.780 --> 42:57.366
How does her weight jeopardize
your health?

42:57.449 --> 43:00.077
Obesity can spread
like a contagious disease.

43:00.160 --> 43:01.579
That's not my opinion, that's Harvard's.

43:01.662 --> 43:04.540
-Did you hear that?
-I only heard, "Ka-ching, ka-ching."

43:06.166 --> 43:09.169
