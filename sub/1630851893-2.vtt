WEBVTT

00:11.845 --> 00:12.846
Vinnie.

00:13.722 --> 00:15.015
Yeah?

00:15.933 --> 00:17.267
Is Dad dead?

00:17.893 --> 00:18.894
No.

00:19.645 --> 00:20.646
Oh, God.

00:20.729 --> 00:23.649
It was just a small heart attack.
He's fine.

00:24.608 --> 00:26.068
Tell me again.

00:26.818 --> 00:27.945
Tell you what?

00:28.028 --> 00:30.280
Tell me again he's not dead.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.573
He isn't dead.

00:32.658 --> 00:36.370
He fainted and hit his head
and lost consciousness.

00:36.453 --> 00:39.081
But we put some smelling salts
under his nose

00:39.164 --> 00:42.042
and poured some whiskey
down his throat and he came to.

00:42.125 --> 00:46.755
He'll probably be in bed
for a couple days, but he's fine.

00:46.839 --> 00:49.424
He's breathing. He knows his own name.

00:50.259 --> 00:52.427
Nobody even had to call a doctor.

00:54.096 --> 00:57.015
Oh, God, what a horrible dinner. Geez.

00:57.099 --> 00:58.684
You don't like my hasty pudding?

00:58.767 --> 01:01.478
Obviously, I'm not talking about the food,
Vinnie.

01:02.145 --> 01:05.691
I'm talking about all the awful things
that Austin said last night.

01:07.109 --> 01:09.319
About our family, about Dad.

01:10.153 --> 01:12.573
-What if they're true?
-What?

01:12.656 --> 01:14.700
Look, I don't know. Okay?

01:15.450 --> 01:19.371
I don't know what has gone wrong
in my life, but something has.

01:19.454 --> 01:21.582
I'm not where I wanted to be.

01:22.165 --> 01:23.709
I'm nowhere.

01:23.792 --> 01:26.920
It's like all of my choices
have been wrong. All of them.

01:27.004 --> 01:31.008
I-- I have no happiness, Emily.
All I have is regret.

01:32.259 --> 01:35.721
I'm so lonely, I'm doomed.

01:35.804 --> 01:37.181
And I guess I'm just asking

01:37.264 --> 01:42.394
if maybe some of that is Dad's fault.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.274
Is this about Joseph Lyman?

01:48.025 --> 01:49.985
It's about every one
of my dead ex-boyfriends…

01:52.154 --> 01:56.241
who I should've married
when I had the chance.

01:57.159 --> 02:02.289
And instead, I held out, as if there were
some great future I was waiting for.

02:02.372 --> 02:05.209
Well, here we are in the future,
and it's awful.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.628
And everyone I ever loved is gone.

02:07.711 --> 02:09.003
That's not true.

02:11.256 --> 02:12.299
I'm still here.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.053
And so is the rest of our family.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.430
-And so is Dad, thank God.
-Yeah.

02:18.514 --> 02:20.849
His life could have ended last night,
but it didn't.

02:22.351 --> 02:24.436
We're all still here, Vin.

02:25.229 --> 02:26.855
We still have each other.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.359
I am not gonna let this family fall apart.

02:30.442 --> 02:35.447
There is too much pain
in the world already.

02:37.241 --> 02:38.367
You're right.

02:39.034 --> 02:41.161
I have so much grieving to do.

02:41.245 --> 02:43.330
I can't deal with a civil war
in our own house.

02:43.413 --> 02:46.291
Whatever happened last night,
we need to put behind us. Okay?

02:47.292 --> 02:50.712
Austin needs to apologize to Dad
and unite this family.

02:51.755 --> 02:52.965
I'm not giving up hope.

02:53.549 --> 02:54.925
Do you really think he will?

02:55.843 --> 02:57.344
He said he was "seceding."

02:57.427 --> 03:01.014
Right. Well, I am questioning
his constitutional right to do that.

03:02.766 --> 03:04.893
Thank you for letting me
sleep here last night.

03:06.478 --> 03:08.438
Wanna know the best part
about not getting married?

03:09.147 --> 03:13.360
-What?
-It's getting to spend so much time…

03:14.570 --> 03:15.779
with me!

03:21.493 --> 03:23.412
Dickinson

03:23.495 --> 03:25.497
It feels a shame to be Alive -

03:46.518 --> 03:47.603
Austin?

04:00.199 --> 04:01.200
Morning, Sue.

04:02.159 --> 04:03.160
Hey, you.

04:04.328 --> 04:05.662
Quite the spread you got here.

04:06.997 --> 04:08.081
Where's Austin?

04:08.165 --> 04:09.374
I haven't seen him.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.251
You mean all of this food is for you?

04:11.960 --> 04:14.671
I'm really gonna miss eating for two
when this is all over.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.839
By the looks of this,
you could be having triplets.

04:16.923 --> 04:20.177
You know, I did feel some pretty extreme
kicking in there last night.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.554
Would make sense
if there were multiple sets of feet.

04:22.638 --> 04:24.431
I thought you might have been
having contractions.

04:24.515 --> 04:26.183
Me too.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.935
Turns out it was just really bad gas.

04:28.018 --> 04:29.269
-Gross.
-Oh, Emily.

04:29.353 --> 04:32.064
It's just nature at work. You love nature.

04:32.147 --> 04:34.691
-I don't feel like talking about farts.
-Want a muffin?

04:34.775 --> 04:37.110
No. I-- No.

04:37.903 --> 04:39.613
I'm still too shaken to eat.

04:41.573 --> 04:43.825
God, last night was so scary, Sue.

04:44.535 --> 04:46.662
I honestly thought my dad was dead.

04:46.745 --> 04:48.330
Like, I thought Austin killed him.

04:48.914 --> 04:49.957
Yeah, well…

04:51.166 --> 04:54.711
luckily, words can't kill people.

04:55.879 --> 04:57.631
Not even your words.

04:57.714 --> 05:00.008
And you're a much better poet than Austin.

05:01.093 --> 05:02.970
Yeah, well, Austin needs to apologize.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.931
That's why I'm here. I need to get
everyone back together again.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.559
I thought you were here to see me.

05:10.102 --> 05:11.103
Sue.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.730
Sue, don't you understand?

05:14.857 --> 05:18.318
My family is in complete chaos right now.

05:19.486 --> 05:22.906
I mean, can you believe the things
that Austin said last night? My God.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.158
Yes.

05:26.869 --> 05:29.705
As a matter of fact, I agree with him.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.333
You what?

05:33.417 --> 05:36.253
Your family has serious problems.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.463
Problems that, unfortunately,
can't be solved.

05:38.547 --> 05:40.132
What are you talking about?

05:41.842 --> 05:45.095
I mean,
just look at the way they've treated you.

05:45.179 --> 05:47.848
Your mother and father,
they've been awful to you.

05:49.975 --> 05:52.186
They have no idea how special you are.

05:52.269 --> 05:55.564
I mean, th-- And instead,
they treat you like you're the crazy one.

05:57.900 --> 06:01.695
Look, maybe I'm just noticing this more

06:01.778 --> 06:04.114
because I'm about to become a mother,

06:04.198 --> 06:08.285
and once this baby's born,
I want it to know

06:08.368 --> 06:12.664
that whoever it turns out to be,
that I love it, unconditionally.

06:13.498 --> 06:14.917
Same way I love you.

06:21.381 --> 06:24.760
I love you so much, Emily.

06:26.470 --> 06:29.681
If it were up to me, we'd--

06:30.933 --> 06:34.603
we'd run away from your family
and raise this baby together.

06:35.479 --> 06:36.813
Can you imagine that?

06:37.397 --> 06:38.941
We could just escape

06:39.691 --> 06:41.818
and never see
any of these people ever again.

06:44.488 --> 06:46.240
I think I'd miss them.

06:47.658 --> 06:48.659
Would you?

06:53.038 --> 06:55.415
Where is Austin?
I really need to talk to him.

06:55.499 --> 06:57.793
I haven't seen him.
He didn't come home last night.

06:57.876 --> 07:01.255
-Are you sure you don't want some sausage?
-No. I mean, yes. I'm sure.

07:01.338 --> 07:02.339
It's really deliciou--

07:03.549 --> 07:04.967
-What?
-Oh, my God!

07:05.050 --> 07:07.052
-What is happening?
-Oh, my God. It's coming.

07:07.135 --> 07:08.428
-It's not gas?
-No.

07:08.512 --> 07:10.597
-What do I do?
-Will you get some help, please?

07:10.681 --> 07:12.307
-Yes! I'm going! Are you okay--
-Please!

07:12.391 --> 07:13.475
-Okay.
-Go get help!

07:13.559 --> 07:15.227
-Mom!
-I'm not okay.

07:17.187 --> 07:20.190
Well, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to scare you, Mrs. Dickinson.

07:20.274 --> 07:22.276
It's all right, Edward.
I knew you weren't dead.

07:22.359 --> 07:23.694
You did? How?

07:23.777 --> 07:25.863
Because a wife knows these things.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.073
Besides,
you would never leave us so suddenly.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.992
You would be sure to drag it out.

07:30.576 --> 07:31.743
Need a refill, Dad?

07:31.827 --> 07:33.871
Vinnie brought the tea. So good of you.

07:33.954 --> 07:38.250
Yeah, well, what else is a lonely spinster
supposed to do but nurse her own father?

07:38.333 --> 07:39.376
Put it over there.

07:40.502 --> 07:43.005
Help! Help!
Everybody, Sue's having the baby!

07:43.088 --> 07:44.840
The baby? Are you sure?

07:44.923 --> 07:48.135
Yes. She's going into labor.
What do we do? Should I get a doctor?

07:48.218 --> 07:50.429
I could ride into town like Paul Revere.

07:50.512 --> 07:52.890
Absolutely not.
There is no need for doctors.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.976
-There isn't?
-I will be delivering this child.

07:56.059 --> 07:57.436
Wait. What?

07:57.519 --> 08:00.189
Yes, that's right. I will be the midwife.

08:00.272 --> 08:03.609
Why, on the Norcross farm,
we never needed doctors.

08:03.692 --> 08:07.487
When a baby came, we rolled up our sleeves
and handled it ourselves.

08:07.571 --> 08:09.823
-Not to mention all the calves and foals.
-Okay.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.743
It's all coming back to me now.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.704
The smell of the barn at sunrise,

08:15.787 --> 08:20.334
Aunt Lavinia and I mucking out the stalls
after delivering a fresh baby goat.

08:20.417 --> 08:24.755
-Well, Sue's baby goat is on its way, so--
-No, wait a minute!

08:24.838 --> 08:27.341
-Who's going to look after me?
-You're fine, Edward.

08:27.424 --> 08:31.386
-It was nothing more than a dizzy spell.
-I'm fairly certain it was a heart attack.

08:31.470 --> 08:34.264
You just need some rest.
Besides, Vinnie will stay with you.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.140
-Right, Lavinia?
-Yes.

08:36.225 --> 08:38.852
It might be slightly awkward,
since I'm in the process

08:38.936 --> 08:42.188
-of reevaluating our entire relationship.
-Perfect.

08:42.272 --> 08:43.941
Now, Emily, grab the sheets.

08:44.024 --> 08:47.819
-Sheets.
-And, Maggie, fetch the buckets!

08:51.949 --> 08:53.951
Is there something we could do to help?

08:54.535 --> 08:55.869
You think this is painful?

08:55.953 --> 08:57.454
We're just getting started.

08:57.538 --> 09:00.374
Maybe chloroform would soothe her.
I hear it's all the rage.

09:00.457 --> 09:02.793
-Queen Victoria swears by it.
-Yeah. Sounds great.

09:02.876 --> 09:07.089
Nonsense. We never had anything like that
on the Norcross farm.

09:07.172 --> 09:10.050
Sue will be having this baby au naturel.
Won't you, Sue?

09:10.133 --> 09:11.593
I'm in quite a lot of pain.

09:11.677 --> 09:12.761
Good.

09:12.845 --> 09:15.013
-Pain is how you know you're still alive.
-Mom!

09:15.097 --> 09:18.433
Don't say that.
You know Sue's mother died in childbirth.

09:18.517 --> 09:20.018
Did she?

09:20.102 --> 09:23.272
-There is no finer way for a woman to go.
-Mom.

09:23.355 --> 09:24.898
-The ultimate sacrifice.
-Oh, God.

09:24.982 --> 09:26.942
She's gonna be okay. Right, Maggie?

09:27.025 --> 09:29.111
I don't know. Slim hips.

09:29.736 --> 09:32.573
-Most important is that the baby survives.
-Oh, God.

09:32.656 --> 09:34.116
Why don't we shoot
for everybody surviving?

09:34.199 --> 09:37.536
Emily? Emily, I don't think I can do this.

09:37.619 --> 09:43.041
I mean, how can a human being
come out of such a tiny hole?

09:43.125 --> 09:45.961
It doesn't make any sense.
How does anyone pull this off?

09:46.044 --> 09:47.588
That's enough!

09:48.213 --> 09:49.965
This isn't about you anymore, Susan.

09:50.048 --> 09:53.010
There's a precious life inside of you
that needs you to be strong.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.304
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

09:55.387 --> 09:58.223
Good. Now,
someone bring me the sheep shears.

09:58.307 --> 10:00.350
-Sheep shears?
-What do you need these for?

10:00.434 --> 10:03.103
Oh, I'll be using
quite a lot of farm equipment.

10:05.731 --> 10:07.232
Contractions are coming faster.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.359
Okay, well, listen.

10:09.443 --> 10:11.945
If the baby's coming,
Austin should be here. I better--

10:12.029 --> 10:14.698
Emily Dickinson,
don't you dare leave this room.

10:14.781 --> 10:17.034
But he is the father. He should be here.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.077
I don't need Austin. I need you.

10:19.161 --> 10:22.623
Okay, okay. God. How is your delicate
little hand so strong?

10:22.706 --> 10:25.709
Because I am in pain.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.253
Take a nip of this, dearie.

10:28.337 --> 10:29.880
-That'll take the edge off.
-Okay.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.049
I snuck it over just in case.

10:32.758 --> 10:35.594
Forget the sheep shears.
I'm gonna need the pig scraper.

11:07.793 --> 11:10.712
-This is why you live in New England.
-Oh, my God. Totally.

11:10.796 --> 11:13.507
Maple sugaring is my favorite
seasonal activity.

11:13.590 --> 11:14.633
It's my favorite too.

11:14.716 --> 11:16.844
You said pumpkin carving
was your favorite.

11:16.927 --> 11:19.721
-Can I have two favorites?
-Abby. No.

11:19.805 --> 11:23.809
Hey! It's not my fault.
New England brings me so much joy.

11:23.892 --> 11:25.644
My tree produced, like, nothing.

11:25.727 --> 11:28.564
A maple tree has to be 45
before it can produce good sap.

11:28.647 --> 11:30.649
Look at George with his facts.

11:30.732 --> 11:32.901
Hey, where the hell is Frazar?

11:32.985 --> 11:35.112
This is supposed to be a farewell party
for him.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.780
I can't believe he's enlisting.

11:36.864 --> 11:39.116
Pressure to sign up is getting real, man.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.994
Won't be long before all of us have to go.

11:42.077 --> 11:44.037
What about you, buddy? Gonna go fight?

11:44.121 --> 11:46.331
I'm not sure the army would want me.

11:46.415 --> 11:47.875
I'm kind of a mess these days.

11:47.958 --> 11:49.293
Plus, you're having a baby.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.795
Plenty of young fathers in this war,
sad to say.

11:52.421 --> 11:56.258
Yes. At the end of the day,
a man must do his duty.

11:56.341 --> 11:57.801
Why can't women be soldiers?

11:57.885 --> 12:00.470
-How about some equality?
-Abby.

12:00.554 --> 12:03.640
Anyone know where I can get a snowball
drizzled in fresh maple syrup?

12:05.225 --> 12:07.561
-Hey, man.
-Frazar, man!

12:07.644 --> 12:09.771
-Looking good. Looking really good.
-Yeah.

12:09.855 --> 12:11.690
My mom just finished
sewing the collar on this coat.

12:11.773 --> 12:14.484
-Snappy.
-You look like a real hero, Stearns.

12:14.568 --> 12:17.154
-That's Adjutant Stearns to you.
-That's right.

12:17.237 --> 12:20.324
-Amherst's golden boy, everybody.
-We're so proud of you, Frazar.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.076
Thanks so much
for getting the gang together, Austin.

12:23.160 --> 12:25.162
Means a lot to see you all one last time.

12:26.121 --> 12:27.956
One last time? Come on.

12:28.040 --> 12:31.793
-We'll be seeing you when the war's over.
-Yeah. Yeah. Maybe.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.047
Come on.
They're not gonna get Amherst's finest.

12:35.130 --> 12:37.591
Yeah, you're the star
of the field hockey team,

12:37.674 --> 12:41.303
-son of the college president--
-And war is exactly like field hockey.

12:43.722 --> 12:45.849
Well, in any case here,
there's no escaping it now.

12:45.933 --> 12:48.352
Come on.
You've always been the best of us.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.604
-You're a true hero.
-Hey, where is Emily?

12:50.687 --> 12:53.357
-Who?
-Emily Dickinson.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.816
Your sister?

12:54.900 --> 12:57.319
I was hoping to say goodbye.
Is she gonna swing by?

12:58.946 --> 12:59.947
I don't know.

13:00.739 --> 13:02.449
I'm not really speaking to my family.

13:02.533 --> 13:05.327
-Austin, what happened?
-We'll talk about it later.

13:05.410 --> 13:08.497
All right, let's make this
a proper send-off, huh?

13:08.580 --> 13:11.083
Three cheers for Frazar Stearns. Hip, hip…

13:11.166 --> 13:12.626
-Hooray!
-Hip, hip…

13:12.709 --> 13:14.628
-Hooray!
-Hip, hip…

13:14.711 --> 13:17.548
Are we that wait - sufficient worth -

13:18.674 --> 13:20.384
That such Enormous Pearl

13:21.218 --> 13:24.221
As life - dissolved be - for Us -

13:25.681 --> 13:27.516
In Battle's - horrid Bowl?

13:32.896 --> 13:36.525
Sorry. I am so nauseous.
I don't like this at all.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.374
Can you just push a lit--

13:52.457 --> 13:53.458
Yeah.

13:55.252 --> 13:59.756
Man, I definitely did not realize
giving birth was so slow.

13:59.840 --> 14:02.342
The child comes when the child's ready.

14:02.426 --> 14:03.927
It's the same with donkeys.

14:04.595 --> 14:06.388
You know what I love about birthing?

14:06.471 --> 14:09.474
The surprise.
You never know what you're gonna get.

14:10.058 --> 14:13.187
One time,
a cousin of mine had conjoined twins.

14:13.270 --> 14:16.607
Three arms, two heads. Maybe
Sue's got a pair of them tucked in there.

14:18.275 --> 14:21.778
-How much longer is this gonna take?
-It's a mystery, dear. No one knows.

14:21.862 --> 14:25.199
But I could probably hazard a guess.
Let's take a look, shall we?

14:25.282 --> 14:26.867
Oh, God. No. I don't-- No.

14:29.077 --> 14:30.495
Hold still, Susan.

14:30.579 --> 14:33.248
Still got about three hours.
She's only one inch dilated.

14:34.416 --> 14:36.168
Don't know if I can take three more hours.

14:36.251 --> 14:37.419
You can't? What about me?

14:37.503 --> 14:40.589
Listen, Emily,
it's like Aunt Lavinia and me used to say.

14:40.672 --> 14:42.758
If you can't handle horses,
get out of the barn.

14:42.841 --> 14:44.801
Maybe you should step outside.

14:44.885 --> 14:46.970
Take a breather, dearie.
You're gonna need it.

14:49.306 --> 14:51.850
-Is it okay if I step--
-Just go.

14:54.436 --> 14:56.647
She could be pushing harder
with her hind legs.

14:56.730 --> 15:00.359
-Interesting theory.
-I'm gonna need you on all fours, sweetie.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.783
Who's here? Maybe Austin.

15:09.910 --> 15:12.204
Frazar. It's you.

15:12.287 --> 15:15.290
Emily. I came to say goodbye.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.001
Goodbye.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.879
So, you're… leaving?

15:20.963 --> 15:23.757
Yes. Heading down to Virginia tomorrow.

15:23.841 --> 15:25.634
Then we're marching to North Carolina.

15:25.717 --> 15:27.052
Wow.

15:27.135 --> 15:30.222
-I'm so sorry Austin's not here.
-No, I already saw him.

15:31.181 --> 15:32.933
I came here to say goodbye to you.

15:34.226 --> 15:35.602
You're not busy, are you?

15:35.686 --> 15:39.356
No. Just sitting around,
waiting for Sue's baby to be born.

15:39.982 --> 15:41.525
I didn't realize. I don't want to intrude.

15:41.608 --> 15:46.029
No, no. It's okay. It's taking forever,
and I could use a drink.

15:46.113 --> 15:47.114
Why don't you come in?

15:54.621 --> 15:55.622
Should we go back?

15:58.292 --> 15:59.459
Here you are.

16:03.547 --> 16:04.548
Cheers.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.684
I'm glad you came to find me.

16:18.437 --> 16:21.565
I would have been really sad if we didn't
get the chance to say goodbye.

16:21.648 --> 16:24.276
Me too. I had to see you before I left.

16:24.985 --> 16:28.739
You know?
Seeing as I might never come back.

16:32.201 --> 16:33.577
All that?

16:34.912 --> 16:38.207
Look, you can't take
that whole me having a vision

16:38.290 --> 16:40.375
about how you're gonna die
thing seriously.

16:40.459 --> 16:43.003
I am a weirdo. You know that.

16:43.086 --> 16:45.297
I'm the crazy one. Right?

16:45.380 --> 16:48.634
-I'm sure you're gonna be fine, and--
-Please don't do that.

16:50.385 --> 16:51.678
Don't do what?

16:52.387 --> 16:55.599
Don't be all fake and happy
like the rest of 'em.

16:57.226 --> 17:00.812
You're the only one who's ever been real
with me about what this war might cost.

17:02.898 --> 17:05.442
You're the only one
who's brave enough to face the truth.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.654
You don't try and peddle some false hope.

17:11.448 --> 17:13.867
What if hope is all we have?

17:18.038 --> 17:19.665
Sometimes…

17:22.584 --> 17:24.502
the most hopeful thing you can do

17:24.586 --> 17:28.632
is to look directly at the darkness.

17:32.553 --> 17:34.805
-By the way, I don't think you're crazy.
-You don't?

17:34.888 --> 17:35.889
No!

17:37.474 --> 17:38.934
It's the world that's insane.

17:40.310 --> 17:42.145
The only thing that makes you different is

17:42.229 --> 17:44.273
you're not afraid to call it
like you see it.

17:46.608 --> 17:49.987
It's what makes a great writer. You know?

17:50.070 --> 17:53.740
Great writers don't flinch at the truth,
even if it's tragic.

17:54.449 --> 17:55.909
Look at Dante.

17:56.660 --> 17:57.870
The Inferno.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.582
He went all the way down into hell,

18:02.499 --> 18:04.376
came back to tell about it.

18:05.502 --> 18:06.503
Well…

18:11.717 --> 18:13.719
I really hope you come back.

18:17.931 --> 18:22.436
"Another decisive victory for General Lee
leaves 2,000 Union soldiers dead

18:22.519 --> 18:24.146
and 7,000 wounded."

18:24.229 --> 18:27.774
Great. 2,000 more guys
I could have married.

18:27.858 --> 18:29.651
2,000 more that got away.

18:29.735 --> 18:32.487
-What about the Confederates?
-What about them?

18:32.571 --> 18:34.281
How many casualties on that side?

18:34.364 --> 18:38.035
-Is there a list of names?
-I see what you're saying.

18:38.118 --> 18:42.039
I could have married them too. True,
there would've been political differences,

18:42.122 --> 18:45.959
but maybe that makes for
interesting conversations over breakfast.

18:46.043 --> 18:48.921
I'm just wondering
if my brother was involved.

18:49.671 --> 18:52.674
Your uncle Sam, down in Savannah,
he's fighting for the other side.

18:57.888 --> 19:01.517
They don't list any names from the South.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.977
I suppose we don't even think of them
as people anymore.

19:05.896 --> 19:08.190
That's what hatred gets you, Vinnie.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.817
Hatred and division.

19:12.319 --> 19:14.530
It's a shameful time to be alive.

19:16.490 --> 19:19.493
Might have been better
if my heart really had stopped last night.

19:21.119 --> 19:23.038
Well, I am glad that you're not dead.

19:23.121 --> 19:24.414
You are?

19:24.498 --> 19:25.707
Yeah.

19:26.500 --> 19:29.711
Thanks to this war,
I'm losing all of my potential soul mates.

19:30.671 --> 19:33.340
It would have been kind of rough
to lose my dad as well.

19:35.092 --> 19:37.469
Well, maybe you could just read
the sports section.

19:39.596 --> 19:40.597
Okay.

19:45.769 --> 19:49.106
You know, I was surprised
you didn't bring Billy today.

19:49.189 --> 19:51.191
He loves maple syrup snowballs.

19:51.984 --> 19:53.861
He didn't sleep very well last night.

19:55.112 --> 19:56.405
Neither did I.

19:56.488 --> 19:59.408
I never sleep well without you.

20:03.036 --> 20:04.496
You saved my life.

20:05.414 --> 20:07.416
You know that, right?

20:08.750 --> 20:10.127
Being with you,

20:10.919 --> 20:12.921
getting to get to take care of Billy,

20:14.047 --> 20:16.258
it's the only thing that brings me joy.

20:17.384 --> 20:18.385
It's everything.

20:20.137 --> 20:21.763
You're all that I've got.

20:22.890 --> 20:25.142
I'd do anything for you, Jane.

20:25.225 --> 20:26.643
Austin, stop.

20:28.437 --> 20:30.772
We can't do this anymore. I told you.

20:31.356 --> 20:32.357
Why not?

20:33.317 --> 20:35.319
Because Sue is having a baby.

20:36.278 --> 20:37.988
That doesn't have to change anything.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.990
Yeah. And because I'm…

20:41.450 --> 20:43.118
Because I'm gonna marry somebody else.

20:44.077 --> 20:45.078
You're…

20:46.914 --> 20:47.915
You're what?

20:48.498 --> 20:51.126
There's a business associate
of my father's.

20:51.210 --> 20:52.628
A man named Pierre.

20:53.921 --> 20:55.547
He's asked for my hand.

20:56.924 --> 20:59.468
Pierre-- Pierre who? Do I know him?

20:59.551 --> 21:01.762
No. He's not from around here.

21:02.387 --> 21:05.390
He's from France. Actually, Vietnam.

21:08.936 --> 21:10.395
He owns a rice plantation.

21:11.188 --> 21:12.439
And he's…

21:13.815 --> 21:15.192
he's developing ports

21:15.275 --> 21:18.278
so they can open up to French trade.

21:19.279 --> 21:20.280
Wow.

21:21.114 --> 21:22.783
He sounds super problematic.

21:23.325 --> 21:25.827
Well, all I know is that he has money,

21:25.911 --> 21:28.163
and he can provide
a good education for Billy.

21:28.247 --> 21:31.208
-I'm perfectly willing to pay for school.
-Austin…

21:33.126 --> 21:37.172
It's just-- It's not going to work. Okay?
This town is too small.

21:37.256 --> 21:38.799
You're asking me to live a life of shame,

21:38.882 --> 21:40.717
-and I'm not going to do that.
-No, no, no.

21:40.801 --> 21:42.094
Jane, Jane.

21:42.803 --> 21:43.804
Please.

21:44.638 --> 21:47.558
Don't go. Please.

21:48.725 --> 21:51.311
Our tickets to Vietnam
have already been purchased.

21:53.856 --> 21:55.482
I had no choice.

21:56.650 --> 21:59.152
I think someday you'll understand that.

22:02.698 --> 22:03.866
I hope…

22:04.867 --> 22:08.370
I hope your wife learns
to take better care of you.

22:25.179 --> 22:26.763
It's getting late.

22:27.389 --> 22:28.807
I still need to pack.

22:30.475 --> 22:31.977
I wish you didn't have to go.

22:33.312 --> 22:34.688
Destiny calls.

22:37.733 --> 22:40.235
I'm gonna miss this town.
Good old Amherst.

22:40.319 --> 22:43.197
Yeah.
I'm pretty attached to the place myself.

22:43.280 --> 22:47.284
Hey, there's something I'd like you
to give me to take to the war.

22:47.367 --> 22:48.368
Anything.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.121
A poem.

22:54.291 --> 22:55.959
I'll carry it in my pocket right here.

22:59.922 --> 23:01.673
Your words will bring me hope.

23:03.383 --> 23:04.635
Not false hope?

23:04.718 --> 23:05.719
No.

23:06.803 --> 23:08.013
Real hope.

23:10.140 --> 23:13.810
The kind that's brave enough to admit
that sometimes things don't get better.

23:20.484 --> 23:22.152
Here. You can have this one.

23:23.278 --> 23:24.696
I wrote it today.

23:28.158 --> 23:29.826
Who did you write it for?

23:31.203 --> 23:32.204
I wrote it…

23:33.914 --> 23:34.915
for Nobody.

23:44.424 --> 23:46.176
It feels a shame to be Alive -

23:47.010 --> 23:49.680
When Men so brave are dead -

23:50.681 --> 23:52.599
One envies the distinguished dust -

23:53.934 --> 23:56.562
Permitted - such a Head -

23:58.605 --> 23:59.815
Thank you, Emily.

24:14.413 --> 24:16.206
The baby's crowning. Emily, come quick.

24:21.837 --> 24:25.340
Glory, Glory, Hallelujah

24:26.508 --> 24:32.055
His truth is marching on

24:33.473 --> 24:34.474
Oh, my God.

24:34.558 --> 24:35.726
You're back.

24:37.144 --> 24:38.145
'Sup, Sis?

24:40.689 --> 24:42.149
Austin, you missed it.

24:42.232 --> 24:44.568
I think you'll find I hit it perfectly.

24:44.651 --> 24:47.279
No, no, no, no. The baby.

24:47.905 --> 24:50.490
Your baby was just born.
Austin, you're a father.

24:57.456 --> 24:58.874
How come no one came and got me?

24:59.458 --> 25:02.085
Well, I wanted to. I really did. I-- I--

25:03.003 --> 25:05.088
I even said that I was g-- It all--

25:05.172 --> 25:07.424
It all just-- It all happened so fast.

25:09.593 --> 25:12.179
Wait. Really quickly,
I wanted to talk about last night.

25:12.262 --> 25:14.139
I don't want to talk about last night.

25:14.806 --> 25:16.225
I wanna go meet my child.

25:16.308 --> 25:17.643
Right. No. I know that.

25:17.726 --> 25:20.312
But some things you said,
you need to take them back.

25:22.481 --> 25:24.942
Do you not think it's important,
now that there's a baby,

25:25.025 --> 25:26.693
for this family to stick together?

25:26.777 --> 25:28.445
I think it's a little too late for that.

25:28.529 --> 25:31.448
It is not too late for that, Austin.

25:31.532 --> 25:34.159
We can fix this.
You just have to apologize to Dad.

25:35.160 --> 25:39.039
I have no intention of ever speaking
to that man again.

25:39.122 --> 25:40.123
You cannot mean that.

25:41.625 --> 25:42.626
I do mean it.

25:43.460 --> 25:45.671
This is a house divided, Emily.

25:46.421 --> 25:49.842
And sooner or later,
you're gonna have to pick sides.
