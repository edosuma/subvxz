WEBVTT

00:26.568 --> 00:28.278
What is it that haunts you?

00:31.448 --> 00:34.325
Whose eyes peer at you from the dark?

00:41.624 --> 00:43.043
I think he went this way.

00:43.793 --> 00:44.627
Over there.

00:45.795 --> 00:47.422
-Get him.
-He's over there.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.217
-Let's get him.
-You're screwed.

00:51.301 --> 00:53.219
-Come on. Over here.
-We got him.

00:53.303 --> 00:54.888
-Let's get him.
-Come on.

01:16.117 --> 01:18.369
You belong out here with the animals.

01:21.790 --> 01:23.958
We better not see you
in town again.

01:24.459 --> 01:27.879
-You hear me?

01:34.469 --> 01:36.888
What?

01:38.389 --> 01:40.391
Are you gonna run back to your mommy?

02:08.753 --> 02:10.421
-That's enough.

02:15.718 --> 02:18.555
-But they jumped me.
-It doesn't matter.

02:19.180 --> 02:20.765
Know when to stop.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.188
It's time to go home.

02:35.238 --> 02:36.573
They started it.

02:36.656 --> 02:38.950
They've been picking on me for weeks.

02:40.410 --> 02:41.870
We'll discuss this at home.

02:43.037 --> 02:46.166
You have much to learn, Jin Kazama.

03:57.153 --> 03:59.197
They say I don't belong there.

03:59.280 --> 04:00.114
Jin,

04:02.200 --> 04:03.451
have you ever thought

04:04.285 --> 04:06.621
that it's because you don't belong?

04:06.704 --> 04:08.456
Thanks, Mom.

04:09.165 --> 04:10.541
Way to make me feel better.

04:11.167 --> 04:15.463
Jin, those kids resent you because
they're never gonna leave this place.

04:15.546 --> 04:20.093
Yeah, they grow up here,
they… they live here, and they die here,

04:20.176 --> 04:21.219
while you…

04:22.553 --> 04:25.223
you're meant for more in this life.

04:25.306 --> 04:27.141
And deep down, they know that.

04:32.897 --> 04:36.985
One day you'll leave this island,
you'll travel, you'll see the world,

04:37.068 --> 04:39.988
and, I have no doubt,
accomplish great things.

04:45.201 --> 04:47.912
You shouldn't have hurt them.

04:49.580 --> 04:51.791
You've been training
in the Kazama fighting style

04:51.874 --> 04:54.460
long enough to defend yourself
without hurting them,

04:55.044 --> 04:57.171
and that's what disappoints me.

04:57.255 --> 04:58.923
You lost a fight today, Jin.

05:00.133 --> 05:00.967
No, I didn't.

05:02.885 --> 05:05.221
You lost the fight
with yourself, Jin.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.974
The battle against your anger.

05:08.057 --> 05:11.978
-I know you're better than that.

05:17.275 --> 05:20.695
I know I've asked this before,
but why did we move here?

05:22.447 --> 05:23.698
Never forget, Jin,

05:24.282 --> 05:27.577
the world is filled
with both good and evil.

05:27.660 --> 05:33.333
We moved here so I could make sure
you experience good before anything else.

05:34.375 --> 05:37.337
How come
we never really talk about my dad?

05:39.297 --> 05:41.716
Let's get back to your studies,
young man.

05:41.799 --> 05:44.635
You pick, English or math lesson first.

05:44.719 --> 05:47.972
Can't we just train
or do some kicking drills or something?

05:48.556 --> 05:50.808
Oh, you've done enough fighting today.

05:52.226 --> 05:54.771
Besides, strong mind…

05:55.813 --> 05:57.440
…strong body.

06:17.877 --> 06:18.836
-Ha!

06:23.216 --> 06:24.050
Hm.

06:34.394 --> 06:39.065
Remember, dear, the first opponent
you must defeat in any fight is yourself.

06:39.982 --> 06:41.734
You must conquer your thoughts.

06:42.610 --> 06:44.362
If you're distracted,
how are you gonna see

06:44.445 --> 06:46.531
the clear path to defeating someone else?

06:48.282 --> 06:51.536
Always focus on the immediate moment.

06:52.036 --> 06:53.871
Not your day before,

06:53.955 --> 06:56.249
not the outcome you want later.

06:58.209 --> 07:02.296
The only thing that should exist
is the technique, the form.

07:03.798 --> 07:05.800
When you have mastered the moment,

07:06.801 --> 07:08.344
then, and only then,

07:08.428 --> 07:10.138
can you start moving ahead.

07:17.645 --> 07:21.023
Remember, you can counter
any opponent's size and strength

07:21.107 --> 07:23.151
with surprise and technique.

07:23.234 --> 07:24.444
For instance…

07:49.343 --> 07:52.388
The Kazama Ryu-un-tsui Technique.

07:52.472 --> 07:55.141
-Whoa.
-Didn't see that coming?

07:55.850 --> 07:56.684
No.

07:57.560 --> 07:58.644
Hmm.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.646
Let's practice it.

08:52.823 --> 08:55.117
Good, you're getting it.

08:55.868 --> 08:58.246
-Keep practicing.
-Yes, ma'am.

08:59.497 --> 09:04.377
Now, time to battle another opponent
all fighters will eventually face.

09:04.460 --> 09:05.336
Who's that?

09:05.920 --> 09:06.754
Hunger.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.058
What did you eat
when you were in Africa?

09:19.141 --> 09:21.769
Uh, did they have fish and rice?
Stuff we eat?

09:22.687 --> 09:24.146
It was different,

09:24.230 --> 09:27.066
but we had all kinds
of great food on safari.

09:27.650 --> 09:31.028
I wish I could've brought
the WWWC cooks back with me.

09:32.029 --> 09:35.241
-They were culinary ex--
-I wanna talk to that boy!

09:36.826 --> 09:40.788
I said I wanna talk to that boy.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.460
Look what he did!

09:46.961 --> 09:48.671
Attacked my boy.

09:49.338 --> 09:53.009
Someone oughta teach that kid
some respect!

09:54.677 --> 09:55.928
They jumped me.

09:56.846 --> 10:00.182
-They always pick fights with me.
-Remember what I said.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.768
Control your anger.

10:03.728 --> 10:05.521
Don't let it control you.

10:07.481 --> 10:10.318
I want you to apologize
to the young man for hurting him.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.239
We should take ownership of our actions.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.366
Apologize.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.994
Ain't good enough.

10:20.077 --> 10:23.789
Maybe you had a man in that house,

10:24.415 --> 10:26.125
the boy'd know better.

10:28.836 --> 10:30.880
-Shut your mouth, you old--
-Jin.

10:32.214 --> 10:36.927
Boy… needs to learn… some manners.

10:37.011 --> 10:38.012
Dad, don't.

10:38.095 --> 10:40.931
Maybe… I'll teach him!

10:52.568 --> 10:55.154
Young man, take your father home.

10:58.282 --> 10:59.659
Jin, back inside.

11:03.663 --> 11:04.914
Yes, ma'am.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.588
-You know, Jin,

11:13.172 --> 11:16.092
we should never take pleasure
in the suffering of others.

11:16.175 --> 11:19.845
I saw you smile
when I disarmed and defeated Mr. Hirai.

11:20.429 --> 11:22.723
The most important thing I can teach you

11:22.807 --> 11:26.852
is to control your anger
and use whatever power you have for good.

11:26.936 --> 11:29.105
You have a gift.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.191
You are a Kazama.

11:32.274 --> 11:35.945
And it's important to me
that you use that gift for good.

11:40.574 --> 11:41.534
I will, Mother.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.370
I promise.

11:45.079 --> 11:46.455
And that block?

11:48.124 --> 11:51.419
I just redirected his force
and used his body weight against him.

11:52.336 --> 11:53.713
The rest was up to gravity.

12:04.306 --> 12:05.141
An animal?

12:08.811 --> 12:09.645
Demon.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.075
Mom?

12:24.118 --> 12:25.661
Jin, listen to me.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.872
Stay in the house.

12:27.955 --> 12:31.500
You are not to come out, no matter what.

12:33.669 --> 12:35.171
-But--
-No.

12:36.005 --> 12:40.551
If anything happens to me,
I want you to go find your grandfather,

12:41.135 --> 12:42.762
Heihachi Mishima.

12:47.641 --> 12:50.686
Sometimes life calls for defense,

12:51.353 --> 12:53.439
sometimes for offense.

12:53.522 --> 12:58.110
Promise me you'll always know
when to use which.

13:02.448 --> 13:03.407
I promise.

13:14.376 --> 13:16.086
Why are you here?

14:39.253 --> 14:41.297
Jin, go!

14:55.769 --> 14:57.479
Jin, run!

15:49.865 --> 15:50.699
Demon!

16:00.668 --> 16:01.502
Hm.

16:30.197 --> 16:31.281
Yah!

16:50.551 --> 16:53.262
<i> I love you, Jin.</i>

17:24.585 --> 17:25.419
No.

17:34.803 --> 17:35.888
Mom?

17:38.390 --> 17:39.266
Mom!

17:40.684 --> 17:41.935
Where are you?

17:58.285 --> 18:00.162
No.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.069
Where do you think you're going?

18:33.153 --> 18:35.239
<i>He keeps trying to get into the building.</i>

18:35.823 --> 18:37.950
<i>This is the third time this week.</i>

18:38.033 --> 18:38.951
<i> Thank you.</i>

18:39.493 --> 18:42.788
<i>I'll, uh, handle it from here.</i>

18:42.871 --> 18:43.747
<i> Yes, sir.</i>

18:47.167 --> 18:49.378
You've snuck into the wrong place, kid.

18:50.754 --> 18:52.881
I'm trying to find my grandfather.

18:53.632 --> 18:56.635
I doubt you're related to anyone
in this building.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.638
-My name is Jin Kazama.

18:59.721 --> 19:02.683
Heihachi Mishima is my grandfather.

19:02.766 --> 19:03.642
Kazama.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.617
What do you want?

19:21.660 --> 19:23.412
Uh… yes, sir.

19:23.912 --> 19:27.374
There have been incidents with an intruder
trying to sneak into the building.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.710
An intruder?

19:30.961 --> 19:34.423
All I see is a street rat

19:34.506 --> 19:37.676
that, thanks to you, has wandered in.

19:38.385 --> 19:41.305
I'm no rat, and I'm no child.

19:41.930 --> 19:44.308
My mother sent me here to find you.

19:45.100 --> 19:46.768
I'm Jin Kazama.

19:48.729 --> 19:49.980
Kazama?

19:54.693 --> 19:58.864
The son of Jun Kazama?

19:58.947 --> 20:03.535
She said… you're my grandfather.

20:05.078 --> 20:08.081
Leave the boy here with me.

20:08.165 --> 20:10.083
Uh… yes, sir.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.431
Fight me.

20:25.140 --> 20:25.974
What?

20:26.058 --> 20:29.519
Do not make me repeat myself.

20:30.938 --> 20:33.232
I didn't come here to fight you.

20:34.816 --> 20:36.985
I said, fight.

20:37.986 --> 20:41.073
I was taught never to fight
unless attacked.

20:45.285 --> 20:47.913
There. You've been attacked.

20:47.996 --> 20:49.831
Now, fight.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.505
Again. Attack.

21:04.972 --> 21:05.931
Up.

21:07.391 --> 21:09.476
I said, up.

21:30.956 --> 21:33.709
If your name is indeed Kazama…

21:35.711 --> 21:38.880
you bring dishonor to it.

21:39.464 --> 21:40.674
Leave.

21:41.174 --> 21:43.427
And don't bother me again.

21:46.388 --> 21:47.723
-Hmm.

21:47.806 --> 21:50.809
You're not worth my time.

21:54.896 --> 21:58.650
Before that green monster
killed my mother,

21:58.734 --> 22:00.569
she told me to find you.

22:00.652 --> 22:05.657
She made me promise
to find my grandfather, Heihachi Mishima.

22:06.241 --> 22:08.660
I won't leave.

22:09.369 --> 22:11.371
What did you say?

22:12.289 --> 22:13.957
You said "green."

22:15.167 --> 22:16.376
You've seen it.

22:16.460 --> 22:19.254
It came for us, and it killed my mother.

22:20.422 --> 22:25.677
And with or without your help,
I'll find it, and I'll kill it.

22:26.887 --> 22:29.556
The creature that killed your mother

22:30.557 --> 22:32.934
is known as Ogre.

22:33.018 --> 22:36.938
-I will train you to fight him.

22:37.814 --> 22:41.777
I will train you to defeat him.

22:42.819 --> 22:48.492
In return, you will prove to me
you're worthy of your ancestry,

22:49.993 --> 22:53.121
even if it kills you.
