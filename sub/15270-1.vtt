00:29.880 --> 00:33.077
Since there is no reconciliation, we proceed.

00:33.160 --> 00:36.436
You will please stand
with your backs to one another.

00:37.400 --> 00:41.109
It may amuse you to know, monsieur,
I never believed you cheated at cards.

00:41.200 --> 00:43.350
Maybe I don't have your sense of humour.

00:43.440 --> 00:46.034
There's a lady who prefers
your attentions to mine.

00:46.120 --> 00:48.554
I intend to simplify her choice.

00:48.640 --> 00:50.835
Rachel?

00:50.920 --> 00:52.717
Margot? No.

00:52.800 --> 00:55.917
When I begin to count,
you will each take ten paces.

00:56.960 --> 00:59.269
You will turn and fire on the count of ten.

00:59.360 --> 01:02.238
If either man stops or turns
before the count is complete,

01:02.320 --> 01:05.072
it will be my distasteful duty
to shoot him down.

01:05.160 --> 01:06.798
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

01:06.880 --> 01:08.836
One, two, three,

01:08.920 --> 01:11.718
four, five, six, seven,

01:11.800 --> 01:13.791
eight, nine, ten.

01:25.320 --> 01:29.313
Fool. If he hadn't stepped aside,
I'd have hit him in the shoulder.

01:35.960 --> 01:38.030
Many of us will be sorry to see you hang.

01:38.120 --> 01:41.908
Hang? They've never enforced
the laws against duelling before.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.310
The son of Judge Beaubien
has never been killed before.

01:45.400 --> 01:49.393
Most certainly he will have you arrested
and hanged before the week is out.

01:49.480 --> 01:52.313
I'm sorry. It will take
the incentive out of duelling.

01:52.400 --> 01:54.834
I wouldn't wanna
spoil it for the rest of you.

01:54.920 --> 01:57.480
When one has proven himself
on the field of honour,

01:57.560 --> 02:01.269
one cannot turn tail and run
like a common criminal, can one?

02:01.360 --> 02:03.316
One can.

04:19.920 --> 04:22.275
Paul Regret, cabin 39.

04:49.320 --> 04:51.151
Well?

04:51.240 --> 04:54.232
I sent you to do an errand, Amelung.

04:54.320 --> 04:58.632
He's registered as Paul Regret,
cabin number 39. He has no luggage.

04:59.720 --> 05:03.759
You could have met this handsome chap
without sending me to snoop out his name.

05:03.840 --> 05:07.071
I think you just want to humiliate me.

05:07.160 --> 05:09.958
I'll not need either of you until morning.

05:32.520 --> 05:35.273
13, black, odd. No winner.

05:44.480 --> 05:47.870
- 23, please.
- 23 it is.

05:47.960 --> 05:50.394
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.471
Place your bets, please.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.876
Five outside.

05:54.960 --> 05:57.793
Nine inside. The winner, nine.
Nobody there.

05:58.880 --> 06:00.034
Place your bets, please.

06:00.650 --> 06:03.477
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.

06:03.760 --> 06:05.751
King outside.

06:06.440 --> 06:10.558
Six inside. Winner six.
Guess it isn't your night, sir.

06:10.640 --> 06:13.029
23, red and high. A winner!

06:14.840 --> 06:17.513
Madame! Madame has won.

06:18.720 --> 06:21.393
- Thank you.
- Pardon me, young lady.

06:21.480 --> 06:25.439
But the one value of my white hair
is that I may address beautiful women

06:25.520 --> 06:27.875
without being thought presumptuous.

06:27.960 --> 06:30.315
Will you favour an old man with this waltz?

06:30.400 --> 06:32.789
Thank you, but this dance is taken.

06:33.600 --> 06:36.194
And here's the gentleman who has it.

06:38.200 --> 06:41.909
Surely you remember
we have this dance, Mr Regret?

06:42.000 --> 06:45.913
I have a poor memory,
but not for matters of utmost importance.

06:46.880 --> 06:49.474
- Excuse us, sir.
- With envy, young man.

06:55.320 --> 06:59.552
Thank you, Mr Regret.
You saved me from a dreary fate.

06:59.640 --> 07:01.312
He is a darling, but I...

07:01.400 --> 07:05.393
I am happy I was on the spot
when you found yourself in such difficulty.

07:05.480 --> 07:07.710
How did you know my name?

07:07.800 --> 07:11.349
That was fortunate.
I heard the head waiter address you.

07:16.560 --> 07:21.236
I dare say the salon will be full of cigar smoke
and loud talk about the price of cotton.

07:21.320 --> 07:23.231
Salons usually are at this hour.

07:23.320 --> 07:26.232
<i>Too bad. I would like a glass of wine.</i>

07:26.720 --> 07:28.915
May I suggest my cabin?

07:29.000 --> 07:31.878
Frankly, I prefer my cabin.

07:31.960 --> 07:35.839
Shall we say number 127 in half an hour?

07:42.960 --> 07:45.349
It wasn't fair of me to come here.

07:46.400 --> 07:49.392
- Fair?
- I'm not worth the effort.

07:49.480 --> 07:51.835
I haven't been lucky at the tables.

07:51.920 --> 07:53.911
What do you take me for?

07:54.960 --> 07:58.555
A liar, to start with.
A beautiful liar, but a liar nevertheless.

07:58.640 --> 08:01.757
No waiter has so far called me by my name.

08:01.840 --> 08:05.196
I'm sorry, my dear.
But when the irate husband appears,

08:05.280 --> 08:08.716
you'll find the contents
of my pocket not worth your trouble.

08:08.800 --> 08:11.553
- You think me a blackmailer?
- Or whatever.

08:11.640 --> 08:15.030
Whatever your game is,
the trophy is not worth the chase.

08:15.120 --> 08:18.749
- Look at my hand, please.
- It's very graceful.

08:19.120 --> 08:23.318
The smallest stone in that ring
could buy and sell you, Paul Regret.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.391
Why should I want money from you?

08:25.480 --> 08:29.109
Experience has taught me
to look carefully at a gift horse.

08:29.200 --> 08:33.557
Am I to believe you weighed, appraised and
selected me out of all the men on the boat?

08:33.640 --> 08:35.756
Do not be too conceited.

08:35.840 --> 08:38.229
It's not a very large boat.

08:38.320 --> 08:41.835
We certainly have picked
a wonderful evening to fall in love.

08:41.919 --> 08:46.789
Don't be ordinary. What passes between
us tonight has nothing to do with love.

08:46.880 --> 08:48.871
You don't believe that love exists?

08:48.960 --> 08:53.431
I believe this very night, all over the world,
men and women are saying to each other

08:53.520 --> 08:58.036
"I love you" when what
they really mean is "I desire you".

08:59.240 --> 09:01.390
You are a very unusual woman.

09:01.480 --> 09:03.630
It is unusual to be honest.

09:03.720 --> 09:06.075
I like independent women,

09:06.160 --> 09:09.755
but I also want the right
to be able to choose my own.

09:11.640 --> 09:13.631
Mr Regret.

09:13.720 --> 09:17.759
You like independent women
and I admire men who can't be bought.

09:18.400 --> 09:20.630
I think we've misjudged each other.

09:20.720 --> 09:23.109
It's three days to Galveston.

09:23.200 --> 09:25.191
Shall we start again?

09:29.520 --> 09:31.317
To the beginning.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.911
Wh... What?

10:36.480 --> 10:38.471
$300 for a suit of clothes.

10:39.320 --> 10:41.880
Where I come from,
we could outfit 30 men for that.

10:41.960 --> 10:44.554
- Who are you?
- The name's Cutter. Jake Cutter.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.471
Cap'n Texas Rangers.

10:46.560 --> 10:50.519
This tailor's gonna be mighty unhappy
when he don't get his money.

10:50.600 --> 10:56.391
Course, he'll get a lot of advertising.
You wearing that $300 suit onto the gallows.

10:56.480 --> 10:59.677
- You can't do this.
- Well, now, let's see.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.830
This here says Monsewer Paul Regret.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.832
- That's Mr Paul Regret in English, ain't it?
- Yes.

11:04.920 --> 11:08.310
- You're under arrest.
- I've committed no crime in Texas.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.994
Right. But you killed a man in Louisiana.

11:11.080 --> 11:15.312
I'm taking you to the ranger headquarters
where a Louisiana marshal will pick you up,

11:15.400 --> 11:18.233
take you back to New Orleans
and the gallows.

11:18.320 --> 11:22.313
We're getting real obliging
to the states down here in Texas.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.600
A lot of folks want to join the Union.

11:25.680 --> 11:28.478
There's a couple of hundred
in gold in thatjacket.

11:28.560 --> 11:31.438
Does that give you any ideas, friend?

11:31.520 --> 11:34.512
I've got what you might consider a weakness.

11:35.720 --> 11:40.475
I'm honest.
You start getting into that $300 suit.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.551
And I ain't your friend.

11:57.280 --> 12:01.956
Give me a minute to talk to someone.
It's very important. A girl.

12:02.040 --> 12:03.758
Have a heart, friend.

12:03.840 --> 12:06.991
I've been trying to explain
to you that I ain't your friend.

12:07.080 --> 12:10.868
But I don't want anyone to accuse me
of not having a heart.

12:10.960 --> 12:13.315
I'd like it if she didn't have to see these.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.391
Hide 'em in that hat.

12:17.200 --> 12:18.599
Oh, uh...

12:18.680 --> 12:23.071
I wouldn't try any city-slicker stuff
on this poor old country boy.

12:49.760 --> 12:52.149
- Well, she's gone.
- Anybody can see that.

12:52.240 --> 12:53.639
She said it was for ever.

12:53.720 --> 12:57.190
Looks like country boys
aren't the only ones who get lied to by gals.

12:57.280 --> 13:00.636
I'll turn Galveston upside down. I'll find her.

13:00.720 --> 13:03.075
You're sort of forgetting, Monsewer.

13:03.160 --> 13:05.151
I got a prior claim.

13:16.040 --> 13:18.031
Regret.

13:18.640 --> 13:20.637
Monsewer Paul Regret.

13:29.480 --> 13:32.631
- You say this trip'll take five days?
- Right. Step aboard.

13:32.720 --> 13:34.551
- What, on this mule?
- On the mule.

13:34.640 --> 13:37.359
- Riding him's gonna slow us down.
- Very sad.

13:37.440 --> 13:42.560
But if you were to take off for the tall
and uncut, I could run you down real easy.

13:45.120 --> 13:48.112
- How we gonna eat?
- Ever been out in the fresh air?

13:48.200 --> 13:52.671
A side of bacon, beans,
a coffee pot and a frying pan?

13:52.760 --> 13:56.639
- All the comforts of home.
- Yeah. All the comforts of home.

13:56.720 --> 14:00.633
I'm beginning to hate this mule already.
He's got a mean look.

14:00.720 --> 14:02.711
His name is Mabel.

14:03.720 --> 14:05.711
Well, come on, Mabel.

14:31.680 --> 14:33.671
Break out the coffee.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.391
It's in your saddlebag.

14:36.480 --> 14:38.914
Get it.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.991
All right.

14:42.160 --> 14:44.549
Unless you want this salt pork burned.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.589
Captain Jake.

15:17.480 --> 15:20.916
My friend, you're a very brave man.

15:27.960 --> 15:31.555
And pretty soon you're gonna
catch on I ain't your friend.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.591
Captain Jake.

15:43.160 --> 15:46.675
It's getting very tiresome
lugging this saddle around.

15:46.760 --> 15:50.514
I don't suppose you'd take my word
of honour that I won't try to escape?

15:50.600 --> 15:53.751
Monsewer, you are a lulu.

16:06.880 --> 16:10.873
<i>What do you find that's so interesting
about this miserable country?</i>

16:10.960 --> 16:13.633
I used to own a cattle spread over there.

16:13.720 --> 16:16.314
- You were a rancher?
- Yeah.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.709
2,000 head of longhorn.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.711
Indians run you out?

16:20.800 --> 16:23.553
No. They weren't any trouble then.

16:23.640 --> 16:25.870
Not till a few years ago.

16:25.960 --> 16:27.916
Something's stirrin' them up now.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.709
- The drought get you?
- My wife died.

16:31.800 --> 16:33.358
Oh.

16:33.440 --> 16:34.714
That's unfortunate.

16:34.800 --> 16:38.713
So I gave the spread
to some right nice people.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.474
Folks that used to work for me.

16:42.560 --> 16:45.597
Well, I personally could never see marriage.

16:45.680 --> 16:50.919
Seems like a fella'd always feel that curiosity
about the next woman he was going to meet.

16:51.040 --> 16:52.720
Lots feel that way.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.791
Did once myself.

16:58.400 --> 17:00.391
Hold it.

17:02.320 --> 17:04.310
That's an Indian sign.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.196
You're gonna live a lot longer
if you follow after me. Ya!

18:11.720 --> 18:14.712
I expect we'll find the little girl inside.

18:14.800 --> 18:17.075
Did you know these people?

18:17.160 --> 18:19.993
Rode many a night herd with all of 'em.

18:21.120 --> 18:23.509
I was at the baby's christening.

18:46.360 --> 18:49.318
I guess that's about all we can do for 'em.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.391
I hate to do this...

19:46.080 --> 19:49.629
Hey, Jake, that's a pretty
good-looking mount you got there.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.711
<i>(laughter)</i>

19:52.680 --> 19:55.558
Hi, Jake. You been horse-trading?

19:56.400 --> 19:58.391
How come you're riding a mule?

19:59.400 --> 20:02.710
Because I took to liking mules.
You got any objection?

20:02.800 --> 20:05.439
- No, sir.
- Or you? Or you?

20:05.520 --> 20:07.317
No, not me.

20:15.920 --> 20:19.913
- Hello, Tobe. Major wanted to see me.
- He'll be right back.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.991
Say, how do you spell "Louisiana"?

20:22.080 --> 20:24.469
L-o-u-i...

20:24.560 --> 20:27.996
- What do you wanna know for?
- I'm writing my pa a letter.

20:28.080 --> 20:31.755
"Captain Jake went to pick up
a prisoner wanted by the state of Louisiana".

20:31.840 --> 20:35.435
"He came back with a mule
and a split head and no prisoner".

20:35.520 --> 20:38.398
I might have a "PS" for your pa.

20:38.480 --> 20:43.474
"Dear Mulehead. We didn't beat this boy
enough when he was growing up".

20:45.480 --> 20:46.799
- Major.
- Hi, Jake.

20:46.880 --> 20:49.314
- I got a little surprise for you.
- Yeah?

20:49.400 --> 20:53.518
Yeah. Something that may prove that theory
you've been bending our ears with.

20:53.600 --> 20:56.558
- You mean a gang running the Comanches?
- Yeah.

20:56.640 --> 20:59.200
Picked up a fella with a wagonload of guns.

20:59.280 --> 21:01.271
Come on back here.

21:05.640 --> 21:07.437
I'm sorry.

21:07.520 --> 21:10.478
Between you and me,
I feel a sight better I was stopped.

21:10.560 --> 21:14.473
Stopped before I went off and done
some fool thing I might be ashamed of.

21:14.560 --> 21:18.553
Like them guns. Wouldn't be right
if they fell into the wrong hands.

21:18.795 --> 21:20.252
Might even got to the Comanches

21:20.352 --> 21:23.436
Now I look back on it,
I can see how bad it was.

21:23.520 --> 21:25.636
That's how come that I give myself up.

21:25.720 --> 21:30.316
Yup. After breaking one ranger's jaw and
slicing up two others with a bowie knife.

21:30.400 --> 21:32.356
I feel bad about that.

21:32.440 --> 21:34.431
I wasn't using my head.

21:34.520 --> 21:37.592
You used everything else.
Feet, fists and teeth.

21:37.680 --> 21:41.116
Yes, sir.
But them rangers sure won me over.

21:41.200 --> 21:45.478
If I'd have knowed men like that, I might
never have fell in with bad companions.

21:45.560 --> 21:48.996
Those are the fellas we wanna hear about,
those bad companions.

21:49.080 --> 21:53.073
And it's my Christian duty
to tell you everything I know.

21:53.160 --> 21:55.628
Which ain't nothin'.

21:55.720 --> 21:59.076
Well, the truth is I ran into a man in Yuma.

21:59.160 --> 22:01.958
He said I'd get the best price
for my guns in Sweetwater.

22:02.040 --> 22:06.716
Said if I'd go down to Sweetwater,
check in a hotel, I'd be got in touch with.

22:06.800 --> 22:11.112
But I never did find out who.
And that's the gospel truth.

22:11.200 --> 22:13.794
You still don't know where
you got those guns.

22:13.880 --> 22:16.917
I've been beatin' my head tryin' to remember.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.639
If I could only find that bill o' sale.

22:19.720 --> 22:23.030
Those guns were stolen from
the quartermaster depot on Fort Sill.

22:23.120 --> 22:28.319
No! Well, then the man who sold 'em to me,
he must have been mixed up in it.

22:28.400 --> 22:31.836
If I'd have knowed that,
I sure would have reported it.

22:31.920 --> 22:36.835
I think he's telling the truth about one thing.
It's the first time he brought guns into Texas.

22:36.920 --> 22:40.310
And the last. Bless you for believing me, sir.

22:41.080 --> 22:44.789
I believe you because I know
where you spent the last five years.

22:44.880 --> 22:47.997
- The Yuma Territorial Prison.
- Well, yes, sir.

22:48.080 --> 22:51.470
But they had a right to lock me up.
I done a bad thing.

22:51.560 --> 22:55.075
What with me not never having
no schooling and knowing no better.

22:55.160 --> 22:58.709
But now I'm all straightened out.
I been saved by the law.

23:00.040 --> 23:03.476
Maybe the Comanche contact man
won't know him by sight.

23:05.160 --> 23:10.553
You want me to take his place? Take the guns
to Sweetwater and meet the contact man?

23:10.640 --> 23:12.949
Hey, that ain't a bad idea.

23:13.040 --> 23:18.068
And you're sure welcome to use
my name, sir. McBain. Ed McBain.

23:18.720 --> 23:22.395
Maybe that'll make up some
for the way I almost disgraced it.

23:23.160 --> 23:26.516
<i>Think of me being mixed up with them.</i>

23:26.600 --> 23:29.956
Me, who ain't never been
in no trouble before.

23:30.040 --> 23:33.794
- Well, not hardly.
- All right, McBain.

23:33.880 --> 23:37.998
Just a minute. Might wanna
do a little readin' tonight.

23:38.080 --> 23:40.992
Either one of you gentlemen
got an extra Bible?

24:44.720 --> 24:48.872
Oh, sure, Mr McBain!
We been holding the room for ten days.

24:48.960 --> 24:50.951
Never knew when you might be gettin' in.

24:51.040 --> 24:53.793
- Reckon that'll cost me extra.
- Won't cost you nothin'.

24:53.880 --> 24:55.552
- It's all been taken care of.
- Oh?

24:55.640 --> 24:58.837
Yes, sir, Your friend says
to tell you your money ain't no good.

24:58.920 --> 25:02.549
Says anything you want's on him.
It's one of the best rooms in the house.

25:02.640 --> 25:06.155
Says to stay tight, spraddle out,
and you'll be got in touch with.

25:06.240 --> 25:09.835
That's room 19.
That's right up on the first floor, sir.

25:14.560 --> 25:16.551
That's right, sir.

25:28.920 --> 25:31.036
- Am I in the right place?
- I guess so.

25:31.120 --> 25:33.350
We were supposed to meet two gentlemen.

25:33.440 --> 25:35.635
Well, ladies, you're halfway home.

25:35.720 --> 25:37.597
Ed McBain at your service.

25:37.680 --> 25:40.956
I'm Adabelle La Domergue
and this is my friend Guadalupe.

25:41.040 --> 25:44.157
Guadalupe Felipa Carmela López de Reyes.

25:44.240 --> 25:48.597
- Fuzzy for short.
- Well, it's delightful to meet you, Fuzzy.

25:48.680 --> 25:51.399
- Who provided the refreshments?
- I really don't know.

25:51.480 --> 25:54.233
They were already here
when we ladies arrived.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.151
Well, a toast to him, anyway.

25:56.240 --> 26:01.633
Mr McBain, I just want you to know that
we don't usually go out on blind dates but...

26:01.720 --> 26:03.438
<i>(banging)</i>

26:03.520 --> 26:05.238
Oh, no.

26:05.320 --> 26:08.710
I... I'm afraid we have a previous engagement.

26:11.080 --> 26:13.389
Last time we had the pleasure
of your company,

26:13.480 --> 26:16.916
we was involved in four fistfights,
a stabbing and a shooting...

26:17.000 --> 26:18.513
and all before midnight!

26:18.600 --> 26:20.591
Yee-ha!

26:21.560 --> 26:25.678
McBain, what'd you do with them guns?
I tore your wagon apart and I didn't find 'em.

26:25.760 --> 26:27.876
I found a false bottom but no guns.

26:27.960 --> 26:30.315
- You got 'em or ain't you got 'em?
- I buried 'em.

26:30.400 --> 26:33.233
You what? What kind of
a sneakin' somethin' is that?

26:33.320 --> 26:36.312
That is a damn distrustful way
to start off a deal.

26:36.960 --> 26:40.316
I didn't want 'em to fall into the wrong hands.

26:43.720 --> 26:47.918
Well, you got me there.
But you're dealing with the right party now.

26:50.040 --> 26:52.031
The name's Tully Crow.

26:56.120 --> 26:59.078
You ain't done thatjug much damage.
Mind if I help myself?

26:59.160 --> 27:00.479
- Go ahead.
- Snuff?

27:00.560 --> 27:02.551
Cigar man.

27:07.440 --> 27:09.431
<i>(snorts)</i>

27:11.280 --> 27:13.475
Buried them guns, huh?

27:13.560 --> 27:16.393
That was smart. Real inspitorial.

27:16.480 --> 27:19.313
Six crates of rifles. Yeah.

27:19.400 --> 27:22.597
You figured somebody
mightjust take 'em on approval.

27:22.680 --> 27:24.910
Could've cooked the goose
that lays the golden eggs.

27:25.000 --> 27:25.989
How's that?

27:26.080 --> 27:30.995
If I hadn't made the right contact here,
I'd have to sell the rest of 'em someplace else.

27:31.080 --> 27:34.038
- You got more?
- Steady supply.

27:34.120 --> 27:36.076
Now that is somethin' I never knew.

27:36.160 --> 27:39.835
So you can see how important it was
to both of us to get started off right.

27:39.920 --> 27:44.311
Yeah. I'll give you $100 for every gun you got.

27:45.640 --> 27:48.712
I understand the Comanches
pay five times that. What's this?

27:48.800 --> 27:51.917
Leave that be. If I'd had that then,
I wouldn't have this now.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.878
- You ever dealt with a Comanche direct?
- Can't say I have.

27:54.960 --> 27:58.032
I did. They took everything
I had to sell and went after this.

27:58.120 --> 27:59.917
What stopped 'em?

28:00.000 --> 28:04.391
- Comancheros. Fellas I'm dealing with now.
- Comancheros?

28:04.480 --> 28:07.916
That's right. Fellas with real fine
connections with the Comanche.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.958
They needed me.
I had a steady supply, just like you.

28:11.040 --> 28:15.318
Only it ran out. So now
I'm willing to take on a partner.

28:15.400 --> 28:17.470
When do we meet these Comancheros?

28:18.200 --> 28:20.634
You don't. I do.

28:20.720 --> 28:23.439
No good. I go where these guns go.

28:23.520 --> 28:26.512
- Why?
- You're the only partner I got.

28:26.600 --> 28:27.999
Or will have.

28:28.080 --> 28:30.799
If anything happens to you,
I'm out of business.

28:30.880 --> 28:35.351
That's right. So nothing better
happen to me, huh, partner?

28:35.440 --> 28:40.468
So wrap yourself around your half of this jug
and we'll go out on this town and celebrate.

28:46.920 --> 28:50.913
# Now the moon shines tonight
on pretty Red Wing

28:51.000 --> 28:53.230
# The breeze is sighing

28:53.320 --> 28:55.880
# The night bird's crying

28:55.960 --> 28:58.030
# Far away 'neath the stars

28:58.120 --> 29:00.429
# Her love is sleeping

29:00.520 --> 29:03.592
# While Red Wing's weeping

29:03.680 --> 29:08.390
# Her heart away

29:09.000 --> 29:13.312
How'd you like that, darling? Hearing
my voice sound like a golden trumpet.

29:13.400 --> 29:17.029
Come on, you swamp-toed jungle rat!
Let's get ajug up here.

29:17.960 --> 29:21.396
All right, all right.
Don't get bored. I'm bringing it.

29:22.240 --> 29:24.231
Not that stuff! The good stuff.

29:24.320 --> 29:27.995
- This is the good stuff!
- You think me and my partner are blind?

29:32.120 --> 29:36.033
Just walk slow, boys.
Go home to your firesides bright, huh?

29:36.120 --> 29:40.113
- You shoot pretty good drunk.
- Better drunk than sober.

29:40.200 --> 29:42.668
You know what the secret it?

29:42.760 --> 29:45.513
Soothingness. That's right. Soothingness.

29:49.120 --> 29:53.110
- You see something I don't see?
- No, sir. I don't see nothing.

29:53.560 --> 29:56.233
- You're looking at my scalp, huh?
- No, sir. I ain't.

29:56.320 --> 30:00.632
Well, I still got it, no thanks to you.
And right up here on top where it counts.

30:00.720 --> 30:03.314
If you don't like it,
you can do something about it.

30:03.640 --> 30:05.551
I like it! Very much.

30:05.640 --> 30:09.076
You like it very much?
Maybe I can fix yours the same way.

30:14.560 --> 30:16.551
Beat it.

30:23.880 --> 30:27.509
- What'd you do that for?
- Soothingness, partner.

30:29.920 --> 30:32.388
- Good old McBain. Partners.
- Partners.

30:32.480 --> 30:34.550
Share and share alike.

30:43.240 --> 30:47.313
And by that crimson settin' sun
Peace come to Forest Glade

30:47.400 --> 30:51.518
And of the redskins there was none
For history had been made.

31:00.360 --> 31:02.999
Partner. You win.

31:03.080 --> 31:05.913
You fight a good fight, Ed.
I gotta give you that.

31:07.280 --> 31:11.751
A little quiet around here. Why don't you and
me go someplace we can have some fun?

31:11.840 --> 31:13.831
- Get a steak.
- Good idea.

31:14.560 --> 31:19.395
# Oh, the moon shines tonight
on pretty Red Wing

31:19.480 --> 31:21.516
# On pretty Red Wing

31:21.600 --> 31:23.591
# The breeze is sighing...

31:43.560 --> 31:45.755
McBain.

31:45.840 --> 31:48.877
I'm only as drunk as I wanna be, same as you.

31:51.360 --> 31:53.351
Right, partner.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.433
How we gonna round out the evenin'?

31:57.520 --> 31:59.511
- Cigar?
- Thank you.

32:00.200 --> 32:02.873
Why don't we dig up
those guns and go sell 'em?

32:02.960 --> 32:05.679
Not yet, McBain. Not yet.

32:05.760 --> 32:09.116
We gotta grow on each other
a little more, partner.

32:10.400 --> 32:14.837
But I got one rule.
Never go to bed without making a profit.

32:15.920 --> 32:18.912
Did you give any thought
to that game back there?

32:20.400 --> 32:22.391
Let's give it a try.

32:27.120 --> 32:29.111
All right, men. Ante up, please.

32:30.880 --> 32:32.757
Room for two more?

32:32.840 --> 32:35.912
For more men and more money
if you don't mind being separated.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.309
I might as well warn you boys I'm a bad loser.

32:38.400 --> 32:40.675
I'm Ed McBain.

32:43.320 --> 32:44.958
- All right.
- Bill Kane.

32:45.040 --> 32:47.474
- My name's Garth.
- And my name's Tully Crow.

32:47.560 --> 32:50.757
And the name of the game is five-card stud.
Cough up the dues.

32:50.840 --> 32:53.070
Cut the cards if you're a traveller.

32:54.800 --> 32:56.791
Good luck to everybody.

32:59.360 --> 33:01.351
See you.

33:02.560 --> 33:06.269
- Three queens.
- You're sure lucky tonight, brother.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.595
You can't keep from winning tonight,
can you, partner?

33:12.680 --> 33:14.830
They've been runnin' pretty good.

33:14.920 --> 33:20.631
But not for me. Seems least a man can do
is let his partner win one now and then.

33:21.200 --> 33:24.192
- You couldn't win one if he let you.
- How is that?

33:24.920 --> 33:27.798
- You play too wild, mister.
- Man's right.

33:27.880 --> 33:32.317
- Luck ain't got a thing to do with cards.
- Not the way those cards was being dealt.

33:32.400 --> 33:35.198
Now, you better do
a little beggin' your pardon.

33:35.280 --> 33:38.750
What for? I don't mind losin'.
I just like to have a run for my money.

33:38.840 --> 33:41.798
- I'll give you your money back.
- Don't do me no favours.

33:41.880 --> 33:44.519
Just try dealin' a hand
straight next time around.

33:44.600 --> 33:48.593
- No call for that kind of talk, mister.
- You better watch your step, brother.

33:48.680 --> 33:50.955
Let's remember we're gentlemen.

33:51.040 --> 33:54.430
Forget it. He's just spittin' out words
to see where they splatter.

33:54.520 --> 33:57.717
You think I miss much?
You think I didn't see that look you passed

33:57.800 --> 34:02.828
to this cold-footed, slippery-fingered
gentleman on my right when you sat down?

34:02.920 --> 34:05.832
How many partners
you got in this game, partner?

34:05.920 --> 34:07.717
That's whisky talking, Crow.

34:07.800 --> 34:10.678
You know better than that.
Whisky don't muddle me none.

34:10.760 --> 34:15.311
And you better remember that next time
you run your thumb over them cards.

34:16.560 --> 34:20.030
There ain't gonna be no next time.
I'm gettin' out.

34:20.120 --> 34:24.670
- Give the change to the swabber.
- No, you ain't out. Not till I say so.

34:25.159 --> 34:27.310
Time we both quit, Crow.

34:27.400 --> 34:30.630
You don't like losing to me
and I don't like winning from you.

34:30.960 --> 34:34.235
Nobody's dropping out
till I get my money back.

34:34.320 --> 34:36.231
Mind a suggestion, friend?

34:36.320 --> 34:39.277
The trouble is you don't
enjoy the game for its own reward.

34:39.360 --> 34:41.396
Stimulation, relaxation,

34:41.480 --> 34:44.755
pleasant association
and the interesting conversation.

34:44.840 --> 34:46.909
Shut your mouth.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.987
Keep your seat. Don't cut in on this.

34:52.600 --> 34:55.194
Crow, this isn't gonna get
any better picking at it.

34:55.280 --> 34:57.316
I don't want any quarrel with you.

34:57.400 --> 34:59.709
We got a deal. That's more important.

34:59.800 --> 35:02.473
And, like I said,
I'll give you your money back.

35:02.560 --> 35:05.836
- But I'm walking out.
- You're gonna sit down.

35:05.920 --> 35:07.831
You're gonna play poker.

35:07.920 --> 35:11.754
It might take me longer
to get it back that way, but you got time.

35:11.840 --> 35:13.831
You took it quick enough.

35:16.680 --> 35:18.910
We'll talk about that in the morning.

35:19.000 --> 35:22.709
McBain, you try walkin' out on me now
and see how far you get -

35:22.800 --> 35:24.597
deal or no deal.

35:26.920 --> 35:29.832
You need me as much as I need you, Crow.

35:29.920 --> 35:31.956
Give that some thought.

35:46.360 --> 35:48.396
Self-defence, McBain.

35:48.480 --> 35:51.392
My name ain't McBain,
and you're under arrest.

35:52.880 --> 35:55.678
Thanks for not giving me away, but...

35:55.760 --> 35:58.320
he's dead now. It doesn't matter.

35:58.400 --> 35:59.617
How do you know you killed him?

35:59.697 --> 36:02.796
There wasn't time not to. On your feet!

36:03.480 --> 36:05.471
Give me that peashooter.

36:30.880 --> 36:32.711
Unlock 'em.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.594
I know you know how to handle one of these.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.991
Dig.

36:48.880 --> 36:51.348
- Dig what?
- A hole.

36:53.280 --> 36:56.272
Don't worry. It's for takin' somethin' out.

37:20.920 --> 37:23.718
You haven't asked
why I use the name McBain.

37:25.080 --> 37:29.517
Well, you're still a ranger,
so you were working undercover.

37:29.600 --> 37:34.628
Maybe you think you'd have been better off
if you'd have just told Crow who I was.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.597
Maybe.

37:36.680 --> 37:39.990
Be glad you didn't.
Then I'd have killed you both.

37:40.080 --> 37:42.469
Well, he made that easier than I would.

37:43.400 --> 37:46.631
Yeah. He was fast.

37:46.720 --> 37:48.711
Fairly.

37:49.640 --> 37:51.835
Fill that up again.

37:51.920 --> 37:53.319
What for?

37:53.400 --> 37:57.473
You wouldn't want someone to fall in there
and break their neck, would ya?

37:57.560 --> 37:59.551
Fill it up.

38:11.360 --> 38:15.148
# Oh, the moon shines tonight
on pretty Red Wing

38:15.240 --> 38:17.356
# On pretty Red Wing

38:17.440 --> 38:19.431
<i>(hums tune)</i>

38:20.520 --> 38:22.829
Well, it's not the moon shinin' out here.

38:22.920 --> 38:26.435
It's the sun and it's hot. It's real hot.

38:26.520 --> 38:29.273
Not back here. It's real cool.

38:29.360 --> 38:32.158
Too bad there's not room for both of us.

38:33.280 --> 38:36.716
If you'll permit me a statement.
This is very uncivilised.

38:37.200 --> 38:42.558
Well, now, Monsewer, that's something
nobody ever accused me of - being civilised.

38:42.640 --> 38:45.359
Especially people
who bend shovels over my head.

38:45.440 --> 38:47.715
I presume you won't take my word of honour

38:47.800 --> 38:50.712
that I would behave
if you permit me back in the wagon.

38:50.800 --> 38:52.518
You presume right.

38:52.600 --> 38:56.229
# Oh, the moon shines tonight
on pretty Red Wing

38:56.320 --> 38:58.197
# On pretty Red Wing

38:58.280 --> 39:00.271
# Da da da-da da

39:10.320 --> 39:13.869
McLain! Have the men roll up
their blankets and saddle up.

39:13.960 --> 39:16.428
We move out in ten minutes.

39:31.840 --> 39:34.149
- Hello, Jake!
- Hello, Bender.

39:37.520 --> 39:38.794
Whoa!

39:40.720 --> 39:42.836
- Hi, Tobe.
- Captain Jake.

39:42.920 --> 39:45.275
- Carson.
- Hi, Jake.

39:52.200 --> 39:56.113
- What's all the ruckus about?
- About 200 Comanches on the Upper Brazos.

39:56.280 --> 39:57.599
Ow!

39:57.680 --> 40:00.240
Major Henry has a patrol out
warning the ranchers.

40:00.320 --> 40:02.880
- That thing hasn't healed up yet?
- Partly.

40:02.960 --> 40:05.269
- It'll be all right.
- You can take it.

40:05.960 --> 40:07.951
Who's that?

40:10.040 --> 40:13.715
Monsewer, you haven't got
the sense of ajack rabbit.

40:13.800 --> 40:18.749
Letting hot horses drink. Keep 'em away
from the water till they've cooled out.

40:18.840 --> 40:22.276
- Don't you know anything about horses?
- I know enough about horses.

40:22.360 --> 40:25.716
When I want one I call a groom.
When I'm done, I call a groom to take him

40:25.800 --> 40:27.870
and the groom says "Yes, sir, Mr Regret".

40:27.960 --> 40:33.159
- That's all I wanna know about horses.
- You better cool off a little yourself.

40:33.240 --> 40:36.915
I'm gonna let you founder
if you want to, but not the horses.

40:37.760 --> 40:39.591
Watch him.

40:39.680 --> 40:41.716
- Hello, Bub.
- Hi, Mr Jake.

40:43.360 --> 40:44.918
- Major.
- Hello, Jake.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.310
I'm surprised to see you.
Who's your prisoner?

40:48.400 --> 40:51.312
That's the fella that escaped.
The $300-suit fella.

40:51.400 --> 40:55.279
- Uh-huh. How did you wind up with him?
- It's a long story, Major.

40:55.360 --> 40:58.352
- Can we get in the shade?
- I don't know why not.

41:06.240 --> 41:09.152
- Here's some fresh water for you.
- Oh, thanks.

41:13.280 --> 41:15.271
That's sure some fancy shirt.

41:16.840 --> 41:20.992
My ma's got one like that.
I never seen none on no man before.

41:21.960 --> 41:23.871
Is this a ranger station?

41:23.960 --> 41:27.748
You're sure ignorant! Ain't you
never seen a grain ranch before?

41:27.840 --> 41:31.230
- What are the rangers doing here?
- Chasing Comanches.

41:31.320 --> 41:34.392
- Comanches? Indians?
- Sure. The worst kind.

41:34.480 --> 41:38.029
Everybody knows that.
Everybody but you, seems like.

41:45.720 --> 41:48.075
- How about Tobe?
- I'm leaving him with you.

41:48.160 --> 41:50.071
I want him to rest his leg.

41:50.160 --> 41:52.116
Say, Jake, uh...

41:52.200 --> 41:56.318
Think you can talk Schofield into
moving into town till this trouble's over?

41:56.400 --> 41:59.437
- I'll do the best I can, Major.
- Thanks, Jake.

41:59.520 --> 42:01.511
All right. Move out!

42:10.560 --> 42:13.313
- Have you watered the horses yet?
- You told me not to.

42:13.400 --> 42:15.391
But they've cooled out now.

42:16.400 --> 42:17.549
Here.

42:17.640 --> 42:21.519
Then I gotta feed you.
Miss Schofield's cooking's too good for you.

42:21.600 --> 42:24.239
Miss Schofield's busy.
Starting to have a baby.

42:24.320 --> 42:27.153
- Is that right?
- He'll have to eat Schofield's cooking.

42:27.240 --> 42:29.879
- Hiya, Jake.
- Hello, Lem.

42:30.640 --> 42:33.473
- Got a little grain for your team.
- Good. Feed 'em.

42:33.560 --> 42:36.711
- I hear your missis is gonna have a baby.
- Pretty soon, I guess.

42:36.800 --> 42:40.395
Great. With things the way they are,
don't you think it'd be a good idea

42:40.480 --> 42:43.358
to get Martha out of here
till the Indian trouble's over?

42:43.440 --> 42:48.355
I'm going to but Martha's having the baby.
I wanted to get in as much grain as I could.

42:48.440 --> 42:51.000
I've just been putting it off.

42:51.080 --> 42:54.231
I got another problem.
I gotta feed this prisoner.

42:54.320 --> 42:58.359
Come here. I don't want you cuffed to me
and I don't wanna lose you.

42:59.680 --> 43:03.992
I don't think you'll be too spry
with this tucked under your arm.

43:04.080 --> 43:06.071
It should hold him.

43:08.280 --> 43:10.077
Let's get to the victuals.

43:10.160 --> 43:12.276
Jim! Feed these horses, will you?

43:13.640 --> 43:15.631
Martha! We've got company.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.912
- Hello there, big Jake.
- Hello, Martha.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.468
Sorry to be using your house
at a time like this.

43:21.560 --> 43:23.915
There's no one I'd rather have than you, Jake.

43:24.000 --> 43:27.788
- Back again, Miss Schofield.
- You're always welcome, Tobe.

43:29.760 --> 43:31.910
Jake.

43:32.000 --> 43:36.399
That young fella with you.
What's that he's carrying under his arm?

43:36.480 --> 43:39.631
Well, that's an anvil, Martha.
He's carrying an anvil.

43:40.080 --> 43:42.230
Why ever would he wanna do that?

43:42.320 --> 43:44.959
He's become attached to it, sort of.

43:46.640 --> 43:49.393
Now, you get back to resting.
We'll make out.

43:50.280 --> 43:52.271
Jake, it's so good to see you.

43:53.000 --> 43:56.231
Pa! You make sure
Jake eats off the good china -

43:56.320 --> 43:58.914
the set him and Bess
give us for our anniversary.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.309
I will, Ma.

44:01.400 --> 44:05.552
Seems like just the other day
that you and Bess was sitting here, eating.

44:05.640 --> 44:09.553
Time flies. How long is it
since she's been gone, Jake?

44:09.640 --> 44:11.915
About two years, ain't it?

44:13.080 --> 44:15.150
Two years,

44:15.240 --> 44:17.913
two months, 13 days.

44:25.800 --> 44:28.917
- You make yourself at home, young man.
- Thank you.

44:33.040 --> 44:35.270
Set that anvil up here, Monsewer.

44:50.440 --> 44:51.429
<i>(screams)</i>

44:56.520 --> 44:58.158
Comanches!

44:58.240 --> 45:00.196
- You got any rifles?
- In the corner.

45:14.840 --> 45:17.195
Pretty good shooting for a handgun.

45:27.680 --> 45:30.274
White men riding with Indians.
Comancheros.

45:30.360 --> 45:32.920
That's what I've been
trying to tell Major Henry.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.993
Better get your head down, Jake,
or you'll never tell him again.

46:10.320 --> 46:13.869
- Looks like they're pulling out.
- Don't bet on it.

46:17.480 --> 46:20.313
- How are you fixed for ammunition?
- I could use some.

46:20.400 --> 46:23.039
- I need some.
- I'll see what I can do.

46:27.600 --> 46:30.114
- Any more rifle shells?
- Top drawer, highboy.

46:30.200 --> 46:31.758
Bub, keep that fire going!

46:34.240 --> 46:36.231
Look out! They're regroupin'.

46:36.320 --> 46:38.311
<i>(whooping)</i>

46:55.520 --> 46:58.080
Looks like you lost him again, Jake.

46:58.160 --> 47:00.993
<i>(Tobe) Hold it.
You may need that ammunition.</i>

48:50.480 --> 48:53.153
Kind of surprised to see you back.

48:56.320 --> 48:58.356
I'm kind of surprised I came back.

48:58.880 --> 49:01.678
Looks like this little fracas is about over.

49:02.360 --> 49:04.351
I'll take that gun now.

49:24.320 --> 49:26.311
He didn't make it.

49:28.560 --> 49:31.120
Jake.

49:31.200 --> 49:34.954
I'm gonna take the responsibility
and move all of these settlers out.

49:35.040 --> 49:37.634
Everybody west of the Llano River.

49:37.720 --> 49:40.996
I figure you'll wanna see that
Melinda and her daughter get out.

49:41.080 --> 49:44.629
I planned to do that
when I saw the size of this war party.

49:44.720 --> 49:47.792
- Major, there's one other thing.
- Yeah?

49:47.880 --> 49:49.916
Regret.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.549
That's too bad. We owe him something.

49:53.640 --> 49:55.631
But orders are orders.

49:56.480 --> 49:59.040
I thought somebody
could talk to Judge Breen.

49:59.120 --> 50:03.398
- If there's a way, the judge'll know it.
- It'd help if you'd talk to him.

50:03.480 --> 50:08.793
He doesn't take too kindly to me since I drew
those fourjacks against his full house.

50:08.880 --> 50:10.871
He just never was a good loser.

50:12.240 --> 50:16.233
I'll be in Llano with the patrol
three days from now, and I'll see you there.

50:16.320 --> 50:19.756
Take a couple of horses
and I'll bring your wagon.

50:20.240 --> 50:23.550
<i>- It's a boy, gentlemen! A boy!
- (Bub) Captain Jake!</i>

50:23.640 --> 50:26.154
New blood in the Schofield family!

50:26.240 --> 50:29.789
He's as red as a lobster
and fightin' mad, but he's a dandy.

50:33.000 --> 50:37.152
We're gonna name him after you, Jake.
Cutter we'll call him. Cutter Schofield.

50:37.240 --> 50:42.917
I appreciate the honour, but I think we ought
to name him Regret after Monsewer here.

50:43.560 --> 50:48.190
If it wasn't for the Monsewer, our scalps'd
be dangling from some Comanche tepee

50:48.280 --> 50:50.999
and this little tad'd
never grow up to lie about Texas.

50:51.080 --> 50:54.629
Regret Schofield. Sounds nice.
May grow up to be president.

50:54.720 --> 50:57.837
- You can take big odds against that.
- It's all settled.

50:57.920 --> 50:59.956
Son, take Regret in to your mother.

51:00.040 --> 51:02.838
Gentlemen, there's ajug in the wellhouse!

51:11.840 --> 51:15.355
After what happened back at Schofield's,
you making me a godfather,

51:15.440 --> 51:18.318
aren't you carrying this thing a little too far?

51:18.400 --> 51:22.518
I feel bad about it, Monsewer.
If it was up to me, it'd be different.

51:22.600 --> 51:26.559
Who else is it up to?
There's just you and I.

51:26.640 --> 51:30.030
I've thought on it a lot.
Gave myself a lot of argument.

51:30.120 --> 51:32.315
But I just can't do it.

51:32.400 --> 51:35.153
"Let him make a run for it" I say to myself.

51:35.240 --> 51:39.677
- Then what would you say?
- I'd say to myself "You can't let him run".

51:39.760 --> 51:42.354
"You swore an oath
when they put that badge on you".

51:42.440 --> 51:45.273
- That's important to you?
- I said I swore an oath.

51:45.360 --> 51:50.309
- Words.
- Monsewer, words are what men live by.

51:50.400 --> 51:52.391
Words they say and mean.

51:52.480 --> 51:56.075
You must have had
a real careless upbringing.

51:56.160 --> 51:58.435
However...

51:58.520 --> 52:00.750
Now, please don't get any ideas.

52:00.840 --> 52:04.355
Cos it'd break my heart
did I have to put a bullet in your back.

52:04.440 --> 52:06.431
It'd make me sad also.

52:07.920 --> 52:11.310
You've been doing
a lot of complaining about my cooking.

52:11.400 --> 52:13.152
Get ready for the best meal in Texas.

52:33.240 --> 52:35.674
Mommy! Mommy!

52:35.760 --> 52:38.991
Look who's here. Uncle Jake.

52:46.120 --> 52:49.237
- Uncle Jake!
- How are you, honey?

52:49.320 --> 52:51.709
- Where's your mommy?
- There.

52:54.640 --> 52:58.076
Oh, this is Monsewer Paul Regret, Bessie.

52:58.920 --> 53:01.673
- How you doin'?
- Hi, Monsewer.

53:11.640 --> 53:14.200
- Hello, Jake.
- Hello, Melinda.

53:15.160 --> 53:19.517
I, uh... see that the fence
has broken down again.

53:20.080 --> 53:22.878
It only lasts from
one of your visits to the next.

53:22.960 --> 53:24.313
Well, I, uh...

53:24.400 --> 53:27.870
Oh, this is Monsewer Paul Regret.

53:28.400 --> 53:29.992
- How do you do?
- Mrs Marshall.

53:30.080 --> 53:33.436
It's a pleasure to meet any friend of Jake's.

53:33.520 --> 53:35.397
Well, thank you, ma'am.

53:35.480 --> 53:39.155
My friend Jake here was telling me
you're the best cook in Texas.

53:39.240 --> 53:42.152
Isn't this a wonderful surprise, Mommy?

53:42.400 --> 53:44.709
And I've got a surprise for you, Bessie.

53:44.800 --> 53:48.952
You're going to pack your things
and go into town with Uncle Jake.

53:49.040 --> 53:52.555
There may be some visitors here
that aren't as welcome as us.

53:52.640 --> 53:54.915
- We'll be ready.
- Oh, uh...

53:55.000 --> 53:59.039
Not until my friend here
has tasted some real Texas cooking.

54:00.240 --> 54:02.470
I hope I can live up to your bragging.

54:10.120 --> 54:13.908
# Frère Jacques, frère Jacques

54:14.000 --> 54:16.070
# Dormez-vous?

54:16.160 --> 54:17.752
# Dormez-vous?

54:18.040 --> 54:20.110
# Sonnez les matines

54:20.200 --> 54:22.111
# Sonnez les matines

54:22.200 --> 54:23.952
# Ding dang dong

54:24.040 --> 54:26.190
# Ding dang dong

54:26.920 --> 54:31.232
Listen, Mommy. We're singing in French.

54:33.840 --> 54:36.673
Go get Mother the silver teapot
that Uncle Jake gave us.

54:36.760 --> 54:38.796
All right, Mommy.

54:38.880 --> 54:41.348
# Frère Jacques...

54:41.440 --> 54:44.955
- Bessie sings well.
- She gets that from her father, I guess.

54:45.040 --> 54:47.031
He had a fine voice.

54:48.240 --> 54:51.118
You said your husband was dead four years.
Was it Indians?

54:51.200 --> 54:54.510
No. He was killed. The battle of San Jacinto.

54:55.160 --> 54:57.594
When Texas won its independence?

54:57.680 --> 55:01.229
The same shell burst hit my husband
and Jake and Sam Houston.

55:01.320 --> 55:04.312
- They were all standing together.
- President Sam Houston?

55:04.400 --> 55:08.313
No, he wasn't president then.
That was before we were a republic.

55:08.400 --> 55:10.914
Then Jake brought my husband's body home.

55:11.000 --> 55:14.595
He made us move away
from the frontier and take this place.

55:15.640 --> 55:18.313
Your Bessie's named after Jake's wife.

55:18.400 --> 55:22.996
We grew up together. Everybody was
so surprised when she married Jake.

55:23.080 --> 55:28.632
They were so different. He's so big
and tough - at least on the outside.

55:28.720 --> 55:31.314
And she was so tiny and so gentle.

55:32.040 --> 55:34.395
But one never knows about those things.

55:34.480 --> 55:36.789
They got along just fine.

55:36.880 --> 55:39.713
Well, I better go inspect Bessie's progress.

55:47.760 --> 55:50.479
- Captain Jake?
- Yeah?

55:50.560 --> 55:54.553
Can you give me one good reason
why you don't marry that woman?

55:54.640 --> 55:57.029
Why don't you mind your own business?

56:00.000 --> 56:04.596
I haven't got one good reason...
that'd make sense to you.

56:04.680 --> 56:06.716
Every time I quit to get married,

56:06.800 --> 56:11.715
that miserable, low-down silver-tongued
Houston starts bending my ear

56:11.800 --> 56:15.270
about how Texas needs
every man and every gun,

56:15.360 --> 56:18.670
what with this Comanche
and renegade trouble.

56:18.760 --> 56:22.389
But duty and patriotism
doesn't make sense to you.

56:22.480 --> 56:25.995
- You think I'm simple-minded.
- Yes, I do think you're simple-minded.

56:26.080 --> 56:30.278
Well, don't make a point of saying that
too often. And once more'll be too often.

56:30.360 --> 56:32.396
- But I envy you.
- You what?

56:32.480 --> 56:36.792
Two women in one man's lifetime.
Yeah, I really do envy you.

56:39.120 --> 56:41.793
I guess you're right. I'm God-given lucky.

56:42.760 --> 56:44.716
It really happened to me.

56:44.800 --> 56:47.314
At least I think it really happened to me.

56:48.160 --> 56:52.073
I suppose I can't be too sure about it
cos I just met the girl.

56:52.160 --> 56:54.993
Well, it doesn't go by the calendar.

56:55.080 --> 56:58.277
It either is or it isn't.
Time doesn't have much to do with it.

56:58.360 --> 57:00.920
Yeah? Then it happened to me.

57:01.760 --> 57:05.469
- Why'd you let her get away?
- Because a big ugly character with a star

57:05.560 --> 57:08.154
snapped some handcuffs on me
and dragged me away.

57:08.240 --> 57:10.231
- The woman at the boat?
- Yeah.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.798
Well, I'm sorry, Monsewer. Real sorry.

57:15.080 --> 57:16.991
Captain Jake, I believe you.

57:17.080 --> 57:21.119
I actually believe that
you're really sincerely sorry.

57:21.200 --> 57:23.236
You've got a lot of Cupid in you

57:23.320 --> 57:26.471
but, I must admit,
Cupid picked a strange place to hide.

57:27.520 --> 57:31.433
Monsewer, you may not
live long enough to hang.

57:37.320 --> 57:39.311
Your brougham awaits.

57:40.840 --> 57:43.559
You go down and take care of the horses.

57:43.640 --> 57:45.631
Remember I'm watching.

57:54.080 --> 57:56.071
Ya!

58:10.360 --> 58:13.272
- Take care of the team, will ya, Lem?
- Yes, sir.

58:14.200 --> 58:15.633
Linda, this is a surprise.

58:15.720 --> 58:17.711
- Hello, Jake.
- Hello, Mrs Breen.

58:17.800 --> 58:21.588
- Looks like we'll be on your hands awhile.
- My, Bessie, how you have grown.

58:21.680 --> 58:24.478
- Where's the judge?
- In his office with some rangers.

58:24.560 --> 58:28.917
You better go in and get located.
We'll take care of this stuff later.

58:35.760 --> 58:38.149
Think this friend of yours
will be of much help?

58:38.240 --> 58:40.515
I wouldn't hold out
too much hope, Monsewer.

58:40.600 --> 58:44.878
My conscience'll be clear. I'll have done
all I could to keep you from gettin' hung.

58:44.960 --> 58:46.951
Oh, great. As I drop through the trap,

58:47.040 --> 58:50.476
my last thought'll be
"Well, big Jake did all he could".

58:53.760 --> 58:55.990
- Evenin', Jake.
- Judge.

58:56.080 --> 58:58.992
- This is Monsewer Paul Regret.
- How do you do?

58:59.080 --> 59:02.072
I'm Thadeus Jackson Breen.
Judge of the Texas Circuit Court.

59:02.160 --> 59:05.197
Most say - except them that's unfair-minded -

59:05.280 --> 59:08.556
that I'm the finest legal mind
in the entire Southwest.

59:08.640 --> 59:11.313
So you can have faith in your lawyer, son.

59:11.400 --> 59:14.233
- How much money you got?
- I don't have any.

59:14.320 --> 59:16.675
I begin to doubt your chances
against the law.

59:16.760 --> 59:19.149
Judge, you're doing this one for nothing.

59:19.240 --> 59:21.196
A workman is worthy of his hire.

59:21.280 --> 59:25.068
Sure, but suppose
these rangers start talking?

59:25.160 --> 59:29.597
About where a certain Judge was during a
ranger raid on a certain section of this town.

59:29.680 --> 59:33.639
- I was advising a client.
- And a pretty one she was, too, Judge.

59:33.720 --> 59:35.915
Seemed to be hangin'
on every word you said.

59:36.000 --> 59:40.630
See, Regret? We don't aim to just stand by
and see a fellow fighting man go down.

59:40.720 --> 59:43.234
Not without doing everything
that we can for him.

59:43.320 --> 59:47.438
- I don't understand.
- Major here's told me what your troubles are.

59:47.520 --> 59:51.798
I've thought it over in the light of my
40 years' experience in legal jurisprudence,

59:51.880 --> 59:54.235
and I've come to the positive conclusion

59:54.320 --> 59:57.869
that there ain't no way
to do this legal and honest.

59:57.960 --> 01:00:02.670
But, being good, sensible Texans,
we'll do her illegal and dishonest.

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:07.275
All the boys here in the room
have agreed to sign a paper I've prepared.

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:12.832
We're gonna all commit perjury. That's
legal language for a plain dumb-blasted lie.

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:18.197
Every man in this room's gonna swear
that you are a member of the Texas Rangers,

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.316
and have been for the last couple of years.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:23.631
Ain't no possible chance
you killed nobody in Louisiana.

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:27.554
Even Sam Houston himself wouldn't go up
against the word of a dozen rangers.

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:32.873
So, my boy, you are a member of the finest
underpaid organisation of men in the world.

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:38.556
- I don't know what to say.
- It's better than gettin' your neck stretched.

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:43.998
Well, thanks, men. It isn't only modesty
that makes me doubt I'll make a good ranger.

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:47.914
If I had some money,
I'd buy you something to celebrate with.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.673
Credit can be arranged.
My brother's saloon.

01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:52.318
<i>(all) Sure!</i>

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:54.711
Honest Ben Breen.

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:01.317
- Jake.
- Yeah?

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:04.392
- Tobe insists he's the third man.
- Oh.

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:08.029
- I was born and raised in the Bend Country.
- You're only 18 years old.

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:11.078
At 18, you were the only white man
south of the Pecos.

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:15.358
You told us till we were sick and tired of
hearing how you settled up Pecos Country.

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:19.353
We get to be bores as we get older. He'll do.

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:22.557
Now, Tobe, keep this wagon
in sight at all times.

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:25.518
- Let us know you're around.
- Don't worry.

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:30.998
I appreciate your volunteering, Regret.
Shows mighty fine spirit.

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.036
Good luck, men.

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:35.031
Did I volunteer for something?

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:38.715
You weren't handy. I knew
you'd want me to speak up for you.

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:43.075
Jake, I often wonder
what I ever did to deserve you.

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:44.149
Yee-ha!

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:53.438
I've often had every penny I own
on the turn of a card,

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:55.556
but never my life on a bundle of feathers.

01:01:55.640 --> 01:02:00.031
- You claim to be a gambler, don't you?
- This may cure me permanently.

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:16.229
Our guardian angel's still on the job.

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:41.393
Why the mystery with the frying pan, sir?
Why does he have to stay out of sight -

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:44.756
alone in the middle of 1,000 miles
of this ugly Texas country.

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:46.751
Don't you bet on that, gambler.

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:49.479
An Indian speciality is not being seen.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.631
Kick out the fire.

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.871
Cutter.

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:07.754
Put it away. They're tame.

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:11.230
- Tame? Tame Indians?
- Tame as dishwater.

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:17.511
<i>(speaking in native language)</i>

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:24.388
Well, I think we can afford one cigar.

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.711
Huh?

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:32.191
Oh, no. No whisky.

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:42.318
Tame Indians!
How do you tell the difference?

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:44.789
How do you know these
from the wild ones?

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:48.031
It's pretty hard to explain to a city fella.

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:51.078
But you take
like that snake there at your feet.

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.151
Don't shoot him, he's a gopher snake.

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:56.232
He's a friend. He eats mice and rats.

01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:58.311
We'll put him in the shade.

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:05.230
You see those darker markings?
Crosspatch overlay?

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:07.276
Makes him look like a rattler,

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:09.828
but you can see a thousand like that one.

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:14.232
And when you see your first rattlesnake,
you'll know the difference.

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:19.591
You still haven't told me how you tell
a Comanche from a tame Indian.

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:23.036
It's just like your first rattler.
One look and you'll know.

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:25.588
Come on. Get aboard.

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:34.471
Ya!

01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:49.634
<i>(Jake) Big country.</i>

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:52.234
<i>(Regret) Is this where
we'll find the Comancheros?</i>

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:57.155
You could hide the state of Louisiana here
and never find 'em if they didn't want you to.

01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:59.800
That's ourjob, findin' 'em.

01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:01.871
Or lettin' them find us.

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:20.354
Well, old Tobe is still on the job.

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:24.232
You know, I'm tryin'
to go along with your thinking.

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:29.189
But do you really believe that emblem will
convince a Comanche that we're gunrunners?

01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:31.669
- It had better.
- Yeah.

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:01.271
What's the matter?

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:04.191
I don't know.

01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:13.515
Comanches!

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:17.198
He's alone.

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:29.236
I hope that Tobe isn't taking a nap.

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:35.992
Well, we're about to find out
whether this passport'll work.

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:29.351
<i>Comancheros! Comancheros! Rifles!</i>

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:32.398
Comancheros!

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.389
I wish I had more practice at praying.

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:36.354
Comancheros! Comancheros!

01:09:04.439 --> 01:09:06.270
Over here, my friends! Whisky!

01:09:06.359 --> 01:09:08.828
Over here! Whisky! Here, whisky!

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:10.911
Over here, my friends.

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.071
Whisky!

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:45.510
You got a unique way
of paying off your help around here.

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:47.430
Who's ramrodding this outfit?

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:49.636
You'll find out. What do you want?

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:53.395
Monsewer, break open that false wagon bed.

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:59.398
My name's McBain.
I got guns and I wanna do business.

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:10.110
72 rifles... just like this one.

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:12.395
Pass 'em out. Let the boys handle 'em.

01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:22.671
Hold it!

01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:28.589
You must be the boss man.

01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:36.475
We brought 72 of these.

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:40.075
Just like this... except without firing pins.

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:43.232
Be useless to you
unless you do business with us.

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:45.914
Your presence here has made me very happy.

01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:48.671
<i>Bastinado!</i>

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:53.591
The pretty man from the boat.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.833
It's gonna get awful thirsty around here.

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:07.993
Better think of a new plan, Jake.
This one didn't work out so well.

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:11.390
The hell it didn't.
We found the hide-out, didn't we?

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:14.916
Yeah. I wonder if they know
how much trouble they're in.

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:25.720
Water.

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:28.234
Give me some water.

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:55.999
- Who ordered this?
- Amelung.

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:01.115
Cut them down and take care of them.

01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:07.148
- Cut them down and care for them.
- This was orders.

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:09.231
I said cut them down!

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:26.433
Oh! The top of my head
feels like an overdone pancake.

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:34.471
Say, you never did tell me
what happened to me after I was knocked out.

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:38.709
Well, a handsome young woman
on a horse came along.

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:43.799
She must have figured
it was Saturday night and we needed a bath.

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:52.429
Pretty boy, hurry it up. We're waitin' for you.

01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:54.795
I can do without the endearing words.

01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:57.314
- We going somewhere?
- Trial.

01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:01.154
- Trial?
- See whether you live or die. You'll die.

01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:04.391
I always figured to die. Question is, when?

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:06.870
Just hurry it up.

01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:09.675
You have broken a law of the society.

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:12.194
The penalty is death.

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:16.239
<i>- Does the society approve?
- (shouting)</i>

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:26.074
Don't kill them! I beg you! I beg you!

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:47.516
You may still wonder when, big man,
but now you know how.

01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:50.549
We go, my friends.

01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:55.350
Got another one of those fellas
uses that "my friend" stuff real careless.

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:00.559
<i>(angry shouting)</i>

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:03.393
Quiet! Quiet! Get back to your seats!

01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:05.471
Be civilised, my people.

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:08.919
We have guests today.
There's work to be done.

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:22.510
Gentlemen, you come among us uninvited.

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:24.591
The penalty for that is death.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.833
This society survives by its secrecy only.

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:32.118
You haven't violated that by entering here,
but you could if you left here.

01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:36.671
And it is our intention to see to it
that this secrecy is never violated.

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:42.517
Now, as to this story of yours that you will
bring us rifles without firing mechanisms,

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:44.989
take out our money
and return with other rifles,

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:48.868
and the firing mechanisms
of the first shipment...

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:54.877
I admit, it has the merit
of being well thought out.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.117
- You say your name is McBain?
- Ed McBain.

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:04.752
We know of a McBain. And it's told that this
McBain killed a man of ours in Sweetwater.

01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:08.435
You mean Crow?
Fella with the half-scalped topknot?

01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:12.035
- You killed him?
- Seemed like the thing to do at the moment.

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:18.596
It hardly surprises to me to hear
that Crow got himself killed.

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:21.672
If his occupation didn't, his manner would.

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:25.036
Your name is Paul Regret?

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:27.238
<i>(woman) That is his name.</i>

01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:30.114
His occupation is gambler.

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:32.919
- Pilar!
- We meet again.

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:36.557
I told you, sir.
That is the man she went back to search for.

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:39.393
Many wasted days trying to find him again.

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:43.553
He left New Orleans after killing a man.
The other man I don't know.

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:47.633
He killed Crow, which speaks well
for his speed with a gun.

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:50.996
It doesn't give him the right
to enter the place of our society

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:53.753
or to live, after having
discovered its whereabouts.

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:56.513
It is clear they know, so they die. It is a rule.

01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:59.512
A rule you made many years ago
and enforced many times.

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:01.591
It is of little concern to me what you do,

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:04.717
though I say it would be
intelligent to deal with them.

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:07.951
They offer us a continuing supply
of up-to-date weapons

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:11.635
instead of the few old-fashioned rifles
we get from the South.

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:16.430
<i>Do as you will. Just remember that you
expect me to take over responsibilities.</i>

01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:20.479
Therefore I presume
you would be willing to heed my opinion.

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:25.236
But if you prefer to placate
that bloodthirsty mongrel of yours,

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:27.595
then kill them.

01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:31.552
I tell you, she has
a personal interest in this man.

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:33.790
That is why she urges us to deal with him.

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:35.950
Amelung, you're a fool.

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:39.758
I've raised her never to let
emotion cloud ajudgment,

01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:42.195
which is what you're doing at this moment.

01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:46.353
Yourjealousy is apparent
and it's warping yourjudgment.

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:49.751
That is all.

01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:59.789
Bring those prisoners to my quarters!

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:08.351
- Esteban.
- Pilarcita.

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:11.557
Look over there. The taller of the two men.

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:13.915
Have you seen him before?

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:16.911
Galveston?

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.878
We were getting off the boat
in the grey dawn,

01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:22.349
and he was boarding just as it docked.

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:25.079
Oh, yes. Now I remember.

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:29.718
You know, McBain, that plan of yours
about the guns delights me.

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:34.237
It starts from the basic proposition
that nobody is trustworthy.

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:37.039
We couldn't double-cross
each other if we tried.

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:40.271
I can't wait to see the look on Amelung's face.

01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:46.515
Don't get the idea that my reproof of Amelung
indicates that I've adopted you two.

01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:48.909
I must put him in his place now and then.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.991
Help yourself to some wine.

01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:54.269
What do you think of our place, McBain?

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:58.436
It took a lot of lookin'
to find just such a layout.

01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:03.955
I stumbled on it some 30-odd years ago. I was
a different man physically, as you'll gather.

01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:08.318
At that time, there was a motley collection
of people dealing with the Indians.

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:10.834
I brought organisation to the business.

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:15.391
May I call your attention to the powder mill?
We make our own powder.

01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:20.679
The nitrates come from our own mines,
the saltpetre from deposits to the south.

01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:23.718
You're a travelled man, Mr Regret.
What do you think of it?

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:25.995
Seems to lack nothing.

01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:28.514
- You've done very well.
- I think so.

01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:33.151
Lest you think all of this talk is the idle
chatter of a broken chairbound man,

01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:35.549
I tell you this for a reason.

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:40.839
We have a society here, a society
that's different from anything visualised

01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:42.911
by people anywhere in the world.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.197
The rules of this society
are magnificently simple.

01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:49.911
Transgress and you die.

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:54.636
Long and painfully. Look over there.

01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:58.191
Not a pretty picture, is it?

01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:02.831
A Chinese philosopher once said
that a picture is worth a thousand words.

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:09.550
He stole. We, a society of thieves,
cannot tolerate stealing from each other.

01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:11.835
Take a long look over there and decide

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:16.516
whether or not you intend to faithfully
follow the rules of our society.

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:18.591
Gordo.

01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:22.471
I'll send for you in due time.

01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:34.632
I'll bet that old boy was a man to stand
aside from when he was young and limber.

01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:38.679
Right now, if he took a dislike to you,
you could get yourself killed in a hurry.

01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:40.876
What bothers me is finding that girl here.

01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:44.236
- Where do you know her from?
- I know her - or knew her briefly.

01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:46.550
Briefly? You must have made quite a dent.

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:49.313
She seems to favour us staying alive,
or at least you.

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:51.391
That was the girl on the boat.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.638
Oh.

01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:55.915
We got ourselves two problems.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.434
But the first one's to stay alive.

01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:02.069
Toward dark, Major Henry and the boys
are gonna come over that hill

01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:04.230
and we'd better have a place to fight from.

01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:07.835
- Fight with what?
- Naturally, when the war breaks out,

01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:11.629
we're gonnajump a couple of
these gentlemen and borrow their guns.

01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:14.473
Well, naturally. So natural that I overlooked it.

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:18.075
You take off the road in this direction,
and keep your eyes peeled.

01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:20.310
- I'll go the other way.
- All right.

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:08.076
Miss Graile?

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:11.835
This is the first chance I've had to thank you
for getting us out of the sun.

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:15.833
- You're welcome.
- In a way, I feel I don't owe you any thanks.

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:21.072
If it weren't for that good-looking fella,
by now I'd be approaching the well-done.

01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:25.358
- How long have you known Paul Regret?
- Off and on for quite a while.

01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:29.752
I'm beginning to doubt if it was wise to
save him. From now on, he'll be insufferable.

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:32.479
You're not exactly making yourself clear.

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:35.313
That fool Amelung had to shout
I went searching for Paul.

01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:39.916
Now he'll be so sure of me, he'll be
impossible to manage... Or so he thinks.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.276
But I shall find the opportunity
to teach him otherwise.

01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:44.349
<i>(chuckles)</i>

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:49.230
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just... glad
that I'm not your age or Regret's.

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:50.719
I went through all that.

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:55.476
Me and my wife used to fight like a couple
of wildcats with only one tree between us.

01:21:55.560 --> 01:22:01.157
But you soon find out that it doesn't make
a tinker's damn who's got the upper hand.

01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:05.995
A few years roll by and you kinda settle down
to being at ease with each other.

01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:08.435
Then life gets worth living.

01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:11.318
In every relationship between human beings,

01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:15.075
one is dominant and one is subservient.

01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:18.277
The way you make it sound,
life'd be one long war.

01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:22.592
- Isn't it?
- Missy, you got a lot of surprise coming.

01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:25.069
Some good, some bad.

01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:35.110
Mr McBain!

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:41.632
Speaking of surprises,
Mr McBain, there's something...

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:42.709
<i>(screaming)</i>

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:44.358
<i>(gunshots)</i>

01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:06.711
<i>(speaks in native language)</i>

01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:11.354
- Is that Chief Iron Shirt?
- Yes.

01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:15.433
Now we'll have a celebration.
All of his visits call for one.

01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:17.636
First time I've ever seen him in the flesh.

01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:22.919
Mr McBain, I might enjoy prolonging
this conversation with you but for one thing.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.356
Your name. Naturally, it's not McBain.

01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:28.715
<i>Well, a man in my business
uses many names;</i>

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:32.679
- Just what is your business?
- At the moment, I'm a gunrunner.

01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:36.514
Three weeks ago, as I was getting off
the boat in Galveston, you went aboard.

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:39.194
You wore a Texas Rangers star on your shirt.

01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:44.509
You're poised, Mr, uh...
whatever your name is.

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:47.239
What for? Flight?

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:49.038
Where could you go?

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:53.079
To fight? You are unarmed
and there are hundreds of us.

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:56.914
You're the coolest character I ever met.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.274
<i>(gunshots continue)</i>

01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:00.430
What happens now?

01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:02.511
I don't know.

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:16.951
Hello, Pilar.

01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:25.070
Women. How can you figure 'em?
She's been chasin' me for three weeks.

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:28.869
- Saves my life and now she won't talk to me.
- Saved my life, too.

01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:33.909
I don't think you better put that girl in a class
with any of the other girls you've known.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.195
She'll never act the way you figure.

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:40.353
As a matter of fact, I wish I knew how she
was gonna act about a certain little matter.

01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:42.874
She knows I'm a ranger.

01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:45.076
Told me so in no uncertain terms.

01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:47.754
We better get to that corral
and get us some horses.

01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:50.149
Try to make it to the top?
What chance'd we have?

01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:52.708
- Not much...
- No chance at all.

01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:57.271
- We can jump those Comancheros...
- Monsewer, you've changed.

01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:00.272
I thought you were the fella
that took care of number one.

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:02.476
Well, I've gotten used to you.

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:05.199
We'll just sit tight. The girl's got a problem.

01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:09.319
She points her finger at me
and hollers "Ranger", your head goes too.

01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:12.073
She seems to put quite a value on you.

01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:16.233
So we'll just hold on
for a few hours and give Tobe a chance.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:35.836
If they keep this up, they'll save the rangers
the trouble. Probably kill themselves all off.

01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:10.551
Paul.

01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:15.950
Paul, there's some...

01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:21.793
I've been wanting to do that for a long time.

01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:28.876
Paul, there's something I've got to tell you.

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:32.391
Pilar.

01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:35.951
I hope I'm not intruding.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.355
Mr McBain!

01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:42.193
I'd like to invite you
to join us for dinner tonight.

01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:47.513
I suppose that good manners force me
to include your romantically inclined friend.

01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:53.433
You'll find she has a mind of her own.

01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:55.511
Gordo.

01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:57.911
After sundown on the terrace.

01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:07.675
It looks like
the condemned men'll eat a hearty dinner.

01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:28.911
Let's go. Move out!

01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:02.511
<i>Gracias, señor.</i>

01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:10.357
Esteban! 300 more for him.

01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:15.319
Oh, gentlemen. If you'll excuse me
for about ten minutes. Business.

01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:17.789
Gordo, give them some refreshments.

01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:30.349
- Don't mind me.
- I'm glad you're here.

01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:33.830
I've been trying to tell you all day.
Your friend has one chance.

01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:37.037
A horse and provisions for you
will be waiting by the stairs.

01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:39.111
You can escape sometime tonight.

01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:42.272
- Will there be a gun in the saddle?
- Don't make conditions.

01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:44.191
How naive do you think we are?

01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:47.397
If he's followed,
he'll never make it to the top of the rim.

01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:49.471
- You refuse to accept my plan?
- Well...

01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:54.759
Shut up. Keep losing your patience
and then we'll find out what happens next.

01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:58.037
All right. I've done all I can.
You're on your own.

01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:11.231
<i>So. Unless I let your man kill him,
and stay here with you like a maquereau...</i>

01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:14.153
<i>- That's French...
- I know what it means, mon cher ami.</i>

01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:16.674
It's pretty obvious that you feel I'm unique.

01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:19.718
Oh, your modesty
is your most appealing quality.

01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:23.793
You backtracked trying to find me again.
And I feel the same way about you.

01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:28.396
We can't stay here together. You can't stay
in Texas, being wanted by the authorities.

01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:32.632
So we'll go somewhere else.
Anywhere else. Just you and me.

01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:34.597
How do I know you're not lying?

01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:38.468
You don't. There's no way
you can prove that I'm not lying.

01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:41.438
Every time a man and a woman
talk like this to each other,

01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:45.035
neither can prove to themselves
that they aren't being lied to.

01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:48.590
Pilar, what all this adds up to
is that I love you.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.833
And there's no way
you can tell whether I'm not lying.

01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:55.911
You believe or don't believe.

01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:13.391
Good evening, friend.

01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:29.591
Excuse me, Pilarcita.

01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:34.669
I've been told to have the wagon brought here
at dawn so that these two men may leave.

01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:37.194
But I'll bring it myself so there's no mistakes.

01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:39.271
Thank you, Esteban.

01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:50.075
<i>- Viejo?
- Yeah?</i>

01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:52.151
How about a light?

01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:54.711
<i>El grande mucho.</i>

01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:03.000
<i>- Muchísimas gracias.
- De nada.</i>

01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:09.391
<i>(speaks in native language)</i>

01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:24.837
You must give me your opinion
about the wine we're having.

01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:27.309
Our own grapes, you know.

01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:31.996
Oh, it would be a shame to have our guest
of honour drown in a plate of soup.

01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:38.550
Gentlemen, you must forgive the noble chief.
His semi-annual visits are a great occasion.

01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:40.756
- Papa.
- Yes?

01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:43.070
I'm leaving here for ever.

01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:45.355
I'm going away with Paul.

01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:48.352
This is no life for me
and this is no place for you.

01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:52.678
How frail is human judgment,
particularly the female's.

01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:57.880
It would be common sense to pick
the big ugly one and not the handsome one.

01:31:57.960 --> 01:32:00.918
He has definite indications
of character in his face.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.834
That big nose that someone broke
at one time, the scars above the eyebrows

01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:09.630
all show that at one time he has enforced,
or tried to enforce, his will upon others.

01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:12.553
Obviously a man of great determination.

01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:17.592
Thank you, Mr Graile. Compliments are
always welcome, no matter what the source.

01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:20.035
- A wonderful man!
- Papa, stop this!

01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:23.795
I'm in no mood.
I'm leaving and I wish you would leave, too.

01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:27.395
Iron Shirt can get you to the south
and from there, the world is wide.

01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:29.152
You can go where you choose.

01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:32.550
Why should I die in a place
other than the one I made for myself?

01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:36.189
- Why are you so anxious that I leave?
- This place is no longer safe.

01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:38.510
The authorities know its location.

01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:46.712
I'm afraid the noble chief may not rejoin us.

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:50.918
He inherited that armour from his grandfather
who fought the Conquistadores.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:54.879
I leap to the conclusion
that you are the authorities.

01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:59.158
I was afraid that the little lady's remark
would spill the beans.

01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:03.079
Now, Papa, in a very short time,

01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:06.709
a company of rangers
is gonna come boiling in here,

01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:09.439
and you'll hurry your end if you don't behave.

01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:13.308
Mr McBain, you're introducing
a discordant note here.

01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:27.632
He followed these two.
They signalled back and forth.

01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:32.271
Ah, what a shame.
It looks like company's not coming.

01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:36.152
Mr McBain, would you mind
handing over your pistol?

01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:37.958
Monsewer...

01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:39.996
charge.

01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:48.831
<i>(mumbles drunkenly)</i>

01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:00.675
What's your story? Saving bullets?

01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:03.350
Couldn't afford the sound of a shot.

01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:07.752
- You looked to be doing all right.
- For a while there, it was even money.

01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:13.555
- Now, Papa...
- Not quite, Mr McBain.

01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:15.631
Gordo!

01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:32.511
Well, get him off me!

01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:35.351
- Is that a closet?
- Yes.

01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:40.591
Keep a lookout on the terrace.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:53.711
My daughter forgets that in the eyes of Texas
justice, she may not be an innocent party.

01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:57.156
You know the oath you put so much faith in,
the words men live by?

01:34:57.240 --> 01:35:01.472
Make up your mind to this. When we get over
the top o' the rim, we're partin' company.

01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:04.757
You can take him north,
but she and I are goin' south.

01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:06.398
- Mexico?
- For a start.

01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:10.519
There's 1,000 miles of Indian territory.
Apache and Yaqui.

01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:12.477
I figure she's worth it.

01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:14.949
You made it, Monsewer! That's love.

01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:18.348
<i>(Graile) You're all fools.</i>

01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:22.951
<i>(Jake) But it's fun sometimes,
particularly when you're their age.</i>

01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:26.469
You really think you'll make it, huh?

01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:28.869
You ordered the wagon.

01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:32.077
And now, Papa, we'll just sit quietly and wait.

01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:48.311
He was only 18 years old.

01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:54.715
I'm going to take particular delight
in seeing you hang.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.991
<i>(cock crows)</i>

01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:13.551
<i>(snoring)</i>

01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:44.519
Esteban, I ask you to endure great risk for me.

01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:48.869
Esteban, make your choice.

01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:53.270
All trussed up like a pigeon ready for market.

01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:00.710
Bring those rifles and cartridges.

01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:34.436
Yahoo! Comanchero!

01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:38.633
Comanchero! Comanchero!

01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:41.678
<i>(Graile continues yelling)</i>

01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:24.477
Charge, Monsewer!

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.991
<i>(gunshots)</i>

01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:04.751
<i>(gunshots)</i>

01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:10.151
Hand me that lantern!

01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:37.551
Look!

01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:32.472
Paul!

01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:00.989
Yah, it's the rangers!
The best in Texas! Ha-ha!

01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:10.831
Load this.

01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:20.155
Well, Monsewer.

01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:25.236
Looks like I've lost you again.

01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:31.070
Mr McBain, or whatever your name is,

01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:33.116
we'll miss you.

01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:35.794
We've kind of gotten used to you.

01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:48.911
Big Jake! Don't forget to mend those fences.
