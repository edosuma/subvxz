You know how
embarrassing that is?

16:56.618 --> 16:58.452
I don't know, maybe as long as

16:58.453 --> 17:00.454
you've been keeping track of
my periods on your calendar.

17:00.455 --> 17:02.590
Wh... that?

17:02.591 --> 17:05.492
Yeah, so I keep track of
a lot of things on my calendar.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.627
Tom Petty's tour dates,
your ovulation cycle,

17:07.628 --> 17:09.396

17:09.396 --> 17:11.031
You know what
the worst part is, Danny?

17:11.031 --> 17:15.102
That I thought you were being
really romantic this week.

17:15.103 --> 17:16.869
I loved it. It was wonderful,

17:16.871 --> 17:18.305
but really you were just trying

17:18.306 --> 17:19.807
to trick me into
getting pregnant.

17:19.808 --> 17:22.576
Look, I'm sorry,
but I'm not sorry

17:22.577 --> 17:24.111
that I want a bigger family.

17:24.112 --> 17:25.945
Look, listen to me.

17:25.946 --> 17:27.247
I never wanted kids
before I met you

17:27.248 --> 17:29.083
and you made me be
the kind of guy that does,

17:29.084 --> 17:30.718
and now all off a sudden
that's a bad thing?

17:30.719 --> 17:32.152
No, it's not a bad thing, Danny.

17:32.153 --> 17:34.855
It is fine for you to want kids,

17:34.856 --> 17:36.290
if that's what I also wanted.

17:36.291 --> 17:37.658
Oh, yeah, right,
right, your career.

17:37.659 --> 17:39.426
You're too busy getting
half of Manhattan

17:39.427 --> 17:40.594

he's just out there
by himself alone,

17:42.597 --> 17:44.098
playing pat-a-cake
against the wall

17:44.099 --> 17:45.299
while his mom's working?

17:45.300 --> 17:46.867
- There! You're doing it again.
- What?

17:46.868 --> 17:50.070
Every time that you disagree
with something that I do,

17:50.071 --> 17:51.739
it's a referendum
on my character.

17:51.740 --> 17:53.674
If I want to go to work,
it means I'm a bad mother.

17:53.675 --> 17:55.576
If I want to have
a second glass of wine,

17:55.577 --> 17:56.844
it means I'm out of control.

17:56.845 --> 17:59.446
- Come on! Don't exaggerate.
- I'm not!

17:59.447 --> 18:01.248
In your eyes,
every single thing I do

18:01.249 --> 18:03.150
is more evidence
that I'm a bad person.

18:03.151 --> 18:04.485
You're not a bad person.

18:04.486 --> 18:06.120
You want me to help you make
good decisions, don't you?

18:06.121 --> 18:07.721
Yeah, I thought
I made good decisions,

18:07.722 --> 18:09.862
and now you're just making
all the decisions for me.

18:09.982 --> 18:11.859
So what,
if it's the right decision?

18:11.860 --> 18:13.160
Look, Mindy. Look at me.

18:13.161 --> 18:14.325
You are an amazing mom.

18:14.445 --> 18:16.030
Any child would
love to be with you.

18:16.031 --> 18:17.231
Would love to have you as a mom.

18:17.232 --> 18:18.454
Why not do it again?

18:18.574 --> 18:21.268
I'm also a good doctor.

18:21.269 --> 18:23.604
I don't want to have
to give up any more

18:23.605 --> 18:25.173
to have more kids.

18:29.511 --> 18:32.046
- That's selfish.
- I'm selfish?

18:32.047 --> 18:33.213
Yes!

18:33.214 --> 18:35.082
Was it selfish when
I took care of our son

18:35.083 --> 18:36.917

18:36.918 --> 18:38.018
while you were
across the country

18:38.019 --> 18:39.486

your estranged father?

18:39.487 --> 18:40.521
My dad had a heart attack.

18:40.522 --> 18:41.722
What did you want me to do?
Abandon him?

18:41.723 --> 18:43.590
Or you could have hired a nurse,

18:43.591 --> 18:45.159
or you could have asked
your younger brother

18:45.160 --> 18:46.593
- to help, but you didn't.
- Okay.

18:46.594 --> 18:49.730
Whenever you decide to do something,
it's selfless,

18:49.731 --> 18:52.166

do something, it's selfish.

18:52.167 --> 18:54.134

18:59.174 --> 19:00.708
Maybe I need to be
the judge and jury

19:00.709 --> 19:03.043
because I make better
choices than you do.

19:03.044 --> 19:04.478

through consequences.
