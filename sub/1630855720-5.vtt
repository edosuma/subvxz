01:28.672 --> 01:31.508
<i>Whomsoever is not taught by the mother...</i>

01:33.552 --> 01:35.512
<i>will be taught with the world.</i>

01:52.905 --> 01:53.739
Hey.

01:55.532 --> 02:00.120
- I saw an old woman at the waterfall.
- The waterfall?

02:01.455 --> 02:02.289
Yes.

02:02.581 --> 02:04.750
You must never go back to the lagoon.

02:05.167 --> 02:06.210
What?

02:06.210 --> 02:07.336
It's haunted.

02:07.878 --> 02:09.170
Badly haunted.

02:09.170 --> 02:12.049
The washer woman - she is a witch.

02:13.050 --> 02:13.884
A witch...

02:13.884 --> 02:15.511
Whatever you do...

02:15.511 --> 02:17.721
You must not go back there.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.349
And never... ever...

02:20.349 --> 02:22.518
let that woman touch you!

02:40.452 --> 02:44.540
<i>It's mythical, what women are capable of.</i>

02:45.874 --> 02:50.045
<i>Too terrifying a mystery,
too layered and complex.</i>

02:51.755 --> 02:53.173
<i>Powerful beasts...</i>

02:55.551 --> 02:58.262
<i>They cannot comprehend what women do,</i>

02:58.762 --> 03:03.267
<i>so they try to take their power,
snuff out their unique light.</i>

03:03.976 --> 03:06.520
<i>Always have, always will.</i>

03:09.106 --> 03:11.233
<i>Scared of the magic inside.</i>

03:12.067 --> 03:14.236
<i>Can't see it? Look harder.</i>

03:16.405 --> 03:18.991
<i>Look harder. Look harder.</i>

04:53.669 --> 04:55.587
You did not ask for the tree's permission.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.342
Sorry.

06:38.899 --> 06:39.858
I may?

06:43.153 --> 06:44.238
Okay.

06:47.449 --> 06:48.909
Okay. I make pee.

06:48.909 --> 06:49.993
Okay.

10:18.577 --> 10:23.498
<i>She was looking into that camera lens
like a fucking sorceress, Apollo.</i>

12:03.557 --> 12:07.186
<i>They bathe it at dusk.
They hide it with guile.</i>

12:08.228 --> 12:14.318
<i>At home in the forest,
forever lost in the wild.</i>

12:15.068 --> 12:16.236
Apollo?

12:22.117 --> 12:23.577
Good morning, Pearl.

12:25.454 --> 12:27.331
Pearl Walker,

12:28.457 --> 12:32.836
raised off the coast of Maine,
in trouble for habitual shoplifting.

12:34.129 --> 12:38.008
Heavy drinker. Mother of one.

12:42.721 --> 12:44.806
Now, do you remember the name
of your high school mascot?

12:44.806 --> 12:47.309
'Cause, you know, if you forgot,
I'd be happy to tell you--

12:47.309 --> 12:50.896
I was gonna douse you with gasoline
last night and light you on fire.

12:52.189 --> 12:56.527
And then I stopped myself and I thought,
"No. Gretta will wanna do that."

12:57.027 --> 12:58.737
So I sent a boat to fetch her.

12:58.737 --> 13:01.907
And what about my daughter?

13:01.907 --> 13:03.575
You mean, the one you killed?

13:03.575 --> 13:05.494
- Wait.
- You won't even see her in the afterlife!

13:05.494 --> 13:08.413
- Hold on.
- Sorceress. Enchantress.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.457
Every word you speak is a lie.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.292
Hold on.
You said that he killed his daughter.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.878
That's not right.
He actually came here to get them.

13:14.878 --> 13:17.047
- Right, William?
- She's lying, you nitwit.

13:17.047 --> 13:20.926
She's casting a spell.
That's what witches do.

13:21.885 --> 13:23.971
I've decided to give you one more chance.

13:25.264 --> 13:26.265
Why?

13:26.849 --> 13:28.058
You don't want it?

13:30.435 --> 13:31.687
How do I know if I go out there,

13:31.687 --> 13:33.355
you're not gonna
put two bullets in my head?

13:33.355 --> 13:36.066
You don't.
Even so, what could you do about it?

13:39.778 --> 13:42.072
Emma told me about you, Apollo.

13:42.906 --> 13:44.116
She said you'd come,

13:44.825 --> 13:48.495
and I told her no one short of a god
could find us on our island.

13:49.371 --> 13:52.332
And here you are, just as she said...

13:55.377 --> 13:59.548
She didn't mention
you'd be bringing anyone with you.

14:02.176 --> 14:07.264
I will give you a second chance.
You won't get a third. Come on.

14:23.822 --> 14:25.282
Don't forget me, Apollo.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.826
Don't forget me, brother!

14:38.170 --> 14:40.839
- Mind your head.
- Damn.

14:47.054 --> 14:50.015
It's almost like that guy
is not the same person I met.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.476
He was just sweet.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.105
What in the actual fuck is going on?

14:58.565 --> 15:02.277
Are you gonna kill me? 'Cause if you are,
I really don't care. I do not care.

15:02.277 --> 15:05.280
Just-- I wanna know, before I die,
what happened to Emma?

15:05.280 --> 15:07.157
Things will become clear in due course,

15:07.157 --> 15:09.201
but without haste
so there are no misconceptions.

15:09.201 --> 15:10.410
- Is she here?
- No.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.412
Well, can you send a boat to fetch her
like you did Gretta?

15:12.412 --> 15:15.707
There is no boat that can bring Emma
back from where she is.

15:17.042 --> 15:21.088
There's no boat, there's no car,
there's no plane, there's no train.

15:21.672 --> 15:23.340
What does that even mean?

15:24.675 --> 15:26.176
She is out there, Apollo.

15:27.010 --> 15:30.556
But there are things that must be
understood before you go out there too.

15:30.556 --> 15:33.141
This cloak-and-dagger bullshit.
Where is she?

15:46.071 --> 15:48.532
It doesn't feel the way
I thought it would...

15:51.785 --> 15:56.331
I-- didn't think it would hurt so much.

15:58.625 --> 16:02.921
You know, just this deep pit of sorrow,

16:04.131 --> 16:05.132
and...

16:07.718 --> 16:12.181
Look, I know I'm supposed
to love you unconditionally...

16:16.185 --> 16:17.603
but I feel panic...

16:21.440 --> 16:23.233
and it's suffocating the love.

16:27.613 --> 16:33.035
I'm trying to tell you, baby...

16:35.329 --> 16:38.040
that I wish I was a better mom for you.

16:43.712 --> 16:45.088
I'm scared for us.

16:48.550 --> 16:52.638
What happens if we don't make it?

17:09.195 --> 17:12.074
- Best night ever.
- The best.

17:13.157 --> 17:14.701
Yo!

17:14.701 --> 17:15.868
Sorry, babe.

17:15.868 --> 17:20.040
Yo! Okay, bouquet time. Get in. Get in.

17:22.542 --> 17:26.588
Okay. I am looking
for some real competition here.

17:26.588 --> 17:30.175
I want Olympic-level shit.

17:30.175 --> 17:32.052
I know you got this, sis.

17:32.052 --> 17:37.432
Okay. And if you catch this,
I love you the most...

17:41.353 --> 17:43.689
- Ready? Okay.
- Yes! Yes, let's do this!

17:43.689 --> 17:45.399
Okay. Here we go.

18:06.545 --> 18:09.256
I love you, New York City!

18:16.346 --> 18:17.431
Somebody got it.

18:22.394 --> 18:24.479
I wish you could have known me back then.

18:27.399 --> 18:31.320
I wish you knew a different Mommy.

18:34.364 --> 18:35.657
I wish she was here.

20:05.163 --> 20:06.164
What?

20:15.257 --> 20:16.300
Fuck you.

20:20.137 --> 20:21.471
Fuck!

20:26.143 --> 20:27.436
Emma?

20:30.564 --> 20:31.732
I'm good.

20:33.525 --> 20:34.735
Hey, are you okay--

20:36.069 --> 20:38.238
<i>We're not going to kill you, Apollo.</i>

20:38.822 --> 20:39.907
Not unless you make us.

20:41.533 --> 20:45.287
That's a relief
and also not a relief at all.

20:51.919 --> 20:53.295
This is for you.

20:53.295 --> 20:54.588
No way.

20:55.422 --> 20:58.008
Emma and I spent many late nights
up talking.

21:00.302 --> 21:04.890
Emma Valentine, alive and well,
on a random island.

21:05.933 --> 21:09.186
Not so well. Alive though.

21:11.313 --> 21:16.276
She talked to me about your father,
about this book, how much it meant to you.

21:18.737 --> 21:24.660
Betraying my innermost secrets
to a perfect stranger. It checks.

21:25.160 --> 21:29.039
It's interesting you find this story
so captivating.

21:30.666 --> 21:34.169
- Why?
- Because of where you have found yourself.

21:35.796 --> 21:38.173
Estrogen Island, New York City? I mean...

21:42.553 --> 21:43.554
Sorry.

22:07.828 --> 22:10.831
I will not let you gaslight me.

22:11.540 --> 22:14.960
I will not let you make me feel crazy.
Okay?

22:40.569 --> 22:42.779
You're not gonna make me think I'm crazy.

23:31.537 --> 23:32.871
I don't want to.

23:34.081 --> 23:35.082
I don't.

23:35.749 --> 23:39.378
Baby, I really. I really--

23:41.964 --> 23:42.965
God.

23:44.967 --> 23:45.968
Help me.

24:09.408 --> 24:15.080
I love my baby,
more than you can ever know.

24:19.543 --> 24:21.211
I'll give up anything for him.

24:22.588 --> 24:24.089
I'll give my life for him.

24:27.009 --> 24:28.135
My husband's...

24:32.264 --> 24:33.682
and yours.

24:53.827 --> 24:56.413
I'm sorry. I am.

25:03.629 --> 25:06.173
You were in New York
when you got on Wheeler's boat.

25:07.549 --> 25:11.261
And for a while you stayed in
the East River, you passed Rikers Island.

25:11.261 --> 25:13.347
Maybe you went
under the Throgs Neck Bridge.

25:13.347 --> 25:17.935
But as you approached our island,
you crossed into different waters.

25:18.727 --> 25:21.021
You beached that boat
on a different shore.

25:21.021 --> 25:24.107
Has anyone ever told you
that you speak in riddles?

25:24.858 --> 25:27.444
You know, the Amazons were said
to live on the island of Themiscyra

25:27.444 --> 25:30.822
and the Yolngu had an island for the dead.

25:31.532 --> 25:32.866
These were magical places,

25:34.159 --> 25:36.495
where the rules of your world
are not the same.

25:37.704 --> 25:39.873
And you have crossed into such a place.

25:42.084 --> 25:46.713
Right, but this is North Brother Island.
It's a place, it's on maps.

25:46.713 --> 25:49.591
It was North Brother Island,
until we remade it.

26:34.970 --> 26:35.971
A schoolhouse?

26:36.555 --> 26:39.099
Yes. A library too, we're proud of it.

26:40.184 --> 26:42.269
Wow, very cool.

26:43.645 --> 26:44.897
Are you hungry?

26:45.647 --> 26:47.316
Yeah. Yeah.

26:48.942 --> 26:53.280
You know, I used to daydream about
when Brian would finally go to school.

26:54.448 --> 26:58.076
I'd be that crazy dad spying on him,
making everyone nervous

26:58.076 --> 27:00.787
and they'd wanna call the police
'cause some strange guy's staring at kids

27:00.787 --> 27:01.914
through the window.

27:02.873 --> 27:06.210
We spy on children all the time now,
nobody calls the police.

27:08.253 --> 27:11.340
Social media. Poisonous trap.

27:12.257 --> 27:14.593
People happily hand over their babies,

27:14.593 --> 27:18.096
their private, most precious moments
every day for the world to see.

27:19.515 --> 27:20.516
Yeah.

27:21.558 --> 27:24.019
Leaving the door open
to the creatures of the night.

27:27.147 --> 27:28.315
We take our meals here.

27:35.447 --> 27:37.282
What brings you to this choice?

27:40.452 --> 27:41.703
Emma?

27:44.331 --> 27:45.332
Sorry?

27:45.874 --> 27:47.459
What brings you to this choice?

27:50.420 --> 27:53.173
So, where are we baptizing him?

27:54.174 --> 27:55.509
We actually weren't--

27:55.509 --> 27:58.887
Unless one is born of water and spirit,
he cannot be saved.

27:58.887 --> 28:00.722
Saved from?

28:01.515 --> 28:03.350
The dark creatures of the world.

28:07.729 --> 28:09.189
And do you believe that?

28:11.024 --> 28:12.442
I don't know what I believe,

28:13.652 --> 28:18.949
but I know that I want to try everything

28:20.325 --> 28:23.912
to make sure that the road is easier.

28:27.040 --> 28:32.671
You say you describe yourself as spiritual
but not religious?

28:34.381 --> 28:38.594
- Right.
- Yeah. And your husband?

28:40.596 --> 28:41.597
Atheist.

28:43.807 --> 28:48.353
And how does your husband feel
about the idea of your son being baptized?

28:56.445 --> 29:00.616
He's not yet awake.

29:02.201 --> 29:05.245
All right. Well, there's nothing like
a beautiful ceremony

29:05.245 --> 29:08.248
to awaken one's soul
and perhaps hear the call.

29:09.416 --> 29:12.377
I remember so clearly the moment
I heard God's voice calling me. I just--

29:12.377 --> 29:14.004
Do you have any openings immediately?

29:15.797 --> 29:19.301
I just wanna get this done
and dusted, ASAP.

29:21.678 --> 29:25.015
Okay, right. Yeah. Sure.

29:25.015 --> 29:28.018
Let's take a little look
at the diary, shall we?

29:34.358 --> 29:35.734
Good morning, ladies.

29:41.573 --> 29:44.785
Hey. How long was Emma here?

29:45.494 --> 29:47.579
On and off for a couple of months.

29:48.956 --> 29:51.750
She used to go back into New York
once a week.

29:51.750 --> 29:55.045
She saw how depleted our library was
and she restocked it.

29:56.672 --> 29:59.299
To her, a life without books
wasn't worth living.

30:00.050 --> 30:01.051
It's not.

30:01.051 --> 30:03.303
She couldn't stop being a librarian.

30:03.303 --> 30:05.180
That's for you. Hang on.

30:07.224 --> 30:08.976
This is good on a cold morning.

30:11.603 --> 30:12.604
Here we go.

30:19.444 --> 30:21.697
There we go. How's that?

30:22.281 --> 30:24.283
You'd make a great dad.

30:26.076 --> 30:27.202
<i>You know that?</i>

30:30.038 --> 30:32.040
How did she get back and forth?

30:32.040 --> 30:33.792
We have our own Navy.

30:35.127 --> 30:36.628
That's an exaggeration.

30:37.504 --> 30:42.134
We have a trawler and a single-person
creek boat with a paddle.

30:43.343 --> 30:46.346
Wait a minute. What? No, she did not
know how to use a creek boat.

30:46.346 --> 30:48.473
Yeah. She had some spills along the way.

30:50.809 --> 30:54.062
But she never gives up.
Your wife has quite a will.

30:54.062 --> 30:55.189
Yeah, I know that.

31:03.280 --> 31:05.991
So, all these women, they--

31:07.868 --> 31:09.870
they like-- Like what Emma did?

31:11.413 --> 31:12.497
Yes. All of us.

31:13.248 --> 31:15.626
Well, what about the kids
I saw out earlier?

31:15.626 --> 31:17.503
Some of them have more than one child.

31:17.503 --> 31:20.464
So, when they run to me,
they bring their other children.

31:23.258 --> 31:26.637
Women come here bereft and confused,

31:26.637 --> 31:30.891
and I offered them a place
where they will be believed.

31:32.392 --> 31:35.896
Do you know how few women
ever get that simple gift?

31:37.814 --> 31:39.149
Works miracles.

31:52.329 --> 31:56.667
Do you understand
her enormous strength, Apollo?

31:57.626 --> 31:58.877
What that took?

31:58.877 --> 32:01.964
Used to be advice was passed
from woman to woman.

32:02.756 --> 32:06.885
Drawn from the well of her knowledge.
How we do this hard, hard thing.

32:08.470 --> 32:11.640
I reach back to my mother
and she holds my hand

32:12.349 --> 32:15.853
and she reaches back
to her mother before that.

32:16.770 --> 32:19.982
One continuous chain of information.

32:19.982 --> 32:24.528
Back and back and back and back.

32:34.037 --> 32:36.248
"Babies are dreams made real.

32:37.624 --> 32:40.419
And dreams are fairies' favorite meal."

32:41.545 --> 32:44.464
"There at the window
they watch while it sleeps.

32:44.464 --> 32:47.843
A child so beautiful,
the fairies all weep.

32:50.179 --> 32:53.932
We want it, we need it.
It's ours for the taking.

32:54.850 --> 32:57.936
Tap at the latch
and the window is shaking."

32:57.936 --> 33:01.106
- This book is so fucked up.
- It's good.

33:04.067 --> 33:06.195
"Mother and father asleep in their bed.

33:06.195 --> 33:09.072
Fit for the grave,
they rest like the dead.

33:10.741 --> 33:13.368
Fairies will hold it
close to their breast.

33:13.869 --> 33:15.120
They won't give it back.

33:15.662 --> 33:17.623
- They love it the best."
- "Love it the best."

33:23.337 --> 33:28.926
I don't know why your father read
this book to you when you were little.

33:29.426 --> 33:30.427
I don't know.

33:33.889 --> 33:35.140
But it tells the truth.

33:39.811 --> 33:42.147
Emma willed you here, Apollo.

33:43.732 --> 33:45.484
To the truth, if you dare to see it.

33:46.652 --> 33:50.364
You and she have ended up
in one ugly fairy tale.

33:51.865 --> 33:55.118
And it won't do to shut your eyes
or to pretend otherwise.

33:55.118 --> 33:57.162
You've crossed the waters.
You can't go back.

33:58.914 --> 34:01.708
William was right
about at least one thing. We are witches.

34:03.794 --> 34:05.754
But I'll tell you something else
he was right about.

34:06.338 --> 34:09.049
The man in that cage
consorts with monsters.

34:11.552 --> 34:12.469
<i>"Got him."</i>

34:13.469 --> 34:18.391
That's what the text said.
Right under his picture in caps.

34:19.101 --> 34:21.395
- "Got him."
- You know what? Show me.

34:21.395 --> 34:22.563
- Show me.
- They're gone.

34:22.563 --> 34:24.356
- Show me one text that says--
- You already know they're--

34:24.356 --> 34:26.567
- That's because it was never there.
- Let's just get ready.

34:26.567 --> 34:28.025
We're not going to church with you, Emma.

34:29.277 --> 34:31.947
You probably wanna get him
an exorcism rather than a baptism.

34:32.739 --> 34:35.909
The message board said we can try therapy
or church, and we can't afford therapy.

34:35.909 --> 34:37.159
It's all about the message board.

34:37.159 --> 34:39.246
I'm delighted you think a bunch of
old women can tell us

34:39.246 --> 34:40.998
how to live our lives and raise our kid.

34:40.998 --> 34:42.583
But you know what the problem is, Emma?

34:42.583 --> 34:44.793
It's you.
You're the fucking problem, all right?

34:44.793 --> 34:46.795
Why don't you go take
another pill or something?

34:54.511 --> 34:56.013
You don't see, but you will.

35:00.475 --> 35:04.021
I didn't believe her.
I thought she was sick.

35:08.108 --> 35:09.109
And now?

35:14.448 --> 35:15.449
I don't know.

35:17.367 --> 35:20.954
I don't know but I want to.

35:25.125 --> 35:26.126
I want to.

35:30.005 --> 35:32.174
- I got it.
- Over here.

35:41.141 --> 35:42.476
You're okay.

35:43.393 --> 35:44.228
Yeah.

35:44.228 --> 35:47.606
You know that's what my wife used to say
to me when I would have nightmares.

35:50.609 --> 35:51.944
Oh, my gosh.

35:53.237 --> 35:57.991
Scooters can be tricky, huh?
Hey. You all right?

35:58.867 --> 36:01.620
Here. You need some help?

36:03.080 --> 36:04.206
My name's Apollo.

36:04.706 --> 36:05.707
This is Gayl.

36:06.500 --> 36:10.128
Hi. Do you want me to help you find
a Band-Aid or-- I mean, I could go--

36:11.129 --> 36:13.131
- They don't see men ever here.
- Yeah.

36:13.924 --> 36:14.758
Not again.

36:14.758 --> 36:15.843
- Here you go.
- Yeah.

36:15.843 --> 36:17.761
Hey. You okay?

36:19.596 --> 36:22.724
There you go. Wow. You're tough.

36:22.724 --> 36:24.101
She's tough.

36:24.101 --> 36:26.937
- Looks like you made a friend.
- Yeah. Okay.

36:31.775 --> 36:33.443
Don't know where we're going, but--

36:36.321 --> 36:40.868
- Hey. I have to talk to you about Gretta.
- What for?

36:41.493 --> 36:44.079
Well, you know how William
killed his daughter?

36:44.079 --> 36:45.873
- He did.
- Yeah, well--

36:47.666 --> 36:49.835
Honey, why don't you go inside,
find a book?

36:53.172 --> 36:56.633
Okay. Well, all of these women,
they did something similar, okay? So--

36:56.633 --> 37:01.305
No. No, not similar. That's wrong.

37:01.305 --> 37:05.184
All right.
I just wanna hear it from her, okay?

37:05.184 --> 37:06.602
You do, do you?

37:06.602 --> 37:08.812
What? You give a man breakfast
and suddenly he tells you

37:08.812 --> 37:11.732
- all about what he wants?
- Okay. It was a request.

37:12.274 --> 37:14.985
All right, Cal? Please.

37:19.823 --> 37:21.867
Okay. We don't travel the river
during the day,

37:21.867 --> 37:23.410
but Gretta will be here tonight.

37:24.244 --> 37:27.039
Puppet show's after dinner
and if she wants to talk to you,

37:27.039 --> 37:28.123
that'll be the time.

37:31.335 --> 37:32.336
Thank you.

37:39.593 --> 37:41.261
Hey. What you reading?

37:44.598 --> 37:47.017
Looks like a good book.
Do you mind if I read with you?

37:47.518 --> 37:50.437
Okay. All right.

37:50.979 --> 37:53.774
"We want it. We need it.
It's ours for the taking.

37:53.774 --> 37:56.693
A tap at the latch
and the window was shaking.

37:57.236 --> 37:59.363
Mother and father asleep in their bed.

37:59.363 --> 38:02.407
Fit for the grave,
they rest like the dead.

38:03.325 --> 38:06.370
The young one is gone,
but they'll never know,

38:06.370 --> 38:10.123
in its place a thing without life,
hard and cold."

38:13.502 --> 38:14.670
"Now for the fun.

38:14.670 --> 38:17.673
In the woods, there's a party
in the dark past the horses,

38:17.673 --> 38:19.883
the guests are dressed smartly."

38:21.468 --> 38:24.096
"The music is playing,
the dancers move quick.

38:24.596 --> 38:27.516
A child in their arms
will never grow sick."

38:28.684 --> 38:33.438
<i>I had a rooster
The rooster pleased me</i>

38:34.606 --> 38:39.528
<i>I held the rooster
By the old apple tree</i>

38:47.703 --> 38:51.665
What you laughing for?
You remind me of my wife.

38:55.794 --> 38:56.795
My wife.

38:59.464 --> 39:00.465
You okay?

39:02.301 --> 39:03.302
There you go.

39:03.302 --> 39:09.057
<i>I had a rooster
My rooster pleased me</i>

39:10.142 --> 39:15.939
<i>I set my rooster
Underneath the apple tree</i>

39:20.110 --> 39:21.195
What?

39:21.945 --> 39:23.238
Sorry, I just--

39:23.238 --> 39:27.284
I didn't realize my husband was
such an atrocious singer, that's all.

39:27.910 --> 39:28.744
What?

39:31.288 --> 39:33.290
Okay. I'll sing again.

39:35.042 --> 39:36.126
- <i>I had a--</i>
- No.

39:37.836 --> 39:39.129
Uh-uh.

39:41.381 --> 39:42.841
You're so bad.

39:43.634 --> 39:44.968
But I love you.

39:45.928 --> 39:47.471
- Just don't sing again.
- That's not how that works.

39:47.471 --> 39:48.555
Don't sing.

39:51.558 --> 39:54.811
Everybody, come on
for the puppet show, it's time.

39:55.604 --> 39:57.606
Come on, kids. Go get a good seat.

39:58.190 --> 40:03.237
Come on, puppet show.
Rocco. Joey. Zachary. Ivy.

40:03.237 --> 40:07.032
Let's go. Let's go.
Front seats are gonna be taken fast.

40:07.032 --> 40:09.743
- Right. Puppet show. Hey.
- Come on, everybody. Hi.

40:16.458 --> 40:17.459
Gretta.

40:29.680 --> 40:30.681
How's Grace?

40:32.015 --> 40:33.141
She's with my parents.

40:38.814 --> 40:40.107
- William's here?
- Yeah.

40:41.650 --> 40:44.570
He's shown up, just like that?

40:44.570 --> 40:45.946
Well, he came with me.

40:45.946 --> 40:47.030
- You're with him?
- No--

40:47.030 --> 40:48.532
Well, I'm Emma's--

40:49.700 --> 40:51.118
I'm Emma's husband.

40:51.618 --> 40:52.619
It's okay.

40:53.871 --> 40:54.872
I'm Emma's.

40:57.583 --> 40:59.418
I just keep thinking I'll be rid of him.

41:00.711 --> 41:02.754
He keeps finding his way
back into my life.

41:02.754 --> 41:04.506
- I know.
- He won't give up.

41:04.506 --> 41:07.384
We're his, that's what he thinks.

41:09.970 --> 41:12.890
Did he-- Did he--

41:12.890 --> 41:13.974
Kill my daughter?

41:14.933 --> 41:17.686
- He said--
- Oh, yes. Please, tell me what he said.

41:17.686 --> 41:20.647
I came all the way here just to have you
explain his point of view to me.

41:22.900 --> 41:23.901
Okay.

41:28.071 --> 41:31.825
He got my new address.
He mailed me a book.

41:32.951 --> 41:37.581
- Book?
- <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>. He ruined it.

41:39.708 --> 41:40.709
What?

41:40.709 --> 41:42.920
Wrote the same thing on every page.

41:44.338 --> 41:46.798
He cleared me out.

41:47.883 --> 41:52.930
- Every last penny right out of my account.
- Wait. How much--

41:53.597 --> 41:54.598
What did he take?

41:55.265 --> 41:56.558
Seventy-thousand.

41:59.603 --> 42:04.191
- What?
- That bastard stole $70,000 from me.

42:07.819 --> 42:08.987
What did he write?

42:11.323 --> 42:12.533
Her name.

42:12.533 --> 42:14.034
Agnes! Agnes! Agnes!

42:14.618 --> 42:18.413
Agnes. On every page.

42:36.431 --> 42:38.058
William! Hey.

42:44.231 --> 42:48.443
William! William, come talk to me now!

42:49.486 --> 42:51.655
That's not my name,
so stop fucking using it.

42:51.655 --> 42:53.991
Yes, it is. I just talked to your wife.

42:53.991 --> 42:55.951
And will my family be whole again?

42:55.951 --> 43:00.455
She said, "William stole $70,000 from me."
She said, you defaced that book.

43:01.999 --> 43:03.959
You know,
I didn't know my real name either.

43:05.252 --> 43:06.712
Didn't know who I really was.

43:08.297 --> 43:09.131
What?

43:09.131 --> 43:11.300
And then I found a place where I belonged.

43:11.884 --> 43:14.595
I found people who understood me.

43:16.471 --> 43:18.891
I could talk to them
like I never talked to anyone else.

43:20.976 --> 43:25.689
And when I found my people,
I took off William Wheeler's face.

43:34.072 --> 43:36.283
And I found my true face beneath.

43:39.119 --> 43:42.789
And when my friends saw
my authentic identity...

43:44.791 --> 43:47.252
they gave me my true name.

43:49.755 --> 43:53.884
In fact, Apollo, you know it already.

43:56.803 --> 43:58.096
How do I know?

44:00.265 --> 44:01.934
Dinner plans tonight,

44:03.268 --> 44:07.356
a meal inspired by baby Brian,

44:08.857 --> 44:10.984
boiled vegetables.

44:13.111 --> 44:14.279
Kinder Garten!
