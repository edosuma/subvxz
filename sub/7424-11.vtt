00:01.976 --> 00:04.278
<i>Nine years ago I witnessed</i>
<i>my mother's murder.</i>

00:04.280 --> 00:08.121
<i>I would've been killed, too,</i>
<i>if it hadn't been for Vincent.</i>

00:08.221 --> 00:10.739
<i>I was part of an experimental</i>
<i>Special Forces group.</i>

00:10.741 --> 00:14.059
<i>Their goal was to create</i>
<i>the perfect super soldier.</i>

00:14.061 --> 00:16.111
<i>But something went wrong.</i>

00:16.113 --> 00:17.312
You're him.

00:17.314 --> 00:21.833
<i>Being in any relationship,</i>
<i>it's a risk.</i>

00:21.835 --> 00:24.670
Dr. Forbes, it's about
something that you wrote.

00:24.672 --> 00:25.904
That was years ago.

00:25.906 --> 00:28.840
I have evidence that a
cross-species creature exists.

00:28.842 --> 00:30.592
I could do with a biochemist.

00:30.594 --> 00:33.061
I'd include you in all
aspects of the investigation.

00:33.063 --> 00:35.547
<i>My nurse, you might know her?</i>

00:35.549 --> 00:36.848
We grew up together.

00:36.850 --> 00:38.266
We were pretty close.

00:38.268 --> 00:39.267
They said you were dead.

00:39.269 --> 00:41.069
You should've
just given up on me.

00:41.071 --> 00:43.889
<i>I loved you.</i>

00:43.891 --> 00:46.475
Maybe I've been misreading us.

00:56.870 --> 00:58.437
Hi.

00:58.439 --> 01:00.939
Hey.

01:00.941 --> 01:02.774
Remind me never
to get shot again.

01:02.776 --> 01:03.825
Never get shot again.

01:03.827 --> 01:05.877
Come in.

01:05.879 --> 01:08.280
Thanks.

01:08.282 --> 01:11.950
Now put the
dumbbell down.

01:11.952 --> 01:13.618
Why do I get
the feeling

01:13.620 --> 01:15.470
that this is going
to hurt even worse?

01:15.472 --> 01:17.723
Give me your hands.
Come on.

01:17.725 --> 01:19.558
You need to work
on your flexibility.

01:19.560 --> 01:20.976
I don't remember
asking you

01:20.978 --> 01:23.294
to be my personal
physical therapist.

01:23.296 --> 01:25.147
Okay.
Okay.

01:25.149 --> 01:27.099
Slightly back, that's it.
Okay.

01:27.101 --> 01:30.402
Careful.

01:30.404 --> 01:31.737
You know, the first time
I got shot in Afghanistan,

01:31.739 --> 01:32.988
I couldn't sleep for months.

01:32.990 --> 01:36.408
Yeah, it's like
I'm sleepwalking.

01:36.410 --> 01:37.809
I can't do anything,

01:37.811 --> 01:39.411
and they've got me
on restrictive duty

01:39.413 --> 01:42.614
until I am physically
and emotionally up to par.

01:44.034 --> 01:47.035
And, again.

01:47.037 --> 01:48.787
You want to
answer that?

01:48.789 --> 01:52.023
Uh, no, it's okay.
I'll call her back.

01:52.025 --> 01:54.459
Ah, it's Alex.

01:54.461 --> 01:56.545
Really, Vincent,
it's okay.

01:56.547 --> 01:58.513
I don't mind.

01:58.515 --> 02:00.382
Uh, okay, thanks.

02:00.384 --> 02:01.850
Oh...

02:05.805 --> 02:07.773
Look, uh...

02:07.775 --> 02:09.191
Catherine,
the thing is...

02:09.193 --> 02:10.675
You... you don't
have to explain.

02:10.676 --> 02:12.778
She was your fiancée.

02:12.780 --> 02:16.314
You were planning
a life together for years.

02:16.316 --> 02:17.933
Six years
and an entire childhood.

02:19.786 --> 02:22.487
But... you and me...

02:22.489 --> 02:24.372
You and I are...

02:24.374 --> 02:26.158
You know,
I don't know what were are.

02:26.160 --> 02:27.692
We're kind of in no-man's-land.

02:27.694 --> 02:30.629
Yeah, I mean-I mean, we've
hardly even known each other,

02:30.631 --> 02:32.297
what, a few months.

02:36.035 --> 02:39.054
You know,
it's really none of my business.

02:47.730 --> 02:49.314
I'll be right out.

02:49.316 --> 02:51.766
Yeah.

02:51.768 --> 02:56.488
You know,
it's, uh, it's good you called.

02:56.490 --> 02:58.406
There's, um, there's something

02:58.408 --> 03:01.109
that I wanted to talk
to you about, too.

03:01.111 --> 03:04.262
I'll be all yours
if you just give me a sec.

03:13.039 --> 03:16.424
Is this what
you wanted to show me?

03:20.880 --> 03:23.849
No.

03:28.521 --> 03:31.389
This is.

03:41.901 --> 03:44.486
How am I supposed to compete
with six years?

03:44.488 --> 03:46.938
Not to mention the fact
that they grew up together

03:46.940 --> 03:51.493
and that she doesn't know all
the darker sides of him.

03:51.495 --> 03:53.795
But, if I say, hey, pick me,

03:53.797 --> 03:55.997
and ignore that
totally perfect, caring woman

03:55.999 --> 03:57.832
that you planned on spending
your life with,

03:57.834 --> 03:59.617
I am a total bitch.

03:59.619 --> 04:01.169
Aren't I?

04:02.255 --> 04:03.972
Are you?

04:03.974 --> 04:05.807
Don't "are you?" me.

04:05.809 --> 04:07.475
It's bad enough
that I am being forced

04:07.477 --> 04:09.344
to come here just to
get back to full duty.

04:09.346 --> 04:11.062
I could do without
the self-reflective crap.

04:11.064 --> 04:12.630
First of all, let me say

04:12.632 --> 04:14.432
that I am impressed
by your willingness

04:14.434 --> 04:15.633
to open up so quickly...

04:15.635 --> 04:17.736
Yes, I know
the mandatory routine.

04:17.738 --> 04:19.654
The sooner I spill my heart,

04:19.656 --> 04:21.973
the faster I get out of here.

04:21.975 --> 04:23.608
Second, what's mandatory,

04:23.610 --> 04:25.126
is for us to discuss the trauma
that you went through

04:25.128 --> 04:27.746
during the shooting,
not your boyfriend issues.

04:27.748 --> 04:29.331
Oh.

04:29.333 --> 04:31.449
Third, yes,
you would be.

04:31.451 --> 04:33.285
And that's okay.

04:33.287 --> 04:34.485
Sometimes in life
we need to be a bitch

04:34.487 --> 04:37.272
in order to get
what we need.

04:37.274 --> 04:38.707
And you're off to a good start.

04:38.709 --> 04:40.458
Sorry.

04:40.460 --> 04:44.462
I had enough therapy
to last a lifetime

04:44.464 --> 04:45.680
when my mom was killed.

04:45.682 --> 04:48.466
I know,
that is like throwing prime rib

04:48.468 --> 04:50.135
at a Rottweiler.

04:50.137 --> 04:52.270
Interesting choice of dog.
They're beautiful.

04:52.272 --> 04:53.888
And dangerous.

04:53.890 --> 04:57.175
No offense, Doctor...

04:57.177 --> 04:59.194
Oh, David.

04:59.196 --> 05:00.862
But I don't need a shrink

05:00.864 --> 05:02.731
to figure out
what my problems are.

05:02.733 --> 05:04.316
You mean running away from

05:04.318 --> 05:06.358
tough emotions and throwing
yourself into your work?

05:07.453 --> 05:09.120
I read your file.

05:09.122 --> 05:11.706
I hope it was a good read.
Mm-hmm.

05:11.708 --> 05:14.960
And from your file,
my conjecture is

05:14.962 --> 05:16.527
you lean on
your crutches:

05:16.529 --> 05:18.696
work, protecting people...

05:18.698 --> 05:20.582
Yes, I took an oath.

05:20.584 --> 05:22.300
To serve and protect.

05:22.302 --> 05:24.502
But who are
you really protecting?

06:10.433 --> 06:12.517
Catherine?

06:13.686 --> 06:15.303
Alex. Hey, hi.

06:15.305 --> 06:17.088
What are you doing here?

06:17.090 --> 06:18.473
I was just jumping
through hoops.

06:18.475 --> 06:19.757
Had to get a final evaluation

06:19.759 --> 06:21.393
before they return me
to full duty.

06:21.395 --> 06:22.727
What are you doing?

06:22.729 --> 06:24.362
I'm just heading home.
Running late.

06:24.364 --> 06:25.730
For... the gym?

06:25.732 --> 06:28.867
Oh, no,
it's, uh, change of clothes.

06:28.869 --> 06:31.953
I live a very glamorous life.

06:33.540 --> 06:34.956
Well, that's my ride.

06:34.958 --> 06:35.957
See you.

06:35.959 --> 06:38.543
Bye.

06:46.335 --> 06:47.919
<i>Someone please explain to me</i>

06:47.921 --> 06:51.339
how a guy who's unemployed,
never goes out,

06:51.341 --> 06:53.725
and is officially dead,
gets not one,

06:53.727 --> 06:57.011
but two smoking hot women
fighting for his attention.

06:57.013 --> 06:59.464
No, JT, the whole point
of going over there

06:59.466 --> 07:01.983
was to tell her
that I can't see her anymore.

07:01.985 --> 07:04.069
Because...

07:04.071 --> 07:05.320
because of Catherine.

07:05.322 --> 07:07.105
Kind of, yeah.

07:07.107 --> 07:10.141
I mean,
Catherine's life has

07:10.143 --> 07:13.244
never been the same since
she found out about me.

07:13.246 --> 07:14.496
And my secret.

07:14.498 --> 07:16.247
Neither has yours.

07:17.666 --> 07:22.003
You and Catherine, you risk
so much to keep me safe.

07:22.005 --> 07:24.172
And you don't want Alex
to take the same risks.

07:24.174 --> 07:25.507
No.

07:25.509 --> 07:28.209
Okay, but what if
I don't tell her?

07:28.211 --> 07:29.327
Vincent.

07:29.329 --> 07:30.795
Look, I know what you're going
to say,

07:30.797 --> 07:34.182
okay, but, JT,
to have someone look at you

07:34.184 --> 07:37.102
and not feel like
you've got this big secret

07:37.104 --> 07:38.586
that they have to protect,
you know.

07:38.588 --> 07:40.388
Like Catherine does.

07:40.390 --> 07:42.006
Yeah.

07:42.008 --> 07:45.860
But, JT, I... I loved Alex.

07:45.862 --> 07:49.614
You know, we spent our whole
childhoods planning everything,

07:49.616 --> 07:51.866
and then... ah.

07:51.868 --> 07:53.651
I don't know,
I guess I got afraid.

07:53.653 --> 07:56.204
And you don't think
Catherine's just backing off

07:56.206 --> 07:58.740
because she's trying
to do the right thing?

08:01.360 --> 08:04.546
How did I end up
on Catherine's side of this?

08:04.548 --> 08:05.797
My side of what?

08:05.799 --> 08:08.750
All you, my friend.

08:15.175 --> 08:18.092
What's this?

08:18.094 --> 08:19.594
I don't know how
to tell you this,

08:19.596 --> 08:21.846
but I ran into Alex
at the hospital.

08:21.848 --> 08:24.399
She was putting a bunch of
boxes into her duffel bag,

08:24.401 --> 08:28.603
and, it turns out that there
are a bunch of thefts

08:28.605 --> 08:30.321
being reported at that ward.

08:30.323 --> 08:32.222
You've been spying on her?

08:32.225 --> 08:36.394
I followed up
on something I saw.

08:36.395 --> 08:37.861
Vincent,
she's stealing medicine

08:37.864 --> 08:40.063
and supplies from the hospital.

08:40.066 --> 08:41.749
You don't actually know that.

08:41.751 --> 08:44.235
Okay.

08:44.236 --> 08:47.539
You can believe me, or not,

08:47.541 --> 08:50.074
but there is an open
narcotics investigation

08:50.076 --> 08:51.742
into these thefts,

08:51.744 --> 08:54.629
and someone else is going
to find out,

08:54.631 --> 08:56.598
eventually.

08:58.184 --> 09:01.085
Does she know?

09:01.087 --> 09:05.139
I mean,
does she know how careful

09:05.141 --> 09:07.692
she has to be with your secret?

09:08.600 --> 09:10.216
No.

Ah, reading about skydiving
is surprisingly very boring.

09:37.030 --> 09:39.864
Hope what you're doing
is a lot more interesting.

09:39.866 --> 09:41.833
Oh, yeah,
I have sharpened every pencil

09:41.835 --> 09:43.251
in the precinct.

09:43.253 --> 09:44.502
Thank you.

09:44.504 --> 09:46.955
So, how's the case going?

09:46.957 --> 09:49.207
Mm, sorry, partner,
you're out on this one.

09:49.209 --> 09:50.942
Okay, if you don't tell me
about this case,

09:50.944 --> 09:52.944
I am going to make you get
mani-pedis with Heather.

09:54.179 --> 09:55.983
Have you ever heard
of Noah Hawkes?

09:56.008 --> 09:56.916
No.

09:56.917 --> 09:59.750
He's one of Forbes'
wealthiest men under 35.

09:59.752 --> 10:01.352
He went skydiving
with his wife.

10:01.354 --> 10:03.438
Her chute didn't open,
neither did the backup.

10:03.440 --> 10:04.755
That's because the parachute

10:04.757 --> 10:06.757
was definitely tampered with.
Hey, Cat.

10:06.759 --> 10:08.860
Hey. I didn't hear anything.

10:09.928 --> 10:12.647
Based on the latent bacteria
on the rip cord,

10:12.649 --> 10:15.984
it was cut 16 to 20 hours
before the jump.

10:15.986 --> 10:19.120
All right, I'll look
into Noah Hawkes' alibi.

10:19.122 --> 10:20.538
You may want to check
if he's left-handed.

10:20.540 --> 10:21.990
From the angle of the cut,

10:21.992 --> 10:23.625
I'm 99% sure
that the doer was a lefty.

10:23.627 --> 10:25.443
But I did hear that.

10:25.445 --> 10:27.712
That's my cue.

10:28.447 --> 10:30.448
Okay, Tess,

10:30.450 --> 10:32.216
you need to let me work
on this case,

10:32.218 --> 10:34.585
or I am going
to get myself in trouble.

10:34.587 --> 10:36.504
Sorry, Chandler,
Joe laid down the law.

10:36.506 --> 10:38.473
You're to know nothing,
nada, zero.

10:38.475 --> 10:40.425
Zip.

10:42.678 --> 10:44.812
I'm mortified.

10:44.814 --> 10:46.564
If I'd known it was
"towel-only" option...

10:46.566 --> 10:47.965
Oh, God, oh, God.

10:47.967 --> 10:51.853
It just... it started to feel
like old times

10:51.855 --> 10:53.438
and I got carried away.

10:53.440 --> 10:54.739
You know,
when that towel dropped,

10:54.741 --> 10:56.574
I almost got carried away,
too, so...

10:59.778 --> 11:02.313
Look, Alex,
I'm sorry...

11:02.315 --> 11:04.432
No, I know.

11:04.434 --> 11:06.367
This is all so strange.

11:06.369 --> 11:08.036
I mean,

11:08.038 --> 11:10.204
you knew me better than anyone.

11:10.206 --> 11:13.091
Before or since.

11:13.093 --> 11:16.377
I used to think I knew you
better than anyone.

11:16.379 --> 11:18.646
You did know me.

11:18.648 --> 11:22.050
But I am a completely
different person now.

11:23.102 --> 11:24.419
Who isn't?

11:24.421 --> 11:27.305
Vince, I admit,

11:27.307 --> 11:31.509
with you back, it's
all so confusing.

11:31.511 --> 11:34.178
I'm beginning to remember
my old self,

11:34.180 --> 11:36.230
and I want that life

11:36.232 --> 11:39.517
back so badly.

11:39.519 --> 11:42.737
I guess the question is,
do you?

11:42.739 --> 11:47.041
Want to go back in time
to the way we used to be?

11:47.043 --> 11:48.342
Yeah,

11:48.344 --> 11:50.211
yeah, I do.

11:50.213 --> 11:52.080
But...

11:52.082 --> 11:54.832
a lot has changed.

11:57.019 --> 12:00.588
And I guess we both have
a few new secrets, yeah?

12:05.594 --> 12:07.345
She saw me, didn't she?

12:09.716 --> 12:11.733
You could never lie
to me, Vince.

12:11.735 --> 12:13.985
Your handler,

12:13.987 --> 12:16.170
Catherine,

12:16.172 --> 12:18.389
she caught me taking stuff
from the hospital.

12:18.391 --> 12:21.159
I told her that you...

12:21.161 --> 12:22.794
weren't into anything like that.

12:22.796 --> 12:25.496
Actually I am.

12:25.498 --> 12:27.081
Kind of.

12:27.083 --> 12:30.734
You know how you said you
wanted your old life back?

12:30.736 --> 12:34.772
Or parts of it anyway.

12:35.924 --> 12:37.942
I have something to show you.

12:37.944 --> 12:42.263
And no, it's not my linen
collection this time.

13:01.650 --> 13:04.035
Hi.

13:04.037 --> 13:06.237
Hello.

13:07.823 --> 13:10.825
Okay, I never pegged you as
a drug lord, but this...

13:10.827 --> 13:12.443
I have my doubts.

13:12.445 --> 13:14.545
It'll all make sense
in a moment.

13:23.672 --> 13:25.089
What is this place?

13:25.091 --> 13:26.808
Like a care unit?

13:26.810 --> 13:28.226
It's for people
who can't pay

13:28.228 --> 13:31.012
or can't get to
another facility.

13:31.014 --> 13:33.231
There's still a lot of people
our there without jobs,

13:33.233 --> 13:35.066
without any insurance.

13:35.068 --> 13:37.018
They fall through the cracks.

13:37.020 --> 13:40.438
Okay, Mrs. Voluska?

13:40.440 --> 13:43.024
You can take a seat in there.
I'll be right with you.

13:44.610 --> 13:46.110
Um, Nurse Alex?

13:46.995 --> 13:48.362
Who's he?

13:48.364 --> 13:50.164
Um, just a...

13:50.166 --> 13:51.449
Just a friend.

13:52.417 --> 13:53.868
Doctor.

14:06.400 --> 14:07.667
<i>Mr. Hawkes,</i>

14:07.669 --> 14:09.186
did anyone besides
you and your wife

14:09.188 --> 14:11.021
have access
to her parachute?

14:11.023 --> 14:12.489
Am I being interrogated?

14:12.491 --> 14:14.658
No, sir, I'm just trying
to assess the facts.

14:14.660 --> 14:18.111
The facts are that Lisa
and I pack our own chutes.

14:18.113 --> 14:20.997
And the morning of the jump,
nothing was out of place?

14:20.999 --> 14:24.467
No one touches them but us.
I know this is

14:24.469 --> 14:27.087
difficult, I only have
a few more questions to ask you.

14:27.089 --> 14:29.055
You're with Noah Hawkes, right?

14:29.057 --> 14:31.007
I bet you're a one sugar?
Black.

14:31.009 --> 14:32.809
Ah.

14:32.811 --> 14:34.611
I'm on the
Neanderthal diet.

14:34.613 --> 14:36.146
What is the Neanderthal diet?

14:36.148 --> 14:38.181
Nothing a caveman wouldn't eat.

14:38.183 --> 14:40.066
I'm ready to kill somebody
for a carb.

14:40.068 --> 14:42.185
Catherine Chandler.

14:42.187 --> 14:44.470
Pam Davis,
CFO of Hawkes Worldwide.

14:44.472 --> 14:47.407
Ah.

14:47.409 --> 14:49.910
So how is Noah taking it?

14:51.145 --> 14:52.662
He's a wreck.

14:52.664 --> 14:54.497
Plus we're in the middle
of an IPO

14:54.499 --> 14:58.118
and we spent the entire day
before Lisa's death,

14:58.120 --> 14:59.419
uh, in marathon meetings.

14:59.421 --> 15:01.755
Wow, sounds stressful.
Yeah.

15:01.757 --> 15:04.291
Tears me up
to see Noah like this.

15:04.293 --> 15:07.093
Did he have a happy marriage?

15:07.095 --> 15:08.428
Storybook.

15:08.430 --> 15:10.096
Outside of work,

15:10.098 --> 15:11.932
they did everything together.

15:15.219 --> 15:17.520
Lisa and I,

15:17.522 --> 15:19.606
we loved living on the edge.

15:19.608 --> 15:23.643
And we knew with that
risk comes a cost.

15:23.645 --> 15:26.846
I just never dreamed the
price would be so high.

15:26.848 --> 15:28.281
<i>When somebody becomes</i>

15:28.283 --> 15:30.483
that integral to your life

15:30.485 --> 15:32.402
and suddenly they're gone,

15:32.404 --> 15:34.904
it makes you wonder
who you are without them.

15:34.906 --> 15:39.209
Yeah, I have some personal
experience in that department.

15:45.082 --> 15:47.167
Thanks for the coffee.
Yeah.

15:47.169 --> 15:49.886
And if we need to talk
with you further?

15:49.888 --> 15:52.088
I work the rest
of the afternoon,

15:52.090 --> 15:54.507
then tonight there's
this event I have to be at.

15:54.509 --> 15:56.393
That I obviously
don't want to be at.

15:56.395 --> 15:57.560
But that you can't miss.

15:57.562 --> 15:59.529
Exclusive billionaire boys' club

15:59.531 --> 16:01.214
kind of deal at the Dylan Club.

16:01.216 --> 16:03.683
You are more than welcome
to stop by if you need

16:03.685 --> 16:05.435
to pull me aside
for a few minutes.

16:05.437 --> 16:08.738
Call me whenever--
I'll track him down.

16:13.494 --> 16:14.894
We should go to
the Dylan Club.

16:14.896 --> 16:16.529
What, and party
with a suspect?

16:16.531 --> 16:19.833
No, we'll go under the guise
of working on the case.

16:19.835 --> 16:22.052
When in reality we're going...?

16:22.054 --> 16:24.004
About the case.

16:24.006 --> 16:25.705
And because you and I
are both attractive women

16:25.707 --> 16:28.091
who shouldn't be wasting
our youth on available men.

16:28.093 --> 16:29.959
So what, you want to get dressed
up, put on smoky eyes

16:29.961 --> 16:31.378
and fall in love?

16:31.380 --> 16:33.013
Is that it?
That's it exactly.

16:33.015 --> 16:34.914
And, look, if we happen to
catch a break in the case,

16:34.916 --> 16:36.349
it's two birds with one stone.

16:36.351 --> 16:37.967
Preferably a diamond.

16:37.969 --> 16:39.719
The big question is
what to wear.

16:44.860 --> 16:46.426
Leave a message and if I don't

16:46.428 --> 16:47.727
get back to you it's probably

16:47.729 --> 16:49.929
because I don't really like you.

16:49.931 --> 16:51.865
JT, it's Evan Marks.

16:51.867 --> 16:54.868
I think I found another victim
of our cross-species animal.

16:54.870 --> 16:56.786
I have clearance
to exhume the body

16:56.788 --> 16:58.738
and in the spirit
of our partnership,

16:58.740 --> 17:01.274
I thought you'd want to be there
to confirm if it's a match.

17:01.276 --> 17:03.376
Call me. This could be big.

17:04.579 --> 17:06.546
Wow.
Claire.

17:06.548 --> 17:07.946
Someone sounds excited.

17:07.949 --> 17:10.116
What are you doing here?

17:14.221 --> 17:16.089
I know we were supposed

17:16.090 --> 17:18.724
to meet at
the restaurant, but

17:18.727 --> 17:21.294
I thought I'd surprise you.

17:25.098 --> 17:26.900
It's a welcome surprise.

17:26.902 --> 17:29.319
Mm.

17:38.696 --> 17:41.814
A <i>very</i> welcome surprise.

17:45.753 --> 17:47.704
I think restaurants
are overrated.

17:47.706 --> 17:49.989
I find morgues
much more enticing.

17:49.991 --> 17:52.592
As do I.

17:59.100 --> 18:01.584
<i>Okay, buddy,</i>

18:01.586 --> 18:03.636
I'm not gonna lie
to you.

18:03.638 --> 18:05.054
This is not gonna
feel good, okay,

18:05.056 --> 18:06.672
but it's gonna
be over quickly.

18:08.059 --> 18:09.526
Yeah, breathe.

18:09.528 --> 18:11.394
And... one.

18:11.396 --> 18:13.346
And two.

18:13.348 --> 18:15.398
Ow!

18:15.400 --> 18:16.866
Okay?

18:18.520 --> 18:20.520
You didn't count to three.

18:20.522 --> 18:21.988
Yeah.

18:21.990 --> 18:25.542
Well, waiting
for the pain is worse...

18:25.544 --> 18:26.626
Worse than the real thing.

18:26.628 --> 18:28.294
...thing.

18:31.465 --> 18:32.999
You're glowing.

18:34.084 --> 18:36.719
Uh, I'm a guy.
Guys don't glow.

18:36.721 --> 18:38.538
Do they, Milo? Okay.

18:38.540 --> 18:40.540
Hey, no more
board sliding, okay?

18:40.542 --> 18:42.208
Okay.

18:42.210 --> 18:43.893
All right, man. All right.
See you, Milo.

18:43.895 --> 18:45.812
Thanks.

18:48.065 --> 18:50.350
It felt good, didn't it?

18:50.352 --> 18:51.884
Helping?

18:51.886 --> 18:53.603
Uh, yeah, it did.

18:53.605 --> 18:56.906
A little more
exciting than...?

18:56.908 --> 18:58.491
I mean, wherever
it is you live,

18:58.493 --> 19:01.077
I keep imagining
it's some dark corner

19:01.079 --> 19:03.530
in a place that
everyone's forgotten.

19:03.532 --> 19:05.081
Alex, it's fine, okay?

19:05.083 --> 19:07.283
I've made peace with it.

19:07.285 --> 19:08.618
But do you need to?

19:08.620 --> 19:10.203
I mean, Vince,

19:10.205 --> 19:12.172
look at what you just did.

19:12.174 --> 19:14.707
You were amazing,

19:14.709 --> 19:16.676
just like you
always were.

19:16.678 --> 19:19.212
I guess it comes naturally.

19:19.214 --> 19:21.297
Well, the doctor part, at least.

19:21.299 --> 19:22.915
We need that.

19:22.917 --> 19:24.801
We need <i>you.</i>

19:24.803 --> 19:27.804
Nobody needs to know.

19:27.806 --> 19:29.772
I mean, we're so
off the grid here,

19:29.774 --> 19:32.358
it's not like anyone's
looking over our shoulder.

19:32.360 --> 19:34.444
Don't you want that?

19:34.446 --> 19:37.697
To be <i>that</i> Vincent again?

19:40.367 --> 19:43.069
Miss Salter,
can you come in here, please?

20:05.969 --> 20:08.170
Welcome to Fright Night.

20:08.172 --> 20:10.172
Should have packed
my wooden stakes.

20:10.174 --> 20:11.506
Want me to plug you in
a night-light?

20:11.508 --> 20:14.059
Let's just get this over with.

20:17.297 --> 20:18.730
Oh, yup.

20:18.732 --> 20:20.515
That's a dead guy.

20:20.517 --> 20:23.885
The whole opaque
skin tone thing.

20:23.887 --> 20:25.971
Who was he?

20:25.973 --> 20:27.906
Bike messenger that attacked
a colleague of mine

20:27.908 --> 20:29.224
a few months ago.

20:29.226 --> 20:31.660
I think the creature
intervened.

20:31.662 --> 20:33.662
Sample from the wound

20:33.664 --> 20:35.530
here should confirm it.

20:35.532 --> 20:39.434
Or if there truly is a creature
roaming the city,

20:39.436 --> 20:42.788
is it possible
that it could be cogent?

20:42.790 --> 20:45.323
I mean,
wouldn't it have to have

20:45.325 --> 20:46.925
feelings and emotions

20:46.927 --> 20:48.944
and a sense of justice
and morality

20:48.946 --> 20:50.462
to only be targeting criminals?

20:50.464 --> 20:54.967
Then why do you want
to catch it so badly?

20:54.969 --> 20:58.103
I don't.
I want to understand it.

20:58.105 --> 21:02.224
You want to tag its ear and
follow its migration patterns?

21:02.226 --> 21:04.175
More like question it.

21:04.177 --> 21:05.811
If it had a choice,

21:05.813 --> 21:08.146
would it retain
its evolved abilities, or

21:08.148 --> 21:09.865
would it choose
to be cured?

21:09.867 --> 21:12.618
Cured? Where did that come from?

21:12.620 --> 21:14.002
From your research paper.

21:14.004 --> 21:18.023
So if it did want to be cured,

21:18.025 --> 21:20.525
would you help it?

21:20.527 --> 21:24.362
I can't think of
a more extraordinary challenge.

21:25.832 --> 21:28.967
Would you take this
for me, please?

21:43.350 --> 21:45.884
Freeze, buster.

21:47.900 --> 21:50.936
Am I supposed to put
my hands in the air?

21:50.938 --> 21:53.656
You are not going home.

21:53.658 --> 21:55.625
Well, as tempting

21:55.627 --> 21:58.110
as the lukewarm beer
at O'Farrells is...

21:58.112 --> 21:59.579
So forget O'Farrells.

21:59.581 --> 22:00.913
We'll do something else.

22:00.915 --> 22:02.615
Oh...
But we're celebrating.

22:02.617 --> 22:05.167
And I won't take no
for an answer, Dr. Keller.

22:05.169 --> 22:08.588
Wow, I never thought I'd hear
you call me that again.

22:08.590 --> 22:09.889
It's what you are.

22:09.891 --> 22:11.290
Come on.

22:18.966 --> 22:20.799
I can't believe they still
haven't fixed that door

22:20.801 --> 22:22.485
after all these years.

22:22.487 --> 22:24.937
Maybe we were the only ones
crazy enough to sneak in here.

22:33.363 --> 22:34.780
We shouldn't
be here.

22:34.782 --> 22:36.782
I'm sorry, but aren't
you the same guy

22:36.784 --> 22:38.584
that once climbed
the Unisphere on a dare?

22:38.586 --> 22:41.254
Yeah, well, maybe
I'm older and wiser.

22:41.256 --> 22:42.872
Or maybe you've
just been hiding

22:42.874 --> 22:45.174
the real Vincent Keller
for too long.

22:45.176 --> 22:47.993
What if more has changed
than you realize?

22:48.845 --> 22:51.297
It wouldn't matter.

22:51.299 --> 22:55.101
When I thought
you were dead,

22:55.103 --> 22:58.187
I used to fantasize
about leaving New York

22:58.189 --> 23:00.839
and never coming back.

23:00.841 --> 23:03.809
I read about this
mobile medical team

23:03.811 --> 23:05.945
that works
in remote Nigeria.

23:05.947 --> 23:08.180
They travel from
village to village,

23:08.182 --> 23:11.651
helping whoever
needs medical care.

23:11.653 --> 23:13.286
We could do it, Vince.

23:13.288 --> 23:15.354
We could go together.

23:15.356 --> 23:16.656
No.

23:16.658 --> 23:18.457
Hey...

23:18.459 --> 23:20.409
It doesn't have
to be a fantasy.

23:20.411 --> 23:22.244
The sooner we get
out of here,

23:22.246 --> 23:23.980
the sooner we
can start living.

23:30.538 --> 23:32.088
I wasn't ready.

23:32.090 --> 23:33.339
Ready? Come on.
Oh...

23:33.341 --> 23:35.040
Hold on.
Okay.

23:35.042 --> 23:36.875
Slip on the ice.
Come on.

23:36.877 --> 23:38.043
Hang on!

23:43.850 --> 23:45.651
Whoa.

23:45.653 --> 23:47.687
Whee...

23:47.689 --> 23:49.989
Ah! Oh!

23:49.991 --> 23:52.658
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

23:53.360 --> 23:55.528
Whoa... whoo.

23:55.530 --> 23:56.579
Oh, my God.

23:56.581 --> 23:58.230
I'm gonna fall.

23:58.232 --> 24:01.567
Oh, my God.

24:04.155 --> 24:06.372
Thanks.

24:06.374 --> 24:08.907
My pleasure.

24:11.845 --> 24:13.912
Don't move!

24:20.054 --> 24:22.805
You're telling me
you don't have I.D.?

24:22.807 --> 24:25.891
I just... need to
make a phone call.

24:25.893 --> 24:29.528
Relax, man, I'm not taking
you two in for booking. Yet.

24:29.530 --> 24:30.896
Just holding you.

24:30.898 --> 24:33.699
But I need to be able
to identify you.

24:33.701 --> 24:37.486
Come on, sir, please, just
don't-don't charge me, okay?

24:37.488 --> 24:38.771
It was just a silly
little thing we did.

24:38.773 --> 24:41.490
Not a felony.
Listen to your girlfriend.

24:41.492 --> 24:43.492
This could be very easy--
you give me

24:43.494 --> 24:46.278
your driver's license,
I call it in, we're done.

24:46.280 --> 24:48.831
I just need my phone call.

24:48.833 --> 24:50.449
And I need a name.

24:50.451 --> 24:52.218
Seems we're
at a crossroads here,

24:52.220 --> 24:54.053
and we're not going anywhere
till I know

24:54.055 --> 24:56.222
who you are.

25:08.134 --> 25:10.636
Look, I take back
every bad thing

25:10.638 --> 25:11.970
I've ever said
about Heather.

25:11.972 --> 25:13.806
These dresses she pulled
from work are sick.

25:13.808 --> 25:17.243
Okay, so we talk to Pam
and then we go, right?

25:17.245 --> 25:18.527
What's the rush?

25:18.529 --> 25:20.246
Are my earrings
too slutty?

25:20.248 --> 25:21.480
Too slutty for what?

25:21.482 --> 25:22.948
Good point.

25:22.950 --> 25:24.250
Chandler.

25:24.252 --> 25:26.485
Catherine.
Meet me at the bar.

25:26.487 --> 25:27.870
Vincent?

25:27.872 --> 25:29.488
Look, I need your help, okay?

25:29.490 --> 25:32.258
I think I'm getting arrested.

25:32.260 --> 25:33.826
Okay. Hold on.

25:33.828 --> 25:36.161
Tess.

25:36.163 --> 25:39.098
Oh, no.
You better not bail.

25:39.100 --> 25:41.217
I'm not bailing.
Just a friend in need.

25:41.219 --> 25:43.469
A guy friend?
Why do I even bother?

25:43.471 --> 25:45.170
Get your ass
back here pronto.

25:45.172 --> 25:47.306
Will do.

25:47.308 --> 25:49.942
We've been over this.

25:49.944 --> 25:52.228
You keep stalling me, you're
forcing me to take you in.

25:52.230 --> 25:54.480
You don't understand.
Are you showing off for your girl?

25:54.482 --> 25:56.682
Is that what this is?
No, I just...

25:56.684 --> 25:58.701
It's simple.
I need a name.

25:58.703 --> 26:00.986
Just tell him your name, Vince.
It'll be okay.

26:00.988 --> 26:02.655
Vince. Okay, good.
That's a good start.

26:02.657 --> 26:04.356
Vince what?

26:04.358 --> 26:06.876
I can't tell you.

26:10.381 --> 26:13.198
Okay, you know what, sir? I need
you to get inside the vehicle.

26:13.200 --> 26:16.051
Watch your head.

26:16.053 --> 26:18.888
Hey, what are you doing
with my C.I.?

26:19.806 --> 26:21.707
Who are you?

26:21.709 --> 26:23.008
Narcotics. From the 98th.

26:23.010 --> 26:24.477
Little out of your district,
aren't you?

26:24.479 --> 26:26.211
He was gathering information

26:26.213 --> 26:27.980
for me on a case.
Are you all right?

26:27.982 --> 26:29.265
Yeah, I could be better.

26:29.267 --> 26:31.100
Why didn't you tell me
you were a C.I.?

26:31.102 --> 26:32.485
Why would he tell you?

26:34.738 --> 26:37.823
All right, give me your badge.
I'll run it through.

26:39.776 --> 26:42.244
This look official
enough to you?

26:42.246 --> 26:44.897
Now get on your walkie
and call off the 10-12.

26:44.899 --> 26:46.916
I don't run it through...

26:46.918 --> 26:49.168
you don't get your C.I.

26:49.170 --> 26:51.787
Okay, if you screw up what
I have going on tonight,

26:51.789 --> 26:53.873
I will bring a world
of hurt down on you.

26:53.875 --> 26:55.541
You'll be riding
your time until

26:55.543 --> 26:57.343
retirement giving
parking tickets

26:57.345 --> 26:59.762
to Eurotrash in SoHo.

27:03.183 --> 27:06.585
Relax, sweetheart.
I'm just doing my job.

27:12.209 --> 27:13.926
Just wait.

27:16.696 --> 27:18.647
Okay, I am sorry
for putting you

27:18.649 --> 27:20.366
in this position
and bringing you down here.

27:20.368 --> 27:22.201
What the hell is
going on with you?

27:22.203 --> 27:25.070
I had to lie to
a police officer.

27:25.072 --> 27:26.572
If he had run my badge,
I would've been

27:26.574 --> 27:27.823
kicked off the force.

27:27.825 --> 27:30.326
And you were taped.
Every squad car

27:30.328 --> 27:31.994
has a car-top camera on it.

27:31.996 --> 27:33.913
Now I've got to
cover that up, too.

27:33.915 --> 27:37.082
I know, okay? And I can
understand that you're upset.

27:37.084 --> 27:38.334
I am beyond upset.

27:38.336 --> 27:40.052
I-I am mystified.

27:40.054 --> 27:42.721
Alex makes you do
reckless things

27:42.723 --> 27:45.224
that the rest of us
have to protect you from.

27:45.226 --> 27:47.309
It wasn't her fault, okay?
It was mine.

27:47.311 --> 27:50.012
Well, then you know
that if that cop had booked you,

27:50.014 --> 27:52.264
Muirfield would have been here
before the ink dried.

27:52.266 --> 27:53.799
Don't you think I know that?

27:53.801 --> 27:55.317
Okay, I nearly lost control

27:55.319 --> 27:57.186
thinking about what would happen
if I was taken in.

27:57.188 --> 27:59.572
It's not just you.

27:59.574 --> 28:01.440
You put Alex at risk.

28:01.442 --> 28:06.829
JT. You put <i>me</i> at risk, Vincent.

28:06.831 --> 28:09.531
If you want to figure out if
you can get your old life back,

28:09.533 --> 28:11.483
that's fine.

28:11.485 --> 28:15.304
But it doesn't erase the life
that you have now.

28:15.306 --> 28:17.373
You have to figure
out what you want.

28:17.375 --> 28:20.325
Because...

28:20.327 --> 28:23.796
if you're not gonna
protect yourself,

28:23.798 --> 28:27.266
maybe it's time
that I rethink the risks

28:27.268 --> 28:29.685
that I have taken
to protect you.

28:44.664 --> 28:47.716
Look, I'm sure this is
inappropriate for me to say,

28:47.718 --> 28:50.369
but your boss is H-O-T.

28:50.371 --> 28:53.389
And as hot as he is,
is as kind and generous

28:53.391 --> 28:55.591
as he is.

28:55.593 --> 28:58.060
Sounds like someone
has a crush.

28:58.062 --> 28:59.478
Not anymore.

28:59.480 --> 29:01.013
He's so smooth.

29:01.015 --> 29:03.065
Looks like he's wrapping up
a big deal.

29:03.067 --> 29:06.385
Those suits he's talking
to are with the SEC.

29:06.387 --> 29:09.071
They're discussing
the initial public offering.

29:09.073 --> 29:11.323
Shouldn't you be a part
of that conversation?

29:11.325 --> 29:12.942
You're the chief
financial officer.

29:12.944 --> 29:15.894
Noah likes to take
his high-level meetings alone.

29:15.896 --> 29:17.613
The day
before Lisa Hawkes' death,

29:17.615 --> 29:20.082
Noah was in an all-day meeting
with the SEC.

29:20.084 --> 29:21.450
All day, all night.

29:21.452 --> 29:23.068
Where were you?

29:23.070 --> 29:25.070
I...

29:25.072 --> 29:26.789
Back at the office.

29:26.791 --> 29:28.540
Waiting for his instructions.

29:28.542 --> 29:31.627
The dutiful work wife, right?

29:58.906 --> 30:02.074
You didn't show up for
your session this morning.

30:02.076 --> 30:04.994
Only authorized personnel
are allowed on the firing range.

30:04.996 --> 30:07.496
Well, since you're stretching
that guideline a bit,

30:07.498 --> 30:09.114
why can't I?

30:10.000 --> 30:11.834
I'm sorry about the other day.

30:11.836 --> 30:14.136
I'm not usually so...

30:14.138 --> 30:15.387
Do I get to run with that one?

30:15.389 --> 30:18.257
I'm-I'm not easy.

30:18.259 --> 30:22.645
You can ask...
any of my ex-boyfriends.

30:22.647 --> 30:28.651
My chief, my partner,
my sister, my dad, my...

30:28.653 --> 30:30.635
Oh, no, I'll let you
take that one. Your...?

30:32.072 --> 30:35.491
Let's talk about why
you've been spotted

30:35.493 --> 30:38.977
nosing around a case that you're
not approved to investigate.

30:38.979 --> 30:42.247
Lot of eyes around
the precinct.

30:42.249 --> 30:44.800
So, you take comfort
in your work.

30:44.802 --> 30:46.151
You're good at it.

30:46.153 --> 30:47.536
You have a strong purpose.

30:47.538 --> 30:48.787
You're in control.

30:48.789 --> 30:50.005
Yeah, you caught me.

30:50.007 --> 30:52.324
Seriously,
wh-who doesn't do that?

30:52.326 --> 30:54.159
What's so wrong
if I am committed

30:54.161 --> 30:55.878
to a job that I care about?

30:55.880 --> 30:57.329
Everything.

30:57.331 --> 30:59.264
If you're doing it to escape

30:59.266 --> 31:00.883
dealing with your true feelings.

31:00.885 --> 31:05.003
The only thing I am trying
to escape right now is you.

31:05.005 --> 31:06.355
Catherine, you're clearly

31:06.357 --> 31:08.057
suffering from PTSD

31:08.059 --> 31:10.142
from when Sabrina shot you
and you need to...

31:10.144 --> 31:11.510
Post-traumatic stress?

31:11.512 --> 31:14.279
You want to know
what PTSD is?

31:14.281 --> 31:18.450
It's seeing my mom get gunned
down in front of my eyes.

31:18.452 --> 31:22.488
Watching one of the few
people who really knew

31:22.490 --> 31:25.857
and cared about me leave my life
for reasons I don't understand.

31:25.859 --> 31:27.543
And it is happening again.

31:27.545 --> 31:32.047
Yes. Yes, I have feelings
for the most complicated guy

31:32.049 --> 31:35.834
on the planet, and-and he
doesn't appreciate the risks

31:35.836 --> 31:39.371
that I take every
day to protect him.

31:39.373 --> 31:42.474
He would rather be with someone

31:42.476 --> 31:45.761
who doesn't even
know him anymore.

31:54.720 --> 31:56.905
It's him. It's our creature.

31:56.907 --> 32:00.442
He killed the bike messenger.

32:00.444 --> 32:02.244
Uh, for good reason.

32:02.246 --> 32:04.079
The bike messenger
was a strangler.

32:04.081 --> 32:05.531
Even so,
this is at least six cases

32:05.533 --> 32:07.616
that the creature's
interfered with.

32:07.618 --> 32:09.585
Not that I have proof
of all six, but...

32:09.587 --> 32:11.703
I think this is
enough to go to Joe.

32:11.705 --> 32:14.406
Joe? Who's Joe?
My boss.

32:14.408 --> 32:16.074
Without the samples
that got stolen,

32:16.076 --> 32:18.677
I needed a few new matches
before I could approach him

32:18.679 --> 32:21.346
about forming a task force
to track down this thing.

32:21.348 --> 32:23.849
But... I thought you didn't
want to catch it--

32:23.851 --> 32:26.885
y-you wanted
to understand it, cure it.

32:26.887 --> 32:28.887
I do. Once we've caught it.

32:28.889 --> 32:30.139
JT, look around you.

32:30.141 --> 32:32.775
I work in a
police station.

32:32.777 --> 32:35.861
Good or bad,
this thing kills people.

32:35.863 --> 32:38.013
It's my job
to help uphold the law.

32:38.898 --> 32:40.816
Why do you look so worried?
Your boss.

32:40.818 --> 32:42.985
H-He'll interfere
with our research.

32:42.987 --> 32:45.103
He'll bog us down
with red tape.

32:45.105 --> 32:48.940
More like give us the manpower
that we need to find this thing.

32:58.502 --> 33:00.285
What?

33:00.287 --> 33:04.256
Corrupted? No!
No, you've got to be kidding me.

33:04.258 --> 33:08.793
Maybe there was contamination
in the lab equipment.

33:08.795 --> 33:10.846
That's impossible.
I sterilized everything.

33:10.848 --> 33:13.798
It's not like I can exhume
a buried man twice.

33:24.194 --> 33:25.861
Pardon me, ma'am.

33:25.863 --> 33:28.530
Oh, thank you.

33:31.501 --> 33:34.620
Sorry I'm late.

33:34.622 --> 33:37.005
I hear it's tough
to get a reservation here.

33:38.491 --> 33:40.325
So...

33:40.327 --> 33:42.594
how's it going?

33:42.596 --> 33:44.496
With Evan?
Mm-hmm.

33:44.498 --> 33:46.098
Couldn't be better.

33:50.554 --> 33:52.221
He was getting
a little close to Vincent

33:52.223 --> 33:53.672
for my taste,

33:53.674 --> 33:57.309
but I managed to disrupt
one of his studies.

33:57.311 --> 34:00.112
I snuck into his lab
and I corrupted his samples.

34:00.114 --> 34:02.314
And he doesn't know it was you?

34:02.316 --> 34:04.783
I know how to keep
Evan preoccupied.

34:04.785 --> 34:06.368
Ignorance is bliss, huh?

34:07.654 --> 34:10.539
We'll get to Vincent
before the police.

34:10.541 --> 34:12.123
Then Muirfield will have

34:12.126 --> 34:14.042
everything it needs
to move forward.

34:25.889 --> 34:27.790
We need you to
sign that release

34:27.792 --> 34:29.559
understanding your rights
in regards to questioning.

34:29.561 --> 34:31.978
My heart goes out to you,
Pam.

34:31.980 --> 34:34.179
Being the other woman
can drive a woman crazy.

34:34.181 --> 34:35.364
Don't I know it.

34:35.367 --> 34:37.817
I'm not the other woman.

34:37.819 --> 34:40.370
Uh, did you break up with him?

34:40.371 --> 34:41.838
It was mutual.

34:41.840 --> 34:44.239
See, now, that's not
my understanding.

34:44.242 --> 34:46.141
I spoke to a Ben Williams
at the party.

34:46.143 --> 34:48.161
Cute. Married.

34:48.163 --> 34:49.312
Aren't they all.

34:49.313 --> 34:50.646
He tells me
your relationship with Noah

34:50.648 --> 34:52.449
abruptly ended
after Noah met Lisa.

34:52.451 --> 34:55.051
Said it got a little tense
at the office.

35:04.044 --> 35:06.095
So, you're left-handed.

35:07.465 --> 35:08.882
Yes, I am.

35:08.884 --> 35:10.500
Pam, we know the killer

35:10.502 --> 35:12.786
had a left hand strong enough
to cut that rip cord.

35:12.788 --> 35:15.021
We have CSU searching
for the knife you used

35:15.023 --> 35:16.539
to cut the cord
on the parachute.

35:16.541 --> 35:18.841
First, they're gonna
search your office,

35:18.843 --> 35:20.860
then they're gonna
search your apartment.

35:20.862 --> 35:22.612
And they're very
good, our CSU team.

35:22.614 --> 35:24.347
They'll find it.

35:24.349 --> 35:25.865
Now, if you help us out,

35:25.867 --> 35:28.851
and you let us call off
the scavenger hunt,

35:28.853 --> 35:32.055
we could put in a good word
with the D.A.

35:35.961 --> 35:39.212
He told me he loved me.

35:40.915 --> 35:42.165
That what we had

35:42.167 --> 35:44.067
was special.

35:44.069 --> 35:47.887
Oh... epic.

35:47.889 --> 35:49.422
Oh...

35:49.424 --> 35:51.975
that a love like ours

35:51.977 --> 35:55.645
only came along
once in a lifetime.

35:58.983 --> 36:00.883
I believed him.

36:00.885 --> 36:04.404
Then he met Lisa.

36:04.406 --> 36:07.190
And, uh, his head snapped

36:07.192 --> 36:09.976
in her direction...

36:10.911 --> 36:13.112
...and never snapped back.

36:14.999 --> 36:16.583
And I should've

36:16.585 --> 36:18.785
fought for him then.

36:20.788 --> 36:24.240
But I was stunned.

36:24.242 --> 36:27.093
By the time I composed myself,

36:27.095 --> 36:29.546
they were married.

36:29.548 --> 36:32.465
So you killed her?

36:37.271 --> 36:40.473
Noah's... strong-headed.

36:42.727 --> 36:46.813
He was never gonna
change his mind.

36:46.815 --> 36:49.182
I had ha take action.

36:51.819 --> 36:55.188
She was never gonna know him
the way that I do.

37:07.302 --> 37:09.502
Do I need armor this time?

37:10.672 --> 37:12.505
Sorry, my last apology

37:12.507 --> 37:13.956
didn't come out right.

37:15.959 --> 37:18.428
You're not here
to apologize.

37:18.430 --> 37:22.065
You feel what you feel.

37:23.967 --> 37:26.636
Something tells me
that there's been a lot

37:26.638 --> 37:28.971
that you have felt that

37:28.973 --> 37:31.807
you needed to apologize for.

37:31.809 --> 37:33.259
Your anger towards your mom,

37:33.261 --> 37:35.144
your feelings for guys

37:35.146 --> 37:36.812
who don't deserve
you, apparently.

37:36.814 --> 37:38.481
And now you've

37:38.483 --> 37:41.284
put your heart out there again
after you've kept it

37:41.286 --> 37:44.921
locked up for so long,
and this lug nut

37:44.923 --> 37:47.540
can't see how unique
your connection is

37:47.542 --> 37:49.459
if he's tempted to fall
back into a relationship

37:49.461 --> 37:50.944
that's safe and familiar,

37:50.946 --> 37:53.463
but not really
what he needs, or...

37:53.465 --> 37:55.348
not really what he wants.

37:55.350 --> 37:56.466
Wow, that was...

37:56.468 --> 37:57.634
that was oddly good.

37:57.636 --> 37:58.834
Well,

37:58.836 --> 38:00.219
you're not the only one

38:00.221 --> 38:01.871
whose life isn't perfect.

38:01.873 --> 38:04.407
Relationships are, um...

38:04.409 --> 38:07.393
uh, they're a pain
in the ass.

38:07.395 --> 38:09.062
Yeah, you can't make
someone love you.

38:09.064 --> 38:10.647
But...

38:10.649 --> 38:14.033
you can stop trying
to escape getting hurt

38:14.035 --> 38:17.904
by throwing all of your energy
into protecting people.

38:17.906 --> 38:19.706
Take a chance.

38:20.574 --> 38:22.992
Have you told him

38:22.994 --> 38:25.078
exactly how you feel?

38:25.080 --> 38:27.246
Exactly what you want?

38:27.248 --> 38:29.699
I don't know, I...

38:29.701 --> 38:33.086
think it's pretty obvious.

38:33.088 --> 38:35.304
You can't even say it to me.

38:45.265 --> 38:48.451
I love him.

39:01.950 --> 39:03.416
Hey.

39:03.418 --> 39:04.951
Hi.

39:04.953 --> 39:06.753
I pulled some strings,

39:06.755 --> 39:10.239
and I got the recording
from the police car.

39:10.241 --> 39:11.874
Last time I cover for you.

39:11.876 --> 39:14.243
Thank you.
Yeah.

39:17.264 --> 39:18.848
Catherine, I am so...

39:18.850 --> 39:20.883
No, you... you don't
have to say anything.

39:20.885 --> 39:22.502
No. Please, let me.

39:24.288 --> 39:28.207
You risked your job for me.

39:28.209 --> 39:30.426
And Alex.

39:32.362 --> 39:35.931
And even if I was
gonna be with her,

39:35.933 --> 39:37.734
you were willing to protect me

39:37.736 --> 39:39.452
unconditionally, and no one...

39:39.454 --> 39:40.653
Okay, I-I...

39:40.655 --> 39:44.323
I wasn't honest with you.

39:44.325 --> 39:46.359
When?

39:52.250 --> 39:56.586
I can't compete with the life
you had with Alex.

39:56.588 --> 39:59.288
But...

39:59.290 --> 40:01.674
I don't want to
give up on us

40:01.676 --> 40:03.893
before we've even begun.

40:08.148 --> 40:11.517
I want to be with you, Vincent.

40:12.853 --> 40:14.837
And I'm willing

40:14.839 --> 40:16.972
to fight for you.

40:16.974 --> 40:19.358
I...
I...

40:19.360 --> 40:21.744
I don't know
if my choice is...

40:21.746 --> 40:23.529
so clear.

40:25.199 --> 40:29.152
I need to be honest
with you.

40:31.321 --> 40:34.207
I really miss who I used to be.

40:34.209 --> 40:36.425
You know, Vinnie Keller,
the doctor,

40:36.427 --> 40:38.661
the normal guy.

40:38.663 --> 40:41.914
And I think,
I really think,

40:41.916 --> 40:44.200
I can be that person again.

40:46.002 --> 40:48.671
And with me...

40:48.673 --> 40:51.324
you'd always be, what?

40:51.326 --> 40:54.427
Not normal?

40:55.462 --> 40:58.247
Alex is willing
to give her life up

40:58.249 --> 40:59.949
to go with me.

40:59.951 --> 41:03.236
And not here, just...

41:03.238 --> 41:05.905
away somewhere from

41:05.907 --> 41:07.573
all of this so I can be free,

41:07.575 --> 41:09.242
you know, from...

41:09.244 --> 41:11.761
from Muirfield.

41:21.688 --> 41:23.539
Would you?

41:25.893 --> 41:28.594
Would she?

41:28.596 --> 41:30.980
If she knew the truth?

41:38.889 --> 41:42.241
Vincent, you haven't told her.

41:44.444 --> 41:48.781
And until you do,
isn't all of this

41:48.783 --> 41:52.251
just a fantasy?
