WEBVTT

00:45.545 --> 00:47.379
I can see you.

00:50.175 --> 00:52.342
...pull into this gas station,
the guy was like,

00:52.427 --> 00:53.844
"Yo, man, you got problems."

00:53.928 --> 00:56.680
Like, "What the hell do you think
I pulled in here for?"

00:56.765 --> 01:01.018
So your car broke down
on the way to your blood check.

01:01.102 --> 01:03.520
Yeah, smoke, everything.

01:04.063 --> 01:08.692
I'm willing to give you the benefit
of the doubt, Javier, but a judge won't.

01:08.860 --> 01:12.071
I missed a couple of meetings?
What's the problem?

01:12.697 --> 01:14.031
I mean,
I don't even know what I'm doing here.

01:14.115 --> 01:17.201
You're here because your son has
gotten into fights every day at school,

01:17.285 --> 01:20.245
and the last one sent one of his
classmates to the hospital.

01:20.330 --> 01:22.039
Juanita came here for help voluntarily

01:22.123 --> 01:24.583
before the court stepped in
and made it mandatory,

01:24.667 --> 01:27.044
that's what you're doing here.

01:27.128 --> 01:29.379
He's on a dangerous road.

01:29.464 --> 01:33.300
Your history, all the violence,
all the anger,

01:33.384 --> 01:36.470
that's his future
unless you break the cycle.

01:37.055 --> 01:39.139
- I heard you, Mrs Lynch.
- You're trying to steal my boy!

01:39.224 --> 01:41.558
No one is trying to steal your child.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.644
- Then what are you trying...
- They found bruises

01:43.728 --> 01:45.270
- and cigarette burns...
- I told you,

01:45.355 --> 01:47.231
he was playing with some sparklers.

01:47.315 --> 01:49.066
Mrs Lynch, I read the medical report.

01:49.150 --> 01:51.068
I wanna talk to my own doctor.
I want a lawyer.

01:51.152 --> 01:53.070
If you feel
that you need legal representation

01:53.154 --> 01:54.863
- that's perfectly within your rights...
- I don't need your help, in no case.

01:55.406 --> 01:59.118
- You've already interfered enough.
- You... Hello?

02:02.539 --> 02:05.582
- How many active cases you got?
- Thirty? -eight.

02:05.917 --> 02:09.961
- Okay.
- Wayne, come on!

02:10.045 --> 02:13.507
- Look, I'm buried here.
- I'm sorry, Em, we all are.

04:12.335 --> 04:15.420
- You have three new voice messages.
- Hi.

04:16.089 --> 04:20.175
Hey, it's Suze, missed you at yoga
the other day, give me a call.

04:20.385 --> 04:23.804
Hey, Em, it's Jackie. Just checking in,
hope you're good.

04:24.806 --> 04:28.475
Exhausted,
her career path questionable,

04:28.559 --> 04:31.103
her faith in mankind shaken,

04:31.187 --> 04:33.230
she resisted her tendency
toward introspection

04:33.314 --> 04:37.025
and decides to go have a drink
with her charming friend Doug.

04:38.361 --> 04:41.071
- I am so in your head.
- Be honest.

04:41.155 --> 04:44.700
The whole psychology thing,
it's just about scoring chicks, isn't it?

04:44.784 --> 04:47.494
Regrettably, yes. Two.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.956
Well, what are we gonna
drink to tonight?

04:51.040 --> 04:53.000
The never-ending fun
of a career in public service?

04:53.084 --> 04:54.209
Yeah.

04:55.169 --> 04:58.588
You know,
I sit there talking to these families,

04:58.673 --> 05:00.424
the authority on everything.

05:00.508 --> 05:05.095
And I have these moments
where I think I might be totally full of it.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.514
Everybody's full of it.

05:07.890 --> 05:11.601
In the end you're a number to call
for people who don't have anyone else.

05:11.686 --> 05:13.687
There's no way that's bad.

05:15.690 --> 05:20.861
Anyway, I've done some soul searching

05:21.529 --> 05:23.280
and I just want to say

05:23.364 --> 05:26.616
that if a full-on relationship
feels like too much right now,

05:26.701 --> 05:29.911
I'd be willing to consider
a purely physical one.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.333
- What?
- Nothing.

05:35.043 --> 05:39.463
- What, you might actually enjoy yourself.
- Yeah, yeah, I probably would.

05:39.630 --> 05:44.468
- It's just...
- I know, I know, the job,

05:44.802 --> 05:47.971
you get home, no time for anybody else.
Whatever.

05:48.056 --> 05:50.432
Listen, I'm giving you a month. Okay?
One month.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.976
- And then?
- I don't know.

05:53.102 --> 05:55.854
Probably give you another month,
but that is it.

05:55.938 --> 05:58.815
Except for two more, then, it's over.

06:07.617 --> 06:09.701
If it were anyone...

06:28.513 --> 06:30.639
What are they doing to you?

07:27.572 --> 07:31.408
- What?
- Emily Jenkins. Child Services?

07:31.492 --> 07:33.076
We spoke on the phone?

07:33.161 --> 07:36.246
- You said the 17th.
- It's the 17th.

07:36.330 --> 07:39.416
- Is not.
- I'm sorry, but it is.

07:41.794 --> 07:45.255
Monday the 17th.
The day of our appointment.

08:13.284 --> 08:14.326
Hi.

08:16.454 --> 08:18.788
Come down, I'd like to meet you.

08:33.596 --> 08:36.139
My name's Emily. What's yours?

08:38.476 --> 08:41.311
- Lily.
- That's a pretty name.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.358
Is there somewhere we can talk?

08:47.818 --> 08:51.029
So, when are you
expecting your husband back?

08:52.823 --> 08:56.993
Because we've found that it's better
when the whole family participates.

08:57.828 --> 08:59.913
Well, he's not here, so...

08:59.997 --> 09:01.831
Do you have some way
of contacting him?

09:01.958 --> 09:04.292
Not if I don't know where he is.

09:05.878 --> 09:07.671
Is that...

09:09.215 --> 09:12.133
Would you mind asking him
to join us, please?

09:12.218 --> 09:16.179
- He doesn't have anything to say.
- Will you ask him, please?

09:23.187 --> 09:24.437
Edward.

09:24.522 --> 09:27.357
That lady is here from the state.
She wants to talk to you.

09:27.483 --> 09:29.651
I don't have anything to say, tell her that!

09:29.735 --> 09:32.487
I told her already, she wants to anyway.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.742
It'll be okay.

09:47.878 --> 09:50.714
Hi, I'm Emily.

09:54.176 --> 09:55.218
Okay.

09:56.012 --> 09:58.638
I'm here because we received a call

09:58.723 --> 10:02.017
that Lilith
is showing serious signs of neglect.

10:02.852 --> 10:07.355
Now at this point we can only assume
it's the result of family problems.

10:21.203 --> 10:23.913
Eddie says
we don't have family problems.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.791
Well, many families won't realise
that they're having problems

10:26.876 --> 10:29.919
until it's too late.
And that's where we come in.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.880
We help families communicate

10:31.964 --> 10:35.216
and learn healthier ways
of resolving conflict.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.976
Eddie says we don't need your help.

10:45.936 --> 10:50.106
Mr Sullivan, is there a reason
why you won't speak to me directly?

10:53.569 --> 10:57.447
Is there a reason why your husband
won't speak to me directly?

11:04.789 --> 11:07.582
Eddie doesn't like speaking out of anger.

11:24.975 --> 11:26.726
There's no laws
against being weird, Em.

11:26.811 --> 11:28.937
I didn't say weird, I said scary.

11:29.021 --> 11:31.564
That man sat there
staring at me the whole time,

11:31.649 --> 11:34.317
and the mother is his emotional slave.

11:34.443 --> 11:37.028
Wait, you didn't just fly to New York
and meet with my parents, did you?

11:37.113 --> 11:38.738
Wayne?

11:38.823 --> 11:41.658
All right. All right.
Are there any cuts, any bruises,

11:41.784 --> 11:43.326
any signs she's being abused?

11:43.452 --> 11:47.205
No, not physically.
But this girl's in trouble, I can feel it.

11:47.289 --> 11:48.665
You wanna know what I can feel?

11:48.791 --> 11:51.292
The lawsuit we're gonna get hit with
if we violate her parents' rights

11:51.377 --> 11:53.545
without any evidence
they've done something wrong.

11:53.629 --> 11:56.297
All right, Wayne.
You put these files on my desk

11:56.382 --> 11:58.049
and you ask me to tell you
what's going on.

11:58.134 --> 12:01.970
I've told you, I've done my job,
what you do with it is yours.

12:22.491 --> 12:25.702
We're not perfect parents,
we know that,

12:25.828 --> 12:27.537
but we figure if they know
how much you love them

12:27.663 --> 12:30.707
a lot of the other stuff
takes care of itself.

12:35.546 --> 12:38.006
She knows how we feel about her.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.384
So, tell me, Mr Sullivan,

12:41.510 --> 12:44.554
since you've suddenly acquired
the ability to speak,

12:44.680 --> 12:46.139
doesn't it concern you a little

12:46.223 --> 12:49.893
that Lily's grades have dropped
from A's to D's in three months?

12:50.019 --> 12:52.353
Of course it does, she's our daughter.

12:52.438 --> 12:56.232
So you have no idea why your daughter
falls asleep in class every day?

12:56.358 --> 12:58.943
Why she can't sleep at home? No idea?

13:02.072 --> 13:04.574
Bad dreams maybe?

13:06.702 --> 13:09.746
Don't tell me you're buying
this whole "daddy's little girl" routine?

13:09.872 --> 13:12.207
Look, they're not my favourite people
either, okay?

13:12.333 --> 13:15.126
But we can't guarantee every kid
a happy childhood. I wish we could.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.587
Let me talk to her.
She wants to talk. Alone.

13:17.713 --> 13:21.257
- Em, we do not have a case.
- Just five minutes, okay?

13:21.383 --> 13:24.219
Talk to them
about how much they love kids.

13:33.020 --> 13:35.063
Hey, girls, slow down!

13:37.107 --> 13:40.360
I used to wish I had a sister
when I was growing up.

13:40.444 --> 13:41.986
To play with and to talk to

13:42.071 --> 13:45.907
about all those things that you
just can't tell anybody else, you know?

13:46.033 --> 13:49.035
Did you ever wish that?
That you had a sister?

14:01.131 --> 14:04.133
Well, that was a silly thing to do,
wasn't it?

14:06.595 --> 14:08.763
What's happening with you?

14:14.937 --> 14:18.314
You know I can help. Let me help you.

14:20.276 --> 14:22.235
What is it, sweetheart?

14:26.448 --> 14:27.949
They hate me.

14:28.784 --> 14:31.160
I'm sure they don't hate you.

14:31.620 --> 14:34.289
They do. I hear them.

14:36.625 --> 14:41.129
They go into the cellar and talk.

14:42.131 --> 14:44.132
What do they talk about?

14:48.470 --> 14:50.346
Sending me to hell.

14:52.349 --> 14:54.517
You heard them say that?

15:00.774 --> 15:04.611
You can tell him. He's on your side.
It's okay.

15:08.157 --> 15:11.993
Lily, did you hear your parents say
they were gonna hurt you?

15:58.666 --> 16:03.044
I was just thinking about you,
got a nice letter from Sandy Hutchinson.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.257
Well, well, well.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.969
It's sitting right in front of me,
which means our good friend Wayne

16:11.053 --> 16:14.180
has decided it fails to meet the criteria
for child endangerment

16:14.264 --> 16:16.975
and has told you in no uncertain terms
to leave it alone.

16:17.059 --> 16:20.269
- Surprise, surprise.
- I'm sorry, Emily. I can't.

16:20.396 --> 16:23.106
Please, Mike, I'm really desperate here.

16:31.031 --> 16:32.281
Emily.

16:34.410 --> 16:37.453
Now, you know how dear to my heart
the work you do is,

16:37.579 --> 16:41.290
but the department doesn't pay me
to stake out potential child abusers.

16:41.417 --> 16:43.459
Last time almost cost me my job.

16:43.585 --> 16:48.214
This little girl heard her parents say
they're going to send her to hell.

16:48.924 --> 16:50.758
Sickening as that is,

16:51.719 --> 16:54.971
you're a part of the system that
deals with those situations, I'm not.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.306
But sometimes the system doesn't work.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.809
Well, maybe you should just let it.

16:59.935 --> 17:02.770
Wow. Feel like
I'm talking to Wayne here.

17:03.772 --> 17:06.273
All right. You don't want to get involved,
that's fine,

17:06.400 --> 17:09.359
but don't bullshit me, Mike,
I'm running out of people I respect.

17:09.444 --> 17:14.198
Okay. No bullshit. Bring me evidence
of a crime, I'm all over it. Till then...

17:45.314 --> 17:47.315
Let's go, hurry up!

17:47.441 --> 17:49.525
Lily! Lily!

17:54.406 --> 17:59.160
Hi. I came to tell you
I hadn't forgotten about you.

18:00.245 --> 18:02.246
I'm doing everything I can.

18:04.917 --> 18:08.461
If I disappear will you come look for me?

18:09.922 --> 18:13.299
- You're not going to disappear.
- Lf I do?

18:16.678 --> 18:20.807
I have to go. They get mad at me
when I miss the bus.

18:22.851 --> 18:25.686
Lily, wait. Wait.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.859
Here. It's my home number.

18:34.279 --> 18:37.824
If you get scared,
I want you to call me, okay?

18:39.118 --> 18:41.953
I'm gonna get you out of there,
I promise.

18:43.872 --> 18:45.039
Okay.

19:03.016 --> 19:05.977
Hey, this is Doug, here it comes.

19:07.020 --> 19:11.190
Hey, it's me,
thought you might be awake.

19:12.317 --> 19:14.652
Just calling 'cause...

19:15.821 --> 19:18.656
Well, I don't really know why I'm calling.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.742
Call me if you get this, okay?

19:21.827 --> 19:25.246
...proposal in Morton Township
has some residents...

19:25.581 --> 19:27.582
Here we go golfers and shoppers...

19:28.167 --> 19:31.169
Let's look at the crepe batter.
In order to make the crepe batter...

19:38.177 --> 19:41.095
- Too late, I met someone else.
- Emily.

19:42.931 --> 19:46.100
Lily? Are you okay?

19:46.518 --> 19:49.896
- I'm scared.
- Why, honey? Why are you scared?

19:50.189 --> 19:54.108
They're waiting to get me,
I can hear them.

19:54.568 --> 19:57.028
- I'm sorry.
- Why are you sorry?

19:58.614 --> 20:00.698
- I'm falling asleep.
- Okay, listen.

20:00.782 --> 20:03.701
Go over and open the window.
Can you do that?

20:03.785 --> 20:07.288
- I'm sorry.
- Lily? Lily?

20:58.757 --> 21:00.841
- Yeah, Barron.
- Mike, it's Emily.

21:00.926 --> 21:03.261
That girl that I told you about,
I think she's in a lot of trouble.

21:03.345 --> 21:05.680
- Emily, you're going...
- No, I know what you said.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.974
Mike, you're not listening! Help me!

22:05.240 --> 22:07.908
- What are we doing here, Emily?
- Saving her life!

22:08.035 --> 22:11.078
- They're asleep like we should be.
- They're not asleep.

22:11.204 --> 22:14.081
- Did you hear that?
- I didn't hear anything.

22:15.250 --> 22:16.584
Leave her alone!

22:17.753 --> 22:18.919
No!

22:22.549 --> 22:24.008
Let me out!

22:27.929 --> 22:30.514
- Did you hear that?
- Police, open up!

22:32.517 --> 22:33.768
Stop!

22:36.938 --> 22:39.273
Break, break it down. Break it down!

22:57.584 --> 23:00.044
Help me. Help me.

23:02.964 --> 23:04.799
- Police!
- Lily!

23:12.140 --> 23:13.391
Lily!

23:15.936 --> 23:18.479
God! Oh, my God!

23:18.647 --> 23:20.981
No! Help me!

23:23.735 --> 23:25.319
Please, help me.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.660
I got you, I got you, I got...

23:59.062 --> 24:00.396
Okay. I got you.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.857
What the hell's the matter
with you people?

24:02.941 --> 24:04.358
I got you.

24:09.239 --> 24:12.867
It's okay, honey. I got you.

24:13.869 --> 24:15.911
It's okay. I got you.

24:19.499 --> 24:21.292
The egregiousness of the crime makes

24:21.376 --> 24:24.211
the competency question
all the more relevant.

24:24.296 --> 24:28.174
I hereby order the defendants to
undergo psychiatric evaluation

24:28.258 --> 24:30.968
to determine their fitness for trial.

24:32.053 --> 24:33.804
Steal a pizza, San Quentin.

24:33.889 --> 24:36.348
Try to kill your kid,
Freudian dream analysis.

24:36.433 --> 24:39.101
You're gonna hate me for saying this
but my money's on crazy.

24:39.186 --> 24:40.978
What kind of people
put their kid in an oven?

24:41.062 --> 24:43.939
Bad people. Remember that
when people were just bad?

24:44.024 --> 24:47.443
Before everything had a diagnosis
and a justification?

24:47.527 --> 24:49.069
It's human nature.

24:56.119 --> 24:57.369
What's the most important thing

24:57.454 --> 25:00.372
that we talked about
that you have to remember?

25:02.626 --> 25:04.877
It's not my fault what happened.

25:04.961 --> 25:08.422
That's right. You know what? It's not.

25:12.886 --> 25:15.095
Good. I'll see you soon.

25:16.806 --> 25:18.766
- Hey.
- Hi.

25:18.850 --> 25:22.937
That is some seriously proactive
social work happening there.

25:23.939 --> 25:25.814
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

25:25.899 --> 25:28.067
- How's she doing?
- Typical reaction.

25:29.569 --> 25:32.571
But she blames herself. We'll get there.

25:34.449 --> 25:37.826
I'm gonna put her in a group setting,
see if I can get her to open up.

25:37.911 --> 25:42.081
Group therapy for kids,
when am I going to get used to that?

25:43.083 --> 25:45.000
- See you later. Okay.
- See you.

25:45.835 --> 25:47.086
Hi.

25:51.132 --> 25:54.718
Good news. They say you can
get out of here tomorrow.

25:56.179 --> 25:59.223
Doug said I might have to go
to a state home.

25:59.766 --> 26:04.937
Yeah, but it's only temporary,
till we find you a nice family.

26:07.190 --> 26:09.191
Why can't I live with you?

26:09.943 --> 26:12.528
Sweetheart, that would
never be allowed.

26:12.612 --> 26:13.904
Why?

26:15.240 --> 26:18.450
Well, it's complicated, I mean,
there's this whole process,

26:18.535 --> 26:21.662
and I'm not even a foster parent. So...

26:25.709 --> 26:27.376
It'll be fine.

26:37.721 --> 26:41.015
- Hi, Barb.
- Hi, Em. Right this way, little lady.

26:44.853 --> 26:47.646
I'll check in, in a couple of days, okay?

26:52.110 --> 26:56.030
I don't want to stay here,
I want to live with you.

26:57.907 --> 27:01.035
Please. I'll be good.

27:01.745 --> 27:04.288
Lily, it's impossible, I told you.

27:07.584 --> 27:09.501
Will you try?

27:10.587 --> 27:15.549
Honey, listen, even if they said yes,
it would never work.

27:15.842 --> 27:19.386
I work all day and
I'm hardly ever home and...

27:20.555 --> 27:25.100
I'm sorry, I'm just not mom material.

27:26.394 --> 27:29.063
How do you know if you've never tried?

27:46.873 --> 27:48.791
So, it's just until we can find
the right family for her,

27:48.875 --> 27:51.126
just until we can place her
in a really good home.

27:51.211 --> 27:54.963
You know you'd have to give up
the case, conflict of interests and all.

27:55.048 --> 27:56.465
Yeah.

27:56.758 --> 28:01.303
Can I ask you a question?
Why are you doing this?

28:01.971 --> 28:05.432
What Lily needs right now is
a safe, supportive environment

28:05.517 --> 28:07.309
with someone she trusts.

28:07.394 --> 28:10.688
The system can't provide that for her,
I think that I can.

28:10.772 --> 28:13.607
Better than anyone, given my training.

28:13.692 --> 28:16.610
We spend so much of our time
negotiating red tape,

28:16.695 --> 28:20.906
I think if we look at this situation,
this one situation,

28:20.990 --> 28:24.993
this one child,
it's clear what's best for her.

28:29.332 --> 28:33.085
How long till Foster Services can
place her in a permanent home?

28:33.169 --> 28:36.588
Three weeks, three months,
it's hard to predict.

28:49.686 --> 28:51.478
No more visits.

28:52.856 --> 28:55.023
- What?
- They said yes.

28:59.237 --> 29:01.363
It's your new beginning.

29:03.825 --> 29:09.163
Okay. It's what I like to think of as
a glass-half-full situation.

29:11.249 --> 29:14.293
Bathroom. Kitchen. Fish.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.796
And this is your room.

29:21.468 --> 29:23.135
Be okay?

29:31.686 --> 29:34.271
- You live alone?
- Just me.

29:35.607 --> 29:36.940
Just us.

29:42.947 --> 29:45.824
- What's this?
- It's chamomile.

29:45.909 --> 29:47.493
Helps me sleep.

29:52.040 --> 29:55.334
You know none of this
should ever have happened.

29:55.418 --> 29:57.711
If I could make it go away, I would.

29:59.088 --> 30:00.380
You did.

30:06.471 --> 30:10.516
Here. Climb in.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.397
Night night.

30:54.811 --> 30:56.854
- Okay. All right.
- Here we go.

30:56.938 --> 31:00.399
- Just got to grab some of her things.
- Okay.

31:00.483 --> 31:03.527
- So, here's the key.
- You're not coming?

31:03.653 --> 31:05.696
I got 15 other places I got to be.

31:05.780 --> 31:09.324
So make sure you lock it on the way out.
Okay? Bye.

33:36.556 --> 33:41.018
The kids at school are
saying all this stuff like saying

33:41.894 --> 33:44.104
my mother is a puta

33:44.897 --> 33:49.192
and I mean, I know
we can't go back home

33:51.154 --> 33:52.696
but I miss it.

33:54.323 --> 33:56.324
Sometimes when our parents
aren't getting along,

33:56.409 --> 33:59.161
it's better if they spend some time apart.

33:59.245 --> 34:02.039
That's what a restraining order does.

34:02.498 --> 34:04.166
She's starting to come out of her shell.

34:04.250 --> 34:06.501
It's good,
but you got to expect some hiccups.

34:06.586 --> 34:08.962
And you can't undo
10 years of trauma in six weeks.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.505
School? Too soon?

34:10.590 --> 34:12.591
No, I don't have a problem
with her going back,

34:12.675 --> 34:15.761
just as long as she's comfortable with it.

34:17.388 --> 34:20.389
I went by the house.
I think her mom and dad were

34:20.475 --> 34:22.641
barricading themselves
in their room at night.

34:22.726 --> 34:24.186
How sick is that?

34:24.270 --> 34:26.353
Well, fear and hatred are
part of the same pathology.

34:26.438 --> 34:28.190
- See you. Bye, Diego.
- You too, Lily.

34:28.274 --> 34:29.900
- But I forgot.
- Bye.

34:29.984 --> 34:32.152
- Bye.
- You don't think they're crazy.

34:32.235 --> 34:34.362
Well, I'm coming around.

34:40.453 --> 34:43.455
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

34:50.379 --> 34:52.547
- Wayne's looking for you.
- Okay.

34:55.885 --> 34:58.929
- Wayne wants to see you.
- Yeah, I got it.

35:06.395 --> 35:08.396
What's up with Diego?

35:08.523 --> 35:12.818
Oh, hey.
Look, why don't we go talk in my office.

35:12.902 --> 35:15.195
No, tell me what's going on.

35:16.614 --> 35:22.953
Well, we don't... We don't know why yet
but he killed both his parents last night.

35:29.460 --> 35:32.546
- Excuse me... Go ahead.
- Officer, let her through.

35:36.050 --> 35:37.175
What happened?

35:37.260 --> 35:40.595
Gets a tyre iron from the garage,
comes back inside,

35:44.225 --> 35:48.436
locks all the doors and windows,
and kills them in their sleep.

35:54.569 --> 35:57.112
"Slaughters" would be a better word.

36:03.327 --> 36:04.995
Oh, my God!

36:20.970 --> 36:24.097
A 10-year-old did this? There's no way.

36:24.182 --> 36:27.601
I was there when they brought him in.
Took three guys to subdue him.

36:27.685 --> 36:29.811
And the kid was climbing the walls.

36:31.355 --> 36:33.148
Man's best friend, huh?

36:52.543 --> 36:55.253
What happened?
Tell me what happened.

36:55.338 --> 36:57.380
I killed my mom and dad.

37:05.514 --> 37:07.599
Every family you sit down with,

37:07.683 --> 37:11.019
every day of every week,
it's a family in crisis.

37:11.395 --> 37:15.482
Those are your odds. Well,
that's yourjob, trying to beat them.

37:20.488 --> 37:22.322
You're one person, Em.

37:23.032 --> 37:25.158
You can't save the world.

37:29.372 --> 37:31.581
I know somebody you did save.

37:35.169 --> 37:36.253
Yeah.

37:39.173 --> 37:42.008
- You okay?
- Yeah.

37:42.593 --> 37:44.844
It's just work. Don't worry.

37:46.514 --> 37:49.849
- I think you have a hard job.
- So do I.

37:51.852 --> 37:55.230
People have kids and then they decide
they don't want to be parents.

37:55.356 --> 37:59.067
And then the kids grow up
thinking it's their fault.

38:00.778 --> 38:03.029
Is that what your parents did?

38:04.615 --> 38:06.616
You said you were alone.

38:08.536 --> 38:09.619
Yeah.

38:11.706 --> 38:13.748
I never met my dad.

38:15.042 --> 38:18.753
And my mom... My mom had problems.

38:19.088 --> 38:22.382
- She must have scared you.
- Why do you say that?

38:23.259 --> 38:25.927
You don't like to talk about it.

38:28.597 --> 38:30.765
You're a clever little girl.

38:42.611 --> 38:45.613
Sweetheart. Breakfast.

38:48.284 --> 38:49.743
What you got?

38:58.961 --> 39:00.503
Let me see.

39:07.636 --> 39:09.804
You went through my things?

39:11.599 --> 39:15.977
I'm sorry. I wanted to know about you.

39:24.445 --> 39:26.488
Is that your mother?

39:29.283 --> 39:31.117
What happened to her?

39:32.620 --> 39:35.830
She died when I was about your age.

39:37.875 --> 39:40.794
- How?
- An accident.

39:47.134 --> 39:50.845
It was raining
and she was driving too fast.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.183
We had an accident.

39:58.312 --> 40:00.146
Are you mad at me?

40:02.525 --> 40:04.401
No, I'm not mad at you.

40:05.319 --> 40:07.362
But I need you
not to do that again, okay?

40:07.488 --> 40:10.323
Go through my private things
without asking.

40:11.534 --> 40:14.160
Okay? All right.

40:15.579 --> 40:18.164
Omelette's getting cold. Better hurry.

40:33.180 --> 40:37.183
You watch, six months,
their lawyer will hire an expert

40:37.268 --> 40:40.937
to say they're rehabbed and they'll sue
for custody when they get out.

40:41.021 --> 40:42.647
She's not going back there.

40:42.731 --> 40:45.567
I'll take her out of the state
before I let them near her again.

40:45.693 --> 40:47.694
Didn't hear you say that.

40:49.405 --> 40:50.905
You guys okay?

40:53.033 --> 40:57.412
We're great. She's sweet,
very intuitive about everything.

41:01.917 --> 41:04.419
You wanted to talk about something?

41:04.879 --> 41:07.046
We pulled the Ramirezes'
phone records.

41:07.173 --> 41:09.507
There was a call that night
before the murder.

41:09.592 --> 41:12.760
- From who?
- The call came from your house, Emily.

41:13.596 --> 41:14.721
What?

41:15.097 --> 41:17.974
I'm not accusing you of anything,
I just want to know what was said.

41:18.058 --> 41:19.893
But that's impossible.

41:20.019 --> 41:22.353
I mean, I might have called them
the week before or something, but I...

41:22.438 --> 41:25.607
I'm talking to you as a friend,
you know that, right?

41:25.733 --> 41:27.775
Mike, did you not hear me?

41:27.902 --> 41:31.613
As a friend, I'm telling you
that I didn't call that family.

41:36.285 --> 41:42.290
He's in my group.
Why, did something happen?

41:45.085 --> 41:47.212
We're trying to figure out why.

41:47.296 --> 41:50.298
Diego got a call from here,
last Thursday night.

41:50.424 --> 41:52.467
I'm just wondering
if he might have said something.

41:52.593 --> 41:55.220
- That wasn't me.
- You didn't call him?

41:56.972 --> 42:00.642
Lily, it's difficult sometimes
to tell the truth,

42:00.768 --> 42:03.019
but I know you will
because you're a good kid.

42:03.103 --> 42:04.979
I am telling the truth.

42:05.814 --> 42:09.317
My backup files are in the cabinet.
Diego's is in there.

42:09.818 --> 42:14.656
Maybe you got curious and went
through some, dialled a number?

42:14.782 --> 42:17.242
It wasn't me, I swear.

42:17.952 --> 42:21.746
The call came at 2:00 a.m.
You ever up that late?

42:21.830 --> 42:24.666
- I didn't call him.
- You ever up that late?

42:24.792 --> 42:27.835
Mike, she said no.
Maybe somebody made a mistake.

42:29.255 --> 42:30.797
Yeah, maybe so.

42:37.596 --> 42:41.641
Why would Diego do this?
He loved his mom and dad.

42:43.269 --> 42:46.854
You never want to think anyone you
know is capable of that kind of thing.

42:46.981 --> 42:50.650
In your mind, it's always some
nameless, faceless creature.

42:52.319 --> 42:55.113
Sometimes, the city seems full of them.

42:55.823 --> 42:58.783
But they're just people,
like you and me.

43:01.662 --> 43:02.996
She's lying.

43:09.628 --> 43:11.337
Do you believe me?

43:12.673 --> 43:14.173
I believe you.

43:18.387 --> 43:22.223
I need to ask you something
about the night it happened.

43:22.349 --> 43:25.351
Did you get a call? Really late?

43:28.856 --> 43:30.315
You didn't.

43:32.067 --> 43:34.193
Diego, I know that you did.

43:36.322 --> 43:38.489
The call came from my house.

43:42.995 --> 43:44.704
What's the matter?

43:45.539 --> 43:48.082
What's scaring you? Diego.

43:49.752 --> 43:53.171
It's okay, it's all right. Deep breaths,
deep breaths, you'll be all right.

43:53.255 --> 43:55.882
Can we get some help in here, please?

44:09.605 --> 44:13.191
Who called you? Was it Lily?

44:16.403 --> 44:20.073
Did she say something to you?
Something that scared you?

44:21.784 --> 44:24.911
- El dijo.
- "El dijo"?

44:26.372 --> 44:28.456
What do you mean, "He said"?

44:29.124 --> 44:33.711
- Era un hombre.
- It was a man?

45:11.458 --> 45:13.751
Do you

45:14.670 --> 45:18.464
like working here?

45:19.800 --> 45:22.176
Well, photocopying isn't much fun.

45:24.513 --> 45:27.682
- What?
- Knock, knock. Sorry I'm late, guys.

45:27.808 --> 45:29.809
You ready to go, kiddo?

45:29.935 --> 45:33.312
- So, how's school?
- Fine.

45:34.690 --> 45:36.649
Any of your classmates
giving you a hard time?

45:36.775 --> 45:39.318
No, they've been nice.

45:40.988 --> 45:42.655
You sleeping okay?

45:43.449 --> 45:47.243
That's not really what
you want to talk about, is it, Doug?

45:47.327 --> 45:48.661
You got me.

45:51.999 --> 45:55.585
Question 16, am I afraid of the dark?
You answered no.

45:55.669 --> 46:00.339
Question 23, am I afraid of being alone?
You answered no.

46:01.008 --> 46:03.342
26, am I afraid of my parents? No.

46:03.469 --> 46:06.512
You answered no
to everything in that section.

46:07.222 --> 46:10.141
I think that some of those
should have been yeses.

46:10.225 --> 46:11.809
Everybody is scared of something.

46:11.894 --> 46:13.936
Working through our fears,
conquering them,

46:14.021 --> 46:15.855
is how we get better.

46:17.024 --> 46:20.359
So, I want you to tell me,
what scares you?

46:23.030 --> 46:28.201
I'll tell you what scares me
if you tell me what scares you.

46:31.205 --> 46:32.705
Fair enough.

46:35.667 --> 46:37.668
When I was a kid, I was climbing a tree,

46:37.753 --> 46:40.546
and I accidentally put my hand
through a giant hornets' nest.

46:40.672 --> 46:43.716
And they didn't like it.
I was stung over a hundred times.

46:43.842 --> 46:46.385
They had to rush me to the hospital.

46:47.221 --> 46:49.722
Been afraid of hornets ever since.

46:50.891 --> 46:53.226
I don't climb many trees either.

46:54.061 --> 46:56.854
Everybody has fears.
Now, what scares you?

46:57.564 --> 47:00.900
- Me.
- You scare yourself?

47:01.360 --> 47:05.571
- Sometimes.
- Why? What about yourself scares you?

47:07.533 --> 47:09.534
I have bad thoughts.

47:09.618 --> 47:11.911
- About what?
- People.

47:12.579 --> 47:17.208
- People in general or certain people?
- Certain people.

47:17.292 --> 47:19.085
- Like who?
- You.

47:21.088 --> 47:23.422
You have bad thoughts about me?

47:24.633 --> 47:27.051
- Why?
- I just do.

47:29.304 --> 47:32.598
Did I do something or say something
that upset you?

47:33.600 --> 47:36.644
It's just the way you are.

47:37.938 --> 47:39.272
How am I?

47:41.149 --> 47:43.609
- Facile.
- Facile?

47:46.113 --> 47:47.697
Do you even know what that means?

47:47.781 --> 47:52.076
Easily comprehended.
Often lacking sincerity or depth.

47:52.619 --> 47:54.287
You're smug, too.

47:55.664 --> 47:58.624
Want me to tell you what that means?

47:58.750 --> 48:03.212
- Lf I seemed smug or facile I want to...
- Don't apologise.

48:03.297 --> 48:04.505
Why not?

48:05.257 --> 48:09.468
You're a grown-up. It's embarrassing.

48:18.979 --> 48:22.982
Number 12,
I worry about what's going to happen.

48:23.859 --> 48:26.861
- Yes or no?
- You want me to answer that?

48:27.821 --> 48:30.448
- Yes or no?
- No.

48:32.993 --> 48:34.827
That should be a yes.

48:39.374 --> 48:41.792
Should we talk about school now?

48:42.294 --> 48:44.795
My grades are getting a lot better.

48:51.553 --> 48:56.057
I talked to a lot of kids, I don't think
I've ever felt like that before.

48:56.183 --> 48:57.516
Like what?

48:59.061 --> 49:00.478
Threatened.

49:06.735 --> 49:10.196
I know a specialist,
I'm gonna call him in the morning.

49:52.906 --> 49:54.407
Are you mad at me?

49:54.533 --> 49:57.284
No. No, I'm just tired.

49:58.078 --> 50:01.414
- Want me to brush your hair?
- No, thanks.

50:02.749 --> 50:05.584
- Are you sure?
- Some other time.

50:06.461 --> 50:09.714
It will make you feel better.
I'll get the brush.

50:09.798 --> 50:11.590
I said no, thank you.

50:18.932 --> 50:21.267
Doug said something, didn't he?

50:23.603 --> 50:28.399
Doug? No.
Doug says you're doing great.

50:29.443 --> 50:32.111
- What did he tell you?
- Nothing.

51:05.312 --> 51:06.479
Hello.

51:16.323 --> 51:18.157
Try again, sorry.

55:52.307 --> 55:54.892
For as much as it hath pleased
Almighty God,

55:54.976 --> 55:58.145
of his great mercy,
to take unto himself the soul

55:58.271 --> 56:00.147
of our dear brother, here departed,

56:00.273 --> 56:03.233
we, therefore,
commit his body to the ground.

56:03.943 --> 56:08.614
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes
and dust to dust,

56:09.824 --> 56:14.328
in sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life,

56:14.454 --> 56:17.331
through our Lord, Jesus Christ, amen.

56:49.656 --> 56:53.325
You think it's my fault, don't you?

57:02.836 --> 57:06.672
It's no one's fault. It was an accident.

57:21.521 --> 57:23.021
There was no sign of forced entry,

57:23.148 --> 57:25.190
he was alone
and the doors were locked.

57:25.316 --> 57:28.902
I know he didn't kill himself.
He was scared.

57:29.028 --> 57:32.573
He came out of that room with her, Mike,
and he was scared.

57:32.699 --> 57:34.158
He said she threatened him.

57:34.242 --> 57:36.410
Emily, you're in shock,
let's not get carried away.

57:36.536 --> 57:40.122
Diego, he said it was a man
on the phone.

57:40.206 --> 57:41.748
There was no one else in the house.

57:41.875 --> 57:44.209
Do you think I don't know
how crazy this sounds?

57:44.335 --> 57:46.962
Kid in that state of mind
is not the most reliable witness.

57:47.046 --> 57:50.382
But why was he in that state of mind?
Why was Doug?

57:52.552 --> 57:55.137
Pull my phone records.
See if she called him.

57:55.221 --> 57:57.890
I already did, Emily. There was no call.

57:59.726 --> 58:02.728
So, you're saying that
you've seen this before,

58:02.854 --> 58:05.063
someone just dying like that?

58:06.274 --> 58:11.403
Truly? I'm shocked every day by
the violence people do to themselves.

58:12.447 --> 58:17.367
Her mom and dad had deadbolts
on their bedroom door, big ones.

58:18.703 --> 58:22.789
Something came through that door,
and whatever it was,

58:22.916 --> 58:26.251
they didn't want it
ever coming through there again.

58:29.714 --> 58:32.257
- Hey guys, come on, are you ready?
- Yeah.

58:33.259 --> 58:35.260
- Let's get to it?
- Yeah.

59:02.580 --> 59:06.291
Take me through the conversation,
Margaret, about the oven.

59:07.126 --> 59:09.920
Eddie said, "We're gonna burn her,"
and I said, "Okay."

59:10.004 --> 59:11.755
So it was Edward's idea?

59:11.839 --> 59:14.383
Just the oven part,
we both wanted her dead.

59:14.467 --> 59:18.679
Why did you say that it was God's will
that you should kill your daughter?

59:19.138 --> 59:22.057
- Why is that funny, Margaret?
- 'Cause she's not my daughter.

59:22.141 --> 59:25.686
You think your daughter is the devil?
Evil incarnate?

59:26.312 --> 59:28.021
I don't care what you call it.

59:28.147 --> 59:30.774
But you have stated
that she kills people?

59:30.858 --> 59:34.611
Not by her own hand, theyjust die.

59:35.196 --> 59:36.989
I had two brothers,

59:39.117 --> 59:40.993
Eddie had three sisters.

59:41.953 --> 59:46.039
Soon as she was born,
they just started dying.

59:49.961 --> 59:51.712
Me and Eddie, I guess,

59:54.007 --> 59:57.634
she couldn't get rid of us
until she found somebody else.

01:00:12.692 --> 01:00:14.985
The nurse on duty heard screaming,

01:00:15.069 --> 01:00:18.739
found Mrs Sullivan on the floor
clawing at her own skin,

01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:21.533
absolutely convinced she was on fire.

01:00:32.086 --> 01:00:35.255
In no condition for visitors
as you can see.

01:00:35.548 --> 01:00:38.717
If you'd like,
I can let you see Mr Sullivan.

01:00:39.552 --> 01:00:40.719
Okay.

01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:06.370
I know I'm probably the last person
you want to see right now,

01:01:06.454 --> 01:01:11.333
but you're the only one that I can talk to.

01:01:11.417 --> 01:01:12.751
Who died?

01:01:15.254 --> 01:01:17.923
- A friend.
- You're scared.

01:01:19.258 --> 01:01:20.926
You ought to be.

01:01:23.262 --> 01:01:25.222
Is she...

01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:31.269
- What is she?
- I can tell you what she's not.

01:01:32.271 --> 01:01:35.524
She's not a daughter of mine. She's not
a 10-year-old having trouble in school.

01:01:35.608 --> 01:01:38.276
And she's not some innocent victim
whose door you busted down

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:40.112
and life you saved.

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:43.115
She's not going anywhere soon, lady.

01:01:43.616 --> 01:01:45.701
Not till she's good and done with you.

01:01:45.785 --> 01:01:48.787
- Done with me how?
- However she wants.

01:01:50.248 --> 01:01:52.874
You think it's an accident
her ending up with you?

01:01:52.959 --> 01:01:55.293
She saw you coming a mile away.

01:01:55.753 --> 01:01:59.631
Why me? I don't have anything.

01:01:59.882 --> 01:02:04.636
You have that you're good. Kindness.
Decency. That's what she feeds on.

01:02:04.971 --> 01:02:10.142
Bleeds you dry, moves on to the next.
We were a big family,

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:14.146
she went through us
like a wrecking ball.

01:02:15.106 --> 01:02:17.482
It's like she sees everything.

01:02:18.151 --> 01:02:21.445
And what she doesn't see, she senses.

01:02:22.822 --> 01:02:26.825
Like when you call a friend
and they pick it up before it rings?

01:02:27.744 --> 01:02:31.288
They say when you're born
you're given your eternal soul.

01:02:32.331 --> 01:02:35.667
The part of you that lives on, lives again.

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:40.172
Whatever evil she is,
didn't come from us.

01:02:41.007 --> 01:02:42.591
It was already there.

01:02:42.675 --> 01:02:46.178
From the moment she came into being,
she brought something with her.

01:02:46.262 --> 01:02:48.597
Something older, destructive.

01:02:50.516 --> 01:02:52.184
Soul of a demon.

01:02:58.024 --> 01:03:00.150
What does she want?

01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:04.362
To know what your idea of hell is

01:03:07.366 --> 01:03:08.492
and make you live there.

01:04:54.223 --> 01:04:55.974
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:04:57.476 --> 01:05:01.313
You weren't there so I took the bus.

01:05:01.647 --> 01:05:04.441
Sorry, work, I lost track of time.

01:05:06.402 --> 01:05:08.987
It's okay, I know how busy you are.

01:05:11.282 --> 01:05:16.494
Doesn't matter anyway, the bus
stops right at the end of the street.

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:20.790
So I can always get home,
whether you're there or not.

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:22.751
Lucky.

01:05:26.672 --> 01:05:28.340
Where's the phone?

01:05:29.342 --> 01:05:31.468
It wasn't working, so...

01:05:39.352 --> 01:05:42.938
Wow. That one, too.

01:05:47.026 --> 01:05:50.987
We had gym today.
I'm gonna have a shower.

01:05:55.368 --> 01:05:58.453
- Are they being nice to her?
- Who?

01:05:58.537 --> 01:05:59.871
My mother.

01:06:01.874 --> 01:06:03.667
How would I know that?

01:06:04.168 --> 01:06:07.170
I thought you said
you were going to see her.

01:06:10.049 --> 01:06:11.716
I never said that.

01:06:15.721 --> 01:06:17.555
I must have dreamt it.

01:06:34.865 --> 01:06:37.409
- Nancy.
- Emily.

01:06:38.911 --> 01:06:42.747
I'm so sorry about Doug.
I know you two were close.

01:06:43.082 --> 01:06:45.041
Do you have a minute?

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:50.422
I was just wondering if you've had any
luck finding a place for Lilith?

01:06:50.881 --> 01:06:54.175
Still looking. You know,
more kids than homes right now.

01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:56.428
So, how long you think
we're talking here? Like...

01:06:56.554 --> 01:06:59.764
Honestly, she's not my first priority.

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:02.517
She's in a safe environment with
someone who understands her needs.

01:07:02.601 --> 01:07:03.935
Nancy,

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:09.774
if there's anything that
you could do to expedite

01:07:10.192 --> 01:07:13.111
- the process...
- Are you serious?

01:07:13.612 --> 01:07:17.365
Emily, you petitioned for custody,
you got it.

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:20.035
She's your responsibility. Make it work.

01:07:20.119 --> 01:07:24.956
How? How do I make it work
if it's not working?

01:07:25.082 --> 01:07:29.294
With the same coping skills you teach
these moms and dads every week!

01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:32.547
Walk the talk, Emily! Walk the talk!

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:42.974
See you next time. Good work.

01:08:15.466 --> 01:08:16.508
Why is she hurting...

01:08:16.634 --> 01:08:21.179
Hey, wait a minute. Who do you think
you are, barging in there like that?

01:08:21.263 --> 01:08:24.765
It's okay, Diane,
Emily's been under a lot of stress lately,

01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:29.187
but she's really nice to me and
I hope I can stay with her a long time.

01:08:30.147 --> 01:08:32.189
Don't ever do that again.

01:08:34.026 --> 01:08:35.859
See you next week, Diane.

01:08:35.986 --> 01:08:38.154
Don't worry,
it was all a misunderstanding.

01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:48.706
- You're not going back there.
- Why, Emily?

01:08:52.002 --> 01:08:57.048
Why, Emily? Why, Emily? Why, Emily?
Why, Emily? Why, Emily?

01:08:57.174 --> 01:09:02.386
Why, Emily? Why, Emily? Why, Emily?
Why, Emily? Why, Emily?

01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:07.058
Why, Emily? Why, Emily? Why, Emily?
Why, Emily? Why, Emily?

01:09:07.184 --> 01:09:10.895
Why, Emily? Why, Emily? Why, Emily?
Why, Emily? Why, Emily?

01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:12.647
Why, Emily?

01:09:16.234 --> 01:09:19.194
Can I go back to group next week?

01:09:22.032 --> 01:09:24.408
You're never going back there!

01:09:26.245 --> 01:09:27.912
Are you sure?

01:09:32.751 --> 01:09:35.587
No. No.

01:10:18.756 --> 01:10:21.466
- I know.
- You were terrific back there.

01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:23.885
Really enjoyed the service, Father.
Thanks.

01:10:23.969 --> 01:10:27.931
- Mike.
- Emily.

01:10:30.267 --> 01:10:34.479
They are not crazy, Mike. Her parents.

01:10:34.563 --> 01:10:36.064
They're right about her.

01:10:36.148 --> 01:10:39.400
You want to wind up where they are?
Keep talking like this.

01:10:39.485 --> 01:10:41.986
Emily, you're grieving for Doug

01:10:42.071 --> 01:10:44.906
and you're still confused
about what Diego did.

01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:47.742
- Aren't you?
- Diego grew up in a bad home,

01:10:47.826 --> 01:10:50.620
he saw violence, he repeated it,
that's the cycle.

01:10:50.704 --> 01:10:54.207
- You know that better than anyone.
- Why did she lie about calling him?

01:10:54.291 --> 01:10:57.210
Because she's a liar, but that
doesn't mean she made him do it.

01:10:57.294 --> 01:10:58.962
Let me tell you what Lily is.

01:10:59.046 --> 01:11:02.507
She's a damaged child,
she's a deceitful child,

01:11:02.591 --> 01:11:04.217
she's a manipulative child.

01:11:04.301 --> 01:11:07.804
But a damaged, deceitful,
manipulative child is not a demon.

01:11:07.888 --> 01:11:09.722
You think I'm crazy.

01:11:11.642 --> 01:11:15.603
You believe in there.
But out here it's all just bullshit?

01:11:16.563 --> 01:11:19.691
Mike, you know I'm not crazy.

01:11:19.775 --> 01:11:23.069
Don't run away from this
just because it scares you.

01:11:23.153 --> 01:11:25.655
I'll tell you what is scaring me
is not recognising my friend.

01:11:25.739 --> 01:11:27.657
- Get some help. Seriously.
- Mike...

01:11:27.741 --> 01:11:29.826
I don't want to report you.

01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:20.126
Good night.

01:13:20.771 --> 01:13:22.939
Mrs Lynch, I told you that...

01:13:23.023 --> 01:13:25.691
Do you think I'm an idiot?
Do you think I'm just making this up?

01:13:25.776 --> 01:13:28.903
- That's not what you said. I'm not stupid.
- Yeah, no.

01:13:28.987 --> 01:13:30.405
You never said anything
about unsupervised visits.

01:13:30.489 --> 01:13:31.531
No, that is not what I said.

01:13:31.615 --> 01:13:33.449
You said if my husband got help,
then my son could come home.

01:13:33.534 --> 01:13:35.701
- I did not. No.
- Nothing between the lines there.

01:13:35.786 --> 01:13:36.869
You never said that...

01:13:36.954 --> 01:13:38.496
Who do you think you are
telling me how to raise my son?

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:39.622
- Mrs Lynch...
- You know nothing about me.

01:13:39.706 --> 01:13:41.707
You know nothing about my son.
You know nothing about my family.

01:13:41.792 --> 01:13:42.834
Will you please let me respond?

01:13:42.918 --> 01:13:44.877
How I raise my child is
none of your business.

01:13:44.962 --> 01:13:46.003
Would you let... Would you...

01:13:46.088 --> 01:13:47.713
How my son and his father relate
is none of your business.

01:13:47.798 --> 01:13:51.259
Shut the fuck up,
you miserable, miserable woman

01:13:51.343 --> 01:13:53.970
before I come and beat your ass
like you beat your son!

01:13:54.054 --> 01:13:55.847
I have your address!

01:13:55.931 --> 01:13:59.308
Think about that before you call
and swear at me!

01:14:00.227 --> 01:14:03.938
Okay, so, you're certainly in no state
of mind to be here right now.

01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:07.316
Come on, it's late,
you look like shit, go home.

01:14:07.818 --> 01:14:09.819
I don't want to go home.

01:14:16.326 --> 01:14:17.493
Hello?

01:14:27.504 --> 01:14:29.005
It's for you.

01:14:36.930 --> 01:14:38.181
Emily Jenkins.

01:14:38.265 --> 01:14:41.017
You shouldn't leave me
home alone, Emily.

01:14:49.193 --> 01:14:50.359
Wayne?

01:15:42.913 --> 01:15:45.122
There you are. I made supper.

01:15:47.334 --> 01:15:51.212
Don't ignore me.
My mother used to ignore me.

01:16:18.907 --> 01:16:22.451
Emily? Can I come in?

01:16:23.912 --> 01:16:25.413
I'm scared.

01:16:33.088 --> 01:16:38.843
Emily? Please? I know you're in there.

01:16:40.304 --> 01:16:41.804
Please, Emily?

01:17:09.333 --> 01:17:14.003
Let me in, let me in.

01:17:14.921 --> 01:17:17.340
Let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in,

01:17:17.424 --> 01:17:19.550
let me in, let me in, let me in.

01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:21.385
Leave me alone.

01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:43.884
Please, help me.

01:18:45.137 --> 01:18:47.888
Please! No, please open the door?

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:51.016
Open the door, she's coming!

01:18:52.477 --> 01:18:55.146
- Drive.
- There's nobody out there.

01:18:56.606 --> 01:19:03.070
- Drive!
- There is nobody out there. Look.

01:19:08.785 --> 01:19:10.786
There's nobody out there.

01:20:01.505 --> 01:20:02.922
It's okay.

01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:07.343
Leaving the child unattended
is a jailable offence.

01:20:11.306 --> 01:20:13.641
You have to do what I say.

01:20:13.725 --> 01:20:17.645
If I say I want to go to group,
you have to do it.

01:20:18.355 --> 01:20:23.234
If I say I want a new dress,
you have to do it.

01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:28.364
If I say I want ice cream every day,
after school,

01:20:29.825 --> 01:20:33.327
you have to do it, okay?

01:20:36.998 --> 01:20:42.002
Don't be sad.
This is your new beginning.

01:21:08.947 --> 01:21:10.114
Emily.

01:21:16.037 --> 01:21:20.499
I tried to call you.
Good news, we found a home for Lily.

01:21:21.042 --> 01:21:23.878
Family in Cloverfield.
Really good people.

01:21:24.337 --> 01:21:27.214
They're picking her up Friday,
after school.

01:21:29.259 --> 01:21:31.719
What's the matter? They're perfect.

01:21:36.057 --> 01:21:40.227
- Lf they take her...
- The whole thing starts all over again.

01:21:40.312 --> 01:21:42.688
You can't let her go,
you can't let her stay.

01:21:44.065 --> 01:21:45.316
Leaves you one option.

01:21:45.942 --> 01:21:46.984
- I can't.
- You have to.

01:21:47.068 --> 01:21:48.903
- You don't understand.
- Don't tell me I don't understand.

01:21:48.987 --> 01:21:51.030
You've had her, what, two months?
I had her 10 years.

01:21:51.114 --> 01:21:53.032
We had her 10 years.

01:21:53.116 --> 01:21:55.826
- Think of it as a test of faith.
- I don't wanna have any faith.

01:21:55.911 --> 01:21:58.495
How about anger?
You got some of that?

01:22:08.048 --> 01:22:12.259
- How? How do I...
- Kill her?

01:22:14.512 --> 01:22:15.930
In her sleep.

01:22:16.598 --> 01:22:18.766
That's the only time you got
the upper hand, is when she's sleeping,

01:22:18.850 --> 01:22:20.476
but she almost never does.

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:22.811
We checked on her room,
every night for three months.

01:22:22.896 --> 01:22:26.774
First night she slept was the night
that you busted in our front door.

01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:31.528
And I'll tell you what I'd do different,
count yourself dead at the outset.

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:34.698
Accept that going in,
use it to your advantage.

01:22:36.284 --> 01:22:39.078
If you're not afraid, she can't hurt you.

01:23:03.436 --> 01:23:05.980
No money, no way to contact her.

01:23:06.982 --> 01:23:10.359
Must have went 80 on the way back,
straight through,

01:23:10.443 --> 01:23:12.444
didn't stop for nothing.

01:23:13.321 --> 01:23:16.907
When we got home,
she was waiting for us on the doorstep.

01:23:17.367 --> 01:23:21.412
Where is she now?
Some family, somewhere?

01:23:21.997 --> 01:23:25.332
Eddie said, "We're gonna burn her,"
and I said, "Okay."

01:23:27.377 --> 01:23:30.754
They did what I said for a while,
but then they stopped

01:23:32.007 --> 01:23:34.216
and started with the secrets.

01:23:34.968 --> 01:23:37.678
But they weren't really secrets, I guess,

01:23:38.263 --> 01:23:41.265
because I always knew
what they were thinking.

01:23:49.941 --> 01:23:53.777
- Don't leave me.
- It's okay, Maggie. I'll check on you later.

01:25:02.722 --> 01:25:05.891
I'm glad you're getting
the help you need, Daddy.

01:25:27.831 --> 01:25:28.956
Get somebody down here now.

01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:30.415
- Somebody call it in.
- Base, this is Sanchez.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.709
We're gonna need medical personnel
right away to the cafeteria...

01:25:46.516 --> 01:25:48.600
- Edward Sullivan...
- I know.

01:25:49.644 --> 01:25:51.854
Something I want you to hear.

01:25:52.814 --> 01:25:56.150
This came in this morning,
right about 2:00 a.m.

01:25:56.234 --> 01:25:58.026
You might wanna sit.

01:26:02.115 --> 01:26:05.742
...decide what to do with you
and your family, Michael.

01:26:06.786 --> 01:26:12.291
Every time I think about it,
a voice in my head says, "Kill them."

01:26:13.334 --> 01:26:14.751
Who is this?

01:26:15.503 --> 01:26:17.337
Just a little girl.

01:26:18.882 --> 01:26:22.259
- Up past her bedtime.
- Lilith?

01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:31.643
You were right. She did call Doug.
She used your cell phone.

01:26:33.396 --> 01:26:35.772
Took me a couple of extra days
to check your cell phone records,

01:26:35.857 --> 01:26:38.275
but that's what she's been using.

01:26:39.861 --> 01:26:43.530
- She's tearing me apart.
- You're not crazy, Emily. This is real.

01:26:43.615 --> 01:26:45.908
Edward said I have to kill her.

01:26:53.458 --> 01:26:55.042
I'll help you.

01:27:00.715 --> 01:27:02.883
Keep her at the house.

01:27:02.967 --> 01:27:05.385
Physically you're fine. How's the stress?

01:27:05.470 --> 01:27:07.596
I'm not sleeping.

01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:10.390
I was hoping you could
give me something.

01:27:12.227 --> 01:27:14.561
Take one of these, you'll sleep.

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:32.246
Lily?

01:28:28.469 --> 01:28:29.594
What?

01:28:32.807 --> 01:28:34.349
Oh, my God.

01:29:49.592 --> 01:29:51.093
Who is this?

01:29:51.302 --> 01:29:54.012
Emily, it's Wayne,

01:29:54.097 --> 01:29:56.515
I just got a call, Mike's dead.

01:29:56.974 --> 01:29:58.934
- No, he's...
- Listen, Em.

01:29:59.018 --> 01:30:01.228
They think he shot himself.

01:30:01.813 --> 01:30:05.565
- Emily? Em?
- No...

01:30:08.903 --> 01:30:12.572
Emily? Emily, are you okay?

01:30:26.796 --> 01:30:32.092
Get out of my house!

01:30:41.436 --> 01:30:43.437
Get out of my house!

01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:54.406
Don't yell at me!

01:31:22.101 --> 01:31:26.271
Emily, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

01:31:26.355 --> 01:31:29.524
Can I come in so we can talk
and work it out?

01:31:34.614 --> 01:31:36.031
Emily?

01:31:37.283 --> 01:31:39.117
Stay away from me!

01:31:39.202 --> 01:31:43.997
Don't be mad. I said I was sorry.
I'll brush your hair for you.

01:31:44.081 --> 01:31:45.749
Stay away from me!

01:32:04.894 --> 01:32:09.898
No! No. No.

01:32:36.342 --> 01:32:40.387
Emily. Emily.

01:32:41.639 --> 01:32:45.684
We need to learn healthier ways
of resolving conflict, Emily.

01:32:49.689 --> 01:32:53.400
Most families
don't even know they have a problem

01:32:55.695 --> 01:32:57.529
until it's too late.

01:33:12.712 --> 01:33:16.214
What are you doing,
you silly pumpkinhead?

01:33:16.924 --> 01:33:20.218
You don't want me to come under there
and get you, do you?

01:33:20.303 --> 01:33:23.096
- No.
- I'm going to count to three.

01:33:24.515 --> 01:33:28.560
- One, two...
- No.

01:33:29.228 --> 01:33:32.897
Two and a half, two and three quarters,

01:33:34.567 --> 01:33:37.944
three. Here I come.

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:43.325
- No! What do you want?
- What you wanted from your mother.

01:33:46.078 --> 01:33:48.580
I want you to love me.

01:33:51.334 --> 01:33:53.835
Okay. I will.

01:33:57.548 --> 01:33:59.257
Come tuck me in.

01:34:03.679 --> 01:34:05.513
Oh, my God.

01:34:12.647 --> 01:34:14.105
Emily.

01:34:59.527 --> 01:35:01.027
Chamomile.

01:35:06.325 --> 01:35:10.036
Maybe you should have it,
you look stressed.

01:35:11.664 --> 01:35:13.456
I'll have one later.

01:35:18.754 --> 01:35:22.382
I'm really sorry
that I let things get like this.

01:35:22.466 --> 01:35:25.719
- We'll do better from now on.
- We have to.

01:35:26.971 --> 01:35:29.180
Someone could get hurt.

01:35:31.475 --> 01:35:33.601
What should we do tomorrow?

01:35:35.104 --> 01:35:39.357
- Surprise me.
- I'm not so good at surprises.

01:35:39.859 --> 01:35:42.026
You're getting better.

01:38:00.833 --> 01:38:02.584
Everybody get out okay?

01:38:07.882 --> 01:38:10.675
Ma'am, anyone else inside? Yes or no?

01:38:19.101 --> 01:38:20.643
That was mean.

01:38:33.991 --> 01:38:37.869
You follow us downtown,
we'll find someplace for you to stay.

01:38:38.704 --> 01:38:40.747
Miss? You okay?

01:38:45.586 --> 01:38:47.045
I'm fine.

01:38:54.053 --> 01:38:57.180
Maybe we can find a hotel
with a swimming pool.

01:39:08.317 --> 01:39:12.487
- Where are we going?
- You said I should surprise you.

01:39:18.494 --> 01:39:20.495
She hated herself.

01:39:22.081 --> 01:39:24.082
And she hated you.

01:39:24.166 --> 01:39:28.086
They said it was an accident,
but you knew it wasn't.

01:39:28.170 --> 01:39:29.504
Your mother.

01:39:29.588 --> 01:39:32.423
That's why you never had
any kids of your own.

01:39:32.508 --> 01:39:35.009
That's what you're afraid of, isn't it?

01:39:35.094 --> 01:39:38.179
The part of you that's her.

01:39:39.515 --> 01:39:41.224
What are you?

01:39:49.483 --> 01:39:52.235
- Slow down!
- What the hell are you?

01:39:52.319 --> 01:39:56.447
You're upset, you shouldn't be driving.

01:40:13.173 --> 01:40:14.340
Mom.

01:40:21.098 --> 01:40:24.976
Mom, slow down, you're scaring me.

01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:34.318
Mom! Slow down, please!

01:40:38.741 --> 01:40:40.324
Look out!

01:40:42.828 --> 01:40:44.495
- It's not real.
- Yes, it is!

01:40:47.166 --> 01:40:49.834
It's not real!

01:41:11.857 --> 01:41:13.399
Are you scared?

01:41:19.198 --> 01:41:20.531
I'm not.

01:41:56.026 --> 01:41:57.568
I'm not afraid.

01:42:14.962 --> 01:42:16.546
Just die!

01:42:57.212 --> 01:43:01.549
No! No!

01:43:04.428 --> 01:43:06.345
No!
