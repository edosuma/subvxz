03:02.838 --> 03:06.642
<i>I couldn't believe my cousin Fred</i>
<i>would just show up that way.</i>

03:06.643 --> 03:10.636
<i>On the other hand,</i>
<i>it was absolutely typical.</i>

03:11.648 --> 03:14.650
<i>I was furious, but tried not to show it.</i>

03:14.651 --> 03:16.652
- You could have called.
- I did call.

03:16.653 --> 03:19.658
From a pay phone that cut me off
and swallowed my change.

03:19.659 --> 03:23.653
- You called once from the airport.
- At least once. I would not, not call.

03:27.668 --> 03:31.671
- How long do you plan to stay?
- Good question.

03:31.672 --> 03:34.675
- More than three days?
- Oh, yeah.

03:34.676 --> 03:36.677
- You know what Dr. Johnson said?
- No.

03:36.678 --> 03:40.682
<i>'Guests, like fish,
begin to stink on the third day.'</i>

03:40.683 --> 03:42.684
That sounds about right.

03:42.685 --> 03:46.680
You'll find I begin to stink on the first day.

03:53.699 --> 03:57.703
I saw the prettiest girl
at the Trade Fair today.

03:57.704 --> 03:59.705
You spoke with her? Of course not.

03:59.706 --> 04:03.710
I'm beginning to reconsider my attitude
toward female beauty.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.711
I think it's very bad.

04:05.712 --> 04:09.716
You see a beautiful girl
and you're subject to all these emotions.

04:09.717 --> 04:11.718
Some are very powerful,
almost uncontrollable.

04:11.719 --> 04:12.719
Yeah...

04:12.720 --> 04:17.615
They are. You haven't even spoken with
a girl and already you want to marry her.

04:17.726 --> 04:18.726
I think...

04:18.728 --> 04:21.731
Inordinate concern for beauty
has wrecked more lives...

04:21.732 --> 04:23.732
- Wrecked lives?
- Yeah.

04:23.733 --> 04:26.736
- At the lake, Charlie Johnson.
- That was pathetic.

04:26.737 --> 04:28.738
There are so many cases.

04:28.739 --> 04:31.743
In our family,
the 'beautiful Boynton sisters' thing.

04:31.744 --> 04:35.737
- Is this related to you and Betty?
- No, that was different.

04:43.758 --> 04:45.759
There are really attractive girls there.

04:45.760 --> 04:48.763
This is where
the cool Trade Fair girls come.

04:48.764 --> 04:50.765
Great. <i>'Cool Trade Fair girls.'</i>

04:50.766 --> 04:52.768
A lot of people come here.
It's quite popular.

04:52.769 --> 04:56.772
If you wanted to meet cool Trade Fair girls,
you could go to the fair itself.

04:56.773 --> 04:59.775
The atmosphere's not so good
and trade fairs are intermittent...

04:59.776 --> 05:02.778
...while the girls come here all the time.

05:02.779 --> 05:05.783
Trade Fair girls off season. Cool.
This is great stuff.

05:05.784 --> 05:09.788
A lot of them studied in London
and have terrific English accents.

05:09.789 --> 05:13.783
That's good? I hate that.

05:14.795 --> 05:16.796
Jesus, what was that all about?

05:16.797 --> 05:19.799
- What does <i>facha</i> mean?
- It's slang for <i>'fascist.'</i>

05:19.800 --> 05:20.800
Fascist?

05:20.801 --> 05:23.804
Don't worry, they call everyone that.

05:23.805 --> 05:25.806
Comb your hair, wear a tie, you're a <i>facha.</i>

05:25.807 --> 05:29.801
- A military uniform? Definitely <i>facha.</i>
- So, <i>facha</i> is something good, then.

05:30.813 --> 05:34.816
If it referred to the political movement
Mussolini led, I'd be offended.

05:34.817 --> 05:38.811
Men wearing this uniform died
ridding Europe of fascism.

05:51.839 --> 05:55.832
That's the cathedral.

06:05.854 --> 06:09.849
These are remnants
of the old Roman walls.

06:14.865 --> 06:18.870
The palace of the Catalan government.

06:18.871 --> 06:22.864
That's City Hall.

06:26.880 --> 06:29.882
Let's call it a night. You're obviously tired.

06:29.883 --> 06:32.885
After what happened?
I'm far too worked-up to call it a night.

06:32.886 --> 06:35.889
We had a close call back there.
It could've turned ugly.

06:35.890 --> 06:39.894
They obviously didn't mean <i>facha</i>
in the positive sense.

06:39.895 --> 06:43.899
With the controversy over NATO, this
may not be the best time for a fleet visit.

06:43.900 --> 06:46.902
There's a lot of anti-NATO feeling here.

06:46.903 --> 06:48.904
- Anti-what?
- Anti-NATO.

06:48.905 --> 06:51.908
- Anti-NATO?
- Yeah.

06:51.909 --> 06:54.912
Actually, here it's OTAN.

06:54.913 --> 06:57.916
- They're against OTAN?
- Yeah.

06:57.917 --> 07:01.910
<i>What are they for? Soviet troops racing</i>
<i>across Europe, eating the croissants?</i>

07:02.923 --> 07:05.925
What exactly are you doing here?

07:05.926 --> 07:09.930
Advance man for the 6th Fleet.
The last fleet visit was a disaster.

07:09.931 --> 07:13.924
I'm here early to smooth things out
and make sure nothing goes wrong.

07:14.937 --> 07:16.938
That will be tough.

07:16.939 --> 07:20.933
It's an assignment that'll require
a lot of diplomacy and tact.

07:21.944 --> 07:23.945
I'm surprised they gave it to you.

07:23.946 --> 07:27.950
It doesn't require that much tact.

07:27.951 --> 07:29.953
This is my favorite Barcelona avenue.

07:29.954 --> 07:31.956
<i>Paseo de Gracia.</i>

07:31.957 --> 07:35.961
It's the Michigan Avenue of Barcelona.

07:35.962 --> 07:37.964
Yeah, nice.

07:37.965 --> 07:39.965
After all that's happened tonight...

07:39.966 --> 07:42.969
...I won't be able to sleep
without more to drink.

07:42.970 --> 07:45.972
This avenue is <i>Diagonal.</i>

07:45.973 --> 07:49.967
Actually it's more like Michigan Avenue.

07:54.984 --> 07:58.986
This thing of always falling in love
with incredibly attractive girls is...

07:58.987 --> 08:00.989
...really bad.

08:00.990 --> 08:04.996
Maybe by resolving to go out
only with plain, or even homely, girls...

08:04.997 --> 08:05.997
...I could avoid all that.

08:05.998 --> 08:10.001
I've got a real romantic illusion problem.

08:10.002 --> 08:14.006
Instead of fantasy built on the slope
of an eyebrow or curl of an upper lip...

08:14.007 --> 08:18.010
...to see the real person,
look into her eyes and see her soul.

08:18.011 --> 08:19.011
What?

08:19.012 --> 08:23.006
I've resolved to go out only with plain,
or even homely, girls.

08:24.018 --> 08:27.020
What if, and this is hypothetical...

08:27.021 --> 08:30.024
...the one girl with whom
you'd be happiest...

08:30.025 --> 08:33.028
...with the most wonderful personality,
or soul imaginable...

08:33.029 --> 08:34.029
...also was incredibly attractive?

08:34.030 --> 08:37.032
According to your theory,
you wouldn't even look at her.

08:37.033 --> 08:39.034
I'd look at her.
I just wouldn't go out with her.

08:39.035 --> 08:42.039
Your one chance at happiness
would be gone.

08:42.039 --> 08:46.044
I don't buy that there's just one girl
who's right for you.

08:46.045 --> 08:49.047
There are a lot of terrific plain
or homely women.

08:49.048 --> 08:52.050
What if you don't meet any of those girls?

08:52.051 --> 08:56.055
What if the only women you meet and like,
are also very attractive?

08:56.056 --> 08:57.056
Do you think I'm an idiot?

08:57.057 --> 09:01.061
If the only women I meet that I like
are attractive, I'd make an exception.

09:01.062 --> 09:05.066
Why did I tell you about this?
I must be drunk.

09:05.067 --> 09:07.271
No, you can confide in me.

09:07.272 --> 09:09.271
It was just an idea.

09:09.272 --> 09:12.875
Good, because it sounded pathetic.
Crazy.

09:12.876 --> 09:17.070
Thanks.

09:32.500 --> 09:36.103
<i>Cerdos</i> ? Pigs?

09:36.104 --> 09:37.104
They're calling us pigs.

09:37.105 --> 09:39.106
It's meant to hurt.

09:39.107 --> 09:41.109
Let's go.

09:41.110 --> 09:43.111
Do you have any paint or a marker?

09:43.112 --> 09:46.113
No!

09:46.114 --> 09:49.117
- Forget it.
- I'm not going to forget it!

09:49.118 --> 09:52.122
People have forgotten things for too long.

09:52.123 --> 09:54.124
This is not our country.

09:54.125 --> 09:57.128
You shouldn't be doing that.
We're guests here.

09:57.129 --> 09:59.131
How blind can you be?

09:59.132 --> 10:03.124
People like you make me sick!

10:17.152 --> 10:19.153
Okay.

10:19.154 --> 10:21.155
That's it. Let's go.

10:21.156 --> 10:23.157
You just leave it like that?

10:23.158 --> 10:25.159
'Yankee pigs go 'hoem' ?

10:25.160 --> 10:28.165
You'll paint the wall with a ballpoint pen?

10:28.166 --> 10:29.166
It's a felt-tip.

10:29.167 --> 10:33.161
Give me a break. I'm going.

10:35.174 --> 10:37.175
Listen, I'm going.

10:37.176 --> 10:40.178
I'm out of here.

10:40.179 --> 10:44.183
"Ciervos" with a 'V' not a 'B'.

10:44.184 --> 10:45.184
It's correct phonetically.

10:45.185 --> 10:47.186
<i>'Yankee deer.'</i>

10:47.187 --> 10:50.190
How is that an improvement?
<i>'Yankee deer go home.'</i>

10:50.191 --> 10:54.186
Would you prefer to be
a Yankee pig or a Yankee deer?

11:01.204 --> 11:03.205
Ted.

11:03.206 --> 11:06.210
What are you doing here?

11:06.211 --> 11:10.204
- You're going to the same party as we are.
- Yes.

11:11.217 --> 11:15.209
Good.

11:17.223 --> 11:20.225
We haven't met.
You're some royal personage?

11:20.226 --> 11:22.227
Isabel de Farnesio.

11:22.228 --> 11:25.232
My cousin Fred.
Marta works at the Trade Fair.

11:25.233 --> 11:27.234
I like your costume.

11:27.235 --> 11:30.238
Have you no costume, Ted?

11:30.239 --> 11:32.239
We must go.

11:32.240 --> 11:35.243
Let's split up. I'll go in your car and...

11:35.244 --> 11:38.246
...the princesses in Ted's.

11:38.247 --> 11:42.242
Yes?

11:43.254 --> 11:47.248
Okay.

11:50.261 --> 11:54.256
- Where in England did you learn English?
- Providence, Rhode Island.

12:01.275 --> 12:03.277
He's not at all the way he seems.

12:03.278 --> 12:06.280
He seems a typical American,
a big, unsophisticated child...

12:06.281 --> 12:08.282
...but he's more complex.

12:08.283 --> 12:12.286
- Really?
- Heard of the Marquis de Sade?

12:12.287 --> 12:14.289
Ted's great admirer of de Sade.

12:14.290 --> 12:16.292
And a follower of Dr. Johnson.

12:16.293 --> 12:20.298
He's a complex, and in some ways,
dangerous man.

12:20.299 --> 12:24.302
He has a romantic illusion problem.
Women find him fascinating.

12:24.303 --> 12:28.296
His nickname is <i>punta de diamante</i>,
point of a diamond.

12:29.308 --> 12:32.311
See that odd expression on his face?

12:32.312 --> 12:35.314
Under the normal clothes he wears...

12:35.315 --> 12:39.309
...are narrow leather straps,
drawn taut, so when he dances <i>...</i>

12:40.321 --> 12:41.321
What?

12:41.322 --> 12:44.324
Don't mention this.
He'd feel I violated a confidence.

12:44.325 --> 12:46.326
Thank you.

12:46.327 --> 12:50.322
Sit here.

12:52.336 --> 12:53.337
What's wrong?

12:53.338 --> 12:55.339
- I told them your nicknames.
- You're kidding.

12:55.340 --> 12:58.342
- Marta wanted to know.
- Ted, what are your names?

12:58.343 --> 13:00.345
- Don't.
- I only remember two others.

13:00.346 --> 13:03.347
Don't get into that.

13:03.348 --> 13:07.352
- What difference is it going to make?
- I mean it. Really. Don't.

13:07.353 --> 13:09.354
I'm supposed to be the childish one.

13:09.355 --> 13:12.358
- If he doesn't want to talk about it...
- It's the principle.

13:12.359 --> 13:15.362
- Principle?
- <i>'Crusty Fusty'</i> and <i>'The Big O.'</i>

13:15.363 --> 13:16.363
Jerk!

13:16.364 --> 13:19.366
- What does that mean?
- I don't believe you.

13:19.367 --> 13:21.369
What is the big deal?

13:21.370 --> 13:23.371
It's just...

13:23.372 --> 13:25.373
...lousy.

13:25.374 --> 13:28.378
Give me a break! Don't go.

13:28.379 --> 13:31.381
You're right. You do stink on the first day.

13:31.382 --> 13:35.376
Good-bye.

13:39.391 --> 13:41.392
That guy really gets to me.

13:41.393 --> 13:44.396
I admit I act like a jerk around him,
but he provokes it.

13:44.397 --> 13:47.400
Are those names related
to his <i>sadomasoquismo</i> ?

13:47.401 --> 13:51.395
No, it's something <i>...</i> Did you hear
that crack he made about my intelligence?

13:54.409 --> 13:58.402
Should we dance?

14:14.433 --> 14:16.434
<i>Sometimes we think...</i>

14:16.435 --> 14:20.439
...we almost always assume, we're going
through life surrounded by people.

14:20.440 --> 14:24.434
Then something happens and you realize:
We're entirely alone.

14:25.446 --> 14:26.446
Tonight, while shaving...

14:26.447 --> 14:30.440
...I always shave against the beard
for a closer shave...

14:31.452 --> 14:35.446
...I remembered this razor ad on TV
showing the hair follicles, like this.

14:36.458 --> 14:39.461
The first of the twin blades cuts them here.

14:39.462 --> 14:42.465
Then the hair snaps back
and the second blade cuts them here...

14:42.466 --> 14:45.469
...for a closer, cleaner shave.
That we know.

14:45.470 --> 14:47.472
But what struck me was:

14:47.473 --> 14:51.466
If the hair follicles are going
in this direction and the razor is too...

14:52.478 --> 14:56.481
...then they're shaving in the direction
of the beard, not against it.

14:56.482 --> 14:59.485
So I've shaved the wrong way all my life.

14:59.486 --> 15:01.487
Maybe I misremembered the ad.
The point is...

15:01.488 --> 15:05.492
...I could've shaved the wrong way
all my life and never have known it.

15:05.493 --> 15:09.486
Then I could have taught my son
to shave the wrong way, too.

15:12.501 --> 15:15.505
You have a son?

15:15.506 --> 15:16.506
No.

15:16.507 --> 15:20.501
But I might someday. Then, maybe
I'll teach him to shave the wrong way.

15:21.513 --> 15:24.514
I think maybe my English is not so good.

15:24.515 --> 15:27.518
Did you know that your costume
has your name in it?

15:27.519 --> 15:31.523
Where?

15:31.524 --> 15:35.517
God. How odd!

16:50.618 --> 16:54.610
First, we check with Seat and Opel.

16:55.623 --> 16:58.625
<i>Fred's thesis that I'd never meet</i>
<i>any terrific plain girls...</i>

16:58.626 --> 17:00.627
<i>...was already inoperative.</i>

17:00.628 --> 17:03.632
<i>Aurora, the princess with Marta</i>
<i>at the costume party...</i>

17:03.633 --> 17:07.627
<i>...invited me to a Lionel Hampton concert</i>
<i>Thursday night.</i>

17:09.641 --> 17:13.644
<i>Fred began his advance work</i>
<i>with a visit to the consulate...</i>

17:13.645 --> 17:16.646
<i>...which was less than a complete success.</i>

17:16.647 --> 17:18.650
I saw it as a judgment call.

17:18.651 --> 17:20.652
You were unaware of this order?

17:20.653 --> 17:24.656
I thought it applied to the khaki uniform.
Not the blue one, too.

17:24.657 --> 17:27.660
- You're ROTC?
- Yes, I am.

17:27.661 --> 17:30.663
This order, I must admit, troubles me.

17:30.664 --> 17:34.668
Men in this uniform died, ridding Europe
of fascism. I'm proud of this uniform.

17:34.669 --> 17:38.674
- It seems a bit cowardly to...
- Come on.

17:38.675 --> 17:42.669
The thing is,
I don't have any good civilian clothes.

17:45.683 --> 17:48.685
The blue one, I think.

17:48.686 --> 17:51.688
- You don't mind my borrowing it?
- No.

17:51.689 --> 17:53.691
- Really?
- It's okay.

17:53.692 --> 17:56.694
Spanish girls tend to be promiscuous.

17:56.695 --> 17:59.698
- You're such a prig.
- I didn't mean 'promiscuous' pejoratively.

17:59.699 --> 18:01.700
It's just a fact.

18:01.701 --> 18:04.704
They have a completely
different attitude towards sex.

18:04.705 --> 18:08.698
I wasn't using 'prig' pejoratively.

18:13.716 --> 18:15.718
Okay, I'm a prig.

18:15.719 --> 18:18.721
But, now I'm speaking sociologically.

18:18.722 --> 18:22.715
The sexual revolution reached Spain
later than the US, but went beyond it.

18:23.727 --> 18:27.721
I don't know what it was like
in other cities, but in Barcelona...

18:28.733 --> 18:31.737
...everything was swept aside.
The world was turned upside down...

18:31.738 --> 18:33.739
...and stayed there.

18:33.740 --> 18:37.744
Maybe the world was upside down before,
and now it's right-side up.

18:37.745 --> 18:41.737
No. I don't think that's it.

18:45.753 --> 18:49.758
I'm going out with Aurora on Thursday,
so I thought I'd read tonight.

18:49.759 --> 18:51.760
Aurora?

18:51.761 --> 18:53.762
The very nice, plain girl with Marta.

18:53.763 --> 18:57.767
She had extra tickets for a jazz concert.

18:57.768 --> 19:01.762
Jazz concert? That's tough.
You really are polite.

19:04.776 --> 19:07.779
- Is this how you dress to go out?
- Yes.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.781
Your Trade Fair outfit is so cool.

19:09.782 --> 19:12.785
- Those clothes are awful.
- Really? I think they're cool.

19:12.786 --> 19:16.789
Why do I always look better in mirrors
than in photographs?

19:16.790 --> 19:18.791
I like your outfit. Very New Wave.

19:18.792 --> 19:20.793
- You sure you don't want to go?
- No.

19:20.794 --> 19:24.788
Good.

19:29.807 --> 19:32.809
<i>Except for work,</i>
<i>I'd been in a funk for some time.</i>

19:32.810 --> 19:35.812
<i>I'd never mention that to Fred.</i>

19:35.813 --> 19:39.817
<i>He was the last person to trust</i>
<i>with a personal confidence.</i>

19:39.818 --> 19:42.820
<i>I don't know whether I had found God</i>
<i>in Barcelona...</i>

19:42.821 --> 19:44.822
<i>...or was having a religious phase.</i>

19:44.823 --> 19:48.827
<i>It all began after the sad and guilt-ridden</i>
<i>break up with Betty...</i>

19:48.828 --> 19:51.830
<i>...with whom I'd been deeply involved,</i>
<i>including carnally...</i>

19:51.831 --> 19:53.832
<i>...despite never having loved her.</i>

19:53.833 --> 19:56.836
<i>The attraction of physical beauty...</i>

19:56.837 --> 20:00.841
<i>...transformed a good friendship</i>
<i>into a horrible pre-marital situation.</i>

20:00.842 --> 20:04.837
<i>This led directly to the Old Testament.</i>

20:06.850 --> 20:10.853
<i>Two Old Testament books, in particular...</i>

20:10.854 --> 20:14.848
<i>...included advice on romantic matters,</i>
<i>some of it, very tough.</i>

20:29.876 --> 20:33.880
<i>After what happened with Betty,</i>
<i>I resolved not to sleep with any girl...</i>

20:33.881 --> 20:37.876
<i>...until I met the one I wanted to marry</i>
<i>and spend the rest of my life with.</i>

20:42.893 --> 20:46.885
<i>I had no idea if I'd meet such a person</i>
<i>or if she existed, plain or not.</i>

20:51.902 --> 20:55.897
<i>My aspiration was to free romance</i>
<i>from the chains of beauty and carnality...</i>

20:56.909 --> 21:00.903
<i>...and stop doing harm.</i>

21:21.938 --> 21:24.941
What's going on?

21:24.942 --> 21:26.944
What are you doing here?

21:26.945 --> 21:29.947
Is this some strange Glenn Miller-based
religious ceremony?

21:29.948 --> 21:31.949
No, Presbyterian.

21:31.950 --> 21:33.952
Is this your Presbyterian church?

21:33.953 --> 21:35.954
Well, Protestant.

21:35.955 --> 21:39.958
- Protestant churches are like this?
- Pretty much.

21:39.959 --> 21:43.963
I didn't get a chance
to change any money today.

21:43.964 --> 21:46.966
- How much?
- Would $100 be possible?

21:46.967 --> 21:50.972
Actually, I don't have it on me.
I'm waiting for a transfer.

21:50.973 --> 21:53.976
If you want to borrow 10,000 pesetas,
just say so.

21:53.977 --> 21:56.979
- I can give you a check for it.
- I'd like the money back.

21:56.980 --> 22:00.974
Of course.

22:01.986 --> 22:05.979
- You'll get it back.
- Sure.

22:16.001 --> 22:19.996
<i>What made my isolation bearable</i>
<i>was my work for IHSMOCO...</i>

22:21.008 --> 22:25.013
<i>...the Illinois High-Speed</i>
<i>Motor Corporation.</i>

22:25.014 --> 22:27.015
<i>Like everyone,</i>
<i>I'd seen Arthur Miller's play...</i>

22:27.016 --> 22:31.010
<i>...and, as a youth, had the usual</i>
<i>deprecating attitude to business and sales.</i>

22:33.022 --> 22:37.016
<i>That changed when Professor Thompson's</i>
<i>business course convinced us...</i>

22:38.028 --> 22:42.022
<i>...that even the mundane world of business</i>
<i>had its romance.</i>

22:43.034 --> 22:47.038
<i>A job interview with IHSMOCO led</i>
<i>to employment and its training program.</i>

22:47.039 --> 22:51.032
<i>I arrived in sales just as</i>
<i>the flu epidemic struck and never left.</i>

22:54.047 --> 22:57.050
<i>In sales I found not just a job,</i>
<i>but a culture.</i>

22:57.051 --> 23:00.053
<i>Franklin, Emerson, Carnegie and Bettger</i>
<i>were our philosophers...</i>

23:00.054 --> 23:04.059
<i>...and thanks to Carnegie's</i>
<i>theory of human relations...</i>

23:04.060 --> 23:06.061
<i>...many customers also became friends.</i>

23:06.062 --> 23:10.065
I don't consider high-pressure sales
sales at all. It's a form of fraud.

23:10.066 --> 23:13.068
In true sales, you provide a real
and constructive service...

23:13.069 --> 23:17.074
...help people improve their lives
or make companies more efficient...

23:17.075 --> 23:19.076
...and so create wonderful economies
of scale...

23:19.077 --> 23:22.080
...from which everyone
and the whole economy benefit.

23:22.081 --> 23:26.084
<i>The classic literature of self-improvement</i>
<i>really was improving.</i>

23:26.085 --> 23:30.088
Here's something good.
It's Bettger quoting George Adams:

23:30.089 --> 23:34.093
'The wisest and best salesman
bluntly tells the truth about his article.'

23:34.094 --> 23:36.096
'That is always impressive.'

23:36.097 --> 23:39.100
/ If he does not sell the first time,
he leaves a trail of trust behind.'

23:39.101 --> 23:43.095
'Being bluntly honest is always safe
and best.'

23:44.106 --> 23:48.111
<i>Other books, magazines, and tapes</i>
<i>mixed practical tips with home truths.</i>

23:48.112 --> 23:52.115
<i>Each time you handle a paper,</i>
<i>mark it with a red dot.</i>

23:52.116 --> 23:55.119
<i>If you encounter papers</i>
<i>with three or four dots...</i>

23:55.120 --> 23:57.121
<i>...you could work more efficiently.</i>

23:57.122 --> 24:00.125
<i>Try to dispose of each paper</i>
<i>the first time you handle it.</i>

24:00.126 --> 24:03.127
<i>The enthusiastic tone</i>
<i>of much of this literature...</i>

24:03.128 --> 24:06.131
<i>...did open it up to the ridicule of half-wits.</i>

24:06.132 --> 24:10.125
Maybe I could use these same techniques
in my Navy career.

24:11.138 --> 24:15.133
'Every day, in every way, I'm becoming
a better and better lieutenant.'

24:16.146 --> 24:20.138
That's autosuggestion,
popularized by Coué, but totally unserious.

24:21.150 --> 24:25.154
What I'm talking about,
has nothing to do with that.

24:25.155 --> 24:29.159
<i>I loved coming into the office early</i>
<i>to catch up on the overnight telex traffic.</i>

24:29.160 --> 24:32.162
<i>The telex was our umbilical cord</i>
<i>to Chicago...</i>

24:32.163 --> 24:35.166
<i>...and confirmations for bigger sales</i>
<i>came through it, too.</i>

24:35.167 --> 24:36.167
What's wrong?

24:36.168 --> 24:40.161
- Dickie Taylor's going to supervise sales.
- The Dickie Taylor of Marketing?

24:42.174 --> 24:45.178
I can't believe it. Work for that guy?

24:45.179 --> 24:48.182
I'm sure he's going to get me fired.

24:48.183 --> 24:52.177
No. You are the best they have.
They cannot do that.

24:59.195 --> 25:03.199
<i>I really looked forward to seeing Aurora</i>
<i>that night.</i>

25:03.200 --> 25:07.194
<i>I had this image of looking into her eyes</i>
<i>and seeing her soul.</i>

25:15.214 --> 25:19.208
<i>But she was late, which was actually</i>
<i>not that common in Barcelona.</i>

25:22.222 --> 25:23.222
Oh, it's you.

25:23.223 --> 25:27.218
Aurora can't come.
Please excuse my retard.

25:35.238 --> 25:37.239
Two weeks ago Aurora had a <i>flechazo.</i>

25:37.240 --> 25:39.241
What's a <i>flechazo</i> ?

25:39.242 --> 25:43.247
It means dropping crazily
in love with someone...

25:43.248 --> 25:47.252
...as if an arrow had entered your heart,
shot by one of those little boy angels.

25:47.253 --> 25:51.255
Aurora had a crazy adventure
with this man, but he got too serious.

25:51.256 --> 25:55.260
- She wanted an adventure with you.
- An adventure?

25:55.261 --> 25:57.262
But her boyfriend got angry
and pressured her.

25:57.263 --> 26:01.258
- Aurora has a boyfriend?
- Yes.

26:02.270 --> 26:04.272
'Vinyl Hampton.'

26:04.273 --> 26:07.274
I was sure that Aurora said,
'Lionel Hampton.'

26:07.275 --> 26:11.270
I've never heard of Vinyl Hampton.

26:23.295 --> 26:25.295
How could you tell I felt that way?

26:25.296 --> 26:29.290
During the whole concert,
your expression was like this.

26:30.302 --> 26:32.304
- You're very perceptive.
- What?

26:32.305 --> 26:35.308
- You're very perceptive.
- What?

26:35.309 --> 26:39.314
You are very perceptive.

26:39.315 --> 26:43.308
- Thank you.
- I don't like perceptiveness of that kind.

26:48.324 --> 26:50.326
<i>It's a typical pretty-girl thing...</i>

26:50.327 --> 26:54.321
...using observation for ridicule,
as if impertinence were cute and charming.

26:56.334 --> 26:58.335
My impression of Aurora is...

26:58.336 --> 27:02.339
...that she'd be more apt to use
observation for comprehension.

27:02.340 --> 27:05.342
- You don't think Aurora's pretty?
- No.

27:05.343 --> 27:08.347
But she's beautiful.

27:08.348 --> 27:10.349
- Physically?
- Yes.

27:10.350 --> 27:13.354
- Her eyes <i>...</i>
- She's beautiful because of her eyes?

27:13.355 --> 27:14.355
Yes.

27:14.356 --> 27:18.359
She also has a beautiful <i>...</i>

27:18.360 --> 27:21.362
- Figure?
- Yes.

27:21.363 --> 27:25.357
Apparently, you are just the sort
of dangerous, foreign man she likes.

27:26.369 --> 27:28.371
What do you mean?

27:28.372 --> 27:30.373
Your brother told her about your interests.

27:30.374 --> 27:32.375
- What?
- You know?

27:32.376 --> 27:33.376
No.

27:33.377 --> 27:37.381
The Marquis de Sade, games of leather,
weekends of fun.

27:37.382 --> 27:39.384
The straps under your clothes.

27:39.385 --> 27:40.385
He said that?

27:40.386 --> 27:42.387
That's completely untrue.

27:42.388 --> 27:45.391
He promised
he wouldn't say that anymore.

27:45.392 --> 27:48.395
He's not my brother.

27:48.396 --> 27:51.399
You don't know anything
about the Marquis de Sade?

27:51.400 --> 27:53.401
No.

27:53.402 --> 27:57.395
I don't believe you.

28:02.412 --> 28:06.416
So you're not wearing them tonight.
That doesn't prove anything.

28:06.417 --> 28:10.411
Maybe they're at the cleaners.

28:13.425 --> 28:17.428
<i>It turned out we both loved</i>
<i>disco music of the late 1970s...</i>

28:17.429 --> 28:21.433
<i>...despite what everyone else thought.</i>

28:21.434 --> 28:23.436
<i>We talked about all kinds of things.</i>

28:23.437 --> 28:27.441
You know how at parties
people talk about marketing?

28:27.442 --> 28:28.442
No.

28:28.443 --> 28:31.446
I've never heard people at a party
talk about marketing.

28:31.447 --> 28:34.449
This idea of marketing being a science.

28:34.450 --> 28:38.444
If you look at the evidence,
it's all anecdotal.

28:41.459 --> 28:44.461
<i>It was during a Donna Summer song</i>
<i>that it happened...</i>

28:44.462 --> 28:48.455
<i>...or that I realized it had.</i>

28:54.473 --> 28:58.468
<i>Everything was completely different now.</i>

29:04.487 --> 29:06.487
The things they say about us.

29:06.488 --> 29:09.490
I know we're not to take it seriously,
but it really hurts.

29:09.491 --> 29:10.492
I don't believe you!

29:10.493 --> 29:14.486
Once, I'd like to date a girl not certain
I'm wearing black leather underwear.

29:16.500 --> 29:17.500
That bothers you?

29:17.501 --> 29:21.495
- The exact same story over and over!
- It's not exactly the same. I vary it a little.

29:22.507 --> 29:26.499
Great! It wasn't Aurora, but this
terrific friend of hers from the Trade Fair.

29:27.512 --> 29:31.516
She's never met you
but was still full of your stupid stories.

29:31.517 --> 29:35.522
Frankly, I don't care for your tone.

29:35.523 --> 29:38.526
You should thank God you have a cousin
who makes up interesting stories.

29:38.527 --> 29:41.528
I'm the best P.R. Guy you'll ever have.

29:41.529 --> 29:44.532
Do you think any cool Trade Fair girl
would give you the time of day...

29:44.533 --> 29:48.526
...if she knew the pathetic Bible-dancing
goody-goody you are?

29:49.539 --> 29:52.541
You're far weirder than someone merely
into S & M.

29:52.542 --> 29:53.542
At least they have a tradition.

29:53.543 --> 29:56.546
We have an idea what S and M is,
from movies and books.

29:56.547 --> 30:00.541
But there is nothing to explain
the way you are.

30:30.588 --> 30:34.581
Hi, Ted. Go to the front
and we will come down.

30:44.603 --> 30:47.607
Haven't you noticed the way he makes digs
at my intelligence?

30:47.608 --> 30:49.609
No.

30:49.610 --> 30:51.612
In the US,
we take these tests called College Boards...

30:51.613 --> 30:54.615
...to go to a university
that's selective, highly selective...

30:54.616 --> 30:57.619
...or not at all selective,
which is where I went.

30:57.620 --> 30:59.621
My Board scores were bad.

30:59.622 --> 31:01.623
You seem very intelligent for an American.

31:01.624 --> 31:04.627
Well, I'm not.

31:04.628 --> 31:08.632
The worst part was Ted
getting 800 Boards, perfect scores.

31:08.633 --> 31:12.635
I've met other people with 800 Boards
and they didn't seem intelligent either.

31:12.636 --> 31:16.630
- So Ted is very smart.
- He tests well.

31:25.654 --> 31:28.655
I think it's true that the height
of the sexual revolution is over.

31:28.656 --> 31:30.657
I don't go to bed
with just anyone anymore...

31:30.658 --> 31:33.661
...I have to be attracted to them sexually.

31:33.662 --> 31:37.666
I thought women had to have
an emotional bond with a man.

31:37.667 --> 31:41.670
A secure, romantic relationship,
before they became interested...

31:41.671 --> 31:43.673
...in a relation of that kind.

31:43.674 --> 31:47.666
Oh, no.

31:50.681 --> 31:54.686
Using his position to get involved
with a 15-year old student?

31:54.687 --> 31:58.691
Nothing really happened until summer.
By then I was 16.

31:58.692 --> 31:59.693
Oh, well, 16 <i>...</i>

31:59.694 --> 32:02.696
Also, I had something to do with it.

32:02.697 --> 32:06.700
Still. Just from the little you've said.
I really hate that guy.

32:06.701 --> 32:10.695
In truth, much of what you say
reminds me of Ramon then.

32:11.707 --> 32:14.709
Ramon soon left from teaching
to return to the newspaper.

32:14.710 --> 32:17.713
He had read the works of Philip Agee...

32:17.714 --> 32:20.717
...so he was an expert
on the American CIA...

32:20.718 --> 32:23.720
...and its involvement
in the internal affairs of every country.

32:23.721 --> 32:24.721
Terrific.

32:24.722 --> 32:28.726
One year, the correspondent of fashion
of his newspaper fell ill...

32:28.727 --> 32:32.730
...before the Milan collections
and Ramon was sent in her place.

32:32.731 --> 32:36.736
Ramon came back from Milan
with a new idea...

32:36.737 --> 32:40.740
...which he referred to
as the 'idea of physical beauty.'

32:40.741 --> 32:42.742
What's that?

32:42.743 --> 32:44.745
His thought was that...

32:44.746 --> 32:48.750
...beauty is the closest thing to divinity
in the modern world.

32:48.751 --> 32:51.754
All the old gods are dead.
There is no God that we know.

32:51.755 --> 32:55.759
But in beauty,
the memory of divinity remains.

32:55.760 --> 32:56.760
For always after...

32:56.761 --> 33:00.753
...beauty was the subject Ramon
wanted to dedicate his journalism to.

33:01.766 --> 33:04.768
He wanted to write about
flowers and things?

33:04.769 --> 33:06.770
No.

33:06.771 --> 33:10.766
It was the beauty of the female face
and form that fascinated Ramon.

33:13.781 --> 33:17.784
He transferred to the Style of Life
section of the newspaper...

33:17.785 --> 33:20.788
...where he did series
on photographer's models...

33:20.789 --> 33:23.791
...and on the young women
who aspire to be actresses.

33:23.792 --> 33:27.796
The articles were accompanied by photos,
and, as Ramon is a good writer...

33:27.797 --> 33:30.800
...they were very popular with readers.

33:30.801 --> 33:31.801
That makes sense.

33:31.802 --> 33:35.795
There's something powerful
about the idea of physical beauty.

33:36.807 --> 33:38.808
He's not stupid.

33:38.809 --> 33:42.813
It was important for Ramon's career
as a journalist.

33:42.814 --> 33:44.815
He started appearing on television.

33:44.816 --> 33:48.812
He spent part of each month in Madrid.

33:49.824 --> 33:53.827
But, our physical relation ended
almost completely.

33:53.828 --> 33:57.832
He wanted an open relation
and encouraged me to go with other men.

33:57.833 --> 33:58.833
What?

33:58.834 --> 34:02.837
- He thought I should go with other men.
- But you refused.

34:02.838 --> 34:04.840
No.

34:04.841 --> 34:07.843
When did you break up?

34:07.844 --> 34:11.837
- 'Break up' ?
- Separate. Break apart as a couple.

34:12.849 --> 34:15.853
We haven't broken apart.

34:15.853 --> 34:19.847
We live together.

34:31.873 --> 34:35.876
- Jesus, what was that?
- I don't know.

34:35.877 --> 34:39.871
That's where the USO is.

34:43.888 --> 34:47.880
<i>A sailor from Brooklyn died</i>
<i>in the USO bombing.</i>

34:49.893 --> 34:51.895
<i>Fred thought we should wait</i>
<i>with the sailor's friend...</i>

34:51.896 --> 34:55.889
<i>...for the midnight plane</i>
<i>that was going to take the casket home.</i>

34:56.902 --> 35:00.907
He had a good voice. Very deep.
He liked to sing old Johnny Cash songs.

35:00.908 --> 35:04.910
I really like those <i>. Ring of Fire.</i>

35:04.911 --> 35:08.905
- He hoped to be a Brooklyn Johnny Cash.
- What a shame.

35:09.917 --> 35:12.921
- Johnny Cash?
- Yeah.

35:12.922 --> 35:15.924
Where'd you get the Old Crow?

35:15.925 --> 35:16.926
The Consul.

35:16.927 --> 35:20.919
So he's not such a bad guy.

35:21.931 --> 35:25.925
We should get started.

35:33.947 --> 35:37.940
'Our Father, preserve us from the dangers
of the seas and the violence of enemies.'

35:38.951 --> 35:40.954
'Bless the United States.'

35:40.955 --> 35:42.956
'Watch over those upon the deep...'

35:42.957 --> 35:46.951
'<i>'...</i> and protect the inhabitants of the land
in peace and quiet.

35:55.972 --> 35:59.965
'All hands bury the dead.'

36:02.980 --> 36:04.981
'Unto Almighty God...'

36:04.982 --> 36:08.978
<i>'...we commend the soul
of our brother departed.'</i>

36:32.014 --> 36:35.016
There are many parties tonight.
At least three we should go to.

36:35.017 --> 36:37.019
- Three parties?
- Or four.

36:37.020 --> 36:39.022
Will that guy be at any of them?

36:39.023 --> 36:43.017
I'm sure.

36:56.043 --> 36:59.046
- That guy's here.
- Yes.

36:59.047 --> 37:03.040
- Want to go?
- No.

37:07.057 --> 37:10.059
You can't say Americans are not
more violent than other people?

37:10.060 --> 37:11.060
No!

37:11.061 --> 37:14.063
All those people killed in shootings
in America?

37:14.064 --> 37:18.068
Shootings. That doesn't mean Americans
are more violent than other people.

37:18.069 --> 37:20.071
We're just better shots.

37:20.072 --> 37:23.075
Jack refocused IHSMOCO
on what he saw as its real business.

37:23.076 --> 37:26.077
<i>'This means motors
and they must be fast,'</i> he'd say.

37:26.078 --> 37:30.072
Jack's one of those magnetic personalities
from the World War II generation.

37:31.084 --> 37:33.086
He was with Wild Bill Donovan
in the OSS...

37:33.087 --> 37:36.090
...and parachuted into Sicily
before the Allied landings.

37:36.091 --> 37:40.095
He's supposed to come to Barcelona
this summer. I hope you can meet him.

37:40.096 --> 37:42.097
Why should I meet him?

37:42.098 --> 37:45.100
He's one of the last of the greats.

37:45.101 --> 37:49.104
It's wonderful having work you like
and a boss you admire.

37:49.105 --> 37:52.108
Lately, there have been some problems.
I don't know what's going on.

37:52.109 --> 37:56.104
I haven't heard from Jack
and he's put this terrible guy over us.

37:57.116 --> 38:00.118
Dickie Taylor.
He's this incredible jerk who...

38:00.119 --> 38:01.119
Jesus!

38:01.120 --> 38:03.122
- What's wrong?
- This music.

38:03.123 --> 38:07.127
- How can anybody dance to this?
- It's not dance music.

38:07.128 --> 38:09.129
That explains it.

38:09.130 --> 38:11.131
What is it? It sounds familiar.

38:11.132 --> 38:14.135
- It's Vinyl Hampton.
- Oh, God.

38:14.136 --> 38:17.138
Isn't there dancing at parties here?

38:17.139 --> 38:21.142
It's too early for dancing.

38:21.143 --> 38:25.147
- You don't like jazz?
- No.

38:25.148 --> 38:28.150
I've never heard of anyone
who didn't like jazz.

38:28.151 --> 38:31.154
Really? How odd.

38:31.155 --> 38:33.158
You really hate jazz?

38:33.159 --> 38:37.152
My jazz rule is: If you can't dance to it,
you don't want to know about it.

38:40.167 --> 38:44.160
Come on.

38:45.172 --> 38:49.166
Come on.

39:16.209 --> 39:18.210
This is almost impossible to do.

39:18.211 --> 39:22.205
I always forget that. Maybe it is too early.

39:29.225 --> 39:33.228
Take hamburgers.
Here, <i>hamburguesas</i> are really bad.

39:33.229 --> 39:37.233
It's known that Americans like hamburgers,
so again, we're idiots.

39:37.234 --> 39:41.237
But they have no idea
how delicious hamburgers can be.

39:41.238 --> 39:43.240
It's this ideal burger of memory we crave...

39:43.241 --> 39:46.244
...not the disgusting burgers
you get abroad.

39:46.245 --> 39:48.246
We can't even call ourselves Americans.

39:48.247 --> 39:51.249
They love to correct you, saying,
'South Americans are Americans too.'

39:51.250 --> 39:55.254
- Give me a break.
- <i>Norte americano</i> is the correct term.

39:55.255 --> 39:59.260
But that makes no distinction
between us or Canadians.

39:59.261 --> 40:02.263
'Yankee' and <i>'Gringo'</i>
are obviously pejorative...

40:02.264 --> 40:06.267
...but it's the standard dictionary term
that's the most insulting <i>. Estadounidense.</i>

40:06.268 --> 40:08.269
Dense.

40:08.270 --> 40:09.270
D-E-N-S-E.

40:09.271 --> 40:11.273
It's the same spelling. Dense.
Thick, stupid.

40:11.274 --> 40:15.277
Every time you hear it, <i>Estadouni</i>- dense.
It's a direct slap in the face. Incredible.

40:15.278 --> 40:18.281
You're too sensitive.

40:18.282 --> 40:22.277
Great! Now we're too sensitive!

40:31.298 --> 40:34.301
Fred, listen. I'm sorry. Are you joking?

40:34.302 --> 40:36.303
You weren't really offended by that,
were you?

40:36.304 --> 40:40.308
- I like being called dishonest.
- I did not call you dishonest.

40:40.309 --> 40:43.310
When we were kids,
I borrowed some things.

40:43.311 --> 40:46.314
It was never, ever theft.
I either told you or was about to.

40:46.315 --> 40:50.309
I was joking. You're really overreacting.

40:51.321 --> 40:53.322
You're right. I somewhat overreacted.

40:53.323 --> 40:57.319
Before I realized it, I was already out
the door and too embarrassed to go back.

40:58.331 --> 41:02.334
- The coffee's strange here.
- In Barcelona?

41:02.335 --> 41:04.336
It's really messed me up.

41:04.337 --> 41:06.338
You were so condescending.

41:06.339 --> 41:10.343
You think I went into the Navy
because I washed out at Shearson.

41:10.344 --> 41:13.347
- I don't know what happened in New York.
- I didn't wash out.

41:13.348 --> 41:17.351
There was no disgrace.
They said I could go back.

41:17.352 --> 41:21.355
I dreaded 40 years stuck indoors with
two weeks to go snorkeling annually.

41:21.356 --> 41:23.358
A Naval officer has the rare job...

41:23.359 --> 41:27.363
...that deals with the physical world
all day, and it counts.

41:27.364 --> 41:29.365
It is not theoretical.

41:29.366 --> 41:32.370
You dominate the elements
in four dimensions without a slip-up...

41:32.371 --> 41:35.373
...or it gets very wet.

41:35.374 --> 41:39.377
And all that fighting for freedom,
defending democracy, shining stuff...

41:39.378 --> 41:41.380
...which as you know, I really buy.

41:41.381 --> 41:45.384
Jesus. That's right. You do.

41:45.385 --> 41:49.379
The bill has come.

41:51.392 --> 41:55.396
Must have been like this, the night
F. Key wrote the <i>Star-Spangled Banner.</i>

41:55.397 --> 41:59.391
Yeah.

42:00.403 --> 42:04.407
- You have already finished?
- Yeah, it's like 2:00 a.m.

42:04.408 --> 42:07.411
Ramon was talking so fascinatingly,
I stayed to listen.

42:07.412 --> 42:10.415
What was so fascinating?

42:10.416 --> 42:14.408
He was talking about the AFL-CIA
and the American labor unions.

42:16.422 --> 42:20.427
He described how, after World War II,
men from the American labor union...

42:20.428 --> 42:24.431
...the AFL-CIA were sent to Europe
to crush progressive unionism.

42:24.432 --> 42:26.434
How'd they do that?

42:26.435 --> 42:30.437
With sacks of money and the
anti-Communist tactics of Joe McCarthy.

42:30.438 --> 42:32.440
The AFL-CIA?

42:32.441 --> 42:35.443
America's largest union,
terribly right wing and <i>facha.</i>

42:35.444 --> 42:37.446
You have not heard of it?

42:37.447 --> 42:41.440
It's amazing the things Americans
don't know about their country.

42:42.453 --> 42:46.457
There's no such thing as the AFL-CIA.

42:46.458 --> 42:48.458
It's the AFL-CIO.

42:48.459 --> 42:51.463
Actually, it's the A.F. Of L.C.I.O.

42:51.464 --> 42:55.458
It was formed when the AFL merged
with the more militant CIO.

42:56.470 --> 42:58.471
How do you know so much about it?

42:58.472 --> 43:01.475
Chicago is the capital of 20th century
American trade-unionism.

43:01.476 --> 43:05.469
The American labor leaders
who came to Europe, Jay Lovestone and <i>...</i>

43:07.482 --> 43:08.482
...were giants.

43:08.483 --> 43:10.484
So what Marta said was partly true.

43:10.485 --> 43:14.489
What do you mean, 'partly true' ?
They were people.

43:14.490 --> 43:18.486
I'm sure I've heard of the AFL-CIA.
It's some important American labor union.

43:26.505 --> 43:30.499
So now it's late enough to dance.

43:38.519 --> 43:42.522
There's an empty room
where you could work during the day.

43:42.523 --> 43:45.526
Are you proposing we shake up together?

43:45.527 --> 43:46.528
Shack up together.

43:46.529 --> 43:50.532
You use 'shacked up' when you don't like
one of the people involved.

43:50.533 --> 43:54.528
You and Ramon were shacked up.
We'd be living together.

43:57.543 --> 43:59.543
What about Fred?

43:59.544 --> 44:03.538
He's moving out.

44:09.556 --> 44:13.550
- She's a model he was interviewing.
- He's just all work. The creep.

44:15.564 --> 44:19.557
Ramon might not be as bad as you think.
There's a reason he has so many women.

44:20.569 --> 44:23.571
- He has a problem.
- What?

44:23.572 --> 44:27.566
After he knows a woman well,
he can't have sex with her well.

44:28.578 --> 44:32.583
He has a sexual impotence problem
of some kind?

44:32.584 --> 44:34.584
- Of some kind.
- That's terrible.

44:34.585 --> 44:35.585
Poor guy.

44:35.586 --> 44:38.589
- It explains a lot.
- What?

44:38.590 --> 44:42.594
It's well-known that anti-Americanism
has its roots in sexual impotence.

44:42.595 --> 44:45.598
At least, in Europe.

44:45.599 --> 44:48.602
There's no union called the AFL-CIA,
is there?

44:48.603 --> 44:52.595
- No.
- Give me a break.

44:53.608 --> 44:57.601
This bombing reminds one strongly
of the US blowing up its own ship.

44:58.614 --> 44:59.614
The <i>Maine...</i>

44:59.615 --> 45:03.608
...in Havana harbor as the pretext
for starting the War of 1898.

45:04.621 --> 45:07.624
An American sailor died in the bombing.

45:07.625 --> 45:11.629
It's hard for me to believe even
the Americans would kill their own people.

45:11.630 --> 45:12.630
No.

45:12.631 --> 45:15.634
The American elections are approaching.

45:15.635 --> 45:18.637
A quick attack
on some foreign bogeyman...

45:18.638 --> 45:22.632
...Libya or Iran, might rescue the American
president's reclining popularity.

45:23.644 --> 45:25.645
The American 6th Fleet...

45:25.646 --> 45:28.648
...which was to have
shown the pendant here this week...

45:28.649 --> 45:32.643
...is still sailing the South Mediterranean,
awaiting such a pretext.

45:33.655 --> 45:36.657
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah. Poor guy.

45:36.658 --> 45:40.663
The most disgusting slanders!
Someone's gotta say something.

45:40.664 --> 45:41.665
No, don't.

45:41.666 --> 45:44.669
This scumbag is going around saying...

45:44.670 --> 45:48.672
...that the USO bombing was arranged
by the Americans themselves.

45:48.673 --> 45:51.676
That's a lie!

45:51.677 --> 45:52.677
What?

45:52.678 --> 45:54.679
Everything you said.

45:54.680 --> 45:58.684
The Americans exploding their own ship,
the <i>Maine</i>, in 1898...

45:58.685 --> 46:00.687
...is a historical fact, established well.

46:00.688 --> 46:04.680
The other is still a thesis,
but an increasingly likely one.

46:05.692 --> 46:07.694
Both are disgusting lies.

46:07.695 --> 46:11.689
No, Ted. All the history books
say that about the <i>Maine.</i>

46:13.703 --> 46:14.703
Scumbag.

46:14.704 --> 46:16.705
I'm the one who's supposed to go berserk.

46:16.706 --> 46:20.711
- You could've helped me out.
- I can't get into political arguments.

46:20.712 --> 46:21.711
- You did fine.
- Yeah.

46:21.712 --> 46:25.716
I made a complete fool of myself.
It's one of the first rules of sales:

46:25.717 --> 46:29.721
'Never get involved in matters of public
controversy.' But I couldn't not reply.

46:29.722 --> 46:33.725
No. Don't get into a funk about it.
Who was really listening?

46:33.726 --> 46:36.729
- Four or five good timers at some party.
- Twenty people, at least.

46:36.730 --> 46:40.724
So you made a fool of yourself
in front of 20 or 30 people. So what?

47:00.758 --> 47:03.761
No, I really like it here.
I'm really comfortable.

47:03.762 --> 47:06.765
We talked about you staying three days.
It's been much longer.

47:06.766 --> 47:10.770
I thought with the fleet delayed
you'd want another place to stay.

47:10.771 --> 47:11.771
No.

47:11.772 --> 47:13.773
This is nice.

47:13.774 --> 47:17.777
The thing is,
I'm trying to get Montserrat to move in.

47:17.778 --> 47:20.781
That's great. I really like Montserrat.

47:20.782 --> 47:24.775
- Won't you think of staying at Marta's?
- No.

47:25.788 --> 47:29.792
Since being here, I've begun to realize
how important family is.

47:29.793 --> 47:32.795
You and I are family.
I want to be with family now.

47:32.796 --> 47:35.799
I want to be with Montserrat.

47:35.800 --> 47:38.803
I'm really surprised at you
shacking up with her.

47:38.804 --> 47:42.798
I would have thought
that was against your morals.

47:44.811 --> 47:48.805
You really want me out of here, don't you?

47:57.825 --> 48:00.828
I still need to pick up my music
from his apartment.

48:00.829 --> 48:04.834
- What music?
- My radio cassette and tapes of music.

48:04.835 --> 48:08.838
The situation is still raw.
You really need those things urgently?

48:08.839 --> 48:10.841
I really need them urgently.

48:10.842 --> 48:14.835
It seems unwise to go back so soon
after you broke apart.

48:15.847 --> 48:19.851
What does that mean?

48:19.852 --> 48:23.846
Suit yourself.

49:11.913 --> 49:12.914
Who's the girl?

49:12.915 --> 49:15.917
She's a girl from the fair
who wants to be an actress.

49:15.918 --> 49:17.920
What a creep.

49:17.921 --> 49:20.923
What this is about is a big country,
the United States...

49:20.924 --> 49:23.927
...making war on a little country.

49:23.928 --> 49:27.931
In the US government's view,
which I'm not in any way endorsing...

49:27.932 --> 49:29.935
...the US policy is <i>...</i>

49:29.936 --> 49:32.938
Maybe this will help. Take these ants.

49:32.939 --> 49:35.942
In the US view, a small group,
or cadre, of fierce red ants...

49:35.943 --> 49:39.935
...have taken power and are oppressing
the black ant majority.

49:40.948 --> 49:42.949
The stated US policy
is to aid those black ants...

49:42.950 --> 49:45.952
...opposing the red ants,
in hopes of restoring democracy...

49:45.953 --> 49:49.947
...and to stop the red ants from assisting
comrades in neighboring ant colonies.

49:50.959 --> 49:54.954
That is the clearest and most disgusting
description of US policy I've ever heard.

49:56.966 --> 49:59.970
The Third World is just a lot of ants to you.

49:59.971 --> 50:01.972
Those are people dying, not ants!

50:01.973 --> 50:04.976
You don't understand.
I was reducing everything to ant scale.

50:04.977 --> 50:07.979
The US included. An ant White House...

50:07.980 --> 50:09.982
...an ant CIA, an ant Congress,
an ant Pentagon.

50:09.983 --> 50:13.985
Secret ant landing strips...

50:13.986 --> 50:15.988
...illegally established on foreign soil.

50:15.989 --> 50:19.982
- Where are the red ants?
- There.

50:30.007 --> 50:33.009
- That was terrible.
- You're blowing it way out of proportion.

50:33.010 --> 50:36.012
Those red ants were bad news.
They weren't good for anybody.

50:36.013 --> 50:39.016
I was trying to convince them
to look at Americans in a new way.

50:39.017 --> 50:42.019
Then, in one stupid move,
you confirm their worst assumptions.

50:42.020 --> 50:46.024
I didn't confirm them,
I am their worst assumption.

50:46.025 --> 50:50.028
- Now Ramon is certain you are CIA.
- 'Where are the red ants? '

50:50.029 --> 50:53.031
It was a joke!

50:53.032 --> 50:57.027
I won't apologize.
The little bastards got what they deserved.

51:10.053 --> 51:14.047
<i>Montserrat decided to ride back</i>
<i>with Ramon to pick up her things.</i>

51:22.067 --> 51:26.061
Thanks.

52:15.130 --> 52:19.124
<i>Montserrat called at 8:00 the next morning,</i>
<i>but I'd already left for the office.</i>

52:24.141 --> 52:28.145
Losing a sale doesn't bother me so much.
I'll make other sales.

52:28.146 --> 52:32.150
But there's this thought I can't shake
that's getting me down.

52:32.151 --> 52:36.154
Maybe I'm not cut out for sales.
I thought I liked sales and was good at it.

52:36.155 --> 52:38.156
But maybe I'm not cut out for it.

52:38.157 --> 52:40.158
What exactly is the problem?

52:40.159 --> 52:43.162
Spending your whole life
doing something you're ill-suited to.

52:43.163 --> 52:44.163
Wasting your life.

52:44.164 --> 52:47.167
It's kind of depressing.

52:47.168 --> 52:50.171
God. Maybe I'm not cut out for the Navy.

52:50.172 --> 52:52.174
I gotta get back.

52:52.175 --> 52:56.178
Back to work? For someone not cut out
for something, you're pretty obsessed.

52:56.179 --> 52:58.180
That doesn't mean anything.

52:58.181 --> 53:02.175
- It's okay if I stay another night?
- Sure.

53:08.193 --> 53:12.186
<i>The call from Chicago I'd been dreading,</i>
<i>came that evening.</i>

53:15.200 --> 53:17.203
Okay.

53:17.204 --> 53:19.205
Good-bye.

53:19.206 --> 53:21.208
That was Dickie.

53:21.209 --> 53:24.211
He's coming here to speak with me
but won't say what it's about.

53:24.212 --> 53:26.213
I'm getting canned.

53:26.214 --> 53:29.218
<i>Ramon's article appeared the next day.</i>

53:29.219 --> 53:30.218
It's incredible.

53:30.219 --> 53:33.222
The most disgusting slander.

53:33.223 --> 53:36.225
'Americans themselves
suspected in USO bombing.'

53:36.226 --> 53:39.229
Where do they get this about us
blowing up the <i>Maine</i> ?

53:39.230 --> 53:43.223
I'm going to the Consul.
They've gotta reply to this.

53:46.239 --> 53:50.242
God! I can't believe it!

53:50.243 --> 53:51.243
What?

53:51.244 --> 53:54.246
You're not going to believe this.
The Consul.

53:54.247 --> 53:58.251
That half-bottle of Old Crow.
He accused me of stealing it.

53:58.252 --> 54:00.253
- He gave you that.
- I thought so.

54:00.254 --> 54:03.258
He was on the phone, and I went like this:

54:03.259 --> 54:05.260
I'm sure he indicated it was okay.

54:05.261 --> 54:06.261
You replaced it.

54:06.262 --> 54:10.255
You can't find Old Crow here, so I got
a bottle of Jim Beam, which costs more.

54:11.267 --> 54:13.269
- The bottle in the kitchen?
- Yeah.

54:13.270 --> 54:15.272
You've been drinking that.

54:15.273 --> 54:19.267
I won't replace a half-bottle of Old Crow
with a full Jim Beam. I'm not an idiot.

54:20.279 --> 54:23.281
You haven't replaced it?
Don't you see how bad that looks.

54:23.282 --> 54:25.283
Oh, God, give me a break!

54:25.284 --> 54:29.288
After a while, the line between
borrowing things and theft...

54:29.289 --> 54:31.290
...becomes awfully thin.

54:31.291 --> 54:33.292
Take that back.

54:33.293 --> 54:37.297
Until you retract that,
I'm not going to say another word to you.

54:37.298 --> 54:39.300
Okay.

54:39.301 --> 54:43.295
What you're referring to happened
20 years ago and not as you imply.

54:44.307 --> 54:47.310
Your kayak was a death ship!
I almost went down in it.

54:47.311 --> 54:50.313
Thank God it was me, not you.
I was a stronger swimmer.

54:50.314 --> 54:52.316
I probably saved your life.

54:52.317 --> 54:55.319
Great. It wasn't only the kayak.

54:55.320 --> 54:58.323
You're obsessed
with material possessions!

54:58.324 --> 55:00.324
Maybe the Spanish are right.

55:00.325 --> 55:03.328
This American materialism is terrible.

55:03.329 --> 55:05.330
You're just like the Consul.

55:05.331 --> 55:07.332
More interested in possessions...

55:07.333 --> 55:10.336
...than in answering the most hideously
false and disgusting libel.

55:10.337 --> 55:13.340
- Were you like this at the consulate?
- What's the Consul doing? Nothing.

55:13.341 --> 55:16.345
He doesn't want to jeopardize
his relationship with the press.

55:16.346 --> 55:20.349
You gotta be more careful.
You can't go mouthing off this way.

55:20.350 --> 55:22.351
- Mouthing off?
- Yeah.

55:22.352 --> 55:24.353
These are vile lies.

55:24.354 --> 55:27.357
We know how disgusting they are.
But, nobody here does.

55:27.358 --> 55:30.360
- We've gotta reply to this.
- We?

55:30.361 --> 55:34.365
I drafted a brief letter for your signature.

55:34.366 --> 55:37.368
I can't say,
'The article made me want to vomit.'

55:37.369 --> 55:41.363
Maybe that's not a good way to open.
I could put it at the end.

55:42.376 --> 55:46.369
What are these tiny,
red dots on your papers?

56:04.401 --> 56:05.402
<i>Digui?</i> He's not here.

56:05.403 --> 56:09.397
I just got in. Apparently he isn't home yet.

56:10.409 --> 56:14.412
No, he didn't say anything.

56:14.413 --> 56:18.407
Okay, I'll give him the message.

56:23.424 --> 56:25.425
That was Montserrat.

56:25.426 --> 56:27.429
What's going on there?

56:27.430 --> 56:30.431
- Ted has not said anything?
- No.

56:30.432 --> 56:32.433
He has been in a weird funk.

56:32.434 --> 56:35.437
- It is all his fault.
- Really?

56:35.438 --> 56:39.433
Watch. I am taking one 5,000 peseta note.
You're my witness.

56:40.445 --> 56:43.447
And I'm leaving my signed,
personal IOU for that amount...

56:43.448 --> 56:47.451
...to be repaid within 24 <i>...</i>

56:47.452 --> 56:51.446
Well, 72 hours.

56:52.458 --> 56:54.459
Yes, it is true.

56:54.460 --> 56:56.462
It's actually better this way.

56:56.463 --> 57:00.466
He'd have lent it to me,
but this spares us the acrimony.

57:00.467 --> 57:02.470
Do you mind waiting?
I'll just be a few minutes.

57:02.471 --> 57:06.464
No.

57:11.481 --> 57:12.481
<i>Ramon is very smart.</i>

57:12.482 --> 57:16.486
That evening, on by one, he broke down
all her reasons for leaving him.

57:16.487 --> 57:20.491
First, he's returned to writing
for the paper's international section.

57:20.492 --> 57:22.492
I know. Great.

57:22.493 --> 57:26.497
He pointed up that no matter how well
she and Ted were in Barcelona...

57:26.498 --> 57:30.502
...at some point Ted will return to Chicago,
to him the most beautiful city in the world.

57:30.503 --> 57:33.505
That's crazy. San Francisco is.

57:33.506 --> 57:34.507
Ramon is very persuasive.

57:34.508 --> 57:38.513
He painted a terrible picture of what
it would be like for her to live...

57:38.514 --> 57:41.516
...her life in America
with its crime, consumerism and vulgarity.

57:41.517 --> 57:44.519
All those loud, badly-dressed fat people...

57:44.520 --> 57:47.523
...watching their 80 channels of TV
and visiting shopping malls.

57:47.524 --> 57:51.527
The plastic, throw-everything-away
society with its violence and racism.

57:51.528 --> 57:55.532
And finally, the total lack of culture.

57:55.533 --> 57:56.533
It's a problem.

57:56.534 --> 58:00.537
Ramon's very clever because he never said
anything opposing Ted directly.

58:00.538 --> 58:03.542
He didn't even mention
that thing about the ants.

58:03.543 --> 58:07.536
He pointed out how Montserrat would be
separating from family and friends forever.

58:08.548 --> 58:10.550
Even if she came back every year...

58:10.551 --> 58:13.553
...her children would be Americans,
eating hamburgers.

58:13.554 --> 58:17.558
Finally, Montserrat was sobbing,
what he described was so bleak.

58:17.559 --> 58:21.553
She's dumped Ted and gone back
to Ramon because of some conversation?

58:23.566 --> 58:27.570
That's just it. She just wanted
to have a serious talk with Ted...

58:27.571 --> 58:31.576
...but the way he acted
practically forced her into Ramon's arms.

58:31.577 --> 58:33.577
She is in the arms of Ramon?

58:33.578 --> 58:35.579
No.

58:35.580 --> 58:36.580
I don't know.

58:36.581 --> 58:40.575
When you were in Rhode Island,
was the crime and vulgarity so bad?

58:42.588 --> 58:46.582
Great.

58:54.603 --> 58:57.605
- What's going on?
- I'm getting canned.

58:57.606 --> 59:00.610
But you're the best they've got.
You always say so.

59:00.611 --> 59:04.614
I know. This jerk Dickie Taylor
is calling the shots now.

59:04.615 --> 59:06.617
I don't know how Jack let it happen.

59:06.618 --> 59:09.619
God!

59:09.620 --> 59:11.622
And on top of that thing with Montserrat.

59:11.623 --> 59:13.624
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

59:13.625 --> 59:17.629
Marta said you practically forced her
back into Ramon's arms.

59:17.630 --> 59:19.631
She said that?

59:19.632 --> 59:22.635
I don't know what happened.
Everything was going so well.

59:22.636 --> 59:26.640
Then she never showed up that night
after going for her things at Ramon's.

59:26.641 --> 59:30.635
They talked until dawn
and she slept on his sofa...

59:31.647 --> 59:33.648
...which, for all I know, is true.

59:33.649 --> 59:37.653
Marta said he laid it on thick with
the violence and racism in the USA.

59:37.654 --> 59:41.658
It wouldn't change everything this way.
Something spooked her.

59:41.659 --> 59:45.662
As if I had crowded her.
I was really playing it cool, too.

59:45.663 --> 59:47.664
What makes you think that?

59:47.665 --> 59:50.668
Now she doesn't want to move in.
She wants a serious talk.

59:50.669 --> 59:53.671
- You know what that means.
- You should talk with her.

59:53.672 --> 59:55.673
No. That would be a disaster.

59:55.674 --> 59:59.679
I'd be the jerk crowding her,
whom she had to talk to seriously.

59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.682
But saying you have a work emergency?

01:00:01.683 --> 01:00:03.684
I do.

01:00:03.685 --> 01:00:07.689
- And you're too busy to see her.
- Have you ever heard of Maneuver X?

01:00:07.690 --> 01:00:10.692
When you get deeply into sales,
you realize that...

01:00:10.693 --> 01:00:14.687
...every major transaction involves
a mini identity crisis for the buyer.

01:00:15.699 --> 01:00:19.703
You think, 'A green carpet.
Am I really a green carpet person?'

01:00:19.704 --> 01:00:23.706
In romance, the same thing applies
but on a humongous scale.

01:00:23.707 --> 01:00:24.708
But what is Maneuver X?

01:00:24.709 --> 01:00:27.712
It's removing all pressure.

01:00:27.713 --> 01:00:31.717
Creating a space that the customer
has to affirmatively cross.

01:00:31.718 --> 01:00:35.721
Only by disappearing more thoroughly
and inexplicably than Montserrat...

01:00:35.722 --> 01:00:37.725
...can I change the current dynamic.

01:00:37.726 --> 01:00:40.727
Will it? I don't know. I think it will.

01:00:40.728 --> 01:00:44.732
If not, I'm dead.

01:00:44.733 --> 01:00:48.737
You've thought this through.
That's impressive.

01:00:48.738 --> 01:00:51.740
I haven't thought through anything
about Marta.

01:00:51.741 --> 01:00:55.736
But isn't Maneuver X just another way
of playing hard to get?

01:00:57.748 --> 01:01:01.742
No.

01:01:12.766 --> 01:01:13.767
I'm being followed.

01:01:13.768 --> 01:01:16.770
- Give me a break.
- There is a guy following me.

01:01:16.771 --> 01:01:20.764
Come here, I'll show you.

01:01:21.777 --> 01:01:24.780
Not there. He'll see you. Over here.

01:01:24.781 --> 01:01:27.784
Edge your eyes around.

01:01:27.785 --> 01:01:30.787
He's on that pedestrian island,
a little further down.

01:01:30.788 --> 01:01:32.789
He's in the car?

01:01:32.790 --> 01:01:34.791
What car?

01:01:34.792 --> 01:01:37.794
No. He's gone.

01:01:37.795 --> 01:01:39.797
There really was a guy.

01:01:39.798 --> 01:01:41.799
Wherever I went, he went.

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:45.804
- What did he look like?
- Sort of suspicious-looking.

01:01:45.805 --> 01:01:48.807
- What was he wearing?
- He was carrying something.

01:01:48.808 --> 01:01:52.803
A camera, I think.

01:01:54.816 --> 01:01:58.810
The words to pop songs are about the only
literature of advice we have on romance.

01:01:59.822 --> 01:02:01.824
Most of the advice, very bad.

01:02:01.825 --> 01:02:03.826
Clarify something for me.

01:02:03.827 --> 01:02:06.830
Since I've been waiting for the fleet,
I've read a lot.

01:02:06.831 --> 01:02:08.831
Really?

01:02:08.832 --> 01:02:11.835
One thing that keeps
cropping up is 'subtext.'

01:02:11.836 --> 01:02:14.838
Plays, novels, songs, all have a subtext...

01:02:14.839 --> 01:02:17.842
...which I take to mean
a hidden message or import of some kind.

01:02:17.843 --> 01:02:21.837
Subtext, we know. But what do you call
the message or meaning...

01:02:22.849 --> 01:02:26.853
...that's on the surface, open and obvious?
They never talk about that.

01:02:26.854 --> 01:02:30.848
What do you call
what's above the subtext?

01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:34.863
The text.

01:02:34.864 --> 01:02:38.857
That's right, but they never talk about that.

01:02:45.876 --> 01:02:46.876
Jesus!

01:02:46.877 --> 01:02:50.881
The anti-Americanism here is incredible!

01:02:50.882 --> 01:02:52.884
Oh, my God!

01:02:52.885 --> 01:02:53.885
Jesus!

01:02:53.886 --> 01:02:56.888
'CIA Network Discovered in Barcelona.'

01:02:56.889 --> 01:02:58.891
'Operations Run by Fred Boynton.'

01:02:58.892 --> 01:03:02.886
How can they print this stuff?

01:03:17.915 --> 01:03:21.908
Finally.

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:26.924
God, incredible.

01:03:26.925 --> 01:03:28.926
That was horrible. Blame the victim.

01:03:28.927 --> 01:03:32.931
There was even a call
from the Pentagon, furious.

01:03:32.932 --> 01:03:36.926
This is the worst day of my life.
God, that Consul's annoying!

01:03:38.939 --> 01:03:41.941
That white car's following us.

01:03:41.942 --> 01:03:43.944
- Which car? They're all white.
- The Renault.

01:03:43.945 --> 01:03:45.947
- They're all Renaults.
- Cut it out.

01:03:45.948 --> 01:03:49.952
The white Renault's following me. The last
thing I need is more press coverage.

01:03:49.953 --> 01:03:53.947
It's got Gerona plates.

01:04:05.971 --> 01:04:08.973
Why do you always go to bathrooms
with other people?

01:04:08.974 --> 01:04:10.976
I wasn't born yesterday.

01:04:10.977 --> 01:04:13.979
You were not born yesterday?

01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:16.984
I don't understand you.

01:04:16.985 --> 01:04:19.987
You're not in a very nice mood.

01:04:19.988 --> 01:04:22.991
You gave Ramon that information.

01:04:22.992 --> 01:04:24.993
I didn't know it was of significance.

01:04:24.994 --> 01:04:27.997
Couldn't you tell I was joking?
I'm not in the CIA.

01:04:27.998 --> 01:04:31.990
- It was obviously a joke.
- I have no idea what you are.

01:04:33.003 --> 01:04:37.006
You promised not to repeat to Montserrat
what I said about Ted.

01:04:37.007 --> 01:04:39.009
That he wants to marry her?

01:04:39.010 --> 01:04:43.014
I had to tell her. She already
suspected something like that.

01:04:43.015 --> 01:04:47.019
She was worried about getting
involved with an extremist.

01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:49.021
Extremist?

01:04:49.022 --> 01:04:53.016
It's fascist for a boy to immediately talk
of marrying a woman he likes.

01:04:54.028 --> 01:04:58.022
I don't think Ted is a fascist
of the marrying kind.

01:04:59.034 --> 01:05:03.038
You're right. Something did spook her.
Apparently...

01:05:03.039 --> 01:05:07.032
...I told Marta you wanted to marry
and spend your life with her.

01:05:08.044 --> 01:05:10.045
I never even told you.

01:05:10.046 --> 01:05:14.041
You never confide anything in me,
so I have to extrapolate.

01:05:16.054 --> 01:05:20.058
Why did you tell her?

01:05:20.059 --> 01:05:22.060
You're in this conversation.
It has momentum.

01:05:22.061 --> 01:05:25.064
You want to tell interesting
or funny things.

01:05:25.065 --> 01:05:29.068
You end up telling things,
maybe you shouldn't.

01:05:29.069 --> 01:05:32.072
This was just some 'funny thing.'

01:05:32.073 --> 01:05:35.076
I'd take it back if I could.

01:05:35.077 --> 01:05:39.080
Montserrat's gone to Paris to take
the summer program at the Institute.

01:05:39.081 --> 01:05:43.085
I'm sorry.

01:05:43.086 --> 01:05:47.090
I don't know if this is the right time
to mention this.

01:05:47.091 --> 01:05:50.093
I'm sure it isn't, but...

01:05:50.094 --> 01:05:54.088
...I think I might be in love
with Montserrat, too.

01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:59.094
What if you aren't perfect for each other,
but we are?

01:06:00.106 --> 01:06:02.107
Am I supposed to give up
any possibility of happiness?

01:06:02.108 --> 01:06:06.112
Of ever knowing if she was the one person
I was meant to be with...

01:06:06.113 --> 01:06:08.114
...because accidentally you met her first?

01:06:08.115 --> 01:06:12.120
I hate your guts.

01:06:12.121 --> 01:06:15.124
I know.

01:06:15.125 --> 01:06:19.117
I'll never mention this again.

01:06:24.134 --> 01:06:28.138
I'm going to Milan this morning
and up to Paris on Monday.

01:06:28.139 --> 01:06:31.141
There's some IHSMOCO business there.

01:06:31.142 --> 01:06:33.144
You'll call Montserrat before you go?

01:06:33.145 --> 01:06:36.147
I think I'll just call when I get there.
Play it cool.

01:06:36.148 --> 01:06:40.153
- You're keeping on with Maneuver X?
- Yeah.

01:06:40.154 --> 01:06:43.157
A modified X.

01:06:43.158 --> 01:06:47.161
I borrowed 5,000 pesetas.
Is it okay if I pay you back later?

01:06:47.162 --> 01:06:51.166
You have a bad habit of borrowing things
without informing the lender.

01:06:51.167 --> 01:06:52.167
Sorry.

01:06:52.168 --> 01:06:56.171
'I owe you 5,000 pesetas
to be repaid within 24...'

01:06:56.172 --> 01:07:00.166
<i>'...72 hours. F.'</i>

01:07:01.178 --> 01:07:05.171
- You crossed over into real larceny.
- What?

01:07:08.187 --> 01:07:10.188
I didn't take it.

01:07:10.189 --> 01:07:13.192
I took one 5,000 peseta note.
The rest was all here.

01:07:13.193 --> 01:07:16.195
I don't care. That's enough.

01:07:16.196 --> 01:07:19.199
You can't think I would really steal?

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:23.194
How does it look?

01:07:33.215 --> 01:07:37.210
Bitch.

01:07:44.229 --> 01:07:48.233
I will either get your money back
or I will pay you back myself.

01:07:48.234 --> 01:07:51.237
Good.

01:07:51.238 --> 01:07:55.231
Jesus!

01:08:00.248 --> 01:08:04.253
I don't steal. I didn't take your money.

01:08:04.254 --> 01:08:08.247
You've always been so self-righteous,
ever since we were 10. It's unbearable.

01:08:09.259 --> 01:08:13.253
What happened when we were 10?
You're such a liar.

01:09:49.377 --> 01:09:53.380
Every day, in every way,
I am becoming a better lieutenant.

01:09:53.381 --> 01:09:57.376
Every day, in every way,
I am becoming a better lieutenant.

01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:35.502
<i>Even disasters that strike</i>
<i>those we are closest to...</i>

01:11:35.503 --> 01:11:39.506
<i>...only reach us filtered through</i>
<i>our own colossal egotism.</i>

01:11:39.507 --> 01:11:43.501
<i>My response was swamped</i>
<i>in subjective emotion, mostly guilt.</i>

01:11:44.513 --> 01:11:48.517
<i>I prayed all the time, but with</i>
<i>the constant doubt I was kidding myself.</i>

01:11:48.518 --> 01:11:52.512
<i>I suspected my religious faith</i>
<i>was largely bogus.</i>

01:11:53.525 --> 01:11:56.527
<i>I resolved to stay all the time</i>
<i>and do whatever I could...</i>

01:11:56.528 --> 01:12:00.522
<i>...to improve Fred's chances for recovery.</i>

01:12:03.536 --> 01:12:06.539
<i>Fred was shot before</i>
<i>one of the long summer weekends.</i>

01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:10.534
<i>By late Friday, the entire senior</i>
<i>medical staff seemed to have disappeared.</i>

01:12:13.548 --> 01:12:16.550
I can't believe you're just going?
There must be more you can do.

01:12:16.551 --> 01:12:20.545
Don't worry.
Your buddy will get the best medicine care.

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:27.564
<i>"Don't worry" is the most</i>
<i>frightening phrase in English.</i>

01:12:27.565 --> 01:12:31.558
<i>"Don'd gworry," even more so.</i>

01:12:34.573 --> 01:12:38.566
<i>It means they're not going to worry,</i>
<i>but you better had.</i>

01:12:51.593 --> 01:12:55.587
<i>Each hour Fred remained unconscious,</i>
<i>his chances got worse.</i>

01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:59.601
<i>I had heard that sounds</i>
<i>of familiar voices might help.</i>

01:12:59.602 --> 01:13:03.606
<i>So I kept up a steady stream of chatter</i>
<i>in Fred's room.</i>

01:13:03.607 --> 01:13:06.609
<i>And arranged an around-the-clock vigil</i>
<i>of friends to read to him.</i>

01:13:06.610 --> 01:13:09.612
<i>It was hard to find books in English,</i>
<i>Fred might like.</i>

01:13:09.613 --> 01:13:13.618
'We seek him here, we seek him there.
Those Frenchies seek him everywhere.'

01:13:13.619 --> 01:13:17.613
<i>'Is he in heaven? Is he in hell?
That damned, elusive Pimpernel?'</i>

01:13:18.626 --> 01:13:22.619
<i>It was disillusioning how some people</i>
<i>let you down when someone gets sick.</i>

01:13:23.631 --> 01:13:26.633
It's 9:30, the situation's really bad.

01:13:26.634 --> 01:13:30.628
Why haven't you shown up yet?
You're really needed here.

01:13:32.641 --> 01:13:36.635
<i>Aurora turned out to be a real trooper.</i>

01:13:37.647 --> 01:13:41.641
<i>Marta never showed up.</i>

01:13:43.654 --> 01:13:45.655
<i>The Consul turned out to be a great guy.</i>

01:13:45.656 --> 01:13:47.659
<i>Terrific with the hospital administration.</i>

01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:50.662
<i>He couldn't believe Fred had taken</i>
<i>the Old Crow thing seriously.</i>

01:13:50.663 --> 01:13:52.665
I was just kidding.

01:13:52.666 --> 01:13:55.668
I forgot guys who joke around a lot
can be so sensitive.

01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:59.673
I have no sense of humor
so he must have assumed I was serious.

01:13:59.674 --> 01:14:02.675
<i>Among the Navy guards was</i>
<i>our friend, Frank...</i>

01:14:02.676 --> 01:14:05.679
<i>...who, in his off-duty hours,</i>
<i>helped me with the reading.</i>

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:09.684
<i>'Wherever you are, depravity and evil
are to be found,' said Pierre to his wife.</i>

01:14:09.685 --> 01:14:13.678
<i>'Anatole, come with me. I want
a word with you,' he added in French.'</i>

01:14:14.692 --> 01:14:17.694
<i>Fred and I were so-called "only cousins"...</i>

01:14:17.695 --> 01:14:20.697
<i>...the only cousin each of us had.</i>

01:14:20.698 --> 01:14:23.701
<i>We didn't hate each other</i>
<i>our whole childhood.</i>

01:14:23.702 --> 01:14:27.696
<i>The summer we were 10,</i>
<i>for 36 hours we were on quite good terms.</i>

01:14:28.708 --> 01:14:30.709
<i>After we cut ourselves</i>
<i>in a fishing accident...</i>

01:14:30.710 --> 01:14:34.704
<i>...we used all the blood</i>
<i>to become "blood brothers."</i>

01:14:36.717 --> 01:14:40.720
<i>Later, I went into town with my parents.</i>

01:14:40.721 --> 01:14:44.716
<i>I never saw my kayak again.</i>

01:14:58.743 --> 01:14:59.743
<i>I was expecting Aurora.</i>

01:14:59.744 --> 01:15:03.738
<i>But the nurse said</i>
<i>another woman wanted to speak with me.</i>

01:15:18.767 --> 01:15:22.761
You got my messages.

01:15:30.781 --> 01:15:33.784
We'll go out.
You probably want to be alone with him.

01:15:33.785 --> 01:15:36.787
No. Actually I'm here to see you.

01:15:36.788 --> 01:15:38.789
- Is it about Fred?
- No.

01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:39.791
I'll walk you out.

01:15:39.792 --> 01:15:42.795
You should go home, go to sleep.
You look so tired.

01:15:42.796 --> 01:15:44.797
Greta and I can stay.

01:15:44.798 --> 01:15:46.800
Greta has good English
and loves this book.

01:15:46.801 --> 01:15:50.804
Okay. Thanks.
There's still hope, you know.

01:15:50.805 --> 01:15:51.805
More than hope.

01:15:51.806 --> 01:15:55.809
He could come out of it any time
and be okay with little consequences.

01:15:55.810 --> 01:15:57.812
Or very few.

01:15:57.813 --> 01:16:01.806
- Good-bye.
- <i>Adéu.</i>

01:16:04.821 --> 01:16:08.816
'That man is somehow'...

01:16:13.833 --> 01:16:17.836
'That man is somehow closely
and painfully connected with me'...

01:16:17.837 --> 01:16:19.839
'<i>'...</i> thought Prince Andre.

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:21.841
'Suddenly he remembered Natasha'...

01:16:21.842 --> 01:16:24.844
'<i>'...</i> as he'd first seen her
at the ball in 1810...

01:16:24.845 --> 01:16:27.847
'<i>'...</i> with her slender neck and arms...

01:16:27.848 --> 01:16:31.842
<i>'...with her timid, happy face
prepared for ecstasy.'</i>

01:16:32.854 --> 01:16:34.855
Fifteen minutes don't go by
that I don't think of her.

01:16:34.856 --> 01:16:38.851
- I think about her all the time.
- Too bad. I thought you'd gotten over her.

01:16:39.863 --> 01:16:40.863
What do you mean?

01:16:40.864 --> 01:16:43.866
It was impossible. You had no chance.

01:16:43.867 --> 01:16:47.872
- Why do you say that?
- It is only my opinion.

01:16:47.873 --> 01:16:51.876
When Fred was shot,
did he have envelopes of cash with him?

01:16:51.877 --> 01:16:53.879
Yes.

01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:56.882
That money's mine and I need it back.

01:16:56.883 --> 01:16:57.883
What?

01:16:57.884 --> 01:17:00.886
I need that money back.
I'm going on a journey.

01:17:00.887 --> 01:17:04.891
That money was taken from me.
Fred was just recovering it.

01:17:04.892 --> 01:17:07.895
You suspect me of having taken
that money?

01:17:07.896 --> 01:17:09.898
You didn't take it?

01:17:09.899 --> 01:17:13.902
I did. But it was only 300,000 pesetas.

01:17:13.903 --> 01:17:15.905
Fred took more than those.

01:17:15.906 --> 01:17:18.907
- What do you want?
- I want the money that belongs to me.

01:17:18.908 --> 01:17:22.913
- How much?
- 200,000 pesetas.

01:17:22.914 --> 01:17:25.916
I need that money. I'm going away.

01:17:25.917 --> 01:17:28.920
- Where?
- The Maldive Islands.

01:17:28.921 --> 01:17:29.921
The Maldives?

01:17:29.922 --> 01:17:33.916
I've decided to change my life completely.
But I need that money.

01:17:34.929 --> 01:17:37.931
From now on,
I want to lead an exemplary life.

01:17:37.932 --> 01:17:40.934
Exemplary? What about Fred?

01:17:40.935 --> 01:17:41.935
Fred shall not want to see me.

01:17:41.936 --> 01:17:45.940
Something shameful happened.
He did not tell you?

01:17:45.941 --> 01:17:49.935
The one Fred truly liked was Montserrat,
though he would never tell you.

01:18:19.981 --> 01:18:23.985
<i>Fred had gone into convulsions</i>
<i>while Aurora's friend was with him.</i>

01:18:23.986 --> 01:18:27.979
It's not your fault. You did
everything right. It's good you were there.

01:18:37.002 --> 01:18:39.003
Can you hear anything?

01:18:39.004 --> 01:18:42.007
If you can pull through this
you can rest at the lake.

01:18:42.008 --> 01:18:46.002
Try to think about the lake.

01:18:49.015 --> 01:18:53.019
Do you mind?
I feel awkward with someone looking on.

01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:54.020
What?

01:18:54.021 --> 01:18:57.024
I was going to say something
and it's awkward.

01:18:57.025 --> 01:19:01.019
- It will only be 5 or 10 minutes.
- I am sorry.

01:19:08.038 --> 01:19:12.032
You know some Catholic prayer?

01:19:22.055 --> 01:19:26.058
Are you the boy who wanted
to marry Montserrat?

01:19:26.059 --> 01:19:28.060
No.

01:19:28.061 --> 01:19:30.063
- Who told you that?
- What?

01:19:30.064 --> 01:19:32.066
That I wanted to marry Montserrat.

01:19:32.067 --> 01:19:36.070
It was just the story of an American boy
who fell in love with Montserrat...

01:19:36.071 --> 01:19:38.073
...decided he wanted to marry
and spend his life with her...

01:19:38.074 --> 01:19:42.066
...while they danced to a Bee Gees song.

01:19:45.082 --> 01:19:49.086
- Is he the boy in love with Montserrat?
- No.

01:19:49.087 --> 01:19:53.090
- I don't think so.
- Montserrat does know you.

01:19:53.091 --> 01:19:57.095
She called here after you left
and asked about both of you.

01:19:57.096 --> 01:19:59.098
What did she say?

01:19:59.099 --> 01:20:03.092
I don't know. Aurora took the call.

01:20:12.114 --> 01:20:15.116
Why weren't you in the article on the most
beautiful women at the Trade Fair?

01:20:15.117 --> 01:20:19.120
- You thought I should be?
- You should.

01:20:19.121 --> 01:20:22.125
- I loathe that fellow. You know him?
- We've met.

01:20:22.126 --> 01:20:26.130
That's interesting, you loathe him.
How come?

01:20:26.131 --> 01:20:30.135
I don't have the English.
In Castilian, we'd say he's <i>repelente.</i>

01:20:30.136 --> 01:20:33.139
Repellant. That's good.

01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:35.140
- What's your name?
- Greta.

01:20:35.141 --> 01:20:38.143
- That's not very Catalan.
- I'm not very Catalan.

01:20:38.144 --> 01:20:42.138
Who's this?

01:20:44.151 --> 01:20:46.153
- Are you religious?
- <i>Quasi.</i>

01:20:46.154 --> 01:20:50.148
- You want to be an artist?
- No.

01:20:52.161 --> 01:20:55.163
Listen, you should get some rest.

01:20:55.164 --> 01:20:58.168
You think I should go?

01:20:58.169 --> 01:21:02.163
I could stay longer if you like.
Until Aurora comes.

01:21:03.175 --> 01:21:07.169
Actually I was thinking of sacking out here.

01:21:08.181 --> 01:21:10.182
'Sacking out? '

01:21:10.183 --> 01:21:14.176
Sleeping here on the chairs, maybe.

01:21:19.193 --> 01:21:22.195
Do you think he will become well?

01:21:22.196 --> 01:21:26.201
- Are you convinced of that?
- Yes.

01:21:26.202 --> 01:21:29.203
It was great you were here last night.

01:21:29.204 --> 01:21:33.199
Thanks for staying.

01:21:56.237 --> 01:22:00.241
I'm sorry I didn't come so soon.
I only heard yesterday.

01:22:00.242 --> 01:22:03.244
- You only heard yesterday?
- Is he any better?

01:22:03.245 --> 01:22:05.246
No.

01:22:05.247 --> 01:22:08.250
Not yet.

01:22:08.251 --> 01:22:10.253
Fred was right.

01:22:10.254 --> 01:22:13.256
I persecuted him for trivialities.

01:22:13.257 --> 01:22:16.260
There were things that I blew way out
of proportion.

01:22:16.261 --> 01:22:20.256
Things that seemed crimes at the time,
but were really of no importance.

01:22:22.268 --> 01:22:25.270
Maybe he did save my life
going down in the kayak that way.

01:22:25.271 --> 01:22:28.274
Those Board scores,
that couldn't have been right.

01:22:28.275 --> 01:22:32.279
Before, I always thought
Fred was smarter than I was.

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:34.281
Maybe not smarter, but <i>...</i>

01:22:34.282 --> 01:22:37.285
Maybe his explanation was true.

01:22:37.286 --> 01:22:41.288
Fred said that when he took his Boards,
this annoying girl sat next to him...

01:22:41.289 --> 01:22:44.293
...who kept fiddling with her brassiere.

01:22:44.294 --> 01:22:48.297
Fred went to an all-boys school
and her fidgeting was so distracting...

01:22:48.298 --> 01:22:50.301
...he lost his place on the answer sheet.

01:22:50.302 --> 01:22:54.296
- You thought that was not true?
- I always assumed it was false.

01:22:57.310 --> 01:22:59.310
No. That's the way it's been.

01:22:59.311 --> 01:23:03.305
He moves and you think
he's come out of it.

01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:08.321
Should we go somewhere to talk?

01:23:08.322 --> 01:23:12.316
Until he comes out of this,
I resolved not to think of anything else.

01:23:13.328 --> 01:23:15.329
Maybe when Aurora comes.

01:23:15.330 --> 01:23:19.325
We came together.
They're in the cafeteria. I'll get them.

01:23:21.338 --> 01:23:25.332
I'll stay here with Fred.

01:23:28.347 --> 01:23:32.350
'Our Father, who art in heaven,
please forgive us our sins.'

01:23:32.351 --> 01:23:34.352
Please bring Fred back
to full consciousness...

01:23:34.353 --> 01:23:38.346
...with his mental capabilities
and everything reasonably intact.

01:23:39.359 --> 01:23:42.361
Please forgive my doubting,
vainglory, and...

01:23:42.362 --> 01:23:46.357
Give me a break.

01:23:47.369 --> 01:23:51.362
Doctor!

01:23:55.378 --> 01:23:59.372
How much can you remember?

01:24:02.387 --> 01:24:05.389
Do you remember who I am?

01:24:05.390 --> 01:24:07.391
- Do you remember who I am?
- Yes!

01:24:07.392 --> 01:24:09.393
Who am I?

01:24:09.394 --> 01:24:12.396
Some civilian.

01:24:12.397 --> 01:24:14.399
Who am I?

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:18.394
The kid with the kayak,
but older and fatter. Leave me alone!

01:24:19.407 --> 01:24:23.410
This is terrific.
He's going to have a complete recovery.

01:24:23.411 --> 01:24:25.413
It's amazing. This is really good.

01:24:25.414 --> 01:24:28.415
It looks like his recovery will be complete,
wouldn't you say?

01:24:28.416 --> 01:24:31.420
- Yes. His memory...
- But over the long term?

01:24:31.421 --> 01:24:33.422
Yes. Over the long term.

01:24:33.423 --> 01:24:35.424
It looks like his recovery will be complete.

01:24:35.425 --> 01:24:39.419
Yes.

01:24:53.447 --> 01:24:54.447
Damn.

01:24:54.448 --> 01:24:56.449
You fell asleep.

01:24:56.450 --> 01:24:59.453
Typical of this guy to make me meet him
at the airport.

01:24:59.454 --> 01:25:00.454
Who?

01:25:00.455 --> 01:25:02.456
Dickie Taylor.
The terrible guy from marketing...

01:25:02.457 --> 01:25:06.461
...is making me race off to the airport
to get fired.

01:25:06.462 --> 01:25:08.463
I can't believe that. They're crazy.

01:25:08.464 --> 01:25:12.469
I don't know.
I've been having all these doubts.

01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:16.464
Can you stay at the hospital
with Fred until I get back?

01:25:28.488 --> 01:25:32.482
I'm sorry to set it up this way,
but the only connecting flight is at 11:00.

01:25:37.498 --> 01:25:40.501
I should get to what I'm here for.
I have some really bad news.

01:25:40.502 --> 01:25:43.505
It is bad news.

01:25:43.506 --> 01:25:45.508
I thought so.

01:25:45.509 --> 01:25:49.513
Dickie, let's make this a lot easier. I quit.

01:25:49.514 --> 01:25:53.507
I don't understand why Jack
couldn't call me himself. It's not right.

01:25:54.519 --> 01:25:57.521
What are you talking about?
Jack's sick. He's going to die.

01:25:57.522 --> 01:25:59.523
- What?
- Jack's sick.

01:25:59.524 --> 01:26:02.527
I can't believe it.

01:26:02.528 --> 01:26:05.530
The whole company's devastated.
Jack's the last of the greats.

01:26:05.531 --> 01:26:07.533
- He's such a great guy.
- He is.

01:26:07.534 --> 01:26:11.538
I admit I resented the favoritism
he showed you.

01:26:11.539 --> 01:26:13.541
There was no favoritism.

01:26:13.542 --> 01:26:15.542
Come on.

01:26:15.543 --> 01:26:17.545
Anyway, Jack's very worried
about the company.

01:26:17.546 --> 01:26:21.550
Dwight and Ron are older, Tom and Greg
are gone with nobody to succeed them.

01:26:21.551 --> 01:26:24.554
Jack asked with whom I could work best.
Naturally, I mentioned you.

01:26:24.555 --> 01:26:27.557
In Marketing,
you've given us great feedback.

01:26:27.558 --> 01:26:31.562
It's had a critical dimension,
but you're right. Marketing's no science.

01:26:31.563 --> 01:26:34.565
He wants pledges that we'll stay
with the company at least 5 years...

01:26:34.566 --> 01:26:38.570
...and wants you back in Chicago
as soon as possible.

01:26:38.571 --> 01:26:39.571
I thought you came to fire me.

01:26:39.572 --> 01:26:43.576
What was all that 'I quit' stuff about?
For a moment I thought...

01:26:43.577 --> 01:26:46.580
I'm so far behind on the sales targets
you set.

01:26:46.581 --> 01:26:47.581
I didn't set them.

01:26:47.582 --> 01:26:48.582
- Jack did.
- What?

01:26:48.583 --> 01:26:52.586
You don't know Jack's theory.
He thinks you aren't cut out for sales.

01:26:52.587 --> 01:26:54.589
That it's not your life's work.

01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:58.594
But if you were behind, you'd struggle
to keep up and ignore the rest.

01:26:58.595 --> 01:27:02.599
- Jack doesn't think I'm cut out for sales?
- Not the way someone like Henry is.

01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:06.604
Selling is more than a job
one is cut out or not cut out for.

01:27:06.605 --> 01:27:10.608
It's a whole culture, applying the insights
of Carnegie and Bettger.

01:27:10.609 --> 01:27:12.610
We all like Carnegie and Bettger.

01:27:12.611 --> 01:27:15.614
Sales is the heart of any corporation.
Have you read Drucker?

01:27:15.615 --> 01:27:18.617
I saw that as the cult of management.

01:27:18.618 --> 01:27:21.621
No, Drucker's terrific. Read him. Here.

01:27:21.622 --> 01:27:24.624
The insight in this book is incredible.

01:27:24.625 --> 01:27:27.627
- I'll get it at Kroch's when I'm back.
- Keep it.

01:27:27.628 --> 01:27:31.623
I've memorized it and it's easier for me
to go to Kroch's when I get back.

01:27:32.635 --> 01:27:36.630
Thanks.

01:27:39.644 --> 01:27:43.647
You gotta admit, you're well on your way
to a complete and total recovery.

01:27:43.648 --> 01:27:44.648
It's incredible.

01:27:44.649 --> 01:27:48.643
Cut out the 'Pollyanna-Little-Miss-Mary-
Sunshine complete recovery' crap.

01:27:49.655 --> 01:27:53.649
You're almost pathological.
Sometimes, I'd like to wring your neck.

01:27:54.661 --> 01:27:58.654
The mood swings are new.

01:28:02.669 --> 01:28:06.675
Rehabilitation is fine for houses.
For people, it's unspeakably boring.

01:28:06.676 --> 01:28:09.678
The whole basis for physical therapy is...

01:28:09.679 --> 01:28:13.673
...doing the same thing
over and over and over again.

01:28:15.686 --> 01:28:18.689
- But it's important.
- Oh, yeah.

01:28:18.690 --> 01:28:21.692
Learning how to do things
you used to do much better?

01:28:21.693 --> 01:28:24.695
You really should read Drucker.

01:28:24.696 --> 01:28:26.697
- Think it's applicable to the Navy?
- Yeah.

01:28:26.698 --> 01:28:30.692
And whatever else you do afterwards.

01:28:31.705 --> 01:28:35.699
I started remembering things
about that girl, Marta.

01:28:37.711 --> 01:28:41.716
Everything has gone so badly.

01:28:41.717 --> 01:28:45.711
I'm not going to be a cry-baby.

01:28:47.724 --> 01:28:50.727
I remember something about a limbo stick.

01:28:50.728 --> 01:28:54.721
There was a limbo stick.

01:29:08.749 --> 01:29:11.751
<i>While I was in Chicago,</i>
<i>Fred used my office...</i>

01:29:11.752 --> 01:29:15.745
<i>...to prepare the</i> Fleet Information Sheet.

01:29:17.759 --> 01:29:21.753
Great. Thanks.

01:29:22.765 --> 01:29:25.768
That's really nice. Thanks.

01:29:25.769 --> 01:29:29.764
<i>Barcelona and Chicago never seemed</i>
<i>more beautiful than they did that fall.</i>

01:29:33.778 --> 01:29:35.780
<i>Commuting between them,</i>
<i>I started routing through London...</i>

01:29:35.781 --> 01:29:39.774
<i>...into Chicago directly,</i>
<i>avoiding New York and Madrid entirely.</i>

01:29:41.788 --> 01:29:43.789
<i>Twice I ran into Greta on the London leg.</i>

01:29:43.790 --> 01:29:45.791
<i>Apparently, she was visiting friends.</i>

01:29:45.792 --> 01:29:48.794
<i>It was sad watching Jack's decline.</i>

01:29:48.795 --> 01:29:50.796
<i>But he still had good days</i>
<i>and the memory of these...</i>

01:29:50.797 --> 01:29:53.801
<i>...will always be important to all of us.</i>

01:29:53.802 --> 01:29:56.804
<i>In Barcelona,</i>
<i>I had to quickly plan the wedding...</i>

01:29:56.805 --> 01:29:58.808
<i>...and wrap up my IHSMOCO work.</i>

01:29:58.809 --> 01:30:01.811
You never said you were getting married?

01:30:01.812 --> 01:30:03.814
<i>Fred's attitude really puzzled me.</i>

01:30:03.815 --> 01:30:06.816
<i>Initially, he seemed bitter.</i>

01:30:06.817 --> 01:30:08.818
I've never seen you like this. So cocky.

01:30:08.819 --> 01:30:11.822
Aren't you taking things for granted?
The boyfriend's still around.

01:30:11.823 --> 01:30:14.826
I'm not taking anything for granted
until the vows...

01:30:14.827 --> 01:30:17.829
You think wedding vows will
change everything?

01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:21.834
Your naiveté is astounding.
Didn't you see <i>The Graduate</i> ?

01:30:21.835 --> 01:30:24.836
You can remember <i>The Graduate</i> ?

01:30:24.837 --> 01:30:28.843
I can remember a few things.
Apparently you don't. The end?

01:30:28.844 --> 01:30:31.847
Katharine Ross has just married this cool,
tall, blond...

01:30:31.848 --> 01:30:34.850
...popular guy, the make-out king
of his fraternity.

01:30:34.851 --> 01:30:38.855
This obnoxious Dustin Hoffman character
shows up at the church...

01:30:38.856 --> 01:30:42.859
...starts pounding on the glass,
acting like a total asshole.

01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:45.862
'Elaine! Elaine! '

01:30:45.863 --> 01:30:49.867
Does Katharine Ross tell Dustin Hoffman,
'Get lost creep, I'm a married woman' ?

01:30:49.868 --> 01:30:50.868
No.

01:30:50.869 --> 01:30:54.874
She runs off with him. On a bus.

01:30:54.875 --> 01:30:56.876
That is the reality.

01:30:56.877 --> 01:30:58.878
Thanks a lot.

01:30:58.879 --> 01:31:02.872
<i>Then Fred's tone changed and he became</i>
<i>insanely positive about the wedding.</i>

01:31:03.884 --> 01:31:05.887
Of course I like her. She's great.

01:31:05.888 --> 01:31:09.891
You're right for each other.
It makes sense.

01:31:09.892 --> 01:31:12.895
- She's accepted and everything?
- Of course, she's accepted.

01:31:12.896 --> 01:31:16.890
That's great.

01:31:26.912 --> 01:31:29.915
Positive thinking is fine in theory.

01:31:29.916 --> 01:31:33.920
But when I try it on a systematic basis,
I end up really depressed.

01:31:33.921 --> 01:31:36.922
It doesn't work for me, either.

01:31:36.923 --> 01:31:40.928
God.

01:31:40.929 --> 01:31:43.931
- Good.
- You invited that guy?

01:31:43.932 --> 01:31:45.934
He was great when you were
in the hospital. You misjudged him.

01:31:45.935 --> 01:31:48.937
- He seems like a nice guy.
- He's paid to act that way.

01:31:48.938 --> 01:31:50.940
- How are you doing?
- Nice to see you.

01:31:50.941 --> 01:31:52.943
- How are you?
- Good morning.

01:31:52.944 --> 01:31:56.937
How are you doing?

01:32:05.958 --> 01:32:09.952
- No one from the bride's side.
- Her parents wanted to keep it small.

01:32:10.964 --> 01:32:13.966
They must be delighted she's marrying
an <i>Estadouni</i>- dense.

01:32:13.967 --> 01:32:17.961
No, they're not that way.
Her family's terrific.

01:32:29.986 --> 01:32:32.989
My father wanted me to explain.

01:32:32.990 --> 01:32:36.994
'Sorry for inconvenience.
Please take coffee, we there be soon.'

01:32:36.995 --> 01:32:39.997
- Everything's fine with your sister?
- Yes.

01:32:39.998 --> 01:32:42.000
We don't understand where she is,
but, not a problem.

01:32:42.001 --> 01:32:44.002
God!

01:32:44.003 --> 01:32:48.006
Not a problem.
My sister is a very serious girl.

01:32:48.007 --> 01:32:50.009
Do you know that?

01:32:50.010 --> 01:32:51.010
Yes.

01:32:51.011 --> 01:32:55.006
Lets go to the Meson.

01:33:00.023 --> 01:33:02.024
Things have been pretty tense.
I've hardly slept in a week.

01:33:02.025 --> 01:33:05.027
Her old boyfriend resurfaced
on Wednesday.

01:33:05.028 --> 01:33:06.028
Not a problem.

01:33:06.029 --> 01:33:09.031
I don't think anti-Americanism
is that significant.

01:33:09.032 --> 01:33:13.036
- It's nothing to take personally.
- Sorry if I take it personally.

01:33:13.037 --> 01:33:14.037
What is it, then?

01:33:14.038 --> 01:33:18.043
Let me use an analogy.
The US is like an enormous ant farm.

01:33:18.044 --> 01:33:20.045
God, not ants!

01:33:20.046 --> 01:33:24.049
A see-through plastic case
enclosing an ant colony.

01:33:24.050 --> 01:33:28.045
It's a toy sold to children so they can
watch ants build their own society.

01:33:29.057 --> 01:33:32.059
The US is like an ant farm
for the rest of the world.

01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:35.063
But, people living in other countries
can't observe the ants.

01:33:35.064 --> 01:33:39.058
They must rely on journalists
and commentators for a description.

01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:44.063
The problem is,
that these people seem to hate ants.

01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:53.084
I don't know if anyone
has mentioned it to you...

01:33:53.085 --> 01:33:56.088
...but it looks to me like you could be
shaving in the wrong direction.

01:33:56.089 --> 01:34:00.091
I wonder about that all the time.

01:34:00.092 --> 01:34:04.097
- Your father never taught you?
- He uses an electric razor, so I never asked.

01:34:04.098 --> 01:34:08.092
Your father uses an electric razor?
I never knew that.

01:34:09.104 --> 01:34:11.105
He's light-haired,
so it never really mattered.

01:34:11.106 --> 01:34:14.109
I really have to shave. It's no joke.

01:34:14.110 --> 01:34:18.104
- So, what is the right way to shave?
- First, you wash with hot water.

01:34:24.122 --> 01:34:28.115
They've just explained to me.
Aurora is coming now. Not a problem.

01:34:30.129 --> 01:34:34.132
I know this is awkward,
but you'll be leaving town soon.

01:34:34.133 --> 01:34:36.134
Now that everything seems set...

01:34:36.135 --> 01:34:40.140
...I should mention
that I'll be asking Montserrat out.

01:34:40.141 --> 01:34:43.144
I can't remember how things were
before I was shot, but since then...

01:34:43.145 --> 01:34:47.149
...I've had this incredible feeling for her.
Not some silly crush.

01:34:47.150 --> 01:34:50.152
I've seen her in different situations.
Some were really difficult.

01:34:50.153 --> 01:34:53.155
You clearly realized the way things were,
before she did.

01:34:53.156 --> 01:34:57.150
That was hard for her
as it was hard for you, before.

01:34:59.163 --> 01:35:02.165
We spent hours on the phone.
She's so fascinating.

01:35:02.166 --> 01:35:04.168
I can't go back without her.

01:35:04.169 --> 01:35:07.171
She'll like San Francisco
more than Chicago.

01:35:07.172 --> 01:35:11.175
It would be great, going to the Lake
with you and Greta there.

01:35:11.176 --> 01:35:15.181
- God! You always do this.
- I always do this?

01:35:15.182 --> 01:35:18.185
Can you try and be sympathetic
and cousinly?

01:35:18.186 --> 01:35:20.188
Pretend I'm one of your customers.

01:35:20.189 --> 01:35:21.189
Okay.

01:35:21.190 --> 01:35:24.192
But do we have to get into this now?
Things are a little tense.

01:35:24.193 --> 01:35:26.195
My bride hasn't shown up.

01:35:26.196 --> 01:35:28.196
She'll show up. She's gaga for you.

01:35:28.197 --> 01:35:30.198
You think so?

01:35:30.199 --> 01:35:34.193
She didn't spend time in the hospital
to see how <i>War and Peace</i> turned out.

01:35:35.205 --> 01:35:37.207
She's actually looking forward
to the 80 channels...

01:35:37.208 --> 01:35:41.212
...the consumer products.
It doesn't bother her.

01:35:41.213 --> 01:35:44.216
Of course not. She's terrific.

01:35:44.217 --> 01:35:47.218
You should want Montserrat
to have a chance of happiness.

01:35:47.219 --> 01:35:50.222
You're her chance of happiness?

01:35:50.223 --> 01:35:52.225
Maybe.

01:35:52.226 --> 01:35:55.229
So what's your plan?
You gonna play it somewhat cool?

01:35:55.230 --> 01:35:59.224
I'm going to play it really cool.

01:36:04.239 --> 01:36:08.233
Hello. Please.

01:36:10.247 --> 01:36:14.251
I know some people think
that the articles I wrote...

01:36:14.252 --> 01:36:17.255
...were in some way related
to your shooting.

01:36:17.256 --> 01:36:21.259
I don't agree that a journalist
should be criticized for writing articles...

01:36:21.260 --> 01:36:23.261
...he believes to be true.

01:36:23.262 --> 01:36:27.256
But, if anything I've done has caused you
harm in any way...

01:36:28.269 --> 01:36:32.272
...please accept my sincere regret.

01:36:32.273 --> 01:36:35.276
If there's anything I can do for you
in the future...

01:36:35.277 --> 01:36:39.281
...please, do not hesitate.

01:36:39.282 --> 01:36:41.283
Thank you very much.

01:36:41.284 --> 01:36:45.278
Actually, I think there might be something.

01:36:58.303 --> 01:37:01.306
These go with these, and those with those.

01:37:01.307 --> 01:37:05.301
Fantastic!

01:37:12.321 --> 01:37:13.322
Incredible.

01:37:13.323 --> 01:37:17.315
You see, we're not such idiots.

01:37:31.343 --> 01:37:33.343
She's really beautiful.

01:37:33.344 --> 01:37:34.344
Yeah.

01:37:34.345 --> 01:37:36.348
I am not sure how important that is.

01:37:36.349 --> 01:37:38.350
I really like her.

01:37:38.351 --> 01:37:41.355
She keeps asking about my underwear,
and then smirking...

01:37:41.356 --> 01:37:44.358
...as if I am supposed to know
what she's talking about.

01:37:44.359 --> 01:37:47.362
What are 'weekends of fun' ?

01:37:47.363 --> 01:37:49.364
Oh, that.

01:37:49.365 --> 01:37:53.368
Montserrat was the same way.
It's a Barcelona girl thing.

01:37:53.369 --> 01:37:55.370
It does sound familiar.

01:37:55.371 --> 01:37:57.372
Odd.

01:37:57.373 --> 01:38:00.376
That's what's great about
getting involved with a foreigner.

01:38:00.377 --> 01:38:02.378
You can't take it personally.

01:38:02.379 --> 01:38:06.384
What's really terrific is that when we act
in ways which might objectively...

01:38:06.385 --> 01:38:10.378
...seem assholish, or incredibly annoying,
they don't get upset at all.

01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:15.395
They just assume it's some
national characteristic.

01:38:15.396 --> 01:38:17.397
- <i>Cosa de gringos.</i>
- Yeah.

01:38:17.398 --> 01:38:21.392
- Fantastic.
- Yeah.
