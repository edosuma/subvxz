No, honestly, we just relaunched
this business.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.941
Our supply chain
wasn't able to fulfill,

17:21.941 --> 17:24.176
so we had to pull back until
we were ready to go full speed.

17:24.176 --> 17:25.545
How much are you
making the hat for,

17:25.545 --> 17:26.779
and how much
you selling it for?

17:26.779 --> 17:28.848
So landed is $20.

17:28.848 --> 17:29.949
Whoa.

17:29.949 --> 17:31.751
And we're retailing it
for $65.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.386
Whoa.
$65 -- whoa.

17:33.386 --> 17:36.889
We've actually sold the hats
at events for over $100,

17:36.889 --> 17:38.057
and we've had
some charities

17:38.057 --> 17:40.593
actually auction them off
for over $1,000.

17:40.593 --> 17:43.629
I believe that.
So how did you come up
with this idea?

17:43.629 --> 17:45.798
So the idea was born
when my daughter and I

17:45.798 --> 17:48.234
entered a Best Dressed
golfer's competition,

17:48.234 --> 17:51.137
and I wore a large hat
that everybody loved.

17:51.137 --> 17:53.606
And when I got home,
we made a few prototypes

17:53.606 --> 17:55.308
and tried it out
at a few events,

17:55.308 --> 17:57.243
and the response
was so positive

17:57.243 --> 17:58.811
that we knew
we just had to do this.

17:58.811 --> 18:01.314
John: Now, did you approach
any owners, such as Mark?

18:01.314 --> 18:04.317
Because they can sell
in their own arenas.

18:04.317 --> 18:06.118
Have you approached
anybody yet like that?

18:06.118 --> 18:07.119
We haven't been able

18:07.119 --> 18:08.921
to get through
to those individuals,

18:08.921 --> 18:10.690
but again,
at the NBA Finals,

18:10.690 --> 18:12.158
our exposure
was unreal.

18:12.158 --> 18:14.293
I actually snuck in...
What kind of hat
did you have on?

18:14.293 --> 18:16.996
...over 40 of these Noggins
into the finals.

18:16.996 --> 18:18.965
Greiner: How would you sneak
40 of these anywhere?

18:18.965 --> 18:21.334
That's what was amazing.
I had two giant trash bags.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.235
My wife didn't believe
that it was gonna happen,

18:23.235 --> 18:24.270
and we got them in.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.005
You got in
with trash bags?
With trash bags.

18:26.005 --> 18:27.306
They were in
all the lower --

18:27.306 --> 18:28.274
In which city?

18:28.274 --> 18:29.642
In Phoenix.
Shawn: In Phoenix.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.944
I see security is tight
as a whistle.
Wow.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.946
So you need a Shark
to open doors for you.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.147
That's why you're here?

18:35.147 --> 18:36.449
Because you're not asking
for a lot of money.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.985
We wanted to show
that we are here to do a deal,

18:38.985 --> 18:40.786
and we wanted
to come in fair.
You did it the right way.
You did it the right way.

18:40.786 --> 18:43.356
We did not want to put you guys
off with all these grandeurs

18:43.356 --> 18:45.358
that these could be
the sales.

18:45.358 --> 18:47.393
We can tell you
when we wear these hats

18:47.393 --> 18:48.995
and when we see people
wear them,

18:48.995 --> 18:50.896
you're giving away
a million smiles,

18:50.896 --> 18:52.565
and the amount of people
that walk up to you

18:52.565 --> 18:55.034
and they want to take
their picture with you,

18:55.034 --> 18:56.535
it unites people
like no other.

18:56.535 --> 18:59.038
You guys have the manufacturing
logistics nailed down?

18:59.038 --> 19:01.040
We do.
We're actually able to scale.

19:01.040 --> 19:03.442
And one of the things that we
pivoted during this whole season

19:03.442 --> 19:05.378
was to figure out
local production,

19:05.378 --> 19:06.512
which was very hard,

19:06.512 --> 19:08.614
but we now have
the proprietary equipment.

19:08.614 --> 19:11.484
But are you making these
in the USA or are you
making them overseas?

19:11.484 --> 19:13.319
Yeah, 'cause you just said you
got some expensive equipment.

19:13.319 --> 19:14.687
That's the confusing part.
Yeah.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.355
Or is that
for the embroidery?
Embroidery.

19:16.355 --> 19:18.257
So we do customization
here locally.

19:18.257 --> 19:20.359
Oh, alright.
Okay,
so what does it cost

19:20.359 --> 19:21.761
just for the hat without
the embroidery?

19:21.761 --> 19:23.029
Around $12.

19:23.029 --> 19:24.664
Okay,
just for the hat.
Greiner: Oh, okay.

19:24.664 --> 19:25.865
Do you have a patent
on this?

19:25.865 --> 19:26.932
You know,
we've trademarked

19:26.932 --> 19:28.734
and tradenamed
everything that we can.

19:28.734 --> 19:30.369
But you don't have
a patent, right?

19:30.369 --> 19:31.637
Well, it's probably
not patentable.

19:31.637 --> 19:32.972
It's not patentable.
There's no way.

19:32.972 --> 19:34.707
Yeah, I know,
but I mean, the concern becomes

19:34.707 --> 19:36.742
if another company said,
"Let's turn on that switch,"

19:36.742 --> 19:38.244
because they already
have the license.

19:38.244 --> 19:39.745
Yeah, of course, but they're
only going to turn on the switch

19:39.745 --> 19:41.347
if they're already big, right,
and there's a market there.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.149
One of our biggest advantages
we feel

19:43.149 --> 19:45.751
is that we have speed to market
and we're already here.

19:45.751 --> 19:46.752
We're ready to go.

19:46.752 --> 19:49.422
We've seen
the proof of concept go --

19:49.422 --> 19:50.756
Because this is probably
a sublicense

19:50.756 --> 19:52.858
of a person
who already has the licensing.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.393
For hats.
Yeah, for hats.

19:54.393 --> 19:56.395
Yeah, so what he's saying
is you could go to somebody

19:56.395 --> 19:58.964
who already has an NBA license
for hats

19:58.964 --> 20:00.566
and just sublicense it
really easily.

20:00.566 --> 20:01.867
And that's why
we're here.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.769
We genuinely want somebody
that understands that space

20:03.769 --> 20:06.338
that can help us
navigate those deals

20:06.338 --> 20:07.740

I'll get you into the Mavs.

The Hangar is what we call it,

20:16.549 --> 20:19.785
where we sell merchandise,
so you could put Mavs on there

20:19.785 --> 20:22.421

or whatever, see if they sell.

Hi, Sharks.

My name is Athena Kasvikis.

22:15.067 --> 22:16.969
I'm from Boston, Massachusetts,

22:19.872 --> 22:24.510
for 15% of my company,
Behave Bras.

22:24.510 --> 22:27.513
So, Sharks, I grew up
in a big Greek family

22:27.513 --> 22:29.381
and I always felt supported.

22:29.381 --> 22:33.953
But I developed a problem.
Well, actually two big problems.

22:33.953 --> 22:37.456
[ Laughs ]
I developed large breasts
at a young age,

22:37.456 --> 22:40.593
and they just destroyed my back
and my neck and my shoulders.

22:40.593 --> 22:43.128
I used to have to wear not one,

22:43.128 --> 22:46.699
not two, three sports bras
just to play soccer...
Wow.

22:46.699 --> 22:49.935
...and keep the girls in place
without losing an eye.

22:49.935 --> 22:51.403
[ Laughs ]
And I am not alone.

22:51.403 --> 22:54.106
There are 50 million women today
in the United States

22:54.106 --> 22:57.209
with large breasts struggling
to find support

22:57.209 --> 22:59.011
and comfortable options.

22:59.011 --> 23:02.414
That's why I developed
patent-pending Stayz technology

23:02.414 --> 23:05.384
that you can only find
on a Behave bra

23:05.384 --> 23:07.653
because I know
from personal experience,

23:07.653 --> 23:10.489
large breasts need a lot more
than just lift.

23:10.489 --> 23:12.057
Let me show you how it works.

23:12.057 --> 23:14.460
So Stayz are stretchy
pieces of fabric,

23:14.460 --> 23:17.563
and they live in the cup
of every Behave bra.

23:17.563 --> 23:20.499
They encapsulate each breast
and ensure that both

23:20.499 --> 23:23.969
of the girls are staying
in their assigned seats.

23:23.969 --> 23:27.539
They're kind of like a soft
seatbelt but for your bust,

23:27.539 --> 23:32.244
and Stayz are so secure
that they keep you supported...

23:32.244 --> 23:34.647
even if you go sideways.

23:34.647 --> 23:38.317
So Stayz get rid of boob smash,
boob jiggle, and boob sweat.

23:38.317 --> 23:42.288
And they are a huge reason

23:42.288 --> 23:43.689
Behave bras is not just

23:43.689 --> 23:45.991
the most supportive thing
in their bra drawer,

the most beautiful.

Sure.

23:56.435 --> 23:57.937
So, I'm holding up
this one here,

about the Stayz.

24:01.173 --> 24:02.675
That is the Stay.
The Stay.

24:02.675 --> 24:06.145
So it's almost like
an underlining back here,

24:06.145 --> 24:07.646
but it twists.

24:07.646 --> 24:09.081
That's right.
Okay.

24:09.081 --> 24:11.150
It's a very obvious,
non-obvious construction.

24:11.150 --> 24:14.186

so that it can form a pocket

24:14.186 --> 24:15.721

25:03.969 --> 25:06.305
This is a wire,
I guess, of sorts,

25:06.305 --> 25:09.074
but it feels totally soft
and very bendable

25:09.074 --> 25:10.676
and almost just
feels like fabric.

25:10.676 --> 25:12.911
Are you calling this
a new kind of wire?

25:12.911 --> 25:15.681
And does it lend that
same kind of uplift to a bra?

25:15.681 --> 25:18.751
So yes, I think what you're also
feeling is the padded straps,

25:18.751 --> 25:20.019
-Yes.

25:20.019 --> 25:21.553

25:21.553 --> 25:23.222
That was something
that women wanted.

To answer your question,
my whole goal,

25:25.357 --> 25:27.259
like, the utopia for a bra,

25:27.259 --> 25:29.695
is to design something
for the heaviest breasts,

25:29.695 --> 25:33.632
it's like a skyscraper, and keep
that supported and uplifted.

25:33.632 --> 25:36.201
So what's your background
that you figured this out?

25:36.201 --> 25:38.404
So, I'm Greek and Italian.

25:38.404 --> 25:41.173
And in my family, you have
an A or you have a G cup.

25:41.173 --> 25:43.742
That's really all we get
in my family.
[ Laughs ]

25:43.742 --> 25:46.578
So when I developed breasts,
I was very athletic

25:46.578 --> 25:48.547
and I really struggled.

25:48.547 --> 25:51.383
And I was a brand manager
on some of the largest brands

25:51.383 --> 25:53.786
at Procter & Gamble,
and I loved it.

25:53.786 --> 25:56.488
I left Procter to go work
for startups and learned

25:56.488 --> 25:59.058
how to basically start
a company with zero dollars.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.626
Can you tell us
some about the business?

26:00.626 --> 26:02.428

right down the list.

Okay.
We have margins
of 87 on the bras

26:09.301 --> 26:11.603
and 83 on the panties.
Wow.

26:11.603 --> 26:14.706

Are you only
direct to consumer?

26:14.706 --> 26:16.141
It's only through
our website today.

a lot of returns?

We have one of the lowest return
rates for online lingerie.

Industry average
is 20% to 40%.

26:30.823 --> 26:32.424
Athena, what is
the game plan?

26:32.424 --> 26:34.159
Is it to blow it up
direct to consumer,

26:34.159 --> 26:36.495
keep these
80-plus percent margins?

26:36.495 --> 26:39.164
Absolutely.
Because we own our consumer,

26:39.164 --> 26:40.833
and she's already loyal.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.835
We own the most valuable

26:42.835 --> 26:46.271

of lingerie out there today.

than A's, B's, C's, or D's

-I wish I had it in my size.
-What's the game plan

33:32.844 --> 33:34.145
for distribution
on this stuff?

33:34.145 --> 33:36.181
So we are focused
on our direct to customer

33:36.181 --> 33:38.149
channel through our website.
And how's it going?

33:38.149 --> 33:39.951
Over 11 months we've been
running now,

33:39.951 --> 33:43.054
and our sales are
really, really strong.

33:43.054 --> 33:45.457
They're showing up
at $160K.

33:45.457 --> 33:47.259
What is the average
cost to make it?

33:47.259 --> 33:48.593
Yes, so...
And what do you sell it at?

33:48.593 --> 33:50.295
It takes
about $6 to make,

33:50.295 --> 33:52.264
$19 retail to sell.

33:52.264 --> 33:54.266
You sell this for $19?

33:54.266 --> 33:56.201
Accessibility
is so important to us.

33:56.201 --> 33:57.936
We really want
the average person

33:57.936 --> 33:59.104
to be able to purchase
these clothes.

33:59.104 --> 34:00.872
And that's why you're sticking
to direct to consumer

34:00.872 --> 34:02.774
because you need those margins.
Exactly. Exactly.

34:02.774 --> 34:04.042
So we can keep
our margins healthy.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.210
So, can you tell us
a little bit about you,

34:05.210 --> 34:06.211
about your background?

34:06.211 --> 34:08.280
So, I was actually an attorney
before doing this.

34:08.280 --> 34:10.282
But I also understood
as I began to do that job

34:10.282 --> 34:12.450
that I had a draw
to something else,

34:12.450 --> 34:14.619
and I found myself
tinkering ideas outside of work.

34:14.619 --> 34:16.254
And I knew at some point I was
going to come across an idea

34:16.254 --> 34:17.622
that I was going to
have to build out.

34:17.622 --> 34:19.090
And that's what this is,
right?

34:19.090 --> 34:20.559
He has a supply
chain background.
He can get into that.

34:20.559 --> 34:21.459
Thank you.

34:21.459 --> 34:23.328
So my background is in...

34:23.328 --> 34:25.730
I have an engineering degree
and an MBA at Yale,

34:25.730 --> 34:27.132
where I met
my beautiful wife.

34:27.132 --> 34:29.935
And then after that, like,
I have a 15-year career

34:29.935 --> 34:33.271
where I've worked at Amazon
and also at Apple

34:33.271 --> 34:35.273
for both the retail
and the consumer side.

34:35.273 --> 34:37.108
So in terms of who
we actually are, right,

34:37.108 --> 34:39.744
so I was 4 years old when
my family moved from Nigeria

34:39.744 --> 34:41.146
to Montreal, Canada,

34:41.146 --> 34:42.814
and my parents
began from scratch.

34:42.814 --> 34:45.317
There were washing bathrooms.
They were line cooks.

34:45.317 --> 34:47.485
My parents would wake me up
in the wee hours of the morning,

34:47.485 --> 34:48.820
shovel me into their car,

34:48.820 --> 34:50.422
and we would go around
and distribute newspapers.

34:50.422 --> 34:52.090
So they were
really hustling.

34:52.090 --> 34:53.959
And they went from that
to earning multiple degrees

34:53.959 --> 34:55.527
and having
their own businesses.

34:55.527 --> 34:58.029
Watching that growing up
just ignited in me

34:58.029 --> 35:00.131
a belief in the power of a dream
and a vision

35:00.131 --> 35:02.867
and putting everything you can
into making it happen.

35:02.867 --> 35:04.402
Are you doing this full time?

35:04.402 --> 35:07.339
We are both full time.
But you're only
doing 15K a month in sales,

35:07.339 --> 35:09.641
and obviously not all of that
is income.

35:09.641 --> 35:11.276
How are you guys surviving?

35:11.276 --> 35:14.646
We're able to save some money
and sort of invest our funds

35:14.646 --> 35:16.281
into the company --
Our funds and our time.

35:16.281 --> 35:18.283
So, let me ask you a question.
What would you use
the $175,000 for?

35:18.283 --> 35:19.784
What would you use our money,

35:19.784 --> 35:21.386
and what would you hope
a Shark would do?

35:21.386 --> 35:23.355
We're going to invest
a lot of it into the product.

35:23.355 --> 35:24.322
You mean inventory?

35:24.322 --> 35:25.790
-Exactly.
-Inventory.

35:25.790 --> 35:27.192
The other part
is growing our team.

35:27.192 --> 35:29.227
We want to grow our team
to be able to market,

35:29.227 --> 35:32.063
get the message out to people
in creative ways.

35:32.063 --> 35:33.365
I think we need implementers,

35:33.365 --> 35:35.967
so we have really
wonderful strategies and ideas,

35:35.967 --> 35:37.302
particularly on
the marketing side.

35:37.302 --> 35:39.504
And it's really a matter of,
like, we are two people.

35:39.504 --> 35:41.439
And so there are only
so many hours of the day

35:41.439 --> 35:43.174
to get that
work actually done.

35:43.174 --> 35:45.176
So at this juncture
in the business,

35:45.176 --> 35:47.178
do you think it was wise
for both of you

35:47.178 --> 35:49.014
to give up high-paying jobs?

35:49.014 --> 35:50.515
I mean, you're all-in here.

35:50.515 --> 35:53.351
If this doesn't work out,
this is a bad outcome.
It'll work out.

35:53.351 --> 35:54.419
We're very confident
it's gonna work out.
It's gonna --

35:54.419 --> 35:56.354
There's no reason
why this shouldn't work out.

35:56.354 --> 35:58.490
It's a binary outcome.
Either it works or it doesn't.

35:58.490 --> 36:01.326
If it doesn't work,
you guys are screwed.

36:01.326 --> 36:03.261
We are betting
on ourselves, right?

36:03.261 --> 36:05.497
But realize, every entrepreneur

36:05.497 --> 36:07.032
bets on themselves, right?
Right.

36:07.032 --> 36:08.366
That's the nature, right?

36:08.366 --> 36:10.535
But why such a high valuation?

36:10.535 --> 36:13.872
I mean, right now, you're asking
$175,000 for 10%.

36:13.872 --> 36:17.809
If you distributed
$100,000 a year

36:17.809 --> 36:20.578
and I made 10% off that,

36:20.578 --> 36:23.214
that's $10,000 a year
I would have.

36:23.214 --> 36:25.483
It would take me 17 years
to get my money back.

36:25.483 --> 36:27.385
Do you understand
what you're asking?

36:27.385 --> 36:29.788
The way we see the value
of the company today

36:29.788 --> 36:31.356
is based on
the potential --

36:31.356 --> 36:33.258
You said today.
Right.

36:36.594 --> 36:39.631
We see based on
the traction we have so far,

36:39.631 --> 36:41.800
we think we can grow
to a place where --

is what you are.

today.

36:52.777 --> 36:54.446
-Yeah, but from a small base.
-$500,000.

36:54.446 --> 36:55.880
I'm asking an honest question.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.282
I mean, Mark, how are you
going to get your money back?

36:57.282 --> 36:59.484
-It's a good question.
-It's a fair question, and --

36:59.484 --> 37:01.052
But I look at it this way.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.954
Mark, any acquisition
is four times sales,

37:02.954 --> 37:04.456
6 times, 10 times...

37:04.456 --> 37:07.425
Except when you're a relatively
small, unique startup.

37:07.425 --> 37:10.061
It's hard to argue a
$1.7 million value on this one.

37:10.061 --> 37:11.062
I'm sure
they're gonna negotiate.

37:11.062 --> 37:12.097
Let me tell you,
there's no way to --

37:12.097 --> 37:13.264
there's no real formula
out there.

37:13.264 --> 37:14.165
We're all making it up.

37:14.165 --> 37:15.300
-Exactly.
-Exactly.

37:15.300 --> 37:18.436
Anyways, I was going to say
clothing is not my thing.

37:18.436 --> 37:21.272
I like to dig into things
I add a lot of value in,

37:21.272 --> 37:24.309

one of them, so I'm out.

Cuban: Hey, guys, I'm kind of
in the same boat.

37:27.545 --> 37:30.081
The accelerant that you need
is then the details

37:30.081 --> 37:31.449
and the operational elements
of it,

37:31.449 --> 37:33.585

strong suit for clothing.

I'm out.

agree with your vision

37:40.625 --> 37:42.327

either way...

37:47.932 --> 37:50.635
that you should be
hiring on staff at all.

37:50.635 --> 37:53.404
Right.
And I think you can outsource
the needs that you have.

37:53.404 --> 37:55.673
You can hire somebody
in marketing

37:55.673 --> 37:57.308

37:57.308 --> 37:59.744

You know, I love your product.

We're here to negotiate,
right?

38:18.363 --> 38:21.166

I know, but what
I would have to ask,

I wouldn't even be happy being
a partner asking for that much,

50% of your dream.
