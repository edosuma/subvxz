- G'day, Sue.

- We got a panic call from the Rangers.

They spotted a huge croc
in the Tarrabool swimming hole.

who'd catch it, and Mick won.

- He went after it alone, did he?
- No.

meet him out there.

I'll tell Mick for you.
If he gets tied up with that croc,

- I'll pick up the young fella myself.

Oh, remember the good old days
when we just used to shoot 'em?

08:36.458 --> 08:41.820
Yeah, mate, but if there were no more
crocs, they wouldn't need hunters.

08:41.940 --> 08:46.779

no clues to what he's working on?

on the first two movies...

for practically nothing.

be cheaper to make your films...

instead of both places?

Now there's 20 of us, eh?

59:28.219 --> 59:30.779
Yeah, but you can't do that.
It's illegal.

59:30.860 --> 59:33.820
Well, I don't see any cops.

59:33.900 --> 59:36.499
Yeah, but they have cameras
at all these intersections, see?

59:36.580 --> 59:40.380
If you do anything wrong, they take
your picture and send you a fine.

59:42.300 --> 59:44.580
Yeah, but I ain't wearing
a number plate around my neck,

59:44.660 --> 59:47.259
so how the hell are they
gonna know who I am, huh?

59:50.380 --> 59:54.179
When you landed here,
you showed 'em your passport, right?

59:54.259 --> 59:56.259
- Yeah.
- Got your picture in it, dopey.

59:56.340 --> 59:58.300
Oh, yeah, right.

01:00:00.019 --> 01:00:01.939
I wonder
how much they fine you.

01:00:01.979 --> 01:00:04.620
It all depends on how many times
you push the button.

01:00:07.459 --> 01:00:11.739
- This looks like us.
- Great. Texas bar. We're in.

01:00:11.779 --> 01:00:13.939
This could be a bit of fun.

01:00:13.979 --> 01:00:17.140
These American cowboys
like a good barroom brawl.

- ## [Disco ]
- Howdy, boys. Step on in.

01:00:19.459 --> 01:00:21.340
Howdy, ma'am.

- Ma'am.
- Howdy, cowboys.

# It's raining men

Stone the bloody crows!

01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:38.620
That must've been
one of those poofter bars.

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:43.779
Yup. Only I believe
the correct term is "gay homosexual. "

01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:46.019
That's what they call
their shirt-lifters over here.

01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:49.620
The only woman there was
the cowgirl at the door.

01:00:51.259 --> 01:00:53.459
## [ Rap ]

01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:57.380

or I'll blow you away.

- ## [Rap Continues]
- Uh, hang on. I can't hear you.

## [Stops]

- That's better. Now how can I help you?
- Smart-ass cowboy, huh?

01:01:06.699 --> 01:01:08.860
- Hand me over your money, man!
- They ain't cowboys.

01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:13.420
- They're fools dressed up!
- Fools got money too. [ Laughing ]

01:01:13.499 --> 01:01:16.699
- Give it up or I'll bust a cap in your ass!
- Yeah, hand it over, bitch!

01:01:17.779 --> 01:01:20.259
Bitch?

01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:23.699
Son, you have any idea how quick
you have to be to catch a tiger snake?

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:30.459
I'm always getting mugged.
I must look rich.

01:01:30.499 --> 01:01:33.939
It's one of them soft-top cars.
Cave in.

- [Punks Yelling]
- [ Horn Honks ]

01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:40.380
- Ow!
- You know,

01:01:40.459 --> 01:01:42.900
this must be why they call L. A.
the "City on Wheels. "

01:01:42.979 --> 01:01:43.820
What do you mean?

01:01:43.939 --> 01:01:46.300
They don't even get out
of their car to mug you.

01:01:47.499 --> 01:01:51.100
- Hey!
- [ Groaning] Ow!

01:01:51.179 --> 01:01:54.739
It's all your fault, homes!
You shouldn't have called him a bitch!

01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:01.340
Should we call the cops?

01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:06.140
No point. Over here,
they'd probably end up suing us.

01:02:06.179 --> 01:02:09.380
Besides, it's not their fault.

01:02:09.459 --> 01:02:11.380
It's the drugs.

01:02:11.459 --> 01:02:14.900
I saw all about it
on that Geraldo Rivera.

01:02:14.939 --> 01:02:16.860
He knows the streets.

01:02:16.939 --> 01:02:19.100
Let's just get a cup of coffee
and go home.

01:02:19.219 --> 01:02:22.380
Don't be too hasty
ordering coffee around here.

01:02:22.459 --> 01:02:24.820
You might not be too happy
with the way they serve it.

01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:26.860
Trust me.

01:02:29.499 --> 01:02:33.580
And this is where a big crocodile
almost bit his leg right off.

01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:35.699
- Whoa!
- Neat!

01:02:35.779 --> 01:02:40.860
Well, to tell the truth, kids,
it wasn't really that big.

01:02:41.939 --> 01:02:44.219
No more than 20 feet or so
anyway.

01:02:44.259 --> 01:02:46.420
[Boy]
Whoa! That's huge!

01:02:54.779 --> 01:02:57.739
- [ Chittering ]
- Yes, I know.

01:02:57.820 --> 01:03:01.219
They just don't appreciate
a real artiste. I'd have bit him too.

01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:03.979
I thought you were fabulous.

01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:06.340
I don't care what that director said.
He's an idiot.

01:03:07.739 --> 01:03:09.979
You were really good.

01:03:10.019 --> 01:03:11.900
- You said black with one sugar, right?
- Oh, yes.

01:03:11.939 --> 01:03:14.380
- Thanks, mate. Excellent.
- And...

01:03:14.459 --> 01:03:16.380
I got us a little treat
for our friend here.

01:03:16.459 --> 01:03:18.779
Oh, great.
That'll hit the spot.

01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:21.739
- Black and one sugar.
- [ Slurps ]

01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:25.019
She's a bit grumpy today.

01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:27.420
Not happy with
the size of her trailer.

01:03:27.499 --> 01:03:29.459
She wants a big one like Virgil,
but I keep telling her,

01:03:29.499 --> 01:03:32.060
"Virgil's a lion.
You're only a monkey. "

01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:35.539
- [ Chittering ]
- Sorry.

"Chimpanzee. "

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:39.420
Say, have you thought
about changing agents?

01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:44.459
Diego, you're talking to a chimp.
They don't speak English.

01:03:44.539 --> 01:03:47.539
Neither did my first wife.

01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:48.539
Neither did my first wife.

Keep moving, Dravos.

01:04:18.699 --> 01:04:22.019

Mind the painting!

[ Muttering ]

01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:33.979

against the wall for now.

- [ Thuds ]
- Carefully!

01:04:43.979 --> 01:04:46.900
G'day, Phil.
What's happening, mate?

01:04:46.979 --> 01:04:49.580
Hi, Mick.
The usual continuity nightmare.

01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:51.820
Right.

01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:55.580
- What's that mean?
- It means I have to make this set...

01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:59.219
look exactly like it did
on location in Yugoslavia.

01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:04.539
Yugoslavia. Is that where
all these paintings come from?

01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:07.939
Yup. They had them
done there. Dumb.

01:05:08.019 --> 01:05:11.580
Would've been cheaper here,
and more realistic.

01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:15.660
Oh, so none of these are valuable.
They're just all copies.

01:05:15.739 --> 01:05:18.380
Yup, and rather
poor ones at that.

01:05:18.459 --> 01:05:23.219
And these huge, tacky frames?
For God sakes.

01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:25.979
Don't they usually cart
the sets and the props...

01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:29.179
from one country
to another and back again?

01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:32.539
Maybe in a big-budget international
movie like Mission: Impossible 3.

01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:35.259
But I haven't seen Tom Cruise
hanging around the set, have you?

01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:39.779
Tom Cruise.
What's he look like?

01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:42.820
Like... Tom Cruise.

01:05:45.179 --> 01:05:47.580
Jeez, Mick, were you
born in a cave?

01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:49.539
Yeah!
How did you know that?

01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:51.620
Never mind.

01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:56.420
Jim, the Van Goghs
are down at the wrong end.

01:05:56.539 --> 01:05:59.699
See, here they started with
the Gauguins, one above the other.

01:05:59.739 --> 01:06:01.939
Let's get this right.
We gotta be done in here tonight.

01:06:01.979 --> 01:06:03.860
They're shooting
in here tomorrow.

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:17.820
[ Sniffs ]

01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:20.100
[Mick ] You see,
you can mix heroin into a plaster,

01:06:20.179 --> 01:06:22.019
make it any shape you like.

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:25.979
So, when I see this guy go nuts 'cause
they bumped the lousy painting,

01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:28.140
that's when I knew
where the drugs were hidden--

01:06:28.219 --> 01:06:30.100
molded into the picture frames.

01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:33.340
Pure heroin, or
as we call it, "smack. "

01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:36.539
Jeez, Mick, you really do
think like a detective.

01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:40.140
Yeah, well, it comes sort of
natural to me, you know?

01:06:40.219 --> 01:06:42.380
- Hey, Mick.
- Ah.

01:06:42.459 --> 01:06:45.420
That was the police lab.

01:06:45.499 --> 01:06:48.820
Sorry. The frames are just plaster.
There's no drugs.

01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:50.779
Oh, bugger it.

01:06:52.179 --> 01:06:54.340
I was sure
I cracked the case.

01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:57.420
I don't know. Maybe they're not
smuggling anything.

01:06:57.499 --> 01:06:59.420
Oh, no. They're sneaking around
with something.

01:06:59.459 --> 01:07:01.779
I just haven't found it yet.

01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:03.699
Look, I read about this fella,

01:07:03.739 --> 01:07:07.060
he used to push
a wheelbarrow full of cow dung...

01:07:07.179 --> 01:07:09.100
across the border every day.

01:07:09.179 --> 01:07:11.380
"Manure for the garden, " he'd say.
Went on for months.

01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:14.259
And the border guards knew
he was smuggling something,

01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:16.900
so they'd stop him and rake through
that manure with a fine-tooth comb.

01:07:16.979 --> 01:07:19.660
Never found a thing.

01:07:19.739 --> 01:07:23.300
Turned out they were right.
He was smuggling something:

01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:25.580
wheelbarrows.

01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:28.219
Right under their noses.

01:07:28.259 --> 01:07:32.620
See, it's there, and I'm just
not seeing it... yet. But I will.

01:07:33.979 --> 01:07:38.060
Nah. I reckon he was right
the first time. It's drugs.

01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:41.140
They wouldn't go to all
that trouble for wheelbarrows.

01:07:52.459 --> 01:07:54.939
Cut! And print.

01:07:55.019 --> 01:07:57.739
We'll cut when he throws,
so that'll work fine.

01:07:57.820 --> 01:07:59.660

- Well done, Paul.

01:07:59.739 --> 01:08:03.259

That means everyone goes home early
and has tomorrow off.

- Whoo! All right!
- Okay, see you all Friday!

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:13.380
First thing!

01:08:25.578 --> 01:08:29.219
[ Man ] And you've actually seen
these paintings quite recently.

01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:30.618
Yeah, today.

01:08:30.658 --> 01:08:33.779
Well, then that makes it easy.
They're fakes.

01:08:33.859 --> 01:08:36.259
You can tell that
from the photographs?

01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:39.540
Well, normally, no.
But, you see, these Rembrandts...

01:08:39.578 --> 01:08:42.179
and this, The Olive Field
by Van Gogh,

01:08:42.259 --> 01:08:44.179
unfortunately no longer exist.

01:08:44.219 --> 01:08:47.460
During the bombing
of Belgrade by NATO,

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:50.300
the National Art Museum of Serbia
took a direct hit,

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:53.578
burned to the ground along with
the originals of these paintings...

01:08:53.658 --> 01:08:58.059
and possibly the finest collection
of old masters in Eastern Europe.

01:08:58.139 --> 01:09:00.618
It was a tragedy
for the art world.

01:09:00.698 --> 01:09:04.658
Ergo, these must be copies, fakes.

01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:10.738
That, um, Belgrade,
is that in Yugoslavia?

01:09:12.219 --> 01:09:16.500
- Yeah.
- Where these paintings come from.

01:09:18.219 --> 01:09:20.658
What if it wasn't
an accidental bombing...

01:09:20.738 --> 01:09:23.618
and someone removed
the paintings first?

01:09:23.698 --> 01:09:26.059
Spoils of war?

01:09:27.578 --> 01:09:32.340
Maybe I should take a look at these.
Could you take me to them?

01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:35.460
That's probably impossible.

01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:39.899
But if I could get one of them
and bring it to you and it was real,

01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:41.939
that means the rest
are probably real, right?

01:09:42.059 --> 01:09:45.340
You must call me the minute
you find one. I have to see them.

01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:48.578
- No worries.
- Thank you. Thank you.

01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:55.699
- Hey, who drew this?
- Pablo Picasso.

01:09:57.139 --> 01:10:00.779
I'm a drinking man myself,
but I've never been that hammered.

- Wait in the car.
- Uh, Mick?

01:10:16.699 --> 01:10:18.739
I was gonna say, "Be careful, "

01:10:18.779 --> 01:10:22.619
but I guess that's kind of a dumb thing
to say to someone who hunts crocodiles.

01:10:22.699 --> 01:10:24.619
No worries.

01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:37.699
Of course the difference
is obvious here,

but on film,
it's a perfect match.

01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:43.259

God is in the details.

01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:55.420
