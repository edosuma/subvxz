00:03.871 --> 00:07.241
[theme music]

00:46.680 --> 00:48.682
[laughing]

00:49.683 --> 00:53.053
[music playing]

00:58.726 --> 01:00.060
That's more like it.

01:00.161 --> 01:01.529
Mom, the bathrooms are done.

01:01.629 --> 01:03.131
But nobody can use
them till Grandpa

01:03.231 --> 01:04.232
gets here tomorrow night.

01:04.332 --> 01:05.666
Well, how about we
don't use them all year,

01:05.766 --> 01:08.102
and then we never
have to clean them?

01:08.202 --> 01:09.603
Hey, look, I found a quarter.

01:09.703 --> 01:10.504
That's mine.

01:10.604 --> 01:11.405
I lost it.

01:11.505 --> 01:12.973
Finders keepers.

01:13.073 --> 01:16.076
Hey, Darlene, I found 5
bucks under your bed yesterday.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.245
What?

01:17.345 --> 01:18.146
Tell her, DJ.

01:18.246 --> 01:21.048
Finders keepers.

01:21.149 --> 01:25.253
Oh, no, don't tell me
the maid didn't show up.

01:25.353 --> 01:26.687
Great news, Dan.

01:26.787 --> 01:28.356
My Dad's decided not
to come for the weekend.

01:28.456 --> 01:29.257
ROSEANNE: [laughs]

01:29.357 --> 01:30.158
Right.

01:30.258 --> 01:31.359
He's coming for the whole week.

01:31.459 --> 01:32.960
Are you kidding me?

01:33.060 --> 01:34.128
- Right.
- I--

01:34.228 --> 01:35.028
ROSEANNE: [laughs]

01:35.129 --> 01:35.929
I hate you.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.802
OK, you guys,
when I get back, I

01:41.902 --> 01:46.774
wanna see this room like I left
it this morning, only clean.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.509
I already did my share.

01:48.609 --> 01:49.943
How come I always
have to help them?

01:50.043 --> 01:50.944
Because you're the oldest.

01:51.044 --> 01:53.581
DARLENE AND DJ: Ha, ha.

01:53.681 --> 01:56.016
And cause I pay you
twice as much allowance.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.451
DARLENE AND DJ: What?

01:57.551 --> 01:58.386
Ha, ha.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.524
Hey, what you reading, handsome?

02:03.624 --> 02:05.459
How to fix a cement finisher.

02:05.559 --> 02:09.763
Oh, yeah, I think I
saw that movie, Dan.

02:09.863 --> 02:11.699
Isn't that the one
where the son hides out

02:11.799 --> 02:13.834
in the garage all
weekend fixing the cement

02:13.934 --> 02:16.470
finisher to avoid his father?

02:16.570 --> 02:17.838
Don't tell me how it ends.

02:20.708 --> 02:23.477
There is no end, Dan,
cause there's no beginning.

02:23.577 --> 02:26.079
If hiding out's your tactic
this year, it ain't gonna work.

02:26.180 --> 02:27.215
What tactic?

02:27.315 --> 02:28.849
I gotta finish the
cement finisher, don't I?

02:28.949 --> 02:30.884
ROSEANNE: Yeah, but, you know,
you've been talking about doing

02:30.984 --> 02:32.653
that for the past three months.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.688
Why don't you just break
down and buy a new one?

02:34.788 --> 02:35.989
[oven clicking]

02:36.089 --> 02:37.925
You got any idea how much
a new cement finisher costs?

02:38.025 --> 02:41.128
No, Dan, I missed this month's
copy of "Modern Pavement."

02:44.332 --> 02:47.935
What is it about Ed, "The Dad,"
Conner that drives you nuts?

02:48.035 --> 02:49.102
Haven't you ever
heard of a father

02:49.203 --> 02:50.604
and son not getting along?

02:50.704 --> 02:51.839
Yeah, I hear it
all the time, Dan.

02:51.939 --> 02:52.940
I'm tired of it.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.808
He's a sweet man.

02:54.908 --> 02:56.109
He's a little overbearing.

02:56.210 --> 02:57.845
But this family is all he has.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.313
Yeah, and he's gonna
spend a whole weekend

02:59.413 --> 03:01.081
telling me how to run it.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.250
Oh, you run this family?

03:05.486 --> 03:06.754
I mean it, Rose.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.322
He's gonna walk in here, and
he's gonna tell me I'm wasting

03:08.422 --> 03:10.057
my time as a contractor.

03:10.157 --> 03:12.993
He's gonna say, "Work
smart, Danny, not hard."

03:13.093 --> 03:14.395
So why don't you
give yourself a break.

03:14.495 --> 03:16.597
You handle him smart, not hard.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.166
Well, it's easier
than it sounds.

03:19.267 --> 03:22.303
Look, I'm sorry to say it, but
he really gets on my nerves.

03:22.403 --> 03:23.871
Yeah, but these
visits are really

03:23.971 --> 03:25.205
important to your dad, Dan.

03:25.306 --> 03:26.106
[sighs]

03:26.206 --> 03:27.007
I know.

03:27.107 --> 03:28.842
I'm being silly.

03:28.942 --> 03:31.979
Well, anyway, he's only
gonna be here 72 hours.

03:32.079 --> 03:36.617
Flies live out their entire
lifespan in 72 hours.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.319
So maybe he'll get cut
caught in the screen door,

03:38.419 --> 03:41.021
and he'll be here forever.

03:41.121 --> 03:44.825
[music playing]

03:47.828 --> 03:49.196
Hey, lover boy.

03:49.297 --> 03:50.331
I'm ready for him.

03:50.431 --> 03:53.233
I told you I was gonna
make this weekend work.

03:53.334 --> 03:56.236
Bottle of Gold Premium, his
favorite, sodium-free club

03:56.337 --> 03:57.371
soda.

03:57.471 --> 04:00.441
And here's the clincher,
Clark's gourmet cashews.

04:00.541 --> 04:01.442
[horn honking]

04:02.510 --> 04:03.911
DJ: Wow, Grandpa.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.946
How come they never run
like that when I come home?

04:06.046 --> 04:06.914
They do, Dan.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.782
It's just in the
opposite direction.

04:11.485 --> 04:12.620
Come on.
It's gonna work out great.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.855
Don't worry.
- Oh, that's the spirit, honey.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.924
Remember, he's your
father and he loves you.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.560
And when that fly
dies, he's outta here.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.429
Hon, the house looks great.

04:21.529 --> 04:23.431
Yeah, we should enjoy
it now cause it won't look

04:23.531 --> 04:25.366
like this till DJ moves out.

04:25.466 --> 04:26.434
Come on, Grandpa.

04:26.534 --> 04:27.335
[laughing]

04:27.435 --> 04:29.169
DJ, quit pulling.

04:29.269 --> 04:33.240
D-- Darlene, are you
sure you can handle that?

04:33.341 --> 04:34.442
DARLENE: No problem, Grandpa.

04:34.542 --> 04:35.909
[giggling]

04:36.009 --> 04:37.678
Now what did I tell
you kids about letting

04:37.778 --> 04:39.413
strangers in the house?

04:39.513 --> 04:41.515
I am no stranger than
the guy you married.

04:41.615 --> 04:42.416
[chuckles]

04:42.516 --> 04:43.384
Rosebud.

04:43.484 --> 04:44.818
Ah.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.320
The daughter I never had.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.522
Yeah, well, Ed, you
would've died in labor.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.427
How's it going, Dad?

04:53.527 --> 04:55.429
Danny, Danny,
Danny, I didn't drive

04:55.529 --> 04:58.466
320 miles for a handshake.

04:58.566 --> 04:59.367
How bout a google.

04:59.467 --> 05:00.334
Come here.
- Ah!

05:00.434 --> 05:01.234
Ah.

05:01.335 --> 05:02.135
Ah!

05:05.606 --> 05:07.875
See, that's my little boy.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.878
DAN AND ED: [laughing]

05:11.779 --> 05:12.580
Whoa!

05:12.680 --> 05:13.481
Whoa!

05:13.581 --> 05:16.550
DAN AND ED: [laughing]

05:17.050 --> 05:17.718
Oh.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.019
How you been, Dad.

05:19.119 --> 05:20.153
I been great, son.
I been great.

05:20.253 --> 05:21.221
How about you?
How's it going?

05:21.321 --> 05:22.523
Oh, great, great.
Business is terrific.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.057
- Good.
- You look great.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.559
I'm feeling great, son.

05:25.659 --> 05:26.694
Hey, tell Grandpa.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.762
I got something
for you, Grandpa.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.964
ED: Well, I have got
something for you too.

05:31.064 --> 05:33.567
Uh, Darlene, you think you
can get that suitcase open?

05:33.667 --> 05:36.303
Now listen, I want
you to take very

05:36.404 --> 05:38.472
good care of that, all right?

05:38.572 --> 05:40.408
That is genuine camel's hair.

05:40.508 --> 05:41.909
Oh, so it won't
need much water.

05:44.512 --> 05:45.446
Here ya go, sport.

05:45.546 --> 05:46.346
[laughs]

05:46.447 --> 05:47.280
Thanks.

05:47.381 --> 05:49.149
Well.

05:49.249 --> 05:50.418
Let's see, Darlene.

05:50.518 --> 05:51.318
Darlene?

05:51.419 --> 05:52.720
Any Darlenes in this house?

05:52.820 --> 05:53.621
Right here.

05:53.721 --> 05:55.055
Oh, there you go.

05:55.155 --> 05:56.424
Wow--
ROSEANNE: Wow.

05:56.524 --> 05:57.357
--an ant farm.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.559
ED: No, no, it's no farm.

05:58.659 --> 05:59.627
That's a condo.

05:59.727 --> 06:00.528
Yeah.

06:00.628 --> 06:02.029
You see, that's an ant condo.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.297
There's a little health club
for them on the top floor.

06:04.398 --> 06:06.299
So they can bulk up
and become roaches.

06:09.737 --> 06:11.238
What about me, Grandpa?

06:11.338 --> 06:12.740
What about you, honey?

06:12.840 --> 06:14.875
You know.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.677
Know what?

06:16.777 --> 06:18.245
Grandpa, where's my present?

06:18.345 --> 06:19.246
[gasps]

06:19.346 --> 06:21.281
Oh, no.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.883
Oh, I knew I was
gonna forget somebody.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.184
Oh, oh.
- Grandpa.

06:24.284 --> 06:25.986
Oh, there's gotta be
something here somewhere,

06:26.086 --> 06:27.821
something, some one last thing.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.590
I just-- aw.

06:29.690 --> 06:30.524
[laughs]

06:30.624 --> 06:32.460
See, that's a diary.

06:32.560 --> 06:37.030
You wear the key close to your
heart so it won't be read by--

06:37.130 --> 06:38.398
Thanks, Grandpa.

06:38.499 --> 06:39.967
Yours is in the mail.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.570
Oh, Ed, you know you don't
have to bring us anything.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.905
As soon as you leave,
we take their stuff.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.373
[laughs]

06:47.374 --> 06:49.176
Hey, Dad, I--

06:49.276 --> 06:51.011
I got a little something
for you out in the kitchen.

06:51.111 --> 06:53.614
Son, you don't have
to get anything for me.

06:53.714 --> 06:55.248
See, Dan, I told
you he doesn't want

06:55.348 --> 06:58.051
that cash gift of over $10,000.

06:58.151 --> 06:59.052
[scoffs]

07:00.087 --> 07:01.121
Grandpa, show
me how these work.

07:01.221 --> 07:02.189
OK, here.

07:02.289 --> 07:04.458
You see, you are under arrest.

07:04.558 --> 07:05.959
But-- but, oh, no.
Ho-ho.

07:06.059 --> 07:06.860
Cool.

07:06.960 --> 07:07.928
Let me try.

07:08.028 --> 07:08.862
[chuckles]

07:09.930 --> 07:11.398
You know, Darlene,
I got a feeling

07:11.499 --> 07:13.767
you're gonna have an even
nicer pair of those someday.

07:20.073 --> 07:21.475
I don't know
how you two do it.

07:21.575 --> 07:22.976
How about it, Dad?

07:23.076 --> 07:24.044
Gold Premium?

07:24.144 --> 07:25.445
That's the best there is.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.180
DAN: Yeah, it'd go pretty good
with those cashews over there.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.483
ED: Oh-ho, somebody's living
the high life around here.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.383
Who?

07:33.386 --> 07:35.589
Uh, Ed, why don't you just
go ahead and open them up?

07:35.689 --> 07:37.090
Sure, Rosie, right way.

07:37.190 --> 07:38.892
Danny, how much did
ya pay for these?

07:38.992 --> 07:40.027
[clears throat]

07:40.127 --> 07:42.496
Whatever it was, I'm
sure it was too much.

07:42.596 --> 07:43.764
You know the deals my dad gets.

07:43.864 --> 07:47.234
When you got friends,
you never pay retail.

07:47.334 --> 07:48.836
So you don't mean to
tell me you actually have

07:48.936 --> 07:50.403
friends in the nut business?

07:50.504 --> 07:55.643
Nuts, cookies, candies,
lighters, pens, tongs.

07:55.743 --> 07:56.777
[laughs]

07:56.877 --> 07:59.547
ED: You never pay full
price for that stuff.

07:59.647 --> 08:00.814
[knocking on door]

08:00.914 --> 08:01.715
DARLENE: I got it.

08:01.815 --> 08:02.616
Take my car.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.284
800 bucks off the list price.

08:04.384 --> 08:06.954
ED: Right, and they also
threw in a digital radio.

08:07.054 --> 08:08.956
And you know why?

08:09.056 --> 08:10.357
You're friends
with the salesman.

08:10.457 --> 08:12.325
That's right, Danny Boy.

08:12.425 --> 08:13.493
CRYSTAL: Hey, everybody.

08:13.594 --> 08:14.595
Hey.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.229
- Hope I'm not interrupting.
- Hey, Crystal.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.130
Crystal, you remember Ed.

08:17.230 --> 08:20.568
My, my, my, take
my breath away.

08:20.668 --> 08:21.769
Well, hello, Ed.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.103
[laughs]

08:23.203 --> 08:24.938
There must be something
in the Lanford water,

08:25.038 --> 08:27.875
because you get prettier
every time I see you.

08:27.975 --> 08:30.410
CRYSTAL: And every time I
see you, you have more charm.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.746
- He gets it wholesale.
- [laughs]

08:34.748 --> 08:36.617
CRYSTAL: Roseanne,
I got an emergency.

08:36.717 --> 08:37.818
My hairdryer's busted.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.119
The darn thing's
supposed to have three

08:39.219 --> 08:40.954
settings, cool, warm, and hot.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.123
But all I could get
was cool, hot, and hot.

08:43.223 --> 08:45.392
You got one I could borrow?

08:45.492 --> 08:46.760
Nah.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.797
Jeez, I wish I knew somebody
that could get me a good deal

08:49.897 --> 08:51.164
on one of those darn things.

08:55.068 --> 08:59.673
1971, hairdryers, West
Coast distributorship.

08:59.773 --> 09:02.009
I was this close,
Danny, this close.

09:02.109 --> 09:03.310
[sighs]

09:03.877 --> 09:04.678
[sighs]

09:04.778 --> 09:05.646
ED: [chuckles]

09:05.746 --> 09:07.114
Your Cubs are looking
good this year.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.281
Yeah, they are.
Yeah, they are.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.282
ED: Mm.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.584
Of course, it's still
spring training.

09:10.684 --> 09:11.484
DAN: I don't know.

09:11.585 --> 09:12.720
They could be contenders.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.722
Well, everybody's a
contender in spring training.

09:14.822 --> 09:16.023
[laughs]

09:17.390 --> 09:19.660
Cement finisher
maintenance manual.

09:19.760 --> 09:20.661
Oh, that-- that's nothing.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.596
Uh, cement finisher's
acting up again.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.097
Seems to me that
thing is always broken.

09:24.197 --> 09:24.998
Nah, nah.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.269
How's business, Dad?

09:29.369 --> 09:30.503
Never better.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.906
I'm selling forklifts faster
than they can make them.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.642
[chuckles]
Good for you, Dad.

09:34.742 --> 09:35.709
ED: [laughs]

09:35.809 --> 09:37.044
They're trying to
stick me with this punk

09:37.144 --> 09:41.248
kid who couldn't sell a life
preserver to a drowning man.

09:41.348 --> 09:42.650
And I told the sales manager.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.818
I said, if I had my son with me,
we could put this company right

09:44.918 --> 09:46.186
through the top.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.755
Aw, I don't need you talking
to no sales manager for me,

09:47.855 --> 09:48.722
Dad.

09:48.822 --> 09:49.890
We've been over this
a million times.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.158
I ain't no salesman.
- [sighs]

09:52.159 --> 09:52.993
Well, yeah.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.495
The world needs handymen too.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.697
I'm not a handyman, Dad.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.031
I'm a contractor.
ED: [sighs]

09:58.131 --> 09:58.932
You could be a salesman.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.433
You could be a damn good one.

10:00.533 --> 10:01.401
I like what I do.

10:01.501 --> 10:02.636
I didn't say you didn't, son.

10:02.736 --> 10:05.138
All I am saying is you
gotta work smart, not hard.

10:05.238 --> 10:07.040
Work smart, not hard.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.909
Dad, I'm building a business
here, and it takes time.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.210
I mean, uh--
ED: Well, what are you building?

10:10.310 --> 10:11.611
What-- I mean,
you're a contractor.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.313
What do you work, six
months outta the year?

10:13.413 --> 10:15.382
Well, yeah, we're a little
slow during the wintertime,

10:15.482 --> 10:16.283
but--

10:16.383 --> 10:17.384
That's what I'm talking about.

10:17.484 --> 10:18.752
Well, I got stuff lined up.

10:18.852 --> 10:19.787
ED: What are you-- lined up?

10:19.887 --> 10:20.888
Son, you have a family here.

10:20.988 --> 10:22.522
You gotta line something
up for this family.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.257
Hey, I take good
care of my family.

10:24.357 --> 10:25.358
ED: I know you do, son.
I know you do.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.259
No, you don't know.

10:26.359 --> 10:27.160
You don't know.

10:27.260 --> 10:28.061
I ain't a salesman.

10:28.161 --> 10:28.962
I'm a contractor.

10:29.062 --> 10:30.030
And let's drop it.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.733
Fine.

10:32.833 --> 10:33.633
Bye-bye, Ed.

10:33.734 --> 10:34.902
ED: Bye-bye, sugar.

10:35.002 --> 10:37.070
You keep drinking that water.

10:37.170 --> 10:40.040
DARLENE: Grandpa, I can't find
the key for these handcuffs.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.074
They don't need a key.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.209
[groans]

10:42.309 --> 10:44.912
I'll show you again, but
this is the last time.

10:45.012 --> 10:46.046
ROSEANNE: All
right, what'd he do?

10:46.146 --> 10:49.216
He did exactly what
I said he was gonna do.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.751
He's not here five
minutes, and I'm a handyman

10:50.851 --> 10:51.719
who can't support his family.

10:51.819 --> 10:52.853
ROSEANNE: Well,
Dan, did you try--

10:52.953 --> 10:54.221
I don't wanna talk
about it, Roseanne.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.289
He just better stay the hell
out of my way this whole visit.

10:56.389 --> 10:58.759
I don't care if I
ever see him again.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.227
[footsteps]

11:01.294 --> 11:02.195
[door slams]

11:02.295 --> 11:03.530
[sighs]

11:03.630 --> 11:06.366
I guess I really messed things
up this time, huh, Rosie?

11:06.466 --> 11:08.168
Yeah, Ed, it's
all over your shoes.

11:11.739 --> 11:12.973
Here, ant.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.108
Come and get it.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.744
What are you guys doing?

11:16.844 --> 11:19.646
Me and DJ's trapping
ants for his ant condo.

11:19.747 --> 11:21.882
We put jelly on
bread, Grandpa.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.183
Yeah, then when
the ants come out,

11:23.283 --> 11:27.054
we smash them over the
head with a two by four,

11:27.154 --> 11:29.957
same way I caught Dan.

11:30.057 --> 11:31.491
Yeah, where is Danny Boy?

11:31.591 --> 11:33.226
I thought for sure
he'd be out here.

11:33.326 --> 11:36.196
Well, he went out
for a glass of coolant.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.065
Oh, no.

11:38.165 --> 11:40.033
He's really got
some temper, huh?

11:40.133 --> 11:41.969
Only on special occasions.

11:44.838 --> 11:45.939
Hey, where are you going?

11:46.039 --> 11:47.908
Somebody's gotta stay in
here and catch these ants.

11:48.008 --> 11:49.777
You can.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.278
Gee, thanks.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.080
Got a great kid there.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.448
Yeah, he's great
when he's not rotten.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.550
There's no such thing
as a rotten son, Rosie.

11:57.650 --> 11:58.585
I know.
It--

11:58.685 --> 11:59.586
Yeah, they're too
precious, you know?

11:59.686 --> 12:00.821
I don't know about
mothers and sons.

12:00.921 --> 12:02.589
But with fathers and sons--
[laughs sarcastically]

12:02.689 --> 12:05.292
A father looks at his son,
and he sees every mistake

12:05.392 --> 12:06.593
he ever made, you know.

12:06.693 --> 12:08.428
He just-- he just wants to
put him on some kind of path

12:08.528 --> 12:09.930
where he won't make
those same mistakes.

12:10.030 --> 12:10.931
ROSEANNE: Yeah, but, Ed, you--

12:11.031 --> 12:11.899
No, a father and a son--

12:11.999 --> 12:13.867
I mean, you see
what would've, what

12:13.967 --> 12:15.068
could've, what should've been.
- Ed.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.469
I--

12:16.569 --> 12:21.041
Ed, when you're on the phone,
do you ever use the top half?

12:21.141 --> 12:22.309
Oh, oh, yeah, OK.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.277
Uh, well, yeah, I run off at
the mouth sometime, Rosie,

12:24.377 --> 12:25.645
but so do you.

12:25.745 --> 12:30.818
Yeah, but when I speak, I'm
speaking for all of womankind.

12:30.918 --> 12:33.954
What does all of womankind
know about fathers and sons?

12:34.054 --> 12:36.389
All I was doing was giving
Danny a little fatherly advice.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.591
But that's the thing
about fatherly advice, Ed.

12:38.691 --> 12:40.427
I mean, it's a give
and take kind of thing.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.529
You can only give it
so much before the kid

12:42.629 --> 12:46.099
can't take it anymore.

12:46.199 --> 12:46.967
Yeah, but--

12:47.067 --> 12:48.101
Yeah, but--

12:48.201 --> 12:49.336
- You know--
- You know--

12:49.436 --> 12:50.637
[sighs]

12:50.737 --> 12:51.638
You should go talk to him.

12:51.738 --> 12:52.539
--talk to him.

12:52.639 --> 12:53.506
Yeah, OK.

13:03.216 --> 13:04.217
The world still out there?

13:11.524 --> 13:17.931
Hey, Danny, you remember 1962,
Wrigley Field, opening day?

13:18.031 --> 13:20.633
You were there.

13:20.733 --> 13:21.835
Who's on the mound?

13:21.935 --> 13:22.735
The pitcher.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.542
You don't know, do you?

13:29.642 --> 13:30.710
It's a big guy, right-hander.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.246
I'm-- I really can't
think of his name.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.648
Neither can I.

13:35.748 --> 13:36.649
[sighs]

13:38.251 --> 13:40.587
You know, I once had
this fight with this guy,

13:40.687 --> 13:42.389
Earl Veltoff.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.557
He and I were partners
out in Des Moines for--

13:44.657 --> 13:46.826
I don't know-- three weeks.

13:46.927 --> 13:49.096
He had the most annoying habit.

13:49.196 --> 13:50.263
He used to suck his teeth.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.966
[sucks teeth]

13:53.066 --> 13:55.668
Cardwell was on the
mound, Don Cardwell.

13:55.768 --> 13:58.371
ED: That's the guy.

13:58.471 --> 13:59.272
Yeah.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.108
We almost got a foul ball.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.043
This close, this close.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.978
Yeah, we would've had
it too if you hadn't have

14:05.078 --> 14:06.413
been yakking to the
people behind us

14:06.513 --> 14:08.315
about the invention
of the forklift.

14:08.415 --> 14:09.216
True.

14:09.316 --> 14:10.117
[chuckles]

14:11.151 --> 14:13.353
You know what this
is like, Danny?

14:13.453 --> 14:16.456
This is like ants.

14:16.556 --> 14:17.524
What's like ants?

14:17.624 --> 14:19.626
What the hell are
you're talking about?

14:19.726 --> 14:21.161
You and me.

14:21.261 --> 14:24.597
When an insect
threatens an anthill,

14:24.697 --> 14:28.068
the ants instinctively protect
those they're related to.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.569
That's nature.

14:29.669 --> 14:31.038
That's life.

14:31.138 --> 14:31.939
That's dinner.

14:32.039 --> 14:33.974
I'll see ya.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.008
Hey, Danny.

14:35.108 --> 14:36.576
DAN: What?
- [sighs]

14:36.676 --> 14:38.145
Well, I came in here to
square things with you.

14:38.245 --> 14:39.179
Why are you making it so tough?

14:42.149 --> 14:43.016
We're square, Pop.

14:46.619 --> 14:48.555
Cardwell was knocked
out in the first.

14:48.655 --> 14:49.822
Who'd they bring in?

14:49.923 --> 14:51.891
Bob Buhl.

14:51.992 --> 14:55.262
[music playing]

14:59.699 --> 15:03.103
1956, ho-ho, that was a year.

15:03.203 --> 15:04.437
Pass the potatoes, please.
ED: [chuckling]

15:04.537 --> 15:06.173
Something almost happened
in 1956-- we wouldn't

15:06.273 --> 15:07.607
be sitting around here today.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.242
Do beets stain your teeth?

15:09.342 --> 15:10.143
[chuckles]

15:10.243 --> 15:11.578
We were on the road to Memphis.

15:11.678 --> 15:12.845
You were about three
years old, Danny.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.014
You remember that?
- Vividly

15:14.114 --> 15:14.914
ED: [chuckles]

15:15.015 --> 15:16.449
It was raining cats and dogs.

15:16.549 --> 15:18.285
And the windshield
wipers up front there,

15:18.385 --> 15:19.752
they're just working
like a charm.

15:19.852 --> 15:21.021
And I said to your
mother, I said,

15:21.121 --> 15:24.457
Audrey, I'm gonna revolutionize
the automobile industry,

15:24.557 --> 15:27.127
an idea as simple as
a hula hoop and as

15:27.227 --> 15:28.628
practical as a paper clip.

15:28.728 --> 15:29.862
Who knows what it is?

15:29.963 --> 15:30.863
Mud flaps?

15:30.964 --> 15:31.764
ED: No.

15:31.864 --> 15:32.865
Well, that's pretty good.

15:32.966 --> 15:34.667
But now-- now-- now,
see-- see, try to think

15:34.767 --> 15:36.369
about the rear of the car.

15:36.469 --> 15:37.804
ROSEANNE: Well, now,
Ed, the only thing

15:37.904 --> 15:39.539
I can think of that you
do in the rear of a car,

15:39.639 --> 15:40.840
I know you didn't invent.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.079
Rear windshield wipers.

15:46.179 --> 15:49.216
Give this young lady
64 silver dollars.

15:49.316 --> 15:51.384
You invented rear
windshield wipers?

15:51.484 --> 15:53.086
Could've, should've, would've.

15:53.186 --> 15:54.887
(LAUGHING) Boy, I'm telling you.

15:54.988 --> 15:58.325
But your mother, she
had to have a rest stop.

15:58.425 --> 16:00.593
Well, casting no
aspersions, she was eight

16:00.693 --> 16:01.861
months pregnant at the time.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.496
She was a little incontinent,
if you know what I mean.

16:03.596 --> 16:04.597
[chuckles]

16:04.697 --> 16:07.267
So we stop, and I lose
my train of thought.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.636
It wasn't till two year
later, till I see a pair

16:09.736 --> 16:11.404
on the back end of
a Chrysler Imperial,

16:11.504 --> 16:13.906
I remember I invented them.

16:14.007 --> 16:16.476
This close, Danny, this close.

16:16.576 --> 16:17.644
Well, I learned my lesson.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.179
You gotta grab
your opportunities

16:19.279 --> 16:20.347
when they come by.

16:20.447 --> 16:22.549
Darlene, pass
the beets, please.

16:22.649 --> 16:23.550
Well, do they?

16:23.650 --> 16:24.817
Do they what?

16:24.917 --> 16:26.019
- Stain your teeth.
- Teeth--

16:26.119 --> 16:27.454
[chuckles]
--let me tell you about teeth.

16:27.554 --> 16:28.755
Dad.

16:28.855 --> 16:30.990
ED: The most beautiful teeth
I ever saw were on a movie

16:31.091 --> 16:32.459
star, Esther Williams.

16:32.559 --> 16:34.861
DAN: Dad, we've already
heard this story.

16:34.961 --> 16:35.928
I haven't.

16:36.029 --> 16:38.165
Yeah, I'd like to hear it.

16:38.265 --> 16:40.833
OK, great, tell it.

16:40.933 --> 16:42.001
You're in San Diego.

16:42.102 --> 16:43.436
It's 1951.

16:43.536 --> 16:46.139
Bobby Thomson's home run,
shot heard round the world.

16:46.239 --> 16:47.240
Let him tell it.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.209
No, no, no, it's-- it's OK.

16:49.309 --> 16:52.279
MGM's making a movie
down in San Diego, see?

16:52.379 --> 16:53.446
And guess who's down there?

16:53.546 --> 16:54.481
Esther Williams.

16:54.581 --> 16:57.250
Give the young lady
64 silver dollars.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.686
Well, then what happened?

16:59.786 --> 17:00.720
Ask your father.

17:00.820 --> 17:01.788
DAN: You're in the coffee shop.

17:01.888 --> 17:02.722
No, no.

17:02.822 --> 17:04.023
No, I was in the
main dining room.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.258
I turned around.
I couldn't find my--

17:05.358 --> 17:06.593
(LAUGHING) He's gonna tell it.
He's gonna tell it.

17:06.693 --> 17:07.927
[laughing]

17:08.027 --> 17:09.496
Well, Dan, it's
not like we haven't

17:09.596 --> 17:11.131
heard your stories 30 times.

17:11.231 --> 17:12.365
What stories?

17:12.465 --> 17:13.933
Uh, oh, come on, Dan.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.536
How many times have I listened
to the incredible story

17:16.636 --> 17:18.438
about how you were the
first customer ever

17:18.538 --> 17:19.672
at the new supermarket?

17:24.977 --> 17:26.779
I'll tell you, Dan, if you
don't wanna hear my stories,

17:26.879 --> 17:28.281
you don't have to
hear my stories.

17:28.381 --> 17:31.084
As a matter of fact, you can
freeze in hell before you

17:31.184 --> 17:32.119
hear another one of my stories.

17:32.219 --> 17:33.019
Excuse me.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.087
Come on, sit down.

17:34.187 --> 17:36.389
Dan, cool it.

17:36.489 --> 17:37.924
I'll take care of it.
I got us into this.

17:38.024 --> 17:38.825
I'll get us out of it.

17:38.925 --> 17:40.693
Well, Ed, you're half right.

17:40.793 --> 17:42.895
You got us into it, and
I'll get us out of it.

17:49.836 --> 17:50.637
Dan.

17:54.107 --> 17:57.076
You know, the statute of
limitations on parental crime

17:57.177 --> 18:00.513
runs out when you're about 30.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.815
So he didn't invent the
rear windshield wiper.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.251
That's not it.

18:04.351 --> 18:06.953
So he never really
met Esther Williams.

18:07.053 --> 18:08.788
It's not the
windshield wipers.

18:08.888 --> 18:12.225
It's not Esther Williams.

18:12.325 --> 18:13.293
It's his fork.

18:13.393 --> 18:14.194
ROSEANNE: What?

18:16.796 --> 18:18.398
He holds his fork
the same way I do.

18:18.498 --> 18:19.866
I hold my fork the
same way he does.

18:19.966 --> 18:20.767
I'm him.

18:24.704 --> 18:25.838
I think you're
reading a little bit

18:25.938 --> 18:29.776
too much into silverware.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.511
I'm sitting there at
the kitchen table, honey,

18:31.611 --> 18:34.747
and I'm watching him,
and I'm listening.

18:34.847 --> 18:38.017
And it's me, and I hate it.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.919
Well, you know, Dan, if
you didn't know Ed Conner

18:40.019 --> 18:43.323
and you just bumped into him,
you'd go have a couple of beers

18:43.423 --> 18:44.957
and you'd talk about
baseball, and he'd

18:45.057 --> 18:46.092
probably sell you a forklift.

18:48.728 --> 18:51.030
You know what
scares me the most?

18:51.130 --> 18:54.934
It's when he was 36 years old,
he's right where I am today.

18:55.034 --> 18:56.536
That's me down the road.

18:56.636 --> 18:57.804
No, that's him.

18:57.904 --> 18:58.838
Those are his choices.

18:58.938 --> 18:59.906
That's Ed.

19:00.006 --> 19:02.309
DAN: Roseanne, I got
a broken-down truck,

19:02.409 --> 19:03.910
I got a broken-down
cement finisher.

19:04.010 --> 19:07.280
I hear myself telling the
same damn stories 12 times.

19:07.380 --> 19:11.150
Yeah, well, I'm not
saying you're not boring.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.219
[laughs]

19:13.720 --> 19:16.122
You know, you're just boring in
a different way than your Dad.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.327
[sighs]

19:20.427 --> 19:21.294
It genetic.

19:21.394 --> 19:23.029
It's in the genes.

19:23.129 --> 19:26.566
You see him, you get me.

19:26.666 --> 19:27.567
[sighs]

19:27.667 --> 19:30.237
Well, maybe that's
why I like him.

19:30.337 --> 19:36.209
You know, he has that certain
virile Conner charm, you know?

19:36.309 --> 19:37.577
Come back in there with me.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.746
Come on.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.481
Yeah, we might be
missing a good story.

19:48.588 --> 19:51.391
Allow me to introduce,
making yet another appearance

19:51.491 --> 19:53.025
at our dinner
table this evening,

19:53.125 --> 19:56.229
the lovely, the
indefatigable Mr. Dan Connor

19:56.329 --> 19:57.364
and his lovely wife, Tammy.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.401
Now, where were we?

20:01.501 --> 20:04.437
I asked for the potatoes,
and you hit the road.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.539
Well, ask him for the
carrots and see what happens.

20:06.639 --> 20:07.440
[scoffs]

20:08.808 --> 20:09.942
Carrots.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.678
I hate carrots.

20:11.778 --> 20:14.614
You know why?

20:14.714 --> 20:15.615
Tell me.

20:20.687 --> 20:22.689
DAN: [groaning]

20:23.923 --> 20:27.093
Would you stop hogging
all of these blankets?

20:27.193 --> 20:28.461
Blankets?

20:28.561 --> 20:30.129
Let me tell you a little
something about blankets.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.398
[laughs]

20:31.498 --> 20:33.333
I came this close to an
eventing the blanket in 1969.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.435
It was right after Woodstock.

20:35.535 --> 20:36.436
And a guy from--

20:36.536 --> 20:37.970
that guy named
Navajo Joe ups to me.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.105
[laughs]

20:39.205 --> 20:40.607
And he says, I already
invented the blanket.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.041
So I-- he took it away from me.

20:42.141 --> 20:43.776
1969, that was a
great year, wasn't it.

20:43.876 --> 20:44.611
- [snorts and laughs]
- Woodstock.

20:44.711 --> 20:45.478
Who was on the mound that year?

20:45.578 --> 20:46.413
Fergie Jenkins.

20:46.513 --> 20:47.880
Boy, what a set of
choppers he had.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.416
You talk about teeth.

20:49.516 --> 20:51.050
But he went plumb idjit on me.

20:51.150 --> 20:52.419
[laughing]

20:52.519 --> 20:56.088
And he went and, uh, sunk all
his money into a-- into what

20:56.188 --> 20:57.490
you call a hairdryer stock.

20:57.590 --> 21:00.026
He tried to invent a
five-speed, uh, [inaudible] mix,

21:00.126 --> 21:00.927
uh, hairdryer.

21:01.027 --> 21:03.696
And he lost all his dough, see?

21:03.796 --> 21:05.498
And, uh, then he couldn't
do nothing about it.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.066
So, uh, I-- so I ups to him.

21:07.166 --> 21:09.402
I says, Fergie,
what the heck do you

21:09.502 --> 21:11.170
know about hairdryers anyway?

21:11.270 --> 21:12.639
So he goes, well, it
gets windy in Chicago.

21:12.739 --> 21:13.540
[laughing].

21:13.640 --> 21:14.607
I said Chicago?

21:14.707 --> 21:15.642
Chicago?

21:15.742 --> 21:17.043
Yeah, I was almost
in the band Chicago.

21:17.143 --> 21:20.380
I used to mix their
soundtracks for them.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.248
But I couldn't
quite get it, see?

21:22.349 --> 21:24.751
Ah.

21:24.851 --> 21:26.218
Goodnight, Ed.

21:26.319 --> 21:27.454
Night.
Night?

21:27.554 --> 21:28.721
What the hell do you
know about night?

21:28.821 --> 21:29.656
[laughing]

21:29.756 --> 21:31.123
I was almost on
"The Edge of Night"

21:31.223 --> 21:34.361
one time, except I got my
foot cut off in Vietnam, see?

21:34.461 --> 21:36.896
And I couldn't-- I couldn't
quite make it to the audition.

21:36.996 --> 21:38.230
And the cab driver
didn't speak English.

21:38.331 --> 21:39.566
So he didn't know
what the heck he was--

21:39.666 --> 21:40.467
Shut up!

21:43.035 --> 21:44.371
I was shut up in
a cave one time.

21:44.471 --> 21:45.472
[laughing]

21:45.572 --> 21:47.840
Meramec Caverns, just
south of St. Louis.

21:47.940 --> 21:49.141
It was me and three other guys.

21:49.241 --> 21:52.579
We didn't have no oxygen.

21:52.679 --> 21:55.715
[music playing]
