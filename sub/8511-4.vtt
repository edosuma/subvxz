01:20.914 --> 01:23.155
Are you all right, stu?

01:26.378 --> 01:27.834
Yeah

01:29.381 --> 01:31.246
it's not me.

01:34.261 --> 01:36.468
I think it's Harold.

01:38.056 --> 01:40.172
Something happened to him.

01:52.487 --> 01:54.227
Harold: Nadine.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.610
Help me.

02:01.330 --> 02:03.412
Help me.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.744
Nadine:
You said it yourself, Harold.

02:08.503 --> 02:10.164
We're damned.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.622
You can't just leave me.

02:14.885 --> 02:17.752
You can't leave me.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.884
Nadine.

02:23.226 --> 02:26.343
You can't leave me.

02:26.521 --> 02:30.184
My ribs are broken. My leq.

02:30.359 --> 02:31.690
Come back.

02:48.460 --> 02:49.916
Harold: Come back

02:50.420 --> 02:52.502
come back.

02:53.048 --> 02:54.959
Nadine.

02:56.343 --> 02:57.549
Nadine.

03:02.099 --> 03:05.762
Nadine!

04:19.968 --> 04:22.254
You go out on me, Bobby Terry...

04:25.932 --> 04:27.888
- Gin.
- Ooh!

04:29.144 --> 04:30.680
Lloyd: Post 9, post 9,

04:30.771 --> 04:32.039
if you can hear me, come on back.

04:32.063 --> 04:34.099
- That's henreid.
- I know it is.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.817
I'm right here, Mr. henreid,

04:39.696 --> 04:42.813
but we haven't seen anything yet.
Not a single vehicle.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.198
Lloyd:
Well, keep your eyes open.

04:45.660 --> 04:48.743
And remember what I told you.
Don't Mark him.

04:48.914 --> 04:51.075
Right. I mean, copy.

04:51.249 --> 04:52.534
Lloyd: Just remember it

04:52.709 --> 04:55.997
we want all the people over there
to know exactly who they're looking at.

04:56.171 --> 04:57.377
So stay alert.

04:57.506 --> 04:59.588
Roger that.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.544
Oh, man.

05:05.222 --> 05:09.056
If black powder were brains,
that guy couldn't blow his nose.

05:11.061 --> 05:14.804
Dayna:
Lloyd, are you coming back?

05:15.524 --> 05:17.310
Oh, yeah.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.078
Hey.

05:37.587 --> 05:40.374
- Thought you were going to sleep.
- Mm_

05:40.507 --> 05:44.091
I might need a sleeping pill.

05:46.555 --> 05:48.637
Call me the doctor.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.569
Bobby:
You're the one that threw them.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.037
You should have to pick them up.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.823
You're just a sausage brain,
you know that?

06:17.002 --> 06:19.459
You're just a sore loser.

06:21.339 --> 06:24.331
That was him.
Come on, he's getting away.

06:58.585 --> 07:01.952
Remember, in the guts.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.495
He wants his head.

07:03.673 --> 07:08.258
Oh, man. When I hit him with this,
won't be nothing left but the head.

07:29.199 --> 07:32.987
Stay right there.
Get that lettuce cutter out of sight.

07:33.161 --> 07:36.244
Okay. Here we go.

07:48.677 --> 07:50.383
Doesn't Mark his head.

07:53.765 --> 07:55.972
You wouldn't shoot an unarmed man,
would you, old-timer?

07:57.227 --> 07:58.808
Were you back at Copperfield?

07:58.979 --> 08:02.312
Yep, we seen you go by.
Dave Roberts.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.643
Oh, god. You bastard.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.192
Got him dead on, Dave!

08:23.211 --> 08:25.122
I killed his ass, Dave.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.048
Dave?

08:29.467 --> 08:30.957
Dave?

08:38.560 --> 08:41.051
Flagg:
You in a heap of trouble, son.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.853
I told you not to Mark him.

08:55.910 --> 09:00.028
Flagg:
I told you not to Mark him.

09:26.691 --> 09:29.057
All right, all right. Shut the hell up.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.559
This is Lloyd, come on back.

09:31.738 --> 09:34.480
Flagg: The judge is a wash.

09:36.951 --> 09:37.951
What?

09:40.622 --> 09:42.704
A wash. A wash.

09:42.874 --> 09:45.456
A total washout!

09:45.960 --> 09:47.575
Do you copy, you idiot?

09:49.130 --> 09:50.666
Yeah, I copy.

09:51.674 --> 09:54.165
Flagg:
It's time to take their number two.

09:55.762 --> 09:56.842
You know who it is?

09:57.514 --> 10:00.221
I've known all along, actually.

10:08.525 --> 10:10.356
Listen to me, Lloyd.

10:10.902 --> 10:13.985
Listen to me very carefully, soldier.

10:14.155 --> 10:16.237
Lloyd: Wake up.

10:20.870 --> 10:21.870
Come here.

10:22.038 --> 10:25.280
Get dressed, you lying, spying bitch.

10:30.338 --> 10:33.080
Uh-uh. Forget about the bathroom.
Do it here.

10:33.258 --> 10:35.169
Yeah do it here.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.508
Lloyd, you have seen me naked
for the last time

10:37.679 --> 10:39.385
in your short, miserable life.

10:39.556 --> 10:42.013
I'm going in there,
and if you even try and stop me,

10:42.142 --> 10:44.849
I will do my very best
to give you a sex-change operation.

10:45.019 --> 10:46.850
Excuse me.

10:47.021 --> 10:48.306
Let her go. Let her go.

10:48.481 --> 10:51.564
If she tries to lock the door,
break it down.

10:51.734 --> 10:56.273
You do know that I faked it every time,
don't you, Lloyd?

11:03.705 --> 11:05.912
What the hell are you laughing at?

11:12.088 --> 11:15.296
I wasn't over here risking my life

11:15.425 --> 11:19.259
and sleeping with you, Lloyd, for fun.

11:19.762 --> 11:25.223
Do you people know
what your tin god is up to?

11:26.144 --> 11:31.138
What is it that you think that they're
doing out there at Indian Springs?

11:35.528 --> 11:36.528
Lloyd: Hey.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.812
If you're not out of there
in 30 seconds,

11:38.990 --> 11:40.981
you can give your sermon to flagg
in your panties.

11:41.159 --> 11:42.740
Yes

11:52.587 --> 11:55.329
He says "frog," you jump.

11:55.465 --> 11:57.376
Isn't that the way it goes?

11:57.550 --> 12:00.041
He's the biggest
and the strongest, ma'am.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.380
Dayna: You're wrong.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.051
And you're a fool.

12:03.181 --> 12:04.671
Come on.

12:16.027 --> 12:17.392
I've got her, r.F.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.435
R.f. How perfect.

12:19.614 --> 12:21.730
Flagg: Send her in, please.

12:34.796 --> 12:36.457
Dayna.

12:36.631 --> 12:38.337
Hi come in.

12:38.508 --> 12:40.169
Tsk-tsk-tsk.

12:40.301 --> 12:43.634
You expected Charles manson
at the very least, didn't you? Ha-ha-ha.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.629
I don't know what I expected.

12:46.808 --> 12:48.423
Lloyd... Lloyd?

12:49.936 --> 12:54.930
Poor Lloyd had a very bitter experience
in Phoenix not long ago.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.348
It marked him.

12:56.985 --> 12:58.191
Sit down, dayna.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.372
What happened to the chairs?

13:17.505 --> 13:19.496
Oh, I had them taken out.

13:19.924 --> 13:22.586
Liars sit in chairs, you know?

13:23.011 --> 13:26.128
Truth tellers just sort of hunker down.

13:27.849 --> 13:30.340
Your friends in Boulder sent you
to spy out the land. True?

13:30.977 --> 13:31.977
I suppose.

13:32.103 --> 13:35.721
You, the judge and someone else.

13:35.898 --> 13:39.390
I can't quite see this third person.

13:40.737 --> 13:41.943
Sometimes... usually, in fact.

13:42.113 --> 13:44.775
I can figure these things out
for myself.

13:44.949 --> 13:49.158
I'm one of those lucky people
with a little psychic twinkle.

13:49.329 --> 13:53.413
But every time I try to see
this third spy,

13:55.501 --> 13:58.789
all I can see is the moon.

13:59.964 --> 14:04.128
M-o-o-n. That spells moon.

14:10.308 --> 14:11.969
Does that mean anything to you,
dayna?

14:13.811 --> 14:15.597
Not a thing.

14:17.899 --> 14:19.480
What about the judge?

14:19.650 --> 14:21.356
Oh, never mind the judge.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.563
Now, pay attention, dear.

14:25.114 --> 14:27.605
I'm disposed to give you your things

14:27.742 --> 14:29.528
and send you back to your friends
in Boulder.

14:30.036 --> 14:33.449
And when you get back,
I'd simply like you to tell them for me

14:33.623 --> 14:36.581
that we are just trying
to get on our feet again,

14:36.751 --> 14:38.241
as they are.

14:38.419 --> 14:40.375
That we mean them no harm.

14:40.505 --> 14:43.212
Then what's Carl hough
and that weirdo trashcan man

14:43.341 --> 14:45.252
doing out at Indian Springs”?

14:45.385 --> 14:47.505
Are you planning to turn the missiles
stockpiled there

14:47.637 --> 14:49.878
into new age water fountains
or something?

14:51.599 --> 14:54.215
Never mind the trashcan man.

14:54.727 --> 14:58.811
Let it go, dear. There's no reason
to hang on to this spy business.

14:59.649 --> 15:02.857
Your old black witch is dead.
Your people are in confusion.

15:02.985 --> 15:05.397
If there was ever any reason
for your being here, it's gone.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.061
Mother abagail is not dead.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.864
Ohh.

15:11.869 --> 15:14.281
I'm afraid she is.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.157
I don't believe it

15:16.332 --> 15:19.995
she died in a coma
without saying a word.

15:21.587 --> 15:25.330
Well, that's it, dear.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.051
You mean I can just go?

15:38.563 --> 15:40.804
Flagg:
Oh, there is one more thing.

15:42.859 --> 15:44.019
What's that?

15:44.193 --> 15:46.525
The moon man, dear. Who is he?

15:46.696 --> 15:48.357
I don't know.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.026
I think you do.

15:52.201 --> 15:54.066
No, really. I don't know.

15:54.245 --> 15:57.453
I didn't even know about the judge
until I heard Lloyd talking about him

15:57.582 --> 15:59.243
with some guy in Idaho.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.749
That makes perfect sense.

16:02.587 --> 16:04.953
But all the same, you do know.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.502
You know and you will tell me.
Do you understand?

16:08.593 --> 16:12.381
Why don't you know?
Why don't you know already?

16:12.555 --> 16:14.216
I don't know.

16:15.349 --> 16:17.635
Tell me, you bitch! Tell me!

16:18.769 --> 16:19.849
Eat this!

16:27.904 --> 16:29.815
Oh, my dear.

16:38.331 --> 16:41.289
You will tell me what I wanna know.

16:41.375 --> 16:44.458
Before I'm through with you,
you'll beg to tell me.

16:54.805 --> 16:57.296
No!

17:07.068 --> 17:08.808
Bitch.

17:27.004 --> 17:29.791
Stu:
Come back when the moon is full.

17:29.966 --> 17:32.082
Tom: When the moon is full

17:33.594 --> 17:37.883
m-o-o-n. That spells moon.

17:48.609 --> 17:50.600
Watch out, would you?

17:55.616 --> 17:58.278
Hmm the feeb.

19:28.459 --> 19:30.245
Larry: What is it, stu?

19:31.587 --> 19:32.997
It's Harold.

19:34.632 --> 19:36.293
He's dead.

19:38.386 --> 19:42.299
I don't know how I know or why,
but he's dead.

19:43.391 --> 19:45.723
He blew his own head off

19:50.940 --> 19:52.555
Gun oil

19:53.192 --> 19:55.683
my mouth's full of the taste.

19:58.406 --> 20:02.149
May god have mercy
on his poor excuse for a soul.

21:02.636 --> 21:04.843
Boy 1: Hey, trash, what did
old lady semple say

21:04.930 --> 21:06.841
when you torched
her pension check?

21:07.016 --> 21:10.634
Boy 2: People who play with fire
wet the bed, trash. Ha-ha-ha!

21:10.811 --> 21:12.972
I eave me alone.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.346
Shut up about old lady semple.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.515
And leave me alone.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.566
Girl: Ew! Keep him away from me.

21:20.112 --> 21:23.354
They're gonna stick you in the
nuthatch up in terre haute, trash.

21:23.449 --> 21:27.033
Stick you in the nuthatch and give you
a few thousand shock treatments.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.154
No!

21:32.249 --> 21:34.035
Carl: Trash. Hey, trash.

21:34.210 --> 21:36.792
I've been looking for you everywhere.

21:46.889 --> 21:51.383
Damn firebug. I don't trust him.

21:55.606 --> 21:57.517
Wait a minute.

21:57.691 --> 21:59.431
Wait just one damn minute.

22:00.778 --> 22:01.778
Oh, my god. No.

22:09.537 --> 22:11.277
I eave me alone!

22:17.086 --> 22:18.542
I couldn't help it!

22:19.213 --> 22:24.253
I couldn't help it. I'm so sorry!

22:25.761 --> 22:30.300
I'm so sorry!

22:43.654 --> 22:48.614
Nadine needs a ride.

23:02.256 --> 23:07.216
Nadine needs a ride.

23:10.639 --> 23:12.470
Flagg: Nadine.

23:14.810 --> 23:16.516
Over here.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.891
Over here, my love.

23:26.989 --> 23:29.731
That's right. This way.

23:55.601 --> 23:57.307
Randall

23:58.896 --> 24:00.602
is that you?

24:47.778 --> 24:50.611
I waited so long.

24:50.739 --> 24:53.025
The waiting's over.

25:38.287 --> 25:39.993
No

25:40.706 --> 25:41.912
No

25:42.124 --> 25:44.035
No

25:46.420 --> 25:48.536
No no.

25:48.714 --> 25:51.751
Oh, it's too late to say no, dear.

25:52.968 --> 25:54.754
Much too late.

25:54.970 --> 25:57.086
No no.

25:57.222 --> 25:59.178
No!

26:07.399 --> 26:12.439
Nadine: Oh, god! No!

26:17.576 --> 26:18.986
Didn't come to make a fuss

26:19.161 --> 26:20.571
or pick a fight

26:20.746 --> 26:24.830
just want you to tell me
if you think you can

26:25.000 --> 26:31.417
baby, can you dig your man?

26:31.590 --> 26:33.455
He's a righteous man

26:38.430 --> 26:41.763
I'll bet you haven't been in this good
a shape since you was a kid.

26:41.934 --> 26:43.925
Larry:
About a hundred years ago, right?

26:44.061 --> 26:45.471
Come on.

26:45.646 --> 26:49.059
There's a perfectly good reason
for this little stroll, you know.

26:49.233 --> 26:52.225
And mother abagail knew it
when she sent us out the way she did,

26:52.402 --> 26:54.518
with just the clothes on our backs.

26:54.696 --> 26:56.152
Our bellies are empty.

26:56.323 --> 26:58.939
And more importantly,
our heads are empty.

26:59.118 --> 27:02.406
Hell, mine was pretty empty
to begin with.

27:02.788 --> 27:04.153
Yeah, well, I'm serious.

27:04.331 --> 27:06.743
We're out here in the middle
of the great American nowhere,

27:06.917 --> 27:10.250
minus all the baggage we used to carry
everyplace we went.

27:10.379 --> 27:13.997
She wanted us cleaned out, empty,

27:14.174 --> 27:17.166
ready to be filled up again
by some new thing.

27:17.302 --> 27:19.509
Maybe a great thing.

27:19.680 --> 27:22.843
And almost certainly the last thing.

27:28.272 --> 27:30.763
Stu: Come on, Kojak. Fetch, boy.

27:30.899 --> 27:33.606
Go on, go get it. Go.

27:44.955 --> 27:46.820
Welcome to Las Vegas, ma'am.

28:04.808 --> 28:06.344
So if the feeb's important,

28:06.518 --> 28:09.760
you make sure that he knows
it was me who told you, okay?

28:09.938 --> 28:12.725
- Yeah, I got it. Don't worry. All right.
- Me, me, me.

28:12.858 --> 28:14.064
Lloyd? Re

28:14.234 --> 28:16.850
- good to see you.
- Thought we might see you last night.

28:16.945 --> 28:20.403
Oh, well.
You know how it is with newlyweds.

28:20.574 --> 28:22.574
Lloyd: Listen, we haven't managed
to pick trash up.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.487
We're concentrating
west of Indian Springs,

28:24.620 --> 28:26.485
but it's a big country.
It might take a while.

28:26.622 --> 28:28.237
He'll come back in
on his own eventually.

28:28.415 --> 28:32.374
When he does,
I want him put away, but mercifully.

28:34.630 --> 28:35.870
I doubt you can understand,

28:36.048 --> 28:41.213
but I felt a certain kinship
for that boy.

28:41.386 --> 28:42.751
I don't want him to suffer.

28:42.888 --> 28:44.424
Lloyd: Fine.

28:45.933 --> 28:47.844
- I just thought...
Julie: Tell him.

28:48.936 --> 28:50.301
Ooh.

28:51.730 --> 28:54.267
Such a rude child.

29:03.867 --> 29:04.982
Come, dear.

29:05.077 --> 29:07.534
This might be important.
This girl thinks she saw something.

29:07.663 --> 29:09.619
Later, later, later.
Come up this afternoon.

29:09.790 --> 29:11.997
One o'clock should be fine.

29:12.167 --> 29:13.828
In the meantime.

29:15.045 --> 29:17.252
She's crazy about me, Lloyd.

29:17.381 --> 29:19.246
She can't get enough.

29:20.550 --> 29:22.165
Wave bye-bye.

29:22.803 --> 29:25.636
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

29:27.349 --> 29:29.510
We are dead,

29:29.685 --> 29:35.305
and this is hell

29:35.857 --> 29:38.269
unh! You promised me
you were gonna tell him.

29:38.443 --> 29:41.480
Shut up. Shut the hell up.

29:41.655 --> 29:44.772
Baby, can you dig your man?

29:45.993 --> 29:47.574
He's a righteous man

29:48.578 --> 29:52.412
tell me, baby
can you dig your man?

29:55.168 --> 29:57.534
Can you get that, sweetie pie?

29:59.172 --> 30:01.037
Ooh. Guess not.

30:10.517 --> 30:13.008
Lloyd. Come in.

30:13.228 --> 30:15.093
Come in, come in, come in.

30:19.943 --> 30:23.106
I don't believe I've introduced
my wife to you by name.

30:23.280 --> 30:24.736
Lloyd: No.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.275
Flagg: Nadine.

30:31.621 --> 30:35.409
I'd like you to meet Lloyd henreid,
my number-one soldier.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.206
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

30:37.377 --> 30:39.834
Oh, no, no, no. Shake hands, kids.

30:42.341 --> 30:44.047
Shake it, Nadine.

30:45.969 --> 30:48.005
That's nice.

30:49.389 --> 30:51.755
You can put it down now, my love.

30:56.063 --> 30:58.520
My wife is indisposed.

30:58.690 --> 31:01.432
She also has a bun in the old oven.

31:01.651 --> 31:03.733
Perhaps the two are related.

31:04.112 --> 31:05.773
Care to gargle a little firewater, Lloyd?

31:06.615 --> 31:10.028
A libation to little Randy Jr.

31:11.620 --> 31:13.611
Yeah. I'll have a gin and tonic.

31:14.247 --> 31:15.987
The drink of champions. Make it two.

31:17.292 --> 31:19.032
You can sit down now, my love.

31:26.009 --> 31:28.091
I'm sorry, my dear.

31:28.220 --> 31:32.133
The surgeon general says
that pregnant women shouldn't drink.

31:32.766 --> 31:35.178
Or did before he died of the flu,
right, Lloyd?

31:43.485 --> 31:46.192
There are four men on their way here
from Boulder.

31:47.697 --> 31:49.733
Strolling right up route 73
for some mad reason

31:49.908 --> 31:52.024
known only to themselves
and their dead witch.

31:52.869 --> 31:55.611
I want them bagged
and I want them brought here.

31:56.415 --> 31:57.530
Send out Barry dorgan.

31:59.292 --> 32:00.748
A dozen good men.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.455
You want me to have
some crosses made?

32:04.840 --> 32:09.083
Flagg: I think something slightly
more inventive may be in order here.

32:11.638 --> 32:14.050
Natives seem restless, you know.

32:15.058 --> 32:19.301
What about that skinny little
bat-faced girl downstairs?

32:19.729 --> 32:21.014
What's her itch?

32:21.189 --> 32:24.056
Well, she thinks she spotted
their third spy night before last.

32:24.234 --> 32:25.565
Says she saw him in Kansas

32:25.777 --> 32:29.110
in the company
of a young deaf-mute male.

32:29.281 --> 32:32.523
I don't know, but this deaf-mute
sure sounds like the one on their...

32:41.084 --> 32:42.665
Lloyd: What?

32:43.920 --> 32:44.920
Come here. Lloyd: What?

32:45.088 --> 32:46.088
Come here. “What?

32:46.256 --> 32:48.042
What did I do?

32:49.676 --> 32:51.758
Flagg: And you let me go upstairs
without telling me?

32:51.970 --> 32:55.428
I could pop your neck like a tick.
Maybe I should.

32:55.599 --> 32:57.806
I tried to tell you. You cut me off.

33:11.698 --> 33:13.154
I hate this.

33:15.577 --> 33:16.908
What in the...?

33:41.978 --> 33:43.013
How's that drink, Lloyd?

33:43.772 --> 33:46.388
Oh, it's great. It's all over the wall.

33:55.992 --> 33:58.278
I gotta tell you something, Lloyd.

33:59.037 --> 34:01.528
For a guy who almost turned his
cellmate into canapés,

34:01.706 --> 34:04.072
you got a yard of guts,
you know that?

34:04.251 --> 34:05.866
Thank you.

34:06.044 --> 34:07.875
Doesn't he, Nadine?

34:08.797 --> 34:10.503
She says yes.

34:17.514 --> 34:21.382
This guy the girl with the big hair
thinks she saw

34:25.689 --> 34:26.769
what's his name?

34:32.696 --> 34:34.311
Tom Cullen.

34:35.115 --> 34:37.697
Probably doesn't matter much. Still...

34:41.246 --> 34:42.246
Send out a hundred men.

34:43.290 --> 34:45.281
Put Russ dorr in charge.

34:45.417 --> 34:48.284
Maybe they'll get lucky
and stumble across him.

34:48.670 --> 34:51.252
What about trash”? What do you
want me to do about him?

35:04.269 --> 35:06.055
Just remember,

35:07.397 --> 35:10.935
when he comes in,
it's to be quick and painless.

35:13.069 --> 35:16.653
Listen, r.F., is everything all right?

35:17.365 --> 35:18.821
Fine as fiddlesticks.
Why do you ask?

35:18.992 --> 35:20.573
Well, I just...

35:22.120 --> 35:25.533
Some of the folks
are 3 little bit worried.

35:25.707 --> 35:28.369
I'm a little bit worried myself,
tell you the truth.

35:28.543 --> 35:30.124
That's all

35:31.338 --> 35:33.624
everything's fine, Lloyd.

35:35.050 --> 35:36.881
Everything will continue to be fine

35:37.052 --> 35:40.044
as long as you remember
who's the boss

35:42.098 --> 35:44.339
and who's got the power.

35:44.517 --> 35:45.973
Right?

35:47.520 --> 35:48.930
Right.

36:05.330 --> 36:07.742
Nadine:
They're coming for you, you know.

36:07.916 --> 36:10.658
The old woman sent them
before she died.

36:12.170 --> 36:15.378
Get your ass back in here.

36:19.511 --> 36:25.256
Nadine: Everything you've made here
is falling apart.

36:25.475 --> 36:30.845
They're saying a simple retarded boy
outwitted Randall flagg.

36:31.022 --> 36:34.560
They're saying judge farris
got away from your man in Idaho.

36:35.360 --> 36:38.227
He's as dead as Judas iscariot.

36:38.697 --> 36:42.235
They're asking questions
about dayna too.

36:42.909 --> 36:47.528
It's all slipping through your fingers.

36:48.581 --> 36:51.539
And they're whispering, Randy.

36:53.837 --> 36:58.046
I can see them leaving their posts
in the dead of night

36:58.216 --> 37:01.333
and your eye can't see that.

37:03.430 --> 37:06.513
And when they come here,

37:07.100 --> 37:08.806
stu

37:09.477 --> 37:11.308
and Ralph

37:11.479 --> 37:12.889
and Glen

37:13.064 --> 37:14.975
and la...

37:17.652 --> 37:22.112
When they get here,
your time will end.

37:22.282 --> 37:23.772
And I'll be watching.

37:23.950 --> 37:27.363
I'll be watching from hell
with your baby in my arms.

37:32.917 --> 37:34.407
Flagg: Come back in, Nadine.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.622
I'll give you everything
you could ever want.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.623
Can you give me Larry again?

37:44.971 --> 37:47.804
Your seed is cold.

37:48.558 --> 37:50.219
You liar.

37:52.353 --> 37:55.971
Flagg: No!

38:02.030 --> 38:03.986
It doesn't matter.

38:06.993 --> 38:09.109
No backing out now.

38:14.209 --> 38:16.700
I'm staying right here.

38:18.254 --> 38:20.415
Do you hear me?

38:22.467 --> 38:23.923
Right here.

38:43.404 --> 38:45.315
The fire.

38:45.698 --> 38:49.691
The big fire.

39:01.714 --> 39:03.045
Whoo.

39:04.342 --> 39:08.927
Bumpty, bumpty, bump.

39:10.682 --> 39:13.549
If you love me, you'll give me a bump

39:13.726 --> 39:16.593
a great big, big bumpty bump

39:16.813 --> 39:19.680
call me a Christian
or call me a Jew

39:19.858 --> 39:24.852
my life for you! My life for you!

39:40.044 --> 39:42.285
So why'd you get me out here, whit?

39:43.590 --> 39:44.921
Whitney: Uh

39:46.426 --> 39:48.667
Lloyd: Walls have ears, huh?

39:50.013 --> 39:51.469
So”?

39:52.056 --> 39:54.889
Me and some of the others
are cutting loose.

39:55.351 --> 39:56.887
Man, I must be crazy telling you this.

39:57.020 --> 39:58.510
It's all right.

39:59.814 --> 40:01.270
Cut loose where?

40:01.900 --> 40:05.563
South America. Near rio.

40:06.404 --> 40:09.066
Jenny's been there
and she says it's nice.

40:09.574 --> 40:13.658
Fresh water, fresh fruit, ocean air.

40:14.203 --> 40:16.865
And just plain folks.

40:17.081 --> 40:22.451
Ones who wanna forget they ever
hooked up with his infernal majesty.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.378
So, what do you say?

40:26.549 --> 40:28.289
Me? I'm sticking.

40:28.468 --> 40:29.468
Why?

40:30.136 --> 40:31.967
It's going bad here. Can't you feel it?

40:32.096 --> 40:35.008
Maybe. But he saved me
from starving to death.

40:35.183 --> 40:37.640
And that's not even the main thing.
I mean...

40:38.895 --> 40:41.181
He changed me, you know?

40:41.814 --> 40:42.814
And he trusted me.

40:43.816 --> 40:45.807
So, yeah, I'm sticking.

40:48.237 --> 40:50.102
Man, you're nuts.

40:51.115 --> 40:52.571
You're probably right.

41:00.416 --> 41:03.249
You know,
I thought there'd be whores.

41:03.378 --> 41:05.209
I haven't seen any whores.

41:05.338 --> 41:07.624
The man don't even
want you to have a drink.

41:07.799 --> 41:10.006
And dope? Pfft. Forget about it.

41:11.844 --> 41:13.755
I've been thinking,

41:14.222 --> 41:16.554
I might not go back to Vegas at all.

41:17.308 --> 41:19.845
Mexico ain't but 300 miles
in that direction.

41:24.816 --> 41:25.976
What was that?

41:26.150 --> 41:28.391
Just a deer. They're all over.

41:28.569 --> 41:30.525
Maybe we should go look.

41:30.697 --> 41:32.437
(50 ahead.

41:33.616 --> 41:36.699
Why should I be out there
wandering around in the dark,

41:36.869 --> 41:40.453
maybe break my leg
for that freak in cowboy boots?

41:40.623 --> 41:42.033
You ought to watch it, rich.

41:42.208 --> 41:45.416
Man has a way of hearing things,
seeing things.

41:45.628 --> 41:47.960
Flagg don't scare me.

41:49.090 --> 41:50.580
Billy, toss me another one.

41:50.758 --> 41:52.919
I gotta sit out here
and freeze my butt off.

41:53.094 --> 41:57.804
M-o-o-n. That spells moon.

42:49.817 --> 42:51.899
Ralph: Oh, man.

42:52.487 --> 42:55.820
Someone ought to call the Utah state
highway department about this.

42:55.907 --> 42:59.525
Must've been a flash flood.
A damn mess.

42:59.702 --> 43:01.488
Stu:
Think you can make it, Glen?

43:01.662 --> 43:04.199
I think so.
Now, what do you think, Kojak?

43:08.127 --> 43:11.369
Ralph: Whoa! Hey, hey! Whoo!

43:12.632 --> 43:14.998
Glen: Won't any of us
do better than that, huh?

43:15.176 --> 43:16.962
Well, here goes.

43:23.142 --> 43:24.302
Ralph: Whoo! Stu: Whoa!

43:24.477 --> 43:26.513
Larry: All right. Stu: Yeah, go.

43:29.816 --> 43:31.272
Larry: Go for it, professor.

43:32.110 --> 43:33.691
(So for it.

43:33.861 --> 43:36.443
Shoot that curl

43:38.241 --> 43:40.027
Ralph: All right.

43:40.910 --> 43:42.821
Come on, guys. Come on.

43:52.839 --> 43:55.501
Larry: Whoo! Whoa!

43:56.384 --> 43:58.045
Whoo!

44:00.179 --> 44:01.464
\whoal

44:03.474 --> 44:05.010
look out, boy.

44:08.855 --> 44:10.891
Glen: Come on, St...

44:14.819 --> 44:16.229
Piece of cake.

44:16.445 --> 44:19.653
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe we were just lucky.

44:19.824 --> 44:21.610
It felt to me like
if you put one foot wrong,

44:21.784 --> 44:23.069
the whole embankment would go.

44:23.244 --> 44:26.156
Yep. And this side's not any better.

44:30.376 --> 44:32.583
Okay. So who's first now?

44:33.462 --> 44:34.998
I'll go.

44:35.506 --> 44:38.043
You guys wait till I'm all the way up.

44:39.093 --> 44:40.879
Be careful.

44:41.053 --> 44:42.759
Piece of cake.

44:57.403 --> 45:00.236
- There he goes.
Ralph: He's all right. He's all right.

45:25.014 --> 45:26.345
Stu: You see?

45:26.974 --> 45:29.306
I told you, piece of cake.

45:29.518 --> 45:30.678
Stu. Larry: Oh, my god.

45:35.149 --> 45:38.687
Stu: Oh! Aah. Aah!

45:39.487 --> 45:40.943
Easy. Go easy. Easy.

45:42.615 --> 45:44.606
Oh, it's not my head. It's my...

45:46.661 --> 45:48.902
- Just don't move. Don't move.
- My leg.

45:50.498 --> 45:51.533
Larry: Don't move.

45:52.208 --> 45:54.995
Stu: Aah!
Ll arry: Just don't move.

46:06.347 --> 46:08.303
I'm okay. Go ahead.

46:11.352 --> 46:13.718
Ralph: There. It's done.

46:21.153 --> 46:22.233
Hey, hey, hey.

46:22.405 --> 46:24.316
That's a good way to kill yourself,
Bateman.

46:27.910 --> 46:29.901
Where'd you get the soda?
Tour bus.

46:30.079 --> 46:31.615
About a quarter of a mile
west of here.

46:31.789 --> 46:34.781
- Thanks.
- They had beer too.

46:35.001 --> 46:37.538
But I didn't want you taking these
with alcohol.

46:37.753 --> 46:40.415
I brought them with me
for my arthritis.

46:41.007 --> 46:42.007
Down the hatch.

46:43.384 --> 46:45.500
Ralph and I'll go next time, Glen.

46:45.678 --> 46:47.168
Stay here with stu and rest up.

46:47.346 --> 46:48.802
(0 where?

46:48.973 --> 46:50.573
We gotta make you
some kind of stretcher.

46:50.725 --> 46:52.215
Get you out of here.

46:52.393 --> 46:54.634
Hole up someplace.
I think green river would be best.

46:54.812 --> 46:56.552
No, Larry.

46:58.190 --> 46:59.851
I'm not going.

47:00.192 --> 47:01.932
What are you talking about?

47:02.111 --> 47:03.692
I'm saying no.

47:03.863 --> 47:05.854
No trip to green river. No stretcher.

47:07.700 --> 47:09.531
This is no game, St...

47:09.660 --> 47:11.116
Glen: Stu's right, Larry.

47:11.871 --> 47:14.453
Mother abagail said
one of us would fall by the way.

47:14.623 --> 47:17.114
What does that mean, huh?

47:17.293 --> 47:18.533
What are you saying?

47:18.711 --> 47:22.124
You're a college professor,
for god's sakes.

47:22.465 --> 47:23.625
Not anymore.

47:23.799 --> 47:25.719
In case you hadn't noticed, Larry,
school is out.

47:25.843 --> 47:28.380
Look, I thought he was your friend.

47:28.929 --> 47:30.715
Of course he's my friend.

47:32.641 --> 47:34.552
But that doesn't matter now.

47:34.769 --> 47:36.384
- It's god's plan.
- Shut up about god.

47:36.562 --> 47:38.098
I'm sick of hearing about god.

47:38.230 --> 47:40.391
This whole trip
was based on the idea

47:40.566 --> 47:42.727
that mother abagall
knew what she was talking about.

47:42.902 --> 47:44.608
- That's right.
- It's not right.

47:44.737 --> 47:46.853
It's not right.

47:47.031 --> 47:49.647
This isn't god's will or god's plan.

47:50.451 --> 47:51.657
It's a washout.

47:51.869 --> 47:54.451
And you got a broken leg, stu,
and I'm not gonna leave you here.

47:54.622 --> 47:55.702
Larry, Larry, listen.

47:56.082 --> 47:57.788
What? “Listen

47:58.084 --> 48:00.040
- I'm not gonna leave...
- Listen.

48:01.504 --> 48:02.710
When we came on this trip,

48:02.880 --> 48:05.667
we put our lives in the hands
of mother abagail's god.

48:05.841 --> 48:07.672
Now, that hasn't changed.

48:08.386 --> 48:11.970
If he wants me to eat,
he'll send food.

48:12.098 --> 48:14.589
If he wants me to drink,

48:16.102 --> 48:18.058
he'll send rain.

48:19.855 --> 48:21.220
It's his business

48:21.399 --> 48:24.857
yours is to go against flagg.

48:25.027 --> 48:28.064
Now, you got to do that.
You got to go without me.

48:28.572 --> 48:30.278
Man.

48:33.160 --> 48:34.741
Man,

48:35.329 --> 48:38.492
do you know how crazy that sounds?

48:40.918 --> 48:44.251
Do you know how totally damn crazy
that sounds?

48:44.422 --> 48:46.253
Come on.

49:11.782 --> 49:13.318
Thanks.

49:14.535 --> 49:18.027
More than three or four
would probably be fatal.

49:18.873 --> 49:20.579
Do you know that?

49:23.502 --> 49:25.788
Yeah, I suppose so.

49:28.132 --> 49:29.963
Goodbye, St...

49:30.926 --> 49:33.042
It's been good knowing you.

49:34.263 --> 49:37.426
If we ever get back this way...
Yeah

49:40.895 --> 49:42.681
if you do.

49:44.064 --> 49:49.809
In the meantime,
let's just leave it at "so long," okay?

50:19.141 --> 50:20.927
Kojak. Come on, boy.

50:21.769 --> 50:23.475
(Go on, boy.

50:25.147 --> 50:27.354
Better come back and get him.

50:27.942 --> 50:32.276
Mother also used to say,
"all things serve the will of god."

50:33.030 --> 50:36.272
Maybe that goes
for big, dumb dogs too.

50:36.534 --> 50:38.274
Take good care of him, east Texas.

52:06.415 --> 52:08.246
Stu: Good dog, Kojak.

52:09.752 --> 52:11.492
That's a good boy.

52:16.342 --> 52:17.878
What, you want this?

52:18.052 --> 52:20.794
I guess it's about that time, isn't it?

52:32.441 --> 52:33.806
I'm getting worse, boy.

52:36.320 --> 52:39.938
It looks like I'm gonna die of the flu
after all, huh?

52:45.329 --> 52:48.241
That's pretty funny
when you think about it.

53:00.844 --> 53:02.334
Here, boy.

53:05.099 --> 53:07.966
You go on. I lost my appetite.

53:09.103 --> 53:10.639
(0 on.

53:23.575 --> 53:25.782
I miss you, frannie.

53:27.246 --> 53:28.486
I miss you.

53:45.848 --> 53:48.885
So here it is

54:02.448 --> 54:04.564
I will fear no evil

54:05.743 --> 54:07.279
I will fear no evil

54:14.960 --> 54:17.076
Yo, yo, let's go!

54:23.135 --> 54:26.969
Hold your fire.
Flagg wants them taken alive.

54:39.318 --> 54:41.525
Halt, right where you are.

54:41.653 --> 54:43.609
Burlson: Halt, he said.

54:48.619 --> 54:49.619
How you doing?

54:52.873 --> 54:54.613
Where's Stuart redman?

54:54.833 --> 54:58.041
He met with a slight accident
on the way here, Mr...?

54:58.253 --> 55:00.209
He's Paul burlson, my first deputy.

55:00.339 --> 55:02.500
I'm Barry dorgan,
chief of Vegas security.

55:02.674 --> 55:04.790
- What kind of an accident?
- He stubbed his toe.

55:04.968 --> 55:08.460
Look, Mr. drogan,
chief dragon, captain droogan,

55:08.555 --> 55:11.275
whatever you wanna call yourself,
why don't we just get on with this?

55:11.433 --> 55:14.300
All right. By virtue of the power
vested in me, smart-ass,

55:14.478 --> 55:15.478
you're under arrest.

55:15.646 --> 55:18.479
- In whose name?
- You know who I speak for.

55:18.649 --> 55:20.685
Ralph:
Then why don't you say it?

55:23.695 --> 55:25.686
Well, I'll say it for you.

55:25.906 --> 55:28.067
Calls himself Randall flagg,

55:28.242 --> 55:31.109
but who he really is,
is an apostate of hell.

55:31.286 --> 55:34.369
Now, you got that on your
little clipboard there, Mr. burlson?

55:34.498 --> 55:38.082
I wonder if you men might give me
your social-security numbers?

55:43.924 --> 55:45.835
All right. I want them split up.

55:46.009 --> 55:49.251
Take laughing boy and the old man
and put them in the back of my car.

55:49.429 --> 55:52.262
Take, uh, farmer John,
put him in the back of yours, Ace.

55:52.391 --> 55:53.847
Yo

55:53.976 --> 55:55.841
Larry: Come on. Come on.

55:56.228 --> 55:57.228
Relax.

55:59.064 --> 56:01.931
You don't need those.
That's why we came here.

56:04.444 --> 56:06.480
We got a message
for your little tin god.

56:06.780 --> 56:08.566
Tin god?

56:09.408 --> 56:11.114
Tin god.

56:11.535 --> 56:12.991
Man, that's funny.

56:13.161 --> 56:16.198
I spent 22 years
on the Santa Monica p.D.,

56:16.665 --> 56:19.998
and I know what happens when
guys like you end up running the show.

56:20.085 --> 56:23.248
We haven't got a single addict
in Vegas.

56:23.463 --> 56:25.374
Can your people say the same?

56:25.549 --> 56:30.043
Mr. dorgan, even a man
of your apparently limited intelligence

56:30.178 --> 56:32.339
should be able to see
that your experiences

56:32.431 --> 56:34.763
with a few battered babies
and drug abusers

56:34.933 --> 56:38.141
doesn't justify your embrace
of a monster.

56:40.147 --> 56:42.183
Larry:
Oh, that's great. Very good.

56:42.357 --> 56:46.145
You get the Rodney king humanitarian
award for the day, pal... aah!

56:47.362 --> 56:49.193
Glen:
It's almost over for them now, Larry.

56:50.282 --> 56:51.397
Can you feel it?

56:51.742 --> 56:54.449
Yeah I can feel it

56:54.578 --> 56:57.320
all right, never mind the cuffs.
Just get them in the cars. Now.

56:57.539 --> 56:59.154
Now move!

57:13.680 --> 57:16.171
Glen: You're quite a piece of work,
Mr. cockroach.

57:17.059 --> 57:19.641
We could take a lesson from you.

57:20.187 --> 57:22.348
Especially in light of recent events.

57:23.774 --> 57:30.316
I have an idea that I'll be gone
come this time tomorrow,

57:31.448 --> 57:34.815
but you'll still be trucking, won't you?

57:35.202 --> 57:37.864
Running your little roach errands.

57:42.751 --> 57:45.208
It's a wrap on the roach.

57:53.261 --> 57:54.922
Randall flagg.

57:56.682 --> 58:00.391
And not half the bogeyman
we expected.

58:02.020 --> 58:06.354
I'd like you to meet my associate,
Mr. Lloyd henreid.

58:06.525 --> 58:09.608
Lloyd, meet Mr. Glen Bateman.

58:09.736 --> 58:11.192
Pleased to meet you.

58:11.363 --> 58:12.569
How's that arthritis, Glen?

58:13.281 --> 58:15.237
May I call you Glen?

58:15.450 --> 58:16.940
It looks painful.

58:21.039 --> 58:23.200
I could fix that.
Would you like me to?

58:23.333 --> 58:27.042
No more swollen, screaming joints
for the rest of your life.

58:27.212 --> 58:28.873
All you have to do is ask.

58:29.047 --> 58:30.457
Glen: What a deal

58:30.632 --> 58:32.338
flagg: Just ask.

58:32.509 --> 58:35.342
Ask me to relieve your pain.

58:45.731 --> 58:48.188
It's not so bad, really.

58:49.192 --> 58:52.150
And as for the rest of my life,
how long might that be, anyway?

58:52.279 --> 58:54.565
Six hours? Twelve?

58:55.574 --> 58:58.816
Actually, uh, I've decided to let you go.

59:00.454 --> 59:02.035
Really?

59:03.832 --> 59:05.493
Marvelous.

59:06.626 --> 59:08.912
Of course,
I couldn't go without my friends.

59:09.337 --> 59:12.044
Oh, of course not.
No, you'll all go together.

59:12.174 --> 59:15.086
Tomorrow morning.
Tonight, if you prefer.

59:15.260 --> 59:19.879
And once again,
all you have to do is ask.

59:20.474 --> 59:24.934
Only, for a favor of this magnitude,

59:25.604 --> 59:29.062
I really think
you ought to do it on your knees.

59:39.743 --> 59:41.483
Stop it.

59:42.704 --> 59:43.784
Stop laughing at me.

59:43.955 --> 59:47.447
Sorry, it's just that...
It's just that we made such...

59:47.626 --> 59:49.457
Such a business of you

59:49.628 --> 59:52.711
and it turns out you're nothing more
than another cockroach,

59:52.881 --> 59:54.542
scurrying around,

59:54.716 --> 59:57.549
running little roach errands.

1:00:01.306 --> 1:00:02.921
Shoot him.

1:00:04.559 --> 1:00:07.266
What? You heard me.

1:00:11.566 --> 1:00:13.648
Shoot him, you idiot! Shoot him!

1:00:14.361 --> 1:00:15.851
He's an old man.

1:00:18.281 --> 1:00:22.024
Can't you do anything right?
He's standing right in front of you.

1:00:22.202 --> 1:00:24.488
If you really feel you must
shoot somebody, Mr. henreid,

1:00:24.663 --> 1:00:25.948
I suggest flagg.

1:00:26.373 --> 1:00:28.739
His world is crumbling
and we both know it.

1:00:28.917 --> 1:00:33.456
I think we also both know he can do
a lot of damage on his way down.

1:00:33.630 --> 1:00:35.916
You could change that.

1:00:36.383 --> 1:00:38.499
Well, shoot one of us, anyway.

1:00:38.927 --> 1:00:41.964
I'm the one who got you out of jail
when you were starving.

1:00:42.222 --> 1:00:43.553
Guys like him put you in,

1:00:43.765 --> 1:00:46.222
let the superflu loose
in the first place, for that matter.

1:00:46.560 --> 1:00:48.266
But you choose, Lloyd.

1:00:48.436 --> 1:00:50.051
Glen: He lies, Mr. henreid.

1:00:50.939 --> 1:00:52.895
You know that, don't you?

1:00:54.943 --> 1:00:57.605
Mister, he told me more truth

1:00:57.779 --> 1:01:00.361
than anyone else
in my whole lousy life.

1:01:14.212 --> 1:01:16.828
It's all right, Mr. henreid.

1:01:18.383 --> 1:01:20.089
You don't know any better.

1:01:20.260 --> 1:01:22.626
Shut up, you mouthy old bastard!

1:01:36.693 --> 1:01:39.105
Ralph: Think they just...” yeah

1:01:39.654 --> 1:01:41.565
yeah, I do.

1:01:47.871 --> 1:01:52.285
Our father who art in heaven,

1:01:52.834 --> 1:01:55.075
- hallowed be thy name.
- Hallowed be thy name.

1:01:56.129 --> 1:01:58.040
- Thy kingdom come,
- Thy kingdom come,

1:01:58.298 --> 1:02:00.914
- thy will be done, on earth...
- Thy will be done, on earth...

1:02:15.815 --> 1:02:21.811
Behold a pale horse,
and him who rode upon it was death.

1:02:21.988 --> 1:02:24.695
You must see what's coming, Stuart.

1:02:24.866 --> 1:02:30.702
And take back such news
as will never be forgotten.

1:02:31.164 --> 1:02:32.244
Now wake up.

1:02:32.958 --> 1:02:33.958
Abagail: Wake up.

1:02:35.252 --> 1:02:38.039
I can't. I can't, mother.

1:02:38.672 --> 1:02:40.208
I can't, mother.

1:02:40.382 --> 1:02:42.418
Abagail: Wake up! - I can't I...

1:02:51.268 --> 1:02:53.475
I got to get up there.

1:02:53.645 --> 1:02:55.226
I got...

1:02:56.022 --> 1:02:57.808
I got to get up there.

1:02:59.693 --> 1:03:01.524
I got to get...

1:03:52.620 --> 1:03:54.030
Tom: Stu.

1:03:54.664 --> 1:03:56.780
Take my hand.

1:04:00.920 --> 1:04:03.457
Take hold of my hand.

1:04:14.184 --> 1:04:17.221
Aah! Ow. My leg.

1:04:21.566 --> 1:04:23.477
Hi, St...

1:04:26.112 --> 1:04:27.352
Tommy.

1:04:28.656 --> 1:04:30.237
Why...?

1:04:30.575 --> 1:04:32.111
How... 7

1:04:32.327 --> 1:04:33.692
I was way east of here

1:04:34.287 --> 1:04:36.869
and Nick told me
I had to double back:

1:04:37.040 --> 1:04:39.281
He can talk in my dreams, St...

1:04:39.417 --> 1:04:40.782
Isn't that the limit?

1:04:43.171 --> 1:04:45.207
Yeah, Tommy.

1:04:45.382 --> 1:04:47.338
Yeah, that's the limit.

1:04:50.345 --> 1:04:51.551
Tom: Are you sick?

1:04:51.721 --> 1:04:54.884
Boy, you sound sick. Laws, yes.

1:04:56.267 --> 1:04:58.804
It's the flu, Tommy. Heh-heh.

1:05:00.188 --> 1:05:01.724
Ain't that a bitch?

1:05:01.898 --> 1:05:03.684
I gotta get you inside somewhere.

1:05:03.817 --> 1:05:05.682
No, not yet.

1:05:06.152 --> 1:05:07.312
Why not, stu?

1:05:09.406 --> 1:05:11.192
I don't know.

1:05:12.826 --> 1:05:16.990
But I think
we're gonna find out soon though.

1:05:18.415 --> 1:05:20.246
Okay. We'll just wait.

1:05:20.375 --> 1:05:22.240
We'll just wait here.

1:05:40.145 --> 1:05:42.181
So why did you have to kill Glen?

1:05:42.814 --> 1:05:44.475
He tried to escape.

1:05:47.485 --> 1:05:49.976
You know, one of these days

1:05:50.155 --> 1:05:53.488
you're gonna get shot
trying to escape, dorgan.

1:05:53.825 --> 1:05:55.110
You too, ratty.

1:05:55.326 --> 1:05:56.361
Yep.

1:05:56.494 --> 1:05:58.735
One less rat-man in the world.

1:05:58.830 --> 1:06:00.821
Shut up that honky voodoo.

1:06:01.958 --> 1:06:03.664
Don't be an ass!

1:06:05.920 --> 1:06:08.081
- What's that?
Rat-man: You're gonna see.

1:06:08.256 --> 1:06:10.713
Soon enough.

1:06:38.870 --> 1:06:44.991
Crowd: Killl killl kill

1:06:45.543 --> 1:06:46.874
man 1: Get off

1:06:51.674 --> 1:06:53.460
man 2:
Come on. Move out of the way.

1:06:56.846 --> 1:07:00.054
Dorr: Come out.
Rat-man: Get down, gray meat.

1:07:03.436 --> 1:07:05.347
Disco's dead.

1:07:06.648 --> 1:07:07.928
Dorr: Kill them. Kill them both.

1:07:08.107 --> 1:07:09.467
Burlson:
Man, you better stop them.

1:07:09.692 --> 1:07:10.522
Only flagg can do that.

1:07:10.652 --> 1:07:12.859
Unless he shows,
they'll take them if they want.

1:07:13.029 --> 1:07:14.309
Rat-man: Here you go, gray meat.

1:07:14.489 --> 1:07:17.151
Play us a little traveling music.
Because where you going,

1:07:17.325 --> 1:07:20.738
you gonna be chattel,
and I guarantee.

1:07:22.413 --> 1:07:23.448
Barry: Keep back.

1:07:23.623 --> 1:07:25.033
Burlson:
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1:07:25.208 --> 1:07:27.008
Barry: Keep back.
Burlson: Get out of the way.

1:07:27.168 --> 1:07:30.581
If they move in any closer,
blow a few heads off

1:07:34.717 --> 1:07:37.333
hey, ain't you famous?

1:07:37.804 --> 1:07:40.170
Now I'm famous too.

1:07:45.937 --> 1:07:47.518
Larry: Hold on.
Ralph: I'm trying.

1:07:47.689 --> 1:07:50.271
Larry: Hold on.
- I'm trying. I'm trying.

1:07:50.441 --> 1:07:52.147
Barry:
Tie them up. See what they've got.

1:07:52.318 --> 1:07:53.353
I'm trying.

1:07:53.528 --> 1:07:55.689
If I could just think about my mother.

1:07:55.905 --> 1:07:56.985
Put the cuffs on.

1:08:00.285 --> 1:08:01.900
Larry:
You think that scares me, dorgan?

1:08:02.370 --> 1:08:04.651
At this point, a shot in the head
looks pretty good to me.

1:08:04.789 --> 1:08:07.121
Don't make this harder
than it has to be.

1:08:07.292 --> 1:08:09.248
You think I could do that?

1:08:09.460 --> 1:08:10.460
Tell me something, chief,

1:08:10.628 --> 1:08:13.290
they teach you this one
at Santa Monica pd .?

1:08:13.756 --> 1:08:15.337
Huh?

1:09:07.727 --> 1:09:10.890
You propose nothing
in the sight of god.

1:09:11.439 --> 1:09:13.270
I will fear no evil

1:09:14.484 --> 1:09:16.270
ooh

1:09:16.653 --> 1:09:19.941
listen to me, all of you!

1:09:20.865 --> 1:09:23.026
I don't expect you to stop this,

1:09:23.743 --> 1:09:27.281
but you better remember
what you see here tonight,

1:09:27.914 --> 1:09:32.203
because the next time,
it may be your turn to die this way.

1:09:34.671 --> 1:09:36.753
Finished, Mr. Underwood?

1:09:36.964 --> 1:09:38.955
You're the one who's finished.

1:09:39.467 --> 1:09:40.877
I take that as a yes.

1:09:48.309 --> 1:09:51.676
L, Randall flagg,
do hereby state that these men...

1:09:51.813 --> 1:09:54.805
Ralph: Why don't you tell them
your real name?

1:09:56.234 --> 1:10:00.273
Flagg: Do hereby state that
these men are the insurrectionists

1:10:00.446 --> 1:10:01.902
responsible for the destruction

1:10:02.073 --> 1:10:04.780
of our unarmed scout planes
at Indian Springs

1:10:04.951 --> 1:10:07.442
and for the murder of Carl hough.

1:10:07.620 --> 1:10:12.614
For these crimes, they are sentenced
to death by dismemberment.

1:10:26.639 --> 1:10:30.552
It is the duty of each of you
to witness this punishment.

1:10:30.935 --> 1:10:34.143
However, those of you
with small children are excused.

1:10:34.689 --> 1:10:35.849
Take it, Barry.

1:10:43.573 --> 1:10:45.154
Whitney: Wait!

1:10:45.700 --> 1:10:47.236
Hey, you people.

1:10:47.410 --> 1:10:49.992
This ain't how Americans act

1:10:50.371 --> 1:10:52.783
we gotta stop this.

1:10:54.208 --> 1:10:56.324
We gotta stop this.

1:10:57.712 --> 1:10:59.043
Whitney.

1:11:03.342 --> 1:11:05.253
You should've kept still.

1:11:05.428 --> 1:11:07.919
I would've let you go.

1:11:08.556 --> 1:11:12.674
Why would I wanna keep
a jellyfish like you around, anyway?

1:11:25.656 --> 1:11:28.398
Sort of gives a whole new meaning
to the phrase "my lips are sealed,"

1:11:28.534 --> 1:11:30.024
doesn't it, Whitney?

1:11:31.037 --> 1:11:33.073
Trashcan man: Cibola

1:11:34.207 --> 1:11:35.913
cibola

1:11:36.417 --> 1:11:37.953
bumpty, bumpty, bump

1:11:38.878 --> 1:11:40.869
the fire for you.

1:11:41.088 --> 1:11:44.000
The big one for you.

1:11:47.428 --> 1:11:50.636
The big one for you.

1:11:52.308 --> 1:11:55.800
Bumpty, bumpty, bump

1:12:07.824 --> 1:12:10.566
Oh, my god. It's a bomb.

1:12:10.743 --> 1:12:13.200
He's got a bomb!

1:12:22.296 --> 1:12:25.254
- Get him out of here, Lloyd.
Trashcan man: I brought it for you.

1:12:26.092 --> 1:12:28.128
For you.

1:12:28.344 --> 1:12:30.460
(Get him out of here.

1:12:33.015 --> 1:12:37.008
My life for you.

1:12:45.736 --> 1:12:47.442
Lloyd: Trash.

1:12:48.990 --> 1:12:50.651
Trashcan man: That you, Lloyd?

1:12:52.660 --> 1:12:54.742
I can't see very well.

1:12:54.912 --> 1:12:59.030
My eyes. They're all funny.

1:12:59.542 --> 1:13:01.783
It's me, trashy.
What do you have there?

1:13:02.879 --> 1:13:04.995
The big one.

1:13:05.423 --> 1:13:07.334
Fire.

1:13:08.175 --> 1:13:10.632
The a-bomb.

1:13:14.724 --> 1:13:17.807
The fire for you.

1:13:18.728 --> 1:13:20.138
Listen to me, trash.

1:13:20.313 --> 1:13:22.975
You have to get that away.
It's dangerous.

1:13:27.820 --> 1:13:31.438
Come back. Come back, you cowards.

1:13:34.035 --> 1:13:36.321
Shoot him, Lloyd.
Kill the crazy bastard.

1:13:55.932 --> 1:14:00.596
Abagail: The promise has been kept
as god has willed it. Amen.

1:14:03.397 --> 1:14:04.603
Ralph: Larry.

1:14:05.942 --> 1:14:07.478
Do you see it?

1:14:09.946 --> 1:14:11.902
The hand of god.

1:14:12.114 --> 1:14:15.948
- Get away.
- The fire.

1:14:17.036 --> 1:14:22.030
The fire for you.

1:14:22.833 --> 1:14:24.198
Amazing grace.

1:14:30.299 --> 1:14:32.415
Abagail: You done good, boys.

1:14:32.635 --> 1:14:34.091
Come on home.

1:14:34.971 --> 1:14:36.507
Take us home.

1:14:53.948 --> 1:14:56.280
I saw a pale horse.

1:14:56.951 --> 1:14:59.658
A pale rider upon it.

1:15:00.538 --> 1:15:03.871
The name of the horse
was pestilence.

1:15:04.792 --> 1:15:09.001
The name of the rider was death.

1:15:12.633 --> 1:15:14.794
What was it, stu?

1:15:19.015 --> 1:15:21.802
It's the end of Las Vegas, Tommy.

1:15:23.561 --> 1:15:26.223
And the end of Randall flagg,

1:15:27.481 --> 1:15:29.688
if god is good.

1:15:31.736 --> 1:15:34.227
What about Glen and Larry?

1:15:35.197 --> 1:15:37.062
What about Ralph?

1:16:01.140 --> 1:16:02.596
Stu: Are you ready, Tom?

1:16:02.767 --> 1:16:04.348
Tom: Okay.

1:16:12.026 --> 1:16:13.982
Oh, please, god.

1:16:14.570 --> 1:16:16.526
Just a little help.

1:16:17.406 --> 1:16:19.362
Okay, let's give it a try.

1:16:25.039 --> 1:16:30.375
Stu: Okay, hop in. Come on.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

1:16:33.839 --> 1:16:35.750
Okay. Here goes.

1:16:38.928 --> 1:16:40.919
- All right.
- Ls...? Is it?

1:16:41.138 --> 1:16:43.550
Is it gonna be okay, stu?
Is it gonna be okay?

1:16:45.810 --> 1:16:48.176
I think maybe
we just caught us a break.

1:17:08.415 --> 1:17:12.124
Tom: This'll make you feel better, stu.
It's peanut butter and jelly.

1:17:12.294 --> 1:17:15.832
M-o-o-n.
That spells "peanut butter and jelly."

1:17:16.006 --> 1:17:19.089
My mom always made it for me
when I was feeling poorly.

1:17:19.260 --> 1:17:21.501
Always perked me up.

1:17:22.096 --> 1:17:24.678
Stu. Please eat, St...

1:17:24.849 --> 1:17:26.885
You gotta eat.

1:17:27.309 --> 1:17:29.015
Stu

1:17:30.563 --> 1:17:34.351
stu, if you don't eat, you'll die.

1:17:34.775 --> 1:17:37.312
I'll be alone, St...

1:17:37.778 --> 1:17:40.485
You gotta eat for me, St...

1:18:18.569 --> 1:18:20.525
Please.

1:18:21.197 --> 1:18:24.735
Please, stu, don't die.

1:18:30.289 --> 1:18:31.904
Nick: Tom.

1:18:33.334 --> 1:18:34.790
Is it really you?

1:18:45.346 --> 1:18:47.086
Stu said you were dead.

1:18:48.057 --> 1:18:50.218
Stu is very sick, you know.

1:18:50.392 --> 1:18:53.850
I know. He's got the flu.

1:18:54.688 --> 1:18:57.395
I tried to feed him
like my mama used to,

1:18:57.566 --> 1:18:59.682
but he wouldn't eat.

1:18:59.860 --> 1:19:01.942
I'm scared, Nick.

1:19:02.112 --> 1:19:05.525
It's all right. I know what to do.

1:19:19.004 --> 1:19:20.835
Come on, Tom.

1:19:29.473 --> 1:19:32.806
This'll make you better. Laws, yes.

1:19:41.193 --> 1:19:43.900
How'd you know to get this stuff,
Tommy?

1:19:44.071 --> 1:19:45.686
Nick told me.

1:19:47.241 --> 1:19:49.197
In my dreams, he can talk.

1:19:49.368 --> 1:19:51.404
Did I ever tell you that?

1:19:52.329 --> 1:19:53.910
Yeah

1:19:54.456 --> 1:19:56.242
I think you did.

1:21:06.653 --> 1:21:08.109
Tom?

1:21:09.740 --> 1:21:11.230
Hey.

1:21:13.660 --> 1:21:15.651
Tommy, what's wrong?

1:21:17.664 --> 1:21:21.248
Can't remember
what Nick looked like anymore.

1:21:22.044 --> 1:21:24.911
He was the best friend I ever had.

1:21:26.048 --> 1:21:28.130
Gave me a bike,

1:21:28.467 --> 1:21:30.753
was always good to me.

1:21:30.928 --> 1:21:33.544
I can't remember him anymore.

1:21:34.223 --> 1:21:37.511
I'm so stupid.
Can't remember nothing.

1:21:37.684 --> 1:21:39.174
Hey.

1:21:39.853 --> 1:21:43.345
There's a lot of important stuff
you didn't forget.

1:21:43.899 --> 1:21:46.015
I'm still alive.

1:21:46.568 --> 1:21:49.401
I wouldn't be if it wasn't for you.

1:21:51.115 --> 1:21:52.980
Tom: Really going home, stu?

1:21:53.158 --> 1:21:55.820
Like Dorothy in the wizard of oz?

1:21:56.745 --> 1:21:59.657
Stu: You bet. We're going home.

1:22:47.087 --> 1:22:48.873
Teddy:
This is nuts, you know it?

1:22:49.381 --> 1:22:51.838
Won't be anybody else
in here this winter.

1:22:52.009 --> 1:22:53.499
It is winter.

1:22:53.677 --> 1:22:56.464
It's early, but it is here.

1:23:07.357 --> 1:23:08.597
Now, be careful.

1:23:09.151 --> 1:23:12.143
- It could be stu or it could be...
- Hell, it could be anybody.

1:23:12.654 --> 1:23:16.272
Teddy: Hey, who is it there?

1:23:16.450 --> 1:23:19.192
You guys identify yourselves
or we're gonna shoot.

1:23:27.377 --> 1:23:30.744
It's them it's them.

1:23:32.674 --> 1:23:35.131
Teddy: Stu. - Hey, Teddy.

1:23:35.385 --> 1:23:36.841
- Tom Cullen.
Stu: Hey, there, Bobby.

1:23:36.970 --> 1:23:40.258
Man, I don't believe it.
What happened to your leg, stu?

1:23:40.432 --> 1:23:42.263
I broke it. Never mind. Never mind.

1:23:42.434 --> 1:23:44.220
We're frozen. Let's get in the truck.

1:23:44.394 --> 1:23:47.136
Then I want you to take me home
to see frannie.

1:23:49.942 --> 1:23:52.979
What? Come on.

1:23:53.987 --> 1:23:55.852
What's wrong? Teddy: Stu.

1:23:56.990 --> 1:23:58.571
Stu: What is it?

1:23:58.742 --> 1:24:01.905
I don't exactly know
how to tell you this, St...

1:24:03.288 --> 1:24:05.199
What? What is it?

1:24:05.332 --> 1:24:08.199
Well, it's the baby.

1:24:10.921 --> 1:24:14.288
It's come early and it's got the flu.

1:24:27.688 --> 1:24:29.349
Fran?

1:24:36.488 --> 1:24:38.399
Stuart?

1:24:40.158 --> 1:24:42.023
Is this a dream?

1:24:43.453 --> 1:24:45.990
No, darling. It's no dream.

1:24:47.249 --> 1:24:48.409
Ohh.

1:25:03.098 --> 1:25:04.884
I can't believe

1:25:07.811 --> 1:25:09.642
I can't

1:25:13.233 --> 1:25:16.350
so now I'm just waiting
for it to be over.

1:25:16.820 --> 1:25:20.904
Then maybe you and I
can think about starting all over again.

1:25:21.950 --> 1:25:23.750
But George says
that there's no way of knowing

1:25:23.869 --> 1:25:26.736
if any of the babies
are gonna be immune.

1:25:27.414 --> 1:25:29.200
Let's not think about that now, frannie.

1:25:29.333 --> 1:25:31.198
I can't help it.

1:25:31.376 --> 1:25:34.960
I have this big black hole
in the middle of me.

1:25:35.088 --> 1:25:38.046
I can't help thinking,
what did we all do this for?

1:25:38.216 --> 1:25:39.216
Why?

1:25:41.428 --> 1:25:44.636
You propose nothing
in the sight of god.

1:25:45.974 --> 1:25:47.680
Come on.

1:25:57.986 --> 1:26:00.853
For now, there's us, at least,
you know.

1:26:01.114 --> 1:26:02.650
I know.

1:26:03.075 --> 1:26:06.738
Stu, I can't tell you
how glad I am to see you.

1:26:06.912 --> 1:26:09.574
- How glad all of us are.
- Hey, doc.

1:26:09.748 --> 1:26:11.488
The baby's dead, isn't it?

1:26:11.667 --> 1:26:13.658
No, quite the opposite.

1:26:13.835 --> 1:26:15.496
I believe the crisis has passed.

1:26:17.547 --> 1:26:21.540
You mean she's going to be all right?

1:26:21.760 --> 1:26:25.093
Yes. I think the baby's gonna live.

1:26:26.807 --> 1:26:28.138
Fran: Ohh

1:26:50.122 --> 1:26:51.487
George: It was a tough battle.

1:26:52.082 --> 1:26:56.200
And a lot of the year-one babies
may not do as well as this one.

1:26:56.503 --> 1:26:59.620
But when both parents are immune,

1:26:59.881 --> 1:27:03.214
you will see the last
of captain trips.

1:27:04.511 --> 1:27:05.842
It's a miracle.

1:27:06.722 --> 1:27:08.553
George: Yes, indeed.

1:27:09.391 --> 1:27:13.259
You got a beautiful daughter there,
Fran. You take good care of her.

1:27:13.478 --> 1:27:15.014
I will

1:27:15.897 --> 1:27:17.637
we will

1:27:21.486 --> 1:27:22.976
Fran: Hi.
“We can come back later.

1:27:23.155 --> 1:27:24.395
Stu: Oh, no.

1:27:24.573 --> 1:27:26.029
No

1:27:26.199 --> 1:27:28.565
Hey. Lucy: You're limping.

1:27:29.035 --> 1:27:30.315
Stu: And I hear you're pregnant.

1:27:30.370 --> 1:27:31.610
Yeah

1:27:31.788 --> 1:27:32.948
Joey.

1:27:33.957 --> 1:27:35.572
Hey, Joey.

1:27:40.005 --> 1:27:41.620
Lucy.

1:27:43.633 --> 1:27:45.589
Larry... Lucy: No. I know.

1:27:46.094 --> 1:27:47.925
I know what happened.

1:27:50.557 --> 1:27:55.142
I'm sure that when the end came,

1:27:57.105 --> 1:27:58.686
they met it on their feet.

1:27:58.857 --> 1:28:01.269
And that's what they were
sent out there to do, wasn't it?

1:28:01.443 --> 1:28:03.024
To stand.

1:28:04.696 --> 1:28:06.687
I reckon it was.

1:28:07.866 --> 1:28:09.652
He's gone,

1:28:10.202 --> 1:28:11.658
but I'll have his baby.

1:28:12.496 --> 1:28:17.786
Maybe it's not all I wanted
or all I dreamed of having,

1:28:18.960 --> 1:28:21.292
but it'll have to be enough.

1:28:42.108 --> 1:28:45.020
Don't cry. She's gonna be just fine.

1:28:46.029 --> 1:28:48.441
She's so beautiful.

1:28:48.657 --> 1:28:51.399
No, I'm not crying for her.

1:28:51.785 --> 1:28:53.946
It's all of the others.

1:28:54.162 --> 1:28:56.403
All those empty cradles.

1:28:57.958 --> 1:28:59.698
Pink baby.

1:29:02.087 --> 1:29:03.497
Joey: Ooh. Ooh.

1:29:03.922 --> 1:29:06.755
I know, honey.
They're looking at the baby.

1:29:07.551 --> 1:29:10.588
Ain't you beautiful?

1:29:10.846 --> 1:29:15.215
Just as gorgeous as dawn in Eden.

1:29:43.837 --> 1:29:45.543
Fran,

1:29:47.173 --> 1:29:49.789
do you think people can change?

1:29:52.679 --> 1:29:55.170
Do you think that's possible?

1:29:57.392 --> 1:29:59.303
I don't know.

1:29:59.728 --> 1:30:02.140
I really don't know.

1:30:04.941 --> 1:30:06.932
Maybe she does.
