AKU: Long ago, in a distant land,

00:04.589 --> 00:09.052
I, Aku, the shape-shifting
master of darkness,

00:09.385 --> 00:12.805
unleashed an unspeakable evil,

00:13.139 --> 00:16.017
but a foolish samurai warrior

Now the fool seeks to return to the past

00:38.456 --> 00:43.169
and undo the future that is Aku.

Since the beginning of history,

the immortal Aku has

14:04.219 --> 14:06.764
plundering its resources as he sees fit.

14:06.930 --> 14:08.682
But it was still not enough.

14:08.766 --> 14:10.559
He opened his ports to the galaxy

14:10.642 --> 14:13.854
so that he might take the riches
of other worlds, as well.

14:14.104 --> 14:16.690
Since then,
his other worldly business affairs

14:16.774 --> 14:18.734
have drawn scads of ruthless criminals,

14:18.817 --> 14:23.238
mindless stooges, and questionable
mercenaries to our pitiable planet,

14:23.614 --> 14:26.950

There are other worlds across the stars?

Well of course, silly.

14:34.792 --> 14:36.960
What world do you hail from?

14:37.127 --> 14:38.545
But I am from earth,

14:38.879 --> 14:41.340
yet this world is nothing like
the world I remember.

14:41.465 --> 14:42.466
How so, lad?

Even the grandest cities were never

Well I mean no insult.

- You see? The ancient myths are true!

15:00.401 --> 15:01.485
Impossible!

15:01.693 --> 15:05.823
If what you say is true,
he'd have to be thousands of years old.

15:08.784 --> 15:10.285
(GASPS) Astounding.

15:10.369 --> 15:13.747
The age-o-meter dates your particles
all the way back to 25 B.A.

15:13.831 --> 15:16.500
25 years before Aku enslaved the earth.

15:17.376 --> 15:20.295
You, my friend, are a living fossil.

15:22.172 --> 15:24.925
So the question is not where I am,
but when I am.

15:25.008 --> 15:26.009
Precisely.

15:26.093 --> 15:28.679
The spell Aku cast
must have ripped me from my own time

15:28.804 --> 15:30.681
and flung me into the distant future.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.224
Time warp is highly plausible.

15:32.307 --> 15:35.769
Allowing his evil time to fester
and infect the entire world.

15:35.894 --> 15:37.438
MCDUFFY: Oh, most undoubtedly,

15:37.521 --> 15:41.233
and I'm sure he plans to spread
his vileness through the stars.

15:41.316 --> 15:43.569
No, I must return to my own time

15:43.652 --> 15:47.239
so that I might undo Aku's evil reign
before it envelopes the earth.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.033
This ageless demon must be stopped.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.077
Oh! I'm so glad we agree on that point,

15:52.536 --> 15:54.913
which actually brings us
back to our proposal.

15:54.997 --> 15:58.834
You see, we are archaeologists trying to
dig up the remains of our ancestors

15:58.917 --> 16:00.919
to find out more about our past.

16:01.003 --> 16:04.298
It was only a few years ago
that we discovered that our ancestors

16:04.381 --> 16:06.758
walked upon their legs and their arms.

16:08.302 --> 16:10.679
Then one day during our excavation,

16:10.762 --> 16:13.724
we actually stumbled upon rare jewels.

16:13.849 --> 16:18.395
Aye. These jewels ended up
being a key source of power for Aku.

16:18.479 --> 16:21.607
So he enslaved us
to forever dig up his jewels,

16:21.857 --> 16:24.860
thus stifling our excavation
of our glorious past,

16:25.319 --> 16:27.196
which is why we need you.

16:27.279 --> 16:28.447
But what can I do?

16:28.655 --> 16:32.576
With your tremendous skill, you can
break us free from the grasp of Aku

16:32.659 --> 16:36.747
and we can escape in secret
to again continue to discover our history.

16:43.420 --> 16:44.796
I will help you.

16:46.256 --> 16:48.425
Splendid. Well, we're off, then.

16:51.887 --> 16:54.014
- Hold it!
- What is it now, Rothy?

16:54.097 --> 16:56.808
- What's wrong?
- My dearest apologies, kind sir,

16:57.017 --> 16:59.311
but we never got your name.

17:01.271 --> 17:02.314
- Jack!
- Jack, was all...

17:02.397 --> 17:03.398

17:04.566 --> 17:06.151
- Jack!
- Jack!Jack!

17:11.114 --> 17:12.658
They call me Jack.

17:15.410 --> 17:18.121
Jack. I say, that's quite nice.
So simple, but it seems to fit.

17:18.205 --> 17:20.791
But who am I to comment?
Well, Jack, we're on our way.

17:20.874 --> 17:22.209
We'll take our rocket ship.

17:22.292 --> 17:23.418
Rocket ship?

17:27.297 --> 17:28.465
I'm taking a break.

18:07.004 --> 18:09.089
(ELECTRIC WHIRRING)

18:19.850 --> 18:23.103
My lord, we are the manaquas,
from the mosconian galaxy.

18:23.186 --> 18:24.855
Our water planet has been pillaged

18:24.938 --> 18:27.649
and all the oceans
that were once our home are gone.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.401
We have searched long and hard

18:29.484 --> 18:32.696
to find a planet with oceans
rich enough to sustain our people

18:32.779 --> 18:35.574
And your world is our
last hope for survival.

18:50.714 --> 18:53.550
I know of your plight, Manaquain,

18:53.634 --> 18:59.765
for you see I am he who has taken
your water and the riches within them.

18:59.848 --> 19:02.059
- You monster!
- Be quiet!

19:02.142 --> 19:03.310
I am sorry, my lord.

19:03.685 --> 19:05.312
The boy is young and foolish.

19:05.395 --> 19:06.938
He does not know what he says.

19:10.776 --> 19:12.277
(CRYING)

19:12.486 --> 19:14.863
The boy will return.

19:15.489 --> 19:21.411
He will learn proper respect for Aku
in the pit of hate.

19:21.578 --> 19:24.790
Yes, O master, your wisdom
is unquestionable,

19:25.040 --> 19:27.000
but with you, good Lord Aku,

19:27.125 --> 19:31.129
allow us to inhabit your world,
for you are our only hope.

19:31.213 --> 19:33.465
You will be allowed.

19:33.548 --> 19:37.511
The oceans of Aku will be your new home,

19:38.011 --> 19:43.767
but you will pay homage to me
by constructing statues in my likeness.

19:43.934 --> 19:47.354
Once a month, a monolithic tribute

19:47.437 --> 19:50.982
will rise from the depths of the ocean

19:51.066 --> 19:56.530
to remind all
who is the master of this world.

19:56.697 --> 19:58.115
Now be gone!

20:00.534 --> 20:03.578
My Lord, Master,
I have great news for you.

20:03.954 --> 20:08.959
What information can be considered great
for the immortal Aku?

20:09.167 --> 20:13.463
An ancient warrior of great power
and skill has revealed himself.

20:13.714 --> 20:17.092
He has vowed to liberate the canines
from your mines.

20:17.175 --> 20:19.553
What impertinence is this?

20:19.761 --> 20:21.763
Show me the fool!

20:28.603 --> 20:31.732
(LAUGHING)

20:32.607 --> 20:34.776
So fate has arrived.

20:34.943 --> 20:41.658
Many years have gone since that day,
and now my formidable foe,

20:41.908 --> 20:48.749
you will pay for my pain in the past
with your pain in the future.

20:48.915 --> 20:52.669
(EVIL LAUGHTER)

20:53.545 --> 20:55.255
(ENGINE STARTING)

21:16.151 --> 21:17.235
(GROWLS)

21:33.668 --> 21:35.796
Oh, dear, sir Jack, are you ill?

21:36.087 --> 21:38.423
I'm fine. I just prefer walking.

21:38.548 --> 21:40.050
Oh, yes. Rocket rides and such.

21:40.133 --> 21:43.804
Sorry about that, old timer,
but anyway, welcome to our camp.

21:44.054 --> 21:46.097
As you can see, our archaeological dig

21:46.181 --> 21:48.308
had unearthed many astounding discoveries

21:48.391 --> 21:50.227
concerning the history of canine-kind,

21:50.310 --> 21:55.899
but unfortunately, Aku has, shall we say,
redirected our efforts

21:55.982 --> 21:59.069
purely toward the excavation
of his precious gems.

21:59.236 --> 22:01.947
And if Aku's unreasonable quotas
are not fully met,

22:02.155 --> 22:04.783
I'm afraid terrible punishments
are exacted.

22:05.325 --> 22:07.452
My peoples' spirits are broken.

22:07.828 --> 22:10.539
We simply cannot
live like this any longer!

22:24.261 --> 22:28.223
I have seen Aku implement
these atrocities before, but no more.

22:28.515 --> 22:31.142
Even dogs should not be forced
to live like dogs.

22:31.268 --> 22:32.269
Ahem.

22:33.270 --> 22:35.188
They're coming! They're coming!

22:35.355 --> 22:37.649
Aku's drones approach from the south!

22:37.732 --> 22:39.651
They will be upon us by sunrise!
