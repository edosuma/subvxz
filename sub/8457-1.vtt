00:34.600 --> 00:35.750
What happened?

00:36.080 --> 00:37.200
The lights went out.

00:37.235 --> 00:38.316
Why?

00:40.440 --> 00:41.715
This is normal.

00:44.160 --> 00:46.152
The lights are out all over the world.

00:46.720 --> 00:48.837
The lights are out all over Egypt.

00:49.320 --> 00:52.199
Everything is like this
it's not just the electricity.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.076
Electricity is the least
of our problems.

00:55.480 --> 00:59.520
And all the little kids in the streets say,
"Turn the lights back on man. "

01:00.080 --> 01:01.912
Who is the "man"?

01:02.120 --> 01:05.716
The man who's responsible for
switching the electricity back on.

01:06.520 --> 01:09.354
The regime.

01:14.440 --> 01:16.318
- Are you recording?
- Yes

01:16.440 --> 01:17.510
- Really recording?
- Yes

01:17.960 --> 01:20.600
Ok. Do as you like.

01:25.200 --> 01:28.318
Let me tell you how this whole story began.

01:29.640 --> 01:33.236
Egypt was living without dignity.

01:34.120 --> 01:36.032
Injustice existed everywhere.

01:37.880 --> 01:41.760
Before the revolution I lived
from one job to the next.

01:42.720 --> 01:45.394
I started working when I was 8 years old.

01:46.600 --> 01:50.037
In fifth grade, I used
to pay my school tuition

01:51.000 --> 01:53.276
By selling lemons in the street.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.440
There was no hope for a
better future in this country.

02:04.080 --> 02:08.279
We were tied down by
an unjust regime and its dictator.

02:09.560 --> 02:11.405
Mubarak was the head of the regime

02:11.440 --> 02:15.559
That forced us to live for 30 years
under emergency law.

02:15.800 --> 02:20.272
I lived my entire life
under Mubarak's injustice.

02:21.360 --> 02:24.671
The regime always worked against the people.

02:26.360 --> 02:30.320
They would torture, electrocute,
beat the shit out of people.

02:31.120 --> 02:33.680
No one dared to speak about politics.

02:34.280 --> 02:36.875
Politics was for the regime only.

02:38.440 --> 02:40.238
Oh my God people.

02:40.840 --> 02:45.392
<i>"KHALED SAEED, VICTIM OF TORTURE"</i>

02:48.720 --> 02:50.598
We want to go to Tahrir Square

02:50.680 --> 02:56.040
If we have any dignity and want
to live as humans in this country

02:56.075 --> 02:58.111
Then we have to go to the streets.

02:58.200 --> 03:01.272
We will go down and demand our
fundamental human rights.

03:01.520 --> 03:05.753
I am going down and I will say
"No" to corruption. "No" to this regime.

03:07.840 --> 03:10.196
I went to the streets.

03:13.120 --> 03:15.874
I found everyone around me

03:16.800 --> 03:19.918
Felt just as I did.

03:20.720 --> 03:24.600
<i>The people want to end corruption.</i>

03:26.680 --> 03:28.956
<i>Peaceful</i>

03:31.720 --> 03:34.235
The police tried to divide us
with all they had.

03:44.680 --> 03:46.160
People got angry

03:48.240 --> 03:49.754
And broke their fears.

03:54.880 --> 03:57.395
I'm not afraid for myself.
I'm afraid for you.

03:57.680 --> 03:59.399
And for what the future holds.

03:59.960 --> 04:02.634
Everyone is in the streets.
Come down for God's sake.

04:02.840 --> 04:05.719
Tell those who have been sleeping in shit.

04:06.160 --> 04:10.837
For the sake of your kids and family,
so you can live.

04:17.560 --> 04:19.596
Go ahead Sir.

04:21.360 --> 04:24.000
I would like to address

04:24.080 --> 04:27.710
Egypt's youth
in Tahrir Square.

04:29.640 --> 04:33.873
I speak to all of you
from the heart,

04:34.480 --> 04:37.154
Like a father
to his sons and daughters.

04:43.720 --> 04:45.473
I take pride in you

04:45.640 --> 04:48.439
As a symbol
of a new Egyptian generation

04:49.240 --> 04:52.870
Determined to achieve changes.

04:57.760 --> 05:01.310
Egypt is facing difficult times.

05:03.800 --> 05:07.271
I'm afraid for the outcome
of this situation

05:07.480 --> 05:12.111
And that the youth
who are calling for change

05:12.360 --> 05:14.352
Will be the first
to suffer the consequences.

05:18.800 --> 05:21.440
We have taken Tahrir Square!

05:22.400 --> 05:25.916
<i>The people demand the fall of the regime.</i>

05:43.560 --> 05:46.678
The entire nation erupted at once

05:47.440 --> 05:52.037
To battle injustice, corruption,
poverty, ignorance

05:52.680 --> 05:57.118
All that we endured
over the past 30 years.

06:00.560 --> 06:02.153
We were all equal.

06:02.520 --> 06:03.840
Reflections of each other.

06:05.360 --> 06:06.430
<i>Freedom</i>

06:06.840 --> 06:08.320
<i>Freedom</i>

06:08.440 --> 06:09.794
<i>Freedom</i>

06:10.520 --> 06:11.920
I swore to God

06:12.000 --> 06:14.231
That I wouldn't leave the Square

06:14.800 --> 06:16.712
Until our demands were met.

06:24.640 --> 06:27.200
I met Magdy Ashour in the Square.

06:27.600 --> 06:31.071
Magdy is a member of
the Muslim Brotherhood.

06:31.200 --> 06:33.760
<i>Your bullets won't hurt us.</i>

06:34.440 --> 06:35.840
Khalid Abdalla

06:36.160 --> 06:41.360
An Egyptian who was born abroad
but came back to Egypt never to leave.

06:42.600 --> 06:43.556
Aida

06:44.200 --> 06:47.432
<i>Freedom is for everyone.</i>

06:47.920 --> 06:49.479
Ramy Essam

06:49.800 --> 06:52.440
He became known
as the singer of the revolution.

06:52.680 --> 06:55.514
<i>Bread, freedom, social justice.</i>

06:55.720 --> 06:57.951
I swear I'm staying here with you.

07:03.280 --> 07:06.079
We found ourselves loving
each other without realizing it.

07:06.800 --> 07:07.916
Hey guys!

07:08.040 --> 07:08.920
We going home?

07:08.955 --> 07:09.671
Hell No!

07:09.760 --> 07:10.440
We going home?

07:10.475 --> 07:11.396
Hell No!

07:11.480 --> 07:14.120
<i>Then it's a sit-in</i>

07:14.160 --> 07:16.994
<i>Sit-in</i>

07:17.200 --> 07:20.433
<i>Until Mubarak leaves</i>

07:21.400 --> 07:23.471
There was no such thing
as Muslim or Christian.

07:23.840 --> 07:25.638
We were all present.

07:26.280 --> 07:27.555
We were one hand.

07:27.880 --> 07:28.950
<i>One hand!</i>

07:29.160 --> 07:30.196
<i>One hand!</i>

07:30.640 --> 07:31.869
<i>One hand!</i>

07:34.440 --> 07:38.320
We will fill the world with our poetry.

07:38.680 --> 07:40.717
Our words will stand in the Square.

07:41.240 --> 07:45.029
And they will be like bullets in this war.

07:45.400 --> 07:48.950
<i>Revolution until victory!</i>

07:49.160 --> 07:51.470
<i>Revolution on ecery street in Egypt!</i>

07:51.720 --> 07:53.393
<i>Leave Mubarak!</i>

07:58.400 --> 08:02.189
This is when we realized that
people are the true power.

08:03.560 --> 08:06.632
Every 5 seconds,
thousands join the sit-in.

08:07.920 --> 08:10.799
We won't leave the Square
until our demands are met.

08:15.480 --> 08:17.711
We've never had our rights.

08:17.800 --> 08:21.271
Finally we have this piece of land
to call our own

08:21.920 --> 08:25.440
And to claim our rights on.

08:25.475 --> 08:26.510
And now, it's ours.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.279
It's not too much to ask for.

08:28.640 --> 08:29.915
Tahrir Square is nothing

08:30.280 --> 08:33.636
Compared to the thousands
of acres they stole.

08:35.360 --> 08:36.554
Tea anyone?

08:37.280 --> 08:38.475
Tea anyone?

08:42.720 --> 08:44.837
I told you we'd have
some tea together.

08:44.920 --> 08:46.036
You too have some tea.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.871
If I were to talk on behalf
of some of the Islamists

08:50.080 --> 08:53.152
Who's to say who's
an example of Islam?

08:53.840 --> 08:58.960
The ideas we've adopted since
the start of the revolution are beautiful

08:59.960 --> 09:01.519
The idea that we're one society.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.874
To imagine that one day I would
be standing in Tahrir Square

09:04.920 --> 09:06.559
In solidarity with all these people

09:06.880 --> 09:08.280
I could never have imagined it.

10:40.760 --> 10:42.194
God be with you.

10:42.320 --> 10:45.552
I am telling you
good things are coming.

10:46.560 --> 10:48.995
Good things.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.394
Thank God.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.759
<i>Down with Mubarak!</i>

10:55.400 --> 10:57.073
<i>Down with Mubarak!</i>

10:57.760 --> 10:59.433
<i>Down with Mubarak!</i>

11:02.760 --> 11:04.991
President Mohammed
Hosni Mubarak

11:05.920 --> 11:08.480
Has decided to give up
his position as President,

11:08.520 --> 11:11.513
Entrusting the Armed Forces

11:11.680 --> 11:13.353
With the management
of the nation.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.632
We all understand

11:15.760 --> 11:17.558
The magnitude of his decision.

11:17.720 --> 11:20.758
The Supreme Council
of the Armed Forces

11:21.000 --> 11:24.277
Wholeheartedly salutes

11:24.560 --> 11:27.712
The revolutionaries who
lost their lives.

11:33.880 --> 11:36.440
He stepped down!

11:36.680 --> 11:39.240
He stepped down!

11:39.920 --> 11:42.230
Oh my God!

11:49.720 --> 11:50.597
Oh Egypt!

12:03.560 --> 12:07.873
Tahrir Square changed Egypt completely.
It moved the whole world.

12:08.960 --> 12:15.719
For the first time in our lives, we
couldn't be silenced.

12:19.920 --> 12:24.392
We reclaimed our freedom.

12:30.760 --> 12:33.878
And we dreamed that one day

12:34.880 --> 12:37.793
All of Egypt would be like Tahrir Square.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.550
Revolution

12:50.560 --> 12:52.153
Everyone,
clap your hands.

12:52.960 --> 12:54.599
Let's celebrate

12:55.720 --> 12:58.189
<i>We're all one hand</i>

12:58.520 --> 13:00.671
<i>And our demands are one</i>

13:00.960 --> 13:01.996
<i>A country by the people</i>

13:02.120 --> 13:02.997
<i>By the people</i>

13:03.200 --> 13:04.316
<i>By the people</i>

13:04.480 --> 13:05.596
<i>By the people</i>

13:13.000 --> 13:15.117
The mood here
is absolutely extraordinary.

13:15.800 --> 13:18.679
I think the really
interesting thing here

13:19.120 --> 13:22.557
For me, is the fact
that Mubarak's leaving

13:22.680 --> 13:24.478
Is not enough for the people.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.832
<i>My homeland, my homeland, my homeland</i>

14:05.120 --> 14:08.796
<i>You have my love and my heart.</i>

14:14.400 --> 14:16.710
The most beautiful thing
about this revolution

14:16.760 --> 14:19.798
Is that we were all united.

14:20.040 --> 14:26.310
We forgot our political differences
and came together.

14:26.840 --> 14:33.394
Soon people will realize that they
misunderstood the Muslim Brotherhood.

14:33.560 --> 14:36.075
Usually the Muslim Brotherhood
is our biggest fear.

14:36.400 --> 14:40.679
But everyone inside the
Square now is different.

14:53.640 --> 14:57.156
We are doing this
for our children.

14:57.360 --> 15:00.797
Even if I die, it's for the future.

15:00.960 --> 15:05.273
So now that Mubarak is gone,
we have to take control.

15:05.840 --> 15:07.274
The main thing
is taking the regime down.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.760
Whoever is negotiating
with them

15:09.000 --> 15:11.231
The regime is already down.

15:11.960 --> 15:14.395
If you take out people
and put people just like them

15:14.800 --> 15:16.553
From the same circle,
from the same regime

15:16.680 --> 15:19.673
Then you didn't take down the regime.
You took down the people.

15:22.640 --> 15:24.552
No one is going to kill you.

15:25.040 --> 15:27.111
I told you before

15:27.200 --> 15:31.752
The Army will sacrifice
their last drop of blood

15:32.080 --> 15:36.074
Before they fire a
single bullet on the people.

15:36.240 --> 15:39.916
Never.

15:40.160 --> 15:44.677
Now please pack your things
and go home.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.240
When Mubarak stepped down

16:02.200 --> 16:05.591
The Armed Forces took
over the country's affairs.

16:07.960 --> 16:11.078
They swore to God to meet
the people's demands.

16:12.480 --> 16:14.631
So people went home.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.399
And nothing happened.

16:18.880 --> 16:21.793
We didn't put the killers on trial
or change the government.

16:21.880 --> 16:25.317
There is no new constitution,
and the Secret Police are still in power.

16:26.160 --> 16:27.799
The regime is not just Mubarak.

16:27.840 --> 16:30.080
The regime is all
the country's institutions,

16:30.115 --> 16:32.197
and they all have to change.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.152
So we went back to the Square.

16:48.280 --> 16:52.797
We're entering Tahrir Square,
the place of pride and dignity

16:52.960 --> 16:57.239
Where a tent and a blanket
can solve all your problems.

16:57.440 --> 17:00.035
<i>We'll keep protesting.</i>

17:00.240 --> 17:02.550
<i>We'll keep protesting.</i>

17:02.800 --> 17:04.998
<i>We're staying here.
We're not going anywhere.</i>

17:05.032 --> 17:07.196
<i>We're staying here.
We're not going anywhere.</i>

17:07.440 --> 17:09.477
<i>We'll continue our revolution.</i>

17:09.599 --> 17:11.637
<i>We'll continue our revolution.</i>

17:14.400 --> 17:16.377
<i>Our revolution is
a people's revolution</i>

17:16.413 --> 17:18.357
<i>Our revolution is
a people's revolution</i>

17:18.440 --> 17:20.590
<i>Not a coalition's recolution
Nor a party's revolution.</i>

17:20.640 --> 17:21.756
<i>Not a coalition's recolution,
nor a party's revolution.</i>

18:51.560 --> 18:55.600
For the past 3 or 4 days people
would come and threaten us.

18:56.160 --> 18:58.356
They asked why we are here.

18:59.160 --> 19:01.391
We tried to explain to them

19:01.800 --> 19:04.110
The biggest mistake we made

19:04.440 --> 19:08.116
Was that we left the Square
before the power was in our hands.

19:09.960 --> 19:12.350
It takes time to convince people to join us.

19:12.440 --> 19:13.760
One person joins

19:13.800 --> 19:15.280
Then two and three.

19:15.320 --> 19:19.439
I find myself giving a speech to
40 or 50 people every two hours.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.405
I speak my heart out.

19:21.440 --> 19:23.245
People start to understand.

19:23.280 --> 19:25.875
Out of 40 or 50 people,
20 agree with me.

19:26.120 --> 19:27.952
And the numbers keep
getting bigger.

19:28.080 --> 19:29.400
It makes me so happy.

19:30.680 --> 19:33.070
Oh my God, look how big that pepper is.

19:33.160 --> 19:36.597
Look how big the pepper is,
now that the age of Mubarak is over.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.640
During his rule,
the peppers were tiny.

19:39.720 --> 19:43.714
Look how big they are now.
There is hope for the future.

19:53.080 --> 19:55.515
I don't think I look like a thug.

19:55.760 --> 19:58.275
You look like a lovely person

19:58.320 --> 19:59.674
And you're talking decently.

19:59.800 --> 20:00.517
We just need your I.D.

20:00.720 --> 20:02.120
- There is still a revolution.
- I know.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.392
- And there's a sit-in.
- Okay.

20:04.600 --> 20:05.405
And problems happen inside.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.113
And you are being searched
by Ramy Essam,

20:07.160 --> 20:08.880
The handsome singer
of our revolution.

20:08.915 --> 20:10.314
It's a great honor.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.994
I hope it's you every day.

20:15.120 --> 20:16.236
Tell me, what time do you come?

20:16.480 --> 20:17.231
We'll wait for you.

20:17.280 --> 20:19.920
Every day at 8 am and 4 pm.

20:20.880 --> 20:22.917
I look forward to it.

20:29.320 --> 20:30.436
Oh man, this is hard.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.517
Security takes skill.

20:35.920 --> 20:37.832
This is Egypt State Radio.

20:44.080 --> 20:47.437
I'm a General and Military Analyst.

20:47.640 --> 20:49.791
No, the title of expert
is a very big thing.

20:50.720 --> 20:54.839
If people have demands, they should
submit them to authorities

20:54.920 --> 20:57.754
And assign representatives.

20:57.800 --> 21:03.114
And they have
the media to complain to.

21:03.320 --> 21:06.518
If we and the government
don't succeed,

21:06.560 --> 21:11.316
Then they have the right to criticize.

21:11.880 --> 21:14.520
Protests gather people from
all walks of life.

21:14.555 --> 21:16.637
Was everyone in Tahrir a protester?

21:16.760 --> 21:18.433
Some had nothing to do
with the protest.

21:18.520 --> 21:22.719
Some went to Tahrir
to look like heroes.

21:22.800 --> 21:28.717
Today, anyone can pretend that they
were heroes of the revolution

21:29.200 --> 21:31.954
You were in the Square.
You know the type

21:32.040 --> 21:36.432
Some people went to get stoned,
or to steal, or some were thugs.

21:37.520 --> 21:42.197
There are three powers:
the secular somehow,

21:42.360 --> 21:46.070
The Islamist, and the old regime
led by the Army.

21:46.240 --> 21:49.153
The Army has won
part of this revolution.

21:49.280 --> 21:51.670
They wanted to stop Mubarak's
son from inheriting power.

21:51.760 --> 21:54.594
Once that happened, they wanted
people to go back home,

21:54.720 --> 21:59.954
And the country to go back
to its corrupt ways.

22:00.320 --> 22:03.515
The Army are the leaders
of the counter-revolution.

22:03.550 --> 22:06.710
You've already won a lot,
and it is threatened.

22:08.200 --> 22:10.396
This is a warning.

22:12.200 --> 22:15.637
Leave! Go home.

22:15.760 --> 22:17.194
If you don't leave,
I will shoot you.

22:17.240 --> 22:19.391
Egyptians do not revolt easily.

22:19.520 --> 22:23.230
For us to revolt,
it means we've had enough.

22:23.360 --> 22:24.157
Enough!

22:24.200 --> 22:26.680
We'll free our country,
no matter what.

22:26.715 --> 22:29.400
And we'll take down the regime.

22:29.520 --> 22:31.830
The people are determined
to continue their revolution.

22:31.920 --> 22:33.559
Do whatever you want to us

22:33.640 --> 22:35.871
We're staying,
this is our Square.

22:36.120 --> 22:38.589
The people are the source
of authority, not the Army.

22:38.760 --> 22:41.150
You are saying that
it's a peaceful protest.

22:41.320 --> 22:45.519
You think you can do
whatever you want

22:45.640 --> 22:47.677
And we won't attack you.

22:47.840 --> 22:50.480
But we will attack if necessary.

22:51.520 --> 22:53.432
That's how it is.
That's the end of it.

22:53.520 --> 22:54.360
You're imposing a curfew?

22:54.395 --> 22:55.510
Yes, God willing.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.116
You mean just in the Square?

22:57.160 --> 22:58.389
No, everywhere.

22:58.480 --> 23:00.233
But, Sir

23:01.080 --> 23:03.276
Mister, I'm afraid this won't do.

23:03.400 --> 23:04.231
But they told us yesterday,

23:04.400 --> 23:06.153
We could continue
the sit-in in the Square.

23:06.240 --> 23:07.196
- Off you go. Leave.
- Yes, sir.

23:08.160 --> 23:09.958
Why the Square in particular?

23:13.120 --> 23:16.079
We took these barricades
from the Police,

23:16.600 --> 23:20.719
So we'd be able to stop any attack.

23:21.520 --> 23:23.079
We do trust the Army.

23:23.240 --> 23:26.472
But there are some
leaders in the Army

23:26.560 --> 23:30.076
Who are corrupt because
they are part of Mubarak's era.

23:30.400 --> 23:31.445
Everyone's awake.

23:31.480 --> 23:34.552
There might be an attack at any time.

24:09.360 --> 24:10.794
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

24:11.840 --> 24:14.992
Guys, the Police and the
Army are standing together.

24:26.040 --> 24:28.236
Why do you have a camera?

24:28.400 --> 24:29.525
I'm a reporter

24:29.560 --> 24:31.398
Come here, I want to talk to you.

24:31.433 --> 24:33.237
- No
- I won't arrest you, I swear

24:33.280 --> 24:34.714
No, I'm sorry

24:35.480 --> 24:36.925
Calm down

24:36.960 --> 24:38.952
<i>Let him go! Let him go!
Don't arrest him!</i>

24:41.080 --> 24:43.640
Ok, ok. I'm coming with you.

24:47.280 --> 24:49.636
Pull down the barricade.

25:02.040 --> 25:05.875
So this is our Army!
Look at what they are doing!

25:06.600 --> 25:08.592
Don't talk shit about the Army!

25:14.760 --> 25:18.640
I can't believe this is happening!
We need to go back!

25:18.760 --> 25:19.671
Just stop it!

25:19.840 --> 25:22.355
They can't get away
with this shit!

25:22.560 --> 25:24.313
Fine.
Go back.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.995
We left people behind.

25:30.520 --> 25:31.795
Can we speak inside, please?

25:33.080 --> 25:34.355
Has anyone been killed?

25:36.920 --> 25:38.798
There's no news.

26:25.960 --> 26:27.440
Tahrir is symbolic land.

26:27.520 --> 26:30.274
If you've got control of it,
you have power.

26:30.320 --> 26:32.152
It pulls people to you.

26:33.600 --> 26:38.231
It wasn't on BBC. It wasn't on CNN.
It was nowhere.

26:40.040 --> 26:41.269
Ramy Essam?

26:41.320 --> 26:42.470
Can you call?

26:42.560 --> 26:44.631
Tell me the exact names

26:44.720 --> 26:45.756
Ramy Essam, the singer.

26:45.800 --> 26:47.314
Do you know Ramy Essam?

26:47.800 --> 26:51.077
They arrest people and
take them to the museum.

26:51.440 --> 26:53.750
Be sure of it
before you spread the word.

26:54.560 --> 26:55.880
Ramy was taken?

26:55.960 --> 26:59.271
He got arrested.
A lot of people got arrested.

26:59.440 --> 27:01.397
They will fuck him up.

27:28.440 --> 27:30.636
How can they fucking do this?

27:58.520 --> 28:02.275
They threw me to the ground
and took my clothes off.

28:02.680 --> 28:04.160
And they cut my hair.

28:04.240 --> 28:08.234
They beat me in lots of different ways.

28:08.360 --> 28:11.797
We have seen terrible injustice from them.

28:12.240 --> 28:19.511
This is from electrocution.
The blood freezes and clogs.

28:19.680 --> 28:24.038
Every two weeks, the Secret Police
used to come and take me away.

28:24.440 --> 28:29.515
I didn't know if I would ever return.
Many of my friends died inside.

28:29.680 --> 28:31.797
They used to come in
the middle of the night.

28:31.840 --> 28:34.275
They used to take you away violently.

28:34.480 --> 28:39.157
You were afraid to dream the wrong dream
for fear of punishment.

28:39.760 --> 28:42.719
They used to search his computer

28:42.760 --> 28:49.951
Looking for anything religious or Islamic.

28:50.280 --> 28:53.318
They used to come, and
no one could say a word.

28:54.240 --> 28:56.596
He was electrocuted and beaten.

30:07.080 --> 30:09.311
The battle isn't just the rocks and stones

30:09.640 --> 30:11.233
The battle is in the images

30:11.280 --> 30:13.556
The battle is in the stories.

30:23.440 --> 30:29.755
We decided to create
a space which supports

30:30.160 --> 30:34.632
Those fighting for the revolution

30:34.680 --> 30:37.878
Through video and various
types of media.

30:37.960 --> 30:40.634
It's what's called "Popular Media"

30:40.880 --> 30:43.634
Using web sites like YouTube.

30:44.000 --> 30:48.119
If you know anyone who
has a digital camera

30:48.160 --> 30:50.391
They're not using, tell us.

30:50.760 --> 30:53.594
We should film as much as we can.

30:53.840 --> 30:56.674
The truth is that things
are moving quickly.

30:56.840 --> 30:59.878
We don't know when this footage
can be used as evidence.

31:01.920 --> 31:05.755
If people are being fooled about
what is really happening here,

31:05.800 --> 31:08.440
We must film everything
and show them the truth.

31:08.960 --> 31:12.749
As long as there's a camera,
the revolution will continue.

31:13.640 --> 31:17.270
The problem now with the media

31:17.320 --> 31:20.233
Is that they oppose change

31:20.280 --> 31:23.512
And turn people against the revolution.

31:23.600 --> 31:25.910
So what will you do?

31:26.200 --> 31:29.876
Well, I am going
to keep exposing them.

31:29.960 --> 31:31.792
And they'll keep
exposing themselves.

31:31.840 --> 31:33.718
Until

31:34.280 --> 31:37.512
The corrupt media falls.

31:38.440 --> 31:41.194
What are you going to do?
Start a television station?

31:41.240 --> 31:43.755
Yes, hopefully I will.

31:43.840 --> 31:47.516
Well you'll have to put it in Cyprus
or else they will destroy it.

31:47.920 --> 31:50.435
So you'll need
a massive amount of money.

31:50.920 --> 31:52.240
Yours

31:52.520 --> 31:55.479
Because your people are poor.

31:55.680 --> 32:00.550
And who is this democracy
and freedom for?

32:01.640 --> 32:04.280
The poor and under privileged.

32:04.360 --> 32:07.831
The rich don't want freedom.
They're already free.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.639
Revolution means total change.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.600
A government
accountable to the people.

32:12.635 --> 32:13.590
Be patient.

32:13.640 --> 32:16.109
Patient for how long?

32:17.200 --> 32:19.874
This is what I thought would
happen when we left the Square

32:19.920 --> 32:21.673
After Mubarak stepped down,

32:21.840 --> 32:23.360
We would run the government

32:23.395 --> 32:24.635
And run the Army.

32:24.680 --> 32:27.752
Look, our biggest mistake
was leaving the Square.

32:27.920 --> 32:30.640
We're like someone who
did really well in an exam

32:30.800 --> 32:33.235
And then forgot to write their
name on the exam.

32:33.360 --> 32:35.875
So you have no idea
who it belongs to.

32:45.920 --> 32:49.937
WE YOUR EGYPTIAN ARMED FORCES HAVE
NOTHING BUT LOVE AND APPRECIATION

32:50.120 --> 32:53.955
FOR EGYPT'S BELOVED PEOPLE AND ITS
INNOCENT MARTYRS OF THE REVOLUTION

32:57.320 --> 33:00.518
We have nothing against
nature, grass, or beauty

33:00.720 --> 33:02.757
But this is not our Square.

33:02.920 --> 33:04.640
This is the Square they're
using to manipulate us

33:04.675 --> 33:05.885
In order for them to say

33:05.920 --> 33:07.720
"We cleaned up the Square for you. "

33:07.755 --> 33:09.735
"And beautified it for you"

33:09.770 --> 33:11.715
"And did all what you wanted. "

33:12.200 --> 33:13.953
Why do you want to ruin
what they did?

33:14.080 --> 33:15.639
Move away.

33:18.280 --> 33:21.352
They are trying to
divide us and distract us.

33:22.720 --> 33:26.031
Egypt, mother of the world,
my country

33:26.760 --> 33:29.480
Where laughter and singing comes

33:30.080 --> 33:34.393
Purely from the heart.

33:48.840 --> 33:52.117
Six months have passed since
the day we started the revolution

33:52.640 --> 33:56.350
The Armed Forces said they would
hand over power in six months.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.353
But what have they done instead?

33:58.760 --> 34:01.355
They started arresting us day after day.

34:01.880 --> 34:04.475
Sent thousands of revolutionaries
to military trials.

34:04.560 --> 34:05.994
There is no new constitution.

34:06.400 --> 34:09.677
There is no law.
Nothing to protect us.

34:10.719 --> 34:14.396
So we defied Army orders
and took back our Square.

34:35.080 --> 34:36.958
<i>Wake up</i>

34:37.080 --> 34:38.639
<i>Cicil</i>

34:38.920 --> 34:40.478
<i>Peaceful</i>

34:40.960 --> 34:42.518
<i>Popular</i>

34:43.080 --> 34:46.391
<i>Totally Free!</i>

34:51.560 --> 34:53.119
<i>Revolution</i>

34:53.600 --> 34:57.880
I'm Egyptian, and I'm
sitting-in once again in Tahrir

34:57.915 --> 34:59.439
Because I didn't feel any change.

34:59.640 --> 35:02.235
Why do they send the
revolutionaries to military trials

35:02.280 --> 35:06.160
While the corrupt old regime
is protected?

35:06.680 --> 35:08.399
The Square is what united us all.

35:08.880 --> 35:10.758
Even if we disagree with each other,

35:10.920 --> 35:13.151
We have to be united once again.

35:15.280 --> 35:18.956
I'm Ahmed Hassan, your friend,
sitting-in with you in Tahrir Square.

35:19.040 --> 35:23.592
During the early days, we agreed
to stay united no matter what.

35:23.680 --> 35:27.833
When we were united
we brought down the dictator.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.832
How do we succeed now?

35:29.920 --> 35:32.116
We succeed by uniting once again.

35:32.280 --> 35:36.069
All political currents, the Brotherhood,
Muslims and Christians

35:36.160 --> 35:38.197
Any party,
we're all Egyptians.

35:38.280 --> 35:40.078
We have to go back to being united.

35:43.960 --> 35:46.873
God give you strength.

35:53.640 --> 35:57.680
THE PEOPLE WANT TO CLEANSE THE NATION

36:22.640 --> 36:25.075
- I missed you.
- I missed you a lot.

36:26.040 --> 36:27.713
- How are you?
- Good

36:28.360 --> 36:31.239
There's a massive turnout today.

36:35.920 --> 36:38.754
- But it's a different crowd today.
- Meaning?

36:38.880 --> 36:43.640
There's a big presence
of Muslim Brotherhood.

36:43.675 --> 36:45.279
- More than the last week?
- For sure.

36:45.320 --> 36:47.880
Yes, the Brotherhood wasn't here last week.

36:49.840 --> 36:54.278
All the Muslim Brothers
were told to be here today.

36:54.680 --> 37:02.520
It's been said that the Muslim
Brotherhood made a deal with the Army.

37:03.320 --> 37:05.118
This is what's being said.

37:05.440 --> 37:07.591
Honestly, I'm upset about their
political tactics and games.

37:07.640 --> 37:14.558
They should not be here
for a political agenda or gains.

37:15.320 --> 37:20.156
Some Brotherhood leaders make
secret deals with the Army

37:20.200 --> 37:27.277
And use their presence in the Square
as a negotiating tool.

37:27.320 --> 37:31.599
You know I think this is wrong.

37:33.320 --> 37:37.553
The Quran is
our constitution.

37:37.760 --> 37:41.197
Islamic rule!
Islamic rule!

37:42.360 --> 37:45.319
The Muslim Brotherhood
started yelling "Islamic rule, Islamic rule"

37:46.120 --> 37:49.909
What do they mean by Islamic?
Aren't we Muslims too?

37:50.280 --> 37:55.116
The Brotherhood began to use the Square
to negotiate with the Army.

37:56.160 --> 37:58.311
They're not calling
for the people's demands.

37:59.040 --> 38:01.635
But for their political demands.

38:02.840 --> 38:05.605
The Brotherhood ruined the sit-in.

38:05.640 --> 38:08.599
They've created divisions
amongst everyone in the Square.

38:09.720 --> 38:15.591
They are exhausting
everyone with their lies.

38:17.400 --> 38:18.277
Thank you

38:19.360 --> 38:22.159
- What are you going to eat?
- I have some.

38:23.080 --> 38:29.714
When the Brotherhood are active, people say
they are hijacking the revolution.

38:29.760 --> 38:31.717
But the Brotherhood existed
long before the revolution.

38:31.960 --> 38:35.431
But you change your statements
based on where you are.

38:35.480 --> 38:38.598
In Cairo, you say you a want secular state.

38:38.680 --> 38:41.559
In other areas you say
you want a religious one.

38:41.600 --> 38:45.674
You are the biggest supporters of the
Military Council, standing against us.

38:45.800 --> 38:48.599
You speak in the name of
religion to get what you want.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.752
You contradict your statements all the time.

38:51.480 --> 38:52.960
Hold on, look at this

38:53.440 --> 38:55.909
I'm very sorry that you
were beaten in the past.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.437
No, not beaten.
We've spent our lives in prison cells.

39:00.840 --> 39:03.150
The Muslim Brotherhood
has damaged the image of Islam.

39:03.240 --> 39:05.085
I am embarrassed of being
a Muslim because of you.

39:05.120 --> 39:09.399
The Brotherhood has hijacked the revolution,
turned people against us

39:09.720 --> 39:11.757
And the media blames the revolutionaries
for destroying the country!

39:12.000 --> 39:13.880
The people who died,
they died because of you,

39:13.915 --> 39:15.951
And your deals with the Military.

39:16.120 --> 39:18.480
Weren't the Brotherhood
with you in the Square?

39:18.515 --> 39:21.393
Yes, there were some who died
next to me

39:22.320 --> 39:24.880
But they were defying
Brotherhood orders.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.198
Sir, if you forget,
the Egyptian people do not.

39:28.280 --> 39:29.873
Don't try to hijack the revolution.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.045
Fine, fine, fine

39:31.080 --> 39:33.754
The entire Brotherhood is bullshit.

39:35.760 --> 39:39.197
Sir, can I ask you a question?

39:39.640 --> 39:41.154
Are the Brotherhood
leaving the Square?

39:41.200 --> 39:42.634
Yes, they're leaving at 5

39:43.080 --> 39:47.233
The Brotherhood refuse
to stay in the sit-in,

39:47.280 --> 39:50.273
Because you're calling
for a new constitution.

39:50.600 --> 39:51.829
Let's cut the bullshit.

39:52.600 --> 39:55.513
We made a revolution,
we demand a new constitution.

39:55.760 --> 39:58.070
Laws, elections, judiciary

39:58.360 --> 40:01.034
Everything stems from the constitution.

40:01.280 --> 40:08.039
Listen, the Brotherhood
will never make radical changes

40:08.600 --> 40:11.274
Never the radical change we want.

40:13.640 --> 40:16.997
I don't want to follow the
news of the sit-in anymore.

40:18.560 --> 40:21.439
I'm not supporting
this sit-in anymore.

40:21.480 --> 40:24.791
Especially when you say it's full of
Brotherhood and State Security.

40:25.200 --> 40:28.432
No, it's not full of them.

40:28.480 --> 40:32.110
But it's a place where it's easy
to manipulate things.

40:32.200 --> 40:34.840
It's obvious that our presence in
the Square pressures the Army.

40:35.480 --> 40:37.915
As long as you have a daily
commitment to the Square,

40:38.240 --> 40:39.879
You will keep going

40:40.200 --> 40:43.432
Until you get arrested.

40:46.200 --> 40:49.591
I'm not happy with
the leaders of the Brotherhood.

40:49.960 --> 40:51.599
I disagree
with their latest statements

40:51.640 --> 40:55.077
That we can't go to the Square
because it's hurting the economy

40:55.120 --> 40:59.273
And it could put the Brotherhood
in a bad position.

41:00.040 --> 41:04.592
When our leaders issue an order,
we don't argue

41:04.640 --> 41:08.600
Because we see them
as better judges.

41:08.880 --> 41:12.237
- They say...
- Don't talk about it?

41:12.280 --> 41:15.512
No, "You're there as an individual,
not as a Muslim Brother. "

41:15.800 --> 41:18.998
They repeat this
message at each meeting.

41:19.160 --> 41:21.356
Do you know what a 'civil state' is?

41:21.400 --> 41:25.314
A 'civil state' represents
all different parts of society.

41:25.440 --> 41:26.715
- Which mainly includes what?
- What?

41:26.760 --> 41:27.637
The Islamic religion.

41:27.760 --> 41:31.151
No matter what,
religion will always be there.

41:31.240 --> 41:32.640
But it should be official.

41:32.680 --> 41:34.956
Religion does not need to be on paper.

41:35.120 --> 41:37.032
Religion is in the heart,

41:37.120 --> 41:38.190
- And in the mind.
- It should also be on paper.

41:38.320 --> 41:40.277
Paper, what paper?

41:40.400 --> 41:43.154
You need a paper to
know you are Muslim?

41:50.880 --> 41:54.476
When the Brotherhood got what
they wanted from the Military,

41:55.200 --> 41:59.274
They left us alone in the Square,
to get beaten up, arrested

42:00.640 --> 42:02.871
To die alone.

42:23.360 --> 42:25.033
Why are you doing this?

42:28.600 --> 42:30.273
You motherfucker!

42:31.920 --> 42:33.593
Come back, come back!

42:33.960 --> 42:34.757
Asshole.

42:37.080 --> 42:38.355
Your permit.

42:39.080 --> 42:41.037
Your permit.

42:41.080 --> 42:43.117
Ok, where's your film?

42:43.320 --> 42:44.595
No, you did.

42:44.840 --> 42:46.559
Yeah, yeah.

42:46.640 --> 42:47.869
Your ID.

42:48.960 --> 42:49.996
Open the camera.

42:50.040 --> 42:51.474
Show me the camera.

42:52.080 --> 42:53.480
I want to see your ID.

42:53.880 --> 42:55.519
Don't step outside.

43:28.560 --> 43:31.871
Well, this is why we want to get
rid of them as soon as possible

43:31.960 --> 43:34.634
And to say that people
are not ready to vote

43:34.680 --> 43:37.639
Is just very condescending and wrong.

43:40.160 --> 43:43.551
Yeah, I know you don't agree.

43:48.400 --> 43:50.517
You want Parliamentary
elections in two months?

43:50.560 --> 43:52.711
Yes, I want people to vote.

43:52.760 --> 43:53.398
In two months?

43:53.440 --> 43:54.920
Yes, yes.

43:57.600 --> 43:58.716
Okay, so what?

44:05.080 --> 44:08.232
Yet, people are complaining that
the Muslim Brotherhood will win.

44:08.280 --> 44:09.157
Fuck this.

44:33.600 --> 44:36.115
Between the ex-regime as a major power force

44:36.160 --> 44:37.799
And the Brotherhood as a major power force

44:46.800 --> 44:49.269
I believe that the millions
who made this happen,

44:49.320 --> 44:51.357
I believe that the majority
of them were not people

44:51.400 --> 44:52.629
Who wanted the old regime

44:52.680 --> 44:54.797
And were not people who
wanted the Brotherhood.

44:54.920 --> 45:02.714
I am so fucking scared of the moment,
a lieutenant or a brigadier general

45:33.440 --> 45:37.434
Enough of this.
All the politicians are failures.

45:38.800 --> 45:42.237
The Muslim Brothers, the Salafis,
the Socialists,

45:42.280 --> 45:45.591
The Liberals, they're all failures.

45:49.480 --> 45:51.756
I've decided to walk in
the middle of the street.

45:52.880 --> 45:55.270
The cars can do whatever they want.

45:55.840 --> 45:57.832
What can they do?
Run me over?

45:57.920 --> 46:00.037
They need to curb to the side,
not me.

46:00.320 --> 46:03.199
I will stand my ground.

46:03.720 --> 46:04.995
Go away.

46:05.200 --> 46:07.396
Enough walking cautiously
on the side.

46:19.520 --> 46:22.399
After ten months,
everything was against us.

46:24.240 --> 46:26.357
The Military Council was against us.

46:26.680 --> 46:28.353
The Brotherhood sold us out.

46:28.680 --> 46:31.115
The media made people hate us.

46:31.920 --> 46:34.640
So much so that a peaceful protest

46:34.720 --> 46:37.189
In front of the State Media building

46:38.120 --> 46:40.157
Could go so wrong.

46:41.520 --> 46:44.877
I never imagined this could happen.

48:12.800 --> 48:16.635
Why do these people want to enter
the state television building?

48:17.360 --> 48:22.071
Imagine if someone went in and
announced themselves President

48:22.480 --> 48:24.039
Hell could break out.

48:24.880 --> 48:25.313
Alright?

48:25.360 --> 48:27.238
Those soldiers were on duty.

48:27.480 --> 48:28.516
Right?

48:28.640 --> 48:30.711
A soldier on duty,
what is he supposed to do?

48:31.080 --> 48:33.151
Who started attacking first?

48:33.400 --> 48:34.880
That's the question.

48:51.960 --> 48:56.830
Please accept my condolences.

48:56.880 --> 48:59.236
Don't cry.
Your son is in heaven.

48:59.440 --> 49:01.238
We'll continue his fight.

49:01.680 --> 49:04.991
We used to sit together in the Square.

49:05.200 --> 49:07.317
He used to sing,
"Christians and Muslims are one. "

49:07.600 --> 49:09.671
Nothing can ever separate us.

49:10.040 --> 49:13.112
Thousands will fight for his rights.

49:13.240 --> 49:15.596
Mina is in Heaven.

49:16.200 --> 49:18.032
Our voices must be heard.

49:18.280 --> 49:21.830
All bodies must be examined
and evidence must be kept!

49:22.040 --> 49:28.276
<i>We want our autopsy reports!</i>

49:33.760 --> 49:41.190
The hospital doesn't want to
stamp the autopsy reports.

49:43.080 --> 49:47.916
We discovered that the Secret Police
infiltrated the hospital

49:47.960 --> 49:50.919
Trying to convince the families
not to do autopsies.

49:51.360 --> 49:54.637
We managed to kick them out

49:54.720 --> 49:55.995
And the prosecutors left with them.

49:56.040 --> 49:58.077
Now we're waiting for the
families to make a decision.

49:58.120 --> 50:00.430
Whether they do the autopsies
or bury the bodies immediately.

50:00.880 --> 50:03.475
Without the autopsy evidence,
there'll be a big problem.

50:03.520 --> 50:06.877
They'll be able to say
"Oh, they died in a stampede. "

50:07.160 --> 50:09.391
They have to do autopsies.
They have to be filmed.

50:09.600 --> 50:13.799
Because there are clear marks
that they were run over by tanks.

50:14.280 --> 50:16.431
They summarized all you wrote

50:17.040 --> 50:19.640
And said he died from
a bullet in the chest.

50:19.675 --> 50:22.553
Stay here.
I'll get you the report.

50:31.880 --> 50:33.394
For a year we've been
in this mess.

50:33.600 --> 50:35.114
In this shit, in this country

50:35.160 --> 50:37.994
Because of every time
we keep silent.

50:38.120 --> 50:39.349
We can't stay silent.

50:39.400 --> 50:41.119
We have to keep the
pressure on.

50:41.240 --> 50:43.152
We might not win this time,
but maybe next time.

50:43.280 --> 50:45.840
People must know they will be punished

50:45.920 --> 50:47.877
And be afraid of that.

50:48.440 --> 50:50.591
People can't take it anymore.

50:50.640 --> 50:53.075
They're losing their nerves.

50:53.920 --> 50:57.118
The Egyptian regime was able
to fool both Muslims and Christians.

50:57.760 --> 51:02.073
They want to suffocate us.

51:02.760 --> 51:04.399
If it remains stuck in our minds

51:04.440 --> 51:07.717
That it's a sectarian problem,
that will be a crisis.

51:07.800 --> 51:09.792
The Army wants this to happen.

51:11.280 --> 51:13.511
There is an old saying:

51:13.760 --> 51:15.125
- "Divide and Conquer"
- Exactly.

51:15.160 --> 51:18.392
They want to divide Muslims and Christians.

51:23.200 --> 51:27.433
Why Mina? Didn't I tell you
not to go to protests?

51:27.520 --> 51:30.752
"I won't go.
I'll do as you say, Mom. "

51:30.880 --> 51:32.917
But you tricked me and went

51:33.040 --> 51:35.236
And took your life away from me.

51:35.920 --> 51:38.799
"If I died a martyr, Mom?
Would you be sad for me, Mom?"

51:39.440 --> 51:43.195
I'm not sad for the martyr in you.
But losing you hurts, my love.

51:43.520 --> 51:47.116
I'm not sad
for the martyr in you, my love.

51:48.120 --> 51:50.430
I'm not sad
for the martyr in you, my love.

51:55.080 --> 51:57.390
Our parting hurts, Mina.

52:56.960 --> 52:58.679
<i>Our Army is firing at us!</i>

52:58.840 --> 53:01.071
<i>A new revolution all ocer again!</i>

53:01.240 --> 53:02.959
<i>Live free or die heroes!</i>

53:04.040 --> 53:05.599
Our Army has protected you!

53:05.800 --> 53:07.678
And protected the revolution!

53:07.960 --> 53:09.076
The Army didn't protect
the revolution.

53:09.200 --> 53:10.475
The Army protected
their interests

53:10.560 --> 53:12.199
But betrayed the revolution!

53:12.360 --> 53:13.077
Betrayed the revolution!

53:13.240 --> 53:13.718
Protected the revolution!

53:13.800 --> 53:14.631
Betrayed the revolution!

53:14.760 --> 53:16.707
Betrayed the revolution!

53:16.800 --> 53:18.154
The Army betrayed the revolution!

53:18.200 --> 53:19.793
So you are right?
And all of us are wrong?

53:22.040 --> 53:23.679
Betrayed the revolution!

53:29.760 --> 53:32.753
It's shocking that however
many people died yesterday

53:32.960 --> 53:35.600
The whole country isn't in outrage.

53:36.160 --> 53:39.756
Is there still a possibility for enough
people to be convinced

53:40.320 --> 53:44.519
That action en masse can change the
future of the country.

53:45.520 --> 53:47.989
And if people are stopping to
believe that, then

53:48.240 --> 53:50.391
As a revolution we're in trouble.

53:50.560 --> 53:51.357
<i>Freedom!</i>

53:51.480 --> 53:52.880
<i>Freedom!</i>

53:53.000 --> 53:54.354
<i>Freedom!</i>

53:54.480 --> 53:55.880
<i>Freedom!</i>

53:56.000 --> 53:56.592
<i>Freedom!</i>

54:14.560 --> 54:17.280
<i>When you're working hard</i>

54:17.400 --> 54:19.676
<i>And worried about your
country's future</i>

54:19.800 --> 54:22.235
<i>When all your work
is for nothing</i>

54:22.400 --> 54:25.518
<i>Because only the corrupt
get ahead</i>

54:25.680 --> 54:27.990
<i>Bow, bow,
bow your head down</i>

54:28.120 --> 54:30.396
<i>Because your country is a "democracy"</i>

54:30.480 --> 54:32.836
<i>When freedom of expression
is a crime</i>

54:33.000 --> 54:35.276
<i>When you have to hide
your beliefs in your heart</i>

54:35.440 --> 54:37.511
<i>When I can see shame
in your eyes</i>

54:37.720 --> 54:40.155
<i>Then join your pain with mine</i>

54:40.400 --> 54:42.312
<i>Bow, bow,
bow your head down</i>

54:42.680 --> 54:44.592
<i>Because your country is a "democracy"</i>

54:44.680 --> 54:47.070
<i>When the Army
is your "protector"</i>

54:47.240 --> 54:49.471
<i>While turning its back on the country</i>

54:49.600 --> 54:51.717
<i>Abusing their powers</i>

54:51.840 --> 54:54.355
<i>Hiding safely
behind their uniform</i>

54:54.480 --> 54:56.597
<i>Bow, bow,
bow your head down</i>

54:56.840 --> 54:59.833
<i>Because your country is a "democracy"</i>

55:06.080 --> 55:09.039
<i>The people want the fall
of the Military regime</i>

55:09.360 --> 55:11.875
<i>The people want the fall
of the Military regime</i>

55:12.320 --> 55:14.835
<i>The people want the fall
of the Military regime</i>

55:25.000 --> 55:27.469
Khalid!
Get in the car.

55:57.280 --> 55:59.840
<i>Stand back. Stand back.</i>

56:16.200 --> 56:18.954
The Square was tough.

56:20.760 --> 56:23.229
The Square was not normal.

56:41.840 --> 56:45.038
No one could understand
what was happening.

56:47.200 --> 56:49.078
It was a war.

56:49.120 --> 56:51.396
A war in the Square.

56:51.480 --> 56:53.153
Not a revolution.

56:53.200 --> 56:54.839
It was not a revolution.

57:16.560 --> 57:19.871
<i>The people demand the fall
of the Military regime.</i>

57:24.360 --> 57:27.717
They were firing live bullets at us.

57:34.600 --> 57:39.356
Firing randomly in every
corner of the Square.

57:52.000 --> 57:55.118
People were falling one by one

57:57.120 --> 58:01.512
Just because they were saying
"Down with Military rule. "

58:12.040 --> 58:13.440
Revolutionaries

58:17.760 --> 58:24.109
The good and free people
are being called traitors

58:25.040 --> 58:29.273
While the traitors are called heroes.

58:50.400 --> 58:53.950
It was too much.
Too many bullets.

59:05.200 --> 59:07.840
Our Army is killing us.

59:08.080 --> 59:09.673
They can't be Egyptians!

59:10.400 --> 59:13.040
They forgot Egypt!

59:18.760 --> 59:22.276
He's alive, he's alive

59:28.000 --> 59:30.720
Death always knocks on my door

59:31.560 --> 59:33.438
Knocking on my head.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.236
The Brotherhood just called me.

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:43.079
They said "Don't go to the Square. "

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:46.912
I told them "No one is going
to stop me from following my conscience"

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:50.717
It is your right to banish me from
your group, from your party.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.912
Banish me and my whole family,

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:55.676
But they have no authority over me.

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:57.114
The issue is over.

01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:59.078
They know Magdy is always in the Square.

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:02.352
Magdy the revolutionary?
Not Magdy the Muslim Brother?

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.119
Yes, the revolutionary.

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:10.555
I want to tell the Brotherhood
that the protestors who are sacrificing now

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:14.310
Are the only reason
they have any voice in this country.

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.354
Elections or not, our revolution
is still not over.

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:19.477
Nothing has been accomplished yet.

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:19.151
There's only so much you can handle.
We're human after all.

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:30.194
There's only so much
you can see.

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:35.233
At some point I'm going to explode.

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:37.791
At some point, I'm going to explode.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.473
Watch out, watch out!

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:09.150
Are you ok?

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:11.319
Hey kiddo,
are you ok?

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.120
Ahmed! Ahmed!

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:26.072
Let me pass, let me pass

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:35.115
Is it a bullet?

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:36.077
A bullet?

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:39.829
Is it a bullet?

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.553
Or a rock?

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.434
Can I have some bandages?

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:46.675
Bandages, bandages

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:49.478
Why is there all this blood?

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:51.591
Why all this blood?

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:09.395
They're gassing the hospital
and people are dying.

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:13.679
Even the doctors are dying.

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:18.357
I think it's nerve gas.
You collapse and convulse.

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:20.197
Did you film any of this?

01:05:20.232 --> 01:05:21.995
I filmed but then I fell.

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:23.673
You couldn't take it?

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:28.237
I was shaking and suffocating.
Everyone was.

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:31.080
The patients have to be moved,
or they will die.

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:50.875
General Tantawi denied that
any live bullets have been fired.

01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:53.872
Glorious people of Egypt.

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:57.716
What we are witnessing
now on the streets and television

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:03.235
Are just accusations attempting
to smear the image of the Military.

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:10.916
The Armed Forces will move forward
with Parliamentary elections as planned.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:16.519
Presidential elections will take place
before the end of June 2012.

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:20.271
It's the first time he dares speak to us!

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:06.711
Hi Ahmed

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.957
How did you know it was me?

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:11.191
Of course honey, you're my sweetheart.

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.312
So quickly you said "Hello Ahmed. "

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:16.839
How are you doing?

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:21.789
I'm fine, thank God.

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:23.474
I prepared dinner for you.

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:24.840
Thank you.

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:29.080
I'll come home now.

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:30.236
Okay

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:31.436
Good-bye

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:39.192
I can't tell my mother I'm injured.

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:41.676
It will make her worry.

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:06.313
And while we were dying in the street

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:13.550
The Brotherhood had already
made a deal with the Military.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.712
They won the Parliamentary elections

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:21.231
And started preparing
for Presidential elections.

01:08:47.399 --> 01:08:49.437
The Brotherhood are here to celebrate

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:51.596
And we're here to continue the revolution.

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:54.430
<i>"We're preparing, in God's name"</i>

01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:57.799
<i>"To fight the final battle"</i>

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:02.115
The Muslim Brotherhood buys
poor people with oil and sugar.

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:06.314
They mobilize people using religion.

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:09.990
We've accomplished huge gains.

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:14.314
It's a big leap forward that
we've taken Parliament.

01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:18.037
This is the will of the people,
the will of the nation.

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:24.237
The Brotherhood made this revolution.

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:28.430
Listen Sir, this was never about the
Brotherhood or the Islamists.

01:09:28.479 --> 01:09:30.995
This revolution was made by
everyday people taking to the streets

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:34.238
And the Brotherhood was not
there at the beginning.

01:09:34.279 --> 01:09:35.872
I'm tired of arguing about this.

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:38.839
The problem is that
we don't tolerate each other.

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:41.037
You left us to die in order
to take Parliament.

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:44.312
All the people who died
were because of your betrayals.

01:09:44.399 --> 01:09:45.390
The Muslim Brotherhood

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:48.319
You shook hands with
the Military and betrayed us.

01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:49.925
- Just like this.
- So what?

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:51.439
- It's our right.
- It's your right!

01:09:51.479 --> 01:09:52.755
I will not respond to this.

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:53.995
It's our right.

01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:56.635
The Brotherhood has the right
to ally itself with the Military?

01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:58.598
The same Military
that killed its own people?

01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:02.196
Talk some sense into
your Brotherhood friend.

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:06.672
He's saying the Brotherhood
must cooperate with the Military.

01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:10.438
Talk some sense into him.

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:13.120
You can have the Square
and do whatever you want

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:17.240
The revolution is coming
no matter what.

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:29.959
What do you think?

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:35.552
They've come to dance.

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:37.475
Who is dancing?

01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:39.871
I understand what Ahmed is saying.

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:43.719
Some are dancing

01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:45.752
While some are getting screwed.

01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:49.630
And we've been destined to
be the ones getting screwed.

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:54.278
The revolution in two words?

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:57.472
A revolution
that removed a regime, ok?

01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:00.554
Before the people destroyed it.

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:02.917
Did the Army
protect the revolution?

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.233
We didn't protect the revolution,
we made it happen.

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:09.590
You kids
don't know anything.

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.671
I was beaten with boots and sticks.

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:16.872
I'm bruised from being
beaten all over my body.

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:19.600
I've lived in the military
world for 40 years.

01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:21.552
I am honestly telling you

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:24.069
The Armed Forces are not like this.

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:25.276
At all

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:29.513
You've been entrusted with a
nation's security. It's your duty.

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:31.439
So, all I'm asking is

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:35.036
How can I entrust a nation to
those who can't even protect a woman?

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:37.113
Even if I am your brother

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:39.072
At some point, I must be tough on you.

01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:42.199
I don't understand why.

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:43.158
Why?

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:47.520
When the Army first came to the streets
people climbed on tanks

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:49.398
And hugged the soldiers
and clapped for them.

01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:50.954
What then? Why?

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.269
What's wrong with you?

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:57.876
I swear to you Ghada, one day you'll say
you met General Hamdy Bekheit

01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:59.752
And he told you the following

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:02.840
None of the guilty will get away with it.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.480
Whatever happens.

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:06.552
I promise you.

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:10.951
This is a picture of a friend
who took a bullet in his leg.

01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:14.113
This is not an Army bullet.

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.913
It doesn't look like one.

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:21.274
The most beautiful thing about our Square

01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:24.474
Is that everyone who comes here
follows his conscience,

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:27.396
Not some political force.

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:29.910
And that's what makes us strong.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.957
We're here presenting Cinema Tahrir

01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:34.594
To remind us why we are here

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.152
And to show the people who ask us
why we're still here.

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:43.236
Because only we can tell our stories.

01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:05.392
The revolutionaries who toppled the regime

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:09.429
Have died, been injured, or gone to prison.

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:12.597
And with no constitution,

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:16.357
They want to hold elections
stained by revolutionary blood.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.879
Supervised by those
who killed the revolutionaries.

01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:22.399
And they made two ballot boxes

01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:26.956
One for the killer,
and one for the traitor.

01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:31.397
Our voices will keep
getting higher and higher,

01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:34.759
Because the streets are our ballot boxes.

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:04.477
I don't want either.

01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:08.674
We're stuck between
a rock and a hard place.

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:12.235
We'll have to accept
whatever happens.

01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:17.036
Everyone keep your voices down.

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:21.716
With 51.73%

01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:26.477
13 million, 230 thousand and 131

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:28.274
Listen up

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:33.193
The winner of the Egyptian
Presidential elections

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:37.194
Is Dr. Mohamed Morsi

01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:39.079
<i>Morsi!</i>

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:58.238
Some people are afraid,
but they should give Morsi a chance.

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:01.634
If I were the president, I'd tell the people
to give us one chance.

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:05.436
If Morsi isn't able to prove himself,
he should leave power.

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:07.520
Just give him 100 days.

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:10.155
We waited 30 years for this.

01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:14.440
Give him 100 days.
It's still your revolution.

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:27.071
It was the worst day of my life

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:29.958
The day the Muslim Brotherhood took over.

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:32.669
They were the first ones to betray us.

01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:34.952
And now they're ruling the country.

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:37.555
They were the only unified
group in the Square.

01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:39.353
They have a leader telling them what to do.

01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:40.914
They are highly organized.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.037
Our main problem as revolutionaries

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:46.392
Most of the time, we
only object and say "No"

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:48.313
And we never suggest alternatives.

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:50.278
Politics is not the same as a revolution.

01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:54.320
If you want to play politics,
you have to compromise.

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:57.436
And we're not good at this, at all.

01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:59.870
- We're terrible at it.
- We don't know how to compromise.

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:01.880
We're not organized.

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:04.799
Even strategically, it was obvious
who the real players are

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:10.080
It was either the old regime,
or the Brotherhood.

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:12.835
The Brotherhood wanted Parliament,
and they took it.

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:15.236
They wanted the upper house,
and they took it.

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:17.352
Now they took the presidency.

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:19.079
- What else is left?
- Nothing.

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:20.554
Then this is the end of the Brotherhood.

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:22.512
How so?
That's ridiculous.

01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:25.360
They're controlling everything now.

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:28.160
How can you say we will
topple the Brotherhood?

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:31.159
The more they control,
the more people will hate them.

01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:33.871
The street is our only way.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.950
After 150 days of Muslim Brotherhood rule,

01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:51.477
We found that Mohamed Morsi, who had
promised to achieve the revolution's demands,

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:57.590
Was bowing to the demands
of the Brotherhood Supreme Leader.

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:01.472
He tailored the constitution
to the Muslim Brotherhood

01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:06.197
And gave himself privileges
that even Mubarak didn't have.

01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:08.913
Mohamed Morsi is not a God.

01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:14.591
Mohamed Morsi is an Egyptian
who was elected by 51% of the vote.

01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:21.599
Morsi and the Brotherhood abused democracy.

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:39.555
The Brotherhood creature

01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:41.677
Has no place in the Square.

01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:43.991
We made this revolution.

01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:46.430
Why is he hijacking this Square?

01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:49.752
If we see a Muslim Brother
coming to the Square

01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:57.709
This idea of a ruling Pharaoh
still controlling us

01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:59.513
Needs to be broken.

01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:01.632
The Brotherhood stole the revolution

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:07.235
During these past months of Morsi's rule,

01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:09.710
We have the same problems.

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:12.872
It's crazy, we made a revolution
and no new constitution.

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:16.791
We got a president without a constitution.

01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:20.040
The most important thing
is the new constitution

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:22.276
And now it's under their control.

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:26.354
Religion is the biggest problem
we will face in this next phase

01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:30.356
Because we have a new political power

01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:33.154
That also claims it's a religious organization,

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:35.238
A missionary force,

01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:36.709
And this is a disaster.

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:41.593
Magdy, I love you.

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:43.832
But I hate the Brotherhood.

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:47.477
They made shitty decisions,
and we're in a shitty situation.

01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:51.157
You elected a president.
You need to be patient.

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:53.192
For how long?

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:57.513
The President is a man who
I trust with my religion.

01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:01.196
Can't I trust him with
my politics too?

01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:05.439
This is the constitution
of the Brotherhood.

01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:08.598
We are Egyptian citizens.

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:11.275
We are not Brotherhood citizens.

01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:16.992
You were against torture,
and now you're torturing.

01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:20.039
Against corruption,
and now you're corrupt.

01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:21.799
Who brought Morsi into power?

01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:23.383
The people.

01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:27.190
Because they felt you
guys were an oppressed people.

01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:31.317
This document will allow what happened to you
to happen to me. Do you accept that?

01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:31.952
Of course not.

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:36.080
OK, then take this constitution.
It doesn't serve me.

01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:39.790
I hated what they did to you.
I went to the streets because of it.

01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:42.315
Why did we go to the street?

01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:44.352
Wasn't it to protest against Police brutality?

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:49.156
The Secret Police that tortured you?

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:55.596
You are allowing the Secret Police
to do the same thing to me.

01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:59.515
And you're saying "yes" to this.

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:08.273
<i>The people demand
the fall of the regime.</i>

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:20.631
This is the third stage of our revolution.
We got rid of Mubarak, then the Military

01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:22.637
Now the focus is on the Brotherhood.

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:26.511
It is a bigger challenge,
because it will include more blood.

01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:30.958
When you're fighting your own people, it's
different from fighting the regime.

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:35.751
Because, after all, even if the regime was
extremely violent and vicious

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:38.878
And if they used all the weapons they had,

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:41.913
It's still not as vicious as when the people
fight each other. It's very different.

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:47.152
In the name of God,

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:49.916
I am directing this
to the people

01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:53.232
Who have resorted
to violence.

01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:56.677
The time has come
for the law

01:20:56.920 --> 01:21:02.200
To judge them
and punish them.

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:09.072
He's ordering his people to attack us.
That's the message behind his speech.

01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:11.797
Go to the streets
and attack the hell out of them.

01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:41.791
The Brotherhood has been
fucking with us for two years.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.117
You go to the toilet,

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:46.550
And they slip in 40 new articles
into the constitution.

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:48.000
It's crazy.

01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:55.552
What's happening here
is what happened in Iran.

01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:02.590
Soon enough, they will wipe us out,
and all their opposition.

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:06.912
Did you get orders to go to
the streets, or not?

01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:08.874
I was in the streets.

01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:09.876
You were there?

01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:11.320
- I went.
- You were involved in events?

01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:13.437
Yeah.
With some friends.

01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:15.318
During the fighting?

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:17.431
- Yes during the fight.
- At the Palace itself?

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:18.709
To remove the tents?

01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:21.072
You were throwing
rocks on me Assem?

01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:22.116
Throwing rocks at me.

01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:24.956
Come on.

01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:30.950
Let me show you this video.

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:35.357
<i>What happened is a crime against protestors</i>

01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:39.191
<i>Committed by the Muslim Brotherhood.</i>

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:43.276
<i>They tore their tents apart</i>

01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:46.552
<i>Why attack peaceful protestors?</i>

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:49.196
Oh God.

01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:55.751
<i>"We'll butcher you, if you don't
confess you're with the liberals"</i>

01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:04.393
- They used weapons?
- Yes

01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:10.032
How can a president bring his people to
attack protestors and destroy their sit-in?

01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:12.556
<i>Morsi, Morsi!</i>

01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:18.036
I was upset that
Assem went to the Palace.

01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:20.756
Who were you standing against?
Khalid?

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.150
Pierre?

01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:23.839
I was standing against them?

01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:25.599
What did you think?

01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:31.955
You know that one phone call from
the Brotherhood and we're all in the streets, right?

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.674
If they tell us to go to Tahrir
it's an order, right?

01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:41.831
I would never be proud of standing
with the Brotherhood to attack others.

01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:45.871
When this revolution started
I told you that it was for you.

01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:47.799
For your sister and brother.

01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:49.838
For you to write history.

01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:53.238
You have to stand
as an individual.

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:55.795
You can think for yourself.

01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:00.398
With all due respect
to you and the Brotherhood

01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:01.800
And other Islamists

01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:02.956
Or any other groups

01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:04.356
You have a brain.

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:06.359
You can think
for yourself.

01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:09.551
We have to ask ourselves
"Who created this situation?"

01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:11.359
Did the revolution create it?
No.

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:13.517
The person in charge
created this.

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:16.354
The dictator
who has given himself dictatorial powers.

01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:18.437
Who's ready to kill us

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:23.874
To force what he wants
and pass this constitution

01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:26.799
To have complete
and total power

01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:28.399
For eternity.

01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:19.834
I didn't see you today at all.

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:24.194
What did Morsi do wrong?

01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:26.797
No one has given him a chance.

01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:31.319
My butcher the other day yelled
"God Damn you, Morsi"

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:32.157
I asked why.

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:34.431
He said "Because it is so hot. "

01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:35.880
Is this a joke?

01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:38.350
If there were alternatives,
I wouldn't want Morsi

01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:42.878
Honestly, we don't care
about Mubarak or Morsi.

01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:46.470
We just want a decent
man to rule with justice.

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:48.233
I don't care if he's a Jew.

01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:56.831
We're afraid that if Morsi falls,
we will be taken back to prisons.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:01.040
Why all the focus on the Brotherhood
and how horrible the President is?

01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:06.673
The revolutionaries were your friends.
You lived with them.

01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:09.197
- There is a fog in the country.
- No, Magdy

01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:12.074
You abandoned one side and chose the other.

01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:14.272
I didn't abandon

01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:19.236
I chose the side that I grew up with,
that I felt was supporting me.

01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:24.999
Magdy has five children.
How does he provide for them?

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:28.151
The Muslim Brotherhood.

01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:33.600
All the time Magdy was playing revolutionary,
being filmed, shot at, jailed

01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:36.479
What did he gain?
Where did that get him?

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:40.676
I never thought we'd all be divided

01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:43.674
Into the Brotherhood and other groups.

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:46.071
I'm sad.
Nothing has changed for my dad.

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:47.839
We haven't gained
from the revolution.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.639
I still can't get
health care.

01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.638
It's okay.

01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:04.478
It's okay.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.913
These are the gains of the revolution

01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:14.153
She's filled with tears.

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:15.799
It's okay. Everything will be alright.

01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:45.311
Our beloved President

01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:50.834
May God make June 30th
a day of pride for Islam

01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:54.520
And a day of doom for the
hypocrite opposition.

01:27:54.555 --> 01:27:57.319
May you destroy them all.

01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:59.830
- Defeat them and make us win.
- Amen.

01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:01.678
- Protect us from their evils.
- Amen.

01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:06.199
President Morsi is a line you don't cross.

01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:07.725
Meaning?

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:11.071
Meaning, if you threaten him,
we'll spill your blood.

01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:12.965
Meaning?

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.834
Meaning, he's the legitimate elected President

01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:17.872
But they're going to the streets
to take him down.

01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:19.559
They can go to hell.

01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:20.910
Why? It's their right.

01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:22.872
No, It's not their right.

01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:24.798
<i>Freedom</i>

01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:26.909
<i>Freedom</i>

01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:38.040
What is revolution?

01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:41.552
Revolution is not simply replacing a regime.

01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:43.280
Revolution is a culture of a people.

01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:47.036
You give them
ownership of their freedom.

01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:48.911
That's what we gained.

01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:52.317
We were able to introduce the culture
of protesting.

01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:55.354
Now they can oppose the ruler whoever they are.

01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:58.874
If we predict what's next,
the Army is coming

01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:01.759
The Army will return,
let's not fool each other.

01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:05.112
But do you think the Army will act in
the same way it did?

01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:07.519
Do you think so?

01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:10.280
<i>Muslims and Christians
are one hand.</i>

01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:12.592
Now the power
is in the hands of the people.

01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:14.080
Whoever comes next

01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:17.837
The people will continue to pull
rulers out of power

01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:23.116
Until people reclaim their rights

01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:25.830
And we build the country ourselves.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:26.877
Isn't that right?

01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:31.599
<i>The people demand
the fall of the regime</i>

01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:34.839
<i>The people demand
the fall of the regime</i>

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:38.472
<i>The people demand
the fall of the regime</i>

01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:45.551
I told the Brotherhood once,
take the Square,

01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:47.115
Do what you want

01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:50.797
But the revolution is coming despite anyone.

01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:16.037
Millions and millions
of people took to the streets

01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:19.000
To tell him "Leave"

01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:21.918
Millions more than those
who protested against Mubarak,

01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:24.471
Protested against Morsi.

01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:27.352
This is the revolution's achievement.

01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:29.238
Because our revolution's weapon is our voice.

01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:31.352
For it to sound in every home.

01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:37.872
If you ask me
"What is the revolution's biggest victory?"

01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:43.714
It's that kids today play
a game called "Protest"

01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:46.237
Where some kids are
playing the revolutionaries,

01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:51.998
And others play Police or Army
or Muslim Brothers.

01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:58.800
<i>"The people demand
the fall of the regime"</i>

01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:05.354
<i>"The people demand
chocolate for kids"</i>

01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:10.637
Children of Egypt,

01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:13.115
People of Egypt everywhere,

01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:19.153
Standing in Egypt's squares and streets,

01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:25.590
If the price to protect my legitimacy
is my own blood,

01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:31.445
Then I'm ready to sacrifice it cheaply

01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:31.992
- Then I'm ready to sacrifice it cheaply
- Cheaply

01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:34.993
For the sake of this nation

01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:38.631
For God almighty.

01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:41.797
Morsi is digging his own grave with his words.

01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:43.399
I'm going down to the Square.

01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:46.275
I'm on my way.

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:53.639
Of course, there are weapons
in the Brotherhood sit-in.

01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:59.239
Aren't those in the Brotherhood
sit-in in grave danger?

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:02.957
We're not going to run away,
so some came with weapons.

01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:07.519
Some people think
"Kill those who are coming to kill you"

01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:11.035
I hope nothing bad happens.

01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:15.640
<i>Power</i>

01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:17.273
<i>Determination</i>

01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:19.073
<i>Faith</i>

01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:20.777
<i>Morsi, Morsi</i>

01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:22.435
<i>God is great</i>

01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:26.680
You don't want to see your friends,
Khalid and Ahmed?

01:32:26.715 --> 01:32:27.670
I want to see them,

01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:29.359
But I'm assigned here now.

01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:32.111
They told me I need to stay.

01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:35.434
I don't want to stand with
one side against the other,

01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:37.870
And it could result in death. Understand?

01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:39.520
Aren't you sad?

01:32:39.555 --> 01:32:40.192
Of course

01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:44.792
That your friends are on the opposite side?

01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:46.877
Who am I attacking?

01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:48.354
Am I going to attack Khalid Abdalla?

01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:52.076
Or Pierre who used to host me in his apartment?

01:32:52.640 --> 01:33:00.229
The President's speech was not
satisfactory to the people's demands.

01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:03.240
Early presidential elections will be held.

01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:10.438
The head of the constitutional
court will be the interim President

01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:13.555
Until a new president is elected.

01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:16.308
<i>Long live Egypt!</i>

01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:18.074
<i>Long live Egypt!</i>

01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:21.520
Morsi has fallen.

01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:23.353
So did the Army and Mubarak.

01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:26.396
We're waiting for the next one.

01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:30.635
This is our life now,
we'll stay in the street.

01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:32.674
I want to go home and sleep.

01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:57.713
So tell me Magdy,
what are we going to do now?

01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:00.634
Listen Ahmed, I swear to God,

01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:03.031
I'm at the Brotherhood sit-in.

01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:08.830
We may or may not be massacred.
It doesn't matter.

01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:12.075
If you're meant to die,
it's going to happen wherever you are.

01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:16.912
The more they kill,
the more we believe in our cause.

01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:26.713
The pro-Morsi sit-in declared
that there have been deaths

01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:34.236
After they were shot at with live bullets.

01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:39.716
A massacre by all means.

01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:46.631
Magdy, as much as I've been violent in words

01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:48.876
That was just anger speaking.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.550
Well, you're putting
our religion on the line.

01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:55.235
You're challenging our belief
of an Islamic country.

01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:58.672
Honestly, I want to come be with you.

01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:03.154
After all, this revolution was
for a principle, not for blood.

01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:07.791
What I feared has started happening

01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:11.071
That we're going to fight each other.

01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:13.096
<i>We're all your soldiers.
Morsi!</i>

01:35:13.131 --> 01:35:14.992
<i>We'll rally beside you.
Morsi!</i>

01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:16.719
<i>We'll rally beside you.
Morsi!</i>

01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:22.277
I don't want you to get hurt or killed.

01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:26.998
Magdy when I gave you a hard time
it was because I was mad.

01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:29.991
But we still respect each other's opinions.

01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:32.635
And you and I agree

01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:34.956
We want the best for our country.

01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:37.245
You shouldn't come here.

01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:40.990
- You shouldn't come here.
- No, forget it I'm coming.

01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:43.598
What will they do? Kill me?

01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:45.518
That's up to God's will.

01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:49.236
And if I die I'll just
blame it on you, Magdy.

01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:53.517
You know me.
I'm not here to die or to kill.

01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:56.597
You know my intentions.

01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:59.110
I swear, I know that Magdy

01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:00.873
May God stop the blood.
We've had enough.

01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:04.750
Please just take care of yourself, Magdy.

01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:08.793
May peace be with you.

01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:15.839
The leaders play on top, and the
people are on the bottom dying.

01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:20.358
The people pay the price for everything.
The people always pay the price.

01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:25.520
A Muslim Brother, a Salafi, a Revolutionary, a Secular,
a Christian or a Muslim, they're all Egyptians.

01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:27.319
Egyptians are paying the price.

01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:36.434
The toughest time of my life was

01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:41.273
When I was sleeping in my home
amongst my family

01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:43.599
And my children.

01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:47.589
I would open my eyes and find
Secret Police all around me

01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:48.916
Inside my bedroom.

01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:51.639
Is this a life?

01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:54.357
Is this a life?

01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:57.719
One day you'll call my son

01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:00.191
And my son might not answer you.

01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:04.236
His mother will tell you that Magdy is dead
and so is his son.

01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:06.358
Or put in jail.

01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:09.112
I would prefer death.

01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:10.514
Prison is hard.

01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:12.839
Very hard.

01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:18.870
I have aged, but it was trying
to achieve my dreams.

01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:23.278
We thought the revolution
had succeeded. Not really.

01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:25.712
It's not even close.

01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:32.039
We won't know if this
revolution has succeeded

01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:34.080
For decades.

01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:38.678
There is no way in which
the goals of this revolution:

01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:41.474
Bread, Freedom, Social Justice, Dignity

01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:44.280
There is no way in which those
things can be achieved

01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:46.155
In two years.

01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:50.309
What you can do is lay the ground
for them to actually happen.

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:54.840
Because when you don't have your rights,

01:37:54.875 --> 01:37:56.069
When you're taken for granted,

01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:58.720
When you're lied to, when you're killed

01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:03.792
Things become pretty clear.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:11.437
I think what's happening is more
powerful than any one individual

01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:13.199
and than any organization.

01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:19.118
It's something fundamental inside
people that is moving them.

01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:23.751
I don't know how you kill that.

01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:38.274
We're not looking for a leader as much
as we're looking for a conscience.

01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:40.990
What is a leader anyway?

01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:44.597
Are they going to offer
solutions from the heavens?

01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:47.316
They won't do that.

01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:52.760
The thing is, if we are able to create
this conscience within the society,

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.878
We'll be able to find a good president.

01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:03.231
We are not looking
for a leader to rule us.

01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:09.598
Because everyone who
went to Tahrir is a leader.

01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:14.199
We are looking for a conscience.

01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:03.925
<i>Freedom is coming, that's for sure</i>

01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:08.239
<i>"Liberty" was written in our destiny</i>

01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:21.192
<i>They said, riots are in our blood</i>

01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:23.755
<i>And how dare we claim our rights?</i>

01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:46.557
<i>Freedom</i>

01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:49.272
<i>Revolution!</i>

01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:08.237
Oh, the Square

01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:12.515
Where were you long ago?

01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:16.635
With you we sung and with you we suffered

01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:20.995
We've prayed and we've been scared

01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:25.716
United day and night

01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:29.675
Nothing is impossible with you

01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:33.916
The sound of freedom is gathering us

01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:38.156
And our lives finally have meaning

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.798
No turning back

01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:43.197
Our voices are finally heard

01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:47.349
And the dream is no longer
forbidden

01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:51.877
Oh, the Square

01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:55.837
Where were you long ago?

01:41:56.760 --> 01:42:00.549
You've destroyed the walls and let in the light

01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:04.749
You gathered the broken people around you

01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:09.514
We've been reborn

01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:13.317
And our determined dream was born

01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:17.840
We have our differences,
but our intentions are pure

01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:22.120
Even when the picture wasn't clear

01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:26.594
Honoring our country
and our grandchildren

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:31.671
And the rights that have been stolen
from our youth

01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:35.597
Oh, the Square

01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:39.430
Where were you long ago?

01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:43.953
With you we felt something for the first time

01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:48.240
But since then we grew apart

01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:52.440
We have to change ourselves
with our own hands

01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:56.840
You gave us so much, and now it's our turn

01:42:57.360 --> 01:43:01.400
Sometimes I fear that you become a memory

01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:05.960
We grow apart and the whole idea fades away

01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:10.400
That we forget everything that has happened

01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:14.800
And you become only a story to be told

01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:19.237
Oh, the Square

01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:23.515
Where were you long ago?

01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:27.990
Our idea is our strength

01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:32.310
Our unity is our weapon

01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:37.031
Oh, the square

01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:42.112
Where were you long ago?
