00:55.981 --> 00:59.115
why aren't you in bed?

00:59.117 --> 01:01.618
There's a zombie fight
on the sidewalk out there.

01:01.620 --> 01:04.788
Jared, you are too old
to be making up stories.

01:04.790 --> 01:07.023
I don't make up stories!

01:07.025 --> 01:09.526
The spider bite that rendered
you unable to do homework?

01:09.528 --> 01:11.161
I could've gone blind.

01:14.299 --> 01:16.666
They were out there.
I saw them.

01:16.668 --> 01:20.403
This is why we don't do
comic books before bed. Go.

affect the way i think.

02:13.125 --> 02:14.557
Or overthink.

02:14.559 --> 02:17.093
Well, it doesn't hurt to educate
myself on current treatments.

02:17.095 --> 02:20.497
On mental disorders
that you don't ha-- okay.

02:20.499 --> 02:22.298
You told me that you were
feeling better,

02:22.300 --> 02:23.867
That you had
no more symptoms.

02:23.869 --> 02:25.435
Yeah, but that can change
at any moment.

02:25.437 --> 02:26.903
And there's nothing i can
do about it.

02:26.905 --> 02:28.304
And i don't excel
at doing nothing.

02:28.306 --> 02:30.173
This is true.
So...Mm.

02:30.175 --> 02:32.809
hi, ma.

02:32.811 --> 02:35.145
Hi, girls.

02:35.147 --> 02:36.646
what's that?

02:36.648 --> 02:37.847
Nothing.

02:41.753 --> 02:43.820
What's that?
A backpack.

02:43.822 --> 02:45.822
What's it for?
Books.

02:45.824 --> 02:47.423
Are you taking a course?

02:47.425 --> 02:49.926
You could say that.
How nice!

02:49.928 --> 02:51.427
So what are you studying?

02:51.429 --> 02:53.296
Uh, bunch of subjects.

02:53.298 --> 02:56.232
You know, you could say
it's like a survey course.

02:56.234 --> 02:59.602
Hey, ang.
Hi, max.

02:59.604 --> 03:01.805
Who's that?
My study buddy.

03:01.807 --> 03:03.606
That's right.

03:03.608 --> 03:06.643
We're gonna nail the ged.
Right, ang?

03:07.979 --> 03:09.345
The ged?

03:09.347 --> 03:11.347
The high school equivalency
test?

03:13.318 --> 03:15.819
Max, would you mind
waiting in the courtyard for me,

03:15.821 --> 03:16.853
Just for a minute?

03:16.855 --> 03:18.354
I'll be right out.
Sure.

03:18.356 --> 03:19.722
Thanks.

03:25.630 --> 03:27.630
You never graduated high school?

03:27.632 --> 03:29.732
Nope.

03:29.734 --> 03:32.769
Your father thought it was
a waste of my time.

03:32.771 --> 03:35.705
Mom, i'm sorry.
I-i never knew that.

03:35.707 --> 03:40.043
Well, i don't go around
advertising it.

03:40.045 --> 03:43.713
It's kind of bothered me
since i never finished, so...

03:45.016 --> 03:47.050
Here i am.

03:47.052 --> 03:48.918
This is great!

03:48.920 --> 03:51.287
Ma! I'm so proud of you!

03:51.289 --> 03:52.856
Thanks.
Me, too.

03:52.858 --> 03:54.791
Oh, thank you, maura.

03:54.793 --> 03:56.159
When -- when's the exam?

03:56.161 --> 03:59.329
Uh, next month.
It's a 7 1/2 hour test,

03:59.331 --> 04:02.632
And max and i have been
cramming for it.

04:02.634 --> 04:05.401
Yeah, what's his story?
He's very bright.

04:05.403 --> 04:09.973
He, uh, dropped out to pursue
his passion for farming.

04:09.975 --> 04:11.975
In boston? What's he farm?

04:11.977 --> 04:14.644
Hydroponic marijuana, mostly.

04:14.646 --> 04:17.013
Gotta go!

04:19.551 --> 04:21.117
I got the top down
on my convertible.

04:21.119 --> 04:23.987
You okay with that?
Yeah, sure. Let's get to it.
Here.

04:23.989 --> 04:26.122
Cool pack.
Have fun, ma.

Remember, keep one foot
on the floor at all times!

04:56.922 --> 04:59.289
Yet another brilliant idea
from my father.

04:59.291 --> 05:01.824
How dare he talk her out of
getting a diploma?

05:01.826 --> 05:04.694
Thanks.
Well, i admire her courage.

05:04.696 --> 05:07.664
It can't be easy to dive back
into that coursework.

05:07.666 --> 05:10.133
And she has<i> max.</i>

05:10.135 --> 05:12.268
Well, at least he wants
to better himself.

05:12.270 --> 05:14.504
I smell pot on her,
she's grounded.

05:14.506 --> 05:17.173
It is legal here.
For medical use.

05:17.175 --> 05:19.442
My mother does not need
medical marijuana.

05:19.444 --> 05:22.178
She hallucinates when she takes
too many decongestants.

05:22.180 --> 05:24.113
Wow!

05:24.115 --> 05:25.982
Oh.

05:27.552 --> 05:29.252
Please tell me
that's not real.

05:31.122 --> 05:32.522
Hmm.

05:34.626 --> 05:37.393
Seems like some kind of
a synthetic polymer.

05:37.395 --> 05:38.661
Silicone, maybe.

05:38.663 --> 05:40.797
What about all the blood?

05:40.799 --> 05:42.565
Well,<i> that's</i> real.

05:42.567 --> 05:45.969
As is this tear
in the posterior skull tissue.

05:45.971 --> 05:48.604
Likely a result of blunt impact.

05:48.606 --> 05:50.974
He may have fractured
his occipital bone.

05:50.976 --> 05:52.575
Looks like they struggled
across the street

05:52.577 --> 05:55.745
And made their way over here,
where the victim went down.

05:55.747 --> 05:57.714
We know who he is?

05:57.716 --> 06:00.116
We're running prints
and facial recognition now.

06:00.118 --> 06:01.551
So no id?

06:01.553 --> 06:03.987
None that belonged to him,
but he had four wallets on him.

06:03.989 --> 06:05.121
He's wearing booster pants

06:05.123 --> 06:06.622
With all the hidden
compartments.

06:06.624 --> 06:08.257
Oh, he's a pickpocket.

06:08.259 --> 06:10.093
Maybe somebody he robbed
was on to him,

06:10.095 --> 06:11.327
Went after him for revenge.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.262
Pretty conspicuous look
for a thief.

06:13.264 --> 06:14.664
Maybe he was working
a costume party.

06:14.666 --> 06:16.366
Still...
Maybe he's really a zombie.

06:16.368 --> 06:18.334
Well, then we would have no case
because you can't kill a zombie.

06:18.336 --> 06:20.069
They're already dead.

06:20.071 --> 06:22.739
He's very talented.

06:22.741 --> 06:25.842
I mean, this laceration
on his cheek is a work of art.

06:25.844 --> 06:28.778
He even discolored
the subcutaneous tissue

06:28.780 --> 06:31.981
To account
for maggot infestation.

06:31.983 --> 06:33.182
Yay?

06:33.184 --> 06:35.418
Well, we have to admire
how real it looks.

06:35.420 --> 06:37.053
I mean, this takes dedication.

06:37.055 --> 06:38.187
There's a world record

06:38.189 --> 06:39.689
For the number of snails
on a person's face.

06:39.691 --> 06:41.024
That takes dedication, too,

06:41.026 --> 06:43.126
But it doesn't mean
i have to admire it.

06:43.128 --> 06:44.894
How many snails was it?

06:44.896 --> 06:46.963
That's not the point,
maura.

06:46.965 --> 06:47.997
43.

06:47.999 --> 06:50.133
I told her there was
zombies out there.

06:50.135 --> 06:52.135
Zombies? So more than one?

06:52.137 --> 06:55.838
Two. Fighting each other.
It was awesome.

06:55.840 --> 06:58.741
Until she had to interrupt.

06:58.743 --> 07:00.376
Can you describe
the second zombie?

07:00.378 --> 07:02.879
Uh, he was classic.
They both were.

07:02.881 --> 07:04.080
Meaning what?

07:04.082 --> 07:06.849
Meaning...They locomote
on two legs.

07:06.851 --> 07:08.184
As opposed to...

07:08.186 --> 07:10.119
Stalkers,
who move on all fours.

07:10.121 --> 07:12.989
Or crawlers.
They have no legs at all.

07:12.991 --> 07:15.925
Then you've got your bonies,
who generally don't move

07:15.927 --> 07:19.662
On account of their, uh...
Advanced decomposition.

07:19.664 --> 07:21.297
You know your zombies.

07:21.299 --> 07:23.332
Reanimation is my passion.

07:23.334 --> 07:26.069
Uh, was the other zombie
male or female?

07:26.071 --> 07:27.370
I don't know.

07:27.372 --> 07:29.439
Was there anything unique
about the second zombie?

07:29.441 --> 07:30.940
Did he have tattoos, glasses?

07:30.942 --> 07:32.442
No. Nothing like that.

07:32.444 --> 07:35.778
Okay, well, if he thinks of
anything else, give us a call.

07:35.780 --> 07:37.947
Okay. Thank you, detective.

07:37.949 --> 07:39.515
Come on.

07:39.517 --> 07:41.217
Look, i don't know if it was
a guy or a girl,

07:41.219 --> 07:44.187
But i'd recognize that zombie
if i saw it again.

07:44.189 --> 07:47.990
All right.
Come on.

Does it say
what the event was?
Yep.

07:53.965 --> 07:56.132
I have a feeling
he blended right in.

08:51.573 --> 08:54.273
Come on. Zombie children?
That's not cool.

08:54.275 --> 08:56.109
Hey, did you see
the zombie santa claus?

08:56.111 --> 08:58.878
Santa's not a zombie.
Well, he never seems to age.

08:58.880 --> 09:01.447
That's because he's filled with

How long does this go on?

09:07.856 --> 09:11.190
For the whole week.
We sell out every year.

09:11.192 --> 09:12.925
Have you noticed any, uh,
fights, arguments,

09:12.927 --> 09:14.527
Anything that would get
your attention?

09:14.529 --> 09:16.863
Nothing violent. But i checked
the theft report like you asked,

09:16.865 --> 09:19.332
And there have been some wallets
reported stolen.

09:19.334 --> 09:21.567
Seven, altogether.

09:23.071 --> 09:25.371
Uh...You recognize him?

09:27.642 --> 09:29.575
Who's he?
Kendall judd.

09:29.577 --> 09:31.110
We found him
a couple miles from here.

09:31.112 --> 09:32.879
Looked like he came
right from the convention.

09:32.881 --> 09:34.046
Well, it doesn't ring a bell,

09:34.048 --> 09:35.548
But i wouldn't recognize him
looking like that.

09:35.550 --> 09:37.483
What do you mean?
Well, the guy could be
my next door neighbor.

09:37.485 --> 09:39.752
I wouldn't recognize him
unless he's in a costume.

09:39.754 --> 09:41.888
And he's probably using
a zombie name.

09:41.890 --> 09:43.789
Like, for example,
my name is hank,

09:43.791 --> 09:45.658
But everybody calls me
"beaver."

09:45.660 --> 09:48.227
For the cleaver?
Right.

09:48.229 --> 09:50.296
That's clever.
Clever. Cleaver.

09:50.298 --> 09:51.931
Beaver.
Please stop.

09:51.933 --> 09:54.834
We need the names of anyone who
reported their wallet stolen.

09:54.836 --> 09:56.669
Sure thing.

09:56.671 --> 09:59.739
Yeah, everyone in costume.
Can't see who anybody really is?

09:59.741 --> 10:01.707
Mm, it's a good cover
for a thief.

[ mendelssohn's "wedding march"

are they getting married?

10:04.512 --> 10:06.479
Great cover.

10:06.481 --> 10:09.849
Zombie makeup's as good as
a ski mask for anonymity.

10:09.851 --> 10:11.184
I'll take the ski mask.

10:11.186 --> 10:13.052
What do you have
against zombies?

10:13.054 --> 10:14.387
I'm a homicide detective.

10:14.389 --> 10:17.256
I do not understand the appeal
of pretending to be dead.

10:17.258 --> 10:20.426
Oh, ho. Maybe frankie
can explain.

10:20.428 --> 10:21.627
Are you shopping?

10:21.629 --> 10:23.663
What? There was a sale
on blood capsules.

10:23.665 --> 10:25.164
Can we get out of here now,
please?

10:25.166 --> 10:28.935
Why? Are you scared?
No.

10:28.937 --> 10:31.804
This is "night of
the living dead" all over again.

for you, jane.

10:33.308 --> 10:34.941
No.
Yes.

10:34.943 --> 10:36.976
Jane, they're coming
for you.

10:36.978 --> 10:38.144
No.
Jane.

10:38.146 --> 10:40.680
Stop.
Jane.

10:49.524 --> 10:50.790
Oh, thanks, ma.

10:50.792 --> 10:52.458
Hey, how's the study group
going, angela?

10:52.460 --> 10:54.493
I'm quitting.
Why?

10:54.495 --> 10:57.363
We've been putting off
the math portion,

10:57.365 --> 11:00.566
And i realized why --
life is too short.

11:00.568 --> 11:02.001
Yeah, well,
you can't just quit.

11:02.003 --> 11:04.837
Well, i don't get it
no matter how many times i try.

11:04.839 --> 11:10.209
Anyway, when am i going to need
to do polynomial equations?

11:10.211 --> 11:14.046
I distinctly remember saying
the same thing to you

11:14.048 --> 11:15.481
When i was in the 10th grade.

11:15.483 --> 11:17.083
And if memory serves,

11:17.085 --> 11:20.353
You did not support
my wish to quit.

11:20.355 --> 11:22.421
That's different.
How so?

11:22.423 --> 11:24.156
I'm your mother.

11:24.158 --> 11:26.359
Ma. Come on!

11:26.361 --> 11:28.728
If you wanna pass the test,
you gotta do the math.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.997
It's impossible.

11:30.999 --> 11:34.233
Nobody can figure out
these equations.

11:34.235 --> 11:39.005
I bet the chief medical examiner
of the commonwealth could.

11:39.007 --> 11:42.174
Okay, maura does not want
to tutor me.

11:42.176 --> 11:43.442
Sure, she would!

11:43.444 --> 11:46.279
She probably does polynomials

from the makeup, isn't it?

11:59.527 --> 12:01.027
I know.

12:01.029 --> 12:03.763
These scars -- they're elaborate
and creative.

12:03.765 --> 12:07.233
This one on the forehead is made
of corn syrup and gelatin.

12:07.235 --> 12:09.235
Delicious.
Mmm.

12:09.237 --> 12:12.772
Anyway,
actual cause of death

12:12.774 --> 12:14.674
Is subarachnoid hemorrhage.

12:14.676 --> 12:18.878
So from impact from
the sidewalk, as i suspected.

12:18.880 --> 12:21.447
You find the other
nonedible wounds?

12:21.449 --> 12:23.015
Oh, yeah.

12:23.017 --> 12:26.085
X-ray showed that the fourth
metacarpal is fractured.

12:26.087 --> 12:28.054
So he landed a blow
before he went down?

12:28.056 --> 12:29.188
Mm.

12:29.190 --> 12:30.690
This makeup might've
transferred to his hand

12:30.692 --> 12:32.191
After he struck
his assailant.

12:33.995 --> 12:36.228
Right.
Swab the hand for skin cells.

12:36.230 --> 12:37.763
Maybe we could recover
some dna

12:37.765 --> 12:39.632
That would identify
who he was fighting.

12:39.634 --> 12:42.902
I'll let jane know
where we're at.

12:42.904 --> 12:44.236
Uh, maura?
Yes.

12:44.238 --> 12:47.840
I've actually been doing
some research on your symptoms.

12:47.842 --> 12:50.943
I think it's possible that you
may have a chiari malformation.

12:50.945 --> 12:53.746
That's a genetic condition,
isn't it?

12:53.748 --> 12:56.148
Congenital structural defect
of the cerebellum, yeah.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.451
It could've been lying
dormant until it was unmasked

12:58.453 --> 13:00.319
By your head trauma.

13:03.124 --> 13:05.591
I hadn't considered that.

13:05.593 --> 13:07.626
Hey, come on.

13:07.628 --> 13:11.530
My research shows
there's room for optimism.

13:11.532 --> 13:13.032
I'm sure there is.

13:13.034 --> 13:15.301
I'm sorry, it's just, um...

13:15.303 --> 13:17.470
Daunting
to objectively diagnose

13:17.472 --> 13:19.438
Something that affects me
so deeply.

13:19.440 --> 13:21.941
Yeah, well, it's not your job
to be objective.

13:21.943 --> 13:24.510
That's why i'm here.

13:24.512 --> 13:28.180
And i've left the reading
on your desk.

13:28.182 --> 13:30.349
I'll take a look at it.

13:30.351 --> 13:32.785
Thank you.
Sure.

13:41.562 --> 13:44.163
Hey.

13:44.165 --> 13:45.865
So these are
the stolen wallet victims?

13:45.867 --> 13:47.733
Yep.

13:47.735 --> 13:50.669
Security said that seven people
filed a report.

13:50.671 --> 13:53.372
Right. These are the four whose
wallets you found on the body.

13:53.374 --> 13:55.274
these are the other
three victims.

13:55.276 --> 13:56.976
Their wallets
are in the wind.

13:56.978 --> 13:58.244
We talk to everybody?

13:58.246 --> 14:00.479
Yeah.
There's no likely suspects.

14:00.481 --> 14:02.748
They were all at zombiecon
at the time of the murder.

14:02.750 --> 14:07.420
So seven people with motive,
seven people with alibis.

14:07.422 --> 14:09.522
What about credit cards?

14:09.524 --> 14:11.257
The suspect might still
have some from the wallets

14:11.259 --> 14:13.526
We didn't recover.
Uh, if he doesn't know
that we're on to him.

14:13.528 --> 14:15.094
Mm-hmm. He might try
and use 'em.

14:15.096 --> 14:18.097
Can you flag all the missing
credit cards for me?

14:18.099 --> 14:20.199
anybody so much as buys
as tank of gas,

14:20.201 --> 14:21.367
I wanna know about it.

14:21.369 --> 14:23.803
This is my mug.
What?

14:23.805 --> 14:25.805
This is my mug.
I left it at your house.

14:25.807 --> 14:28.507
It is. You did.

14:28.509 --> 14:31.610
Problem?
no.

14:31.612 --> 14:32.945
It just has my drink in it,

14:32.947 --> 14:34.613
So i'm gonna wash it out,
and i'll get it back to you.

14:34.615 --> 14:36.949
Okay.
All right.

14:39.220 --> 14:40.386
I think jane knows that

14:40.388 --> 14:42.087
You spent the night
at my place last night.

14:42.089 --> 14:44.890
Because of a mug?
Or maybe because you're glowing.

14:44.892 --> 14:46.525
stop.
Hmm.

14:47.829 --> 14:49.295
Are you avoiding telling her
about us

14:49.297 --> 14:51.130
For any particular reason?

14:51.132 --> 14:52.965
I'm not avoiding.

14:52.967 --> 14:54.600
You hate chai.

14:54.602 --> 14:56.535
Okay, maybe i was avoiding
just a little bit.

14:56.537 --> 14:58.037
but only
because i don't want

14:58.039 --> 15:00.906
My family butting
into our relationship.

15:00.908 --> 15:02.708
It's bad enough that
my mom knows.

15:02.710 --> 15:04.443
Yeah, i understand.

15:04.445 --> 15:05.811
There are a few gems
in my family

15:05.813 --> 15:09.281
That i prefer to keep
in the dark for now, too.

15:09.283 --> 15:11.984
Okay, then.

15:11.986 --> 15:13.686
I don't need everyone
to know,

15:13.688 --> 15:15.788
As long as i know
<i>you're</i> sure about us.

15:15.790 --> 15:18.457
Oh, i'm sure,

15:18.459 --> 15:21.227
Even if it means i have to drink
all the chai in chai land.

15:23.397 --> 15:25.764
This is interesting.

15:25.766 --> 15:26.999
What is it?

15:27.001 --> 15:28.234
I'm monitoring message boards
and social media

15:28.236 --> 15:29.635
Around zombiecon.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.437
this video just popped up
with the title,

15:31.439 --> 15:32.938
"pickpocket gets schooled."

15:32.940 --> 15:36.108
That's our pickpocket.

15:36.110 --> 15:38.344
Look at that.
She catches him red-handed.

15:38.346 --> 15:40.145
This must be
cellphone footage.

15:42.083 --> 15:43.649
Who's the girl?

15:43.651 --> 15:45.584
Doesn't look like any of
the women who had filed reports.
Mm.

15:45.586 --> 15:46.685
Though,
why would she file one

15:46.687 --> 15:48.120
If she was planning
to go kill him?

15:50.157 --> 15:54.093
Our guy stole
the wrong zombie's wallet.

15:55.746 --> 15:57.412
Mckenzie, right?
Yeah, so i'm told.

15:57.414 --> 15:58.780
Nina reached out
to the zombie community

15:58.782 --> 16:00.482
To see if anyone could id
the girl in the video.

16:00.484 --> 16:02.183
That's what she came up with.

16:02.185 --> 16:04.619
"the zombie community"?

16:05.889 --> 16:08.056
Christine mckenzie.

16:08.058 --> 16:09.357
Aka "dead ringer"?

16:09.359 --> 16:11.826
Yeah, that's me.

16:11.828 --> 16:14.663
Uh, we'd like to speak to you
about your stolen wallet.

16:14.665 --> 16:16.031
What stolen wallet?

16:16.033 --> 16:18.800
Your wallet that was stolen
last night from zombiecon?

16:23.407 --> 16:27.175
I have my wallet.
Is there a problem?

16:28.912 --> 16:31.246
Can you explain this?

16:33.550 --> 16:36.818
Is that you?
Yeah, that's me, but i...

16:36.820 --> 16:38.753
I thought that guy was just
trying to grab my ass.

16:38.755 --> 16:41.756
I didn't know he stole
my wallet. What a jerk.

16:41.758 --> 16:43.558
Could you tell us how you happen
to have your wallet

16:43.560 --> 16:45.093
In your possession
in light of this photo?

16:45.095 --> 16:49.230
i-i found it
on my welcome mat this morning.

16:49.232 --> 16:51.366
I-i figured i just dropped it
coming home.

16:51.368 --> 16:52.534
Do you have a roommate?

16:52.536 --> 16:54.135
Anyone that can verify
when you got home?

16:54.137 --> 16:56.604
No.
How about where you were
between the time

16:56.606 --> 16:58.373
Your wallet was stolen
and the time you got home?

16:58.375 --> 16:59.941
I was at the convention.

16:59.943 --> 17:01.543
You have anyone to verify that?

17:01.545 --> 17:04.379
No. Why are you guys
so interested in where i was?

17:04.381 --> 17:06.414
Because the person who stole
your wallet is dead.

17:07.651 --> 17:10.018
He is?
Mm-hmm.

17:12.823 --> 17:15.457
You guys don't think that i had
anything to do with this?

17:15.459 --> 17:17.792
I think that until you can
verify your whereabouts,

17:17.794 --> 17:19.394
You should probably
come with us.

17:19.396 --> 17:20.962
Let's go.

17:24.468 --> 17:26.668
[ telephone ringing,
indistinct conversations ]

17:26.670 --> 17:28.570
Who doesn't know
their wallet was stolen?

17:28.572 --> 17:30.605
And then has it
miraculously returned?

17:30.607 --> 17:32.073
The zombie girl's story
sucks.

17:32.075 --> 17:34.576
It does, but we can't disprove
it till we put her at the scene.

17:34.578 --> 17:37.245
I ran a background on her.
Anything interesting?

17:37.247 --> 17:38.480
A restraining order

17:38.482 --> 17:40.715
Filed against her boyfriend
a year ago.

17:40.717 --> 17:42.650
Then there was also
a police report.

17:42.652 --> 17:44.786
I guess he was violent.
That's too bad.

17:44.788 --> 17:47.922
Maybe she was traumatized
by the abusive ex-boyfriend.

17:47.924 --> 17:50.358
And then the run-in
with the victim made her snap.

17:50.360 --> 17:51.559
I like it in theory,

17:51.561 --> 17:54.028
But she didn't seem like
the type to snap.

17:54.030 --> 17:55.663
What about
the ex-boyfriend?

17:55.665 --> 17:56.931
Maybe he sees her
with the victim

17:56.933 --> 17:58.133
And then goes after him?

17:58.135 --> 18:00.068
Let's find him, see what
he was up to all night.

18:00.070 --> 18:02.003
All right.

18:02.005 --> 18:03.638
[ elevator bell dings,
doors open ]

18:03.640 --> 18:05.373
Knock, knock. Busy?

18:05.375 --> 18:06.875
Not for you. Come in.

18:06.877 --> 18:09.677
I hate to bother you
with this...

18:09.679 --> 18:11.179
Jane already told me.

18:11.181 --> 18:12.814
Polynomial factoring?

18:12.816 --> 18:14.482
Yeah,
it's cruel and useless.

18:14.484 --> 18:15.884
I have to disagree.

18:15.886 --> 18:19.020
They are essential for work
with coding and cryptography.

18:19.022 --> 18:20.288
Mm-hmm.

18:20.290 --> 18:22.657
And they help build abstract
problem solving skills.

18:22.659 --> 18:25.360
Mm-hmm. Still not selling it.
Okay.

18:25.362 --> 18:27.996
I know it can seem tedious.

18:27.998 --> 18:31.633
But math can be tremendously
elegant at times.

18:31.635 --> 18:32.901
For example...

18:35.672 --> 18:38.840
Wow. What is that?
"a beautiful mind"?

18:38.842 --> 18:41.376
It's an ulam spiral.

18:41.378 --> 18:44.145
It shows that you can position
any set of numbers

18:44.147 --> 18:45.480
In a square grid,

18:45.482 --> 18:49.851
The prime numbers will always
line up in perfect diagonals.

18:51.888 --> 18:53.021
Oh.

18:53.023 --> 18:55.423
See?

18:55.425 --> 18:58.159
Every time, no matter
what number you start from.

18:58.161 --> 19:00.328
And polynomial factoring
is a useful tool

19:00.330 --> 19:01.796
In understanding
this phenomenon.

19:01.798 --> 19:04.566
Now tell me that this doesn't
capture your imagination.

19:04.568 --> 19:07.101
For the moment, the only thing
capturing my imagination

19:07.103 --> 19:08.770
Is that dead body
over there.

19:08.772 --> 19:12.674
Oh. I'm sorry about that.

19:12.676 --> 19:14.342
Oh, can we try this again
later?

19:14.344 --> 19:16.845
Yeah, sure. I'm just gonna
let it all sink in.

19:16.847 --> 19:18.046
Okay.

19:21.885 --> 19:23.284
Hey.

19:23.286 --> 19:25.920
Still processing the samples
from the skin and clothes.

19:25.922 --> 19:27.455
Should have a detailed analysis
very soon.

19:27.457 --> 19:29.691
Uh, what about the wallets?

19:29.693 --> 19:30.825
The four wallets from the scene

19:30.827 --> 19:32.227
All had the victim's blood
on them.

19:32.229 --> 19:34.362
Also, christine's wallet had
the victim's blood on it.

19:34.364 --> 19:37.298
So christine's wallet was on him
when he fell and bled?

19:37.300 --> 19:38.700
Very likely.

19:38.702 --> 19:41.436
Well, then she pulled it out
of his pocket and then took off.

19:41.438 --> 19:44.105
Well, i can't testify to that.
Why?

19:44.107 --> 19:46.174
A bloody wallet only means
that it was on the victim

19:46.176 --> 19:47.809
At the time he was bleeding.

19:47.811 --> 19:50.245
It doesn't place
christine herself at the scene.

19:50.247 --> 19:53.748
Well, it's a good thing i have
a witness who can.

19:59.623 --> 20:02.657
[ indistinct conversations,
telephone ringing in distance ]

20:09.466 --> 20:12.333
No one at the convention
volunteered for the lineup?

20:12.335 --> 20:16.371
Not one. Said they were paranoid
about picked out by mistake.

20:16.373 --> 20:18.606
Zombie profiling.
It's a real thing.

20:20.610 --> 20:23.011
You look disgusting.
Thank you.

20:23.013 --> 20:24.812
You just<i> had</i> to get in
on this, huh?

20:24.814 --> 20:26.047
Well, we needed the volunteers,

20:26.049 --> 20:28.349
And i've got
a really good stagger.

20:32.589 --> 20:34.422
Even if
jared id's christine,

20:34.424 --> 20:36.257
This is not gonna hold up...
In court.

20:36.259 --> 20:38.259
Probably not, but it'll justify
holding her.

20:38.261 --> 20:42.297
And looks like we have
our zombie lineup.

20:45.101 --> 20:47.335
Take your time.

20:47.337 --> 20:49.437
Hmm.

20:49.439 --> 20:52.173
Can you make them groan?

20:56.379 --> 20:58.112
can i get a groan

20:58.114 --> 21:00.014
From each of the zombies,
left to right, please?

21:10.126 --> 21:11.893
Hmm.

21:11.895 --> 21:14.963
Can you make them say,

21:14.965 --> 21:17.799
"brains..."?

21:17.801 --> 21:20.468
You didn't tell us
the suspect said, "brains."

21:20.470 --> 21:23.538
They didn't.
I just thought it'd be cool.

21:23.540 --> 21:26.474
You should know
i'm inclined to detain you.

21:26.476 --> 21:28.076
That would be unlawful.

21:28.078 --> 21:30.511
I'll come up
with something.

21:30.513 --> 21:32.146
Yeah, it's none of these people.

21:32.148 --> 21:34.716
You sure?
Yeah.

21:34.718 --> 21:36.684
And also...

21:36.686 --> 21:38.686
That guy? Really?

21:38.688 --> 21:40.321
What about him?

21:40.323 --> 21:42.657
That's the cop
that interviewed me at my house.

21:44.928 --> 21:46.995
Your killer's not here.

21:46.997 --> 21:48.229
Sorry.

21:55.472 --> 21:58.272
Turned out to be a more reliable
witness than i expected.

21:58.274 --> 21:59.607
Mm, yeah.

21:59.609 --> 22:01.642
And we just lost
our best suspect.

22:07.368 --> 22:10.135
So if we take christine
at her word,

22:10.137 --> 22:13.138
Her wallet was taken off
of the dead body,

22:13.140 --> 22:14.840
And returned to her
the night of the murder.

22:14.842 --> 22:16.808
Without her knowledge.

22:16.810 --> 22:18.677
Yeah, who does that?

22:18.679 --> 22:20.278
Good samaritan?

22:20.280 --> 22:22.614
Okay, well, then why didn't
he return all the wallets?

22:22.616 --> 22:24.116
Good point.

22:24.118 --> 22:25.283
And how did
this mystery man

22:25.285 --> 22:27.052
Get into christine's building
anyway?

22:27.054 --> 22:29.388
He lives there.
He has access.

22:29.390 --> 22:31.223
Followed her home
without her knowing.

22:31.225 --> 22:34.459
Or she knew and she's covering
for someone.

22:34.461 --> 22:35.627
What happened to the other
three wallets

22:35.629 --> 22:37.362
That weren't
at the crime scene?

22:37.364 --> 22:38.964
We talked to all the owners.

22:38.966 --> 22:41.333
None of them got
their wallets returned.

22:41.335 --> 22:43.402
Okay, so this is about
christine.

22:43.404 --> 22:44.536
Maybe he knows her.

22:44.538 --> 22:46.004
Well, the boyfriend's
a dead end.

22:46.006 --> 22:47.072
He lives in missouri now.

22:47.074 --> 22:48.640
She claims she doesn't know
anybody else

22:48.642 --> 22:50.142
Who might've done
something like this.

22:50.144 --> 22:52.411
Yeah, i wish i could
believe her.

22:52.413 --> 22:54.513
Paul grossman.

22:54.515 --> 22:57.015
He reported one of the wallets
stolen that we didn't recover.

22:57.017 --> 22:58.250
Did he get it back?

22:58.252 --> 22:59.618
No, which is interesting

22:59.620 --> 23:01.720
Because he just bought
a vacuum cleaner in dorchester,

23:01.722 --> 23:03.455
According to
his credit card company.

23:03.457 --> 23:04.856
Please tell me there's
security footage.

23:04.858 --> 23:07.859
Yeah. Nina already ran the image
through facial recognition.

23:07.861 --> 23:09.961
The guy's name
is terrence griffins.

23:09.963 --> 23:11.396
Has a history of petty theft.

23:11.398 --> 23:13.832
And a fondness
for zombie conferences, i bet.

23:13.834 --> 23:16.535
Uniforms are already
on their way to pick him up.

23:19.873 --> 23:22.674
No dna matches from
the blood samples on the victim?

23:22.676 --> 23:24.076
Nope. Nothing.

23:24.078 --> 23:27.546
Okay, then we'll have to wait
for a tox report.

23:27.548 --> 23:30.716
You mean
trace chemical analysis?

23:30.718 --> 23:32.784
What did i say?

23:36.390 --> 23:37.622
Another slip.

23:37.624 --> 23:40.959
No, no, you just -- you...
You misspoke.

23:40.961 --> 23:43.328
Or i'm losing it.
Or you're so scared
of having a slip

23:43.330 --> 23:45.130
That you're giving yourself
a complex.

23:45.132 --> 23:48.667
That's a very unscientific
justification.

23:48.669 --> 23:50.635
Look, maura, if the military
has taught me one thing,

23:50.637 --> 23:53.638
It's you make assessments
based on facts on the ground.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.273
Now you've not had a lapse
in ages.

23:55.275 --> 23:57.008
And we now have
a potential diagnosis,

23:57.010 --> 23:58.944
Which means
treatment options.

23:58.946 --> 24:01.446
It is not the time
to panic.

24:01.448 --> 24:04.516
I appreciate your optimism,

24:04.518 --> 24:06.885
But i feel that i owe it
to the people i serve

24:06.887 --> 24:08.754
To be the sharpest mind
in the room.

24:08.756 --> 24:11.857
Yeah,
and you are that mind.

24:11.859 --> 24:13.325
I'm not so sure.

24:13.327 --> 24:15.761
And i can't tell you
how frightening it is

24:15.763 --> 24:16.962
To have to admit.

24:24.171 --> 24:26.538
I'll, uh...

24:26.540 --> 24:28.840
I'll continue
with my analysis.

24:43.357 --> 24:45.090
Hey, vince.
Hey.

24:45.092 --> 24:47.292
Could you do me a favor?

24:47.294 --> 24:50.428
Could you bring this to maura
when you go back to the station?

24:50.430 --> 24:52.397
Sure. What's the occasion?

24:52.399 --> 24:55.267
I just want to thank her
for helping me with that exam.

24:55.269 --> 24:56.635
She was able to help you?

24:56.637 --> 24:58.837
She did the best
she could.

24:58.839 --> 25:01.606
But i'm a lose cause, and...

25:01.608 --> 25:03.175
Well, i...

25:03.177 --> 25:04.776
I dropped out of my group.

25:04.778 --> 25:07.312
Oh, i'm sorry to hear that.

25:07.314 --> 25:08.780
you don't seem relieved.

25:08.782 --> 25:12.217
Well, i'm not.
I feel terrible.

25:12.219 --> 25:14.286
Why is that?

25:14.288 --> 25:16.788
Because after i dropped out,
max texted me

25:16.790 --> 25:18.790
And told me
he's giving up, too.

25:18.792 --> 25:20.692
Oh, that's too bad.

25:20.694 --> 25:22.561
Oh, he's a bright kid.

25:22.563 --> 25:24.462
And this could be a chance
for him to --

25:24.464 --> 25:27.299
To totally
turn his life around.

25:27.301 --> 25:28.567
Maybe he just needs
some encouragement.

25:28.569 --> 25:29.868
He probably
looks up to you.

25:29.870 --> 25:32.470
Well, i can't tell him
not to quit.

25:32.472 --> 25:34.306
I'd be a hypocrite.

25:34.308 --> 25:36.241
Not if you take the test.

25:37.778 --> 25:39.411
But what if i fail?

25:39.413 --> 25:42.581
Well, you definitely will
if you don't try.

25:52.960 --> 25:54.192
You've got a lot
of a theft charges

25:54.194 --> 25:57.062
For a guy barely out
of high school, terrence.

25:57.064 --> 25:58.430
What are you doing
stealing wallets?

25:58.432 --> 26:00.532
What wallets?
From zombiecon.

26:00.534 --> 26:03.034
How do you know
i was at zombiecon?

26:03.036 --> 26:06.705
Because i'm a better cop
than you are a thief.

26:06.707 --> 26:08.340
Tell me about
kendall judd.

26:08.342 --> 26:09.541
Who?

26:11.211 --> 26:14.045
I'm gonna say this once.

26:14.047 --> 26:15.513
You and kendall were both
lifting wallets

26:15.515 --> 26:17.916
From that convention,
and now one of you is dead.

26:17.918 --> 26:19.918
I need to understand
your relationship

26:19.920 --> 26:23.121
Or best case, i arrest you
for obstruction.

26:23.123 --> 26:26.358
Worst case, you become
my number one suspect.

26:30.230 --> 26:32.797
I've been hitting zombiecon
for years.

26:32.799 --> 26:34.366
It's my turf.

26:34.368 --> 26:37.235
Kendall was threatening
my whole operation.

26:38.438 --> 26:41.172
How so?
The thing with the girl
that went viral?

26:41.174 --> 26:42.607
That's bad
for everyone's business.

26:42.609 --> 26:45.744
So you wanted him to back off?
Yeah, but i didn't kill him.

26:45.746 --> 26:47.946
But i wasn't the only one
he pissed off.

26:47.948 --> 26:49.114
What do you mean?

26:49.116 --> 26:51.816
Some other guy
followed kendall outside.

26:51.818 --> 26:53.752
Maybe one of his marks.
I don't know.

26:53.754 --> 26:55.921
I figured he'd teach kendall
a lesson for me, too.

26:55.923 --> 26:59.291
Can you describe this guy?
About my age.

26:59.293 --> 27:01.960
Skinny. Tattered clothes.

27:01.962 --> 27:04.462
His makeup
was super elaborate.

27:04.464 --> 27:05.730
Anything else?

27:05.732 --> 27:07.432
He had a limp.

27:07.434 --> 27:09.768
Doesn't everyone have a limp
at zombiecon?

27:09.770 --> 27:11.236
Yeah,
when you're in character,

27:11.238 --> 27:12.971
Not when you're ducking out
the back door

27:12.973 --> 27:14.606
To kick the guy's ass
that just robbed ya.

27:23.684 --> 27:25.150
Hi.
Hey.

27:25.152 --> 27:28.053
I have
the trace chemical analysis

27:28.055 --> 27:30.255
From the victim's fist.

27:31.725 --> 27:33.692
Corn syrup.
From the fake blood.

27:33.694 --> 27:36.962
Mineral oil and titanium dioxide
from the stage makeup.

27:36.964 --> 27:38.697
Also, there was a fair amount
of real blood

27:38.699 --> 27:40.632
From two different
blood types.

27:40.634 --> 27:42.801
The victim's
and the suspect's?
Most likely.

27:42.803 --> 27:44.069
Okay. Did you find any dna?

27:44.071 --> 27:45.503
No, uh, matches,

27:45.505 --> 27:47.973
But i did want
to show you this.

27:47.975 --> 27:50.942
Castor seed oil, fumed silica,
sucrose acetate --

27:50.944 --> 27:54.145
Ingredients found
in something called microskin.

27:54.147 --> 27:56.848
What's that?
Lightweight, waterproof
cosmetic product

27:56.850 --> 27:58.483
With exceptional
breathability,

27:58.485 --> 28:00.618
Ideally used
for burn victims.

28:00.620 --> 28:02.487
That was on
our victim's hand?

28:02.489 --> 28:04.155
Likely rubbed off
during contact.

28:04.157 --> 28:07.492
So this wasn't
normal zombie makeup?

28:07.494 --> 28:09.794
No. Microskin is expensive.

28:09.796 --> 28:11.997
Application is more involved
than regular makeup.

28:11.999 --> 28:14.699
And you can only get it
through the manufacturer.

28:14.701 --> 28:16.401
He used it
because he needed it.

28:16.403 --> 28:17.635
Right.

28:17.637 --> 28:19.304
We're not looking
for a zombie.

28:19.306 --> 28:22.207
We're looking
for a burn victim.

28:22.209 --> 28:23.308
Thanks.

28:29.833 --> 28:31.866
A burn victim?
Mm-hmm.

28:31.868 --> 28:33.868
Someone with
a facial disfigurement

28:33.870 --> 28:36.270
Where he might need
to cover it up with makeup.

28:36.272 --> 28:38.673
I can't think of anyone.

28:38.675 --> 28:41.542
He might also have
a pronounced limp.

28:43.913 --> 28:46.514
What? You know someone
like that?

28:46.516 --> 28:49.384
It -- it can't be him.
Who?

28:49.386 --> 28:52.754
This guy who waters the plants
in my building -- he limps.

28:52.756 --> 28:56.457
He's really shy. I-i always
felt so sorry for him.

28:56.459 --> 28:57.859
How much did you talk
to him?

28:57.861 --> 29:00.094
I complimented him on his work
on our rooftop garden.

29:00.096 --> 29:01.629
That's about it.

29:01.631 --> 29:02.897
What about zombiecon?

29:02.899 --> 29:05.666
I don't think
i mentioned it to him.

29:05.668 --> 29:09.237
I mean, i-i guess he could've
seen me leave in my costume.

29:11.241 --> 29:13.374
Oh, god. Do you think
that he followed me there?

29:14.611 --> 29:17.311
Do you know his name?

29:17.313 --> 29:18.746
Zachary bale.

29:18.748 --> 29:21.082
He worked at a greenhouse that
services plants all over boston,

29:21.084 --> 29:22.884
Including the building
christine lives in.

29:22.886 --> 29:27.088
this photo is from
his employee badge.

29:27.090 --> 29:29.357
There's the facial scarring.

29:29.359 --> 29:31.459
Christine probably didn't
notice it through the makeup.

29:31.461 --> 29:34.429
The greenhouse owner
confirm the limp?
Yeah.

29:34.431 --> 29:38.299
He also said he fired zachary
recently for stealing plants.

29:38.301 --> 29:40.101
Who steals plants?

29:40.103 --> 29:41.436
Ah. The owner confronted him
about it,

29:41.438 --> 29:43.571
And then zachary became
real agitated.

29:43.573 --> 29:46.340
Owner said he seemed unstable.

29:46.342 --> 29:48.443
Emotionally unstable
burn victim with a limp

29:48.445 --> 29:50.478
And a fixation on christine.

29:50.480 --> 29:52.313
And access to her building.

29:52.315 --> 29:54.282
Did we pick him up?

29:54.284 --> 29:55.616
Here's the thing.

29:55.618 --> 29:57.585
The owner paid in cash
and didn't ask many questions.

29:57.587 --> 29:59.487
He never verified zachary's id.

29:59.489 --> 30:01.189
So the address he gave
was a fake?

30:01.191 --> 30:02.523
Everything was a fake.

30:02.525 --> 30:04.425
I can't find any background
on anyone by this name.

30:04.427 --> 30:07.295
Emotionally unstable
burn victim using an alias.

30:07.297 --> 30:09.697
I'm gonna warn christine
to be looking out for this guy.

30:09.699 --> 30:11.399
That burn makeup is the key.

30:11.401 --> 30:12.967
He'd have to use
a real address

30:12.969 --> 30:14.869
To have it delivered
somewhere he can pick it up.

30:14.871 --> 30:17.171
Check with the manufacturer,
see where in the area they ship.

30:28.284 --> 30:30.351
[ elevator bell dings,
doors open ]

30:33.456 --> 30:35.123
hi.

30:35.125 --> 30:37.859
We're running down addresses
where microskin ships.

30:37.861 --> 30:40.561
Might be our best clue
to this guy's identity.

30:40.563 --> 30:42.230
Well, i hope you get
the results quickly.

30:42.232 --> 30:44.799
yeah, you said you needed
to give me something?

30:44.801 --> 30:48.102
Yes. Um...

30:48.104 --> 30:50.738
Well, i have been
reading the research

30:50.740 --> 30:52.673
About chiari malformations.

30:52.675 --> 30:55.843
It may be the source
of my condition.

30:55.845 --> 30:57.712
Okay. What's it say?

30:57.714 --> 30:59.547
Well, there is a procedure
to alleviate the pressure

30:59.549 --> 31:02.917
On the cerebellum, and it could
eliminate my symptoms entirely.

31:02.919 --> 31:04.785
Well, this is great, right?

31:04.787 --> 31:07.121
Well, there's also a chance
that it doesn't work

31:07.123 --> 31:08.222
Or my symptoms worsen,

31:08.224 --> 31:10.091
Rendering me unable
to perform my duties.

31:10.093 --> 31:12.160
But that's not gonna happen.
Maybe not.

31:12.162 --> 31:13.728
But until i can be sure,

31:13.730 --> 31:16.531
I can't let our cases
rest in the balance.

31:19.369 --> 31:21.068
What's this?

31:21.070 --> 31:22.570
My resignation.

31:22.572 --> 31:24.672
If the day comes --
maura.

31:24.674 --> 31:26.507
Come on. This is a little
premature, don't you --

31:26.509 --> 31:29.844
No, this is more than prema--
this is like the nuclear option.

31:29.846 --> 31:33.080
I just wanna be prepared
for the worst-case scenario.

31:33.082 --> 31:34.916
I don't want you to have
the burden of having

31:34.918 --> 31:36.551
To make that call for me
down the road.

31:36.553 --> 31:38.219
Well, what about
the best-case scenario?

31:38.221 --> 31:39.820
You know, the one where
you get better?

31:46.162 --> 31:49.864
Look...Maura,
i know this is scary for you.

31:49.866 --> 31:51.632
It's scary for me, too,
okay?

31:51.634 --> 31:55.069
And -- and i will hold on
to this if that's what you want.

31:55.071 --> 31:56.904
But i know
i'm not gonna need it.

31:58.241 --> 32:00.107
I just don't wanna let
anyone down.

32:00.109 --> 32:01.976
You never have.

32:01.978 --> 32:03.744
okay?

32:05.448 --> 32:08.249
nina's got something.

32:08.251 --> 32:11.052
Look, we -- we're gonna talk
more about this later.

32:11.054 --> 32:13.254
Okay? Everything's gonna be
all right.

32:18.428 --> 32:20.795
Dr. Maura isles
does not resign.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.813
Hey.
Hey.

32:38.815 --> 32:41.315
So nina got a list
of local addresses

32:41.317 --> 32:42.617
Where microskin ships.

32:42.619 --> 32:44.418
I pulled dmv photos
for all recipients

32:44.420 --> 32:46.420
To compare them to
our suspect's work badge,

32:46.422 --> 32:48.422
And i found a match.

32:48.424 --> 32:51.058
Nice.
His real name
is jeremy kendricks.

32:51.060 --> 32:53.594
It looks like he was disfigured
in a childhood accident.

32:53.596 --> 32:56.197
I can't imagine kids
on the playground were kind.

32:56.199 --> 32:58.866
He's got a spotty work history,
moves around a lot.

32:58.868 --> 33:00.334
Arrest record?

33:00.336 --> 33:02.770
yeah. Bar fights
and vandalism.

33:02.772 --> 33:05.139
He's angry.
Has been for a long time.

33:05.141 --> 33:06.807
okay,
did we talk to christine?

33:06.809 --> 33:08.409
Yep. I told her
the suspect's real name

33:08.411 --> 33:09.844
And to stay put
until we find him.

33:09.846 --> 33:11.045
Where was she when you
spoke to her?

33:11.047 --> 33:13.948
She's on her way home.
That may be a problem.

33:13.950 --> 33:16.050
jeremy kendrick's cellphone
is pinging off the same tower

33:16.052 --> 33:17.818
As christine's.

33:17.820 --> 33:20.388
He got fired. He lives
on the other side of town.

33:20.390 --> 33:24.025
He has no business in that area.
He's going after her.

33:42.771 --> 33:45.572
I've been waiting
for this moment.

33:47.176 --> 33:48.775
Uh...

33:51.080 --> 33:53.080
I thought you were
someone else.

33:53.082 --> 33:54.681
Sorry to disappoint you.

33:57.119 --> 33:58.619
She's not coming.

33:58.621 --> 34:00.921
She got your note, and we
told her to stay put.

34:00.923 --> 34:03.457
And who are you?
Jane rizzoli, boston police.

34:08.030 --> 34:09.263
Christine called the police
on me?

34:09.265 --> 34:11.198
No, she didn't do anything.

34:11.200 --> 34:12.666
But you and i,
we need to talk about

34:12.668 --> 34:14.001
What happened
with her wallet.

34:14.003 --> 34:17.004
Nothing happened. All right?
That guy was bothering her.

34:17.006 --> 34:19.940
Yeah, we know that part.
He shouldn't have touched her.

34:19.942 --> 34:22.376
So you went after him?

34:22.378 --> 34:23.810
No, i was trying to help.

34:25.314 --> 34:28.115
Look, she's nice to me.
I just -- i just wanted to help.

34:28.117 --> 34:30.817
Hey, whoa, whoa!
Jeremy, jeremy, hey.

34:30.819 --> 34:32.586
Look at me.
Look at me, all right? Look.

34:32.588 --> 34:34.188
Hey, look at me.

34:36.325 --> 34:37.391
Let's talk about this, okay?

34:37.393 --> 34:38.825
Yeah, come away
from the ledge, man.

34:38.827 --> 34:40.861
You don't know
what it's like!

34:40.863 --> 34:43.564
Okay, so just
explain it to us.

34:43.566 --> 34:46.033
Zombiecon...

34:46.035 --> 34:48.802
Was the first place
that i felt...Normal.

34:48.804 --> 34:51.238
People weren't staring at me,
all right?

34:51.240 --> 34:54.107
I was finally gonna...

34:54.109 --> 34:55.709
I was finally gonna
talk to her.

34:59.014 --> 35:01.748
Why'd he have to spoil it?

35:01.750 --> 35:03.650
I don't know.

35:05.521 --> 35:08.388
I didn't mean to kill him.
I believe that.

35:09.992 --> 35:12.226
J-jeremy, hey,
i believe that.

35:12.228 --> 35:13.627
No, you don't.
I do.

35:13.629 --> 35:17.864
No, you don't. You think
i'm a monster, a freak!

35:17.866 --> 35:20.234
Uh, hey, jeremy! Hey.

35:20.236 --> 35:23.303
Listen to me, okay?
I think that you have had

35:23.305 --> 35:25.339
A very, very hard road,
all right?

35:25.341 --> 35:27.808
But you still wanted to do
something nice for christine.

35:27.810 --> 35:31.011
I-i admire that.
We all -- we admire that.

35:31.013 --> 35:32.846
It doesn't have to be
the end of the road.

35:32.848 --> 35:34.881
Nobody wants that.
come on.

35:34.883 --> 35:36.516
Nobody cares!

35:36.518 --> 35:38.752
jeremy, stop!

35:43.192 --> 35:47.427
Please.
Please don't do this.

35:52.301 --> 35:53.767
Come on.

35:53.769 --> 35:55.736
Come on, jeremy.

35:55.738 --> 35:57.304
Come on.

36:06.282 --> 36:08.782
you okay?
yeah.

36:15.758 --> 36:17.157
All right, thanks.

36:17.159 --> 36:19.059
Da was still up?

36:19.061 --> 36:21.595
Ugh. Based on the nature
of the wounds,

36:21.597 --> 36:23.563
He'll consider
involuntary manslaughter,

36:23.565 --> 36:25.632
Conditional to jeremy
getting therapy.

36:25.634 --> 36:27.968
He could be out in a few years.
Well, he's young.

36:27.970 --> 36:29.770
If he gets the help he needs,
might be a shot for him.

36:29.772 --> 36:31.271
Maybe.

36:33.475 --> 36:35.776
I hate that word. "freak."

36:35.778 --> 36:37.144
This kid could've had
a good life

36:37.146 --> 36:38.679
If people had just been kind,
you know?

36:38.681 --> 36:41.448
Not treat him like
a monster.

36:41.450 --> 36:44.384
Same thing could be said
for zombies.

36:44.386 --> 36:45.986
What?

36:45.988 --> 36:47.554
They didn't ask to be
the way they are.

36:47.556 --> 36:50.757
Can they help it if they find
human brains delicious? No.

36:50.759 --> 36:53.126
Poor schmucks can't do
a damn thing about it.

36:55.297 --> 36:58.732
I feel you need
a new hobby.

37:00.336 --> 37:02.502
Good night.
Good night.

37:06.842 --> 37:09.343
Jane.
Huh.<i> What?</i>

37:09.345 --> 37:11.845
One more thing.
I've been thinking.

37:11.847 --> 37:13.880
There's something
i want you to know.

37:13.882 --> 37:16.183
What? What is it?
Well, it's fairly new
at this point.

37:16.185 --> 37:18.752
It's about me and --
there you are.

37:18.754 --> 37:20.153
Um, i'm sorry to interrupt.

37:20.155 --> 37:23.957
I -- frankie, i really need
to talk to you, privately.

37:23.959 --> 37:25.325
Ah.

37:25.327 --> 37:27.427
Uh...

37:28.897 --> 37:30.263
rain check.

37:30.265 --> 37:32.966
Yeah, i'll get the next one.

37:32.968 --> 37:35.001
I was telling her about us.

37:35.003 --> 37:36.837
I know.
Then why'd you stop me?

37:36.839 --> 37:38.905
Because the fact that
you were willing to do it

37:38.907 --> 37:41.908
Means more to me
than you actually doing it.

37:41.910 --> 37:44.544
Really?
Yeah.

37:44.546 --> 37:47.547
Plus, it's fun to have a secret,
don't you think?

37:47.549 --> 37:53.253
I think that i really want
to kiss you right now.

37:55.190 --> 37:58.358
You're just
gonna have to wait.

38:01.897 --> 38:03.597
How is that fun?

38:11.707 --> 38:13.407
Thanks.
Hey.

38:13.409 --> 38:15.575
Hey, max.
You wanted me to come down?

38:15.577 --> 38:18.545
Yeah, i wanted to talk
about our study group.

38:18.547 --> 38:20.947
What group? We quit.

38:20.949 --> 38:23.216
Have a seat.

38:24.787 --> 38:28.288
Max, you know,
before you were even born,

38:28.290 --> 38:31.124
Somebody told me
i didn't need that diploma.

38:31.126 --> 38:33.527
And i was naive enough
to listen.

38:33.529 --> 38:35.228
I didn't know
that eventually,

38:35.230 --> 38:39.433
I would be divorced
from that dope.

38:39.435 --> 38:41.234
I didn't know i'd be
working at this bar.

38:41.236 --> 38:45.172
I mean, i-i didn't know
a lot of things.

38:45.174 --> 38:47.274
Nobody knows the future.

38:47.276 --> 38:50.243
exactly.

38:50.245 --> 38:53.780
It is, by definition,
unknown.

38:53.782 --> 38:56.183
The future is "x."

38:56.185 --> 38:59.119
A variable.

38:59.121 --> 39:03.623
So i don't know if we're ever
gonna have to use this math,

39:03.625 --> 39:05.258
But i know that
if we work together,

39:05.260 --> 39:07.127
We could pass that exam.

39:10.199 --> 39:12.399
Yeah, i understand.

39:12.401 --> 39:14.534
I need your help.

39:14.536 --> 39:18.305
Can't do it alone.
Yeah, i'm in.

39:18.307 --> 39:20.006
Yeah?
Yeah.

39:22.744 --> 39:24.744
Thank you.
All right.

39:24.746 --> 39:26.680
You'll be back here tomorrow?
I'll see you then.

39:26.682 --> 39:28.081
Okay.

39:32.721 --> 39:33.887
Hi, ma.

39:33.889 --> 39:35.222
Hey, honey.

39:36.992 --> 39:39.960
Oh, my god! You, too?

39:39.962 --> 39:41.161
It's kent's handiwork.

39:41.163 --> 39:43.063
Analyzing the victim's makeup
made him wonder

39:43.065 --> 39:45.298
If he could improve
on the formula.

39:45.300 --> 39:47.767
And it took<i> a lot</i> of tries
to achieve

39:47.769 --> 39:50.303
The correct viscosity
of rotten flesh.

39:50.305 --> 39:52.305
There's a lot going on
in that sentence, maura.

39:52.307 --> 39:55.308
Hey, janie.
What can i get ya?

39:55.310 --> 39:58.311
Uh, i'll have a beer.

39:58.313 --> 40:00.046
And some neosporin.

40:00.048 --> 40:02.549
come on.

40:02.551 --> 40:03.650
Admit it.
This looks just like

40:03.652 --> 40:06.686
Advanced stage
arthropod-induced decay.

40:06.688 --> 40:09.556
You want me to say that to you
like it's a compliment.

40:09.558 --> 40:11.558
I just want you
to be honest.

40:11.560 --> 40:14.561
You look very...
Decayed?

40:14.563 --> 40:15.795
Happy?
Yes!

40:15.797 --> 40:17.697
All right. Ugh.

40:17.699 --> 40:19.299
Well, actually,
compared to these guys,

40:19.301 --> 40:20.967
You kind of phoned it in,
don't you think?

40:22.571 --> 40:24.037
Can i help you?

40:24.039 --> 40:26.573
We heard it's first drink free
for anyone dressed as zombies.

40:26.575 --> 40:28.508
You did? From who?

40:28.510 --> 40:30.510
Me. I had some business cards
in my pocket,

40:30.512 --> 40:31.811
So i handed them out
at the convention.

40:31.813 --> 40:34.481
You know,
build our client base.

40:34.483 --> 40:36.316
Can we get some shots?

40:36.318 --> 40:37.851
Oh, here we go.
Yeah.

40:37.853 --> 40:40.687
I hope the undead are
good tippers.

40:41.990 --> 40:45.025
<i>[ 1980's style dance music</i>
<i>playing ]</i>

40:51.600 --> 40:54.334
Oh, unh-unh. Oh, no.

40:54.336 --> 40:56.803
Unh-unh!

40:59.441 --> 41:01.074
nope!

41:04.012 --> 41:05.512
No.

41:05.514 --> 41:08.715
No. You're not even old enough
to be in here.

41:08.717 --> 41:11.885
Thank you, ma.
Appreciate it.

41:14.690 --> 41:15.889
No.

41:15.891 --> 41:17.424
No.<i> Yes.</i> No.
