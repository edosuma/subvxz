11:36.479 --> 11:38.087
KIT:
That's Pete.

11:38.189 --> 11:40.106
He's a tennis pro,

11:40.200 --> 11:43.368
now with myocarditis
as a result of this virus.

11:43.561 --> 11:45.203
He's 33 and he might die.

Fit won't save you.

Here you go.

Don't intubate

Nic, please. She wouldn't

13:43.698 --> 13:44.897
You know my mom.

13:47.944 --> 13:49.810
Listen, first off all,
are you feeling okay?

13:49.830 --> 13:52.722
Good. So, your mom wants you
to go home and isolate.

Take care of yourself,
and I will call you

13:54.325 --> 13:55.725

Uh, you hold the fate
of the hospital in your hands.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.666
Red Rock needs you

14:12.727 --> 14:14.835

Can't cut. Everyone's afraid.

14:14.896 --> 14:16.003
Especially the sickest people

14:16.022 --> 14:17.355
who need the operations
the most.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.023
They're afraid COVID
is gonna kill them.

14:19.175 --> 14:20.841

Then-then focus
on elective surgeries.

14:20.902 --> 14:24.011
Stents, uh, knee replacements,
disc repair, uh, plastics.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.530
BELL:
It's against CMS guidelines.

Elective surgeries
use precious PPE,

14:27.391 --> 14:29.534
hospital beds and resources.

14:29.727 --> 14:31.444
KIM:
We don't have
a multibillion-dollar endowment

14:31.538 --> 14:33.613
like the Mayo Clinic.
I have to make payroll.

14:33.707 --> 14:36.449
D-Do you understand
that this hospital will close?

14:36.543 --> 14:38.859
-Thousands of jobs are at stake.
-AUSTIN: Yeah, but the only job

14:38.879 --> 14:40.603
you're worried about
is your own, Kim.

14:40.663 --> 14:42.605
-KIM: That's not true.
-Really?

14:42.624 --> 14:44.698
KIM:
I-I know we haven't always
been on the same side,

14:44.759 --> 14:46.718
but we need to work together
this time.

14:46.869 --> 14:48.611

There's a government bailout
coming.

14:48.671 --> 14:51.297

-KIT: Red Rock's bank account.

14:51.449 --> 14:53.600

You're the chief of surgery.
My rainmaker.

15:01.234 --> 15:04.644
I... Help me to save Chastain.

15:04.738 --> 15:05.978
Take the lowest-risk
elective surgeries

15:06.072 --> 15:08.389

15:08.450 --> 15:11.926

Okay, on one condition.

15:11.928 --> 15:14.820
Don't ever threaten my job again
or replace my face

15:14.956 --> 15:18.583
on the side of this building
with a shiny new object.

15:18.776 --> 15:20.418

Deal.

15:31.747 --> 15:33.681

15:37.479 --> 15:39.920

15:39.940 --> 15:41.773
Dr. Cain?

15:41.966 --> 15:43.666
<i> Is there something wrong?</i>

15:43.726 --> 15:45.184
I'm afraid so.

15:45.336 --> 15:46.444
Listen, I know that I told you

15:46.637 --> 15:48.446
your back surgery
could wait, Ben,

15:48.597 --> 15:52.116
but I took another look
at your last scan this morning.

15:53.119 --> 15:54.285
Is there a problem?

15:54.478 --> 15:55.845
<i> Yes. I see some progression</i>

15:55.905 --> 15:59.457
in your disc herniation
at your L5-S1 vertebrae

15:59.650 --> 16:01.960
with some potential involvement
of your spinal cord.

16:02.153 --> 16:05.371
-My spinal cord?
<i> -Yes, yes,</i>
<i> and it's getting worse.</i>

16:05.465 --> 16:08.024
I need to get you
into the OR immediately.

16:08.042 --> 16:10.468
But it's not safe
at the hospital.

16:10.661 --> 16:13.471
-The coronavirus is...
<i> -Oh, no, our surgical</i>
<i> facilities are pristine.</i>

16:13.664 --> 16:15.622
Yeah, never been cleaner
or safer.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.383
And you won't be anywhere near
a COVID patient.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.051
<i> We'll take every precaution.</i>

16:19.145 --> 16:21.628
(exhales)

16:21.648 --> 16:25.374
I don't know.
Um, I have to think about this.

16:25.393 --> 16:28.653
See, here's the thing, Ben,

16:28.846 --> 16:31.823
if you put this off,
you take one bad step,

16:32.016 --> 16:33.992
<i> you slip and fall</i>
<i> in the bathroom...</i>

16:35.036 --> 16:36.852
...you'll end up paralyzed.

16:36.871 --> 16:39.497
Oh, my God, Dr. Cain.

16:39.690 --> 16:41.457
(exhales)

16:43.420 --> 16:46.004
Okay.

16:46.197 --> 16:47.630
I'll do whatever you say.

16:56.040 --> 16:57.640
(phone ringing)

16:59.043 --> 17:00.243
Devon?

17:00.303 --> 17:02.353
How are you?

17:03.523 --> 17:05.523
Are you driving your cab again?

17:05.716 --> 17:06.691
That's one of the riskiest
things you could do.

17:06.842 --> 17:08.584
You promised me you'd stay home.

17:08.686 --> 17:11.087
-And who is going
to pay my rent, Devon?
<i> -I will.</i>

17:11.105 --> 17:14.090
<i> Listen, Dad, our ER is packed.</i>
<i> Our ICU, too.</i>

17:14.108 --> 17:16.200
Think about Mom.
You could get infected,

17:16.393 --> 17:17.535
<i> you could take it home to her,</i>
<i> she could die.</i>

17:17.728 --> 17:19.278
<i> You both could.</i>

17:19.430 --> 17:22.448
I need you to turn that cab
around and go home now.

17:22.600 --> 17:24.617
Dad, you need to leave
the facility and quarantine now.

17:24.753 --> 17:27.119
It's really not a good time,
Nicky. I'm only--

17:27.272 --> 17:28.862
-I'm halfway through treatment.
If I leave...
<i> -I know,</i>

17:28.923 --> 17:31.123
<i> but I wouldn't be asking</i>
<i> if it wasn't serious.</i>

17:31.276 --> 17:33.033
Please. I'll get you
a hotel room.

17:33.094 --> 17:34.385
Just tell me you'll do this.

17:37.173 --> 17:40.058
Yeah, okay. Okay, okay. Uh...

17:40.251 --> 17:42.376
Anything for you, Nicky.

17:42.437 --> 17:44.228
Okay.

17:45.106 --> 17:47.732
Dad, where are you?

17:47.883 --> 17:50.068
I finally got a guy
who's willing to manufacture

17:50.261 --> 17:52.311
the new mask prototypes,

17:52.463 --> 17:55.981
<i> but now he is telling me that</i>
<i> there are no more materials.</i>

17:56.134 --> 17:59.560
You have Crohn's disease
and a compromised immune system.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.562
We agreed that you were
gonna work from home.

18:01.623 --> 18:03.915
Hear my voice.
This is me not happy with you.

18:04.066 --> 18:05.750
<i> You need to solve</i>
<i> this issue from home.</i>

18:05.943 --> 18:07.476
As soon as I'm finished here.

CHAD:
Hey, you, nurse.
I've been waiting for two hours.

18:29.025 --> 18:31.183
I got gold-plated insurance.

18:31.336 --> 18:32.668
-The taxes I pay,
I should be first in line.
-MINA: Hey, hey, hey.

18:32.687 --> 18:34.612
There's no special treatment
in this ER.

18:34.763 --> 18:36.522
Put your mask up, six feet apart
or you're out of here.

18:36.658 --> 18:38.950
I am six feet apart.

18:39.101 --> 18:41.101
What are you trying to do,
set a world record for people

18:41.162 --> 18:43.162
in an ER in the middle
of a pandemic?

18:44.457 --> 18:46.532
MINA:
I understand the male temptation

18:46.626 --> 18:48.084

18:49.129 --> 18:51.354
...but you need to back up.

18:51.455 --> 18:53.022

18:53.082 --> 18:54.966
What-- Don't touch me!

18:55.159 --> 18:57.218
He's not six feet apart!

19:01.558 --> 19:04.367
IRVING:
We've got five minutes
before our next crisis.

19:04.427 --> 19:06.369
-JESSICA: It is crazy out there.
-IRVING: And unsafe.

19:06.387 --> 19:07.887
I really wish
you were back in the OR

19:08.022 --> 19:09.388
working as a scrub nurse.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.315
JESSICA:
I'm right where I want to be.

19:18.199 --> 19:20.283
I'm laying my head
on your shoulder right now.

19:23.221 --> 19:27.223
IRVING:
I'm holding you
and rocking you back and forth.

19:27.241 --> 19:29.208
JESSICA:
Aw. Thank you.

We are in the midst

20:05.896 --> 20:08.372
public health crisis
of our lifetimes.

20:09.191 --> 20:10.041
Barrett, you can't be
doing surgeries

20:10.192 --> 20:11.542
that don't need to be done.

20:11.711 --> 20:14.045
You put a patient at risk
of getting COVID.

20:14.238 --> 20:17.030
20% of surgeries
are unnecessary.

20:17.091 --> 20:18.624
I made a judgment call.

20:18.718 --> 20:23.012
And he won't get COVID
because my OR is spotless.

20:26.842 --> 20:30.377
You know, you had a chance
to do the right thing.

20:30.438 --> 20:33.547
Pitch in with the rest of us
and help, but no.

20:33.608 --> 20:36.976
You just followed
Red Rock's marching orders.

20:37.128 --> 20:38.627
I'm a neurosurgeon. I cut.

20:38.646 --> 20:41.888
When that pandemic
can be cured by brain surgery,

20:41.950 --> 20:44.283
shoot me a page.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.065
HUNDLEY:
It's okay, Raylee.

20:52.126 --> 20:57.237
If you get a fever or cough,
don't panic.

20:57.257 --> 21:01.817
Most people don't get this sick.

21:01.919 --> 21:03.986
You're gonna be okay.

21:04.088 --> 21:06.764
My doctors are here.

21:06.957 --> 21:08.491
I'll call you back soon.

Proning isn't working, is it?

21:17.926 --> 21:20.427
BELL:
Well, your O2 sats
are still dipping too low,

21:20.488 --> 21:22.521
so we're gonna try
a high-flow nasal cannula now.

21:22.673 --> 21:24.264
CONRAD:
It is a little outside the box,

21:24.325 --> 21:28.101
but otherwise
we have to intubate.

21:28.162 --> 21:32.790
If you put me to sleep
and put that tube in,

21:32.983 --> 21:36.335
there's a good chance
I won't wake up again.

21:39.457 --> 21:42.049
Which is why high-flow
is worth the risk.

21:52.145 --> 21:54.127
Okay.

21:54.188 --> 21:56.722
On three. One, two, three.

21:56.858 --> 21:59.692

something.

-Haven't a clue.

White electrode...

22:15.877 --> 22:19.228
under right clavicle.

22:19.246 --> 22:21.488
Black under left.

22:21.549 --> 22:25.751
Red above and left of umbilicus.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.586
What about the beeping?

22:27.680 --> 22:29.013
Just press "silence."

22:31.684 --> 22:33.184
(beeping stops)

22:34.878 --> 22:37.262
Surgeons, huh?

22:37.357 --> 22:39.081
Nurses aren't paid enough.

22:39.183 --> 22:41.567
Tell me about it.
(coughing)

22:44.647 --> 22:45.921

22:45.981 --> 22:48.324
You're gonna be okay.

23:22.059 --> 23:23.292
Snapped when I was in the room.

23:23.352 --> 23:25.152
I thought I felt something.

23:28.557 --> 23:30.241
<i> CONRAD:</i>
<i> Europe, South Korea, China,</i>

23:30.434 --> 23:32.076
they all have state-of-the-art
protection; look at this.

23:32.269 --> 23:34.561
Dr. Voss is a surgeon.
Could have gone home

23:34.622 --> 23:36.305
'cause she doesn't have
any patients, but she's working

23:36.323 --> 23:37.748
in the ICU, and this is all
that protected her

23:37.900 --> 23:40.476
from exposure to COVID-19.
She's been exposed.

23:40.578 --> 23:42.978
You are sending our soldiers
to face the enemy

23:43.038 --> 23:45.238
without any armor.

23:45.258 --> 23:46.740
We have a top ER nurse
in the ICU

23:46.801 --> 23:48.500
fighting for her life.

23:48.594 --> 23:52.321
Two transpo workers are dead.
Med students, residents,

23:52.423 --> 23:54.156
they're isolating
from their families,

23:54.175 --> 23:55.507
they're sick and alone,
and some of them may die.

23:55.660 --> 23:57.101
Everybody is chasing
the same shipments.

23:57.252 --> 23:58.677
I keep getting outbid
by other hospitals.

23:58.829 --> 24:00.829
You need to protect our staff.
That's your job.

24:00.890 --> 24:02.923
I feel your frustration.
I-I do.

24:02.984 --> 24:05.017
My frustration? Why-why don't
you come down to my ER

24:05.153 --> 24:07.111
and share my frustration
instead of sitting

24:07.304 --> 24:09.429
in your ivory tower
doing nothing?!

24:09.490 --> 24:13.008
All of you think I don't care.
I care.

24:13.068 --> 24:15.602
I can't escape this either.

24:15.663 --> 24:17.863
This morning, a woman,
a total stranger,

24:18.015 --> 24:19.515
called me a bat eater.

24:19.575 --> 24:22.293
I'm sorry. That's terrible.

24:22.444 --> 24:24.687
The "China Virus,"
the "Kung Flu."

24:24.788 --> 24:26.797
I was born in Savannah.

24:26.949 --> 24:29.449
This is being used to turn us
all against each other.

24:29.510 --> 24:31.952
And yes, I am trying
to save this hospital.

24:32.013 --> 24:33.362
I'll-I'll bend the rules
to do it,

24:33.422 --> 24:34.955
but do not think for one moment

24:35.057 --> 24:37.582
that this hasn't hit me hard.

24:37.685 --> 24:39.477
I am human.

24:39.670 --> 24:42.021
Prove it.

24:45.526 --> 24:47.318
Prove it.

24:52.182 --> 24:55.234
(distant siren wailing)

24:55.328 --> 24:58.454
Yo. How you holding up?

25:00.666 --> 25:04.150
I don't know.
It's pretty rough in there.

25:04.212 --> 25:06.912
I'm proud of you for
working the ER;

25:07.064 --> 25:09.414
however, I need you in the OR.

25:09.509 --> 25:11.383
We have our first COVID trach.

25:13.796 --> 25:16.238
Sounds delightful.

25:16.298 --> 25:17.923
(both laugh)

25:18.059 --> 25:21.001
Well, seriously,
you could use the break.

25:21.062 --> 25:22.761
I'm worried about you.

25:22.855 --> 25:26.524
I'm worried about you, too.

25:30.887 --> 25:32.363
Okay.

25:32.514 --> 25:35.591
You know where to find me
if you need me.

25:35.609 --> 25:37.117
I certainly do.

25:43.400 --> 25:47.786
CONRAD:
The high-flow bought us time,
but...

25:47.938 --> 25:51.590
your sat is 82% on 100% oxygen,

25:51.717 --> 25:54.109
and it is dropping.

25:54.169 --> 25:56.554
We need to intubate.

25:56.722 --> 25:59.306
(stifled sobbing)

26:03.729 --> 26:07.122
-Can you get Chu?
-He's on his way.

26:07.224 --> 26:09.382
(Hundley crying)

26:09.443 --> 26:12.552
Can you please tell Raylee
I love her again?

26:12.572 --> 26:16.407
You will tell her yourself
because you will wake up.

26:16.558 --> 26:19.201
Now let us fight for you.

26:27.778 --> 26:30.963
-I'm here, Hundley. I'm here.
-(coughing)

26:32.800 --> 26:33.832
You're gonna be okay.

26:33.926 --> 26:37.136

-We're here.

26:39.923 --> 26:42.224
(sobbing softly)

26:48.316 --> 26:49.848
We're gonna put you to sleep
now, my friend.

26:49.942 --> 26:54.695
Just relax.
Just relax.

27:23.333 --> 27:27.019
-You haven't eaten all day.
-I can't eat.

27:30.191 --> 27:32.557
Hundley's a single mom.

27:32.693 --> 27:34.300
I don't want to have to
tell Raylee that

27:34.320 --> 27:35.986
she's never gonna see
her mom again.

27:39.216 --> 27:41.400
She's around the same age you
were when you lost your mom,

27:41.494 --> 27:43.285
isn't she?

27:50.652 --> 27:52.586
If you get COVID, I get COVID.

28:03.540 --> 28:05.849
The good news is
I can smell that coffee.

28:06.042 --> 28:07.743
And I could taste that bread.

28:07.761 --> 28:10.003
If it's my last meal,
I'm going out with carbs.

28:10.064 --> 28:12.231
Don't even say that.

28:14.919 --> 28:16.919
How's Kit?

28:16.979 --> 28:18.862
Her mask broke.

28:19.014 --> 28:21.448
She's been exposed.

28:23.351 --> 28:25.518
-(sighs)
-I told her to go home.

28:25.621 --> 28:28.122
She's scared.

28:34.755 --> 28:37.197
(Mina chuckles)

28:37.258 --> 28:40.776
You'd rather wear a PAPR
than shave your beard.

28:40.836 --> 28:44.370
(chuckles) You know how long
it takes to grow this beard out?

28:44.390 --> 28:46.056
You know we have
a limited number of these?

28:46.208 --> 28:47.616
They're for people who can't
wear N95s because of the way

28:47.634 --> 28:49.634
their faces are shaped,
or because they have

28:49.729 --> 28:51.453
a religious objection
to shaving their beards.

28:51.555 --> 28:54.139
Yeah, well, let's just say
I do have a religious objection.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.458
I worship this beard, all right?

28:56.477 --> 28:58.885
Well, you certainly are
conceited as you are vain.

28:58.988 --> 29:00.220
Isn't it itchy?

29:00.281 --> 29:02.573
Not at all.

29:04.744 --> 29:06.985
-All right, let me help you.
-Aw, thanks.

29:07.079 --> 29:08.728
Without the beard,
I look too young.

29:08.789 --> 29:10.730
It adds wisdom and gravitas,

29:10.791 --> 29:12.624
-and it's reassuring
to my patients.
-Mm.

29:18.466 --> 29:21.091
(laughs) Well, you don't
look reassuring to me.

29:21.243 --> 29:23.335
-You look like you're
about to go into space.
-Ha-ha-ha-ha.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.471

29:28.258 --> 29:30.100

29:32.254 --> 29:33.437

29:35.274 --> 29:38.650
Yeah, it is.

29:56.912 --> 29:58.854

South Korea.

30:00.624 --> 30:02.633

relatives there.

30:02.826 --> 30:04.784
I put in an emergency order,

30:04.845 --> 30:07.787
and it turns out this shipment
was on its way.

30:07.848 --> 30:10.957
-It wasn't cheap getting it
diverted to Chastain.
-Wait, wait, wait.

30:11.060 --> 30:14.061
-You said Red Rock wouldn't pay.
-They won't.

30:15.147 --> 30:17.356
But they did.

30:20.677 --> 30:22.377
(sighs)

30:22.437 --> 30:24.304
What happens when they find out?

30:24.365 --> 30:27.049
Could cost me my job.

30:27.067 --> 30:30.569
But for now, at least our staff
will be protected.

to take a moment

35:43.350 --> 35:46.476

that are missing here today.

35:46.669 --> 35:48.979
People we worked with
for a very long time...

35:50.315 --> 35:53.650

their battle with COVID.

35:55.678 --> 35:57.320
George in transpo.

35:59.032 --> 36:00.282
Dr. Peterson.

36:01.326 --> 36:04.143
Peter who cleaned the ICU rooms.

36:04.163 --> 36:07.238
Lois from accounting.

36:07.332 --> 36:10.241
They ate lunch together
every day.

36:10.335 --> 36:12.544

36:14.339 --> 36:17.081

We also want to send love
to our dear friend Devon,

36:19.202 --> 36:21.736
who was to be my best man.

36:21.796 --> 36:24.347
Devon...

36:27.019 --> 36:28.935
...lost his father
to COVID-19...

36:30.305 --> 36:32.355
...and he almost lost
his mother.

36:34.142 --> 36:36.860
He's on his way
to his dad's memorial right now.

36:37.053 --> 36:38.278
Dad?

36:40.199 --> 36:41.923
Thank you for stepping in
as my best man.

36:42.025 --> 36:43.408
I love you.

Let us honor the lives
of those we've lost,

36:52.568 --> 36:55.712
by holding their memories
in our hearts

36:55.905 --> 36:59.049
as we celebrate
one of life's greatest joys.

37:04.056 --> 37:07.390
Tough times come.
They always will.

37:07.559 --> 37:12.454

I want you by my side.

I promise to always
have your back,

37:19.988 --> 37:21.053
no matter what.

37:21.114 --> 37:23.889
I promise to love you,

37:23.951 --> 37:25.967
-but to never obey you.
-(laughter)

37:25.986 --> 37:29.621

37:30.749 --> 37:32.991
Mostly...

37:33.126 --> 37:36.419
I promise you'll never lose me.

37:36.612 --> 37:37.712
This is forever.

shall live.

Conrad Theodore Hawkins

38:01.822 --> 38:03.688
and Nicolette Marie Nevin,

38:03.824 --> 38:05.264
sounds to me like
you take each other

38:05.325 --> 38:07.266
as lawfully wedded
husband and wife.

38:07.286 --> 38:09.861
-BOTH: We do.

Then by the power vested in me
by the city of Atlanta

38:12.958 --> 38:17.352

I hereby declare it official.

38:17.454 --> 38:20.255
You may now enjoy your first
kiss as husband and wife.
