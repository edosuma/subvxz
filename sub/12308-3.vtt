WEBVTT

00:03.756 --> 00:05.876
Praise the gods,
you've finally arrived

00:06.267 --> 00:09.894
and you are far more beautiful
than I ever could have imagined.

00:09.950 --> 00:11.307
Excuse me?

00:11.703 --> 00:14.232
You have not come for
the arranged marriage?

00:14.437 --> 00:15.367
No.

00:16.408 --> 00:18.752
- Would you perhaps be seeking a husband?
- No.

00:20.811 --> 00:22.875
Then what brings you to our town?

00:22.921 --> 00:25.445
We've heard of strangers
who recently arrived

00:25.480 --> 00:28.445
a rough-looking group,
boasting of many wraith kills?

00:28.572 --> 00:30.318
Yeah, we think they
might be satedan.

00:30.509 --> 00:34.628
Ah, yes, you mean the three loud-mouthed drunkards
who spend their days carousing at the tavern?

00:34.743 --> 00:36.612
Sounds like my people.

00:36.692 --> 00:38.796
****

00:38.843 --> 00:41.462
- Thank you.
- You are most welcome

00:41.519 --> 00:45.126
and should you ever reconsider
your desire for a husband...

00:46.988 --> 00:49.583
all right, I'll check the
inn, you check the tavern

00:49.836 --> 00:50.979
Sounds good

01:07.531 --> 01:08.590
Hello

01:09.388 --> 01:12.519
I'm looking for three
individuals who recently arrived.

01:12.571 --> 01:16.520
I've heard they are voracious
eaters and drinkers, and

01:16.734 --> 01:20.710
apparently, they've been quite vocal about
their recent successes against the wraith

01:20.790 --> 01:22.445
These people you're looking for...

01:24.525 --> 01:27.890
they're either very
brave, or very stupid.

01:28.176 --> 01:29.414
How so?

01:29.779 --> 01:31.255
Well

01:31.363 --> 01:33.517
if word of their bragging
got back to the wraith

01:33.752 --> 01:35.442
it could be very bad for them

01:35.736 --> 01:39.260
I doubt they need to fear a wraith
overhearing their conversation.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.574
Of course not

01:40.753 --> 01:43.741
but the wraith don't always
need their own ears to hear.

01:45.583 --> 01:47.832
Do you know the people whom I seek?

01:48.234 --> 01:49.162
Sorry

01:49.329 --> 01:50.746
I mind my own business

01:50.968 --> 01:54.432
which is something you
might want to consider

01:55.616 --> 01:57.556
And you might want
to consider offering

01:57.568 --> 02:02.814
your unsolicited advice to someone
who actually cares to receive it

02:05.903 --> 02:08.304
An attitude like that
could get you hurt

02:08.399 --> 02:09.744
or worse

02:22.758 --> 02:24.175
What's the first to go?

02:24.263 --> 02:27.501
The ears, or those pretty eyes?

02:27.894 --> 02:29.358
How about your head?

02:34.157 --> 02:35.074
Ronon!

02:35.098 --> 02:36.205
Ara, rakai!

02:47.920 --> 02:49.134
Hmm, heard the rumor?

02:49.170 --> 02:49.967
No, what rumor?

02:49.968 --> 02:51.277
Never mind. Forget I mentioned it.

02:51.420 --> 02:52.920
Wait. What is this about?

02:53.050 --> 02:55.424
No, it would be irresponsible
for me to say anything.

02:55.591 --> 02:59.055
All right, look, if you're going to twist my
arm, the I.O.A. Have made their final decision.

02:59.477 --> 03:01.489
They've chosen the
new leader of atlantis.

03:02.024 --> 03:02.810
Well, who is it?

03:02.834 --> 03:04.786
Well, there's been no
formal announcement, but

03:04.854 --> 03:07.747
word is, they're going with their
foremost expert in ancient technology

03:07.803 --> 03:09.267
and replicator activity

03:09.374 --> 03:10.695
Who does that sound like to you?

03:12.676 --> 03:14.593
- You?
- Yes. Who else?

03:14.772 --> 03:17.105
Well, I heard they were leaning toward
someone with a science background-

03:17.106 --> 03:20.280
and why not? It's about time that one of
us ended up in a position of real power.

03:20.281 --> 03:23.193
Oh, oh, and by "us,"
you mean "you. "

03:23.264 --> 03:24.609
Exactly.

03:25.186 --> 03:26.281
It's kind of scary, though.

03:26.282 --> 03:28.563
You know, I'll be making decisions
that don't affect just the city,

03:28.575 --> 03:29.908
but the entire galaxy.

03:29.932 --> 03:31.027
Yes, scary.

03:31.063 --> 03:32.730
- Very scary
- On the other hand

03:32.872 --> 03:34.587
a leader never
second-guesses himself.

03:34.723 --> 03:36.199
I'm up for the challenge.

03:36.377 --> 03:37.294
I know I am.

03:37.350 --> 03:38.493
I'm going to make them proud.

03:38.494 --> 03:40.493
Radek, I'm going to make you proud.

03:43.509 --> 03:45.831
The wraith-replicator
war is in full swing.

03:45.832 --> 03:49.485
From what I hear, the replicators are kicking
some serious ass in their last offensive.

03:49.660 --> 03:51.291
That's good news, john. Well done.

03:51.356 --> 03:54.379
- Hey!
- I'll have the reports ready for you.

03:54.558 --> 03:55.272
Sam!

03:55.332 --> 03:57.879
Uh... what's new?

03:57.979 --> 04:00.586
Just making preparations for
the change in command here.

04:00.587 --> 04:01.916
You don't have to tell
me. I already know.

04:02.059 --> 04:02.702
Really?

04:02.785 --> 04:06.814
I just want to say that I think the
I.O.A. Could not have made a better choice.

04:07.433 --> 04:08.266
Thanks, rodney.

04:08.267 --> 04:10.373
No, no, no, no, you are too kind.

04:10.421 --> 04:11.703
What?

04:13.330 --> 04:14.854
Uh... "thank you, rodney. "

04:14.937 --> 04:16.414
No, no, wait a
minute. You mean the...

04:16.481 --> 04:19.993
yeah. She's our new boss.

04:30.907 --> 04:36.014
Stargate Atlantis

04:36.221 --> 04:41.959
Season 04

04:42.066 --> 04:46.995
Episode 03

05:32.973 --> 05:34.675
<font color

05:34.676 --> 05:35.854
I thought you guys were dead.

05:35.901 --> 05:37.267
Believe me, so did we.

05:37.338 --> 05:40.267
How did you manage to survive
the wraith attack on sateda?

05:40.311 --> 05:41.382
We weren't there.

05:41.450 --> 05:43.105
I don't understand.

05:43.188 --> 05:45.605
When we first made the decision
to fight back against the wraith,

05:45.652 --> 05:47.795
we didn't just wait
for them to come to us.

05:47.982 --> 05:50.558
We started running ops against
some of their known strongholds.

05:50.606 --> 05:51.808
They were quick strikes.

05:51.844 --> 05:53.332
Get in, hit 'em hard, get out.

05:53.463 --> 05:56.475
Only on this particular occasion, we
kind of messed up the getting out part.

05:56.658 --> 05:58.777
I saw the darts hit your position.

05:59.230 --> 06:02.408
What you didn't see was that we'd found
a network of caves in the hillside.

06:02.532 --> 06:03.663
When the wraith attacked

06:03.758 --> 06:05.615
the entrance collapsed,
and we were sealed in.

06:05.921 --> 06:08.064
It took us three days
to dig our way out.

06:08.088 --> 06:10.135
And by then, the place
was crawling with them.

06:10.299 --> 06:12.608
It was obvious they were
gearing up for an attack.

06:12.926 --> 06:16.033
Took another two weeks before we could find
our way through the gate, and by then...

06:16.375 --> 06:17.339
it was too late.

06:17.422 --> 06:20.240
When we got back to sateda,
there was nothing left.

06:20.561 --> 06:21.758
I'm sorry.

06:21.928 --> 06:23.640
I should have never
left you behind.

06:24.239 --> 06:25.998
Don't be an idiot, ronon.

06:26.168 --> 06:27.799
When you took second
squad back to the gate,

06:27.800 --> 06:29.989
you had no way of knowing those
darts were going to come through

06:30.060 --> 06:31.092
And if we'd have gone back with you

06:31.104 --> 06:34.740
then we would have died in the attack
on sateda along with everybody else.

06:35.602 --> 06:37.690
The only reason why you survived

06:37.854 --> 06:39.661
was because they made you a runner.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.092
You heard about that?

06:43.291 --> 06:45.368
A while back, we
started hearing stories.

06:45.369 --> 06:48.931
They said you were seven feet tall
and had the strength of five men.

06:48.942 --> 06:50.538
People like to exaggerate.

06:50.778 --> 06:53.077
They also said you
killed a hundred wraith.

06:53.171 --> 06:54.473
That part sounds about right.

06:57.646 --> 06:59.007
Well, then...

06:59.098 --> 07:00.881
to the misery of our enemies

07:01.362 --> 07:02.945
and the reunion of friends

07:03.001 --> 07:04.057
come back from the dead.

07:04.092 --> 07:05.077
Oh, yeah.

07:12.192 --> 07:13.447
On the day I left chulak

07:13.482 --> 07:15.359
master bratac said to me

07:15.875 --> 07:17.377
"draw from your past

07:17.482 --> 07:19.664
but do not let your
past draw from you. "

07:20.318 --> 07:21.907
That's good advice.

07:22.658 --> 07:24.676
Still, I know I'm going
to miss this place,

07:24.734 --> 07:26.069
and all of you.

07:26.585 --> 07:29.588
I would have been offended
had you felt otherwise.

07:30.638 --> 07:32.514
10 years is a long time.

07:32.667 --> 07:35.330
It has been 10 years well spent.

07:35.632 --> 07:38.658
We have defeated numerous
enemies and overcome many threats.

07:38.805 --> 07:40.564
It was never dull.

07:40.623 --> 07:42.594
We have accomplished much here

07:42.781 --> 07:45.509
but now it is atlantis
that is in need of you.

07:46.294 --> 07:47.303
Yeah...

07:47.362 --> 07:49.814
part of me is looking
forward to going, but...

07:50.327 --> 07:52.250
you know, there's a part of me
that thinks maybe it's too soon,

07:52.251 --> 07:54.890
that I'm leaving my
work here unfinished.

07:55.154 --> 07:56.737
Your work will continue

07:56.913 --> 07:58.872
only in a different place

07:59.318 --> 08:02.520
You have been bestowed an
incredible honor, colonel carter,

08:03.312 --> 08:05.400
and I believe you
should embrace it.

08:06.391 --> 08:07.940
And know this...

08:08.245 --> 08:10.450
though we may not
be leaving with you,

08:10.752 --> 08:13.790
sg-1 will never be far away.

08:14.866 --> 08:17.693
So I can expect you guys
to come and visit sometime?

08:18.136 --> 08:20.764
Undomesticated equines
could not keep me away.

08:24.720 --> 08:26.785
Nice call-back.

08:28.661 --> 08:30.216
Indeed

08:37.481 --> 08:38.688
All right.

08:41.232 --> 08:42.732
Time to go.

08:53.893 --> 08:54.702
What's that?

08:54.703 --> 08:57.071
It's a selection of fruits from
the various worlds we trade with.

08:57.632 --> 08:58.828
I thought it'd be thoughtful.

08:58.829 --> 09:00.060
Try lame.

09:00.761 --> 09:02.567
Really, and what would you suggest?

09:02.576 --> 09:04.042
You know, maybe some flowers.

09:04.066 --> 09:05.696
You could brighten up her quarters.

09:05.752 --> 09:07.441
Oh, flowers.

09:07.652 --> 09:10.796
Here, take this, and go.

09:26.632 --> 09:28.075
Colonel carter

09:28.076 --> 09:29.377
welcome to atlantis.

09:29.436 --> 09:30.128
Thank you.

09:30.187 --> 09:32.286
It's nice to be here.

09:34.744 --> 09:39.037
I want you all to know how honored
I am to accept this appointment.

09:39.266 --> 09:42.222
I've come here fully
committed to this expedition,

09:42.442 --> 09:46.231
to atlantis, and most importantly,
to each and every one of you.

09:46.650 --> 09:48.738
I look forward to
working with all of you.

09:49.019 --> 09:50.861
Thank you.

09:51.676 --> 09:52.756
Nice speech.

09:52.896 --> 09:54.210
Thank you.

09:54.313 --> 09:56.987
I also do weddings and award shows.

09:57.219 --> 09:59.682
Book early to avoid disappointment.

09:59.882 --> 10:01.899
Should we go check
out your new digs?

10:01.900 --> 10:03.266
Yeah

10:03.782 --> 10:04.814
Rodney...

10:04.826 --> 10:05.624
sam...

10:20.521 --> 10:21.612
Stings, doesn't it?

10:23.158 --> 10:25.093
What the hell have the three of
you been doing all these years?

10:25.175 --> 10:25.773
Oh

10:25.841 --> 10:28.856
eating, drinking

10:29.381 --> 10:30.436
killing wraith

10:30.636 --> 10:32.630
We've hit 'em more
times than I can count.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.032
Racked up a pretty nice body count.

10:35.033 --> 10:37.237
Not to mention the
12 darts we've downed.

10:37.454 --> 10:40.668
we're armed, mobile, and,
occasionally, get good intel.

10:40.738 --> 10:42.815
Well, sounds like
a pretty nice run.

10:43.034 --> 10:45.369
But there have been
a few sacrifices.

10:45.589 --> 10:46.738
Yeah? What do you mean?

10:48.921 --> 10:51.748
There were five of us who
came out of that cave alive...

10:52.428 --> 10:55.502
but we lost marika on the
first assault against the wraith

10:56.176 --> 10:57.290
and then hemi last year.

10:58.358 --> 10:59.824
It hasn't been easy.

11:02.387 --> 11:04.862
We don't have much to
work with, but we make do.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.267
Sometimes, it's not enough.

11:08.689 --> 11:10.038
Yeah, well, I might
be able to help.

11:10.226 --> 11:12.044
We've got the
manpower, the equipment.

11:12.115 --> 11:13.593
My friends and I, we can...

11:19.425 --> 11:21.443
anyway, um...

11:21.842 --> 11:23.754
to marika and hemi.

11:24.456 --> 11:27.717
To marika and hemi.

11:35.667 --> 11:36.922
Thank you

11:38.515 --> 11:39.969
Hey, rodney. Come on in.

11:40.213 --> 11:43.157
I brought you a little
something to spruce up the place.

11:43.274 --> 11:45.081
Well, thank you. That's very sweet.

11:45.183 --> 11:47.389
There's a vase right there.

11:54.742 --> 11:56.666
Oh, colonel sheppard
dropped that off.

11:56.736 --> 12:01.663
Apparently, it's a sampling of fruit from the
home worlds of our various trading partners.

12:01.962 --> 12:05.000
I thought it was a
really thoughtful gesture.

12:05.877 --> 12:07.906
son of A...

12:08.326 --> 12:09.170
anyway

12:09.205 --> 12:12.384
look, I just... I just came
by to welcome you to atlantis,

12:12.388 --> 12:14.218
see how you're settling in, and

12:14.288 --> 12:17.930
you know, if you needed anything, and
did I mention I was seeing someone?

12:18.458 --> 12:19.397
I'm sorry, what?

12:19.511 --> 12:21.130
I'm, uh, seeing someone.

12:21.294 --> 12:23.675
Yes, I only bring it up
now because you're here

12:23.713 --> 12:25.942
now and we'll be working
together a lot more, and

12:26.007 --> 12:28.282
you know, I just
thought with our past...

12:28.526 --> 12:29.687
our past?

12:29.778 --> 12:34.036
Well, you know, the unrequited lust that's been
hanging over our heads for what seems like forever.

12:34.640 --> 12:35.168
Rodney-

12:35.169 --> 12:38.687
I just don't want things to be awkward
between the two of us, you know?

12:42.036 --> 12:43.514
kind of like they are now.

12:46.831 --> 12:48.098
Rodney...

12:48.928 --> 12:51.274
I'm sure we'll be fine.

12:51.376 --> 12:53.546
Oh, of course. I mean,
I'll be fine. I'm just...

12:53.625 --> 12:55.948
- with you...
- I hear you're in charge.

12:57.282 --> 12:59.851
ronon, this is colonel carter.
Sam, this is ronon. He's-

12:59.852 --> 13:00.966
satedan

13:01.021 --> 13:02.969
and a member of
your team. Of course.

13:02.970 --> 13:04.878
What can I do for you?

13:05.722 --> 13:08.936
I want to bring some friends to atlantis, and,
apparently, I've got to clear it through you first.

13:09.048 --> 13:11.417
Unfortunately, some
new security procedures

13:11.418 --> 13:14.854
prevent me from allowing any off-world
visits to atlantis for the time being.

13:15.133 --> 13:16.353
On whose authority?

13:16.737 --> 13:18.496
It was a directive from the I.O.A.

13:18.658 --> 13:19.913
Well, they don't need to know.

13:19.933 --> 13:21.494
Ronon, she's-

13:21.693 --> 13:25.458
I'm sure you understand what a
precarious position we're in here.

13:25.631 --> 13:28.831
It is imperative that the location
of this base remain a secret.

13:28.842 --> 13:29.957
And it will.

13:29.980 --> 13:32.039
They're my people.
I'll vouch for them.

13:32.227 --> 13:33.634
I'm sure you can,

13:33.681 --> 13:37.083
but for now, we're on a new
planet with a new set of rules.

13:37.256 --> 13:39.649
And a new person in charge.

13:43.499 --> 13:45.411
Weir never would've doubted me.

13:46.253 --> 13:48.494
Okay, first of all, ronon,

13:48.495 --> 13:49.983
I'm not doubting you.

13:50.230 --> 13:53.526
These new regulations apply
to everyone on this base,

13:54.024 --> 13:55.279
and secondly...

13:56.848 --> 13:58.840
I'm not dr. Weir.

14:09.058 --> 14:10.419
Is he always like that?

14:10.736 --> 14:12.425
No, no...

14:12.578 --> 14:15.405
no, actually, you
caught him on a good day.

14:16.865 --> 14:17.780
Okay.

14:17.918 --> 14:20.569
Try it together, and turn!

14:21.141 --> 14:23.405
Work on it.

14:23.475 --> 14:24.495
well, that was fast.

14:24.575 --> 14:26.428
Yeah, I said it would be.

14:26.803 --> 14:28.141
You could have taken your time.

14:28.302 --> 14:29.487
We like it here.

14:29.616 --> 14:31.317
We're thinking of staying
on a few more days.

14:31.443 --> 14:33.273
Then where will you go?

14:34.654 --> 14:35.897
Wherever

14:36.281 --> 14:38.686
That's one of the nice things
about not being tied down.

14:39.437 --> 14:40.657
You go where you want,

14:40.715 --> 14:43.009
and you leave when
you're not wanted.

14:43.466 --> 14:46.833
Yeah, well, I was hoping my people would
show a little bit more hospitality, but...

14:46.888 --> 14:47.815
don't worry about it.

14:47.850 --> 14:49.246
I understand.

14:49.598 --> 14:53.114
Not everybody gets an
invitation to atlantis.

14:55.633 --> 14:57.487
Don't look so surprised.

14:58.595 --> 15:00.847
You travel as much around
this galaxy as we do

15:00.927 --> 15:04.797
and sooner or later, you'll start hearing rumors
about new people in the city of the ancients

15:05.146 --> 15:06.894
and the runner who joined 'em.

15:08.132 --> 15:09.493
Man, I'm sorry.

15:09.727 --> 15:11.698
I wish I could've been straight
with you from the start.

15:12.363 --> 15:13.971
They placed their trust in you,

15:14.076 --> 15:15.742
and you proved them worthy.

15:15.859 --> 15:17.325
I wouldn't have expected any less.

15:17.331 --> 15:19.032
- Yeah, but
still- - what

15:19.407 --> 15:21.660
you thought they'd make an
exception because it was you asking?

15:21.683 --> 15:23.806
- I'm supposed to be
their friend- - no.

15:24.774 --> 15:26.135
You're their ally.

15:26.205 --> 15:27.484
Their guest.

15:27.906 --> 15:30.123
Me, rakai, and ara,
we're your friends.

15:31.569 --> 15:33.258
I don't doubt they're good people.

15:33.610 --> 15:34.841
They helped you out
when you needed it

15:34.842 --> 15:37.387
and from what I hear, they've done
more to hurt the wraith than anyone.

15:37.399 --> 15:39.141
You've got to respect that

15:39.551 --> 15:42.073
but it doesn't mean you've
got to commit to them.

15:44.020 --> 15:45.498
The way I see it,

15:45.856 --> 15:48.014
now that we're back together...

15:48.856 --> 15:51.050
you belong with us.

15:58.031 --> 15:59.732
Pretty impressive, isn't it?

16:00.060 --> 16:02.219
To be honest, it's a
little overwhelming.

16:02.524 --> 16:05.644
Coming from somebody with your
record, that says something.

16:07.374 --> 16:10.049
You know, john, your name
was on the short list.

16:10.773 --> 16:12.063
Yeah, I know.

16:12.433 --> 16:14.110
I saw what they did to elizabeth,

16:14.145 --> 16:16.644
the politics and the red
tape. I didn't envy her.

16:16.773 --> 16:18.673
I don't envy you.

16:18.882 --> 16:20.418
Thanks.

16:21.799 --> 16:24.110
You know, for most of us,

16:24.111 --> 16:27.275
this thing with
elizabeth isn't over yet.

16:28.430 --> 16:30.119
She's still out there.

16:30.694 --> 16:32.876
You really believe there's
a chance she's still alive?

16:32.993 --> 16:34.987
There's only one
way to know for sure.

16:35.005 --> 16:36.870
You're suggesting we go back?

16:38.090 --> 16:39.685
We should have done it sooner

16:39.686 --> 16:42.134
but the I.O.A.'S
been stonewalling me.

16:42.483 --> 16:45.063
Now that you're in charge, maybe
you can give me the green light.

16:45.659 --> 16:47.536
I'm sorry, but it's too dangerous.

16:47.764 --> 16:49.582
It's no more dangerous than
the last time we went in.

16:49.653 --> 16:52.937
Circumstances were different. Plus, you had
an advantage then that you don't have now.

16:53.005 --> 16:55.198
Well, she's the one who
gave us that advantage.

16:55.222 --> 16:57.345
The only reason we're here
is because of what she did.

16:57.357 --> 16:58.858
Believe me, I know

16:59.184 --> 17:02.327
and I don't like the idea of leaving
someone behind any more than you do

17:02.568 --> 17:05.945
but I'm not about to send you or
anyone else on a suicide mission.

17:06.224 --> 17:09.521
Now, you come to me with a plan that has
an even an outside chance of succeeding

17:09.521 --> 17:11.028
and I'll consider it.

17:11.181 --> 17:13.455
Short of that, john, I'm sorry.

17:13.711 --> 17:15.435
There's nothing I can do.

17:16.996 --> 17:18.568
Fair enough.

17:41.860 --> 17:43.268
You seem distracted today.

17:43.291 --> 17:45.121
Oh, no, I'm fine.

17:45.693 --> 17:48.156
- What's wrong?
- There's nothing. I told you, I'm fine.

17:48.573 --> 17:52.467
Very well. I suppose we
should just continue training.

17:54.963 --> 17:55.960
There's nothing!

17:57.086 --> 17:59.279
Okay, stop hitting me!

17:59.555 --> 18:02.218
God... I'll talk.

18:07.245 --> 18:09.544
I'm thinking of leaving atlantis.

18:12.916 --> 18:14.828
Where would you go?

18:15.870 --> 18:20.116
Must it come down to a choice between
atlantis and your satedan friends?

18:20.207 --> 18:23.175
They're more than my friends,
teyla. They're my family.

18:23.805 --> 18:25.999
We've always been
there for each other.

18:26.277 --> 18:27.415
You wouldn't understand.

18:27.485 --> 18:29.163
I disagree.

18:29.875 --> 18:33.054
Leaving my fellow athosians
for a home here on atlantis

18:33.107 --> 18:35.570
was a very difficult decision.

18:36.157 --> 18:37.893
I was their leader.

18:38.092 --> 18:39.066
For some

18:39.084 --> 18:40.890
the only leader they'd ever known

18:40.902 --> 18:44.292
and despite the fact that I was as
close as a trip through the stargate

18:44.293 --> 18:48.773
there were moments when
I felt I'd betrayed them.

18:50.128 --> 18:52.204
- So what? You got over it?
- No.

18:52.937 --> 18:56.292
I sometimes still
second-guess my decision

18:56.840 --> 19:00.899
then I remember that I can
do more here to help my people

19:00.931 --> 19:02.820
and the rest of
humans in this galaxy

19:02.821 --> 19:05.670
than I ever could on my home world.

19:19.995 --> 19:21.977
Teyla's already spoken
to you, hasn't she?

19:22.071 --> 19:23.631
Yeah, well, we had a little chat.

19:24.042 --> 19:25.027
So let's hear it.

19:25.180 --> 19:26.306
Hear what?

19:26.350 --> 19:27.957
Whatever you've got to say.

19:28.027 --> 19:29.599
- Not going to say anything.
- Really?

19:29.913 --> 19:33.367
I don't have to, because you already
know what I'm going to tell you.

19:33.403 --> 19:35.068
That you're a valuable
member of my team

19:35.069 --> 19:37.931
and that it would be difficult to
find somebody to take your place.

19:37.939 --> 19:41.491
And that you may think you're going
back to find something you've lost,

19:42.309 --> 19:43.951
but there's nothing to go back to.

19:43.998 --> 19:47.306
Sateda is gone, and living on the run with
your buddies isn't going to bring that back.

19:47.667 --> 19:48.922
You're not going
to say any of that?

19:48.923 --> 19:50.411
I don't have to.

19:50.549 --> 19:52.696
Look, this isn't about me
trying to bring back the past.

19:52.731 --> 19:53.787
Well, then what is it?

19:53.819 --> 19:55.180
They need me.

19:55.306 --> 19:57.101
They always have.

19:57.262 --> 19:58.611
I'm the one that took care of them,

19:58.612 --> 20:00.957
got them home alive
whenever we went into battle.

20:04.667 --> 20:06.086
You're one man, ronon.

20:06.087 --> 20:09.065
You can't expect to
protect them forever.

20:09.406 --> 20:11.282
Probably not...

20:11.787 --> 20:13.734
but that's where you guys come in.

20:15.030 --> 20:17.423
We got some intel on araith target.

20:19.145 --> 20:22.476
The wraith and the replicators are kind of
beating the crap out of each other right now.

20:22.477 --> 20:25.453
I think it's counter-productive
to run an op against them.

20:25.708 --> 20:29.197
I have a feeling you'll change
your mind once you hear the details.

20:31.321 --> 20:32.529
Let's hear it.

20:32.634 --> 20:33.854
Not yet.

20:34.004 --> 20:36.960
I want tyre, ara,
and rakai in on this.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.552
You want to hit a wraith lab?

20:44.259 --> 20:46.992
No offense, but
that's awfully close to

20:47.016 --> 20:48.869
crazy talk territory

20:49.063 --> 20:51.174
It's a weapons research facility.

20:51.397 --> 20:53.802
From what we've heard,
the place is undermanned

20:54.303 --> 20:56.731
We know the wraith are being
attacked on several fronts.

20:56.890 --> 20:59.822
They don't have the resources anymore
to properly guard all their facilities.

20:59.823 --> 21:02.849
Still, she did say, "undermanned"
rather than "unmanned. "

21:02.850 --> 21:04.385
There is a big difference.

21:04.394 --> 21:06.412
It won't matter. We can handle it.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.552
Then why do you need
our help to pull it off?

21:08.799 --> 21:10.593
We don'T.

21:11.822 --> 21:14.145
But we will need your help
to get away once we're done.

21:14.247 --> 21:15.127
I see.

21:15.303 --> 21:18.177
We're your designated drivers.

21:24.445 --> 21:25.606
This is our target.

21:25.735 --> 21:28.691
It's located a good half day's
journey from the gate on foot.

21:29.049 --> 21:33.635
Having a ship would make things a whole lot easier
getting us in and out before any reinforcements arrive.

21:34.122 --> 21:36.116
Don't worry. All
you got to do is fly.

21:36.234 --> 21:37.594
We'll do the legwork.

21:37.712 --> 21:41.277
Well, that's very considerate
of you, but if we commit,

21:41.732 --> 21:42.905
we're all in.

21:43.034 --> 21:44.852
And I really don't
see why we would.

21:44.905 --> 21:48.530
I mean, sure it would be great to get
our hands on some new wraith tech, but

21:48.723 --> 21:51.879
maybe if we stumbled across a stockpile,
or maybe bought some off of ebay, but-

21:51.880 --> 21:53.978
I think what he's trying to say is,

21:54.034 --> 21:57.236
we're not really sure if we want to
risk our lives for something like this.

21:57.456 --> 21:59.474
Maybe wait a month or two

21:59.495 --> 22:02.709
let the replicators and the
wraith soften each other up

22:02.744 --> 22:04.961
then we do lunch, we
talk about it again.

22:05.107 --> 22:09.213
One of the things they're working on right now in the
lab is a way to switch off the replicator attack code.

22:13.230 --> 22:14.884
Is such a thing even possible?

22:14.989 --> 22:16.631
The code's been
deactivated once before.

22:16.632 --> 22:18.532
The wraith may have
done it the first time.

22:18.567 --> 22:19.857
Well, we can't let it happen.

22:19.933 --> 22:20.837
No.

22:21.118 --> 22:22.620
If the war with the
replicators ends,

22:22.643 --> 22:27.153
then the wraith will once again be able to
direct their attention to the rest of the galaxy.

22:28.655 --> 22:30.250
So...

22:32.068 --> 22:33.441
are you in?

22:36.925 --> 22:39.634
Your buddies seem like a
perfectly capable enough bunch

22:39.635 --> 22:41.406
but if I do this, the
last thing I need is

22:41.407 --> 22:43.541
someone going off half-cocked
and risking this op

22:43.561 --> 22:45.590
and, well, oh, yeah, our asses.

22:45.599 --> 22:47.464
This isn't their first
time doing this, john.

22:47.919 --> 22:49.467
May be the first time
doing it with company

22:49.488 --> 22:51.939
though, and I don't want it
turning into a big pissing match

22:51.963 --> 22:53.898
Yeah, well, I'll keep my group
in line. Do the same for yours.

22:53.945 --> 22:55.951
Last time I checked,
it was your group, too.

22:59.403 --> 23:00.505
Yeah...

23:01.479 --> 23:03.567
look, I was going to
wait to tell you this,

23:03.848 --> 23:06.288
but I've made my decision.

23:06.620 --> 23:08.309
Once we finish this op

23:08.473 --> 23:10.714
I'm going to be leaving atlantis.

23:28.472 --> 23:29.903
Come on in.

23:35.432 --> 23:36.593
Packing?

23:38.423 --> 23:39.291
Yeah

23:40.074 --> 23:44.250
You know, the fact that you brought all this stuff
here tells me that you considered atlantis home

23:44.400 --> 23:45.514
that you were happy here

23:45.596 --> 23:47.274
Yeah, well, I was.

23:47.379 --> 23:48.505
I am.

23:49.415 --> 23:51.643
Your friends are worried about you.

23:52.145 --> 23:54.878
Well, they shouldn't be.
I can take care of myself.

23:55.133 --> 23:56.834
That's not the point.

23:57.324 --> 24:00.725
When you accepted the offer to join
atlantis, you became a part of something

24:01.212 --> 24:03.382
and, like it or not,
you have roots here now

24:03.453 --> 24:06.198
people who care about
you, who depend on you

24:06.538 --> 24:09.429
Walking away may be a
lot harder than you think.

24:10.074 --> 24:11.529
Oh, I'm not walking away.

24:11.678 --> 24:13.591
Just because I'm not a part of
sheppard's team does not mean

24:13.592 --> 24:16.828
I'm any less willing to help out atlantis,
or put my life on the line for any of you.

24:17.022 --> 24:19.215
I'm not questioning
your loyalty, ronon,

24:19.588 --> 24:23.752
only the wisdom in leaving, if, as you say,
you don't want to turn your back on atlantis.

24:24.312 --> 24:27.420
Coordinating our efforts with you
and your friends may not be so easy.

24:28.567 --> 24:30.186
We're about to find out, aren't we?

24:32.373 --> 24:34.860
I need you to reconsider
your decision to leave.

24:35.702 --> 24:37.461
And if I don't,

24:37.670 --> 24:40.121
given everything that
I know about atlantis

24:41.294 --> 24:42.831
you going to try and stop me?

24:45.816 --> 24:48.045
I'm hoping it won't come to that.

24:56.599 --> 24:58.359
Put us down near the south end.

24:58.368 --> 25:01.148
We'll meet less resistance if we
access this place through the back.

25:01.177 --> 25:02.350
Got it.

25:02.948 --> 25:04.696
Once we head in,
we'll take the lead.

25:04.813 --> 25:06.479
You watch our backs.

25:06.480 --> 25:08.004
Do you know where you're going?

25:08.808 --> 25:11.646
Our target is located
somewhere on the second level.

25:11.916 --> 25:14.567
Uh, maybe you could be
a little more specific?

25:15.042 --> 25:17.928
We don't have an exact floor
plan, if that's what you're asking.

25:18.334 --> 25:21.243
The whole second level
is a high-security sector.

25:21.337 --> 25:25.548
If you are unsure, would it not be
counter-productive for us to follow you?

25:25.616 --> 25:26.812
It's better this way.

25:26.813 --> 25:29.205
These wraith facilities
are very confusing.

25:29.563 --> 25:30.971
We know what we're looking for.

25:30.972 --> 25:32.167
Oh, and we don't?

25:32.202 --> 25:33.903
This isn't exactly
our first op, you know.

25:33.946 --> 25:35.061
Really.

25:35.062 --> 25:38.111
How many wraith have you
killed in hand-to-hand combat?

25:38.339 --> 25:39.841
I hardly think that's
what this is about.

25:39.842 --> 25:42.480
- That's what I thought.
- You know, we've taken out entire hive ships, okay?

25:42.559 --> 25:44.190
Compared to us, you are amateurs.

25:44.319 --> 25:45.797
Easy.

25:45.899 --> 25:47.788
If we can't play nice together,

25:47.800 --> 25:49.125
then let's not.

25:49.662 --> 25:52.817
We got a lot of ground to cover
in a short amount of time, so

25:52.999 --> 25:55.263
we will follow your lead

25:55.275 --> 25:58.360
then we'll split up into two teams
once we reach the second level.

25:58.361 --> 26:00.459
Are you cool with that?

26:03.594 --> 26:04.779
Yes

26:05.131 --> 26:06.421
Good

26:08.879 --> 26:10.940
Approaching target location.

26:53.161 --> 26:54.205
This is it.

26:55.398 --> 26:56.864
Hurry up!

26:56.923 --> 26:58.319
I got it.

27:03.460 --> 27:05.055
Everybody in.

27:26.890 --> 27:28.931
We'll go this way. You go that way.

27:28.942 --> 27:30.526
Contact us if you find anything.

27:30.527 --> 27:31.793
Yeah

27:35.177 --> 27:36.772
Good luck.

27:44.857 --> 27:46.347
Ronon...

27:48.253 --> 27:49.543
let's go.

28:04.555 --> 28:06.033
What do you think?

28:06.057 --> 28:09.476
Test subjects? Or the wraith
version of a vending machine.

28:09.477 --> 28:12.397
I hate to be the guy to say it, but
we can't really help these people.

28:12.398 --> 28:14.133
We got to keep moving.

28:15.960 --> 28:16.957
Right

28:20.587 --> 28:24.101
This thing's been way too
quiet and way too easy.

28:24.102 --> 28:26.587
I kind of like quiet and
easy. Makes for a nice change.

28:30.946 --> 28:32.740
Wraith!

28:38.646 --> 28:40.511
Ronon, wait!

29:04.071 --> 29:06.124
Rodney, get that door open!

29:10.364 --> 29:12.006
the hell with it.

29:14.839 --> 29:17.467
Aw, come on, it worked for him!

29:32.385 --> 29:34.000
Hah! I did it!

30:30.476 --> 30:32.142
Oh, thank god, it's you three.

30:32.143 --> 30:33.714
They got teyla and sheppard, and-

30:41.931 --> 30:43.585
bring him.

30:44.975 --> 30:46.864
Who's the amateur now?

30:58.183 --> 30:59.380
Ronon, what happened?

30:59.381 --> 31:01.113
I need to talk to
colonel carter right away

31:10.572 --> 31:12.624
John, are you all right?

31:13.011 --> 31:14.982
Bit of a hangover.

31:16.903 --> 31:19.730
The fact that ronon and his
buddies aren't here is a good sign.

31:19.731 --> 31:22.026
Not really.

31:23.557 --> 31:26.231
Ronon's buddies are the reason
we're here. They set us up.

31:26.416 --> 31:27.695
What are you talking about?

31:27.696 --> 31:29.771
I ran into them while
I was trying to esc-

31:29.912 --> 31:32.533
while I was effecting
a strategic retreat.

31:32.686 --> 31:33.859
They stunned me.

31:33.882 --> 31:35.067
Are you sure?

31:35.076 --> 31:37.750
It's pretty hard to
misinterpret something like that.

31:37.751 --> 31:39.287
Was ronon with them?

31:39.311 --> 31:40.965
I didn't see him.

31:43.539 --> 31:44.513
That one.

31:46.328 --> 31:47.818
Hold on, here, guys.

31:50.557 --> 31:52.211
Rodney...

31:53.114 --> 31:54.554
stay strong, rodney!

31:54.555 --> 31:56.267
I'll try.

32:00.190 --> 32:01.645
I said, I'm fine.

32:02.384 --> 32:05.821
I tried to radio sheppard, but got
no response from him, teyla, or mckay.

32:05.935 --> 32:07.343
And what about the satedans?

32:07.454 --> 32:08.627
We got separated.

32:08.721 --> 32:10.551
I'm guessing the
wraith got to them, too.

32:11.053 --> 32:13.141
So much for this op
being a cake-walk.

32:13.220 --> 32:13.970
Okay

32:14.041 --> 32:16.457
we've gone from support
to rescue and recovery.

32:16.516 --> 32:18.064
Dr. Zelenka, ready a jumper

32:18.065 --> 32:18.706
Yes, colonel.

32:18.707 --> 32:20.557
They'll be expecting us.

32:20.768 --> 32:22.375
Make that two jumpers.

32:27.789 --> 32:29.572
Would you guys mind telling
me where we're going?

32:29.991 --> 32:31.680
Seriously, I'm not
big on surprises.

32:31.689 --> 32:34.492
Even as a kid, I had to sneak a peek at my christmas
presents because I couldn't stand the suspense.

32:34.560 --> 32:37.352
- I remember this one time-
- we require your assistance.

32:37.353 --> 32:38.184
With what?

32:38.322 --> 32:40.973
You tampered with the
replicator base code.

32:41.205 --> 32:42.765
I don't know what
you're talking about.

32:42.844 --> 32:45.097
Okay, I may have made a few
small adjustments. So what?

32:45.272 --> 32:48.123
This is not the first time
they have challenged us.

32:48.636 --> 32:51.498
So it was the wraith that
deactivated the attack code.

32:51.542 --> 32:53.572
Many thousands of years ago.

32:53.721 --> 32:57.123
We had defeated the ancients. The
galaxy was ours, and then these...

32:57.226 --> 32:58.645
things appeared.

32:58.646 --> 33:00.733
- I take it you're not a big
fan- - they are an abomination!

33:00.800 --> 33:02.536
They're not even alive.

33:02.946 --> 33:05.046
In other words, you can't eat
them, so they're no good to you.

33:05.078 --> 33:06.415
They are machines.

33:06.474 --> 33:08.257
Machines can be reprogrammed.

33:08.805 --> 33:11.163
Okay, fine, so, what
do you want from me?

33:11.515 --> 33:15.046
We have attempted to upload the
deactivation virus once again.

33:15.181 --> 33:17.679
Our attempts have
been unsuccessful.

33:18.967 --> 33:24.500
We need you to undo the changes you made so as to
render the virus once more effective against them.

33:24.697 --> 33:27.172
Of course. I see.

33:27.776 --> 33:29.793
Things is, that could
be kind of tricky.

33:30.471 --> 33:33.615
The test subject will
make things easier for you.

33:36.450 --> 33:38.139
Test subject?

33:39.931 --> 33:41.796
A replicator.

33:41.840 --> 33:43.717
Oh, my god.

33:48.098 --> 33:51.113
I've thought about it, and I want
you to know that when the time comes,

33:51.114 --> 33:54.274
I'll respect whatever decision you
make regarding your future with us.

33:57.931 --> 34:00.571
This could be the one and
only op we go on together.

34:01.776 --> 34:03.700
Then we'd better
make the most of it.

34:07.365 --> 34:08.795
Dr. Mckay...

34:09.263 --> 34:10.846
how is your work progressing?

34:11.045 --> 34:12.254
It's been kind of slow.

34:12.402 --> 34:16.719
I mean, re-establishing the base code's original setting
isn't something I'll be able to accomplish overnight.

34:17.664 --> 34:20.703
Colonel sheppard and teyla will
be most disappointed to hear this.

34:20.887 --> 34:22.225
I'll see to it.

34:22.318 --> 34:24.406
I think I might be able to
get it finished much sooner.

34:25.494 --> 34:30.597
I understand your desire to delay in the hope that
it will give your people time to mount a rescue.

34:30.838 --> 34:34.005
In fact, I've just received
word they're on their way,

34:34.295 --> 34:37.391
but we are ready for them.

35:06.914 --> 35:08.427
Okay, they're moving away.

35:08.428 --> 35:10.128
Thank you, jumper two.

35:10.301 --> 35:11.826
Take us in, lieutenant.

35:11.838 --> 35:13.691
Yes, colonel.

35:27.386 --> 35:29.099
Let's go, let's go!

35:35.861 --> 35:37.856
There's a power relay
behind this wall here.

35:55.322 --> 35:57.339
- You all right?
- Well, it's about time.

35:57.340 --> 35:59.627
Any longer, we would've
had to save ourselves.

35:59.683 --> 36:01.700
Did ronon manage to
make it back to atlantis?

36:01.721 --> 36:03.269
- He did.
- Where is he?

36:03.270 --> 36:05.087
We split up to cover more ground.

36:05.287 --> 36:07.773
Secure the entrance. Let's go.

36:14.542 --> 36:16.337
All right, come on,
let's get out of here.

36:20.263 --> 36:21.812
Where are you holding them?

36:23.131 --> 36:26.225
Why don't you ask your friends? [

36:45.304 --> 36:46.372
All clear.

36:46.373 --> 36:48.213
All clear? You could've shot me!

36:54.551 --> 36:55.888
Oh, no.

36:56.251 --> 36:57.847
Oh, no...

37:25.128 --> 37:27.515
Let's go find ronon.

37:30.515 --> 37:32.334
Deal with him.

37:34.055 --> 37:35.861
You're wraith-worshipers?

37:36.023 --> 37:38.979
- Ronon, you need to understand
that- - after what they did to sateda!

37:39.084 --> 37:41.724
Sateda is gone and so
are the lives we knew.

37:42.621 --> 37:44.111
We had a choice

37:44.639 --> 37:48.439
to die with the past,
or live for the future.

37:50.779 --> 37:51.776
What did they do to you?

37:51.820 --> 37:54.823
They rewarded us with the
gift of everlasting life.

37:55.559 --> 37:58.727
The same gift can be yours,
if you're willing to accept it.

38:00.090 --> 38:02.729
We resisted at first,
we were stubborn,

38:03.219 --> 38:05.530
but the wraith were determined.

38:10.145 --> 38:12.233
They showed us our futures.

38:12.234 --> 38:15.119
They allowed us to experience our
life's end, pushing us to the brink

38:15.140 --> 38:17.838
so that we could see the truth,

38:17.937 --> 38:19.462
and brought us back

38:24.125 --> 38:28.063
They showed us again,
and again, and again...

38:28.380 --> 38:29.553
until they broke you.

38:29.562 --> 38:32.307
Until we finally accepted the truth

38:32.553 --> 38:34.324
and their gift

38:34.755 --> 38:36.116
Ronon...

38:36.230 --> 38:38.154
join us.

38:38.706 --> 38:39.961
You're insane

38:40.286 --> 38:42.362
Don't let your
pride get in the way.

38:44.925 --> 38:46.720
Like marika and hemi.

38:49.169 --> 38:51.186
They didn't die on
any run, did they?

38:52.087 --> 38:53.670
They were murdered
because they wouldn't turn.

38:53.671 --> 38:55.594
They were killed by
their own stubbornness.

38:55.615 --> 38:57.656
Don't make the same mistake.

38:57.773 --> 38:59.521
- Join us!
- No.

39:00.230 --> 39:01.497
Never.

39:02.330 --> 39:04.395
Run. You run.

39:04.396 --> 39:08.251
Run, and get away while you can, because the
next time we meet, it will not be as friends.

39:08.365 --> 39:10.477
There won't be a next time.

39:12.184 --> 39:14.096
We'll finish this
like true satedans.

39:14.107 --> 39:16.148
You are not satedans!

40:09.961 --> 40:11.580
Rakai, no!

40:12.688 --> 40:13.873
So much for honor.

40:13.874 --> 40:15.829
No weapons.

41:03.284 --> 41:05.349
Hasn't there been enough killing?

41:07.700 --> 41:09.261
Huh?

41:33.331 --> 41:35.900
Ronon, where are your friends?

41:36.952 --> 41:38.900
They're right here.

41:41.712 --> 41:43.612
Let's go home.

42:07.602 --> 42:09.267
Is that my painting?

42:09.332 --> 42:10.622
Yes.

42:10.833 --> 42:13.238
Rodney felt that you
should have it back.

42:14.162 --> 42:15.135
I didn't give it to him.

42:15.171 --> 42:18.561
Well, he helped himself, assuming
that you were leaving it behind.

42:28.348 --> 42:29.779
How you feeling?

42:34.794 --> 42:35.826
all right

42:36.363 --> 42:38.580
It's nice to have you back.

42:39.213 --> 42:40.339
Thanks

42:40.469 --> 42:42.228
It's good to be back
