Sal: <i>Attention, staff. Dr. Lola
Spratt used to be fat in high school.</i>

00:06.783 --> 00:11.119
<i>Pictures don't lie. That is all.
Lola: What? God. Dick-bag.</i>

00:11.209 --> 00:14.725
<i>Sal: Attention, staff. Chief's
right breast is made of spaghetti.</i>

00:14.727 --> 00:18.929
<i>Chief: How did you know that?
Sal: Attention, staff. It takes longer</i>

00:18.931 --> 00:22.043
<i>to build a blond snowman because
you have to hollow out the head.</i>

00:22.163 --> 00:25.071
Dori: That's offensive, but
most stereotypes are based on truth.

<i>Don't tell Dr. Valerie flame that
I stole her favorite eraser.</i>

00:37.017 --> 00:40.208
<i>That is all.
Valerie: [ Gasps ] Damn it.</i>

00:40.328 --> 00:42.314
I was just about to make a mistake, too.

00:42.434 --> 00:45.023
<i>There goes that plan.
Sy: You know, erasers are</i>

00:45.025 --> 00:49.327
<i>very expensive. It's much more cost-effective
if you don't make any mistakes at all.</i>

00:49.329 --> 00:54.827
<i>Blake: Okay. You're
gonna feel a little pinch.</i>

00:55.213 --> 00:58.336
<i>Sal: Attention, staff.
Will the clown doctor please</i>

00:58.338 --> 01:01.906
<i>report to the E.R. to suture a
young boy's head. That is all.</i>

01:01.908 --> 01:05.343
<i>Blake: [ Chuckles ] Will someone tell
him I'm down here and I'm doing it?</i>

01:05.345 --> 01:09.113
<i>Sorry about that.</i>
<i>Sal: Attention, staff.</i>

01:09.115 --> 01:14.085
<i>Dr. clowns, stop "clowning" around --
L.O.L.-- and suture a young boy's head.</i>

01:14.087 --> 01:18.856
<i>That is all.
Blake: I am here! And I am doing it!</i>

01:18.858 --> 01:22.712
<i>[ Inhales deeply ] [ Chuckles ] Sorry.</i>

01:22.832 --> 01:26.264
<i>It's just that if I'm off by even a
millimeter, he could lose an eyebrow.</i>

01:26.266 --> 01:30.968
<i>Or, even worse, an eyelash. But that is not
something you should worry about</i>

01:30.970 --> 01:33.327
<i>and certainly not something
you should have been told.</i>

01:34.511 --> 01:35.737
Sal: Attention, staff.

01:35.857 --> 01:40.117
<i>Will Dr. "Fake" Downs please report to the
hardware store, because I just nailed him.</i>

01:40.237 --> 01:43.571
<i>Blake: Put that on ice, please.
Sy, where's that P.A. booth?</i>

01:43.573 --> 01:46.743
<i>I want to give that guy a real piece of my mind.
Sy: I don't know who he is.</i>

01:46.863 --> 01:50.307
<i>N-no one knows who he is, where he is.
Owen: I heard he's a robot.</i>

01:50.427 --> 01:53.505
<i>Lola: Well, I met him once. Owen's right.
Robot.</i>

01:53.625 --> 01:55.532
Chief: That P.A. announcer's name...

01:55.652 --> 01:59.843
<i>is Sal Viscuso! [ Thunder rumbles]
and he lived here in the '30s,</i>

01:59.963 --> 02:03.535
<i>when this hospital was an orphanage.</i>

02:04.108 --> 02:06.800
Arthur Childrens was afraid of dying.

02:07.097 --> 02:11.495
<i>In his desperate search
for immortality, he conducted</i>

02:11.615 --> 02:13.531
<i>experiments on the orphans here,</i>

02:13.651 --> 02:18.578
hoping to extract a serum that
would freeze the aging process.

02:19.076 --> 02:21.310
<i>It was a stormy night, much like tonight.
,</i>

02:21.430 --> 02:23.603
Lightning was not on his side

02:23.723 --> 02:29.166
<i>and young Sal was accidentally killed.
Arthur: Oh, boy.</i>

02:29.452 --> 02:35.040
<i>Chief: Racked with guilt, Arthur shut down
the orphanage and opened this hospital.</i>

02:35.160 --> 02:41.629
<i>It's said that the ghost of the 10-year-old Sal
still haunts this place, while also regularly</i>

02:41.631 --> 02:48.368
<i>providing very useful information over the P.A.
from the same secret lab where he died.</i>

02:48.705 --> 02:53.108
<i>But no one knows where it is.
[ Thunder rumbles ]</i>

02:55.758 --> 02:58.998
<i>Lola: Oh. So are you gonna
come over here or...</i>

02:59.118 --> 03:03.944
<i>Chief: No, I'm good here.
Sy: Ghosts? That's ridiculous!</i>

03:05.016 --> 03:09.583
<i>Secret labs? Oh, I laugh at that.
10-year old boys accidentally</i>

03:09.703 --> 03:14.162
<i>killed during anti-aging experiments?
Oh, please, honey child.</i>

03:14.164 --> 03:18.096
<i>[ Laughs ] I have to go. Bye.
Blake: If I was in a secret lab</i>

03:18.216 --> 03:21.408
<i>where would I be?
Owen: Blake, I'll help you find it.</i>

03:21.528 --> 03:25.171
<i>I'm a ghost hunter. I've got my own
night-vision cameras, tons of cool equipment.</i>

03:25.291 --> 03:28.636
<i>Dori: Ghost sightings are
manifestations of psychological issues.</i>

03:28.756 --> 03:31.609
<i>Owen: Not true, Dori. I've been able to see
specters ever since that summer I lived</i>

03:31.729 --> 03:35.483
<i>with my uncle. Slept in his bed with him.
So, what do you say, guys?</i>

03:35.707 --> 03:38.118
<i>You're about to be molested.</i>

03:38.355 --> 03:41.694
Valerie: I'm sorry. What?
Owen: I said let's go bust some ghosts!

03:42.629 --> 03:47.362
<i>Valerie: Ah.
[ Thunder rumbles ]</i>

03:52.835 --> 03:56.972
<i>Sy: Sal? Sal, are you in here?
Because they are on to you.</i>

<i>[ Thunder crashes ]

04:05.329 --> 04:09.417
[ Thunder rumbling ] Sy: Oh, no.
Oh, no. I'm stuck.

04:09.419 --> 04:13.014
It's stuck -- and it's my good hand, too!
Now I'm going to have to learn

04:13.134 --> 04:17.029
to bat lefty! That means I'm gonna
pull all the balls to right field!

04:17.149 --> 04:20.327
Nooooooooooo!

04:24.552 --> 04:28.577
Owen: Okay, team. Listen up. Here are your
assignments -- Valerie, you're the former

04:28.697 --> 04:32.740
Christian whose faith was rocked by an
experience with a poltergeist one night as you

04:32.860 --> 04:36.185
slept in your uncle's bed.
Lola, you're the tech whiz.

04:36.305 --> 04:38.914
You've kept yourself glued to your
computer since you were a boy,

04:39.034 --> 04:41.952
because it's the only way you
know how to keep yourself

04:42.072 --> 04:45.312
from revealing your most horrible
secret to your parents...

04:45.835 --> 04:47.717
That you can see spirits.

04:47.967 --> 04:49.758
Dori, you're the intern.

04:49.878 --> 04:52.530
A curious freshman attracted to my power.

04:52.650 --> 04:55.643
But you're not gonna sleep
with me, because I'm your uncle.

04:56.216 --> 04:57.206
Gear check.

04:57.455 --> 05:00.583
Lola: I've never seen such acute
displacement of emotional trauma.

05:00.703 --> 05:04.036
This can only end awesome.
Owen: Okay.

05:04.156 --> 05:07.575
Don't be afraid, everyone.
Remember -- it's your fault.

05:07.695 --> 05:09.992
And if you ever speak a
word of this to anyone,

05:10.112 --> 05:14.019
Santa Claus will never
come to your houses again. Let's do this.

05:14.139 --> 05:16.734
Blake: [ Sighs ]

05:16.984 --> 05:19.095
Owen: Let's go, Blake --
to the abandoned basement!

05:20.659 --> 05:23.276
Blake: You been in this one spot
this whole time? Chief: Yep!

05:24.210 --> 05:28.771
Sy: I'm so hungry.
Maybe I could eat that bottle.

05:33.127 --> 05:37.102
Ow! Oh! Now I can't play first base.

05:37.513 --> 05:39.781
Owen: You don't have to be
afraid of anything.

05:39.901 --> 05:42.505
He can't hurt you anymore, Owen.
Lola: Oh, my God!

05:42.625 --> 05:45.433
He just called Blake "Owen." That's
so sad and awesome.

05:45.553 --> 05:46.229
Valerie: Quiet.

05:46.349 --> 05:47.557
He's about to say another crazy thing.

05:47.677 --> 05:49.601
Owen: <i>Your uncle won't touch</i>
your penis anymore.

05:49.721 --> 05:52.545
<i>All: Oh!
Sy: [ Exhales deeply ]</i>

05:52.665 --> 05:55.634
<i>I need some antibiotics.</i>

05:56.618 --> 06:02.429
Oh.
"Anti." I'm sure the rest says "biotics."

06:02.902 --> 06:05.582
<i>[ Thunder rumbles ]</i>

06:10.407 --> 06:14.943
<i>Blake: Firing records. Retiring records.
Owen: [ Sniffs ]</i>

06:15.063 --> 06:19.089
<i>You smell what I'm smelling? That's
evidence that the dead are close by.</i>

06:19.326 --> 06:22.961
<i>Sulfur, whiskey, old TV guides.</i>

06:23.081 --> 06:26.873
Blake: Bingo!
Hiring records. Sal Viscuso.

06:26.993 --> 06:33.066
<i>Born 1929. No date of death. Sal
Viscuso is still very much alive.</i>

06:34.773 --> 06:37.785
<i>[ All gasp ] What the hell was that?
Owen: I don't know.</i>

06:37.905 --> 06:40.133
<i>It came from the hallway. [Panting ]</i>

06:43.310 --> 06:44.768
There's no one here.

06:45.142 --> 06:51.246
<i>Blake: [ Screams ] [ All screaming ]
Owen: [ Screaming ]</i>

06:51.248 --> 06:55.559
<i>Sy: [ Screaming ] Arthur Childrens!</i>

06:55.783 --> 06:58.898
I was on my way in here to tell Sal

06:59.018 --> 07:00.621
<i>to move his P.A. booth.</i>

07:00.741 --> 07:03.118
Arthur: I can
no longer trust you to keep my secret, Sy.

07:03.238 --> 07:07.346
<i>Sy: But there's close to a 100% chance that you
are a very dapper hallucination, because I</i>

07:07.466 --> 07:08.682
<i>just drank those chemicals.</i>

07:08.802 --> 07:12.269
Arthur: If I
was a hallucination, could I do this?

07:12.389 --> 07:15.311
<i>Sy: Ow! My subconscious
totally made you up.</i>

07:15.431 --> 07:17.768
<i>Arthur: Then why is your subconscious
kicking you in the face?</i>

07:17.888 --> 07:22.058
<i>Sy: Ow! Ow! Do you have
to keep doing that? Ow!</i>

07:22.432 --> 07:25.362
<i>Blake: Owen, I am so</i> sorry
that we doubted you.

07:25.482 --> 07:26.309
Owen: That's the first ghost

07:26.429 --> 07:28.450
I've ever seen that didn't
resemble an older man!

07:28.570 --> 07:30.581
Most ghosts look just
like my father's brother.

07:30.701 --> 07:33.288
Blake: We thought
you had created this whole ghost scenario

07:33.290 --> 07:35.643
in your head because you
were clearly molested by your uncle.

07:35.763 --> 07:38.298
Owen: Wait. What did you just say?
Blake: To get to Sal, we just

07:38.418 --> 07:41.940
have to find his secret lab.
And bingo again!

07:42.177 --> 07:43.813
There's an unaccounted-for space

07:43.933 --> 07:47.749
right up here behind this wall
on the second floor. Let's go.

07:48.322 --> 07:50.976
Owen: [ Weakly ] No. Wait.

07:55.151 --> 07:58.179
Blake: Bingo a third time.

08:00.471 --> 08:04.319
Sy: Ow! Ow!
Blake: I know you're in there!

08:04.321 --> 08:12.483
Something. Need something. Yeah.
Perfect. [ Grunting ]

08:17.505 --> 08:21.056
Damn! I'm coming, Sal! [ Pounding ]

08:22.252 --> 08:26.272
Sy: You hear that sound? That sound is real!
That's what real sounds like.

08:26.392 --> 08:30.017
You, sir, are a hallucination!
[ Thunder rumbles ]

08:30.266 --> 08:31.400
Arthur: You're right.

08:32.929 --> 08:37.851
I <i>am</i> a hallucination. But I have feelings.
I was born hoping one day

08:37.971 --> 08:42.571
to become a dream, and then when I
became a full-on hallucination,

08:42.996 --> 08:46.222
I thought, "Look ma, I made it.

08:46.342 --> 08:50.574
Are you happy now?"
I want to be a real man.

08:51.147 --> 08:53.602
Can't a hallucination

08:53.722 --> 09:00.786
have a dream? No.
[ Pounding continues ]

09:01.110 --> 09:02.808
Sy: In here!

09:08.131 --> 09:12.569
Blake: [ Panting ] What?!

09:12.689 --> 09:15.215
[ Knock on door ]

09:17.171 --> 09:19.751
Sal: Sorry about the banging.
Sy: Sal.

09:19.871 --> 09:21.987
Sal: Eighty years, and you'd think I'd
remember the code.

09:22.107 --> 09:22.921
Sy: Sal, listen!

09:23.041 --> 09:28.122
I need you to go find a knife and
cut my arm off so I can be free.

09:28.242 --> 09:32.991
Sal: [ Sighs ] Attention, Sy. Why
don't I just move the shelf?

09:33.111 --> 09:36.765
Sy: That is all?
Sal: That is all.

09:38.372 --> 09:40.341
Sy: [ Sighs, groans ]

09:47.218 --> 09:53.092
Blake: Where is he? Sy! Where
have you been? You've...

09:54.034 --> 09:57.473
Hey, that's him. Hey! Hey, come here!
I want to -- Hey, stop that kid!

09:57.593 --> 10:01.628
Chief: No, thanks.
Blake: Who are you? Huh?

10:01.748 --> 10:03.136
Sal: Just leave me alone!

10:09.251 --> 10:12.213
You won't find him again.

10:16.137 --> 10:20.897
Take my advice, son. Ain't
nothing you can do about it.

10:21.520 --> 10:25.389
Blake: Yeah. Who are you?
A friend.

10:26.971 --> 10:28.192
Blake: A friend, huh?

10:30.592 --> 10:31.566
Thank you, friend.

10:32.904 --> 10:36.109
Sy: So Arthur Childrens' youth
serum experiments didn't kill Sal,

10:36.229 --> 10:40.399
but it <i>did</i> stunt his natural aging process.
Chief: But if he's been a kid

10:40.519 --> 10:43.796
for decades, he might as well be a ghost.

10:43.916 --> 10:46.761
I mean, at least that's the
way it looks from here.

10:46.881 --> 10:50.451
I don't mean
<i>here</i> here, I mean the royal here.

10:50.453 --> 10:52.420
Sy: Ah, tomato.

10:55.906 --> 10:59.609
Owen: Hi, aunt Joy. It's Owen.
I'm great.

10:59.729 --> 11:02.421
Is uncle Ken available, please? I need to
speak with him.

11:02.994 --> 11:05.113
He's on a scout camp-out?

11:06.788 --> 11:09.318
Sal: I ain't 'fraid no goat.
