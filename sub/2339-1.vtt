01:41.917 --> 01:42.876
Sorry

01:45.084 --> 01:47.792
Not again. What's up with you lately?

01:47.792 --> 01:50.001
The traffic was really bad

01:50.251 --> 01:51.334
Liar

01:51.542 --> 01:53.959
I just called the doorman at your place

01:54.084 --> 01:56.251
He said you left at 12:30

01:57.376 --> 01:58.459
Hmm

01:59.667 --> 02:01.584
I didn't know you care so much about me

02:02.542 --> 02:03.834
I just wanna do my job

02:05.292 --> 02:06.334
Let's get started then

02:13.584 --> 02:16.917
Zhou Xun

02:21.834 --> 02:23.709
Your dad's birthday's coming up

02:23.709 --> 02:25.167
What are you getting him?

02:25.167 --> 02:27.501
I dunno. Help me pick something

02:27.792 --> 02:29.084
He's your dad

02:29.084 --> 02:31.167
You know how much he likes you

02:31.167 --> 02:32.709
He'll be happy with anything you pick

02:33.542 --> 02:36.459
What did you give him last year?

02:36.876 --> 02:37.792
A bunch of porn

02:37.792 --> 02:39.792
Huang Xiao Ming

02:39.792 --> 02:40.876
Right

02:41.167 --> 02:43.084
You have such great taste!

02:43.834 --> 02:47.626
Well, it's been some time since my mom died

02:47.626 --> 02:49.709
Can't blame my dad for having needs

02:49.709 --> 02:51.709
Let's go for the same thing this year

02:51.917 --> 02:53.459
But hey

02:53.667 --> 02:55.501
Burn me a copy this time

02:57.667 --> 02:59.292
Can you behave yourself?

03:00.709 --> 03:02.251
What did I do wrong?

03:03.626 --> 03:04.667
Fine

03:06.334 --> 03:08.084
I've got some good news

03:08.084 --> 03:09.042
What?

03:09.042 --> 03:10.376
I'm seeing someone

03:11.501 --> 03:14.917
Executive Producer
Wang Zhonglei

03:18.834 --> 03:22.751
A Pang Ho-Cheung Film

03:26.709 --> 03:28.167
Is everything okay?

03:28.834 --> 03:30.167
Sorry

03:30.167 --> 03:32.751
My girlfriend spilled her wine

03:32.751 --> 03:34.334
- Can you please clean it up?
- Of course

03:37.542 --> 03:38.584
Why did he think...

03:38.584 --> 03:40.376
You'd be happy for him?

03:40.584 --> 03:42.126
He's a dumbass!

03:44.251 --> 03:46.334
He said I used to ask him

03:46.667 --> 03:48.542
Why he's been single for so long

03:49.084 --> 03:52.209
He thought I'd be glad to hear the news

03:52.209 --> 03:53.709
Well, did you use to do that?

03:54.209 --> 03:55.751
Of course not!

03:59.501 --> 04:00.542
Did I?

04:04.626 --> 04:06.792
Why don't you get a girlfriend?

04:07.459 --> 04:08.251
Hey!

04:08.251 --> 04:09.792
Why aren't you seeing anyone?

04:12.251 --> 04:13.917
Why don't you have a girlfriend?

04:13.917 --> 04:16.000
Well, you can't blame him then

04:16.500 --> 04:18.584
I did everything I could already

04:18.584 --> 04:20.291
I'm a girl

04:20.291 --> 04:21.834
I can't just say to him

04:21.834 --> 04:23.209
"Hey, hit on me?"

04:23.834 --> 04:26.251
I called you here to make her feel better

04:26.959 --> 04:28.084
Sorry

04:28.084 --> 04:29.959
I'm still hung over

04:29.959 --> 04:31.584
Alright, let me get this straight

04:31.584 --> 04:32.167
Hey!

04:32.167 --> 04:34.376
You said her boyfriend cheated on her...

04:34.376 --> 04:36.542
With this slutty bitch from Taiwan, right?

04:37.584 --> 04:40.667
But he never really went out with her

04:40.667 --> 04:42.084
So he's not actually cheating

04:43.209 --> 04:44.917
He betrayed my trust!

04:44.917 --> 04:46.167
When we were in college, he told me

04:46.167 --> 04:47.542
He wouldn't date anyone

04:48.501 --> 04:50.042
My family's not really well off

04:50.042 --> 04:51.959
And my dad's getting old

04:51.959 --> 04:53.751
I want him to have a better life

04:53.792 --> 04:55.251
I wanna put my career first

04:55.251 --> 04:56.417
and make a good living

04:58.709 --> 05:00.667
- And...
- When you become a big shot

05:00.667 --> 05:01.792
Until then...

05:01.792 --> 05:03.126
I won't date

05:03.126 --> 05:05.334
You can get a girlfriend anytime you want

05:05.334 --> 05:06.417
Eh?

05:06.501 --> 05:07.584
So you knew it all along

05:07.584 --> 05:08.292
What?

05:08.292 --> 05:09.876
You can't blame him, can you?

05:10.251 --> 05:12.334
I was waiting for him!

05:14.126 --> 05:15.626
Whose side is she on?

05:15.626 --> 05:16.376
Leave us alone!

05:16.376 --> 05:17.251
Get out!

05:17.876 --> 05:20.126
Did you ask him how he met that bitch?

05:23.001 --> 05:24.209
I didn't need to

05:25.001 --> 05:26.084
He told me

05:26.084 --> 05:28.251
Remember my business trip to Taiwan last month?

05:36.126 --> 05:41.334
"Love is like the wind"

05:41.709 --> 05:47.834
"It comes and goes without a trace"

05:48.084 --> 05:53.626
"Making you smile, leaving you in sorrow"

05:54.417 --> 05:55.251
Excuse me...

05:55.251 --> 05:56.459
Can I sit here?

05:57.001 --> 05:58.001
Sure!

05:58.001 --> 06:01.001
- I haven't slept for days
- But, uh...

06:04.042 --> 06:05.709
Can you wake me up...

06:05.709 --> 06:07.126
When we get to Terminal 2?

06:08.709 --> 06:09.667
Thanks

06:12.917 --> 06:13.917
Okay

06:20.126 --> 06:23.251
She was sleeping like a kitten

06:23.917 --> 06:26.251
I felt this urge to protect her

06:27.251 --> 06:29.709
I guess men work out at the gym

06:29.709 --> 06:31.167
So that one day we can give girls like her

06:31.209 --> 06:33.084
A shoulder to lean on

07:02.959 --> 07:03.917
We're here

07:10.626 --> 07:12.126
Oops! I drooled

07:12.584 --> 07:14.376
This is so embarrassing

07:16.667 --> 07:18.001
It's all your fault

07:18.292 --> 07:19.209
Huh?

07:20.126 --> 07:21.834
It felt so good

07:22.126 --> 07:24.042
Sleeping on your shoulder

07:24.042 --> 07:25.542
So I drooled

07:26.834 --> 07:28.251
This is so not me

07:30.959 --> 07:31.876
Hey, wait

07:31.876 --> 07:32.917
You left your camera behind

07:33.542 --> 07:35.167
You're sweet

07:35.292 --> 07:37.292
Anyway, bye

07:41.042 --> 07:42.084
Hey!

07:42.417 --> 07:43.501
Wait!

07:45.251 --> 07:46.084
She's a pro

07:46.084 --> 07:47.334
Any hope for me?

07:47.876 --> 07:48.917
Nope

07:48.917 --> 07:51.792
Oh my God! Look at this!

07:52.792 --> 07:55.709
My Love

07:55.959 --> 07:59.001
My Darling

07:59.626 --> 08:01.709
Have you stopped going to therapy?

08:01.834 --> 08:03.959
Ever since watching "Ghost" when I was small

08:04.042 --> 08:06.126
I've wanted to learn this

08:06.251 --> 08:07.751
I fantasized

08:07.834 --> 08:09.334
While I play with the clay

08:09.334 --> 08:11.251
A man just like in the movie

08:11.667 --> 08:13.334
Would hug me from behind

08:13.709 --> 08:15.417
And we'd work on it together

08:16.709 --> 08:18.292
They make pottery in "Ghost"

08:18.292 --> 08:20.751
This is sculpture

08:20.751 --> 08:23.001
It doesn't spin

08:23.001 --> 08:24.459
Who cares

08:25.001 --> 08:26.251
The point is...

08:26.251 --> 08:27.751
It's gotta be

08:27.751 --> 08:29.626
A topless guy

08:29.917 --> 08:31.417
Hugging me from behind

08:33.458 --> 08:34.376
Don't tell me

08:34.376 --> 08:36.458
You've never shagged a guy here before

08:39.333 --> 08:40.042
Sorry

08:40.042 --> 08:41.376
My bad

08:42.376 --> 08:44.126
Listen

08:44.751 --> 08:46.459
Find a new guy. It's been too long

08:46.459 --> 08:49.251
Why are you so into him?

08:49.876 --> 08:51.834
True, he has a big nose

08:51.834 --> 08:53.959
So his package down under must be...

08:55.334 --> 08:56.751
Well, I know you don't give a shit

08:57.167 --> 08:59.126
You drive guys crazy

08:59.584 --> 09:02.167
You'll never know how I feel

09:02.376 --> 09:04.042
He wanted to put his career first

09:04.042 --> 09:06.042
I tried to get him a promotion

09:06.042 --> 09:07.626
That's why I sent him to Taiwan

09:08.001 --> 09:10.667
But he didn't get it at all

09:11.459 --> 09:12.876
He hooked up with a girl there

09:12.876 --> 09:14.792
How can I let it go?

09:14.792 --> 09:16.334
You're right

09:16.501 --> 09:17.626
I get it

09:18.167 --> 09:20.084
This isn't about her anymore

09:20.334 --> 09:23.376
It's about our pride as Shanghai girls

09:24.667 --> 09:26.792
Just help me get him back

09:27.042 --> 09:28.751
A great man once said

09:29.084 --> 09:31.417
"With great power comes great responsibility"

09:31.417 --> 09:34.751
Sounds familiar. Who said that?

09:35.084 --> 09:36.251
Spiderman

09:36.334 --> 09:37.834
You're lucky to have me

09:37.834 --> 09:39.501
I'm the best sweet-talker in town

09:39.501 --> 09:40.959
This is a hard one

09:41.042 --> 09:43.251
But I'm gonna help you

09:43.251 --> 09:44.501
- Thank you
- Not so fast

09:45.126 --> 09:46.292
Your case is...

09:46.292 --> 09:48.251
Really tricky

09:48.251 --> 09:49.459
My enemy's too tough

09:50.376 --> 09:52.042
I donâ€™t mind tough competition

09:52.126 --> 09:53.792
But I do mind a dumbass teammate

09:57.542 --> 09:59.084
Time to call the girls

09:59.251 --> 10:01.709
Those Taiwan chicks think they can flirt

10:01.709 --> 10:03.084
Let's show them

10:03.084 --> 10:04.501
How it's really done

10:04.501 --> 10:05.834
Get ready...

10:05.834 --> 10:07.126
To get your man back

10:07.709 --> 10:09.209
The name of our mission?

10:09.209 --> 10:11.001
Who we're proud to be...

10:12.876 --> 10:15.167
"Women Who Flirt"

10:22.084 --> 10:23.626
According to our test

10:23.626 --> 10:24.917
It took the waitress 2 mins and 16 secs

10:24.917 --> 10:27.542
To notice the spilled wine

10:29.209 --> 10:30.792
What's her name?

10:30.792 --> 10:32.251
I'll fire her

10:33.084 --> 10:35.626
Mr. Qiu, the performance of your staff

10:35.626 --> 10:38.042
Is not the problem here

10:38.042 --> 10:39.667
There's a serious imbalance between

10:39.667 --> 10:41.917
Your staff and customers

10:42.292 --> 10:45.209
A customer spends over 500 RMB on average

10:45.209 --> 10:47.292
In China that means a high-end client

10:47.292 --> 10:49.792
At a similar restaurant abroad

10:49.792 --> 10:53.001
The customer/staff ratio would be 1.57

10:53.001 --> 10:54.626
So basically

10:54.626 --> 10:56.709
You're understaffed

10:56.709 --> 10:58.334
That affects the quality of your service

10:59.417 --> 11:01.001
But last time I checked

11:01.251 --> 11:02.501
There's enough staff

11:03.167 --> 11:04.209
Right, Mr. Qiu

11:04.209 --> 11:05.417
That's true

11:05.626 --> 11:07.251
We checked with the restaurant

11:07.251 --> 11:09.292
There're two shifts in a day

11:09.292 --> 11:11.042
7 to 8 people work on each shift

11:11.042 --> 11:12.417
But at least three of them

11:12.417 --> 11:14.501
Are related to the manager

11:14.792 --> 11:16.084
His cousin

11:16.084 --> 11:17.292
His uncle-in-law

11:17.292 --> 11:18.292
His ex-wife's nephew

11:18.292 --> 11:20.501
High school friends of his ex-wife's nephew

11:20.501 --> 11:22.501
Most of the time

11:22.667 --> 11:23.917
These people go AWOL

11:24.709 --> 11:26.084
How's that possible?

11:26.084 --> 11:28.501
Many business owners find it hard to believe

11:28.501 --> 11:30.542
But these things happen

11:30.876 --> 11:34.501
That's why we're here

11:34.667 --> 11:38.667
If I let you inspect all my restaurants

11:38.667 --> 11:41.876
I'd get a discount, right?

11:42.751 --> 11:45.126
Yes, I'll give you a special offer

11:49.834 --> 11:51.251
- Marco!
- Yes?

11:53.167 --> 11:54.126
Where are you going?

11:54.126 --> 11:56.584
Hailey left her keys at home. I'm going back

11:57.542 --> 12:00.209
Are you kidding? Michael might wanna talk

12:00.209 --> 12:03.001
You can handle it, you silly goose

12:03.501 --> 12:05.042
Tell him I'm on a site visit

12:05.042 --> 12:06.042
Come on!

12:06.042 --> 12:07.751
By the way, are you free tonight?

12:09.376 --> 12:10.792
Yeah, why?

12:10.792 --> 12:12.792
I told Hailey about you.
She wanna buy you dinner

12:12.792 --> 12:14.626
Sure, see you tonight

12:22.251 --> 12:23.376
Well done

12:23.917 --> 12:26.167
Once we seal the deal with Qiu

12:26.167 --> 12:27.584
You'll need more people on the team

12:27.584 --> 12:29.917
I'll put you in charge of Unit C and D

12:29.917 --> 12:32.792
You should pick someone from your team too

12:33.292 --> 12:34.917
Do you have anyone in mind?

12:37.167 --> 12:38.626
Marco's great

12:39.251 --> 12:40.501
Marco?

12:40.834 --> 12:41.751
Really?

12:41.917 --> 12:43.209
Where's he gone anyway?

12:44.167 --> 12:49.001
He's at a client's office

12:50.459 --> 12:53.084
Okay... it's up to you

12:53.209 --> 12:54.084
Thank you

12:54.084 --> 12:55.542
- See you
- Alright then, see you

13:02.042 --> 13:03.042
Hey

13:03.042 --> 13:05.126
That chick is inviting me to dinner tonight

13:06.042 --> 13:07.792
That bitch is making the first move

13:09.126 --> 13:10.376
Take the afternoon off

13:10.667 --> 13:11.459
Why?

13:11.459 --> 13:13.334
You need a makeover

13:15.876 --> 13:17.584
Cut the crap, come over now

13:17.584 --> 13:18.959
I'm gonna get you some help

13:18.959 --> 13:20.501
Alright, alright

13:29.209 --> 13:31.209
Honey, sorry, gotta run

13:38.167 --> 13:39.751
Babe, I gotta go

13:41.626 --> 13:43.792
Aw, I want that bag

13:43.792 --> 13:47.584
Sure, let's go shopping

13:49.959 --> 13:51.084
The best pick-up artists in town

13:51.084 --> 13:52.667
Are all here

13:52.667 --> 13:53.876
Let's welcome my girls...

13:54.001 --> 13:55.334
The Barbie Army!

13:55.501 --> 13:57.126
Hi, I'm Gigi

13:57.959 --> 13:59.542
Hi, I'm Kiki

14:00.292 --> 14:01.834
Hello, I'm Mimi

14:03.334 --> 14:04.584
Hi, I'm Lily

14:06.584 --> 14:08.209
Which one of you did I meet last time?

14:13.542 --> 14:14.167
Hi

14:14.167 --> 14:16.876
It's not just about you

14:17.126 --> 14:19.917
The dinner tonight is a matter of pride

14:19.917 --> 14:22.084
Don't you dare embarrass us

14:22.751 --> 14:23.709
Go

14:23.709 --> 14:25.751
Now, loosen up

14:33.084 --> 14:36.001
As they say, you are what you wear

14:36.292 --> 14:38.459
Shanghai girls are

14:38.459 --> 14:39.709
Fashionable

14:39.709 --> 14:40.876
Sophisticated

14:40.959 --> 14:41.959
And sweet

14:41.959 --> 14:43.667
Show that Taiwan chick

14:43.667 --> 14:46.084
Who she's messing with

14:48.042 --> 14:49.751
Remember, grab every chance you get

14:49.751 --> 14:51.792
To show cleavage

14:51.917 --> 14:53.417
Strut your stuff

14:53.417 --> 14:55.584
Drop something

14:55.584 --> 14:57.251
That will do the trick

14:58.042 --> 14:59.251
Opps!

15:00.376 --> 15:01.959
I dropped something

15:04.209 --> 15:05.959
Oh, God

15:06.917 --> 15:08.292
But hey

15:08.292 --> 15:10.417
Her boobs are much bigger than mine

15:10.417 --> 15:12.959
Doesn't matter. Boobs are boobs

15:12.959 --> 15:14.376
Squeeze them hard

15:14.376 --> 15:16.084
Look at my boobs

15:16.084 --> 15:17.542
Oops! Now, pick it up

15:17.542 --> 15:19.126
Not too fast

15:19.126 --> 15:21.126
Take it slow

15:21.126 --> 15:22.792
Let them take a good look

15:22.792 --> 15:23.751
There you go!

15:23.751 --> 15:25.126
Confidence is all that matters

15:26.042 --> 15:27.709
Picture that slutty bitch in your head

15:27.959 --> 15:30.251
- Ready to squeeze?
- Come on!

15:30.251 --> 15:31.334
Squeeze

15:31.792 --> 15:33.584
That's what you call a woman's weapon

15:36.917 --> 15:39.126
Oops

15:39.126 --> 15:42.751
If this is too hard for you

15:42.751 --> 15:44.292
Then learn this

15:44.459 --> 15:45.459
Take a selfie

15:45.959 --> 15:47.876
You can post it online

15:47.876 --> 15:49.459
Let everyone see it

15:49.584 --> 15:51.376
Do these poses

15:51.376 --> 15:52.501
One

15:54.167 --> 15:55.584
Two

15:56.834 --> 15:58.251
- Five
- One

15:58.667 --> 15:59.917
Is that Dr. Evil?

16:00.626 --> 16:02.501
- Two
- Open your eyes

16:02.792 --> 16:03.792
Two

16:04.084 --> 16:05.751
Wider, wider

16:06.459 --> 16:07.751
Like a scared baby

16:08.167 --> 16:09.667
That's right

16:10.959 --> 16:12.292
You got it

16:12.334 --> 16:14.792
Relax. One, two, five

16:16.209 --> 16:19.292
This is harder than I thought

16:20.459 --> 16:22.584
That's all the basics

16:22.584 --> 16:25.084
One, two, five

16:25.084 --> 16:26.334
Good

16:38.792 --> 16:39.709
Get out

16:55.459 --> 16:57.001
Do you have a reservation, ma'am?

16:57.001 --> 16:59.876
- 7 o'clock, Mr. Gong
- 7 o'clock

17:02.334 --> 17:03.167
I'm sorry, ma'am

17:03.167 --> 17:04.959
We don't have your reservation

17:05.584 --> 17:06.626
Really?

17:07.334 --> 17:08.291
Excuse me

17:12.416 --> 17:14.584
What name is the reservation under?

17:14.834 --> 17:15.916
What?

17:29.501 --> 17:31.834
- Feeling cold?
- I'm just hungry

17:40.917 --> 17:42.334
What the...

17:48.084 --> 17:49.542
Angie, dear

17:50.917 --> 17:53.126
It's so nice to meet you

17:54.084 --> 17:57.251
Hubby told me so much about you

17:57.876 --> 17:59.042
Wow!

17:59.084 --> 18:01.334
You look just like I thought

18:01.709 --> 18:02.959
- Is that right?
- Yes

18:03.251 --> 18:05.001
You are different than I thought

18:05.001 --> 18:06.376
Seriously?

18:07.084 --> 18:09.084
I don't wanna give a bad impression

18:15.167 --> 18:16.209
Hi, Wang

18:16.209 --> 18:17.417
Oh, it's you

18:19.501 --> 18:20.834
Hey, sorry

18:20.834 --> 18:22.376
I was rushing to pick her up

18:22.667 --> 18:24.042
I forgot to call you

18:24.751 --> 18:26.209
You didn't go to the restaurant, right?

18:27.751 --> 18:29.084
Hubby told me

18:29.084 --> 18:30.459
You used to come here with him

18:30.459 --> 18:32.209
When you were in college

18:32.376 --> 18:34.501
I wanted to meet you

18:34.501 --> 18:35.459
And

18:36.084 --> 18:38.292
And hear his story from you

18:38.292 --> 18:40.542
So we decided to eat here instead

18:41.126 --> 18:41.959
Eh?

18:41.959 --> 18:43.084
Angie, dear

18:43.084 --> 18:45.792
Where did you use to sit?

18:46.167 --> 18:47.292
Me?

18:47.542 --> 18:48.667
Right where you are now

18:52.167 --> 18:55.292
I hate you! I hate you!

18:55.376 --> 18:57.542
You should have told me!

18:57.834 --> 18:59.959
It's rude of me to take her seat

19:00.209 --> 19:01.084
Angie, dear

19:01.084 --> 19:01.959
Shall we

19:02.251 --> 19:03.501
Switch our seats?

19:04.626 --> 19:07.376
Right, you two should switch seats

19:08.001 --> 19:10.667
You like sitting next to me

19:10.667 --> 19:11.542
No, I'm good

19:12.917 --> 19:14.084
Dinner's ready

19:17.167 --> 19:19.667
(Let me take a look at that slutty bitch!)

19:20.167 --> 19:23.584
You two are still together? That's sweet

19:24.167 --> 19:27.876
Well, we're...

19:28.001 --> 19:29.042
Working together

19:29.376 --> 19:31.417
This is my girlfriend

19:31.792 --> 19:32.917
Hi, Wang

19:34.376 --> 19:35.501
Wow

19:35.501 --> 19:38.292
This looks delicious

19:38.292 --> 19:40.667
You're cute, and you cook so well

19:40.667 --> 19:42.709
No wonder hubby used to come here

19:45.667 --> 19:47.876
I thought you hated taking pictures
of your food

19:49.876 --> 19:51.126
People change

19:52.042 --> 19:53.376
You of all people should know that

19:53.792 --> 19:55.584
You're someone's hubby now, aren't you?

19:55.751 --> 19:57.417
When did that happen?

19:57.417 --> 19:58.792
Last time I checked, you're still a virgin

19:59.626 --> 20:00.751
Ha ha

20:01.042 --> 20:02.126
Not funny

20:04.126 --> 20:05.751
You can tell she's a scheming bitch

20:08.126 --> 20:09.709
She's got a nice rack though

20:09.917 --> 20:12.084
Damn, this is bad

20:15.667 --> 20:17.751
I've seen it all

20:17.751 --> 20:20.501
They lavish you with fake compliments

20:20.501 --> 20:23.251
Angie, dear, I love what you're wearing

20:23.251 --> 20:26.542
I studied fashion design in France

20:26.709 --> 20:29.167
And I had a thing for this kinda...

20:29.751 --> 20:31.667
Theatrical outfit

20:32.626 --> 20:34.251
But I always knew

20:34.251 --> 20:36.001
I couldn't pull it off

20:36.001 --> 20:39.126
It makes me look like a clown

20:39.334 --> 20:41.959
I prefer something simpler

20:41.959 --> 20:44.417
nothing flashy

20:44.417 --> 20:45.334
You know?

20:45.917 --> 20:47.459
She looks like Lady Gaga tonight

20:50.834 --> 20:52.084
They act all innocent

20:52.084 --> 20:54.084
They're really good at it

20:54.084 --> 20:55.042
They make a man feel like a hero

20:55.042 --> 20:56.292
I wish I could be more independent

20:56.292 --> 20:58.459
Like you, Angie

20:58.459 --> 21:00.542
Taking care of myself

21:00.667 --> 21:02.042
But I just can't

21:02.792 --> 21:05.251
Thank God my hubby was with me last time

21:05.251 --> 21:08.417
Without him I'd have lost my passport

21:09.959 --> 21:11.167
Sweetie, did you tell dear Angie

21:11.167 --> 21:13.459
About the blackout at my place?

21:13.667 --> 21:15.501
Oh right

21:15.501 --> 21:17.042
- The other day...
- Stop

21:18.501 --> 21:21.084
Stop! Stop! Stop!

21:21.126 --> 21:23.542
It's so embarrassing

21:24.542 --> 21:26.292
Fine, go ahead

21:26.751 --> 21:27.667
I guess...

21:27.667 --> 21:29.376
Angie's part of our family now

21:29.459 --> 21:30.626
Exactly!

21:30.792 --> 21:32.917
I think it's kinda cute, too

21:33.709 --> 21:34.917
Alright

21:34.917 --> 21:37.876
The other night she called me crying

21:37.876 --> 21:40.126
The power went out at her place. She got scared

21:40.126 --> 21:41.917
So I took a cab and rushed over

21:41.917 --> 21:43.167
Guess what?

21:43.167 --> 21:44.959
Stop, really

21:45.209 --> 21:45.917
Please stop

21:45.917 --> 21:47.376
- Don't tell her
- It wasn't...

21:47.376 --> 21:50.167
It wasn't a blackout

21:50.167 --> 21:52.417
She just forgot to pay the electric bill

21:52.751 --> 21:54.792
I hate you

21:55.417 --> 21:56.709
Angie, you wouldn't believe it

21:56.709 --> 21:59.834
The whole place fell into darkness

21:59.834 --> 22:00.834
But...

22:01.417 --> 22:03.751
That's also the night we got together

22:08.042 --> 22:09.209
I hate you

22:09.209 --> 22:12.501
And worst of all, they can make a man

22:12.501 --> 22:14.501
Do whatever they want

22:16.001 --> 22:17.001
Hubby

22:17.001 --> 22:17.917
Feed me

22:20.626 --> 22:21.792
Be careful. It's hot

22:23.417 --> 22:24.292
Here

22:26.709 --> 22:27.792
Is it good?

22:28.001 --> 22:29.501
I love it when you feed me

22:31.209 --> 22:33.834
This is their signature dish, rabbit stir fry

22:34.209 --> 22:36.417
We used to order this all the time

22:44.751 --> 22:45.751
What's wrong?

22:47.001 --> 22:49.042
Is it too spicy? Drink some water

22:49.751 --> 22:51.209
Here you go

22:51.917 --> 22:53.376
What's wrong? Why are you crying?

22:54.167 --> 22:56.417
How could you?

22:58.209 --> 23:00.084
Bunnies are cute

23:00.334 --> 23:02.042
You're so cruel

23:02.042 --> 23:05.376
I used to have a pet rabbit

23:06.709 --> 23:09.126
I was born in the year of the rabbit

23:10.417 --> 23:11.334
Okay

23:13.917 --> 23:16.376
Don't cry

23:20.001 --> 23:21.542
(What should I do?)

23:22.001 --> 23:23.751
Don't cry, my dear

23:23.751 --> 23:25.959
We won't eat it anymore

23:28.126 --> 23:30.001
That's so cruel

23:30.001 --> 23:31.417
The tears are ruining your makeup

23:31.417 --> 23:32.917
Don't cry, my darling

23:32.917 --> 23:34.167
Please don't cry

23:34.167 --> 23:35.834
I'll stop eating it

23:36.584 --> 23:38.834
And so will you

23:39.584 --> 23:42.042
Yuck, I hate rabbit meat

23:44.334 --> 23:45.667
Don't cry, honey

23:47.459 --> 23:49.584
She's still eating!

23:49.834 --> 23:53.001
Girls don't eat bunnies. That's cruel

23:53.001 --> 23:54.959
Now that's unfair

23:55.042 --> 23:56.542
She's a dude

23:56.542 --> 23:58.001
She pees standing up

24:01.292 --> 24:03.709
Let's go. We're not eating it.

24:04.042 --> 24:05.126
Let's go home

24:08.209 --> 24:09.709
Don't cry

24:09.751 --> 24:11.292
That was horrible

24:11.292 --> 24:12.667
We'll be home soon

24:25.584 --> 24:26.876
It's over

24:43.792 --> 24:45.126
Whoa

24:46.251 --> 24:47.626
Did someone break in last night?

24:53.376 --> 24:55.959
You were right. I should just let go

24:56.667 --> 24:58.667
I was so stupid

24:59.334 --> 25:00.959
It was a trap

25:01.709 --> 25:04.167
And I walked right into it

25:05.959 --> 25:08.376
Alright

25:08.376 --> 25:09.501
It was pretty bad

25:10.334 --> 25:12.042
But that was just one night

25:12.042 --> 25:13.626
We still have a chance

25:13.626 --> 25:14.542
Hey!

25:14.751 --> 25:16.126
What's this?

25:19.251 --> 25:24.209
My aunt in Hong Kong sent it to me

25:24.459 --> 25:27.667
She said I shouldn't get a dog if I'm single

25:27.667 --> 25:30.501
Or I'll end up like that woman in the news

25:32.751 --> 25:37.501
(Dead Spinster Eaten by Pets)

25:44.667 --> 25:45.626
It's over

25:46.876 --> 25:49.376
I'm hopeless

25:49.709 --> 25:52.042
Just let me be

25:56.792 --> 25:58.626
It's not over

25:58.792 --> 26:00.876
Until I say so

26:03.167 --> 26:04.126
Get up

26:05.334 --> 26:07.167
Angie's been acting weird lately

26:08.084 --> 26:09.834
She's not into me, is she?

26:09.834 --> 26:11.126
If I were her

26:11.126 --> 26:12.626
I'd crush you to death right now

26:13.126 --> 26:15.917
When we were in college, we all knew

26:15.917 --> 26:17.459
Angie's got a thing for you

26:17.459 --> 26:19.126
But you've always treated her like a dude

26:20.542 --> 26:22.084
Is it that obvious?

26:22.959 --> 26:25.417
But she's really like a bro to me

26:26.542 --> 26:27.834
Fine, then

26:28.584 --> 26:30.334
Has she ever peed standing next to you?

26:30.334 --> 26:31.917
Do you two ever flirt with chicks together?

26:31.917 --> 26:33.042
The thing is

26:33.042 --> 26:35.876
I think of her as my bro from day one

26:36.126 --> 26:37.709
There's nothing ladylike about her

26:38.001 --> 26:39.459
I'm a dude, you know

26:39.459 --> 26:41.376
I like sweet girls

26:42.126 --> 26:43.792
If I were into butch girls

26:44.334 --> 26:45.751
I might as well date a guy

26:46.501 --> 26:47.459
Stop it

26:48.542 --> 26:49.542
Nah

26:50.376 --> 26:52.251
These dating apps

26:52.251 --> 26:54.167
Are for men

26:55.167 --> 26:56.834
What kind of girls would use them?

26:59.959 --> 27:01.209
Normal girls

27:02.626 --> 27:03.667
I'm telling you

27:04.001 --> 27:06.126
Flirting is like being an assassin

27:06.126 --> 27:08.834
You start with long range weapons

27:08.917 --> 27:10.209
Like a sniper rifle

27:10.209 --> 27:11.417
Keep your distance from the target

27:11.417 --> 27:13.917
So that your attack wouldn't backfire

27:14.167 --> 27:14.959
Now

27:14.959 --> 27:16.084
Let's get started

27:16.084 --> 27:17.959
With the basics - texting

27:17.959 --> 27:20.126
I can text Marco right now

27:20.126 --> 27:22.917
Why do I have to flirt with other men?

27:23.167 --> 27:25.459
Unless you practice with strangers

27:25.459 --> 27:27.209
You'll never know what your weaknesses are

27:27.209 --> 27:29.084
Not to mention...

27:29.084 --> 27:30.459
Most men using these apps are otaku

27:30.459 --> 27:32.001
They're pretty easy to deal with

27:32.001 --> 27:33.792
Here, I did the installation

27:34.126 --> 27:35.251
Take a picture first

27:38.209 --> 27:40.126
- Delete it
- Why?

27:40.126 --> 27:42.209
You think your double chin is sexy?

27:42.209 --> 27:44.501
It's just a selfie

27:45.542 --> 27:47.001
- Watch
- And learn

27:48.251 --> 27:50.001
High angle, chin down

27:50.001 --> 27:51.417
Look up a little

27:51.417 --> 27:53.209
Try to look innocent

27:53.209 --> 27:54.667
That's the standard pose

27:54.667 --> 27:55.709
Learn it well!

27:56.376 --> 27:58.417
This is really lame

27:59.209 --> 28:02.126
- But guys love it
- So learn it well

28:02.126 --> 28:04.084
There're three things you should remember

28:04.084 --> 28:05.667
Angle, angle and angle

28:05.667 --> 28:06.792
Hurry up

28:07.292 --> 28:08.042
High angle

28:08.042 --> 28:09.376
A bit higher

28:09.584 --> 28:12.001
- Higher still
- Chin down

28:12.001 --> 28:13.501
Look up a little

28:13.501 --> 28:15.917
- Chin down
- Act innocent

28:15.917 --> 28:17.626
Make a pitiful face like an orphan

28:17.626 --> 28:20.209
Now snap

28:22.376 --> 28:23.417
Let's see

28:23.542 --> 28:25.709
Always retouch your photos

28:25.959 --> 28:26.917
Give her a hand

28:27.542 --> 28:29.626
See if there's any guy around worth shagging

28:30.084 --> 28:31.167
Or chatting with

28:31.917 --> 28:33.001
Here you go. Hit it

28:34.626 --> 28:36.084
He's hot!

28:36.209 --> 28:37.584
Wow

28:38.501 --> 28:39.334
People are actually responding

28:39.334 --> 28:40.751
(You've added Wolf as a friend. Start chatting)

28:40.751 --> 28:42.251
Are they jobless or something?

28:43.167 --> 28:43.876
What should I say?

28:43.876 --> 28:46.251
- Whatever you want
- This guy's cute

28:48.667 --> 28:50.001
Hi

28:50.917 --> 28:52.876
My name's Angie

28:54.042 --> 28:55.751
Wait, are you having a job interview?

28:55.834 --> 28:57.501
How do you expect him to reply?

28:57.709 --> 28:59.876
Always start with a question

29:00.334 --> 29:02.209
Ask him, "What are you doing?"

29:02.917 --> 29:04.001
What are you doing?

29:04.709 --> 29:07.709
What are you doing?

29:08.542 --> 29:10.959
(I'm wondering who's missing me now)

29:10.959 --> 29:13.584
(Should I down Louis XIII or Kinmen Liquor?)

29:13.584 --> 29:16.626
(Yeah I'm doing it. Wanna join?)

29:17.959 --> 29:20.126
Wait. Hold on

29:20.334 --> 29:23.334
Remember, don't flirt like a loyal dog

29:23.334 --> 29:24.751
You know what cats do?

29:24.876 --> 29:27.584
They tease you

29:27.584 --> 29:28.792
And ignore you when you warm up to them

29:28.959 --> 29:29.667
In a nutshell

29:29.667 --> 29:31.542
Be passive aggressive

29:31.542 --> 29:32.834
So should I reply him or not?

29:33.042 --> 29:34.292
Think about what you wanna say

29:34.417 --> 29:35.667
And reply him tonight

29:47.292 --> 29:50.209
(I dunno, but you sound like you miss me)

29:53.584 --> 29:56.542
(Louis XIII's been dead for ages)

29:58.959 --> 30:02.084
(Yeah I'm doing it. Wanna join?)

30:20.126 --> 30:22.501
(Jerk)

30:27.292 --> 30:30.584
(Who? I'll beat him for you)

30:35.001 --> 30:37.167
(Then slap yourself 3 times)

30:43.251 --> 30:45.667
(I'm not a jerk. I'm nice)

30:52.626 --> 30:53.876
You're good at drawing

30:54.709 --> 30:56.417
Why haven't you drawn me anything before?

30:56.417 --> 30:58.459
Why haven't you drawn for me?

31:03.751 --> 31:05.501
That's amazing!

31:06.251 --> 31:07.834
You're so awesome!

31:07.834 --> 31:09.167
Angie drew them

31:09.834 --> 31:11.459
When we were in college

31:11.626 --> 31:13.251
Whenever she got bored

31:13.251 --> 31:15.167
She'd draw on my notebook

31:23.584 --> 31:25.709
I'm sure there was something between you two

31:25.917 --> 31:28.834
Of course not, she's a dude

31:28.834 --> 31:30.709
Then why do you still have this

31:30.917 --> 31:32.251
Next to your bed?

31:32.251 --> 31:34.792
Cause there's nothing between us

31:34.792 --> 31:36.459
Absolutely nothing

31:36.459 --> 31:38.417
I don't have to hide it from you

31:39.792 --> 31:41.251
Hey, don't be upset

31:42.709 --> 31:43.917
What's wrong?

31:43.917 --> 31:45.084
I just don't like it

31:53.584 --> 31:55.626
Alright, don't be mad

31:56.584 --> 31:57.834
Don't be mad, please

31:58.042 --> 31:59.584
Let me show you something

32:00.459 --> 32:01.542
What?

32:04.376 --> 32:05.584
Put your hand inside

32:05.917 --> 32:07.001
Quick

32:07.126 --> 32:09.376
What is it?

32:09.376 --> 32:10.584
A bit lower

32:11.334 --> 32:12.501
Lower

32:13.376 --> 32:14.959
Lower

32:15.126 --> 32:16.626
Lower still

32:17.626 --> 32:19.626
You feel something hard?

32:20.959 --> 32:22.251
Grab it and pull it out

32:25.167 --> 32:27.001
What's this?

32:27.001 --> 32:28.626
You told me you wanna cycle all the way

32:28.626 --> 32:30.959
Around Taiwan with your friends

32:31.626 --> 32:33.292
My leave application got rejected

32:33.959 --> 32:35.334
But I got you a ticket

32:35.542 --> 32:37.001
Have fun with your friends

32:38.959 --> 32:41.001
You're the best

32:54.334 --> 32:57.084
(What are you doing?)

32:58.459 --> 33:00.959
Do you wanna

33:00.959 --> 33:02.459
Get your hands

33:02.459 --> 33:05.626
On something else?

33:14.792 --> 33:16.334
(I'm with Hailey)

34:23.333 --> 34:26.001
I still remember the look on Angie's face...

34:30.126 --> 34:31.333
When she draws. It's adorable

34:33.626 --> 34:35.251
I've asked myself before

34:35.251 --> 34:37.083
Whether I should try to date her

34:38.083 --> 34:40.208
But somehow we're like parallel lines

34:40.417 --> 34:43.042
No matter how close we are, we never meet

34:50.417 --> 34:52.292
Enough texting

34:53.376 --> 34:55.542
Time to do some training on the ground

34:56.458 --> 34:57.501
Go!

35:05.792 --> 35:06.876
Angie

35:09.334 --> 35:10.417
Quick, say something

35:10.417 --> 35:11.084
I'm Mike

35:11.084 --> 35:13.709
Keep your head up. Your double chin's showing

35:18.417 --> 35:20.417
Just say something

35:21.084 --> 35:23.042
- Quick
- Expats are great

35:23.751 --> 35:25.834
- I love them
- Same here

35:26.417 --> 35:28.626
I don't really care

35:28.626 --> 35:30.876
As long as he's got a big nose

35:35.417 --> 35:36.376
Hey

35:37.126 --> 35:38.709
What should I say to him?

35:38.709 --> 35:40.376
The key to flirting is

35:40.376 --> 35:41.709
Just pretend you like whatever the guy's saying

35:41.709 --> 35:43.626
Whatever he says, just do this

35:44.084 --> 35:45.251
Oh, really?

35:45.251 --> 35:46.876
Tell me, please

35:46.876 --> 35:48.292
I hate you

35:48.292 --> 35:49.709
I have no idea

35:49.709 --> 35:51.001
It works every time

35:51.542 --> 35:52.584
Go ahead

35:54.334 --> 35:55.376
Hey

35:59.001 --> 36:00.542
Do you know how to play?

36:02.584 --> 36:04.084
I have no idea

36:04.084 --> 36:05.626
No problem. I'll teach you

36:05.959 --> 36:07.501
But today is your first lesson

36:07.501 --> 36:09.751
That's okay, I can teach you anyway

36:09.751 --> 36:10.917
Your hand...

36:10.959 --> 36:12.126
Feels really cold

36:12.334 --> 36:13.459
Oops

36:13.459 --> 36:14.626
Sorry

36:15.834 --> 36:17.167
I forgot to tell you my secret identity

36:17.167 --> 36:18.376
I'm Mr. Freeze

36:18.542 --> 36:20.876
These hands make great sushi

36:20.876 --> 36:21.959
Really?

36:22.209 --> 36:24.042
I love sushi

36:24.334 --> 36:26.584
When can I get a taste of your sushi?

36:28.126 --> 36:29.709
I'm afraid

36:29.709 --> 36:31.209
There won't be a chance

36:31.209 --> 36:33.001
The sushi business is shrinking

36:33.001 --> 36:34.126
The market is too small

36:34.501 --> 36:36.126
I did some research

36:36.126 --> 36:37.126
And I thought

36:37.126 --> 36:39.542
I'd be better off working as a makeup artist

36:41.084 --> 36:42.459
I'm straight though

36:42.459 --> 36:44.376
Super straight. No worries

36:46.292 --> 36:48.709
Place your left hand over your right hand

36:48.709 --> 36:50.042
The trick is

36:50.167 --> 36:51.792
To thrust your hip

36:51.792 --> 36:54.001
Good, nice. Now thrust it

36:57.709 --> 37:00.126
That's my cell

37:02.042 --> 37:03.042
Really?

37:03.042 --> 37:04.542
Yes, it's just my cell

37:04.709 --> 37:06.084
Now, pay attention

37:06.084 --> 37:08.834
Watch your hands. Focus on the ball

37:08.834 --> 37:09.876
Look down

37:10.584 --> 37:11.917
And thrust your hip

37:11.917 --> 37:14.584
Good, very good

37:14.709 --> 37:16.292
Let me do it on my own

37:16.292 --> 37:18.501
- You don't have to help me
- Alright. Go ahead

37:23.876 --> 37:25.334
So...

37:25.334 --> 37:27.751
You must know a lot of pretty girls

37:29.167 --> 37:30.084
Not really

37:30.084 --> 37:33.292
Company policy forbids us from dating clients

37:33.292 --> 37:34.459
I don't believe you

37:34.959 --> 37:37.584
If they like your work

37:37.584 --> 37:39.792
They would love to see you again

37:39.792 --> 37:41.959
If they come and see me again

37:41.959 --> 37:43.376
Then I'm in trouble

37:44.417 --> 37:46.876
What do you think of my makeup today?

37:46.876 --> 37:47.959
Your makeup?

37:49.792 --> 37:50.876
It's nice

37:51.542 --> 37:53.584
You look better than my clients

37:53.584 --> 37:55.584
- You're kidding
- No

37:55.584 --> 37:57.084
It's obvious

37:57.084 --> 37:59.959
You look healthy

38:00.209 --> 38:02.209
My clients

38:02.209 --> 38:04.501
They all look pale

38:04.501 --> 38:06.376
I met a client this morning

38:06.376 --> 38:07.751
She got her face caved in

38:07.751 --> 38:10.751
I had no idea what she was thinking

38:10.751 --> 38:11.917
She could've picked a better place to land

38:11.917 --> 38:13.292
When she jumped off that building

38:13.292 --> 38:14.376
Why on earth

38:14.376 --> 38:16.709
Would she land on a concrete slab?

38:16.709 --> 38:18.751
What was I supposed to do with her face?

38:19.126 --> 38:21.459
You put makeup on dead people?

38:22.459 --> 38:24.667
You shouldn't put it like that

38:24.876 --> 38:27.501
I'm a "Makeup Consultant" for the deceased

38:27.876 --> 38:29.167
Let me tell you a secret

38:29.959 --> 38:31.042
Eh?

38:31.209 --> 38:33.376
Tell me, please

38:33.792 --> 38:35.209
Have you heard of

38:35.667 --> 38:37.167
Rocket poop?

38:38.584 --> 38:39.709
What?

38:40.292 --> 38:41.667
Really?

38:41.917 --> 38:43.084
I was driving one night

38:43.084 --> 38:46.084
Suddenly my stomach started to hurt

38:46.084 --> 38:48.292
I reached an intersection.
There was nobody around

38:48.292 --> 38:50.667
I pulled over, came out of the car

38:51.084 --> 38:52.792
And pooped on the spot

38:52.876 --> 38:54.709
It felt amazing

38:54.709 --> 38:56.417
You know what happened next?

38:58.709 --> 39:00.709
I have no idea

39:00.709 --> 39:03.084
Pooping in a toilet is one thing

39:03.084 --> 39:04.751
But when you poop on the ground

39:04.751 --> 39:06.584
When you push really hard

39:06.584 --> 39:07.459
The poop that comes out...

39:07.459 --> 39:09.501
It would push you upward

39:10.209 --> 39:12.751
Once I was done, I got back to the car

39:12.751 --> 39:14.417
I turned and looked

39:14.417 --> 39:16.917
Gosh, my poop was just standing there

39:16.917 --> 39:18.459
Like a monument or something

39:18.459 --> 39:20.917
Right at the intersection. It was L-shaped

39:23.042 --> 39:24.459
I hate you!

39:28.501 --> 39:29.626
Listen

39:31.292 --> 39:33.251
If we get together

39:33.751 --> 39:35.501
you have to promise me

39:36.126 --> 39:37.917
No matter how much we fight

39:38.126 --> 39:40.417
You'll never jump off a building

39:40.542 --> 39:41.959
But if you really wanna, let's say...

39:41.959 --> 39:43.167
Jump off a building

39:43.167 --> 39:44.751
Make sure you land on grass

39:45.209 --> 39:46.959
It's much softer

39:49.209 --> 39:50.667
I hate you!

39:56.709 --> 39:58.209
Angie...

40:04.084 --> 40:05.792
What did I do wrong?

40:06.751 --> 40:07.792
It's the way you say

40:07.792 --> 40:09.084
"I hate you"

40:10.042 --> 40:11.459
But I learned it from you

40:11.792 --> 40:12.501
Where did I go wrong?

40:12.501 --> 40:14.001
When you flirt

40:14.001 --> 40:15.834
You gotta sugarcoat

40:15.834 --> 40:17.542
Even when you're insulting the guy

40:18.334 --> 40:19.876
I hate you

40:20.376 --> 40:21.834
Stop it

40:22.292 --> 40:23.584
Go away

40:23.667 --> 40:25.459
If you look him in the eye and say

40:25.459 --> 40:26.626
I hate you!

40:27.126 --> 40:28.501
Then you're screwed

40:28.917 --> 40:30.584
But my mom used to say we should always

40:30.584 --> 40:33.251
Look people in the eye when we talk to them

40:37.917 --> 40:40.084
I hate you

40:43.001 --> 40:45.792
I hate you

40:47.459 --> 40:49.834
I hate you

40:50.876 --> 40:52.834
I hate you

40:52.959 --> 40:57.209
I hate you

40:57.417 --> 40:59.376
I hate you

40:59.376 --> 41:00.334
Hey you!

41:01.209 --> 41:02.667
You're stealing my oranges again

41:03.042 --> 41:05.667
Oops, we didn't do it on purpose

41:05.667 --> 41:07.876
We didn't know they were yours

41:07.876 --> 41:09.959
We had no idea

41:11.001 --> 41:12.959
I just wanna get a taste

41:12.959 --> 41:15.459
They're so expensive

41:15.459 --> 41:17.667
Alright, just don't take them all

41:17.667 --> 41:20.501
- You're the best!
- Thank you

41:21.751 --> 41:23.501
You gotta be kidding me

41:23.501 --> 41:25.501
Where have you been?

41:26.376 --> 41:28.959
This is the power of flirting

41:31.584 --> 41:33.834
I hate you

41:36.292 --> 41:43.084
I hate you

41:43.209 --> 41:44.376
Am I doing it right?

41:44.376 --> 41:46.084
Hey, I'm getting better at this, right?

41:46.084 --> 41:48.167
- Yes, much better
- I hate you

41:48.209 --> 41:50.209
I hate you

41:50.209 --> 41:51.917
Wow, that's a big one

41:53.667 --> 41:56.376
I hate you

42:24.292 --> 42:29.084
(IOU Coupon)

42:49.751 --> 42:51.001
What do you see?

42:52.667 --> 42:53.709
Cows

42:55.459 --> 42:58.084
Lots of cows piled into a huge baby

42:58.084 --> 42:59.292
It kinda stinks like...

42:59.959 --> 43:01.126
Bullshit

43:01.542 --> 43:02.542
No?

43:06.501 --> 43:08.917
This is art. Show some respect

43:13.084 --> 43:14.667
Our professor used to say

43:14.667 --> 43:17.334
You have talent in art

43:17.501 --> 43:19.167
But you gave that all up for Marco

43:19.376 --> 43:20.459
Was it worth it?

43:21.292 --> 43:23.376
I wanted to be with him

43:23.376 --> 43:25.542
So I got a job in Shanghai

43:27.126 --> 43:28.792
If you could choose again

43:28.792 --> 43:30.792
Would you stay and work here

43:30.792 --> 43:32.501
Or continue with your sculpting?

43:36.209 --> 43:37.376
I don't know

43:38.834 --> 43:41.292
I really don't know

43:41.292 --> 43:44.459
What do you like about him?

43:45.209 --> 43:47.417
He's cute, don't you think?

43:47.792 --> 43:50.751
He cares about me,
and he shows it in funny ways

43:55.209 --> 43:56.626
What was that?

43:56.751 --> 43:59.501
You're a girl. Cover your mouth when you yawn

43:59.626 --> 44:01.876
Stuffing your mouth?
That's what you call "caring"?

44:04.751 --> 44:06.167
Well then, I know a lot of guys

44:06.167 --> 44:07.542
Who care about me

44:09.501 --> 44:11.376
You can't go head to head with that bitch

44:11.376 --> 44:13.001
You don't have what it takes

44:13.167 --> 44:14.667
You'll just fight a losing battle

44:19.501 --> 44:20.834
Hi

44:21.292 --> 44:23.334
Do you miss silly goose?

44:23.751 --> 44:25.959
I miss you every night

44:25.959 --> 44:28.126
So much that I'd cry

44:28.667 --> 44:30.376
I hate you

44:30.709 --> 44:33.709
Alright, I gotta go

44:34.084 --> 44:35.667
See you tonight

44:36.417 --> 44:38.042
Bye

44:39.209 --> 44:40.251
Where were we?

44:40.876 --> 44:41.959
I'm fighting a losing battle

44:41.959 --> 44:43.459
Oh yes

44:43.459 --> 44:46.209
Well, she's out of town now. Grab the chance.

44:46.209 --> 44:47.459
Tell Marco you like him

44:47.459 --> 44:48.876
No way

44:48.876 --> 44:50.584
I've known him for years

44:50.917 --> 44:53.084
He's always treated me like a dude

44:53.084 --> 44:54.334
I wouldn't know what to say

44:55.084 --> 44:57.917
What's the best time to have an office romance?

44:58.834 --> 44:59.876
Enlighten me

45:00.292 --> 45:01.626
Business trips

45:16.334 --> 45:19.167
My leggies miss you

45:20.792 --> 45:22.251
Tell them

45:22.542 --> 45:24.834
I miss them too

45:28.334 --> 45:30.667
(IOU Coupon)

45:34.542 --> 45:36.042
No way!

45:36.751 --> 45:38.626
You still have it with you?

45:40.417 --> 45:41.959
Come and see the Ju Ming exhibition with me

45:42.584 --> 45:43.542
What?

45:43.626 --> 45:45.084
He's having an exhibition in Shanghai?

45:45.417 --> 45:47.334
No, we're going to Taipei

45:48.292 --> 45:49.792
Why?

45:50.876 --> 45:53.126
We have a case in Taipei

45:53.459 --> 45:54.751
I got you two days off

45:54.876 --> 45:56.542
So come with me, okay?

45:57.917 --> 45:59.417
But you didn't approve my leave last time

45:59.417 --> 46:00.626
Why's that?

46:01.417 --> 46:03.126
Why would I let you emasculate yourself

46:03.126 --> 46:05.209
And do everything that princess wants?

46:06.917 --> 46:08.126
What about now?

46:08.126 --> 46:09.251
Now's the time...

46:10.001 --> 46:11.667
For you to return all the favors I did you

46:25.417 --> 46:28.667
Define the law of diminishing returns

46:29.751 --> 46:31.751
Within a certain period of time...

46:32.292 --> 46:37.292
Consumer goods would...

46:37.292 --> 46:39.876
As the number of goods increases...

46:40.376 --> 46:47.334
Consumers would...

46:48.792 --> 46:50.334
What?

46:50.584 --> 46:53.376
I'm so tired!

46:53.376 --> 46:54.959
Let me take a nap

46:54.959 --> 46:56.459
Please!

46:58.292 --> 46:59.792
No, you pighead!

46:59.792 --> 47:02.334
Cause I'm stuck here with you,
I missed the Ju Ming exhibition

47:02.334 --> 47:03.501
Wake up!

47:14.209 --> 47:15.251
What's this?

47:15.876 --> 47:18.084
I know you're doing all this for me

47:18.834 --> 47:21.417
I promise I'll make it up to you one day

47:21.417 --> 47:23.667
(IOU Coupon)

47:23.667 --> 47:25.376
Just let me take a nap

47:26.292 --> 47:27.584
Please

47:41.501 --> 47:43.167
Hey, we got you a survival kit

47:43.167 --> 47:45.542
For your trip

47:49.584 --> 47:50.792
Look at this

47:50.792 --> 47:52.376
That's a lot

47:52.542 --> 47:54.292
Well, you're spending a few nights with him

47:54.292 --> 47:56.001
There's more

48:00.417 --> 48:03.084
This is way too much

48:03.709 --> 48:05.792
Not at all

48:05.792 --> 48:07.751
Wait till you see what she got you

48:11.084 --> 48:12.126
What's that?

48:12.126 --> 48:13.667
Undies

48:16.834 --> 48:18.376
Do people actually wear that?

48:18.376 --> 48:19.584
Try it on

48:19.584 --> 48:22.376
They look like flying guillotines

48:28.417 --> 48:29.834
I hate you

48:30.584 --> 48:32.501
- What?
- You just nailed it

48:33.084 --> 48:34.334
It sounds just right

48:34.334 --> 48:35.459
Do it again

48:37.376 --> 48:38.876
I hate you

48:40.251 --> 48:41.126
Not so good. Again

48:41.126 --> 48:42.876
Get in the mood

48:43.667 --> 48:44.834
I hate you

48:45.334 --> 48:46.334
You're almost there

48:46.334 --> 48:47.876
- Again, again
- I hate you

48:50.417 --> 48:53.501
- Again
- I hate you

48:54.334 --> 48:56.126
I hate you

48:57.042 --> 48:58.376
Thanks, y'all

48:58.584 --> 49:00.501
- Good luck!
- You can do it

49:00.501 --> 49:01.792
- Go!
- Yeah!

49:11.959 --> 49:14.751
You wanna beat that bitch? Learn from her

49:15.209 --> 49:16.959
Sleep on his shoulder

49:20.334 --> 49:22.001
You know what, sleeping on his shoulders...

49:22.001 --> 49:23.542
It's just not doable

49:23.876 --> 49:25.667
Why do I have to copy the things
that bitch does?

49:25.667 --> 49:28.834
Ma'am, please turn off your cell phone.
Thank you

49:32.001 --> 49:33.376
Did you just call somebody a bitch?

49:34.751 --> 49:35.876
What? No

49:39.459 --> 49:42.834
Well, I was asking the flight attendant

49:43.167 --> 49:45.126
If there's any...

49:45.667 --> 49:46.917
Beach

49:48.084 --> 49:49.042
In Taipei

49:54.084 --> 49:55.167
By the way

49:55.584 --> 49:57.834
Don't tweet anything during the trip

49:57.834 --> 49:59.001
Hailey might get the wrong idea

49:59.001 --> 50:00.626
I told her I couldn't leave work

50:00.626 --> 50:01.584
Now I'm going to Taipei

50:01.584 --> 50:03.876
She'd think I ditched her on purpose

50:06.251 --> 50:07.501
Why would she think that?

50:07.501 --> 50:09.626
You're here because you owe me

50:30.626 --> 50:32.751
Isn't he a jerk?

50:33.001 --> 50:34.084
Well

50:34.709 --> 50:36.084
Think about it

50:36.292 --> 50:38.501
He's asking you to be discreet

50:38.959 --> 50:40.417
If he doesn't have feelings for you

50:40.417 --> 50:41.667
He wouldn't do that

50:41.667 --> 50:42.542
Be more aggressive

50:42.542 --> 50:43.876
How?

50:44.792 --> 50:46.251
That'd be embarrassing

50:46.751 --> 50:48.917
We're waging war, girl. Can't play it safe

50:49.417 --> 50:51.501
There will be blood

50:51.626 --> 50:52.501
Trust me

50:52.501 --> 50:54.042
Get out of your comfort zone

50:54.376 --> 50:55.459
Men...

50:55.459 --> 50:57.209
Are like a pile of hay

50:58.042 --> 50:59.542
Give them a match

51:00.126 --> 51:01.501
And they'll burn themselves up

51:01.501 --> 51:02.876
Anyway, I gotta go

51:03.084 --> 51:05.167
Maybe you should watch porn with him

51:07.084 --> 51:08.876
That's kinda hard to pull off

51:09.542 --> 51:11.001
Let me think about it

51:25.959 --> 51:27.667
I wanna try that!

51:27.667 --> 51:28.834
What?

51:30.542 --> 51:32.417
- Can I have one?
- Of course

51:32.876 --> 51:34.334
- How much?
- 50 TWD

51:34.334 --> 51:35.584
Thank you

51:35.792 --> 51:36.834
- Welcome
- Thanks

51:37.542 --> 51:39.376
Pairing tomatoes with prunes

51:39.376 --> 51:40.542
Have a bite

51:40.667 --> 51:42.501
- Is it good?
- It's really good, c'mon

51:52.167 --> 51:53.792
Who came up with this idea?

51:54.292 --> 51:56.709
Pairing tomatoes with prunes?

51:56.709 --> 51:58.334
They don't seem to match

51:59.417 --> 52:00.917
Whoever did this is a genius

52:01.917 --> 52:04.667
Cut the tomato in half, and stuff in a prune

52:05.167 --> 52:06.709
How did he come up with it?

52:07.917 --> 52:09.251
Maybe

52:10.042 --> 52:11.959
He was eating prunes

52:11.959 --> 52:14.876
And then someone offered him a tomato

52:15.626 --> 52:17.209
He mixed the flavors together

52:17.209 --> 52:19.667
Found it amazing

52:19.667 --> 52:20.501
And came up with the recipe

52:20.501 --> 52:22.376
- Wow!
- Wow!

52:22.376 --> 52:23.584
That's a lot of red beans

52:25.709 --> 52:26.751
They should register this

52:27.209 --> 52:29.042
As intangible cultural heritage

52:29.084 --> 52:30.626
With the UN

52:31.167 --> 52:32.626
You're crazy

52:32.667 --> 52:34.334
Wow! Cotton candy!

52:34.626 --> 52:35.959
And it's blue!

52:36.251 --> 52:37.626
- What?
- I wanna play!

52:37.792 --> 52:39.126
- Eh?
- I wanna ride this

52:45.709 --> 52:48.001
- This one
- It's for kids

52:48.001 --> 52:49.584
So what?

52:49.584 --> 52:50.792
Forget it

52:50.792 --> 52:53.126
Look, they're all playing

52:57.876 --> 52:59.126
You take this one

52:59.417 --> 53:01.167
It's perfect for you

53:01.959 --> 53:03.126
Get on

53:04.209 --> 53:05.542
- Come on
- Seriously?

53:05.542 --> 53:06.667
Seriously

53:15.876 --> 53:17.001
Hey you!

53:17.292 --> 53:18.792
These are for kids

53:18.792 --> 53:20.792
You grown-ups would break them

53:22.209 --> 53:23.584
Excuse me, sir

53:24.084 --> 53:25.584
He's my brother

53:25.751 --> 53:27.126
He's retarded

53:27.292 --> 53:29.709
He loves riding this thing

53:29.709 --> 53:32.251
If you don't let him

53:32.251 --> 53:34.959
He'll get upset. Please

53:35.751 --> 53:36.959
Doo-doo

53:37.251 --> 53:38.834
He'll poop right here

53:38.834 --> 53:40.834
- Pee-pee
- Please

53:41.084 --> 53:43.126
Doo-doo, doo-doo

53:43.126 --> 53:44.792
- Ma'am
- Doo-doo

53:44.792 --> 53:47.167
Please don't do that to your boyfriend

53:47.167 --> 53:48.501
He's trying so hard to please you

53:48.626 --> 53:50.792
He's obviously not retarded

53:51.126 --> 53:52.209
Oops

53:52.209 --> 53:53.376
So you can tell?

53:53.376 --> 53:54.584
Of course

53:54.584 --> 53:56.126
I'm not retarded

53:57.292 --> 53:59.167
Go ahead. I gotta doo doo

53:59.167 --> 54:01.209
- Thank you
- Thank you so much

54:08.376 --> 54:10.376
Open you mouth

54:17.917 --> 54:19.167
Let's take another one

54:20.417 --> 54:22.667
One, two, cheese!

54:28.417 --> 54:30.209
What's up? Are you done?

54:30.209 --> 54:31.667
Any update?

54:32.584 --> 54:34.376
What's the noise?

54:34.376 --> 54:36.876
We're riding the plane

54:37.042 --> 54:38.917
Is that some kinda fancy position?

54:38.917 --> 54:40.792
Stop it

54:41.417 --> 54:42.667
Time's running out

54:43.292 --> 54:46.501
When that bitch comes... back

54:46.501 --> 54:47.876
Then it's all over for you

54:47.876 --> 54:49.501
Grab your chance now

54:49.501 --> 54:50.709
Can you be more specific?

54:51.167 --> 54:53.042
You know what men like?

54:53.167 --> 54:54.792
Kinky girls

54:58.042 --> 55:01.292
Okay, I'll try

55:01.292 --> 55:03.501
Okay, bye bye

55:04.542 --> 55:05.792
Bye

55:08.209 --> 55:09.501
Nice pussy

55:11.876 --> 55:14.584
There you are

55:14.584 --> 55:16.334
Thanks for finding my pussy

55:16.334 --> 55:17.459
My pleasure

55:38.209 --> 55:39.334
Here I come!

55:58.084 --> 55:59.292
I'm going back to my room

56:00.626 --> 56:01.709
See you tomorrow

56:04.876 --> 56:05.959
Good night

56:06.167 --> 56:07.334
You too

56:16.667 --> 56:17.667
Hey!

56:18.667 --> 56:19.959
Sleep tight

57:11.667 --> 57:12.751
What's up?

57:13.334 --> 57:14.834
Wanna watch some porn?

57:20.959 --> 57:22.001
Come

57:34.042 --> 57:37.251
There isn't any adult channel on this thing

57:37.792 --> 57:39.709
And they say Taiwan is a decadent place?

57:41.751 --> 57:43.376
I'm going back then

57:43.376 --> 57:45.334
Wait, I have an idea

57:46.001 --> 57:47.209
It should be easy

57:54.709 --> 57:55.917
Alright

57:56.584 --> 57:57.751
What's this?

57:58.042 --> 58:00.834
Curling. We used to watch this in the dorm

58:00.834 --> 58:02.626
It's just like

58:02.626 --> 58:04.042
Watching porn

58:04.542 --> 58:05.709
No way

58:06.376 --> 58:07.834
Give it a try

58:08.209 --> 58:09.251
Close your eyes

58:20.876 --> 58:22.501
Right?

58:27.751 --> 58:29.834
But it sounds exhausting

58:30.417 --> 58:32.667
Well, each national team has its own style

58:33.084 --> 58:37.251
With the Europeans and Americans, for example

58:37.251 --> 58:38.459
There's a sense of joy and excitement

58:39.376 --> 58:41.959
The Japanese, on the other hand

58:42.084 --> 58:43.542
When they moan, you can feel a kinda pain

58:43.542 --> 58:47.584
But there's also a sense of desire

58:48.167 --> 58:50.167
Oh no, please stop

58:50.542 --> 58:52.126
Aww, gimme more

58:52.334 --> 58:54.251
Stop, please

59:03.792 --> 59:05.042
I'm tired

59:05.251 --> 59:06.376
Good night

01:00:20.084 --> 01:00:21.917
It's raining so hard

01:00:22.292 --> 01:00:24.792
Should we go or wait here?

01:00:26.751 --> 01:00:28.042
Let's wait here

01:00:37.584 --> 01:00:42.209
(Feeling like a kid again
in Taipei night market)

01:00:53.251 --> 01:00:56.417
Excuse me. I'm going to the Juming Museum

01:00:56.417 --> 01:00:58.084
Should I take the bus here?

01:00:59.667 --> 01:01:01.084
Yes

01:01:01.084 --> 01:01:03.876
Just take the bus from Taipei to Jinshan

01:01:03.876 --> 01:01:05.501
Thanks

01:01:11.251 --> 01:01:12.584
Baby, calm down

01:01:13.292 --> 01:01:14.417
Please don't cry

01:01:18.126 --> 01:01:19.709
We should wait here

01:01:20.417 --> 01:01:21.376
Alright

01:01:21.709 --> 01:01:23.251
Send me your address

01:01:25.084 --> 01:01:26.251
Okay, bye

01:01:28.334 --> 01:01:29.417
What's wrong?

01:01:30.792 --> 01:01:32.126
I gotta go to Taichung

01:01:45.584 --> 01:01:47.459
You really don't have to come with me

01:01:47.626 --> 01:01:49.126
You should go to the exhibition

01:01:49.251 --> 01:01:51.084
We were supposed to see it together

01:01:51.084 --> 01:01:52.834
It'd be boring to go on my own

01:01:55.459 --> 01:01:57.001
What's wrong with Hailey?

01:01:57.292 --> 01:01:58.459
I don't know either

01:01:59.417 --> 01:02:00.876
She was crying terribly

01:02:01.334 --> 01:02:02.876
I guess she hurt her leg or something

01:02:10.792 --> 01:02:11.709
By the way

01:02:12.251 --> 01:02:14.209
You left this in my room last night

01:02:14.417 --> 01:02:15.584
What is it?

01:02:17.667 --> 01:02:18.792
It's...

01:02:20.334 --> 01:02:21.834
I'm surprised you don't know

01:02:21.834 --> 01:02:23.667
It's a flying guillotine

01:02:23.667 --> 01:02:24.626
What?

01:02:24.626 --> 01:02:27.334
Flying guillotine, you know

01:02:28.584 --> 01:02:30.126
Well, I went to...

01:02:30.626 --> 01:02:32.834
Watch a movie with a friend the other day...

01:02:33.084 --> 01:02:35.209
It's called "The Guillotines"

01:02:35.667 --> 01:02:36.792
This is just a souvenir

01:02:36.792 --> 01:02:39.042
They gave away at the cinema

01:02:39.626 --> 01:02:40.584
Oh

01:02:41.501 --> 01:02:43.542
No, it's okay. Just throw it away

01:03:08.667 --> 01:03:09.667
Babe

01:03:10.126 --> 01:03:11.084
Hubby

01:03:11.084 --> 01:03:12.167
Are you okay?

01:03:12.251 --> 01:03:13.959
Where did you get hurt?

01:03:14.667 --> 01:03:16.751
Here, look

01:03:17.667 --> 01:03:20.292
When I got up this morning

01:03:20.626 --> 01:03:22.792
I tripped and fell

01:03:23.126 --> 01:03:25.834
My friends all cycled on

01:03:25.834 --> 01:03:27.584
And left me here by myself

01:03:28.126 --> 01:03:31.334
Thank god you're here.
What would I do without you?

01:03:32.126 --> 01:03:33.292
Is that it?

01:03:34.584 --> 01:03:36.917
I was scared. I don't want any scars!

01:03:38.084 --> 01:03:41.667
Hubby, you told me you like my legs

01:03:42.292 --> 01:03:43.251
So...

01:03:43.334 --> 01:03:45.417
I was terrified

01:03:45.501 --> 01:03:49.501
If I get a scar on my leg
you won't like me anymore

01:03:49.501 --> 01:03:51.959
And then I got really sad

01:03:53.084 --> 01:03:55.751
I couldn't stop crying

01:03:59.251 --> 01:04:00.417
Don't be silly

01:04:01.126 --> 01:04:02.709
You think I'm that shallow?

01:04:03.459 --> 01:04:05.334
I won't leave you

01:04:05.542 --> 01:04:07.209
Even if you lose your legs

01:04:09.251 --> 01:04:10.501
Really?

01:04:10.501 --> 01:04:11.709
Of course

01:04:12.459 --> 01:04:13.584
You still got a nice rack

01:04:14.376 --> 01:04:15.584
Hey!

01:04:15.709 --> 01:04:17.542
I hate you

01:04:19.959 --> 01:04:21.376
I told you

01:04:21.376 --> 01:04:23.709
I just wanted a fling

01:04:24.876 --> 01:04:26.751
I've been seeing my girlfriend for 7 years

01:04:26.751 --> 01:04:28.042
She's wonderful

01:04:28.334 --> 01:04:30.001
Why would I wanna leave her?

01:04:36.542 --> 01:04:37.501
Fine

01:04:37.501 --> 01:04:39.334
I'll call her now and break up with her

01:04:49.042 --> 01:04:50.084
Hey

01:04:50.959 --> 01:04:52.209
That slutty bitch

01:04:52.209 --> 01:04:54.042
Must've read my tweet

01:04:54.042 --> 01:04:55.167
She's sabotaging my plan

01:04:56.501 --> 01:04:57.751
What are you gonna do then?

01:04:58.251 --> 01:05:00.209
She ruined my trip. I'll ruin hers

01:05:05.584 --> 01:05:06.876
Poor Hailey

01:05:07.042 --> 01:05:09.042
It really hurts, huh?

01:05:09.834 --> 01:05:11.459
I'm fine

01:05:11.917 --> 01:05:14.709
Hubby's here. It's alright now.

01:05:15.792 --> 01:05:16.876
Angie, dear

01:05:17.209 --> 01:05:19.126
You should go to the exhibition in Taipei

01:05:19.126 --> 01:05:20.126
Don't worry about me

01:05:20.126 --> 01:05:21.126
Okay?

01:05:21.626 --> 01:05:22.251
Hubby

01:05:22.251 --> 01:05:25.917
Let's walk Angie to the station, shall we?

01:05:26.042 --> 01:05:27.084
Sure

01:05:28.126 --> 01:05:29.834
- Hailey, dear
- Yes?

01:05:30.001 --> 01:05:32.167
Do you really hate me that much?

01:05:33.792 --> 01:05:36.584
What? Why?

01:05:36.792 --> 01:05:38.876
You're the best, Angie

01:05:38.876 --> 01:05:40.376
- Is that true?
- Yes

01:05:41.667 --> 01:05:44.542
Well, I love this place. It's really relaxing

01:05:44.542 --> 01:05:47.126
And I haven't gone cycling for so long

01:05:47.251 --> 01:05:48.334
Let's go cycling together

01:05:48.334 --> 01:05:50.501
What do you think?

01:05:51.251 --> 01:05:52.334
Marco?

01:05:53.251 --> 01:05:54.459
Sure!

01:05:54.751 --> 01:05:56.126
I'd like that

01:05:56.209 --> 01:05:59.209
It'd be fun to spend time with Angie

01:05:59.209 --> 01:06:01.792
- I'm so excited!
- Yeah!

01:06:01.792 --> 01:06:03.626
I'm thrilled that the three of us...

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:04.959
Are going cycling together!

01:06:04.959 --> 01:06:06.126
Great!

01:06:06.126 --> 01:06:09.209
- That's really great!
- I'm so thrilled!

01:06:10.209 --> 01:06:11.542
- Marco?
- Yes?

01:06:11.542 --> 01:06:13.792
We're going cycling together.
Aren't you excited?

01:06:13.792 --> 01:06:15.126
Yeah!

01:06:17.126 --> 01:06:18.417
Hey...

01:06:19.459 --> 01:06:21.292
Did you see the news?

01:06:21.292 --> 01:06:23.876
It's so lame

01:06:24.417 --> 01:06:26.084
There's this guy

01:06:26.084 --> 01:06:29.959
His friends gave him a can of soda

01:06:31.542 --> 01:06:32.751
Hold on...

01:06:33.292 --> 01:06:37.751
So he put it in the refrigerator

01:06:37.876 --> 01:06:41.126
After a few weeks

01:06:41.126 --> 01:06:43.376
He took it out

01:06:43.376 --> 01:06:45.251
For some reason

01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:47.542
The can just kept on swelling

01:06:47.542 --> 01:06:48.834
He didn't know what to do

01:06:48.834 --> 01:06:50.584
He didn't know how to get rid of it

01:06:50.584 --> 01:06:51.751
So he just...

01:06:52.001 --> 01:06:53.709
Kept holding it in his hands

01:06:53.709 --> 01:06:54.834
And finally the can just...

01:06:54.834 --> 01:06:56.751
Exploded!

01:06:56.834 --> 01:06:58.917
He got hit in the eye

01:07:04.251 --> 01:07:06.751
My tummy hurts so much. That's hilarious

01:07:06.751 --> 01:07:08.834
What's so funny about it?

01:07:09.709 --> 01:07:11.959
Maybe I'm a simple person

01:07:11.959 --> 01:07:14.042
I love to laugh

01:07:15.251 --> 01:07:16.542
Do you think it's funny?

01:07:17.209 --> 01:07:18.251
Eh?

01:07:19.084 --> 01:07:20.709
It's pretty funny

01:07:22.376 --> 01:07:23.917
Right?

01:07:23.917 --> 01:07:25.042
Yeah!

01:07:36.584 --> 01:07:38.667
He left it there for weeks...

01:07:51.834 --> 01:07:53.626
Hubby, I wanna eat those sausages

01:07:55.626 --> 01:07:57.417
- Hello
- Three, please

01:07:57.417 --> 01:07:59.959
- Okay
- I love street food

01:08:00.334 --> 01:08:01.709
I bet you like meatballs too?

01:08:01.709 --> 01:08:03.709
Eep! You're making me blush

01:08:03.709 --> 01:08:05.417
I meant chicken nuggets

01:08:05.917 --> 01:08:07.126
Let her go

01:08:07.251 --> 01:08:08.959
She had some last night

01:08:09.584 --> 01:08:11.542
Stop laughing!

01:08:13.542 --> 01:08:14.751
Here you go

01:08:15.167 --> 01:08:16.167
Thanks, hubby

01:08:16.959 --> 01:08:18.501
Would you like a sausage too?

01:08:41.376 --> 01:08:42.584
Hey, hubby

01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:44.459
I wanna drink green tea

01:08:44.459 --> 01:08:45.667
Can you go and buy it for me?

01:08:45.959 --> 01:08:46.959
Sure

01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:51.292
You want some?

01:08:51.626 --> 01:08:53.292
- Green tea?
- Yeah

01:08:53.292 --> 01:08:54.417
No!

01:09:07.126 --> 01:09:10.001
Angie, you're wasting your time

01:09:10.459 --> 01:09:12.209
No matter what you do

01:09:12.209 --> 01:09:13.959
Hubby will never fall for you

01:09:13.959 --> 01:09:15.209
Just give up

01:09:15.876 --> 01:09:17.251
Why are you so sure?

01:09:17.584 --> 01:09:19.292
Every boyfriend I've had

01:09:19.292 --> 01:09:20.959
Is stuck to me like glue

01:09:20.959 --> 01:09:24.376
I've seen women much younger
and sexier than you

01:09:24.376 --> 01:09:26.626
They flirt much better too

01:09:26.792 --> 01:09:28.334
None of them managed to take me down

01:09:29.126 --> 01:09:30.876
You actually had the guts
to come all the way here

01:09:30.876 --> 01:09:32.542
Look at yourself, for Christ's sake

01:09:33.876 --> 01:09:35.209
Don't be so sure

01:09:36.167 --> 01:09:38.126
When he kissed me in bed the other night

01:09:38.126 --> 01:09:40.209
It didn't seem like you were on his mind at all

01:09:44.292 --> 01:09:46.417
You think a one-night-stand would

01:09:46.417 --> 01:09:48.751
Turn the tides? You think I'd care?

01:09:49.667 --> 01:09:51.167
Men are all scumbags

01:09:52.209 --> 01:09:53.667
I don't give a damn

01:09:55.001 --> 01:09:56.334
To me...

01:09:56.917 --> 01:09:58.876
He's just a boy toy

01:09:59.292 --> 01:10:01.459
You're pretty. You know how to flirt

01:10:02.417 --> 01:10:04.001
If you're not really into him

01:10:04.001 --> 01:10:05.584
Why are you messing with him?

01:10:07.417 --> 01:10:08.834
To be honest

01:10:09.084 --> 01:10:12.084
I was just teasing him on the bus that day

01:10:12.626 --> 01:10:16.084
But then he couldn't stop talking about you

01:10:16.084 --> 01:10:17.584
I got really pissed off

01:10:18.584 --> 01:10:21.292
So I arranged a dinner

01:10:21.292 --> 01:10:23.376
To see who the hell you are

01:10:23.376 --> 01:10:25.042
That night he split your chopsticks for you

01:10:25.042 --> 01:10:26.667
Right in front of me

01:10:27.042 --> 01:10:28.751
I hate it when he's so nice to you

01:10:28.751 --> 01:10:30.251
Even when I'm just right next to him

01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:32.709
I decided right away to fight this battle

01:10:34.501 --> 01:10:36.292
Are you out of your mind?

01:10:36.959 --> 01:10:39.292
Love's not a competition

01:10:39.292 --> 01:10:41.084
That's what the losers say

01:10:41.542 --> 01:10:42.542
And I'm...

01:10:42.542 --> 01:10:44.292
not a loser

01:10:46.167 --> 01:10:47.959
You know what happened the other day?

01:10:47.959 --> 01:10:49.542
All I did was whine a little

01:10:49.792 --> 01:10:52.417
Then he got rid of that notebook

01:10:52.417 --> 01:10:54.001
With all your Ju Ming sketches

01:11:00.751 --> 01:11:02.167
Hubby!

01:11:03.084 --> 01:11:04.084
Hubby!

01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:06.626
What happened? Why are you crying?

01:11:07.876 --> 01:11:09.459
What's wrong? Don't cry, babe

01:11:09.459 --> 01:11:11.667
Don't cry

01:11:11.667 --> 01:11:12.626
Maybe

01:11:13.126 --> 01:11:15.459
I did something wrong

01:11:15.917 --> 01:11:17.542
And Angie got mad

01:11:17.542 --> 01:11:18.376
You lying bitch!

01:11:18.376 --> 01:11:19.709
Hey!

01:11:19.959 --> 01:11:21.751
Can you just stop picking on this little girl

01:11:21.751 --> 01:11:23.376
For my sake?

01:11:23.376 --> 01:11:24.417
Marco Gong

01:11:25.001 --> 01:11:26.417
I'm gonna ask you this only once

01:11:26.959 --> 01:11:28.167
Are you coming with me?

01:11:28.501 --> 01:11:29.751
Stop it

01:11:29.751 --> 01:11:31.001
Where do you want me to go?

01:11:39.376 --> 01:11:40.751
Where are you going?

01:11:41.084 --> 01:11:43.292
Hey! Where are you going?

01:11:46.542 --> 01:11:48.042
Don't cry

01:12:11.751 --> 01:12:13.001
Where are we going?

01:12:13.292 --> 01:12:14.667
Follow my direction

01:12:14.667 --> 01:12:15.626
Okay

01:12:16.376 --> 01:12:17.542
Right

01:12:19.417 --> 01:12:20.667
Left

01:12:21.792 --> 01:12:23.417
Right

01:12:25.251 --> 01:12:26.751
Left

01:12:57.084 --> 01:12:58.792
(Juming Museum)

01:13:12.626 --> 01:13:15.542
Ju Ming is famous for his chiseling

01:13:15.876 --> 01:13:17.251
It's sharp and quick

01:13:17.251 --> 01:13:18.542
It's effortless

01:13:19.917 --> 01:13:21.126
When I learned sculpting as a kid

01:13:21.126 --> 01:13:23.501
I always admired his quick, forceful strokes

01:13:23.584 --> 01:13:26.459
Because I hesitate too much when I work

01:13:31.834 --> 01:13:33.959
But not this time

01:13:34.709 --> 01:13:35.792
I jumped in with no thought

01:13:35.792 --> 01:13:38.084
But the chisel cut me up

01:13:38.876 --> 01:13:40.834
Until I couldn't recognize myself anymore

01:13:49.167 --> 01:13:50.917
But I'm made of flesh, not stone

01:13:51.376 --> 01:13:52.501
Does he know the pain

01:13:53.001 --> 01:13:54.709
He's caused me?

01:14:14.667 --> 01:14:16.292
You don't think she had an accident?

01:14:16.584 --> 01:14:18.042
I can't reach her

01:14:20.334 --> 01:14:22.876
She can take care of herself

01:14:23.792 --> 01:14:25.001
Don't worry

01:14:25.001 --> 01:14:26.876
She's never missed my call

01:14:27.751 --> 01:14:29.084
Maybe something happened to her

01:14:29.626 --> 01:14:30.917
I gotta go back to Taipei

01:14:32.251 --> 01:14:34.042
Don't go!

01:14:34.751 --> 01:14:36.501
Hubby!

01:14:36.834 --> 01:14:39.001
You came here to see me

01:14:39.667 --> 01:14:41.501
Not her

01:14:43.042 --> 01:14:44.376
Besides...

01:14:45.167 --> 01:14:47.626
She was bullying me

01:14:47.751 --> 01:14:49.917
How come you're on her side?

01:14:50.167 --> 01:14:51.959
What happened exactly?

01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:54.667
Why would she yell at you all of a sudden?

01:14:57.542 --> 01:14:59.542
I have no idea

01:15:03.001 --> 01:15:06.292
Maybe she's jealous?

01:15:07.709 --> 01:15:09.126
What did you say to her?

01:15:11.626 --> 01:15:13.292
Nothing

01:15:19.251 --> 01:15:22.334
I was just telling her

01:15:24.334 --> 01:15:27.292
No matter how close you two used to be

01:15:28.959 --> 01:15:31.501
You're my guy now

01:15:31.959 --> 01:15:33.084
So...

01:15:33.709 --> 01:15:35.584
I wouldn't let her fawn over you

01:15:36.126 --> 01:15:39.126
Don't even think about it

01:15:40.042 --> 01:15:42.709
It's nothing like that

01:15:42.959 --> 01:15:44.167
You're thinking too much

01:15:46.334 --> 01:15:47.751
I don't believe you

01:15:50.001 --> 01:15:52.709
When I told her you threw away

01:15:53.251 --> 01:15:55.334
That notebook with all her sketches

01:15:55.334 --> 01:15:56.584
Because of me

01:15:57.376 --> 01:15:58.876
I could tell from her face

01:15:58.876 --> 01:16:01.584
She's really into you

01:16:04.209 --> 01:16:05.209
What?

01:16:06.167 --> 01:16:08.292
Why did you have to tell her that?

01:16:09.792 --> 01:16:11.209
See!

01:16:12.376 --> 01:16:14.626
Why are you all riled up?

01:16:17.042 --> 01:16:18.126
I hate you!

01:16:19.667 --> 01:16:21.584
Make your choice now

01:16:21.584 --> 01:16:23.042
It's me or her

01:16:23.042 --> 01:16:24.126
Answer me

01:16:24.459 --> 01:16:25.584
Answer me!

01:16:32.667 --> 01:16:35.292
I used to wonder when I read the tabloids

01:16:36.459 --> 01:16:37.709
Why girls like Paris Hilton

01:16:37.709 --> 01:16:39.751
Never really have a decent love life?

01:16:43.126 --> 01:16:45.251
They flirt too much

01:16:45.251 --> 01:16:46.584
After a while

01:16:47.709 --> 01:16:49.709
All the sweet talk gets really annoying

01:16:51.709 --> 01:16:52.834
I'm going back to Taipei

01:17:10.917 --> 01:17:12.542
Are you looking for someone?

01:17:16.334 --> 01:17:17.417
Sorry

01:17:30.376 --> 01:17:33.042
Did Angie Zhang switch to another room?

01:17:33.042 --> 01:17:34.167
I'm her friend

01:17:34.459 --> 01:17:36.167
Miss Zhang checked out already

01:17:36.959 --> 01:17:38.001
Thank you

01:17:57.834 --> 01:17:58.834
Michael

01:18:00.792 --> 01:18:02.417
I haven't seen Angie for two days

01:18:02.584 --> 01:18:03.792
Is she on leave?

01:18:03.792 --> 01:18:05.584
You haven't heard?

01:18:05.584 --> 01:18:06.959
She resigned

01:18:07.959 --> 01:18:09.084
Where did she go?

01:18:09.834 --> 01:18:11.334
I was about to ask you the same thing

01:18:11.459 --> 01:18:13.251
Is she working for Qiu now?

01:18:13.251 --> 01:18:15.084
Why did she quit right after the trip?

01:18:17.626 --> 01:18:18.751
I don't know

01:18:19.584 --> 01:18:21.667
Anyway, Angie told me

01:18:21.667 --> 01:18:23.001
To let you lead the team

01:18:25.251 --> 01:18:27.251
Good luck. I'm counting on you

01:19:26.042 --> 01:19:27.167
Marco Gong!

01:19:27.626 --> 01:19:29.376
Marco Gong! Not again!

01:19:30.251 --> 01:19:31.584
You bastard!

01:19:34.251 --> 01:19:35.459
Marco Gong!

01:19:44.417 --> 01:19:46.209
Sorry, Excuse me

01:19:52.709 --> 01:19:53.626
Hey!

01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:55.876
Your bike got stolen again?

01:19:59.376 --> 01:20:00.459
Yes

01:20:01.042 --> 01:20:02.959
Why would he leave me a wheel?

01:20:03.376 --> 01:20:06.251
That's pretty kind of him

01:20:22.626 --> 01:20:24.042
Every time I lost my bike

01:20:24.042 --> 01:20:25.584
Angie would always take me home

01:20:26.334 --> 01:20:27.584
But this time

01:20:28.167 --> 01:20:29.792
I think I've lost her

01:20:54.584 --> 01:20:55.584
Hey

01:20:55.584 --> 01:20:56.417
I thought...

01:20:56.417 --> 01:20:58.626
You were bringing your girlfriend

01:20:58.792 --> 01:20:59.917
We broke up

01:21:01.209 --> 01:21:02.251
What?

01:21:04.251 --> 01:21:05.376
We broke up!

01:21:06.126 --> 01:21:07.209
Already?

01:21:09.459 --> 01:21:10.626
Where's Angie?

01:21:12.292 --> 01:21:13.542
The other day

01:21:14.167 --> 01:21:16.292
She dropped by and gave me a birthday gift

01:21:17.042 --> 01:21:18.376
She said she'd come back

01:21:18.376 --> 01:21:19.542
When was that?

01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:21.626
Two days ago

01:21:25.959 --> 01:21:27.167
What did she give you?

01:21:27.542 --> 01:21:28.542
What did you say?

01:21:28.959 --> 01:21:30.126
What did she give you?

01:21:30.126 --> 01:21:31.167
She gave me this

01:21:49.376 --> 01:21:50.959
You know what, over the years

01:21:52.584 --> 01:21:54.959
I've helped many people unlock their doors

01:21:56.251 --> 01:21:58.334
But there's one door

01:21:58.876 --> 01:22:01.584
That I can't open, no matter how hard I try

01:22:04.042 --> 01:22:05.001
The door to your heart

01:22:09.042 --> 01:22:10.459
Son

01:22:10.459 --> 01:22:13.084
Deep down you know she likes you

01:22:15.667 --> 01:22:17.626
But you never take her seriously

01:22:18.167 --> 01:22:19.209
Angie

01:22:19.417 --> 01:22:22.084
Is like a fool

01:22:23.126 --> 01:22:25.542
- For sticking around
- What did I do wrong?

01:22:26.376 --> 01:22:28.042
I had no idea

01:22:29.792 --> 01:22:31.959
I only found out recently

01:22:33.959 --> 01:22:36.167
You think she's a dude and you joke about it

01:22:36.376 --> 01:22:38.126
But think about it

01:22:39.376 --> 01:22:41.334
That's exactly why

01:22:41.334 --> 01:22:43.084
You like her

01:22:43.876 --> 01:22:45.084
Well...

01:22:45.084 --> 01:22:46.709
I'm not comfortable with her getting flirty

01:22:47.459 --> 01:22:49.501
I like our little fights though

01:22:51.959 --> 01:22:54.209
Your mom passed away too soon

01:22:54.709 --> 01:22:56.626
And I was busy working all the time

01:22:56.917 --> 01:22:59.667
We made you feel insecure

01:23:01.251 --> 01:23:02.834
You were afraid she'd reject your love

01:23:02.834 --> 01:23:05.001
So you shut her out, right?

01:23:05.001 --> 01:23:07.084
She's been hiding from me. What can I do?

01:23:10.334 --> 01:23:12.667
Do you know

01:23:12.667 --> 01:23:15.376
Why kids like playing hide-and-seek?

01:23:21.959 --> 01:23:24.292
Because they want to be found

01:23:39.584 --> 01:23:44.792
"I fear the stillness in the air"

01:23:44.792 --> 01:23:46.626
I'm really grateful

01:23:47.084 --> 01:23:49.667
Thank you for all the help you've given me

01:23:52.417 --> 01:23:54.626
"I fear the memories we share"

01:23:54.626 --> 01:23:58.584
"They haunt me and leave me in despair"

01:23:58.584 --> 01:23:59.917
So you're going to Hangzhou?

01:24:01.167 --> 01:24:02.084
Yes

01:24:03.334 --> 01:24:05.501
I wanna go to grad school

01:24:06.084 --> 01:24:10.126
I gave up too much for that jerk

01:24:12.376 --> 01:24:14.126
I haven't sculpted anything for years

01:24:16.584 --> 01:24:17.542
Okay

01:24:18.042 --> 01:24:19.167
Look at this

01:24:19.584 --> 01:24:20.709
Listen

01:24:20.709 --> 01:24:22.126
This is not a cappuccino

01:24:22.334 --> 01:24:23.917
This is a memory loss potion

01:24:24.209 --> 01:24:25.209
Drink it

01:24:25.209 --> 01:24:26.626
And put the past behind you

01:24:26.626 --> 01:24:28.501
Forget that pighead. Forget that slutty bitch

01:24:30.251 --> 01:24:31.167
Bottoms up

01:24:31.709 --> 01:24:32.751
Bon voyage

01:24:33.959 --> 01:24:37.459
All of a sudden I miss you

01:24:37.459 --> 01:24:40.917
Where are you?

01:24:40.917 --> 01:24:47.542
Are you feeling blue?

01:24:47.751 --> 01:24:51.209
All of a sudden I miss you

01:24:51.209 --> 01:24:54.626
I'm having adÃ©jÃ  vu

01:24:54.626 --> 01:25:01.792
Tears blurring my view

01:25:03.501 --> 01:25:04.667
What are you doing here?

01:25:05.542 --> 01:25:08.584
Listen, I'm kinda an insecure guy

01:25:08.959 --> 01:25:10.834
My mom died when I was a kid

01:25:10.834 --> 01:25:13.209
We were not a wealthy family

01:25:13.209 --> 01:25:16.751
When I meet a girl I like, I get shy

01:25:17.001 --> 01:25:18.834
Then I met you. The timing was perfect

01:25:18.834 --> 01:25:21.834
But I was too scared and stupid to ask you out

01:25:21.834 --> 01:25:23.876
I was selfish. I thought I was protecting you

01:25:23.876 --> 01:25:25.959
- But I was protecting myself
- Forget it

01:25:25.959 --> 01:25:27.001
And uh...

01:25:27.751 --> 01:25:28.792
You know

01:25:35.167 --> 01:25:36.292
I realized

01:25:36.917 --> 01:25:38.209
You're like the tomato

01:25:38.626 --> 01:25:39.876
And I'm the prune

01:25:40.959 --> 01:25:43.626
Although we are in the same basket

01:25:43.959 --> 01:25:45.876
All we are is close

01:25:45.876 --> 01:25:47.084
I never thought we would go well together

01:25:48.626 --> 01:25:51.792
Until I entered you by accident

01:25:52.417 --> 01:25:55.001
And realized we're a perfect match

01:26:05.417 --> 01:26:07.126
It's...

01:26:07.126 --> 01:26:09.167
Just a figure of speech

01:26:10.042 --> 01:26:12.501
Perfect match? Bullshit

01:26:13.501 --> 01:26:15.542
You listened to that woman
and threw everything away

01:26:15.542 --> 01:26:16.542
I didn't!

01:26:26.167 --> 01:26:27.167
You know what?

01:26:27.626 --> 01:26:28.959
I've kept

01:26:29.417 --> 01:26:31.792
Everything you gave me

01:26:32.501 --> 01:26:34.667
Even the flying guillotine

01:26:35.209 --> 01:26:37.501
You told me to throw away

01:26:38.376 --> 01:26:40.376
I kept it but I didn't tell you

01:26:40.584 --> 01:26:42.917
I used it to decorate my phone

01:26:45.751 --> 01:26:47.042
What's the point?

01:26:48.126 --> 01:26:49.292
You're seeing someone now

01:26:52.459 --> 01:26:53.876
I broke up with Hailey

01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:55.834
I told her

01:26:56.459 --> 01:26:57.792
I'm not interested in girls

01:26:58.834 --> 01:27:00.001
I always thought

01:27:01.292 --> 01:27:02.459
I should find myself

01:27:02.459 --> 01:27:04.084
A sweet girlfriend

01:27:04.959 --> 01:27:07.001
But after the trip

01:27:08.042 --> 01:27:09.459
I came to terms with myself

01:27:10.792 --> 01:27:12.709
My desires

01:27:14.709 --> 01:27:15.876
I'm...

01:27:16.501 --> 01:27:17.626
Gay

01:27:18.042 --> 01:27:19.084
You

01:27:19.084 --> 01:27:20.084
Are my true love

01:27:22.459 --> 01:27:23.417
Wait a second

01:27:23.417 --> 01:27:26.459
Why would that turn you into a gay man?

01:27:26.459 --> 01:27:28.126
That's not the point

01:27:28.542 --> 01:27:29.709
The thing is

01:27:30.417 --> 01:27:31.626
I love you

01:27:31.626 --> 01:27:32.626
Angie

01:27:33.126 --> 01:27:35.376
You don't have to change yourself for me

01:27:35.501 --> 01:27:37.834
You're a dude, and that's fine

01:27:39.584 --> 01:27:40.876
I'm the one

01:27:40.876 --> 01:27:42.417
Who has to do a little adjustment

01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:43.709
Now I know...

01:27:45.084 --> 01:27:46.917
What kinda person I am

01:27:47.792 --> 01:27:48.959
And I know

01:27:49.459 --> 01:27:50.792
I need someone like you

01:27:51.459 --> 01:27:52.876
I love you just the way you are

01:28:03.417 --> 01:28:04.459
I'm sorry

01:28:10.876 --> 01:28:11.876
Go get him!

01:28:19.459 --> 01:28:20.584
Hey pighead!

01:28:20.584 --> 01:28:21.501
Yes?

01:28:21.501 --> 01:28:22.501
Where are you going?

01:28:25.792 --> 01:28:27.542
I don't expect you to forgive me

01:28:28.042 --> 01:28:29.667
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life

01:28:30.001 --> 01:28:31.792
Thinking about the mistakes I made

01:28:33.709 --> 01:28:34.876
You wish

01:28:35.709 --> 01:28:37.001
I still have a lot of IOU coupons with me

01:28:37.001 --> 01:28:39.126
I'll use them all. You're not going anywhere

01:28:41.959 --> 01:28:43.792
I know better now

01:28:43.792 --> 01:28:46.209
There's no use sweet talking to you

01:28:47.126 --> 01:28:49.626
I'll let you do all the sweet talking

01:28:51.876 --> 01:28:52.876
So

01:28:53.834 --> 01:28:56.792
Can silly goose forgive pighead?

01:29:06.042 --> 01:29:07.209
Hang on

01:29:08.126 --> 01:29:11.459
What if you run into another girl

01:29:11.792 --> 01:29:13.959
With a nice rack

01:29:14.292 --> 01:29:16.751
And she's really good at flirting?

01:29:17.251 --> 01:29:18.209
What would you do?

01:29:18.209 --> 01:29:20.001
Absolutely nothing

01:29:20.459 --> 01:29:22.376
I told you. I'm gay

01:29:24.792 --> 01:29:26.251
Girls...

01:29:28.417 --> 01:29:30.834
I'm fed up with them

01:29:32.251 --> 01:29:34.917
I just wanna spend time

01:29:35.376 --> 01:29:36.501
With my hot boyfriend

01:29:36.501 --> 01:29:37.542
I hate you

01:29:38.251 --> 01:29:39.334
Let's go!

01:29:39.334 --> 01:29:40.417
I wanna eat some bunnies

01:29:41.001 --> 01:29:42.001
Alright!

01:29:42.001 --> 01:29:43.292
Let's bite their heads off!

01:29:43.292 --> 01:29:44.792
- Let's go!
- Go!

01:29:55.459 --> 01:29:57.126
Talk about passive aggressive

01:29:57.709 --> 01:29:58.917

01:32:39.209 --> 01:32:40.167
What's wrong?

01:32:41.167 --> 01:32:42.626
It's really cold in here

01:32:43.209 --> 01:32:45.292
Can I put my shirt on?

01:32:47.292 --> 01:32:50.417
But we're doing "Ghost"

01:32:50.792 --> 01:32:52.834
You can't treat me like a slave

01:32:52.834 --> 01:32:53.959
One IOU coupon

01:32:53.959 --> 01:32:55.376
And I end up like this

01:32:55.376 --> 01:32:56.709
You still have a lot of coupons left

01:32:56.709 --> 01:32:58.084
God knows what would happen to me!

01:33:00.042 --> 01:33:01.667
Shh...

01:33:02.167 --> 01:33:04.626
Pamper me now

01:33:04.626 --> 01:33:06.334
Then I'll tip you

01:33:06.334 --> 01:33:08.542
