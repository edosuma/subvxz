WEBVTT

00:01.701 --> 00:03.034
Sabrina, what are
you doing home?

00:03.035 --> 00:04.669
I thought your new job
at Pork on a Pole

00:04.670 --> 00:06.037
started this afternoon.

00:06.038 --> 00:07.239
It did. I quit.

00:07.240 --> 00:08.138
Why?

00:08.140 --> 00:09.874
Were the working
conditions unsafe?

00:09.875 --> 00:12.443
No.
Was your boss a total monster?

00:12.444 --> 00:13.945
No.
You got caught with you hand

00:13.946 --> 00:15.780
in the till, didn't you?

00:15.781 --> 00:16.781
No.

00:16.782 --> 00:18.216
Sabrina, no matter
what happened,

00:18.217 --> 00:20.385
no matter how horrible,
we'll understand.

00:23.556 --> 00:24.723
HILDA:
Within reason.

00:24.724 --> 00:26.190
Where's your dignity?

00:26.191 --> 00:29.027
The worst part is,
I had to buy it.

00:30.262 --> 00:32.162
( <i>upbeat rock theme playing</i> )

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074

00:46.279 --> 00:50.048
Tonight, the curious case
of the teenage witch.

00:54.487 --> 00:58.123
Yes, I am the first junior
to get our class ring.

00:58.124 --> 00:59.424
Daddy bought it for me

00:59.425 --> 01:02.160
after I gave him the silent
treatment for a week.

01:02.161 --> 01:04.229
Don't touch.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.398
I think class rings
are so ugly.

01:06.399 --> 01:08.299
I've gotta have one.

01:08.300 --> 01:09.701
Any luck on the job front?

01:09.702 --> 01:11.336
Nothing that doesn't
involve polyester

01:11.337 --> 01:13.238
and public humiliation.
Yeah, same here.

01:13.239 --> 01:14.705
And let me be
the first to tell you,

01:14.706 --> 01:16.141
chicken suits don't breathe.

01:16.142 --> 01:18.776
Oh, if you ladies
are strapped for cash,

01:18.777 --> 01:20.778
I know a place
where you can make top dollar.

01:20.779 --> 01:22.046
Really? Where?
My house.

01:22.047 --> 01:23.982
I'm looking for some
enterprising young person

01:23.983 --> 01:26.517
to scrape the guano
off my bat house

01:26.518 --> 01:30.221
and the entire
75 cents an hour is, uh,

01:30.222 --> 01:31.589
under the table.

01:31.590 --> 01:32.924
( chuckles )

01:34.727 --> 01:36.461
You know the scariest thing
about his offer?

01:36.462 --> 01:38.162
What?
I'm thinking about taking it.

01:39.031 --> 01:40.198
I don't know
what I'll do

01:40.199 --> 01:41.833
if Sabrina
ever finds out.

01:41.834 --> 01:44.069
Man, you're
in a tough spot.

01:44.070 --> 01:46.471
Sabrina, a girlfriend should not
eavesdrop on her boyfriend.

01:46.472 --> 01:48.039
Let me do it.
No, wait.

01:48.040 --> 01:49.140
It's not eavesdropping.

01:49.141 --> 01:50.207
They're talking so loudly

01:50.208 --> 01:51.543
it's impossible
not to overhear.

01:51.544 --> 01:53.077
Now pipe down.

01:53.078 --> 01:54.679
Harvey.
Sabrina.

01:54.680 --> 01:56.815
Uh, we were just listening--
<i>Looking</i> for you.

01:56.816 --> 01:59.316
So, uh, do you wanna go
job-hunting after school today?

01:59.317 --> 02:01.653
No. I mean, I can't.

02:01.654 --> 02:02.654
I already have plans.

02:02.655 --> 02:04.088
I have to...

02:04.089 --> 02:05.390
take care of my plans.

02:05.391 --> 02:07.057
Are we done with
the third degree here?

02:09.895 --> 02:12.464
Don't worry. I'm sure he's
not seeing someone else.

02:12.465 --> 02:15.800
I wasn't even thinking
that <i>until now.</i>

02:17.236 --> 02:19.103
You know, I'm starting
to get a little worried

02:19.104 --> 02:21.505
that Sabrina hasn't solved
the family secret yet.

02:21.506 --> 02:23.174
I can't wait to see
the look on her face

02:23.175 --> 02:24.375
when she gets it.

02:24.376 --> 02:27.212
I wish we could just tell her.
And ruin the surprise?

02:27.213 --> 02:29.314
Sabrina, you're eavesdropping.

02:29.315 --> 02:31.816
It's not eavesdropping.
It's controlled overhearing.

02:31.817 --> 02:33.418
I was gonna say,
you can hear better

02:33.419 --> 02:35.453
through the air vent
in the laundry room.

02:35.454 --> 02:36.821
Do you think my aunts
are gonna get me

02:36.822 --> 02:38.122
my class ring
as a surprise?

02:38.123 --> 02:39.790
BOTH: No.
( squeals )

02:39.791 --> 02:42.426
You know, it's very rude
to eavesdrop on people.

02:42.427 --> 02:45.030
I know. I overheard
someone say that.

02:45.031 --> 02:47.398
When you eavesdrop,
you never get the entire story.

02:49.734 --> 02:53.137
Five hundred red coats
will be landing tomorrow

02:53.138 --> 02:54.105
at Boston Harbor.

02:57.042 --> 02:59.977
Give the signal.
The British attack at dawn.

03:01.079 --> 03:03.782
And at 12 shillings apiece,

03:03.783 --> 03:07.385
these babies should
fly off the shelves.

03:07.386 --> 03:08.987
MAN ( shouting ):
The British are coming.

03:08.988 --> 03:10.055
No, they're not.

03:10.056 --> 03:11.522
MAN:
The British are coming.

03:11.523 --> 03:12.757
No, they're not.

03:12.758 --> 03:14.059
<i>And that's how Hilda</i>

03:14.060 --> 03:15.293
came to start a little thing

03:15.294 --> 03:17.462
we like to call
the American Revolution.

03:17.463 --> 03:18.863
Yeah, well,
it's not like things

03:18.864 --> 03:20.932
have gone bad
for Britain since then.

03:20.933 --> 03:22.800
Hey, things
turned out okay,

03:22.801 --> 03:24.602
for the people who lived.

03:24.603 --> 03:27.639
Look, if you really want enough
money to buy that class ring,

03:27.640 --> 03:29.808
you should call the
Other Realm Employment Agency.

03:29.809 --> 03:32.109
Heh. I remember
this one job they got me once.

03:35.680 --> 03:37.148
Can't you guys
ever tell a story

03:37.149 --> 03:39.217
without the whole
room going fuzzy?

03:39.218 --> 03:40.184
Now,
if you'll excuse me,

03:40.185 --> 03:41.952
I'll go call
and make an appointment.

03:43.221 --> 03:45.189
( siren wailing )

03:45.190 --> 03:46.391
Warning, warning.

03:46.392 --> 03:47.859
Danger, danger.

03:47.860 --> 03:50.395
Don't tell me.
Will Robinson's in trouble?

03:50.396 --> 03:51.695
I've been sent
by the Witches' Council

03:51.696 --> 03:52.998
to give you a warning.

03:52.999 --> 03:55.233
If Sabrina doesn't
solve the family secret soon,

03:55.234 --> 03:57.335
the consequences will be dire.

03:57.336 --> 03:59.004
And, baby, I mean dire.

03:59.005 --> 04:00.438
For Sabrina?

04:00.439 --> 04:01.906
No, for you.

04:01.907 --> 04:03.808
I love that mislead.
Heh-heh.

04:03.809 --> 04:05.343
( siren wailing )

04:05.344 --> 04:06.978
Well, I called
and made an appointment

04:06.979 --> 04:08.746
at the Other Realm
Employment Agency.

04:08.747 --> 04:11.049
No! You are not
leaving this house

04:11.050 --> 04:13.084
until you solve
the family secret.

04:13.085 --> 04:14.485
But--
That's final, young lady.

04:14.486 --> 04:17.288
And you know when I call you
young lady, I mean business.

04:20.325 --> 04:22.527
Okay, from now on,
I'm gonna have to videotape

04:22.528 --> 04:24.795
all my transactions with them.

04:24.796 --> 04:25.930
( siren wailing )
BOTH: Oh.

04:25.931 --> 04:28.599
Warning, warning.
Danger, Danger.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.301
Well, if you'd asked,
we would've told you

04:30.302 --> 04:31.536
that those nuts
were stale.

04:31.537 --> 04:32.537
Why are you here?

04:32.538 --> 04:34.539
Sabrina's hard at work
on the family secret.

04:34.540 --> 04:35.974
But only because
you're forcing her to,

04:35.975 --> 04:37.208
not because she wants to.

04:37.209 --> 04:38.443
How do you know
so much about us?

04:38.444 --> 04:39.577
It's creepy.

04:39.578 --> 04:41.980
Be that as it may,
you have to motivate her

04:41.981 --> 04:44.482
without preventing her
from leading a normal life.

04:44.483 --> 04:45.816
You're breaking the rules.

04:45.817 --> 04:47.919
Oh! I never break rules.

04:47.920 --> 04:50.755
I'm not even comfortable
making a right turn on red.

04:50.756 --> 04:51.889
Well,
you're breaking the rules

04:51.890 --> 04:54.091
for helping your teen
solve the family secret.

04:56.228 --> 04:57.261
They're all right there.

04:57.262 --> 04:58.763
Filmstrips?
We're hoping to get it

04:58.764 --> 05:01.298
on microfiche
by the end of the year.

05:01.299 --> 05:04.035
And don't forget,
the consequences will be--

05:04.036 --> 05:05.070
Dire.
Dire.

05:05.071 --> 05:06.771
But nothing compared
to the consequences

05:06.772 --> 05:08.072
if you don't
return these rewound.

05:09.708 --> 05:10.975
Okay, first you tell me

05:10.976 --> 05:12.444
to get a job to pay
for the class ring.

05:12.445 --> 05:13.778
Second,
I've been trying to solve

05:13.779 --> 05:15.079
that family secret for months.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.414
Third--
We think it's wonderful

05:16.415 --> 05:17.715
that you're getting a job.

05:17.716 --> 05:19.484
HILDA:
And aren't you late
for an interview?

05:19.485 --> 05:21.619
Sometimes the first impression
is the only impression.

05:23.822 --> 05:26.590
Okay, now I've got to get a job,
solve the family secret

05:26.591 --> 05:29.460
and find out
if senility is hereditary.

05:29.461 --> 05:32.430
Okay, honey, let's take
a look at your résumé.

05:32.431 --> 05:33.998
I really hope
you can help me.

05:33.999 --> 05:36.601
Doll, I once got
Pauly Shore his own series.

05:36.602 --> 05:37.635
I can help you.

05:38.336 --> 05:39.737
I can't help you.

05:40.473 --> 05:42.140
Please? I'm desperate.

05:42.141 --> 05:43.274
Don't you have anything?

05:43.275 --> 05:45.376
But you have
no experience, no skills

05:45.377 --> 05:48.713
and Congress isn't
in session right now, so...

05:48.714 --> 05:51.583
Oh, wait, I know,
you could be a sandman.

05:51.584 --> 05:52.784
I could be the sandman?

05:52.785 --> 05:54.419
No, a sandman.

05:54.420 --> 05:56.153
Am I talking too fast
for you, dear?

05:56.789 --> 05:58.322
It's like a paper route.

05:58.323 --> 06:00.791
You put the people in your
neighborhood to sleep at night.

06:00.792 --> 06:04.595
Any idiot can do it,
so you're qualified.

06:04.596 --> 06:05.730
I'll take it.

06:05.731 --> 06:07.899
Wait.
Is there a uniform involved?

06:10.936 --> 06:13.304
Let me guess:
I have to buy it?

06:14.406 --> 06:15.873
MAN ( on TV ):
<i>Nor is it permissible</i>

06:15.874 --> 06:17.975
<i>to strike your teen with</i>
<i>lightning to motivate them.</i>

06:17.976 --> 06:20.945
Oh, finally.
That's the last one.

06:20.946 --> 06:22.680
So I was right.

06:22.681 --> 06:24.014
Yes, you were right.

06:24.015 --> 06:25.283
I knew there wasn't
a rule against

06:25.284 --> 06:27.552
using rabid Packer fans
to motivate your teen.

06:27.553 --> 06:29.487
( all cheering )

06:33.058 --> 06:35.593
But I want a glass of water.

06:35.594 --> 06:38.129
WOMAN:
You've already had
12 glasses of water.

06:38.130 --> 06:39.664
Go to sleep.

06:39.665 --> 06:42.000
But I have to go to the...

06:43.535 --> 06:46.204
Aw, when you're not whining
you're actually kind of cute.

06:47.539 --> 06:48.906
Okay,
I've lost my mind.

06:48.907 --> 06:50.408
Well, this kind of
breaks up the day.

06:51.477 --> 06:52.877
Hey, when I touch him,

06:52.878 --> 06:54.344
I go into his dream.

06:54.345 --> 06:55.880
Cool.

06:58.050 --> 06:59.484
Ew, don't put that
in your mouth.

06:59.485 --> 07:00.384
But it's candy.

07:03.555 --> 07:05.923
Hey, you're right.

07:05.924 --> 07:07.858
It is candy.

07:07.859 --> 07:10.728
It's not very good candy,
but it's your dream.

07:11.730 --> 07:14.298
There.
Give it a try.

07:14.299 --> 07:16.600
DOOR ( squeaking):
<i>Solve the family secret.</i>

07:16.601 --> 07:18.702
<i>Solve the family secret.</i>

07:18.703 --> 07:22.406
Perfect. Now let's work
on that fresco over her bed.

07:22.407 --> 07:23.708
Well, she was hard
to get to sleep.

07:23.709 --> 07:25.143
I had to use
so much sand on her,

07:25.144 --> 07:26.744
she could be used
as a bank ashtray.

07:26.745 --> 07:28.045
( mumbling )

07:28.046 --> 07:29.446
Wonder what she's dreaming.

07:29.447 --> 07:30.548
( gibberish )

07:30.549 --> 07:31.715
What was that?

07:31.716 --> 07:33.651
"Come into my dream, Sabrina."

07:33.652 --> 07:34.818
If you insist.

07:39.291 --> 07:40.859
A test?

07:40.860 --> 07:42.393
I, uh--
I haven't studied.

07:42.394 --> 07:44.295
I haven't even
opened the book.

07:44.296 --> 07:46.230
My whole grade
depends on this.

07:46.231 --> 07:49.600
The rest of my life
depends on passing this class.

07:50.703 --> 07:51.869
( screaming )

07:51.870 --> 07:53.370
Where are my clothes?

07:53.371 --> 07:55.940
Twenty-three thousand
four hundred and fifty-one,

07:55.941 --> 07:58.309
23,452...

07:58.310 --> 07:59.277
( gasping )

07:59.278 --> 08:02.079
The Jolly Green Giant
is a cruel taskmaster.

08:02.080 --> 08:05.316
Mr. Kraft is
a deeply tormented man.

08:05.317 --> 08:06.517
Cool.

08:06.518 --> 08:08.653
It's such a gasser

08:08.654 --> 08:11.522
to be named a member
of the Rat Pack, baby.

08:11.523 --> 08:14.825
Now that it's official,
how do we ditch Lawford?

08:16.462 --> 08:19.497
Freak. Loser.
Loser-freak.

08:19.498 --> 08:21.165
Geek cluster.

08:22.634 --> 08:24.702
I told you
to stay home today.

08:27.239 --> 08:29.807
This is just
a normal day at school.

08:29.808 --> 08:30.808
Oh, I get it.

08:30.809 --> 08:32.109
Every day in high school

08:32.110 --> 08:34.111
is a dream come true
for Libby.

08:35.114 --> 08:36.581
There's a spill.

08:41.686 --> 08:43.788
Yep, that happened today.

08:46.024 --> 08:47.058
Oh, ah.

08:47.059 --> 08:49.894
George,
watch the splinters.

08:49.895 --> 08:51.261
Hey.

08:51.262 --> 08:52.797
Get out of my dream.

08:55.834 --> 08:58.068
Sabrina, I can't believe
you dream-dropped.

08:58.069 --> 08:59.837
I can't believe
there's a word for it.

08:59.838 --> 09:01.472
Dreams reveal
a person's innermost

09:01.473 --> 09:03.508
thoughts, feelings
and desires.

09:03.509 --> 09:05.543
George Washington? Heh, heh.

09:05.544 --> 09:07.211
And your presence in them

09:07.212 --> 09:10.514
could influence the course
of events in that person's life.

09:10.515 --> 09:13.284
I'm sorry. I'll never drop
into one of your dreams again.

09:13.285 --> 09:15.486
But I think I'm the one
who suffered the most.

09:15.487 --> 09:18.389
Even though you're in big,
big, trouble, young lady,

09:18.390 --> 09:20.524
there's no reason you can't
have some hot cocoa.

09:23.328 --> 09:25.630
Does this have anything to do
with the two dozen cheeseheads

09:25.631 --> 09:27.131
passed out in the living room?

09:28.333 --> 09:29.700
Valerie, listen.

09:29.701 --> 09:31.368
I know you tend to worry
a lot with school,

09:31.369 --> 09:33.170
but you're really smart,
so I guess what

09:33.171 --> 09:35.606
I'm trying to say is,
don't be such a worrywart.

09:35.607 --> 09:37.241
As strange a greeting
as that was,

09:37.242 --> 09:39.243
I suddenly feel
incredibly relieved.

09:39.244 --> 09:40.311
Thanks, Sabrina.

09:40.312 --> 09:41.980
And my aunts said
nothing good would come

09:41.981 --> 09:43.313
of dropping in
on people's dreams.

09:43.314 --> 09:44.849
Mr. Kraft.
Not now, Spellman.

09:44.850 --> 09:46.884
There is a situation
in the teachers' lounge.

09:46.885 --> 09:48.586
The school nurse
fell asleep smoking

09:48.587 --> 09:50.420
and set fire to
the couch again.

09:50.421 --> 09:51.889
Oh, wait. I just wanted
to ask you, um,

09:51.890 --> 09:53.558
what would you call
the color of your tie?

09:53.559 --> 09:54.625
Pea green?

09:55.961 --> 09:58.529
No, absolutely not.
It's-- It's kelly green.

09:58.530 --> 09:59.931
Well, I guess I'll
see you at lunch today.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.799
I hear the soup is,
uh, split pea.

10:02.934 --> 10:05.069
I think I need some air.

10:05.070 --> 10:07.271
Ah, peas.

10:07.272 --> 10:10.707
Okay, that's the last time
I ever use dream-dropping

10:10.708 --> 10:13.110
for my personal amusement again.

10:13.111 --> 10:15.612
Geek. Loser.

10:15.613 --> 10:18.116
Freak.
Libby, congratulations.

10:18.117 --> 10:20.717
You know, I-- I hear you have
enough credits to graduate now.

10:20.718 --> 10:22.419
No more high school.
Whoo-hoo.

10:22.420 --> 10:24.922
What?
That can't be true.

10:24.923 --> 10:26.590
I have to talk to Mr. Kraft.

10:26.591 --> 10:29.360
Oh, I think he's in
the teachers' lounge.

10:29.361 --> 10:31.962
Okay, there.
Out of my system.

10:31.963 --> 10:33.464
Harvey?
Oh, hey, Sabrina.

10:33.465 --> 10:34.632
Didn't see you there.

10:34.633 --> 10:36.934
Is everything okay?
I called you yesterday--

10:36.935 --> 10:38.969
Yeah, well,
I had to do this thing,

10:38.970 --> 10:41.405
at the place,
with some people.

10:41.406 --> 10:43.073
I'll call you later.

10:43.074 --> 10:45.576
Okay, he's acting weird.

10:45.577 --> 10:47.244
I wonder if a sandman
could find out why.

10:48.880 --> 10:51.448
Whoa. What's this?

10:51.449 --> 10:53.517
Smells like espresso.

10:53.518 --> 10:54.719
( gulping )

11:00.125 --> 11:01.725
You won't tell me
what's bothering you,

11:01.726 --> 11:03.294
but maybe your
subconscious will.

11:03.295 --> 11:05.095
( Salem sneezes )

11:05.096 --> 11:07.231
Salem, what are you
doing in my bag?

11:07.232 --> 11:08.799
And it better not be
what I saw you doing

11:08.800 --> 11:10.167
in the Flanagans' sandbox.

11:10.168 --> 11:12.303
No, your aunts asked me
to tag along

11:12.304 --> 11:14.104
to make sure you don't,
uh--

11:14.105 --> 11:15.573
What was it again?

11:15.574 --> 11:17.875
I'm supposed to
stop you from--

11:17.876 --> 11:19.477
Wait,
it'll come to me.

11:19.478 --> 11:20.611
Nope.

11:20.612 --> 11:21.611
Never tell me anything

11:21.612 --> 11:23.680
when I'm watching <i>V.I.P.</i>

11:23.681 --> 11:25.949
Since you're here, you wanna
pop into Harvey's dream with me?

11:25.950 --> 11:28.119
Sure. Maybe I'll think
of it while we're there.

11:31.790 --> 11:33.323
This is his dream?

11:33.324 --> 11:35.693
I was a teenage boy once,
and let me tell you,

11:35.694 --> 11:37.561
he's wastin' a dream.

11:37.562 --> 11:39.096
Hey, that's our French book.

11:39.097 --> 11:40.865
I get it.

11:40.866 --> 11:42.165
We have a huge
French test tomorrow,

11:42.166 --> 11:44.101
and Harvey's probably
afraid he's gonna fail.

11:44.102 --> 11:45.736
That's why he's been
acting so weird lately.

11:45.737 --> 11:46.871
It has nothing to do with me.

11:46.872 --> 11:49.607
And denial
is a river in Egypt.

11:49.608 --> 11:50.607
( laughs )

11:50.608 --> 11:52.109
I just made that one up.

11:57.649 --> 11:59.517
<i>Mon petit livre.</i>

11:59.518 --> 12:02.286
<i>Je suis très, très heureuse.</i>

12:02.287 --> 12:05.055
I think that means he's happy
he has his book back,

12:05.056 --> 12:07.791
or he lost his Slinky.

12:07.792 --> 12:09.460
Maybe I should study.

12:10.895 --> 12:13.464
See? Look how peacefully
he's sleeping now.

12:13.465 --> 12:15.999
And wouldn't let that
thumb-sucking thing bother you.

12:17.402 --> 12:18.635
HARVEY:
Hey, Sabrina.

12:18.636 --> 12:20.872
Guess what?
I think I aced my French test.

12:20.873 --> 12:22.907
I knew that
was bothering you.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.174
I mean,
congratulations.

12:24.175 --> 12:26.276
So now that you have the stress
of that test behind you,

12:26.277 --> 12:27.711
do you wanna go
out after school--?

12:27.712 --> 12:28.846
Sabrina, no.

12:28.847 --> 12:30.882
I can't go out with you
after school.

12:30.883 --> 12:32.750
You gotta stop
asking me that.

12:32.751 --> 12:35.786
( <i>gloomy theme playing</i> )

12:35.787 --> 12:37.521
I-I don't think he's
seeing anyone else.

12:37.522 --> 12:39.690
Me neither.

12:39.691 --> 12:42.026
So who do you think it is?

12:45.230 --> 12:47.564
So the reason Harvey's been
acting so weird toward me lately

12:47.565 --> 12:49.833
has absolutely nothing
to do with his French test.

12:49.834 --> 12:51.669
Dreams have
to be interpreted.

12:51.670 --> 12:52.937
They're symbolic.

12:52.938 --> 12:55.172
Like when I'm dreaming
of a thousand-pound tuna,

12:55.173 --> 12:57.574
I'm really dreaming
about salmon.

12:57.575 --> 12:59.376
But I don't know
how to interpret dreams.

12:59.377 --> 13:03.047
You don't, but my old buddy
Sigmund Freud does.

13:03.048 --> 13:05.649
Salem, for once
you might be onto something.

13:05.650 --> 13:07.451
( <i>regal theme playing</i> )

13:09.154 --> 13:10.721
( Austrian accent ):
Where am I?

13:10.722 --> 13:14.158
I was just grabbing a quick bite
between patients, und--

13:14.159 --> 13:15.860
Hello, Sigmund.

13:15.861 --> 13:16.793
I know that voice.

13:18.230 --> 13:20.464
Saberhagen?

13:20.465 --> 13:21.699
How's my wife?

13:21.700 --> 13:24.801
Oh, that's right.
We weren't really friends.

13:24.802 --> 13:26.570
( knock at door )
ZELDA: Sabrina?

13:26.571 --> 13:28.238
The cops.
Get rid of him.

13:28.239 --> 13:30.507
Uh, why don't you hide in here
for just a few minutes?

13:30.508 --> 13:32.742
And, um, try not to
get mustard on anything.

13:32.743 --> 13:33.844
Okay.

13:33.845 --> 13:35.245
Yes?

13:35.246 --> 13:37.014
DOOR:
<i>Solve the family secret.</i>

13:37.015 --> 13:38.748
<i>Solve the family secret.</i>
What are you doing?

13:38.749 --> 13:41.418
What do you think we're doing?

13:41.419 --> 13:42.820
I'm just sitting here

13:42.821 --> 13:45.255
trying to solve
the family secret.

13:45.256 --> 13:47.791
And I'm just batting
at dust particles

13:47.792 --> 13:49.360
because I think
they're real.

13:49.361 --> 13:50.828
Uh-huh.

13:50.829 --> 13:52.096
Well, this should help.

13:52.097 --> 13:53.831
I managed to track down
your cousin Stanislav.

13:53.832 --> 13:55.399
He sent you another clue.

13:55.400 --> 13:56.934
Oh. Great.
Well, I'd better get back

13:56.935 --> 13:57.968
to solving this thing.

13:57.969 --> 13:59.136
Thanks for the clue,

13:59.137 --> 14:00.438
and, uh,
we'll see you later.

14:00.439 --> 14:02.640
DOOR: <i>Solve the family secret.</i>
Okay. Bye-bye.

14:02.641 --> 14:05.109
All right, let's get the shrink
and go to Harvey's.

14:05.110 --> 14:06.510
Well, is she working on it?

14:06.511 --> 14:07.644
Probably not.

14:07.645 --> 14:09.580
She has Freud
hiding in the closet.

14:09.581 --> 14:10.815
Freud? Oh!

14:10.816 --> 14:13.150
That man will do
anything to see me again.

14:13.151 --> 14:15.152
You know, he might
have a brilliant mind,

14:15.153 --> 14:16.954
but with me
he's all hands.

14:16.955 --> 14:19.056
See? Something's
obviously bothering him.

14:19.057 --> 14:20.758
It couldn't be
the crowd of people

14:20.759 --> 14:22.192
standing around him
every night.

14:22.193 --> 14:23.493
Shh.
He's clearly

14:23.494 --> 14:25.696
having a very
disturbing dream.

14:25.697 --> 14:28.065
Though not as disturbing
as the one I am having.

14:28.066 --> 14:29.367
Yeah, yeah.
Tell it to Jung.

14:30.635 --> 14:32.536
( dance music playing )

14:39.578 --> 14:41.111
I think you
accidentally zapped us

14:41.112 --> 14:43.014
into a
Calvin Klein commercial.

14:43.015 --> 14:44.181
Hey, there's Harvey.

14:44.182 --> 14:48.352
Ah, but this is
so easy to interpret.

14:48.353 --> 14:51.455
That that is Harvey's
emotional baggage

14:51.456 --> 14:52.923
which he is
struggling with.

14:52.924 --> 14:54.458
Ah, and that--

14:54.459 --> 14:56.259
That is his inner child.

14:56.260 --> 14:57.494
( crying )

14:57.495 --> 14:59.496
He is usually
at the table next to me

14:59.497 --> 15:02.299
in fine restaurants.

15:02.300 --> 15:03.633
What's that?

15:03.634 --> 15:06.070
That's a giant
floating banana.

15:06.071 --> 15:10.207
Clearly, Harvey's problem
is that he is overwhelmed

15:10.208 --> 15:12.176
by all the pressure
in his life.

15:12.177 --> 15:14.912
Nothing that a lifetime
of therapy won't take care of.

15:14.913 --> 15:17.013
I don't have a lifetime.

15:17.014 --> 15:18.782
( <i>heavenly theme playing</i> )

15:23.789 --> 15:25.489
How come he got a cone
and I didn't?

15:27.358 --> 15:29.059
See? It worked.

15:29.060 --> 15:30.160
Sleeping like a baby.

15:30.161 --> 15:32.196
Though I might be
a little concerned

15:32.197 --> 15:33.998
with that thumb-sucking.

15:37.735 --> 15:39.303
What happened to Freud?

15:39.304 --> 15:40.504
Uh...

15:40.505 --> 15:42.806
Why do we still have
daylight savings?

15:42.807 --> 15:43.941
Your turn.

15:43.942 --> 15:46.643
Fine. My category
is dream-dropping.

15:46.644 --> 15:48.478
Oh, sorry. It wasn't
in the form of a question.

15:48.479 --> 15:50.014
You're disqualified.
Night.

15:50.015 --> 15:52.383
Sabrina.
Okay.

15:52.384 --> 15:54.685
I know, I'm not supposed
to do it anymore,

15:54.686 --> 15:56.587
but I was just trying
to help Harvey out

15:56.588 --> 15:58.221
and I'm sure
I didn't hurt anyone.

15:58.222 --> 16:00.390
You obviously know better,
Sabrina.

16:00.391 --> 16:02.426
So you'll just have to live
with the consequences.

16:02.427 --> 16:04.295
Fine. Now, if you'll excuse me,
it's a school night.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.533
Wait a minute.

16:09.534 --> 16:10.868
What conse...?

16:10.869 --> 16:12.136
( snoring )

16:12.137 --> 16:15.872
Sounds just like you
before the surgery.

16:15.873 --> 16:18.041
Hey, Valerie, how'd you do
on the math homework last night?

16:18.042 --> 16:20.076
I-- I spent two hours
on it this morning.

16:20.077 --> 16:21.578
I didn't do it.

16:21.579 --> 16:22.980
Why not?

16:22.981 --> 16:24.281
Don't know.
Don't really care.

16:24.282 --> 16:25.882
You should take
your own advice, Sabrina,

16:25.883 --> 16:27.117
and stop being
such a worrywart.

16:27.118 --> 16:29.052
Wait, wait. I used
the term "worrywart"

16:29.053 --> 16:30.520
and you actually
listened to me?

16:30.521 --> 16:31.888
What's going on?

16:31.889 --> 16:33.490
They're committing
Mr. Kraft.

16:33.491 --> 16:35.659
The drama club wanted to
put on <i>The Princess and the Pea</i>

16:35.660 --> 16:36.960
and he totally lost it.

16:36.961 --> 16:38.629
So many peas.
Who's gonna count 'em all?

16:38.630 --> 16:40.497
There are too many.
There are just too many peas.

16:40.498 --> 16:42.199
Wait. These can't be
the consequences

16:42.200 --> 16:43.500
my aunts talked about.

16:43.501 --> 16:45.569
This is a coincidence.
The man was a time bomb.

16:45.570 --> 16:46.970
Hey, Sabrina.

16:46.971 --> 16:48.538
Harvey,
you're talking to me?

16:48.539 --> 16:50.941
Yeah, well, I've been
a little preoccupied lately.

16:50.942 --> 16:53.843
But last night I had this dream,
and when I woke up this morning

16:53.844 --> 16:55.879
everything was
as clear as day.

16:55.880 --> 16:57.547
Partially because it was day.

16:57.548 --> 16:59.249
I knew you'd
work it all out.

17:00.018 --> 17:01.351
Sabrina,

17:01.352 --> 17:02.686
we've been goin' out
for a long time

17:02.687 --> 17:05.122
and I feel like there's
something I need to say to you.

17:05.123 --> 17:06.990
Oh, you know you
can tell me anything.

17:06.991 --> 17:08.492
I wanna break up with you.

17:08.492 --> 17:09.660
What?!

17:09.661 --> 17:11.395
I knew you were gonna
make a scene.

17:11.396 --> 17:12.563
( stammering )

17:12.564 --> 17:15.398
I'm not making a scene.
This is not a scene.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.901
What, haven't you ever seen
anyone make a scene before?

17:19.838 --> 17:21.405
So now, for no reason,

17:21.406 --> 17:23.674
my boyfriend wants
to break up with me.

17:23.675 --> 17:25.076
Okay, I admit it.

17:25.077 --> 17:26.810
You were right.
I was wrong.

17:26.810 --> 17:28.377
You smart. Me dumb.

17:28.378 --> 17:30.581
Now, please, please,
please, help me fix it.

17:30.582 --> 17:33.150
I'm sorry, honey,
but there's nothing we can do.

17:33.151 --> 17:34.752
You manipulated
his subconscious.

17:34.753 --> 17:36.854
We warned you
this could happen.

17:36.855 --> 17:39.323
Really? 'Cause I don't
remember you warning me.

17:39.324 --> 17:40.757
( both groan )
( siren wailing )

17:40.758 --> 17:42.793
Warning, warning.
Danger, danger.

17:42.794 --> 17:44.662
See, now, maybe if you'd
worn something like that,

17:44.663 --> 17:46.830
I would have paid attention.

17:46.831 --> 17:49.300
Your time to solve
the family secret has expired.

17:49.301 --> 17:51.935
What? Why didn't you tell me
to work on the family secret?

17:51.936 --> 17:54.237
( both groan )

17:54.238 --> 17:56.373
Okay, uh, well,
just give me two seconds

17:56.374 --> 17:58.242
and I'll--
I'll figure it out right now.

17:58.243 --> 18:00.511
Okay, I just got
another clue yesterday.

18:00.512 --> 18:01.678
Here it is.

18:01.679 --> 18:04.214
It's a picture of...me?

18:04.215 --> 18:05.416
In a very cheap frame.

18:08.052 --> 18:09.553
Okay, let's see, um...

18:09.554 --> 18:12.623
Every member
of the Spellmans...

18:12.624 --> 18:14.124
Yes.
Yes.

18:15.526 --> 18:17.194
BOTH:
Yes.

18:17.195 --> 18:19.196
...are related to me.

18:19.197 --> 18:20.798
Wrong.

18:20.799 --> 18:22.265
Oh, who is this guy?

18:22.266 --> 18:23.934
And now for
the consequences.

18:23.935 --> 18:26.136
I know, I know.
I don't get my witch's license.

18:26.137 --> 18:27.837
No, honey,
it's worse than that.

18:27.838 --> 18:29.506
You're now
no longer a witch.

18:29.507 --> 18:33.377
Wha--? I lost my boyfriend
and my magic all in one day?

18:33.378 --> 18:35.412
Don't forget your home.
WOMEN: What?!

18:35.413 --> 18:37.881
I said the consequences
were gonna be dire.

18:37.882 --> 18:38.882
It's the suit,
isn't it?

18:38.883 --> 18:41.118
That's why no one
takes me seriously.

18:41.119 --> 18:43.019
Sabrina can stay here
as long as she likes.

18:43.020 --> 18:44.922
We love her whether
she has magic or not.

18:44.923 --> 18:46.790
You can't have a mortal
living under your roof.

18:46.791 --> 18:47.924
But don't worry.

18:47.925 --> 18:49.059
It's not like we're just gonna

18:49.060 --> 18:50.794
turn her out into the cold.

18:50.795 --> 18:52.696
A $20 bill?
Go easy.

18:52.697 --> 18:54.732
It has to last you
the rest of your life.

18:54.733 --> 18:56.399
Aunt Hilda. Aunt Zelda.

18:58.036 --> 18:59.069
( screams )

18:59.070 --> 19:00.036
Aunt Hilda?

19:00.037 --> 19:01.671
Aunt Zelda?

19:01.672 --> 19:04.374
Wait a minute. Um, I'm lost
and I really need to get home.

19:04.375 --> 19:05.575
Can you help me?

19:05.576 --> 19:06.509
Oh, sure.

19:06.510 --> 19:07.878
Do you have any money?

19:07.879 --> 19:09.746
Yeah. I have $20.

19:09.747 --> 19:11.414
Not anymore.
Wait. Stop!

19:11.415 --> 19:13.917
( buzzing )

19:16.587 --> 19:18.255
Hey, blondie.

19:18.256 --> 19:20.490
This is my place.
If you wanna stretch out,

19:20.491 --> 19:21.892
use the grate by the wall.

19:21.893 --> 19:23.460
It used to be Stinky's,
but he's dead.

19:25.730 --> 19:29.533
I lost my magic, my boyfriend,
my home, my family.

19:29.534 --> 19:32.036
All I have is a Chiclet
and Stinky's grate.

19:32.037 --> 19:33.237
MAN:
Hey.

19:33.238 --> 19:35.873
Stinky left me this grate
in his will.

19:35.874 --> 19:38.041
I'll sell it to you
for a Chiclet.

19:38.042 --> 19:39.710
Sorry. I didn't know.

19:40.579 --> 19:42.045
Ow.

19:42.046 --> 19:45.048
A giant floating banana?

19:45.049 --> 19:47.751
Wait a minute. I'm...

19:47.752 --> 19:49.152
dreaming.

19:49.153 --> 19:50.454
Tell me it was all a dream.

19:50.455 --> 19:51.955
It was all a dream.

19:51.956 --> 19:55.125
Harvey didn't break up with you
and you still have your magic.

19:55.126 --> 19:56.126
HILDA:
And your home.

19:56.127 --> 19:57.594
We did it to show you
how destructive

19:57.595 --> 19:58.962
dream-dropping
can really be.

19:58.963 --> 20:01.799
And to try to motivate you
to solve the family secret.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.167
Who did you guys punish
before I moved in?

20:04.168 --> 20:05.969
I should have known
it was all a dream

20:05.970 --> 20:07.971
when that annoying
cone guy appeared.

20:07.972 --> 20:08.839
( laughs )

20:08.840 --> 20:10.040
Warning, warning.

20:10.041 --> 20:11.508
Danger, danger.

20:11.509 --> 20:13.610
Unfortunately,
he's real.

20:13.611 --> 20:14.711
Don't worry, Sabrina.

20:14.712 --> 20:16.947
We're not gonna let him
take you away.

20:16.948 --> 20:20.083
What's this?
A strongly worded citation.

20:20.084 --> 20:21.484
"You have 30 days
to help Sabrina

20:21.485 --> 20:23.587
"solve
the family secret, or...

20:23.588 --> 20:25.322
there will be a $25 fine."

20:25.323 --> 20:27.191
This is your
idea of dire?

20:27.192 --> 20:29.059
Okay, maybe "dire"
was a little bit strong,

20:29.060 --> 20:31.795
but, hey, it really lit
a fire under you gals.

20:36.367 --> 20:38.635
You'll learn.
They're big on punishment.

20:38.636 --> 20:40.770
I had to pay for that uniform.

20:43.741 --> 20:45.976
Hey.
Hey. Mystery's been solved.

20:45.977 --> 20:48.379
I found out what Harvey's been
doing every day after school.

20:48.380 --> 20:50.681
And I really think
he owes you an explanation.

20:50.682 --> 20:52.515
Oh, no,
it is another girl.

20:52.516 --> 20:53.850
Brace yourself.

20:58.122 --> 20:59.355
Pork on a pole?

20:59.356 --> 21:00.691
( <i>upbeat rock theme playing</i> )

21:03.795 --> 21:05.462
There's no way I'm ever
gonna look cute in this,

21:05.463 --> 21:07.631
is there?
Uh, no.

21:07.632 --> 21:10.166
You would have thought the
nightmare was punishment enough.

21:10.167 --> 21:11.601
My aunts aren't
making me do this.

21:11.602 --> 21:13.436
I decided that a class ring
is more important

21:13.437 --> 21:14.637
than my self-respect.

21:14.638 --> 21:16.640
And I got the same
shift as Harvey.

21:16.641 --> 21:19.109
I still think you should have
kept your sandman job.

21:19.110 --> 21:20.210
Well,
it was kind of hard

21:20.211 --> 21:22.345
once I heard the words
"you're fired."

21:22.346 --> 21:24.280
I guess they weren't big
on dream-dropping either.

21:24.281 --> 21:25.849
I hope I can stay awake
long enough

21:25.850 --> 21:28.085
to see who
the new sandman is.

21:28.086 --> 21:29.853
Yeah. I wonder who took over.

21:29.854 --> 21:32.122
Let the nightmare begin.

21:32.123 --> 21:33.356
( gasps )

21:33.357 --> 21:34.758
Don't--
Don't hurt me, sprout.

21:34.759 --> 21:36.025
I'll count faster.
