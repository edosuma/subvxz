00:06.000 --> 00:07.160
Smoking is bad for you.

00:07.280 --> 00:09.000
Oy, Goldilocks.

00:09.120 --> 00:09.880
Party is over.

00:10.000 --> 00:10.800
Who the fuck are--

00:10.920 --> 00:11.680
[hiss]

00:11.800 --> 00:13.040
Oh, Jesus!

00:13.160 --> 00:14.280
Are you him?

00:14.400 --> 00:15.400
Yeah, I'm him.

00:15.520 --> 00:17.440
My daughters are good girls.

00:17.560 --> 00:21.640
WOMAN: She's a cow who'sdaughter has invaded my home.

00:21.760 --> 00:23.320
WOLF: You know, I've
heard about you.

00:23.440 --> 00:24.720
You're trouble, apparently.

00:24.840 --> 00:27.720
Your family, they're
nothing but trouble.

00:27.840 --> 00:29.400
Guess that explains it.

00:29.520 --> 00:30.840
Explains what?

00:30.960 --> 00:32.880
What we have going on.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.400
Which is?

00:34.520 --> 00:37.720
Along the lines of this.

00:37.840 --> 00:40.200
You reckon, do you?

00:40.320 --> 00:43.080
No, no.

00:43.200 --> 00:45.200
WOLF: Mom, there's somebodyI would like you to meet.

00:45.320 --> 00:46.240
Hello Wolf's mom.

00:46.360 --> 00:47.720
Rita.

00:47.840 --> 00:48.600
Hi, I'm Cheryl.

00:51.680 --> 00:53.720
She thinks she owns the place.

00:53.840 --> 00:55.120
No consideration for us.

00:58.080 --> 00:59.880
Morning, Rita.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.280
Get out.

01:01.400 --> 01:03.200
Ted, put a lock on the door.

01:03.320 --> 01:04.200
You are a bloody locksmith.

01:04.320 --> 01:05.880
Yeah, I'll get around to that.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.280
It's bloody rude.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.640
Mom!

01:08.760 --> 01:09.760
Morning, Rita.

01:09.880 --> 01:10.760
Come on, Rita.

01:10.880 --> 01:11.920
She's hardly the Anti-Christ.

01:12.040 --> 01:13.680
You would say
that, wouldn't you?

01:13.800 --> 01:15.360
Once, OK, one time.

01:21.960 --> 01:23.400
Wandering around
our house wearing

01:23.520 --> 01:28.040
next to nothing like thelittle slutty pants she is.

01:28.160 --> 01:29.760
You know, I remember
there was a time

01:29.880 --> 01:31.360
when you and I were young--

01:31.480 --> 01:33.400
Oh, Ted, I'm not walkingaround the house in my undies

01:33.520 --> 01:34.960
for you.

01:35.080 --> 01:36.680
--when we were young andin love, didn't give a shit

01:36.800 --> 01:38.200
about what people thought.

01:38.320 --> 01:39.960
He can do a lot
better than her.

01:40.080 --> 01:40.840
That's all I'm saying.

01:40.960 --> 01:42.960
Yeah, I got that.

01:43.080 --> 01:45.320
But at the end of the day,that's up to him, not you,

01:45.440 --> 01:47.040
isn't it?

01:47.160 --> 01:47.960
Rita.

01:51.280 --> 01:53.520
Over my dead body is
she the one for him.

01:53.640 --> 01:55.640
OK, let me put it another way.

01:55.760 --> 01:57.840
We just got our boy back.

01:57.960 --> 01:59.960
Do you really want to riskdriving him away again by going

02:00.080 --> 02:01.760
to war with his girlfriend.

02:05.640 --> 02:07.760
I'm still calling
her slutty pants.

02:07.880 --> 02:11.520
[music playing]

02:11.640 --> 02:13.600
Hey, Falani, what kind ofclub did you say this is?

02:13.720 --> 02:14.880
A club for dancing, my friend.

02:17.880 --> 02:19.240
[music playing]

02:19.360 --> 02:22.720
[SINGING] If you want totouch me, get with my body

02:22.840 --> 02:27.200
tonight, tonight.

02:27.320 --> 02:31.680
If you want to knoe me,get with my body tonight.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.360
If you want to touch me--

02:36.480 --> 02:37.880
What?

02:38.000 --> 02:39.360
You already spend so muchtime with those fag hags.

02:39.480 --> 02:42.040
Be worse if if I cruisingthe room all night?

02:42.160 --> 02:43.920
I'm starting to wonder ifyou're actually straight.

02:44.040 --> 02:48.080
Steve, are you prejudicedagainst straight people?

02:48.200 --> 02:49.880
Coming through
dolls, make way.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.640
Yeah, Falani, I
don't think this

02:51.760 --> 02:53.280
is the kind of club
you think it is.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.480
If you think I think it isa superb time of much dancing,

02:55.600 --> 02:57.840
then I can assure you,it is what I think it is.

02:57.960 --> 02:58.720
Excuse me.

03:01.680 --> 03:05.000
She's the most beautiful womanI've seen in my whole life.

03:05.120 --> 03:07.960
What would you do
a woman like that?

03:08.080 --> 03:09.080
Well, what would
I do with her?

03:12.560 --> 03:14.560
What would you do with her?

03:14.680 --> 03:17.280
I'd take her for a
walk somewhere nice,

03:17.400 --> 03:19.480
maybe the beach
or Queen Street--

03:19.600 --> 03:20.840
Oh, yeah.

03:20.960 --> 03:23.360
--buy her an ice cream
or maybe some chow mein,

03:23.480 --> 03:24.760
depending on the weather.

03:24.880 --> 03:26.040
And then, you know, I'd--

03:26.160 --> 03:27.720
I'd just give her one.

03:31.160 --> 03:33.920
Oh, yeah, I don't think.

03:34.040 --> 03:35.280
We have appropriate ID, sir.

03:35.400 --> 03:37.120
Hey, you I don't have
a problem with, brother.

03:37.240 --> 03:38.360
These two, however.

03:38.480 --> 03:39.240
Excuse me.

03:39.360 --> 03:40.160
Sorry.

03:40.280 --> 03:41.960
Hi.

03:42.080 --> 03:43.960
I want to be a
part of your life.

03:44.080 --> 03:44.840
You are.

03:44.960 --> 03:46.480
All of it.

03:46.600 --> 03:49.000
It's not like I can turn upat Ted's with you in tow, is it?

03:49.120 --> 03:51.120
Let the dancing commence.

03:51.240 --> 03:53.200
What did you say to him?

03:53.320 --> 03:55.040
Told him it's
their first date,

03:55.160 --> 03:56.320
that Eric only just came out.

03:59.920 --> 04:02.640
Look, I'm sorry thatthings are the way they are.

04:02.760 --> 04:04.840
But the truth is that,well, anyone who's around us

04:04.960 --> 04:06.880
for any length of time
will see how I feel

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
about you because I love you.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.000
And I promise thingswon't always be like this.

04:24.640 --> 04:25.440
Bilkey.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.440
Boys.

04:30.560 --> 04:31.560
Have a good night, eh?

04:31.680 --> 04:32.480
Excuse me.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.280
What?

04:36.400 --> 04:37.560
You've never seen
gay people before?

04:37.680 --> 04:39.600
But he's one of
my dad's mates.

04:42.360 --> 04:44.160
If Ted and his mates can'taccept you for who you are,

04:44.280 --> 04:45.440
then screw them.

04:45.560 --> 04:46.760
This isn't fucking
high school, Steve.

04:46.880 --> 04:48.840
And it's not just my
mates I'm worried about.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.320
This is my job, my fucking life.

04:50.440 --> 04:51.920
Yeah, yeah, the one
I'm not a part of.

04:52.040 --> 04:53.360
Don't.

04:53.480 --> 04:55.520
Don't you fucking darepretend it's that simple.

04:59.120 --> 05:03.960
[laughter]

05:04.080 --> 05:05.240
Morning Mr. Ted, Mr. Lefty.

05:05.360 --> 05:06.720
Falani.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.120
Big night, was it?

05:08.240 --> 05:10.120
Oh yeah.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.600
Remember when it
used to be you and me,

05:11.720 --> 05:14.720
hitting it all night,
go hard or go home.

05:14.840 --> 05:17.680
[laughter]

05:17.800 --> 05:19.040
Something funny, is there?

05:19.160 --> 05:20.080
Forgive us, Mr. Ted.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.000
We're a bit wasted.

05:23.760 --> 05:24.600
Oh.

05:24.720 --> 05:26.080
Morning Rita.

05:26.200 --> 05:29.080
Fucking knock for fuck's sake.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.000
Shit.

05:30.120 --> 05:31.920
[knocking]

05:32.040 --> 05:34.440
Oh, look, it's the egg man.

05:34.560 --> 05:37.360
Go, go, gajou.

05:37.480 --> 05:39.000
You have a young
woman at this residence

05:39.120 --> 05:41.040
by the name of Cheryl Miller.

05:41.160 --> 05:42.560
What's her to you?

05:42.680 --> 05:44.480
Well, her mother, TrishMiller, is worried about her.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.040
And that's a
police matter how?

05:46.160 --> 05:49.640
Worried she might
be being corrupted.

05:49.760 --> 05:50.760
Corrupted?

05:50.880 --> 05:53.440
Or held against her will.

05:53.560 --> 05:54.960
[laughter]

05:55.080 --> 05:57.840
Yeah, this young officerhere is worried that we're

05:57.960 --> 05:59.800
corrupting Cheryl's morals.

05:59.920 --> 06:02.400
A bit bloody late for that.

06:02.520 --> 06:05.080
Wolf, Cheryl, get in here.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.400
So are you currently
on duty, Shane

06:07.520 --> 06:11.640
or are you trying to get
into Trish's pants now.

06:11.760 --> 06:13.680
I like to know what'sgoing on in my neighborhood.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.080
Your neighborhood, is it?

06:18.560 --> 06:20.240
Cheryl.

06:20.360 --> 06:21.840
Shane.

06:21.960 --> 06:24.320
Shane here was wonderingwhether you'd been kidnapped.

06:24.440 --> 06:25.240
By who?

06:25.360 --> 06:26.760
- By us.
- What?

06:26.880 --> 06:28.080
That's not what I mean.

06:28.200 --> 06:29.840
No, no, apparently
we're corrupting you.

06:29.960 --> 06:31.240
Your mother is
concerned you're

06:31.360 --> 06:33.400
being held against your will.

06:33.520 --> 06:36.640
Sometimes when I want to be.

06:36.760 --> 06:38.840
Mom's worried about you.

06:38.960 --> 06:39.840
I'm fine, Shane.

06:43.040 --> 06:47.760
As you can see,
everyone's fine here.

06:47.880 --> 06:50.600
[music playing]

06:52.160 --> 06:53.080
Well, good day.

06:53.200 --> 06:54.520
Good day.

06:54.640 --> 06:55.520
Is Rita here?

06:55.640 --> 06:56.800
No.

06:56.920 --> 06:58.440
It's just me.- Right, I'll be off then.

06:58.560 --> 07:01.080
Hey, it was funny seeingyou at that gay club, eh?

07:08.040 --> 07:10.800
Hey, you don't need
to be gay to be there.

07:10.920 --> 07:13.360
I mean, you were there
and you're not gay.

07:13.480 --> 07:15.040
No.

07:15.160 --> 07:19.640
But then I wasn't the one tonguediving another fellow, was I?

07:19.760 --> 07:20.880
Don't worry.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.560
I can be persuaded
not to tell anyone.

07:22.680 --> 07:23.480
You can?

07:23.600 --> 07:25.560
Yeah, if you cut me in.

07:25.680 --> 07:27.200
Look, we're not really
into that sort of thing.

07:27.320 --> 07:28.600
Come on.

07:28.720 --> 07:29.880
I know that you and Steveare up to something.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.440
- You know Steve?
- Yeah, from Rita's job.

07:35.320 --> 07:38.000
We weren't supposed to
use names, but he did.

07:38.120 --> 07:42.960
You two had me going thoughfor about 30 seconds.

07:43.080 --> 07:45.560
And then I realized.

07:45.680 --> 07:46.880
You did?

07:47.000 --> 07:48.160
Yeah, you were under
fucking cover, mate.

07:48.280 --> 07:50.400
You're casing the joint.

07:50.520 --> 07:52.120
Well, obviously.

07:52.240 --> 07:54.840
It's commitment to the job.

07:54.960 --> 07:59.680
Did Wolf realize that Iwas undercover and not a fag?

07:59.800 --> 08:01.800
Most of the time thesedays, you can put a snake up

08:01.920 --> 08:03.880
your ass, do the can-canand Wolf would still only

08:04.000 --> 08:06.040
be interested in Cheryl Miller.

08:06.160 --> 08:11.040
But, yeah, no, he thinks
that you're a puff.

08:11.160 --> 08:12.840
All right, $20 on [inaudible].

08:12.960 --> 08:13.800
You got it.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.440
Good luck, [inaudible].

08:15.560 --> 08:16.920
Speaking of hot
to trot phillies,

08:17.040 --> 08:18.760
I could go for a
gallop with her.

08:18.880 --> 08:22.440
Yeah, I'm not stopping you.

08:22.560 --> 08:24.000
Have you seen Wolf today?

08:24.120 --> 08:27.720
I've seen him drapedover Cheryl into the sack.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.200
So you haven't spoken to him?

08:29.320 --> 08:30.560
No, because that wouldinvolve him actually coming

08:30.680 --> 08:31.720
up for air at some point.

08:34.360 --> 08:36.440
Why are you asking about Wolf?

08:36.560 --> 08:40.080
Nothing, just the lads saw meworking undercover last night.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.680
Just worried there
was some confusion.

08:41.800 --> 08:42.640
It's not a big deal.

08:42.760 --> 08:43.800
Undercover?

08:43.920 --> 08:44.800
Yeah.

08:44.920 --> 08:45.960
Where?

08:46.080 --> 08:47.400
Well, this club
that I rolled into.

08:47.520 --> 08:48.840
Oh yeah?

08:48.960 --> 08:51.280
So what was so
confusing about that?

08:51.400 --> 08:54.360
It was mainly a gay club.

08:54.480 --> 08:56.320
A gay club?

08:56.440 --> 08:57.600
For gays?

08:57.720 --> 08:58.480
Yeah.

08:58.600 --> 09:02.680
[laughter]

09:02.800 --> 09:03.840
What's funny?

09:03.960 --> 09:04.880
Nothing, nothing.

09:05.000 --> 09:05.880
No, no, no, no,
Bilkey here has

09:06.000 --> 09:07.120
been pretending to be queer.

09:07.240 --> 09:08.600
[laughter]

09:08.720 --> 09:11.840
Apparently Wolf saw himat a gay club last night.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.720
Why was Wolf at a gay bar?

09:14.840 --> 09:17.440
No, no, no, no, my
son is very, very--

09:17.560 --> 09:21.320
[grunting and banging]

09:22.640 --> 09:24.040
Why were you pretending
to be a faggot?

09:24.160 --> 09:25.600
Actually, I was
casing the joint.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.240
Oh?

09:27.360 --> 09:30.760
Yeah, yeah, but it turns outit's barely worth our time.

09:30.880 --> 09:33.400
I know, but they must bringin what, a few thou every

09:33.520 --> 09:34.760
weekend in cash, of course?

09:34.880 --> 09:35.720
Maybe.

09:35.840 --> 09:37.320
And gay clubs are illegal.

09:37.440 --> 09:39.080
So although they'll squawklike chooks amongst themselves,

09:39.200 --> 09:40.800
they're hardly going to
get the cops involved.

09:40.920 --> 09:42.040
Yeah, but I think--

09:42.160 --> 09:43.480
Gays always look
really rich as well.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.240
Yeah, this could be justwhat we need, small job

09:45.360 --> 09:47.320
to help us with the next one.

09:47.440 --> 09:49.200
Hey, good work, mate.

09:56.800 --> 10:00.320
Oh, here you are, out of bed.

10:00.440 --> 10:02.680
Hi Rita.

10:02.800 --> 10:04.720
You shouldn't be doing that.

10:04.840 --> 10:06.560
I'm sure you have
far better things

10:06.680 --> 10:08.200
to do than wash Wolf's undies.

10:08.320 --> 10:10.880
Oh, honestly, I love
doing the washing.

10:11.000 --> 10:17.720
It's such a sense of home.

10:17.840 --> 10:20.480
Speaking of home, I'venoticed that you haven't been

10:20.600 --> 10:23.280
back to yours in quite a while.

10:23.400 --> 10:27.080
I'm a bit worried thatWolf might feel smothered.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.720
Well, I've offered
to go home loads,

10:28.840 --> 10:33.360
but Wolf begged me to stay so.

10:33.480 --> 10:34.280
It's pretty cute.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.520
What about that other guy?

10:40.640 --> 10:41.400
What other guy?

10:41.520 --> 10:42.600
Cop.

10:42.720 --> 10:44.840
He seems to care
where you're staying.

10:44.960 --> 10:48.400
Yeah, he's got thisstupid little thing for me.

10:48.520 --> 10:49.760
Does he?

10:49.880 --> 10:50.760
But it's nothing though.

10:50.880 --> 10:51.640
Really?

10:54.360 --> 10:56.120
[sigh]

10:56.240 --> 11:01.000
Look, Cheryl, I
hate to say this.

11:01.120 --> 11:03.840
But you know what we
do, right, for Crust?

11:03.960 --> 11:05.720
Illegal shit.

11:05.840 --> 11:09.320
Illegal shit, so
do you really think

11:09.440 --> 11:13.920
it's a good idea for us to havea cop sniffing around our house

11:14.040 --> 11:16.120
because of you?

11:16.240 --> 11:17.840
Probably not.

11:17.960 --> 11:20.800
I mean, we love
having you here.

11:20.920 --> 11:23.560
It's just unfortunately
right now,

11:23.680 --> 11:25.760
it's a shitty, shitty
time to have Constable

11:25.880 --> 11:27.240
Shane and his goo-goo eyes.

11:27.360 --> 11:29.080
Shane's harmless.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.120
No, love.

11:31.240 --> 11:32.160
He's a cop.

11:32.280 --> 11:33.040
Mm.

11:38.520 --> 11:39.560
Oh, no thanks.

11:44.520 --> 11:46.200
Operation Back
Door, we're going

11:46.320 --> 11:49.400
to rob a gay club via theback door, hence the name,

11:49.520 --> 11:51.840
Operation Back Door, obviously.

11:51.960 --> 11:54.360
Now Bilkey here is thebrains behind the operation.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.760
He risked his butt virginityby going undercover for us.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.000
Shit, well done, mate.

11:58.120 --> 12:00.960
We're going to rob
a bunch of pansies.

12:01.080 --> 12:01.840
Stop it.

12:01.960 --> 12:03.080
Just stop it fellows.

12:03.200 --> 12:06.120
Hey, has anybody
seen my teeth here?

12:06.240 --> 12:08.120
Yeah, I want to
put it in my bum.

12:08.240 --> 12:09.600
[laughter]

12:09.720 --> 12:11.600
That is awful.

12:11.720 --> 12:13.960
Oh, I don't reallywant to put it in my bum.

12:14.080 --> 12:15.680
I was just pretending to be gay.

12:15.800 --> 12:18.200
No, this whole idea is awful.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.240
I have a couple of cousins
who are homosexual.

12:20.360 --> 12:22.200
They have a hard enoughtime as it is without being

12:22.320 --> 12:24.120
ripped off by the likes of you.

12:24.240 --> 12:26.400
The likes of us?

12:26.520 --> 12:29.120
Yeah, well, maybe it
is a bit insensitive.

12:29.240 --> 12:30.000
More

12:30.120 --> 12:31.640
Than insensitive.

12:31.760 --> 12:34.680
Yeah, and what about our codeabout not ripping people off

12:34.800 --> 12:35.800
who don't deserve it.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.480
So how did the
fudge packers not

12:37.600 --> 12:40.240
work out that our Bilkey herewasn't really lifting shirts?

12:40.360 --> 12:42.760
He's as gay as my dick.

12:42.880 --> 12:44.880
Well, actually,
most gay people

12:45.000 --> 12:46.560
are just regular
dudes who happen

12:46.680 --> 12:49.240
to like other dudes trying tofind their place in the world.

12:49.360 --> 12:51.240
So Phineas could be gay.

12:51.360 --> 12:52.360
Just because I
can't [inaudible]

12:52.480 --> 12:53.800
doesn't mean I'm a [inaudible].

12:53.920 --> 12:55.160
- That's not what I mean.- Sure sounded like it.

12:55.280 --> 12:56.560
- It was a joke.- Yeah, well, not a funny one.

12:56.680 --> 12:57.440
OK.

13:02.200 --> 13:05.400
Look, I think there are risksthat we haven't considered.

13:05.520 --> 13:06.880
It's an illegal
operation as it is.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.880
The cops will be
sniffing around.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.880
I don't know, seemslike an easy score to me,

13:14.000 --> 13:15.080
exactly what we need right now.

13:17.960 --> 13:19.440
Steve's going to lose
it when he finds out.

13:19.560 --> 13:22.160
So why did you suggest
it in the first place?

13:22.280 --> 13:24.880
Wolf and his mates
saw me kissing Steve.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.280
I had to tell Tedsomething before they did.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.760
Really?

13:29.880 --> 13:34.800
Bilkey, those boys are justbackground noise to Ted.

13:34.920 --> 13:36.600
I have screwed
this up, haven't I?

13:36.720 --> 13:37.600
Yep, you have.

13:37.720 --> 13:39.240
So quit crying to me about it.

13:39.360 --> 13:42.960
All I care about is that Tedpulls off this job unscathed.

13:43.080 --> 13:44.000
Do not screw that up as well.

13:48.040 --> 13:50.120
OK, so we'll hit
the club early Sunday

13:50.240 --> 13:51.240
morning after the punters--

13:51.360 --> 13:52.600
Punters.

13:52.720 --> 13:56.960
--and the staff leave,
and out nice and clean.

13:57.080 --> 13:58.480
What's your deal
with the bar man?

13:58.600 --> 14:00.040
- Deal?
- Yeah, your mate?

14:00.160 --> 14:01.560
Are we cutting him in?

14:01.680 --> 14:05.880
No, he's opted out, busy,too many fingers in pies.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.080
OK, just us then.

14:08.200 --> 14:09.320
Sounds solid.

14:09.440 --> 14:11.200
We should do a Ricky.

14:11.320 --> 14:14.360
Hey, I mean,
actually go in there.

14:14.480 --> 14:16.240
I've got some old
blouses of Ngaire's.

14:16.360 --> 14:18.360
I was thinking
just me and Bilkey.

14:18.480 --> 14:19.880
I don't want to draw attention.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.600
You up for it?

14:21.720 --> 14:22.840
Sure.

14:22.960 --> 14:23.800
Ted?

14:23.920 --> 14:24.760
Ted's going to a guy club.

14:24.880 --> 14:27.680
[laughter]

14:31.480 --> 14:32.560
You've got to be
out of your mind.

14:32.680 --> 14:34.520
This is fascism.

14:34.640 --> 14:35.600
What am I supposed to say?

14:35.720 --> 14:36.920
[inaudible]

14:37.040 --> 14:38.440
Why don't you ever
stand up for yourself?

14:38.560 --> 14:42.840
[interposing voices]

14:42.960 --> 14:44.800
You OK?

14:44.920 --> 14:46.280
In about 10
seconds, Bert's going

14:46.400 --> 14:47.440
to walk through
that door, tell me

14:47.560 --> 14:48.840
he doesn't want to do the job.

14:48.960 --> 14:49.960
- Riana?
- Yeah.

14:50.080 --> 14:51.240
[knocking]

14:51.360 --> 14:52.400
Have you got a moment, Ted?

14:52.520 --> 14:54.240
I just, I need a quick word.

14:54.360 --> 14:55.160
Really Bert?

14:55.280 --> 14:57.200
What is it?

14:57.320 --> 14:58.560
I don't want to do the job.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.080
Is that so?

15:00.200 --> 15:03.600
Yeah, robbing queers isagainst my beliefs so, I'm out.

15:03.720 --> 15:05.880
And are these beliefs
directly linked to you

15:06.000 --> 15:06.920
getting your end away?

15:07.040 --> 15:08.480
No, no way.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.360
I just, I think we should beassessing things on a case

15:10.480 --> 15:14.480
to case scenario
because fascism.

15:14.600 --> 15:15.720
Because fascism?

15:15.840 --> 15:16.640
Yeah, yeah.

15:16.760 --> 15:18.360
And what does that mean?

15:18.480 --> 15:19.960
Well, because fascism is bad.

15:20.080 --> 15:21.680
Have you been reading
some books, Bert?

15:21.800 --> 15:23.240
Yeah, something like that.

15:23.360 --> 15:24.880
Well let me tell
you what I believe.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.080
I believe that I need to
be able to rely on you

15:27.200 --> 15:29.920
no matter what your woman says.

15:30.040 --> 15:32.640
So if you're out, Bert,
you're out for good.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.040
- Cheers for that tip.
- You're welcome.

15:37.160 --> 15:37.560
- OK.
- Yeah.

15:41.480 --> 15:43.000
Oh, hey there, handsome.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.440
What?

15:48.560 --> 15:50.080
We're robbing Backstage.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.320
Are you in?

15:51.440 --> 15:52.320
Why?

15:52.440 --> 15:53.720
Because there's money there.

15:53.840 --> 15:56.160
Do you want to play
be in the gang?

15:56.280 --> 15:58.040
This is what we do.

15:58.160 --> 15:59.760
You can't do that.

15:59.880 --> 16:02.840
I assure you we can.

16:02.960 --> 16:06.560
And if the police get involved,they'll know it's you.

16:09.560 --> 16:10.440
So you should leave now.

16:13.640 --> 16:14.400
Oh, for fuck's--

16:17.520 --> 16:18.680
I know what you're doing--

16:18.800 --> 16:19.960
Getting ready for bed.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.720
--with Cheryl and
it's not going to work,

16:21.840 --> 16:24.200
so just cut it out.

16:24.320 --> 16:25.640
Honestly, love,
you've lost me.

16:25.760 --> 16:28.160
Your little chat earliertoday, you're trying

16:28.280 --> 16:29.440
to use that cop to get rid her.

16:29.560 --> 16:30.760
No, I'm not at all.

16:30.880 --> 16:32.560
We just can't have
any extra attention

16:32.680 --> 16:34.160
from cops at the moment.

16:34.280 --> 16:36.480
Since when haven't we hadextra attention from the cops?

16:36.600 --> 16:39.560
Wolf, your father has alot going on at the moment.

16:39.680 --> 16:41.960
And having some hormonalpiglet sniffing around Cheryl

16:42.080 --> 16:42.840
could be a problem.

16:45.840 --> 16:48.400
I love her, Mom.

16:48.520 --> 16:51.080
And she's not going anywhere.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.600
So just stop it, OK?

17:03.080 --> 17:05.680
Tuck in, boys.

17:05.800 --> 17:08.960
But you do need to know that asmuch as I love having you all

17:09.080 --> 17:10.840
here, there are no free rides.

17:10.960 --> 17:15.640
So at some point, I willrequire you to pay your way.

17:15.760 --> 17:17.560
Well, I earn money from you.

17:17.680 --> 17:19.800
You know, you can
keep it if that helps.

17:19.920 --> 17:21.960
Mr. Bert employs
me to do car jobs.

17:22.080 --> 17:23.080
I can pay you with that money.

17:23.200 --> 17:24.560
But Sparky
doesn't do anything.

17:24.680 --> 17:25.960
He's a financial wasteland.

17:26.080 --> 17:27.960
No, no, what I mean,
boys, is don't you

17:28.080 --> 17:31.320
think that as a group, youneed to get out there, get

17:31.440 --> 17:34.640
busy, and bring me things thatI can sell through the galleria.

17:34.760 --> 17:36.160
That is really
Wolf's department.

17:36.280 --> 17:37.160
We just do what he says.

17:37.280 --> 17:38.240
Yeah, he's a bit distracted.

17:38.360 --> 17:40.400
Distracted by boobies.

17:40.520 --> 17:42.880
Yeah, it's a bit
complicated, isn't it?

17:43.000 --> 17:45.400
Well, no, not really,
he's just rooting heaps.

17:45.520 --> 17:49.880
No, no, no, I mean, withthe cop hanging around here,

17:50.000 --> 17:52.960
the one who accused you ofmolesting the other sister.

17:53.080 --> 17:57.840
It seems he's got a bit
of a crush on Cheryl,

17:57.960 --> 18:00.240
which makes her being
year a bit tricky,

18:00.360 --> 18:04.720
doesn't it, when you guysneed to get back in the game.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.240
But Cheryl's great.

18:06.360 --> 18:07.880
Yeah, yeah, you
know, she told me

18:08.000 --> 18:09.560
about how if you look
a girl in the eye,

18:09.680 --> 18:13.160
she thinks that you thinkthat she's a real person.

18:13.280 --> 18:14.880
She is the second best
dancer in the house.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.200
One time she cut off
a lock of her hair.

18:17.320 --> 18:19.080
She let me burn it.

18:19.200 --> 18:20.840
Who cleans your clothes, boys?

18:20.960 --> 18:22.240
Who cooks your meals?

18:22.360 --> 18:23.800
Actually, Cheryl andWolf have gone to the shop

18:23.920 --> 18:25.040
so they can make dinner.

18:25.160 --> 18:26.400
Wolf cooking?

18:29.440 --> 18:30.520
Hi Mom.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.080
Oh, Rita, I hope
this is all right.

18:32.200 --> 18:33.800
I was starting to
feel like a bludger,

18:33.920 --> 18:36.560
so I told Wolf I'd teach himhow to make my mom's fish pie.

18:36.680 --> 18:39.240
I hope you like fish pie.

18:39.360 --> 18:42.000
This just looks
absolutely delicious.

18:42.120 --> 18:43.920
This is better than good.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.240
Holy moly, Cheryl.

18:45.360 --> 18:49.960
Oh, fish pie, the
sexiest of all the pies.

18:50.080 --> 18:51.680
Can I serve you, Rita?

18:51.800 --> 18:53.160
Is it smoked fish?

18:53.280 --> 18:54.040
Yes.

18:54.160 --> 18:56.680
I don't eat smoked fish.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.120
So sorry, Rita.

18:58.240 --> 19:00.400
I had no idea.

19:00.520 --> 19:01.800
I can make you some toast.

19:01.920 --> 19:03.720
No, thank you, Cheryl.

19:03.840 --> 19:05.600
I prefer not to eat
breakfast for dinner.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.560
You know about my
smoked fish thing.

19:12.680 --> 19:13.600
Do I?

19:13.720 --> 19:15.280
It's typical.

19:15.400 --> 19:17.480
It is typical of the men in thishouse that don't bloody listen.

19:17.600 --> 19:20.320
We give it our
best shot, love.

19:20.440 --> 19:21.240
How do I look?

19:26.160 --> 19:28.240
That was a damn fine
pie, by the way.

19:28.360 --> 19:31.000
Sure you want to say thatwith my hands near your throat?

19:31.120 --> 19:32.240
Stop fighting it, Rita.

19:32.360 --> 19:34.160
She's here for the
foreseeable future.

19:34.280 --> 19:37.080
So you're OK then
with Riana having

19:37.200 --> 19:38.560
Bert wrapped around her twat?

19:38.680 --> 19:40.040
That's different.

19:40.160 --> 19:41.440
Is it?

19:41.560 --> 19:43.040
A woman who gets tooinvolved in men's matters

19:43.160 --> 19:44.400
is going to cause problems.

19:44.520 --> 19:46.000
And once they
entrench themselves,

19:46.120 --> 19:46.880
no getting rid of them.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.720
At least you won't have todeal with any strappy Sheilas

19:51.840 --> 19:52.680
tonight--

19:52.800 --> 19:54.200
Amen to that.

19:54.320 --> 19:57.000
--just a few handsy boys.

19:57.120 --> 19:59.880

20:00.000 --> 20:02.320
[inaudible tv]

20:02.440 --> 20:03.240
Evening.

20:06.240 --> 20:08.760
Dad, your date's here.

20:08.880 --> 20:11.400
Hey, so are you and Ted goingto make out like you and Steve

20:11.520 --> 20:13.480
had to?

20:13.600 --> 20:14.600
No.

20:14.720 --> 20:15.840
Bilkey.

20:15.960 --> 20:16.840
Ted.

20:16.960 --> 20:18.160
Let's do this.

20:18.280 --> 20:19.760
Watch out for
sexy drag queens.

20:19.880 --> 20:22.760
[laughter]
- Carol.

20:22.880 --> 20:24.480
[crying]

20:24.600 --> 20:25.360
What's happened?

20:31.200 --> 20:33.480
Dude, I have to
be honest with you.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.160
I'm still not convinced.

20:35.280 --> 20:36.480
Ah, damn it.

20:36.600 --> 20:37.640
I knew I should have
gone with the paisley.

20:37.760 --> 20:39.800
No, I mean the job.
You look fine.

20:39.920 --> 20:41.000
Really?

20:41.120 --> 20:42.680
I'm far more concerned
about passing

20:42.800 --> 20:46.080
myself off as a jobby jabbertonight than the actual job.

20:46.200 --> 20:47.480
I mean, I've seen
"Hudson and Halls."

20:47.600 --> 20:51.280
And I'm fairly sure one
of them is, you know?

20:51.400 --> 20:52.560
I can't remember which one.

20:52.680 --> 20:54.120
But have a fair idea
what it's all about.

20:54.240 --> 20:55.640
Right.

20:55.760 --> 20:59.080
Hey, reckon we could passourselves off as a couple?

20:59.200 --> 21:00.160
[laughter]

21:00.280 --> 21:01.520
[music playing]

21:01.640 --> 21:04.520
[SINGING] I am dancing
on the floor for you.

21:04.640 --> 21:07.440
And I feel like a [inaudible].

21:07.560 --> 21:10.920
And I feel your
body close to mine.

21:11.040 --> 21:12.880
And I know [inaudible].

21:13.000 --> 21:15.600
Ted.

21:15.720 --> 21:18.000
Far out.

21:18.120 --> 21:20.640
This is far out.

21:20.760 --> 21:22.320
Guess so.

21:22.440 --> 21:25.520
Bilkey, it's been a while.

21:25.640 --> 21:26.480
Yeah.

21:26.600 --> 21:27.360
Good to see you.

21:27.480 --> 21:29.680
You too.

21:29.800 --> 21:32.240
How come everyone knows
you by your real name?

21:32.360 --> 21:34.600
I think it's less suspiciousthan staring blankly

21:34.720 --> 21:37.160
at someone who is [inaudible].

21:37.280 --> 21:38.840
Yeah, fair enough.

21:38.960 --> 21:41.640
But just call me Ed.

21:41.760 --> 21:43.320
I'll know who you mean.

21:43.440 --> 21:44.560
OK, Ed.

21:50.040 --> 21:53.280
So we've been trying to adopt.

21:53.400 --> 21:54.320
Really?

21:54.440 --> 21:56.040
Phineas is OK with it?

21:56.160 --> 21:57.680
We kept it a secret
because we didn't

21:57.800 --> 22:03.040
want to get anyone's hopes up,including ours, mainly ours.

22:03.160 --> 22:06.800
But we did get our
hopes up until today.

22:11.520 --> 22:14.280
Mr. O'Driscoll, have
you ever been in jail?

22:14.400 --> 22:15.880
Why?

22:16.000 --> 22:16.840
Have you?

22:16.960 --> 22:17.720
No.

22:17.840 --> 22:21.000
But you have, haven't you?

22:21.120 --> 22:23.280
If that miserable
woman can't see

22:23.400 --> 22:27.240
that you would be the world'sbest mom, she's an idiot.

22:27.360 --> 22:31.040
She's also the woman whoturned down our application.

22:31.160 --> 22:34.160
I think she's an idiot.

22:34.280 --> 22:35.240
You'd be the best mom ever.

22:42.280 --> 22:45.600
[knocking]

22:45.720 --> 22:48.280
[knocking]

22:48.400 --> 22:49.880
Is Ted here?

22:50.000 --> 22:51.280
No, he's not.

22:51.400 --> 22:53.360
I need a word with him.

22:53.480 --> 22:55.520
I'll tell him you called.

22:55.640 --> 22:57.560
Picking on the mostvulnerable members of society

22:57.680 --> 22:59.280
and giving my Bert an ultimatum.

22:59.400 --> 23:00.840
Bert has a choice.

23:00.960 --> 23:02.760
And if Bert has a problem,then he should speak to Ted

23:02.880 --> 23:04.200
instead of hiding behind you.

23:04.320 --> 23:05.960
You don't care, do you?

23:06.080 --> 23:08.360
Because misogyny and homophobiaperpetuate your role in

23:08.480 --> 23:11.240
this world, baking sconesfor your redneck man.

23:11.360 --> 23:12.760
I get that you
go to university

23:12.880 --> 23:14.000
and you really like
to use big words,

23:14.120 --> 23:17.120
but I have no idea
what you just said.

23:17.240 --> 23:20.440
Bert's business
is also my business.

23:20.560 --> 23:22.760
That plain enough for you?

23:22.880 --> 23:24.720
And I stay out
of Ted's business

23:24.840 --> 23:26.040
because that's how it's done.

23:26.160 --> 23:27.360
Because it suits you.

23:27.480 --> 23:29.920
No, because it works.

23:30.040 --> 23:32.240
Maybe things
are different now.

23:32.360 --> 23:34.360
Is that so, is it?

23:34.480 --> 23:36.800
There's a thing
called feminism, Rita.

23:36.920 --> 23:38.760
I have heard of it, yes.

23:38.880 --> 23:41.040
We have a right to an opinionof what our men are up to.

23:41.160 --> 23:42.800
Right.

23:42.920 --> 23:46.760
So we all burned our brasso I can stick my nose

23:46.880 --> 23:48.360
into my husband's
illegal affairs

23:48.480 --> 23:49.880
and deem which ones are worthy?

23:53.240 --> 23:55.920
Carol, get more glasses.

23:56.040 --> 23:58.240
You two bitches need somelessons about how things

23:58.360 --> 23:59.720
work here in the real world.

23:59.840 --> 24:01.160
I don't think
calling other women

24:01.280 --> 24:02.960
bitches is very feminist, Rita.

24:03.080 --> 24:05.400
Get the glasses, Carol.

24:05.520 --> 24:07.800
[music playing]

24:09.360 --> 24:11.200
So as you can see,
the party doesn't

24:11.320 --> 24:13.840
die down until the small hours.

24:13.960 --> 24:17.000
Now, the office, where the moneyis kept is around the back.

24:17.120 --> 24:18.920
Why are there so
many dolly birds?

24:19.040 --> 24:20.720
Or are they lesbians?

24:20.840 --> 24:22.440
No, fag hags.

24:22.560 --> 24:23.600
What?

24:23.720 --> 24:25.880
Fag hags.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.560
Some women just want
to dance without being

24:27.680 --> 24:30.600
hit on all the time.

24:30.720 --> 24:32.440
Well, I'll be.

24:32.560 --> 24:34.320
So the office,
as I was saying,

24:34.440 --> 24:35.920
is around the back
of the building.

24:36.040 --> 24:38.960
Everyone looks so free.

24:39.080 --> 24:41.120
There is no alarm and no safe.

24:41.240 --> 24:45.320
I loved a man
once, my cellmate,

24:45.440 --> 24:47.000
Mark, in prison, you know?

24:47.120 --> 24:50.640
It was so intense, unnatural.

24:53.800 --> 24:56.560
What happens in jail
stays in jail, right?

24:56.680 --> 24:57.880
Right.

24:58.000 --> 24:58.800
My lips are sealed.

25:03.760 --> 25:05.160
I'll get another
round then, eh?

25:05.280 --> 25:06.120
No, no, I'll go.

25:13.040 --> 25:14.800
Two Manhattans.

25:14.920 --> 25:15.960
Please don't do this.

25:16.080 --> 25:19.120
Don't you dare say a word.

25:19.240 --> 25:21.480
Two Manhattans, please.

25:21.600 --> 25:27.600
[music playing]

25:27.720 --> 25:29.640
Oh, yes, that's the
problem with you lot.

25:29.760 --> 25:31.240
My lot?

25:31.360 --> 25:33.160
You're so concerned withyour precious women's studies

25:33.280 --> 25:35.800
that you're not actuallyequipped to deal with reality.

25:35.920 --> 25:38.960
What's women's studies going todo for you when you're knocked

25:39.080 --> 25:40.680
up barefoot in the kitchen?

25:40.800 --> 25:41.760
That's kind of
offensive, Rita.

25:41.880 --> 25:43.400
Yeah, it is.

25:43.520 --> 25:46.040
But it's what we have to dealwith here in the real world.

25:46.160 --> 25:47.760
And I know that
you two, you think

25:47.880 --> 25:50.360
that you're changing the waywe do things, but you're not.

25:50.480 --> 25:53.000
It's better than lettingthe Neanderthals run riot.

25:53.120 --> 25:54.760
It's a man's world, Riana.

25:54.880 --> 25:58.080
And you're just pissing themoff by sticking your nose in.

25:58.200 --> 26:00.680
Do you want Bert to get
kicked out of the gang?

26:00.800 --> 26:04.840
Better than being a yes
man to your Ted forever.

26:04.960 --> 26:06.160
Really?

26:06.280 --> 26:09.720
And what about all the
flash stuff he buys you?

26:09.840 --> 26:11.480
You like that, don't you?

26:11.600 --> 26:14.120
And I know that you
like bad men too.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.040
I've watched you.

26:16.160 --> 26:17.480
Busted.

26:17.600 --> 26:19.160
And you can keep yourmouth shut because you're

26:19.280 --> 26:20.720
exactly the same.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.240
Hm.

I'll get hungry.

You want to know why?

26:38.320 --> 26:39.320
Why?

26:39.440 --> 26:41.400
Gays want to be
treated as equals,

26:41.520 --> 26:43.920
then welcome to the real world.

26:44.040 --> 26:45.400

you have means, a moredelicate way of doing things.

Maybe some of us arealready doing that, Rita.

Oh, no, there's anotherword for that, slutty pants.

27:04.400 --> 27:06.520
I'm sorry, what?

27:06.640 --> 27:07.680
Pretty sure you heard me.

I wouldn't let Mrs. Ritahear you call her that.

27:30.880 --> 27:33.440
Your mom had a good pointthough about the cop liking

27:33.560 --> 27:36.400
Cheryl and him hanging around.

27:36.520 --> 27:38.200
Mom's points
always sound good,

27:38.320 --> 27:41.080
but she'll come around
to Cheryl being here.

You'll see.

29:19.720 --> 29:21.440
Rita's had a great idea.

29:21.560 --> 29:22.640
What?

29:22.760 --> 29:25.600
Well, and he'd be
such a great dad.

29:25.720 --> 29:27.320
Is he taking the piss?

29:27.440 --> 29:28.800
I'll explain in the car.

29:34.280 --> 29:36.200
- Bye to you.
- Bye Rita.

29:36.320 --> 29:37.120
Bye Carol.

29:40.560 --> 29:43.480
I just came to
see if she's OK.

29:43.600 --> 29:45.240
Equal opportunity
for getting done over.

29:45.360 --> 29:46.160
He's back in.

29:49.880 --> 29:52.280
Yeah.

29:52.400 --> 29:53.680
My gay cousins are bitches.

29:58.960 --> 30:01.080
Pretty sure the place wasn'tlike this when I left it.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.600
Well, sometimes youhave to break a few eggs,

30:03.720 --> 30:08.160
ruffle a few feathers to bringstrappy women back into line.

30:08.280 --> 30:09.760
Oh?

30:09.880 --> 30:13.320
Do you want to bring thisstrappy woman back into line?

30:13.440 --> 30:16.640
Double check you haven't
turned gay on me.

30:16.760 --> 30:18.120
[chuckling]

30:19.720 --> 30:20.600
[moaning]

30:20.720 --> 30:23.080
[grunting in distance]

30:23.200 --> 30:25.200
Oh, for fuck's
sake, she should

30:25.320 --> 30:27.320
be crutches with her
head in a bucket.

30:27.440 --> 30:29.760
I hope she's bloody
brushed her teeth.

30:29.880 --> 30:30.720
Yes!

30:30.840 --> 30:33.160
Oh!

30:33.280 --> 30:35.840
No, don't stop.

30:35.960 --> 30:37.680
- What?
- Keep going.

30:37.800 --> 30:39.480
[grunting]

30:39.600 --> 30:40.360
Oh.

30:40.480 --> 30:42.560
Oh, oh, yeah.

30:42.680 --> 30:43.960
Isn't getting off
while our son's

30:44.080 --> 30:45.440
getting off a wee bit strange.

30:45.560 --> 30:47.560
Get your head
in the game, Ted.

30:47.680 --> 30:49.040
Oh, yes.

30:49.160 --> 30:50.280
Oh, yes.

30:50.400 --> 30:51.200
Oh.

30:51.320 --> 30:53.440
Yes, yes.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.000
Oh, gross.

30:55.120 --> 30:57.280
Yeah, now!

30:57.400 --> 30:59.280
Don't you dare stop now.

30:59.400 --> 31:00.280
[moaning]

31:00.400 --> 31:01.240
Wolf!

31:01.360 --> 31:02.240
Ah!

31:02.360 --> 31:04.240
Mm, mm, mm, mm.

31:04.360 --> 31:05.200
Oh, Wolf.

31:05.320 --> 31:06.280
Oh, Ted.

31:06.400 --> 31:07.200
Ted!

31:07.320 --> 31:08.680
Oh.

31:08.800 --> 31:12.640
[moaning]

31:21.680 --> 31:25.000
[inaudible]

31:25.120 --> 31:26.640
Oh, morning, Rita.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.360
Lemon and sugar or
bacon and banana?

31:43.600 --> 31:45.520
Morning, Mrs. West.

31:51.160 --> 31:52.920
What the hell
was he doing here?

31:53.040 --> 31:53.840
Browsing?

31:53.960 --> 31:55.160
Don't bloody think so.

31:55.280 --> 31:56.520
Well, that's what
it looked like to me.

31:56.640 --> 31:57.920
Why?
Do you know him?

31:58.040 --> 31:58.840
Do you?

31:58.960 --> 32:00.160
He's a cop.

32:00.280 --> 32:01.440
No.

32:01.560 --> 32:03.160
And good morning to you too.

32:06.920 --> 32:08.200
Bit shabby on it, are we?

32:08.320 --> 32:11.040
All in a good
cause, drinking Wolf's

32:11.160 --> 32:13.080
little slut under the table.

32:13.200 --> 32:14.120
So not a fan?

32:14.240 --> 32:15.520
Of her?
No.

32:15.640 --> 32:17.000
Well, tell her
to piss off then.

32:17.120 --> 32:18.880
Doesn't really
seem to be working.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.240
Moved in?

32:20.360 --> 32:23.200
Permanently attached
to my son's privates.

32:23.320 --> 32:25.120
Well, what about her parents?

32:25.240 --> 32:26.680
Her mother is trash too.

32:26.800 --> 32:28.360
No, I mean her
mother who presumably

32:28.480 --> 32:31.480
dislikes Wolf as much asyou dislike her daughter.

32:31.600 --> 32:33.600
It involves swallowing
some pride, Rita,

32:33.720 --> 32:36.720
but used to work with Desireeand the boys I disapproved of.

32:47.520 --> 32:48.360
[ding dong]

32:51.880 --> 32:54.320
I thought I banned you.

32:54.440 --> 32:59.800
I'm here to return what
is rightfully yours.

32:59.920 --> 33:02.000
Your daughter.

33:02.120 --> 33:03.680
No, thanks.

33:03.800 --> 33:05.360
What?

33:05.480 --> 33:06.320
But you have to.

33:06.440 --> 33:08.840
No, she is your problem now.

33:08.960 --> 33:10.480
She's your daughter.

33:10.600 --> 33:12.520
You can't just wash your handsof your own flesh and blood.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.520
You're joking, right?

33:17.640 --> 33:19.960
About never having another2 AM call from the place

33:20.080 --> 33:21.680
informing me that
my daughter has

33:21.800 --> 33:23.920
accidentally incited a riot?

33:24.040 --> 33:26.440
Oh, I don't think so.

33:26.560 --> 33:27.960
But you can't--

33:28.080 --> 33:31.040
Look, lady, I'm way toobusy dealing with another one

33:31.160 --> 33:34.680
of my daughters so gutted thather sister stole her boyfriend

33:34.800 --> 33:36.560
I've had to send her tostay with my Bible-bashing

33:36.680 --> 33:38.160
aunt in Masterton.

33:38.280 --> 33:41.600
But it's your responsibilityas a mother to take her--

33:41.720 --> 33:46.280
As a mother, I'm sick ofdealing with Cheryl's crap.

33:46.400 --> 33:47.200
She's your problem now.

34:13.040 --> 34:14.920
You better be good for it.

34:15.040 --> 34:15.960
You know I am.

34:23.720 --> 34:25.800
You guys should go now.

34:25.920 --> 34:29.440
I want a quick word with Cheryl.

34:29.560 --> 34:31.400
Maybe go get some
beers for later.

34:31.520 --> 34:32.280
Mm.

34:32.400 --> 34:33.720
Be nice to her?

34:33.840 --> 34:35.520
Nice is my middle name.

34:35.640 --> 34:36.400
[inaudible] boys.

34:42.400 --> 34:46.440
So apparently,
I'm stuck with you.

34:46.560 --> 34:51.120
But you and Wolf need to sortout the shit with that cop.

34:51.240 --> 34:53.960
I mean it.

34:54.080 --> 34:55.440
[knocking]

34:55.560 --> 34:57.040
[inaudible]

34:57.160 --> 34:58.720
Ted is just getting ready.

34:58.840 --> 35:01.200
I thought I might grab you asec before the game show, eh?

35:01.320 --> 35:03.560
Looking for some sympathy forthe mess you got yourself into.

35:03.680 --> 35:04.480
I can't do this.

35:04.600 --> 35:05.800
Yes, you can.

35:05.920 --> 35:07.360
Yoohoo.

35:07.480 --> 35:09.480
Carol, you're here early too.

35:09.600 --> 35:12.680
We wanted to talk to
you about something.

35:12.800 --> 35:15.480
We want to adopt Sparky,just as a trial to see if we

35:15.600 --> 35:17.600
really would make good parents.

35:17.720 --> 35:20.840
Would that be
OK with you, Rita?

35:20.960 --> 35:26.400
Well, Sparky is his
own person and pretty

35:26.520 --> 35:28.000
much a fully grown adult man.

35:28.120 --> 35:32.600
So I guess you'll have toask him when he gets back.

35:32.720 --> 35:34.440
OK, fine.

35:34.560 --> 35:35.440
Lefty.

35:35.560 --> 35:37.160
- You guys all set?
- Yes.

35:37.280 --> 35:38.400
Hey guys.

35:38.520 --> 35:40.040
How are you feeling?

35:40.160 --> 35:42.280
Like someone shit between thetwo hemispheres of my brain.

35:42.400 --> 35:43.160
Today we'll stick to tea.

35:47.200 --> 35:50.160
OK, nimble heads,
easy job, in and out,

35:50.280 --> 35:51.480
could do it in our sleep.

35:51.600 --> 35:52.960
There will be no surprises.

35:58.720 --> 36:00.080
Hey, you all keen to party?

36:00.200 --> 36:01.040
Oh, god no.

36:01.160 --> 36:02.800
I guess it's just us then.

36:06.880 --> 36:09.480
Sparky, Phineas
and I were wondering

36:09.600 --> 36:11.520
if we could adopt you.

36:11.640 --> 36:12.480
Really?

36:12.600 --> 36:13.360
You want me?

36:13.480 --> 36:14.280
Yes.

36:14.400 --> 36:16.640
Then yeah.

36:16.760 --> 36:18.560
We'll leave in the
morning when your father

36:18.680 --> 36:19.840
gets back from his robbery.

36:19.960 --> 36:21.840
So it's Sparky's
going away party.

36:21.960 --> 36:23.960
Downstairs in the basement.

36:24.080 --> 36:26.920
All right.

36:27.040 --> 36:28.880
There's something
we need to do.

36:41.840 --> 36:42.720
It's time.

36:58.640 --> 37:00.480
Good morning Bilkey.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.400
Who the fuck are you?

37:02.520 --> 37:05.880
I'm Bilkey's
boyfriend, ex-boyfriend.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.560
I thought I'd help you outand get your money ready

37:07.680 --> 37:10.360
so here it is.

37:10.480 --> 37:13.400
But you should know thatBilkey and I were lovers.

37:13.520 --> 37:15.360
He's as gay as the day is long.

37:15.480 --> 37:16.840
Aren't you Bilkey?

37:16.960 --> 37:18.120
You're a queer?

37:30.760 --> 37:31.520
Cheers.

37:38.240 --> 37:39.000
Come on.

37:48.200 --> 37:49.360
No surprises?

37:49.480 --> 37:50.560
Just the one.

37:50.680 --> 37:51.680
Well, you've got
the money though.

37:51.800 --> 37:55.040
Yes, Phineas,
we got the money.

37:55.160 --> 37:57.160
I am gay.

37:57.280 --> 37:59.720
But you was only in
there for five minutes.

37:59.840 --> 38:01.560
I've always been gay.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.840
He wasn't lying, just in
case you were wondering.

38:06.960 --> 38:08.520
I'm missing something here.

38:08.640 --> 38:10.600
Bilkey's a homo.

38:10.720 --> 38:13.000
What about all thosechicks you were rogering?

38:13.120 --> 38:14.800
Never touched any of them.

38:14.920 --> 38:17.280
I just used them so that
you guys wouldn't twick.

38:17.400 --> 38:18.880
I'd give them the flick
whenever it got serious.

38:23.200 --> 38:26.880
Well, look, we don't careabout any of that, do we, lads?

38:27.000 --> 38:30.520
Bilkey's private life is
Bilkey's private life.

38:30.640 --> 38:32.160
Shit, we're not cavemen.

38:32.280 --> 38:33.320
Each to their own
and all of that.

38:33.440 --> 38:34.200
Isn't that right?

38:38.000 --> 38:38.800
Isn't that right?

38:42.680 --> 38:45.800
I thought you werethis legendary stick man.

38:45.920 --> 38:47.480
But you like boys.

38:47.600 --> 38:49.960
No, I like men.

39:02.480 --> 39:05.160
But only the ones that areinto that sort of thing, right?

39:05.280 --> 39:06.560
Yes, Phineas.

39:06.680 --> 39:07.480
Which is not me.

39:12.920 --> 39:13.800
Then whatever.

39:20.520 --> 39:21.280
[inaudible] brother.

39:27.400 --> 39:29.080
Hey, I went to a
boys' boarding school.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.640
I've seen things, gay things.

39:31.760 --> 39:34.080
There was a kid there who wentout with the school goat once.

39:34.200 --> 39:36.840
Yeah, it's not really
the same thing, Lefty.

39:36.960 --> 39:38.800
Right, well,
that's that sorted.

39:38.920 --> 39:41.240
So we get on with theget away, gentlemen, huh?

39:41.360 --> 39:43.560
[engine revving]

39:46.520 --> 39:48.000
Hey, Mandy,
what's the problem?

39:48.120 --> 39:48.880
Mom OK?

39:49.000 --> 39:50.200
It's not mom.

39:50.320 --> 39:52.840
She's away.
It's her.

39:52.960 --> 39:53.880
She made me.

39:54.000 --> 39:54.800
Get lost, Trent.

39:54.920 --> 39:55.720
Shut up.

39:59.120 --> 40:01.080
Thank you for coming, Shane.

40:01.200 --> 40:03.040
It's about Wolf.

40:03.160 --> 40:04.680
I knew it.

40:04.800 --> 40:08.000
I knew you didn't reallywant to be with that animal.

40:08.120 --> 40:12.600
Oh, but I do, Shane becausethat animal is my boyfriend who

40:12.720 --> 40:13.760
I love very much.

40:19.560 --> 40:22.160
If he's making you say this,Cheryl, I can protect you.

40:22.280 --> 40:25.560
No one can make me doanything I don't want to, Shane.

40:25.680 --> 40:28.320
I'm with Wolf and
you need to butt out.

40:28.440 --> 40:31.360
And you need to leavehim and his family alone.

40:31.480 --> 40:32.720
Or I'll tell everyone
about the time you

40:32.840 --> 40:36.600
copped a feel when I was 13.

40:36.720 --> 40:38.680
That never happened.

40:38.800 --> 40:39.920
Then don't make me say it did.

40:42.680 --> 40:44.400
You should leave now.

40:44.520 --> 40:47.840
[music playing]

41:03.800 --> 41:06.360
Oy, tradition is a
beer after the job.

41:06.480 --> 41:09.960
Or is it that Miami winecooler you puffs drink?

41:10.080 --> 41:11.320
Not really in the mood.

41:11.440 --> 41:12.760
What?

41:12.880 --> 41:14.120
You're going to get allmoody now that you're gay?

41:14.240 --> 41:15.040
Get inside.

41:24.400 --> 41:25.200
Hi, love.

41:30.480 --> 41:32.120
Carol, I'm home.

41:32.240 --> 41:35.120
Hey.

41:35.240 --> 41:36.600
How did it go?

41:36.720 --> 41:37.600
It was weird.

41:37.720 --> 41:39.400
That's nice.

41:39.520 --> 41:42.680
I have something to tell you.

41:42.800 --> 41:44.120
Good one?

41:44.240 --> 41:46.560
Enough.

41:46.680 --> 41:48.400
You known that he's gay
for ages, haven't you?

41:52.120 --> 41:54.080
We cost him his boyfriend.

41:54.200 --> 41:56.880
No, he cost him his boyfriend.

41:59.320 --> 42:00.840
Morning.

42:00.960 --> 42:02.800
Not quite the relationshipyou happened to break up, eh?

42:05.560 --> 42:06.360
Dig in, boys.

42:14.080 --> 42:15.800
Cheers.

42:15.920 --> 42:17.360
Cheers.

42:17.480 --> 42:19.800
The cop problem has gone away.

42:19.920 --> 42:20.840
You sure?

42:20.960 --> 42:23.960
I'm sure of everything, Mom.

42:24.080 --> 42:25.880
Phineas, I want
you to meet our son.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.200
Well, he's not really
our son, but he's

42:28.320 --> 42:29.720
coming to live with us.

42:29.840 --> 42:31.120
Hey Dad.

42:31.240 --> 42:36.280
So I guess you're one
of us now, slutty pants.

42:36.400 --> 42:38.400
Don't call me slutty pants.

42:38.520 --> 42:39.400
Why?

42:39.520 --> 42:44.320
Does it annoy you, slutty pants?

42:44.440 --> 42:47.200
You are such a bitch.

42:47.320 --> 42:50.040
Takes one to know
one, slutty pants.

42:53.480 --> 42:54.240
Come here.

43:07.880 --> 43:12.000
