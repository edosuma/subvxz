Everyone was playing well,

because our comps were clean.

of credit to Cream for that.

Fugitive's comps

00:49.397 --> 00:51.007
have been centered
around Creamcheese.

No, no, that's it, that's it,
that's it, that's yours.

00:52.965 --> 00:54.837

Everyone else feeds him info

00:54.880 --> 00:56.143
and he decides
what to do with it.

00:56.186 --> 00:57.535
And they say, "I can fight,"

or not they should fight.

PHREAK: Creamcheese looking
for the engagement

01:05.630 --> 01:07.415
and jumps right on in,
and it's gonna be an easy fall

01:07.458 --> 01:10.287
where you cannot
defend this one.

01:10.331 --> 01:12.115
All right, nice. Thanks, Cream.

Cream sets up a fight

took an interest in streaming,

05:37.162 --> 05:38.338

08:46.700 --> 08:48.310
we go Karma, Ez.

08:50.791 --> 08:52.270
RUDY JR.:
Yo, yo, we got to bounce.

08:52.314 --> 08:53.837
Time to get over to the school.
We running late.

08:53.881 --> 08:55.752
-See you in a bit.
-Fuck.

08:56.579 --> 08:58.059
I'll call you back.

08:58.102 --> 09:01.279
It's fine. Come on.
I'm gonna come with you.

09:02.237 --> 09:04.239
♪

09:05.022 --> 09:06.937
CREAMCHEESE: I'm really not
jealous that Rudy has Org doing

09:06.981 --> 09:08.983
all this sponsorship
during finals week.

09:09.026 --> 09:10.680
Like, I'm not.
It's just a little annoying

09:10.724 --> 09:12.943
that he doesn't seem

09:12.987 --> 09:15.729
to appreciate that this is
as close to a championship

09:15.772 --> 09:16.860
as we've been in years.

09:16.904 --> 09:18.122
RUDY JR.:
Hey, yo, PJ.

09:18.166 --> 09:19.341
I'll see you in a bit,
all right?

09:19.384 --> 09:20.908
All right.

09:20.951 --> 09:23.693
And I'm sorry, but I'd like
to have my ADC in scrims.

09:23.737 --> 09:26.522
The point is, is that there are
so many different careers

09:26.566 --> 09:27.871
in gaming. I'm a streamer,

09:27.915 --> 09:30.178
Rudy works behind the scenes
in business,

09:30.221 --> 09:32.572
and Org is a pro player.

09:34.443 --> 09:35.966
I agree.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.447
Right, well, uh...

09:38.490 --> 09:40.231
ORGANIZM: I don't even know
why they wanted

09:40.275 --> 09:41.885
to hear my advice anyway.

09:41.929 --> 09:43.887
In the lane phase,
I noticed you play aggro

09:43.931 --> 09:45.715
with tanky supports.
Is that just you...

09:45.759 --> 09:47.064
ORGANIZM:
'Cause when I went there,

09:47.108 --> 09:49.676
they said I was the weird kid.

09:49.719 --> 09:51.939
The crazy kid.

09:56.552 --> 10:00.077
SIMONE: I got a call one day
from the school.

10:00.121 --> 10:02.514
And they said that Percy
had been involved

10:02.558 --> 10:04.212
-in an incident.
-[chuckles]

10:04.255 --> 10:06.083
He wasn't just involved.

10:06.127 --> 10:08.738
RUDY JR.:
In gym class one day,

10:08.782 --> 10:10.261
some kid named Todd,

10:10.305 --> 10:13.787
he came up,
and he pantsed Percy.

10:13.830 --> 10:15.353
TODD:
I was messing around,

10:15.397 --> 10:17.529
trying to make people laugh
and be funny.

10:17.573 --> 10:19.096
I mean, it wasfunny.

10:19.140 --> 10:21.098
He didn't even seem that pissed
at the time.

10:21.142 --> 10:22.883
It was typical
high school fuckery, man.

10:22.926 --> 10:24.449
I used to pants my friends
all the time.

10:24.493 --> 10:26.016
It's a classic.

10:26.060 --> 10:28.758
But don't nobody hold a grudge
like my little brother.

10:28.802 --> 10:31.413
And he does so quietly.

10:31.456 --> 10:33.633
Until he explodes.

10:36.853 --> 10:38.812
TODD:
We had these bags of milk

10:38.855 --> 10:41.684
that we had to poke with a straw
like a Capri Sun.

10:41.728 --> 10:44.469
And he smacks me on the back
of the head with a milk bag.

10:45.253 --> 10:48.909
This shit hurts,
and I'm covered in milk.

10:48.952 --> 10:50.954
So, I turn around,
and I'm staring at him,

10:50.998 --> 10:53.130
and he doesn't do anything.

10:53.870 --> 10:56.003
Almost like he's asking
to be hit.

10:57.352 --> 10:59.310
ORGANIZM:
I'm a pretty bad fighter,

10:59.354 --> 11:03.967
so I pretty much knew I was
gonna get my ass beat, but..

11:04.011 --> 11:06.448
only one of us
was covered in milk.

11:06.491 --> 11:08.668
We both got suspended
for three days.

11:08.711 --> 11:10.147
RUDY:
I should have been angry

11:10.191 --> 11:12.367
because he was the first Elmore
to get suspended,

11:12.410 --> 11:14.978
but Percy said
he was standing up for himself,

11:15.022 --> 11:17.502
so I was okay with it at first.

11:17.546 --> 11:19.156
So, getting suspended
means that you, like, home

11:19.200 --> 11:20.418
for three or four days
or something.

11:20.462 --> 11:21.898
So, for any other kid,
that's like

11:21.942 --> 11:23.683
a week of watching TV
or some shit.

11:23.726 --> 11:27.774
But for Percy, it was like
50 extra hours on the Rift.

11:28.862 --> 11:29.950
When we come back
from suspension,

11:29.993 --> 11:31.168
he's still laughing

11:31.212 --> 11:33.518
like he's better than me
or something.

11:33.562 --> 11:35.738
So I come back
and I do it again.

11:35.782 --> 11:38.175
TODD:
So I beat his ass again.

11:38.219 --> 11:40.177
And I'm whaling on this kid,

11:40.221 --> 11:41.831
and I'm going in hard,

11:41.875 --> 11:43.354
and he's just taking it.

11:43.398 --> 11:45.705
And I think
it's gonna be the end of that.

11:45.748 --> 11:47.968
RUDY JR.:
So, Percy gets suspended again.

11:48.011 --> 11:51.188
And I'm like,
"PJ, you really that sensitive?"

11:51.232 --> 11:53.538
Like, "What the fuck
are you doing this for, man?"

11:53.582 --> 11:54.670
ORGANIZM:
So, uh,

11:54.714 --> 11:56.019
after the first suspension,

11:56.063 --> 11:58.021
I went from Diamond V
to Masters.

11:58.065 --> 12:00.545
But when I went back to school,

12:00.589 --> 12:02.156
I felt my, my skills fading,

12:02.199 --> 12:04.593
so I had to do
another milk bomb.

12:04.636 --> 12:07.378
TODD: It just became this thing.
Randomly throughout the day,

12:07.422 --> 12:09.729
he would smack a bag of milk
on my head.

12:09.772 --> 12:11.208
Then I'd beat his ass.

12:11.252 --> 12:12.688
[chuckles]:
He was covered in milk.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.385
You know, he's full milk.

12:14.429 --> 12:16.823
And even though
he's beating my ass,

12:16.866 --> 12:18.128
he's covered in milk, so...

12:18.172 --> 12:20.391
RUDY JR.:
The more time he spent at home,

12:20.435 --> 12:22.263
the more time
he could playLeague,

12:22.306 --> 12:26.484
so these suspensions,
they were not punishment to him.

12:26.528 --> 12:27.834
I begged him to stop.

12:27.877 --> 12:30.314
I said, "Please, son,
I'm missing a lot of work

12:30.358 --> 12:32.969
coming to pick you up
and stay home."

12:33.013 --> 12:34.623
I guess that was
the first time I realized

12:34.666 --> 12:39.454
that sometimes I do take things
a little too far, so...

12:39.497 --> 12:40.890
I apologized.

12:40.934 --> 12:42.805
TODD:
Here's the thing.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.198
Anytime I would beat him up,

12:44.241 --> 12:46.069
he would have this look
in his eyes.

12:46.113 --> 12:48.811
I don't even know
how to explain it.

12:48.855 --> 12:51.335
This kid,
he's wired differently.

12:51.379 --> 12:53.642
RUDY JR.: The fact that he would
get his revenge

12:53.685 --> 12:54.904
over and over on this kid

12:54.948 --> 12:57.298
and then spend
his suspension time

12:57.341 --> 12:59.430
getting better at League,
like, looking back,

12:59.474 --> 13:01.476
that's-that's
when we should have known

13:01.519 --> 13:05.523
that this kid would stop
at nothing to become the best.

13:07.351 --> 13:08.962
EMMA:
No one works harder than Org,

13:09.005 --> 13:10.702
and that is why he beats you.

13:10.746 --> 13:12.966
KYLE: That's what makes him
the player he is.

13:13.009 --> 13:14.663
You know,
he always wants another one

13:14.706 --> 13:16.099
and another one and another one.

13:16.143 --> 13:18.710
I have to pull him away
from his rig sometimes

13:18.754 --> 13:20.625
because he pushes this team.

13:20.669 --> 13:21.844
He never stops.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.063
NIGHTFALL:
Korea and China

13:23.106 --> 13:24.760
do so much better at Worlds

13:24.804 --> 13:26.806
because they just practice
so much harder than us.

13:26.849 --> 13:29.286
But they don't practice more
than Organizm.

13:29.330 --> 13:30.984
Nobody does.

13:31.027 --> 13:32.550
RUDY JR.: I used to be
a college basketball player,

13:32.594 --> 13:35.292
right?
So I get high-level athletics.

13:35.336 --> 13:37.860
And in basketball
or any other traditional sport,

13:37.904 --> 13:40.254
rest is a key part
of your training.

13:40.297 --> 13:42.082
Any sports scientist
will tell you

13:42.125 --> 13:43.518
that if you start training

13:43.561 --> 13:44.867
for more than, like,
six hours a day,

13:44.911 --> 13:46.477
that shit actually hurts you.

13:46.521 --> 13:49.524
But there is no
physical limitation to gaming,

13:49.567 --> 13:51.091
so the best players,
they just compete

13:51.134 --> 13:53.876
for 14, 15, 16 hours a day.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.878
And PJ...

13:55.922 --> 13:57.880
he's a fucking machine.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.447
ANNOUNCER:
The one, the only,

13:59.490 --> 14:02.580
of course it's Organizm
cleaning up the fight

14:02.624 --> 14:06.149
and claiming another win
for Fugitive.

14:06.193 --> 14:07.847
I know people think
that I'm weird

14:07.890 --> 14:10.066
or that I'm intense.

14:11.285 --> 14:13.069
But that's just because
they're playing the game.

14:15.767 --> 14:16.943
I don't think it's a game.

14:16.986 --> 14:19.032
Fuck!

14:19.075 --> 14:21.556
It's not a game to me.

14:29.346 --> 14:31.174
[siren wailing in distance]

14:31.218 --> 14:33.176
CREAMCHEESE: The water tastes
straight up different here.

14:33.220 --> 14:34.569
Tastes like Crystal
compared to L.A.

14:34.612 --> 14:36.397
KYLE: Yeah, it's a lot better
than L.A.

14:36.440 --> 14:37.659
-CREAMCHEESE: Look at that.
-KYLE: It's the filtration.

14:37.702 --> 14:39.182
Hey, hey, Org. Hey.

14:39.226 --> 14:40.749
It's all right.
It's all right. Come on.

14:40.792 --> 14:43.447
-It's like 8:00 p.m., dude.
-ORGANIZM: I know, man.

14:43.491 --> 14:45.580
They keep trying to get me
to do this promo shit,

14:45.623 --> 14:46.798
and I don't want to do it.

14:46.842 --> 14:48.017
-Can we start?
-KYLE: Uh, it is

14:48.061 --> 14:50.977
15 minutes till the next block.

14:51.020 --> 14:54.154
[groans]
God, man.

14:54.197 --> 14:55.938
APRIL:
It's a really tough situation.

14:55.982 --> 14:57.287
You know, it's the semifinals.

14:57.331 --> 15:00.160
We're in Philly,
and Org's being pulled

15:00.203 --> 15:02.553
into all kinds
of different directions.

15:02.597 --> 15:05.078
-Come on, pop that queue.
-APRIL: Of course we want Org

15:05.121 --> 15:07.776
to do promotions
and put his face out there,

15:07.819 --> 15:09.996
but none of it means anything
if we don't win.

15:10.039 --> 15:11.954
KYLE: All right.
Good work, everybody.

15:11.998 --> 15:13.564
ORGANIZM:
Let's go again.

15:13.608 --> 15:15.131
Again?

15:15.175 --> 15:17.046
-Again.
-Bro, that...

15:17.090 --> 15:19.440
No.
We've been scrimming all day.

15:19.483 --> 15:23.009
KYLE:
Okay, good stuff, good stuff.

15:23.052 --> 15:24.140
-I'm gonna go.
-ORGANIZM: Guys-guys,

15:24.184 --> 15:25.489
can we play one more, please?

15:25.533 --> 15:27.752
NIGHTFALL:
No, bro, we haven't ate yet.

15:27.796 --> 15:29.667
We haven't eaten. I think, guys,

15:29.711 --> 15:31.582
let's get some food, get
some rest. I think, everyone,

15:31.626 --> 15:33.584
-you did great work today.
-Yes.

15:33.628 --> 15:35.325
ORGANIZM: Cream, Cream, wait,
wait, wait. Uh, can we, uh,

15:35.369 --> 15:37.371
can we, please, get, like,
one duo queue in, please?

15:37.414 --> 15:39.199
-Man, I need... Please...
-Bro, you haven't eaten.

15:39.242 --> 15:40.852
We got to eat.

15:40.896 --> 15:42.724
-I just want to get one more...
-Take me to one of your favorite

15:42.767 --> 15:45.292
spots in Philly. What's your
favorite restaurant in Philly?

15:47.120 --> 15:48.730
[arcade sounds]

15:51.646 --> 15:55.084
-Mmm.
-[chuckles]: That's good, right?

15:55.128 --> 15:57.260
-Good?
-That hits so hard.

15:57.304 --> 15:58.827
-I have been sleeping on these.
-You have.

15:58.870 --> 16:00.133
These are so fucking good.

16:00.176 --> 16:01.961
-They're amazing.
-What the fuck?

16:02.004 --> 16:04.354
I feel like the food
at Dave & Buster's is...

16:04.398 --> 16:06.226
so much better
than people realize.

16:06.269 --> 16:09.055
Like, people come here
for the games.

16:09.098 --> 16:10.447
It's like a restaurant.

16:10.491 --> 16:12.623
-It is fully a restaurant.
-It is. Yeah.

16:12.667 --> 16:13.929
And a good one.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.104
ORGANIZM: Sometimes
the pressure

16:15.148 --> 16:17.019
just gets too crazy for me,

16:17.063 --> 16:19.282
and sometimes I just need
something to clear my head,

16:19.326 --> 16:21.502
and Dave & Buster's
does that for me.

16:21.545 --> 16:23.634
What's Rudy got you doing next?

16:23.678 --> 16:26.028
Some sponsorship.

16:26.072 --> 16:28.117
-Sponsorship?
-Yeah.

16:29.901 --> 16:32.034
Sounds lame, honestly.

16:32.078 --> 16:34.428
I'm so sick of this shit, man.

16:34.471 --> 16:37.083
I told you about
how we started Fugitive?

16:37.126 --> 16:38.475
Yeah, you did.

16:38.519 --> 16:40.129
-You told me that story a lot.
-Yeah.

16:40.173 --> 16:42.610
And this is even before
we were Challenger.

16:42.653 --> 16:44.481
And I needed my keyboard,
but they wouldn't

16:44.525 --> 16:46.657
-give it back to me.
-Yeah, I heard-- I know this.

16:46.701 --> 16:48.137
-You heard it. I know, I know.
-Yeah, you told me.

16:48.181 --> 16:49.878
I know.

16:49.921 --> 16:51.619
Say no more.

16:51.662 --> 16:53.751
I feel like, when people
hear this story, they're like,

16:53.795 --> 16:56.493
"Oh, Cream, you're such
a badass," but, like,

16:56.537 --> 16:59.496
um, that's not the point of
the story, you know what I mean?

16:59.540 --> 17:01.020
Like, the point of the story
isn't that I'm a badass,

17:01.063 --> 17:03.500
it's like, that shit
with my family,

17:03.544 --> 17:05.937
like h-how they treat me,
all that shit,

17:05.981 --> 17:07.374
I don't let it stop me.

17:07.417 --> 17:09.680
Like, if anything,
I let it fuel me.

17:09.724 --> 17:12.205
You-you have to fight
for yourself

17:12.248 --> 17:13.510
because we need you.

17:13.554 --> 17:16.339
We need you right now.
For this week.

17:16.383 --> 17:17.688
-Yeah.
-It's not Puma,

17:17.732 --> 17:20.648
not the family shit,
but-but Fugitive.

17:20.691 --> 17:22.606
You're as big of a part
of this team as me.

17:22.650 --> 17:24.608
And, like,
I know you would steal

17:24.652 --> 17:29.352
your keyboard from your parents
if that was relevant.

17:29.396 --> 17:32.747
-Thank you.
-Yeah. I-I mean that.

17:37.795 --> 17:39.319
-It's easy.
-That finger trap's

17:39.362 --> 17:40.929
like a metaphor, dude,

17:40.972 --> 17:43.540
because that's like the way--
that's like your family.

17:45.586 --> 17:47.762
There's a metaphor in there,
for sure.

17:50.939 --> 17:53.463
And this, this hand's,
like, a metaphor for, like,

17:53.507 --> 17:56.379
how I, how I'm gonna slap
your bitch ass, you know?

17:56.423 --> 17:59.556
-What is that even?
-[both laugh]

18:05.606 --> 18:06.955
KOBE: Welcome to Philadelphia
for the LCS semifinal

18:06.998 --> 18:08.739
between Cloud9 and--

18:08.783 --> 18:10.654
who would have guessed it--
Fugitive Gaming.

18:10.698 --> 18:13.266
-[chanting]: Fugitive! Fugitive!
-[cheering]

18:13.309 --> 18:15.398
Fugitive! Fugitive!

18:15.442 --> 18:17.226
PHREAK: And, Kobe, first things
first, I'm thinking about

18:17.270 --> 18:20.142
the Fugitive Gaming bot-lane.

18:21.535 --> 18:24.146
We saw in quarters, they
actually worked well together...

18:24.190 --> 18:26.148
-It's about time, Phreak.
-I know!

18:26.192 --> 18:27.671
What a time to come alive.

18:29.369 --> 18:30.848
KOBE:
Creamcheese will be trying

18:30.892 --> 18:33.155
to prove that he can win
on the biggest stage,

18:33.199 --> 18:35.244
that he won't melt down
under pressure,

18:35.288 --> 18:37.246
but still, the fate of Fugitive

18:37.290 --> 18:40.597
hangs largely on the shoulders
of their 17-year-old rookie.

18:40.641 --> 18:42.817
PHREAK: That's right. He's made
semis his rookie split.

18:42.860 --> 18:45.254
He's got a home crowd behind
him, like, this is his time.

18:45.298 --> 18:46.951
RUDY JR.: Hey, so y'all get

18:46.995 --> 18:48.692
a little bit more
how the game works?

18:48.736 --> 18:53.175
Just look for FUG Organizm.
That's Percy.

18:53.219 --> 18:54.829
I paid $12 for a hot dog,
did you know that?

18:54.872 --> 18:56.526
And it's gonna be worth
every penny.

18:56.570 --> 18:58.180
And the hot dog
wasn't even good, man.

18:58.224 --> 18:59.921
-Already?
-No, it wasn't good.

18:59.964 --> 19:03.229
KOBE: Some people will
thrive off this energy,

19:03.272 --> 19:04.839
some will crumble under it,

19:04.882 --> 19:07.015
and today we find out
which one Organizm is.

19:07.058 --> 19:09.670
Let's win this.

19:10.975 --> 19:12.934
GABRIELLA:
Cloud9 came into the series

19:12.977 --> 19:15.371
with the best regular
season record in the LCS.

19:15.415 --> 19:17.678
A team with aspirations
at Worlds.

19:17.721 --> 19:20.420
But Fugitive clearly had
the talent to compete.

19:20.463 --> 19:22.161
PHREAK:
Heading into the bot-lane.

19:22.204 --> 19:23.771
When's it gonna happen?
Here we go.

19:23.814 --> 19:25.338
Got to find the first knock
from Creamcheese.

19:25.381 --> 19:27.166
-They're gonna get a kill.
-[cheering]

19:27.209 --> 19:29.516
First blood comes through
for Nightfall.

19:30.865 --> 19:33.520
APRIL: But Creamcheese
was indecisive all day.

19:33.563 --> 19:36.305
And I think that indecisiveness
was the story

19:36.349 --> 19:38.742
of those first four games.

19:40.701 --> 19:42.485
TYRANT:
Okay, can I get on top?

19:42.529 --> 19:44.313
KOBE: Fugitive is sitting there
5v4 in mid.

19:44.357 --> 19:45.836
There's no engagements,
no push.

19:45.880 --> 19:48.752
They're just giving up
the uncontested dragon.

19:54.715 --> 19:55.977
Goddamn it.

19:56.020 --> 19:57.674
JATT:
Cream has a reputation

19:57.718 --> 19:59.850
for choking in big games.

19:59.894 --> 20:01.852
-Oh, my goodness.
-Fair or not,

20:01.896 --> 20:04.028
that's not exactly
what you want to hear

20:04.072 --> 20:05.769
about your leader
and shot caller.

20:05.813 --> 20:08.032
PHREAK: Creamcheese looks,
but he's engaging too early.

20:08.076 --> 20:09.686
-KOBE: Ooh!
-We got his screen right now.

20:09.730 --> 20:11.340
PHREAK: He's gonna get deleted,

20:11.384 --> 20:13.908
and you don't win 4v5s
at this point.

20:16.084 --> 20:19.261
PHREAK: Cloud9 take game three
and a two-to-one lead.

20:19.305 --> 20:21.698
KOBE: They're just one game
away from finals.

20:21.742 --> 20:23.744
-They can almost touch it.
-RUDY JR.: Terrible engage!

20:23.787 --> 20:27.356
Never should have taken
that fight. What are you doing?

20:28.705 --> 20:30.577
KYLE:
It was an off day for Cream...

20:31.578 --> 20:32.970
...and the way we were playing,

20:33.014 --> 20:36.060
I think we all felt lucky
that we avoided a sweep.

20:36.104 --> 20:38.541
PHREAK: The dim light at the end
of the tunnel is named Ezreal.

20:38.585 --> 20:42.893
Organizm, Arcane Shift for it--
he's gonna knock out Renekton.

20:42.937 --> 20:44.547
No, no. He's gonna--

20:44.591 --> 20:46.027
-You're kidding me!
-KOBE: Oh!

20:46.070 --> 20:48.421
PHREAK:
What? He's a telepath, Kobe!

20:48.464 --> 20:51.162
They have fought
and scraped and clawed

20:51.206 --> 20:53.077
and got a little bit lucky,

20:53.121 --> 20:54.949
but they're gonna
take down the Nexus.

20:59.606 --> 21:01.564
PHREAK:
Queue up the "Silver Scrapes."

21:01.608 --> 21:03.305
It all comes down to this.

Fugitive! Fugitive! Let's go!

who goes to the LCS finals

21:31.986 --> 21:33.640
and who goes home.

21:33.683 --> 21:36.033
KOBE: Cloud9 are already off
to a 2,000 gold lead,

21:36.077 --> 21:38.775
and Fugitive,
they just look lost.

21:38.819 --> 21:41.691
They're not making
any proactive plays.

CREAMCHEESE:
Every time I called a shot,

21:43.650 --> 21:45.782
Cloud9 had an answer.

pay with his life

21:55.575 --> 21:57.925
for that terrible ward timing.

21:57.968 --> 22:00.971
KOBE: I hate to say it, but
it's become a familiar sight,

22:01.015 --> 22:03.974
Creamcheese not performing
on the big stage again.

22:04.018 --> 22:06.760
CREAMCHEESE:
And then...

22:06.803 --> 22:08.631
Organizm saw something I didn't.

-Okay, push mid, push mid.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.678
We can sneak Baron.

KYLE: Watching the game,
I'm listening to the comms,

22:25.735 --> 22:28.869
and I hear Cream
wants to push mid.

22:29.609 --> 22:31.480
Org says no,

22:31.524 --> 22:34.396

of a stalemate right now,

22:36.224 --> 22:37.660

were starting
to mesh a little bit more,

this kind of family wavelength

how this is a-a big moment
for Organizm, and it is.

23:56.347 --> 23:59.916
But if you ask me,
this is an incredible moment

23:59.960 --> 24:02.049
for Creamcheese's leadership.

24:04.704 --> 24:06.575
And I said to Organizm,

"Isn't it better
when we win as a team?"

24:08.838 --> 24:12.929

I know you did good.

24:55.189 --> 24:56.625

the bottom,

24:56.669 --> 24:58.105

at the top,"

-Yeah, yeah.

it was good. I liked it.

you got to get dressed quick,

25:23.478 --> 25:24.697

watch your tone.

25:32.748 --> 25:34.402
Secondly, you've been gone
for a long time.

25:34.445 --> 25:36.012
Your family wants to spend
some time with you.

25:36.056 --> 25:37.710
You can spare some time
for your family.

25:37.753 --> 25:40.582
Why?
I mean, as far as I remember,

25:40.626 --> 25:43.672
none of y'all wanted anything
to do with me or this game.

25:43.716 --> 25:47.197
I had to go to every single one
of Rudy's basketball games.

25:47.241 --> 25:51.332
-Yeah? He's family, son.
-Every single one?

25:51.375 --> 25:55.379
But it took you guys
a multimillion dollar deal.

25:55.423 --> 25:58.469
A multimillion dollar deal.

25:58.513 --> 26:01.037
And a semifinals half an hour
away from the house

26:01.081 --> 26:03.039
for y'all to finally
come see me play once.

26:03.083 --> 26:04.693
Son, this ain't the place
for this. We didn't understand.

26:04.737 --> 26:06.216
And now it's just as if

26:06.260 --> 26:08.784

some time for y'all?

'cause, look, we-we've been

now, and y'all really didn't

ORGANIZM: You used to treat me
like shit in high school, dawg.

26:27.934 --> 26:30.371
You used to call me Piss Jar.

26:32.112 --> 26:34.941
You are a D3
basketball player, dude.

26:34.984 --> 26:36.246
MAN: That's uncalled for.

26:36.290 --> 26:38.248
A D3 basketball player.

26:38.292 --> 26:40.076
I want to be the best
in the world.

26:40.120 --> 26:41.730
-The best.
-Yeah. Yeah, and you...

26:41.774 --> 26:44.254
So why the fuck would I take
advice from a loser like you?

26:44.298 --> 26:45.821
Why would you take advice?
Yeah, why?

26:45.865 --> 26:47.214
Or any of y'all
for that fucking matter?

26:47.257 --> 26:48.781
-[overlapping chatter]
-I'll tell you why, man.

26:48.824 --> 26:50.260
No, I'll tell you why,
I'll tell you why,

26:50.304 --> 26:52.872
'cause I got your best
interests at heart, dawg.

26:54.656 --> 26:56.615
I ain't never played you.

27:07.626 --> 27:09.976
He's got so much money, why
I got to pay $20 for parking?

27:10.019 --> 27:13.457
$12 for a damn hot dog.
I didn't even get no nachos!

27:13.501 --> 27:15.808
It's not always about money--
he brought it--

27:15.851 --> 27:16.852
He started the thing
with the money.

27:16.896 --> 27:17.853
What did he say?

27:17.897 --> 27:19.463
[overlapping arguing]

27:19.507 --> 27:22.031
RUDY:
I paid for my own hot dog.
