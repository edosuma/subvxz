WEBVTT

01:02.708 --> 01:04.041
On final approach, Governor.

01:58.416 --> 02:01.875
I am Tawni Ames, Governor of Desix.

02:01.875 --> 02:03.875
State your business here.

02:04.541 --> 02:08.333
I am here to relieve you
of your title, Mistress Ames,

02:08.333 --> 02:10.333
by order of the Galactic Empire.

02:11.416 --> 02:14.333
As I have told your government,

02:14.333 --> 02:18.000
Desix does not fall
under Imperial jurisdiction.

02:18.708 --> 02:22.500
Take your forces and leave peacefully.

02:22.500 --> 02:27.750
Well, your request has been received,
reviewed and, as you can see, rejected.

02:28.833 --> 02:30.916
How disappointing.

02:41.708 --> 02:44.833
I have a message for your Empire.

03:18.500 --> 03:21.916
I heard the Defense Recruitment Bill is up
for a vote again.

03:22.541 --> 03:25.791
Well, let's hope it doesn't pass,
for our sake.

03:37.625 --> 03:44.291
<i>CT-9904, report to
Vice Admiral Rampart's office immediately.</i>

03:53.041 --> 03:55.375
CT-9904.

03:56.250 --> 03:57.250
Congratulations.

03:57.250 --> 03:59.791
You've been medically cleared
for active duty.

03:59.791 --> 04:02.333
Remind me. How long were you left stranded

04:02.333 --> 04:04.666
on that Kaminoan platform
before being recovered?

04:05.958 --> 04:08.083
32 rotations.

04:08.083 --> 04:10.541
Hmm. All that time.

04:11.208 --> 04:13.291
Left for dead and yet you still came back.

04:13.291 --> 04:14.958
Why?

04:16.041 --> 04:18.666
I'm a soldier of the Empire.

04:19.291 --> 04:20.416
I see.

04:20.416 --> 04:23.083
Your loyalty and determination
are commendable.

04:23.750 --> 04:27.000
Which is why I have a mission for you
on the planet Desix.

04:27.625 --> 04:31.250
As far as Separatist worlds are concerned,
it's rather remote.

04:31.250 --> 04:34.791
I normally wouldn't pay it any mind,
but an issue has arisen.

04:35.291 --> 04:36.875
What are my orders?

04:37.500 --> 04:40.833
The newly appointed Imperial governor
has been taken hostage

04:40.833 --> 04:45.833
by insurgents demanding Desix
be recognized as an independent planet.

04:47.125 --> 04:49.833
But we do not negotiate.

04:50.791 --> 04:54.958
You're being sent in under the guise
of discussing a diplomatic resolution.

04:55.916 --> 04:59.541
Once you arrive, do whatever is necessary

04:59.541 --> 05:03.125
to secure the city
and ensure Governor Grotton's release.

05:03.791 --> 05:05.708
What squad will I be leading?

05:05.708 --> 05:07.750
Oh.

05:07.750 --> 05:10.041
You're not ready to play commander again.

05:10.666 --> 05:11.791
Not yet.

05:11.791 --> 05:14.250
Your new commander will brief you
on the details.

05:15.250 --> 05:17.541
Report to the Battle Memorial
at 0900 hours.

05:21.500 --> 05:22.500
You're dismissed.

05:45.208 --> 05:46.708
Crosshair.

05:53.625 --> 05:56.250
It's been a while. Good to see ya.

05:56.250 --> 06:00.541
Commander Cody? I didn't recognize you.

06:01.250 --> 06:04.916
Yeah. A lot's changed, as you well know.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.291
When I heard you were cleared for duty,
I requested you specifically.

06:10.291 --> 06:12.416
You're lucky I was available.

06:12.916 --> 06:15.791
Word is,

06:15.791 --> 06:20.875
the rest of Clone Force 99 went rogue
after Order 66 came through.

06:21.458 --> 06:22.666
Surprised?

06:22.666 --> 06:26.708
Not really.
Your squad was different by design.

06:27.625 --> 06:29.458
Regs have gone AWOL too.

06:30.041 --> 06:31.416
So I've heard.

06:31.416 --> 06:35.458
Rumors are, more and more clones
have been questioning the Order.

06:37.500 --> 06:41.375
Then they are traitors, like the Jedi.

06:45.500 --> 06:48.416
Well, good soldiers follow orders.

06:49.291 --> 06:50.458
Mm-hmm.

07:00.500 --> 07:03.500
Intel is limited, but here's what we know:

07:03.500 --> 07:07.541
Separatist insurgents,
armed with a battalion of battle droids,

07:07.541 --> 07:11.291
have seized the city
and taken Governor Grotton hostage.

07:11.291 --> 07:14.583
Battle droids?
Didn't they receive the shutdown order?

07:14.583 --> 07:16.750
They could have been reprogrammed.

07:17.291 --> 07:19.708
The insurgents are expecting
a diplomatic envoy.

07:20.291 --> 07:22.833
We catch them by surprise,
wipe out their droids,

07:23.333 --> 07:24.750
and locate Governor Grotton.

07:25.250 --> 07:27.041
Sounds easy enough.

07:35.208 --> 07:37.291
This is Imperial Shuttle 995.

07:37.875 --> 07:40.208
Requesting permission
to enter Desix airspace.

07:40.958 --> 07:44.000
<i>Granted.
You are cleared for approach.</i>

07:47.833 --> 07:49.750
Release me this instant!

07:49.750 --> 07:52.958
Negative. The Governor said
to keep a close eye on you.

07:52.958 --> 07:56.500
I am the legitimate governor
of Desix, you scrap heap!

07:56.500 --> 07:58.166
Mm-hmm.

07:58.166 --> 08:01.458
You'll have your freedom
once we have ours.

08:01.458 --> 08:04.958
The Empire will never agree
to your terms.

08:04.958 --> 08:08.250
Precisely why I know
that "diplomatic envoy" they're sending

08:08.250 --> 08:11.125
is anything but peaceful.

08:12.875 --> 08:15.083
Dooku was right in the end.

08:15.583 --> 08:18.166
He knew the Republic was corrupt,

08:18.166 --> 08:22.250
that it would collapse
and become something worse.

08:22.750 --> 08:27.208
He saw it coming. The Galactic Empire.

08:27.208 --> 08:31.291
You lost that war.
You will lose this as well.

08:50.041 --> 08:52.958
Governor.
The Imperial shuttle is within range.

08:53.708 --> 08:56.208
Let's welcome them, shall we?

08:56.791 --> 08:57.916
<i>Affirmative.</i>

08:59.250 --> 09:02.416
It looks like they've chosen
not to negotiate.

09:03.875 --> 09:04.958
How unfortunate...

09:06.833 --> 09:08.041
for you.

09:21.625 --> 09:23.958
Air strike team, move into position.

09:40.958 --> 09:42.208
We've been hit!

09:48.958 --> 09:50.125
Fire!

09:59.000 --> 10:00.291
Nice shot!

10:05.291 --> 10:09.208
The Imperial vessel has been neutralized
and crashed in Sector Five.

10:11.791 --> 10:14.916
Send scouts to the wreck.
Check for any survivors.

10:15.541 --> 10:16.541
Yes, Governor.

10:37.791 --> 10:39.541
That doesn't look good.

10:39.541 --> 10:41.041
Yeah. For them.

10:41.625 --> 10:44.666
We found the shuttle.
There are no survivors.

10:44.666 --> 10:47.083
<i>Confirmed. Return to the city.</i>

10:47.083 --> 10:48.166
Roger, roger.

10:58.625 --> 11:01.708
That buys us time, but not much.

11:02.208 --> 11:05.291
Without a ship,
we'll have to infiltrate the city on foot.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.541
Half the squad's too injured to continue.

11:10.083 --> 11:12.166
I've beaten clankers with far less.

11:18.750 --> 11:20.333
First things first.

11:27.083 --> 11:29.208
There's not enough cover.

11:29.708 --> 11:32.208
Any direction we come at that tank,
they'll pick us off.

11:32.208 --> 11:35.000
These tanks
all have the same weakness.

11:35.916 --> 11:37.500
The droids operating them.

11:38.500 --> 11:41.750
I'll draw their fire
while you move into position.

11:43.250 --> 11:44.500
Trust me.

11:45.458 --> 11:47.625
You do make things interesting.

12:01.708 --> 12:03.708
Where did that come from?

12:06.291 --> 12:08.458
It's there. Turn to 350.

13:27.791 --> 13:31.250
Direct shot down the barrel. Nice touch.

13:31.250 --> 13:33.208
They're moving in coordinated waves.

13:33.208 --> 13:35.791
There has to be
a tactical droid giving them orders.

13:36.291 --> 13:38.041
Then let's divide their forces.

13:38.625 --> 13:41.791
Wyler, Nova, you're with us.
We'll take the north access.

13:41.791 --> 13:43.166
Team two, take the south.

13:46.791 --> 13:48.333
They've breached our perimeter.

13:48.333 --> 13:51.916
They've split their assault.
Recommend protocol four.

13:51.916 --> 13:54.375
See it done. I'll secure Grotton.

14:16.291 --> 14:19.541
It's okay. We're here to help.

14:25.583 --> 14:27.041
Do you hear that?

14:28.208 --> 14:29.333
Droidekas.

14:42.250 --> 14:44.166
Hit him with a popper.

15:34.875 --> 15:36.250
Find that tac droid yet?

15:41.125 --> 15:44.208
It's in the bell tower,
but I can't get a clear line of sight.

15:44.208 --> 15:46.166
Well, let's remedy that.

15:53.833 --> 15:55.166
Oh.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.458
Nova!

16:49.583 --> 16:50.833
Secure the tower.

17:08.583 --> 17:09.666
Any ideas?

17:09.666 --> 17:11.583
Just try and keep up.

17:47.041 --> 17:49.166
Cody! Cody!

17:57.250 --> 17:59.750
Hold tight. I'll take out the tac droid.

17:59.750 --> 18:02.250
I can make the shot from here.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.333
Give me a line of sight.

18:16.458 --> 18:18.541
- Where do you need the puck?
- Throw it.

18:18.541 --> 18:19.625
How far?

18:20.166 --> 18:21.666
As far as you can.

18:24.875 --> 18:27.000
Defend the governor at all costs.

18:47.291 --> 18:49.125
<i>We need more reinforcements</i>.

18:49.833 --> 18:52.541
Commander?

18:54.875 --> 18:57.791
Nice throw.

18:58.375 --> 18:59.416
Nice shot.

19:05.791 --> 19:08.291
<i>Sir, the droid forces have been defeated.</i>

19:08.291 --> 19:10.791
Scour the city. Find Governor Grotton.

19:10.791 --> 19:12.375
There's no need.

19:13.791 --> 19:16.291
Do something!

19:17.208 --> 19:20.666
I'm Tawni Ames. The rightful governor.

19:20.666 --> 19:23.333
We have official Imperial orders.

19:23.333 --> 19:26.708
Desix separated from the Republic
years ago, Commander.

19:26.708 --> 19:28.541
We are an independent system.

19:29.541 --> 19:31.666
Once your government acknowledges this,

19:31.666 --> 19:34.708
Grotton and his soldiers
will be handed over.

19:36.083 --> 19:37.833
Those are my terms.

19:37.833 --> 19:40.000
We're not here
to debate politics with you.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.458
If you did,
you might see how unjust your actions are.

19:44.458 --> 19:47.625
Your droid army attacked
two Imperial convoys.

19:47.625 --> 19:51.500
We were defending ourselves
from a hostile occupation.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.166
Your forces are the only threat
to my people.

19:55.750 --> 19:57.666
We are not the enemy.

19:58.208 --> 20:02.375
The Empire seeks to establish
peace and order throughout the galaxy.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.333
Peace?

20:04.833 --> 20:07.583
There was a time I believed in that.

20:08.083 --> 20:11.916
So much so, my colleague
Mina Bonteri and I put forth a treaty

20:11.916 --> 20:14.791
with Separatist
and Republic senators alike

20:14.791 --> 20:16.333
to end the war.

20:17.708 --> 20:20.541
Your Supreme Chancellor rejected it.

20:22.041 --> 20:27.208
I realized then,
peace was never an option.

20:39.833 --> 20:41.541
It's an option now.

20:46.750 --> 20:50.583
Listen, we both lived through one war.

20:51.125 --> 20:53.083
Let's not start another.

20:53.958 --> 20:55.750
Too many people have died already.

20:56.791 --> 21:00.083
We can resolve this
without more bloodshed.

21:04.416 --> 21:08.500
Please, do this for your people.

21:20.791 --> 21:23.458
Nicely handled. Now execute her.

21:23.458 --> 21:26.125
Sir, I promised a peaceful--

21:26.125 --> 21:29.791
You did. I didn't. Now execute her!

21:37.000 --> 21:38.708
So much for peace.

21:42.208 --> 21:44.041
I gave you an order.

21:44.041 --> 21:46.625
Follow it,
or face the consequences for diso--

22:01.416 --> 22:04.666
Put her body in the square.

22:04.666 --> 22:06.791
Let it be a warning to the rest of them.

24:19.250 --> 24:21.791
Tell me something, Crosshair.

24:23.083 --> 24:25.583
This new Empire...

24:26.750 --> 24:28.875
Are we making the galaxy better?

24:29.625 --> 24:33.041
We're soldiers.
We do what needs to be done.

24:34.500 --> 24:37.541
Well, you know what makes us different
from battle droids?

24:39.208 --> 24:42.750
We make our own decisions.
Our own choices.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.541
And we have to live with them too.

25:38.583 --> 25:44.291
<i>CT-9904,
report to Vice Admiral Rampart's office.</i>

25:54.583 --> 25:58.166
After your success on Desix,
I'm entrusting you with another mission.

25:58.708 --> 26:01.041
Report to CC-1226.

26:01.541 --> 26:04.041
Why not Commander Cody?

26:05.208 --> 26:08.958
- Cody?
- CC-2224.

26:10.083 --> 26:14.458
Ah, yes. It appears he has gone AWOL.

26:16.666 --> 26:20.333
Clone loyalty does not seem
to be as advertised anymore.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.458
Funny, isn't it?

26:23.208 --> 26:26.708
How these clones around you
keep disappearing.

26:30.083 --> 26:31.083
Problem?

26:31.875 --> 26:34.458
No, sir.

26:35.041 --> 26:37.666
Hmm. Then you're dismissed.
