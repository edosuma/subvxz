<i>Previously on</i> The Vampire Diaries:

00:03.920 --> 00:07.822
Vampires and werewolves roam freely
till a shaman curse to limit their power.

00:07.991 --> 00:11.449
Werewolves can only turn on a full
moon, vampires are weakened by sun.

00:11.628 --> 00:14.324
Werewolf part of the curse,
it's sealed with a moonstone.

00:14.497 --> 00:16.431
He told me about your ex. Katherine?

00:16.599 --> 00:18.965
- You must be Elena.
- How do we look exactly alike?

00:19.135 --> 00:21.399
The moonstone
is what breaks the curse.

00:21.571 --> 00:23.402
Sacrifices. Blood of the doppelganger.

00:23.573 --> 00:25.165
- You're the doppelganger.
- Elijah.

00:25.341 --> 00:28.435
- One of the Originals.
- Klaus is the real deal.

00:28.611 --> 00:31.603
The oldest vampire in the history of time
is coming after me?

00:34.984 --> 00:37.009
- What's happening?
- Why are you helping me?

00:37.220 --> 00:39.916
I was alone when I turned.
I don't want that to happen.

00:40.090 --> 00:44.117
I don't want to be saved. Not if it means
Klaus is gonna kill every person I love.

00:44.294 --> 00:45.784
- Rose Marie.
- I don't wanna run.

00:45.962 --> 00:47.589
I don't have anywhere to run to.

00:47.764 --> 00:49.595
She was scared. She didn't mean to run.

00:49.766 --> 00:52.428
Yes, she did.
She's been running for 500 years.

00:54.504 --> 00:57.200
- No!
- I'll find a way to get you out.

00:57.373 --> 00:59.841
- No matter what happens, protect her.
- Promise.

01:00.009 --> 01:03.877
That right there was the biggest mistake
you've ever made.

01:29.139 --> 01:31.004
Come on. Come on.

01:32.942 --> 01:34.671
<i>It's Mason. Leave a message.</i>

01:36.780 --> 01:38.407
Mason, it's Tyler again.

01:38.581 --> 01:40.048
Look, your cell's voicemail is full.

01:40.216 --> 01:41.740
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

01:41.918 --> 01:44.045
<i>It's a full moon tomorrow...</i>

01:44.220 --> 01:47.246
<i>...and, ah, I found your recording,</i>
<i>and I'm freaking out over here.</i>

01:47.423 --> 01:48.515
<i>So just call me back.</i>

01:49.058 --> 01:51.754
- Please.
- <i>Help!</i>

02:11.047 --> 02:13.709
Now you've got this back,
what are you gonna do with it?

02:13.883 --> 02:16.511
Right now, it's what's binding
the Sun and Moon Curse.

02:16.686 --> 02:19.712
If I can figure out a way
to remove the spell from the stone...

02:19.889 --> 02:22.687
...the stone becomes useless.
- According to Katherine...

02:22.859 --> 02:25.953
...Klaus becomes vengeful.
- Maybe. If he finds out.

02:26.129 --> 02:27.323
Bonnie, can't this wait?

02:28.097 --> 02:31.225
Stefan is in the tomb with Katherine.
We've gotta get him out.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.392
- Wants me to focus on this.
- Don't listen.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.731
He thinks he's protecting me,
but he's wrong.

02:35.905 --> 02:37.099
I'm taking Stefan's side.

02:37.273 --> 02:41.004
We're not gonna let you get used
in some creepy sacrifice ritual.

02:41.177 --> 02:44.840
- What are you guys arguing about?
- Not arguing about anything.

02:54.157 --> 02:55.988
I need a coffee.

03:01.397 --> 03:03.888
- What?
- Why are you on some suicide mission?

03:04.067 --> 03:06.661
I'm trying to prevent everyone else
from getting hurt.

03:06.870 --> 03:11.000
Heh, so bringing Klaus the moonstone
so you could get yourself killed is okay?

03:30.426 --> 03:31.825
Where are you going?

03:31.995 --> 03:34.987
- Um, to see Stefan.
- You're lying.

03:35.331 --> 03:36.764
- No, I'm not.
- Really?

03:37.533 --> 03:40.161
- Tell your face.
- Are you serious?

03:40.336 --> 03:42.270
She took the moonstone.

03:42.705 --> 03:46.300
- How did you...?
- We tested you. You failed.

03:50.613 --> 03:54.777
Klaus killed Katherine's entire family
just because she crossed him.

03:56.185 --> 03:57.345
I can't let that happen.

04:13.436 --> 04:16.462
- What did you do?
- It's for the best, Elena.

04:25.448 --> 04:29.544
- You trapped her in the house?
- It's for the best. Trust me.

04:29.719 --> 04:32.552
Elena's on a martyr tear
that rivals your greatest hits.

04:32.722 --> 04:34.815
Be glad the witch and I
are getting along.

04:35.158 --> 04:37.149
I brought you this. Care package.

04:37.327 --> 04:39.522
Candles, lanterns.

04:40.997 --> 04:43.591
And lunch.

04:43.766 --> 04:46.860
Give that to me,
I'm just gonna have to share it with her.

04:49.772 --> 04:52.332
- Yeah.
- You two are calm...

04:52.508 --> 04:56.342
...considering Klaus will hunt you down
and kill you if you mess up his plan.

04:56.512 --> 04:58.173
I've been dead before. Got over it.

04:59.382 --> 05:02.783
Once we deal with this moonstone,
we'll figure a way to get you out.

05:02.986 --> 05:04.977
Ah, don't worry about me.

05:05.288 --> 05:07.722
Just make sure Elena's safe.

05:14.630 --> 05:18.088
- Heading out?
- Yeah.

05:18.267 --> 05:21.464
Lunch at the Grill, I've got practice...

05:21.637 --> 05:24.868
...then we'll probably go out after.
I'll be late.

05:28.111 --> 05:30.705
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:31.948 --> 05:34.712
Sorry, rude.
You have no idea who I am.

05:34.884 --> 05:38.411
Uh, I'm Jules.
A friend of Mason's from Florida?

05:39.055 --> 05:42.821
- You must be Tyler.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

05:43.026 --> 05:45.221
So I know it's weird of me
to just stop by...

05:45.395 --> 05:47.056
...I'm trying to track down Mason.

05:47.563 --> 05:50.623
Mason's back in Florida.
He has been for a while now.

05:51.834 --> 05:55.793
See, uh, that's the thing. He's not.

06:01.611 --> 06:04.239
So now I'm playing
historical society hostess...

06:04.414 --> 06:06.905
...to some writer
who's doing this book on Virginia.

06:07.083 --> 06:08.573
- Well, that sounds...
- Lame.

06:08.851 --> 06:11.149
Carol Lockwood
played the dead husband card...

06:11.320 --> 06:12.514
...was too busy to deal.

06:12.688 --> 06:15.816
Plus, my sister kept most
of the archives, so there you have it.

06:15.992 --> 06:17.254
Mm.

06:23.566 --> 06:25.864
- Hey.
- Hey. What's wrong?

06:27.070 --> 06:29.834
This girl Mason knows
stopped by the house.

06:30.006 --> 06:32.338
She said he never made it back
to Florida.

06:32.508 --> 06:36.911
My mom's freaking out, and she was on
the phone with your mom when I left. Uh...

06:37.480 --> 06:39.880
- We should get going.
- Yeah.

06:57.033 --> 06:58.796
You should really lock your door.

07:00.903 --> 07:03.667
Oh, come on, pouty.
Least give me two points for ingenuity.

07:04.474 --> 07:06.408
- Do you think this is funny?
- Yes, Elena.

07:06.609 --> 07:09.840
I find hilarity in the lengths that I have
to go to to repeatedly save your life.

07:11.214 --> 07:13.648
- What did Stefan say about this?
- Had a good laugh.

07:13.816 --> 07:16.876
And what did he say about Elijah
still being alive?

07:17.053 --> 07:19.851
Yeah, that.

07:20.490 --> 07:22.685
- I didn't tell him.
- Why not?

07:22.859 --> 07:25.384
Well, A, he can't do anything about it,
and B...

07:25.561 --> 07:26.653
...what I just said.

07:27.230 --> 07:29.892
Uh, where's Bonnie?

07:30.066 --> 07:32.694
- Thought she was meeting you.
- She's on moonstone duty.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.427
And I'm on Elena patrol.

07:34.637 --> 07:36.696
Who's on Tyler Lockwood
and the full moon?

07:37.540 --> 07:39.599
Vampire Barbie asked
if she could handle it.

07:39.775 --> 07:42.266
I said, "Why not?"
If she screwed up, he'd bite her.

07:42.445 --> 07:46.541
- Then I'll be rid of two of my problems.
- Hold on a second. Tonight's full moon?

07:46.716 --> 07:47.774
You're too absorbed...

07:49.152 --> 07:50.585
...with all your
suicidal tendencies to notice.

07:50.753 --> 07:53.244
- What?
- Sheriff Forbes has officially declared...

07:53.422 --> 07:55.890
...Mason Lockwood a missing person.
- What? Why?

07:56.058 --> 07:59.391
Girl from Florida showed up on
Lockwood's doorstep looking for Mason.

07:59.562 --> 08:01.086
- What girl?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

08:01.264 --> 08:03.755
- She sure got everyone in a tizzy.
- <i>That's not good.</i>

08:04.167 --> 08:07.034
- Where are you?
- I'm at the Grill.

08:07.203 --> 08:08.534
I'm on my way.

08:10.239 --> 08:12.036
Change of plans. You babysit.

08:12.575 --> 08:15.772
Hey, you know,
you should get out, enjoy the sun.

08:16.078 --> 08:17.602
Oh, wait. You can't.

08:39.202 --> 08:41.898
Well, maybe he just, like,
stopped to go surf somewhere.

08:42.304 --> 08:44.273
You know,
isn't that Mason's whole thing?

08:44.740 --> 08:46.503
Maybe.

08:47.076 --> 08:51.172
- Girl seemed to think he would've called.
- I'm sure he's okay.

08:51.347 --> 08:55.215
Yeah. Anyway...

08:57.220 --> 08:58.312
Let's do this.

08:59.789 --> 09:02.019
Uh, so you'll call me
as soon as you hear anything?

09:02.225 --> 09:03.590
Of course.

09:06.229 --> 09:09.756
- I didn't get to say goodbye to your son.
- He's at the Grill with friends.

09:09.932 --> 09:11.797
I'll let him know.

09:13.135 --> 09:17.299
Jules, let's hope for the best.

09:37.760 --> 09:39.625
Hey, I'm here.

09:39.795 --> 09:41.820
No one knows where Mason is.
He's missing.

09:42.765 --> 09:44.494
You were right.

09:44.667 --> 09:47.864
Mason was lying.
There's another werewolf.

09:48.037 --> 09:49.664
His nephew.

09:59.115 --> 10:02.312
Hey, excuse me. Uh, crazy question.

10:02.485 --> 10:04.282
Do you know Tyler Lockwood?

10:04.453 --> 10:08.389
- Hmm. Mason's mystery woman.
- Yeah. Where is Mason anyway?

10:08.557 --> 10:11.082
- Decomposing in his truck.
- Let him know. Thanks.

10:11.260 --> 10:12.818
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

10:12.995 --> 10:16.453
- You think she's a werewolf?
- I hope not, being it's a full moon, Ric.

10:17.767 --> 10:20.998
- We should definitely find out.
- And what is that?

10:23.939 --> 10:24.997
Wolfsbane.

10:38.821 --> 10:40.311
Tell me you brought the manual.

10:40.489 --> 10:42.787
- Tell me you brought the wolfsbane.
- Yes.

10:43.526 --> 10:47.223
Um, not an easy herb to find.

10:49.832 --> 10:51.732
This is it.

11:01.677 --> 11:04.441
I got water bottles in my bag.
We can mix it in there.

11:05.815 --> 11:07.373
Okay.

11:12.355 --> 11:15.791
Guy at the hardware store said this
setup was rated up to 5000 pounds.

11:17.460 --> 11:19.257
Is that more
than a werewolf can pull?

11:19.528 --> 11:20.790
I have no idea.

11:24.266 --> 11:25.756
Hey, Tyler...

11:26.402 --> 11:27.994
...how you doing?

11:28.304 --> 11:29.362
Still human.

11:37.279 --> 11:39.873
Oh, my God.
You're not gonna get naked, are you?

11:40.483 --> 11:41.916
It's elastic.

11:43.819 --> 11:45.719
What should I wear?

11:45.888 --> 11:49.187
I don't think it's like the Hulk
where I get to keep my pants.

12:00.903 --> 12:02.234
Hi.

12:06.242 --> 12:10.679
I don't know what makes me upset.
That I showed you how to channel...

12:10.846 --> 12:13.872
...or that you almost killed me.
- Luka, I am so sorry.

12:14.049 --> 12:17.348
I wouldn't have done what I did
unless it was really important.

12:17.953 --> 12:20.717
- It's just that there's things that l...
- I forgive you.

12:35.771 --> 12:39.901
Wow, so much stuff.

12:40.843 --> 12:42.333
What is that?

12:43.646 --> 12:46.843
- Is this a Grimoire?
- They're all Grimoires, heh.

12:48.083 --> 12:50.244
How did you get all these?

12:50.453 --> 12:53.786
Witches all over the world have
collected their spells in Grimoires...

12:53.956 --> 12:56.948
...but over the centuries,
most of them have gotten lost...

12:57.293 --> 12:59.955
...and my dad is obsessed
with finding them...

13:00.129 --> 13:02.222
...making sure
our heritage stays intact.

13:02.398 --> 13:04.229
These can't all be your family's.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.095
Well, all witches are family.

13:06.268 --> 13:11.433
We're all bonded together
by a code of loyalty, to help each other.

13:11.774 --> 13:15.642
- That's why you've been so nice to me.
- That's one reason.

13:16.912 --> 13:18.436
Listen...

13:19.381 --> 13:22.544
...do you know how to break the bind
between a talisman and spell?

13:22.718 --> 13:24.242
Uh, well, that depends.

13:24.420 --> 13:26.980
Because spells are unique
and very specific.

13:27.790 --> 13:32.386
But, uh, I'm sure that we can figure it out.

13:38.167 --> 13:39.998
Well, hello.

13:40.169 --> 13:43.696
Can I have a Scotch and whatever
this beautiful woman is drinking?

13:43.906 --> 13:48.138
- Oh, no, one's my limit.
- Oh, come on, it's not like I'm a freak.

13:48.310 --> 13:50.608
Just being friendly
to somebody who's new.

13:50.779 --> 13:52.838
Okay, if you insist.

13:53.282 --> 13:56.115
- How do you know I'm new?
- I've never seen you here before.

13:56.285 --> 13:59.186
And I am here every night, heh.

13:59.355 --> 14:01.118
Excuse me. Is this guy bothering you?

14:01.290 --> 14:03.383
I am not bothering anybody.

14:03.559 --> 14:06.426
Perfect. Well, do it elsewhere.

14:09.298 --> 14:12.233
Don't worry. He's harmless.
He's sort of a... The town drunk.

14:12.735 --> 14:15.533
And when we get tired of him,
we just put him in a cab...

14:15.704 --> 14:18.172
...and send him to wherever he came from.
- Ha, ha.

14:18.340 --> 14:21.741
- Don't talk about me like I'm not here.
- Why are you here?

14:24.179 --> 14:25.339
Thank you for the drink.

14:35.691 --> 14:40.025
So we're fasting now? We're so pious.

14:41.063 --> 14:44.726
How long have you actually gone
without blood?

14:45.501 --> 14:52.236
I know you get desiccation in theory,
Stefan, but in reality, it's much worse.

14:52.474 --> 14:54.408
Your heart still beats...

14:54.577 --> 14:57.569
...struggling to pump
whatever blood remains.

14:57.746 --> 15:01.113
And when it's gone,
your veins rub together like sandpaper.

15:01.283 --> 15:03.080
It's excruciating.

15:06.488 --> 15:11.289
The pleasure I'll get in watching you
suffer is greater than any pain I'll feel.

15:12.194 --> 15:13.684
It's stuffy.

15:13.862 --> 15:16.524
And I've been in this dress for days.

15:16.699 --> 15:18.223
Wanna help me get out of it?

15:20.603 --> 15:22.002
Come on, Stefan.

15:23.005 --> 15:25.200
Don't be such a grump.

15:26.875 --> 15:28.900
We're here together.

15:29.645 --> 15:31.408
May as well make the best out of it.

15:36.385 --> 15:39.877
You really think Damon's gonna rush
to get you out?

15:40.289 --> 15:41.984
He's got what he wants.

15:42.157 --> 15:44.148
- Elena.
- Stop.

15:44.627 --> 15:46.094
Hey.

15:46.261 --> 15:48.786
Given what's most certainly going on
out there...

15:48.964 --> 15:52.730
...I'd say you're free
to do whatever you want in here.

15:53.435 --> 15:55.164
Nobody will ever know.

16:16.558 --> 16:17.786
Stay out of my head.

16:18.127 --> 16:20.994
Maybe I can do eternity in here
after all.

16:30.639 --> 16:31.799
Hey, what are you doing?

16:32.474 --> 16:33.805
Oh, perfect timing.

16:33.976 --> 16:35.443
Whoa. Whoa.

16:35.611 --> 16:36.942
What is this stuff?

16:37.112 --> 16:39.774
Your mom's files
from the historical society.

16:39.948 --> 16:43.076
I got roped in
to helping Mrs. Lockwood.

16:44.453 --> 16:48.116
And by roped,
I mean I'm very excited to participate.

16:49.525 --> 16:51.322
Hey. I'm Elijah.

17:00.469 --> 17:03.165
Elijah's in town doing research
on Mystic Falls.

17:04.205 --> 17:06.002
It's a pleasure.

17:09.845 --> 17:12.780
You're welcome to stay here
and rummage through this stuff.

17:12.948 --> 17:14.882
Or Elena and I could help you load it.

17:15.084 --> 17:17.608
Yeah, or I can get someone
to pick it up tomorrow.

17:17.786 --> 17:21.950
- Heh. Also a good plan.
- Thank you for inviting me, Jenna.

17:22.391 --> 17:24.119
And, Elena...

17:25.894 --> 17:28.624
...I hope to see you again
sometime soon.

17:31.700 --> 17:34.533
- Thanks for your help, Jenna.
- Anytime.

17:50.519 --> 17:51.986
- What is it?
- Um...

17:52.888 --> 17:57.552
Jenna was just asking me to get you
to help her with the boxes.

17:57.960 --> 18:00.258
Oh. Yeah.

18:06.268 --> 18:07.667
That's a wise choice.

18:09.404 --> 18:10.496
What do you want?

18:11.774 --> 18:13.935
I think it's time you and I
had a little chat.

18:16.912 --> 18:19.574
There's a B & B down the road
and a motel off l-9.

18:19.748 --> 18:22.842
- Lf you ask me, I think it's a mistake.
- No frills is fine.

18:23.018 --> 18:26.715
I'm just here for the night.
It's a long story. Looking for my friend.

18:27.055 --> 18:29.580
- Oh, who?
- Mason Lockwood.

18:29.758 --> 18:32.226
- I know Mason.
- You do?

18:32.394 --> 18:33.554
Yeah, he's a great guy.

18:34.229 --> 18:35.287
He's missing.

18:36.298 --> 18:39.597
What do you mean?
Like, I mean, "missing" missing?

18:40.369 --> 18:42.803
- How do you know Mason?
- Friends of friends.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.115
What time is it?

19:05.694 --> 19:07.491
It's almost 8.

19:09.498 --> 19:12.331
What time does the moon crest
or whatever?

19:12.501 --> 19:13.991
Not for a while.

19:14.703 --> 19:17.900
Mason's journal said
the first transformation...

19:18.073 --> 19:20.303
...can happen before the moon
hits its apex.

19:20.475 --> 19:24.434
Does it say in there how long
you'll actually be a wolf?

19:26.949 --> 19:28.314
A few hours.

19:30.519 --> 19:33.750
Maybe more, maybe less.

19:59.348 --> 20:01.612
Are you sure...?
Are you sure you wanna do that?

20:02.985 --> 20:04.282
Yeah.

20:04.820 --> 20:10.781
Mason said it will diminish my strength
so I can't break free.

20:17.566 --> 20:19.124
Tyler?

20:23.338 --> 20:26.171
Oh. Tyler?

20:26.675 --> 20:28.199
Don't!

20:28.377 --> 20:29.844
Shh.

20:30.012 --> 20:31.775
Don't! Just don't!

20:34.316 --> 20:36.079
Hey. Hey.

20:49.197 --> 20:50.391
I'm sorry.

20:55.537 --> 20:57.437
Oh, forgive the intrusion.

20:57.606 --> 20:59.403
I mean your family no harm.

20:59.908 --> 21:02.604
Why'd you kill those vampires
when they tried to take me?

21:02.811 --> 21:04.244
I didn't want you to be taken.

21:05.847 --> 21:08.042
Klaus is the most feared and hated.

21:08.216 --> 21:10.684
Those that fear him are desperate
for his approval.

21:10.852 --> 21:12.717
Word gets out
the doppelganger exists...

21:12.888 --> 21:16.517
...there'll be vampires eager to take you
to him, and I can't have that.

21:16.959 --> 21:19.052
Isn't that exactly
what you're trying to do?

21:19.227 --> 21:21.388
Let's say my goal
is not to break the curse.

21:22.464 --> 21:23.556
So, what is your goal?

21:23.732 --> 21:26.064
Klaus' obsessions
have made him paranoid.

21:26.234 --> 21:28.031
He's a recluse.

21:28.203 --> 21:30.933
- He trusts only those in his circle.
- Like you?

21:31.473 --> 21:32.963
Not anymore.

21:34.409 --> 21:36.900
You don't know where he is, do you?

21:40.082 --> 21:43.279
So you're trying to use me
to draw him out.

21:44.353 --> 21:45.820
To do that, you stay put...

21:45.988 --> 21:49.151
...stop trying to get yourself killed.
- You're telling the truth?

21:49.358 --> 21:51.758
If I wasn't truthful,
your family would be dead...

21:51.927 --> 21:54.259
...and I'd be taking you to Klaus
right now.

21:55.564 --> 21:57.555
Instead, I'm here to offer you a deal.

21:58.266 --> 21:59.358
What kind of a deal?

22:00.635 --> 22:01.727
Do nothing.

22:02.004 --> 22:03.437
Do nothing, live your life...

22:03.605 --> 22:05.095
...stop fighting.

22:05.273 --> 22:08.242
And when the time is right,
you and I shall draw Klaus out.

22:08.410 --> 22:10.469
I'll make certain
your friends remain unharmed.

22:10.779 --> 22:12.610
And then what?

22:12.948 --> 22:14.006
Then I kill him.

22:14.182 --> 22:15.774
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

22:16.985 --> 22:21.081
I'm a man of my word, Elena.
I make a deal, I keep a deal.

22:21.757 --> 22:23.520
How are you gonna
keep everybody safe?

22:23.692 --> 22:26.855
You know, I notice you have a friend,
Bonnie, is it?

22:27.029 --> 22:31.261
She seems to possess the gift of magic.
I have friends with similar gifts.

22:32.834 --> 22:33.926
You know witches.

22:34.102 --> 22:37.196
And together, we can protect everybody
that matters to you.

22:41.476 --> 22:42.807
So do we have a deal?

22:49.651 --> 22:51.846
I need you to do
one more thing for me.

22:52.020 --> 22:53.351
We're negotiating now?

23:03.165 --> 23:05.030
You know, this is good.

23:05.200 --> 23:07.293
Really good.
It's a clear view of the moon.

23:07.469 --> 23:09.198
And, uh, it's private.

23:09.371 --> 23:10.565
If anyone looks up...

23:10.739 --> 23:13.207
...they're gonna think we're insane.
- Aren't we?

23:15.577 --> 23:18.808
So, uh, what's this mysterious talisman
we're unbinding?

23:21.049 --> 23:22.710
Oh, wow, a white rock.

23:22.884 --> 23:24.317
This is fascinating.

23:24.486 --> 23:26.954
- Doesn't look like much.
- What's it spelled with?

23:29.191 --> 23:30.715
Really?

23:32.327 --> 23:34.227
Help a girl out, she still keeps secrets.

23:34.396 --> 23:37.593
- Sorry.
- I'm just teasing you.

23:47.075 --> 23:48.201
Ready?

24:38.927 --> 24:40.417
No.

24:40.595 --> 24:42.062
Hey.

24:45.167 --> 24:46.896
Tyler? Tyler.

24:51.273 --> 24:52.433
I'm burning up.

24:53.942 --> 24:55.739
It burns!

24:55.911 --> 24:58.402
I know. You just gotta breathe
through this, okay?

24:58.580 --> 24:59.808
I'll try.

25:04.252 --> 25:07.278
- You should go.
- Mm-mm.

25:07.455 --> 25:09.355
- You should leave.
- Not yet.

25:09.991 --> 25:12.186
Tyler. Tyler?

25:12.360 --> 25:13.987
- Unh!
- Tyler?

25:14.162 --> 25:15.254
Tyler!

25:30.478 --> 25:33.970
It hurts. It hurts!

25:40.455 --> 25:42.753
You know, listen,
I'm tight with the sheriff.

25:42.924 --> 25:45.290
If there's anything I can do
to help locate Mason.

25:45.460 --> 25:49.658
A great guy. After his brother's funeral,
he stuck around and...

25:49.898 --> 25:51.160
Helped his nephew and...

25:51.333 --> 25:54.268
- Tyler?
- Mason was with him the whole time.

25:54.436 --> 25:56.734
Helped him through all that grief.

25:57.606 --> 25:59.574
You haven't touched your drink.

26:00.909 --> 26:02.035
Um...

26:05.280 --> 26:07.339
Not much of a drinker.
I should get going.

26:07.549 --> 26:09.574
Oh, come on. No, look, one drink.

26:11.152 --> 26:12.346
It will help me sleep.

26:12.988 --> 26:14.649
To sleep.

26:20.195 --> 26:21.287
You fool.

26:23.632 --> 26:24.997
Think you're clever?

26:25.166 --> 26:27.691
- What do you want with Mason?
- He's my friend.

26:27.869 --> 26:30.599
I'm sorry to inform you
that you probably won't find him.

26:30.772 --> 26:32.706
- And why not?
- You should leave town.

26:32.874 --> 26:35.274
- Heh. You threatening me?
- Hmm.

26:35.577 --> 26:37.875
On a full moon. How stupid are you?

26:38.079 --> 26:41.310
- Damon, how about that second round?
- I think we're done, Ric.

26:42.284 --> 26:44.809
- You think I'm afraid of you?
- No, I don't.

26:44.986 --> 26:47.784
That's your vampire arrogance.
You should be.

26:47.956 --> 26:50.220
I sniffed you out
the moment you entered...

26:50.392 --> 26:52.326
...along with your pathetic wolfsbane.

26:53.161 --> 26:55.061
See, I've been at this a long time.

26:55.230 --> 26:57.892
And any other night,
the situation would be reversed.

26:58.099 --> 27:02.468
But tonight is not the night
to pick a fight with me.

27:02.904 --> 27:04.098
You've been marked.

27:12.213 --> 27:14.443
I wanna help,
but I don't know what to do.

27:15.817 --> 27:18.047
There's nothing you can do.

27:36.671 --> 27:38.764
Oh, God!

27:39.140 --> 27:40.505
Oh, my God.

27:40.675 --> 27:41.937
Tyler.

27:43.011 --> 27:44.376
- Get out.
- No.

27:44.546 --> 27:46.070
Get out. I don't wanna hurt you.

27:47.148 --> 27:48.240
No.

27:48.416 --> 27:49.508
No. Okay?

27:59.661 --> 28:00.855
Where is she?

28:01.029 --> 28:02.860
Just let it go, Damon.
Don't be stupid.

28:03.031 --> 28:05.226
What? I'm supposed to let her
just get away?

28:05.400 --> 28:06.799
"You've been marked"?

28:06.968 --> 28:10.631
What the hell kind of wolf
throw-down crap is that anyway?

28:10.805 --> 28:11.897
Damon, look up.

28:12.073 --> 28:13.597
Just look up.

28:14.442 --> 28:18.310
If this werewolf stuff is true,
one bite and you're dead. One bite.

28:18.480 --> 28:19.708
All right? Don't risk it.

28:19.881 --> 28:23.282
Just go home, lock your doors,
and we'll deal with it in the morning.

28:24.819 --> 28:26.309
Yeah.

28:50.712 --> 28:54.307
It's okay. You fight through it, okay?

28:54.482 --> 28:55.608
You fight.

28:57.085 --> 28:59.417
- Leave.
- No.

28:59.988 --> 29:01.250
Just go.

29:01.423 --> 29:03.323
- Please!
- No, not yet.

29:03.491 --> 29:04.753
- Just go.
- I can't.

29:05.126 --> 29:07.720
I'm staying right here.

29:08.263 --> 29:10.026
I am not going anywhere.

29:16.538 --> 29:17.664
Fight.

29:19.808 --> 29:21.435
- Fight.
- Argh!

29:50.839 --> 29:52.466
I'm sorry.

30:12.360 --> 30:13.520
I'm sorry.

31:05.947 --> 31:08.347
No, no, no! Tyler, don't...

31:49.424 --> 31:51.051
Just can't stay away, can you?

31:51.225 --> 31:54.217
- Well, you don't answer your phone.
- What do you want?

31:54.796 --> 31:57.697
- I wanted to apologize.
- Just admit it.

31:57.865 --> 32:02.632
- You don't have anywhere else to go.
- I'm sorry about Elena.

32:02.804 --> 32:05.796
I wasn't thinking straight.
I didn't know she had a death wish.

32:05.974 --> 32:08.534
But I called you.
I tried to make it right, okay?

32:08.977 --> 32:10.239
I'm sorry, Damon.

32:12.480 --> 32:15.108
And I have nowhere else to go. Heh.

32:17.986 --> 32:20.216
There's nothing here for you, Rose.

32:22.624 --> 32:24.057
Well, then.

32:39.073 --> 32:40.836
Damon!

32:54.989 --> 32:57.014
- How bad is it?
- It hurts.

33:00.428 --> 33:02.089
- It's healing.
- Oh, my God.

33:02.263 --> 33:05.164
I thought a werewolf bite was fatal.
I thought...

33:09.370 --> 33:11.099
It's not.

33:11.873 --> 33:13.033
You're gonna be okay.

33:26.587 --> 33:29.283
- Ah.
- You were successful?

33:31.626 --> 33:33.491
Course, I was.

33:33.661 --> 33:39.964
She fell for the whole show
and didn't suspect a thing.

33:55.216 --> 33:56.547
Thank you, Luka.

33:56.918 --> 33:58.715
Yeah. Whatever. I'm going to sleep.

33:58.886 --> 34:00.353
Wait.

34:01.989 --> 34:05.982
There's one more thing Elijah needs us
to do before we lose the full moon.

34:07.729 --> 34:10.322
Are we seriously not gonna talk at all?

34:10.498 --> 34:13.399
No, we can talk
about how you regret...

34:13.568 --> 34:17.060
...all you've done
to make my life miserable.

34:17.905 --> 34:20.032
What do you want me to say, Stefan?

34:20.208 --> 34:23.335
That I'm sorry
for everything that I've done?

34:23.710 --> 34:26.771
Well, I'm not, okay?
It's called self-preservation.

34:26.947 --> 34:29.178
I've been looking out for myself
for 500 years.

34:31.085 --> 34:35.579
- Wow. Look where it's gotten you.
- Yes, I've done terrible things.

34:35.757 --> 34:37.418
I know that.

34:37.958 --> 34:40.518
But I do love you, Stefan.

34:42.063 --> 34:44.725
- Even if you don't believe it.
- Want me to believe you?

34:46.266 --> 34:49.031
Show me. Do something.

34:49.203 --> 34:52.934
Prove to me
that there's something inside of you...

34:53.341 --> 34:56.708
...that's actually worth trusting.
- And then what, huh?

35:00.047 --> 35:03.744
- You're still gonna hate me.
- Well, maybe.

35:04.152 --> 35:08.054
And maybe I'll see that
there's still hope for you after all.

35:10.925 --> 35:12.051
You're playing me.

35:12.593 --> 35:13.753
Am I?

35:16.364 --> 35:18.093
You wanna find Klaus?

35:18.266 --> 35:22.259
Kill him so that you can protect
your precious Elena?

35:22.770 --> 35:25.136
- Let me guess. You know where he is.
- No, I don't.

35:26.674 --> 35:30.235
- But I could help you find him.
- For a price, I'm sure.

35:33.381 --> 35:36.873
Start with Isobel. Elena's mother.

35:37.618 --> 35:40.951
She was a research expert.
She found me.

35:45.393 --> 35:46.883
You're welcome.

36:00.541 --> 36:01.769
Elijah.

36:02.510 --> 36:04.478
Good evening, Katerina.

36:04.645 --> 36:07.773
Thank you for having the good sense
to be frightened.

36:09.717 --> 36:11.309
Your release has been requested.

36:13.487 --> 36:16.786
- What? By who?
- The lovely Elena drives a hard bargain.

36:17.058 --> 36:20.789
However, we've reached
a peaceful agreement, she and I.

36:22.363 --> 36:23.557
Please.

36:25.299 --> 36:26.527
Come.

36:26.701 --> 36:30.193
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. I've had the spell lifted.

36:47.255 --> 36:51.316
As for you, however,
you shall not exit until I say so.

36:52.193 --> 36:55.822
When Klaus comes, he'll want to know
exactly where you are.

37:00.368 --> 37:01.665
You're free to go.

37:02.336 --> 37:05.169
Elena will explain the arrangement
to you.

37:05.339 --> 37:09.070
If she keeps her word, I'll keep mine.

37:11.045 --> 37:14.845
Stefan, no. Please.
Don't let him leave me in here.

37:19.987 --> 37:21.921
Goodbye, Katherine.

38:25.453 --> 38:26.579
Tyler?

38:29.256 --> 38:31.747
- Caroline?
- Tyler.

38:34.128 --> 38:35.925
Tyler?

38:39.834 --> 38:41.597
Oh, my God.

38:41.769 --> 38:43.134
Okay.

38:45.072 --> 38:46.562
You're okay.

38:47.074 --> 38:48.336
You're okay.

38:48.542 --> 38:52.103
You made it. You didn't get out.
You're okay.

38:54.281 --> 38:56.010
No, I'm not.

39:13.467 --> 39:14.991
Elena.

39:17.438 --> 39:18.962
Hey.

39:39.293 --> 39:40.885
Hi.

39:54.375 --> 39:55.740
Talked to Caroline.

39:55.910 --> 39:58.378
She said Tyler was all locked up.

39:58.546 --> 40:03.984
So it was Jules, the other werewolf,
the one who attacked you.

40:04.151 --> 40:07.678
Yeah. I'm sorry.

40:07.855 --> 40:10.847
I picked a fight with her.
She was coming after me.

40:11.826 --> 40:13.919
All's well that ends well.

40:14.128 --> 40:17.427
- You all healed?
- Yeah.

40:18.766 --> 40:20.324
Seems that way.

40:20.501 --> 40:22.196
Rose, uh...

40:25.573 --> 40:28.337
...I'm happy that the legend was fake.

40:28.943 --> 40:31.935
Maybe werewolves made it up
to keep vampires away.

40:33.881 --> 40:35.644
Lucky me.

40:38.953 --> 40:40.352
Hmm.

40:40.955 --> 40:42.422
I'm gonna stay and help you.

40:43.424 --> 40:46.359
- Help me do what?
- Save Elena.

40:46.527 --> 40:48.188
Protect Elena, all things Elena.

40:48.729 --> 40:50.424
Really?

40:50.664 --> 40:53.030
- Why?
- Because I like you.

40:53.367 --> 40:56.859
I believe in friendship. I happen
to have a vacancy in that department...

40:57.037 --> 40:59.267
...and you can use all the friends
you can get.

41:00.407 --> 41:01.465
Just friends?

41:02.610 --> 41:04.237
Just friends.

41:13.053 --> 41:15.681
Are you're sure you can do that?

41:16.423 --> 41:20.325
I don't love men who love other women.
I think more of myself than that.

41:22.096 --> 41:24.963
But it doesn't mean
I can't be your special friend.

41:26.333 --> 41:28.824
- I think I like you.
- Ha, ha.

41:34.708 --> 41:37.006
- Ow.
- What?
