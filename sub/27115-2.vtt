- That was a great job.

09:58.734 --> 10:00.533
- Yeah, dude.
My pleasure, man.

10:00.567 --> 10:02.066
It was awesome.
It was a lot of fun, man.

10:02.100 --> 10:03.500
I'm really excited
for you guys.

10:03.533 --> 10:05.600
- Thank you so, so much.

10:05.633 --> 10:07.600
- I can't believe
you guys did all that

10:07.633 --> 10:10.333
and I didn't know anything.
Like, I love you guys so much.

10:10.367 --> 10:12.100
- Aw, we love you too.

10:12.133 --> 10:16.100
How's it feel, uh, waking up--
waking up fiancés?

10:16.133 --> 10:17.734
- I'm just like this all day.

10:21.567 --> 10:22.633
- Well, I'm going
to let you go.

10:22.667 --> 10:24.300
Love you guys.

10:24.333 --> 10:26.100
- I love you too, man.
Thanks so much again.

10:26.133 --> 10:27.600
- All right, y'all.
I'll see you later.

10:27.633 --> 10:29.033
- All right, see you,
have fun.

10:29.066 --> 10:30.633
- All right, bye.

10:30.667 --> 10:33.734
- So it's pretty cute.
They're so excited.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.266
- Yeah.

10:35.300 --> 10:37.533
- Dude, she's glowing.

10:37.567 --> 10:39.100
- I think the death of his dad

10:39.133 --> 10:41.300
really was a wake-up call
for him..

10:41.333 --> 10:43.600
Because I know what it's like
to lose a dad,

10:43.633 --> 10:46.033
you don't really
come back from that.

10:46.066 --> 10:47.700
That sh-- changes you,

10:47.734 --> 10:49.700
and I don't think any of us
are being "Jax'd."

10:49.734 --> 10:52.734
I think he has truly changed.

10:52.767 --> 10:54.633
- I just don't want that
to be the reason why

10:54.667 --> 10:56.567
he's doing
the things that he's doing.

10:56.600 --> 10:59.266
He's very much
on this dad kick right now,

10:59.300 --> 11:02.100
and he's emotional about it
because it's so recent.

11:02.133 --> 11:03.567
When that wears off--

11:03.600 --> 11:06.567
- Is he going to go back
into his old ways?

11:06.600 --> 11:09.300
I'll be real, like,
I'm ----ing cautious about it.

11:09.333 --> 11:11.133
I'm sure, in Jax's mind,

11:11.166 --> 11:12.667
he believes
he has completely changed,

11:12.700 --> 11:16.000
but it remains to be seen
if Jax is capable

11:16.033 --> 11:20.133
of making a lifelong commitment
to another person.

11:20.166 --> 11:23.266
I wish I could fast forward,
like, five years from now

11:23.300 --> 11:25.233
and see that everything
worked out okay.

11:25.266 --> 11:27.133
And then I would be able
to make a sigh of relief,

11:27.166 --> 11:31.633
and not feel so tepid about it.

11:31.667 --> 11:34.333
- Dude, your dog is horny AF.
- I know.

11:37.367 --> 11:39.233
♪ ♪

11:39.266 --> 11:41.567
Just like his dad.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.300
You're not getting laid
either, huh?

11:43.333 --> 11:45.400
Sucks.

11:45.433 --> 11:47.600
- Kirsten and I,
we're maturing.

11:47.633 --> 11:49.133
We're growing up.

11:49.166 --> 11:50.633
Like, we don't need
to go to bars, like,

11:50.667 --> 11:52.600
during the middle of the day.

11:52.633 --> 11:54.000
We drink at home.

11:54.033 --> 11:57.300
Jax is engaged.
Holy sh--.

11:57.333 --> 11:59.166
- Dude.
- Everyone is so happy.

11:59.200 --> 12:00.767
Like, this is great.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.033
I've such a ----ing
shift in him, such a shift.

12:03.066 --> 12:04.633
- It's not only
the way he treats Brittany.

12:04.667 --> 12:06.600
It's the way he treats me,
the way he treats you.

12:06.633 --> 12:09.000
- He's still a dick,
but it's just like--

12:09.033 --> 12:11.166
- He's a dick to
the people that don't matter.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.133
- No.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.200
- No.

12:15.233 --> 12:17.233
Brittany ran off crying
from her shift.

12:17.266 --> 12:19.300
Why doesn't that matter?
- I know.

12:19.333 --> 12:21.633
- And I said since the day
Brittany told me about that,

12:21.667 --> 12:24.266
I'm like "I'm coming after
this mother----er."

12:24.300 --> 12:26.633
It literally
makes my skin crawl,

12:26.667 --> 12:28.633
and it twists my tatas

12:28.667 --> 12:30.433
to see people
get away with sh--.

12:30.467 --> 12:33.667
Done.
I'm over it.

12:33.700 --> 12:35.467
- What is everyone
doing tonight?

12:35.500 --> 12:38.734
- We're going over to James
and Raquel's for dinner.

12:38.767 --> 12:42.033
- I would rather stab myself
in the eyes.

12:42.066 --> 12:44.266
- We saw them at Coachella,
but, like--

12:44.300 --> 12:48.000
- Where he was a dick again.
Did I tell you what he said?

12:48.033 --> 12:49.333
James comes up.
He starts, like,

12:49.367 --> 12:51.700
chirping and taunting my dude.

12:51.734 --> 12:53.133
- And then he goes
like this to him.

12:53.166 --> 12:54.767
And he goes,
"Oh, come on, lighten up.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.734
"We all know each other
inside and out,

12:56.767 --> 12:59.066
if you know what I mean."

12:59.100 --> 13:00.667
- Yeah, that's--
and that's when I go

13:00.700 --> 13:03.333
"you know what, you're just
a bad, sick, vile human."

13:03.367 --> 13:04.667
?

13:04.700 --> 13:06.200
- When he started coming for

13:06.233 --> 13:09.367
people that I love and
care about, like my man,

13:09.400 --> 13:12.100
I had to draw the line.

13:12.133 --> 13:14.200
It's like, fool me once,
shame on you.

13:14.233 --> 13:16.033
Fool me twice, shame on you.

13:16.066 --> 13:18.467
Fool me three times, like,
you're ----ing dead to me.

13:18.500 --> 13:20.233
I don't want he
or his girlfriend

13:20.266 --> 13:21.467
to have my name in their mouth,

13:21.500 --> 13:23.100
and especially
not my man's name,

13:23.133 --> 13:24.767
because I will go ballistic.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.300
- There's just too many people

13:26.333 --> 13:28.700
that he's done
really horrible things to,

13:28.734 --> 13:32.100
and everyone's, one by one,
coming out of the woodwork.

13:32.133 --> 13:34.767
- I went to go meet Hope.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.333
- I don't think
I've ever met her.

13:36.367 --> 13:39.200
- I've known her
four-plus years.

13:39.233 --> 13:41.500
The first time I met Hope,
we were all at a club

13:41.533 --> 13:43.400
right after
James and I broke up,

13:43.433 --> 13:46.767
and Hope and James
made out in front of me.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.467
She told me at Coachella,

13:48.500 --> 13:53.166
Raquel, James, and Hope
are all in the same house.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.533
- Raquel went to bed
because she came over to hang,

13:55.567 --> 13:58.734
James can't sleep,
and we still hook up

13:58.767 --> 14:00.166
right there when
she's asleep in the house.

14:00.200 --> 14:01.734
- Oh, my God.

14:01.767 --> 14:03.166
- Raquel's just,
like, sleeping,

14:03.200 --> 14:04.533
and they're just like,
right there?

14:04.567 --> 14:07.200
- Literally, right there.
?

14:07.233 --> 14:09.467
- No sh--.
Hope has been coming

14:09.500 --> 14:11.400
back and forth to LA
for many, many years.

14:11.433 --> 14:14.233
She and James have been, like,
banging ever--

14:14.266 --> 14:17.066
that entire time
while he's been with Raquel.

14:17.100 --> 14:19.400
- He manipulated me

14:19.433 --> 14:21.367
for almost two years.
- Yeah.

14:21.400 --> 14:24.000
- This horrible, toxic person

14:24.033 --> 14:27.000
who thinks that he's entitled
to every girl in the world.

14:27.033 --> 14:30.166
- Why is he such
a sh

14:30.200 --> 14:32.100
- Because nobody
has ever made him--

14:32.133 --> 14:34.166
- Held him accountable for it.
- Yeah.

14:34.200 --> 14:35.767
So please
come to Pride with me.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.233
- I do want to go to Pride.

14:37.266 --> 14:39.166
- I'll handle it.
- Okay.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.367
- I want to know
what you want to happen.

14:41.400 --> 14:44.300
- I want to speak for everyone
that he has silenced.

14:44.333 --> 14:46.166
- Are you thinking
about tomorrow, about Pride?

14:46.200 --> 14:47.266
- Oh, yeah.
- So you need to--

14:49.066 --> 14:51.133
I want James
to sit there and go

14:51.166 --> 14:53.300
"Oh, there's Kristen.
Wait, sh--, that's Hope."

14:53.333 --> 14:56.300
- Oh, that is scary.
- Ooh, he should be afraid.

14:56.333 --> 14:59.433
He should be very afraid.
- All right.

14:59.467 --> 15:02.100
The way that Kristen
talks about James,

15:02.133 --> 15:04.033
and taking him down.

15:04.066 --> 15:07.000
- I'm, like, sort of frothing
at the mouth a bit about this.

15:07.033 --> 15:09.166
- It's like she's
a ----ing villain

15:09.200 --> 15:11.300
in, like, a soft-core porno.

15:11.333 --> 15:14.033
"I'm going to take James down."

15:14.066 --> 15:15.467
- Oh, I already know
what I'm going to do.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.300
Because all I do is do this.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.200
I just look at him like that,
and I don't blink.

15:19.233 --> 15:21.000
- I know, you're a psycho.

15:21.033 --> 15:23.066
Okay.

15:23.100 --> 15:25.233
- Bye.
- Bye, bye.

15:25.266 --> 15:27.533
- I love you.
- I love you too.

15:27.567 --> 15:30.300
- Coming up...

15:30.333 --> 15:32.533
I could possibly
get my job back.

15:32.567 --> 15:35.333
- You don't think
that we've moved on from that?

15:35.367 --> 15:38.233
What's the upside for me?

15:44.266 --> 15:45.066
- ♪ Aim high, dream big,

16:03.367 --> 16:05.200

- Thank you, thank you again.

16:05.233 --> 16:08.133
- That car looks amazing.
- Oh, yeah, it was my father's.

16:08.166 --> 16:10.066
I had the best father
in the world.

16:10.100 --> 16:13.033
We bonded over muscle cars and
hockey and things like that.

16:13.066 --> 16:16.100
He was just the best man
that I've ever met.

16:16.133 --> 16:17.467
The most selfless,
kind human being

16:17.500 --> 16:19.233
I've ever met in my life.

16:19.266 --> 16:21.667
I can't believe I'm engaged.
- Well, nor can I.

16:21.700 --> 16:24.266
- Just out of curiosity,
how long were you engaged

16:24.300 --> 16:26.266
before you got married?

16:26.300 --> 16:28.033
- I was married
within three months,

16:28.066 --> 16:29.567
so I'm not a good example.

16:29.600 --> 16:31.200
- I thank you so much
for coming, by the way.

16:31.233 --> 16:33.100
I know I said it already
a couple times,

16:33.133 --> 16:34.633
but that meant a lot to me,
it meant a lot to Brittany.

16:34.667 --> 16:37.166
A lot of are not from here,
you know?

16:37.200 --> 16:39.100
So we consider you our family

16:39.133 --> 16:40.633
because we just don't
have family here,

16:40.667 --> 16:43.667
and--and you know, I have
less family than I did before,

16:43.700 --> 16:45.600
so it means a lot to me.

16:45.633 --> 16:49.300
My dad had esophageal cancer,
and he left me the car

16:49.333 --> 16:51.367
and a bit of money
when he passed away.

16:51.400 --> 16:54.333
And I used a good chunk of it
for Brittany's ring.

16:54.367 --> 16:57.266
So it's running a little low.

16:57.300 --> 16:59.700
Um, well, the reason
I came here is

16:59.734 --> 17:02.266
because I'd like to have
some money coming in,

17:02.300 --> 17:04.667
and I was wondering if you
need some extra help at SUR--

17:06.600 --> 17:12.100

- I love SUR.
It's my family there.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.100
It's not, like,
just a job to me.

17:21.133 --> 17:22.467

17:22.500 --> 17:25.300

I just said--listen.

You scared the sh-- out of me.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.734
I'm going to drink.

37:18.734 --> 37:19.767
- What are you guys
talking about?

37:20.000 --> 37:21.467
- But I just don't--

37:21.500 --> 37:23.133
But I'm not going to say
that nothing happened,

37:23.166 --> 37:25.033
because I don't know what--
- Everything.

37:25.066 --> 37:27.000
That's what I don't understand.
- No, but listen, listen.

37:29.166 --> 37:30.600
- I watched it happen.

37:30.633 --> 37:32.033
- What do you mean
you watched it happen?

37:32.066 --> 37:34.400
You watched Hope
have sex with James?

37:34.433 --> 37:36.467
- Hi, hi.
- Can I just talk to you

37:36.500 --> 37:37.700
for just two seconds?
- No, you can't.

37:37.734 --> 37:39.500
You're being a ----ing--
- No, I'm not.

37:39.533 --> 37:41.467
Fall back,
you insert yourself so quick.

37:41.500 --> 37:43.667
- You're the biggest bitch I've
ever ----ing met in my life.

37:43.700 --> 37:46.100
- Shut up!
off!

37:46.133 --> 37:48.133
- That's what I'm
talking about, Raquel.

37:48.166 --> 37:49.567
- This isn't the James, no.

37:49.600 --> 37:52.367
- No, this is the James
that everyone knows.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.367
Wake up, Raquel!
I want to shake you.

37:54.400 --> 37:56.500
- No, wait, who are you
hearing this from?

37:56.533 --> 37:58.166
- I'm in there with Hope

37:58.200 --> 38:01.567
when your man is there
and you're at school, wake up.

38:01.600 --> 38:03.166
- I don't trust Hope.

38:03.200 --> 38:05.500
- Come on,
you cannot be this dumb.

38:05.533 --> 38:07.166
- Don't talk to me like that.
- No, don't say that.

38:07.200 --> 38:10.500
- I'm going to say it.
- I'm not dumb, Lala.

38:10.533 --> 38:13.500
- What is so hard for you
to understand, Raquel?

38:13.533 --> 38:17.133
When you were in Sonoma getting
your degree in kinesiology,

38:17.166 --> 38:19.567
your boyfriend
was getting his degree

38:19.600 --> 38:21.667
in shoving his dick
in people who are not you.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.567
I want you to wake up!
It's offensive.

38:23.600 --> 38:26.433
- No, as someone who's supposed
to support other women,

38:26.467 --> 38:28.200
I feel like you're not.

38:28.233 --> 38:31.100
- Honey, I don't support you
because I watched you sit back

38:31.133 --> 38:33.633
while James, like,
assassinates me with his words.

38:33.667 --> 38:35.734
- I'm sorry that
he's hurting your feelings.

38:35.767 --> 38:37.633
- Like, he affected
my life, honey.

38:37.667 --> 38:39.133
He's affected a lot of people,

38:39.166 --> 38:40.600
and I wish that you
would just wake up

38:40.633 --> 38:41.734
and put him in his place.
That's all.

38:41.767 --> 38:43.133
We're good, I'm cool.

38:44.567 --> 38:46.033
- You're the only one
that cares, Tom.

38:46.066 --> 38:47.533
You're the only one
that really cares.

38:47.567 --> 38:49.100
You're the only one
that knows the truth.

38:49.133 --> 38:50.633
- Sit down, sit down.
- You're the only one

38:50.667 --> 38:52.567
that knows the truth.

38:52.600 --> 38:55.166
People are throwing allegations
at me, and it's bullsh--.

38:55.200 --> 38:57.233
Allegations of having
done sh--.

38:57.266 --> 39:00.467
- I know, but James, there's
been a lot of allegations, man.

39:00.500 --> 39:02.467
It doesn't mean they're true.

39:02.500 --> 39:04.567
- Not a single one of them
can be true, right?

39:04.600 --> 39:07.633
- No, not at all.
I swear on my mother's life.

39:07.667 --> 39:09.200
- There's a lot
of smoking guns here.

39:09.233 --> 39:10.667
There was Ellie,

39:10.700 --> 39:13.166
who had a picture of her
in bed with James.

39:13.200 --> 39:14.633
- God, this girl,
taking pictures

39:14.667 --> 39:16.233
of me when I'm sleeping.

39:16.266 --> 39:19.433
- There was Gigi, who had
some of James' clothes.

39:19.467 --> 39:21.600
- I wanted to give you this.

39:21.633 --> 39:23.166
- Yeah.

39:25.300 --> 39:26.667
- Do I think that James

39:26.700 --> 39:29.166
has cheated on Raquel
at some point?

39:29.200 --> 39:31.667
Uh, yeah, probably.

39:31.700 --> 39:33.600
- You think I'm trying
to  it up with Raquel?

39:33.633 --> 39:35.200
She's the best thing that's
ever happened in my whole life.

39:35.233 --> 39:37.233
- I know, but she wasn't
always around, dude.

39:38.700 --> 39:40.066

He needs to go.
You know that.

39:55.233 --> 39:57.667
He's been DJing all day.
He works here.

39:57.700 --> 39:59.233
- Tom.

39:59.266 --> 40:01.133

right now, I get that.

40:01.166 --> 40:02.633
- I'm not triggered!
Can I have my glasses back?

40:02.667 --> 40:05.700
- What is this excuse
that he's triggered?

40:05.734 --> 40:07.533
- Thank you.

40:07.567 --> 40:08.734
- If anyone
should be triggered,

40:08.767 --> 40:10.166
it should be Lala,
and she's not.

40:10.200 --> 40:12.000
She's killing it

40:12.033 --> 40:13.633
I'm done with it.
- What, hold on.

40:13.667 --> 40:15.233
- I miss you, Lala.
I miss you.

40:15.266 --> 40:17.133
- You're taking this as,
like, an ambush.

40:17.166 --> 40:18.667
- It is an ambush.
- Just stop

40:18.700 --> 40:20.500
and understand why people
are not cool with you.

40:20.533 --> 40:22.300
- These girls hated you
last year when we were cool.

40:24.734 --> 40:26.233
- They hated me,
and now we're cool.

40:26.266 --> 40:27.667
- Stop bringing them
into your mix!

40:27.700 --> 40:29.633
- I'm speaking.
Stop ----ing up.

40:29.667 --> 40:31.100
- Fine.
- Please, I beg you.

40:33.333 --> 40:36.233
- You need intense help, then.
- Okay.

40:44.667 --> 40:46.533

on you, darling.

Those shorts aren't working

Like, trust me, ask Schwartz.

40:56.100 --> 40:58.333
He knows.
I'm sure he knows the most.

40:58.367 --> 41:00.300
What a nightmare.

41:00.333 --> 41:02.567
- No, don't come back.
Don't come back.

at my friends.

41:05.133 --> 41:06.600
Don't talk to my friends.

41:06.633 --> 41:07.734
- She shouldn't be wearing
those shorts.

41:07.767 --> 41:09.567
They're not very flattering.

41:16.734 --> 41:18.367
- All right.

41:18.400 --> 41:21.533
James has a history
of pointing out

41:21.567 --> 41:23.333
someone's insecurities,

41:23.367 --> 41:26.100
and then just--
really using them

41:26.133 --> 41:27.667
as a weapon against them,

41:27.700 --> 41:32.233
and that is a pretty sh---y
quality to have.

41:32.266 --> 41:35.066
Come up with something
a little more inspired

41:35.100 --> 41:38.100
than just calling me fat.

41:41.166 --> 41:45.200
- Okay, now, I hope down here
is going as well as back there.

41:45.233 --> 41:47.633
I want to see
how James is doing.

41:47.667 --> 41:49.367

with me?

You want to  with me?

No one can replace

Let's go.

Just because I'm a DJ!

I'm all for equality, but that
whore can go  herself.

"Vanderpump Rules"...

taking a joke, Stassi.

You have--you got a ----ing
dildo up your ass.

42:10.367 --> 42:12.233

angry at me right now--

42:30.433 --> 42:32.633
- Yeah.
- Scheana will be

42:32.667 --> 42:36.000
disappointed to not

42:36.033 --> 42:37.333
- We don't hang out

42:37.367 --> 42:39.200
- I feel like you're friends

because you have
no loyalty to anyone.

I am not willing to work

42:57.767 --> 43:00.233

it's an ultimatum.
