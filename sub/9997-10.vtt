00:57.423 --> 00:59.400
         (Joe coughing)         

01:00.977 --> 01:02.953
             Hey. You all right?

01:04.330 --> 01:05.669
Need something cold.            

01:05.704 --> 01:07.212
            Hey, how's that flu?

01:07.247 --> 01:09.324
 That cough doesn't sound good. 

01:09.359 --> 01:10.899
     I don't know why not.      

01:10.968 --> 01:13.615
    I've been practicing it     
        all night.              

01:17.610 --> 01:21.580
 "You Give Me Fever"        

01:59.648 --> 02:00.988
                 No, no, no, no,
                I understand.   

02:01.022 --> 02:02.966
                 I don't live in
             your area, but I...

02:03.034 --> 02:05.312
     I've called all the clinics
        around us, and, well,   

02:05.347 --> 02:08.095
         they all seem to be out
             of the flu vaccine.

02:08.163 --> 02:09.638
             N-no, I understand.

02:09.673 --> 02:11.414
                  The very young
            and the very old.   

02:11.449 --> 02:12.856
                The thing is, my
                 husband's sick,

02:12.891 --> 02:14.633
                 and I'm worried
             that if I get sick,

02:14.668 --> 02:15.975
            there's not going   
                    to be anyone

02:16.009 --> 02:17.952
                 to take care of
                 our three kids.

02:21.105 --> 02:22.813
            You can?            
        (chuckles)              

02:22.849 --> 02:24.188
        You will?               

02:24.222 --> 02:25.529
              Oh.               

02:25.597 --> 02:27.541
             11:45.             

02:27.575 --> 02:31.866
    Um, is there any way you    
could do that any earlier?      

02:31.901 --> 02:34.883
    It's just that Chandler     
  is so far from where I work.  

02:35.924 --> 02:36.962
You know what, never mind.      

02:36.996 --> 02:38.001
          Never mind.           

02:38.036 --> 02:39.375
    11:45. I will be there.     

02:39.444 --> 02:41.120
Don't give anyone my shot.      

02:41.187 --> 02:43.198
            Thanks.             

02:43.299 --> 02:44.640
Boy, you sure seem happy        

02:44.707 --> 02:46.483
for someone that's going        
to get a shot.                  

02:46.518 --> 02:47.590
          Yeah, I am.           

02:47.658 --> 02:49.199
    You guys are lucky          
    you got yours at school,    

02:49.233 --> 02:51.244
but I missed mine at work,      
 and with Daddy sick and all... 

02:51.279 --> 02:53.223
      Mom, do you want me       
      to take that to Dad       

02:53.291 --> 02:55.669
            so that you can, uh,
            have some breakfast?

02:55.738 --> 02:56.775
        Would you?              

02:56.878 --> 02:57.950
                        Yeah.   

02:57.984 --> 02:59.056
            Thanks.             

02:59.124 --> 03:00.397
BRIDGETTE:                      
Hey, Mom?                       

03:00.431 --> 03:02.945
      How's that detective      
      you work with doing?      

03:02.980 --> 03:04.354
              Detective Scanlon?

03:04.421 --> 03:05.594
              He's good.        

03:05.628 --> 03:07.337
         He's got a beautiful   
          little baby girl.     

03:07.438 --> 03:08.377
                  Yeah.         

03:08.444 --> 03:09.348
          He's good. Definitely.

03:09.450 --> 03:10.623
             Why do you ask?    

03:10.657 --> 03:12.534
I just had this dream last night

03:12.568 --> 03:15.014
  that didn't make much sense.  

03:15.050 --> 03:17.362
             What kind of dream?

03:17.430 --> 03:18.534
     It was nothing really.     

03:18.569 --> 03:20.781
  I mean, he was just sitting   
        in a restaurant         

03:20.815 --> 03:24.234
 with this pretty blonde lady,  
     and he was really sad.     

03:24.269 --> 03:25.240
He had                          
this little box,                

03:25.274 --> 03:27.018
and I think there               
was a ring in it.               

03:27.052 --> 03:30.136
     But the big thing is,      
    he was just really sad.     

03:30.170 --> 03:32.816
But, uh, that doesn't           
make sense, right?              

03:32.852 --> 03:34.762
     I mean, if he already      
          has a baby,           

03:34.796 --> 03:37.007
     then why was he giving     
    this lady a ring?           

03:37.043 --> 03:39.824
 And what would have to happen  
      to make him so sad?       

03:39.858 --> 03:41.501
      I don't know, honey.      

03:41.535 --> 03:43.445
         Those are all          
     really good questions.     

03:43.480 --> 03:46.764
  Hmm. So, you don't think it   
 makes much sense, either, huh? 

03:48.241 --> 03:50.016
             Cool.              

03:51.258 --> 03:52.799
     (elevator bell dings)      

03:55.951 --> 03:57.560
        (coughing)              

04:02.456 --> 04:05.170
     (sniffing)                 

04:05.205 --> 04:07.115
         (man coughing)         

04:18.113 --> 04:20.928
SCANLON:                        
So, what do you think?          

04:20.962 --> 04:23.040
Good ring, nice ring?           

04:23.107 --> 04:24.717
             It's very good.    

04:24.751 --> 04:27.096
              It's very nice.   

04:27.131 --> 04:28.538
You think Lynn will like it?    

04:29.579 --> 04:31.321
Well, of course, she'll like it.

04:31.390 --> 04:32.662
         Who wouldn't?          

04:32.730 --> 04:33.735
        (chuckles)              

04:33.770 --> 04:35.009
 I was thinking maybe tonight.  

04:35.043 --> 04:36.283
    Figure it's time.           

04:36.351 --> 04:37.590
I wait much longer,             
little Leigh                    

04:37.626 --> 04:39.870
will be old enough              
to be the maid of honor.        
                (chuckles)      

04:41.313 --> 04:43.424
        Boy, there's a lot of   
    strangers around here today.

04:43.459 --> 04:45.402
                What's going on?

04:45.437 --> 04:47.716
            SCANLON:            
 It's a big hush-hush briefing  
    with some guy from FEMA.    

04:47.784 --> 04:49.761
    You're not going?           
                      Not going.

04:49.863 --> 04:51.605
         Wasn't asked.          
    Damn glad about it, too.    

04:51.639 --> 04:53.952
I have somewhere to be at 11:45.

05:00.792 --> 05:03.172
              MAN:              
This picture was taken in 1996. 

05:03.206 --> 05:05.249
    The subject lived           
    in a small village          

05:05.285 --> 05:08.234
in the Democratic Republic      
         of the Congo.          

05:08.268 --> 05:11.990
He succumbed to a disease       
called viral hemorrhagic fever. 

05:12.057 --> 05:14.402
        It's very rare.         

05:14.437 --> 05:18.292
The strain responsible for this 
  man's death is called FV-39.  

05:18.326 --> 05:20.036
     Ladies and gentlemen,      

05:20.070 --> 05:23.087
          FV-39 is of           
    particular concern to us    

05:23.121 --> 05:27.077
because the virus holds up well 
in transport and weaponization. 

05:27.144 --> 05:29.054
 In fact, there are a few of us 

05:29.089 --> 05:31.938
      who believe that it       
    would be an ideal agent     

05:31.972 --> 05:34.452
for a bioterrorist attack       
against the United States.      

05:34.486 --> 05:36.129
          (man coughs)          

05:36.163 --> 05:38.174
      FEMA has been trying      
    to create an antiserum,     

05:38.208 --> 05:39.950
  a cure that can be deployed   

05:39.985 --> 05:42.967
in the event of just such       
     a bioterrorist attack.     

05:43.036 --> 05:44.643
  In fact, we've been working   
          very closely          

05:44.679 --> 05:46.287
with a company right here       
        in Phoenix              

05:46.321 --> 05:48.936
    that is at the forefront    
        of that effort.         

05:48.970 --> 05:51.550
Dr. Erik Westphal heads up      

05:51.585 --> 05:54.836
the bio-pathology division      
of United Southfield.           

05:54.904 --> 05:56.545
I'll let him take it            
from here.                      

05:56.580 --> 05:57.954
    Doctor.                     

05:57.989 --> 05:59.630
     Um... (clears throat)      

05:59.664 --> 06:03.050
     Our lab is a biosafety     
        level four lab.         

06:03.084 --> 06:04.525
 That means we're handling some 

06:04.559 --> 06:06.738
of the deadliest microbes       
         on the planet.         

06:06.772 --> 06:09.755
Uh, naturally, both our company 
and the federal government      

06:09.789 --> 06:12.806
  spend extraordinary amounts   
    of time and money           

06:12.841 --> 06:15.153
monitoring our inventory.       

06:16.629 --> 06:19.914
 When the government inspectors 
      gathered their data       

06:19.948 --> 06:21.456
and filed their latest reports, 

06:21.558 --> 06:23.300
         there appeared         
      to be trace amounts       

06:23.335 --> 06:26.519
of FV-39 cultures missing       
from some of our samples.       

06:26.553 --> 06:27.591
          (murmuring)           

06:27.660 --> 06:29.134
This isn't                      
the kind of thing               

06:29.169 --> 06:31.448
     that you would notice      
     on a day-to-day basis,     

06:31.515 --> 06:34.096
        but over time...        

06:34.131 --> 06:37.281
  There is a measurable amount  
          of this bug           

06:37.316 --> 06:39.694
         that we simply         
    can't account for.          

06:39.762 --> 06:41.069
          (murmuring)           

06:41.104 --> 06:43.383
MAN:                            
Worst case scenario,            
ladies and gentlemen,           

06:43.417 --> 06:45.930
  is that someone either sold   
     or gave these cultures     

06:45.965 --> 06:47.808
        to someone              
    who intends to use them     

06:47.842 --> 06:49.887
          as a weapon           
      of mass destruction.      

06:49.954 --> 06:52.099
        We at FEMA              
      need to move forward      

06:52.133 --> 06:53.742
 as though that were the case.  

06:53.776 --> 06:55.184
DINOVI:                         
So, what does this mean?        

06:55.219 --> 06:57.263
            Is Homeland Security
     issuing some kind of alert?

06:57.297 --> 06:58.804
              MAN:              
      Quite the contrary.       

06:58.839 --> 07:00.783
    There will be no alert.     

07:00.817 --> 07:02.761
 There will be no notification. 

07:02.795 --> 07:04.672
        There will be no        
      public announcement       

07:04.741 --> 07:05.979
of any kind.                    

07:06.047 --> 07:07.421
As a matter of fact,            

07:07.456 --> 07:09.533
        the only people         
  who know anything about this  

07:09.568 --> 07:11.411
          are sitting           
    in this room right now,     

07:11.479 --> 07:14.730
      and that is the way       
    it's got to stay.           

07:14.764 --> 07:18.586
  Dr. Westphal doesn't happen   
  to agree with that decision,  

07:18.620 --> 07:20.999
but the fact is, at this moment,
     ladies and gentlemen,      

07:21.067 --> 07:23.380
         we do not have         
     an effective antiserum     

07:23.415 --> 07:25.626
    in sufficient quantities    
    to deal with this.          

07:25.660 --> 07:27.806
          As a result,          
    the preventive measures     

07:27.840 --> 07:29.850
 that we can take are limited.  

07:29.886 --> 07:32.700
Dr. Westphal,                   
if this virus--                 

07:32.735 --> 07:35.617
this FV-39--                    
is out there,                   

07:35.652 --> 07:37.260
how bad could it get?           

07:37.328 --> 07:39.137
How many people                 
would be affected?              

07:40.143 --> 07:41.249
            It's hard to say.   

07:41.284 --> 07:42.893
                     It's not an
                 airborne virus.

07:42.927 --> 07:45.105
                 It is spread by
              people, to people,

07:45.172 --> 07:48.692
      and it carries a mortality
              rate of about 85%,

07:48.727 --> 07:50.906
which is what makes it          
such an effective threat.       

07:50.973 --> 07:53.655
Again, depending                
on how long it was out there    

07:53.689 --> 07:57.678
and how soon we were able       
        to contain it...        

07:57.712 --> 07:59.756
    hundreds of dead?           

07:59.824 --> 08:02.572
    Thousands, maybe.           

08:02.608 --> 08:05.858
    It's just too hard          
        to say for sure.        

08:07.000 --> 08:08.573
              JOE:              
    You did the right thing.    

08:08.642 --> 08:09.949
        (coughing)              

08:10.017 --> 08:11.591
  There's nothing to be gained  

08:11.626 --> 08:14.273
        by telling a man        
 who's contemplating proposing  

08:14.307 --> 08:17.760
      that it might not--       
 and I underline "might not"--  

08:17.795 --> 08:20.074
  go exactly the way he hopes.  

08:20.141 --> 08:21.213
         Yeah, I know.          

08:21.248 --> 08:22.654
         But you should         
      have seen his face.       

08:22.724 --> 08:23.829
    He looked so vulnerable.    

08:23.863 --> 08:25.773
I just... I hate the idea       

08:25.807 --> 08:27.650
         of him getting         
    his feelings hurt.          

08:27.684 --> 08:29.393
  Well, if Bridgette's right,   

08:29.428 --> 08:31.405
    he's going to get           
    his feelings hurt           

08:31.439 --> 08:32.881
    no matter what you do--     

08:32.914 --> 08:36.065
    um, either by you or...     
     or at dinner tonight.      

08:36.168 --> 08:37.472
              Huh.              

08:37.541 --> 08:38.714
         Well, thanks.          

08:38.748 --> 08:40.658
  That... that... that helps.   

08:40.693 --> 08:42.100
That feels better. Thanks.      

08:42.203 --> 08:43.207
         Anything else?         

08:43.241 --> 08:45.687
         Oh, uh, honey,         
     can you do me a favor?     

08:45.722 --> 08:47.833
        I'm running late        
        for my flu shot,        

08:47.869 --> 08:49.509
     and I left the number      
         of the clinic          

08:49.544 --> 08:50.784
 in the kitchen on the counter. 

08:50.818 --> 08:52.192
    Can you go read it to me    

08:52.226 --> 08:54.304
     so I can let them know     
     that I'm still coming?     

08:54.338 --> 08:56.517
    You want me to go           
all the way back to the kitchen?

08:56.551 --> 08:58.059
         Honey, please.         
    (tires screeching)          

08:58.093 --> 09:00.674
    I don't want them           
to give away my flu shot.       

09:11.136 --> 09:12.575
        You still there?        

09:12.611 --> 09:14.185
     I think there's going      
    to be an accident.          

09:14.253 --> 09:15.291
             What?              

09:15.327 --> 09:16.331
Honey, hang up the phone.       

09:16.366 --> 09:17.471
        Call 911.               

09:17.506 --> 09:18.879
 Tell them to send an ambulance 

09:18.914 --> 09:21.125
to North Beeline Highway,       
 just south of Shea Boulevard.  

09:21.160 --> 09:22.600
Tell them to send a fire truck. 

09:22.634 --> 09:24.076
         There's a man          
     who's about to crash,      

09:24.111 --> 09:26.355
    and he's got a backseat     
    full of gasoline.           

09:43.857 --> 09:44.929
          Sir!                  

09:44.997 --> 09:46.773
                Sir! Wake up!   

09:46.808 --> 09:48.450
            (coughs)            

09:48.484 --> 09:50.159
          Sir, sir, wake up!    

09:50.194 --> 09:51.668
What are you doing?             

09:51.703 --> 09:53.512
         Get out of the car now.

09:55.926 --> 09:57.737
      Your car's on fire.       
    You have to get out now.    

09:57.771 --> 09:59.211
     No. Get away!              

09:59.246 --> 10:00.720
    Get away from me!           

10:00.755 --> 10:01.960
         Open the door!         

10:01.995 --> 10:04.006
    Go away! Get away!          

10:04.073 --> 10:05.548
    You have to get out now.    

10:05.617 --> 10:07.090
  Your car's going to explode.  

10:07.192 --> 10:08.332
        Get away!               
                             No.

10:08.366 --> 10:10.409
I want to die, damn it!         

10:10.445 --> 10:11.415
        Go!                     

10:11.484 --> 10:12.455
                      It's going
                     to explode!

10:12.522 --> 10:15.405
Go! Go!                         

10:21.441 --> 10:25.529
          (explosion)           

10:25.563 --> 10:26.635
            I just don't get it.

10:26.669 --> 10:27.976
                    I mean, what
                    is the point

10:28.045 --> 10:29.552
            of dreaming about   
    something like this if...   

10:29.586 --> 10:31.161
            if you can't stop   
              it from happening?

10:31.196 --> 10:33.274
Well, I wish I had              
an answer for you.              

10:33.308 --> 10:35.352
I'm just glad he                
didn't take you with him.       

10:35.387 --> 10:37.330
Did, uh... did he               
say anything to you             

10:37.398 --> 10:38.872
before the car                  
blew up?                        

10:38.906 --> 10:40.381
         No, he just kept saying

10:40.416 --> 10:43.063
          that he wasn't getting
                 out of the car.

10:43.098 --> 10:46.683
        He kept telling me to   
          go away over and over.

10:47.724 --> 10:50.607
Look, uh, the driver            
was determined to do            

10:50.641 --> 10:52.619
what he was determined to do.   

10:52.653 --> 10:54.998
He turned his car into a bomb.  

10:55.033 --> 10:57.781
Even if you had managed         
to get him out of it,           

10:57.849 --> 10:59.659
don't you think that ultimately 
he would have found             

10:59.694 --> 11:01.235
some other way                  
to get the job done?            

11:01.269 --> 11:03.950
            (sighs)             

11:03.984 --> 11:06.565
            Oh, God.            

11:11.997 --> 11:15.114
            (sighs)             

11:24.000 --> 11:26.782
            (gasps)             

11:26.850 --> 11:28.961
You okay?                       

11:31.477 --> 11:34.191
                 Yeah.          

11:34.225 --> 11:37.242
    Yeah, fine, I guess, I...   

11:37.277 --> 11:38.449
            What time is it?    

11:38.484 --> 11:40.159
    It's 1:45.                  

11:40.193 --> 11:41.164
          Why?                  

11:41.199 --> 11:42.203
                Damn it.        

11:42.272 --> 11:43.646
Is there anything               
I can help you with?            

11:43.680 --> 11:45.959
            I had an appointment
        to go get a flu shot,   

11:45.993 --> 11:48.105
      which is why I'm out here.

11:48.139 --> 11:50.418
    That was over two hours ago.

11:50.487 --> 11:52.060
              You know what?    
                It's fine.      

11:52.096 --> 11:55.515
    I'm just going to call them,
          I'm gonna apologize...

11:55.549 --> 11:56.687
                 (sighs)        

11:56.723 --> 11:59.538
                Suddenly I'm not
         feeling so good anyway.

11:59.572 --> 12:01.550
            I think I might have
    already caught Joe's bug.   

12:01.584 --> 12:03.829
Well, do me a favor             
and don't sneeze on me, okay?   

12:03.897 --> 12:06.176
I have big plans                
tonight, remember?              

12:06.243 --> 12:09.193
          ¶ For she's           
     a jolly good fellow ¶      

12:09.260 --> 12:11.809
    ¶ For she's a jolly good    
            fellow ¶            

12:11.876 --> 12:14.859
          ¶ For she's           
     a jolly good fellow ¶      

12:14.961 --> 12:17.508
¶ Which nobody can deny. ¶      

12:17.542 --> 12:19.855
        (cheering)              

12:19.889 --> 12:21.329
Hey, sorry I'm late.            

12:21.364 --> 12:22.838
(sighing)                       

12:26.527 --> 12:28.470
          You okay?             

12:28.538 --> 12:30.985
                Look at them.   

12:31.053 --> 12:33.836
They have no idea.              

12:36.585 --> 12:38.730
                I can't help it.

12:38.765 --> 12:39.803
          I can't help wondering

12:39.837 --> 12:42.653
            how many of them are
             going to survive...

12:42.687 --> 12:44.095
                 if you're going
                to survive...   

12:44.129 --> 12:46.944
              if little Leigh is
            going to survive.   

12:46.978 --> 12:48.688
No, you can't talk              
that way.                       

12:48.722 --> 12:51.470
You can't think that way.       

12:51.504 --> 12:53.615
     We'll figure this out,     
         we always do.          

12:53.683 --> 12:55.024
                      Really?   

12:55.059 --> 12:56.265
              Are we any further
                along tonight   

12:56.299 --> 12:57.941
                    than we were
                this morning?   

12:57.976 --> 13:00.255
         Do we know anything now
    that we didn't know then?   

13:00.289 --> 13:02.835
            How do you do it?   

13:02.904 --> 13:04.713
            How do you stop a   
            thing you can't see?

13:04.781 --> 13:05.987
    (distant laughter)          

13:08.000 --> 13:11.352
                  I think I just
                want to go home.

13:11.420 --> 13:13.564
             I think I just want
             to be with my baby.

13:18.494 --> 13:20.471
         Oh, I'm sorry.         

13:20.505 --> 13:21.812
        What am I doing?        

13:21.846 --> 13:23.555
 We didn't come here for this.  

13:23.589 --> 13:26.137
Uh, you said there was something
you wanted to talk to me about, 

13:26.205 --> 13:27.712
                    something   
                      important.

13:27.747 --> 13:31.435
You know what? It'll keep.      

13:31.469 --> 13:33.982
    Let's just go home          
     and be with our baby.      

13:35.022 --> 13:37.904
            ALLISON:            
          I don't know.         

13:37.939 --> 13:42.632
I saw this horrible thing       
    and then I just--           

13:42.666 --> 13:44.040
    I got the shakes.           
        (beeping)               

13:44.074 --> 13:48.063
 And then I felt kind of dizzy, 
    felt kind of achy.          

13:48.097 --> 13:51.047
                        99.6.   

13:51.081 --> 13:53.360
Huh?                            

13:53.395 --> 13:54.936
              You are one degree
                above normal.   

13:54.970 --> 13:57.652
(sighing):                      
I feel like I'm dying.          

13:57.720 --> 14:00.065
                    Well, I'm   
                 sorry, Allison.

14:00.100 --> 14:02.177
            I don't want to make
              a liar out of you,

14:02.247 --> 14:06.470
        but people do not die   
         from one-degree fevers.

14:06.504 --> 14:08.682
            I know that's not   
          what you want to hear,

14:08.716 --> 14:12.370
        and it's no fun being   
         the bearer of bad news,

14:12.471 --> 14:14.381
            but I think you have
            what everyone has   

14:14.417 --> 14:18.069
              and I think you're
                  going to live.

14:18.103 --> 14:19.276
                     Now...     

14:19.345 --> 14:23.534
                    (coughs)    

14:23.569 --> 14:26.048
                    Want to hear
                 some good news?

14:26.083 --> 14:28.765
            Now that we are both
              sick with the flu,

14:28.799 --> 14:31.547
        I believe we can once   
    again share the same bed.   

14:31.582 --> 14:34.632
Wait a second,                  
what's the good news?           

14:34.666 --> 14:36.443
     (chuckles)                 

14:36.477 --> 14:39.392
        Ariel can take the girls
             to school tomorrow,

14:39.461 --> 14:40.835
         and maybe I'll actually
                feel good enough

14:40.869 --> 14:42.879
             to go back to work.

14:46.333 --> 14:49.081
            (sighs)             

14:49.116 --> 14:54.044
    Try to get this morning     
        out of my mind.         

14:54.078 --> 14:58.100
The smell of all that gasoline, 

14:58.134 --> 15:00.783
 the smell of that man burning. 

15:03.834 --> 15:05.845
     (engine accelerating)      

15:18.250 --> 15:21.200
            (coughs)            

15:28.979 --> 15:31.125
            (gasps)             

15:31.192 --> 15:32.365
             Lee...             

15:32.432 --> 15:33.604
hi, sorry to call so late.      

15:33.640 --> 15:35.851
 I-I know you had a big evening 
        and all, but...         

15:35.919 --> 15:38.131
    SCANLON (quietly):          
Oh, no, no, that's okay, I, uh, 

15:38.199 --> 15:41.550
    I kind of called a flag     
          on the play.          

15:41.585 --> 15:44.568
  Right idea, uh, wrong night.  

15:44.602 --> 15:46.077
            Really?             

15:46.145 --> 15:47.384
        What's up?              

15:47.418 --> 15:49.899
         I don't know,          
 I-I just had the oddest dream  

15:49.933 --> 15:53.050
about that man who burned       
himself alive today in that car.

15:53.085 --> 15:55.665
I think he was sick, Lee,       
          really sick.          

15:55.733 --> 15:56.973
    What do you mean?           

15:57.008 --> 15:59.655
         I don't know,          
 I just had a dream, and in it  

15:59.723 --> 16:00.963
        he was coughing,        

16:00.997 --> 16:05.455
he had these white, oozy things 
      on his face, and...       

16:05.490 --> 16:09.881
    he was bleeding a little    
 around his eyes and his nose.  

16:09.915 --> 16:11.088
            Oh, no.             

16:11.122 --> 16:15.077
  What do you mean, "Oh, no"?   

16:15.112 --> 16:16.720
            What people have you
            been in contact with

16:16.754 --> 16:18.263
 since you were at the accident?

16:18.297 --> 16:19.871
    What do you mean,           
    "in contact with"?          

16:19.940 --> 16:20.944
     Allison, think, what people

16:20.978 --> 16:22.253
            have you been around
             since the accident?

16:22.287 --> 16:23.727
              You,              

16:23.795 --> 16:27.918
 all the police and the medical 
people who showed up, my family.

16:27.953 --> 16:30.198
              Why?              

16:30.233 --> 16:31.941
        Lee, talk to me.        

16:31.976 --> 16:33.182
        What's going on?        

16:33.217 --> 16:35.897
         We may have a problem--

16:35.965 --> 16:40.725
                  you, me...    

16:40.793 --> 16:42.234
                  all of us.    

16:42.269 --> 16:44.346
        Stay put,               
 I'm gonna call you right back. 

16:44.381 --> 16:46.358
W-What do you mean, "Stay put"? 

16:46.426 --> 16:48.202
        What's going on?        

16:48.237 --> 16:51.220
          Lee... Lee.           

16:51.287 --> 16:55.175
        It seems weird,         
 eating while it's still dark.  

16:55.210 --> 16:56.718
    I know, I'm sorry, guys.    

16:56.752 --> 16:58.126
                 So are we going
                 to school today

16:58.160 --> 16:59.198
                    or what?    

16:59.233 --> 17:00.338
I don't know,                   

17:00.407 --> 17:02.786
      honey, I don't know       
        what's going on.        

17:02.820 --> 17:04.630
    They just told us           
      to wake everybody up      

17:04.665 --> 17:07.378
         and make sure          
that we don't go outside.       

17:07.414 --> 17:10.464
         We can't open          
     any windows or doors.      

17:10.498 --> 17:11.904
        They were going         
    to come over soon           

17:11.940 --> 17:14.386
 and explain everything to us.  

17:14.420 --> 17:16.262
JOE:                            
There are trucks outside.       

17:16.332 --> 17:17.537
They don't have                 
their lights on,                

17:17.573 --> 17:19.851
      but I can hear them,      

17:19.952 --> 17:23.036
 and people are doing something 
    on the front lawn.          

17:23.069 --> 17:24.780
        You sure I can't        
      just open the door?       

17:24.814 --> 17:28.635
 No, Devalos was very specific. 

17:28.669 --> 17:30.344
                          ARIEL:
        There's a man outside   
              my bedroom window.

17:30.379 --> 17:32.993
He's putting up plastic         
or something.                   

17:33.027 --> 17:36.481
         (phone rings)          

17:36.515 --> 17:37.821
                 Hello.         

17:37.889 --> 17:39.665
              MAN:              
          May I speak           
  with Allison Dubois, please?  

17:39.700 --> 17:41.341
            This is her husband.
                 Can I help you?

17:41.409 --> 17:43.118
    Is everyone awake?          

17:43.153 --> 17:45.398
 We don't want to unnecessarily 
        frighten anyone.        

17:45.432 --> 17:46.539
    What do you mean,           
      "Is everyone awake?"      

17:46.573 --> 17:48.080
    Who am I speaking with?     

17:48.114 --> 17:49.823
This is Dr. Erik Westphal.      

17:49.892 --> 17:51.097
I'm with United Southfield      
         Laboratories.          

17:51.132 --> 17:52.337
 I'm here with the FEMA people. 

17:52.406 --> 17:53.377
    Is everyone awake?          

17:53.412 --> 17:54.719
     Are you ready for us?      

17:54.753 --> 17:57.669
We'd love to get this over with 
    before the sun comes up     

17:57.704 --> 17:59.815
and your neighbors notice       
    what we're up to.           
What is he saying?              

17:59.849 --> 18:01.055
      Well, wait a second.      

18:01.123 --> 18:02.563
      What are you up to?       

18:02.632 --> 18:04.810
Just open the front door,       
          Mr. Dubois.           

18:04.878 --> 18:06.018
      We're right outside.      

18:07.058 --> 18:09.403
                  They're at the
                     front door.

18:13.126 --> 18:15.070
    (knocking on door)          

18:15.137 --> 18:18.287
                    WESTPHAL:   
                Mr. Dubois, this
                is Dr. Westphal.

18:20.334 --> 18:24.860
  Mr. Dubois... are you there?  

18:24.894 --> 18:26.837
                  Could you open
            the door, please?   

18:26.905 --> 18:27.843
                      We're, uh,

18:27.911 --> 18:29.318
                  kind of racing
                      the clock.

18:33.711 --> 18:35.654
             Mrs. Dubois has had
                 direct contact.

18:35.722 --> 18:37.565
             I need her isolated
        in a room by herself.   

18:37.599 --> 18:39.074
                  The father and
                    the children

18:39.109 --> 18:41.153
                 can be examined
             together somewhere.

18:41.187 --> 18:42.226
Wait a minute.                  

18:42.261 --> 18:43.366
             Mrs. Dubois, I need
                 to examine you.

18:43.400 --> 18:44.774
                  I need samples

18:44.808 --> 18:47.623
     of your blood, your saliva,
      your hair, and your urine.

18:47.657 --> 18:48.629
  What are you talking about?   

18:48.663 --> 18:49.635
     What is going on here?     

18:49.669 --> 18:51.144
 Why do you need to examine me? 

18:51.178 --> 18:53.424
Why do you need to examine      
  my husband and my children?   

18:53.458 --> 18:54.966
            I promise you I will
    explain everything to you   

18:55.000 --> 18:55.972
                 at the earliest
                    opportunity,

18:56.006 --> 18:57.882
        but right now I need you

18:57.951 --> 19:00.028
        to show my colleagues   
         back into your bedroom.

19:00.064 --> 19:02.308
      Every moment we lose could
          potentially compromise

19:02.377 --> 19:04.689
            your health and your
                family's health.

19:28.427 --> 19:30.839
                      (clanging)

19:40.830 --> 19:42.841
(rustling)                      

19:42.909 --> 19:45.422
(door opens)                    

19:47.367 --> 19:49.680
Mrs. Dubois,                    

19:49.714 --> 19:51.557
    I'm, uh, I'm sorry          
    this has taken so long.     

19:51.591 --> 19:53.536
              Where's my family?
                     I can't get

19:53.570 --> 19:54.608
      a hold of my family.      

19:54.643 --> 19:56.218
      I keep texting them,      
         calling them.          

19:56.253 --> 19:58.665
    They don't answer,          
     they don't write back.     

19:58.699 --> 19:59.939
Well, your husband is           

19:59.974 --> 20:02.253
      in the living room,       
getting an IV drip for his flu. 

20:02.287 --> 20:03.393
        (clears throat)         

20:03.427 --> 20:05.471
  Your kids were totally fine,  

20:05.506 --> 20:08.153
and your eldest daughter        
took them to school.            

20:08.188 --> 20:12.143
    As for you, do you sleep    
      on a feather pillow?      

20:12.211 --> 20:14.020
    Well... What? Why?          

20:14.089 --> 20:15.093
         You shouldn't.         

20:15.128 --> 20:16.702
        You're allergic.        

20:16.736 --> 20:18.546
 Other than that, you're fine.  

20:18.647 --> 20:19.787
        Are you serious?        

20:19.821 --> 20:21.631
    You show up at my house     
     looking like something     

20:21.665 --> 20:24.581
out of a science fiction movie, 
 and you tell me that I'm fine, 

20:24.616 --> 20:26.760
     that everyone's fine,      
    that everything is fine?    

20:26.794 --> 20:28.671
Yeah, I am sorry,               
but we had no choice.           

20:28.705 --> 20:30.817
Okay, the man that you saw      
kill himself yesterday          

20:30.852 --> 20:32.930
was a biologist                 
who worked in my lab.           

20:32.964 --> 20:35.846
  His name was Mitchell Lomis   
 and he was apparently infected 

20:35.914 --> 20:40.037
  with a very, very dangerous   
      virus called FV-39.       

20:40.072 --> 20:44.027
    You thought that I caught   
     this virus, whatever it is?

20:44.061 --> 20:46.909
  Yeah, you and all the other   
people who rushed to help Mitch.

20:46.978 --> 20:48.754
This virus...                   

20:50.833 --> 20:54.923
  There are organizations, uh,  
        movements               

20:54.957 --> 20:59.147
    that would pay a fortune    
for even a minute amount of it. 

20:59.182 --> 21:01.762
    Y-You infect one person     
      and then expose him       

21:01.830 --> 21:03.942
 to as many people as possible  
    before he succumbs          

21:03.976 --> 21:06.187
      and you can decimate      
         a small city.          

21:06.257 --> 21:08.803
At our lab we were working      
on this virus,                  

21:08.837 --> 21:10.714
    working on a cure.          

21:10.782 --> 21:13.430
How Mitch became infected,      
      we still don't know,      

21:13.464 --> 21:15.743
      but I can't believe       
    that it was an accident.    

21:15.778 --> 21:17.554
         There are just         
      too many safeguards,      

21:17.588 --> 21:20.403
 too many checks and balances.  

21:20.438 --> 21:21.745
          The fear is           

21:21.779 --> 21:24.225
     that he was attempting     
to steal some and sell it.      

21:24.260 --> 21:26.203
                 How well do you
            know this person?   

21:26.238 --> 21:28.282
          Uh, does he strike you
        as the kind of person   

21:28.316 --> 21:30.326
                    who could do
            something like that?

21:30.362 --> 21:33.344
  There's a time when I would   
have said absolutely not.       

21:33.379 --> 21:35.355
      But he went through       
     a pretty ugly divorce      

21:35.425 --> 21:37.032
     a couple of years ago.     

21:37.067 --> 21:40.217
He had some financial struggles,
      emotional struggles.      

21:40.252 --> 21:43.234
Just wrestling with depression. 

21:43.302 --> 21:45.917
      I-I just keep hoping      

21:45.952 --> 21:47.928
    that whatever he took...    

21:47.964 --> 21:50.511
    it was incinerated          
    right when he was.          

21:50.578 --> 21:51.751
     But what if it wasn't?     

21:51.785 --> 21:52.957
 What if it's still out there?  

21:53.026 --> 21:56.009
         Yeah, well...          

21:56.043 --> 21:58.658
      let's just pray that      
      that's not the case.      

22:00.703 --> 22:02.848
Uh, it's not that we            

22:02.916 --> 22:04.859
    don't have an antivirus,    
          by the way.           

22:04.928 --> 22:06.201
  It's just that we don't have  
         enough funding         

22:06.235 --> 22:08.716
  to produce it in meaningful   
          quantities.           

22:08.750 --> 22:11.733
 It's about two cents a person, 
        actually.               

22:11.767 --> 22:15.454
 I mean, if every U.S. citizen  
        paid two cents,         

22:15.488 --> 22:18.437
 we'd have enough to inoculate  
  the entire city of Phoenix.   

22:18.505 --> 22:20.282
        Or Philadelphia.        

22:20.316 --> 22:23.400
        Or San Antonio.         

22:23.434 --> 22:25.444
    Just astounding, right?     

22:30.005 --> 22:31.983
          NEWSCASTER:           
 ...with the new increase       

22:32.051 --> 22:35.335
     and the mystery virus,     
nobody knows very much about it.

22:35.370 --> 22:37.146
        A short time ago        
it was completely unknown.      

22:37.214 --> 22:38.855
            How are you feeling?

22:38.891 --> 22:40.867
              Hey.              

22:40.902 --> 22:42.879
Pretty amazing, actually.       

22:42.914 --> 22:45.896
    They hydrated me,           
 they gave me some antibiotics. 

22:45.931 --> 22:47.908
Hell of a house call.           

22:47.943 --> 22:49.718
How about you?                  

22:49.786 --> 22:51.562
        I'm fine.               

22:51.596 --> 22:52.836
    It-it's all gone.           

22:52.871 --> 22:54.680
  The achiness. The dizziness.  

22:54.748 --> 22:56.155
 He said it was all in my head. 

22:56.223 --> 22:59.039
     I guess he was right.      

22:59.073 --> 23:02.358
Did anyone explain this to you, 
what they were doing here?      

23:02.393 --> 23:03.597
No one had to.                  

23:03.633 --> 23:05.710
It's all over the TV.           

23:05.745 --> 23:08.727
Representatives from FEMA       
and a Phoenix biotech firm      

23:08.762 --> 23:10.236
        began showing up        
        on the doorsteps        

23:10.271 --> 23:12.750
  of police and rescue workers  
before dawn this morning,       

23:12.818 --> 23:15.701
  concerned that they may have  
contracted a deadly virus.      

23:15.735 --> 23:18.684
So far none of the city workers 
      have tested positive      

23:18.753 --> 23:20.127
      and officials remain      
          tight-lipped          

23:20.195 --> 23:22.139
 about whether or not the virus 
        remains a threat        

23:22.173 --> 23:23.413
    to the general populace.    

23:23.447 --> 23:26.396
So much for secrets.            

23:26.431 --> 23:28.408
     (elevator bell dings)      

23:37.963 --> 23:39.974
     (elevator bell dings)      

23:42.289 --> 23:44.300
        (phones ringing)        

23:53.989 --> 23:55.799
                        DEVALOS:
        You feeling left out?   

23:55.834 --> 23:56.972
                You want one?   

23:57.040 --> 23:58.549
        A mask, I mean.         

23:58.583 --> 24:00.225
 I know a guy who knows a guy.  

24:00.260 --> 24:01.599
        Oh, no, no, no.         
        I'm holding out         

24:01.634 --> 24:03.779
for one of those full body suits

24:03.813 --> 24:06.696
    that those guys who came    
 to my house this morning had.  

24:06.730 --> 24:09.176
          Lot of fear.          

24:09.211 --> 24:12.194
      About 20% of the staff are
          taking a personal day.

24:12.228 --> 24:14.406
About to have a little briefing 
    in the conference room.     

24:14.508 --> 24:15.613
    You want to come along?     

24:15.681 --> 24:17.659
             Yeah.              

24:19.101 --> 24:20.676
     As soon as we realized     

24:20.710 --> 24:23.694
that this Lomis fellow had been 
infected with the missing virus 

24:23.728 --> 24:26.375
  and the fact that he worked   
     for United Southfield,     

24:26.411 --> 24:28.320
    we began investigating.     

24:28.354 --> 24:31.874
  Dr. Westphal gave us access   
    to his office computers,    

24:31.909 --> 24:34.723
and we obtained a warrant       
    for his laptop as well.     

24:35.764 --> 24:37.674
  We discovered that Mr. Lomis  

24:37.708 --> 24:39.082
    had been using an alias     

24:39.116 --> 24:42.200
      to log onto several       
    anti-American Web sites,    

24:42.234 --> 24:46.055
and that he had indeed contacted
a potential buyer for the virus.

24:46.089 --> 24:48.067
     Now the good news is,      

24:48.101 --> 24:51.520
the e-mails indicate that       
 the sale was never completed.  

24:51.556 --> 24:55.578
Our best guess is that Mr. Lomis
 inadvertently infected himself 

24:55.612 --> 24:57.924
      as he was attempting      
    to dispose of the virus     

24:57.959 --> 25:01.444
  as soon he realized that the  
 sale was not going to happen.  

25:01.479 --> 25:04.260
         We now believe         

25:04.328 --> 25:08.150
  that everything that he had   
        was in that car.        

25:08.184 --> 25:12.005
We believe that everything      
that he had burned up with him. 

25:13.347 --> 25:15.324
    And so I'm pleased          
to inform you this morning      

25:15.358 --> 25:17.169
that even as we're sitting here,

25:17.203 --> 25:19.683
the mayor's office is announcing
     to the general public      

25:19.718 --> 25:23.204
    that there is no longer     
any threat from the FV-39 virus.

25:29.105 --> 25:31.450
    And just when you think     

25:31.485 --> 25:33.428
that there is nothing good      

25:33.463 --> 25:36.312
  that can come from something  
  potentially so frightening,   

25:36.346 --> 25:39.162
the folks on Capitol Hill       
      woke up this morning      

25:39.197 --> 25:42.179
and heard about the panic       
that was slowly spreading       

25:42.214 --> 25:44.191
throughout the Southwest,       

25:44.226 --> 25:47.208
and I've been told that an      
 appropriation is in the works  

25:47.243 --> 25:49.756
    to allocate $60 million     

25:49.790 --> 25:52.807
    for the production          
      of FV-39 antiserum.       

25:59.045 --> 26:01.021
Looks like we're all            
going to live.                  

26:01.056 --> 26:03.871
Which means I'll get            
another shot at this.           

26:03.905 --> 26:06.888
        Oh, I'm sorry last night
            didn't go the way   
                 that you hoped.

26:06.922 --> 26:08.229
Eh, it's okay.                  

26:08.264 --> 26:09.939
If it was meant to be,          
it would've been.               

26:09.974 --> 26:11.214
     You know, it's funny.      

26:11.248 --> 26:13.057
  One of my daughters told me   
    yesterday morning           

26:13.092 --> 26:14.934
      that she had a dream      
      about you proposing.      

26:14.969 --> 26:17.081
So I kinda knew it wasn't going 
     to happen last night.      

26:17.115 --> 26:18.287
              Why?              

26:18.322 --> 26:21.002
When did she have me proposing? 

26:21.037 --> 26:22.210
              No.               

26:22.312 --> 26:25.261
     It wasn't about when.      

26:25.296 --> 26:27.306
You know what? Never mind.      
  Forget that I said anything.  

26:27.374 --> 26:28.915
 I promised myself I wouldn't.  

26:28.949 --> 26:30.826
Well, wait a minute. Don't      
 let me make a fool of myself.  

26:30.860 --> 26:32.235
      If there's something      
        I should know...        

26:32.302 --> 26:34.313
      No. There's nothing       
        you should know.        

26:37.231 --> 26:38.873
            (sighs):            
        I mean...               

26:38.907 --> 26:40.616
you were sad last night, right? 

26:40.651 --> 26:42.962
    We both were. We thought    
  the world was going to end.   

26:42.997 --> 26:44.471
    Okay, well, that was it.    

26:44.506 --> 26:45.779
      That was her dream.       

26:45.880 --> 26:48.494
    That she saw you getting    
        ready to propose        

26:48.530 --> 26:50.440
but instead you were sad.       

26:50.474 --> 26:52.485
    So, it already happened.    
You have nothing to worry about.

26:52.519 --> 26:54.731
            DINOVI:             
 How you doing out there?       

26:54.765 --> 26:57.245
Just getting locked and loaded. 

26:58.955 --> 27:00.397
                 I hate to leave
                    you guys,   

27:00.465 --> 27:01.705
            but I've had this   
             dinner on the books

27:01.773 --> 27:02.911
            with the head of the
                 Teacher's Union

27:02.979 --> 27:04.151
        for weeks.              

27:04.186 --> 27:05.359
          Are you sure          
    you're going to be okay?    

27:05.393 --> 27:07.035
Mm-hmm. Better than okay.       

27:07.069 --> 27:08.912
        Hi, cutes.              

27:09.013 --> 27:10.958
     Hi.                        
            So this woman I'm   
                meeting with?   

27:11.025 --> 27:12.935
        She has a reputation for
      being kind of long-winded.

27:13.037 --> 27:14.209
      I wouldn't wait up.       

27:14.244 --> 27:15.718
Hey, as soon                    
as she hits the hay,            

27:15.754 --> 27:17.730
I'm hitting the hay.            
    Uh, what else, what else?   

27:17.765 --> 27:19.373
        Uh, I've got my cell,   

27:19.441 --> 27:21.250
            the phone number for
                the restaurant's
                  on the fridge,

27:21.285 --> 27:22.458
                and, uh...      
You know what, Lynn?            

27:22.492 --> 27:24.134
          We're good.           

27:24.168 --> 27:25.508
         You just go do         
    what you gotta do.          

27:25.610 --> 27:27.151
          Okay, okay.           

27:27.185 --> 27:28.325
        I'm going.              

27:28.392 --> 27:29.531
              Mmm.              

27:29.633 --> 27:31.543
                  Okay.         
Oh, Mama.                       

27:31.644 --> 27:33.018
Oh, Mama.                       
                    Bye.        

27:33.086 --> 27:35.398
(laughs)                        
            Bye, honey. Bye.    

27:35.467 --> 27:37.477
          (whispers):           
              Bye.              

27:47.804 --> 27:51.256
      ¶ I've been working       
      on the baby bottle ¶      

27:51.324 --> 27:54.273
¶ All the live long day ¶       

27:54.342 --> 27:57.459
      ¶ I've been working       
      on the baby bottle ¶      

27:57.527 --> 27:59.840
 ¶ Just to pass the time away ¶ 

27:59.874 --> 28:01.651
         (phone rings)          

28:01.718 --> 28:04.701
        ¶ Can't you hear        
    the phone a-ringing... ¶    

28:04.735 --> 28:06.377
What do you think, little Leigh?

28:06.411 --> 28:08.892
  Should we let the answering   
    machine grab that?          

28:08.926 --> 28:10.904
    (machine clicks, beeps)     
         I'm with you.          

28:10.938 --> 28:12.244
     Hi, Lynn. It's Jenny.      

28:12.312 --> 28:13.921
    I just left this message    
          on your cell          

28:13.955 --> 28:16.401
and I called your apartment and 
 then I found this number, too, 

28:16.436 --> 28:18.916
and thought maybe I'd catch you 
     here, but I guess not.     

28:18.951 --> 28:20.928
          Anyway, uh,           
     Larry Birkbaum called.     

28:20.963 --> 28:22.939
He wanted to let you know       
 he's running a half hour late  

28:22.974 --> 28:24.784
      for dinner tonight.       
          Oh, and, uh,          

28:24.818 --> 28:26.627
he can't wait to see you.       

28:26.662 --> 28:27.834
         Okay. Thanks.          

28:27.903 --> 28:29.074
          That's all.           

28:33.769 --> 28:35.779
        (kissing)               

28:39.402 --> 28:40.877
    What was that for?          

28:40.911 --> 28:42.485
That was for                    
"I'm feeling better."           

28:42.520 --> 28:45.302
  That was for "I haven't been  
able to kiss you in days."      

28:45.403 --> 28:47.179
                    (giggles)   

28:47.214 --> 28:48.520
That was for...                 

28:48.554 --> 28:51.035
"nobody's going to get          
a deadly virus                  

28:51.069 --> 28:53.214
        "and bleed from their   
                  eyes and nose,

28:53.282 --> 28:56.265
             get things all over
            their face and die."

28:56.299 --> 28:59.283
            Not tonight, anyway.

28:59.317 --> 29:02.266
That's a good answer.           

29:02.301 --> 29:03.640
                     What a day.

29:03.709 --> 29:05.082
    Ugh.                        

29:06.189 --> 29:08.938
            How many            
almost disasters are there      

29:08.972 --> 29:10.916
that we never hear about?       

29:10.983 --> 29:13.933
Government or big business      
         don't tell us          

29:14.069 --> 29:15.375
  because they don't have to.   

29:15.409 --> 29:17.387
  Makes you grateful there are  
    people like that doctor     

29:17.421 --> 29:18.594
who was here this morning.      

29:18.628 --> 29:20.203
            Mm-hmm.             

29:24.261 --> 29:26.238
          Mmm.                  

29:26.272 --> 29:27.646
What was that one for?          

29:27.680 --> 29:29.289
                That was to hold
                me till morning.

29:29.323 --> 29:32.339
      Another good answer.      

29:34.687 --> 29:36.665
    (knocking on door)          
        WESTPHAL:               
           Come on in.          

29:37.672 --> 29:40.185
Okay, Erik, I'm here.           

29:40.220 --> 29:42.297
What's so important you needed  
to get me out of bed            

29:42.398 --> 29:43.839
at 11:30 and rush over?         

29:43.873 --> 29:47.694
     Don't get mad at me...     

29:47.730 --> 29:49.874
but I hacked into your computer.

29:49.908 --> 29:52.958
      I read your e-mail.       

29:55.038 --> 29:58.021
It's not happening, is it?      

29:58.055 --> 30:00.066
I'm sorry.                      

30:03.017 --> 30:06.000
    They don't buy it.          

30:06.034 --> 30:07.845
  They all think it's a setup.  

30:07.879 --> 30:10.493
     That maybe I'm working     
      with the government.      

30:12.506 --> 30:14.751
     So it's not happening.     

30:14.786 --> 30:17.768
Maybe you picked the wrong guy. 

30:19.546 --> 30:22.328
    I think deep down,          

30:22.395 --> 30:26.216
 I don't want to be the one who 
 sells this virus to some nuts. 

30:26.250 --> 30:29.267
     Gets a lot of innocent     
          people hurt.          

30:30.945 --> 30:33.928
        I mean...               

30:33.962 --> 30:35.973
     I'd do it if I had to.     

30:36.008 --> 30:38.990
  You think you don't have to?  

30:39.025 --> 30:42.008
You see Congress approving      
  production of our antiserum?  

30:42.076 --> 30:44.019
  Neither do I. You know why?   

30:44.088 --> 30:47.037
Because they can't see microbes.

30:47.072 --> 30:49.216
They can see planes flying      
        into buildings.         

30:49.250 --> 30:52.233
 They can see suicide bombers.  

30:52.301 --> 30:54.211
  But they can't see microbes.  

30:54.279 --> 30:57.262
(sniffling)                     

30:57.330 --> 30:59.878
                 Are you crying?

30:59.945 --> 31:02.962
    Oh, God, don't... don't cry.

31:02.997 --> 31:06.013
        I'm sorry.              

31:06.047 --> 31:08.830
          (sniffling)           

31:08.897 --> 31:10.874
 Are we going to be all right?  

31:10.909 --> 31:13.690
Are you asking me if there'll be
 money to pay for your alimony? 

31:13.725 --> 31:15.333
No.                             

31:15.434 --> 31:18.888
I'm asking you if we're         
going to be all right.          

31:23.347 --> 31:25.324
                 Come here.     

31:46.480 --> 31:49.095
  We're going to be just fine.  

31:51.107 --> 31:53.118
             Good.              

31:55.733 --> 31:56.906
             Wait, don't go yet.

31:56.940 --> 31:58.649
                  No, I want you
                    to see this.

31:58.683 --> 31:59.655
        See what?               

32:01.735 --> 32:03.143
              Me.               

32:03.177 --> 32:05.188
    Drinking the last           
    of the antiserum.           

32:05.256 --> 32:07.065
      I don't understand.       

32:07.133 --> 32:08.305
    Why are you doing that?     

32:08.340 --> 32:11.356
    Well, it's the only way     
         I can survive.         

32:13.838 --> 32:16.686
 I had to expose myself to the  
 virus in order to infect you.  

32:16.722 --> 32:18.732
     And now that I'm sure      
         you have it...         

32:18.766 --> 32:20.911
        Are you serious?        

32:20.946 --> 32:22.922
 You got about 12 hours, Mitch. 

32:22.990 --> 32:24.599
         Be a good guy.         

32:24.667 --> 32:26.611
    Go out and infect           
        lots of people.         

32:26.646 --> 32:28.455
        Or don't.               

32:28.523 --> 32:31.003
    As long as they find your   
      body covered with lesions,

32:31.071 --> 32:34.624
    blood running from your eyes
    and nose, what do I care?   

32:34.692 --> 32:36.032
          Do me favor.          

32:36.100 --> 32:38.009
Close the door on your way out. 

32:43.039 --> 32:45.016
          Mrs. Dubois.          

32:45.084 --> 32:46.793
          Come on in.           

32:47.867 --> 32:49.810
Oh, uh,                         
we better not.                  

32:49.879 --> 32:51.722
  Little bit of a cold.         

32:51.757 --> 32:53.499
It's good to see you again.     

32:53.566 --> 32:54.706
(clears throat)                 

32:54.740 --> 32:56.416
Hope you're feeling better.     

32:56.450 --> 32:58.428
                 Oh, physically,
                    much better.

33:00.003 --> 33:01.545
      Certainly busy here.      

33:01.613 --> 33:04.462
Oh, we have antiserum           
to manufacture.                 

33:04.496 --> 33:06.574
We're finally getting           
to do the work                  

33:06.642 --> 33:08.720
that we were meant to do.       

33:08.754 --> 33:11.670
      Feels good.               

33:11.738 --> 33:14.520
So, um, what can I do for you?  

33:14.554 --> 33:16.733
      Well, you can admit       

33:16.767 --> 33:19.415
    that you murdered           
    your friend, Dr. Lomis,     

33:19.449 --> 33:25.013
and that this entire panic      
about FV-39 virus is contrived. 

33:26.322 --> 33:28.500
 Why would you say that?        

33:30.715 --> 33:33.228
Why would you even think that?  

33:34.905 --> 33:36.849
 None of that is true.          

33:36.883 --> 33:38.022
     None of it.                

33:38.057 --> 33:39.866
      (coughing)                

33:43.856 --> 33:45.197
     Please, Dr. Westphal.      

33:45.231 --> 33:47.543
  We both know that it's true.  

33:47.578 --> 33:49.991
    That you are a pompous,     
         self-consumed,         

33:50.059 --> 33:52.471
      self-aggrandized man      
    who thinks he's smarter     

33:52.506 --> 33:54.618
        and knows better        
      than everybody else.      

33:54.652 --> 33:57.133
     You infected Dr. Lomis     
        with that virus,        

33:57.167 --> 34:00.049
    and you didn't even care    
     who else he infected.      

34:00.084 --> 34:01.658
    In fact, it was only due    

34:01.726 --> 34:04.173
    to Dr. Lomis's own sense    
        of decency              

34:04.241 --> 34:06.922
    that other people           
    didn't get sick and die.    

34:06.956 --> 34:09.369
Where is this coming from?      

34:09.402 --> 34:11.514
         This... story?         

34:11.549 --> 34:13.391
    It's not a story.           

34:13.426 --> 34:15.873
You know it's not a story.      

34:15.908 --> 34:18.388
 Well, can you prove any of it? 

34:22.646 --> 34:25.360
    You can't prove it          
     because it's not true.     

34:25.396 --> 34:28.210
  Just 'cause I can't prove it  
doesn't mean it's not so.       

34:28.246 --> 34:29.351
             Fine.              

34:29.386 --> 34:30.659
     Believe what you like.     

34:30.693 --> 34:32.201
    I have work to do.          

34:32.235 --> 34:33.609
    Lives to protect.           

34:34.683 --> 34:36.525
I'm going to go talk to my boss.

34:36.594 --> 34:39.141
Then I'm going to go talk       
     to that man from FEMA,     

34:39.175 --> 34:41.789
        and I'm going to tell   
            them what I know.   

34:41.857 --> 34:42.996
    And you're right.           

34:43.032 --> 34:44.773
I might not be able to prove it,

34:44.873 --> 34:47.925
but I might be able to get them 
     to take a second look      

34:47.992 --> 34:50.338
    at those appropriations     
      for your antiserum.       

34:50.373 --> 34:52.452
  I might be able to get them   

34:52.485 --> 34:55.937
    to put the brakes           
        on all of this.         

34:57.347 --> 34:59.358
     Why would you do that?     

35:01.403 --> 35:04.186
  Why would you deny hundreds   
     of thousands of people     

35:04.220 --> 35:06.934
 the chance to live in the face 
  of a potential catastrophe?   

35:06.969 --> 35:08.678
To prove what?                  

35:08.745 --> 35:11.494
To gain what?                   

35:12.669 --> 35:15.082
      Talk about pompous.       

35:15.116 --> 35:17.730
Self-aggrandized, self-consumed.

35:22.123 --> 35:24.100
(sighs)                         

35:32.349 --> 35:34.024
        (keys jangling)         

35:37.345 --> 35:39.187
                         DINOVI:
                    You're home.

35:39.255 --> 35:40.427
I wanted to surprise you.       

35:40.496 --> 35:41.501
    The baby's asleep.          

35:41.535 --> 35:42.842
     I was going to change.     

35:43.882 --> 35:45.893
    Something special?          

35:46.966 --> 35:49.379
    Uh, just things we need     
         to talk about.         

35:58.701 --> 36:00.241
     (sighs)                    

36:00.309 --> 36:01.985
      Talk.                     

36:03.897 --> 36:05.673
                I can't do it   
                      like this.

36:05.741 --> 36:07.215
                     Do you want
                      some wine?

36:07.249 --> 36:09.227
No. Let's just talk.            

36:09.261 --> 36:10.467
You got something on your mind. 

36:10.502 --> 36:11.708
I got something on my mind.     

36:11.743 --> 36:13.586
          I was asleep          
 when you got home last night.  

36:13.620 --> 36:15.463
        You were asleep         
  when I got up this morning.   

36:15.497 --> 36:17.139
 Let's just do it. Let's talk.  

36:19.689 --> 36:21.900
Okay, I'll start.               

36:22.940 --> 36:24.515
How is Larry Birkbaum?          

36:25.555 --> 36:27.130
              Wow.              

36:27.198 --> 36:29.109
        You know.               

36:30.182 --> 36:32.159
I'm a detective, Lynn.          

36:36.250 --> 36:37.758
Why is my...                    

36:39.737 --> 36:41.011
Why are you having dinner       

36:41.045 --> 36:42.922
         with a lawyer          
    who practices family law    

36:42.956 --> 36:44.765
      when you told me you      
         were working?          

36:44.800 --> 36:46.508
  I mean, this guy specializes  

36:46.543 --> 36:49.023
    in child support,           
        custody issues.         

36:49.058 --> 36:51.102
  Unless it's something else.   

36:51.170 --> 36:53.716
Maybe the two of you            
are friends.                    

36:53.751 --> 36:55.426
              No.               

37:01.898 --> 37:03.272
    What's this?                

37:03.307 --> 37:04.848
    That's my divorce.          

37:06.861 --> 37:08.871
             What?              

37:08.906 --> 37:10.145
        You're married?         

37:10.213 --> 37:11.552
                          I was.

37:11.587 --> 37:14.336
                For a minute,   
                      in my 20s.

37:14.437 --> 37:17.587
Oh, and now is probably as good 
  a time as any to tell you...  

37:17.622 --> 37:19.465
    I wasn't a virgin           
    when we first met.          

37:22.551 --> 37:24.025
                 I know I should
                    have just   

37:24.060 --> 37:25.266
    told you about it,          

37:25.334 --> 37:28.082
         but honestly,          
it meant so little to me.       

37:28.116 --> 37:29.993
     It lasted so briefly.      

37:30.027 --> 37:32.507
  And it happened so long ago.  

37:32.541 --> 37:34.720
    It was so inconsequential   
                to both of us   

37:34.787 --> 37:35.960
                  that we didn't
                     even bother

37:35.995 --> 37:38.073
            to get it taken care
                 of at the time.

37:38.107 --> 37:40.420
    And then, when you          
and I first got together,       

37:40.487 --> 37:42.397
    things were so on-again,    
        off-again.              

37:44.075 --> 37:46.353
                  But now, since
                we're on again--

37:46.388 --> 37:48.231
                     really on--

37:48.300 --> 37:50.176
                    I just...   

37:51.853 --> 37:54.199
        I hated...              

37:54.267 --> 37:56.579
I really hated keeping something
        from you.               

37:58.424 --> 38:00.871
            Also...             

38:24.943 --> 38:27.122
    It's never going to fit     
         on my finger.          

38:27.156 --> 38:29.167
        (chuckles)              
            Shut up.            

38:30.609 --> 38:31.950
        I want the knee.        

38:32.017 --> 38:33.425
    I want the whole thing.     

38:33.460 --> 38:35.236
             Okay.              

38:38.422 --> 38:40.935
But before that happens...      

38:43.048 --> 38:45.931
you're going to have to tell me 

38:45.965 --> 38:48.344
    what I'm supposed to do     
        with this.              

38:55.151 --> 38:57.128
         Okay, you win.         

38:58.873 --> 39:00.884
But I still want the knee.      

39:05.646 --> 39:07.253
         (sighs)                

39:20.430 --> 39:21.804
             Um...              

39:21.839 --> 39:26.833
unaccustomed to public speaking 
        as I am...              

39:26.868 --> 39:29.147
    God, this better get better.

39:29.214 --> 39:31.426
        (laughing)              

39:31.460 --> 39:33.337
(dog barking in distance)       

39:33.405 --> 39:35.617
                    Go to sleep.

39:35.651 --> 39:37.730
How do you know                 
I'm not sleeping?               

39:37.831 --> 39:39.774
    I'm just psychic.           

39:39.809 --> 39:42.356
Well, how am I                  
supposed to sleep               

39:42.390 --> 39:44.501
when I know...                  
I just...                       

39:44.535 --> 39:47.083
I know that                     
that evil bastard               

39:47.117 --> 39:49.362
is just sitting                 
in his house                    

39:49.397 --> 39:50.704
gloating to himself             

39:50.738 --> 39:52.480
about how he got away           
with everything.                

39:52.515 --> 39:54.325
I mean, he killed a man.        

39:54.359 --> 39:57.777
He marshaled the resources      
of an entire city--             

39:57.813 --> 40:00.997
the federal government, even--  
to get what he wanted.          

40:01.065 --> 40:03.277
            I don't know what to
              tell you, Allison.

40:03.311 --> 40:06.059
             Sometimes, you just
                have to give up.

40:06.094 --> 40:09.144
        Sometimes, you just have
        to surrender to the idea

40:09.178 --> 40:11.792
        that everything works   
                 out in the end.

40:13.135 --> 40:14.608
                That, one way   
                     or another,

40:14.643 --> 40:17.726
    life has a way of eventually
         evening everything out.

40:17.794 --> 40:20.275
              Even the gloating,
                evil bastards   

40:20.309 --> 40:22.789
                    are going to
                     get theirs.

40:22.823 --> 40:24.264
                      But it can
                     only happen

40:24.332 --> 40:26.242
                if we get a full
                  night's sleep.

40:26.276 --> 40:27.583
Are you mocking me?             

40:27.618 --> 40:30.132
            No, I'm begging you.

40:31.875 --> 40:34.155
            A grateful nation   
                    salutes you.

40:34.222 --> 40:35.563
Quiet.                          

40:35.597 --> 40:37.641
I'm trying to sleep.            

40:37.709 --> 40:39.652
 (monitor beeping rhythmically) 

40:39.687 --> 40:42.302
                            MAN:
        Good thing you called   
            911 when you did.   

40:42.336 --> 40:44.044
        (grunting)              

40:44.079 --> 40:45.888
      (labored breathing)       

40:45.956 --> 40:47.532
        (coughing)              
                            Shh.

40:47.600 --> 40:49.409
                     Just relax.

40:49.444 --> 40:51.990
                Dr. Westphal,   
            try not to speak.   

40:52.025 --> 40:54.940
     I know you're afraid,      
  but there's no reason to be.  

40:54.975 --> 40:58.596
  105 is a pretty good fever,   
      but we've seen more       

40:58.630 --> 41:00.472
    than a few patients come    
    through our doors           

41:00.575 --> 41:02.283
    with this very same flu     
        you have,               

41:02.351 --> 41:04.026
 and everyone's pulled through. 

41:04.095 --> 41:05.870
         We've just got         
     to keep you hydrated,      

41:05.939 --> 41:07.949
keep your electrolytes balanced,

41:07.983 --> 41:09.927
      and the medications       
      we're giving you...       

41:09.962 --> 41:12.978
    I'm betting we're looking   
              at 102 by morning.

41:20.858 --> 41:22.399
MAN:                            
Me?                             

41:22.467 --> 41:24.142
I'm betting 107.                

41:24.177 --> 41:26.456
But then your physician         
doesn't know you                

41:26.524 --> 41:28.031
as well as I do.                

41:28.099 --> 41:29.440
    He doesn't know you had     

41:29.475 --> 41:32.760
      an allergic reaction      
    to that antiserum.          

41:32.794 --> 41:35.777
  Sure, it cured the disease,   

41:35.811 --> 41:39.967
      kept you from dying       
  of viral hemorrhagic fever,   

41:40.001 --> 41:43.488
but we always knew              
a tiny part of the populace     

41:43.556 --> 41:45.633
would react badly               
to it.                          

41:45.668 --> 41:49.052
Which is why, when you          
felt that first itch            

41:49.087 --> 41:51.031
at the back                     
of your throat,                 

41:51.065 --> 41:53.110
must have been                  
a surprise, huh?                

41:53.177 --> 41:54.786
You didn't wait.                

41:54.821 --> 41:58.038
You gave yourself               
a massive dose of steroids      

41:58.072 --> 41:59.781
to halt the reaction.           

41:59.850 --> 42:03.268
Because you knew better.        

42:03.335 --> 42:07.594
    You were one step ahead,    
        as always.              

42:09.304 --> 42:13.863
     But you never counted      
          on the flu.           

42:13.897 --> 42:16.410
And now, with your immune system

42:16.478 --> 42:20.032
     completely compromised     
    by those steroids,          

42:20.066 --> 42:25.396
      your body has no way      
        to fight it off.        

42:25.430 --> 42:30.257
  You might as well have FV-39  
      or the black plague,      

42:30.291 --> 42:33.006
  for all the immune response   
        you can muster.         

42:35.320 --> 42:37.666
There you go.                   

42:37.735 --> 42:39.711
You go to sleep.                

42:39.780 --> 42:42.797
For the very last time.         

42:42.831 --> 42:45.143
That's right, Erik.             

42:45.178 --> 42:48.328
You are going to die.           

42:49.401 --> 42:51.479
        You know,               

42:51.547 --> 42:55.100
    I'd kiss you good night     
          if I could.           

42:55.169 --> 42:59.392
        But, hey,               
you can't have everything.      

42:59.459 --> 43:01.504
             Whoa.              

43:02.947 --> 43:04.119
    You okay?                   

43:04.154 --> 43:05.996
Everything all right?           

43:06.065 --> 43:08.209
                     It's better
                 than all right.

43:08.277 --> 43:09.953
             Everything's great.

43:16.022 --> 43:18.267
