CHIN:
<i> Previously on</i> Hawaii Five-O...

00:03.437 --> 00:05.170
Chin, what's the matter?
You know this guy?

00:05.172 --> 00:07.006
Yeah, his name
is Gabriel Waincroft.

00:07.008 --> 00:08.541
<i> He's my brother-in-law.</i>

00:08.542 --> 00:10.075
What I should do is throw you
off this damn roof!

00:10.076 --> 00:11.609
I should do the same to you
for not protecting my sister.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.278
(grunts)

00:13.280 --> 00:15.647
You murdered my father,
you son of a bitch.

00:15.649 --> 00:17.082
Tell me why!

00:17.084 --> 00:18.317
(doorbell rings)
Delivery.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.754
STEVE:<i> You see, this is</i>
<i> a chess game to him.</i>

00:21.756 --> 00:25.224
He just sent us a very clear
message that he is moves ahead.

00:25.226 --> 00:28.627
I'd like to, uh, introduce you
to Inspector Abby Dunn.

00:28.629 --> 00:30.329
San Francisco PD
is putting together

00:30.331 --> 00:31.463
a task force

00:31.465 --> 00:32.464
Aloha.

00:32.466 --> 00:34.066
Hi.

00:34.068 --> 00:35.367
I like you, Chin, I...

00:35.369 --> 00:37.669
(gentle laugh)
I really like you.

00:37.671 --> 00:39.271
I like you, too, Abby.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.639
But I'd much rather have
this conversation in person.

00:40.641 --> 00:43.642
Except I'm in San Francisco
right now.

00:43.644 --> 00:44.777
Work stuff.

00:50.785 --> 00:53.252
Okay, it's-it's all there.

00:53.254 --> 00:54.420
Let me see my brother now.

00:54.422 --> 00:56.622
Deal's a deal.

00:56.624 --> 00:57.756
(exhales) Matty.

00:57.758 --> 01:00.225
Matty, it's me.

01:01.429 --> 01:02.728
Want to take him with you?

01:02.730 --> 01:04.463
Or would you prefer
that we ship him?

01:09.570 --> 01:10.736
There's my boy!

01:10.738 --> 01:12.571
Come here.
Mama!

01:12.573 --> 01:13.739
Hey, Ma.
Hello, handsome.

01:13.741 --> 01:16.341
Mm, so good to see you.

We all deserve nice things.

01:38.365 --> 01:42.267
An escape from the bland,
the mundane, the vanilla.

01:42.269 --> 01:45.204
What you've seen here today
can be your escape.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.239
The Mau Loa Vacation Club
is offering

01:47.241 --> 01:50.676
an exclusive opportunity

01:56.750 --> 01:58.383
He's very good.

01:58.385 --> 02:00.486
Yeah, yeah, he's great.

02:00.487 --> 02:02.588
You know, "timeshare ownership"
is kind of like an oxymoron.

02:02.590 --> 02:04.790
(laughs) You know, you basically
get a fancy hotel room

02:04.792 --> 02:06.658
with a mortgage payment--
that's all it is.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.127
Does someone have a question?

02:08.129 --> 02:10.696
No, no, my husband
was just remarking

02:10.698 --> 02:13.799
on how beautiful
the place is.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.701
Mr. Williams.
Hmm?

02:15.703 --> 02:17.236
Let me paint this
picture for you.

02:17.238 --> 02:18.871
Okay.
The sun's

02:18.873 --> 02:20.672
melting into the Pacific.

02:20.674 --> 02:23.408
You've got a bottle of Domaine
Chandon Etoile Rosé on ice,

02:23.410 --> 02:25.777
and this beautiful wife of yours

02:25.779 --> 02:27.513
in your arms.

02:27.515 --> 02:30.249
Can you imagine anything
more romantic than that?

02:30.251 --> 02:31.951
No, no.

02:31.952 --> 02:33.652
You-you can put the paintbrush
down for a second.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.188
Honey, I need to speak
to you alone if that's...

02:36.190 --> 02:38.190
No, no, don't be rude,
sweetheart. It's okay.

02:38.192 --> 02:39.791
Just-just carry on.
We're re... we're good.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.360
Clara, now.
I need to speak,

02:41.362 --> 02:43.428
I got to speak to her right now,
you understand, right?

02:43.430 --> 02:44.863
See? Come on.
Excuse us.

02:44.865 --> 02:46.398
We'll be right back.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.500
Sorry.
Promise.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.768
Ma?
Yeah?

02:49.770 --> 02:50.903
Make it stop.
It's over.

02:50.905 --> 02:52.237
Please, I don't want
to do it anymore.

02:52.239 --> 02:53.906
You promised.
Yeah, I did. I promised.

02:53.908 --> 02:55.440
I promised that
I would pretend I was Dad

02:55.442 --> 02:56.775
so you could get
tickets to a cruise.

02:56.777 --> 02:57.876
To where, I have no idea.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.511
Okay, but you-you
promised me

02:59.513 --> 03:00.646
that it would
only take one hour.

03:00.648 --> 03:01.914
We've been here
for four hours.

03:01.916 --> 03:02.948
Four hours is nothing.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.349
Do you know how long

03:04.351 --> 03:05.884
I was in labor with you?

03:05.886 --> 03:07.886
36 hours!
Mm.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.188
Not to mention,
every Saturday,

03:09.190 --> 03:10.322
all those Little League
tournaments.

03:10.324 --> 03:11.523
Remember those?

03:11.525 --> 03:13.692
Driving all over
the tri-state area?

03:13.694 --> 03:15.894
I sacrificed for you.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.863
So man up and pretend
that we're married,

03:17.865 --> 03:21.433
because I am not leaving here
without that cruise-- got it?

03:21.435 --> 03:22.534
Mm-hmm, I got it.

03:22.536 --> 03:23.735
You're gonna be on a cruise,

03:23.737 --> 03:24.937
I'm gonna be in therapy, Ma.
About time.

03:24.939 --> 03:26.205
Ma...?

03:28.876 --> 03:30.943
(tires screeching)

03:45.826 --> 03:48.560
(onlookers murmuring)

03:53.367 --> 03:56.368
(grunting with effort)

03:58.672 --> 03:59.838
(gasping)

03:59.840 --> 04:01.807
Fix him.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.609
Please?

<i> (Hawaii Five-O </i>

04:34.575 --> 04:35.941
Hey, what do we got?

04:35.943 --> 04:38.010
So, our victim's a John Doe.

04:38.012 --> 04:40.045
He was brought in DOA, multiple
gunshot wounds to the chest.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.747
What about the guy
who brought him in?

04:41.749 --> 04:43.448
His name is Neil Palea.

04:43.450 --> 04:44.549
CSU swabbed his hands.

04:44.551 --> 04:45.851
No trace of GSR.

04:45.853 --> 04:47.352
Doesn't look like
he's our shooter.

04:47.354 --> 04:48.720
Well, what's his connection
to the vic?

04:48.722 --> 04:50.622
Mm, he wouldn't tell me.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.324
What, he's refusing
to cooperate?

04:52.326 --> 04:53.892
Not exactly.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.961
(indistinct page
over intercom)

04:58.332 --> 05:00.399
(rapid scratching)

05:01.568 --> 05:02.734
Hey, Neil...

05:02.736 --> 05:06.405
this is Commander
Steve McGarrett.

05:06.407 --> 05:08.907
Remember I told you
about him?

05:12.046 --> 05:14.479
He needs to ask you
a few questions, okay?

05:15.449 --> 05:16.915
My uniform is stained!

05:16.917 --> 05:18.317
I can't show up
for work like this.

05:18.319 --> 05:20.585
I need to go home and change!

05:20.587 --> 05:22.587
Okay.

05:22.589 --> 05:24.656
No problem.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.393
"Neil" like Neil Armstrong?

05:28.395 --> 05:30.562
First man on the moon.

05:30.564 --> 05:31.963
Commander Armstrong's left boot

05:31.965 --> 05:34.766
hit the lunar surface
at precisely 2:56

05:34.768 --> 05:35.934
Coordinated Universal Time.

05:35.936 --> 05:38.003
Yes, sir.

05:38.005 --> 05:41.406
"One small step for man,
one giant leap for mankind."

05:41.408 --> 05:43.041
"One small step for<i> a</i> man."

05:43.043 --> 05:45.444
Acoustic analysis confirmed
the missing syllable.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.446
Really?

05:47.448 --> 05:49.748
Did you know that?

05:49.750 --> 05:50.749
No.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.017
I didn't know that, either.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.386
Huh.

05:54.388 --> 05:57.556
You know, Neil, I really
just wanted to, uh,

05:57.558 --> 06:01.493
ask you about the guy you
brought into the hospital today.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.662
Was he a friend of yours?

06:07.568 --> 06:09.034
What was his name?

06:10.637 --> 06:11.636
Mark.

06:11.638 --> 06:13.138
Mark. Huh.

06:13.140 --> 06:14.973
Thank you.

06:16.009 --> 06:19.044
(rapid scratching)

06:19.046 --> 06:20.045
You know what
his last name was?

06:20.047 --> 06:21.880
I already told you his name.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.482
We're late for work.

06:24.451 --> 06:25.951
Oh, you and Mark
worked together?

06:26.987 --> 06:29.054
Ah, where was that?

06:34.161 --> 06:37.129
Hey, Neil, Mark was,
Mark was hurt.

06:37.131 --> 06:39.631
Real bad. He died.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.633
And I want to find
the person who did it,

06:41.635 --> 06:44.569
so I need you to tell me
what you saw.

06:45.773 --> 06:47.873
Do you know who hurt Mark?

06:50.811 --> 06:52.978
Okay, Neil, that's okay.

06:57.184 --> 06:59.451
(indistinct page over intercom)

07:02.790 --> 07:05.424
Neil came to us
about five years ago

07:05.426 --> 07:07.426
after his mother
passed away.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.661
He's highly functioning
and capable of a lot,

07:09.663 --> 07:12.831
but like anyone
on the spectrum,

07:12.833 --> 07:14.599
he's had his difficulties.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.568
Social interaction,
for example.

07:16.570 --> 07:17.936
Neil doesn't
really have friends.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.772
That's why Mark was
so important to him.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.875
You know,
I'm wondering if, uh,

07:23.877 --> 07:27.212
the reality of Mark's death
has actually sunk in yet.

07:27.214 --> 07:28.513
Well, Neil

07:28.515 --> 07:29.681
processes trauma

07:29.683 --> 07:31.817
differently than you and I.

07:31.819 --> 07:33.785
His routine is very
important to him.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.654
And Mark was part
of that routine.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.989
Every day, Neil would
take the bus to Mark's house

07:37.991 --> 07:40.091
and they would drive
to work together.

07:40.093 --> 07:42.093
And on Saturdays,

07:42.095 --> 07:43.728
they'd play Konane.

07:43.730 --> 07:46.932
A disruption of that
routine may be

07:46.934 --> 07:48.533
more difficult for him
than Mark's death.

07:48.535 --> 07:49.734
Hey, Neil.

07:49.736 --> 07:53.071
You know, Janet was just
telling me that, uh,

07:53.073 --> 07:57.008
you go by Mark's house
every morning before work.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.810
Did you go there today?

07:58.812 --> 08:00.679
Yes.

08:00.681 --> 08:02.547
He was hurt.
Yeah.

08:02.549 --> 08:04.216
Yeah.

08:04.218 --> 08:05.851
Can you take me
to Mark's house?

08:05.853 --> 08:07.085
No.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.987
I'm one hour and 47 minutes
late for work.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.922
I'm gonna be in trouble.
Neil...

08:10.924 --> 08:12.858
Remember what we talked about.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.092
Sometimes schedules

08:14.094 --> 08:15.861
can change.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.863
Now, Commander McGarrett
needs your help.

08:17.865 --> 08:18.830
No.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.198
No! I have to leave!

08:20.200 --> 08:22.167
I have to close P-2 at 9:00 p.m.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.635
Very important!

08:23.637 --> 08:24.903
How about this, Neil?
What if we make a deal?

08:24.905 --> 08:27.772
What if you show me
where Mark's house is,

08:27.774 --> 08:31.209
and I promise you I will get you
to work before 9:00 p.m.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.948
Number six bus.

08:36.950 --> 08:39.818
Okay.

08:47.094 --> 08:49.127
At the coffee shop,
make a right.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.897
It's the house
with the blue mailbox.

08:51.899 --> 08:53.064
Blue mailbox.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.132
<i> All right, buddy.</i>

09:08.882 --> 09:11.049
Hey, Kono, uh, stay
with Neil for a minute?

09:11.051 --> 09:13.118
Yeah, copy that.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.141
Five-O!

09:49.790 --> 09:50.822
Clear!

09:50.824 --> 09:51.890
Clear.

09:53.226 --> 09:54.726
CHIN:
Valuables are untouched.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.161
This wasn't a robbery.

09:56.163 --> 09:58.196
It was an execution.

10:00.667 --> 10:03.068
Vic's name is Mark Walker.

10:03.070 --> 10:04.936
Looks like he was
heading to Los Angeles.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.005
And he was planning
on taking Neil with him.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.710
One way tickets
purchased this morning.

10:11.712 --> 10:14.713
These guys were in a hurry
to get out of town.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.781
Yeah, but who
were they running from?

10:26.393 --> 10:28.360
(sirens wailing,
helicopter flying over)

10:40.140 --> 10:41.373
Neil, how you doing?
You okay?

10:41.375 --> 10:43.375
You promised you would
take me to work.

10:43.377 --> 10:44.909
You can't break a promise!

10:44.911 --> 10:46.778
Nope. No, you're right.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.213
I'm not gonna
break a promise, Neil.

10:48.215 --> 10:49.781
We're gonna go to work, okay?

10:49.783 --> 10:50.882
We're going to work.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.684
I just, I gotta
ask you one question.

10:52.686 --> 10:55.754
Did Mark say anything about you
guys going to Los Angeles today?

10:55.756 --> 10:57.989
No, no more questions.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.958
You told me you would
take me to work.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.826
Okay, all right.

11:01.828 --> 11:02.961
Okay, let's go
to work, Neil.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.295
Come on.

11:04.297 --> 11:05.830
Let's get you
to work, buddy.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.298
Okay.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.300
All right?

11:09.302 --> 11:11.970
Neil, I gotta just say good-bye
to my friends over here.

11:11.972 --> 11:14.305
Is that okay?

11:14.307 --> 11:15.907
Okay?

11:22.082 --> 11:23.748
Um...

11:23.750 --> 11:24.833
All right, we get
anything else on the vic?

11:24.834 --> 11:25.917
Yeah, we found out
that Mark has an ex-wife

11:25.919 --> 11:27.085
and a daughter on the island.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.420
We'll reach out,
see if they know anything.

11:28.422 --> 11:29.754
Yeah, but until
we find out

11:29.756 --> 11:31.056
who murdered Mark
or what he was into,

11:31.058 --> 11:32.757
we're gonna have to assume
that Neil's in danger.

11:32.759 --> 11:34.059
All right.

11:34.061 --> 11:35.894
Look, I promised I'd
take him to work, okay?

11:35.895 --> 11:37.728
So I'm gonna... I'm gonna hang
with him for a while tonight,

11:37.731 --> 11:40.331
see if I can maybe
build up some trust.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.866
Maybe he'll tell
me a few things

11:41.868 --> 11:43.802
and fill in the blanks, you know?
CHIN: Yeah.

11:45.305 --> 11:46.438
Why does the crime scene
clean-up guy

11:46.440 --> 11:47.706
look like Gerard Hirsch?

11:47.708 --> 11:50.208
CHIN: Because it is
Gerard Hirsch.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.309
Hirsch, what are you doing?

11:51.311 --> 11:52.977
What-what is this?

11:52.979 --> 11:55.213
Well, since you took away my
livelihood, I've had to adapt.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.882
After seeing how busy
you all were,

11:57.884 --> 12:01.352
I figured I should, uh, feed
off the teat, as they say.

12:01.354 --> 12:02.887
Thanks for that image.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.389
Charming.
Mm.

12:04.390 --> 12:05.890
STEVE: I see you've been
in business since '82, huh?

12:05.892 --> 12:08.226
There's nothing wrong
with a little white lie.

12:08.228 --> 12:11.830
My customers like to feel that
they're in experienced hands.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.298
Ah, instead of the hands
of an ex-art-forger-

12:13.300 --> 12:14.799
turned-Waikiki-
caricature-artist.

12:14.801 --> 12:17.135
I don't see your better half.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.804
Where is the lovely
Inspector Abigail Dunn?

12:19.806 --> 12:21.439
Don't tell me you two
have broken up already.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.274
She's in San Francisco
on business.

12:23.276 --> 12:24.476
And don't change
the subject.

12:24.478 --> 12:25.844
How did you know
that we were here?

12:25.846 --> 12:27.312
I got a police scanner.

12:27.314 --> 12:29.380
The early bird gets
the blood splatter.

12:29.382 --> 12:30.799
It's "spatter."

12:30.800 --> 12:32.217
Whatever.
Point me to the carnage.

12:32.219 --> 12:33.351
STEVE:
Yeah, uh, early bird.

12:33.353 --> 12:34.786
You're too
early, okay?

12:34.787 --> 12:36.220
CSU hasn't even finished
processing the scene.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.289
When they finish,
we'll call you, okay?

12:38.291 --> 12:39.357
(car honks twice)

12:40.427 --> 12:41.426
Who's the new guy?

12:41.428 --> 12:42.427
I got to go, all right?

12:42.429 --> 12:43.428
Yeah, me too.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.763
All right.

12:44.765 --> 12:46.765
Well, uh,
give me a call

12:46.767 --> 12:49.334
when the place is
ready to be cleaned.

12:49.336 --> 12:53.271
Or for any other, uh...
needs you may have.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.907
Are you implying
sexual needs, Gerard?

12:55.909 --> 12:57.909
Um, sure.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.844
I'll pass.

12:59.846 --> 13:01.212
For now.

13:04.384 --> 13:07.385
I don't know how many
ways I can say no.

13:07.387 --> 13:09.387
He-he just
doesn't listen.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.256
I know, they're all the same,
they're all the same.

13:11.258 --> 13:12.390
They lure you in
with a prize,

13:12.392 --> 13:13.858
and then they hit you
with the hard sell.

13:13.860 --> 13:16.427
Mr. and Mrs. Williams,
it's your lucky day.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.797
(clears throat) I bet. I just got
off the phone with my manager.

13:18.799 --> 13:21.800
and he's agreed to release
that primo third-floor unit

13:21.802 --> 13:23.501
at a special
discounted rate.

13:23.503 --> 13:26.204
But we need to lock
this deal up tonight.

13:26.206 --> 13:29.340
Okay, look, um, uh, we really
appreciate the effort.

13:29.342 --> 13:31.142
Uh, you're doing
a fantastic job.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.560
The pocket square's phenomenal.

13:32.561 --> 13:33.977
But, anyway, we're not gonna...
No timeshare.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.480
We're not gonna get
involved in it,

13:35.482 --> 13:37.816
uh, today,
tomorrow, anytime.

13:37.818 --> 13:39.150
No timeshare.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.152
So, uh, if we could get
those cruise tickets

13:41.154 --> 13:43.154
and end this very long day,
that would be fantastic.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.489
Mr. Williams...

13:44.491 --> 13:47.892
it's clear to me why
your wife loves this place.

13:47.894 --> 13:52.463
She's a sophisticated woman
with impeccable taste.

13:52.465 --> 13:55.166
Mmm. Do you really want
to disappoint her?

13:55.168 --> 13:57.602
If we get the cruise tickets,
yes, I can live with that.

13:57.604 --> 13:59.537
I have to say, I am surprised.

13:59.539 --> 14:02.173
Mmm. I mean, you struck
me as a kind of man

14:02.175 --> 14:05.476
who would do anything
to keep his wife happy.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.979
I mean, think about it,
Mrs. Williams.

14:07.980 --> 14:10.481
(sighs) Every morning, waking
up with the Pacific Ocean

14:10.483 --> 14:12.667
calling out
to greet you.

14:12.668 --> 14:14.852
The warm, salty air
tickling your naked skin.

14:14.855 --> 14:16.187
Okay, that's enough.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.422
That's my mother.
No more, okay?

14:17.424 --> 14:18.874
What?

14:18.875 --> 14:20.325
DANNY: (clears throat) Yeah,
my dad couldn't make the trip.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.327
It's not a big deal,
but that's that.

14:22.329 --> 14:23.995
It's, uh, it was
all a sham, okay?

14:23.997 --> 14:25.563
It's over now.
CLARA: Daniel.

14:25.565 --> 14:26.564
What?
Seriously?

14:26.566 --> 14:27.866
Uh-huh.

14:27.868 --> 14:30.134
But you still have money, right?

14:33.106 --> 14:35.640
We split up
about six months ago.

14:35.642 --> 14:38.509
Mark had a bad
gambling problem.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.545
He bounced around jobs
for a little while,

14:40.547 --> 14:42.547
and that's why he ended
up working at the garage

14:42.549 --> 14:43.882
a year and a half ago.

14:43.884 --> 14:46.551
(sniffles) No one
else would hire him.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.586
Did he ever talk about Neil?

14:48.588 --> 14:51.923
Yeah, they were pretty close.

14:51.925 --> 14:54.592
He liked the fact that
Neil didn't judge people.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.261
Mm.

14:56.263 --> 14:58.263
Did he ever mention
anything about taking Neil

14:58.265 --> 14:59.964
on a trip to Los Angeles?

14:59.966 --> 15:01.966
Not to me.
(sniffles)

15:01.968 --> 15:04.135
We were barely in touch
until a week ago.

15:04.137 --> 15:05.603
And what happened a week ago?

15:05.605 --> 15:07.605
Mark showed up.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.140
Wanted to tell me
about some trust

15:09.142 --> 15:10.642
that he was setting up
for our daughter.

15:12.479 --> 15:13.812
(clears throat)

15:13.813 --> 15:15.146
Ma'am, if you don't
mind my asking,

15:15.148 --> 15:17.015
how much money did
he leave your daughter?

15:17.017 --> 15:19.350
Well, I haven't gotten
any paperwork yet,

15:19.352 --> 15:22.487
but, knowing Mark, it couldn't
have been that much.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.489
GROVER:
Ooh, boy, was his ex-wife wrong.

15:24.491 --> 15:26.357
I looked into that trust.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.993
Mark wired a hundred grand
into his daughter's account.

15:28.995 --> 15:30.328
STEVE: All right, well,
that's a lot of money

15:30.330 --> 15:32.330
for a guy who makes
12 bucks an hour.

15:32.332 --> 15:35.033
Maybe... maybe he's coming off
a big gambling win or something.

15:35.035 --> 15:37.468
Uh, no chance, his ex-wife said
he was addicted.

15:37.470 --> 15:40.371
If he was still in the game,
he'd be in it till he was broke.

15:40.373 --> 15:41.372
Okay, well, wherever
he got that money,

15:41.374 --> 15:42.707
it could be what got him killed.

15:42.708 --> 15:44.041
GROVER:
All right, I'll call you back.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.313
What's going on, Neil?

15:48.315 --> 15:51.516
It's 8:58, and it takes me
two minutes to walk down to P-2

15:51.518 --> 15:53.251
and set up the cones.

16:04.531 --> 16:06.431
What's going on, Neil?
Why are you closing this down?

16:06.433 --> 16:09.100
NEIL: I can't
talk about it.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.570
I have to go.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.472
They're gonna be here.
Who's gonna be here?

16:40.633 --> 16:43.634
Neil, who are you
waiting for?

16:43.636 --> 16:46.170
Mark said not to
talk about it.

16:46.172 --> 16:48.239
It's top secret.

16:50.176 --> 16:51.709
Okay.

17:17.604 --> 17:19.670
♪ ♪

17:37.157 --> 17:39.223
♪ ♪

17:54.407 --> 17:56.474
♪ ♪

18:05.685 --> 18:07.351
Well, I'm impressed.

18:07.353 --> 18:08.686
This definitely
took some skill.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.354
Yeah, whoever
did this

18:10.356 --> 18:11.522
tunneled at least
20 yards,

18:11.524 --> 18:12.690
then had to get
through three feet

18:12.692 --> 18:13.858
of steel-reinforced
concrete,

18:13.860 --> 18:15.226
and that was
before they got

18:15.228 --> 18:16.661
to the five inches
of solid steel.

18:16.663 --> 18:17.695
(groans)

18:17.697 --> 18:19.697
You said nothing
was taken?

18:19.699 --> 18:21.232
Cash is all
accounted for.

18:21.234 --> 18:24.569
Safety deposit boxes
were all untouched.

18:24.571 --> 18:27.405
They literally walked in,
hit the emergency release,

18:27.407 --> 18:28.706
and walked right
out the door.

18:28.708 --> 18:32.110
Who breaks into a vault
to get inside a bank?

18:35.248 --> 18:37.248
As crazy as it sounds,
it does make sense.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.716
See, our security office
is right outside the vault.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.718
From there,
you can shut down

18:40.720 --> 18:42.820
the bank's entire alarm
system without tripping

18:42.822 --> 18:44.555
any surveillance cameras
or motion sensors.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.574
Yeah, all right,
Mr. Fuller,

18:46.575 --> 18:48.592
we're gonna need to see all the,
uh, security footage, please.

18:48.595 --> 18:49.460
That's not possible.

18:50.430 --> 18:51.429
The thieves deleted it.

18:51.431 --> 18:53.281
Right.

18:53.282 --> 18:55.132
Well, do either of you have
any idea what they were after?

18:55.135 --> 18:57.802
We have customer
records and files,

18:57.804 --> 18:59.470
but we checked, and
everything's accounted for.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.205
What about the
private offices?

19:01.207 --> 19:03.341
Miss Koha and I
checked both ours.

19:03.343 --> 19:04.909
Nothing's been disturbed.

19:04.910 --> 19:06.476
And the employees
in all the other offices

19:06.479 --> 19:07.678
say nothing's missing.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.347
Okay, and how
many people know

19:09.349 --> 19:10.615
about the security
layout in here?

19:10.617 --> 19:13.317
Maybe a dozen people.

19:13.319 --> 19:14.452
All right, we're gonna need
to question all of them.

19:14.454 --> 19:15.786
We're also gonna
need full inventory

19:15.788 --> 19:17.355
of-of the bank offices.

19:17.357 --> 19:18.222
Of course.

19:18.224 --> 19:19.357
Hey, guys.

19:19.358 --> 19:20.491
Yeah, uh, keep us
posted, please.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.828
So it looks like Mark
used his key card

19:23.830 --> 19:25.496
to let the crew in
every night at 9:00 p.m.

19:25.498 --> 19:26.664
for the last six nights.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.633
Any cameras in the garage?

19:28.634 --> 19:30.601
Yeah, but every night from
8:55 p.m. to 5:00 a.m.,

19:30.603 --> 19:33.204
the cameras at the entrance and
on P-2 were conveniently down.

19:33.206 --> 19:35.540
I think I might have an idea
where Mark got the money

19:35.542 --> 19:36.874
for his daughter's trust.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.509
Right, he was
their inside man.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.244
For 100K, he gave 'em
access to the garage

19:40.246 --> 19:41.913
and a guarantee that
he would look the other way

19:41.915 --> 19:44.149
when they dug their tunnel.

19:44.150 --> 19:46.384
Probably made assurances that
he could keep Neil quiet too.

19:46.386 --> 19:48.252
I'm thinking, at some point,
Mark must have realized

19:48.254 --> 19:49.720
that he and Neil
were both loose ends

19:49.722 --> 19:52.356
and that the crew was gonna clip
them once the job was done.

19:52.358 --> 19:55.226
Which is why Mark wanted
to skip town with Neil.

19:55.228 --> 19:56.494
All right.

19:56.496 --> 19:57.662
Am I in trouble?

19:57.664 --> 19:59.664
No, no, you're not
in trouble.

19:59.666 --> 20:01.666
You were given a set
of instructions,

20:01.668 --> 20:03.401
you followed them,
end of story.

20:03.403 --> 20:04.735
What story?

20:04.737 --> 20:06.571
KONO: Uh, no,
what he means is--

20:06.573 --> 20:08.573
that's it, there's
nothing more to say.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.374
Then why don't you say that?

20:10.376 --> 20:12.510
I don't know.

20:12.512 --> 20:13.678
I, uh...

20:13.680 --> 20:14.812
I don't know,
you're right.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.731
Neil, you're right,

20:16.732 --> 20:18.649
and-and I... and from now on,
I will say that.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.985
But right now, we need to ask
you about the guys

20:20.987 --> 20:23.254
who have been coming
here every night.

20:23.256 --> 20:25.256
I'm not supposed
to talk about it.

20:25.258 --> 20:27.258
Yeah, I know, I know,
but, you see, the thing is

20:27.260 --> 20:28.392
we really need you to.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.394
KONO: Neil,
we think those are

20:30.396 --> 20:32.663
the same men
who killed Mark.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.865
We need to find them before
they hurt someone else.

20:34.867 --> 20:37.335
Are they gonna hurt me?

20:37.337 --> 20:38.502
No. No, no, no, no.

20:38.504 --> 20:40.187
No one's gonna hurt you, Neil.

20:40.188 --> 20:41.871
No one's gonna hurt you,
but, uh, you see,

20:41.874 --> 20:43.674
the thing is you're the only
one who's seen them,

20:43.676 --> 20:45.776
so we need your help.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.778
Can you tell us how many
of them there were?

20:49.682 --> 20:51.149
Four.

20:51.150 --> 20:52.617
Okay. All right.
Do you know their names?

20:52.619 --> 20:54.418
No.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.954
Can you describe
what they look like?

20:56.956 --> 20:59.457
He broke the rules.

20:59.459 --> 21:00.825
Who broke the rules?

21:00.827 --> 21:02.526
Every night he'd smoke
in the stairwell.

21:02.528 --> 21:05.396
I told him once,
"It's not allowed."

21:05.398 --> 21:07.031
He got very angry.

21:07.032 --> 21:08.665
After that, Mark said
I should not talk to him.

21:08.668 --> 21:11.002
Okay, can you tell us
what that man looked like?

21:11.004 --> 21:13.337
(groans) STEVE: It's okay.

21:14.574 --> 21:16.474
What about the cigarettes
he smoked, Neil?

21:16.476 --> 21:19.343
Can you tell us what kind
of cigarettes he smoked?

21:32.325 --> 21:34.325
I-I picked them up
after my shift,

21:34.327 --> 21:36.394
but I didn't
throw them away.

21:36.396 --> 21:38.362
I thought someone could
see them and report it.

21:38.364 --> 21:40.064
Yep, well, you did the right
thing. Can I have those?

21:40.066 --> 21:41.699
Thank you.
Thank you.

21:41.701 --> 21:43.401
Would you get these
to Eric right away,

21:43.403 --> 21:44.502
see if he can pull
some DNA?

21:44.504 --> 21:46.437
Mm-hmm.

21:46.439 --> 21:47.438
You did real
good, Neil.

21:47.440 --> 21:48.873
You did real good.

21:55.548 --> 21:57.481
Thanks, Ma.

22:00.520 --> 22:01.552
It's, uh...

22:01.554 --> 22:03.654
it's an interesting, um...

22:03.656 --> 22:05.690
sandwich there, Ma.

22:05.692 --> 22:07.491
There's no, uh,
there's no condiments--

22:07.493 --> 22:08.659
no mustard, no mayo.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.428
You didn't, uh,

22:10.430 --> 22:12.797
cut off the crust,
like you know I like.

22:12.799 --> 22:13.864
Ma?

22:17.503 --> 22:18.469
I see.

22:18.471 --> 22:19.704
You're, uh, you're upset with me

22:19.706 --> 22:21.472
'cause I blew the,
uh, cruise tickets

22:21.474 --> 22:22.973
and now you're giving me
the silent treatment, right?

22:22.975 --> 22:26.010
Just stealing a page out of
your playbook, sweetheart.

22:26.012 --> 22:27.011
What-what does that mean?

22:27.013 --> 22:28.546
Well, when you were growing up

22:28.548 --> 22:30.014
and I did something
that you didn't like,

22:30.016 --> 22:31.382
you froze me out.

22:31.384 --> 22:34.385
Right. I-I mean,
I was a little child.

22:34.387 --> 22:35.386
You're an adult woman.

22:35.388 --> 22:36.387
It's very mature, though.

22:36.389 --> 22:38.389
Yes, well, how does it feel?

22:38.391 --> 22:39.490
How does it feel?

22:39.492 --> 22:40.691
I don't know.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.526
Definitely doesn't
taste good, though.

22:42.528 --> 22:44.662
(knocking at door)

22:44.664 --> 22:45.863
Detective Williams.

22:45.865 --> 22:46.997
Yeah.

22:46.999 --> 22:48.566
I'm Special Agent Kang
with the FBI.

22:48.568 --> 22:49.667
I'd like to speak
to your mother Clara.

22:51.537 --> 22:52.954
About the timeshare?

22:52.955 --> 22:54.372
No, it's about your brother
Matthew.

22:54.374 --> 22:56.374
My brother Matthew?

22:56.376 --> 22:57.909
Matthew's been dead
for over a year.

22:57.910 --> 22:59.443
What, uh, what do you want
to talk to my mom for?

22:59.445 --> 23:01.645
Just need to ask her
a few questions.

23:03.149 --> 23:04.515
Uh, okay, uh...

23:04.517 --> 23:06.550
but now is, um,
not a good time.

23:06.552 --> 23:07.551
My-my kids are
on their way over.

23:07.553 --> 23:09.787
Later today is fine.

23:09.789 --> 23:10.788
See you then.

23:10.790 --> 23:12.056
All right.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.124
Give you a call.

23:15.928 --> 23:17.428
Do you have any idea why

23:17.430 --> 23:18.896
the FBI would want to talk
to you about Matty?

23:18.898 --> 23:19.930
Matty?
Uh-huh.

23:19.932 --> 23:21.499
No, I have no idea.

23:24.904 --> 23:25.970
All right.

23:35.515 --> 23:37.181
Okay.

23:37.183 --> 23:39.850
One orange soda
with a blue straw.

23:41.621 --> 23:43.621
I like your models.

23:43.623 --> 23:44.755
Thank you.

23:47.660 --> 23:50.661
You know, I, uh, I actually
served on this one a few times.

23:50.663 --> 23:52.797
The USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

23:52.799 --> 23:54.465
Got a lot of fond memories.

23:54.467 --> 23:55.800
We called her the Big E.

23:55.802 --> 23:57.835
Oh. That was her nickname.

23:57.837 --> 24:00.638
You know, Neil, you probably
already know this,

24:00.640 --> 24:04.008
but this ship was
a tracking station for...

24:04.010 --> 24:05.576
For the<i> Friendship 7 </i>
space capsule.

24:05.578 --> 24:07.445
It was used in
the third Mercury mission.

24:07.447 --> 24:09.847
Astronaut John Glenn was
the pilot, and on that mission

24:09.849 --> 24:11.749
became the first American
to orbit the Earth.

24:11.751 --> 24:13.050
That's right, Neil.

24:16.522 --> 24:17.721
Can I pick it up?

24:17.723 --> 24:18.789
You're supposed
to ask permission

24:18.791 --> 24:19.790
before you touch
someone's things.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.859
Yeah. Yeah.

24:21.861 --> 24:23.461
Have at it.

24:28.100 --> 24:30.100
That's pretty cool, huh?

24:30.102 --> 24:31.535
(knocking on glass)

24:31.537 --> 24:33.704
Hey. Our stairwell smoker.

24:33.706 --> 24:34.872
We got an I.D. on him.

24:34.874 --> 24:37.508
All right. (sighs)

24:37.510 --> 24:39.610
Hey, Neil, can you, uh...

24:39.612 --> 24:40.811
can you do me a favor?

24:43.716 --> 24:46.016
Okay, so, Eric processed
the cigarette butts

24:46.018 --> 24:47.651
that Neil collected.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.520
We got a DNA hit
on this guy--

24:49.522 --> 24:51.222
Tyson Vargas.

24:51.224 --> 24:53.591
He did two years
at Halawa for robbery.

24:53.593 --> 24:55.659
Was paroled
six months ago.

24:56.896 --> 24:58.596
Hey, Neil, is that the guy

24:58.598 --> 25:03.000
that, uh, that you saw smoking
in the stairwell?

25:04.704 --> 25:06.904
Yeah.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.949
Clear.

25:20.820 --> 25:22.653
CHIN:
Nothing to indicate

25:22.655 --> 25:23.988
they fought back.

25:23.990 --> 25:25.222
These guys
were taken by surprise.

25:25.224 --> 25:26.724
I got Vargas over here.

25:26.726 --> 25:28.726
Neil said there were four men.

25:28.728 --> 25:31.862
I'm thinking this is
the entire heist crew.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.163
Or maybe there's
a fifth man

25:33.165 --> 25:34.698
and this is
a double-cross.

25:34.700 --> 25:36.700
If not, then whatever
they stole from the bank

25:36.702 --> 25:37.735
really pissed somebody off.

25:44.677 --> 25:45.943
Liver temperature puts TOD

25:45.945 --> 25:47.278
at approximately
11:00 a.m. this morning.

25:47.280 --> 25:49.747
As for the cause
of death, well...

25:49.749 --> 25:52.116
that should appear obvious.

25:52.118 --> 25:53.684
Additionally, our
victims suffered

25:53.686 --> 25:55.019
extreme abrasions

25:55.021 --> 25:56.871
and various
premortem contusions.

25:56.872 --> 25:58.722
Well, if they were tortured
before they were executed,

25:58.724 --> 26:00.324
maybe they already
gave up what they stole.

26:00.326 --> 26:01.959
You know what, that supports
your fifth member

26:01.961 --> 26:04.061
of the crew theory, and if
that's the case, that means

26:04.063 --> 26:06.030
Neil still might be in danger.
Kono, do me a favor.

26:06.032 --> 26:07.898
Take him back
to his apartment

26:07.900 --> 26:10.200
and have HPD put a full
security detail on the place

26:10.202 --> 26:12.169
until all this is done.
Copy that.

26:12.171 --> 26:14.939
Max, we gotta I.D. these guys
right now, please.

26:16.576 --> 26:18.108
MAX: Sam Liliha.

26:18.844 --> 26:21.045
Leo Cruz.

26:21.047 --> 26:23.681
And finally,
we have Paul Koha,

26:23.683 --> 26:25.783
in our system
for armed robbery

26:25.785 --> 26:27.117
and aggravated
assault.

26:27.119 --> 26:29.019
Paul Koha.
You recognize that name?

26:29.021 --> 26:30.054
STEVE: Yeah, the assistant
manager at the bank,

26:30.056 --> 26:31.956
Ella Koha.

26:31.958 --> 26:33.357
Well, I'm guessing
that's not a coincidence.

26:35.161 --> 26:37.044
STEVE:
Ella, your brother

26:37.045 --> 26:38.928
was part of the crew
that robbed your bank.

26:38.931 --> 26:41.231
All right? Which means you
had to have been involved.

26:41.233 --> 26:43.100
(crying):
It wasn't like that.

26:43.102 --> 26:44.268
(mock crying):
It wasn't?

26:44.270 --> 26:46.070
(gruffly):
Then tell us how it was.

26:47.006 --> 26:48.856
I found out

26:48.857 --> 26:50.707
that Mr. Fuller was
laundering money for a client.

26:50.710 --> 26:51.842
Which client?

26:51.844 --> 26:53.310
I don't know. I swear.

26:53.312 --> 26:55.079
The funds
were spread out

26:55.081 --> 26:57.014
across dozens of
falsified accounts.

26:57.016 --> 26:59.216
I found out he was
keeping records

26:59.218 --> 27:03.220
and account numbers
in his office safe.

27:03.222 --> 27:06.090
I told my brother about it

27:06.092 --> 27:08.659
and he said we'd be
taking money from someone

27:08.661 --> 27:10.160
who probably stole it
themselves.

27:11.631 --> 27:13.197
No one would get hurt.

27:13.199 --> 27:15.165
We could drain the accounts

27:15.167 --> 27:17.101
and my manager, Mr. Fuller,

27:17.103 --> 27:19.236
wouldn't be able
to report it to the police.

27:19.238 --> 27:20.771
Well, that explains why

27:20.773 --> 27:22.106
they ignored
all that cash in the vault.

27:22.108 --> 27:23.374
They'd have
to carry all that money.

27:23.375 --> 27:24.641
The account numbers
would be worth more.

27:24.644 --> 27:26.410
How much money

27:26.412 --> 27:29.046
did your brother
and his crew steal, Ella?

27:29.048 --> 27:31.915
$94 million.

27:33.285 --> 27:35.319
Where's the money now?

27:35.321 --> 27:38.155
I transferred it
to an offshore account.

27:38.157 --> 27:40.391
All right.

27:40.393 --> 27:43.427
So whoever executed the crew

27:43.429 --> 27:46.296
is looking for that money.

27:50.703 --> 27:52.236
Was Mark a bad person?

27:55.875 --> 27:58.142
No.

27:58.144 --> 28:00.377
Sometimes people
make bad decisions.

28:00.379 --> 28:03.147
It doesn't
change the fact

28:03.149 --> 28:04.348
that Mark
was your friend

28:04.350 --> 28:06.684
and that he
cared about you.

28:11.791 --> 28:13.190
STEVE:
Wait a minute.

28:13.192 --> 28:15.259
What could the FBI
possibly want with your mother?

28:15.261 --> 28:16.927
I have no idea.

28:16.929 --> 28:18.262
Why do you think
I'm calling you?

28:18.264 --> 28:19.363
Did you ask her?
Of course I asked her.

28:19.365 --> 28:20.831
What kind of
stupid question is that?

28:20.833 --> 28:22.199
Whoa!
Why you getting mad at me?

28:22.201 --> 28:24.201
'Cause I don't have time
for the obvious, okay?

28:24.203 --> 28:25.736
I gotta drop my mom at the Feds

28:25.738 --> 28:27.304
in 20 minutes and
I have no idea why.

28:27.306 --> 28:28.305
Stop. You want me
to come down there?

28:28.307 --> 28:29.406
I'll come down there, all right?

28:29.408 --> 28:30.908
No, that's very nice of you,

28:30.910 --> 28:32.242
but you got your hands full.

28:32.244 --> 28:33.293
Hey, you know what?

28:33.294 --> 28:34.343
You could use
those-those cruise tickets

28:34.346 --> 28:35.479
and flee the island. Huh?

28:35.481 --> 28:37.047
That's very funny, Steve.

28:37.049 --> 28:38.499
I actually would do that,

28:38.500 --> 28:39.950
except for the fact that
I didn't get the cruise tickets.

28:39.952 --> 28:42.786
Hey, well, listen, I-I gotta go.

28:42.788 --> 28:45.122
Before my mom ends up on
<i> America's Most Wanted.</i>

28:45.124 --> 28:47.257
Okay, listen, you need me,
I'm here, all right?

28:47.259 --> 28:48.225
Thank you very much.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.229
Yo.

28:52.231 --> 28:53.864
APB is out on Fuller.

28:53.866 --> 28:56.200
We got units stationed
at his home and at the bank.

28:56.202 --> 28:57.234
The thing is,

28:57.236 --> 28:59.470
his car is parked at his house

28:59.472 --> 29:01.305
and his cell phone
has been turned off.

29:01.307 --> 29:02.873
Seems he knows
we're looking for him.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.308
Well, we're not the only ones.

29:04.310 --> 29:06.310
I mean, whoever Fuller was
laundering money for

29:06.312 --> 29:08.345
is now out, just under 100 mil,

29:08.347 --> 29:10.314
so I'm pretty sure they'd like
a word with him, too.

29:10.316 --> 29:12.750
Ah! Aloha, colleagues!

29:12.752 --> 29:14.284
That's a stretch. Hirsch,
what are you doing?

29:14.286 --> 29:16.120
You're not supposed to be here.

29:16.122 --> 29:18.088
Rules are meant to be broken.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.290
I've spent my entire
life in an industry

29:20.292 --> 29:21.792
where conventional wisdom

29:21.794 --> 29:23.527
is constantly challenged
by the avant-garde.

29:23.529 --> 29:24.928
What are you talking about?

29:24.930 --> 29:28.265
I'm not really sure,
to be honest.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.267
But I-I did find something

29:30.269 --> 29:32.302
that might interest you.

29:32.304 --> 29:35.272
First, I need to know
that I'm "your guy."

29:35.274 --> 29:38.308
I wet your beak,
you'll wet mine.

29:38.310 --> 29:40.010
Just to be clear,

29:40.012 --> 29:42.412
did you just threaten
to withhold evidence

29:42.414 --> 29:44.414
unless we give you
a "first call" guarantee?

29:44.416 --> 29:45.783
Is that what just happened here?

29:45.785 --> 29:47.818
Your words. Not-not mine.

29:47.820 --> 29:49.019
Well, here's
a few more words:

29:49.021 --> 29:50.387
obstruction of justice.

29:52.024 --> 29:53.257
Message received.

29:53.259 --> 29:55.159
Good.
Um...

29:55.161 --> 29:59.129
While I was cleaning
the Tyson Vargas crime scene,

29:59.131 --> 30:02.266
I discovered this laptop.

30:02.268 --> 30:04.268
The lid was closed.

30:04.270 --> 30:06.336
Your geek squad just dusted it.

30:06.338 --> 30:09.273
Got some unusable partials,

30:09.275 --> 30:13.177
but the real prize was
inside the Cracker Jack box.

30:13.179 --> 30:14.278
What does that even mean?

30:14.280 --> 30:16.113
Check it out.

30:16.115 --> 30:17.981
On the outside, spotless.

30:17.983 --> 30:19.383
But inside...

30:19.385 --> 30:22.085
beaucoup blood.

30:22.087 --> 30:24.955
That computer was open
when that crew was executed.

30:24.957 --> 30:26.557
CHIN:<i> So the shooter comes in</i>
<i> looking for his money.</i>

30:26.559 --> 30:29.026
<i> He checks the laptop</i>
<i> and sees a zero balance.</i>

30:29.028 --> 30:30.678
STEVE:
<i> Right, which means</i>

30:30.679 --> 30:32.329
there could be some
usable prints on this thing.

30:32.331 --> 30:34.331
Yeah. I'll have the lab process
the inside of the laptop.

30:34.333 --> 30:36.967
Oh, I hate saying this:
Good work, Hirsch.

30:36.969 --> 30:39.469
Oh, what do you know-- a compliment.
GROVER: Hey...

30:39.471 --> 30:41.405
HPD just grabbed Fuller
at the airport.

30:41.407 --> 30:43.340
They're bringing him in.
All right, good.

30:47.580 --> 30:50.447
Mrs. Williams,
on April 19, 2011,

30:50.449 --> 30:52.416
agents from the New Jersey
field office

30:52.418 --> 30:54.017
paid you a visit.
Your son Matthew

30:54.019 --> 30:56.320
had been on the run
for months and the FBI

30:56.322 --> 30:58.255
wanted to know if he had
made contact with you.

30:58.257 --> 31:02.226
Right. And I'll tell you
what I told the agents then.

31:02.228 --> 31:05.963
I had not spoken to Matty
for well before he disappeared.

31:05.965 --> 31:09.099
Are you aware that lying
to a federal agent is a felony?

31:12.304 --> 31:13.403
(sighing): What...

31:13.405 --> 31:14.671
What-what-what is this?

31:14.672 --> 31:15.938
Ask your mother.
She should recognize it.

31:15.941 --> 31:17.441
It's a bank statement

31:17.443 --> 31:19.977
showing a balance
of nearly $50,000.

31:19.979 --> 31:21.945
Okay. So what?

31:21.947 --> 31:23.447
Detective, your brother
opened this account

31:23.449 --> 31:25.449
in your mother's name
after he became a fugitive.

31:25.451 --> 31:27.985
We've been monitoring
it ever since.

31:27.987 --> 31:30.187
We had no proof that she
was aware of the account

31:30.189 --> 31:31.388
until a couple
weeks ago,

31:31.390 --> 31:33.457
when she withdrew $700

31:33.459 --> 31:35.058
to purchase a plane ticket
to Hawaii.

31:35.060 --> 31:36.627
Mrs. Williams,
the only way

31:36.629 --> 31:38.428
you'd have known
about this account

31:38.430 --> 31:40.264
is if you had been in contact
with your son.

31:40.266 --> 31:41.932
That's not true.

31:41.934 --> 31:43.467
Then how do you explain this?

31:43.469 --> 31:45.535
Because a couple of months
after we lost Matty,

31:45.537 --> 31:48.906
the bank called and told me
about the account.

31:48.908 --> 31:51.308
I don't know when
he deposited the money

31:51.310 --> 31:53.644
or how he even got it.

31:53.646 --> 31:55.245
I only used it
so that I could come

31:55.247 --> 31:56.480
and visit my son
and my grandchildren.

31:56.482 --> 31:57.948
All right, Ma,
you don't have to say

31:57.950 --> 31:59.483
anything else.
Look, she didn't know.

31:59.485 --> 32:01.118
I'll pay back the $700.

32:01.120 --> 32:03.086
That's it,
we'll call it a day, okay?

32:03.088 --> 32:04.388
While that's
a generous offer, Detective,

32:04.390 --> 32:06.373
it doesn't
change the fact

32:06.374 --> 32:08.357
that we can still arrest your mother
for obstructing justice. What...

32:08.360 --> 32:10.694
For... A-Are you
kidding me? My...

32:10.696 --> 32:12.329
This case
should have been closed

32:12.331 --> 32:14.197
when my brother was murdered.
What-what is... what is...

32:14.199 --> 32:16.033
what's going on?
What is this about?

32:16.035 --> 32:18.535
Mrs. Williams,
I'd like a minute with your son.

32:18.537 --> 32:20.704
You're free to go.

32:20.706 --> 32:22.973
No, I-I'll walk her out.
Come on.

32:31.183 --> 32:33.250
I'm so sorry.
Ma, not here. Come on.

32:35.621 --> 32:37.721
You would have
made me turn him in.

32:37.723 --> 32:39.523
I know, I know.
It's okay.

32:39.525 --> 32:41.358
I would have done the same thing
if it had been you.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.360
I know. You did
the right thing, okay?

32:43.362 --> 32:44.561
And I promise I would have done

32:44.563 --> 32:46.663
the same thing.
It's okay, Ma, come here.

32:46.665 --> 32:48.598
I love you.
I love you too.

32:50.469 --> 32:51.969
STEVE: Okay, one more
time, Mr. Fuller--

32:51.971 --> 32:53.370
Who were you laundering

32:53.372 --> 32:55.405
the money for?

32:57.009 --> 33:00.177
Okay, when you were planning
your little getaway,

33:00.179 --> 33:03.447
our techs did some digging
into the bank security system.

33:03.449 --> 33:05.115
GROVER: You know,
they found out, apparently,

33:05.117 --> 33:06.416
you were telling
the truth about

33:06.418 --> 33:07.417
the surveillance video
being scrubbed.

33:07.419 --> 33:09.486
What you neglected
to mention

33:09.488 --> 33:11.421
was that you were
the one that scrubbed it.

33:11.423 --> 33:13.457
Almost three hours
after the break-in.

33:13.459 --> 33:15.158
STEVE: Right, you saw
the video of the break-in.

33:15.160 --> 33:16.526
You recognized
Ella's brother.

33:16.528 --> 33:18.462
Then you send somebody
to execute him and his crew

33:18.464 --> 33:20.063
and get the money back.

33:21.467 --> 33:23.000
I want a lawyer.

33:23.002 --> 33:24.167
Oh, he wants a lawyer.

33:24.169 --> 33:25.569
GROVER:
Oh, well, the best lawyer

33:25.571 --> 33:26.770
in the world ain't gonna
keep you from spending

33:26.772 --> 33:28.605
the rest
of your life in jail.

33:28.607 --> 33:30.340
(lock buzzes, clicks)

33:30.342 --> 33:32.009
Guys...

33:38.484 --> 33:40.317
Crime lab got a print
off that laptop.

33:40.319 --> 33:42.452
Belongs to Gabriel Waincroft.

33:57.569 --> 33:58.635
(grunts)

33:59.772 --> 34:02.506
Lucky day!

34:02.508 --> 34:03.707
This is gonna go quicker
than we thought.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.275
All right,
so we now know

34:05.277 --> 34:06.710
that you've been laundering
money for Gabriel Waincroft,

34:06.712 --> 34:08.779
which means we also
understand why you haven't been

34:08.781 --> 34:11.314
telling us anything,
because you're scared of him.

34:11.316 --> 34:13.183
GROVER:
And you should be.

34:13.185 --> 34:15.085
So, go ahead, you can play
tough guy with us all you want.

34:15.087 --> 34:16.854
He's gonna kill you.

34:16.855 --> 34:18.622
STEVE: He's gonna kill you.
Soon as he finds you.

34:18.624 --> 34:21.258
And even jail won't
protect you from that.

34:21.260 --> 34:22.759
STEVE:
He's right.

34:22.761 --> 34:25.462
Unless we get
to him first, though.

34:25.464 --> 34:27.330
How do you think
you're gonna do that, huh?

34:27.332 --> 34:30.200
Well, that's
where you come in to it.

34:30.202 --> 34:32.636
GABRIEL:
Where the hell have you been?

34:32.638 --> 34:35.205
Tracking down your cash.

34:35.207 --> 34:36.540
My assistant manager Ella
has it.

34:36.542 --> 34:37.607
Where is she now?

34:37.609 --> 34:39.109
I just spoke to her.

34:39.111 --> 34:40.143
She's at home.

34:40.145 --> 34:41.645
Send me her address.

34:41.647 --> 34:43.380
I can get your money

34:43.382 --> 34:45.348
and I can meet you
anywhere you want.

34:45.350 --> 34:47.484
That's not necessary.

34:47.486 --> 34:50.520
Just give me the address.

34:50.522 --> 34:52.589
I have everything under control.

35:00.199 --> 35:02.199
I'm not gonna let you guys
use me as bait.

35:02.201 --> 35:03.767
Okay, Ella, the guy
you stole from,

35:03.769 --> 35:05.435
uh, he knows who you are.

35:05.437 --> 35:07.437
And he can
get to you anywhere.

35:07.439 --> 35:09.372
You want to stay alive,
you help us catch him.

35:09.374 --> 35:10.507
Steve...

35:10.509 --> 35:12.576
I got her.

35:20.185 --> 35:21.968
I think she's right.

35:21.969 --> 35:23.752
Listen, no one wants
to catch Gabriel more than I do.

35:23.755 --> 35:25.589
But we ran this play
once before,

35:25.591 --> 35:27.457
and the bait ended up
getting stabbed 28 times.

35:27.459 --> 35:29.426
We're tracking Gabriel.

35:29.428 --> 35:30.861
We got a lock on his cell.
I say we go in now.

35:30.863 --> 35:32.462
That's too risky.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.231
That's too many variables
that we can't control.

35:34.233 --> 35:36.433
All right?
But we bring him to us,

35:36.435 --> 35:39.436
we have the tactical advantage.

35:39.438 --> 35:40.670
(engine revving)

35:48.514 --> 35:50.280
All right, Kono,
we're in position.

35:50.282 --> 35:51.515
KONO:
All good here.

35:51.517 --> 35:53.150
ETA on Gabriel?

35:53.151 --> 35:54.784
He's heading south on Punahou,
a block away from King.

35:54.786 --> 35:56.219
Should have visual

35:56.221 --> 35:58.388
in a few seconds.

35:58.390 --> 35:59.756
Hold on, guys.

35:59.758 --> 36:01.558
The signal just went dark.

36:02.494 --> 36:04.561
Hey, if Gabriel
killed his phone,

36:04.563 --> 36:06.730
that means he must know
he's walking into a trap.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.800
KONO:
Guys,

36:10.802 --> 36:13.803
I have a visual on our target
and four hostiles

36:13.805 --> 36:16.773
moving on your location
from the east side.

36:18.911 --> 36:20.411
Gabriel knows we're here.

36:20.412 --> 36:21.912
STEVE: All right, Kono, hold
your position. Copy that.

36:23.582 --> 36:24.998
Lock yourself in the bathroom,

36:24.999 --> 36:26.415
lie down in the tub
and stay there.

36:26.418 --> 36:27.617
No matter what
happens out here,

36:27.619 --> 36:29.653
don't come out
unless I tell you.

36:29.655 --> 36:31.421
Guys, we're gonna go
floor by floor,

36:31.423 --> 36:33.290
split this building into thirds,
shoot anything that moves.

36:43.368 --> 36:45.569
(gunfire)

37:12.431 --> 37:15.332
(gunfire)

37:38.724 --> 37:41.424
Don't do it.

37:41.426 --> 37:42.492
Don't do it!

38:08.053 --> 38:10.720
(grunting)

38:32.911 --> 38:34.344
(gunshot)

38:39.584 --> 38:40.817
(cracking)

39:00.572 --> 39:01.838
Aah!

39:03.542 --> 39:04.607
(gunshot)

39:11.416 --> 39:13.683
Girl... I love you!

39:13.685 --> 39:15.685
Love you, too.

39:25.430 --> 39:27.530
(grunting)

39:53.725 --> 39:56.726
(grunting)

40:22.621 --> 40:24.788
(grunting)

40:41.940 --> 40:43.873
Hey.

40:43.875 --> 40:45.108
(weakly):
Hey...

40:45.110 --> 40:47.444
You okay?

40:47.446 --> 40:49.479
(panting):
I will be.

40:49.481 --> 40:51.114
Where is he?
Where's Gabriel?

40:53.151 --> 40:54.517
He's where he belongs.

41:08.700 --> 41:11.801
You... have been asking me...

41:11.803 --> 41:13.803
the same exact questions

41:13.805 --> 41:14.904
for the last two hours.

41:14.906 --> 41:18.107
My answers are
not gonna change, okay?

41:18.109 --> 41:20.143
I was not in contact
with my brother

41:20.145 --> 41:22.045
and I did not
help him in any way.

41:22.047 --> 41:23.580
I find that hard to believe.

41:23.582 --> 41:25.982
Yeah, I know. You and
your brother were close.

41:25.984 --> 41:27.984
In fact, you were the last
person to see Matt

41:27.986 --> 41:29.869
before he fled the country.

41:29.870 --> 41:31.753
And with all the resources
at your disposal

41:31.756 --> 41:33.056
as a member of Five-O,

41:33.058 --> 41:34.991
you'd have done
everything in your power

41:34.993 --> 41:36.726
to locate
and assist your brother.

41:36.728 --> 41:37.827
Mm.

41:37.829 --> 41:39.062
Right.

41:39.064 --> 41:41.064
Smile all you like,
Detective Williams.

41:41.066 --> 41:42.232
We both know it's true.

41:42.234 --> 41:44.000
No, I'll tell you
what we both know:

41:44.002 --> 41:46.569
is that you, my friend,
just showed your hand.

41:46.571 --> 41:48.104
This is not ab... about
a bank account.

41:48.106 --> 41:49.239
Someone's pulling
the strings here,

41:49.241 --> 41:51.774
I'm just...
I'm just not sure who.

41:51.776 --> 41:53.977
This is definitely not about
my brother; it's about me,

41:53.979 --> 41:56.079
it's about Five-O, it's about
the people that I work with.

41:56.081 --> 41:57.146
Am I right?

41:58.917 --> 41:59.916
Hmm?

41:59.918 --> 42:01.651
It's okay. Don't answer.

42:02.687 --> 42:03.887
Hey.

42:06.758 --> 42:08.825
(over speaker): You. You got
something you want to ask me,

42:08.827 --> 42:11.127
just come on out, ask me, okay?

42:12.998 --> 42:14.264
ABBY:
This isn't going anywhere.

42:14.266 --> 42:16.199
Maybe not.

42:16.201 --> 42:18.801
But this task force
has crossed the line before

42:18.803 --> 42:20.803
and they will again.

42:20.805 --> 42:24.207
You just need to be
there when it happens.

42:24.209 --> 42:26.276
Yes, sir.

42:31.983 --> 42:33.850
You all right?

42:33.852 --> 42:35.852
Yeah, I'll make it.

42:35.854 --> 42:38.321
(panting)

43:02.814 --> 43:04.280
We had him.
