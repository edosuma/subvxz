WEBVTT

00:10.927 --> 00:16.016
Okay, this is everything to sign,
wherever there's a tag, and we're done.

00:18.935 --> 00:19.769
[sighs]

00:32.574 --> 00:34.242
Oh, come on, Lisa. Don't--

00:34.325 --> 00:36.077
How am I going to know where to sign?

00:37.203 --> 00:39.789
You're delaying the divorce
by making it harder for me to sign.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.082
You get that, right?

00:42.125 --> 00:44.878
-Is this even legal?
-To remove the tabs?

00:45.003 --> 00:45.837
Yeah.

00:49.799 --> 00:50.842
Are you okay?

00:51.259 --> 00:54.304
Oh. You don't have to worry
about me anymore, you're free.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.765
You can move on with your life.

00:57.390 --> 00:58.641
I know I am.

00:59.517 --> 01:00.560
Peace!

01:02.312 --> 01:03.188
[clears throat]

01:16.993 --> 01:20.914
Pretty devastating for me, but I guess
for you it's just another Tuesday.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.458
Oh, I wish it was Wednesday.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.460
That much closer to the weekend.

01:29.297 --> 01:30.548
[theme music plays]

01:41.226 --> 01:42.602
[grunting]

01:43.895 --> 01:44.938
Alright, you can hit me.

01:45.021 --> 01:46.606
-You know you can hit me. Oh!
-No.

01:46.689 --> 01:47.941
Yes! Right in the nuts!

01:48.024 --> 01:50.777
Below the belt!
That grazed my dick a little bit.

01:50.860 --> 01:52.112
Can I interrupt for a minute?

01:52.195 --> 01:55.198
Oh, yeah, if this is about the pillows,
that was totally his idea.

01:55.281 --> 01:56.241
It wasn't.

01:56.324 --> 01:57.784
-It wasn't--
-Come on. You were like,

01:57.867 --> 02:00.286
"Let's do the pillow fight."
and I was like, "No, dude, don't."

02:00.370 --> 02:02.872
Of course it's wonderful
to have this energy here.

02:03.039 --> 02:05.583
Listen, I'm hosting
a small dinner party tonight

02:05.667 --> 02:08.878
and I have some friends that I would love
you to meet. But I know it's last minute,

02:08.962 --> 02:10.839
so I won't be offended
if you can't make it.

02:10.922 --> 02:12.423
Yeah. I'll swing by.

02:12.507 --> 02:15.677
Oh, wonderful. I'm, uh... I'm so pleased.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.137
-7:00?
-Yeah.

02:17.220 --> 02:19.806
-You need me to bring anything?
-Oh, no, it's not necessary.

02:19.889 --> 02:20.890
It's being catered.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.685
-But if the spirit moves you.
-Okay.

02:23.768 --> 02:25.436
Are your friends into onion dip?

02:27.021 --> 02:27.856
Um...

02:28.273 --> 02:30.024
Oh. [laughs]

02:30.108 --> 02:33.153
Yes. Actually they prefer
jalapeño poppers.

02:33.236 --> 02:34.487
[laughing]

02:34.571 --> 02:36.573
Alright. Okay.

02:36.948 --> 02:38.533
Sure. Done and done.

02:38.616 --> 02:39.617
[heels clacking]

02:42.620 --> 02:44.080
Hiya, big boy.

02:45.790 --> 02:46.916
Charlie?

02:54.507 --> 02:55.341
[passes gas]

03:01.848 --> 03:04.100
-[gasps]
-Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.727
I was trying to surprise you.

03:05.810 --> 03:08.688
Mission accomplished.
What's with the trench coat?

03:08.771 --> 03:11.691
-Oh, shit!
-Oh, this old thing?

03:11.774 --> 03:15.153
Was this gonna be a sexy surprise thing?
I've always had that fantasy.

03:15.236 --> 03:17.989
Oh. Then you were gonna
be disappointed anyway.

03:18.406 --> 03:19.324
Ta-da!

03:19.824 --> 03:22.577
-What is this?
-I wanna join you for weekend soccer.

03:22.952 --> 03:25.622
But you always make fun of me
and my friends for that shit, remember?

03:25.705 --> 03:31.085
-"Enjoy your recess"?
-I want to enjoy recess as well.

03:31.294 --> 03:33.129
Don't you want me
to play soccer with you?

03:33.213 --> 03:36.507
-You're always saying.
-Yes! I'm so pumped, really?

03:36.591 --> 03:37.467
-Yeah!
-Oh!

03:38.051 --> 03:39.969
-Oh.
-Jogo bonito.

03:41.137 --> 03:44.557
-What does that mean?
-The beautiful game, try it.

03:44.641 --> 03:47.393
-Oh, okay.
-Jogo bonito!

03:47.477 --> 03:48.770
Jogo bonito!

03:48.853 --> 03:50.480
[trills tongue]

03:50.855 --> 03:52.690
Jon took the kids this morning

03:52.774 --> 03:54.067
for his half of the week.

03:54.150 --> 03:57.654
And I'm going to be at home without them
for the first time ever.

03:57.737 --> 03:59.322
How do you feel about that?

03:59.781 --> 04:02.492
It's gonna be a ghost town.
Should I stay in?

04:02.575 --> 04:05.203
I mean, if I stay in,
it's gonna be depressing.

04:05.411 --> 04:06.871
Should I go out?

04:07.705 --> 04:09.040
Crash a book club?

04:09.123 --> 04:11.000
Book a hotel with Ethan?

04:11.918 --> 04:14.587
Is that something you've been considering?

04:14.671 --> 04:16.422
What? No! It was a joke.

04:16.506 --> 04:20.009
Do they beat the sense of humor out of you
in your PhD program?

04:22.804 --> 04:25.223
I'm just trying to figure out
what to do tonight.

04:26.015 --> 04:28.518
Oh, you know what?

04:28.810 --> 04:31.187
That's what you can tell me,
is what to do tonight.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.274
Is it possible
that you're transferring your anxiety

04:34.357 --> 04:37.318
about your separation
onto your plans for this evening?

04:37.527 --> 04:39.445
[imitates buzzer] Wrong answer.

04:39.529 --> 04:40.446
In or out?

04:41.447 --> 04:43.116
Out. In.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.953
Out, in, out, in, out...

04:47.328 --> 04:48.371
In!

04:48.454 --> 04:49.455
Stay in.

04:50.790 --> 04:51.833
You  would  say that.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.167
[sighs]

04:55.128 --> 04:57.255
Guy walks into a therapist's office.

04:57.338 --> 04:59.549
"Am I a teepee or a wigwam?

05:00.008 --> 05:02.760
Am I a teepee or a wigwam?
Am I a teepee, am I a wigwam?

05:02.844 --> 05:04.220
Am I a teepee or a wigwam?"

05:04.971 --> 05:07.056
Therapist says, "You're too tense."

05:08.141 --> 05:08.975
What?

05:10.601 --> 05:13.938
Well, just earlier you had said
I didn't have a sense of humor.

05:14.355 --> 05:16.899
I love jokes. I mean, jokes can be
a kind of therapy.

05:16.983 --> 05:20.403
I just don't often bring them
into my practice, but...

05:20.820 --> 05:22.071
I really...

05:22.613 --> 05:24.324
believe in their power...

05:25.825 --> 05:27.076
to heal.

06:15.291 --> 06:18.169
Hey, Marianne. What are you up to tonight?

06:22.131 --> 06:23.883
Max. I don't know Max. I don't know.

06:23.966 --> 06:25.718
It feels... kinda young.

06:25.802 --> 06:28.054
You said young and hip.
That's why we came to this store.

06:28.137 --> 06:30.640
-So, wait a second. This is cool?
-Yeah, it's fast fashion.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.558
You just wear it for as long as it's cool,

06:32.642 --> 06:34.727
and then you throw it away
and you destroy the Earth.

06:35.311 --> 06:38.356
-Are the pants shorts?
-Are they shorts or pants?

06:38.439 --> 06:41.234
Can I-- Excuse me.
You know how young these kids are?

06:41.651 --> 06:44.404
-Gray hair is cool.
-You know, I like this sweater.

06:44.487 --> 06:47.448
-You know, I like this-- It's so tight.
-You look like a French sailor.

06:47.532 --> 06:50.243
You know, Max, it feels really soon
for me to be dating again.

06:50.326 --> 06:52.703
I literally just signed my divorce papers.

06:52.787 --> 06:54.664
After beating yourself up for like a year.

06:54.747 --> 06:57.041
If it helps,
don't think about it as a date.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.001
-Okay?
-Yeah, that's good, because I can't.

06:59.085 --> 07:01.170
I can't think about it as a date,
it terrifies me.

07:01.254 --> 07:05.049
Alright, think about it, we're going out
to dinner with one of my clients.

07:05.133 --> 07:08.761
It's just so exhausting, Max.
To tell all of your old stories again

07:08.845 --> 07:10.054
to a complete stranger.

07:10.555 --> 07:13.099
Dead man's shoes? Who wants to hear
dead man's shoes again?

07:13.182 --> 07:15.393
I wanna hear dead man's shoes.
I love that story.

07:15.476 --> 07:17.395
Could hear that a thousand times,
it's one of your best.

07:17.478 --> 07:19.063
No, no, no.

07:19.147 --> 07:20.398
-I love that-- I do love--
-No!

07:20.481 --> 07:22.066
-It's a good story.
-No, that hat!

07:22.150 --> 07:25.403
I do not want to date in a world
where a person can wear that hat.

07:25.486 --> 07:27.488
It's Max Moda by Justin Theroux.

07:27.572 --> 07:28.906
He's really cool.

07:29.740 --> 07:31.742
-Jesus Christ.
-It looks good in the mirror.

07:31.826 --> 07:32.743
Put it away.

07:33.828 --> 07:37.081
What do you think?
Does this look like a double XL to you?

07:37.165 --> 07:39.250
I don't know what size it is,
but it's the right one.

07:39.333 --> 07:41.043
The war's over. Slim cut won.

07:41.127 --> 07:44.714
-I look like a white sausage.
-I feel like it's very slimming.

07:44.797 --> 07:46.966
You're right. No, you're right.
This is it. I like it.

07:47.049 --> 07:49.343
-What's not to like? You look fantastic.
-I'm gonna take it.

07:49.427 --> 07:51.429
-Good.
-And it's only $5.

07:51.512 --> 07:53.306
-Great.
-Sold. We're good.

07:55.683 --> 07:57.435
-It was too tight.
-Yeah.

07:57.518 --> 07:59.479
But it looks good in front now.

07:59.729 --> 08:02.398
That's what it needed.
Now you just throw on a blazer.

08:03.900 --> 08:08.029
-Jogo bonito!
-[all]  Jogo bonito!

08:09.614 --> 08:11.199
What's up?

08:11.657 --> 08:12.909
[cheering]

08:12.992 --> 08:14.869
-Guys, this is Lisa.
-Hi.

08:14.952 --> 08:17.914
-Hey.
-She's a little Severino for the day.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.333
You play college ball or just high school?

08:20.416 --> 08:24.253
Elementary, mainly, I'm really bad.
I look athletic, but I am not--

08:24.337 --> 08:25.588
Sure, you're not.

08:25.671 --> 08:28.674
-She's gonna be fine, gonna be great.
-Okay, guys, let's warm up.

08:28.758 --> 08:31.302
-[blows whistle] Drill!
-Alright, drill, drill, drill!

08:31.385 --> 08:33.054
This looks intense. Maybe I should watch--

08:33.137 --> 08:34.639
No, no, no, it's cash, it's cash.

08:34.722 --> 08:37.016
Come on! Hustle the fuck on!

08:37.433 --> 08:38.893
-Go, go, go!
-Put that down, let's go.

08:38.976 --> 08:40.269
-Let's jump in.
-Okay.

08:41.395 --> 08:44.565
-So what do you do?
-I'm a trauma surgeon.

08:44.649 --> 08:47.527
Oh, wow! That's so cool!

08:47.610 --> 08:50.446
Bet you have, like, really crazy stories.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.657
I'm sorry. I gotta focus on the game.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.242
-Okay.
-Hey, hey, hey!

08:54.325 --> 08:55.493
-Here we are.
-Pick it up.

08:55.576 --> 08:58.120
Pick it up. Here, Liz, to me. Back to me.

09:00.206 --> 09:01.582
[woman cheers]

09:01.666 --> 09:03.167
Doctor in the house!

09:05.878 --> 09:07.880
[doctor] All right!

09:09.799 --> 09:12.093
-Sorry. She just--
-God damn it!

09:12.593 --> 09:14.929
-She knocked me down. I don't even--
-No, no.

09:15.012 --> 09:16.973
It's not your fault,
it's not your fault. Just...

09:17.056 --> 09:19.642
Why were you trying to have a conversation
with her in the middle--

09:19.725 --> 09:22.228
You know what, we're cool. It's good.
Here we go. Fuck!

09:24.355 --> 09:26.524
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.528
-[whistle blows]
-Ahh!

09:30.611 --> 09:31.862
Alright!

09:33.197 --> 09:35.783
Lawyer in the court.
This is the gavel, I am a lawyer.

09:35.866 --> 09:37.660
Handball, that's a P-kick.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.829
-Wait, what? What's a P-kick?
-Yeah.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.706
Penalty kick. It's alright, Lis,

09:41.789 --> 09:44.000
-it's not your fault, it's just a game.
-I know that.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.085
Cool, fuck. Shit. Here we go.

09:46.168 --> 09:48.504
But that was all body, I didn't touch it.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.339
Bro. It hit your arm.

09:50.423 --> 09:51.591
That's a handball.

09:51.674 --> 09:53.509
It's all connected, Lis.
It's kind of confusing.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.386
-It's fine.
-It didn't hit my arm.

09:55.469 --> 09:57.972
You sure? You sure it wasn't incidental?

09:58.055 --> 10:00.725
I just said, it wasn't a handball,
why don't you believe me?

10:00.808 --> 10:02.727
'Cause it kind of looked like a handball,

10:02.810 --> 10:05.730
-and we try to be our best selves here.
-Yeah.

10:05.813 --> 10:09.650
She knocked me down! No one was trying
to be their best self then!

10:09.734 --> 10:13.946
Babe, why don't you calm down?
Go get some water or something, cool off.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.531
-It's gonna be fine.
-Yeah.

10:15.948 --> 10:17.783
Yeah, I need to cool down.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.327
Get real cool.

10:23.914 --> 10:25.833
-Thanks.
-Yeah, you're welcome.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.443
Hey!

10:52.526 --> 10:54.445
Hey, hey!

10:54.528 --> 10:57.406
What are you doing here, honey?

10:57.490 --> 10:59.825
Oh, where are your parents, huh?

11:00.826 --> 11:02.495
Hello, is this--

11:03.079 --> 11:05.122
Is this anybody's baby, it's...

11:05.790 --> 11:07.208
a girl I think.

11:08.793 --> 11:10.461
I'll help you, I'm a lawyer.

11:17.218 --> 11:20.262
Hey, let's see what's here.

11:25.476 --> 11:29.146
Oh, my God, your baby is so beautiful.
She has your face.

11:31.023 --> 11:34.652
-She does?
-The eyes and nose. It's uncanny.

11:36.404 --> 11:38.739
Get something to eat?
Let's see if there's some food.

11:39.281 --> 11:40.533
Oh, look, look, look!

11:42.743 --> 11:45.538
Hey lady! What are you doing with our son?

11:45.955 --> 11:47.331
I--

11:47.498 --> 11:50.543
[stammering]
I just found him outside, just all alone.

11:50.626 --> 11:53.045
He must have wandered.
Why didn't you wait there?

11:53.129 --> 11:56.424
He was hungry.
What was he doing outside all by himself?

11:57.007 --> 11:59.969
-I don't know how this happened.
-You were on your phone!

12:01.971 --> 12:04.724
Thank you. Thank you
for taking such good care of him.

12:04.807 --> 12:07.435
It's all-- This is-- Here's--

24:57.579 --> 24:58.955
-Alright, cool.
-Cool.

24:59.748 --> 25:00.874
I'll just put it here.

25:05.754 --> 25:10.091
I'm sorry. The night got away for me,
but I'm here now so...

25:10.717 --> 25:12.594
-Your friends seem cool.
-Do you have any idea

25:12.677 --> 25:14.596
how humiliating that was for me?

25:14.679 --> 25:17.307
Here I am, telling everyone about you,

25:17.390 --> 25:20.310
and then you show up four hours late
with some rando.

25:20.393 --> 25:21.520
Well, that's Marianne.

25:22.646 --> 25:24.064
I know I--

25:24.147 --> 25:27.150
I said I'd swing by and I swung by.

25:29.653 --> 25:33.114
At this point in my life, I'm not really
looking for a "swing by" relationship.

25:40.622 --> 25:42.624
[all laughing]

25:45.961 --> 25:49.548
-Oh, man.
-Oh, man. That was awesome!

25:49.631 --> 25:52.384
-Can't hear anything.
-I feel like it's still ringing.

25:52.467 --> 25:53.468
Yeah.

25:53.552 --> 25:54.636
I think I'm gonna walk home.

25:54.719 --> 25:57.264
-It was lovely meeting you.
-Really nice meeting you. This was fun.

25:57.347 --> 25:58.265
Take care.

25:58.765 --> 26:00.642
-I'll talk to you next week. Bye.
-Okay.

26:00.725 --> 26:01.851
-Bye. See you later.
-Bye-bye.

26:05.146 --> 26:07.691
What happened?
I thought this was going great.

26:07.774 --> 26:08.817
Yeah, she's cool.

26:10.235 --> 26:11.778
-What's wrong?
-You don't wanna know.

26:11.861 --> 26:13.238
I don't want to know?

26:13.530 --> 26:15.407
It's the Sam bullshit?

26:17.117 --> 26:19.411
Ethan, you gotta move on.

26:19.494 --> 26:21.037
It's not senior year anymore.

26:21.121 --> 26:24.833
Expand your dating pool beyond
the Dunster House B entryway.

26:24.916 --> 26:26.626
Okay, I understand what you saying.

26:26.710 --> 26:28.545
I feel you can move forward

26:28.628 --> 26:33.091
and you just getting pulled back
into, like, the morass of Ethan and Sam.

26:33.174 --> 26:36.511
You're trying to get pulled out
and it just sucks you back in.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.597
It's like you're Vietnam.

26:38.680 --> 26:39.681
Viet-Sam.

26:39.764 --> 26:41.683
I understand your point,
I get the analogy.

26:41.766 --> 26:43.893
-Ho Chi Sam trail.
-Okay.

26:43.977 --> 26:46.313
-I get it.
-Don't walk down that trail.

26:46.396 --> 26:49.316
-I understand.
-It's not Charlie, it's Sam.

26:49.399 --> 26:52.444
I'm just not ready to date.
I told you that beforehand.

26:52.527 --> 26:54.904
-I should've listened. Yes.
-You should've listened.

26:54.988 --> 26:56.406
-Alright, well--

26:56.489 --> 26:59.117
Wait, I'm blowing up. I'm blowing up.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.828
-Oh, shit. Oh, shit!
-What?

27:02.454 --> 27:04.122
"I'm on my way home." Felix.

27:04.205 --> 27:05.415
-Felix?
-He's coming home early.

27:05.498 --> 27:06.833
-Get home.
-He doesn't like when--

27:06.916 --> 27:09.127
He likes charming drunk, like, fun.

27:09.210 --> 27:11.880
And not-- He says
I get belligerent and handsy.

27:11.963 --> 27:13.506
Okay, Ethan.

27:13.590 --> 27:16.343
-Let's get you home.
-Felix is handsy.

27:16.426 --> 27:18.303
-Okay, bye. Love you.
-Bye-bye.

Alright.

27:24.392 --> 27:26.102
-I'm so hungry.
-I bet you are.

27:26.186 --> 27:27.937
I should have had something to eat.

27:28.021 --> 27:29.939
-Yes.
-At the honeymoon!

27:30.023 --> 27:30.982
