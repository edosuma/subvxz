Olivia, Juliette, Lulu.

04:01.166 --> 04:03.291
Can we stop talking about the tour?
They're going, we know that.

But my internship with Jacques Le Fejette.

Oh, that's what I love to see.
My boys are cracking the books.

04:32.458 --> 04:36.667
All right. Now, don't forget,
if you don't pass these exams tomorrow,

04:36.750 --> 04:39.875
then you will have to stay here
and repeat the class.

04:39.959 --> 04:41.458
We know.
And that means no tour.

which means if he gets a certain score

13:33.125 --> 13:35.041
which is... what is it again?

13:35.125 --> 13:37.417
-A hundred.
-A hundred, he passes geometry.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.041

13:47.125 --> 13:49.000
There's no way I can get 100.

13:49.500 --> 13:51.041
Sure it is.
It's easy.

13:51.125 --> 13:52.250

13:52.875 --> 13:56.041
I took on way too many things:
the test, the tour preparations.

13:56.125 --> 13:57.834
Thought I could handle it, but...

13:57.917 --> 14:00.125
now I have no time to learn
what I need to know.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.083
I could tutor you.

14:02.166 --> 14:04.291
Kevin, you got a "D" in geometry.

14:04.375 --> 14:05.917
Yes, and he got an "F."

14:06.000 --> 14:08.166
So, if we combine
our two scores we get a...

14:08.250 --> 14:10.542
"E."
We get an "E."

14:11.333 --> 14:13.208

-What's that on your shirt?
-Oh! Right, you got me.

is the second-oldest trick in the book.

14:39.750 --> 14:41.959
