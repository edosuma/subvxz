Hey, guys! Uh, it's Kayla.
Back with another video.

00:16.640 --> 00:20.838
Okay, um, so first thing's first is, um...

00:20.920 --> 00:23.559
I haven't been getting, like,
a lot of views or whatever on my videos,

00:23.640 --> 00:26.393
so if you guys could share,
like with your friends and stuff,

00:26.480 --> 00:28.357
I would really, really appreciate it.

00:29.040 --> 00:34.398
Uh, okay, so the topic of today's video
is "being yourself,"

00:34.480 --> 00:38.473
and it's like, you know,
well, aren't I always being myself?

00:38.600 --> 00:40.591
And like, yeah. For sure.

00:40.960 --> 00:44.077
Um, but, uh...

00:44.960 --> 00:47.793
Sorry, I'm reading these off paper.

00:47.880 --> 00:49.108
Um, okay.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.634
But it's like, being yourself is, like,

00:51.720 --> 00:54.075
not changing yourself
to impress someone else.

00:54.680 --> 00:56.352
You know, 'cause, like, um...

00:57.360 --> 01:01.353
like, uh, you could be
the most popular kid at school or, like,

01:01.440 --> 01:04.955
you know, like, um, have like
the hottest boyfriend or whatever,

01:05.040 --> 01:08.589
urn, but, like, what's the point
if you're not being yourself?

01:09.040 --> 01:10.029
And it's like...

01:10.920 --> 01:12.114
being yourself can be hard.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.031
And, like, the hard part
about being yourself

01:14.120 --> 01:15.838
is that it's not always easy

01:15.920 --> 01:19.833
because, you know, like, people can,
like, um...

01:19.920 --> 01:22.753
like, make fun of you or something dumb.

01:22.840 --> 01:25.513
Because, like, people suck,
and evil people exist.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.233
Um, but you just got to ignore them
and not care what they're saying. Um...

01:32.080 --> 01:34.389
Uh, and...

01:36.120 --> 01:37.519
Like, for instance, like...

01:38.080 --> 01:40.992
you know, a lot of people, like,
call me quiet or shy or whatever,

01:41.120 --> 01:43.839
um, but I'm not quiet, like...

01:43.920 --> 01:47.196
You know, I don't talk
a lot at school but, um...

01:48.040 --> 01:51.237
I just... It's not like I'm scared
to not talk, I just don't want to.

01:51.320 --> 01:54.790
But if people actually, you know,
be my friend...

01:54.880 --> 01:56.313
Like, you know, talk to me and stuff,

01:56.400 --> 01:59.756
they'd find out that I'm really funny
and cool and talkative.

01:59.840 --> 02:04.960
And, yeah, I'm just... I'm not quiet.
I just choose not to talk a lot at school,

02:05.040 --> 02:06.359
like other people, you know?

02:07.000 --> 02:09.467
Um...
okay, so, yeah...

02:09.560 --> 02:14.554
uh, I hope that, basically,
you know, be yourself

02:14.640 --> 02:16.596
and don't care about whatever...

02:16.680 --> 02:18.398
what other people think about you.

02:18.480 --> 02:22.598
And just, like, you know, ignore them
if they're being mean to you about it.

02:22.680 --> 02:25.956
And everything will work out
if you're just being yourself.

02:26.840 --> 02:29.195
Uh, okay. Thank you, guys,
for watching this video.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.714
I hope some of you guys found it helpful.

02:31.800 --> 02:35.315
Um, and make sure to subscribe
to my channel. Bleh!

02:35.400 --> 02:37.436
Um, and, yeah. Thank you for watching.

Gucci.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.152
Hey, guys,
welcome back to my channel.

03:10.240 --> 03:13.949
Today I'm giving a tutorial
on my "going out" look.

03:14.040 --> 03:16.998
So, this is kind of
my standard look that I always do.

03:17.080 --> 03:19.514
So, if you want to see what I do,
then just keep watching.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.875
The first thing I like to do is
instead of moisturizer...

05:04.360 --> 05:10.151
Over the course of these next 30 minutes,
we will begin to explore

05:10.240 --> 05:13.869
and understand these
changing bodies of yours.

05:14.760 --> 05:16.034
It's gonna be lit.

05:16.920 --> 05:21.198
Chapter One. The Hair Down There.

05:22.400 --> 05:27.155
Pubic hair
or "pubes" are heavier,

05:27.240 --> 05:31.233
longer, more coarse hairs
that develop during puberty.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.436
Tristan, are you masturbating?

05:37.080 --> 05:38.479
I wasn't masturbating!

05:40.960 --> 05:43.952
Guys, stop being weird.
Stop being weird. Stop being weird.

05:53.760 --> 05:55.398
Hey. Settle down.

05:57.480 --> 06:01.359
Eight graders, next week is your last week
here at Miles Grove Middle School...

06:01.440 --> 06:02.873
-[boyj LeBron James.
- Yes. Yeah.

06:04.120 --> 06:07.032
But we also have a lot of important work
in front of us.

06:07.440 --> 06:09.192
And some fun work in front of us.

06:09.520 --> 06:13.718
And we also have your
sixth-grade time capsules.

06:14.320 --> 06:18.074
Remember when you made those shoeboxes
the first week of sixth grade?

06:18.680 --> 06:23.549
Remember how we said it would
be a gift to your future you

06:23.640 --> 06:27.030
when you finally made it here
at Miles Grove Middle School?

06:27.680 --> 06:30.035
Well, you have made it.

06:30.160 --> 06:35.154
So, pick those up in the lobby
after this assembly's over.

06:36.400 --> 06:39.278
Now I'm going to hand things
over to Mrs. Rosh,

06:39.360 --> 06:43.148
who will read out the results
of the eighth-grade superlatives.

06:43.240 --> 06:44.309
Mrs. Rosh?

06:50.040 --> 06:52.759
- [boyj Are you my mom?

06:52.840 --> 06:55.195

Okay. Congratulations superlative winners.

07:52.520 --> 07:54.988
So, after you get your photos taken,

07:55.120 --> 07:58.112
I want you to report
to fifth-period class.

07:58.800 --> 08:03.555
Now, let's see, we'll start with
Mr. and Mrs. Best Eyes,

08:03.640 --> 08:06.359
Aiden Wilson-Carter and Kennedy Graves.

08:12.000 --> 08:12.955
Good job.

08:16.880 --> 08:18.996
Aiden. Aidenl

08:36.559 --> 08:37.788
Good job.

11:05.760 --> 11:06.749
Hi.

11:10.520 --> 11:13.239
Hey, yellow shirt!

11:15.480 --> 11:16.435
Hi!

11:18.680 --> 11:19.590
Come here.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.631
Hi. Yes, come here.

11:24.120 --> 11:27.351
- Hi. You're Mark's girl, right?
- Yeah.

11:27.440 --> 11:30.955
Oh, your dad was such a huge help
with the spring fundraiser.

11:31.040 --> 11:32.598
Thank him again for me, will you?

11:33.000 --> 11:34.399
- I will.
- What's your name again?

11:34.800 --> 11:36.028
- Kayla.
- Right, Kayla.

11:36.120 --> 11:38.509
Hey, so we just opened our pool...

11:38.600 --> 11:39.669
- Shush!

11:39.800 --> 11:40.710
We just opened our pool,

11:40.800 --> 11:43.837
and we are going to have our first big
summer pool party tomorrow

11:43.920 --> 11:47.276
to celebrate Kennedy's birthday.
It's gonna be so much fun, right, Kennedy?

11:47.760 --> 11:49.591
- Yep.
- You should come. It's gonna be a blast.

11:49.680 --> 11:51.398
Kennedy will invite you on Facebook.

11:51.520 --> 11:53.670
- Right, Kennedy?
- No one uses Facebook anymore.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.671
Anyway, do you think you can come, or...

11:56.080 --> 11:58.548
Oh, I mean... Maybe.

11:58.640 --> 12:00.471
I'll try, but, you know, probably not.

12:00.560 --> 12:02.198
Oh, no, no. You should come.
It's gonna be a blast.

12:02.280 --> 12:04.589
But don't forget to thank
your dad for me, okay?

12:04.920 --> 12:06.399
- Yeah. Yeah.
- So, you're gonna...

12:06.480 --> 12:07.708
We'll see you tomorrow maybe, or...

12:07.800 --> 12:10.553
Yeah. Yeah, I'll try, you know...

12:10.640 --> 12:12.710
I mean, I'd like to.
I just don't know if I can.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.916
No, no, you'll be there.
Okay, see you tomorrow.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.911
- Say goodbye, Kennedy.
- Bye.

12:17.000 --> 12:17.955
Bye.

12:44.040 --> 12:44.950
Kayla.

12:48.600 --> 12:50.670
- Kayla!
- What?

12:53.720 --> 12:55.836
- Food's getting cold.
- I like it cold.

13:05.120 --> 13:08.112
- One more week of eighth grade, huh?
- Huh?

13:10.280 --> 13:12.748
I said one more week
of eighth grade, right?

13:12.840 --> 13:13.909
Yeah.

13:14.320 --> 13:17.073
- That's crazy.
- Yeah. Huh.

13:17.160 --> 13:18.957
I can't believe you're gonna
be in high school.

13:19.040 --> 13:20.075
Mmm-hmm.

13:20.160 --> 13:21.195
How did that happen?

13:22.080 --> 13:23.069
I don't know.

13:26.440 --> 13:27.475
You excited?

13:28.200 --> 13:29.110
Yes.

13:30.920 --> 13:33.388
Yes. Yes, I'm very excited.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.315
I'm so excited.

13:39.800 --> 13:43.873
- Hey, I got an email from Mrs. Graves.
- Huh?

13:43.960 --> 13:46.918
I got an email from Mrs. Graves

13:47.000 --> 13:49.958
that said you're going to go
to Kennedy's birthday thing tomorrow?

13:50.040 --> 13:51.029
No.

13:51.120 --> 13:52.553
- Really?
- Yeah, no.

13:52.960 --> 13:55.349
- It sounded kinda fun.
- Kennedy doesn't like me.

13:56.160 --> 13:57.912
- That can't be true.
- Cool.

13:58.520 --> 14:00.351
Sometimes kids act
like they don't like you,

14:00.440 --> 14:03.591
but it's really just 'cause they got their
own stuff going on, and they don't...

14:06.360 --> 14:07.270
Kayla.

14:09.840 --> 14:10.795
Kayla.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.478
Are you kidding me right now?

14:17.560 --> 14:19.755
- I'm just being funny.
- Dad, no! It's not funny!

14:19.840 --> 14:21.751
You're the only one
that thinks it's funny!

14:23.400 --> 14:24.879
You don't think I'm funny?

14:24.960 --> 14:27.155
Dad! Dad, it's a Friday.

14:27.240 --> 14:29.151
You said I could do
whatever I want on Fridays.

14:29.240 --> 14:31.629
- And right now...
- Okay, you're right. Okay, I did.

14:31.720 --> 14:33.278
All right. Can I say one thing, though?

14:33.360 --> 14:35.316
Then you can go back to your phone,
I'll leave you alone.

14:35.840 --> 14:37.876
- I just want to say one thing.
- Fine!

14:38.280 --> 14:39.952
Okay, but you have to let me
finish saying it.

14:40.040 --> 14:41.393
Yeah, I will. I'm not even...

14:41.480 --> 14:43.994
You can't get angry before I finish
saying it, otherwise you won't listen.

14:44.080 --> 14:46.389
- Fine. Just say it.
- All right. All right. Okay.

14:47.840 --> 14:48.750
Okay.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.797
- Are you gonna say it?
- I'm thinking.

14:56.560 --> 14:59.632
I think you're so cool.
I think you are so cool.

14:59.720 --> 15:01.278
I'm gonna stop eating with you if you...

15:01.360 --> 15:02.793
Hey, I'm saying...
You said I could say one thing.

15:02.920 --> 15:04.558
Can I say one thing, please?

15:05.960 --> 15:07.109
- Fine.
- Thank you.

15:08.760 --> 15:10.830
Look, when I as your age,
I was not cool like you.

15:10.920 --> 15:14.230
You have all these interests
and your videos

15:14.320 --> 15:18.518
and, just, how you express
yourself in them, is so...

15:19.040 --> 15:20.473
It's just so cool. It's so great.

15:20.560 --> 15:22.471
I just... I just think...

15:23.760 --> 15:26.479
maybe you just need to put yourself
out there a little bit more.

15:26.560 --> 15:29.028
- Please stop. Dad, please.
- I know the kids at school are not great.

15:29.120 --> 15:31.429
I'm not saying you have to be
best friends with Kennedy Graves.

15:31.520 --> 15:32.555
And I know this is gonna sound lame,

15:32.640 --> 15:34.437
I just think you're
a really special person.

15:34.520 --> 15:35.839
- Dad...
- And I know it's like,

15:35.920 --> 15:37.592
you know, all dads think that.

15:37.680 --> 15:40.240
But even if I wasn't your dad,
I would still think that.

15:40.320 --> 15:41.435
- I would. I'm sorry.
- Dad!

15:41.520 --> 15:43.033
- I'm sorry. I would.
- Dad! Dad! Dad!

15:43.120 --> 15:44.599
This is more than one thing.

15:44.680 --> 15:46.272
- It's a chunk of things.

15:46.360 --> 15:50.831
And I know it's like, "Dad, shut up.
Duh! Shut up." I get it. Please, I get it.

15:50.920 --> 15:53.036
But I'm actually not saying this
to make you feel bad.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.394
I'm saying it to make you feel better.

15:54.480 --> 15:55.515
You know what'd make me feel better?

15:55.640 --> 15:57.790
- What?
-ls if you'd let me go on my phone.

15:58.880 --> 15:59.869
Okay, fine.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.473
- Go ahead. Do your thing.
- Thanks.

18:43.880 --> 18:45.393
Uh...

18:50.960 --> 18:52.029
I'm just going to bed.

18:52.400 --> 18:53.276
Okay.

18:54.160 --> 18:55.070
Okay.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.672
- Good night.
- Good night.

19:00.800 --> 19:01.710
Are you...

19:02.200 --> 19:03.792
- Are you mad at me?
- No, I just...

19:04.240 --> 19:05.832
Next time, can you please knock?

19:05.920 --> 19:07.399
Yeah, sure. Sorry. I did.

19:07.720 --> 19:08.709
Well...

19:09.480 --> 19:11.391
do it louder or something. I don't know.

19:11.800 --> 19:13.791
For sure. Yeah. Got it.

19:13.920 --> 19:16.229
Sorry. Good night. Okay.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.233
Good night.

19:31.160 --> 19:32.115
Please...

19:33.240 --> 19:35.071
Shit. Shit!

19:56.760 --> 19:59.228
Hey, guys. Kayla back here
with another video.

19:59.760 --> 20:05.039
Uh, okay, so the topic of today's video is
"Putting Yourself Out There."

20:05.800 --> 20:08.837
Um, okay. So, like, what does that mean?

20:08.920 --> 20:10.558
Where is "there"?

20:11.000 --> 20:15.516
Well, "there" can be anywhere
that you wouldn't usually go.

20:15.600 --> 20:19.513
You know, maybe because it's,
like, weird or scary or, um...

20:20.320 --> 20:21.514
something like that.

20:21.920 --> 20:27.040
Um, okay, and now you're probably
thinking, you know, well,

20:27.160 --> 20:29.628
"Why would I want to go
somewhere like that?"

20:30.480 --> 20:34.314
And there's actually lots of reasons.

20:34.400 --> 20:39.190
Uh, one reason is that
people might not know the real you.

20:39.520 --> 20:41.476
Like, if you only ever see,

20:41.560 --> 20:44.438
you know, some people
at school or something,

20:44.520 --> 20:47.318
then those people are only
going to know the school you.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.595
But if you put yourself out there

20:49.680 --> 20:52.831
and you go to places
you wouldn't usually go,

20:52.920 --> 20:56.276
people can know the movie you
or the pool you

20:56.400 --> 20:59.676
or the party you or the weekend you.

20:59.760 --> 21:02.832
All the yous that make up the real you.

21:03.480 --> 21:04.833
Like, for example,

21:04.920 --> 21:07.388
this one time I was having
a bunch of friends over,

21:07.480 --> 21:11.951
and my dad made me invite this
one weird girl, or whatever,

21:12.080 --> 21:14.719
and, you know,
I didn't really want to invite her

21:14.800 --> 21:18.998
because at school she was just
always weird, so I didn't like her.

21:19.080 --> 21:22.197
But my dad made me invite her,
so then she came over,

21:22.280 --> 21:24.396
and I got to know the real her.

21:24.760 --> 21:27.433
And she actually was
really cool and funny.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.078
- Kayla!
- And, like, just awesome.

21:29.160 --> 21:32.038
And all my friends were just, like,
"Who is she ?"

21:32.120 --> 21:34.588
And everyone was just, like,
talking about her the whole time.

21:36.520 --> 21:37.873
So, yeah. And...

21:38.560 --> 21:41.552
I guess that's basically
what I was trying to say,

21:41.640 --> 21:45.030
like, you know, you just need
to put yourself out there

21:45.120 --> 21:49.591
and face your fears and, you know,
let people know the real you.

21:49.960 --> 21:53.509
And it doesn't matter if you're scared
because everyone's gonna be scared.

21:53.960 --> 21:56.679
Uh, okay, hope... Bleh.

21:56.760 --> 22:00.548

22:05.000 --> 22:06.069
Gucci.

25:11.040 --> 25:14.237
Tyler, stop. Stop. Tyler!

25:14.320 --> 25:16.709
- No. No.
- Stop. Stop.

25:19.920 --> 25:20.830
Aiden!

25:49.080 --> 25:51.674
All the way. Did it all the way.

25:51.760 --> 25:52.909
What?

25:53.560 --> 25:55.676
I swam all the way across
the pool underwater.

25:57.120 --> 26:00.237
You know, I could have went further
if I wanted to, but whatever.

26:00.320 --> 26:02.470
- Wanna see me do a handstand?
- Uh...

26:09.280 --> 26:10.429
Too many people in the pool.

26:10.520 --> 26:12.397
Can't do it for long
if the water isn't still.

26:12.480 --> 26:13.799
I'm Gabe. What's your name?

26:14.240 --> 26:15.912
Uh, I'm Kayla.

26:16.280 --> 26:18.396
Okay. Yeah, cool. I'm going to try again.

26:25.160 --> 26:26.991
Yeah. Water's not calm enough.

26:27.080 --> 26:29.389
- Yeah.
- So, how do you know Kennedy?

26:29.760 --> 26:31.432
Oh, we go to school together.

26:31.520 --> 26:32.635
Oh, okay. Yeah.

26:33.200 --> 26:34.633
That's cool. She's my cousin.

26:34.720 --> 26:36.358
Want to do a breath-holding contest?

26:37.160 --> 26:38.673
- Yeah. Sure.
- Okay, cool.

26:38.760 --> 26:40.637
One, two, three...

26:56.680 --> 26:58.318
I won.

26:58.640 --> 27:01.359
Okay, so the trick is, don't move at all

27:01.440 --> 27:03.351
because when you move
your body uses oxygen.

27:03.440 --> 27:05.317
Okay. Picture time!

27:05.400 --> 27:06.753
Oh, shush, Kennedy.

27:06.840 --> 27:11.038
Girls first. Come on, girls. Gather round.
Over there by the diving board.

27:11.920 --> 27:13.638
She said all the girls over there.

27:13.720 --> 27:15.870
- Oh, yeah. Right.
- Yeah.

27:15.960 --> 27:16.995
No boys allowed.

27:18.160 --> 27:20.720
All right. Yes, okay.

27:20.800 --> 27:25.237
Let's all get in together. Great. Okay.

27:25.320 --> 27:27.788
Wait. Kayla, I can't see you, sweetie.
Come up front.

27:29.040 --> 27:32.555
There you go. Okay. And cheese!

27:32.920 --> 27:34.717
Cheese!

27:34.840 --> 27:36.068
Yay!

27:36.160 --> 27:38.037
This is for you.

27:38.360 --> 27:39.509
Oh, my God.

27:39.960 --> 27:41.996
I'm so excited!

27:42.880 --> 27:44.438
It's, like, so you.

27:46.200 --> 27:48.839
Oh, my God. Dude! Oh, my God.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.791
It'll look so good on you.

27:54.640 --> 27:57.074
I know. I love it.

27:57.160 --> 27:59.833
And this one's from Kayla.

28:00.360 --> 28:01.588
She's right over there.

28:21.080 --> 28:22.433
What is it?

28:22.520 --> 28:24.715
Uh, it's a card game, um...

28:24.800 --> 28:26.074
It's actually really fun.

28:26.160 --> 28:30.915
Like, everyone gets ten cards
and you take turns, like, um...

28:31.000 --> 28:33.195
It's like Go Fish, except a lot more fun.

28:33.800 --> 28:36.268
Okay. This one's from Julia.

28:36.400 --> 28:38.755
- Happy birthday to you.
- No, Mike!

28:38.840 --> 28:40.910
- Oh, my God. No, no!
- Mike! Come on, Mike...

28:41.000 --> 28:43.434
- What? What?
- It's not time yet.

28:43.520 --> 28:45.158
It's time. I brought it
down from the kitchen.

28:45.240 --> 28:46.309
I got it all over my shirt.

28:46.400 --> 28:47.913
- It's time to eat! What?
- Mike.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.274
- Oh, my God!
- I picked this thing up

28:49.360 --> 28:51.430
at 8:00 in the goddamn morning! Eat it!

28:52.240 --> 28:53.468
Oh, my God.

28:54.560 --> 28:57.120
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

28:57.920 --> 28:59.990
Dad, can you pleasejust come get me?

29:01.400 --> 29:03.755
No, yeah, the party's over.

29:04.720 --> 29:06.392
I don't know how it ended, Dad, okay?

29:06.760 --> 29:09.752
It's just kind of, like, over. My God.

29:10.480 --> 29:12.152
Dad, I'm the last one here, okay?

29:12.800 --> 29:14.279
Can you please just come get me?

29:14.680 --> 29:16.875
- Are you whispering?
- No, I'm not whispering.

29:16.960 --> 29:18.473
It's just really bad reception here.

29:18.560 --> 29:20.516
Okay, listen, I can get there...

29:20.600 --> 29:22.431
Just come get me, please.

29:22.520 --> 29:25.114
- All right. In an hour.
- Can you please come quicker?

29:25.240 --> 29:26.992
I'll try, I'm not done...

29:27.080 --> 29:28.593
Fine. It's whatever. Fine.

29:28.680 --> 29:30.989
Just text me when you're here
and don't come inside.

29:31.440 --> 29:33.510
Okay. Are you okay?
Is everything all right?

29:34.040 --> 29:35.314
All right. Yeah.

29:35.400 --> 29:36.594
- You sure?
- Thanks.

29:36.680 --> 29:38.477
- What?
- Thanks, I said.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.070
- Okay, Have you. Bye.
- All right. Bye.

29:41.160 --> 29:42.957
- Love you too.
- Kayla, is everything...

29:56.040 --> 29:57.155
Oh, sorry.

29:59.640 --> 30:00.868
No.

30:01.680 --> 30:02.908
I just gotta...

30:04.120 --> 30:05.155
What?

30:08.160 --> 30:10.628
Was just grabbing my phone.
Had to charge it.

30:12.200 --> 30:15.795
Yeah. Sometimes I charge it, too.
My phone. I...

30:16.720 --> 30:19.792
Yeah, sometimes my phone
runs out of batteries, too.

30:21.080 --> 30:22.559
You know, everyone's in there.

30:23.440 --> 30:26.512
Oh, that's where everyone is. Okay. Uh...

30:26.920 --> 30:28.433
I'll go out there in a second.

30:30.680 --> 30:31.635
Okay.

30:42.720 --> 30:45.314
Hey, guys. It's Kayla,
back here with another video.

30:45.760 --> 30:49.309
Okay, so the topic of today's video,
which is super cool,

30:49.400 --> 30:51.914
is, "How To Be Confident."

30:59.000 --> 31:03.516
So I think one thing a lot of people
think about confidence

31:03.600 --> 31:05.716
is that, like, you know,
you're born with it.

31:05.840 --> 31:08.274
You either are confident or you're not.

31:08.360 --> 31:10.237
You know, just like how
some people are tall.

31:10.320 --> 31:15.348
You're either tall or short.
But it's not like that, actually.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.272
Confidence is a choice.

31:20.840 --> 31:24.719
Like, the really awesome thing
about confidence is that

31:25.320 --> 31:28.949
you can just start acting like it,
even if you feel like you don't have any.

31:30.240 --> 31:34.233
For example, I used to, like,
not be confident at all.

31:34.320 --> 31:37.869
But then one day, I'm like,
"I want to be confident. "

31:38.360 --> 31:38.758
So, then I just kind of
started acting like it,

31:38.760 --> 31:38.839
So, then I just kind of
started acting like it,

31:38.840 --> 31:40.592
So, then I just kind of
started acting like it,

31:40.680 --> 31:42.193
and then it made me feel good,

31:42.280 --> 31:44.669
and then I actually
started being confident.

31:44.760 --> 31:46.113
Like, without trying.

31:47.680 --> 31:51.753
And, like, a big part of being confident
is being brave,

31:51.840 --> 31:54.274
and you can't be brave
unless you're scared.

31:55.360 --> 31:58.591
So, for those of you who are
feeling scared about being confident,

31:58.680 --> 32:02.229
that's actually a big part
of confidence, to be scared.

32:02.320 --> 32:03.514
That's normal.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.798
Because you can't be brave
without being scared.

32:08.360 --> 32:11.716
So, go out there
and just, like, be confident.

32:11.800 --> 32:15.509
And if you don't feel confident,
just do it anyways.

32:15.840 --> 32:17.637
Make yourself confident.

32:25.280 --> 32:29.990

Gucci.

32:40.520 --> 32:41.999
Oh, hey.

32:43.960 --> 32:46.269
Oh, hey. What's your name again?

32:48.160 --> 32:50.116
Oh, yeah. Oh, hey, totally.

32:51.120 --> 32:53.554
Yeah. Yeah, I'd be totally up for that.

32:54.480 --> 32:57.790
Yeah, that would...
That would be, like, great.

33:00.280 --> 33:01.235
Yeah.

33:03.680 --> 33:06.638
So... yeah.

33:09.400 --> 33:10.674
Someone said that?

33:11.800 --> 33:13.233
That's so dumb.

33:13.960 --> 33:16.918
So, like, dumb. I just...

33:18.960 --> 33:21.190
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I'd be totally up for that.

33:21.280 --> 33:23.840
That'd be so fun. Yeah, oh...

33:24.800 --> 33:26.711
Yeah, it was... It was great.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.033
Yeah, it was so fun.

33:31.680 --> 33:35.195
Oh, so that happened. Okay.

33:35.280 --> 33:37.032
So that's why you couldn't make it.

33:37.640 --> 33:38.914
No, Imean, that's fine.

33:40.720 --> 33:42.915
Yeah, of course. I'd love to come.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.309
Yeah, it'd be great if
we could just, like, do that...

33:47.800 --> 33:49.472
...by the stairs or something.

34:01.480 --> 34:02.993
- Really?
- Yes.

34:09.239 --> 34:11.754
Uh, Kennedy. Hey.

34:13.320 --> 34:16.437
Um, so, thanks for inviting me
to your party.

34:18.239 --> 34:19.831
Uh, no problem.

34:20.880 --> 34:23.757
By the way, I like your shirt a lot.
It's so cool.

34:23.840 --> 34:25.795
I have a shirt, too...

34:28.199 --> 34:29.315
Mmm-hmm.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.311
Also, you know, I, like...

34:31.400 --> 34:33.594
I wrote this, like,
letter for you and whatever,

34:33.679 --> 34:36.911
so if you want to have it,
it's a thank you.

34:41.880 --> 34:44.030
Oh, hey, Steph.

34:45.000 --> 34:45.909
What?

34:46.440 --> 34:47.350
Hey.

34:48.440 --> 34:49.918
Hi.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.639
Hey, well, thanks for talking to me,
you guys.

34:52.719 --> 34:55.359
Um, catch you later.

34:56.639 --> 34:57.629
Cool.

35:12.600 --> 35:14.477
- Oh, my God!
- Bang! Dead!

35:15.840 --> 35:17.034
Bang! Dead!

35:18.000 --> 35:19.194
Bang! Dead!

35:22.560 --> 35:24.312
Okay.

35:25.120 --> 35:28.669
Hey, how about let's give it up
for the volunteers from the drama club.

35:28.760 --> 35:30.990
- What do you say?

35:32.640 --> 35:34.517
Okay, kids.
We've gone over what you should do

35:34.600 --> 35:36.636
if you hear gunshots in the distance.

35:37.160 --> 35:39.549
And what are we supposed
to do in that situation?

35:39.960 --> 35:42.520
Run in the opposite direction.

35:42.600 --> 35:43.919
You sure about that?

35:44.920 --> 35:45.796
Yeah.

35:45.880 --> 35:47.950
- Hello?
- Yes. We're positive!

35:48.080 --> 35:49.354
Okay.

35:50.160 --> 35:53.470
But now we're gonna talk about what you
should do when the gunshots are close.

35:53.560 --> 35:55.391
Listen up, mister.

35:55.480 --> 35:59.553
Uh, you know, when the shooter's down the
hallway or right outside the classroom.

36:00.120 --> 36:04.910
What you just saw was an example
of what not to do. Okay?

36:05.240 --> 36:10.234
If the gunshots are loud and close,
and you're in a classroom or a bathroom,

36:10.760 --> 36:12.318
you should do the following...

36:12.440 --> 36:14.635
stay put, turn off the lights...

36:14.720 --> 36:16.073
Are you staring at Aiden?

36:16.840 --> 36:17.795
Huh?

36:17.880 --> 36:19.677
I said, are you staring at Aiden?

36:20.040 --> 36:21.792
- No.
- He's a dick.

36:21.880 --> 36:24.792
He dumped Chelsea because
she wouldn't send him naked pictures.

36:26.240 --> 36:28.276
Oh. That's weird.

36:28.960 --> 36:30.439
...with the dead or wounded.

36:30.520 --> 36:32.875
Coach Red to the main office.

36:33.240 --> 36:34.468
Coach Red to the main office, please.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.073
Okay, everyone.
That's the signal.

36:36.440 --> 36:38.908
Please be respectful
of the drill and stay quiet.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.558
Should only be a few minutes.

37:16.160 --> 37:17.593
14%;;-
3kg

37:18.760 --> 37:20.910
Uh, whatcha doing?

37:21.000 --> 37:22.035
Playing a game.

37:22.800 --> 37:24.791
Cool. Cool. Um...

37:27.520 --> 37:29.272
Are you excited for high school?

37:30.200 --> 37:32.350
- Yeah. Should be cool.
- Yeah.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.831
You ever think there'd be
a real shooting here?

37:39.920 --> 37:41.069
- I wish.

37:41.800 --> 37:44.519
Same. Um, like...

37:45.080 --> 37:47.833
why do you wish there was one?

37:48.240 --> 37:49.559
'Cause I'd fuck him up.

37:49.920 --> 37:52.912
Take his gun and elbow him
right in the jaw, lay him out.

37:53.440 --> 37:55.556
I wouldn't be a pussy
and sit under my desk.

37:55.640 --> 37:57.835
Yeah, you would fuck him up.

37:58.200 --> 37:59.758
He'd be, like, totally screwed.

37:59.880 --> 38:00.915
- Yeah.

38:12.600 --> 38:14.591
Oh, my God, that was so embarrassing.

38:16.080 --> 38:19.072
Like, it's super funny. You won't, like...

38:19.720 --> 38:21.711
It was so funny, Aiden, I just...

38:23.560 --> 38:26.677
Like, yeah, it was really
funny what just happened.

38:28.560 --> 38:29.470
What?

38:29.800 --> 38:33.713
It's kind of just too embarrassing
for me to even, like, talk about.

38:33.800 --> 38:35.756
- I mean...
- Okay.

38:36.800 --> 38:39.109
I mean, I just...
l was trying to open up Instagram,

38:39.200 --> 38:42.397
and then I ended up pulling up
my dirty photos folder,

38:42.480 --> 38:44.118
-and it was just...
- Really?

38:46.600 --> 38:47.589
Yeah.

38:47.720 --> 38:48.709
What was it of?

38:49.720 --> 38:52.837
Just... you know, like...

38:53.320 --> 38:54.992
- Me.
- Doing what?

38:56.520 --> 39:00.274
I don't know.
Just, you know, like, hanging out.

39:00.400 --> 39:02.391
- Can I see it?
- No, no.

39:02.480 --> 39:04.152
It's only for my boyfriend to see.

39:04.240 --> 39:05.275
Who's your boyfriend?

39:05.360 --> 39:06.793
Uh, he's...

39:07.120 --> 39:10.590
you know, like, right now he's off...

39:11.800 --> 39:15.759
Well, I mean, I don't really have one
right now but, you know, like,

39:15.840 --> 39:18.991
I'm saving some dirty photos
to, like, send him

39:19.080 --> 39:20.399
when I do have one.

39:21.440 --> 39:23.635
- Really?
- Yeah.

39:27.680 --> 39:28.908
You do blowjobs?

39:30.600 --> 39:31.510
Uh...

39:35.080 --> 39:36.069
Kayla.

39:39.000 --> 39:44.711
To answer your question, I do,
and I'm, like, really good at them.

40:15.120 --> 40:20.114
Hi, I'm Dr. Kat, and I'm here to give you
some tips for performing oral sex on him.

40:20.200 --> 40:21.155
First off, you...

41:33.920 --> 41:35.876
Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

41:35.960 --> 41:36.915
You didn't.

41:38.160 --> 41:39.229
What are you up to?

41:39.720 --> 41:40.755
Nothing.

41:41.640 --> 41:42.629
Cool.

41:44.680 --> 41:45.795
School was good?

41:46.600 --> 41:47.589
Yeah.

41:48.080 --> 41:49.035
Good.

41:49.520 --> 41:52.398
Hey, you know who I ran into today?
Do you remember that guy who...

41:54.320 --> 41:56.038
- Is that a banana?
- What?

41:56.560 --> 41:57.515
What?

41:57.600 --> 41:58.874
You're having a banana?

41:59.760 --> 42:03.355
Oh, this, I was just grabbing a banana.

42:03.440 --> 42:04.793
I thought you hated bananas.

42:06.000 --> 42:06.989
No.

42:07.440 --> 42:09.112
I swear, like, a month ago

42:09.200 --> 42:13.432
I asked you if you wanted a banana,
and you got all angry at me, and you said

42:13.960 --> 42:17.111
you hate bananas, and I always
forget that you hate bananas.

42:18.920 --> 42:22.196
I actually think I wrote a note down
about it on my app thing,

42:22.280 --> 42:24.953
so I wouldn't... forget.

42:25.040 --> 42:27.759
Uh, I don't hate them anymore.

42:28.640 --> 42:29.993
Hmm. That's great.

42:31.480 --> 42:33.630
Yeah. I'll just eat it right now.

42:35.200 --> 42:36.474
Who cares?

42:53.200 --> 42:55.077
Are you sure you like them?

42:56.360 --> 42:57.554
Mmm-hmm.

42:59.800 --> 43:01.711
Honey, you don't look...

43:02.800 --> 43:04.472
Fine! I don't like bananas. Okay?

43:15.560 --> 43:16.470
Yeah?

43:20.240 --> 43:21.150
Hey.

43:21.480 --> 43:22.390
Hi.

43:23.600 --> 43:25.511
- How ya doin'?
- Good.

43:26.960 --> 43:27.870
Good.

43:30.480 --> 43:32.198
So, oh, you got the...

43:32.920 --> 43:35.115
high school thing tomorrow, right?
The shadow thing?

43:35.960 --> 43:38.076
- Yeah.
- That's cool. That should be fun.

43:38.800 --> 43:39.710
Yeah.

43:40.800 --> 43:42.916
Nice.

43:48.560 --> 43:49.515
Yeah.

43:50.480 --> 43:51.435
Yeah.

43:51.880 --> 43:53.791
All right,
I can't wait to hear about it.

43:55.000 --> 43:55.910
Yeah.

43:57.080 --> 43:58.513
All right. Well, I'm going to bed.

43:59.480 --> 44:00.390
I love you.

44:00.960 --> 44:02.313
Don't stay up too late.

44:03.960 --> 44:04.870
Hey.

44:07.280 --> 44:10.192
Just so you know,
you don't, well...

44:11.600 --> 44:12.999
I'm not mad, but...

44:13.760 --> 44:16.479
Just so you know, you don't need
to worry about me anymore

44:16.560 --> 44:18.949
because I'm actually doing
really great right now,

44:19.040 --> 44:21.235
and my life is really amazing.

44:24.760 --> 44:25.715
Cool.

44:27.320 --> 44:29.276
- That's awesome.
- Yeah.

44:31.480 --> 44:33.357
Okay. Good night.

44:33.480 --> 44:34.708
Okay. Good night.

44:35.280 --> 44:37.077
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

44:56.280 --> 44:59.238
Dear God, tomorrow is...

44:59.680 --> 45:03.355
Tomorrow is a really,
really important day for me,

45:04.360 --> 45:06.396
and I really need it...

45:06.920 --> 45:09.070
I really need you to make it a good day.

45:09.480 --> 45:10.549
I mean...

45:11.720 --> 45:14.632
I understand that every day can't be,

45:14.720 --> 45:16.517
like, a great day, urn...

45:17.640 --> 45:19.835
But I really need tomorrow
to be a good one.

45:20.440 --> 45:22.715
I mean, even if you give me
a ton of, like,

45:22.800 --> 45:25.473
really bad days in the future
or something, um...

45:26.240 --> 45:28.674
just as long as tomorrow
can be a really good day.

45:31.760 --> 45:33.990
All right. That's all.

45:35.720 --> 45:36.709
Thank you.

45:37.880 --> 45:39.632
Love, Kayla.

45:48.440 --> 45:50.317
Okay.
Settle down! Settle down!

45:50.400 --> 45:53.278
You are here for
the High School Shadow Program.

45:53.360 --> 45:54.998
We're gonna walk in there as a group,

45:55.080 --> 45:58.072
and you're gonna be individually paired
with a high school student.

45:58.640 --> 46:01.234
Now, you are to stay with that student
for the entire school day.

46:01.240 --> 46:01.353
Now, you are to stay with that student
for the entire school day.

46:01.360 --> 46:02.793
Now, you are to stay with that student
for the entire school day.

46:02.880 --> 46:06.190
You are not, repeat,
not to leave their side.

46:06.280 --> 46:10.114
So please be respectful
and take it all in.

46:10.600 --> 46:15.071
This is your chance to get a glimpse of
what life will be like for you next year.

46:15.720 --> 46:19.110
So, pay attention and have fun.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.194
Kayla?

46:52.280 --> 46:54.236
- Hi!
- Hey, hey. I'm Olivia.

46:54.320 --> 46:56.038
- Hi, I'm Kayla.
- I'm gonna hug you.

46:56.120 --> 46:57.599
- Okay.
- Okay, cool.

46:57.680 --> 46:58.829
Yeah, this is gonna be so fun.

46:58.960 --> 47:00.393
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah!

47:00.480 --> 47:02.038
You nervous?
Like, you don't have to be nervous.

47:02.120 --> 47:03.439
- Sorry.
- No, no, no. Don't be sorry.

47:03.520 --> 47:06.080
I'm... I'm nervous.
Like, I want you to have fun.

47:06.160 --> 47:07.832
Um, yeah. Okay, cool.
This is gonna be great.

47:07.920 --> 47:11.913
High school is boring and, like, horrible,
but, like, also amazing.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.513
- And it's gonna be great.
- Okay.

47:13.640 --> 47:15.756
People are awesome. You're gonna be...
Okay, this is gonna be so fun.

47:15.840 --> 47:18.354
Okay. You're so cute.
Okay, let's go, let's do this, okay?

47:19.440 --> 47:20.919
Yo, Liv. Martin got it.

47:21.280 --> 47:22.713
- Shut up.
- I'm serious.

47:22.800 --> 47:24.438
- Oh, my God.
- What was that?

47:24.520 --> 47:26.431
That's just a stupid inside joke.

47:26.520 --> 47:28.238
Um, Babs.

47:28.760 --> 47:31.957
Babs.
Did you do that thing for Kiley's class?

47:32.360 --> 47:33.793
- Fuck no.
- Thank God.

47:35.080 --> 47:36.069
Um, anyway...

47:36.680 --> 47:39.274
Yeah. So do you have any questions for me?

47:39.360 --> 47:41.157
No. No, I mean...

47:41.240 --> 47:43.800
- Well, does...
- You don't have to have a question.

47:43.920 --> 47:45.717
- Okay.
- Oh, my God, you're so cute.

47:45.840 --> 47:47.068
I feel like we're best friends.

47:47.160 --> 47:48.434
Is it weird if we're already best friends?

47:48.520 --> 47:51.910
No. No. Yeah.

47:56.280 --> 47:59.113
Hey, guys.
It's Kayla, back with another video.

48:00.400 --> 48:03.597
So today, I want to talk
to you guys about growing up.

48:04.920 --> 48:08.117
Okay, so growing up can be
a little bit scary and weird,

48:08.200 --> 48:11.317
but it's also a really good thing
because you get to change things

48:11.400 --> 48:12.992
that you might not like about yourself,

48:13.080 --> 48:15.548
and that's good because
change is a good thing.

48:17.240 --> 48:18.673
Okay, so I'm an eighth grader,

48:18.760 --> 48:21.194
which means next year
I will be in high school.

48:21.640 --> 48:24.108
Now, high school is a lot different
than middle school

48:24.200 --> 48:28.273
because middle school is like,
really... well...

48:28.640 --> 48:30.551
Middle school is, like, in the middle.

48:31.440 --> 48:32.668
And in middle school,

48:32.760 --> 48:35.479
everyone is a lot younger
than high schoolers

48:35.560 --> 48:36.470
and, when you're young,

48:36.600 --> 48:38.591
you haven't changed
as much as when you're older.

48:40.200 --> 48:43.272
So, yeah, high schoolers have changed
more than middle schoolers,

48:43.360 --> 48:44.759
and since change is a good thing,

48:44.840 --> 48:47.354
that means that high schoolers
are really good.

48:48.080 --> 48:51.117
Uh, okay, next thing about growing up.

48:51.920 --> 48:52.955
Yeah, okay.

48:53.040 --> 48:56.396
So the thing about growing up
is that it's going to happen,

48:56.920 --> 48:58.148
so don't fight it.

48:58.640 --> 49:02.633
Some parts of growing up
will be really hard and not good,

49:02.720 --> 49:06.508
but I promise that growing up
will eventually get really good.

49:06.960 --> 49:08.678
I mean, I used to be afraid of growing up,

49:08.760 --> 49:11.035
and then I realized it's going
to make everything better,

49:11.120 --> 49:12.792
and now I can't wait to grow up.

49:18.720 --> 49:21.280
Uh, yeah. Cool.

49:21.440 --> 49:22.509
Okay.

49:22.600 --> 49:24.033
Thank you, guys, for watching this video,

49:24.120 --> 49:26.793
and make sure to share
and subscribe to my channel.

49:27.520 --> 49:29.033
Uh, yeah. Thank you, guys, for watching.

49:29.440 --> 49:30.555
Gucci.

49:52.160 --> 49:53.752
Hey, Olivia.

49:55.560 --> 49:56.549
Hey, Olivia.

49:58.840 --> 49:59.955
Uh...

50:00.840 --> 50:02.910
thanks for today.

50:04.360 --> 50:05.270
Hey.

50:23.880 --> 50:25.393
Yeah, I mean totally.

50:25.480 --> 50:28.119
No, lmean, like, honestly,
screw those girls, they're just, like,

50:28.200 --> 50:30.236
trying so hard to be cool.

50:30.320 --> 50:31.719
Pretty much.

50:32.240 --> 50:34.276
No. lmean it, Kayla.
Don't stress about that stuff.

50:35.080 --> 50:36.559
Okay, I'll try not to.

50:36.640 --> 50:39.074
No. Eighth grade is the worst.

50:39.160 --> 50:42.118
I was, like, a complete mess
when I was your age.

50:42.200 --> 50:44.634
- Really?
- Yes. Oh, my God, yes.

50:45.240 --> 50:48.915
Wow, I mean... Wow. Um...

50:49.000 --> 50:52.754
Oh, also, thanks for letting me, like,
call you and stuff

50:52.840 --> 50:55.149
because I wasn't sure if I,
you know, like, should

50:55.280 --> 50:57.430
or if that would be, like,
you know, weird or not.

50:57.520 --> 50:58.714
Oh, my God, no, no, no, no.

50:58.800 --> 51:00.916
Not weird at all.
I gave you my number, Kayla.

51:01.000 --> 51:02.752
This is... This is what it's for.

51:02.840 --> 51:05.718
Thanks. I mean, it's just really nice

51:05.800 --> 51:08.314
and kind of, like,
just awesome to be able...

51:08.400 --> 51:11.437
to be able to, like,
you know, talk to someone who's just so,

51:11.520 --> 51:13.875
like, cool and they're, like,
older and stuff.

51:13.960 --> 51:17.032
Oh, my God, well, you know,
I don't know how cool I am.

51:17.800 --> 51:21.349
Uh, I mean, I actuallythink
you're pretty cool. I mean...

51:23.360 --> 51:25.999
I don't really have, like,
a lot of friends at school or whatever

51:26.080 --> 51:28.753
because, like, people are,
like, stupid like you said.

51:28.840 --> 51:32.753
Um, but I don't know, you've just been
so nice to me and you're just...

51:32.840 --> 51:34.592
I think that makes you pretty cool.

51:35.840 --> 51:37.990
I mean, I made all my close friends
in high school.

51:38.080 --> 51:40.833
All that stuff is gonna happen for you.
Don't even worry about it.

51:41.440 --> 51:42.589
Thanks.

51:43.960 --> 51:45.188
You know, hey...

51:45.280 --> 51:47.350
I don't know if you're around
or allowed or whatever,

51:47.440 --> 51:50.512

to the mall to just, like, hang,

51:50.600 --> 51:52.750
if you feel like you wanna come.

51:55.160 --> 51:56.798

51:59.360 --> 52:01.555
Oh, my God.

52:02.240 --> 52:03.912
Oh, my God. Okay.

really bad reception at my house. Um...

52:17.720 --> 52:19.438

52:19.520 --> 52:20.714
Oh, my gosh, yes. Please come.

52:20.800 --> 52:23.553
Oh, okay. Okay, cool. Cool.
Cool. Cool. Cool. Awesome.

52:23.640 --> 52:25.949
Great. Okay. Uh, yeah.

52:26.800 --> 52:29.075
- Text me later.
- Yeah! Okay, see ya!

52:29.160 --> 52:30.718
- Okay. See you. Bye.
- Okay, bye.

52:30.800 --> 52:31.835
Cool. Yeah.

53:05.160 --> 53:06.718
Oh, fuck.

53:24.520 --> 53:25.839
- Dad?
- Yeah?

53:26.800 --> 53:27.710
What's up?

53:33.720 --> 53:34.709
Is something wrong?

53:36.240 --> 53:37.958
Can I go out with friends tonight?

53:50.840 --> 53:52.671
Can you not look like that, please?

53:52.760 --> 53:54.637
What?

53:54.720 --> 53:55.835
Like what?

53:55.960 --> 53:57.279
Just, like, the way you're looking.

53:58.120 --> 53:59.235
Looking at the road?

53:59.320 --> 54:01.231
You can look at the road, Dad.
I obviously didn't mean that.

54:01.320 --> 54:03.993
Just, like, don't be weird
and quiet while you do it.

54:05.520 --> 54:06.509
Sorry.

54:08.880 --> 54:09.835
Hey, how was the shadow thing?

54:09.920 --> 54:13.037
No, you were being quiet, which is fine.
Just, like, don't be weird and quiet

54:13.120 --> 54:14.712
because, like, I look over at you,
and I think

54:14.800 --> 54:16.313
you're about to drive us
into a tree or something,

54:16.440 --> 54:18.476
and then I get really freaked out,
and then I can't text my friends.

54:18.560 --> 54:22.633
So just, like, be quiet and drive.
And don't look weird and sad.

54:23.680 --> 54:24.590
Please.

54:26.760 --> 54:27.988
Okay.

54:35.080 --> 54:36.195
That's worse.

55:47.000 --> 55:48.399
...that was two years ago.

55:48.480 --> 55:49.595
He's still dead.

55:49.680 --> 55:51.432
- Think of it.
- I'm acknowledging that.

55:51.520 --> 55:55.479
I'm just saying, what, we have a triathlon
for a kid that died two years ago?

55:55.560 --> 55:56.470
- Oh, my God.
- Okay...

55:56.560 --> 55:58.516
No one was running for him then.
He was fat then.

55:58.600 --> 55:59.794
- Oh, my God!
- I don't get why,

55:59.880 --> 56:02.075
like, everyone has to act like
they're his best friend.

56:02.160 --> 56:05.072
No, it's because he died.
His whole future was stripped from him.

56:05.160 --> 56:06.388
Did you at least
put a candle down?

56:06.480 --> 56:09.233
That doesn't mean
he was a special person.

56:09.320 --> 56:12.949
Oh, my God, you are the most...
You are such an insensitive asshole.

56:13.040 --> 56:15.838
Every single school has a dead
kid! You guys are just following...

56:15.920 --> 56:17.831
- We're following...
- We're following?

56:17.920 --> 56:19.876
- You don't even know him.
- You're supposed to show respect.

56:19.960 --> 56:21.029
I'm respecting him by...

56:21.120 --> 56:22.269
- Hey.
- Oh, my God, Kayla!

56:22.360 --> 56:24.078
Wait, hi. Guys, guys, guys.

56:24.160 --> 56:25.878
Okay, so this is Kayla. Sorry.

56:25.960 --> 56:29.032
She's, like, super chill and amazing
and also she's my shadow.

56:29.120 --> 56:31.793
And, yeah, this is Aniyah,

56:32.200 --> 56:34.555
and you guys met today. Riley and Trevor.

56:34.640 --> 56:36.915
- Trevor.
- The whole... the whole gang.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.514
- Are you hungry?
- Uh, I'm fine.

56:39.600 --> 56:42.239
Okay, well, we're gonna...
We're gonna eat, I think.

56:42.320 --> 56:44.038
Oh, well, I'll grab food, then.

56:44.120 --> 56:45.917
Okay. Okay, cool. Cool.

56:46.000 --> 56:46.910
Yay.

56:47.720 --> 56:49.039
My phone...

56:49.120 --> 56:52.032
All that he did was he put
his arm on your shoulder.

56:53.240 --> 56:55.231
That's perv...
Are you defending this perv?

56:55.840 --> 56:57.239
Why are you defending him?

56:57.320 --> 56:58.469
Why would he...
Why would he wanna look at...?

56:58.480 --> 56:58.593
Why would he...
Why would he wanna look at...?

56:58.600 --> 56:59.669
Why would he...
Why would he wanna look at...?

56:59.760 --> 57:01.591
- Why would...
- Why wouldn't he?

57:03.080 --> 57:05.913
Oh, my God. Wait, wait, wait.
Did I tell you guys?

57:06.000 --> 57:07.035
- What?
- Do you know Brian?

57:07.120 --> 57:08.838
- Yeah, of course.
- Your friend, Brian. Right.

57:08.920 --> 57:10.911
- We all know Brian.
- So, he DM'ed me the other day, right?

57:11.000 --> 57:13.560
So, I thought it was a regular
DM until I opened it.

57:13.640 --> 57:15.073
It's literallyjust a picture,

57:15.200 --> 57:17.998
a cropped picture that I posted
the other day, of just my feet.

57:18.120 --> 57:18.916
Of your feet?

57:19.000 --> 57:20.752
- His feet?
- No. My feet.

57:20.840 --> 57:22.319
- He DM'ed me a picture of my feet.
- That is so weird.

57:22.400 --> 57:23.799
Right? Isn't that so creepy?

57:23.880 --> 57:26.075
No, he was...
He was just trying to flirt with you.

57:26.160 --> 57:26.990
He was being nice.

57:27.080 --> 57:28.672
That's not being nice. That's being pervy.

57:28.760 --> 57:31.035
- He's a perv.
- You know what a perv is.

57:31.120 --> 57:33.350
- That's really weird.

57:33.440 --> 57:35.396
What's funny about that, Riley?

57:35.480 --> 57:37.914
I don't know.
Just the way he said it was...

57:38.000 --> 57:39.797
- How did he say it?

57:40.400 --> 57:42.595
What? Why am I being yelled at?

57:42.680 --> 57:45.035
This is yelling to you?
No, this is an adult tone.

57:45.120 --> 57:47.076
This is the volume that adults use.

57:47.160 --> 57:49.469
Not that quiet,
little mouse shit that you do.

57:49.560 --> 57:52.074
I don't understand why you can't
just speak up for yourself.

57:52.160 --> 57:54.355
Riley's a thinker.
- Oh, he's a thinker? That's what it is?

57:55.040 --> 57:58.157
You know, I used to be, like,
really quiet too.

57:59.480 --> 58:00.754
Oh, I'm not quiet.

58:01.280 --> 58:03.840
- No. You're quiet.

58:03.920 --> 58:05.512
Look who's talking for himself.

58:05.600 --> 58:06.794
I'm not screaming at anybody!

58:06.920 --> 58:09.639
Oh! That's not screaming, what?

58:10.000 --> 58:12.355
- I was...
- I will record you and play it back.

58:12.440 --> 58:13.793
Show you that you're yelling.

58:14.320 --> 58:15.958
- Are you bored, Kayla?
- Huh?

58:16.440 --> 58:18.715
You look bored.

58:18.800 --> 58:20.313
- I'm not bored.
- Trev. Stop.

58:20.400 --> 58:21.799
- You don't have to answer.
- What? No. I'm notjudging her.

58:21.880 --> 58:23.598
It's fine. We're boring her.

58:23.680 --> 58:24.715
She's a different generation than us.

58:24.800 --> 58:26.677
She's not a different generation.

58:26.760 --> 58:27.795
Yes, she is.

58:27.880 --> 58:29.438
She's four years younger than us.

58:29.520 --> 58:31.829
Okay, but people who were,
like, four years older than us

58:31.920 --> 58:33.876
felt, like, fucking 50 years old.

58:33.960 --> 58:35.678
That's, like, blatantly not true.

58:35.760 --> 58:37.796
- Your sister.
- My sister just sucks.

58:37.880 --> 58:40.155
Okay, but, like, on top of that,

58:40.240 --> 58:42.276
she didn't have Twitter
in middle school, and we did.

58:42.360 --> 58:43.634
That made us different.

58:44.320 --> 58:45.548
Kayla, you're not different than us.

58:46.240 --> 58:48.800
Yeah... When did you get Snapchat?
What grade?

58:49.400 --> 58:50.674
Fifth grade.

58:50.760 --> 58:53.035
Fifth grade? What? No, see!

58:53.120 --> 58:55.793
Wait, so were kids sending each other
nudes in fifth grade?

58:55.880 --> 58:56.995
No, okay, that is a weird question.

58:57.080 --> 58:59.036
What? I'm just asking a question.

58:59.120 --> 59:00.439
That is a pervy question.

59:00.520 --> 59:04.069
She's seeing dicks in fifth grade,
she's, like, wired differently.

59:04.160 --> 59:06.515
She's not wired different.

59:07.480 --> 59:09.948
I'm not saying it's, like,
a bad thing. I'm just making...

59:10.040 --> 59:12.270
Dude, stop. Stop. Let's stop this.

59:12.400 --> 59:14.960
- Let's stop this, now.
- Jesus Christ. Fine!

59:15.040 --> 59:16.473
- We're moving on.
- I'm just making a fun point.

59:16.560 --> 59:18.755
Okay, fun point made. Let's go. Okay.

59:19.400 --> 59:21.038
Dude, don't bring me into this shit.

59:22.680 --> 59:26.275
I actually like the filters
on Snapchat and stuff.

59:26.360 --> 59:28.430
- Those are cool.
- Yeah. Me too.

59:29.400 --> 59:31.755
Okay. guys,
don't all look at the same time,

59:32.120 --> 59:35.590
but some creepy ass dude
has been staring at us for so long...

59:35.680 --> 59:37.033
- Oh?
- Don't. Don't...

59:37.120 --> 59:38.917
lsee him, in the...

59:42.480 --> 59:45.153
Uh, I left something in a store.
I'll be back.

59:45.560 --> 59:46.436
Do you want me to...?

59:47.840 --> 59:49.671
- Really nice.
- What? I didn't do anything.

59:49.760 --> 59:50.749
Okay. Stop.

59:53.680 --> 59:55.910
Hey, honey.
- Get away from me!

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:16.112
I'm really sorry.

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:22.359
I didn't mean to spy on you.

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:25.910
I just suck, I...

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:28.549
I'm just...

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:31.996
You see, sometimes,
dads are just really weird

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:33.399
and I'm just being weird.

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:39.835
Uh, all right. I'm...
You know, I'm just gonna...

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:44.318
You know, I'm just gonna get out of here.
I'm just gonna go, and you just...

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.595
have fun with your friends and just
text me when you want me to pick you up.

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:47.749
I'll get a ride home.

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:51.515
Okay.

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:56.949
Yeah. All right, so, yeah.
Just have fun and...

01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:58.678
Here, why don't you...

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:01.238
take this and get yourself, like, a...

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:03.239
a pretzel or something.

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.510
Okay. I'm just going to leave it here.

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:12.949
And, yeah. Just have fun, and...

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:15.631
All right. I'm sorry.

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:39.631
Aniyah and Trev need to chill.

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:42.188
I know. It's like I can't
say anything around them.

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:43.918
They can just be a lot sometimes.

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:47.555
- You have fun tonight, Kayla?
- Yeah. Totally.

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:49.075
Good.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:52.352
She's just, like, so fun
and easy to be around, isn't she?

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:53.509
Totally.

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:55.314
You know, I was...

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:56.873
I was just, like,
sitting there or whatever,

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.552
like, watching you guys eat,

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:01.757
and all I was thinking was, like,
you guys are just so cool.

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:04.513
- I think you're cool!

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:05.749
You wanna drop her off first?

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:08.397
I mean, you're right here.

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:10.391
Yeah, but it's late.
We should get her home.

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:11.879
No, it's fine.

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.152
- Yeah? You sure?
- Yeah.

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:16.238
All good.

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:17.833
Okay, cool.

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.475
This was the best.

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.272
Let's do it again soon.

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:27.196
Um, you're awesome.
You rule. You're great.

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.793
Bye. Good night.

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:31.311
- Good night, Riley.
- Bye.

01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:37.679
Olivia's cool, yeah?

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:41.669
Yeah, totally. She's, like, the best.

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.716
Yeah, we're, like, best friends.

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.392
- Heh. Really?
- Yeah.

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:47.992
That's awesome.

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:52.553
Kind of awkward talking
when you're in the back seat.

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:55.470
Yeah.

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:57.312
Here, hold on.

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:05.154
- Uh, Should I get in the front?
- No. No, no, no, it's all good.

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:26.160
So... you excited about next year?

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:29.477
Yeah, totally.
- Yeah. Totally. I mean, you should be.

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.949
You're like the coolest freshman
I've ever met,

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:33.712
and you're not even a freshman yet.

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:36.791
- Thanks.
- It's crazy.

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:40.509
Yeah. I mean, you should
watch out for guys, definitely.

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:41.589
Like...

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:43.033
They're gonna try to pick you up,
you know?

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:45.350
- Yeah.
- Really?

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:47.032
Yeah. I mean, definitely.

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:49.908
- Yeah, right.
- No. I'm serious.

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:54.796
Hmm.

01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:57.675
Truth or dare?

01:03:58.560 --> 01:03:59.959
Uh, what?

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:02.600
Oh, truth or dare?
You ever play Truth or Dare?

01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:05.679
- Yeah. Sorry.
- Yeah? Yeah?

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:06.829
Truth or dare?

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:10.036
Uh, truth.

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:12.877
Okay. Uh...

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:17.434
How far have you gone?

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:21.591
- How far have I gone?
- Yeah. Yeah, like...

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:24.713
- first base, or...
- Oh, okay, yeah.

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:26.552
Yeah. Okay. Uh...

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:30.598
I don't know. Do you mean, like, you know,

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:34.713
all time or, like, more recent, or...

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:36.074
Let's go all time.

01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:38.671
Well, okay then...

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:42.318
Uh, I don't know. I'd say, like...

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:46.869
you know, third base.

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.592
- Whoa!
- Yeah.

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:52.513
Sorry, just kidding.
I meant second, you know.

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:56.354
I get second and third, like,
mixed up a lot, you know.

01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:58.433
- You're funny.

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:01.030
I mean, it's okay
if you haven't done anything.

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:03.309
Yeah.

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:06.430
Hmm.

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:09.913
You wanna ask me?

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:13.034
Uh, okay. Yeah.

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:18.192
Uh, how far have you...

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:20.191
Oh, no. No. Truth or dare.

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:22.794
Right.
- It starts there, and then...

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:28.439
Uh, okay, well, truth or dare.

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:30.549
I'll take dare.

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:32.675
Okay...

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.919
Uh, put this quarter in your mouth.

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:44.633
- Ew!

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:47.314
Yeah. Sorry, that was gross.

01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:49.748
No, it's...

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:53.233
Okay, well, like, you know, uh...

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:57.032
What do you...
What do you want to do? You know.

01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:01.119
You can pick.

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:08.518
I don't know. Shit! Um...

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:10.749
So much.

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:18.439
I could take my shirt off?

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:20.833
I mean, that's stupid though.

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:23.319
Is that stupid?

01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:25.631
- Uh, no.
- No?

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:27.149
That's fine.

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:30.038
- Fuck. lfeel like a fucking idiot.

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.999
Is it fine if I take my shirt off?

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:34.832
Yeah? Okay. I don't know. All right.

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:36.435
Gonna do it.

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:51.434
Truth or dare?

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:53.789
Uh...

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:57.236
Uh, truth.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:00.388
You're no fun.

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:03.953
Uh, sorry.

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:05.594
Okay, well...

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:07.789
dare.

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:17.109
Take your shirt off.

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:24.714
Uh, I'm not, like,
super comfortable with that.

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:26.995
Well, do you think
I'm comfortable right now?

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:31.114
- I don't know...
- Calm down, relax.

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.430
Take a deep breath. Come on.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.592
- Take your shirt off.
- No!

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:36.669
Sorry.

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:04.478
- I'm really sorry.
- It's fine.

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:09.678
- I'm sorry.
- Stop saying you're sorry.

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:12.957
I said it was fine, dude. Okay?
So, stop saying that, okay?

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:17.349
You know, and now you're gonna
have your first hookup

01:08:17.439 --> 01:08:19.908
with some asshole at a party,
and you're not gonna be good at it,

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.831
and he's gonna tell
all his friends about it,

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:23.716
and you're gonna get made
fun of and feel like shit.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:25.392
- Do you want that?
- No.

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:28.671
This was about you. Okay?

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:31.718
I'm... I'm trying...
I was trying to help you, okay?

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:33.755
I know.

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:36.676
I really appreciate it. I just...

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:43.273
I'm sorry. I mean... ltwasjust...

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:47.109
It was a lot at once, you know. I...

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:48.679
I don't know, I just... l...

01:08:49.279 --> 01:08:52.238
I didn't want to do that right now.

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:01.871
Please don't tell Olivia about this.

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:18.069
Night.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.513
Hey. How'd it...

01:09:48.399 --> 01:09:49.389
Honey?

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:52.229
Kayla?

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:07.438
Hey, guys.
It's Kayla, back with another video.

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:10.189
Um, so...

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:14.072
I'm making this video to just

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:17.759
kind of say that I'm not gonna
be making videos anymore.

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:22.673
Or, you know,
I'm taking a break or something. Um...

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:26.273
And I don't...

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:31.516
I don't know if anyone is, like,
really watching or cares,

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:33.875
um, but if you are...

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:36.951
sorry if this is, like, a bummer to you.

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:39.032
Um, but...

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:41.718
it's the right thing to do.

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:48.511
I started making videos, you know,
to, like, give tips and stuff.

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:51.239
And, you know, help you guys out, but...

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:53.669
I don't know.

01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:59.550
If I'm being really honest,
I'm probably not, like,

01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:01.393
the best person to give advice

01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:05.758
because I like, you know,
I like giving advice

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:08.673
and, like, and talking about doing stuff,

01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:12.878
but I can't really actually do that stuff.

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.996
And... Yeah.

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:22.429
And...

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.355
I don't know.

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:27.589
It's just, like...

01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:32.759
urn, I'm really, like, nervous
all the time, and...

01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:38.588
Like, I could be doing nothing,
and I'm just...

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:41.079
nervous. It's like...

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:45.109
It's like I could...

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:48.476
I'm waiting in line for, like,
a roller coaster, and...

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:50.792
that stupid, like,

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:54.192
butterflies-in-your-stomach
feeling you get, like...

01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:56.309
I get that all the time,

01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:59.676
and then I never get the feeling
of after you ride the roller coaster,

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:02.033
and l...

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:04.551
I try really hard not to feel that way.

01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:07.109
But...

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:09.876
I don't know. I just...

01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:12.315
can't...

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:20.351
So, I think if you guys are going through,
like, tough times and stuff,

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:23.791
you deserve someone who can...

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:26.635
go through tough times

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:29.917
and make themselves
feel better with their advice,

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.833
and actually do the stuff they talk about.

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:34.114
You know, just...

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:39.273
If they can make themselves feel better,
then maybe they can help you feel better.

01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:47.351
So, yeah, I think those are the reasons
why I'm gonna stop making videos.

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:49.278
And, yeah.

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:49.359
And, yeah.

01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:50.076
And, yeah.

01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:56.990
I hope you guys all have,
like, you know, good lives,

01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:59.196
and maybe I'll see you guys around.

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:01.669
Bye.

01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:03.355
Gucci.

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:39.115
Hey, Kayla! It's you. Kayla.

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:43.509
I'm just making this video to congratulate
you on finishing eighth grade.

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:44.715
Whoo-hoo!

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:48.793
I am so, so, so, so proud of you!

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:54.118
Okay, so I'm making this video
on a Friday.

01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:56.875
And, yeah, Fridays are really fun.

01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:59.952
And I'm about to have my first
middle school weekend.

01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:03.751
Um, and I bet it's not really
exciting to you, or whatever,

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:06.035
because you've already had
a bunch of middle school weekends,

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:08.190
but it's really exciting to me.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.754
Yeah, lhave, like,
so many questions for you also.

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:14.911
Like, do you have a boyfriend?

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.877
And is he nice?

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:20.032
What's the coolest thing you've done,
or the second coolest thing you've done?

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:24.229
Uh, yeah, so you don't have to answer
because I can't hear you anyways.

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:26.470
But, yeah, thanks for listening. Bye...

01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:54.316
Can you help me burn something
in the backyard?

01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:58.997
Yes.

01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:07.473
You sure you want to do this?

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:11.955
Yeah.

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:16.640
I'm not exactly sure what "this" is or...

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:19.275
means.

01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:24.871
I just hope that whatever we're doing here
is a positive thing?

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:28.595
Yeah.

01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:33.789
All right, then.

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.349
What was in there?

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:06.032
Nothing, really.

01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:11.391
Just sort of my hopes and dreams.

01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:15.190
Right.

01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:19.549
And you're burning them?

01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:22.389
Yeah.

01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:40.508
- Do I make you sad?
- What? Huh?

01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:42.349
No.

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:44.233
No, not at all.

01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:48.517
Not at all. Why? Do I seem sad?

01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:51.630
No.

01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:56.715
What? Why would you think you make me sad?

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:02.717
I don't know, it's just...

01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:09.715
Sometimes, you know,
I think that when I'm older, you know,

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:13.836
maybe I'll have a daughter of my own
or something, and...

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:23.360
lfeel like, you know,
if she was like me, um...

01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:28.673
then being her mom would
make me sad all the time.

01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:33.516
Because, like, you know, I'd love her
because she's my daughter,

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:35.951
you know, but...

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:39.514
I don't know, I just...

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:45.079
think if she turned out like me that...

01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:49.070
being her mom would make me really sad.

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:52.713
You're wrong.

01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:57.555
Kayla... Kayla, hey, look at me.

01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:00.190
Look at me. You're wrong.

01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:04.111
If you grow up to have
a daughter like you,

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:06.790
she will make you so, so happy.

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:09.269
Being your dad makes me so happy, Kayla.

01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:13.672
You don't know.
You don't know how happy you make me.

01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:15.159
It's beyond... It's...

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:18.797
I can't describe it. It's...

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:25.556
It's so easy to love you.
It's so easy to be proud of you.

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:28.113
I'm not just saying this.

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:30.470
Hey, I swear to God,
I'm not just saying this.

01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:34.758
I mean, sure, sometimes,
if I see you're upset or having a...

01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:38.071
a rough day, then I feel sad.

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:40.195
But...

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.036
that kind of being sad, that sort of...

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:47.873
day-to-day sad,
or worrying that I do, that's not...

01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:52.673
Kayla, always,

01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:58.189
beneath all that, I am always
just so unbelievably happy

01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:00.157
that I get to be your dad.

01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:18.517
When Mom left, I was really scared.

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:22.437
I was really, really scared. I...

01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:25.631
I was scared you weren't gonna be okay.

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:30.318
And then you started to get older.

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:32.075
And you got...

01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:36.474
I don't know. You took your first steps,
and you said your first words,

01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:39.160
and you made your first friend.

01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:42.598
All the things I thought I was
going to have to teach you.

01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:48.316
How to be nice, how to share, how to...

01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:52.112
care about other people's feelings.

01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:56.233
You just started doing that on your own.

01:20:57.880 --> 01:20:59.677
You know, your teachers
would always say to me,

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:03.155
"You've got such a lovely daughter.

01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:05.470
You've done such a great job with her."

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:08.312
But I didn't do anything.

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:10.074
I really didn't.

01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:12.431
I really didn't. I just...

01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:15.154
watched you.

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:18.071
And the more I watched you...

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:20.712
the less scared I got.

01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:24.479
Does that make sense?

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:30.430
I stopped being scared about
whether you were going to be okay...

01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:34.559
a long time ago.

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:42.315
Do you know why?

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:46.515
Because of you.

01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:50.510
You make me brave.

01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:55.398
And if you could just see yourself
how I see you, which is...

01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:57.389
how you are...

01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:00.394
how you really are,
how you always have been,

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:02.990
I swear to God,
you wouldn't be scared either.

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:23.113
Friends, family, and loved ones.

01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:25.949
Today is a celebration.

01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:31.116
A chance for us to applaud
the achievements of these amazing kids,

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:34.715
Miles Grove Middle School's Class of 2017.

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:43.032
Soon, these kids will embark
on the next chapter of their lives.

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:46.749
Everybody, please, shh.

01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:51.831
Hey, guys, guys, guys, come on, please.

01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:56.828
Shh. Just a few minutes.

01:22:58.520 --> 01:22:59.839
Okay, please.

01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:03.069
Shh. Please, thank you.

01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:33.032
Hey. I wrote you that letter

01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:34.997
thanking you for inviting me
to your birthday party,

01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:36.593
and you didn't write back or anything!

01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:39.194
I didn't even get a DM on,
like, Instagram or whatever.

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:41.669
And you know what?
You're always mean to me,

01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:44.320
and I'm always nice to you,
and being mean isn't nice.

01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:45.958
And when somebody does
something nice to you,

01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:47.229
you're supposed to be nice back,

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:48.753
and you're always mean to me,
and I know...

01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:51.638
I'm a good person because
I'm always nice to you, and you're just...

01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:53.672
And, also, that card game I got you

01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:55.512
is, like, a really fun version
of Go Fish or whatever,

01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:59.195
and you'd actually know if you played it
instead of trying to be cool all the time.

01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:02.750
It's, like, dumb, or whatever,
but you know...

01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:05.638
it's dumb in a way that's fun
to play when it's raining outside,

01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:08.109
and you'd know that if you stopped
trying to be cool all the time!

01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:09.155
And...

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:15.870
Welcome.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:19.910
Wow.

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:21.270
Thank you.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.719
- Would you like to take a seat?
- Oh. Uh, sure.

01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:27.270
Cool.

01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:31.632
You like chicken nuggets, right?

01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:33.312
- Yeah.
- Okay. Cool.

01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:36.951
I got a 20-piece, and I also
got two of every kind of sauce.

01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:38.917
But, you know, if you have
a favorite sauce, and you want

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.319
more than one packet of it,
you can have mine.

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:41.833
I like all the sauces equally.

01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:43.239
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:47.792
Oh, and the nuggets have been
sitting out for a little bit

01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:49.950
because, you know,
I didn't know when you'd be here,

01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:51.917
so just tell me if they're too cold,

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.797
and I can heat them up
in the microwave over there, okay?

01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:01.156
Oh. Woops. Sorry, must have left this out
by accident. Sorry.

01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:02.269
I'm so stupid.

01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:04.273
Um, no problem.

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:06.795
You want to see it?
No, wait. No, it's stupid.

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:08.110
Sure.

01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:10.353
Okay. Yeah.

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:11.950
Cool.

01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:13.755
What is it?

01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:15.432
Oh, well, I go to archery camp
every summer.

01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:17.875
And last summer, I got five bull's-eyes
in a day, so, you know,

01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:20.190
they gave me the
Sharpshooter of the Week Award.

01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:22.112
That's actually really cool.

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:25.158
Yeah, not really. It's... It's stupid.

01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:30.236
Um, I think it's really cool, but...

01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:33.312
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Well, I think it's stupid. Yeah.

01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:37.956
Okay. Yeah.
To our first friend hangout, I guess.

01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:39.712
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:42.469
Oops.

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:53.868
Do you believe in God?

01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:59.518
Um... Yes.

01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:00.589
Okay. Cool.

01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:03.954
You like the silverware?

01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:07.274
- Yeah. It's really cool.
- Yeah. It's a lightsaber.

01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:08.509
Check it out.

01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:17.399
I've seen some of your videos.

01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:19.038
- Oh, those are really dumb.
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:20.348
They're actually really cool.

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:22.510
- I love those videos.

01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:24.431
You're really...
You're really smart about stuff.

01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:26.192
Like, you know a lot of things.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:27.910
Thanks.

01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:31.636
I was thinking you should, maybe you can
have your own talk show or something.

01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:33.597
Yeah.

01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:37.995
Am I being weird at all to you?

01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:39.195
- Like...
- No, no, no.

01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:41.350
- Okay. Good. I'm just nervous.
- You're fine.

01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:43.351
No, no, no. It's fine.

01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:44.873
- I am, too. Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:50.952
Um... Am I being, like, quiet?

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:52.393
- Or too, like...
- No way.

01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:54.152
Okay, am I, like, talking enough?

01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:56.196
You've been pretty talkative,
but not in an annoying way.

01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:58.111
Just responding to me, you know.

01:26:58.200 --> 01:26:59.315
Thanks. Yeah.

01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:02.953
This is a... this is a good conversation,
don't you think?

01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:06.476
Yeah. We're doing some good talking.

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:08.232
Yeah. It's a nice chat.

01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:09.949
Yep.

01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:12.791
- You know what would go great with this?
- Hmm?

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:14.509
Some Szechuan sauce!

01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:16.998
- You like Rick and Marty, too?
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:18.308
- Nice.
- Yes!

01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:20.152
Yes, Morty. The Szechuan sauce!

01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:21.719
We gotta... We gotta get it, Morty.

01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:22.909
Come on, Morty, come on!

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:23.910
Oh, jeez, Rick.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.513
- Shut up. Morty, yes!
- Rick, I don't know!

01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:28.592
That's so cool.
- Yes, Morty. Keep...

01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:30.438
Keep doing the voice, Morty.
Yes, of course.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.831
That show's amazing.
- Yeah.

01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:37.955
Hmm. You are awesome.

01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:41.555
Thanks.

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:44.309
No problem.

01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:56.469
You have fun?

01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:59.753
Yeah. Yeah, it was a lot of fun.

01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:02.510
Good.

01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:26.189
Hey, Kayla. It's you, from eighth grade.

01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:30.199
Congrats on finishing high school.
I'm so proud of you.

01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:34.315
And it's crazy to think that, like,
you're almost 18.

01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:39.231
Um, and I bet you probably look a lot
different than me, which is cool.

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:44.156
Or, if you don't, and you look, you know,
mostly the same, that's cool too.

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:47.912
How did you do on the SATs?
I mean, hopefully good.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.834
But if not, you know, school sucks.

01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:53.990
Especially math. Um...

01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:55.719
Uh, what else?

01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:58.919
Um, do you have a boyfriend?

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:01.510
It's cool if you don't, but if you do,

01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:03.989
he should be treating you well
because you deserve it.

01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:07.999
Is Dad still a dork?

01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:11.959
Because, if he's not, he's probably just
someone pretending to be Dad.

01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:15.435
- Smell it. Smell it.
- Dad, stop. Dad! Dad!

01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:20.116
And I really hope that
you're not too sad about, like,

01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:21.758
leaving all your friends for college,

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:24.070
but you can still stay
in contact with them.

01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:27.159
And if you don't, that's fine.

01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:30.915
Because you'll make new friends at
college anyway, so it's, like, whatever.

01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:35.116
And I know, like,
you probably don't want any advice

01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:37.794
from some dumb eighth-grader or whatever,

01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:39.677
but if high school sucked for you,

01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:43.912
I'm really sorry about that.
And that, you know, that sucks.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.956
But I mean, it's whatever.

01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:50.033
Middle school wasn't so great for me,
but I'm past it now.

01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:54.875
And I'm moving forward,
and you can do that too with high school

01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:56.439
if it didn't go great.

01:29:57.560 --> 01:30:00.393
Just because things are
happening to you right now

01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:03.597
doesn't mean that they're
always gonna happen to you.

01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:06.116
And things will change. And...

01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:09.956
you know, you never know
what's gonna, like, happen next,

01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:13.430
and that's what makes things
exciting and scary.

01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:15.749
And fun.

01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:22.711
Yeah, okay. So, stay cool,
and I can't wait to be you.

01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:26.637
Love, Kayla.

01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:29.599
