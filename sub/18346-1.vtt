02:11.240 --> 02:14.860
Fuck! You guys!
Richard!

02:14.860 --> 02:18.670
God! Oh, God! Help!

02:25.770 --> 02:30.520
Oh, God! Get him off!
Get him off!

02:40.260 --> 02:44.660
God! Oh, God! No! No!

02:57.540 --> 03:01.780
Hold his head!
Hold his head!

03:03.780 --> 03:06.510
Hold his head!

03:06.810 --> 03:09.510
God!

03:09.940 --> 03:12.810
Timmy! Tim!

03:12.810 --> 03:14.320
Tim!

03:14.560 --> 03:17.130
- God!
- C'mon! Tim! Tim!

03:17.600 --> 03:19.990
Tim! C'mon! C'mon!

03:19.990 --> 03:22.630
C'mon! Do it!
Hit it!

03:29.640 --> 03:33.140
- Timmy! Timmy! I got you!
- Rich?

03:33.830 --> 03:35.550
He's dead.

03:35.750 --> 03:37.640
- What's going on?
- He's fucking dead!

03:37.640 --> 03:39.730
- What's going on?
- He's gone!

03:39.730 --> 03:42.810
- Won't you listen to me? He's gone.
- Are you out of your fuckin'--What happened?

03:42.810 --> 03:45.090
He's dead! Our fucking friend is gone!

06:14.490 --> 06:17.160
The fucker beat me to the punch.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.340
Somebody help me,

06:20.670 --> 06:23.290
because I...
I'm lost here.

06:23.290 --> 06:25.290
I'm not.

06:27.410 --> 06:30.230
I remember everything.

06:31.270 --> 06:33.060
Senior year.

06:33.730 --> 06:36.940
The room upstairs.
The green couch.

06:36.940 --> 06:39.800
The slanted walls.
The <i>Joy Division</i> posters all over the

06:39.800 --> 06:42.120
walls like it was yesterday.

06:42.120 --> 06:45.250
It was Timmy's idea.
He said,

06:45.880 --> 06:48.140
"Will we ever
remember this moment,

06:48.140 --> 06:50.250
when we were friends

06:50.250 --> 06:54.000
like this? Will we
ever feel this way again?

06:54.340 --> 06:56.320
This alive?

06:56.320 --> 06:57.950
This free?

06:57.950 --> 07:00.450
this possible, again?"

07:00.950 --> 07:03.770
Oh, God, I...

07:04.520 --> 07:07.680
I'll never forget it, and yet,

07:09.520 --> 07:11.610
we forgot it.

07:11.870 --> 07:15.250
We all did.
We all forgot it.

07:16.180 --> 07:17.950
Tim didn't.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.200
Look,

07:21.470 --> 07:24.690
we all said a lot of things
when we were young.

07:28.370 --> 07:31.840
So this...this means nothing to you.

07:32.030 --> 07:34.650
- Your word's no good.
- Look,

07:34.850 --> 07:37.940
- we're going to call the police now, right?
- And say what?

07:37.940 --> 07:39.770
That we signed an oath,

07:39.770 --> 07:41.320
and now our friend is dead.

07:41.320 --> 07:45.150
- Please come pick up the body.
- Who gives a fucking shit?

07:49.160 --> 07:51.650
Timmy obviously did.

07:51.650 --> 07:53.920
I mean,
he remembered

07:53.920 --> 07:56.260
what we wanted to be, and...

07:57.940 --> 07:58.810
so do I.

07:58.810 --> 08:01.710
This is insane, by the way.
We are high.

08:01.710 --> 08:03.870
We are high as shit.

08:03.870 --> 08:05.750
Well, we just have to
think this through.

08:05.750 --> 08:07.980
Look, we just need
to come down, alright?

08:07.980 --> 08:11.120
- Sleep it off, alright?
- I can't come down.

08:11.350 --> 08:14.190
Okay, I'm confused.
Shut the fuck up.

08:14.190 --> 08:15.300
I'm confused.

08:15.300 --> 08:18.490
Are we talking about
NOT calling the cops?

08:18.490 --> 08:19.650
All our names
are on that note.

08:19.650 --> 08:22.440
That piece of fucking
shit scrawl signified

08:22.440 --> 08:24.570
means NOTHING!

08:24.570 --> 08:27.950
I'm not the same fucking
fool that signed that!

08:27.950 --> 08:30.420
Neither are you, alright?
Things change.

08:30.420 --> 08:33.570
No, you're certainly
not the same person, Ron.

08:33.570 --> 08:35.940
What the fuck does that mean?

08:35.990 --> 08:40.549
Okay, so, our bond:
no good to you.

08:40.559 --> 08:42.280
A promise we made:

08:42.280 --> 08:46.550
none of that means
anything to you.

08:47.460 --> 08:48.870
Your dead friend?

08:50.880 --> 08:54.060
It means, what we
fucking think about you.

08:54.060 --> 08:57.100
It means, that I am not
the same person.

08:57.650 --> 08:59.740
None of us are.

09:05.320 --> 09:07.430
You're not the same person.

09:07.430 --> 09:08.990
You're not the
same fucking friend.

09:08.990 --> 09:11.410
Fuck. Fuck you!
I'm a father!

09:11.410 --> 09:14.560
- And? And?
- AND SO ARE YOU!

09:14.560 --> 09:17.530
John sees his son,
what, every two weeks?

09:17.530 --> 09:21.570
And his son
calls his stepfather, Dad.

09:21.570 --> 09:24.490
You?
You write your name

09:24.490 --> 09:27.120
in blood, and it means what?

09:27.130 --> 09:30.790
Your blood means
pooey to you, so

09:31.210 --> 09:33.510
You go home, Ron.

09:33.510 --> 09:36.940
Go to your mother.
Go to your wife,

09:37.160 --> 09:39.850
who you love,

09:39.850 --> 09:43.100
and you go explain to her
how badly you fucked up, okay?

09:43.100 --> 09:46.660
You failed.
You disappoint.

09:46.870 --> 09:49.230
And how badly did
you fuck up, huh,

09:49.240 --> 09:52.380
you cocksucker?
What did you do?

09:52.840 --> 09:54.900
Bank robber? Huh?

09:54.900 --> 09:56.840
Steal people's money?

09:56.840 --> 09:59.190
Bank robber, now!
Bang! Bang! Bang!

09:59.190 --> 10:02.020
Are you the bank robber?
Tell us!

10:02.060 --> 10:05.280
Did you go bad on us?
You're a hideous man. Jonathan?

10:05.520 --> 10:07.640
Did our little Ronnie go bad on us?

10:07.640 --> 10:10.390
- Yeah, hello. We have an emergency--
- What the fuck are you doing?

10:10.390 --> 10:13.020
Someone has committed suicide.

10:13.020 --> 10:16.720
We have to call the cops.
We have to report this.

10:16.720 --> 10:19.160
- That's--
- This is who we are.

10:19.160 --> 10:22.130
- If, when we wrote it,
- Let me just get this straight.

10:22.130 --> 10:24.640
You want me
to sign off

10:24.640 --> 10:28.000
on some
25 year-old, idealistic

10:28.000 --> 10:30.990
piece of bullshit that
I don't even remember?

10:30.990 --> 10:34.130
Richard, are you
kidding me with this?

10:34.130 --> 10:36.990
This is not a reality. This has
nothing to do with now.

10:36.990 --> 10:39.750
- Tim is dead.
- No, Timmy died

10:39.750 --> 10:42.790
for his reasons.
That's right, you know.

10:42.790 --> 10:46.240
Guilt. I know he could
never live with himself.

10:46.240 --> 10:48.030
But,

10:48.660 --> 10:49.940
he did it.

10:49.940 --> 10:51.320
He was weak.

10:51.320 --> 10:54.120
That was...
That was his choice, pal.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.620
That was his life.

10:55.620 --> 10:57.120
You know what?
You never followed through on

10:57.120 --> 10:58.890
a motherfucking thing in your entire life!

10:58.890 --> 11:03.180
Not even that. You know what we
used to call you behind your back, buddy?

11:03.200 --> 11:04.970
Rat Ron.

11:05.840 --> 11:07.740
Rat Ron,

11:07.740 --> 11:11.660
'cause you were a fucking rodent.

11:11.700 --> 11:13.410
You sold us tickets

11:13.410 --> 11:15.410
to concerts that
you got for free.

11:15.410 --> 11:18.040
You were trying to
fuck Jonathan's girlfriend.

11:18.040 --> 11:21.280
Rat Fuckin' Ron.
Always had to be the man.

11:21.280 --> 11:24.090
Man with the plan.
Tell me, Ron,

11:24.290 --> 11:25.900
Tell me, Rat Ron,

11:25.900 --> 11:28.650
is that why you're
in so much trouble?

11:28.650 --> 11:30.950
Fucking loser. Where
are all your best-sellers, huh?

11:30.950 --> 11:34.000
Where are all your fucking
best-sellers, you fucking hack?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.450
You forget when Rat Ron
bailed you out of jail

11:36.450 --> 11:38.150
when we were seniors?
You forget about that?

11:38.150 --> 11:39.950
'Cause your mommy didn't
have any fucking money?

11:39.950 --> 11:41.840
Arty little Richard,

11:41.840 --> 11:43.840
with no fucking money,
and Ron had all the money,

11:43.840 --> 11:45.880
'cause that was my fucking role!

11:45.880 --> 11:47.670
You were art.
I was commerce.

11:47.670 --> 11:49.820
That's what you said.
You remember that?

11:49.820 --> 11:51.850
And you. How much money did
I make for you over the years?

11:51.850 --> 11:54.930
You fucking zombie quack fuck.

11:55.540 --> 11:57.140
Let me try to
lay this out for you

11:57.140 --> 11:59.380
in a language that
you can understand, okay?

11:59.380 --> 12:02.570
The way I see it,
you've got two choices:

12:02.570 --> 12:04.840
One, you can stay here.

12:04.840 --> 12:08.060
Two, you can die there.

12:08.060 --> 12:11.110
'Cause I've got a feeling, no matter what
kind of bullshit you wrapped yourself up into,

12:11.110 --> 12:14.430
man, you are in it so deep,
it is gonna fuck you in the ass

12:14.430 --> 12:17.380
and swallow you whole.

12:17.380 --> 12:20.830
This is insane.
This is fucking insane.

12:20.830 --> 12:23.280
Oh, my God.

12:23.280 --> 12:25.670
Fucking Timmy.

12:25.670 --> 12:28.230
I think you should leave, Ron.

12:29.170 --> 12:31.340
I think it's best.

12:32.710 --> 12:35.650
Alright, I'm going to pack up my stuff, alright?

12:35.650 --> 12:37.540
I'm gonna take off.
I'm going home.

12:38.510 --> 12:41.660
I just want to make it
clear that I left before

12:41.660 --> 12:43.950
any of this happened, alright?

12:56.920 --> 13:00.470
We should do something about Timmy.

Where's your buddy Tim?

17:03.730 --> 17:06.490
He, um...

17:07.740 --> 17:11.900
Yeah, he had some
other plans, pretty suddenly.

17:11.900 --> 17:14.190
- He had to take off.
- Yup.

17:15.030 --> 17:17.839
He must've been disappointed
to have to leave.

17:17.839 --> 17:24.240
Guess he went home sour,
'cause he didn't catch any fish.

17:24.599 --> 17:28.099

and went on home.

18:14.850 --> 18:17.580

18:48.910 --> 18:51.840

18:51.840 --> 18:53.500
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:53.500 --> 18:56.090
I know 'em.
They've been on the boat with me.

18:56.090 --> 18:58.090
and they've been hitting her real hard.

18:58.090 --> 19:00.290
Yeah, a motley crew.

19:00.290 --> 19:02.520
Not from around here.

19:34.020 --> 19:36.060
- Hi.
- Hi, um...

19:36.060 --> 19:38.170
I'm Laura Boyle.
Sorry to bother you.

19:38.170 --> 19:40.710
No bother.
What's up?

19:40.750 --> 19:45.380
The Athertons sometimes
have me pass by; check in.

19:45.380 --> 19:47.380
I was in the area.

19:47.630 --> 19:50.880
- So, it's just the four of you here?
- No, one guy took off.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.310
Who's counting?

19:55.130 --> 19:56.490
Nobody.

19:56.490 --> 19:59.940
Yeah, a buddy had to go
back to Portland for business.

20:03.620 --> 20:06.920
- Are you the doctor?
- No, he's sleeping,

20:06.920 --> 20:09.670
- after the heroics.
- Yes,

20:09.670 --> 20:12.420
- and it was heroic.
- Yeah.

20:13.590 --> 20:15.960
I've seen that Porsche somewhere.

20:15.960 --> 20:19.840
Oh, yeah, my buddy bought it off a local.

20:20.160 --> 20:22.890
- You've probably seen it around.
- Right.

20:22.890 --> 20:25.680
And the other one's mine.
It's a rental.

20:25.680 --> 20:27.910
That one? That one there?
That's yours?

20:28.640 --> 20:30.800
- What's your name?
- Ron.

20:31.790 --> 20:33.570
Why?

20:33.570 --> 20:35.740
- Something wrong?
- No.

20:35.740 --> 20:39.340
No. No, there's nothing wrong.

22:11.510 --> 22:14.060
You look like shit, Jonathan.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.370
I'm making a salad.

22:22.630 --> 22:24.500
How long has he been sleeping?

22:25.490 --> 22:26.930
Hours.

23:07.870 --> 23:09.350
Hey, Ronaldo?

23:10.110 --> 23:12.110
Hey, man,

23:12.110 --> 23:15.900
we got something.
You gotta try this.

23:17.420 --> 23:19.860
I'm so scared.

23:20.780 --> 23:24.260
About what?
Meeting Timmy?

23:25.230 --> 23:27.800
That cop that was here.
What was she doin' here?

23:33.290 --> 23:36.290
Amanda left some messages, man.

23:38.830 --> 23:41.700

55:44.400 --> 55:46.090
Hey,

55:53.690 --> 55:56.170
Why are we doing this?

56:01.550 --> 56:03.500
You don't have to do this.

56:08.760 --> 56:11.270
I'd miss my friends too much.

56:52.400 --> 56:54.510
<i>25 years from now,</i>

56:54.510 --> 56:57.380
<i>if we can't remember
what this feels like,</i>

56:57.380 --> 57:00.240
<i>and we have forgotten
this beautiful moment,</i>

57:00.240 --> 57:03.690
<i>Who we'd say we'd become,
our promise to each other,</i>

57:03.740 --> 57:06.260
<i>swearing to,
and by our friends-</i>

57:06.260 --> 57:07.550
<i>We will never forget.</i>

57:07.550 --> 57:10.880
<i>See this life,
our life,</i>

57:10.880 --> 57:12.880
<i>the one we want to live,</i>

57:13.110 --> 57:16.520
<i>the men we want to be, and will be</i>.

57:16.520 --> 57:18.760
<i>To forget this feeling is to fail.</i>

57:18.990 --> 57:23.540
<i>If we forget,
we will die as one.</i>
