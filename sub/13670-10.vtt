..the presence of tissue
other than corpus luteum.

00:05.880 --> 00:07.080
     It means you're pregnant.

00:07.080 --> 00:08.440
     It means you're pregnant.
All right!

00:08.440 --> 00:09.480
We did it!

00:09.480 --> 00:11.160
      Still can't remember your name?

00:11.160 --> 00:13.360
I need to know,
I need to know who I am.

00:13.360 --> 00:15.080
     My whole life is coming unglued.

00:15.080 --> 00:17.200
I feel like I'm on
some weird autopilot.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.520
They're not minks, Roxanne.

00:19.520 --> 00:23.280
The developmentally disabled tend
to be less inhibited about sex.

00:23.280 --> 00:24.680
I like touching.

00:24.680 --> 00:28.680
Pru, you can't go around making love
every time you feel like it.

00:29.400 --> 00:31.640
You drag your problems
into this hospital,

00:31.640 --> 00:34.680
one rotten marriage after another,
your menopausal moods

00:34.680 --> 00:38.680
and your kids calling every... Ow!

02:01.200 --> 02:02.760
             How long?

02:02.760 --> 02:05.400
Soon.

02:05.400 --> 02:08.560
   Well, can't we do something?

02:08.560 --> 02:11.360
Just be patient.

02:11.360 --> 02:13.200
 We must be able to do something.

02:13.200 --> 02:16.720
No, not really, just relax.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.520
Your family here?

02:18.520 --> 02:21.200
          My girlfriend.

02:21.200 --> 02:25.200
           I hate this.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.280
Howdy-doody, Luther.

02:49.320 --> 02:53.000
Talk about your black hole, what
happened to the emergency generator?

02:53.000 --> 02:56.440
I don't know, snowstorm knocked
out all the power. I saw it happen.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.320
The whole city just disappeared.

02:58.320 --> 03:01.320
I know, I was in the middle of
my greatest shower hits album.

03:01.320 --> 03:05.320
Think they'll let us out
of school early? Got a match?

03:06.440 --> 03:09.800

03:09.800 --> 03:12.240

03:15.000 --> 03:16.760
Ow! That's my foot!

03:16.760 --> 03:18.040
Sorry.

03:18.040 --> 03:21.680
Er...Ms Dowler, I need you to sign
this form.

03:21.680 --> 03:25.680
We'll be ready to go.
If you could just sign...

03:26.760 --> 03:30.760
Me, too.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.840
My stomach hurts worse
than before, Mommy.

03:36.840 --> 03:39.240
I feel like throwing up.

03:39.240 --> 03:42.560
I know, poor sweetheart,
we'll make it go away.

03:42.560 --> 03:44.480
I need an orderly!

03:44.480 --> 03:45.880
You rang?

03:45.880 --> 03:49.880
Yeah...Luther, would you get Miss
Dowler up to the Third Floor, 3415?

03:53.360 --> 03:54.680
I'll see you upstairs.

03:54.680 --> 03:56.920
                OK.

03:56.920 --> 03:57.960
&lt; Ow!

03:57.960 --> 03:59.040
&lt; Sorry!

03:59.040 --> 04:00.600
Come on, follow me.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.160
            I'm scared.

04:02.160 --> 04:05.360
Don't worry, the lights will be
on in the second. If you want,

04:05.360 --> 04:09.360
you can hold my hand.

04:21.560 --> 04:22.960
        Here we are, Carl.

04:22.960 --> 04:24.000
There?

04:24.000 --> 04:25.200
              Yeah...

04:25.200 --> 04:26.880
Well, I'll be!

04:26.880 --> 04:29.840
Thought for sure she was over here!

04:29.840 --> 04:33.840
 Will you get that out of my eyes?

04:36.600 --> 04:39.520
REVVING

04:39.520 --> 04:42.520
There she blows. Emergency
generator's supposed

04:42.520 --> 04:43.920
to kick in all by herself.

04:43.920 --> 04:45.360
All by herself, huh?

04:45.360 --> 04:47.160
Did you boys find the trouble?

04:47.160 --> 04:50.320
Emergency generator's
supposed to kick in all by herself.

04:50.320 --> 04:52.240
I'm aware of that,
but why didn't it?

04:52.240 --> 04:54.800
   I don't know. How about you, Kyle?

04:54.800 --> 04:55.880
Must be broken.

04:55.880 --> 04:56.920
                       Right, broken.

04:56.920 --> 04:59.680
Do you think the auxiliary
generator will keep working

04:59.680 --> 05:01.160
until the blackout's over?

05:01.160 --> 05:02.280
                             Hope so.

05:02.280 --> 05:05.360
Stay here and see that the blasted
thing does. The fate

05:05.360 --> 05:09.360
of the patients and staff
of this hospital is in your hands.

05:11.880 --> 05:15.040
God help us.

05:15.040 --> 05:19.040
These people, after walking miles
carrying their children, got in line,

05:19.120 --> 05:22.880
and they weren't even sure if there
was gonna be enough food to feed all

05:22.880 --> 05:26.520
of them. There was no pushing, no
shoving, no "me first", none of that.

05:26.520 --> 05:29.440
It changed the way I felt
about waiting.

05:29.440 --> 05:33.320
Now every time I go and buy a box
of popcorn at the movies,

05:33.320 --> 05:35.880
or wait during
rush-hour for the tea...

05:35.880 --> 05:37.080
&lt; Anybody down there?

05:37.080 --> 05:38.280
Yes, we're here!

05:38.280 --> 05:41.600
    Slide open this trap door.

05:41.600 --> 05:42.880
Anybody pregnant? &gt;

05:42.880 --> 05:43.960
         No, we just met.

05:43.960 --> 05:45.000
Anybody hurt? &gt;

05:45.000 --> 05:47.600
&lt; No, just get us out
of here, will you?

05:47.600 --> 05:49.400
We're trying, pal, we're trying. &gt;

05:49.400 --> 05:52.520
But the damper system of your
elevator car got screwed up. &gt;

05:52.520 --> 05:55.280
I don't think you'll get
power even though the lights &gt;

05:55.280 --> 05:57.040
in the rest of the building
came on. &gt;

05:57.040 --> 05:58.120
&lt; I really hate this.

05:58.120 --> 06:01.320
Take some deep breaths,

Ethiopia anyway?

06:30.320 --> 06:34.320
Oh, Dr Craig, your patient Lisa just
passed another bed pan full of blood.

06:34.640 --> 06:35.840
Hematocrit.

06:35.840 --> 06:38.880
Computer's down, it'll take me
a second to get the records.

06:38.880 --> 06:41.520
All I know is BP is 80 over 60,
pulse 120.

06:41.520 --> 06:43.280
She's dizzy and from Cincinnati.

06:43.280 --> 06:46.680
Transfuse another two units of blood
and bump the board for an OR.

06:46.680 --> 06:49.440
She has to  go back to the surgeon.

06:49.440 --> 06:53.440

You're assisting in OR.

Have you contacted Dr Chandler?
We couldn't reach him.

08:06.480 --> 08:09.760

do you always come to me?!

If we minimise the use of
electricity elsewhere

11:25.920 --> 11:28.960
and eliminate unnecessary
equipment in the OR,

11:28.960 --> 11:30.000

12:15.680 --> 12:17.960
              How so?
Well, you tell me to be patient,

12:17.960 --> 12:21.480
you say in Ethiopia, you learnt
all about waiting, then you...

12:21.480 --> 12:23.240
How are you doing down there?

12:23.240 --> 12:24.360
When are we gonna get out of here?

12:24.360 --> 12:26.080
When are we gonna get out of here?
It'll be a while.

12:26.080 --> 12:27.800
Can't you throw down a ladder?

12:27.800 --> 12:31.080
You'd fall. We're sending down
a little care package, though.

12:31.080 --> 12:33.640
Look out below! You got it?

12:33.640 --> 12:37.640
Yeah.

12:38.280 --> 12:41.640
All right, well, we'll be
in touch with you later.

12:41.640 --> 12:45.640
So what is it?

12:51.240 --> 12:55.240
There we go, that's better.

12:58.760 --> 13:02.760
Hi.

13:07.480 --> 13:11.480
(DR CRAIG) Lister operated
under better conditions.

13:11.640 --> 13:15.600
Ladies and gentlemen, emergency
surgery is hazardous enough

13:15.600 --> 13:19.600
without hindrances,
but this young girl's life

13:19.800 --> 13:22.280
can't wait for Boston Edison
to get its act together.

13:22.280 --> 13:26.120
She's relying on us
to pull her through.

13:26.120 --> 13:30.120
Now, since we have no back-up system
in this dung heap, we won't be able

13:30.400 --> 13:34.400
to use the respirator, blood warmer,
or other vital hardware.

13:35.040 --> 13:39.040
  So I expect 100% concentration,

13:39.720 --> 13:42.480
or get out of this OR are right now.

13:42.480 --> 13:45.560
             Dr Wade.

13:45.560 --> 13:47.600
(DR WADE) Ready to proceed?

13:47.600 --> 13:51.600
      Let's begin. Scalpel...

13:58.000 --> 14:01.520
You look very
handsome right now.

14:01.520 --> 14:04.280
Flame does wonders
for my skin tone.

14:04.280 --> 14:06.800
You'd love me
at a three alarm fire.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.400
I already do.

14:08.400 --> 14:09.840
                               What?

14:09.840 --> 14:13.840
You know. Love you.

14:15.080 --> 14:16.680
                           Let's go.

14:16.680 --> 14:18.080
Where?

14:18.080 --> 14:20.160
                     I know a place.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.680
Then again,
so did the 2 o'clock.

14:22.680 --> 14:24.480
(LAUGHS)

14:24.480 --> 14:27.360
You still taking antibiotics?

14:27.360 --> 14:29.120
You still taking antibiotics?
No, never took to 'em.

14:29.120 --> 14:31.320
Wow! I never would have guessed.

14:31.320 --> 14:33.680
Dr Mott suggested it.

14:33.680 --> 14:35.240
You don't act depressed.

14:35.240 --> 14:37.200
You don't act depressed.
I've been feeling low lately.

14:37.200 --> 14:40.160
With all you've been through,
the resident review committee

14:40.160 --> 14:43.280
ready to shut down plastics, the
sleazy girls you've been seeing.

14:43.280 --> 14:47.240
The sexual harassment problem
with Lucy Papandrao,

14:47.240 --> 14:51.240
and the scars,
no wonder you're suicidal.

14:53.840 --> 14:57.680
SCREAM,
FOLLOWED BY GLASS BREAKING

14:57.680 --> 14:59.080
     Oh, no, he's still here.

14:59.080 --> 15:00.840
What's the matter?

15:00.840 --> 15:04.000
This guy asked for
spaghetti and meat sauce.
I tell him it's cold,

15:04.000 --> 15:05.840
he says I don't care, so
I give him it, he goes bananas!

15:05.840 --> 15:08.400
he says I don't care, so
I give him it, he goes bananas!
It has garlic in it,
I can't eat garlic!

15:08.400 --> 15:10.080
All spaghetti sauce
has garlic in it.

15:10.080 --> 15:12.040
All spaghetti sauce
has garlic in it.
But vampires
can't stand the stuff.

15:12.040 --> 15:15.880
Help me, Dr Axelrod,
please, I beg you.

15:15.880 --> 15:19.440
I'm slowly losing the power
of reason, I can't help myself!

15:19.440 --> 15:21.120
             Stop me!

15:21.120 --> 15:25.120
Stop me before I need to suck blood
from some poor unsuspecting damsel.

15:25.840 --> 15:29.000
Get this guy up to psyche, and
admit him, he's your patient.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.880
Can't we just dump him on the streets
or give him spaghetti with no sauce?

15:31.880 --> 15:34.520
Can't we just dump him on the streets
or give him spaghetti with no sauce?
Obviously, he needs some help.

15:34.520 --> 15:38.520
Take it easy. Dr Axelrod's
gonna take very good care of you.

15:44.200 --> 15:48.200
Why me? Why is it always me?

15:49.800 --> 15:52.800
How am I supposed to get the food
upstairs with no elevator?

15:52.800 --> 15:56.360
I've had maintenance cut
the power while Mott's
performing surgery,

15:56.360 --> 15:57.960
we must drain as little as possible.

15:57.960 --> 15:58.960
we must drain as little as possible.
 How long will the operation take?

15:58.960 --> 16:00.200
we must drain as little as possible.
 How long will the operation take?
I've no way of knowing.

16:00.200 --> 16:03.200
What do I say to a room full of
patients waiting for their dinners?

16:03.200 --> 16:06.280
Like everyone else, they'll have
to be more flexible tonight.

16:06.280 --> 16:06.600
Excuse me.

16:06.600 --> 16:07.880
Excuse me.
Yes, Luther.

16:07.880 --> 16:10.000
I think I have a solution
to the problem.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
Meet me on the third floor.

16:14.480 --> 16:17.920
Ooh! Never been down
here before. Have you?

16:17.920 --> 16:19.160
Many times.

16:19.160 --> 16:22.320
           I mean, with other women?

16:22.320 --> 16:25.880
           I mean, with other women?
Oh, oh, oh, Mona.

16:25.880 --> 16:29.880
                    Yes or no?

16:30.400 --> 16:31.600
Hi.

16:31.600 --> 16:32.720
Hi.

16:32.720 --> 16:34.680
I was talking to her.

16:34.680 --> 16:38.680
Hello.

16:38.800 --> 16:41.800
Carl, I can't you leave you
alone for five minutes.

16:41.800 --> 16:45.800
FOOTSTEPS

16:46.720 --> 16:48.280
Where are we going, anyway?

16:48.280 --> 16:49.480
Where are we going, anyway?
Right here.

16:49.480 --> 16:50.880
     (BANGS AGAINST A DOOR)

16:50.880 --> 16:51.920
Are you OK?

16:51.920 --> 16:55.920
I'm fine.

16:57.200 --> 17:00.440
I'd carry you over the threshold
but you'd burn your butt.

17:00.440 --> 17:02.440
           Oh!  Careful!

17:02.440 --> 17:06.440
             (GIGGLES)

17:09.359 --> 17:10.920
Mona...

17:10.920 --> 17:13.960
             Kiss me.

17:13.960 --> 17:16.680
      Oooh, that was my ear.

17:16.680 --> 17:18.520
Kyle!

17:18.520 --> 17:22.520
I don't smell anything
smoking in here.

17:23.640 --> 17:27.640
Hold that light higher, for crying
out loud. I can't see what I'm doing.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.360
If you don't have
the stamina, step out,

17:30.360 --> 17:32.040
 let someone else take your place.

17:32.040 --> 17:34.000
I have located both vagus nerves.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.280
     Make sure you check for a third.

17:37.280 --> 17:41.280
So, Dr Wade, your in-laws have
invaded the happy homestead, hmm?

17:41.760 --> 17:42.880
Yes, sir.

17:42.880 --> 17:45.880
You should be grateful,
I saved you from a hideous meal.

17:45.880 --> 17:49.560
Actually, I get along with my
husband's family better than my own.

17:49.560 --> 17:52.280
Besides,
Albert was poaching trout

17:52.280 --> 17:56.040
with champagne tarragon sauce,
the best.

17:56.040 --> 18:00.040
Hold on there, buster.
Dr Wade, check the temperature.

18:01.560 --> 18:03.000
37.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.320
                 All right, go ahead.

18:05.320 --> 18:08.240
    So Robert's a gourmet cook, huh?

18:08.240 --> 18:12.240
I'm not so bad in the kitchen
myself, my Coquille St Jacques,
Provencal, for example.

18:14.040 --> 18:18.040
Blood's not moving fast enough,
better squeeze the life out of it.

18:19.560 --> 18:23.560
I saute-slice scallops
just until they turn opaque.

18:25.400 --> 18:29.400
And then I mix in finely
minced onion and garlic,

18:30.120 --> 18:32.680
                    toss in tomatoes,

18:32.680 --> 18:34.880
                     parsley, thyme.

18:34.880 --> 18:38.600
              A little dry Vermouth.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.160
            I've got a bleeder here.

18:40.160 --> 18:41.680
Cautery.

18:41.680 --> 18:45.520
Wake up, Wade, we can't use
the cautery, remember.

18:45.520 --> 18:46.080
Yes, sir.

18:46.080 --> 18:48.480
Yes, sir.
Am I the only one
paying attention here?

18:48.480 --> 18:52.360
I'll tie by hand - snaps...

18:52.360 --> 18:56.160
That's why this operation is gonna
take three times longer than usual.

18:56.160 --> 18:59.480
One more snafoo, Wade, and you'll
be home in time for dessert.

18:59.480 --> 19:01.280
Orange caramel trifle.

19:01.280 --> 19:05.280
                       Mono-polydeck.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.200
           When was your last period?

19:10.200 --> 19:11.600
What are we talking about?

19:11.600 --> 19:15.600
I examined your daughter, Mrs Dowler,
she's gained 3lb, she's nauseated,

19:15.760 --> 19:19.600
her breasts are tender,
her uterus is slightly enlarged,

19:19.600 --> 19:21.920
I called in Dr Ehrlich for an OBGY
and consult.

19:21.920 --> 19:22.960
Why?

19:22.960 --> 19:26.400
I think maybe your daughter is, erm,
with child. That smells good.

19:26.400 --> 19:27.160
Oh, wonderful(!)

19:27.160 --> 19:28.320
Oh, wonderful(!)
      We don't know for sure

19:28.320 --> 19:31.440
and we won't know until
after the blood tests are finished.

19:31.440 --> 19:33.800
       Very clever, Luther.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.080
All in a day's work.

19:35.080 --> 19:36.560
By the way, where's Donald?

19:36.560 --> 19:40.560
           I've no idea.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.680
Howdy. Mrs Valere, you back from
having the crit already?

19:44.680 --> 19:46.880
I haven't gone yet.

19:46.880 --> 19:47.920
Luther!

19:47.920 --> 19:51.920
Luther, I need you to get a patient,
Mrs Valere, right in here,

19:52.280 --> 19:54.720
 down to Dr Wasiac in haematology.

19:54.720 --> 19:56.000
I'm on my way.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.040
Helen, could I eat one of those,
I haven't had din-dins.

19:59.040 --> 20:00.280
Forget it!

20:00.280 --> 20:03.600
Mr Handsley, get back to the ward,
food will be here in a minute,

20:03.600 --> 20:07.600
and you know that there is no
smoking except in designated areas.

20:09.520 --> 20:11.840
All righty. Supper's here.

20:11.840 --> 20:14.000
I'm really not very hungry.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.840
  I am.  Dr Chandler turn up yet?

20:16.840 --> 20:19.960
Nope. Just cool your heals,
Mr Valere, they do the same thing

20:19.960 --> 20:22.840
in haematology you do on
the floor of the stock market.

20:22.840 --> 20:26.840
I'll be here, honey.

20:28.040 --> 20:29.720
  What do you think?  About what?

20:29.720 --> 20:33.720
I wasn't supposed to be back in
this hospital until the baby was
born. Something's wrong.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.840
You don't know that for sure.

20:36.840 --> 20:40.840
I was adopted, you know, surrounded
by people who didn't look like me.

20:41.760 --> 20:44.720
Don't get me wrong,
I was loved all right.

20:44.720 --> 20:47.240
 I want this child to be from me,

20:47.240 --> 20:51.240
I've gone through this artificial
insemination merely to perpetuate
myself.

20:51.520 --> 20:53.600
           Is that ego?

20:53.600 --> 20:54.720
Yeah.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.240
              Thanks!

20:56.240 --> 20:59.600
Mrs Valere, I'm alone in the world,
no family, no money,

20:59.600 --> 21:03.200
not much of a job, and I see you and
I say, "Look at all she's got,

21:03.200 --> 21:07.080
"She should be happy, no-one's got
it all." You see what I'm saying?

21:07.080 --> 21:11.080
And not moaning about it
is what makes us heroes.

21:18.480 --> 21:22.200
              I'm OK.

21:22.200 --> 21:26.200
Oh, they must go out of their way to
make these chairs so uncomfortable.

21:26.440 --> 21:27.560
Oh, boy.

21:27.560 --> 21:28.800
Oh!

21:28.800 --> 21:32.800
He'll never be a hero.

21:39.240 --> 21:40.640
            Dr Wasiac?

21:40.640 --> 21:42.120
I'm really sorry.

21:42.120 --> 21:44.720
I'm not looking forward
to being poked with needles.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.200
I have to draw blood.

21:46.200 --> 21:47.400
          OK, which arm?

21:47.400 --> 21:48.400
Neither, from your neck.

21:48.400 --> 21:52.400
Neither, from your neck.
            (SCREAMING)

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
   You ever been in prison, man?

22:05.440 --> 22:07.200
No.

22:07.200 --> 22:11.200
Most time I've ever done
is in traffic school.

22:11.840 --> 22:15.840
Three solid days in jail.

22:15.840 --> 22:19.840
Amarillo. The Texas panhandle.

22:20.880 --> 22:23.840
It was a drug bust.

22:23.840 --> 22:27.160
You know you were talking earlier
about not having any control?

22:27.160 --> 22:30.240
You ever had your hands cuffed
behind your back?

22:30.240 --> 22:31.280
No.

22:31.280 --> 22:35.160
Ever been thrown into a rat-infested
stinking hole for 72 hours?

22:35.160 --> 22:39.160
The jail door slams shut and
you think, "Totally at their mercy,

22:40.080 --> 22:41.840
    "they'll forget about me."

22:41.840 --> 22:45.840
All of a sudden, nothing matters
but getting out of there.

22:47.440 --> 22:48.760
Being free.

22:48.760 --> 22:49.960
Yeah, being free.

22:49.960 --> 22:53.960
Took my girlfriend three
days to raise the bail.

22:54.360 --> 22:57.840
I got to thinking, I was thinking
to myself, "Now, wait a minute.

22:57.840 --> 23:01.840
"Maybe she doesn't want
me to get out of here."

23:02.760 --> 23:06.760
You get paranoid, you've only
got four walls to bounce around.

23:08.880 --> 23:12.880
So how does it feel to be caged up
with a full-fledged felon?

23:12.880 --> 23:14.160
Come on, take it easy.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.840
            Let us out!

23:15.840 --> 23:18.880
Listen, when the workers show up
again,

23:18.880 --> 23:22.880
we'll have them check on your
girlfriend's status, all right?

23:23.480 --> 23:24.720
Yeah, all right, yeah.

23:24.720 --> 23:28.720
                OK.

23:31.320 --> 23:34.080
         I tell you, man,

23:34.080 --> 23:38.080
I learnt a very important
thing from my arrest.

23:38.080 --> 23:41.240
      If you want to toke...

23:41.240 --> 23:45.040
 do it where you won't get caught.

23:45.040 --> 23:49.040
Want to get on it?

23:49.680 --> 23:51.920
He said, "I'm gonna bite your neck."

23:51.920 --> 23:55.080
So I flipped the guy over and
he started crying like a baby,

23:55.080 --> 23:57.040
           a baby wolf.

23:57.040 --> 24:00.400
I tell you, I don't think Tim
is crazy, stress-ridden,

24:00.400 --> 24:02.600
anxious, yes, but not certifiable.

24:02.600 --> 24:05.120
Dr Mott, do me a favour,
take him off my back.

24:05.120 --> 24:06.160
No.

24:06.160 --> 24:08.720
I want to die,
right here, right now.

24:08.720 --> 24:11.800
Have Dr Weiss come in,
he's a psychiatrist.

24:11.800 --> 24:15.120
I'm a psychologist,
we're just as good.

24:15.120 --> 24:18.360
I'll tell you what I will do, when
you get the blood test results,

24:18.360 --> 24:21.160
bring 'em to my office and
we'll try to figure this out.

24:21.160 --> 24:24.040
It's obvious,
the guy's a dime short!

24:24.040 --> 24:27.320
So long, Tim.

24:27.320 --> 24:29.000
            I'm sorry.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.120
Right.

24:30.120 --> 24:32.520
Back to the ward!

24:32.520 --> 24:36.360
No, please, any place else,
somewhere with room to breathe.

24:36.360 --> 24:40.360
I thought vampires enjoyed
closed spaces - like caskets!

24:40.600 --> 24:44.480
I don't understand how you got
from Washington Heights to Tulane.

24:44.480 --> 24:45.560
Delta Airlines.

24:45.560 --> 24:48.320
                             Come on.

24:48.320 --> 24:51.000
I want to get to know the real you.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.120
I think it'll make us better
together.

24:54.120 --> 24:56.680
Tulane is the Harvard of the South.

24:56.680 --> 24:57.720
                               It is?

24:57.720 --> 25:00.400
And the Harvard of the North
laughed at my application.

25:00.400 --> 25:02.840
Ooh. Just shift your
weight to the other elbow.

25:02.840 --> 25:04.120
Sure.

25:04.120 --> 25:08.120
I like that.

25:09.800 --> 25:13.400
Did you have many women at Tulane?

25:13.400 --> 25:15.720
By gender, yes, did you?

25:15.720 --> 25:17.640
Is there a lot of men in your past?

25:17.640 --> 25:20.680
I went to a Catholic nursing school.

25:20.680 --> 25:22.200
Pretty restricting, right?

25:22.200 --> 25:24.200
        Oh, yeah. But, er,

25:24.200 --> 25:27.200
I did make love with a
guy who's now as bishop.

25:27.200 --> 25:29.160
He couldn't get none?

25:29.160 --> 25:33.160
            (CHUCKLES)

25:38.360 --> 25:41.360
Mrs Dowler,
can I see you for a minute?

25:41.360 --> 25:42.440
                                  Hi.

25:42.440 --> 25:46.440
Hi.

25:50.720 --> 25:52.480
                             The, er,

25:52.480 --> 25:55.360
the results are positive,
she's definitely pregnant.

25:55.360 --> 25:59.360
I want to make arrangements
for an abortion.

25:59.520 --> 26:01.520
          Look, I know this is, er...

26:01.520 --> 26:03.440
  You know there's no rush to decide.

26:03.440 --> 26:07.120
I've had the last few hours to
think, I don't need any more time.

26:07.120 --> 26:09.000
    Have you talked it over with Pru?

26:09.000 --> 26:11.680
My daughter has the mind of
a seven-year-old,

26:11.680 --> 26:13.840
she barely knows
how to tie her shoes.

26:13.840 --> 26:16.280
I'm not letting a bad mistake
get worse.

26:16.280 --> 26:18.120
   There are plenty of other options.

26:18.120 --> 26:19.320
Yeah? Like what?

26:19.320 --> 26:21.480
Well, you could
always keep the baby,

26:21.480 --> 26:25.440
or you could put it up for adoption,
abortion can't be the best choice.

26:25.440 --> 26:28.160
Pru was with a busload
of disabled people

26:28.160 --> 26:31.040
that got hit by a drunk driver,
not my choice.

26:31.040 --> 26:33.960
She was brought here, not my choice.

26:33.960 --> 26:36.960
She and a retarded boy made love.

26:36.960 --> 26:39.960
Now you've got some nerve
telling me I can't step in now,

26:39.960 --> 26:43.960
this is my child who's pregnant,
and your hospital is responsible.

26:44.600 --> 26:48.600
 Dr Wade, take a look at the polaris.

26:50.120 --> 26:51.520
There's too much scarring.

26:51.520 --> 26:53.960
Are we going to remove
a portion of the stomach?

26:53.960 --> 26:56.360
You've got it.
Ladies and gentlemen,

26:56.360 --> 27:00.360
a serious situation has just kicked
into overdrive. Orange Juice,
suture that tissue.

27:00.600 --> 27:04.600
Snaps.

27:07.200 --> 27:09.040
              Keep bagging it, Henry,

27:09.040 --> 27:12.640
I want everybody to stay
exactly where they are.

27:12.640 --> 27:15.320
Find someone, get me a progress
report on the blackout.

27:15.320 --> 27:18.880
Now, I'm not prepared to switch
horses here and start revving up

27:18.880 --> 27:22.400
the machines until I'm positive
the lights won't go off again.

27:22.400 --> 27:26.040
As long as this woman's life is in
danger, no-one relaxes, understand?

27:26.040 --> 27:29.480
       Now just keep those lights up.

27:29.480 --> 27:30.760
                    Let's continue...

27:30.760 --> 27:32.240
                       You know Bela?

27:32.240 --> 27:33.280
Who?

27:33.280 --> 27:34.640
                              Lugosi?

27:34.640 --> 27:37.120
        You're a vampire, aren't you?

27:37.120 --> 27:39.880
Yeah, that's what people tell me.

27:39.880 --> 27:43.000
Ever since I was a little boy,
I couldn't go out in the sunlight

27:43.000 --> 27:45.880
without feeling sick. Do you have
any idea what it's like

27:45.880 --> 27:47.760
to be pasty-looking your whole life?

27:47.760 --> 27:49.760
No, not exactly.

27:49.760 --> 27:52.680
I couldn't wait
for daylight saving time to end

27:52.680 --> 27:55.080
so that I could go out earlier
for walks.

27:55.080 --> 27:59.080
All the kids in the block
would yell, "Fang Face!"

28:00.560 --> 28:04.280
My...my father had the same problem,
and ever since he died,

28:04.280 --> 28:05.400
I have no friends.

28:05.400 --> 28:07.200
  So you're not really a vampire?

28:07.200 --> 28:11.200
No, I'm not.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.640
I'm a werewolf.

28:15.640 --> 28:19.320
(HOWLING)

28:19.320 --> 28:23.320
(HOWLING CONTINUES)

28:28.320 --> 28:30.440
Your wife's pregnancy tests are back.

28:30.440 --> 28:34.440
I'm afraid the news isn't very good,
Mrs Valere did have a miscarriage.

28:34.440 --> 28:38.440
I've scheduled a D and C for
tomorrow, assuming the lights are on.

28:38.440 --> 28:39.920
How am I gonna tell her?

28:39.920 --> 28:41.520
    If you'd like, I will.  No.

28:41.520 --> 28:44.120
At times like this,
my aunt used to say...

28:44.120 --> 28:45.880
The George Glass Company.

28:45.880 --> 28:49.040
Hi. George, the George Glass. No.

28:49.040 --> 28:52.080
Durchin Sewing Centre.

28:52.080 --> 28:55.280
Hi, Frank Durchin here,
Durchin Sewing Centre. No.

28:55.280 --> 28:57.920
Hello, John,
still can't remember your real name?

28:57.920 --> 29:00.400
No. I thought letting
my fingers do the walking

29:00.400 --> 29:03.400
might trigger what I did for a
living. If I can remember that

29:03.400 --> 29:07.400
maybe I can figure out my identity,
and stop being another John Doe.

29:08.960 --> 29:12.320
Mmm. Calisto Instruments.

29:12.320 --> 29:16.320
Hi, Donato Calisto here. Huh? Nah.

29:16.400 --> 29:19.520
I'm sure the authorities are
doing everything they can.

29:19.520 --> 29:20.840
What authorities?

29:20.840 --> 29:23.160
The police, the FBI.

29:23.160 --> 29:26.760
Ooh, FBI. I like those letters,
what can they do?

29:26.760 --> 29:30.000
Identify missing persons,

29:30.000 --> 29:33.560
maybe there's a record of you at
the IRS, the DMV, TRW...

29:33.560 --> 29:36.680
Wait a minute,
let me write this down.

29:36.680 --> 29:40.680
The, er IRA, DMZ, FYI...

29:42.120 --> 29:43.160
FBI.

29:43.160 --> 29:44.440
Oh, F...

29:44.440 --> 29:45.480
B...

29:45.480 --> 29:46.920
B...  I...

29:46.920 --> 29:48.320
I...am  exhausted!

29:48.320 --> 29:51.520
Louis, I know. What did that
doctor say to your mother?

29:51.520 --> 29:55.520
I'll try to reach the doctor myself.
OK?

29:55.680 --> 29:56.560
Any candles?

29:56.560 --> 29:58.160
Have you seen Mr Hansley?

29:58.160 --> 30:00.080
I just left him in the solarium.

30:00.080 --> 30:04.080
Oh, go get him, he's been wandering
around the halls smoking cigarettes.
It's time he should be sleeping.

30:05.200 --> 30:07.040
We should all be asleep.

30:07.040 --> 30:11.040
Louis, we got a blackout here in
Boston. I don't think
I can get out of Logan.

30:11.480 --> 30:15.480
Look, pal, she'll be fine,
she is as strong as a horse.

30:16.280 --> 30:19.840
It'll be all right.
Just keep me posted, will you?

30:19.840 --> 30:21.880
And give her my love.

30:21.880 --> 30:23.480
Night.

30:23.480 --> 30:25.160
Who's that?

30:25.160 --> 30:29.160
Louisa Mountear, mother of one of
my best friends from college.

30:29.320 --> 30:33.320
in the summer we'd go up to her farm,
milk cows, shuck corn, farm girls.

30:34.160 --> 30:37.200
80 something, like 80 years old,
fine old money gentility.

30:37.200 --> 30:39.720
She's important to you?

30:39.720 --> 30:42.880
There was a time when I didn't
get on with my folks too well.

30:42.880 --> 30:46.760
They were on me to buckle down,
study, fulfil my grand potential

30:46.760 --> 30:48.960
              or some crud like that.

30:48.960 --> 30:52.960
And they really beat me down.
I'd go up to the farm.

30:53.480 --> 30:56.240
She's closer to me
than my own mother.

30:56.240 --> 31:00.240
Now, if I could get to a Baltimore,
I could make the difference.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.960
  I could deal with her doctors.

31:02.960 --> 31:05.400
I'm looking for a Helen Rosenthal?

31:05.400 --> 31:06.680
You've found her.

31:06.680 --> 31:08.240
Officer Mike Stone.

31:08.240 --> 31:11.200
You're working awfully late,
aren't you?

31:11.200 --> 31:13.360
Oh, the blackout, put us behind.

31:13.360 --> 31:17.000
Now I've been authorised
by the Boston Municipal Court

31:17.000 --> 31:20.040
to serve you with this complaint.

31:20.040 --> 31:23.200
You are hereby ordered to appear
before the court

31:23.200 --> 31:27.200
on the date named within.

31:27.240 --> 31:30.560
She's really done it.

31:30.560 --> 31:34.560
Catherine Rea is taking me to
court for assault and battery.

31:40.640 --> 31:44.640
Mr Handsley, Time For beddy-byes,
let me get you a chair.

31:51.000 --> 31:55.000
           Mr Handsley.

31:57.800 --> 32:01.800
    Code blue in the solarium.

32:04.680 --> 32:08.360
# Crashed out of the market
Out of the door

32:08.360 --> 32:10.240
# Put on a corner show

32:10.240 --> 32:14.240
# Blown out of the picture
back against the wall. #

32:15.640 --> 32:18.200
Hmm. Pretty bleak view
of the world, isn't it?

32:18.200 --> 32:20.880
It's a pretty bleak world to view.

32:20.880 --> 32:22.400
No, I don't agree.

32:22.400 --> 32:24.080
(SCOFFS)

32:24.080 --> 32:28.080
Oh, man. You are a piece of work.

32:28.320 --> 32:31.800
What's so great about life, anyway?

32:31.800 --> 32:33.440
People get cancer?

32:33.440 --> 32:37.440
They get tumours of the brain,
their hearts explode.

32:37.800 --> 32:40.560
That's death. Not life.

32:40.560 --> 32:44.280
Oh, fine.
Jazzing through the Eighties.

32:44.280 --> 32:47.160
Christians kill Muslims,
and Muslims kill Israelis

32:47.160 --> 32:49.600
and Israelis kill Palestinian
terrorists -

32:49.600 --> 32:52.880
who kill
anybody they can get their hands on.

32:52.880 --> 32:55.280
You're still talking about death.

32:55.280 --> 32:57.480
Oh.

32:57.480 --> 33:00.840
I'm talking about
the human disease -

33:00.840 --> 33:02.720
knives in the alley...

33:02.720 --> 33:06.040
rip-offs, rape.

33:06.040 --> 33:10.040
Above it all
hangs total destruction.

33:11.320 --> 33:14.200
Hand-crafted by man, of course.

33:14.200 --> 33:16.400
Is this where marijuana gets you?

33:16.400 --> 33:20.400
Oh, I get high, so what? Makes
the filth, easier to live with.

33:23.040 --> 33:26.600
I have a daughter in college.

33:26.600 --> 33:29.280
You all think you're going
to live forever, don't you?

33:29.280 --> 33:32.240
Let me tell you something,
my friend,

33:32.240 --> 33:36.080
when you've been around longer,
you'll realise how precious
every day is.

33:36.080 --> 33:38.960
I've had it with you, man!

33:38.960 --> 33:42.240
I've had it! Five twisted hours
with Pollyanna.

33:42.240 --> 33:44.600
That's it.
I'm out of here. So long.

33:44.600 --> 33:46.840
You idiot,
you're not going anywhere!

33:46.840 --> 33:50.840
You keep the light, pal,
I'm a creature of the dark.

33:57.560 --> 33:58.600
Argh!

33:58.600 --> 34:00.040
Oh...!

34:00.040 --> 34:04.040
(GROANING)

34:11.239 --> 34:13.120
He's been down two minutes.  Bag him.

34:13.120 --> 34:14.159
Not now.

34:14.159 --> 34:16.360
OK. I'll take over.

34:16.360 --> 34:18.360
      I know what I'm doing.

34:18.360 --> 34:20.800
Luther, this is no time
to debate the adequacy

34:20.800 --> 34:23.840
of your paramedic training.
I'm running this code, move.

34:23.840 --> 34:27.840
Put him on a monitor.

34:29.120 --> 34:31.840
Mrs Dowler doesn't have
the right to choose for Pru.

34:31.840 --> 34:35.840
According to the Supreme Court
she does, do you want to take on
Chief Justice Berger?

34:36.199 --> 34:39.360
There's no guarantee that
Pru's child would be retarded.

34:39.360 --> 34:43.360
You ought to be careful what
you eat. Put whatever you had
for dinner, off your diet.

34:43.679 --> 34:46.440
And even if it was, the child
still has a right to live.

34:46.440 --> 34:50.440
Yeah. I've got to go see Mrs Foyle.

34:53.480 --> 34:55.560
I want you to help me talk
to Mrs Dowler.

34:55.560 --> 34:56.960
No way, pal.  Why not?

34:56.960 --> 35:00.600
I'm new to the wonderful world
of obstetrics.

35:00.600 --> 35:04.600
What I see in a pregnancy - nausea,
insomnia, bloating,

35:04.960 --> 35:08.960
post partum hair loss,
varicose veins, haemorrhoids,

35:09.240 --> 35:12.920
indigestion, not to mention pounds
and pounds of ugly unwanted fat -

35:12.920 --> 35:15.640
I wouldn't ask my own
mother to go through it again.

35:15.640 --> 35:18.600
That is, if she were still live,
and I were still unborn.

35:18.600 --> 35:21.680
I see.  Abort life to avoid
the inconvenience?

35:21.680 --> 35:25.680
Ever since Clancy did the deed,
you've been in a lather. You know,
you're a doctor, not a judge.

35:26.080 --> 35:28.560
&lt; Richard, do you know a good
lawyer? I need one.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.560
She could put
the baby up for adoption.

35:30.560 --> 35:32.000
Pru still has to give birth.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.520
For a woman who understands it's
one thing, but a retarded girl?

35:35.520 --> 35:37.800
You want to explain to her
why she's in pain?

35:37.800 --> 35:40.520
Yes.  Well, good luck.

35:40.520 --> 35:44.080
Kind of ironic, isn't it.
Terri wants a kid, can't.

35:44.080 --> 35:45.360
Pru has one and won't.

35:45.360 --> 35:48.400
I've just had a brouhaha
with the City Engineer.

35:48.400 --> 35:49.720
City Engineer, huh?

35:49.720 --> 35:53.320
I told in this was an unconscionable
situation and that I intend to make

35:53.320 --> 35:56.120
a public outcry in order to
get our equipment up to date.

35:56.120 --> 35:58.760
And why are you here?
I told you not to leave your post.

35:58.760 --> 36:00.880
That's what I came to you,
to tell you...

36:00.880 --> 36:01.920
PHONE RINGING

36:01.920 --> 36:03.920
Third floor.

36:03.920 --> 36:04.960
What?

36:04.960 --> 36:08.240
No, the phones are working.

36:08.240 --> 36:10.960
What?  No, no, you have a nice day(!)

36:10.960 --> 36:14.960
Do you know, if I lose to Lucy,
I have to pay all medical bills,

36:16.320 --> 36:20.320
punitive damages for emotional
distress, ¤15,000 of distress?!

36:22.440 --> 36:25.920
For that much, I should have knocked
out teeth. Where are you going?

36:25.920 --> 36:29.120
Baltimore. See Mrs Mountear. If I
speed, I'll be there by morning.

36:29.120 --> 36:32.040
You can't. The roads are too icy.
The snow is still falling.

36:32.040 --> 36:34.080
Helen, she was always there for me.

36:34.080 --> 36:38.080
I've got to be there for her.

36:39.080 --> 36:43.080
  Could I use that phone, please?

36:43.400 --> 36:47.400
            Thank you.

36:52.760 --> 36:55.720
Hello, FBI? J Edgar Hoover, please.

36:55.720 --> 36:59.560
Oh, he's not, well,
can I leave him a message?

36:59.560 --> 37:01.680
          Who's calling?

37:01.680 --> 37:05.680
Well, I'm at
St Eligius Hospital in Boston.

37:06.200 --> 37:10.200
My name?
That's the problem, I don't know.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.040
How do they expect
to stay in business,

37:13.040 --> 37:17.040
if they treat their customers
like this?

37:17.920 --> 37:19.080
       You'll be all right.

37:19.080 --> 37:22.080
Hurts like hell, man.

37:22.080 --> 37:24.000
     At least you can feel it.

37:24.000 --> 37:28.000
You think I'm too high?

37:31.160 --> 37:33.960
 Look, I'm sorry if I sounded old.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.960
 It's just that I'm selfish enough

37:35.960 --> 37:38.720
to believe that my being alive
has some meaning.

37:38.720 --> 37:42.720
That we, all of us, are important.

37:44.800 --> 37:48.800
Hope doesn't come from what
life is or what it could be...

37:48.920 --> 37:52.920
     but what it ought to be.

37:53.160 --> 37:55.400
Do you know any songs, man?

37:55.400 --> 37:59.400
            (CHUCKLES)

38:06.480 --> 38:07.520
                           Elliott, &gt;

38:07.520 --> 38:10.400
      I've got it, porphyria.

38:10.400 --> 38:11.720
How nice for you(!)

38:11.720 --> 38:15.440
No, I took the liberty of checking
Mr Fitzsimmons's blood profile.

38:15.440 --> 38:19.400
My guess, he's suffering from a rare
genetic disease called porphyria.

38:19.400 --> 38:20.680
I've never heard of it.

38:20.680 --> 38:24.680
It's a malfunction of the
body's ability to manufacture
a blood product called haem.

38:24.960 --> 38:27.680
The patient is extraordinarily
sensitive to sunlight

38:27.680 --> 38:31.680
because it disfigures the skin
and garlic exacerbates the symptoms.

38:32.320 --> 38:35.840
But we can treat it with dietary
therapy. Now, according to this,

38:35.840 --> 38:38.880
people of the Middle Ages
who were considered vampires,

38:38.880 --> 38:41.040
were really suffering from porphyria.

38:41.040 --> 38:43.480
                                Here.

38:43.480 --> 38:47.480
                     Return the book!

38:48.680 --> 38:50.960
Six floors to the morgue.

38:50.960 --> 38:54.960
At least it's all downhill.

38:56.200 --> 38:57.240
&lt; Argh!

38:57.240 --> 39:01.240
(THUDDING)

39:02.120 --> 39:04.000
That's one way of getting there!

39:04.000 --> 39:05.840
I'm dreaming.

39:05.840 --> 39:08.640
It's the greatest night of my life.

39:08.640 --> 39:10.520
I bet you say that to all the girls.

39:10.520 --> 39:12.720
I mean it, this time.

39:12.720 --> 39:15.840
Really?

39:15.840 --> 39:19.080
You're so beautiful.

39:19.080 --> 39:22.040
No, don't turn away.

39:22.040 --> 39:26.040
I want to look at you.

39:27.960 --> 39:30.240
I wish we could lie
like this forever.

39:30.240 --> 39:32.720
Yes. Who needs food.

39:32.720 --> 39:36.080
If music be the food of love,
play on.

39:36.080 --> 39:39.840
(CHUCKLING) Oh, Wayne.
Oh, that's so...

39:39.840 --> 39:42.080
I know, I know. It's inappropriate.

39:42.080 --> 39:45.680
But that's the great thing about
love, you can say stupid things like,

39:45.680 --> 39:47.960
"I've never felt like this before."

39:47.960 --> 39:51.960
That's because you're feeling me.

39:53.600 --> 39:57.600
I love you.

39:58.800 --> 40:02.800
I dreamt you'd say that to me.

40:03.360 --> 40:04.720
I really love you.

40:04.720 --> 40:06.880
I love you, too.

40:06.880 --> 40:09.280
Would you marry me?

40:09.280 --> 40:13.280
Sure.

40:16.480 --> 40:20.280
               Cut.

40:20.280 --> 40:24.280
  Blood pressure holding steady?

40:25.400 --> 40:27.160
    We controlled the bleeding.

40:27.160 --> 40:31.160
Looks like she's going to make it.

40:39.360 --> 40:43.360
        Get her to post-op.

40:47.320 --> 40:48.440
Dr Craig?

40:48.440 --> 40:49.600
               Yeah?

40:49.600 --> 40:53.600
Sir, this may seem presumptuous
of me, but, well, I really...

40:55.240 --> 40:56.840
           Spit it out.

40:56.840 --> 41:00.000
The team worked very hard
in there, all night long.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.720
Don't you think that...?

41:01.720 --> 41:03.880
I mean being a hard-ass is one
thing,

41:03.880 --> 41:06.280
but they deserve
some kind of thanks.

41:06.280 --> 41:08.800
       For doing their job?

41:08.800 --> 41:12.520
Anyone in that room is there because
they're the best. By selecting them,

41:12.520 --> 41:16.520
I gave them my appreciation. They
work hard because they're supposed
to, because they want to save people.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.880
        You catch my drift?

41:19.880 --> 41:21.680
Yes, Sir.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.640
             Dr Wade?

41:23.640 --> 41:24.680
Sir?

41:24.680 --> 41:28.640
I'll bet you thought I
was going to say "good job"?

41:28.640 --> 41:32.640
Stay with them
until she is safely upstairs.

41:37.960 --> 41:39.640
      So, I'm not a monster?

41:39.640 --> 41:41.440
No. You have porphyria.

41:41.440 --> 41:42.600
        How nice for me(!)

41:42.600 --> 41:46.600
Look, Tim, I owe you an apology.
Porphyria is a very rare disease.

41:47.600 --> 41:50.960
Worse than suffering from
the illness of that disease,

41:50.960 --> 41:53.920
is a lack of sensitivity
from the outside world.

41:53.920 --> 41:55.640
But your case is even rarer.

41:55.640 --> 41:58.760
People made you think you were
a spook, so you acted like one.

41:58.760 --> 42:00.440
I mean, this isn't the Dark Ages.

42:00.440 --> 42:03.160
 I know, it only looks like that.

42:03.160 --> 42:05.480
You seem disappointed.

42:05.480 --> 42:08.840
No, no, not really. It's just that
after all these years

42:08.840 --> 42:11.880
as a misfit of science,
it's going to be kind of hard

42:11.880 --> 42:15.880
  to live as a manimal, like you.

42:16.280 --> 42:18.400
Excuse me, are you a doctor?

42:18.400 --> 42:20.680
Yes. What's the problem?

42:20.680 --> 42:22.000
I sprained my back.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.200
How did that happen?

42:23.200 --> 42:27.120
I was winging my way from Jupiter
to Mars, and the tele-transporter

42:27.120 --> 42:29.720
ran into a shower of meteors.

42:29.720 --> 42:32.160
I didn't have my seatbelt fastened.

42:32.160 --> 42:36.160
Why me?! Why is it always me?!

42:40.240 --> 42:41.960
Night, Dr Ehrlich.  Toodles, Luther.

42:41.960 --> 42:44.680
Oh, Dr Ehrlich
Listen, can I ask you a question?

42:44.680 --> 42:45.720
Sure.

42:45.720 --> 42:49.400
Do you think I have the potential to
move upward in the medical community?

42:49.400 --> 42:52.200
If you are talking about riding
shotgun in an ambulance, sure,

42:52.200 --> 42:55.400
but I wouldn't get my hopes up for
Surgeon-General. What's this about?

42:55.400 --> 42:59.400
I don't know. It seems to me like
I know how this hospital works much
better than most anybody.

43:00.160 --> 43:04.160
But it's holding me back.
I want to help people, not
just clean up after their puke.

43:04.440 --> 43:05.920
You will. It just takes time.

43:05.920 --> 43:07.600
       I'm ready now.  I see.

43:07.600 --> 43:11.600
Like an eaglet ready to fly
from the nest? Like a salmon
ready to swim upstream?

43:12.000 --> 43:13.040
                               Mm-hm.

43:13.040 --> 43:17.040
Like a lemming...  Never mind.

43:23.640 --> 43:26.720
I'm going to go home and call
my family and tell them the news.

43:26.720 --> 43:27.800
That's great.

43:27.800 --> 43:30.040
Do you want to come? Say hello?

43:30.040 --> 43:33.120
I'd love to, but I'm just
about to start my shift.

43:33.120 --> 43:36.040
OK, well, I'll see you tomorrow.

43:36.040 --> 43:37.280
              See ya.

43:37.280 --> 43:40.120
Oh, I'm so happy!

43:40.120 --> 43:43.880
Dr and Mrs Wayne Fiscus.

43:43.880 --> 43:47.520
     Dr and Mrs Wayne Fiscus.

43:47.520 --> 43:48.560
Bye.  Bye.

43:48.560 --> 43:52.560
(WHISPERING) Love you.

43:54.400 --> 43:56.840
         What have I done?

43:56.840 --> 43:58.760
            St Eligius.

43:58.760 --> 44:02.640
No, Dr Caldwell's left for the day.

44:02.640 --> 44:04.960
      Oh, yes, Mr Mountear...

44:04.960 --> 44:06.600
         Your mother died?

44:06.600 --> 44:09.720
     I'm sorry, I'll tell him.

44:09.720 --> 44:11.520
You still here?

44:11.520 --> 44:15.520
I haven't pulled an all-nighter
since my days in the Pacific Theatre.

44:15.520 --> 44:18.040
      I've just had an idea.

44:18.040 --> 44:22.040
Blackout must be over.

44:23.680 --> 44:25.840
Oh! Give me some help here, please.

44:25.840 --> 44:29.200
Watch that shoulder, Daniel,
it's dislocated. Get that gurney.

44:29.200 --> 44:30.880
He's got a tibial fracture, too.

44:30.880 --> 44:32.280
Ow!

44:32.280 --> 44:33.680
Take it easy. Take it easy.

44:33.680 --> 44:35.880
All right. ER, Helen.

44:35.880 --> 44:37.600
                                 OK.

44:37.600 --> 44:41.600
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
My name is Donald, man.

44:42.400 --> 44:46.400
So is mine.

44:47.000 --> 44:51.000
So you be cool, Donald.

44:54.600 --> 44:55.960
        You look wretched.

44:55.960 --> 44:59.640
Well, I don't think you could win
any beauty contests today, either.

44:59.640 --> 45:01.440
Blackout's over.

45:01.440 --> 45:03.520
Thank God. Much damage?

45:03.520 --> 45:05.160
Nothing we couldn't handle.

45:05.160 --> 45:08.480
You know, you may think I'm crazy,

45:08.480 --> 45:11.680
but despite all the trouble,
I rather enjoyed myself.

45:11.680 --> 45:15.040
There was a kind of
moonstruck fantasy to the place.

45:15.040 --> 45:18.440
Sort of
Midwinter Night's Dream, so to speak.

45:18.440 --> 45:22.440
Yeah. I know this is no
big universal question but there's
something I've never understood.

45:24.760 --> 45:27.520
How does electricity work?
Why is it always there?

45:27.520 --> 45:29.840
It would be great
if the human spirit

45:29.840 --> 45:33.640
could be recharged that simply.

45:33.640 --> 45:35.240
You're in one of those moods?

45:35.240 --> 45:36.840
I'm ready for slumber.

45:36.840 --> 45:39.840
Ah-ha, Donald, I get it, now that
the shooting has stopped,

45:39.840 --> 45:41.880
you've decided
to come back to work(!)

45:41.880 --> 45:43.520
Actually...  Save the excuses.

45:43.520 --> 45:47.520
When the going gets tough,
the interners go home.

45:48.360 --> 45:50.400
&lt; Mark, I wouldn't get on that one.

45:50.400 --> 45:54.400
Well, I guess there's a lot of
things I'd do, that you wouldn't.

46:00.040 --> 46:02.040
THUDDING

46:02.040 --> 46:03.440
Hey! We're stuck! &gt;

46:03.440 --> 46:05.280
We'll get on it right away, Mark!

46:05.280 --> 46:09.280
God! What a stench! &gt;

46:25.680 --> 46:40.000
