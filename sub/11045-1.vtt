WEBVTT

00:02.736 --> 00:08.576
OK. Library... library... Where
did they put the library?

00:14.582 --> 00:17.485
[sigh] This Castle looked a
lot smaller from the outside.

00:21.589 --> 00:22.790
Morning, Starlight.

00:22.823 --> 00:24.558
Whoops!

00:24.592 --> 00:28.362
Sorry, Spike! I guess I'm still
trying to find my way around.

00:28.396 --> 00:31.332
You don't happen to know
where the library is, do you?

00:31.365 --> 00:32.400
Next door on the left.

00:32.433 --> 00:33.801
[slam]

00:33.834 --> 00:36.404
Oh. Thanks.

00:36.437 --> 00:40.208
Acceptance, mm-hmm,
Altruism, definitely.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.443
Starlight! Good
morning! Come in!

00:42.476 --> 00:45.279
Sorry I'm late. I got
a little turned around.

00:45.313 --> 00:48.149
I still can't believe you're
letting me stay here.

00:48.182 --> 00:52.286
As your pupil. After
everything I did.

00:52.320 --> 00:55.656
Well, I'm not one to dwell on
the past and neither should you.

00:55.689 --> 00:59.493
The castle is your home now and
as far as being my pupil goes...

00:59.527 --> 01:01.262
I was just trying to figure out

01:01.295 --> 01:03.297
what your first friendship
lesson should be!

01:03.331 --> 01:06.167
Oh. Well, it looks like you're
really narrowing it down.

01:06.200 --> 01:09.103
Oh, these are just the As. After
this, I move on to the Bs!

01:17.145 --> 01:20.448
* My little pony,
my little pony *

01:20.481 --> 01:22.383
* Aaaahhh

01:22.416 --> 01:24.452
* My little Pony

01:24.485 --> 01:26.854
* I used to wonder what
friendship could be. *

01:26.887 --> 01:28.722
* My Little Pony

01:28.756 --> 01:31.325
* Until you all shared
its magic with me. *

01:31.359 --> 01:33.394
* Big adventure!
* Tons of fun

01:33.427 --> 01:35.563
* A beautiful heart! *
Faithful and strong! *

01:35.596 --> 01:37.698
* Sharing kindness
* it's an easy feat

01:37.731 --> 01:39.700
* And magic makes it
all complete! *

01:39.733 --> 01:41.835
* To have my little pony

01:41.869 --> 01:45.339
* Do you know you're all
my very best friends? *

01:45.373 --> 01:47.541
**

01:53.547 --> 01:55.483
Starlight: I know I'm just
learning about friendship,

01:55.516 --> 01:58.586
but I didn't think there were
this many lessons for anything.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.388
How do we choose?

02:00.421 --> 02:03.557
Maybe I should pare things down
a bit before we go through them.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.726
Why don't you join the
others in the throne room?

02:05.759 --> 02:07.728
They're planning our trip
to the Crystal Empire

02:07.761 --> 02:10.498
when Shining Armor and Princess
Cadance have their baby.

02:10.531 --> 02:11.765
Throne room. Got it!

02:14.502 --> 02:17.205
Um, which way is
the throne room?

02:17.238 --> 02:19.307
[sigh]

02:19.340 --> 02:21.509
Rainbow Dash: Well, I think
we should leave ASAP!

02:21.542 --> 02:23.377
I don't want to miss
the Crystalling!

02:23.411 --> 02:26.514
But, um, shouldn't we
wait for the invitation?

02:26.547 --> 02:29.183
Frankly, I'm not exactly
clear on all the customs

02:29.217 --> 02:31.219
and traditions of
the Crystal Empire.

02:31.252 --> 02:33.287
Especially when it
comes to a Crystalling.

02:33.321 --> 02:34.855
What's a Crystalling?

02:34.888 --> 02:36.890
Well, that's just
it, Darling.

02:36.924 --> 02:40.428
Princess Cadance and Shining
Armor's baby is due any day

02:40.461 --> 02:42.430
and we're still not sure.

02:42.463 --> 02:45.666
The Crystal Empire was
gone for a thousand years.

02:45.699 --> 02:48.702
A lot of their customs
are a bit murky.

02:48.736 --> 02:50.971
We know it's got something
to do with the new baby.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.606
And a party!

02:52.640 --> 02:53.707
And the Crystal Heart.

02:53.741 --> 02:54.908
And a party!

02:54.942 --> 02:57.245
And some kind of cool energy.

02:57.278 --> 02:58.312
And...

02:58.346 --> 02:59.680
A PARTY!

03:02.416 --> 03:04.385
Spike: It's not
hard to understand.

03:04.418 --> 03:07.588
Most things in the
Crystal Empire aren't.

03:07.621 --> 03:10.324
Like how I'm a big hero
there, for example.

03:16.997 --> 03:18.566
Plus, I've had to help Twilight

03:18.599 --> 03:19.967
do a lot of research
on Crystallings.

03:21.502 --> 03:23.704
Whenever a baby is born
in the Crystal Empire,

03:23.737 --> 03:26.440
the parents bring it
before the Crystal Heart.

03:26.474 --> 03:28.842
They get the purest shard
of crystal they can find,

03:28.876 --> 03:31.245
then pick a Crystaller
to present the baby

03:31.279 --> 03:33.247
to everypony who comes.

03:33.281 --> 03:36.016
Then they all share the
light and joy they feel,

03:36.049 --> 03:38.552
feeding it into the crystal
that joins with the Heart

03:38.586 --> 03:41.389
and increases its power.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.657
And this is going to
be a Royal Crystalling,

03:43.691 --> 03:45.693
so pretty much the whole
Empire will show up.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.395
That hasn't happened
in a millennia.

03:49.062 --> 03:52.032
What do you mean it increases
the Crystal Heart's power?

03:52.065 --> 03:54.835
The energy it uses to protect
the Crystal Empire, I guess.

03:54.868 --> 03:57.305
Protect it from what?

03:57.338 --> 03:58.972
I didn't help Twilight
with that part.

04:07.348 --> 04:08.949
Hey, Twilight, can
I ask you something

04:08.982 --> 04:10.651
about the Crystal Empire?

04:10.684 --> 04:12.886
Ha! Funny you
should mention it...

04:12.920 --> 04:14.822
Because I just narrowed your
first friendship lesson

04:14.855 --> 04:16.390
down to three options.

04:16.424 --> 04:18.292
And one of them is in
the Crystal Empire.

04:18.326 --> 04:20.328
Really?

04:20.361 --> 04:21.862
I found out that's
where the first pony

04:21.895 --> 04:23.331
you ever cared about lives!

04:23.364 --> 04:24.632
Sunburst?

04:24.665 --> 04:26.800
Of course that's just one idea.

04:26.834 --> 04:29.437
We could also go to
Griffinstone.[voice fades]

04:29.470 --> 04:31.872
Making friends with a Griffin
is a challenge all by itself.

04:31.905 --> 04:33.841
Or we could tag
along with the CMCs

04:33.874 --> 04:36.844
the next time they help a
pony who can't figure out

04:36.877 --> 04:39.680
Starlight, is something wrong?

04:39.713 --> 04:43.517
What? Oh, no. Those
all sound great.

04:43.551 --> 04:45.085
I know! I guess you
were right.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.421
It is going to be
hard to choose one.

04:47.455 --> 04:49.089
[nervous laugh]

04:49.122 --> 04:50.391
Yeah.

04:53.461 --> 04:54.428
[crash]

04:56.897 --> 04:57.931
[slam]

05:03.404 --> 05:07.040
Ugh! I am never going to find
my way around this place!

05:07.074 --> 05:09.009
Gee, Starlight, what's wrong?

05:09.042 --> 05:10.243
I don't know, Spike.

05:10.277 --> 05:13.647
Twilight's figuring out what
my first friendship lesson is

05:13.681 --> 05:17.017
and I guess I'm not exactly
thrilled with the options.

05:17.050 --> 05:19.520
Well, with one of them.

05:19.553 --> 05:20.821
Which one?

05:20.854 --> 05:24.358
Reuniting me with
my first friend.

05:24.392 --> 05:25.826
What's so terrible about that?

05:27.461 --> 05:28.462
[sigh]

05:30.764 --> 05:32.433
When we were foals,

05:32.466 --> 05:34.868
Sunburst knew everything there
was to know about magic.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.747
He always knew just what to do.

05:51.118 --> 05:53.120
[bubbles]

05:55.589 --> 05:58.592
And he was always
there to help me.

05:58.626 --> 06:01.395
[whoosh]

06:08.569 --> 06:11.505
I guess it's not surprising that
Sunburst got his cutie mark

06:11.539 --> 06:13.541
in magic and went off to
Princess Celestia's school.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.776
But when he left...

06:15.809 --> 06:18.779
You blamed cutie marks and
stripped a whole village

06:18.812 --> 06:21.148
of theirs and when Twilight
and the others stopped you,

06:21.181 --> 06:23.116
you went back in time and
almost destroyed Equestria.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.918
[poof]

06:24.952 --> 06:28.155
Not really stuff I'm super
eager to tell Sunburst about.

06:28.188 --> 06:31.959
I mean, he's probably some
big, important wizard now

06:31.992 --> 06:35.896
and I can't even find my way
around Twilight's Castle.

06:35.929 --> 06:38.566
Well, if Sunburst is
that good at magic,

06:38.599 --> 06:41.502
maybe he'd appreciate
your [ahem] exploits.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.172
You should talk to
Twilight about it.

06:45.205 --> 06:47.741
I'm sure she'd want to
hear what you have to say.

06:47.775 --> 06:51.545
I know, but I don't want her to
think I'm not ready to learn

06:51.579 --> 06:54.181
or that I'm not grateful
for everything she's doing.

06:54.214 --> 06:56.550
Twilight: SPIKE! COME QUICK!

06:56.584 --> 07:01.589
[whistling wind]

07:01.622 --> 07:06.760
**

07:06.794 --> 07:08.762
It's a Crystalling invitation!

07:08.796 --> 07:12.633
Shining Armor's a
father! I'm an Aunt!

07:12.666 --> 07:14.502
Well, this settles it.

07:14.535 --> 07:16.103
Since we're going to
the Crystal Empire,

07:16.136 --> 07:18.872
your first friendship
lesson is going to be

07:18.906 --> 07:21.875
reuniting with Sunburst!

07:21.909 --> 07:23.477
Great.

07:28.682 --> 07:31.451
[train chugging and whistle]

07:38.091 --> 07:41.595
[yawn]

07:41.629 --> 07:44.832
Um, Applejack, what is that?

07:44.865 --> 07:46.767
Oh, just a little
something for the young'un.

07:48.301 --> 07:51.672
Made from genuine Sweet
Apple Acres apple trees.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.273
We make 'em for all the Apples

07:53.306 --> 07:57.277
and anypony related to Twilight
is practically family.

07:57.310 --> 08:03.551
Yeah. It's OK, but it's no
Cloudsdale Mobile...BAM!

08:03.584 --> 08:05.853
Oooh! Pretty!

08:08.155 --> 08:10.958
Well, a mobile is real nice...

08:10.991 --> 08:14.294
as long as you have something to
lay in so you can look at it.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.998
And a fetching blanket
to keep you warm.

08:18.031 --> 08:20.200
I'm sure Shining Armor
and Princess Cadance

08:20.233 --> 08:22.936
will love all our gifts, but
I think they're more happy

08:22.970 --> 08:25.539
we'll be attending the
baby's Crystalling.

08:25.573 --> 08:27.908
Ooh! I can't wait to see
all that light and love

08:27.941 --> 08:30.744
make the Crystal Heart even
more sparkly and shiny!

08:30.778 --> 08:32.780
Actually, Pinkie,
the Crystal Heart

08:32.813 --> 08:34.715
is an ancient and
powerful relic.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.850
Without its magic, the
Crystal Empire would be lost

08:36.884 --> 08:38.318
to the Frozen North.

08:38.351 --> 08:42.723
Wow. This Crystalling
sounds pretty important.

08:42.756 --> 08:45.926
I'd understand if you
wanted to, you know,

08:45.959 --> 08:48.596
wait to do a different
friendship lesson

08:48.629 --> 08:50.097
when we get back.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.733
Are you kidding?
This trip is perfect.

08:52.766 --> 08:55.936
Not only do I get to see the
baby and take part in a ceremony

08:55.969 --> 08:58.071
that helps maintain the
magic of the Crystal Empire,

08:58.105 --> 09:00.240
but I'm starting
my new pupil off

09:00.273 --> 09:04.044
with the most amazing friendship
lesson ever. I can't wait!

09:04.077 --> 09:07.014
Right. Me neither.

09:11.084 --> 09:14.154
Actually, Twilight,
I am a little worried

09:14.187 --> 09:16.256
about meeting Sunburst.

09:16.289 --> 09:19.359
Oh, trust me, I know what
it's like to see old friends,

09:19.392 --> 09:21.762
but I'll be right there
to help things along.

09:21.795 --> 09:24.231
I've broken the whole lesson
down into a few easy steps

09:24.264 --> 09:26.900
to ensure this reunion
goes off without a hitch.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.669
[nervous giggle]

09:28.702 --> 09:31.371
[clattering train wheels]

09:31.404 --> 09:32.940
[squeaking brakes]

09:35.075 --> 09:37.645
Step one, head to Sunburst's
house and get you two started

09:37.678 --> 09:39.212
on the right hoof.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.882
Step two, get to the Castle with
enough time to visit the baby.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.752
[gasp] Shining Armor!

09:44.785 --> 09:46.920
Twilight!

09:46.954 --> 09:48.989
I didn't know you
were meeting us.

09:49.022 --> 09:52.693
Of course I am. It's me.
Right here. Here I am.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.795
Why wouldn't I come
meet my sister?

09:54.828 --> 09:57.264
Though we have met before.

09:57.297 --> 09:58.899
Are you all right?

09:58.932 --> 10:02.135
Never better! Being a father
is amazing and wonderful

10:02.169 --> 10:05.338
and amazing and
confusing and amazing...

10:05.372 --> 10:07.775
But surprising too, you know?

10:07.808 --> 10:10.944
I mean, not that you'd know. You
wouldn't know, I know. You know?

10:13.113 --> 10:17.017
Sorry. I haven't really slept
since Cadance had the baby.

10:17.050 --> 10:20.120
Come to think of it,
she hasn't either.

10:20.153 --> 10:22.155
It sure would be
great to get a break.

10:22.189 --> 10:25.759
Oh. Of course. I don't
know what I was thinking.

10:25.793 --> 10:28.095
You two probably need
all kinds of help!

10:28.128 --> 10:30.698
I'm sorry, Starlight,
but I guess combining

10:30.731 --> 10:34.034
your first lesson with this
visit wasn't such a good idea.

10:34.067 --> 10:38.038
Oh, don't be ridiculous!
You're an aunt now.

10:38.071 --> 10:42.309
That's way more important
than some friendship lesson.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.344
I just wish there
was a way to do both.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.816
Maybe there is.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.350
You've already done the
work for Starlight's lesson

10:50.383 --> 10:51.752
with this list.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.887
All we have to do is follow it.

10:53.921 --> 10:56.256
Spike, you're a genius!

10:56.289 --> 10:59.860
Yeah. Genius.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.228
Then it's settled.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.396
Shining Armor and I will
head straight to the castle

11:03.430 --> 11:05.733
and you two can head
straight to Sunburst's.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.000
Aye, aye, princess.

11:11.204 --> 11:12.806
All right, big brother.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.275
Let's go see this
amazing baby pony.

11:15.308 --> 11:19.079
[snoring]

11:22.182 --> 11:24.284
I know you're a little
worried about this reunion,

11:24.317 --> 11:27.120
but I'm sure Twilight's
got everything covered.

11:27.154 --> 11:31.358
Everything except how I'd rather
do absolutely anything else.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.894
I bet she's taken
that into account too.

11:33.927 --> 11:38.031
It's all part of the
lesson. Trust the lesson.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.199
Right.

11:43.203 --> 11:46.139
Hey, is that you?

11:46.173 --> 11:48.909
Oh. Yep. It sure is.

11:48.942 --> 11:51.779
Now... according to the
list, Sunburst's house is--

11:51.812 --> 11:54.915
Why is there a statue of
you in the Crystal Empire?

11:54.948 --> 11:57.217
Because Spike, the
brave and glorious,

11:57.250 --> 11:59.887
saved all of us
from King Sombra.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.255
And then again during
the Equestria Games.

12:02.289 --> 12:03.290
Really?

12:03.323 --> 12:04.992
Really! Big fan.

12:06.426 --> 12:09.162
Um, when were you going
to tell me about this?

12:09.196 --> 12:11.464
Oh, it's no big deal.

12:11.498 --> 12:14.434
IT MOST CERTAINLY IS!

12:14.467 --> 12:16.536
That's it.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.439
We're not going anywhere
until I get the whole story.

12:24.878 --> 12:28.882
Before we go in, I should
probably tell you,

12:28.916 --> 12:32.185
seeing the baby might
be a bit of a shock.

12:32.219 --> 12:35.288
Come on, big brother,
I've met babies before.

12:35.322 --> 12:37.390
I expect meeting this one
won't be any different.

12:41.361 --> 12:42.796
[gasp]

12:42.830 --> 12:45.365
[cooing]

12:45.398 --> 12:47.767
Of course, I could be wrong.

12:51.004 --> 12:52.873
**

12:52.906 --> 12:55.042
[cooing]

12:55.075 --> 12:58.011
The baby is an Alicorn?

12:58.045 --> 13:00.080
It looks that way.

13:00.113 --> 13:03.083
But I thought Alicorn
wings had to be earned

13:03.116 --> 13:06.519
by accomplishing some great
princess-worthy deed.

13:06.553 --> 13:09.322
Yeah, how can you just
be born with them?

13:09.356 --> 13:10.824
The birth of an Alicorn

13:10.858 --> 13:13.360
is something Equestria
has never seen.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.996
It is beyond even
our understanding.

13:16.029 --> 13:18.231
That's not very reassuring.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.901
Wow, a unicorn and a Pegasus!

13:20.934 --> 13:25.205
So, she could be a super strong
flyer and have crazy baby magic.

13:25.238 --> 13:28.241
Well, I know all about
super strong flying.

13:28.275 --> 13:31.078
And I can help keep
tabs on her magic.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.513
[starting to sneeze]

13:33.546 --> 13:34.882
[achoo/crash]

13:43.423 --> 13:45.859
It appears her magic
is more powerful

13:45.893 --> 13:48.028
than that of a newborn unicorn.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.829
The crowds have already
started to gather.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.968
This Crystalling is
gonna be some party!

13:55.002 --> 13:55.903
[pop]

13:57.004 --> 13:59.272
Do you think we
should call it off?

13:59.306 --> 14:03.443
Um, we've all faced a lot
worse than baby magic.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.012
I can't imagine cancelling

14:05.045 --> 14:07.014
such a beautiful and
important ceremony

14:07.047 --> 14:09.516
over something so
potentially adorable.

14:09.549 --> 14:12.319
Yeah! Of course! Come on!

14:12.352 --> 14:14.487
In light of the little
one's abilities,

14:14.521 --> 14:17.891
this Crystalling might be
more important than ever.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.526
Perhaps you should
address your subjects

14:19.559 --> 14:20.961
and remind them of that.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.970
[snoring]

14:30.003 --> 14:31.571
Shining Armor, do you
have everything you need

14:31.604 --> 14:33.673
for the ceremony?

14:33.706 --> 14:37.978
Huh? Oh! NO! I still have to
interview the Honor Guards,

14:38.011 --> 14:40.213
chose the Purity Crystal
and pick a Crystaller!

14:42.282 --> 14:43.951
All right. Take it easy.

14:43.984 --> 14:46.419
Pinkie can stay here with me
and keep an eye on the baby.

14:48.655 --> 14:51.959
And we'll all help you
with everything else.

14:51.992 --> 14:55.996
[snoring and muttering]

14:56.029 --> 14:58.465
That is if you can stay awake
long enough to tell us how.

15:00.167 --> 15:02.035
And that's how we found
the Crystal Heart,

15:02.069 --> 15:04.671
defeated King Sombra
and saved the Empire.

15:04.704 --> 15:07.941
Yay! We love you, Spike! Yeah!

15:07.975 --> 15:10.677
Tell the one about
the Equestria Games!

15:10.710 --> 15:14.381
Well, as much as I love
reliving my heroic deeds,

15:14.414 --> 15:16.649
Starlight and I have an
important lesson to do

15:16.683 --> 15:19.052
by order of the
Princess of Friendship.

15:19.086 --> 15:21.021
AWWWWW!

15:21.054 --> 15:25.025
Oh, come on, Spike. I want to
hear about the Games, too.

15:25.058 --> 15:27.627
I know you're nervous
about seeing Sunburst,

15:27.660 --> 15:30.063
but it says right
in step three to,

15:30.097 --> 15:33.100
"deal with your fears by facing
them," not by putting it off.

15:34.701 --> 15:38.005
Ugh. Let's go get
this over with.

15:38.038 --> 15:44.044
* [tense music]

15:44.077 --> 15:45.045
Wait!

15:45.078 --> 15:46.479
What?

15:46.513 --> 15:48.648
Knocking on the door isn't
the next thing on the list.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.217
Seriously?

15:50.250 --> 15:52.185
I know Twilight can
be a little nitpicky,

15:52.219 --> 15:54.221
but this is your first
lesson as her pupil

15:54.254 --> 15:56.289
and it's important
that we do it right.

15:56.323 --> 16:00.727
Fine. What's the next
thing on the list?

16:00.760 --> 16:04.231
"Before they see each other,
make sure to highlight

16:04.264 --> 16:06.266
the importance of the meeting."

16:06.299 --> 16:09.669
I don't know.I'm pretty sure
we can skip that.

16:09.702 --> 16:12.405
I mean, if we skip it, the
whole lesson could go south.

16:12.439 --> 16:14.607
And then you might end up
taking a giant step backwards

16:14.641 --> 16:16.043
instead of forwards.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.610
Maybe you'll never be
able to learn anything

16:17.644 --> 16:19.312
about friendship at all.

16:19.346 --> 16:23.450
It's almost like your whole
future depends on this moment.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.586
"Highlight the importance
of the meeting." Check.

16:26.619 --> 16:28.355
I can't believe you
wanted to skip that.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.126
[knock knock knock]

16:42.202 --> 16:44.037
Sunburst?

16:44.071 --> 16:46.273
Yes? What can I do for you?

16:46.306 --> 16:49.676
It's, it's me. Starlight.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.411
We used to be friends?

16:54.114 --> 16:59.386
Oh, of course! Starlight. My
goodness, it's been a long time.

16:59.419 --> 17:02.255
What, what have
you been up to?

17:02.289 --> 17:07.627
Me? Oh, you know, some
of this, some of that.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.530
Different stuff.

17:10.563 --> 17:13.733
Right now I'm sort of,
Twilight Sparkle's new pupil.

17:13.766 --> 17:16.136
The Princess of Friendship?

17:16.169 --> 17:20.640
Heh. Yeah. That's actually
kind of why I'm here.

17:20.673 --> 17:23.776
I mean, I know you're
probably very busy.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.378
What do you mean?

17:25.412 --> 17:27.514
Well, I figured
after Magic School,

17:27.547 --> 17:30.550
you'd go on to do important
wizard work, but...

17:30.583 --> 17:35.755
Oh. No. Yes. Oh yes, that's
me. Yep. Important wizard.

17:35.788 --> 17:38.725
Really busy with lots of,
uh... wizarding stuff.

17:41.494 --> 17:44.564
Right, well Good to see you.

17:44.597 --> 17:46.399
[door closes]

17:46.433 --> 17:48.468
Huh. Maybe we
should have skipped

17:48.501 --> 17:51.371
"highlighting the importance
of the meeting" after all.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.406
Well? I guess that's that!

17:53.440 --> 17:55.508
Starlight, come on!

17:55.542 --> 17:58.278
We have to at least explain
what Twilight wants!

17:58.311 --> 17:59.512
Ugh.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.382
[knocking]

18:07.187 --> 18:11.691
Dearest Citizens, I am sure
you are all just as thrilled

18:11.724 --> 18:15.628
and ready for this Crystalling
as myself and Shining Armor.

18:15.662 --> 18:19.332
[cheers]

18:19.366 --> 18:23.836
[gasp] I'm not ready!

18:23.870 --> 18:25.104
Take it easy.

18:25.138 --> 18:28.441
Just pick whoever looks the
most like Honor Guard material.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.243
Right. Right!

18:33.880 --> 18:35.482
I'm sorry;

18:35.515 --> 18:38.718
fatherhood is way more
stressful than I ever thought.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.887
I can only imagine.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.490
Now, I know choosing
the crystal of purity

18:43.523 --> 18:45.592
is a very important decision,

18:45.625 --> 18:48.295
so I have gone through the
trouble of arranging them

18:48.328 --> 18:52.465
in order from incredibly
pure to outrageously pure.

18:52.499 --> 18:56.203
Um, Rarity? Don't they
all sort of look the same?

18:56.236 --> 18:59.172
Oh well, to the
untrained eye, perhaps.

18:59.206 --> 19:02.642
What do you think,
Shining Armor?

19:02.675 --> 19:04.244
I DON'T KNOW!

19:06.313 --> 19:07.814
[whispers] I hope
Twilight and Pinkie

19:07.847 --> 19:09.616
are having better
luck with the baby.

19:11.451 --> 19:14.821
Well, at least she's having fun!

19:14.854 --> 19:22.695
[baby gurgling happily]

19:22.729 --> 19:24.464
Pinkie, hold her still!

19:24.497 --> 19:26.399
I'm trying!

19:34.907 --> 19:39.679
So, the Princess of
Friendship wants you and I

19:39.712 --> 19:41.648
to be friends again?

19:41.681 --> 19:45.918
I know. Weird, right?

19:45.952 --> 19:47.587
I don't understand.

19:47.620 --> 19:50.723
Did something happen to you
after I left for Magic School?

19:50.757 --> 19:54.694
What? No! I don't see what
that has to do with anything.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.195
Why would you even ask that?

19:58.565 --> 20:01.568
I mean, did something
happen to you

20:01.601 --> 20:03.736
after you left for magic school?

20:03.770 --> 20:10.277
What? Um. No. Like you said,
I'm a [ahem] important wizard.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.614
I'm sure there's something
on Twilight's list

20:14.647 --> 20:15.782
that can help here.

20:18.618 --> 20:22.322
[gasping]

20:24.591 --> 20:27.827
OK. I chose the Honor Guard,
picked the Purity Crystal

20:27.860 --> 20:30.630
and I know exactly who I
want to be our Crystaller.

20:30.663 --> 20:32.432
So, all we need is...

20:34.066 --> 20:35.335
The baby?

20:36.469 --> 20:38.471
We're here!

20:38.505 --> 20:40.973
She's a really strong flyer!

20:45.912 --> 20:53.353
[whimpering]

20:53.386 --> 20:58.791
[wail]

21:00.760 --> 21:02.962
[cracking]

21:02.995 --> 21:04.063
[shatter]

21:04.096 --> 21:12.605
**

21:12.639 --> 21:15.942
I'm guessing that's gonna make
it hard to do the Crystalling.

21:15.975 --> 21:17.644
It's worse than that...

21:17.677 --> 21:20.513
Without the Heart, the Crystal
Empire is about to be buried

21:20.547 --> 21:23.450
under a mountain
of ice and snow!

21:23.483 --> 21:27.787
* [dramatic]

21:27.820 --> 21:30.823
[gurgle]
