[Julien wailing]

00:43.377 --> 00:48.507
Stop, no! For the love of all
that is good and decent, do not do this!

00:48.590 --> 00:50.551
It's just a vacation.

00:51.218 --> 00:54.513
Don't you understand
what will happen if you go?

00:54.596 --> 00:56.891
You will have to make
decisions on your own

00:56.974 --> 00:59.267
without the psychic guidance
of my tongue?

00:59.351 --> 01:02.730
Yes! The horror, the horror!

01:02.813 --> 01:06.441
King Julien, you have never had trouble
making decisions in the past.

01:06.525 --> 01:08.151
Why the sudden panic?

01:08.235 --> 01:09.361
Well...

01:09.444 --> 01:13.240
Uh, King Julien,
why am I wearing cod pieces?

01:13.323 --> 01:14.992
Foosa camouflage, Willie.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.745
I have decided to make peace
with our enemies.

01:17.828 --> 01:20.205
Foosa eat lemurs, not fish.

01:20.288 --> 01:24.209
This disguise will give you enough time
to negotiate a treaty.

01:24.292 --> 01:27.212
- Oh, okay-- Aah! Aah!
- [roars]

01:27.295 --> 01:30.215
How's it going, Willie?
Making any new friends yet?

01:30.298 --> 01:31.550
[belch]

01:31.633 --> 01:35.429
King Julien, the kingdom looks amazing.
What happened to all the garbage?

01:35.512 --> 01:37.222
Gone, Maurice.

01:37.305 --> 01:40.893
I decided to have Mort gather up
all the kingdom's refuse

01:40.976 --> 01:45.064
and toss it in that smelly mountain pit
on the other side of the island.

01:45.146 --> 01:47.775
Smelly mountain?
You mean the volcano?!

01:47.858 --> 01:51.028
- [rumbling]
- [Mort] Make a hole!

01:51.111 --> 01:55.365
King Julien, Maurice just told me
you're giving me a new, uh... partner?!

01:55.449 --> 01:58.326
That's correct, Clover.
To better protect our kingdom,

01:58.410 --> 02:02.414
I have decided to have Timo design you
a new crime-fighting buddy.

02:02.497 --> 02:03.540
Observe.

02:03.624 --> 02:04.959
- [roars]
- Aah!

02:05.042 --> 02:08.169
I'm calling it the Mega-gecko 2.0.

02:08.253 --> 02:09.630
- [roars]
- Hyah!

02:09.713 --> 02:11.673
[Clover yelling]

02:11.757 --> 02:15.010
Ah, look at that,
you're getting along already.

02:15.094 --> 02:18.013
Yes, those were bad decisions.

02:18.097 --> 02:21.558
I know. It's like I lost
my decision-making mojo.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.727
Which is why you cannot go!

02:23.811 --> 02:25.813
[wailing] Please!

02:25.896 --> 02:29.190
And while you're staying,
would you mind rubbing my belly?

02:29.274 --> 02:31.860
- I am so tense.
- [groans]

02:31.944 --> 02:36.615
Actually, I may have a solution
to both of our problems.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.826
I should have told you this
earlier in your reign,

02:38.909 --> 02:41.536
but there exists a, um...

02:41.620 --> 02:44.247
vessel! Yes!

02:44.331 --> 02:47.501
And it is filled with great wisdom.

02:47.584 --> 02:50.754
A vessel? Like my party boat,
Old Porcelain Suds?

02:50.838 --> 02:53.007
Yes-- No, not a toilet.

02:53.090 --> 02:56.593
A vessel that contains
the souls and wisdom

02:56.677 --> 03:00.472
of all the previous kings
who ever sat in that throne.

03:00.555 --> 03:02.599
The wisdom of every king?

03:02.683 --> 03:04.059
That's, like, uh...

03:05.184 --> 03:07.604
12 brains!
That's a lot of brains!

03:07.688 --> 03:09.272
And you are in luck.

03:09.356 --> 03:14.193
For the vessel of which I speak
is kept in this very room,

03:14.277 --> 03:18.115
right... over...

03:18.197 --> 03:19.992
- there!
- Hmm?

03:24.412 --> 03:25.998
Uh, a pineapple?

03:26.081 --> 03:28.500
Do you not see the majestic crown?

03:28.583 --> 03:33.547
Sense the succulent inner juices,
so reminiscent of your own.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.382
Hmm. I am juicy.

03:35.465 --> 03:37.968
With this vessel by your side,

03:38.052 --> 03:41.388
you will have all you need
to make the right decisions

03:41.471 --> 03:44.099
for yourself and the kingdom.

03:44.183 --> 03:47.352
Wait a second.
How do I know you're not just saying this

03:47.435 --> 03:49.354
so you can go on your vacation?

03:49.437 --> 03:51.106
I, uh...

03:51.190 --> 03:56.195
Kidding! Of course my kingly soul
will live on in a pineapple after I die.

03:56.277 --> 03:58.072
It makes perfect sense.

03:58.155 --> 04:03.284
Now to use the souls of my ancestors
to be the best king I can be.

04:03.368 --> 04:04.786
[grunting]

04:04.870 --> 04:05.996
Ha ha ha!

04:06.080 --> 04:09.750
- No, it's my foosa ball!
- It's my foosa ball!

04:10.584 --> 04:12.878
Allow me to use the wisdom
of my ancestors

04:12.961 --> 04:16.048
to settle this dispute for you, children.

04:16.131 --> 04:18.800
What's that, King Julien the Resolver?

04:18.884 --> 04:21.887
Yes. I have a solution.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.346
- Huh?
- There you go.

04:23.430 --> 04:26.307
Now go to your huts
and atrophy like normal children.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.476
- [children sobbing]
- You're welcome!

04:28.560 --> 04:32.313
King Julien, the foosa have taken
my wife Dorothy!

04:32.397 --> 04:33.941
What do I do?

04:34.024 --> 04:36.944
Hold on. What's that,
King Julien the Player?

04:37.027 --> 04:38.946
Mm-hmm. Word.

04:39.029 --> 04:42.490
Okay, dead King Julien says,
"Lemur up, Ted,

04:42.574 --> 04:46.120
and get back on the horse.
Lots of fish in the sea, you know?"

04:46.203 --> 04:47.996
Lemurs, too,
during the warm season.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.831
Mmm, mmm.

04:49.915 --> 04:51.583
- Ted!
- Oh, Dorothy!

04:51.666 --> 04:53.627
I thought you were eaten by the foosa.

04:53.710 --> 04:56.504
No, I was just in the other room.
I'm alive.

04:56.588 --> 04:59.299
Really? Okay, then.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.470
Oh, hey.
King Julien, could you help me?

05:03.553 --> 05:06.473
I can't decide if I should pull
one of these small rocks out.

05:06.556 --> 05:08.892
Very interesting problem.

05:08.976 --> 05:12.771
Let me consult King Julien
the Painfully Oblivious.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.399
Go for it, baby!

05:16.483 --> 05:20.028
Aah! Thanks for the advice,
Your Majesty!

05:20.112 --> 05:22.239
[Julien]
You're welcome!

05:22.322 --> 05:24.574
[Maurice]
Ohh, King Julien,

05:24.658 --> 05:27.911
what is so important that you called us
here in the middle of the night?

05:27.995 --> 05:30.080
Was there a sudden
and unexpected security breach

05:30.164 --> 05:31.957
that requires my immediate attention?

05:32.040 --> 05:34.793
Please, tell me there was a sudden
and unexpected security breach

05:34.876 --> 05:36.795
that requires my immediate attention!

05:37.879 --> 05:42.884
No! I called you here to inform you
of an important epiphany I had

05:42.968 --> 05:45.053
earlier this very afternoon.

05:45.137 --> 05:47.973
It isn't the one about
not pooping where you eat again, is it?

05:48.056 --> 05:50.517
No, Maurice.
Though that was a very good one, too,

05:50.600 --> 05:52.686
and really brought things
into focus for me

05:52.769 --> 05:54.980
at a very difficult time in my life.

05:55.063 --> 05:57.983
Say hello to my new kingly advisor.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.320
I'm going back to bed.

06:02.321 --> 06:04.531
Wait! You must not leave

06:04.614 --> 06:08.409
until you swear
to protect the pineapple with your life,

06:08.493 --> 06:11.246
just as you have sworn to protect me.

06:11.330 --> 06:15.334
Maurice, I am a highly-trained
security professional,

06:15.416 --> 06:18.128
and I am not guarding a piece of fruit.

06:18.212 --> 06:20.005
[laughing]

06:20.088 --> 06:22.257
[groans]
You know the king.

06:22.341 --> 06:25.384
He'll get bored in a few days
and forget all about this.

06:25.468 --> 06:28.596
Just go along with it for now
so we can go back to bed.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.849
Uhh, fine. But to repay me,

06:30.932 --> 06:34.186
you'd better finally approve my request
to carry a flamethrower.

06:34.269 --> 06:35.645
Oy vey.

06:35.729 --> 06:39.274
King Julien, it will be my... honor

06:39.358 --> 06:43.111
to protect you and your... that.

06:43.195 --> 06:47.115
I will go and get started
on a fruit-based security apparatus.

06:47.199 --> 06:49.201
Or-- Or something. On it!

06:49.284 --> 06:53.454
Excellent. Now, it is time for the people
to meet the pineapple

06:53.538 --> 06:55.749
who will be deciding their fate.

06:57.376 --> 07:02.964
For years, your beloved king
has searched high and low for wisdom,

07:03.048 --> 07:06.134
for guidance in making
kingly decisions...

07:06.218 --> 07:09.930
and, at times,
for where he left his crown.

07:10.013 --> 07:11.514
Huh?

07:11.598 --> 07:15.102
That's a joke.
My crown is on my head. Duh!

07:15.185 --> 07:17.396
Ha ha ha ha! Uhh.

07:18.355 --> 07:19.606
Maurice.

07:19.689 --> 07:23.860
The king made a joke, people.
What do we do when we hear a joke?

07:24.903 --> 07:27.322
[all screaming]

07:27.406 --> 07:31.159
They'll get it eventually.
At least they stopped hurling bananas.

07:33.078 --> 07:35.247
I-- I-- I stand corrected.

07:35.330 --> 07:38.833
Anyways, I am proud to say

07:38.917 --> 07:41.586
my days of searching are over.

07:41.669 --> 07:44.756
Let's give it up
for my new kingly advisor...

07:44.839 --> 07:46.716
Piney!

07:46.800 --> 07:48.385
Feel free to "ooh" and "ahh".

07:48.468 --> 07:50.345
They passed "ooh" and "ahh"
training, right?

07:50.429 --> 07:54.808
"Oohs" and "ahhs", lemurs.
Let's sell it. This isn't a test.

07:54.891 --> 07:57.978
[all] Ooh! Ahh!

07:58.061 --> 08:02.732
Rejoice for me, for I have finally found
a worthy companion.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.944
[gasps]
Companion?

08:06.027 --> 08:09.239
You could even say we're soul mates!

08:09.323 --> 08:10.531
Soul mates?!

08:10.615 --> 08:13.076
[voice slowed down]
Soul mates!

08:13.160 --> 08:15.203
Ohh, this is heaven!

08:15.287 --> 08:18.957
Getting adored by Julien!
Oh-oh-oh, boy!

08:19.040 --> 08:21.542
It's better than you could
ever imagine, Mort!

08:21.626 --> 08:23.170
[growls]

08:23.253 --> 08:26.798
Oh, and he smells terrific.
And I don't even have a nose.

08:26.881 --> 08:28.925
That's how good he smells.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.470
You think I don't know
how good he smells?

08:31.552 --> 08:33.930
I've smelled him!
I smell him all the time!

08:34.014 --> 08:36.766
[Piney] Uh-oh, they appear
to be clapping for me.

08:36.850 --> 08:41.313
Oh, I'm blushing. Heh.
Bet they never do that for you, huh?

08:41.396 --> 08:42.730
[growls]

08:42.814 --> 08:44.107
[screaming]

08:45.566 --> 08:49.529
Maybe this will teach you some manners,
stupid talking pineapple!

08:49.612 --> 08:51.198
Maurice!

08:51.281 --> 08:53.492
[lemurs cheering]

08:53.574 --> 08:57.496
Heh heh. Julien loves you.
Stay positive.

08:58.538 --> 09:01.082
Good thoughts, good thoughts.

09:02.334 --> 09:05.295
Aaaaah!

09:05.379 --> 09:10.091
Ha ha ha ha!
Everyone loves us together.

09:10.175 --> 09:14.012
It's so amazing.
Oh, I never even liked pineapple before.

09:14.095 --> 09:16.264
[kissing]

09:16.348 --> 09:17.682
[door opens]

09:17.765 --> 09:21.269
What's going on? Duck and cover!
Let my body be your shield.

09:21.353 --> 09:23.604
Oh, King Julien. I'm sorry.

09:23.688 --> 09:26.149
I was just setting up your new,
uh, security system.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.527
You know, for... it.

09:28.609 --> 09:30.278
Ah, is it a good one?

09:30.362 --> 09:31.988
Oh, yeah, totally foolproof.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.574
I can't imagine anyone
will be able to get past this.

09:34.657 --> 09:37.285
Ooh. You don't think it's too good,
do you?

09:37.369 --> 09:40.247
Hey, all that matters
is that you and your soul mate

09:40.330 --> 09:42.374
are safe and sound, right?

09:42.457 --> 09:43.624
Good point, Clo.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.960
I don't know what I'd do
if something happened to him.

09:46.044 --> 09:49.256
Uh, yeah, that's great.

09:49.339 --> 09:51.091
Mm-hmm.

09:53.427 --> 09:57.597
If I snore too much,
just roll me on my side. Deal?

09:58.723 --> 10:00.808
[snoring]
Piney.

10:00.892 --> 10:02.143
Mmm.

10:02.227 --> 10:06.523
[snoring]
Mmm... Piney... mmm.

10:09.067 --> 10:11.194
[moans]

10:11.278 --> 10:12.779
[yawns]

10:12.862 --> 10:14.448
Good morning, my sweet.

10:14.531 --> 10:17.409
Did I feel someone trying
to spoon last--

10:17.492 --> 10:19.869
Aaaah!

10:19.953 --> 10:22.997
Aaaaah!

10:23.081 --> 10:26.793
Help! Someone, please help me!

10:26.876 --> 10:28.378
What's the situation?

10:28.462 --> 10:30.922
[sobbing]
Piney is gone!

10:31.005 --> 10:33.091
I-- I don't understand.

10:33.174 --> 10:35.969
I really didn't think anyone
would actually try to kidnap a...

10:36.052 --> 10:37.262
Piece of fruit?

10:37.345 --> 10:40.599
This is on me.
Don't worry, I will make it right.

10:40.681 --> 10:42.517
You have to find him.

10:42.601 --> 10:45.562
King Julien, finding things is what I do.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.940
I don't know who you are,
I don't know what you want.

10:49.023 --> 10:52.693
What I do know is that I have
a very particular set of skills,

10:52.777 --> 10:56.281
skills that make me a nightmare
for people like you.

10:57.365 --> 10:58.617
Who are you talking to?!

10:58.699 --> 11:02.162
No idea, Your Majesty.
Just sort of got in the-- in the groove.

11:02.245 --> 11:03.788
You know? Don't worry.

11:03.871 --> 11:06.416
You'll have your pineapple back
before you know it.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.709
This is probably all just
a big misunderstanding,

11:08.793 --> 11:12.213
and it's somewhere right now
completely safe and sound.

11:15.550 --> 11:18.470
What are we going to do with you?

11:18.553 --> 11:22.140
Not feeling so special now, are you?

11:23.099 --> 11:24.976
[crashing]

11:25.059 --> 11:26.394
I dusted your bed for evidence

11:26.478 --> 11:30.064
and found nothing but two leaves
and a small puddle of pineapple juice.

11:30.148 --> 11:33.818
[squeals] Pineapple juice?
My Piney has been injured!

11:33.901 --> 11:36.070
Please! You must find him!

11:36.154 --> 11:39.157
Someone could be blending him up
as we speak!

11:39.240 --> 11:42.243
Don't worry.
I did find something by the door

11:42.327 --> 11:45.746
on the back of my, uh...
theft-deterrent system.

11:45.830 --> 11:48.667
Footprints. Whoever did this
must've stepped on it on the way out.

11:48.749 --> 11:51.961
They're so tiny.
You don't think...

11:52.045 --> 11:56.090
That's right.
We're clearly looking for... a baby!

11:56.174 --> 11:59.636
And if I have to put the hurt
on every child lemur in this village

11:59.718 --> 12:02.597
to get your pineapple back, so be it!

12:02.681 --> 12:07.227
Good. Now, leave me.
I feel a serious whimpering coming on.

12:07.310 --> 12:08.478
[sobbing]

12:08.562 --> 12:10.063
Let's do this.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.482
[siren wailing]

12:31.543 --> 12:33.878
Uh, Clover?
Clover!

12:35.004 --> 12:36.548
You having one of those fantasies

12:36.631 --> 12:39.300
where you're a loose-cannon cop
who plays by her own rules?

12:39.384 --> 12:41.219
No. Yes.

12:41.302 --> 12:44.055
Stay out of my fantasies, Maurice!
I know what I'm doing.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.433
You gonna put up some fliers
and hope you get lucky?

12:46.516 --> 12:47.934
- Exactly.
- Ohh.

12:48.017 --> 12:53.690
I was finally getting close to the king,
and you had to ruin everything!

12:53.772 --> 12:55.774
What is your secret?

12:55.858 --> 12:58.777
How did you make him love you?!

12:58.861 --> 13:01.531
[Piney laughing]

13:01.615 --> 13:04.325
Stop laughing! Answer me!

13:04.409 --> 13:06.703
- [knocking]
- [gasps]

13:06.785 --> 13:08.121
Oh.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.914
Hello.

13:09.997 --> 13:13.334
Mort, I'm here because we've identified
the feet of the pineapple perp.

13:13.418 --> 13:16.170
[gasping]

13:16.254 --> 13:18.339
[thinking]
She knows. Take her out now!

13:18.423 --> 13:19.758
While you still have the chance!

13:19.840 --> 13:22.552
No, I can't. Clover is my friend.

13:22.636 --> 13:25.930
I say we bring this whole kingdom down,
take them all out!

13:26.013 --> 13:29.016
Who's that?
I thought we were alone in here.

13:29.100 --> 13:30.935
Uh, Mort, you okay?

13:31.018 --> 13:33.187
Uh... I...

13:33.271 --> 13:36.274
The feet, Mort. Hide the evidence!

13:39.444 --> 13:42.572
I, um-- Oh, wow.
That's just-- That's awful.

13:42.656 --> 13:46.618
I was just gonna ask you to hand out--
ahem-- some fliers, but--

13:47.661 --> 13:51.289
No, how about I just-- I'll leave some
outside the door for you.

13:52.332 --> 13:55.251
Oh. Oh, I see. Fliers.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.836
Sure, I'd be happy to help.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.213
Thanks, Mort, really appreciate it.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.048
I know how much you care
about King Julien,

14:01.132 --> 14:02.676
and his heart is really
broken right now.

14:02.759 --> 14:04.385
It is?

14:04.469 --> 14:05.886
Oh, yeah, big time.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.846
Whatever we may all
think about that pineapple,

14:07.930 --> 14:10.558
without it, King Julien is lost.

14:10.642 --> 14:11.892
Ohh.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.062
Julien, you have to eat.

14:15.146 --> 14:18.899
Uhh. Food has lost
all its appeal, Maurice.

14:18.983 --> 14:20.443
I'm so cold.

14:20.527 --> 14:21.986
It's 100 degrees out.

14:22.069 --> 14:23.613
Not in my soul.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.906
Come on. Yummy, yummy.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.451
Have a little bite. Just pick one.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.829
Is this fruit?

14:30.911 --> 14:35.875
You want me to eat a potential relative
of my dear Piney?

14:35.958 --> 14:41.756
I'm sorry, Maurice, but when did you
become an insensitive devil?!

14:41.840 --> 14:43.924
[sighs]

14:44.008 --> 14:45.677
- [snap]
- Hmm?

14:46.927 --> 14:49.430
- Where's Maurice?
- I haven't seen him.

14:49.514 --> 14:50.973
[Maurice] Yes, he has.

14:51.057 --> 14:54.268
So, you  did  install a security system
for the pineapple.

14:54.352 --> 14:57.731
No, this was something I installed
when King Julien was on that crash diet

14:57.814 --> 15:00.859
and wanted something to prevent him
from sneaking out for a midnight snack.

15:00.941 --> 15:03.319
You can't expect me
to be an effective ruler

15:03.403 --> 15:05.071
with cottage cheese thighs, can you?

15:05.154 --> 15:07.156
- [grunts]
- Hmm?

15:07.240 --> 15:10.660
Hmm. This panel
wasn't triggered last night

15:10.744 --> 15:12.704
when the pineapple perp struck.

15:12.787 --> 15:15.456
Maurice, bring me one of the fliers.

15:15.540 --> 15:19.919
He walked across this panel
but didn't set it off.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.921
It didn't take much for me to set it off.

15:22.004 --> 15:24.382
Whoever this thief is,
he'd have to be pretty light.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.967
And he'd have to know
how much losing the pineapple

15:27.051 --> 15:28.553
would hurt King Julien.

15:28.636 --> 15:31.806
Who do we know that has tiny feet,
doesn't weigh much

15:31.890 --> 15:35.518
and would be jealous of King Julien's
affections for a piece of fruit?

15:35.602 --> 15:37.228
This is going nowhere.

15:37.311 --> 15:41.482
I need something sad and pathetic
to put my life into perspective.

15:41.566 --> 15:42.942
Where's Mort?

15:43.025 --> 15:44.444
[both]
Mort!

15:44.527 --> 15:48.782
Oh, what have I done?
I never wanted to hurt King Julien.

15:48.865 --> 15:50.867
I love King Julien.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.953
[growls]
This is all your fault.

15:54.995 --> 15:57.874
I should destroy you right now!

15:57.957 --> 15:59.459
But I can't.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.419
He has chosen you.

16:01.502 --> 16:05.715
I am the one
who should be destroyed!

16:05.799 --> 16:08.259
- [knock on door]
- Huh? Huh?

16:10.887 --> 16:12.722
It's too late! They found me!

16:12.806 --> 16:16.183
If Julien sees me with his pineapple,
he'll never forgive me.

16:16.267 --> 16:18.144
[grunting]

16:18.227 --> 16:19.312
[knocking continues]

16:19.395 --> 16:21.522
Uhh! Ohh!

16:21.606 --> 16:24.191
[Julien]
Piney! Are you all right?

16:24.275 --> 16:26.486
What has that demented
jungle wart done to you?

16:26.569 --> 16:28.988
Hyah! Looks like its crown is shedding.

16:29.071 --> 16:30.657
There's more leading out the back.

16:30.740 --> 16:33.367
Oh, what am I going to do?

16:33.451 --> 16:38.581
Wait. Maybe I could return you
before they get back to the baobab tree.

16:38.665 --> 16:42.502
Of course!
Why didn't I think of it before?

16:42.585 --> 16:44.378
- Because you have no brain.
- [growls]

16:44.462 --> 16:47.924
That's why Julien will always love me
and not you.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.092
He loves my juicy brain.

16:50.176 --> 16:52.804
Juicy, juicy, juicy! Ha ha ha ha!

16:52.887 --> 16:55.097
My brain is plenty juicy!

16:55.181 --> 16:57.976
And Julien will love it again
as soon as I--

16:58.058 --> 17:01.938
Heh heh heh. Foosa hungry.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.607
Foosa lunchtime!

17:04.691 --> 17:08.277
Uh, ha ha.
Could you guys wait here?

17:08.361 --> 17:10.571
I have to run a quick errand.

17:10.655 --> 17:14.116
Trust me, these haunches
will be worth it.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.201
[snarls]

17:15.284 --> 17:17.411
- Whoa!
- [roaring]

17:17.495 --> 17:19.163
Oh, my gosh!

17:21.499 --> 17:23.250
Whee!

17:23.334 --> 17:24.544
Whee!

17:25.503 --> 17:27.087
[roaring]

17:29.423 --> 17:30.967
[Mort shouting]

17:34.512 --> 17:37.306
Hmm. It looks like he's
headed this way.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.017
[Julien]
Can't we go any faster?

17:39.099 --> 17:41.185
We could if I didn't have to carry you.

17:41.268 --> 17:42.436
Oh, you love it.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.647
Remember when we were young
and you'd give me pony rides?

17:44.731 --> 17:45.899
That never happened.

17:45.982 --> 17:48.359
I'd call you Pringle and feed you sugar.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.570
You're thinking of a real pony,
King Julien.

17:50.653 --> 17:52.112
No, I'm pretty sure it was you.

17:52.196 --> 17:54.699
- [Mort shouting]
- That came from the mountain.

17:54.782 --> 17:57.493
- Aah!
- I know a shortcut.

17:57.577 --> 18:00.413
What are we waiting for? Faster, Pringle!

18:00.496 --> 18:02.122
[grunting]

18:04.083 --> 18:06.753
[panting]

18:06.836 --> 18:09.422
[Julien]
Unhand that pineapple, Mort!

18:09.505 --> 18:13.175
Just put it down and I'll order Clover
to make your punishment painless.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.929
Nice and old-fashioned, no party favors.

18:16.012 --> 18:17.931
- I don't know what that means.
- He doesn't either.

18:18.014 --> 18:19.807
I'm so sorry, my king.

18:19.891 --> 18:23.770
I swear I was about to return it,
but the foosa was on my tail.

18:23.853 --> 18:25.897
- Did you say foosa?
- He's bluffing.

18:25.980 --> 18:28.190
- [snarling]
- Or not.

18:29.943 --> 18:32.570
We're caught between the foosa
and a really bad spot.

18:34.030 --> 18:37.157
Those are active land mines down there,
Your Majesty.

18:37.241 --> 18:38.409
[snarling]

18:38.492 --> 18:40.036
[rumbling]

18:40.119 --> 18:44.749
Do you hear that? It's the gods!
They're coming help me and Piney!

18:44.832 --> 18:45.833
What about us?

18:45.917 --> 18:49.128
Don't be greedy, Maurice.
There's only so much god to go around.

18:49.211 --> 18:51.631
Give it to me, baby!

18:51.714 --> 18:53.841
[whining]

18:55.593 --> 18:57.011
Huh?

18:57.095 --> 18:58.554
[roaring]

18:59.597 --> 19:01.390
[shrieking]

19:01.474 --> 19:03.851
See? I told you the gods were good.

19:03.935 --> 19:05.645
[voice slowed down]
Ohhhh!

19:05.728 --> 19:07.396
[gasps]

19:08.731 --> 19:12.026
No-o-o-o!

19:13.820 --> 19:18.950
Fee-ee-ee-eet!

19:21.035 --> 19:25.498
Uhh! Oh, Maurice! I can't hold you!

19:25.581 --> 19:26.958
And I can't hold Mort!

19:27.041 --> 19:29.836
And I-- Feet!

19:29.919 --> 19:32.046
King Julien, let the pineapple go

19:32.130 --> 19:34.632
and give us your hand
so we can pull you up.

19:34.715 --> 19:37.301
If you fall,
you'll be blown to smithereens!

19:37.384 --> 19:41.722
Never! I will not sacrifice
the souls of my ancestors!

19:41.806 --> 19:44.475
King Julien, I'm done
playing along with this.

19:44.558 --> 19:46.936
There are no souls in there.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.813
At this time, I'd bet my life on it.

19:48.896 --> 19:50.731
Pinky swear, cross my heart
and hope to die.

19:50.815 --> 19:52.274
I didn't hear you say,
"No backsies."

19:52.358 --> 19:57.488
Listen to me. You don't need
a pineapple to make your decisions.

19:57.571 --> 20:01.701
You have all the answers inside yourself,
no matter how stupid that sounds.

20:01.784 --> 20:06.539
He's right, Your Majesty.
Deep down, you know exactly what to do.

20:06.622 --> 20:10.626
You're right. I do know
the decision I must make.

20:10.710 --> 20:15.339
I must sacrifice myself
to save the pineapple!

20:15.422 --> 20:19.802
- [all] What?!
- No-o-o-o!

20:25.307 --> 20:27.267
Hmm? Where--

20:27.351 --> 20:29.311
Where am I?

20:29.395 --> 20:30.771
Am I dead?

20:30.855 --> 20:35.401
That's up to you, Julien.
Are you sure it's your time to go?

20:35.484 --> 20:37.111
I don't know.

20:38.487 --> 20:39.864
If I choose to go back,

20:39.947 --> 20:43.201
will I still have your wisdom
to make the right decision?

20:43.283 --> 20:47.914
The question is, Julien,
do you really need my wisdom?

20:47.997 --> 20:52.668
Um, answering a question with a question
is really annoying, you know that, right?

20:52.752 --> 20:56.839
Fine. You already have the wisdom.
That's how you got here.

20:56.923 --> 21:00.009
You made a decision on your own.

21:00.093 --> 21:04.471
So, if I do stay, what's death like?

21:04.555 --> 21:05.932
Is there dancing?

21:06.015 --> 21:08.308
Only on Sundays, after Bingo.

21:08.392 --> 21:10.728
What'd you say, what?
Only one day of dancing?

21:10.811 --> 21:13.773
What kind of third-world bughouse
are you running here, pineapple?

21:13.856 --> 21:16.358
No, no way, I cannot stay here.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.444
So you've made your decision?

21:18.527 --> 21:20.988
Yeah, you bet
your prickly badonkadonk I have.

21:21.072 --> 21:23.282
I'm going home, baby.

21:23.365 --> 21:26.119
Whew. I thought he'd never leave.

21:26.202 --> 21:27.954
[Julien]
I heard that.

21:29.997 --> 21:32.792
He looks so peaceful.

21:32.875 --> 21:34.710
I can have his body, right?

21:34.794 --> 21:36.254
[snoring]

21:36.336 --> 21:38.923
[babbles, coughs]

21:39.006 --> 21:40.967
King Julien, you're okay?

21:41.050 --> 21:43.594
Ah! Ha ha ha! Yes.

21:43.677 --> 21:47.098
Because I chose life, Maurice. Life!

21:47.181 --> 21:49.809
I chose making decisions for myself

21:49.892 --> 21:53.020
and dancing on all days,
not just Sundays.

21:53.104 --> 21:55.273
I love you, King Julien!

21:55.355 --> 21:58.234
Can we please go back
to the way things were?

21:58.317 --> 22:00.694
Of course, Mort.

22:00.778 --> 22:03.530
Thank you, King Julien!
I'm so happy!

22:03.614 --> 22:04.782
[boom]

22:04.865 --> 22:07.409
King Julien, I promise that,
from this day forth,

22:07.493 --> 22:09.996
your pineapple
will never leave my sight.

22:10.079 --> 22:13.833
Actually, this new
decision-making king of yours
