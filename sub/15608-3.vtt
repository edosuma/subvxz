(GRUNTING)

11:47.087 --> 11:50.000
Uh, guys?
I didn't quite make it.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.591
Uh, yeah, we see that.

11:52.883 --> 11:54.965
If we had to get stuck
with half of Jorge,

11:54.965 --> 11:57.717
why did it have to be
this half?

11:57.717 --> 11:59.549
Oh, cruel world.

12:01.641 --> 12:04.644
Sheila! Here, girl!

12:04.644 --> 12:08.018
We need some kind of bait.
Should we say we have pizza?

12:08.018 --> 12:10.771
Sure, Emma.
Should it be thin crust
or deep dish?

12:10.771 --> 12:12.312
Well, if the sheep
is from Chicago...

12:12.312 --> 12:13.944
I was being sarcastic!

12:16.026 --> 12:18.568
I'm sorry,
I'm just worried
about Sheila.

12:18.568 --> 12:20.821
I know,
but we'll find her.

12:20.821 --> 12:23.453
Sheila!
We have pizza!

12:23.453 --> 12:25.665
(SHEILA BLEATING)
She's over there!

12:25.665 --> 12:27.868
Ah, told you.
Pizza always works.

12:31.001 --> 12:33.003
Sheila! I was so worried
about you,

12:33.003 --> 12:34.875
I snapped at Emma.

12:34.875 --> 12:36.676
Zuri, you snap at me
all the time.

12:36.676 --> 12:39.469
Yeah, but this time,
I was sorry about it.

12:39.469 --> 12:43.183
Man, having a kid
makes you soft.

12:43.183 --> 12:44.935
Okay, sheep mama,
let's go.

12:45.685 --> 12:47.767
(BLEATS)

12:47.767 --> 12:49.940
Something's wrong
with Sheila.

12:49.940 --> 12:52.062
Do you think she got into
the mess hall food?

12:52.062 --> 12:53.563
I hope not.

12:53.563 --> 12:54.895
(WHISPERS) They were serving
lamb chops.

12:56.156 --> 12:57.948
(BLEATS)

12:57.948 --> 13:00.030
She seems like
she's in pain.

13:00.030 --> 13:02.612
Look, I don't care if
we get in trouble with Lou,

13:02.612 --> 13:04.784
we need to find Sheila help.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.407
You're right.
Let's get her back to camp.

13:07.407 --> 13:10.410
Uh, one question.
Which way is camp?

13:10.410 --> 13:13.753
Uh... It's around here
somewhere.

13:13.753 --> 13:15.675
I remember passing
some trees.

13:15.675 --> 13:16.877
And I know for sure
it's in Maine.

13:18.338 --> 13:21.471
Great, now I feel
so much better.

13:21.471 --> 13:23.383
Don't worry,
I'll find it.

13:23.383 --> 13:25.976
How? You get lost
at the mall.

13:25.976 --> 13:28.688
Between you and me,
I do that on purpose,
so I can keep shopping.

13:29.189 --> 13:30.190
(BLEATS)

13:34.024 --> 13:35.435
(BLEATS)

13:35.435 --> 13:37.567
Sheila's getting worse!

13:37.567 --> 13:40.070
I should've taken
better care of her.

13:41.571 --> 13:43.443
Zuri, listen...

13:43.443 --> 13:46.496
You know how you love Sheila
and want to take care of her?

13:46.496 --> 13:48.869
Well, that's how I feel
about you.

13:48.869 --> 13:51.541
So I promise,
I'll get us back to camp.

13:51.541 --> 13:54.294
But it's dark!
What if we get more lost?

13:55.545 --> 13:57.667
Oh, do you have
your phone?

13:57.667 --> 14:01.511
Yeah, but this hardly seems
like the time to post
a status update.

14:01.511 --> 14:03.673
No, your phone
has a flashlight on it.

14:03.673 --> 14:05.305
But now that
you mention it...

14:08.268 --> 14:09.429
(CLICKS CAMERA)

14:11.101 --> 14:13.523
Hashtag, lost and fabulous.

14:13.523 --> 14:15.185
Emma, focus!

14:15.185 --> 14:19.239
Sorry. I am a selfie addict.

14:20.981 --> 14:23.073
But the point is,
we can use your flashlight
on your phone

14:23.073 --> 14:25.115
to retrace our footprints
back to camp.

14:25.115 --> 14:26.866
Great idea!

14:26.866 --> 14:28.448
(CLICKS CAMERA)

14:28.448 --> 14:30.160
Hashtag, great idea!

14:30.160 --> 14:31.661
Emma!

14:31.661 --> 14:33.293
I said I have a problem!

14:34.834 --> 14:36.166
Help!

14:36.166 --> 14:38.758
Jorge, your screaming
is helping no one.

14:38.758 --> 14:42.262
You are merely sending out
a "come eat me" signal
to the bears.

14:42.262 --> 14:43.503
Just let him scream.

14:43.503 --> 14:45.095
If they chew off
his top half,

14:45.095 --> 14:46.266
maybe we can get
the rest out.

14:47.217 --> 14:49.639
(GRUNTS) Are you using
all your strength?

14:49.639 --> 14:52.182
Are you using
any strength?

14:53.183 --> 14:54.394
Ow!

14:54.394 --> 14:56.106
Oh, sorry, Jorge.

14:56.106 --> 14:58.648
Did the force of
my raging biceps
hurt you?

15:00.650 --> 15:05.235
No, a bird is making
a nest on my head!

15:05.235 --> 15:09.489
It's turning my cranium
into a condo!

15:09.489 --> 15:12.082
Okay, pulling isn't working.

15:12.082 --> 15:13.163
We're going to
have to push him out.

15:13.163 --> 15:14.834
(SIGHS) Good idea.

15:16.706 --> 15:18.458
Go for it, man.
(CHUCKLES)

15:18.458 --> 15:20.630
No, after you. I insist.

15:20.630 --> 15:22.172
But you've known him longer.

15:22.172 --> 15:24.174
Which is why
I cannot go near that.

15:25.635 --> 15:29.809
Quit arguing
and just push my tush!

15:29.809 --> 15:31.551
It is so hot,
my eyes are sweating!

15:31.551 --> 15:34.224
Yeah, that's called crying!

15:34.224 --> 15:37.397
Wait! My boiled brain
just had a thought.

15:37.397 --> 15:40.230
Maybe the heat will make
Jorge perspire more.

15:40.230 --> 15:44.024
The sweatier he is,
the easier it will be to
slip him out of the hole.

15:44.024 --> 15:45.325
Jorge can get sweatier?

15:45.325 --> 15:46.526
He can always
get sweatier.

15:50.570 --> 15:52.282
We made it!
We're safe!

her own language.

16:04.174 --> 16:06.256

you lazy yahoos

16:06.256 --> 16:08.138
think you can just
dosey-doh out of barn duty,

16:08.138 --> 16:09.509
and take Sheila
for a night trot!

but right now we need
your help!

After that,
you can yell at us
in your country gibberish.

we weren't paying attention,
and now she's sick.

are you in?

Sheila had a little lamb!

today, we stared death
right in the face.

was Jorge's butt.

was more revolting
than public transportation.

for letting you guys
down yesterday

21:51.771 --> 21:53.062
Thank you.

21:53.062 --> 21:54.604
Well, Woodchucks,
I have to say

21:54.604 --> 21:56.486
your barn duty started out...

21:56.486 --> 21:58.147
Well, like doody,

21:58.147 --> 21:59.489
but you really
turned it around.

21:59.489 --> 22:00.780
I salute you.

22:00.780 --> 22:02.572
(ALL CHITTERING)

22:02.572 --> 22:03.703
And I have news.

22:03.703 --> 22:05.745
Next week,
we're on plumbing duty.

22:05.745 --> 22:07.707
Sadly, the septic tank
hasn't been pumped

22:07.707 --> 22:09.869
since the '80s,
and it is stinky!

22:12.542 --> 22:14.043
(THUDS)

22:14.043 --> 22:16.165
We should tie a pillow
to the back of her head.
