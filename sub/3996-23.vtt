Hey, Jess.

00:10.341 --> 00:11.608
I brought you
some tea.

00:11.676 --> 00:13.877
Just gonna leave it
right here, okay?

00:13.945 --> 00:15.079
There you go.

00:15.146 --> 00:16.847
So, Russell...

00:17.415 --> 00:18.148
Ouch.

00:18.216 --> 00:19.683
Right? I mean, who
saw that coming?

00:19.751 --> 00:21.218
Not me.

00:21.285 --> 00:23.652
Certainly not Russell.

00:23.721 --> 00:25.454
I guess, I guess
you saw it coming.

00:25.522 --> 00:27.223
I mean, 'cause you're
the one who broke up with him.

00:27.290 --> 00:28.557
- Leave, Schmidt.
- All right, fine.

00:28.625 --> 00:29.726
I'll leave. But
you know what?

00:29.793 --> 00:31.194
Know this: you're not

00:31.261 --> 00:32.360
the only one
that's hurting here,

00:32.429 --> 00:34.230
Jessica Day.
The economy stinks,

00:34.297 --> 00:36.599
bees are dying, movies are
pretty much all sequels now,

00:36.666 --> 00:37.633
and I...

00:37.701 --> 00:39.201
Don't say "broken penis."

00:39.268 --> 00:40.335
...have a broken penis.

00:40.402 --> 00:43.205
Don't pretend to know my pain.

00:43.272 --> 00:44.940
(song continues)

00:45.507 --> 00:46.775
Hey, Jess.

00:46.843 --> 00:48.877
- Hi.
- What's this song called?

00:48.945 --> 00:50.445
- "The River."
- Hmm.

00:50.512 --> 00:52.114
- Do you like it?
- Yeah, yeah, I liked the way

00:52.181 --> 00:54.381
you played it for the first time
at 10:00 last night.

00:54.449 --> 00:56.650
I liked it a little bit less
at 2:00 a.m.

00:56.718 --> 00:57.885
And now I'm kind
of hoping that

00:57.953 --> 00:59.553
the sun comes up,
thaws that river

00:59.621 --> 01:00.755
and that woman drowns.

01:00.822 --> 01:02.522
Get out!

01:04.226 --> 01:06.060
(song continues)

01:09.030 --> 01:10.396
Russell was perfect.

01:10.464 --> 01:11.831
What's wrong with me?

01:11.899 --> 01:13.066
Am I self-sabotaging?

01:13.134 --> 01:14.734
Am I secretly a Cylon?

01:14.802 --> 01:16.502
You just didn't love him.

01:16.570 --> 01:18.004
But what if it's me?

01:18.072 --> 01:20.339
What if I have some idea
of love in my head

01:20.407 --> 01:22.008
and it's just totally wrong?

01:22.076 --> 01:23.743
Do not second-guess
yourself, okay?

01:23.811 --> 01:27.246
It was a tough choice,
but it was the right choice.

01:27.613 --> 01:29.114
Yeah, mm-hmm.

01:30.082 --> 01:32.584
So what do you think
about turning off that song?

01:32.652 --> 01:33.986
- I just feel like I should...
- Off. Turn it off.

01:37.189 --> 01:37.855

Caroline and I made up
a dance routine to cheer you up.

01:55.540 --> 01:57.275
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah, well, I'm gonna dance,

01:57.342 --> 01:58.474

- Okay. I'll just clap.

you're never gonna be old,

because humans--
we're gonna be immortal by 2026.

02:27.603 --> 02:29.138

give me your phone.

02:29.206 --> 02:30.138

02:30.206 --> 02:31.840
Do you want to drunkenly call

02:31.907 --> 02:34.008
Russell tonight and tell him
what a huge mistake you made?

02:34.076 --> 02:36.010
- You don't want to backslide, trust me.
- Be quiet.

too perfect to talk to

anyone in Jess's condition

what happens
after a clean break.

02:42.484 --> 02:45.086
When you, when you freak out
and you go crawling back

02:45.154 --> 02:47.487
and you just make everything
messy and horrible.

02:47.555 --> 02:49.056
- I'm not gonna do that.
- You have backslider

02:49.123 --> 02:50.958
written all over you.

02:51.025 --> 02:52.592
Did I tell you
guys that my boss

02:52.660 --> 02:54.427
invited me to play poker
with him tonight?

02:54.495 --> 02:56.363
Crazy thing, he never invites
anybody to play poker with him.

02:56.430 --> 02:58.465
I mean, come on, I'm in
the prime of my life, baby.

02:58.532 --> 02:59.699
- Winston, shut up!
- Shut up!

02:59.767 --> 03:00.834
JESS:
Schmidt, I actually

03:00.902 --> 03:01.868
- need my phone back.
- No.

03:01.935 --> 03:03.336
I need to call Russell to just

03:03.403 --> 03:04.703
tell him I left
my pajamas there.

03:04.771 --> 03:06.405
The fact that you were
wearing pajamas

03:06.473 --> 03:08.407
in the presence of your lover
tells me that that relationship

03:08.475 --> 03:09.675
was doomed from the start.
No way.

03:09.743 --> 03:10.977
Disgusting.

- What can I get you?

03:17.717 --> 03:19.617
How about one of those
Nick Miller Manhattans?

03:19.685 --> 03:21.486
Ah, straight bourbon
in a plastic cup.

03:21.553 --> 03:22.520
(chuckles)

03:22.588 --> 03:24.322
Come with me.

03:26.558 --> 03:27.625
Think we should
show him the DVD?

03:27.693 --> 03:29.761
What DVD?

03:29.828 --> 03:33.265
Nick made a DVD after the last
time Caroline broke up with him.

03:33.332 --> 03:35.432
It's all the reasons why they
shouldn't get back together.

03:35.500 --> 03:36.666
We hid it somewhere in the loft.

03:36.734 --> 03:38.535
Ooh. Intrigue.

03:38.603 --> 03:40.771
- Mama like.
- I don't know that we should...

03:40.838 --> 03:42.873
Cece's here.

03:42.941 --> 03:44.541
Why is she dressed like
a women's studies major?

03:44.609 --> 03:45.776
SCHMIDT:
It's precautionary.

03:45.843 --> 03:46.977

junk heals.

03:47.045 --> 03:48.578
Ow. Owie.

03:48.646 --> 03:49.646
Damn it.

03:49.714 --> 03:50.613
You okay?

03:50.680 --> 03:51.747
No, I'm not okay.

03:51.815 --> 03:53.449
What is going on, Jess?

03:53.517 --> 03:55.218
I was just thinking
about this word

03:55.286 --> 03:57.420
that I learned from Schmidt.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.088
Backsliding.

03:59.156 --> 04:00.990
Oh, so you're saying
I'm a backslider.

04:01.058 --> 04:02.658
I don't know what we're supposed
to do together any more.

04:02.726 --> 04:04.894
Everything seems
to turn you on.

04:04.962 --> 04:07.729
Oh, look, Cece, a bird.
Ow. Ah, damn it!

04:07.797 --> 04:10.799
Schmidt, it's a mother bird
in her nest!

04:10.866 --> 04:12.167
Must I say it, Cece?

04:12.235 --> 04:13.335
What?

04:13.403 --> 04:14.702
- Eggs.
- Okay.

04:16.704 --> 04:18.473
Okay, sure, look, did Caroline

04:18.541 --> 04:22.243
physically, mentally and
emotionally abuse me for years?

04:22.611 --> 04:23.644
Yes!

04:24.211 --> 04:25.679
But she changed.

04:25.747 --> 04:27.548
It's about timing.

04:27.615 --> 04:29.951
And the first time around,
we weren't ready to work at it,

04:30.018 --> 04:31.419
and now we are.

04:31.486 --> 04:32.519
And besides,

04:32.587 --> 04:34.488
Caroline is way hotter than

04:34.556 --> 04:37.724
that voice in my head,
who sounds like Tom Waits

04:37.792 --> 04:40.526
and tells me I'm a failure
and that I look bad in hats.

04:40.594 --> 04:42.628
I don't want to spend
my whole life with him.

04:42.696 --> 04:44.297
You know what I mean?

04:44.365 --> 04:46.066
Okay.

04:46.133 --> 04:47.867
At least you'll get
a break from me tomorrow.

04:47.935 --> 04:49.336
I've got to go visit my <i>dadi.</i>

04:49.403 --> 04:50.236
What?

04:50.304 --> 04:51.637
It's my grandmother.

04:51.705 --> 04:53.139
- Oh, your <i>bubbe?</i>
- Yes, my...

04:53.207 --> 04:54.906
Oh, I have a <i>bubbe.</i>

04:54.975 --> 04:56.775
- Uh, my <i>bubbe</i> is in a home.
- Yeah.

04:56.843 --> 04:58.344
Old people
freak me out.

04:58.411 --> 05:01.113
With their hands
and their legs.

05:01.181 --> 05:04.083
Just, they're like the human
version of pleated pants.

05:04.650 --> 05:05.817
- Really?
- Not for me.

05:05.885 --> 05:06.818
- Hey, Schmidt.
- Hey.

05:06.886 --> 05:07.686
Can I borrow
your jacket?

05:07.753 --> 05:08.854
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

05:08.921 --> 05:10.421
CECE:
Like, aren't into old people?

05:10.489 --> 05:11.522
SCHMIDT:
Not at all.

05:11.590 --> 05:12.991
I mean, just-just horr...

05:13.058 --> 05:14.359
like giant
walking raisins.

05:14.426 --> 05:15.326
They're in a home...

05:15.394 --> 05:17.328
It's me.

05:17.396 --> 05:19.697
I've been thinking
a lot about you.

05:19.764 --> 05:20.598
(whispers):
Jess.

05:20.665 --> 05:21.899
Hmm?

05:21.967 --> 05:25.003
I can't feel my arm.

05:25.070 --> 05:27.270
(sighs)

05:27.338 --> 05:28.905
Oh.

05:28.973 --> 05:30.673
Whoa.

05:30.741 --> 05:33.010
I really can't
feel it at all.

05:33.077 --> 05:34.344
Wake up, fella.

05:34.412 --> 05:36.446
You're gonna be late for school.

05:36.514 --> 05:38.081
(sighs)

05:38.149 --> 05:39.449
Genzlinger.

05:41.025 --> 05:42.457
(sighs)

05:42.524 --> 05:44.792
What is that?

05:45.360 --> 05:46.727
It's an earring, man.
What does it look like?

05:47.195 --> 05:48.596
Got kind of wasted
last night with Joe,

05:48.664 --> 05:50.098
and so, you know,
I got my ear pierced.

05:50.916 --> 05:52.999
This is the perfect moment.
(giggling)

05:53.967 --> 05:55.668
Wait, I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it.

05:55.736 --> 05:56.670
- Wait, what?
- I'm gonna do.

05:56.737 --> 05:58.572
See, this is when
it gets weird between us.

05:58.606 --> 05:59.439
One, two, three.

05:59.507 --> 06:00.740
(grunts)
(screams)

06:00.808 --> 06:02.208
You know,
traditionally, the male

06:02.276 --> 06:03.376
of the species is
more glamorous.

06:03.944 --> 06:05.579
When's it coming out,
by the way?

06:05.646 --> 06:08.181
- The earring? - No, no, the smooth
jazz album you're dropping.

06:10.551 --> 06:13.887
Hey, guys. You
remember, um, Paul.

06:13.955 --> 06:15.521
Mercedes-Genz!

06:15.555 --> 06:17.055
WINSTON:
Genzel Washington.

06:17.156 --> 06:19.658
It's the Genz of the world
as we know it.

06:19.726 --> 06:22.427
All right, everybody, put down
your Genz and your Genzils.

06:22.529 --> 06:23.896
Hey, Schmidt.
What's up, Washington?

06:25.365 --> 06:26.799
- Um hey.
- Hey.

06:26.867 --> 06:28.567
- So maybe--
- Okay.

06:28.635 --> 06:30.402
- We definitely--
- Oh yeah, that sounds...

06:30.503 --> 06:32.470
Okay.

06:32.505 --> 06:33.538
Okay.

06:33.606 --> 06:35.339
- Okay
- All right.

06:37.576 --> 06:38.877
- Backslider!
- Don't.

06:38.944 --> 06:39.911
- You backslid.
- Come on.

06:39.979 --> 06:41.980
You backslid all the way

06:42.047 --> 06:44.516
down the hill and back
into the parking lot.

06:44.583 --> 06:46.183
Take off your skis and wait

06:46.251 --> 06:48.084
for your family in the lodge,
Jessica Day.

06:48.152 --> 06:49.653
Look, I think
this could be good.

06:49.721 --> 06:51.855
Paul and I had
really bad timing before,

06:51.923 --> 06:54.357
and maybe I should just
give it another shot.

06:54.425 --> 06:55.492
Such an ugly crier.

06:55.560 --> 06:57.293
He is the all-time worst crier.

06:57.361 --> 06:59.429
(sobbing)

07:05.502 --> 07:07.837
It's like
he's a slow-motion sneeze.

07:07.905 --> 07:08.838
Winston,

07:08.906 --> 07:10.139
what is in your ear?

07:10.206 --> 07:11.040
It's hot and
I love it.

07:11.107 --> 07:12.909
Does that feed information

07:12.976 --> 07:14.610
back to Shelby to keep track
of your migration patterns?

07:14.678 --> 07:15.578
- Drop it.
- Please, Jess.

07:15.646 --> 07:16.979
He just got back from Carnival.

07:17.047 --> 07:18.213
Know what?

07:20.550 --> 07:22.450
(whispers): These
people are disgusting.

07:22.518 --> 07:24.019
I've never been more
flaccid in my life.

07:24.086 --> 07:24.986
(laughs)

07:25.054 --> 07:25.987
Thank God.

07:26.055 --> 07:27.656
I mean, this place

07:27.723 --> 07:29.390
is a cardigan gold mine.

07:29.458 --> 07:30.391
Can I get you
anything, Dadi?

07:30.459 --> 07:32.427
A hot-blooded man

07:32.494 --> 07:34.262
and a hotel room
would be nice.

07:35.396 --> 07:37.031
Oh, just get me a puzzle.

07:39.267 --> 07:40.534
Yeah?

07:40.602 --> 07:42.302
I raised that girl.

07:42.370 --> 07:44.404
She is my life.

07:44.472 --> 07:46.373
And she's not
as tough as she looks.

07:46.441 --> 07:48.842
If you hurt her,

07:48.910 --> 07:52.411
I will let myself die
and then I will haunt you.

07:53.981 --> 07:55.214
Whoa, look at
this fireplace.

07:55.282 --> 07:56.950
It's huge.

07:57.017 --> 07:59.052
Caroline, that is not a
fireplace, that is, like,

07:59.119 --> 08:01.187
a room you could
safely set on fire.

08:01.254 --> 08:02.221
(chuckles)

08:02.289 --> 08:03.656
Yeah, this is really nice.

08:03.724 --> 08:05.524
- It is.
- So grown up.

08:05.593 --> 08:07.125
But where's all your stuff
gonna go?

08:07.193 --> 08:10.361
Like, where will
the Grateful Dead bears dance?

08:10.429 --> 08:12.064
Oh, I didn't realize
I lived here, too.

08:12.131 --> 08:14.666
Seriously though, what do
you think about moving in?

08:14.734 --> 08:16.802
Wait, you want to
move in together?

08:16.869 --> 08:19.537
Yeah, I mean, I feel like
if we're gonna do this again,

08:19.606 --> 08:21.372
we should do it
for real this time, you know?

08:21.440 --> 08:22.340
Right.

08:22.408 --> 08:24.374
I mean, I'm 33 years old.

08:24.442 --> 08:26.443
You're 30 years old; we're the
same age, you knucklehead.

08:26.511 --> 08:29.780
No, I lied about that.
I'm 33.

08:29.848 --> 08:31.849
I don't want to start
at the beginning again with you.

08:31.917 --> 08:37.922
I mean, you're not...
not making sense.

08:37.990 --> 08:39.089
(school bell ringing, knocking)

08:39.155 --> 08:40.188
Knock-knock.

08:40.256 --> 08:41.190
Hi.

08:41.258 --> 08:42.692
Hi back.

08:42.760 --> 08:44.293
- Um...
- Hey...

08:44.361 --> 08:45.962
- I want to tell you...
- I have something to tell you.

08:46.030 --> 08:47.396
- Oh, sorry, you go first.
- Oh, I'll go first.

08:47.464 --> 08:52.068
Um, I was thinking
a lot about, um...

08:52.136 --> 08:54.870
you and last night.

08:54.938 --> 08:57.072
Right.

08:57.140 --> 08:59.608
And we have
something good.

08:59.676 --> 09:02.511
Jess, I have a girlfriend.

09:02.578 --> 09:04.046
- What?
- Yeah.

09:04.114 --> 09:06.615
Very serious girlfriend.

09:06.683 --> 09:07.716
Oh, my God.

09:07.784 --> 09:09.351
Why didn't you tell me?

09:09.418 --> 09:11.686
(sighs) When you called me
last night, we had just gotten

09:11.754 --> 09:14.221
into this huge fight,
and I was really confused.

09:14.289 --> 09:16.190
You cheating on
her with me?

09:16.258 --> 09:17.558
Is that bad?
That's bad.

09:17.626 --> 09:18.926
It's really bad.

09:18.994 --> 09:21.095
Oh, no, that's really bad.

09:21.163 --> 09:23.064
Why would you
do that?!

09:23.132 --> 09:24.598
Now I know what Bill Clinton
feels like.

09:24.667 --> 09:26.767
Now I know
how Monica Lewinsky feels!

09:26.834 --> 09:28.902
I'm sorry I made you
feel like Monica Lewinsky.

09:28.970 --> 09:29.670
Stop crying!

09:29.737 --> 09:31.437
You are literally

09:31.505 --> 09:33.506
the ugliest crier
I have ever seen!

09:33.574 --> 09:35.642
You cry smile.

09:35.710 --> 09:36.943
Hey, babe, I'm here for lunch.

09:37.011 --> 09:38.645
- Oh!
- Oh.

09:38.713 --> 09:40.280
Oh, no, are
you crying?

09:40.347 --> 09:43.282
Is everything okay?

09:43.349 --> 09:46.251
There's-there's...

09:46.319 --> 09:48.453
I'm sorry to have to
break it to you,

09:48.521 --> 09:49.922
but that is the way

09:49.990 --> 09:51.791
the electoral college works,
man.

09:51.858 --> 09:54.493
It-it seems so unfair.

09:54.561 --> 09:56.528
So votes don't mean as much.

09:56.596 --> 09:57.429
It upsets me, too.

10:01.696 --> 10:02.931
(video game music playing)

10:02.996 --> 10:04.031
I'm gonna miss you, Winston.

10:04.349 --> 10:05.733
- What do you mean?
- I'm gonna miss you

10:05.800 --> 10:07.701
when your caravan moves on
to the next village.

10:07.769 --> 10:09.170
(door opens, closes)

10:09.238 --> 10:10.704
Oh, my God!

10:11.272 --> 10:13.007
He has a girlfriend!

10:13.074 --> 10:14.641
He cheated on
his girlfriend

10:14.709 --> 10:15.776
with me.

10:15.844 --> 10:16.843
I'm a cheater.

10:16.910 --> 10:18.311
P. Genz played you?

10:18.379 --> 10:19.312
I saw her.

10:19.380 --> 10:22.081
She looks like an Asian me.

10:22.750 --> 10:25.251
Asian Jess. Wo-- Ow.

10:25.318 --> 10:26.652
I can't even backslide right.

10:26.720 --> 10:27.720
I've been her.

10:27.788 --> 10:29.622
I've been Asian me before.

10:29.689 --> 10:31.190
Are you gonna keep calling her
"Asian me,"

10:31.258 --> 10:32.458
because it's becoming
a problem for me.

10:32.525 --> 10:34.126
I don't know her name, Schmidt.

10:34.193 --> 10:36.194
But I do know
that if I were her,

10:36.262 --> 10:38.830
I would want to know what kind
of person I was dating.

10:38.898 --> 10:40.598
And that's why
I have to tell her.

10:40.666 --> 10:42.200
- What? No, don't do that.
- Please don't do that.

10:42.268 --> 10:43.635
Mm-mm. Sometimes, when
you make a mistake,

10:43.702 --> 10:46.404
all you can do is own up to it,
all right?

10:46.472 --> 10:48.106
Because it's something
you can't fix.

10:48.174 --> 10:49.640
Knowledge.

10:49.707 --> 10:50.674
Take it easy,
black George Michael.

10:50.742 --> 10:51.675
I have to do it.

10:51.743 --> 10:53.710
I have to tell her.

10:53.779 --> 10:55.913
61 years we've
been together.

10:55.981 --> 10:56.914
14 presidents

10:56.982 --> 10:59.316
and four different Batmen.

10:59.384 --> 11:01.218
Why don't we go for a walk?

11:01.286 --> 11:02.653
I'm just gonna go get
your sweater.

11:02.720 --> 11:03.821
- I'll be back in a second.
- Oh, thanks, sweetie.

11:03.889 --> 11:05.822
- Give me one second.
- Wow,

11:05.890 --> 11:07.556
so you guys are like
real live Yodas, huh?

11:07.624 --> 11:09.725
Can I ask you a question?

11:09.794 --> 11:11.694
- Yeah.
- Shoot, cowboy.

11:11.762 --> 11:12.929
How do you build a relationship?

11:12.997 --> 11:14.563
How 'bout Viagra?

11:14.631 --> 11:16.632
I use it just to keep
from falling out of bed.

11:16.700 --> 11:18.567
How does a guy like me
have a chance

11:18.635 --> 11:20.469
at making someone
like Cece happy?

11:20.537 --> 11:23.038
You don't. Not with all those
moles on your face.

11:23.106 --> 11:25.507
- I should just give up, huh?
- That's crazy!

11:25.574 --> 11:26.508
She needs you!

11:28.512 --> 11:30.512
DADI: You are exactly
what she needs.

11:31.848 --> 11:34.249
(sighs)

11:34.317 --> 11:35.517
Here's your sweater, Dadi.

11:35.584 --> 11:37.118
Oh, thank you.

11:37.186 --> 11:38.920
Um, I'll meet you out there
in a second, okay?

11:38.987 --> 11:40.221
Okay.

11:41.289 --> 11:42.723
Take it easy, Burt.

11:42.791 --> 11:44.525
(sighs)

11:45.592 --> 11:47.294
You know, for the first
time in my life

11:47.362 --> 11:50.698
I actually feel like I want
something that lasts.

11:53.134 --> 11:54.635
And I want it with you.

11:54.703 --> 11:58.739
I feel... the same way.

11:58.807 --> 12:00.740
You do?
(groaning)

12:00.808 --> 12:02.742
Oh!
(moaning)

12:02.810 --> 12:04.477
- It hurts so bad, because...
- What's turning you on?

12:04.545 --> 12:05.712
- Oh...
- The queen of diamonds?

12:05.779 --> 12:07.380
- The bow?
- Oh, my God.

12:07.448 --> 12:08.748
The teeth in the glass?

12:08.816 --> 12:10.249
I care about you so much.

12:10.317 --> 12:12.218
- The leaf painting?
- But...

12:12.285 --> 12:14.654
Is emotional intimacy
turning you on?

12:14.722 --> 12:16.755
(groans)

12:16.823 --> 12:18.623
(groaning)
Are you in that much pain?

12:19.191 --> 12:20.158
Uh, he passed out.

12:20.226 --> 12:21.493
We need help!

12:21.561 --> 12:23.495
Yo. What's up, man?

12:23.563 --> 12:24.996
- How'd the audition go?
- What?

12:25.064 --> 12:27.131
- For the Disney pirate movie?
- Ha-ha.

12:27.199 --> 12:28.700
Hey, Mr. T called.

12:28.768 --> 12:30.369
He wants to punch you because
that earring looks stupid.

12:30.436 --> 12:32.470
I mean, Lil' Wayne
wears it, so...

12:32.537 --> 12:33.971
Oh, Little Wayne Gonzales
from Brazil?

12:34.038 --> 12:36.240
Who came to the United States
to dance and be free!

12:36.307 --> 12:38.108
You can't touch me, baby.
I'm in the prime of my life.

12:38.176 --> 12:40.378
Tell me, what are you doing?
What you been doing all day?

12:40.445 --> 12:42.747
Oh, I'm actually looking for
an apartment. It's for Caroline.

12:42.814 --> 12:44.482
She's looking for a new
apartment, and she asked me if

12:44.549 --> 12:46.250
I wanted to move in with her,
and I'm thinking about it.

12:46.317 --> 12:49.386
Cool! Cool, cool,
sounds like so much fun.

12:49.453 --> 12:50.820
I'm really glad that's your
reaction, because I thought

12:50.888 --> 12:52.989
you were going to tell me
I was making a huge mistake.

12:53.056 --> 12:54.290
Honestly, I didn't
want to hear that.

12:54.358 --> 12:56.559
Wouldn't do that,
that'd be silly.

12:56.627 --> 12:58.728
(Winston trilling)

12:58.796 --> 13:01.130
(cawing)

13:01.198 --> 13:03.700
What are you doing? Huh? What?

13:03.768 --> 13:05.401
No, Nick...
No, no, no! No!

13:05.468 --> 13:07.168
Nick. Nick. Nick, Nick!
Nick! Don't!

13:07.236 --> 13:09.170
It's for your own good.

13:09.238 --> 13:11.006
- Get out of there!
- What are you...? No, Schmidt!

13:11.073 --> 13:12.173
Grab him!
Okay, grab him.

13:12.241 --> 13:13.475
You got him?

13:13.543 --> 13:14.543
- Watch the television.
- You got him?

13:14.611 --> 13:16.077
Watch it. Watch it.

13:16.145 --> 13:17.345
Watch the television.
Watch the TV...

13:17.414 --> 13:18.781
All right, all right,
watch the TV.

13:18.848 --> 13:20.015
- Hello, Nick...
NICK: No!

13:20.082 --> 13:21.516
In all its glory,
watch it.

13:21.583 --> 13:23.751
- You magnificent dumb-ass.
- Come on.

13:23.819 --> 13:25.520
If you're watching this,

13:25.587 --> 13:27.655
it's because you decided
to get back with Caroline.

13:27.723 --> 13:29.323
Yes, Nick. I did.

13:29.391 --> 13:31.158
Well, congratulations,
you idiot.

13:31.226 --> 13:33.861
- She destroyed you.
- You don't know me, you jerk!

13:33.929 --> 13:35.930
These, my dumb friend,
are your tears.

13:35.997 --> 13:38.164
- And you saved them all.
- I got him, I got him.

13:38.232 --> 13:39.599
Think back, Nick,
Stay still.

13:39.667 --> 13:40.500
Or whatever they call you
in your time.

13:40.568 --> 13:42.536
Who dumped you three times?

13:42.603 --> 13:44.938
Once before you had to speak
at your brother's wedding.

13:45.005 --> 13:46.740
Well, he's divorced now,
so I'll get another shot.

13:46.808 --> 13:48.141
- This is a poem you wrote about Caroline...
- I don't want the poem.

13:48.208 --> 13:49.609
- I don't want the poem.
- You're getting the poem.

13:49.677 --> 13:51.478
...But you're too emotional
to read it right now.

13:51.546 --> 13:53.679
You're going to give it
to Schmidt for safekeeping.

13:57.584 --> 13:59.184
This is your
doing, Caroline.

13:59.252 --> 14:00.753
You were right to
have trusted me.

14:00.821 --> 14:02.888
Two years I held
this thing.

14:02.956 --> 14:04.857
- Read it.
(sobbing): Here they come.

14:04.925 --> 14:06.358
NICK:
Okay.

14:06.426 --> 14:09.527
"Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?

14:09.595 --> 14:12.363
No, a summer's day
is not a bitch."

14:12.431 --> 14:14.499
(Nick whimpers on video)
Really, Nick?

14:14.567 --> 14:15.834
That's how you want
to talk about Caroline?

14:15.901 --> 14:17.234
I can't move, my
earring is stuck.

14:17.302 --> 14:19.170
But there's something
I want to do to you, then.

14:19.237 --> 14:21.305
Don't move, don't move.
Don't move, Nick, don't move!

14:21.373 --> 14:22.774
Let's have a conversation like men!
Let's act like men, Nick! Ah!

14:22.842 --> 14:24.008
You want to act like men,
let's act like men.

14:24.076 --> 14:27.010
Look at how far
you've come, Nick.

14:27.078 --> 14:29.245
- Want to be a bartender forever, pal?
- I'm still a bartender.

14:29.313 --> 14:31.014
You want to be a grown man

14:31.082 --> 14:33.884
who dresses like an unsponsored
professional skateboarder?

14:33.952 --> 14:36.353
You don't want to live like
this. You're moving on.

14:36.420 --> 14:37.955
I'm here to tell you
you're doing the right thing,

14:38.022 --> 14:39.523
so just keep going.

14:39.591 --> 14:42.458
Can I talk to you Nick-to-Nick
for a second?

14:42.526 --> 14:45.027
I respect you, man.
You're rocking the hell

14:45.095 --> 14:47.363
out of that beard,
and the long hair looks good,

14:47.430 --> 14:49.031
despite what other people
are gonna say.

14:49.099 --> 14:50.967
Look, the Caroline
that broke your heart,

14:51.034 --> 14:54.003
I get why you don't like her.

14:54.070 --> 14:55.671
But it's a different Caroline
that's picking me up

14:55.739 --> 14:57.572
(groans)
in five minutes, Nick.

14:57.640 --> 14:58.740
Do you want me to live alone
in this loft

14:58.808 --> 15:00.542
for the rest of my life?

15:00.610 --> 15:03.879
Hey, what's the difference
between me and Bill Cosby?

15:03.946 --> 15:05.547
Well, thanks, guys. You helped
me figure something out.

15:05.615 --> 15:07.749
NICK (on video):
All right, well, look,

15:07.817 --> 15:09.951
I think this was a really
nice talk, Future Nick.

15:10.019 --> 15:12.186
I hope you got something from
it, 'cause I know that I did.

15:14.188 --> 15:15.890
(crying):
I'm gonna call her.

15:15.957 --> 15:18.125
- I have to call..
- No! Damn it, give me the phone.

15:18.192 --> 15:19.894
- Please get out of here, I have to call...
Coach! He's calling her again.

15:19.961 --> 15:23.531
- We lost him.
- We sure did, Captain Black Sparrow.

15:23.598 --> 15:25.065
- Hey, Paul.
- Hey.

15:25.133 --> 15:27.167
I'm not going to let you
lie to your girlfriend.

15:27.235 --> 15:29.268
Okay? It's not fair to her.

15:29.336 --> 15:31.804
So you have to tell her
what happened between us.

15:31.872 --> 15:33.072
Or I will.

15:33.140 --> 15:35.207
All right.
You're right.

15:35.275 --> 15:37.510
- I have to tell her.
- Yeah.

15:37.578 --> 15:39.078
I'm so scared, though.
I don't want to lose her, Jess.

15:39.646 --> 15:41.047
She's my soul mate.

15:41.114 --> 15:43.249
For someone with a soul mate,
you sure did have sex with me.

15:43.316 --> 15:45.584
I know. I know, and I don't
expect you to believe me--

15:45.652 --> 15:47.352
I wouldn't believe me
if I were you--

15:47.420 --> 15:49.721
but check it out.

15:49.789 --> 15:51.890
I even bought her
an engagement ring.

15:51.958 --> 15:53.027
(sighs)

15:53.358 --> 15:54.427
Oh...

15:55.494 --> 15:57.829
That's... that's
really beautiful.

15:57.897 --> 15:59.197
I've been carrying it around
in my pocket for two weeks,

15:59.265 --> 16:00.831
trying to find the right way
to propose to her.

16:00.899 --> 16:03.400
And I just started panicking,
and I got...

16:03.468 --> 16:06.336
I don't know, I got scared,
and-and-and really confused,

16:06.404 --> 16:08.205
and I'm so sorry
to drag you into this,

16:08.273 --> 16:09.707
but this was the biggest
mistake of my life.

16:09.775 --> 16:11.776
God, Paul, don't make me
feel sorry for you.

16:11.843 --> 16:13.044
I know. I messed up.

16:13.111 --> 16:14.812
Big-time.

16:14.880 --> 16:16.013
And I'm going to lose her.

16:16.081 --> 16:17.981
Oh, God, I can't lose her!

16:18.049 --> 16:20.383
Hey, babe, you left
your tuner in my car.

16:20.451 --> 16:23.019
Oh. Hi!
You're Jess, right?

16:23.087 --> 16:24.253
I'm Jenn.

16:24.321 --> 16:26.056
Jenn.

16:28.993 --> 16:30.760
Well, I was just leaving.

16:30.828 --> 16:33.562
- Jess and I slept together.
- Oh, God.

16:33.630 --> 16:35.363
- What? - I want to be
completely honest with you.

16:35.431 --> 16:37.232
It happened two days ago,
and we did lots of stuff.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.401
There was talking,
and there were hands,

16:39.469 --> 16:41.536
- and I think we ruined a throw pillow.
- He's making it sound

16:41.605 --> 16:43.138
a lot more erotic than it was.

16:43.206 --> 16:45.841
It was just, like,
lying there and... blah.

16:45.909 --> 16:47.710
I am so sorry.

16:47.777 --> 16:49.477
I'm... I'm begging you
to forgive me.

16:49.544 --> 16:51.445
(crying):
I thought you loved me.

16:51.513 --> 16:52.814
I'm so sorry.

16:52.881 --> 16:54.649
(crying):
I'm an idiot!

16:54.717 --> 16:56.417
(sniffles)

16:56.485 --> 16:59.020
- I'm an idiot, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, my God. No...

16:59.088 --> 17:01.823
Yeah, I'm such an idiot.
(sobbing)

17:01.890 --> 17:03.357
Good-bye, Paul.

17:03.425 --> 17:05.558
Oh, no.
Wait. Wait. Jenn?

17:05.627 --> 17:07.193
Haven't you done enough?

17:07.261 --> 17:10.631
Yeah, I have.
I have done enough, but...

17:12.634 --> 17:15.367
I know how you feel.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.938
I've been there.
I've been cheated on before,

17:18.006 --> 17:19.673
and it feels like someone

17:19.741 --> 17:21.473
dropped an anvil on your heart.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.976
Um, but...

17:24.044 --> 17:26.779
That guy wasn't right for me.

17:27.347 --> 17:28.013
You guys...

17:28.080 --> 17:29.815
You guys are perfect together.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.885
I thought you were Asian me,

17:32.953 --> 17:35.988
but now I realize
I'm just Caucasian you.

17:36.056 --> 17:37.321
- What?
- What?

17:37.389 --> 17:38.857
Paul was scared.

17:38.924 --> 17:40.091
And when you're scared,

17:40.159 --> 17:42.093
you do stupid things.

17:42.161 --> 17:44.095
He made a really
terrible mistake.

17:44.163 --> 17:46.031
Really terrible.

17:46.098 --> 17:48.667
The things that we did
48 hours ago were so dark...

17:48.734 --> 17:50.368
- I'm handling this.
- Sorry.

17:50.435 --> 17:52.803
Jenn...

17:52.871 --> 17:54.271
you love Paul.

17:54.838 --> 17:55.839
I know that

17:55.907 --> 17:57.340
because you're still
standing here.

17:57.408 --> 17:59.777
What you guys have...

17:59.844 --> 18:01.378
it's way bigger than me.

18:02.195 --> 18:03.847
And I think...

18:03.915 --> 18:05.683
I think Paul has something
to ask you.

18:07.185 --> 18:09.318
I know this is not
the right time to do this,

18:09.386 --> 18:11.821
in fact, this is
a terrible time to do this,

18:11.889 --> 18:13.723
but I don't care.

18:13.791 --> 18:15.725
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you,

18:15.793 --> 18:18.194
Jennifer Ruth Toyogi.

18:18.261 --> 18:20.863
- I know that now more than ever.
- Now that you slept with her.

18:20.931 --> 18:23.900
Happy to help.
Uh-huh.

18:23.967 --> 18:27.602
If... if you still love me,
at all...

18:27.670 --> 18:29.504
Of course I still do. I...

18:29.572 --> 18:30.806
(sighs)

18:30.873 --> 18:32.607
Oh, yeah.

18:32.675 --> 18:33.742
Um...

18:35.311 --> 18:36.477
Ooh...

18:36.545 --> 18:38.113
Will you... will you...

18:38.181 --> 18:40.248
will you, will you marry him?

18:40.316 --> 18:42.549
(whispers):
Yeah.

18:48.190 --> 18:49.924
- Is that a "yes"?
- Yes.

18:53.394 --> 18:56.896
(boy playing
"Bridal Chorus")

19:02.714 --> 19:04.682
So you and Cece are staying
away from each other.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.400
Only until my penis
stops looking

19:06.467 --> 19:08.269
like a knotted wizard's staff.

19:08.336 --> 19:10.536
- That sounds tough, man.
- Guys like us--

19:10.604 --> 19:13.239
Nick, too--
we're warriors.

19:13.307 --> 19:15.474
We just keep on fighting,
and holding on,

19:15.542 --> 19:17.911
even when we know we're
just making a big mistake.

19:17.978 --> 19:19.412
Like Nick and Caroline.

19:19.479 --> 19:21.547
- And that earring.
- I'm not giving this thing up.

19:21.615 --> 19:23.116
You look like you were caught
by a fly fisherman.

19:23.183 --> 19:24.483
Dude, I've had it with
the earring jokes.

19:24.551 --> 19:25.984
You look like you should be
standing in line

19:26.052 --> 19:27.719
to get into Shaquille O'Neal's
birthday party.

19:27.787 --> 19:28.820
Oh, my God, you guys.

19:28.888 --> 19:30.855
The most exciting thing
just happened.

19:30.924 --> 19:33.725
I helped Paul propose to his
girlfriend. They are engaged.

19:33.793 --> 19:35.360
- Awesome. - I feel like you're
leaving out part of that story.

19:35.428 --> 19:37.662
Where's Nick?
I want to tell him.

19:37.730 --> 19:39.264
This should be fun. Um...

19:39.332 --> 19:40.966
yeah, Nick has something
to tell you, too.

19:41.034 --> 19:43.000
- He's in the bathroom.
- Oh, great.

19:44.269 --> 19:46.503
- Really?
- She's gonna find out anyway.

19:46.571 --> 19:48.505
(water running)
Nick! Nick!

19:48.573 --> 19:50.174
- Hey.
- What, Jess?

19:50.742 --> 19:54.245
Um, Paul proposed to his
girlfriend in front of me.

19:55.063 --> 19:56.280
That sounds pretty awkward.

19:56.348 --> 19:58.481
She said yes, and it
was... it was really...

19:58.549 --> 19:59.849
it was really beautiful.

19:59.917 --> 20:01.985
And it made me
realize something.

20:02.053 --> 20:04.587
You're wrong. All the stuff
you said about Caroline,

20:04.655 --> 20:06.889
being about timing,

20:06.958 --> 20:09.459
and it just making sense?

20:10.276 --> 20:11.361
No.

20:11.429 --> 20:15.064
Because if you really
love someone, it's simple.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.967
Okay. Well, I understand
what you're saying, but...

20:18.034 --> 20:20.302
You deserve something amazing.

20:20.370 --> 20:22.704
And... you deserve love.

20:23.772 --> 20:25.274
I know you don't
want to be alone,

20:25.992 --> 20:27.542
but I'm going to be there,

20:27.610 --> 20:31.245
and I'll tell that Tom Waits
voice in your head to shut up.

20:33.415 --> 20:35.516
(Tom Waits voice):
We don't have to settle...

20:35.584 --> 20:37.618
Nick.

20:37.686 --> 20:39.687
You're the best.

20:41.590 --> 20:42.990
I'm moving in with Caroline.

20:47.560 --> 20:49.195
We signed a lease this morning.

20:49.930 --> 20:52.165
Thanks for saying
all that stuff.

Now that I got your attention,
Future Nick,

21:03.228 --> 21:06.695
there's a few things
I'd like to talk to you about.

21:06.813 --> 21:08.481
Be nicer to your mom
when she calls.

21:08.548 --> 21:10.149
Stop giving yourself high fives.

21:10.217 --> 21:12.251
Put your head underwater,
you two-year-old.

21:12.319 --> 21:14.686
Be nicer to Coach,
or he's gonna take off,

21:15.054 --> 21:16.622
live with a bunch
of other white people.

21:16.689 --> 21:17.823
(bad accent):
I no fake karate.

21:17.891 --> 21:19.457
I'm Nick, I'm grumpy.

21:19.525 --> 21:20.958
I'm going to put
my baby hood on.

21:21.027 --> 21:23.028
Sex is a sprint,
not a marathon.

21:23.095 --> 21:24.962
♪ You are special,
you are special ♪

21:25.031 --> 21:27.098
♪ You... ♪

21:27.166 --> 21:29.200
We'll see each other
in the future...

21:29.268 --> 21:31.469
unless I see you first.
Nick Miller!
