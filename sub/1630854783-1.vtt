WEBVTT

01:01.148 --> 01:02.584
[boat engine idles]

01:07.676 --> 01:09.591
All right.
Well, the water looks good.

01:09.678 --> 01:10.679
I think we're all set.

01:10.766 --> 01:12.159
It hasn't rained in a while,

01:12.246 --> 01:13.595
so there should
be maximum visibility.

01:29.828 --> 01:30.829
Just follow my lead.

01:30.916 --> 01:32.527
Yeah, right.

01:32.614 --> 01:33.441
I'm not the one who wanted
to quit early last time.

01:33.528 --> 01:35.660
You follow my lead.

01:35.747 --> 01:38.185
Oh, I see how it is.

01:38.272 --> 01:40.187
First person out of the water
buys drinks tonight.

01:40.274 --> 01:41.144
Oh, you are on.

01:41.231 --> 01:43.364
[splashes]

01:58.727 --> 02:00.555
Got you!

02:01.686 --> 02:03.210
Just dive, you goofball.

03:19.286 --> 03:20.417
[shrieking]

03:30.514 --> 03:33.952
Mike!
Mike!

03:41.917 --> 03:43.658
[muffled shouting]

03:49.446 --> 03:51.274
Ah!

03:57.280 --> 03:58.673
[shrieks]

04:19.389 --> 04:20.695
Are you sure this
is the right pier?

04:20.782 --> 04:23.219
That's what
the directions said.

04:23.306 --> 04:24.742
Do you have all your gear?

04:24.829 --> 04:27.397
Yes, Dad. I double checked
this morning.

04:27.484 --> 04:29.443
All right, let's go.

04:34.839 --> 04:36.972
It's supposed to be
around here somewhere.

04:37.059 --> 04:39.366
With a name like the Jubilation,

04:39.453 --> 04:41.150
it shouldn't be
that hard to find.

04:41.237 --> 04:43.761
Well, you could just starting
screaming, "Jubilation!

04:43.848 --> 04:44.849
Jubilation!"

04:44.936 --> 04:46.634
That should get their attention.

04:46.721 --> 04:47.722
I don't know if that's the
attention I want, Dad.

04:50.725 --> 04:52.683
You know, I really wish you
were coming on this one with me.

04:52.770 --> 04:55.382
One of my sea legs is faulty.

04:55.469 --> 04:58.863
But as soon as I get my bum leg
out of this stinky cast,

04:58.950 --> 05:01.649
we'll hit
the high seas again, okay?

05:03.651 --> 05:05.000
On this one, you need
to scout

05:05.087 --> 05:08.003
this new charter boat
and the captain.

05:08.090 --> 05:10.222
Make sure they are
both up to snuff, okay?

05:10.310 --> 05:12.399
Sir, yes, sir.

05:12.486 --> 05:14.052
On a very important
scouting mission.

05:14.139 --> 05:16.490
What's the name
of this captain again? Banning?

05:16.577 --> 05:18.318
Captain Banning.

05:18.405 --> 05:21.016
And remember, be respectful
of her and her boat, okay,

05:21.103 --> 05:23.714
just like Papi taught you.

05:25.107 --> 05:28.502
Hey, can you slow down
just a little bit?

05:28.589 --> 05:29.633
They won't
leave without you, I promise.

05:29.720 --> 05:31.679
I paid a lot for this charter.

05:32.897 --> 05:33.942
Are you okay?

05:38.903 --> 05:40.078
Si.

05:40.165 --> 05:41.863
I just wanted to show you this.

05:44.779 --> 05:46.694
You did not bring this picture!

05:46.781 --> 05:50.045
I did bring this picture.

05:50.132 --> 05:51.829
It's so embarrassing.

05:51.916 --> 05:53.614
You know, I'm glad you're
not coming on this trip.

05:53.701 --> 05:55.267
-You're way too embarrassing.
-You take that back!

05:55.355 --> 05:58.488
Okay, fine. I wish you were
coming on this trip.

05:58.575 --> 05:59.794
But enough with
the picture already.

05:59.881 --> 06:01.012
I love this picture!
Look at you.

06:01.099 --> 06:02.623
So determined.

06:02.710 --> 06:04.581
Eight years old, out
in the pouring rain

06:04.668 --> 06:07.367
at the break of dawn
tossing that reel over and over

06:07.454 --> 06:09.717
again trying to nab
the big one, huh?

06:09.804 --> 06:11.632
Just like Papi?

06:11.719 --> 06:14.939
Yeah, well, I hope I get to reel
in some big yellowfin soon.

06:16.114 --> 06:18.029
Oh, wait.

06:18.116 --> 06:19.814
I think I see it.

06:21.642 --> 06:26.734
Yeah, that's it, the Jubilation.

06:26.821 --> 06:28.779
Kind of looks like an old boat.

06:28.866 --> 06:29.998
Uh-huh.

06:31.739 --> 06:33.567
So you want me
to walk you out on the boat?

06:33.654 --> 06:35.873
No, Dad.
I'm a big girl.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.397
I think I can handle
this on my own.

06:37.484 --> 06:38.920
Okay, good.

06:39.007 --> 06:40.487
'Cause I don't think this cast

06:40.574 --> 06:41.923
will make it out
on that rickety dock.

06:44.752 --> 06:46.101
Dad...

06:48.233 --> 06:51.846
Okay, remember, be respectful of
the captain and her boat, okay?

06:51.933 --> 06:55.110
Oh, and if you need
any tips, you call me?

06:55.197 --> 06:56.677
-Yeah.
-Okay.

06:56.764 --> 06:58.940
Oh, and photos.
Take lots of photos.

06:59.027 --> 07:00.028
Okay, lot of pics,
yeah, okay, I got it.

07:00.115 --> 07:01.725
I gotta go.
I'm late.

07:01.812 --> 07:03.988
-Bye, I love you.
-Okay. I love you too, Lucia.

07:09.951 --> 07:11.169
My little angler.

07:13.084 --> 07:14.869
Okay, then.

07:22.964 --> 07:25.445
Captain Banning?

07:25.532 --> 07:27.621
Yep, that's me.

07:27.708 --> 07:29.753
Oh, I thought...

07:29.840 --> 07:31.799
You thought you'd
see a woman, right?

07:31.886 --> 07:35.672
N-n-no, I didn't think...

07:35.759 --> 07:38.458
I wanna captain
my own boat one day.

07:38.545 --> 07:39.894
My dad just...

07:39.981 --> 07:41.896
It's okay, it's okay.

07:41.983 --> 07:44.115
I guess with a name like
Shelly you can't help it.

07:44.202 --> 07:47.510
People see the paperwork before
they get here all the time,

07:47.597 --> 07:50.078
they think they're gonna
see some old salty sea hag.

07:50.165 --> 07:53.603
Then they see me and you have
that same look on your face

07:53.690 --> 07:58.652
that you have when they see
this salty old sea dog instead.

07:58.739 --> 08:00.567
You must be Lucia.

08:00.654 --> 08:02.133
That's me.

08:02.220 --> 08:03.874
Jump on aboard, Lucia.

08:03.961 --> 08:05.528
Thanks.

08:05.615 --> 08:07.922
I'm looking forward to
catching some yellowfins.

08:08.009 --> 08:09.532
My dad and I,
we caught some

08:09.619 --> 08:11.186
a few years back up north
in San Diego.

08:11.273 --> 08:13.884
Yeah. Fish is good up there,

08:13.971 --> 08:16.844
especially this time of the
year, but we have bigger ones.

08:19.760 --> 08:22.806
Your fellow anglers
have arrived.

08:22.893 --> 08:24.591
Oh, I can't wait
to get out there, D.

08:24.678 --> 08:26.854
I haven't gone fishing in
I don't know how long.

08:26.941 --> 08:28.986
And the horseback riding
on the beach tomorrow...

08:29.073 --> 08:31.511
one for the bucket list.

08:31.598 --> 08:32.903
And today I get to take off

08:32.990 --> 08:34.601
deep sea fishing
off my bucket list.

08:36.559 --> 08:38.039
Me too.

08:38.126 --> 08:40.215
Who knows?
Maybe I'm secretly an expert.

08:40.302 --> 08:43.914
Well, there's
only way to find out.

08:49.790 --> 08:52.662
Hey, I'm Wyatt.
This is my fiancÃ©, Donna.

08:52.749 --> 08:54.925
Hi.

08:55.012 --> 08:56.013
This is Lucia.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.580
Hey.

08:57.667 --> 08:59.060
And I'm your captain
for the day.

08:59.147 --> 09:00.714
Call me Banning,
Captain Banning,

09:00.801 --> 09:01.802
whatever you want.

09:01.889 --> 09:03.455
Just don't call me Shelly.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.240
[laughing]

09:05.327 --> 09:08.722
Got the new radio, Captain.

09:08.809 --> 09:10.898
And this here's Shatto.

09:10.985 --> 09:13.770
He really doesn't talk much.

09:13.857 --> 09:15.250
He talks enough for both of us.

09:17.339 --> 09:19.210
Shatto's my first mate.

09:19.297 --> 09:21.038
You been mate
for how long, Shatto?

09:21.125 --> 09:22.605
Uh, too long.

09:24.999 --> 09:27.436
Too long, yep.
That's about right.

09:27.523 --> 09:29.656
We got a few life vests for you.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.791
Do we have to wear these?

09:34.878 --> 09:36.880
I'm just concerned... I'm really
trying to get like a tan.

09:36.967 --> 09:38.795
And I don't want to mess
up a tan line, you know.

09:38.882 --> 09:41.493
Uh, if you're
on this ship, you do.

09:41.581 --> 09:42.886
It's regulations.

09:42.973 --> 09:45.106
No exceptions, no excuses.

09:45.193 --> 09:46.934
You can probably
take it off later on

09:47.021 --> 09:48.283
when we get past
the Coast Guard.

09:50.024 --> 09:51.895
I can make this work.

09:51.982 --> 09:53.984
We're gonna have to
make helmets work tomorrow

09:54.071 --> 09:54.985
for horseback riding.

09:55.072 --> 09:57.771
I guess you're right, D.

09:57.858 --> 09:59.642
So there's
a little something

09:59.729 --> 10:02.863
that I like to do
before we go on a voyage.

10:02.950 --> 10:06.344
Not that I believe in luck, but
it's supposed to bring us some.

10:08.216 --> 10:09.957
So here goes.

10:10.044 --> 10:11.741
It's a fisherman's poem.

10:13.830 --> 10:17.094
"Give me luck to
catch a fish so big

10:17.181 --> 10:20.750
"so that even I, when
talking about it afterwards,

10:20.837 --> 10:22.360
may not ever have to lie."

10:27.757 --> 10:29.890
Shatto, let's get this
"before" pic out the way.

10:29.977 --> 10:32.588
And maybe the "after" pic,

10:32.675 --> 10:35.199
the boat will be filled with
fish bigger than your dreams.

10:35.286 --> 10:36.592
-[chuckles]
-Yeah.

10:36.679 --> 10:38.159
Hey, my dad used
to have a camera

10:38.246 --> 10:39.856
like that when I was a kid.

10:39.943 --> 10:43.730
You hear that, Shatto?
We're older than dirt.

10:44.992 --> 10:47.429
Come on.
Huddle up together, y'all.

10:49.866 --> 10:51.999
-Say "feesh"!
-Feesh!

11:08.798 --> 11:10.234
Hey, you know, my
pop taught me

11:10.321 --> 11:11.888
how to drive a boat like
this when I was a kid.

11:11.975 --> 11:13.760
-Oh, is that right?
-Yeah.

11:13.847 --> 11:15.892
What do you think about me
taking it for a joy ride

11:15.979 --> 11:17.677
once we're on the open water?

11:17.764 --> 11:18.765
[laughs]

11:18.852 --> 11:21.071
Not on your life, kid.

11:21.158 --> 11:25.249
Besides, you're gonna be too
busy pulling in a lot of fish.

11:25.336 --> 11:26.903
So you won't be able
to steer this vessel.

11:28.339 --> 11:29.427
Worth a shot.

11:30.951 --> 11:32.779
Now you all have your
licenses intact,

11:32.866 --> 11:34.084
which means you're gonna be on

11:34.171 --> 11:36.304
the Jubilation for
like five hours.

11:36.391 --> 11:40.047
Now the Jubilation
may not look like much,

11:40.134 --> 11:44.704
but she's a tough old broad,
kind of like my ex-wife.

11:44.791 --> 11:47.707
Now I won her
in a high-stakes poker game

11:47.794 --> 11:51.188
in Chicago playing against
a Lake Michigan pirate.

11:51.275 --> 11:54.061
He could barely hold his hand.

11:54.148 --> 11:59.283
So I skunked him and he followed
me all throughout Lake Michigan,

11:59.370 --> 12:03.984
Erie and Superior
trying to get his boat back.

12:04.071 --> 12:05.681
So I had to come all the way
to Cabo

12:05.768 --> 12:07.248
just to get him off my tail.

12:07.335 --> 12:09.250
True story.

12:09.337 --> 12:11.426
We're gonna go out
a little bit further.

12:11.513 --> 12:15.560
You can blame it on
global warming, the Illuminati,

12:15.647 --> 12:17.867
Big Foot, I don't care.

12:17.954 --> 12:22.742
It's just that fishing's
been a little light this season,

12:22.829 --> 12:24.308
but I know a place.

12:24.395 --> 12:27.224
We go out further where
you're gonna catch

12:27.311 --> 12:30.924
a certain amount of
divine yellowfish tuna

12:31.011 --> 12:32.839
that you've ever seen.

12:32.926 --> 12:37.060
So just sit your butts
in your seat and enjoy the ride.

13:17.884 --> 13:19.276
He's a character.

13:19.363 --> 13:20.364
That he is, bro.

13:21.539 --> 13:23.890
How long you been
doing this for?

13:23.977 --> 13:26.240
A few years.

13:26.327 --> 13:30.113
Captain took me in when I was
caught up in some bad stuff.

13:30.200 --> 13:33.987
Taught me everything I need
to know about this boat.

13:34.074 --> 13:35.858
Gave me some purpose, you know.

13:37.904 --> 13:38.948
He knows what
he's doing, though.

13:41.255 --> 13:42.996
That story about
him winning the boat

13:43.083 --> 13:45.737
in a poker game, is that true?

13:45.825 --> 13:49.045
No clue, and I've asked.

13:49.132 --> 13:51.221
I can never get a
straight answer out of him.

13:53.006 --> 13:55.530
Details change from one
charter to the next, though.

13:55.617 --> 13:58.272
[engine revs]

14:05.932 --> 14:07.411
You know, you really
shouldn't text on a boat.

14:09.109 --> 14:10.153
It'll make you puke.

14:12.547 --> 14:14.201
Not me.

14:14.288 --> 14:16.856
I've never gotten seasick once.

14:16.943 --> 14:19.162
Lucky you.

14:19.249 --> 14:20.381
Texting your boyfriend?

14:22.339 --> 14:24.037
My dad.

14:24.124 --> 14:25.255
He worries.

14:25.342 --> 14:27.083
Only child?

14:27.170 --> 14:28.302
Yeah.

14:28.389 --> 14:30.043
Me too.

14:30.130 --> 14:33.089
Sometimes
you love the smothering.

14:33.176 --> 14:36.310
Sometimes the smothering
is just so... smothering.

14:36.397 --> 14:38.094
Yeah, sometimes.

14:40.009 --> 14:41.663
It's just been him
and I for so long.

14:41.750 --> 14:45.449
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that,
but I know the feeling.

14:47.060 --> 14:48.975
I'm lucky to have found Wyatt.

14:49.062 --> 14:50.890
He has four brothers.

14:50.977 --> 14:53.588
Family gatherings will
never be boring again.

14:55.982 --> 14:57.244
That's beautiful.

14:57.331 --> 14:59.202
Oh, thank you.

14:59.289 --> 15:02.162
Yeah, he's got good taste.

15:02.249 --> 15:03.946
Think I'll keep him.

15:05.165 --> 15:06.906
It seems like he
really loves you.

15:06.993 --> 15:09.517
Like I said,
he's got good taste.

15:29.276 --> 15:30.668
Woo-hoo!

15:41.201 --> 15:42.854
This is it, y'all!

15:42.942 --> 15:47.468
Water's a bit choppy,
but this is my secret spot.

15:47.555 --> 15:49.209
You can't see it right now,

15:49.296 --> 15:53.953
but you look right over there,
that's a sandbar.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.955
Kinda acts as a barrier,

15:56.042 --> 16:00.437
sort of funnels
the bigger fish this way.

16:00.524 --> 16:03.527
Later on this evening
when the tide recedes,

16:03.614 --> 16:06.617
those beautiful yellowfin tuna

16:06.704 --> 16:09.446
will have no place to go but
jump on our hooks.

16:22.372 --> 16:25.288
Nice setup you got there.

16:25.375 --> 16:26.681
Thanks.

16:26.768 --> 16:29.989
My dad and I kinda
collect lures.

16:30.076 --> 16:32.469
When I was a kid,
I would beg my dad

16:32.556 --> 16:35.037
to bring me to the sport shop
whenever I had enough money

16:35.124 --> 16:38.649
in my allowance
or birthday card.

16:38.736 --> 16:40.695
I'd run right to
the fishing section

16:40.782 --> 16:44.742
and I'd spend hours picking out
a rainbow jig or fly spinner.

16:46.179 --> 16:49.312
Well, I see you
got one of these.

16:49.399 --> 16:53.055
I got one of these, but never
had to use it, though.

16:54.056 --> 16:56.102
Gotta be prepared.

16:56.189 --> 16:57.277
I see you are.

16:59.540 --> 17:01.716
Sure you don't wanna
use live bait?

17:01.803 --> 17:05.981
I mean, those yellowfins
sure do love some mackerel.

17:06.068 --> 17:09.245
Thanks.
I prefer the jig.

17:09.332 --> 17:11.334
Less chance of the bait
coming off the hook.

17:11.421 --> 17:16.731
But I will give the mackerel
a shot if my jigs don't hold up.

17:18.298 --> 17:20.648
Spoken like a true angler.

17:20.735 --> 17:23.477
I'm gonna let you get to it.

17:23.564 --> 17:25.261
Think I'm gonna check
on our happy couple.

17:39.232 --> 17:40.755
You two better get
some bait on your hooks.

17:46.152 --> 17:48.719
Oh, those are definitely
not beers.

17:48.806 --> 17:51.113
Nope.
Frozen mackerel.

17:51.200 --> 17:54.899
Those yellowfins will gobble
them bad boys up, I guarantee.

17:54.986 --> 17:58.338
Shatto, help this fine couple
bait their hooks up, will you?

17:58.425 --> 18:00.122
Aye, Cap.

18:00.209 --> 18:01.297
You wanna give it a try?

18:01.384 --> 18:02.777
Why don't you do the first one

18:02.864 --> 18:05.258
so we'll know how
to do it properly?

18:07.260 --> 18:10.611
You're gonna want to get it
right through the eyes.

18:10.698 --> 18:13.614
Right through there
so they can't turn around

18:13.701 --> 18:15.529
and bite the hook.
See?

18:15.616 --> 18:16.747
I see.

18:18.575 --> 18:20.751
Right through there. All right.
You can try the next one.

18:20.838 --> 18:23.798
You're all ready to reel in a
real prize catch there, D.

18:23.885 --> 18:25.974
I already got
a prize catch, babe.

18:26.061 --> 18:27.715
Ooh.

18:42.904 --> 18:46.168
How about we up-anchor
and move a bit further out?

18:50.477 --> 18:51.782
Whatever you say, Captain.

19:07.407 --> 19:09.626
Sure about this, Cap?

19:09.713 --> 19:12.455
We never been this far
out on the charter before.

19:12.542 --> 19:14.501
You know, there's a lot more
dangerous things than yellowfin

19:14.588 --> 19:16.111
in the deep water.

19:16.198 --> 19:18.635
Shatto, they came to catch fish.

19:18.722 --> 19:20.333
They don't wanna waste
their time and money.

19:21.334 --> 19:22.465
We'll be fine.

19:30.473 --> 19:31.605
[typing]

19:34.869 --> 19:36.697
[computers beeping]

19:45.314 --> 19:46.837
Yeah.

19:46.924 --> 19:48.448
Yeah, understood.

19:48.535 --> 19:50.319
I'll have him in the sky ASAP.

20:00.286 --> 20:02.810
Davila, we need you
in the air now.

20:02.897 --> 20:04.768
We just got a report
of a jet ski attack

20:04.855 --> 20:06.553
involving sharks.

20:06.640 --> 20:08.816
We need to make
sure these shivers

20:08.903 --> 20:10.818
aren't moving closer to shore.

20:10.905 --> 20:11.819
On my way, Officer Fuentes.

20:38.411 --> 20:39.673
Do you see anything?

20:42.893 --> 20:44.634
Nothing yet.
Just some jet ski debris.

20:46.767 --> 20:49.248
Wait, wait.

20:49.335 --> 20:50.336
I see a whole shiver.

20:53.295 --> 20:55.602
They're attacking the
jet ski debris.

20:55.689 --> 20:56.820
But it makes no sense.

20:56.907 --> 20:58.735
There's nothing for them to eat.

21:00.737 --> 21:02.565
[sighs]

21:02.652 --> 21:05.394
These sharks have gotten more
aggressive in recent years.

21:05.481 --> 21:09.616
My brother just had a run-in,
I don't know, a few months ago.

21:09.703 --> 21:12.445
Yeah, it looks like they're
staying away from shore,

21:12.532 --> 21:14.882
moving more out
in the open water.

21:14.969 --> 21:16.057
Copy that.

21:19.887 --> 21:22.585
My recommendation is to send
a warning out

21:22.672 --> 21:24.892
to all vessels within
10 miles of shore.

21:24.979 --> 21:29.592
No in-water activities, no
swimming or diving, no fishing.

21:29.679 --> 21:32.769
These sharks have become
hyper-aggressive nowadays.

21:32.856 --> 21:34.554
All right.

21:34.641 --> 21:35.903
I'll get
the word out immediately,

21:35.990 --> 21:37.426
but you keep flying.

21:37.513 --> 21:39.210
See if you can spot
any more of them.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.343
And see if you find out exactly
where they're heading.

21:41.430 --> 21:42.866
Copy that.

21:42.953 --> 21:44.346
I'll stay as close
to them as I can.

21:44.433 --> 21:45.565
All right, good.
Out.

21:46.914 --> 21:48.785
Open an emergency line.

21:51.353 --> 21:53.094
Warning!

21:53.181 --> 21:55.662
All vessels must cease in-water
activity immediately!

21:55.749 --> 21:59.318
Make your way back to shore
only if safe to do so!

21:59.405 --> 22:01.711
Be on heightened
alert for sharks.

22:01.798 --> 22:04.540
Contact Marine Search
and Rescue if spotted.

22:04.627 --> 22:08.631
I repeat, all vessels must cease
in-water activity immediately!

22:51.718 --> 22:53.589
Do you want me to help?

22:53.676 --> 22:57.550
This one is kind of putting
a fight, but I think I got it.

22:57.637 --> 22:59.029
-You got it?
-Got it!

22:59.116 --> 22:59.987
No problem!

23:02.119 --> 23:03.469
She's got one?

23:03.556 --> 23:04.905
She's got one!

23:06.689 --> 23:08.038
Whoa!

23:08.125 --> 23:09.649
Looks like we got
a pro over here!

23:12.042 --> 23:13.783
Let's see, a really nice one!

23:13.870 --> 23:15.176
Woo!

23:18.527 --> 23:19.746
First catch of the day.
Now, who's next?

23:19.833 --> 23:21.574
Woo!

23:21.661 --> 23:23.097
Wow.

23:23.184 --> 23:24.620
I can't wait to tell my dad!

23:24.707 --> 23:26.753
I can fillet it up later
for you if you want

23:26.840 --> 23:27.754
or if you want
a mount or whatever.

23:27.841 --> 23:29.408
Not sure.

23:29.495 --> 23:31.366
I might catch a bigger one
with my next cast.

23:31.453 --> 23:34.978
-Okay.
-[Banning] I like that spirit!

23:57.784 --> 23:59.481
[reel spinning]

24:01.048 --> 24:02.049
Oh, my God.

24:03.006 --> 24:04.530
Oh, my God!

24:06.445 --> 24:07.794
All right, just stay calm.

24:07.881 --> 24:10.579
Go easy with it.

24:10.666 --> 24:11.972
Just start
to slowly bring it in.

24:12.059 --> 24:13.887
-Okay.
-Reel it in.

24:13.974 --> 24:15.715
The more you fight, the more the
fish will do the same, okay?

24:15.802 --> 24:17.760
Okay.
Wyatt, I caught a fish!

24:17.847 --> 24:18.848
You got a fish.

24:21.895 --> 24:23.505
-You got this, D.!
-Oh, my God.

24:23.592 --> 24:26.682
Looks like a lucky day
on the Jubilation!

24:26.769 --> 24:29.685
It usually takes about an hour
before we get the first bite.

24:29.772 --> 24:32.558
Just take it easy,
reel it in and pull.

24:32.645 --> 24:34.908
Reel and pull.

24:38.128 --> 24:40.566
Reel and pull!

24:40.653 --> 24:44.961
[All]
Reel and pull! Reel and pull!

25:03.414 --> 25:05.025
[gasps]

25:09.246 --> 25:11.466
Get her on the boat!

25:11.553 --> 25:15.165
Wyatt! Wyatt!

25:15.252 --> 25:17.037
I've got you, D.!

25:17.124 --> 25:20.562
Wyatt! Wyatt!

25:20.649 --> 25:22.695
Hold on!
Pull her back in the boat.

25:22.782 --> 25:24.087
Just hold on!

25:24.174 --> 25:25.175
Help me up, Wyatt!

25:27.787 --> 25:29.049
Wyatt!

25:30.877 --> 25:33.706
[muffled screams]

25:36.099 --> 25:39.799
[screaming]

25:39.886 --> 25:41.148
Here! Here!
This might help!

25:43.324 --> 25:44.717
Grab the net!

25:44.804 --> 25:46.719
Come on!

25:48.808 --> 25:50.810
Stop, stop!

25:52.899 --> 25:53.856
She's gone!

25:53.943 --> 25:56.729
No, no!

25:56.816 --> 25:59.645
I can't let her get away!

25:59.732 --> 26:01.168
Wyatt, no!

26:01.255 --> 26:02.952
[Wyatt] No! No!

26:03.039 --> 26:04.345
[sobs]

26:08.218 --> 26:10.786
I see it, it's right
by the motor!

26:12.179 --> 26:15.312
[engine revs, sputters]

26:17.619 --> 26:20.274
Out of my chair, Wyatt!
Out of my chair!

26:20.361 --> 26:22.581
I told you, I'm the only
one that pilots this ship!

26:22.668 --> 26:25.105
Cut the engine!

26:25.192 --> 26:26.889
We gotta keep moving!

26:26.976 --> 26:27.934
Cut the engine, Cap!
There's something wrong with it!

26:28.021 --> 26:28.935
We gotta get to shore!

26:29.022 --> 26:31.764
[engine sputtering]

26:31.851 --> 26:33.548
We've got to get to shore!

26:33.635 --> 26:35.202
We're gonna be
in major trouble if we don't!

26:35.289 --> 26:36.290
We're gonna be
in trouble if we do!

26:38.858 --> 26:39.772
-No!
-We've got to get Donna!

26:39.859 --> 26:41.208
She's gone!

26:41.295 --> 26:43.689
-We gotta do something!
-She's gone!

26:43.776 --> 26:45.212
-I gotta get Donna!
-She's gone, bro!

26:45.299 --> 26:47.606
-I gotta get Donna!
-She's gone!

26:47.693 --> 26:50.260
-Donna! Donna!
-Wyatt, she's gone!

26:50.347 --> 26:52.175
[engine sputter]

27:10.280 --> 27:11.717
Come on!

27:12.892 --> 27:14.197
Come on!

27:14.284 --> 27:15.895
[engine sputters]

27:19.159 --> 27:20.900
Ah!

27:28.821 --> 27:30.953
I'm sorry, Donna.

27:31.040 --> 27:32.999
I'm so sorry.

27:36.785 --> 27:38.091
You tried your best
to help her, bro.

27:39.266 --> 27:41.442
That's not gonna bring her back.

28:03.420 --> 28:06.336
Donna... She's gone.

28:06.423 --> 28:08.295
She's really gone, man.

28:11.254 --> 28:14.954
I had her in my hands and
she was just here a second ago.

28:17.173 --> 28:21.003
She didn't even want
to go on this fishing trip.

28:21.090 --> 28:22.701
She did it for me.

28:24.441 --> 28:29.229
We were supposed to go horseback
riding on the beach.

28:47.943 --> 28:49.379
I'm...

28:49.466 --> 28:51.077
I'm sorry.

28:51.164 --> 28:53.819
I mean this is horrible, I know.

28:56.517 --> 28:58.345
I'm sorry about Donna, Wyatt.

29:01.827 --> 29:04.220
We gotta figure out how
we can get back to shore.

29:06.396 --> 29:10.966
I mean, we've already
lost one passenger and...

29:11.053 --> 29:14.013
The shark's trashed our engine.

29:14.100 --> 29:16.232
Yeah?

29:16.319 --> 29:19.714
What are you gonna
do about it, huh, Captain?

29:19.801 --> 29:21.107
What's your plan?

29:25.372 --> 29:27.809
Wyatt, I think I can fix this.

29:27.896 --> 29:30.464
Let me get what's left
of the net.

29:50.049 --> 29:52.094
I gotta free up the engine
before she'll start.

29:52.181 --> 29:53.400
Shark's caught up in it.

29:56.577 --> 29:57.839
Not looking good, Cap.

30:00.059 --> 30:03.192
I don't know how we're
gonna get her operational.

30:03.279 --> 30:05.194
She's not gonna move like this.

30:19.861 --> 30:22.429
I see a problem I can fix.

30:22.516 --> 30:24.170
Let me help you there.

30:27.477 --> 30:28.870
Ah, hooked yourself, huh?

30:30.480 --> 30:31.917
It isn't the first time.

30:34.310 --> 30:37.183
You'd be surprised how
many hooks

30:37.270 --> 30:39.315
I've cut out of people
since I started this business.

30:44.451 --> 30:47.323
Okay, keep it steady,
keep it steady. Keep it steady.

30:47.410 --> 30:49.543
-Okay, okay.
-Keep it steady.

30:54.287 --> 30:57.246
Well, I had this one group
of kids

30:57.333 --> 30:59.161
that were casting their
poles like

30:59.248 --> 31:01.250
they were fly-fishing
on an open river.

31:04.297 --> 31:08.518
So this one kid whips
his pole back

31:08.605 --> 31:13.567
and the hook gets caught
in the scalp of the other kid

31:13.654 --> 31:17.179
behind him,
right there behind his ear.

31:17.266 --> 31:20.356
So the kid with the pole
just starts yanking

31:20.443 --> 31:23.098
like he thought his hook

31:23.185 --> 31:25.100
was stuck in a net
or something, I guess.

31:27.494 --> 31:31.324
So the other kid
behind him is...

31:31.411 --> 31:35.197
grabbing the hook out his scalp

31:35.284 --> 31:37.808
and just screaming,

31:37.896 --> 31:40.420
like, ahh!

31:42.204 --> 31:46.948
I tried to help,
but I just couldn't get

31:47.035 --> 31:50.517
to the back of
the stern fast enough.

31:51.953 --> 31:54.695
How did the kid take it,
removing the hook?

31:56.653 --> 31:59.395
Well...

31:59.482 --> 32:03.356
Let's just say you did
better than him, champ.

32:06.272 --> 32:07.447
Let me patch that up.

32:14.236 --> 32:15.498
Okay, keep it right there.

32:20.590 --> 32:21.722
Whoa.

32:23.593 --> 32:25.291
It's still alive?

32:31.558 --> 32:33.168
Shatto!
Get back!

32:35.692 --> 32:38.043
I got this.

32:40.393 --> 32:41.437
I don't want to be useless.

32:43.396 --> 32:44.658
All right. We can get out
of this

32:44.745 --> 32:46.007
if we work together, brother.

32:46.094 --> 32:48.053
-All right?
-All right, fine.

32:58.672 --> 33:00.369
[shouting]

33:02.328 --> 33:03.982
Dude!

33:04.069 --> 33:05.679
Antagonizing the shark
is not gonna help anything!

33:08.725 --> 33:10.162
Fine.

33:12.164 --> 33:13.687
What do you want me to do?

33:13.774 --> 33:15.471
Right now we have to focus
on getting the oar

33:15.558 --> 33:17.299
between the shark
and the engine.

33:17.386 --> 33:18.779
Can you do this?

33:20.433 --> 33:22.217
Yeah, yeah.

33:22.304 --> 33:23.436
Let's go!

33:25.525 --> 33:26.700
[grunting]

33:28.136 --> 33:30.530
Come on!
Get deep in there!

33:30.617 --> 33:32.053
You gotta get all
the way in there.

33:32.140 --> 33:33.272
I'm trying.

33:33.359 --> 33:34.708
Come on, push!

33:37.015 --> 33:39.234
Keep pushing!

33:39.321 --> 33:41.541
-It's moving, man!
-Keep going, keep going.

33:41.628 --> 33:42.759
It's moving!

33:47.764 --> 33:49.549
Oh, shit!

33:49.636 --> 33:51.725
Man overboard!
Get him the oar!

33:54.293 --> 33:55.772
Wyatt! Wyatt!

33:55.859 --> 33:56.817
Pull him in!

33:57.992 --> 33:59.559
Do you see him?

34:05.304 --> 34:06.609
He's over here!

34:09.221 --> 34:10.526
Get back into the boat!

34:10.613 --> 34:11.745
Wyatt, get out of
the water right now!

34:11.832 --> 34:13.051
Back here!
Come on, Wyatt!

34:13.138 --> 34:14.661
Get back to the boat!

34:26.325 --> 34:27.326
I'll kill you,
you piece of shit!

34:27.413 --> 34:28.457
Wyatt, listen to me!

34:28.544 --> 34:30.416
This will not bring her back!

34:30.503 --> 34:32.809
Wyatt, get out of the water
and get in the boat!

34:41.209 --> 34:42.732
Wyatt, get back in the boat!

34:42.819 --> 34:46.127
Hey, you guys see that?
I killed the shark!

34:48.521 --> 34:50.610
Wyatt! Look out!
There's another one!

34:58.705 --> 34:59.706
-Wyatt!
-Come on, Wyatt!

34:59.793 --> 35:01.708
-Swim!
-Faster!

35:05.320 --> 35:06.365
Wyatt!

35:17.854 --> 35:21.597
We gotta get
this engine sorted out.

35:21.684 --> 35:23.121
There's more of them.

35:26.254 --> 35:27.429
We gotta move, Captain.

35:36.177 --> 35:38.397
Three of them.

35:38.484 --> 35:39.920
Never seen them act
this way before.

35:40.964 --> 35:43.358
Probably desperate for food

35:43.445 --> 35:46.448
with the number of fish
being so low this year.

35:46.535 --> 35:47.493
Exactly.

35:47.580 --> 35:49.277
I mean, either we sit here

35:49.364 --> 35:51.323
and wait for them to come to us
or we get back to shore.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.675
Back to shore.

35:55.762 --> 35:57.546
I agree.

35:57.633 --> 36:00.158
Shatto, see if you can
get that engine fixed.

36:01.637 --> 36:02.769
On it, Captain.

36:07.556 --> 36:08.601
No luck, captain.

36:08.688 --> 36:10.559
It's pretty shot.

36:10.646 --> 36:12.605
I want to check the electrical
and see if that's the issue.

36:12.692 --> 36:16.565
Gotcha. And the radio signal
is being spotty.

36:17.610 --> 36:20.352
Any ideas?

36:20.439 --> 36:22.528
You know, I don't
bring my phone onboard.

36:22.615 --> 36:23.616
I got a phone.

36:26.271 --> 36:27.924
What's the emergency
number in Mexico?

36:29.317 --> 36:31.537
Same as it is in
the United States, kid.

36:31.624 --> 36:33.016
911.

36:33.103 --> 36:35.280
But good luck
with getting through.

36:35.367 --> 36:39.240
Fast response is
not their forte around here.

36:39.327 --> 36:41.416
I'll call my dad. He knows a lot
of people in the area

36:41.503 --> 36:42.504
who might be able to help.

36:46.726 --> 36:48.423
The reception is spotty but...

36:48.510 --> 36:50.295
I'll try to get through.

36:53.776 --> 36:55.213
No.

36:55.300 --> 36:56.736
What is it?

36:56.823 --> 36:58.477
Battery's low.

36:58.564 --> 37:00.348
Well, make this call count.

37:01.654 --> 37:02.959
It's ringing.

37:11.359 --> 37:13.405
Okay... okay.

37:13.492 --> 37:14.710
[phone rings]

37:14.797 --> 37:17.583
Oh...

37:17.670 --> 37:19.411
[sighs]

37:21.500 --> 37:22.762
Dad?

37:22.849 --> 37:24.677
Hey!

37:24.764 --> 37:26.548
You're back so soon, huh?

37:26.635 --> 37:29.203
Did the ocean run out of fish?

37:29.290 --> 37:30.596
Listen.

37:30.683 --> 37:32.772
There's been
a really bad accident.

37:32.859 --> 37:34.426
I'm okay, but...

37:37.864 --> 37:41.389
Two others fell off the boat

37:41.476 --> 37:46.655
and were eaten by sharks
and our engine just seized.

37:46.742 --> 37:48.657
Okay.

37:48.744 --> 37:52.313
Sharks...

37:52.400 --> 37:54.881
did you call
the Coast Guard, honey?

37:54.968 --> 37:56.535
Our radio was damaged
during the attack.

37:58.885 --> 38:02.497
They won't make it
out here in time, dad.

38:02.584 --> 38:05.370
We're dead in the water and
there are so many of them.

38:05.457 --> 38:06.806
There's so many sharks.

38:07.981 --> 38:10.723
Okay, okay, honey.
Stay calm, okay?

38:10.810 --> 38:14.770
I will relay the message to
my contacts down there, okay?

38:14.857 --> 38:16.946
What is your location?

38:17.033 --> 38:19.645
Uh..

38:19.732 --> 38:22.474
The coordinates are 22 degrees,
52 and 46 west,

38:22.561 --> 38:24.476
and 110 degrees, 3 and 22 north.

38:24.563 --> 38:25.999
Okay, okay.

38:26.086 --> 38:28.480
Stay on the line and

38:28.567 --> 38:30.656
I'm going to call my friends
on the landline...

38:30.743 --> 38:32.484
Dad, I can't.
My battery is low.

38:32.571 --> 38:33.920
I have to save the battery.

38:34.964 --> 38:37.315
Okay, so just sit tight.

38:37.402 --> 38:38.533
I've got this.

38:38.620 --> 38:41.580
I'll get someone
there soon, okay?

38:46.759 --> 38:49.501
I've never seen
so much blood before.

38:49.588 --> 38:51.894
Baby, baby, it's okay.

38:51.981 --> 38:56.029
I'll get the Coast Guard
there soon, okay?

38:56.116 --> 38:58.814
Look, you're safe
on that boat

38:58.901 --> 39:02.427
and you are the most comfortable
when you're on the water.

39:02.514 --> 39:03.906
Remember that, honey.

39:04.994 --> 39:06.735
Yes.

39:07.997 --> 39:10.043
You got this, you hear?

39:14.613 --> 39:15.701
Okay.

39:15.788 --> 39:17.006
Yeah, I can do this.

39:18.007 --> 39:20.358
Just... please hurry, dad.

39:21.576 --> 39:23.361
I love you.

39:23.448 --> 39:25.537
I love you too, Lucia.

39:32.108 --> 39:33.632
[sighs]

39:38.985 --> 39:40.813
Yes, hello.

39:40.900 --> 39:44.643
I am on land, but I am
relaying an emergency

39:44.730 --> 39:47.820
of a boat that is
stalled off the coast.

39:47.907 --> 39:49.909
Si, yes.

39:49.996 --> 39:54.435
And there's been two
fatalities... shark attacks.

39:56.045 --> 40:00.963
Could you please get me
with the Coast Guard, please?

40:01.050 --> 40:02.487
No, no, now!

40:02.574 --> 40:04.619
My daughter is in danger.

40:04.706 --> 40:07.579
No, no!
Don't put me on hold, please!

40:07.666 --> 40:09.972
You...!

40:12.584 --> 40:14.586
Oh...

40:32.647 --> 40:34.214
He's calling the Coast Guard.

40:35.868 --> 40:37.043
Someone will be here soon.

40:38.610 --> 40:40.786
How does that engine look?

40:40.873 --> 40:42.744
Bad news, cap.

40:42.831 --> 40:44.485
We got a few stripped gears.

40:46.008 --> 40:48.707
A little bit of a burnout,
but it's not fatal.

40:48.794 --> 40:51.144
I'm doubtful we can get
it up and running, though,

40:51.231 --> 40:53.581
without a total overhaul.

40:53.668 --> 40:57.150
Best to let it rest and
not risk a total flame-out.

40:57.237 --> 40:59.674
See what you can do
to get us going.

40:59.761 --> 41:01.241
Aye, aye, Cap.

41:13.471 --> 41:14.820
[Dad]
Okay, my daughter is out there.

41:14.907 --> 41:16.169
[Operator]
Sir, we're getting someone

41:16.256 --> 41:17.910
as soon as we can, okay?

41:17.997 --> 41:19.259
Okay, please hurry.

41:40.933 --> 41:46.025
So I said, "Wrecked 'em?
Damn near killed 'em!"

41:46.112 --> 41:47.853
That gets funnier
every time you tell it.

41:47.940 --> 41:49.463
Hey, come on,.
That's a classic.

41:49.550 --> 41:52.858
Try to get a new joke, Captain.

41:52.945 --> 41:54.599
Your phone's buzzing.

41:56.122 --> 41:57.471
Jose, old barnacle!

41:57.558 --> 41:58.864
When are you
gonna come down here?

41:58.951 --> 42:00.518
We'll tear up this port
like we used to.

42:00.605 --> 42:02.215
All right, Dan,
there's an emergency.

42:02.302 --> 42:05.218
Lucia took a fishing
cruise today

42:05.305 --> 42:08.874
and there's been
a couple fatalities.

42:08.961 --> 42:10.528
Is she okay?

42:10.615 --> 42:11.659
How can I help?

42:11.746 --> 42:14.053
Look, she's stranded

42:14.140 --> 42:17.491
and there have been some shark
attacks, a couple fatalities.

42:17.578 --> 42:19.188
And I called the Coast Guard,

42:19.275 --> 42:21.713
but God only knows when
they'll show up, right?

42:21.800 --> 42:23.802
Yeah, it'll be sundown
before they get there

42:23.889 --> 42:25.194
and that's if she's lucky.

42:25.281 --> 42:28.676
Is the Dew Drop up
and running yet?

42:28.763 --> 42:29.808
Give me a pen.

42:29.895 --> 42:31.766
No, no, she's in the shop.

42:31.853 --> 42:34.769
But I'll tell you what.
I can wrangle up something.

42:34.856 --> 42:37.642
Look, I'm sorry I couldn't get
her on the charter myself...

42:37.729 --> 42:40.035
No, no, no!
Don't be sorry.

42:40.122 --> 42:41.646
You can make it up to me
by getting me a boat

42:41.733 --> 42:42.734
as fast as you can
get me out there

42:42.821 --> 42:44.300
as fast as you can, please!

42:44.387 --> 42:46.781
No, I'm gonna get us
out there fast, okay?

42:46.868 --> 42:49.567
I'm not letting you alone out
at sea with that foot of yours.

42:49.654 --> 42:51.351
Now give me the coordinates.

42:54.963 --> 42:56.661
Okay, buddy.

42:56.748 --> 42:59.533
I promise you I'm gonna wrangle
up something, all right?

42:59.620 --> 43:01.274
We're gonna
get your little girl.

43:01.361 --> 43:04.669
I need to warn you, my friend,
there are sharks involved.

43:06.584 --> 43:07.976
It's never easy, is it?

43:08.063 --> 43:10.500
Well, we'll just have
to leave sooner

43:10.588 --> 43:12.285
than I thought, that's all.

43:12.372 --> 43:14.548
It'll be impossible
to find them once the sun sets.

43:14.635 --> 43:17.595
Thanks, Dan.
I owe you.

43:18.465 --> 43:19.771
I'm on it.

43:21.381 --> 43:23.122
Give me another coffee,
a big one.

43:28.040 --> 43:30.042
Okay.

43:30.129 --> 43:34.960
She's gonna be okay,
por favor, Jesus.

43:35.047 --> 43:36.744
She's going to be okay.

43:50.192 --> 43:51.803
We haven't moved
in such a long time.

43:51.890 --> 43:53.718
And all this blood splattered
against the boat,

43:53.805 --> 43:55.110
they probably think
we're another shark

43:55.197 --> 43:58.766
or a whale a.k.a. dinner.

43:58.853 --> 44:00.725
Yeah, I'm working as
fast as I can.

44:00.812 --> 44:02.944
This motor is still jammed.

44:03.031 --> 44:06.339
Once that sun goes down...

44:06.426 --> 44:08.428
I know, Cap, I know.

44:11.387 --> 44:12.911
How you holding up?

44:16.305 --> 44:18.786
Is that hand hurting you?

44:18.873 --> 44:20.788
Doesn't even hurt.

44:20.875 --> 44:23.312
I'm still running
off of adrenaline.

44:23.399 --> 44:25.663
I don't feel a thing.

44:25.750 --> 44:26.794
Good.

44:26.881 --> 44:28.666
Adrenalin's good.

44:28.753 --> 44:31.669
Keeps you alert, on your toes.

44:31.756 --> 44:33.279
So...

44:36.848 --> 44:37.936
We're gonna make
it out of this.

44:40.329 --> 44:42.723
Got it?

44:42.810 --> 44:44.203
Yep.

44:44.290 --> 44:46.684
Yeah, I know my
dad's gonna pull through.

44:46.771 --> 44:48.337
We'll put through.

44:48.424 --> 44:49.861
And you're gonna have
one hell of a fish tale

44:49.948 --> 44:51.732
to tell him when you see him.

45:02.351 --> 45:04.049
[gasps]

45:08.401 --> 45:09.881
On, no!

45:09.968 --> 45:12.013
We're taking in water!

45:12.100 --> 45:14.929
Oh my God.

45:15.016 --> 45:17.149
The hull can't keep taking
a beating like this, Cap.

45:17.236 --> 45:18.933
She'll break into pieces!

45:19.020 --> 45:20.892
It's just us out here!

45:20.979 --> 45:22.720
We don't have the luxury of
waiting for help to arrive!

45:24.939 --> 45:27.333
We need to find land...
and fast.

45:27.420 --> 45:28.726
And the wind is picking up.

45:28.813 --> 45:30.162
We'll be blown further out soon.

45:30.249 --> 45:34.166
No, no, that's
actually a good thing.

45:34.253 --> 45:36.037
We're drifting, so the wind
will point us

45:36.124 --> 45:38.823
into the direction of the
sandbar that we were at earlier.

45:38.910 --> 45:40.999
And that should
buy us some time.

45:41.086 --> 45:43.088
But we're gonna have to help
this old girl along

45:43.175 --> 45:44.176
if we're gonna make it out.

45:59.278 --> 46:00.801
We're gonna have to move!

46:00.888 --> 46:02.977
She's not gonna be
seaworthy much longer!

46:03.064 --> 46:05.066
Can we use the oars to paddle?

46:05.153 --> 46:06.241
We'll have to try.

46:06.328 --> 46:07.895
You start paddling.

46:07.982 --> 46:09.462
Try not to provoke the sharks.

46:09.549 --> 46:12.030
But give 'em a good whack
if you have to.

46:12.117 --> 46:14.075
-[grunting]
-There it is!

46:14.162 --> 46:15.381
The sandbar!

46:19.298 --> 46:20.560
[grunting]

46:23.998 --> 46:27.872
Put your backs into it, people!

46:27.959 --> 46:29.699
Keep on paddling!

46:29.787 --> 46:31.919
We're almost to the sandbar!

46:40.885 --> 46:41.886
[grunting]

46:44.105 --> 46:46.020
Aye, aye, Captain!

46:53.245 --> 46:54.376
We hit ground!

46:58.859 --> 47:00.382
Nice job, crew.

47:03.603 --> 47:05.431
So I don't think
we're gonna sink for a bit.

47:09.087 --> 47:10.915
Thanks, Cap.

47:11.002 --> 47:13.047
I think it'll be too shallow
for the sharks here,

47:13.134 --> 47:16.181
but they are smart creatures,
so we need to be careful.

47:16.268 --> 47:19.880
But we've only bought ourselves,
you know, a little bit of time.

47:19.967 --> 47:23.101
We're already on
the high end of an ebb and flow.

47:31.544 --> 47:33.807
It doesn't seem
like they're leaving.

47:33.894 --> 47:36.984
We can only hope that they
get bored, but I doubt it.

47:37.071 --> 47:39.117
We're gonna be easy pickings
at high tide.

47:42.990 --> 47:44.252
There...

47:44.339 --> 47:45.427
There.

47:45.514 --> 47:47.038
It's a boat!

47:47.125 --> 47:48.213
Our luck's 'turned around!

47:49.910 --> 47:51.346
Hey!

47:53.044 --> 47:54.915
Hey!

47:55.002 --> 47:56.569
Help!

48:00.225 --> 48:04.533
Hey! Help, over here!

48:04.620 --> 48:06.492
[shouting]

48:07.493 --> 48:10.452
Help!
Over here!

48:10.539 --> 48:13.586
The sky's too bright.
They can't see the flare.

48:13.673 --> 48:17.198
They can't hear us either.
Engine's too loud.

48:18.243 --> 48:21.855
Hey!
Over here!

48:21.942 --> 48:23.726
Hey!

48:27.556 --> 48:28.993
[screams]

48:30.342 --> 48:32.170
Hurry, stand up!

48:32.257 --> 48:33.475
You can stand on the sandbar!

48:34.999 --> 48:36.522
Mayday!

48:36.609 --> 48:38.350
Can anyone hear me?

48:38.437 --> 48:39.917
Mayday!

48:51.450 --> 48:53.539
[screams]

48:53.626 --> 48:56.063
-Shatto!
-Lucia!

48:56.150 --> 48:57.325
Come here!

48:58.326 --> 49:00.546
-Lucia!
-Shatto!

49:00.633 --> 49:02.374
I'm coming!

49:03.679 --> 49:05.203
[shouts]

49:14.386 --> 49:16.518
[groans]

49:19.478 --> 49:21.349
[crying]

49:29.705 --> 49:31.577
[groaning]

49:33.579 --> 49:36.321
Come on, baby.
Come on.

49:36.408 --> 49:37.713
Watch her legs.

49:39.585 --> 49:41.717
Come on, move, Shatto!
I got you!

49:46.722 --> 49:48.898
[groaning]

49:48.986 --> 49:50.335
We're gonna have to put

49:50.422 --> 49:53.294
a tourniquet on
this wound, pronto!

49:53.381 --> 49:55.514
How bad is it?

49:57.298 --> 49:58.604
I'm not gonna lie to you, kid.

49:58.691 --> 50:00.432
Getting bit by
a shark is not good.

50:02.651 --> 50:04.436
It hurts.

50:07.091 --> 50:09.310
Tell me...tell me something.

50:09.397 --> 50:11.617
Listen to me, listen to me.

50:11.704 --> 50:14.185
Eyes up here to me!
Eyes up here to me!

50:14.272 --> 50:15.273
Eyes up here to me, kid.

50:15.360 --> 50:17.971
Tell me something.

50:18.058 --> 50:19.059
Why do you like to fish?

50:20.278 --> 50:21.931
Wh-what?

50:22.019 --> 50:24.151
Why do you like to fish, Lucia?

50:24.238 --> 50:25.587
Why do you like to fish?

50:28.634 --> 50:32.768
Because it's as simple
as life can get for you.

50:34.379 --> 50:36.250
It's, uh... oh!

50:36.337 --> 50:38.557
Yeah, come on.
Come on, baby girl, come on.

50:38.644 --> 50:41.647
It's...it's one person

50:41.734 --> 50:45.390
and one fish with a
thin line between you.

50:47.131 --> 50:50.743
And sometimes...

50:50.830 --> 50:54.486
you make that cast
and you make that connection

50:54.573 --> 50:59.012
and sometimes you don't.

50:59.099 --> 51:01.580
There's no wiggle
room in between.

51:04.322 --> 51:08.108
Life doesn't...

51:08.195 --> 51:11.416
Life doesn't really offer up
that many absolutes like that.

51:11.503 --> 51:13.635
Yeah, I like that.

51:13.722 --> 51:19.685
It's like you get the fish or
the fish gets you, right?

51:19.772 --> 51:23.689
Plus, it give me more time
to spend with my dad.

51:27.171 --> 51:29.086
Come on, come on!

51:30.826 --> 51:34.439
When...

51:34.526 --> 51:40.227
After my mom passed, we both
felt like were on borrowed time.

51:41.359 --> 51:44.449
And we were terrified
that something

51:44.536 --> 51:46.320
would just come along
and tear us apart.

51:48.322 --> 51:49.976
Yeah, yeah.

51:50.063 --> 51:52.326
I actually lost my mother
when I was young, too.

51:52.413 --> 51:54.676
And it's not something you
ever really get over.

51:58.680 --> 51:59.725
I can't die out here.

51:59.812 --> 52:01.292
No, no, no, no.

52:01.379 --> 52:02.684
I can't leave my dad alone.

52:02.771 --> 52:04.730
No, no, not today,
kid, not today.

52:04.817 --> 52:06.210
You're not dying on me,
not today.

52:06.297 --> 52:08.473
It's not gonna happen, okay?

52:08.560 --> 52:11.171
You'll be fishing with
your father again real soon.

52:12.694 --> 52:14.305
Hey, hey.

52:14.392 --> 52:17.134
It just mouthed you,
Lucia, okay?

52:17.221 --> 52:18.352
Barely a bite.

52:20.224 --> 52:21.921
You hear that?

52:22.008 --> 52:23.749
Just took a little gnaw at you,
just a little gnaw.

52:26.186 --> 52:28.493
Even though,
a little bite from a shark

52:28.580 --> 52:30.408
is still a pretty big bite.

52:30.495 --> 52:32.236
Not helping, Shatto.

52:35.239 --> 52:37.676
You must taste like crap, kid.

52:37.763 --> 52:40.331
He took a bite out of you
and just spit you right out.

52:40.418 --> 52:42.942
There's so much blood, though.

52:44.770 --> 52:48.600
I wanna call my dad.
I wanna call my dad.

52:48.687 --> 52:50.950
Just sit up.
Sit up.

52:55.650 --> 52:56.695
No!

52:56.782 --> 53:00.351
My phone is missing!

53:00.438 --> 53:02.788
My bag must have been torn,
it's ruined.

53:02.875 --> 53:05.660
Come on, sit back, sit back.

53:05.747 --> 53:07.184
[panting]

53:15.366 --> 53:17.455
I can't die out here.

53:18.978 --> 53:20.806
I need you to breathe.

53:20.893 --> 53:24.549
Don't over exert yourself.

53:24.636 --> 53:26.464
I need you to breathe.
I need you to breathe.

53:26.551 --> 53:28.161
Come on, breathe.

53:28.248 --> 53:29.945
There you go.

53:32.339 --> 53:34.863
She's gonna go into shock.
We can't lose her.

53:34.950 --> 53:37.344
She's a soldier.

53:37.431 --> 53:39.216
She's not gonna make
it much longer, man,

53:39.303 --> 53:41.130
if we don't hurry
to get her help.

53:41.218 --> 53:43.698
We got about a couple of hours.

53:43.785 --> 53:45.265
Yeah, that's a lot of blood.

53:45.352 --> 53:48.573
Just need you to keep
the tourniquet tight

53:48.660 --> 53:50.183
and make sure
it doesn't loosen up.

53:50.270 --> 53:53.578
All Right. I'll do what
I can to keep her awake.

53:53.665 --> 53:55.188
Thank you.

53:55.275 --> 53:57.843
Time is really working
against us.

54:36.708 --> 54:40.668
[speaking Spanish]

54:55.074 --> 54:58.207
S.O.S. from a fishing vessel,
shark attack, two casualties.

54:58.295 --> 54:59.252
Copy.

54:59.339 --> 55:00.645
Where's the vessel?

55:00.732 --> 55:02.255
[TK421] What's your location?

55:02.342 --> 55:03.691
Officer Fuentes told us
to reach out to you

55:03.778 --> 55:05.302
for possible assistance.

55:05.389 --> 55:07.652
Well, a couple of miles
south of Cabo San Lucas.

55:07.739 --> 55:09.436
Scanning the shoreline
for sharks.

55:09.523 --> 55:10.481
I'm already following
one shiver.

55:10.568 --> 55:12.004
Where do you need me to be?

55:12.091 --> 55:13.658
[TK421] Should get a visual
on them shortly.

55:13.745 --> 55:16.356
Then we'll give you
exact coordinates.

55:16.443 --> 55:18.489
Roger that.
Keep me posted.

55:18.576 --> 55:19.664
Stay safe.

55:22.797 --> 55:24.408
All right.

55:24.495 --> 55:27.498
I need everyone to contact
every vessel they can.

55:27.585 --> 55:31.458
Find out if anybody saw anything
regarding that jet ski attack.

55:31.545 --> 55:34.679
And find out if anybody knows
anything about the Jubilation.

55:41.425 --> 55:42.774
Come on, Lucia!

55:44.428 --> 55:45.733
See anything?

55:45.820 --> 55:48.301
No.

55:48.388 --> 55:49.694
It's clear seas.

55:53.611 --> 55:55.090
Can't this thing
go any faster, Dan?

55:55.177 --> 55:58.572
It's all I could get
on such short notice.

55:58.659 --> 56:00.531
It's not a speedster,
but it floats.

56:02.620 --> 56:05.536
Well, look at that!

56:05.623 --> 56:07.059
It looks like the Guard's have
finally gotten off their butts

56:07.146 --> 56:09.931
and doing their job!

56:10.018 --> 56:12.412
TK-421.

56:18.026 --> 56:20.289
TK-421!

56:20.377 --> 56:21.987
[speaking Spanish]

56:28.123 --> 56:30.387
TK-421!

56:32.476 --> 56:34.826
[speaking Spanish]

56:52.800 --> 56:54.976
Didn't they send a chopper?

56:56.848 --> 56:59.590
[speaking Spanish]

57:12.951 --> 57:15.170
[speaking Spanish]

57:25.224 --> 57:27.705
Try to catch up with them!

57:27.792 --> 57:29.576
I'll try. They're a heck
of a lot faster

57:29.663 --> 57:31.665
than this old floater.

57:31.752 --> 57:33.362
Good news that the
Guard's out looking for 'em.

57:33.450 --> 57:35.060
Si.

57:35.147 --> 57:36.888
We're gonna find her, my friend.

57:40.544 --> 57:41.806
I can't keep up with them,

57:41.893 --> 57:44.156
but eventually we'll
catch up to 'em.

57:47.812 --> 57:49.727
Thank you, Dan.

57:49.814 --> 57:52.164
I appreciate you doing this.

57:52.251 --> 57:54.993
I owe you one, my friend.

57:55.080 --> 57:56.734
Hey, you and your daughter
just have dinner with me

57:56.821 --> 57:58.170
when this is all over.

57:58.257 --> 57:59.650
And then we'll call
it even, right?

57:59.737 --> 58:01.260
You got yourself a deal.

58:03.567 --> 58:04.698
She's gonna be okay, my friend.

58:08.920 --> 58:10.008
[Banning] Eventually the tide
will get high enough

58:10.095 --> 58:12.010
to pull us off the reef.

58:12.097 --> 58:14.447
We don't have much time before
the boat starts to sink again.

58:14.534 --> 58:16.144
How's Lucia?

58:16.231 --> 58:17.972
[Shatto] She's good.

58:18.059 --> 58:21.193
She's stopped bleeding for now.
Her color's coming back.

58:21.280 --> 58:22.281
You know I can hear you.

58:22.368 --> 58:25.240
Man, stop being a big ass baby.

58:25.327 --> 58:26.677
You're going to
run out of bandages, you know.

58:29.157 --> 58:30.898
Got plenty.

58:30.985 --> 58:33.118
But you are gonna be
looking like a few mummies

58:33.205 --> 58:34.598
in a little while.

58:35.773 --> 58:37.209
[chuckles]

58:38.863 --> 58:42.214
Lucia, wake up, please.

58:42.301 --> 58:45.043
Can't have you falling asleep
until we get some help.

58:50.265 --> 58:51.919
You okay?

58:52.006 --> 58:55.053
Um, yeah.

58:55.140 --> 58:56.620
Actually, I'm the only one

58:56.707 --> 58:59.927
that's not cut up
or bit, aren't I?

59:00.014 --> 59:01.581
Yeah, but you should rest.

59:01.668 --> 59:03.148
I mean, you're taking
care of everybody.

59:03.235 --> 59:05.803
It's the captain's job,
my friend.

59:08.719 --> 59:11.025
Hey!

59:11.112 --> 59:13.680
Get up! We can't have you
falling asleep, Lucia.

59:13.767 --> 59:15.160
On your feet, soldier.

59:18.250 --> 59:19.599
On your feet!

59:23.168 --> 59:25.736
Okay, okay, I'm up, I'm up.

59:25.823 --> 59:28.086
Try not to put any
weight on your leg.

59:28.173 --> 59:31.045
You can prop it up
if you need to, okay?

59:31.132 --> 59:33.831
I'm gonna go below deck to see
if I can find something to help.

59:38.705 --> 59:40.664
You care about
him a lot, don't you?

59:42.056 --> 59:44.798
Yeah.

59:44.885 --> 59:49.542
When I first came here from
Hawaii, I didn't know anybody.

59:49.629 --> 59:53.590
Captain took me in when nobody
else would, gave me a job,

59:53.677 --> 59:55.200
taught me all about this boat,

59:55.287 --> 59:57.028
and gave my life purpose

59:57.115 --> 59:58.638
when it didn't have any.

1:00:00.771 --> 1:00:02.207
Kind of like you said.

1:00:03.861 --> 1:00:05.689
Life doesn't give
you many absolutes.

1:00:07.342 --> 1:00:09.040
So the captain
is your absolute.

1:00:13.218 --> 1:00:15.960
Well, I absolutely
wouldn't be here without him,

1:00:16.047 --> 1:00:19.050
for better or worse.

1:00:19.137 --> 1:00:23.228
He helped me, so I'd
do anything to help him.

1:00:23.315 --> 1:00:25.796
If you sad sacks
stop talking about me,

1:00:25.883 --> 1:00:28.842
maybe I can give you
a perfect update.

1:00:28.929 --> 1:00:33.847
Water's filling up
quickly below in the deck.

1:00:33.934 --> 1:00:37.155
This means that we have to
jump on the offense situation.

1:00:37.242 --> 1:00:40.332
Now these sharks
are beautiful creatures.

1:00:42.377 --> 1:00:44.162
Massive monsters,

1:00:44.249 --> 1:00:48.688
who survived on sheer grit
throughout the millennium.

1:00:48.775 --> 1:00:51.865
As much as I know
that we like to marvel

1:00:51.952 --> 1:00:54.520
at these perfect relics
in their natural habitat,

1:00:54.607 --> 1:00:57.175
we gotta realize that
they're trying to end us.

1:00:57.262 --> 1:01:02.659
Now, personally, I'm not
trying to get ended yet.

1:01:02.746 --> 1:01:06.532
Now we don't know when
the Coast Guard is coming.

1:01:06.619 --> 1:01:08.882
So we have to do something.

1:01:10.841 --> 1:01:12.581
So we fight back.

1:01:12.669 --> 1:01:14.888
Exactly.

1:01:14.975 --> 1:01:16.803
Now the water's still shallow,

1:01:16.890 --> 1:01:19.371
so that means we'll see the
sharks when they get close.

1:01:19.458 --> 1:01:23.375
Now when they do,
we let 'em have it.

1:01:25.116 --> 1:01:27.335
You use that thing
a lot out on the ocean?

1:01:27.422 --> 1:01:29.337
What? This right here?

1:01:29.424 --> 1:01:31.731
More than you know.

1:01:31.818 --> 1:01:34.473
Used for customers
who don't pay me.

1:01:36.823 --> 1:01:40.000
Don't worry.
Your credit card went through.

1:01:49.053 --> 1:01:50.184
I got one!

1:01:50.271 --> 1:01:51.403
Starboard side!

1:01:55.929 --> 1:01:57.365
Come on, what
are you waiting for?

1:02:01.152 --> 1:02:02.414
Ah...

1:02:06.331 --> 1:02:10.291
Better be careful!
Those aren't dolphins!

1:02:10.378 --> 1:02:11.902
Come on, come on.

1:02:13.294 --> 1:02:15.122
Shatto, watch out!

1:02:15.209 --> 1:02:16.994
[grunts]

1:02:23.261 --> 1:02:26.090
[sighs]

1:02:26.177 --> 1:02:27.918
-That's my first mate.
-Yes, sir.

1:02:32.096 --> 1:02:37.057
Yeah. Great job, crew, but
the tide is still rising fast.

1:02:37.144 --> 1:02:39.233
We're still taking in water

1:02:39.320 --> 1:02:41.018
and we still haven't
gotten any help.

1:02:41.105 --> 1:02:44.238
So we're not out
of the hot water yet.

1:02:44.325 --> 1:02:47.198
Lucia, you definitely
need some medical attention

1:02:47.285 --> 1:02:48.416
as soon as possible.

1:02:48.503 --> 1:02:50.767
I'll be fine.

1:02:50.854 --> 1:02:52.246
Lucia? Lucia!

1:02:52.333 --> 1:02:54.858
-Lucia!
-Lucia, wake up!

1:02:54.945 --> 1:02:56.207
Wake up, kid!

1:02:56.294 --> 1:02:58.252
We can't let her go into shock!

1:03:05.259 --> 1:03:09.220
[Shatto] The tourniquet is still
holding, she should be good.

1:03:11.135 --> 1:03:13.485
Lucia, wake up, kid.

1:03:16.444 --> 1:03:17.532
Wake up.

1:03:18.533 --> 1:03:20.057
Lucia?

1:03:20.144 --> 1:03:21.406
Lucia!

1:03:21.493 --> 1:03:22.929
Lucia, wake up!

1:03:23.016 --> 1:03:24.235
Wake up, kid.

1:03:24.322 --> 1:03:25.845
Lucia?
Wake up, kid.

1:03:28.021 --> 1:03:30.284
You fainted on me, kid.

1:03:30.371 --> 1:03:33.070
I did?

1:03:33.157 --> 1:03:35.246
Yeah, too much excitement,
I guess.

1:03:35.333 --> 1:03:37.814
It's okay,
I'm good, I'm good.

1:03:37.901 --> 1:03:39.946
Here.
Take a swig of this.

1:03:40.033 --> 1:03:42.296
Fighting off hungry sharks
can make you thirsty.

1:03:42.383 --> 1:03:44.516
I'm gonna go clean some
shark blood off of the boat.

1:03:57.572 --> 1:03:59.357
Get off!

1:04:05.145 --> 1:04:07.278
Give it back!

1:04:14.459 --> 1:04:15.416
Give it back!

1:04:15.503 --> 1:04:17.244
He's gonna yank you under

1:04:17.331 --> 1:04:18.855
if you don't just drop
that bucket in the water.

1:04:18.942 --> 1:04:20.117
Yah!

1:04:25.122 --> 1:04:26.645
I hate these sharks!

1:04:33.217 --> 1:04:35.480
Once the water
lifts us off the sandbar,

1:04:35.567 --> 1:04:37.221
we'll be targets again.

1:04:39.179 --> 1:04:41.051
We'll float a bit, but we're
taking in so much water

1:04:41.138 --> 1:04:42.530
that those sharks
will practically be able

1:04:42.617 --> 1:04:44.228
to jump on the boat with us.

1:04:44.315 --> 1:04:46.056
It's just a matter of time.

1:04:50.669 --> 1:04:52.889
Am I dreaming or is that a boat?

1:04:55.630 --> 1:04:57.545
That's a boat.

1:04:57.632 --> 1:04:59.417
The Coast Guard.

1:05:04.161 --> 1:05:06.641
Hey!
S.O.S.! Over here!

1:05:08.905 --> 1:05:12.691
[speaks Spanish]

1:05:19.698 --> 1:05:20.568
Over here!

1:05:20.655 --> 1:05:21.482
-Help!
-Hey!

1:05:21.569 --> 1:05:23.920
Over here!

1:05:24.007 --> 1:05:26.444
-Hey, over here!
-Over here, help!

1:05:26.531 --> 1:05:28.185
Hey, over here!

1:05:28.272 --> 1:05:31.275
[speaks Spanish]

1:05:36.933 --> 1:05:38.630
Hey, I think we're saved!

1:05:38.717 --> 1:05:39.848
I think we're saved!

1:05:39.936 --> 1:05:41.372
[speaking Spanish]

1:06:09.008 --> 1:06:10.488
[speaks Spanish]

1:06:14.144 --> 1:06:16.102
Go grab your stuff!
Lucia, grab your stuff!

1:06:16.189 --> 1:06:17.625
Shatto, just grab
the essentials!

1:06:17.712 --> 1:06:18.931
Yes, yes!

1:06:19.018 --> 1:06:22.021
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1:06:22.108 --> 1:06:24.415
That doesn't look like any Coast
Guard vessel I've ever seen.

1:06:24.502 --> 1:06:27.157
What?
It's got to be.

1:06:27.244 --> 1:06:29.681
Well, you're right.

1:06:29.768 --> 1:06:32.510
It's definitely
not the Coast Guard.

1:06:32.597 --> 1:06:34.425
I don't care who it is.
We're saved.

1:06:37.210 --> 1:06:38.255
Wait a second.

1:06:40.431 --> 1:06:43.086
That's...

1:06:43.173 --> 1:06:44.957
That's my dad!

1:06:45.044 --> 1:06:48.134
That's my dad! Dad!

1:06:48.221 --> 1:06:49.788
That's them!

1:06:57.361 --> 1:06:58.797
Chopper One, do you copy?

1:06:58.884 --> 1:07:00.712
Go for Chopper One.

1:07:00.799 --> 1:07:04.542
TK-421 is having trouble
locating the vessel.

1:07:04.629 --> 1:07:06.370
Do a perimeter search
five miles out

1:07:06.457 --> 1:07:08.285
and see if you
can spot anything.

1:07:08.372 --> 1:07:10.635
Roger that, Office Fuentes.
I'm on my way.

1:07:12.550 --> 1:07:15.205
Did you get a call sign
or a name of the vessel?

1:07:15.292 --> 1:07:16.336
We did.

1:07:16.423 --> 1:07:18.077
The initial report says...

1:07:18.164 --> 1:07:20.993
and we just confirmed...
it's called the Jubilation.

1:07:21.080 --> 1:07:23.648
-The Jubilation?
-That's correct.

1:07:23.735 --> 1:07:25.171
Are you sure?

1:07:25.258 --> 1:07:27.565
100%. Why?

1:07:27.652 --> 1:07:29.480
I was on that boat
a couple of weeks ago.

1:07:29.567 --> 1:07:32.048
I caught the biggest fish.

1:07:32.135 --> 1:07:34.224
All the more reason for
you to find that vessel.

1:07:34.311 --> 1:07:36.226
With food harder to find,

1:07:36.313 --> 1:07:39.359
those sharks won't hesitate
to attack a boat full of fish.

1:07:39.446 --> 1:07:41.405
I'll search as fast as I can.

1:07:41.492 --> 1:07:43.320
All right, good.

1:07:43.407 --> 1:07:45.104
You update me if
you find anything.

1:07:45.191 --> 1:07:48.238
And Davila,
didn't know you fished.

1:07:48.325 --> 1:07:49.978
You never asked.

1:07:50.066 --> 1:07:53.112
I go out with Captain Banning
a few times a year.

1:07:53.199 --> 1:07:55.680
I just don't know why
it had to be the Jubilation.

1:07:55.767 --> 1:07:57.290
I mean, Banning's one of

1:07:57.377 --> 1:07:58.987
the most respectful
captains out there.

1:07:59.075 --> 1:08:00.511
Really?

1:08:00.598 --> 1:08:02.208
Like he even took
in his first mate

1:08:02.295 --> 1:08:03.688
when he had nowhere else to go.

1:08:03.775 --> 1:08:05.298
Man, I hope he's okay out there.

1:08:05.385 --> 1:08:07.387
Do you have any idea
where he could be?

1:08:07.474 --> 1:08:10.129
Anything at all that could
help us locate that vessel?

1:08:10.216 --> 1:08:12.784
Well, normally, Banning
sticks closer to the shore.

1:08:12.871 --> 1:08:15.395
But the fish are moving out
further out these days.

1:08:15.482 --> 1:08:18.398
So this one time,
he took us to the sandbar.

1:08:18.485 --> 1:08:21.227
Man, the fish were
jumping into the boat.

1:08:21.314 --> 1:08:23.708
It was like... that was
the best day of my life.

1:08:23.795 --> 1:08:25.797
Do you remember
where this sandbar is?

1:08:25.884 --> 1:08:28.365
I know exactly where
that sandbar is.

1:08:28.452 --> 1:08:29.714
Heading that way now.

1:08:37.461 --> 1:08:38.636
Lucia!

1:08:38.723 --> 1:08:40.464
-Dad!
-Lucia!

1:08:40.551 --> 1:08:42.553
Dad!

1:08:42.640 --> 1:08:44.076
They don't know
about the sandbar.

1:08:44.163 --> 1:08:45.382
Over here!

1:08:45.469 --> 1:08:48.124
Lucia, are you guys okay?

1:08:48.211 --> 1:08:51.127
Stop!

1:08:51.214 --> 1:08:53.477
There's a sandbar over there!

1:08:55.218 --> 1:08:56.480
Oh, no. Dad, please stop!

1:08:56.567 --> 1:08:57.611
Dad, please stop!

1:08:57.698 --> 1:09:00.484
I think they want us to stop.

1:09:00.571 --> 1:09:01.833
Why stop?

1:09:01.920 --> 1:09:03.269
Stop the boat!
Stop the boat!

1:09:03.356 --> 1:09:05.097
Watch out, brother!

1:09:05.184 --> 1:09:06.794
Some extremely
hostile sharks over here!

1:09:09.928 --> 1:09:13.149
The first thing I need
to know, are you okay?

1:09:13.236 --> 1:09:15.281
We have one severely injured!

1:09:15.368 --> 1:09:18.415
We need to get her some medical
assistance in the boat ASAP!

1:09:18.502 --> 1:09:21.679
Dad, I'm okay!
Dad, I'm okay!

1:09:21.766 --> 1:09:26.205
Lucia, baby
why are you bleeding?

1:09:26.292 --> 1:09:27.902
She's okay!

1:09:27.989 --> 1:09:30.340
She just needs medical attention
to get in the boat!

1:09:30.427 --> 1:09:31.602
Dad, I'm okay!

1:09:31.689 --> 1:09:35.258
I was just bit.
I'm fine.

1:09:35.345 --> 1:09:37.129
Is that Uncle Dan?

1:09:37.216 --> 1:09:40.785
-Uncle Dan?
-He's a friend of my dad's.

1:09:44.397 --> 1:09:45.790
Hold on, Lucia!

1:09:45.877 --> 1:09:46.878
We'll be over there
in a quick minute!

1:09:46.965 --> 1:09:48.140
We're coming, baby!

1:09:48.227 --> 1:09:49.315
No! No, Dad, no!

1:09:49.402 --> 1:09:50.316
Wait!

1:09:50.403 --> 1:09:52.144
If you come any closer,

1:09:52.231 --> 1:09:53.232
you'll be trapped on
the sandbar just like we are!

1:09:53.319 --> 1:09:55.365
Dude, stop!

1:09:55.452 --> 1:09:57.193
Stop or you're gonna get stuck!

1:09:57.280 --> 1:09:59.369
Back off.
Okay, okay sit tight!

1:09:59.456 --> 1:10:01.632
Slow down, slow down.

1:10:05.157 --> 1:10:07.028
Why are they so aggressive?

1:10:07.115 --> 1:10:10.510
These waters... they've been
chummed up by some dead sharks!

1:10:10.597 --> 1:10:12.860
Dad, they've already
eaten two people

1:10:12.947 --> 1:10:14.297
and they're still hungry, okay?

1:10:14.384 --> 1:10:15.820
They won't leave us alone!

1:10:15.907 --> 1:10:17.213
You gotta get us out of here!

1:10:17.300 --> 1:10:18.910
Okay, okay!

1:10:18.997 --> 1:10:20.651
Just hold on and let me see
what we got in the boat!

1:10:20.738 --> 1:10:24.307
What do we got, Danny?
Do we have something?

1:10:24.394 --> 1:10:26.483
What do we got in here, Dan?

1:10:26.570 --> 1:10:27.484
We got this!

1:10:27.571 --> 1:10:29.529
Okay! Okay.

1:10:31.749 --> 1:10:33.577
I'm going to throw you this rope

1:10:33.664 --> 1:10:36.841
and you tie it
to the bow, okay?

1:10:37.972 --> 1:10:40.497
And we pull you off the sandbar!

1:10:41.933 --> 1:10:44.501
Got it!

1:10:44.588 --> 1:10:45.676
Attaboy.

1:10:46.677 --> 1:10:47.765
Okay, tie it to the bow!

1:10:53.771 --> 1:10:55.947
How's your motor working?

1:10:56.034 --> 1:10:58.950
It's dead, but if you
pull us hard enough,

1:10:59.037 --> 1:11:00.778
we'll get closer to you.

1:11:00.865 --> 1:11:02.258
But you gotta do it quickly

1:11:02.345 --> 1:11:03.607
'cause there's a
hole in the hull

1:11:03.694 --> 1:11:05.696
and we're pulling
in a lot of water!

1:11:05.783 --> 1:11:09.221
Secure the rope to the boat!

1:11:09.308 --> 1:11:11.702
Okay, on my signal, Dan, okay?

1:11:11.789 --> 1:11:13.573
Hold tight, baby.

1:11:13.660 --> 1:11:14.922
Daddy's gonna get
you out of here.

1:11:15.009 --> 1:11:16.402
Papi's coming!

1:11:16.489 --> 1:11:18.186
You better do it quick!

1:11:18.274 --> 1:11:20.363
This boat's being held together
by a lick and a promise!

1:11:24.845 --> 1:11:25.977
Now!

1:11:29.459 --> 1:11:31.591
[chatters]

1:11:33.898 --> 1:11:36.074
Come on, you little dinghy!
You can do it!

1:11:38.816 --> 1:11:40.296
It's no use!

1:11:40.383 --> 1:11:41.471
It's really wedged in there!

1:11:43.908 --> 1:11:46.476
We've gotta get
off this boat, Dad!

1:11:46.563 --> 1:11:47.390
We're too heavy!

1:11:48.652 --> 1:11:51.829
I got a plan, Cap.

1:11:51.916 --> 1:11:54.092
I'll jump out,
dislodge the front of the ship.

1:11:56.921 --> 1:11:58.966
No! Shatto, no.
That's suicide!

1:11:59.053 --> 1:12:00.577
There's sharks still out there!

1:12:02.709 --> 1:12:03.928
No. No way.

1:12:04.015 --> 1:12:05.495
We've lost too much today.

1:12:05.582 --> 1:12:07.018
And I'm not losing you, brother.

1:12:07.105 --> 1:12:08.933
There's gotta be another option.

1:12:10.413 --> 1:12:11.805
You know there isn't.

1:12:11.892 --> 1:12:13.633
Shatto, I can't ask you to...

1:12:13.720 --> 1:12:16.332
I'm gonna do it whether you give
me permission or not, Captain.

1:12:18.856 --> 1:12:21.902
Look, the boat will be
lighter with me off it anyway.

1:12:21.989 --> 1:12:24.775
And, look, you can distract them
on the other side with this.

1:12:30.084 --> 1:12:31.782
All right.

1:12:31.869 --> 1:12:33.827
We'll use both.

1:12:33.914 --> 1:12:37.614
It might work,
but you better move fast.

1:12:37.701 --> 1:12:39.790
Aye, aye, Captain.

1:12:39.877 --> 1:12:41.531
You hear me?

1:12:41.618 --> 1:12:43.359
And I do mean fast!

1:12:45.535 --> 1:12:46.623
Aye, captain.

1:13:02.639 --> 1:13:04.162
What's going on?

1:13:05.642 --> 1:13:08.079
We've got a plan!

1:13:08.166 --> 1:13:11.082
Just make sure when
I give you the signal,

1:13:11.169 --> 1:13:12.562
you fire up your engine!

1:13:18.002 --> 1:13:20.396
Trust me, captain.

1:13:20.483 --> 1:13:21.484
I can do this.

1:13:24.530 --> 1:13:26.402
That's my little girl
over there!

1:13:26.489 --> 1:13:28.578
Hey, it's gonna work, buddy.

1:13:31.189 --> 1:13:33.887
You ready for one last cast?

1:13:33.974 --> 1:13:35.846
I'm ready.

1:13:35.933 --> 1:13:37.587
Okay, Shatto. Ready!

1:13:45.899 --> 1:13:47.118
Hey!

1:13:51.427 --> 1:13:53.603
[grunting]

1:14:04.091 --> 1:14:05.136
Come on!

1:14:06.485 --> 1:14:07.704
Come on!

1:14:07.791 --> 1:14:09.053
Don't fall apart on us now!

1:14:09.140 --> 1:14:10.663
Come on!

1:14:14.580 --> 1:14:17.627
Better make it quick, Shatto!
We're running out of fish!

1:14:19.150 --> 1:14:22.109
Pull! Pull!
We got you, hold on!

1:14:22.196 --> 1:14:23.720
We got you.

1:14:23.807 --> 1:14:26.723
[groans]

1:14:33.207 --> 1:14:35.558
Keep going!
We're almost there!

1:14:35.645 --> 1:14:38.822
It's working.
We're moving!

1:14:38.909 --> 1:14:40.171
It's working!

1:14:43.087 --> 1:14:45.742
Okay! Come on!
Get back here!

1:14:45.829 --> 1:14:47.831
-Move!
-Come on! Come on, Shatto!

1:14:56.230 --> 1:14:57.928
Move, Shatto!

1:14:58.015 --> 1:15:00.844
-Shatto, come on!
-Just move!

1:15:00.931 --> 1:15:02.759
Don't look back! Move!

1:15:12.899 --> 1:15:14.248
Shatto!

1:15:14.335 --> 1:15:16.120
No, Banning, I cannot
lose you, either.

1:15:16.207 --> 1:15:18.165
-Shatto!
-Banning, no!

1:15:18.252 --> 1:15:22.126
-No!
-Shatto!

1:15:24.955 --> 1:15:26.783
Come on, you know we
have to keep moving.

1:15:26.870 --> 1:15:28.828
-Okay, you know it.
-Shatto...

1:15:28.915 --> 1:15:30.526
Hey, hey.

1:15:30.613 --> 1:15:33.093
Banning, you know we have to get
off this boat, okay?

1:15:33.180 --> 1:15:34.486
We have to go.

1:15:34.573 --> 1:15:36.053
Okay.. okay.

1:15:43.234 --> 1:15:44.583
[grunting]

1:15:47.412 --> 1:15:48.674
Come on.
I got you, baby girl.

1:15:48.761 --> 1:15:49.719
Come on.

1:15:49.806 --> 1:15:51.895
Hold on one second!

1:15:51.982 --> 1:15:54.027
I'm coming, Lucia!
I'm coming, baby!

1:15:54.114 --> 1:15:55.551
Come on!

1:15:55.638 --> 1:15:57.640
-We're out of time here!
-Come on.

1:15:59.903 --> 1:16:01.644
I got you, I got you.

1:16:01.731 --> 1:16:03.297
Banning, come on!

1:16:06.126 --> 1:16:08.651
This is my boat!
I choose how it goes down!

1:16:10.304 --> 1:16:13.177
Captain Banning, just leave it,
just let it go!

1:16:15.005 --> 1:16:17.529
Yeah, you want this boat?

1:16:17.616 --> 1:16:18.661
Come chew on this!

1:16:26.146 --> 1:16:27.583
[Dan] Come on!

1:16:29.976 --> 1:16:31.761
Danny! Danny!

1:16:31.848 --> 1:16:34.024
Help! Uncle Dan!

1:16:34.111 --> 1:16:35.155
[screaming]

1:16:41.597 --> 1:16:42.772
Oh my God!

1:16:42.859 --> 1:16:44.600
-No! Uncle Dan!
-He's gone!

1:16:44.687 --> 1:16:47.298
Lucia, he's gone!
Honey, he's gone, baby.

1:16:47.385 --> 1:16:49.039
Come back here.
Come back here.

1:16:49.126 --> 1:16:51.215
Come back here.

1:16:52.172 --> 1:16:53.957
[shouting]

1:16:54.044 --> 1:16:57.917
Banning, get your butt in here!

1:16:58.004 --> 1:17:00.528
Banning! Come here!

1:17:00.616 --> 1:17:02.095
Wait! Give me my tackle box!

1:17:07.187 --> 1:17:08.972
Go on!

1:17:09.973 --> 1:17:11.888
Get in here!

1:17:11.975 --> 1:17:14.107
Wait, my leg.

1:17:14.194 --> 1:17:16.762
Are you okay, honey?
Are you okay?

1:17:16.849 --> 1:17:19.243
Matches. I need matches!
I need matches!

1:17:19.330 --> 1:17:20.984
I quit smoking.

1:17:24.727 --> 1:17:26.076
-Will this do?
-Atta girl!

1:17:28.339 --> 1:17:30.167
You're gonna have
to drive, hon.

1:17:38.044 --> 1:17:40.090
30 years we were together!

1:17:40.177 --> 1:17:41.831
To the Jubilation!

1:17:42.875 --> 1:17:44.224
Goodbye, girl!

1:17:44.311 --> 1:17:45.922
[grunts]

1:18:00.763 --> 1:18:01.851
Thank you, Danny.

1:18:12.862 --> 1:18:14.994
Whoa.
Come in, Officer Fuentes.

1:18:15.081 --> 1:18:16.169
There's been an explosion.

1:18:16.256 --> 1:18:17.736
Copy that.

1:18:17.823 --> 1:18:19.825
Can you get close enough
to find any survivors?

1:18:19.912 --> 1:18:23.046
It's almost impossible to see
anything through the smoke.

1:18:23.133 --> 1:18:25.048
I might have to circle
down a little bit lower.

1:18:25.135 --> 1:18:27.050
You wait as long as you need to.

1:18:27.137 --> 1:18:30.053
We can't leave until we know
for sure one way or the other.

1:18:31.054 --> 1:18:32.490
Roger.

1:18:35.972 --> 1:18:37.800
You're all right, baby.
Get ready.

1:18:43.762 --> 1:18:46.634
The smoke is too thick.
I'm gonna have to circle back.

1:18:46.722 --> 1:18:49.202
Do two more pass throughs
and then we'll call it.

1:18:49.289 --> 1:18:50.726
Copy.

1:18:51.944 --> 1:18:54.642
Come on, Banning.
Where are you?

1:18:54.730 --> 1:18:56.340
Come on.

1:18:56.427 --> 1:18:58.298
We'll find him.
Don't worry.

1:18:58.385 --> 1:18:59.909
We have to.

1:18:59.996 --> 1:19:01.867
Banning can't be gone,
not like this.

1:19:01.954 --> 1:19:05.653
Look, I never told
you, but after my divorce,

1:19:05.741 --> 1:19:07.220
I was in pretty bad shape.

1:19:07.307 --> 1:19:10.746
I'd work, come home, that's it.
Just work.

1:19:10.833 --> 1:19:14.053
I even canceled
my fishing trips.

1:19:14.140 --> 1:19:18.754
But Banning... he found out
where I live, came to my house.

1:19:18.841 --> 1:19:21.017
He refused to leave until

1:19:21.104 --> 1:19:23.062
I agreed to go fishing
with him again.

1:19:23.149 --> 1:19:25.935
I'm sorry.
I just can't give up on this.

1:19:26.022 --> 1:19:28.764
I gotta find him.

1:19:28.851 --> 1:19:30.591
Well, keep looking.

1:19:30.678 --> 1:19:33.246
We won't call it in either
way until we know for sure.

1:19:33.333 --> 1:19:35.379
Thank you.

1:19:39.035 --> 1:19:40.471
There's gotta be
something we're missing.

1:19:44.127 --> 1:19:45.215
Wait.

1:19:45.302 --> 1:19:46.956
I think I see something.

1:19:47.043 --> 1:19:48.392
It's a life raft!

1:19:48.479 --> 1:19:50.307
Are you sure?

1:19:50.394 --> 1:19:52.048
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

1:19:52.135 --> 1:19:53.919
Yeah, that's it!

1:19:54.006 --> 1:19:56.313
-Hey!
-Yes, it is!

1:19:56.400 --> 1:19:58.402
It looks like
Banning's with them.

1:19:58.489 --> 1:20:00.796
We got 'em! We got 'em!
That's them!

1:20:00.883 --> 1:20:02.972
That is great news, officer.

1:20:03.059 --> 1:20:05.452
Get TK-421 on and let them know.

1:20:05.539 --> 1:20:07.150
Copy.

1:20:07.237 --> 1:20:09.239
Tango-Kelo 421, do you copy?

1:20:09.326 --> 1:20:10.849
Go for TK-421.

1:20:10.936 --> 1:20:12.198
Hey, we found the survivors.

1:20:12.285 --> 1:20:13.591
Looks to be three of them.

1:20:13.678 --> 1:20:15.071
And Captain Banning's
one of them.

1:20:15.158 --> 1:20:16.463
Copy that.

1:20:16.550 --> 1:20:18.988
I'm mounting a rescue ASAP.

1:20:19.075 --> 1:20:21.947
Congratulations.

1:20:22.034 --> 1:20:22.992
We found the Jubilation
and Banning

1:20:23.079 --> 1:20:24.254
and the rest of the survivors.

1:20:24.341 --> 1:20:26.343
Okay.

1:20:26.430 --> 1:20:28.084
Hey, a celebration
is definitely in order

1:20:28.171 --> 1:20:30.434
when you get back
to the station.

1:20:30.521 --> 1:20:32.523
Thank you.
I'm looking forward to it.

1:20:32.610 --> 1:20:34.351
Now if you'll excuse me,

1:20:34.438 --> 1:20:36.832
I have to drop a ladder and
get them out of this mess.

1:20:36.919 --> 1:20:39.182
Copy that.
See you soon.

1:20:42.968 --> 1:20:47.103
[speaking Spanish]

1:20:47.190 --> 1:20:48.974
-Down here!
-We're saved!

1:20:49.061 --> 1:20:50.019
Down here!

1:20:50.106 --> 1:20:52.456
Hey!

1:20:52.543 --> 1:20:54.284
Yes, we are!

1:20:56.199 --> 1:20:57.853
Hey!

1:21:06.949 --> 1:21:09.038
Hey!

1:21:09.125 --> 1:21:11.127
It's okay, baby.

1:21:11.214 --> 1:21:13.042
We're going home.

1:21:17.394 --> 1:21:20.223
Quick, quick, come on!

1:21:20.310 --> 1:21:22.486
Okay, okay.

1:21:22.573 --> 1:21:24.401
We're good, we're good.

1:21:32.148 --> 1:21:35.847
Lucia:
But what about the Jubilation?

1:21:35.934 --> 1:21:41.374
Banning:
Oh, no big deal.

1:21:41.461 --> 1:21:43.333
Lucia:
No big deal?

1:21:43.420 --> 1:21:47.424
Didn't you have her
for all this time?

1:21:47.511 --> 1:21:50.122
That's just what
I tell my charters.

1:21:50.209 --> 1:21:54.257
Truth is, I just bought
it off eBay last year.

1:21:59.001 --> 1:22:03.266
All these people... gone.

1:22:03.353 --> 1:22:07.096
Wyatt...and Shatto.

1:22:07.183 --> 1:22:09.359
They're all just...gone.

1:22:12.275 --> 1:22:13.624
But not forgotten.

1:22:14.581 --> 1:22:16.322
Si.
