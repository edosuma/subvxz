WEBVTT

00:14.681 --> 00:15.932
Skadoosh.

00:23.898 --> 00:25.692
-I can't believe it.

00:25.775 --> 00:27.861
I just-- How could she?

00:27.944 --> 00:30.947
It doesn't make sense.
I thought we were friends.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.575
I can't believe it. I can't believe it!

00:34.159 --> 00:37.370
Man, you think you know someone
and you really don't.

00:37.954 --> 00:39.497
Just leave you in the dust.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.918
I can't believe she left me.
We've been working together, like…

00:44.794 --> 00:45.670
three full days,

00:45.754 --> 00:48.089
and we hit one little snag
and she just ditches me?

00:48.173 --> 00:51.509
I'm a fantastic partner.
A top-notch travel buddy.

00:51.593 --> 00:56.055
But she never gave me a chance.
It was always, "No, Po," this

00:56.139 --> 00:58.600
and, "No, Po," that.

00:58.683 --> 01:00.310
I need, "Yes, Po."

01:00.393 --> 01:02.520
Tell me about it.

01:02.604 --> 01:05.106
That's the trouble
with one-sided friendships.

01:05.190 --> 01:08.109
Don't realize you're in one
until you're on the outside.

01:08.193 --> 01:09.778
So true.

01:09.861 --> 01:13.281
No talking, Weimin.
The Emperor awaits his prisoner.

01:13.823 --> 01:15.992
Push!

01:16.076 --> 01:18.161
Hey, are we stopping
for lunch anytime soon?

01:18.244 --> 01:20.497
I'd die for some noodle soup
right about now.

01:21.164 --> 01:22.749
-Enough!

01:22.832 --> 01:25.251
-If you want to--

01:27.420 --> 01:28.254
What?

01:28.797 --> 01:30.048
Check around the--

01:39.682 --> 01:41.559
Stay on your toes, Weimin.

01:42.727 --> 01:45.188
Prove you're not completely useless.

01:52.153 --> 01:53.905
Blade! I knew you'd--

01:53.988 --> 01:55.156
-Hm?

01:55.240 --> 01:56.991
-What?

02:29.482 --> 02:31.568
You must stop Klaus and Veruca.

02:32.318 --> 02:33.319
You know that.

02:34.404 --> 02:35.405
Po knew that.

02:38.116 --> 02:39.993
You made the right choice.

02:57.176 --> 02:58.928
You're the girl from the village.

03:00.305 --> 03:01.681
What are you doing here alone?

03:02.265 --> 03:03.433
You saved my life.

03:03.516 --> 03:04.684
-Whoa…

03:04.767 --> 03:06.769
And that means my life is yours.

03:06.853 --> 03:10.815
Until I can save your life,
I owe you a life debt.

03:11.941 --> 03:15.445
I applaud your chivalry,
little one, but run on home.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.030
You don't owe me anything.

03:18.031 --> 03:18.865
I mean it.

03:19.616 --> 03:20.450
Go home!

03:21.910 --> 03:22.744
Okay.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.166
Go on.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.044
It's that way.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.258
Fine. Come on.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.819
What's it say on that map?

03:59.239 --> 04:00.615
It's not a map.

04:00.698 --> 04:05.745
And it only says the Whip of Endless Flame
ought to be in some sort of city out here.

04:05.828 --> 04:09.374
All I see is sand and shrubs,
sand and shrubs!

04:09.457 --> 04:12.335
I've already seen this shrub.

04:12.418 --> 04:14.879
We've been going in circles for days!

04:14.963 --> 04:17.840
Stop looking at shrubs
and look for a city.

04:17.924 --> 04:20.677
I hate this place and I hate you.

04:20.760 --> 04:24.722
Oh. Funny way to say,
"Thank you for breaking me out of jail."

04:24.806 --> 04:27.892
-Thank you? Thank you?!

04:27.976 --> 04:32.021
Fifteen years
I stayed in that bloody cell.

04:37.568 --> 04:40.071
Though some days I wish I was back!

04:41.698 --> 04:44.242
The Emperor
will have you hunted

04:44.325 --> 04:46.369
for interfering in his plans.

04:51.749 --> 04:54.043
Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.379
Yikes.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.216
Uh, thanks for the assist.

05:00.842 --> 05:01.968
I think.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.179
Inching towards me like a spooky wizard.

05:05.263 --> 05:07.348
Any chance
you're here to break me out?

05:08.224 --> 05:10.226
That's a no!

05:10.310 --> 05:11.811
No!

05:11.894 --> 05:13.730
I planned this!

05:20.862 --> 05:22.238
No, not now, cliff!

05:37.211 --> 05:40.590
Who needs a dumb old knight
when you're a Dragon Ma--

05:52.560 --> 05:53.770
Okay.

05:56.272 --> 05:58.357
-Hello?

05:58.441 --> 06:01.069
Mysterious cloak person with a trappy gun?

06:02.278 --> 06:04.322
I'm alone.

06:04.947 --> 06:07.867
Which is good.
Nobody to tell me what to do.

06:08.534 --> 06:12.497
"Just go home, Po.
You're not to get in my way anymore."

06:12.580 --> 06:16.417
Get in your way? I'm gonna find
the WuGao Gauntlet without you, huh?

06:16.501 --> 06:18.711
Clear my name
and become the Dragon Master again.

06:18.795 --> 06:22.048
And then you'll go to jail
for being a, a total, total jerk.

06:22.131 --> 06:24.175
"Is that your best comeback?"

06:24.258 --> 06:25.635
I'm working on it!

06:25.718 --> 06:29.180
Also, I'm working on your accent.
"I think it's pretty good."

06:29.263 --> 06:31.641
Well,
at least we agree on something.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.274
Where's your friend?

06:40.358 --> 06:43.986
H-He wasn't my friend.

06:44.070 --> 06:46.280
And I, I had to leave him behind.

06:49.450 --> 06:51.577
-Why?
-I'm on a mission.

06:52.078 --> 06:54.413
-Why?
-I'm trying to right some wrongs--

06:54.497 --> 06:55.998
-Why--
-Do not say "why."

06:58.876 --> 07:02.463
-Look, what I'm doing is dangerous.

07:02.547 --> 07:04.966
Just enjoy being a kid while you can.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.885
Someone told me that once.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.097
I've been on my own since I was your age,

07:11.180 --> 07:13.641
and I've never relied on
anyone but myself.

07:13.724 --> 07:15.101
What about your not-friend?

07:15.685 --> 07:17.395
I never relied on Po.

07:17.478 --> 07:19.564
I was stuck with him.
All I got from him was--

07:19.647 --> 07:20.982
That map?

07:26.154 --> 07:27.405
Hey, look. We're here.

07:27.488 --> 07:28.865
The spice market.

07:29.949 --> 07:31.534
The Gateway to the Desert.

07:33.619 --> 07:35.788
It's super dangerous.

07:35.872 --> 07:38.207
I can definitely save your life there.

07:38.291 --> 07:41.002
You may walk me to the market.

07:41.085 --> 07:43.087
Then promise me you'll go home.

07:43.754 --> 07:47.508
On my sword, I give you my word.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.304
Then rise, little one.

07:51.387 --> 07:52.513
Rabi.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.017
And lead the way.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.621
super lost.

08:18.456 --> 08:21.209
The map said the desert was south.
But which way is south?

08:21.292 --> 08:23.211
"You're terrible at directions."

08:23.294 --> 08:24.253
Who asked you?

08:24.337 --> 08:26.839
-Yeah!

08:27.423 --> 08:28.925
-Weimin?

08:31.344 --> 08:33.471
Please. Please don't hurt me.

08:33.554 --> 08:35.431
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

08:36.432 --> 08:39.310
Alright, where's the rest
of the Forbidden Company?

08:39.393 --> 08:41.312
I, I don't know.

08:41.395 --> 08:44.148
My rope was loose, so I just ran for it.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.692
I am so gonna get fired.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.903
I'll be forbidden
from the Forbidden Company.

08:48.986 --> 08:51.989
You might as well just kill me,
'cause my life's over.

08:58.287 --> 08:59.705
Do you know which way is south?

09:01.958 --> 09:02.792
Thanks.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.424
Sorry you couldn't defeat me.

09:12.301 --> 09:15.012
-Good luck with the job though.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.724
Uh, hey.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.101
You-- Ow!

09:20.184 --> 09:23.062
I heard you say you were
on a mission to clear your name, right?

09:23.145 --> 09:24.855
What if I helped?

09:25.356 --> 09:28.484
-You just tried to arrest me. Twice!

09:30.027 --> 09:34.824
Look. You wanna be the Dragon Master again
and all I wanna be is taken seriously.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.118
Please, just…

09:37.618 --> 09:38.953
Give me a chance.

09:40.997 --> 09:43.833
Everyone deserves a chance.

09:50.881 --> 09:52.300
Come on.

09:53.175 --> 09:55.678
If I remember correctly,
we are looking for…

09:55.761 --> 09:56.596
the desert.

09:56.679 --> 09:58.598
You have an excellent memory.

09:58.681 --> 10:00.057
You're very astute, Weimin.

10:00.141 --> 10:03.519
Wandering Blade never complimented me.
The closest thing she ever said was,

10:03.603 --> 10:07.148
"Stop it or I'll slice off
your fingers and toss them into a well."

10:07.231 --> 10:08.941
She sounds terrible.

10:09.025 --> 10:12.570
Nah, she wasn't terrible. Just tough.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.157
Which way, boss?

10:19.493 --> 10:21.245
Hm. It's up to me, huh?

10:21.329 --> 10:23.122
Okay. Right.

10:23.205 --> 10:24.749
-No, left.
-That's my--

10:24.832 --> 10:25.666
No, right!

10:25.750 --> 10:27.627
That's my favorite direction.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.812
Hey, watch where you're going.

10:52.068 --> 10:53.778
Okay, we're here!

10:54.362 --> 10:55.696
Thank you, Rabia.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.156
Now go home.

10:57.823 --> 10:58.658
Okay.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.052
Do you see what I see?

11:18.594 --> 11:20.638
-A city!

11:20.721 --> 11:22.515
A city in the desert!

11:30.773 --> 11:33.275
Such a steep hill.

11:33.943 --> 11:40.157
So then, she told me I can't touch
the Black Steel of the Equinox!

11:40.241 --> 11:42.410
-Even when I said it like that.

11:43.244 --> 11:45.162
Such a cool name.

11:45.246 --> 11:46.705
So cool!

11:46.789 --> 11:48.082
I don't know, Weimin.

11:48.165 --> 11:51.210
Maybe she's right.
Maybe I am immature and irresponsible.

11:51.293 --> 11:53.087
Hey! Don't do that.

11:53.170 --> 11:56.048
Don't be mean to my friend, Po.

11:58.717 --> 12:00.511
-Look!

12:01.512 --> 12:03.889
Down there!
Right where you said it was.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.810
Whew! I don't wanna walk down.

12:10.729 --> 12:11.647
Woohoo!

12:12.398 --> 12:14.608
-Let's go!

12:22.908 --> 12:25.536
-Whoa!

12:29.457 --> 12:31.250
Aw…

12:41.594 --> 12:45.014
Ah, this place smells like
everything all at once!

13:02.823 --> 13:06.160
-You deserve it, boss.
-You don't miss a thing, do you, Weimin?

13:06.243 --> 13:07.077
-Boop!

13:07.161 --> 13:09.246
Matter of fact,
I don't miss a thing either.

13:24.220 --> 13:25.888
Perhaps we could stock up?

13:26.388 --> 13:28.015
So which ploy should we do?

13:28.098 --> 13:31.519
I wanna do
Chop, Chop, Little Brother!

13:31.602 --> 13:34.605
What? I don't like doing
Chop, Chop, Little Brother!

13:34.688 --> 13:36.732
-Chop, chop!

13:38.817 --> 13:41.278
-Oh no! My brother's choking!

13:41.362 --> 13:43.155
-Help! Help!

13:45.783 --> 13:48.327
Sir, are you okay?
Somebody help him!

13:48.410 --> 13:50.621
-Come on, guys!
-Hurry!

13:50.704 --> 13:52.706
Don't mind if I do, I do.

14:04.843 --> 14:08.097
The Emperor thinks I'm evil, but…

14:08.180 --> 14:10.808
I only fought those guards
'cause I had to.

14:10.891 --> 14:12.351
-You believe me, right?
-Mm.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.562
Yeah, man, sure.

14:14.645 --> 14:17.022
Oh, here. Try these spicy ones.

14:20.526 --> 14:23.445
Oh!
Oh, that's good spice!

14:23.529 --> 14:27.074
-Someone help! He's choking!

14:27.867 --> 14:28.784
But wh--

14:30.619 --> 14:33.080
-Money or your lives, optimists!

14:33.163 --> 14:36.166
Never doing
Chop, Chop, Little Brother again.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.335
Weimin, let's ride!

14:44.216 --> 14:45.301
Sorry, bud.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.428
Can't let you run off on me again.

14:49.096 --> 14:50.681
Weimin, wh-what are you doing?

14:51.265 --> 14:53.809
I'm turning you in
to the Emperor all by myself.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.020
You're turning me into the Emperor?

14:56.103 --> 14:57.855
Wow. Me, the Emperor.

14:57.938 --> 15:00.441
No, I'm not turning you into the Emperor.

15:00.524 --> 15:02.443
I'm turning you in to the Emperor.

15:02.526 --> 15:04.528
It sounds like
you're saying the same thing.

15:04.612 --> 15:05.863
You're under arrest!

15:05.946 --> 15:07.448
I'm under a noodle cart.

15:07.531 --> 15:08.532
You're going to jail!

15:10.743 --> 15:12.912
But I thought we were partners.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.121
Friends.

15:14.204 --> 15:16.123
I gave you a chance.

15:16.206 --> 15:18.834
I was just telling you
what you wanted to hear,

15:18.918 --> 15:21.337
soften you up
until ol' Weimin could strike.

15:24.673 --> 15:26.717
This is kinda on you.

15:28.552 --> 15:30.804
And you made it super easy.

15:32.890 --> 15:34.642
Boop-de-boop-de-doo.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.898
You used noodles against me.

15:42.816 --> 15:43.901
No one…

15:44.401 --> 15:46.528
-…uses…

15:46.612 --> 15:47.821
-…noodles…
-Huh?

15:48.530 --> 15:50.532
-…against me!

15:54.495 --> 15:56.497
Doop.

16:01.835 --> 16:03.128
Klaus and Veruca?

16:03.212 --> 16:04.797
You're not getting away this time.

16:06.131 --> 16:08.342
Stop right there, Clark and Vanessa!

16:20.062 --> 16:20.896
Po!

16:21.855 --> 16:22.815
Blade.

16:22.898 --> 16:23.857
You escaped?

16:23.941 --> 16:25.025
No thanks to you!

16:25.109 --> 16:26.610
I got a mission too, you know.

16:26.694 --> 16:29.071
To stop two evil weasels
and clear my name?

16:29.154 --> 16:30.739
Those weasels are mine.

16:39.498 --> 16:42.084
Ha! I've got you this time.

16:42.167 --> 16:44.586
Look, Veruca.
It's that bear from the river.

16:44.670 --> 16:47.965
Oh! I guess pandas really do swim, eh?

16:48.048 --> 16:49.550
Pandy Wandy?

16:49.633 --> 16:51.343
Stop right there, Klaus and Veruca!

16:55.347 --> 16:57.433
Hm. Looks like your boyfriend's taken.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.268
That blasted bear again!

16:59.351 --> 17:00.602
What's her problem?

17:00.686 --> 17:01.729
That's your problem.

17:01.812 --> 17:05.149
You think you're so perfect with
your noble mission and deep dark secrets.

17:05.232 --> 17:07.860
-You think you're better than everyone.
-Not everyone, j--

17:07.943 --> 17:09.528
Dragon Master!

17:09.611 --> 17:12.489
What? You let
those Komodo dragons follow you?

17:12.573 --> 17:13.490
No, just Weimin.

17:13.574 --> 17:15.784
Hey, I'm a lot more than "just Weimin"!

17:23.584 --> 17:24.626
Enough of this!

17:40.642 --> 17:42.728
You missed me.

17:42.811 --> 17:44.188
Do you remember me?

17:45.355 --> 17:49.026
What? You been chasing us.

17:49.610 --> 17:50.652
Not that.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.154
-Before.

17:53.489 --> 17:55.949
Do you remember me?

17:56.575 --> 17:58.619
-Huh?

18:04.416 --> 18:07.419
You're that little girl.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.756
-Not so little anymore.

18:18.013 --> 18:19.723
-Huh?

18:23.227 --> 18:25.979
-Not so anything anymore!

18:26.063 --> 18:27.397
-No!

18:27.481 --> 18:30.067
'Ello 'ello again.

18:30.692 --> 18:32.027
Hands off, panda.

18:34.696 --> 18:36.323
-Come on, then.

18:39.785 --> 18:42.162
Oh no, not this guy again.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.706
-90% sure he's not on our side.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.042
Ninety-nine.

18:50.170 --> 18:51.672
You know this person?

18:51.755 --> 18:54.800
I didn't exactly escape
the Forbidden Company, okay?

18:54.883 --> 18:57.219
Creepy McRopelauncher took them out.

19:01.557 --> 19:02.474
Come on.

19:03.183 --> 19:04.977
A little more. I just gotta…

19:06.019 --> 19:07.771
I think I got…

19:09.690 --> 19:10.774
Come on.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.075
Thanks.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.118
Come on!

19:27.374 --> 19:30.419
-I knew it!

19:31.086 --> 19:32.004
You do care.

19:32.087 --> 19:35.048
And I'm sorry.
I don't need a yes-man like Weimin.

19:35.132 --> 19:36.967
My life's been too easy already.

19:37.050 --> 19:39.094
I need someone like you to push me.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.054
-We're partners--

19:41.138 --> 19:42.723
That's not good.

19:44.641 --> 19:46.727
I'm so glad we can work together again.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.483
Po! There's
a deadly sandstorm in front of us

19:53.567 --> 19:55.903
and a person behind us
who wants to kill us.

19:56.486 --> 19:59.156
Should we really be
talking about this right now?

19:59.781 --> 20:01.116
So there's a "we" again?

20:01.867 --> 20:03.660
If you think "we" can take them.

20:03.744 --> 20:05.204
-Yeah!

20:15.589 --> 20:17.132
Boom!

20:17.216 --> 20:20.177
Two lives saved. Life debt repaid.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.055
-Rabia?

20:23.138 --> 20:25.682
You dropped us
into an underground tunnel?

20:27.559 --> 20:30.229
Wait, this is
that little girl from the village?

20:30.312 --> 20:32.814
Did you kidnap her?

20:32.898 --> 20:34.358
Come on! This way.

20:34.441 --> 20:35.275
This is…

20:35.859 --> 20:38.237
-This is Rabia's home.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.154
Hm.

20:39.863 --> 20:41.949
Come on. I'll show you the way out.

20:42.741 --> 20:45.827
No one answered my kidnapping question.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.087
Thank you, Rabi.

20:55.587 --> 20:58.340
Perhaps I can't do everything on my own.

20:58.423 --> 20:59.633
You dropped this.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.475
Po.

21:08.976 --> 21:10.811
-I-It's possible that I--
-Yes?

21:10.894 --> 21:11.770
-Hush!

21:13.355 --> 21:14.189
Po.

21:15.065 --> 21:17.609
-From now on, you can carry the map.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.405
Oh my gosh, I knew it!

21:21.488 --> 21:23.991
Talk over. We're walking now. Okay?

21:27.494 --> 21:31.081
I don't know who you are, but thank you,
wizened child of the desert.

21:31.164 --> 21:33.583
Um, okay. Bye-bye!

21:36.795 --> 21:38.588
So how far until the Lost City?

21:38.672 --> 21:40.590
520,000 steps.

21:40.674 --> 21:42.592
And how many are we on?

21:42.676 --> 21:45.053
Are you counting?
I mean, did you start counting yet?

21:45.137 --> 21:47.055
Yes, and now I've lost my place.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.766
Oh, sorry! Okay, well,
now we can count together.

21:49.850 --> 21:51.935
-Out loud!
-Po?

21:52.019 --> 21:53.562
-Mm-hm?
-Give me the map back.

21:53.645 --> 21:57.649
-Oh, I knew he was the Dragon Master!

21:58.233 --> 22:00.319
He ruined my noodle cart.

22:00.402 --> 22:01.903
I'm telling the Emperor!

22:11.747 --> 22:15.167
Rabia, sweetie, where on Earth did you go?

22:15.250 --> 22:17.252
-Hello.

22:35.896 --> 22:39.441
I'm wondering
if you could help me find an old friend.
