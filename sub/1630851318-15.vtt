10:51.985 --> 10:53.787
I don't have the guide roller,
Shaun.

10:53.921 --> 10:55.055
That's why
I'm improvising.

10:55.388 --> 10:57.257
Oh.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.793
You improvised building
our furniture.

10:59.927 --> 11:02.462
Now our Kongsvinger cabinet
is missing a panel.

11:02.595 --> 11:04.497
Which I repurposed into
an extra drawer for your desk.

11:05.298 --> 11:07.100
Oh, good point.
Ah.

11:07.234 --> 11:08.802
Shouldn't you be
with your aunt?

11:08.936 --> 11:12.439
Seeing her on a ventilator...
being here is better.

11:12.572 --> 11:13.640
Mmm.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.475
Did you bring in
your girlfriend?

11:16.243 --> 11:19.713
Oh, Lea is my fiancee.

11:22.015 --> 11:22.983
But you are a mechanic?

11:23.116 --> 11:25.285
No.
I--

11:25.418 --> 11:27.120
I thought you said
you were bringing in--

11:27.254 --> 11:30.057
I'm a software engineer,
and I used to work

11:30.190 --> 11:32.125
for a car company
and run my brother's garage.

11:32.826 --> 11:33.827
It failed.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.029
I know what I'm doing.

11:36.163 --> 11:38.031
The control box
short-circuited

11:38.165 --> 11:39.833
because the fan belt
is faulty.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.634

11:46.539 --> 11:47.540
Kevin.

11:49.642 --> 11:51.578
Carlton.

11:51.711 --> 11:55.983
You need
reconstructive surgery
on your face and your ribs.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.551
Three of them are broken
and displaced.

11:58.685 --> 12:01.054
One of them was broken before
and healed improperly,

12:01.989 --> 12:03.156
because you
never told anyone.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.028
Who's doing this to you?

12:08.996 --> 12:09.997
No one.

12:11.631 --> 12:14.434
Kevin, will you please
put down the book
and talk to me?

12:15.368 --> 12:19.406
****

12:19.539 --> 12:21.641
One of your ribs
could've punctured your lung
and killed you.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.678
If someone in the home
is abusing you--

12:25.813 --> 12:28.381
Stop.
Stop interrogating me.

12:28.515 --> 12:29.549
I'm trying
to protect you.

12:31.218 --> 12:33.153
But I need to know
who I'm protecting you from.

12:33.620 --> 12:36.356

12:39.426 --> 12:41.194
Just fix
my broken bones, okay?

12:42.129 --> 12:45.032

12:49.202 --> 12:51.271
Joan's body
is fighting the vent.

12:51.404 --> 12:53.206
We may need to
chemically paralyze her.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.408
That doesn't sound good.

12:55.542 --> 12:58.045
It's not. It could
impair her ability

12:58.178 --> 12:59.579
to transition back
to the iron lung.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.052
Shaun,
you're scaring her,

13:05.185 --> 13:07.554
and I think unnecessarily,
because...

13:07.687 --> 13:09.289
(WHIRRING)

13:12.826 --> 13:14.194
I was right.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.429
Calling you was
a good idea.

13:16.563 --> 13:18.131
Calling me
is always a good idea.

13:22.735 --> 13:26.439
(RATTLING,
WHIRRING QUICKENS)

13:26.573 --> 13:29.242

The gearbox is blown.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.154
You-- You know how
to fix it, right?

13:43.123 --> 13:44.824
Yes.

13:44.958 --> 13:48.261
But I need parts
that haven't been
manufactured since the '50s.

14:00.407 --> 14:02.409
SOPHIE:
This is Sophie again.

14:02.542 --> 14:06.679
I left the message earlier
about your Reddit post
on the '38 Chevy.

14:06.813 --> 14:09.416
We really, really need
that gearbox,

14:09.549 --> 14:11.284
so we're just driving
out to you.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.155
I'm sure he's just
with customers.

14:18.791 --> 14:21.394
You and Shaun hugged
at the hospital.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.163
So he's comfortable
with physical contact?

14:23.296 --> 14:24.631
Sometimes.

14:24.764 --> 14:25.598
With me,
most of the time.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.668
How's the sex?

14:28.801 --> 14:31.304
Did you really just ask me
if my fiance,

14:31.438 --> 14:33.306
your aunt's surgeon,
is good in bed?

14:33.440 --> 14:35.508
Eh, welcome to life
with a documentarian.

14:35.642 --> 14:37.410
Curiosity and lack
of boundaries

14:37.544 --> 14:38.378
are sort of
in the job description.

14:39.746 --> 14:40.948
You can feel free
not to answer.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.986
Shaun is very focused
and determined...

14:48.421 --> 14:50.924
...in all areas.
(CHUCKLES)

14:51.058 --> 14:53.360
Good for him.
And for you.

14:55.328 --> 14:57.931
And what about
just day to day?

14:58.065 --> 15:00.567
There must be times when he
struggles 'cause of his ASD,

15:00.700 --> 15:03.670
you know, loud noises,
bright lights, itchy sheets?

15:03.803 --> 15:04.704
For sure.

15:05.973 --> 15:07.874
This morning I hit snooze
too many times,

15:08.008 --> 15:09.542
and he turned off my alarm.
(CHUCKLES)

15:09.676 --> 15:11.178
That really screwed up
his routine.

15:11.311 --> 15:12.345
That's a big deal to him.

15:13.981 --> 15:16.049
So what do you do now?

15:16.183 --> 15:17.850
I'll probably sleep
in the guest room

15:17.985 --> 15:19.186
when I have
to wake up early.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.091
One time, I went to Maui
with this guy I was dating,

15:24.224 --> 15:26.726
Travis, and we were gonna do
the Road to Hana.

15:26.859 --> 15:29.296
But the car rental place
didn't have pedal extensions.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.764
And I was just like, "Fine.
Travis will drive."

15:31.898 --> 15:33.366
He went off.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.702
He was threatening
to report them,
quoting the ADA,

15:35.835 --> 15:37.370
demanding to speak
to a manager.

15:37.770 --> 15:38.972
Mmm.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.907
He was being my advocate,

15:41.041 --> 15:44.077
but for me,
it was just another reminder
that I'm different.

15:44.211 --> 15:46.146
The world does that to me.
I don't--

15:46.279 --> 15:47.580
I don't need it
from my boyfriend.

15:49.549 --> 15:52.986
Don't think Shaun
feels that way about
me accommodating him.

15:53.120 --> 15:57.390
It's just when one person
does all the accommodating,
it's not good.

15:58.258 --> 16:00.827
****

16:04.897 --> 16:07.400
This will make sure
your heart is healthy enough
for surgery.

16:17.244 --> 16:18.245
Jean-Michel Basquiat?

16:19.746 --> 16:20.647
Mmm.

16:21.714 --> 16:23.216
You know,
he did one painting

16:23.350 --> 16:25.485
with Charlie Parker
and Dizzy Gillespie that--

16:25.618 --> 16:27.620
"Ornithology."

16:27.754 --> 16:30.323
That's a part of his
"Heroes and Saints" series.

16:31.424 --> 16:32.425
You learn about him
in art class?

16:32.825 --> 16:34.261
I wish.

16:34.394 --> 16:37.430
No, I just spend a lot of time
on Google Images
and Wikipedia.

16:41.434 --> 16:42.435
Your heart's fine.

16:44.937 --> 16:45.805
You mind
if I take a look?

16:50.110 --> 16:51.111
Okay.

16:58.751 --> 16:59.952
Hmm!

17:08.095 --> 17:08.861
That's amazing.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.499
Yeah, each one's in the style

those old Dutch painters--

17:22.175 --> 17:23.843
Vermeer and Rembrandt,

17:23.976 --> 17:25.845
but he paints stuff
I actually care about.

17:26.613 --> 17:27.680
Kerry James Marshall.

17:27.814 --> 17:28.981
Yeah.

17:31.784 --> 17:32.752
Picasso.

17:32.885 --> 17:33.953
Okay,
but that one's easy.

So?

17:43.963 --> 17:45.998
So I know you are, too.
It's in your medical records.

17:46.133 --> 17:47.267
I'm not dumb.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.401
I didn't say you were.

17:51.271 --> 17:52.905
You know, some of history's
greatest geniuses

17:53.039 --> 17:56.476
were dyslexic.

a doctor?

18:08.821 --> 18:11.491
A lot of support from
my parents, my teachers--

18:11.624 --> 18:13.059
My parents are dead,

18:13.193 --> 18:15.395
and my teachers only notice me
when I'm screwing up.

18:16.763 --> 18:17.797
I noticed you.

18:20.533 --> 18:22.335
And I want to help.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.071
If that group home
is unsafe--

18:25.205 --> 18:25.938
Just gimme
my book back.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.107

18:44.957 --> 18:47.494
I don't buy it.
An iron lung?

18:47.627 --> 18:49.329
I did a whole documentary
about her.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.298
I don't care about
your documentary.

18:51.431 --> 18:54.734
I care about the 1975
Gran Torino you pulled up in.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.469
How do I know the gearbox
isn't gonna wind up

18:56.603 --> 18:59.105
in a '38 Chevy
at the Santa Cruz
Vintage Car Derby?

18:59.239 --> 19:01.908
You think we invented a story
about her aunt dying

19:02.041 --> 19:04.344
to beat you
in a vintage car competition?

19:04.477 --> 19:05.478
That's what I'd do.

19:06.613 --> 19:07.714
We can double--

19:07.847 --> 19:10.217
Quadruple
whatever you paid.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.219
(CHUCKLES) That's nothing
compared to the business

19:12.352 --> 19:13.620
I'm gonna get
after I win first prize.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.589
Mm.

19:16.723 --> 19:21.328
You got that call earlier
from Garry Gerhardt, right?

19:21.461 --> 19:23.496
Sophie's a producer
for PBS.

19:24.063 --> 19:25.164
See?

19:29.035 --> 19:30.102
You know "Gearhead"?

19:30.237 --> 19:32.505
We're talking about
collaborating on a series.

19:32.639 --> 19:33.940
I bet
"The Great American Car Show"

19:34.073 --> 19:35.442
would be interested
in your collection.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.610
And a story about
you giving away a gearbox

19:37.744 --> 19:38.978
to save a woman's life?

19:39.111 --> 19:40.580
That would bring in
more revenue

19:40.713 --> 19:43.283
than some local car show,
right?

with a gearbox
from a '38 Chevy.

20:12.779 --> 20:17.650
Hm. A little young
to know about
something that old.

20:17.784 --> 20:19.419
I've got a thing
for the classics.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.721
Well, thank God,
and thank you.

20:22.722 --> 20:26.293
And Lea is engaged
to Dr. Murphy,

20:26.426 --> 20:28.828
whose surgical talents
are matched by his skills
in the bedroom.

20:31.764 --> 20:35.268
It is important to me that Lea
is sexually satisfied.

20:35.402 --> 20:37.370
And she is also
very skilled.

20:38.871 --> 20:40.172
How great are these two?

20:41.107 --> 20:42.975
You want them
for your show.

I want them for

You two have to be in it.

You should have seen
what I tweeted about Katie

21:46.739 --> 21:50.743
I have. You think I didn't
check out your social media

in the iron lung.

22:26.413 --> 22:27.547
Her airway
will rupture again.

22:28.448 --> 22:29.782
(SIGHS)

22:32.051 --> 22:33.520
What if we gave her
diaphragm pacing

22:33.653 --> 22:35.287
with phrenic nerve
stimulation?

22:35.422 --> 22:37.790
There's no way to sync
the nerve stimulator
to the iron lung.

22:39.926 --> 22:41.794
We could take her out
of the iron lung.

22:42.429 --> 22:43.896
She would die.

22:44.030 --> 22:48.601
Yes, unless we switch her to
a biphasic cuirass ventilator.

22:48.735 --> 22:50.269
Her spine's not strong enough
for a cuirass.

22:50.937 --> 22:53.372
****

22:58.377 --> 23:01.481
****

23:06.519 --> 23:07.487
Kyphoplasties.

23:09.856 --> 23:12.425
We can pour cement
into her cracked vertebrae
to stabilize them.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.228
Good idea.

23:17.296 --> 23:18.898
****

23:23.603 --> 23:25.872
I had fun working
with you today.

23:26.005 --> 23:28.775
I get why you love
being a doctor.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.844
Being a doctor doesn't usually
involve buying old car parts.

23:33.980 --> 23:35.548
I have to wake up early
tomorrow.

23:38.485 --> 23:41.053
And I'm not going
to be sleeping
in the guest room,

23:41.187 --> 23:42.855
and you're not going to be
turning off my alarm.

23:55.334 --> 23:56.569
Shaun?

23:56.703 --> 23:58.771
I got you
a wrist alarm.

23:58.905 --> 24:01.641
It uses silent vibration
to wake you up

24:01.774 --> 24:03.910
and has
a snooze button.

24:04.043 --> 24:06.412
Like the diaphragm pacing
Jordan suggested for Joan,

24:06.546 --> 24:07.780
but for your wrist.

24:09.381 --> 24:10.883
I don't want you to sleep
in the guest room.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.053
This is
a good compromise.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.790
Are we reality show
people?

24:21.360 --> 24:24.296
Jordan says we're not because
we don't love attention.

24:25.665 --> 24:26.866
Sounds about right.

24:27.466 --> 24:28.901
****

24:29.902 --> 24:31.070
And do you disagree?

24:33.105 --> 24:36.042
Neurotypicals consider me
strange,

24:36.175 --> 24:38.077
so I am used to people
staring at me,

24:38.210 --> 24:40.780
especially after Salen put me
on that billboard.

24:40.913 --> 24:41.914
Would the attention
bother you?

24:42.815 --> 24:43.816
Maybe.

24:45.284 --> 24:48.287
The first time we tried
to plan a wedding, it sucked.

24:48.420 --> 24:51.724
And I don't want
the whole world
to watch us flailing.

24:51.858 --> 24:54.961
Maybe if Sophie does the
planning, we would not flail.

24:55.094 --> 24:58.130
And if she does the paying,
that would be very helpful.

24:58.264 --> 25:00.800
I don't think money should be
the deciding factor

25:00.933 --> 25:02.334
on the start of our life
together.

25:04.737 --> 25:05.672
Okay.

25:05.805 --> 25:08.975
****

25:14.280 --> 25:15.314
(GRUNTS)

25:15.447 --> 25:16.849
Yeah.

25:18.818 --> 25:19.952
Incision looks great.

25:23.455 --> 25:24.957
No periorbital edema.

25:25.992 --> 25:26.959
We'll monitor you tonight.

25:28.094 --> 25:29.495
So I go back tomorrow.

25:29.629 --> 25:30.630
If all's well, yes.

25:32.198 --> 25:33.299
Great.

25:33.432 --> 25:35.968
****

25:38.938 --> 25:42.208
I'll talk to Sara about
getting you a reading tutor.

25:42.341 --> 25:43.810
There are some techniques that
have really worked for me.

25:45.845 --> 25:46.979
Um...

25:49.315 --> 25:52.551
And I'm happy to talk you
through them or...

25:54.486 --> 25:55.487
Anything else.

25:55.622 --> 25:57.990

26:00.026 --> 26:01.761

26:04.296 --> 26:05.231

26:06.866 --> 26:09.001
Yeah, thanks.

26:18.911 --> 26:21.013

26:26.886 --> 26:28.387
How are you gonna hold
market share

26:28.520 --> 26:30.422
when copycats flood
the system?

26:30.556 --> 26:32.358
If we get the patent first,
that won't be an issue.

26:32.491 --> 26:35.361
There's n-nothing
in the business plan
about patent strategy.

26:35.494 --> 26:37.396
It's a work in progress.

26:37.529 --> 26:40.232
VC's are gonna be asking you
these questions,
so you gotta be ready.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.201
I'm well aware.

26:42.334 --> 26:44.236
I paid off half my med school
debt by selling--

26:44.370 --> 26:46.572
The ankle brace, yes,
I-I know about that.

26:46.706 --> 26:48.741
That's fantastic.
But this time,
you need investors, right?

26:48.875 --> 26:50.076
Not just buyers.

26:50.209 --> 26:52.044
And in this case,
you're the product.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.313
We'll be prepared.

26:54.446 --> 26:55.682
And the product--

26:55.815 --> 26:58.084
The actual product
needs to be retooled.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.758
What did you have
in mind?

27:05.892 --> 27:07.126
Okay.
Increased functionality.

27:07.259 --> 27:09.962
Imagine if it monitored
pancreatic function,

27:10.096 --> 27:12.064
hormonal levels,
and also lesions.

27:13.532 --> 27:16.535
That would require way more
power, multiple sensors.

27:17.937 --> 27:19.071
Okay.

27:21.273 --> 27:24.176
We would have to go back
to the drawing board.

27:24.310 --> 27:27.446
(SCOFFS) The drawing board
is-- is, what, two months old?

27:27.579 --> 27:31.050
Look, y-you ladies have a
multi-million dollar idea here

27:31.183 --> 27:33.452
and it's great,
but I'm suggesting to you that

27:33.585 --> 27:36.856
you could have
a billion-dollar
idea if you listen to me.

27:40.592 --> 27:41.761
Sleep on it.

27:43.462 --> 27:45.097
I'm pretty sure
this is the right way to go.

27:51.070 --> 27:52.104
I'll catch up
with you later.

27:57.810 --> 27:58.945
What?

27:59.979 --> 28:01.914
You need
to have more respect

28:02.048 --> 28:03.816
for the work Jordan and I
have put in.

28:03.950 --> 28:05.885
I-I suggested
a few upgrades.

28:06.018 --> 28:07.353
Did not sound
like a suggestion.

28:08.955 --> 28:10.156
Sorry.

28:10.289 --> 28:11.958
And you really pissed off
Jordan.

28:12.091 --> 28:13.826
Maybe she's being just
a little bit too sensitive?

28:15.161 --> 28:16.128
You did not
just say that.

28:17.163 --> 28:19.031
Mm.

28:19.165 --> 28:21.700
Are we "ladies" being
too sensitive?

28:21.834 --> 28:23.069
Yeah, I-I don't know
what's happening here.

28:23.202 --> 28:26.338
Are you offended because I
referred to you as "ladies"?

28:26.472 --> 28:28.507
I'm offended
by your overbearing attitude.

28:28.640 --> 28:32.311
Okay. FYI, if two men walked
into my office right now

28:32.444 --> 28:35.514
and presented to me this
particular business plan,

28:35.647 --> 28:37.149
I wouldn't have acted
any differently!

28:38.851 --> 28:39.852
Okay.

28:41.854 --> 28:44.690
What? I just--
I'm trying to help.

28:44.824 --> 28:46.725
I have experience.
I have knowledge.

28:46.859 --> 28:48.060
I know the marketplace.

28:48.194 --> 28:49.996
Maybe if you just listen
to the ideas

28:50.129 --> 28:53.900
instead of how the ideas
are being presented to you...

28:54.033 --> 28:55.902
Thanks. I didn't know how
I was supposed to feel

28:56.035 --> 28:57.169
until you explained it to me.

28:58.637 --> 29:00.672

29:04.043 --> 29:06.478
The cuirass is like
a wearable mini-Frank.

29:06.612 --> 29:08.447
You could use
a motorized wheelchair.

29:08.580 --> 29:09.782
You'd be mobile again.

29:09.916 --> 29:11.450
Think of all the lecture
invitations

29:11.583 --> 29:13.052
you've had to turn down.

29:13.185 --> 29:15.187
You could do
a college tour.

29:15.321 --> 29:16.722
We could go to Vegas.

29:16.856 --> 29:18.190
(CHUCKLES)

29:19.691 --> 29:21.660

29:24.096 --> 29:25.231
I don't want the surgery.

29:26.032 --> 29:28.200
****

29:31.303 --> 29:32.104
The intubations
and rupture

29:32.238 --> 29:34.206
weakened
your respiratory system.

29:35.241 --> 29:36.208
I know.

29:37.743 --> 29:38.477
If...

29:40.546 --> 29:43.149
If you stay in Frank,
you'll only have a few months
left to live.

29:43.282 --> 29:45.885

29:46.018 --> 29:48.120
I just taught my last class.

29:50.089 --> 29:52.091
I published my final paper.

29:53.559 --> 29:56.062
And I got to spend
my final years with a--

29:57.129 --> 29:58.664
A pretty cool roommate.

29:59.431 --> 30:00.766

after you guys met
this morning.

32:55.374 --> 32:57.743

out of sorts.

32:57.876 --> 33:03.949
Yeah, I, um,
apparently offended
her and Lea,

33:04.083 --> 33:08.420
because I offered
an opinion
that was overbearing...

33:09.855 --> 33:12.424
And pushy.

33:12.558 --> 33:13.892
Hm.

33:14.026 --> 33:15.794
I believe the word
you're looking for
is "sexist."

33:15.927 --> 33:16.928
I wasn't looking
for that word.

33:17.063 --> 33:18.930
Well, you are.

33:19.065 --> 33:21.167
Men your age have spent
your whole lives

33:21.300 --> 33:23.835
being told you are the center
of the universe.

33:23.969 --> 33:28.174
You don't see the irony
in reducing me
to my age and my gender?

33:28.307 --> 33:29.841
You don't see the irony
in being more upset

33:29.975 --> 33:31.777
about being called a sexist
than being one?

33:31.910 --> 33:33.712
Okay. That's--
That's not irony, that--

33:36.748 --> 33:37.816

Good first step.
Right.

33:40.586 --> 33:42.088
My diagnosis--

33:42.221 --> 33:45.857
While some
of your symptoms overlap
with toxic masculinity,

33:45.991 --> 33:48.960
your real underlying issue
is boss syndrome,
which is very treatable.

33:51.130 --> 33:53.031
Shut up.
What?

33:53.165 --> 33:54.600
You're used to leading.

33:54.733 --> 33:57.236
Now you need to learn
how to be quiet,
listen, follow.

new experience for you.

Kevin started calling

because he wanted
to watch cartoons...

34:43.149 --> 34:44.416
And got his ass kicked.

34:44.550 --> 34:45.584
That doesn't make it okay

I keep trying to sell my aunt

35:22.688 --> 35:24.256

N-No.

Oh.

35:42.841 --> 35:43.775
We haven't decided yet.

35:50.849 --> 35:54.686
I made my documentary
because people like me

35:54.820 --> 35:56.788
need to know that someone
like Aunt Joan exists.

35:58.224 --> 36:00.426

There are people who need
to know you exist, Shaun.

Aunt Joanie.

Polio made your world
smaller,

36:40.131 --> 36:44.803
but you made the world bigger
for so many others

36:44.936 --> 36:47.473
by showing
what's possible.

36:50.909 --> 36:52.278
Hey, hey! There she is.
Hi, Joan.

36:52.411 --> 36:54.346

Oh! Wha--

Suzie? Is that--

36:57.483 --> 36:59.150
Oh, Jeffrey.

36:59.285 --> 37:01.219
All right, Suzie,
you're up.

37:01.353 --> 37:03.555
I was first in my family
to go to college.

37:03.689 --> 37:05.757
I was ready to drop out
freshman year

37:05.891 --> 37:07.726
until I took your seminar.

37:07.859 --> 37:10.562
Your courage inspired me
to come out.

37:10.696 --> 37:12.798
When I saw your movie,
I thought,

37:12.931 --> 37:16.001
"Her iron lung isn't ruling
her life.

37:16.134 --> 37:19.004
My depression
shouldn't rule mine."

37:19.137 --> 37:20.872
Made an appointment
with a therapist that day.

37:21.607 --> 37:22.841
Aww.

WOMAN: Every time I start
to say, "I can't,"

37:24.643 --> 37:25.777
I just think about how brave
you've been.

37:25.911 --> 37:28.013
I talked to my kids
about your bravery.

37:28.146 --> 37:30.382
They learned so much
from your story.

You didn't just teach me
physics.

You taught me about life.

Oh.

You've been in that machine

38:12.824 --> 38:17.195
You're scared of life outside
because it's new...

38:19.598 --> 38:23.735
Because it may make you
look back and realize
how much you've missed.

38:26.705 --> 38:30.008
You've overcome so much more
than most people.

38:31.042 --> 38:32.811
You found
your courage before.

No.

Thanks for coming.
I-I --

40:04.202 --> 40:05.837
Since the last time we met,
I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

40:07.338 --> 40:12.043
If this is gonna work,
there needs to be a change

40:12.177 --> 40:13.745
in the dynamic,
mostly on my part.

40:13.879 --> 40:15.847
And I-I'm not sure
I can do that,

40:16.915 --> 40:19.485
so maybe we should call it
a day.

40:22.721 --> 40:24.055
That's it?

40:24.189 --> 40:25.857
Of course I'll give you
the endorsement.

40:27.158 --> 40:28.760
You're gonna give up
on us?

40:28.894 --> 40:31.262
I...thought you said
you didn't want a partner.

40:33.331 --> 40:35.066
It took me a while
to get past the attitude,

40:36.001 --> 40:37.035
but you were right.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.439
We could use
your code to power
three different sensors.

40:41.573 --> 40:43.374
We could sell it as a set
or a la carte.

40:44.610 --> 40:45.577

You are beautiful,

lucky enough
to marry a woman like you.

41:42.233 --> 41:43.769
Mmm.

41:43.902 --> 41:46.838
But you don't want to do it,
and that is okay.

Shaun,
you have inspired me,
