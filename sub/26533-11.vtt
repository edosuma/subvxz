00:01.131 --> 00:02.698
Previously onCharmed...

00:02.741 --> 00:04.874
HARRY:
I found out who I really was,

00:04.917 --> 00:07.485
and I caused the death
of my only child.

00:07.529 --> 00:09.879
He's still alive.

00:09.922 --> 00:11.881
The Elders are only looking out
for themselves.

00:11.924 --> 00:13.839
I trust you.

00:15.972 --> 00:18.279
She was sequencing
your DNA.

00:18.322 --> 00:19.758
MACY:
They don't share a father.

00:19.802 --> 00:22.326
Maggie and I do.

00:43.739 --> 00:45.436
You break it,
you buy it, my friend.

00:48.744 --> 00:51.790
Let me guess,
art collector?

00:51.834 --> 00:54.097
I wish.

00:54.141 --> 00:58.362
Just a music teacher with
a soft spot for antiquities.

01:03.846 --> 01:07.850
Is that a pitch pipe?

01:07.893 --> 01:08.938
Believe so.

01:08.981 --> 01:12.898
Washed up the coast
a few months back.

01:12.942 --> 01:15.814
I've never seen anything
quite like it.

01:15.858 --> 01:18.774
This must date back
at least 3,000 years.

01:20.819 --> 01:24.171
Welcome to Greece.

01:24.214 --> 01:27.261
I'll be right back.

01:49.326 --> 01:50.719
Ah!

02:10.608 --> 02:11.870
Hmm.

02:13.829 --> 02:17.006
Much better.

02:25.884 --> 02:27.843
MAGGIE:
♪ I'm walking on sunshine

02:27.886 --> 02:30.541
♪ Whoa

02:30.585 --> 02:34.415
♪ I'm walking
on sunshine, whoa ♪

02:34.458 --> 02:36.025
♪ And don't it
feel good? ♪

02:36.068 --> 02:38.419
Not that I am not loving
the morning soundtrack,

02:38.462 --> 02:39.811
but don't you usually
confine your fantasies

02:39.855 --> 02:41.813
of winning The Voice
to the shower?

02:41.857 --> 02:45.034
I'm kind of auditioning
for the Hilltones today.

02:45.077 --> 02:48.037
The a cappella group?
Good for you.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.995
Yeah, I guess some people
dropped out after winter break,

02:50.039 --> 02:52.911
and they have a big
show coming up, so...

02:52.955 --> 02:55.087
That's great.It was Harry's idea.

02:55.131 --> 02:57.438
He thought I should do something
fun and life-affirming after...

02:57.481 --> 02:59.091
Finding out your
boyfriend's a demon

02:59.135 --> 03:02.269
and you being tortured
in Hell's prison? Yeah.

03:02.312 --> 03:06.403
MAGGIE: ♪ I'm walking
on sunshine, whoa. ♪

03:10.799 --> 03:13.932
Oh, I hope Harry finds something
like that for himself.

03:13.976 --> 03:15.586
He seems depressed
or something, right?

03:15.630 --> 03:16.892
Yeah.

03:19.764 --> 03:22.854
Authentic English breakfast!

03:22.898 --> 03:25.335
How extremely sweet.

03:25.379 --> 03:26.684
Make sure you actually
eat it this time.

03:26.728 --> 03:28.686
Oh, you mustn't worry about me.

03:28.730 --> 03:30.210
I'm recovering just fine.

03:30.253 --> 03:31.907
I've got my reading.

03:31.950 --> 03:34.605
Just taking a bit to get
my appetite back.

03:34.649 --> 03:35.911
I heard you
practicing

03:35.954 --> 03:37.913
your audition piece
out there. Sublime.

03:37.956 --> 03:40.959
Thank you, Harry.
Hi.

03:41.003 --> 03:44.615
Can I talk to you both?
Downstairs?

03:44.659 --> 03:46.748
Let's hope you're all
coming to your senses

03:46.791 --> 03:48.532
and will allow me
to wipe Galvin's memory

03:48.576 --> 03:50.578
as soon as I'm well.

03:50.621 --> 03:52.493
I know firsthand
how dangerous it can be

03:52.536 --> 03:54.059
to let a human know the truth.

03:54.103 --> 03:55.365
We've been
over this, Harry.

03:55.409 --> 03:56.627
Yeah, Macy trusts Galvin.

03:56.671 --> 03:59.369
So do we.
Understood.

04:11.512 --> 04:14.297
There's nothing more we
can do to save your son.

04:20.782 --> 04:22.740
Ah...

04:25.047 --> 04:26.527
MEL:
What am I looking at?

04:26.570 --> 04:28.137
Chromosomes.

04:28.180 --> 04:30.095
Yeah. This here
is the chromatid,

04:30.139 --> 04:31.662
and that right there
is the centromere.

04:31.706 --> 04:33.360
No offense, Mace, but
I kind of have a busy day.

04:33.403 --> 04:35.797
Okay, uh...

04:35.840 --> 04:37.189
I'm just-- I'm trying
to work up the courage

04:37.233 --> 04:38.800
to tell you both something.

04:38.843 --> 04:41.672
Macy, just spit it out,
we're your sisters.Yeah.

04:43.631 --> 04:46.808
Yes. Okay.

04:46.851 --> 04:48.853
Ray's not your father.

04:48.897 --> 04:51.247
My dad's your real dad,
and-and so we're full sisters.

04:52.727 --> 04:55.033
And you're only half.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.039
Th... That's impossible.

05:01.083 --> 05:05.174
I-It's not. Really.
It's-it's right here.

05:05.217 --> 05:07.307
The test is 100%
reproducible.

05:07.350 --> 05:08.917
I checked it twice myself.

05:08.960 --> 05:11.528
Not to mention DNA is about
as definitive as it gets.

05:11.572 --> 05:13.748
It's what carries all of our
genetic information.

05:13.791 --> 05:15.880
Where did the DNA
even come from?

05:15.924 --> 05:19.144
Dr. Julia and the lab stole it,
and I'm pretty sure Parker lied

05:19.188 --> 05:22.757
about needing a
transfusion from you.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.716
Nice. Great job, Macy.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.544
What? You told me
to spit out the news.

05:27.588 --> 05:29.764
I didn't know this
was the news.

05:29.807 --> 05:32.157
So now you're blaming me
for the nature of the news?

05:32.201 --> 05:35.247
This can't be happening.
This is... not happening.

05:35.291 --> 05:37.119
Oh, I know,
but look at it like this,

05:37.162 --> 05:38.773
this all must be connected.

05:38.816 --> 05:40.905
Us not growing up together,
Mom giving me up,

05:40.949 --> 05:44.344
this secret about
my dad being your dad.

05:46.258 --> 05:47.999
So, Maggie, I think
you should call Ray

05:48.043 --> 05:50.088
and find out if he knows
that he's not really

05:50.132 --> 05:52.308
your dad, and it could help us
piece it all together.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.223
Don't ask her to do that, after
all that she's been through.

05:54.266 --> 05:55.659
Oh, stop using me
against her.

05:55.703 --> 05:57.095
You don't even know
how I feel about this.

05:57.139 --> 05:59.010
See? You don't always
know what she wants.

05:59.054 --> 06:00.403
Oh, my God, and
neither do you.

06:01.926 --> 06:03.188
Like I definitely
did not want

06:03.232 --> 06:04.364
to have this
dropped on me

06:04.407 --> 06:05.843
right before my audition
and right after

06:05.887 --> 06:08.193
I literally
escaped from Hell.

06:10.326 --> 06:12.850
Every man in my life
betrays me.

06:12.894 --> 06:15.462
Parker, Ray, the non-dad who
never showed up for Christmas

06:15.505 --> 06:18.247
and now your dad, Macy--

06:18.290 --> 06:20.249
the non-dad who never
even cared to meet me.

06:20.292 --> 06:22.643
Well, I'm-- You know,
we don't know the whole story.

06:22.686 --> 06:27.604
We know Mom lied about you
and about Maggie's dad

06:27.648 --> 06:29.476
and about us
being witches.

06:29.519 --> 06:34.437
So the whole story is that our
mother was a compulsive liar,

06:34.481 --> 06:36.352
and we never really
knew her at all.

06:36.396 --> 06:40.791
Or... this is a huge clue

06:40.835 --> 06:43.403
that could help illuminate why
Mom did things the way she did.

06:43.446 --> 06:45.448
Just look on the bright side.

06:45.492 --> 06:48.886
Stop trying to control
our reactions to this, Macy.

06:48.930 --> 06:50.627
We can feel
how we feel, okay?

06:50.671 --> 06:52.412
Look, I'm sorry that I don't
know how to tell someone

06:52.455 --> 06:54.152
their dad's not their dad.
I just-- I thought

06:54.196 --> 06:55.589
that Maggie would want to know.

06:55.632 --> 06:57.417
And why Mom did
what she did is something

06:57.460 --> 06:59.027
that I really want
to figure out.

06:59.070 --> 07:02.073
Our lives are not data you can
arrange so that it makes sense.

07:03.292 --> 07:06.904
And now I'm
late for work.

07:06.948 --> 07:08.471
I'm late, too.

07:08.515 --> 07:10.691

Brava.

08:33.251 --> 08:36.820
Exactly the deep emotion
I'm looking for.

08:36.864 --> 08:39.257
Welcome to The Hilltones.

08:39.301 --> 08:41.956
With your help,
we're going to kill it.

08:53.358 --> 08:56.492
So what did they do?

08:56.536 --> 08:58.799
I mean,
they-they took it

08:58.842 --> 09:01.541
all out on me. Yeah, apparently
I didn't deliver the news

09:01.584 --> 09:04.152
in exactly the right way, like
there's some kind of rule book

09:04.195 --> 09:06.458
for something like that, and now
I'm the world's worst sister.

09:06.502 --> 09:07.895
Wait, so-so is that
what they think,

09:07.938 --> 09:09.287
or is that what you think?

09:09.331 --> 09:13.030
Does it make a difference
if it's true?

09:13.074 --> 09:15.859
Sorry, Mace.

09:15.903 --> 09:17.818
You know what?
I'm fine.

09:17.861 --> 09:20.342
More than fine.
I'm... exhilarated

09:20.385 --> 09:24.302
by the possibility of finding
some answers once and for all.

09:25.608 --> 09:28.829
Is that why you're
stress juicing?

09:28.872 --> 09:30.744
No, no, no.

09:30.787 --> 09:32.615
That's not what this is.
No, see, my sisters,

09:32.659 --> 09:35.618
they don't want to face
the facts, but the truth

09:35.662 --> 09:37.185
is still out there.

09:37.228 --> 09:39.883
So...

09:39.927 --> 09:43.234
I'm doing a spell

09:43.278 --> 09:44.975
to reveal hidden secrets.

09:46.803 --> 09:48.196
"Full disclosure,

09:48.239 --> 09:51.982
drop the shield,
all the secrets be revealed."

09:52.026 --> 09:54.376
Whoa!
Whoa!

09:54.419 --> 09:55.986
Macy, look out!

10:03.951 --> 10:05.561
Oh, my God.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.346
This is my dad's handwriting.

10:11.175 --> 10:12.481
Your dad was writing
to your mom?

10:12.524 --> 10:16.180
These go back years.

10:16.224 --> 10:18.487
My dad died that April.

10:18.530 --> 10:22.143
My parents were
in touch all along.

10:35.678 --> 10:38.942
Maggie?
Oh!

10:38.986 --> 10:41.249
What are you doing here?

10:41.292 --> 10:43.164
I promise I'm not stalking you.

10:43.207 --> 10:45.645
I didn't even know
you were a Hilltone.

10:46.994 --> 10:50.214
Look, if this is gonna
be awkward, I...

10:50.258 --> 10:51.302
I can just leave.

10:51.346 --> 10:53.522
Are you all right?

10:55.655 --> 10:57.395
I guess.

10:57.439 --> 11:00.442
Is this about Parker?
I heard that you guys...

11:00.485 --> 11:02.226
He's a monster and I never
want to see him again.

11:02.270 --> 11:06.448
Oh. Well, I'm sorry.

11:06.491 --> 11:08.406
And I'm not gonna stop
you from being here,

11:08.450 --> 11:10.800
just as long as you don't
try and get that solo,

11:10.844 --> 11:13.411
because it is all mine.

11:14.935 --> 11:16.284
Deal.

11:16.327 --> 11:17.851
EFFIE: Delusional
much, Lucy?

11:19.374 --> 11:22.812
You are not gonna throw me
off my game, Effie.

11:22.856 --> 11:25.685
Oh, I know.

11:25.728 --> 11:28.513
♪ You can't be thrown off
your game ♪

11:28.557 --> 11:30.733
♪ If you don't have any

11:30.777 --> 11:34.694
♪ That solo is mine.

11:36.739 --> 11:39.176
Hmm.
Ah.

11:39.220 --> 11:42.484
Unforch, the reality
check is that that betch,

11:42.527 --> 11:44.486
she does get the
solo every year.

11:44.529 --> 11:46.749
But ya girl is about
to change that.

11:46.793 --> 11:49.143
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

11:49.186 --> 11:51.754
MR. MIRANDA:
Songbirds.

11:51.798 --> 11:54.104
In anticipation
of our upcoming performance,

11:54.148 --> 11:55.453
I have brought you

11:55.497 --> 11:58.500
a little something
to ready your throats.

11:58.543 --> 12:00.763
EFFIE:
Uh, what is that?

12:00.807 --> 12:04.245
My vocal coach has me on
a strict honey-lemon regimen.

12:04.288 --> 12:05.594
Your vocal coach

12:05.637 --> 12:07.770
sounds like a small town hack.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.859
This is a
soothing tea,

12:09.903 --> 12:11.426
a proven formula.

12:11.469 --> 12:13.602
Proven to whom?

12:13.645 --> 12:17.040
Mr. Miranda has been
killing it fashion-wise

12:17.084 --> 12:21.523
since his trip to Greece, but
he's also gotten a lot weirder.

12:21.566 --> 12:24.308
Artists are eccentric.

12:24.352 --> 12:26.049
And I have two words
for you, Effie:

12:26.093 --> 12:28.008
Kelly Clarkson.

12:28.051 --> 12:29.618
Oh.

12:29.661 --> 12:31.663
Thank you.

12:35.276 --> 12:37.060
Mm.

12:40.237 --> 12:41.456
Hi.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.241
Hey.

12:44.285 --> 12:46.504
Okay, so I-I didn't handle
the dad news very well,

12:46.548 --> 12:47.810
I admit that.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.507
I-It's fine. What are those?

12:49.551 --> 12:53.337
They're letters
between our parents.

12:53.381 --> 12:56.471
They were in touch all along and
madly in love with each other.

12:56.514 --> 12:57.907
I thought you might want
to read them with me.

12:57.951 --> 13:00.475
In love for decades?

13:00.518 --> 13:02.564
Behind Ray's back? I...

13:02.607 --> 13:04.740
I mean, what, am I supposed
to be happy about that?

13:04.784 --> 13:06.481
Well, none of this is
particularly happy about

13:06.524 --> 13:09.136
any of this,
but I just thought...

13:09.179 --> 13:11.573
What's going on?Nothing-- much, just

13:11.616 --> 13:13.880
asking Maggie about
her singing thing.

13:13.923 --> 13:16.970
Unlike our mother, Macy,
you're a terrible liar.

13:17.013 --> 13:18.493
Fine, it's about my dad,

13:18.536 --> 13:19.886
and I know you don't want
to hear about it.

13:19.929 --> 13:22.932
Okay. Got to go.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.026
I-I got to go, too.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.335
MEL:
Can we talk?

13:35.815 --> 13:37.381
What's going on?

13:37.425 --> 13:39.253
Well,

13:39.296 --> 13:40.907
I found out our mom
was lying to us

13:40.950 --> 13:43.779
about some pretty big,
non-witchy stuff.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.302
And I thought we were close.

13:45.346 --> 13:47.914
But were we really,
if I knew so little about her?

13:47.957 --> 13:50.307
And it got me thinking,
I don't want to do the same

13:50.351 --> 13:52.570
to the people that I like.

13:52.614 --> 13:54.137
Like you.

13:56.052 --> 13:57.837
And I'm fully prepared
for you to hate me

13:57.880 --> 14:00.709
and never want to see me again
after I say this.

14:00.752 --> 14:02.798
Okay...

14:02.842 --> 14:05.888
I was originally sent
to the Sarcana by the Elders,

14:05.932 --> 14:08.064
to infiltrate you because
we all thought the Sarcana

14:08.108 --> 14:09.849
killed our mother
and-- but now I know

14:09.892 --> 14:10.850
that they didn't.

14:10.893 --> 14:12.590
So there you have it.

14:12.634 --> 14:14.375
The whole truth.

14:14.418 --> 14:18.248
I was wondering
when you were gonna come clean.

14:19.336 --> 14:20.860
It didn't take a genius
to figure out

14:20.903 --> 14:22.862
you probably had
ulterior motives.

14:22.905 --> 14:26.082
Besides, Maggie's not the only
witch that can read minds.

14:26.126 --> 14:28.084
We have an empath, too.

14:28.128 --> 14:30.695
So why not call me out
on it, then?

14:30.739 --> 14:33.089
Because I saw you had potential,

14:33.133 --> 14:35.875
and I knew you'd come
to see things our way.

14:35.918 --> 14:37.180
It was only a matter of time

14:37.224 --> 14:39.095
before the Elders' methods
turned you off.

14:39.139 --> 14:44.057
So, now that you know
everything,

14:44.100 --> 14:46.624
I want to know everything.

14:46.668 --> 14:48.931
What exactly is it
that you guys do?

14:48.975 --> 14:50.977
If you're really ready,

14:51.020 --> 14:53.501
why don't you tag along with me
tomorrow night,

14:53.544 --> 14:55.503
see for yourself?

15:03.206 --> 15:06.383
♪ I came to see him

15:06.427 --> 15:10.257
♪ To listen for a while

15:13.260 --> 15:18.787
♪ And there he was,
this young boy ♪

15:18.830 --> 15:23.009
♪ A stranger to my eyes

15:23.052 --> 15:28.014
♪ Strumming my pain
with his fingers ♪

15:28.057 --> 15:31.060
♪ Singing my life
with his words... ♪Stop!

15:31.104 --> 15:32.975
Stop! Stop.

15:34.281 --> 15:36.500
Your histrionics
are ruining my arrangement.

15:36.544 --> 15:38.502
Your arrangement is weird.

15:38.546 --> 15:40.983
It's all... creepy.

15:41.027 --> 15:43.638
No. No, no.

15:43.681 --> 15:45.988
You don't understand.

15:46.032 --> 15:49.209
Dissonant harmonies
capture powerful emotions.

15:49.252 --> 15:51.211
They move audiences,

15:51.254 --> 15:55.302
they, uh, transfix them.

15:58.783 --> 16:00.785
She understands.

16:02.439 --> 16:05.051
Your voice

16:05.094 --> 16:09.055
reminds me
of the great potoo bird's call

16:09.098 --> 16:14.277
before it pounces on a bat
and tears it apart.

16:15.931 --> 16:21.371
Her emotion highlights
the poignancy of my arrangement

16:21.415 --> 16:23.156
and draws
the audience in.

16:23.199 --> 16:24.853
They will surrender
to the song,

16:24.896 --> 16:26.376
and by the end,

16:26.420 --> 16:28.465
they won't know
what hit them.

16:28.509 --> 16:34.167
Rather than distracting them
with subpar Aguilera circa 2001

16:34.210 --> 16:36.517
vocal parkour.

16:46.396 --> 16:48.181
Everybody,

16:48.224 --> 16:50.444
follow Maggie's lead.

16:50.487 --> 16:52.272
Back from the top.

16:52.315 --> 16:54.187
EFFIE: I'll die before
this newbie steals my solo.

16:54.230 --> 16:58.191
Can we just try a
more upbeat version?

16:58.234 --> 17:01.324
I really think it will
better showcase my talent--

17:01.368 --> 17:03.283
I-I mean, our talent.

17:03.326 --> 17:06.112
MR. MIRANDA:
I am afraid I need to cut you.

17:06.155 --> 17:09.419
Cut me? I'm the best singer
you've got.

17:09.463 --> 17:12.248
I don't know who you think you
are, talking to me like that.

17:12.292 --> 17:15.295
Wait a minute.
Of course.

17:15.338 --> 17:17.297
You're a singer,
you're all the same.

17:17.340 --> 17:18.907
Always making it about you,

17:18.950 --> 17:21.518
never following
your director's lead.

17:21.562 --> 17:23.042
Well, you know what they say.

17:23.085 --> 17:25.348
Those who can't do, teach.

17:26.349 --> 17:29.352
Look, I-I get it.

17:29.396 --> 17:32.225
I know it's not all about me,
i-it's about the group.

17:32.268 --> 17:34.314
No. It's not about the group.

17:34.357 --> 17:36.577
It's about me.

18:19.446 --> 18:21.752
Is it creepy that
I think I know exactly

18:21.796 --> 18:23.276
when Maggie was conceived?

18:23.319 --> 18:25.408
Oh, really?
Mm-hmm.

18:25.452 --> 18:30.674
They spent a weekend together,
New Year's Eve, 2000.

18:30.718 --> 18:32.676
So he knew about Maggie.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.461
He knew Marisol was a witch.

18:34.504 --> 18:37.551
This is, this is just bombshell
after bombshell in here.

18:37.594 --> 18:39.770
Yeah. But Maggie's
still not interested?

18:42.295 --> 18:45.124
My bombshells are landing about
as gently as actual bombs.

18:53.697 --> 18:55.395
Oh, my gosh.

18:56.700 --> 18:59.486
Uh, oh. W-What-- what, now?

18:59.529 --> 19:03.098
No, he's describing
my tenth birthday party.

19:03.142 --> 19:07.189
I remember that day
like it was yesterday.

19:07.233 --> 19:11.367
And how much I wanted
my mom there.

19:11.411 --> 19:14.936
I guess, in some way, she was.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.813
I was really lonely.

19:24.902 --> 19:28.906
I didn't know I had sisters.

19:28.950 --> 19:31.909
Maggie was a baby.
Mel would have been seven.

19:31.953 --> 19:34.434
They could have been there.

19:34.477 --> 19:37.306
Can you imagine that?

19:39.439 --> 19:41.919
Yeah, well, they're here now.

19:44.270 --> 19:47.621
I know. I know, but...

19:47.664 --> 19:50.493
if my dad knew about Maggie,

19:50.537 --> 19:53.279
i-if he knew about magic
and it-it didn't matter,

19:53.322 --> 19:56.847
he loved Marisol regardless,
then why?

19:56.891 --> 20:00.242
Why couldn't we be together?

20:00.286 --> 20:02.462
As a family.

20:09.991 --> 20:11.471
Hey.

20:11.514 --> 20:14.952
Is Mr. Miranda's
super sad arranging

20:14.996 --> 20:16.476
bumming you out, too?

20:16.519 --> 20:19.261
No, it's family drama.

20:19.305 --> 20:20.958
I-I don't want to bore you.

20:21.002 --> 20:22.438
Are you kidding?

20:22.482 --> 20:25.615
I have a natural thirst
for family dramz.

20:25.659 --> 20:28.357
I'm just in a really weird place
with my sisters right now.

20:28.401 --> 20:32.056
Oh...I mean, I didn't even
invite them to the show.

20:32.100 --> 20:36.539
And I just feel like I have all
these complicated relationships,

20:36.583 --> 20:41.457
and... I just wish my life
weren't so messy, you know?

20:41.501 --> 20:43.764
Oh, please. Messy
is the new normal.

20:43.807 --> 20:45.766
Like, remember Coco,
the CrossFit instructor

20:45.809 --> 20:47.507
my dad left my mom for?

20:47.550 --> 20:49.944
He understands me more
than either of my parents.

20:49.987 --> 20:51.946
Which may be because
we're so close in age.

20:51.989 --> 20:54.383
But so what?
It works, you know?

20:54.427 --> 20:56.298
Like Coco always says,

20:56.342 --> 20:59.301
a hot mess is better than no
hotness at all.

21:01.042 --> 21:05.220
Point bees,
all families are complicated.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.613
Thanks, Lucy.

21:06.656 --> 21:08.267
MR. MIRANDA:
Warming up, ladies.

21:16.275 --> 21:20.366
All right.

21:20.409 --> 21:22.106
Wait, where's Effie?

21:22.150 --> 21:23.978
Well, she has quit the group.

21:24.021 --> 21:25.893
What?
I knew she didn't
have it in her.

21:25.936 --> 21:27.677
Then who's gonna sing the solo?

21:27.721 --> 21:29.331
Wait.

21:29.375 --> 21:33.466
♪ Strumming my pain
with his fingers ♪

21:33.509 --> 21:35.685
♪ Singing my life...

21:35.729 --> 21:37.426
Sure, the solo
is now yours, Lucy.

21:37.470 --> 21:39.254
Thank you so much.From the top.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.560
Wait, Effie really quit?

21:42.388 --> 21:43.867
I mean, that just
doesn't sound like her.

21:43.911 --> 21:45.304
The Hilltones
are her life.

21:45.347 --> 21:49.003
Well, some people simply
cannot handle the pressure.

21:49.046 --> 21:50.396
MAGGIE:
But why now?

21:50.439 --> 21:52.615
She's always
had the solo.
Maggie, drop it.

21:52.659 --> 21:53.964
I got the solo.

21:54.008 --> 21:56.097
Thank you so much, Mr. Miranda.

21:56.140 --> 21:58.621
I'm gonna make you so proud.Excuse me!

22:00.057 --> 22:02.886
This is an extremely valuable
and delicate antique.

22:02.930 --> 22:04.845
LUCY:
Okay.

22:04.888 --> 22:07.282
It's so pretty.
Can I see it?

22:07.326 --> 22:09.545
EFFIE: Help me!No!

22:09.589 --> 22:11.417
Didn't you hear me?

22:11.460 --> 22:14.202
This is extremely delicate.

22:32.438 --> 22:34.353
Is everything
all right?

22:36.703 --> 22:38.487
Maggie has this
concert tonight

22:38.531 --> 22:41.490
and she didn't invite me,
which feels really weird.

22:43.753 --> 22:44.754
I don't know,
I just-I just think

22:44.798 --> 22:46.103
that she needs
some space right now.

22:46.147 --> 22:50.586
I can be overbearing
when I mean to be protective.

22:50.630 --> 22:52.414
I've always been
her big sister.

22:52.458 --> 22:55.417
Although now,
we both have a big sister.

22:55.461 --> 22:56.549
I get that.

22:56.592 --> 22:59.160
I'm sorry. That sucks.

23:00.466 --> 23:02.076
You know what?

23:02.119 --> 23:03.904
Let's not talk
about this right now.

23:03.947 --> 23:06.515
We are here
on a Sarcana mission.

23:06.559 --> 23:07.908
Mmm.

23:07.951 --> 23:09.344
Where is our mission, anyway?

23:09.388 --> 23:13.087
Le douchebag in question
should be here any minute.

23:13.130 --> 23:16.003
He's, like, your typical
entitled predator.
Hmm.

23:16.046 --> 23:18.179
The sexual assault charges
got dismissed

23:18.222 --> 23:20.050
'cause the judge didn't want
to ruin his "promising future."

23:20.094 --> 23:21.878
That makes me sick.

23:21.922 --> 23:23.097
These pervs, man.

23:23.140 --> 23:25.752
They don't give up easily.

23:25.795 --> 23:29.059
Except now we'll be here
to stop them.

23:29.103 --> 23:30.757
I'll be right back.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.149
Okay.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.936
NIKO: Hey. Glass
of Pinot Gris.

23:43.247 --> 23:45.336
Hi, Mel. I'm Niko.

23:45.380 --> 23:47.556
I was hoping
we could talk.

23:55.346 --> 23:56.913
How do you know my name?

23:56.957 --> 23:58.524
You work here, right?

23:58.567 --> 23:59.786
I've seen you around.

23:59.829 --> 24:02.223
I'm off tonight,
but yes. Yeah.

24:02.266 --> 24:04.225
Uh, and you,
do you live in town?

24:04.268 --> 24:06.096
Uh, let's just say
I'm here on business.

24:06.140 --> 24:08.185
BARTENDER: Here you are.
Enjoy.Thank you.

24:08.229 --> 24:10.492
So you work here

24:10.536 --> 24:12.494
and you're... a student?

24:12.538 --> 24:14.714
I was, but, uh,

24:14.757 --> 24:16.585
I had to drop out
for personal reasons.

24:16.629 --> 24:18.457
Hmm.
How about you?

24:18.500 --> 24:19.719
What do you do?

24:19.762 --> 24:21.111
You could say I help people.

24:21.155 --> 24:23.636
Huh.
Get them out
of dangerous situations.

24:23.679 --> 24:25.202
Like your friend Jada.

24:25.246 --> 24:26.943
What do you know about Jada?

24:26.987 --> 24:28.292
There are people who love her

24:28.336 --> 24:29.859
who are really concerned
for her safety.

24:29.903 --> 24:31.252
They're worried she might be
getting involved

24:31.295 --> 24:32.514
with a dangerous group.

24:32.558 --> 24:34.734
A cult. Would you know
anything about that?

24:36.126 --> 24:38.215
Mel, I know
I'm a complete stranger,

24:38.259 --> 24:40.304
but you may also be at risk.

24:40.348 --> 24:42.829
If Jada's trying to get you
to be a part of this group...

24:42.872 --> 24:44.526
She's not.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.093
And I'm fine.

24:47.355 --> 24:49.357
If you hear or see
anything strange,

24:49.400 --> 24:51.664
if you ever
feel unsafe...

24:51.707 --> 24:53.666
give me a call.

24:53.709 --> 24:55.711
Okay.

25:02.413 --> 25:04.241
Douchebag at two o'clock.

25:08.289 --> 25:10.117
You okay?
Mm-hmm.

25:10.160 --> 25:11.771
Who was that chick
you were talking to?

25:11.814 --> 25:13.120
She's nobody.

25:14.687 --> 25:16.123
MACY:
Maggie, we're here.

25:16.166 --> 25:17.428
Magical pitch pipes.

25:19.256 --> 25:21.432
Oh, no way. Yo,
that is sick.

25:21.476 --> 25:23.478
You see? This makes me
extremely nervous.

25:23.522 --> 25:26.176
It's absolutely against protocol
for him to be involved in this.

25:26.220 --> 25:27.874
No offense, Galvin.I know, but we
don't have time

25:27.917 --> 25:29.876
to discuss that right now.
Look, it's here.

25:29.919 --> 25:31.486
Oh, this matches the photo
you sent, Maggie.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.661
MACY:
The mystiki flauto.

25:32.705 --> 25:34.837
According to legend,
it originally belonged

25:34.881 --> 25:36.056
to the sirens of ancient Greece.

25:36.099 --> 25:37.666
Oh, we read about them
in World Lit.

25:37.710 --> 25:38.798
They're the women
who lured sailors

25:38.841 --> 25:40.277
to their death through song.

25:40.321 --> 25:41.670
And you're saying
they're a real thing?

25:41.714 --> 25:43.542
Apparently so.

25:43.585 --> 25:44.847
Their favorite melody was
something called

25:44.891 --> 25:46.022
"The Devil's Tritone."

25:46.066 --> 25:47.894
Diminished fifth.
Look, I know it.

25:47.937 --> 25:49.243
You do?

25:49.286 --> 25:50.636
I'm from New Orleans.

25:50.679 --> 25:52.768
Got some jazz musicians
in my extended family.

25:55.336 --> 25:58.034
Miranda is a siren and I think
he did something to Effie.

25:58.078 --> 25:59.906
When I touched the pipe,
I heard her screams.

25:59.949 --> 26:03.170
If sirens lure people
to their deaths... wait.

26:03.213 --> 26:05.999
Is he trying to kill
the audience through a song?

26:06.042 --> 26:07.957
But sirens are
female, right?

26:08.001 --> 26:11.004
Typically, but gender
can be fluid, as we have learnt.

26:11.047 --> 26:12.179
Maggie, we're on our way.

26:12.222 --> 26:13.920

Oh, my powers...

26:20.274 --> 26:21.797
They're not working?No.

26:21.841 --> 26:24.583
A consequence of my, uh,
time in Tartarus, no doubt.

26:24.626 --> 26:27.107
Find a
siren vanquishing spell

26:27.150 --> 26:28.761
and text it to Maggie, quickly.Oh.

26:28.804 --> 26:30.980

about to start.

26:33.504 --> 26:34.810
So, what's the plan?

26:34.854 --> 26:37.073
Just wait.

26:42.992 --> 26:45.429
: Disgusting. That
guy's about to drug that girl.

26:45.473 --> 26:47.475
Not to worry.

27:02.577 --> 27:05.536
Justice now,

The sirens were

30:07.240 --> 30:08.937

Yes, that's it. The song
itself isn't killing people.

mournfulness of the singers

31:14.307 --> 31:16.135
can cause cavitation
in the inner ear.

of that,

what if we can cancel
out the frequency

31:22.445 --> 31:24.230

Maggie mentioned hearing
the singer scream

32:20.329 --> 32:22.288
when touching the pipe,
which got me thinking,

32:22.331 --> 32:25.247
the oldest writings on the
sirens refer to an unnamed rival

32:25.291 --> 32:26.509
who tried to usurp them,

32:26.553 --> 32:28.990
until they trapped him
in a Peripsych.

32:29.034 --> 32:30.992
E-Even I don't understand that.

32:31.036 --> 32:33.125
It's an object with the power
to extract a person's soul,

32:33.168 --> 32:35.562
or in this case,
a demon's primordial form,

32:35.605 --> 32:37.129
and bind it inside--
l-like a genie's lamp.

32:37.172 --> 32:38.434
Or a magical pitch pipe?

32:38.478 --> 32:39.696
Exactly.

32:39.740 --> 32:41.307
S-So the missing singer
is alive.

32:41.350 --> 32:43.265
One assumes, trapped inside
the pipe, likely with the soul

32:43.309 --> 32:45.659
of the original Mr. Miranda,
who may have had the misfortune

32:45.702 --> 32:48.314
of accidentally
releasing a demon.

32:48.357 --> 32:50.316
So if our Maestro
is this unnamed rival,

32:50.359 --> 32:51.578
how do we vanquish him

32:51.621 --> 32:53.188
so he doesn't do this again?

32:53.232 --> 32:55.321
First, you'll need the Power
of Three to return The Maestro

32:55.364 --> 32:57.627
to its primordial form.
I've contacted Mel, who should

32:57.671 --> 32:59.673
be arriving there shortly.
I'll text you the words.

32:59.716 --> 33:01.588
Then, you need to trap it
in the Peripsych

33:01.631 --> 33:03.720
by activating its unique key.

33:03.764 --> 33:05.287
If it were a genie's lamp,

33:05.331 --> 33:08.334
you'd rub it three times...

36:26.401 --> 36:28.403
Oh, no, they didn't.

All About Evecrap.

36:31.276 --> 36:33.321
I knew
they were all jealous of me,

36:33.365 --> 36:35.105
but this is not cool, guys.

36:35.149 --> 36:37.107
Not cool!

Yo, did... did I just vanquish
my first demon?

36:46.682 --> 36:49.685
Affirmative.

36:49.729 --> 36:52.775
Where...? Where am I?

36:52.819 --> 36:54.429
What happened?

36:54.473 --> 36:56.214
You're just a
little jet lagged.

36:56.257 --> 36:59.260
Your trip to Greece
really did a number on you.

36:59.304 --> 37:02.916
Come on. You're just
in time to take a bow.

37:12.404 --> 37:14.580
Niko looked good.
Happy, even.

37:14.623 --> 37:16.582
She didn't
recognize you at all?

37:16.625 --> 37:18.366
No.

37:18.410 --> 37:20.586
It reminded me that sometimes
we lie to protect people,

37:20.629 --> 37:23.458
and that doesn't mean
that we don't love them.

37:23.502 --> 37:26.113
I'm choosing to believe
that that's what Mom did.

37:26.156 --> 37:30.204
Hey, so, Macy--
those letters.

37:31.771 --> 37:33.947
I think I'm finally
ready to read them

37:33.990 --> 37:37.211
if you'd still, you know,
share them with me.

37:37.255 --> 37:39.344
Yes. They're up
in Mom's room.

37:39.387 --> 37:41.781
Do you want to come?

37:43.565 --> 37:46.742
I had you to myself
for 18 years.

37:46.786 --> 37:49.397
You guys should do this
on your own.

37:49.441 --> 37:51.834
And besides, there's something
else that I need to do.

37:51.878 --> 37:53.358
Thank you.

37:53.401 --> 37:55.534
Yeah.
Come.

37:55.577 --> 37:58.363
Okay.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.674
I have to tell you.

38:05.718 --> 38:09.069
The woman from the bar--
I think she's a PI

38:09.112 --> 38:10.940
who was hired
to track you down.

38:10.984 --> 38:12.638
She thinks
you're in a cult?

38:13.682 --> 38:16.642
That must be my parents.

38:16.685 --> 38:18.905
Thanks for telling me that.

38:20.689 --> 38:24.084
That's not the whole truth
I'm here to tell you, though.

38:24.127 --> 38:28.044
That woman from the bar--
she's not nobody.

38:28.088 --> 38:30.960
She's my ex.

38:31.004 --> 38:33.659
The PI is your ex?

38:33.702 --> 38:36.357
She wasn't a PI
when I knew her.

38:36.401 --> 38:38.968
Well, we've
all got a past.

38:43.146 --> 38:45.497
I got your message.

38:53.983 --> 38:56.159
Hey, what's wrong?

38:58.248 --> 39:01.382
Oh, this past week,

39:01.426 --> 39:04.429
I've been...

39:04.472 --> 39:07.083
distracted from my work.

39:07.127 --> 39:10.391
Oh, God,
did I make a mistake

39:10.435 --> 39:13.002
telling you
about your son?

39:13.046 --> 39:17.267
No. No. I've been writing down
every last detail I can recall

39:17.311 --> 39:19.400
from those memories
while they're still fresh.

39:19.444 --> 39:22.316
Anything that might
help me one day find him.

39:22.360 --> 39:27.408
Those are natural feelings
for a parent to have, hmm?

39:27.452 --> 39:31.064
But you know
your commitment--

39:31.107 --> 39:33.153
it has to be...To the Charmed Ones.

39:35.155 --> 39:37.157
Yes, I know.

39:38.724 --> 39:41.074
I'm...

39:41.117 --> 39:43.642
not the man I was
before Tartarus.

39:45.557 --> 39:47.820
And the slate's no longer
clean, you might say.

39:50.475 --> 39:53.652
The fact is,

39:53.695 --> 39:56.829
I'm not sure I can be
their Whitelighter anymore.

40:00.093 --> 40:02.443
They should be
in safer hands.

40:02.487 --> 40:05.664
But I know how much
you love them.

40:09.755 --> 40:14.542
Which is why the only
responsible thing to do...

40:14.586 --> 40:16.457
is to leave.

40:18.459 --> 40:22.507
Well, if you really
do feel that way,

40:22.550 --> 40:26.119
then... you need to tell them.

40:26.162 --> 40:28.121
Ah.

40:28.164 --> 40:30.079
You've always said
they're the closest thing

40:30.123 --> 40:32.125
to family
you've ever had.

40:34.475 --> 40:36.869
Until now.

40:36.912 --> 40:38.871
MACY:
What?

40:38.914 --> 40:40.525
Oh, my God,
did you see this?

40:40.568 --> 40:42.744
Only Macy Vaughn's father
could pull off the phrase

40:42.788 --> 40:44.398
"carnal cohabitation"
in a love letter.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.487
Man, he was not the
most expressive of men,

40:46.531 --> 40:48.750
but he was a good
father in his own way.Oh, my...

40:48.794 --> 40:50.709
I really wish
I could have known him.

40:50.752 --> 40:52.928
He would have had his
hands full with you.

40:52.972 --> 40:54.626
Excuse me!

40:54.669 --> 40:56.671
The hugging, the crying,

40:56.715 --> 40:58.717
the spontaneous
dance parties.

40:58.760 --> 41:00.893
No one can resist
my spontaneous dance parties.

41:00.936 --> 41:02.982
Yeah, Dexter Vaughn
could have.

41:03.025 --> 41:06.594
Oh, yeah, I would have
won him over.

41:06.638 --> 41:09.467
You definitely would have.

41:13.209 --> 41:15.647
What is it?

41:23.524 --> 41:25.787
"I don't regret what we
did, not for a minute,

41:25.831 --> 41:28.007
"but every time I look
at Macy, I'm reminded

41:28.050 --> 41:30.052
"that one day, she
will learn the truth.

41:30.096 --> 41:31.924
"And when she finds
out what we did to...

41:31.967 --> 41:35.014
bring her... back
from the dead..."

41:36.711 --> 41:39.018
"...I'm afraid she'll
never forgive us."
