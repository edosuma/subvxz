{\an8}that grew into huge arguments
for no reason.

11:15.408 --> 11:17.109

11:17.176 --> 11:18.577

11:18.644 --> 11:20.479
<i>I tried many,</i>

11:20.546 --> 11:22.548

11:22.615 --> 11:26.252
<i>I need to learn how to coexist</i>
<i>with her without any emotions</i>

11:26.318 --> 11:28.621

11:28.687 --> 11:32.224

11:34.293 --> 11:35.594
{\an8}<i>So this is what happened.</i>

11:35.661 --> 11:37.263
{\an9}So I told her point-blank
the weekend

11:37.329 --> 11:39.098
{\an9}before Valentine's Day,
"We're done."

11:39.165 --> 11:41.400
{\an1}So then I got on Tinder
right after,

11:41.467 --> 11:42.968
{\an3}and then she wanted to
come over on Valentine's Day

11:43.035 --> 11:44.136
to talk, and I'm like--

11:44.203 --> 11:45.571
- Oh, how convenient.
- Right?

11:45.638 --> 11:47.406
{\an1}- So she's like, "Mark,
I'm not leaving this house

11:47.473 --> 11:49.241
{\an3}because that's not what you do
when you love somebody.

11:49.308 --> 11:50.543
You just fight through it,"
and I'm like, "Okay, well,

11:50.609 --> 11:52.244
{\an3}I slept
with somebody last night."

11:52.311 --> 11:53.846
- Ooh.
- That might make her leave.

11:53.913 --> 11:55.448
- Oh, that's a drop.
- Yeah, she wasn't gonna leave.

11:55.514 --> 11:57.149
- Okay.
- So then she spread--then

11:57.216 --> 11:58.584
{\an3}she started telling
everybody I cheated on her

11:58.651 --> 12:00.019
{\an3}and broke up with her
on Valentine's Day.

12:00.086 --> 12:01.454
{\an8}- What?
- [bleep] right!

12:01.520 --> 12:03.622
{\an8}Mine and Elena's breakup
was very public.

12:03.689 --> 12:05.257
<i>Elena thought</i>
<i>we were on a break.</i>

12:05.324 --> 12:06.759
<i>We were not on a break.</i>

12:06.826 --> 12:10.729
{\an8}My ex likes to play victim
and make me feel bad

12:10.796 --> 12:13.032
{\an8}about trying to move on
with my life.

12:13.099 --> 12:14.266
{\an7}We broke up, like,
all the time,

12:14.333 --> 12:15.768
{\an7}but it would last
for a couple hours,

12:15.835 --> 12:16.836
{\an7}but I'm like,
"I'm done with you.

12:16.902 --> 12:18.471
{\an8}Like, I can't do this anymore."

12:18.537 --> 12:23.075
{\an8}- Mark has nothing to say
except for things about his ex.

12:23.142 --> 12:25.144
{\an9}- We fought so much,
and so it's just fight

12:25.211 --> 12:27.346

I can't do this.

{\an8}- He can't stop
talking about her.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.517
{\an9}- Like, we would fight.
I don't even know about what.

12:31.584 --> 12:32.985

12:38.724 --> 12:40.159
{\an3}If you love me this much,
I don't want to fight.

12:40.226 --> 12:41.694
{\an1}All she does is just yell

Anthony, how was
that date going?

You literally crashed the date?

up for "Vacation on the Beach"?

39:23.160 --> 39:25.830

"Ex by the Beach,"

39:25.896 --> 39:27.431
not "Ex by the Pool," so.

39:27.498 --> 39:30.534

Elena, looking over at you.
