01:09.969 --> 01:12.961
We should get moving. Got a big day.

01:13.773 --> 01:14.933
Okay.

01:33.159 --> 01:36.993
Sunday after Thanksgiving,
the busiest travel day of the year.

01:37.330 --> 01:41.096
Can you remind me again, Blair,
why you're traveling today?

01:44.270 --> 01:47.831
The year will fly by.
l'll be home next Christmas.

01:51.811 --> 01:54.712
-l love you, Mommy.
-Sweetheart.

01:55.014 --> 01:57.710
Enough of this. She's going to be fine.

01:58.485 --> 01:59.611
Daddy.

02:02.422 --> 02:03.821
l love you.

02:10.830 --> 02:12.161
Bye, honey.

02:16.402 --> 02:17.699
Love you.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.406
l love you.

02:34.654 --> 02:36.451
Think she'll be okay?

02:38.391 --> 02:42.191
-She'll be better than okay.
-l meant in Peru. ln the jungle.

02:42.529 --> 02:45.157
Please stop worrying about this, okay?

02:45.231 --> 02:49.429
The Peace Corps is not going to send her
someplace that's dangerous.

02:50.870 --> 02:52.804
Just won't be the same.

02:53.306 --> 02:54.705
What won't?

02:55.475 --> 02:56.772
Christmas.

03:13.693 --> 03:16.719
Did l tell you l'm doing dessert
for the art lunch tomorrow...

03:16.796 --> 03:19.959
and l need a couple things from Chip's.
Here's a spot. Right there.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.661
l need white chocolate and pistachios.

03:31.911 --> 03:35.745
-l didn't bring the umbrella.
-l need that stuff from Chip's.

03:35.915 --> 03:38.076
l didn't bring the umbrella.

03:38.384 --> 03:41.547
-Well, l still need it.
-lt's gonna have to wait.

03:43.356 --> 03:47.816
-Look, you stay in the car, and l'll get a--
-l'll go.

03:47.894 --> 03:50.055
Look, it's just sprinkling.

03:50.997 --> 03:54.228
Listen, don't forget:
Dixon's white chocolate, one-pound bar...

03:54.300 --> 03:56.461
and March Brothers pistachios.

03:56.903 --> 03:57.995
Okay.

04:16.289 --> 04:18.450
You could use an umbrella!

04:18.524 --> 04:20.856
l just need some white chocolate.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.241
What's the matter?

04:43.316 --> 04:46.080
l just talked to Blair.
She called from the plane.

04:46.152 --> 04:47.642
She called from the airplane?

04:47.720 --> 04:51.713
Do you have any idea
how much it costs to call from an airplane?

04:53.726 --> 04:57.184
-How is she?
-She's fine. She misses us.

04:58.331 --> 05:03.064
-l'm standing over there. l can't--
-What? You didn't get the white chocolate.

05:04.003 --> 05:05.766
They didn't have any.

05:05.838 --> 05:07.430
Did you talk to Rex?

05:07.507 --> 05:09.941
-Who's Rex?
-The butcher.

05:12.512 --> 05:17.449
As odd as it sounds, l didn't think of asking
the butcher where the chocolate was.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.088
-But l will.
-Thank you.

05:23.289 --> 05:27.385
l'll go talk to Rex right now.
Maybe he'll wonder why l'm all wet.

05:38.738 --> 05:40.501
You sure you don't need a--

05:44.644 --> 05:48.410
-Buddy, can l get one of those?
-Sure. Thanks.

05:58.291 --> 06:01.556
l really think you need an umbrella!

06:01.728 --> 06:05.391
No! You know why l don't want one
of your stupid umbrellas? Because l--

06:09.235 --> 06:13.729
Because l couldn't get any wetter!

06:50.777 --> 06:52.369
Morning, Luther.

06:53.813 --> 06:55.303
Hi, Mr. Krank.

06:56.048 --> 06:57.777
Morning, Mr. Krank.

07:39.225 --> 07:42.285
lt'll be so different this Christmas,
won't it, Luther?

07:42.361 --> 07:44.556
Yes, it will be so different.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.989
Nothing will be the same.

07:47.800 --> 07:51.736
For the first time in 23 years,
Blair won't be here.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.003
Might even get depressing.

07:58.010 --> 08:00.808
Lot of depression at Christmas, you know?

08:02.048 --> 08:03.572
Yeah, well....

08:04.817 --> 08:07.411
l would just love to forget about it.

08:16.395 --> 08:18.363
What are you looking at?

08:20.933 --> 08:23.493
Why are you looking at me like that?

08:27.073 --> 08:28.836
Finish your pasta.

08:29.842 --> 08:33.333
l'm finished with my pasta.
lt's you l'm not finished with.

08:33.412 --> 08:35.174
l'll be right back.

08:36.582 --> 08:38.812
-You wait right there.
-Okay.

08:52.899 --> 08:54.127
Luther?

08:57.737 --> 09:00.934
What are you doing?
lt's not even Saturday night.

09:10.016 --> 09:12.678
-l have an idea.
-Yeah?

09:12.752 --> 09:14.413
A brilliant idea.

09:20.826 --> 09:23.226
Make sure you shut the curtains.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.694
All right.

09:26.365 --> 09:28.265
Come over here. Turn around.

09:28.334 --> 09:30.529
What are you doing? Sit down.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.734
Button up and sit down.

09:33.005 --> 09:34.472
Look at this.

09:34.540 --> 09:38.601
This is a little ledger
of what we spent last year for Christmas.

09:39.045 --> 09:43.209
Look at some of this stuff.
What is this, $63 for ornament repair?

09:43.716 --> 09:46.651
You got to be kidding me. Look at the total.

09:47.320 --> 09:50.016
We spent $6,100 on Christmas last year.

09:50.723 --> 09:54.056
$6,100 on--

09:54.126 --> 09:55.753
l heard you the first time.

09:55.828 --> 09:59.491
-With precious little to show for it.
-Where is this going?

10:02.268 --> 10:03.758
The Caribbean.

10:05.705 --> 10:08.606
A 10-day luxury cruise on <i>The Jubilee.</i>

10:09.108 --> 10:11.804
The most luxurious ship in their fleet.

10:11.877 --> 10:13.435
Cayman lslands.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.574
Snorkeling. We go to Jamaica.

10:16.649 --> 10:19.709
We windsurf, whatever the heck that is.
Look at the picture here.

10:19.785 --> 10:23.881
The Bahamas. We sit in the sun.
10 days, luxury cruise, you and me.

10:24.690 --> 10:28.592
-l might have to lose a little weight.
-Heck, l'll lose it for you.

10:28.661 --> 10:30.322
What's the catch?

10:32.331 --> 10:34.424
l wouldn't call it a catch.

10:39.071 --> 10:40.766
We skip Christmas.

10:41.841 --> 10:43.536
We skip Christmas?

10:44.110 --> 10:47.671
We skip Christmas, save the money,
and spend it on us for a change.

10:47.747 --> 10:49.044
l don't know.

10:49.115 --> 10:52.812
Come on, please.
You and l go bask in the Caribbean sun.

10:54.854 --> 10:57.721
-How much is this gonna cost?
-$3,000.

11:00.026 --> 11:04.463
-We save money?
-Absolutely.

11:06.532 --> 11:09.228
We can still give our charitable donations...

11:09.301 --> 11:11.826
to Children's Hospital
and, of course, the church.

11:11.904 --> 11:15.135
No, this is a total boycott, honey. Total.

11:15.307 --> 11:16.706
lt's $600.

11:18.344 --> 11:20.107
lt's a total boycott.

11:20.179 --> 11:22.909
l'm afraid that's all l'm gonna say about that.

11:22.982 --> 11:25.473
Well, then, no.

11:26.886 --> 11:28.683
What a stupid idea.

11:30.356 --> 11:34.622
You're gonna let a lousy $600
stand between us and a Caribbean cruise.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.295
No. You are.

11:43.636 --> 11:44.762
All right, look.

11:44.837 --> 11:48.864
l'll match last year's contribution
to the church and to the hospital...

11:48.941 --> 11:50.738
but not a penny more.

11:50.943 --> 11:53.878
-When do we leave?
-High noon, Christmas day.

11:58.150 --> 12:00.414
lt's not even Saturday night.

12:05.024 --> 12:07.754
l will not be celebrating Christmas this year.

12:10.096 --> 12:12.826
As many of you know, Blair has joined...

12:13.733 --> 12:15.360
the Peace Corps.

12:19.438 --> 12:22.896
So Nora and l have decided to avoid
the rituals of Christmas...

12:22.975 --> 12:25.739
save our money, and take a cruise.

12:26.912 --> 12:31.281
<i>Therefore, I will not be participating</i>
<i>in the usual holiday rituals.</i>

12:31.751 --> 12:36.051
<i>I will buy no gifts and accept none.</i>
<i>Thank you, anyway.</i>

12:36.188 --> 12:38.952
<i>I will not attend</i>
<i>the firm's black-tie Christmas dinner...</i>

12:39.024 --> 12:41.788
<i>nor will I be here for the office party.</i>

12:42.962 --> 12:46.693
<i>I am not angry and I will not yell...</i>

12:47.733 --> 12:51.100
<i>''humbug'' at anyone who offers me</i>
<i>a holiday greeting.</i>

12:53.773 --> 12:57.436
l am simply skipping Christmas.

13:07.653 --> 13:10.144
-Hello, Mrs. Krank.
-Hello, Aubie, how are you?

13:10.222 --> 13:12.622
l'm just a little worried
about your Christmas cards.

13:12.691 --> 13:13.715
Why are you worried?

13:13.793 --> 13:17.729
You always select the most beautiful cards.
You really should put your order in.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.231
We're not gonna be ordering
Christmas cards this year.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.028
-Do what?
-You heard me.

13:22.101 --> 13:23.534
May l ask why not?

13:23.602 --> 13:27.868
You know, l'm really quite late for lunch.
Bye-bye. Say hi to your mom.

13:29.108 --> 13:31.474
But we always have
a live band at the auction.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.876
Yeah, but last year, the band cost $15,000.

13:33.946 --> 13:36.346
We hired a deejay for the Cancer Ball.

13:36.415 --> 13:37.541
Ladies.

13:37.616 --> 13:39.311
-Hi, Aubie.
-Hello.

13:39.618 --> 13:43.349
Mrs. Krank, we forgot to talk about
your Christmas invitations.

13:43.422 --> 13:45.686
We won't be needing those, either.

13:45.758 --> 13:48.488
-No party?
-No Christmas Eve party?

13:48.894 --> 13:50.885
No party this year.

13:51.297 --> 13:54.130
She's not ordering Christmas cards either.

13:57.203 --> 13:58.534
What's up?

14:02.141 --> 14:03.267
We're...

14:03.709 --> 14:05.301
taking a break.

14:06.512 --> 14:09.208
We're not gonna do Christmas this year.

14:09.515 --> 14:13.315
-How do you simply not do Christmas?
-You skip it.

14:13.719 --> 14:16.347
But then what do we do Christmas Eve?

14:16.555 --> 14:19.547
You'll think of something.
There are plenty of other parties.

14:19.625 --> 14:21.388
But none like yours.

14:21.794 --> 14:22.920
That's sweet.

14:22.995 --> 14:25.463
-When do you leave?
-Christmas day.

14:26.265 --> 14:28.290
That's an odd time to travel.

14:28.367 --> 14:32.064
Apparently, not that many people travel
on December 25th...

14:32.137 --> 14:34.230
and so Luther got us a great deal.

14:34.940 --> 14:36.771
Then why don't you have the party anyway?

14:36.842 --> 14:40.334
Because we don't want to, Merry.
We're taking a break.

14:40.913 --> 14:43.609
One year off, no Christmas whatsoever.

14:44.850 --> 14:48.183
-What do we do?
-l don't know.

15:09.275 --> 15:11.800
Mr. Krank, l'm Randy Scanlon.

15:11.877 --> 15:14.243
We're selling Christmas trees again
this year.

15:14.313 --> 15:16.178
Got yours right here.

15:17.616 --> 15:20.676
You got a Canadian blue spruce last year.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.813
This one's a real beauty. Almost 10 feet tall.

15:24.123 --> 15:26.318
Mrs. Krank likes the big ones.

15:26.392 --> 15:27.484
Aren't they cute?

15:27.559 --> 15:31.154
-How much is the big one?
-$90. We had to go up a little.

15:34.199 --> 15:37.168
We're not buying a Christmas tree this year.

15:39.338 --> 15:41.602
-Luther.
-We talked about this.

15:50.849 --> 15:53.374
Sorry we had to go up on the price.

15:53.619 --> 15:56.019
We're making less per tree than last year.

15:56.088 --> 15:59.319
lt's not about the money.
We're not doing Christmas this year.

15:59.391 --> 16:01.689
We're gonna go away on a cruise.

16:02.661 --> 16:04.458
We don't need a tree.

16:11.537 --> 16:14.700
All right. Well, out of the frying pan...

16:15.808 --> 16:17.435
and into the fire.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.039
Luther.

16:20.112 --> 16:21.943
-What?
-Come here.

16:22.081 --> 16:24.276
-Why?
-Come here.

16:26.418 --> 16:28.477
-What are they doing?
-Who?

16:29.888 --> 16:34.257
-Spilling their guts to Frohmeyer.
-Not Frohmeyer.

16:36.895 --> 16:39.329
Are you intimidated by Vic Frohmeyer?

16:39.398 --> 16:42.231
Honey, he's like the unelected ward boss
of the street.

16:42.301 --> 16:45.202
So Frohmeyer has a problem
with our skipping Christmas?

16:45.270 --> 16:46.760
Who's he gonna call?

16:46.839 --> 16:49.467
The Three Wise Men? Santa Claus?

16:50.909 --> 16:53.139
Don't underestimate him, honey.

16:53.212 --> 16:56.875
Vic Frohmeyer lives and breathes
for this neighborhood.

16:57.116 --> 16:59.277
-You should've just bought the tree.
-No.

16:59.351 --> 17:01.046
-You didn't have to put it up.
-No.

17:01.120 --> 17:04.055
-You could've left it in the backyard.
-Quiet.

17:04.123 --> 17:06.717
Why are you whispering? This is our house.

17:06.791 --> 17:10.751
l'm whispering for the same reason
you're hiding behind that curtain.

17:13.965 --> 17:15.297
Hey, Walt.

17:15.367 --> 17:18.928
Luther Krank just stiffed the Scouts
on a Christmas tree.

17:23.575 --> 17:26.135
Can you believe that, Mr. Frohmeyer?

17:53.205 --> 17:56.436
Do not put it up there.
l want them on the back of the house.

17:56.708 --> 18:00.508
Move it to the right. The other right.

18:01.046 --> 18:03.571
-Becker's at it again.
-Evening, Vic.

18:04.016 --> 18:06.814
Everybody's going to really miss Blair
this year.

18:06.885 --> 18:09.285
The whole block's talking about it.
How is she doing?

18:09.354 --> 18:12.187
She's doing just fine. Thanks for asking.

18:12.658 --> 18:13.750
How's your family?

18:13.826 --> 18:17.159
ln great spirits.
We're putting up decorations tonight.

18:17.229 --> 18:18.560
Wind it tight, Spike!

18:20.365 --> 18:23.596
-Hi, Dad!
-Looks good, Mama!

18:25.237 --> 18:28.229
lt's the greatest time of year,
don't you think?

18:28.307 --> 18:30.241
l couldn't be happier.

18:31.143 --> 18:33.270
lt's not gonna be the same
without Blair here.

18:33.345 --> 18:34.903
Of course not.

18:40.352 --> 18:42.115
Honey, are you okay?

18:42.688 --> 18:46.215
-Come here. Honey!
-Give me a hand.

18:47.326 --> 18:51.626
There are certain things around here
that l'm gonna miss at Christmas.

18:51.930 --> 18:53.261
So you're...

18:53.665 --> 18:55.360
really skipping out?

18:55.467 --> 18:56.934
You got it.

18:57.703 --> 19:00.194
Somehow, it just doesn't seem right.

19:00.272 --> 19:02.638
That's really not up to you to decide, is it?

19:02.708 --> 19:05.370
But l got to tell you,
the neighbors are pretty upset.

19:05.444 --> 19:06.468
Really?

19:06.545 --> 19:10.037
Christmas has always been a neighborhood
thing around here. You know that.

19:10.115 --> 19:14.245
Everybody decorates.
Everybody bakes cookies, and swaps gifts.

19:15.954 --> 19:17.683
l guess we do it for the kids.

19:17.756 --> 19:20.224
lf you're trying to make me feel guilty,
get off of it.

19:20.292 --> 19:22.624
And you know what else?
l'd appreciate it if you...

19:22.694 --> 19:25.629
and everyone else around here
would just respect my wishes.

19:25.731 --> 19:27.722
Whatever you say, Luther.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.676
Weather should be clear tomorrow.

19:42.214 --> 19:44.444
Perfect time to put up Frosty.

19:45.884 --> 19:47.112
Frosty?

19:52.024 --> 19:55.050
Tell you what, truth is, if l'm gone, l'm....

19:58.964 --> 20:00.022
Vic?

20:07.706 --> 20:10.266
Frosty is a Christmas tradition.

20:10.776 --> 20:13.006
Frosty is a Christmas decoration.

20:13.078 --> 20:17.071
l will not be told by Vic Frohmeyer that
l have to decorate my house for Christmas.

20:18.784 --> 20:20.945
Why won't you put up Frosty?

20:22.321 --> 20:25.085
lt's the principle thing. Do you understand?

20:25.157 --> 20:28.285
We can forget about Christmas
if we damn well choose.

20:28.360 --> 20:31.454
And nobody,
not even Vic Frohmeyer, can stop us.

20:31.697 --> 20:34.291
l will not be forced into doing this.

20:42.874 --> 20:44.637
Have a good day.

20:47.145 --> 20:48.442
Hi, Nora.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.644
-Morning, Bev. Hi, Walt.
-Hey, Nora!

20:59.858 --> 21:01.621
lt was an accident.

21:02.427 --> 21:05.021
Walt, why don't you put
that cat of yours on a leash?

21:05.097 --> 21:07.497
Only dogs wear leashes, old man.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.762
Think you can run away from Christmas?

21:12.104 --> 21:15.505
-l'm trying to.
-Guess it's a good way to save money.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.971
-lt's not about the money.
-Yeah, sure.

21:19.344 --> 21:23.303
Muffles, be polite.
Will you two ever be friends?

21:24.549 --> 21:26.881
You know, l'd like to say yes, but....

21:32.024 --> 21:33.616
How you feeling today, Bev?

21:33.692 --> 21:37.059
Have my good days and bad days.
Today's a good day.

21:37.362 --> 21:39.262
l'm glad to hear that.

21:39.765 --> 21:42.097
Come have your breakfast, dear.

21:42.934 --> 21:44.424
l got to get to work.

21:44.503 --> 21:46.835
Still working for the Man, huh?

21:47.439 --> 21:49.407
As a matter of fact, it is a man l work for.

21:49.474 --> 21:52.534
Thought they would've made you partner
by now.

21:54.279 --> 21:56.076
l got to get to work.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.374
Have a good one, old man.

22:03.422 --> 22:06.448
One snowball with a little yellow spot on it.

22:06.825 --> 22:10.693
Just skim the top of that little head of his.
Just like that.

22:10.829 --> 22:12.160
''Old man.''

22:16.535 --> 22:17.934
Bah, humbug.

22:19.471 --> 22:21.530
Good morning, Mr. Scrooge.

22:25.277 --> 22:28.075
-Morning, Dox. Do l have any messages?
-Wal-Mart called.

22:28.146 --> 22:32.515
Said l had to buy my own cheap perfume
since Santa Claus isn't coming this year.

22:33.885 --> 22:35.113
Funny.

22:36.788 --> 22:38.187
Nora Krank!

22:38.857 --> 22:40.757
We're here for Frosty!

22:49.234 --> 22:50.496
<i>-Hello.</i>
-Luther.

22:50.569 --> 22:52.764
-Hey, babe.
-They're here.

22:52.838 --> 22:53.862
<i>Who?</i>

22:53.939 --> 22:57.932
Vic Frohmeyer, Wes Trogdon, Ned Becker,
and a gang of their kids.

22:58.009 --> 22:59.874
We're here for Frosty!

23:00.245 --> 23:02.805
-They want Frosty.
-They can't have him.

23:02.881 --> 23:04.007
Nora!

23:04.383 --> 23:06.510
Please give us Frosty.

23:09.154 --> 23:11.281
Honey, where is Frosty?

23:11.356 --> 23:14.450
-He's down behind the furnace. Why?
-They won't go away.

23:14.526 --> 23:16.118
<i>Don't give them Frosty.</i>

23:16.194 --> 23:19.027
You and Luther do not have to do anything!

23:19.398 --> 23:23.732
Just leave Frosty on the front porch.
We'll put him up for you.

23:24.102 --> 23:27.162
-They said they'll put him up for us.
-Absolutely not.

23:27.239 --> 23:29.434
-Please, Luther.
-No!

23:30.475 --> 23:32.306
We'll come back later.

23:33.211 --> 23:35.042
And Frosty better be here.

23:35.113 --> 23:37.047
They're gonna come back!

23:37.115 --> 23:38.207
<i>Listen to you.</i>

23:38.283 --> 23:40.547
You're panicking on the phone
in a locked house...

23:40.619 --> 23:42.746
because the neighbors
are going door to door...

23:42.821 --> 23:47.485
to set up a ridiculous
7-foot tall snowman!

23:48.560 --> 23:52.826
Sure, easy for you to say.
Miles away in the safety of your office.

23:52.898 --> 23:53.990
Yeah, well--

23:54.065 --> 23:57.159
l am the one trapped here.
l am the one dealing with this!

23:57.235 --> 24:00.762
All right, l agree. So maybe it's time
that you left the neighborhood.

24:00.839 --> 24:03.865
Sure, honey.
How do you think l'm gonna do that?

24:03.942 --> 24:06.877
The street is blocked
with all of our neighbors.

24:06.945 --> 24:10.210
Walk to the garage, get in the car,
start it, drive to the mall...

24:10.282 --> 24:11.749
l'll meet you at O'Leary's.

24:11.817 --> 24:15.150
<i>Do it now! You can do this! Do it before--</i>

24:30.735 --> 24:32.532
Bit more to the left.

24:34.439 --> 24:36.100
That looks good.

24:45.684 --> 24:48.278
-Hi, Mrs. Krank.
-Nora?

24:52.023 --> 24:53.786
Vic, she's leaving!

24:56.595 --> 24:58.290
What's she doing?

24:58.363 --> 25:00.957
l'm so sorry.

25:04.202 --> 25:05.430
Sorry!

25:08.206 --> 25:09.969
Nora, stop the car.

25:10.041 --> 25:13.977
Stop the car. Please, listen.
Don't do anything you'll regret.

25:14.112 --> 25:16.740
Now, please, indulge me for a second.

25:17.115 --> 25:20.812
Stop the car. Listen to me. Give us Frosty.

25:20.886 --> 25:22.353
Stop the car.

25:25.724 --> 25:27.624
We just want Frosty.

25:28.393 --> 25:31.590
Talk to me. Please. lndulge me for a second.

25:50.282 --> 25:53.445
lt's us women who handle Christmas,
not men.

25:53.518 --> 25:56.954
l am the one taking the brunt
for your harebrained scheme.

25:57.022 --> 25:59.354
l am the one on the frontlines.

26:01.927 --> 26:03.792
-l have a surprise for you.
-What?

26:03.862 --> 26:05.056
Shut your eyes.

26:10.468 --> 26:12.333
All right, open them.

26:15.640 --> 26:19.974
-Honey, is this some kind of joke?
-No, l got one, too. What do you think?

26:20.045 --> 26:22.013
A woman's bathing suit?

26:22.814 --> 26:25.783
Probably belongs with that.
Nope, got my own.

26:26.785 --> 26:30.118
Look at that. Little cliff-diver thing.

26:30.622 --> 26:34.581
Honey, there is no way
we are wearing these on this cruise.

26:35.660 --> 26:37.787
These aren't for the cruise.

26:40.932 --> 26:42.729
You know what's odd?

26:42.867 --> 26:46.894
ls when an lrish pub serves fish tacos.
l don't get that.

26:47.038 --> 26:51.498
l got a little heartburn. l don't think l'm
gonna do that again. Here it is, right here.

26:51.910 --> 26:54.811
Come on.
Follow me, and don't mention her eyes.

26:54.980 --> 26:56.572
Hello, Mr. Krank.

26:56.648 --> 27:00.209
-Hi, Daisy. This is my wife, Nora.
-Hello.

27:02.687 --> 27:04.382
l really don't want to do this.

27:04.456 --> 27:08.119
No, come on. l got a great deal.
$60, 1 2 visits.

27:09.027 --> 27:11.291
Why would we get a tan before the cruise?

27:11.363 --> 27:14.298
l thought the whole point was to get a tan
during the cruise.

27:14.366 --> 27:17.961
Look at our skin.
We kind of look like uncooked chicken.

27:18.536 --> 27:20.470
You look like a corpse.

27:21.306 --> 27:24.104
And you could use a little help yourself.

27:24.509 --> 27:25.874
Thank you.

27:29.114 --> 27:32.106
Dear God, this should be outlawed.

27:45.130 --> 27:46.757
Okay, calm down.

27:58.343 --> 27:59.674
Excuse me.

28:07.852 --> 28:11.344
Excuse me. Hello!

28:11.690 --> 28:13.487
l need a BAND-AlD.

28:14.092 --> 28:15.719
Nora Krank?

28:19.197 --> 28:23.099
Father Zabriskie. Hello.
What are you doing here?

28:23.268 --> 28:26.066
lt's a mall. l'm Christmas shopping.

28:26.971 --> 28:29.804
Of course you are.

28:30.041 --> 28:31.474
Are you okay?

28:31.643 --> 28:33.736
Yes. Sort of.

28:33.912 --> 28:35.436
You're bleeding.

28:35.513 --> 28:39.472
Yes, it's just a scratch.
Could l get another towel, please?

28:39.684 --> 28:43.586
l'm looking for a BAND-AlD.
Jeez, lady, make up your mind.

28:49.627 --> 28:53.620
Nora, l hear it from a good source
that you and Luther...

28:54.265 --> 28:57.393
have decided not to observe Christmas
this year.

29:00.438 --> 29:01.928
Yeah, sort of.

29:02.640 --> 29:05.700
Father Zabriskie, Luther and l are fine.

29:06.377 --> 29:09.938
Everything is fine,
and everything is completely normal.

29:10.148 --> 29:12.548
Attendant said you were bleeding.
Are you all right?

29:12.617 --> 29:14.585
-Luther.
-Hey, there.

29:16.454 --> 29:18.149
Father Zabriskie.

29:19.424 --> 29:20.550
Hey.

29:24.262 --> 29:25.957
We've made the front page.

29:28.733 --> 29:30.701
-Check it out.
-Hold on.

29:34.739 --> 29:36.900
-''Skipping Christmas.''
-Yep.

29:36.975 --> 29:40.240
''The home of Mr. and Mrs. Luther Krank
is rather dark this Christmas.

29:40.311 --> 29:44.179
''While their neighbors on Hemlock Street
are decorating and preparing for Santa...

29:44.249 --> 29:46.774
''the Kranks are skipping Christmas.

29:46.851 --> 29:50.651
''They're preparing for a cruise,
according to unnamed sources.

29:51.189 --> 29:53.487
''No tree, no lights,
and no Frosty up on the roof...

29:53.558 --> 29:56.618
''and the only house on Hemlock
to keep Frosty in the basement.''

29:56.694 --> 30:00.323
-How do they know where Frosty is?
-They have spies everywhere.

30:00.398 --> 30:04.095
''Hemlock, a frequent winner
in <i>The Gazette</i> Street Decoration Contest...

30:04.169 --> 30:06.160
''finished a disappointing sixth this year.

30:06.237 --> 30:10.196
'''l hope they're satisfied now,'
complained one unidentified neighbor.

30:10.275 --> 30:13.870
'''A rotten display of selfishness,'
said another.''

30:13.945 --> 30:16.345
-Who said that?
-Could've been anybody.

30:16.414 --> 30:18.109
How dare they!

30:18.750 --> 30:21.150
What a bunch of losers.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.353
You know what?

30:23.421 --> 30:27.221
You know, l don't think l'm coming back
from this cruise.

30:27.992 --> 30:30.256
Attagirl. Two more days
and we're out of here.

30:30.328 --> 30:31.886
Two more, baby.

30:33.164 --> 30:34.222
Jerks.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.365
-Chocolate milk?
-Sure.

30:37.969 --> 30:39.436
That's mine.

30:41.873 --> 30:44.637
-Regular.
-Sorry l'm late.

30:44.709 --> 30:46.472
Hey. What's wrong?

30:46.744 --> 30:48.541
lt's Bev Scheel.

30:50.582 --> 30:52.607
-Could you cover for me?
-Sure.

30:52.984 --> 30:55.953
-What happened?
-She went for a checkup yesterday.

30:56.020 --> 30:58.511
The cancer's back for the third time.

30:58.590 --> 31:00.922
-Has it spread?
-They think so.

31:00.992 --> 31:02.357
That's awful.

31:03.061 --> 31:05.393
This could be her last Christmas.

31:05.563 --> 31:06.894
Sweetheart.

31:22.447 --> 31:25.473
Well, if it isn't old Scrooge himself.

31:26.951 --> 31:29.613
How do you think this photographer
got this shot?

31:29.687 --> 31:32.485
-What photographer?
-The one that took this photograph.

31:32.557 --> 31:34.650
-That one.
-Yeah, that one.

31:34.993 --> 31:36.483
He climbed up.

31:36.794 --> 31:38.785
-On your roof?
-Yeah.

31:39.931 --> 31:42.923
-Why did you do that?
-l don't know.

31:43.301 --> 31:46.634
He said he wanted to get a shot
of the whole street.

31:49.374 --> 31:51.342
At least you're consistent.

31:51.409 --> 31:53.036
l try to be, old man.

31:53.111 --> 31:54.738
-Stop that.
-Stop what?

31:54.812 --> 31:56.871
Stop calling me ''old man.''

31:57.548 --> 31:59.209
You're, like, 10 years older than me.

31:59.284 --> 32:00.512
-Am l?
-Yeah.

32:00.585 --> 32:02.348
-Prove it.
-Walt.

32:04.722 --> 32:08.180
l just heard about Bev. l am so sorry.

32:10.962 --> 32:12.589
How's she doing?

32:12.664 --> 32:16.998
Remarkably well. ln good spirits.
Decorating the house, baking cookies.

32:17.068 --> 32:20.367
Sure. lf there's anything we can do,
let me know.

32:20.872 --> 32:23.306
Thanks. l really appreciate that.

33:04.182 --> 33:06.173
They're here for Frosty.

33:09.187 --> 33:10.245
No.

33:16.060 --> 33:18.028
-l'll get it.
-Thank you.

33:23.468 --> 33:26.699
-Good evening, Mr. Krank.
-Good evening, officers.

33:26.804 --> 33:29.238
lt's that time of year again.

33:29.440 --> 33:33.308
Your Police Benevolent Association's
out there raising money for the community.

33:33.378 --> 33:34.709
That's great.

33:34.779 --> 33:38.476
You know, Toys for Tots, and we deliver
gift baskets for the underprivileged.

33:38.549 --> 33:40.676
And ice skating for handicapped kids.

33:40.752 --> 33:44.313
Every year, we deliver presents
for the elderly at the nursing homes...

33:44.389 --> 33:46.584
and, of course, our war veterans.

33:46.657 --> 33:49.319
Our big moneymaker is our calendar...

33:49.394 --> 33:52.420
and you buy one every year, so here we are.

33:56.534 --> 33:58.593
We don't need a calendar this year.

34:04.108 --> 34:05.575
What a jerk.

34:06.244 --> 34:08.405
He said he didn't need one.

34:09.347 --> 34:12.942
Thank you for your contribution.
Merry Christmas.

34:13.384 --> 34:16.181
Yeah, Merry Christmas. Good luck with it.

34:22.726 --> 34:25.753
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

34:25.830 --> 34:30.391
We're from St. Maria's Lutheran Church
out caroling. Are those folks home?

34:31.202 --> 34:32.998
Yes, they are.

34:33.404 --> 34:35.702
-Are they Jewish?
-No.

34:36.306 --> 34:39.242
-Buddhist or anything?
-No, none of that.

34:39.476 --> 34:42.708
They're just trying
to avoid Christmas this year.

34:42.947 --> 34:46.610
-Do what?
-You heard me. He's kind of weird.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.887
Skipping Christmas so he can
save his money for a cruise.

34:49.954 --> 34:51.080
No.

34:51.155 --> 34:54.647
l think some Christmas cheer
would do them good.

34:54.725 --> 34:56.386
-Really?
-Why don't you go ahead?

34:56.460 --> 34:57.985
All righty then.

35:03.534 --> 35:04.728
Drop.

35:07.004 --> 35:08.096
Down!

35:28.559 --> 35:29.685
Go!

35:35.299 --> 35:36.732
This is fun.

35:40.571 --> 35:43.699
Christmas carolers
right out next to our junipers.

35:44.675 --> 35:45.903
How lovely.

35:45.977 --> 35:48.844
lt's not lovely. They're trespassing.
Somebody set us up.

35:48.913 --> 35:51.848
-They're not trespassing.
-Yes, they are.

35:51.916 --> 35:54.407
They're on our property.
They weren't invited.

35:54.485 --> 35:57.682
Somebody told them to come.
Scheel or Frohmeyer.

35:58.389 --> 36:02.883
-Christmas carolers are not trespassers.
-l know what l'm talking about here.

36:02.960 --> 36:06.259
-Why don't you have them arrested, then?
-l just may do that.

36:06.731 --> 36:09.564
Call your friends
down at the police department.

36:09.634 --> 36:13.434
-That's funny.
-Not too late to buy a calendar.

36:15.006 --> 36:17.236
This isn't a joke. This is military.

36:17.308 --> 36:20.209
This is SEAL stuff.
l saw it on Discovery Channel.

37:44.362 --> 37:45.624
Come on.

37:54.305 --> 37:57.797
Just sit right here. Here you go. Right here.

37:57.875 --> 38:00.435
There. That's perfect.

38:01.045 --> 38:04.776
Quietest room in the house.
No one can find us down here.

38:15.693 --> 38:18.389
Free Frosty! Free Frosty!

38:32.009 --> 38:34.170
Merry Christmas, Mrs. Krank.

39:14.885 --> 39:16.375
Luther!

39:21.525 --> 39:24.983
''Every Who down in Who-ville
liked Christmas a lot.

39:25.363 --> 39:29.527
''But the Grinch who lived
just north of Who-ville did not.

39:30.167 --> 39:33.933
''The Grinch hated Christmas,
the whole Christmas season.

39:34.004 --> 39:37.667
''Now, please don't ask why,
no one quite knows the reason.

39:37.742 --> 39:41.143
''lt could be his head
wasn't screwed on just right.

39:41.345 --> 39:44.781
''lt could be, perhaps,
that his shoes were too tight.

39:47.351 --> 39:49.819
''But l think
that the most likely reason of all...

39:49.887 --> 39:54.051
''may have been that his heart
was two sizes too small.''

39:57.561 --> 39:59.188
<i>Luther, your face.</i>

39:59.497 --> 40:02.898
-What about it?
-lt's like it's frozen or something.

40:03.200 --> 40:04.360
This?

40:05.636 --> 40:08.002
l got a BOTOX injection today.

40:08.639 --> 40:09.901
BOTOX treatment.

40:09.974 --> 40:13.569
They take a big needle
and they inject it into your forehead.

40:13.644 --> 40:16.909
lt freezes your face like this.
l read it in a health magazine.

40:16.981 --> 40:20.542
-How long are you gonna be like this?
-This is temporary.

40:20.885 --> 40:23.854
And then you got all your wrinkles are gone.

40:28.859 --> 40:32.386
-You should try this.
-You ought to get your money back.

40:34.799 --> 40:38.257
-l can't live like this anymore.
-What?

40:40.037 --> 40:41.561
We can't go out.

40:41.639 --> 40:44.938
Everywhere we go,
people are whispering behind our backs.

40:45.009 --> 40:48.069
l can't go home. lt's too depressing.

40:48.846 --> 40:52.646
l mean, there's no tree and no lights
and no music.

40:56.253 --> 40:58.050
l can't talk to you.

40:58.522 --> 41:02.219
-You're just consumed with yourself.
-That's not true.

41:02.393 --> 41:04.657
-Look how far you've gone.
-Amazing.

41:04.728 --> 41:07.856
-Turning our lawn into an ice rink.
-l can't feel anything.

41:07.932 --> 41:10.765
Somebody could've broken
their leg or their neck.

41:10.835 --> 41:14.464
-You could've put a caroler in the hospital.
-And that would be a bad thing?

41:15.039 --> 41:18.008
l'm kidding.
l know this has been tough on you.

41:18.075 --> 41:21.511
But in just one day, 24 hours,
we'll be on that trip.

41:21.779 --> 41:24.077
And it's all gonna be better. l promise.

41:25.015 --> 41:26.141
l don't know.

41:38.395 --> 41:42.263
Do you think that Blair
will even think about Christmas?

41:42.800 --> 41:45.792
Probably not.
l mean, she's in the rainforest...

41:45.870 --> 41:48.498
and around people who worship trees...

41:48.572 --> 41:51.632
and eat bark and frogs and that sort of stuff.

41:52.343 --> 41:54.834
-You gonna wear that?
-Absolutely.

41:55.012 --> 41:56.172
Nice.

41:59.683 --> 42:00.707
<i>Free Frosty!</i>

42:00.784 --> 42:03.048
l know this is you, Spike. Goodbye.

42:03.120 --> 42:06.954
-Again? How many times is that?
-About five or six times.

42:07.691 --> 42:10.455
Wish l had a snappy comeback
for that smart guy.

42:10.528 --> 42:12.689
-Who cares?
-You're right.

42:13.564 --> 42:15.691
The islands are calling.

42:19.904 --> 42:21.769
<i>-Free Frosty! Free--</i>
-Goodbye, Spike.

42:23.340 --> 42:25.433
-You're a genius.
-Thank you.

42:33.918 --> 42:37.217
-All right, Frosty's dead.
-What? Dad, is that you?

42:37.388 --> 42:39.413
-Wait a minute. Blair?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

42:39.490 --> 42:44.325
Hi. No, that was a joke.
l thought that was somebody from work.

42:44.395 --> 42:48.126
Your mom's getting on the other line,
then we have something fun to tell you.

42:48.198 --> 42:49.665
-Blair.
-Hi, Mommy.

42:52.102 --> 42:54.798
Hi, honey. lt's Mommy.
How are you? Where are you?

42:54.872 --> 42:57.306
l'm in Miami,
and l'm coming home for Christmas.

42:57.374 --> 42:59.274
-What?
-Are you guys surprised?

42:59.343 --> 43:01.573
-l'm stunned.
-Surprised.

43:01.979 --> 43:05.107
-We landed about an hour ago.
-That's great!

43:05.182 --> 43:08.379
-What do you mean ''we''?
-l have another wonderful surprise.

43:08.452 --> 43:11.012
-Yeah? What is it?
-l'm with Enrique.

43:12.656 --> 43:14.851
-What's a rique?
<i>-Enrique.</i>

43:14.992 --> 43:17.426
<i>He's a doctor. We went to Brown together.</i>

43:17.494 --> 43:20.793
<i>You guys met him a couple of times.</i>
<i>At my dorms and at my graduation.</i>

43:20.864 --> 43:22.456
-Of course.
-l don't remember.

43:22.533 --> 43:23.830
He's Peruvian.

43:23.901 --> 43:26.199
-Great. A Communist.
-Honey!

43:26.637 --> 43:29.128
-Sometimes we called him Rick.
-Rick?

43:29.206 --> 43:31.766
The guy that you went down there
to shack up with.

43:31.842 --> 43:33.673
He lived in a separate hut, Dad.

43:33.777 --> 43:36.678
Hut schmut. l want to see pictures
to prove that.

43:36.747 --> 43:40.046
We've been friends for years.
And he's just so wonderful.

43:40.117 --> 43:42.745
<i>We fell in love while working together...</i>

43:42.820 --> 43:44.845
and he's asked me to marry him.

43:44.922 --> 43:46.219
What?

43:46.290 --> 43:48.190
And l really want to.

43:50.260 --> 43:51.557
Honey!

43:52.229 --> 43:54.857
Enrique has always gone home
for the holidays, so he's...

43:54.932 --> 43:57.924
<i>never celebrated Christmas</i>
<i>in America. And he's so excited.</i>

43:58.002 --> 44:01.096
l told him all about Christmas there.
The tree, the decorations...

44:01.171 --> 44:04.902
<i>Frosty up on the roof. Everything.</i>
<i>Is it snowing, Daddy?</i>

44:04.975 --> 44:07.273
You know,
Enrique has never seen a white Christmas.

44:07.344 --> 44:09.608
No, but l sense a storm coming.

44:09.680 --> 44:12.615
Okay, when do you land?
When do you get in?

44:12.683 --> 44:15.151
-We land at 8:03.
-Tonight?

44:15.219 --> 44:18.916
Yes, tonight. Just in time
for our big Christmas Eve party.

44:19.623 --> 44:22.183
You are having the party, aren't you, Mom?

44:23.327 --> 44:24.851
Of course we are.

44:24.928 --> 44:29.024
<i>Great! Mom, you are going to love Enrique.</i>

44:29.366 --> 44:31.300
He wants to have a houseful of kids.

44:31.669 --> 44:33.000
Honey!

44:33.070 --> 44:36.528
Oh, Mom, l can't wait to be home.
Pretty neat surprise?

44:36.974 --> 44:39.238
l am speechless!

44:39.309 --> 44:42.938
And your father is probably overwhelmed.

44:43.013 --> 44:44.605
<i>Great. I love you, Mommy.</i>

44:44.682 --> 44:48.413
l love you too, honey. Safe flight.
Okay, l'll see you here.

44:53.691 --> 44:56.353
-She should've called sooner.
-But she didn't.

44:56.427 --> 44:58.759
Why did you tell her
we're having that party?

44:58.829 --> 45:00.296
Because we are.

45:00.364 --> 45:01.888
l need my vest.

45:04.301 --> 45:07.634
l don't know who's coming to the party
or what they're gonna eat...

45:07.705 --> 45:09.104
but we're having a party.

45:09.173 --> 45:10.367
What about our trip?

45:10.441 --> 45:13.968
Don't even start with me.
This was all your stupid idea.

45:16.980 --> 45:19.778
Stupid idea?
Five minutes ago, l was a genius.

45:19.850 --> 45:23.115
-Now you're an idiot.
-How does one call change so much?

45:23.187 --> 45:26.623
Don't dwell on the past, lsland Boy,
we're having a party.

45:26.690 --> 45:29.955
Cheese, wine and Blairey's favorite:
hickory honey ham.

45:30.027 --> 45:32.791
-Who's coming to this party?
-l haven't gotten that far yet.

45:32.863 --> 45:35.058
-You're in charge of the tree.
-We don't have one.

45:35.132 --> 45:36.565
Get one and put it up.

45:36.633 --> 45:40.467
Then you will get your little brown butt
down to the basement and put up Frosty.

45:40.537 --> 45:41.629
-No!
-Yes!

45:41.705 --> 45:44.265
We are going to perform
a little Christmas miracle.

45:44.341 --> 45:47.003
lf we pull it off,
Blairey is never gonna know...

45:47.077 --> 45:50.535
about your stupid, ridiculous,
childish scheme...

45:50.614 --> 45:52.514
of skipping Christmas.

46:10.267 --> 46:12.861
l'm sorry about this little ugly bush.

46:12.936 --> 46:14.961
-Merry Christmas.
-lt is, isn't it?

46:15.038 --> 46:16.027
-Duke Scanlon.
-Hi, Duke.

46:16.106 --> 46:17.471
The same guy who brought you...

46:17.541 --> 46:19.975
that beautiful Canadian blue spruce
a few weeks back.

46:20.043 --> 46:24.412
Okay, great! Merry Christmas to you.
l need another blue spruce just like that.

46:24.481 --> 46:27.882
l really need a tree right now.
What do you got left?

46:31.021 --> 46:32.386
Just one.

46:33.690 --> 46:36.853
You know what? l like it. l'll take that one.

46:38.228 --> 46:40.526
-Really?
-Yeah. How much is it?

46:41.465 --> 46:43.956
-$75.
-lt says $15 right there.

46:44.234 --> 46:47.829
-Yeah. Supply and demand.
-That's kind of a rip-off, isn't it?

46:47.905 --> 46:52.399
The Scouts could sure use
your $75 donation for their camporee.

46:52.843 --> 46:55.334
What do you guys say l give you $25?

46:56.013 --> 46:58.743
$75. Take it or leave it.

46:59.917 --> 47:01.179
Yours?

47:36.453 --> 47:38.944
-Hey, Wes.
-Hey, Luther. Merry Christmas.

47:39.022 --> 47:42.423
Merry Christmas to you, too, man.
l'm in a little bit of a bind.

47:42.492 --> 47:45.757
l got to be at my in-laws' by 5:00.
l should've left two hours ago.

47:45.829 --> 47:48.992
Let me give you a hand.
This won't take long.

47:49.166 --> 47:51.532
Listen to me. My plans have changed.

47:51.602 --> 47:54.867
l got a call from Blair.
She's coming home tonight.

48:00.677 --> 48:02.645
-What about the cruise?
-l don't know.

48:02.713 --> 48:05.648
-l can't find a Christmas tree, though.
-So?

48:08.585 --> 48:09.813
Can l borrow yours?

48:09.887 --> 48:13.050
-Wes, we got to go.
-Be right there, T.

48:13.123 --> 48:14.420
-You want my tree?
-Yeah.

48:14.491 --> 48:17.016
l can get it back in your house
before you return.

48:17.761 --> 48:20.229
-That's ridiculous.
-But l don't have a choice.

48:20.297 --> 48:23.494
Everyone else needs their tree
tonight and tomorrow.

48:23.867 --> 48:26.802
-You're serious, aren't you?
-Dead serious.

48:27.271 --> 48:29.762
-Trish wouldn't like it.
-Trish doesn't have to know.

48:29.840 --> 48:31.774
-Hey, Trish!
-Hi, Luther.

48:32.276 --> 48:35.837
-Honey, we got to go.
-He's just saying Merry Christmas.

48:38.949 --> 48:40.143
Please.

48:44.888 --> 48:47.254
You break one ornament, we're both dead.

48:47.324 --> 48:51.590
l will leave it just like l found it.
l appreciate this, l really do.

48:51.662 --> 48:54.392
-This is funny, you know?
-Why am l not laughing?

48:54.464 --> 48:56.455
Free Frosty! Free Frosty!

48:56.533 --> 48:58.398
-Got to go.
-Thanks.

49:02.272 --> 49:04.672
Guys! Fellas.

49:05.642 --> 49:07.473
Guys, l'm sitting right over here.

49:07.544 --> 49:09.603
-Scatter!
-Go!

49:09.780 --> 49:11.407
-Wait.
-Run!

49:11.581 --> 49:13.105
Wait, come here.

49:14.685 --> 49:17.153
l just want to talk to you, Spike.

49:22.392 --> 49:23.882
-Let me go!
-Bad little elf.

49:23.994 --> 49:26.360
-Stop squirming around.
-Get off!

49:26.563 --> 49:28.121
-Come on.
-Don't hit me.

49:28.198 --> 49:30.962
lt was a joke.
The Frosty sign, the phone calls.

49:31.034 --> 49:33.764
l know. l'm not gonna hurt you,
l'm not gonna hit you.

49:33.837 --> 49:36.203
But you do owe me.

49:36.573 --> 49:39.770
-All l got is $20.
-l don't want your money.

49:41.812 --> 49:43.541
l need a little help.

50:02.566 --> 50:06.434
That is one huge tree.
lt reminds me of this tree my dad got once--

50:06.503 --> 50:10.132
That's interesting. Here's the plan.
Put the real delicate ones on the sofa.

50:10.207 --> 50:14.371
-ls this against the law?
-Of course not. Just don't break anything.

50:30.827 --> 50:31.885
Spike!

50:31.962 --> 50:34.556
-Nothing valuable.
-What's it say on there?

50:35.699 --> 50:37.724
''Baby's first Christmas.''

50:38.969 --> 50:40.027
Perfect!

50:43.740 --> 50:45.833
-Hello?
-Hey, Walt. Ned here.

50:46.009 --> 50:49.103
-Merry Christmas, Ned.
<i>-Merry Christmas, Walt.</i>

50:49.179 --> 50:51.807
Say, l'm watching the Trogdons' house.

50:52.549 --> 50:55.484
lt appears as if Krank has lost his mind.

50:55.585 --> 50:58.281
-How's that?
-He's stealing their Christmas tree.

51:02.025 --> 51:06.587
Hello. Excuse me, l am looking for a ham.
A hickory honey ham.

51:06.663 --> 51:09.393
lf there are any left, they'll be back there.

51:09.466 --> 51:12.367
Thank you very much. Merry Christmas.
Excuse me.

51:46.403 --> 51:47.927
Happy holidays.

51:51.575 --> 51:55.568
-Are you sure this isn't illegal?
-Are you a cop? Come on.

52:06.523 --> 52:08.388
-Can l buy your ham?
-Pardon?

52:08.458 --> 52:10.449
Your ham, it's the last one.

52:10.527 --> 52:14.293
And my daughter, Blair, is coming home
all the way from Peru...

52:14.364 --> 52:17.333
and hickory honey hams
are her absolute favorite.

52:17.400 --> 52:21.200
-And l'd like to buy it from you.
-No, it's not for sale.

52:21.438 --> 52:25.465
But she's in the Peace Corps.

52:25.542 --> 52:29.979
And l'd be willing to pay anything
above sticker price.

52:31.148 --> 52:33.173
No, we're not interested.

52:34.251 --> 52:38.085
You know, it's never too early
to start thinking about putting away...

52:38.155 --> 52:41.591
a little something
for your child's college education.

52:44.895 --> 52:46.294
You got it?

52:53.570 --> 52:57.165
Come around here.
l want you to steer, l'll hold the back.

52:57.240 --> 52:59.265
Ready? Come around the back.

53:01.945 --> 53:03.003
Spike!

53:19.362 --> 53:21.728
-Hello, Mr. Krank.
-Hey, fellas.

53:24.201 --> 53:26.328
Where you going with that tree?

53:26.403 --> 53:29.395
Spike and l are just taking it to my house.

53:29.472 --> 53:30.700
Spike?

53:31.074 --> 53:33.133
Yeah, the kid. Spike.

53:38.114 --> 53:41.550
Did he just run that way? No? That's weird.

53:43.186 --> 53:46.155
-ls this an imaginary friend?
-No.

53:53.363 --> 53:54.990
Merry Christmas!

53:59.302 --> 54:00.462
Stop!

54:35.472 --> 54:37.599
Should've bought a calendar.

54:38.241 --> 54:40.641
Gonna need it where you're going.

54:47.817 --> 54:48.943
What do you want?

54:49.019 --> 54:52.045
lt's me, Spike Frohmeyer.
You know, Vic's kid.

54:52.122 --> 54:53.316
Yeah.

54:53.823 --> 54:57.418
lf he says Trogdon loaned him the tree,
then he's telling the truth.

54:57.494 --> 55:00.088
Here's the key. lt's not a burglary.

55:02.098 --> 55:03.224
Key.

55:07.203 --> 55:08.727
Scram, Krank.

55:14.511 --> 55:17.537
Thanks, Spike. l was kind of scared in there.

55:18.281 --> 55:21.614
You'll be all right.
Try to relax, will you, Luther?

55:25.155 --> 55:26.588
Get the tree.

55:35.098 --> 55:37.760
-What happened?
-Unload the car.

55:38.034 --> 55:40.002
-What's wrong?
-Nobody's coming.

55:40.070 --> 55:42.504
l've called everybody we know,
they're all busy.

55:42.572 --> 55:45.769
-We'll have to invite the neighbors.
-Over my dead body.

55:45.842 --> 55:47.867
-How's the tree?
-Well....

55:51.581 --> 55:53.208
lt's a disaster.

55:53.717 --> 55:55.412
Take it or leave it.

55:55.485 --> 56:00.184
Blue icicles and a Chicago Bear ornament?
Popcorn. Those aren't mine.

56:01.091 --> 56:04.458
-Smoked trout.
-Better than frozen pizza.

56:05.795 --> 56:08.525
What happened to the hickory honey ham?

56:11.735 --> 56:15.296
Never say ''hickory honey ham'' again.

56:19.676 --> 56:22.907
Hello. Blair! Hi, honey!

56:22.979 --> 56:25.379
l'd like to talk to her
to send her back to Peru.

56:25.448 --> 56:27.416
You're in Atlanta? Wow.

56:27.584 --> 56:31.486
We're just busy cooking away here,
getting ready for the party.

56:31.654 --> 56:35.090
Of course l'm making caramel cream pie,
your favorite.

56:36.326 --> 56:38.817
We'll be there at 8:00 to pick you up.

56:38.895 --> 56:41.887
l can't wait to see you, too. l love you. Bye.

56:44.067 --> 56:47.867
lt's 4:30. l need two pounds of caramel
and a jar of marshmallow cream.

56:47.937 --> 56:51.464
The liquor store closes at 5:00
and they're holding a case of Pinot Noir.

56:51.541 --> 56:52.974
A case of wine for the four of us?

56:53.042 --> 56:56.011
Shut up. How long will it take you
to put up Frosty?

56:56.079 --> 56:57.239
-Three days.
-Great!

56:57.313 --> 57:00.908
When you finish, call all the neighbors
and invite them to the party.

57:00.984 --> 57:02.383
What party?

57:42.792 --> 57:44.692
Merry Christmas, Nora.

57:46.229 --> 57:48.356
Merry Christmas to you, too.

57:49.499 --> 57:51.763
Why are you out running around?

57:51.968 --> 57:54.630
Just picking up last-minute stuff. You?

57:54.871 --> 57:57.840
Picking up some stuff. Few things.

58:00.710 --> 58:02.075
Big party tomorrow?

58:02.278 --> 58:06.612
Actually, it's tonight. My daughter's
coming back from South America.

58:06.916 --> 58:10.943
We're just throwing a little party.
She's bringing her new boyfriend.

58:11.254 --> 58:12.448
Blair.

58:14.824 --> 58:15.882
Yes.

58:20.997 --> 58:22.897
Would you like to come?

58:23.833 --> 58:25.391
You mean that?

58:26.836 --> 58:29.304
Absolutely. l mean, it's just drop-in.

58:29.439 --> 58:30.804
What time?

58:32.208 --> 58:33.368
8:30.

58:33.810 --> 58:36.711
-You're on Hemlock?
-Yes, 1 482.

58:37.247 --> 58:40.307
Thank you. Yes, thank you.

58:43.553 --> 58:44.986
Who are you?

58:46.623 --> 58:48.022
Not a clue.

58:57.233 --> 58:59.360
You get heavier every year.

58:59.536 --> 59:00.696
Up here!

59:01.104 --> 59:02.435
Come on.

59:02.505 --> 59:04.405
There we go.

59:18.755 --> 59:20.245
l see Frosty.

59:21.157 --> 59:25.651
Kids! Guys!
Mr. Krank is putting up his Frosty.

59:25.962 --> 59:27.293
Let's go.

59:38.741 --> 59:41.733
Come on. Straighten up there. Near perfect.

59:44.948 --> 59:47.382
-Good evening, Luther!
-Hey!

59:49.886 --> 59:51.877
You need some help, buddy?

59:52.922 --> 59:54.014
No.

59:54.424 --> 59:56.619
Luther, hold on.

59:57.961 --> 59:59.656
Watch your balance!

01:00:03.299 --> 01:00:05.460
Easy! Careful!

01:00:06.703 --> 01:00:09.035
Careful, Luther!

01:00:10.073 --> 01:00:13.065
Back. We got to go back that way.

01:00:29.926 --> 01:00:31.120
Look out!

01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:46.172
You okay?

01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:49.501
Swell, Vic. Thanks. How about you?

01:00:49.579 --> 01:00:51.979
l called 91 1 . They're on the way.

01:00:52.048 --> 01:00:54.380
-Thanks, Walt.
-Bev made me.

01:00:56.786 --> 01:01:00.415
-lt was up on the roof just a minute ago.
-ls he all right?

01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:03.622
Poor Frosty.

01:01:03.693 --> 01:01:05.627
Yeah, ''poor Frosty'' my eye.

01:01:07.397 --> 01:01:08.864
He's okay!

01:01:09.132 --> 01:01:11.293
You should just let me drop. Let me fall.

01:01:12.035 --> 01:01:13.229
He's all right.

01:01:13.302 --> 01:01:16.135
What on earth are you doing? Are you okay?

01:01:16.272 --> 01:01:18.433
Actually, it was a suicide attempt.

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:21.739
Apparently, l misread the instructions.
Put my leg to sleep, though.

01:01:21.844 --> 01:01:25.780
He was up there by himself,
trying to put up your Frosty.

01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:30.714
-Sweetie, here they come.
-Here come the pros. Guys.

01:01:31.554 --> 01:01:34.819
Just hold on. l guess you can't, can you?

01:01:35.425 --> 01:01:36.722
Hurry up!

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:40.220
Back off, l'll be all right.
Move away. Let these guys handle it.

01:01:40.296 --> 01:01:43.891
Thanks. Just a little problem with the rope.
lf you could just untie it.

01:01:43.966 --> 01:01:47.129
Get a ladder, that would be helpful.
But l don't know....

01:01:47.303 --> 01:01:50.431
What are you gonna do
with those clippers, guys?

01:01:50.606 --> 01:01:51.834
Got him?

01:01:55.445 --> 01:01:56.673
You okay?

01:01:58.781 --> 01:02:00.510
Dudes, over here.

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:03.852
Slow down. That's good. Over here, man.

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:08.114
Folks, move back.

01:02:08.291 --> 01:02:09.451
What's going on here?

01:02:09.525 --> 01:02:13.689
Luther here was up on the roof putting up
Frosty and then they both fell off.

01:02:13.763 --> 01:02:14.957
Coming through.

01:02:15.031 --> 01:02:18.432
l thought you were skipping Christmas
this year, Mr. Krank.

01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:21.129
What about that? What's going on there?

01:02:22.071 --> 01:02:24.505
Blair's coming home for Christmas.

01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:31.437
And she's bringing her boyfriend.

01:02:35.051 --> 01:02:37.679
-And she expects to see a Christmas tree?
-Yeah.

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:39.745
-And a Frosty?
-Of course.

01:02:39.922 --> 01:02:43.380
And what about
the annual Kranks' Christmas Eve party?

01:02:43.926 --> 01:02:45.188
That, too.

01:02:45.261 --> 01:02:48.628
-When does she get in?
-Plane arrives about 8:00.

01:02:53.035 --> 01:02:55.697
All right, people, listen up. Gather around.

01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:58.900
We're about to have a party here
at the Kranks'.

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:02.210
A Christmas homecoming for Blair.

01:03:02.311 --> 01:03:04.040
Great idea, Vic.

01:03:04.113 --> 01:03:07.480
Drop what you're doing and pitch in.
Nora, do you have a turkey?

01:03:08.718 --> 01:03:10.151
Smoked trout.

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:12.253
Smoked trout?

01:03:17.527 --> 01:03:18.892
Anybody got a turkey?

01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:21.953
-We have two, both in the oven.
-Beautiful. Get them.

01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:25.159
Ned, go to Brixley's. Get his Frosty.
Get some lights, too.

01:03:25.234 --> 01:03:26.997
We'll put them along Luther's boxwoods.

01:03:27.069 --> 01:03:31.165
-Hold on. Why should we do this for him?
-Yeah. He's a jerk.

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:35.809
Regardless of how you feel about him--
A lot of you have mixed feelings about him.

01:03:35.878 --> 01:03:39.314
But we're a community.
The people in a community stick together.

01:03:39.382 --> 01:03:42.840
Even if one of them has been behaving,
for most of the holiday season...

01:03:42.919 --> 01:03:45.251
like a spoiled, selfish little baby.

01:03:45.688 --> 01:03:49.180
We're not doing this for him.
We're doing this for Blair.

01:03:50.259 --> 01:03:53.057
Blair, who used to baby-sit all your kids.

01:03:53.129 --> 01:03:57.361
Blair, who comes home every summer
and makes us all feel like family.

01:03:57.567 --> 01:03:58.761
That's right.

01:03:58.835 --> 01:04:02.293
Why should the daughter pay
for the sins of the father?

01:04:03.606 --> 01:04:06.871
Now, if we even have a hope of pulling
this off, you got to scatter.

01:04:06.943 --> 01:04:11.403
Grab a change of clothes and all the food
you can, and get over here in half an hour.

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:13.880
-Let's go.
-Randy, Mike, let's go.

01:04:14.951 --> 01:04:17.419
-Thank you!
-You're welcome, Nora.

01:04:17.587 --> 01:04:19.885
Guys, better go to the airport.

01:04:20.122 --> 01:04:22.716
-Why's that?
-Blair needs a ride home.

01:04:24.126 --> 01:04:26.560
l don't know if we could do that.

01:04:28.731 --> 01:04:30.631
Shall l call the chief?

01:04:33.536 --> 01:04:35.163
We could do that.

01:04:41.677 --> 01:04:43.508
Got a hold of Frosty there?

01:04:43.579 --> 01:04:46.070
Easy. Up he goes.

01:04:46.249 --> 01:04:47.773
There you go.

01:04:53.956 --> 01:04:55.218
Finally.

01:04:56.225 --> 01:04:58.386
There's nothing like a white Christmas.

01:04:59.128 --> 01:05:00.789
Merry Christmas!

01:05:01.364 --> 01:05:02.763
Hi, everybody!

01:05:05.434 --> 01:05:07.834
-Hey, boss!
-Hey, guys. Come on in.

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:09.394
Aubie. Thank you.

01:05:15.945 --> 01:05:17.105
What are these?

01:05:19.148 --> 01:05:20.172
Honey.

01:05:21.951 --> 01:05:23.077
These illegal?

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:39.691
Here. l have that one piece you need.

01:05:42.371 --> 01:05:44.305
l think that should go over there.

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:50.270
Honey, look. Look. Mistletoe.

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:54.776
Hello?

01:05:55.351 --> 01:05:57.046
-Hey, Blair.
-Blair?

01:05:58.454 --> 01:06:00.786
-You're 55 minutes early.
-What?

01:06:01.057 --> 01:06:05.084
That's a heck of a tail wind. Yeah.
That's great.

01:06:06.896 --> 01:06:10.161
We're waiting right here.
Can't wait to see you.

01:06:10.232 --> 01:06:11.290
Love you, honey.

01:06:11.367 --> 01:06:13.699
That was your mom. We both love you.
Bye-bye.

01:06:13.769 --> 01:06:17.535
-What are we gonna do? We'll never make it.
-No, l got an idea. Hold it.

01:06:20.576 --> 01:06:21.600
Go!

01:06:21.777 --> 01:06:23.108
Go, Spike!

01:06:23.279 --> 01:06:26.680
Anything else that's in a box,
just put it down in the cellar.

01:06:26.749 --> 01:06:28.649
You know what? lt looks good.

01:06:32.955 --> 01:06:35.890
-See them?
-l don't see my parents anywhere.

01:06:47.203 --> 01:06:48.261
Honey.

01:06:49.038 --> 01:06:50.369
ls that us?

01:07:00.216 --> 01:07:03.549
Hi, l'm Blair. This is Enrique.

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:07.616
A police escort? l'm impressed.

01:07:08.057 --> 01:07:11.891
l guess my dad was really generous
with his donation this year.

01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:14.860
Yeah. You have no idea.

01:07:15.097 --> 01:07:17.565
Thirty-seven minutes, my friends.

01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:24.161
Welcome to the United States.
Hand me those bags.

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:28.336
Officer Frohmeyer here. Do you read me?

01:07:28.411 --> 01:07:30.971
How many times l got to tell you, stay off--

01:07:31.047 --> 01:07:33.277
This is serious. Can you talk?

01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:37.378
-Yeah, go.
-We need to stall.

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:39.646
-Stall?
-We're ready.

01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:40.711
We're not ready.

01:07:42.224 --> 01:07:44.317
Okay. Stall.

01:07:44.994 --> 01:07:47.519
l'll get it, thanks.

01:07:48.197 --> 01:07:51.496
-Merry Christmas, Luther. Here's a ham.
-Can l help you?

01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:55.059
l'm sorry. l'm a little bit early.
lt's cold out there.

01:07:55.237 --> 01:07:58.400
-Why don't you go in? Enjoy yourself.
-l'm so happy to be here.

01:07:58.908 --> 01:08:01.741
Father Zabriskie,
it's so nice to see you again.

01:08:01.811 --> 01:08:02.800
Thank you.

01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:07.678
-l don't know who he is.
-He brings ham.

01:08:26.202 --> 01:08:28.363
Why are you driving so slow?

01:08:29.270 --> 01:08:30.670
lcy roads.

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:35.042
Want to celebrate Christmas
under a mistletoe or in a body bag?

01:08:45.787 --> 01:08:48.221
-Can l help you with that?
-Thank you.

01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:50.850
-Good.
-Here we go.

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:55.090
Honey, l talked to everyone.
No one knows that guy.

01:08:55.598 --> 01:08:57.759
He knows them.

01:08:57.832 --> 01:08:59.528
What is.... How do.... What?

01:08:59.602 --> 01:09:01.001
Thanks, Father.

01:09:01.871 --> 01:09:03.862
-Robbie, check that bottom string.
-Yes, sir.

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:06.100
That's good enough.
We don't have much time.

01:09:06.175 --> 01:09:07.836
Randy, plug it in.

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:26.325
Sweet.

01:09:28.063 --> 01:09:29.928
lt's just the lights.

01:09:31.033 --> 01:09:34.491
-l'll go check the breaker.
-l'd better go help Luther.

01:09:37.706 --> 01:09:40.004
Do you know anybody at ComEd?

01:09:42.077 --> 01:09:46.069
<i>Officer Frohmeyer here. Do you read me?</i>
<i>Hurry, I'm running on batteries.</i>

01:09:47.316 --> 01:09:50.716
-What's up, Spike, sir?
-We need more time.

01:09:52.087 --> 01:09:55.113
-Roger.
-What was that? Talking about time.

01:09:56.158 --> 01:09:58.388
He said crime.

01:09:58.827 --> 01:10:03.196
Possible domestic disturbance.
We'd better check it out.

01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:06.126
What are you talking about?

01:10:17.179 --> 01:10:20.979
We'll put those down here on the table,
l think, just as the entr�e.

01:10:22.952 --> 01:10:26.046
Aubie, put the cookies over there
on the edge of the table.

01:10:27.556 --> 01:10:31.959
-There was a box with some balls in it--
-You took the big box downstairs.

01:10:35.331 --> 01:10:36.662
Finally!

01:10:39.268 --> 01:10:40.895
Wonderful!

01:10:42.004 --> 01:10:45.804
-lt looks wonderful, everybody.
-Place looks great.

01:10:45.874 --> 01:10:48.240
She's gonna be here any minute!

01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:52.508
Honey, l need to do something
about your tan, and we need to change.

01:10:53.482 --> 01:10:56.451
Will you please tell me
what the hell is going on here?

01:10:56.652 --> 01:10:58.381
We got to stall.

01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:02.413
Just for a few minutes
until they get the party started.

01:11:02.491 --> 01:11:03.856
Okay.

01:11:05.327 --> 01:11:09.263
See, it's fine. Just checkup.

01:11:09.431 --> 01:11:12.491
Let's walk over to this door
like we're investigating something.

01:11:12.568 --> 01:11:15.230
l'll put my hand on my gun,
make it look official.

01:11:15.604 --> 01:11:18.072
Yeah, you do that, Mr. Terminator.

01:11:23.212 --> 01:11:24.804
l look like my mother.

01:11:25.414 --> 01:11:27.712
And she's been dead, what, 15 years?

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:31.818
That's enough time. Let's go back to the car.

01:11:31.887 --> 01:11:32.945
Okay.

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:39.393
What was that? Looks like a break-in.

01:11:39.461 --> 01:11:41.554
-No way.
-Yes way.

01:11:42.097 --> 01:11:44.292
l don't need this. Not now.

01:11:44.366 --> 01:11:47.028
Break-in rate is very high on Christmas Eve.

01:11:47.102 --> 01:11:49.502
l know that, but we got a party to go to.

01:11:49.571 --> 01:11:51.937
So, what do you want to do, ignore it?

01:11:55.277 --> 01:11:56.904
We can't do that.

01:12:00.416 --> 01:12:02.281
-There he is.
-Police!

01:12:02.484 --> 01:12:03.746
Eat this!

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:07.645
Go get him. Go on, get going.

01:12:17.766 --> 01:12:21.133
Get up! Come on, he's getting away.
Hurry up!

01:12:21.303 --> 01:12:23.897
What are you doing lying there?
He's getting away.

01:12:24.206 --> 01:12:27.004
All right, don't move.
Stay right where you are.

01:12:27.076 --> 01:12:28.236
Police.

01:12:29.712 --> 01:12:31.373
-Get him!
-Police.

01:12:37.619 --> 01:12:39.644
All right! We got him.

01:12:47.963 --> 01:12:51.831
Honey, this is gonna be
Enrique's first Christmas in America.

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:54.061
l hope we make a good impression.

01:12:54.136 --> 01:12:56.001
Nora, are you sure about this?

01:12:57.005 --> 01:13:00.600
-l look like a Mafia lieutenant.
-The black makes your skin look lighter.

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:04.813
And Blair is never to know about the cruise.
Do you understand?

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:07.212
l heard you the first 60 times.

01:13:13.522 --> 01:13:15.046
Frohmeyer One to Frohmeyer Two.

01:13:15.124 --> 01:13:17.888
<i>-The Eagle has landed.</i>
-Roger.

01:13:18.193 --> 01:13:20.821
Ned! They're here!

01:13:21.363 --> 01:13:23.524
-l'm not finished.
-Hide!

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:44.549
Guys, Blair's here!

01:13:47.022 --> 01:13:48.182
l see her!

01:13:49.358 --> 01:13:52.191
-They're here!
-What if we don't like him?

01:13:53.128 --> 01:13:55.096
We raised a smart girl.

01:13:55.164 --> 01:13:56.631
Welcome home!

01:13:56.698 --> 01:13:58.598
They're getting out of the car!

01:13:58.667 --> 01:14:01.864
She's home! Everybody, she's here!

01:14:02.037 --> 01:14:03.299
Good to see you.

01:14:03.372 --> 01:14:05.306
-Who's this?
-Enrique, my boyfriend.

01:14:05.374 --> 01:14:08.605
-Vic Frohmeyer. Pleased to meet you.
-Pleased to meet you, sir.

01:14:08.677 --> 01:14:10.542
This is so exciting. Hi, guys.

01:14:10.612 --> 01:14:15.276
Your parents are dying to see you.
Didn't Luther do a great job on the house?

01:14:17.986 --> 01:14:19.544
Honey, they're here!

01:14:21.824 --> 01:14:25.316
-l can't believe l'm home.
-We can't believe you're home, either.

01:14:25.394 --> 01:14:26.588
Dad.

01:14:28.197 --> 01:14:32.293
-Luther Krank. This is Nora, my wife.
-Hi, l'm Enrique DeCardenal.

01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:34.527
Come here, you!

01:14:34.837 --> 01:14:37.670
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas to you.

01:14:38.407 --> 01:14:41.467
-You guys look great.
-We've been watching what we eat.

01:14:41.543 --> 01:14:43.977
-And you've been in the sun.
-No, we have not.

01:14:44.046 --> 01:14:46.844
No. l wear black to make me look lighter.

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:53.846
The party! Look, there's the party!
Come on, it's the party!

01:14:53.922 --> 01:14:56.857
Everybody, look! Party!

01:14:57.593 --> 01:14:59.083
Nice to see you.

01:14:59.261 --> 01:15:01.627
l'll take the light one, you take the rest.

01:15:01.697 --> 01:15:03.392
Hey, Aubie, how are you?

01:15:08.770 --> 01:15:09.930
Kid.

01:15:10.973 --> 01:15:12.372
Come here.

01:15:13.075 --> 01:15:14.667
l'm freezing to death.

01:15:14.743 --> 01:15:17.644
l'm starving out here.
l haven't eaten in seven days.

01:15:17.713 --> 01:15:19.374
-Seven days?
-Yeah.

01:15:19.848 --> 01:15:22.510
Any scraps l get, l give to the kids.

01:15:23.585 --> 01:15:26.247
-What kids?
-My kids.

01:15:26.922 --> 01:15:30.858
l got four: Annie, Billy, Tommy, and Chuck.

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:35.721
And all l wanted to do was give them
a real Christmas this year.

01:15:35.797 --> 01:15:37.458
They deserve it.

01:15:41.103 --> 01:15:45.267
Okay, you got 20 minutes inside.
Enough time to get warm, grab some food.

01:15:45.574 --> 01:15:49.169
Then it's back to the police car.
No funny business, right?

01:15:50.145 --> 01:15:51.373
Swear?

01:15:51.914 --> 01:15:53.609
On my kids' lives.

01:15:55.317 --> 01:15:58.377
Have to try hickory honey ham.

01:15:58.453 --> 01:16:01.786
lt's Blairey's absolute favorite. lt's a classic.

01:16:04.493 --> 01:16:07.758
-The food's that way.
-Thanks, son. l appreciate it.

01:16:07.963 --> 01:16:11.023
-We've had ham since she was a little girl.
-Welcome home, Blair.

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:14.234
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

01:16:15.804 --> 01:16:17.635
l suppose this is your boyfriend.

01:16:17.706 --> 01:16:20.675
-Yes. Honey.
-Hi, l'm Enrique DeCardenal.

01:16:20.742 --> 01:16:23.677
-Call me Marty.
-Houston, we have a name.

01:16:23.745 --> 01:16:26.737
-ls that a Peruvian accent?
-How could you tell?

01:16:26.982 --> 01:16:30.782
l lived there for five years. l miss it so much.

01:16:41.363 --> 01:16:44.662
-l'm going to talk to Marty for a second.
-Okay. Go ahead.

01:16:44.733 --> 01:16:46.325
He's charming.

01:16:46.401 --> 01:16:49.666
-Who is that?
-You know Marty. Everybody knows Marty.

01:16:56.311 --> 01:16:58.006
Merry Christmas.

01:16:58.547 --> 01:17:00.242
Aren't you sweet?

01:17:01.249 --> 01:17:02.511
Bless you.

01:18:07.115 --> 01:18:10.107
l would like to propose a toast, if l may.

01:18:10.852 --> 01:18:14.913
Here's to my new family and friends.

01:18:15.090 --> 01:18:19.390
Thank you for making me feel so welcome.

01:18:32.107 --> 01:18:35.565
And l just wanted to say...

01:18:36.545 --> 01:18:38.809
thank you to all of you.

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:42.043
To our friends and our neighbors...

01:18:42.718 --> 01:18:44.913
for helping us make this...

01:18:44.986 --> 01:18:48.444
really, the most wonderful
Christmas Eve ever.

01:18:49.024 --> 01:18:52.619
You really have shown us
the true meaning of community.

01:18:52.694 --> 01:18:54.525
And thank you all so much.

01:18:54.596 --> 01:18:56.086
Merry Christmas.

01:19:09.745 --> 01:19:11.804
Same goes for me, double.

01:19:17.552 --> 01:19:18.780
Cheers.

01:19:19.888 --> 01:19:22.516
Fellas, how about a party tune?

01:19:36.304 --> 01:19:37.328
G.

01:20:07.469 --> 01:20:10.927
That was it?
That was the best you could come up with?

01:20:11.273 --> 01:20:13.537
l'm not really good at toasts.

01:20:16.011 --> 01:20:18.002
After all they've done...

01:20:19.347 --> 01:20:22.646
you couldn't just come up
with a simple ''thank you''?

01:20:23.451 --> 01:20:25.544
l did. lt was just short and sweet.

01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:34.023
You're still moping...

01:20:34.095 --> 01:20:37.656
because you don't get to go
on your precious little cruise.

01:20:37.732 --> 01:20:39.495
There's still time.

01:20:39.801 --> 01:20:41.792
-What?
-We could still go.

01:20:42.571 --> 01:20:44.004
Listen to me.

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:48.669
Enrique and Blair can stay here,
have the house to themselves.

01:20:48.743 --> 01:20:51.576
We go, and we all have a romantic getaway.

01:20:51.646 --> 01:20:55.742
Your daughter just flew
thousands of miles home...

01:20:55.917 --> 01:20:58.613
with her very sweet future husband...

01:20:58.687 --> 01:21:00.814
to spend Christmas with us.

01:21:00.889 --> 01:21:02.220
You know...

01:21:03.391 --> 01:21:05.985
l've spent six weeks planning
for this vacation.

01:21:06.061 --> 01:21:08.723
That's longer than they've been dating.

01:21:11.733 --> 01:21:15.601
Everyone out there sacrificed
their Christmas Eve to help us.

01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:21.002
l thought maybe that might affect you.

01:21:21.243 --> 01:21:25.976
Maybe have you start thinking about
putting others first instead of yourself.

01:21:26.982 --> 01:21:29.712
But l really don't think that's possible.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.244
lt's a shame.

01:21:39.027 --> 01:21:40.517
Why don't we move in a little?

01:21:49.037 --> 01:21:52.336
Hi, how are you? Merry Christmas to you.

01:21:53.475 --> 01:21:55.170
lt's cold out there.

01:22:22.137 --> 01:22:23.468
Bravo!

01:22:41.890 --> 01:22:43.448
Luther!

01:22:48.797 --> 01:22:50.059
Frosty?

01:23:05.814 --> 01:23:08.442
Merry Christmas, Luther.

01:23:08.516 --> 01:23:10.643
Merry Christmas to you, too, Walt.

01:23:10.719 --> 01:23:14.018
-You're missing your party.
-Well, there's....

01:23:15.623 --> 01:23:16.954
How's Bev?

01:23:17.092 --> 01:23:19.925
She's having a good day. Yeah, thanks.

01:23:20.428 --> 01:23:24.831
We started over to see Blair,
but, you know, the snow started and....

01:23:26.468 --> 01:23:28.436
So how's the boyfriend?

01:23:28.837 --> 01:23:32.068
You know, actually,
he's a very nice young man.

01:23:32.607 --> 01:23:35.804
-Merry Christmas, Luther.
-Merry Christmas to you, too, Bev.

01:23:35.877 --> 01:23:39.176
-You feeling okay?
-That was a pretty nasty fall.

01:23:39.381 --> 01:23:43.112
lt could've been worse.
l mean, that cord could've snapped and....

01:23:44.352 --> 01:23:47.185
You know, Nora wanted me to drop this by.

01:23:47.889 --> 01:23:52.189
l'm allergic to pork,
and Bev's not much of a meat-eater.

01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:55.855
Not to worry, because Mel's hams
are generally just filled...

01:23:55.930 --> 01:23:59.388
with a gelatin and a fat-like substance.
Please.

01:23:59.467 --> 01:24:01.697
lt's very thoughtful, Luther.

01:24:07.509 --> 01:24:09.602
You know, have a good one.

01:25:33.461 --> 01:25:35.725
Could l come in for a minute?

01:25:38.032 --> 01:25:39.260
Thanks.

01:25:42.904 --> 01:25:45.998
Blair's gonna be staying with us
for 10 days...

01:25:46.241 --> 01:25:48.505
so we're not taking the cruise.

01:25:48.576 --> 01:25:51.909
And Nora and l would like you guys
to have it.

01:25:55.383 --> 01:25:57.317
Flight leaves at 1 2:00 noon tomorrow.

01:25:57.385 --> 01:26:00.149
You got to be there
two hours ahead of time.

01:26:00.255 --> 01:26:04.248
lt's 10 days in the Caribbean.
lslands and beaches. The works.

01:26:06.027 --> 01:26:07.961
lt's a dream vacation.

01:26:11.666 --> 01:26:14.533
We can't take it, Luther. lt's not right.

01:26:14.836 --> 01:26:17.430
l didn't purchase the travel insurance.

01:26:17.505 --> 01:26:20.838
So if you don't take it,
the whole package is wasted.

01:26:20.909 --> 01:26:23.571
l'm not sure my doctor would allow it.

01:26:24.279 --> 01:26:27.908
l've got that Lexon deal on the front burner.

01:26:27.982 --> 01:26:30.382
Benny said he might stop by tomorrow.

01:26:30.451 --> 01:26:32.681
And we couldn't leave the cat.

01:26:34.055 --> 01:26:35.920
This is from us to you.

01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:39.289
This is a sincere, heartfelt...

01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:42.258
no-strings-attached Christmas offering...

01:26:42.897 --> 01:26:46.890
to two very selfless people
who are, at this moment...

01:26:47.402 --> 01:26:50.667
having a very difficult time
looking for an excuse.

01:26:53.374 --> 01:26:55.672
Benny did say he might stop by.

01:26:58.213 --> 01:27:01.876
Face it, Bev,
Benny hasn't been home in years.

01:27:05.119 --> 01:27:07.110
Look, l've got everything right here.

01:27:07.188 --> 01:27:11.147
l got airline tickets.
l got cruise passes. l've got a brochure.

01:27:11.993 --> 01:27:16.293
What's it cost? lf we decide to go,
we'd want to reimburse you.

01:27:16.531 --> 01:27:18.431
This is a simple gift, Walt.

01:27:19.133 --> 01:27:22.933
No costs, no payback.
Don't make it complicated.

01:27:28.476 --> 01:27:32.435
-Our names aren't on the tickets.
-l know. l'll take care of that.

01:27:32.513 --> 01:27:34.276
What about the cat?

01:27:34.582 --> 01:27:38.143
Yeah, that's a problem, huh?
Too late to call the kennel.

01:27:38.219 --> 01:27:40.210
We can't just leave him.

01:27:40.622 --> 01:27:42.954
We could ask Jude Becker.

01:27:43.424 --> 01:27:45.016
She's allergic.

01:27:47.428 --> 01:27:49.157
l'll take the cat.

01:27:49.731 --> 01:27:51.892
-What?
-Are you sure?

01:27:53.001 --> 01:27:54.093
Yeah.

01:27:54.936 --> 01:27:56.870
Look at that.

01:27:58.773 --> 01:28:02.300
See? Maybe if you don't step on him
so often....

01:28:02.710 --> 01:28:04.871
Yeah. lt'll be fine.

01:28:09.384 --> 01:28:12.717
-Thank you so much.
-Merry Christmas.

01:28:13.988 --> 01:28:17.549
Well, l should get back to my party.

01:28:28.770 --> 01:28:31.000
This means so much.

01:28:32.974 --> 01:28:34.305
Thank you.

01:28:35.877 --> 01:28:37.469
You're welcome.

01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:42.775
Does this mean we have to start
being nice to each other?

01:28:44.118 --> 01:28:46.450
-Of course not.
-Good.

01:28:47.422 --> 01:28:50.482
Because l still don't like you
that much, old man.

01:28:50.558 --> 01:28:51.923
That's good.

01:28:53.328 --> 01:28:55.762
l'm not that fond of you, either.

01:29:05.573 --> 01:29:07.473
Bev, we gotta pack!

01:29:09.844 --> 01:29:12.438
Luther! Help me!

01:29:14.749 --> 01:29:18.082
Ned!
What in God's name are you doing up there?

01:29:18.486 --> 01:29:20.113
Blair came home.

01:29:20.788 --> 01:29:22.983
Frohmeyer took down the ladder.

01:29:23.057 --> 01:29:25.855
He went inside, forgot about me.

01:29:26.928 --> 01:29:29.590
Have you been up there all this time?

01:29:33.134 --> 01:29:35.602
l'm frozen, stuck to Frosty!

01:29:36.170 --> 01:29:37.865
l'll get you down!

01:29:51.219 --> 01:29:53.016
What are you doing?

01:29:53.454 --> 01:29:55.718
You swore on your kids' lives!

01:29:56.324 --> 01:29:59.691
-What kids?
-Help! Police!

01:30:06.634 --> 01:30:08.158
Easy, come on.

01:30:09.404 --> 01:30:11.838
Go on inside. Drink something hot.

01:30:15.977 --> 01:30:18.912
Get down from there. Get down off the roof!

01:30:21.416 --> 01:30:22.883
My car.

01:30:23.184 --> 01:30:24.583
You all right?

01:30:26.087 --> 01:30:27.850
What's in that bag?

01:30:31.058 --> 01:30:32.320
Not bad.

01:30:33.728 --> 01:30:37.994
Good job, Santa. All right, come on.
Get up here. Let's go.

01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:43.602
-You swore to me.
-l'm growing tired of catching you.

01:30:47.208 --> 01:30:51.235
-What's this all about? What's going on?
-l told you you could use an umbrella.

01:30:51.846 --> 01:30:52.972
What?

01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:00.820
-Marty.
-Yes.

01:31:02.757 --> 01:31:06.818
Wait. You're the guy that was selling
the umbrellas in the rain, aren't you?

01:31:06.894 --> 01:31:09.727
lt's a living.
l meet a lot of nice people this way.

01:31:09.797 --> 01:31:13.426
l got to run because l can't pass up
this kind of weather.

01:31:13.501 --> 01:31:16.470
lt's always good for business.
Thank you for the party.

01:31:16.537 --> 01:31:19.836
You're welcome.
l'm sorry you got to work on Christmas Eve.

01:31:19.907 --> 01:31:23.399
Santa always has to work on Christmas Eve.

01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:27.571
Yeah, l suppose he does.

01:31:37.592 --> 01:31:39.184
Merry Christmas!

01:32:03.084 --> 01:32:04.984
Bev Scheel just called.

01:32:07.255 --> 01:32:09.382
Maybe l was wrong about you.

01:32:19.133 --> 01:32:21.499
This night is full of surprises.

01:32:25.406 --> 01:32:28.739
Skipping Christmas. What a stupid idea.

01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:31.239
Maybe next year.

01:33:13.888 --> 01:33:17.119
Merry Christmas!
