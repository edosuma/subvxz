02:11.583 --> 02:13.165
- Again?
- Yeah.

02:13.250 --> 02:14.661
- Are you sure?
- Double sure.

02:15.833 --> 02:17.199
Here we go.

02:19.750 --> 02:21.457
Yeah. Done you again, Hibbert.

02:21.583 --> 02:23.825
- You're a bloody cheat.
- Language.

02:25.542 --> 02:27.534
One last kiss.
I might never see you again.

02:27.625 --> 02:30.663
Hibbert. Time to parade.

02:43.333 --> 02:44.619
Stanhope.

02:45.958 --> 02:47.119
It's time.

02:51.500 --> 02:52.991
Here we go again.

02:59.333 --> 03:01.245
That's for you, son.

03:01.375 --> 03:03.241
<i>Merci.</i>

03:05.625 --> 03:07.787
<i>- Au revoir, mademoiselle.
- Bonne chance, monsieur.</i>

03:09.083 --> 03:10.449
<i>Merci.</i>

03:42.417 --> 03:47.742
Company, right turn!

03:54.750 --> 03:57.618
- All present and correct, sir.
- Thank you, Sergeant Major.

03:57.708 --> 03:59.074
Sir.

04:04.833 --> 04:08.156
Company, by the centre!

04:08.250 --> 04:09.832
Quick march!

04:10.000 --> 04:14.040
Left right, left right,
left right, left!

04:14.167 --> 04:18.081
Left right, left right,
left right, left!

04:18.166 --> 04:21.990
Left right, left right,
left right, left!

04:22.083 --> 04:25.656
Left right, left right,
left right, left...

04:57.042 --> 04:59.034
Here we go, lads.
Out you get.

05:07.167 --> 05:09.079
Transport office over there, sir.

05:17.125 --> 05:18.411
Sir.

05:26.208 --> 05:27.574
Lieutenant?

05:28.667 --> 05:30.408
Second Lieutenant Raleigh, sir.

05:32.792 --> 05:34.784
You're to report
to the officers' quarters,

05:34.875 --> 05:36.787
down the bottom on the right.

05:37.250 --> 05:39.583
And do you know
where I could find the General?

05:39.750 --> 05:41.036
Yes, he's in the stable block,

05:41.125 --> 05:43.412
but that's all off limits to you,
Lieutenant.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.081
Sir.

05:59.167 --> 06:00.874
Left, right, left, right!

06:01.042 --> 06:03.659
Attention. Attention!

06:04.417 --> 06:07.080
By the left! Quick march!

06:07.208 --> 06:10.872
Left right, left right,
left right, left...

06:20.250 --> 06:22.788
- Yes, sir?
- Is this the General's office?

06:22.875 --> 06:24.741
It is, sir. Now's not a good time, sir.

06:24.833 --> 06:27.576
Could you tell him his nephew's here
to say hello?

06:27.750 --> 06:29.082
Yes, sir.

06:36.167 --> 06:38.659
- Follow me, sir.
- Righto.

06:47.875 --> 06:50.037
Draw to a close now. Carry on.

06:50.167 --> 06:51.453
Sir.

06:54.958 --> 06:57.041
Your father put you up
to this?

06:57.792 --> 06:58.828
Sir?

06:59.417 --> 07:01.158
What is it you're after?

07:01.250 --> 07:03.412
An old school friend is out here, sir,

07:03.583 --> 07:05.825
and when I'm posted to my unit,

07:06.125 --> 07:09.243
I wondered if it'd be possible
for it to be his battalion, sir?

07:09.958 --> 07:12.666
- Anyone I know?
- I don't think so.

07:12.792 --> 07:17.162
A scholarship boy. Stanhope.
MC at Vimy Ridge.

07:17.250 --> 07:19.458
- Captain Stanhope?
- Yes.

07:19.583 --> 07:23.031
We used to spend a lot of time together.
He's been out here almost three years.

07:23.125 --> 07:25.913
You don't want to join them,
not now of all times.

07:26.125 --> 07:28.833
- I do, sir.
- They may have a hell of a time of it.

07:28.917 --> 07:30.658
That's just what I'm hoping for, sir.

07:32.208 --> 07:33.574
Here you are, sir.

07:34.750 --> 07:38.539
I shouldn't make exceptions
just because I happen to be your uncle.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.287
No, sir.

07:40.375 --> 07:42.287
How are your father's crocuses?

07:42.958 --> 07:44.244
Not up to much.

07:44.333 --> 07:46.666
I told him he'd set them too deep.

07:46.750 --> 07:49.163
Had some grub?

07:49.250 --> 07:51.412
Yes, on the boat over, sir.

07:51.500 --> 07:52.957
Well, then...

08:11.583 --> 08:14.371
- Evacuation, Lieutenant?
- Just saving what we can, sir.

08:54.375 --> 08:56.458
Mr Osborne, go and find Captain Hardy.

08:56.542 --> 08:58.329
Righto, sir.

09:01.750 --> 09:04.367
Number Nine Platoon, to the right.
Come on.

09:06.417 --> 09:08.033
Come on, lads. Quickly.

09:08.167 --> 09:11.365
Come on. Keep coming.

09:11.458 --> 09:13.040
Straight down to the right.

09:13.167 --> 09:14.533
Keep going, boys.

09:14.625 --> 09:16.082
Eleven Platoon, to the right.

09:16.208 --> 09:17.619
Keep it moving. Come on.

09:21.417 --> 09:22.749
Sir.

09:24.500 --> 09:25.786
Sir.

09:28.042 --> 09:29.453
Hardy!

09:32.083 --> 09:35.656
- Hardy.
- All your fellas here then, Osborne?

09:35.792 --> 09:39.081
Stanhope's just sorting out the mess
you've left these trenches in.

09:39.208 --> 09:41.450
I wouldn't want to be
his second in command,

09:41.583 --> 09:43.245
sober old thing like you.

09:43.375 --> 09:46.243
If I wanted your sympathy, Hardy,
I'd ask for it.

09:46.375 --> 09:49.573
- You already have it, chum.
- Excuse me, sir.

09:49.750 --> 09:52.208
Big German attack
is expected any day now.

09:52.333 --> 09:53.619
We're off in the nick of time.

09:53.750 --> 09:56.367
Well, it's been expected
for more than a month.

09:56.458 --> 10:00.532
Well, but there's more Boche transport
coming up than usual.

10:00.625 --> 10:02.867
More trains puffing in
with reinforcements.

10:03.500 --> 10:04.741
We'll hear it again tonight,
I shouldn't wonder.

10:04.833 --> 10:06.449
How many days are you here for?

10:06.542 --> 10:09.580
- Six.
- Then you'll get it right in the neck.

10:09.667 --> 10:12.159
Thank you so much. I'll tell Stanhope.

10:12.250 --> 10:13.866
How is the old soak?

10:13.958 --> 10:15.995
Best company commander of the lot.

10:16.667 --> 10:18.249
He's a hard drinker.

10:19.208 --> 10:21.245
Let's get this over with.

10:25.583 --> 10:28.075
We need to check every inch
of this sector before nightfall.

10:28.208 --> 10:29.289
Yes, sir.

10:35.125 --> 10:37.617
We won't last five minutes
if the Germans attack.

10:38.375 --> 10:42.039
Good work, men. Let's get as much
of this sorted as soon as we can.

10:46.750 --> 10:48.241
- Be careful.
- Sir.

10:48.375 --> 10:50.867
We hold 200 yards of the line,
left and right.

10:50.958 --> 10:52.745
The Germans are just 60 yards
away from the sap.

10:52.833 --> 10:54.574
It's been stalemate
for well over a year.

10:54.792 --> 10:58.411
- Splintered trees on the right?
- What's left of the larch wood.

10:58.500 --> 11:00.492
- Well...
- Heap of bricks?

11:02.667 --> 11:05.205
- Yes, got it.
- Mauvais Farm.

11:05.750 --> 11:08.117
I had two fellas hit
by a sniper out there.

11:17.208 --> 11:20.042
Commanding officer
and his number two in here.

11:22.875 --> 11:24.707
Servants and signalmen through here.

11:27.750 --> 11:29.582
All of that. Yeah, no, no.

11:29.750 --> 11:33.744
Just bring the kettle and everything
and put that over here with the jugs.

11:33.833 --> 11:37.156
- Hello, Mason.
- Ah, just brewing up, sir.

11:37.250 --> 11:39.537
This way.
Other officers in here.

11:43.167 --> 11:44.908
What arrangements
do you make for the men?

11:45.000 --> 11:47.788
I don't know.
Sergeant Major sees to all that.

11:51.417 --> 11:52.749
Just get them sorted.

11:52.833 --> 11:54.165
Right.

11:55.750 --> 11:58.242
Hundred and fifteen rifle grenades.

11:58.833 --> 12:00.665
Shouldn't use 'em. They're a bit rusty.

12:00.750 --> 12:04.243
Five hundred Mills bombs or thereabouts.

12:07.208 --> 12:08.574
What about the rest?

12:09.333 --> 12:11.450
There is no rest.
We're taking it all with us.

12:13.667 --> 12:16.455
The last of the men are ready
to go back down behind the line, sir.

12:16.583 --> 12:19.326
- Righto. I'll be up in a jiffy.
- Sir.

12:19.417 --> 12:21.374
Not staying to see Stanhope?

12:21.458 --> 12:24.656
And risk facing his drunken wrath?
Not likely.

12:25.625 --> 12:26.911
Cheerio.

12:35.750 --> 12:37.412
Oi! Come on!

12:37.542 --> 12:39.534
Mason, candles!

12:39.625 --> 12:42.459
On their way, sir.
Coming through.

12:44.042 --> 12:45.374
Oh, dear.

12:45.458 --> 12:47.165
Now, right.

12:47.792 --> 12:50.864
Let's see if we can't get some light
going down here for you, sir.

13:14.250 --> 13:15.661
Right, here we are.

13:15.792 --> 13:18.159
Out you get. Follow me.

13:39.208 --> 13:41.700
- First time, sir?
- Yes, it is.

13:43.417 --> 13:44.828
You see all this?

13:46.000 --> 13:47.707
It's poison, sir.

13:47.833 --> 13:49.870
It's the gas.

13:51.708 --> 13:53.324
See, look.

13:53.417 --> 13:55.329
All of it dead.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.582
Sorry about the smell, sir.

14:01.667 --> 14:04.250
Trench belonged to the French
before they deserted.

14:04.875 --> 14:09.199
Didn't bury the bodies, but used them to
shore up the trench walls. Poor buggers.

14:11.583 --> 14:13.165
New officer for C Company, sir.

14:13.250 --> 14:14.582
Thank you, Jarvis.

14:16.042 --> 14:17.374
Follow me, sir.

14:22.667 --> 14:25.580
Keep your head down, sir.
This bit's not fixed yet.

14:25.667 --> 14:28.410
Mind your backs, lads.
Officer coming through.

14:32.667 --> 14:34.329
Here we are, sir.

14:34.417 --> 14:35.999
Thank you, Sergeant Major.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.161
Mmm.

14:45.250 --> 14:47.788
Battalion Headquarters
told me to report here, sir.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.332
Sorry. What?

14:53.417 --> 14:56.205
Oh, I was...
I was told to report here, sir.

14:59.250 --> 15:00.582
Whisky?

15:01.417 --> 15:03.249
Yes. Just a small one. Thank you.

15:05.167 --> 15:06.453
Say when.

15:08.958 --> 15:10.449
When.

15:11.875 --> 15:13.366
- Thank you.
- Here we are.

15:22.958 --> 15:25.666
Here's to the next six days, sir.

15:28.208 --> 15:31.747
Osborne... The name's Osborne.

15:31.833 --> 15:33.620
You need only call me "sir"
in front of the men.

15:33.708 --> 15:36.496
The other officers, they call me Uncle.

15:37.458 --> 15:38.869
Raleigh. James.

15:39.958 --> 15:40.994
Jimmy.

15:41.083 --> 15:44.247
- Ever been up the line before, Jimmy?
- No. No. Uh...

15:44.917 --> 15:46.249
Only just left Barford.

15:46.375 --> 15:49.823
Barford? Really? Our company commander
lives at Barford. You know him?

15:50.000 --> 15:53.038
I do. Yes, uh, Captain Stanhope.

15:53.167 --> 15:55.409
He was my house monitor,
three years above.

15:55.542 --> 15:56.828
He used to come and stay with me

15:56.917 --> 15:59.250
and my sister Margaret in the holidays.

15:59.333 --> 16:02.701
Really?
Well, you'll find him changed, I expect.

16:02.792 --> 16:06.866
He's led this company
through all sorts of rotten times.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.832
Big strain on the man.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.992
- Yes?
- Can I lay for supper, sir?

16:12.083 --> 16:15.076
Yes, do, Mason. This is Mr Raleigh.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.995
He's just joined the company.

16:17.083 --> 16:18.995
- Good evening, sir.
- Hello.

16:19.083 --> 16:21.996
What are you tempting us
with tonight, Mason?

16:22.083 --> 16:26.202
Uh, soup, cutlets and pineapple.

16:26.333 --> 16:28.996
- Oh, pineapple? Splendid.
- Mmm.

16:29.125 --> 16:30.661
What kind of cutlets?

16:30.750 --> 16:33.914
Oh, you got me there, sir. I shouldn't
like to commit myself too deep.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.664
- Ration meat?
- Uh, ordinary ration meat, yes, sir.

16:37.750 --> 16:39.787
- But new shape.
- Oh.

16:40.583 --> 16:44.122
Smells like liver
without the smooth, wet look.

16:44.250 --> 16:46.162
Thank you, Mason.

16:46.250 --> 16:47.536
Very good, sir.

16:50.250 --> 16:51.786
New boy?

16:51.875 --> 16:53.787
Ought to have stayed at school,
poor sod.

16:53.958 --> 16:56.325
He's keen.

16:56.417 --> 16:58.875
Show me a kid out here that hasn't been.

16:58.958 --> 17:01.325
I'm keen. Keen on going home.

17:01.417 --> 17:04.740
Yeah, well, you won't be, you pillock,
except on a stretcher.

17:04.833 --> 17:07.040
So get off your arse
and wipe these plates.

17:13.458 --> 17:14.824
Fuck.

17:16.166 --> 17:17.578
Yes?

17:17.666 --> 17:19.909
- I've had an unpleasant surprise, sir.
- Yes?

17:20.125 --> 17:22.162
- The pineapples.
- What about them?

17:22.250 --> 17:25.448
- They're apricots.
- There wasn't a label on the tin?

17:25.583 --> 17:27.950
The captain'll
ring my neck, sir.

17:29.250 --> 17:31.242
Well, haven't you anything else?

17:31.417 --> 17:35.411
Well, there's the pink blancmange,
but it's not anywhere near stiff, sir.

17:35.542 --> 17:38.034
Well, we'll just have to chance it
with the apricots.

17:38.167 --> 17:39.453
Very good, sir.

17:41.042 --> 17:42.874
My stuff, should I unpack here?

17:43.042 --> 17:45.329
No, no, no. You're through there.

17:46.958 --> 17:49.200
Take a light with you, Jimmy.

17:49.333 --> 17:51.040
- Thank you.
- It's dark.

17:51.167 --> 17:53.159
- Nice meeting you, Jimmy.
- And you, sir.

17:53.417 --> 17:54.749
Uncle.

18:36.500 --> 18:39.538
When you've cleared up here, Watson,
move on further down the line.

18:39.667 --> 18:42.375
- Then get some kip.
- Thank you, sir.

18:48.292 --> 18:51.785
Foul trenches. Rusty bombs.
Damp rifle grenades.

18:51.875 --> 18:53.741
The whole place is a disgrace!

18:55.125 --> 18:57.458
This dugout smells like a cesspit.

18:57.750 --> 19:00.117
- Mason!
- Just bringing the soup, sir.

19:00.208 --> 19:02.996
- Damn the soup! Bring some whisky!
- Stanhope.

19:03.083 --> 19:06.656
Bloody Captain Hardy. Oh, if I see him,
I'll give him a piece of my mind.

19:06.917 --> 19:08.158
Stanhope.

19:11.250 --> 19:12.616
Hello, Stanhope.

19:15.250 --> 19:17.583
I was told to report
to your company, sir.

19:22.250 --> 19:25.618
Well, you said I should come
and find you if I ever join up.

19:30.792 --> 19:32.328
Sir. Evening.

19:32.417 --> 19:35.125
There's been a terrible tragedy,
Trotter.

19:35.208 --> 19:39.327
Mason's tinned pineapples, you see,
they turn out to be apricots.

19:39.417 --> 19:41.704
Mmm,
give me apricots every time.

19:41.833 --> 19:43.950
Pineapple chunks
are too bleedin' sickly.

19:44.042 --> 19:46.625
- Dinner is served.
- Mmm. Oh, good.

19:47.500 --> 19:49.583
Come along, Uncle. You sit here and...

19:50.583 --> 19:52.165
Raleigh, you better sit there.

19:59.958 --> 20:01.244
Not now.

20:06.792 --> 20:08.203
Budge over.

20:10.458 --> 20:11.824
Trotter.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.037
Raleigh. How do you do?

20:14.958 --> 20:17.450
You haven't been in the army
five minutes, have you?

20:18.417 --> 20:19.783
No. Yes. No, uh...

20:19.958 --> 20:22.621
I had eight weeks' training
at Salisbury Plain.

20:22.708 --> 20:25.906
And I was in the Corps at school.

20:26.875 --> 20:30.073
Mason, what sort of a soup is this?

20:30.167 --> 20:31.499
Yellow soup, sir.

20:31.667 --> 20:34.660
Mmm, it has a very deep yellow flavour.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.332
Pepper, Mason.

20:37.667 --> 20:39.533
I'm sorry, sir.

20:39.625 --> 20:43.619
When the, uh, mess box was packed,
the pepper was omitted.

20:43.792 --> 20:45.124
Why wasn't it packed, Mason?

20:45.250 --> 20:47.492
Oh, come on, we need pepper.

20:47.583 --> 20:49.449
It was missed, sir.

20:51.458 --> 20:53.700
Do you wanna go back upstairs
in the trench?

20:56.708 --> 20:59.667
- Turner!
- Sir.

20:59.750 --> 21:01.457
Run over to A Company
and ask Captain Willis,

21:01.542 --> 21:04.034
with my compliments,
if he can lend me a little pepper.

21:04.125 --> 21:05.457
Sir.

21:06.458 --> 21:09.951
A screw of pepper,
that's what you ask for.

21:16.083 --> 21:21.033
War's bad enough with pepper.
Without it, bleedin' awful.

21:21.125 --> 21:22.457
Hmm.

21:24.458 --> 21:26.825
Go on. Eat your soup.

21:48.292 --> 21:51.126
Hey,
I wouldn't go down that way, chum.

21:54.083 --> 21:55.449
Captain sent me.

21:59.500 --> 22:01.833
You'll get your bloody head
blown off.

22:29.958 --> 22:31.915
Jammy tosser!

22:34.667 --> 22:35.953
What's this?

22:36.917 --> 22:38.829
- Meat, sir.
- Yeah, what sort?

22:39.458 --> 22:40.824
Well, sort of a cutlet.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.117
There's cutlets
and there's cutlets, Mason.

22:43.208 --> 22:45.495
Oh, yeah. Uh, this one's a cutlet.

22:50.208 --> 22:53.701
Trotter goes back on duty
directly he's had supper.

22:54.750 --> 22:56.082
Oh, no.

22:56.167 --> 22:57.829
Now, in fact.

22:58.292 --> 22:59.954
I haven't had me apricots yet.

23:00.375 --> 23:01.741
They won't spoil.

23:05.125 --> 23:07.333
Never known nothing like a war
for upsetting meals.

23:07.417 --> 23:09.329
I'm always on call when me grub's up.

23:09.417 --> 23:11.124
Because you never stop eating.

23:14.417 --> 23:17.455
Trotter's relieving
the other platoon commander, Hibbert.

23:18.667 --> 23:20.533
You best go with him, to learn.

23:21.458 --> 23:22.790
Go and fetch your stuff.

23:23.667 --> 23:25.283
Yes, sir.

23:33.250 --> 23:34.582
Cigarette?

23:43.625 --> 23:44.866
- Come here.
- What?

23:44.958 --> 23:48.076
Tuck your respirator under your chin
like a serviette.

23:48.292 --> 23:51.205
Here you go. And you won't be needing
that stick, son.

23:52.875 --> 23:54.912
Just in case we have to run fast.

23:57.500 --> 24:01.119
Mason, don't let anyone
touch my apricots.

24:01.250 --> 24:02.616
Very good, sir.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.411
Thank you, Mason.

24:43.583 --> 24:44.949
Mr Hibbert.

24:45.458 --> 24:46.869
Mr Trotter.

24:58.792 --> 25:00.249
Got the wind up him, that one.

25:01.250 --> 25:03.116
You have to put them
in separate pockets.

25:04.458 --> 25:06.290
Green ones, business as usual.

25:06.458 --> 25:08.620
Red ones to signal an alarm.

25:10.000 --> 25:14.745
I set the wrong one off once.
Nearly cost us the war!

25:16.333 --> 25:17.699
Go on. Have a go.

25:18.625 --> 25:21.993
- Can I?
- Yeah. Yeah, go on.

25:26.833 --> 25:28.290
So just...

25:28.500 --> 25:29.832
Just up there?

25:31.125 --> 25:32.457
Whoo!

25:42.208 --> 25:43.494
Come on.

25:47.583 --> 25:48.994
That's a Lewis gun.

25:52.667 --> 25:54.283
Optimum range?

25:54.458 --> 25:56.700
That's just over a mile, Mr Trotter.

25:58.458 --> 26:01.326
- Is that them?
- Yeah.

26:09.333 --> 26:13.031
Bit of sniping on our left.

26:13.125 --> 26:16.243
One or two rifle grenades
coming over on our right.

26:16.333 --> 26:17.869
Thanks. That's good to know.

26:20.833 --> 26:23.416
Hot soup and a good chop
will put that right.

26:23.500 --> 26:26.914
Thank you. No appetite.
Pain right inside my eye.

26:30.792 --> 26:32.624
You're back on duty at 11:00.

26:33.833 --> 26:37.452
- I'll get Mason to call you.
- Right.

26:43.458 --> 26:45.620
Artful little swine.

26:46.625 --> 26:49.663
- There's no proof of neuralgia.
- Come on. He looks rotten.

26:49.750 --> 26:52.584
I may have let Warren get
away with that, but no more.

26:52.667 --> 26:54.454
No man of mine is going sick
before the attack.

26:54.542 --> 26:55.578
Shh!

26:57.708 --> 26:59.870
- Bloody little funk!
- Shh!

26:59.958 --> 27:03.281
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Keep your head down.

27:05.083 --> 27:06.619
This is the sap.

27:07.458 --> 27:09.791
Brings you to within just yards
of Jerry.

27:14.667 --> 27:15.999
Come on.

27:38.083 --> 27:39.574
Mind your nut.

27:41.083 --> 27:42.449
Now, then...

27:47.292 --> 27:51.536
It's awfully quiet,
apart from that rumble in the distance.

27:51.625 --> 27:53.833
- Troop trains.
- Germans?

27:55.083 --> 27:56.449
Them and us.

27:58.625 --> 28:00.617
All waiting for it to happen.

28:02.125 --> 28:04.412
And what about after it happens?

28:10.417 --> 28:11.703
Come on.

28:12.417 --> 28:13.703
Let's get back.

28:14.292 --> 28:16.124
Have a nice cup of tea.

28:16.208 --> 28:19.042
Raleigh tells me
he was at school with you.

28:39.625 --> 28:41.617
- Ah.
- Margaret.

28:41.708 --> 28:43.495
Oh, Raleigh's sister.

28:48.917 --> 28:50.408
She is beautiful.

28:51.875 --> 28:53.707
Is she waiting for you?

28:55.417 --> 28:59.957
She thinks I'm a wonderful chap,
commanding a company.

29:04.958 --> 29:06.995
I daren't even go back on leave.

29:08.708 --> 29:10.870
I don't want her to see how shot I am.

29:16.833 --> 29:19.291
I can't bear being fully conscious
all the time.

29:19.375 --> 29:21.332
Well, when the war's over
and the strain's gone,

29:21.417 --> 29:23.249
you'll chuck all of this muck in.

29:24.208 --> 29:26.621
He's gonna tell her
I reek of whisky all day long.

29:26.708 --> 29:28.415
Oh, God. Now, why would he?

29:30.833 --> 29:33.416
How many battalions
are there in France, Uncle?

29:34.208 --> 29:35.870
- Huh?
- Fifty divisions?

29:36.542 --> 29:39.330
Hundred and fifty brigades.
Four hundred and fifty battalions.

29:39.417 --> 29:42.034
- That's 1,800 companies.
- All right.

29:42.125 --> 29:43.866
- Why this one?
- That's it. Come on.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.323
- Why now?
- Come on. Come to bed.

29:48.792 --> 29:51.910
Come on. There you go.

29:52.500 --> 29:54.162
Come on.

29:54.250 --> 29:55.616
All right.

29:58.583 --> 30:00.290
There. There we are.

30:06.625 --> 30:08.617
You go to sleep.

30:08.708 --> 30:10.324
Go to sleep yourself.

30:10.500 --> 30:13.698
I'll have you woken at 4:00, all right?

30:13.833 --> 30:15.745
- Tuck me in, Uncle.
- There we are.

30:15.833 --> 30:17.074
What? What?

30:17.250 --> 30:19.242
- Kiss me.
- Oh, stop it!

30:19.333 --> 30:21.620
Your hands are cold.

30:31.625 --> 30:33.036
Bless you.

30:34.667 --> 30:35.999
Just sleep.

30:37.458 --> 30:38.824
Sleep.

31:39.167 --> 31:40.624
Good night, lad.

31:43.042 --> 31:44.499
Good night, Mr Trotter.

33:43.500 --> 33:44.911
All good, men.

33:49.500 --> 33:52.038
Knockity knees, Evans.

33:52.125 --> 33:53.661
It's me elbows now, sir.

33:53.792 --> 33:55.499
Just need a bit of greasing.

33:57.458 --> 33:58.824
Anyone seen a skylark?

33:58.917 --> 34:00.579
They're all up at Wipers, sir,

34:00.667 --> 34:02.033
crapping on the French.

34:02.208 --> 34:04.825
- Sir.
- Yeah.

34:04.917 --> 34:06.283
CO wants to see you, sir.

34:06.458 --> 34:07.790
What, now?

34:07.875 --> 34:09.286
Yes, now, sir.

34:12.583 --> 34:15.041
Tell Mr Raleigh to step up,
Sergeant Major.

34:15.167 --> 34:16.533
Yes, sir.

34:37.875 --> 34:39.241
Yes, sir.

34:39.333 --> 34:41.074
I'll put you through.

34:41.208 --> 34:42.995
- Good morning, Stanhope.
- Sir.

34:43.083 --> 34:44.449
Take a pew.

34:48.833 --> 34:50.949
D Company's German deserter.

34:51.042 --> 34:52.998
He says the attack's coming the 21st.

34:54.917 --> 34:57.125
Thursday. Day after tomorrow.

34:57.250 --> 35:00.288
Once it does come, we can't expect
much support from behind.

35:01.042 --> 35:02.783
No reinforcements, sir?

35:02.875 --> 35:05.458
You're to stay where you are for
as long as you can. Slow them down.

35:05.542 --> 35:06.703
As long as we can, sir?

35:06.792 --> 35:09.990
Our orders are to stay put.
Let them come to us.

35:11.958 --> 35:13.574
And that's it, sir?

35:13.708 --> 35:15.415
That's it.

35:16.625 --> 35:17.957
Cheerio, Stanhope.

35:21.458 --> 35:22.790
Cheerio, sir.

35:27.875 --> 35:29.958
- Send in Captain Willis, will you?
- Sir.

35:31.333 --> 35:32.699
Captain Willis.

35:39.542 --> 35:41.329
Stand down!

35:43.583 --> 35:45.040
Stand down!

35:46.625 --> 35:47.991
Stand down!

35:50.292 --> 35:52.875
Well done, men. Well done, Evans.

36:03.125 --> 36:04.582
- There you go, sir.
- Right.

36:04.875 --> 36:06.787
Uh, thank you, Turner.

36:10.208 --> 36:12.165
Need me to teach you how to shave, lad?

36:18.917 --> 36:20.658
Can you smell that? Eh?

36:21.708 --> 36:24.496
Nothing like a fat rasher of bacon
when you're famished.

36:26.542 --> 36:28.283
- Come on, Mr Raleigh.
- Right.

36:28.417 --> 36:30.204
Bacon, Mason!

36:31.125 --> 36:32.616
- Bread, sir.
- Thank you.

36:32.708 --> 36:35.291
- Pass the jam, please, Raleigh.
- It's strawberry.

36:35.375 --> 36:37.492
- Mmm.
- There you go.

36:37.625 --> 36:39.912
Glad we polished off the raspberry.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.458
All the pips were getting stuck
behind me plate.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.162
That's me. I'm done.

36:50.500 --> 36:52.287
Cheery soul.

36:52.458 --> 36:53.744
Mmm.

36:55.792 --> 36:58.705
You know, I feel like
I've been here ages

36:58.792 --> 37:00.624
and we've still another five days to go.

37:03.417 --> 37:05.625
It's funny to think of the Boche
being so close.

37:05.708 --> 37:08.826
Yes.
About the width of a rugby field.

37:09.083 --> 37:10.949
- What, do you play?
- No.

37:11.042 --> 37:12.533
Well, I used to.

37:13.042 --> 37:15.876
Mostly reffing at school
these last few years.

37:15.958 --> 37:17.494
You were a schoolmaster?

37:19.750 --> 37:21.286
I don't mind schoolmasters.

37:24.250 --> 37:26.287
I used to play for the Harlequins.

37:26.375 --> 37:29.743
- No!
- Mmm. And England on one occasion.

37:29.875 --> 37:31.116
You played for England?

37:31.292 --> 37:34.706
Shh. It was a long time ago.
Don't breeze about it.

37:34.792 --> 37:36.283
Don't any of the others know?

37:38.250 --> 37:40.458
Doesn't really make
much difference out here.

37:44.458 --> 37:47.041
Well, I should write a letter
to my sister.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.582
This coming Thursday.

38:17.375 --> 38:19.082
- The 21st?
- Mmm-hmm.

38:21.500 --> 38:23.412
My birthday's on the 22nd.

38:25.958 --> 38:28.245
I'm sure the Boche
have taken that into account.

38:29.333 --> 38:31.165
Well, all me parcels will be delayed.

38:32.667 --> 38:34.784
That's if anyone
still loves you, Trotter.

39:01.083 --> 39:03.871
Sergeant Major's got the men
preparing the wire.

39:03.958 --> 39:05.574
When they've done all along the front,

39:05.667 --> 39:08.125
I want them putting a belt
down both sides.

39:10.208 --> 39:11.369
Both sides?

39:11.458 --> 39:12.915
If this attack comes,

39:13.000 --> 39:16.198
I'm not going to trust A and B Companies
to hold their ground on either flank.

39:16.292 --> 39:17.533
Right.

39:18.792 --> 39:20.829
- When's it expected?
- Thursday.

39:23.750 --> 39:25.082
Huh.

39:26.583 --> 39:27.915
It's odd.

39:28.667 --> 39:30.624
I'm glad it's coming, at last.

39:31.458 --> 39:32.915
Sick of waiting.

39:33.833 --> 39:35.415
We'll get no help from behind.

39:36.667 --> 39:38.329
We're not to budge.

39:38.458 --> 39:39.790
I see.

39:41.375 --> 39:42.707
Yes?

39:44.542 --> 39:47.865
- Perhaps you'd like some sardines, sir?
- I should loathe it.

39:49.167 --> 39:50.624
Very good.

40:06.250 --> 40:07.866
Day after tomorrow.

40:13.833 --> 40:15.540
Fuck.

40:34.958 --> 40:36.449
Stanhope?

40:40.292 --> 40:41.954
Mason?

40:58.750 --> 41:00.457
Bit early, but it's damn cold.

41:09.583 --> 41:11.825
See any shows
when you were last on leave?

41:11.917 --> 41:13.954
Uh, well, wish I had now.

41:14.125 --> 41:17.664
Spent all of my time in the garden
working on the rockery.

41:18.542 --> 41:20.750
Your wife must have been thrilled.

41:20.833 --> 41:23.541
Well, Joan and I and the boys

41:24.833 --> 41:26.745
pretended there wasn't a war on.

41:28.333 --> 41:29.699
It was great.

41:38.958 --> 41:42.122
I'm going to inspect my rifles now.
Where shall we put letters?

41:42.292 --> 41:45.000
Oh, just put it on the table
for the quartermaster.

41:46.417 --> 41:47.749
Leave it open.

41:49.292 --> 41:51.875
I have to censor all letters.
It's the rule.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.491
Give me that letter.

42:04.708 --> 42:07.451
- It's private.
- Do you understand an order?

42:18.958 --> 42:20.915
Now go and inspect your rifles.

42:22.875 --> 42:24.286
Sir.

42:27.958 --> 42:30.075
Do you know what?
I'll join you.

42:30.958 --> 42:34.372
- For God's sake, Stanhope.
- Osborne, I'm commanding this company.

42:34.458 --> 42:36.370
You cannot read his letters!

42:37.292 --> 42:39.454
- Well, then you read it.
- I don't want to.

42:55.167 --> 42:56.749
Oh, it's nothing.

42:56.917 --> 43:00.740
It just describes how he got here.
No place names. All the usual stuff.

43:01.042 --> 43:02.453
Read it.

43:03.167 --> 43:04.533
All right.

43:06.750 --> 43:09.493
"I was taken along some trenches
and reported to C Company.

43:09.583 --> 43:13.076
"A nice officer greeted me.
Older. Second in command.

43:13.167 --> 43:16.740
"And then there he was,
Captain Stanhope, MC.

43:16.833 --> 43:18.165
"Tired because he works so hard,

43:18.250 --> 43:20.867
- "because of all the responsibility."
- That's enough.

43:20.958 --> 43:22.620
"The other officers told me
all about him,

43:22.708 --> 43:24.916
"the finest officer
in the whole battalion."

43:25.000 --> 43:27.492
Would you like me to seal this now?

43:46.333 --> 43:49.371
Excuse me, sir. CO needs
to see you at HQ, sir. Right away.

44:01.458 --> 44:03.370
I can smell the whisky on you, Stanhope.

44:07.042 --> 44:08.328
You need to steady on.

44:08.500 --> 44:10.332
Will that be all, sir?

44:13.958 --> 44:15.870
The brigadier's been to see me.

44:16.542 --> 44:18.659
He wants us to make a raid,

44:18.750 --> 44:21.458
to find out how many
have come into the line opposite.

44:21.542 --> 44:23.659
- When?
- Tonight.

44:23.750 --> 44:25.286
- That's absurd.
- It is.

44:25.875 --> 44:27.366
Which is what I told the brigadier.

44:27.458 --> 44:29.290
So he's agreed to
tomorrow afternoon instead.

44:29.375 --> 44:30.411
Afternoon?

44:30.500 --> 44:33.243
A surprise daylight raid
under a smokescreen.

44:33.375 --> 44:34.786
Two officers. Ten men.

44:34.875 --> 44:37.117
Tonight we'll mortar some holes
in the Boche wire

44:37.208 --> 44:38.870
and cut some holes in our own.

44:39.292 --> 44:42.581
Harrison from trench and mortars
is coming for dinner at 8:00. Join us.

44:42.667 --> 44:44.249
Very well, sir.

44:44.833 --> 44:46.916
I want one officer to direct the raid

44:47.000 --> 44:50.368
and one to make the dash in
to collar some Boche.

44:50.458 --> 44:53.326
- Do you want me to go with them, sir?
- No, I can't let you go.

44:53.417 --> 44:55.033
Well, whom do you suggest, sir?

44:55.125 --> 44:58.539
Osborne. He's level-headed.
He can direct the raid.

44:58.625 --> 44:59.957
Who else?

45:00.042 --> 45:02.204
Well, Trotter can't cut a dash. Hibbert?

45:02.292 --> 45:03.328
I don't think so.

45:04.042 --> 45:07.206
- Why not send a good sergeant, sir?
- The men expect officers to lead a raid.

45:08.167 --> 45:10.284
How about that youngster
sent up to you last night?

45:10.458 --> 45:13.781
- He's a bit new to it all.
- All to the good. His nerves are steady.

45:13.875 --> 45:16.492
- He's only just arrived, sir.
- Well, who else is there?

45:26.417 --> 45:27.908
Do you like fish?

45:29.042 --> 45:30.249
Fish, sir?

45:30.333 --> 45:33.326
We're having some fish
sent up fresh from railhead for supper.

45:34.833 --> 45:36.119
Carry on.

46:06.292 --> 46:08.579
No need to worry
about the wood, Mr Raleigh.

46:08.667 --> 46:12.035
Just the bolt, magazine and barrel.

46:14.750 --> 46:16.082
Take over.

46:16.750 --> 46:18.036
Right.

46:20.667 --> 46:22.158
Clean as a whistle, Private.

46:25.625 --> 46:26.957
Marvellous.

46:37.000 --> 46:40.072
I'm afraid I can't stick it any longer.

46:41.500 --> 46:44.914
Rotten, isn't it? I've got it like hell.

46:45.125 --> 46:46.366
Really?

46:46.458 --> 46:47.744
Had it for weeks.

46:48.708 --> 46:51.166
Well, I'm sorry,
but I need to go down.

46:51.250 --> 46:53.913
I need to go to the hospital, I need
to get some sort of treatment.

46:54.167 --> 46:56.625
- You're staying here.
- I'm going to see the doctor.

46:56.708 --> 46:58.574
He'll only send you back.
Save yourself the walk.

46:58.667 --> 47:01.034
But I have a right to go sick.

47:01.125 --> 47:03.287
If the men can, why can't I?

47:03.375 --> 47:04.616
You're going to stay here

47:04.708 --> 47:07.246
and you're gonna see it through
with the rest of us.

47:08.167 --> 47:09.908
The pain's driving me mad.

47:11.667 --> 47:13.624
You can't stop me.

47:14.875 --> 47:16.241
Get off!

47:18.833 --> 47:20.199
Sit!

47:23.583 --> 47:24.915
Stay!

47:27.625 --> 47:32.040
I could have you shot for desertion,
but I'd rather spare you that disgrace.

47:35.875 --> 47:37.832
- You wouldn't dare.
- Oh, really?

47:37.917 --> 47:40.159
I'll give you half a minute to find out.

47:49.708 --> 47:51.074
Twenty seconds.

47:55.125 --> 47:56.787
Ten.

48:00.875 --> 48:02.662
Five.

48:28.792 --> 48:29.953
All right.

48:33.750 --> 48:35.457
OK. All right.

48:39.667 --> 48:40.953
Shh.

48:55.500 --> 48:57.537
I am never going up those steps.

48:59.458 --> 49:01.040
The men looking at me.

49:02.125 --> 49:03.582
Knowing.

49:04.917 --> 49:06.533
I'd rather die here.

49:08.708 --> 49:10.199
Please.

49:12.625 --> 49:14.366
I know how you feel.

49:14.458 --> 49:16.324
How can you know?

49:16.417 --> 49:18.784
Because I feel exactly the same.

49:24.958 --> 49:27.951
Every little noise up there
makes me feel sick.

49:28.042 --> 49:29.624
I loathe it.

49:31.000 --> 49:34.744
Sometimes I wish I could just get
into bed and pretend I'm paralysed.

49:37.542 --> 49:40.250
Just lie there until I die.

49:41.417 --> 49:43.079
What does it matter?

49:45.708 --> 49:48.041
They have sent us here to die.

49:50.208 --> 49:51.915
Suppose you are knocked out?

49:54.292 --> 49:56.579
You won't have
to bear this hell any more.

50:01.875 --> 50:06.040
But don't you think it's worth
standing in with men like Osborne?

50:07.542 --> 50:08.828
Trotter?

50:13.833 --> 50:15.790
They all feel like we do.

50:15.875 --> 50:17.411
They do.

50:17.500 --> 50:19.537
But they stick at it.

50:20.542 --> 50:22.750
It's the only thing a decent man can do.

50:35.333 --> 50:39.282
You won't tell anyone
how much of a funk I am, will you?

50:43.167 --> 50:44.499
I won't if you won't.

50:45.000 --> 50:46.457
Good man.

50:49.292 --> 50:53.536
Have 10 minutes. We'll go in together.
We'll hold each other's hand.

50:55.500 --> 50:57.708
Jump every time a rat squeaks.

51:04.417 --> 51:06.750
I mean to come through this, Hibbert,
don't you?

51:09.542 --> 51:10.828
Yes, sir.

51:15.042 --> 51:19.161
Sir, can I make you some nice, hot tea?

51:19.250 --> 51:22.209
Can you guarantee it's nice?

51:22.292 --> 51:25.535
Well, to be honest, uh,
it is a little oniony, sir.

51:25.625 --> 51:27.332
Ah.

51:27.417 --> 51:30.034
All right, Mason, two cups of onion tea
and bread and jam.

51:30.625 --> 51:32.241
Coming right up, sir.

51:48.250 --> 51:50.162
Excuse me.

51:50.250 --> 51:51.991
We've got to make a raid, Uncle.

51:53.333 --> 51:56.781
Tomorrow afternoon under a smokescreen.
Two officers, ten men.

51:59.250 --> 52:00.616
Who's going?

52:01.625 --> 52:03.708
- You.
- Ah.

52:05.750 --> 52:07.036
And Raleigh.

52:09.042 --> 52:12.581
- Why Raleigh?
- You to direct. Raleigh to dash in.

52:14.625 --> 52:15.957
Ah.

52:17.667 --> 52:19.954
- You want me to tell him?
- I'll tell him.

52:23.708 --> 52:25.370
- Tomorrow?
- Mmm-hmm.

52:26.333 --> 52:28.245
- What time?
- 5:00.

52:29.375 --> 52:30.707
5:00.

52:31.833 --> 52:33.369
Cheer up, skipper.

52:34.292 --> 52:36.625
We've got to make a raid
tomorrow afternoon.

52:37.708 --> 52:38.994
What, all of us?

52:39.083 --> 52:42.576
No, just me, Raleigh and 10 of the boys.

52:42.708 --> 52:44.620
- Raleigh?
- Excuse me, sir.

52:44.708 --> 52:45.994
But he only just got here.

52:47.458 --> 52:48.915
- And you, too?
- Me, too.

52:50.833 --> 52:52.165
What a nuisance.

52:53.583 --> 52:54.994
Yes, that's what I thought.

53:04.792 --> 53:06.328
Mr Hibbert.

53:13.167 --> 53:14.453
Ready?

53:15.500 --> 53:16.786
- Ready.
- Good man.

53:28.750 --> 53:30.161
Have you told them?

53:31.125 --> 53:32.457
Yes.

53:33.167 --> 53:34.749
Osborne took it on the chin.

53:36.500 --> 53:39.163
- Raleigh thought it was exciting.
- Good fellow.

53:40.625 --> 53:42.992
I know this is hard on the men,
Stanhope,

53:43.083 --> 53:45.917
so I pulled a few strings
with the quartermaster.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.333
And I've thrown in
a few goodies of my own.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.663
- Thank you, sir.
- Well, it's the least I could do.

53:56.792 --> 53:58.203
Bang on time.

54:00.583 --> 54:03.246
Don't you need to see for yourself
that they've done the job, Harrison?

54:03.333 --> 54:06.952
Delegation, Stanhope.
They always hit their coordinates.

54:07.042 --> 54:08.203
Well, nine times out of ten.

54:15.667 --> 54:17.283
Thank you.

54:17.375 --> 54:18.741
Gentlemen,

54:19.833 --> 54:21.290
to C Company.

54:21.375 --> 54:23.241
To C Company.

54:23.667 --> 54:25.158
C Company.

54:28.667 --> 54:31.410
Shit.
Rations from the Colonel coming through.

54:31.542 --> 54:33.784
- Oi!
- Excuse me, lads.

54:33.875 --> 54:37.039
Fucking hell. Sorry. Cheers.

54:37.125 --> 54:38.707
Rations and post here.

54:38.792 --> 54:41.956
Fuck. Shit.

54:42.625 --> 54:44.036
Watch your backs, lads.

54:44.125 --> 54:46.037
Rations and post here.

54:46.125 --> 54:48.913
Fucking chickens. Bollocks.

54:49.042 --> 54:51.329
Sorry. Coming through.

54:51.417 --> 54:54.285
Shit. Sorry. Excuse me. Thank you.

54:56.583 --> 54:57.915
Sir.

55:01.083 --> 55:03.166
- Good morning, Jarvis.
- Morning, sir.

55:03.750 --> 55:05.207
Watch your backs, lads.

55:08.875 --> 55:10.662
Here he is.

55:11.625 --> 55:13.662
All right, Jarvis?

55:14.542 --> 55:16.534
- Cup of tea?
- Yes, please.

55:18.583 --> 55:19.994
Well, Bert,

55:22.375 --> 55:23.786
you know what to do.

55:33.875 --> 55:36.663
This waiting's like being summoned
to the headmaster.

55:36.750 --> 55:37.831
Yeah.

55:37.917 --> 55:40.705
I didn't think
I'd have that feeling again.

56:01.000 --> 56:04.573
The plan was to blow
a dozen holes in different places, sir.

56:04.667 --> 56:06.954
It took three hours
to blow that one.

56:09.750 --> 56:14.541
We must make a surprise raid
farther up the line. After dark.

56:14.625 --> 56:17.038
Yes, I suggested that,
but the brigadier was adamant

56:17.125 --> 56:18.787
that present arrangements would stand.

56:18.875 --> 56:21.618
Damn it! The Germans will have
a dozen machine guns

56:21.708 --> 56:23.415
trained on our bloody great gaping hole!

56:23.500 --> 56:25.583
Now, listen here, Stanhope.

56:25.667 --> 56:28.205
My report's to be at Headquarters
by 7:00 this evening.

56:28.292 --> 56:30.659
- If we wait till dark it'll be too late.
- Why 7:00?

56:30.792 --> 56:33.785
Some conference with Army Service Corps.

56:35.042 --> 56:36.704
Dinner at 8:00, you mean.

56:38.458 --> 56:41.656
HQ need as much information as possible,
as early as possible.

56:42.458 --> 56:44.165
That's why we can't wait
until after dark.

56:44.250 --> 56:45.286
Can't we?

56:45.375 --> 56:48.994
Those are the orders.
It's only 60 yards or so.

56:49.083 --> 56:51.496
- Hmm.
- The smoke ought to cover you nicely.

56:53.708 --> 56:55.665
If I could cancel it, Stanhope, I would.

56:57.250 --> 56:58.912
Of course you would, sir.

57:19.917 --> 57:22.034
- Roberts. Enjoying the sun?
- Mmm.

57:22.125 --> 57:23.741
<i>"My darling Joan.</i>

57:25.167 --> 57:27.750
<i>"When you read this,
I don't imagine that for one moment</i>

57:27.875 --> 57:30.208
<i>"you'll feel bitter or resentful."</i>

57:30.958 --> 57:32.415
- Morning, Wilkins.
- Sir.

57:33.125 --> 57:35.742
<i>"But you will find no comfort
in the thought</i>

57:35.875 --> 57:37.867
<i>"that I went down
fighting for my country.</i>

57:38.833 --> 57:41.416
<i>"You are too clear-headed for that,
my darling."</i>

57:43.083 --> 57:44.449
- Peters.
- Sir.

57:44.542 --> 57:45.658
- Evans.
- Sir.

57:45.750 --> 57:47.491
<i>"There is a job to be done.</i>

57:47.708 --> 57:50.291
<i>"It ought never to have arisen,
but that is not the point."</i>

57:50.417 --> 57:51.874
- Hello, lads.
- Sir.

57:52.042 --> 57:55.661
<i>"I have had so very much out of life,</i>

57:55.792 --> 57:59.536
<i>"but all these youngsters
do not realise how unlucky they are,</i>

57:59.625 --> 58:02.288
<i>"so new are they
to their very existence."</i>

58:27.042 --> 58:28.499
Evans.

58:33.208 --> 58:34.540
White.

58:36.833 --> 58:38.290
Peters.

58:39.458 --> 58:40.824
Smith.

58:42.125 --> 58:43.787
Watson.

58:43.875 --> 58:45.332
Wiggins.

58:48.292 --> 58:49.783
Taylor.

58:50.625 --> 58:52.036
Draycott.

58:53.708 --> 58:55.495
Stafford.

58:55.625 --> 58:58.083
And Hawkins.

59:06.542 --> 59:07.874
See ya, mate.

59:13.083 --> 59:14.540
Good luck, pal.

59:27.500 --> 59:29.332
Everything ready, Osborne?

59:29.458 --> 59:30.994
Yes, I think we're ready, sir.

59:31.125 --> 59:33.663
The smoke bombs
will drop exactly on the hour.

59:34.292 --> 59:36.784
You'll give the word to go
when the smoke is thick enough.

59:36.958 --> 59:38.290
Will do, sir.

59:38.667 --> 59:40.078
Men had their rum, Uncle?

59:40.292 --> 59:42.534
Sergeant Major is seeing to it now, sir.

59:44.792 --> 59:46.784
Would you like to speak to the men, sir?

59:49.542 --> 59:51.204
Don't you think they'd rather
be left alone?

59:51.292 --> 59:54.080
I think they'd appreciate
a word or two from you, sir.

59:55.917 --> 59:57.453
If you think they would.

01:00:00.708 --> 01:00:02.119
- Good luck, Osborne.
- Thank you, sir.

01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:03.866
I'm sure you'll put up a good show.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.366
- And you, Raleigh.
- Sir.

01:00:05.458 --> 01:00:07.916
Just go in like blazes, grab hold
of the first Boche you see

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.036
and bundle him across.

01:00:09.125 --> 01:00:12.448
- Yes, sir.
- Bring us a spare if you see one handy.

01:00:13.208 --> 01:00:15.951
A great deal depends
on you bringing in a German.

01:00:16.083 --> 01:00:17.449
You never know,

01:00:18.708 --> 01:00:20.540
it may win us the war.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.414
- Stanhope...
- Be up in a minute, sir.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.707
The ring is for Johnny.

01:00:40.167 --> 01:00:42.375
The watch should go to Richard.

01:00:42.750 --> 01:00:45.163
And this is for Joan.

01:00:46.667 --> 01:00:48.033
You're coming back.

01:00:48.917 --> 01:00:51.159
- Take it.
- What should I do without you?

01:00:52.667 --> 01:00:53.999
Please.

01:00:56.208 --> 01:00:58.621
I'll see you up by the sap
before the off.

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.867
Oh, damn you, Colonel.

01:01:32.875 --> 01:01:34.207
Eight minutes.

01:01:37.125 --> 01:01:38.832
Time for one small pipe.

01:01:41.667 --> 01:01:43.499
Oh, and thank you, Mason.

01:01:57.208 --> 01:01:58.870
Best for them not to see our rank.

01:02:00.083 --> 01:02:02.245
Right. Yes.

01:02:02.417 --> 01:02:06.707
And you might want
to turn out your pockets, too.

01:02:14.542 --> 01:02:16.750
Like some rum in your coffee?

01:02:16.875 --> 01:02:19.913
Well, it might make us a bit muzzy.

01:02:20.042 --> 01:02:21.658
Yes.

01:02:21.833 --> 01:02:24.541
Well, we'll have it
when we get back, to celebrate.

01:02:25.542 --> 01:02:26.908
Good idea.

01:02:33.458 --> 01:02:36.747
- I wish we could start now.
- Seven minutes yet. All right...

01:02:37.667 --> 01:02:39.499
Take a last look at this map.

01:02:41.875 --> 01:02:45.368
All right. It's very simple.
When the smoke's thick enough,

01:02:45.458 --> 01:02:46.915
we're gonna run across
to this point here.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.617
You'll jump into the trench,
grab the first German you see.

01:02:49.708 --> 01:02:51.495
I'll blow my whistle
and we'll run back like the blazes.

01:02:51.583 --> 01:02:53.950
The whole thing'll be over
in under three minutes.

01:02:54.042 --> 01:02:55.408
- As quick as that?
- Quick as that.

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:59.119
Now, let's forget about it
for the next six minutes.

01:03:00.958 --> 01:03:03.075
- I don't think I can.
- Well, you must.

01:03:03.167 --> 01:03:05.409
- Is your coffee sweet enough?
- Yes.

01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:08.867
These smoke bombs,
do they make much of a row...

01:03:08.958 --> 01:03:12.656
- Do you prefer coffee to tea?
- For breakfast.

01:03:13.708 --> 01:03:14.915
I wonder what the Boche are doing out...

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.287
Personally, I prefer cocoa
for breakfast.

01:03:18.458 --> 01:03:20.700
- I'm sorry.
- Why shouldn't I prefer cocoa?

01:03:20.792 --> 01:03:22.624
No, I keep talking...

01:03:22.708 --> 01:03:24.199
It's all right.

01:03:24.333 --> 01:03:26.700
- Will they retaliate in any way?
- Bound to.

01:03:26.917 --> 01:03:29.830
- Shelling?
- "The time has come," the walrus said,

01:03:29.917 --> 01:03:31.579
"to talk of many things,

01:03:31.667 --> 01:03:36.082
"of shoes and ships and sealing wax,
of cabbages and kings."

01:03:36.167 --> 01:03:39.080
- "And why the sea is boiling hot..."
- Yes.

01:03:39.167 --> 01:03:42.239
- "And whether pigs have wings."
- Good. Black pigs or white pigs?

01:03:42.417 --> 01:03:43.749
- Black pigs.
- Why?

01:03:43.833 --> 01:03:46.621
- They run all over the New Forest.
- You know the New Forest?

01:03:46.708 --> 01:03:49.951
My home's there. Allum Green.
It's just outside Lyndhurst.

01:03:50.042 --> 01:03:52.534
I know Lyndhurst.
I used to walk through the forest

01:03:52.625 --> 01:03:54.287
with my rucksack and sandwiches.

01:03:54.375 --> 01:03:56.492
I like it better than any place I know.

01:03:56.583 --> 01:04:02.079
Stanhope and my sister and I would
spend days and days walking the forest.

01:04:02.167 --> 01:04:04.284
You should come stay with us sometime.

01:04:06.083 --> 01:04:08.746
Yes, I should like that very much.

01:04:08.833 --> 01:04:11.291
I'll show you places
that nobody knows about,

01:04:11.375 --> 01:04:15.619
where the forest gets much darker
and thicker, cooler.

01:04:15.708 --> 01:04:19.031
You know, where I live in Sussex,

01:04:19.125 --> 01:04:21.663
there's a Roman road called Stane Street

01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:23.958
and it runs straight as a line,

01:04:24.042 --> 01:04:26.659
all the way from the coast to London.

01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:29.993
And near my house,
the old road runs over Bignor Hill.

01:04:30.083 --> 01:04:32.450
The new road's been cut
around the base of the hill.

01:04:32.542 --> 01:04:35.455
The old road hasn't been used
for donkey's years,

01:04:35.542 --> 01:04:40.116
and it's all overgrown
with grass and bushes and trees

01:04:40.208 --> 01:04:42.450
growing right in the middle of it.

01:04:49.292 --> 01:04:50.373
Oh, I just took all of that off

01:04:50.458 --> 01:04:52.666
because I didn't wanna run the risk
of losing it.

01:04:58.458 --> 01:05:00.415
All right, we'd better get ready.

01:05:01.292 --> 01:05:02.703
Yes.

01:05:03.250 --> 01:05:04.912
I'm not gonna wear my belt.

01:05:05.958 --> 01:05:07.745
I'll just take my revolver.

01:05:09.208 --> 01:05:11.666
I feel so much better
with this in my hand, don't you?

01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:14.663
Mmm, something to hold on to.
Loaded all right?

01:05:15.833 --> 01:05:17.199
Yes.

01:05:19.542 --> 01:05:21.955
I do hate leaving it
with a nice glow on top.

01:05:23.125 --> 01:05:24.787
Three minutes. We'd better go.

01:05:24.875 --> 01:05:26.616
Listen, Raleigh.

01:05:28.375 --> 01:05:30.662
I'm so glad it's you and me together.

01:05:32.083 --> 01:05:33.494
So am I.

01:05:34.958 --> 01:05:36.494
We'll put up a good show.

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:39.207
Yes, we will.

01:05:41.167 --> 01:05:43.625
- Good luck, sir.
- All right.

01:05:46.042 --> 01:05:49.114
Good luck, Mr Raleigh, sir.

01:05:51.042 --> 01:05:52.408
Thank you, Mason.

01:06:07.208 --> 01:06:10.076
- Good luck, sir.
- Thank you. Thank you, Jenkins.

01:06:12.333 --> 01:06:14.996
- All the best, sir.
- Thank you.

01:06:15.083 --> 01:06:16.824
- You show 'em, sir.
- Thank you.

01:06:16.917 --> 01:06:18.408
Come back safe, sir.

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:20.583
Thank you, Andrews. And sound.

01:06:22.542 --> 01:06:25.455
- Hello, lads.
- Best of luck, sir.

01:06:25.542 --> 01:06:27.283
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

01:06:27.375 --> 01:06:28.536
Come back safe, sir.

01:06:29.208 --> 01:06:30.790
- Good luck, sir.
- Thank you.

01:06:30.875 --> 01:06:32.491
- Stay safe, sir.
- Thank you.

01:06:34.250 --> 01:06:35.286
Give 'em hell, sir.

01:06:35.375 --> 01:06:37.583
Do my best.
At least the weather held.

01:06:39.667 --> 01:06:40.999
Boys.

01:06:43.583 --> 01:06:45.745
- Stay safe, sir.
- Thank you.

01:06:47.458 --> 01:06:48.994
Good luck, sir.

01:07:05.875 --> 01:07:07.286
Eyes to the right.

01:07:08.208 --> 01:07:11.451
Better than pissing yourself over there,
sir, if you'll pardon the French.

01:07:11.917 --> 01:07:13.249
Right.

01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:56.911
Time to go.

01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:58.911
Right.

01:08:11.292 --> 01:08:13.534
Bring us back a helmet, Mr Raleigh.

01:08:13.625 --> 01:08:15.958
With a German inside.

01:08:20.707 --> 01:08:22.825
Show 'em what C Company are made of.

01:08:22.917 --> 01:08:24.453
Do you proud, sir.

01:08:27.082 --> 01:08:28.540
Stay low.

01:08:29.792 --> 01:08:31.374
Eyes forward. Don't look back.

01:08:31.957 --> 01:08:33.415
And bumps-a-daisy, sir.

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:34.786
Precisely.

01:08:38.082 --> 01:08:39.493
Down, get down.

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:43.241
I'll save you some chocolate.

01:08:43.332 --> 01:08:45.871
- Very kind of you, sir.
- Just keep your head down.

01:09:30.457 --> 01:09:31.823
All right.

01:09:32.667 --> 01:09:33.908
Look at me.

01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:09.207
All right, chaps.

01:10:10.833 --> 01:10:12.415
Right! Come on!

01:10:21.083 --> 01:10:22.619
Keep going! Keep going!

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:25.366
Keep your heads!

01:10:26.458 --> 01:10:28.871
Stay together!

01:10:35.667 --> 01:10:37.329
Come on! Catch up!

01:10:43.083 --> 01:10:44.619
Here you are, sir.

01:10:49.792 --> 01:10:52.034
Keep your heads!
Keep your heads!

01:10:57.667 --> 01:11:00.330
Come on! Get in there!

01:11:01.708 --> 01:11:03.495
Come on! Come on!

01:11:08.708 --> 01:11:10.700
Pull him out!

01:11:19.542 --> 01:11:21.158
Get him up!

01:11:38.208 --> 01:11:39.619
Watson!

01:11:39.708 --> 01:11:41.870
Raleigh, go!

01:11:42.833 --> 01:11:44.495
Come on!

01:11:54.208 --> 01:11:55.790
Come on!

01:11:59.625 --> 01:12:02.288
They're coming, sir.
Here they come.

01:12:03.625 --> 01:12:05.833
- Be ready!
- Get ready, lads!

01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:11.074
Get ready! Let's go!

01:12:14.125 --> 01:12:16.037
- Watson, sir!
- Watson!

01:12:16.125 --> 01:12:17.661
- Evans, sir.
- Stevens!

01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:19.707
That's three.

01:12:21.292 --> 01:12:24.251
Go! Go, go! Go, go!

01:12:24.333 --> 01:12:26.950
- Anyone else?
- Not yet, sir.

01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:32.207
Come on. Come on.

01:12:32.292 --> 01:12:33.703
Sergeant Major! Anyone?

01:12:33.792 --> 01:12:36.409
I can't see. Smoke's too thick, sir!

01:12:47.333 --> 01:12:48.915
Sit him down.

01:12:54.583 --> 01:12:57.166
<i>- Nein!</i>
- Stop that!

01:13:02.167 --> 01:13:03.954
Give him back his other things.

01:13:33.833 --> 01:13:37.122
We've got everything
we wanted. 20th WÃ¼rttembergisches.

01:13:37.875 --> 01:13:40.288
The regiment came
into the line last night.

01:13:40.417 --> 01:13:43.660
They're packing them in here now.
The brigadier will be pleased.

01:13:44.583 --> 01:13:47.246
How nice that the brigadier
will be pleased.

01:13:48.875 --> 01:13:50.286
How many made it back?

01:13:50.417 --> 01:13:52.875
How many did you expect to make it back?

01:13:56.833 --> 01:14:00.873
Four men, one officer
made it safely back.

01:14:05.417 --> 01:14:08.455
Raleigh.
You've done very well, Raleigh.

01:14:09.333 --> 01:14:11.199
You deserve a Military Cross for this.

01:14:16.417 --> 01:14:17.749
Carry on.

01:14:25.208 --> 01:14:27.291
Must you sit on his bed?

01:15:06.458 --> 01:15:08.745
And then I picked up
a couple of tarts

01:15:08.875 --> 01:15:11.242
- and took them out to dinner.
- Here we go.

01:15:11.333 --> 01:15:13.290
Must have drank enough bubbly
to sink a battleship.

01:15:13.375 --> 01:15:15.537
Float.
It's "float a battleship".

01:15:15.625 --> 01:15:19.118
Float a battleship, and then I took them
for a spin out to Maidenhead.

01:15:19.208 --> 01:15:22.201
- Where'd you steal the car?
- Danced for a bit at Skindles.

01:15:22.292 --> 01:15:25.456
Drank a lot of port and muck and dammit
if I didn't lose my way on the way back

01:15:25.542 --> 01:15:27.033
and get us stranded from anywhere.

01:15:27.125 --> 01:15:29.993
And the two little tarts started cursing
so I said, "Shut up

01:15:30.125 --> 01:15:33.163
"or I'll chuck you out in the road
and leave you there."

01:15:33.250 --> 01:15:36.243
Drove off doing 60. I didn't have
any trouble from them after that.

01:15:36.625 --> 01:15:37.741
Good little girls.

01:15:37.833 --> 01:15:41.031
You're the kind of man, Hibbert,
who makes girls hard to please.

01:15:44.708 --> 01:15:47.075
Don't you think
you've had enough Champagne?

01:15:47.708 --> 01:15:51.372
You wouldn't know good Champagne
if it was spat in your face.

01:15:57.583 --> 01:15:59.290
There you go, lads.
Tuck into that.

01:16:06.792 --> 01:16:08.328
Will you join us, sir?

01:16:13.917 --> 01:16:15.203
Here you are.

01:16:20.333 --> 01:16:21.744
Thank you.

01:16:23.083 --> 01:16:24.574
You did well, sir.

01:16:25.958 --> 01:16:27.745
Fought hard, sir.

01:16:27.833 --> 01:16:29.415
So did you.

01:16:30.208 --> 01:16:33.576
Did you see how much that lad struggled?

01:16:33.667 --> 01:16:36.080
- No.
- Don't know what hit him, poor sod.

01:16:36.167 --> 01:16:38.033
Your foot.

01:16:38.208 --> 01:16:39.790
Tastes all right, doesn't it?

01:16:41.125 --> 01:16:42.741
- What's in it?
- Horse.

01:16:43.875 --> 01:16:45.366
I'm joking.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.913
Jumped right down the hole,
grabbed him. I slipped up.

01:16:53.125 --> 01:16:55.117
- Yeah, he did and then I...
- Grabbed him.

01:16:55.208 --> 01:16:57.200
Kicked him up the rear end a few times.

01:17:01.042 --> 01:17:04.206
I wouldn't mind
taking her for a spin.

01:17:04.292 --> 01:17:08.582
I'd prefer a picture of Southport Pier.

01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:11.538
You don't understand anything about art.

01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:15.742
Mason! Whisky!

01:17:15.833 --> 01:17:18.325
- Think that's wise, skipper?
- Hmm?

01:17:18.417 --> 01:17:20.409
Well, on top of the Champagne?

01:17:22.083 --> 01:17:23.574
I think it's very wise.

01:17:27.333 --> 01:17:30.531
I have to tell you, sir, after this one,
there's no more whisky left.

01:17:30.625 --> 01:17:32.617
We brought six.

01:17:33.875 --> 01:17:35.332
Five have gone, sir.

01:17:41.250 --> 01:17:43.537
Tea, please, Mason. Please.

01:17:43.708 --> 01:17:44.994
Right you are, sir.

01:17:49.208 --> 01:17:51.450
I'd better go and relieve young Raleigh.

01:17:52.792 --> 01:17:54.158
He hasn't had any supper.

01:17:54.292 --> 01:17:56.329
I think he prefers it up there
with the men.

01:17:56.417 --> 01:17:57.908
What, he said that?

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.707
Not in so many words.

01:18:01.792 --> 01:18:06.036
Oh, he's just the sort of lad I'd have
liked, if we could have had kids.

01:18:07.083 --> 01:18:08.415
- Plucky.
- Oh, shut up!

01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:10.492
Did I ever tell you
about the girl I met in Soho?

01:18:10.583 --> 01:18:12.040
- Go to bed.
- What?

01:18:12.458 --> 01:18:15.622
I said, "Go to bed."

01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:18.117
- A nice way to end a jolly evening.
- Clear out.

01:18:18.208 --> 01:18:20.165
I'm not sure I'm the one
who needs to go to bed.

01:18:20.250 --> 01:18:21.331
Clear out of here.

01:18:21.458 --> 01:18:23.324
- What do you mean?
- Get out of here!

01:18:23.417 --> 01:18:27.457
- I have every right to be in this room.
- Clear out of my sight!

01:18:28.375 --> 01:18:29.786
Get out!

01:18:32.542 --> 01:18:34.158
Get out of my sight.

01:18:56.292 --> 01:18:59.660
Little worm.
Gets on my nerves.

01:19:01.208 --> 01:19:03.871
Doesn't his repulsive little mind
make you sick?

01:19:07.292 --> 01:19:09.079
Must be nice to be you, Trotter.

01:19:10.375 --> 01:19:12.913
You never get sick to death of anything.

01:19:13.875 --> 01:19:15.207
If only you knew.

01:19:15.333 --> 01:19:19.373
No, you're always the same.
No imagination.

01:19:31.833 --> 01:19:33.950
Tell Mason he can have my tea.

01:19:38.458 --> 01:19:41.701
You realise you're my second in command
now, don't you?

01:19:45.708 --> 01:19:47.290
I won't let you down, skipper.

01:19:51.583 --> 01:19:53.870
- Mason.
- Sir.

01:20:03.125 --> 01:20:04.741
Clear this filth.

01:20:04.875 --> 01:20:06.207
Very good, sir.

01:20:07.125 --> 01:20:08.957
And bring Mr Raleigh's dinner.

01:20:10.167 --> 01:20:11.453
Bert.

01:20:15.375 --> 01:20:16.741
Here you go, son.

01:20:17.542 --> 01:20:19.534
And lay a place for Mr Raleigh.

01:20:30.333 --> 01:20:31.665
Good lad.

01:20:41.833 --> 01:20:43.620
Captain Stanhope wants to see you.

01:20:44.792 --> 01:20:46.158
Go on. I'll take that.

01:20:53.625 --> 01:20:54.957
Good luck.

01:21:04.542 --> 01:21:06.078
Turner, cup!

01:21:28.417 --> 01:21:29.783
Dinner was at 8:00.

01:21:30.833 --> 01:21:32.495
We've kept it warm.

01:21:33.792 --> 01:21:35.158
Thank you.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.832
But I had something to eat out there.

01:21:37.917 --> 01:21:41.831
Do you think they want an officer
prowling around, sucking up to them?

01:21:42.625 --> 01:21:44.287
Why did they share their rations, then?

01:21:44.375 --> 01:21:46.287
So you know my men better than I do?

01:21:47.083 --> 01:21:48.745
- Sit down.
- I'm all right, thanks.

01:21:48.917 --> 01:21:50.374
Sit down!

01:21:54.375 --> 01:21:55.866
Thank you, Mason.

01:22:09.375 --> 01:22:11.992
You insulted Trotter and Hibbert
by not coming down.

01:22:15.333 --> 01:22:17.290
My officers work together.

01:22:18.083 --> 01:22:19.745
I'll have no damn prigs!

01:22:25.417 --> 01:22:26.783
I am sorry.

01:22:27.625 --> 01:22:29.207
I'll speak to them.

01:22:35.458 --> 01:22:37.120
What are you staring at?

01:22:37.208 --> 01:22:39.074
Anything funny about me?

01:22:44.292 --> 01:22:47.490
I'm sorry if I annoyed you
by joining this company.

01:22:48.542 --> 01:22:50.784
What on earth are you talking about?

01:22:50.917 --> 01:22:54.786
- Eat your dinner before it gets cold.
- I'm not hungry.

01:22:54.875 --> 01:22:57.208
Sit down and eat it like a man!

01:22:57.292 --> 01:23:00.956
How can I when Osborne
is lying out there?

01:23:01.083 --> 01:23:02.745
You bloody little swine!

01:23:02.833 --> 01:23:04.916
You think you're the only man who cares?

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.616
No, but you were drinking Champagne.

01:23:06.708 --> 01:23:08.324
The one man I could trust!

01:23:08.417 --> 01:23:11.535
The one man I could talk to man-to-man!

01:23:11.625 --> 01:23:15.744
- Who understood everything!
- How can you...

01:23:15.875 --> 01:23:18.618
You think there's no limit
to what a man can bear?

01:23:38.292 --> 01:23:40.955
Get out. Get out. Get out.

01:25:16.375 --> 01:25:17.991
- Cup of tea.
- Lovely.

01:25:32.167 --> 01:25:34.955
Right, Bert. That's us.

01:25:42.292 --> 01:25:43.703
Sir.

01:25:48.167 --> 01:25:49.908
I've got you a nice, hot
cup of tea, sir.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.787
It's quiet enough now.

01:26:02.875 --> 01:26:04.411
But you never know, do you?

01:26:07.708 --> 01:26:10.416
That's the stuff for troops.
A good cup of tea.

01:26:10.542 --> 01:26:12.408
I've cut four packets
of Sam Bridges, sir.

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:15.163
- Mmm-hmm.
- Half bully beef, half sardine.

01:26:15.292 --> 01:26:17.284
No pÃ¢tÃ© de foie gras, Mason?

01:26:17.375 --> 01:26:19.788
- Milkman hasn't come yet, sir.
- Thank you, Mason.

01:26:19.958 --> 01:26:22.291
Clear up your kitchen a bit.
Then join Mr Trotter.

01:26:24.792 --> 01:26:26.283
Very good, sir.

01:26:26.375 --> 01:26:27.741
Sir.

01:26:38.708 --> 01:26:41.121
Right, that's me.

01:26:42.208 --> 01:26:43.574
I'm done.

01:26:45.625 --> 01:26:47.082
Cheerio, skipper.

01:26:50.458 --> 01:26:51.869
Cheerio.

01:27:05.625 --> 01:27:06.991
Right.

01:27:14.583 --> 01:27:16.199
Cheerio, Stanhope.

01:27:18.333 --> 01:27:20.825
Cheerio, Raleigh. I'll be up in a tick.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.866
- Cheerio, sir.
- Turner.

01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:36.618
- Sir.
- Hammond.

01:27:43.125 --> 01:27:44.491
Hibbert.

01:28:01.042 --> 01:28:02.374
Hibbert!

01:28:06.833 --> 01:28:08.119
Come on.

01:28:09.208 --> 01:28:10.324
There's no hurry.

01:28:10.417 --> 01:28:12.534
The longer you stay here,
the harder it'll be to go up.

01:28:12.625 --> 01:28:14.742
It's no good going up until I feel fit.

01:28:14.833 --> 01:28:16.119
Drink this.

01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:18.957
Then you need to go up.

01:28:39.292 --> 01:28:40.783
All set, sir.

01:28:40.917 --> 01:28:43.751
I'll pop down again at 10:00.
Get the spuds peeled.

01:28:43.917 --> 01:28:45.158
All right, Mason.

01:28:45.958 --> 01:28:48.325
- Mr Hibbert will lead the way.
- Sir.

01:28:55.958 --> 01:28:59.156
- Cheerio, sir.
- Cheerio, Mason.

01:30:42.458 --> 01:30:44.324
- All right?
- Sir.

01:30:45.417 --> 01:30:46.828
Get ready.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.366
Good.

01:31:05.458 --> 01:31:08.371
Hey? Come on.

01:32:27.042 --> 01:32:28.999
Stand tall! Stand tall!

01:32:30.667 --> 01:32:33.956
Hold the line! Hold the line!

01:32:34.125 --> 01:32:36.037
Stay down! Stay down!

01:32:36.958 --> 01:32:38.620
Keep down!

01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:41.037
Take cover! Mason!

01:32:42.042 --> 01:32:45.001
Hold the line! Hold the line!

01:32:48.958 --> 01:32:52.156
Frontmen, stay down! Stay down!

01:32:55.167 --> 01:32:56.578
Stay down!

01:33:11.667 --> 01:33:13.374
Is everyone all right?

01:33:28.875 --> 01:33:32.289
Sir! Mr Raleigh's been hit, sir!

01:33:33.875 --> 01:33:35.207
Right...

01:33:36.542 --> 01:33:38.283
We need to get him inside!

01:33:38.375 --> 01:33:40.583
His back's struck! We need a stretcher!

01:33:40.667 --> 01:33:42.249
Help me get him up!

01:33:47.917 --> 01:33:49.158
Come on!

01:33:49.292 --> 01:33:51.579
Stretcher bearer!

01:33:54.958 --> 01:33:56.790
Stretcher bearer!

01:34:05.125 --> 01:34:06.866
All right.

01:34:07.083 --> 01:34:08.415
All right. You can go.

01:34:15.125 --> 01:34:16.661
We need to get him down the line!

01:34:16.750 --> 01:34:18.207
- Can't with those shells falling, sir!
- We must!

01:34:18.417 --> 01:34:20.534
We can't, sir!
We've hemmed ourselves in!

01:34:20.708 --> 01:34:23.325
- Fetch the stretcher bearers!
- Sir.

01:34:24.167 --> 01:34:27.001
- Stretcher bearers!
- It's all right, it's all right.

01:34:32.958 --> 01:34:35.041
Soon wear off.

01:34:38.125 --> 01:34:40.708
You caught a blighty one, Jimmy.

01:34:41.458 --> 01:34:44.246
Home again.

01:34:44.417 --> 01:34:47.740
I can't be sent home
just for a knock in the back.

01:34:49.458 --> 01:34:51.290
It's like in rugger.

01:34:52.375 --> 01:34:54.708
"Get up and dust yourself off, boy."

01:34:58.625 --> 01:35:01.413
It's bound to hurt a bit, Jimmy.

01:35:02.917 --> 01:35:06.410
There's... There's something
pressing down on my legs.

01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:14.241
It's just the shock.

01:35:15.208 --> 01:35:17.916
I can't... I can't...

01:35:18.042 --> 01:35:22.241
I can't be down here,
when everyone else is... Is fighting.

01:35:22.333 --> 01:35:23.824
It's not your fault.

01:35:24.333 --> 01:35:25.869
It's not your fault.

01:35:30.708 --> 01:35:34.156
Don't... Don't wait for me
if you need to go.

01:35:34.250 --> 01:35:37.539
It's quite all right, Jimmy.
It's all right.

01:35:39.583 --> 01:35:41.165
Can you stay?

01:35:44.875 --> 01:35:46.537
Of course I can.

01:35:48.083 --> 01:35:49.449
I'm here.

01:35:55.292 --> 01:35:58.126
- I'm... I'm so...
- Shh.

01:35:58.208 --> 01:35:59.699
So cold.

01:36:14.208 --> 01:36:15.824
Here... Here we go.

01:36:15.917 --> 01:36:17.283
Is that better?

01:36:20.458 --> 01:36:21.869
Jimmy?

01:36:26.875 --> 01:36:28.241
Jimmy...

01:36:44.875 --> 01:36:47.788
Sergeant Major says
can you come at once, sir?

01:36:50.292 --> 01:36:52.830
- Sir!
- All right, Turner. I'm coming.

01:38:54.542 --> 01:38:56.204
Thank you.

01:39:08.208 --> 01:39:11.952
<i>"My dear Margaret.
I am at the front at last.</i>

01:39:12.792 --> 01:39:16.285
<i>"I was taken along some trenches
and reported to C Company.</i>

01:39:16.417 --> 01:39:20.661
<i>"A nice officer greeted me.
He was quite old. Second in command.</i>

01:39:20.792 --> 01:39:25.082
<i>"And then there he was,
Captain Stanhope, MC.</i>

01:39:25.208 --> 01:39:29.031
<i>"Tired because he works so hard,
because of all the responsibility.</i>

01:39:29.917 --> 01:39:31.874
<i>"Then I went on duty on the front line,</i>

01:39:31.958 --> 01:39:33.950
<i>"where the officers told me
all about him.</i>

01:39:34.042 --> 01:39:36.284
<i>"The finest officer
in the whole battalion</i>

01:39:36.417 --> 01:39:38.704
<i>"and the men simply adore him.</i>

01:39:38.833 --> 01:39:41.621
<i>"I'm proud to think
that he is my friend.</i>

01:39:41.708 --> 01:39:44.291
<i>"Your ever loving brother, Jimmy."</i>
