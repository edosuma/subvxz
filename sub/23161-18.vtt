00:03.220 --> 00:06.348
There's five lost songs
worth about a million dollars
apiece.

00:06.424 --> 00:08.824
And Thomas and his assistants
are going to split 10%.

00:08.893 --> 00:11.259
Believe me,
if any of my nurses had
been the object

00:11.329 --> 00:13.490
of five beautiful love songs,
I'd have known about it.

00:13.564 --> 00:15.361
Whatever I have to do,

00:15.433 --> 00:17.993
<i>Billy Cockrell is not</i>
<i>getting those songs.</i>

00:18.736 --> 00:21.170
She's got them
and we must've led him
right to her.

00:21.872 --> 00:23.100
<i>You tell me...</i>

00:23.174 --> 00:24.232
T. C?

00:24.308 --> 00:25.866
You better throw
wide and duck.

00:26.410 --> 00:27.741
Come on, you guys.

02:35.172 --> 02:36.867
Thank you all. Thank you.

02:41.212 --> 02:42.406
Thank you.

02:43.981 --> 02:46.973
Georgie, hey, come on.
Get up. Are you okay?
I'm okay.

02:50.554 --> 02:52.818
You get him back out there.
Contract says encore.

02:52.890 --> 02:54.152
That was an encore.

02:56.260 --> 02:58.251
Hey, get her on the phone
for me, Lacy, will you?

02:58.329 --> 02:59.728
I wanna give her
the good news.

02:59.797 --> 03:01.389
George Lee Jessup!

03:01.465 --> 03:04.525
Yes, now, folks,
are we gonna let him get away
without one more song?

03:04.602 --> 03:06.229
No! No!

03:06.303 --> 03:09.397
Operator?
Get me Honolulu, Hawaii.

03:09.473 --> 03:11.600
5-3-5-7-2.

03:11.675 --> 03:13.700
Georgie, hey,
you know, listen.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.369
We'll call her
from Richmond.

03:15.446 --> 03:16.936
I can have us there
in an hour.

03:17.014 --> 03:18.982
Billy, leave him alone!

03:19.049 --> 03:22.018
One more song!
One more song!

03:22.119 --> 03:23.916
George Lee Jessup!

03:24.255 --> 03:25.347
He's drunker than hell.

03:25.723 --> 03:28.248
His fans have seen him
tanked up before.
It don't bother them.

03:28.325 --> 03:30.987
Why,
because you say it don't?

03:31.061 --> 03:32.392
Drop it, Billy.

03:32.463 --> 03:34.761
Get the rest of the boys
and head for the car.

03:36.934 --> 03:40.233
One more song!
One more song!

03:40.304 --> 03:42.033
George Lee Jessup!

03:42.106 --> 03:46.907
One more song!
One more song!
George Lee Jessup!

03:46.977 --> 03:48.877
Here you go, Georgie.
She's on.

03:50.414 --> 03:51.642
Thanks, Lacy.

03:56.320 --> 03:57.480
Laurie?

03:59.323 --> 04:02.190
Hey, baby.
Are you sitting down?

04:02.760 --> 04:05.854
Yeah, we're finally
gonna do it, honey.
Pack up your uniforms.

04:09.500 --> 04:12.469
Well, I mean,
I found me a general
who loves my music,

04:12.670 --> 04:15.332
and he's gonna get you
a transfer to one of them
bases in Texas

04:15.406 --> 04:17.499
till your discharge papers
come through.

04:18.041 --> 04:20.909
And I play Dallas next week.
Now what do you think of that?

04:22.379 --> 04:25.678
I'm asking you politely now.
Please step on back.

04:26.116 --> 04:27.981
Hey, we're gonna
get married there.

04:35.426 --> 04:37.826
Hey, Laurie,
come on now, baby.
Now quit kidding around, now.

04:37.895 --> 04:39.590
You! You!
Stop shoving, now.

04:40.864 --> 04:43.355
Now, Laurie, I said,
now quit kidding around, baby.

04:45.302 --> 04:46.326
Laurie?

05:13.297 --> 05:15.595
Hey, let's get this thing
in the air fast.

05:15.666 --> 05:17.065
Talk to Georgie.

05:18.702 --> 05:20.067
I ain't the pilot.

05:20.137 --> 05:23.004
Hey! What do you mean?

05:23.073 --> 05:24.335
Of course you're the pilot.

05:24.408 --> 05:27.502
No, Lacy, that's what
I wound up being.

05:28.178 --> 05:31.272
I'm a good picker
and I'm a good writer

05:31.348 --> 05:34.647
and I'm sick of flying
and playing bass

05:35.219 --> 05:37.847
and getting pushed around
by the big star's flunky.

05:37.921 --> 05:39.388
Will you get serious, Billy?

05:39.456 --> 05:42.516
You mean to tell me
you'd let Georgie
take us up tonight?

05:42.593 --> 05:44.322
You know he's had too much.

05:44.395 --> 05:46.056
And he and Laurie
just had a big spat.

05:46.130 --> 05:49.566
Lacy, those are
his problems and yours.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.531
I'm on the next bus
back to Nashville.

05:52.603 --> 05:53.934
Damn right!

05:56.340 --> 05:58.865
Hey, Georgie, I'll get us
a hotel here tonight.

05:58.942 --> 06:01.069
George... Billy, please.

06:07.017 --> 06:08.177
Georgie!

06:47.324 --> 06:50.452
No, no, no, no. Pianissimo,
ladies and gentlemen, please.

06:50.527 --> 06:53.257
All I'm hearing is one harsh,
constant...

07:03.374 --> 07:05.808
Thomas, can't you
turn that thing down?

07:05.876 --> 07:09.778
Magnum, stop playing
that record immediately!

07:09.847 --> 07:13.078
Higgins, now, listen,
I'm sorry I disturbed
your rehearsal,

07:13.150 --> 07:16.449
but I had to listen to it
that loud in order to hear
the lyrics for clues!

07:16.520 --> 07:19.318
No, it's all
in the line of work.
Higgins, don't break it!

07:19.390 --> 07:21.221
Now, it belongs
to the library
and it's...

07:21.291 --> 07:23.259
One of George Lee Jessup's
rarest recordings

07:23.327 --> 07:26.319
and you may very well
have damaged the grooves
with this modern stylus!

07:26.397 --> 07:28.160
You're into this
hillbilly yuck?

07:28.232 --> 07:30.427
This hillbilly yuck
happens to trace its roots

07:30.501 --> 07:31.900
back to the Saxon
folk ballads.

07:31.969 --> 07:34.733
Yeah, well, fortunately,
Higgins, we don't have
to go back that far.

07:34.805 --> 07:37.774
No, your research, I'm sure,
begins and ends with 1954.

07:37.841 --> 07:39.069
Higgins...
You got it!

07:39.143 --> 07:41.577
Five million bucks
of this guy's old records
laying around.

07:41.645 --> 07:45.411
And Thomas and his assistants
are gonna split 10%%
just for finding the stuff.

07:45.482 --> 07:48.417
Yes, the lost Jessup songs
could easily be that valuable

07:48.485 --> 07:50.043
if they existed.
They do not.

07:50.120 --> 07:51.644
Higgins, this doesn't
concern you.

07:51.722 --> 07:55.556
What concerns me is that
you could so easily be duped
by such a ridiculous myth.

07:55.626 --> 07:58.618
Every moment of
Jessup's hospitalization here
has been researched.

07:58.695 --> 08:01.562
There was no nurse,
no love affair
and therefore, no songs.

08:01.632 --> 08:03.998
Well, yes, the client
does admit

08:04.067 --> 08:07.002
that no one else
has any faith
in the songs but him.

08:07.070 --> 08:10.471
But you saw no reason
to bring this up

08:10.541 --> 08:12.202
before you conned us
into this?

08:12.276 --> 08:14.506
I didn't con you!
This guy has proof!

08:14.578 --> 08:17.741
There's five lost songs
worth about a million dollars
apiece.

08:17.815 --> 08:20.909
That's absurd.
How could he possibly
know the exact number?

08:21.819 --> 08:23.184
Because he's an expert!

08:23.253 --> 08:24.982
Well, no true expert
would dare to attempt

08:25.055 --> 08:27.615
to determine the value
of works by a legend
like Jessup.

08:27.691 --> 08:30.285
Hold it! Just hold it!

08:30.360 --> 08:32.692
You two guys are
arguing about songs
that don't even exist?

08:32.763 --> 08:34.059
Yes!
No!

08:34.832 --> 08:36.924
You can count me out.

08:37.134 --> 08:39.602
No! Wait, T.C.,
Higgins is wrong!

08:56.787 --> 08:58.755
Well, that's
a pretty good fiddle.

08:59.189 --> 09:01.180
The A string's
just a hair sharp.

09:01.792 --> 09:03.487
What's the meaning of this?

09:03.560 --> 09:06.996
Oh, it just means that
his A's not a perfect fifth
from his D.

09:07.064 --> 09:08.964
Who are you?
How did you get on the estate?

09:09.032 --> 09:12.126
And what manner of man simply
picks up a $20,000 violin

09:12.202 --> 09:13.897
and plays it without
asking permission?

09:13.971 --> 09:16.804
Well, Lacy Fletcher's
the name. I come by taxi.

09:16.874 --> 09:20.469
And what manner of man
asks a fiddle if it wants
to be played?

09:20.544 --> 09:22.011
Something wrong, Higgins?

09:22.112 --> 09:25.309
Thomas Magnum, Lacy.
I'm sorry I didn't
pick you up at the airport.

09:25.382 --> 09:28.818
That's all right.
You didn't have to hire
a band to welcome me.

09:29.953 --> 09:33.480
The band is the Oahu
String Quartet, Mr. Fletcher.

09:33.557 --> 09:36.287
We're rehearsing
for our maiden recital.

09:36.894 --> 09:41.228
I'm Jonathan Higgins,
the conductor, and it's
a great honor to meet you.

09:41.298 --> 09:42.663
Likewise.

09:42.866 --> 09:44.891
That's Theodore Calvin.
Rick Wright.

09:45.435 --> 09:47.266
They're helping me out
on the case.

09:47.337 --> 09:49.771
Wrong, wrong.
No offense, Lacy,

09:49.840 --> 09:52.673
but from what I understand,
no one else believes
these songs exist.

09:52.743 --> 09:55.644
Including George Lee Jessup's
closest friend.

09:56.062 --> 09:58.553
At least that's what
he's always told the press.

09:58.632 --> 10:00.156
Correct, Mr. Fletcher?

10:00.934 --> 10:04.961
I thought you told me
on the phone that you were
a private investigator?

10:05.538 --> 10:06.903
Now, wait a minute, Lacy.

10:06.973 --> 10:09.965
Wait, nothing!
I've been waiting
for 30 years.

10:10.043 --> 10:14.912
Lying to the press, everybody,
'cause if those songs had
been found before now,

10:14.981 --> 10:17.006
Georgie's estate
would've got them.

10:17.450 --> 10:22.547
Well, the time finally comes
when whoever finds them,
gets them.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.983
And the one person
that I tell my secret to

10:25.058 --> 10:26.923
has got to blab it
all over the island.

10:26.993 --> 10:29.894
Hey, hey, nobody's trying
to steal your songs.

10:30.196 --> 10:32.027
In fact, as far as
I'm concerned,

10:32.098 --> 10:33.497
you're the only one
that believes in them.

10:33.566 --> 10:35.625
Mr. Fletcher, do you have
proof that the songs exist?

10:35.702 --> 10:37.966
Yeah. My word.

10:39.406 --> 10:40.600
And this.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.574
Probably all you'll need
to find Laurie.

10:52.719 --> 10:55.517
But how could
he have called her
at the same pay phone

10:55.588 --> 10:57.453
every Saturday night,
for over a year?

10:59.960 --> 11:00.949
Lacy?

11:02.796 --> 11:03.956
Lacy!

11:04.564 --> 11:07.829
Well, maybe, she lived
in the WAC barracks.

11:07.901 --> 11:11.496
Well, fine. Then all four
of the Lauries there in '54
could've used it.

11:11.571 --> 11:13.664
Well, then you just got
to look up the pay phones

11:13.740 --> 11:15.332
in the different
barrack hallways.

11:15.408 --> 11:18.844
Lacy, it's not that simple.
The phones aren't listed
numerically.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.345
We could be here all night.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.643
Well, I could've hired
anybody to complain.

11:22.716 --> 11:25.844
You gotta expect to
put out a little effort
for your $500,000.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.216
Put out a little...

11:27.554 --> 11:30.853
A half day
at the Army archives,
another half day here.

11:30.924 --> 11:33.791
A whole day with Ms. Jones
at the hall of records.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.088
Put out a little...

11:35.161 --> 11:36.788
<i>Mr. And Mrs. Jones,</i>
<i>if you please</i>

11:36.863 --> 11:38.626
<i>And the desk clerk smirks</i>
<i>on hands and knees</i>

11:38.698 --> 11:39.824
Lacy.

11:41.267 --> 11:44.293
Lacy. Lacy. Please.

11:44.971 --> 11:46.268
I'm sorry,

11:46.339 --> 11:50.537
but two straight days
of non-stop country gold
is a lot.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.470
Could we just take a break?

11:53.546 --> 11:56.947
Hey, break ball don't have
to fall on me.
Fine. Thank you.

11:57.650 --> 11:59.845
You know what?
I've been meaning to ask you.

11:59.919 --> 12:03.013
Why didn't you call her
at that pay phone
after the plane crash?

12:03.089 --> 12:05.990
Well, I did. Soon as
I got out of the hospital.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.526
It was disconnected.

12:07.727 --> 12:08.785
What?

12:11.564 --> 12:13.555
The five-digit number
wasn't converted?

12:13.633 --> 12:15.533
Why didn't you tell me?

12:15.602 --> 12:17.832
Well, what difference
does it make?

12:17.904 --> 12:20.930
The difference is,
I would've been looking
in the right place.

12:21.007 --> 12:22.372
Now, when did you call her?

12:22.442 --> 12:27.072
Well, it was
early November, 1954.

12:27.147 --> 12:28.136
Why?

12:28.481 --> 12:33.145
Lacy,
those old phone numbers are
listed by their cut-off date.

12:39.626 --> 12:43.027
Right. Here it is.
5-3-5-7-2.

12:43.730 --> 12:48.030
"Removed 11-2-54 from
Pearl Harbor Hospital
nurses' lounge."

12:49.135 --> 12:52.332
Nurses...
Hey, you're cooking.
I can tell. Right, huh?

12:54.174 --> 12:58.167
Prince, Prince. "Sergeant
Laura Johnson Prince,

12:58.378 --> 13:01.438
"discharged May 1955,
married to Desmond."

13:02.582 --> 13:05.676
Lacy, she's still living
here on the island.
Hey, that's great.

13:05.752 --> 13:07.549
Maybe the other three
are, too, then, huh?

13:07.620 --> 13:11.818
Yeah, but the other three
weren't working next to
that pay phone all of 1954.

13:12.058 --> 13:15.585
Hey, I think you got it.

13:16.996 --> 13:20.796
But I'm afraid
I've never even heard
of your Mr. Jessup.

13:20.867 --> 13:22.596
Well, at least
I've heard the name.

13:22.669 --> 13:25.661
He was a cowboy singer
in the '50s, wasn't he?

13:25.738 --> 13:28.969
Country music artist.
There's a difference.

13:29.042 --> 13:30.532
I see. I'm sorry.

13:30.610 --> 13:34.603
Mrs. Crane, are you sure
that none of the other
Lauries on that list

13:34.681 --> 13:36.649
could have worked
near that telephone?

13:36.983 --> 13:39.315
Well, not in '54.

13:39.385 --> 13:42.115
I was the ward nurses'
supervisor.

13:42.589 --> 13:45.080
You positive this woman
was enlisted?

13:45.325 --> 13:48.590
Yes, ma'am. She was a WAC.
There's no doubt about it.

13:48.661 --> 13:51.186
Georgie couldn't talk
about anything else

13:51.264 --> 13:53.562
except when she was gonna
get her discharge papers.

13:53.633 --> 13:56.227
Wait a minute.
This was a long time ago.

13:56.870 --> 13:59.031
Honey, you don't recall
a girl saying

13:59.105 --> 14:01.869
that she had a boyfriend
who wrote country tunes?

14:02.008 --> 14:03.771
I'm afraid not.

14:04.878 --> 14:07.346
Believe me,
if any of my nurses had
been the object

14:07.413 --> 14:10.246
of five beautiful love songs,
I'd have known about it.

14:10.316 --> 14:14.275
Young ladies have
a tendency to brag
about that sort of thing.

14:19.692 --> 14:22.525
- That woman is lying.
- Now, wait a minute.

14:22.595 --> 14:24.290
She didn't deserve Georgie.

14:55.159 --> 14:56.148
Lacy.

14:56.727 --> 14:58.592
Hey, Magnum.

14:59.563 --> 15:01.087
Well, I found it.

15:01.832 --> 15:05.029
Right here's the place.
This is where
he wrote the song.

15:05.402 --> 15:09.736
See, he had this real bad
shrapnel wound that he got
over there in Korea...

15:09.807 --> 15:11.035
I know, Lacy.

15:12.209 --> 15:14.700
Yeah,
they sent him over here...
I know, you told me.

15:14.778 --> 15:16.405
Yeah. To the hospital.

15:17.715 --> 15:19.444
That's the retainer
you gave me.

15:23.187 --> 15:25.155
You don't think
that there is a case.

15:26.824 --> 15:27.950
Oh...

15:29.393 --> 15:32.021
It doesn't really matter
what I believe, Lacy.

15:33.998 --> 15:36.159
I know it's not in you
to doubt Jessup.

15:36.233 --> 15:39.669
That's right.
One thing about Georgie,
he never lied.

15:39.737 --> 15:42.228
Well, fine. Fine.

15:42.306 --> 15:45.742
But George Lee Jessup's
word is not a lead.

15:45.809 --> 15:47.834
And the only tangible one
you gave me is gone.

15:47.911 --> 15:49.845
You're wrong.
You're dead wrong.

15:49.913 --> 15:52.939
That phone number
did its job.
It led us to Laurie.

15:53.784 --> 15:56.981
So you keep telling me,
but you've got absolutely
no proof.

15:57.054 --> 15:58.487
Don't I?

16:01.392 --> 16:03.383
Let me ask you something,
Magnum.

16:04.995 --> 16:07.486
How did she know that
there were just five songs?

16:08.165 --> 16:09.496
Five?
Yeah.

16:09.566 --> 16:12.899
That's what
she said yesterday,
"Five beautiful songs."

16:13.370 --> 16:15.565
Now, nobody knew
the exact number,

16:15.639 --> 16:18.802
except me and her and Georgie.

16:19.109 --> 16:21.577
And you're the first person
that I've ever told.

16:23.080 --> 16:25.071
Maybe she made a wild guess.

16:25.449 --> 16:27.383
I'm sorry, Lacy,
it's not enough.

16:29.687 --> 16:32.656
Well, okay, all right.
You get me a copy
of her handwriting,

16:32.723 --> 16:35.123
and I'll give you
all the proof that you want.

16:37.594 --> 16:41.621
Well, I guess I got no choice
but to trust you all the way.
Here, hold this.

16:43.801 --> 16:48.761
There was this private box
where I used to pick up
Georgie's letters from her.

16:49.540 --> 16:51.269
It was a kind of
a secret thing.

16:51.341 --> 16:52.968
Now, this letter here...

16:53.043 --> 16:57.139
Well, she evidently hadn't
heard about the accident
when she wrote it.

16:57.214 --> 17:00.513
It was in the box
when I got out
of the hospital.

17:01.185 --> 17:02.550
It's never been opened.

17:03.353 --> 17:05.445
I know.
That's Georgie's private mail.

17:06.390 --> 17:07.584
Private?

17:07.891 --> 17:10.758
Lacy, he's been dead
for 30 years. You never
opened this, knowing...

17:10.828 --> 17:14.992
Hey, listen, I looked
after Georgie's privacy
when he was alive.

17:15.365 --> 17:18.391
Well, I'm sure not gonna start
peeking in his keyholes now.

17:18.469 --> 17:22.428
Well, you're asking me
to peek into Laurie Crane's,
without good reason.

17:26.009 --> 17:30.207
I've played
a darn good poker hand,
waiting out that copyright.

17:31.782 --> 17:35.183
You know, when I told
everybody that there wasn't
any more songs,

17:35.552 --> 17:36.814
and they believed me.

17:38.455 --> 17:41.652
Now it comes time
to pick up the pot and...

17:45.629 --> 17:47.324
Well, I need some help.

18:01.245 --> 18:04.214
I hocked everything that
I got to make this trip.

18:05.549 --> 18:07.813
If I go back empty-handed...

18:09.386 --> 18:12.082
Well, I guess you'd say
that I'm finished.

18:16.560 --> 18:19.393
That seems like
reason enough to me

18:20.364 --> 18:22.855
to get one little
old handwriting sample.

18:23.467 --> 18:25.196
I'll talk to her again.

18:26.537 --> 18:27.595
Alone.

18:27.704 --> 18:28.966
Yeah.

18:31.441 --> 18:33.272
<i>Talk to me</i>
<i>about what, Mr. Magnum?</i>

18:33.477 --> 18:36.071
Well, I was wondering
if you could just give me
a short written statement

18:36.146 --> 18:39.445
verifying what you
told me yesterday.
Just for my records.

18:39.516 --> 18:42.417
I fail to see why I should
have to verify anything.

18:42.653 --> 18:45.645
Well, no, no,
but this'll just take
a few minutes.

18:46.924 --> 18:49.358
A few minutes, a day.

18:49.560 --> 18:51.824
I don't have the time
or the inclination.

18:51.895 --> 18:53.886
All right?
Well, that's fine. Fine.

18:53.964 --> 18:57.161
Why don't I just jot down
what you told me and I'll
bring it by for you to sign?

18:57.234 --> 18:59.202
It would just say
that you never knew Jessup.

18:59.269 --> 19:01.533
No! I'm sorry.

19:02.005 --> 19:04.337
I don't know where
everybody got the idea

19:04.408 --> 19:06.308
that I was George's lover
in the first place.

19:06.376 --> 19:08.537
Yes, where indeed?

19:09.379 --> 19:10.573
Mr. Magnum,

19:11.248 --> 19:14.012
you've worn out your welcome.
Now, would you please leave?

19:14.818 --> 19:16.046
I'm just trying to...

19:16.119 --> 19:19.452
You're trying to talk
my wife out of something
she's handwritten. Why?

19:19.523 --> 19:22.356
And don't tell me
it has anything to do
with your records.

19:22.426 --> 19:26.556
Look, Lacy has a letter
written by this Laurie
to Jessup.

19:26.630 --> 19:30.430
Now, this whole thing could be
cleared up by a simple
handwriting comparison.

19:30.500 --> 19:31.489
Look,

19:32.135 --> 19:33.864
we've tried being
very nice about this,

19:33.937 --> 19:37.168
but if you and those
country music people
don't stop bothering us,

19:37.241 --> 19:38.606
I'm gonna call the police.

19:38.675 --> 19:41.200
Excuse me a second.
"Those country music people"?

19:41.278 --> 19:45.339
A Nashville publisher,
yesterday after you left
and early today.

19:45.983 --> 19:50.215
Believe me, we would gladly
take their million if we had
the songs, but we don't.

19:50.287 --> 19:54.587
Now you listen to me
very carefully.
My wife is not your Laurie.

19:59.429 --> 20:01.863
♪ Sweet, sad and wild ♪

20:02.232 --> 20:04.792
♪ We're like a flaming rocket ♪

20:04.868 --> 20:07.928
♪ That bursts and then it dies ♪

20:08.005 --> 20:11.202
♪ 'Cause after cheating kisses, ♪
♪ honey ♪

20:11.275 --> 20:13.709
♪ Comes the hurting time ♪

20:13.777 --> 20:15.404
Yeah, you got it.

20:15.913 --> 20:18.939
♪ After cheating kisses, honey ♪

20:19.016 --> 20:21.814
♪ Comes the hurting time ♪

20:25.722 --> 20:28.623
First recorded
on March 4, 1953.

20:28.692 --> 20:31.661
Well, I couldn't
say for sure.
We cut a lot of songs.

20:33.597 --> 20:35.827
Well, I'd best get
back to work.

20:35.999 --> 20:38.194
Higgins, you know,
I'd feel a lot better

20:38.268 --> 20:42.898
about taking your offer
of a room if I could
help out around here.

20:44.107 --> 20:48.510
Well, now you could tune
Mr. Lahani's third.
It's a hair out again.

21:20.711 --> 21:21.939
Extraordinary.

21:22.946 --> 21:24.971
I'm not familiar
with that music.

21:25.315 --> 21:26.407
Late French?

21:27.184 --> 21:29.414
No, it's early
Lacy Fletcher.

21:29.586 --> 21:31.816
I really used to be
into classical stuff.

21:34.725 --> 21:37.125
Has it ever
been performed publicly?

21:37.661 --> 21:39.492
No, I'm afraid not.

21:39.563 --> 21:42.430
Never could come up
with a decent set
of lyrics for it.

21:43.367 --> 21:45.232
I'm quite serious, Lacy.

21:45.302 --> 21:48.703
The Oahu String Quartet
would be most honored
to premier it.

21:49.406 --> 21:52.170
Well, that's very flattering,
Higgins, but...

21:52.476 --> 21:55.104
Hey, there's no way I could
score that in two days.

21:55.178 --> 21:56.543
Lacy?

21:56.613 --> 21:58.513
Hey, any luck?
Did you get it?

21:59.449 --> 22:01.440
Lacy, who's Billy Cockrell?

22:03.754 --> 22:05.244
How much did he offer them?

22:05.489 --> 22:07.150
A million, and still bidding.

22:07.858 --> 22:10.292
That sneaking...
Damn!

22:10.727 --> 22:11.887
I knew it!

22:11.962 --> 22:14.487
The only other person
that knows that she's got them

22:14.564 --> 22:16.464
and we must've led him
right to her!

22:16.533 --> 22:19.434
Oh, well, never mind.
I gotta stop him from
getting Georgie's stuff.

22:19.503 --> 22:22.336
Calm down, Lacy.
The Cranes didn't accept it.
They're not admitting...

22:22.406 --> 22:24.499
Oh, sure! Why not wait
till he goes to two million?

22:24.574 --> 22:25.871
Robin Masters' estate.

22:25.942 --> 22:28.342
Lacy, wait a minute.
No! Whatever I have to do,

22:28.412 --> 22:31.347
Billy Cockrell is not
getting those songs.

22:31.415 --> 22:34.350
Yes, one moment. A woman.
Why does she have this number?

22:35.352 --> 22:37.445
Because I wanted to be sure
she could reach me.

22:37.521 --> 22:39.512
Hello?
- <i>Mr. Magnum?</i>

22:40.457 --> 22:42.288
I'm here, Mrs. Crane.

22:45.529 --> 22:46.518
Well?

22:48.265 --> 22:50.893
I don't understand.
You asked for the meeting.

22:51.635 --> 22:54.468
Yes. And you asked
for a sample
of my handwriting.

22:54.738 --> 22:56.706
But what you were
really interested in

22:56.773 --> 22:59.264
is seeing if I'd react
to the mention of a letter.

22:59.843 --> 23:01.242
May I see it, please?

23:01.645 --> 23:04.546
I don't have it.
Lacy never lets it out
of his sight.

23:04.948 --> 23:07.917
I'm sure he would,
for the right arrangement.

23:08.351 --> 23:10.546
Mrs. Crane, that letter's
never been opened.

23:14.091 --> 23:19.358
I think that it would mean
a lot to Lacy just to give it
back to the real Laurie.

23:19.863 --> 23:21.387
Songs or no songs.

23:21.465 --> 23:25.094
The only arrangement
he wants

23:25.802 --> 23:28.635
is for her to say that
she loved George Lee Jessup.

23:30.073 --> 23:31.597
That's not possible.

23:33.210 --> 23:37.772
Maybe even sometime
when Desmond isn't around?

23:39.716 --> 23:41.911
You were married
to him then,
weren't you?

23:42.986 --> 23:44.886
I checked
your marriage license.

23:46.990 --> 23:48.924
Is that what was
in the letter?

23:49.025 --> 23:51.323
I wrote it the night
George was killed.

23:51.628 --> 23:55.758
When he called that night
and told me that
he'd gotten me a transfer,

23:55.999 --> 24:00.936
I'm afraid...
I'm sure I was very abrupt.

24:04.207 --> 24:06.607
I just said, "No."

24:07.310 --> 24:10.473
After saying, "How soon?"
For three years.

24:12.415 --> 24:14.383
But you kept on saying,

24:14.951 --> 24:17.920
"How soon?" even after you
were married to someone else?

24:19.856 --> 24:23.690
Well, after George was famous,

24:23.994 --> 24:26.519
I started reading about
somebody I didn't know.

24:26.963 --> 24:29.693
Cancelled performances,
bar fights,

24:29.766 --> 24:31.393
and the phone calls.

24:31.468 --> 24:33.732
He sounded so different.

24:35.038 --> 24:36.699
So important, I guess.

24:37.174 --> 24:41.611
I really thought that he'd
just meet somebody else
and forget me.

24:42.112 --> 24:43.340
But he didn't.

24:45.215 --> 24:46.204
Okay.

24:51.788 --> 24:56.122
But after you were married
to Desmond. Why the charade?

24:56.693 --> 25:00.720
Apparently you convinced
Jessup that he could only
reach you

25:00.797 --> 25:03.265
at this one phone
and only on Saturday nights?

25:04.267 --> 25:06.633
He trusted me. I...

25:07.470 --> 25:09.404
He believed if
whatever I told him.

25:09.472 --> 25:11.736
I didn't know
how to destroy that trust.

25:12.375 --> 25:14.104
Or maybe you didn't want to.

25:16.179 --> 25:17.806
I did love him.

25:34.531 --> 25:36.158
They're really beautiful.

25:41.571 --> 25:42.868
I'll miss them.

25:48.979 --> 25:50.571
What about the letter?

25:54.150 --> 25:56.675
I just didn't want Des
to ever see it.

26:02.692 --> 26:04.523
He probably wouldn't have...

26:04.861 --> 26:06.328
Wouldn't have minded.

26:56.046 --> 26:57.308
Here they are, Billy.

27:03.119 --> 27:05.883
<i>You know</i>
<i>the chances of ever</i>
<i>retrieving them are minimal.</i>

27:06.790 --> 27:08.815
I have a very
short list of suspects.

27:08.892 --> 27:10.189
Billy Cockrell.

27:10.393 --> 27:12.088
Rick's checking out
the license.

27:12.162 --> 27:14.995
If I'm lucky, it'll be
a rental in Billy's name.

27:15.432 --> 27:18.697
Look, are you sure
that Lacy said he was
going back to Pearl?

27:18.768 --> 27:21.635
Because I'm gonna call
the security gate and see
if they'll go find him.

27:21.705 --> 27:23.798
Lacy will know
what's happened
soon enough.

27:23.873 --> 27:26.637
Isn't there someone else
who should be notified first?

27:27.610 --> 27:30.272
She now runs
a great danger
of being exposed.

27:30.814 --> 27:34.079
She should have
the opportunity to explain
to her husband.

27:46.863 --> 27:48.660
Crane residence. Tanaka.

27:49.632 --> 27:50.758
Lieutenant?

27:50.934 --> 27:52.060
Magnum?

27:53.403 --> 27:56.270
I was calling for Mrs. Crane.
Why are you answering
the phone?

27:56.339 --> 27:57.567
<i>Because she can't.</i>

27:58.341 --> 27:59.865
Get over here, Magnum.

28:00.510 --> 28:05.106
I want to know the details
of your business with
the late Laurie Crane.

28:15.072 --> 28:17.336
A neighbor heard a shot
and called us.

28:17.408 --> 28:19.342
We notified him
at the office.

28:19.777 --> 28:21.802
Why were you calling her,
Magnum?

28:23.581 --> 28:25.344
I'm sorry, Mr. Crane.

28:25.683 --> 28:26.707
Yes.

28:26.784 --> 28:28.411
I imagine you would be.

28:29.353 --> 28:34.120
Tell me, were those songs
really worth Laurie's life?

28:34.659 --> 28:37.219
There is no reason to think
there's any connection

28:37.294 --> 28:39.922
between what happened
and the search for
these songs.

28:40.231 --> 28:42.699
Well, why don't we let
the police decide that.

28:43.401 --> 28:45.961
Now where's Lacy Fletcher
and that publisher?

28:46.203 --> 28:49.070
Are we by any chance
discussing clients of yours?

28:50.808 --> 28:52.241
A client, Lieutenant.

28:52.309 --> 28:55.472
Yes, and Lacy did hire me
to find Laurie Crane, but...

28:55.546 --> 28:58.071
He hired you to harass her

28:58.149 --> 29:01.380
into admitting
that she was having
an affair with a singer.

29:02.219 --> 29:04.449
He had her so upset.
- No!

29:04.855 --> 29:06.550
I did not harass her.

29:09.960 --> 29:12.554
Look, Mr. Crane,

29:12.963 --> 29:15.022
you don't know
the whole story about Lacy.

29:15.099 --> 29:18.591
If you did, you'd know
the last thing he'd want is
something to happen to Laurie.

29:19.170 --> 29:22.469
It's not that I question
your judgment of character,
Magnum,

29:22.940 --> 29:24.373
but where do I find him?

29:25.509 --> 29:29.036
He'll be at the estate
after you've finished
your questioning here.

29:30.581 --> 29:31.775
What?

29:32.216 --> 29:35.652
I mean, do you always work
until after 8 p.m.
At your office, Mr. Crane?

29:37.288 --> 29:39.586
Yes, as a matter of fact,
I do.

29:40.224 --> 29:41.714
When it's necessary.

29:41.792 --> 29:43.589
And was it necessary tonight?

29:43.961 --> 29:46.828
I mean, if she was
as upset as you say she was,

29:46.897 --> 29:48.364
shouldn't you have
been here with her?

29:48.432 --> 29:51.424
That's enough!
I can do my job
without help.

29:52.336 --> 29:54.896
And you and Fletcher
be around when I call.

30:03.547 --> 30:05.481
<i>It's done, Higgins.</i>

30:07.284 --> 30:09.912
Actually, it was a lot easier
than I expected.

30:10.855 --> 30:13.790
You did this entire score
this evening?

30:14.191 --> 30:15.488
Yeah, well, I...

30:17.394 --> 30:21.353
I needed something to get
my mind off of things.
She was such a...

30:23.667 --> 30:25.430
Such a sweet person.

30:27.071 --> 30:29.164
He got away with
murdering Georgie.

30:30.207 --> 30:32.505
I'm not gonna let him
get away with this.

30:32.576 --> 30:34.441
Do you really believe that?

30:36.313 --> 30:39.544
All that reading that you've
done on Georgie and you don't
know about Billy?

30:40.084 --> 30:43.542
Well, I've read most
everything written about
the accident, yes.

30:43.921 --> 30:45.548
Accident, hell!

30:45.990 --> 30:48.151
Lacy, I'm sorry,
but by your own accounts,

30:48.225 --> 30:51.524
Billy Cockrell was guilty
of nothing more than
an irresponsible act.

30:51.595 --> 30:54.621
Hey, listen, he knew
that there was no way that
we could get to Richmond

30:54.698 --> 30:57.724
with Georgie flying us.
He knew that.
He wanted it to happen.

30:59.837 --> 31:03.238
To my way of thinking,
that's just as much a murder
as what he done tonight.

31:03.307 --> 31:05.138
Why would he
kill her, Lacy?

31:06.477 --> 31:08.069
He already had the songs.

31:08.712 --> 31:09.736
Yeah.

31:10.581 --> 31:12.048
So Higgins told me.

31:12.883 --> 31:15.818
Thanks to you,
he's probably halfway
to Nashville by now.

31:16.253 --> 31:20.155
And thanks a lot for
sneaking off and seeing Laurie
without letting me know.

31:20.825 --> 31:22.520
What time did you see her?

31:22.760 --> 31:26.662
Magnum, Lacy was here
scoring his composition
since soon after you left.

31:26.831 --> 31:28.924
Except he didn't go
to Pearl today.

31:28.999 --> 31:31.433
They have no record
of him coming through
the security gate.

31:31.502 --> 31:32.901
Now, where were you, Lacy?

31:34.772 --> 31:36.433
Oh, come on, Lacy.

31:36.507 --> 31:38.873
Tanaka's talking to Crane
right now, then you're next.

31:38.943 --> 31:41.434
Now, I need some answers
before he gets here!

31:41.512 --> 31:43.503
Now what time
did you see Laurie Crane?

31:43.581 --> 31:45.845
It's a fact that
I was there, is it?

31:45.916 --> 31:46.974
Yes!

31:47.318 --> 31:49.878
Unless you can
produce that letter.
Unopened.

31:50.554 --> 31:53.717
Well, come on, Lacy.
You never let it
out of your sight!

31:57.561 --> 32:00.257
You really believe
that I could hurt her?

32:00.364 --> 32:02.093
She meant everything
to Georgie.

32:03.100 --> 32:06.729
I'll know more about
what I believe when you
tell me what happened.

32:08.272 --> 32:10.263
Well, you're gonna
have a long wait.

32:11.642 --> 32:14.076
Because the only proof I got
is still my word.

32:14.144 --> 32:15.941
You can take it or leave it.

32:18.515 --> 32:19.948
Sorry, Thomas.

32:20.551 --> 32:23.850
That limo's registered
to a Lem Tomkins
up the north shore.

32:23.921 --> 32:25.912
Exit your
Billy Cockrell theory.

32:26.657 --> 32:27.851
What's the address?

32:27.925 --> 32:29.916
You don't wanna go there.
Come on, Rick.

32:29.994 --> 32:31.985
Okay. Fine.
But count me out.

32:32.062 --> 32:35.225

a nice kid from Chicago

as big and mean-Iooking
with red hair.

33:28.686 --> 33:31.553
Well, there are about
six guys and three women
that fit that description.

33:31.622 --> 33:34.182
Over 50, and he's almost
always in a suit.

33:34.858 --> 33:37.986
Listen, oh, there's
one more thing
I should explain...

33:40.397 --> 33:42.558
Where's Rick?
Rick? Rick who?

33:42.633 --> 33:45.033
T.C., come on!
Come on, T. C!
Come on, Cockrell,
where is he?

33:45.102 --> 33:46.330
What have you
done with him?

33:46.403 --> 33:48.371
No, no, no, no.
Wait a minute now!
Come on!

33:49.807 --> 33:52.742
They don't have Rick.
I lied. I made it up.
I'm sorry.

33:52.810 --> 33:55.210
Now give me
the songs, Billy!
The songs?

33:55.279 --> 33:56.712
You told me
they kidnapped Rick

33:56.780 --> 33:59.613
just so you could send me
on a wild goose chase
over those stupid...

33:59.683 --> 34:01.878
No, T.C., they're real!
Real?

34:02.820 --> 34:04.583
Then you conned me
here as backup.

34:04.655 --> 34:06.520
No, I don't need a backup.

34:06.590 --> 34:08.614
Because Billy's gonna
give me those songs.

34:08.692 --> 34:09.920
Right, Billy?

34:09.994 --> 34:12.292
Hey, come on,
I didn't mean for those guys
to rough you up.

34:12.362 --> 34:14.763
In fact,
I told them not to!
Just give me the songs!

34:14.831 --> 34:16.697
Yes, and they had
better be real!

34:16.766 --> 34:20.203

backup con for nothing...
I don't need a backup, T.C.

34:20.270 --> 34:21.760

35:19.763 --> 35:22.960
Yeah, yeah.
There's Jessup's name on
the top of all of them.

35:26.637 --> 35:30.129
Georgie couldn't write
that high-class eighth
and quarter note stuff.

35:30.207 --> 35:32.368
He used the Nashville
Number System.

35:32.643 --> 35:34.474
Any expert would
laugh you out of the room

36:15.285 --> 36:16.343
I...

36:17.521 --> 36:19.421
I suppose he went on to bed.

36:19.490 --> 36:22.618
I just checked his room.
He's not there,
and all his stuff's gone.

36:24.194 --> 36:25.627
Well, I don't understand.

36:25.696 --> 36:28.358
We were listening
to yesterday's
quartet rehearsal.

36:30.067 --> 36:31.364
Jessup's songs?

36:33.003 --> 36:34.095
I don't know.

36:34.505 --> 36:37.065
Did you ever hear of
the Nashville Number System?

36:38.642 --> 36:40.200
Well, yes, of course.

36:40.277 --> 36:44.441
It's a very simple
method of musical notation

36:44.515 --> 36:45.846
created by...

36:47.284 --> 36:49.980
By country writers
who couldn't read music?

36:50.420 --> 36:52.047
Like George Lee Jessup.

36:59.096 --> 37:01.929
But the chord patterns
are vintage Jessup.

37:01.999 --> 37:03.523
They're unmistakable.

37:03.834 --> 37:05.324
Or vintage Fletcher?

37:11.089 --> 37:14.115
You looked for him
on the hospital grounds,
of course?

37:14.292 --> 37:17.728
He hasn't been there.
I've checked hotels,
all-night bars.

37:18.196 --> 37:21.324
I don't know.
Maybe he took a red-eye
back to Nashville.

37:21.533 --> 37:25.629
Lieutenant Tanaka
was quite upset to find
both you and Lacy gone.

37:25.837 --> 37:29.568
He cryptically assured me
that you should not feel
alone in your search.

37:29.641 --> 37:32.269
Come on, he put out
an APB on Lacy?

37:32.344 --> 37:34.403
Magnum, Lacy's fingerprints
were all over the room

37:34.479 --> 37:35.878
where Laurie Crane
was murdered.

37:35.947 --> 37:38.279
Okay, fine, Higgins,
he was there!

37:38.350 --> 37:40.011
He wanted to give her
the letter.

37:40.085 --> 37:44.078
But he certainly wouldn't
hurt the one person that
Jessup really cared for.

37:51.162 --> 37:52.220
No.

37:53.331 --> 37:55.891
A very complete
and complex devotion.

37:57.135 --> 38:01.265
Odd that the fifth song
should be missing from
so cherished a collection.

38:01.339 --> 38:03.933
I'm more interested in why
that letter is missing.

38:05.910 --> 38:09.311
Well, its disposition
hardly seems important
under the circumstances.

38:09.381 --> 38:10.473
Higgins,

38:10.849 --> 38:15.149
whoever killed her thought
it was very important or
it wouldn't have disappeared.

38:15.220 --> 38:17.188
She told you the letter
was nothing more

38:17.255 --> 38:20.224
than a rambling confession
to Jessup about her marriage.

38:20.292 --> 38:21.281
Right.

38:22.994 --> 38:26.794
But did she ever confess
the whole thing to the guy
she was married to?

38:27.632 --> 38:29.361
It doesn't matter
what she confessed, Magnum.

38:29.434 --> 38:32.494
Crane did all the confessing
I can handle this morning.

38:34.572 --> 38:36.039
So you got him downtown?

38:36.341 --> 38:38.366
No. His story didn't add up.

38:38.443 --> 38:40.138
Details he couldn't cover.

38:40.211 --> 38:41.803
And the lamps and the tables,

38:41.880 --> 38:43.404
they were overturned
too neatly.

38:44.015 --> 38:45.915
I know a staged job
when I see one.

38:47.786 --> 38:50.414
And he finally broke
and told me the truth.

38:54.359 --> 38:57.487
Her letter to Jessup
must've been more brutal
than she remembered.

38:57.562 --> 38:59.257
She had a prior history.

38:59.998 --> 39:03.161
It was thoughtful
of your client
to drop it on her.

39:03.234 --> 39:04.667
But what can you expect?

39:04.736 --> 39:06.363
The guy's a real basket case.

39:06.438 --> 39:08.133
Nashville police report?

39:08.273 --> 39:09.865
Twelve counts of assault.

39:10.909 --> 39:12.809
And he even sings
on street corners.

39:13.211 --> 39:14.735
Lieutenant,
he sings everywhere.

39:14.813 --> 39:16.280
I mean, come on,
he's harmless.

39:16.348 --> 39:18.145
Look, all these counts
are related.

39:18.216 --> 39:21.413
He only goes after people
who are insulting
to George Lee.

39:25.457 --> 39:26.651
Where's Crane?

39:31.896 --> 39:33.090
Lacy?

39:33.164 --> 39:35.291
I'm over here, Crane!

39:42.974 --> 39:44.236
Believe me,

39:44.909 --> 39:49.141
you needed no cheap,
second letter blackmail lie
to meet with me.

39:49.214 --> 39:51.512
Well, I needed something
to get you out here.

39:51.583 --> 39:54.450
Where a good man
really loved the woman
that you murdered.

39:55.220 --> 39:56.710
You're accusing me?

39:56.788 --> 39:59.484
You and that letter,
that's why Laurie's dead.

39:59.758 --> 40:03.091
She finally stopped blaming
herself until you came along.

40:03.628 --> 40:05.255
And then she had to...

40:05.330 --> 40:09.323
Then she had to remember
what she had written
to that drunken, trashy...

40:13.171 --> 40:14.160
Here.

40:15.807 --> 40:17.866
She couldn't part
with that one.

40:18.510 --> 40:22.571
Why the hell did you have
to come looking for those
childish, maudlin songs?

40:24.182 --> 40:28.710
You read Georgie's letter...
Private letter?

40:36.795 --> 40:38.353
I didn't have to read it.

40:38.430 --> 40:41.729
I knew about the affair
from the night she wrote
that letter to Jessup.

40:41.800 --> 40:43.859
You didn't know
till last night,

40:43.935 --> 40:47.393
and you couldn't stand
to find out that she loved
Georgie more than you.

40:48.940 --> 40:51.602
We were married a whole year
before that plane crash.

40:51.676 --> 40:54.201
That's a lie!
She was coming
to marry Georgie.

40:54.279 --> 40:56.611
Me! She was married to me!

40:57.148 --> 40:58.479
But she blamed herself.

40:58.550 --> 41:00.040
Because she thought

41:00.118 --> 41:03.246
that he was drunk that night
because she said no to him.

41:03.321 --> 41:04.549
That's a lie!

41:04.622 --> 41:06.522
You read the letter
and couldn't take it!

41:06.591 --> 41:08.616
She didn't even
remember his name.

41:08.693 --> 41:10.388
I actually convinced her

41:10.662 --> 41:12.254
that she never met him.

41:12.330 --> 41:13.627
She loved Georgie.

41:13.698 --> 41:14.926
She was Georgie's.

41:14.999 --> 41:16.193
She was mine!

41:23.141 --> 41:24.608
Lacy, stop!

41:25.243 --> 41:27.404
Leave us alone!
He killed her.

41:27.479 --> 41:28.571
No!

41:29.113 --> 41:30.512
It was suicide.

41:34.786 --> 41:36.686
This time I wasn't
there to stop her.

41:38.923 --> 41:41.619
So you destroyed the letter

41:41.693 --> 41:43.923
and made it look like
she was murdered,
Desmond. Why?

41:47.298 --> 41:49.960
Laurie didn't deserve
the scandal of suicide.

41:51.202 --> 41:52.692
It wasn't her fault.

41:54.339 --> 41:55.829
It wasn't her fault?

41:58.977 --> 42:00.877
Will the two of you just stop?

42:02.347 --> 42:04.076
Look what you're
doing to yourselves.

42:04.148 --> 42:05.809
You'd stand here
and kill each other

42:05.884 --> 42:07.943
before you'd admit
that those two weren't saints!

42:10.221 --> 42:11.483
Desmond,

42:13.658 --> 42:15.626
Laurie had real
emotional problems.

42:15.693 --> 42:17.558
You're just gonna
have to accept that.

42:18.463 --> 42:19.828
And live with it.

42:21.466 --> 42:22.694
And, Lacy...

42:24.269 --> 42:25.930
I mean,
can you even remember

42:26.170 --> 42:28.638
that you're the real talent
behind Jessup?

42:28.907 --> 42:30.465
You wrote all those hits.

42:31.109 --> 42:33.339
No, no, they was Georgie's.

42:33.411 --> 42:36.608
Fine, fine.
So you don't want
the truth known.

42:36.681 --> 42:38.945
But at least
admit it to yourself.

42:39.784 --> 42:42.480
I got the other four
from Billy.
They're all the same.

43:00.805 --> 43:02.773
Five million shot to hell.

43:06.311 --> 43:09.940
Well, there goes
the museum, Georgie.

43:10.481 --> 43:11.709
A museum?

43:13.484 --> 43:16.078
Don't you think
you've done enough
for Georgie?

43:18.823 --> 43:20.552
No, you can't do enough.

43:22.994 --> 43:24.689
He was special.

43:25.797 --> 43:26.786
Special.

43:29.434 --> 43:33.165
That's why that he needed
special songs.

43:34.305 --> 43:36.500
Songs that he wrote
himself, so...

43:42.447 --> 43:45.314
So people would know
that he was singing
from the heart.

43:47.585 --> 43:48.847
Oh, well.

43:51.589 --> 43:52.886
If he'd just

43:55.360 --> 43:59.353
copied the first ones
like I thought he did,
like we'd done all the rest,

44:01.633 --> 44:03.498
they'd all be monsters.

44:06.104 --> 44:08.732
Instead of my useless tunes.

44:10.074 --> 44:11.701
Doesn't that kind of

44:12.510 --> 44:14.876
say something about
how special he was?

44:15.813 --> 44:16.973
Hmm?

44:22.987 --> 44:24.614
They were both special.

44:59.057 --> 45:02.322
Lacy, they could all be
chartbusters if you'd
just listen to reason.

45:02.393 --> 45:04.953
You mind holding it down?
I'm trying to listen
to my piece. Do you mind?

45:05.029 --> 45:08.260
Lacy, come on now.
Billy's trying to end the war.
What do you want?

45:08.332 --> 45:09.890
Nothing,
not from him.

45:09.967 --> 45:11.298
Yeah, well,
you're gonna get it.

45:11.369 --> 45:14.031
I wanna record
those songs and give you
all the royalties.

45:14.105 --> 45:15.538
But you gotta do them
as Lacy Fletcher tunes.

45:15.606 --> 45:18.734
Over my dead body.
You're trying to make
a fool out of Georgie.

45:18.810 --> 45:22.439
No, damn it,
I'm just trying to make
things up to him and you!

45:22.513 --> 45:24.606
Guys, come on.
Everyone can hear you. Please.

45:27.185 --> 45:30.177
The money from those songs
could build that museum
you want.

45:32.457 --> 45:34.721
And if it don't, I'll put in
the rest of the money.

45:34.792 --> 45:36.851
But I want to do them
as your songs, Lacy.

45:36.928 --> 45:39.158
I won't see you lie
for Georgie anymore.

45:49.407 --> 45:51.068
Ladies and gentlemen,

45:51.142 --> 45:52.769
it is a great honor

45:52.877 --> 45:56.711
to present the composer
of the beautiful piece
we have just premiered.

45:57.148 --> 45:59.048
Mr. Lacy Fletcher.

46:10.661 --> 46:12.891
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

46:13.197 --> 46:16.894
I know this isn't exactly
the place for country, but...

46:19.203 --> 46:23.537
I got another little
premiere here for you,
if you don't mind.

46:23.908 --> 46:26.877
This is one of
five songs that...

46:28.012 --> 46:30.572
Well, they're all gonna
be classics because

46:31.883 --> 46:36.343
they were all written by
the great George Lee Jessup.

46:37.855 --> 46:41.814
And I had the wonderful
privilege of writing down
the notes for him.
