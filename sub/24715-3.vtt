00:01.001 --> 00:02.836
ANDY: <i>Previously on </i>NYPD Blue.

00:02.919 --> 00:04.421
Lieutenant Rodriguez, Maria Oliveira.

00:04.546 --> 00:06.798
Why wasn't I notified before my mother
was taken to the hospital?

00:07.007 --> 00:08.717
It's Hector Acevedo.
I know she's your mother,

00:08.925 --> 00:10.927
but this is my case.
I can't let you look for him alone.

00:11.803 --> 00:15.515
Did you break in on my mother,
or are you a dead man? Go to the car!

00:15.765 --> 00:17.559
-I'm staying here.
-Go to the car!

00:17.684 --> 00:19.769
You received two complaints,
for excessive force

00:19.853 --> 00:22.397
-when you were in narcotics, right?
-You're in the field as much as I was,

00:22.480 --> 00:24.566
you ruffle a few feathers,
it goes with the territory.

00:24.774 --> 00:26.651
Another complaint
when you were in uniform.

00:27.068 --> 00:30.113
-Goes with the territory, right?
-I was never disciplined for anything,

00:30.196 --> 00:32.323
and I'd put my record up
against any cops.

00:43.501 --> 00:45.879
Mr. Acevedo,
where do you presently reside?

00:45.962 --> 00:47.547
Green Haven Correctional Facility.

00:47.756 --> 00:51.051
-And what are you incarcerated for?
-Burglary, robbery, assault.

00:51.426 --> 00:54.971
-And who was the arresting officer?
-Anthony Rodriguez.

00:55.263 --> 00:57.390
JAMES: Could you describe
the circumstances of that arrest?

00:57.557 --> 01:01.019
Yeah, he busted into my apartment,
he accused me of breaking in on his mom.

01:01.269 --> 01:03.605
-And what happened then?
-He stuck a gun in my face,

01:03.688 --> 01:05.690
said if I didn't confess,
that I'd be a dead man.

01:05.982 --> 01:08.693
-Did you confess at that time?
-As fast as I could.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.571
That wasn't your first contact
with Lieutenant Rodriguez, was it?

01:11.988 --> 01:16.701
No, he arrested me in '93
for selling crack. I served eight years.

01:16.826 --> 01:19.204
JAMES: Mr. Acevedo, were you guilty
of all the crimes

01:19.329 --> 01:21.039
-you've been convicted of?
-Yes, I was.

01:21.289 --> 01:23.833
Lieutenant Rodriguez
put you in jail twice.

01:24.042 --> 01:28.254
Can you see why your testimony here today
might be viewed with some skepticism?

01:28.505 --> 01:30.215
Look, I'm paying for what I did.

01:30.673 --> 01:31.674
And I'm owning up.

01:31.758 --> 01:34.219
And what I'm saying happened,
really happened, okay.

01:34.677 --> 01:37.013
Whatever bad things I've done in my life,
I'm sorry.

01:37.097 --> 01:40.642
A cop shoving a gun in my face,
in my house, that's wrong too.

01:40.892 --> 01:42.936
Thank you. No further questions.

01:43.478 --> 01:44.562
JUDGE: Your witness.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.232
Mr. Acevedo...

01:48.900 --> 01:51.361
you say you confessed
because Lieutenant Rodriguez

01:51.486 --> 01:53.655
-threatened to kill you, correct?
-That's right.

01:53.988 --> 01:55.824
Did you challenge
that confession in court?

01:55.907 --> 01:56.991
No.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.285
Let's talk about
why you're testifying now.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.579
-Were you subpoenaed to appear?
-No.

02:01.788 --> 02:04.332
-Then how'd you come to be here?
-I read about the case.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.751
I wrote a letter to Mr. Sinclair,

02:06.835 --> 02:09.379
and I said I had information
that he might find useful.

02:09.712 --> 02:13.007
So, you're here out of your devotion
to the legal process?

02:13.258 --> 02:15.135
-Objection.
-Withdrawn.

02:15.927 --> 02:18.847
Any chance you might be harboring
a little ill will?

02:19.097 --> 02:22.142
Nothing that would make me
lie in this court today.

02:22.267 --> 02:26.229
Of course not. Convictions
for drug dealing, robbery, assault.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.815
Lying's not consistent
with that moral code.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.775
-Objection.
-JUDGE: Sustained.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.696
-Nothing further.
-You can step down, Mr. Acevedo.

02:35.113 --> 02:37.031
Call your next witness, Mr. Sinclair.

02:37.782 --> 02:40.368
The defense calls
Detective Maria Olivera.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.706
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

02:47.750 --> 02:49.752
-Sidebar, Your Honor.
-Approach.

02:57.552 --> 02:59.804
The prosecution requests an offer of proof

02:59.888 --> 03:02.223
as to the substance
of this witness's testimony.

03:02.640 --> 03:06.603
Detective Oliveira was in the room
with Lieutenant Rodriguez and Mr. Acevedo.

03:06.686 --> 03:08.021
She's a corroborating witness.

03:08.354 --> 03:10.940
Judge, the jury has already heard
from Mr. Acevedo.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.318
The detective will be offering
cumulative testimony

03:13.401 --> 03:14.527
on a collateral matter.

03:15.528 --> 03:19.449
The impeachment of Lieutenant Rodriguez
is hardly collateral.

03:20.658 --> 03:21.910
I'll allow it.

03:22.660 --> 03:25.246
I have a matter in another case,
so we'll take a brief recess.

03:25.496 --> 03:27.624
That should give you time
to get up to speed, Miss Heywood.

03:27.832 --> 03:29.125
Thank you, Your Honor.

03:29.876 --> 03:33.296
Court is adjourned until 11:30.

03:39.594 --> 03:40.637
What's up?

03:41.679 --> 03:44.349
You never said anything
about another detective being there

03:44.432 --> 03:45.475
for the Acevedo arrest.

03:45.683 --> 03:47.435
Oliveira, I didn't see
any reason to jam her up.

03:47.685 --> 03:50.188
She's jammed up, Tony.
She's been called to testify.

03:50.438 --> 03:54.150
She's not gonna corroborate Acevedo.
She's a stand-up cop, and there's no way.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.902
I don't want to hear
about how you think she'll lie

03:56.027 --> 03:59.781
to cover your ass because I hope you know
how bad a position that would put me in.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.784
I'm just telling you,
if she corroborates that witness,

04:02.867 --> 04:05.036
you'll look like a violent cop
who's quick to pull his gun,

04:05.119 --> 04:08.164
and I'll look like I'm prosecuting a guy
who acted in self-defense.

04:10.583 --> 04:11.626
I gotta go.

He had all he could do to moan.

Dan Spolen.

How well do you know Mr. Szudarek?

06:00.651 --> 06:03.071
I wish better,
but he's not a real neighborly type.

06:03.279 --> 06:04.614
How'd you come across him this morning?

06:04.864 --> 06:07.700
I was heading up
to read the paper on the roof.

06:07.784 --> 06:11.412
I have an outdoor set up there.
Chairs, umbrella.

06:11.788 --> 06:15.291
And I noticed his door was open,
so I knock, and I found him on the floor.

06:16.834 --> 06:18.544
-That's your apartment?
-Hmm.

06:20.755 --> 06:22.298
How did you see that the door was open?

06:25.968 --> 06:27.220
Just... did.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.598
Why did the color just drain
out of your face?

06:32.141 --> 06:35.186
I was going to the roof
to smoke a cigarette.

06:36.104 --> 06:38.106
I'm not supposed to,
but once in a while...

06:38.189 --> 06:39.899
That doesn't explain what
you're doing down there.

06:40.608 --> 06:44.779
I keep the cigarettes in there,
and mouthwash, and hand sanitizer.

this detective from the 8-3,

-a Maria Oliveira.
-Yeah, I know that name.

assaulted, she caught the case.

the confession off that guy.

-Yeah.
-That ain't good.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.669
And I guess it kind of took Valerie
by surprise.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.797
What do we have on that assault case?

07:44.881 --> 07:46.924
Victim's at Bellevue. He should make it.

He had an interview at E.N.L.

08:10.072 --> 08:11.657
and I called, but he never showed up.

08:12.074 --> 08:14.619
His name's Troy Miner,

08:15.077 --> 08:17.288
and he's not answering

-ANDREA: Thirty.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.959
And, no, there's not some hoe on the side,

08:22.043 --> 08:24.879
and no, he's not in a gang,
and no, he does not have a drug

08:24.962 --> 08:26.839
or an alcohol or a gambling problem.

08:27.215 --> 08:30.051
He's a family man.
And there's definitely something wrong.

08:30.510 --> 08:34.180
Well, seeing as he's an adult,
and it's been less than 48 hours.

08:34.430 --> 08:36.599
-Well, can you just take my word for it?
-I'm just telling you that we can't take

08:36.849 --> 08:38.684
an official missing person's report.

08:38.851 --> 08:41.354
-But we will look into it.
-ANDREA: I'd really appreciate that.

Um, the last number I put on there
is Troy's cousin, Corey Mack.

to mix Troy up in something.

but they won't let me talk to him.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.432
Well, he's still being treated.

So, I came back here to keep busy,
but I can't open up.

09:22.353 --> 09:23.396
It's disrespectful.

09:23.896 --> 09:29.360
-Sure. We got some questions about Ron.
-Good guy. Didn't deserve this.

09:29.610 --> 09:31.153

that would want to hurt him?

-You two close?
-Yeah, knew Ron a long time.

-Everyone liked him.

-He owe money?
-No.

-He got a drug problem?
-Come on, you're totally off.

We're off? This isn't 20 questions, Bob.
What's going on?

09:48.462 --> 09:49.714
I'm sorry.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.676
I was thinking of taking care
of this problem on my own,

09:53.884 --> 09:54.927
and at the same time,

09:55.011 --> 09:56.929
hoping that someone would
come along to stop me.

09:57.138 --> 09:59.682
-You're just not quite getting it.
-Yeah, well, give us a hand.

09:59.890 --> 10:03.227
You want to talk to our landlady,
all right? Doris Vidi.

10:03.769 --> 10:06.063
She upped the rent a couple months ago,
trying to get us out.

10:06.397 --> 10:07.607
How heated did it get?

10:07.773 --> 10:09.233
BOB: Well, there was a lot of yelling
on the phone.

10:09.317 --> 10:10.359
Yeah well, how'd that get to torture?

10:10.651 --> 10:12.194
She's an old hatchet-faced guinea.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.530
She's got a pair of degenerate sons.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.866
They collect every month.
I can see them doing it.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.328
'Cause he was beat worse
than a rent dispute.

10:26.500 --> 10:29.045
These brothers, this is who you're gonna
pay a visit to if we hadn't come along?

10:29.670 --> 10:31.756
With a bat in my right hand
and a pipe in my left.

10:31.839 --> 10:33.966
Yeah, but you're not going to now,
'cause I'm gonna have to take you in.

10:36.385 --> 10:38.095
Yeah, if I keep busy, I'll be fine.

10:38.429 --> 10:41.599

with Mr. Acevedo,

10:48.731 --> 10:51.525
which was conducted by yourself
and a fellow detective,

10:51.651 --> 10:53.694
did Mr. Acevedo confess?

10:53.861 --> 10:56.197
-No.
-Why was the interview ended?

10:56.364 --> 10:58.866
It was time to regroup,
so we released Mr. Acevedo.

10:58.949 --> 11:00.034
And how would you characterize

11:00.117 --> 11:02.536
the progress of your investigation
at that point?

11:02.745 --> 11:05.122
We felt we had our guy,
and it was just gonna take some time.

11:05.206 --> 11:08.918
What was Mr. Rodriguez's reaction
when you told him that the main suspect

11:09.001 --> 11:11.545
in the assault on his mother
was walking out the door?

11:13.214 --> 11:15.257
He was a little frustrated,
which was understandable.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.885
When did you see Mr. Acevedo again?

11:18.219 --> 11:20.805
At his apartment in Brooklyn,
later that afternoon.

11:21.430 --> 11:24.016
With whom did you go
to Mr. Acevedo's apartment?

11:24.141 --> 11:25.309
Lieutenant Rodriguez.

11:25.476 --> 11:28.104
How did you gain entry
into Mr. Acevedo's apartment?

11:28.521 --> 11:29.939
We knocked on the door. He let us in.

11:31.857 --> 11:34.026
-He let you in?
-Yes.

11:34.151 --> 11:36.737
At that time, did Mr. Acevedo
confess to the assault

11:36.821 --> 11:39.156
-on Lieutenant Rodriguez's mother?
-Eventually, yes.

11:39.323 --> 11:43.536
Did Lieutenant Rodriguez
threaten Mr. Acevedo's life

11:43.703 --> 11:46.789
-in order to obtain that confession?
-No, he did not.

11:47.665 --> 11:51.043
You didn't hear Lieutenant Rodriguez
tell Mr. Acevedo,

11:51.252 --> 11:53.295
"You're a dead man. I'll kill you,"

11:53.379 --> 11:56.340
all the while with a gun
in Mr. Acevedo's throat?

11:56.424 --> 11:57.800
Objection. Leading.

11:58.050 --> 12:02.430
Your Honor, permission to treat
Detective Oliveira as a hostile witness.

12:02.596 --> 12:04.056
JUDGE: Go ahead, Mr. Sinclair.

12:04.473 --> 12:05.725
The witness can answer.

12:06.392 --> 12:08.227
Lieutenant Rodriguez
never said any of that.

12:08.352 --> 12:11.355
Lieutenant Rodriguez,
who was interviewing a suspect

12:11.647 --> 12:16.360
he believed assaulted his mom,
was what? Calm?

12:16.485 --> 12:17.486
He was professional.

12:17.820 --> 12:21.031
Are you asking us to believe
that Hector Acevedo,

12:21.115 --> 12:22.783
certainly no stranger to the legal system,

12:23.367 --> 12:26.245
suddenly and spontaneously gave it up?

12:26.620 --> 12:29.081
We convinced him a confession
would get him favorable treatment.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.083
Oh, that's all it took.

12:31.292 --> 12:35.129
A common, lame tactic
about favorable treatment

12:35.504 --> 12:38.549
that Mr. Acevedo has doubtless heard
a million times,

12:38.841 --> 12:42.094
and knows firsthand, is not true.

12:42.178 --> 12:45.681
Objection. I don't recall that
testimony from Mr. Acevedo.

12:46.098 --> 12:48.559
-Sustained.
-Detective...

12:50.186 --> 12:52.104
have you ever heard
of the blue wall of silence?

12:52.229 --> 12:54.315
Cops backing up cops,
regardless of the truth?

12:54.607 --> 12:56.108
-Objection.
-I'll allow it.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.154
I've testified to how
it went down, counselor.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.283
If you say so, detective.

13:06.660 --> 13:08.120
No further questions.

13:19.381 --> 13:22.551
-So your cousin Troy, you two were tight.
-Yeah.

13:23.302 --> 13:25.846
His wife Andrea came in,
wanted to report him as missing.

13:26.180 --> 13:27.807
Oh, yeah, she called me about that.

13:28.140 --> 13:31.101
-You heard from him?
-No, I don't know where that fool's at.

13:31.185 --> 13:34.271
Hey, Corey, seeing as we're looking
to help you find your cousin,

13:34.355 --> 13:36.607
and we're not looking to jam
either of the two of you up.

13:37.358 --> 13:41.278
You think it's possible that we could have
a little honest conversation here, Corey?

13:41.445 --> 13:42.655
Oh, absolutely, that's possible.

13:42.905 --> 13:46.450
'Cause we'd rather clear this up with you
before we have to go back to Troy's wife

13:46.575 --> 13:48.953
and ask her questions
maybe she doesn't wanna hear.

13:49.161 --> 13:52.039
-Yeah, that's cool.
-Okay, then, so what's going on?

13:52.373 --> 13:53.749
I don't know where Troy is.

13:54.041 --> 13:56.085
He got fired from his job two months ago.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.921
-COREY: Yeah.
-He got a DWI three months ago.

13:59.004 --> 14:01.048
Yeah, coming back from a birthday party.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.675
That's how he ended up losing his job.

14:02.758 --> 14:04.552
JOHN JR.: So he's got a wife,
two kids at home,

14:04.760 --> 14:06.637
he's out of work
for the first time in his life.

14:07.054 --> 14:09.098
Wouldn't be unheard of for a guy
in that situation

14:09.181 --> 14:11.976
-to lose his way a little.
-Drinking, drugs, leaving town?

14:13.853 --> 14:14.979
Let's hear it, Corey.

14:15.938 --> 14:18.148
Troy... (SIGHS)

14:19.817 --> 14:23.153
He got himself a girl on the side.
My guess, that's where he's at.

14:23.279 --> 14:26.115
-Who's the chick?
-He met her on one of his deliveries.

14:26.615 --> 14:28.659
(LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY)

14:28.868 --> 14:32.913
Oh, sorry, man. You gotta know Troy.
I mean, he has no game at all.

14:32.997 --> 14:35.583
That's why I could see him pulling
a rookie move, like not coming home.

14:35.833 --> 14:39.670
That's real funny and all, Corey,
but we've been spending time on this.

14:39.962 --> 14:42.006
-Oh, no, I got you.
-And Troy's wife,

14:42.172 --> 14:44.758
she's operating under the assumption
that Troy's a family man.

14:45.134 --> 14:48.971
He'll turn up, all right?
He's just out getting some new ass.

14:49.096 --> 14:50.973
If you were married to Andrea,
you would too.

14:51.056 --> 14:52.725
All right, if we don't hear
from him today,

14:52.808 --> 14:54.435
the next time his wife
pushes us for an answer,

14:54.518 --> 14:55.519
She's gonna get one.

14:55.769 --> 14:57.146
All right, just hold off
on that for a minute.

14:57.229 --> 14:58.814
I'll make some phone calls. He'll turn up.

14:59.064 --> 15:00.190
Get on it.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.489
-(TELEPHONE RINGING)
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

15:10.492 --> 15:11.994
TONY: You talk to Szudarek's landlady?

15:12.494 --> 15:15.331
Yeah. Doris Vidi. Battle-ax.

15:16.457 --> 15:19.418
She barely gave us the time of day,
and then she nearly threw a lamp at us

15:19.627 --> 15:21.211
when we asked for a place
to look for her sons.

15:21.337 --> 15:22.296
Her sons?

15:22.379 --> 15:24.924
Yeah, who Szudarek's employee
thinks did the dirty work.

15:25.174 --> 15:27.801
They both got records for assault,
but no answer at either apartments.

15:29.345 --> 15:31.931
The hospital. Szudarek's awake,
apparently lucid.

15:32.097 --> 15:33.223
-(TELEPHONE RINGING)
-(PAGER RINGING)

15:33.641 --> 15:35.184
TONY: You talk to that
missing guy's cousin?

15:35.476 --> 15:38.145
Yeah, he's pretty sure
this Troy's out dipping his wick.

15:38.312 --> 15:40.272
He's gonna reach out, get Troy back home.

15:40.606 --> 15:41.607
Lieutenant...

15:43.108 --> 15:44.777
We'll head to the hospital,
talk to Szudarek.

15:44.860 --> 15:47.446
Good. And uh, keep working
on the landlady's sons.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.198
BALDWIN: You got it.

15:53.702 --> 15:54.745
So, uh...

15:54.828 --> 15:56.497
Medavoy, whatever
you're about to bring up, don't.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.875
GREG: I was just gonna ask
if anyone had tried

15:59.959 --> 16:02.962
-the new Chinese place at 9th and 2nd.
-Uh-huh.

16:05.673 --> 16:09.051
But if I was gonna bring up the fact
that Oliveira did the right thing

16:09.134 --> 16:11.303
on the stand today, that's my prerogative.

16:11.428 --> 16:14.014
But since you were gonna ask
about the Chinese restaurant,

16:14.098 --> 16:15.891
and nobody's been there, end of chat.

16:16.433 --> 16:19.395
What is so wrong with me talking
about what everybody's thinking?

16:19.478 --> 16:22.815
-Because it's picking a scab.
-It's airing it out.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.985
You know, your censorship
is starting to rankle me, Andy.

16:26.068 --> 16:28.320
-Then quit picking the scab.
-All right, guys.

16:36.537 --> 16:39.415
Andrea Miner was just
assaulted in her apartment.

16:42.626 --> 16:44.420
-What's up?
-Nothing.

16:52.428 --> 16:55.097
-All right, give us a minute here.
-What happened?

16:55.723 --> 16:59.018
These guys pushed me in
when I was opening the door,

16:59.351 --> 17:00.894
pushed me right down on the floor,

17:01.311 --> 17:03.105
and then they yelled at me,
"Where's Troy?"

17:03.188 --> 17:04.648
And I told 'em I didn't know.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.651
And then they started yelling
to get Troy on the phone,

17:07.735 --> 17:10.362
and I told 'em I didn't know,
and so they started hitting me.

17:10.446 --> 17:13.032
-And you've never seen these guys before?
-No. Never.

17:13.282 --> 17:16.326
-Anything else happen before they left?
-They said to tell Troy when he calls

17:16.410 --> 17:19.288
that he needs to contact
who he needs to contact, or I'm dead.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.207
-What's going on?
-JOHN JR.: We don't know, Andrea,

17:22.416 --> 17:25.294
-'cause none of this is making any sense.
-Did you talk to his cousin Corey?

17:25.502 --> 17:27.838
He seems to think this might
involve another woman.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.466
Trust me, Troy's a family man.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.676
Family men don't disappear,
leaving their wives

17:32.760 --> 17:34.720
to get knocked around
by thugs looking for him.

17:36.346 --> 17:37.931
JOHN JR.: Do you see how this looks to us?

17:38.140 --> 17:42.227
Just talk to Corey, okay?
I know he's behind this.

17:42.394 --> 17:43.479
Okay.

17:44.563 --> 17:46.273
We're gonna get Troy's cell phone records.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.233
We're also gonna need a look
around the apartment.

17:48.358 --> 17:49.318
I know my man.

17:50.486 --> 17:53.155
-He's not out there with another woman.
-Yeah, all right.

17:58.535 --> 18:00.245
I was just walking in my place.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.748
Suddenly, there's a pillowcase
over my head.

18:03.248 --> 18:07.419
A guy's wrapping tape around it.
Gagging me, shoving me in the apartment.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.089
-Get a look at the guy?
-It was all too quick.

18:10.255 --> 18:13.175
-What happened next?
-They take me to the chair,

18:13.884 --> 18:17.471
then they start in, "Where's the cash?"
I'm like, "What cash?"

18:17.679 --> 18:19.640
And you're saying that
'cause you don't want 'em to rob you or?

18:19.723 --> 18:20.808
I got no cash.

18:21.016 --> 18:22.976
-And you don't owe anybody?
-No.

18:23.268 --> 18:25.562
Then where's someone got
the idea you got cash around?

18:25.813 --> 18:30.275
Maybe I let the occasional idiot
think I got a wad to take 'em down a peg.

18:30.359 --> 18:31.985
Well, so, you're a big talker.

18:33.195 --> 18:35.531
You sayin' I brought this on myself?

18:35.781 --> 18:37.032
Just getting things straight.

18:37.825 --> 18:40.285
How many guys were
involved here, Mr. Szudarek?

18:40.494 --> 18:41.954
Two was beating on me.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.248
Then there was the pussy.

18:45.290 --> 18:49.211
-The pussy?
-Yeah, kept back. Whined a lot.

18:49.419 --> 18:51.922
So, he was trying to reason
with these guys, the third guy?

18:52.214 --> 18:54.508
The others just kept telling him
to shut up.

18:55.342 --> 18:57.136
I nearly told him to shut up.

18:57.302 --> 19:00.305
You ever talk to your landlady's sons,
Tommy and Paul Vidi?

19:00.556 --> 19:02.850
No, no, no, no. These were Black guys.

19:03.308 --> 19:06.895
"Yo," and "G,"
and "know what I'm sayin'?" Black stuff.

19:07.354 --> 19:09.439
The Vidi boys are greaseballs.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.484
So, there's no one you can think
of who might have done this?

19:12.776 --> 19:16.029
-You got no enemies? No one's mad at you?
-Yeah. Not... not that much.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.323
And you're not involved
in anything illegal that can bite you?

19:18.532 --> 19:20.325
Getting a little sick of your attitude.

19:20.701 --> 19:23.412
I'm clean. No gambling,
no drugs, no debts.

19:23.495 --> 19:26.123
-If anything, people owe me.
-Big sums?

19:26.540 --> 19:30.210
Yeah, the asshole who works for me, Bob.
He owes me ten grand.

19:30.794 --> 19:33.046
-For what?
-Plays the horses.

19:33.755 --> 19:35.507
Stupid stuff, stupid guy.

19:35.799 --> 19:37.593
See, Mr. Szudarek,
that's something helpful.

19:37.801 --> 19:39.219
Sorry I didn't get to it right away,

19:39.303 --> 19:42.014
but see, my face
was crushed in this morning.

19:42.931 --> 19:45.350
-All right, we'll be in touch.
-Yeah, can't wait.

19:50.814 --> 19:52.816
And when did you first meet
Lieutenant Rodriguez?

19:53.233 --> 19:56.653
About 18 months ago,
when I began investigating his squad.

19:56.778 --> 19:59.281
But you became aware of him
long before that, weren't you?

19:59.698 --> 20:03.368
Yes, as a rookie cop, I found myself
in a compromising situation

20:03.452 --> 20:04.578
through no fault of my own.

20:04.828 --> 20:07.956
Without inquiring into the facts,
he reported me to IAB.

20:08.498 --> 20:11.210
I was forced to testify about it
to save my career.

20:11.835 --> 20:14.213
And is that how you wound up
working for Internal Affairs?

20:14.338 --> 20:16.548
-Yes.
-Did your situation leave you

20:16.757 --> 20:18.759
with any bad feelings toward
Lieutenant Rodriguez?

20:19.009 --> 20:21.220
I was angry at the time, but it passed.

20:21.428 --> 20:24.806
My career took off,
and, uh, I forgot about him.

20:25.057 --> 20:29.519
Fact is, until I was given a new command,
I had no contact with him for 16 years.

20:29.645 --> 20:33.106
And what contact have you had with him
since getting a new command?

20:33.565 --> 20:36.818
I have oversight of Manhattan detectives,
including the 15th Squad,

20:36.902 --> 20:39.196
which has been the subject
of several investigations.

20:39.488 --> 20:43.784
And how has Lieutenant Rodriguez reacted
to those investigations?

20:44.076 --> 20:48.247
He's been hostile, uncooperative,
ignored document requests,

20:48.330 --> 20:50.749
and refused to make detectives
available for interviews.

20:51.541 --> 20:53.418
We've had our share of sharp exchanges.

20:53.877 --> 20:57.297
Were your investigations colored
by your history with him?

20:57.756 --> 21:00.133
I won't deny dealing with him
stirred-up memories.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.636
That made me give the 15th
an extra hard look,

21:02.886 --> 21:04.680
-then it was for the best.
-Why do you say that?

21:05.097 --> 21:07.224
Because I uncovered evidence
of rampant corruption.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.977
Objection. Assuming facts not in evidence.

21:10.060 --> 21:12.145
There's been no formal finding
of misconduct.

21:12.604 --> 21:13.605
Sustained.

21:14.898 --> 21:15.899
Captain...

21:16.733 --> 21:19.903
did you receive any bad news
the day of the incident?

21:20.195 --> 21:23.490
Yes, I learned that my relationship
with a female subordinate

21:23.573 --> 21:25.951
had been exposed
to my wife and my superiors.

21:26.410 --> 21:28.829
I also learned that I'd been passed over
for a promotion.

21:29.037 --> 21:32.291
And did you have occasion
to visit Lieutenant Rodriguez that day?

21:32.666 --> 21:34.710
Twice, the first time
to announce the findings

21:34.835 --> 21:36.586
of an ongoing investigation
into the squad.

21:36.878 --> 21:39.881
-JAMES: And what were those findings?
-Detectives moonlighting as bouncers

21:39.965 --> 21:43.135
in clubs serving alcohol,
associating with dealers and the like.

21:43.343 --> 21:46.430
And why did you choose
to announce your findings that day?

21:46.930 --> 21:50.726
When news of my relationship broke,
I knew the lieutenant had tipped off IAB.

21:51.351 --> 21:53.895
I realized he'd do anything
to stop my investigation,

21:53.979 --> 21:57.733
-so I had to move on him fast.
-Objection as to what the witness knew.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.192
Sustained.

21:59.568 --> 22:03.697
How did Lieutenant Rodriguez
respond to news of your findings?

22:04.072 --> 22:06.074
He was confrontational.

22:06.700 --> 22:09.953
I asked point-blank if he had gone to IAB
about my relationship.

22:10.287 --> 22:13.415
He said that he had, and that one way
or the other, he was gonna be rid of me.

22:13.665 --> 22:14.708
What happened next?

22:14.833 --> 22:17.336
He stood up, said it was me
and him alone in that office,

22:17.586 --> 22:20.339
and with the kind of day I was having,
no one would ask what happened.

22:20.839 --> 22:22.132
Did you ask him what he meant by that?

22:22.215 --> 22:24.134
I didn't need to,
because he went for his gun.

22:24.217 --> 22:26.720
-What did you do?
-I drew my gun and fired.

22:27.095 --> 22:30.891
Did you believe Lieutenant Rodriguez
intended to kill you?

22:31.266 --> 22:32.309
I had no doubt.

22:32.601 --> 22:35.854
And did you then move towards him
with the intention of firing again?

22:36.104 --> 22:39.858
No. I followed proper procedure
by covering him with my gun

22:40.025 --> 22:41.735
with the intent of disarming him.

22:42.569 --> 22:44.404
Next thing I know, I'm shot in the back.

22:45.030 --> 22:47.824
-Are you on suspension now?
-I am.

22:47.991 --> 22:50.035
Is it your intent to return to work?

22:51.328 --> 22:54.956
Regardless of what happens here,
my physical disability will prevent that.

22:55.791 --> 22:58.210
My whole life, all I ever wanted
was to be a cop.

22:59.044 --> 23:03.507
And every day for 18 years,
I was the best cop that I could be.

23:04.216 --> 23:08.136
Now it's over 'cause someone didn't like
the fact that I was doing my job.

23:12.474 --> 23:13.725
JAMES: Thank you, captain.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.870
VALERIE: Let's talk about the day
you shot Lieutenant Rodriguez.

23:34.329 --> 23:37.958
On May 20th, your affair
with a subordinate became public.

23:38.375 --> 23:42.087
Your wife threw you out of the house,
and you were passed over for a promotion.

23:42.587 --> 23:44.548
-Correct?
-It was a bad day.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.383
(ALL CHUCKLE)

23:46.716 --> 23:48.427
And on that bad day,

23:49.219 --> 23:50.971
the subordinate
you'd been having an affair with

23:51.430 --> 23:54.182
was filing a sexual harassment suit,
right?

23:54.266 --> 23:55.434
I don't deny any of that.

23:55.642 --> 23:58.437
And in the wake of this tidal wave
of bad news,

23:58.770 --> 24:00.439
you went out and got drunk, didn't you?

24:00.522 --> 24:02.941
I won't deny that I had
a few drinks to steady myself,

24:03.024 --> 24:06.111
-but I can hold my alcohol.
-Is it your testimony here today

24:06.194 --> 24:10.365
that with a blood alcohol content
of point two-five,

24:10.699 --> 24:13.076
three times the limit to legally drive.

24:13.326 --> 24:16.163
You were able to spot
the lieutenant going for his gun,

24:16.413 --> 24:19.332
draw your own pistol and shoot him
before he was even able

24:19.416 --> 24:21.668
-to unholster his weapon?
-That's what happened.

24:21.918 --> 24:24.212
Well, you're the fastest gun in the east,
aren't you, captain?

24:24.546 --> 24:26.006
-Objection.
-JUDGE: Sustained.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.634
Before shooting the lieutenant,

24:29.718 --> 24:33.513
did you or did you not tell
Sergeant Martens that the lieutenant,

24:33.638 --> 24:34.890
"had screwed you for the last time?"

24:35.140 --> 24:38.477
I meant that I had evidence
to prove that he was a dirty cop,

24:38.560 --> 24:39.895
not that I was looking to take him out.

24:40.103 --> 24:41.271
After shooting the lieutenant,

24:41.354 --> 24:43.398
did you or did you not tell
Detective Ortiz

24:43.732 --> 24:44.983
"he got what he deserved"?

24:45.192 --> 24:47.360
I don't recall that.
But since he tried to kill me

24:47.444 --> 24:49.446
for doing my job,
he got better than he deserved.

24:49.696 --> 24:53.575
And did you or did you not ask
Dr. Devlin if the "bastard" was dead?

24:53.825 --> 24:55.911
I don't recall, but I wouldn't wish anyone

24:55.994 --> 24:57.704
who tried to take me out,
a speedy recovery.

24:57.913 --> 25:00.916
You were drunk and enraged
and you tried to kill a man

25:00.999 --> 25:03.960
-you've been obsessed with for years.
-That's a bald-faced lie!

25:04.169 --> 25:06.421
Your entire story's a bald-faced lie,
isn't it, captain?

25:06.880 --> 25:08.840
Objection. Counsel is badgering.

25:09.132 --> 25:10.175
Sustained.

25:11.176 --> 25:12.219
Nothing further.

25:12.969 --> 25:14.095
JAMES: Redirect, Your Honor?

25:15.472 --> 25:19.017
Captain... would you consider yourself,

25:19.309 --> 25:21.978
to use an expression,
a "trigger-happy cop"?

25:22.395 --> 25:24.898
-No.
-JAMES: In your 18 years on the job,

25:25.190 --> 25:27.442
how many times have you fired
your weapon on duty?

25:28.109 --> 25:31.321
-Once.
-So in Lieutenant Rodriguez' office.

25:31.738 --> 25:35.033
That's the only time
you've ever used your weapon?

25:35.825 --> 25:37.869
-That's correct.
-Thank you.

25:47.879 --> 25:49.798
We talked to the torture victim, Szudarek,

25:49.881 --> 25:52.551
says his employee Bob Drazin
is into him for ten grand.

25:52.842 --> 25:54.636
We looked into Drazin.
He's a gambling addict,

25:54.719 --> 25:57.514
-lost his apartment.
-Okay, so we like Drazin. Where is he?

25:57.597 --> 25:58.932
He's coming in.

25:59.683 --> 26:01.226
TONY: How's Troy Miner's wife?

26:01.935 --> 26:04.813
Banged up, but she'll be all right.
We have a female uniform staying with her.

26:05.230 --> 26:07.107
-Anything on the assault?
-Not yet.

26:07.941 --> 26:10.193
-But it's connected to Troy being missing.
-Pretty sure.

26:10.277 --> 26:12.862
-Now we're thinking his cousin's involved?
-We don't know yet.

26:14.030 --> 26:15.448
I could have gotten all that
from your fish.

26:15.574 --> 26:19.119
Maybe I'm a little frustrated here, lieu,
'cause we don't know what's going on yet.

26:19.286 --> 26:21.121
Yeah, we're waiting for Troy
and Andrea's phone dumps.

26:21.246 --> 26:23.498
We got her looking at mug books.
We're doing what we can.

26:23.790 --> 26:25.834
(SIRENS WAILING)

26:30.088 --> 26:32.924
I understand you've hit
some hard luck, Bob.

26:33.258 --> 26:34.342
Living in a shelter?

26:35.093 --> 26:38.680
Yeah, you know, for like a week.
My place has a rodent infestation.

26:38.888 --> 26:41.683
Your old neighbor says you got the boot.
Six months delinquent.

26:42.017 --> 26:43.852
That guy's a meth freak. Serious.

26:44.144 --> 26:46.563
And, uh, and playing the ponies, uh...

26:47.355 --> 26:48.481
How you making out recently?

26:48.690 --> 26:50.942
Some days up, others down.
What's with you two?

26:51.234 --> 26:52.277
You in debt, Bob?

26:54.029 --> 26:55.572
-No.
-Not to your boss?

26:55.822 --> 26:58.074
-Who said that?
-GREG: He did, you dope.

26:58.366 --> 26:59.993
He's awake and lucid,

27:00.076 --> 27:02.996
and he says that you're a bum
who's into him for ten grand.

27:03.997 --> 27:06.374
-Got your wheels turning?
-Ron's a liar.

27:06.583 --> 27:07.792
No, no, no.

27:08.043 --> 27:10.086
Well, see, you were just
about to get in front of it

27:10.170 --> 27:11.796
and make sure we got
the best possible take

27:11.880 --> 27:14.132
on how this went wrong,
but then you took road B,

27:14.382 --> 27:17.093
-which is to lie and act like an asshole.
-Excuse me?

27:18.178 --> 27:21.848
-Exactly what are you trying to say?
-That you set your boss up to get robbed.

27:22.140 --> 27:23.683
Oh, you're a real pair of bastards.

27:23.892 --> 27:26.144
I'll give you ten seconds to spit it out
and say how much you loved him.

27:26.353 --> 27:27.687
You're damn right I loved him.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.941
Love him. He's my best friend.
And I would never do anything to hurt him!

27:32.067 --> 27:33.276
If you're to suggest...

27:35.236 --> 27:37.447
-Done?
-You go to hell.

27:38.865 --> 27:41.242
When we get the guys in here
who tortured Ron,

27:41.451 --> 27:43.662
do you honestly think they're gonna
stand up for you, Bob?

27:43.828 --> 27:45.622
Or do you think they're
gonna roll on your ass

27:45.705 --> 27:47.248
to save themselves time in jail?

27:47.332 --> 27:50.502
Suggestion? Since you're here first,
save yourself the time in jail.

27:52.837 --> 27:54.547
He wasn't supposed
to get tortured like that.

27:55.757 --> 27:58.259
-What was supposed to happen?
-Simple robbery.

27:59.094 --> 28:00.679
He's got cash in the apartment.

28:00.762 --> 28:02.681
Get him to give it up,
we split it down the middle.

28:02.847 --> 28:04.599
But that Black kid didn't say anything

28:04.766 --> 28:07.727
about beatings
or burning Ron with a cigarette.

28:08.019 --> 28:09.062
Who did you hire this out to?

28:09.521 --> 28:12.107
Some kid I met at the shelter, Troy Miner.

28:14.401 --> 28:17.195
We know this Troy Miner.
He's not homeless.

28:17.737 --> 28:20.865
He was doing community service on a DWI.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.785
He lost his job. He needed cash, so did I.

28:24.911 --> 28:26.788
Maybe a little payback to Ron

28:26.871 --> 28:28.957
for being the world's biggest
loudmouth schlong.

28:29.207 --> 28:31.167
Calling me "idiot" in front of people.

28:31.418 --> 28:33.795
Humiliating me 'cause I got a run
of bad luck.

28:34.003 --> 28:36.172
You've seen Troy today?
You know where he's at?

28:36.256 --> 28:37.424
No. No clue.

28:39.092 --> 28:40.844
Write down everything you told us.

28:41.636 --> 28:43.346
I'll get the others up to speed on Troy.

28:49.978 --> 28:50.979
What's going on with Troy?

28:51.354 --> 28:53.398
And either you get straight with us
or we're locking you up.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.191
What do you want me to tell you?
I don't know nothing!

28:55.567 --> 28:59.612
We just got word that Troy hatched
a plan with a guy named Bob Drazin,

28:59.696 --> 29:02.615
who he met doing his community service
off that DWI.

29:02.741 --> 29:03.783
COREY: First I heard of that.

29:03.867 --> 29:06.703
They decided to rip off
this barber named Szudarek,

29:06.786 --> 29:08.246
and that plan went down, Corey.

29:08.455 --> 29:10.540
Okay, look here.
Obviously, something's up!

29:10.874 --> 29:12.500
-Let me go and...
-No, you ain't going nowhere

29:12.584 --> 29:13.668
until Troy turns up.

29:13.877 --> 29:16.588
-He'll turn up if you let me turn him up!
-Yeah, well, you had your chance.

29:16.713 --> 29:18.631
Now you're a suspect. You're staying here!

29:19.466 --> 29:22.135
Troy having piece of ass
on the side, that was all bullshit.

29:22.385 --> 29:24.971
I was just trying to buy some time,
so I could figure this out, okay?

29:25.472 --> 29:27.140
-If you'd let me...
-Where's Troy?

29:27.223 --> 29:29.184
And that's the last time
I ask that question

29:29.267 --> 29:30.518
without following it with a smack.

29:30.602 --> 29:32.520
All right, okay!
He called me all freaked out,

29:32.896 --> 29:37.192
He was saying that they were after him,
and how he just needed a place to lay low.

29:37.442 --> 29:39.068
-Who was after him?
-He wouldn't say.

29:39.152 --> 29:41.738
I just told him to go to my apartment,
and I told him where the key was.

29:41.863 --> 29:43.281
Why aren't you there, then?

29:45.742 --> 29:47.702
Hey, Corey, let go of this dumbass notion

29:47.786 --> 29:50.580
that you can fix this on your own,
'cause you can't. We can.

29:52.999 --> 29:57.378
(SIGHS) I got some cats hassling me,
who I hope Troy ain't mixed up with.

29:57.504 --> 29:59.714
and I don't want them following me
back to my apartment.

30:00.089 --> 30:02.634
So don't even bother asking me
to give you any info on 'em

30:02.884 --> 30:05.094

-I didn't do a damn thing.

how you met Bob Drazin

at a homeless shelter
and he tipped you off

33:07.110 --> 33:10.321

at the apartment, but how did it go down?

once we got in the apartment,

33:19.998 --> 33:21.374
he wouldn't give up the money.

33:21.666 --> 33:24.085
So, T.K And Robbie,
they started to lay into him.

33:24.502 --> 33:28.381
I wasn't down for that.
I told 'em to chill, they don't listen,

33:29.507 --> 33:32.135

Robbie catches me,

33:32.552 --> 33:34.303
pulls out his gun,
like he's gonna take me out.

33:34.554 --> 33:37.807
He turned his back. That's when I hit
the fire escape, and I was gone.

33:37.932 --> 33:39.767
So they followed you
to your cousin's apartment?

33:40.018 --> 33:41.019
They must have.

33:41.185 --> 33:43.229
All I know is they got there
just before you guys did.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.608
-The old man, he live?
-Yeah.

33:47.859 --> 33:50.611
All right, getting hooked up
with T.K. And Robbie,

33:50.987 --> 33:54.532
-did you go through your cousin for that?
-No. We talked about it.

33:54.782 --> 33:57.243
We was just gonna give
the whole deal to Corey and take a cut,

33:57.326 --> 33:59.579
like Drazin was doing,
but I left Corey out of it

33:59.704 --> 34:01.456
and went straight to T.K.
and Robbie on my own,

34:01.539 --> 34:02.957
and that was a big mistake.

34:03.249 --> 34:06.252
When "we" talked about it, who's "we"?

34:07.128 --> 34:08.296
You and your wife?

34:09.255 --> 34:12.300
She never did nothing!
All we did was talk about it.

34:16.012 --> 34:17.889
Can I please just talk to her?

34:24.896 --> 34:27.482
This is a simple story of vengeance.

34:27.690 --> 34:30.902
The defendant's personal
and professional lives had come apart.

34:31.235 --> 34:35.114
He told everyone in earshot
Lieutenant Rodriguez was to blame.

34:35.281 --> 34:37.575
Then he sought out his victim,
and he shot him

34:37.658 --> 34:39.702
in an alcohol-induced rage.

34:40.328 --> 34:44.707
You don't need anything more to convict,
ladies and gentlemen, but you have more.

34:45.166 --> 34:48.377
Eighteen months
of frivolous investigations

34:48.503 --> 34:50.463
that failed to yield results.

34:51.130 --> 34:53.925
And years of smoldering resentment.

34:54.550 --> 34:57.970
And the damning testimonies
of six witnesses,

34:58.054 --> 35:00.640
including the defendant's
own co-workers.

35:00.890 --> 35:03.351
What testimony does the defendant offer?

35:03.643 --> 35:06.938
A career criminal
the lieutenant had put away twice,

35:07.396 --> 35:09.774
a cop who contradicted that criminal

35:09.857 --> 35:13.152
and the defendant's own
self-serving statements.

35:14.529 --> 35:18.116
But the defendant asks you
to believe the unbelievable.

35:18.282 --> 35:23.371
That the lieutenant would risk everything
to kill a discredited man.

35:23.538 --> 35:27.458
Whose bogus investigations were,
at worst, a nuisance.

35:28.376 --> 35:35.133
That a drunk drew his pistol and fired
before a sober man unholstered his weapon.

35:36.008 --> 35:40.555
On that day, Captain Fraker,
a drunk, disgraced adulterer,

35:40.638 --> 35:45.143
walked into Lieutenant Rodriguez' office,
and unprovoked, shot him.

35:45.518 --> 35:49.355
I ask you to find Captain Fraker guilty.

35:50.314 --> 35:51.607
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

36:00.616 --> 36:04.620
Let's look at the prosecution's
vaunted witnesses,

36:05.121 --> 36:08.291
detectives in Tony Rodriguez's
own command,

36:08.457 --> 36:12.545
a doctor who was sleeping
with one of those detectives,

36:12.837 --> 36:15.214
an underling bucking for a promotion,

36:15.965 --> 36:17.758
an angry ex-girlfriend.

36:18.843 --> 36:23.264
The prosecution has not offered you
a single unbiased witness,

36:23.764 --> 36:26.809
not one. So forget the witnesses.

36:27.393 --> 36:30.605
Because only two men know
what really happened in that office.

36:30.730 --> 36:33.274
Captain Fraker had been coming
for Tony Rodriguez.

36:34.066 --> 36:36.652
Five investigations in 18 months.

36:37.111 --> 36:40.323
The latest concerning serious charges
that have never been refuted.

36:40.740 --> 36:44.535
You don't think Tony Rodriguez
wanted to be rid of the captain?

36:45.119 --> 36:46.412
You bet he did.

36:46.829 --> 36:49.498
And whether these two men
disliked each other

36:49.582 --> 36:53.544
and for whatever reason is irrelevant
to the only facts that matter.

36:54.212 --> 36:57.632
It all comes down
to who you want to believe.

36:58.883 --> 37:03.721
A cop, who's been the target
of investigations involving corruption

37:04.055 --> 37:05.348
and excessive force,

37:05.932 --> 37:11.854
or a cop who has spent his entire career
protecting our city, fighting corruption,

37:12.521 --> 37:15.900
and rooting out cops
who use excessive force.

37:16.359 --> 37:18.945
Remember your job,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

37:19.195 --> 37:23.324
If you have any reasonable doubt
about the prosecution's case,

37:23.824 --> 37:28.037
you must find Captain Fraker not guilty.

37:39.715 --> 37:41.342
-You get Troy to central booking?
-ANDY: Yeah.

37:41.801 --> 37:43.094
How about the other two clowns?

37:43.177 --> 37:45.012
-They're being treated at Bellevue.
-TONY: Any word on that?

37:45.221 --> 37:47.556
One's got a busted pelvis,
the other guy's under the knife

37:47.682 --> 37:49.016
for internal bleeding. He's up in the air.

37:49.350 --> 37:52.311
Uniforms are sitting on both of them.
I notified the borough to keep tabs.

37:53.145 --> 37:54.772
All right. Good night.

37:56.315 --> 37:57.316
Uh, boss...

37:58.276 --> 38:00.861
down at Mac's, they have this thing,
I don't know if you've heard of it before

38:00.987 --> 38:03.030
it's called "cold beer."
And let me tell you,

38:03.489 --> 38:06.033
they invented it in response
to that look on your face.

38:06.409 --> 38:07.451
Maybe...

38:07.702 --> 38:09.996
JOHN JR.: Apparently, money.
Which I currently have in my pocket,

38:10.579 --> 38:11.789
can purchase this item.

38:12.248 --> 38:13.582
Well, I guess you're buying.

38:15.334 --> 38:18.546
-Field trip, down to Mac's, anybody?
-I'm in.

38:18.713 --> 38:19.797
I'm in, sure.

38:21.716 --> 38:23.134
See if you can get Valerie
to join us, huh?

38:23.968 --> 38:25.428
I'll meet you over there.

38:26.387 --> 38:28.055
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

38:30.516 --> 38:33.019
-Go ahead, John. I got it.
-I'll see you there.

38:35.938 --> 38:37.773
-Where's Troy?
-Jail.

38:38.065 --> 38:39.859
Oh, my God. Um, for what?

38:40.151 --> 38:41.944
He didn't hand that job over to Corey.

38:42.194 --> 38:44.864
-Like the two of you talked about.
-Talked about?

38:45.156 --> 38:47.742
Because you played games this morning
to keep your name out of it,

38:47.867 --> 38:50.453
-your husband almost got killed.
-I told you about Corey.

38:50.703 --> 38:52.872
And you left out the other 99 percent.

38:54.665 --> 38:55.875
We're completely broke.

38:56.250 --> 38:58.169
Troy was just supposed
to tell Corey about it...

38:58.419 --> 39:00.796
The only reason I'm not locking you up
is 'cause you got kids at home,

39:00.880 --> 39:03.382
and they don't deserve
to be in some institution.

39:08.888 --> 39:11.182
-ANDREA: How long is Troy going away for?
-Ask your lawyer.

39:11.891 --> 39:13.851
Can you please just tell me?

39:15.102 --> 39:17.605
He's looking at a couple of years,
at least.

39:18.022 --> 39:19.190
Oh, my God.

39:20.274 --> 39:21.400
All right, we're done.

39:22.109 --> 39:23.444
Go home now to your kids.

39:35.164 --> 39:38.584
And so, we're in the squad,
doing a late tour,

39:38.834 --> 39:40.628
and McCuskey comes back from dinner

39:40.753 --> 39:43.297
-with this huge hickey on his neck.
-Oh, boy.

39:43.631 --> 39:47.051
I knew McCuskey in Queens homicide.
Big time skirt chaser.

39:47.426 --> 39:51.347
So, he's got two hours left
before he has to head home to his wife.

39:51.764 --> 39:53.849
And he's begging us
to help him get rid of it.

39:53.933 --> 39:55.101
Oh, yeah. They don't come off.

39:55.184 --> 39:58.104
GREG: So, McCuskey goes
to the utility closet,

39:58.270 --> 40:00.481
and he comes out with a wire brush.

40:00.689 --> 40:03.943
He takes two pulls of whiskey
from his hip flask,

40:04.777 --> 40:08.239
and he rakes his neck bloody
to cover the hickey.

40:08.531 --> 40:09.532
-Oh.
-GREG: He goes home,

40:09.949 --> 40:13.911
he tells his wife a perp did it,
and she actually buys it!

40:13.994 --> 40:15.704
(LAUGHS)

40:19.792 --> 40:21.460
Yeah, I think I'm gonna get going.

40:21.710 --> 40:23.087
-Yeah?
-Yeah, I'm beat.

40:23.421 --> 40:24.505
Thanks for the beer.

40:26.674 --> 40:29.385
I think I'm out, too. I'll be in touch.

40:29.635 --> 40:31.345
All right, I'll settle up
and walk you to your car.

40:33.931 --> 40:36.934
-Hey, wanna lose at darts?
-Um, I think I'm heading out, too.

40:37.935 --> 40:38.936
Good night.

It was fine, Greg.
It... it lightened things up.

40:47.194 --> 40:50.990
I'm sure Andy has a differing opinion.
In fact, I'm certain of it.

40:51.866 --> 40:55.119
Look, if I been on you too hard,
I don't mean nothing by it.

40:55.369 --> 40:57.496

41:07.882 --> 41:10.050
-RITA: Hey.
-What's up?

41:10.509 --> 41:13.012
Nothing. Um, can I catch a ride home?

41:13.429 --> 41:15.806
I was gonna drive down to the seaport,
take a walk.

41:16.056 --> 41:17.099
I got time.

41:18.392 --> 41:19.518
Sure, okay.

41:28.152 --> 41:30.946
My first real collar
was this guy Ralph Maldonado.

41:31.780 --> 41:34.450
I finally got him
on receiving stolen goods,

41:34.533 --> 41:39.038
but he was notorious for shaking down
local businesses for protection money.

41:39.997 --> 41:43.584
So satisfying because Ralph
was the exact type of guy

41:43.667 --> 41:46.045
that made me wanna get on the job
in the first place.

41:46.670 --> 41:47.713
A bully.

41:48.464 --> 41:50.174

What do you mean?
I'm just telling you a story.

41:55.095 --> 41:57.264
-You're giving your own eulogy.
-You got it wrong.

41:57.681 --> 41:58.891
No, that's what you're doing.

41:59.016 --> 42:01.560
And you're way off,
because the jury's gonna convict Fraker,

42:01.644 --> 42:03.229
and everything is gonna be everything.

42:10.110 --> 42:14.323
I guess, I'm just saying that I'm proud
of the time I put on the job.

42:14.532 --> 42:16.367
Well, you got a lot more years
ahead of you.

42:16.534 --> 42:17.952
A lot more good you can do.
