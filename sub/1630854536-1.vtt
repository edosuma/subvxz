WEBVTT

00:00.771 --> 00:03.042
(intense music)

00:18.703 --> 00:21.543
(Carmen groaning)

00:25.416 --> 00:27.252
(tense music)

00:27.252 --> 00:30.859
(Carmen breathing heavily)

00:31.894 --> 00:33.163
(door banging)

00:33.163 --> 00:36.101
(Carmen screams)

00:36.101 --> 00:38.673
(somber music)

01:55.078 --> 01:56.045
- Come on.

01:56.045 --> 01:58.616
Take your time, take your time.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.689
You good? - Thanks, babe.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.125
- You're welcome.

02:05.129 --> 02:06.665
(car door shuts)

02:06.665 --> 02:08.735
So what you think?

02:08.735 --> 02:11.640
- Oh my gosh, baby.

02:11.640 --> 02:13.677
This is so beautiful.

02:15.114 --> 02:16.282
I can't believe you've been holding this out from me.

02:16.282 --> 02:17.551
(James chuckles)

02:17.551 --> 02:18.920
Now why haven't we been here before?

02:20.289 --> 02:22.226
- You know, my people, they hardly get outta here.

02:23.294 --> 02:24.497
I finally convinced them

02:24.497 --> 02:26.099
to give us the spot for the weekend.

02:27.569 --> 02:29.572
It's pretty big, isn't it?

02:29.572 --> 02:32.043
- Yes, it is, it looks huge.

02:32.043 --> 02:33.279
- Mm-hmm.

02:33.279 --> 02:34.014
- I can see why they don't leave.

02:35.483 --> 02:38.588
I'm sure the inside is just as beautiful as the outside.

02:38.588 --> 02:40.859
- Yeah, just like you.

02:40.859 --> 02:42.462
(both laughing)

02:42.462 --> 02:45.001
But yeah, we got this whole place

02:45.001 --> 02:46.437
to ourself the whole weekend.

02:48.373 --> 02:51.512
Let's enjoy this last weekend kidless.

02:53.015 --> 02:55.319
You sure this whole water birth thing is all right?

02:56.688 --> 02:58.424
- Of course, baby.

02:58.424 --> 02:59.493
Why wouldn't it be?

03:01.029 --> 03:03.835
It's what I've always dreamed of,

03:03.835 --> 03:06.038
naturally bringing our baby into this world.

03:08.008 --> 03:09.611
I will be fine.

03:09.611 --> 03:11.482
You will be fine.

03:11.482 --> 03:13.418
We will be fine.

03:13.418 --> 03:15.322
- All right. - Trust me.

03:15.322 --> 03:16.891
- I trust you.

03:16.891 --> 03:20.564
But look, I want you to go ahead and go inside the house,

03:20.564 --> 03:22.400
and I'll get the bags.

03:23.369 --> 03:25.006
Take a load off.

03:25.006 --> 03:26.509
- All right. - Yeah.

03:26.509 --> 03:27.711
- I'll see you in there.

03:27.711 --> 03:28.813
- All right, you good?

03:28.813 --> 03:30.048
- [Carmen] Yes.

03:30.048 --> 03:31.251
- All right.

03:31.251 --> 03:32.318
- Just enjoying the beautiful view.

03:32.318 --> 03:33.153
- All right.

03:33.153 --> 03:35.157
(Carmen giggles)

03:35.157 --> 03:38.162
(suspenseful music)

03:45.476 --> 03:48.147
(trunk opening)

04:01.170 --> 04:04.076
(bug buzzing)

04:04.076 --> 04:07.916
(suspenseful music continues)

04:27.585 --> 04:30.256
(door shutting)

04:39.006 --> 04:39.840
- No help?

04:41.242 --> 04:44.482
- (laughs) Don't you see me over here cooking a whole baby?

04:45.350 --> 04:47.521
Drop them bags right there.

04:47.521 --> 04:48.589
Come have a seat.

04:50.726 --> 04:52.262
- Girl, you're something else.

04:52.262 --> 04:55.735
- [Carmen] (laughs) I know.

04:55.735 --> 04:56.904
- I need this.

04:58.875 --> 05:01.846
Man, I ain't been here in years.

05:01.846 --> 05:03.082
Still look the same.

05:04.584 --> 05:06.187
- Are you ready?

05:06.187 --> 05:07.056
- Ready for what?

05:08.124 --> 05:09.827
- To baste the turkey.

05:09.827 --> 05:12.533
(laughs) To become parents, James.

05:13.835 --> 05:14.669
- Of course I'm ready.

05:14.669 --> 05:16.306
Why wouldn't I be ready?

05:16.306 --> 05:18.777
- I mean, it's our first rodeo.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.480
Our first child, (sentimental music)

05:20.480 --> 05:22.751
something we have zero experience with.

05:23.886 --> 05:25.222
- Every parent who had their first child

05:25.222 --> 05:26.858
had zero experience.

05:26.858 --> 05:29.730
- See, I knew we should've gotten a dog first.

05:29.730 --> 05:32.167
- Dogs shit and pee everywhere anyway.

05:32.167 --> 05:34.371
- And babies don't? - Oh my goodness.

05:34.371 --> 05:35.941
- See, you the first one on diaper duty.

05:35.941 --> 05:37.711
- Oh no, I'm not. - Mm-hmm.

05:37.711 --> 05:39.848
- Oh my goodness.

05:39.848 --> 05:41.418
(Carmen exhales)

05:41.418 --> 05:44.456
- Look, this is a big step for us.

05:46.025 --> 05:48.730
This is gonna change our life forever.

05:51.803 --> 05:55.476
- Carmen, I need you to stop worrying, okay?

05:56.779 --> 05:59.083
Look, we got each other,

05:59.083 --> 06:01.821
but can we please just enjoy our time together?

06:01.821 --> 06:03.123
- Okay.

06:03.123 --> 06:04.292
- Okay? - Yeah.

06:05.828 --> 06:08.767
(kissing)

06:08.767 --> 06:11.237
Okay, you go ahead and put the things upstairs

06:11.237 --> 06:13.074
with your fine self,

06:13.074 --> 06:16.781
and I'll come help in a minute or two, or three.

06:19.686 --> 06:21.924
Probably not. (laughs)

06:23.326 --> 06:25.197
- [James] You do look good while you're cooking.

06:25.197 --> 06:26.699
- Yeah?

06:26.699 --> 06:28.302
And this the only thing I'm gonna be cooking, too.

06:28.302 --> 06:29.137
- [James] What?

06:29.137 --> 06:30.739
- I didn't stutter.

06:30.739 --> 06:31.975
- [James] You lucky I love you.

06:31.975 --> 06:34.146
- [Carmen] Correction, you're lucky I love you.

06:36.049 --> 06:39.889
(sentimental music continues)

06:47.904 --> 06:50.809
- Breathe out. (Carmen exhales)

06:50.809 --> 06:52.178
There you go.

06:52.178 --> 06:55.251
Breathe in. (Carmen inhales)

06:55.251 --> 06:57.722
Breathe out. (Carmen exhales)

06:57.722 --> 06:58.924
Just like we worked on in class.

06:58.924 --> 07:02.664
Again, in. (Carmen inhales)

07:02.664 --> 07:06.236
Out. (Carmen exhales)

07:06.236 --> 07:07.640
There you go.

07:07.640 --> 07:08.975
Again, breath in. (Carmen breathes heavily)

07:08.975 --> 07:10.711
- Okay, that's it, baby.

07:10.711 --> 07:11.980
Look, I'm done.

07:12.882 --> 07:13.716
- Done?

07:14.985 --> 07:17.156
You've only been going for like five minutes.

07:17.156 --> 07:18.927
- Easy for you to say.

07:18.927 --> 07:20.396
It's like five minutes for you,

07:20.396 --> 07:22.967
but it's more like five damn hours for me.

07:24.403 --> 07:25.338
Shit, it's hot.

07:25.338 --> 07:26.573
- Here, here, here, here.

07:26.573 --> 07:28.443
- I'm tired. - It's all right.

07:28.443 --> 07:29.712
It's all right.

07:32.083 --> 07:33.719
We're gonna get up on three, okay?

07:33.719 --> 07:34.554
- Okay.

07:35.623 --> 07:38.461
- One, two, three.

07:38.461 --> 07:39.296
- Oh.

07:40.298 --> 07:41.734
- Now, are you hungry?

07:41.734 --> 07:44.706
- Baby, when are we never not hungry?

07:44.706 --> 07:45.674
- That is true.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.010
Y'all can eat. (Carmen giggles)

07:47.010 --> 07:48.412
Tell me what you want.

07:48.412 --> 07:50.049
- We can go for a light snack,

07:50.049 --> 07:52.119
maybe a yogurt or something.

07:52.119 --> 07:53.355
- All right, coming right up.

07:53.355 --> 07:55.092
- Oh, baby, can you add some honey?

07:56.260 --> 07:58.130
- Okay. - Then add some sprinkles,

07:59.299 --> 08:01.235
and then top it with some grapes.

08:01.235 --> 08:02.505
- Oh my-

08:02.505 --> 08:03.907
- Oh, and then put a pickle on the side.

08:03.907 --> 08:06.111
- Oh my gosh, them pregnancy cravings kicking in.

08:06.111 --> 08:07.514
That'll be disgusting.

08:07.514 --> 08:08.750
- [Carmen] Whatever.

08:08.750 --> 08:10.519
Don't judge me and your baby. - Whatever.

08:10.519 --> 08:12.489
- Look, I'm about to go take a bath and soak, okay?

08:12.489 --> 08:14.960
And get out these sweaty clothes.

08:14.960 --> 08:16.095
- You want me to join?

08:16.095 --> 08:18.266
- Mm, maybe. - Okay.

08:18.266 --> 08:19.101
- Uh-uh.

08:19.101 --> 08:20.003
Slow down.

08:20.003 --> 08:21.439
The shower's the reason

08:21.439 --> 08:23.575
why we're in this position in the first place.

08:23.575 --> 08:24.511
- That is true.

08:24.511 --> 08:25.813
You lucky it ain't twins.

08:25.813 --> 08:27.182
- (laughs) It might as well be.

08:27.182 --> 08:28.684
You see how big I am.

08:29.887 --> 08:33.060
- Grape, and doggone sprinkles,

08:33.060 --> 08:34.762
with a pickle on the side is coming up.

08:34.762 --> 08:36.399
But please don't take forever in the day.

08:36.399 --> 08:37.902
You know we got Phillip and Gisele coming

08:37.902 --> 08:39.638
and we gotta still cook dinner.

08:39.638 --> 08:41.074
- Mm-mm.

08:41.074 --> 08:43.011
I told you I wasn't cooking anymore, remember?

08:43.011 --> 08:45.749
You take care of that, sweetheart, okay?

08:45.749 --> 08:47.318
Like you took care of this.

08:47.318 --> 08:48.487
- Mm.

08:48.487 --> 08:52.628
You know I'ma take care of that, for sure.

08:52.628 --> 08:56.502

08:56.502 --> 09:01.210

10:40.222 --> 10:43.060
(laughing)

10:43.060 --> 10:44.596
- [Phillip] Oh, man.

10:44.596 --> 10:46.633
- Girl, I can't see why you can eat that nasty ice cream.

10:46.633 --> 10:47.602
- Girl, whatever.

10:47.602 --> 10:48.703
This ice cream is the bomb.

10:48.703 --> 10:49.805
Here you go.

10:49.805 --> 10:50.774
- Get that shit away from me.

10:50.774 --> 10:52.276
You know I can't eat that.

10:52.276 --> 10:53.078
- Why not?

10:54.147 --> 10:55.382
- I'm allergic to nuts.

10:55.382 --> 10:56.785
- (laughs) No you're not.

10:57.887 --> 10:58.721
Oh, come on.

10:58.721 --> 11:00.491
Really? - Uh.

11:00.491 --> 11:02.261
Look, girl, I'm sorry, I forgot.

11:02.261 --> 11:06.536
But James, this cabin is just so nice.

11:06.536 --> 11:07.671
It's beautiful.

11:07.671 --> 11:09.174
- Thank you, thank you.

11:09.174 --> 11:10.910
- Man, we got some good memories up in here, man.

11:12.379 --> 11:14.817
Oh, man, remember the time we brought them twins up in here?

11:14.817 --> 11:19.025
Yeah, and we was teaching them how to play double dutch.

11:19.025 --> 11:20.394
Yeah, hopscotch.

11:20.394 --> 11:21.996
You know, just fun PG things.

11:21.996 --> 11:26.237
- Yeah, we definitely had a lot of memories in here

11:26.237 --> 11:27.306
when we was young.

11:27.306 --> 11:28.274
- Mm-hmm. - Mm.

11:28.274 --> 11:29.076
- For sure. - Mm-hmm.

11:29.076 --> 11:30.011
- Nothing like that.

11:30.011 --> 11:31.246
- James told me all them stories

11:31.246 --> 11:33.183
about y'all up in here acting a fool.

11:33.183 --> 11:34.719
- Oh.

11:34.719 --> 11:36.523
Acting a fool, huh? - Mm-hmm.

11:36.523 --> 11:38.426
- Babe, we was reading books.

11:38.426 --> 11:40.497
You see that shelf right there full of books?

11:40.497 --> 11:42.032
- All of them, for sure. - We read 'em.

11:42.032 --> 11:43.335
- Mm-hmm. - Yep, that was us.

11:43.335 --> 11:45.205
- [Gisele] Mm-hmm, I'm sure you were.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.006
- Damn.

11:47.676 --> 11:49.813
- Y'all two are crazy for each other. (laughs)

11:49.813 --> 11:51.048
Just perfect.

11:51.048 --> 11:52.919
- Hey, like two peas in a damn pod.

11:54.155 --> 11:55.724
I've been trying to tell her for years.

11:55.724 --> 11:57.026
She ain't listening to me.

11:57.026 --> 11:58.162
Maybe you can bring some sense into her.

11:58.162 --> 11:58.963
- Ah.

12:00.199 --> 12:03.604
So, you two, are y'all ready for the weekend?

12:03.604 --> 12:05.141
- Yeah. - I'm not.

12:05.141 --> 12:08.380
But this one right here is always ready for everything.

12:08.380 --> 12:10.884
- Yeah, we finally having our first child.

12:10.884 --> 12:12.521
- Aww. - Yeah, your son.

12:12.521 --> 12:13.824
Talk about right there. - Of course.

12:13.824 --> 12:14.658
- That's what I'm talking about.

12:14.658 --> 12:15.860
- You already know.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.864
- (sighs) I'm just ready for this to be over,

12:17.864 --> 12:20.268
you know, getting back to working on my body

12:20.268 --> 12:21.838
and getting back to work.

12:21.838 --> 12:23.740
- Oh, I thought we already talked about this.

12:23.740 --> 12:25.644
You're not going back to work.

12:25.644 --> 12:28.683
- No, we haven't fully discussed anything yet.

12:29.585 --> 12:31.087
You mentioned it once

12:31.087 --> 12:33.124
and then I didn't even have a chance to respond to it.

12:33.124 --> 12:35.796
- No, you said you would give it a chance.

12:35.796 --> 12:38.133
Look, I'm not trying to have the mother of my first child

12:38.133 --> 12:39.870
rushing back to work.

12:39.870 --> 12:42.307
I make enough money for all three of us.

12:42.307 --> 12:44.144
- Us too. (laughs)

12:44.144 --> 12:46.214
He a professional.

12:46.214 --> 12:49.554
Hey, okay, have you at least picked a name for the baby yet?

12:50.890 --> 12:52.292
- No, not yet.

12:52.292 --> 12:54.363
We're gonna decide on the name

12:54.363 --> 12:55.598
once we see the little angel's face.

12:55.598 --> 12:56.467
- Yeah, yeah.

12:57.401 --> 12:59.405
- Aww, y'all, that's so sweet.

13:00.407 --> 13:02.545
(Phillip chuckling)

13:02.545 --> 13:06.985
- Oh, man.

13:06.985 --> 13:08.187
What?

13:08.187 --> 13:09.523
What you looking at me for?

13:10.892 --> 13:11.928
- When are we gonna start having our own kids?

13:11.928 --> 13:13.798
- (laughs) The devil is alive.

13:13.798 --> 13:14.632
Oh.

13:14.632 --> 13:15.467
Soon, babe, all right?

13:15.467 --> 13:17.237
I mean, come on, man.

13:18.673 --> 13:22.413
Look, there's nothing else I want more in this word

13:22.413 --> 13:24.317
than a bunch of bad-ass kids running around

13:24.317 --> 13:25.319
tearing up my shit.

13:25.319 --> 13:27.188
- Mm-hmm.

13:27.188 --> 13:28.624
Yeah.

13:28.624 --> 13:32.331
So anyways, how are y'all gonna do this whole

13:32.331 --> 13:33.801
natural birth thing?

13:33.801 --> 13:38.208
Because I know when it's my turn, straight epidural.

13:38.208 --> 13:40.512
Come on, give it to me and knock my ass out, for real.

13:40.512 --> 13:41.715
- She ain't playing.

13:41.715 --> 13:42.950
I can see it, you know what I'm saying?

13:42.950 --> 13:44.152
She don't need to be pregnant for it.

13:44.152 --> 13:45.388
- Mm-mm. - Stop.

13:45.388 --> 13:47.358
- No, we've actually decided

13:47.358 --> 13:49.395
to use the assistance of a midwife.

13:49.395 --> 13:51.866
- Yeah. - Excuse me, a what?

13:51.866 --> 13:53.602
- Midwife.

13:53.602 --> 13:56.541
They specialize in water births.

13:56.541 --> 13:58.177
- That's a thing?

13:58.177 --> 14:00.782
- Yeah, she's something like a natural birth coach.

14:00.782 --> 14:01.851
- Yeah.

14:01.851 --> 14:03.755
- A natural what what?

14:04.956 --> 14:07.728
Okay, that sounds a little crazy to me.

14:07.728 --> 14:08.729
- Why?

14:08.729 --> 14:10.533
Why's that sound crazy? - Yeah.

14:10.533 --> 14:12.537
- I mean, I don't know,

14:12.537 --> 14:15.776
you got this strange person who you don't know

14:15.776 --> 14:18.848
coming over to y'all place and helping you

14:18.848 --> 14:22.254
and assisting with the birth of your own baby?

14:22.254 --> 14:24.992
- Yeah, I think that's kinda wild, you know what I'm saying?

14:24.992 --> 14:27.531
I mean, and what if she's crazy?

14:27.531 --> 14:29.033
- Mm-hmm. - Deranged.

14:29.033 --> 14:30.102
- Mm.

14:30.102 --> 14:32.005
Oh, oh, or psycho. - Hmm.

14:32.005 --> 14:34.543
- Now come on, y'all know we be watching them movies

14:34.543 --> 14:35.778
where they them crazy women

14:35.778 --> 14:37.314
who always trying to take another woman baby.

14:37.314 --> 14:38.249
- Yep, all the time. - Mm-mm.

14:38.249 --> 14:39.518
Girl, do not wish that on us.

14:39.518 --> 14:42.524
- I'm not. - That's just the movies.

14:42.524 --> 14:44.627
It's not crazy. - At all.

14:44.627 --> 14:45.863
It's really not.

14:45.863 --> 14:48.234
It's actually pretty normal, you know?

14:48.234 --> 14:51.607
We interviewed with dozens of midwives.

14:51.607 --> 14:52.943
- Yeah. - It's a job.

14:52.943 --> 14:54.746
- Oh, y'all did?

14:56.081 --> 14:59.788
So did y'all do phone interviews or these were in person?

14:59.788 --> 15:01.325
- By phone. - Yeah.

15:01.325 --> 15:02.994
- Someone from my lamaze class

15:02.994 --> 15:05.265
suggested a service that we can use,

15:05.265 --> 15:08.872
and the midwife that we've selected is highly regarded.

15:08.872 --> 15:09.906
- Okay.

15:11.108 --> 15:12.512
- Really?

15:12.512 --> 15:15.350
I thought you were supposed to meet your midwife

15:15.350 --> 15:18.555
way before the birth of the baby,

15:18.555 --> 15:20.993
not a couple days before the birth?

15:20.993 --> 15:23.932
- I mean, you are, and we did.

15:23.932 --> 15:24.866
- Yeah.

15:24.866 --> 15:26.670
- It's just, she stopped coming.

15:26.670 --> 15:30.210
So we used the service to get an immediate replacement.

15:30.210 --> 15:32.113
- Hold up, y'all, I'm sorry.

15:32.113 --> 15:33.415
I gotta stop y'all right there.

15:33.415 --> 15:36.755
So she just stopped showing up?

15:36.755 --> 15:39.193
Y'all don't think that's kinda weird?

15:40.528 --> 15:43.433
So, when are you gonna meet the new one?

15:44.302 --> 15:45.804
- Tomorrow, actually.

15:45.804 --> 15:47.006
She lives pretty far out,

15:47.006 --> 15:48.542
so we had to come here.

15:48.542 --> 15:51.348
We didn't want a chance of missing the child's birth.

15:51.348 --> 15:53.551
- Yeah, she's actually staying with us.

15:53.551 --> 15:55.755
- (laughs) And whose dumbass idea was that?

15:55.755 --> 15:56.724
(Gisele laughs)

15:56.724 --> 15:58.627
- Mine, with your big bald ass.

15:58.627 --> 16:00.097
- [Phillip] Okay, okay.

16:00.097 --> 16:02.267
- See, mm-mm, that's how it starts.

16:02.267 --> 16:03.269
- Yup, they don't know.

16:03.269 --> 16:04.504
- Look, do y'all want us to come?

16:04.504 --> 16:05.540
'Cause we don't mind.

16:05.540 --> 16:06.375
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

16:06.375 --> 16:07.409
(laughs) No.

16:07.409 --> 16:09.213
We?

16:09.213 --> 16:10.382
You know, we can't.

16:10.382 --> 16:12.151
You know, we got plans.

16:12.151 --> 16:15.124
Yeah, with um, uh, whatchamacallit?

16:15.124 --> 16:16.025
Whatchamacallit

16:16.025 --> 16:16.960
- What plans?

16:16.960 --> 16:18.162
- With somebody else.

16:18.162 --> 16:19.732
Babe, you don't remember them plans?

16:19.732 --> 16:21.335
We can't stay here.

16:21.335 --> 16:22.638
- Oh!

16:22.638 --> 16:23.873
Those plans. - Yeah.

16:23.873 --> 16:24.707
Yeah, that one.

16:24.707 --> 16:25.776
I wish I could stay.

16:25.776 --> 16:26.378
- They were canceled. - Yeah...

16:26.378 --> 16:27.546
Huh?

16:27.546 --> 16:28.815
- So, do y'all want us to be here?

16:28.815 --> 16:31.453
- No, no. - Yes, of course, Gisele.

16:31.453 --> 16:35.494
Why wouldn't we want the godparents of our baby to be here?

16:38.299 --> 16:39.701
- [Phillip And Gisele] Godparents?

16:39.701 --> 16:41.305
- Yeah. - Oh snap! (laughs)

16:41.305 --> 16:43.041
- We about to be godparents? - We gon' be godparents.

16:43.041 --> 16:44.109
- Babe, we gon' be...

16:44.109 --> 16:45.045
I'ma be a goddad.

16:45.045 --> 16:46.314
- Yeah, yeah.

16:46.314 --> 16:47.683
- (laughs) I can't believe it, babe.

16:47.683 --> 16:48.818
Wait a minute.

16:48.818 --> 16:49.919
Baby getting emotional, I see it.

16:49.919 --> 16:51.623
- Yeah, you know I am. - I know it.

16:51.623 --> 16:53.592
You know I gotta go buy some stuff now.

16:53.592 --> 16:54.828
- Yes. - All right, listen,

16:54.828 --> 16:56.064
first of all, we gotta get a crib.

16:56.064 --> 16:57.166
- Okay. - Gotta get a crib, right?

16:57.166 --> 16:59.971
And then get a baseball bat and glove.

16:59.971 --> 17:00.906
- Okay. - Wait, wait, wait.

17:00.906 --> 17:02.442
He gon' be a basketball player.

17:03.377 --> 17:04.512
- [Phillip And Gisele] Ballin'!

17:04.512 --> 17:05.348
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:05.348 --> 17:06.450
Oh, no, no, football.

17:06.450 --> 17:07.518
We actually gotta get the helmet

17:07.518 --> 17:08.453
and stuff like that.

17:08.453 --> 17:09.688
And then he gon' grow up.

17:09.688 --> 17:11.258
You know I always wanted to be a dad.

17:11.258 --> 17:12.861
- Yes. - Negro,

17:12.861 --> 17:14.397
I am that baby's father.

17:15.566 --> 17:16.901
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's cool too.

17:16.901 --> 17:19.806
Listen, there's levels to this baby stuff.

17:19.806 --> 17:20.742
- Levels. - Right?

17:20.742 --> 17:22.277
You're just the regular daddy,

17:22.277 --> 17:23.981
and I'm the goddad.

17:23.981 --> 17:25.984
I mean, hence the word.

17:25.984 --> 17:26.986
God.

17:26.986 --> 17:28.222
You know what I'm saying?

17:28.222 --> 17:29.391
It don't get no bigger than that.

17:29.391 --> 17:30.326
- Uh-uh, baby. - I'm going outside.

17:30.326 --> 17:31.561
- You know what I'm saying?

17:31.561 --> 17:32.764
It don't get no bigger than that.

17:32.764 --> 17:33.698
- I'm going outside. - You know what?

17:33.698 --> 17:34.366
He gon' be a basketball player.

17:34.366 --> 17:35.301
He gon' hoop.

17:35.301 --> 17:35.969
I'ma show him how to do it, too.

17:35.969 --> 17:36.771
You know it.

17:36.771 --> 17:37.572
I'ma do you like I do...

17:37.572 --> 17:38.775
Man, come on, man.

17:38.775 --> 17:39.709
- [James] How you know he a boy anyway?

17:39.709 --> 17:40.911
- How he gon' keep doing that?

17:40.911 --> 17:41.846
- Come on, man- - Girl, they crazy.

17:41.846 --> 17:43.817
- No, both of y'all are crazy.

17:43.817 --> 17:47.122
- So, I know you didn't wanna say anything to anybody,

17:47.122 --> 17:50.429
but do you know what y'all having?

17:50.429 --> 17:52.065
- Yes.

17:52.065 --> 17:53.500
It's gonna be a baby boy.

17:53.500 --> 17:55.404
- Oh, yay! (clapping)

17:55.404 --> 17:56.740
Congratulations.

17:57.842 --> 17:59.878
So, what y'all gonna name him?

17:59.878 --> 18:04.821
- Okay, so I'm thinking James Kobe Derrell Smith. (laughs)

18:07.025 --> 18:07.893
- Kobe?

18:07.893 --> 18:09.096
- Yeah, girl.

18:09.096 --> 18:11.633
That's James' favorite basketball player.

18:11.633 --> 18:13.670
- I thought James played baseball?

18:13.670 --> 18:15.407
- Yeah, he does. - Oh.

18:15.407 --> 18:17.845
Okay, well Kobe is good, girl.

18:17.845 --> 18:19.280
Hey, if y'all like it, I love it.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.216
Okay, Kobe.

18:20.216 --> 18:21.551
Kobe was a good player.

18:21.551 --> 18:22.820
That's cool.

18:22.820 --> 18:23.922
So what time do you need us to be here?

18:23.922 --> 18:25.592
- Let's say 5:30. - Okay.

18:25.592 --> 18:26.527
- Actually, no, 4:30.

18:26.527 --> 18:28.063
Just come as soon as you can.

18:28.063 --> 18:29.165
- I mean, well that's perfect.

18:29.165 --> 18:30.868
We'll be here. - Okay.

18:30.868 --> 18:35.810
- So, how's everything been going with counseling?

18:35.810 --> 18:38.983
Has he been able to repair y'all's marriage?

18:38.983 --> 18:41.654
- You know, it went well.

18:41.654 --> 18:45.227
And I'm just glad that we got through it.

18:45.227 --> 18:48.901
So now we can focus on healing and being a family.

18:50.036 --> 18:51.972
- And you think you can forgive him?

18:54.443 --> 18:57.148
(Carmen sighs)

18:57.148 --> 18:58.717
- We all make mistakes.

18:59.853 --> 19:02.291
And I'm just focusing on moving forward.

19:03.593 --> 19:04.428
- Okay, girl.

19:04.428 --> 19:06.799
I'll toast to that.

19:06.799 --> 19:08.836
- Clink, clink. - Oh, no, no, no, no.

19:08.836 --> 19:12.643
You know it's bad luck to not toast with alcohol, right?

19:12.643 --> 19:15.682
- Under these circumstances, I think it's fine.

19:15.682 --> 19:17.418
- I guess you get a pass. (Carmen laughs)

19:17.418 --> 19:19.755
Congratulations. - Thank you.

19:29.373 --> 19:31.243
(slow music)

19:31.243 --> 19:33.647
Mm. (laughs)

19:34.782 --> 19:35.618
Yo.

19:37.153 --> 19:37.989
- My goodness.

19:37.989 --> 19:39.591
That was crazy.

19:39.591 --> 19:40.860
- What was crazy, baby?

19:42.196 --> 19:45.168
- This man Phillip was trying to convince me

19:45.168 --> 19:46.638
on what to name our child.

19:46.638 --> 19:48.641
- Oh my god. - No, for real.

19:48.641 --> 19:52.915
He came up with names like LeBron, Usher.

19:52.915 --> 19:54.385
- What? - Goku.

19:54.385 --> 19:55.987
(Carmen laughs)

19:55.987 --> 19:57.256
- But what if it's a girl?

19:57.256 --> 19:58.793
- Oh, he had names for that too.

19:58.793 --> 20:00.663
Serena, Rihanna.

20:01.798 --> 20:04.102
Oh, he even said Megan, but not just Megan,

20:04.102 --> 20:06.674
Megan Thee Stallion. (Carmen laughs)

20:06.674 --> 20:08.643
I spent the last 30 minutes

20:08.643 --> 20:10.414
trying to convince him to shut the hell up.

20:10.414 --> 20:12.918
- Well, that's your crazy homeboy Phillip.

20:12.918 --> 20:15.389
- Yeah, I love him though.

20:15.389 --> 20:16.858
- Oh. - What's wrong?

20:16.858 --> 20:18.094
What's wrong?

20:18.094 --> 20:19.129
- The baby just kicked the shit out of me.

20:19.129 --> 20:20.799
- For real? Let me see.

20:20.799 --> 20:21.867
- Oh.

20:21.867 --> 20:24.138
- That's a kick. - You feel it?

20:24.138 --> 20:26.075
- Wait, is it a boy?

20:26.075 --> 20:27.678
- Mm-mm-mm.

20:27.678 --> 20:29.381
- No, for real, is it a boy?

20:29.381 --> 20:32.286
- Baby, seriously, I don't know.

20:32.286 --> 20:33.923
- Mm-hmm.

20:33.923 --> 20:35.125
(Carmen laughs)

20:35.125 --> 20:37.128
- Okay, look, I'm about to go take a shower

20:37.128 --> 20:38.798
and get in the bed.

20:38.798 --> 20:40.134
Are you gonna do the dishes?

20:40.134 --> 20:41.603
- Yeah, with you included

20:41.603 --> 20:43.206
- Oh.

20:43.206 --> 20:44.007
Okay.

20:45.110 --> 20:46.412
No.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.181
The baby's about to come in a few days.

20:48.181 --> 20:49.517
- No, for real.

20:49.517 --> 20:52.556
I heard, I mean, I read in a book

20:52.556 --> 20:56.095
that it actually helps with the pushing.

20:56.095 --> 20:57.364
- Oh, it helps with the pushing.

20:57.364 --> 21:00.604
- Yeah, it's actually good for the both of us.

21:00.604 --> 21:02.073
- Okay.

21:02.073 --> 21:06.348
Well, you hurry up so we can get to pushing. (laughs)

21:07.082 --> 21:09.119
Or I'ma be asleep.

21:09.119 --> 21:10.855
All right, chop chop.

21:12.158 --> 21:14.996
(dishes clanking)

21:16.733 --> 21:20.006
(slow music continues)

21:29.656 --> 21:32.662
(suspenseful music)

21:33.897 --> 21:37.303
- I can't wait to meet you come, my love.

21:53.967 --> 21:57.507
(Carmen breathing heavily)

22:00.812 --> 22:01.680
James?

22:01.680 --> 22:02.983
- Baby, what's wrong?

22:02.983 --> 22:05.554
It's like three in the morning.

22:10.930 --> 22:12.032
This is nice.

22:15.505 --> 22:16.974
- I'll be back.

22:16.974 --> 22:18.778
- Where you going?

22:18.778 --> 22:19.979
- To get some ice cream.

22:20.814 --> 22:22.652
- All right.

22:22.652 --> 22:23.486
Come on.

22:26.458 --> 22:28.562
(Carmen sighs)

22:28.562 --> 22:29.630
There you go.

22:32.468 --> 22:33.838
I love you.

22:33.838 --> 22:35.241
- I love you too.

22:43.221 --> 22:46.728
(phone keyboard clacking)

22:53.841 --> 22:56.813
(suspenseful music)

23:22.559 --> 23:25.164
(bright music)

23:42.027 --> 23:45.033
(suspenseful music)

23:48.372 --> 23:50.976
(bright music)

24:43.671 --> 24:46.242
(bright music)

25:09.418 --> 25:10.787
- Hey, baby.

25:10.787 --> 25:12.056
- Good morning.

25:26.582 --> 25:27.383
James?

25:28.485 --> 25:29.854
James?

25:29.854 --> 25:30.723
Hello?

25:30.723 --> 25:31.925
James? - Sorry, baby.

25:32.994 --> 25:34.529
Sorry.

25:34.529 --> 25:35.365
It's all right.

25:36.967 --> 25:37.969
Food good, ain't it?

25:40.474 --> 25:43.045
- So who were you on the phone with outside?

25:43.045 --> 25:45.216
It sounded like y'all were arguing about something.

25:48.354 --> 25:49.356
- Yeah, that was...

25:50.725 --> 25:52.194
That was just Phillip.

25:52.194 --> 25:53.030
- Phillip.

25:54.165 --> 25:55.034
- Yes, Phillip.

25:58.105 --> 26:00.276
(tapping)

26:02.714 --> 26:04.350
- James.

26:04.350 --> 26:07.255
I love you, but I can't go through this again.

26:07.255 --> 26:08.457
- Go through what again?

26:09.326 --> 26:10.828
(fork clatters)

26:10.828 --> 26:12.331
- The lies, the cheating, the random phone calls.

26:12.331 --> 26:13.166
I can't do it!

26:13.166 --> 26:14.001
- Carmen.

26:15.837 --> 26:17.306
We already went through this.

26:19.410 --> 26:20.980
We went to counseling for this.

26:22.248 --> 26:24.820
Look, I made a mistake, all right?

26:24.820 --> 26:25.655
But I'm here now.

26:33.702 --> 26:35.840
- So if I was to ask to look at your phone?

26:51.668 --> 26:53.538
Well, what did Phillip want?

26:55.909 --> 26:57.913
- You know Phillip.

26:57.913 --> 27:01.920
Said he got ideas for the baby name and all that.

27:04.758 --> 27:06.729
Enough about all that, though.

27:06.729 --> 27:09.500
Let's get back to this food before it get cold.

27:15.445 --> 27:18.583
- Now that was real good, baby.

27:18.583 --> 27:19.952
I see you getting better.

27:19.952 --> 27:20.787
- Mm-hmm.

27:21.889 --> 27:23.927
YouTube links finally paying off.

27:23.927 --> 27:25.362
Shoot. (chuckles)

27:25.362 --> 27:27.600
I ain't as good as you yet, but I'm getting there.

27:27.600 --> 27:29.136
- Oh, so we gon' have to have a cook-off.

27:29.136 --> 27:34.145
- Shoot, maybe. (phone chimes)

27:35.581 --> 27:37.751
Look, I'm about to go take a shower real quick, all right?

27:37.751 --> 27:39.354
I'll be right back.

27:40.723 --> 27:41.558
- Okay.

27:50.207 --> 27:53.045
(water splashing)

27:59.056 --> 28:02.028
(suspenseful music)

28:23.600 --> 28:26.272
(door creaking)

28:49.647 --> 28:51.684
- You know I'd never hurt you again, right?

28:54.656 --> 28:56.727
Look, we were going through a rough patch

28:56.727 --> 28:57.996
and I messed up big time.

29:02.270 --> 29:04.707
But Carmen, you mean everything to me.

29:06.076 --> 29:08.180
You're bringing our child into this world.

29:09.116 --> 29:11.820
(bright music)

29:11.820 --> 29:14.492
I'll never hurt you again, ever.

29:19.901 --> 29:21.003
- Okay, baby.

29:23.708 --> 29:25.378
- Do you believe me?

29:30.254 --> 29:31.589
- I believe you.

29:33.125 --> 29:34.528
- Do you love me?

29:37.032 --> 29:38.468
- Do you love me?

29:39.503 --> 29:40.339
- I do.

29:43.878 --> 29:46.048
- [Carmen] I love you too.

29:52.059 --> 29:54.230
(kissing)

29:57.168 --> 29:59.272
- No, no, take your time.

30:10.826 --> 30:13.498
(door shutting)

30:26.087 --> 30:28.859
(birds chirping)

30:53.169 --> 30:56.141
(car door shutting)

30:57.243 --> 30:58.045
- James?

30:59.848 --> 31:00.749
James.

31:08.998 --> 31:09.832
James!

31:11.503 --> 31:14.941
Oh my gosh, baby.

31:14.941 --> 31:16.445
What is it?

31:16.445 --> 31:18.314
- [James] I don't know, let's find out.

31:18.314 --> 31:19.750
- Okay. - All right?

31:20.819 --> 31:23.657
(paper crinkling)

31:34.544 --> 31:35.946
So what you think, baby?

31:35.946 --> 31:37.816
- Baby, I love it.

31:37.816 --> 31:39.386
(both laughing)

31:39.386 --> 31:40.788
So when did you buy it?

31:40.788 --> 31:42.357
- I didn't.

31:42.357 --> 31:45.263
- Wait, so did Gisele and Phillip get it?

31:45.263 --> 31:47.066
- No, it's from the midwife.

31:47.066 --> 31:48.335
Woke up this morning,

31:48.335 --> 31:50.606
found that box outside and this attached to it.

31:52.175 --> 31:53.578
- The midwife? - Yeah.

31:56.283 --> 31:58.821
- "Congratulations to the future mom and dad."

32:00.891 --> 32:02.160
- Mm-hmm.

32:02.160 --> 32:03.128
- But baby, how did she get our address?

32:03.128 --> 32:04.497
We haven't given it to her yet.

32:04.497 --> 32:05.766
- You're asking too many questions.

32:05.766 --> 32:06.902
It's free.

32:06.902 --> 32:08.371
You know how expensive these are.

32:08.371 --> 32:09.640
- You're so damn cheap.

32:11.009 --> 32:12.478
- You know it.

32:12.478 --> 32:15.050
(Carmen sighs)

32:22.463 --> 32:25.035
(upbeat music)

33:09.815 --> 33:11.251
All right, I know you got one.

33:11.251 --> 33:12.687
You got an eight?

33:13.555 --> 33:15.092
- Damn.

33:15.092 --> 33:15.926
- Yeah.

33:15.926 --> 33:17.195
Okay.

33:17.195 --> 33:18.597
- That's the last match you getting.

33:18.597 --> 33:20.401
- Yeah, yeah.

33:20.401 --> 33:21.436
I'm coming back.

33:21.436 --> 33:22.270
- Okay.

33:23.974 --> 33:25.477
You got a three?

33:25.477 --> 33:26.779
- Nope.

33:26.779 --> 33:28.515
- You lying. - Go fish.

33:30.552 --> 33:31.888
- (laughs) Another match.

33:34.593 --> 33:36.229
- All right, you got a six?

33:37.464 --> 33:38.733
- No.

33:38.733 --> 33:40.103
Dive in.

33:40.103 --> 33:40.904
- Fine.

33:42.039 --> 33:43.675
- Baby, how much longer on the food?

33:46.448 --> 33:47.917
- About an hour.

33:47.917 --> 33:49.553
- An hour?

33:49.553 --> 33:51.222
What time did you start cooking?

33:52.158 --> 33:54.662
- About an hour. - Oh my gosh.

33:54.662 --> 33:57.333
(ominous music)

34:00.573 --> 34:02.476
- I really did have a three, too.

34:02.476 --> 34:05.081
- I'm about to go pee. (laughs)

34:05.081 --> 34:08.520
- Probably 'cause you know you about to lose.

34:08.520 --> 34:10.691
(tapping)

34:12.494 --> 34:13.396
She got us.

34:16.034 --> 34:17.303
She...

34:17.303 --> 34:19.774
Man, you gotta have one of these cards.

34:19.774 --> 34:20.609
A two.

34:24.783 --> 34:29.792
(knocking on door) (suspenseful music)

35:13.404 --> 35:15.308
- Is everything okay, baby?

35:15.308 --> 35:16.242
- Yeah.

35:16.242 --> 35:17.812
Thought I heard something.

35:17.812 --> 35:19.214
Probably just a deer.

35:19.214 --> 35:20.350
Go ahead, go back in the house.

35:20.350 --> 35:22.086
- You sure?

35:22.086 --> 35:23.322
- Positive.

35:23.322 --> 35:24.557
- Look, go find us something to watch.

35:24.557 --> 35:27.028
I'll be in in a minute, all right?

35:27.028 --> 35:29.766
- Okay, 'cause you know I got your back.

35:31.069 --> 35:31.904
- I know.

35:40.353 --> 35:42.957
(box clatters)

35:54.945 --> 35:58.551
(Carmen groaning)

35:58.551 --> 35:59.387
What's wrong?

35:59.387 --> 36:00.355
What's wrong, baby?

36:00.355 --> 36:01.624
- I don't know.

36:03.895 --> 36:04.729
- Breathe in and out.

36:04.729 --> 36:06.232
Just breathe in and out.

36:06.232 --> 36:07.067
Should I call the midwife?

36:07.067 --> 36:07.902
Is it time?

36:08.837 --> 36:10.340
- I don't think so.

36:10.340 --> 36:13.178
(Carmen inhaling)

36:15.315 --> 36:16.484
- What's that smell?

36:19.156 --> 36:19.990
- Sorry.

36:21.293 --> 36:25.000
- Oh, that is just foul. (Carmen laughs)

36:25.000 --> 36:26.969
Oh my goodness.

36:26.969 --> 36:27.905
- What?

36:27.905 --> 36:29.074
It wasn't me, it was the baby.

36:29.074 --> 36:30.643
- You can't blame everything on the baby.

36:30.643 --> 36:31.945
- And why can't I?

36:32.814 --> 36:33.648
- Oh my goodness.

36:34.583 --> 36:36.720
You nasty.

36:38.356 --> 36:40.027
- Can you do us a favor?

36:40.027 --> 36:40.861
- What's that?

36:41.930 --> 36:43.532
- ice cream.

36:43.532 --> 36:44.734
We need more ice cream.

36:47.172 --> 36:48.441
- My kid needs some more ice cream?

36:48.441 --> 36:49.844
- Mm-hmm.

36:49.844 --> 36:50.812
- What flavor?

36:50.812 --> 36:53.751
Vanilla, strawberry, chocolate?

36:56.356 --> 36:59.328
- Cookies and cream. - Cookies and cream, huh?

36:59.328 --> 37:00.530
- Mm-hmm.

37:00.530 --> 37:01.365
- Let me see.

37:02.466 --> 37:03.568
Is that what you want?

37:03.568 --> 37:05.506
Some cookies and cream?

37:05.506 --> 37:06.341
Huh?

37:07.843 --> 37:08.845
All right.

37:08.845 --> 37:11.250
Cookies and cream it is, then.

37:11.250 --> 37:13.921
But babe, you do know that the closest store

37:13.921 --> 37:15.323
is like, 20 minutes away.

37:16.592 --> 37:18.162
- Yeah, I know.

37:19.564 --> 37:21.835
But we really need some cookies and cream ice cream.

37:21.835 --> 37:23.037
- Oh my god.

37:23.037 --> 37:24.239
All right, well I'll go get the keys.

37:24.239 --> 37:26.009
Look, keep your phone on you, all right?

37:26.009 --> 37:27.746
Call me if you need anything.

37:27.746 --> 37:30.150
I mean anything, all right? - Okay.

37:30.150 --> 37:31.486
- All right. - All right.

37:33.022 --> 37:34.024
- All right.

37:35.159 --> 37:36.695

40:09.102 --> 40:11.707
(Carmen sighs)

40:13.176 --> 40:15.447
Thank you. - Of course.

40:15.447 --> 40:17.585
- So, you're the midwife?

40:17.585 --> 40:19.054
- Yeah, Monica Harris.

40:20.423 --> 40:21.892
You know, your husband called me

40:21.892 --> 40:23.461
and told me to come in early to check in on you.

40:23.461 --> 40:26.267
- Wait, you've spoken to my husband, James?

40:26.267 --> 40:29.005
I've been trying to call him but he hasn't answered.

40:29.005 --> 40:30.541
- Oh, I'm sure he's fine.

40:30.541 --> 40:32.277
It's really bad service out here

40:32.277 --> 40:33.646
in these neck of the woods.

40:35.350 --> 40:37.086
- Yes, I guess you're right.

40:37.086 --> 40:38.990
- [Monica] I'm sure it's nothing to worry about.

40:40.392 --> 40:42.362
- Well, did you call me to make sure

40:42.362 --> 40:43.664
that you were on your way?

40:43.664 --> 40:46.035
I don't remember getting a missed call from you.

40:46.035 --> 40:48.774
- Actually, my service out here is pretty bad too.

40:48.774 --> 40:51.746
I tried giving you a call but it went straight to voicemail.

40:52.748 --> 40:54.350
Didn't even ring once.

40:55.519 --> 40:57.422
- Well, I guess that makes sense too.

40:57.422 --> 40:59.693
Service is stupid out here.

41:03.733 --> 41:07.675
- So I take it this is the father, am I right?

41:07.675 --> 41:10.046
- [Carmen] Yep, that's the culprit in question.

41:12.784 --> 41:13.752
- Beautiful couple.

41:15.655 --> 41:16.457
- Thank you.

41:20.464 --> 41:22.935
(glass shattering) - Oh!

41:22.935 --> 41:24.438
Oh my god, girl, I'm so sorry.

41:24.438 --> 41:25.640
I got glass everywhere.

41:25.640 --> 41:26.709
- No, no, no, don't worry about it.

41:26.709 --> 41:27.877
I'll clean it up later.

41:27.877 --> 41:29.981
It's fine. - I'm so sorry.

41:30.882 --> 41:34.222
Oh, speaking of, where is he?

41:34.222 --> 41:36.326
- He was just supposed to make a quick run

41:36.326 --> 41:37.996
to the grocery store for some ice cream,

41:37.996 --> 41:41.402
but I haven't heard from him since.

41:41.402 --> 41:44.040
- Huh. (Carmen sighs)

41:45.109 --> 41:46.277
- Is that your only bag?

41:47.513 --> 41:49.016
- Oh yeah, that's all I really need for now.

41:49.016 --> 41:50.752
The rest of my things are in the car.

41:50.752 --> 41:52.021
I'll get it later.

41:52.021 --> 41:53.858
- Oh, well, do you need any help?

41:53.858 --> 41:55.293
- No.

41:55.293 --> 41:56.496
You relax.

41:56.496 --> 41:57.363
I got it.

41:57.363 --> 41:58.867
- Are you sure?

41:58.867 --> 42:01.672
You know, I may be pregnant but I still got super strength.

42:01.672 --> 42:02.573
- I'm positive.

42:03.541 --> 42:05.812
You just hang tight, okay?

42:05.812 --> 42:08.250
(Carmen sighs)

42:08.250 --> 42:11.155
So what are you guys gonna name him?

42:11.155 --> 42:12.725
- Him?

42:12.725 --> 42:14.828
How do you know it's a baby boy?

42:14.828 --> 42:16.665
I don't remember telling you that.

42:16.665 --> 42:18.268
- Oh, you know...

42:19.670 --> 42:21.407
You know, I've been doing this for a long time,

42:21.407 --> 42:24.412
and when the belly sits low like that, like a basketball,

42:25.614 --> 42:28.419
it typically means the woman is having a boy,

42:28.419 --> 42:30.256
versus when she's having a girl.

42:30.256 --> 42:31.325
Everyone knows that.

42:32.293 --> 42:33.863
- (laughs) Interesting.

42:33.863 --> 42:35.232
I didn't know that.

42:35.232 --> 42:38.738
But no, we haven't came up with a name just yet.

42:38.738 --> 42:40.274
I have something in mind,

42:40.274 --> 42:43.646
but we're gonna wait until we see his beautiful face

42:43.646 --> 42:46.084
and name him whatever comes to our hearts.

42:46.084 --> 42:47.386
- Oh.

42:47.386 --> 42:50.960
How cute. (laughs)

42:50.960 --> 42:53.431
(Carmen yawns)

42:53.431 --> 42:56.904
- Oh my gosh, where is James and this ice cream?

42:58.406 --> 43:00.477
- Maybe he stopped by the store or something.

43:00.477 --> 43:02.347
You know how men get.

43:02.347 --> 43:03.984
They're easily distracted, girl.

43:03.984 --> 43:05.253
- What?

43:05.253 --> 43:08.158
No, this is really unusual.

43:09.860 --> 43:12.733
- Do you want me to get you something from the kitchen?

43:12.733 --> 43:14.102
- Yes, please.

43:14.102 --> 43:16.038
I think that would really calm my nerves.

43:16.038 --> 43:17.207
- Okay.

43:17.207 --> 43:18.442
- Could you just bring me the sandwich

43:18.442 --> 43:19.578
that I've already made in the kitchen?

43:19.578 --> 43:20.513
- [Monica] Of course.

43:20.513 --> 43:21.816
- And maybe something to drink?

43:21.816 --> 43:22.651
- [Monica] Of course.

43:22.651 --> 43:23.853
Coming right up.

43:23.853 --> 43:24.687
- Thank you.

43:27.358 --> 43:30.198
(Carmen groaning)

43:42.653 --> 43:44.022
Are you okay in there?

43:44.890 --> 43:46.393
- Yeah, I'm fine.

43:46.393 --> 43:47.896
Your sandwich wasn't fresh,

43:47.896 --> 43:50.033
so I'm making you a new one.

43:51.201 --> 43:53.773
A nice little lemonade,

43:53.773 --> 43:55.243
(suspenseful music)

43:55.243 --> 43:56.378
coming right up.

44:10.270 --> 44:11.104
Okay.

44:26.231 --> 44:27.834
All right.

44:27.834 --> 44:29.804
- Thank you so much. - Of course.

44:29.804 --> 44:30.940
Of course, of course.

44:30.940 --> 44:34.680
- Girl, this looks good. (Monica laughs)

44:34.680 --> 44:36.182
Mm, mm, mm.

44:36.182 --> 44:39.121
- Here, wash that down with some lemonade.

44:39.121 --> 44:39.956
Yeah.

44:46.501 --> 44:47.336
- Mm.

44:48.371 --> 44:50.542
Girl, this is really good.

44:51.877 --> 44:55.684
You know, I haven't had homemade lemonade in some years.

44:55.684 --> 44:58.389
- Well, you know, it's my specialty.

44:58.389 --> 44:59.691
Not only will it help you,

44:59.691 --> 45:02.864
but it'll help this little bun in the oven.

45:02.864 --> 45:05.202
Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink.

45:05.202 --> 45:06.036
- Mm.

45:08.173 --> 45:09.609
This hit the spot. - Mm-hmm.

45:10.911 --> 45:13.016
- Well, thank you so much, Monica.

45:13.016 --> 45:14.318
- Of course.

45:14.318 --> 45:16.522
- You know, please don't be offended,

45:16.522 --> 45:20.162
but you know, you sound a little different from the phone.

45:20.162 --> 45:23.000
Can you just tell me some more about yourself

45:23.000 --> 45:24.870
and how long you been doing this again?

45:24.870 --> 45:26.740
- I've been doing this for a long time.

45:28.143 --> 45:30.914
You're in good hands, trust me.

45:30.914 --> 45:32.016
- That's good to know.

45:33.419 --> 45:36.258
Oh, girl, you know, nature is calling.

45:36.258 --> 45:38.161
Lemonade got this bladder running.

45:39.329 --> 45:40.465
- Do you need some help?

45:40.465 --> 45:41.667
- Nah, I got it.

45:41.667 --> 45:43.603
- You sure? - Yeah.

45:43.603 --> 45:44.539
- Okay.

45:45.808 --> 45:48.980
Scream if you need me. (laughs)

45:48.980 --> 45:50.083
- Okay, girl.

45:55.192 --> 45:57.963
(door opening)

45:57.963 --> 46:02.939
(Monica chuckles) (door closing)

46:10.319 --> 46:12.990
(Carmen groans)

46:15.728 --> 46:18.500
- I'm gonna kick your daddy's ass.

46:22.808 --> 46:24.944
James, where are you?

46:26.113 --> 46:27.783
We can't get through this without you.

46:30.188 --> 46:32.926
(dramatic music)

46:57.537 --> 47:00.842
(Monica laughs)

47:00.842 --> 47:03.447
(intense music)

47:20.378 --> 47:23.116
(birds chirping)

47:27.023 --> 47:29.160
(midwife sighs)

47:29.160 --> 47:31.398
(knocking)

47:33.802 --> 47:35.605
- Hello?

47:35.605 --> 47:37.475
It's your midwife.

47:37.475 --> 47:39.712
(knocking)

47:45.690 --> 47:48.161
Is everything okay in there?

47:50.699 --> 47:52.569
(knocking)

47:52.569 --> 47:53.838
Hello?

47:57.578 --> 47:58.814
(midwife gasps) (slicing)

47:58.814 --> 48:02.554
(wings flapping) (birds chirping)

48:02.554 --> 48:03.522
(Carmen screaming)

48:03.522 --> 48:05.125
- Somebody help me!

48:05.125 --> 48:07.028
Somebody help me!

48:07.028 --> 48:09.032
Help me! (whimpers)

48:09.032 --> 48:13.473
Somebody help me! (suspenseful music)

48:14.842 --> 48:17.514
(door opening)

48:17.514 --> 48:20.653
(door closing)

48:20.653 --> 48:22.590
- Good morning, Carmen.

48:24.293 --> 48:25.628
How'd you sleep?

48:26.664 --> 48:28.233
Good, I know.

48:28.233 --> 48:31.373
That was my specialty lemonade.

48:31.373 --> 48:35.079
Now, I'm gonna remove this handkerchief,

48:36.180 --> 48:38.184
and when I do, you better not make a sound,

48:39.987 --> 48:42.559
or you'll be eating and drinking from a damn straw.

48:43.494 --> 48:44.329
Understand?

48:45.698 --> 48:48.069
Nod your head yes if you understand.

48:53.445 --> 48:55.115
Good, now.

48:55.115 --> 48:56.351
All right, now.

48:57.686 --> 48:58.789
You better not scream.

49:02.094 --> 49:03.329
- You crazy bitch!

49:04.498 --> 49:06.669
- Do you talk to your mother with that mouth?

49:06.669 --> 49:08.038
- What the hell are you doing to me?

49:08.038 --> 49:08.873
Let me go!

49:12.212 --> 49:15.752
- I'll let you go as soon as we deliver our baby.

49:17.254 --> 49:18.457
- Our baby?

49:18.457 --> 49:20.627
What the hell do you mean, our baby?

49:20.627 --> 49:22.665
- Oh. (laughs)

49:23.499 --> 49:24.835
Well, really my baby.

49:26.505 --> 49:27.306
Oh...

49:27.306 --> 49:28.976
Hey.

49:28.976 --> 49:30.212
- Bitch, you're freakin' crazy.

49:30.212 --> 49:31.881
Don't you know that?

49:33.383 --> 49:34.719
- Yeah.

49:34.719 --> 49:37.959
Actually, (laughs) I do.

49:37.959 --> 49:40.563
Tell me something I don't know.

49:42.099 --> 49:43.936
- What is that on you?

49:45.739 --> 49:47.375
- Oh.

49:47.375 --> 49:48.310
Oh, this.

49:48.310 --> 49:52.351
Oh, it's just blood. (laughs)

49:52.351 --> 49:53.253
- From who?

49:56.392 --> 49:58.295
Bitch, I said from who!

50:01.868 --> 50:05.475
(Carmen breathing heavily)

50:06.310 --> 50:08.313
- All right now, Carmen.

50:11.519 --> 50:12.353
Open wide!

50:14.724 --> 50:16.060
Come on.

50:16.060 --> 50:19.733
Choo-choo. (imitates train chugging)

50:19.733 --> 50:20.569
Oh.

50:22.573 --> 50:24.742
You can't keep doing this!

50:25.744 --> 50:27.748
You're gonna starve my baby.

50:27.748 --> 50:29.585
Don't you understand that?

50:29.585 --> 50:31.187
Think about what you're doing, you hear me?

50:31.187 --> 50:32.624
Think about this.

50:32.624 --> 50:34.527
You need to eat.

50:34.527 --> 50:36.297
Eat, dammit.

50:36.297 --> 50:41.306
- Eat shit! (sputters)

50:44.111 --> 50:46.315
- Listen, if you don't eat,

50:48.118 --> 50:50.389
I'm gonna cut that baby out my damn self.

50:50.389 --> 50:51.591
Do you hear me?

50:54.229 --> 50:56.967
I'm trying to be nice about this.

50:59.305 --> 51:01.809
Don't make me get nasty.

51:01.809 --> 51:03.245
Do you understand?

51:05.082 --> 51:06.585
Do you understand?

51:09.189 --> 51:10.025
- Yes.

51:11.260 --> 51:12.395
Yes.

51:12.395 --> 51:13.463
- Good.

51:13.463 --> 51:14.298
Good.

51:15.300 --> 51:16.469
That's better.

51:17.470 --> 51:18.305
See?

51:19.908 --> 51:22.714
That wasn't that hard, was it?

51:22.714 --> 51:25.352
All it takes is a little cooperation.

51:25.352 --> 51:26.186
Now,

51:28.290 --> 51:29.125
open wide.

51:30.461 --> 51:32.097
Come on.

51:32.097 --> 51:32.932
Uh-huh.

51:32.932 --> 51:33.767
Ah.

51:33.767 --> 51:34.601
Say "Ah."

51:35.870 --> 51:37.440
Ah.

51:37.440 --> 51:38.275
Ah, yeah.

51:39.777 --> 51:42.082
Very good, very good.

51:42.082 --> 51:42.917
All right.

51:42.917 --> 51:43.752
One more.

51:45.755 --> 51:46.790
Ah.

51:46.790 --> 51:48.093
There we go, ah.

51:48.093 --> 51:50.997
Mm. (laughs)

51:50.997 --> 51:51.966
See?

51:51.966 --> 51:53.535
That wasn't so hard ,was it?

51:55.206 --> 51:57.175
Oh, gosh.

51:57.175 --> 51:58.211
This is stressful.

52:01.250 --> 52:02.853
- I need to pee, now.

52:04.355 --> 52:05.257
- Well go ahead.

52:06.125 --> 52:07.661
- Uncuff me, bitch.

52:10.500 --> 52:13.004
- You know, I really hate when you use that word.

52:14.573 --> 52:16.410
- I don't give a fuck.

52:30.035 --> 52:32.873
(Carmen whimpers)

52:34.476 --> 52:35.812
- Hey, watch it.

52:39.685 --> 52:40.520
Go.

52:45.830 --> 52:46.665
Hurry up.

52:46.665 --> 52:48.634
- Shut the hell up!

52:48.634 --> 52:49.903
(Carmen yells)

52:49.903 --> 52:50.738
- Oh.

52:51.674 --> 52:53.143
That's okay.

52:53.143 --> 52:53.945
You're fine.

52:56.516 --> 52:57.651
Keep crawling.

52:59.321 --> 53:00.122
Hurry up!

53:01.258 --> 53:02.694
(Carmen screaming)

53:02.694 --> 53:05.599
(suspenseful music)

53:39.426 --> 53:40.261
Relax.

53:42.732 --> 53:45.771
(Monica sighs)

53:45.771 --> 53:46.606
Fresh air.

53:47.775 --> 53:49.844
(inhales) Smells good, doesn't it?

53:51.848 --> 53:53.318
(Monica chuckles)

53:53.318 --> 53:55.722
- What the hell do you want from me?

53:56.624 --> 53:58.427
Just let me go, please.

53:59.362 --> 54:00.998
I promise, I won't tell anybody.

54:03.035 --> 54:05.139
- For the last time,

54:06.575 --> 54:09.947
I'll let you go when you finish delivering my baby.

54:13.989 --> 54:16.293
- This is my baby.

54:16.293 --> 54:19.131
No one is taking my baby.

54:19.131 --> 54:21.435
You're gonna have to kill me first, bitch.

54:23.806 --> 54:26.176
- You better be careful what you wish for,

54:27.145 --> 54:28.614
'cause you just might get it.

54:31.587 --> 54:33.723
You know, this is all James' fault.

54:35.127 --> 54:38.265
- And what does James have to do with this, huh?

54:38.265 --> 54:40.336
- Now, you don't know anything, do you?

54:42.640 --> 54:43.574
Poor baby.

54:45.779 --> 54:47.682
(Monica sighs)

54:47.682 --> 54:48.650
Look at this.

54:52.892 --> 54:55.730
This is me when I was pregnant with my first child.

55:02.175 --> 55:03.377
This is my ultrasound.

55:08.887 --> 55:12.193
This is me at three months,

55:12.193 --> 55:15.866
doing that same yoga shit that you were doing.

55:17.302 --> 55:19.039
- And what does this shut have to do with me, huh?

55:19.039 --> 55:22.411
- Hey, I'm getting to it, antsy-pants.

55:22.411 --> 55:23.346
- Well hurry the hell up!

55:23.346 --> 55:25.851
I need to use the restroom.

55:25.851 --> 55:27.788
- You just came from the damn restroom.

55:29.290 --> 55:32.429
Your husband was the father of my child!

55:39.642 --> 55:40.477
Until.

55:43.682 --> 55:44.784
- Until what?

55:50.562 --> 55:53.700
- Until I had a miscarriage.

55:53.700 --> 55:55.604
- [Carmen] What?

55:55.604 --> 55:57.742
- [Monica] He threw me on the ground.

55:59.978 --> 56:01.214
Said he didn't wanna have my baby

56:01.214 --> 56:04.320
and that he doesn't love me and he never will.

56:05.822 --> 56:07.025
Your James did that.

56:08.594 --> 56:11.232
So I'm here to take what's mine.

56:11.232 --> 56:12.067
Mine.

56:15.640 --> 56:16.475
- You know what?

56:17.878 --> 56:18.712
You're right.

56:20.950 --> 56:22.085
It's your baby.

56:23.588 --> 56:25.024
Look, I'm so sorry for your loss.

56:28.296 --> 56:29.398
- So you understand?

56:30.334 --> 56:31.769
- Yes.

56:31.769 --> 56:34.441
(Monica crying)

56:37.580 --> 56:39.516
(ominous music)

56:39.516 --> 56:41.654
- What the hell is that? - Hey, hey.

56:41.654 --> 56:43.390
Relax, okay?

56:43.390 --> 56:44.626
It's for the baby.

56:44.626 --> 56:46.429
- No, please stop!

56:46.429 --> 56:47.898
- It'll induce the labor.

56:47.898 --> 56:48.733
- No!

56:51.805 --> 56:54.043
Stop!

56:54.043 --> 56:57.883
- There we go.

56:57.883 --> 56:59.219
Get your ass up.

57:01.790 --> 57:03.326
- [Carmen] Stop it.

57:08.803 --> 57:10.873
- Now, you hang tight,

57:12.342 --> 57:14.279
and I'll be right back.

57:15.748 --> 57:18.954
(dishes clanking)

57:18.954 --> 57:20.123
Okay, Carmen.

57:21.359 --> 57:22.561
What do you want to eat?

57:25.199 --> 57:26.033
Fine.

57:27.235 --> 57:29.606
I baked us this cake for us to celebrate

57:29.606 --> 57:31.711
the birth of my baby boy.

57:32.679 --> 57:34.882
But first...

57:34.882 --> 57:36.920
(Monica humming)

57:36.920 --> 57:39.191
(ominous music)

57:39.191 --> 57:40.026
Now,

57:42.162 --> 57:45.802
before I cut the cake, we sing.

57:45.802 --> 57:48.040
Okay? - Okay.

57:48.040 --> 57:51.380
♪ Congratulations to me

57:52.915 --> 57:57.356
♪ Congratulations to you ♪ Congratulations to me

57:57.356 --> 58:02.365
♪ You're delivering my baby

58:03.134 --> 58:06.974

58:06.974 --> 58:09.311

58:09.311 --> 58:11.416

58:11.416 --> 58:13.085
(both laughing)

58:13.085 --> 58:17.426
Now, I'll be nice enough to give you the first slice.

58:17.426 --> 58:19.229
- Oh, you're so kind, girl.

58:19.229 --> 58:21.500
Thank you. - Mm-hmm.

58:21.500 --> 58:23.170
- It looks delicious.

58:23.170 --> 58:24.906
- Yes, I stayed up all night

58:25.941 --> 58:27.310
baking this cake for you.

58:27.310 --> 58:29.014
All right, now, open wide.

58:29.014 --> 58:30.817
- You know what?

58:30.817 --> 58:32.954
I'm not a child.

58:32.954 --> 58:35.392
Look, I can feed myself.

58:35.392 --> 58:37.061
I wanna celebrate with you.

58:37.061 --> 58:38.932
- No. - Yes.

58:38.932 --> 58:40.634
Come on, you can just untie me

58:40.634 --> 58:42.471
and I promise I won't run.

58:44.541 --> 58:47.046
Girl, let me enjoy the cake with you.

58:47.046 --> 58:48.014
- I don't think so.

58:49.183 --> 58:51.387
- I promise, I won't run.

58:51.387 --> 58:52.222
Trust me.

58:55.294 --> 58:58.767
It's a party, right? (laughs)

58:58.767 --> 58:59.768
- Oh.

58:59.768 --> 59:01.472
Well, yeah.

59:01.472 --> 59:03.041
It is a party. (laughs)

59:03.041 --> 59:04.244
- Okay.

59:04.244 --> 59:06.982
You try anything, that's it.

59:06.982 --> 59:08.785
That's it, that's it, that's it.

59:08.785 --> 59:09.620
- You got it.

59:11.790 --> 59:12.859
- Oh, fine.

59:15.063 --> 59:16.699
All right.

59:16.699 --> 59:17.701
All yours.

59:17.701 --> 59:18.636
- Oh.

59:18.636 --> 59:21.308
Oh my gosh.

59:21.308 --> 59:24.547
Your baby, he loves your voice.

59:25.682 --> 59:26.784
- Oh, should I sing to him again.

59:26.784 --> 59:28.587
- No, that's all right. (laughs)

59:28.587 --> 59:30.591
But he is kicking a lot.

59:30.591 --> 59:32.127
You wanna feel it?

59:32.127 --> 59:33.563
I think he's gonna be a soccer player.

59:33.563 --> 59:34.531
(Monica gasps)

59:34.531 --> 59:35.500
- My little soccer player.

59:35.500 --> 59:37.036
- Yeah.

59:37.036 --> 59:39.073
Get a little closer.

59:39.073 --> 59:40.642
You feel it?

59:40.642 --> 59:41.644
How does it feel?

59:41.644 --> 59:44.449
- Oh my god, it feels amazing.

59:44.449 --> 59:45.618
(Monica screams) (banging)

59:45.618 --> 59:47.922
- Eat cake, bitch!

59:47.922 --> 59:49.992
(Monica screaming)

59:49.992 --> 59:54.567
- Bitch! (screams)

59:54.567 --> 59:57.940
Carmen! (screams)

59:57.940 --> 1:00:00.678
(suspenseful music)

1:00:00.678 --> 1:00:01.914
Got you, bitch!

1:00:02.849 --> 1:00:05.654
(both screaming)

1:00:05.654 --> 1:00:07.390
This is my baby, bitch!

1:00:07.390 --> 1:00:08.325
- Shit!

1:00:08.325 --> 1:00:11.230
(Monica screaming)

1:00:13.001 --> 1:00:13.969
(door slamming)

1:00:13.969 --> 1:00:14.803
(lock clicking)

1:00:14.803 --> 1:00:16.273
Open up, Carmen!

1:00:16.273 --> 1:00:17.108
Now!

1:00:17.976 --> 1:00:20.848
(Carmen breathing heavily)

1:00:20.848 --> 1:00:22.350
- Shit, the power.

1:00:23.854 --> 1:00:25.456
Where's my charger?

1:00:28.194 --> 1:00:29.230
Dammit.

1:00:29.230 --> 1:00:31.668
Where the hell is my charger?

1:00:35.207 --> 1:00:37.712
(Monica breathing heavily)

1:00:37.712 --> 1:00:39.314
- Looking for this?

1:00:40.517 --> 1:00:43.221
(Carmen screams)

1:00:43.221 --> 1:00:44.924
- [Carmen] You bitch!

1:00:46.695 --> 1:00:49.366
- Don't worry, you'll be out sooner than later.

1:00:49.366 --> 1:00:54.341
I will get my baby! (groans)

1:00:57.548 --> 1:00:59.184
- [911 Operator] 911, what's your emergency?

1:00:59.184 --> 1:01:00.319
- Yes, yes, please.

1:01:00.319 --> 1:01:01.788
Please, I need help.

1:01:01.788 --> 1:01:02.790
She's trying to steal my baby, she's trying to kill me!

1:01:02.790 --> 1:01:04.860
(phone beeping)

1:01:04.860 --> 1:01:07.632
(Carmen screams)

1:01:07.632 --> 1:01:11.238
(Carmen breathing heavily)

1:01:13.242 --> 1:01:14.711
What time is it?

1:01:14.711 --> 1:01:15.613
Okay, okay.

1:01:16.548 --> 1:01:17.784
Okay, just don't move.

1:01:17.784 --> 1:01:19.220
She'll be here in a couple hours.

1:01:19.220 --> 1:01:20.055
Okay.

1:01:20.055 --> 1:01:21.123
Okay, baby.

1:01:21.123 --> 1:01:23.060
It's gonna be okay.

1:01:23.060 --> 1:01:24.662
I'm gonna get us through this.

1:01:24.662 --> 1:01:25.498
Okay.

1:01:27.267 --> 1:01:30.273
(Carmen whimpering)

1:01:37.018 --> 1:01:39.389
(Monica breathing heavily)

1:01:39.389 --> 1:01:44.398
- That's okay. (ominous music)

1:01:45.967 --> 1:01:47.738
Everything's okay.

1:01:47.738 --> 1:01:48.539
It's okay.

1:01:49.607 --> 1:01:51.010
You're gonna get your baby.

1:01:51.010 --> 1:01:53.147
You're gonna get your baby.

1:01:53.147 --> 1:01:53.949
Smile.

1:01:55.051 --> 1:01:56.152
That's right.

1:01:56.152 --> 1:01:57.522
Keep smiling.

1:01:57.522 --> 1:01:58.557
Keep smiling.

1:01:59.826 --> 1:02:00.861
That's right.

1:02:02.397 --> 1:02:04.768
I'm gonna kill this bitch.

1:02:04.768 --> 1:02:08.608
(suspenseful music continues)

1:02:18.794 --> 1:02:21.064
(smacking)

1:02:22.166 --> 1:02:23.602
- Huh.

1:02:23.602 --> 1:02:25.906
I don't see their car here, babe.

1:02:27.342 --> 1:02:29.713
- I don't either, but why wouldn't their car be here?

1:02:29.713 --> 1:02:30.948
- I don't know,

1:02:30.948 --> 1:02:32.084
they probably went to the store or something.

1:02:32.084 --> 1:02:33.519
- The store? For what?

1:02:34.655 --> 1:02:35.590
- She's pregnated.

1:02:35.590 --> 1:02:37.059
I mean, she's probably hungry.

1:02:38.195 --> 1:02:39.697
But they told you to be here at 4:30, right?

1:02:39.697 --> 1:02:41.668
Look, just go up there and knock on the door and check.

1:02:41.668 --> 1:02:42.770
- Me?

1:02:42.770 --> 1:02:44.106
No, you the man, you go up there.

1:02:44.106 --> 1:02:45.308
- I don't...

1:02:45.308 --> 1:02:46.109
That's your friend, that's not mine.

1:02:46.109 --> 1:02:46.844
That's your friend.

1:02:46.844 --> 1:02:48.380
- And?

1:02:48.380 --> 1:02:49.715
- She's pregnant, y'all need some girl time or something.

1:02:49.715 --> 1:02:50.984
Look, I'ma try to call them on the phone.

1:02:50.984 --> 1:02:51.819
You go ahead.

1:02:52.755 --> 1:02:54.190
- Man, whatever.

1:02:54.190 --> 1:02:56.495
I'ma go check on my friend. - Yeah, you do that.

1:02:56.495 --> 1:02:59.600
(Gisele laughs)

1:02:59.600 --> 1:03:02.940
(phone ringing)

1:03:02.940 --> 1:03:05.844
(car door shutting)

1:03:12.557 --> 1:03:15.562
(Carmen whimpering)

1:03:21.172 --> 1:03:22.441
- Wakey, wakey.

1:03:24.278 --> 1:03:25.113
Alrighty.

1:03:26.282 --> 1:03:28.118
It's almost time for that baby to come.

1:03:29.787 --> 1:03:30.789
You excited?

1:03:31.691 --> 1:03:33.694
- What did you do to me?

1:03:34.896 --> 1:03:36.132
- I did a lot to you.

1:03:36.132 --> 1:03:38.236
- I'm gonna kill you, bitch.

1:03:39.338 --> 1:03:40.207
- No, you're not.

1:03:41.376 --> 1:03:43.245
You're gonna lay here while I open you up.

1:03:43.245 --> 1:03:45.182
What do they call that?

1:03:45.182 --> 1:03:46.017
A C-section.

1:03:46.017 --> 1:03:47.252
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:03:47.252 --> 1:03:49.990
Don't worry, I watched a ton of YouTube videos.

1:03:49.990 --> 1:03:51.627
I got this down pat.

1:03:51.627 --> 1:03:53.263
Here.

1:03:53.263 --> 1:03:54.098
(Carmen screaming)

1:03:54.098 --> 1:03:55.834
Hey, hey, hey.

1:03:55.834 --> 1:03:56.669
Shut up!

1:03:58.339 --> 1:03:59.975
- Go to hell!

1:03:59.975 --> 1:04:01.244
Let go of me!

1:04:01.244 --> 1:04:04.917
(knocking at door) (ominous music)

1:04:04.917 --> 1:04:06.587
- Are you expecting someone?

1:04:06.587 --> 1:04:10.127
(knocking at door)

1:04:10.127 --> 1:04:12.330
You think I'm playing with you.

1:04:12.330 --> 1:04:14.301
- Find out for yourself, bitch.

1:04:18.843 --> 1:04:19.677
Help me!

1:04:21.414 --> 1:04:22.850
Somebody help me!

1:04:25.254 --> 1:04:26.523
Gisele!

1:04:26.523 --> 1:04:27.357
Phillip!

1:04:29.762 --> 1:04:32.100
You gotta be quicker than that, bitch.

1:04:32.100 --> 1:04:32.935
Help me!

1:04:35.339 --> 1:04:38.177
(Monica laughing)

1:04:41.216 --> 1:04:43.620
- Shut it up. (Carmen screaming)

1:04:43.620 --> 1:04:44.789
Shut up.

1:04:44.789 --> 1:04:49.798
Don't move. (Carmen screaming)

1:04:54.206 --> 1:04:55.041
- Okay.

1:04:56.377 --> 1:05:01.018
Is there cake in my hair? (Carmen screaming)

1:05:02.020 --> 1:05:04.191
Okay. (Carmen screaming)

1:05:04.191 --> 1:05:06.428
(knocking)

1:05:14.276 --> 1:05:15.745
Can I help you?

1:05:15.745 --> 1:05:19.418
- Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm here to support my sister

1:05:19.418 --> 1:05:21.556
with her natural birth.

1:05:21.556 --> 1:05:23.893
- [Monica] (gasps) Oh!

1:05:23.893 --> 1:05:25.329
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:05:25.329 --> 1:05:27.265
Come on in, come on in.

1:05:40.957 --> 1:05:42.627
- So who are you?

1:05:42.627 --> 1:05:43.829
- I'm Monica Harris.

1:05:43.829 --> 1:05:45.432
I'm the midwife.

1:05:45.432 --> 1:05:48.036
- Oh yeah, Carmen told me you were coming over.

1:05:49.806 --> 1:05:51.710
- Damn signal, man.

1:05:51.710 --> 1:05:54.147
This that bullshit got us out here in the woods.

1:05:58.588 --> 1:06:01.261
(phone ringing)

1:06:04.332 --> 1:06:05.568
- [James] Hey, this is James.

1:06:05.568 --> 1:06:06.670
Sorry I couldn't get to the phone-

1:06:06.670 --> 1:06:07.505
- Man.

1:06:08.907 --> 1:06:10.377
(phone ringing)

1:06:10.377 --> 1:06:12.814
(James' phone ringing) Need to stop playing, man.

1:06:12.814 --> 1:06:17.022
(birds chirping) (suspenseful music)

1:06:17.022 --> 1:06:20.261
(James' phone ringing)

1:06:22.398 --> 1:06:23.366
- Where is Carmen and James,

1:06:23.366 --> 1:06:24.969
because I didn't see James' car-

1:06:24.969 --> 1:06:27.040
- Actually, James just left not too long ago.

1:06:27.040 --> 1:06:29.144
He went to get Carmen some ice cream.

1:06:29.144 --> 1:06:30.146
- Oh, he did?

1:06:31.047 --> 1:06:32.817
Well, what kind did he get her?

1:06:32.817 --> 1:06:34.119
'Cause I hope he got her butter pecan.

1:06:34.119 --> 1:06:36.724
That's her favorite ice cream.

1:06:36.724 --> 1:06:39.829
- You know, Carmen could not stop talking

1:06:39.829 --> 1:06:42.300
about butter pecan ice cream.

1:06:42.300 --> 1:06:43.569
He left not too long ago.

1:06:43.569 --> 1:06:46.342
He should be coming back any minute now.

1:06:52.553 --> 1:06:53.387
- What's going on?

1:06:53.387 --> 1:06:54.322
You all right?

1:06:54.322 --> 1:06:55.257
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:06:55.257 --> 1:06:56.192
I got you, J, I got you, J.

1:06:56.192 --> 1:06:57.762
Come on, come on, man.

1:06:57.762 --> 1:06:59.765
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

1:06:59.765 --> 1:07:02.036
Hey, man, what the hell happened to you, dawg?

1:07:03.338 --> 1:07:04.741
- I was about to ask you the same thing.

1:07:04.741 --> 1:07:06.176
- Shit, you tell me, man.

1:07:06.176 --> 1:07:08.180
We came up here to support your birth.

1:07:08.180 --> 1:07:10.852
And then you aren't answering the door,

1:07:10.852 --> 1:07:12.087
your phone going straight to voicemail.

1:07:12.087 --> 1:07:14.158
I turn around, you in the woods and shit.

1:07:14.158 --> 1:07:15.460
What's going on, man?

1:07:15.460 --> 1:07:17.564
- (groans) All I remember is

1:07:19.534 --> 1:07:22.272
I went to the store to get Carmen some ice cream.

1:07:24.810 --> 1:07:26.580
I pulled over for a hitchhiker and-

1:07:26.580 --> 1:07:28.150
- What?

1:07:28.150 --> 1:07:28.985
- Ended up being

1:07:31.021 --> 1:07:31.956
Monica ass.

1:07:33.058 --> 1:07:34.895
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:07:34.895 --> 1:07:36.097
Monica?

1:07:36.097 --> 1:07:38.101
Crazy-ass Monica?

1:07:38.101 --> 1:07:40.005
Man, I told you to leave her silly ass alone, dawg.

1:07:40.005 --> 1:07:41.173
You hard-headed, man.

1:07:42.709 --> 1:07:45.815
- All I remember was she was talking,

1:07:45.815 --> 1:07:49.888
and crying, and she knocked my ass out with something.

1:07:53.228 --> 1:07:54.664
Woke up in the middle of the woods

1:07:54.664 --> 1:07:57.435
and now I'm talking to you.

1:07:57.435 --> 1:07:59.573
- You getting knocked out by women now, too?

1:07:59.573 --> 1:08:00.842
- Man, now's not the time.

1:08:00.842 --> 1:08:03.046
- Man, shut your ass up, man.

1:08:03.046 --> 1:08:03.848
Shit, stay there.

1:08:03.848 --> 1:08:04.682
I'ma get some help.

1:08:06.686 --> 1:08:07.487
Wait a minute.

1:08:09.424 --> 1:08:11.828
I think Monica in the house with them right now.

1:08:14.166 --> 1:08:15.101
Oh, shit.

1:08:15.101 --> 1:08:16.035
No, no, wait, wait, wait, J.

1:08:16.035 --> 1:08:17.204
I got this one, all right?

1:08:17.204 --> 1:08:18.673
Look, relax, man.

1:08:18.673 --> 1:08:21.111
I gotta go get my wife, Carmen, and my godson, man.

1:08:21.111 --> 1:08:22.347
- Be careful, man.

1:08:22.347 --> 1:08:23.182
- Oh, don't worry about me.

1:08:23.182 --> 1:08:24.417
I got that today.

1:08:24.417 --> 1:08:25.653
She picked the wrong one.

1:08:33.400 --> 1:08:36.406
(Carmen whimpering)

1:08:39.378 --> 1:08:42.951
(Carmen screaming)

1:08:42.951 --> 1:08:43.886
- Where's Carmen?

1:08:45.923 --> 1:08:46.925
- Upstairs sleeping.

1:08:48.260 --> 1:08:51.132
I have to finish preparing for this birth.

1:08:51.132 --> 1:08:52.134
Where are you going?

1:08:55.240 --> 1:08:59.414
- If you don't mind, I'm just gonna go check on my girl.

1:08:59.414 --> 1:09:00.816
- She's fine.

1:09:00.816 --> 1:09:02.753
She's sleeping.

1:09:02.753 --> 1:09:04.022
(punching) (Monica groans)

1:09:04.022 --> 1:09:05.592
- Carmen!

1:09:05.592 --> 1:09:07.094
Carmen! (Monica screams)

1:09:07.094 --> 1:09:08.496
- [Monica] Bitch!

1:09:15.543 --> 1:09:16.378
(pistol cocking)

1:09:16.378 --> 1:09:18.481
(Carmen screaming)

1:09:18.481 --> 1:09:21.119
(Gisele screams)

1:09:21.119 --> 1:09:22.556
- My god, what the?

1:09:22.556 --> 1:09:25.227
(intense music)

1:09:26.630 --> 1:09:29.401
- That bitch is crazy! - What did she do to you?

1:09:29.401 --> 1:09:30.236
- Get me the fuck out of here!

1:09:30.236 --> 1:09:31.305
- Okay, okay!

1:09:32.574 --> 1:09:35.345
My god, what the hell did she do?

1:09:46.031 --> 1:09:48.702
(intense music)

1:09:49.971 --> 1:09:50.806
- Gisele?

1:09:52.475 --> 1:09:53.678
Carmen?

1:09:53.678 --> 1:09:58.687
(Phillip groans) (glass shatters)

1:10:00.290 --> 1:10:02.828
- Where's James? Where's Phillip?

1:10:02.828 --> 1:10:03.662
- I don't know.

1:10:03.662 --> 1:10:04.497
Outside.

1:10:04.497 --> 1:10:06.635
We all looking for you.

1:10:06.635 --> 1:10:07.837
Let me help you.

1:10:07.837 --> 1:10:08.772
Okay, okay.

1:10:08.772 --> 1:10:10.775
Come on, I got you, girl.

1:10:14.248 --> 1:10:15.651
(scissors stabbing) (Gisele groans)

1:10:15.651 --> 1:10:17.555
- Gisele! (Gisele breathing heavily)

1:10:17.555 --> 1:10:21.662
- That'll teach you to keep your hands to yourself.

1:10:21.662 --> 1:10:24.366
(Gisele groans)

1:10:24.366 --> 1:10:25.802
(Monica groans)

1:10:25.802 --> 1:10:27.472
- Look what you made me do!

1:10:27.472 --> 1:10:28.507
Fuck you!

1:10:28.507 --> 1:10:30.411
This is all your fault!

1:10:31.780 --> 1:10:33.583
I just want my baby.

1:10:33.583 --> 1:10:36.154
- It's my baby, bitch! - Give it to me!

1:10:36.154 --> 1:10:36.989
- Fuck you!

1:10:36.989 --> 1:10:39.026
(Monica groans)

1:10:39.026 --> 1:10:42.633
(Carmen whimpering)

1:10:42.633 --> 1:10:44.669
- This is my baby, bitch!

1:10:47.040 --> 1:10:47.876
(door bashing)

1:10:47.876 --> 1:10:48.710
(screaming)

1:10:48.710 --> 1:10:49.812
- Monica, Monica.

1:10:49.812 --> 1:10:51.248
Monica, Monica, Monica.

1:10:51.248 --> 1:10:53.118
- James. - Stop.

1:10:53.118 --> 1:10:54.854
(Carmen whimpering)

1:10:54.854 --> 1:10:56.056
- I gotta get rid of this bitch!

1:10:56.056 --> 1:10:57.359
- No, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1:10:57.359 --> 1:10:58.996
Hold on, Monica, wait, wait.

1:11:00.064 --> 1:11:01.867
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

1:11:03.170 --> 1:11:04.105
I'm sorry.

1:11:04.105 --> 1:11:05.340
- No you're not. - Yes I am.

1:11:05.340 --> 1:11:06.910
- No you're not. - Yes I am.

1:11:06.910 --> 1:11:08.245
We can fix this.

1:11:08.245 --> 1:11:09.080
We can fix this.

1:11:09.080 --> 1:11:09.915
Let me fix it.

1:11:09.915 --> 1:11:11.050
- We can fix it? - Yes.

1:11:11.050 --> 1:11:12.821
Okay? - Monica, no.

1:11:12.821 --> 1:11:13.823
- I love you.

1:11:13.823 --> 1:11:17.261
I love you. (soft music)

1:11:17.261 --> 1:11:19.432
Yeah, I love you.

1:11:19.432 --> 1:11:21.736
- You love me? - Yes.

1:11:21.736 --> 1:11:22.939
Yeah.

1:11:27.346 --> 1:11:29.217
I love you. - Yeah?

1:11:29.217 --> 1:11:30.052
(Carmen whimpering)

1:11:30.052 --> 1:11:31.588
Yeah.

1:11:31.588 --> 1:11:33.023
- Put the scissors down- - I told you.

1:11:33.023 --> 1:11:34.226
- [James] Come on, Monica.

1:11:34.226 --> 1:11:35.595
Put the scissors down.

1:11:35.595 --> 1:11:37.397
- We can fix it. - Yeah.

1:11:37.397 --> 1:11:39.301
- We can fix it.

1:11:39.301 --> 1:11:43.108
(banging) (Monica groans)

1:11:43.108 --> 1:11:44.611
- James, the baby!

1:11:46.781 --> 1:11:50.054
(soft music continues)

1:12:09.989 --> 1:12:12.929
(gravel crunching)

1:12:17.102 --> 1:12:18.371
- Howdy, folks.

1:12:18.371 --> 1:12:20.475
I'm Sheriff Kirby Tubbs.

1:12:20.475 --> 1:12:21.911
Let me first say,

1:12:21.911 --> 1:12:25.151
I'm so sorry for all you good folks have gone through.

1:12:25.151 --> 1:12:26.753
This kind of thing just doesn't happen

1:12:26.753 --> 1:12:28.656
in our neck of the woods.

1:12:28.656 --> 1:12:30.493
But I can guarantee you this:

1:12:30.493 --> 1:12:32.597
It will not happen again.

1:12:32.597 --> 1:12:35.336
She's going away for a long, long time.

1:12:36.471 --> 1:12:40.812
Now, I see you guys got a new bundle of joy,

1:12:40.812 --> 1:12:43.383
and I wanna say congratulations.

1:12:43.383 --> 1:12:45.654
If you need anything, anything at all,

1:12:45.654 --> 1:12:47.791
you make sure you let me know.

1:12:47.791 --> 1:12:49.594
- Thank you, man. - Yes, sir.

1:12:49.594 --> 1:12:51.732
Madam. - Thank you, Sheriff.

1:12:51.732 --> 1:12:52.967
- [Kirby] Okay.

1:12:58.543 --> 1:13:01.282
(birds chirping)

1:13:06.625 --> 1:13:08.428
- [Carmen] Babe, I can't believe your parents

1:13:08.428 --> 1:13:10.232
allowed us to keep the cabin.

1:13:10.232 --> 1:13:11.901
- Yeah, well, they walked in

1:13:11.901 --> 1:13:14.906
and seen this place nearly destroyed,

1:13:14.906 --> 1:13:18.012
decided to gift it to us for our son.

1:13:18.012 --> 1:13:20.150
- (scoffs) Well damn, you got lucky.

1:13:20.150 --> 1:13:22.654
I'll tell you what, this is lit.

1:13:22.654 --> 1:13:23.588
- Okay, whatever.

1:13:23.588 --> 1:13:25.092
Let me finish telling my story.

1:13:25.092 --> 1:13:26.661
So y'all know I had her right where I wanted her.

1:13:26.661 --> 1:13:27.897
I was bobbing and weaving and everything.

1:13:27.897 --> 1:13:30.034
And then she gon' hit me with that cheap shot.

1:13:30.034 --> 1:13:31.202
- [Phillip] She couldn't handle you straight up, babe.

1:13:31.202 --> 1:13:32.705
- [Gisele] I know.

1:13:32.705 --> 1:13:33.941
- So I tried to come in, she tried to hit me with the bat.

1:13:33.941 --> 1:13:35.777
You know, I ducked, you know what I'm saying?

1:13:35.777 --> 1:13:37.648
I didn't wanna shoot her 'cause she a female.

1:13:37.648 --> 1:13:38.883
- Mm-hmm. - Right?

1:13:38.883 --> 1:13:40.286
- So I squared up, two-pieced her,

1:13:40.286 --> 1:13:41.822
hit her with the Mike Tyson uppercut.

1:13:41.822 --> 1:13:42.757
She fell.

1:13:42.757 --> 1:13:43.992
Then I gotta be the hero,

1:13:43.992 --> 1:13:45.228
so I turn around, try to run upstairs,

1:13:45.228 --> 1:13:46.664
and I trip and fall. - I know.

1:13:46.664 --> 1:13:48.935
- My head hit the corner of the table.

1:13:48.935 --> 1:13:50.337
Next thing you know, I'm out.

1:13:50.337 --> 1:13:51.171
You know what I'm saying?

1:13:51.171 --> 1:13:52.508
That's how that went.

1:13:52.508 --> 1:13:53.742
- I know, baby. - So that's how it happened?

1:13:53.742 --> 1:13:54.411
- Really, that's how it went down?

1:13:54.411 --> 1:13:55.346
- Come on, man.

1:13:55.346 --> 1:13:56.648
You know I ain't gon' lose.

1:13:56.648 --> 1:13:57.851
I ain't gon'-

1:13:57.851 --> 1:13:59.487
- (sighs) Y'all, I'm just glad it's all over.

1:13:59.487 --> 1:14:01.324
- Yeah, me too.

1:14:02.325 --> 1:14:04.329
- It was all your fault, James,

1:14:04.329 --> 1:14:06.633
trying to be all slick and shit.

1:14:06.633 --> 1:14:08.569
