NARRATOR (OFFSCREEN): Previously
on "Dance Academy."

00:04.839 --> 00:06.080
-What's stopping me from
finishing second year by the

00:06.120 --> 00:07.639
end of the semester and
transferring straight into

00:07.679 --> 00:09.039
third year?

00:09.080 --> 00:10.679
-There's catastrophic messed
up, and then there's you.

00:10.720 --> 00:12.800
-You think it was
your hand cream?

00:12.839 --> 00:15.240
-What happened?

00:15.279 --> 00:17.600
There was no one
like your mom.

00:17.640 --> 00:19.600
-Dad said she was depressed.

00:19.640 --> 00:22.559
I remember her lying in bed.

00:22.600 --> 00:24.320
-Maybe the reason Sammy
went out with

00:24.359 --> 00:25.320
both of us is because--

00:25.359 --> 00:26.600
-We're similar?

00:26.640 --> 00:28.280
-You know who's a show
reel expert?

00:28.320 --> 00:29.600
Ethan.

00:29.640 --> 00:31.320
We could do a conference call.

00:31.359 --> 00:34.320
Don't think I haven't noticed
the weird cone of silence

00:34.359 --> 00:35.799
surrounding your Barcelonian
summer.

00:35.840 --> 00:38.759
-I had a gorgeous guy with a
heart the size of Sydney

00:38.799 --> 00:41.560
Harbor who I absolutely didn't
deserve, and I stepped it up.

00:44.520 --> 00:46.479
[theme music]

01:34.480 --> 01:37.200
-[speaking spanish]

01:37.239 --> 01:38.599
Ah, sorry.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.760
Um, Higson Road, National
Academy of Dance.

01:40.799 --> 01:42.120
Cheers, mate.

01:50.840 --> 01:52.439
-I rarely get time
to clear this.

01:52.480 --> 01:53.640
If it's important, text.

01:57.280 --> 01:59.400
ABIGAIL (OFFSCREEN): The motto
for the National Academy may

01:59.439 --> 02:02.599
as well be, fake it
till you make it.

02:02.640 --> 02:06.599
-You should see all the first
years camping out waiting for

02:06.640 --> 02:08.639
a celebrity citing.

02:08.680 --> 02:10.560
ABIGAIL (OFFSCREEN): Kat thinks
if she fakes being a

02:10.598 --> 02:12.199
ballet bot, she can make
up for years of

02:12.240 --> 02:14.159
throwing away her talent.

02:14.199 --> 02:15.360
-I'm just hoping everyone's
going to be so

02:15.400 --> 02:16.479
distracted, and kapow!

02:16.520 --> 02:18.800
I blitz them.

02:18.840 --> 02:20.479
ABIGAIL (OFFSCREEN): Grace
thinks if she fakes being a

02:20.520 --> 02:23.039
normal human being, no one will
notice that she has more

02:23.080 --> 02:25.159
in common with a black
widow spider.

02:25.199 --> 02:26.599
-Celebratory breakfast treats!

02:26.639 --> 02:27.800
-Oh!

02:38.599 --> 02:39.719
-Make way for Mercutio.

02:39.759 --> 02:41.159
-I've got it.

02:41.199 --> 02:42.360
I went after a company--

02:42.400 --> 02:43.120
-I know.

02:43.159 --> 02:43.800
-I'm Romeo and you're--

02:43.840 --> 02:45.240
-Lady Capulet, uh-huh!

02:45.280 --> 02:47.120
ABIGAIL (OFFSCREEN): Tara thinks
if she fakes being the

02:47.159 --> 02:49.840
perfect girlfriend, this time
she'll magically stop being

02:49.879 --> 02:54.039
neurotic, jealous, and generally
hard to please.

02:54.080 --> 02:56.199
I'm really the only person here
who's consistently honest

02:56.240 --> 02:57.360
with myself.

02:57.400 --> 02:59.599
-Benvolio, a minor role.

02:59.639 --> 03:01.719
Oh, boy!

03:01.759 --> 03:03.319
-Apparently cross-dressing
is very now.

03:03.360 --> 03:05.599
I get to play a nurse.

03:05.639 --> 03:07.639
-Is that a compliant?

03:07.680 --> 03:09.800
-Not at all, sir.

03:09.840 --> 03:11.439
-We're not only doing
Romeo and Juliet.

03:11.479 --> 03:13.759
The contemporary piece will
need a soloist, brilliant

03:13.800 --> 03:15.039
emerging choreographer.

03:15.080 --> 03:16.280
You could be just his type.

03:19.120 --> 03:21.800
-I've always had this sense
I'd play Juliet.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.759
Did Mom dance here in
the company, or--

03:23.800 --> 03:27.599
-Mm-hm, third year as well.

03:27.639 --> 03:33.120
Grace, how would you feel about
not going on tour, maybe

03:33.159 --> 03:34.599
moving in with me for
a couple of months?

03:34.639 --> 03:37.120
-Why would I want to do that?

03:37.159 --> 03:39.319
-You've been fragile.

03:39.360 --> 03:42.159
And I think some stability could
be really great for you.

03:42.199 --> 03:44.479
-I have? when?

03:44.520 --> 03:47.639
Like I would sabotage a company
performance, Lucy.

03:47.680 --> 03:50.599
-Yes, I know that you
culpability in that incident

03:50.639 --> 03:52.479
is unproven.

03:52.520 --> 03:54.159
But Grace, I'm really
worried about you.

03:54.199 --> 03:57.479
-Well, presumably I'm the best
dancer for the part.

03:57.520 --> 04:00.439
And that's why Zach cast me.

04:00.479 --> 04:01.719
-Yes, you are.

04:01.759 --> 04:04.360
-Well, it's kind of not in
your job description to

04:04.400 --> 04:07.039
undermine the production,
not to mention my

04:07.080 --> 04:08.479
entire ballet future.

04:08.520 --> 04:11.080
-As your godmother, I have other
factors to consider.

04:11.120 --> 04:14.400
-Lucy, it's the first
day of rehearsal.

04:14.439 --> 04:17.319
By the end of the week, you'll
be convinced not only that I

04:17.360 --> 04:23.079
am fine, but that this tour
needs me desperately.

04:23.120 --> 04:24.319
OK?

04:30.519 --> 04:31.839
[music playing]

04:34.680 --> 04:36.519
-You two are in almost every
scene, all right?

04:36.560 --> 04:39.240
It's your responsibility to
put in the extra hours.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.480
-You had it all figured out.

04:43.519 --> 04:46.759
Ben was Romeo, you were Juliet,
triumphing at the

04:46.800 --> 04:49.160
Wugga Wugga Arts Center.

04:49.199 --> 04:50.800
And now--?

04:50.839 --> 04:52.199
-It's a brand new
relationship.

04:52.240 --> 04:53.800
I'm not allowing
negativity in.

05:00.120 --> 05:01.759
-Once more from the lift.

05:01.800 --> 05:03.319
-So that's the plan?

05:03.360 --> 05:04.720
Be selflessly supportive?

05:04.759 --> 05:06.079
-Happy is happy.

05:08.199 --> 05:09.759
Just keep digging those
holes for yourself.

05:19.680 --> 05:22.800
-Third years, I want to
introduce Wes Cooper.

05:22.839 --> 05:25.040
Not only is he part of the
brat pack of apprentice

05:25.079 --> 05:27.800
choreographers in Europe, he's
traded a Spanish summer

05:27.839 --> 05:30.720
working with Impresion to create
a world premiere piece

05:30.759 --> 05:31.680
for your tour.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.199
-That's not such a
big trade off.

05:33.240 --> 05:35.480
I've always wanted to see the
motels of regional Australia.

05:35.519 --> 05:36.120
-Impresion?

05:36.160 --> 05:38.079
You must know Ethan.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.800
-Ah, he would be my housemate.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.199
Hi, Abby.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.240
Good surprise?

05:55.480 --> 05:57.199
-How do you want to
do this, Wes?

05:57.240 --> 05:59.319
-I guess I'll watch some of your
rehearsals and choose my

05:59.360 --> 06:01.600
soloist from there.

06:01.639 --> 06:02.800
-Sure.

06:04.800 --> 06:07.199
-Anything you want to share?

06:07.240 --> 06:09.600
-If you're applying for the role
of sassy gay best friend,

06:09.639 --> 06:10.439
I'm not recruiting.

06:10.480 --> 06:11.439
-I can't today.

06:11.480 --> 06:12.720
Tara's taking me bowling.

06:12.759 --> 06:14.439
-Did you not hear Zach?

06:14.480 --> 06:17.240
His early rehearsal period is
about complete immersion.

06:17.279 --> 06:18.560
-I don't mind postponing.

06:18.600 --> 06:21.279
-No, but it's our dating for
two weeks bowliversary.

06:21.319 --> 06:23.279
Can you believe she's
never been?

06:23.319 --> 06:24.399
-I can wait until tomorrow.

06:24.439 --> 06:25.560
Grace is right.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.160
It's more important that
you guys get the

06:27.199 --> 06:28.360
balcony scene down.

06:31.439 --> 06:33.360
-He's here.

06:33.399 --> 06:37.120
Rhys O'Leary, he's really,
really here.

06:37.160 --> 06:38.319
Rhys, hey!

06:38.360 --> 06:42.199
Can you sign my, uh, chest
for my girlfriend?

06:42.240 --> 06:43.399
-Of course.

06:46.560 --> 06:49.199
-Is that the guy from those
cheesy fantasy films?

06:49.240 --> 06:52.800
-Actually, "The Argonauts."
Uh, yes, maybe.

06:52.839 --> 06:53.920
-Hey!

06:53.959 --> 06:56.040
I was wondering if I'd
run into you guys.

06:56.079 --> 06:59.279
What are you too good for my
classes these days, hey?

06:59.319 --> 07:01.240
I've never choreographed
him before, so it'll be

07:01.279 --> 07:02.040
interesting.

07:02.079 --> 07:03.800
-Can I guess the storyline?

07:03.839 --> 07:06.040
Bad boy from wrong side of the
tracks meets ballet princess?

07:06.079 --> 07:07.399
-What else.

07:07.439 --> 07:09.720
Hey, you know, you guys
should audition.

07:09.759 --> 07:11.240
Because they're shooting lots
of the scenes here.

07:11.279 --> 07:12.600
-Well, we'd love to.

07:12.639 --> 07:15.319
But it'll probably clash with
tour commitments, so.

07:15.360 --> 07:16.120
-Would it?

07:16.160 --> 07:17.480
-Mm-hm.

07:17.519 --> 07:18.600
-Well, if you change your mind,
the director's got me

07:18.639 --> 07:19.800
seeing dances for the
minor roles today.

07:24.680 --> 07:27.279
-She's so needy, especially
now Marcus is

07:27.319 --> 07:28.680
going back to Texas.

07:28.720 --> 07:30.480
I mean, I get she's going
to miss her fiance.

07:30.519 --> 07:33.040
But I'm not going to stay home
from tour and walk the cat.

07:33.079 --> 07:35.399
-I think it's feeling a bit
off, our connection.

07:35.439 --> 07:37.439
-Well, we should practice
the kiss.

07:37.480 --> 07:40.199
Pucker up?

07:40.240 --> 07:42.759
-Why don't we visualize we're
dancing with someone we're

07:42.800 --> 07:44.040
really into?

07:44.079 --> 07:45.800
-So while you're dancing
with me, you're

07:45.839 --> 07:48.240
fantasizing about Tara?

07:48.279 --> 07:49.480
Awesome!

07:52.680 --> 07:54.720
-Wow, there are a lot of you.

07:54.759 --> 07:56.680
I apologize in advance
if things get brutal.

07:56.720 --> 07:58.319
-Exams are looming.

07:58.360 --> 08:02.360
You need to test yourself in
a competitive environment.

08:02.399 --> 08:04.680
-I'm sensing this is less about
me fast tracking and

08:04.720 --> 08:07.199
about you needing a hand held.

08:07.240 --> 08:10.279
Is Benvolio really
that bad a role?

08:10.319 --> 08:11.600
-Unimaginable.

08:11.639 --> 08:13.199
[music playing]

08:58.240 --> 09:00.399
-Jazz fingers in your
eyes, girls!

09:00.440 --> 09:02.320
We're gonna own that ballet
round tomorrow!

09:05.080 --> 09:06.840
-Can I beg you for dinner?

09:06.879 --> 09:09.080
Ethan promised tapas that
would beat La Boqueria.

09:09.120 --> 09:10.440
-Oh!

09:10.480 --> 09:12.480
News feed, you're the flat mate
who keeps leading his

09:12.519 --> 09:13.360
astray.

09:13.399 --> 09:14.840
-And you're Kat,
the hot sister.

09:14.879 --> 09:16.399
-Oh, oh, so you would know!

09:16.440 --> 09:17.679
What happened over there?

09:17.720 --> 09:20.039
Because I can't get anything
out of either party.

09:20.080 --> 09:22.399
Were they gruesomely loved up?

09:22.440 --> 09:24.360
-Loved up between
Abby and Ethan.

09:24.399 --> 09:25.600
Whoa!

09:25.639 --> 09:27.240
She never calls, she never
writes, and now I'm

09:27.279 --> 09:28.600
unmentionable?

09:28.639 --> 09:30.639
Well, you do know how to make
a guy feel like a cheap

09:30.679 --> 09:31.840
holiday fling.

09:31.879 --> 09:35.639
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait,
wait, the two of you?

09:35.679 --> 09:37.120
-You were right about you
turn out, by the way.

09:37.159 --> 09:39.600
We're going to have to work on
that when you're my soloist.

09:39.639 --> 09:43.840
-I'll dance your solo the day
you river dance naked singing

09:43.879 --> 09:47.639
"She'll be Coming 'Round the
Mountain" in Spanish.

09:47.679 --> 09:49.720
-We both know that would
stop traffic.

09:49.759 --> 09:51.080
See ya.

09:59.360 --> 10:00.639
[music playing]

10:15.240 --> 10:17.519
-I never thought I'd say,
you're trying too hard.

10:17.559 --> 10:20.039
Early days, don't force it.

10:20.080 --> 10:22.120
Tara, I want you
learning this.

10:22.159 --> 10:23.399
-I'm sorry?

10:23.440 --> 10:24.360
Yeah, sorry?

10:24.399 --> 10:25.759
-You're understudying Juliet.

10:25.799 --> 10:28.320
-Zach, I'm not someone
who gets injured.

10:28.360 --> 10:29.279
-It's a long tour.

10:29.320 --> 10:30.360
You need to be covered.

10:30.399 --> 10:32.159
-Ah, Zach, who's understudying
Romeo?

10:47.159 --> 10:49.480
-Hey, man, it's awesome you're
doing the research.

10:49.519 --> 10:50.519
A lot of people get their
posture wrong.

10:50.559 --> 10:52.440
So give everyone a basic
character and--

10:52.480 --> 10:54.279
-Thanks.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.639
-Ben, that's your cue, mate.

10:57.679 --> 10:58.639
-Sorry.

10:58.679 --> 11:00.360
We did promise we'd
be unobtrusive.

11:00.399 --> 11:01.600
-It's fine.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.519
-You should be encouraging him
to take this seriously, not

11:10.559 --> 11:12.240
dragging him off bowling.

11:12.279 --> 11:14.480
-You think it's my idea
to go bowling?

11:14.519 --> 11:15.679
That's Ben's dream date.

11:24.879 --> 11:27.519
-Abigail, why aren't
you in rehearsal?

11:27.559 --> 11:30.320
-You mean for a tour that's
essentially a prolonged

11:30.360 --> 11:33.080
showcase to get into a company
that's already ruled me out?

11:33.120 --> 11:35.480
Yeah, I decided the movie was
a better use of my time.

11:35.519 --> 11:36.679
-Abigail!

11:36.720 --> 11:38.600
-Um, I'm not going on tour.

11:38.639 --> 11:39.639
Do you mind if I--

11:39.679 --> 11:41.039
-Off you go, Katrina.

11:46.120 --> 11:47.480
-What do you smell?

11:47.519 --> 11:49.279
-Mm, sweat and tear?

11:49.320 --> 11:53.200
-Ah, I smell the best
girlfriend ever!

11:53.240 --> 11:54.080
-Hey!
