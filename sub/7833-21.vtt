13:26.872 --> 13:28.806
Wow. Tough glass.

13:28.908 --> 13:32.344
- [ Camera Shutter Clicks ]
- I still say ours is bigger.

13:32.444 --> 13:35.936
[ Screaming ]

13:36.048 --> 13:38.039
Our speed bumps are stronger too.

13:38.150 --> 13:41.813
I don't know, Simpson. How do I know
you didn't cut your own brakes?

13:41.921 --> 13:44.617
- Why would I do that?.
- I don't know.

13:44.723 --> 13:46.918
Get some attention from
a handsome police officer.

13:47.026 --> 13:49.317
- That's crazy!
- [ Sighs ]

13:49.628 --> 13:53.928
Look, I know I don't have any proof.
But this woman is trying to kill me!

13:54.033 --> 13:57.833
Fine. Let me tell you what I tell everybody
who comes in here.

13:57.937 --> 13:59.802
The law is powerless to help you.

13:59.905 --> 14:02.703
Do I have to be dead
before you’ll help me?.

14:02.808 --> 14:04.867
Well, not dead. Dying.

14:04.977 --> 14:07.207
No, no, no, no. Don't walk away.
How 'bout this?.

14:07.313 --> 14:10.077
Just show me the knife,
in your back, not too deep...

14:10.182 --> 14:12.412
but it should be able
to stand by itself.

14:14.086 --> 14:15.917
Come on, Becky.
Tell us your big news.

14:16.021 --> 14:18.421
Well, I wanted to wait
for your mother, but okay.

14:18.524 --> 14:22.119
- I found an apartment and I'm moving out.
- Oh, no.

14:22.228 --> 14:25.664
Becky, I think I speak
for all of us when I say...

14:25.764 --> 14:28.562
when's the ice cream
gonna get here?.

14:28.667 --> 14:33.263
- [Thunderclap ]
- And God said, Gatherye two of every flavor.

14:33.372 --> 14:37.900
Anoint them with 62 sauces,
whipped cream and nuts.

14:38.010 --> 14:42.106
And ye shall call it...
the Ark!

[ Gasps, Panting ]

14:47.052 --> 14:50.180
- Homer!
- Relax. He's gorging.

14:50.289 --> 14:52.120
Okay, maybe not.

14:53.292 --> 14:56.159
We gotta save him!

Don't mess with me!
I've got jimmies!

- I can only see a horrible rainbow!

15:14.513 --> 15:17.482
- [ Gasps ]
- Shut up, Becky!

15:17.583 --> 15:21.451
- There, I finally said it. [ Grunts ]

- [ Wiggum ] Drop the cone, sugar!
- [ Gunshot]

15:30.596 --> 15:33.793
- Whoa. Whoopsie.
- Take her away, boys.

15:35.134 --> 15:38.103
[ Groans ]
I thought you said the law was powerless.

15:38.203 --> 15:40.501
Yeah, powerless to help you,
not punish you.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.403
Mmm. Earned my treat.

15:42.508 --> 15:45.534
This isn't over, Becky!
I know where you live!

15:45.644 --> 15:47.771
My house!

15:53.585 --> 15:55.849
Poor Maggie.
How many insanity hearings...

15:55.955 --> 15:58.423
have you been to
in your short little life?.

15:58.524 --> 16:00.424
Mrs. Simpson, before we begin...

16:00.526 --> 16:04.428
- I just want to assure you that this is not a trial.
- [ Both Moan ]

16:04.530 --> 16:06.760
- All right. It's a trial.
- [ Both ] Yes!

16:06.865 --> 16:11.962
Now, Marge, according to this, you recently
went berserk in an ice-cream parlor.

16:12.071 --> 16:14.335
- Yes.
- And, Marge...

16:14.440 --> 16:18.342
did you ever have an unhealthy fixation
on Ringo Starr?.

16:18.444 --> 16:20.537
It was healthy.
He reciprocated.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.046
He reciprocated!

16:23.148 --> 16:25.116
Mmm, please.

16:25.217 --> 16:27.947
Road rage?. Excuse me.
What are you doing?.

16:28.053 --> 16:32.353
Oh. I was just praying to God
that you’ll find me sane.

16:32.458 --> 16:37.054
I see. And this "god,"
is he in this room right now?.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.528
Oh, yes.
He's kind of everywhere.

16:39.631 --> 16:41.531
- Mmm.
- Mm-mmm.

16:41.633 --> 16:45.330
Marge Simpson, you give us no choice
but to declare you utterly-

16:45.437 --> 16:47.337
I'm not insane!

16:47.439 --> 16:49.964
You didn't let me finish.
Insane!

16:54.113 --> 16:57.173

17:00.019 --> 17:03.182
[ Shouts ]
I'm not insane.

17:03.288 --> 17:08.521
Run, Marge! Run!
Pump those crazy legs!

17:08.627 --> 17:13.257
Police say escaped mental patient
Marge Simpson could be anywhere.

17:13.365 --> 17:17.199
Even here at Juggernauts
where it's wet T-shirt month!

17:17.301 --> 17:19.202
- [Women ] Whoo!
- But for now...

17:19.304 --> 17:24.502
this reporter prays that Mad Marge
can be captured before she kills again.

17:24.609 --> 17:27.204
Kills again?.
She hasn't killed once!

17:27.311 --> 17:29.371
Shouldn’t we be out there
trying to find her?.

17:29.481 --> 17:33.781
Don’t worry. She'll show up here sooner
or later to finish off Becky.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.150
Then we'll have Mommy back.

Now, Ralphie, what are you gonna
do if you see Mrs. Simpson?.

18:17.162 --> 18:19.062
Freeze, you crazy mommy!

18:19.164 --> 18:22.759
That a boy. But you gotta aim
a little higher.

18:22.868 --> 18:24.927
There you go.
That's a kill shot.

18:25.037 --> 18:27.267
Well, we've got a special guest.

18:27.372 --> 18:30.136
She just flew in
from the cuckoo's nest.

18:30.242 --> 18:34.576
And, boy, is she crazy.
Crazy Marge Simpson!

- [ Chuckles ] Look at that.

18:37.015 --> 18:40.143
[ Man's Voice ]
Hello, Krusty.

18:40.252 --> 18:42.777
Oh, that's funny.
So, Marge...

18:42.888 --> 18:45.686
who's your favorite
Native American warrior?.

18:45.791 --> 18:49.022
Crazy Horse!
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

18:49.128 --> 18:51.528
[Blathering]

18:51.630 --> 18:54.793
All right. Stop it!
Oh, this bit's dying.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.460
Let's go to the
Mad Marge Dancers.

18:57.569 --> 19:01.528
##["Sabre Dance"]

19:01.640 --> 19:05.098
- Too soon.
- Oh, I really miss Mom.

19:05.210 --> 19:08.941
The kids are saying if you say
"Bloody Margie" five times, she'll appear.

19:09.047 --> 19:11.283
But then she gouges
your eyes out.

19:11.122 --> 19:13.222
I hear she mates with men, then eats them.

19:14.422 --> 19:16.822
I'm sure if Marge were here and not
         crazy, 

19:17.023 --> 19:18.813
she'd be telling you two
to do your homework...

19:19.324 --> 19:22.452
- and you to finish washing the dog.

who this Becky really is.

[ Groans ]

19:39.144 --> 19:41.237
Hmm!

19:41.346 --> 19:45.112
I really should read
the whole headline before I react.

19:47.619 --> 19:51.715
Oh, my. I've been so unfair to Becky.
Maybe I am insane.

19:51.823 --> 19:53.950
I mean,
I am talking to myself.

19:54.059 --> 19:57.995
You are?. Oh, I thought
I'd made a friend.

20:02.034 --> 20:06.403
Becky, I want to apologize
to- Usurper!

20:12.744 --> 20:14.234

20:16.315 --> 20:18.476
- Why, you little-
- [Bart] Cut. Cut!

20:18.584 --> 20:21.781
Mom, it's great to have you back,
but you walked right into my shot.

20:21.887 --> 20:25.084
- Shot?. What are you-
- I hope we didn't scare you, Marge.

20:25.190 --> 20:28.057
Bart's just filming a music video
for his class project.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.185
And I'm directing
the "making of" video.

20:30.295 --> 20:35.494
Oh. Well, then I guess there's
a reasonable explanation for everything...

20:35.601 --> 20:38.661
except you cutting my brakes.

20:38.770 --> 20:41.261
Oh, about that.
When I changed your oil...

20:41.373 --> 20:43.500
I may have drained
your brake fluid.

20:43.609 --> 20:45.804
I didn't say anything 'cause
I thought you’d be mad.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.776
Oh, boy. My bad.

20:47.879 --> 20:50.507
Becky, I'm so sorry
I accused you...

20:50.649 --> 20:53.083
of trying to kill me
and steal my family.

20:53.185 --> 20:56.416
Hey, no biggie.
I was trying to steal your family.

20:56.521 --> 20:58.614
I even thought of
a good place to bury you.

20:58.724 --> 21:02.160
Then I didn't have a shovel, so I went to the
hardware store. They have six different kinds.

21:02.261 --> 21:07.358
- I was, like, "Later"
- Well, that's a relief, too, knowing I'm not crazy.

21:07.466 --> 21:10.026
So I guess everything
really worked out for the-

21:10.135 --> 21:12.501
- [ Gasps ]
- Mom!

21:12.604 --> 21:15.732
- You monsters! You killed her!
- No, they didn't.

21:15.841 --> 21:17.399
- [ All Gasp ]
- God!

21:17.509 --> 21:20.706
We put enough tranquilizers in there
to take down Jonathan Winters.

21:20.812 --> 21:24.509
Oh, I've got too much to do
to take a nap right now.

21:24.616 --> 21:26.914
Lisa, get Maggie out
of that cage.

21:27.019 --> 21:28.919
And, Homer, since
you're dressed for it...

21:29.021 --> 21:32.787
I got some S & M for ya-
scrubbing and mopping.
