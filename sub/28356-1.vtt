00:45.109 --> 00:47.945
Salutation and
greeting to you all.

00:47.947 --> 00:51.184
Let me have audience
for a word or two.

00:53.352 --> 00:55.786
What's the new news
at the new court?

00:55.788 --> 00:59.790
That is, the old Duke is
banished by his younger brother,

00:59.792 --> 01:01.324
the new Duke,

01:01.326 --> 01:03.025
and three or four loving
lords have put themselves

01:03.027 --> 01:06.363
into voluntary exile with him.

01:06.365 --> 01:09.298
They say he is already
in the Forest of Arden

01:09.300 --> 01:10.801
and a many merry men with him

01:10.803 --> 01:14.170
and there they live like the
old Robin Hood of England.

01:14.172 --> 01:16.873
They say many young gentlemen
flock to him every day

01:16.875 --> 01:19.242
and fleet the time carelessly,

01:19.244 --> 01:21.914
as they did in the golden world.

01:23.348 --> 01:27.851
Rosalind, the Duke's daughter,
be banished with her father.

01:27.853 --> 01:29.385
Oh no.

01:29.387 --> 01:33.156
For the Duke's daughter,
her cousin so loves her,

01:33.158 --> 01:35.358
being ever from their
cradles bred together,

01:35.360 --> 01:38.594
that she would have
followed her exile

01:38.596 --> 01:40.866
or died to stay behind her.

01:42.401 --> 01:44.470
And thereby hangs a tale.

02:28.347 --> 02:32.015
I pray thee, Rosalind,
sweet my cuz, be merry.

02:32.017 --> 02:35.652
Dear Celia, I show more
mirth than I am mistress of,

02:35.654 --> 02:38.154
and would you yet
I were merrier?

02:38.156 --> 02:40.656
Unless you could teach me
to forget a banished father,

02:40.658 --> 02:41.857
you must not learn me

02:41.859 --> 02:43.927
how to remember any
extraordinary pleasure.

02:43.929 --> 02:45.595
Herein I see
thou lovest me not

02:45.597 --> 02:47.230
with the full
weight I love thee.

02:47.232 --> 02:50.733
If my uncle, thy banished
father had banished thy uncle,

02:50.735 --> 02:53.737
the Duke my father, so thou
hadst been s'til with me,

02:53.739 --> 02:56.839
I could have taught my love
to take thy father for mine.

02:56.841 --> 02:58.507
So wouldst thou, if the
truth of thy love to me

02:58.509 --> 03:01.143
were so righteously
tempered as mine is to thee.

03:01.145 --> 03:04.481
Well, I will forget the
condition of my estate

03:04.483 --> 03:06.116
to rejoice in yours.

03:06.118 --> 03:08.517
You know my father
hath no child but I,

03:08.519 --> 03:11.787
nor none is like to have;
and truly, when he dies,

03:11.789 --> 03:13.923
thou shalt be his heir,

03:13.925 --> 03:16.993
for what he hath taken away
from thy father perforce,

03:16.995 --> 03:20.363
I will render thee
again in affection.

03:20.365 --> 03:22.465
By mine honor I will, and
when I break that oath,

03:22.467 --> 03:24.137
let me turn monster.

03:28.740 --> 03:32.744
Therefore my sweet Rose,
my dear Rose, be merry.

03:36.247 --> 03:40.352
From henceforth I will,
cuz, and devise sports.

03:42.019 --> 03:45.054
What think you of
falling in love?

03:45.056 --> 03:47.491
Marry, I prithee do,
to make sport withal;

03:47.493 --> 03:49.593
but love no man in good earnest,

03:49.595 --> 03:50.893
nor no further in sport neither

03:50.895 --> 03:52.762
than with safety of a pure blush

03:52.764 --> 03:55.768
thou mayest in honor
come off again.

04:15.387 --> 04:17.720
As I remember, Adam,
it was upon this fashion

04:17.721 --> 04:21.391
bequeathed me by will but
poor a thousand crowns,

04:21.392 --> 04:22.658
and, as thou sayest,
charged my brother,

04:22.660 --> 04:25.162
on his blessing,
to breed me well.

04:25.164 --> 04:27.396
And there begins my sadness.

04:27.398 --> 04:29.067
He keeps me rustically at home.

04:30.099 --> 04:31.400
Bars me the place of a brother,
and, as much as in him lies,

04:31.402 --> 04:34.506
mines my gentility
with my education.

04:36.107 --> 04:38.374
This is it, Adam,
that grieves me,

04:38.376 --> 04:40.076
and the spirit of my father,
which I think is within me,

04:40.078 --> 04:43.280
begins to mutiny
against this servitude.

04:43.282 --> 04:45.551
I will no longer endure it,

04:47.785 --> 04:51.857
though yet I know no wise
remedy how to avoid it.

05:26.253 --> 05:28.856
Now, sir, what make you here?

05:32.725 --> 05:33.958
Nothing.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.994
I am not taught
to make anything.

05:35.996 --> 05:38.065
What mar you then, sir?

05:39.499 --> 05:42.600
Marry, sir, I am helping you
to mar that which God made.

05:42.602 --> 05:43.735
Know you where you are.

05:43.737 --> 05:45.338
O sir, very well.

05:46.239 --> 05:49.307
Know you before whom, sir?

05:49.309 --> 05:51.843
I know you are
my eldest brother,

05:51.845 --> 05:54.412
and in the gentle condition of
blood you should so know me.

05:54.414 --> 05:57.215
I have as much of my
father in me as you,

05:57.217 --> 05:58.549
albeit I confess
your coming before me

05:58.551 --> 05:59.783
is nearer to his reverence.

05:59.785 --> 06:01.285
What, boy!

06:01.287 --> 06:02.953
Come, come, elder brother,
you are too young in this.

06:02.955 --> 06:06.458
Wilt thou lay
hands on me, villain?

06:06.460 --> 06:07.958
I am no villain.

06:07.960 --> 06:10.295
I am the youngest son
of Sir Rowland de Boys.

06:10.297 --> 06:12.663
He was my father, and
he is thrice a villain

06:12.665 --> 06:15.600
that says such a
father begot villains.

06:15.602 --> 06:16.835
Wert thou not my brother,

06:16.837 --> 06:18.302
I would not take this
hand from thy throat

06:18.304 --> 06:20.405
'til this other had pulled
out thy tongue for saying so.

06:20.407 --> 06:22.107
Thou hast railed on thyself.

06:22.109 --> 06:23.874
Sweet masters, be patient.

06:23.876 --> 06:26.444
For your father's
remembrance, be at accord.

06:26.446 --> 06:27.379
Let me go, I say.

06:27.381 --> 06:29.080
I will not 'til I please.

06:29.082 --> 06:30.915
You shall hear me.

06:30.917 --> 06:35.052
My father charged you in his
will to give me good education.

06:35.054 --> 06:36.554
You have trained
me like a peasant,

06:36.556 --> 06:39.124
obscuring and hiding from me
all gentleman-like qualities.

06:39.126 --> 06:41.992
I will no longer endure it.

06:41.994 --> 06:45.997
Therefore allow me such exercises
as may become a gentleman,

06:45.999 --> 06:46.931
or give me the poor allottery

06:46.933 --> 06:48.133
my father left me by testament.

06:48.135 --> 06:50.701
With that I will
go buy my fortunes.

06:50.703 --> 06:51.535
And what wilt thou do?

06:51.537 --> 06:53.540
Beg, when that is spent?

06:56.575 --> 06:58.977
You shall have some
part of your will.

06:58.979 --> 07:00.748
I pray you, leave me.

07:04.383 --> 07:07.619
I will no further offend you
than becomes me for my good.

07:07.621 --> 07:09.853
Get you with him, you old dog.

07:09.855 --> 07:11.756
Is "old dog" my reward?

07:11.758 --> 07:14.992
Most true, I have lost
my teeth in your service.

07:14.994 --> 07:16.895
God be with my old master.

07:16.897 --> 07:20.598
He would not have
spoke such a word.

07:34.980 --> 07:36.316
Is it even so?

07:37.184 --> 07:39.320
Begin you to grow upon me?

07:43.523 --> 07:44.655
I will physic your rankness,

07:44.657 --> 07:47.961
and yet give no
thousand crowns neither.

08:04.410 --> 08:07.814
I am given, sir,
secretly to understand

08:09.515 --> 08:13.854
that your younger brother
Orlando hath a disposition

08:15.222 --> 08:18.559
to come in disguised
against me to try a fall.

08:20.426 --> 08:23.961
He is resolute;
full of ambition,

08:23.963 --> 08:27.801
an envious emulator of
every man's good parts,

08:30.503 --> 08:31.903
a secret and
villainous contriver

08:31.905 --> 08:34.575
against me, his natural brother.

08:38.078 --> 08:39.778
Therefore use thy discretion.

08:39.780 --> 08:44.217
I had as lief he didst
break his neck as his finger.

08:46.186 --> 08:49.686
he will practice
against thee by poison,

08:49.688 --> 08:52.859
entrap thee by some
treacherous device

08:54.261 --> 08:57.698
and never leave thee 'til
he hath ta'en thy life

08:58.765 --> 09:01.435
by some indirect means or other.

09:04.403 --> 09:08.975
For, I assure thee, and
almost with tears I speak it,

09:10.609 --> 09:15.615
there is not one so young and
so villainous this day living.

09:16.682 --> 09:19.684
I speak but brotherly of him,

09:19.686 --> 09:23.487
but should I anatomize
him to thee as he is,

09:23.489 --> 09:28.329
I must blush and weep, and
thou must look pale and wonder.

09:32.499 --> 09:35.599
I will give him his payment.

09:35.601 --> 09:37.771
If ever he go alone again,

09:41.941 --> 09:44.778
I'll never wrestle
for prize more.

10:21.580 --> 10:23.348
Bonjour, Monsieurs Le Beau.

10:23.350 --> 10:24.848
What's the news?

10:24.850 --> 10:27.150
Fair princess,
you have lost much...

10:27.152 --> 10:28.553
good sport.

10:28.555 --> 10:29.386
Sport?

10:29.388 --> 10:30.557
Of what color?

10:31.725 --> 10:32.924
What color, madam?

10:32.926 --> 10:34.224
How shall we answer you?

10:34.226 --> 10:35.959
As wit and fortune will.

10:35.961 --> 10:38.429
Or as the destinies decrees.

10:38.431 --> 10:39.363
Well said.

10:39.365 --> 10:40.564
That was laid on with a trowel.

10:40.566 --> 10:42.199
Nay, if I keep not my rank.

10:42.201 --> 10:44.234
Thou losest thy old smell.

10:49.643 --> 10:51.809
You amaze us, ladies.

10:51.811 --> 10:53.044
We would have told
you of good wrestling.

10:53.046 --> 10:55.012
Which you have
lost the sight of.

10:55.014 --> 10:56.481
And if it please
your ladyships...

10:56.483 --> 11:00.550
You may see the end for
the best is yet to do.

11:00.552 --> 11:03.724
Shall we see this
wrestling, cousin?

11:23.976 --> 11:25.977
Alas, he is too young.

11:25.979 --> 11:28.114
Yet he looks successfully.

11:46.398 --> 11:48.098
How now, daughter?

11:48.100 --> 11:50.400
Are you crept hither
to watch the wrestling?

11:50.402 --> 11:53.170
Ay, my liege, so
please you give us leave.

11:53.172 --> 11:57.610
You will take little
delight in it, I can tell you.

12:01.815 --> 12:04.781
Come, where is
this young gallant

12:04.783 --> 12:08.419
that is so desirous to
lie with his Mother Earth?

12:08.421 --> 12:10.758
You mean to mock me after,

12:11.992 --> 12:15.062
you should not have
mocked me before.

13:27.901 --> 13:31.803
I am more proud to
be Sir Rowland's son.

13:31.805 --> 13:33.003
And I would not
change that calling

13:33.005 --> 13:35.641
to be adopted heir to Frederick.

13:40.680 --> 13:44.015
Gentle cousin, let us go
thank him and encourage him.

13:44.017 --> 13:45.949
My father's rough and
envious disposition

13:45.951 --> 13:47.520
sticks me at heart.

13:53.292 --> 13:56.059
What is thy name, young man?

13:56.061 --> 13:59.729
Orlando, the youngest
son of Sir Rowland de Boys.

13:59.731 --> 14:02.266
My father loved Sir
Rowland as his soul,

14:02.268 --> 14:06.437
and all the world was
of my father's mind.

14:06.439 --> 14:09.406
Sir, you have well deserved.

14:09.408 --> 14:12.543
If you do keep your
promises in love but justly,

14:12.545 --> 14:15.112
as you have exceeded
all promise,

14:15.114 --> 14:17.518
your mistress shall be happy.

14:22.422 --> 14:24.758
Gentleman, wear this for me.

14:28.494 --> 14:29.993
One out of suits with fortune,

14:29.995 --> 14:33.396
that could give more but
that her hand lacks means.

14:33.398 --> 14:35.266
Sir, you have wrestled well

14:35.268 --> 14:37.801
and overthrown more
than your enemies.

14:37.803 --> 14:38.669
Will you go, cuz?

14:38.671 --> 14:40.271
Have with you.

14:40.273 --> 14:41.340
Fare ye well.

14:45.878 --> 14:48.880
What passion hangs these
weights upon my tongue?

14:48.882 --> 14:53.450
I cannot speak to her,
yet she urged conference.

14:53.452 --> 14:54.687
O poor Orlando!

14:55.854 --> 14:57.523
Thou art overthrown.

14:59.191 --> 15:02.863
Or Charles or something
weaker masters thee.

15:07.566 --> 15:09.967
Good sir, we do in
friendship counsel you

15:09.969 --> 15:11.868
to leave this place.

15:11.870 --> 15:13.371
The Duke is humorous.

15:13.373 --> 15:16.473
What he is indeed
more suits you

15:16.475 --> 15:19.145
to conceive than we to speak of.

15:21.281 --> 15:22.880
I thank you, sirs.

15:22.882 --> 15:25.152
I rest much bounden to you.

15:26.920 --> 15:28.088
Fare you well.

15:41.167 --> 15:43.467
Thus must I from the
smoke into the smother,

15:43.469 --> 15:47.003
from tyrant Duke unto
a tyrant brother.

15:48.675 --> 15:50.511
But heavenly Rosalind!

15:56.449 --> 15:57.618
Why, cousin!

15:58.850 --> 16:00.019
Why, Rosalind!

16:01.486 --> 16:03.890
Cupid have mercy, not a word?

16:06.893 --> 16:08.458
But is all this for your father?

16:08.460 --> 16:11.596
No, some of it is
for my child's father.

16:11.598 --> 16:13.964
Come, come, wrestle
with thy affections.

16:13.966 --> 16:17.267
O, they take the part of a
better wrestler than myself.

16:17.269 --> 16:19.603
Is it possible on such
a sudden you should fall

16:19.605 --> 16:24.610
into so strong a liking with
old Sir Rowland's youngest son?

16:25.744 --> 16:27.444
The Duke my father
loved his father dearly.

16:27.446 --> 16:28.646
Doth it therefore ensue

16:28.648 --> 16:30.680
that you should
love his son dearly?

16:30.682 --> 16:32.449
By this kind of chase
I should hate him,

16:32.451 --> 16:35.151
for my father hated
his father dearly.

16:35.153 --> 16:37.454
Yet I hate not Orlando.

16:37.456 --> 16:40.657
No, faith, hate
him not, for my sake.

16:40.659 --> 16:42.025
Look, here comes the Duke.

16:42.027 --> 16:44.364
With his eyes full of anger.

16:48.868 --> 16:50.668
Mistress, dispatch you

16:50.670 --> 16:54.841
with your safest haste and
get you from our court.

16:56.142 --> 16:57.141
Me, uncle?

16:57.143 --> 16:58.376
You, cousin.

16:58.378 --> 17:00.844
Within these 10 days if
that thou beest found

17:00.846 --> 17:04.748
so near our public court
as 20 miles thou...

17:04.750 --> 17:06.083
I do beseech your grace,

17:06.085 --> 17:08.617
let me the knowledge of
my fault bear with me.

17:08.619 --> 17:12.088
Thou art thy
father's daughter.

17:12.089 --> 17:13.326
There's enough.

17:14.694 --> 17:17.127
So was I when your
Highness took his dukedom.

17:17.128 --> 17:19.597
So was I when your
Highness banished him.

17:19.598 --> 17:21.498
Never so much as
an athought unborn

17:21.500 --> 17:23.067
did I offend your highness.

17:23.069 --> 17:25.402
Thus do all traitors.

17:25.404 --> 17:28.005
If their purgation
did consist in words,

17:28.007 --> 17:31.111
they are as innocent
as grace itself.

17:32.077 --> 17:33.511
Let it suffice thee

17:33.513 --> 17:35.349
that I trust thee not.

17:36.549 --> 17:38.782
If she be a
traitor, why, so am I?

17:38.784 --> 17:42.153
Firm and
irrevocable is my doom

17:42.155 --> 17:44.422
which I have passed upon her.

17:44.424 --> 17:46.490
She is banished.

17:46.492 --> 17:49.492
Pronounce that sentence
then on me, my liege.

17:49.494 --> 17:51.428
I cannot live out
of her company.

17:51.430 --> 17:53.263
You are a fool.

17:53.265 --> 17:56.032
You, niece, provide yourself.

17:56.034 --> 17:57.702
If you outstay the time,

17:57.704 --> 18:01.707
upon mine honor and in
the greatness of my word.

18:14.286 --> 18:18.055
O my poor Rosalind,
whither wilt thou go?

18:18.057 --> 18:19.223
Wilt thou change fathers?

18:19.225 --> 18:20.724
I will give thee mine.

18:20.726 --> 18:22.926
I charge thee, be not thou
more grieved than I am.

18:22.928 --> 18:23.993
I have more cause.

18:23.995 --> 18:25.896
Thou hast not, cousin.

18:25.898 --> 18:27.833
I prithee, be cheerful.

18:29.234 --> 18:31.469
Know'st thou not the Duke hath
banished me, his daughter?

18:31.471 --> 18:32.569
That he hath not.

18:32.571 --> 18:34.571
No, hath not?

18:34.573 --> 18:36.574
Rosalind lacks then the
love which teacheth thee

18:36.576 --> 18:38.675
that thou and I am one.

18:38.677 --> 18:40.176
Shall we be sundered?

18:40.178 --> 18:41.578
Shall we part, sweet girl?

18:41.580 --> 18:44.583
No, let my father
seek another heir.

18:47.520 --> 18:49.986
Therefore devise with
me how we may fly,

18:49.988 --> 18:51.555
whither to go, and
what to bear with us,

18:51.557 --> 18:53.491
and do not seek to bear
your griefs yourself

18:53.493 --> 18:54.759
and leave me out.

18:54.761 --> 18:56.860
For, by this heaven,
now at our sorrows pale,

18:56.862 --> 18:59.562
say what thou canst,
I'll go along with thee.

18:59.564 --> 19:02.399
Why, whither shall we go?

19:02.401 --> 19:05.905
To seek my uncle in
the Forest of Arden.

19:07.072 --> 19:09.005
Alas, what danger
will it be to us,

19:09.007 --> 19:11.242
maids as we are, to
travel forth so far?

19:11.244 --> 19:13.944
Beauty provoketh thieves
sooner than gold.

19:13.946 --> 19:16.480
I'll put myself in
poor and mean attire,

19:16.482 --> 19:19.349
and with a kind of
umber smirch my face.

19:19.351 --> 19:20.818
The like do you.

19:20.820 --> 19:25.222
So shall we pass along
and never stir assailants.

19:25.224 --> 19:26.424
Were it not better,

19:26.426 --> 19:27.825
because that I am
more than common tall,

19:27.827 --> 19:31.263
that I did suit me
all points like a man?

19:35.967 --> 19:39.235
What shall I call thee
when thou art a man?

19:39.237 --> 19:41.938
I'll have no worse a
name than Jove's own page,

19:41.940 --> 19:45.909
and therefore look
you call me Ganymede.

19:45.911 --> 19:48.011
But what will you be called?

19:48.013 --> 19:51.851
Something that hath a
reference to my state:

19:52.717 --> 19:55.054
no longer Celia, but Aliena.

19:57.189 --> 19:59.155
But, cousin,
what if we assayed

19:59.157 --> 20:02.158
to steal master Touchstone
out of your father's court?

20:02.160 --> 20:03.726
Would he not be a
comfort to our travel?

20:03.728 --> 20:06.530
He'll go along o'er
the wide world with me.

20:06.532 --> 20:09.200
Leave me alone to woo him.

20:09.202 --> 20:12.235
Let's away and get our jewels
and our wealth together.

20:12.237 --> 20:16.373
Now go we in content to
liberty and not to banishment.

20:50.542 --> 20:52.812
O Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe.

20:55.313 --> 20:59.015
Now, my co-mates
and brothers in exile,

20:59.017 --> 21:00.617
hath not old custom
made this life

21:00.619 --> 21:04.088
more sweet than that
of painted pomp?

21:04.090 --> 21:06.022
Are not these woods
more free from peril

21:06.024 --> 21:07.960
than the envious court?

21:10.696 --> 21:13.630
Sweet are the uses of adversity.

21:13.632 --> 21:17.136
And this our life
exempt from public haunt

21:18.571 --> 21:22.842
finds tongues in trees,
books in the running brooks,

21:24.644 --> 21:28.013
sermons in stones and
good in everything.

21:32.150 --> 21:34.119
I would not change it.

21:35.788 --> 21:39.557
Happy is your grace, that can
translate the stubbornness

21:39.559 --> 21:43.296
of fortune into so quiet
and so sweet a style.

21:47.332 --> 21:50.669
Come, shall we go
and kill us venison?

22:28.573 --> 22:29.708
Who's there?

22:33.745 --> 22:34.714
Who's there?

22:39.985 --> 22:43.787
O, my gentle master,
O my sweet master,

22:43.789 --> 22:46.459
O you memory of old Sir Rowland!

22:47.326 --> 22:49.592
Why, what make you here?

22:49.594 --> 22:51.595
Come not within these doors.

22:51.597 --> 22:53.896
This is no place, this
house is but a butchery.

22:53.898 --> 22:55.331
With a base and
boisterous sword

22:55.333 --> 22:57.701
enforce a thievish living
on the common road.

22:57.703 --> 22:59.703
This I must do, or
know not what to do.

22:59.705 --> 23:00.838
But do not so.

23:00.840 --> 23:02.839
I have 500 crowns,

23:02.841 --> 23:05.643
the thrifty hire I
saved under your father,

23:05.645 --> 23:07.944
which I did store to
be my foster nurse

23:07.946 --> 23:11.848
when service should in
my old limbs lie lame.

23:11.850 --> 23:13.117
Here is the gold.

23:13.119 --> 23:15.085
All this I give you.

23:15.087 --> 23:16.552
Let me be your servant.

23:16.554 --> 23:18.021
Let me go with you.

23:18.023 --> 23:20.523
O good old man,
how well in thee

23:20.525 --> 23:24.697
appears the constant service
of the antique world.

23:27.899 --> 23:31.969
But come thy ways;
we'll go along together,

23:31.971 --> 23:33.671
and ere we have thy
youthful wages spent,

23:33.673 --> 23:36.005
we'll light upon some
settled low content.

23:36.007 --> 23:39.876
Master, go on, and I will
follow thee to the last gasp,

23:39.878 --> 23:41.715
with truth and loyalty.

23:50.488 --> 23:53.557
Can it be possible
that no man saw them?

23:53.559 --> 23:54.628
It cannot be.

23:55.561 --> 23:58.061
Some villains of my court

23:58.063 --> 24:01.234
are of consent and
sufferance in this.

24:02.368 --> 24:05.469
I cannot hear of
any that did see her.

24:05.471 --> 24:09.639
My lord, I secretly o'erheard
your daughter and her cousin

24:09.641 --> 24:12.142
much commend the parts
and graces of the wrestler

24:12.144 --> 24:15.279
that did but lately
foil the sinewy Charles.

24:15.281 --> 24:19.082
And I believe
wherever they are gone

24:19.084 --> 24:21.851
that youth is surely
in their company.

24:21.853 --> 24:24.687
Fetch that gallant hither.

24:24.689 --> 24:28.492
If he be absent, bring
his brother to me.

24:28.494 --> 24:30.429
I'll make him find him.

24:31.897 --> 24:36.265
Do this suddenly, and let
not search and inquisition

24:36.267 --> 24:39.905
quail to bring again
these foolish runaways.

25:41.300 --> 25:44.367
That is the way to
make her scorn you s'til.

25:44.369 --> 25:46.703
O Corin, that thou
knew'st how I do love her!

25:46.705 --> 25:49.873
I partly guessed, for
I have loved ere now.

25:49.875 --> 25:51.674
But if thy love were
ever like to mine

25:51.676 --> 25:53.876
as sure I think did
never man love so

25:53.878 --> 25:55.646
how many actions most ridiculous

25:55.648 --> 25:57.815
hast thou been drawn
to by thy fantasy?

25:57.817 --> 26:00.716
Into a thousand
that I have forgotten.

26:00.718 --> 26:05.055
O, thou didst then
ne'er love so heartily.

26:05.057 --> 26:07.193
If thou remembr'est
not the slightest folly

26:08.224 --> 26:10.226
that ever love did make thee
run into, thou hast not loved.

26:10.228 --> 26:12.829
Or if thou hast not broke
from company abruptly,

26:12.831 --> 26:16.835
as my passion now makes
me, thou hast not loved.

26:21.372 --> 26:25.975
Alas, poor shepherd,
searching of thy wound,

26:25.977 --> 26:28.377
I have by hard adventure
found mine own.

26:28.379 --> 26:31.748
We that are true lovers
run into strange capers.

26:31.750 --> 26:33.750
But as all is mortal in nature,

26:33.752 --> 26:37.190
so is all nature in
love mortal in folly.

26:40.559 --> 26:41.825
Good even to you, friend.

26:41.827 --> 26:45.265
And to you, gentle
sir, and to you all.

26:46.432 --> 26:48.397
I prithee, shepherd,
if that love or gold

26:48.399 --> 26:51.268
can in this desert
place buy entertainment,

26:51.270 --> 26:54.905
bring us where we may
rest ourselves and feed.

26:54.907 --> 26:57.040
Here's a young maid with
travel much oppressed.

26:57.042 --> 26:58.878
And faints for succor.

27:00.178 --> 27:02.245
My master is of
churlish disposition

27:02.247 --> 27:03.847
and little recks to
find the way to heaven

27:03.849 --> 27:06.683
by doing deeds of hospitality.

27:06.685 --> 27:09.152
Besides, his cote, his
flocks, and bounds of feed

27:09.154 --> 27:12.356
are now on sale, and
at our sheepcote now,

27:12.358 --> 27:13.557
by reason of his absence,

27:13.559 --> 27:16.796
there is nothing that
you will feed on.

27:18.397 --> 27:19.863
But what is, come see,

27:19.865 --> 27:23.369
and in my voice most
welcome shall you be.

28:07.679 --> 28:09.178
I thank it.

28:09.180 --> 28:12.683

a song as a weasel sucks eggs.

They owe me nothing.

28:30.735 --> 28:31.905

30:21.679 --> 30:24.580
I pray thee, if it
stand with honesty,

30:24.582 --> 30:27.416
buy thou the cottage,
pasture, and the flock,

30:27.418 --> 30:29.485
and thou shalt have
to pay for it of us.

30:44.669 --> 30:47.104
I will your very
faithful feeder be

30:47.106 --> 30:50.542
and buy it with your
gold right suddenly.

31:37.255 --> 31:40.993
Not see him since?

31:42.494 --> 31:44.563
Sir, sir, that cannot be.

31:46.298 --> 31:51.003
But look to it, find out thy
brother, wheresoe'er he is.

31:52.137 --> 31:54.740
Bring him, or turn thou no more

31:55.907 --> 31:58.410
to seek a living
in our territory.

32:05.984 --> 32:07.651
Dear master, I
can go no further.

32:07.653 --> 32:09.286
O, I die for food.

32:09.288 --> 32:12.856
Here lie I down and
measure out my grave.

32:12.858 --> 32:14.790
Farewell, kind master.

32:14.792 --> 32:16.158
Why, how now, Adam?

32:16.160 --> 32:18.263
No greater heart in thee?

32:20.831 --> 32:23.732
If this uncouth forest
yield any thing savage,

32:23.734 --> 32:26.603
I will either be food for it
or bring it for food to thee.

32:26.605 --> 32:30.173
Hold death awhile
at the arm's end.

32:30.175 --> 32:31.907
I will here be with
thee presently,

32:31.909 --> 32:33.609
and if I bring thee
not something to eat,

32:33.611 --> 32:35.744
I will give thee leave to die:

32:35.746 --> 32:38.214
but if thou diest before I come,

32:38.216 --> 32:40.652
thou art a mocker of my labor.

32:43.054 --> 32:47.392
Thou lookest cheerly, and
I'll be with thee quickly.

32:48.760 --> 32:51.595
Thou shalt not die
for lack of a dinner,

32:51.597 --> 32:54.867
if there live any
thing in this desert.

33:00.339 --> 33:02.004
Give me leave
to speak my mind,

33:02.006 --> 33:03.706
and I will through and through

33:03.708 --> 33:07.143
cleanse the foul body
of this infected world,

33:07.145 --> 33:10.347
if they will patiently
receive my medicine.

33:10.349 --> 33:11.647
Fie on thee!

33:11.649 --> 33:14.049
I can tell what thou wouldst do.

33:14.051 --> 33:17.287
What, for a counter,
would I do but good?

33:17.289 --> 33:20.690
Most mischievous foul
sin in chiding sin,

33:20.692 --> 33:23.963
for thou thyself hast
been a libertine.

33:26.764 --> 33:27.963
But who comes here?

33:27.965 --> 33:31.434
Forbear,
and eat no more.

33:31.436 --> 33:34.570
Art thou thus boldened,
man, by thy distress,

33:34.572 --> 33:36.606
or else a rude despiser
of good manners,

33:36.608 --> 33:39.908
that in civility thou
seem'st so empty?

33:39.910 --> 33:42.712
You touched my vein at first.

33:42.714 --> 33:44.748
The thorny point
of bare distress

33:44.750 --> 33:47.082
hath ta'en from me the
show of smooth civility.

33:47.084 --> 33:48.550
He dies that touches
any of this fruit

33:48.552 --> 33:50.654
'til I and my
affairs are answered.

33:50.656 --> 33:54.824
An you will not be answered
with reason, I must die.

33:54.826 --> 33:56.358
What would you have?

33:56.360 --> 33:57.594
Your gentleness shall force

33:57.596 --> 33:59.561
more than your force
move us to gentleness.

33:59.563 --> 34:01.931
I almost die for food,
and let me have it.

34:01.933 --> 34:05.771
Sit down and feed, and
welcome to our table.

34:08.306 --> 34:10.141
Speak you so gently?

34:12.577 --> 34:14.176
Pardon me, I pray you.

34:14.178 --> 34:16.378
And therefore sit
you down in gentleness,

34:16.380 --> 34:17.813
and take upon command
what help we have

34:17.815 --> 34:21.150
that to your wanting
may be ministered.

34:21.152 --> 34:23.819
Then but forbear your
food a little while,

34:23.821 --> 34:28.324
as like a doe, I go to find
my fawn and give it food.

34:28.327 --> 34:31.694
There is an old poor man who
after me hath many a weary step

34:31.696 --> 34:33.366
limped in pure love.

34:34.764 --> 34:38.802
'Til he be first sufficed,
oppressed with two weak evils,

34:38.804 --> 34:41.237
age and hunger, I
will not touch a bit.

34:41.239 --> 34:42.471
Go find him out,

34:42.473 --> 34:46.041
and we will nothing
waste 'til you return.

34:46.043 --> 34:50.382
I thank you; and be blessed
for your good comfort.

34:59.991 --> 35:03.025
Thou seest we are
not all alone unhappy.

35:03.027 --> 35:04.694
This wide and universal theater

35:04.696 --> 35:07.297
presents more woeful pageants

35:07.299 --> 35:10.032
than the scene
wherein we play in.

35:13.505 --> 35:15.675
All the world's a stage,

35:17.241 --> 35:21.411
and all the men and
women merely players.

35:21.413 --> 35:25.348
They have their exits
and their entrances,

35:25.350 --> 35:28.753
and one man in his
time plays many parts,

35:30.355 --> 35:31.757
his acts being...

35:36.427 --> 35:37.362
seven ages.

35:39.230 --> 35:44.169
At first the infant, mewling
and puking in the nurse's arms.

35:45.036 --> 35:47.637
And then the whining schoolboy,

35:47.639 --> 35:50.440
with his satchel and
shining morning face,

35:50.442 --> 35:53.946
creeping like snail
unwillingly to school.

35:57.248 --> 36:00.652
And then the lover,
sighing like furnace,

36:02.386 --> 36:06.658
with a woeful ballad made
to his mistress' eyebrow.

36:08.427 --> 36:11.530
Then a soldier, full
of strange oaths

36:14.665 --> 36:18.336
and bearded like the
pard, jealous in honor,

36:20.772 --> 36:23.109
sudden and quick in quarrel,

36:24.543 --> 36:28.948
seeking the bubble reputation
even in the cannon's mouth.

36:31.817 --> 36:34.349
And then the justice,
in fair round

36:34.351 --> 36:36.688
belly with good capon lined,

36:38.190 --> 36:40.326
with eyes severe and beard

36:42.427 --> 36:43.596
of formal cut,

36:47.132 --> 36:50.403
full of wise saws
and modern instances;

36:53.103 --> 36:55.206
and so he plays his part.

36:57.576 --> 36:58.677
The sixth age

37:02.514 --> 37:06.185
shifts into the lean
and slippered pantaloon

37:08.018 --> 37:11.523
with spectacles on
nose and pouch on side,

37:14.292 --> 37:16.125
his youthful hose, well saved,

37:16.127 --> 37:19.297
a world too wide for
his shrunk shank,

37:21.799 --> 37:24.969
and his big manly
voice, turning again

37:26.871 --> 37:28.773
toward childish treble,

37:32.310 --> 37:34.980
pipes and whistles in his sound.

37:39.183 --> 37:44.055
Last scene of all, that ends
this strange eventful history,

37:46.056 --> 37:49.462
is second childishness
and mere oblivion,

37:53.498 --> 37:54.433
sans teeth,

37:57.802 --> 37:58.637
sans eyes,

38:02.540 --> 38:03.475
sans taste,

38:08.413 --> 38:09.748
sans everything.

38:17.589 --> 38:18.424
Welcome.

38:19.857 --> 38:23.425
Set down your venerable
burden, and let him feed.

38:23.427 --> 38:25.261
I thank
you most for him.

38:25.263 --> 38:27.063
So had you need.

38:27.065 --> 38:30.636
I scarce can speak to
thank you for myself.

38:33.371 --> 38:38.043
DUKE, SR.: Give us some
music, and good Amiens, sing.

38:39.110 --> 38:42.744
♪ Blow, blow, thou winter wind ♪

38:42.746 --> 38:47.752
♪ Thou art not so unkind
as man's ingratitude ♪

38:51.255 --> 38:54.456
♪ Thy tooth is not so keen ♪

38:54.458 --> 38:58.293
♪ Because thou art not seen ♪

38:58.295 --> 39:02.898
♪ Though thy breath be rude ♪

39:02.900 --> 39:07.036
♪ Breath be rude ♪

39:07.038 --> 39:12.043
♪ Heigh ho, sing heigh-ho
unto the green holly ♪

39:14.311 --> 39:18.246
♪ Most friendship is feigning,
most loving mere folly ♪

39:18.248 --> 39:21.817
♪ Then, heigh ho, the holly ♪

39:21.819 --> 39:25.323
♪ This life is most jolly ♪

39:30.194 --> 39:33.596
Hang there, my verse,
in witness of my love.

39:33.598 --> 39:37.101
O Rosalind, these trees
shall be my books,

39:39.036 --> 39:40.802
and in their barks my
thoughts I'll character,

39:40.804 --> 39:43.806
that every eye which
in this forest looks

39:43.808 --> 39:47.313
shall see thy virtue
witnessed everywhere.

40:07.264 --> 40:10.800
And how like you this country
life, Master Touchstone?

40:10.802 --> 40:15.808
Truly, shepherd, in respect
of itself, it is a good life;

40:17.275 --> 40:20.913
but in respect that it is a
country life, it is naught.

40:22.246 --> 40:25.581
In respect that it is
solitary, I like it very well;

40:25.583 --> 40:30.422
but in respect that it is
private, it is a very vile life.

40:31.889 --> 40:34.489
Now, in respect it is in the
fields, it pleaseth me well;

40:34.491 --> 40:39.128
but in respect it is not in
the court, it is tedious.

40:39.130 --> 40:41.998
As is it a spare life, look
you, it fits my humor well;

40:42.000 --> 40:45.634
but as there is no
more plenty in it,

40:45.636 --> 40:48.306
it goes much against my stomach.

40:50.909 --> 40:54.079
Hast any philosophy
in thee, shepherd?

40:55.447 --> 40:57.246
No more but that I
know the more one sickens

40:57.248 --> 41:00.049
the worse at ease he is, and
that he that wants money,

41:00.051 --> 41:03.351
means and content is
without three good friends;

41:03.353 --> 41:07.290
that the property of rain
is to wet, and fire to burn;

41:07.292 --> 41:10.192
that good pasture
makes fat sheep,

41:10.194 --> 41:13.663
and that a great cause of
the night is lack of the sun;

41:13.665 --> 41:18.634
that he that hath learned
no wit by nature nor art

41:18.636 --> 41:19.701
may complain of good breeding

41:19.703 --> 41:22.340
or comes of a very dull kindred.

41:24.509 --> 41:26.842
Such a one is a
natural philosopher.

41:26.844 --> 41:29.311
Wast ever in court, shepherd?

41:29.313 --> 41:30.281
No, truly.

41:31.415 --> 41:32.982
Why, if thou
never wast at court,

41:32.984 --> 41:36.351
thou never sawest good manners.

41:36.353 --> 41:38.721
Those that are good
manners at the court

41:38.723 --> 41:40.056
are as ridiculous in the country

41:40.058 --> 41:40.989
as the behavior of the country

41:40.991 --> 41:43.726
is most mockable at the court.

41:43.728 --> 41:47.232
God help thee shallow
man, thou art raw.

41:54.639 --> 41:56.909
Sir, I am a true laborer.

41:58.076 --> 42:00.409
I earn that I eat,
get that I wear,

42:00.411 --> 42:02.811
owe no man hate, envy
no man's happiness,

42:02.813 --> 42:06.616
glad of other men's good,
content with my harm,

42:06.618 --> 42:08.284
and the greatest of my pride

42:08.286 --> 42:11.790
is to see my ewes graze
and my lambs suck.

42:13.157 --> 42:17.425
From the east to western
Ind, no jewel is like Rosalind.

42:17.427 --> 42:18.927
Here comes young
Master Ganymede,

42:18.929 --> 42:20.695
my new mistress's brother.

42:20.697 --> 42:22.498
Her worth, being
mounted on the wind,

42:22.500 --> 42:24.733
through all the
world bears Rosalind.

42:24.735 --> 42:28.204
All the pictures fairest lined
are but black to Rosalind.

42:28.206 --> 42:32.775
Let no face be kept in mind
but the fair of Rosalind.

42:32.777 --> 42:35.076
I'll rhyme you so
eight years together.

42:35.078 --> 42:36.378
Out, fool.

42:36.380 --> 42:39.618
For a taste: If a
hart do lack a hind

42:41.185 --> 42:44.420
let him seek out
Rosalind.

42:44.422 --> 42:46.859
Winter garments must be lined

42:47.991 --> 42:50.061
so must slender Rosalind.

42:51.029 --> 42:53.532
Sweetest nut hath sourest rind

42:55.065 --> 42:57.002
such a nut is Rosalind.

42:59.069 --> 43:01.639
He that sweetest rose will find

43:04.409 --> 43:07.412
must find love's
prick and Rosalind.

43:09.614 --> 43:10.846
This is the very false
gallop of verses.

43:10.848 --> 43:12.348
Why do you infect
yourself with them?

43:12.350 --> 43:14.550
Peace, you dull fool.

43:14.552 --> 43:16.117
I found them on a tree.

43:16.119 --> 43:19.188
Truly, the tree
yields bad fruit.

43:19.190 --> 43:20.121
Peace.

43:20.123 --> 43:22.460
Here comes my sister reading.

43:24.996 --> 43:27.295
Therefore heaven
nature charged

43:27.297 --> 43:29.098
that one body should be filled

43:29.100 --> 43:32.335
with all graces wide-enlarged.

43:32.337 --> 43:37.005
Thus Rosalind of many parts
by heavenly synod was devised,

43:37.007 --> 43:39.442
of many faces, eyes and hearts

43:39.444 --> 43:42.011
to have the touches
dearest prized.

43:44.147 --> 43:46.181
Heaven would that she
these gifts should have,

43:46.183 --> 43:48.853
and I to live and die her slave.

43:49.953 --> 43:51.253
Didst thou hear these verses?

43:51.255 --> 43:52.855
O yes, I heard them all.

43:52.857 --> 43:56.157
For look here what I
found on a palm tree.

43:56.159 --> 43:58.293
Trow you who hath done this?

43:58.295 --> 43:59.795
Is it a man?

43:59.797 --> 44:03.769
And a chain, that you
once wore, about his neck.

44:07.304 --> 44:08.536
Change you color?

44:08.538 --> 44:11.040
Nay, but who is it?

44:11.042 --> 44:12.541
Is it possible?

44:12.543 --> 44:15.411
Nay, I prithee now with
most petitionary vehemence,

44:15.413 --> 44:16.878
tell me who it is.

44:16.880 --> 44:19.748
O wonderful, wonderful,
and most wonderful wonderful,

44:19.750 --> 44:23.786
and yet again wonderful, and
after that out of all whooping!

44:23.788 --> 44:26.054
I prithee take the
cork out of thy mouth,

44:26.056 --> 44:28.357
that I may drink thy tidings.

44:28.359 --> 44:31.694
So you may put a
man in your belly.

44:31.696 --> 44:34.096
What manner of man?

44:34.098 --> 44:36.965
It is young Orlando, that
tripped up the wrestler's heels

44:36.967 --> 44:39.770
and your heart
both in an instant.

44:41.706 --> 44:43.773
Nay, but the
devil take mocking.

44:43.775 --> 44:46.041
Speak sad brow and true maid.

44:46.043 --> 44:48.145
In faith, cuz, 'tis he.

44:49.480 --> 44:50.315
Orlando?

44:51.581 --> 44:53.085
Orlando.

44:57.989 --> 45:02.994
Alas the day, what shall I
do with my doublet and hose?

45:03.927 --> 45:05.360
What did he when
thou saw'st him?

45:05.362 --> 45:06.262
What said he?

45:06.264 --> 45:07.596
How looked he?

45:07.598 --> 45:08.730
Wherein went he?

45:08.732 --> 45:10.532
What makes he here?

45:10.534 --> 45:12.467
Did he ask for me?

45:12.469 --> 45:13.302
Where remains he?

45:13.304 --> 45:14.469
How parted he with thee?

45:14.471 --> 45:15.603
And when shalt
thou see him again?

45:15.605 --> 45:17.206
Answer me in one word.

45:17.208 --> 45:20.409
You must borrow me
Gargantua's mouth first.

45:20.411 --> 45:23.478
'Tis a word too great for
any mouth of this age's size.

45:23.480 --> 45:25.081
To say aye and no
to these particulars

45:25.083 --> 45:27.215
is more than to
answer in a catechism.

45:27.217 --> 45:29.784
But doth he know that
I am in this forest

45:29.786 --> 45:31.555
and in man's apparel?

45:33.090 --> 45:36.391
Looks he as freshly as he
did the day he wrestled?

45:36.393 --> 45:38.326
It is as easy to count atomies

45:38.328 --> 45:41.697
as to resolve the
propositions of a lover.

45:41.699 --> 45:44.866
But take a taste
of my finding him,

45:44.868 --> 45:47.805
and relish it with
good observance.

45:48.973 --> 45:52.375
I found him under a tree
like a dropped acorn.

45:52.377 --> 45:54.476
It may well be
called Jove's tree,

45:54.478 --> 45:56.545
when it drops forth such fruit.

45:56.547 --> 45:58.681
Give me audience, good madam.

45:58.683 --> 45:59.518
Proceed.

46:00.951 --> 46:04.453
There lay he, stretched
along like a wounded knight.

46:04.455 --> 46:06.054
Though it be pity
to see such a sight,

46:06.056 --> 46:07.790
it well becomes the ground.

46:07.792 --> 46:09.958
Cry holla to thy
tongue, I prithee.

46:09.960 --> 46:11.964
It curvets unseasonably.

46:13.163 --> 46:14.896
He was furnished like a hunter.

46:14.898 --> 46:15.998
O, ominous!

46:16.000 --> 46:17.699
He comes to kill my heart.

46:17.701 --> 46:19.034
I would sing my
song without a burden.

46:19.036 --> 46:21.070
Thou bring'st me out of tune.

46:21.072 --> 46:23.204
Do you not know I am a woman?

46:23.206 --> 46:25.444
When I think, I must speak.

46:26.710 --> 46:28.710
Sweet, say on.

46:28.712 --> 46:30.281
You bring me out.

46:31.281 --> 46:32.581
'Tis he.

46:32.583 --> 46:34.315
Slink by, and note him.

46:52.469 --> 46:54.904
I thank you for your
company, but, good faith,

46:54.906 --> 46:56.938
I had as lief have
been myself alone.

46:56.940 --> 46:59.241
And so had I, but
yet, for fashion sake,

46:59.243 --> 47:00.742
I thank you too
for your society.

47:00.744 --> 47:01.677
God be wi' you.

47:01.679 --> 47:03.311
Let's meet as little as we can.

47:03.313 --> 47:05.713
I do desire we may
be better strangers.

47:05.715 --> 47:08.683
I pray you mar no more trees

47:08.685 --> 47:10.920
with writing love
songs in their barks.

47:10.922 --> 47:12.353
I pray you mar no
more of my verses

47:12.355 --> 47:13.822
with reading them ill-favoredly.

47:13.824 --> 47:15.291
Rosalind is your love's name?

47:15.293 --> 47:16.224
Yes, just.

47:16.226 --> 47:18.427
I do not like her name.

47:18.429 --> 47:19.395
There was no thought
of pleasing you

47:19.397 --> 47:20.663
when she was christened.

47:20.665 --> 47:22.598
What stature is she of?

47:22.600 --> 47:24.532
Just as high as my heart.

47:24.534 --> 47:25.900
You have a nimble wit.

47:25.902 --> 47:27.570
Will you sit down with me?

47:27.572 --> 47:30.773
And we two will rail
against our mistress

47:30.775 --> 47:33.308
the world and all our misery.

47:33.310 --> 47:35.777
I will chide no breather
in the world but myself,

47:35.779 --> 47:37.645
against whom I know most faults.

47:37.647 --> 47:40.282
The worst fault you
have is to be in love.

47:40.284 --> 47:43.384
'Tis a fault I will not
change for your best virtue.

47:43.386 --> 47:45.186
By my troth, I was out

47:45.188 --> 47:47.857
seeking for a fool
when I found you.

47:47.859 --> 47:49.090
He is drowned in the brook.

47:49.092 --> 47:50.291
Look but in, and
you shall see him.

47:50.293 --> 47:53.395
There I shall
see mine own figure.

47:53.397 --> 47:56.364
Which I take to be
either a fool or a cipher.

47:56.366 --> 47:58.134
I'll tarry no longer with you.

47:58.136 --> 48:00.136
Farewell, good Senor Love.

48:00.138 --> 48:03.808
Adieu, good
Monsieur Melancholy.

48:24.127 --> 48:26.695
I will speak to him
like a saucy lackey,

48:26.697 --> 48:29.565
and under that habit
play the knave with him.

48:29.567 --> 48:31.833
Do you hear, forester?

48:31.835 --> 48:33.201
Very well.

48:33.203 --> 48:34.438
What would you?

48:35.839 --> 48:38.641
I pray you, what
is 't o'clock?

48:38.643 --> 48:40.074
You should ask me
what time o' day.

48:40.076 --> 48:42.411
There's no clock in the forest.

48:42.413 --> 48:44.947
Then there is no true
lover in the forest;

48:44.949 --> 48:47.049
else sighing every minute
and groaning every hour

48:47.051 --> 48:51.152
would detect the lazy foot
of time as well as a clock.

48:51.154 --> 48:53.154
And why not the
swift foot of time?

48:53.156 --> 48:54.956
Had not that been as proper?

48:54.958 --> 48:56.592
By no means, sir.

48:56.594 --> 49:00.866
Time travels in diverse
paces with diverse persons.

49:01.965 --> 49:05.333
Where dwell you, pretty youth?

49:05.335 --> 49:07.770
With this shepherdess.

49:07.772 --> 49:11.373
My sister, here in the
skirts of the forest,

49:11.375 --> 49:13.909
like fringe upon a petticoat.

49:13.911 --> 49:15.411
Are you native of this place?

49:15.413 --> 49:19.480
As the cony that you see
dwell where she is kindled.

49:19.482 --> 49:20.983
Your accent is something finer

49:20.985 --> 49:24.253
than you could purchase
in so removed a dwelling.

49:24.255 --> 49:26.758
I have been told so of many:

49:27.924 --> 49:30.992
but indeed an old
religious uncle of mine

49:30.994 --> 49:32.460
taught me to speak.

49:32.462 --> 49:36.764
One that knew courtship too
well, for there he fell in love.

49:36.766 --> 49:39.835
I have heard him read
many lectures against it,

49:39.837 --> 49:42.737
and I thank God
I am not a woman,

49:42.739 --> 49:45.273
to be touched with so
many giddy offenses

49:45.275 --> 49:48.944
as he hath generally taxed
their whole sex withal.

49:48.946 --> 49:51.679
Can you remember any
of the principal evils

49:51.681 --> 49:54.083
that he laid to the
charge of women?

49:54.085 --> 49:55.683
There were none principal.

49:55.685 --> 49:58.387
They were all like one
another as halfpence are,

49:58.389 --> 49:59.887
every one fault
seeming monstrous

49:59.889 --> 50:03.025
'til his fellow fault
came to match it.

50:03.027 --> 50:05.594
I prithee recount
some of them.

50:05.596 --> 50:07.395
No, I will not
cast away my physic

50:07.397 --> 50:08.896
but on those that are sick.

50:08.898 --> 50:11.400
There is a man haunts the forest

50:11.402 --> 50:13.268
that abuses our young plants

50:13.270 --> 50:16.137
with carving Rosalind
on their barks,

50:16.139 --> 50:18.773
hangs odes upon hawthorns
and elegies on brambles,

50:18.775 --> 50:22.777
all forsooth, deifying
the name of Rosalind.

50:22.779 --> 50:25.246
If I could meet
that fancy-monger

50:25.248 --> 50:27.616
I would give him
some good counsel,

50:27.618 --> 50:31.186
for he seems to have the
quotidian of love upon him.

50:31.188 --> 50:33.087
I am he that is
so love-shaked.

50:33.089 --> 50:35.659
I pray you tell me your remedy.

50:39.462 --> 50:42.331
There is none of my
uncle's marks upon you.

50:42.333 --> 50:44.699
He taught me how to
know a man in love,

50:44.701 --> 50:47.770
in which cage of rushes I am
sure you are not prisoner.

50:47.772 --> 50:50.239
What were his marks?

50:50.241 --> 50:53.241
A lean cheek,
which you have not;

50:53.243 --> 50:56.411
a blue eye and sunken,
which you have not;

50:56.413 --> 50:59.014
an unquestionable spirit,
which you have not;

50:59.016 --> 51:01.583
a beard neglected,
which you have not,

51:01.585 --> 51:03.918
but I pardon you for that,
for simply your having

51:03.920 --> 51:06.989
in beard is a younger
brother's revenue.

51:06.991 --> 51:10.826
Then your hose should be
ungartered, your bonnet unbanded,

51:10.828 --> 51:12.494
your sleeve unbuttoned,
your shoe untied

51:12.496 --> 51:13.695
and everything about you

51:13.697 --> 51:16.600
demonstrating a
careless desolation.

51:19.436 --> 51:21.036
But you are no such man.

51:21.038 --> 51:24.239
You are rather point-device
in your accoutrements,

51:24.241 --> 51:29.043
as loving yourself than
seeming the lover of any other.

51:29.045 --> 51:30.779
Fair youth,
I would I could make thee

51:30.781 --> 51:31.813
believe I love.

51:31.815 --> 51:33.349
Me believe it!

51:33.351 --> 51:35.650
You may as soon make her
that you love believe it.

51:35.652 --> 51:40.255
But, in good sooth, are you
he that hangs the verses

51:40.257 --> 51:42.657
on the trees, wherein
Rosalind is so admired?

51:42.659 --> 51:43.791
I swear
to thee, youth,

51:43.793 --> 51:46.728
by the white hand of Rosalind,

51:46.730 --> 51:49.566
I am that he, that
unfortunate he.

51:51.000 --> 51:54.369
But are you so much in
love as your rhymes speak?

51:54.371 --> 51:58.273
Neither rhyme nor reason
can express how much.

51:58.275 --> 52:01.210
Love is merely a madness.

52:01.212 --> 52:04.114
Yet I profess curing
it by counsel.

52:05.215 --> 52:06.648
Did you ever cure any so?

52:06.650 --> 52:09.253
Yes, one, and in this manner.

52:10.654 --> 52:14.326
He was to imagine me
his love, his mistress,

52:18.763 --> 52:21.529
and I set him every
day to woo me;

52:21.531 --> 52:24.565
at which time would I,
being but a moonish youth,

52:24.567 --> 52:27.371
grieve, be effeminate,
changeable,

52:29.206 --> 52:33.608
longing and liking, proud,
fantastical, apish, shallow,

52:33.610 --> 52:37.081
inconstant, full of
tears, full of smiles,

52:38.181 --> 52:39.648
for every passion something,

52:39.650 --> 52:42.387
and for no passion
truly anything,

52:43.487 --> 52:45.052
as boys and women are,

52:45.054 --> 52:47.355
for the most part
cattle of this color;

52:47.357 --> 52:52.363
would now like him, now loathe
him, then entertain him,

52:53.797 --> 52:56.864
then forswear him, now weep
for him, then spit at him,

52:56.866 --> 52:59.701
that I drave my suitor
from his mad humor of love

52:59.703 --> 53:01.670
to a living humor of madness,

53:01.672 --> 53:04.440
which was to forswear the
full stream of the world,

53:04.442 --> 53:07.612
and to live in a
nook merely monastic.

53:08.645 --> 53:10.381
And thus I cured him,

53:13.484 --> 53:17.686
and this way will I take
upon me to wash your liver

53:17.688 --> 53:20.755
as clean as a sound
sheep's heart,

53:20.757 --> 53:24.125
that there shall not be
one spot of love in 't.

53:24.127 --> 53:25.761
I would not be cured, youth.

53:25.763 --> 53:30.498
I would cure you, if you
would but call me Rosalind

53:30.500 --> 53:33.904
and come every day to
my cote and woo me.

53:36.840 --> 53:38.440
Now, by the faith
of my love, I will.

53:38.442 --> 53:40.078
Tell me where it is.

53:43.913 --> 53:47.014
Go with me to it,
and I'll show it you;

53:47.016 --> 53:48.016
and by the way you shall tell me

53:48.018 --> 53:50.886
where in the forest you live.

53:50.888 --> 53:52.688
Will you go?

53:52.690 --> 53:54.255
With all my heart, good youth.

53:54.257 --> 53:56.160
Nay, you must call me

53:59.630 --> 54:00.465
Rosalind.

54:04.368 --> 54:06.538
Come, sister, will you go?

54:12.976 --> 54:14.442
And how, Audrey?

54:14.444 --> 54:16.210
Am I the man yet?

54:16.212 --> 54:19.114
Doth my simple
features content you?

54:19.116 --> 54:20.748
Your features,
Lord warrant us!

54:20.750 --> 54:22.284
What features?

54:22.286 --> 54:25.020
I am here with thee, as
the most capricious poet,

54:25.022 --> 54:27.792
honest Ovid, was
among the Goths.

54:29.793 --> 54:32.226
When a man's verses
cannot be understood,

54:32.228 --> 54:34.663
nor a man's good wit seconded
with the forward child,

54:34.665 --> 54:37.199
understanding, it
strikes a man more dead

54:37.201 --> 54:40.472
than a great reckoning
in a little room.

54:42.339 --> 54:44.840
Truly, I would the gods
had made thee poetical.

54:44.842 --> 54:46.708
I do not know
what poetical is.

54:46.710 --> 54:48.610
Is it honest in deed and word?

54:48.612 --> 54:49.844
Is it a true thing?

54:49.846 --> 54:52.484
No, truly, for
the truest poetry

54:54.083 --> 54:55.853
is the most feigning;

54:56.819 --> 54:59.423
and lovers are given to poetry,

55:01.424 --> 55:04.960
and what they swear
in poetry may be said

55:04.962 --> 55:06.965
as lovers they do feign.

55:08.565 --> 55:09.831
Do you wish, then,

55:09.833 --> 55:11.233
that the gods had
made me poetical?

55:11.235 --> 55:15.240
I do, truly, for thou
swear'st to me thou art honest.

55:16.139 --> 55:18.340
Now, if thou wert a poet,

55:18.342 --> 55:21.009
I might have some
hope thou didst feign.

55:21.011 --> 55:22.476
Would you not have me honest?

55:22.478 --> 55:25.984
No, truly, unless
thou wert hardfavored;

55:27.150 --> 55:28.817
for honesty coupled to beauty

55:28.819 --> 55:32.219
is to have honey
a sauce to sugar.

55:32.221 --> 55:33.855
Well, I am not fair,

55:33.857 --> 55:36.692
and therefore I pray
the gods make me honest.

55:36.694 --> 55:40.295
Truly, and to cast away
honesty upon a foul slut

55:40.297 --> 55:42.764
were to put good meat
into an unclean dish.

55:42.766 --> 55:46.934
I am not a slut, though
I thank the gods I am foul.

55:46.936 --> 55:50.538
Well, praised be the
gods for thy foulness;

55:50.540 --> 55:53.210
sluttishness may come hereafter.

55:56.547 --> 55:58.449
But be it as it may be,

56:01.585 --> 56:03.087
I will marry thee.

56:05.255 --> 56:08.123
Is there none here
to give the woman?

56:08.125 --> 56:10.525
Will you be married, motley?

56:10.527 --> 56:14.329
As the ox hath his bow,
sir, the horse his curb,

56:14.331 --> 56:18.503
and the falcon her bells,
so man hath his desires;

56:19.936 --> 56:24.042
and as pigeons bill, so
wedlock would be nibbling.

56:25.509 --> 56:28.076
And will you, being
a man of your breeding,

56:28.078 --> 56:31.947
be married under a
bush like a beggar?

56:31.949 --> 56:34.148
Get you to church,
and have a good priest

56:34.150 --> 56:36.985
that can tell you
what marriage is.

56:36.987 --> 56:38.552
It will be a good
excuse for me hereafter

56:38.554 --> 56:39.957
to leave my wife.

56:41.558 --> 56:45.128
Go thou with me, and
let me counsel thee.

56:46.063 --> 56:48.063
Come, sweet Audrey.

56:48.065 --> 56:51.903
We must be married, or
we must live in bawdry.

57:23.833 --> 57:25.000
Never talk to me.

57:25.002 --> 57:26.233
I will weep.

57:26.235 --> 57:28.302
Do, I prithee, but
yet have the grace

57:28.304 --> 57:31.139
to consider that tears
do not become a man.

57:31.141 --> 57:33.074
But have I not cause to weep?

57:33.076 --> 57:35.409
As good cause as
one would desire.

57:35.411 --> 57:37.344
Therefore weep.

57:37.346 --> 57:40.951
His very hair is of
the dissembling color.

57:42.351 --> 57:45.522
And his kissing is
as full of sanctity

57:46.456 --> 57:49.023
as the touch of holy bread.

57:49.025 --> 57:52.761
The very ice of
chastity is in them.

57:52.763 --> 57:55.096
But why did he say he
would come this morning,

57:55.098 --> 57:56.364
and comes not?

57:56.366 --> 57:58.866
Nay, certainly, there
is no truth in him.

57:58.868 --> 57:59.701
Do you think so?

57:59.703 --> 58:00.538
Yes.

58:01.839 --> 58:04.706
I think he is not a pickpurse
nor a horse-stealer,

58:04.708 --> 58:08.710
but for his verity in love,
I do think him as concave

58:08.712 --> 58:11.413
as a covered goblet
or a worm-eaten nut.

58:11.415 --> 58:12.880
Not true in love?

58:12.882 --> 58:16.384
Yes, when he is in,
but I think he is not in.

58:16.386 --> 58:19.020
You have heard him
swear downright he was.

58:19.022 --> 58:20.357
Was is not is.

58:21.458 --> 58:22.690
Besides, the oath of a lover

58:22.692 --> 58:26.062
is no stronger than
the word of a tapster.

58:29.132 --> 58:32.366
He attends here in the forest
on the Duke your father.

58:32.368 --> 58:33.634
What talk we of fathers

58:33.636 --> 58:36.273
when there is such
a man as Orlando?

58:38.674 --> 58:40.077
Who comes here?

58:43.179 --> 58:47.181
Mistress and master,
you have oft inquired

58:47.183 --> 58:50.152
after the shepherd that
complained of love.

58:50.154 --> 58:53.154
Well, and what of him?

58:53.156 --> 58:55.322
If you will see a
pageant truly played,

58:55.324 --> 58:57.192
between the pale
complexion of true love

58:57.194 --> 59:00.864
and the red glow of
scorn and proud disdain,

59:03.833 --> 59:05.333
go hence a little and
I shall conduct you

59:05.335 --> 59:07.101
if you will mark it.

59:07.103 --> 59:08.536
O come, let us remove.

59:08.538 --> 59:12.706
The sight of lovers
feedeth those in love.

59:12.708 --> 59:14.476
Bring us to this sight,

59:14.478 --> 59:19.150
and you shall say I'll prove
a busy actor in their play.

59:31.360 --> 59:33.527
Sweet Phoebe, do not scorn me.

59:33.529 --> 59:36.130
Say that you love me not,
but say not so in bitterness.

59:36.132 --> 59:37.398
Will you sterner be

59:37.400 --> 59:39.333
than he that dies and
lives by bloody drops?

59:39.335 --> 59:41.203
I would not be
thy executioner.

59:41.205 --> 59:44.672
I fly thee, for I
would not injure thee.

59:44.674 --> 59:47.409
O dear Phoebe, if ever,
as that ever may be near,

59:47.411 --> 59:49.610
you meet in some fresh
cheek the power of fancy,

59:49.612 --> 59:50.978
then shall you know
the wounds invisible

59:50.980 --> 59:52.880
that love's keen arrows make.

59:52.882 --> 59:56.016
But 'til that time
come not thou near me:

59:56.018 --> 59:58.520
and when that time comes,
afflict me with thy mocks,

59:58.522 --> 01:00:02.927
pity me not, as 'til that
time I shall not pity thee.

01:00:04.728 --> 01:00:06.563
And why, I pray you?

01:00:08.098 --> 01:00:09.563
Who might be your mother,

01:00:09.565 --> 01:00:12.967
that you insult, exult, and
all at once, over the wretched?

01:00:12.969 --> 01:00:15.070
What though you have no beauty,

01:00:15.072 --> 01:00:17.505
as, by my faith, I
see no more in you

01:00:17.507 --> 01:00:21.041
than without candle
may go dark to bed,

01:00:21.043 --> 01:00:24.482
must you be therefore
proud and pitiless?

01:00:26.482 --> 01:00:28.849
Why, what means this?

01:00:28.851 --> 01:00:32.253
Why look you on me?

01:00:32.255 --> 01:00:33.487
I see no more in you

01:00:33.489 --> 01:00:36.960
than in the ordinary
of nature's sale-work.

01:00:37.895 --> 01:00:40.762
'Od's my little life,

01:00:40.764 --> 01:00:43.965
I think she means to
tangle my eyes too.

01:00:43.967 --> 01:00:48.436
No, faith, proud mistress,
hope not after it.

01:00:48.438 --> 01:00:51.806
'Tis not your inky brows,
your black silk hair,

01:00:51.808 --> 01:00:54.675
your bugle eyeballs,
nor your cheek of cream,

01:00:54.677 --> 01:00:58.281
that can entame my
spirits to your worship.

01:00:59.650 --> 01:01:03.617
You foolish shepherd,
wherefore do you follow her,

01:01:03.619 --> 01:01:07.221
like foggy south puffing
with wind and rain?

01:01:07.223 --> 01:01:11.995
You are a thousand times a
properer man than she a woman.

01:01:13.196 --> 01:01:14.695
'Tis such fools as you

01:01:14.697 --> 01:01:17.498
that makes the world full
of ill-favored children.

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:19.800
But, mistress, know yourself.

01:01:19.802 --> 01:01:21.936
Down on your knees
and thank heaven,

01:01:21.938 --> 01:01:24.605
fasting, for a good man's love,

01:01:24.607 --> 01:01:28.011
for I must tell you
friendly in your ear:

01:01:29.212 --> 01:01:33.083
sell when you can; you
are not for all markets.

01:01:34.284 --> 01:01:37.922
Cry the man mercy, love
him, take his offer.

01:01:39.723 --> 01:01:42.590
Foul is most foul, being
foul to be a scoffer.

01:01:42.592 --> 01:01:44.826
So take her to thee, shepherd.

01:01:44.828 --> 01:01:46.293
Fare you well.

01:01:46.295 --> 01:01:49.663
Sweet youth, I pray you,
chide a year together.

01:01:49.665 --> 01:01:53.134
I had rather hear you
chide than this man woo.

01:01:53.136 --> 01:01:56.204
He's fall'n in love
with your foulness.

01:01:56.206 --> 01:01:58.473
Why look you so upon me?

01:01:58.475 --> 01:02:01.009
For no ill will I bear you.

01:02:01.011 --> 01:02:03.677
I pray you, do not
fall in love with me,

01:02:03.679 --> 01:02:07.282
for I am falser than
vows made in wine.

01:02:07.284 --> 01:02:09.016
Besides, I like you not.

01:02:09.018 --> 01:02:10.687
Will you go, sister?

01:02:15.692 --> 01:02:17.594
Shepherd, ply her hard.

01:02:21.565 --> 01:02:26.134
Shepherdess, look on him
better, and be not proud.

01:02:26.136 --> 01:02:27.701
Though all the world could see,

01:02:27.703 --> 01:02:30.941
none could be so
abused in sight as he.

01:02:39.049 --> 01:02:42.650
Dead shepherd, now I
find thy saw of might:

01:02:42.652 --> 01:02:44.184
Who ever loved that
loved not at first sight?

01:02:44.186 --> 01:02:45.119
Sweet Phoebe.

01:02:45.121 --> 01:02:47.021
What sayst thou, Silvius?

01:02:47.023 --> 01:02:48.288
Sweet Phoebe, pity me.

01:02:48.290 --> 01:02:50.958
Why, I am sorry for
thee, gentle Silvius.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:53.161
Wherever sorrow
is, relief would be.

01:02:53.163 --> 01:02:55.195
If you do sorrow at
my grief in love,

01:02:55.197 --> 01:02:56.864
by giving love your
sorrow and my grief

01:02:56.866 --> 01:02:57.699
were both extermined.

01:02:57.701 --> 01:02:59.433
Thou hast my love.

01:02:59.435 --> 01:03:01.201
Is not that neighborly?

01:03:01.203 --> 01:03:02.137
I would have you.

01:03:02.139 --> 01:03:04.575
Why, that were covetousness.

01:03:06.109 --> 01:03:07.875
Silvius, the time was
that I hated thee;

01:03:07.877 --> 01:03:09.444
and yet it is not
that I bear thee love,

01:03:09.446 --> 01:03:11.311
but since that thou canst
talk of love so well,

01:03:11.313 --> 01:03:14.616
thy company, which
erst was irksome to me,

01:03:14.618 --> 01:03:17.955
I will endure, and
I'll employ thee too.

01:03:19.121 --> 01:03:20.454
But do not look for
further recompense

01:03:20.456 --> 01:03:23.891
than thine own gladness
that thou art employed.

01:03:23.893 --> 01:03:25.092
Loose now and then
a scattered smile

01:03:25.094 --> 01:03:27.161
and that I'll live upon.

01:03:27.163 --> 01:03:29.931
Know'st thou the youth
that spoke to me erewhile?

01:03:29.933 --> 01:03:32.400
Not very well, but
I have met him oft,

01:03:32.402 --> 01:03:33.835
and he hath bought the
cottage and the grounds

01:03:33.837 --> 01:03:35.936
that the old carlot
once was master of.

01:03:35.938 --> 01:03:37.605
Think not I love him,
though I ask for him.

01:03:37.607 --> 01:03:39.474
'Tis but a peevish boy.

01:03:39.476 --> 01:03:43.110
Yet he talks well, but
what care I for words?

01:03:43.112 --> 01:03:44.813
Yet words do well when
he that speaks them

01:03:44.815 --> 01:03:46.380
pleases those that hear.

01:03:46.382 --> 01:03:49.884
It is a pretty youth,
not very pretty,

01:03:49.886 --> 01:03:52.286
but sure he's proud and
yet his pride becomes him.

01:03:52.288 --> 01:03:54.355
He'll make a proper man.

01:03:54.357 --> 01:03:56.424
The best thing in him
is his complexion;

01:03:56.426 --> 01:03:58.159
and faster than his
tongue did make offense

01:03:58.161 --> 01:04:00.063
his eye did heal it up.

01:04:01.498 --> 01:04:04.866
There was a pretty
redness in his lip,

01:04:04.868 --> 01:04:06.567
a little riper
and more lusty red

01:04:06.569 --> 01:04:08.902
than that mixed in his cheek.

01:04:08.904 --> 01:04:11.271
There be some women, Silvius,

01:04:11.273 --> 01:04:12.840
had they marked him
in parcels as I did,

01:04:12.842 --> 01:04:14.576
would have gone near to
fall in love with him;

01:04:14.578 --> 01:04:15.913
but for my part,

01:04:17.179 --> 01:04:19.850
I love him not nor hate him not;

01:04:23.219 --> 01:04:27.654
and yet I have more cause to
hate him than to love him.

01:04:27.656 --> 01:04:29.556
I'll write to him a
very taunting letter,

01:04:29.558 --> 01:04:31.525
and thou shalt bear it.

01:04:31.527 --> 01:04:33.761
Wilt thou, Silvius?

01:04:33.763 --> 01:04:35.195
Phoebe, with all my heart.

01:04:35.197 --> 01:04:36.931
I'll write it straight.

01:04:36.933 --> 01:04:38.933
The matter is in my
head and in my heart.

01:04:38.935 --> 01:04:42.505
I will be bitter with
him and passing short.

01:04:46.543 --> 01:04:51.549
Why, how now, Orlando, where
have you been all this while?

01:04:52.148 --> 01:04:52.650
You a lover?

01:04:53.782 --> 01:04:56.217
And you serve me
such another trick,

01:04:56.219 --> 01:04:58.052
never come in my sight more.

01:04:58.054 --> 01:05:02.056
My fair Rosalind, I come
within an hour of my promise.

01:05:02.058 --> 01:05:04.893
Break an hour's
promise in love!

01:05:04.895 --> 01:05:07.561
He that will divide a
minute into a thousand parts

01:05:07.563 --> 01:05:10.465
and break but a part of the
thousand part of a minute

01:05:10.467 --> 01:05:12.366
in the affairs of love,
it may be said of him

01:05:12.368 --> 01:05:14.134
that Cupid hath clapped
him o' th' shoulder,

01:05:14.136 --> 01:05:16.804
but I'll warrant
him heart-whole.

01:05:16.806 --> 01:05:18.338
Pardon me, dear Rosalind.

01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:22.009
Nay, an you be so tardy,
come no more in my sight.

01:05:22.011 --> 01:05:24.878
I had as lief be
wooed of a snail.

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:26.114
A snail?

01:05:26.116 --> 01:05:29.317
Ay, of a snail, for
though he comes slowly,

01:05:29.319 --> 01:05:33.221
he carries his house on his
head, a better jointure,

01:05:33.223 --> 01:05:35.826
I think, than you make a woman.

01:05:40.697 --> 01:05:42.931
Besides he brings
his destiny with him.

01:05:42.933 --> 01:05:43.764
What's that?

01:05:43.766 --> 01:05:45.266
Why, horns.

01:05:45.268 --> 01:05:48.402
Virtue is no hornmaker,
and my Rosalind is virtuous.

01:05:48.404 --> 01:05:50.371
And I am your Rosalind.

01:05:50.373 --> 01:05:51.873
It pleases him to call you so,

01:05:51.875 --> 01:05:55.946
but he hath a Rosalind of
a better leer than you.

01:06:09.159 --> 01:06:11.391
Come, woo me, woo me,

01:06:11.393 --> 01:06:12.994
for now I am in a holiday humor

01:06:12.996 --> 01:06:15.730
and like enough to consent.

01:06:15.732 --> 01:06:17.699
What would you say to me now,

01:06:17.701 --> 01:06:21.034
an I were your
very, very Rosalind?

01:06:21.036 --> 01:06:22.237
I would kiss before I spoke.

01:06:22.239 --> 01:06:24.038
Nay, you were
better speak first,

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.806
and if you were gravel=led
for lack of matter,

01:06:25.808 --> 01:06:28.375
you might take occasion to kiss.

01:06:28.377 --> 01:06:29.643
What if the kiss be denied?

01:06:29.645 --> 01:06:31.045
Then she puts you to entreaty,

01:06:31.047 --> 01:06:32.679
and there begins new matter.

01:06:32.681 --> 01:06:35.215
Who could be out, being
before his beloved mistress?

01:06:35.217 --> 01:06:38.085
Marry, that should you
if I were your mistress,

01:06:38.087 --> 01:06:40.822
or I should think my
honesty ranker than my wit.

01:06:40.824 --> 01:06:43.224
What, of my suit?

01:06:43.226 --> 01:06:47.565
Not out of your apparel,
and yet out of your suit.

01:06:50.132 --> 01:06:52.069
Am not I your Rosalind?

01:06:54.170 --> 01:06:55.402
I take some joy to say you are

01:06:55.404 --> 01:06:58.405
because I would
be talking of her.

01:06:58.407 --> 01:07:01.808
Well, in her person
I say I will not have you.

01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:04.311
Then, in mine
own person I die.

01:07:04.313 --> 01:07:06.547
No, faith, die by attorney.

01:07:06.549 --> 01:07:09.717
Men have died from time to
time, and worms have eaten them,

01:07:09.719 --> 01:07:11.121
but not for love.

01:07:12.855 --> 01:07:14.087
I would not have my right
Rosalind of this mind,

01:07:14.089 --> 01:07:17.227
for I protest, her
frown might kill me.

01:07:18.627 --> 01:07:21.898
By this hand, it
will not kill a fly.

01:07:24.333 --> 01:07:27.000
But come, now I will
be your Rosalind

01:07:27.002 --> 01:07:31.139
in a more coming-on disposition,
and ask me what you will.

01:07:31.141 --> 01:07:32.607
I will grant it.

01:07:32.609 --> 01:07:34.708
Then
love me, Rosalind.

01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:36.446
Yes, faith, will I,

01:07:37.781 --> 01:07:40.250
Fridays and Saturdays and all.

01:07:41.217 --> 01:07:42.616
Wilt thou have me?

01:07:42.618 --> 01:07:44.120
Ay, and 20 such.

01:07:46.288 --> 01:07:47.855
What sayest thou?

01:07:47.857 --> 01:07:49.523
Are you not good?

01:07:49.525 --> 01:07:51.125
I hope so.

01:07:51.127 --> 01:07:55.465
Why then, can one desire
too much of a good thing?

01:07:56.965 --> 01:08:01.371
Come, sister, you shall
be the priest and marry us.

01:08:09.578 --> 01:08:11.848
Give me your hand, Orlando.

01:08:17.087 --> 01:08:18.752
What do you say, sister?

01:08:18.755 --> 01:08:20.154
Pray thee marry us.

01:08:20.156 --> 01:08:22.357
I cannot say the words.

01:08:22.359 --> 01:08:24.192
You must begin
will you, Orlando.

01:08:24.194 --> 01:08:25.029
Go to.

01:08:26.763 --> 01:08:30.398
Will you, Orlando, have
to wife this Rosalind?

01:08:30.399 --> 01:08:31.366
I will.

01:08:31.368 --> 01:08:33.000
Ay, but when?

01:08:33.002 --> 01:08:35.301
Why now, as fast
as she can marry us.

01:08:35.304 --> 01:08:39.643
Then you must say I take
thee, Rosalind, for wife.

01:08:44.412 --> 01:08:47.250
I take thee,
Rosalind, for wife.

01:08:49.986 --> 01:08:51.385
I might ask you
for your commission,

01:08:51.386 --> 01:08:55.058
but I do take thee,
Orlando, for my husband.

01:08:58.261 --> 01:09:00.528
But will
my Rosalind do so?

01:09:00.529 --> 01:09:03.367
By my life, she
will do as I do.

01:09:06.268 --> 01:09:09.670
These two hours,
Rosalind, I will leave thee.

01:09:09.671 --> 01:09:12.073
Alas, dear love, I
cannot lack thee two hours.

01:09:12.075 --> 01:09:13.608
I must attend
the duke at dinner.

01:09:13.609 --> 01:09:15.877
By two o'clock I will
be with thee again.

01:09:15.879 --> 01:09:18.649
Ay, go your
ways, go your ways.

01:09:20.917 --> 01:09:22.350
I knew what you would prove.

01:09:22.352 --> 01:09:26.019
My friends told me as much,
and I thought no less.

01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:29.555
That flattering tongue
of yours won me.

01:09:29.558 --> 01:09:33.229
'Tis but one cast away,
and so, come, death.

01:09:35.798 --> 01:09:37.363
Two o'clock is your hour?

01:09:37.366 --> 01:09:39.136
Ay, sweet Rosalind.

01:09:41.170 --> 01:09:43.304
By my troth, and
in good earnest,

01:09:43.305 --> 01:09:45.805
if you break one
jot of your promise

01:09:45.808 --> 01:09:47.573
or come one minute
behind your hour,

01:09:47.576 --> 01:09:51.144
I will think you the most
pathetical break-promise,

01:09:51.145 --> 01:09:53.145
and the most hollow lover,

01:09:53.148 --> 01:09:56.082
and the most unworthy
of her you call Rosalind

01:09:56.084 --> 01:09:59.921
that may be chosen out of the
gross band of the unfaithful.

01:09:59.923 --> 01:10:04.094
Therefore beware my censure
and keep your promise.

01:10:05.628 --> 01:10:06.860
With no less religion

01:10:06.862 --> 01:10:09.896
than if thou wert
indeed my Rosalind.

01:10:09.898 --> 01:10:10.734
So, adieu.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.202
Well, time is the old justice

01:10:14.204 --> 01:10:19.209
that examines all such
offenders, and let time try.

01:10:19.676 --> 01:10:20.076
Adieu.

01:11:03.386 --> 01:11:05.789
Is it not past two o'clock?

01:11:15.999 --> 01:11:17.835
And here much Orlando.

01:11:19.067 --> 01:11:21.635
I warrant you, with pure
love and troubled brain

01:11:21.637 --> 01:11:26.609
he hath ta'en his bow and arrows
and is gone forth to sleep.

01:11:34.683 --> 01:11:36.716
My errand is to
you, fair youth.

01:11:36.718 --> 01:11:40.086
My gentle Phoebe did
bid me give you this.

01:11:40.088 --> 01:11:41.454
I know not the contents,

01:11:41.456 --> 01:11:42.924
but as I guess by the stern brow

01:11:42.926 --> 01:11:44.524
and waspish action
which she did use

01:11:44.526 --> 01:11:48.296
as she was writing of it,
it bears an angry tenor.

01:11:48.298 --> 01:11:49.462
Pardon me.

01:11:49.464 --> 01:11:52.699
I am but as a
guiltless messenger.

01:11:52.701 --> 01:11:54.534
Patience herself would
startle at this letter

01:11:54.536 --> 01:11:56.903
and play the swaggerer.

01:11:56.905 --> 01:11:59.407
Bear this, bear all.

01:11:59.409 --> 01:12:03.109
She says I am not fair,
that I lack manners.

01:12:03.111 --> 01:12:06.113
She calls me proud, and
that she could not love me

01:12:06.115 --> 01:12:09.283
were man as rare as phoenix.

01:12:09.285 --> 01:12:11.752
'Od's my will, her love is
not the hare that I do hunt.

01:12:11.754 --> 01:12:13.820
Why writes she so to me?

01:12:13.822 --> 01:12:16.756
'Tis a boisterous
and a cruel style.

01:12:16.758 --> 01:12:18.426
Will you hear the letter?

01:12:18.428 --> 01:12:20.528
So please you, for
I never heard it yet,

01:12:20.530 --> 01:12:23.930
yet heard too much
of Phoebe's cruelty.

01:12:23.932 --> 01:12:25.733
Mark how the tyrant writes.

01:12:25.735 --> 01:12:27.868
"Art thou god to
shepherd turned,

01:12:27.870 --> 01:12:30.537
"that a maiden's
heart hath burned?

01:12:30.539 --> 01:12:32.607
"If the scorn of your
bright eyne have power

01:12:32.609 --> 01:12:34.708
"to raise such love
in mine, alack,

01:12:34.710 --> 01:12:38.412
"in me what strange effect
would they work in mild aspect?"

01:12:38.414 --> 01:12:40.314
Did you ever hear such railing?

01:12:40.316 --> 01:12:41.948
Call you this railing?

01:12:41.950 --> 01:12:44.085
Alas, poor shepherd.

01:12:44.087 --> 01:12:45.653
Do you pity him?

01:12:45.655 --> 01:12:47.657
No, he deserves no pity.

01:12:49.292 --> 01:12:51.628
Wilt thou love such a woman?

01:12:53.195 --> 01:12:54.929
Well, go your way to her,

01:12:54.931 --> 01:12:58.399
for I see love hath
made thee a tame snake,

01:12:58.401 --> 01:13:00.801
and say this to her:
that if she love me,

01:13:00.803 --> 01:13:34.520
I charge her to love
thee; if she will not,

01:13:34.522 --> 01:13:37.725
I will never have her
unless thou entreat for her.

01:13:39.361 --> 01:13:43.063
If you be a true lover,
hence, and not a word,

01:13:43.065 --> 01:13:45.402
for here comes more company.

01:13:53.875 --> 01:13:56.710
Good morrow, fair ones.

01:13:56.712 --> 01:13:58.077
If that an eye may
profit by a tongue,

01:13:58.079 --> 01:14:00.713
then should I know
you by description,

01:14:00.715 --> 01:14:03.917
such garments, and such years.

01:14:03.919 --> 01:14:06.019
"The boy is fair,
of female favor,

01:14:06.021 --> 01:14:09.189
"and bestows himself
like a ripe sister;

01:14:09.191 --> 01:14:13.327
"the woman low and
browner than her brother."

01:14:13.329 --> 01:14:14.827
Orlando doth commend
him to you both,

01:14:14.829 --> 01:14:18.100
and to that youth he
calls his Rosalind

01:14:19.936 --> 01:14:22.272
he sends this bloody napkin.

01:14:23.838 --> 01:14:24.740
Are you he?

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:26.676
I am.

01:14:28.576 --> 01:14:31.248
What must we understand by this?

01:14:33.182 --> 01:14:36.686
Some of my shame,
if you will know of me

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:41.255
what man I am, and how, and why,

01:14:41.257 --> 01:14:43.991
and where this
handkercher was stained.

01:14:43.993 --> 01:14:45.829
I pray you, tell it.

01:14:48.763 --> 01:14:51.564
When last the young
Orlando parted from you

01:14:51.566 --> 01:14:55.536
he left a promise to return
again within an hour,

01:14:55.538 --> 01:14:57.070
and pacing through the forest,

01:14:57.072 --> 01:15:01.610
chewing the food of sweet and
bitter fancy, lo, what befell.

01:15:02.678 --> 01:15:05.115
Now, sir, what make you here?

01:15:14.789 --> 01:15:18.091
It was his brother,
his elder brother.

01:15:18.093 --> 01:15:20.159
A most wicked Sir Oliver.

01:15:20.161 --> 01:15:25.168
O, I have heard
him speak of that same brother,

01:15:26.201 --> 01:15:27.368
and he did render him

01:15:27.370 --> 01:15:30.804
the most unnatural
that lived amongst men.

01:15:30.806 --> 01:15:32.038
And
well he might so do

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:35.141
for well I know
he was unnatural.

01:15:35.143 --> 01:15:36.609
Are you his brother?

01:15:36.611 --> 01:15:39.012
Was't you that did so
oft contrive to kill him?

01:15:39.014 --> 01:15:41.183
'Twas I, but 'tis not I.

01:15:42.985 --> 01:15:44.518
I do not shame to
tell you what I was,

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:49.159
since my conversion so sweetly
tastes, being the thing I am.

01:16:01.169 --> 01:16:04.074
For
the bloody napkin?

01:16:05.907 --> 01:16:09.475
The gilded snake had
torn some flesh away,

01:16:09.477 --> 01:16:12.479
and after some small space,
being strong at heart,

01:16:12.481 --> 01:16:17.487
he sent me hither, stranger
as I am, to tell this story,

01:16:18.654 --> 01:16:21.521
that you might excuse
his broken promise,

01:16:21.523 --> 01:16:23.489
and to give this napkin
dyed in his blood

01:16:23.491 --> 01:16:24.690
unto the shepherd youth

01:16:24.692 --> 01:16:27.663
that he in sport doth
call his Rosalind.

01:16:29.531 --> 01:16:32.265
Why, how now,
Ganymede, sweet Ganymede.

01:16:32.267 --> 01:16:33.934
Many will swoon when
they do look on blood.

01:16:33.936 --> 01:16:35.135
There is more in it.

01:16:35.137 --> 01:16:36.473
Cousin Ganymede.

01:16:37.338 --> 01:16:39.172
Look, he recovers.

01:16:39.174 --> 01:16:42.745
I pray you, will you
take him by the arm?

01:17:17.579 --> 01:17:20.079
Be of good cheer, youth.

01:17:20.081 --> 01:17:20.917
You a man?

01:17:21.917 --> 01:17:23.617
You lack a man's heart.

01:17:23.619 --> 01:17:25.621
I do so, I confess it.

01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:33.328
Ah, sirrah, a body would think
this was wellcounterfeited.

01:17:34.730 --> 01:17:38.832
I pray you, tell your brother
how well I counterfeited.

01:17:38.834 --> 01:17:39.669
Heigh-ho.

01:17:42.137 --> 01:17:44.904
This was not counterfeit.

01:17:44.906 --> 01:17:46.573
There is too great
testimony in your complexion

01:17:46.575 --> 01:17:49.810
that it was a
passion of earnest.

01:17:49.812 --> 01:17:52.148
Counterfeit, I assure you.

01:17:56.285 --> 01:18:01.291
Well then, take a good heart
and counterfeit to be a man.

01:18:02.023 --> 01:18:03.793
So I do; but i' faith,

01:18:05.527 --> 01:18:08.761
I should have been
a woman by right.

01:18:21.343 --> 01:18:24.110
We shall find a time, Audrey.

01:18:24.112 --> 01:18:26.813
Patience, gentle Audrey.

01:18:26.815 --> 01:18:29.550
But, Audrey, there is a youth

01:18:29.552 --> 01:18:31.818
here in the forest
lays claim to you.

01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:33.186
Ay, I know who 'tis.

01:18:33.188 --> 01:18:36.890
He hath no interest
in me in the world.

01:18:36.892 --> 01:18:38.958
Here's the man you mean.

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:43.130
It is meat and drink
to me to see a clown.

01:18:43.132 --> 01:18:47.434
By my troth, we that have good
wits have much to answer for.

01:18:47.436 --> 01:18:48.467
We shall be flouting.

01:18:48.469 --> 01:18:49.869
We cannot hold.

01:18:49.871 --> 01:18:51.070
Good ev'n, Audrey.

01:18:51.072 --> 01:18:53.073
God gi' good ev'n, William.

01:18:53.075 --> 01:18:54.975
And good ev'n to you, sir.

01:18:54.977 --> 01:18:56.842
Good ev'n, gentle friend.

01:18:56.844 --> 01:18:58.679
Cover thy head, cover thy head.

01:18:58.681 --> 01:19:00.782
Nay, prithee, be covered.

01:19:01.816 --> 01:19:03.082
How old are you, friend?

01:19:03.084 --> 01:19:05.051
Five and 20 sir.

01:19:05.053 --> 01:19:06.121
A ripe age.

01:19:07.455 --> 01:19:08.588
Is thy name William?

01:19:08.590 --> 01:19:09.957
William, sir.

01:19:09.959 --> 01:19:11.190
A fair name.

01:19:11.192 --> 01:19:12.725
Wast born in th' forest here?

01:19:12.727 --> 01:19:16.965
Ay, sir, I thank
God.

01:19:18.534 --> 01:19:20.100
"Thank God."

01:19:20.102 --> 01:19:21.702
Good answer.

01:19:21.704 --> 01:19:23.103
Art rich?

01:19:23.105 --> 01:19:25.605
'Faith, sir, so-so.

01:19:25.607 --> 01:19:30.543
"So-so" is good, very
good, very excellent good.

01:19:30.545 --> 01:19:33.449
And yet it is not:
it is but so-so.

01:19:35.217 --> 01:19:36.449
Art thou wise?

01:19:36.451 --> 01:19:40.487
Ay, sir, I have a
pretty wit.

01:19:40.489 --> 01:19:42.491
Why, thou sayest well.

01:19:43.359 --> 01:19:45.292
I do now remember a saying:

01:19:45.294 --> 01:19:47.661
The fool doth think he is wise,

01:19:47.663 --> 01:19:51.465
but the wise man knows
himself to be a fool.

01:19:51.467 --> 01:19:52.698
You do love this maid?

01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:53.634
I do, sir.

01:19:53.636 --> 01:19:54.734
Art thou learned?

01:19:54.736 --> 01:19:56.269
No, sir.

01:19:56.271 --> 01:20:00.008
- Then learn this of
me: to have, is to have.

01:20:02.745 --> 01:20:05.479
For it is a figure in
rhetoric that drink,

01:20:05.481 --> 01:20:07.648
being poured out of
a cup into a glass,

01:20:07.650 --> 01:20:10.954
by filling the one
doth empty the other.

01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:15.354
For all your writers do
consent that ipse is he.

01:20:15.356 --> 01:20:18.292
Now, you are not
ipse, for I am he.

01:20:18.294 --> 01:20:19.626
Which he, sir?

01:20:19.628 --> 01:20:22.799
He, sir, that must
marry this woman.

01:20:25.267 --> 01:20:30.106
Therefore, you clown, abandon
which is in the vulgar leave

01:20:31.307 --> 01:20:34.440
the society which in
the boorish is company

01:20:34.442 --> 01:20:38.114
of this female which
in the common is woman;

01:20:40.115 --> 01:20:43.850
which together is, abandon
the society of this female,

01:20:43.852 --> 01:20:46.853
or, clown, thou perishest;

01:20:46.855 --> 01:20:50.090
or, to thy better
understanding, diest;

01:20:50.092 --> 01:20:52.693
or, to wit, I kill thee,

01:20:52.695 --> 01:20:55.862
make thee away, translate
thy life into death,

01:20:55.864 --> 01:20:57.933
thy liberty into bondage.

01:21:00.535 --> 01:21:03.202
I will deal in poison with thee,

01:21:03.204 --> 01:21:06.105
or in bastinado, or in steel.

01:21:06.107 --> 01:21:08.475
I will bandy with
thee in faction.

01:21:08.477 --> 01:21:10.609
I will overrun thee with policy.

01:21:10.611 --> 01:21:12.781
I will kill thee 150 ways.

01:21:14.148 --> 01:21:16.850
Therefore tremble and depart.

01:21:16.852 --> 01:21:19.252
Do, good William.

01:21:19.254 --> 01:21:21.424
God rest you merry, sir.

01:21:29.964 --> 01:21:31.331
Is't possible that on
so little acquaintance

01:21:31.333 --> 01:21:33.500
you should like her?

01:21:33.502 --> 01:21:35.902
That but seeing you
should love her?

01:21:35.904 --> 01:21:37.104
And loving woo?

01:21:37.106 --> 01:21:39.238
And, wooing, she should grant?

01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:42.408
And will you persever
to enjoy her?

01:21:42.410 --> 01:21:44.778
Neither call the
giddiness of it in question,

01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:47.381
the poverty of her,
the small acquaintance,

01:21:47.383 --> 01:21:50.583
my sudden wooing, nor
her sudden consenting,

01:21:50.585 --> 01:21:53.056
but say with me I love Aliena;

01:21:56.057 --> 01:21:58.627
say with her that she loves me;

01:22:00.228 --> 01:22:03.195
consent with both that
we may enjoy each other.

01:22:03.197 --> 01:22:05.599
It shall be to your good,
for my father's house

01:22:05.601 --> 01:22:07.934
and all the revenue that
was old Sir Rowland's

01:22:07.936 --> 01:22:09.806
will I estate upon you,

01:22:10.972 --> 01:22:13.575
and here live and
die a shepherd.

01:22:17.745 --> 01:22:19.512
Let your wedding be tomorrow.

01:22:19.514 --> 01:22:20.613
Thither will I invite the Duke

01:22:20.615 --> 01:22:23.483
and all's contented followers.

01:22:23.485 --> 01:22:24.717
Go you and prepare Aliena,

01:22:24.719 --> 01:22:27.490
for, look you, here
comes my Rosalind.

01:22:34.429 --> 01:22:36.762
God save you, brother.

01:22:36.764 --> 01:22:38.700
And you, fair sister.

01:22:47.709 --> 01:22:51.310
O my dear Orlando,
how it grieves me

01:22:51.312 --> 01:22:54.484
to see thee wear thy
heart in a scarf.

01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:56.985
It is my arm.

01:22:58.687 --> 01:23:01.086
I thought thy heart
had been wounded.

01:23:01.088 --> 01:23:04.459
Wounded it is, with
the eyes of a lady.

01:23:08.262 --> 01:23:10.162
Did your brother tell
you how I counterfeited

01:23:10.164 --> 01:23:12.599
to swoon when he showed
me your handkercher?

01:23:12.601 --> 01:23:14.900
Ay, and greater
wonders than that.

01:23:14.902 --> 01:23:16.769
Nay, 'tis true.

01:23:16.771 --> 01:23:18.337
There was never
any thing so sudden

01:23:18.339 --> 01:23:22.274
but the fight of two rams
and Caesar's thrasonical brag

01:23:22.276 --> 01:23:25.010
of "I came, saw, and overcame."

01:23:25.012 --> 01:23:27.881
For your brother and
my sister no sooner met

01:23:27.883 --> 01:23:32.284
but they looked, no sooner
looked but they loved,

01:23:32.286 --> 01:23:34.421
no sooner loved but they sighed,

01:23:34.423 --> 01:23:38.225
no sooner sighed but they
asked one another the reason,

01:23:38.227 --> 01:23:42.362
no sooner knew the reason
but they sought the remedy.

01:23:42.364 --> 01:23:47.370
They are in the very wrath of
love, and they will together.

01:23:48.102 --> 01:23:49.336
Clubs cannot part them.

01:23:49.338 --> 01:23:51.706
They shall be
married tomorrow.

01:23:53.674 --> 01:23:55.876
But O, how bitter a thing
it is to look into happiness

01:23:55.878 --> 01:23:58.147
through another man's eyes.

01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:00.980
By so much the more
shall I tomorrow

01:24:00.982 --> 01:24:02.616
be at the height
of heart-heaviness

01:24:02.618 --> 01:24:04.184
by how much I shall
think my brother happy

01:24:04.186 --> 01:24:06.589
in having what he wishes for.

01:24:08.089 --> 01:24:10.457
Why then, tomorrow I cannot
serve your turn for Rosalind?

01:24:10.459 --> 01:24:13.329
I can live no
longer by thinking.

01:24:15.329 --> 01:24:19.668
I will weary you then no
longer with idle talking.

01:24:20.936 --> 01:24:25.171
Know of me then, for now
I speak to some purpose,

01:24:25.173 --> 01:24:29.141
that I know you are a
gentleman of good conceit.

01:24:29.143 --> 01:24:31.344
If you do love Rosalind
so near the heart

01:24:31.346 --> 01:24:34.447
as your gesture cries it out,

01:24:34.449 --> 01:24:39.152
when your brother marries
Aliena shall you marry her.

01:24:39.154 --> 01:24:41.854
I know into what straits
of fortune she is driven,

01:24:41.856 --> 01:24:44.056
and it is not impossible to me,

01:24:44.058 --> 01:24:47.128
if it appear not
inconvenient to you,

01:24:48.563 --> 01:24:51.665
to set her before your eyes
tomorrow, human as she is.

01:24:51.667 --> 01:24:53.567
Speak'st thou
in sober meanings?

01:24:53.569 --> 01:24:55.071
By my life I do.

01:24:59.540 --> 01:25:04.547
Therefore, put you in your
best array, bid your friends;

01:25:05.914 --> 01:25:09.215
for if you will be married
tomorrow, you shall,

01:25:09.217 --> 01:25:11.554
and to Rosalind, if you will.

01:25:16.624 --> 01:25:21.062
Look, here comes a lover of
mine and a lover of hers.

01:25:27.369 --> 01:25:29.802
Youth, you have done
me much ungentleness

01:25:29.804 --> 01:25:31.136
to show the letter
that I writ to you.

01:25:31.138 --> 01:25:32.872
I care not if I have.

01:25:32.874 --> 01:25:36.208
It is my study to seem
despiteful and ungentle to you.

01:25:36.210 --> 01:25:38.877
You are there followed
by a faithful shepherd.

01:25:38.879 --> 01:25:42.448
Look upon him, love
him; he worships you.

01:25:42.450 --> 01:25:46.786
Good shepherd, tell this
youth what 'tis to love.

01:25:46.788 --> 01:25:50.023
It is to be all made
of sighs and tears,

01:25:50.025 --> 01:25:51.190
and so am I for Phoebe.

01:25:51.192 --> 01:25:52.225
And I for Ganymede.

01:25:52.227 --> 01:25:53.059
And I for Rosalind.

01:25:53.061 --> 01:25:54.860
And I for no woman.

01:25:54.862 --> 01:25:57.663
It is to be all made
of faith and service,

01:25:57.665 --> 01:25:58.832
and so am I for Phoebe.

01:25:58.834 --> 01:25:59.799
And I for Ganymede.

01:25:59.801 --> 01:26:00.667
And I for Rosalind.

01:26:00.669 --> 01:26:02.469
And I for no woman.

01:26:02.471 --> 01:26:03.769
It is to be all
made of fantasy,

01:26:03.771 --> 01:26:07.342
all made of passion
and all made of wishes,

01:26:08.477 --> 01:26:11.280
all adoration, duty,
and observance,

01:26:13.682 --> 01:26:17.751
all humbleness, all
patience and impatience,

01:26:17.753 --> 01:26:21.090
all purity, all trial
and all obedience.

01:26:22.324 --> 01:26:23.657
And so am I for Phoebe.

01:26:23.659 --> 01:26:25.091
And so am I for Ganymede.

01:26:25.093 --> 01:26:26.359
And so
am I for Rosalind.

01:26:26.361 --> 01:26:28.528
And so
am I for no woman.

01:26:28.530 --> 01:26:30.229
If this be so, why
blame you me to love you?

01:26:30.231 --> 01:26:31.665
If this be so, why
blame you me to love you?

01:26:31.667 --> 01:26:33.099
If this be so, why
blame you me to love you?

01:26:33.101 --> 01:26:34.033
Why
do you speak too,

01:26:34.035 --> 01:26:35.234
why blame you me to love you?

01:26:35.236 --> 01:26:39.372
To her that is not
here, nor doth not hear.

01:26:39.374 --> 01:26:41.174
Pray you, no more of this.

01:26:41.176 --> 01:26:45.679
'Tis like the howling of
Irish wolves against the moon.

01:26:45.681 --> 01:26:48.614
I will help you, if I can.

01:26:48.616 --> 01:26:51.020
I would love you, if I could.

01:26:52.286 --> 01:26:55.121
Tomorrow meet me all together.

01:26:55.123 --> 01:26:57.290
I will marry you, if
ever I marry woman,

01:26:57.292 --> 01:26:59.091
and I'll be married tomorrow.

01:26:59.093 --> 01:27:01.994
I will satisfy you,
if ever I satisfy man,

01:27:01.996 --> 01:27:04.430
and you shall be
married tomorrow.

01:27:04.432 --> 01:27:07.132
I will content you, if what
pleases you contents you,

01:27:07.134 --> 01:27:09.536
and you shall be
married tomorrow.

01:27:09.538 --> 01:27:11.203
As you love Rosalind, meet.

01:27:11.205 --> 01:27:12.706
As you love Phoebe, meet.

01:27:12.708 --> 01:27:15.544
And as I love no
woman, I'll meet.

01:27:17.279 --> 01:27:18.211
So fare you well.

01:27:18.213 --> 01:27:20.380
I have left you commands.

01:27:20.382 --> 01:27:21.780
I'll not fail, if I live.

01:27:21.782 --> 01:27:22.614
Nor I.

01:27:22.616 --> 01:27:23.451
Nor I.

01:27:30.926 --> 01:27:33.292
It is 10:00 o'clock.

01:27:33.294 --> 01:27:36.162
Tomorrow will I be married.

01:27:36.164 --> 01:27:39.101
Thus may we see
how the world wags.

01:27:40.435 --> 01:27:43.269
'Tis but an hour ago
since it was nine,

01:27:43.271 --> 01:27:47.006
and after one hour
more 'twill be 11.

01:27:47.008 --> 01:27:50.679
And so, from hour to
hour, we ripe and ripe,

01:27:52.748 --> 01:27:56.419
and then, from hour to
hour, we rot and rot.

01:28:18.072 --> 01:28:23.079

Here comes a pair a pair
of very strange beasts,

01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:29.509
in which all tongues
are called fools.

01:29:29.511 --> 01:29:32.878
Good my lord, this is the
motleyminded gentleman

01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:35.047
I have so often
met in the forest.

01:29:35.049 --> 01:29:38.217
He hath been a
courtier, he swears.

01:29:38.219 --> 01:29:42.654
If any man doubt that, let
him put me to my purgation.

01:29:42.656 --> 01:29:44.323
I've trod a measure.

01:29:44.325 --> 01:29:46.192
I have flattered a lady.

01:29:46.194 --> 01:29:49.528
I have been politic with my
friend, smooth with mine enemy.

01:29:49.530 --> 01:29:51.096
I have undone three tailors.

01:29:51.098 --> 01:29:55.001
I have had four quarrels, and
I like to have fought one.

01:29:55.003 --> 01:29:57.871
And how
was that ta'en up?

01:29:57.873 --> 01:30:00.006
Faith, we met,

01:30:00.008 --> 01:30:04.079
and found the quarrel was
upon the seventh cause.

01:30:06.248 --> 01:30:08.851
Upon a lie seven times removed.

01:30:10.252 --> 01:30:13.222
Bear your body more
seeming, Audrey.

01:30:14.388 --> 01:30:15.921
As thus, sir.

01:30:15.923 --> 01:30:19.692
I did dislike the cut of a
certain courtier's beard.

01:30:19.694 --> 01:30:22.194
He sent me word if I said
his beard was not cut well,

01:30:22.196 --> 01:30:24.766
he was in the mind that it was.

01:30:25.967 --> 01:30:29.034
This is called the
retort courteous.

01:30:29.036 --> 01:30:32.337
If I sent him word again
it was not well cut,

01:30:32.339 --> 01:30:37.076
he would send me word he cut
it to please himself.

01:30:37.078 --> 01:30:38.711
This is called the quip modest.

01:30:38.713 --> 01:30:43.349
If again it was not well
cut, he disabled my judgment.

01:30:43.351 --> 01:30:46.188
This is called the
reply churlish.

01:30:47.121 --> 01:30:49.655
If again it was not well cut,

01:30:49.657 --> 01:30:52.428
he would answer
I spake not true.

01:30:53.594 --> 01:30:56.595
This is called the
reproof valiant.

01:30:56.597 --> 01:31:00.702
If again it was not well
cut, he would say I lie.

01:31:02.036 --> 01:31:05.340
This is called the
countercheck quarrelsome,

01:31:06.708 --> 01:31:11.045
and so to the lie circumstantial
and the lie direct.

01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:16.349
And how oft did you say
his beard was not well cut?

01:31:16.351 --> 01:31:18.952
I durst go no further
than the lie circumstantial,

01:31:18.954 --> 01:31:21.887
nor he durst not give
me the lie direct;

01:31:21.889 --> 01:31:24.959
and so we measured
swords and parted.

01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:29.628
Is not this a rare
fellow, my lord?

01:31:29.630 --> 01:31:33.533
He's as good at
anything and yet a fool.

01:31:33.535 --> 01:31:35.868
He uses his folly
like a stalkinghorse,

01:31:35.870 --> 01:31:38.938
and under the
presentation of that

01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:40.139
he shoots his wit.

01:31:51.919 --> 01:31:54.319
Then is there mirth in heaven

01:31:54.321 --> 01:31:58.060
when Earthly things made
even atone together.

01:32:00.794 --> 01:32:03.431
Good Duke, receive thy daughter.

01:32:05.734 --> 01:32:09.435
Hymen from heaven brought
her, yea, brought her hither,

01:32:09.437 --> 01:32:13.038
that thou mightst join
her hand with his,

01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:15.710
whose heart within his bosom is.

01:32:19.213 --> 01:32:22.450
To you I give
myself, for I am yours.

01:32:23.551 --> 01:32:26.521
To you I give myself,
for I am yours.

01:32:27.888 --> 01:32:31.890
If there be truth in
sight, you are my daughter.

01:32:31.892 --> 01:32:35.694
If there be truth in
sight, you are my Rosalind.

01:32:35.696 --> 01:32:40.201
If sight and shape be true,
why then, my love adieu.

01:32:41.870 --> 01:32:45.470
I'll have no father,
if you be not he.

01:32:45.472 --> 01:32:49.475
I'll have no husband,
if you be not he.

01:32:49.477 --> 01:32:52.715
Nor ne'er wed woman,
if you be not she.

01:32:55.984 --> 01:33:00.955
'Tis I must make conclusion
of these most strange events.

01:33:02.389 --> 01:33:05.957
Here's eight that must take
hands to join in Hymen's bands,

01:33:05.959 --> 01:33:08.329
if truth holds true contents.

01:33:09.563 --> 01:33:11.866
So is the bargain.

01:33:25.946 --> 01:33:28.784
You and you no
cross shall part.

01:33:39.761 --> 01:33:40.696
You and you

01:33:43.565 --> 01:33:45.167
are heart in heart.

01:33:53.374 --> 01:33:55.611
You to his love must accord

01:33:57.745 --> 01:34:00.149
or have a woman to your lord.

01:34:10.225 --> 01:34:12.561
You and you are sure together

01:34:13.428 --> 01:34:15.898
as the winter to foul weather.

01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:41.753
Let me have audience
for a word or two.

01:34:41.755 --> 01:34:45.824
I bring these tidings
to this fair assembly.

01:34:45.826 --> 01:34:48.394
Frederick Duke, hearing
how that every day men

01:34:48.396 --> 01:34:51.463
of great worth resorted
to this forest,

01:34:51.465 --> 01:34:54.800
addressed a mighty power
purposely to take his brother here

01:34:54.802 --> 01:34:57.170
and put him to the sword.

01:34:57.172 --> 01:35:00.405
And to the skirts of
this wild wood he came,

01:35:00.407 --> 01:35:02.440
where, meeting with
an old religious man,

01:35:02.442 --> 01:35:04.676
after some question with him,

01:35:04.678 --> 01:35:07.979
was converted both from his
enterprise and from the world

01:35:07.981 --> 01:35:11.149
his crown bequeathing
to his banished brother.

01:35:11.151 --> 01:35:14.519
This to be true, I
do engage my life.

01:35:29.204 --> 01:35:32.037
First, in this forest,

01:35:32.039 --> 01:35:34.372
let us do those ends
that here were well begun

01:35:34.374 --> 01:35:36.645
and well begot, and, after,

01:35:38.312 --> 01:35:41.846
every of this happy number
that have endured shrewd days

01:35:41.848 --> 01:35:44.015
and nights with us

01:35:44.017 --> 01:35:47.788
shall share the good of
our returned fortune.

01:35:49.223 --> 01:35:53.192
Meantime, forget this
new-fall'n dignity,

01:35:53.194 --> 01:35:56.494
and fall into our
rustic revelry.

01:35:56.496 --> 01:35:58.163
Play, music.

01:35:58.165 --> 01:36:01.169
And you, brides and
bridegrooms all,

01:36:02.570 --> 01:36:06.308
with measure heaped in
joy, to thy measures fall.

01:36:16.284 --> 01:36:19.018
Sir, by your patience:
if I heard you rightly,

01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:21.953
the Duke hath put
on a religious life

01:36:21.955 --> 01:36:25.024
and thrown into neglect
the pompous court.

01:36:25.026 --> 01:36:25.861
He hath.

01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:29.228
To him will I.

01:36:29.230 --> 01:36:31.430
DUKE, SR.:
Stay, Jaques, stay.

01:36:31.432 --> 01:36:34.233
Your former honor I bequeath.

01:36:34.235 --> 01:36:38.703
Your patience and your
virtue well deserves it.

01:36:38.705 --> 01:36:40.672
To your pleasures.

01:36:40.674 --> 01:36:44.111
I am for other than
for dancing measures.

01:37:20.914 --> 01:37:22.614
We will begin these rites,

01:37:22.616 --> 01:37:26.387
as we do trust they'll
end, in true delights.

01:38:06.893 --> 01:38:09.694
My way is to conjure you.

01:38:09.696 --> 01:38:12.198
And I'll begin with the women.

01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:16.801
I charge you, O women, for
the love you bear to men,

01:38:16.803 --> 01:38:20.171
to like as much of this
play as please you.

01:38:20.173 --> 01:38:24.676
And I charge you, O men, for
the love you bear to women,

01:38:24.678 --> 01:38:26.545
as I perceive by your simpering,

01:38:26.547 --> 01:38:28.413
none of you hates them,

01:38:28.415 --> 01:38:32.687
that between you and the
women the play may please.

01:38:35.856 --> 01:38:38.056
If I were a woman

01:38:38.058 --> 01:38:43.065
I would kiss as many of you
as had beards that pleased me,

01:38:44.464 --> 01:38:48.069
complexions that liked me,
and breaths that I defied not.

01:38:50.004 --> 01:38:52.872
And I am sure as many
as have good beards,

01:38:52.874 --> 01:38:55.477
or good faces, or sweet breaths

01:38:57.245 --> 01:39:03.251
will for my kind offer, when I
make curtsy, bid me farewell.

01:43:34.954 --> 01:43:36.457
Let's cut.

01:43:36.710 --> 01:43:40.524
