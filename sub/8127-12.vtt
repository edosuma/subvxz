Glenn Miller played ¶

We had it made ¶                

00:13.013 --> 00:16.280
    ¶ Those were the days ¶

               <i>¶ And you knew</i>

00:40.874 --> 00:46.678
¶ Those were the days ¶         

00:53.953 --> 00:55.186
        Oh.                     

00:55.188 --> 00:57.022
     [LAUGHS]                   

00:57.024 --> 00:59.423
Oh, that's so funny, Bertha.    

00:59.425 --> 01:02.894
     I'll have to remember      
  to tell that one to Archie.   

01:02.896 --> 01:05.864
     He always likes jokes      
      that end up funnier       

01:05.866 --> 01:09.500
than when they start out.       

01:09.502 --> 01:12.370
    No, I had nothing           
        special to say.         

01:12.372 --> 01:14.605
    It's just it's so lonely    
          around here           

01:14.607 --> 01:17.075
 since Gloria started working.  

01:17.077 --> 01:19.878
    If it wasn't for the TV     
    in the afternoon,           

01:19.880 --> 01:23.815
    there'd be nobody           
    to talk to at all.          

01:23.817 --> 01:26.517
     Oh, I hear him coming.     
I got to hang up, Bertha. Yeah. 

01:26.519 --> 01:28.319
Bye.                            

01:28.321 --> 01:32.090
Oh, hello, Archie.              

01:32.092 --> 01:33.491
How was your day?               

01:33.493 --> 01:37.428
            Lousy, Edith, lousy.

01:37.430 --> 01:40.131
 The world out there            
 is full of nuts and fruitcakes,

01:40.133 --> 01:42.500
      and sometimes I think     
      I'm gonna go the same way.

01:42.502 --> 01:44.402
Oh, no.                         
         Oh, be prepared, Edith.

01:44.404 --> 01:45.870
                If I got to ride
                them subways    

01:45.872 --> 01:47.038
              another two years,

01:47.040 --> 01:48.506
                you're gonna    
                have to check me

01:48.508 --> 01:49.841
             into a rubber room.

01:49.843 --> 01:51.910
Oh, ain't that funny? Bertha--  
             I was coming home--

01:51.912 --> 01:55.714
             I'm talking, Edith.

01:55.716 --> 01:58.683
    I'm coming home tonight     
    and it's sardine time again.

01:58.685 --> 02:01.152
         Here's a guy pressed   
         up against me so close,

02:01.154 --> 02:04.222
his buttons are making permanent
dents in my flesh, see?         

02:04.224 --> 02:05.389
                So there we are.

02:05.391 --> 02:06.691
      We're riding nose to nose,

02:06.693 --> 02:08.459
        and he starts           
        talking to his daughter.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.261
Well, what's the matter         
with that?                      

02:10.263 --> 02:12.597
        She wasn't there, Edith.

02:16.135 --> 02:17.368
            Then on top of that,

02:17.370 --> 02:20.805
            the bum behind me   
            had beans for lunch.

02:27.213 --> 02:29.114
How did you know that?          

02:35.755 --> 02:39.724
     I could tell               
     by the way he smiled at me.

02:39.726 --> 02:40.792
              Oh.               

02:40.794 --> 02:43.461
Why ain't supper                
on the table here, huh?         

02:43.463 --> 02:45.630
              Well, can you wait
              a little while?   

02:45.632 --> 02:47.531
            Gloria ain't home   
            from work yet.      

02:47.533 --> 02:49.134
Aw, jeez,                       
there's another one             

02:49.136 --> 02:50.769
that lost                       
her nuts and bolts.             

02:50.771 --> 02:53.204
It's bad enough                 
she's married to the meathead.  

02:53.206 --> 02:56.507
Now she's got to go working     
his way through school.         

02:56.509 --> 02:59.010
Edith, where's the aspirin?     
I have a head coming on.        

02:59.012 --> 03:00.311
                  It's upstairs.

03:00.313 --> 03:03.148
Why is it always upstairs       
when I'm downstairs             

03:03.150 --> 03:04.382
and downstairs                  
when I'm upstairs?              

03:04.384 --> 03:06.017
Can't you never organize        
nothing, Edith, huh?            

03:06.019 --> 03:07.318
                    Oh, well,   
                    I'll get it.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.453
No, no, no, don't bother.       
I'll get the aspirin.           

03:09.455 --> 03:11.422
Get supper                      
on the table, huh?              

03:11.424 --> 03:13.825
    Jeez, one of these days     
 I'm gonna come home from work  

03:13.827 --> 03:15.626
    and I'm gonna reach out     
          my two hands          

03:15.628 --> 03:17.628
    to get the things           
     that I need and I want     

03:17.630 --> 03:18.696
and I'm gonna find them...      

03:20.532 --> 03:22.767
Oh, hello,                      
Gloria.                         

03:22.769 --> 03:24.869
How was your day                
at work?                        

03:24.871 --> 03:26.404
                      Lousy, Ma.

03:26.406 --> 03:27.772
                I'm telling you,

03:27.774 --> 03:29.340
        it's a city full        
        of weirdos out there.

To begin with,                  

03:39.319 --> 03:41.119
it was sales day                
at the store.                   

03:41.121 --> 03:42.320
Do you have any idea            

03:42.322 --> 03:45.290
what 50% off does               
to nice, normal women?          

03:45.292 --> 03:47.725
It turns them                   
into raving lunatics.           

03:47.727 --> 03:49.393
Did you ever see                
a size 18 fatso                 

03:49.395 --> 03:51.129
trying to zip herself           
into a size 10?                 

03:53.365 --> 03:54.632
            No, but I remember--

03:54.634 --> 03:58.669
Ma! I'm talking, Ma.            

03:58.671 --> 04:00.538
Now, if that wasn't bad enough, 

04:00.540 --> 04:03.474
coming home on the bus          
I felt like a sardine in a can. 

04:03.476 --> 04:04.642
  And lucky me,                 

04:04.644 --> 04:06.978
I got to be standing            
right next to a groper.         

04:06.980 --> 04:11.782
He made me feel like            
a fresh loaf of Wonder Bread.   

04:11.784 --> 04:14.052
                     Oh, my.    
I tell you,                     

04:14.054 --> 04:16.221
the only good thing             
about getting on a bus nowadays 

04:16.223 --> 04:17.788
is knowing                      
that you're getting off again.  

04:17.790 --> 04:20.091
    Hold it, hold it there,     
          little girl.          

04:20.093 --> 04:21.159
                 I could hear   
                 them complaints

04:21.161 --> 04:22.727
                  all the way up
                  in the toilet.

04:22.729 --> 04:25.663
  Listen, you ain't been working
  long enough to know,          

04:25.665 --> 04:27.899
          but when you come home
          at the end of the day,

04:27.901 --> 04:31.369
 you're supposed to leave       
 your troubles outside the door.

04:33.438 --> 04:35.773
    You come in with            
    a cheerful word and a smile.

04:35.775 --> 04:37.175
            Don't be bringing   
            your burdens in here

04:37.177 --> 04:38.709
and dumping them on your mother.

04:38.711 --> 04:41.112
      Will you get supper       
         on the table?          

04:42.948 --> 04:45.049
            Mike ain't home yet.

04:45.051 --> 04:46.217
Oh, good.                       

04:46.219 --> 04:47.385
Maybe we'll get a chance        

04:47.387 --> 04:50.788
to look at the food now         
before it disappears.           

04:50.790 --> 04:53.124
In the meantime, can you        
bring me a beer over here?      

04:53.126 --> 04:54.125
            Oh, sure, Archie.   

04:54.127 --> 04:56.027
Ma, why isn't                   
Michael home yet?               

04:56.029 --> 04:57.495
Did he say                      
he'd be late?                   

04:57.497 --> 04:59.197
        No, I don't think so.   

04:59.199 --> 05:01.366
     He better not be late,     
     because after supper,      

05:01.368 --> 05:03.834
    he's got to help me move    
  that refrigerator out there.  

05:03.836 --> 05:06.037
      I got to fix a pipe       
that's leaking behind it.       

05:07.439 --> 05:08.439
GLORIA:                         
Hi, Michael.                    

05:08.441 --> 05:09.440
              Hi.               

05:09.442 --> 05:10.441
How was your day?               

05:10.443 --> 05:11.309
                          Lousy.

05:13.812 --> 05:14.812
                     Ah!        

05:14.814 --> 05:15.813
What's the matter?              

05:15.815 --> 05:17.815
                Ah! No, nothing.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.550
              It's just a little
              bit of a twinge.  

05:19.552 --> 05:21.185
It's your side                  
again, isn't it?                

05:21.187 --> 05:22.686
It's that dumb appendix.        

05:22.688 --> 05:24.522
Yeah. That's why I'm late.      

05:24.524 --> 05:26.524
     I've just been to see      
      Dr. Nelson about it.      

05:26.526 --> 05:27.959
         Oh, hi, Mike.          

05:27.961 --> 05:29.928
Here's your beer, Archie.       

05:29.930 --> 05:31.062
                Leave it        
                there, Edith.   

05:31.064 --> 05:32.297
Michael, I told you             
months ago                      

05:32.299 --> 05:34.032
you should have that            
taken care of.                  

05:34.034 --> 05:35.300
 Well, Gloria, Dr. Nelson said  

05:35.302 --> 05:36.600
      it's just a typical       
      grumbling appendix.       

05:36.602 --> 05:38.102
     There's no emergency.      

05:38.104 --> 05:40.004
    Yeah, but it could          
     flare up at any time.      

05:40.006 --> 05:42.373
      But he said I could       
have it out whenever I'm ready. 

05:42.375 --> 05:44.675
Michael, I think                
you're ready.                   

05:44.677 --> 05:47.545
         Yeah. I just don't like
         the idea of being cut. 

05:47.547 --> 05:50.048
Oh, nowadays,                   
taking out your appendix        

05:50.050 --> 05:52.283
is a simple,                    
routine operation.              

05:52.285 --> 05:54.052
         Oh, maybe not.         

05:54.054 --> 05:55.286
Them doctors open him up,       

05:55.288 --> 05:56.454
they might find themselves      

05:56.456 --> 05:58.423
         rooting around         
      in a bottomless pit.      

06:05.264 --> 06:06.897
      What is it with you?      

06:06.899 --> 06:09.033
Don't you take anything serious?

06:09.035 --> 06:11.970
    Don't you see they want     
    to cut out my appendix?     

06:11.972 --> 06:14.305
        Ah, face up to it       
        like a man, will you?   

06:14.307 --> 06:15.739
                Jeez, I had     
                an operation.   

06:15.741 --> 06:17.342
            Nobody heard me     
            hollering around.   

06:17.344 --> 06:18.343
                Right, Edith?   

06:18.345 --> 06:20.478
Oh, no, no, Archie.             

06:20.480 --> 06:22.347
You fainted.                    

06:24.483 --> 06:26.484
                  Who asked you?

06:26.486 --> 06:28.252
                I don't need    
                an operation.   

06:28.254 --> 06:30.488
          I mean, I can continue
          with the ice pack.    

06:30.490 --> 06:31.856
                Why rush into   
                these things?   

06:31.858 --> 06:34.225
But, Michael, if it's gotta go, 
it's gotta go.                  

06:34.227 --> 06:36.394
Why hang on to something        
that's useless?                 

06:36.396 --> 06:39.497
That's what I've been asking you
  ever since you married him.   

06:41.133 --> 06:44.302
    Maybe the appendix          
         ain't useless.         

06:44.304 --> 06:48.272
     Maybe God put it there     
 for doctors to practice up on  

06:48.274 --> 06:50.508
  for more serious operations.  

06:54.346 --> 06:57.348
                  You're a pip, 
                  you know that?

06:57.350 --> 06:59.150
        Well, nobody's going    
        to practice up on me.   

06:59.152 --> 07:00.951
         I mean, when I decide  
         to have this operation,

07:00.953 --> 07:02.220
                  I'm gonna     
                  have the best.

07:02.222 --> 07:03.888
    Dr. Nelson recommended      
    the best surgeon he knew.   

07:03.890 --> 07:05.323
         He called Dr. McKenzie.

07:05.325 --> 07:07.191
        Well, you know who I    
        think we should call?   

07:07.193 --> 07:08.192
Who?                            

07:08.194 --> 07:09.593
         Chicken Delight, Edith,

07:09.595 --> 07:13.297
      because we ain't gonna get
      no supper out of you.     

07:13.299 --> 07:15.333
    I'll help you, Ma.          

07:15.335 --> 07:16.600
Michael, I think you should have

07:16.602 --> 07:18.736
         that appendix          
taken care of right away.       

07:18.738 --> 07:20.204
Gloria, I'm not ready yet.      

07:20.206 --> 07:22.240
Besides, where's the money      
coming from to pay for it?      

07:22.242 --> 07:23.807
      Our savings account.      

07:23.809 --> 07:25.476
        Oh, no, no, no.         
    That's your money.          

07:25.478 --> 07:26.477
        That's not mine.        

07:26.479 --> 07:28.513
Michael, that's our money.      

07:28.515 --> 07:30.548
    We each contribute          
        in our own way.         

07:30.550 --> 07:32.083
         That's right.          

07:32.085 --> 07:35.653
    You contribute deposits.    
  He contributes withdrawals.   

07:35.655 --> 07:39.690
      Daddy, our marriage       
    is an equal partnership.    

07:39.692 --> 07:41.359
      We share everything.      

07:41.361 --> 07:42.893
 Well, tell your equal partner  

07:42.895 --> 07:45.396
 he's gonna share some work     
 with me tonight after supper.  

07:45.398 --> 07:46.864
 Gonna move that refrigerator.  

07:46.866 --> 07:48.266
            Michael,            
    don't you move anything,    

07:48.268 --> 07:49.767
          not the way           
    you're feeling tonight.     

07:49.769 --> 07:51.569
Don't be getting him            
out of work, will you?          

07:51.571 --> 07:52.970
He gets out of enough           
work himself.                   

07:52.972 --> 07:54.038
                All right, Arch.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.306
            You want to move    
            the refrigerator?   

07:55.308 --> 07:56.807
                Come on.        
                We'll do it now.

07:56.809 --> 07:57.975
                        Ah!     

07:57.977 --> 08:00.278
                     Ah, ah,    
                     no, no, no.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.547
        Ah, jeez,               
what's this supposed to be now? 

08:02.549 --> 08:06.117
                    It's a pain.

08:06.119 --> 08:08.286
         I got a-- I got a sharp
         pain right here.       

08:08.288 --> 08:11.055
  You're giving me a dull pain  
          right there.          

08:11.057 --> 08:12.457
             Ah, leave me alone,
             will you, Arch?    

08:12.459 --> 08:13.458
                         Gloria!

08:13.460 --> 08:14.459
             Yeah?              

08:14.461 --> 08:16.060
        Will you get me         
      an ice pack, please?      

08:16.062 --> 08:18.262
Oh, is it worse?                
            Yeah, it's worse.   

08:18.264 --> 08:21.132
Oh, gee, maybe I'll have to have
that operation after all.       

08:21.134 --> 08:23.134
        I don't know how        
we're gonna pay for it.         

08:23.136 --> 08:25.936
        Soup's on!              

08:25.938 --> 08:28.005
  Good. It's about time, too.   

08:28.007 --> 08:29.974
    Jeez, we're all starving    
        over here.              

08:29.976 --> 08:31.476
What kind of soup you got,      
             Edith?             

08:31.478 --> 08:33.844
Oh, we're not                   
having soup, Archie.            

08:33.846 --> 08:37.948
      Well, what the hell       
are you yelling "Soup's on" for?

08:37.950 --> 08:40.017
It's just an expression.        

08:40.019 --> 08:41.586
It means dinner's ready.        

08:41.587 --> 08:44.222
 Well, why can't you just say,  
    "Dinner's ready"?           

08:44.224 --> 08:46.224
All right.                      
Dinner's ready!                 

08:46.226 --> 08:48.159
                        Ah, no. 
                        Not now.

08:49.595 --> 08:51.829
     Here you are, Michael.     
     Here's your ice pack.      

08:51.831 --> 08:53.431
          You'd better          
      take off your pants.      

08:53.433 --> 08:55.299
            Hold it! Hold it!   

08:55.301 --> 08:57.935
No pants off in the living room.
            MICHAEL: Why not?   

08:57.937 --> 08:59.337
Mixed company here.             

08:59.339 --> 09:00.838
 Mixed company?                 

09:00.840 --> 09:03.407
Your mother don't want to see   
him standing in his drawers.    

09:03.409 --> 09:05.510
                  Arch, it's for
                  my side.      

09:05.512 --> 09:06.611
Yeah, your side, your side.     

09:06.613 --> 09:08.646
It's for your lower side,       

09:08.648 --> 09:10.881
which ain't supposed to be seen 
  except behind bedroom doors.  

09:10.883 --> 09:12.216
    Now get upstairs.           

09:12.218 --> 09:15.419
Daddy, Michael can't walk       
upstairs with this pain.        

09:15.421 --> 09:17.321
Oh, boy, you know               
something, Daddy?               

09:17.323 --> 09:18.856
You're really a prude.          

09:18.858 --> 09:20.258
          I'm a prude?          

09:20.260 --> 09:22.260
     How would you like it      
     if I dropped my pants      

09:22.262 --> 09:24.061
      every time I wanted       
    to put an ice pack          

09:24.063 --> 09:25.496
  up against my private parts?  

09:29.668 --> 09:32.537
     Archie, I ain't never      
    seen you do that.           

09:34.773 --> 09:37.808
        That is because         
    I never do that, Edith.     

09:37.810 --> 09:39.109
              Oh.               

09:39.111 --> 09:41.045
All done. You can               
look now, Daddy.                

09:41.047 --> 09:43.381
          Who the hell          
     wants to look at that?     

09:43.383 --> 09:45.650
    Mike, here's some water,    

09:45.652 --> 09:47.285
and I'll bring your plate.      

09:47.287 --> 09:49.420
You don't have                  
to sit up at the table.         

09:49.422 --> 09:50.555
                  Oh, that's    
                  all right, Ma.

09:50.557 --> 09:51.755
            I don't feel like   
            eating, anyway.     

09:51.757 --> 09:53.157
    Hold it, hold it.           

09:53.159 --> 09:55.359
      What's this I hear?       
He don't feel like eating?      

09:55.361 --> 09:58.062
      You're gonna have me      
  believing he's really sick.   

09:58.064 --> 10:00.731
 What is it with you, Meathead? 
      You really feel bad?      

10:00.733 --> 10:03.267
    Yeah, that's what           
 I've been trying to tell you.  

10:03.269 --> 10:04.268
        I feel terrible.        

10:04.270 --> 10:05.969
              Oh.               

10:05.971 --> 10:08.138
        Oh, jeez.               

10:08.140 --> 10:09.273
            Well...             

10:09.275 --> 10:10.408
         I better eat.          

10:13.478 --> 10:14.612
Michael, I think                

10:14.614 --> 10:16.614
you should have                 
that operation soon.            

10:16.616 --> 10:17.948
             Gloria, do you know

10:17.950 --> 10:19.250
        how much Dr. McKenzie   
        charges?                

10:19.252 --> 10:22.320
                    350 dollars.

10:22.322 --> 10:25.189
          350 dollars?          

10:25.191 --> 10:26.657
For one appendix?               

10:26.659 --> 10:29.960
 Certainly. All them surgeons,  
    they're highway robbers.    

10:29.962 --> 10:34.365
Why do you think they wear masks
    when they operate?          

10:37.636 --> 10:38.936
                  GLORIA:       
                  Wait a minute.

10:38.938 --> 10:40.304
         Wait a minute.         

10:40.306 --> 10:42.673
 Why don't we ask Audrey Stern  
      to do the operation?      

10:42.675 --> 10:44.208
         Audrey Stern?          

10:44.210 --> 10:46.009
Remember?                       
She worked with us              

10:46.011 --> 10:47.645
on the Youth Vote               
Registration campaign.          

10:47.647 --> 10:48.646
Dr. Audrey Stern?               

10:48.648 --> 10:50.114
                    Oh, yeah.   

10:50.116 --> 10:53.384
She did Mary Goodwin's appendix 
     for only 150 dollars.      

10:53.386 --> 10:54.818
 Why don't I call her tonight?  

10:54.820 --> 10:56.754
Well, I-- I don't know, Gloria. 

10:56.756 --> 10:59.490
I mean, Dr. Nelson already      
has me set up with Dr. McKenzie.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.858
It doesn't sound ethical.       

11:00.860 --> 11:02.326
    It sounds cheaper.          

11:02.328 --> 11:04.629
    It sounds stupid.           

11:04.631 --> 11:05.796
What do you mean, stupid?       

11:05.798 --> 11:07.331
            I mean, little girl,

11:07.333 --> 11:08.966
             that I wouldn't let
             no doctor          

11:08.968 --> 11:12.570
        by the name of Audrey   
        fool around with me.    

11:12.572 --> 11:14.037
              You take my advice
              there, Meathead.  

11:14.039 --> 11:15.573
             You stick to a man.

11:15.575 --> 11:17.040
                You get yourself
                an older guy    

11:17.042 --> 11:19.243
                with experience,
                like McKenzie.  

11:19.245 --> 11:22.012
        Daddy, how do you know  
        how old Dr. McKenzie is?

11:22.014 --> 11:23.414
                  You never even
                  heard of him  

11:23.416 --> 11:24.915
          till five minutes ago.

11:24.917 --> 11:26.717
Well, I know Dr. Nelson.        

11:26.719 --> 11:27.918
    I know he wouldn't          
    recommend nobody            

11:27.920 --> 11:29.320
    who didn't have savvy.      

11:29.322 --> 11:31.989
        So you're saying        
  you'd rather be operated on   

11:31.991 --> 11:35.393
      by a doddery old man      
 than an efficient young woman? 

11:35.395 --> 11:37.027
  That is right, little girl,   

11:37.029 --> 11:40.197
    because a woman doctor's    
only good for women's problems, 

11:40.199 --> 11:41.899
like your "groinecology" there. 

11:47.272 --> 11:49.840
     For a man's problems,      
     you need a man doctor      

11:49.842 --> 11:52.976
    who knows his way around    
        in there.               

11:52.978 --> 11:56.914
 Nobody wants some nervous dame 
    foostering around there.    

11:56.916 --> 11:58.716
    I mean, she'd cut           
        the wrong string        

11:58.718 --> 12:00.484
and the poor guy's keister      
        would fall off.         

12:03.455 --> 12:05.889
                          Daddy!

12:05.891 --> 12:07.925
        What about you?         
  What kind of a wife are you?  

12:07.927 --> 12:09.627
    Ain't you got no concern    
    for your husband?           

12:09.629 --> 12:11.796
         He don't want          
 to be operated on by no woman. 

12:11.798 --> 12:13.864
    All right, Daddy,           
that's enough out of you.       

12:13.866 --> 12:15.733
  Michael, what do you think?   

12:15.735 --> 12:18.202
Should we call                  
Audrey Stern?                   

12:18.204 --> 12:20.438
     I don't know, Gloria.      
I was just thinking, uh,        

12:20.440 --> 12:23.240
I don't know if I like the idea 
  of a friend operating on me.  

12:23.242 --> 12:25.976
    Friend? You only met her    
         a couple times         

12:25.978 --> 12:27.712
at the committee meetings.      

12:27.714 --> 12:29.947
Michael, she hardly rates       
      as your best buddy.       

12:29.949 --> 12:31.682
Yeah, but even so, she knows me.

12:31.684 --> 12:32.950
    It's an emotional thing.    

12:34.419 --> 12:37.655
     Michael, Audrey Stern      
  is a fully qualified surgeon, 

12:37.657 --> 12:39.122
and she's less expensive.       

12:39.124 --> 12:40.791
  Gloria, it's not the money.   

12:40.793 --> 12:42.292
Well, what is it,               
then, Michael?                  

12:42.294 --> 12:44.328
Are you saying that             
a woman's reflexes              

12:44.330 --> 12:46.364
are slower than a man's?        
                  Of course not.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.866
Or her hands aren't as steady?  
                             No.

12:48.868 --> 12:51.068
 Well, then it must be that men 
    are smarter than women.     

12:51.070 --> 12:52.069
          Is that it?           

12:52.071 --> 12:54.037
        Bull's-eye, little girl.

12:56.441 --> 12:59.042
      Bull, period, Daddy.      

13:00.779 --> 13:02.646
            You hear the lip on 
            your daughter there?

13:02.648 --> 13:04.648
Mm-hmm.                         

13:04.650 --> 13:06.450
Well, Michael?                  

13:09.120 --> 13:11.188
Is that it? Are men             
smarter than women?             

13:11.190 --> 13:12.590
                Gloria, I didn't
                say that.       

13:12.592 --> 13:13.758
Yeah, but                       
you meant it.                   

13:13.760 --> 13:16.360
    Admit it, Michael.          
    You're as bad as Daddy.     

13:16.362 --> 13:18.596
    You're prejudiced           
    against a woman surgeon.    

13:18.598 --> 13:20.364
  Gloria, this is my appendix.  

13:20.366 --> 13:23.267
    It's my operation,          
  so I want to pick my doctor!  

13:23.269 --> 13:24.869
And pay him with my money.      

13:24.871 --> 13:27.772
    Oh, now it's your money.    

13:27.774 --> 13:29.573
A minute ago, it was our money. 

13:29.575 --> 13:30.941
 All right, Michael, our money, 

13:30.943 --> 13:33.944
    but that means at least     
I have a say in how we spend it.

13:33.946 --> 13:36.046
 Yes! When it's your appendix,  
    you'll have a say.          

13:36.048 --> 13:37.281
Oh, listen,                     
Michael, this is--              

13:37.283 --> 13:38.348
        No, you listen--        

13:38.350 --> 13:39.617
              Aah!              

13:39.619 --> 13:40.618
Michael,                        
what's the matter?!             

13:40.620 --> 13:41.619
                That's it.      
                It's flaring up.

13:41.621 --> 13:42.820
                Call the doctor.
                Call the doctor.

13:42.822 --> 13:43.821
Ma, call the doctor.            

13:43.823 --> 13:46.089
          Right away!           

13:46.091 --> 13:49.393
        Which one?              

13:49.395 --> 13:51.028
    Give me that telephone,     
        will you?               

13:51.030 --> 13:52.463
         I'll do that.          

13:52.465 --> 13:54.932
You don't know how to make      
    no emergency call.          

13:54.934 --> 13:56.366
      Listen, hey, Gloria.      

13:56.368 --> 13:58.035
     Cover up the meathead      
          over there.           

13:58.037 --> 13:59.437
 I'll make the phone call here, 

13:59.439 --> 14:01.004
        and Edith, you--        

14:01.006 --> 14:02.473
        Get some ketchup        
         on the table.          

14:07.345 --> 14:09.046
         Oh, I think I'm running
         a temperature.         

14:09.048 --> 14:10.847
EDITH: I'll get                 
the thermometer.                

14:10.849 --> 14:12.583
        Yeah, I'm burning up.   

14:12.585 --> 14:13.984
I'll get you a cool cloth,      
            Michael.            

14:13.986 --> 14:15.819
    ARCHIE: Yeah, well,         
    when are you gonna hear     

14:15.821 --> 14:17.521
      from Dr. McKenzie?        
Dr. McKenzie? Daddy!            

14:17.523 --> 14:19.523
        Shush, will you?        
        I'm on the line here.   

14:19.525 --> 14:20.657
        Excuse me.              

14:20.659 --> 14:22.893
    Yeah? Yeah, well, all right.

14:22.895 --> 14:25.563
     Well, when he comes in,    
     have him call us, will you?

14:25.565 --> 14:26.997
        As quick as possibly.   

14:26.999 --> 14:28.665
      Yeah, thank you very much.

14:28.667 --> 14:30.634
Daddy, why did you go           
and call Dr. McKenzie?          

14:30.636 --> 14:32.269
You knew I wanted               
Dr. Audrey Stern.               

14:32.271 --> 14:33.471
How could you do that?          

14:33.473 --> 14:35.706
         Arch? What did         
    Dr. McKenzie say?           

14:35.708 --> 14:37.040
     I didn't talk to him.      

14:37.042 --> 14:38.542
          Don't worry.          
  They're trying to find him.   

14:38.544 --> 14:40.744
    He's gonna call us          
    as soon as he comes in.     

14:40.746 --> 14:42.012
         Thanks, Arch.          

14:42.014 --> 14:43.180
            Thanks?             

14:43.182 --> 14:44.982
Michael, you knew               
I didn't want Dr. McKenzie.     

14:44.984 --> 14:46.917
I mean, we hadn't               
decided, had we?                

14:46.919 --> 14:47.918
                      Well...   

14:47.920 --> 14:49.353
I mean, you know                
Audrey Stern                    

14:49.355 --> 14:50.588
and you like her,               
right?                          

14:50.590 --> 14:51.589
                      Right.    

14:51.591 --> 14:52.823
And she's                       
a good surgeon?                 

14:52.825 --> 14:54.024
                     Right.     
  So?                           

14:54.026 --> 14:57.561
So I'm glad Archie called       
         Dr. McKenzie.          

14:57.563 --> 14:59.430
         Daddy, this is         
        all your fault.         

14:59.432 --> 15:02.166
Listen, little girl,            
one of the facts of life        

15:02.168 --> 15:04.835
is that doctors                 
are supposed to be men.         

15:04.837 --> 15:07.037
Men invented medicine,          
didn't they?                    

15:07.039 --> 15:10.374
Men made up                     
your Hypocritical Oath there.   

15:10.376 --> 15:12.909
Women, if they want to be       
something, let them be nurses.  

15:12.911 --> 15:14.911
             That's a ridiculous
             argument, Daddy.   

15:14.913 --> 15:17.548
            Michael,            
    here's your thermometer.    

15:17.550 --> 15:18.715
                 Oh, thanks, Ma.

15:18.717 --> 15:21.318
  Can I get you some more ice   
         for your side?         

15:21.320 --> 15:22.719
        No, this is fine, Ma.   

15:22.721 --> 15:25.556
Michael, we could get           
Audrey Stern here in a flash    

15:25.558 --> 15:28.325
and save ourselves $200         
at the same time,               

15:28.327 --> 15:30.327
but no, you won't               
trust a woman.                  

15:30.329 --> 15:31.762
    [MUMBLING] Gloria,          
      that's not the point.     

15:31.764 --> 15:33.397
I just want a good doctor!      

15:33.399 --> 15:35.666
     He's absolutely right.     

15:35.668 --> 15:37.000
      McKenzie costs more       

15:37.002 --> 15:39.503
        because the best        
    always cost more.           

15:39.505 --> 15:41.372
      That's how you tell       
    what's good in America.     

15:41.374 --> 15:43.907
         It costs more.         

15:43.909 --> 15:49.647
     Sometimes Marcus Welby     
  don't charge nothing at all.  

15:52.917 --> 15:56.720
    And you can't get           
        better than him.        

15:56.722 --> 16:00.057
         Maybe we ought         
to turn on the TV, Edith,       

16:00.059 --> 16:03.394
      and Welby will jump       
  out of the set and help us.   

16:03.396 --> 16:05.896
          Daddy, McKenzie gets  
          more than Audrey Stern

16:05.898 --> 16:07.898
            because women are   
            always underpaid.   

16:07.900 --> 16:08.999
                     Look at Ma!

16:09.001 --> 16:10.601
What are you dragging           
her into it for?                

16:10.603 --> 16:11.768
She don't work.                 

16:11.770 --> 16:14.238
        Oh, no? What do you call
        housework, a vacation?  

16:14.240 --> 16:15.573
Well, it ain't work.            

16:15.575 --> 16:17.208
You never see nobody            
paying for it.                  

16:17.210 --> 16:19.276
          No, you sure don't see
          Ma paid for it.       

16:19.278 --> 16:23.681
    No, I sure don't see me     
    being paid for it.          

16:23.683 --> 16:25.749
Will you stifle                 
yourself over there?            

16:25.751 --> 16:29.553
        Well, housework         
  is an important job, Archie.  

16:29.555 --> 16:32.323
     It's just as important     
          as your job.          

16:32.325 --> 16:35.259
 That is a whole lot of baloney 
         there, Edith.          

16:35.261 --> 16:36.760
The man is the breadwinner      

16:36.762 --> 16:38.729
         and you women          
  have your bread won for you.  

16:38.731 --> 16:40.531
      That's the way it is      
      all over the world.       

16:40.533 --> 16:42.466
      You're wrong, Arch.       
There are plenty of tribes      

16:42.468 --> 16:45.068
where the men sit at home       
 and the women go out to work.  

16:45.070 --> 16:46.270
      Where, where, where?      

16:46.272 --> 16:48.171
     Well, there's a tribe      
        in New Guinea...        

16:48.173 --> 16:50.140
    Don't be bringing           
     the I-talians into it.     

16:55.714 --> 16:57.981
God made women to stay at home. 

16:57.983 --> 17:01.252
 How do you know that, Archie?

Because it's in the Bible,      
    Edith. Look it up, huh?

        All them old Bible guys,

17:06.659 --> 17:09.092
    they was always out there   
    hunting and fishing.        

17:09.094 --> 17:11.328
        The women stayed home   
        and had babies,         

17:11.329 --> 17:13.329
        which they called       
        in them days "begotten,"

17:13.332 --> 17:16.933
          for religious reasons.

17:16.935 --> 17:18.269
            And in between      
            all the begotten,   

17:18.271 --> 17:19.970

          up the tents,

             Now, this is awful.

17:47.667 --> 17:50.867
      I better pack a bag       
for the hospital for him,

What did Dr. McKenzie say?      

17:54.440 --> 17:55.939
  I didn't talk to him, Edith.

    for an operation.           

18:11.256 --> 18:15.125

He's really sick.

                about that?

about that.

what I can't do, little girl.

        a little bit better now?

Yeah, a little bit better.

          right over here.

                     all packed.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.534

  about going to the hospital.  

20:03.536 --> 20:04.902
I mean, I feel better now.      

20:04.904 --> 20:07.137
        Oh, it's just like      
        going to the dentist.

            stops aching.       

20:10.943 --> 20:13.143
          Yeah. I wish          
    this were a tooth.          

20:13.145 --> 20:14.578
         Oh, no, Mike.          

20:14.580 --> 20:20.651
 It would be much more serious  
if there was a tooth down there.

20:25.757 --> 20:28.191
    What was that, Ma?          

20:28.193 --> 20:30.961
            Well, you would have
            to have swallowed it

20:30.963 --> 20:32.362
              like a cherry pit,

20:32.364 --> 20:35.298
         and it would've got    
         stuck in your appendix.

20:35.300 --> 20:36.500
        Stop, Ma.               

20:36.502 --> 20:39.870
     When Mrs. Wiedermeyer      
     had her appendix out,      

20:39.872 --> 20:43.239
     the doctor said it was     
 an apple seed stuck in there.  

20:43.241 --> 20:45.241
        Stop, Ma.               

20:45.243 --> 20:51.147
  And, um, it... It puffed out  
      like a big balloon,       

20:51.149 --> 20:54.818
    and the doctor got to it    
    just before it blew up.     

20:56.454 --> 20:58.822
    I think I'm sick again.     

20:58.824 --> 21:00.023
All right, we're all set.       

21:00.025 --> 21:02.225
        I called a cab.         
It'll be over in a few minutes. 

21:02.227 --> 21:04.227
        Oh, gee, I'm not looking
        forward to this at all. 

21:04.229 --> 21:05.261

and his razor?                  

21:11.203 --> 21:13.069
Ah, he won't need no razor      
        in the hospital.

    any shaving to be done,

21:25.818 --> 21:26.884
        Stop it, Daddy.         

21:26.886 --> 21:28.685

to cheer him up.                

21:28.687 --> 21:31.889
        His pajamas.            
        I forgot his pajamas.

21:34.894 --> 21:36.960
Michael, what's                 
the matter?

    slipped!                    

21:49.507 --> 21:50.741
                  Is he all     
                  right, doctor?

21:50.743 --> 21:52.042
Yes, he's fine.                 

21:52.044 --> 21:53.577
He'll be coming around          
any minute now.                 

21:53.579 --> 21:56.413
        Any problems with the   
        operation there, doc?   

21:56.415 --> 21:57.447
No, no problems at all.

That appendix came out          
like a loose cork.              

22:02.020 --> 22:04.021
But you didn't get him here     
a minute too soon.              

22:04.023 --> 22:05.822

straight onto the table.

was lying on it.

Oh, forgive me                  
for laughing, doctor,           

22:59.511 --> 23:02.045
but my father though            
that you were an old man        

23:02.047 --> 23:04.047
and I'm glad you're not.        

23:04.049 --> 23:05.515
                    So am I.    

23:05.517 --> 23:06.950
Daddy, would you                
come over here                  

23:06.952 --> 23:07.951
for a second, please?           

23:07.953 --> 23:09.385
                    I have to   
                    talk to you.

23:09.387 --> 23:10.754
What?                           
                      Come here.

23:10.756 --> 23:13.724
         I-- I just want to know
         what you think now.    

23:13.726 --> 23:15.458
         I mean, the operation's
         a success,             

23:15.460 --> 23:18.061
              and it was done   
              by a woman doctor,

23:18.063 --> 23:20.196
             and Michael's      
             keister's still on.

23:47.258 --> 23:49.660
 Look at him eating over here.  

23:49.662 --> 23:51.294
     Got his appendix out,      

23:51.296 --> 23:54.264
so now he's got more room       
          down there.           

23:54.266 --> 23:56.133
        You're not going        
     to get me angry, Arch.     

23:56.135 --> 23:58.835
         I feel great.          
 The operation was sensation--  

23:58.837 --> 23:59.836
                 Oh, don't go on

23:59.838 --> 24:01.104
            talking about the   
            operation, will you?

24:01.106 --> 24:02.172
            We're sick of it.   

24:02.174 --> 24:03.974
Oh, no, I want                  
to hear about it                

24:03.976 --> 24:05.408
so I can remember it.           

24:05.410 --> 24:07.010
             What do you want   
             to remember it for?

24:07.012 --> 24:08.211
              You writing a book
              or something?     

24:08.213 --> 24:10.547
No, it's for Sybil Gooley.      

24:10.549 --> 24:13.349
    She's always telling me     
      about her operation,      

24:13.351 --> 24:16.753
and now I got an operation      
    to tell her about.          

24:16.755 --> 24:19.890
 You don't mind if I use yours, 
         do you, Mike?          

24:19.892 --> 24:21.825
No, Ma, just make sure          
to tell her                     

24:21.827 --> 24:23.660
how good Dr. McKenzie was.      

24:23.662 --> 24:26.396
                Well, hooray    
                for our side.   

24:26.398 --> 24:29.599
                  One giant step
                  for womankind.

24:29.601 --> 24:31.634
      I wish the womankind      
         at this table          

24:31.636 --> 24:33.870
would take one giant step       
        into the kitchen        

24:33.872 --> 24:36.006
and come back with some ketchup.

24:36.008 --> 24:37.440
  No, Ma, you sit               
  right there                   

24:37.442 --> 24:38.608
  and enjoy                     
  your dinner.                  

24:38.610 --> 24:39.810
  If Daddy wants                
  the ketchup,                  

24:39.812 --> 24:41.211
  he can get it                 
  for himself.                  

24:41.213 --> 24:43.213
         Who the hell are you...

24:43.215 --> 24:47.283
      [ALL ARGUING LOUDLY]      

25:06.738 --> 25:08.705
