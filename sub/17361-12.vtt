WEBVTT

00:09.592 --> 00:12.584
(walker growling)

00:14.431 --> 00:16.922
Diane.

00:17.100 --> 00:20.684
Got it.

00:22.355 --> 00:24.220
(growling continues)

00:24.399 --> 00:26.060
(growling stops)

00:26.234 --> 00:27.895
Man: Good shot.

00:29.529 --> 00:30.894
My sister
had that dress.

00:31.072 --> 00:32.608
Don't think about it.

00:32.782 --> 00:34.693
(vehicles approaching)

00:48.882 --> 00:50.497
Nice.

00:52.135 --> 00:53.250
(sighs)

00:53.428 --> 00:55.510
It's getting to be
like clockwork.

01:03.563 --> 01:05.269
Now, boss?

01:05.440 --> 01:07.431
Yes, Jerry.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.864
It looks light.

01:17.035 --> 01:19.526
Perhaps you might
look again, Gavin.

01:19.704 --> 01:21.740
We've met
our obligations.

01:26.836 --> 01:28.121
Huh.

01:28.296 --> 01:29.706
You're right.

01:29.881 --> 01:33.794
Doesn't seem like much,
but 8, 9, 10.

01:33.968 --> 01:35.378
You're right.

01:35.553 --> 01:38.295
Jared:
I want his gun.

01:39.390 --> 01:42.723
In fact,
I don't think this asshole

01:42.894 --> 01:45.351
should have a gun ever.

01:46.481 --> 01:47.812
No guns
for bad boys.

01:49.025 --> 01:50.765
You hit me first,
prick.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.481
(chuckles)

01:53.655 --> 01:55.270
- (guns cock)
- What's that?

01:59.327 --> 02:01.033
Gavin: Okay.

02:01.204 --> 02:03.365
Where do we go
from here?

02:03.540 --> 02:06.953
That's right,
Your Majesty.

02:07.127 --> 02:10.369
Where do we go
from here?

02:13.424 --> 02:16.791
Hand him your weapon,
Richard.

02:28.022 --> 02:31.765
Stand down, idiot.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.190
Suck on it,
you little shit.

02:36.364 --> 02:38.821
- Richard!
- (grunts)

02:38.992 --> 02:40.732
Aah!
(grunts)

02:45.957 --> 02:47.413
(grunting)

02:47.584 --> 02:48.994
Gavin:
Stand down!

02:49.169 --> 02:52.411
(grunts)

02:53.673 --> 02:55.584
Gavin: Ezekiel,
you know I can't have this.

02:55.758 --> 02:57.134
Ezekiel:
We can't have this.

02:57.302 --> 03:01.261
Richard will refrain from
attending our future exchanges.

03:01.431 --> 03:04.798
No. No, Ezekiel, you're gonna
keep bringing him.

03:04.976 --> 03:07.137
'Cause if
this doesn't stop,

03:07.312 --> 03:10.099
if this starts becoming
a real problem,

03:10.273 --> 03:12.229
you remember
what I said.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.641
He is still batting first
on the lineup.

03:14.819 --> 03:16.650
Almost did it myself
just now.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.026
Hey.

03:21.201 --> 03:25.240
I know
it's not his fault, but...

03:25.413 --> 03:28.280
this has got to stop.

03:28.458 --> 03:29.618
So...

03:29.792 --> 03:33.785
things might need
to get a little...

03:33.963 --> 03:35.248
visceral.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.378
Jared,
get the hell up!

03:39.552 --> 03:41.668
Let's get
the hell out of here.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.133
Can I, um...

03:48.311 --> 03:51.053
can I have
my stick back, please?

03:53.066 --> 03:55.352
Someone gave it to me.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.267
Someone who's gone.

03:58.446 --> 04:00.061
Gavin, you got to let me
tune up this dipshit.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.403
No! No!

04:03.576 --> 04:04.861
JusL"

04:06.162 --> 04:09.279
read the goddamn room,
senseL

04:09.457 --> 04:11.038
Let's go.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.460
(car doors opening)

04:20.093 --> 04:21.708
(car doors closing)

04:21.886 --> 04:24.127
(engines start)

04:32.188 --> 04:34.930
(brakes squeal)

04:40.071 --> 04:41.607
Yeah.

04:43.491 --> 04:45.197
My sister
loved that dress.

04:49.789 --> 04:50.995
(truck door closes)

04:52.875 --> 04:55.082
You were quick
with that today.

04:55.253 --> 04:57.335
Impressive, Benjamin.

04:57.505 --> 04:58.620
Told you
I'm getting better.

04:58.798 --> 05:01.585
You were
a trifle too quick.

05:01.759 --> 05:03.590
Just because
you now know how to fight

05:03.761 --> 05:05.046
doesn't mean
you should seek one.

05:05.221 --> 05:06.882
Yeah, but itjust happened.
I wasn't thinking.

05:07.056 --> 05:09.217
You have to.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.883
Every time from
this time forward, so you shall.

05:12.061 --> 05:13.642
Yes?

05:15.982 --> 05:17.392
Yes.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.273
(truck door closes)

05:19.444 --> 05:21.730
Richard.

05:21.904 --> 05:25.271
We shall speak later.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.736
Jerry.

05:30.204 --> 05:31.740
You're sick
with this stick, man.

05:31.914 --> 05:33.654
Ezekiel: Jerry!

05:36.085 --> 05:38.622
Hey, uh, do you want
to head to the infirmary?

05:38.796 --> 05:40.297
No. I'm okay.

05:40.465 --> 05:41.750
Daryl: Hey.

05:41.924 --> 05:43.630
Where'd you go
in them trucks?

05:43.801 --> 05:45.917
lneed
to speak to Daryl alone.

05:46.095 --> 05:47.346
That okay?

05:48.473 --> 05:49.758
Yeah, I'll get you something
for that cut.

05:49.932 --> 05:52.139
Yeah.

05:53.436 --> 05:55.301
You went to see them, right?

05:55.480 --> 05:56.811
Yeah.

05:56.981 --> 05:58.892
Part of your deal?

06:03.488 --> 06:05.228
What the hell's wrong
with you?

06:06.282 --> 06:08.273
You're bleeding.

06:10.745 --> 06:12.610
They did that to you.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.780
You know what they are.

06:14.957 --> 06:17.118
I do.

06:20.171 --> 06:23.254
You know,
if Carol were here,

06:23.424 --> 06:25.005
she saw all that...

06:25.176 --> 06:27.792
if she knew
about Abraham...

06:27.970 --> 06:30.052
and Glenn...

06:32.225 --> 06:34.591
she'd be leading us
right to them,

06:34.769 --> 06:36.600
ready to
kill them all.

06:36.771 --> 06:39.057
She would.

06:39.232 --> 06:42.474
And that's why
she left, man.

06:48.616 --> 06:50.356
(scoffs)

07:01.170 --> 07:03.286
(horse neighs in distance)

07:14.976 --> 07:16.386
I'm practicing.

07:18.438 --> 07:22.056
Gonna have to start
using these more.

07:22.233 --> 07:23.473
The Saviors
are smart enough to know

07:23.651 --> 07:25.858
lshouldn't have a gun
around them.

07:32.034 --> 07:36.243
Morgan said
you're a bowman.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.331
Why?

07:50.845 --> 07:53.177
'Cause we want
the same things.

07:53.347 --> 07:55.554
I need your help.

08:08.112 --> 08:11.024
(music playing)

08:53.157 --> 08:56.240
Richard: We need something
to move Ezekiel.

08:56.410 --> 08:57.946
This is it.

08:59.121 --> 09:01.453
Alexandria, the Hilltop,
and the Kingdom hitting first,

09:01.624 --> 09:04.536
hitting hard, and then we wipe
the Saviors from the Earth.

09:07.880 --> 09:08.869
Keeping people--

09:09.048 --> 09:12.586
dozens and dozens and dozens
of good people...

09:14.053 --> 09:15.259
keeping them safe.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.298
They ride this road.

09:54.468 --> 09:56.925
If we see cars,
it's the Saviors.

09:58.639 --> 10:00.630
They've been coming in packs
of two or three lately.

10:01.767 --> 10:02.756
That's why I need you.

10:02.935 --> 10:04.971
lcanT
take them alone.

10:05.146 --> 10:07.353
We're gonna hit them
with the guns first...

10:07.523 --> 10:08.979
and then the Molotovs.

10:09.150 --> 10:11.766
Then back to the guns
until they're dead.

10:11.944 --> 10:15.857
- Why the fire?
- Needs to look bad.

10:16.032 --> 10:19.115
The Saviors who discover
what's left...

10:19.285 --> 10:21.526
we want them
to be angry.

10:21.704 --> 10:25.447
I left a trail from here
to the weapons cache I planted,

10:25.625 --> 10:28.082
to the cabin of that someone
Ezekiel cares about.

10:28.252 --> 10:29.583
Who's that?

10:29.754 --> 10:31.585
It's just
some loner he met.

10:31.756 --> 10:34.088
Sometimes he brings food.

10:34.258 --> 10:35.589
Why don't they live
in the Kingdom?

10:35.760 --> 10:36.875
I don't know.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.419
She lives out there,
she'll die out there.

10:41.015 --> 10:43.051
It's a woman?

10:43.225 --> 10:45.807
What does that matter?
She's got more balls than you and me.

10:48.230 --> 10:50.391
She's gonna die
either way.

10:51.525 --> 10:53.686
When the Saviors come
and find their buddies dead,

10:53.861 --> 10:55.397
if they know their elbow
from their asshole

10:55.571 --> 10:58.153
and can follow
an obvious spoor,

10:58.324 --> 11:01.441
they're gonna go to the weapons
cache and then to the cabin,

11:01.619 --> 11:03.951
and they're gonna attack
this woman.

11:04.121 --> 11:05.657
What's her name?

11:05.831 --> 11:08.083
Maybe they kill her,
maybe they don't,

11:08.250 --> 11:10.866
but it's gonna show Ezekiel
what he needs to do.

11:11.045 --> 11:13.411
Her name.
What is it?

11:13.589 --> 11:15.705
She's tough.
Maybe she'll live.

11:15.883 --> 11:17.293
Say her damn name!

11:19.970 --> 11:22.712
(sighs)

11:26.060 --> 11:27.641
Carol.

11:27.812 --> 11:29.768
lhoped
you didn't know her,

11:29.939 --> 11:31.895
but I didn't think
you'd care,

11:32.066 --> 11:34.432
'cause you know
what needs to happen.

11:34.610 --> 11:36.066
- No.
- Maybe she'll live.

11:36.237 --> 11:37.977
Look, this--
this is how--

11:38.155 --> 11:40.111
this is how
this could happen.

11:40.282 --> 11:42.113
This is how we can get rid
of the Saviors,

11:42.284 --> 11:44.536
how we all
can have a future.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.369
She's living out there
on her own,

11:47.540 --> 11:48.950
- just waiting to die.
- No!

11:49.125 --> 11:50.114
If we don't do anything,

11:50.292 --> 11:51.748
a hell of a lot more people
are gonna die,

11:53.337 --> 11:54.918
You stay the hell away
from Carol, you hear me?

11:55.089 --> 11:57.375
(vehicles approaching)

12:05.141 --> 12:07.052
lt's them.

12:10.312 --> 12:13.349
Look, we can wait
for things to go bad,

12:13.524 --> 12:14.934
we lose people...

12:16.902 --> 12:19.063
or we can do
the hard thing...

12:20.948 --> 12:23.485
and choose our fate
for ourselves.

12:23.659 --> 12:24.944
No.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.529
Sorry.

12:29.039 --> 12:31.291
(both grunting)

12:33.544 --> 12:37.128
(breathing heavily)

12:51.353 --> 12:53.218
(panting)

12:55.024 --> 12:56.184
There'll be more.

12:56.358 --> 12:58.815
Or those--

12:58.986 --> 13:02.069
they're gonna
ride back this way later.

13:02.239 --> 13:04.491
We'll have
another chance.

13:04.658 --> 13:08.025
But we're running
out of time.

13:08.204 --> 13:11.992
If you and your people want
to move against the Saviors...

13:12.166 --> 13:15.579
you need to do it soon,
and you need the Kingdom.

13:18.923 --> 13:22.666
What we have to do requires
sacrifice one way or another.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.007
Guys like us...

13:27.181 --> 13:30.389
we've already lost
so much.

13:30.559 --> 13:32.595
You don't know me.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.010
I know...

13:34.188 --> 13:37.976
that Carol,
living on her own like that...

13:41.278 --> 13:43.485
she might as well be dead
right now.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.407
She gets hurt,
she dies,

13:48.577 --> 13:51.319
if she catches a fever,

13:51.497 --> 13:53.533
if she's taken out
by a walker...

13:53.707 --> 13:56.414
if she gets hit
by lightning--

13:56.585 --> 14:00.874
anything-- anything happens
to her, I'll kill you.

14:09.223 --> 14:12.056
I would die
for the Kingdom.

14:12.226 --> 14:14.308
Then why don't you?

14:34.290 --> 14:36.781
(rattling)

14:48.470 --> 14:51.803
(metal clanking)

15:06.822 --> 15:10.064
(door creaking)

16:53.262 --> 16:55.674
Woman: Are you a collective,
or does one lead?

16:57.766 --> 16:58.972
This.

17:05.441 --> 17:08.057
Hi.

17:08.235 --> 17:11.227
I'm Rick.

17:11.405 --> 17:14.647
We own your lives.

17:14.825 --> 17:17.567
You want
to buy them back?

17:19.455 --> 17:21.787
Have anything?

17:21.957 --> 17:24.073
Well, you have
one of my people.

17:24.251 --> 17:25.411
Gabriel.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.451
I want
to see him first.

17:27.629 --> 17:30.211
Then we can talk.

18:03.749 --> 18:07.116
The boat things you took
got taken.

18:07.294 --> 18:10.536
Saw them,
so we took the rest.

18:10.714 --> 18:12.796
And we took him.

18:14.009 --> 18:15.044
Well, then you know
we have nothing

18:15.219 --> 18:17.631
to buy back
our lives with.

18:19.306 --> 18:23.299
That's what you'll have soon--
nothing.

18:23.477 --> 18:25.889
Because me and my people
already belong to that group

18:26.063 --> 18:28.520
who took those supplies
from the boat.

18:28.690 --> 18:30.521
They're called
the Saviors.

18:30.692 --> 18:33.024
They own our lives.

18:33.195 --> 18:35.527
And if you kill us,

18:35.697 --> 18:38.825
you'll be taking something
from them.

18:41.578 --> 18:45.491
And they will come looking.

18:47.417 --> 18:50.079
You only have two options
when it comes to the Saviors--

18:50.254 --> 18:54.418
either they kill you
or they own you.

18:55.676 --> 18:58.713
But there is a way out.

18:58.887 --> 19:00.502
Join us.

19:00.681 --> 19:04.094
Join us
in fighting them.

19:13.735 --> 19:15.191
No.

19:28.876 --> 19:31.618
(grunts)

19:31.795 --> 19:33.251
Rosita, don't!

19:33.422 --> 19:34.457
(grunting)

19:34.631 --> 19:36.622
Everybody, stop!

19:36.800 --> 19:38.301
Just wait!

19:41.096 --> 19:44.839
Gabriel: Let us go,
or I will kill her!

19:47.477 --> 19:50.935
Away from Tamiel now.

19:51.106 --> 19:53.563
The Saviors,
they--

19:53.734 --> 19:58.103
they have other places,
other communities.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.271
They have things--

20:00.449 --> 20:04.738
food, weapons,
vehicles, fuel.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.493
Whatever you want,
the Saviors have it.

20:21.970 --> 20:24.461
Away from Tamiel.

20:39.321 --> 20:41.107
Your words now.

20:43.825 --> 20:46.817
If you join us
and we beat them together,

20:46.995 --> 20:51.159
you can have
much of what's theirs.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.665
Fighting with us,
you'll be rewarded,

20:53.835 --> 20:56.998
more than
you can imagine.

20:57.172 --> 20:59.333
Want something now.

21:01.218 --> 21:02.378
Rick...

21:02.552 --> 21:05.840
can do anything.

21:06.014 --> 21:08.676
This group?

21:08.850 --> 21:13.014
They found me--
here, so far from our home.

21:13.188 --> 21:15.224
What do you need?

21:15.399 --> 21:18.015
Just tell us--
we'll get it for you.

21:18.193 --> 21:21.230
We'll show you
what we can do.

21:21.405 --> 21:22.986
Now.

21:24.700 --> 21:28.033
(wind whistling)

21:33.208 --> 21:35.665
Tamiel, Brion...

21:35.836 --> 21:38.248
show Rick Up Up Up.

21:46.054 --> 21:48.670
It's okay.

22:06.783 --> 22:08.694
Here.

22:08.869 --> 22:09.904
Sit.

22:10.078 --> 22:11.864
Thanks.
I'm okay.

22:15.709 --> 22:18.542
Who are
these people?

22:18.712 --> 22:20.077
(clatters)

22:20.255 --> 22:23.747
New best friends,
lguess?

22:26.303 --> 22:28.385
Where are they
taking him?

23:11.973 --> 23:15.181
All of us,
here since the change.

23:15.352 --> 23:16.592
We take.

23:16.770 --> 23:19.807
We don't bother.

23:19.981 --> 23:23.473
Things grow harder.

23:23.652 --> 23:26.735
We open cans,
sometimes inside's rotten.

23:28.657 --> 23:31.069
Time's passed.

23:31.243 --> 23:34.701
Things are changing again.

23:34.871 --> 23:38.659
So maybe we change.

23:38.834 --> 23:40.074
Maybe.

23:43.046 --> 23:45.128
Need to know
you're real with this,

23:45.298 --> 23:48.165
that you're worth it.

23:48.343 --> 23:49.708
Unh!

23:57.352 --> 24:01.436
Michonne:
What did you do?!

24:06.361 --> 24:08.852
(breathing heavily)

24:09.030 --> 24:11.021
(panting)

24:11.199 --> 24:13.235
(grunts)

24:14.369 --> 24:16.530
Michonne: Rick!

24:22.210 --> 24:25.998
I'm all right.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.504
(clattering)

24:34.055 --> 24:37.297
(walker growling)

24:44.900 --> 24:50.315
(growling continues)

24:52.741 --> 24:53.981
Rick!

25:09.049 --> 25:11.131
(grunting)

25:22.437 --> 25:24.098
Aah!

25:24.272 --> 25:25.933
Aah!

25:26.107 --> 25:28.484
(groans)

25:28.652 --> 25:30.142
(growling continues)

25:30.320 --> 25:33.904
(groans)

25:48.171 --> 25:50.207
Aah!

25:56.471 --> 25:58.132
Michonne: The walls!

25:58.306 --> 25:59.591
Use them!

25:59.766 --> 26:03.384
(growling continues)

26:17.701 --> 26:22.786
(growling continues)

26:24.958 --> 26:27.370
(grunting)

26:27.544 --> 26:31.207
(walker gurgling)

26:31.381 --> 26:36.216
(walker gasping)

26:36.386 --> 26:39.002
(breathing heavily)

26:43.268 --> 26:45.634
You believe us now?!

26:47.522 --> 26:49.513
Just tell us
what you want...

26:49.691 --> 26:51.852
and we'll get it.

26:52.027 --> 26:53.483
(clatters)

26:53.653 --> 26:57.191
(panting)

27:08.585 --> 27:11.748
(grunting)

27:11.921 --> 27:15.163
(panting)

27:53.254 --> 27:54.960
Guns.

27:55.131 --> 27:57.087
A lot.

27:57.258 --> 27:58.759
A lot.

28:00.470 --> 28:02.176
And then
we fight your fight.

28:06.267 --> 28:08.849
(chucang)

28:18.113 --> 28:21.947
You know we will win?

28:22.117 --> 28:24.824
Oh, I know it.

28:24.994 --> 28:27.906
After, we get half
of what's won.

28:28.081 --> 28:29.571
Oh, you'll get
a third.

28:29.749 --> 28:32.832
And we're taking back
what you just stole from us.

28:35.088 --> 28:36.498
Half.

28:36.673 --> 28:37.788
A third.

28:37.966 --> 28:39.172
Half.

28:39.342 --> 28:41.333
(chuckles)

28:41.511 --> 28:43.422
A third.

28:44.472 --> 28:47.179
A third,
and we keep what we stole.

28:47.350 --> 28:51.093
(chuckles)

28:52.147 --> 28:55.639
Half of the jars,
the ones we took.

28:55.817 --> 28:57.682
One time, this time.

28:57.861 --> 28:59.351
Yes?

29:00.989 --> 29:04.607
Say yes.

29:04.784 --> 29:07.196
Yes.

29:07.370 --> 29:10.157
And the guns.

29:10.331 --> 29:13.664
(chuckles)
And the guns.

29:22.969 --> 29:25.210
Waited by the boat
long time.

29:25.388 --> 29:27.549
Want something for it.

29:27.724 --> 29:29.180
So it's this.

29:29.350 --> 29:33.184
Jars and guns,
guns and jars.

29:33.354 --> 29:35.731
You waited for someone

29:35.899 --> 29:38.060
to get the supplies
off that boat for you?

29:38.234 --> 29:39.519
Long time.

29:39.694 --> 29:42.857
We take.
We don't bother.

29:48.411 --> 29:51.369
thing down there
for someone to prove themselves?

29:51.539 --> 29:52.870
No.

29:53.041 --> 29:55.327
His name was Winslow.

30:00.423 --> 30:02.539
What were you gonna do
with Gabriel?

30:02.717 --> 30:05.379
Go.

30:05.553 --> 30:08.010
Deal expires.

30:08.181 --> 30:10.888
Soon.

30:12.435 --> 30:16.223
What's your name?

30:16.397 --> 30:18.353
Jadis.

30:36.209 --> 30:39.542
(wind whistling)

30:58.773 --> 31:01.014
We have a deal.

31:23.965 --> 31:27.048
(door creaks)

31:37.270 --> 31:39.135
I told Richard
no more visits.

31:39.314 --> 31:40.770
Ezekiel:
I am aware.

31:40.940 --> 31:42.350
Your desire
is solitude.

31:42.525 --> 31:44.857
That's what I've ordered
to be facilitated.

31:45.028 --> 31:48.145
My men are here
clearing the wasted.

31:48.323 --> 31:49.438
The dead
are quite inconsiderate

31:49.616 --> 31:51.527
when it comes to those
who are wanting to be alone.

31:51.701 --> 31:54.317
I thought our efforts
would be quiet enough

31:54.495 --> 31:56.656
to fall beneath your notice.

31:56.831 --> 31:59.493
You're the one
who opened the door.

31:59.667 --> 32:01.168
Tripped my wire.

32:01.336 --> 32:02.496
Thought I caught it in time.

32:02.670 --> 32:04.001
Sorry.

32:04.172 --> 32:05.287
You hid them well, lady.

32:05.465 --> 32:06.671
Don't call her "lady."

32:06.841 --> 32:08.547
Ma'am, Ms., missus...

32:08.718 --> 32:10.379
You can shut up now.

32:10.553 --> 32:12.339
Copy.

32:12.513 --> 32:15.129
Goodbye,
Your Majesty.

32:15.308 --> 32:17.344
Jerry: Hold up.

32:19.896 --> 32:23.514
Cobbler.

32:25.151 --> 32:26.857
Kevin said
you like it.

32:27.028 --> 32:29.644
Just in case
you did open the door.

32:35.745 --> 32:38.361
Go.

32:43.503 --> 32:46.336
(door closes)

32:52.720 --> 32:54.881
(sighs)

32:59.894 --> 33:01.725
(knock on door)

33:21.582 --> 33:24.039
(sighs)

33:33.261 --> 33:35.752
(sniffles)

33:35.930 --> 33:38.421
Okay.

33:38.599 --> 33:40.681
Oh.

33:43.604 --> 33:46.767
Jesus took us
to the Kingdom.

33:46.941 --> 33:49.933
Morgan said
you just left.

33:50.111 --> 33:53.444
l was out here.

33:53.614 --> 33:57.573
I saw you.

34:00.163 --> 34:04.202
Why'd you go?

34:11.174 --> 34:13.415
I had to.

34:29.442 --> 34:31.353
I heard something
when I was on watch,

34:31.527 --> 34:33.028
from inside the wall.

34:34.155 --> 34:36.862
I went into the pantry,
one of them jumped me.

34:37.033 --> 34:39.820
She was angry because she didn't
get the supplies from the boat

34:39.994 --> 34:41.734
after all the waiting.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.995
So they made me
pack up everything else.

34:45.416 --> 34:48.283
But she said they were
at the boat, so I hoped...

34:48.461 --> 34:50.827
No.
You didn't just hope.

34:51.005 --> 34:53.667
You got us here.

34:57.678 --> 34:59.930
l was beginning
to lose faith.

35:04.352 --> 35:06.138
But then I saw you.

35:06.312 --> 35:07.347
And you nodded at me.

35:07.522 --> 35:10.605
I mean, just the fact
that you knew I didn't leave,

35:10.775 --> 35:11.890
that you searched
and found me,

35:12.068 --> 35:13.854
that you,
seeing these numbers,

35:14.028 --> 35:15.143
you seemed so...

35:15.321 --> 35:18.404
glad.

35:21.494 --> 35:23.985
We will
set things right.

35:24.163 --> 35:28.702
But things are gonna get
very hard before that time.

35:28.876 --> 35:31.333
We have to hold on.

35:31.504 --> 35:32.994
|wi||.

35:33.172 --> 35:35.254
Thank you.

35:42.598 --> 35:44.850
What made you smile?

35:45.017 --> 35:46.268
(chuckles)

35:46.435 --> 35:50.019
What made you so...
confident?

35:50.189 --> 35:51.895
(chuckles)

35:53.401 --> 35:57.144
Someone showed me
enemies can become friends.

36:00.074 --> 36:02.440
(chuckles)

36:09.750 --> 36:11.411
Rosita: We shouldn't be
going back to Alexandria.

36:11.586 --> 36:12.746
We need to stay out

36:12.920 --> 36:15.206
and look for the guns
for this deal.

36:15.381 --> 36:17.212
Rick is hurt.
Aaron is hurt.

36:17.383 --> 36:19.920
I'm more nervous
about what Eric will say

36:20.094 --> 36:22.585
if he sees my face
like this again.

36:22.763 --> 36:24.264
People back home
need food.

36:24.432 --> 36:27.094
Rick wants to bring supplies
back and we regroup,

36:27.268 --> 36:28.974
so that's
what we're doing.

36:30.062 --> 36:32.974
Then I'll go on my own.

36:36.277 --> 36:39.735
We are sticking together,
and that's it.

36:41.324 --> 36:43.610
What is your problem?

36:43.784 --> 36:46.116
We're not looking
for a fight right now, Rosita!

36:46.287 --> 36:47.743
We're getting ready
for one.

36:47.914 --> 36:51.577
It's always a fight,
Tara.

36:51.751 --> 36:54.618
I'm not letting anyone
get in our way or slow us down.

36:54.795 --> 36:56.626
If we got to stop people
from taking from us

36:56.797 --> 36:58.173
or we got to take
from other people,

36:58.341 --> 37:00.957
I don't care.

37:01.135 --> 37:03.467
We win.

37:03.638 --> 37:05.128
Grow up.

37:08.351 --> 37:10.137
Woman: Guns.

37:10.311 --> 37:11.642
Soon.

37:11.812 --> 37:14.394
Soon.
Orebe.

37:21.530 --> 37:22.565
Michonne: Once we get you
stitched up,

37:22.740 --> 37:24.651
we'll go right back out
and find the guns, right?

37:24.825 --> 37:25.985
That's right.

37:26.160 --> 37:28.492
Do you have
any idea where?

37:28.663 --> 37:32.497
No, but that's never
stopped us before.

37:32.667 --> 37:35.659
Tara, you've been out
further than any of us.

37:35.836 --> 37:37.747
At least you can tell us
where not to look.

37:39.340 --> 37:40.955
Yeah.
(chuckles)

37:41.133 --> 37:42.339
Sure thing.

37:42.510 --> 37:45.217
Rosita:
Let's go already.

37:45.388 --> 37:47.128
Hold-- hold on.

37:55.648 --> 37:58.185
- Why are you...
- (chuckles)

37:58.359 --> 38:00.771
Because we won.

38:02.863 --> 38:04.945
And to replace
the one you lost.

38:08.411 --> 38:09.867
All right?

38:10.037 --> 38:11.948
Let's go.

38:23.759 --> 38:25.841
I couldn't lose anyone.

38:28.222 --> 38:30.429
I couldn't lose
any of them.

38:34.061 --> 38:36.894
I couldn't lose you.

38:43.946 --> 38:45.447
I couldn't kill them.

38:50.077 --> 38:51.988
I could.

38:53.289 --> 38:54.699
lwould.

38:56.459 --> 38:58.290
If they hurt
any of our people--

38:58.461 --> 39:02.079
any more of them--
that's what I would do.

39:07.261 --> 39:11.049
And there wouldn't be
anything left of me after that.

39:21.400 --> 39:23.732
The Saviors--
did they come?

39:25.780 --> 39:27.270
Yeah.

39:46.592 --> 39:48.753
Did anyone get hurt?

39:52.765 --> 39:54.756
ls everybody okay?

39:59.522 --> 40:01.308
(voice breaking)
Did the Saviors...

40:11.534 --> 40:14.446
Is everybody
back home okay?

40:21.502 --> 40:23.242
Daryl...

40:30.177 --> 40:32.042
They came.

40:32.221 --> 40:35.054
We got them all.

40:36.767 --> 40:40.385
Made a deal with
the rest of them, like Ezekiel.

40:40.563 --> 40:41.848
(sobs)

40:42.022 --> 40:44.513
Everyone's all right.

40:44.692 --> 40:47.183
Everyone's all right.

40:47.361 --> 40:49.352
(sniffles)

40:49.530 --> 40:50.986
(sighs)

40:54.660 --> 40:55.991
(clears throat)

40:56.162 --> 40:58.528
We gonna eat or-- or I got to
be a king or something

40:58.706 --> 41:00.196
to get food
around here?

41:00.374 --> 41:01.989
(chuckles)

41:02.168 --> 41:03.704
(sniffles)

41:03.878 --> 41:05.243
Shut up.

41:05.421 --> 41:07.127
(chuckles)

41:19.059 --> 41:20.435
(chuckles)

41:20.603 --> 41:22.013
Ezekiel...

41:22.188 --> 41:23.769
is he okay?

41:26.859 --> 41:28.975
Yeah,
lthink he is.

42:17.201 --> 42:19.112
Watch out for yourself,
all right?

42:38.472 --> 42:41.088
(door creaks)

42:41.267 --> 42:44.600
(Shiva grunting)

42:56.865 --> 42:58.856
Morgan: Well,
you're good with her.

43:01.787 --> 43:04.950
Ezekiel will be impressed.

43:05.124 --> 43:07.331
Well, figure any guy
that has a pet tiger

43:07.501 --> 43:09.116
can't be that bad.

43:11.505 --> 43:13.791
He's okay by Carol.

43:13.966 --> 43:17.174
Yeah, I found her,
out in that little house.

43:17.344 --> 43:20.006
Look, what I said...

43:20.180 --> 43:23.263
when I said she just...

43:25.144 --> 43:26.554
went away...

43:28.314 --> 43:30.270
it's what
she told me to do.

43:30.441 --> 43:31.521
No, I get it.

43:35.029 --> 43:38.692
We need the Kingdom.

43:38.866 --> 43:40.151
You got to
make that happen.

43:43.746 --> 43:45.737
I'm sorry.

43:45.914 --> 43:48.166
I mean, |--

43:48.334 --> 43:49.790
I really am, but, uh...

43:52.379 --> 43:55.086
it can't be me.

43:55.257 --> 43:57.213
(sighs)

43:57.384 --> 44:01.297
Look, whatever it is
you're holding onto...

44:03.682 --> 44:06.549
it's already gone,
man.

44:07.770 --> 44:09.180
Wake the hell up.

44:15.569 --> 44:17.560
You're the same
as me, Daryl.

44:17.738 --> 44:18.898
You don't know shit
about me.

44:19.073 --> 44:20.654
No, I do.

44:22.242 --> 44:26.235
'Cause you didn't tell Carol
what happened.

44:26.413 --> 44:30.156
You didn't,
'cause she'd be here otherwise.

44:31.669 --> 44:33.034
And I'm glad
for that.

44:36.590 --> 44:39.423
See, we're all holding
onto something.

44:39.593 --> 44:41.675
(Shiva grunts)

44:46.600 --> 44:48.716
I'm going back to Hilltop
in the morning

44:48.894 --> 44:50.395
and getting ready.

44:56.944 --> 45:00.937
(music playing)

45:23.429 --> 45:27.263
(music playing)
