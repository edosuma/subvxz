WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:04.667
(Ryan) Previously, on Mech-X4...

00:04.750 --> 00:06.291
(Harris) We can search
the city for Traeger.

00:06.375 --> 00:07.542
We'll shoot him with trackers

00:07.625 --> 00:09.667
and hunt him down
with Ryan and Mech-X4.

00:09.750 --> 00:11.917
You experimented on me as a baby?

00:12.000 --> 00:13.792
I experimented on your birth parents.

00:13.875 --> 00:16.166
Everyone involved was a volunteer.

00:16.250 --> 00:19.000
It's me, Randall.
I know how to track Leo down.

00:19.083 --> 00:21.792
Just go ahead with the plan.
Get Leo.

00:21.875 --> 00:24.041
(boom)

00:24.959 --> 00:26.667
(Grey) Why didn't you end them?

00:26.750 --> 00:29.834
They're mosquitoes.
I can swat them whenever I want.

00:47.041 --> 00:49.792
(alarm blaring)

00:49.875 --> 00:52.792
(indistinct shouts)

00:56.750 --> 00:57.917
Freeze!

01:00.000 --> 01:01.875
-(alarm blaring)
-Hm.

01:04.291 --> 01:06.250
Flesh, and bone.

01:10.458 --> 01:12.000
(yelling)

01:14.959 --> 01:16.750
-(scream)
-(thud)

01:16.834 --> 01:19.333
(yelling)

01:21.208 --> 01:26.125
(theme music playing)

02:01.125 --> 02:04.333
So, this is what little red ooze
we could salvage

02:04.417 --> 02:06.291
from when Gray
was holding Harper.

02:06.375 --> 02:10.083
We've been analyzing it
to help us create a weapon to destroy it.

02:10.750 --> 02:12.041
And bam!

02:13.125 --> 02:15.041
Gohh... That looks explode-y.

02:15.125 --> 02:18.250
Oh! Because it is explode-y.

02:18.333 --> 02:19.417
Hey, hey, hey...

02:19.500 --> 02:21.458
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Easy, tiger.

02:22.333 --> 02:24.709
We figured if we could hit it
with the right frequency,

02:24.792 --> 02:26.709
we could turn it from red ooze...

02:26.792 --> 02:28.250
Do-Do we need one of those?

02:28.333 --> 02:30.625
-Nah, you'll be fine, you're young.
-Okay.

02:31.333 --> 02:33.041
From red ooze...

02:39.417 --> 02:41.583
(coughing)

02:41.667 --> 02:44.875
Ahh. To no ooze.

02:44.959 --> 02:48.000
Traeger's made of red ooze,
so that means no more Traeger.

02:48.083 --> 02:49.458
Nice job.

02:49.542 --> 02:51.375
-I want one.
-We all need one.

02:51.458 --> 02:54.834
Oh... really?
Dang, son, that's too bad,

02:54.917 --> 02:57.125
because, uh, bah-bam!

03:01.625 --> 03:03.083
(chuckles)

03:05.667 --> 03:07.792
Since when did we have a wall
that could spin?

03:07.875 --> 03:10.333
No... Spyder,
the impressive thing is...

03:10.417 --> 03:11.500
Mmm...

03:13.041 --> 03:14.583
I'm so just...

03:14.667 --> 03:15.750
Yeah, okay.

03:15.834 --> 03:17.959
Well, we did it, hey, it's, uh...

03:18.041 --> 03:21.291
-S-S-Sci... Uh, we'll both do it later.
-Yeah, science.

03:21.375 --> 03:22.917
What's important is you did a great job.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.500
-Ow!
-Oh! Sorry.

03:26.166 --> 03:28.208
I'm sure he's still banged up
from the airport fight.

03:28.291 --> 03:29.959
-Oh.
-I'm fine.

03:30.041 --> 03:33.125
Okay. Well, if that's the case,
I'm outta here!

03:33.208 --> 03:35.709
We've been fighting way too many
flying monsters lately,

03:35.792 --> 03:37.583
so I'm gonna go pick up
the last few things we need

03:37.667 --> 03:39.750
to finish the robot's flight mode.

03:39.834 --> 03:41.458
We didn't... We didn't already fly?

03:41.542 --> 03:44.250
No, we sort of just, leap.

03:44.333 --> 03:45.625
-Yeah.
-Leap?

03:45.709 --> 03:47.834
I just... I just thought
we were flying.

03:47.917 --> 03:49.458
No, that's why I...

03:51.333 --> 03:54.792
Yeah. Anyways,
with Harper still out there,

03:54.875 --> 03:57.291
I'm gonna need
to keep a very low profile.

03:57.375 --> 04:00.959
So, if you need me,
my secret name

04:01.041 --> 04:03.959
is Constantine Del Montevideo.

04:04.041 --> 04:04.875
The Third.

04:04.959 --> 04:06.375
Esquire.

04:07.041 --> 04:09.625
Thank you.
Okay. Good luck. Goodbye.

04:09.709 --> 04:12.625
Hello, my name is Constantine,
nice to meet you.

04:12.709 --> 04:14.250
Guys, I was just checking
the sensors,

04:14.333 --> 04:16.500
and it looks like Traeger
is just outside Bay City.

04:16.583 --> 04:19.375
-Why would he be there?
-It doesn't matter.

04:20.834 --> 04:22.333
We have an opportunity.

04:23.041 --> 04:25.750
He's looking for a giant robot,
but with these babies,

04:25.834 --> 04:27.500
we have the element of surprise.

04:27.583 --> 04:29.291
We can take him down.

04:29.375 --> 04:30.959
You guys ready?

04:31.041 --> 04:32.959
-Ready.
-Yeah, give me one of those.

04:35.959 --> 04:38.208
(Leo) Well! Huh...

04:38.291 --> 04:39.959
Hi, there, sir.
Like to sample a bogurt?

04:40.041 --> 04:43.250
Bogurt! Huh, you know I invented
these things, right?

04:43.333 --> 04:47.000
-Oh, really?
-Yeah, just before I was locked up.

04:47.709 --> 04:51.125
Anyways, yogurt plus bagel
equals bogurt!

04:51.208 --> 04:52.542
-It's genius.
-That's the idea.

04:52.625 --> 04:55.417
Of course, I called it a yogel,
and I think that's a far superior name.

04:55.500 --> 04:57.834
-Ehh.
-Yeah, well, we'll agree to disagree.

04:57.917 --> 05:00.208
Anyways, I'll sample your wares,
you only live once, huh? Mm.

05:00.291 --> 05:03.250
Oh! This isn't even toasted.

05:03.333 --> 05:05.875
This is y-yogurt on a bagel.

05:09.291 --> 05:11.709
Keep the yogel.
You never saw me.

05:11.792 --> 05:13.500
Do I have anything on my face?

05:16.583 --> 05:18.000
Ahh...

05:19.291 --> 05:20.458
Bogurt, sir?

05:22.333 --> 05:23.458
Hipsters.

05:42.667 --> 05:44.500
See? Leaping!

05:44.583 --> 05:48.458
Just saying, if you read
the message boards, it says we can fly.

05:49.291 --> 05:50.375
We have message boards?

05:52.792 --> 05:55.500
(Harris) Okay, we're getting closer
to Traeger's location.

05:55.583 --> 05:58.959
But if these readings are right...

05:59.041 --> 06:01.583
it says that he's 20 feet underground?

06:02.917 --> 06:04.417
Which is why we have to go in on foot.

06:04.500 --> 06:06.709
Are you sure you're okay
to go into battle?

06:06.792 --> 06:08.458
-Because...
-Absolutely, son.

06:08.542 --> 06:11.041
Even a one-armed Harris
is still a dangerous man.

06:11.125 --> 06:13.083
-(laughs)
-Nerdo's got guts!

06:14.917 --> 06:16.667
-Respect.
-Ow!

06:34.875 --> 06:36.208
(Mark) Where are we?

06:36.291 --> 06:37.417
(Harris) Don't know.

06:37.500 --> 06:41.083
I think this is some kind
of secret government weapons facility.

06:41.166 --> 06:45.125
I'm scanning high-tech smart weapons,
weird energy signals.

06:45.208 --> 06:46.959
This place is filled with dangerous stuff.

06:47.041 --> 06:48.917
We can't let him leave with any of it.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.750
Yeah, no. But if we save the place,
we can take stuff, right?

06:52.834 --> 06:55.375
Guys, let's take a couple few things.

06:55.458 --> 06:59.875
-(boom)
-Traeger! Let's move!

07:09.542 --> 07:12.625
(alarm buzzing)

07:15.291 --> 07:17.667
(Spyder) Ooh.
Sorry, unconscious dude.

07:20.041 --> 07:21.291
He's fine.

07:21.375 --> 07:23.834
He's out. But he'll live.

07:23.917 --> 07:26.417
(Ryan) They're all still alive.
Now, where's Traeger?

07:26.500 --> 07:28.834
The tracker says that he's right...

07:28.917 --> 07:30.917
-Haah!
-Whoa!

07:31.000 --> 07:33.125
It's me. Spyder?

07:33.208 --> 07:34.333
S-Spyder?

07:35.709 --> 07:37.083
Huh?

07:40.375 --> 07:42.083
Looks like the tracking dart fell off

07:42.166 --> 07:43.834
when he was wiping
the floor with these guys.

07:43.917 --> 07:46.000
No... No offense, beaten up guy.

07:46.709 --> 07:49.208
All right. Let's get hunting.

07:49.291 --> 07:50.417
Oh! (grunts)

07:50.500 --> 07:53.875
Hey, man, why don't you just guard
the entrance while we look for him?

07:53.959 --> 07:56.709
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You are not going to chair me.

07:56.792 --> 07:58.500
I think the term is "bench."

07:58.583 --> 08:02.041
Oh. Am I too busy solving problems
to memorize sports terms?

08:02.125 --> 08:03.750
We don't have time for this.

08:03.834 --> 08:05.417
You do your job, I'll do mine.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.333
Easy, Tiny Justice.
I'm tryin' to look out for you.

08:07.417 --> 08:09.542
Don't "easy" me, Jocko!

08:09.625 --> 08:11.041
-Ow.
-Hey...

08:11.125 --> 08:12.709
I can handle this.

08:12.792 --> 08:14.917
We can cover more space
if we split up.

08:17.083 --> 08:18.500
I'll-I'll go with him.

08:18.583 --> 08:20.375
Go, but, stealthy and quiet.

08:20.458 --> 08:23.583
Those two mean
the exact same thing, but I gotcha.

08:23.667 --> 08:26.458
-Oh-ow-ooh! I'm sorry.
-Stealthy and quiet!

08:26.542 --> 08:28.000
Ssh! Ssh!

08:28.667 --> 08:30.166
(Spyder) I'm being stealthy.

08:30.250 --> 08:34.959
(alarm continues blaring)

08:35.041 --> 08:37.959
-Harris. Harris!
-Shh!

08:38.041 --> 08:40.000
What are you doing
running off without thinking?

08:40.083 --> 08:41.291
That's my thing!

08:41.375 --> 08:43.417
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

08:43.500 --> 08:45.291
No, you're acting crazy.
What's up with you?

08:45.375 --> 08:47.542
Look. I need a win.

08:48.166 --> 08:50.917
I'm the one that lost Grey
when we freed Harper.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.542
If we'd stopped her,
Traeger never would've been born.

08:53.625 --> 08:54.709
This is kinda all on me.

08:54.792 --> 08:56.417
Nobody blames you.

08:56.500 --> 08:57.792
I blame me.

08:58.458 --> 09:02.500
Look, let's just focus
on finding Traeger, okay?

09:05.625 --> 09:08.125
Okay. Okay.

09:31.083 --> 09:33.500
Leo! Come on out.

09:34.709 --> 09:36.667
(man) Come on, I know you're in here.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.583
I just wanna talk.

09:43.667 --> 09:44.917
(shouts)

09:45.875 --> 09:47.166
(grunts)

09:47.250 --> 09:48.375
Ha-ha-ha!

09:48.417 --> 09:50.959
Woo! How do you like that?

09:51.041 --> 09:54.083
So... you're one
of Harper's thugs, huh?

09:54.750 --> 09:56.875
Well, I'm not goin' back
to that underwater prison.

09:56.959 --> 09:59.834
Do you hear me?
Not that prison, not any prison.

09:59.917 --> 10:01.792
You don't understand.

10:01.875 --> 10:03.250
I don't have to.

10:03.333 --> 10:06.041
All you need to understand,
is once this baby recharges,

10:06.125 --> 10:07.417
you're going down
for the long sleep.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.583
Well, that-that sounded
a lot worse than it actually is.

10:12.667 --> 10:14.041
You're just going down for a long nap,

10:14.125 --> 10:16.125
like, five hours,
more of a moderate slumber.

10:16.208 --> 10:18.709
But either way, I'll be long gone.

10:20.291 --> 10:22.709
(coughs)

10:25.458 --> 10:26.792
Aah!

10:26.875 --> 10:28.583
Aah!

10:28.667 --> 10:31.625
Dang it! I was just gettin' used
to sunlight.

10:35.875 --> 10:38.625
-Smoke. Still in the air.
-Yeah.

10:40.041 --> 10:41.792
He was just here.

10:44.917 --> 10:46.500
He still is.

10:48.041 --> 10:49.291
Mark!

10:49.959 --> 10:50.959
Argh!

10:51.041 --> 10:53.959
(grunts)

10:55.375 --> 10:57.875
Interesting.

10:57.959 --> 10:59.542
You are more than human.

10:59.625 --> 11:01.709
I sense power in you.

11:01.792 --> 11:03.542
Why don't you use it to rule?

11:03.625 --> 11:05.041
Why don't you go to a doctor?

11:05.125 --> 11:07.291
You know veins are supposed
to be on the inside, right?

11:07.375 --> 11:10.041
You look like the back
of my grandmother's knees.

11:10.125 --> 11:12.709
Ha... humor.

11:12.792 --> 11:14.709
It doesn't mask your fear.

11:14.792 --> 11:15.959
Yeah!

11:18.542 --> 11:20.291
How do you like me now?

11:23.667 --> 11:26.333
Aargh!

11:34.917 --> 11:36.875
Aah!

11:38.917 --> 11:41.917
What? How?

11:42.000 --> 11:43.291
Science!

11:46.500 --> 11:48.667
-Ahh... Ooh!
-Aah!

11:53.792 --> 11:56.792
(Ryan) I think he went this way.
What's he doing in here?

11:58.458 --> 12:00.041
(Spyder) Something bad?

12:00.125 --> 12:01.834
-(Harris) You think?
-(Ryan) Shh!

12:01.917 --> 12:04.208
That must be what he's here for.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.250
Then we can't let him leave with it.

12:10.834 --> 12:11.834
It's over!

12:13.500 --> 12:16.625
You know our weapons can hurt you,
and you're surrounded.

12:16.709 --> 12:18.083
Just surrender.

12:19.333 --> 12:23.834
You hurt me. I respect that.

12:23.917 --> 12:27.166
I will never underestimate you again,

12:27.250 --> 12:31.291
as you have underestimated me.

12:50.375 --> 12:52.000
(Ryan) He can turn into a monster?

12:52.083 --> 12:54.583
Run! Move! Get to the robot!

12:55.792 --> 12:57.500
(roaring)

12:59.500 --> 13:00.792
(Ryan) Come on!

13:05.625 --> 13:07.000
Hugs, everybody!

13:09.208 --> 13:12.208
Ooh, this is nice.
A little alone time?

13:12.291 --> 13:13.875
Ah, we're good.

13:14.750 --> 13:18.458
Guys, he just ripped out a weapon.
He damaged the whole system.

13:19.250 --> 13:20.417
It's overloading.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.917
If it explodes,
it'll kill everybody in this facility.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.041
All right, I can fix this.

13:24.125 --> 13:25.792
There must be a way to shut down
all the power.

13:25.875 --> 13:30.291
All right, while you figure that out,
we're gonna go fight this monster.

13:48.375 --> 13:51.208
(sigh) Couldn't just be
an off switch, could it?

13:55.542 --> 13:56.834
Come on!

14:13.875 --> 14:16.208
Is it me or does that look
like the beast Harper was piloting?

14:16.291 --> 14:18.625
I don't know, I don't have
long-term memory.

14:18.709 --> 14:20.250
Yes, Spyder, it does!

14:23.875 --> 14:27.250
(roaring)

14:30.792 --> 14:33.458
Aah! The new shields?

14:33.542 --> 14:35.500
Re-routing power to where we need it.

14:37.333 --> 14:39.000
That monster tore through
our regular shield,

14:39.083 --> 14:42.083
but if I pinpoint all our energy
where he's hitting...

14:44.792 --> 14:46.041
it's strong enough to protect us.

14:46.125 --> 14:47.959
Way to bring your "A" game.

14:48.041 --> 14:50.750
-That's a sports term?
-I know what an "A" is.

14:56.709 --> 14:58.250
Mark, how's it going?

14:58.333 --> 15:00.917
(Ryan) Did you find a way
to cut the power?

15:02.250 --> 15:03.792
When in doubt, rip it out.

15:05.458 --> 15:07.166
(laughs)

15:07.250 --> 15:08.625
On my way!

15:09.125 --> 15:10.417
Spyder, let's tear this thing apart!

15:10.500 --> 15:11.583
On it.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.583
Wait, it's protecting a weapon?

15:20.667 --> 15:21.959
-Spyder!
-Break it?

15:22.041 --> 15:22.917
Break it!

15:31.041 --> 15:36.458
(explosions)

15:40.000 --> 15:41.583
(explosions)

15:41.667 --> 15:42.750
Ohh!

15:45.542 --> 15:46.583
Fire!

15:50.750 --> 15:52.417
-Incoming! Shields!
-I got this!

15:57.750 --> 15:59.375
Come on! Come on!

16:04.083 --> 16:05.917
(roaring)

16:06.000 --> 16:07.500
I can't keep up!

16:09.500 --> 16:10.333
Aah...

16:10.417 --> 16:12.542
Harris, what are you doing?

16:12.625 --> 16:13.750
Aah!

16:19.333 --> 16:20.625
Aah!

16:26.834 --> 16:28.417
Aah!

16:29.041 --> 16:30.750
We're completely vulnerable!

16:30.834 --> 16:33.208
I'm trying... I can't move!

16:33.291 --> 16:34.458
Uhh!

16:39.583 --> 16:41.125
(roaring)

16:51.375 --> 16:52.333
(boom)

16:54.166 --> 16:56.166
(alarm ringing)

17:07.709 --> 17:09.125
Oh, man.

17:15.709 --> 17:16.834
Uh...

17:19.208 --> 17:20.458
Dislocated shoulder.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.375
(Harris) Sprained wrist.

17:24.208 --> 17:25.500
Ankle?

17:25.583 --> 17:27.375
Aah! Ankle! Ankle.

17:27.375 --> 17:30.125
Aw, dude. You gonna be okay?

17:30.208 --> 17:34.333
No. We could've won this battle
if I had two good arms.

17:34.959 --> 17:36.208
I'm sorry.

17:36.291 --> 17:38.000
-I let you guys down.
-No, man!

17:38.083 --> 17:40.166
You gave us a way
to track the bad guy,

17:40.250 --> 17:42.041
you gave us weapons to stop him.

17:42.125 --> 17:44.291
And I looted the armory.

17:46.125 --> 17:48.000
Save that for later.

17:48.083 --> 17:50.166
Harris, you gotta stop
beating yourself up.

17:50.250 --> 17:51.792
I get that.

17:51.875 --> 17:54.250
But the stakes are too high
for us to not be operating

17:54.333 --> 17:55.500
at a hundred percent.

17:55.583 --> 17:57.250
So, we'll wait for you to get better.

17:57.333 --> 17:58.625
Yeah, and in the meantime,

17:58.709 --> 18:01.000
we can see what that guy's
gonna do with the weapon.

18:01.083 --> 18:02.667
We can't wait, Ryan.

18:04.250 --> 18:07.250
(sigh) But I know what we can do.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.709
(grunts)

18:12.583 --> 18:13.917
What up, hairbear?

18:14.709 --> 18:18.417
Wow! What kinda math
have you been doing?

18:18.500 --> 18:21.375
Ha! Always hilarious. Got a sec?

18:22.458 --> 18:24.166
Yeah, uh... I'll be out in a bit.

18:24.959 --> 18:26.417
Not gonna invite me in?

18:27.083 --> 18:29.834
Look... this is hard for me.

18:29.917 --> 18:31.709
You and I, we've been rivals since...

18:31.792 --> 18:34.333
Kindergarten. I know.

18:34.417 --> 18:37.542
I still remember getting two more smiles
and a rainbow that you did.

18:37.625 --> 18:39.709
I specifically remember
four unicorns and a star,

18:39.792 --> 18:41.709
but that's not why I'm here.

18:41.792 --> 18:43.417
Ohh.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.500
Oh, no.

18:46.583 --> 18:48.333
This is you askin' me out, isn't it?

18:48.417 --> 18:50.250
-No!
-Really?

18:50.333 --> 18:51.917
The nod to our past.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.291
The big sighs.

18:53.375 --> 18:56.208
The crutches, which is an excellent
sympathy move, by the way.

18:56.291 --> 18:57.291
-Doin' good...
-(groans)

18:57.375 --> 18:58.542
Oh, jeez.
Oh, you're really hurt.

18:58.625 --> 19:02.417
Yep. I just have a dislocated
shoulder, sprained wrist,

19:02.500 --> 19:05.125
-twisted ankle, bruised...
-Yeah, I'm still not going out with you.

19:05.208 --> 19:07.875
-I'm not asking you out!
-Mmm...

19:07.959 --> 19:10.000
I knew I'd have to show you.

19:10.083 --> 19:11.208
Do it.

19:11.375 --> 19:13.417
Who are you talking to?

19:13.500 --> 19:14.959
(boom)

19:15.041 --> 19:16.792
(Veracity) Uh...

19:21.875 --> 19:25.333
Wow. Speechless, that's a first.

19:26.458 --> 19:28.500
Hey, just, uh, do me a favor?

19:28.583 --> 19:30.458
Stand very still.

19:30.542 --> 19:33.041
Why do I have
to stand really still?

19:33.667 --> 19:34.792
(screams)

20:00.750 --> 20:03.709
Welcome to Mech-X4.

20:05.709 --> 20:06.959
No way.

20:08.583 --> 20:09.625
Hi.

20:12.375 --> 20:14.083
(chuckles)

20:15.667 --> 20:18.417
So... what are you gonna
do with me?

20:19.166 --> 20:20.375
Underwater prison?

20:21.166 --> 20:23.709
Bunker underneath
the corporate headquarters?

20:25.834 --> 20:26.875
Panama?

20:26.959 --> 20:29.250
You really don't recognize me, do you?

20:29.333 --> 20:31.125
Why would you?

20:31.208 --> 20:33.166
You used us and threw us away.

20:33.250 --> 20:35.625
Aaron! What's goin' on here?

20:35.709 --> 20:37.583
Is this it? Is this the end?

20:37.667 --> 20:40.500
I never got to meet Michelle Obama,
it's my greatest regret.

20:40.583 --> 20:44.208
-You tied him up?
-He's lucky that's all I did.

20:46.667 --> 20:48.291
I'm sorry about this, Leo.

20:48.875 --> 20:51.583
Randall? Is that you?

20:51.667 --> 20:54.041
Yes. And we need your help.

20:54.125 --> 20:56.458
A few of the people
in your technopathy trial...

20:56.542 --> 20:57.625
there were side effects.

20:57.709 --> 20:59.458
Side effects?

21:00.458 --> 21:03.500
Just... show him.

21:12.125 --> 21:13.417
(groans)

21:15.083 --> 21:17.417
-(coughs)
-He's allergic to technology.

21:17.917 --> 21:20.500
(coughing)

21:20.583 --> 21:23.333
My experiments? They did this?

21:23.417 --> 21:25.291
What... I didn't know...
I didn't mean to...

21:25.375 --> 21:27.041
Nobody cares what you meant.

21:27.125 --> 21:29.917
I'm sick. We all are.

21:30.500 --> 21:31.750
Wait, what?

21:31.834 --> 21:35.792
There are 30 more just like him,
and if you can't cure them, they'll die.

21:37.625 --> 21:43.291
And if that happens...
I promise... so will you.

21:48.250 --> 21:54.500
(theme music playing)

22:13.875 --> 22:15.333
(barks)
