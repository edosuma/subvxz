WEBVTT

00:25.626 --> 00:27.728
'cause this is about
to be a good one.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.164
Down here in New Orleans,
you know we know how to party.

00:30.298 --> 00:31.699
And around here,
we like to say,

00:31.832 --> 00:33.567
"Laissez les
bons temps rouler."

00:35.803 --> 00:38.339
The wait is over.

00:38.472 --> 00:41.342
A sold-out Superdome
is the stage.

00:43.043 --> 00:46.380
After a year
of partially filled
or empty stadiums,

00:46.514 --> 00:49.016
this should be
absolutely electric.

00:49.150 --> 00:51.219
College football's Snickers
National Title game

00:51.352 --> 00:53.087
has finally arrived,

00:53.221 --> 00:55.256
and it is the matchup
of our dreams.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.091
We have the 13-1 Cougars

00:57.225 --> 00:59.460
going against
the undefeated Wolves,

00:59.593 --> 01:02.530
and this is where
legends are made.

01:02.663 --> 01:05.466
[Nick Wright] Wolves
quarterback, the Heisman
Trophy winner LeMarcus James.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.535
Possibly
the best quarterback

01:07.668 --> 01:10.238
to come into the NFL
since Patrick Mahomes.

01:10.371 --> 01:12.706
[reporter] And you know
who agrees with me
on that? Miami.

01:12.840 --> 01:15.243
'Cause they're poised to
take him number one overall,

01:15.376 --> 01:18.246
and I'm hearing for about
$35 million guaranteed.

01:18.379 --> 01:20.047
Meanwhile,
for the Cougars,

01:20.181 --> 01:21.815
you have running back
Cecil Burgess,

01:21.949 --> 01:23.717
AKA the Haitian Hammer.

01:23.851 --> 01:26.120
He's gonna run for,
eh, I don't know,

01:26.254 --> 01:28.822
200 to 400 yards
every game.

01:28.956 --> 01:30.458
That's how he set
the Big 12

01:30.591 --> 01:32.092
all-time single-season
rushing record.

01:32.226 --> 01:34.328
But the people
who really build

01:34.462 --> 01:36.764
the college football
dynasties are the coaches.

01:36.897 --> 01:40.468
We are not talking enough
about Wolves coach
James Lazor.

01:40.601 --> 01:44.104
Everybody knows the guy is
an elite program builder,

01:44.238 --> 01:46.940
one of the best coaches
we've seen,

01:47.074 --> 01:50.010
but he has never
won the big game.

01:50.144 --> 01:53.247
Monday night is about etching
his name in the history books.

01:55.149 --> 01:57.017
[Wright] You have
legacies on the line.

01:57.151 --> 01:59.119
You have controversies
surrounding the sport
as a whole.

01:59.253 --> 02:02.656
Monday cannot get here
soon enough

02:02.790 --> 02:05.793
for the college football
national title game.

02:14.034 --> 02:15.836
[person coughs]

02:15.969 --> 02:17.338
[tapping]

02:17.471 --> 02:18.606
[person sniffs]

02:21.709 --> 02:24.077
[tapping continues
intermittently]

02:31.652 --> 02:33.187
[exhales forcefully]

02:55.643 --> 02:57.378
[person] You hear that?

02:58.446 --> 03:00.281
The poppin'?
[bones popping]

03:03.817 --> 03:07.054
Was an elbow-to-helmet with
Michigan State's Will backer.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.357
I-right, simple, 68 blast.

03:09.490 --> 03:11.091
[football taps]
Wham.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.895
Darn thing
ain't been right since.

03:16.497 --> 03:17.865
[LeMarcus] Lead.

03:18.899 --> 03:19.967
Hmm?

03:20.668 --> 03:22.236
It was 1-41 lead.

03:24.104 --> 03:25.806
Hmm, pretty sure...

03:25.939 --> 03:29.310
If you were
on the second level,
then you were lead blocking.

03:29.443 --> 03:32.546
Michigan State ran
a Chicago 53
with a robber in the box.

03:34.014 --> 03:36.550
I mean, no way you got to
the Will back on the blast.

03:36.684 --> 03:38.185
Hmm?

03:38.319 --> 03:39.920
Could've been lead.

03:44.157 --> 03:45.859
[LeMarcus sighs]

03:52.533 --> 03:56.304
"The path
of the righteous man

03:57.938 --> 04:00.308
is beset on all sides

04:00.441 --> 04:02.310
by the inequities
of the selfish

04:03.477 --> 04:06.113
and the tyranny
of evil men."

04:08.882 --> 04:11.285
"Blessed is he who,
in the name of good will,

04:11.419 --> 04:13.421
shepherds the weak through
the valley of darkness."

04:13.554 --> 04:14.855
Hmm?

04:14.988 --> 04:16.624
"For he is
his brother's keeper

04:16.757 --> 04:18.459
and the finder
of lost children."

04:18.592 --> 04:22.796
"And I will strike them down
with vengeance
and furious anger

04:22.930 --> 04:26.266
those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers."

04:26.400 --> 04:29.670
[both] "And you will know
my name is the Lord,

04:29.803 --> 04:32.706
for I lay my finger
upon thee."

04:33.641 --> 04:35.909
[both imitate gunshots, grunt]

04:38.245 --> 04:40.314
[gasps dramatically]

04:40.448 --> 04:43.150
[both laughing]

04:46.219 --> 04:47.721
You stupid, man.

04:48.822 --> 04:51.058
That was an Oscar-winning
performance.

04:51.191 --> 04:52.593
Shit.

04:52.726 --> 04:55.128
Ah, shit, ol' Quentin
sure can write 'em.

04:55.262 --> 04:56.997
Yeah, he can. [chuckles]

04:58.466 --> 05:00.133
Damn.

05:00.267 --> 05:03.971
Hey, you turn
your location services off?

05:04.905 --> 05:08.041
Yeah. On the iPad too.

05:08.175 --> 05:11.111
We can still call
this whole thing off.

05:11.244 --> 05:13.447
Chalk it up
as a research project.

05:14.915 --> 05:17.017
Get some grad credits
out of it.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.286
Hell, I think we'd be
halfway to our master's.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.721
[scoffs]

05:28.028 --> 05:29.830
Bow your head, man.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.369
[grunts softly]

05:36.704 --> 05:38.839
[LeMarcus sighs]

05:38.972 --> 05:43.811
God, give us the wisdom
to see the path
we must take,

05:43.944 --> 05:45.979
and give us the courage
to brave it.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.782
Make of us a light.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.620
Amen.
Amen.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.891
You're getting better
with that.

06:03.497 --> 06:04.698
[sighs]

06:13.006 --> 06:14.074
[sighs]

06:15.543 --> 06:16.744
We're live.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.652
We'd best
get a move-on then.

06:24.785 --> 06:27.988
Coach's gonna become
a heat-seeking missile
looking for you.

06:28.856 --> 06:29.890
Yeah.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.594
I just hope he understands
this ain't about him.

06:36.497 --> 06:39.199
[commentator on TV]
Burgess, able to break away,

06:39.332 --> 06:41.101
into the secondary.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.336
Breaks another tackle...
Stop right there, Lukie.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.238
[keyboard clacks]
Right there.

06:45.372 --> 06:47.941
This is
what I'm talking about.
Simple stretch sweep to 34.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.943
Lukie, zoom on 34.

06:51.211 --> 06:54.548
There. Right ankle dominant cut
around the left corner.

06:54.682 --> 06:56.383
The best running back
in the country

06:56.517 --> 06:59.252
is turning the corner
on an inside ankle lead.

06:59.386 --> 07:01.989
Why? 34's left ankle
ain't right.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.891
It hasn't been
since week ten.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.860
Okay, real quick.
Cecil scores
on this play, right?

07:06.994 --> 07:09.563
Yeah. Eighty-yard sprint,
where he outruns a free safety.

07:09.697 --> 07:11.899
Yeah, against Vanderbilt,
I could outrun a free safety.

07:12.032 --> 07:15.202
So here's what we do.
If we move Cornelius
to the middle,

07:15.335 --> 07:16.637
we pinch in the OLBs,

07:16.770 --> 07:18.872
we got our safeties thinking
run support first.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.841
Cornelius will
eat his lunch,

07:20.974 --> 07:23.210
and we will shut 34 down
for the night.

07:23.343 --> 07:24.512
I got you.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.947
Boys. Booster club dinner.
Five minutes.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.449
Yeah, yeah, they can wait.
No, they cannot wait.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.384
They're the team owners.
You're the guest of honor.

07:31.519 --> 07:33.353
Luke can babysit the film,
right, baby?

07:33.487 --> 07:35.288
Tell you what. You can
come back here tonight.

07:35.422 --> 07:37.891
You guys can touch
and watch film
all night long. How's that?

07:38.025 --> 07:40.460
Seventy-two hours till
the national goddamn title game,

07:40.594 --> 07:43.063
and I got to parade around
in this dog-and-pony show.

07:43.196 --> 07:45.198
Heavy is the head that wears
the crown, my Lord.

07:45.332 --> 07:47.100
All right, look, I gotta
go get dressed, man,

07:47.234 --> 07:49.436
get ready for this
dog-and-pony show,
as you call it.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.639
Seriously, you're not going
to back me up here at all?

07:51.772 --> 07:53.607
No, I'm not.
I just do your defense.

07:53.741 --> 07:56.443
That's your own offense.
That's your life offense.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.478
[laughs]
Defense right here.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.280
I made these
short and sweet,
like you like it.

08:00.413 --> 08:02.149
I suggest you do the same
with your jokes.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.852
My jokes are hilarious,
and people love them.
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

08:07.287 --> 08:09.489
Stop.
Personal phone.

08:09.623 --> 08:12.192
Give me the personal phone.
Luke gets the business phone.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.027
Give him
the business phone.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.963
Anything comes in,
you know where to find me.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.365
You need to relax.
Let's enjoy the mountaintop.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.368
I'll enjoy the mountaintop
when we are at the mountaintop.
We're not there yet.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.403
Let's go. Can we go?

08:23.537 --> 08:24.872
Yes. Okay.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.640
Lukie, set all staff
for00 a.m.

08:26.774 --> 08:29.309
Bed check on time.
On time.

08:29.442 --> 08:30.711
Will do.

08:32.412 --> 08:34.247
[person]
Bed check. Let's go!

08:34.381 --> 08:36.249
[indistinct chattering]

08:40.453 --> 08:42.522
Hey, guys,
get in y'all room, man.
[knock on door]

08:43.791 --> 08:45.358
-What up, Scotty?
-Yo, what up, Orlando?

08:45.492 --> 08:47.394
Is Walton in there too?
Yeah, he in the bathroom.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.696
Let's get some rest.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.263
Talk to you later, man.
For sure.

08:50.397 --> 08:52.600
[laughing, chattering]
[bottles clink]

08:52.733 --> 08:55.468
Hey, Coach, check them
back there for me.
Sure.

08:56.937 --> 08:58.238
[knocks]

08:58.371 --> 09:00.874
Yo, LJ, Em.
It's Scotty. Open up.

09:03.010 --> 09:05.078
Come on, guys,
stop playing. Open up.

09:24.865 --> 09:26.767
[foil crinkling]

09:31.238 --> 09:33.240
[cell phone ringing]

09:33.373 --> 09:34.775
That's bed check.

09:37.678 --> 09:38.946
Yo, Scotty.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.949
I'm already asleep, man.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.017
Yeah. Sunday's snoring
like an ox.

09:44.151 --> 09:46.253
Can you hear him?
[imitates snoring]

09:47.587 --> 09:49.089
He broke his nose
so many times,

09:49.222 --> 09:51.058
once he gets
on his back,
I'm screwed.

09:51.191 --> 09:54.261
Yeah.00 a.m. sprints
in the bubble.

09:54.394 --> 09:55.629
Got it.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.265
He buy it?
Hell, yeah.

10:03.270 --> 10:06.573
Thank God Snickers sponsored
this game and not
some insurance company.

10:08.241 --> 10:09.242
You hungry?

10:09.376 --> 10:10.577
No.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.581
[sighs]

10:25.092 --> 10:26.927
[laughter]
[Coach Lazor]
I'm telling you,

10:27.060 --> 10:29.730
I know they don't have
boosters this good looking
in the Big 12.

10:29.863 --> 10:32.700
[all laughing]
I know the Cougars
don't look this good.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.336
We have built this program
into a juggernaut.

10:36.469 --> 10:39.206
Two consecutive
conference championships,

10:39.339 --> 10:41.174
two consecutive
play-off berths,

10:41.308 --> 10:43.010
and now...
[audience applauding]

10:43.143 --> 10:45.412
...for the first time
in program history,

10:46.847 --> 10:50.117
we are headed to our first
national title game.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.085
[cheering]

10:54.988 --> 10:56.790
All of you in this room,

10:56.924 --> 10:59.760
you have supported,
pushed and prodded,

10:59.893 --> 11:02.362
and sometimes much,
much worse.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.798
[laughing]
But I appreciate it.

11:04.932 --> 11:07.034
That's how you grow.

11:07.167 --> 11:10.570
And I appreciate the opportunity
to have presided over this,

11:10.704 --> 11:14.507
to help young men
become champions

11:14.641 --> 11:16.777
on and off
the football field.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.245
Go, Pack!

11:18.378 --> 11:20.380
[cheering]

11:22.182 --> 11:24.484
[music playing on speakers]
[indistinct chattering]

11:30.490 --> 11:32.893
You're seriously pressing
your bet again?

11:33.026 --> 11:35.162
Half a million dollars?

11:35.295 --> 11:37.564
Come on, Roger, you know me.
It's for the title.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.167
Go big or go home,
and I ain't fucking leaving.

11:40.300 --> 11:43.370
Well, the apple sure
didn't fall far
from the tree with you.

11:43.503 --> 11:45.538
God bless
your daddy's soul.

11:45.672 --> 11:49.009
Old Fred used to like to
bet the house in Vegas.
[chuckles]

11:49.142 --> 11:51.178
He just liked
the free drinks.
Well, hear, hear.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.580
Question is,
how in the glorious hell

11:53.713 --> 11:55.348
are we gonna stop
Cecil Burgess?

11:55.482 --> 11:57.184
Fastest I seen
since Herschel.

11:57.317 --> 11:58.618
It's me,

11:58.752 --> 12:00.420
I'm flooding the gaps,

12:00.553 --> 12:02.489
bringing Mack
from the strong side

12:02.622 --> 12:05.058
and feeding Cornelius
raw meat till kickoff.

12:05.192 --> 12:07.427
Or we break in his room
and Tonya Harding
that son of a bitch.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.930
Now, aren't you sweet?
[chuckles]

12:10.063 --> 12:11.932
Well, as long as we got
LeMarcus back there

12:12.065 --> 12:14.234
firing bullets,
we'll be fine--
better than fine.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.870
Coach, we was just talking
about LeMarcus.

12:17.004 --> 12:18.171
LeMarcus who?

12:18.305 --> 12:19.706
[laughter]
But I'll tell you what,

12:19.840 --> 12:22.075
he was pretty raw
when we found him,

12:22.209 --> 12:26.179
and obviously, he's
developed into something
really, really special.

12:26.313 --> 12:29.616
You think you can convince him
he ain't ready to jump
for another year?

12:29.749 --> 12:31.952
I'm just gonna support
whatever is best for LeMarcus.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.854
[Rodger] Amen.
[Taylor] Coach,
I got a kid in Little Rock.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.923
Hell of an arm. Got to show
you some videos of him.

12:36.056 --> 12:38.725
[Coach Lazor] Love to see it.
You remember
the bad old days

12:38.859 --> 12:40.794
when we were scraping
the bottom of the barrel,

12:40.928 --> 12:44.431
begging JUCO transfers
with cases of Budweiser

12:44.564 --> 12:46.066
and jobs
with the dealership?

12:46.199 --> 12:48.101
[Coach Lazor]
Yeah, all too well.

12:48.235 --> 12:50.303
[Taylor] And all that changed
once you got LeMarcus.
[Rodger] Bullshit.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.339
All that changed
when we got Coach here.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.274
Hey, Coach.
Kevin McDonald.
Hi, Kevin.

12:54.407 --> 12:55.809
Director of Communication
for the CFP.

12:55.943 --> 12:57.544
Good to meet you,
and thanks for everything.

12:57.677 --> 13:01.014
Sure. Uh, we may have
a situation.

13:01.148 --> 13:04.317
LeMarcus just tweeted this
earlier tonight.

13:05.718 --> 13:08.421
It says he's boycotting
the game.

13:08.555 --> 13:11.091
Reporters are
already swarming.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.793
We're trying to keep them
off the players' floor.

13:13.927 --> 13:16.596
Can probably do that
till morning,

13:16.729 --> 13:18.665
but this can get
out of hand fast.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.433
It won't.
Give me 20 minutes.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.476
Guys, I'll see you right back.
[chuckles]

13:40.753 --> 13:41.889
Hey.

13:43.290 --> 13:44.657
Hi.

13:46.026 --> 13:48.395
A poet at a football game.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.865
Philosopher
at a football game.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.134
[both chuckle]
Anyway...

13:57.204 --> 13:58.939
You look fantastic.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.709
[chuckles]

14:02.842 --> 14:05.812
Scotty, we sure
this is the room?
Yeah, Coach.

14:05.946 --> 14:08.181
Okay, and they were here
at bed check?

14:08.315 --> 14:10.683
Yeah, they're marked off.
What the fuck does that mean,
"They're marked off"?

14:10.817 --> 14:13.220
Did somebody see 'em?
No. But I spoke to LJ
on the phone.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.288
What the fuck?
You ain't seen nobody...

14:15.422 --> 14:17.357
You don't do bed check
on the goddamn telephone.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.426
You check the goddamn bed.
For Christ's sake.

14:19.559 --> 14:22.229
Goddamn it!
Bailey's got my phone.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.497
Your work one.
Yes. Thank you.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.599
Jesus Christ, man.
We're in New Orleans.

14:26.733 --> 14:29.469
Walking distance
to the Quarter
with LeMarcus James.

14:29.602 --> 14:33.273
You might want to actually check
that he's in bed at bed check.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.542
When's the last time
did y'all see him?
Come on, now.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.710
Huh?
When he got off the bus.

14:37.844 --> 14:40.513
Hey, LeMarcus, it's Coach.
Just hit me back here
on the work cell, okay?

14:40.647 --> 14:42.349
If you're out and about,
no problem.

14:42.482 --> 14:44.384
Just, uh, checking in, okay?

14:44.517 --> 14:46.253
We'll see you
for a.m. sprints, man.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.421
Goddamn it.
There's the guy
with the key, Coach.

14:48.555 --> 14:49.957
I'm sorry.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.424
All right.

14:52.659 --> 14:53.826
[sighs]

14:53.961 --> 14:55.495
LeMarcus. Emmett.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.566
Goddamn it.

14:59.699 --> 15:01.601
What the...

15:01.734 --> 15:05.438
Well, I guess we just knock
on every goddamn door
at the hotel.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.674
We got to find him.
Let's go. Go, go, go.

15:07.807 --> 15:09.576
Wake everybody up
if you have to.

15:09.709 --> 15:11.011
Shit.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.813
[indistinct conversations]

15:21.921 --> 15:25.358
[Coach Dunn]
Come on, Cornelius,
open up the door. Hey.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.927
Fuck. Hold on.
[bottle clinks]

15:29.196 --> 15:30.763
What do you want, Coach?

15:32.432 --> 15:34.434
What the fuck
is that smell?

15:34.567 --> 15:36.769
That's Payton's ass
after Popeyes.

15:38.071 --> 15:41.141
There something you need?
Look, have you
seen LeMarcus?

15:41.274 --> 15:43.143
Why the fuck
would I know where he's at?

15:43.276 --> 15:45.412
What's going on?
It's nothing for you
to worry about.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.414
Just be ready for sprints
in the morning.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.482
Nasty-ass kids.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.368
[LeMarcus] Yo, Orlando.

16:11.404 --> 16:12.972
How drunk are you, man?

16:13.973 --> 16:15.942
I haven't drank
in four months.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.177
Where's your phone?

16:17.310 --> 16:19.912
In the room, like you asked.

16:20.047 --> 16:22.015
But what the fuck
is this, LJ?

16:22.849 --> 16:24.817
It's exactly what I said.

16:24.951 --> 16:26.753
I ain't playing
until they pay us.

16:26.886 --> 16:28.488
What? You broke again?

16:28.621 --> 16:31.058
You hurt?
I'm done.

16:31.191 --> 16:34.161
They're here making billions
while the rest of us
make scraps.

16:34.294 --> 16:38.131
Me and you, we could sell
our names. What about
everybody else, huh?

16:39.166 --> 16:41.068
Whoa. Wait, wait, wait.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.136
Hold up, hold up.

16:44.937 --> 16:47.174
So you gonna sit
the national title game

16:47.307 --> 16:49.442
so some punt-coverage
Wayne Burnett gets...

16:49.576 --> 16:52.112
A real piece, yeah.
[chuckles]

16:53.613 --> 16:54.847
Shit.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.685
LJ, you need
to think about this, bruh.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.520
You and crazy-
Bible-Belt-Sunday

17:00.653 --> 17:02.355
gonna get laughed
out the building.

17:02.489 --> 17:04.691
And if you're lucky, what?
You gonna post on Twitter,

17:04.824 --> 17:08.161
and the whole fucking
machine gonna go,
"Okay, okay. We give up.

17:08.295 --> 17:11.531
LeMarcus doesn't want to play.
Let's just make him happy."

17:11.664 --> 17:14.901
I ain't who you think I am.
[scoffs]

17:15.034 --> 17:18.905
So you weren't the one
who gave us all 'Rona

17:19.038 --> 17:22.175
after fucking
half the campus
during quarantine?

17:22.309 --> 17:24.111
You ain't tested
with your own piss
in three years.

17:24.244 --> 17:27.680
All your cash going up in smoke
or to that shit in your ears.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.716
So you standing on stage
for one protest

17:29.849 --> 17:32.152
for Instagram and pussy

17:32.285 --> 17:34.354
don't make you Malcolm X,
brother.

17:34.487 --> 17:37.224
Ain't nobody marching
in the streets

17:37.357 --> 17:39.226
for the number one pick.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.528
[sighs]

17:44.164 --> 17:47.033
Look, man,
you're a great quarterback--

17:47.167 --> 17:48.701
and I'm gonna keep it 100
with you:

17:48.835 --> 17:50.270
one of the best
I've ever seen.

17:50.403 --> 17:51.938
But this shit?

17:54.307 --> 17:55.475
Uh-uh.

17:56.843 --> 17:58.645
You gonna embarrass
yourself, bruh.

18:01.948 --> 18:04.451
Look, man, you ain't
gotta come with me.

18:04.584 --> 18:07.420
All I'm asking is that
you don't come out against me.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.457
[sighs]

18:13.193 --> 18:14.461
All right.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.496
I'll watch this show
as long as you want,

18:16.629 --> 18:18.731
but I ain't gettin'
a hundred yards from it.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.510
Good luck.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.120
[country music playing
on speaker]

18:41.254 --> 18:43.256
[heavy breathing]

18:56.903 --> 18:59.672
Mmm, I cannot believe
that you are here,

18:59.806 --> 19:01.140
you little sneak.

19:01.274 --> 19:02.642
[chuckles]

19:02.775 --> 19:04.944
You know
you love surprises.

19:05.077 --> 19:06.979
I do. I do.

19:07.113 --> 19:08.615
I just...

19:08.748 --> 19:11.184
I just wish you had a seat
next to me at the game.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.353
That's not exactly
the reason I came.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.888
[laughs]
Fine by me.

19:17.290 --> 19:18.691
[sighs]

19:21.661 --> 19:23.296
I'm gonna take the job.

19:24.397 --> 19:26.299
Get a break
from the university.

19:28.568 --> 19:29.669
Rome?

19:31.204 --> 19:34.140
Hard to turn down
a year teaching abroad.

19:34.274 --> 19:35.908
Yeah.

19:36.042 --> 19:39.145
Yeah, I get that.
I totally get that.

19:41.781 --> 19:46.219
I just had one little,
tiny little question,
Mr. Poet.

19:48.721 --> 19:51.224
Or is it "philosopher"?

19:51.358 --> 19:54.394
What about us?

19:55.795 --> 19:57.730
We're a hotel-room
romance.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.399
Well, now you're just
being a dick.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.868
You know
what I'm saying.
Fuck you.

20:02.001 --> 20:03.436
Come visit.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.905
"Come visit." Grazie.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.741
[chuckles]

20:14.113 --> 20:15.482
I don't know.

20:17.484 --> 20:19.018
Maybe I want more.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.237
[coughs]

20:39.339 --> 20:40.673
[sniffles]

20:42.509 --> 20:43.610
You all right?

20:44.511 --> 20:45.912
Fucking nerves, man.

20:47.213 --> 20:48.715
Just breathe through it.

20:50.683 --> 20:53.320
You got this.
You're fresh as ever.

21:04.431 --> 21:07.334
Habibi, this is a long way
to Frenchmen Street.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.636
Yeah, we like taking in
the sights, Ned.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.738
[Ned] Okay. Your money.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.873
[coughing]

21:40.600 --> 21:43.002
We're sure
walking the talk now.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.837
What, you want out?

21:44.971 --> 21:46.773
Shit, I'm going
back to the farm.

21:46.906 --> 21:49.175
You're the one who's got
everything to lose.

21:49.976 --> 21:51.177
[sighs]

21:51.310 --> 21:53.145
Glad we huddled
up on that.

21:54.781 --> 21:58.317
Keep her running, Ned.
We may have to dine and dash.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.088
[grunts]

22:03.155 --> 22:04.891
LeMarcus, Cathy Levy.
Nice to meet you.

22:05.024 --> 22:07.460
Yeah, nice to meet you.
This is Em.
Are you okay?

22:07.594 --> 22:10.697
Peachy, yeah. Just, uh,
ankle gets a little stiff
if I sit too long.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.298
Thanks for agreeing
to do this.

22:12.432 --> 22:14.501
Are you kidding?
Thanks for calling.

22:14.634 --> 22:17.336
[indistinct chattering]

22:19.005 --> 22:21.541
Whenever you're ready,
go ahead and take
a seat for me.

22:22.675 --> 22:23.843
Holy shit.

22:25.778 --> 22:27.647
Damn, you look good
ten stories high.

22:27.780 --> 22:30.216
Just had to put that
in the background, huh?

22:33.453 --> 22:34.854
Here goes nothing.

22:34.987 --> 22:36.355
Go get 'em.

22:40.827 --> 22:42.429
Wait, wait.

22:46.766 --> 22:48.401
[sighs]
[Cathy] You ready?

22:49.335 --> 22:50.970
We're recording.

23:01.147 --> 23:02.749
[coughs, clears throat]

23:04.116 --> 23:05.317
[sniffles]

23:05.452 --> 23:07.687
"I'm personally asking
all players

23:07.820 --> 23:09.556
in Monday's
national title game

23:09.689 --> 23:11.791
to join me in this protest

23:11.924 --> 23:13.526
and resulting boycott,

23:13.660 --> 23:16.228
in order to demand that
the NCAA and its affiliates

23:16.362 --> 23:19.866
end their practice
of unpaid labor for the
majority of their workforce,

23:19.999 --> 23:24.704
a practice which results
in $18.9 billion a year
in total revenue

23:24.837 --> 23:26.606
for a system which,
in turn,

23:26.739 --> 23:30.076
only spends $3.6 billion
on athletic scholarships."

23:31.410 --> 23:35.281
Where does the other 15-plus
billion dollars go, you ask?

23:35.414 --> 23:36.883
Well, I'll tell you:

23:37.016 --> 23:39.218
to an extremely lucrative
oligarchy.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.221
"The president of the NCAA

23:42.354 --> 23:45.458
received a salary
of $3.9 million last year.

23:45.592 --> 23:47.927
The commissioners
of the top five
power conferences

23:48.060 --> 23:51.197
receive an average salary
of $4 million each year.

23:51.330 --> 23:53.232
The latest ESPN contract
for TV rights

23:53.365 --> 23:54.834
to the college football
play-offs

23:54.967 --> 23:58.471
is $7.3 billion
over the next 12 years."

23:58.605 --> 24:02.875
That's over $600 million
a year for three games.

24:03.009 --> 24:06.078
That's the reason
they're expanding
the play-offs to 12 games.

24:08.715 --> 24:09.816
[sighs]

24:12.218 --> 24:15.287
My coach, James Lazor,

24:15.421 --> 24:17.924
receives an annual salary
of $5 million,

24:18.057 --> 24:20.459
plus up to a million dollars
in on-the-field bonuses,

24:20.593 --> 24:22.829
including
the national title game.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.831
You see, all of this money

24:24.964 --> 24:28.167
is predicated on one
underlying principle:

24:29.168 --> 24:30.970
free labor.

24:31.103 --> 24:33.105
It is un-American,
it is exploitative,

24:33.239 --> 24:35.942
and it speaks
to the darkest spots
in the national soul.

24:36.075 --> 24:39.779
Now, it is not enough
for some of us to be able
to use our name and likeness,

24:39.912 --> 24:42.849
which, make no mistake,
costs them nothing.

24:42.982 --> 24:45.117
So our demands
are as follows:

24:46.586 --> 24:48.154
"One,

24:48.287 --> 24:50.489
the creation
of non-revocable,
player-controlled trusts

24:50.623 --> 24:52.759
for every Division I
varsity athlete.

24:52.892 --> 24:55.261
Number two,
the NCAA will form

24:55.394 --> 24:57.697
and contribute
to a player's
disability pension

24:57.830 --> 24:59.365
for Division I athletes

24:59.498 --> 25:01.568
who are injured
from college athletics."

25:01.701 --> 25:03.803
Shit.
"And number three,

25:03.936 --> 25:05.805
the NCAA will
officially recognize

25:05.938 --> 25:08.174
and collectively bargain
with the players' union,

25:08.307 --> 25:11.477
submitting to all
federally mandated laws
and guidelines

25:11.611 --> 25:13.746
of a unionized workforce."

25:13.880 --> 25:17.750
In this, the NCAA
will recognize players

25:17.884 --> 25:21.187
as employees
and not student athletes.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.190
Thank you.

25:27.159 --> 25:28.194
[sighs]

25:39.105 --> 25:41.240
[clears throat, sniffles]

25:41.373 --> 25:44.176
He said he'd be
right over, so...

25:44.310 --> 25:45.578
[smacks lips]

25:45.712 --> 25:47.847
Got a lot on his plate.

25:47.980 --> 25:49.448
[door opens]

25:49.582 --> 25:50.883
Hey, there he is.

25:51.017 --> 25:52.885
All right.
Good morning, Coach.

25:53.019 --> 25:56.656
Thanks for coming over
so quick. This is
Wes Martin from the Big 12.

25:56.789 --> 25:58.958
He's gonna be our enemy for
the next 48 hours.
[chuckles]

25:59.091 --> 26:01.460
-Kevin McDonald from the CFP.
-We met yesterday.

26:01.594 --> 26:05.131
And Mike Titus, Senior VP,
Championships, D-I football.

26:05.264 --> 26:06.699
James, we've actually met.

26:06.833 --> 26:09.035
Yeah, at the Outback Bowl
two seasons ago.

26:09.168 --> 26:12.071
That's right.
You have come a long way.
Looks like you have too.

26:12.204 --> 26:14.907
[chuckles] Yes, indeed.
Please have a seat.

26:15.041 --> 26:16.809
Real, uh...

26:16.943 --> 26:19.779
Real mess we got here.
[Coach Lazor]
Well, not really.

26:19.912 --> 26:22.248
I just need to
get with LeMarcus
and talk things through.

26:22.381 --> 26:24.784
These kids don't
fully understand
what they're doing.

26:24.917 --> 26:27.186
A coach and his quarterback.
No closer bond.

26:27.319 --> 26:30.623
You were
a quarterback yourself
back in the day, am I right?

26:30.757 --> 26:32.925
Coaches are just players
who can't play anymore.

26:33.860 --> 26:35.427
You still don't know
where he is?

26:35.561 --> 26:37.563
What?
[Kevin]
Where LeMarcus is.

26:37.697 --> 26:40.199
We're broadcasting this game
in 160 countries.

26:40.332 --> 26:42.802
They're all tuning in
to watch him go
against Cecil Burgess.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.604
I love these marketing guys.
You know that LeMarcus and Cecil

26:45.738 --> 26:48.440
both play offense,
so they won't be facing off.

26:48.574 --> 26:51.443
I know how
the game works, Coach.
Look, LeMarcus is around.

26:51.577 --> 26:53.212
He's probably
in the hotel somewhere.

26:53.345 --> 26:55.447
I just haven't had a chance
to get with him yet.

26:57.850 --> 27:01.353
Coach, I think it's best
if the NCAA took
the reins here.

27:01.487 --> 27:03.923
We're more of an impartial jury.
We just want a great game.

27:04.056 --> 27:06.859
Well, I think that's what
all of us want, right?
Yes, it is.

27:06.993 --> 27:10.730
That's why we were hoping
you could shed some light
on this young man.

27:10.863 --> 27:12.999
LeMarcus.
What's his character?

27:13.132 --> 27:14.901
He's a good kid.

27:15.034 --> 27:18.004
He's just, uh--
Like a lot of kids his age,

27:18.137 --> 27:20.940
maybe he's a little too fond
of the spotlight and its perks.

27:21.073 --> 27:23.843
Hell, if I was
the best QB in the country,
I think I'd be bouncin' 'em

27:23.976 --> 27:26.445
out of my apartment
three at a time, huh?

27:26.578 --> 27:29.415
[Coach Lazor] LeMarcus
is not a troublemaker, okay?

27:29.548 --> 27:33.485
I want to be
very clear on this.
LeMarcus is a good person.

27:34.553 --> 27:37.790
He's just a kid
with too much power

27:37.924 --> 27:40.492
who, I don't know,
had a bad tweet.

27:40.626 --> 27:43.095
-And interview.
-[person clears throat]
Okay.

27:43.229 --> 27:45.531
Well, you know,
Coach is gonna right
this ship.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.499
He just needs
a little more time, right?
[Coach Lazor] Yep.

27:47.633 --> 27:50.903
-[Kevin] You think
somebody got to him?
-"Somebody"?

27:51.037 --> 27:53.840
Like an organized labor rep,
an ACLU lawyer?

27:53.973 --> 27:55.507
Maybe the Russians.

27:57.309 --> 28:00.012
That's a fucking joke, guys.
Huh. Come on, guys.

28:00.146 --> 28:03.182
Look, LeMarcus, from sixth,
seventh grade on,

28:03.315 --> 28:05.084
they're big men on campus.

28:05.217 --> 28:07.887
He and Emmett,
they still think
this is playtime here.

28:08.020 --> 28:09.989
They don't understand
the world stage.

28:10.122 --> 28:12.158
They don't understand
the implications here.

28:12.291 --> 28:13.826
They just asked
to collectively bargain.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.195
They want to destroy
the student-athlete
designation.

28:16.328 --> 28:18.865
Not the demands of some kids
spitting in the wind.

28:18.998 --> 28:20.399
You telling me I don't
know my own players?

28:20.532 --> 28:22.068
I'm saying
you might be in denial

28:22.201 --> 28:23.770
about what is actually
happening right now.

28:23.903 --> 28:25.604
Come on, Wes.
That's over the line.

28:25.738 --> 28:27.673
[Wes] Is it?
Yes, it is.

28:27.807 --> 28:30.576
Coach, what they're
asking for is bigger
than football or one game.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.144
Understood.
It's our entire
amateur athletics program

28:32.278 --> 28:33.813
in the country.

28:33.946 --> 28:37.750
That's 24 sports
for young men and women,
gone.

28:37.884 --> 28:40.286
Hundreds of thousands
of students,

28:40.419 --> 28:41.720
student athletes,

28:41.854 --> 28:44.423
being denied
a college experience.

28:44.556 --> 28:47.726
[Kevin]
We're 40-somethin' hours
to kickoff here, guys.

28:47.860 --> 28:49.661
We need to make sure
everybody's suiting up.

28:49.796 --> 28:51.798
There hasn't been a single
defection from our side.

28:51.931 --> 28:53.800
It's theirs
that's falling apart.
[cell phone chimes]

28:53.933 --> 28:55.902
Hey. Nothing's
falling apart.

28:56.035 --> 28:58.004
Okay? Everybody relax
a little bit.

28:58.137 --> 29:00.773
-[Wes] Three wide receivers
just tweeted, "We're in."
-[men sighing]

29:00.907 --> 29:04.276
With a hashtag that's going
viral: "Fix the system."

29:04.410 --> 29:07.947
Your other two stars,
Bishop and Cornelius,
could be next.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.616
Orlando Bishop
is my one and only captain.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.419
He is team first.
He's not going anywhere.

29:13.552 --> 29:16.688
And Cornelius, frankly,
can't stand LeMarcus.

29:16.823 --> 29:19.225
He wouldn't follow him
into the Garden of Eden.
He'll play.

29:19.358 --> 29:23.462
One linebacker
ain't plugging this hole.
You're taking on water fast.

29:23.595 --> 29:25.932
Hey! He got blindsided
just like the rest of us,
all right?

29:26.065 --> 29:28.334
There's no reason
to keep attacking him.

29:28.467 --> 29:30.236
Here's an idea.

29:30.369 --> 29:33.472
Lean on the sophomores
and freshmen who have
something to lose.

29:33.605 --> 29:36.242
They won't want to risk
the eligibility over this.

29:37.143 --> 29:38.911
You'd love that,
wouldn't you, Wes?

29:39.045 --> 29:41.613
We all know I can't field
a competitive team

29:41.747 --> 29:44.483
with a bunch of 18-year-olds
that haven't played

29:44.616 --> 29:47.119
a meaningful snap
since high school.

29:47.253 --> 29:50.056
Fuck that. I'd rather not
field a team at all.

29:51.457 --> 29:53.759
I'm afraid
that's not an option.

29:57.830 --> 30:00.833
We wouldn't need any options
if I could get with
my quarterback

30:00.967 --> 30:04.003
instead of sitting around
this circle jerk.

30:06.205 --> 30:08.207
[clears throat]
Thanks for coming, Coach.

30:08.340 --> 30:09.641
You bet.

30:10.776 --> 30:13.212
-Thanks for coming down.
-Don't lecture my guy.

30:13.345 --> 30:16.315
Thought you had your conference
under control, Everly.
We got nothin'.

30:16.448 --> 30:19.185
-[Everly] We got time.
-[Wes] Time is the one thing
we don't have.

30:19.318 --> 30:21.687
[Everly]
We got a little bit.
We'll be fine.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.362
All right.
The Death Star awaits.

30:30.496 --> 30:32.498
The Cougars are staying
on the 17th floor.

30:32.631 --> 30:34.133
There's a stairway
around the back.

30:34.266 --> 30:35.935
Let's go get this done
and get out of here.

30:36.068 --> 30:38.004
Keep it running, Ned.
We'll be back in 20.

30:38.137 --> 30:40.172
[hip-hop music playing]
[person] Eat, nigga, eat!

30:40.306 --> 30:42.341
[knock on door]
I'm nice. I'm nice.

30:42.474 --> 30:45.978
Watch this bucket
right here. Bucket!
[pounding on door]

30:46.112 --> 30:47.146
Hold on.

30:47.279 --> 30:48.981
Hey, don't fuckin' cheat.

30:51.083 --> 30:53.152
Hello, Roc.
Emmett Sunday, esquire.

30:54.120 --> 30:56.022
You may know me
from such hits

30:56.155 --> 30:57.890
as Last Stand
at the Texas Stadium,

30:58.024 --> 30:59.825
Destruction
at the Peach Bowl...
That's not funny.

30:59.959 --> 31:02.294
I'm number 82.
Yeah, the tight end.
What the fuck do you want?

31:02.428 --> 31:04.530
The one and only.
Mind if I come in
for a sec? Thanks.

31:04.663 --> 31:06.465
Hold on. You just gonna
walk in my room like that?

31:06.598 --> 31:08.500
Cecil, what's going on, man?
Emmett Sunday. How you doing?

31:08.634 --> 31:11.270
Just gonna turn on--
Why you turning
on my light like that?

31:11.403 --> 31:14.373
-I'm just gonna
turn off this TV.
-Yo, white boy. [sighs]

31:14.506 --> 31:17.843
Chill out and let me know
why the fuck you in my room
before I fight you.

31:17.977 --> 31:20.146
Cecil, you mind
if I show you something
for a second?

31:20.279 --> 31:22.181
-It may help make my case.
-All right, man, go ahead.

31:22.314 --> 31:24.250
He's been replying
real quick. Hold on.

31:24.383 --> 31:26.552
Yeah, there you go.
Hold on.

31:26.685 --> 31:28.587
Nah, nah, nah.
This way first.

31:30.522 --> 31:33.225
Get the fuck out of here.
I ain't fucking with you.

31:33.359 --> 31:35.427
Yo, this is LeBron, nigga.
Look.
That's LeBron.

31:35.561 --> 31:37.396
LeBron DM'd these fucks.
That's the king.

31:37.529 --> 31:39.431
Oh, shit! He just said
"What's up?" to you.

31:39.565 --> 31:41.033
Yeah, 'cause
he knows you're here.

31:41.167 --> 31:43.235
How the fuck you get
LeBron to DM you?

31:43.369 --> 31:45.104
We're buddies, man.
And I was thinking,

31:45.237 --> 31:47.206
Clutch just started
a new football division
to rep,

31:47.339 --> 31:50.676
and I was thinking, hell,
maybe I just put in
a good word for you two.

31:50.809 --> 31:54.380
Fly over to LA,
the land of big lips,
fake tits, and sunshine.

31:54.513 --> 31:56.282
I love fake titties.
I know. Me too.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.717
And you sit down
with LeBron and Maverick
and have a conversation.

31:58.850 --> 32:02.454
Grab lunch with LeBron in LA?
You know I love tacos, nigga.
Hold on. How we do that?

32:02.588 --> 32:04.856
It's a little weird.
I need your phones.

32:04.991 --> 32:06.892
-My phone?
-I just need your phone.

32:08.860 --> 32:11.563
Fuck it.
Hey, it's LeBron. Here.

32:11.697 --> 32:13.765
Come on,
give him your phone.
Come on, Cecil.

32:13.899 --> 32:16.302
I ain't gonna do
anything weird with it.
Come on.

32:16.435 --> 32:17.970
You can keep my phone
as collateral.

32:18.104 --> 32:20.639
Collateral and shit.
I'ma pocket this bitch.

32:20.772 --> 32:21.807
Don't move.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.410
Yeah. Yeah.

32:24.543 --> 32:26.778
Bruh, LeBron.
LeBron, though.
[Emmett whistles]

32:26.912 --> 32:28.514
What's happening, fellas?

32:29.481 --> 32:32.151
Surprise, surprise.
Shit.

32:32.284 --> 32:35.454
-Not LeBron.
-So, what's up?
I know y'all seen it.

32:35.587 --> 32:37.789
Yeah, we seen it.
[LeMarcus]
What y'all think?

32:37.923 --> 32:39.825
Hoping y'all gonna join us.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.561
And skip out
on the title game?

32:42.694 --> 32:43.962
Man, you out
your fucking mind.

32:44.096 --> 32:46.032
[Roc] For real.
[LeMarcus] Yeah, probably.

32:46.165 --> 32:48.267
It's gonna take
a little crazy to get
it done though, ain't it?

32:48.400 --> 32:51.170
Yeah, but he's Kiper's
number one back.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.105
Going eighth to Baltimore
at the latest.

32:53.239 --> 32:55.307
He ain't risking that
fucking with y'all.

32:55.441 --> 32:57.409
Hmm. Buffalo should
take him at three.

32:57.543 --> 33:00.379
-They're going tackle.
-Maybe Miami gets smart
and takes you at one.

33:00.512 --> 33:03.715
-Then where you gonna go?
-Me? Shit.
CFL after this, probably.

33:03.849 --> 33:05.451
-[snorts]
-[LeMarcus chuckles]

33:05.584 --> 33:07.353
Yeah, Saskatchewan
or some shit like that.

33:07.486 --> 33:10.256
[Roc] Saskatchewan?
Listen.

33:10.389 --> 33:13.292
They're still gonna find
a way to play this game
without me and Emmett.

33:14.493 --> 33:16.128
We gonna need you.

33:16.262 --> 33:18.464
The Haitian Hammer,
running wild on all those
TV promos.

33:18.597 --> 33:21.400
Come watch him put up
500 yards in a single game.
Hell, I'd go to see it.

33:21.533 --> 33:23.135
Yeah, maybe then he goes
number one.

33:23.269 --> 33:25.371
But if he sits, they gonna
Kaepernick him like you.

33:25.504 --> 33:28.040
Hmm.
Come on, bruh. You might
fall out the first round.

33:28.174 --> 33:30.476
Do y'all even know
what the rookie minimum
is down there?

33:30.609 --> 33:33.979
Probably not, but they
taking backs in the third
or fourth round nowadays.

33:34.113 --> 33:35.547
Four years and done,
we're back in the hood.

33:35.681 --> 33:38.450
That is why we gotta stick
together on this, fellas.

33:38.584 --> 33:40.486
Think about it.

33:40.619 --> 33:42.154
If we all sit,
what are they gonna do?

33:42.288 --> 33:45.391
Hmm? It's called
collective action.

33:45.524 --> 33:47.659
Fuck you learn
a big word like that?

33:48.727 --> 33:50.162
Intro to Organized Labor.

33:50.296 --> 33:53.365
[scoffs] A class?
He talking 'bout a class.

33:53.499 --> 33:56.902
[chuckles] Only class
you probably took was Intro
to Organized Dick-sucking.

33:57.035 --> 33:59.538
-Flap your gums
'cause you're scared.
-Scared of what? You?

33:59.671 --> 34:01.507
Scared you're gonna be
teaching high-school PE
next year.

34:01.640 --> 34:02.941
I know this is my last game,
same as you.

34:03.075 --> 34:05.010
Fuck you.
I'm playing in the League.

34:05.144 --> 34:07.579
[LeMarcus] Hey, look,
we ain't come here
for all that, all right?

34:07.713 --> 34:10.015
Look, me and E are serious
about this.

34:11.550 --> 34:14.186
We just came here
to let y'all know.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.888
Sleep on it. Pray on it.

34:17.022 --> 34:19.425
-Look, I appreciate y'all.
-Yeah. All right, yeah.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.460
All right.

34:21.593 --> 34:24.730
No hard feelings.
Yeah, no hard feelings.

34:24.863 --> 34:26.898
Collective action.

34:27.032 --> 34:30.702
Man, I hope we get
to play those guys.
Go ahead, Ned.

34:30.836 --> 34:33.539
If we don't get Cecil
on board, we're gonna
need the whole squad,

34:33.672 --> 34:35.040
or we ain't
playing shit.

34:35.174 --> 34:37.409
We get the younger guys,
Orlando will come too.

34:38.844 --> 34:40.679
Hey, get
Bob Reynolds a note.

34:40.812 --> 34:43.048
Tell him we'll give him
the exclusive.

34:43.182 --> 34:44.583
Copy that.

34:49.721 --> 34:52.057
Wonder how many of these
we've gone through already.

34:52.191 --> 34:54.826
[siren whoops]
[crowd cheering]

34:59.398 --> 35:01.099
We don't want
nobody to know.

35:01.233 --> 35:02.768
The press or anybody.
We don't even know
that he sits.

35:02.901 --> 35:04.703
Okay? Make sure
you keep them out.

35:04.836 --> 35:06.538
[crowd continues cheering]

35:32.130 --> 35:35.133
We all present
and accounted for, Scotty?
Yes, sir.

35:36.902 --> 35:39.405
LeMarcus James,
for those of you
who are not familiar,

35:39.538 --> 35:41.173
won the Heisman Trophy
this year.

35:41.307 --> 35:43.575
Most famous player
in college football.

35:43.709 --> 35:45.744
Picture's 130 feet tall
across the street,

35:45.877 --> 35:48.314
and now you're telling me,
what, he's the fucking
Invisible Man?

35:48.447 --> 35:50.516
[Scotty] We're working
with hotel security, Coach.

35:50.649 --> 35:53.219
They went out a fire exit
without a camera.
That's how we lost 'em.

35:53.352 --> 35:56.154
Well, the media found him,
didn't they?

35:56.288 --> 35:58.457
I don't know.
Maybe I should ask
LeBron James for help

35:58.590 --> 36:00.659
instead of you
simple snowflakes,

36:00.792 --> 36:03.862
who I feed, clothe
and pay six figures a year.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.864
Or get a free
top-tier education.

36:05.997 --> 36:08.133
This is a fucking
manhunt.

36:08.267 --> 36:10.636
Find me LeMarcus James
and Emmett Sunday,

36:10.769 --> 36:12.938
or I swear to God,

36:13.071 --> 36:16.375
the next coaching job
any of you get within
shitting distance of

36:16.508 --> 36:20.312
is gonna be JV
at the fucking
Little Sisters of the Poor.

36:21.747 --> 36:24.383
Go! Get out there!
Go fucking find him, now!

36:24.516 --> 36:26.652
We'll find him, Coach.
Goddamn it.

36:30.121 --> 36:31.890
[softly] Goddamn.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.762
Come on, fellas.
Eat up.

36:37.496 --> 36:39.030
[LeMarcus scoffs]

36:39.164 --> 36:42.000
Y'all can hate me
all you want.

36:42.133 --> 36:44.470
I ain't the one
y'all should be hatin'.

36:44.603 --> 36:47.673
Ain't me cashing out
on millions of dollars
a year

36:47.806 --> 36:50.676
while y'all can't pay rent,
can't put gas in y'all whips.

36:50.809 --> 36:52.844
If you even have a whip.
[scoffs]

36:52.978 --> 36:55.046
For 55 years,

36:55.180 --> 36:58.417
guys like you ate, drank,
fucked and played ball.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.686
We're just happy with
a free education, right?

37:00.819 --> 37:03.088
Nice free suit?
That shit'll keep us
happy, right?

37:03.221 --> 37:05.391
They know how to get us.
But not no more, okay?

37:05.524 --> 37:07.726
This shit is capitalism
at its finest.

37:07.859 --> 37:09.428
Greed at its worst.

37:09.561 --> 37:12.764
Everybody around us
got private jets
and private chefs,

37:12.898 --> 37:15.501
and we can't even
accept a fucking
free meal as a gift.

37:15.634 --> 37:17.736
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
That pizza slice
right there,

37:17.869 --> 37:19.571
double fistin'
with them shits,

37:19.705 --> 37:22.073
that kid kicked out
of college twice. Shit.

37:22.207 --> 37:25.444
And we out there
every single day.
Blood, sweat and tears.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.045
You remember
your ankle, bro? Hmm?

37:27.178 --> 37:28.947
Remember when it swole up
like a watermelon?

37:29.080 --> 37:31.750
They shot you up,
and they made you play,
didn't they? Huh?

37:31.883 --> 37:34.152
Think about how that shit
gonna make you feel
in 30 years.

37:34.286 --> 37:36.322
You ain't got no medical.
You got insurance?

37:36.455 --> 37:38.824
What you gonna fix
your broken body with, huh?
Duct tape?

37:38.957 --> 37:40.959
Gorilla Glue the shits
back together?
What we gonna do?

37:41.092 --> 37:42.761
That's how y'all got to be
thinking about this.

37:42.894 --> 37:44.430
Where do we want to be
in 30 years from now?

37:44.563 --> 37:47.198
It starts right now.
It starts right here.

37:51.737 --> 37:53.104
Who bought
all this Pizza Hut?

37:57.242 --> 37:59.177
[LeMarcus] Look,
I'll be the first to say it.

37:59.311 --> 38:01.747
Lazor's taught me a lot
about more than just football.

38:01.880 --> 38:04.650
But what I began to realize
is I was being brainwashed,

38:04.783 --> 38:06.652
just like all of y'all.

38:06.785 --> 38:09.621
Scared of speaking up
because it was easy
to go along to get along.

38:09.755 --> 38:11.823
Don't let them tell you
there ain't enough
to go around.

38:11.957 --> 38:14.493
They got so much money,
they don't even know
where to put the shits.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.094
Y'all okay with that?

38:16.227 --> 38:18.229
All right.
You okay with that?

38:18.364 --> 38:21.299
[person] Guys, don't think
this isn't a two-way street.

38:21.433 --> 38:23.335
Where do you green fucks

38:23.469 --> 38:27.272
think you're transferring to
if I bury your ass
on the pine?

38:27.406 --> 38:29.941
I own your future.

38:30.075 --> 38:33.612
Where the hell
is LeMarcus?

38:33.745 --> 38:35.681
Let's be real.

38:35.814 --> 38:38.149
There are 12,500
draft-eligible players

38:38.283 --> 38:40.552
for the NFL
every single year,

38:40.686 --> 38:42.588
and only 300 of us
get drafted.

38:42.721 --> 38:44.990
That means
over 12,000 of us

38:45.123 --> 38:47.359
participate
in a multi-billion-
dollar industry

38:47.493 --> 38:48.994
that won't even give us
health insurance.

38:49.127 --> 38:51.630
And yet, they selling us
the pearly gates?

38:51.763 --> 38:53.632
Zed,
you got a resume?

38:53.765 --> 38:55.767
Internship? Why not?

38:55.901 --> 38:58.069
'Cause you been playing
D-I football for the last
three years, right?

38:58.203 --> 38:59.905
That's right.
And they make you work it

39:00.038 --> 39:02.641
like it's a full-time job,
don't they? That's right.

39:02.774 --> 39:05.544
What about all those bullshit
classes they make you take
to stay on the field, huh?

39:05.677 --> 39:07.846
Hey, you remember
the Swahili shit
y'all was taking?

39:07.979 --> 39:11.049
Swahili? How do you say,
"Do you want fries with that?"
in Swahili?

39:11.182 --> 39:14.219
Guess what, fellas.
When y'all get out there
in the real world,

39:14.352 --> 39:16.187
out there in the jungle,

39:16.321 --> 39:17.989
it ain't no fun
when you broke as a joke.

39:18.123 --> 39:20.659
Tell us where he's at.
I'm taking it back.

39:20.792 --> 39:23.695
He at the W,
stayin' under a fake name.

39:23.829 --> 39:25.531
Okay.

39:25.664 --> 39:27.332
Barack Gambino.

39:27.466 --> 39:30.101
Barack Gambino, man?
Seriously?

39:30.235 --> 39:31.537
Bank it.

39:33.405 --> 39:36.074
And even if it means
the death of me,
y'all can say,

39:36.207 --> 39:40.245
"I got caught up
with that crazy motherfucker
and his dreams of glory.

39:40.378 --> 39:42.380
And if I can do it,
then we can do it,

39:42.514 --> 39:45.383
and we could set ourselves up
and future generations
to come.

39:45.517 --> 39:47.318
Tell 'em about the barn, LJ.

39:47.453 --> 39:49.921
'Cause there
is a barn in Galilee
with grain filled so high

39:50.055 --> 39:51.557
that they won't even
sell it all.

39:51.690 --> 39:54.159
And you know what God says?
He says, "You poor fools.

39:54.292 --> 39:57.362
You may think that you're rich,
but you are poor
in the eyes of God."

39:57.496 --> 40:00.966
Why? Because
my people are hungry,
and your barn is full.

40:01.099 --> 40:03.735
-Make it plain!
-There is a barn in Galilee

40:03.869 --> 40:06.204
filled with grain,
and we out here starving.

40:06.337 --> 40:08.073
God is with us.

40:08.206 --> 40:11.577
He says
there is nothing to lose.
There is nothing to fear.

40:11.710 --> 40:15.547
I am here, and there is
nothing to fear!

40:18.684 --> 40:20.285
[panting]

40:25.056 --> 40:27.358
[upbeat country music playing]

40:34.299 --> 40:36.067
Boo.
[chuckles]

40:36.902 --> 40:38.236
Boo.

40:38.369 --> 40:40.472
[both chuckle]

40:40.606 --> 40:43.008
[upbeat country music
continues playing]

40:47.613 --> 40:49.080
Come with me.

40:49.214 --> 40:50.949
[chuckling]

40:51.082 --> 40:53.118
I plan to, baby.

40:55.353 --> 40:57.155
I mean it.

40:58.524 --> 40:59.991
Start a new chapter.

41:03.428 --> 41:05.631
You really
want me there?

41:07.398 --> 41:08.466
I do.

41:10.168 --> 41:11.503
[softly] Really?

41:44.603 --> 41:46.672
[all howl]

41:46.805 --> 41:48.574
[cheering]

41:48.707 --> 41:50.842
[announcer] Give it up
for French Montana!

41:50.976 --> 41:52.343
[hip-hop music playing]

41:52.477 --> 41:55.146
You like that?
You like that, baby?

41:55.280 --> 41:56.481
That was for y'all.

41:57.448 --> 42:00.652
[howls]

42:00.786 --> 42:02.854
Keep 'em coming.
You got it.

42:02.988 --> 42:05.190
Hey, what's your hurry?

42:06.692 --> 42:09.160
Rodger.
Brett.

42:09.294 --> 42:12.163
I've been head of
the booster club since '98.

42:12.297 --> 42:15.066
You ever seen
a national title game

42:15.200 --> 42:17.435
in your own luxury box,
Brett?

42:17.569 --> 42:18.937
No.

42:19.070 --> 42:23.041
Lobster, filet mignon,
blow.

42:23.174 --> 42:25.343
Whatever
your heart desires.

42:25.476 --> 42:26.745
It sounds awesome.

42:26.878 --> 42:30.515
You wanna come with?
I can get you a ticket.

42:30.649 --> 42:32.718
Are they even gonna play?

42:32.851 --> 42:37.055
Oh, they'll play.
Don't you worry your pretty
little head about that.

42:37.188 --> 42:40.959
Gonna find me
my quarterback,
and it'll be Easy Street.

42:43.261 --> 42:45.030
Five hundred dollars.

42:45.163 --> 42:47.098
And what does that
get me, Brett?

42:47.232 --> 42:49.234
A room number.

42:49.367 --> 42:51.136
What time
do you get off?

42:51.269 --> 42:53.271
[chuckles] Not mine.

42:56.407 --> 42:58.076
[knocking]

42:59.310 --> 43:01.579
[person]
LeMarcus. Emmett.

43:01.713 --> 43:02.848
[knocking]

43:02.981 --> 43:04.916
It's Rodger and Taylor.
Open up.

43:05.050 --> 43:06.918
[knocking continues]
[sighs]

43:07.052 --> 43:08.987
I guess we have
to get another room again.

43:09.120 --> 43:10.756
[Rodgers] Hey!

43:10.889 --> 43:13.391
Just go get it
before they wake up
the whole hotel, man.

43:13.524 --> 43:15.593
[knocking continues]

43:16.527 --> 43:17.929
Shut up and get inside.

43:18.063 --> 43:20.265
Easy, big fella.
We come in peace.

43:22.533 --> 43:23.935
How the hell
did you find us?

43:24.069 --> 43:26.204
-A happy accident.
-What do you want?

43:26.337 --> 43:27.806
[Rodgers] Just to talk,
that's it.

43:27.939 --> 43:29.741
One minute,
and then we're gone.

43:29.875 --> 43:33.044
Hey, you look like hell.
You okay?

43:33.178 --> 43:34.780
We're owed.

43:36.347 --> 43:38.249
You are owed?

43:38.383 --> 43:40.585
Yes. We're owed.

43:40.719 --> 43:44.522
Taylor.
What I think my associate
is trying to communicate here

43:44.656 --> 43:45.991
is that we're hurtin'.

43:46.124 --> 43:49.160
We feel like
we're invested here,

43:49.294 --> 43:51.863
especially after all
we've been through together.

43:51.997 --> 43:54.666
Because you loaned me a car?

43:54.800 --> 43:56.601
And helped refinance
your mother's mortgage

43:56.735 --> 43:58.970
when she fell behind,
and also with your brother.

43:59.104 --> 44:02.741
-Should we talk
about the message--
-Don't... say another word.

44:05.243 --> 44:06.812
And don't do this.

44:06.945 --> 44:08.814
You don't give a shit
about us.

44:08.947 --> 44:12.317
-All you give a shit about
is your damn game.
-Now, now, now, Taylor.

44:14.786 --> 44:17.322
LeMarcus, what--
what's going on here?

44:17.455 --> 44:19.190
Me and you are buddies.

44:19.324 --> 44:21.192
You love playing football.

44:21.326 --> 44:23.361
Hell, I love watching you
play football.

44:23.494 --> 44:26.664
An entire college campus,
40,000 kids,

44:26.798 --> 44:28.934
thinks that you're
Jesus Christ incarnate.

44:29.067 --> 44:32.170
What's going on?
You need money?

44:33.171 --> 44:35.206
Just tell me
where to send the check.

44:36.742 --> 44:38.509
What the fuck
don't you get?

44:42.447 --> 44:43.882
You ever read The Jungle?

44:44.015 --> 44:46.084
What has that got to do
with anything, LeMarcus?

44:46.217 --> 44:47.819
The American Dream.

44:49.387 --> 44:51.723
This guy Jurgis
from Lithuania,

44:51.857 --> 44:54.092
he worked
at the meat-packing plant
in Chicago.

44:54.225 --> 44:56.127
Now, Jurgis was young,

44:56.261 --> 44:58.163
he was bigger, stronger
than the rest of 'em.

44:58.296 --> 45:00.198
So they put him
to work in the kill beds.

45:00.331 --> 45:02.834
He worked so hard,
he couldn't bend
his fingers.

45:02.968 --> 45:06.071
He couldn't flex his knees,
broke his ankle.

45:06.204 --> 45:08.673
After all those years,
he just kept on working,

45:08.807 --> 45:11.009
and he loved it.

45:11.142 --> 45:14.880
See, that didn't mean shit
to the guys who owned
the plant though, did it?

45:15.013 --> 45:18.483
'Cause they weren't
about to take care
of no broke immigrant.

45:19.550 --> 45:23.054
LeMarcus... [sighs]
You ain't that guy.

45:23.188 --> 45:25.924
You're about to be
the number one pick

45:26.057 --> 45:28.259
in the first round
of the NFL draft,

45:28.393 --> 45:31.830
-and Miami is gonna
pay you $35 million...
-Yeah, I know.

45:31.963 --> 45:33.698
That's a whole lot of meat.

45:33.832 --> 45:36.868
What about the guys
who ain't going
into the League?

45:37.002 --> 45:39.737
The guys who busted
their head in the dirt
for the last four years,

45:39.871 --> 45:42.273
only to wind up
mangled and broke?
What about them, huh?

45:42.407 --> 45:45.610
-So this whole thing's
about you?
-It's about everyone, man.

45:45.743 --> 45:47.946
What the fuck do you think
you're gonna do?

45:48.079 --> 45:50.548
You can't square off
with the entire system.

45:50.681 --> 45:53.418
You two cannot
unionize college sports,
and that's a fact.

45:54.853 --> 45:56.788
-It ain't two.
-What?

45:56.922 --> 45:59.224
It ain't just two of us
no more,

45:59.357 --> 46:00.758
and that's a fact.

46:04.195 --> 46:05.563
[sighs]

46:11.236 --> 46:13.571
[person] We have to
dismantle the structure

46:13.704 --> 46:15.273
and do something
that's more equitable,

46:15.406 --> 46:16.975
that's fairer
for these athletes.

46:17.108 --> 46:18.810
I've got teammates
that I played

46:18.944 --> 46:20.912
collegiate ball with
at Ohio State

46:21.046 --> 46:22.747
that suffered some
career-ending injuries,

46:22.881 --> 46:24.983
some life-altering
injuries,

46:25.116 --> 46:27.318
that struggle
and still struggle today

46:27.452 --> 46:30.088
without any support
from the university.

46:30.221 --> 46:31.789
It's very frustrating.

46:31.923 --> 46:33.658
So I'm proud
to stand behind

46:33.791 --> 46:35.793
LeMarcus James
and what he's doing.

46:35.927 --> 46:38.563
Wilson, what do you think
of the situation
with LeMarcus James?

46:38.696 --> 46:40.999
Listen, Greeny,
I'm really impressed
by LeMarcus James.

46:41.132 --> 46:43.301
This guy's given up
possibly $35 million,

46:43.434 --> 46:45.170
maybe the first pick
overall.

46:45.303 --> 46:47.438
The reality is,
he's got so much to lose

46:47.572 --> 46:49.274
but really so much to gain.

46:49.407 --> 46:51.709
And I think that you and I
both know, Greeny,

46:51.843 --> 46:54.112
that this whole system's broke,
and we got to fix it.

46:54.245 --> 46:56.281
It's got to get fixed
immediately.

46:56.414 --> 46:58.984
[Greenberg] There you have it.
Directly from one of
the great quarterbacks

46:59.117 --> 47:01.419
in the history of the NFL,
Russell Wilson.

47:01.552 --> 47:04.355
He won the Walter Payton
Man of the Year award
in 2020.

47:04.489 --> 47:06.757
Russell, thank you.
Always a pleasure, Greeny.
I'll see you soon.

47:06.892 --> 47:10.128
[Greenberg] In the meantime,
we've got other news
to talk about...

47:11.562 --> 47:13.198
I understand.

47:15.967 --> 47:18.036
Yeah, we all know
what's at stake here.

47:19.537 --> 47:21.873
I will get
him into this game.

47:22.007 --> 47:24.375
You have
my personal guarantee.

47:24.509 --> 47:25.843
Of course.

47:25.977 --> 47:27.845
Well, thank you--
Yeah, he hung up on me.

47:27.979 --> 47:30.882
[sighs, panting]

47:31.016 --> 47:33.351
You're up early.
What, do you sleep
in that power suit?

47:33.484 --> 47:35.353
I might as well
at this point, right?

47:36.454 --> 47:38.489
Pressure
from the overlords?

47:38.623 --> 47:41.292
I'd say my very early
retirement is being discussed

47:41.426 --> 47:43.661
unless I change the optics,
and quick.

47:43.794 --> 47:46.231
And if I go,
so goes your retainer.

47:46.364 --> 47:49.034
[laughs] We can't let
that happen, now, can we?

47:51.002 --> 47:52.503
We offer talks.

47:53.571 --> 47:55.006
We hear their demands.

47:55.140 --> 47:57.742
We promise a committee
to explore.
No.

48:01.746 --> 48:04.049
They've got 40 players now.

48:04.182 --> 48:07.185
[Mike] I heard.
They think
they can win this.

48:07.318 --> 48:10.221
If we offer talks,
then they will never leave
the table empty-handed.

48:10.355 --> 48:12.523
They're kids.
Exactly.

48:12.657 --> 48:15.593
They haven't lost enough
to believe that that's
the most likely outcome.

48:15.726 --> 48:19.564
They don't understand
that life is about losing.

48:20.831 --> 48:22.400
I pay you for options.
What are they?

48:22.533 --> 48:24.369
Well, I can only see two.

48:24.502 --> 48:26.437
You either give them
what they want...

48:26.571 --> 48:28.373
Second option?

48:28.506 --> 48:30.875
We savage them.

48:33.678 --> 48:37.048
You find everything--
every grain, every person.

48:37.182 --> 48:41.586
You turn LeMarcus James
into a monster
that no one could follow.

48:43.221 --> 48:45.423
LeMarcus decided
to do this.

48:45.556 --> 48:47.959
He waded into your waters.

48:48.093 --> 48:50.328
We have to react.

48:52.697 --> 48:56.001
Unfortunately,
I don't have the luxury
to react, Ms. Poe.

48:59.037 --> 49:00.505
But you do.

49:08.513 --> 49:10.448
[LeMarcus coughing]

49:11.916 --> 49:13.418
It's started.

49:14.619 --> 49:16.054
What?

49:16.187 --> 49:18.056
They got their hounds loose.

49:20.458 --> 49:21.859
[LeMarcus sighs]

49:21.993 --> 49:24.329
And you know
they're gonna dig up more.

49:24.462 --> 49:26.097
[crowd cheering]

49:26.231 --> 49:28.799
[chanting]
LJ! LJ! LJ! LJ! LJ!

49:28.933 --> 49:30.635
[whooping, cheering]

49:33.671 --> 49:35.806
[Emmett] We're gonna
have to move again.

49:37.708 --> 49:38.843
No more running.

49:40.911 --> 49:42.280
Let 'em come.

49:44.149 --> 49:46.584
Luke?
Yes, every player.

49:46.717 --> 49:48.286
I don't care. Luke!

49:48.419 --> 49:51.456
On the goddamn roof,
for all I care.
Thirty minutes.

49:51.589 --> 49:54.225
Bailey,
have you seen Luke?

49:54.359 --> 49:56.327
I got nine players

49:56.461 --> 49:59.497
and the cabal
of fucking idiocy around me.

49:59.630 --> 50:02.233
I sent him to the store
for McConnell's ice cream.

50:02.367 --> 50:04.502
Baby, you can't
be doing that now.

50:04.635 --> 50:07.072
This is fucking serious!
LeMarcus...

50:07.205 --> 50:08.973
Goddamn it!
You know what hurts the most?

50:09.107 --> 50:11.609
He never came to me
with any of this,

50:11.742 --> 50:13.944
after everything
we've been through together.

50:21.286 --> 50:22.687
Are you...

50:22.820 --> 50:26.191
Jesus fucking Christ.
Are you fucking kidding me?

50:27.024 --> 50:28.326
Now?

50:28.459 --> 50:30.595
I got a full-on rebellion
in my locker room,

50:30.728 --> 50:33.831
I got the head of the NCAA
and both conferences
up my ass

50:33.964 --> 50:36.934
at the national fucking
title game...

50:37.068 --> 50:40.138
Now? You're gonna...
Coach, we talked
about this.

50:40.271 --> 50:44.175
How can I say this again
in a way that you can get it?

50:44.309 --> 50:46.511
I need to find myself again.

50:46.644 --> 50:49.180
I need some me time.
Not you time. Me time.

50:49.314 --> 50:51.549
Goddamn, you
fuckin' selfish...

50:51.682 --> 50:54.852
Wow! Finish it.
Finish it.

50:54.985 --> 50:57.188
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

50:57.322 --> 50:58.623
I'm sorry.
[scoffs]

50:58.756 --> 51:00.258
I know the sacrifices
you've made for me.

51:00.391 --> 51:03.394
Of course I do.
But please...

51:13.204 --> 51:15.540
Okay, which place do you
want me to stay away from?

51:15.673 --> 51:17.675
Where are you going?
The beach house?

51:19.043 --> 51:20.411
I'm going to Rome.

51:20.545 --> 51:21.912
Rome?

51:23.648 --> 51:25.683
Okay, I can stay away
from Rome.

51:34.292 --> 51:36.461
You're not going
to Rome alone, are you?

51:38.363 --> 51:40.398
If I hadn't stayed here

51:40.531 --> 51:42.367
to explain to you
that I was leaving,

51:42.500 --> 51:44.202
would you have noticed
I'd gone?

51:44.335 --> 51:46.137
I know. I get it. I get it.
All I wanna know--

51:46.271 --> 51:49.240
Look.
It's this fucking job.

51:49.374 --> 51:50.775
Oh, God.

51:50.908 --> 51:54.078
I swear to God,
I will make it up to you.

51:54.212 --> 51:56.281
Okay? Please.

51:56.414 --> 51:58.916
I swear to God,
I'm gonna make this up to you.

51:59.049 --> 52:00.185
It's just...
James...

52:00.318 --> 52:02.687
We just got
to get past this game.

52:02.820 --> 52:03.821
Please.

52:03.954 --> 52:05.290
James...

52:05.423 --> 52:08.193
Baby, I need you here
with me now, please.

52:23.808 --> 52:25.443
[mutters]

52:34.519 --> 52:38.022
Oh, um...
You want Coach.
He's in the back.

52:38.155 --> 52:39.857
Can you... please?

52:39.990 --> 52:42.059
Yeah, sure, sure. Sure.
Thank you.
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

52:43.027 --> 52:44.829
Good to meet you.

52:48.899 --> 52:50.335
Coach?

52:54.239 --> 52:55.673
Coach Lazor?

53:03.147 --> 53:05.149
Morning, Coach.
Uh, Katherine Poe.

53:05.283 --> 53:06.484
We met earlier?

53:06.617 --> 53:08.519
Is now okay, sir?

53:08.653 --> 53:10.421
It's kind of urgent.

53:10.555 --> 53:11.889
[sighs]

53:16.927 --> 53:18.696
[clears throat]

53:20.531 --> 53:22.066
Everything all right?

53:23.033 --> 53:25.736
Well, if there's
anything I can do...

53:25.870 --> 53:28.806
Just...
What do you want?

53:28.939 --> 53:31.276
You have a rebellion
on your hands, sir.

53:31.409 --> 53:33.711
[stammering]
What exactly do you do?

53:33.844 --> 53:36.381
-You're with the NCAA?
-I'm not. I'm outside counsel.

53:36.514 --> 53:38.283
And your name again?
Katherine.

53:38.416 --> 53:41.185
Katherine, would you mind
just fucking off
back to your C-suite?

53:47.692 --> 53:51.762
This is a private physical
LeMarcus had.

53:52.963 --> 53:57.234
It's from July
for an insurance policy.

53:59.404 --> 54:01.005
How did you get that?

54:01.138 --> 54:05.209
It's a firm specializing
in medical data acquisition.

54:06.577 --> 54:11.582
And this is an MRI
of LeMarcus' left knee,

54:11.716 --> 54:14.785
which, unfortunately,
has no cartilage.

54:17.522 --> 54:19.624
He's been hiding it
for five months.

54:22.493 --> 54:24.862
His body
is a ticking time bomb.

54:24.995 --> 54:27.898
It's only a matter of time
before that knee
gives out on him.

54:28.032 --> 54:30.701
He is never going to be
the number one pick,

54:30.835 --> 54:33.270
not after the combine
and a physical.

54:33.404 --> 54:35.172
He'll be lucky
if he got to go day two,

54:35.306 --> 54:36.974
and he's known that
for some time.

54:37.107 --> 54:39.810
I have seen nothing to indicate
he's got a bad knee.

54:39.944 --> 54:43.581
He's 21.
He could eat gunpowder
and then go run a marathon.

54:43.714 --> 54:45.483
Now, look.

54:46.717 --> 54:49.420
It's best
if this comes from you.

54:50.855 --> 54:53.958
How disappointed
you were to learn
that he's been hiding this.

54:54.091 --> 54:58.329
Maybe, in retrospect,
you did notice the limp
during practice.

54:58.463 --> 55:00.598
What exactly are you saying?

55:00.731 --> 55:03.801
Five months ago, LeMarcus
figured out he is not going
to be the number one pick,

55:03.934 --> 55:06.804
and he is trying to cash in
now before the teller...

55:06.937 --> 55:09.039
That is bullshit.
Yes, sir. Before
the teller window closes.

55:09.173 --> 55:11.676
LeMarcus would never--
This is a shakedown, sir!

55:11.809 --> 55:13.944
Pure and simple.

55:14.078 --> 55:16.146
He is trying
to recoup his losses,

55:16.280 --> 55:18.115
and he is going
to take everything

55:18.248 --> 55:21.285
that you and your players
have worked for.

55:23.320 --> 55:25.956
Let me ask you, sir,
how does a D-III quarterback

55:26.090 --> 55:29.293
with a noodle
for an arm who runs
a five-flat 40 time,

55:29.427 --> 55:31.762
how does a guy like that
become the head coach

55:31.896 --> 55:33.831
of not one but two
D-I powerhouses?

55:33.964 --> 55:36.467
Because that guy
is a winner.

55:37.435 --> 55:38.903
And this is your time

55:39.036 --> 55:41.071
to finally capture
that national title.

55:41.205 --> 55:45.242
Do not let LeMarcus
rob you of your legacy.

55:47.177 --> 55:51.148
Now, we will leak this
to the smaller sites.

55:51.281 --> 55:53.851
You will do a presser
for the networks,

55:53.984 --> 55:56.654
and the aggregators
will take it from there.

55:59.924 --> 56:01.492
I, um...

56:01.626 --> 56:03.661
I have some remarks.

56:03.794 --> 56:05.496
If you want
to take a look at...
No, thank you.

56:05.630 --> 56:08.833
I don't need
your fucking remarks.

56:10.401 --> 56:12.336
This is my football team.

56:13.638 --> 56:16.441
They will play for me.
Coach...

56:17.675 --> 56:18.776
wake up,

56:19.844 --> 56:22.246
before you don't
even have a team.

56:42.933 --> 56:44.635
[inhales deeply]

56:50.941 --> 56:52.543
[exhales sharply]

56:55.713 --> 56:57.582
I know right now...

56:59.850 --> 57:02.520
you think life is always
gonna be like this.

57:05.255 --> 57:07.357
You're at the center
of everything.

57:09.894 --> 57:11.228
Alive.

57:14.131 --> 57:15.566
And greatness

57:16.734 --> 57:18.503
is right there,

57:18.636 --> 57:20.170
within reach.

57:25.510 --> 57:27.077
But that's not true.

57:29.013 --> 57:33.584
This may very well be
your only fleeting moment

57:33.718 --> 57:36.253
at the top
of the mountain.

57:37.955 --> 57:40.190
Look at me.
I'm 60 years old.

57:41.592 --> 57:43.160
I look like I'm 80.

57:44.328 --> 57:46.430
I feel like I'm a hundred.

57:50.167 --> 57:52.102
I got a wife that hates me.

57:55.606 --> 57:57.675
Well, she just left,
actually.

58:00.578 --> 58:03.581
I got a cock
that doesn't work
without a fucking pill.

58:08.085 --> 58:09.419
My best buddy,

58:11.188 --> 58:14.625
since we were
little knuckleheads
playing Pee Wee football...

58:16.126 --> 58:19.029
My best friend, Clint,
just died of blood cancer.

58:21.098 --> 58:22.633
Just like that.

58:24.301 --> 58:27.304
Forty years ago, I was you.

58:28.505 --> 58:30.107
I was you, men.

58:31.108 --> 58:33.010
Magnificent.

58:33.143 --> 58:36.581
Quarterback
of my little college
in North Dakota.

58:37.815 --> 58:41.652
I had dreams, and I had
the energy to chase 'em.

58:43.353 --> 58:45.656
-And now...
-[snaps fingers]

58:49.159 --> 58:51.195
...I got one thing left,

58:51.328 --> 58:54.264
one thing in my life

58:55.900 --> 58:57.902
that means a damn
to me:

59:09.880 --> 59:11.215
You men.

59:13.584 --> 59:14.785
This room.

59:19.690 --> 59:21.358
This is all I got...

59:25.529 --> 59:27.064
and that's okay.

59:28.733 --> 59:31.568
Believe me,
this is all I need.

59:34.371 --> 59:37.174
Now, some of you are
looking at me like, "Well...

59:37.307 --> 59:39.276
bullshit, Coach.

59:39.409 --> 59:40.544
Come on, now.

59:41.378 --> 59:42.379
You got money.

59:42.512 --> 59:45.049
You're fucking rich."

59:45.182 --> 59:48.819
Yeah, I got money I...
I couldn't even conceive of

59:48.953 --> 59:51.255
when I was you men.

59:52.723 --> 59:54.892
Believe me
when I tell you this--

59:55.693 --> 59:57.227
Money...

59:58.796 --> 1:00:00.197
is shit.

1:00:01.766 --> 1:00:04.034
Money is a numbers game

1:00:04.168 --> 1:00:06.804
played by people
in $5,000 suits

1:00:06.937 --> 1:00:09.774
in New York City offices
for their own benefit.

1:00:09.907 --> 1:00:11.976
There is no glory

1:00:13.277 --> 1:00:14.411
in money,

1:00:14.544 --> 1:00:18.615
no life-altering challenge
in money.

1:00:18.749 --> 1:00:21.752
There is no confrontation
with your deepest fears

1:00:21.886 --> 1:00:26.256
and therefore your greatness,
in fucking money.

1:00:27.958 --> 1:00:29.259
Oh, my God.

1:00:29.393 --> 1:00:31.762
What I wouldn't give
to be you men

1:00:33.063 --> 1:00:34.431
right now.

1:00:36.100 --> 1:00:38.335
One day away
from glorious battle

1:00:38.468 --> 1:00:40.604
alongside
your band of brothers

1:00:40.738 --> 1:00:44.574
in front of
a hundred million people
all over the world.

1:00:44.709 --> 1:00:46.276
Glory.

1:00:48.278 --> 1:00:51.882
The greatest glory
you are ever gonna feel.

1:00:53.483 --> 1:00:56.486
Do you want
to give that up?

1:00:56.620 --> 1:01:00.024
For those of you who were
thinking about boycotting,

1:01:01.291 --> 1:01:03.127
you've made your point.

1:01:03.260 --> 1:01:05.095
They are gonna have to change.

1:01:06.130 --> 1:01:07.698
'Cause they heard you.

1:01:07.832 --> 1:01:10.467
They are scared
shitless.

1:01:10.600 --> 1:01:13.503
It's beautiful.
It's fucking hilarious.

1:01:13.637 --> 1:01:16.440
Change is coming.
Meaningful change.

1:01:16.573 --> 1:01:18.542
Trust me on that.

1:01:19.877 --> 1:01:22.146
Every one of you has worked

1:01:22.279 --> 1:01:26.183
your whole fucking life
for this moment.

1:01:27.351 --> 1:01:31.188
Don't rob yourselves
of your destiny.

1:01:32.122 --> 1:01:33.991
Glory is at hand.

1:01:36.160 --> 1:01:37.627
Glory

1:01:38.695 --> 1:01:40.564
is yours.

1:01:40.697 --> 1:01:43.834
Glory is ours!

1:01:46.103 --> 1:01:47.537
Glory!

1:01:49.807 --> 1:01:51.041
Take it.

1:02:15.532 --> 1:02:18.936
I heard
it was a great speech.

1:02:19.069 --> 1:02:23.107
Now, let's prove to them that
LeMarcus is only doing this
for his own benefit,

1:02:23.240 --> 1:02:24.875
so you have enough players

1:02:25.009 --> 1:02:28.078
not only to play this thing,
but to win.

1:02:31.015 --> 1:02:32.649
Do you need a minute,
Coach?

1:02:32.783 --> 1:02:35.552
You need to
collect yourself? Okay.

1:02:36.753 --> 1:02:38.522
Let's get it over with.

1:02:40.024 --> 1:02:41.358
Right.

1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:46.196
[indistinct TV chatter]

1:02:46.330 --> 1:02:48.265
One miner's breakfast.

1:02:49.099 --> 1:02:50.901
Breakfast of champions.

1:02:51.035 --> 1:02:52.636
[coughs]

1:02:54.805 --> 1:02:56.941
[newscaster]
Now, I understand we have
some late-breaking news.

1:02:57.074 --> 1:02:59.409
Yes, we're going
to a live press conference

1:02:59.543 --> 1:03:01.411
with Wolves head coach
James Lazor.

1:03:01.545 --> 1:03:04.481
[reporter 1] Coach Lazor,
when did you first notice,

1:03:04.614 --> 1:03:06.416
LeMarcus James' knee?

1:03:07.384 --> 1:03:09.053
[sighs]

1:03:10.420 --> 1:03:12.322
Well, I had noticed
a slight limp,

1:03:12.456 --> 1:03:14.825
uh, after week three,

1:03:14.959 --> 1:03:18.128
but I just chalked it up
to, you know, the usual
bumps and bruises.

1:03:19.729 --> 1:03:21.431
So, I was, um...

1:03:22.933 --> 1:03:24.935
I was disappointed
when I found out

1:03:25.069 --> 1:03:27.838
that he'd been concealing
something more serious.

1:03:27.972 --> 1:03:30.607
I can't believe Coach
is doing this.
[reporter 2] Do you think

1:03:30.740 --> 1:03:32.877
he concealed his injury
to protect his draft status?

1:03:33.010 --> 1:03:35.712
I don't know.
He's gonna have to pass
a very thorough physical

1:03:35.846 --> 1:03:37.281
before the draft, so...

1:03:38.548 --> 1:03:41.351
They found that MRI quick.
Their man's good.

1:03:41.485 --> 1:03:43.921
[reporter 3] Do you feel he was
manipulating his teammates

1:03:44.054 --> 1:03:45.956
to cash in
on the national title game?

1:03:46.090 --> 1:03:48.292
I guess you'd have
to ask his teammates that.

1:03:48.425 --> 1:03:51.495
Coach, do you feel
that this is a further example

1:03:51.628 --> 1:03:53.864
of a form of modern-day
slave trade?

1:04:00.104 --> 1:04:02.539
I-I'm sorry. I guess I don't
understand that question.

1:04:02.672 --> 1:04:06.010
The physical. Like inspecting
a slave's teeth
to determine the price.

1:04:06.143 --> 1:04:07.811
Only now, it's his knees.

1:04:11.115 --> 1:04:16.020
Well, if you call getting
a free top-tier education

1:04:16.153 --> 1:04:20.490
and four years of
first-class accommodations
and nutrition,

1:04:20.624 --> 1:04:23.460
not to mention
a sizable living stipend,

1:04:23.593 --> 1:04:26.663
and then toss in a once-
in-a-lifetime opportunity

1:04:26.796 --> 1:04:28.598
to play
in a national title game,

1:04:28.732 --> 1:04:31.035
if we're calling that
the slave trade,

1:04:31.168 --> 1:04:33.237
then I'd love
to be a slave.

1:04:33.370 --> 1:04:35.072
[reporters murmuring]

1:04:35.205 --> 1:04:36.506
Um...

1:04:36.640 --> 1:04:38.208
That's...
That's the last question.

1:04:40.144 --> 1:04:41.912
Well, that
already went viral.

1:04:42.046 --> 1:04:43.347
[scoffs]

1:04:43.480 --> 1:04:45.349
[reporters clamoring]

1:04:48.318 --> 1:04:49.386
Call Greeny.

1:04:50.820 --> 1:04:52.822
Tell him
we're going live.

1:04:52.957 --> 1:04:54.758
Splash it
all over Twitter too.

1:04:55.993 --> 1:04:58.228
I am joined now
by LeMarcus James,

1:04:58.362 --> 1:05:00.264
who won this year's
Heisman Trophy

1:05:00.397 --> 1:05:04.068
and has now rocked
the entire world of sports
and well beyond

1:05:04.201 --> 1:05:06.603
with his boycott
of the national title game,

1:05:06.736 --> 1:05:08.939
which is scheduled
for tomorrow
in New Orleans.

1:05:09.073 --> 1:05:11.675
LeMarcus, I'm gonna jump
right into the question
everyone is asking.

1:05:11.808 --> 1:05:15.379
Are you boycotting this game
and demanding compensation

1:05:15.512 --> 1:05:17.781
because of an unfortunate
medical condition

1:05:17.914 --> 1:05:20.584
that could jeopardize
your status in the draft?

1:05:20.717 --> 1:05:22.086
Good morning, Greeny.

1:05:22.219 --> 1:05:24.721
The answer is no.
Unequivocally, no.

1:05:25.722 --> 1:05:27.624
I have no cartilage
in my left knee.

1:05:27.757 --> 1:05:30.760
It'll degenerate over time.
Maybe eight years, maybe 20.

1:05:30.894 --> 1:05:32.729
But name me an NFL team
that wouldn't take

1:05:32.862 --> 1:05:34.764
eight to 20 years
of elite quarterback play.

1:05:34.898 --> 1:05:37.501
You see, the reality is,
this isn't about me.

1:05:37.634 --> 1:05:39.303
This is about
our current system.

1:05:39.436 --> 1:05:41.938
It's about my fellow
D-I athletes and teammates

1:05:42.072 --> 1:05:43.473
who have fallen victim to,

1:05:43.607 --> 1:05:45.742
quite frankly,
a plantation mentality.

1:05:45.875 --> 1:05:47.811
[Greenberg] I wanna talk
about that mentality.

1:05:47.944 --> 1:05:49.879
That's fucking rich.

1:05:50.014 --> 1:05:52.249
'Cause clearly,
that is at the center
of this entire conversation.

1:05:52.382 --> 1:05:53.984
Your coach, just today,

1:05:54.118 --> 1:05:56.720
said this is a system
he'd love to be a part of

1:05:56.853 --> 1:05:59.789
and even invoked
the tragic word "slavery."

1:05:59.923 --> 1:06:02.159
I have to ask you,
do you feel

1:06:02.292 --> 1:06:05.662
this is a slave trade
of a different kind?

1:06:05.795 --> 1:06:10.134
-[LeMarcus] Can I give you
another comparison, Greeny?
-Yeah, of course.

1:06:10.267 --> 1:06:13.637
This is the home
of my best friend
and teammate, Emmett Sunday.

1:06:13.770 --> 1:06:16.273
Emmett's father is a farmer
outside Lincoln, Nebraska,

1:06:16.406 --> 1:06:18.242
and his mother
is a teacher's assistant.

1:06:18.375 --> 1:06:20.144
They've saved up
a little bit for retirement,

1:06:20.277 --> 1:06:22.279
but mostly, they just live
month to month.

1:06:22.412 --> 1:06:25.815
One swollen appendix,
one turned ankle
from insolvency.

1:06:25.949 --> 1:06:28.352
Now, their son, Emmett Sunday,
has been a four-year starter

1:06:28.485 --> 1:06:30.654
for one of the best college
programs in the country.

1:06:30.787 --> 1:06:32.389
Tomorrow,
he'll play in a game

1:06:32.522 --> 1:06:34.658
that'll gross over
a half a billion dollars.

1:06:34.791 --> 1:06:36.693
Half a billion dollars
for a single game.

1:06:36.826 --> 1:06:38.228
And Emmett
won't see a dime.

1:06:38.362 --> 1:06:39.829
His football days
will be over.

1:06:39.963 --> 1:06:42.399
Zero compensation,
zero medical insurance

1:06:42.532 --> 1:06:45.102
for the injuries
he's sustained,
some of them permanent.

1:06:45.235 --> 1:06:46.803
And now, this...

1:06:48.172 --> 1:06:49.973
is the Palm Beach
vacation home

1:06:50.107 --> 1:06:52.209
for my coach,
James Lazor.

1:06:53.610 --> 1:06:55.612
This is
his Chicago penthouse.

1:06:57.814 --> 1:07:00.016
This is his
six-bedroom Craftsman,

1:07:00.150 --> 1:07:01.685
where he stays
during the season.

1:07:01.818 --> 1:07:03.220
His work home.

1:07:03.353 --> 1:07:05.522
Now, Coach has profited
off a system

1:07:05.655 --> 1:07:07.857
that is entirely based
on free labor.

1:07:07.991 --> 1:07:10.427
We're not playing in any games
until those who actually play--

1:07:10.560 --> 1:07:13.430
And not just the superstars.
All athletes, down to
the special teams...

1:07:13.563 --> 1:07:16.566
-Jesus.
-...are considered
and compensated.

1:07:16.700 --> 1:07:18.502
[Orlando sighs]
Now.

1:07:18.635 --> 1:07:20.637
This crazy motherfucker.
[chuckles]

1:07:20.770 --> 1:07:23.207
There you have it,
directly from
LeMarcus James.

1:07:23.340 --> 1:07:25.709
LeMarcus,
thank you very much.
All right, LeMarcus.

1:07:25.842 --> 1:07:28.378
[Greenberg]
I appreciate the time.
We'll take a short break,

1:07:28.512 --> 1:07:30.647
and be back with more
in just a moment.

1:07:30.780 --> 1:07:33.083
What the calamitous fuck?

1:07:33.217 --> 1:07:35.619
We've been goddamn
outflanked by two kids,

1:07:35.752 --> 1:07:37.421
like we're
in Scooby fucking Doo.

1:07:37.554 --> 1:07:39.589
Oh, you know what
the dipshit sidekick did

1:07:39.723 --> 1:07:42.058
when LeMarcus
was grandstanding on TV?

1:07:42.192 --> 1:07:43.460
[Katherine] Sunday.
Huh?

1:07:43.593 --> 1:07:45.295
His name is
Emmett Sunday.

1:07:45.429 --> 1:07:47.063
Oh, thank God
we got that all cleared up.

1:07:47.197 --> 1:07:51.501
Emmett fucking-us-sideways
Sunday leaks
my Nike contract.

1:07:51.635 --> 1:07:53.703
Now every New York City
zig-zag's

1:07:53.837 --> 1:07:56.072
asking me where
$30 million a year goes.

1:07:56.206 --> 1:07:57.541
[Katherine]
Where does it go?

1:07:57.674 --> 1:07:59.243
How the hell do I know?

1:07:59.376 --> 1:08:01.345
You're the head
of the conference.

1:08:01.478 --> 1:08:02.679
Excuse me?

1:08:02.812 --> 1:08:04.714
You're the head
of your conference.

1:08:04.848 --> 1:08:07.751
You should be able to answer
a layup like where
your sneaker money goes.

1:08:08.918 --> 1:08:10.654
Okay.

1:08:10.787 --> 1:08:11.955
Band fields.

1:08:12.088 --> 1:08:13.657
Softball stadiums.
[cell phone chimes]

1:08:13.790 --> 1:08:16.926
Turquoise-green
Bermuda fucking sod.
Where else?

1:08:17.060 --> 1:08:19.196
Orlando Bishop
just tweeted this.

1:08:19.329 --> 1:08:20.797
He's out.
[Everly] That's cute.

1:08:20.930 --> 1:08:22.899
We got four players
threatening to walk now too.

1:08:23.032 --> 1:08:24.434
How are these two
even doing this?

1:08:24.568 --> 1:08:26.069
I still think
Coach Lazor's the one

1:08:26.203 --> 1:08:27.804
to talk LeMarcus
off this ledge.

1:08:27.937 --> 1:08:29.973
He walks him back,
they'll all follow.

1:08:30.106 --> 1:08:31.875
Where's your coach now?

1:08:32.008 --> 1:08:34.344
He's, uh,
taking a minute.

1:08:34.478 --> 1:08:35.812
[Katherine]
He's tanking.

1:08:35.945 --> 1:08:37.747
He's fine.
[Mike] What does he need?

1:08:37.881 --> 1:08:39.749
A divorce lawyer.
[Everly chuckles]

1:08:39.883 --> 1:08:42.252
[Everly] He's fine, I said.
Lazor or no Lazor,

1:08:42.386 --> 1:08:43.920
we're putting two teams
on the field tomorrow,

1:08:44.053 --> 1:08:46.022
even if we gotta dress
the damn cheerleaders.

1:08:46.156 --> 1:08:48.292
Who's second in line
if Lazor can't go?

1:08:48.425 --> 1:08:52.362
I guess, uh, Ronnie Dunn,
defensive coordinator.

1:08:52.496 --> 1:08:54.431
You trust him?
Yeah. Company man.

1:08:54.564 --> 1:08:56.433
Been at the university
since a player himself,

1:08:56.566 --> 1:08:58.335
so, yeah, he'll take
marching orders.

1:08:58.468 --> 1:09:00.770
-You sure?
-This a fucking inquisition?

1:09:00.904 --> 1:09:04.374
I don't trust anyone
with a vested pension
and Medicare.

1:09:05.575 --> 1:09:07.277
Oh, God. You know what?

1:09:07.411 --> 1:09:09.479
Fuck you very much.

1:09:09.613 --> 1:09:12.916
All right? I need this shit
like I need a third tit.

1:09:13.049 --> 1:09:15.352
I will march
my entire conference

1:09:15.485 --> 1:09:16.986
right out that door,

1:09:17.120 --> 1:09:21.525
put together
my own play-offs
without any of you.

1:09:21.658 --> 1:09:23.126
How do you like me?

1:09:23.260 --> 1:09:25.329
You'd be in breach
of 16 different contracts,

1:09:25.462 --> 1:09:29.132
squander a $100-million payday
for tomorrow alone.

1:09:29.266 --> 1:09:32.502
Not to mention what I imagine
would be a full audit

1:09:32.636 --> 1:09:35.772
of SEC expenses
under your tenure.

1:09:35.905 --> 1:09:38.808
You know, to make sure
that those band fields,
softball stadiums

1:09:38.942 --> 1:09:42.679
and turquoise-green
Bermuda sod
weren't really just

1:09:42.812 --> 1:09:46.182
high-paid escorts
in New York City

1:09:46.316 --> 1:09:49.419
at the Bemelman Bar
of the Carlyle.

1:09:53.557 --> 1:09:56.493
Bouncing 'em
out of your apartment
three at a time, right?

1:10:04.634 --> 1:10:06.202
Fuck you.

1:10:06.803 --> 1:10:07.871
[scoffs]

1:10:09.273 --> 1:10:10.507
Hoo!

1:10:15.645 --> 1:10:17.847
[person] We're still
24 hours away

1:10:17.981 --> 1:10:20.183
from the Snickers
National Title game.

1:10:20.317 --> 1:10:22.252
-Only the biggest game...
-[person 2] Man, these guys

1:10:22.386 --> 1:10:23.920
are already getting
free education.

1:10:24.053 --> 1:10:26.222
Money is just
gonna ruin it.

1:10:26.356 --> 1:10:28.157
They aren't ready
for all that money.
I wasn't when I was 18.

1:10:28.292 --> 1:10:30.494
[person 3] I don't know
if this man is a racist,

1:10:30.627 --> 1:10:32.762
but what I do know
is that he made a fortune

1:10:32.896 --> 1:10:36.165
mostly off the backs
of young Black men.

1:10:37.301 --> 1:10:38.902
[Bailey] Question.

1:10:39.035 --> 1:10:41.405
If I hadn't stayed here
to explain to you

1:10:41.538 --> 1:10:44.974
that I was leaving,
would you have noticed
I'd gone?

1:10:46.776 --> 1:10:48.945
[panting]

1:11:07.130 --> 1:11:08.565
[indistinct chattering]

1:11:08.698 --> 1:11:10.634
[person]
Coach! Coach Lazor!

1:11:10.767 --> 1:11:13.303
-[person 2] Oh, my God.
Look, it's Coach Lazor.
-[people clamoring]

1:11:13.437 --> 1:11:15.305
[person 3] Hey, Coach,
can we get a picture?
Sorry, buddy.

1:11:15.439 --> 1:11:18.241
It's just really
not a good time, okay?
Sorry, sorry...

1:11:18.375 --> 1:11:21.077
-[clamoring continues]
-Okay, not now!

1:11:21.210 --> 1:11:24.481
Hey, give him some space.
Give him some space.

1:11:24.614 --> 1:11:26.082
No pictures! No pictures!

1:11:26.215 --> 1:11:27.551
Have a good game, Coach!

1:11:44.968 --> 1:11:47.537
[Everly] Now, I know for a fact
that LeMarcus and the guys,

1:11:47.671 --> 1:11:49.339
they respect
the hell out of you,

1:11:49.473 --> 1:11:54.778
and you would be the first
African-American head coach

1:11:54.911 --> 1:11:59.683
to lead a team onto the field
for a national title game.

1:12:00.517 --> 1:12:02.118
Hell,

1:12:02.251 --> 1:12:04.488
hopefully win the thing, huh?

1:12:04.621 --> 1:12:06.856
Let's make history together.

1:12:24.107 --> 1:12:26.476
The NCAA may have started
with this...

1:12:26.610 --> 1:12:28.712
[Emmett groans]
...imaginary
pie-in-the-sky idea

1:12:28.845 --> 1:12:31.280
that it was about amateurism,
and at one point it was.

1:12:31.415 --> 1:12:34.818
But then there was a turn,
and it became about money.

1:12:34.951 --> 1:12:37.787
[knocking]
Plain and simple.
I thought this was America.

1:12:37.921 --> 1:12:39.656
[coughing]
Yeah?

1:12:39.789 --> 1:12:41.558
It's Coach Dunn.

1:12:43.259 --> 1:12:45.061
[Emmett] You all
by your lonesome?

1:12:45.194 --> 1:12:47.664
[groans]
[Coach Dunn]
It's just me.

1:12:47.797 --> 1:12:49.533
[door unlocks]

1:12:50.534 --> 1:12:51.568
Coach?

1:12:51.701 --> 1:12:54.370
You two are really hard
to find.

1:12:54.504 --> 1:12:57.340
It's easier to find Bigfoot
than to find you two.

1:12:58.341 --> 1:13:00.043
Look, relax.
I won't tell Lazor.

1:13:01.010 --> 1:13:02.846
[chuckles softly]
You know something?

1:13:02.979 --> 1:13:05.381
I gotta give credit
to you two, actually.

1:13:05.515 --> 1:13:08.051
I'm really surprised
you was able to pull this off.

1:13:10.086 --> 1:13:11.788
But you got trouble.

1:13:12.989 --> 1:13:15.091
Yep, they still gonna
play the game.

1:13:17.561 --> 1:13:19.095
With 19 freshmen?

1:13:19.996 --> 1:13:21.531
Cornelius?

1:13:21.665 --> 1:13:23.366
They don't care who plays
as long as it's on TV.

1:13:23.500 --> 1:13:25.569
[Emmett scoffs]

1:13:25.702 --> 1:13:27.571
The shit bowl.

1:13:27.704 --> 1:13:29.706
[Coach Dunn] They shitting
their pants right now.

1:13:29.839 --> 1:13:31.875
They got so desperate,
they approached me

1:13:32.008 --> 1:13:33.943
and said
If Lazor doesn't show up,

1:13:34.077 --> 1:13:36.012
I can bring the team
out to the field.

1:13:37.180 --> 1:13:39.082
So, Coach is sitting?

1:13:39.215 --> 1:13:41.084
[sighs] I don't know, man.
It's really hard
to tell right now,

1:13:41.217 --> 1:13:42.919
but it looks like it.

1:13:43.052 --> 1:13:44.020
Damn.

1:13:44.153 --> 1:13:46.322
So, what you gonna do?

1:13:46.456 --> 1:13:48.992
The first Black head coach
in a national title game?

1:13:49.125 --> 1:13:50.827
It's a big deal.

1:13:52.095 --> 1:13:55.331
I ain't no fucking pawn.
Hell, no, I'm not doing it.

1:13:55.465 --> 1:13:57.433
I'm one of best defensive
coaches in this country.

1:13:57.567 --> 1:13:58.935
I don't need
no fucking handouts.

1:13:59.068 --> 1:14:00.470
Amen, Coach.

1:14:00.604 --> 1:14:02.071
We feel the same way.

1:14:02.205 --> 1:14:04.340
Even if this whole thing
goes up in a ball of flames,

1:14:04.474 --> 1:14:06.242
we're not stepping
on that field.

1:14:08.745 --> 1:14:11.581
Look, y'all.
Have I ever told you
the Hannibal Lawson story?

1:14:11.715 --> 1:14:13.850
Who?
Hannibal Lawson.

1:14:13.983 --> 1:14:17.053
So, Han Lawson, to me, was one
of the best defensive tackles

1:14:17.186 --> 1:14:18.922
in Louisiana
high school history.

1:14:19.055 --> 1:14:20.824
He went on to LSU.

1:14:20.957 --> 1:14:22.926
You know, a bright future.

1:14:24.027 --> 1:14:25.762
He got his knee shredded
in practice.

1:14:25.895 --> 1:14:28.598
And the result of that,
they took his scholarship away.

1:14:30.900 --> 1:14:32.769
But Hannibal did
something interesting.

1:14:32.902 --> 1:14:35.805
He hired
a lawyer in a cheap suit
with some night-school degree,

1:14:35.939 --> 1:14:38.675
and he sued the NCAA
for workmen's comp.

1:14:38.808 --> 1:14:40.677
-Smart, right?
-Yeah.

1:14:40.810 --> 1:14:43.112
Went all the way to
the Louisiana Supreme Court.

1:14:43.246 --> 1:14:44.914
[Emmett] What happened?

1:14:45.048 --> 1:14:46.816
Student-athlete.

1:14:46.950 --> 1:14:49.285
[Coach Dunn]
Yeah, they said he was nothing
but a student-athlete.

1:14:49.418 --> 1:14:51.454
They didn't consider him
an employee, even though
they were selling

1:14:51.588 --> 1:14:53.222
hundreds and thousands
of tickets

1:14:53.356 --> 1:14:55.892
every fucking Saturday,
making millions of dollars!

1:14:56.025 --> 1:14:59.529
You're breaking your body
every fucking practice
and every game.

1:14:59.663 --> 1:15:02.298
And whenever they decide
to take the scholarship
away from you, they can,

1:15:02.431 --> 1:15:03.967
whenever the fuck
they feel like it.

1:15:04.100 --> 1:15:06.903
That's a crazy,
sick system.

1:15:07.036 --> 1:15:10.206
And maybe you two
will change it.
I don't know.

1:15:10.339 --> 1:15:13.977
But I want y'all to understand
something. There's a lot
of Han Lawsons out here.

1:15:15.211 --> 1:15:16.646
Survival of the fittest.

1:15:18.347 --> 1:15:20.116
America.

1:15:21.585 --> 1:15:23.553
This little pigskin football
right here

1:15:23.687 --> 1:15:25.054
holds a lot of weight to it.

1:15:25.188 --> 1:15:26.956
It's more than a game.

1:15:27.090 --> 1:15:28.892
It's a fucking business.

1:15:33.429 --> 1:15:34.798
Hey, Coach.

1:15:35.832 --> 1:15:37.567
Thank you.

1:15:38.534 --> 1:15:40.003
Good luck, fellas.

1:15:41.304 --> 1:15:43.206
[coughs]

1:15:46.342 --> 1:15:48.544
[sighs]
[door closes]

1:15:48.678 --> 1:15:50.513
We're gonna need Cecil
on board.

1:15:50.647 --> 1:15:54.183
We both don't play,
the advertisers
will start pulling out.

1:15:55.518 --> 1:15:56.920
It's the only way.

1:15:57.921 --> 1:16:00.023
[blues rock music playing]

1:16:00.156 --> 1:16:02.358
[Rodgers] Take a little more
of the edge off.

1:16:04.260 --> 1:16:06.395
Gotta let it out.

1:16:06.529 --> 1:16:09.398
If you don't,
it just stays inside you,
it becomes poison.

1:16:09.532 --> 1:16:11.234
[Taylor sighs]

1:16:11.367 --> 1:16:14.070
Okay, what's the plan?
Damn it.

1:16:14.203 --> 1:16:16.139
I can't even focus
on that right now.

1:16:16.272 --> 1:16:19.575
Well, you... you got to.
You gotta bifurcate.

1:16:19.709 --> 1:16:23.947
Uh, I don't know what
that means, but I think
I get the gist of it.

1:16:24.080 --> 1:16:25.915
About to lose 500,000
'cause of LeMarcus.

1:16:26.049 --> 1:16:27.116
[Rodgers] Taylor.
He fucked us.

1:16:27.250 --> 1:16:28.551
-Put the phone down.
-He fucked us.

1:16:28.685 --> 1:16:30.353
-Put the phone down.
-All right.

1:16:30.486 --> 1:16:33.022
Coach, I know you don't want
to hear this right now.

1:16:33.156 --> 1:16:36.092
I've been married
three times myself.

1:16:36.225 --> 1:16:38.394
But the hurt goes away.

1:16:38.527 --> 1:16:39.796
Poof.

1:16:39.929 --> 1:16:41.965
One day, just like that.
Gone.

1:16:42.098 --> 1:16:44.801
I'm telling you,
Bailey's my one and only.

1:16:44.934 --> 1:16:47.937
And she's gone.
And it's my own goddamn fault.

1:16:48.071 --> 1:16:49.639
[Taylor] Coach,
no offense at all.

1:16:49.773 --> 1:16:51.708
Your love life,
that's your thing.

1:16:51.841 --> 1:16:53.309
Your racial views,
that's your thing.

1:16:53.442 --> 1:16:55.845
But we have
a national title
in less than 24 hours.

1:16:55.979 --> 1:16:58.281
Can you please
just focus on that?
Fucking racial views?

1:16:58.414 --> 1:16:59.916
First of all,
one goddamn reporter

1:17:00.049 --> 1:17:01.484
baits me into saying
something stupid.

1:17:01.617 --> 1:17:03.119
I know
you're not racist.

1:17:03.252 --> 1:17:04.854
I'm just saying we got
the game to focus on, okay?

1:17:04.988 --> 1:17:06.690
That's all I'm saying.
What fucking game?

1:17:06.823 --> 1:17:08.792
I don't have
a goddamn team.
Less than 24 hours.

1:17:08.925 --> 1:17:12.128
I'm supposed
to walk out of that tunnel
with-- with freshmen.

1:17:12.261 --> 1:17:14.698
Nobody's askin' you...
and go in there and get
our ass kicked?

1:17:14.831 --> 1:17:17.533
You gotta figure it out.
That's not competition.
That's a fucking slaughter.

1:17:17.667 --> 1:17:19.168
I'm doing what I can.

1:17:19.302 --> 1:17:21.270
You gotta do better, Coach.
You're under contract.

1:17:21.404 --> 1:17:23.106
Con...
Fuck that contract.

1:17:23.239 --> 1:17:25.675
Are you talking to me
about the fucking contract
right now?

1:17:25.809 --> 1:17:27.310
I could walk
across the street tomorrow

1:17:27.443 --> 1:17:29.312
and get another contract
if they find me in breach.

1:17:29.445 --> 1:17:31.681
I don't give a shit.
I don't need
the goddamn money anyway.

1:17:31.815 --> 1:17:33.182
Coach,
you're hurtin' right now.

1:17:33.316 --> 1:17:36.519
Let's just give it
an hour or two.

1:17:36.652 --> 1:17:38.321
See the state of play.

1:17:38.454 --> 1:17:41.624
It's best not to make
any decisions feeling this way.

1:17:43.159 --> 1:17:44.694
Tell you what.
It's the ones

1:17:44.828 --> 1:17:47.630
that are closest to us
that hurt us the most.

1:18:06.449 --> 1:18:08.852
You as good
as they say you are?

1:18:08.985 --> 1:18:11.687
To which of my many talents
are you referring?

1:18:12.989 --> 1:18:15.391
There was a fight
that no one knows about.

1:18:15.524 --> 1:18:17.861
A real brawl.
A kid got hurt bad.

1:18:17.994 --> 1:18:21.197
I'll alert the authorities.
Oh, they know.

1:18:21.330 --> 1:18:24.734
He's blind in one eye now
and got a hole in his skull.

1:18:26.402 --> 1:18:29.405
But money talks,
and NDAs don't.

1:18:34.610 --> 1:18:36.045
I'm listening.

1:18:38.815 --> 1:18:40.183
LeMarcus.

1:18:42.285 --> 1:18:43.519
[shower running]

1:18:43.652 --> 1:18:46.422
[practicing Italian]

1:18:46.555 --> 1:18:49.325
Oh, crap,
I think I just called you
my pistachio. [laughs]

1:18:49.458 --> 1:18:52.929
Your phone sucks.
Is mine in there?

1:18:53.062 --> 1:18:54.663
It is here.

1:18:54.798 --> 1:18:56.532
[Bailey] Ah.

1:18:56.665 --> 1:18:59.803
You just got a text
from a guy
named Mike Titus.

1:18:59.936 --> 1:19:01.771
What? Crap.

1:19:01.905 --> 1:19:05.374
I just must have grabbed
James' personal one again
by accident.

1:19:05.508 --> 1:19:09.312
[Italian accent]
Can you bring it to me,
mi pistachio?

1:19:10.746 --> 1:19:12.782
It's probably goin' ape-shit
right now.

1:19:12.916 --> 1:19:14.918
After everything we've done
for LeMarcus.

1:19:15.051 --> 1:19:18.387
Every single one of those kids
are spoiled brats.

1:19:18.521 --> 1:19:20.423
Spoiled freaking brats.

1:19:20.556 --> 1:19:22.959
Geez. [chuckles]

1:19:23.092 --> 1:19:27.130
Oh, I cannot wait
to go to Rome.

1:19:27.263 --> 1:19:30.099
There's this one place
that I want to eat at,

1:19:30.233 --> 1:19:33.402
and they still have
the bullet holes
in the walls from the war.

1:19:33.536 --> 1:19:37.073
Do you see this?
Probably not,
'cause your phone stinks.

1:19:40.844 --> 1:19:41.945
What?

1:19:44.848 --> 1:19:46.782
I've been helping LeMarcus.

1:19:49.518 --> 1:19:51.254
What?

1:19:51.387 --> 1:19:53.156
You know, with his boycott.

1:19:53.289 --> 1:19:54.891
That's why I'm here.

1:19:56.525 --> 1:19:58.327
I don't get it.

1:20:00.329 --> 1:20:02.665
He came to me after class.

1:20:03.666 --> 1:20:05.134
And... [sighs]

1:20:06.235 --> 1:20:07.770
...what was I gonna do?

1:20:08.737 --> 1:20:10.706
Be another
tenured paper tiger?

1:20:12.275 --> 1:20:14.377
Teaching organized labor
five days a week,

1:20:14.510 --> 1:20:16.880
then hide behind my desk
when one of my own students

1:20:17.013 --> 1:20:19.182
actually wants
to do something about it?

1:20:21.084 --> 1:20:22.852
So...

1:20:22.986 --> 1:20:24.353
I helped him

1:20:25.488 --> 1:20:27.456
with his strategy

1:20:28.257 --> 1:20:29.893
any way I could.

1:20:31.961 --> 1:20:33.096
It's funny.

1:20:33.229 --> 1:20:35.331
LeMarcus knew
the rumors about us,

1:20:35.464 --> 1:20:37.200
like everybody else.

1:20:37.333 --> 1:20:39.135
Except your husband,
of course.

1:20:40.436 --> 1:20:43.672
And you, calling LeMarcus
a spoiled brat,

1:20:44.640 --> 1:20:48.211
especially when he has
so much to lose.

1:20:50.146 --> 1:20:53.682
Maybe you're more part
of the system than you think.
Get out.

1:20:55.818 --> 1:20:57.987
[voice breaking]
Get the fuck out of here.

1:21:02.658 --> 1:21:03.927
Leave!

1:21:14.670 --> 1:21:16.039
[door closes]

1:21:19.008 --> 1:21:20.076
[sobs]

1:21:27.016 --> 1:21:28.717
[whispers] Fuck me.

1:21:28.851 --> 1:21:30.019
[sobs]

1:21:47.971 --> 1:21:49.538
[knocking]

1:21:54.010 --> 1:21:55.678
[sighs]

1:22:05.588 --> 1:22:07.790
Oh, sorry. I think
we got the wrong room.

1:22:07.923 --> 1:22:09.792
No.
This room is Cecil's.

1:22:09.925 --> 1:22:12.261
Come in.
We don't have a lot of time.

1:22:20.569 --> 1:22:23.139
My name's Katherine Poe.
I come bearing gifts.

1:22:23.272 --> 1:22:25.241
You need my phone?

1:22:28.711 --> 1:22:30.013
You look rough.

1:22:30.146 --> 1:22:32.281
Just a cold.

1:22:32.415 --> 1:22:33.916
Where's Cecil?

1:22:34.050 --> 1:22:36.652
They're in a suite
ten floors up, playing 2K.

1:22:38.121 --> 1:22:39.588
No, wait.

1:22:39.722 --> 1:22:42.058
[chuckles] You haven't
even heard my offer yet.

1:22:42.191 --> 1:22:44.793
It's a pretty good offer.
A lot of wonderful things.

1:22:44.927 --> 1:22:46.662
A lot of meat
on the bone.

1:22:51.867 --> 1:22:53.436
Okay.

1:22:53.569 --> 1:22:55.404
What you got?

1:22:55.538 --> 1:22:57.840
I send the best concierge
doctor in New Orleans,

1:22:57.973 --> 1:22:59.608
Dr. Eric, to your room.

1:22:59.742 --> 1:23:03.179
He gives you an IV, a Z-Pak,
you get plenty of rest,

1:23:03.312 --> 1:23:05.481
you and your team
play the game,

1:23:06.815 --> 1:23:08.951
and you go number one
overall in April.

1:23:09.085 --> 1:23:10.486
All your dreams
come true.

1:23:10.619 --> 1:23:12.221
And...

1:23:12.355 --> 1:23:15.158
I will personally
make sure

1:23:15.291 --> 1:23:18.694
that the NCAA forms
an exploratory committee

1:23:18.827 --> 1:23:21.964
to fully monetize
amateur athletics.

1:23:22.098 --> 1:23:24.400
"Exploratory committee"?
Yeah, that's gonna
be a pass.

1:23:24.533 --> 1:23:27.536
[Katherine] No, wait.
You haven't heard
the cherry on top.

1:23:28.804 --> 1:23:30.973
Best part is,
you don't go to jail.

1:23:32.875 --> 1:23:35.211
[scoffs] For boycottin'
a football game?

1:23:35.344 --> 1:23:38.547
For the attempted murder
of K.C. Walton.

1:23:43.586 --> 1:23:44.953
[Emmett] Wow.

1:23:45.988 --> 1:23:47.890
Wow!

1:23:48.023 --> 1:23:51.460
For the last 48 hours,
you guys have been trying
to destroy this man!

1:23:51.594 --> 1:23:53.896
And what, you land
on outright assassination?

1:23:54.029 --> 1:23:57.233
For what, money?
K.C. Walton is blind
in one eye.

1:23:57.366 --> 1:23:59.402
He has a crack
in his skull,

1:23:59.535 --> 1:24:03.739
and he hasn't walked the same
ever since that fight
outside of the, uh,

1:24:03.872 --> 1:24:06.842
Gin Mill Bar and Grill.

1:24:08.877 --> 1:24:10.913
So I spoke to his mother,

1:24:11.046 --> 1:24:12.848
and she jumped at the idea
of being able to...
[whispers] It's bullshit.

1:24:12.981 --> 1:24:15.118
It's not bullshit!

1:24:15.251 --> 1:24:18.454
She jumped at the idea
of being able
to throw out that NDA

1:24:18.587 --> 1:24:21.357
and burn that 100K
that was used to buy them off

1:24:21.490 --> 1:24:23.926
if it meant that
she could find the guys

1:24:24.059 --> 1:24:26.929
who hurt her son
and get paid again.

1:24:27.062 --> 1:24:29.932
You don't know
what you're doing.
Hey. No.

1:24:31.200 --> 1:24:32.568
She ain't got nothin'.

1:24:32.701 --> 1:24:34.370
Let's get outta here.

1:24:36.339 --> 1:24:37.773
I got Reggie.

1:24:41.510 --> 1:24:43.179
Your half-brother.

1:24:48.184 --> 1:24:49.618
So you spoke to him?

1:24:51.187 --> 1:24:53.256
Haven't found him yet.

1:24:53.389 --> 1:24:56.859
When I do, I promise you,
I am going to piece together

1:24:56.992 --> 1:24:59.395
what exactly happened
that night.

1:24:59.528 --> 1:25:02.131
LeMarcus, wake up.

1:25:03.566 --> 1:25:06.369
How do you think
it is gonna look
when someone like Reggie,

1:25:06.502 --> 1:25:09.071
who has two felony
possession charges

1:25:09.205 --> 1:25:11.140
and assault and battery,
shows up

1:25:11.274 --> 1:25:13.342
in front of an all-white jury
in Missouri

1:25:13.476 --> 1:25:14.977
with
attempted-murder charges

1:25:15.110 --> 1:25:18.080
to a guy who is
permanently injured?

1:25:19.315 --> 1:25:21.317
One look at that jack,
and I'd be able to know

1:25:21.450 --> 1:25:23.352
that he was the one
that kicked K.C.'s ass.

1:25:24.287 --> 1:25:26.589
But guess what?
This is America.

1:25:26.722 --> 1:25:29.192
[whispers] Nobody cares
about your brother.

1:25:29.892 --> 1:25:30.959
Nobody.

1:25:32.728 --> 1:25:35.698
[normal voice] The only one
they were able to spot
that night in that melee

1:25:35.831 --> 1:25:39.702
was one LeMarcus James,
star quarterback.

1:25:39.835 --> 1:25:42.104
And so the state police
picked you up

1:25:42.238 --> 1:25:43.639
and hit you with charges,

1:25:43.772 --> 1:25:45.674
but some
deep-pocketed booster,

1:25:45.808 --> 1:25:47.910
who I think
I just fucking met,

1:25:48.043 --> 1:25:49.111
stepped in

1:25:49.245 --> 1:25:51.814
and paid off K.C.
and his family.

1:25:51.947 --> 1:25:53.949
Because that's what we do
in big football, right?

1:25:54.082 --> 1:25:56.585
You protect the phenom

1:25:56.719 --> 1:26:00.356
when he has a chance
of bringing home that
national title this year.

1:26:00.489 --> 1:26:02.358
Sound about right?

1:26:03.959 --> 1:26:07.796
I suggest you let
Dr. Eric patch you up tonight,

1:26:07.930 --> 1:26:11.467
and then we do
a joint press conference
in the morning.

1:26:11.600 --> 1:26:15.338
All the head honchos
up in the penthouse,

1:26:15.471 --> 1:26:17.139
heads bowed,

1:26:17.273 --> 1:26:19.808
agreeing that,
yes, there is a problem.

1:26:21.510 --> 1:26:23.178
And then you play.

1:26:23.312 --> 1:26:26.649
You win, and you get
to take that victory lap

1:26:26.782 --> 1:26:29.418
you have been
dreaming about since...

1:26:29.552 --> 1:26:31.854
since you stood
on the sidelines

1:26:31.987 --> 1:26:34.657
watching your big brother
in north Virginia.

1:26:36.191 --> 1:26:40.429
And then change does come
because of you, eventually.

1:26:40.563 --> 1:26:43.599
And that is something
you both can be proud of.

1:26:44.567 --> 1:26:47.236
I got a question.

1:26:47.370 --> 1:26:50.406
Are you completely
fucking heartless,
or just a little bit?

1:26:50.539 --> 1:26:53.041
Oh, my God.
[Emmett] How do you live
with yourself?

1:26:53.175 --> 1:26:56.979
Honestly, how do you live
with yourself?
[shouts] I am not heartless!

1:26:57.112 --> 1:26:58.981
You do not know me!

1:27:00.683 --> 1:27:03.486
You think I don't know
your struggle?

1:27:03.619 --> 1:27:07.290
You think I don't know
what you have come from?
That I haven't been there?

1:27:08.357 --> 1:27:10.058
You think I don't know
what it's like

1:27:10.192 --> 1:27:12.227
to be without heat
in your house?

1:27:12.361 --> 1:27:13.862
That I don't know
what it's like

1:27:13.996 --> 1:27:16.164
to not be able
to afford your jersey,

1:27:16.299 --> 1:27:17.800
and you are
avoiding your coach

1:27:17.933 --> 1:27:20.536
'cause you don't have
the $50 to pay for it?

1:27:22.237 --> 1:27:24.940
[voice breaking]
I ran track at Duke, okay?

1:27:26.375 --> 1:27:27.743
Full ride.

1:27:27.876 --> 1:27:29.812
No big medals, no big wins.

1:27:29.945 --> 1:27:33.282
But I took that money
because it was the only way
I was gonna run myself

1:27:33.416 --> 1:27:36.151
out of that
Red Hook project.

1:27:36.285 --> 1:27:38.887
[scoffs]
You think you know me.

1:27:40.255 --> 1:27:42.124
You don't know me.

1:27:42.257 --> 1:27:46.094
I had to fight and climb

1:27:46.228 --> 1:27:48.564
and crawl to be here

1:27:48.697 --> 1:27:50.699
because I did the work.

1:27:54.036 --> 1:27:59.074
The NCAA spends $3.6 billion

1:27:59.207 --> 1:28:02.778
on student-athlete
scholarships for kids like me,

1:28:02.911 --> 1:28:05.414
like you and like you,

1:28:06.782 --> 1:28:08.984
so that we can get a leg up.

1:28:09.117 --> 1:28:11.053
And what happens
to all of that

1:28:12.120 --> 1:28:14.122
when they start paying you?

1:28:14.256 --> 1:28:15.724
Hmm?

1:28:15.858 --> 1:28:20.095
What happens to volleyball
in Minnesota,

1:28:20.228 --> 1:28:22.130
to soccer in Idaho,

1:28:22.264 --> 1:28:24.433
to softball in South Carolina?

1:28:24.567 --> 1:28:26.935
What happens to
all of those other sports

1:28:27.069 --> 1:28:30.673
that are not men's football
and basketball?

1:28:32.675 --> 1:28:36.211
You out here fighting,
and you forgot
who you're fighting for.

1:28:38.781 --> 1:28:41.850
You know, but...
[clears throat, sighs]

1:28:42.951 --> 1:28:44.653
Hey, what do I know?

1:28:45.821 --> 1:28:47.289
I'm heartless.

1:29:00.736 --> 1:29:02.270
[door opens]

1:29:04.006 --> 1:29:05.474
[door closes]

1:29:09.111 --> 1:29:11.313
[crowd chattering]

1:29:24.627 --> 1:29:27.930
[on TV] Hi, everybody, and
good morning from the Big Easy.
I'm Steve Levy.

1:29:28.063 --> 1:29:29.698
We are some 12 hours away

1:29:29.832 --> 1:29:32.535
from tonight's Snickers
National Title game.

1:29:32.668 --> 1:29:34.703
Now, I'm being told
that a midnight deal

1:29:34.837 --> 1:29:37.372
may have been brokered
with LeMarcus James.

1:29:37.506 --> 1:29:40.275
Details still remain
a little bit sketchy,

1:29:40.409 --> 1:29:43.546
but there's
a news conference scheduled
for a couple hours from now.

1:29:43.679 --> 1:29:45.748
My sources tell me
that both teams

1:29:45.881 --> 1:29:47.382
could be
at full strength tonight,

1:29:47.516 --> 1:29:49.685
and that includes James.

1:29:49.818 --> 1:29:51.620
You know what else
that means?

1:29:51.754 --> 1:29:54.423
Strike up the band.
Fire up that old grill.

1:29:54.557 --> 1:29:56.992
We're gonna have some great
football action for you to--

1:29:57.125 --> 1:30:00.228
The 13-1 Cougars
against the undefeated Wolves,

1:30:00.362 --> 1:30:01.897
the two best players
in the country...

1:30:02.030 --> 1:30:04.600
Or will it?
Even with the rumors

1:30:04.733 --> 1:30:06.735
of a late-night deal
with LeMarcus James,

1:30:06.869 --> 1:30:10.205
many oddsmakers still doubt
he will actually play tonight.

1:30:10.338 --> 1:30:13.008
So the question is,
can James Lazor's Wolves

1:30:13.141 --> 1:30:15.010
win without
their star quarterback?

1:30:15.143 --> 1:30:16.612
I'm not so sure.

1:30:16.745 --> 1:30:20.348
Well, yeah.
He and LeMarcus
have the same mother.

1:30:20.483 --> 1:30:22.284
Yeah, they both grew up
in Virginia.

1:30:22.417 --> 1:30:25.454
Reggie,
he played JUCO football,

1:30:25.588 --> 1:30:27.289
but that fizzled out
after they cut him

1:30:27.422 --> 1:30:29.424
for having
too many concussions.

1:30:29.558 --> 1:30:31.426
I would start
with the state prisons.

1:30:31.560 --> 1:30:33.596
Even try
mental health facilities.

1:30:33.729 --> 1:30:35.831
We need to do
a social media backdoor too.

1:30:35.964 --> 1:30:37.766
I doubt that
he even has an account,

1:30:37.900 --> 1:30:40.135
but we have got to find him.
[knocking]

1:30:41.369 --> 1:30:43.138
He is our pressure point.

1:30:43.271 --> 1:30:45.608
Oh. Coach.

1:30:48.076 --> 1:30:49.645
I got your message.

1:30:53.649 --> 1:30:55.951
This thing
we're toying with,

1:30:57.620 --> 1:30:59.922
it's Pandora's box,
you know?

1:31:01.123 --> 1:31:02.290
I know.

1:31:02.424 --> 1:31:03.959
Nobody gets hurt.

1:31:05.193 --> 1:31:06.662
Nobody goes to jail.

1:31:06.795 --> 1:31:09.798
We just play this game.
That's what we all want.

1:31:17.773 --> 1:31:19.942
[coughing]

1:31:20.075 --> 1:31:22.110
[Emmett] Dear Lord,

1:31:22.244 --> 1:31:25.313
the trees are thick,
and we've yet to see a path
through the wilderness.

1:31:26.849 --> 1:31:28.617
Send us a light.

1:31:28.751 --> 1:31:30.953
Show us the way.
Amen.

1:31:31.086 --> 1:31:33.388
Amen. [coughing]

1:31:36.124 --> 1:31:39.327
I can't believe you've
been here this whole time
and didn't tell us.

1:31:39.461 --> 1:31:42.064
What? You thought I was
gonna miss the show?

1:31:42.197 --> 1:31:44.366
[LeMarcus chuckles quietly]

1:31:44.499 --> 1:31:45.901
I'm sorry.

1:31:46.034 --> 1:31:48.170
No, hey, you don't
owe me anything.

1:31:48.303 --> 1:31:50.673
You're the one, the two of you,
who had the guts and vision--

1:31:50.806 --> 1:31:53.008
I meant about her.

1:31:54.109 --> 1:31:56.178
Oh. [inhales sharply]

1:31:56.311 --> 1:31:57.780
Yeah. Her.

1:31:58.781 --> 1:31:59.982
Well...

1:32:00.115 --> 1:32:01.216
[inhales sharply]

1:32:01.349 --> 1:32:03.451
I made my own bed
on that one, so...

1:32:03.586 --> 1:32:05.888
"Thou shalt
not commit adultery"

1:32:06.021 --> 1:32:07.623
is the seventh Commandment.

1:32:10.959 --> 1:32:13.361
Thank you
for clarifying that, Emmett.

1:32:14.496 --> 1:32:16.164
You're welcome.

1:32:16.298 --> 1:32:19.301
[LeMarcus] Look, Elliott,
we can't thank you enough, man.

1:32:19.434 --> 1:32:22.137
Without you, we--
[sighs]

1:32:22.270 --> 1:32:24.673
we wouldn't have even had
a shot to pull this off.

1:32:26.508 --> 1:32:28.210
What's going on here?

1:32:29.745 --> 1:32:31.614
Are we about to hold hands

1:32:31.747 --> 1:32:33.849
and feel good
about your little protest?

1:32:33.982 --> 1:32:36.551
'Cause I thought you guys
were in it to win it.

1:32:36.685 --> 1:32:38.553
You know,
as if it were, say,

1:32:38.687 --> 1:32:41.123
the national title.

1:32:46.695 --> 1:32:50.232
Let me give you a little
something I stumbled across
from my travels.

1:32:51.934 --> 1:32:54.436
I believe that's your coach's.

1:32:55.604 --> 1:32:57.405
Wasn't even wrapped
in aluminum.

1:32:57.539 --> 1:32:59.875
Amateur move.

1:33:01.644 --> 1:33:04.446
Yeah, but what's
the point of this?
We can't unlock it.

1:33:05.848 --> 1:33:08.784
Do you need to?
You know what's on it.

1:33:10.252 --> 1:33:13.521
And you're a quarterback.
You know how to bluff
the other team.

1:33:19.327 --> 1:33:20.863
So you're saying
we keep going?

1:33:20.996 --> 1:33:22.464
[Elliott]
That's not my decision.

1:33:22.597 --> 1:33:24.967
It's not even
about which one is right.

1:33:26.869 --> 1:33:29.537
It's about, which one
are you gonna be able
to live with,

1:33:29.672 --> 1:33:31.740
no matter how it goes,

1:33:31.874 --> 1:33:34.009
how much you suffer
the consequences.

1:33:37.112 --> 1:33:40.783
I'm just letting you know
you still have some options.

1:33:40.916 --> 1:33:44.419
[coughing]
It's off to Rome for me,
comrades.

1:33:44.552 --> 1:33:47.455
Wait, you ain't staying
for the game?
Nah, opiate for the masses.

1:33:47.589 --> 1:33:50.192
It's, like,
too much winning
for my taste.

1:33:53.495 --> 1:33:55.330
I'm so proud
of you guys.

1:33:57.132 --> 1:33:58.801
You did this.

1:33:58.934 --> 1:34:01.169
You alone.
And it was...

1:34:03.571 --> 1:34:05.507
It was
fucking magnificent.

1:34:08.877 --> 1:34:10.645
Veni, vidi...

1:34:10.779 --> 1:34:12.147
Vici.
Vici.

1:34:12.280 --> 1:34:14.082
[door closes]
[coughing]

1:34:15.450 --> 1:34:16.685
[LeMarcus] Goddamn.

1:34:16.819 --> 1:34:18.120
Well...

1:34:19.755 --> 1:34:21.924
we're about due
for our surrender.

1:34:23.058 --> 1:34:24.793
What you thinkin'?

1:34:25.593 --> 1:34:27.162
I don't fucking know.

1:34:28.130 --> 1:34:29.631
My head is pounding.

1:34:29.765 --> 1:34:32.200
Where's that doc?

1:34:32.334 --> 1:34:35.203
Yeah, I'll go get him.
He said he'd wait
in the lobby.

1:34:36.538 --> 1:34:37.706
[coughing]

1:34:37.840 --> 1:34:39.474
Damn, you sick.

1:34:39.607 --> 1:34:42.677
See if I can get you
another IV.
I'll be back in ten.

1:34:47.382 --> 1:34:48.851
[door closes]

1:35:53.782 --> 1:35:57.285
[Mike] As soon as
he gets here, we'll have
the coach and him reunite,

1:35:57.419 --> 1:36:01.123
uh, pleasantries, and then
we'll get right to inviting
the media in.

1:36:01.256 --> 1:36:03.758
I'll give them a few minutes.
They'll go off to play.

1:36:03.892 --> 1:36:05.493
[knocking on door]

1:36:05.627 --> 1:36:06.962
Here we go.

1:36:09.531 --> 1:36:10.698
[Everly] Hey!

1:36:10.833 --> 1:36:13.268
LeMarcus has risen.
There he is.

1:36:13.401 --> 1:36:15.938
All right.
Great to see you.

1:36:16.071 --> 1:36:18.073
Can I get you something?
Some water? A Snickers?

1:36:18.206 --> 1:36:20.075
-[laughter]
-I'm good, thanks.

1:36:20.208 --> 1:36:22.644
[Mike] You were a little
under the weather,
but you're better now.

1:36:22.777 --> 1:36:24.412
Yeah.

1:36:24.546 --> 1:36:26.714
[Mike] That's good news.
[Wes] Not for us.

1:36:26.849 --> 1:36:28.150
[laughter]

1:36:28.283 --> 1:36:30.118
[Everly] True.

1:36:30.252 --> 1:36:32.220
[Mike] Um,
I just wanted to, uh,

1:36:32.354 --> 1:36:34.489
get us to have
a little face-to-face

1:36:34.622 --> 1:36:36.258
before we bring
the cameras in here.

1:36:36.391 --> 1:36:38.260
I was just telling
the coach here

1:36:38.393 --> 1:36:40.762
how impressed I was
with, uh, your conduct.

1:36:40.896 --> 1:36:42.130
Very honorable.

1:36:43.231 --> 1:36:44.599
[Coach Lazor] LeMarcus.

1:36:44.732 --> 1:36:46.501
The team is back.

1:36:47.569 --> 1:36:49.371
They heard
about this deal, and...

1:36:50.338 --> 1:36:51.874
everybody else
is playin' this.

1:36:52.007 --> 1:36:53.475
It's just you
and Emmett now.

1:36:53.608 --> 1:36:57.212
These gentlemen are
giving you a committee,

1:36:57.345 --> 1:37:00.315
and they are gonna address
all of your grievances.

1:37:01.616 --> 1:37:02.951
So,

1:37:03.818 --> 1:37:06.188
time to put on
those pads,

1:37:06.321 --> 1:37:08.123
join your brothers,
and do battle.

1:37:09.124 --> 1:37:10.692
Everybody's countin'
on you.

1:37:12.427 --> 1:37:14.362
I'm countin' on you.

1:37:17.799 --> 1:37:19.667
You know, I assure you,
LeMarcus,

1:37:19.801 --> 1:37:21.603
this isn't
a ceremonial committee.

1:37:21.736 --> 1:37:23.838
We're gonna dig down
into these issues

1:37:23.972 --> 1:37:26.875
and figure out
what's best for all of us.

1:37:29.744 --> 1:37:31.346
All right?

1:37:31.479 --> 1:37:33.548
Like the coach said,
we have a game to play.

1:37:33.681 --> 1:37:35.683
Let's get the cameras in...
I didn't say yes.

1:37:37.019 --> 1:37:38.720
[Everly]
What's that?

1:37:39.654 --> 1:37:40.989
I didn't say yes.

1:37:43.325 --> 1:37:45.160
[sighs]

1:37:47.662 --> 1:37:49.564
What would it take
in your mind

1:37:50.465 --> 1:37:52.400
to get to yes?

1:37:54.569 --> 1:37:56.704
Well, our demands
haven't changed.

1:38:01.243 --> 1:38:03.211
[chuckles]

1:38:32.207 --> 1:38:34.109
[Katherine] That's
the sealed case file

1:38:34.242 --> 1:38:36.544
from that fateful night
at the Gin Mill.

1:38:39.314 --> 1:38:43.085
The detectives investigated
for two weeks, and then...

1:38:43.218 --> 1:38:44.652
[sighs]

1:38:44.786 --> 1:38:49.257
...suddenly, K.C. Walton
decided to drop the charges.

1:38:55.597 --> 1:38:58.500
A lot of movin' pieces
in there, LeMarcus.

1:38:59.467 --> 1:39:01.303
This thing is a minefield.

1:39:03.105 --> 1:39:05.407
You find my brother yet?
[Katherine]
Getting close.

1:39:05.540 --> 1:39:09.644
I'd really love
to stop the search
and just have a beer,

1:39:10.778 --> 1:39:12.514
watch a football game.

1:39:16.118 --> 1:39:18.253
Well, why don't
we tell 'em, Coach?

1:39:19.587 --> 1:39:21.123
We're a wolf pack, right?

1:39:23.091 --> 1:39:24.993
We hunt together,
we starve alone.

1:39:25.127 --> 1:39:26.894
Ain't that the creed
you always preach?

1:39:27.029 --> 1:39:30.465
Why don't we tell everybody
how high up this really goes?

1:39:30.598 --> 1:39:32.500
Stop. Just stop.

1:39:32.634 --> 1:39:35.570
Look, you come out
of this now,

1:39:35.703 --> 1:39:37.939
you're not just
a Heisman Trophy winner,

1:39:38.073 --> 1:39:40.008
NFL first-rounder.

1:39:41.576 --> 1:39:44.812
You're an icon now.
You've already
accomplished that.

1:39:44.946 --> 1:39:47.949
You're the Curt Flood
of collegiate athletics.

1:39:49.117 --> 1:39:51.286
You're making
history here already.

1:39:51.419 --> 1:39:53.121
They're gonna write books
about you.

1:39:53.255 --> 1:39:55.557
Now, don't throw
everything away for-for

1:39:55.690 --> 1:39:58.193
whatever this
self-righteous bullshit is.

1:39:58.326 --> 1:39:59.961
Come on, man.
You've worked too hard.

1:40:00.095 --> 1:40:01.329
[grunts softly]

1:40:01.463 --> 1:40:03.798
We've worked too hard
for this.

1:40:04.832 --> 1:40:07.001
Let's just go
fuckin' win this thing.

1:40:08.670 --> 1:40:10.138
[scoffs]

1:40:10.272 --> 1:40:11.306
Win.

1:40:13.175 --> 1:40:15.410
That's all that
really matters, right?

1:40:17.145 --> 1:40:18.613
Just win.

1:40:20.182 --> 1:40:22.117
So that's what I did.

1:40:22.250 --> 1:40:24.519
I won every damn game I could.

1:40:25.953 --> 1:40:27.789
Conference championships,

1:40:27.922 --> 1:40:30.458
Heisman Trophy--
I won and I won and I won.

1:40:30.592 --> 1:40:35.029
Until you were so blind,
you didn't even see the game
I was really playin'.

1:40:35.163 --> 1:40:37.465
You see,
in order to slay Goliath,

1:40:37.599 --> 1:40:40.402
you gotta do it
on the biggest stage
with the brightest lights.

1:40:40.535 --> 1:40:42.970
Millions of people,
an entire system,

1:40:43.105 --> 1:40:45.907
so desperate
for one more win,

1:40:46.040 --> 1:40:47.675
they'd do anything,
give anything.

1:40:47.809 --> 1:40:50.512
No matter how many bodies
you gotta stand on top of.

1:40:51.646 --> 1:40:53.915
And then you got
your professor

1:40:54.048 --> 1:40:55.750
who's fuckin'
the coach's wife...

1:40:58.019 --> 1:40:59.754
to give you
everything you need.

1:41:01.856 --> 1:41:03.591
And you win.

1:41:03.725 --> 1:41:05.960
-You motherfucker!
-[excited chattering]

1:41:06.094 --> 1:41:08.730
You ungrateful bi...
Coach, don't do it.

1:41:08.863 --> 1:41:11.699
Goddamn you,
you fucking ungrateful...

1:41:12.900 --> 1:41:15.870
Jesus fucking Christ,
LeMarcus.

1:41:16.003 --> 1:41:18.940
My wife! My wife!

1:41:22.644 --> 1:41:24.412
[quietly]
Oh, my God.

1:41:29.817 --> 1:41:33.255
Jesus Christ, man.
Everything we've been
through together...

1:41:35.423 --> 1:41:37.559
everything
I've done for you...

1:41:40.228 --> 1:41:43.198
You were a pimply faced
little 16-year-old boy,

1:41:44.566 --> 1:41:46.601
scared to leave home.

1:41:48.770 --> 1:41:51.139
And I looked your mother
in the eyes,

1:41:51.273 --> 1:41:54.342
and I said,
"I will take care
of your boy."

1:41:54.476 --> 1:41:56.644
And that's
what I've done.

1:41:59.814 --> 1:42:01.616
Treated you like my own.

1:42:03.251 --> 1:42:05.086
Like my own son.

1:42:10.492 --> 1:42:12.126
How could you...

1:42:12.260 --> 1:42:13.761
[sighs]

1:42:13.895 --> 1:42:15.763
Goddamn, LeMarcus.

1:42:15.897 --> 1:42:17.932
[breathes shakily] Why?

1:42:22.637 --> 1:42:24.606
For all the ones
to come, Coach.

1:42:25.940 --> 1:42:27.842
The ones
who ain't as fortunate.

1:42:29.611 --> 1:42:31.679
Get this broken system
unbroken.

1:42:33.981 --> 1:42:35.917
So no more of us
get banged up

1:42:36.050 --> 1:42:38.186
and forced back
into poverty,

1:42:39.554 --> 1:42:41.589
just like what happened
to Reggie.

1:42:44.459 --> 1:42:48.129
You were the only one
who knew about that file.

1:42:48.263 --> 1:42:51.466
And you stoop even lower,
and you bring Reggie
into this?

1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:54.902
What, to you he's just...

1:42:55.036 --> 1:42:57.639
he's just some pawn
that you can use against me?

1:43:00.007 --> 1:43:01.643
He was my brother.

1:43:04.479 --> 1:43:06.180
He was a human being.

1:43:09.551 --> 1:43:12.920
Reggie died four months ago
in Tallahassee.

1:43:15.022 --> 1:43:16.324
He took his own life.

1:43:16.458 --> 1:43:19.261
[quietly] Oh, Jesus. Fuck.

1:43:19.394 --> 1:43:22.230
Y'all didn't know.
And what's worse,
y'all don't even care.

1:43:24.332 --> 1:43:26.167
There's always
some new batch of kids

1:43:26.301 --> 1:43:29.036
that get you more wins
and get you more money.

1:43:33.007 --> 1:43:34.342
I am not your son.

1:43:35.810 --> 1:43:37.144
I'm a man.

1:43:39.547 --> 1:43:41.048
[sniffles]

1:43:42.984 --> 1:43:44.419
Yeah, you are.

1:43:49.524 --> 1:43:51.158
And I love you.

1:43:56.097 --> 1:43:58.132
But I got
a football game to win.

1:44:02.437 --> 1:44:04.071
[door opens]

1:44:05.440 --> 1:44:06.874
[door closes]

1:44:12.380 --> 1:44:14.416
[Mike clears throat]
Gentlemen, um,

1:44:14.549 --> 1:44:16.250
would you step out
for a minute?

1:44:17.385 --> 1:44:18.886
Give us some time?

1:44:20.254 --> 1:44:21.589
[sniffles]

1:44:39.374 --> 1:44:42.910
You open up that minefield,
it's gonna be more
than just me and Reggie.

1:44:44.178 --> 1:44:45.780
On Coach's phone,
we got emails

1:44:45.913 --> 1:44:48.049
from prosecutors,
law enforcement.

1:44:48.182 --> 1:44:50.718
All of 'em were involved
in the cover-up.

1:44:50.852 --> 1:44:53.087
Shoot, even the governor

1:44:53.220 --> 1:44:55.623
chest bumps
in the locker room
on game day.

1:44:57.392 --> 1:45:00.862
Coach's phone,
you'll find a text where
he promises to take care of it.

1:45:05.633 --> 1:45:07.001
The martyr.

1:45:08.336 --> 1:45:10.838
Willing to die
for the cause.

1:45:10.972 --> 1:45:13.675
I find that courageous.
Admirable.

1:45:15.076 --> 1:45:17.679
But what about Emmett Sunday?

1:45:18.813 --> 1:45:21.015
You said you were
doing this for him.

1:45:22.750 --> 1:45:24.151
Miss Poe?

1:45:36.163 --> 1:45:37.532
[Katherine clears throat]

1:45:37.665 --> 1:45:40.935
"It was chaos.
People everywhere.

1:45:41.068 --> 1:45:44.005
Then all of a sudden,
LeMarcus James,
the quarterback,

1:45:44.138 --> 1:45:46.974
showed up
with someone else.

1:45:48.510 --> 1:45:52.146
[clears throat] A big guy.
It was really dangerous.

1:45:52.279 --> 1:45:54.181
Then the big white guy

1:45:55.583 --> 1:45:58.052
flew through the crowd
and hit one guy

1:45:58.185 --> 1:46:01.355
who dropped like he was dead
and threw another guy
into a wall.

1:46:01.489 --> 1:46:04.659
LeMarcus grabbed the man
the crew were beating on,

1:46:04.792 --> 1:46:06.428
and everyone ran.

1:46:07.629 --> 1:46:10.231
Like I said,
it was chaos."
That was self-defense.

1:46:11.332 --> 1:46:13.401
[Mike]
Maybe so. Maybe so.

1:46:14.402 --> 1:46:15.703
But does it matter?

1:46:17.238 --> 1:46:19.707
We go down this road,

1:46:19.841 --> 1:46:21.909
they won't be putting you
on trial,

1:46:22.043 --> 1:46:24.712
they'll be putting
your best friend, Emmett.

1:46:25.847 --> 1:46:29.216
Now, do you have the stomach
to watch the sharks

1:46:29.350 --> 1:46:31.486
rip him apart limb by limb

1:46:31.619 --> 1:46:35.022
in front of the whole world
and leave him destroyed,

1:46:35.156 --> 1:46:36.323
canceled?

1:46:38.392 --> 1:46:40.428
LeMarcus,
you're standing toe-to-toe
with the behemoth,

1:46:40.562 --> 1:46:42.564
and we haven't even
begun to fight.

1:46:44.532 --> 1:46:46.768
College football is more
important than you,

1:46:46.901 --> 1:46:48.870
me, Emmett,

1:46:49.003 --> 1:46:51.038
or whatever really is
on that phone.

1:46:52.674 --> 1:46:54.676
The American people

1:46:54.809 --> 1:46:57.111
will let the state
of Missouri
fall under the sea

1:46:57.244 --> 1:46:58.846
rather than give up
Saturday afternoon,

1:46:58.980 --> 1:47:00.682
drunk and roaring
for their alma mater.

1:47:02.950 --> 1:47:04.952
We're inevitable
as the rain.

1:47:12.426 --> 1:47:14.662
Now, you gonna put
on that helmet or not?

1:47:23.270 --> 1:47:25.840
[crowd cheering]

1:47:29.276 --> 1:47:32.547
[sportscaster on TV] ...gearing
up for the college football
national title game.

1:47:32.680 --> 1:47:34.381
The fans are buzzing
with excitement...

1:47:34.516 --> 1:47:37.151
[Emmett] "Inevitable"?
Like what?

1:47:38.553 --> 1:47:39.887
The rain.

1:47:41.723 --> 1:47:44.091
"I'm inevitable
as the rain."

1:47:46.360 --> 1:47:48.630
Feels powerful.
Mm-hmm.

1:47:48.763 --> 1:47:50.397
It was.

1:47:54.802 --> 1:47:56.170
[bones popping]

1:47:56.303 --> 1:47:58.072
[sighs]

1:47:58.205 --> 1:48:01.142
Gonna have to drain
the fluid out of this
damn thing again.

1:48:04.912 --> 1:48:07.381
You look better. Lighter.

1:48:07.515 --> 1:48:09.450
Finally breathe
through my nose.

1:48:10.618 --> 1:48:13.821
By the way,
that Doc Holliday head fake,

1:48:13.955 --> 1:48:16.658
you playing like you were
on your deathbed,
was sure good.

1:48:17.592 --> 1:48:19.460
[scoffs]

1:48:19.594 --> 1:48:23.064
Lacked the nuance of Kilmer,
but, uh, I bought it.

1:48:24.031 --> 1:48:25.667
I'll be your Huckleberry.

1:48:25.800 --> 1:48:28.235
[both chuckle]

1:48:34.609 --> 1:48:36.844
You sure they didn't try
to use me against you?

1:48:36.978 --> 1:48:38.179
Nah.

1:48:39.614 --> 1:48:41.282
I swear.

1:48:41.415 --> 1:48:43.517
'Cause if I find out
that you were...

1:48:43.651 --> 1:48:45.219
Trust me.

1:48:45.352 --> 1:48:48.155
They know this fight hurts them
way more than it hurts us.

1:48:48.289 --> 1:48:52.026
All those people involved
in the cover-up,
they ain't doin' shit.

1:48:52.159 --> 1:48:55.362
[Levy] The Superdome
in New Orleans is ready
to explode with excitement.

1:48:55.496 --> 1:48:58.299
Tonight, it's the Snickers
National Title game.

1:48:58.432 --> 1:49:00.167
Hi, everybody,
and good evening.

1:49:00.301 --> 1:49:02.236
I'm Steve Levy,
along with Malcolm Jenkins,

1:49:02.369 --> 1:49:03.838
and this one has
all the makings.

1:49:03.971 --> 1:49:05.539
This could be a classic.
No.

1:49:05.673 --> 1:49:07.074
[Levy] We're talking about
for years to come...

1:49:07.208 --> 1:49:09.443
Leave it.
...for a variety
of reasons.

1:49:09.577 --> 1:49:11.378
A lot of the controversy
still looms

1:49:11.512 --> 1:49:13.581
with LeMarcus James bein'
missin' from the action,

1:49:13.715 --> 1:49:16.350
as he continues his fight
against the NCAA practices,

1:49:16.483 --> 1:49:18.753
a stance that has gone
crazy on social media...
Whoo. Yes, sir.

1:49:18.886 --> 1:49:20.622
...with the viral hashtag,
"Fix the System."

1:49:20.755 --> 1:49:22.790
[Levy] How about
one million tweets

1:49:22.924 --> 1:49:24.959
the last 12 hours alone?

1:49:25.092 --> 1:49:27.428
My sense is,
this is only the beginning.

1:49:27.561 --> 1:49:31.132
How do you think that translates
onto the field the next
60 minutes we'll see tonight?

1:49:31.265 --> 1:49:33.467
[Jenkins] I think
you'll see these coaches
have these teams prepared.

1:49:33.601 --> 1:49:35.402
These players have worked
so hard to get to this moment,

1:49:35.536 --> 1:49:37.071
that I think
they'll be focused...

1:49:37.204 --> 1:49:38.773
At least we made
some noise, right?

1:49:38.906 --> 1:49:40.775
...knowing that
this is everything...

1:49:40.908 --> 1:49:42.744
Oh, that wasn't just noise.

1:49:44.145 --> 1:49:46.247
The truth is out now
because of us.

1:49:47.414 --> 1:49:48.950
And they can't hide it.

1:49:50.317 --> 1:49:52.920
Now more people are gonna
stand up, a lot more.

1:49:54.021 --> 1:49:56.523
And they'll know
right where to hit 'em.

1:49:57.591 --> 1:49:58.760
Yeah.

1:50:00.662 --> 1:50:01.763
Yeah.

1:50:02.596 --> 1:50:03.931
Hell, yeah.

1:50:04.065 --> 1:50:06.734
Man, we're like the Rebels
in Rogue One.

1:50:09.370 --> 1:50:11.906
We die on the beach,

1:50:12.039 --> 1:50:15.142
but the plans
for the Death Star
make it off the island.

1:50:23.217 --> 1:50:25.486
Nothing is inevitable
except the truth.
