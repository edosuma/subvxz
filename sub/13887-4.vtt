01:08.637 --> 01:11.639
SCRAMBLE, SCRAMBLE. All hands on
deck, emergency drill, scramble!

01:15.634 --> 01:18.599
Er, perhaps you didn't
catch that. I said SCRAMBLE!

01:18.634 --> 01:20.635
Yeah, that'll be great
with bacon and beans, man.

01:22.337 --> 01:23.454
Look, Starbug is a blazing inferno,

01:23.455 --> 01:25.843
the engine room is
waist deep in rocket fuel

01:25.844 --> 01:29.633
and we're being attacked off the
starboard bow by an unidentified craft!

01:30.281 --> 01:31.016
Really?

01:31.017 --> 01:32.590
No, of course not really. It's a drill.

01:32.591 --> 01:35.010
We're pretending that Starbug
is on fire and under attack.

01:36.031 --> 01:38.025
And I'm pretending to scramble, man.

01:39.024 --> 01:43.024
Look, you've got 30 seconds to get out of
bed or I'm declaring you officially dead.

01:44.029 --> 01:45.025
Good, then we can rest in peace.

01:49.131 --> 01:51.995
Congratulations, scrambling
in a red alert situation,

01:51.996 --> 01:56.633
a new record time... 1 hour
17 minutes and 39 seconds.

01:57.037 --> 02:01.001
Check your screens, I'm getting something
up my left nostril and it's coming in fast.

02:01.036 --> 02:02.424
Umm, scans are all negative.

02:02.425 --> 02:05.332
At the risk of challenging
your olfactory excellence sir,

02:05.333 --> 02:07.036
perhaps a resmelling is in order.

02:08.038 --> 02:11.313
I'm telling you bud, my nostril
hairs are shimmying faster

02:11.314 --> 02:16.032
than a grass skirt on a fat Hawaain hula
hoop champion. There's something out there.

02:16.067 --> 02:17.033
Scans still dry.

02:17.046 --> 02:21.227
Wait a minute, getting something.
Major power surge off the port bow.

02:22.232 --> 02:24.229
He's right. Some kind of vessel.
It appears to be uncloaking.

02:25.227 --> 02:28.155
He's too damn close. That power
surge'll toss us around like

02:28.156 --> 02:31.227
we're a bead of sweat in an
aerobic teacher's buttock cleavage.

02:32.231 --> 02:33.229
Hang on here it comes.

02:35.226 --> 02:36.026
Damage report!

02:36.232 --> 02:39.224
Superficial, navicomps down,
slight rupture in fuel pipe 9...

02:39.225 --> 02:43.229
and somehow the pilot's headset has got
jammed on the country and western channel.

02:45.228 --> 02:46.226
Second wave coming!

02:51.029 --> 02:55.024
What's he thinking of, warping that
close to another vessel. DAMN SPACE HOG.

02:55.059 --> 02:58.028
My god, that's a Space Corp
external enforcement vehicle.

02:58.063 --> 02:58.989
What?

02:59.024 --> 03:00.026
The space filth!

03:01.027 --> 03:04.023
A computer controlled enforcement
probe. It's scanning us now.

03:05.021 --> 03:05.821
Incoming.

03:06.025 --> 03:10.423
Property corp space removing,
and equipment corp space damaging,

03:10.424 --> 03:15.024
ships corp space of series a looting
with charged formerly are you.

03:16.023 --> 03:18.717
The materialization must have
scrambled it's voice unit.

03:18.718 --> 03:22.025
It's making about as much sense as
a Japanese VCR instruction manual.

03:23.026 --> 03:24.022
Plead do you how?

03:25.021 --> 03:27.019
It's in reverse. How_do_you_plead?

03:28.023 --> 03:28.988
How do we plead to what?

03:29.023 --> 03:31.021
It's charging us with
looting space corp derelicts.

03:32.023 --> 03:33.324
But we don't loot space corp derelicts.

03:33.325 --> 03:35.026
We just hack our way in
and swipe what we *need*.

03:37.019 --> 03:39.021
If this goes to trial, I
demand seperate lawyers.

03:40.019 --> 03:41.174
What's the penalty for this?

03:41.175 --> 03:44.020
If it means wearing outfits with
arrows on, I'm committing suicide.

03:46.019 --> 03:48.913
Er, no sir. It means wearing outfits
with wings and haloes on, sir.

03:48.914 --> 03:50.919
The penalty is execution.

03:51.102 --> 03:53.099
Yeah. But if we admit it
it'll blow us out of the stars.

03:54.099 --> 03:54.899
Reccomendations?

03:55.103 --> 03:57.208
Suggest I take the rap for everyone sir.

03:57.209 --> 04:01.102
You can say I held you at gunpoint
and forced you to do my evil bidding.

04:02.097 --> 04:04.101
For god's sake, Kryten,
we can't let you do that!

04:04.136 --> 04:05.069
Really?

04:05.104 --> 04:09.098
Dream on, metal trash. Get your hands in
the air and step into that searchlight.

04:10.103 --> 04:12.070
Minute one have you.

04:12.105 --> 04:15.110
No choices then, we leg it.
Plot a course for scarper city.

04:16.096 --> 04:18.100
Sir, a class A enforcement
orb can easily outrun us.

04:18.529 --> 04:20.793
Take a look at your screens. We're
7 klicks away from the Gelf Zone.

04:20.793 --> 04:22.531
It wouldn't follow us in
there in a gazillion years.

04:23.528 --> 04:25.643
No, because gelfs are
untrustworthy scavengers

04:25.644 --> 04:27.533
with no regard for
life, law or property.

04:27.568 --> 04:28.530
Right! So we'll be safe.

04:29.526 --> 04:31.215
Lister, you've heard the stories!

04:31.216 --> 04:34.285
They skin human beings alive
and turn them into bean bags!

04:34.286 --> 04:37.407
Unless you want a triple
buttocked gelf sitting on your face

04:37.408 --> 04:41.347
for the rest of eternity and probing
your crevices for lost forks and biros,

04:41.348 --> 04:42.524
I suggest you rethink.

04:42.559 --> 04:45.853
It's the lesser of two evils sir,
in the absence of any sane plan,

04:45.854 --> 04:47.525
I suggest we go with Mr Lister's.

04:48.527 --> 04:52.528
Seconds 20 in firing commence
will I, reply a of absence in.

04:53.526 --> 04:54.529
Roughly translated... Hit the reheat.

04:55.529 --> 04:56.527
You don't have to tell me twice.

04:59.524 --> 05:00.525
Cat man, hit the reheat!

05:01.528 --> 05:03.526
Oh sorry. Looks like you
do have to tell me twice.

05:06.526 --> 05:08.488
Firing commence will I or halt.

05:08.523 --> 05:10.528
In which case...
boneybuts our move lets!

05:10.563 --> 05:11.543
Close comms.

05:11.578 --> 05:12.489
Comms closed.

05:12.524 --> 05:13.487
Gelf zone, 6 klicks and closing.

05:13.522 --> 05:15.523
Weapon lock registered.
Pulse missile launched.

05:15.558 --> 05:16.526
Impact in 10 seconds.

05:17.531 --> 05:18.526
That's it. We're platform shoes, man.

05:19.527 --> 05:20.521
Firing chaffe. Firing flares.

05:21.523 --> 05:22.323
Brace for impact.

05:23.522 --> 05:25.488
Missed us!

05:25.523 --> 05:26.486
Warning shot across the bows.

05:26.521 --> 05:28.525
We won't be so fortunate next time.

05:29.526 --> 05:31.525
Another lock, this time
it won't be a warning shot.

05:32.527 --> 05:33.327
Incoming pulse fire.

05:33.520 --> 05:34.320
Decoys launched.

05:34.522 --> 05:35.522
It's not going to be
enough. 6 seconds to impact.

05:36.525 --> 05:37.528
We've got to try and shake them off.

05:44.522 --> 05:45.520
We've lost it!

05:49.525 --> 05:52.521
Sorry. I was looking at the wrong panel.

05:59.533 --> 06:00.333
Damage Report!

06:00.519 --> 06:03.523
It's bad, looks like Starbugs been hit.

06:04.523 --> 06:05.521
Details, halibut breath!

06:06.524 --> 06:08.584
Well according to the
damage report machine,

06:08.585 --> 06:12.520
there's several small fires in the cockpit,
lots of smoke and the navicomp's fizzing.

06:15.521 --> 06:17.524
Oh damn, now the damage
report machine has exploded.

06:20.518 --> 06:21.318
*Another* lock on!

06:21.519 --> 06:22.520
This one's to finish us off.

06:22.555 --> 06:23.521
How far to the Gelf Zone?

06:23.556 --> 06:24.523
Klick and a half.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.520
We've lost 3 fuel tanks, there's
barely enough to get us stable.

06:28.518 --> 06:29.519
Wait! I'm picking something up.

06:29.554 --> 06:30.520
Got it, putting it on visual.

06:32.521 --> 06:34.483
Look at that thing, it must
be a mile and a half across.

06:34.518 --> 06:38.520
A Gelf icon carved out of solid rock.
It must be some kind of warning beacon.

06:38.555 --> 06:39.516
Incoming message.

06:40.518 --> 06:43.518
Karn nes eh ping. Wah twah morah.

06:44.516 --> 06:45.483
Running it through the translator.

06:45.518 --> 06:49.515
This is gelf space.
Death to the strangers.

06:50.521 --> 06:52.521
Pulse missile launch impact
in 12 seconds and counting.

06:53.519 --> 06:54.522
Cat, head for the eye socket.

06:54.557 --> 06:55.520
The eye socket?

06:57.218 --> 06:58.018
Just do it!

06:58.214 --> 06:59.014
Eight seconds.

07:00.212 --> 07:01.012
It's solid rock.

07:01.210 --> 07:02.211
Three seconds.. two... one.

07:17.242 --> 07:19.222
It's waist high down there,
but at least I managed

07:19.223 --> 07:21.240
to get the pumps working.
3 hours and we'll be dry.

07:23.241 --> 07:26.953
Thrusters, boosters,reheat,
auto-repair can take care of everything,

07:26.954 --> 07:30.235
except for the oxygeneration
unit which is totally kaputzki.

07:30.270 --> 07:32.237
So you're telling me we can
take off but we can't breath?

07:33.237 --> 07:34.199
And we can't repair it?

07:34.234 --> 07:37.238
It's a black and charred mess, worse
than one of Lister's drunken fry-ups.

07:37.273 --> 07:40.235
Well, we're snookered. Unless we
go out and trade with the gelfs.

07:41.236 --> 07:42.036
Trade? You can't be serious.

07:43.236 --> 07:44.235
Sir, it does appear
to be our only option.

08:04.254 --> 08:08.813
I will tell them we are traders
in search of an engine part

08:08.814 --> 08:12.385
and that we have many
rare treasures to trade.

08:12.386 --> 08:16.259
Kinitawowi nhich nhichce
histan kanoa nakoo bacoo.

08:18.252 --> 08:20.256
Nuyer neeal deg dayer.

08:21.655 --> 08:29.609
Look, look what we got. We got
ehmm, swiss watches, nice watches.

08:29.610 --> 08:34.188
Levi jeans!. Hey! A hat, look at this.

08:34.190 --> 08:38.648
Hehehey nice hat. Cigar? Cool dude!

08:39.280 --> 08:41.383
Err, might I suggest caution sir,

08:41.384 --> 08:45.142
some gelfs have their sphinctral
orifices in their faces.

08:45.143 --> 08:49.283
Let's hope you haven't offended
him. No, he seems quite pleased.

08:50.285 --> 08:53.281
We need an oxygeneration unit, savvy?

08:53.316 --> 08:54.244
Uhh, unh?

08:54.279 --> 08:56.282
Agi gan bachwoo machuwahwah

08:57.280 --> 08:58.286
Alees tada.

08:59.279 --> 09:01.282
Cat, get the case man.

09:08.292 --> 09:09.297
It seems to be going well.

09:11.291 --> 09:12.001
What is that thing?

09:12.002 --> 09:16.918
It's an emohawk sir. A polymorph that is
spayed at birth and is half domesticated.

09:16.919 --> 09:19.939
It's trained to change
shape at it's owners behest

09:19.940 --> 09:22.604
like all polymorphs
it's an emotional leech,

09:22.605 --> 09:26.158
it has the ability to steal
emotions from living creatures.

09:26.159 --> 09:29.000
Emotions are a highly
valued trading commodity.

09:29.035 --> 09:30.965
Ahh, the oxygeneration unit.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.964
Looks like they are
ready to fix a price.

09:32.999 --> 09:35.966
I thought we'd already fixed a price with
all the bangles and baubles we'd given them.

09:36.001 --> 09:39.477
Oh no sir, that was just for the honour
of entering their watunga, or hut.

09:39.478 --> 09:41.007
The bartering proper begins now.

09:41.042 --> 09:45.003
Rec raht wig dig ana tut pata.

09:46.009 --> 09:46.997
Oh dear.

09:48.001 --> 09:49.966
What? What, you want my hat?

09:50.001 --> 09:53.971
Ahg nu dewka ana weg bah.

09:54.006 --> 09:55.505
My jacket? You want my *jacket*?

09:55.540 --> 09:57.004
No sir, he doesn't want your jacket.

09:58.003 --> 09:59.000
He doesn't want my longjohns does he?

09:59.035 --> 10:00.003
Not your longjohns either sir.

10:01.011 --> 10:01.962
Well what then?

10:01.997 --> 10:05.000
Ahg nu dewka ana weg bah.

10:06.999 --> 10:08.961
*ME*! He wants me?

10:08.996 --> 10:12.426
Yes sir, he says in exchange
for the oxygeneration unit

10:12.427 --> 10:14.999
he wants *you* to be
his daughter's mate.

10:16.998 --> 10:17.798
*That's* his daughter?

10:19.998 --> 10:22.004
One of three. Apparently
sir *she's* the looker.

10:25.001 --> 10:28.696
Tell him, not if she was the last
water yeti lookalike in the world

10:28.697 --> 10:30.000
and I was the only boy.

10:30.999 --> 10:33.004
Oh, come on, Lister, you've dated worse.

10:34.994 --> 10:35.995
Only due to very poor disco lighting.

10:37.995 --> 10:43.000
Ana beg ewitah og iy con nich kawal bah.

10:43.994 --> 10:45.995
He says: no wedding, no O G unit.

10:47.994 --> 10:51.995
Panta anag ew, panta wa ah.

10:52.995 --> 10:54.994
Hmm yes, he's giving
us 5 hanaka to decide.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.000
How long's a hanaka?

10:56.994 --> 10:58.995
Curiously enough it's exactly
the same as one Earth minute.

10:59.364 --> 11:02.365
Five hanaka? That only give us 28 hours!

11:03.554 --> 11:07.558
OK, let's get out our sheet
music and play the real waltz.

11:08.560 --> 11:12.095
Sir, they are a proud people
and will not change their minds

11:12.096 --> 11:16.558
unless you are prepared to stay here
and marry hackhackhack ach hachhachach.

11:18.560 --> 11:21.558
That's her name? I could
never settle down with anyone

11:21.559 --> 11:24.557
who's name sounds like a
footballer clearing his nose.

11:26.551 --> 11:30.148
The plan is obvious. *We* do the trade,
*you* go through with the wedding,

11:30.149 --> 11:33.554
when everybody is asleep we come
back and rescue you. What do you say?

11:33.589 --> 11:35.522
Not a chance in hell!

11:35.557 --> 11:40.553
Ana dok kaz, ana dok wah, hea.

11:41.551 --> 11:42.557
I do.

11:43.557 --> 11:46.056
Ana zun keh, zun keh atta.

11:46.091 --> 11:48.521
What's he saying?

11:48.556 --> 11:50.552
Erh, you may kiss the bride sir.

11:51.555 --> 11:52.550
What, without a bag?

12:07.411 --> 12:13.405
Don't be strangers guys. Seeya
*soon*. Drop in *any* time, any time.

12:15.408 --> 12:19.410
Hcanibey yech, onigon yech.

12:50.406 --> 12:56.404
Well darling, what a day I'm
pooped, straight to sleep for me.

13:00.408 --> 13:03.402
Nee bonnen nic parnin.

13:04.403 --> 13:07.402
Maybe in the morning, goodnight.

13:10.407 --> 13:12.404
You've been looking forward
to this, haven't you?

13:15.446 --> 13:17.153
Nack hey.

13:19.150 --> 13:22.035
OK, just give me a couple of
minutes. I want to slip into something

13:22.036 --> 13:24.156
a little more comfortable...
it's called Starbug.

13:28.150 --> 13:30.148
CHANGE OF PLAN LEG IT!

13:58.475 --> 13:59.474
Wait! Somethings coming.

14:00.477 --> 14:01.470
It's the emohawk!

14:02.471 --> 14:04.438
What happened? Where did it go?

14:04.473 --> 14:09.485
It must have transmuted into something else.
Suggest we proceed with extreme caution.

14:12.471 --> 14:17.750
It's somewhere close I can smell it.
IT'S THE STICK! AAGH! Oh, no it's not.

14:17.751 --> 14:22.474
Oh god, I'm so jumpy, I thought
it was the stick. IT *IS* THE STICK

14:28.496 --> 14:29.296
Where is it now?

14:29.491 --> 14:30.494
It's gone off into the undergrowth.

14:31.491 --> 14:34.129
Cat, you know what they're
like. Stay on the case.

14:34.130 --> 14:37.492
Don't pick anything up. Unbelievable
gettimg suckered like that.

14:38.506 --> 14:40.506
100 percent concentration at all times.

14:41.497 --> 14:42.498
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:52.512 --> 14:56.178
That's it: we're airtight.
Damn thing can't get in now.

14:56.179 --> 14:59.516
And all it took was a
little bit of concentration.

15:00.513 --> 15:02.947
How long before we can go?
We don't really want a visit

15:02.948 --> 15:05.511
from Listy's in-laws demanding
their wedding present back.

15:06.520 --> 15:09.418
It'll take an hour or so to get
the oxygeneration unit set up,

15:09.419 --> 15:10.844
but suggest we take off now sir

15:10.845 --> 15:13.511
and use emergency supplies
until the O G unit's on line.

15:14.515 --> 15:15.476
What if it doesn't work?

15:15.511 --> 15:17.513
Then Cat and Mr Lister
will choke to death.

15:18.516 --> 15:19.513
A plan with no drawbacks.

15:29.511 --> 15:30.510
Time we fitted that O G unit. Kryters!

15:33.512 --> 15:34.312
I'm on my way sir.

15:34.543 --> 15:39.544
That smell is still driving me crazy. I've
gotta wash my hands. Transfering to auto.

16:11.539 --> 16:13.544
It's stolen my cool,
it's taken all my style.

16:22.538 --> 16:24.039
I need a mirror.

16:29.540 --> 16:33.926
I got no grace, no elan, no poise.

16:36.427 --> 16:37.639
What's it turned me into?

16:40.541 --> 16:45.540
Duane Dibbley? DUANE DIBBLEY! AAAH!

16:46.537 --> 16:47.536
What is it? I heard noises.

16:48.538 --> 16:52.541
Look what it did to me, it's turned me
into Duane Dibbley, the Duke of Dork.

16:53.543 --> 16:55.501
Oh my god, where is it?

16:55.536 --> 16:58.542
I lost it, it came in here somewhere.

16:58.577 --> 16:59.499
Can you smell it?

16:59.534 --> 17:02.289
The only scent I'm getting
is extra strong spot cream

17:02.290 --> 17:04.532
and the dandruff shampoo
that doesn't work.

17:05.535 --> 17:09.726
It could be anywhere, it could
be anything. Trust nothing.

17:09.727 --> 17:11.645
It may have outsmarted you,

17:11.646 --> 17:17.540
but it's going to have to get up pretty
damn early in the AM to outsmart Arnie J.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.534
Is that a new gun? I don't
recall seeing it before.

17:21.876 --> 17:29.836
The gun, the emohawk's the
gun. God that was close.

17:29.871 --> 17:33.872
I hope you're right, 'cos if you're
not, we just flushed away our only gun.

17:35.875 --> 17:37.871
Just leave the thinking
to me, keyboard teeth.

17:40.799 --> 17:44.711
Lister, Kryten, the cat was right.
We had brought the emohawk on board,

17:44.712 --> 17:48.298
but lucky for you guys old iron
buck was around to sort it out...

17:48.299 --> 17:52.807
that's wierd, there's something wrong with
this microphone. It's not transmitting.

17:56.800 --> 17:57.800
Are you OK sir?

17:58.802 --> 18:02.805
It's removing my bitterness, taking my
negativity, slurping out all my snidieness.

18:15.798 --> 18:17.799
It's gone now sir, it's OK to come out.

18:21.797 --> 18:25.314
Looks like we both bought
a bite from the blighter.

18:26.215 --> 18:28.899
Let's track it down before
it harms Kryters or Dave.

18:29.900 --> 18:32.444
I'm afraid this means
death for both of us,

18:32.445 --> 18:35.797
but that's a small price to
pay to save our chummies, eh?

18:36.795 --> 18:42.476
What a guy. Listen, before we leave
I just gotta change these clothes.

18:42.477 --> 18:46.317
If I don't get into some
sideways ironed flares

18:46.318 --> 18:50.797
and transparent plastic
sandles, I swear I'll go crazy.

18:51.796 --> 18:54.795
Do what you have to old chum. I'll
go tell them we're having a party.

18:58.800 --> 18:59.764
What was that?

18:59.799 --> 19:00.794
The hydraulic lock sir, we're sealed in.

19:02.794 --> 19:03.800
It won't override.

19:05.794 --> 19:07.738
I've sealed you in
the engine room, Dave.

19:07.739 --> 19:10.794
Afraid me and the Cat have taken
a bit of a nip from the emohawk.

19:10.829 --> 19:11.761
You what? It's on board?

19:11.796 --> 19:13.627
It's taken my bitterness and Cat's cool.

19:13.628 --> 19:16.351
He's in a helluva shape, he's
looking so geeky he probably

19:16.352 --> 19:18.798
couldn't even get into a
science fiction convention.

19:19.798 --> 19:21.796
And the emohawk is still on the loose?

19:21.831 --> 19:23.759
We've got it pinned
down in the obs room.

19:23.794 --> 19:25.353
Well let us in, you need
all the help you can get.

19:25.388 --> 19:29.809
No-one I'd rather have with me in a fracas,
Dave, but you're the last human being alive,

19:29.810 --> 19:32.840
old love, and frankly you're
just too damn valuable to risk.

19:32.841 --> 19:35.572
Only one way to guarantee
victory for the home eleven:

19:35.573 --> 19:39.396
I'm going to open the airlock. Suck
the little perisher out into deep space.

19:39.431 --> 19:41.353
But sir, that would also
kill you and the Cat!

19:41.388 --> 19:45.790
He won't suffer, Kryters; I'll
snap his neck when he's not looking.

19:45.791 --> 19:49.351
Won't feel a thing. Believe
me, he'd want it this way.

19:49.386 --> 19:53.283
But sir, if we could capture the
creature we could extract the DNA strands

19:53.284 --> 19:56.349
and re-inject you both. Restore
your former personalities.

19:56.384 --> 20:01.221
Too risky Krytey. Anyway, I don't
think I could face becoming *him* again.

20:01.222 --> 20:06.380
Everyone has his limits. Fellas, smoke
me a kipper, I'll be back for breakfast.

20:09.378 --> 20:10.178
What a guy!

20:10.379 --> 20:13.083
But sir, we've got to
save them from themselves,

20:13.084 --> 20:15.015
their minds are totally distorted,

20:15.016 --> 20:18.381
the Cat's a complete yutz and
Mr Rimmer's... well... *nice*.

20:19.383 --> 20:22.381
Charge up the bazookoids.
We'll blast our way in.

20:28.377 --> 20:29.382
Ready old chum?

20:30.198 --> 20:37.197
Just let me check. Thermos, sandwiches, corn
plasters, telephone money, dandruff brush,

20:37.198 --> 20:41.453
animal footprint chart and
one triple thick condom,

20:43.054 --> 20:44.201
you never know!

20:46.199 --> 20:50.205
OK Duane, let's step into the airlock
and get part 2 of the plan underway.

20:51.201 --> 20:52.202
Oh, what plan is this?

20:53.199 --> 20:54.198
Just step in there, Duane.

20:58.197 --> 21:00.202
So, what precisely is the plan?

21:01.202 --> 21:05.200
I think you'll find it a little more
comfortable if you stand in front of me.

21:06.197 --> 21:07.201
Why are we in this airlock?

21:08.198 --> 21:10.199
Just relax old chum.
I'm sending you on ahead.

21:11.200 --> 21:12.196
*I'm* the scout party?

21:16.200 --> 21:18.496
Dave, you crazy fool. We're
all set to save your bacon,

21:18.497 --> 21:21.201
there's no need for you to sling
your love spuds on the barbeque.

21:22.197 --> 21:24.163
Sir, our best chance is to
tackle the emohawk together.

21:24.198 --> 21:26.311
Yeah, one squirt of liquid dillinium,

21:26.312 --> 21:30.195
it'll freeze it exactly where it
stands in whatever shape it's in.

21:30.230 --> 21:33.196
OK fellas, let's go.

21:37.199 --> 21:40.048
Looks like it's lasered it's
way back into the engine rooms.

21:40.049 --> 21:42.196
Probably looking for
you two gents, let's go.

21:53.196 --> 21:55.191
According to the psi scan it's
somewhere in this location.

21:56.196 --> 21:59.195
IT'S THE BARREL! Sorry, false alarm.

22:04.202 --> 22:08.199
That chain. IT'S MOVING! Sorry, sorry.

22:08.905 --> 22:11.437
Sir, try and remain
calm, you're experiencing

22:11.438 --> 22:13.528
a classic knee-jerk paranoid reaction

22:13.529 --> 22:15.777
to a terror situation, it's
essential at this time that we...

22:15.778 --> 22:16.514
IT'S THE WALL!

22:19.615 --> 22:21.606
Shame overload. I.. I... I, sorry.

22:22.909 --> 22:25.039
This is impossible, how
can we find something

22:25.040 --> 22:27.909
that can disguise itself as
anything? How can we lure it out?

22:28.909 --> 22:31.305
Worry ye not Davey boy,
it'll strike soon enough.

22:38.453 --> 22:40.579
Oops, I dropped my thermos.

22:42.380 --> 22:45.433
Eh, excuse me sirs.

22:45.434 --> 22:48.320
Gentlemen, I think we have a suspect.

22:50.121 --> 22:54.065
I got it! I got it!

22:55.866 --> 22:58.352
Oh, it turned into a
grenade, but I got it!

22:58.387 --> 22:59.348
Toss it away chum.

23:00.370 --> 23:02.349
I can't throw, I throw like a geek!

23:02.384 --> 23:03.349
Just chuck it.

23:07.346 --> 23:08.313
It's gonna blow.

23:08.348 --> 23:10.065
Leave this to me Davey boy.

23:11.766 --> 23:18.346
Smoke me a kipper, I'll
be... Freeze it Davey boy.

23:19.351 --> 23:22.350
But, sir how did you know it
wouldn't damage your hard light drive?

23:23.346 --> 23:25.351
Didn't Kryters, just
trying to protect you chaps.

23:26.350 --> 23:28.345
Well sir, better get you back to normal.

23:29.344 --> 23:32.208
Would it be possible for me to
stay like this for another 24 hours

23:32.209 --> 23:34.346
before I have to return
as *that* ghastly maggot?

23:35.350 --> 23:36.780
It's the least we can
do to thank you sir.

23:36.781 --> 23:38.344
And you, Cat, would you
like to stay as Duane?

23:39.060 --> 23:43.025
Suck my thermos! I hate
being the prince of dorkness,

23:43.526 --> 23:45.556
you never know when the next
clutzy thing's going to...

23:48.157 --> 23:50.058
Oop... What a Dibbley!
