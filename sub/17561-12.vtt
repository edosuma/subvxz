WEBVTT

00:02.168 --> 00:03.336
Hey, girls.

00:03.420 --> 00:05.422
I got it, it's amazing

00:05.505 --> 00:07.632
and it is right here
in my pants.

00:08.967 --> 00:10.093
Okay, Lauren,
if I show you this

00:10.176 --> 00:11.511
do you promise
not to tell Val?

00:11.594 --> 00:14.222
Absolutely.
You meet me in the back.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.100
Oh, it's just a ring.

00:17.183 --> 00:18.935
Wait. Wait.
Let me see it. Let me see it.

00:19.018 --> 00:21.187
Okay. Hey, how is that for Val's
birthday present?

00:21.271 --> 00:23.106
Oh, my God,
it's gorgeous.

00:23.189 --> 00:25.734
It's so much prettier than any
of her other wedding rings.

00:27.235 --> 00:30.572
- Hi, Val.
- Hey! Oh! Happy birthday!

00:30.655 --> 00:31.948
Um, okay, honey.

00:32.031 --> 00:34.033
I know you said that
I shouldn't ask you

00:34.117 --> 00:36.453
about our dinner tonight,
but just so I know what--

00:36.536 --> 00:39.289
Okay. Look, I'm sorry.
I'm not telling you anything.

00:39.372 --> 00:41.499
Okay, but I just need
to know what to wear, okay?

00:41.583 --> 00:43.126
So should it be
something dressy

00:43.209 --> 00:45.295
or does the restaurant
have a playground?

01:27.754 --> 01:29.297
Oh, ho. Thank you, baby.

01:29.380 --> 01:31.341
- Aww.
- I got to go to work.

01:31.424 --> 01:32.342
You're welcome.

01:32.425 --> 01:33.676
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
That's it?

01:33.760 --> 01:36.221
I sew a button on for you,
and that's all I get?

01:36.304 --> 01:38.306
Make out with me, dammit.

01:40.225 --> 01:42.477
Rick. Stop it.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.437
Oh, my God, you are so naughty

01:44.521 --> 01:47.524
and terrible and disgusting.

01:47.607 --> 01:50.568
Noon? Okay, I'll meet you there.

01:50.652 --> 01:54.405
Hey, Val, honey?
Pretty, pretty, birthday girl?

01:54.489 --> 01:56.533
- Yeah?
- Can I have the afternoon off?

01:56.616 --> 01:58.201
Oh, for what?

01:58.284 --> 02:00.995
Personal time, you know,
I'd rather not discuss.

02:01.079 --> 02:03.540
What are you talking about?
We tell each other everything.

02:03.623 --> 02:04.833
You're the one
who taught me that.

02:04.916 --> 02:06.501
You know,
you're the one who said

02:06.584 --> 02:08.961
"You can't keep things in.
It backs you up."

02:10.588 --> 02:13.591
Okay. Well, um,
It's about Rick.

02:14.801 --> 02:17.137
It's alright.
We can talk about Rick.

02:17.220 --> 02:19.305
You two obviously
have something special.

02:19.389 --> 02:22.183
Now he's separated, I'm not
gonna stand in your way.

02:22.267 --> 02:24.811
And, you know, this is
how okay I am with it.

02:24.894 --> 02:27.772
Why don't, next week,
you and Rick and Vic and I

02:27.856 --> 02:28.982
all go out for dinner?

02:29.065 --> 02:29.899
Oh. Okay.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.026
Well, we'd have to do it at 4:00

02:32.110 --> 02:34.904
and in a different state.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.739
- Why?
- Okay.

02:36.823 --> 02:40.910
Um, Val, do you remember that
horrible, horrible fight we had

02:40.994 --> 02:42.203
where you told me that Rick

02:42.287 --> 02:43.580
was never gonna leave
his wife for me?

02:43.663 --> 02:45.623
Yeah, I know.
I'm so sorry about that.

02:45.707 --> 02:48.501
- I was wrong.
- Yeah, not so much.

02:50.461 --> 02:53.840
- What?
- You weren't so much <i> wrong.</i>

02:55.216 --> 02:56.175
What are you talking about?

02:56.259 --> 02:57.218
Rick wrote you that note

02:57.302 --> 02:58.511
that said he left his wife.

02:58.595 --> 03:00.638
Yeah. Funny story.

03:00.722 --> 03:04.434
Um, it turns out
he didn't write the note.

03:04.517 --> 03:06.477
Somebody else did.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.938
- Who?
- Lauren.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.274
Who?

03:11.357 --> 03:12.942
Holly.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.113
Who?

03:17.196 --> 03:20.033
Me! Okay? Me.
I wrote the note.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.452
You what?

03:26.581 --> 03:28.166
- Come on, come on, come on!
- What?

03:28.249 --> 03:29.250
There's gonna be
a chick fight.

03:29.334 --> 03:31.502
Sweet!
Love you. Bye.

03:34.130 --> 03:35.715
W-why would you write the note?

03:35.798 --> 03:38.134
Because you really hurt
my feelings, okay?

03:38.217 --> 03:40.386
And I wanted to show you
how wrong you were.

03:40.470 --> 03:42.597
Okay, I don't understand.

03:42.680 --> 03:45.600
<i>I wrote the note!</i>

03:46.768 --> 03:48.728
Rick didn't write the note?

03:48.811 --> 03:51.314
Okay, how many times
do I have to say it?

03:51.397 --> 03:53.149
Rick did not leave his wife.

03:53.232 --> 03:55.234
I wrote the note
saying that he did.

03:55.318 --> 03:57.904
You wrote the note?

03:57.987 --> 04:00.073
Are you a blockhead?

04:01.699 --> 04:03.451
<i>I wrote the note!</i>

04:03.534 --> 04:06.412
Rick didn't leave his wife,
and I am seeing him later.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.998
- You're what?
- I'm seeing him later!

04:09.082 --> 04:11.668
Do you think
it's your hearing, maybe?

04:11.751 --> 04:14.295
You're gonna keep seeing him,
even though he's married?

04:14.379 --> 04:15.755
Oh, my God! Yes!

04:15.838 --> 04:18.091
And, please, don't try
to tell me that it's wrong

04:18.173 --> 04:19.841
because I already
know that it is.

04:19.926 --> 04:22.512
But it is too late, okay?
I am in love with him!

04:22.595 --> 04:24.555
Yeah? Well, you've got to get
out of love with him, woman!

04:24.639 --> 04:26.349
No, I cannot, okay?

04:26.432 --> 04:29.185
I have never felt
this way about anybody.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.937
Oh, my God, you lied.

04:31.020 --> 04:32.772
Well, when you're seeing someone
that you're not--

04:32.855 --> 04:35.024
To me!

04:35.108 --> 04:36.859
H-how could you
fake that note?

04:36.943 --> 04:39.570
What kind of sick, twisted,
manipulative mind

04:39.654 --> 04:41.114
would come up
with something like that?

04:41.197 --> 04:43.366
Do you know what happened
because of that note, Lauren?

04:43.449 --> 04:46.411
I came to find you, and then Vic
ended up in the hospital.

04:46.494 --> 04:50.456
And now Vic is on crutches
because of you. Because of you!

04:53.793 --> 04:55.461
[laughing]

04:57.422 --> 04:58.965
Uh-oh!

04:59.048 --> 05:01.509
Methinks me went too far!

05:02.552 --> 05:05.013
- What?
- Yeah, with this story.

05:05.096 --> 05:07.098
You know, I was just
trying to throw you off

05:07.181 --> 05:09.350
'cause of your
surprise party tonight.

05:10.476 --> 05:12.186
- What?
- 'Yes.'

05:12.270 --> 05:14.564
Okay, I made all this up
to throw you off.

05:14.647 --> 05:17.400
I don't need the afternoon off
to have sex with Rick.

05:17.483 --> 05:19.861
I need it to buy balloons.

05:21.320 --> 05:22.947
So you're not seeing Rick?

05:23.031 --> 05:25.408
No, oh-ho!

05:26.367 --> 05:27.368
You didn't write the note?

05:27.452 --> 05:29.996
Oh, what am I, sick?

05:30.872 --> 05:32.248
Oh, thank God!

05:32.331 --> 05:36.085
Oh! Huh! I thought my friend was
a horrible, horrible person.

05:36.169 --> 05:40.006
No, my only crime is that
I'm such a good actress.

05:40.089 --> 05:41.799
Yes, and I hope you are too.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.092
Because now that
I've blown it

05:43.176 --> 05:44.343
you're gonna have
to act surprised.

05:44.427 --> 05:46.346
Yes, 'cause I'm having
a surprise party.

05:46.429 --> 05:49.140
- Yes!
- Oh, my God, I had no idea.

05:49.223 --> 05:52.268
Yes. Okay, now that's the face
that you will use tonight.

05:52.351 --> 05:55.104
So, can I have
my personal time?

05:55.188 --> 05:57.565
Balloons, streamers?

05:57.648 --> 05:59.150
Yeah. Yeah, go, go.

05:59.233 --> 06:01.069
Okay, just remember.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.073
Okay.

06:05.156 --> 06:06.616
There is no surprise party.

06:06.699 --> 06:09.619
That liar is totally
going to be with Rick.

06:09.702 --> 06:12.246
Okay, Lauren is a genius.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.290
Did you see that? She turns
this whole thing around

06:14.373 --> 06:16.667
and pulls a surprise party
out of her ass.

06:16.751 --> 06:19.962
If only she'd pull some
morals out of her ass.

06:21.172 --> 06:23.883
Ooh. Ooh. There she is.
There she is.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.260
Okay, we are gonna have to get

06:26.344 --> 06:28.054
a surprise party
together by tonight.

06:28.137 --> 06:29.430
Yes, yes.
Here's some money.

06:29.514 --> 06:31.390
God, I just love you.

06:31.474 --> 06:35.269
Tina, shut up.
We are not helping her.

06:35.353 --> 06:37.438
- I am telling Val.
- No. No, no, wait.

06:37.522 --> 06:40.733
Holly, do you think I really
wanna be seeing a married man?

06:40.817 --> 06:43.152
- No.
- Then stop it.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.487
Then help me, okay?

06:44.570 --> 06:46.030
If we throw this party for Val

06:46.114 --> 06:49.117
then I won't be able to see Rick
tonight, which is perfect

06:49.200 --> 06:51.661
because he's going out of town
tomorrow for a month.

06:51.744 --> 06:55.414
A month, Holly. That gives me
all that time to get over him.

06:55.498 --> 06:58.459
Unless you wanna disappoint
your sister on her birthday.

06:58.543 --> 07:01.337
She did raise you.

07:01.420 --> 07:04.340
Okay, fine, I will help you
with the surprise party

07:04.423 --> 07:07.260
if you promise
not to see Rick tonight.

07:07.343 --> 07:09.554
Okay. Yes, I promise.

07:09.637 --> 07:10.930
Now you guys go get a pinata.

07:11.013 --> 07:12.557
I'll get some booze
and some deli platters

07:12.640 --> 07:14.350
and I'll meet you
here later, okay?

07:14.433 --> 07:16.978
Hm, would you believe I've
got my deli on speed dial?

07:19.272 --> 07:22.233
Hey, Rick? I'm on my way.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.698
[instrumental music]

07:30.950 --> 07:34.120
So, Gary, what are
you doing tonight?

07:35.580 --> 07:37.874
Uh, I thought I'd
watch the game.

07:39.584 --> 07:40.877
Right.

07:42.086 --> 07:44.130
Did you get into
the Pinot Grigio?

07:45.214 --> 07:47.383
You're not giving it up.
I love it.

07:49.010 --> 07:51.304
Hey, I thought you said Holly
already sewed that on for you.

07:51.387 --> 07:54.599
Aw, she did, but she's in such
a hurry to make out all the time

07:54.682 --> 07:57.310
her workmanship suffers.

07:57.393 --> 07:59.061
Well, look, with all
due respect, bro

07:59.145 --> 08:00.938
I think that suit
is getting a little tired.

08:01.022 --> 08:02.523
Maybe you should kick it in.

08:02.607 --> 08:03.733
You know how
expensive suits are?

08:03.816 --> 08:05.234
I mean, I'm lucky
I was an abnormally

08:05.318 --> 08:06.861
big kid in high school.

08:06.944 --> 08:08.905
Dude, if you need some clothes,
man, my boy, Dante

08:08.988 --> 08:11.032
he owns his own high-end
clothing line downtown.

08:11.115 --> 08:12.450
I'm sure he'll hook you up.

08:12.533 --> 08:13.993
He's always looking to get
his stuff out there.

08:14.076 --> 08:17.955
Well, does his stuff
cost more than...free?

08:18.039 --> 08:19.457
Dude, don't worry about it.

08:19.540 --> 08:21.792
I set him up last week
with two young-and-tenders.

08:21.876 --> 08:23.961
Man, he owes me.
Let's just say that.

08:24.712 --> 08:26.088
Thanks, bro.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.090
- Hey, dude, I have a question.
- Hmm?

08:28.174 --> 08:30.218
What are "Young antennas?"

08:31.636 --> 08:34.847
No, "Young-and-ten-ders."
"Young-and-tenders."

08:34.931 --> 08:36.265
What the hell is
a "Young antenna?"

08:36.349 --> 08:37.933
Why would I say "Young antenna?"
Crazy white boy.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.061
I don't get it. I don't know.

08:44.398 --> 08:46.275
Hm, let's get Val this one.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.777
You know what it looks like?

08:47.860 --> 08:49.946
It's a rocket ship,
you dirty bird.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.113
[giggles]

08:51.197 --> 08:52.740
You know what has
been bugging me?

08:52.823 --> 08:54.992
Lauren asked Val
for the afternoon off, right?

08:55.076 --> 08:56.285
But that was before
she came up

08:56.369 --> 08:58.120
with the surprise
birthday party idea.

08:58.204 --> 09:01.916
So I ask you, Tina, what did she
need the afternoon off for?

09:01.999 --> 09:05.044
- Do you think--
- That's exactly what I think!

09:05.127 --> 09:07.296
Oh! Lauren's the dirty bird!

09:09.215 --> 09:10.967
- Lauren?
- Yeah?

09:11.050 --> 09:13.010
- Are you with Rick?
- Yeah.

09:13.094 --> 09:16.138
- .Oh, God. Did you two..
- No.

09:16.222 --> 09:19.642
- Good, then don't.
- Yeah. Don't worry.

09:26.899 --> 09:29.318
[instrumental music]

09:29.402 --> 09:31.529
Oh, God. Oh, God! Oh, God!

09:31.612 --> 09:33.197
[knock on door]

09:34.532 --> 09:38.160
- Alright, where is he?
- He's gone.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.329
- Lauren, I know he's here.
- No, he's not here.

09:40.413 --> 09:44.417
- Okay, then, where is he?
- In the hospital.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.003
What? Why is
he in the hospital?

09:47.086 --> 09:49.839
I gave him a heart attack!

09:49.922 --> 09:51.507
Wait. What? He's dead?

09:51.591 --> 09:53.759
No. No, he's gonna be fine.

09:53.843 --> 09:55.845
It's just, he came over,
then we started to--

09:55.928 --> 09:58.681
Lauren, you promised me
you weren't gonna see him.

09:58.764 --> 10:02.977
No. I promised you I wasn't
going to see him tonight.

10:03.060 --> 10:06.897
And is it tonight?
No, it's today. Brava!

10:09.650 --> 10:11.068
Oh, my God, you guys,
it was so scary.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.070
One minute, he was
just looking at me

10:13.154 --> 10:15.364
and the next minute,
his eyes were wide..

10:15.448 --> 10:18.284
Oh, Lauren. Sweetie, calm down.

10:18.367 --> 10:19.869
It's gonna be okay.

10:19.952 --> 10:22.288
Okay. No, what are you doing?

10:22.371 --> 10:24.081
- Calling Val.
- No, no Val!

10:24.165 --> 10:27.626
I have to call Val. I mean,
this is big, and I'm only 19.

10:30.755 --> 10:32.882
[telephone rings]

10:34.675 --> 10:38.679
Hello. Holly?
Okay, slow down, honey.

10:38.763 --> 10:42.892
Ooh, Lauren's? Why ever would
I come over to Lauren's?

10:44.352 --> 10:48.606
A heart attack? Oh, dear,
that sounds so serious.

10:50.191 --> 10:52.860
Okay, I will come right over
and console Lauren.

10:52.943 --> 10:55.404
I'm on my way.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.781
You gotta get up right there

10:56.864 --> 10:59.033
early in the morning
to fool ol' Val.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.369
Okay.

11:01.452 --> 11:05.539
[gasps]
A sonic plaque remover
and a white jean jacket?

11:06.749 --> 11:09.085
Guys, I'm gonna cry.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.045
Yeah, that'll work.

11:15.299 --> 11:17.676
[knock on door]

11:17.760 --> 11:20.388
Huh! Oh, my gosh, you guys,
I had no idea.

11:21.931 --> 11:24.767
Oh, Val, thank God
you're here.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.602
Where's all the food
and-and the booze

11:26.685 --> 11:29.605
and the party people
popping out?

11:29.688 --> 11:32.108
Val, I know that you think
that this is a surprise party

11:32.191 --> 11:33.609
but it's really not.

11:33.692 --> 11:35.736
Rick had a heart attack.

11:37.321 --> 11:39.907
Okay, I get it. I come here,
and then you guys take me

11:39.990 --> 11:41.409
to the real place where
all the guests are.

11:41.492 --> 11:43.619
What, are you taking me
to the <i> hospital?</i>

11:44.578 --> 11:46.789
[crying]

11:46.872 --> 11:48.499
Wah, wah, wah, wah.

11:48.582 --> 11:49.917
[laughs]

11:50.000 --> 11:52.711
- Okay, I'll get a cab.
- No, Val.

11:52.795 --> 11:56.674
Rick was really here, and he
really had a heart attack.

11:56.757 --> 11:59.468
- But you're kidding, right?
- No.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.096
Listen, I called the hospital.
Rick is gonna be fine.

12:02.179 --> 12:06.434
But I'm...not so sure
about that one.

12:06.517 --> 12:08.894
[continues crying]

12:10.521 --> 12:12.398
Wait a minute, this morning
you told me that there was

12:12.481 --> 12:15.651
a surprise party and that
you weren't seeing Rick.

12:16.527 --> 12:18.404
Both untrue.

12:19.780 --> 12:21.699
She's seeing Rick,
and he's still married

12:21.782 --> 12:23.826
and she wrote the note.

12:23.909 --> 12:26.996
Yeah. See, when you got all
mad at her, she panicked

12:27.079 --> 12:29.081
and made up the surprise party.

12:29.165 --> 12:32.334
An evil genius.

12:32.418 --> 12:35.045
So it's not just Rick
who is a liar and a cheat.

12:35.129 --> 12:36.422
Oh, please, don't.

12:36.505 --> 12:38.883
Okay, can't you understand
the horrible guilt

12:38.966 --> 12:40.134
that I have been living with?

12:40.217 --> 12:41.594
And now I've got guilt

12:41.677 --> 12:43.095
about sending Rick
to the hospital

12:43.179 --> 12:44.180
with a heart attack.

12:44.263 --> 12:47.266
I could have killed him.

12:47.349 --> 12:49.185
You know what, I have
put up with a lot of crap

12:49.268 --> 12:51.395
in our relationship,
but this is the lowest thing

12:51.479 --> 12:52.771
you have ever done.

12:52.855 --> 12:55.649
I never wanna see you
or speak to you again.

12:58.444 --> 13:01.197
Nobody's gonna yell
surprise, Val.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.115
Then goodbye.

13:07.077 --> 13:08.829
[instrumental music]

13:09.955 --> 13:11.874
Yo, Vince. Come on, bro.

13:11.957 --> 13:14.293
Come on out. I wanna see
the new threads.

13:14.376 --> 13:17.588
Hey, did Dante come through
for you big-time or what?

13:20.841 --> 13:22.051
Yeah, yeah, man.

13:22.134 --> 13:25.888
Look at you, rocking
the sophisticated urban wear.

13:25.971 --> 13:27.306
Yeah, I'm just not sure that--

13:27.389 --> 13:29.475
Oh, you're not sure because
you're not wearing

13:29.558 --> 13:31.810
the <i> chapeau.</i>

13:31.894 --> 13:34.063
Bam!

13:34.146 --> 13:36.065
That's what I'm talking
about right there, man.

13:36.148 --> 13:37.525
Now you're styling.

13:37.608 --> 13:40.194
Look, Gary, uh, listen,
I-I cannot thank you enough.

13:40.277 --> 13:41.570
Hey, anything for you, bro.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.114
You're the best,
and I mean that.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.282
What, is it the color?

13:45.366 --> 13:46.450
Because you know if it is,
we can always

13:46.534 --> 13:49.370
exchange it
for the burnt sienna.

13:49.453 --> 13:51.747
Um, no. No, no,
the color's nice.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.749
It's just that,
you know, I

13:53.832 --> 13:57.336
I work with people
who have...eyes.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.632
What, a-are you saying
you don't like Dante's suit?

14:01.715 --> 14:04.885
I mean, I know, I know
that's not what you're saying.

14:04.969 --> 14:07.805
Well...yeah, that's kind
of what I'm saying.

14:07.888 --> 14:11.100
It's, uh, it's just
not my style.

14:11.183 --> 14:14.436
By your style,
do you mean no style?

14:14.520 --> 14:17.189
Come on, dude. You can't get
upset because I hate the suit.

14:17.273 --> 14:20.401
Oh, oh, oh! Oh!
So now you hate it?

14:20.484 --> 14:23.862
I see. I see. Oh, you hate
my choice of suit.

14:23.946 --> 14:26.532
You hate my style, my taste?

14:26.615 --> 14:30.452
You know what? Your hair
is so..."Footloose."

14:34.164 --> 14:37.418
You did not just drag
Kevin Bacon into this.

14:38.669 --> 14:39.878
Yes, I did, buddy

14:39.962 --> 14:41.463
and the gloves are
coming off, my friend!

14:41.547 --> 14:44.633
Oh, so is this ugly-ass suit!

14:44.717 --> 14:46.385
Well, you may
wanna reconsider

14:46.468 --> 14:49.013
being that it matches
your ugly ass.

14:50.889 --> 14:52.766
[instrumental music]

14:57.187 --> 14:58.814
Okay.

15:04.111 --> 15:06.238
And then she chokes and dies.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.283
[sighs]

15:12.077 --> 15:13.871
Hm. Okay.

15:16.915 --> 15:20.085
Stupid Lauren. Stupid Rick.
Stupid Rick's aorta.

15:22.296 --> 15:25.799
- Surprise.
- Oh, yeah. Whatever.

15:33.265 --> 15:35.351
- Mmm.
- Yeah. Sure, why not?

15:37.019 --> 15:38.812
You are never gonna guess
what Lauren did.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.522
- She--
- Worse!

15:40.606 --> 15:43.192
She wrote the note that said
Rick left his wife.

15:43.275 --> 15:45.277
Yeah, she started having
an affair with him and

15:45.361 --> 15:48.405
landed him in the hospital
with a heart attack.

15:48.489 --> 15:52.201
Uh, well...um, is Rick okay?

15:52.284 --> 15:54.870
Mmm. He's fine.
But she is dead to me.

15:56.580 --> 15:58.791
Val, you have to come
talk to Lauren.

15:58.874 --> 16:01.710
Hmm, let me think about it. No.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.962
Val, I know that you have
every reason in the world

16:04.046 --> 16:05.172
to be angry with her

16:05.255 --> 16:06.674
but she really needs you.

16:06.757 --> 16:08.258
She is in a bad way.

16:08.342 --> 16:09.927
No, Holly.
I am done, okay?

16:10.010 --> 16:12.388
I have put up with her. I have
taken her late-night calls.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.890
I held her hand. I have
no more energy for this.

16:14.973 --> 16:16.767
- But she's in pain.
- Mmm!

16:16.850 --> 16:19.269
So am I. I'm on empty.

16:19.353 --> 16:20.896
Yeah, I never wanna
see that girl again.

16:20.979 --> 16:22.856
[pounding on door]

16:22.940 --> 16:24.650
That's too bad.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.156
- Is she still mad?
- No.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.742
Get out of here!

16:33.826 --> 16:35.869
Oh, I meant yes.

16:35.953 --> 16:38.622
Let's give them some space.

16:38.706 --> 16:43.043
Okay, Val, I don't know why
I do such horrible things

16:43.127 --> 16:44.878
like lie to my best friend

16:44.962 --> 16:47.840
and give married men
heart attacks.

16:47.923 --> 16:50.926
You know, maybe
it's 'cause...I don't know.

16:51.009 --> 16:53.429
Maybe I'm just still
that fat little girl.

16:53.512 --> 16:55.889
Oh. Don't pull the fat card.

16:55.973 --> 16:58.600
This has nothing to do
with you being a fat kid.

16:58.684 --> 17:01.687
Okay, Val, I know that it is
hard for you to understand

17:01.770 --> 17:04.815
why I do such sick
and twisted things

17:04.897 --> 17:07.151
and it's because
you don't have to.

17:07.233 --> 17:11.155
You're all strong
and confident and perfect.

17:11.238 --> 17:14.157
Did you ever know
that you're my hero?

17:14.241 --> 17:17.161
- You're everything--
- Stop it, Lauren.

17:17.243 --> 17:18.162
No, I can't.

17:18.244 --> 17:19.371
And I'm not gonna

17:19.454 --> 17:21.415
till you tell me
you love me again.

17:21.498 --> 17:22.915
- Lauren--
- Oh, of course, you can't!

17:23.000 --> 17:25.461
How could you?
I'm a terrible person.

17:28.547 --> 17:31.592
Okay, you go now.

17:31.675 --> 17:34.052
Lauren, do you really
understand what you did?

17:34.136 --> 17:35.304
I mean, 'cause you keep
making jokes about it--

17:35.387 --> 17:36.472
No, I'm only making jokes

17:36.555 --> 17:39.391
to cover up the pain.

17:39.475 --> 17:42.644
I believed you.
I trusted you.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.772
- How am I ever gonna--
- No, please, okay? I just..

17:44.855 --> 17:46.523
I couldn't give it up.

17:46.607 --> 17:50.444
Rick made me feel beautiful
and charming and funny.

17:50.527 --> 17:54.448
He made me feel the way I bet
Vic makes you feel every day.

17:55.991 --> 17:58.827
- That is so sad.
- I know!

18:00.037 --> 18:03.415
You are beautiful
and charming and funny.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.834
And?

18:07.169 --> 18:08.295
Thin.

18:09.755 --> 18:13.425
Val, I swear, I am never
going to lie to you again.

18:14.676 --> 18:16.303
Was that a lie?

18:16.386 --> 18:19.348
Val, no one knows me
like you do.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.225
[instrumental music]

18:25.270 --> 18:26.688
I can't believe
Gary blew a fuse.

18:26.772 --> 18:27.856
I've told him a thousand times

18:27.940 --> 18:29.316
"You cannot run
the cappuccino maker

18:29.399 --> 18:31.610
and the X-Box
at the same time."

18:31.693 --> 18:32.611
Gary?

18:32.694 --> 18:34.029
(all)
Surprise!

18:34.112 --> 18:37.199
Oh, my God. Oh. I had no idea.

18:37.282 --> 18:38.450
And I mean it. I'm-I'm serious.

18:38.534 --> 18:41.703
I had no idea. This is
my real surprise face.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.997
Oh, my God, you really
were surprised.

18:44.081 --> 18:45.874
Oh, it's a good thing
you have a strong heart

18:45.958 --> 18:48.043
unlike you-know-who.

18:49.503 --> 18:51.588
You should totally
give her the ring now.

18:51.672 --> 18:53.382
No, no.
There's too many people.

18:53.465 --> 18:55.050
I wanna give it to her
when we're alone.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.385
I want it to be perfect.

18:56.468 --> 18:57.553
What's more perfect
than doing in front

18:57.636 --> 18:59.721
of all the people she loves..

18:59.805 --> 19:02.099
...and Tina?

19:02.182 --> 19:03.225
- Come on.
- Really?

19:03.308 --> 19:05.060
- Yes. Do it now.
- Okay.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.645
Uh, honey? Honey?
Sit down.

19:06.728 --> 19:08.605
I have a little something
I wanna give you.

19:08.689 --> 19:11.233
- He had teeth like a lion--'
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

19:11.316 --> 19:14.736
Vic has something he wants
to give Val, so shut your mouth!

19:14.820 --> 19:17.865
- Go ahead, Vic.
- Um, okay.

19:17.948 --> 19:19.825
As you all know, when Val
and I got married

19:19.908 --> 19:21.285
it was a little
spur-of-the-moment.

19:21.368 --> 19:23.912
And, uh.. Well, since then,
it-it's always seemed

19:23.996 --> 19:26.748
like our relationship
has been missing something.

19:26.832 --> 19:30.794
Uh, honey, I've been waiting
for the perfect moment

19:30.878 --> 19:33.714
to do this all day,
but the truth is..

19:33.797 --> 19:35.591
...any moment with you
is perfect.

19:35.674 --> 19:37.509
(all)
Aww!

19:39.219 --> 19:41.763
So, Val, I wanna ask you

19:41.847 --> 19:44.892
in front of all the people
that you love..

19:44.975 --> 19:46.310
...and Tina.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.271
[clears throat]

19:50.314 --> 19:51.690
Alright.

19:55.152 --> 19:57.112
Uh!

19:57.195 --> 20:00.741
Val, will you already
be married to me?

20:01.950 --> 20:05.662
- It's beautiful.
- Just like you.

20:05.746 --> 20:07.998
(all)
Aww!

20:08.916 --> 20:10.042
- Yes.
- Yes?

20:10.125 --> 20:12.211
I will already be
married to you.

20:13.086 --> 20:14.379
Oh.

20:19.843 --> 20:21.303
Pretty moving stuff.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.347
Yeah. Makes you think.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.975
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

20:29.561 --> 20:32.648
- Tina, hug me!
- I'm not really a huggy person.

20:32.731 --> 20:35.609
- You've hugged me before.
- Now, it feels forced.

20:35.692 --> 20:37.027
Just hug me!

20:43.408 --> 20:45.410
Come here, you.
