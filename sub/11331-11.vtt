00:00.018 --> 00:02.658
Previously on The Secret Life
of the American Teenager...

00:02.659 --> 00:05.850
So you two, you've never
had sex with each other?

00:05.851 --> 00:08.624
Well, we had sex before,
a couple of years ago,

00:08.923 --> 00:10.976
and it was great, but as it turned out,

00:10.977 --> 00:12.426
it wrecked our relationship.

00:12.427 --> 00:14.502
On camera. We are on camera.

00:14.707 --> 00:16.710
If our parents send us
to an all girl's school,

00:16.711 --> 00:18.099
I may never see Ben again.

00:18.100 --> 00:19.053
Or Henry.

00:19.054 --> 00:21.714
I'm afraid you'd only fall in love
with me because I'm pregnant.

00:21.715 --> 00:24.186
My mother is emailing and
texting and tweeting

00:24.187 --> 00:26.011
everyone in the country that I'm gay!

00:26.012 --> 00:27.255
We're going to a wedding.

00:27.256 --> 00:28.266
Your wedding?

00:28.267 --> 00:29.850
We should have done this years ago.

00:29.851 --> 00:32.049
I just got everything
I've ever wanted in life.

00:32.051 --> 00:34.110
That stupid couple told
her to break up with you.

00:34.111 --> 00:35.154
But, I'm not going back

00:35.155 --> 00:36.860
with her if she's going to listen to them.

00:37.722 --> 00:39.474
You really don't want to
go to school in New York

00:39.475 --> 00:41.370
like I know you always dreamed about?

00:41.371 --> 00:42.920
Dreams change.

00:43.082 --> 00:44.634
I want you to at least
want to get married to me

00:44.635 --> 00:47.516
before I officially give up my
apartment and move in here.

00:48.392 --> 00:52.389
I got an early acceptance into
Hudson University in New York.

00:56.587 --> 00:58.352
Start praying, Christian.

01:01.891 --> 01:03.168
Are you okay?

01:03.270 --> 01:05.178
Yeah, thanks for coming.

01:05.179 --> 01:07.194
So I woke up Grace and
asked her to come in here,

01:07.195 --> 01:09.066
and then I'll tell her about Jack

01:09.067 --> 01:10.861
and then I'll take her to the hospital.

01:11.181 --> 01:13.382
I know if I tell Tom he's
gonna want to come too.

01:13.383 --> 01:14.394
I don't know what to do.

01:14.395 --> 01:15.474
I think you ought to tell him.

01:15.475 --> 01:16.965
I can go with you and I can sit with him,

01:16.966 --> 01:18.426
but he's going to want to go.
That's his buddy.

01:18.427 --> 01:19.921
Yeah, but there's really nothing we can do.

01:19.922 --> 01:22.157
I mean, he's still in surgery,
he'll be in surgery for hours.

01:22.158 --> 01:24.256
What the hell happened? This guy
just came in and beat him up?

01:24.257 --> 01:25.446
No one heard anything going on?

01:25.447 --> 01:27.015
All those guys in that dorm
and no one heard anything?

01:27.016 --> 01:27.882
Oh, no, they heard.

01:27.883 --> 01:30.320
But by the time they got the
door open, Jack was unconscious,

01:30.321 --> 01:32.396
and the other guy just walked away.

01:32.397 --> 01:34.678
I guess Jack's teammates
rushed in to help him,

01:34.679 --> 01:36.234
but no one went after the guy.

01:36.235 --> 01:38.818
I would imagine no one would
want to after they saw Jack.

01:38.819 --> 01:40.312
It's unbelievable.

01:42.457 --> 01:44.083
What's George doing here?

01:45.069 --> 01:46.443
Oh, my God!

01:46.459 --> 01:48.330
You two idiots didn't get married, did you?

01:48.331 --> 01:49.770
No, honey, we didn't.

01:49.771 --> 01:52.866
George came over here because
Jack is in the hospital,

01:52.867 --> 01:54.779
and I think that we need to
go down there right away,

01:54.780 --> 01:56.154
and I needed some help with Tom.

01:56.155 --> 01:57.138
What? What happened to Jack?

01:57.139 --> 01:59.754
Someone beat him up, and he's badly hurt.
He's in surgery.

01:59.755 --> 02:01.705
His dad just called me
about 20 minutes ago.

02:01.706 --> 02:03.642
What? Who? Who would beat him up?

02:03.643 --> 02:04.577
The guy got away,

02:04.578 --> 02:06.775
but considering the
events of the past week,

02:06.776 --> 02:09.330
I would think it's probably the
pimp for that girl he helped.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.556
That's a dangerous guy.
Jack did the right thing.

02:11.557 --> 02:12.774
I got to believe he's gonna be okay.

02:12.775 --> 02:14.490
Mom, how seriously injured is he?

02:14.491 --> 02:16.271
He's not gonna die, is he?

02:16.272 --> 02:18.039
You said he's in surgery? He's in surgery?

02:18.040 --> 02:20.562
Yes, honey. And I don't know,
I don't have all the details.

02:20.563 --> 02:22.170
I know he has head injuries

02:22.171 --> 02:23.970
and some broken bones,
and that's all I know.

02:23.971 --> 02:25.053
Oh, my God!

02:25.365 --> 02:26.850
Oh, my God! He's not going to die, is he?

02:26.851 --> 02:28.789
No, he's not gonna die. I'm
sure he's not gonna die.

02:28.790 --> 02:29.826
It's all gonna be fine.

02:29.827 --> 02:31.162
But you're gonna be down
there when he wakes up,

02:31.163 --> 02:31.951
and his dad wants you there,

02:31.952 --> 02:33.555
so grab some clothes and
take off with your mom

02:33.556 --> 02:36.222
and I'll explain to Tom and
we'll meet you down there.

02:37.027 --> 02:39.546
Grace, go get dressed and
we'll go right away.

02:39.547 --> 02:41.091
His dad is there by himself,

02:41.092 --> 02:42.662
and his mom is at the condo in Arizona.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.025
She went to get the last of their things,

02:44.026 --> 02:44.926
and they're trying to reach her.

02:44.927 --> 02:46.351
So we should leave right away.

02:46.352 --> 02:48.592
Oh, my God. I feel sick. Oh, honey.

02:49.651 --> 02:52.122
Quiet. No talking.

02:52.123 --> 02:55.338
I don't want them to know
you spent the night.

02:55.339 --> 02:57.110
Why do I have to sneak out?

02:57.269 --> 03:00.299
You're a grown man. I'm a grown woman.

03:23.138 --> 03:24.903
So, anything you want for dinner?

03:25.411 --> 03:28.049
Mmm, anything that is fine with me.

03:28.050 --> 03:29.370
Why don't you just say what you want?

03:29.371 --> 03:30.755
Why don't you ever just say what you want?

03:30.756 --> 03:31.932
Why don't we just eat out tonight?

03:31.933 --> 03:33.471
Yeah. Why don't we get a babysitter

03:33.472 --> 03:34.610
and the two of us eat out

03:34.611 --> 03:36.824
and we can talk to happen next year

03:36.825 --> 03:37.825
when we're not married

03:37.826 --> 03:39.625
and you want to go out of state to school.

03:39.626 --> 03:41.535
Ricky, we're getting married.

03:41.958 --> 03:43.330
The plans are right there on the table.

03:43.331 --> 03:45.018
Doesn't mean that you'll
go through with the plans.

03:45.019 --> 03:46.259
I'll go through with the plans.

03:46.260 --> 03:47.849
Will you go through with the plans?

03:47.850 --> 03:49.596
You're the one who said
to run out, you know,

03:49.597 --> 03:50.658
when we were at the wedding chapel.

03:50.659 --> 03:52.797
Okay, well, we can talk
about that too, tonight.

03:52.798 --> 03:54.924
Okay, fine then, tonight.

03:54.925 --> 03:56.898
I'll call my dad and see
if he can come over.

03:56.899 --> 03:58.746
That way we don't have to rush back.

03:58.747 --> 04:00.813
We can take our time. It'll be like a date.

04:00.814 --> 04:01.699
Yeah.

04:01.700 --> 04:05.441
Well, I really have to go now.

04:05.638 --> 04:07.386
Goodbye. Bye.

04:08.227 --> 04:10.009
Did you want to kiss me? I don't know.

04:10.010 --> 04:11.394
Well, I want to kiss you.

04:11.395 --> 04:12.311
Maybe after dinner.

04:12.312 --> 04:14.818
Okay, fine, after dinner.

04:14.902 --> 04:15.762
Where's John?

04:15.763 --> 04:18.426
I told him to change.
He's wearing a costume.

04:18.427 --> 04:20.034
Oh, yeah, he wanted
to wear a costume today.

04:20.035 --> 04:22.218
Yeah, well, we can't necessarily always

04:22.219 --> 04:23.754
do what we want to do. Now can we?

04:23.755 --> 04:26.116
No, we definitely can't,

04:26.117 --> 04:28.434
but who cares what he wears to preschool?

04:28.435 --> 04:29.850
I care. Ricky, come on.

04:29.851 --> 04:31.122
He's three, it doesn't matter.

04:31.123 --> 04:32.992
Yeah it does, or do I have no say in that

04:32.993 --> 04:35.360
because he has your last
name and not my last name?

04:35.541 --> 04:37.225
Whoa! Since when is that bothering you?

04:37.226 --> 04:38.900
Since he started wearing costumes

04:38.901 --> 04:40.482
and you think I don't have any say in it.

04:40.483 --> 04:42.060
All kids like to wear costumes.

04:42.061 --> 04:45.153
It's John's way of expressing himself.
He's just being creative.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.602
He can be creative some other way.

04:46.603 --> 04:47.872
It's not a big deal

04:47.873 --> 04:50.883
and I refuse to make what
he wears so important.

04:50.884 --> 04:52.050
How do you think that's going to work,

04:52.051 --> 04:53.754
parenting John, with you in New York?

04:53.755 --> 04:56.562
You'll just go to school and
leave John here with me

04:56.563 --> 04:58.383
or are you thinking you'll take
him with you and leave me here?

04:58.384 --> 05:00.354
Ricky, I'm not going to school in New York.

05:00.355 --> 05:03.011
I told you, I applied there
before we even got engaged.

05:03.012 --> 05:04.578
I applied to schools locally too, you know.

05:04.579 --> 05:06.318
What I know is, your dream is to go to

05:06.319 --> 05:08.400
Hudson University in New York.

05:08.422 --> 05:10.707
If you go to school locally,

05:10.735 --> 05:12.022
then you're always going to resent me.

05:12.023 --> 05:14.494
Ricky, that's not true.

05:14.495 --> 05:17.499
Look, I just applied to a stupid school

05:17.500 --> 05:20.067
that I'm not going to go to,
to see if I could get in.

05:20.667 --> 05:22.836
I love you. We'll see.

05:28.596 --> 05:30.633
You know, if you're still hanging out
with nothing to do,

05:30.634 --> 05:32.718
I'm still available for mentoring.

05:33.451 --> 05:34.534
What are you doing here so early?

05:34.535 --> 05:36.278
I'm waiting for Amy Juergens.

05:36.279 --> 05:37.924
Amy Juergens-Underwood.

05:37.925 --> 05:38.939
That's the one.

05:38.940 --> 05:40.858
Even though she's married.

05:40.859 --> 05:42.044
Even though.

05:42.787 --> 05:44.682
So shoo, kid, shoo.

05:44.683 --> 05:47.776
I'll shoo when she gets here, alright?
Just give me till then.

05:49.817 --> 05:52.767
Talk to me, based on your experience.

05:52.768 --> 05:53.993
I don't feel like talking, okay?

05:53.994 --> 05:56.322
I prefer to until Amy gets here.

05:56.323 --> 05:57.775
What happened to Dylan? The redhead.

05:57.776 --> 05:59.576
We can't seem to stay out of trouble,

05:59.577 --> 06:01.224
our parents don't want
us to see each other,

06:01.225 --> 06:02.586
my best friend's in love with her.

06:02.587 --> 06:04.117
It's as hopeless as hopeless can get.

06:04.118 --> 06:05.621
More hopeless than Amy? Yes.

06:05.622 --> 06:06.975
How can that be?

06:07.658 --> 06:09.607
That's what you like, isn't it?

06:09.640 --> 06:10.794
Hopeless.

06:10.819 --> 06:13.962
I mean first Amy, then Adrian, then Dylan.

06:13.963 --> 06:15.362
All hopeless.

06:15.835 --> 06:18.159
I guess you're what they
call a hopeless romantic.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.360
Yeah, maybe I am.

06:19.361 --> 06:21.567
Only sometimes I hope it

06:21.568 --> 06:23.640
works out because there's reason to hope.

06:23.641 --> 06:24.905
Reasons like what?

06:25.657 --> 06:27.762
I just want something to hang on to, man.

06:27.763 --> 06:29.682
I just want a reason to
hope that I can make

06:29.683 --> 06:31.290
this relationship with Kathy work out.

06:31.291 --> 06:33.062
Okay, I give you my solemn promise

06:33.063 --> 06:35.391
to give you some of my
wisdom in the near future

06:35.392 --> 06:38.122
if you will leave right this minute.

06:40.963 --> 06:42.258
I'm working on it.

06:42.259 --> 06:44.006
Okay, I really have to get to school now.

06:44.007 --> 06:45.602
Go. I'll take care of John.

06:45.846 --> 06:47.490
He's still in his costume, isn't he?

06:47.491 --> 06:49.428
No, he's in his underwear now.

06:59.098 --> 07:01.094
So Ben is outside of school?

07:01.095 --> 07:03.709
Okay. Look, I don't know
how you know that...

07:03.710 --> 07:04.743
Ethan.

07:06.131 --> 07:09.594
Whatever. 
Ben is waiting for me outside of school

07:09.595 --> 07:12.509
because I'm going to tell him
that I do not appreciate

07:12.510 --> 07:15.702
him calling over here to knock it off.

07:15.703 --> 07:16.233
I'm married.

07:16.234 --> 07:17.475
Only you're not.

07:17.476 --> 07:20.706
Okay, fine. We're not. We're not married.

07:20.707 --> 07:22.622
But since people think we're married,

07:22.623 --> 07:25.078
you want to to knock it off?

07:25.243 --> 07:26.754
You weren't in the library.

07:26.755 --> 07:29.132
You were hanging out talking to Clementine

07:29.133 --> 07:31.249
because you were you got that letter

07:31.250 --> 07:33.113
and you needed to talk to someone.

07:33.139 --> 07:35.202
I know you. I know that's what you did.

07:35.203 --> 07:37.892
Ricky, why don't you try
going back to Dr. Fields

07:37.893 --> 07:40.262
instead of going to talk to someone

07:40.263 --> 07:41.982
who is a close personal friend

07:41.983 --> 07:44.180
who shouldn't know any of our business?

07:44.347 --> 07:48.019
Unless, of course, you're
interested in Clementine.

07:49.048 --> 07:50.394
And you lied to me.

07:50.395 --> 07:52.806
I know you and I know you lied.

07:53.344 --> 07:54.722
See you at dinner.

08:15.161 --> 08:19.499
Yo, it's me, babe, and I'll call you back.

08:29.543 --> 08:30.618
George's house.

08:30.619 --> 08:32.034
Nora? Ricky?

08:32.034 --> 08:33.441
Good morning. I was looking for George.

08:33.442 --> 08:34.328
Yeah, me too.

08:34.330 --> 08:36.950
He's probably over at Kathleen's,
I'll try to catch him later.

08:36.951 --> 08:39.287
No, I think he's here.

08:39.427 --> 08:41.794
Or maybe he and Kathleen are here.

08:41.794 --> 08:44.410
I heard them. I think I heard them anyway.

08:44.417 --> 08:45.431
Hi.

08:46.308 --> 08:48.387
What are you doing here? Who's there?
Are you okay?

08:48.388 --> 08:51.458
Yeah, I'm fine. Looks like we
had some sleepover company.

08:53.035 --> 08:55.026
What are you doing here? I slept over.

08:55.027 --> 08:56.875
What? You can't just sleep over

08:56.876 --> 08:59.176
without asking the owners of the
house if you can sleep over.

08:59.177 --> 09:00.973
Get a grip, Birdie, I slept over with Anne.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.372
What? No!

09:02.373 --> 09:04.983
No, you can't do that. You're my sponsor.

09:04.984 --> 09:06.453
I know I'm your sponsor.

09:06.454 --> 09:09.656
My sleeping over with Anne
doesn't violate any code.

09:09.657 --> 09:11.364
Yeah, it does.

09:11.365 --> 09:14.550
You know things, things I don't
care for her to know about.

09:14.551 --> 09:15.954
Like my nickname is Birdie.

09:15.955 --> 09:18.599
You know, we're not exactly
talking about you.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.753
So come on, be happy for me.
Be happy for Anne.

09:21.754 --> 09:24.291
We're in like, we were
up all night talking.

09:34.402 --> 09:35.675
Um... Ethan texted Ricky

09:35.676 --> 09:37.581
saying that you were waiting for
me and we got in a big fight,

09:37.582 --> 09:39.306
but I'm sure you don't care about that.

09:39.307 --> 09:40.948
Oh, but I do.

09:41.356 --> 09:44.994
Hey, look, um, I keep hoping
that we can be friends,

09:44.995 --> 09:46.665
but it's just becoming

09:46.666 --> 09:49.067
more and more apparent that we can't, so...

09:49.536 --> 09:52.284
I need you to stop calling
me and texting me

09:52.285 --> 09:54.825
and even thinking about me.

09:54.826 --> 09:56.728
And when you see me at
school, just ignore me.

09:56.729 --> 09:59.121
At this school or Hudson
University in New York?

09:59.122 --> 10:01.085
I can't go to Hudson
University in New York.

10:01.086 --> 10:02.034
You can if you want.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.810
I'm married, I have a son,

10:03.811 --> 10:05.250
and my husband goes to school here.

10:05.251 --> 10:06.959
What's best for you and your son?

10:06.969 --> 10:10.271
To go to school here or to live
out your dream in New York?

10:10.563 --> 10:12.440
Look, because if that's the case,

10:12.441 --> 10:15.159
then you should go to New
York and leave Ricky behind.

10:15.160 --> 10:17.681
And I'm only saying that because...

10:19.006 --> 10:22.002
Last night I was playing
around on the Internet.

10:22.003 --> 10:24.233
Couldn't sleep, and...

10:24.804 --> 10:27.577
Did you know that marriages
are public record?

10:28.219 --> 10:30.870
Yeah. You can just look
them up on the Internet.

10:30.871 --> 10:33.726
Anyone can do it. And I did it.

10:33.996 --> 10:35.838
And you know what I found out?

10:39.475 --> 10:40.783
You're not married.

10:40.784 --> 10:41.706
What?

10:41.707 --> 10:44.246
But don't worry, I won't tell anyone.

10:44.273 --> 10:45.666
I'll keep your little secret,

10:45.667 --> 10:48.391
but I know the truth.

10:48.907 --> 10:50.007
You're not married, are you?

10:50.008 --> 10:53.010
Yes. And I am married, okay?

10:53.011 --> 10:54.960
And we're going to have a second wedding,

10:54.961 --> 10:56.384
which you will be invited to.

10:56.385 --> 10:57.708
Have a second wedding.

10:57.892 --> 11:01.156
But just know that I'll be
at the back of the church,

11:01.157 --> 11:03.662
and if you decide to run,
I'll be waiting for you

11:03.790 --> 11:05.671
because you didn't have a first wedding.

11:06.489 --> 11:08.192
And that's all I wanted to say.

11:18.835 --> 11:21.694
Hey, Amy. I tried to call your
dad about babysitting tonight.

11:21.695 --> 11:23.994
I can't find him. How's your boyfriend?

11:23.995 --> 11:25.290
He knows. What?

11:25.291 --> 11:26.831
Ben. He knows. Knows what?

11:26.832 --> 11:28.980
That you got into Hudson
University in New York?

11:28.981 --> 11:30.123
I assumed that he knows that.

11:30.124 --> 11:32.873
Ricky, he knows that we're not married.

11:32.874 --> 11:34.688
No, he doesn't. Yes, he does.

11:34.689 --> 11:36.882
He looked it up on the Internet.
It's public record.

11:36.883 --> 11:38.686
And? And...

11:38.828 --> 11:40.619
He said he wouldn't say anything, but...

11:40.620 --> 11:42.282
But he won't. He won't say anything.

11:42.283 --> 11:43.585
Because if he does say something,

11:43.586 --> 11:45.227
he's going to answer to me.
I'll talk to him.

11:45.228 --> 11:46.739
We have to move up the wedding date.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.882
We're not doing anything just
because of Ben Boykewich.

11:48.883 --> 11:50.866
We'll have the wedding when
we want to have the wedding.

11:50.867 --> 11:52.685
Don't forget, your dad already knows

11:52.686 --> 11:55.667
so if everyone finds
out, everyone finds out.

11:56.539 --> 11:58.361
We shouldn't have lied to
everyone in the first place.

11:58.362 --> 12:00.254
You shouldn't have lied to
them in the first place.

12:00.255 --> 12:01.725
I have to go. Wait.

12:02.476 --> 12:04.466
Shouldn't we just go get
married this weekend?

12:04.467 --> 12:06.090
No. We shouldn't.

12:06.551 --> 12:08.175
Because I'm not so sure
you want to be married.

12:10.997 --> 12:12.302
Amy! Amy!

12:12.947 --> 12:15.401
Hi. Good morning.

12:16.082 --> 12:17.222
What's wrong? What's wrong?

12:17.223 --> 12:21.306
I got an early acceptance into
Hudson University in New York.

12:21.307 --> 12:22.168
That's great.

12:22.169 --> 12:23.731
No, it's not a good thing.

12:23.732 --> 12:25.640
Ricky is not happy about it,

12:26.087 --> 12:28.362
because Ben also got accepted into
Hudson University in New York.

12:28.363 --> 12:29.486
Why did he apply?

12:29.487 --> 12:31.048
I don't know, why did I apply?

12:31.049 --> 12:32.130
Because you wanted to have

12:32.131 --> 12:33.762
a reason to get away from Ricky and John?

12:33.763 --> 12:35.932
No. Of course not.

12:35.933 --> 12:36.906
You'd take them with you

12:36.907 --> 12:38.469
if you went out of state to school, right?

12:38.470 --> 12:39.923
Guys, I'm not going anywhere.

12:39.924 --> 12:42.005
I'm happily married and I have a son.

12:42.006 --> 12:43.626
So, like you said, why did you apply?

12:43.627 --> 12:45.198
Because it was my dream to go there

12:45.199 --> 12:47.508
before I ever got pregnant
or ever met Ricky,

12:47.509 --> 12:49.940
and I just did, okay?

12:52.530 --> 12:54.904
Now look who's finally telling the truth.

12:55.021 --> 12:57.301
Yeah, it's a truth that doesn't matter.

12:57.302 --> 13:00.266
There's no fairy tale
ending to being a teen mom.

13:00.267 --> 13:01.811
You can say that again.

13:07.985 --> 13:09.259
Waiting for me?

13:10.217 --> 13:11.383
Sorry.

13:11.691 --> 13:14.659
Really? I'm sorry, too.

13:15.241 --> 13:17.784
I've watched too many births on
the Internet since I met you.

13:17.785 --> 13:20.526
It's desensitized me.

13:20.899 --> 13:24.210
I'm sorry I said that horrible
thing about the birth

13:24.211 --> 13:26.194
and handing over the baby and all that.

13:26.814 --> 13:28.420
I'm just scared for you.

13:29.136 --> 13:32.294
I know. I'm scared for me too.

13:32.827 --> 13:35.926
A baby's head just looks so big.

13:36.379 --> 13:39.650
But I got to do it. I don't
have any other choice.

13:39.651 --> 13:42.025
Once the baby gets in
there, she has to get out.

13:43.051 --> 13:45.887
Who, by the way, is going to
be there, when she gets out?

13:46.153 --> 13:48.185
The parents, Jonathan and Sonya.

13:48.186 --> 13:50.394
They want to see their
daughter being born and...

13:50.395 --> 13:51.777
And what?

13:51.965 --> 13:53.994
And hopefully it won't be a long birth.

13:53.995 --> 13:55.411
Hopefully it'll be a very short birth.

13:55.412 --> 13:57.453
Hopefully they won't
make it to the hospital.

13:57.931 --> 13:59.420
Hopefully they do.

13:59.813 --> 14:01.521
I want them to be there.

14:01.755 --> 14:03.511
It should be a wonderful day,

14:03.572 --> 14:06.113
the most wonderful day of
Jonathan and Sonya's lives.

14:06.114 --> 14:08.652
To make it the most wonderful day

14:08.653 --> 14:10.122
I need to spend more time with them,

14:10.123 --> 14:12.599
get to know them better,
be comfortable with them,

14:13.091 --> 14:15.039
because they're going to be with me

14:15.040 --> 14:16.252
when I give birth to their daughter.

14:16.253 --> 14:17.466
With you? Yeah.

14:17.467 --> 14:19.194
Oh, uh... No.

14:19.195 --> 14:20.850
That guy is not gonna be there.

14:20.851 --> 14:23.077
And there aren't going to
be any videos or photos

14:23.505 --> 14:24.228
or anything like that for him
to post on the Internet.

14:24.229 --> 14:25.282
Jonathan and Sonya will

14:25.283 --> 14:27.364
want to take pictures as
soon as they hold her.

14:27.365 --> 14:29.778
I think they can wait until
then to take pictures.

14:29.779 --> 14:31.544
Yeah, well, who cares what they want?

14:31.723 --> 14:32.923
Uh, I do.

14:33.547 --> 14:36.869
And that's why I think that we
should just agree to be friends,

14:37.149 --> 14:38.611
because that's what they want.

14:38.612 --> 14:40.410
They don't want me to have
a boyfriend right now.

14:40.411 --> 14:43.868
But I am your boyfriend right
now, and I'll tell you something.

14:44.054 --> 14:47.082
I also hope to be your husband some day.

14:47.083 --> 14:49.741
That's sweet, that's really sweet.

14:49.963 --> 14:53.250
And a little crazy to decide
that in the ninth grade.

14:53.251 --> 14:56.343
Ethan, after the baby is born,

14:56.344 --> 14:58.781
I'm going to be going
back home to my family,

14:59.218 --> 15:00.616
I want to be home for Christmas.

15:00.617 --> 15:04.877
So, you should just go out
with Francine or Jody

15:04.878 --> 15:09.069
or whoever you want to go out with.
Get a real girlfriend.

15:09.159 --> 15:10.763
You deserve a real girlfriend.

15:10.764 --> 15:12.021
I thought we just apologized.

15:12.022 --> 15:13.866
I thought we were getting back together.

15:13.867 --> 15:17.626
Maybe after I have the baby and I go home.

15:17.755 --> 15:19.652
Maybe we can keep in touch.

15:20.245 --> 15:21.513
See you.

15:28.280 --> 15:29.802
Didn't want to interrupt.

15:30.139 --> 15:31.150
Maybe you should have.

15:31.151 --> 15:33.713
Okay, so what is it that you
really need my help with?

15:33.714 --> 15:35.610
There are 20 minutes before homeroom

15:35.611 --> 15:37.506
and I'm feeling slightly generous.

15:37.507 --> 15:39.100
Forget it. I don't need any help.

15:39.101 --> 15:41.440
It's over, all right? We broke up.

15:42.235 --> 15:44.430
She's going to have the
baby then go back to Texas.

15:44.431 --> 15:47.651
And I'm gonna go on with my life.

15:47.652 --> 15:49.011
Pleasure serving you.

16:04.627 --> 16:05.768
Oh. Hi, Ben.

16:06.331 --> 16:07.751
I was just leaving. Leaving?

16:07.752 --> 16:10.542
Yeah. You know Wendy is going
to this all-girls school

16:10.543 --> 16:13.596
and I just thought it would
be best if I joined her.

16:13.597 --> 16:14.825
We're all going to join her.

16:14.826 --> 16:15.762
But why?

16:15.763 --> 16:18.165
Why? Because...

16:19.741 --> 16:24.039
Ben, I know you and I made
some stupid, stupid mistakes,

16:24.040 --> 16:26.631
but I really did care about you.

16:26.632 --> 16:29.610
And I you. No, not really.

16:29.795 --> 16:33.839
You really cared about Adrian and Amy,

16:33.840 --> 16:36.688
but I don't think you
really cared about me.

16:36.689 --> 16:39.385
And frankly, I deserve better than that.

16:39.811 --> 16:42.337
I deserve someone like Henry.

16:42.338 --> 16:44.178
Like Henry, but not Henry?

16:44.179 --> 16:46.628
Well, he's so cute, and he's so nice.

16:46.629 --> 16:48.927
And if we'd met first, maybe
we would have hit it off

16:48.928 --> 16:52.386
but we didn't meet first, and I have to say

16:52.387 --> 16:55.133
I was quite smitten with
you, Ben Boykewich.

16:55.134 --> 16:58.581
We did have some fun and crazy times,

16:58.582 --> 17:01.096
but Henry is a very nice guy.

17:01.097 --> 17:01.813
I know that.

17:01.814 --> 17:04.578
And if you want to be with Henry,
then you should be with Henry.

17:04.579 --> 17:06.263
I don't want to be with Henry.

17:06.265 --> 17:07.988
I don't want to be with either of you.

17:07.989 --> 17:10.198
So where are you going? I'm transferring.

17:10.290 --> 17:11.580
And so are my friends.

17:11.582 --> 17:14.386
But isn't your old school going
to be finished in January?

17:14.387 --> 17:15.882
Are you going to transfer again?

17:15.883 --> 17:17.643
What are you going to do,
transfer every quarter?

17:17.644 --> 17:18.619
No.

17:18.931 --> 17:21.521
Wendy says the girls school
she's going to is great.

17:21.522 --> 17:23.895
She loves it, and we love Wendy.

17:23.896 --> 17:25.942
So that's where we're going,
to school with Wendy.

17:25.943 --> 17:27.301
But her dad was trying to get

17:27.303 --> 17:28.890
her away from you and
your friends, wasn't he?

17:28.891 --> 17:31.362
He was. But he can't.

17:31.363 --> 17:33.834
We're friends! We're best friends.

17:33.835 --> 17:35.724
And friends are more important
than anything else.

17:35.725 --> 17:39.330
So, sorry if I came between you and yours.

17:39.331 --> 17:43.142
A temporary conflict. And if you
want Henry, he's all yours.

17:43.143 --> 17:45.255
He's not yours to give away, Ben.

17:46.084 --> 17:47.386
I have to go.

17:51.979 --> 17:53.135
Bye.

17:54.748 --> 17:58.194
Bye, Alice. Bye, Henry. Bye, Ben.

17:58.576 --> 18:00.192
Have a nice life.

18:03.593 --> 18:04.901
What's going on?

18:04.902 --> 18:06.676
Dylan and her friends are transferring.

18:06.677 --> 18:07.770
In the middle of the year?

18:07.771 --> 18:09.154
Wait. It's not even the middle of the year,

18:09.155 --> 18:11.394
it's not even the end of the first quarter.
They're leaving?

18:11.395 --> 18:12.604
Apparently.

18:13.229 --> 18:15.413
Maybe you should go talk to her.

18:15.572 --> 18:16.722
Uh, maybe you should go talk to her.

18:16.723 --> 18:18.393
You don't want her now?
You don't want Dylan?

18:18.394 --> 18:19.469
Yeah, why is that?

18:19.470 --> 18:21.200
Wouldn't you like to know?

18:23.491 --> 18:24.921
We'll get it out of him.

18:28.003 --> 18:30.462
Hey, there.
You on your way to classes this morning?

18:30.463 --> 18:31.839
Yeah, I was just waiting till you got here.

18:31.840 --> 18:33.006
Your classes weren't canceled?

18:33.007 --> 18:34.836
Why would my classes be canceled?

18:34.837 --> 18:37.818
I don't know. Something hooker-related
going on at the school.

18:37.819 --> 18:39.603
Why would they cancel
classes because of hookers?

18:39.604 --> 18:41.234
Not hookers. Pimps.

18:41.235 --> 18:42.828
Some guy beat up a student.

18:42.829 --> 18:44.529
Not just beat him or her up,

18:44.530 --> 18:46.059
they're in critical condition.

18:46.060 --> 18:47.375
They weren't releasing names,

18:47.376 --> 18:49.876
but they did say that some
classes are canceled.

18:49.877 --> 18:51.833
So, if you want some extra hours...

18:51.834 --> 18:52.843
Who'd you say got beaten up?

18:52.844 --> 18:53.924
I didn't say.

18:54.061 --> 18:57.699
They're trying to reach a parent
before they put out a name,

18:57.700 --> 18:59.963
but I'm sure some of the
students know who it was.

19:00.431 --> 19:01.633
Surely word has gotten out on campus.

19:01.634 --> 19:03.840
I was making breakfast, I
didn't hear the whole story.

19:03.841 --> 19:06.016
I thought I'd get it down
here, but apparently not.

19:06.017 --> 19:07.053
They didn't say who got beaten up?

19:07.054 --> 19:08.876
Hello! For the third time,

19:08.877 --> 19:10.694
the kid's mother is out of town.

19:10.695 --> 19:13.505
They want to notify her
before they release a name.

19:13.506 --> 19:15.154
I'll let you know what I find out,

19:15.155 --> 19:17.493
and if I don't have classes,
I'll come right back.

19:17.494 --> 19:19.626
If you don't go to the library to study.

19:19.627 --> 19:22.179
I need to work, but yeah,
I also need to study,

19:22.180 --> 19:23.978
so I could do that, go to the library.

19:23.979 --> 19:26.606
You could, but you might
want to avoid the library

19:26.607 --> 19:29.445
if you're all high on caffeine,
if you know what I mean.

19:29.446 --> 19:30.519
Bye.

19:35.086 --> 19:36.330
He's a beautiful boy!

19:36.331 --> 19:37.699
Oh, thanks.

19:37.700 --> 19:40.174
He really doesn't look
anything like George.

19:40.302 --> 19:42.882
He doesn't really look like
either of you, does he?

19:42.883 --> 19:44.415
Did you ever have blonde hair?

19:44.416 --> 19:46.007
Not natural blonde.

19:46.338 --> 19:49.360
I think he looks more like me than
like George, don't you think?

19:49.626 --> 19:51.940
Yeah, from what I've seen
in the pictures at least.

19:51.941 --> 19:53.076
Were you ever married?

19:53.077 --> 19:55.202
To a man? Yeah.

19:55.264 --> 19:56.028
No.

19:56.029 --> 19:56.990
Stupid question?

19:56.991 --> 19:59.255
No, no questions are stupid.

19:59.480 --> 20:01.472
I had a really great time last night.

20:02.116 --> 20:03.758
Mmm, since we really didn't do anything,

20:03.759 --> 20:04.546
I'm guessing that we could

20:04.547 --> 20:06.707
probably have a better
time than last night.

20:07.571 --> 20:08.779
If you want to.

20:08.780 --> 20:10.025
Sure.

20:10.206 --> 20:12.354
Well, I should probably
get going, you know?

20:12.355 --> 20:15.203
I know. I got to get back to Palm Springs.

20:15.204 --> 20:16.927
It's not that far to Palm Springs.

20:16.928 --> 20:18.711
I'd like to take the drive
down there sometime.

20:18.712 --> 20:19.803
Any time.

20:20.369 --> 20:22.091
And thanks for sticking
around this morning.

20:22.092 --> 20:23.733
Well, thanks for letting me.

20:23.734 --> 20:25.679
Perfect timing, with
George out of the house.

20:25.680 --> 20:27.152
Yeah, I can't wait to meet him.

20:27.153 --> 20:30.155
Oh, I can. I can wait for you to meet him.

20:30.405 --> 20:32.325
Do you even want to meet him? Yeah.

20:32.659 --> 20:34.098
I'll give you a call, okay?

20:34.099 --> 20:35.179
Okay.

20:36.627 --> 20:37.774
Bye.

20:47.933 --> 20:49.259
It's going to be all right.

20:49.503 --> 20:51.106
I hope so,

20:52.159 --> 20:55.974
because on top of all this,
I have to fire Tammy.

20:56.005 --> 20:58.770
For what? Sleeping with me!

20:58.771 --> 20:59.812
Yeah, I don't know about that.

20:59.813 --> 21:00.810
You want to go grab some lunch?

21:00.811 --> 21:02.132
We can talk about Tammy,
get our minds off Jack.

21:02.133 --> 21:04.145
I am not hungry.

21:04.146 --> 21:05.336
All right, we'll wait.

21:06.319 --> 21:08.327
Say, how did Tammy get in the
house without anyone hearing her?

21:08.328 --> 21:12.154
She's living at her parents' house again.

21:12.449 --> 21:13.814
I walked down and got her.

21:13.815 --> 21:15.086
So her parents knew she was coming over?

21:15.087 --> 21:17.113
No, she snuck out.

21:17.114 --> 21:18.842
Sneaking out is never a good idea.

21:18.843 --> 21:20.333
If there's nothing wrong
with what you're doing,

21:20.334 --> 21:22.248
then there's no need to sneak around.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.487
So you left your house and
walked down there at what time?

21:24.488 --> 21:26.274
Midnight. Right after I left?

21:26.275 --> 21:27.785
Yeah. Well, personally,

21:27.786 --> 21:30.086
I think the two of you are old
enough to have a little sleepover

21:30.087 --> 21:31.216
if her parents don't object.

21:31.217 --> 21:33.495
Her parents? How about my mom?

21:33.496 --> 21:35.354
Hey, everyone needs a friend.

21:35.355 --> 21:36.835
You need a friend, your mom knows that.

21:36.836 --> 21:38.884
I need a wife.

21:38.885 --> 21:40.027
Me too.

21:51.350 --> 21:54.214
Hey, have you talked to anyone?
Does anyone know how he is?

21:54.215 --> 21:55.862
Who? How who is? What's going on?

21:55.863 --> 21:58.425
You haven't heard? Jack got beaten
within an inch of his life,

21:58.426 --> 22:00.373
probably by that pimp. It's Jack?

22:00.374 --> 22:02.324
Yeah, his mom's out of town,
they're trying to find her.

22:02.325 --> 22:04.062
His dad begged the police
not to release the name

22:04.063 --> 22:06.434
until he can let her know what's going on.

22:06.435 --> 22:07.446
Is he going to be all right?

22:07.447 --> 22:09.188
The guy beat him with a baseball bat.

22:09.189 --> 22:10.568
I think it's pretty bad.

22:11.084 --> 22:14.060
He's in surgery, head
injuries, broken bones.

22:14.061 --> 22:15.727
I don't know if he's going to be all right.

22:15.728 --> 22:18.488
Does Grace know? Has Amy seen her?

22:18.489 --> 22:19.289
Has anyone talked to her?

22:19.290 --> 22:21.726
I didn't find out until I
got to school this morning.

22:21.868 --> 22:23.675
Hey. Hi, Omar.

22:23.755 --> 22:26.095
No, Adrian, I don't know if
anyone has talked to Grace.

22:26.096 --> 22:28.823
Amy doesn't know or she didn't
when she left this morning.

22:29.066 --> 22:30.482
Bunny told me something was going on,

22:30.483 --> 22:32.400
but she didn't know it was Jack.
I didn't either.

22:32.401 --> 22:33.465
I tried to call Grace.

22:33.466 --> 22:36.811
I called the house, I called Tom.
No one is answering.

22:36.812 --> 22:38.643
I'll try George again,
maybe he's with them.

22:38.644 --> 22:40.829
He wasn't answering this morning either.

22:41.195 --> 22:41.931
What happened?

22:41.932 --> 22:42.948
The guy came to his room,

22:42.949 --> 22:44.945
locked the door behind
him and assaulted him.

22:44.946 --> 22:46.626
Was it the guy who was
in here the other night?

22:46.627 --> 22:47.490
Probably.

22:47.491 --> 22:49.026
And they haven't arrested
him, they haven't found him?

22:49.027 --> 22:50.983
No, he's probably out
of the country by now.

22:50.984 --> 22:52.309
That's what my dad said anyway.

22:52.310 --> 22:54.640
I hope not. I hope they find him.

22:54.678 --> 22:56.082
I'm not going to feel
comfortable until they do.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.539
Oh, no. Me neither.

22:59.337 --> 23:01.524
Well, do you want to come
over and stay with us,

23:01.580 --> 23:02.656
or stay at our apartment?

23:02.657 --> 23:04.987
Our? We're still talking.

23:05.840 --> 23:07.167
I'll be fine here.

23:14.410 --> 23:16.175
Really, Ben, you cannot say a word

23:16.176 --> 23:18.342
about what you think you
found out, all right?

23:18.439 --> 23:20.669
The power of suggestion
can be really strong,

23:20.670 --> 23:21.643
you know that,

23:21.644 --> 23:23.719
and if you start suggesting to people

23:23.720 --> 23:25.626
that Ricky and I aren't married...

23:25.627 --> 23:27.787
All right, it'll just be
between you and me and Ricky,

23:27.788 --> 23:29.861
just like things have always been.

23:30.722 --> 23:32.272
Well, it's time for things to change.

23:32.273 --> 23:35.455
I'll say. I completely understand
why you didn't get married.

23:35.456 --> 23:36.741
You've always thought you should,

23:36.742 --> 23:38.504
and you're going to because
you think you should,

23:38.505 --> 23:40.881
but deep down inside, you don't want to.

23:42.207 --> 23:45.395
Even if that were true, which it's not,

23:45.654 --> 23:47.410
I still wouldn't go back with you.

23:47.414 --> 23:48.554
I bet you would.

23:48.869 --> 23:50.259
But hey, no one's pushing you.

23:50.260 --> 23:52.676
We've got four years of
college to get through.

23:52.677 --> 23:54.119
There's plenty of time.

23:54.225 --> 23:55.782
Unless you screw it up.

23:55.995 --> 23:57.096
See you.

24:01.602 --> 24:04.747
Hey, Amy, I'm sorry about this
morning and about last night

24:04.748 --> 24:07.418
and about everything.
We really should talk.

24:07.419 --> 24:09.986
Why are you so nice all of a sudden?

24:09.987 --> 24:11.002
Aren't I always nice?

24:11.003 --> 24:13.855
No, and neither am I. What's going on?

24:13.856 --> 24:15.139
Amy, have you heard about Jack?

24:15.140 --> 24:17.376
What about Jack? Did he
save another hooker?

24:17.377 --> 24:18.901
If that's what he was doing the first time.

24:18.902 --> 24:20.249
Amy, he's in the hospital.

24:20.250 --> 24:23.010
He's a football player, I'm not surprised.
What happened?

24:23.011 --> 24:24.184
He got beat up by some pimp

24:24.185 --> 24:26.332
and it's bad. He's in critical condition.

24:26.333 --> 24:26.926
What?

24:26.927 --> 24:29.349
There aren't any classes
today, classes are canceled.

24:29.350 --> 24:30.951
They're still looking for the guy.

24:31.123 --> 24:31.734
They think it was the guy

24:31.735 --> 24:32.997
who was in the bookstore the other night,

24:32.998 --> 24:34.579
the one who scared Adrian and Clementine.

24:34.580 --> 24:37.038
Where are you? Are you with
Adrian and Clementine?

24:37.039 --> 24:38.427
I'm on my way home.

24:38.428 --> 24:40.387
Adrian's going to the
hospital and you should, too.

24:40.388 --> 24:41.798
I'll go with you. What about John?

24:41.799 --> 24:43.770
I'll pick him up at the nursery
and tell them you won't be in,

24:43.771 --> 24:45.128
and I'll take him over to my mother's.

24:45.129 --> 24:47.048
Just go home, Amy. Meet me at home

24:47.049 --> 24:48.997
and don't tell anyone there at school.

24:49.155 --> 24:50.269
They haven't found Jack's mom yet

24:50.270 --> 24:51.422
so she doesn't know

24:51.423 --> 24:53.440
and they're not releasing his name
to the press until they find her.

24:53.441 --> 24:56.244
I'll be right home, Amy, I'll
get there as soon as I can.

25:01.328 --> 25:02.492
You're sure you're okay in the dorm?

25:02.493 --> 25:04.851
Yeah, of course. It's just, um...

25:04.852 --> 25:07.025
I'll feel a lot better
when they find the guy

25:07.553 --> 25:09.492
and when they find out
Jack's gonna be okay.

25:17.942 --> 25:21.432
I guess we knew this was a risk, but now...

25:21.837 --> 25:24.622
Now it's the same risk.
Nothing has changed.

25:24.623 --> 25:27.690
We always knew that a guy like
this was capable of violence,

25:28.198 --> 25:30.947
and we're not gonna live our lives
in fear because of some punk.

25:31.722 --> 25:33.739
We offered to take this girl in.

25:34.319 --> 25:35.807
I say we stick to our promise,

25:35.808 --> 25:38.110
because we only promised
that we'll see how it goes.

25:38.111 --> 25:41.298
All right, well, I really want to do this.

25:41.751 --> 25:43.560
Unless you feel it's inviting
trouble into your home.

25:43.561 --> 25:44.765
It's our home now.

25:44.766 --> 25:47.011
And I want to help her and
you want to help her.

25:47.811 --> 25:51.084
But we both have to keep in
mind that it may not work out.

25:51.085 --> 25:52.311
Like Dr. Fields told us,

25:52.312 --> 25:57.582
taking an older kid into your
house doesn't always work out.

25:57.868 --> 26:01.882
Hell, having a kid from birth in
your house doesn't always work out.

26:01.883 --> 26:03.715
It seemed like such a
positive story, you know?

26:03.716 --> 26:05.739
I mean, this girl returning

26:05.740 --> 26:08.516
home to her family after
years on the streets.

26:08.711 --> 26:10.050
I can't believe she was abused at home

26:10.051 --> 26:11.373
before this guy ever grabbed her.

26:11.374 --> 26:13.846
Guess she had a reason
to want to leave home.

26:13.847 --> 26:14.816
Yeah.

26:15.967 --> 26:17.287
She's going to need a lot of love, Leo.

26:17.288 --> 26:19.642
I know, but we can't feel sorry for her.

26:19.643 --> 26:22.399
She's going to need a lot of
therapy and a lot of boundaries

26:22.656 --> 26:25.439
and strong parents to keep
her within those boundaries.

26:25.684 --> 26:27.222
Besides, it'll give us some practice

26:27.223 --> 26:30.211
in case the two of us decide
to have a kid of our own.

26:30.212 --> 26:33.140
Are you disappointed that we
didn't get more time together

26:33.141 --> 26:34.671
before we took on something like this?

26:34.672 --> 26:36.114
It's a big house.

26:37.270 --> 26:38.915
We'll have plenty of privacy.

26:39.242 --> 26:42.479
We can still get away and take little
vacations like we did last night.

26:42.480 --> 26:43.512
Yeah.

26:45.437 --> 26:48.399
Hi, Leo. Camille.

26:49.239 --> 26:51.777
Hello, Fairy Godfather.

26:52.658 --> 26:54.095
Fairy Godmother.

26:54.868 --> 26:58.929
Mr. And Mrs. Boykewich, I'm
Leo and this is Camille.

26:58.930 --> 27:00.546
And as it turns out,

27:00.547 --> 27:04.211
this isn't Ginger, or Ginger's
name isn't Ginger. It's Chloe.

27:04.212 --> 27:05.892
Yeah. If you don't mind,

27:05.921 --> 27:08.001
I'd like to ditch the street name

27:08.002 --> 27:09.371
and go with the name I used to have.

27:09.372 --> 27:11.584
Not a problem. Sit down, Chloe.

27:11.585 --> 27:14.371
I'm going to let the three
of you get acquainted,

27:14.372 --> 27:16.120
and I will be in touch,

27:16.121 --> 27:17.649
'cause I know you're going
to need me, all of you,

27:17.650 --> 27:19.974
and you can call me too, Chloe.

27:20.071 --> 27:21.133
Got to get back to work.

27:21.134 --> 27:22.889
Thanks, Margaret. Bye.

27:25.800 --> 27:29.021
So, it looks like you didn't
bring anything with you.

27:29.022 --> 27:30.384
You and I are gonna have
to go out this afternoon

27:30.385 --> 27:31.908
and get a few things, get you settled.

27:31.909 --> 27:34.096
Oh, I'm fine wearing
this seven days a week.

27:34.097 --> 27:38.019
Still, you're going to have school
and you're going to need things.

27:38.020 --> 27:40.251
Just remember the things are a privilege

27:40.255 --> 27:41.728
and privileges can be taken away.

27:41.729 --> 27:42.807
Got it.

27:44.039 --> 27:46.711
I just can't believe that you
guys are doing this for me.

27:47.438 --> 27:50.139
Okay, so first question.

27:50.654 --> 27:52.656
Why the hell would you take me in?

27:52.682 --> 27:55.014
And thank you,

27:55.804 --> 27:57.660
no matter what the reason is.

27:58.162 --> 27:59.253
Unless it's a bad reason.

27:59.254 --> 28:01.676
Oh, no, no, it's not for a bad reason.

28:02.539 --> 28:04.272
We have a mutual friend named Betty,

28:04.273 --> 28:08.211
and if somebody had reached out
to Betty when she was your age,

28:08.245 --> 28:09.895
then her life would have
been completely different.

28:09.896 --> 28:12.907
As it was, I reached out
to her in her forties.

28:13.840 --> 28:15.278
It's a long story.

28:16.118 --> 28:18.045
Let's get something to eat, Chloe.

28:18.046 --> 28:19.515
We'll tell you all about us

28:19.516 --> 28:21.145
and you could tell us all about you.

28:21.350 --> 28:22.418
Okay.

28:23.352 --> 28:24.502
I'll start.

28:25.471 --> 28:26.780
I know who you are.

28:27.518 --> 28:31.433
Margaret told me, and I just
want you to know I love meat.

28:31.982 --> 28:35.420
Everything from Spam to filet mignon.

28:35.421 --> 28:36.861
Then we'll get along great.

28:36.862 --> 28:40.475
Camille worked with me for over
20 years before we got married.

28:40.476 --> 28:42.217
When did you get married? Yesterday.

28:42.218 --> 28:45.639
We moved up the date because
social services told us about you,

28:45.839 --> 28:50.274
and, well, we would like
to have you in our family.

28:50.275 --> 28:52.017
Really? Really.

28:54.638 --> 28:58.336
Look, there was something
in the news this morning

28:58.979 --> 29:01.229
that Margaret thought we
should tell you about.

29:02.978 --> 29:04.206
Don't you want to sit down, honey?

29:04.207 --> 29:05.238
No.

29:07.078 --> 29:09.832
What could they be doing? Why
is the surgery taking so long?

29:09.963 --> 29:11.974
Hopefully, it won't be much longer.

29:12.503 --> 29:14.657
I wish Jack's dad would come back out.

29:14.658 --> 29:15.577
Why can't we wait with him?

29:15.578 --> 29:17.865
It's a small area, family only.

29:17.866 --> 29:19.379
He'll come out as soon
as he knows something.

29:19.380 --> 29:21.232
I wasn't nice last night.

29:22.059 --> 29:24.409
I wasn't nice the last
time I talked to him.

29:25.314 --> 29:27.583
And the same thing happened
with Dad, you know?

29:28.281 --> 29:30.264
The last conversation
we had was an argument

29:30.265 --> 29:32.480
and I've never forgiven myself for it.

29:32.974 --> 29:34.756
Even after I found out
what a louse Dad was,

29:34.757 --> 29:37.750
I still hate what I said to
him the last time I saw him.

29:39.228 --> 29:40.770
Of course, if I had known
what he was doing over there,

29:40.771 --> 29:42.101
I probably would have said worse things.

29:42.102 --> 29:45.275
Yeah, well, it is difficult
not to judge him,

29:46.369 --> 29:49.687
but we shouldn't judge
him, that's not our job.

29:49.688 --> 29:51.886
You just never know when the
last time you talk to someone

29:51.887 --> 29:54.116
is going to be the last
time you talk to someone.

29:54.117 --> 29:55.557
No. You don't.

30:04.798 --> 30:06.003
What are you doing home?

30:06.494 --> 30:08.147
Decided to come home for lunch.

30:08.148 --> 30:09.930
I didn't know you did that,
come home for lunch.

30:09.931 --> 30:11.872
Never did it before. We have to talk.

30:11.873 --> 30:13.892
I'm sorry. I don't kiss and tell.

30:13.893 --> 30:16.506
That's my sponsor. You can't date her.

30:16.507 --> 30:17.722
I thought you can't date her.

30:17.723 --> 30:19.143
I can date her, I'm not in AA.

30:19.144 --> 30:20.191
You know what?

30:20.550 --> 30:23.127
The longest relationship
she's been in is two months.

30:23.128 --> 30:25.629
Well, maybe I don't want a
long term relationship, okay?

30:25.630 --> 30:27.286
Really? Really.

30:27.287 --> 30:28.633
I don't believe you.

30:29.748 --> 30:32.106
I think you want to find someone

30:32.107 --> 30:34.167
to get married to, settle down with.

30:34.168 --> 30:37.034
This isn't about your having a
crush on Willowdine, is it?

30:37.035 --> 30:38.706
She's my sponsor!

30:38.707 --> 30:40.761
Okay, let me think about this.

30:41.798 --> 30:44.455
A lot has happened for
me in the last 24 hours,

30:44.456 --> 30:46.220
so I'm just going to drive home

30:46.221 --> 30:48.503
and I will call you, just like I always do.

30:49.494 --> 30:50.525
Okay.

30:51.437 --> 30:52.472
Do that.

30:55.747 --> 30:57.088
Drive safely.

30:59.432 --> 31:02.731
Are you sure he's not dead already?

31:02.799 --> 31:05.625
It's been hours and hours.

31:05.626 --> 31:07.148
I think the worst is over.

31:07.476 --> 31:09.980
I think they're setting bones now.
Poor guy.

31:09.981 --> 31:13.007
Let's go see Grandma.
Grandma wants to see you.

31:13.651 --> 31:16.251
Hey, David! George Juergens.

31:16.252 --> 31:19.845
Oh. Oh. Uh, yeah. George.

31:19.978 --> 31:21.270
Anne's husband.

31:21.689 --> 31:25.478
I'm just going to see my mom,
she's here in the hospital.

31:25.578 --> 31:26.966
And those two cuties,

31:28.426 --> 31:30.166
those are your sisters?

31:30.211 --> 31:33.934
Funny. How's your son?
You have a son, right?

31:33.935 --> 31:36.534
Right. Well, give Anne my best.

31:36.535 --> 31:37.871
I think you might have done that already.

31:37.872 --> 31:41.236
Uh, this is not really the place.

31:42.072 --> 31:43.159
I'll be in touch.

31:43.160 --> 31:45.920
That's okay, not looking
for you to be in touch.

31:46.136 --> 31:47.814
And by the way, Anne is gay.

31:47.815 --> 31:50.707
I got the email. From Mimsy.

31:50.809 --> 31:52.566
And I follow her on Twitter.

31:53.255 --> 31:54.482
Good to see you.

31:55.469 --> 31:59.227
Okay, guys, let's go find Grandma.
She's down this way.

32:02.477 --> 32:05.415
This is such a personal procedure.

32:05.962 --> 32:09.675
Are you sure that you want
me in the room with Kathy?

32:09.779 --> 32:11.204
I already said you could.

32:11.205 --> 32:14.050
You're going to be up here. At this end.
And no pictures.

32:14.051 --> 32:15.886
No. No, definitely not.

32:15.948 --> 32:18.342
And are you gonna want
your mom and dad there?

32:18.343 --> 32:19.715
I don't know about that.

32:19.917 --> 32:22.067
There's not a lot of room up at my head.

32:22.068 --> 32:22.862
And it's not like a spelling bee

32:22.863 --> 32:24.713
where they'll be proud
of my accomplishments,

32:24.714 --> 32:28.509
but I think they'd want to be close by,

32:29.174 --> 32:31.650
just in case anything goes wrong
or just to know that I'm okay.

32:31.651 --> 32:33.892
Then again, they did want me
out of the state of Texas.

32:33.893 --> 32:37.164
So, I don't know if they
want to be there or not.

32:37.165 --> 32:38.183
Whatever is good for you.

32:38.184 --> 32:41.611
I think it's time you started
coming to our young mothers group.

32:41.615 --> 32:44.288
It's teens who are pregnant,
some have already given birth.

32:44.289 --> 32:46.487
It's a terrific support group.

32:46.488 --> 32:47.988
And there are some girls in the group

32:47.989 --> 32:50.588
who have also decided to have
their babies be adopted.

32:50.589 --> 32:52.535
I don't know if I want to hear about it.

32:52.850 --> 32:54.605
I feel like it's kind of special.

32:54.789 --> 32:55.614
I don't know if I want to feel like

32:55.615 --> 32:57.014
I've joined some kind of weird club.

32:57.015 --> 32:59.466
If you ever want or need to talk,

32:59.467 --> 33:01.782
you know you can call
me at any time, right?

33:01.783 --> 33:05.311
And you can call me if you have a
question or if you're nervous.

33:05.312 --> 33:06.555
Just leave me a message,

33:06.556 --> 33:09.317
and I always return those calls
in the evening, after dinner.

33:09.318 --> 33:11.841
It's like everyone thinks I'm
going to freak out or something.

33:11.842 --> 33:12.836
I'm not.

33:12.837 --> 33:14.747
I want you to have this baby.

33:15.135 --> 33:16.616
I know you're going to be good parents.

33:16.617 --> 33:18.057
And I'm not going to try
to grab her and run.

33:18.058 --> 33:19.264
Just the same,

33:19.353 --> 33:22.306
it is a very emotional moment

33:22.307 --> 33:24.719
when the adoptive parents
walk out the door,

33:24.720 --> 33:28.071
and so whatever we can do to
help you prepare for that...

33:28.072 --> 33:30.129
Why don't we have a dry run?

33:33.350 --> 33:34.579
Here you go.

33:39.909 --> 33:41.568
She's not in a good mood.

33:42.021 --> 33:44.978
We asked hero break up with this
guy she's gotten involved with.

33:44.979 --> 33:47.481
I'm really not sold on being in the room.

33:47.850 --> 33:49.660
I'm not sure either of us
should be in the room.

33:49.661 --> 33:51.104
I'm going to be in the room,

33:51.988 --> 33:53.535
I'm going to be holding her hand,

33:53.536 --> 33:56.294
and I'm going to see our daughter
when she enters the world.

33:56.295 --> 33:58.800
Okay, I'm gonna wait till
she comes out of the tunnel

33:58.801 --> 34:00.688
and she's been through the car wash.

34:01.447 --> 34:02.979
Joking. Joking.

34:03.144 --> 34:04.717
I do that when I'm nervous.

34:04.718 --> 34:05.940
Yeah.

34:10.539 --> 34:11.592
Hi.

34:12.701 --> 34:13.895
Why are you here?

34:14.411 --> 34:16.085
I'm just walking around.

34:16.442 --> 34:18.154
Everyone else is downstairs,

34:18.155 --> 34:20.101
they're all waiting to see what's
going to happen with Jack.

34:20.103 --> 34:20.876
Who's Jack?

34:20.877 --> 34:22.724
You know that Christian girl you hate?

34:22.725 --> 34:25.237
Grace? I don't really hate her, but yeah?

34:25.237 --> 34:26.411
It's her boyfriend.

34:26.710 --> 34:28.484
Some pimp attacked him.

34:28.485 --> 34:30.476
Ew. He uses hookers?

34:30.476 --> 34:34.034
No, he was trying to help some
girl who was being trafficked.

34:34.199 --> 34:35.822
He did help her, actually.

34:35.822 --> 34:37.205
He helped her get back to her family.

34:37.206 --> 34:39.891
Oh. Well, that was nice of him.

34:40.199 --> 34:41.447
I hope he's okay.

34:42.944 --> 34:45.542
So you just wandered up
to the maternity ward?

34:45.543 --> 34:48.114
Well, it's a lot more fun
than most of the wards.

34:48.389 --> 34:50.210
You told Amy you had an appointment,

34:50.210 --> 34:52.667
she told Ricky, he told me.

34:53.882 --> 34:55.742
I came up here hoping to bump into you.

34:55.743 --> 34:58.175
You're making it difficult
to stay away from you.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.176
And I'm here with Jonathan and Sonya.

35:00.177 --> 35:01.524
Hey, I got an idea.

35:02.456 --> 35:04.535
Get in that wheelchair over
there and let's escape.

35:04.536 --> 35:06.752
Yeah, I'd like to escape from my life,

35:06.799 --> 35:08.317
but since I can't,

35:08.318 --> 35:10.222
I'm gonna have to try to
deal with it the best I can.

35:10.223 --> 35:13.289
You're so serious. Come on.
It's just a ride.

35:13.290 --> 35:14.714
Let's go for a ride.

35:25.273 --> 35:27.782
Hey! Be careful, all right?

35:28.617 --> 35:32.341
We'll get together again
and we'll talk, Ethan.

35:33.001 --> 35:35.429
Kathy, we'll just be waiting in
the car, whenever you're ready.

35:39.797 --> 35:41.222
I can't shake them.

35:44.939 --> 35:46.071
Or me.

35:54.541 --> 35:55.778
1***

35:56.428 --> 35:57.643
His name has been released.

35:57.644 --> 35:59.798
Yeah, his mom is in there now.

35:59.971 --> 36:02.785
They sold the condo and she was
there packing everything up.

36:03.102 --> 36:04.423
They turned the phone off already,

36:04.424 --> 36:06.181
and she hadn't charged her cell, so...

36:06.711 --> 36:07.912
His dad had to tell her on the phone

36:07.913 --> 36:09.569
and then she had to drive back by herself.

36:09.570 --> 36:10.458
How's she doing?

36:10.459 --> 36:13.279
I just saw her for a minute.
She didn't look good.

36:13.475 --> 36:14.946
Neither did his dad.

36:15.417 --> 36:16.671
I just wonder if there's
something they know

36:16.672 --> 36:17.746
that they're not telling us.

36:17.747 --> 36:19.553
It's weird, isn't it?

36:20.653 --> 36:23.467
We're really not good at being
friends until something goes wrong.

36:23.468 --> 36:25.447
Yeah, we need to learn
to be better friends.

36:26.499 --> 36:29.591
Thank you guys for coming. I'm so
glad you guys are here with me.

36:32.355 --> 36:35.708
So, the doctor let Jack's
parents go in with him.

36:35.709 --> 36:36.639
I don't know what's going on,

36:36.640 --> 36:39.730
but I guess they'll come out and
talk to us as soon as they can.

36:44.575 --> 36:46.585
I wish they'd find the guy who did this.

36:46.892 --> 36:47.881
They probably won't.

36:47.882 --> 36:51.111
Or they probably will. Be positive.

36:51.112 --> 36:54.078
They're going to find him and kill him!

37:00.249 --> 37:01.988
I need to talk to you.

37:02.472 --> 37:03.671
Don't like the wedding plans?

37:03.672 --> 37:05.918
I don't like the bride right now.

37:06.047 --> 37:09.312
I love her, but I don't think
she wants to get married again.

37:09.320 --> 37:10.921
Of course she does. She told me she did.

37:10.922 --> 37:11.842
She says she does,

37:11.843 --> 37:14.363
but if I said, "Let's leave
here and go get married again,"

37:14.364 --> 37:15.583
she wouldn't do it.

37:16.418 --> 37:18.155
I'm just telling you. She
got an early acceptance

37:18.156 --> 37:21.298
to Hudson University in New York
and I think she wants to go.

37:21.299 --> 37:23.164
I think she wants to be single.

37:23.165 --> 37:25.297
I think she wants to move
out and move to New York.

37:25.298 --> 37:26.310
I'll talk to her.

37:26.311 --> 37:28.401
I love her. You know I love her.

37:28.606 --> 37:30.225
But I don't want to marry someone again

37:30.226 --> 37:32.520
who's going to regret
getting married. Again.

37:34.686 --> 37:36.365
Hey, Betty.

37:36.400 --> 37:37.383
Oh, hey, Tom.

37:37.384 --> 37:39.350
Did you see the news?

37:39.351 --> 37:42.713
Did you know a pimp beat up my buddy, Jack?

37:42.714 --> 37:45.089
I saw the news earlier, but...

37:45.459 --> 37:47.539
But I didn't know that was Jack.

37:47.540 --> 37:49.764
They just said it was a student.

37:50.012 --> 37:51.100
That was Jack?

37:51.101 --> 37:52.614
Did you see that picture?

37:52.615 --> 37:55.877
The picture of that guy that beat up Jack?

37:55.878 --> 37:58.570
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he was pretty scary.

37:58.799 --> 38:00.069
But let me tell you something.

38:00.070 --> 38:03.033
All those guys are scary, all of them.

38:03.034 --> 38:04.395
Do you know him?

38:06.288 --> 38:07.886
Do you? Tom...

38:08.487 --> 38:11.061
If he were to find out that
I was looking for him,

38:11.575 --> 38:14.162
he'd do whatever he did to
Jack, he'd do it to me.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.701
I mean, I don't even know... Is Jack okay?

38:16.702 --> 38:18.382
'Cause I heard on the news

38:18.383 --> 38:20.553
that the student is in critical condition.

38:20.554 --> 38:23.167
Yeah, that's right. He could die.

38:23.170 --> 38:27.594
Please try to find this guy.

38:27.595 --> 38:29.361
Find out where he is.

38:29.362 --> 38:31.748
No. No, I can't, Tom.

38:31.749 --> 38:35.616
Yes, you can! I'm not
afraid to go to the police.

38:35.617 --> 38:38.871
The police will get this guy!

38:38.872 --> 38:42.204
Find out where he is!

38:48.567 --> 38:51.197
Hey, we just heard on the news. How is he?

38:51.198 --> 38:53.178
He's not good. We need to talk.

38:53.179 --> 38:54.194
We can talk later.

38:54.195 --> 38:56.823
There's nothing new. He's
in critical condition.

38:57.003 --> 38:57.903
His mom just got here

38:57.904 --> 38:59.920
and we're hoping to find out
something any minute now.

38:59.921 --> 39:02.578
I want to talk to you. Why
don't we go sit down?

39:19.132 --> 39:20.831
Whether or not Amy and I are married

39:20.832 --> 39:23.249
or whether or not we have a
wedding or a second wedding,

39:23.250 --> 39:24.298
that's none of your business.

39:24.299 --> 39:26.165
I actually think it's everyone's business

39:26.166 --> 39:29.325
after that big welcome back
to school after you eloped.

39:29.326 --> 39:30.208
Or not.

39:30.209 --> 39:31.699
Now, listen to me. Stay out of it, Ben.

39:31.700 --> 39:33.693
And don't tell me you just can't,

39:33.726 --> 39:36.181
because I have a son with Amy.
And that hasn't changed.

39:36.182 --> 39:38.478
Nothing is ever gonna change that.

39:43.944 --> 39:45.122
Ben's here.

39:45.462 --> 39:46.389
Yeah, I saw.

39:46.390 --> 39:47.890
Yeah, I... I don't really
want to talk to him.

39:47.891 --> 39:48.940
Are you okay?

39:49.966 --> 39:51.049
Yeah.

39:52.090 --> 39:52.595
Yeah...

39:52.596 --> 39:54.557
Last time you were at this hospital,

39:54.872 --> 39:57.082
you were giving birth
to Mercy, weren't you?

39:57.083 --> 39:58.135
Yeah.

39:59.408 --> 40:01.436
I don't really like hospitals much.

40:04.142 --> 40:08.671
Why don't we, uh, say goodnight
to Grace and go home?

40:08.672 --> 40:11.316
All right, we could do that.
We can go home, if you want.

40:12.472 --> 40:13.656
Do you want to have children?

40:13.657 --> 40:14.626
Me?

40:15.110 --> 40:17.147
Sure. You?

40:17.282 --> 40:18.350
Yeah.

40:18.758 --> 40:20.756
Yeah, I want to try to have a baby again,

40:21.402 --> 40:24.560
or two. I want to adopt children too.

40:24.561 --> 40:26.460
I want a lot of children.

40:27.400 --> 40:29.687
That's a bigger commitment
than getting married.

40:31.001 --> 40:32.191
Yeah, I guess.

40:32.406 --> 40:34.606
Let's do things in the right order.

40:34.607 --> 40:35.917
What's the right order?

40:50.967 --> 40:52.195
Could you, um...

40:53.142 --> 40:55.876
Could you make the stone
just a little bit bigger?

41:03.233 --> 41:04.374
Are you okay?

41:05.328 --> 41:07.452
Yeah. I'm okay.

41:07.453 --> 41:11.329
I just, um, forgot the
last time I was here.

41:12.938 --> 41:16.968
Ugh. My dad keeps bugging me.
He and Camille are home,

41:17.482 --> 41:19.162
they want to show me some big surprise.

41:19.163 --> 41:20.794
Is she pregnant?

41:23.427 --> 41:24.764
You should call your mother,

41:24.765 --> 41:26.392
ask if it's okay if we're still here.

41:26.393 --> 41:28.027
John may be getting cranky by now.

41:28.028 --> 41:29.648
My mom can handle any kid.

41:29.649 --> 41:31.824
I don't think she'll have a
problem with her own grandson.

41:32.387 --> 41:35.605
I do want to get married, I really do.

41:36.607 --> 41:38.113
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.

41:38.114 --> 41:40.563
Or you're just feeling sensitive

41:40.564 --> 41:42.907
because we're waiting to hear
what's going on with Jack.

41:45.200 --> 41:46.831
If his parents come out here

41:47.398 --> 41:51.082
and say that he's going to be
fine, he'll recover fully,

41:51.168 --> 41:54.113
then my guess is we're both
going to go right back

41:54.114 --> 41:55.682
to where we were this morning.

41:56.760 --> 42:00.388
On the other hand, if they say
he's not going to make it,

42:00.389 --> 42:02.208
then maybe each of us will learn that

42:02.209 --> 42:04.197
sometimes there's not another chance.

42:04.198 --> 42:06.460
Sometimes that's just it.

42:22.163 --> 42:23.487
Shall we pray?

42:23.512 --> 42:33.512
