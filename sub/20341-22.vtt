01:14.208 --> 01:17.875

01:32.375 --> 01:37.416
Oh, no!
The drag race has become
a spilly mess race.

01:37.416 --> 01:39.708
It's not that spilly messy.

01:41.166 --> 01:45.291
Hmm. I guess it's spillier
and messier than I thought.

01:45.291 --> 01:46.750

01:54.208 --> 01:56.333
Whoa!
What happened?

01:56.333 --> 02:00.000

jungle in here!

02:00.000 --> 02:02.833
-We're sorry, Bob.
-We had a drag race, but...

02:02.833 --> 02:04.375

02:04.375 --> 02:06.125
Hissy! Oh, look at you!

02:06.125 --> 02:08.833
-(Hissy groans)
-You know, you need
some time out of the house,

02:08.833 --> 02:11.375
so you won't be part
of any more messes like this.

02:11.375 --> 02:13.958
I'm gonna take
this frazzled feline

02:13.958 --> 02:16.458
to Meowland
on my way to work.

02:16.458 --> 02:20.208
I think a day there is
exactly what she needs.

02:20.208 --> 02:21.416
Wha?

02:21.416 --> 02:23.958
Did Bob say he was giving
Hissy a time-out?

02:23.958 --> 02:26.000
Yeah,
for the whole day.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.708
Time-outs are for when
you do something you're
not supposed to do,

02:28.708 --> 02:30.083
and she didn't do any of this.

02:30.083 --> 02:31.708
But Bob thought she did,

02:31.708 --> 02:34.125
which means it's gonna be
our mission to get Hissy

02:34.125 --> 02:36.583
out of that Meowland place
and bring her back home.

02:36.583 --> 02:38.500
Bingo and Rolly to the rescue!

02:38.500 --> 02:40.166
Yeah!

02:40.166 --> 02:42.458
And when we get back,
we can help ARF
clean this place up.

02:42.458 --> 02:45.375
But ARF has
already cleaned up.

02:45.375 --> 02:49.333
ARF dragged everything back
to where it was and won

Mm, does that feel good,
Miss Hissy?

04:00.458 --> 04:01.458

04:01.458 --> 04:04.083

04:06.583 --> 04:09.833
I do feel extra special.

04:09.833 --> 04:12.000
Oh, yeah.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.500
I'm sorry, Meowland
is only for cats.

04:15.500 --> 04:18.458
Well, our pet sometimes
thinks he's a cat.

04:18.458 --> 04:21.083
He even purrs
when I scratch
his tum-tum.

04:21.083 --> 04:22.708
-(purring)
-(Rolly grunts)

04:22.708 --> 04:25.458
(Bingo chuckles)

04:25.458 --> 04:27.416
But your pet is an iguana,

04:27.416 --> 04:31.083
and the only animals
we allow inside
this building are cats.

04:31.083 --> 04:32.416
What are we gonna do?

04:32.416 --> 04:35.083
The only way to get inside
is if we're cats.

04:35.083 --> 04:37.125
Or if we look
like cats.

04:37.125 --> 04:39.583
Remember when we were doing
crafts with Bob?

04:39.583 --> 04:41.958
He left some fuzzy sticks
in our collars.

04:41.958 --> 04:44.208
The twisty-wisty-twirly ones!

04:44.208 --> 04:47.500
These are gonna be our whiskers,
and you and I are gonna be cats.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.583
And they'll let us
walk right in.

04:49.583 --> 04:54.375
Now, do you know any place
that might be right
for our pet, Iggy?

04:54.375 --> 04:56.458
Some place that'll
scratch him on his tummy?

04:56.458 --> 04:59.708
'Cause he loves gettin'
his tummy scratched
almost as much as I do.

04:59.708 --> 05:02.125
-(Frank chuckles)
-Esther: Oh, Frank!

05:02.125 --> 05:04.000
-Is it working?
-Yeah.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.125
Because we look
just like cats.

05:06.125 --> 05:07.833
Do we have
to say meow?

05:07.833 --> 05:11.125
Bingo: No need.
We've got everyone fooled.

05:12.458 --> 05:14.250
We're in! Phew!

05:14.250 --> 05:16.375
Now we can go back
to looking like puppies.

05:16.375 --> 05:19.583
Aw, already? But I was just
getting good at being a cat.

05:21.333 --> 05:22.958
I can see why cats
like doing this.

05:22.958 --> 05:25.208
They get to rub
their faces with spit.

05:25.208 --> 05:27.000
Come on.
We need to find Hissy.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.583
Hissy could be anywhere
in this place.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.625
What do you think
happens in this room?

05:34.625 --> 05:35.625
I don't know.

05:35.625 --> 05:38.083
Maybe they make the cats
who are being punished

05:38.083 --> 05:40.083
sit around
not have any fun.

05:40.083 --> 05:41.583
You think Hissy's
somewhere in here?

05:41.583 --> 05:43.250
She might be.

05:43.250 --> 05:45.875
You look over there,
and I'll look around
a bit higher.

05:50.625 --> 05:52.458
Whoa, this is all swingy!

05:52.458 --> 05:54.708
Ooh, and now
it's even swingier!

-Whee! (grunts)
-(thuds)

05:59.083 --> 06:02.583
-Are you okay?
-I think so, but they really
need to fix that bridge.

06:02.583 --> 06:04.708
Let's keep looking
around this place.

06:04.708 --> 06:06.875
I don't know where Hissy is
or what they're doing to her,

06:06.875 --> 06:09.958
but she probably
wants to get out of here fast!

06:09.958 --> 06:12.375

06:12.375 --> 06:15.458
Who's a happy kitty?
Is it you?

06:15.458 --> 06:17.208
Is it you?

06:17.208 --> 06:19.250
Yes, it's me.

06:19.250 --> 06:21.583
It's so me.

06:21.583 --> 06:24.375
Do you think
Hissy might be inside
one of those kitty rooms?

06:24.375 --> 06:26.333
Hmm. There's only one way
to find out.

06:26.333 --> 06:28.500
Knock 'em over and rip
the rooms apart with our teeth?

06:28.500 --> 06:30.875
(gasps) Oh!
I really wanna do that!

06:30.875 --> 06:33.708
Look inside each of them
and see if Hissy's in there.

06:33.708 --> 06:36.250
So there's actually
two ways, but...

09:46.458 --> 09:48.250
If cats could talk,
I'm sure she'd say,

09:48.250 --> 09:51.208
"I never wanna
leave here, never."

09:51.208 --> 09:53.000
-We did it!
-We're free!

09:53.000 --> 09:54.750
-(grunts)
-Whoa!

09:54.750 --> 09:58.333
(soothing instrumental
music playing)

09:58.333 --> 09:59.875
-(record scratches)
-Whoa!

09:59.875 --> 10:01.208
-Whoops.
-Hissy!

10:01.208 --> 10:03.708
Are you okay?

10:03.708 --> 10:06.500
What is going on?

10:06.500 --> 10:08.000
We're here to rescue you!

10:08.000 --> 10:10.458
We felt bad that Bob
got mad at you

10:10.458 --> 10:13.875
and gave you a time-out
for the toilet paper mess
that was our fault.

10:13.875 --> 10:18.000
No! Bob didn't send me here
'cause he was mad at me.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
He sent me here to get clean,

10:20.000 --> 10:21.833
and also, to get brushed,

10:21.833 --> 10:26.125
and also, to get cuddled up
in towels and listen
to pretty music.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.333
(groans)

10:27.333 --> 10:29.375
Wow, that sounds like
a pretty good day.

10:29.375 --> 10:31.875
It was the best day ever.

10:31.875 --> 10:35.291
(groans) And I wish
it didn't have to end.

10:35.291 --> 10:38.208
Oh, no!
What happened?

10:38.208 --> 10:39.708
(meows)

10:39.708 --> 10:42.375
You can't go home
covered in mud.

10:42.375 --> 10:45.166
We'll just have to call
your house and say that
you need to stay

10:45.166 --> 10:47.000
at Meowland
until tomorrow.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.208
I get to stay another day?

10:51.958 --> 10:54.125
Thank you, thank you,
thank you!

10:54.125 --> 10:55.291
Thank you, thank you!

10:55.291 --> 10:56.708
Uh, what did we do
that made her go

10:56.708 --> 10:58.750
"Thank you, thank you,
thank you" so much?

10:58.750 --> 11:01.875
It's because we got her
so muddy and covered in ick.

11:01.875 --> 11:04.375
Now she gets to stay here
because they have
to clean her up.

11:04.375 --> 11:06.125
Well, if Hissy's happy,
I'm happy.

11:07.958 --> 11:09.875
I can't wait for Hissy
to get home.

11:10.875 --> 11:12.333
ARF cannot wait, either.

11:12.333 --> 11:14.958
Hissy has been gone
for two whole days,

11:14.958 --> 11:18.375
and ARF gets very lonely
after two days without Hissy.

11:18.375 --> 11:19.750
-(door opens)
-Bob: Hey, everybody!

11:19.750 --> 11:22.208
-(dogs barking)
-Look who I brought home
from Meowland!

11:22.208 --> 11:25.291
-Hissy, you're home!
-Oh, we missed you so much!

11:25.291 --> 11:27.208
(barking)

11:27.208 --> 11:29.875
ARF is happy
that Hissy is home, too.

11:29.875 --> 11:32.958
♪ Hissy's home, yeah!
Hissy's home, all right! ♪

11:32.958 --> 11:35.875
Those nice people
at Meowland did a great job

11:35.875 --> 11:38.000
gettin' you lookin' so good!

11:38.000 --> 11:42.375
But I bet
you're ready for a long nap
in your own bed, huh?

11:42.375 --> 11:45.583
-(barking)
-Ha-ha! It looks like
you've got company!

11:45.583 --> 11:50.000
Oh, come on, fellas!
Make some room for your
kitty big sister.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.958
(both sighing)

11:51.958 --> 11:55.208
Aw, the gang's
all back together.

11:55.208 --> 11:57.291
(dogs snoring)

11:57.291 --> 12:01.875
You know, those beds
at Meowland were
a lot more roomy.

12:01.875 --> 12:04.583
Oh, but I missed
sleeping here,

12:04.583 --> 12:06.333
just like this.

12:06.333 --> 12:08.250
Welcome home, Hissy.

12:08.250 --> 12:09.708
(purring)

12:09.708 --> 12:11.208
(giggles)

12:17.000 --> 12:18.958
(Bingo/Rolly speak)

12:18.958 --> 12:20.708
Bingo:
I'm gonna get yours, Rolly!

12:20.708 --> 12:22.500
Rolly:
Except I'm gonna
get yours first!

12:22.500 --> 12:25.000
Come back here, tail!

12:25.000 --> 12:27.458
-(giggling)
-Do you have to do
your tail chasing

12:27.458 --> 12:31.250
right here,
just when I was
trying to nap?

12:31.250 --> 12:33.583
Yes! Because this is
where Rolly yelled,

12:33.583 --> 12:35.583
"Tail chasing contest!"

12:35.583 --> 12:37.375
(laughing)

12:37.375 --> 12:41.250
But didn't Bob invent
a toy for you to chase
each other around on?

12:41.250 --> 12:44.375
That's right!
The Tag-a-Tail!

12:46.125 --> 12:48.000
Hmm, I don't think
our Tag-A-Tail's gonna work

12:48.000 --> 12:49.750
with all that stuff
piled on it.

12:49.750 --> 12:53.000
So we'll have to un-pile it
until it does work.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.458
(both grunting)

12:56.208 --> 12:59.625
-(crashing)
-Bob: Aah, oh!

12:59.625 --> 13:01.708
Whoa! Oh! Whoa!

13:01.708 --> 13:03.833
(barking)

13:03.833 --> 13:06.291
Everything is going
wrong this morning.

13:06.291 --> 13:09.083
First, my pajamas ripped
when I got out of bed.

13:09.083 --> 13:12.166
Oh, then I squirted
toothpaste all over my face.

13:12.166 --> 13:15.375
And now I can't find
my car keys!

13:15.375 --> 13:16.375
Aw.

13:19.458 --> 13:20.583
Ow!

13:22.958 --> 13:24.166
Huh?

13:24.166 --> 13:27.875
Oh, no!
Those were the drawings
for the new dog house

13:27.875 --> 13:29.083
I was designing!

13:29.083 --> 13:31.000
ARF is sorry.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.958
Ah, it's not your fault, ARF.

13:32.958 --> 13:35.708
I've been having bad luck
all morning.

13:35.708 --> 13:37.750
And since I can't find
my car keys,

13:37.750 --> 13:40.000
I'll have to walk to work.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.750
Maybe by the time I get home,

13:41.750 --> 13:45.166
I'll have actually found
some good luck instead.

13:45.166 --> 13:48.000
-(thunder booming)
-(rain pattering)

13:48.000 --> 13:50.125
(Bob groans)

13:50.125 --> 13:53.125
I wish we could make
Bob's day better by finding
him some good luck.

13:53.125 --> 13:55.708
Me, too.
But I wouldn't even know
where to look.

13:55.708 --> 13:56.958
Me, neither.

13:56.958 --> 13:59.000
But we know someone who does!

14:00.000 --> 14:03.833
So, the two of you need
to find some good luck, huh?

14:03.833 --> 14:05.625
Yeah, that's gonna be
our mission.

14:05.625 --> 14:08.166
It's just, we don't know exactly
what it is we should bring Bob

14:08.166 --> 14:09.875
that'll bring him good luck.

14:09.875 --> 14:11.500
Let me ask you guys somethin'.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.583
Have you ever heard
of a good luck charm?

14:13.583 --> 14:16.125
Have we ever heard
of a good luck charm?

14:16.125 --> 14:18.125
Bingo, have we ever heard
of a good luck charm?

14:18.125 --> 14:20.833
-No.
-Then settle in,
'cause ol' Bulworth's

14:20.833 --> 14:24.333

Do you have any idea
where we should go find one?

15:42.958 --> 15:47.000
Mm-hm.
I know exactly
where you should go.

15:48.166 --> 15:50.375
Bingo:
Four-leaf clover,
here we come!

15:52.166 --> 15:54.625
Esther:
Isn't Ireland
wonderful, Frank?

15:54.625 --> 15:57.166
Historic castles,
rolling green hills,

15:57.166 --> 16:01.208
and beautiful clover fields
as far as the eyes can see.

16:01.208 --> 16:04.708
And if you're really lucky,
Frank, you might find
a four-leaf clover

16:04.708 --> 16:06.291
in one of those fields!

16:06.291 --> 16:08.000
I'm just sayin'.

16:09.125 --> 16:10.125
Did you hear that, Bingo?

16:10.125 --> 16:12.625
Okay, so we came
to the right place.

16:16.208 --> 16:18.750
Look out, Ireland,
here comes Frank and Esther.

16:20.375 --> 16:22.500
And watch out,
lucky four-leaf clovers.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.708
Here come Bingo and Rolly!

16:26.291 --> 16:29.000
So, how are we gonna know
a four-leaf clover
when we find it?

16:29.000 --> 16:32.208
Well, it'll be a clover
that has four leaves.

16:32.208 --> 16:34.583
Four leaves, four leaves...

16:34.583 --> 16:36.375
Hey, there's one right there!

16:39.833 --> 16:43.125
♪ I found a clover,
it has four leaves on it ♪

16:43.125 --> 16:45.416
Rolly, that only has
three leaves.

16:45.416 --> 16:49.125
Nuh-uh!
One, two, three, four.

16:49.125 --> 16:51.208
You counted
the first leaf twice.

16:51.208 --> 16:52.458
Are you sure?

16:52.458 --> 16:56.875
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

16:56.875 --> 16:58.875
is a seven-leaf clover lucky?

16:58.875 --> 17:01.208
Let's just keep looking.

17:01.208 --> 17:05.250
-Did you hear that?
-It sounded kind of rumble-y
and people-y.

17:05.250 --> 17:07.333
Look out!

17:07.333 --> 17:09.166
Where do you think
they're going in such a hurry?

17:09.166 --> 17:11.416
Looks like they're playing
some sort of game
with that ball.

17:11.416 --> 17:13.875
Oh! And they're coming back
this way!

17:13.875 --> 17:19.250
Oh, those people
really wanna grab that ball,
don't they, Rolly?

17:19.250 --> 17:21.000
Rolly?

17:21.000 --> 17:25.166
(Rolly giggling)
This game is fun!

17:25.166 --> 17:26.375
Bingo:
Gotcha!

17:27.375 --> 17:29.958
-Nice catch, Bingo.
-Thanks.

17:29.958 --> 17:32.333
But I think we're
gonna have to look
in a different field.

17:32.333 --> 17:34.583
One without people
who think you're a ball.

17:38.250 --> 17:41.833
Looky here, Frank.
It says that this ancient castle

17:41.833 --> 17:44.375
was abandoned
hundreds of years ago,

17:44.375 --> 17:47.333
when the drawbridge
stopped working.

17:49.375 --> 17:51.333
And that path
leading to the moat

17:51.333 --> 17:53.250
is overgrown with clovers!

17:53.250 --> 17:56.166
Looks like no one
has lived here in forever.

17:58.708 --> 18:00.458
Bingo:
There has to be
a four-leaf clover

18:00.458 --> 18:02.416
in there for Bob somewhere.

18:02.416 --> 18:05.000
Yeah!
All we have to do
is find it!

18:05.000 --> 18:07.333
So let's start lookin'!

18:07.333 --> 18:09.000
Both:
Whee!

18:09.000 --> 18:12.333
One, two, three, not four.

18:12.333 --> 18:14.833
Rolly:
One, two, three, nope.

18:14.833 --> 18:18.125
Bingo:
One, two, three...

18:18.125 --> 18:21.333
I don't know how many times
I counted to three.

18:21.333 --> 18:23.750
Yeah, if I'd been counting
how many times I counted,

18:23.750 --> 18:25.458
I would've totally lost count.

18:25.458 --> 18:28.458
I guess we should check
that last one before
we get going.

18:29.875 --> 18:34.583
One, two, three...
Hey, Bingo, what comes
after three?

18:34.583 --> 18:35.875
-Four.
-I knew that.

18:35.875 --> 18:37.166
I just wanted to make sure.

18:37.166 --> 18:39.166
It's a four-leaf clover!

18:39.166 --> 18:41.125
Look at that!
You found one!

18:42.125 --> 18:44.125
We did it!
High paw!

18:44.125 --> 18:46.333
No! Not with that paw!

18:46.333 --> 18:48.708
(wind whistling)

18:50.875 --> 18:53.458
Oops. I guess
there's a time
to high paw

18:53.458 --> 18:54.875
and a time not to high paw.

18:54.875 --> 18:57.166
And there's a time
to follow that clover.

18:57.166 --> 18:58.250
Which is right now!

18:59.750 --> 19:01.875
(grunting)

19:05.958 --> 19:08.250
(grunting)

19:10.000 --> 19:11.291
Whoa!

19:11.291 --> 19:12.458
Whoa!

19:14.291 --> 19:17.875
-I'm good!
-Okay, then,
let's hop up that wall!

19:17.875 --> 19:21.250
Both:
Hop! Hop! Hop!
Hop! Hop! Hop!

19:25.416 --> 19:27.583
-Uh-oh...
-Rolly, we gotta
hop faster!

19:27.583 --> 19:30.583
Both:
Hop! Hop! Hop! Hop!

19:30.583 --> 19:33.125
Hop! Hop! Hop! Hop!

19:39.375 --> 19:40.708
So that just happened.

19:40.708 --> 19:41.833
Yep.

19:43.375 --> 19:45.458
(gasps)
Rolly, look!

19:45.458 --> 19:47.958
Rolly:
Bob's four-leaf clover!

19:47.958 --> 19:49.208
But how are we gonna
get down there?

19:49.208 --> 19:50.500
It's way too high to jump.

19:50.500 --> 19:53.375
So it's good thing Bob
put parachutes in our collars.

19:57.083 --> 19:59.208
(giggles)
I love it up here!

19:59.208 --> 20:00.708
I could float in the sky
like this forever!

20:00.708 --> 20:03.833
Me, too!
Except I think
we already landed.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.416
Okay, let's grab that
four-leaf clover,

20:09.416 --> 20:12.250
and take it back to Bob
so he can have a good,
lucky day!

20:12.250 --> 20:14.000
Okay, I'll grab it.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.750
We can put it in my collar.

20:15.750 --> 20:18.708
Bob made these things
so there's room in there
for everything.

20:18.708 --> 20:20.875
Great!
Let's go!

20:22.416 --> 20:25.000
But how are we gonna get out?

20:25.000 --> 20:27.333
Oh! It's just like
that lady said.

20:27.333 --> 20:30.250
That drawbridge is the only door
out of here, and remember?

20:30.250 --> 20:32.291
It hasn't worked
in, like, forever!

20:32.291 --> 20:35.416
Hmm. Well, how about we use
those little doggy drawbridges?

20:35.416 --> 20:37.083
Let's do it!

20:37.083 --> 20:38.625
(grunting)

20:44.250 --> 20:46.250
I guess the whole
thing is stuck.

20:46.250 --> 20:47.291
Hmm.

20:48.708 --> 20:51.500
I think to get that drawbridge
workin', we're gonna
need someone

20:51.500 --> 20:54.291
who's really strong
to push against this lever,

20:54.291 --> 20:57.708
and then we'll need someone
who's really fast to run
on that wheel.

20:57.708 --> 21:00.083
Hey, we're someone
who's really strong!

21:00.083 --> 21:02.166
And also someone
who's really fast!

21:02.166 --> 21:05.583
Which means it's time
for some Bingo and Rolly power!

21:05.583 --> 21:07.458
-On your bark...
-Get set...

21:07.458 --> 21:08.500
Go!

21:08.500 --> 21:11.583
(grunting)

21:11.583 --> 21:12.750
Go, Bingo!

21:14.458 --> 21:15.875
It's moving!

21:18.083 --> 21:19.708
'Cause of Bingo
and Rolly power!

21:21.333 --> 21:22.458
(grunts)

21:24.708 --> 21:25.750
(thuds)

21:25.750 --> 21:27.208
-Hurray!
-Yay!

21:27.208 --> 21:30.166
(both coughing)

21:32.166 --> 21:34.375
Bow to the wow, yeah!

21:34.375 --> 21:37.458
It's time for these dogs
to go on a walk,
right on out of here!

21:37.458 --> 21:41.500
With a four-leaf clover that'll
give Bob all the good luck
he needs!

21:47.458 --> 21:49.250
ARF is getting closer!

21:49.250 --> 21:50.833
Do you really think so?

21:50.833 --> 21:52.458
'Cause you feel pretty much
as far away as when we started.

21:52.458 --> 21:54.458
Hey!
You got it working!

21:54.458 --> 21:58.875
Yeah, but I don't think
ARF understands that we're
just going around and around.

21:58.875 --> 22:03.333
ARF will keep running
until he catches
Hissy's tail!

22:03.333 --> 22:05.458
Good luck with that.
Where have you guys been?

22:05.458 --> 22:09.208
We went to Ireland
and found this.

22:09.208 --> 22:11.083
It's a four-leaf clover.

22:11.083 --> 22:13.625
Oh, those are supposed
to bring good luck, right?

22:13.625 --> 22:15.416
Yeah, 'cause that's what
we want for Bob!

22:16.583 --> 22:18.375
I'm home!

22:18.375 --> 22:19.583
-(laughs)
-(barking)

22:19.583 --> 22:22.458
Boy! Did this day
turn out great!

22:22.458 --> 22:26.125
I was havin' such bad luck
because I couldn't find
my car keys

22:26.125 --> 22:27.958
and had to walk home
from work.

22:27.958 --> 22:30.708
Right past a TV store.

22:30.708 --> 22:34.750
One of the TVs had a news story
about this old castle
in Ireland

22:34.750 --> 22:37.458
with a broken drawbridge
that started working

22:37.458 --> 22:39.500
after hundreds of years!

22:39.500 --> 22:41.583
-That's where we were!
-We found a four-leaf
clover and...

22:41.583 --> 22:43.416
-(barking)
-Seeing that news story
gave me an idea

22:43.416 --> 22:47.458
for a new dog house design
that's way better than the one
I spilled paint on

22:47.458 --> 22:48.708
this morning!

22:48.708 --> 22:51.833
I call it the Canine Castle.

22:51.833 --> 22:54.000
It's got these cool
castle walls,

22:54.000 --> 22:56.625
and a drawbridge
where the dogs can go
in and out.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.583
-Like how we got out!
-Let me see!

22:58.583 --> 23:00.000
Whoopsie! (laughs)

23:00.000 --> 23:03.833
Just need to get that out
from under there, and--

23:03.833 --> 23:05.958
(grunts)
Wait a minute.

23:05.958 --> 23:07.500
What's this?

23:07.500 --> 23:11.208
My keys!
They were under the couch
this whole time!

23:11.208 --> 23:13.875
How lucky am I
to have found them like that!

23:15.291 --> 23:17.500
It worked!
We did it, Bingo!

23:17.500 --> 23:19.875
Bob got his good luck!
Just like he wanted!

23:19.875 --> 23:23.416
And I'll tell you what makes me
feel even luckier.

23:23.416 --> 23:27.375
I get to come home
to all of you every day!

23:27.375 --> 23:30.333
(dogs giggle)

23:33.458 --> 23:35.750
(theme music playing)

23:35.750 --> 23:36.875
Bark! Bark! Bark!

23:40.833 --> 23:42.208
Bark! Bark! Bark!

23:43.625 --> 23:44.875
(record scratching)

23:52.208 --> 23:53.208
Bark!

23:56.708 --> 23:58.000
Bark! Bark! Bark!
