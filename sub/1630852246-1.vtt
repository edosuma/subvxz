Yeah. Actually,
you wrote a lot of stuff in here. Um…

10:09.208 --> 10:10.875
It was a lot to follow.

10:10.958 --> 10:13.083
Th… Th… Th… This is…
[stammering]

10:13.166 --> 10:16.375
I've never… I've…
I've never met you before.

10:16.458 --> 10:19.166
I tech… Technically… Mm…
I mean, technically, I did…

10:19.250 --> 10:21.750
All right, settle down.
You're not in trouble.

10:21.833 --> 10:25.125
People don't usually recognize me
without my general helmet,

10:25.208 --> 10:29.083
but it's, uh, it's broken at the moment.
Gotta get it repaired.

10:29.916 --> 10:34.916
Sounds like we'll be fighting a war
in both our world and this Centaurworld.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.875
Oh, my gosh. You believe me?

10:36.958 --> 10:40.750
Some of us have always believed
there was a time before the war

10:40.833 --> 10:43.250
when this world was connected to another.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.041
The hope of magic in the universe

10:46.125 --> 10:50.458
is one of the few things
that kept us gnarled, old warriors going.

10:51.375 --> 10:54.833
I'll need my best soldiers
and they'll need their best horses.

10:54.916 --> 10:57.833
And you get Becky.

10:57.916 --> 11:01.833
What? Really?
You're… You're giving me your horse?

11:01.916 --> 11:04.333
That's not my horse. That's Gary's horse.

11:04.833 --> 11:07.041
Though we haven't seen
that guy in a while.

11:08.041 --> 11:09.500
Oh.

11:09.583 --> 11:10.416
Thanks?

11:10.500 --> 11:12.458
[General chuckles] Don't thank me yet.

11:25.083 --> 11:27.750
-Psst, Horse.
-Yes, I know. Hi.

11:27.833 --> 11:29.041
Where have you been?

11:29.125 --> 11:31.541
We were back there with the luggage.

11:31.625 --> 11:35.625
Surprisingly,
there's very little security here. Also--

11:35.708 --> 11:37.333
-You don't need to whisper.
-[bings]

11:37.416 --> 11:40.166

Ah! Shoo! Shoo!

11:42.500 --> 11:44.583
[chittering]

11:44.666 --> 11:46.875
Stabby was very uncomfortable.

11:46.958 --> 11:48.166
[snarls]

11:48.750 --> 11:49.625
Stabby?

11:49.708 --> 11:53.083
[hissing] My name is Phillip Bonecrunch.

11:53.750 --> 11:56.750
But you were stabbed,
so you're Stabby now.

11:56.833 --> 11:59.208
And you can call me Daddleton.

11:59.291 --> 12:03.333
Yeah, whatever. The horsetaurs
are about to show their feats of strength.

12:03.833 --> 12:06.750
-[horsetaurs] The Duchess!
-The Duchess!

12:08.666 --> 12:10.791

12:23.708 --> 12:25.125
That must be the leader.

12:25.208 --> 12:29.333
Well, look at the boulder shoulders
on these two.

12:29.416 --> 12:33.791
Ooh, their heads are so much smaller
than their bodies!

12:33.875 --> 12:36.958
What's that? Ooh!
Big announcement. That's right.

12:37.041 --> 12:40.625
Thank you all for joining us for high tea.

12:40.708 --> 12:42.375
Who's a what now?

12:43.041 --> 12:47.166
Oh, you're right. No one cares about tea.
We know what you're here for.

12:47.250 --> 12:51.125
It's almost time
to watch these big boys go!

12:51.208 --> 12:52.666
[grunts]

12:52.750 --> 12:56.291
Guys, these are our future allies
about to show their stuff.

12:56.375 --> 12:58.916
Oh, grease lads, grease me.

13:43.208 --> 13:46.791
Oh, what do you think of that?
He's gone and stepped on a tulip.

13:46.875 --> 13:49.583
As you all know,
and the name poorly implies,

13:49.666 --> 13:52.333
the one who steps on a tulip first

13:52.416 --> 13:53.833

that none of this is normal.

14:15.250 --> 14:17.875
I gotta get to the sprinkle spronkle

14:18.500 --> 14:22.333
Well, that's news to me. Off I go!

14:24.083 --> 14:25.541
What a doo-doo show. [laughing]

14:25.625 --> 14:29.958
All right, Ched. So they do that.
Doesn't mean they can't be good warriors.

14:30.041 --> 14:32.375
I'm just gonna…
I'm gonna go talk to her.

14:32.875 --> 14:34.458

-Ah!

14:35.375 --> 14:40.208
Bellhop! I told you to put
The Lady Wighair Beanzs' accoutrement

14:40.291 --> 14:41.833
in the luggage room.

14:41.916 --> 14:46.791
Oh, no. Please don't put me back
in the room with everybody's valuables.

14:46.875 --> 14:48.625
[Glendale] Oof, I hate it.

14:48.708 --> 14:50.708
[classical music playing]

14:52.125 --> 14:54.125
Ched, why are you even here?

14:54.208 --> 14:55.541
I know these guys.

14:55.625 --> 14:57.750
You could say we have a history.

14:58.625 --> 15:00.041
You might need my help.

15:00.125 --> 15:01.916
A history? [chuckles]

15:02.000 --> 15:04.291
Okay, whatever.
We'll talk about this another time.

15:04.375 --> 15:07.000
You, me, brunch,
virgin Bloody Marys, whatever.

15:07.083 --> 15:09.750
There you go with brunch.
We never get together for brunch.

15:09.833 --> 15:11.208
Uh, hi. Excuse--

15:11.291 --> 15:12.958
I'm getting powdered.

The Wighair Beanzses have been attending
high tea for centaur-ies!

Call me by my first name.

15:27.458 --> 15:29.333
Sure, uh, okay. Um… Uh…

[clears throat]

16:21.541 --> 16:23.458
Centaurworld needs you.

16:23.541 --> 16:25.875
Not everyone has walls like these
to protect them.

16:25.958 --> 16:29.125
Oh, you mean the poors? Course they don't.

16:29.208 --> 16:32.791
They're poor!
That's why we call them that. [laughing]

16:41.458 --> 16:45.000
You've got all these weapons
and a literal fortress.

16:45.083 --> 16:49.041
You have the opportunity to use
all this stuff to help Centaurworld.

16:49.125 --> 16:52.583
[gasps]
There's a word for that. It's privilege!

16:52.666 --> 16:53.791
[laughing]

16:53.875 --> 16:56.208
Also, do I though? Hm?

16:56.291 --> 17:00.375
Yes. Without your help,
everyone in Centaurworld will die.

17:00.458 --> 17:05.416
Okay, so what you're saying is
if I don't use my privilege,

17:05.500 --> 17:08.791
we'll have less riffraffity?
