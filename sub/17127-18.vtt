WEBVTT

00:03.734 --> 00:06.137
MORNING, MR. NEEDLES.
 MORNING, MAX.

00:06.137 --> 00:08.209
MORNING, KID I DON´T KNOW.

00:08.209 --> 00:10.141
HI, I´M ALLISON.

00:10.141 --> 00:12.643
HI, I´M GEORGE.

00:14.745 --> 00:17.148
SINCE WHEN DID MAX START
 HANGING OUT WITH GIRLS?

00:17.148 --> 00:21.152
OH, THAT´S NOT JUST A GIRL.
 THAT´S MAX´S WIFE.

00:21.152 --> 00:23.194
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

00:23.194 --> 00:25.096
IT´S SOMETHING ALL THE KIDS
 HIS AGE ARE DOING.

00:25.096 --> 00:26.657
THEY JUST PAIR OFF
 AND SAY THEY´RE MARRIED.

00:26.657 --> 00:29.100
THEY DON´T KISS OR ANYTHING.

00:29.100 --> 00:31.102
I´M GLAD HE´S FINALLY SHOWING
 AN INTEREST IN GIRLS.

00:31.102 --> 00:33.204
THIS MORNING, HE TUCKED HIS
 SHIRT IN AND COMBED HIS HAIR,

00:33.204 --> 00:35.406
AND LAST NIGHT AFTER HE WENT
 TO THE BATHROOM,

00:35.406 --> 00:37.208
HE PUT THE SEAT DOWN.

00:37.208 --> 00:38.809
I´M LOSING HIM.

00:38.809 --> 00:42.543
WELL, I´D KEEP MY EYE
 ON MAX´S WIFE.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.675
SHE´S ON HER THIRD
 JUICY JUICE.

00:44.675 --> 00:47.078
I THINK SHE HAS
 A PROBLEM.

00:47.078 --> 00:49.350
YOU KNOW...

00:52.723 --> 00:56.187
RUMOR HAS IT SOMEONE HERE
 TIED THE KNOT.

00:56.187 --> 00:57.828
STUPID CARMEN.

00:57.828 --> 01:00.161
YEAH, WE GOT MARRIED,
 BUT IT´S NO BIG DEAL.

01:00.161 --> 01:02.133
WELL, I´M SORRY I MISSED
 THE BACHELOR PARTY

01:02.133 --> 01:03.764
AT CHUCK E. CHEESE.

01:03.764 --> 01:07.438
I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO PUTTING
 A DOLLAR IN THE MOUSE´S BELT.

01:12.703 --> 01:16.607
COME ON, PUMPKIN.
 LET´S GO TO SCHOOL.

01:16.607 --> 01:21.312
HERE, HONEY, I MADE YOU
 A FRESH BROWNIE FOR LUNCH.

01:21.312 --> 01:23.714
YOU KNOW
 THOSE MAKE YOU HYPER.

01:23.714 --> 01:25.816
HERE WE GO.

01:32.193 --> 01:33.264
WHASSUP?

01:33.264 --> 01:34.695
CURTIS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING

01:34.695 --> 01:36.867
WITH ALL THOSE BOXES
 FROM THE BASEMENT?

01:36.867 --> 01:39.400
I GOT TO ENTER ALL THESE
 OLD EMPLOYEE FILES

01:39.400 --> 01:41.602
FOR BACKGROUND CHECKS.
 IT´S FOR THAT STUPID

01:41.602 --> 01:43.204
GOVERNMENT CONTRACT
 WE´RE TRYING TO LAND.

01:43.204 --> 01:45.376
HEY, IF WE´RE DOING
 BACKGROUND CHECKS,

01:45.376 --> 01:47.107
I WOULDN´T BE CALLING
 THE GOVERNMENT STUPID.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.109
PLEASE DON´T TAKE ME,
 I LIKE IT HERE!

01:49.109 --> 01:51.342
DUDE, IT´S GOING
 TO TAKE ME FOREVER, MAN.

01:51.342 --> 01:53.644
I GOT TO LUG EACH ONE OF THESE
 SPIDER-INFESTED BOXES

01:53.644 --> 01:56.116
UP HERE ONE AT A TIME.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.888
JUST DON´T LET ´EM
 GET IN YOUR HAIR.

01:57.888 --> 02:00.391
THE MAMA SPIDERS
 LAY EGGS.

02:00.391 --> 02:02.393
YEAH, RIGHT, LIKE I´M SOME
 LITTLE PUNK AFRAID

02:02.393 --> 02:05.556
OF BABY SPIDERS.

02:05.556 --> 02:09.460
MAN, YOU PLAY TOO MUCH!
 GO!

02:09.460 --> 02:11.832
THAT´S YOUR PROBLEM.
 YOU PLAY TOO MUCH!

02:13.304 --> 02:15.736
HEY, GUYS, MAKE SURE CURTIS
 HAS ALL YOUR CURRENT

02:15.736 --> 02:17.768
PERSONAL INFORMATION BECAUSE
 WE´RE DOING BACKGROUND CHECKS.

02:17.768 --> 02:20.241
WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY´S
 CLEAN FOR THE FEDS.

02:20.241 --> 02:22.273
WHAT ARE THEY CHECKING US FOR?

02:22.273 --> 02:25.376
I MEAN, I CAN SEE WHY
 THEY´RE CHECKING HOSNI.

02:25.376 --> 02:27.378
HE´S AN ARAB.

02:27.378 --> 02:30.181
YEAH, AND HE DOESN´T DRINK.
 HOW SUSPICIOUS IS THAT?

02:30.181 --> 02:34.425
OR CURSE. ONE TIME I DROPPED
 A PIPE ON HIS FOOT...

02:34.425 --> 02:37.488
NOTHING.

02:37.488 --> 02:39.930
YOU KNOW, IT´S A GREAT DAY
 IN AMERICA

02:39.930 --> 02:42.333
WHEN WHITE PEOPLE,
 BLACK PEOPLE, AND LATINOS

02:42.333 --> 02:44.935
CAN ALL COME TOGETHER
 AND PICK ON ANOTHER MINORITY.

02:48.369 --> 02:49.840
WHAT´S WRONG
 WITH YOU GUYS?

02:49.840 --> 02:51.672
JUST ´CAUSE HE DOES HIS WORK
 AND DOESN´T HANG AROUND

02:51.672 --> 02:54.275
AND GOSSIP, YOU THINK
 HE´S SUSPICIOUS?

02:54.275 --> 02:56.707
YEAH.
 YEAH. YEAH.

02:56.707 --> 02:58.449
HEY, HE´S BEEN HERE
 FOR TWO YEARS, AND I HAVEN´T

02:58.449 --> 03:00.351
SEEN ONE OF YOU MAKE ANY
 ATTEMPT TO GET TO KNOW HIM.

03:00.351 --> 03:02.953
WELL, I HAVEN´T SEEN YOU
 HANGING AROUND WITH HIM,

03:02.953 --> 03:05.556
MR. WE ARE THE WORLD.

03:05.556 --> 03:07.888
YOU KNOW, YOU´RE RIGHT.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.560
THAT ENDS RIGHT NOW.

03:09.560 --> 03:10.921
HEY, HOSNI.

03:10.921 --> 03:12.623
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
 FRIDAY NIGHT?

03:12.623 --> 03:14.465
IS THIS ABOUT OVERTIME,

03:14.465 --> 03:17.428
BECAUSE I CAN´T DO IT
 ON FRIDAYS.
 OH. SOMETHING RELIGIOUS?

03:17.428 --> 03:20.531
NO, I LIKE TO WATCH "AMERICA´S
 FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS."

03:20.531 --> 03:22.833
BUT I DO IT RELIGIOUSLY.

03:22.833 --> 03:25.336
LISTEN, WHY DON´T YOU COME OVER
 AND HAVE DINNER

03:25.336 --> 03:27.738
WITH ME AND MY FAMILY?
 WE´VE NEVER HUNG OUT.

03:27.738 --> 03:30.341
I DON´T KNOW ANYTHING
 ABOUT YOU, YOUR LIFE,

03:30.341 --> 03:31.842
YOUR CULTURE.
 IT´LL BE FUN.

03:31.842 --> 03:33.914
ALL RIGHT, HOW MANY OF MY WIVES
 CAN I BRING?

03:33.914 --> 03:36.417
IF WE HIT IT OFF, MAN,
 I´LL LET YOU HAVE ONE OF MINE.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.749
HER NAME´S BENNY.

03:38.749 --> 03:41.592
GEORGE, WE GOTTA TALK.

03:41.592 --> 03:42.993
SURE, JACK, WHAT´S UP?

03:42.993 --> 03:45.396
I GOT A BIG PROBLEM
 I NEED YOU TO HANDLE.

03:45.396 --> 03:48.659
WE´RE WORRIED THE GOVERNMENT´S
 GOING TO THROW UP A RED FLAG

03:48.659 --> 03:50.261
ON HOSE-NI.

03:50.261 --> 03:50.961
HAWS-NI.

03:50.961 --> 03:52.603
WHATEVER.

03:52.603 --> 03:54.805
I DON´T WANT HIM TO BE
 THE HEAD INSPECTOR ON THIS.

03:54.805 --> 03:57.007
I´M AFRAID WE MIGHT LOSE
 OUR SHOT AT THIS CONTRACT.

03:57.007 --> 03:59.610
JACK, SO JUST ´CAUSE
 HE´S AN ARAB

03:59.610 --> 04:01.642
YOU GOT A PROBLEM
 WITH HIM?

04:01.642 --> 04:04.345
NO, GEORGE, WE FOUND OUT
 HE WENT TO FLIGHT SCHOOL.

04:04.345 --> 04:07.878
DID HE TAKE ALL THE LESSONS?

04:07.878 --> 04:10.351
LOOK, I´M WANT HIM OFF THE LINE
 AND SHUFFLING PAPERS

04:10.351 --> 04:11.582
TILL I TELL YOU DIFFERENT.

04:11.582 --> 04:13.884
OH, MAN, I JUST INVITED HIM
 TO DINNER.

04:13.884 --> 04:17.958
OH, ROOKIE MISTAKE, GEORGE.

04:17.958 --> 04:21.632
YOU CANNOT GET CLOSE
 TO YOUR EMPLOYEES.

04:21.632 --> 04:23.864
YOU LIKE ME?

04:26.497 --> 04:28.799
NOT REALLY.

04:28.799 --> 04:31.802
THAT´S ´CAUSE I DON´T
 LET YOU IN.

04:31.802 --> 04:34.675
YOU KNOW, GEORGE, SOMETIMES,
 LATE AT NIGHT,

04:34.675 --> 04:36.777
I´M BALLED UP
 IN THE FETAL POSITION,

04:36.777 --> 04:38.909
I´M NAKED,
 I´M HOLDING A DOUBLE BOURBON,

04:38.909 --> 04:41.652
AND I AM CRYING LIKE A BABY.

04:41.652 --> 04:44.755
BUT YOU WILL NEVER SEE THAT.

04:44.755 --> 04:47.057
THANK YOU, JACK.

04:47.057 --> 04:48.789
YOU BET.

05:02.503 --> 05:04.335
♫ ALL MY FRIENDS ♫

05:04.335 --> 05:08.008
♫ KNOW THE LOW RIDER ♫

05:08.008 --> 05:11.782
♫ THE LOW RIDER ♫

05:11.782 --> 05:13.384
♫ IS A LITTLE HIGHER ♫

05:39.710 --> 05:42.112
HI, CARMEN, HI, ANGIE.

05:42.112 --> 05:43.544
ANGIE?

05:43.544 --> 05:46.617
I´M SORRY.
 SHOULD I CALL YOU MOM?

05:46.617 --> 05:48.519
ANGIE WILL BE FINE.

05:48.519 --> 05:50.651
UM, MAX, IS YOUR WIFE
 STAYING FOR DINNER,

05:50.651 --> 05:52.052
BECAUSE I´M MAKING SOMETHING
 SPECIAL.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.485
YOUR DAD´S BRINGING SOMEBODY
 OVER FROM WORK.

05:54.485 --> 05:55.686
UM, WELL...

05:55.686 --> 05:57.888
NO. WE ALREADY ATE
 AT MY PARENTS´.

05:57.888 --> 06:00.461
WE´RE JUST GOING TO GO
 AND PLAY IN MAX´S ROOM

06:00.461 --> 06:02.032
FOR A WHILE.

06:02.032 --> 06:04.364
WHAT SHE SAID.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.836
OKAY...

06:05.836 --> 06:08.669
HEY, HOW COME HE CAN HAVE
 A GIRL UP IN HIS ROOM

06:08.669 --> 06:10.871
AND I CAN´T HAVE A BOY
 UP TO MINE?

06:10.871 --> 06:12.873
BECAUSE HE STILL THINKS
 MAKING OUT

06:12.873 --> 06:15.606
IS FINDING QUARTERS
 IN THE COUCH.

06:15.606 --> 06:17.808
I HAVE A SURPRISE
 FOR YOU.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.613
WHOA. COOL, A SUPERBALL.

06:22.613 --> 06:24.655
WHAT´S THIS FOR?

06:24.655 --> 06:26.487
OUR ONE-WEEK ANNIVERSARY.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.559
DON´T PRETEND
 YOU DON´T REMEMBER.

06:28.559 --> 06:31.762
WOW. ONE WEEK.

06:31.762 --> 06:34.865
WHERE HAS THE TIME GONE?

06:34.865 --> 06:36.627
WELL...

06:36.627 --> 06:39.670
WELL...

06:39.670 --> 06:41.732
WHERE´S MY GIFT?

06:45.606 --> 06:47.778
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

06:47.778 --> 06:51.041
IT´S A BIG SURPRISE.

06:59.890 --> 07:01.622
GUM?

07:01.622 --> 07:03.093
SURPRISE.

07:05.025 --> 07:08.659
YOU DON´T CARE ABOUT
 THIS MARRIAGE, DO YOU?

07:08.659 --> 07:10.801
IT´S GRAPE!

07:14.204 --> 07:15.936
[ LAUGHTER ]

07:15.936 --> 07:18.509
HOSNI, I GIVE YOU A LOT
 OF CREDIT FOR COMING TO THE U.S.

07:18.509 --> 07:21.141
I KNOW HOW HARD IT WAS
 FOR MY PARENTS TO LEAVE CUBA.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.514
AND THEY WEREN´T EVEN
 TRYING TO LEAVE.

07:23.514 --> 07:25.716
THEY WENT SWIMMING
 AND CAUGHT A WAVE.

07:25.716 --> 07:28.719
SO, DO YOU EVER
 GET HOMESICK FOR EGYPT?

07:28.719 --> 07:31.622
WELL, WHENEVER I MISS
 THE DESERT AND THE PYRAMIDS,

07:31.622 --> 07:33.824
I JUST FLY TO VEGAS.

07:33.824 --> 07:36.587
YOU FLY?
 YOU FLY THE PLANE?

07:36.587 --> 07:37.828
George: MOM!

07:39.730 --> 07:41.231
YES. MY DAD WAS A PILOT.

07:41.231 --> 07:43.894
THAT´S HOW I GOT IN THIS
 BUSINESS IN THE FIRST PLACE.

07:43.894 --> 07:46.196
WELL, I THINK THAT´S GREAT.

07:46.196 --> 07:49.940
AM I THE ONLY ONE
 WHOSE EYEBROWS ARE RAISED?

07:49.940 --> 07:51.542
YEAH...

07:51.542 --> 07:54.845
BECAUSE YOU PENCIL THEM IN
 THAT WAY.

07:58.809 --> 08:00.811
SORRY.
 IT´S THE NEW SUPERBALL.

08:00.811 --> 08:03.013
OH, THIS ISN´T A SUPERBALL.

08:03.013 --> 08:04.555
YES, IT IS.

08:04.555 --> 08:05.886
IT´S CALLED A DYNABALL,
 BUT IT´S THE SAME THING.

08:05.886 --> 08:07.688
IT´S NOT THE SAME THING.

08:07.688 --> 08:10.861
REAL SUPERBALLS WERE CREATED
 UNDER 50,000 POUNDS OF PRESSURE.

08:10.861 --> 08:13.864
SUPERBALLS BOUNCED HIGHER
 THAN ANY OTHER BALL EVER MADE.

08:13.864 --> 08:15.726
A KID IN ST. LOUIS BOUNCED ONE

08:15.726 --> 08:17.668
AND A KID IN CHICAGO
 LOST AN EYE!

08:17.668 --> 08:20.030
THAT´S HOW GREAT THEY WERE.

08:20.030 --> 08:21.872
I BOUNCED ONE
 ACROSS THE NILE.

08:21.872 --> 08:23.674
WHERE´S THE NILE?

08:23.674 --> 08:25.235
IT´S IN EGYPT.
 THAT´S WHERE HOSNI´S FROM.

08:25.235 --> 08:28.208
LIKE THOSE GUYS ON THE NEWS?
 WHY DO YOU HATE US?

08:28.208 --> 08:29.880
MAX!
 MAX!

08:29.880 --> 08:31.842
HE DOESN´T HATE US.

08:31.842 --> 08:34.615
YOU KNOW IT´S WRONG TO ASSUME
 THINGS ABOUT PEOPLE.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.285
I´M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THAT,
 HOSNI.

08:36.285 --> 08:37.788
WE TRY TO TEACH HIM TO BE COOL

08:37.788 --> 08:39.789
WITH ALL DIFFERENT TYPES
 OF PEOPLE,

08:39.789 --> 08:42.152
BUT APPARENTLY WE MISSED ONE.

08:42.152 --> 08:45.726
I TOLD YOU WE SHOULD HAVE RENTED
 "ALADDIN."

08:46.657 --> 08:48.028
MAX, COME HERE.

08:51.231 --> 08:52.733
YOUR MOM IS RIGHT.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.034
I DON´T HATE YOU.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.966
JUST LIKE ANYWHERE ELSE,
 WHERE I COME FROM,

08:55.966 --> 08:58.208
THERE ARE GOOD PEOPLE
 AND THERE ARE BAD PEOPLE.

08:58.208 --> 08:59.239
WHICH ONE ARE YOU?

08:59.239 --> 09:00.310
I AM GOOD PEOPLE.

09:00.310 --> 09:01.712
OH, OKAY.

09:02.813 --> 09:04.915
HE´S A SWEET KID.

09:04.915 --> 09:06.917
DOES HE BELIEVE EVERYTHING
 ANYBODY TELLS HIM?

09:08.178 --> 09:12.022
HEY, HE STILL THINKS DOING
 YARD WORK IS ASTRONAUT TRAINING.

09:13.884 --> 09:16.887
GEORGE, NEXT TIME
 IT´S MY PLACE.

09:16.887 --> 09:19.129
ANGIE, THANKS FOR
 A GREAT DINNER.

09:19.129 --> 09:20.160
YOU´RE WELCOME.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.762
BENNY.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.063
LIGHTEN UP.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.966
TRY PENCILING IN
 A SMILE ON YOUR FACE.

09:25.966 --> 09:28.168
OH, HOSNI. HA HA HA!

09:30.601 --> 09:32.973
HE´S GOT CRAZY EYES.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.175
HEY, SORRY I MISSED DINNER.

09:35.175 --> 09:37.808
I GUESS I´LL HAVE TO MEET HOSNI
 NEXT TIME.

09:37.808 --> 09:39.810
I DON´T KNOW IF THERE WILL BE
 A NEXT TIME

09:39.810 --> 09:41.752
AFTER WHAT I´M SUPPOSED TO DO
 ON MONDAY.

09:41.752 --> 09:43.153
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

09:43.153 --> 09:44.915
THE POWERS BROTHERS
 ARE WORRIED ABOUT LOSING

09:44.915 --> 09:46.787
THE GOVERNMENT CONTRACT
 BECAUSE OF HOSNI.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.288
THEY WANT ME TO TAKE HIM
 OFF THE PROJECT.

09:48.288 --> 09:50.090
WAIT A SECOND.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.723
YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS BEFORE
 DINNER AND YOU DIDN´T TELL ME?

09:52.723 --> 09:54.865
ANGIE, IF I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU,
 YOU WOULD HAVE TIPPED HIM OFF.

09:54.865 --> 09:56.366
YOU WOULD HAVE USED
 YOUR SYMPATHY VOICE --

09:56.366 --> 10:00.270
[ Gently ] WOULD YOU LIKE
 MORE COFFEE, MAYBE SOME TEA?

10:01.932 --> 10:04.935
THIS ISN´T FAIR TO HOSNI.
 THEY CAN´T DO THIS.

10:04.935 --> 10:06.937
JUST ´CAUSE HE TOOK
 FLYING LESSONS

10:06.937 --> 10:09.740
AND HE´S FROM A TROUBLED
 PART OF THE WORLD.

10:09.740 --> 10:11.311
HEY, WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?

10:11.311 --> 10:13.684
WE´VE GOT TO BUILD AIRPLANES
 FOR THE GOVERNMENT.

10:13.684 --> 10:16.046
HE´S AN ARAB.
 HE´S GOT TO GO.

10:16.046 --> 10:17.888
MOM, HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

10:17.888 --> 10:19.820
HOW MANY TIMES IN YOUR LIFE
 HAVE YOU HAD PEOPLE JUDGE YOU

10:19.820 --> 10:21.191
BECAUSE OF YOUR BACKGROUND?

10:21.191 --> 10:23.193
HEY, WHEN PEOPLE
 DON´T LIKE ME,

10:23.193 --> 10:25.195
THEY DON´T LIKE ME
 BECAUSE THEY KNOW ME.

10:25.195 --> 10:27.127
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
 WITH MY BACKGROUND.

10:28.999 --> 10:31.001
DAD, IF THEY´RE WORRIED
 ABOUT HIM,

10:31.001 --> 10:33.133
MAYBE IT´S BETTER
 IF HE´S NOT MAKING PLANES.

10:33.133 --> 10:36.006
CARMEN, YOU CAN´T JUDGE PEOPLE
 BY THE WAY THEY LOOK.

10:36.006 --> 10:38.008
YOU KNOW, IT HAPPENS TO ME
 ALL THE TIME.

10:38.008 --> 10:40.040
WHEN I GO SHOPPING,
 SECURITY FOLLOWS ME.

10:40.040 --> 10:43.914
WHEN I CUT MY GRASS, PEOPLE WANT
 TO KNOW HOW MUCH I CHARGE.

10:45.876 --> 10:47.377
ONE TIME
 WHEN I WAS PLAYING GOLF,

10:47.377 --> 10:49.149
A GUY PULLS UP TO THE CLUBHOUSE,
 GETS OUT,

10:49.149 --> 10:51.021
AND HANDS ME THE KEYS
 TO HIS CAR.

10:51.021 --> 10:52.382
DAD, WHAT DID YOU DO?

10:52.382 --> 10:54.284
I TOOK IT.

10:54.284 --> 10:56.827
THEN I CALLED HIM
 ON HIS CAR PHONE

10:56.827 --> 11:00.030
AND TOLD HIM
 THAT IT SHAKES AT 110.

11:00.030 --> 11:03.433
DAD, IF HOSNI´S A GOOD GUY
 AND YOU DO THIS,

11:03.433 --> 11:06.436
DOESN´T THAT MAKE YOU
 ONE OF THE BAD GUYS?

11:08.969 --> 11:12.172
NO, BECAUSE I´M GOING TO TELL
 THE POWERS BROTHERS

11:12.172 --> 11:14.274
I CAN´T DO THIS TO HOSNI.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.276
WAY TO GO.
 YOU´RE A DOPE.

11:21.952 --> 11:24.114
ALL RIGHT,
 LET´S GET TO THE FILES.

11:24.114 --> 11:25.716
WHAT´S THIS ABOUT, ANYWAY?

11:25.716 --> 11:27.718
I GOT TO PUT A CASE TOGETHER
 FOR HOSNI

11:27.718 --> 11:29.720
BEFORE THE POWERS BROTHERS
 GET IN.

11:29.720 --> 11:32.723
LOOK AT THE PEOPLE THEY´VE
 ALREADY APPROVED FOR THE JOB.

11:32.723 --> 11:35.996
JOHN PATTERSON --
 THREE STINTS IN REHAB.

11:35.996 --> 11:40.370
MARY SANCHEZ -- 82 YEARS OLD
 AND LEGALLY BLIND!

11:40.370 --> 11:43.373
JOE KRUVITCH --
 FORMER PORN STAR.

11:43.373 --> 11:45.936
HE WAS A PORN STAR?

11:45.936 --> 11:47.337
ONLY FOR A YEAR.

11:47.337 --> 11:50.340
HE MADE 2,000 FILMS.

11:50.340 --> 11:52.042
THIS ISN´T GOING TO WORK, MAN.

11:52.042 --> 11:54.184
LOOK, YOU BRING THIS UP,
 YOU´RE NOT GOING TO HELP HOSNI.

11:54.184 --> 11:55.145
YOU´RE JUST GOING TO GET
 THOSE PEOPLE BUMPED, TOO.

11:55.145 --> 11:56.446
YEAH, YOU´RE PROBABLY RIGHT,

11:56.446 --> 11:58.348
AND I DON´T WANT
 TO SEND JOE BACK TO PORN.

11:58.348 --> 12:00.190
HE´S GOT A BAD BACK.

12:00.190 --> 12:02.022
YOU WANTED TO SEE US, GEORGE?

12:02.022 --> 12:04.224
HEY, CURTIS,
 LET ME TALK TO THESE GUYS.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.897
SO, UH, DID YOU TALK
 TO HOSNI YET?

12:06.897 --> 12:08.899
NO, ´CAUSE I´M NOT
 DEMOTING HIM.

12:08.899 --> 12:10.901
YOU HAD NO PROBLEM
 WITH THE 37 PLANES

12:10.901 --> 12:12.903
HE INSPECTED BEFORE
 THE GOVERNMENT CONTRACT CAME UP,

12:12.903 --> 12:14.504
AND THERE´S NO REASON
 TO HAVE A PROBLEM NOW.

12:14.504 --> 12:15.966
GEORGE, PLEASE --

12:15.966 --> 12:17.407
NO, LET ME FINISH.
 THIS IS PROFILING.

12:17.407 --> 12:19.039
SO WHAT IF HE WENT
 TO FLIGHT SCHOOL?

12:19.039 --> 12:20.370
IF HE WASN´T AN ARAB,

12:20.370 --> 12:22.112
WE WOULDN´T BE HAVING
 THIS CONVERSATION.

12:22.112 --> 12:26.046
IT´S NOT HIS FAULT HE´S NOT SOME
 82-YEAR-OLD EX-PORN STAR

12:26.046 --> 12:28.448
STRAIGHT OUT OF REHAB!

12:28.448 --> 12:30.951
DID YOU FOLLOW THAT?

12:30.951 --> 12:32.352
NO.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.184
GEORGE, LET ME
 SPELL IT OUT FOR YOU.

12:34.184 --> 12:37.127
IF WE DON´T GET THIS CONTRACT,
 WE´RE GOING TO A SKELETON CREW.

12:37.127 --> 12:39.259
WE´LL HAVE TO LAY OFF
 AT LEAST 20 PEOPLE.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.530
NOW, DO YOU WANT THAT
 ON YOUR HEAD?

12:40.530 --> 12:42.262
NO, MAN, I DON´T.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.864
BUT I DON´T WANT TO SCREW
 ONE GUY OUT OF A JOB

12:43.864 --> 12:45.465
BECAUSE YOU TWO GUYS
 ARE PARANOID.

12:45.465 --> 12:48.468
GEORGE, WE ARE NOT CLOSING
 OUR DOORS OVER HOSNI.

12:48.468 --> 12:52.442
I WANT HIM DOING MEANINGLESS
 PAPERWORK BY TOMORROW.

12:52.442 --> 12:55.045
GEORGE, YOU WANT TO
 GET SOMETHING TO EAT?

12:55.045 --> 12:57.447
UH, NO, I CAN´T, MAN.
 I GOT TO WORK THROUGH LUNCH.

12:57.447 --> 12:59.509
GOT PAPERWORK.

12:59.509 --> 13:02.082
WHAT´S BLACK AND RED
 AND MAD AS HELL?

13:02.082 --> 13:04.955
A BROTHER WITH 15 PAPER CUTS.

13:04.955 --> 13:06.016
DAMN!

13:06.016 --> 13:07.057
16.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.460
POOR CURTIS.

13:10.460 --> 13:13.994
I´D RATHER EAT MY OWN HANDS
 THAN BE STUCK DOING PAPERWORK.

13:13.994 --> 13:16.426
YEAH, WELL...

13:16.426 --> 13:18.428
THAT´S...YEAH.

13:24.875 --> 13:26.576
MAX, IS YOUR MOM HOME?
 I GOT TO TALK TO HER.

13:26.576 --> 13:28.208
SHE´S STILL SHOPPING.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.540
BUT, LOOK, I FOUND
 ONE OF THOSE OLD SUPERBALLS

13:30.540 --> 13:33.143
BUT THE AUCTION´S ALMOST OVER.
 CAN WE MAKE A BID?

13:33.143 --> 13:34.845
5 BUCKS?

13:34.845 --> 13:36.416
THEY MUST BE COLLECTIBLES.
 NO, LET´S BID $6.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.849
I DON´T WANT TO LOSE IT.
 LET´S BID $1,000.

13:38.849 --> 13:42.122
OKAY, I´M IN CHARGE
 OF THE BIDDING NOW.

13:42.122 --> 13:44.424
LET´S BID $7.

13:44.424 --> 13:45.996
YOU´VE BEEN OUTBID.

13:45.996 --> 13:47.397
OKAY, $10.

13:47.397 --> 13:48.398
OUTBID.

13:48.398 --> 13:49.399
OKAY, $20.

13:49.399 --> 13:51.001
OUTBID.

13:53.003 --> 13:54.004
$30.

13:54.004 --> 13:55.005
OUTBID.

13:55.005 --> 13:56.006
$50!

13:56.006 --> 13:57.267
GO TO $1,000!

13:57.267 --> 13:58.268
$60!

13:58.268 --> 13:59.539
IT´S OVER! WE WIN!

13:59.539 --> 14:02.142
DAH! WHAT DO
 THE LOPEZ MEN HAVE?

14:02.142 --> 14:03.413
SUPERBALL!

14:03.413 --> 14:04.544
THAT´S RIGHT!

14:04.544 --> 14:06.176
WHAT ARE YOU TELLING HIM?

14:06.176 --> 14:09.880
DAD JUST GOT ME
 AN ORIGINAL SUPERBALL FOR $60.

14:09.880 --> 14:12.022
60 BUCKS
 FOR A LITTLE RUBBER BALL?

14:12.022 --> 14:13.323
CONGRATULATIONS.

14:13.323 --> 14:15.085
YOU´RE OFFICIALLY
 OUT OF THE HOOD.

14:17.157 --> 14:20.891
HEY, DAD, I´M GONNA BUY
 SOME GUM. CAN I HAVE $300?

14:20.891 --> 14:22.963
YOU WANT $300?
 MM-HMM.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.634
I BURIED IT BEHIND
 THE LEMON TREE IN THE BACKYARD.

14:24.634 --> 14:26.396
YOU DIG IT UP,
 YOU CAN HAVE IT.

14:26.396 --> 14:28.368
COOL!
 [ THUD ]

14:28.368 --> 14:29.539
George: OH!

14:29.539 --> 14:32.342
HERE, LET ME HELP YOU.
 YOU OKAY?

14:33.603 --> 14:36.076
DAD, WHY DON´T YOU
 JUST HIRE SOMEBODY

14:36.076 --> 14:37.978
TO DIG THE HOLES
 FOR THE SPRINKLERS?

14:37.978 --> 14:39.649
MAX IS GONNA FIGURE IT OUT
 SOMEDAY.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.513
NOT IF HE KEEPS RUNNING
 INTO THE DOOR.

14:46.256 --> 14:49.889
SO, HOW´D IT GO WITH
 THE POWERS BROTHERS TODAY?

14:49.889 --> 14:51.361
WELL,

14:51.361 --> 14:53.994
SOMETIMES YOU EAT THE BEAR,
 SOMETIMES THE BEAR EATS YOU,

14:53.994 --> 14:56.166
AND SOMETIMES YOU´RE WHAT
 THE BEAR LEAVES BEHIND

14:56.166 --> 14:58.198
IN THE WOODS.

14:59.129 --> 15:00.670
WHAT HAPPENED?

15:00.670 --> 15:03.303
IF I DON´T DEMOTE HOSNI
 AND WE DON´T GET THE CONTRACT,

15:03.303 --> 15:05.205
20 PEOPLE
 ARE GONNA GET LAID OFF.

15:05.205 --> 15:06.336
OH, MY GOD.

15:06.336 --> 15:07.607
I DON´T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.179
WHAT KIND OF EXAMPLE
 AM I FOR MY KIDS

15:09.179 --> 15:10.680
IF I CAN´T STAND UP
 FOR WHAT I BELIEVE IN?

15:10.680 --> 15:12.482
WELL, WHAT KIND OF MANAGER
 WOULD YOU BE

15:12.482 --> 15:14.344
IF YOU LET 20 PEOPLE
 GET FIRED TO SAVE ONE?

15:14.344 --> 15:17.687
THANKS, BABY.
 YOU´RE MY ROCK.

15:17.687 --> 15:20.490
GEORGE, YOU GOT TO MAKE
 A DECISION.

15:20.490 --> 15:23.954
WELL, I CAN EITHER DO
 THE PRACTICAL THING

15:23.954 --> 15:25.956
OR THE RIGHT THING,
 BUT I CAN´T DO BOTH.

15:25.956 --> 15:27.257
AH, I HATE BEING MANAGER.

15:27.257 --> 15:29.229
I HATE HAVING THIS KIND
 OF RESPONSIBILITY.

15:29.229 --> 15:30.600
IT´S KILLING ME.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.632
THAT´S WHY YOU´RE EXACTLY
 THE KIND OF GUY

15:32.632 --> 15:34.164
WHO SHOULD BE MANAGER.

15:34.164 --> 15:36.506
YOU SUFFER LIKE THIS
 BECAUSE YOU ACTUALLY

15:36.506 --> 15:38.238
GIVE A DAMN ABOUT PEOPLE.

15:38.238 --> 15:40.510
NO, I DON´T.

15:40.510 --> 15:41.972
YES, YOU DO.

15:41.972 --> 15:43.643
YOU KNOW MR. SALAZAR
 DOWN THE STREET?

15:43.643 --> 15:46.046
HE´S GOT THAT BIG OPERATION
 COMING UP.

15:46.046 --> 15:48.078
I DON´T CARE.

15:48.078 --> 15:49.449
HE MIGHT NOT MAKE IT.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.321
SO WHAT?

15:51.321 --> 15:53.553
I MADE VEGETABLE SOUP
 FOR HIM.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.455
OH, THAT´S NICE.

16:00.730 --> 16:03.563
MAX, WHAT ARE YOU
 STILL DOING UP?

16:03.563 --> 16:07.067
I COULDN´T SLEEP.
 IT´S MY MARRIAGE.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.638
YEAH?

16:08.638 --> 16:11.371
DAD, DID YOU AND MOM EVER
 WANT TO STOP BEING MARRIED?

16:11.371 --> 16:12.542
NO.

16:12.542 --> 16:14.504
WE´VE BEEN MARRIED
 FOR 16 YEARS,

16:14.504 --> 16:17.177
AND I´M STILL HAPPY
 TO BE WITH HER.

16:17.177 --> 16:19.409
I´VE BEEN WITH ALLISON
 FOR ONE WEEK,

16:19.409 --> 16:21.481
AND IT FEELS LIKE 16 YEARS.

16:21.481 --> 16:24.514
SO, YOU WANT OUT?

16:24.514 --> 16:26.216
MAYBE.

16:26.216 --> 16:29.389
ARE THERE ANY KIDS
 TO WORRY ABOUT?

16:29.389 --> 16:31.361
NOT THAT I KNOW OF.

16:31.361 --> 16:33.563
[ Laughs ]
 YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

16:33.563 --> 16:36.266
NO.

16:36.266 --> 16:38.698
MAX, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
 BREAK UP WITH HER.

16:38.698 --> 16:40.630
CAN YOU DO IT FOR ME?

16:40.630 --> 16:42.702
I THINK YOU SHOULD DO IT.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.704
THAT WAY,
 SHE´LL RESPECT YOU,

16:44.704 --> 16:48.378
AND YOU STILL MAY HAVE
 A CHANCE TO BE FRIENDS.

16:48.378 --> 16:50.580
ARE YOU AFRAID OF HER, TOO?

16:50.580 --> 16:52.112
A LITTLE BIT.

17:03.193 --> 17:05.155
HEY, HOSNI.

17:05.155 --> 17:06.726
GEORGE, WHAT ARE YOU
 DOING HERE SO EARLY?

17:06.726 --> 17:08.528
I´M USUALLY THE FIRST ONE.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.230
I´M WORKING
 ON MY OLD MACHINE.

17:10.230 --> 17:11.531
IT HELPS ME THINK.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.063
FOR A MOMENT, I THOUGHT
 THEY DEMOTED YOU.

17:13.063 --> 17:14.503
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
 HUMILIATING.

17:14.503 --> 17:15.435
HA. YEAH.

17:15.435 --> 17:16.766
YEAH.

17:16.766 --> 17:18.568
WELL, ANYWAY,
 I´M GLAD YOU´RE HERE.

17:18.568 --> 17:20.310
LOOK AT THIS.
 I FOUND AN OLD SUPERBALL

17:20.310 --> 17:22.372
FOR MAX AT A FLEA MARKET.

17:22.372 --> 17:24.114
OH, HEY, MAN, THANKS.

17:24.114 --> 17:27.046
I TRIED TO GET ONE ON eBAY,
 BUT SOME IDIOT

17:27.046 --> 17:29.679
BID IT UP TO 60 BUCKS.

17:29.679 --> 17:33.253
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW...
 YEAH.

17:41.191 --> 17:44.164
YOU´RE HERE EARLY
 FOR A REASON, AREN´T YOU?

17:46.766 --> 17:49.499
LISTEN, HOSNI, THERE´S
 NO EASY WAY TO SAY THIS.

17:49.499 --> 17:51.771
THE POWERS BROTHERS THINK
 WE HAVE A BETTER CHANCE

17:51.771 --> 17:53.643
OF GETTING THE GOVERNMENT JOB
 WITHOUT YOU.

17:53.643 --> 17:55.345
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

17:55.345 --> 17:57.677
IT´S A FLIGHT SCHOOL,
 AND YOU´RE ARAB.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.409
AND THE POWERS BROTHERS THINK
 THAT THE GOVERNMENT´S

17:59.409 --> 18:00.780
GOING TO BECOME SUSPICIOUS,

18:00.780 --> 18:02.452
AND THEY DON´T WANT
 TO TAKE THE CHANCE.

18:02.452 --> 18:03.853
I DON´T BELIEVE THIS.

18:03.853 --> 18:05.655
LOOK, MAN, I´LL MAKE SURE
 YOU GET THE SAME MONEY

18:05.655 --> 18:07.257
AND THE SAME BENEFITS,

18:07.257 --> 18:08.858
BUT I´M NOT GONNA PRETEND
 THIS IS BETTER THAN IT IS.

18:08.858 --> 18:10.860
I MEAN, I KNOW YOU TAKE
 PRIDE IN YOUR WORK,

18:10.860 --> 18:13.092
BUT YOU´RE NOT GONNA BE
 HEAD INSPECTOR, HOSNI.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.695
YOU´RE GONNA BE...
 SHUFFLING PAPERS.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.867
SO I´M BEING PROFILED
 OUT OF A JOB?

18:17.867 --> 18:19.799
YES, AND IT SUCKS,
 AND IT´S A LOUSY WORLD,

18:19.799 --> 18:22.472
BUT IF WE LOSE THIS CONTRACT,
 20 PEOPLE WILL BE OUT OF WORK.

18:22.472 --> 18:25.305
AND I´M THE MANAGER, MAN,
 AND I CAN´T LET THAT HAPPEN.

18:27.337 --> 18:29.279
I UNDERSTAND.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.842
IF IT MAKES YOU
 FEEL BETTER,

18:32.842 --> 18:35.145
JACK POWERS DRINKS NAKED
 AT NIGHT

18:35.145 --> 18:38.688
ROLLED UP
 IN THE FETAL POSITION.

18:39.649 --> 18:41.721
THAT HELPS A LITTLE.

18:43.893 --> 18:46.226
LISTEN, I JUST WANT
 TO THANK YOU

18:46.226 --> 18:48.398
FOR AT LEAST BEING
 HONEST WITH ME.

18:48.398 --> 18:51.431
IT MAKES IT MUCH EASIER
 TO HEAR BAD NEWS LIKE THIS

18:51.431 --> 18:53.303
FROM A FRIEND.

18:53.303 --> 18:56.336
SO YOU GONNA BE ALL RIGHT
 WITH THIS?

18:56.336 --> 18:57.337
HELL, NO.

18:58.868 --> 19:01.911
DO ALL THE LOPEZES BELIEVE
 EVERYTHING ANYBODY TELLS THEM?

19:08.548 --> 19:10.280
YOU´RE VERY QUIET TODAY.

19:10.280 --> 19:12.422
AND STOP PLAYING
 WITH YOUR FOOD.

19:12.422 --> 19:16.155
THERE´S SOMETHING I NEED
 TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.827
OH, BOY. I´LL BE OUTSIDE.

19:17.827 --> 19:21.160
NO, IT´S OKAY.
 WE´RE ALL FAMILY HERE.

19:23.833 --> 19:27.197
NOT FOR LONG.

19:27.197 --> 19:29.199
ALLISON --

19:29.199 --> 19:30.200
I ACCEPT.

19:30.200 --> 19:31.501
HUH?

19:31.501 --> 19:34.204
YOUR APOLOGY.
 I ACCEPT IT.

19:34.204 --> 19:37.607
WE SHOULD HAVE PICKED OUT
 OUR WEEK-IVERSARY GIFT TOGETHER.

19:37.607 --> 19:40.710
ALLISON...

19:47.587 --> 19:49.219
I WANT A DIVORCE.

19:49.219 --> 19:51.791
WHAT? YOU´RE DIVORCING ME?

19:51.791 --> 19:53.763
BUT I WANT YOU
 TO KNOW SOMETHING.

19:53.763 --> 19:55.395
IT´S NOT ME.

19:55.395 --> 19:56.666
IT´S YOU.

19:58.728 --> 20:00.300
I´M SORRY.

20:00.300 --> 20:03.233
YOU´RE NOT GONNA DO
 BETTER THAN ME, MAX LOPEZ.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.209
YOU OKAY?

20:10.209 --> 20:11.611
I GUESS.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.212
IT´S JUST THAT
 ALLISON AND I

20:13.212 --> 20:14.944
WON´T BE PLAYING
 TOGETHER ANYMORE.

20:14.944 --> 20:19.249
I FEEL BAD --
 LIKE IN MY STOMACH.

20:19.249 --> 20:22.252
HEY, THE SUPERBALL
 CAME TODAY.

20:22.252 --> 20:24.624
ALL RIGHT! LET´S GO
 PLAY WITH IT RIGHT NOW!

20:24.624 --> 20:27.397
5 SECOND REBOUND!
 NOT BAD!

20:27.397 --> 20:28.898
HEY!

20:28.898 --> 20:30.800
THIS IS A REAL TOY --
 A BACK-IN-THE-DAY TOY.

20:30.800 --> 20:32.532
ARE YOU READY, MAX?

20:32.532 --> 20:35.265
I´M READY.

20:50.280 --> 20:53.022
THAT IS THE BEST 60 BUCKS
 I´VE EVER SPENT.
