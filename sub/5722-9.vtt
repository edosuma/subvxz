<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

00:09.612 --> 00:11.022
You ever been in
a war zone?

00:12.769 --> 00:14.002
Didn't think so.

00:14.070 --> 00:16.372
There's a line between us
that you drew.

00:16.439 --> 00:20.041
Forget that--
it's a fucking wall.

00:20.109 --> 00:23.178
Stay on our own
sides of it, okay?

00:23.246 --> 00:25.447
Now, listen-- you represent

00:25.515 --> 00:28.684
the greatest penetration
of American intelligence

00:28.752 --> 00:31.086
in fucking history.

00:31.154 --> 00:32.354
You have two choices.

00:32.421 --> 00:35.524
Either we turn you
back over to the CIA

00:35.592 --> 00:37.826
or maybe I can
get you to Israel.

00:37.894 --> 00:39.261
I can't do it.

00:39.329 --> 00:42.664
Welcome to Operation
Iraqi Freedom.

00:43.732 --> 00:45.000
That bad, huh?

00:45.067 --> 00:46.367
Worse. Sit.

00:46.435 --> 00:49.838
What I need is two weeks
in the West Indies.

00:49.906 --> 00:51.339
Saint Lucia.

00:51.407 --> 00:53.641
There's a little bar
on a beach.

00:53.709 --> 00:56.144
Banana Joe's.

00:56.212 --> 00:58.546
Best daiquiris on the planet.

01:01.851 --> 01:03.819
You cannot
take weapons into Syria.

01:03.886 --> 01:05.352
What weapons?

01:18.200 --> 01:19.733
You have to go.

01:19.801 --> 01:21.135
Tovah made a deal with Dar Adal.

01:21.203 --> 01:22.703
He's on his way to get you.

01:22.770 --> 01:24.338
Come, come,
this way.

01:24.405 --> 01:26.106
Did you find the man
you were looking for?

01:26.174 --> 01:28.775
Not exactly,
but I have his laptop.

01:28.844 --> 01:29.776
Carrie.

01:29.845 --> 01:31.778
I'm in Ahmed's computer.

01:33.315 --> 01:35.216
What just happened?

01:35.283 --> 01:37.017
Just a screen saver.

03:34.065 --> 03:35.331
What is this place?

03:35.399 --> 03:37.333
A friend of mine's
son is a sculptor.

03:37.401 --> 03:39.236
Studio's on the third floor.

03:39.303 --> 03:41.071
Thank you.

03:42.273 --> 03:44.107
You broke his heart, you know.

03:44.175 --> 03:47.077
When you lobbied against his bid
for the directorship.

03:48.312 --> 03:49.612
Both our hearts got broken.

03:49.680 --> 03:51.281
Well, his is older,

03:51.348 --> 03:52.715
weaker.

03:54.351 --> 03:57.788
Well, I wish I were
bringing him better news now.

04:29.952 --> 04:31.920
Quickly.

04:45.901 --> 04:48.602
Saul.

04:53.007 --> 04:54.574
Come here.

05:12.793 --> 05:15.062
A screen saver.

05:15.129 --> 05:17.164
A photograph
of the exact same bar

05:17.232 --> 05:19.432
in the West Indies Allison
mentioned all those years ago.

05:19.500 --> 05:20.767
- Mentioned?
- Well...

05:20.835 --> 05:22.535
more than mentioned.

05:22.603 --> 05:23.837
She went on and on about it.

05:23.904 --> 05:25.171
It was her favorite place
on Earth--

05:25.239 --> 05:26.840
the drink, the view,
the gorgeous men.

05:26.907 --> 05:29.275
Well, that's hardly
definitive, Carrie.

05:29.343 --> 05:30.677
It connects her
to Ahmed Nazari.

05:30.745 --> 05:32.278
She's already
connected to him.

05:32.346 --> 05:35.147
You said he was her asset
in Baghdad. An important one.

05:35.215 --> 05:39.218
Well, this suggests a deeper,
more personal relationship.

05:39.286 --> 05:40.754
You mean sexual?

05:40.821 --> 05:43.189
- Well, I'm not sure.
- Well, what, then?

05:44.858 --> 05:46.692
There was some suspicion Nazari
was embezzling American dollars

05:46.760 --> 05:48.494
earmarked
for the justice sector.

05:48.561 --> 05:51.030
- So the motive might be money.
- Well, there was a hell of a lot of it

05:51.098 --> 05:52.731
- floating around at that time.
- True.

05:55.369 --> 05:57.703
I'm still not clear why that
makes you think Allison's

05:57.771 --> 05:59.638
working for
the Russians.

05:59.706 --> 06:01.807
Because Nazari is.

06:01.875 --> 06:04.476
And because who else had access

06:04.544 --> 06:06.945
to your killbox operation
with Quinn?

06:08.815 --> 06:10.716
She wanted me dead, Saul.

06:10.784 --> 06:12.518
She tried three times.

06:12.585 --> 06:14.185
Anything to stop me
from getting a look

06:14.253 --> 06:15.754
at those hacked documents.
Anything to keep

06:15.822 --> 06:17.856
from being exposed
for what she truly is.

06:26.098 --> 06:27.732
You're still not convinced?

06:27.800 --> 06:29.300
Frankly, no.

06:29.367 --> 06:30.735
Why not?

06:30.803 --> 06:32.937
Because I don't want to be.

06:38.677 --> 06:40.878
The implications
are serious, I'm aware.

06:40.946 --> 06:42.947
Implications are catastrophic.

06:43.014 --> 06:44.949
It'd mean the Russians
have been inside

06:45.016 --> 06:47.618
our intelligence apparatus
in Europe for almost a decade.

06:47.686 --> 06:49.119
Exactly.

06:49.187 --> 06:51.221
Which is why you can't
just ignore this, Saul.

06:51.289 --> 06:53.790
You need to know,
one way or the other.

07:46.776 --> 07:48.711
Get up, man.

08:50.606 --> 08:52.139
Good.

09:35.215 --> 09:36.682
Those drums you picked up
in Kosovo--

09:36.750 --> 09:38.417
you have any idea
what was in 'em?

09:38.485 --> 09:39.885
Drink.

09:39.953 --> 09:42.054
You don't have a clue.

09:42.122 --> 09:45.091
Methyl
difluorophosphite.

09:45.158 --> 09:47.526
DF. Combined with
isopropyl alcohol,

09:47.594 --> 09:49.528
it makes sarin gas.

09:50.664 --> 09:51.764
And you've never
killed anyone.

09:51.832 --> 09:52.898
There's enough
in those drums

09:52.966 --> 09:54.934
to kill thousands
of people.

09:55.002 --> 09:56.969
Sarin is a fucked-up
way to die.

09:57.037 --> 09:58.302
Don't talk. Drink.

09:58.370 --> 09:59.504
It attacks the
respiratory center

09:59.571 --> 10:00.739
of the nervous system,

10:00.806 --> 10:02.841
paralyzes the muscles
around the lungs.

10:02.908 --> 10:05.043
You convulse, you vomit,
your bladder

10:05.111 --> 10:06.477
and your bowels evacuate.

10:06.545 --> 10:08.647
Fine.

10:08.714 --> 10:10.915
No water for you.

10:12.451 --> 10:15.887
You see for yourself--
there's videos online.

10:15.955 --> 10:18.890
Google "Ghouta, Syria."

10:22.762 --> 10:24.395
I wouldn't go that far,
Herr Adler.

10:24.463 --> 10:25.997
The case against her
is compelling

10:26.065 --> 10:27.532
on a number of fronts.

10:27.599 --> 10:29.099
I've heard the case.
Now tell me why we're here,

10:29.168 --> 10:30.234
what you want from us.

10:30.302 --> 10:32.203
We have an operational proposal.

10:32.271 --> 10:34.338
We need your help
to put it into effect.

10:34.406 --> 10:36.307
Naturally.

10:36.375 --> 10:38.809
The aim is to deliver
proof of her treason.

10:38.877 --> 10:41.779
Evidence that would stand up
in an American court of law.

10:41.846 --> 10:43.214
That's asking a lot.

10:43.282 --> 10:45.583
That would require
a full surveillance package.

10:45.651 --> 10:47.485
Car, apartment, drive-by teams.

10:47.553 --> 10:51.322
Correct. Ideally getting her
on tape, incriminating herself.

10:51.390 --> 10:54.024
Which means we'd also have to
plant something on her person.

10:54.092 --> 10:56.560
A mic in her handbag,
software on her phone.

10:56.627 --> 10:58.562
I can do that part.

10:58.629 --> 11:00.129
How the hell, Saul?

11:00.198 --> 11:02.832
I owe her a
visit anyway.

11:02.900 --> 11:04.568
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

11:04.635 --> 11:05.902
I'll make it unannounced.

11:05.969 --> 11:07.337
And all this without

11:07.405 --> 11:09.772
any consultation
or sanction from Langley?

11:09.840 --> 11:11.241
Neither of us is in a position

11:11.309 --> 11:13.176
to pitch anything
to our service.

11:13.244 --> 11:15.945
No kidding.
I believe you're the ones

11:16.013 --> 11:18.215
considered to be disloyal
at the moment.

11:18.282 --> 11:19.916
What's in
it for us, anyway?

11:19.983 --> 11:22.719
The last time we
stuck our necks out for you,

11:22.786 --> 11:24.721
it wasn't a happy ending.

11:24.788 --> 11:26.488
Fair enough.

11:26.556 --> 11:29.024
But if Allison Carr's
a Russian agent,

11:29.092 --> 11:31.527
you've got as much
to lose as we do.

11:31.595 --> 11:33.762
Arguably more.

11:36.766 --> 11:39.968
Okay. We're listening.

12:16.739 --> 12:18.406
Saul.

12:23.813 --> 12:25.713
Couldn't risk calling.

12:26.815 --> 12:28.650
What the hell's
going on?

12:29.918 --> 12:31.886
Everyone's furious at you.

12:31.953 --> 12:33.988
Including you?

12:34.055 --> 12:36.524
Including me.

12:36.592 --> 12:38.893
I take it you never
heard from Carrie.

12:38.960 --> 12:41.228
No, I never did.

12:41.297 --> 12:44.465
Are we ever gonna
get those documents back?

12:44.533 --> 12:45.900
I don't know.

12:45.967 --> 12:48.336
- Jesus, Saul.
- Here, sit down.

12:48.404 --> 12:50.338
I need to tell you something.

13:00.115 --> 13:02.783
I'm being offered
political asylum in Israel.

13:03.952 --> 13:05.986
That's not what I heard.

13:06.054 --> 13:08.289
I heard they want
nothing to do with you.

13:08.356 --> 13:10.057
Well, you heard wrong.

13:10.125 --> 13:12.426
You were scheduled
to be turned over to the FBI,

13:12.493 --> 13:14.561
and instead,
you made a run for it.

13:14.629 --> 13:17.531
No, Allison,
I'm here to say good-bye.

13:17.598 --> 13:20.301
I'm leaving for
Tel Aviv in the morning.

13:25.573 --> 13:29.176
I wanted to see you
before I went.

13:31.379 --> 13:33.981
You realize
how guilty this makes you look?

13:34.049 --> 13:37.718
What, you-you've secretly been
a Mossad agent all these years?

13:39.153 --> 13:40.787
No, you can't have been.

13:40.855 --> 13:42.121
It's too ridiculous.

13:42.189 --> 13:43.957
I told you,
Mossad had nothing to do

13:44.024 --> 13:45.659
with blowing up that plane.
It was the SVR.

13:45.727 --> 13:48.428
You keep saying, Saul,
but that doesn't make it true.

13:48.496 --> 13:51.264
Well, that's what Carrie's out
there trying to prove anyway.

13:56.203 --> 13:59.539
In any case...

13:59.607 --> 14:03.343
it's doubtful you and I
will see each other again.

14:06.013 --> 14:08.815
Now you're being melodramatic.

14:12.653 --> 14:15.355
Maybe so.

14:15.422 --> 14:18.091
I'm gonna miss you, Allison.

14:23.998 --> 14:26.465
I was asleep for ten years.

14:27.902 --> 14:30.069
You woke me up.

17:05.320 --> 17:07.589
Everything all right?

17:07.657 --> 17:10.291
Just needed a
drink of water.

17:11.561 --> 17:13.228
Go back to sleep.

17:13.296 --> 17:15.064
Mm-hmm.

17:55.437 --> 17:58.171
Polycarbonate.

17:58.239 --> 18:01.075
Ballistic glass.
I didn't touch anything.

18:01.142 --> 18:03.276
- I was just looking.
- Perfectly fine.

18:03.344 --> 18:05.345
You're Bibi's
cousin, right?

18:05.413 --> 18:06.981
Yes. Qasim.

18:07.048 --> 18:09.349
Dr. Aziz.

18:09.417 --> 18:13.621
They got everything right
except for the tubing.

18:13.688 --> 18:15.956
See this?

18:17.458 --> 18:19.426
The retracted length is
15 centimeters shorter

18:19.494 --> 18:21.193
than it needs to be.

18:21.261 --> 18:22.962
It's easy enough
to fix, though.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.967
You made this?

18:29.202 --> 18:31.070
It's my design.

18:31.138 --> 18:32.739
It's beautiful, huh?

18:32.806 --> 18:34.473
Yes.

18:34.541 --> 18:38.310
Although I have no idea
what it's meant to do.

18:38.378 --> 18:40.113
It's a testing chamber.

18:40.180 --> 18:43.349
It measures and records
the efficiency of the sarin.

18:43.416 --> 18:45.051
But you're not
releasing the gas

18:45.119 --> 18:46.285
while we're in
the building?

18:48.255 --> 18:50.356
The chamber is
double-sealed.

18:50.423 --> 18:52.924
A leak is highly unlikely.

18:52.992 --> 18:54.393
But not impossible.

18:54.461 --> 18:58.664
We'll each have
one of these, just in case.

18:59.866 --> 19:01.300
Atropine.

19:01.368 --> 19:04.735
It blocks the acetylcholine
in the nerve receptors, limits

19:04.803 --> 19:07.004
- the effects of the gas.
- Limits?

19:07.072 --> 19:09.674
I wouldn't worry.

19:09.741 --> 19:12.743
Why all these cameras?

19:12.811 --> 19:15.547
To record the effects
of the gas on our subject.

19:15.614 --> 19:17.415
Bibi was planning

19:17.483 --> 19:19.250
on abducting a
soldier or a Jew.

19:19.318 --> 19:23.020
<i>Al-hamdu lillah,</i> the
American was found instead.

19:26.458 --> 19:27.659
Back up a second.

19:27.726 --> 19:29.494
Where'd he make
the approach,

19:29.562 --> 19:31.128
this wannabe defector?

19:31.196 --> 19:32.897
At a trade conference
in Vienna.

19:32.964 --> 19:34.665
But we've been
doing the dance with him,

19:34.733 --> 19:37.568
on and off now,
for more than a year.

19:37.635 --> 19:39.269
Forgive me for not
following you, but, uh,

19:39.337 --> 19:41.172
is he defecting to you or to us?

19:41.239 --> 19:43.440
To you, <i>through</i> us.

19:43.508 --> 19:45.142
It's unorthodox,

19:45.210 --> 19:46.977
I know,
but not unheard of.

19:47.045 --> 19:50.280
So he's a consular official
in the Russian embassy there?

19:50.348 --> 19:51.982
No.

19:52.050 --> 19:53.417
- No?
- This is

19:53.484 --> 19:55.052
a senior Moscow Center chief

19:55.120 --> 19:57.521
with deep knowledge
of their agent networks

19:57.589 --> 19:59.489
in Germany,
Britain and Turkey.

19:59.557 --> 20:01.025
What's his name?

20:01.093 --> 20:03.360
- Calico.
- What's his real name?

20:03.428 --> 20:06.129
All in due course, Frau Carr.

20:06.197 --> 20:08.064
He's asking
not to be referenced

20:08.132 --> 20:10.100
in any kind of
electronic communication.

20:10.167 --> 20:12.369
Apparently, the SVR's broken

20:12.437 --> 20:13.870
some of our mutual
encryption codes.

20:13.938 --> 20:16.273
Huh. What are his terms?

20:16.341 --> 20:17.941
Five million dollars

20:18.008 --> 20:21.044
and asylum in the United
States under a new identity.

20:21.112 --> 20:24.981
He wants to live in
Boca Raton, of all places.

20:25.049 --> 20:27.618
The dollar amount
will prove difficult.

20:27.685 --> 20:29.786
He considers it
a minimum requirement,

20:29.854 --> 20:32.088
given the level
of his information.

20:32.156 --> 20:34.124
We have until
Friday to respond.

20:34.191 --> 20:36.760
If he doesn't hear from
us by then, he'll assume

20:36.827 --> 20:39.362
the deal is off, and he takes
his information elsewhere.

20:39.429 --> 20:42.998
There are some ground rules
we would insist on, as well,

20:43.066 --> 20:45.701
provided you're willing
to move forward, of course.

20:45.769 --> 20:49.438
Yeah. Reimbursement for
the cost of bringing him in,

20:49.506 --> 20:51.474
a finder's fee.
What else?

20:51.541 --> 20:53.175
The first crack at him.

20:53.243 --> 20:57.280
Seven days in a BND safe house
before we turn him over to you.

20:57.347 --> 20:59.014
Three days.

20:59.082 --> 21:01.651
And we get a full video
transcript of the debrief.

21:01.718 --> 21:03.552
Done.

21:03.620 --> 21:06.488
Good for you, Allison?

21:06.555 --> 21:08.390
Allison?

21:08.457 --> 21:11.959
Yeah, good for me.

21:16.064 --> 21:17.999
Excuse me.

22:04.239 --> 22:08.583
_

22:08.584 --> 22:12.695
_

22:12.720 --> 22:15.621
Are we tracing the number
she's texting?

22:15.689 --> 22:17.257
We are.

22:17.325 --> 22:19.025
_

22:19.847 --> 22:21.645
_

22:22.629 --> 22:24.930
_

22:26.656 --> 22:28.754
_

22:33.139 --> 22:35.588
_

22:35.742 --> 22:38.710
A code of some kind, maybe?

22:43.516 --> 22:45.584
If it is, it's a strange one.

23:38.904 --> 23:40.504
Ah.

23:40.572 --> 23:43.074
Thank you.

23:43.976 --> 23:46.444
I brought you some fruit.

23:46.511 --> 23:48.846
Grapes, dates, figs.

23:48.914 --> 23:50.315
Did you go online?

23:54.653 --> 23:57.788
Hard to watch, isn't it?

23:57.856 --> 24:00.390
Just ordinary
people, innocent.

24:00.459 --> 24:03.393
Like the ones you're
condemning to death here.

24:03.462 --> 24:04.929
Nobody's innocent.

24:04.996 --> 24:06.730
Not when you're
sending soldiers

24:06.798 --> 24:08.332
to slaughter Muslims
and occupy our lands.

24:08.399 --> 24:10.768
Your lands? You were born
and raised in Germany.

24:10.836 --> 24:13.504
This country has never been
my home, and never will be.

24:13.572 --> 24:15.372
And that justifies
burning it down?

24:15.440 --> 24:19.142
Terror is the necessary prologue
to a caliphate.

24:23.147 --> 24:25.048
If the West gives us
what we want,

24:25.116 --> 24:27.084
we won't have
to use the gas at all.

24:27.151 --> 24:29.919
- And what <i>do</i> you want?
- Assad out of Syria.

24:29.988 --> 24:32.422
And recognition by the UN
of the Islamic State.

24:32.490 --> 24:34.291
That will never happen.

24:44.268 --> 24:45.869
It might.

24:45.936 --> 24:48.438
After we send them a warning.

24:48.506 --> 24:49.906
What kind of warning?

24:52.309 --> 24:55.211
Proof of the weapon.

24:55.278 --> 24:57.746
A demonstration.

25:01.718 --> 25:05.254
Oh. So that's why
I'm still alive.

25:05.322 --> 25:08.457
That's what you're
building in the next room.

25:08.525 --> 25:10.226
Yes.

25:11.628 --> 25:14.030
Demonstration
will accomplish nothing.

25:14.097 --> 25:16.499
Your demands will not be met.

25:16.566 --> 25:17.933
Then the attack will go forward,

25:18.001 --> 25:19.668
and the blood will be
on their hands.

25:19.736 --> 25:21.803
No, Qasim.
The blood will be on your hands.

25:21.871 --> 25:24.907
The blood of women
and children.

25:24.974 --> 25:26.842
Whatever happens
is Allah's will.

25:26.910 --> 25:28.743
Maybe it's
Allah's will

25:28.810 --> 25:30.845
that you stop this.

25:38.921 --> 25:42.223
Even if I wanted to stop it,
how could I?

25:42.291 --> 25:44.492
I can't betray my brothers
to the police.

25:44.560 --> 25:45.993
I would never do that.

25:46.062 --> 25:48.563
Forget about the police.
Get rid of the DF.

25:48.630 --> 25:50.398
Without it,
Bibi can't make sarin.

25:50.466 --> 25:51.599
He'll know it was me.

25:51.667 --> 25:53.268
Then leave before
he finds out.

25:53.335 --> 25:57.372
Dump the DF into the ground,
walk away and don't look back.

26:08.516 --> 26:10.885
It's been almost
six hours.

26:13.755 --> 26:15.222
Maybe we missed it.

26:15.290 --> 26:17.625
Maybe the signal to her
handler was nonverbal.

26:17.693 --> 26:20.561
Maybe she's not
what you think she is.

26:21.997 --> 26:23.898
You're hoping against hope,
Saul.

26:23.966 --> 26:27.001
Fact is she's not running.

26:30.171 --> 26:32.039
Anything more
on her dinner date?

26:32.107 --> 26:34.774
Definitely a civilian.

26:34.842 --> 26:36.943
Though the hedge fund he
works for does do business

26:37.011 --> 26:40.147
with the Russian
oil and gas sector.

26:40.215 --> 26:41.548
What happened to you?

26:41.616 --> 26:44.351
Traffic was terrible.

26:44.419 --> 26:47.154
- What did you bring me?
- Amatriciana,

26:47.222 --> 26:52.159
arugula salad, and a torta
della nonna for dessert.

26:52.227 --> 26:54.894
- Yum.
- I know what you like.

26:57.932 --> 26:59.532
You told
her the defector

26:59.600 --> 27:00.800
was a high-ranking SVR chief?

27:00.868 --> 27:02.836
I did exactly
as we discussed.

27:02.903 --> 27:04.237
Yet here she
is, going about

27:04.304 --> 27:05.739
her business,
like it's another day

27:05.806 --> 27:06.806
at the fucking office.

27:06.874 --> 27:08.708
Literally.

27:08.776 --> 27:11.477
What do you mean?

27:19.586 --> 27:20.987
Saul?

27:26.760 --> 27:29.695
What's his problem?

27:29.763 --> 27:31.564
You don't know?

27:32.932 --> 27:34.733
Know what?

27:34.801 --> 27:38.003
He and Allison...

27:42.776 --> 27:45.244
Oh, Christ.

28:03.329 --> 28:04.429
Saul.

28:04.497 --> 28:06.165
Don't. Don't say a word.

28:07.734 --> 28:09.401
I just want to know if you think

28:09.468 --> 28:11.236
that she's onto us,
if this little performance

28:11.304 --> 28:12.838
that we're watching
is for our benefit.

28:12.906 --> 28:14.406
How the hell should I know?

28:14.473 --> 28:16.575
I don't know one goddamn thing
about her, apparently.

28:18.178 --> 28:20.378
You didn't give her a heads-up,
did you?

28:20.446 --> 28:21.546
What?

28:21.614 --> 28:23.015
A word in
her ear.

28:23.083 --> 28:25.250
One lover to another.

28:26.485 --> 28:27.952
I did not.

28:29.888 --> 28:32.190
I've been there, Saul,
as you well know.

28:32.258 --> 28:33.592
It's hard not to
be conflicted.

28:33.659 --> 28:36.528
I said no.

28:36.596 --> 28:38.062
Then we have a problem,

28:38.130 --> 28:40.232
because she's not taking
the bait.

28:41.500 --> 28:43.702
Or do you still believe
that she's innocent?

28:43.769 --> 28:46.571
I don't know what the fuck
to believe anymore.

28:50.142 --> 28:52.677
Well, the BND is not gonna
humor us much longer.

28:52.745 --> 28:55.614
If we don't drive her into the
arms of her handler and soon,

28:55.681 --> 28:57.815
all bets are off.

28:57.883 --> 28:59.817
Fine.

28:59.885 --> 29:02.152
We up the ante, then.

29:03.721 --> 29:05.155
Good.

29:05.223 --> 29:07.557
I'll go talk to Astrid,
and I'll get back to you

29:07.625 --> 29:08.759
with a game plan.

31:47.447 --> 31:49.748
Astrid's arriving at the cafe.

31:50.951 --> 31:53.119
Screen on.

31:55.255 --> 31:56.622
Closer, please.

31:56.689 --> 31:59.025
Thanks for meeting me
out of the office.

31:59.092 --> 32:01.193
No problem. What's going on?

32:01.261 --> 32:03.429
Didn't want to tell you
on the phone.

32:05.365 --> 32:08.667
This morning, Calico put
his wife and children on a plane

32:08.735 --> 32:11.537
to Tallinn, supposedly
to visit her relatives there.

32:11.604 --> 32:12.805
Why?

32:12.872 --> 32:16.074
He's insisting
we accelerate the timetable.

32:16.142 --> 32:19.044
But I thought the plan was
for next week. What happened?

32:19.111 --> 32:21.379
That's just it.
We're not exactly sure.

32:21.448 --> 32:22.981
What do you
think happened?

32:23.049 --> 32:24.750
Well, he's clearly spooked.

32:24.818 --> 32:27.352
And it appears to have something
to do with Berlin.

32:27.420 --> 32:29.354
He's refusing to do
the handover here.

32:29.422 --> 32:31.289
- The handover to us?
- Correct.

32:31.357 --> 32:34.224
Anywhere but Berlin,
he says.

32:34.292 --> 32:38.128
According to him, Berlin
Station's been penetrated.

32:38.196 --> 32:40.832
Wait a minute, does he mean me?

32:40.899 --> 32:43.133
- My station is?
- I'm afraid so.

32:43.201 --> 32:45.570
Human or electronic?

32:45.637 --> 32:46.571
He didn't say.

32:46.638 --> 32:49.340
But I thought you should know.

32:52.210 --> 32:54.479
I don't believe it.

32:54.546 --> 32:57.448
Now you can get out
in front of this, at least.

32:57.516 --> 32:59.717
Before your bosses find out.

32:59.785 --> 33:01.985
I would hope you'd do
the same for me one day.

33:02.052 --> 33:03.854
No. I mean, I don't believe it.

33:03.921 --> 33:07.223
He's making this shit up
to exaggerate his own value.

33:08.860 --> 33:12.328
I'm not sure
that would be smart on his part.

33:13.598 --> 33:16.065
Anyway, we'll know
soon enough.

33:16.133 --> 33:18.067
How do you figure?

33:18.135 --> 33:22.405
He's promised to provide us with
evidence of the penetration.

33:22.473 --> 33:26.809
That is, copies of actual
material passed to the SVR.

33:28.411 --> 33:31.179
- You'll let me know when that happens?
- Of course.

33:31.247 --> 33:33.015
When are you bringing him in?

33:33.082 --> 33:35.484
Tonight.
Across the Latvian border.

33:35.552 --> 33:38.420
He'll be at a safe house
in Hamburg by morning.

33:38.488 --> 33:40.155
Then we get him
three days later?

33:40.223 --> 33:41.790
Just not in Berlin.

33:41.858 --> 33:44.459
Just not in Berlin.

33:45.795 --> 33:47.095
Okay.

33:47.163 --> 33:48.964
You can't stay for lunch?

33:49.032 --> 33:50.698
I'm afraid not.

33:50.766 --> 33:53.801
I've been summoned to appear
before Joint Steering.

33:53.869 --> 33:56.203
What fun. Thank you, Astrid.

33:56.271 --> 33:59.240
Good luck. And I'm sorry.

34:09.317 --> 34:12.654
She's a very cool
customer, this one.

34:17.292 --> 34:18.891
Come on, baby.

34:18.960 --> 34:21.929
Time to move. Time to run.

34:39.580 --> 34:41.214
- Hello?
- Nina, it's me.

34:41.282 --> 34:42.581
When's the next InterCity
to Copenhagen?

34:42.649 --> 34:44.817
Hold on a second.

34:44.885 --> 34:47.120
2:26 PM.

34:47.188 --> 34:49.722
Book me a first-class ticket.
I'll pick it up at the station.

34:49.790 --> 34:51.157
What about
your afternoon meetings

34:51.225 --> 34:52.958
and the conference call
with London?

34:53.025 --> 34:55.728
- Reschedule them for next week.
- Will do.

34:56.862 --> 34:57.997
Get advance teams

34:58.065 --> 34:59.432
to the Hauptbahnhof
and somebody inside

34:59.500 --> 35:01.234
that first-class
compartment with her.

35:01.302 --> 35:02.502
Yes, sir.

35:13.580 --> 35:15.680
Shh!

35:25.658 --> 35:27.825
What the hell is that?

35:27.892 --> 35:29.460
That's a call code.

35:29.528 --> 35:31.629
We used them in Baghdad.
Two for this, three for that.

35:31.696 --> 35:34.064
Private and prearranged
between asset and base.

35:35.033 --> 35:36.334
She's on the move.

36:00.525 --> 36:03.360
Switch
to satellite.

36:19.777 --> 36:21.811
Make sure teams
all have contact.

36:21.879 --> 36:23.312
Her cell phone signal
just stopped sending.

36:23.380 --> 36:24.947
She's tearing it down.

36:25.015 --> 36:27.650
Exactly what I would be doing
right now, if I were her.

36:27.718 --> 36:29.251
What's the range
of the wireless transmitter

36:29.319 --> 36:30.519
I put in her purse?

36:30.587 --> 36:32.588
Unlimited.
It's a satellite unit.

36:33.523 --> 36:35.291
Better be.

36:35.358 --> 36:37.660
We just lost our backup.

36:44.568 --> 36:46.335
She's on her way
to Hauptbahnhof Station.

36:46.403 --> 36:48.571
Do we have a team
on the ground yet?

37:06.322 --> 37:07.689
Got her.

37:14.441 --> 37:15.881
_

37:15.990 --> 37:17.439
_

37:17.680 --> 37:19.499
_

37:49.897 --> 37:51.498
The ICE train is a feint.

37:51.566 --> 37:53.135
She's headed for the S-Bahn.

37:53.340 --> 37:55.968
- Alert drone surveillance.
- Yes, sir.

39:07.037 --> 39:08.938
What's happening? Where is she?

39:09.005 --> 39:11.974
At the Hauptbahnhof Station.
Platform 15. In full flight.

39:12.042 --> 39:15.411
16. She just crossed
the platform.

39:15.479 --> 39:19.248
- That's the train to
Potsdam Hauptbahnhof, right? - Right.

39:19.316 --> 39:22.585
Call Hauser at the BVG.
Ask him to delay the train

39:22.653 --> 39:24.620
down the line,
and see if you can get units

39:24.688 --> 39:26.288
waiting for her
at Nikolassee.

39:26.356 --> 39:27.789
Why Nikolassee?

39:27.858 --> 39:30.326
Because it's four stops
before Potsdam Hauptbahnhof,

39:30.393 --> 39:32.661
and there's a Russian safe house
there, apparently.

39:32.729 --> 39:34.063
- You hear that?
- I'm on it.

39:34.130 --> 39:38.234
Gates, dogs,
electronic security, the works.

39:38.301 --> 39:40.336
Drone is five out.

39:40.403 --> 39:42.404
<i>- Ja.</i>
<i>- Copy that.</i>

40:17.738 --> 40:19.206
Allison Carr.

40:19.274 --> 40:22.075
<i>Ja. Ja.</i>

40:22.143 --> 40:23.310
That was Adler.

40:23.378 --> 40:25.078
A warrant for Allison Carr
has just been approved.

40:25.146 --> 40:27.281
He wants you to make the call
when to execute it.

40:27.348 --> 40:29.482
Tell him I appreciate that.

40:29.550 --> 40:30.884
Man on the ground
knows best.

40:30.952 --> 40:32.286
Train.

40:52.772 --> 40:55.741
Drones on station.

41:37.148 --> 41:38.950
No need to maintain
visual contact.

41:39.017 --> 41:42.119
Drone's overhead,
plus we're tracking her on GPS.

42:39.176 --> 42:41.077
Have him take the drone up
another 2,000 feet,

42:41.145 --> 42:43.513
but stay on the other side
of the main road.

42:43.580 --> 42:45.881
Copy that.

42:54.358 --> 42:56.692
Wait a minute, we just lost
two screens-- what's going on?

42:56.760 --> 42:59.426
- GPS is down.
- Audio, too.

42:59.461 --> 43:00.929
She's about to go inside.
We need that audio.

43:00.996 --> 43:02.861
See if you can get the satellite
to reboot the transmitter.

43:02.862 --> 43:04.401
That's what I'm doing.

43:04.967 --> 43:07.302
Nothing.
It's gone dark.

43:07.370 --> 43:10.172
- Because it's not receiving a signal.
- Explain, please.

43:10.239 --> 43:12.240
She's saying it's a dead zone.
The entire compound.

43:12.308 --> 43:14.742
There must be jamming towers at
the perimeter of the property.

43:14.810 --> 43:16.010
What about a workaround?

43:16.079 --> 43:18.513
- I can try, but...
- Try now.

43:22.618 --> 43:23.785
Entering courtyard gate.

43:23.852 --> 43:25.453
She'll be inside
in less than a minute.

43:25.520 --> 43:27.755
Without ears on, we need to know
that's an SVR safe house,

43:27.823 --> 43:29.591
and we need to know it
conclusively.

43:29.658 --> 43:31.092
How the hell do we do that?

43:31.159 --> 43:33.094
What else could it be, Saul?
The security measures

43:33.161 --> 43:34.996
- are through the fucking roof.
- It's not good enough, Carrie.

43:35.064 --> 43:36.598
Well, what about her behavior?

43:36.665 --> 43:37.966
The call code,
destroying her cell,

43:38.033 --> 43:40.534
booking a fake trip
to Copenhagen.

43:40.603 --> 43:42.937
- We're gonna lose her, Saul.
- Look.

43:46.842 --> 43:48.909
Who's that?

43:48.977 --> 43:51.144
Enlarge the image.

43:53.347 --> 43:54.581
It's Ivan Krupin--

43:54.649 --> 43:56.883
SVR Berlin
Station Chief.

43:56.951 --> 43:59.552
Send in the arrest teams now.

44:06.260 --> 44:08.328
I'm burned.
You have to get me

44:08.395 --> 44:09.863
- out of Germany now.
- What do you mean, burn...

44:09.931 --> 44:11.098
You're not burned.

44:11.165 --> 44:12.365
Maybe not yet.
But I will be

44:12.433 --> 44:13.399
by tomorrow morning.

44:13.467 --> 44:14.400
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

44:14.468 --> 44:16.136
You're shaking.
Come on.

44:16.203 --> 44:18.871
It's okay.
Let's go. Go inside.

44:22.576 --> 44:24.677
Red Team standing by.

44:26.113 --> 44:28.781
Red Team standing by.

44:28.849 --> 44:31.151
One of your deputy chiefs

44:31.218 --> 44:33.952
is defecting across
the Latvian border tonight.

44:34.020 --> 44:36.655
He's promising to bring evidence
of a Russian mole

44:36.722 --> 44:37.856
inside
Berlin Station.

44:37.923 --> 44:39.291
What type of evidence?

44:39.359 --> 44:41.226
Material that I've passed to you
over the years.

44:41.294 --> 44:44.196
Actual classified material
that they will trace to me

44:44.264 --> 44:46.598
- in a heartbeat.
- That's impossible.

44:46.666 --> 44:48.600
Why impossible?

44:48.668 --> 44:50.202
Because it doesn't
work this way.

44:53.105 --> 44:55.174
Only two chiefs have
access to your material,

44:55.241 --> 44:57.176
or even knowledge
of your existence.

44:57.243 --> 44:59.178
Both of them
left last week

44:59.245 --> 45:01.680
for a fishing trip.
Kola Peninsula.

45:01.747 --> 45:03.080
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

45:03.148 --> 45:04.482
I was supposed
to go with them.

45:04.550 --> 45:07.485
Look, it must be some kind
of misunderstanding.

45:07.553 --> 45:09.320
- No, no.
- Or a stupid...

45:13.592 --> 45:15.092
Shit.

45:16.027 --> 45:17.562
You've been played.

45:18.664 --> 45:19.863
What?

45:20.899 --> 45:22.166
What the hell is that?

45:22.438 --> 45:24.315
_

45:24.495 --> 45:26.591
_

45:34.044 --> 45:36.779
- You led them here.
- No! I was not tailed.

45:36.847 --> 45:38.881
- I took every precaution.
- Obviously not.

45:40.084 --> 45:41.718
You have to get me out here.

45:41.785 --> 45:44.487
- Now.
- How? They're in the compound.

45:45.623 --> 45:47.090
Ivan, calm down, please.

45:48.326 --> 45:49.626
Calm down?

45:49.694 --> 45:52.395
Oh, I'm calm.

45:52.463 --> 45:54.063
I'm very calm.

45:54.131 --> 45:58.134
How the fuck could you be
so careless, huh? Unbelievable.

45:58.202 --> 46:00.837
Fall for this bullshit--
some fucking defector.

46:00.904 --> 46:03.572
Loo... Stop!

46:03.640 --> 46:05.141
Stop...

46:09.713 --> 46:11.214
Ivan.

46:13.283 --> 46:15.218
Stop.

46:16.987 --> 46:18.955
Think.

46:26.797 --> 46:28.930
What's the point?
It's over.

46:28.998 --> 46:31.599
I said think.

46:31.667 --> 46:33.635
We're done, Allison.

46:35.371 --> 46:37.305
We fucking lost.

46:37.373 --> 46:38.774
No, we have not.

46:38.841 --> 46:41.309
Now, listen to me
very carefully.

46:54.722 --> 46:55.990
Fan out.

47:08.236 --> 47:10.838
Knees! Knees!

47:20.815 --> 47:23.549
You're under arrest.

47:52.346 --> 47:54.347
Shut it down.

47:54.414 --> 47:56.281
Copy that, sir.
Drone is RTB.

48:13.131 --> 48:15.166
Well, that's quite a story.

48:15.234 --> 48:19.036
Talk about bringing
down the temple.

48:22.575 --> 48:24.842
Has the obvious benefit
of explaining a lot.

48:24.910 --> 48:26.310
A lot.

48:27.812 --> 48:30.381
I didn't want to believe it,
either, Dar.

48:30.448 --> 48:32.316
No, no, you
misunderstand--

48:32.384 --> 48:34.718
you've made your case.
Both of you.

48:34.786 --> 48:38.722
I just don't know who to
be more disgusted with.

48:38.790 --> 48:41.225
Her or us.

48:41.293 --> 48:43.594
Contract
cuts both ways.

48:43.661 --> 48:46.163
Always has.

48:48.166 --> 48:49.700
They just brought her in.

48:49.768 --> 48:51.468
She's in Interrogation 2.

49:22.065 --> 49:23.598
So?

49:23.666 --> 49:26.501
I don't want to be a cliché,
but do you mind telling me

49:26.569 --> 49:28.304
who's responsible
for this travesty?

49:28.371 --> 49:30.639
I imagine you are, Allison,

49:30.706 --> 49:31.640
in the end.

49:31.707 --> 49:34.143
I am?
Some fucking clown--

49:34.210 --> 49:35.677
and I sure hope
it wasn't you, Dar--

49:35.745 --> 49:38.380
just tore apart 12 years
of painstaking work.

49:38.448 --> 49:40.549
Well, I agree with you there.

49:40.616 --> 49:43.818
So... you want to start by
sharing some names with me.

49:43.885 --> 49:45.486
Names?

49:45.554 --> 49:47.922
Every one of Ivan
Krupin's active agents

49:47.990 --> 49:49.424
here in Europe and Britain.

49:49.491 --> 49:52.560
Ask him yourself.
He's in the next room, isn't he?

49:52.627 --> 49:55.229
I hardly think he'll talk to me.

49:55.297 --> 49:57.131
Of course he will.
You're forgetting--

49:57.199 --> 49:58.732
he's got diplomatic immunity.

49:58.800 --> 50:00.734
Immunity?
What are you talking about?

50:00.802 --> 50:03.171
No doubt the horse trading
with Moscow's

50:03.238 --> 50:05.206
- already begun.
- Dar,

50:05.274 --> 50:06.774
you can't just
send him back to Russia.

50:06.842 --> 50:09.077
They'll put him against
a wall and shoot him

50:09.144 --> 50:10.544
after what he's done
for us.

50:10.612 --> 50:12.480
- Done <i>for</i> us?
- Who do you think

50:12.547 --> 50:14.482
I've been getting my intel

50:14.549 --> 50:16.750
about troop escalation
in eastern Ukraine from?

50:16.818 --> 50:20.521
Or the Kremlin's plan
to interrupt international

50:20.589 --> 50:24.092
oil production?
It's been Ivan all along.

50:24.159 --> 50:26.194
Come on, Allison.
You're his agent,

50:26.261 --> 50:27.528
not the other way around.

50:27.596 --> 50:29.196
Otherwise,
why would you run today?

50:29.263 --> 50:31.765
Run? I wasn't running.

50:31.833 --> 50:34.502
You touched off
an instant-ignition call code,

50:34.569 --> 50:37.004
then crashed your cell
phone and took refuge

50:37.071 --> 50:39.139
at an SVR safe house.

50:39.207 --> 50:41.375
I was told by Astrid
this morning

50:41.442 --> 50:43.811
about a mole in my station.

50:43.879 --> 50:46.547
You can imagine my panic.
I feared for Ivan's safety.

50:46.615 --> 50:49.016
His very life
was at stake.

50:49.083 --> 50:51.752
My tradecraft was meant to fool
his people, not ours.

50:51.820 --> 50:54.121
Then explain what you were doing
at the safe house.

50:54.188 --> 50:56.089
I was bringing him in,
for God's sake.

50:56.157 --> 50:58.792
I have brought him in.

51:02.196 --> 51:05.966
He was my Joe
for 12 years, Dar.

51:08.136 --> 51:10.871
Surely you can understand that.

52:13.933 --> 52:15.366
Run.

52:26.545 --> 52:28.546
Maybe you will live.

52:28.615 --> 52:30.448
Let's go.
