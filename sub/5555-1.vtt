- Gun.

you brought a knife to a gun fight?

04:58.481 --> 04:59.414

05:39.320 --> 05:42.055
not my personal chef... what a relief.

05:42.089 --> 05:44.657
Uh, I'm sorry.
Y-y-your wife is having an affair

05:44.691 --> 05:46.393
with your brother and
you're happy about it?

05:46.427 --> 05:47.827
Hell, I got four other brothers,

05:47.861 --> 05:49.229
but my chef is one in a million.

06:05.211 --> 06:08.547
you have some explaining to do, but I think

06:08.581 --> 06:10.549
you have some explaining to do.

06:10.583 --> 06:13.452
Wait, did I forget to tell you
I've been working P.I. cases for you?

06:13.486 --> 06:14.719
Must have slipped your mind.

06:14.754 --> 06:16.521

I know, right?!

06:19.192 --> 06:20.463
But you're changing the subject.

06:54.559 --> 06:56.627
Why... why are you working my cases?

06:56.661 --> 06:58.295
Truth is, it's all your fault.

06:58.329 --> 07:00.898
You set up shop in my
office behind my back,

07:00.932 --> 07:02.861
- and it's my fault?
- Exactly.

07:02.881 --> 07:04.935
A month ago,
when you sent me here to open the place

07:04.970 --> 07:06.737
for your foreman,
a potential client came by.

07:06.771 --> 07:09.033
I was intrigued,
so I sort of said I was your associate,

07:09.053 --> 07:10.474
and then I kind of solved the case.

07:10.509 --> 07:12.235
Since then, I've closed three others.

07:12.255 --> 07:15.262
Alexis, you can't just...
you closed four cases?

07:15.282 --> 07:16.727
That's more than I have.

07:16.747 --> 07:18.501
I know. Step your game up.

07:18.521 --> 07:20.584
W-what about your college courses?

07:20.619 --> 07:21.985
Oh, please. I've got that handled.

07:22.020 --> 07:23.241
Plus, I forged your signature

07:23.261 --> 07:24.988
to make sure I got school
credit for being an intern.

07:25.023 --> 07:25.922

my profit participation in the company.

07:31.913 --> 07:34.064

- Uh, e-Esposito.

07:34.099 --> 07:36.233
How you doing, buddy?
How's the new boss lady treating you?

07:36.267 --> 07:37.134
She's ignoring me.

07:37.168 --> 07:38.668
Just like every other woman in his life.

07:38.703 --> 07:40.237
Shut up.

07:40.271 --> 07:42.472
So, your wife is not answering her cell,

07:42.506 --> 07:44.374
and we need her authorization
for more officers down here.

07:44.408 --> 07:45.575
Is she with you?

07:45.610 --> 07:47.910
Oh, I'm sorry. She's at a meeting at 1PP.
What's going on?

07:47.945 --> 07:49.846
We're working on a case. You interested?

07:49.880 --> 07:53.049
I'd love to, but I'm a little busy
with my thriving P.I. business.

07:53.083 --> 07:55.218
Not really. I closed all the cases.

07:55.253 --> 07:57.721
But since you're desperate,
I'll rearrange my hectic schedule...

07:57.755 --> 07:59.522
[Snorts]...and, uh,
lend you my expertise.

07:59.557 --> 08:01.712
[Beep] Come on.

08:04.362 --> 08:05.589
[Camera shutter clicking]

08:05.609 --> 08:07.330
Whoa!

08:07.365 --> 08:10.333
Looks like a Tarantino
film came to life in here.

08:10.368 --> 08:15.504
Yeah. Now meet our stars.
This is Greg Minoso.

08:15.538 --> 08:17.940
Over here, we got Jake Fitz.

08:18.295 --> 08:21.343
And finally, we come to Dustin Chambers.

08:21.378 --> 08:25.047
And check this out.
They were each packing identical .40 cals.

08:25.082 --> 08:26.749
I take it they weren't part
of the construction crew.

08:26.784 --> 08:29.051
No. Renovation's not scheduled
to begin till next week.

08:29.086 --> 08:31.254
Okay. So, what happened?

08:31.288 --> 08:32.955
Truth is, we're not sure yet.

08:32.990 --> 08:36.357
What we do know is that gunfire
was heard around 9:07 A.M.

08:36.392 --> 08:37.926
And continued for a minute or two.

08:37.960 --> 08:39.760
So they shot each other?

08:39.796 --> 08:41.763
Nope,
their wounds are from a downward angle,

08:41.798 --> 08:43.765
maybe 45 degrees, which means

08:43.799 --> 08:46.720
they probably all were shot from up there.

08:48.954 --> 08:52.240
Yep. The shooter was definitely up here.

08:52.275 --> 08:54.626
9 millimeter.

08:56.078 --> 08:56.912
All right.

08:56.946 --> 08:58.317
Must have capped them from up here,

08:58.337 --> 09:01.082
boom, boom, boom,
and then boogied out that exit.

09:01.117 --> 09:02.284
[Squish]

09:02.318 --> 09:04.351
Ew. Guys.

09:08.272 --> 09:09.656
Oh.

09:09.691 --> 09:12.326
Looks like our shooter took a bullet
from one of the dead guys down there,

09:12.360 --> 09:14.962
falls back up against the wall,
grabbing the drop cloth,

09:14.996 --> 09:16.030
pulling it down with him.

09:16.064 --> 09:20.134
Let's contact hospitals,
see if anybody came in...

09:21.969 --> 09:23.203
This is Beckett's.

09:24.472 --> 09:27.641
Wait. What did you just say?

09:27.675 --> 09:29.643
I gave it to her this morning.

09:59.336 --> 10:01.033
Tell me.

10:01.053 --> 10:03.862
Lanie said that blood
was a match to Beckett's.

10:04.208 --> 10:06.214
But there was so much blood.

10:06.673 --> 10:08.187
O-okay.

10:08.207 --> 10:11.196
Okay, but this is...
This is Beckett we're talking about.

10:11.216 --> 10:12.362
Yeah, yeah. She's as tough as they come.

10:12.382 --> 10:15.285
Exactly.
So, she must have shot those three guys.

10:15.320 --> 10:16.911
And since she hasn't contacted us,

10:16.931 --> 10:18.902
we can assume that their
partners abducted her.

10:18.922 --> 10:19.521
But why?

10:19.556 --> 10:21.490
We need to dig into the backgrounds
of those dead shooters.

10:21.510 --> 10:23.125
We need to find out who
they're working with.

10:23.160 --> 10:26.295
That's the thing. We can't.
Their I.D.s are all fake.

10:26.330 --> 10:27.784
And their prints aren't in the system.

10:27.804 --> 10:29.777
Castle,
do you have any idea what Beckett was doing

10:29.797 --> 10:30.532
at that theater?

10:30.567 --> 10:31.968
She was supposed to be at 1PP.

10:32.002 --> 10:33.455
I talked to Gates.

10:33.475 --> 10:36.472
Beckett didn't have anything on the books.

10:36.506 --> 10:37.706
So she lied to me?

10:37.741 --> 10:40.176
Guys, I got a hit on one of the
dead shooter's credit cards.

10:40.210 --> 10:42.778
He rented a short-term apartment
through an online site.

10:46.815 --> 10:49.317
NYPD!

10:58.339 --> 11:00.195
Ryan, I got dead space.

11:00.229 --> 11:01.462
Castle, stay put.

11:01.497 --> 11:03.216
NYPD!

11:13.241 --> 11:14.909
[Grunts]

11:15.155 --> 11:15.910
Wait!

11:15.944 --> 11:16.977
- Aah!
- Where is she?!

11:17.012 --> 11:18.312
[Grunts] Where's Beckett?

11:18.346 --> 11:19.346
[Grunts]

11:19.381 --> 11:20.867
Aah!

11:20.887 --> 11:23.483
[Guns cock] NYPD! don't move!
Get on the floor right now!

11:23.518 --> 11:25.352
- On the ground!
- On the floor right now!

11:25.387 --> 11:26.287
[Chuckles]

11:26.321 --> 11:28.155
[British accent] Have you seen the floor?

11:28.189 --> 11:30.690
If it's all the same to you,
boys, let's do the standing.

11:30.725 --> 11:32.270
[Castle coughing, wheezing]

11:37.899 --> 11:39.132
[Telephone ringing]

11:44.689 --> 11:46.039
Esposito: <i>Have a seat,</i> <i>Miss Shipton.</i>

11:46.073 --> 11:48.408
Oh, no, please, call my Hayley.

11:48.443 --> 11:51.244
I insist that anyone who's
frisked me use my given name.

11:51.278 --> 11:53.914
Okay, Hayley,
my partner and I really enjoyed

11:53.948 --> 11:54.981
reading your file.

11:55.015 --> 11:58.217
Oh, sweetie,
I'm so much more than words on paper.

11:58.252 --> 12:00.219
Born and raised in East London,

12:00.254 --> 12:02.088
over in the borough of Hackney.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.222
Rough area.

12:03.257 --> 12:05.624
Don't they have a street nicknamed
"the murder mile"?

12:05.659 --> 12:07.879
Well, yes. But it's not without its charms.

12:07.899 --> 12:10.262
Just like you.
Love your accent, by the way.

12:10.296 --> 12:11.196
Very posh.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.065
Where did you learn to speak like that?

12:13.099 --> 12:14.132
Not from the slums she grew up in.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.100
And definitely not from your mom,

12:15.134 --> 12:17.369
who's at the tail end
of a 20-year prison bid.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.738
Oh, then not wanting to
follow in mum's footsteps,

12:19.773 --> 12:22.307
you joined the metropolitan police service.

12:22.342 --> 12:23.805
- And that was an epic fail.
- Yeah, they booted you out

12:23.825 --> 12:25.744
because of your tendency
to cut legal corners.

12:25.779 --> 12:26.579
Allegedly.

12:26.613 --> 12:29.178
You hung a dealer out of a window
in order to get a confession?

12:29.198 --> 12:30.983
Did I hang him out the window?

12:31.017 --> 12:33.285
Or did I save him from
falling out said window?

12:33.319 --> 12:35.454
It's hard to tell.
It's even harder to prove.

12:35.489 --> 12:38.058
Well, lucky for us, we don't have to prove
that you were hiding in that apartment.

12:38.078 --> 12:40.092
Hiding? No. Lost.

12:40.126 --> 12:42.327
I was looking for a Starbucks, actually.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.215
Usually they're so easy to find.

12:44.235 --> 12:46.164
How do you know the guy
who rented that apartment?

12:46.199 --> 12:48.789
Unlike the imbeciles who
usually sit in this chair,

12:48.809 --> 12:51.336
I know my rights,
so I would like to leave now.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.771
No. I don't think so. [Thud]

12:53.806 --> 12:56.774
We got a missing NYPD captain,
as well as three dead bodies,

12:56.809 --> 12:58.176
so you should start talking right now.

12:58.211 --> 12:59.577
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I don't know anything...

12:59.612 --> 13:01.113
Hey, come on, Hayley.
You can do better than that.

13:01.147 --> 13:04.416
Look,
I am just a freelance security specialist.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.783
I was hired by an insurance
company to catch a hacker

13:06.818 --> 13:08.419
who's been stealing social-security numbers

13:08.453 --> 13:10.787
- from their system.
- Why were you in that apartment?

13:10.807 --> 13:13.257
I have been following fake I.D.s

13:13.291 --> 13:15.292
made from the stolen
social-security numbers.

13:15.327 --> 13:17.461
And last night,
I got an alert that five of them

13:17.496 --> 13:19.497
had been used together in New York City.

13:19.531 --> 13:21.665
Caught my attention,
so I flew in to investigate.

13:21.699 --> 13:24.335
Five I.D.s. You sure it was five?

13:24.369 --> 13:26.337
Four men and a woman.

13:26.371 --> 13:30.541
Greg Minoso, Jake Fitz,
Ty Dade, Dustin Chambers,

13:30.575 --> 13:31.842
and Susan Emory.

13:31.876 --> 13:33.511
Where were you at 9:00 A.M. this morning?

13:33.545 --> 13:34.878
On final approach to JFK,

13:34.913 --> 13:36.880
and my flight didn't land until 9:30.

13:36.915 --> 13:38.516
And that is all I know.

13:38.550 --> 13:40.317
Now go and check my alibi

13:40.352 --> 13:42.065
so that I can get the hell out of here.

13:47.391 --> 13:49.292
[Indistinct conversations]

13:54.098 --> 13:56.466
Thanks.

13:56.500 --> 13:57.667
She's hiding something.

13:57.701 --> 13:59.469
I know.

13:59.503 --> 14:01.310
We can't just let her leave.

14:01.330 --> 14:03.540
Her alibi is solid. We have to.

14:03.574 --> 14:04.541
Ryan.

14:04.575 --> 14:06.032
Yeah.

14:09.246 --> 14:12.404
Ugh. I put you down once.
I won't hesitate to do it again.

14:12.424 --> 14:16.218
My name is Richard Castle.
That missing captain is my wife.

14:16.437 --> 14:18.587
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

14:18.621 --> 14:20.780
Keep your sorry. Just give me your help.

14:20.800 --> 14:23.322
There's more to this story
than you're telling us.

14:23.342 --> 14:25.494
Now she's been injured and abducted.

14:25.528 --> 14:27.380
I don't know anything about that.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.566
Name your price.
Anything you say, I'll pay it.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.401
I just want my wife back.

14:32.435 --> 14:34.618
[Elevator bell dings]

14:34.638 --> 14:37.005
I hope you find her.

14:41.133 --> 14:44.360
Yo,
unis found a stolen van with blood in it

14:44.380 --> 14:46.060
by a dry-cleaner's on 23rd street.

14:46.080 --> 14:46.921
Any sign of Beckett?

14:46.941 --> 14:48.654
No. Officers found the owner
locked in the back.

14:48.674 --> 14:52.386
They said a woman matching
Beckett's description was there.

14:54.556 --> 14:56.091
Hi. I'm Detective Ryan.

14:56.125 --> 14:57.692
This is Detective Esposito.
This is Mr. Castle.

14:57.727 --> 14:59.527
Can you tell us what happened here?

14:59.561 --> 15:02.011
A lady and man burst in.
She said she was cop.

15:02.031 --> 15:03.865
Bleeding everywhere. Big mess.

15:03.899 --> 15:05.734
Those are her clothes.

15:05.768 --> 15:07.035
She told man to lock me in bathroom,

15:07.069 --> 15:09.027
he did, and that was it.

15:09.047 --> 15:11.505
Wait, <i>she</i> told him?

15:11.540 --> 15:13.307
You're saying that she was
here of her own volition?

15:13.342 --> 15:14.342
Not as a hostage?

15:14.376 --> 15:16.911
I was hostage. She was in charge.

15:17.333 --> 15:18.980
Yeah, it's her.

15:19.468 --> 15:20.982
Okay, this man that she was with,

15:21.016 --> 15:22.183
can you describe him?

15:22.218 --> 15:25.586
Uh... Late 20s, east Indian, had beard.

15:25.621 --> 15:27.221
Did you catch his name?

15:27.255 --> 15:30.224
No. But he was in kind of bad shape, too.

15:30.258 --> 15:33.160
Headaches, dizzy, said he needed to eat.

15:33.560 --> 15:36.029
She told him he probably
should have gotten breakfast

15:36.064 --> 15:38.398
instead of calling her.

15:38.745 --> 15:40.500
Beckett got a call from
some guy this morning.

15:40.534 --> 15:41.701
Do you know who she was talking to?

15:41.736 --> 15:43.497
She said it was a telemarketer.

15:46.004 --> 15:47.641
What is she doing?

15:49.803 --> 15:51.779
What the hell is going on?

15:57.179 --> 15:59.362
All right, let's think.

15:59.382 --> 16:00.882
Beckett gets a call from a mystery man.

16:00.916 --> 16:01.883
Can we trace the phone?

16:01.917 --> 16:04.319
Already checked.
Call came from a burner phone.

16:04.353 --> 16:06.687
Oh, damn it. All right.

16:06.722 --> 16:09.124
She must have met this guy at the theater.

16:09.158 --> 16:11.959
Clearly they were ambushed.
Beckett gets shot.

16:11.979 --> 16:13.694
But she manages to take three of them out,

16:13.729 --> 16:14.795
and then she and the man escape.

16:14.830 --> 16:16.197
But she didn't call for backup.

16:16.232 --> 16:18.232
Yeah. Why wouldn't she reach out to us?

16:18.266 --> 16:19.834
Guys, the woman just sewed herself up

16:19.868 --> 16:20.601
with a needle and thread.

16:20.636 --> 16:22.994
Clearly something's going on,
and she's afraid to contact anyone.

16:23.014 --> 16:24.605
But what? I me... I mean, what could it be

16:24.640 --> 16:26.240
that would cause her to react like this?

16:26.274 --> 16:28.242
Whatever it is, it has to do with this man.

16:28.276 --> 16:30.113
We find the man, we find Beckett.

16:30.145 --> 16:32.280
All right,
I'll have CSU dust this place for prints.

16:32.314 --> 16:34.148
- Maybe we get an I.D. on this guy.
- Right. [Cellphone rings]

16:34.182 --> 16:37.352

to sit with a sketch artist. [Beep]

16:40.389 --> 16:41.723
What's going on?

16:41.757 --> 16:43.358
Just hurry. And come alone.

16:43.392 --> 16:44.391
Right. [Beep]

16:44.425 --> 16:45.525
Uh, I'll...
I'll meet you back at the station.

16:45.560 --> 16:46.593
All right.

16:48.396 --> 16:49.529
Alexis?

16:49.564 --> 16:51.531
Alexis: Dad, we're in here.

16:51.566 --> 16:53.134
"We"?

16:53.168 --> 16:55.136
Beckett.

16:55.170 --> 16:56.737
Hayley: That's it. That is it. Yeah?

16:56.772 --> 16:58.372
Yes. Okay. What the hell's going on here?

16:58.406 --> 16:59.273
Oh, I hope you don't mind.

16:59.307 --> 17:00.374
I'm just giving her some P.I. lessons.

17:00.408 --> 17:03.144
Hayley was teaching me the
art of manipulating men.

17:03.178 --> 17:04.145
It's all about confidence and eye contact.

17:04.179 --> 17:06.546
Yeah,
if you can entice a man with your gaze,

17:06.580 --> 17:08.815
you can lie, steal, cheat, what have you.

17:08.848 --> 17:10.415
My wife is out there fighting for her life.

17:10.450 --> 17:12.152
Why are you wasting my time?

17:12.185 --> 17:14.553
Wait, what? Why didn't you tell me?

17:14.588 --> 17:15.789
Sorry. I figured it wasn't my place.

17:15.823 --> 17:19.425
Now, look, Rick. You asked for my help.
You want it or not?

17:19.459 --> 17:20.526
What's the catch?

17:20.560 --> 17:22.929
'Cause I'm thinking, with you,
there's always a catch.

17:22.963 --> 17:24.664
There's only one... no cops.

17:25.233 --> 17:27.300
- Why not?
- Differing agendas.

17:27.334 --> 17:28.501
The cops serve and protect the city.

17:28.535 --> 17:30.197
I serve and protect me.

17:31.935 --> 17:33.466
Fine. No cops.

17:33.652 --> 17:37.343
Dad. What happened to Beckett?

17:37.377 --> 17:39.278
She's hurt, and she's on the run?

17:39.312 --> 17:40.512
From whom?

17:40.546 --> 17:42.347
I don't know. It has something
to do with a man she's with.

17:42.381 --> 17:44.088
What man?

17:44.617 --> 17:47.585
Look, I'm here, aren't I?
You've got to give to get.

17:47.620 --> 17:49.424
Who's this mystery man?

17:50.119 --> 17:53.525
He's east Indian, in his late 20s.
He might be sick.

17:53.559 --> 17:56.761
He was dizzy, had a headache,
said he needed something to eat.

17:56.796 --> 17:59.164
I don't know. What about you, Hayley?

17:59.199 --> 18:00.933
I know you're holding back on something.

18:00.967 --> 18:03.869
I have a lead on the last two shooters.

18:03.903 --> 18:05.470
How?

18:05.504 --> 18:09.117
Well, I haven't just been
chasing random identities.

18:09.137 --> 18:12.109
A hacker stole 100,000
social-security numbers,

18:12.144 --> 18:14.111
then bundled them into smaller groupings.

18:14.146 --> 18:15.513
And who's he selling the bundles to?

18:15.548 --> 18:18.015
Mafia, drug cartels, terrorists.
Take your pick.

18:18.050 --> 18:20.018
However,
from the bundle of those five shooters,

18:20.038 --> 18:22.286
I've just uncovered that a
new identity's been used.

18:23.095 --> 18:24.322
Can you track it?

18:24.357 --> 18:25.423
I already have.

18:25.458 --> 18:28.274
It was used to lease a
storage locker a few days ago.

18:28.294 --> 18:30.262
And how does this help me find Beckett?

18:30.296 --> 18:33.865
It doesn't, but there are
still two killers hunting her.

18:33.899 --> 18:35.233
If we can track them down,

18:35.268 --> 18:36.868
I get one step closer to my hacker,

18:36.902 --> 18:38.670
and you get your wife out of harm's way.

18:38.704 --> 18:41.573
This way, we both get what we want.

18:42.159 --> 18:43.827
All right. Let's go.

18:43.847 --> 18:45.943
Alexis: Dad, did you notice any
candy wrappers or fruit juice,

18:45.977 --> 18:48.179
anything with sugar, at the dry-cleaner's?

18:48.213 --> 18:49.947
Uh, an empty soda can. Why?

18:49.981 --> 18:51.549
I think Beckett's mystery
man might have been having

18:51.583 --> 18:52.550
a diabetic incident.

18:52.584 --> 18:54.618
But based on his symptoms,
sugar is not enough.

18:54.652 --> 18:56.853
- You need Insulin to regulate...
- Honey, I need to go.

18:56.888 --> 18:59.049
Let's talk about this later, though, okay?

19:00.948 --> 19:03.727
Red, don't wait for the old man.
If you've got something, follow up on it.

19:03.761 --> 19:04.795
Look, Beckett's on the run.

19:04.829 --> 19:06.697
She can't go to a doctor,
can't go to a hospital,

19:06.731 --> 19:08.744
so how does she get her hands on Insulin?

19:08.764 --> 19:10.133
She would have to get creative.

19:10.167 --> 19:12.115
There you go.

19:18.170 --> 19:20.733
Why did we park back here?

19:20.753 --> 19:23.213
Hayley, we can just walk
straight through the front door.

19:23.247 --> 19:24.314
There's no bolt cutters required.

19:24.348 --> 19:27.283
Oh, you've been playing at
being a cop too long, Rick.

19:27.318 --> 19:30.120
As a P.I., you don't have a badge,
don't have search warrants.

19:30.154 --> 19:32.288
You've got to get creative, lie, cheat.

19:32.323 --> 19:34.123
And the occasional B&E, apparently?

19:34.157 --> 19:36.080
Yeah, if that's what it takes.

19:36.927 --> 19:38.624
So, what's it gonna be?

19:40.431 --> 19:42.798
Yeah.

19:42.833 --> 19:45.901
[Metal snaps]

20:01.042 --> 20:04.119
Hi. My name's Ale... Stryker.
Clara Stryker.

20:04.153 --> 20:06.688
I'm an auditor with emergency services.

20:06.722 --> 20:08.589
Um... What can I do for you, Ms. Stryker?

20:08.624 --> 20:10.158
I'm looking into a bogus 911 call

20:10.192 --> 20:12.794
made near a dry-cleaner's
on 2nd and 23rd street.

20:12.828 --> 20:15.697
Yeah. Uh, right.
We reported that as a prank.

20:15.731 --> 20:18.332
Then I'm sure you performed a
complete inventory afterward.

20:20.803 --> 20:22.804
I take it you didn't know you needed to?

20:23.460 --> 20:25.205
Don't worry. We can do it now.

20:25.239 --> 20:28.175
Look, Ms. Stryker,
I'm just a probationary E.M.T.

20:28.209 --> 20:30.177
My supervisor's gonna
be back any minute now.

20:30.211 --> 20:32.059
Can't this wait?

20:34.371 --> 20:37.484
Well, looks like everything's in its place.

20:37.518 --> 20:39.486
Where do you keep the Insulin?

20:39.520 --> 20:40.788
Uh...

20:40.822 --> 20:42.512
Shoot.

20:43.591 --> 20:45.188
We're missing two vials.

20:46.181 --> 20:47.661
Do you have a monitor for the camera?

20:47.993 --> 20:49.196
Yeah.

20:49.681 --> 20:51.678
Play back the time of the call.

20:59.540 --> 21:01.288
What the hell?

21:23.552 --> 21:24.230
Freeze it.

21:24.264 --> 21:25.297
[Click]

21:27.400 --> 21:28.901
[Camera shutter clicks]

21:28.936 --> 21:32.338
Ms. Stryker,
am I gonna get in trouble for this?

21:32.372 --> 21:34.406
We'll keep it our little secret.

21:34.441 --> 21:37.576
[Rattling]

21:38.209 --> 21:40.213
Who the hell are these people?

21:40.247 --> 21:44.050
Just look for anything that we
can use to track these guys.

21:47.776 --> 21:49.518
These are the same .40-calibers

21:49.538 --> 21:51.834
the shooters in the theater had.

21:55.262 --> 21:56.228
[Cellphone chimes]

21:56.263 --> 21:57.702
Who did you just text?

21:57.864 --> 22:00.432
The cops? We had a deal.

22:00.467 --> 22:01.233
You shook on it.

22:01.268 --> 22:02.901
If you wanted a binding agreement,

22:02.935 --> 22:04.102
we should have pinky-sweared.

22:04.137 --> 22:06.472
What are you, 4?

22:06.506 --> 22:08.073
[Clatter]

22:38.136 --> 22:39.270
[Grunts]

22:42.106 --> 22:43.640
Aah!

22:45.443 --> 22:47.477
[Both grunting]

23:02.545 --> 23:03.793
[Groans]

23:06.330 --> 23:07.863
[Rapid footsteps]

23:07.897 --> 23:09.031
- Hey. Whoa.
- Hey!

23:09.065 --> 23:10.032
[Sighs]

23:10.066 --> 23:11.834
Hayley, what happened?

23:11.868 --> 23:13.369
Ooh. I got my ass kicked.

23:13.403 --> 23:14.370
[Cellphone rings]

23:14.404 --> 23:16.472
- Oh.
- Yeah.

23:16.506 --> 23:17.740
[Beep] Hey. What's up?

23:17.774 --> 23:20.710
Dad, I was able to track Beckett
and that mystery man to a taxi.

23:20.744 --> 23:23.162
You are the best. Okay. Um...

23:23.182 --> 23:25.348
Now all we have to do
is call the cab company,

23:25.382 --> 23:26.716
figure out where they went.

23:26.750 --> 23:29.017
Already did. They went to a prison upstate.

23:29.052 --> 23:31.220
Really? Is she still there?

23:31.254 --> 23:34.657
No, but she visited an inmate...
William Bracken.

23:35.885 --> 23:37.226
Bracken?

23:37.260 --> 23:40.362
Okay, why is your wife visiting
a disgraced former senator?

23:41.259 --> 23:42.497
They have history.

23:42.531 --> 23:43.966
What kind of history?

23:44.000 --> 23:46.101
He had Beckett's mother killed.

23:46.909 --> 23:48.570
It's why she became a cop.

23:48.604 --> 23:51.173
She dedicated her life to hunting him.

23:51.207 --> 23:53.375
Okay, so, what's with the reunion?

23:53.409 --> 23:55.177
And why today of all days?

23:55.750 --> 23:57.545
Because Bracken's behind this.

23:57.580 --> 23:59.275
I know he was a powerful man,

23:59.295 --> 24:00.838
but that sort of influence dries up

24:00.858 --> 24:02.141
when you're serving life in prison.

24:02.161 --> 24:04.667
You don't know the kind of people
Bracken was aligned with...

24:04.687 --> 24:07.568
mercenaries, dealers,
the worst of the worst.

24:07.588 --> 24:09.724
He made a lot of people rich.

24:09.759 --> 24:12.806
A lot of whom may still owe him favors.

24:13.178 --> 24:16.913
You're saying that William Bracken ordered
a hit on your wife?

24:16.933 --> 24:21.569
Beckett ruined his socalled legacy,
his life.

24:21.604 --> 24:24.478
He's out for payback.

24:35.247 --> 24:37.189
You really think Bracken's behind this?

24:37.209 --> 24:38.464
The story tracks.

24:38.484 --> 24:40.051
Bracken is a megalomaniac

24:40.085 --> 24:41.653
who blames Beckett for ruining his life

24:41.687 --> 24:44.890
even though it was justice
for what he did to her mother.

24:46.060 --> 24:48.373
- You gonna be here when I come out?
- No.

24:48.393 --> 24:50.217
Because I texted Ryan and Esposito?

24:50.237 --> 24:51.329
I said no cops.

24:51.363 --> 24:52.730
You'd rather there be

24:52.764 --> 24:54.665
a storage locker full of guns out there?

24:54.699 --> 24:55.599
It's not my problem. [Scoffs]

24:55.634 --> 24:58.402
Look, Rick, if you want to be a real P.I.

24:58.436 --> 24:59.637
and not just play dress-up,

24:59.671 --> 25:01.739
you're gonna have to make some
changes in how you operate.

25:01.773 --> 25:03.407
Changes like lying to my friends?

25:03.441 --> 25:04.542
Yeah, sometimes.

25:04.576 --> 25:06.710
And sometimes you're even
gonna have to screw them over.

25:06.745 --> 25:08.245
Yeah. No, thanks.

25:08.279 --> 25:10.014
Look, nice guys don't just finish last

25:10.048 --> 25:11.181
in this business, Castle.

25:11.215 --> 25:13.383
They end up dead.

25:13.418 --> 25:15.185
I'll see you around.

25:15.219 --> 25:17.376
You really love her, don't you?

25:17.972 --> 25:19.970
Like a house on fire.

25:20.218 --> 25:22.026
Must be nice.

25:24.128 --> 25:25.696
[Beep] Speed dial 5.

25:25.730 --> 25:27.398
[Ringing]

25:29.234 --> 25:30.418
- Woman: Go.
- It's me.

25:30.438 --> 25:31.268
What do you need?

25:31.302 --> 25:34.271
Tell the lab I'm coming in with
something for them to test.

25:34.620 --> 25:36.929
Gonna need it I.D.'d right away.

25:47.885 --> 25:48.851
[Buzzer]

25:48.886 --> 25:51.054
[Door opens]

25:51.367 --> 25:53.256
No. No, no, no, no.

25:53.291 --> 25:54.724
Forget it. I got nothing to say to you.

25:54.758 --> 25:56.426
Oh, tough.

25:56.461 --> 25:58.395
I know Beckett was here, and I know why.

25:58.429 --> 26:00.654
So you're gonna call
off your dogs right now.

26:00.674 --> 26:01.597
Or what?

26:01.617 --> 26:03.399
Are you gonna write
something mean about me?

26:03.433 --> 26:05.201
Or I'm gonna start a
scholarship in your name

26:05.235 --> 26:07.403
and offer it to the
children of the first inmate

26:07.437 --> 26:09.205
who shanks you in the prison laundry.

26:09.239 --> 26:10.206
You'll be wasting your money.

26:10.240 --> 26:12.108
Oh, forgive me if I don't
take your word for it.

26:12.142 --> 26:13.910
[Buzzer in distance]

26:13.944 --> 26:15.336
[Laughs]

26:16.466 --> 26:18.170
What's so funny?

26:18.853 --> 26:20.549
You.

26:21.583 --> 26:25.955
You come in here all on
fire about your wife.

26:26.125 --> 26:28.958
You don't even know who she is.

26:28.993 --> 26:31.560
16 years, Kate Beckett's been obsessed

26:31.595 --> 26:33.329
with solving her mother's murder.

26:33.363 --> 26:36.618
You really think she can turn
off that kind of obsession?

26:38.101 --> 26:39.835
Are you saying this is <i>her</i> fault?

26:39.869 --> 26:44.239
I'm saying she's never gonna be
happy just being Mrs. Castle.

26:44.273 --> 26:46.574
She needs to tilt at windmills.

26:46.609 --> 26:50.012
It's in her DNA, like a moth to the flame.

26:50.812 --> 26:54.249
And we all know what happens
to the moth in the end.

26:56.052 --> 26:58.086
[Tap]

27:02.447 --> 27:05.326
Let me out of here. [Buzzer]

27:07.563 --> 27:11.997
Hey. Storage unit was
rented with a stolen I.D.

27:12.017 --> 27:13.467
Who do we know who's been chasing those?

27:13.501 --> 27:14.601
Hayley Shipton.

27:14.636 --> 27:17.138
She must have a list of all
stolen I.D.s in that bundle.

27:17.172 --> 27:18.305
Used it to track our shooters here.

27:18.339 --> 27:20.775
And to convince Castle to
run with her instead of us.

27:20.809 --> 27:22.862
- What the hell's he thinking?
- He's not.

27:22.882 --> 27:25.546
He's reacting,
trying whatever he can to find Beckett.

27:25.580 --> 27:27.174
It's gonna get him killed.

27:27.849 --> 27:29.684
Look at all this stuff.
It's all next-gen weaponry.

27:29.718 --> 27:32.019
Piston-driven,
tricked out with thermal scopes,

27:32.054 --> 27:34.021
- sound suppressors.
- Probably some kind of

27:34.056 --> 27:35.389
professional hit squad or something.

27:35.423 --> 27:36.791
Yeah, but who's paying them?

27:36.825 --> 27:38.492
And how do they connect to Beckett?

27:38.526 --> 27:39.526
[Cellphone chimes]

27:40.357 --> 27:41.250
[Beep]

27:41.270 --> 27:43.564
I.D. sketch from the
drycleaner's came back.

27:43.598 --> 27:45.365
The guy running with Beckett.

27:45.400 --> 27:46.967
Let's priority-one this through the system

27:47.002 --> 27:49.312
and hope that an I.D. on this
guy gets us some clarity.

27:55.236 --> 27:57.511
[Gun cocks] Keep walking.
Head for the blue van.

27:57.545 --> 27:59.546
Oh, just the person I was looking for.

27:59.581 --> 28:01.348
You know, most people react differently

28:01.382 --> 28:02.449
to a gun in their side.

28:02.483 --> 28:04.651
Yeah, well,
this sort of thing happens to me a lot.

28:05.817 --> 28:07.854
So, I was just in there
visiting with your boss.

28:07.888 --> 28:10.524
I don't know how much he's paying you,
but it can't be worth your life.

28:10.558 --> 28:13.326
You really have no idea what's going on,
do you?

28:13.360 --> 28:15.494
So enlighten me.

28:15.529 --> 28:17.083
Not my job.

28:17.103 --> 28:18.664
Open it.

28:20.934 --> 28:22.501
Oh!

28:22.536 --> 28:23.869
[Groaning]

28:27.541 --> 28:28.907
[Cellphone clatters]

[Glass shatters]

28:30.577 --> 28:32.077
Sleep well.

28:32.112 --> 28:33.946
Dad's missing! We have to find him!

28:33.980 --> 28:35.848
Whoa, whoa. Whoa. Slow down.

28:35.882 --> 28:36.840
What are you... what are you talking about?

28:36.860 --> 28:38.180
I've been tracking his
cellphone on the sly.

28:38.200 --> 28:39.731
That way, if he ever disappeared again,
I'd know.

28:39.751 --> 28:41.519
And an hour ago,
his phone suddenly went dead.

28:41.554 --> 28:42.721
Okay, maybe the battery just died.

28:42.756 --> 28:44.123
No. Not with where he went.

28:44.157 --> 28:45.257
And where's that?

28:45.291 --> 28:47.525
Winterkill correctional.
I tracked Beckett there earlier.

28:47.560 --> 28:49.527
Winterkill. That's where Bracken is.

28:49.562 --> 28:51.897
He's connected to this somehow.
That's why dad went to see him.

28:51.931 --> 28:54.480
Without telling us.
But I bet Hayley went along, huh?

28:54.500 --> 28:55.333
Yeah, but when I called her,

28:55.368 --> 28:56.735
she said she left him at the prison.

28:56.770 --> 28:57.636
Hasn't heard from him since.

28:57.670 --> 29:00.089
All right, I'll reach out to the prison,
get their external surveillance feed.

29:00.109 --> 29:01.863
All right. Where are you going?

29:01.883 --> 29:03.613
To get Hayley.

29:05.648 --> 29:09.049
You can quit faking.
The dose I gave you wore off by now.

29:09.069 --> 29:10.582
Well, you can't blame a guy for trying.

29:10.616 --> 29:12.283
You might want to try something
a little more original

29:12.317 --> 29:15.007
than the trick Derrick Storm pulled in
"Stormfall."

29:15.329 --> 29:17.689
- You read my books?
- Lot of downtime in my line of work.

29:17.723 --> 29:19.156
Your earlier stuff was better.

29:19.191 --> 29:21.025
You got soft once you met the skirt.

29:21.059 --> 29:22.949
- Everyone's a critic.
- Sit.

29:28.359 --> 29:29.367
Ouch!

29:29.401 --> 29:31.335
Ah.

29:31.370 --> 29:33.638
[Gasping]

29:33.972 --> 29:37.475
Can't help but think
you've done this before.

29:41.843 --> 29:46.116
Hey. Richard Castle.
I'd shake hands, but...

29:46.150 --> 29:47.951
- You think this is funny?
- No. No, no.

29:47.986 --> 29:50.353
I just felt like you'd be serious enough

29:50.388 --> 29:51.454
for the both of us.

29:51.489 --> 29:53.223
Well, how's this for serious?

29:53.257 --> 29:54.858
You either tell me where your wife is...

29:54.893 --> 29:57.073
[Gun cocks] or I'm gonna kill you.

30:02.505 --> 30:04.294
This is a simple question.

30:04.803 --> 30:07.556
- Where's Kate Beckett?
- I don't know.

30:07.576 --> 30:10.411
And even if I did know,
I wouldn't tell you.

30:10.446 --> 30:11.346
[Chuckles]

30:11.380 --> 30:13.045
You know, it's amazing. They all say that.

30:13.065 --> 30:15.477
And yet they all end up talking in the end.

30:15.497 --> 30:16.644
You know, since we're asking questions,

30:16.664 --> 30:18.989
maybe you guys could fill
in a few blanks for me.

30:19.009 --> 30:23.276
For example, if Bracken isn't your boss,
then who is?

30:23.296 --> 30:25.360
You know what,
I don't think he's taking this seriously.

30:25.394 --> 30:28.009
Maybe a little pain will help him focus.

30:28.029 --> 30:29.264
Pass. But you know what?

30:29.298 --> 30:31.433
I would kill for a nice
cappuccino right now,

30:31.467 --> 30:32.854
extra froth.

30:33.450 --> 30:35.202
You expect us to believe that your wife

30:35.236 --> 30:37.681
is keeping you in the dark?

30:38.364 --> 30:40.875
Look, this isn't working.
How do you want to do this?

30:40.909 --> 30:42.543
Start by cutting off his
fingers until he talks

30:42.578 --> 30:43.878
or jump straight for
the wedding vegetables?

30:43.912 --> 30:45.479
You know, actually,
I was thinking something

30:45.513 --> 30:49.383
maybe a little more, uh, psychological.

30:59.943 --> 31:02.897
I'm gonna be honest with you.
That doesn't look that scary.

31:02.931 --> 31:05.199
Well, why don't you look again?

31:11.672 --> 31:12.906
[Gasps]

31:12.940 --> 31:14.540
Okay, I might puke.

31:15.509 --> 31:17.043
[Whimpers]

31:22.817 --> 31:24.651
Where is she, Castle?

31:24.685 --> 31:25.685
I don't know.

31:25.720 --> 31:28.287
Hmm?

31:28.322 --> 31:30.123
[Cries]

31:30.157 --> 31:31.290
Where is she?

31:32.107 --> 31:34.105
I don't know! [Grunts]

31:36.363 --> 31:38.131
[Grunts] Where is she?

31:38.165 --> 31:39.165
I don't know anything.

31:39.199 --> 31:41.534
The last time I saw Castle
was outside the prison.

31:41.568 --> 31:43.670
You'd think an ex-cop would understand
obstruction of justice.

31:43.704 --> 31:45.639
Yeah, especially since arresting her for it

31:45.673 --> 31:47.640
will torpedo her investigator's license.

31:47.674 --> 31:49.108
You're not scaring me, guys.

31:49.142 --> 31:50.709
You think we're playing?

31:50.744 --> 31:52.176
Castle's one of us, which means you better

31:52.196 --> 31:54.447
come clean right now,
or every cop in this city

31:54.467 --> 31:56.181
is gonna make it their
mission to jam you up.

31:56.215 --> 31:57.783
I understand the passion.

31:57.817 --> 31:59.785
But I have a reputation to uphold.

31:59.819 --> 32:02.420
My clients think that I roll over
every time a cop says "boo,"

32:02.455 --> 32:04.222
I'm looking for a new line of work.

32:04.257 --> 32:05.457
Damn it, my dad's in trouble!

32:05.491 --> 32:08.100
If you know anything about where he is,
you have to tell us.

32:08.361 --> 32:10.954
Alexis, it's not that simple.

32:10.974 --> 32:12.497
Yes, it is.

32:14.503 --> 32:16.268
Please. [Sniffles]

32:19.505 --> 32:22.124
Okay, there is something I kept to myself,

32:22.144 --> 32:23.675
but it's not gonna help you.

32:23.709 --> 32:24.542
It's a dead end.

32:24.576 --> 32:26.544
Spill.

32:26.578 --> 32:28.512
There was a woman at the storage locker.

32:28.547 --> 32:29.647
We mixed it up a little.

32:29.682 --> 32:32.750
When she kicked me,
something transferred from her boot.

32:32.785 --> 32:35.019
I had a lab test it. It's creosote.

32:35.054 --> 32:38.723
It's a form of coal tar
primarily used to treat railway ties.

32:38.757 --> 32:41.659
There are tens of thousands of
those ties used in the subway.

32:41.694 --> 32:43.494
You get a copy of the lab report?

32:43.528 --> 32:44.978
Yeah.

32:48.633 --> 32:49.667
No, tie's not from the subway.

32:49.702 --> 32:50.802
- What?
- How do you know?

32:50.836 --> 32:53.004
No traces of any steel dust
or any other pollutants.

32:53.038 --> 32:54.572
My guess is that the rail road tie's new.

32:54.606 --> 32:57.452
I'll call MTA.
See where they store those things.

33:00.357 --> 33:02.112
Thank you.

33:03.050 --> 33:04.973
Brooks: Where is she?

33:07.554 --> 33:08.952
Where's your wife, Castle?

33:08.986 --> 33:10.588
I don't know! I swear!

33:12.422 --> 33:14.892
That is the wrong answer.

33:18.129 --> 33:20.097
[Spiders squirming]

33:22.667 --> 33:25.397
[Grunting]

33:25.417 --> 33:27.643
Tell me where your wife is.

33:28.005 --> 33:29.906
Tell me where she is.

33:29.941 --> 33:32.408
[Muffled screaming]

33:32.443 --> 33:34.554
- Where is she?
- I don't know!

33:34.574 --> 33:36.946
Come on, Castle.
No woman is worth dying for.

33:36.980 --> 33:40.116
Come on. Where is she?!

33:40.150 --> 33:41.917
[Screams]

33:50.661 --> 33:51.994
[Grunts]

33:52.028 --> 33:52.962
[Gasps]

33:53.327 --> 33:55.798
I believe that you're telling the truth.
I do.

33:55.832 --> 33:56.932
I believe that you're telling me the truth.

33:56.967 --> 33:59.402
But unfortunately,
that means it's time for you to die.

33:59.436 --> 34:00.822
Sorry about that.

34:03.106 --> 34:04.674
[Grunts]

34:13.215 --> 34:15.250
[Gunshots]

34:17.387 --> 34:21.422
[Muffled footsteps]

34:40.742 --> 34:41.842
Hey.

34:53.056 --> 34:54.822
Lights out.

34:54.856 --> 34:56.223
[Gunshots]

34:56.257 --> 34:57.658
Aah!

34:57.693 --> 34:59.327
[Gunfire]

35:15.509 --> 35:16.876
[Gun clatters]

35:19.524 --> 35:22.602
Castle. Are you okay?

35:22.813 --> 35:25.485
Where have you been?
Why haven't you called?

35:26.275 --> 35:27.821
I couldn't.

35:28.381 --> 35:30.570
Kate, what's going on?

35:30.590 --> 35:32.625
I...

35:33.816 --> 35:35.372
[Sirens wail in distance]

35:35.392 --> 35:36.495
I've got to go.

35:36.529 --> 35:38.006
No, no! No, Kate...
Kate, why are you shutting me out?

35:38.026 --> 35:40.366
Castle, I love you.

35:42.969 --> 35:44.434
Kate. Kate.

35:44.454 --> 35:45.904
Kate.

35:45.938 --> 35:47.740
Kate.

35:47.774 --> 35:49.207
[Grunts]

35:55.021 --> 35:57.715
Castle! Hey, man, you okay?

35:57.750 --> 35:59.409
Beckett... she was here. She was here!

35:59.429 --> 36:01.452
What? Where?

36:01.487 --> 36:03.121
[Indistinct shouting]

36:03.554 --> 36:04.923
Alexis: Dad!

36:06.825 --> 36:09.761
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. I'm okay. I'm okay.

36:09.795 --> 36:11.462
It's okay.

36:11.654 --> 36:14.266
Man: No sign of Katherine Beckett, sir.

36:18.637 --> 36:21.110
E.S.U. says the building is secure.

36:21.130 --> 36:22.922
There's no sign of Beckett.

36:31.553 --> 36:33.335
Why doesn't Beckett trust me?

36:33.472 --> 36:35.011
She does.

36:35.031 --> 36:36.791
Then why is she keeping me in the dark?

36:36.825 --> 36:38.907
- I don't need protecting.
- Yes, you do.

36:38.927 --> 36:41.195
You're a writer, dad.

36:41.229 --> 36:43.394
And you and Beckett are magic together.

36:43.414 --> 36:46.918
But you don't have her
training or her skill set.

36:47.998 --> 36:50.104
When you disappeared last year...

36:52.497 --> 36:57.078
I thought you were dead for two months.

36:57.112 --> 37:00.380
And then you went missing today,
and I was so scared.

37:01.023 --> 37:04.184
- Honey...
- Beckett has a reason for keeping quiet.

37:04.632 --> 37:08.322
If you love her, you have to trust her.

37:08.356 --> 37:09.489
[Door opens]

37:10.571 --> 37:13.028
Finally. What are we waiting for?
Let's go give her hell.

37:13.048 --> 37:13.865
Castle, wait.

37:13.885 --> 37:16.292
We got a positive I.D.
on the guy running with Beckett.

37:16.312 --> 37:17.434
Great. Who is he?

37:17.454 --> 37:19.010
His name is Vikram Singh.

37:19.030 --> 37:20.234
He's a low-level analyst

37:20.268 --> 37:22.517
for the Attorney General's
investigative office.

37:22.537 --> 37:24.018
In D.C.?

37:24.038 --> 37:27.274
- That's where Beckett worked.
- Yeah, but that was two years ago,

37:27.309 --> 37:28.745
and she never mentioned
anyone named Vikram.

37:28.765 --> 37:30.477
Yeah, as far as we can tell,
their paths never crossed.

37:30.511 --> 37:32.026
He's only been on the job a few months.

37:32.046 --> 37:34.514
Then how would Beckett know him?

37:34.549 --> 37:37.016
We need to call Rachel McCord.
She was Beckett's partner.

37:37.051 --> 37:38.819
McCord's dead, Castle.

37:38.853 --> 37:41.154
Killed yesterday in an automobile accident,

37:41.188 --> 37:42.884
along with three other members of her team.

37:44.415 --> 37:45.826
That can't be a coincidence.

37:45.860 --> 37:46.893
It's not.

37:46.927 --> 37:48.662
The last member of her
team was stabbed to death

37:48.696 --> 37:50.252
at a club that same night.

37:50.272 --> 37:53.467
Witnesses saw him flirting
with a hot brunette.

37:53.501 --> 37:55.709
This doesn't make any sense.

37:55.729 --> 37:57.563
What does any of this
have to do with Bracken?

37:57.583 --> 37:59.531
Well, let's go ask her.

38:02.956 --> 38:04.644
For someone who says they've
got a lot of downtime,

38:04.679 --> 38:06.458
you sure have been a busy girl.

38:06.478 --> 38:09.453
Staging car accidents, stabbings in D.C.,

38:09.473 --> 38:12.051
kidnapping me at gunpoint in New York.

38:12.086 --> 38:14.387
Tell me,
do assassins get frequent-flier miles?

38:14.421 --> 38:16.389
Ryan: Ah,
but you didn't fly commercial, did you?

38:16.423 --> 38:18.391
We ran your photo against
every flight from D.C.

38:18.425 --> 38:21.218
So you either road-tripped
it or you took a private jet.

38:21.238 --> 38:22.661
And given your arsenal,

38:22.696 --> 38:25.031
you people clearly have the resources.

38:26.231 --> 38:28.415
I'm not really sure what
you're expecting here.

38:28.435 --> 38:32.438
A tearful confession? Not gonna happen.

38:32.472 --> 38:35.041
Well, we are expecting that
you're smart enough to know

38:35.075 --> 38:37.062
that it's C.Y.A. time.

38:37.082 --> 38:43.049
Look, unless you've got a bag of spiders,
we're done here.

38:44.098 --> 38:47.053
You know, you told me I had
no idea what was going on,

38:47.087 --> 38:48.621
and you were right.

38:48.655 --> 38:50.056
But now I've got the edge of it,

38:50.090 --> 38:51.624
and I'm gonna keep on peeling it back

38:51.658 --> 38:55.428
until I know everything,
with or without your help.

38:55.462 --> 38:58.263
I'll recommend the "with."
It comes with less prison time.

38:58.298 --> 38:59.464
[Scoffs]

38:59.498 --> 39:02.667
Prison's a picnic compared to
what happens to me if I talk.

39:04.404 --> 39:05.938
You need to make your
peace with the fact that

39:05.972 --> 39:07.705
your wife isn't long for this world.

39:07.740 --> 39:11.476
Don't be so sure.
Your team started out with five.

39:11.510 --> 39:13.412
Three of you are dead,
and you're sitting right here.

39:13.446 --> 39:15.480
That leaves one... your boss.

39:15.514 --> 39:18.783
And Beckett against one guy?
I like those odds.

39:21.354 --> 39:24.389
What makes you think there's
only one team in play?

39:27.460 --> 39:29.782
[Sighs]

39:35.435 --> 39:38.036
[Tires screech]

39:51.771 --> 39:53.584
All right.

39:58.075 --> 39:59.190
Esposito: Hey.

39:59.224 --> 40:01.497
I just got off the phone with
an assistant A.G. In D.C.,

40:01.517 --> 40:03.060
an Allison Hyde.

40:03.095 --> 40:04.828
She's leading the investigation
in the deaths of her people.

40:04.863 --> 40:06.464
She's up on the first plane in the morning

40:06.498 --> 40:08.260
to take our hitter into federal custody.

40:08.280 --> 40:11.267
Does she have any idea of
this Vikram guy's connection to Beckett?

40:11.302 --> 40:13.544
No, but she's pulling his records.

40:13.564 --> 40:15.165
So, we're nowhere.

40:27.418 --> 40:28.885
- Gun!
- Man: Gun! Gun!

40:28.919 --> 40:30.553
Everybody, get down!

40:30.587 --> 40:32.187
Look out!

40:45.667 --> 40:47.563
- I'm gonna do something.
- Don't be stupid.

40:47.583 --> 40:49.710
Where's the fun in that?

40:58.947 --> 41:01.121
Shooter's down!
[Police radio chatter]

41:01.141 --> 41:03.651
- Are you okay?
- Alexis: Yeah.

41:03.685 --> 41:05.671
[Indistinct shouting] Come on.

41:05.691 --> 41:08.189
L.T. Stay down.

41:08.223 --> 41:09.990
Man: We got two officers down.

41:10.025 --> 41:11.992
Hurry up!

41:12.027 --> 41:14.395
- Oh, sweetie, don't look.
- Why did she do it?

41:14.430 --> 41:16.157
There's no way she
thought she could escape.

41:16.177 --> 41:18.229
It wasn't about escape.

41:18.249 --> 41:20.167
She knew her fate was sealed
as soon as she got caught.

41:20.187 --> 41:22.502
That's why she went out on her own terms.

41:22.537 --> 41:24.585
And made sure we stay in the dark.

41:28.276 --> 41:31.244
Damn it, Kate. Where are you?
