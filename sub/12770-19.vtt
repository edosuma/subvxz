00:03.291 --> 00:05.083
♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:08.125 --> 00:10.709
(Addison) I'LL NEVER FORGET
THE FIRST TIME

00:10.750 --> 00:14.083
IN INTRODUCED MYSELF
AS DR. ADDISON MONTGOMERY.

00:14.125 --> 00:17.041
I WAS A RESIDENT IN NEW YORK,
AND I GOT PAGED TO THE E.R.

00:17.083 --> 00:19.041
I WAS PREPARED FOR ANYTHING--

00:19.083 --> 00:21.792
EMERGENCY C-SECTION,
BREECH BABY, ECTOPIC PREGNANCY--

00:21.834 --> 00:24.333
BUT IT WAS JUST
A ROUTINE DELIVERY.

00:24.375 --> 00:26.208
WOMAN'S THIRD KID.

00:26.250 --> 00:28.625
SHE PUSHED, SHE SCREAMED,
SHE HELD HER DAUGHTER.

00:28.667 --> 00:32.041
BUT... SOMETHING CHANGED IN ME

00:32.083 --> 00:36.458
WHEN I HEARD THAT WOMAN
CALL ME "DR. MONTGOMERY."

00:36.500 --> 00:38.959
I FELT LIKE A SUPERHERO

00:39.000 --> 00:41.208
WHO HAD TAKEN ON
ANOTHER IDENTITY.

00:41.250 --> 00:44.166
HONESTLY, I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D FEEL THAT WAY AGAIN...

00:44.208 --> 00:46.250
UNTIL TODAY.

00:46.291 --> 00:48.667
I WAS SITTING ON THE BEACH
IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE,

00:48.709 --> 00:50.834
AND THIS LITTLE GIRL
NAMED JUNE

00:50.875 --> 00:54.667
CAME OVER TO SEE
WHAT WAS INSIDE THE BASKET.

00:54.709 --> 00:57.041
I TOLD HER

00:57.083 --> 00:59.041
HIS NAME WAS HENRY.

00:59.083 --> 01:01.500
AND THEN SHE ASKED
WHO I WAS.

01:01.542 --> 01:05.333
AND I SAID,
"I AM HENRY'S MOM."

01:06.959 --> 01:07.959
(laughs)

01:14.083 --> 01:15.458
ARE YOU READY?

01:15.500 --> 01:16.875
I GUESS SO.

01:16.917 --> 01:18.041
OKAY. JUST RELAX.

01:18.083 --> 01:20.041
WE'RE GONNA SEE SOMETHING
IN A SECOND.

01:20.083 --> 01:22.875
DO YOU WANNA KNOW
IF IT'S A BOY OR A GIRL?

01:22.917 --> 01:24.250
I NEED TO KNOW EVERYTHING.

01:24.291 --> 01:26.000
OKAY.

01:29.750 --> 01:32.750
(ultrasound whooshing)

01:34.000 --> 01:36.417
OH, MY GOD.

01:36.458 --> 01:38.083
THERE IT IS.

01:38.125 --> 01:40.208
THERE...

01:40.250 --> 01:41.834
HE IS.

01:41.875 --> 01:43.041
(laughs)

01:43.083 --> 01:45.125
OH. (laughs)

01:45.166 --> 01:48.583
OH, HE'S BEAUTIFUL.

01:51.333 --> 01:53.458
ADDISON?

01:55.083 --> 01:56.625
ADDISON?

01:56.667 --> 01:58.750
ADDISON.

01:58.792 --> 02:01.000
ADDISON?!

02:02.750 --> 02:04.709
(indistinct conversations)

02:04.750 --> 02:07.709
YOUR MIGRAINES ARE THE RESULT
OF VASCULAR SPASM.

02:07.750 --> 02:09.667
YOU SHOULD GET SOME RELIEF
WITH THE SUMATRIPTAN.

02:09.709 --> 02:11.291
SO THERE'S NO WAY
IT'S A TUMOR?

02:11.333 --> 02:12.792
YOU'RE SURE?

02:12.834 --> 02:14.041
I'M SURE.

02:14.083 --> 02:16.500
(sighs and laughs)
OH, THANK YOU.

02:16.542 --> 02:18.709
AND I'M SORRY FOR BEING
SO SELF-INVOLVED.

02:18.750 --> 02:21.792
WHEN ARE YOU DUE?

02:21.834 --> 02:23.458
A FEW MONTHS.

02:23.500 --> 02:25.125
OH, IT MUST BE
SO EXCITING.

02:25.166 --> 02:29.125
(laughs) I CAN'T WAIT
TO HAVE ONE OF MY OWN.

02:29.166 --> 02:30.583
YOU'RE CARRYING HIGH.

02:30.625 --> 02:32.041
I THINK THAT MEANS
YOU'RE HAVING A BOY.

02:32.083 --> 02:33.250
DO YOU KNOW?

02:33.291 --> 02:34.500
I HAVE ANOTHER PATIENT.

02:34.542 --> 02:36.625
OH, SURE. GOOD LUCK.

02:36.667 --> 02:37.834
YOU DOIN' ALL RIGHT?

02:37.875 --> 02:39.041
(elevator bell dings)

02:39.083 --> 02:40.083
I'M GREAT.

02:40.125 --> 02:42.208
(Henry fusses)

02:42.250 --> 02:43.208
(gasps)

02:43.250 --> 02:44.333
(laughs)

02:44.375 --> 02:47.000
(Violet)
HELLO, MR. HENRY. (laughs)

02:49.125 --> 02:51.333
I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT
WITH COOPER.

02:55.083 --> 02:56.709
GIVE ME THAT BABY.

02:56.750 --> 02:58.041
(laughs)

02:58.083 --> 02:59.208
(Charlotte) HELLO.

02:59.250 --> 03:01.166
I'VE GOTTA ADMIT,
THAT LITTLE RUG RAT'S

03:01.208 --> 03:02.583
PRETTY CUTE.
RIGHT?

03:02.625 --> 03:05.041
I SWEAR, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
TO FEEL BAD ABOUT ANYTHING

03:05.083 --> 03:06.208
WHEN I'M AROUND HIM.

03:06.250 --> 03:08.166
I JUST WISH I COULD
SHARE IT WITH AMELIA, BUT--

03:08.208 --> 03:10.125
HEY. WELCOME BACK, ADDISON.

03:10.166 --> 03:11.750
THANK YOU.
I-I'M NOT "BACK" BACK.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.041
I'M JUST VISITING.

03:13.083 --> 03:14.667
HEY, THERE'S THE LITTLE MAN.

03:14.709 --> 03:16.041
YOU, UH, YOU MIND
IF I HOLD HIM?

03:16.083 --> 03:17.750
SURE. OH, OH, OH, OH.

03:17.792 --> 03:19.125
DID YOU, UH,
GET THE BASKET I SENT?

03:19.166 --> 03:20.834
YES, THANK YOU.

03:20.875 --> 03:22.583
I WOULD'VE COME OVER SOONER,
BUT, YOU KNOW,

03:22.625 --> 03:24.458
WE DOCTORS ARE CARRIERS
OF ALL SORTS OF VIRUSES, RIGHT?
(baby-talk voice) OH, NO

03:24.500 --> 03:26.041
OF COURSE.
(deepened voice)
COME HERE, YOU.

03:26.083 --> 03:28.041
UH, IS THIS...
BREAST MILK.

03:28.083 --> 03:29.458
OKAY. FROM?

03:29.500 --> 03:30.875
FROM THE MILK BANK, SAM.

03:30.917 --> 03:32.250
IT'S NOT LIKE I WAS
TROLLING THE STREETS

03:32.291 --> 03:34.041
LOOKING FOR LACTATING--

03:34.083 --> 03:35.875
JUST--
JUST DON'T TOUCH IT, OKAY?

03:35.917 --> 03:37.375
OKAY.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

03:37.417 --> 03:39.750
SO AMELIA FIRED ME AS HER O.B.,
AND SHE'S NOT SPEAKING TO ME.

03:39.792 --> 03:41.000
IS SHE TALKING TO ANYBODY?

03:41.041 --> 03:42.375
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE'VE ALL TRIED.

03:42.417 --> 03:44.083
BUT I THINK SHE NEEDS
HER SPACE RIGHT NOW.

03:44.125 --> 03:46.083
WHEN SHE'S READY,
SHE'LL REACH OUT.

03:46.125 --> 03:48.291
(baby-talk voice)
NOW I HAVE TO GO BACK TO WORK.

03:48.333 --> 03:52.709
BUT YOU COME SEE AUNTIE VI
BEFORE YOU GO, OKAY? (laughs)

03:52.750 --> 03:54.667
IS SHE GETTING
ANY PRENATAL CARE?

03:54.709 --> 03:56.041
YOU KNOW, I TRIED
TO BRING THAT UP,

03:56.083 --> 03:57.667
BUT SHE BASICALLY TOLD ME
TO BACK OFF.

03:57.709 --> 03:59.500
I DON'T WANT
TO SOUND INSENSITIVE,

03:59.542 --> 04:01.041
BUT ARE THERE ANY SIGNS
THAT SHE'S USING AGAIN?

04:01.083 --> 04:02.875
MNH-MNH. I'VE BEEN WATCHING.
SHE SEEMS CLEAN.

04:02.917 --> 04:04.041
YEAH, SHE'S LIVING
IN MY HOME.

04:04.083 --> 04:05.208
I THINK I WOULD KNOW
IF SHE WERE.

04:05.250 --> 04:06.625
WELL, IT'S TOO BAD
SHELDON'S NOT AROUND.

04:06.667 --> 04:07.834
MAYBE SHE'D TALK TO HIM.

04:07.875 --> 04:09.041
HAS ANYBODY HEARD
FROM SHELDON?

04:09.083 --> 04:11.041
OH, WE GOT A POSTCARD
FROM HIM. HE'S IN ARUBA.

04:11.083 --> 04:12.208
ARUBA? (laughs)
ARUBA?

04:12.250 --> 04:13.709
WHAT'S HE DOING THERE?

04:13.750 --> 04:16.333
(Charlotte) APPARENTLY HIS
EX-WIFE LEFT A GUY AT THE ALTAR,

04:16.375 --> 04:18.041
BUT THE HONEYMOON
WAS PAID FOR.

04:18.083 --> 04:20.041
SO HE IS HER PLUS ONE.

04:20.083 --> 04:21.208
(Sam laughs)
OH.

04:21.250 --> 04:24.041
IT'S NICE TO HAVE
A PLUS ONE.

04:24.083 --> 04:25.125
(knocks on doorjamb)

04:25.166 --> 04:27.458
SO, UH, MASON...

04:27.500 --> 04:29.041
WET OUR BED THIS MORNING.

04:29.083 --> 04:30.959
PLEASE NO LECTURES.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.083
I'M NOT READY TO FORCE HIM
TO SLEEP IN HIS OWN ROOM YET.

04:33.125 --> 04:35.041
WHEN DO YOU THINK
YOU WILL BE?

04:35.083 --> 04:36.542
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT HE WON'T EVEN SPEAK.

04:36.583 --> 04:38.041
SO THE IDEA OF EXILING HIM
TO HIS OWN ROOM--

04:38.083 --> 04:40.041
WELL, DON'T THINK OF IT
AS EXILING.

04:40.083 --> 04:42.041
THINK OF IT AS NOT
GIVING HIM SPECIAL TREATMENT

04:42.083 --> 04:43.041
FOR UNWANTED BEHAVIOR.

04:43.083 --> 04:44.542
IT'S LIKE I SAID

04:44.583 --> 04:46.041
WHEN HE FIRST
STOPPED SPEAKING,

04:46.083 --> 04:47.333
Y-YOU CAN'T FORCE HIM
TO TALK,

04:47.375 --> 04:49.000
BUT HE HAS TO ASK
FOR WHAT HE WANTS.

04:49.041 --> 04:50.375
YOU KNOW, TREAT HIM WITH
RESPECT. DON'T INDULGE HIM.

04:50.417 --> 04:51.709
HE MAY BE A KID,

04:51.750 --> 04:53.041
BUT HE'S A VERY SMART KID.

04:53.083 --> 04:55.041
WELL, IT FEELS LIKE
HE'S NOT A KID ANYMORE.

04:55.083 --> 04:57.041
IT FEELS LIKE THE MOMENT
HIS MOTHER DIED,

04:57.083 --> 04:59.041
HIS CHILDHOOD WAS OVER.
IT WAS DONE.

04:59.083 --> 05:00.959
HE CRIES IN HIS SLEEP
EVERY NIGHT.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.583
MY SON IS IN A KIND OF PAIN
THAT I'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED,

05:03.625 --> 05:06.041
AND THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

05:06.083 --> 05:08.041
WELL, YOU'RE IN MOURNING,
TOO, COOPER--

05:08.083 --> 05:11.041
FOR ERICA, FOR THE LOSS
OF MASON'S INNOCENCE,

05:11.083 --> 05:13.583
FOR THE TOLL THAT IT'S
TAKEN ON YOU AND CHARLOTTE.

05:13.625 --> 05:15.166
JUST...

05:15.208 --> 05:17.166
DON'T LET
MASON'S REGRESSION DEEPEN,

05:17.208 --> 05:19.250
BECAUSE ONCE KIDS START
DISAPPEARING INTO THEMSELVES...

05:19.291 --> 05:23.041
OKAY.
I WON'T PUSH HIM ON SPEAKING.

05:23.083 --> 05:25.959
AND I WILL...

05:26.000 --> 05:28.417
DEHYDRATE HIM EVERY NIGHT
BEFORE HE GOES TO SLEEP?

05:28.458 --> 05:30.041
(laughs) YOU'RE GONNA GET
THOSE WATERPROOF MATTRESS COVERS

05:30.083 --> 05:31.291
AND YOU'RE GONNA PUT IT
ON THE BED.

05:31.333 --> 05:32.709
AND YOU'RE GONNA PUT HIM
IN THAT BED,

05:32.750 --> 05:34.792
WEARING THOSE PAJAMAS
THAT RING A LITTLE ALARM

05:34.834 --> 05:37.041
WHEN THE KID PEES
TO WAKE HIM UP.

05:37.083 --> 05:38.834
AND THEN HE'LL START
SPEAKING AGAIN?

05:38.875 --> 05:40.500
HANG IN THERE, COOP.

05:40.542 --> 05:43.041
IT'S GONNA GET BETTER.

05:43.083 --> 05:45.041
LOOK AT THOSE FINGERS.

05:45.083 --> 05:46.917
OH.

05:46.959 --> 05:48.041
HEY.
(Sam) HEY, MAN.

05:48.083 --> 05:49.083
HEY, YOURSELF.

05:49.125 --> 05:50.291
I WAS--I WAS GONNA HEAD DOWN
TO THE PROMENADE

05:50.333 --> 05:51.500
AND GRAB A COFFEE.

05:51.542 --> 05:53.709
YOU WANNA--YOU WANNA
TAKE HENRY FOR A-A WALK?

05:53.750 --> 05:56.333
OH, NO, THANKS. NO.

05:56.375 --> 05:59.041
WE ARE JUST PERFECT

05:59.083 --> 06:00.208
RIGHT WHERE WE ARE.

06:00.250 --> 06:01.875
HUH?

06:01.917 --> 06:03.417
(laughs)

06:03.458 --> 06:04.625
SEE YOU LATER.
OH.

06:04.667 --> 06:06.625
ALL RIGHT, MAN.
HI, LITTLE BOY.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.667
(man) WHAT FIRST ATTRACTED YOU
TO EACH OTHER?

06:08.709 --> 06:10.125
I--
OH, THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

06:10.166 --> 06:12.875
YEAH, IF WE DISCUSS WHAT
FIRST DREW US TO EACH OTHER,

06:12.917 --> 06:14.875
THAT'LL REINFORCE
OUR CONNECTION.

06:14.917 --> 06:18.041
VIOLET, YOU--YOU ARE
OBVIOUSLY A VERY...

06:18.083 --> 06:20.583
TALENTED THERAPIST.

06:20.625 --> 06:22.458
BUT IN THIS ROOM,
YOU'RE A PATIENT.

06:22.500 --> 06:23.875
(laughs) YOU'RE RIGHT.
RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT.

06:23.917 --> 06:26.583
I'M--I'M SORRY.

06:26.625 --> 06:28.583
SO...

06:28.625 --> 06:29.917
PETE?

06:29.959 --> 06:31.709
WELL...

06:31.750 --> 06:33.041
VIOLET IS A FIGHTER.

06:33.083 --> 06:34.291
THE WAY SHE FIGHTS
FOR HER PATIENTS,

06:34.333 --> 06:35.709
HOW PASSIONATE SHE IS,

06:35.750 --> 06:37.291
IT WAS--IT WAS HOT.
(laughs)

06:37.333 --> 06:38.709
IT WAS HOT?

06:38.750 --> 06:40.583
NO, I MEAN, IT STILL IS.

06:40.625 --> 06:42.000
IT--BUT...

06:42.041 --> 06:44.166
WE HAD A LOT OF FUN

06:44.208 --> 06:45.500
AT THE BEGINNING.

06:45.542 --> 06:47.291
(laughs) WE DID.

06:49.959 --> 06:51.500
AND NOW?

06:55.750 --> 06:57.041
UH...

06:57.083 --> 06:59.041
WE'RE HERE TO...

06:59.083 --> 07:00.458
PUT OUR FAMILY BACK TOGETHER,

07:00.500 --> 07:02.542
TO--TO GET OUR RELATIONSHIP
BACK TO THE WAY IT WAS

07:02.583 --> 07:03.959
AT THE BEGINNING.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.250
I MEAN, WE'RE AWARE THAT
WE CAN'T GO BACK, BUT...

07:07.709 --> 07:08.875
PETE.

07:08.917 --> 07:10.041
YEAH.

07:10.083 --> 07:11.500
YOU LOOK UPSET.

07:11.542 --> 07:12.917
I'M NOT UPSET.

07:12.959 --> 07:15.083
WHEN VIOLET...
CORRECTED YOU JUST NOW,

07:15.125 --> 07:17.041
YOU LOOKED UPSET.

07:17.083 --> 07:18.834
I-I DIDN'T CORRECT HIM,
DID I?

07:18.875 --> 07:20.208
DID I CORRECT YOU?

07:20.250 --> 07:22.041
I DIDN'T NOTICE.

07:22.083 --> 07:24.750
YOU KNOW, FOR TWO PEOPLE
CONSIDERING DIVORCE,

07:24.792 --> 07:27.875
THIS HAS BEEN
A-AN AWFULLY POLITE SESSION.

07:27.917 --> 07:29.500
YEAH, WE'RE NOT
CONSIDERING DIVORCE

07:29.542 --> 07:32.208
SO MUCH AS WE'RE
CONSIDERING RECONCILIATION.

07:32.250 --> 07:35.917
A-AND SINCE WHEN IS
BEING POLITE A BAD THING?

07:37.208 --> 07:39.041
(Violet) WELL,
WE TRIED DR. PERKINS,

07:39.083 --> 07:40.792
BUT YOU SAID
HE WAS TOO INTENSE.

07:40.834 --> 07:42.166
THEN WE WENT WITH YOUR CHOICE,
WHO WASN'T EVEN REALLY A DOCTOR.

07:42.208 --> 07:43.583
OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE
IS REAL MEDICINE.

07:43.625 --> 07:45.000
HE WAS A REAL PSYCHIATRIST,
VIOLET.

07:45.041 --> 07:46.041
WE AGREED
ON WHITEHOUSE.

07:46.083 --> 07:47.375
CAN WE PLEASE
JUST GIVE HIM A SHOT?

07:47.417 --> 07:48.792
(man) DR. WILDER!

07:48.834 --> 07:50.000
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

07:50.041 --> 07:51.041
DREA SPENCER,
9-YEAR-OLD FEMALE

07:51.083 --> 07:52.375
FOUND WITH
MULTIPLE STAB WOUNDS.

07:52.417 --> 07:53.709
SHE'S HYPOTENSIVE.

07:53.750 --> 07:54.917
OKAY, LET'S GET HER
INTO BAY ONE.

07:54.959 --> 07:56.041
CROSSMATCH HER TIMES FOUR.

07:56.083 --> 07:57.333
TRAUMA PANEL--
CHEST AND ABDOMEN.

07:57.375 --> 07:58.917
THAT'S MY SISTER!
YOU HAVE TO SAVE HER!

07:58.959 --> 08:00.166
WHAT'S YOUR NAME, SWEETIE?
MISSY.

08:00.208 --> 08:01.333
MISSY, YOU SHOULD NOT
BE IN HERE.

08:01.375 --> 08:02.959
NO, NO, NO, I NEED
TO SEE MY SISTER.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.500
ALL RIGHT, I GOT A PAGE
ABOUT A STAB VICTIM.

08:04.542 --> 08:06.083
YEAH, WE GOTTA GET A HANDLE
ON THIS BLEEDING.

08:06.125 --> 08:07.917
ALL RIGHT, I'LL GET
THE CENTRAL LINE STARTED.

08:07.959 --> 08:09.750
I TOLD HER I JUST NEEDED
AN EXTRA HALF-HOUR

08:09.792 --> 08:11.125
TO FINISH MY ALGEBRA AND THEN
WE WERE GONNA MAKE CUPCAKES,

08:11.166 --> 08:13.750
BUT WHEN I WENT IN TO GET HER,
SHE WASN'T IN HER ROOM.

08:13.792 --> 08:16.041
AND I KEPT YELLING HER NAME
AND LOOKING FOR HER.

08:16.083 --> 08:17.417
AND THEN I-I HEARD THE SIRENS

08:17.458 --> 08:19.417
AND--AND THEN THE CARS CAME
AND STOPPED AT THE HOUSE.

08:19.458 --> 08:21.041
MISSY,
WE SHOULD WAIT OUTSIDE.

08:21.083 --> 08:22.959
I DIDN'T KNOW SHE LEFT
THE HOUSE!
(monitor beeping erratically)

08:23.000 --> 08:24.333
(Pete) WE LOST HER PULSE.
HELP HER, PLEASE!

08:24.375 --> 08:25.542
I NEED A THORACOTOMY TRAY.

08:25.583 --> 08:27.041
OH! OH, MY BABY.

08:27.083 --> 08:28.959
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT HAPPENED?

08:29.000 --> 08:30.291
YOUR DAUGHTER IS SUFFERING
FROM MULTIPLE STAB WOUNDS,

08:30.333 --> 08:31.917
INCLUDING ONE TO THE HEART.

08:31.959 --> 08:33.500
WE NEED TO GET HER TO SURGERY
TO REPAIR IT RIGHT NOW.

08:33.542 --> 08:35.917
WE NEED TO STEM THE BLOOD FLOW.
SHE'S ABOUT TO BLEED OUT.

08:35.959 --> 08:37.041
OKAY, JUST DO
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

08:37.083 --> 08:38.083
(woman)
PLEASE, YOU GOTTA HELP HER.

08:38.125 --> 08:39.291
VIOLET.
PLEASE.

08:39.333 --> 08:40.917
EVERYBODY OUT. NOW.
IT'S OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

08:40.959 --> 08:43.041
LET'S GO.

08:43.083 --> 08:44.875
(rib spreader clicking)
MISSY.

08:44.917 --> 08:47.166
(beeping continues)

08:47.208 --> 08:48.583
MISSY.

08:48.625 --> 08:51.792
COME ON. IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

08:51.834 --> 08:53.834
(beeping continues)

08:56.709 --> 08:58.041
HEY, UM...

08:58.083 --> 09:01.125
I ACTUALLY THINK WE DON'T
HAVE TIME FOR THIS NOW SO I--

09:01.166 --> 09:02.458
MM.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.875
OKAY, MAYBE WE DO.

09:06.166 --> 09:07.834
(laughs)

09:07.875 --> 09:09.333
(sighs)

09:09.375 --> 09:11.041
WHAT DID VIOLET SAY
ABOUT MASON AND THE PEEING?

09:11.083 --> 09:12.125
YOUR PILLOW TALK
NEEDS A LITTLE HELP.

09:12.166 --> 09:14.125
(laughs) I'M SERIOUS.
I WANNA BE...

09:14.166 --> 09:16.291
HELPFUL, AND IF BEING IN BED
WITH US IS COMFORTING,

09:16.333 --> 09:17.917
I AM ALL FOR IT,

09:17.959 --> 09:19.583
BUT I JUST DON'T WANT
TO DO THE WRONG THING.

09:19.625 --> 09:22.583
SHE SAID THAT MASON NEEDS
A LITTLE MORE TOUGH LOVE.

09:22.625 --> 09:24.917
MM. SO WHAT DO WE DO?

09:24.959 --> 09:26.917
UH, WE DON'T DO ANYTHING.
NOT YET.

09:26.959 --> 09:28.917
WAIT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

09:28.959 --> 09:30.291
I MEAN, VIOLET'S NOT WRONG,
BUT I KNOW MASON.

09:30.333 --> 09:31.667
WHAT HE NEEDS IS TIME
AND COMFORT.

09:31.709 --> 09:33.041
HE DOESN'T NEED
ANOTHER CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW.

09:33.083 --> 09:34.625
IS THAT REALLY WHAT
HE NEEDS

09:34.667 --> 09:37.166
OR IS THAT ALL YOU'RE
CAPABLE OF GIVING HIM?

09:37.208 --> 09:38.792
OKAY, I HAVE A PATIENT
IN 15 MINUTES.

09:38.834 --> 09:40.000
WE CAN EITHER SPEND THAT TIME

09:40.041 --> 09:41.041
DISCUSSING REGRESSIVE
BED-WETTING

09:41.083 --> 09:42.500
OR WE CAN GET OUR YA-YAS OUT.

09:42.542 --> 09:44.375
UP TO YOU.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.208
TAKE YOUR PANTS OFF.

09:46.250 --> 09:49.208
(both pant)

09:49.250 --> 09:52.959
(people speaking indistinctly)

09:53.000 --> 09:55.667
I'M GOING HOME.

09:55.709 --> 09:57.750
HEY, THERE'S A, UH,
BEAUTY PAGEANT ON TONIGHT.

09:57.792 --> 09:59.291
YOU WANT TO COME OVER
AND MAKE MEAN JOKES

09:59.333 --> 10:01.000
DURING THE TALENT PORTION?

10:03.083 --> 10:04.917
NO, THANKS.

10:04.959 --> 10:06.875
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

10:06.917 --> 10:08.291
LOOK, ARE YOU TAKING
AN IRON SUPPLEMENT?

10:08.333 --> 10:09.542
YOU LOOK PALE.

10:09.583 --> 10:12.041
YOU DON'T WANT
GESTATIONAL ANEMIA.

10:12.083 --> 10:14.333
AMELIA...

10:14.375 --> 10:17.917
I MEAN, THERE ARE NO WORDS
TO DESCRIBE HOW AWFUL

10:17.959 --> 10:21.417
AND... UNFAIR THIS IS
TO YOU.

10:21.458 --> 10:23.041
AND I GET THAT, BUT...

10:23.083 --> 10:25.709
I MISS YOU.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.709
I WANT YOU IN MY LIFE.
I WANT YOU IN HENRY'S LIFE.

10:28.750 --> 10:29.917
I-I WANT--

10:29.959 --> 10:33.041
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU WANT,
ADDISON.

10:33.083 --> 10:35.583
I JUST DON'T CARE.

10:46.500 --> 10:48.166
(man)
SOMEBODY STABBED MY BABY.

10:48.208 --> 10:49.583
HOW COULD THAT HAPPEN?

10:49.625 --> 10:51.000
THERE'S NO LOGIC TO IT.

10:51.041 --> 10:54.709
YOU CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO--
TO RATIONALIZE IT.

10:54.750 --> 10:56.500
I CAN SEE WHAT THIS IS
DOING TO YOUR WIFE.

10:56.542 --> 10:58.583
HOW DO YOU THINK MISSY
IS HOLDING UP?

10:58.625 --> 11:00.041
WHAT?

11:00.083 --> 11:01.917
H-HOW DO YOU THINK SHE'S
DOING WITH ALL OF THIS?

11:01.959 --> 11:04.041
WHY DOES THAT MATTER?

11:04.083 --> 11:05.625
UH, WELL, THERE'S, UM...

11:05.667 --> 11:08.083
SEVERAL VERY GOOD DOCTORS
LOOKING AFTER DREA

11:08.125 --> 11:10.166
AND THIS IS
A VERY TRAUMATIC EVENT,

11:10.208 --> 11:13.041
SO I WAS THINKING IF YOU'D LIKE
ME TO, I CAN SPEAK TO MISSY--

11:13.083 --> 11:14.083
NO.

11:14.125 --> 11:15.959
OKAY.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.166
CAN I ASK YOU WHY?

11:17.208 --> 11:19.291
I JUST...

11:19.333 --> 11:21.625
LOOK, I DON'T NEED
ANOTHER PERSON

11:21.667 --> 11:24.291
TELLING ME SHE'S CARELESS
AND HAS BAD JUDGMENT

11:24.333 --> 11:26.041
AND--AND IS HEADING
IN THE WRONG DIRECTION, OKAY?

11:26.083 --> 11:27.291
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS GONNA
TALK TO HER ABOUT--

11:27.333 --> 11:28.917
MY BABY GIRL IS FIGHTING
FOR HER LIFE,

11:28.959 --> 11:31.125
AND HOW MISSY FEELS
REALLY ISN'T MY PRIMARY CONCERN.

11:31.166 --> 11:33.041
I DON'T NEED A REFERENDUM
ON MY PARENTING.

11:33.083 --> 11:34.041
I'M SO SORRY.

11:34.083 --> 11:35.542
I CAN SEE HOW THIS IS
UPSETTING YOU.

11:35.583 --> 11:37.500
PLEASE JUST LEAVE US
THE HELL ALONE.

11:40.709 --> 11:42.667
(elevator bell dings)

11:42.709 --> 11:44.041
HOW'S THE FAMILY HOLDING UP?

11:44.083 --> 11:45.041
MOM'S DESTROYED,
DAD'S FURIOUS.

11:45.083 --> 11:46.458
AND MISSY?

11:46.500 --> 11:47.875
UH, I DON'T KNOW.
HE WON'T LET ME TALK TO HER.

11:47.917 --> 11:49.041
SHE'S PROBABLY
STILL IN SHOCK.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.041
MAYBE.

11:50.083 --> 11:52.458
VIOLET?

11:52.500 --> 11:55.041
WELL, HER--HER AFFECT
SEEMED A LITTLE OFF.

11:55.083 --> 11:56.208
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
SHE WAS UPSET.

11:56.250 --> 11:57.625
WELL, UNTIL SHE WASN'T,
YOU KNOW?

11:57.667 --> 11:59.041
SHE WAS CRYING
AND THEN SHE STOPPED.

11:59.083 --> 12:01.208
IT WAS LIKE A-A PERFORMANCE
THAT SHE TURNED OFF.

12:01.250 --> 12:03.417
WHAT I SAW WAS A LITTLE GIRL
WHO WAS TRAUMATIZED

12:03.458 --> 12:06.083
BY SEEING HER SISTER
NEAR DEATH.

12:06.125 --> 12:08.083
EVERYBODY REACTS DIFFERENTLY
TO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

12:08.125 --> 12:09.583
I REALIZE THAT, PETE,
BUT MY INSTINCTS

12:09.625 --> 12:11.208
ARE TELLING ME THAT
SOMETHING ELSE IS GOING ON.

12:11.250 --> 12:12.417
I...
(sighs)

12:12.458 --> 12:15.041
I'M A SHRINK.
I DO THIS FOR A LIVING.

12:15.083 --> 12:16.709
YEAH, AND YOU DO IT
AT HOME

12:16.750 --> 12:18.875
AND THE GROCERY STORE,
THE DRY CLEANERS.

12:18.917 --> 12:21.500
VIOLET, YOU INSERT YOURSELF
INTO PEOPLE'S LIVES.

12:21.542 --> 12:23.500
YOU THINK YOU KNOW THEM BETTER
THAN THEY KNOW THEMSELVES.

12:23.542 --> 12:25.917
CAN'T YOU JUST TURN IT OFF?

12:25.959 --> 12:28.166
NO, I CAN'T.

12:28.208 --> 12:30.291
AND IGNORING A PROBLEM

12:30.333 --> 12:31.917
DOESN'T MEAN
THAT IT'S GONNA GO AWAY.

12:31.959 --> 12:35.000
AND I THINK THERE'S
A BIG PROBLEM HERE.

12:35.041 --> 12:36.709
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

12:41.125 --> 12:44.041
SOMETIMES I THINK I'M LIVING
WITH 2 9 YEAR OLDS.

12:44.083 --> 12:45.083
(chuckles)

12:45.125 --> 12:47.500
MASON AT LEAST
IS AN ACTUAL KID.

12:47.542 --> 12:49.417
BUT COOPER, AHH...
(pours liquid)

12:49.458 --> 12:51.417
HE IS JUST PITCHING A FIT
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO

12:51.458 --> 12:53.834
WHAT VIOLET THINKS
HE SHOULD DO FOR MASON,

12:53.875 --> 12:56.041
NOT TO MENTION

12:56.083 --> 12:59.041
WHAT I THINK HE SHOULD DO.

12:59.083 --> 13:01.625
(exhales)
I COULD USE A MEETING.

13:01.667 --> 13:03.250
YOU WANT TO COME?

13:03.291 --> 13:05.125
(people speaking indistinctly)

13:05.166 --> 13:08.250
AND LISTEN TO YOU SHARE
ABOUT HOW DIFFICULT IT IS

13:08.291 --> 13:09.834
TO RAISE A CHILD?

13:09.875 --> 13:11.792
SORRY.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.875
I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT.

13:13.917 --> 13:16.583
AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH,
I KNOW IT MUST BE--

13:16.625 --> 13:18.458
NO, YOU DON'T KNOW.

13:18.500 --> 13:20.959
YOU JUST DON'T.

13:26.208 --> 13:27.959
HAVE YOU BEEN GOING
TO MEETINGS?

13:28.000 --> 13:30.458
YOU NEED TO KEEP WORKING
THE STEPS--

13:30.500 --> 13:33.000
SKIP THE BILL W. CRAP.
I AM NOT GONNA USE.

13:33.041 --> 13:34.458
SO YOU AND ADDISON

13:34.500 --> 13:37.750
AND VIOLET CAN ALL CHECK ME

16:00.625 --> 16:03.250
IT IS FOR DESSERT
IF YOU EAT...

16:03.291 --> 16:05.291
(closes zipper)
YOUR WHOLE SANDWICH.

16:05.333 --> 16:08.083
YOU CAN TOSS IT
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,

16:08.125 --> 16:10.041
AND WE'LL TRY SOMETHING ELSE.

16:10.083 --> 16:12.000
OKAY?

16:18.125 --> 16:20.667
MASE...

16:20.709 --> 16:23.083
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
WITH YOU?

16:23.125 --> 16:24.500
YOU'RE NOT TALKING TO ME.

16:24.542 --> 16:26.875
YOU'RE NOT TALKING
TO YOUR DADDY.

16:26.917 --> 16:29.750
YOUR TEACHERS SAY YOU WON'T
TALK TO ANYONE AT SCHOOL.

16:29.792 --> 16:33.709
YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO GO
THROUGH LIFE LIKE THIS, DO YOU?

16:33.750 --> 16:35.542
(sighs) LOOK...

16:35.583 --> 16:37.375
(sniffles)

16:37.417 --> 16:39.333
I KNOW YOU'RE HURTIN'

16:39.375 --> 16:43.208
IN A WAY A KID NEVER SHOULD.

16:43.250 --> 16:47.291
I LOST MY DADDY
AS AN ADULT,

16:47.333 --> 16:49.375
AND IT NEARLY WRECKED ME.

16:49.417 --> 16:52.083
SO THIS...

16:52.125 --> 16:54.625
I CAN'T IMAGINE.

16:54.667 --> 16:58.166
I'VE TRIED TO BE THE PERSON
IN YOUR LIFE

16:58.208 --> 17:00.041
WHO ALWAYS TELLS YOU
THE WHOLE TRUTH,

17:00.083 --> 17:02.166
EVEN IF IT'S HARD.

17:02.208 --> 17:04.834
AND THAT'S
WHAT I'M DOING NOW.

17:04.875 --> 17:07.458
YOU CAN'T NOT COMMUNICATE.

17:07.500 --> 17:10.125
IT'S GONNA MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE
FOR ANYONE TO HELP YOU.

17:10.166 --> 17:11.875
SO RIGHT HERE,

17:11.917 --> 17:13.583
RIGHT NOW,

17:13.625 --> 17:16.250
YOU CAN SAY
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

17:16.291 --> 17:19.709
BUT YOU HAVE TO
SAY SOMETHING.

17:25.875 --> 17:29.583
I'M STARTING
TO FORGET THINGS.

17:29.625 --> 17:31.667
LIKE WHAT?

17:31.709 --> 17:34.041
THE WAY MY MOM
PACKS LUNCH.

17:34.083 --> 17:37.375
THE KIND OF THINGS
WE'D TALK ABOUT.

17:37.417 --> 17:39.166
IT MAKES ME SAD.

17:39.208 --> 17:41.834
(inhales and exhales)

17:41.875 --> 17:44.417
I CAN SEE HOW THAT WOULD.

17:44.458 --> 17:46.917
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT.

17:46.959 --> 17:49.667
WE CAN TALK ABOUT ANYTHING.

17:49.709 --> 17:51.875
I DON'T WANT TO.

17:51.917 --> 17:56.041
I KNOW MY MOM WANTED US
TO TALK ABOUT HER.

17:56.083 --> 17:58.667
AND I KNOW YOU AND MY DAD
WANT THINGS TO BE NORMAL.

17:58.709 --> 18:01.417
BUT I DON'T FEEL NORMAL.

18:01.458 --> 18:05.000
AND I DON'T WANT TO TALK.

18:07.667 --> 18:08.834
(clicks)

18:08.875 --> 18:12.041
(respirator hissing
and clicking)

18:12.083 --> 18:14.542
(Amelia)
NO SPONTANEOUS BREATH.

18:14.583 --> 18:16.041
THAT'S CONSISTENT
WITH HER E.E.G.

18:16.083 --> 18:18.083
DREA IS BRAIN DEAD.

18:18.125 --> 18:20.041
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

18:20.083 --> 18:22.500
(hissing and clicking continue)

18:22.542 --> 18:24.917
(beeping continues)

18:24.959 --> 18:26.709
AMELIA, ARE YOU--

18:26.750 --> 18:28.041
I'LL BE FINE.

18:28.083 --> 18:29.667
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
TELL THE PARENTS ANYWAY?

18:29.709 --> 18:32.041
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH ME.

18:32.083 --> 18:33.834
AMELIA.

18:33.875 --> 18:36.041
(exhales)

18:36.083 --> 18:38.875
I'M GONNA TELL THE PARENTS.

18:38.917 --> 18:40.083
(exhales)

18:44.083 --> 18:46.333
(door slides open)

18:46.375 --> 18:48.709
(crying) WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,
BRAIN DEAD?

18:48.750 --> 18:50.917
IT MEANS, SHE'S NOT GONNA
COME OUT OF THIS COMA

18:50.959 --> 18:52.959
AND SHE CAN'T BREATHE
ON HER OWN.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.291
BRAIN DEATH IS MORE OF
A--OF A CLINICAL DETERMINATION.

18:56.333 --> 18:58.291
THE--THE QUESTIONS THAT
YOU'RE GONNA BE PROCESSING

18:58.333 --> 19:01.333
ARE LESS MEDICAL
AND MORE SPIRITUAL.

19:01.375 --> 19:03.917
YOU MEAN, DO WE TAKE
DREA OFF THE RESPIRATOR?

19:03.959 --> 19:05.542
AND IF SO, WHEN?

19:05.583 --> 19:06.917
(Violet) THAT'S RIGHT.

19:06.959 --> 19:08.792
WELL, HOW LONG CAN SHE STAY
LIKE SHE IS?

19:08.834 --> 19:11.125
WE CAN KEEP HER BREATHING
ON THE RESPIRATOR INDEFINITELY.

19:11.166 --> 19:13.250
BUT SHE WON'T WAKE UP,
AND HER BODY

19:13.291 --> 19:14.875
WILL JUST CONTINUE
TO DETERIORATE.

19:14.917 --> 19:16.041
OH, GOD.

19:16.083 --> 19:17.083
SO THERE'S NO DECISION
TO MAKE.

19:17.125 --> 19:20.750
WELL, SOMETIMES,
IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS,

19:20.792 --> 19:24.750
A FAMILY WILL DECIDE TO DONATE
THEIR LOVED ONE'S ORGANS.

19:24.792 --> 19:28.917
YOU MEAN, LIKE, CUT HER OPEN
AND TAKE EVERYTHING OUT?

19:28.959 --> 19:30.917
MISSY, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TAKE A WALK?

19:30.959 --> 19:32.041
NO.

19:32.083 --> 19:33.291
YEAH, YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,

19:33.333 --> 19:35.041
THAT--
THAT'S A GOOD SUGGESTION.

19:35.083 --> 19:36.291
NO, I-I DON'T WANT
TO MISS ANY OF THIS.

19:36.333 --> 19:38.208
THERE'S A--THERE'S
A CAFETERIA DOWNSTAIRS.

19:38.250 --> 19:39.917
NO, I WANT TO STAY HERE.

19:39.959 --> 19:41.291
YOU HEARD YOUR MOTHER.

19:41.333 --> 19:43.041
(huffs)

19:46.750 --> 19:48.041
(knock on doorjamb)

19:48.083 --> 19:51.208
HEY, I JUST, UH,
WANTED TO CHECK IN.

19:53.417 --> 19:55.750
ADDISON SEND YOU?

19:55.792 --> 19:57.959
NO, BUT, UH, I KNOW

19:58.000 --> 19:59.458
YOU TWO AREN'T...

19:59.500 --> 20:02.250
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE
PICKED ANOTHER O.B. YET OR NOT,

20:02.291 --> 20:06.041
BUT IF YOU WANTED TO TALK
ABOUT YOUR OPTIONS...

20:06.083 --> 20:08.041
WHAT OPTIONS?

20:08.083 --> 20:10.667
THIS IS WAY PAST THE TIME
FOR TERMINATION.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.041
WELL, THERE'S STILL
A FUTURE TO PLAN FOR.

20:12.083 --> 20:13.333
MY BABY HAS NO FUTURE.

20:13.375 --> 20:16.125
BUT YOU DO.

20:16.166 --> 20:18.834
(scoffs)

20:18.875 --> 20:21.041
SO WHAT,
WE'RE GONNA HOLD HANDS

20:21.083 --> 20:24.166
AND TALK ABOUT MY FEELINGS?
(sighs)

20:24.208 --> 20:27.041
I'M SICK TO DEATH
OF PEOPLE WANTING

20:27.083 --> 20:28.458
TO DISCUSS MY FEELINGS.

20:28.500 --> 20:31.041
THAT'S YOUR BUSINESS.
NOT MINE.

20:35.333 --> 20:36.500
THANK YOU.

20:36.542 --> 20:38.041
BUT YOU'RE A DOCTOR,

20:38.083 --> 20:40.250
SO YOU KNOW YOU NEED
BLOOD AND URINE TESTS.

20:40.291 --> 20:43.250
PRENATAL CARE IS NOT
JUST ABOUT THE BABY.

20:43.291 --> 20:46.041
I'M HERE ABOUT YOUR HEALTH,
AMELIA,

20:46.083 --> 20:48.041
AND...

20:48.083 --> 20:51.291
I'M HERE ABOUT YOU,

20:51.333 --> 20:53.333
BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE A FUTURE.

20:57.125 --> 20:59.000
IS IT...

21:00.834 --> 21:02.959
THE DRUGS I TOOK...

21:05.250 --> 21:07.750
DID I DO THIS TO MY BABY?

21:07.792 --> 21:10.041
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

21:10.083 --> 21:12.417
LISTEN TO ME, THIS...

21:12.458 --> 21:15.291
THIS WAS A BAD SPIN
OF THE GENETIC WHEEL.

21:15.333 --> 21:17.000
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

21:19.083 --> 21:21.333
HEY, THIS IS NOT
YOUR FAULT.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.208
(sobs)

21:25.250 --> 21:26.458
(sniffles)

21:26.500 --> 21:29.458
(crying)

21:41.917 --> 21:43.041
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS

21:43.083 --> 21:44.250
WHEN THEY TAKE SOMEONE
OFF OF LIFE SUPPORT.

21:44.291 --> 21:47.458
A LOT OF TIMES,
THEY DON'T DIE RIGHT AWAY.

21:47.500 --> 21:50.125
THEY GAG AND STRUGGLE,

21:50.166 --> 21:52.709
AND IT GETS ALL MESSY.

21:52.750 --> 21:55.375
DID WHAT...

21:55.417 --> 21:57.333
DID WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR SISTER

21:57.375 --> 21:58.792
SCARE YOU?

22:00.709 --> 22:01.917
WELL, IT WOULD SCARE ME.

22:03.083 --> 22:05.917
(people speaking indistinctly)

22:05.959 --> 22:07.709
YOU KNOW,
I WAS ATTACKED ONCE

22:07.750 --> 22:09.375
AND STABBED.

22:09.417 --> 22:11.375
SOMEBODY CUT MY BABY
OUT OF ME

22:11.417 --> 22:15.125
AND LEFT ME ON THE FLOOR
OF MY HOUSE BLEEDING TO DEATH.

22:17.083 --> 22:20.709
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES, I...

22:20.750 --> 22:24.625
SOMETIMES, I WONDER WHAT
THE WOMAN WHO ATTACKED ME FELT

22:24.667 --> 22:27.583
WHEN SHE WAS HOLDING
THAT KNIFE...

22:27.625 --> 22:31.041
COMING TOWARD ME.

22:31.083 --> 22:34.000
I MEAN, WELL,
SHE PROBABLY FELT...

22:35.542 --> 22:36.834
POWERFUL,

22:36.875 --> 22:39.834
LIKE SHE HAD ALL THE CONTROL.

22:39.875 --> 22:42.792
YOU KNOW, LIKE SHE COULD...

22:42.834 --> 22:45.834
HURT YOU OR KILL YOU OR...

22:48.083 --> 22:51.208
DO ANYTHING SHE WANTED.

22:57.083 --> 22:58.834
BUT I COULD BE WRONG.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.875
I MEAN, I-I HAD NO IDEA
THAT I WAS WALKING INTO

23:02.917 --> 23:05.041
WHAT IS OBVIOUSLY A TOTALLY
DYSFUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIP

23:05.083 --> 23:06.667
BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE
WHO HAVE NO IDEA

23:06.709 --> 23:08.041
WHAT THE HELL
THEY WANT FROM EACH OTHER.

23:08.083 --> 23:09.333
MAYBE THEY'RE IN LOVE.

23:09.375 --> 23:10.750
IF SHE WANTS TO BE
KISSING SAM,

23:10.792 --> 23:12.125
WHY IS SHE KISSING ME?

23:12.166 --> 23:14.917
WELL, WHEN WE WERE GOING OUT, IT
WAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT 'CAUSE--

23:14.959 --> 23:16.291
WHAT?

23:16.333 --> 23:18.291
YOU T--
YOU DATED ADDISON, TOO?

23:18.333 --> 23:19.917
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT?

23:19.959 --> 23:22.041
MAN, IS THERE ANY GUY IN THIS
PRACTICE SHE HASN'T DATED?

23:22.083 --> 23:26.041
JUST THE THREE OF US
TO MY KNOWLEDGE.

23:26.083 --> 23:28.375
ALL RIGHT, SO IF YOU WERE ME,
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

23:28.417 --> 23:31.792
WELL, ADDISON IS, UM...
(chuckles)

23:31.834 --> 23:34.000
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL,
SMART, FUNNY,

23:34.041 --> 23:36.291
BUT SHE'S... COMPLICATED.

23:36.333 --> 23:39.041
I COULDN'T MAKE IT WORK,
BUT IF YOU CAN,

23:39.083 --> 23:40.917
SHE'S WORTH IT.

23:40.959 --> 23:42.875
(people speak indistinctly)

23:42.917 --> 23:45.458
(footsteps approach)

23:45.500 --> 23:46.917
(Cooper) OH.

23:46.959 --> 23:48.959
I DIDN'T THINK WE WERE
DOING THIS TILL LATER,

23:49.000 --> 23:51.250
BUT I LIKE YOUR AMBITION,
DR. KING.

23:51.291 --> 23:52.917
MASON TALKED.

23:52.959 --> 23:56.041
WHAT? THAT'S--THAT...
HOW'D YOU GET HIM TO DO THAT?

23:56.083 --> 23:57.959
I TOLD HIM SILENCE WASN'T
AN OPTION ANYMORE,

23:58.000 --> 24:00.542
THAT IT WAS CAUSING
MORE PROBLEMS FOR ALL OF US--
CHARLOTTE.

24:00.583 --> 24:02.417
COOP, IT WORKED.

24:02.458 --> 24:03.750
WELL,
BECAUSE YOU THREATENED HIM.

24:03.792 --> 24:05.041
I DIDN'T THREATEN HIM.

24:05.083 --> 24:06.333
YOU JUST SAID THAT YOU TOLD HIM
THAT SILENCE WASN'T--

24:06.375 --> 24:07.750
COOP, I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE HAPPY.

24:07.792 --> 24:10.041
NO, WHAT I AM IS...
(inhales) CONCERNED

24:10.083 --> 24:12.041
THAT MASON IS NOT
GETTING ENOUGH TIME

24:12.083 --> 24:13.250
TO GRIEVE THE WAY
THAT HE NEEDS TO.

24:13.291 --> 24:15.041
I MEAN, ALL DUE RESPECT
TO VIOLET,

24:15.083 --> 24:16.625
AND FRANKLY,
EVEN LESS TO YOU,

24:16.667 --> 24:18.625
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY
MAKING THIS ABOUT US.

24:18.667 --> 24:21.583
IT IS ABOUT MASON
AND WHAT HE NEEDS.

24:21.625 --> 24:23.166
YOU REALLY THINK
THIS LITTLE OF ME?

24:23.208 --> 24:26.166
AGAIN, CHARLOTTE,
NOT ABOUT YOU.

24:26.208 --> 24:28.041
(Pete) THAT'S NOT A CONFESSION.

24:28.083 --> 24:29.542
WELL, IF YOU HAD SEEN HER
AND HEARD HER...

24:29.583 --> 24:31.750
DID SHE ACTUALLY TELL YOU
THAT SHE KILLED HER SISTER?

24:31.792 --> 24:33.041
NO, NOT IN SO MANY WORDS.

24:33.083 --> 24:34.542
THEN WHAT
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?
MY GUT INSTINCT.

24:34.583 --> 24:36.166
(chuckles)
I KNOW I'M RIGHT ON THIS.

24:36.208 --> 24:37.583
VIOLET, NO OFFENSE,

24:37.625 --> 24:39.000
BUT YOU THINK YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

24:39.041 --> 24:40.166
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

24:40.208 --> 24:42.583
UH, LISTEN, OKAY, I'M SORRY.
I APOLOGIZE.

24:42.625 --> 24:44.375
IT'S JUST, YOU CAN'T
GO TO THE POLICE

24:44.417 --> 24:45.542
WITH YOUR GUT INSTINCT.

24:45.583 --> 24:46.750
WELL, THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

24:46.792 --> 24:47.959
THEN WHAT IS THE POINT?

24:48.000 --> 24:49.333
WHAT IF SHE DOES THIS AGAIN?

24:49.375 --> 24:53.083
♪♪♪

24:56.083 --> 24:59.000
♪♪♪

25:01.625 --> 25:03.208
(knock on door)

25:09.083 --> 25:10.917
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO ME.

25:10.959 --> 25:12.709
YOU'RE RIGHT.

25:12.750 --> 25:14.041
SO JUST GO.

25:14.083 --> 25:16.041
I WILL, SOON,
BUT I LOVE YOU

25:16.083 --> 25:17.917
AND I NEED YOU TO LISTEN.

25:17.959 --> 25:20.041
YOU NEED A PLAN.
YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT--

25:20.083 --> 25:23.083
DON'T YOU DARE STAND THERE
AND TELL ME WHAT I NEED.

25:23.125 --> 25:25.041
DON'T YOU DARE.

25:27.083 --> 25:30.750
MY LIFE HAS TURNED INTO
A HORROR SHOW,

25:30.792 --> 25:33.166
AND ALL I CAN DO IS STAND BACK
AND WATCH IT PLAY OUT.

25:33.208 --> 25:36.125
MY BABY HAS NO BRAIN.

25:36.166 --> 25:38.041
NO BRAIN.

25:38.083 --> 25:40.041
I AM A DAMN NEUROSURGEON,

25:40.083 --> 25:41.250
AND MY BABY HAS NO BRAIN.

25:41.291 --> 25:42.875
I WOULD SAY GOD HAS
A SENSE OF HUMOR,

25:42.917 --> 25:44.875
BUT THERE IS NO GOD.

25:44.917 --> 25:46.458
NO GOD WOULD DO THIS.

25:46.500 --> 25:49.041
I AM SO, SO SORRY--
JUST STOP IT.

25:49.083 --> 25:51.834
JUST DON'T LOOK AT ME
WITH YOUR PITY AND GUILT.

25:51.875 --> 25:53.250
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

25:53.291 --> 25:55.458
EVERY TIME I LOOK AT YOU,
I SEE

25:55.500 --> 25:57.792
THAT PERFECT, HEALTHY BABY
ATTACHED TO YOUR HIP,

25:57.834 --> 26:00.667
AND HE SMILES,
AND YOU SMILE,

26:00.709 --> 26:03.041
AND ALL OF THAT JOY MAKES ME
WANT TO SCREAM

26:03.083 --> 26:05.083
AND CLAW YOUR EYES OUT

FROM YOUR HANDS.

26:07.542 --> 26:12.667
(voice breaking)
I AM SO ANGRY AT YOU...

26:12.709 --> 26:14.583
AND JEALOUS OF YOU...

26:14.625 --> 26:17.583
OF THIS... LIFE,

26:17.625 --> 26:20.041
THIS--THIS DREAM
OF A LIFE YOU HAVE.

26:20.083 --> 26:23.166
I WISH I COULD BE HAPPY
FOR YOU, BUT I CAN'T.

26:23.208 --> 26:27.041
I CAN'T BECAUSE I HATE YOU,
ADDISON.

26:27.083 --> 26:31.250
I HATE YOU, AND I DON'T
HAVE ROOM FOR THAT

26:31.291 --> 26:32.917
ON TOP OF ALL THE BITTERNESS
AND PAIN

26:32.959 --> 26:35.291
THAT IS BURYING ME
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

26:35.333 --> 26:39.250
I DON'T--
I HAVE NO MORE ROOM.

OHH. COME HERE.

HENRY.

27:27.792 --> 27:30.250
OH, YES.

27:30.291 --> 27:33.166
HI, SWEETIE. (kisses)

27:36.917 --> 27:38.041
COME ON, SAM.

27:38.083 --> 27:39.041
ADDISON AND I WERE
BARELY BROKEN UP

27:39.083 --> 27:40.291
BEFORE YOU MADE A PLAY
FOR HER.

27:40.333 --> 27:41.500
LOOK, I'M DONE TALKING
ABOUT THIS.

27:41.542 --> 27:42.709
BODY WASN'T EVEN COLD YET.

27:42.750 --> 27:43.917
LOOK, YOU BROKE UP WITH HER.

27:43.959 --> 27:45.041
SHE WANTED A BABY,
AND YOU RAN.

27:45.083 --> 27:46.375
I DIDN'T RUN.

27:46.417 --> 27:47.583
I LEFT BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
TO BE A FATHER AGAIN.

27:47.625 --> 27:49.000
SO WHY ARE YOU BACK NOW?

27:49.041 --> 27:50.041
SHE'S GOT A BABY
THAT ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE.

27:50.083 --> 27:51.792
BECAUSE I LOVE HER.

27:51.834 --> 27:54.166
LISTEN, SAM, DON'T TAKE
THIS THE WRONG WAY,

27:54.208 --> 27:57.291
BUT IF SHE LOVED YOU BACK,
SHE WOULDN'T BE KISSING ME.

27:57.333 --> 27:59.083
HEY, SHE KISSED US BOTH

27:59.125 --> 28:02.000
ON THE SAME DAY.

28:04.041 --> 28:06.291
(sighs)
YOU KNOW WHAT?

28:06.333 --> 28:08.166
WE'RE NOT THE PROBLEM.

28:08.208 --> 28:10.125
SO WHY ARE WE ARGUING
ABOUT THIS?

28:13.000 --> 28:15.250
(Violet) I WOULD NEVER
WANT TO DO ANYTHING

28:15.291 --> 28:17.959
TO MAKE THIS WORSE
OR MORE COMPLICATED.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.667
BUT MISSY...

28:20.709 --> 28:24.041
(sighs) SHE'S SHOWING
SOME SIGNS--

28:24.083 --> 28:26.458
RISK TAKING,
FASCINATION WITH DEATH

28:26.500 --> 28:27.875
AND TABOO BEHAVIOR--

28:27.917 --> 28:32.041
THAT ARE TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED
WITH JUVENILE SOCIOPATHY.

28:32.083 --> 28:35.291
I THINK MISSY WAS INVOLVED
IN DREA'S STABBING.

28:36.792 --> 28:39.166
THAT-- (laughs)
THAT'S CRAZY.

28:39.208 --> 28:42.792
TELL HER SHE'S WRONG.

28:44.250 --> 28:46.000
GARY?

28:47.291 --> 28:48.709
GARY.

28:48.750 --> 28:49.917
(gasping)

28:49.959 --> 28:51.291
JASMINE, HOW CAN YOU
BE THIS BLIND?

28:51.333 --> 28:52.709
NO, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE JUST UPSET.

28:52.750 --> 28:55.041
MISSY MAY HAVE KILLED
OUR CHILD.

28:55.083 --> 28:57.709
MISSY IS OUR CHILD.

29:05.291 --> 29:07.625
SO, UH, NIGHT-LIGHT IS ON

29:07.667 --> 29:10.917
AND WE ARE
RIGHT DOWN THE HALL.

29:10.959 --> 29:12.709
HEY, I HAVE
A LIGHT DAY TOMORROW.

29:12.750 --> 29:14.709
I WAS THINKING I COULD
PICK YOU UP AFTER SCHOOL,

29:14.750 --> 29:17.875
WE COULD GO THE PARK
OR SOMETHING.

29:17.917 --> 29:22.542
ARE YOU REALLY STICKING
WITH THE NO-TALKING THING?

29:25.000 --> 29:28.917
CHARLOTTE SAID YOU TALKED
TO HER THIS MORNING.

29:28.959 --> 29:30.333
HOW WAS THAT?

29:38.083 --> 29:40.542
I AM FRUSTRATED BECAUSE YOU
WERE CONDESCENDING TO ME.

29:40.583 --> 29:42.125
YOU COMPLETELY DISMISSED
MY TOTALLY JUSTIFIED CONCERNS...

29:42.166 --> 29:44.041
NO, I JUST DIDN'T AGREE.
ABOUT OUR PATIENT.

29:44.083 --> 29:45.667
I DIDN'T DISMISS IT. I D--
NO, DISMISSING IS EXACTLY
WHAT YOU DID.

29:45.709 --> 29:47.083
OH, SERIOUSLY, VIOLET?

29:47.125 --> 29:48.875
ARE YOU TOTALLY UNAWARE
OF HOW OFTEN YOU TELL ME

29:48.917 --> 29:51.208
WHAT I THINK, WHAT I FEEL,
WHY I DO WHAT I DO?

29:51.250 --> 29:53.041
I--SHE--SHE FORCED ME TO GET
IN TOUCH WITH MY FAMILY.

29:53.083 --> 29:55.000
WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE
A VERY GOOD THING.

29:55.041 --> 29:56.166
OR--BUT--BUT IT WASN'T
YOUR CALL.

29:56.208 --> 29:57.375
OH, COME ON, PETE.

29:57.417 --> 29:59.000
I AM NOT LUCAS.
I'M A GROWN MAN--

29:59.041 --> 30:00.166
WELL, AND YET OUR TODDLER IS
MORE IN TOUCH WITH HIS FEELINGS

30:00.208 --> 30:01.792
THAN YOU ARE AND--AND BETTER
AT ARTICULATING THEM.

30:01.834 --> 30:03.250
OKAY, NOW THAT
IS A LOW BLOW.

30:03.291 --> 30:04.709
PETE, YOU ARE
SO EMOTIONALLY CUT OFF

30:04.750 --> 30:06.709
AND SO UNWILLING TO COMMUNICATE
THAT I HAVE NO CHOICE

30:06.750 --> 30:08.959
BUT TO ANALYZE
AND ASCRIBE MOTIVE.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.333
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY OUR MARRIAGE IS DYING.

30:10.375 --> 30:11.917
HONESTLY, PETE,
HOW DID WE GET HERE?

30:11.959 --> 30:13.667
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I'M SURE WE'LL DISCOVER

30:13.709 --> 30:15.458
THAT IT WAS ALL MY FAULT!

30:15.500 --> 30:17.750
(sighs)

30:17.792 --> 30:19.083
(sighs)

30:19.125 --> 30:23.041
WHY DO YOU LOOK SO SMUG?

30:23.083 --> 30:25.709
I'M JUST HOPEFUL
FOR THE TWO OF YOU.

30:25.750 --> 30:28.041
WHAT YOU'RE READING AS SMUG,
THAT'S--THAT'S HOPE.

30:28.083 --> 30:29.041
WERE YOU NOT LISTENING--

30:29.083 --> 30:30.709
I WAS LISTENING.

30:30.750 --> 30:33.291
AND IT--IT WAS UGLY.

30:33.333 --> 30:35.166
BUT UGLY CAN BE HONEST.

30:35.208 --> 30:38.041
UGLY CAN GIVE THE OTHER PERSON
A CHANCE TO CHANGE.

30:38.083 --> 30:40.000
UGLY GIVES ME HOPE.

30:40.041 --> 30:41.917
WHEN IT WAS ALL ABOUT
BEING POLITE,

30:41.959 --> 30:44.667
YOUR MARRIAGE
DIDN'T STAND A CHANCE.

30:56.375 --> 31:00.000
I CAN'T IMAGINE YOUR PAIN,
KNOWING WHAT COMES NEXT.

31:00.041 --> 31:02.750
BUT I DO KNOW THIS,

31:02.792 --> 31:05.458
YOU'RE NOT DEALING WITH IT.

31:05.500 --> 31:07.125
CHARLOTTE, I'M FINE.

31:07.166 --> 31:09.000
THAT'S CRAP.

31:09.041 --> 31:11.041
KEEPING EVERYTHING
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH INSIDE,

31:11.083 --> 31:13.041
SHUTTING OUT
THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU,

31:13.083 --> 31:15.125
THAT'S NOT DEALING.

31:15.166 --> 31:16.250
IT'S HIDING.

31:16.291 --> 31:19.875
YOU AND I, WE DON'T HAVE
THE LUXURY

31:19.917 --> 31:23.041
OF IGNORING OUR EMOTIONS,
HOPING THEY'LL JUST GO AWAY.

31:23.083 --> 31:25.834
THAT BITES PEOPLE LIKE US
IN THE ASS.

31:25.875 --> 31:28.041
THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GONNA
GET THROUGH THIS

31:28.083 --> 31:29.458
IS TO LET YOURSELF FEEL

31:29.500 --> 31:31.500
EVERY HEARTBREAKING,
GUT-WRENCHING PART OF IT.

31:37.750 --> 31:40.792
YOU'RE RIGHT.

31:40.834 --> 31:44.041
I JUST HAVEN'T BEEN READY.

31:44.083 --> 31:46.917
YOU WANT TO GO
TO A MEETING?

31:50.083 --> 31:52.750
COULD WE MAYBE SIT HERE
FOR A MINUTE INSTEAD?

31:54.208 --> 31:56.291
OF COURSE.

32:07.083 --> 32:09.000
I'M JUST NUMB,
CHARLOTTE.

32:10.959 --> 32:14.542
THAT'S A START.

32:14.583 --> 32:17.333
(exhales deeply)

32:17.375 --> 32:19.875
REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE
TALKING ABOUT THE WOMAN

32:19.917 --> 32:21.834
WHO ATTACKED ME,

32:21.875 --> 32:23.333
AND YOU SAID
SHE PROBABLY DID IT

32:23.375 --> 32:25.291
TO FEEL MORE POWERFUL?

32:25.333 --> 32:26.500
AT FIRST I THOUGHT

32:26.542 --> 32:29.041
YOU WERE SO SMART
TO FIGURE THAT OUT,

32:29.083 --> 32:32.625
BUT NOW I THINK
YOU'RE WRONG.

32:32.667 --> 32:35.333
I THINK SHE WAS
PROBABLY JEALOUS.

32:35.375 --> 32:37.417
I WAS HAVING A BABY,
AND SHE WASN'T.

32:37.458 --> 32:39.417
AND SHE...

32:39.458 --> 32:40.834
LASHED OUT.

32:40.875 --> 32:42.667
AND I DON'T THINK
SHE WAS THINKING ABOUT

32:42.709 --> 32:45.250
WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN AFTER,
TO HER OR TO ME.

32:45.291 --> 32:48.625
SHE WAS...
SHE WAS JUST CRAZY.

32:50.333 --> 32:52.000
WELL, MAYBE--

32:52.041 --> 32:54.917
COME ON, MISSY. WHY ELSE
WOULD YOU STAB SOMEONE?

32:54.959 --> 32:57.500
TO KNOW IF YOU COULD
REALLY DO IT.

32:57.542 --> 32:59.792
YEAH. I DON'T THINK SO.

32:59.834 --> 33:02.792
I MEAN, TO ACTUALLY PUT
A KNIFE INTO SOMEONE ELSE,

33:02.834 --> 33:04.250
IT'S...

33:04.291 --> 33:06.667
IT'S REALLY TOO SCARY
FOR MOST SANE PEOPLE.

33:06.709 --> 33:08.667
IT'S ONLY SCARY
FOR A MINUTE.

33:08.709 --> 33:10.667
AND THEN YOU PUSH PAST THAT,

33:10.709 --> 33:13.458
AND YOU'RE JUST...
YOU'RE...

33:13.500 --> 33:15.500
IN IT, AND...

33:15.542 --> 33:17.542
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S THE WAY
IT SEEMS IN MOVIES

33:17.583 --> 33:20.709
OR--OR BOOKS THAT YOU'VE READ,
BUT IN--IN REAL LIFE--

33:20.750 --> 33:21.917
NO, NO, NO, NO.

33:21.959 --> 33:24.667
I'M TALKING ABOUT
IN REAL LIFE.

33:32.083 --> 33:35.625
(whispering) I WAS THE ONE
WHO STABBED DREA.

33:35.667 --> 33:39.041
AND IT...
IT WASN'T THAT SCARY.

33:39.083 --> 33:41.166
I MEAN, I KNEW I WANTED TO,

33:41.208 --> 33:44.500
TO SEE WHAT IT WAS LIKE.

33:44.542 --> 33:47.041
AND IT WAS...

33:47.083 --> 33:50.125
IT WAS THE COOLEST THING
I HAVE EVER DONE.

33:50.166 --> 33:52.250
(normal voice) AND I MEAN,
YOU'RE TOTALLY RIGHT,

33:52.291 --> 33:56.583
I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT
WHAT COMES AFTER.

33:56.625 --> 33:59.041
(man) YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.
WAIT. WAIT.

33:59.083 --> 34:01.041
ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN AND WILL
BE USED AGAINST YOU...
YOU--WHAT?

34:01.083 --> 34:03.125
IN A COURT OF LAW. YOU HAVE
THE RIGHT TO HAVE...
NO, NO, YOU SAID
YOU UNDERSTOOD.

34:03.166 --> 34:04.959
AN ATTORNEY PRESENT
DURING QUESTIONING.
YOU NEED HELP, MISSY.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.792
NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU SAID YOU UNDERSTOOD.

34:06.834 --> 34:09.792
WAIT. NO. WAIT.
I THOUGHT YOU UNDERSTOOD.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.625
(lowered voice) YOU OKAY?

34:19.417 --> 34:21.458
(lowered voice) OH. (sighs)

34:21.500 --> 34:24.166
YEAH, HE WOULDN'T GO DOWN
LAST NIGHT, SO...

34:24.208 --> 34:26.583
NOW THAT HE'S FINALLY ASLEEP,
I DIDN'T WANT TO MOVE HIM.

34:26.625 --> 34:29.000
HE LOOKS SO PEACEFUL.

34:29.041 --> 34:31.583
AND MY SPINE IS ACTUALLY
FUSED TO THIS CHAIR.

34:31.625 --> 34:33.834
(laughs)

34:36.083 --> 34:39.917
SO I KNOW
THAT YOU KISSED JAKE.

34:41.875 --> 34:43.792
I'M NOT GONNA MAKE
A BIG DEAL...
SAM.

34:43.834 --> 34:45.875
OUT OF IT, BUT--

34:45.917 --> 34:47.709
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
TRULY, I AM.

34:47.750 --> 34:50.041
BUT... (sighs)

34:50.083 --> 34:52.709
UH, YOU, ME, JAKE--
THAT SEEMS LIKE A LIFETIME AGO.

34:52.750 --> 34:55.875
I AM JUST...

34:55.917 --> 34:58.625
JUST CONSUMED
WITH THIS LITTLE BOY.

34:58.667 --> 35:03.000
AND NOW I'M JUST
A SLEEP-DEPRIVED MOM...

35:04.291 --> 35:07.333
IN LOVE WITH HER CHILD.

35:07.375 --> 35:09.875
HMM? (kisses)

35:12.333 --> 35:15.333
(respirator hissing
and clicking)

35:15.375 --> 35:19.250
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

35:19.291 --> 35:20.959
OH, SORRY.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.083
I'M DR. SHEPHERD.

35:24.125 --> 35:27.583
I DID YOUR DAUGHTER'S
NEURO EXAM.

35:33.083 --> 35:34.917
MY WIFE
COULDN'T BE HERE ANYMORE.

35:34.959 --> 35:36.750
MAYBE THAT'S EASIER.

35:36.792 --> 35:38.667
HUH. THERE'S NO EASY.

35:38.709 --> 35:40.583
THERE'S...

35:40.625 --> 35:42.792
THERE'S NO GOOD.

35:42.834 --> 35:45.041
(sighs)
MY FAMILY'S DESTROYED,

35:45.083 --> 35:46.500
AND MISSY IS RESPONSIBLE

35:46.542 --> 35:50.125
FOR MY BABY GIRL
BEING GONE.

35:50.166 --> 35:52.542
HOW DO I DEAL WITH THAT?
HOW...

35:52.583 --> 35:55.333
HOW DO I GO ON?

35:57.125 --> 35:58.542
(sniffles)

35:58.583 --> 36:00.041
(beeping continues)

36:00.083 --> 36:02.000
I DON'T KNOW.

36:03.834 --> 36:06.625
DREA'S LIFE
SHOULD COUNT FOR MORE...

36:06.667 --> 36:09.750
FOR SOMETHING.

36:11.375 --> 36:13.125
(sniffles)

36:13.166 --> 36:17.583
UH, DR. WILDER
SAID SOMETHING ABOUT...

36:17.625 --> 36:20.375
DONATING ORGANS.

36:20.417 --> 36:24.041
(beeping continues)

36:24.083 --> 36:28.000
YOU COULD DO THAT.

36:28.041 --> 36:30.750
SHE COULD DO THAT.

36:30.792 --> 36:32.959
AND THAT WOULD MATTER.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.125
RIGHT?

36:35.166 --> 36:38.041
(beeping continues)

36:38.083 --> 36:41.041
TO A LOT OF PEOPLE...

36:41.083 --> 36:43.834
THAT WOULD MATTER
A GREAT DEAL.

36:46.375 --> 36:50.041
(crying)

37:00.333 --> 37:02.375
YOU TWO GOT
ALL TANGLED UP

37:02.417 --> 37:04.000
IN HERE LAST SESSION.

37:04.041 --> 37:06.333
I'D LIKE TO UNPACK THAT

37:06.375 --> 37:08.458
SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND

37:08.500 --> 37:10.041
WHAT YOU BOTH REALLY WANT
TO COMMUNICATE--

37:10.083 --> 37:12.083
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY.

37:12.125 --> 37:14.875
YOU BOTH THINK THAT
IF WE...

37:14.917 --> 37:17.041
SIT IN OUR MISERY,
IF WE UNPACK IT,

37:17.083 --> 37:19.583
IF WE REEXAMINE EVERY FIGHT
WE'VE EVER HAD,

37:19.625 --> 37:21.625
THAT THAT'S GONNA GET US
SOMEPLACE NEW, IS THAT RIGHT?

37:21.667 --> 37:23.041
NO, THAT'S NOT EXACTLY--

37:23.083 --> 37:24.625
UH, NO, NO, NO,
IT'S NOT EXACT,

37:24.667 --> 37:27.041
BUT THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT.

37:27.083 --> 37:29.083
AND I THINK THE PROBLEM
THAT WE'RE HAVING

37:29.125 --> 37:31.041
IS THAT
I FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREE.

37:31.083 --> 37:32.875
I-I WANT TO HAVE FUN.

37:32.917 --> 37:34.500
YEAH, I WANT TO LAUGH.

37:34.542 --> 37:36.625
I WANNA--I WANT US
TO LOVE EACH OTHER,

37:36.667 --> 37:38.417
BECAUSE WE DO
LOVE EACH OTHER.

37:38.458 --> 37:41.000
AND I THINK THAT IS
MORE IMPORTANT

37:41.041 --> 37:43.333
THAN UNPACKING ALL THE CRAP

37:43.375 --> 37:46.041
THAT WE'VE
BEEN LUGGING AROUND.

37:46.083 --> 37:48.041
SO... LET'S NOT UNPACK IT.

37:48.083 --> 37:49.750
LET'S JUST--

37:49.792 --> 37:52.041
LET'S DROP
THE DAMN SUITCASES.

37:52.083 --> 37:53.333
PETE, YOU CAN'T--

37:53.375 --> 37:54.959
NO. NO, NO, VIOLET,
DON'T ANSWER NOW.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.333
DON'T. I-I KNOW YOU.

37:56.375 --> 37:58.125
I KNOW YOU'LL GET DEFENSIVE
AND YOU'LL MAKE THIS ABOUT

37:58.166 --> 37:59.750
ME SAYING THAT WHAT YOU DO
DOESN'T WORK,

37:59.792 --> 38:01.125
AND THAT ISN'T
WHAT I'M SAYING.

38:01.166 --> 38:03.875
I'M SAYING THAT WHAT YOU DO
ISN'T WHAT I DO.

38:03.917 --> 38:07.041
AND IT'S NOT
WHAT I WANT TO DO.

38:07.083 --> 38:09.750
I JUST WANT TO LOVE YOU.
