00:28.121 --> 00:29.121
Come in.

00:43.681 --> 00:45.881
I have something to tell you...

00:46.641 --> 00:48.321
it's not very good news.

00:49.481 --> 00:50.881
<i>Pietro...</i>

00:55.081 --> 00:57.281
your wife is dead.

00:59.281 --> 01:00.881
I'm sorry.

01:07.241 --> 01:09.641
Do you understand what I said?

01:11.681 --> 01:13.881
Your wife is dead.

03:19.481 --> 03:21.681
FOR MY GENNY

03:49.721 --> 03:52.121
<i>Bruno, it's Manu,
Daniele's girlfriend,</i>

03:52.321 --> 03:54.321
<i>I'm still waiting.</i>

03:56.081 --> 03:58.481
<i>Are you Manu, Daniele's girlfriend?</i>

03:58.681 --> 04:00.681
<i>Are you Bruno, his friend?</i>

04:00.881 --> 04:02.281
<i>Get in.</i>

04:05.161 --> 04:07.441
<i>What happened to Daniele?
Where is he?</i>

04:07.681 --> 04:09.281
<i>That's what you'll tell me.</i>

04:09.481 --> 04:11.081
<i>You're not Bruno.</i>

04:11.281 --> 04:13.681
<i>You're pretty and smart too.</i>

04:14.281 --> 04:15.481
<i>- Let me out!
- Where are you going?</i>

04:15.681 --> 04:18.081
<i>- Let me out!
- Where the fuck's Daniele?</i>

04:18.481 --> 04:22.481
<i>I know how to make you talk, where
the fuck's Daniele? Where is he?</i>

04:38.241 --> 04:42.041
The magistrate released the body,
we can organise the funeral.

04:42.241 --> 04:43.721
At your disposal, Genny.

04:47.001 --> 04:50.401
Trak, tell the florist
it's gotta be the best ever.

04:50.601 --> 04:51.601
Don't worry.

04:56.681 --> 04:59.281
All the old clan members
have to be there,

05:01.081 --> 05:02.961
all of them.

05:06.161 --> 05:08.961
Tell them what time
to be at the cemetery.

05:26.881 --> 05:29.281
Deepest sympathy, Don Gennaro,

05:29.481 --> 05:31.681
the magistrate has signed
the authorisation,

05:31.881 --> 05:35.481
but he's ordered that last respects
be reserved for family members.

05:37.241 --> 05:38.921
Shall we prepare her?

05:41.681 --> 05:43.081
This way.

07:40.681 --> 07:42.081
Gennaro...

07:46.081 --> 07:47.761
Thanks for calling me,

07:47.961 --> 07:50.961
I'm glad to be with you
at this moment.

07:52.081 --> 07:54.081
There are no words.

08:32.081 --> 08:34.681
C'mon, Ciro,
there's room for you too.

09:20.881 --> 09:23.081
Mom's not in there,

09:23.841 --> 09:25.641
nothing's in there,

09:25.841 --> 09:27.841
Mom's gone.

09:29.161 --> 09:30.641
Do you believe in God?

09:33.321 --> 09:36.001
The God who sees all, knows all.

09:41.761 --> 09:43.361
I do.

09:48.281 --> 09:50.681
I believe it's all His design.

09:56.201 --> 10:00.201
When you had me shoot that man
for the first time

10:03.881 --> 10:06.481
and then you covered for me
with my father...

10:07.801 --> 10:10.201
God knew you'd shot him, not me.

10:16.881 --> 10:19.481
When Salvatore Conte came back...

10:24.281 --> 10:26.481
when Danielino died,

10:29.001 --> 10:31.201
He knew it.

10:38.481 --> 10:39.761
He knows everything,

10:40.401 --> 10:43.801
He even knew you and me
would be in this car.

10:44.681 --> 10:47.081
We know what we'd like to do,

10:50.481 --> 10:53.681
but only God knows
how this thing will end.

13:00.281 --> 13:01.681
Counsellor...

13:12.881 --> 13:15.281
I don't see Genny's guys.

14:02.081 --> 14:04.681
- Maria Rita, take my hand.
- Sorry, I'm late.

14:04.881 --> 14:06.081
- C'mon!
- What's the matter?

14:06.281 --> 14:07.281
- Move!
- Wait.

14:07.481 --> 14:09.081
I said: move!

14:09.321 --> 14:10.921
- What's wrong?
- Move.

14:26.281 --> 14:28.281
What's going on, Ciro?

14:32.001 --> 14:34.401
Mamma, it won't all fit in the bag.

14:35.441 --> 14:36.641
Let me see.

14:45.881 --> 14:47.281
See?

14:49.881 --> 14:51.881
Are we waiting for someone?

14:52.081 --> 14:53.361
Nobody.

14:54.481 --> 14:56.881
Daddy, are you coming to the show?

15:02.601 --> 15:04.401
Sure I am.

15:06.881 --> 15:09.681
Who'll be there if not Daddy?

15:25.001 --> 15:27.001
Close those fuckin' bags.

15:27.961 --> 15:30.041
Get moving, hurry!

15:36.081 --> 15:37.481
Fast!

15:41.961 --> 15:43.361
C'mon.

16:20.081 --> 16:22.681
- Go!
- Where is that piece of shit?

16:24.081 --> 16:25.881
Nobody's here.

16:26.081 --> 16:28.481
Let's go, go UP-

16:33.281 --> 16:35.081
Guys. UP-

16:44.081 --> 16:45.681
Go that way!

16:53.881 --> 16:56.281
Hurry up, eyes open!

16:56.881 --> 16:58.881
Look there! Not there?

17:05.401 --> 17:06.881
- He's not there?
- No.

17:07.080 --> 17:08.681
Come here.

17:12.281 --> 17:15.681
- Look down there!
- There they are... I'll kill you!

17:16.481 --> 17:18.281
Fuckin' son of a bitch!

17:18.481 --> 17:21.080
Ciro, you're a dead man!

17:21.320 --> 17:24.521
I'll shoot you here, I'll kill you!

17:32.681 --> 17:34.081
Little Baron...

17:39.081 --> 17:40.681
Go!

18:48.881 --> 18:50.481
Go get in the car.

18:50.681 --> 18:53.161
Get in the car!

19:00.721 --> 19:03.201
Hurry, in the car!

19:07.481 --> 19:08.361
Get in!

19:08.561 --> 19:10.161
Shut it!

19:12.041 --> 19:13.321
Don't be scared.

19:17.681 --> 19:19.281
Get in!

19:27.081 --> 19:28.161
Get in!

20:43.241 --> 20:45.041
Where are you goin' , Ma'am?

20:45.241 --> 20:47.041
You gotta wait.

20:57.681 --> 20:59.081
I'll close it.

20:59.281 --> 21:01.481
- Will you let me in now?
- Wait.

21:01.681 --> 21:04.361
- I have to make lunch!
- Wait a second.

21:04.601 --> 21:07.601
Guns down, there are kids. C'mon!

21:08.561 --> 21:10.561
Ciro and Umberto, wait here.

21:17.561 --> 21:19.561
GUYS. eyes open!

21:32.201 --> 21:33.801
Spread the word:

21:35.681 --> 21:39.881
If you know where Ciro di Marzio is,
you get 150,000 euros.

21:40.081 --> 21:42.681
Genny, we gotta take care
of Conte too,

21:42.921 --> 21:45.601
there's Ciro
and Conte with his men.

21:45.801 --> 21:49.081
Salvatore Conte
can suck my dick, okay?

21:52.441 --> 21:56.441
There are millions of us, we have
all the young guys, even the kids,

21:57.241 --> 21:59.241
you'll see
what we do here in Naples!

21:59.441 --> 22:04.041
But we don't know
how many are switching sides.

22:04.881 --> 22:08.081
- We can't know that.
- So, what's the problem?

22:09.841 --> 22:12.521
We'll kill them
and all those idiots with them.

22:16.961 --> 22:20.761
There's no peace
till we find Ciro, okay?

22:49.721 --> 22:51.721
Now what happens?

22:51.921 --> 22:55.121
I'm leaving you with Enzo,
he'll take care of you.

23:00.681 --> 23:02.681
Come here, sweetie.

23:07.681 --> 23:10.081
Daddy, I'm scared.

23:12.761 --> 23:16.361
Don't be, Daddy will
take care of everything.

23:17.681 --> 23:19.481
Don't worry.

23:23.681 --> 23:25.281
Go to Mom.

23:34.761 --> 23:36.041
Come here!

23:36.241 --> 23:38.641
Goddammit, come here!

23:41.881 --> 23:43.481
You bastard.

23:59.681 --> 24:01.481
Do a line.

24:12.681 --> 24:14.281
Who's there?

24:15.441 --> 24:16.521
Who's there?

24:20.561 --> 24:22.561
What's going on?

24:22.841 --> 24:24.641
Who's there?

24:25.241 --> 24:27.041
What happened?

24:27.881 --> 24:29.881
Open real slow.

24:33.281 --> 24:35.081
What is it?

24:40.081 --> 24:42.481
- It was a dog.
- You killed it?

24:42.681 --> 24:44.561
Neymar!

24:45.721 --> 24:47.721
Diego, stop!

24:47.921 --> 24:49.321
Stop, where are you going?

24:49.561 --> 24:51.961
Neymar! No!

24:55.881 --> 24:57.281
Get inside!

24:57.481 --> 24:59.961
You can't do anything.
Get inside, I said!

25:00.161 --> 25:03.561
Want to end up like your dog?
Get inside!

25:24.681 --> 25:26.081
Can I give you a hand?

25:26.281 --> 25:29.081
- Don't bother, I'm fine.
- It's no bother.

25:31.681 --> 25:34.281
I'm sorry for what happened.

25:36.081 --> 25:38.881
His father gave him the dog,

25:39.281 --> 25:42.281
he passed away six months ago.

25:42.481 --> 25:44.081
I heard,

25:44.881 --> 25:47.081
that's why I'm even sorrier.

25:49.081 --> 25:51.081
I bought him a video game.

25:51.281 --> 25:54.081
- I really can't accept.
- Why not?

26:03.681 --> 26:05.281
Thank you.

26:06.881 --> 26:10.961
Tell him I'll wait for him,
for us to play a game together.

26:22.681 --> 26:24.281
What is it?

26:28.081 --> 26:29.881
It's for you.

26:31.641 --> 26:35.721
He's sorry about the dog
so he bought you this gift.

26:57.081 --> 26:58.681
Diego, look at me.

26:58.881 --> 27:02.881
Those people are dangerous,
stay away from them.

27:03.081 --> 27:06.081
I know who they are,
that guy's a boss.

27:07.281 --> 27:10.281
Whoever he is,
just stay away from them.

27:21.481 --> 27:24.481
Salvatore Conte's in Via Baku],
he's very nervous.

27:25.681 --> 27:27.681
Malamore's gone

27:28.481 --> 27:31.281
and Genny Savastano
is holed up in the Sails.

27:31.481 --> 27:33.881
His guys are furious,

27:34.761 --> 27:36.761
they're after us.

27:47.081 --> 27:48.481
Don't worry,

27:49.841 --> 27:52.121
first I must talk to Conte

27:52.321 --> 27:54.321
and then we give them want they want.

28:52.681 --> 28:54.481
He's here!

29:02.041 --> 29:04.721
Didn't you say
the Savastanos were history?

29:07.241 --> 29:09.641
Look at us now.

29:10.761 --> 29:14.161
I think you underestimated
our little Genny

29:14.881 --> 29:17.281
and now you're the only one left.

29:18.641 --> 29:21.121
Little Genny and his guys
have wiped everybody out.

29:21.321 --> 29:23.121
They're nobodies,

29:23.641 --> 29:25.241
they're walking dead men.

29:26.281 --> 29:29.681
If you'll listen to me,
we'll wipe them all out.

29:29.881 --> 29:32.681
This guy's got balls,

29:32.881 --> 29:34.681
he's the boss.

29:37.681 --> 29:39.081
Ciro,

29:41.281 --> 29:45.081
every baker,
every grocer, every milkman,

29:45.281 --> 29:47.881
from here to Melito
is looking for you.

29:48.121 --> 29:51.401
And there's 150,000 bucks
for the one who <i>says</i> where you are.

29:53.281 --> 29:56.081
You and me have nothing more
to say to each other.

29:56.681 --> 29:59.681
Get some plastic,
I don't want to dirty the floor.

30:01.881 --> 30:03.961
Then why did you come back?

30:08.281 --> 30:10.561
You knew it was me
who killed Tonino Russo.

30:15.361 --> 30:18.241
And that the old group
weren't happy with Gennaro.

30:22.361 --> 30:25.761
You're here because
you wanted this war too.

30:30.881 --> 30:33.081
Because this is your house

30:34.081 --> 30:36.281
and only dogs let themselves
get kicked in the ass.

30:36.481 --> 30:38.481
I'm gonna cut your head off

30:39.121 --> 30:41.601
and take it to Little Genny,

30:41.841 --> 30:44.921
I'll make peace
and get back what was mine.

30:45.161 --> 30:47.641
Then I'll go back to Spain,

30:47.841 --> 30:49.841
what do you say, you shit?

30:50.481 --> 30:53.481
I say you want
Gennaro Savastano's head

30:54.281 --> 30:56.481
and only I can give it to you.

31:04.121 --> 31:06.601
I have a message
for Gennaro Savastano.

31:06.801 --> 31:07.881
You can tell me.

31:17.521 --> 31:20.921
My daughter Letizia
sings in a chorus,

31:21.121 --> 31:23.601
today's their end-of-school recital

31:23.801 --> 31:28.281
and the daughter of the one you want
sings in that chorus too,

31:28.881 --> 31:30.881
Ciro di Marzio.

31:31.641 --> 31:35.041
I heard there's a reward.

31:45.881 --> 31:46.961
SQ,

31:48.361 --> 31:50.641
just me and the kid
go into the theater,

31:50.881 --> 31:53.481
because it's a kids' school recital,

31:53.681 --> 31:55.761
and if we all went in, it'd be chaos.

31:56.001 --> 31:59.401
Okay, but why not let me come too?

32:00.561 --> 32:03.041
I want to kill that rat Ciro too.

32:03.241 --> 32:07.041
No, you wait outside,
if he comes out, you shoot him.

32:08.801 --> 32:12.001
Then we go to Salvatore Conte
and fuck his ass,

32:12.201 --> 32:15.681
his and all the ones with him, okay?

32:18.601 --> 32:21.401
We're the strongest,

32:21.561 --> 32:22.961
us!

32:26.601 --> 32:28.001
Let's go!

32:28.881 --> 32:30.481
C'mon!

32:30.681 --> 32:32.081
Let's go!

33:06.881 --> 33:08.481
Hi, Diego.

33:09.481 --> 33:10.881
Hi.

33:15.321 --> 33:17.601
You're already at the third level?

33:17.801 --> 33:19.601
So you're really good.

33:23.161 --> 33:27.761
I knew you're a sharp kid,
aren't you?

33:28.281 --> 33:30.081
Yeah, I think so.

34:01.761 --> 34:03.161
Diego!

34:15.481 --> 34:17.161
Come here.

34:17.681 --> 34:19.481
See who's here?

34:22.880 --> 34:26.960
I don't care who you are,
leave my kid alone.

34:27.880 --> 34:31.281
Don't worry, we're running an errand,
we'll be back, right?

34:32.041 --> 34:36.241
We're going to see a show
with children singing.

34:37.481 --> 34:38.681
Good kid.

34:38.880 --> 34:40.960
- Out of the way.
- Leave my house!

35:08.721 --> 35:10.921
Are you coming with me
or staying with your Mom?

35:11.121 --> 35:13.801
- I'll be back soon.
- Where are you going?

35:14.001 --> 35:15.361
Stay here, hear me?

35:15.561 --> 35:16.841
Diego, come here!

35:17.041 --> 35:19.241
Damn <i>it...</i> move over!

35:19.441 --> 35:23.441
I'll beat you to death
when you get back, hear me?

35:23.681 --> 35:24.881
Get out of the way!

36:05.281 --> 36:07.081
Bro'!

36:23.681 --> 36:25.881
Now what happens?

36:26.481 --> 36:28.681
I gotta settle an old score.

36:31.361 --> 36:32.761
What score?

36:39.081 --> 36:41.281
If I betray you,

36:42.281 --> 36:44.681
you who really loves me

36:44.881 --> 36:46.881
but I don't love you at all

36:47.081 --> 36:49.281
and I think
you're just a poor fool...

36:53.121 --> 36:55.521
If I kill your Mom,

36:55.761 --> 36:58.761
just because she tried
to protect you from me,

37:00.681 --> 37:02.681
what would you do?

37:04.281 --> 37:06.281
I'd kill you.

37:10.241 --> 37:11.641
Good kid.

37:14.841 --> 37:19.241
I'll teach you everything,
make you a big man,

37:20.161 --> 37:22.561
but you have to promise one thing:

37:23.721 --> 37:26.601
never trust anyone, ever,

37:29.601 --> 37:31.401
not even me.

37:47.481 --> 37:50.081
He's not here, Genny's not here.

37:59.281 --> 38:01.081
Where is he?

38:02.841 --> 38:04.241
Where the fuck is he?

38:22.481 --> 38:24.881
- I have to answer.
- Go.

38:37.321 --> 38:39.121
- Hello.
- Hello.

38:39.321 --> 38:41.721
We're late, the boy's in the show.

38:43.481 --> 38:44.881
Go on in.

38:45.881 --> 38:49.081
<i>It's a fuckin' bust,
they were all there but him.</i>

38:56.281 --> 38:58.681
- Go get Maria Rita!
- What's wrong?

38:58.881 --> 39:00.481
- Go get her.
- Tell me.

39:00.681 --> 39:02.081
Fast!

39:03.961 --> 39:05.961
- But what about you?
- Go!

39:16.961 --> 39:20.641
- Get my daughter off stage, fast.
- How can I?

39:31.481 --> 39:33.281
Wait here.

40:02.961 --> 40:04.641
<i>Excuse me...</i>

40:47.681 --> 40:49.281
Deborah!

40:50.641 --> 40:51.641
Come on.

41:04.201 --> 41:08.081
You knew it and used
your daughter and me <i>as</i> bait.

41:08.281 --> 41:09.681
Keep walking.

41:10.241 --> 41:13.641
You shoot at a kids' chorus?
You're going crazy!

41:13.841 --> 41:16.041
We'll talk later, get in the car.

41:16.241 --> 41:18.441
- I'm not doing what you say anymore.
- Get in!

41:18.641 --> 41:20.641
- I'm leaving!
- Deborah!

41:35.081 --> 41:37.281
Gennaro Savastano is dead.

41:37.481 --> 41:39.361
Now only Don Pietro's left.

41:42.161 --> 41:45.361
Savastano, it's transfer time.
