[theme music]

00:46.680 --> 00:50.084
(LAUGHING)

00:57.658 --> 00:59.059
Strike!

00:59.160 --> 01:00.528
Too high!

01:00.628 --> 01:01.995
That's because
you're a midget.

01:02.096 --> 01:04.498
Come on, Darlene, bear down.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.667
Bear down.

01:06.767 --> 01:10.037
Strike two!

01:10.138 --> 01:11.071
Too low!

01:11.172 --> 01:12.072
Low?
Low?

01:12.173 --> 01:13.040
Are you blind?

01:13.141 --> 01:14.041
Are you drunk?

01:14.142 --> 01:15.243
Are you crazy?

01:15.343 --> 01:16.144
Get your popcorn!

01:16.244 --> 01:17.678
Get your peanuts!

01:17.778 --> 01:22.883
Get your butt over here and
help me with these damn bags!

01:22.983 --> 01:26.220
Babe, our daughter's on
her way to the Hall of Fame.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.755
Well, on your
way to Cooperstown,

01:27.855 --> 01:30.424
drop them off in the kitchen.

01:30.524 --> 01:33.594
Mom, do you think boobs
will affect my pitching?

01:33.694 --> 01:34.928
Not this season.

01:43.036 --> 01:45.306
Great to be alive, isn't it?

01:45.406 --> 01:46.574
Well, I wouldn't know.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.579
I just spent two hours in the
supermarket with one of them

01:51.679 --> 01:54.548
carts that only makes
left hand turns.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.384
Well, this ought to
straighten you out.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.390
Feel better?

02:02.490 --> 02:06.594
Well, it wasn't as good as
the checkout boy, but it'll do.

02:06.694 --> 02:09.430
OK, Johnny, see you
tomorrow night at 9:00.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.064
Yeah, Johnny, tomorrow at 9:00.

02:15.369 --> 02:16.170
Hi, Mom.

02:16.270 --> 02:17.205
Hi, Dad.

02:17.305 --> 02:18.406
What did you do?

02:18.506 --> 02:20.374
Can't a girl say hi to
her parents without being

02:20.474 --> 02:22.376
treated like a suspect?

02:22.476 --> 02:23.477
No.

02:23.577 --> 02:24.378
Wine?

02:24.478 --> 02:25.746
Candles?

02:25.846 --> 02:26.647
You cheated!

02:26.747 --> 02:27.548
You read the labels!

02:31.252 --> 02:32.052
All right, bub.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.922
You must want something.

02:35.022 --> 02:36.490
I want you to
put a leaf in here,

02:36.590 --> 02:38.426
because we're having a
company Friday night.

02:38.526 --> 02:41.495
I invited Chip and his
parents for dinner.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.331
How could you do that?

02:43.431 --> 02:46.200
Because I ran into Chip's
mom in the supermarket

02:46.300 --> 02:49.937
and she puts a gun to my
head, so I invited her.

02:50.037 --> 02:51.705
Becky, you've been
squawking for months for us

02:51.805 --> 02:52.773
to have them over.

02:52.873 --> 02:54.174
You should be happy.

02:54.275 --> 02:55.543
I am happy.

02:55.643 --> 02:57.110
So what's your problem?

02:57.211 --> 02:58.111
Nothing.

02:58.212 --> 02:59.747
I just have a lot
of studying to do.

02:59.847 --> 03:00.981
On Friday night?

03:01.081 --> 03:02.416
Yes, on Friday night.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.851
(FRENCH ACCENT) That's
our busiest night.

03:08.589 --> 03:09.890
What's that?

03:09.990 --> 03:11.091
What?

03:11.191 --> 03:13.561
That lightning bolt you
got hanging off your face.

03:13.661 --> 03:16.063
What did you do,
pierce your ear again?

03:16.163 --> 03:17.465
Yeah.

03:17.565 --> 03:18.699
How many holes in
your head does it

03:18.799 --> 03:21.835
take to be accepted these days?

03:21.935 --> 03:23.404
Six.

03:23.504 --> 03:26.039
Well, three more and I'll
use you to drain my spaghetti.

03:35.849 --> 03:39.186
Do I have to get dressed
up for this boring dinner?

03:39.287 --> 03:40.721
No, we're all dining naked.

03:42.790 --> 03:43.591
Again?

03:46.260 --> 03:48.829
Hey, I thought you were going
to clear this table off for me.

03:48.929 --> 03:50.097
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

03:50.197 --> 03:52.132
I was just goofing around
cooking dinner for eight.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.538
Sis, are you sure
you won't stay?

03:57.638 --> 03:59.707
No, I've got a
date with Booker.

03:59.807 --> 04:00.874
Well, bring him.

04:00.974 --> 04:02.075
No way!

04:02.175 --> 04:04.011
I finally got him to take
me to a restaurant that

04:04.111 --> 04:07.548
doesn't have napkin dispensers.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.450
What are you doing with that?

04:09.550 --> 04:10.651
I'm marinating the swordfish.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.320
Yuppies marinate everything.

04:12.420 --> 04:15.356
Well, then, I guess Bonnie
and Edgar ought to love it.

04:15.456 --> 04:17.691
Edgar?
Chip's father's name is Edgar?

04:17.791 --> 04:19.059
Yeah.

04:19.159 --> 04:21.128
I don't believe I've ever
supped with an Edgar before.

04:24.765 --> 04:25.833
Well, it's the
least we can do.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.268
They've taken Becky out a
million times, you know?

04:28.369 --> 04:30.438
To some really nice places.

04:30.538 --> 04:32.272
So you're squaring
the deal by serving them

04:32.373 --> 04:34.808
my famous marinated swordfish?

04:34.908 --> 04:36.510
Well, you never know, Sis.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.546
Bonnie and Edgar could
be family someday.

04:40.213 --> 04:42.550
Roseanne, Chip and Becky
are only in the eighth grade.

04:42.650 --> 04:45.018
Well, they've been
going together six months.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.554
That's pretty much
longer than you've ever

04:46.654 --> 04:47.855
gone out with anyone, isn't it?

04:51.325 --> 04:52.626
Are they here yet?

04:52.726 --> 04:54.194
Yes, I believe
Asquith has shown them

04:54.294 --> 04:55.429
into the study,
where they're sipping

04:55.529 --> 04:58.766
absinthe and playing billiards.

04:58.866 --> 05:01.001
Should I put out
the good dishes?

05:01.101 --> 05:03.571
Nah, let's just go ahead
and break down these paper

05:03.671 --> 05:05.973
plates with divisions.

05:06.073 --> 05:09.777
I'll put out the good dishes.

05:09.877 --> 05:11.144
(DISGUSTED) Ugh!

05:11.244 --> 05:13.747
What smells like fish?

05:13.847 --> 05:16.049
Fish.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.685
What time did you
tell them to be here?

05:17.785 --> 05:19.086
Becky, chill out.

05:19.186 --> 05:21.288
They will be here
when they get here.

05:21.389 --> 05:22.189
This is great.

05:22.289 --> 05:24.392
Now I got to eat
this stupid fish

05:24.492 --> 05:26.193
and wear this stupid dress.

05:26.293 --> 05:29.930
And then you're going
to do the stupid dishes.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.900
Well, I do believe that
my work here is done.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.869
Lady Connor, you're dismissing
the help for the evening?

05:35.969 --> 05:40.841
I'd stay but my French maid
costume is at the cleaners.

05:40.941 --> 05:44.778
[speaking fake french]

05:44.878 --> 05:46.647
Remember to sprinkle a
little garlic salt on the fish

05:46.747 --> 05:47.881
before you put it in the oven.

05:47.981 --> 05:48.949
OK, I will.

05:49.049 --> 05:50.451
Good luck.

05:50.551 --> 05:51.952
- Thanks.
- Thanks, Sis.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.086
See you tomorrow.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.288
You know, they have to
be out of here by 9:00.

05:55.389 --> 05:57.825
I have to start
studying by 9 o'clock.

05:57.925 --> 06:00.160
What exactly is it
that you're studying?

06:00.260 --> 06:01.094
Nothing.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.129
[doorbell rings]

06:02.229 --> 06:03.030
Finally!

06:04.264 --> 06:06.333
Becky, relax.
Everything's going to be fine.

06:06.434 --> 06:08.301
Your father and I are
not going to embarrass you.

06:08.402 --> 06:09.202
Right.

06:09.302 --> 06:10.137
I'll get the door.

06:10.237 --> 06:13.474
You get the orgy lamp.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.075
Lady Darlene, the
guests have arrived.

06:15.175 --> 06:18.311
Get your feet off the couch.

06:18.412 --> 06:19.212
Ha-ha!

06:25.252 --> 06:26.253
Think you're funny, chum?

06:26.353 --> 06:28.689
Uh-huh.

06:28.789 --> 06:31.692
Well, let's just unfunny
you up a little bit.

06:31.792 --> 06:35.395
Let's just shake some of
that wise guy out of you.

06:35.496 --> 06:38.799
[dj giggling]

06:38.899 --> 06:41.268
Hey, Mr. Connor.

06:41.368 --> 06:44.304
Hey, Chip, how's it going?

06:44.404 --> 06:45.272
Hi, Chip!

06:45.372 --> 06:46.239
Hey, DJ.

06:46.339 --> 06:47.140
It's OK.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.009
This is normal.

06:49.109 --> 06:50.277
Hiya, Bonnie.

06:50.377 --> 06:51.278
How you doing, Roseanne?

06:51.378 --> 06:53.581
Well, my feet
hurt and I've got

06:53.681 --> 06:55.148
periodic bouts of depression.

06:55.248 --> 06:58.218
But other than that, I'm fine.

06:58.318 --> 06:59.252
[interposing voices]

06:59.352 --> 07:00.353
Hey, handsome.

07:00.454 --> 07:02.890
Dan, Roseanne, this
is my husband, Edgar.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.858
Hi, Edgar, good to know you.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.927
This is the rest of
our stunning brood.

07:07.027 --> 07:07.961
DJ, Darlene.

07:08.061 --> 07:08.862
Hi.

07:08.962 --> 07:09.763
EDGAR: Hello.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.632
Guess we're ready to eat.

07:11.732 --> 07:15.836
I think maybe they'd like
to take their coats off first.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.571
Thank you.

07:17.671 --> 07:18.939
Here, you guys.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.408
Check these for loose change
and then throw them on my bed.

07:24.044 --> 07:24.845
DARLENE: OK, Mom.

07:24.945 --> 07:25.846
DJ: OK, Mom.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.682
DARLENE: Shut up, pinhead.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.984
Precious, ain't they?

07:31.084 --> 07:32.085
Here, these are for you.

07:32.185 --> 07:33.353
Thanks.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.455
I'll go put them in water
real quick so we can eat.

07:35.556 --> 07:36.757
Anybody care for a drink?

07:36.857 --> 07:37.658
You bet.

07:37.758 --> 07:38.992
My kind of gal.

07:39.092 --> 07:41.128
Just mineral water.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.696
Well, we've got water.

07:42.796 --> 07:46.800
And I'm sure it's
got minerals in it.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.101
Edgar?

07:48.201 --> 07:49.169
Should I be bad?

07:49.269 --> 07:50.037
Why not?

07:50.137 --> 07:51.905
You jogged this morning.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.507
What the heck.

07:53.607 --> 07:55.275
I'll have a tropical hurricane.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.716
I can get you a cold
beer and turn on a fan.

08:09.790 --> 08:10.991
Beer's fine.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.192
Babe?

08:12.292 --> 08:13.861
I'll have some
of that Muscatel

08:13.961 --> 08:16.797
in the door of the fridge.

08:16.897 --> 08:17.831
Chipster, the usual?

08:17.931 --> 08:18.832
Yeah, thanks.

08:18.932 --> 08:19.733
Why don't we sit down?

08:27.440 --> 08:28.475
Oh, here.

08:28.576 --> 08:30.578
I know you two want to
sit next to each other.

08:30.678 --> 08:31.478
Thanks.

08:42.455 --> 08:44.391
Interesting picture.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.098
Yeah, it used to be
a postcard and then

08:51.198 --> 08:54.735
we had 100 paintings run off.

08:54.835 --> 08:55.969
I told you she was a pistol.

08:56.069 --> 08:56.904
Of

08:57.004 --> 08:57.805
Mom?

08:57.905 --> 08:58.706
Mom?

08:58.806 --> 09:00.073
What is it, Darlene?

09:00.173 --> 09:02.109
Well, there was
laundry in your bed,

09:02.209 --> 09:05.078
so I put the coats
on your chair.

09:05.178 --> 09:06.914
I hope my beeper
didn't fall out.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.816
I was perfectly willing
to put it in my purse.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.283
Well, your purse
is in the car.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.284
And the car is locked.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.519
And the alarm is not working.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.087
Oh, just smack her, Edgar.

09:23.697 --> 09:24.932
I'm really getting hungry.

09:25.032 --> 09:26.033
Well, have a drink at the bar.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.601
We'll let you know when
your table is ready.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.002
Mommy?

09:29.102 --> 09:29.903
Daddy.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.078
So.

09:38.178 --> 09:38.979
So.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.280
I'm so glad we did this.

09:40.380 --> 09:41.181
ROSEANNE: Uh-huh.

09:51.558 --> 09:54.895
So, Dan, Bonnie tells
me you're a contractor.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.129
Bonnie speaks the truth.

09:56.229 --> 09:58.465
Well, you know I do a
bit of digging myself.

09:58.565 --> 09:59.366
I'm a dentist.

10:02.803 --> 10:03.603
Everybody rinse!

10:09.142 --> 10:11.344
Yeah, we go to that
Dr. Sternberg over there

10:11.444 --> 10:12.780
on Oakhurst.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.147
Oh, sure, we know Mark.

10:17.384 --> 10:20.120
He's real good.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.889
We like him a lot.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.090
But he's not an
Oakhurst anymore.

10:23.190 --> 10:24.257
Is that right?

10:24.357 --> 10:26.727
Right, he's in that
new professional building

10:26.827 --> 10:28.729
over on Sheridan.

10:28.829 --> 10:31.699
They must have moved.

10:31.799 --> 10:35.803
Yeah, he shared space
with Kehoe Pamer and--

10:35.903 --> 10:37.771
you know, the fellow
who had the thing.

10:37.871 --> 10:39.372
You know, the one
who knows Barbara.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.340
Lidecker.

10:40.440 --> 10:44.244
Right, Kehoe
Pamer and Lidecker.

10:44.344 --> 10:47.514
They all share that professional
building over in Sheridan.

10:47.614 --> 10:49.082
My friend Karen decorated it.

10:49.182 --> 10:50.350
My friend Rocco
poured the driveway.

10:53.887 --> 10:56.957
Jeez, talk about
a small world, huh?

10:57.057 --> 10:58.391
Jeez.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.292
Jeez.

11:04.597 --> 11:06.499
Got an ETA out
on that fish, babe?

11:06.599 --> 11:07.400
Soon.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.836
How soon?

11:08.936 --> 11:10.103
I'll check with the cook.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.842
Becky, you doing
anything tomorrow night?

11:14.942 --> 11:15.976
Why?

11:16.076 --> 11:18.311
I thought we could go
see "Bloodthirsty 2".

11:18.411 --> 11:19.212
Tomorrow night?

11:19.312 --> 11:21.014
Yeah.

11:21.114 --> 11:23.116
It didn't get
very good reviews.

11:23.216 --> 11:24.718
Well, neither did
a "Bloodthirsty 1",

11:24.818 --> 11:27.888
but you saw that 14 times."

11:27.988 --> 11:29.289
OK, I'll go.

11:29.389 --> 11:33.193
I hear during the prom
scene, they use a human liver.

11:33.293 --> 11:34.962
Oh, well, everybody
ready to eat?

11:35.062 --> 11:37.564
BECKY: Yes.

11:37.664 --> 11:39.066
Good, I just
turned the oven on,

11:39.166 --> 11:40.667
so it'll cook a lot
faster that way.

11:53.781 --> 11:56.784
More than a week in
Hawaii will drive you crazy.

11:56.884 --> 11:59.887
Everybody says aloha!

11:59.987 --> 12:01.288
That's all they ever say!

12:01.388 --> 12:03.056
Aloha this, aloha that.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.361
It means hello,
it means goodbye.

12:08.461 --> 12:09.529
What else does it mean, honey?

12:09.629 --> 12:11.231
I know it means love.

12:11.331 --> 12:14.868
I think it means
potholder, too.

12:14.968 --> 12:18.939
Tell them about
our guide, honey.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.007
Oh, Dan, Dan!

12:20.107 --> 12:21.574
You've got to hear this.

12:21.674 --> 12:23.176
Roseanne, this is wonderful.

12:23.276 --> 12:25.678
A publisher friend of
ours swears it's a book.

12:25.779 --> 12:27.447
Well, just give
us the cliff notes?

12:30.283 --> 12:32.185
Why don't we order in a pizza?

12:32.285 --> 12:33.686
No, it's time.

12:33.787 --> 12:35.422
Need any help out there
in the kitchen, babe?

12:35.522 --> 12:37.624
Oh, that's so sweet
of you to offer, honey.

12:37.724 --> 12:38.859
But you just stay here.

12:38.959 --> 12:39.759
Aloha.

12:44.164 --> 12:47.801
Our guide's name
was Michael Ho.

12:47.901 --> 12:51.204
Of course his Hawaiian
name was Mikahila.

12:51.304 --> 12:53.073
Ah, yes.

12:53.173 --> 12:53.974
Mikahila Ho.

12:58.545 --> 13:04.084
Um, did you know that when
swordfish cooks, it shrinks?

13:04.184 --> 13:07.821
And of course when it's burned,
it practically disappears.

13:12.860 --> 13:18.198
Oh, for crying out loud,
honey, let's just eat it burnt!

13:18.298 --> 13:19.366
Burned?

13:19.466 --> 13:22.102
I can have hamburgers
in 10 minutes.

13:22.202 --> 13:24.504
20, if you want them cooked.

13:24.604 --> 13:25.873
Hamburgers are fine.

13:25.973 --> 13:29.242
This will be our red meat day.

13:29.342 --> 13:31.979
We could have had
hamburgers an hour ago.

13:32.079 --> 13:34.581
I hate this house!

13:34.681 --> 13:36.816
Tell Becky I need
her to help me.

13:36.917 --> 13:37.851
She's not up there.

13:37.951 --> 13:38.986
Where is she?

13:39.086 --> 13:41.821
Well, if she's smart,
she went out to dinner.

13:41.922 --> 13:42.956
Quiet, you.

13:43.056 --> 13:43.924
(SHRILL) Becky!

13:47.895 --> 13:49.462
Nice going, Beck.

13:49.562 --> 13:50.864
You got out of the house.

13:50.964 --> 13:53.400
The hard part is over.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.334
Sorry you can't come in.

13:54.434 --> 13:55.635
My parents have people over.

13:55.735 --> 13:57.070
No prob.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.506
Hey, listen, want to go
to a party tomorrow night?

13:59.606 --> 14:01.341
Yeah, that'd be great.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.110
Cool, I'll pick
you up at 7:00.

14:03.210 --> 14:04.477
BECKY: 7:00 is great, Johnny.

14:04.577 --> 14:06.213
Think it'll be cool
with your parents?

14:06.313 --> 14:07.747
My parents are very cool.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.549
They don't tell me what to do.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.818
Cool.

14:11.919 --> 14:14.287
Becky, get your
butt in the house now!

14:20.460 --> 14:21.261
Mother?

14:21.361 --> 14:22.162
Now.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.538
Roseanne Conner.

14:31.638 --> 14:32.872
Nice to meet you.

14:36.843 --> 14:38.411
So how long is
Becky grounded for?

14:38.511 --> 14:39.646
What did she do?

14:39.746 --> 14:42.983
She forgot to gag
Darlene like I told her.

14:43.083 --> 14:45.418
She snuck out last night
to meet the make out king.

14:48.488 --> 14:51.691
Chip's the make out king?

14:51.791 --> 14:54.594
Forget Chip, he's old news.

14:54.694 --> 14:58.831
Darling, why don't you
use your mouth to eat?

14:58.932 --> 14:59.799
Who is the make out king?

14:59.899 --> 15:00.667
You are, honey.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.639
Johnny Swanko,
he's a sophomore.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.476
Well, he kisses like a senior.

15:09.576 --> 15:10.877
I get the feeling
I'm not totally filled

15:10.978 --> 15:14.014
in on everything around here.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.349
Becky's got something
going with another guy.

15:16.449 --> 15:17.817
What kind of thing?

15:17.917 --> 15:20.387
I don't know, Dan, but I
caught them out by the garage

15:20.487 --> 15:22.189
last night.

15:22.289 --> 15:23.723
Why didn't you tell me?

15:23.823 --> 15:25.792
Because there's lots of
stuff I don't tell you, honey.

15:25.892 --> 15:28.161
That's the glue that keeps
our little family together.

15:32.499 --> 15:33.833
(MOCKINGLY) Oh, Johnny!
Oh, Johnny!

15:33.933 --> 15:34.734
Oh, Johnny!

15:34.834 --> 15:36.769
Oh, Johnny!

15:36.869 --> 15:39.806
I want to hear more
about this Johnny.

15:39.906 --> 15:42.575
Well, he wears a
black studded belt

15:42.675 --> 15:44.911
and they call him
the Tongue Bandit.

15:48.148 --> 15:49.949
Darlene, why don't
you leave and come

15:50.050 --> 15:53.453
back when you're about 40?

15:53.553 --> 15:55.455
OK, great, I'll
go over to Johnny's.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.157
DJ: Great, I'll go
over to Johnny's!

15:57.257 --> 15:58.791
Drop dead.

15:58.891 --> 16:01.061
So I thought chip was
Becky's main squeeze.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.663
Well, I guess when you're 13,
you need more than one squeeze.

16:09.236 --> 16:11.038
I just want to say that
what you did to me last night

16:11.138 --> 16:12.472
was totally uncool.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.874
And if I were your mother, I
would never do that to you.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.144
Well, do me a favor
and enlighten me.

16:17.244 --> 16:18.245
Mother, let's just drop it.

16:18.345 --> 16:19.146
No, no, no.

16:19.246 --> 16:20.047
I want to know.

16:20.147 --> 16:22.049
What's your definition of cool?

16:22.149 --> 16:23.750
Is that to make a date
with chip and then

16:23.850 --> 16:25.218
turn around and make
a date for the very

16:25.318 --> 16:28.388
same night with Johnny Angel

16:28.488 --> 16:29.956
His name is Johnny Swanko.

16:30.057 --> 16:31.724
Whatever.

16:31.824 --> 16:32.959
Come on, just
answer my question.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.527
It's none of your business.

16:34.627 --> 16:37.264
It is my business when you
start snaking out of this house

16:37.364 --> 16:38.765
to meet some guy
that I would consider

16:38.865 --> 16:39.932
leaving your father for!

16:50.810 --> 16:52.679
You know, Becky,
what you did is going

16:52.779 --> 16:58.185
to make it to Zit Magazine's
10 Most Vicious Teens.

16:58.285 --> 17:00.253
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.821
Well, are you
dating Chip or not?

17:01.921 --> 17:03.156
Yeah, I still like Chip.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.957
Well, how would you like it
if Chip met some other girl

17:05.058 --> 17:05.958
in his driveway?

17:06.059 --> 17:07.694
Hey, Chip can do
whatever he wants.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.062
I don't care.

17:09.162 --> 17:11.131
Well, I'll remember that when
you're sitting there crying

17:11.231 --> 17:13.666
your eyes out because Chip
sat next to some other girl

17:13.766 --> 17:15.034
on the bus.

17:15.135 --> 17:16.903
Becky, why didn't you tell
us all this before we invited

17:17.003 --> 17:19.839
the Lunts over to dinner?

17:19.939 --> 17:21.874
Because Mom had
already invited them.

17:21.974 --> 17:23.042
Plus you guys love Chip.

17:23.143 --> 17:24.711
Plus if you knew I was
going out with Johnny,

17:24.811 --> 17:25.812
you would've freaked!

17:25.912 --> 17:27.380
There's no way you'd
let me go out with him.

17:27.480 --> 17:28.515
You got that right.

17:28.615 --> 17:29.782
I want you to get on the phone.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.552
You call the Tongue
Bandit and you

17:32.652 --> 17:33.953
tell him you ain't
going nowhere tonight,

17:34.053 --> 17:35.188
not even out to the garage.

17:35.288 --> 17:36.423
Hey, it's my life.

17:36.523 --> 17:37.390
Why don't you just butt out!

17:37.490 --> 17:38.558
Becky, we're just
trying to teach

17:38.658 --> 17:39.859
you how to do the right thing.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.928
You guys are real
hypocrites, you know that?

17:42.028 --> 17:43.296
I mean, you're always
saying how you're

17:43.396 --> 17:46.799
the coolest, hippest, most with
it parents, but you're not.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.235
You're just like
everyone else's parents.

17:48.335 --> 17:49.136
You're bogus!

17:52.239 --> 17:53.206
Hi, Dan Bogus.

17:58.044 --> 18:00.680
Roseanne Hypocrite
Bogus, so nice meet you.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.782
I've heard so many
good things about you.

18:02.882 --> 18:04.651
Not.

18:04.751 --> 18:05.718
So.

18:05.818 --> 18:08.388
So, didn't we vow
to become the world's

18:08.488 --> 18:10.490
most hippest parents?

18:10.590 --> 18:12.559
Well, babe, that
was in the '70s.

18:12.659 --> 18:16.296
Our groove was in
a more mellow bag.

18:16.396 --> 18:18.931
We swore that we would
treat our kids differently

18:19.031 --> 18:20.600
than our parents treated us.

18:20.700 --> 18:21.968
I think we have.

18:22.068 --> 18:26.306
ROSEANNE: No, we made a snap
judgment about this Johnny guy.

18:26.406 --> 18:28.841
Just exactly what my
parents would've done.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.344
That wasn't a snap
judgment, the guy's a punk.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.612
You didn't even see him.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.481
I trust your judgment.

18:34.581 --> 18:36.583
Well, that's just
the point, Dan.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.385
It's not up to us to judge.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.687
My dad thought you were a punk.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.422
I was!

18:42.522 --> 18:45.425
That's how come I know
this guy is a punk.

18:45.525 --> 18:48.628
No, like it or not, we are
now the parents of a teenager.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.763
And we are not the
hip parents that we

18:50.863 --> 18:51.698
said we were going to be.

18:51.798 --> 18:54.567
Define hip parents.

18:54.667 --> 18:55.535
OK.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.737
Sure, honey, Johnny
can stay over.

18:57.837 --> 19:00.473
Me and Daddy could, like,
crash out on the floor, man.

19:00.573 --> 19:01.741
You guys could use our bed.

19:04.577 --> 19:07.247
That's the kind of parent
I thought I want to be.

19:07.347 --> 19:08.681
Well, we ain't them, baby.

19:08.781 --> 19:12.419
Well, we ain't Robert
Young and Jane Wyatt, either.

19:12.519 --> 19:13.920
DAN: Well, who are we?

19:14.020 --> 19:16.623
Well, we ain't
Bonnie and Edgar.

19:16.723 --> 19:17.990
Aloha.

19:18.090 --> 19:19.792
Aloha!

19:19.892 --> 19:21.861
Well, what do we want to be?

19:21.961 --> 19:26.499
Well, I want to be the kind of
parent that can trust our kids.

19:26.599 --> 19:27.967
Oh, we want to be the
kind of parents that

19:28.067 --> 19:30.370
can look at a kid dressed
like Johnny Swanko

19:30.470 --> 19:31.771
and not think that
he's only got one

19:31.871 --> 19:33.206
thing on his filthy
little mind and we've

19:33.306 --> 19:36.243
both got a pretty good suspicion
of what that one thing is?

19:36.343 --> 19:37.877
Yeah, well, you
were kind of a punk

19:37.977 --> 19:41.013
and I was pretty innocent when
we went out on our first date,

19:41.113 --> 19:43.416
remember?

19:43.516 --> 19:44.417
I sure do.

19:50.089 --> 19:51.991
Becky!

19:52.091 --> 19:53.726
Well, I think we're
doing the right thing.

19:53.826 --> 19:54.827
You know what?

19:54.927 --> 19:57.029
I think we're doing
the right thing, too.

19:57.129 --> 19:58.631
What now?

19:58.731 --> 20:00.066
Your mother and I
have come to a decision

20:00.166 --> 20:03.370
about the Swanko situation.

20:03.470 --> 20:04.837
Can I go out with him?

20:04.937 --> 20:06.205
Not in a million years.

20:25.157 --> 20:26.926
Where are you going?
- To get the paper.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.270
What's the matter?

20:37.370 --> 20:40.206
Something is about to occur
that's going to make you wish

20:40.307 --> 20:42.108
you would've woke up
as a different person

20:42.208 --> 20:43.943
in a different house
in a different country

20:44.043 --> 20:44.844
on a different planet.

20:47.414 --> 20:49.749
[doorbell rings]

20:54.754 --> 20:55.655
Croissants.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.964
[music playing]

21:12.472 --> 21:14.073
EDGAR: It's called goncha.

21:14.173 --> 21:16.476
It's an herb from Tibet.

21:16.576 --> 21:18.077
What region is it from, honey?

21:18.177 --> 21:19.379
The Bonesta region.

21:19.479 --> 21:20.480
It's up north.

21:20.580 --> 21:22.882
Oh, you can make
