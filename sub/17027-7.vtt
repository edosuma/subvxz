00:01.369 --> 00:04.638
KARA: When I was a child,
my planet Krypton was dying.

00:04.672 --> 00:08.309
I was sent to Earth
to protect my cousin.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.278
But my pod got
knocked off-course

00:10.311 --> 00:11.745
and by the time I got here,

00:11.779 --> 00:15.483
my cousin
had already grown up
and become Superman.

00:16.784 --> 00:18.452
I hid who I really was

00:18.486 --> 00:22.623
until one day
when an accident forced me
to reveal myself to the world.

00:22.656 --> 00:26.094
To most people,
I'm a reporter
at CatCo World Wide Media.

00:26.127 --> 00:29.397
But in secret, I work with my
adopted sister for the DEO

00:29.430 --> 00:31.632
to protect my city
from alien life

00:31.665 --> 00:34.135
and anyone else
that means to cause it harm.

00:35.669 --> 00:38.806
I am Supergirl.

00:38.839 --> 00:40.408
Previously on Supergirl...

00:40.441 --> 00:42.576
He needs a blood transfusion.
From you.

00:42.610 --> 00:45.079
-My blood?
-The blood of a Green Martian.

00:48.616 --> 00:49.617
SUPERGIRL: Who are you?

00:50.384 --> 00:51.719
Guardian.

00:51.752 --> 00:54.455
I shouldn't get involved
with someone who's just
fresh off the boat.

00:54.488 --> 00:56.590
I'm here for you,
but as a friend.

01:01.329 --> 01:03.097
Welcome to Cadmus.

01:14.175 --> 01:16.410
Why are you doing this?

01:16.444 --> 01:18.479
Because it's time
for you to die.

01:21.215 --> 01:22.383
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

01:25.253 --> 01:26.487
This place is...

01:27.355 --> 01:28.422
Exotic.

01:28.456 --> 01:31.592
Hmm. You know, for a place

01:31.625 --> 01:35.129
that caters to aliens,
they have some pretty
good chicken wings.

01:35.163 --> 01:36.464
How do you know
that's chicken?

01:36.497 --> 01:37.731
(GRUNTS)

01:37.765 --> 01:39.700
The latest in a series
of armored truck robberies

01:39.733 --> 01:44.772
was thwarted last night
when National City's newest
crime fighter took a stand.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.874
The new guy. Of course.

01:46.907 --> 01:50.744
Guardian?
(CLEARS THROAT) I thought
you said he helped you.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.146
He did...

01:52.713 --> 01:53.881
-But?
-But,

01:53.914 --> 01:55.816
I don't know, I just

01:55.849 --> 01:58.219
don't think the city
should be putting its trust
in him so quickly.

01:58.252 --> 01:59.620
(SCOFFS)
Well, I mean the armored

01:59.653 --> 02:01.755
truck robber that he stopped
wasn't a joke.

02:01.789 --> 02:04.558
Apparently, it was, like,
three versus one.

02:20.241 --> 02:21.642
I didn't say
he wasn't impressive.

02:21.675 --> 02:24.378
I just said I didn't know
if he's trustworthy.

02:24.412 --> 02:25.913
Well, what do you have
against the guy?

02:25.946 --> 02:28.749
Ah, well, for starters,
why wear a mask?

02:28.782 --> 02:31.952
Why cover your face
when you're on the up and up?
I don't wear a mask.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.355
I will say this about the guy.

02:34.388 --> 02:35.489
He photographs well.

02:35.523 --> 02:37.625
Like, well, his suit does.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.393
I bet he's working
with a partner.

02:39.427 --> 02:41.629
Why? Why would you say that?

02:42.796 --> 02:44.498
Whoa, bad guy
number three at your six!

02:44.532 --> 02:47.601
He is gonna need some shield
in three, two, one.

02:47.635 --> 02:48.536
(SHIELD CLANGS)

02:48.569 --> 02:50.671
(CHUCKLES) I love it
when they go clang.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.340
GUARDIAN: So what's next?
WINN: Flasher in Finley Park?

02:52.373 --> 02:53.974
GUARDIAN: Uh, hard pass.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.976
I'm just saying,
in every situation,

02:56.009 --> 02:58.679
Guardian seems
to be one step ahead.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.548
That screams sidekick.

03:00.581 --> 03:01.649
Sidekick?

03:01.682 --> 03:03.917
Okay, so if, if this guy
actually had a number two,

03:03.951 --> 03:05.686
I think they would
actually be more equals.

03:05.719 --> 03:07.888
My cousin worked
with a vigilante once.

03:07.921 --> 03:10.258
Tons of gadgets,
Lots of demons.

03:10.291 --> 03:11.892
I mean, vigilantes are nuts.

03:11.925 --> 03:14.595
Or maybe you are just
afraid of the competition.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.897
No. No. No. No.
Alex, you agree
with me, right?

03:16.930 --> 03:19.967
I mean, masks,
the voice changer thing,
it's weird.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.435
It's weird.

03:21.469 --> 03:22.470
Danvers!

03:24.472 --> 03:26.340
Hi. It's been a hot minute.
How are you?

03:27.007 --> 03:28.842
Yeah. Good. Good, yeah.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.545
Uh, everybody, this is Maggie.

03:31.579 --> 03:33.847
Maggie, this is, um,
everybody.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.450
James, Winn and Kara.

03:37.385 --> 03:39.253
Oh! The sister!

03:39.287 --> 03:41.289
Oh, I've heard so much
about you from Alex.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.790
And I've heard all about you.

03:43.957 --> 03:46.494
Um, can I borrow you a minute?

03:47.728 --> 03:50.264
Yeah.

03:50.298 --> 03:53.901
Hey, so, you haven't
returned any of my calls.
I've been worried about you.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.936
Oh, I've been working.

03:55.969 --> 03:59.740
Right. Must have been
a lot of rogue aliens
at large.

03:59.773 --> 04:00.774
There always are.

04:01.675 --> 04:02.776
Listen, I...

04:02.810 --> 04:05.813
I just wanted to make sure
things were okay with us.

04:05.846 --> 04:09.517
Because the last time
we saw each other,
things got a little, uh,

04:09.550 --> 04:11.619
you know, like, complicated.
(CHUCKLES)

04:11.652 --> 04:14.355
I don't know.
I thought they were pretty
straightforward.

04:14.388 --> 04:16.056
I'm fresh off the boat.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.725
That's not your thing.

04:17.758 --> 04:18.926
It's no big deal.

04:18.959 --> 04:22.630
Yeah, I like you, Alex.
It's just, you know,
the situation.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.732
-It's nothing personal.
-No, I didn't think it was.

04:25.633 --> 04:27.267
Okay. Good.

04:27.835 --> 04:29.269
Still friends?

04:30.671 --> 04:31.672
Of course.

04:33.641 --> 04:34.642
Yeah.

04:37.345 --> 04:38.879
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm good.

04:40.013 --> 04:41.682
So, where is Mon-El?

04:41.715 --> 04:43.617
I mean,
doesn't he practically
live at this place?

04:43.651 --> 04:45.786
Oh, knowing him?
He's probably at
Darla's apartment

04:45.819 --> 04:49.457
or Eve's apartment
or with that blond Valeronian.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.992
What's the word
for a male floozy?

04:52.025 --> 04:53.060
A Daxamite?

04:53.093 --> 04:54.528
Ha.

04:54.562 --> 04:56.830
Well, at least
he's having fun on Earth.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.668
If you could just tell me why
I'm here,

05:00.701 --> 05:02.670
I promise it would be
a good conversation starter.

05:04.772 --> 05:05.773
(SIGHS)

05:06.674 --> 05:08.609
Okay. I give up.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.878
What's your favorite
baseball team?

05:10.911 --> 05:14.482
That's the one with the hoop
and the tall guys bouncing
the ball, right?

05:14.515 --> 05:16.717
Oh. A courtship ring.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.853
You know, I've just learned
that there is a long-standing
mating ritual here

05:19.887 --> 05:23.624
where if you like it,
you should've put
a ring on it.

05:23.657 --> 05:27.094
Clearly you've been
successful in this arena.
So...

05:27.127 --> 05:29.830
But from the looks of you,
she can't be that pretty.

05:29.863 --> 05:30.798
(LAUGHS)

05:30.831 --> 05:32.933
What do you call
ugly women on this planet?

05:32.966 --> 05:35.436
Is it cats? No, dogs...

05:35.469 --> 05:37.771
Don't think you're
so important that I won't
shoot you.

05:37.805 --> 05:40.574
Well, that would be a relief
from staring
at your ugly face.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.485
Leaving so soon?

05:53.621 --> 05:55.723
-J'onn!
-Mon-El. Get out of here.

05:55.756 --> 05:59.593
If you want your friend
to live, I suggest you don't
listen to him and stand down.

05:59.627 --> 06:01.729
Don't listen to her. Run!

06:01.762 --> 06:05.499
No! Okay. Okay.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.835
Now that's a good choice.

06:14.442 --> 06:15.809
Knock. Knock.

06:15.843 --> 06:18.746
M'gann. We're good,
we're good.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.616
To what do I owe
this unexpected pleasure?

06:22.650 --> 06:24.652
I just wanted to see
how you were feeling.

06:24.685 --> 06:27.821
Well, thanks to you
and your Martian blood,
I'm almost at 100%.

06:29.122 --> 06:30.724
I hope you don't want it back.

06:30.758 --> 06:31.892
(GIGGLES)

06:31.925 --> 06:34.795
I, uh, whipped up a batch
of K'rkzar's tonic for you.

06:37.197 --> 06:40.534
My grandmother would
make us drink this
whenever we were unwell.

06:40.568 --> 06:43.671
I used ghost peppers
to replicate z'arr roots.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.773
First you save my life,
then you make it better.

06:51.211 --> 06:52.880
J'onn? What is it?

06:59.620 --> 07:01.655
I'm good. I should, uh...

07:02.723 --> 07:04.458
I should get back to work.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.660
Okay.

07:06.694 --> 07:08.496
Well, I'm, I'm glad
you're feeling better.

to need one.

a hostage situation?

more my speed.

save this time?

08:12.793 --> 08:14.795
Saved? You mean murdered.

about the Guardian?

08:20.768 --> 08:23.637

sent us this security footage.

Looks like a hero to me.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.745
Wait for it.

(STAMMERING)
No, that's not right.

08:36.049 --> 08:37.317
The Guardian
didn't kill that guy.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.219
You need glasses, Olsen.
You just saw it.

08:39.252 --> 08:41.288
What no... What I saw was
the Guardian leave.

08:41.321 --> 08:43.090
When the Guardian left,
that man was alive.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.693
So he changed his mind,
came back and blew
the guy away.

08:45.726 --> 08:46.760
No. He wouldn't do that.

08:46.794 --> 08:48.696
Oh, God. I should've known.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.230
Should have known what?

pre-existing beliefs
and ignore anyone
who disagrees with you.

You're in the tank
for superheroes.

(STAMMERING) I'm not in a tank
for superheroes.

09:02.810 --> 09:06.246
Oh, please. As the kids say,
you're BFFs with Superman.

09:06.279 --> 09:10.117
You've assigned 18 front page
stories in the past month
alone to Supergirl.

Uh, excuse me. I have
an emergency that only
James Olsen can solve.

what they're saying, dude?

-You need to calm down.
-I cannot calm down!

is coming down, man.

Take a breath.

09:38.712 --> 09:40.247
-Now. Okay?
-Okay.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.616
First and foremost,
and most importantly,
I didn't kill that guy.

Dude. They've got you on tape.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.719
-It wasn't me!
-Well, it's on tape,
all right?

09:45.753 --> 09:47.420
And if they find you,
they find me.

09:47.454 --> 09:50.991
I'm your accomplice.
I can't survive in prison!
I've seen every season of Oz.

We gotta shut
this Guardian thing down
right now.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.194
No! No. We are not shutting
this down

09:54.227 --> 09:57.030
because some gun nut wants
to use us as a smoke screen.

Okay, not when
we're making a difference.
I mean, come on.

to make a difference in jail?

trust me, okay?

for the price of one.

to clear our names.

to say no to joining

but not this?

10:42.910 --> 10:44.878
That was really beautiful.

10:44.912 --> 10:49.182

a Shaolin Monk
in the late 1800s.

10:49.216 --> 10:52.652
Whenever I'm feeling
out of sorts,

10:53.954 --> 10:56.123
it brings me back to center.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.158
Are you still feeling sick
from the Parasite?

11:00.127 --> 11:03.697

my wife and daughters.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.305
Like they're in the room
with me.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.742
Maybe this has
something to do with M'gann.

11:16.977 --> 11:20.714
When I got to Earth,
I saw my parents everywhere.

11:20.748 --> 11:24.818
I was in my room one night,
I remember looking up
at the stars

11:26.453 --> 11:29.056
and feeling so alone.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.158
I started to cry.

11:31.959 --> 11:33.426
And Eliza came in my room.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.729
And I yelled
at her to get out.

11:35.763 --> 11:36.930
Yelled?

11:37.998 --> 11:39.967
It's hard to imagine you
as a teenager.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.202
Well, I wasn't
always this mature.

11:43.270 --> 11:44.972
Eliza refused to leave.

11:46.106 --> 11:47.941
She said

11:47.975 --> 11:51.011
that my parents
would want me to be loved,

11:51.044 --> 11:54.081
and that nothing would
replace them.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.016
That they were a part
of who I am.

12:01.388 --> 12:06.259
It was the first time
I ever let her really hug me,

12:06.293 --> 12:10.430
and that was the first time
I didn't feel alone anymore.

12:10.463 --> 12:14.067
Having M'Gann in your life
doesn't mean losing
your family.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.872
It means feeling whole again.

12:26.814 --> 12:28.415
Three keys dust.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.250
You couldn't put it
in a briefcase or something?

12:30.283 --> 12:32.485
You've got to carry it around
like a goldfish?

12:32.519 --> 12:34.087
I'm cutting down on overhead.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.102
GUARDIAN: Who are you?
What're you doing?

12:49.136 --> 12:52.172
VIGILANTE: Keeping our
city safe just like you.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.374
I don't kill.

12:54.407 --> 12:55.809
Maybe you should.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.527
I thought we could be allies,

13:14.561 --> 13:18.298
but you aren't willing
to do what's necessary
to see justice done.

13:18.331 --> 13:19.332
(POLICE CAR SIREN)

13:25.072 --> 13:27.908
NCPD! Drop the shield
and get your hands in the air!

13:30.510 --> 13:32.012
You're making a mistake.

13:36.383 --> 13:38.919
Damn it.

13:38.952 --> 13:42.355
NCPD has Guardian
pinned down near the wharf.
They just called for backup.

13:42.389 --> 13:45.025
Let's get this guy
once and for all.

13:45.058 --> 13:46.226
(HIGH PITCHED HUMMING)

13:47.627 --> 13:49.997
-Hello, Kryptonian.
-Cadmus.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.364
Got it in one.

13:51.398 --> 13:54.067
And do you know why
we call ourselves that?

13:54.101 --> 13:55.869
Cadmus was the very
first Greek hero.

13:55.903 --> 13:58.505
If you think you're a hero,
you're crazier than I thought.

13:58.538 --> 14:00.207
I'm inviting you over.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.409
We already have
a guest waiting for you.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.311
Your Daxamite friend.

14:04.344 --> 14:07.214
But if you tell anyone
where you're headed, he dies.

14:07.247 --> 14:09.616
If you refuse to come,
he dies.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.284
Come to me, Supergirl.

14:11.318 --> 14:13.420
But I should warn you.
In the myths,

14:13.453 --> 14:16.389
Cadmus was really
only famous for one thing.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.226
He killed monsters.

14:38.511 --> 14:41.448
J'onn, what're you doing here?

14:41.481 --> 14:45.485
I think the real question is,
what are you doing here?

14:47.487 --> 14:51.491
I should have locked
you in that laboratory
when I had the chance.

14:51.524 --> 14:55.095
You're Hank Henshaw.
The real Hank Henshaw.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.298
You survived?

14:58.331 --> 15:00.934
Yes, I survived.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.404
But that alien,

15:04.437 --> 15:06.473
that thing from Mars,
stole my life.

15:08.075 --> 15:09.977
It took everything from me.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.678
But Cadmus saved me.

15:11.711 --> 15:14.281
And now you work for them?

15:14.314 --> 15:17.417
When I ran the DEO,
we hunted aliens.

15:17.450 --> 15:22.089
Now Cadmus has inherited
that glorious purpose.

15:22.122 --> 15:25.692
To end alien life
on this planet.

15:25.725 --> 15:27.160
Good luck with that.

15:31.331 --> 15:32.399
My turn.

15:34.001 --> 15:35.168
(GROANS)

15:43.110 --> 15:44.277
Why are you doing this?

15:44.311 --> 15:46.246
Because it's time
for you to die.

15:52.485 --> 15:56.323
You and the rest
of the alien scum

15:56.356 --> 15:59.226
have no place
on this planet.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.095
(SCREAMS)

16:20.613 --> 16:22.382
Hank Henshaw is dead.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.219
I'm Cyborg Superman.

16:28.155 --> 16:31.258
We've issued an arrest order
for the vigilante
known as "Guardian"

16:31.291 --> 16:33.126
on multiple counts
of assault and murder.

16:33.160 --> 16:37.264
We urge any citizens
with knowledge of Guardian's
whereabouts or identity...

16:37.297 --> 16:39.466
Hey, Winn,
have you heard from Kara?

16:39.499 --> 16:41.701
The last I heard she was
on her way to help
capture Guardian.

16:41.734 --> 16:44.704
Huh, she, she probably just
missed him. She's at CatCo,
I'm sure.

16:44.737 --> 16:48.541
Um, speaking of Guardian,
you've got to tell
your friend to lay off him.

16:48.575 --> 16:49.609
Like...
(CHUCKLES)

16:49.642 --> 16:51.711
Why? What's it to you?

16:51.744 --> 16:56.116
(CHUCKLES)
You know, it's, um, you know,
it's just, with your sister,

16:56.149 --> 17:00.253
and Superman, and Hank even,
sometimes or J'onn...
Well, I just...

17:00.287 --> 17:03.290
I really support
the vigilante cause.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.525
Yeah, well, you heard it
from my "friend" on the TV.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.660
Guardian isn't a vigilante.
He's a murderer.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.162
Actually. No. He's not.

17:11.164 --> 17:13.066
Do you know something
about Guardian, Winn?

17:13.500 --> 17:14.434
(MOCKS CHUCKLE)

17:14.467 --> 17:17.270
Is... I just...
I know he's not a bad guy.

17:17.304 --> 17:18.638
All right. So, if you can
just have your friend,

17:18.671 --> 17:20.207
Maggie, please give him
a break.

17:21.674 --> 17:24.211
I know six different
very painful ways

17:24.244 --> 17:28.648
to get you to tell me
who Guardian is,
using my index finger.

17:28.681 --> 17:31.584
-But before I go there...
-It's James. It's James.

17:32.852 --> 17:35.322
Guardian is James.

17:36.823 --> 17:38.358
Are you kidding me?

17:41.861 --> 17:43.330
What're you doing?
What're you doing?

17:43.363 --> 17:45.865
-I'm calling Kara.
-No! You can't call Kara.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.735
Alex, you can't tell anyone,
not your sister, not Maggie.

17:48.768 --> 17:51.871
No one. Right,
James is out there,
trying to help.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.673
And he helped,
he helped stop Parasite.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.708
And he's going to help stop
whoever this is

17:55.742 --> 17:58.678
who's really killing
these people,
because you and I both know,

17:58.711 --> 18:00.580
James Olsen isn't a murderer.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.552
Thank you.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.620
-Hey.
-I'll deal with the both
of you later.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.865
-Mon-El.
-Are you okay?

18:18.898 --> 18:21.468
Now I know how the bad guys
feel when I pummel them.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.238
Yeah, I'm okay.

18:25.905 --> 18:27.307
They captured J'onn, too.

18:27.340 --> 18:28.808
That wasn't J'onn.

18:28.841 --> 18:32.812
Remember I once told
you J'onn assumed
the identity of a human?

18:32.845 --> 18:35.782
That's the human,
Hank Henshaw.

18:35.815 --> 18:38.351
Only they enhanced
him somehow.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.487
They tricked me.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.489
(GROANS)

18:42.522 --> 18:45.692
The bars are made from
Nth metal from Thanagar.
They're unbreakable.

18:45.725 --> 18:48.361
So, what is this place?
Who are these people?

18:48.395 --> 18:50.397
It's called Cadmus.

18:50.430 --> 18:53.533
It's run by scientists
who want to wipe aliens
off the face of the planet.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.402
News just gets better
by the second.

18:55.435 --> 18:58.538
So what? I'm the, uh,
the lucky first contestant?

18:59.672 --> 19:03.176
No... No, they kidnapped
you to get to me.

19:08.915 --> 19:10.917
Huh, Danvers,
I was just texting you.

19:10.950 --> 19:13.353
I need you to lay off
Guardian.

19:13.386 --> 19:15.688
You mean National City's
masked serial killer?
No way.

19:15.722 --> 19:18.858
He's not a killer, Maggie.
You're targeting
the wrong guy.

19:18.891 --> 19:20.493
Okay, I'm listening.

19:20.527 --> 19:22.295
That's it.

19:22.329 --> 19:23.663
If you want me to drop
my prime murder suspect,

19:23.696 --> 19:24.964
you gotta give me more
than that.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.933
I can't. It's classified.

19:26.966 --> 19:28.701
Come on, Alex. We're friends.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.303
No, Maggie,

19:31.738 --> 19:33.306
we're not friends.

19:34.441 --> 19:37.677
Oh. Okay, I'm lost.
What happened?

19:37.710 --> 19:38.978
We hung out,

19:39.011 --> 19:40.413
we got close,

19:40.447 --> 19:42.582
then you called me out
for liking you,

19:42.615 --> 19:46.653
and then I had the guts
to admit, "Yes, it's true."

19:46.686 --> 19:50.623
And you told me
that my feelings were real

19:50.657 --> 19:52.692
and that I deserved
to be happy,

19:52.725 --> 19:56.396
and so I thought you meant
I deserved to be happy
with you.

19:56.429 --> 19:57.897
-Alex...
-No, no, no. I'm not done.

19:57.930 --> 20:01.301
Because then you convinced
me to come out to my sister.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.370
And I did,

20:03.403 --> 20:06.539
because I was sure
of one thing.

20:06.573 --> 20:09.376
And that was
my feelings for you.

20:09.409 --> 20:11.311
Initially, I was terrified.

20:11.344 --> 20:12.979
But ultimately,

20:13.012 --> 20:15.715
I was proud to come out

20:15.748 --> 20:19.852
because it wasn't
just some concept.

20:19.886 --> 20:25.458
It was about my feelings
for this amazing woman.

20:25.492 --> 20:26.693
But now?

20:26.726 --> 20:28.995
I don't feel liberated,

20:29.028 --> 20:31.431
or like I'm on some
great journey.

20:31.464 --> 20:34.934
All I feel is pain because

20:34.967 --> 20:36.869
you don't want me.

20:36.903 --> 20:40.407
-Alex, that's not why...
-Just, you know what, save it.
Okay, let's...

20:40.440 --> 20:41.874
It's not what's
important right now.

20:41.908 --> 20:44.577
What's important
is that you back off Guardian.

20:50.917 --> 20:53.620
Hey, um, have you heard
from Kara?

20:53.653 --> 20:55.755
No. She hasn't checked in yet.

20:55.788 --> 20:59.626
-Are you worried?
-It's not like her to go
radio silent.

20:59.659 --> 21:02.261
Let's give her sometime
before we press
the panic button.

21:06.799 --> 21:10.770
J'onn!
Put your weapon down. J'onn!

21:17.377 --> 21:18.545
Stand down.

21:20.380 --> 21:22.715
Alex, you need
to run some tests on me.

21:22.749 --> 21:23.783
Something's wrong.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.522
Supergirl.

21:29.556 --> 21:31.691
I don't believe
we've been introduced.

21:32.825 --> 21:35.428
I've seen you before

21:35.462 --> 21:37.830
in Lena Luthor's office.
What were you doing there?

21:38.865 --> 21:41.033
I might ask you the same.

21:41.067 --> 21:43.870
I don't like the idea
of you around my daughter.

21:45.037 --> 21:46.706
You're Lillian Luthor.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.041
Lex and Lena's mother.

21:49.075 --> 21:50.410
I'm a lot of things.

21:50.443 --> 21:52.612
A doctor, a patriot,
a mother...

21:52.645 --> 21:55.081
A liar, a kidnapper, a killer.

21:55.114 --> 21:56.749
Does Lena know about Cadmus?

21:57.850 --> 22:00.086
Does she know who her mother
really is?

22:00.119 --> 22:01.854
And what
are you to my daughter?

22:01.888 --> 22:03.022
I'm a friend.

22:03.055 --> 22:04.957
I've heard that before.

22:04.991 --> 22:09.562
Years ago, Superman
came to my son, Lex,
and promised him the world.

22:09.596 --> 22:12.432
A new dawn for mankind.

22:12.465 --> 22:14.401
Lex believed him, poor thing.

22:15.101 --> 22:17.570
And then he watched

22:17.604 --> 22:19.939
as your kinsman
infected this country

22:19.972 --> 22:23.643
with his propaganda,
as his power became unchecked.

22:23.676 --> 22:26.078
And when Lex
tried to take that power back,

22:26.112 --> 22:29.382
Superman convinced
the world Lex was evil.

22:30.817 --> 22:31.818
My darling boy.

22:33.019 --> 22:35.588
My genius son.

22:35.622 --> 22:38.525
An actual Superman,
behind bars for life.

22:40.026 --> 22:42.595
Because you and your kind

22:42.629 --> 22:45.031
will stop at nothing
to poison the Earth.

22:45.064 --> 22:46.499
You're out of your mind.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.635
We'll agree to disagree.

22:50.603 --> 22:51.904
So, what am I doing here?

22:51.938 --> 22:53.473
I need something from you.

22:53.506 --> 22:55.742
I need you to be human
for a little while.

22:55.775 --> 22:57.844
I know from your fight
with Red Tornado

22:57.877 --> 23:00.680
when you expel
enough of your heat vision,

23:00.713 --> 23:02.882
you deplete
the solar radiation
in your cells,

23:02.915 --> 23:05.652
leaving you as helpless
as any mere mortal.

23:05.685 --> 23:08.955
I've designed this helmet
to absorb the radiation.

23:08.988 --> 23:10.490
You want me to solar flare?

23:12.058 --> 23:13.526
That's never gonna happen.

23:13.560 --> 23:14.761
I can't hurt you.

23:15.562 --> 23:17.864
But I can hurt him.

23:19.566 --> 23:21.434
-(SCREAMS)
-No! Mon-El!

23:21.468 --> 23:24.136
Now we've been
studying your friend.

23:24.170 --> 23:27.874
He's powerful,
but has a very
bad lead allergy.

23:29.709 --> 23:32.011
Say you'll do it
and I'll let him live.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.649
Or I could just put one
in his heart right now.

23:36.683 --> 23:38.985
No! Okay, okay!
I'll do it. Stop!

23:39.018 --> 23:40.520
Please. Don't.

23:40.553 --> 23:41.954
I'm not gonna let you die.

23:45.091 --> 23:46.459
Give me the helmet.

24:23.129 --> 24:24.564
Thank you.

24:29.035 --> 24:30.036
Well.

24:31.303 --> 24:33.940
It worked. Take her.

24:36.609 --> 24:37.844
Supergirl!

24:38.611 --> 24:39.879
Supergirl!

24:48.020 --> 24:49.956
What are you going
to do with me?

24:57.296 --> 24:58.731
What are you doing?

24:59.632 --> 25:02.001
She was supposed
to save Mon-El.

25:02.034 --> 25:03.035
That was our deal!

25:03.970 --> 25:05.171
Where is she?

25:05.204 --> 25:06.806
I suggest you relax.

25:07.774 --> 25:09.776
It will all be over soon.

25:12.178 --> 25:13.813
Why do you need my blood?

25:20.920 --> 25:22.722
Where have you been, bro?
We've got to get this guy.

25:22.755 --> 25:26.025
Dude, genius takes time.
Okay.

25:26.058 --> 25:28.227
-I think I've found something.
-What you got?

25:28.260 --> 25:30.930
All right. So our evil,
trigger-happy vigilante,
right?

25:30.963 --> 25:33.600
If his MO is killing
all criminals,

25:33.633 --> 25:35.267
why didn't he kill
the drug dealer? Huh?

25:35.301 --> 25:37.203
He completely skipped over
the guy selling the drugs,

25:37.236 --> 25:39.606
and only targeted
the guy buying the drugs.

25:39.639 --> 25:40.707
Strange, right?

25:40.740 --> 25:42.141
-Yeah.
-Right. So,

25:42.174 --> 25:44.811
I looked into the background
of our drug buyer

25:44.844 --> 25:46.979
and he was convicted
of drug possession

25:47.013 --> 25:49.348
but he was released
from jail on a technicality.

25:49.381 --> 25:50.817
-So?
-So,

25:50.850 --> 25:52.318
the first guy
that your evil twin shot,

25:52.351 --> 25:54.186
the stick-up guy
you hung upside-down?

25:54.220 --> 25:58.124
Awesome. Uh,
he had a prior murder
conviction

25:58.157 --> 26:01.994
but was also released
on a technicality.
Juror misconduct.

26:02.028 --> 26:04.797
So he's targeting criminals
that he thinks
gamed the system.

26:04.831 --> 26:07.333
Right. So I looked into more
bad guys who got lucky.

26:07.366 --> 26:09.301
And one jumped out at me.

26:09.335 --> 26:12.972
This guy, now he was accused
of shooting a woman named
Julie Karnowsky.

26:13.005 --> 26:15.174
But the judge declared
a mistrial

26:15.207 --> 26:18.044
after the murder weapon was
deemed improperly classified.

26:18.077 --> 26:21.047
-Okay.
-So Julie's husband, Phillip,

26:21.080 --> 26:23.215
was understandably
very upset about all this.

26:23.249 --> 26:27.086
Thing is, Philip Karnowsky
is an ex-SEAL.

26:27.119 --> 26:29.321
Three tours
in the worst parts of Iraq.

26:29.355 --> 26:31.658
And no one has seen him
for months.

26:31.691 --> 26:33.092
You think Karnowsky's our man?

26:33.125 --> 26:35.628
The guy who killed his wife
was found dead last week.

26:35.662 --> 26:37.029
Shot.

26:37.063 --> 26:39.298
Now my hunch is Karnowsky
got a taste for revenge

26:39.331 --> 26:42.201
and now he wants to make
everybody he thinks got away
with murder pay for it.

26:42.234 --> 26:44.003
And do you have any clue
where he might be now?

26:44.036 --> 26:46.939
Better. I think I know
who his next victim is.

26:51.043 --> 26:53.412
I thought it was my mind
playing tricks on me
when I saw the vision

26:53.445 --> 26:58.718
of my family,
but now I realize
it's much more than that.

26:58.751 --> 27:02.722
All your blood work came back
normal after M'Gann's
blood transfusion.

27:02.755 --> 27:04.223
Seeing my family is one thing.

27:04.256 --> 27:06.258
Almost killing a DEO agent
I thought was a White Martian,

27:06.292 --> 27:07.860
that's something
else entirely.

27:12.364 --> 27:15.134
Okay. Blood cell count
is normal.

27:15.167 --> 27:17.804
Creatine, enzymes,
platelets, too.

27:19.038 --> 27:22.141
Oh, that's odd.
Your hematocrit
levels are down.

27:22.174 --> 27:26.645
Could be dehydration,
higher concentration
of sodium, so let me check.

27:31.984 --> 27:33.652
I've never seen that before.

27:37.056 --> 27:38.057
I have.

27:41.460 --> 27:42.862
Going somewhere?

27:43.930 --> 27:45.832
J'onn, let me explain.

27:45.865 --> 27:47.900
Explain how
you're a White Martian?

27:47.934 --> 27:49.836
-How you intend to
exterminate me?
-No!

27:49.869 --> 27:52.471
Then where were you
running off to?

27:52.504 --> 27:54.306
To tell your people
where I am?

27:54.340 --> 27:55.975
I would never hurt you.

27:56.008 --> 27:58.945
I'm not like the others.
I wanted to protect you.

27:58.978 --> 28:00.713
-You're a liar!
-You're right.

28:01.948 --> 28:03.215
But I am not like them.

28:04.250 --> 28:05.818
You need to believe me.

28:07.386 --> 28:09.355
It was me

28:09.388 --> 28:12.725
at the internment camp
near the Galle Crater,
the one I told you about.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.795
I was that White Martian.

28:15.828 --> 28:19.031
I was the one who couldn't
bear to watch
another innocent die.

28:19.065 --> 28:20.432
I refused the kill order.

28:20.466 --> 28:23.202
I tried to free as many
Green Martians as I could.

28:23.235 --> 28:24.336
I wanted to get them all

28:24.370 --> 28:27.106
to safety but the other
guards, they came after us.

28:29.275 --> 28:30.910
I barely escaped.

29:19.926 --> 29:22.094
I need you to tell
Alex something for me.

29:23.863 --> 29:25.531
I need you to tell her to just

29:25.564 --> 29:28.100
keep living her life
on her own terms.

29:31.570 --> 29:33.239
Tell her I wasn't
scared, okay?

Well, if I don't make it
and you do,

29:39.245 --> 29:40.579

to tell everyone
I was scared out of my mind.

You don't deserve to die.

29:57.496 --> 29:59.198
You deserve to survive.

That Prince on Daxam
sacrificed himself because
he saw you were worth it.

the bullet out now.

found you sooner.

high and left!

bullets. I did not realized
he had grenades.

39:59.197 --> 40:01.099
You've become
really important to me.

40:01.132 --> 40:03.502
And, um,

40:03.535 --> 40:05.737
I hope one day, you and I
could be friends.

40:09.040 --> 40:12.010
Because I don't want
to imagine my life
without you in it.

40:20.051 --> 40:21.587
Pool. Tomorrow night.

40:22.854 --> 40:23.889
Wouldn't miss it.

40:29.495 --> 40:30.529
How was that?

40:30.562 --> 40:32.063
Ugh. Spy much?

40:32.097 --> 40:34.032
(CHUCKLES)

40:34.065 --> 40:37.669
It was good.
We're just gonna be friends.

40:38.036 --> 40:39.037
Okay.

40:41.106 --> 40:42.841
We're gonna find
Jeremiah, Alex.

40:43.274 --> 40:44.710
I swear.

40:45.544 --> 40:46.745
But he seemed, um...

40:47.813 --> 40:48.980
He seemed okay?

40:49.014 --> 40:50.048
He saved me.

40:51.216 --> 40:52.584
And he was still...

40:53.251 --> 40:54.686
Him.

40:57.523 --> 40:59.925
I still can't believe
Lena's mother
is the head of Cadmus.

40:59.958 --> 41:01.793
I know.
I wonder if she knows.

41:01.827 --> 41:04.029
Well, I want to know what
Cadmus wants with your blood.

41:05.564 --> 41:06.765
You and I both.

41:18.777 --> 41:20.646
Unknown life form detected.

41:20.679 --> 41:22.948
Halt or you will be
disintegrated.

41:24.950 --> 41:27.519
Halt or you will be
disintegrated.

41:31.557 --> 41:33.058
This will be
your final warning.

41:40.298 --> 41:41.833
Hello, Kara Zor-El.

41:41.867 --> 41:43.134
How can I help you today?

41:47.038 --> 41:50.842
Tell me everything
you know about the project
you call Medusa.
