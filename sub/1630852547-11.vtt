WEBVTT

00:03.078 --> 00:04.394
Hey, Wyatt, how have you been?

00:04.413 --> 00:05.746
Oh, I'm feeling pretty good.

00:05.840 --> 00:07.489
It's my birthday today.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.249
Well, happy birthday.

00:09.401 --> 00:13.012
You get a free cupcake.

00:13.163 --> 00:14.496
Thank you.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.849
You know I gave him
a birthday cupcake last week.

00:17.076 --> 00:18.742
And I gave him one yesterday.

00:18.761 --> 00:22.079
That man has had 18 birthdays
since we've opened.

00:22.097 --> 00:23.338
Uh, ju-- just one minute.

00:23.432 --> 00:24.672
Well, I gave him
a gluten-free one.

00:24.841 --> 00:26.466
See? We<i> can</i> give those away.

00:26.527 --> 00:30.771
Did anyone else notice
the dog that is bigger than me

00:30.865 --> 00:32.514
tied up out front?

00:32.533 --> 00:33.940
Well, I hope someone
didn't abandon him.

00:34.093 --> 00:35.275
If someone abandoned him,

00:35.427 --> 00:37.427
I swear, I will go John Wick
on their ass.

00:37.446 --> 00:39.020
Well, how long has
he been out there?

00:39.040 --> 00:40.355
I don't know.

00:40.449 --> 00:43.450
Um, okay, people,
did anyone tie up a dog outside?

00:43.602 --> 00:45.193
Oh, shoot, did he poop?

00:45.212 --> 00:46.436
I'll grab some napkins.

00:46.455 --> 00:48.029
Can you bring a coffee
out to me, honey?

00:48.123 --> 00:49.715
Uh, it's Kat.

00:49.866 --> 00:50.883
Nick. No cream or sugar.

00:51.110 --> 00:52.292
Uh, there is a line, you know.

00:52.444 --> 00:55.128
Yeah, I appreciate
you letting me cut.

00:56.039 --> 00:57.447
Wh-- Just hold on
one more moment.

00:57.466 --> 00:59.783
You're not really taking
that man coffee, are you?

00:59.876 --> 01:01.118
My brain says no,

01:01.211 --> 01:04.980
but my people-pleasing heart
says yeah.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.233
All right, Brutus,
there's a lady coming.

01:08.385 --> 01:11.128
Look sharp, no farting.
I'll try and do the same.

01:11.146 --> 01:14.464
Hey, you really shouldn't leave
your dog unattended like that.

01:14.558 --> 01:16.133
I mean, what if he got loose?

01:16.151 --> 01:17.317
Oh, he'd be fine.
He's got my phone number.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.303
If you ask nice,
he'll give it to you.

01:19.321 --> 01:21.805
Oh, I think I'd rather
have his number.

01:21.824 --> 01:23.140
Oh!
(laughs)

01:23.233 --> 01:25.233
Sorry, Brutus is a rascal.

01:25.327 --> 01:26.977
-He does whatever I'm thinking.
-(chuckles)

01:26.995 --> 01:28.812
Hope your breath
is better than his.

01:28.905 --> 01:31.315
Well, the good news is
he didn't poop.

01:31.333 --> 01:33.408
I almost did
when he jumped up on me.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.669
-So is this your café?
-Yeah, it is.

01:35.821 --> 01:38.097
Ah, I just opened up that new
sandwich shop down the street,

01:38.248 --> 01:39.431
Meat, Myself and I.

01:39.583 --> 01:40.265
Get it?

01:40.492 --> 01:42.434
Yes, I'm familiar with wordplay.

01:42.620 --> 01:44.328
All right, well,
stop by my place sometime,

01:44.421 --> 01:45.829
I'll make you a sandwich.

01:45.848 --> 01:49.274
Oh, and, um, take care of these
for me, will you, honey?

01:50.594 --> 01:53.595
Uh, I'm not a secretary in
the '50s, I don't go by "honey."

01:53.614 --> 01:55.614
Got it. See you around.

01:57.434 --> 01:59.025
♪<i> Me, oh, my, oh, my, oh, me</i> ♪

01:59.178 --> 02:01.286
♪<i> Nothin' wrong with you</i>
<i> but I'd rather be me.</i> ♪

02:01.956 --> 02:03.438
Hey, what are you doing?

02:03.515 --> 02:05.699
Oh, I'm making a "welcome
to the neighborhood" basket

02:05.851 --> 02:06.850
for Nick.

02:06.869 --> 02:08.368
For Mr. Give Me a Coffee, Honey?

02:08.462 --> 02:11.371
He never paid for that,
by the way.

02:11.523 --> 02:14.024
I know he was kind of a jerk,
but I've made a welcome basket

02:14.042 --> 02:16.301
for every new business
that's opened on the block.

02:16.528 --> 02:18.137
Even the skateboard place
that greeted me with,

02:18.288 --> 02:20.139
"Hey, Tyler, your mom's here."

02:20.290 --> 02:21.789
They still call you
"Tyler's mom."

02:21.809 --> 02:24.868
You know, honestly, he's
a good kid, I could do worse.

02:24.887 --> 02:28.313
You know, you really are like
the neighborhood ambassador.

02:28.540 --> 02:30.207
Ooh, I like that.
Spread the word.

02:30.300 --> 02:32.042
I want to make it a thing.

02:32.060 --> 02:33.635
Hello, all.

02:33.654 --> 02:34.802
-Oh, hey, Max.
-Hi, Max.

02:34.897 --> 02:36.229
I have been instructed
to present

02:36.382 --> 02:38.615
this gift
to one Miss Randi Hamilton.

02:40.810 --> 02:42.661
He knows that I can see him
through the window, right?

02:42.888 --> 02:45.998
Just play along, he wanted
to watch your reaction.

02:47.817 --> 02:49.059
Oh, my gosh!

02:49.152 --> 02:51.152
This was my favorite
chocolate bar as a kid.

02:51.172 --> 02:52.579
I didn't know
they still made it.

02:52.731 --> 02:54.322
Carter called the company
and found a candy store

02:54.416 --> 02:56.199
that still sells them,
then he drove

02:56.201 --> 02:58.051
two hours to get it.

02:58.921 --> 03:00.086
Each way or round trip?

03:00.239 --> 03:02.072
I will not be taking
follow-up questions.

03:02.090 --> 03:03.740
This is weird enough as it is.

03:03.833 --> 03:05.350
Have a nice day.

03:07.913 --> 03:09.855
Aw, Carter is so sweet.

03:10.006 --> 03:11.932
It makes my teeth hurt.

03:12.084 --> 03:14.418
That or it's about to rain.

03:14.436 --> 03:17.011
I love that he spoils you
just 'cause.

03:17.105 --> 03:19.013
Yeah, I know.

03:19.033 --> 03:21.942
Honeybun, for someone
who's holding a candy bar,

03:22.094 --> 03:23.685
you do not seem very happy.

03:23.779 --> 03:26.371
It's just that ever since
Carter and I went official,

03:26.448 --> 03:28.598
he keeps giving me these
thoughtful little gifts.

03:28.617 --> 03:31.210
And I guess I'm not used
to that type of affection.

03:31.361 --> 03:34.287
Marty and I used to give
each other things all the time.

03:34.364 --> 03:36.440
And write each other poems.

03:36.533 --> 03:38.942
Oh, what are we talking--
haiku, limerick?

03:38.961 --> 03:40.201
Erotic.

03:40.221 --> 03:42.446
I'm gifted with dirty rhymes.

03:42.464 --> 03:44.372
Block, smock,

03:44.391 --> 03:46.800
clock, they all rhyme with...

03:46.894 --> 03:48.785
We got it.

03:48.804 --> 03:50.211
Do we?

03:50.231 --> 03:52.547
Oh, now we do, yeah.

03:52.566 --> 03:55.400
Well, maybe I can give this
thoughtful gift thing a try.

03:55.627 --> 03:57.236
Though I don't know
how I can compete.

03:57.463 --> 03:59.296
What about a trip to Hawaii?

03:59.314 --> 04:00.797
If I could afford that,
do you think

04:00.816 --> 04:03.316
I would be wearing an apron
with a cat face on it?

04:03.410 --> 04:05.911
I'm gonna pretend
like the answer to that is yes.

04:06.138 --> 04:07.579
What about a kitten party?

04:07.731 --> 04:09.473
You know, where you dress up
all the cats

04:09.491 --> 04:11.416
like your favorite
science fiction writers?

04:11.568 --> 04:13.627
Margaret Cat-wood.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.237
No, that's more for me.

04:16.257 --> 04:18.090
Why don't you just ask him?

04:18.241 --> 04:19.983
Well, that defeats
the whole purpose.

04:19.985 --> 04:21.409
All right, then listen to him.

04:21.503 --> 04:23.077
You know, when people talk,
they're telling you

04:23.097 --> 04:25.338
exactly what they want.

04:25.491 --> 04:27.081
That's right.

04:27.159 --> 04:30.060
-Rolex.
-Kitten party.

04:32.831 --> 04:33.830
Hi.

04:33.923 --> 04:35.274
Hello, Brutus.

04:35.501 --> 04:37.592
May I? It's a cat treat--
I hope he's not too picky.

04:37.611 --> 04:38.685
Oh, he loves a cat treat.

04:38.928 --> 04:41.688
No fillers though, right?
Just 100% pure cat?

04:41.765 --> 04:44.007
That's not funny.

04:44.026 --> 04:45.509
That's kind of funny.

04:45.527 --> 04:47.527
I actually brought
something for you, too.

04:47.604 --> 04:49.121
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

04:49.348 --> 04:51.456
If you want a date,
all you got to do is ask.

04:51.608 --> 04:53.274
Uh, I've got a boyfriend,
thanks.

04:53.294 --> 04:55.352
I can't tell you how many
relationships I've been in

04:55.354 --> 04:58.204
that started with,
"I have a boyfriend."

04:58.357 --> 05:01.358
Does this little gambit
work on a lot of women?

05:01.376 --> 05:02.542
I do all right.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.553
Actually, Brutus
does most of the heavy lifting.

05:06.122 --> 05:07.639
See, that I believe.

05:07.866 --> 05:09.457
I just came by
to say welcome to the block.

05:09.551 --> 05:11.643
I'm kind
of the neighborhood ambassador.

05:11.795 --> 05:12.886
Oh, is that an official title?

05:13.038 --> 05:14.128
Yeah, it comes with a townhouse

05:14.148 --> 05:15.480
and diplomatic plates.

05:15.707 --> 05:17.149
So what do we have here?

05:17.376 --> 05:19.059
Oh, well, this is
our special coffee blend.

05:19.211 --> 05:21.044
We get our beans
from a local roaster.

05:21.063 --> 05:22.879
Two different types of Arabica.

05:22.898 --> 05:25.048
With vanilla-- cute.

05:25.067 --> 05:27.233
Our coffee program's
pretty extensive.

05:27.386 --> 05:28.902
Hawaiian Kona,
Guatemalan Robusta,

05:29.054 --> 05:30.829
and an Ethiopian single origin
that'll make you feel

05:30.998 --> 05:32.238
like you just did an eight ball.

05:32.391 --> 05:33.907
Is that a good thing?

05:34.001 --> 05:36.168
Have you tried an eight ball?

05:36.395 --> 05:38.486
I own a cat café--
what do you think?

05:39.414 --> 05:40.747
You want to put something
in your mouth that

05:40.899 --> 05:41.673
you'll think about for weeks?

05:41.900 --> 05:42.824
Woah, what?

05:42.918 --> 05:44.158
Oh!

05:44.236 --> 05:46.252
(laughing):
Oh, this-this cheese, yeah.

05:46.347 --> 05:48.363
Oh, that's really good cheese.

05:48.365 --> 05:50.665
Right? A little nutty,
a little naughty.

05:50.759 --> 05:52.684
-What is it?
-Reblochon.

05:52.836 --> 05:54.094
Made from unpasteurized milk.

05:54.246 --> 05:55.579
Totally illegal
to serve that in the U.S.

05:55.597 --> 05:57.080
Aren't you worried
about the health inspector?

05:57.173 --> 05:58.523
Or the FDA?

05:58.600 --> 06:00.525
Nah, I'm like the wife visiting
her husband in prison.

06:00.602 --> 06:03.253
I know how to make
a package disappear.

06:03.271 --> 06:04.254
Oh.

06:04.347 --> 06:06.180
You're not gonna narc on me,
are you?

06:06.200 --> 06:07.591
I am not a snitch,

06:07.684 --> 06:09.851
no matter what it says
in my high school yearbook.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.778
Great. You want a beer?

06:11.930 --> 06:13.187
You have a liquor license?

06:13.207 --> 06:14.431
No. That's why I don't sell it.

06:14.449 --> 06:16.023
I just offer it to anyone
who wants to tip

06:16.043 --> 06:17.767
seven dollars a bottle.

06:17.786 --> 06:19.211
Oh, wow, okay, no thanks.

06:19.362 --> 06:21.271
You know, I feel like if I learn
anything else about you,

06:21.273 --> 06:22.939
I'm gonna be called in
to testify at some point.

06:23.032 --> 06:24.124
I'm just gonna go.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.550
Well, hold on a second.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.110
You, uh...

06:27.112 --> 06:29.796
got a little cheese
on your neck.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.038
Oh, uh, okay, thanks.

06:31.133 --> 06:32.224
You're welcome.

06:32.451 --> 06:34.300
Come back anytime, Kitty Kat.

06:34.395 --> 06:37.287
It's Kat. Just, uh, just Kat.

06:37.347 --> 06:39.806
Or Katharine, but only
my mother calls me that.

06:39.958 --> 06:42.884
Whoa! And you, sir,
are not my mother.

06:42.978 --> 06:44.294
-(door rattles)
-Oh, gosh.

06:44.312 --> 06:45.979
It's one of the-- you pull?

06:46.073 --> 06:47.656
Got it, yep. Bye.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.153
Dude, you could not win a fight
with a silverback gorilla.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.971
(scoffs) Coming from a guy
who said he can

06:54.990 --> 06:56.564
take on an ostrich
running at full speed.

06:56.733 --> 06:58.733
CARTER:
What? Have you seen me
display my dominance?

06:58.827 --> 07:01.811
Man, that thing would stop
in its tracks.

07:01.905 --> 07:03.313
I'm the apex predator.

07:03.331 --> 07:05.832
Oh, my goodness!
I've been listening to you two

07:05.984 --> 07:07.000
for the past 20 minutes.

07:07.076 --> 07:08.260
"I could headbutt a rhino,"

07:08.429 --> 07:09.819
"I could body-slam
an alligator,"

07:09.913 --> 07:11.412
when neither one of you
are brave enough

07:11.432 --> 07:12.989
to arm-wrestle me.

07:13.008 --> 07:14.215
I'm brave enough.

07:14.268 --> 07:15.583
Just need to be
in the right headspace.

07:15.677 --> 07:17.769
Okay then,
what should we be talking about?

07:17.921 --> 07:20.163
I don't know.
Something important,

07:20.256 --> 07:22.441
like-like
what's the meaning of life

07:22.592 --> 07:25.760
or-or what would you want
that's under $32 after tax.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.521
You know, I think a lot
about the meaning of life

07:28.674 --> 07:30.023
and why we're here...

07:30.117 --> 07:31.783
That is so fascinating.

07:31.935 --> 07:32.784
Okay, Carter, you're up.

07:32.936 --> 07:34.435
Wants? Needs? Wants?

07:34.455 --> 07:36.938
Hmm. You know what I've
always really, really wanted?

07:37.032 --> 07:37.939
I'm listening.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.124
To fight a lion.

07:39.351 --> 07:41.609
A lion would rip you to shreds.

07:41.628 --> 07:44.187
Okay, neither one of you could
win a fight against any animal.

07:44.206 --> 07:45.613
We could if we trained.
(gasps)

07:45.632 --> 07:47.466
There's a new boxing gym
on Fifth. We should go together.

07:47.693 --> 07:50.026
That'd be awesome.
Hey, I need boxing gloves.

07:50.028 --> 07:51.361
Ooh, okay! Boxing gloves.

07:51.454 --> 07:52.804
Do these come
in specific sizes or colors?

07:53.031 --> 07:55.548
-I got you.
I have an extra pair.
-Mm, hey, you know

07:55.701 --> 07:57.033
what would be better
for fighting a lion?

07:57.052 --> 07:58.310
-Hmm?
-Jujitsu.

07:58.461 --> 08:00.370
Okay, is there any equipment
you need for that?

08:00.388 --> 08:02.872
Yeah, a gi, a mouthguard,
safety gear.

08:02.891 --> 08:04.541
Okay. Uh, good to know.

08:04.559 --> 08:05.709
Yeah, I still got all that
from my tae kwon do days.

08:05.727 --> 08:06.485
(grunts)

08:06.712 --> 08:07.877
MAX:
Okay, Randi,

08:07.971 --> 08:09.362
let's arm-wrestle.

08:11.066 --> 08:12.882
(chuckles):
Oh!

08:12.901 --> 08:14.493
Told you.

08:17.723 --> 08:18.830
Hola!

08:18.982 --> 08:20.406
Oh, hey! What a nice surprise.

08:20.501 --> 08:21.833
I was just having lunch
at that new sandwich place.

08:21.985 --> 08:22.834
Thought I'd bring you one.

08:22.986 --> 08:24.911
Oh. Thanks.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.004
What's wrong?

08:26.081 --> 08:27.154
You're usually over the moon

08:27.249 --> 08:28.656
when I bring you
unexpected snacks.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.342
If she doesn't want it,
we'll take it.

08:30.493 --> 08:33.903
It's just the owner of that
place is incredibly annoying.

08:33.922 --> 08:35.329
So is that a no?

08:35.423 --> 08:37.574
I thought he was cool.
Why don't you like him?

08:37.667 --> 08:39.425
I'm just gonna take it.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.261
Because he's basically
a criminal.

08:41.429 --> 08:43.688
Serving illegal cheese,
selling illegal beer,

08:43.840 --> 08:45.006
while all
of the other businesses

08:45.100 --> 08:46.340
are following the rules.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.917
Eh, I don't know.
I think that hair salon

08:48.011 --> 08:49.361
might be a front for something.

08:49.588 --> 08:51.196
I am constantly delivering boxes
of shampoo--

08:51.347 --> 08:53.256
never seen
a single customer in there.

08:53.349 --> 08:54.758
No, I've seen someone there
once.

08:54.776 --> 08:56.017
Though he was bald,

08:56.036 --> 08:57.536
so you might be onto something.

08:57.763 --> 08:59.596
All right, I got to go.
I'm double-parked out front.

08:59.765 --> 09:01.522
You really should get
a yellow curb like Nick.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.542
-Nick has a yellow curb?
-Yeah.

09:03.693 --> 09:05.359
How did he get that?
I applied a year ago

09:05.379 --> 09:06.211
and haven't heard back.

09:06.362 --> 09:08.046
I don't know. Ask him.

09:08.197 --> 09:09.506
All right, love you. Bye.

09:10.292 --> 09:12.199
Okay, that's weird, right?

09:12.294 --> 09:13.943
Like, how did he get a curb
so fast?

09:14.037 --> 09:15.111
(scoffs)
I bet he bribed someone.

09:15.130 --> 09:16.704
Or painted it himself.

09:16.723 --> 09:19.391
-You think he'd do that?
-Oh, I wouldn't put it past him.

09:19.542 --> 09:21.042
He's one of those guys
who thinks he can do

09:21.061 --> 09:22.285
whatever he wants
'cause he's good-looking.

09:22.304 --> 09:23.620
Like, "Hey, I'm Nick.
I'm good-looking.

09:23.713 --> 09:25.455
I can do whatever I want
'cause I'm good-looking."

09:25.473 --> 09:27.899
Why are you letting
this guy get under your skin?

09:28.051 --> 09:29.292
He's not getting under my skin.

09:29.311 --> 09:31.144
Well, he's getting
under something!

09:31.296 --> 09:33.146
He's not getting under anything.

09:33.298 --> 09:34.406
And it's only a matter of time

09:34.482 --> 09:36.132
before justice catches up
with him.

09:36.225 --> 09:37.300
Give me that sandwich.

09:37.393 --> 09:39.578
Let me see what all the hubbub
is about.

09:42.065 --> 09:44.499
Holy balls, that's delicious!

09:46.328 --> 09:47.068
So?

09:47.087 --> 09:49.504
I've had better.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.154
(soft chatter)

09:58.173 --> 09:59.764
Hey! Kitty Kat.

09:59.916 --> 10:01.157
Hey, Nick-Knack!

10:01.292 --> 10:04.010
That sounded cooler in my head.

10:04.162 --> 10:05.345
What's with the smile?

10:05.439 --> 10:06.679
You look like the cat
who swallowed something.

10:06.832 --> 10:09.941
Oh, I did. I'm the cat
who swallowed a curb.

10:10.093 --> 10:11.835
Again, cooler in my head.

10:11.928 --> 10:13.169
What do you mean?

10:13.188 --> 10:14.446
Well, I did a little digging

10:14.597 --> 10:16.339
around your new yellow zone
out there.

10:16.432 --> 10:18.265
You may not know this,
but I was once

10:18.285 --> 10:19.676
on the neighborhood
business council.

10:19.845 --> 10:22.454
Yes, I was. I've got the mug
and the visor to prove it.

10:23.181 --> 10:24.180
So I could say,

10:24.199 --> 10:25.606
"Guess what I found out,"

10:25.775 --> 10:27.608
but I think you already know...

10:27.702 --> 10:29.202
That I painted the curb myself?

10:29.354 --> 10:31.187
...that you painted
the curb yourself!

10:31.206 --> 10:33.873
So that's what's got
your panties in a bunch.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.783
You know,
I was willing to overlook

10:35.802 --> 10:39.696
your questionable orgasmic
cheese and your unlicensed beer,

10:39.714 --> 10:43.308
but that curb is a flagrant
violation of common courtesy.

10:43.535 --> 10:46.144
Even worse than your use
of the word "panties."

10:46.371 --> 10:48.872
Hold that lecture.
My best customer's here.

10:48.890 --> 10:49.873
Hey, man!

10:49.891 --> 10:50.890
What can I get you?

10:51.042 --> 10:52.058
I'll take a number four.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.377
Ooh! And put it inside
a number two.

10:54.396 --> 10:55.378
Hey, Kat.

10:55.471 --> 10:56.546
Did you come
to get the good stuff?

10:56.564 --> 10:58.047
Did you know he has

10:58.066 --> 10:59.899
illegal sausage from France?

10:59.993 --> 11:01.551
-What?
-It's a gray area,

11:01.644 --> 11:03.903
but I know a guy who knows a guy
who knows a pig.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.889
Well, knew a pig.

11:05.907 --> 11:07.573
(chuckles)
You should really get a sandwich

11:07.668 --> 11:09.058
while you're here.
They're phenomenal.

11:09.152 --> 11:11.318
No, no.
These sandwiches are built

11:11.338 --> 11:14.080
on the backs of shortcuts
and lies.

11:14.232 --> 11:15.489
You need to paint that curb
back.

11:15.509 --> 11:17.158
It's just not fair
to your neighbors.

11:17.326 --> 11:18.826
No one's stopping them
from painting their curbs.

11:18.920 --> 11:22.238
Oh, so-so everyone just does
whatever they damn well please

11:22.257 --> 11:24.257
and no one is respecting
their neighbor?

11:24.409 --> 11:26.685
And then do you know
what we have, Nick?

11:26.836 --> 11:28.019
We have anarchy.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.263
Well, at least
it'll be interesting.

11:30.415 --> 11:32.248
-Just paint the curb back.
-Come on, Kat.

11:32.341 --> 11:33.599
Is it really that big of a deal?

11:33.752 --> 11:35.860
Yes! And you're not supposed
to take his side.

11:36.012 --> 11:38.512
-I'm not taking his side.
-Well, it sure sounds
like you're taking his side.

11:38.606 --> 11:40.365
-Well, I'm not.
-Oh!

11:40.592 --> 11:42.258
I am sensing
a lovers' quarrel here.

11:42.277 --> 11:43.201
Is this your boyfriend?

11:43.352 --> 11:44.610
(chuckles):
Oh. No.

11:44.763 --> 11:45.704
-No, Kat's my best friend.
-(chuckles)

11:45.931 --> 11:47.354
Really?

11:47.374 --> 11:49.115
-I would've bet money
that you two were bangin'.
-What?

11:49.209 --> 11:51.376
-Uh, no, no, no. (chuckles)
-Yeah, no. No.

11:51.603 --> 11:53.119
-(chuckles)
-I mean, we-we had a thing
a while ago,

11:53.288 --> 11:55.046
-but it was...
-Like, it...
wasn't really a thing.

11:55.273 --> 11:57.215
-Well, it was kind of a thing.
-Like, it was, like,
a little bit of a thing,

11:57.366 --> 11:58.532
but it's not a thing anymore.

11:58.552 --> 12:00.427
-Yeah. It's-it's-it's not.
-It's not.

12:01.037 --> 12:02.870
Got it. Misread.

12:02.889 --> 12:05.223
Zero sexual tension here.

12:07.210 --> 12:08.393
(exhales sharply)

12:09.287 --> 12:11.020
So, how long on that sandwich?

12:13.233 --> 12:15.458
Hey, guys.
I really need your help.

12:15.477 --> 12:17.627
I've been going a little crazy
trying to figure out

12:17.720 --> 12:20.146
what to give Carter, but I think
I got some good stuff here.

12:20.223 --> 12:22.389
Okay, uh... Oh, what's this?

12:22.409 --> 12:25.059
Oh, that is a napkin
from our first date.

12:25.153 --> 12:26.244
Pretty romantic, right?

12:26.395 --> 12:28.471
You saved the napkin
from your first date?

12:28.564 --> 12:30.081
No, that's from
a different Applebee's,

12:30.233 --> 12:31.565
but he won't know that.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.901
Oh, so you're gonna show him
you care by lying?

12:33.979 --> 12:35.903
Okay, now you just ruined it.

12:35.997 --> 12:37.571
Let's keep digging.

12:37.665 --> 12:39.090
-What is this?
-Oh!

12:39.317 --> 12:40.333
That is a coffee warmer,

12:40.427 --> 12:42.485
because he drinks coffee
and he...

12:42.504 --> 12:44.003
warmers my heart.

12:44.172 --> 12:46.005
"Warms" was right there.

12:46.174 --> 12:47.599
(sighs)
See? I'm no good at this.

12:47.750 --> 12:49.993
Okay, well, don't give up.
Let's keep looking.

12:50.086 --> 12:51.327
Oh, uh, what's this?

12:51.346 --> 12:53.271
Oh! That is
a catalog of cemetery plots

12:53.498 --> 12:57.066
to show him that I am thinking
long-term. (chuckles)

12:57.927 --> 12:59.593
Wow, that's...

12:59.613 --> 13:00.445
really nice.

13:00.672 --> 13:02.429
No, it's not. It's creepy.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.098
-Yeah, it's totally creepy.
-(sighs)

13:04.117 --> 13:06.175
Truth, hon,

13:06.194 --> 13:07.285
I am not seeing a winner.

13:07.436 --> 13:10.196
O-Okay, there is
one more possibility,

13:10.348 --> 13:11.790
but I need you
to withhold all judgment.

13:12.017 --> 13:15.376
I made it in my ceramics class,
and clay is not my medium.

13:17.205 --> 13:17.962
Oh!

13:18.114 --> 13:19.038
Good Lord!

13:19.132 --> 13:20.298
I said withhold all judgment!

13:20.525 --> 13:22.283
Is that supposed to be Carter?

13:22.377 --> 13:23.042
(sighs)

13:23.136 --> 13:25.028
Oh, it's just wonderful!

13:25.046 --> 13:27.713
Yeah, it's not at all disturbing

13:27.808 --> 13:29.365
or seemingly cursed.

13:29.384 --> 13:31.367
You guys,
I don't know what to do.

13:31.386 --> 13:32.385
Stop stressing out.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.220
It's not like Carter's expecting
anything.

13:34.372 --> 13:36.389
Yeah, but he's really into
all this romantic crap,

13:36.541 --> 13:38.499
and I'm not good
at expressing myself!

13:38.501 --> 13:41.319
Well, you might start
by not calling it "crap."

13:41.470 --> 13:42.153
Fair point.

13:42.305 --> 13:44.322
'Cause the truth is, I'm...

13:44.473 --> 13:47.308
(mumbles): sorta, kinda starting
to fall in love with him.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.993
I'm sorry, what was that?

13:49.220 --> 13:50.403
Oh, don't make me say it again.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.555
-Oh, girl,
you're gonna say it again.
-(sighs)

13:52.574 --> 13:53.723
Fine! Fine.

13:54.059 --> 13:56.726
I'm kinda, sorta starting
to fall in love with him.

13:56.819 --> 13:58.244
(chuckles):
Aw! Sweetie!

13:58.396 --> 14:00.229
Look who has
a gooey nougat center.

14:00.248 --> 14:02.507
You know what? It might just be
easier if I break up with him.

14:02.658 --> 14:05.826
Hey, you guys doing
free coffee today?

14:05.846 --> 14:07.161
No?

14:07.180 --> 14:08.847
Okay. See you later.

14:08.998 --> 14:10.089
Wait, where are you going?

14:10.241 --> 14:11.741
That new place down the street

14:11.759 --> 14:13.167
is giving away free coffee.

14:13.261 --> 14:14.594
There's a sign out front.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.187
What?

14:16.414 --> 14:17.171
(yelps)

14:17.190 --> 14:18.748
I thought it moved.

14:18.766 --> 14:20.083
Very funny.

14:20.101 --> 14:21.401
Wait, did it?

14:23.104 --> 14:25.088
You have got to be kidding me!

14:25.090 --> 14:26.422
Coffee and animals--

14:26.515 --> 14:28.616
what a great idea.

14:30.519 --> 14:32.704
(soft chatter)

14:41.272 --> 14:42.605
Nick, what the hell?

14:42.698 --> 14:44.290
You can get the free coffee
without bringing the sign.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.291
It's not like a coupon.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.534
What are you guys doing here?!

14:47.554 --> 14:49.203
He's got five kinds
of prosciutto!

14:49.297 --> 14:51.447
-And truffle aioli!
-Where else would we be?

14:51.540 --> 14:54.041
We talked about this. We said we
were gonna boycott this place.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.226
I never agreed to that.

14:55.453 --> 14:56.786
I had no idea we
were coming here for lunch.

14:56.879 --> 14:58.955
Before I knew it,
I was on my second sandwich.

14:59.048 --> 15:00.339
You're both traitors.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.049
Do you know that he put a sign
in front of my café

15:02.068 --> 15:03.384
to steal my customers?

15:03.403 --> 15:05.128
Sorry, sweetie,
but this sandwich is so good.

15:05.146 --> 15:06.145
Can't I love you both?

15:06.297 --> 15:08.889
Oh. So this is your boyfriend.

15:08.983 --> 15:10.149
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

15:10.301 --> 15:11.558
And he's having lunch
with your best friend

15:11.578 --> 15:13.077
who you may or may not have had
a thing with?

15:13.304 --> 15:14.895
We're very evolved people!

15:14.973 --> 15:15.972
Yeah, we're buds now.

15:16.065 --> 15:17.231
It's actually kind of nice.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.065
Well,

15:18.159 --> 15:19.584
whatever tickles your pickle.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.161
-Nick, I am not done with you.
-Listen,

15:22.255 --> 15:23.479
you don't own the sidewalk.

15:23.498 --> 15:24.923
I put my sign
in a high-traffic area.

15:25.074 --> 15:26.482
It's business-- nothing more.

15:26.501 --> 15:29.485
All right. If that's how
we're gonna play this,

15:29.504 --> 15:31.003
you watch out.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.722
I'm comin' for you.

15:33.825 --> 15:35.433
Guys, let's go.

15:35.584 --> 15:36.434
I got to back my girl.

15:36.585 --> 15:38.010
But, also,
wrap up five sandwiches.

15:38.163 --> 15:39.562
We'll come get 'em later.

15:41.166 --> 15:42.607
Make it ten.

15:49.507 --> 15:50.856
(knocking)

15:51.009 --> 15:52.191
Hello.

15:52.343 --> 15:54.101
-Hello, Mother.
-(door closes)

15:54.120 --> 15:56.195
Ooh! What's happening here?

15:56.289 --> 15:58.605
Please say
you're painting the café.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.349
All those pastels.

16:00.368 --> 16:02.034
It's like a women's
health center down there.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.444
Every time I walk in,

16:03.463 --> 16:05.797
I feel like I'm getting
a mammogram.

16:05.948 --> 16:07.465
I'm painting a curb.

16:07.616 --> 16:09.709
It's the first step
in a two-part plan

16:09.861 --> 16:11.302
to exact revenge on Nick.

16:11.454 --> 16:14.305
Oh, yes, the bad boy of cheese.

16:14.457 --> 16:16.623
You know, I'm not much for food
you eat with your hands,

16:16.718 --> 16:21.037
but, oh, what he's doing with
those sandwiches is remarkable.

16:21.055 --> 16:22.538
Not you, too?

16:22.631 --> 16:25.316
Well, you know my weak spot
is artisanal and hard-to-get.

16:25.426 --> 16:29.045
Now, what's the second part
of this big plan?

16:29.138 --> 16:30.471
Oh, I'm gonna dress up
like a cat

16:30.565 --> 16:32.548
and I'm gonna stand
in front of his shop

16:32.567 --> 16:36.552
and spin this arrow sign to
direct traffic towards my café.

16:36.571 --> 16:39.146
Have you thought
about a one-part plan?

16:39.165 --> 16:42.166
Sweetie, let it go.

16:42.393 --> 16:44.502
No, I can't. This guy
just rubs me the wrong way,

16:44.729 --> 16:47.338
with his stupid little smirk
and his swagger.

16:47.415 --> 16:49.732
He's smirking and swaggering
all over the place.

16:49.751 --> 16:53.069
Hmm. Sounds like
maybe he rubs you the right way.

16:53.087 --> 16:55.238
What is that supposed to mean?

16:55.331 --> 16:56.663
I think you have a little crush.

16:56.832 --> 16:59.575
(chuckles):
I do not have a crush on Nick.

16:59.668 --> 17:02.336
Really? He's all you've talked
about the last couple of days,

17:02.430 --> 17:06.024
and you seem to be finding
reasons to go see him.

17:06.100 --> 17:07.750
He's actively targeting me.

17:07.769 --> 17:10.436
That's because he likes
getting a rise out of you.

17:10.530 --> 17:13.197
It's like you're in kindergarten
and he's pulling your pigtails.

17:13.424 --> 17:15.199
-That's ridiculous.
-Is it?

17:15.426 --> 17:17.035
You know,
the next step after this

17:17.262 --> 17:19.704
is playing doctor
under the monkey bars.

17:20.765 --> 17:21.706
Mother, I have a boyfriend.

17:21.857 --> 17:24.525
Doesn't mean
you can't have a crush.

17:25.528 --> 17:27.270
You know I don't enjoy
these little visits

17:27.363 --> 17:28.437
as much as you do, right?

17:28.439 --> 17:31.591
Honey,
it's not always about you.

17:36.222 --> 17:37.555
-Hey, babe.
-Hey.

17:37.706 --> 17:40.725
-What you got there?
-Hold on, hold on.

17:40.910 --> 17:41.726
Voilà!

17:41.953 --> 17:43.469
Ooh.

17:43.563 --> 17:44.954
What am I looking at here?

17:44.972 --> 17:46.046
It's you.

17:46.066 --> 17:47.473
Are you sure?

17:47.567 --> 17:51.110
Yeah, it's my way of showing
how I feel about you.

17:52.146 --> 17:54.405
Whatever I did wrong,
I am so sorry.

17:54.557 --> 17:57.149
No, actually, you've been doing
everything right.

17:57.302 --> 17:59.635
Why is my mouth on my forehead?

17:59.654 --> 18:01.728
It's because you always speak
your mind.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.248
And-and, right here,
I was trying to show

18:04.400 --> 18:06.250
the kindness in your eyes.

18:06.402 --> 18:08.160
There's something in those eyes.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.254
-All seven of 'em.
-(scoffs) See?

18:10.406 --> 18:11.405
This was a bad idea.

18:11.499 --> 18:13.073
Why don't you just put it
on the roof

18:13.093 --> 18:13.925
so we can scare the pigeons
away?

18:14.076 --> 18:15.000
No, no, no!

18:15.153 --> 18:16.410
I love it! I love it.

18:16.429 --> 18:17.244
No, you don't.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.097
-No, I don't.
-(sighs)

18:19.248 --> 18:21.841
I just wanted to show you
how much I care.

18:21.935 --> 18:23.326
Sometimes I worry
that our relationship

18:23.344 --> 18:25.085
might feel a little one-sided.

18:25.105 --> 18:26.587
What are you talking about?

18:26.755 --> 18:28.681
It's just that you do so much
for me.

18:28.833 --> 18:31.334
All the little gifts
and thoughtful surprises.

18:31.502 --> 18:32.777
I just don't want you to feel

18:32.928 --> 18:34.520
like you're in this
more than I am.

18:34.672 --> 18:35.354
Are you kidding?

18:35.506 --> 18:36.839
I feel like I can't keep up

18:36.858 --> 18:38.599
with all the nice things
you do for me.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.676
Really? Wh-What do I do?

18:40.695 --> 18:42.011
You put my towels in the dryer

18:42.029 --> 18:43.696
so they're warm
when I get out of the shower.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.848
You bought me those
glow-in-the-dark footprints

18:45.941 --> 18:48.367
so I know where to stand to pee
in the middle of the night.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.777
Well, honestly,
that one was for the both of us.

18:50.946 --> 18:54.781
Plus, there's that thing
you did in bed last Thursday.

18:54.801 --> 18:55.875
That was a one-off.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.877
Still meant a lot.

18:58.029 --> 18:59.695
So...

18:59.714 --> 19:01.973
we just have different ways
of saying the same thing.

19:02.124 --> 19:03.549
Exactly.

19:03.701 --> 19:05.368
And I'm
a pretty great girlfriend.

19:05.461 --> 19:06.811
-Yeah.
-(chuckles)

19:06.888 --> 19:08.888
You know what would make you
a really great girlfriend?

19:08.982 --> 19:11.440
It was a one-off.

19:17.048 --> 19:18.138
Hey.

19:18.232 --> 19:20.049
Haven't seen you
in a couple days.

19:20.142 --> 19:22.827
Thought you were, uh,
"comin' for me."

19:23.721 --> 19:26.238
I decided
you weren't worth the energy.

19:26.391 --> 19:28.833
Aw. Didn't peg you as a quitter.

19:29.002 --> 19:30.334
Well, I am full of surprises.

19:30.486 --> 19:31.560
What do you want, Nick?

19:31.579 --> 19:33.320
Nothing.
I was just putting my sign out,

19:33.414 --> 19:35.581
figured I'd stop in and say hi.

19:35.733 --> 19:37.233
Hi.

19:37.326 --> 19:38.567
That it?

19:38.736 --> 19:40.827
You're not gonna stomp your feet
and raise your fist

19:40.922 --> 19:42.996
and yell, "Anarchy"?

19:43.016 --> 19:45.183
You only get one "anarchy"
per week.

19:45.334 --> 19:47.000
You have rules for anarchy?

19:47.020 --> 19:48.244
Goodbye, Nick.

19:48.262 --> 19:50.095
All right, I'll go.

19:50.248 --> 19:51.263
Can I ask you something?

19:51.357 --> 19:53.858
If it gets you to leave, yeah.

19:54.085 --> 19:55.860
Your boyfriend--

19:56.045 --> 19:57.253
does he challenge you?

19:57.346 --> 19:59.697
Why would you ask me that?

19:59.774 --> 20:00.940
I don't know.

20:01.092 --> 20:03.034
You seem like someone
who enjoys a challenge.

20:03.261 --> 20:04.944
Yeah, Oscar challenges me.

20:05.096 --> 20:06.687
He challenges me plenty.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.431
All right.

20:08.449 --> 20:09.540
Just checkin'.

20:10.435 --> 20:12.601
So you wouldn't want to
grab dinner sometime?

20:12.603 --> 20:13.860
Just the two of us?

20:13.955 --> 20:15.671
We can keep it a secret.

20:17.124 --> 20:18.633
Absolutely not.

20:19.961 --> 20:21.636
See you around, Kitty Kat.

20:29.287 --> 20:31.395
That was a challenge.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.885
NICK:
Your mom was right.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.989
You do have a crush on me.

20:42.817 --> 20:44.242
Shut up and kiss me.

20:47.822 --> 20:49.997
(gasps)

20:52.977 --> 20:54.502
Uh-oh.
