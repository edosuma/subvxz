[Jimmy] Ian!

00:10.000 --> 00:10.504
-Ian!

00:10.544 --> 00:11.980
-[door closes]

00:12.020 --> 00:13.098
Is that you playing silly

00:13.138 --> 00:14.338
bollocks downstairs?

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
Ian!

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
[gun clicking]

00:25.000 --> 00:26.140
[Kim] Hello, Jimmy.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
Remember me?

00:30.000 --> 00:32.980
Um...

00:33.020 --> 00:34.980
You killed my dad.

00:35.020 --> 00:37.032
Yeah, you might need to narrow

00:37.072 --> 00:37.980
it down a bit.

00:38.020 --> 00:39.980
Okay, how's this?

00:40.020 --> 00:42.000
His name...

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
[hammer clicks]

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
was Bill Noakes.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.103
Was he, like, this

00:52.143 --> 00:52.980
little fella--

00:53.020 --> 00:53.980
Oh, for God's sake!

00:54.020 --> 00:54.980
Don't shout at me, I'm trying

00:55.020 --> 00:56.760
to remember, I'm getting old!

00:57.000 --> 00:58.980
[sighs]

00:59.020 --> 00:59.554
Do you have, like, a picture

00:59.594 --> 00:59.980
of him, or something?

01:00.020 --> 01:01.980
Not on me, no!

01:02.020 --> 01:03.046
I wasn't exactly planning

01:03.086 --> 01:03.980
on doing this tonight.

01:04.020 --> 01:05.980
[sighs]

01:06.020 --> 01:07.460
I've got one in the car.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.150
-Do you wanna go and get it?

01:09.190 --> 01:09.980
-No! Come on, think.

01:10.020 --> 01:11.980
Bill Noakes?

01:12.020 --> 01:14.000
You know, the thing is...

01:15.000 --> 01:16.638
it might be easier for you

01:16.678 --> 01:17.980
to exact your revenge

01:18.020 --> 01:19.283
if you weren't standing...

01:19.323 --> 01:20.163
on a trapdoor!

01:22.000 --> 01:23.156
-[gasping]

01:23.196 --> 01:23.980
-Idiot!

01:24.020 --> 01:25.062
Who's got a trapdoor in their

01:25.102 --> 01:26.602
house, anyway, you plank?

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
d

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
I do.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.205
[music playing faintly

01:34.245 --> 01:35.085
on car stereo]

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Where the fuck is she, man?

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Un-fucking-believable.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
[beeping]

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
[exhales]

01:57.000 --> 01:58.080
She's only little.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Wotcher.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.980
Now, if I was you,

02:10.020 --> 02:13.000
I would mind my step, treacle.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.980
Thanks, honey.

02:17.020 --> 02:18.980
Why don't you mind yours?

02:19.020 --> 02:19.529
That makes no sense

02:19.569 --> 02:19.980
at all, does it?

02:20.020 --> 02:21.045
I mean, I'm the one walking

02:21.085 --> 02:21.470
forwards, you're the one

02:21.510 --> 02:21.980
walking backwards.

02:22.020 --> 02:22.485
Why would I need

02:22.525 --> 02:22.980
to mind my step?

02:23.020 --> 02:24.003
So no one's ever fallen

02:24.043 --> 02:24.627
walking forwards then,

02:24.667 --> 02:24.980
have they?

02:25.020 --> 02:26.131
Kind of unlikely in this

02:26.171 --> 02:27.251
kind of situation.

02:28.000 --> 02:28.524
Okay, yeah, so it's

02:28.564 --> 02:28.980
highly unlikely,

02:29.020 --> 02:30.054
but I'm saying, stranger

02:30.094 --> 02:30.980
things have happened.

02:31.020 --> 02:31.486
-You watch your step.

02:31.526 --> 02:31.980
-You watch your step!

02:32.020 --> 02:33.980
God, you're annoying.

02:34.020 --> 02:34.980
You're annoying. Now, back off.

02:35.020 --> 02:36.011
Look, I don't want

02:36.051 --> 02:36.980
blood everywhere.

02:37.020 --> 02:38.938
I've just spent a shitload

02:38.978 --> 02:39.980
on decorating.

02:40.020 --> 02:40.593
-[Kim] It's nice.

02:40.633 --> 02:40.980
-Thank you.

02:41.020 --> 02:42.011
So what do you say

02:42.051 --> 02:43.071
that you and I...

02:44.000 --> 02:45.980
have ourselves a little tumble?

02:46.020 --> 02:49.980
No guns. No knives. Eh?

02:50.020 --> 02:52.980
To the death, though, right?

02:53.020 --> 02:54.980
Yes, to the fucking death!

02:55.020 --> 02:55.980
Jesus.

02:56.020 --> 02:57.624
I thought it might

02:57.664 --> 02:58.241
get a bit grim,

02:58.281 --> 02:58.980
that's all.

02:59.020 --> 03:00.980
You know, hand to hand.

03:01.020 --> 03:02.152
Then maybe that's why

03:02.192 --> 03:03.092
they call me...

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
the Grim Reaper.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.053
Or maybe you're about to reap

03:10.093 --> 03:11.000
what you sow.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.243
Oh, that's a really nice

03:14.283 --> 03:14.510
exchange that,

03:14.550 --> 03:14.980
I like that.

03:15.020 --> 03:16.180
-Yeah, it just felt organic.

03:16.220 --> 03:16.980
-It did, didn't it?

03:17.020 --> 03:18.000
Ah...

03:20.000 --> 03:20.980
[guns clicking]

03:21.020 --> 03:22.441
Well, go on then.

03:22.481 --> 03:23.980
Put your gun down.

03:24.020 --> 03:25.980
You put your gun down.

03:26.020 --> 03:27.880
[softly] You put your gun down.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.104
All right, we'll put them

03:30.144 --> 03:31.070
down together. Nice...

03:31.110 --> 03:32.000
Nice and slow.

[grunting]

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
[spits]

04:12.000 --> 04:13.980
So Beth looks up,

04:14.020 --> 04:16.215
fixes me square in the eye

04:16.255 --> 04:16.980
and says,

04:17.020 --> 04:19.499
"Jay, you have got the most

04:19.539 --> 04:20.980
gorgeous balls."

04:21.020 --> 04:21.980
Ugh. Fuck off.

04:22.020 --> 04:22.980
She did, bro, I swear.

04:23.020 --> 04:24.980
No bloke's got gorgeous balls.

04:25.020 --> 04:26.980
Okay, mine are disgusting.

04:27.020 --> 04:27.685
I'm just gonna put that

04:27.725 --> 04:27.980
out there.

04:28.020 --> 04:28.980
I have repulsive balls.

04:29.020 --> 04:30.040
Of course you do.

04:31.000 --> 04:31.980
All balls are disgusting.

04:32.020 --> 04:32.995
They're the kind of balls only

04:33.035 --> 04:33.980
a mother could find gorgeous.

04:34.020 --> 04:35.107
[Jay] I agree with you!

04:35.147 --> 04:36.227
Mine are horrible.

[Jay] I bet even David Beckham

05:37.091 --> 05:37.980
hasn't got gorgeous balls,

05:38.020 --> 05:39.520
and his balls are golden.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.206
Oh, yeah. No one's doubting

05:41.246 --> 05:41.413
the golden hue of

05:41.453 --> 05:41.980
a Beckham bollock,

05:42.020 --> 05:43.788
but that's where the aesthetic

beauty of them comes

05:44.346 --> 05:44.980
to a swift end,

05:45.020 --> 05:45.980
do you know what I mean?

05:46.020 --> 05:47.122
-She said it though, man.

05:47.162 --> 05:47.980
-Well, she's lying.

05:48.020 --> 05:49.657
Ha, no! Beth never lies.

05:49.697 --> 05:50.045
She's like a priest

05:50.085 --> 05:50.980
or the League table.

05:51.020 --> 05:52.486
-She's like Shakira's hips.

05:52.526 --> 05:52.980
-Exactly.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.547
That's how I knew we were

05:54.587 --> 05:55.052
going to spend the rest

05:55.092 --> 05:56.412
of our lives together.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
What?

06:00.000 --> 06:01.980
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

You think it's a bad idea,

don't you?

07:42.020 --> 07:43.645
I guess the only thing is,

07:43.685 --> 07:44.980
it's been six months.

07:45.020 --> 07:46.298
Yeah, but it's like Dad

07:46.338 --> 07:46.980
used to say.

07:47.020 --> 07:47.980
When you know, you know.

07:48.020 --> 07:49.132
Yeah, but you think you know

07:49.172 --> 07:49.980
things but you don't.

07:50.020 --> 07:51.297
That's kind of, like,

07:51.337 --> 07:51.980
your thing.

07:52.020 --> 07:52.603
Yeah, but I'm not saying

07:52.643 --> 07:53.543
I think I know,

07:54.000 --> 07:54.980
I'm saying I know I know.

07:55.020 --> 07:56.433
And when you know you know

07:56.473 --> 07:57.688
something, you just know it,

07:57.728 --> 07:57.980
innit?

07:58.020 --> 07:59.105
No, because the second piece

07:59.145 --> 07:59.980
of knowledge relies on

08:00.020 --> 08:00.985
the first one being

08:01.025 --> 08:01.980
factually accurate,

08:02.020 --> 08:02.720
which I'm saying it might

08:02.760 --> 08:02.980
not be...

08:03.020 --> 08:03.678
Mate, just because you've

08:03.718 --> 08:03.980
been dumped

08:04.020 --> 08:05.860
it doesn't mean the rest of us

08:05.900 --> 08:06.141

08:06.181 --> 08:06.980

-Yeah. Well...

08:15.020 --> 08:17.094
I hate to break it to you,

08:17.134 --> 08:17.980
kid, but...

08:18.020 --> 08:18.661
she's thinks it's the end

08:18.701 --> 08:19.421
of the world

08:20.000 --> 08:21.116
and she's run off to some

08:21.156 --> 08:21.980
rich geezer's house

08:22.020 --> 08:23.980
in the middle of the night.

08:24.020 --> 08:24.980
What do you think's happening?

She's blatantly in there

08:41.020 --> 08:43.000
now you're going to die in it.

08:44.000 --> 08:44.980
Please do not tell me

08:45.020 --> 08:46.317
you dragged me all the way

08:46.357 --> 08:46.390
up the stairs

08:46.430 --> 08:47.450
just to say that.

08:48.000 --> 08:48.980
Yes.

08:49.020 --> 08:50.422
-It's fucking terrible.

-Shut up!

Shit! Fuck! Sorry. I'm sorry.

09:01.020 --> 09:02.090
I mean, it feels like

09:02.130 --> 09:02.426
you're doing this

09:02.466 --> 09:02.980
on purpose now.

09:03.020 --> 09:03.738
I swear to God, I'm not!

09:03.778 --> 09:03.980
I'm not!

09:04.020 --> 09:06.000
f

09:08.000 --> 09:09.347
I watched him bleed to death

09:09.387 --> 09:10.167
on the floor.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.820
Your mistake was leaving me

09:13.860 --> 09:15.000
alive that night.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.740
You shouldn't have done that.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Oh.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.140
Oh, I remember you.

You're Little Miss Penguin,

ain't you?

happened to you.

09:39.020 --> 09:41.980
Yes, well... now you know.

It was a bit mean

09:43.089 --> 09:43.980
of you, though,

killing that geezer outside.

09:45.360 --> 09:46.200
You know, Ian.

09:47.000 --> 09:47.980
What did he do?

09:48.020 --> 09:49.011
It's a moot point,

09:49.051 --> 09:49.980
though, isn't it?

09:50.020 --> 09:52.000
We're all dead anyway.

09:53.000 --> 09:53.947
Put the news on.

20:53.404 --> 20:54.124
on my heart.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.980
God, he's a sweetheart!

20:59.020 --> 21:00.127
If we help this guy,

21:00.167 --> 21:00.293
we're all going

21:00.333 --> 21:01.473
to prison for this.

21:02.000 --> 21:02.980
You know that, don't you?

21:03.020 --> 21:04.011
If it comes to it,

21:04.051 --> 21:04.980
I take the blame.

21:05.020 --> 21:06.160
I promise you that.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.364
But saving Ian is the right

21:09.404 --> 21:10.124
thing to do.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.980
[sighs]

21:15.020 --> 21:16.827
Okay. You call the hospital

21:16.867 --> 21:17.127
and let them know

21:17.167 --> 21:17.980
that we're coming.

21:18.020 --> 21:18.980
I'll dash to the car quickly

21:19.020 --> 21:19.980
and get it all set up for Ian.

21:20.020 --> 21:23.980
Sure, Kim. Car. Dash. Ian!

21:24.020 --> 21:25.000
Kim Kardashian!

21:30.000 --> 21:31.173
Okay, we're in a rush,

21:31.213 --> 21:31.980
so don't worry,

21:32.020 --> 21:32.572
but remind me to explain

21:32.612 --> 21:32.980
that to you later

21:33.020 --> 21:34.711
because that's probably the

21:34.751 --> 21:35.271
best thing I've said

21:35.311 --> 21:35.980
in, like, ever.

21:36.020 --> 21:37.487
Sorry. What do you mean,

21:37.527 --> 21:37.980
"later"?

21:38.020 --> 21:39.573
Oh... I just thought because

21:39.613 --> 21:40.980
of the whole, you know...

21:41.020 --> 21:42.122
I told you, that kiss

21:42.162 --> 21:42.980
was for my list.

21:43.020 --> 21:44.122
Just like everything else

21:44.162 --> 21:45.302
was supposed to be.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.980
I was so excited.

21:49.020 --> 21:50.357
But then you lied to me,

21:50.397 --> 21:50.980
didn't you?

21:51.020 --> 21:53.000
And now it's all ruined.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.180
I just think a bit of moral

21:56.220 --> 21:56.980
relativism would--

21:57.020 --> 21:58.000
I'm glad we met.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
I really am.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.535
But when you lie to someone,

22:03.575 --> 22:04.308
you squeeze the toothpaste

22:04.348 --> 22:05.308
out of the tube.

22:07.000 --> 22:07.567
And you can't put it

22:07.607 --> 22:08.447
back in again.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.020
Now hang on, son.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
Just wait.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.980
In that room through there,

22:34.020 --> 22:36.980
there's 500 grand in cash

22:37.020 --> 22:38.980
hidden in the fireplace.

22:39.020 --> 22:40.235
There's plenty more where

22:40.275 --> 22:40.980
that came from.

22:41.020 --> 22:44.000
Just... don't kill me, please.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.168
This was to make you more

22:48.208 --> 22:49.228
comfortable, Ian!

22:50.000 --> 22:51.150
Oh, I thought you were gonna

22:51.190 --> 22:52.390
smother me to death.

22:53.000 --> 22:53.980
-No!

22:54.020 --> 22:54.980
-Oh!

22:55.020 --> 22:55.980
Thank you.

22:56.020 --> 22:57.760
No, you're not having it now.

23:00.000 --> 23:00.980
Where you going?

23:01.020 --> 23:01.980
Where do you think?

23:02.020 --> 23:03.298
I was only joking about

23:03.338 --> 23:03.980
the money...

23:04.020 --> 23:05.000
[winces]

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
Shittetty-shit.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.980
Hello, darling.

23:25.020 --> 23:27.000
[Kim grunting]

23:28.000 --> 23:29.706
I don't understand why you need

23:29.746 --> 23:30.448
to brush your teeth now

23:30.488 --> 23:30.980
anyway, kid.

23:31.020 --> 23:32.111
We're kind of in the middle

23:32.151 --> 23:32.980
of some serious shit.

23:33.020 --> 23:33.980
What? No, Jay, it's a metaphor.

23:34.020 --> 23:35.852
It means you can't undo

23:35.892 --> 23:36.131
something once

23:36.171 --> 23:36.980
you've done it.

23:37.020 --> 23:39.198
It's like, you can't tell a lie

23:39.238 --> 23:40.000
and then...

23:44.000 --> 23:44.980
[Ian] Oi! You two!

23:45.020 --> 23:47.000
Come and look at this! Quick!

23:51.000 --> 23:52.229
[Nicky] Whoa, whoa, whoa,

23:52.269 --> 23:52.980
what you doing?

23:53.020 --> 23:53.980
Put it back, man!

23:54.020 --> 23:54.980
Fuck off.

23:55.020 --> 23:56.195
We just need to get Ian

23:56.235 --> 23:56.980
to the hospital

23:57.020 --> 23:58.046
and our story straight to

23:58.086 --> 23:58.980
the police. That's it.

23:59.020 --> 23:59.509
Okay. And what if we go

23:59.549 --> 23:59.727
to the police and Kim

23:59.767 --> 24:00.727
blames it on us?

24:01.000 --> 24:01.774
She's not going to do that,

24:01.814 --> 24:01.980
is she?

24:02.020 --> 24:02.398
-[Ian] Guys!

24:02.438 --> 24:02.980
-How do you know?

24:03.020 --> 24:04.072
Because honesty is,

24:04.112 --> 24:04.980
like, her thing.

24:05.020 --> 24:06.980
Bro, you don't even know her!

24:07.020 --> 24:07.695
-I know her well enough.

24:07.735 --> 24:07.742
All right?

24:07.782 --> 24:07.980
-[Ian] Guys!

24:08.020 --> 24:10.000
[both] Yes, Ian?

24:11.000 --> 24:11.980
Jeez!

24:12.020 --> 24:13.820
Right little moaner, isn't he?

24:15.000 --> 24:15.980
What do you want, man?

24:16.020 --> 24:17.230
Isn't she supposed to be taking

24:17.270 --> 24:18.410
me to the hospital?
