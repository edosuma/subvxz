WEBVTT

00:12.411 --> 00:14.238
Yeah!

00:24.798 --> 00:27.087
Yeah.

00:31.805 --> 00:33.632
Yeah!

00:43.233 --> 00:45.143
- Big air!
- Whoo!

00:54.787 --> 00:57.194
Whoo! Oh, yeah.

01:02.086 --> 01:03.117
Hey.

01:05.673 --> 01:06.704
What's this guy doing?

01:09.009 --> 01:10.918
- My God, he's out of control!
- Look out!

01:15.557 --> 01:17.325
Turn him over. Help me.

01:17.349 --> 01:18.608
He's not breathing.

01:18.632 --> 01:20.221
Open his vest.

01:25.150 --> 01:26.371
He's been shot!

01:26.395 --> 01:28.561
Call 911. I need some help.

01:29.321 --> 01:30.899
Help!

01:51.552 --> 01:53.319
I'm still looking for a place.

01:53.343 --> 01:55.944
- You could live on a boat.
- I tried that.

01:55.968 --> 01:58.820
- When?
- When I moved back from Long Beach.

01:58.844 --> 02:01.282
Oh, come on,
that was on the dry dock, G.

02:01.306 --> 02:04.289
- It hadn't sailed for over 20 years.
- Still a boat.

02:04.313 --> 02:06.117
I'm talking about a real boat.

02:06.141 --> 02:07.537
In a marina.

02:07.561 --> 02:09.750
Ocean breezes,
morning jogs on the beach.

02:09.774 --> 02:13.124
- Do you know someone with a boat?
- Renko has a boat.

02:13.148 --> 02:15.588
Renko knows nothing about boats.

02:15.612 --> 02:17.492
Thirty-footer. Ask him.

02:20.247 --> 02:21.445
- Morning, Kensi.
- What's up?

02:22.166 --> 02:23.600
Sam.

02:23.624 --> 02:25.203
Hey.

02:27.755 --> 02:30.328
So are you finished filming me
with your cell phone, Dom?

02:31.717 --> 02:33.152
How did you know I wasn't texting?

02:33.176 --> 02:35.111
Because you kept checking
if he was looking.

02:35.135 --> 02:37.189
Dead giveaway, Dom.

02:37.213 --> 02:39.239
I took our undercover course.

02:39.263 --> 02:41.152
- You pass?
- Yes.

02:41.176 --> 02:43.640
I'm a fully qualified NCIS agent.

02:45.397 --> 02:46.998
Well, don't worry about it, Dom.

02:47.022 --> 02:49.408
There are still some things
you have to learn on the job.

02:49.432 --> 02:53.085
Yeah, with a knife closely pressed
against your ear by a bad guy

02:53.109 --> 02:54.905
who is convinced you are a cop.

02:56.742 --> 02:59.635
No, no, but seriously, like,
what happened to the other agent?

02:59.659 --> 03:01.429
The guy that I replaced?

03:01.453 --> 03:03.092
He had a problem with the weather.

03:03.116 --> 03:04.594
- Too windy.
- Too hot.

03:04.618 --> 03:09.003
Hot and windy, dry,
desert-air type thing and allergies.

03:13.383 --> 03:15.352
I guess they're still working
on your office?

03:15.376 --> 03:17.900
- Yep.
- Know when it's gonna be ready?

03:17.924 --> 03:19.732
- I don't know.
- Who knows?

03:19.756 --> 03:21.022
Hetty.

03:21.046 --> 03:22.909
You wanna ask her?

03:22.933 --> 03:24.726
You're armed. You ask her.

03:26.939 --> 03:28.290
You're the psychologist.

03:28.314 --> 03:31.625
I've been trained to profile
suspects and brief you guys.

03:31.649 --> 03:35.080
In the three years of college, two more
years to get my masters and doctorate,

03:35.104 --> 03:37.688
when it comes to Hetty, clueless.

03:40.410 --> 03:41.631
Yeah.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.133
Hi, Hetty.

03:43.157 --> 03:44.872
Yeah, l... Yeah. What?

03:45.374 --> 03:47.058
I'II, uh... I'll send them right up.

03:47.082 --> 03:48.828
Bye.

03:49.628 --> 03:51.786
Ops room.
You've all been summoned.

03:53.382 --> 03:54.793
Do you think she heard me?

03:55.425 --> 03:57.252
Probably.

04:01.932 --> 04:05.656
The man on the Jet Ski
is Daniel Su.

04:05.680 --> 04:09.032
Two weeks ago,
his company received funding

04:09.056 --> 04:12.410
from the Defense Research
Project Agency.

04:12.434 --> 04:16.310
Better known mercifully as DARPA.

04:19.992 --> 04:21.591
Mr. Su was shot.

04:21.616 --> 04:23.754
He died on the way to the hospital.

04:23.778 --> 04:27.215
There is great consternation
in the Pentagon.

04:27.239 --> 04:32.599
SECNAV has promised swift action
to determine who killed him and why.

04:32.623 --> 04:36.188
They're afraid it could be
the North Koreans.

04:36.212 --> 04:39.894
Mr. Su defected from there
five years ago.

04:39.918 --> 04:42.111
This is all in the file.

04:42.135 --> 04:44.014
Let me know what you require.

04:45.309 --> 04:46.340
Eric.

04:47.477 --> 04:50.977
This is not the beach,
this is the office.

04:53.525 --> 04:54.699
Epic swell this afternoon.

04:54.723 --> 04:57.499
Living dangerously, Eric.

04:57.523 --> 05:00.875
- File's up.
- Thank you. Okay.

05:00.899 --> 05:04.585
So why would the North Koreans wait
five years before coming after this guy?

05:04.609 --> 05:06.470
The DARPA contract probably.

05:06.494 --> 05:08.383
It made him more visible.

05:08.407 --> 05:10.467
He was an electronics engineer.

05:10.491 --> 05:14.226
Single,
just bought a house in Koreatown.

05:14.250 --> 05:15.536
One brother, Jimmy Su.

05:16.048 --> 05:19.309
He has his doctorate in
engineering and applied science.

05:19.333 --> 05:21.976
Now working on a lightweight
squad-based communication system

05:22.000 --> 05:24.313
- for the Marine Corps.
- This looks interesting.

05:24.337 --> 05:26.898
He rented a Jet Ski
from the same place at the same time

05:26.922 --> 05:29.556
every Monday, Thursday
and Saturday morning.

05:30.437 --> 05:31.611
A creature of habit.

05:31.635 --> 05:33.853
And somebody knew it.

05:34.066 --> 05:36.189
They were waiting for him.

05:46.453 --> 05:47.923
Is that a comic book you're reading?

05:47.947 --> 05:49.129
Uh, no.

05:49.153 --> 05:52.224
No, it's a, uh, graphic novel.

05:52.248 --> 05:53.887
- Heh.
- Oh.

05:53.911 --> 05:54.911
May I?

05:56.421 --> 05:58.686
It's a commentary
on humanity's struggle

05:58.710 --> 06:03.401
to differentiate between right and
wrong when the social fabric of society

06:03.425 --> 06:06.406
is torn asunder
by technological change.

06:06.430 --> 06:09.599
All that is explained in pictures?

06:10.143 --> 06:14.069
I would have thought you could find
something more stimulating

06:14.093 --> 06:17.226
to read on your break.

06:18.610 --> 06:23.605
But personally,
I'm clueless about these things.

06:27.035 --> 06:29.253
How's Dominic settling in?

06:29.277 --> 06:31.613
Oh. Um...

06:32.290 --> 06:33.974
Anxious to prove himself.

06:33.998 --> 06:35.970
Oh, aren't they all?

06:35.994 --> 06:40.962
Does he know the three agents
before him didn't pass muster?

06:42.050 --> 06:43.050
No.

06:43.635 --> 06:46.019
Best that he doesn't, I think.

06:46.043 --> 06:47.228
Yeah.

06:47.252 --> 06:49.139
Yeah.

07:11.246 --> 07:14.140
- Daniel Su live alone?
- According to the file.

07:14.164 --> 07:16.515
Home address and the office address
are the same.

07:16.539 --> 07:17.848
It's a startup.

07:17.872 --> 07:19.764
Probably worked out of his garage.

07:19.788 --> 07:21.398
No L.A.P.D. Yet.

07:21.422 --> 07:22.645
In and out then.

07:22.669 --> 07:25.047
Save the paperwork.

08:22.108 --> 08:23.389
Upstairs is clear.

08:23.902 --> 08:25.100
Clear.

08:26.571 --> 08:27.947
Back door is locked.

08:32.660 --> 08:34.071
We got a bloody lamp.

08:47.509 --> 08:49.300
Got a body.

09:03.966 --> 09:06.942
Victim is Sally Morris.
She was Daniel Su's business partner.

09:06.966 --> 09:08.819
Susal Technologies. Okay.

09:08.843 --> 09:12.274
She was the money. Bank rolled
Su's startup for a 50 percent stake.

09:12.298 --> 09:13.944
Small company,
just the two of them.

09:13.968 --> 09:18.033
With the DARPA contract,
all of that would have been changed.

09:18.057 --> 09:22.583
Maybe it wasn't the North Koreans.
It could have been a business rival.

09:22.607 --> 09:24.330
Or a jealous lover.

09:24.354 --> 09:26.662
No, I checked that
to see if there was either.

09:26.686 --> 09:29.924
Preliminary autopsy report
on Daniel Su. Hot off the fax.

09:29.948 --> 09:32.666
Bullet hit him high in the chest,
travelling right to left.

09:32.690 --> 09:34.755
Missed his heart
by about a quarter of an inch.

09:34.779 --> 09:38.134
His, uh, life jacket acted
like a compression bandage.

09:38.158 --> 09:40.077
And that slowed the bleeding,

09:40.627 --> 09:42.121
but not enough.

09:45.007 --> 09:48.091
Bullet path
took a downward trajectory.

09:48.385 --> 09:50.270
The shooter was firing from above.

09:50.294 --> 09:53.068
At a moving target on a Jet Ski.

09:53.092 --> 09:56.800
Hmm. Shooter's got talent.

10:05.777 --> 10:07.461
Trailer park.

10:07.485 --> 10:09.587
You want me to live in a trailer park?

10:09.611 --> 10:12.331
I'm talking about an RV.
One of those triple pop-outs.

10:12.355 --> 10:14.088
It's like a mansion on wheels.

10:14.112 --> 10:16.005
If you wanna move,
you can just drive away.

10:16.029 --> 10:19.763
They have places all along the coast
where you can just camp out.

10:19.787 --> 10:21.309
I don't know, l...

10:21.333 --> 10:23.470
I think I like the boat idea better.

10:23.494 --> 10:25.105
I can just kind of sail off.

10:25.129 --> 10:26.553
Do you know how to sail?

10:26.577 --> 10:28.833
- No.
- Well, that could be a problem.

10:33.221 --> 10:35.523
This is where Daniel Su hit.

10:35.547 --> 10:37.266
Yep.

10:37.684 --> 10:40.531
He rented the Jet Ski in the marina,

10:40.555 --> 10:42.532
came around
through the entrance there.

10:42.556 --> 10:45.661
Now, there's a speed limit. Probably
five miles an hour at the entrance.

10:45.685 --> 10:47.792
You need to know that
in case you're gonna sail.

10:47.816 --> 10:50.453
- Five miles an hour. Got that.
- Heh.

10:50.477 --> 10:53.253
That's where our shooter made
the shot. While he was going slow.

10:53.277 --> 10:55.253
Must have accelerated,
tried to make it back.

10:55.277 --> 10:56.615
Nobody heard anything.

10:57.120 --> 10:59.089
No gunshot on the videotape.

10:59.113 --> 11:00.724
Silencer.

11:00.748 --> 11:03.786
Bullet goes right to left,
downward trajectory.

11:04.294 --> 11:06.121
That's where I'd be.

11:07.714 --> 11:09.932
Clean line of sight to the target.

11:09.956 --> 11:12.173
Good concealment.

11:13.178 --> 11:16.179
The mast is rocking.
The target's bobbing and moving.

11:16.681 --> 11:18.970
That's a damn good shot, G.

11:24.898 --> 11:26.119
Eric?

11:26.143 --> 11:27.537
Yeah, east to the breakwater,

11:27.561 --> 11:29.999
there's a security camera
overlooking the marina.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.247
You're gonna need to access
that hard drive.

11:32.271 --> 11:34.961
I narrowed it down to the hour
before the shooting.

11:34.985 --> 11:38.384
Give the shooter time
to get into position, settle in.

11:38.408 --> 11:41.970
I would have carried the rifle
in a tackle box or a cooler.

11:41.994 --> 11:44.513
Just another guy going fishing.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.501
There's a guy with a tackle box
right there.

11:47.629 --> 11:50.274
Walked right past the boat.
Strike one.

11:50.298 --> 11:51.628
How about the guy in the hat?

11:53.593 --> 11:55.111
Going in the opposite direction.

11:55.135 --> 11:56.560
Strike two.

11:56.584 --> 11:57.770
No.

11:57.794 --> 11:59.348
That's him.

11:59.891 --> 12:01.445
Sam, he's going towards
the parking lot.

12:01.469 --> 12:03.825
Watch.
He's taking the long way around.

12:03.849 --> 12:05.740
Scope things out.

12:05.764 --> 12:07.658
That's what I'd do.

12:07.682 --> 12:09.328
He's in no hurry.

12:09.352 --> 12:12.313
He's got another 45 minutes
before Su arrives.

12:12.821 --> 12:14.612
Look at that. He's back.

12:16.324 --> 12:18.507
All right. Resolution is not good.

12:18.531 --> 12:21.928
But now that we know
what our guy is wearing,

12:21.952 --> 12:24.613
all we need to do...

12:24.833 --> 12:27.976
All right, I got it. There's another
camera in the marina parking lot.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.475
I'm accessing the hard drives
for the hour after the shooting.

12:32.499 --> 12:34.975
We're not gonna need an hour.

12:34.999 --> 12:38.937
Five minutes after he made that shot,
he was in his car on his way home.

12:38.961 --> 12:40.739
Good call. There he is.

12:40.763 --> 12:42.782
Three minutes after the shooting.

12:42.806 --> 12:44.304
Zoom and enhance.

12:46.396 --> 12:48.104
Hmm. It's a woman.

12:48.732 --> 12:51.413
He's a woman.
I mean, she's a woman.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.187
She looks Asian.

12:53.862 --> 12:55.570
She is.

12:56.114 --> 12:58.462
Her name is Lee Wuan Kai.

12:58.486 --> 13:03.154
And we are in a whole pile of trouble.

13:13.522 --> 13:18.206
Lee Wuan Kai flew into Los Angeles
a week ago on a fake passport.

13:18.230 --> 13:21.331
By the time her passport
was flagged by ICE, she was gone.

13:21.355 --> 13:23.794
Eric, NCIS server.

13:23.818 --> 13:26.030
Watch list. Lee Wuan Kai.

13:30.914 --> 13:32.953
These passport photos
are our best lead.

13:33.458 --> 13:36.103
But she can and she does
change her appearance.

13:36.127 --> 13:37.575
North Korean.

13:38.630 --> 13:41.062
She's a fanatical nationalist.

13:41.086 --> 13:44.508
Who, as far as we can tell,
hasn't been home in three decades.

13:45.387 --> 13:47.095
She's an assassin in exile.

13:47.597 --> 13:49.530
She's based in Eastern Europe
somewhere.

13:49.554 --> 13:51.693
Do not underestimate this woman.

13:51.717 --> 13:54.384
She will not give you
a second chance.

13:55.355 --> 13:57.680
Callen, Sam.

14:00.318 --> 14:01.919
Local DARPA analysts
are gonna brief you

14:01.943 --> 14:05.208
on the technical aspects
of Daniel Su's DARPA contract.

14:05.232 --> 14:07.340
Meeting is in 15 minutes
at the safe house.

14:07.364 --> 14:08.755
His name is Frank Davis.

14:08.779 --> 14:10.470
Kai could be halfway home by now.

14:10.494 --> 14:11.883
- But she isn't, is she?
- No.

14:11.907 --> 14:14.843
This isn't technology that
Daniel Su started after he defected.

14:14.867 --> 14:18.137
It started as a classified project
for the North Korean Army.

14:18.161 --> 14:20.934
Su kept a lot of the software secrets
under wraps.

14:20.958 --> 14:23.598
Kai will kill anybody she thinks
he shared those secrets with.

14:23.622 --> 14:26.397
If they can't have the technology,
then nobody else does either.

14:26.421 --> 14:28.065
That explains
the Sally Morris murder.

14:28.089 --> 14:30.611
DARPA's got another list of people
she might come after.

14:30.635 --> 14:34.318
- He's got a brother.
- Jimmy Su. Married, no other family.

14:34.342 --> 14:38.078
He's refusing protection, but he insists
on staying holed up in his house.

14:38.102 --> 14:40.158
We got a couple of units out front.

14:40.182 --> 14:43.359
This is one fight
Kai is not gonna win.

14:46.489 --> 14:48.008
I think he's met her before.

14:48.032 --> 14:49.777
Yeah.

14:50.368 --> 14:51.910
And she won.

14:53.330 --> 14:55.631
How's the lady in charge
this morning?

14:55.655 --> 14:58.180
If I'd known you were coming, Leon,

14:58.204 --> 15:02.302
I would have bought
some chao hung pao tea.

15:02.326 --> 15:04.889
And if I'd known I was coming,
Henrietta,

15:04.913 --> 15:08.567
I would have bought you that Emilio
Pucci scarf you've always wanted.

15:08.591 --> 15:12.735
You've been threatening to buy that
for me for 10 years, Leon.

15:12.759 --> 15:14.640
- Eleven. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

15:16.519 --> 15:18.618
Are you getting settled
into the new office?

15:18.642 --> 15:20.912
Oh... Heh.

15:20.936 --> 15:24.061
- I just bring it all with me.
- Ha-ha-ha.

15:24.611 --> 15:27.160
It's not the outside that matters,

15:27.184 --> 15:28.858
- it's the inside.
- Hmm.

15:31.534 --> 15:34.714
That was taken on the set
for Inchon.

15:34.738 --> 15:40.393
Olivier and I used to have
the most wonderful chats.

15:40.417 --> 15:45.804
I was, uh, responsible for his uniform.
He played General MacArthur.

15:45.828 --> 15:47.810
Korean War.

15:47.834 --> 15:49.859
Funny, that.

15:49.883 --> 15:52.259
Given the current circumstances.

15:54.599 --> 15:56.259
Is there anything you don't know?

15:58.353 --> 16:02.481
Oh, many, many things, I'm sure.

16:05.068 --> 16:07.191
It's her, isn't it?

16:07.737 --> 16:10.193
- Kai?
- Yeah.

16:12.283 --> 16:16.661
I first met her in Prague in 1984.

16:17.706 --> 16:20.173
Then in Tokyo seven years later.

16:20.197 --> 16:23.210
Three times since then.

16:23.628 --> 16:25.585
Sierra Leone,

16:26.256 --> 16:28.213
Paris and New York City.

16:28.883 --> 16:31.635
She left a body count every time.

16:32.804 --> 16:35.425
I should have been in that count
in Prague.

16:36.099 --> 16:38.222
I was green. I got lucky.

16:39.144 --> 16:42.098
Is she your nemesis, Leon?

16:42.564 --> 16:44.687
Only if she buries me.

16:45.316 --> 16:49.160
Then we must ensure
that doesn't happen.

16:49.184 --> 16:51.651
Well,
at least until you get your scarf.

16:55.869 --> 16:58.466
Sally Morris arrives
at Jimmy Su's place for work.

16:58.490 --> 17:01.011
She discovers Kai
turning the place over.

17:01.035 --> 17:05.122
She tries to get away
and Kai whacks her with the lamp.

17:06.087 --> 17:08.103
It's a really odd weapon for a pro.

17:08.127 --> 17:10.646
It was the first thing at hand.

17:10.670 --> 17:11.933
Crime scene analysis?

17:11.957 --> 17:13.356
Tomorrow at the earliest.

17:13.380 --> 17:15.344
It's too long.

17:20.977 --> 17:22.031
Lab.

17:22.056 --> 17:24.530
Miss Sciuto, I hope I haven't
called at a bad time.

17:24.554 --> 17:25.738
Hi, Leon.

17:25.762 --> 17:27.493
I'm just doing an experiment.

17:27.518 --> 17:28.949
What sort of experiment?

17:28.973 --> 17:32.735
With light. Well, dark actually.

17:35.074 --> 17:36.117
Aah.

17:40.413 --> 17:43.390
You know, though technically
darkness is the absence of light,

17:43.414 --> 17:46.833
so I guess it should be called
"lightlessness," don't you think?

17:47.545 --> 17:49.181
Good luck with the experiment.

17:49.205 --> 17:50.934
I need you to look at some spatter.

17:50.958 --> 17:53.101
Oh, I love spatter.

17:53.125 --> 17:56.611
You're the expert.
That's why I'm sending it to you.

17:56.635 --> 17:58.903
- Hey, are you still in L.A.?
- Yes, I am.

17:58.927 --> 18:00.641
Would you say hi to Eric for me?

18:01.142 --> 18:04.119
Well, you can say hello yourself.
He'll send you the files.

18:04.143 --> 18:05.866
So, what am I looking for?

18:05.890 --> 18:08.745
I'll be happy with whatever
you can find, Miss Sciuto.

18:08.769 --> 18:10.412
I need you on it right away.

18:10.436 --> 18:11.890
I see the light.

18:13.947 --> 18:15.275
That was a joke, Leon.

18:16.032 --> 18:17.740
Here's Eric.

18:20.036 --> 18:22.468
- Hey, Abby.
- Hi, Eric.

18:22.492 --> 18:24.822
Hey, is Leon in a bad mood?

18:26.334 --> 18:28.101
Uh, well, he wasn't,
but he might be now.

18:28.125 --> 18:32.043
Well, sometimes he grinds his teeth.
Like, if you listen, you can hear it.

18:34.509 --> 18:37.320
Yeah, so the crime scene photos
are on their way.

18:37.344 --> 18:41.438
So, what are the pertinent
and juicy details?

18:41.462 --> 18:44.108
A woman, lamp,
a lot of blood spatter.

18:44.132 --> 18:45.318
Bedroom?

18:45.342 --> 18:47.014
Living room and hallway.

18:47.772 --> 18:49.492
Well,
I guess you can't have everything.

18:49.516 --> 18:52.703
All right, I will call you
as soon as I find something.

18:52.727 --> 18:54.123
Cool. See you, Abby.

18:54.147 --> 18:57.155
One day, Eric. One day.

19:00.076 --> 19:01.760
Oh, God.

19:01.784 --> 19:03.744
Whoo.

19:05.415 --> 19:07.430
What are we chasing now?

19:07.454 --> 19:10.092
Trying to get a clearer image
of the car the killer drove

19:10.116 --> 19:11.599
from the marina parking lot.

19:11.623 --> 19:15.770
So I'm searching hard drives
of nearby traffic cameras.

19:15.794 --> 19:17.603
We get her car,
we get her licence plate.

19:17.627 --> 19:20.945
We get her licence plate, we might be
able to figure out where she's staying.

19:20.969 --> 19:23.546
- Keep at it.
- You got it, Leon.

19:24.100 --> 19:25.891
Director.

19:34.068 --> 19:35.159
Frank Davis with DARPA.

19:35.183 --> 19:37.579
- Are we being recorded?
- Would you like to be?

19:37.603 --> 19:39.251
Absolutely not.

19:39.275 --> 19:40.611
Are we?

19:41.117 --> 19:42.148
No.

19:42.660 --> 19:45.210
This is your safe house.
I just figured it was wired.

19:45.234 --> 19:47.655
You don't want us to share?
Is that it, Frank?

19:48.541 --> 19:51.661
This is a classified briefing.
It doesn't leave the room.

19:53.129 --> 19:54.327
Shoot.

19:55.048 --> 19:57.016
Daniel Su was very secretive.

19:57.040 --> 19:59.102
We put it down to the fact
that he had grown up

19:59.126 --> 20:00.938
in what is virtually a police state,

20:00.962 --> 20:04.173
where sharing information with
someone could put their life at risk.

20:05.016 --> 20:07.068
As a result,
there were certain key aspects

20:07.092 --> 20:10.909
to the technology he was developing
that only he knew about.

20:10.933 --> 20:12.648
He didn't share with you?

20:13.358 --> 20:14.603
No.

20:15.109 --> 20:17.078
Now that's embarrassing.

20:17.102 --> 20:20.481
I mean, I can see how you wouldn't
want this to leave the room, Frank.

20:22.617 --> 20:24.585
Of course, under the terms
of the DARPA contract,

20:24.609 --> 20:26.719
that was all about to change.

20:26.743 --> 20:28.704
Did Sally Morris know?

20:29.207 --> 20:31.092
She told me she didn't.

20:31.116 --> 20:33.806
She was a financier.
A business woman.

20:33.830 --> 20:35.888
I have no reason to disbelieve her.

20:35.912 --> 20:38.022
Maybe he told his brother,
Jimmy Su.

20:38.046 --> 20:39.437
They defected together.

20:39.461 --> 20:42.445
Jimmy married a U.S. Citizen.
He runs an importing company.

20:42.469 --> 20:44.771
He's not a scientist,
didn't go to college.

20:44.795 --> 20:46.965
He says his brother
didn't tell him anything.

20:47.475 --> 20:50.725
Daniel Su's technology
died with him.

20:51.437 --> 20:54.224
Only problem
is Kai doesn't know that.

20:54.774 --> 20:57.751
And she's gonna go after anyone
associated with Daniel Su.

20:57.775 --> 21:02.712
- Why don't I trust that guy?
- He's a bureaucrat. It stands to reason.

21:02.736 --> 21:05.291
- You hate all bureaucrats.
- I do?

21:05.315 --> 21:08.007
Yeah. All those foster homes
when you were a kid.

21:08.031 --> 21:12.498
The way that people used to push you
around, tell you where to go, what to do.

21:12.917 --> 21:14.435
You been talking to Nate
or something?

21:14.459 --> 21:17.628
- Oh, no. This is my theory.
- Uh-huh.

21:18.005 --> 21:20.519
Dr. Hannah, M.D. Nice.

21:20.543 --> 21:22.508
This is it.

21:24.512 --> 21:26.552
Right here.

21:28.766 --> 21:30.153
Yeah.

21:30.177 --> 21:32.510
Director Vance, it's Callen.

21:33.563 --> 21:36.824
- The director is coming online now.
- Vance.

21:36.848 --> 21:40.500
Yeah, our DARPA guy thinks Danny
Su took his technology to the grave.

21:40.524 --> 21:41.869
No one else knows.

21:41.893 --> 21:44.455
- He's certain?
- Yeah.

21:44.479 --> 21:46.068
Do you believe him?

21:46.951 --> 21:48.635
He's a bureaucrat.

21:48.659 --> 21:51.948
Sam thinks that I have
a deep-seated suspicion of them.

21:53.207 --> 21:55.935
I'm a bureaucrat, Agent Callen.

21:55.959 --> 21:59.803
I don't have a deep-seated suspicion
of you, uh, Director.

21:59.827 --> 22:02.769
Well,
I'm pleased to hear that's the case.

22:02.793 --> 22:04.817
I think we should talk to Jimmy Su.

22:04.841 --> 22:06.564
- G, that's his wife.
- Jimmy.

22:06.588 --> 22:08.281
- Wait.
- Don't argue with me.

22:08.305 --> 22:10.904
- That's him.
- You need to listen...

22:10.928 --> 22:12.903
We got Su on the ground.
We'll call you back.

22:12.927 --> 22:15.178
Callen? Ca...?

22:16.272 --> 22:17.956
Daniel is dead.

22:17.980 --> 22:21.541
Jimmy, they want you.
Come back inside, please, Jimmy.

22:21.565 --> 22:23.503
Why? What? I will never...

22:23.527 --> 22:25.736
Gun! Roof of the mall!

22:26.866 --> 22:28.325
Get down!

22:34.373 --> 22:36.971
You wanna peek your head
over there and take a look?

22:36.995 --> 22:38.413
I'm good.

23:00.448 --> 23:01.882
- Hey, Sam.
- Yeah.

23:01.906 --> 23:03.426
They just arrived.

23:03.450 --> 23:05.195
Thanks.

23:06.662 --> 23:08.014
Are they okay, G?

23:08.038 --> 23:09.664
Yeah.

23:10.374 --> 23:11.548
Anything?

23:11.572 --> 23:13.102
Nothing.

23:13.126 --> 23:15.536
She even took her shell casings.

23:27.183 --> 23:29.068
Did your brother say
what he was working on?

23:29.092 --> 23:31.118
No, Daniel did not share things.

23:31.142 --> 23:33.767
Everything was kept a secret.

23:37.735 --> 23:39.692
My country has come for me.

23:41.238 --> 23:43.088
Her name is Lee Wuan Kai.

23:43.112 --> 23:45.322
She's North Korean.

23:49.038 --> 23:50.698
So what happens now?

23:51.499 --> 23:53.372
We're trying to neutralise the threat.

23:54.877 --> 23:58.293
And if that doesn't work?

23:58.798 --> 24:02.665
What if this... This woman gets away?

24:03.803 --> 24:05.926
Well, the government
will offer you protection.

24:07.056 --> 24:09.179
They have programmes. Uh...

24:09.809 --> 24:12.157
You might have to consider
relocation,

24:12.181 --> 24:14.310
a new identity.

24:21.320 --> 24:23.360
Daniel loved America.

24:25.658 --> 24:27.673
He said that one day
of happiness here

24:27.697 --> 24:31.035
was worth a hundred days of sadness
in our home country.

24:33.416 --> 24:35.492
I will not relocate.

24:36.085 --> 24:38.410
And I will not change my name.

24:39.338 --> 24:40.369
Do you understand?

24:42.883 --> 24:44.710
We get it.

24:48.139 --> 24:49.906
I found Kai.

24:49.930 --> 24:52.744
Traffic cam on the freeway onramp
recorded her seven minutes

24:52.768 --> 24:55.153
after the shooting. She headed east.

24:55.177 --> 24:57.679
There is a nice, bright
screen grab of her licence plate.

24:58.190 --> 25:00.836
Now,
check it against hotel registrations.

25:00.860 --> 25:02.580
It's already up and running.

25:02.604 --> 25:03.869
And we have a winner.

25:03.893 --> 25:06.717
W.H. Hotel, West Hollywood,
Room 1805.

25:06.741 --> 25:08.865
Registered as a Kim Andrews.

25:09.076 --> 25:11.863
Tell Callen to meet me there.

25:12.913 --> 25:15.463
- Callen.
- W.H. Hotel, 57809,

25:15.487 --> 25:18.477
Roberts Boulevard, West Hollywood.

25:18.501 --> 25:20.709
- Lobby.
- Thanks, Eric.

25:22.214 --> 25:25.548
You'll be safe here.
We'll talk some more.

25:26.051 --> 25:27.546
Sam.

25:28.304 --> 25:30.462
Kens, we're leaving.

25:36.061 --> 25:37.069
- They find her?
- Mm-hm.

25:37.093 --> 25:39.596
Hotel. West Hollywood.

25:43.068 --> 25:44.563
What?

25:44.987 --> 25:47.750
They're going all
married couple on us.

25:47.774 --> 25:49.146
They're kissing?

25:50.075 --> 25:51.783
Fighting, Nate.

25:56.373 --> 25:57.725
You're reading?

25:57.749 --> 25:59.874
Trying to, without staring.

26:08.093 --> 26:09.480
And there's the catch right there.

26:09.504 --> 26:14.387
In order to lip read, you need to stare,
which is far too obvious.

26:21.690 --> 26:23.185
Better?

26:29.156 --> 26:30.615
Oh, she's not happy.

26:34.620 --> 26:37.467
He said, "Don't tell."

26:37.491 --> 26:38.863
- Don't tell?
- Shut up.

26:44.129 --> 26:46.122
He's saying that...

26:50.844 --> 26:53.738
What? What did he say?
Did you get it?

26:53.762 --> 26:55.105
Yeah, I got it.

26:55.129 --> 26:56.742
What's he keeping from us?

26:56.766 --> 26:59.318
He knows his brother's business.

26:59.342 --> 27:00.848
All of it.

27:02.856 --> 27:04.243
Callen.

27:04.267 --> 27:06.244
Manager says Kai's not here.

27:06.268 --> 27:07.795
I'm gonna look in her room.

27:07.819 --> 27:10.880
All right. We just pulled up to the valet.
We'll be there in one minute.

27:10.904 --> 27:13.315
Cover the foyer.

27:15.035 --> 27:16.589
You got it.

27:16.613 --> 27:19.195
You're right. It is personal.

28:05.419 --> 28:06.675
You flatter me.

28:06.699 --> 28:10.711
The head of a federal agency
personally searching my room.

28:13.218 --> 28:14.761
After all these years.

28:16.472 --> 28:19.449
- Yeah?
- We finally get to speak.

28:19.473 --> 28:22.477
Are you calling to give yourself up,
Kai?

28:24.897 --> 28:28.039
Eric, trace the calls
coming into Room 1805.

28:28.063 --> 28:29.977
It's Kai.

28:30.778 --> 28:32.912
All right, it's a cell phone
in the building.

28:32.936 --> 28:34.963
Getting the GPS signal.

28:34.987 --> 28:37.826
Looks like the seventh floor,
south corridor.

28:39.161 --> 28:41.403
You never give up, do you, Leon?

28:42.247 --> 28:44.655
Turn left, now.

28:45.417 --> 28:47.873
Tell me I didn't pass you
in the foyer.

28:48.921 --> 28:50.806
No, but close.

28:50.830 --> 28:54.102
You haven't changed much
since New York City, Leon.

28:54.126 --> 28:56.294
If you move to your right...

28:57.012 --> 28:58.732
Thirty yards and closing.

28:58.756 --> 29:01.742
Tell me,
are you calling for a reason, Kai?

29:01.766 --> 29:03.476
Or just to catch up?

29:03.977 --> 29:05.863
There's something I need to tell you.

29:05.887 --> 29:07.438
What do you need to tell me?

29:08.982 --> 29:10.785
Eric, you're breaking up.
How close?

29:10.809 --> 29:12.585
Leon...

29:12.609 --> 29:14.296
Thirty yards and closing.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.148
You're almost on her.

29:30.337 --> 29:31.712
I know you can hear me.

29:33.132 --> 29:34.674
Kai.

29:35.175 --> 29:36.480
Kai?

29:36.504 --> 29:37.981
Kai, are you still there?

29:38.005 --> 29:39.483
She's gone.

29:39.507 --> 29:41.055
Why did she call?

29:41.598 --> 29:44.350
To tell us she didn't kill Sally Morris.

29:55.961 --> 29:59.389
It's not the first time a bad guy
made a call to the investigating officer.

29:59.413 --> 30:01.973
The question is, do we believe her?

30:01.997 --> 30:03.694
Director,

30:03.718 --> 30:05.878
I think I've found something.

30:08.182 --> 30:10.993
I ran a programme
on Daniel Su's security system.

30:11.017 --> 30:12.952
It was a sophisticated system,

30:12.976 --> 30:16.739
with motion sensors tracking
every corner of the house.

30:16.763 --> 30:20.748
Now, 30 minutes
leading up to her death,

30:20.772 --> 30:24.372
there was someone else in the office
with her.

30:24.396 --> 30:27.752
I mean, the red and the blue spans,
that indicates movement.

30:27.776 --> 30:29.801
So two people.

30:29.825 --> 30:31.822
So things get a little crazy

30:33.374 --> 30:35.722
as the intruder chases her
around the house.

30:35.746 --> 30:37.293
And then,

30:38.796 --> 30:40.396
the intruder wins.

30:40.420 --> 30:42.143
Which means she knew her killer.

30:42.167 --> 30:43.811
Let him in through the front door.

30:43.835 --> 30:46.796
Eric, phone logs
for Daniel Su's home office.

30:48.347 --> 30:51.158
Highlight calls by frequency
over the past 24 hours.

30:51.182 --> 30:52.429
Callen.

30:54.812 --> 30:56.389
Okay.

30:57.314 --> 30:59.366
Three numbers all linked.

30:59.390 --> 31:01.998
The primary number
is the home office.

31:02.022 --> 31:04.922
More calls went back and forth
between it and the two other numbers

31:04.946 --> 31:06.798
more frequently than any others.

31:06.822 --> 31:08.626
The most frequent calls
were made between

31:08.650 --> 31:10.510
the two other numbers to each other.

31:10.534 --> 31:12.920
They have names, Eric.

31:12.944 --> 31:14.367
Right.

31:20.003 --> 31:22.850
Our friendly bureaucrat and the
victim's brother have been real chatty

31:22.874 --> 31:24.353
over the last four days.

31:24.377 --> 31:27.195
- Planning something maybe.
- Thanks, Nate.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.354
Jimmy Su knows more
about his brother's technology

31:29.378 --> 31:31.025
than he's letting on.

31:31.049 --> 31:33.108
Kensi read him talking to his wife.

31:33.132 --> 31:36.285
So after his brother's death,
he went to visit the business partner.

31:36.309 --> 31:39.574
They had an argument over
who owns the technology.

31:39.598 --> 31:42.240
Argument gets heated, he kills her.

31:42.264 --> 31:44.210
And Kai gets the blame.

31:44.234 --> 31:46.585
We need him
to admit his involvement.

31:46.609 --> 31:49.817
That's gonna require putting somebody
undercover that hasn't met Jimmy Su.

32:03.672 --> 32:05.795
Not bad.

32:06.508 --> 32:10.506
The trousers are a little snug,
so don't plan to run anywhere.

32:11.096 --> 32:12.235
Earpiece.

32:12.259 --> 32:16.559
Put it in deep,
we'll worry about digging it out later.

32:20.022 --> 32:23.082
The, uh, button on your left pocket
is a camera.

32:23.106 --> 32:25.813
The button on your right pocket
is a microphone.

32:27.654 --> 32:29.279
And the duress word is?

32:31.984 --> 32:35.753
He who hesitates is lost, Dominic.

32:35.777 --> 32:39.097
In your line of work, dead.

32:39.121 --> 32:41.058
Uh, shadows.

32:41.082 --> 32:42.971
And with the utterance
of that single word,

32:42.995 --> 32:46.705
the cavalry will race to the rescue.

32:47.507 --> 32:50.259
Let's hope they don't get caught
in traffic.

32:53.597 --> 32:55.008
Sign.

32:57.226 --> 33:01.437
The uniform is new,
so try not to get any blood on it.

33:03.440 --> 33:05.516
He's all yours.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.778
Make the call.

33:10.781 --> 33:14.042
Dom, you're gonna be fine.

33:14.066 --> 33:16.282
Sam and I will have your back.

33:21.959 --> 33:25.434
Picture is up.
Jimmy Su has left the safe house.

33:25.458 --> 33:27.847
She's still out there.

33:27.871 --> 33:29.423
Yes, she is.

33:57.661 --> 33:58.941
That's him.

34:01.123 --> 34:02.914
Here we go.

34:09.214 --> 34:10.388
Okay, what do you want?

34:10.411 --> 34:12.358
Like I said on the phone,

34:12.382 --> 34:15.397
I was the first unit to get
to your brother's house this morning.

34:15.420 --> 34:16.851
I found the woman on the floor.

34:16.876 --> 34:19.522
She whispered a name to me
before she died.

34:19.545 --> 34:23.342
I thought you might like to buy
that information from me.

34:24.521 --> 34:25.576
Whose name?

34:25.600 --> 34:26.887
Yours.

34:31.902 --> 34:33.896
You guys, we got a problem.

34:34.531 --> 34:36.333
I attached an alert
to Jimmy Su's cell phone

34:36.358 --> 34:39.925
so we'd know if someone was trying to
trace his location. It just got tripped.

34:39.949 --> 34:42.848
Someone else is out there.
There's a strong signal strength.

34:42.871 --> 34:45.139
Abort the mission.
There's an imminent threat.

34:45.163 --> 34:47.053
You don't know
what you're talking about.

34:47.077 --> 34:48.581
Get him the hell out of there.

34:52.549 --> 34:54.043
Cover me.

34:55.010 --> 34:56.634
Stay down!

35:18.492 --> 35:20.425
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

35:20.449 --> 35:21.650
Get behind the car!

36:26.309 --> 36:28.800
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

36:47.747 --> 36:49.325
Do you believe him?

36:49.624 --> 36:52.578
All right,
sign him into L.A.P.D. Custody.

36:55.297 --> 36:57.669
Jimmy Su denies killing anyone.

36:59.593 --> 37:02.048
You're wondering
if I set him out as bait.

37:05.515 --> 37:07.555
He was well covered.

37:08.602 --> 37:09.882
Yes, he was.

37:14.774 --> 37:16.909
- Miss Sciuto.
- Hey, Leon.

37:16.933 --> 37:19.494
Cool spatter. But it's not all spatter.

37:19.518 --> 37:23.041
There's some smears
and some drag marks.

37:23.065 --> 37:24.593
A little bit of pooling.

37:24.617 --> 37:26.587
Anything revealing, Miss Sciuto?

37:26.611 --> 37:28.779
The lamp. The lamp was revealing.

37:29.289 --> 37:32.872
16.99, from Wal-Mart,
made in China.

37:33.376 --> 37:36.306
Not much of a lamp,
but a pretty efficient bludgeon.

37:36.330 --> 37:38.105
- Miss Sciuto?
- There's one more thing.

37:38.129 --> 37:42.272
There's no prints.
Lots of smears, but there's this...

37:42.296 --> 37:44.568
This outliney thingy.

37:44.592 --> 37:47.194
- A what?
- It's a partial outline

37:47.218 --> 37:48.695
of the killer's hand.

37:48.719 --> 37:52.866
Like I said, it's too smeared
to get prints off of, but there's a mark.

37:52.890 --> 37:56.704
It's like the blood flowed over
and around the fingers.

37:56.728 --> 38:00.079
There's two marks, actually.
And they're really close together.

38:00.103 --> 38:02.485
What do you think
made these marks?

38:04.074 --> 38:05.947
Yes, she is.

38:06.785 --> 38:08.362
I will.

38:14.584 --> 38:16.541
How long have you been married?

38:17.170 --> 38:18.748
Three years.

38:21.341 --> 38:23.689
Our forensics lab found
a bloody handprint on the lamp

38:23.713 --> 38:25.296
used to kill Sally.

38:27.639 --> 38:30.047
Our killer wore two rings.

38:31.476 --> 38:35.059
Left hand, ring finger.

38:37.816 --> 38:40.188
Sally knew her killer, Aimee.

38:43.571 --> 38:48.209
She let her in through the front door.
She stayed half an hour?

38:48.233 --> 38:50.735
No. Uh...

38:55.792 --> 38:57.915
You wanna tell me
how it happened?

39:01.923 --> 39:04.248
Jimmy was the smart one,

39:04.509 --> 39:06.228
not Daniel.

39:06.252 --> 39:07.483
Only the three of us knew.

39:07.507 --> 39:11.522
Frank suspected he was signing
a deal with the wrong brother.

39:11.546 --> 39:13.492
He was making a lot of phone calls
to Jimmy.

39:13.516 --> 39:14.883
He wanted to know the truth.

39:15.687 --> 39:18.450
Uh, Jimmy doesn't care about
the money.

39:18.474 --> 39:22.373
He just...
He just wanted to help his brother.

39:22.397 --> 39:28.903
And then I was with Sally this morning
when she got the call about Daniel.

39:29.576 --> 39:30.927
I told her the truth.

39:30.951 --> 39:34.464
She was furious because
Daniel and Jimmy had lied to her.

39:34.488 --> 39:39.635
She was saying that she would
have Jimmy locked up and sent back.

39:39.659 --> 39:41.390
She was shouting at me.

39:41.414 --> 39:44.814
She was shouting at me
and so the lamp was there.

39:44.838 --> 39:47.131
I just picked it up, l...

39:49.596 --> 39:51.885
And afterwards, you told Jimmy.

39:56.311 --> 39:59.929
They... They're not gonna
send him back, are they?

40:01.107 --> 40:02.107
No.

40:03.276 --> 40:05.269
No, they're not gonna
send him back.

40:13.912 --> 40:15.821
It's Vance.

40:21.920 --> 40:22.951
Director.

40:24.214 --> 40:25.648
Director.

40:25.672 --> 40:27.394
She bailed at the top of the ramp.

40:27.418 --> 40:30.130
Half a dozen exits
she could have used.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.896
She lost a lot of blood.

40:44.651 --> 40:48.695
If she doesn't turn up at a hospital
by tonight, she's dead.

40:52.242 --> 40:53.819
Hmm. Agent Vail,

40:54.661 --> 40:56.131
that's good work.

40:56.155 --> 40:57.610
Oh, thank you, Director.

41:00.708 --> 41:02.286
Gentlemen.

41:05.964 --> 41:08.087
You know he doesn't believe it
for a second.

41:09.092 --> 41:12.104
He's never gonna
stop looking for her.

41:12.128 --> 41:15.115
Even if he drives a stake
through her heart and buries her,

41:15.139 --> 41:17.820
he's still gonna wake up
in the middle of the night,

41:17.844 --> 41:20.282
wondering if she's
hiding under his bed.

41:20.306 --> 41:25.555
It's just irrational fear does
strange things to people, you know?

41:27.902 --> 41:30.572
Oh, shoot. Uh, guys?

41:31.406 --> 41:32.710
I think I lost a button.

41:32.734 --> 41:35.125
- You lost a button?
- The camera button.

41:35.149 --> 41:38.742
You lost Hetty's camera button?

41:44.878 --> 41:46.312
Where did you lose it?

41:46.336 --> 41:48.307
If I knew, then it wouldn't be lost.

41:48.331 --> 41:51.269
- It's gotta be around here somewhere.
- You gotta find that button.

41:51.293 --> 41:53.235
How could you lose
Hetty's camera button?

41:53.259 --> 41:56.179
- Just look under there.
- Okay, okay.

41:57.379 --> 41:58.379
Oh, no.

41:59.976 --> 42:01.387
Hetty's gonna kill me.
