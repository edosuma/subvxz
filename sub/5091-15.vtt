WEBVTT

00:08.163 --> 00:09.580
A turtle.

00:09.581 --> 00:11.582
A turtle's taking a walk
in Central Park... Oh.

00:11.583 --> 00:13.066
Yeah. late one night.
Uh-huh.

00:13.067 --> 00:15.703
And he gets mugged
by a gang of snails.

00:15.704 --> 00:17.088
Uh-oh.
Now...

00:17.089 --> 00:20.074
the investigating detective
asks the turtle,

00:20.075 --> 00:22.793
"What-what can you recall?"
And the turtle thinks,

00:22.794 --> 00:24.912
looks confused,
and he says,

00:24.913 --> 00:28.215
"I don't know.
It happened so fast."

00:29.451 --> 00:32.153
Y-you know,
Walter,

00:32.154 --> 00:34.422
it's great that
your jokes are always clean.

00:34.423 --> 00:36.490
Be nice if they were funny, too.

00:36.491 --> 00:37.775
What is not funny about that?

00:37.776 --> 00:39.160
Everything.
I'd say the set up,

00:39.161 --> 00:41.262
the punch line, the delivery:
the whole thing.

00:42.564 --> 00:44.115
Walt.
It's a turtle!

00:44.116 --> 00:47.118
Give it up, Walter.
Was everything satisfactory, gentlemen?

00:47.119 --> 00:48.936
Toughest piece of meat
I ever had, Karl.

00:48.937 --> 00:51.205
What did you do,
run over it on the way to work?

00:51.206 --> 00:52.706
I'm sorry

00:52.707 --> 00:54.492
it was not to your liking,
Commissioner.

00:54.493 --> 00:56.343
Uh, may I offer
another round

00:56.344 --> 00:57.945
of Appletinis on the house?

00:57.946 --> 00:59.213
Oh, thank you, Karl.

00:59.214 --> 01:01.115
We'll tip the full five percent.

01:01.116 --> 01:02.683
Wait a minute, Frank.
What are you doing, huh? No, I got it.

01:02.684 --> 01:04.468
No, I got this, all right?
Frank!

01:04.468 --> 01:06.286
Hold on a second.
Um... Thank you.

01:06.287 --> 01:07.488
Um...

01:07.489 --> 01:09.507
The atrium

01:09.508 --> 01:11.225
at John Jay College is, uh...

01:11.226 --> 01:12.927
being dedicated

01:12.928 --> 01:15.162
to the memory of my son.
Oh...

01:17.432 --> 01:19.767
It's a pretty big deal.

01:19.768 --> 01:21.602
The ceremony's Thursday.

01:21.603 --> 01:24.505
Oh, I-I wouldn't
miss it, Frank.

01:24.506 --> 01:27.191
I'll be there, absolutely.
Sure.

01:27.192 --> 01:28.642
Done.

01:28.643 --> 01:30.194
Thank you.

01:36.785 --> 01:38.986
I need a little time.

01:40.155 --> 01:42.957
Life is good, Walter.

01:42.958 --> 01:44.491
Where did you get these?

01:44.492 --> 01:45.526
Don't ask.

10-13! 10-13!

02:03.612 --> 02:05.312
Corner of Beaver and Williams,
in Manhattan.

02:05.313 --> 02:06.313
I repeat, 10-13!

02:06.314 --> 02:07.815
This is Car One.

02:07.816 --> 02:09.984
It's Reagan.
The PC's been shot.

02:13.905 --> 02:15.890
<i>In a word: lucky.</i>

02:15.891 --> 02:18.909
He took some shot
to his left arm and chest

02:18.910 --> 02:21.045
that impacted the artery
but missed the heart.

02:21.046 --> 02:22.529
Is he talking?
Is he sedated?

02:22.530 --> 02:24.197
Oh, yeah, he's talking.
He's already trying

02:24.198 --> 02:25.299
to talk his way out of here.

02:25.300 --> 02:26.500
How long before
he gets to go home?

02:26.501 --> 02:28.535
Uh, we'll hold him
for two days, minimum.

02:28.536 --> 02:30.170
I want to keep him
under observation

02:30.171 --> 02:31.755
to make sure there's no
pulmonary involvement.

02:31.756 --> 02:33.908
But he's going to be okay.

02:33.909 --> 02:36.727
He's in remarkably great shape.
And, as I said, very lucky.

02:36.728 --> 02:37.811
Here we are.

02:37.812 --> 02:39.346
Okay.
Go ahead, Grandpa.

02:40.482 --> 02:42.616
Hi, Dad.

02:42.617 --> 02:45.319
Hey.

02:48.690 --> 02:50.774
I'm going to be fine. Promise.

02:50.775 --> 02:51.759
You're looking at

02:51.760 --> 02:53.794
one grateful
bunch, Francis.

02:53.795 --> 02:56.630
What can you
tell us, Dad?

02:56.631 --> 02:58.933
They ruined my best blazer.

03:00.335 --> 03:01.569
About the shooter.

03:01.570 --> 03:05.606
I know, Danny.

03:08.476 --> 03:10.878
I don't know much.

03:13.582 --> 03:15.816
Dark sedan.

03:15.817 --> 03:18.519
I'm sure my guys
got the make.

03:18.520 --> 03:22.089
Shotgun, obviously.

03:22.958 --> 03:25.225
This one was a flyer.

03:27.762 --> 03:29.964
Most likely a sawed-off shotgun

03:29.965 --> 03:32.266
because, uh...

03:32.267 --> 03:34.168
a blast came
from inside the car.

03:35.971 --> 03:39.206
I didn't see the shooter.

03:39.207 --> 03:42.176
Think for a second, Dad.

03:42.177 --> 03:44.912
I am thinking, son.

03:44.913 --> 03:47.448
Dad, was he
white, black,

03:47.449 --> 03:49.216
clean-shaven, beard?

03:49.217 --> 03:50.751
Can you remember anything?

03:50.752 --> 03:52.786
What happened to Walter?

03:52.787 --> 03:54.555
He's fine.

03:54.556 --> 03:55.856
A sprained wrist
from breaking his fall.

03:55.857 --> 03:57.324
Good.

03:57.325 --> 04:01.962
I just wouldn't forgive myself
if anything happened to Walter.

04:01.963 --> 04:03.597
Maybe, Doctor,

04:03.598 --> 04:05.816
you could, uh...

04:05.817 --> 04:07.735
check on Walter.

04:07.736 --> 04:09.820
Dad, can you just try
to remember anything...

04:09.821 --> 04:11.238
He's still
in some shock.

04:11.239 --> 04:12.339
Commissioner,

04:12.340 --> 04:14.341
I'm going to take your
family downstairs

04:14.342 --> 04:15.776
to get some of our
wretched coffee

04:15.777 --> 04:17.778
and then we'll check back
with you in a little while.

04:19.113 --> 04:21.315
We'll be right outside, okay?

04:29.991 --> 04:31.358
Reagan.

04:32.827 --> 04:34.828
Yeah?

04:34.829 --> 04:36.096
No. No, no, no. You wait.

04:36.097 --> 04:37.665
I'm coming down.

04:37.666 --> 04:40.067
Yeah.

04:50.011 --> 04:52.479
These guys are toast.

Okay, listen up!

05:27.160 --> 05:31.196
Intel's flagging the Reynaldo
cartel in central Mexico,

05:31.197 --> 05:33.865
for the attempt on the life
of Commissioner Reagan.

05:33.866 --> 05:35.467
One of their bigs

05:35.468 --> 05:37.953
is coming to trial here
in a couple of weeks,

05:37.954 --> 05:39.604
and they've got a long history

05:39.605 --> 05:41.339
of revenge killings
in their own country

05:41.340 --> 05:44.426
in response to police actions
taken against them.

05:44.427 --> 05:47.345
Now, whether that means
they're exporting their methods

05:47.346 --> 05:49.181
as well as their materials,

05:49.182 --> 05:51.383
that's the question. So...

05:51.384 --> 05:52.884
Narcotics,

05:52.885 --> 05:55.353
Gang Unit, JTTF--

05:55.354 --> 05:57.089
that's the top of your pile.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.123
Sorry.

05:58.124 --> 05:59.124
Detective Reagan.

05:59.125 --> 06:00.392
How's the Commissioner?

06:00.393 --> 06:01.860
Um... he's good.

06:01.861 --> 06:03.728
He-he took some shot
to the arm and chest

06:03.729 --> 06:05.697
but he's-he's out
of the woods now.

06:05.698 --> 06:07.466
That's great to hear.
I interviewed him briefly.

06:07.467 --> 06:08.950
He wasn't 100%,

06:08.951 --> 06:10.435
but by tomorrow morning,
he should be fine.

06:10.436 --> 06:11.736
I'll get a statement...
Thank you, Detective.

06:11.737 --> 06:13.572
The thoughts and prayers
of every man and woman

06:13.573 --> 06:16.341
in this department
are with you and your family.

06:21.013 --> 06:22.114
Ho. Hey.

06:22.115 --> 06:24.349
They located the car,
in, uh, Greenpoint.

06:24.350 --> 06:25.950
Hold on,
I'll check it.

06:25.951 --> 06:27.002
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

06:27.003 --> 06:28.753
Excuse me. Sorry.
Excuse me.

06:28.754 --> 06:30.555
They found the car where?
Commissioner?

06:30.556 --> 06:31.756
What is it, Detective?
Sir.

06:31.757 --> 06:34.309
I want in.

06:34.310 --> 06:35.811
Your father's in the hospital.

06:35.812 --> 06:36.928
That's where
you're needed the most.

06:36.929 --> 06:38.697
I'm a detective;
I'm not a doctor.

06:38.698 --> 06:39.898
I think I could do
some good here.

06:39.899 --> 06:41.933
I don't have a spot
for you right now,

06:41.934 --> 06:43.135
or the time to discuss one.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.302
Does this have something to do

06:44.303 --> 06:45.837
with some kind of beef
between you and my dad?

06:45.838 --> 06:48.440
I didn't hear
what you just said.

06:49.275 --> 06:51.243
Okay, look,

06:51.244 --> 06:52.511
I just want to help.

06:52.512 --> 06:53.645
Okay? Please.

06:53.646 --> 06:56.081
It's covered.

07:02.655 --> 07:05.540
<i>How's he doing?</i>

07:05.541 --> 07:07.492
Well, we're hoping
he's getting some sleep.

07:07.493 --> 07:08.493
Thanks, hon.

07:08.494 --> 07:09.528
What's going on
out there?

07:09.529 --> 07:11.012
Well, they found
the shooter car

07:11.013 --> 07:13.231
over in Greenpoint, but nobody's
claimed responsibility yet.

07:13.232 --> 07:14.966
Intel's looking at some, uh,

07:14.967 --> 07:16.801
Mexican cartel
that's got

07:16.802 --> 07:18.520
a habit of taking out
public officials

07:18.521 --> 07:20.222
when one of their own
gets pinched.

07:20.223 --> 07:21.072
The Reynaldos?

07:21.073 --> 07:23.241
Yeah.
Special Prosecutor

07:23.242 --> 07:24.309
on that is a friend of mine.

07:24.310 --> 07:25.544
I'll lean on him in the morning.

07:25.545 --> 07:26.945
Good.
Look,

07:26.946 --> 07:28.530
I know this is your father,

07:28.531 --> 07:32.184
but take care not to overstep
your boundaries here.

07:32.185 --> 07:34.019
I don't even know
what the boundaries are

07:34.020 --> 07:35.487
in a situation like this.

07:35.488 --> 07:36.922
I'm just saying...

07:36.923 --> 07:39.090
It's Erin, Grandpa. She wrote
the book on "by the book."

07:40.359 --> 07:42.928
I just supposed to
cruise the beat

07:42.929 --> 07:46.047
and hope somebody calls 911
with a guilty conscience?

07:46.048 --> 07:47.699
Is what it is, kid.
Get used to it.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.334
Vincenzo squeezed
me out, too.

07:49.335 --> 07:52.437
And I bet he'll have his feet up
on Frank's desk by the morning.

07:52.438 --> 07:54.072
Yeah, well,
I got Jackie trying to find

07:54.073 --> 07:55.840
a way in,
so maybe we'll get lucky.

07:55.841 --> 07:57.809
You need to
watch yourself.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.678
I will.

07:59.679 --> 08:02.180
Our place is right here tonight.

08:02.181 --> 08:04.950
Oh-ho!

08:04.951 --> 08:07.085
Hmm.
Bless you.

08:07.086 --> 08:09.421
Bless you.
Figured you'd like that.

08:09.422 --> 08:11.089
Ah. Any takers?

08:11.090 --> 08:13.091
Oh, yeah.

08:13.092 --> 08:14.292
Good.

08:14.293 --> 08:16.428
I'll have some of that.

08:16.429 --> 08:18.597
Yeah.

08:18.598 --> 08:20.498
Yeah.

08:24.503 --> 08:26.972
To dodging bullets.

08:26.973 --> 08:28.239
Hear, hear.
Hear, hear.

08:28.240 --> 08:30.875
Hear, hear.
To dodging bullets.

08:31.744 --> 08:33.477
Whoa!

08:33.479 --> 08:34.346
Whoa!

08:34.347 --> 08:35.513
Pops,

08:35.514 --> 08:36.581
you brought a gun?

08:36.582 --> 08:38.683
Yeah.
Talk about boundaries.

08:38.683 --> 08:40.018
It's a hospital.

08:40.019 --> 08:42.053
And somebody tried
to take my son's life tonight.

08:42.054 --> 08:44.689
And I don't know
who or where he is.

08:46.025 --> 08:48.360
We're gonna let him sleep
till 6:00 or so.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.562
I suggest you all go home
and do the same.

08:53.432 --> 08:54.899
We're good here.

09:00.306 --> 09:02.674
Thanks for everything, Doc.

09:34.907 --> 09:36.608
Hey.

09:36.609 --> 09:37.909
You're kidding me.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.661
All right, great.

09:39.662 --> 09:41.479
Yeah, I'll meet you outside.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.048
They got a name, Grandpa.

09:43.049 --> 09:44.332
Talk to you later.

09:44.333 --> 09:46.551
Go get 'em.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.655
The shooter's
car is an '02 Nissan.

09:50.656 --> 09:52.507
There's no plates,
and the VIN number

09:52.508 --> 09:54.959
was ground off the engine
block and the frame.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.160
Is that it?

09:56.161 --> 09:58.129
No. The techs found a
check-cashing receipt

09:58.130 --> 09:59.531
in the car.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.132
Is it dated?
Yeah, day before last.

10:01.133 --> 10:02.600
Great.
How'd you get us in?

10:02.601 --> 10:03.802
Wasn't easy.

10:03.803 --> 10:05.637
It's like there's
one case in this city,

10:05.638 --> 10:07.038
and every
detective is on it.

10:07.039 --> 10:09.557
But it happens to be in
Sunset Park, in Little Mexico,

10:09.558 --> 10:11.976
and I do speak Spanish.
Good job, partner.

10:17.316 --> 10:19.751
You could march
elephants past her,

10:19.752 --> 10:22.087
and she wouldn't
look up from the TV.

10:22.088 --> 10:24.906
Hey, didn't you say
the, uh, VIN numbers

10:24.907 --> 10:27.158
were rubbed off on the shooter car?
Yeah.

10:27.159 --> 10:29.060
If I'm gonna steal a car
and dump it, I probably

10:29.061 --> 10:31.029
wouldn't take the time to rub
off the VIN numbers, right?

10:31.030 --> 10:33.581
On the other hand,
if I got it from a chop shop

10:33.582 --> 10:35.600
across the street
from where I cash my checks,

10:35.601 --> 10:39.070
VIN number probably rubbed off
already, don't you think?

10:39.071 --> 10:40.705
Yeah.

10:40.706 --> 10:42.073
Let's go take a look.

10:43.209 --> 10:45.009
<i>Jamie, the, uh...</i>

10:45.010 --> 10:47.912
the unit protecting your dad
has been fully deployed.

10:47.913 --> 10:49.230
Best of the best.

10:49.231 --> 10:51.399
So you're saying that...
I'm saying is,

10:51.400 --> 10:54.886
would you want a rookie beat cop
on that assignment?

10:54.887 --> 10:58.323
Think before you answer.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.775
I wouldn't be doing
either of us a favor

11:00.776 --> 11:02.026
by taking this upstairs

11:02.027 --> 11:04.228
and putting you
where you don't belong.

11:08.250 --> 11:09.667
I got it.

11:09.668 --> 11:12.237
Hey... I'm on the job
a lot longer than you.

11:12.238 --> 11:15.106
I outrank you,
yet here I am,

11:15.107 --> 11:18.610
rolling with you,
same tour, same beat.

11:18.611 --> 11:20.795
How you think
that makes me feel?

11:20.796 --> 11:22.547
It's not your father
that got shot, Sarge.

11:22.548 --> 11:23.748
No, it's not.

11:23.749 --> 11:25.683
But here's the thing:
It's a chance

11:25.684 --> 11:27.652
to be at the right place
at the right time,

11:27.653 --> 11:29.654
and that gets me
excited every day.

11:29.655 --> 11:32.056
That's what happens out here.

11:32.057 --> 11:33.658
Understand, kid?

11:33.659 --> 11:36.227
Yeah.

11:36.228 --> 11:39.263
<i>Hey, numb nuts.
Look, I'm just trying</i>

11:39.264 --> 11:40.532
to help you find
out who stole

11:40.533 --> 11:41.833
your stolen '02 Nissan.

11:41.834 --> 11:44.469
Same car that was used to shoot
the police commissioner.

11:44.470 --> 11:45.670
You understand what I'm saying?

11:47.673 --> 11:49.073
Okay.

11:49.074 --> 11:51.442
Well, I'm pretty sure that
car came from this chop shop,

11:51.443 --> 11:53.111
so maybe you shot
the commissioner.

11:53.112 --> 11:55.246
The car was gone when
I opened up yesterday.

11:55.247 --> 11:57.749
But I don't know who
took it, I swear to you.

11:57.750 --> 11:58.750
Who's your buyer?

11:58.751 --> 12:00.952
Who's your supplier?!

12:02.588 --> 12:03.755
He doesn't want to talk.

12:03.756 --> 12:05.423
You don't want to talk, huh?

12:05.424 --> 12:07.625
How about... how about
we chop up your chop shop?

12:07.626 --> 12:09.928
Hey, <i>vámonos.</i>
They don't have names.

12:09.929 --> 12:11.830
What? What?!

12:11.831 --> 12:15.066
El gringo loco.
<i>Darme lo.</i>

12:15.067 --> 12:18.303
Los Niños del Diablo.

12:18.304 --> 12:21.239
The crew that
rules around here.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.641
Listen, I'm going
to call Gang Unit

12:23.642 --> 12:27.812
and see if they do
any errands for the Reynaldos.

12:33.285 --> 12:34.452
Stay put.

12:34.453 --> 12:35.453
Jackie, keep an eye on him.

12:35.454 --> 12:37.705
Yeah.

12:44.013 --> 12:45.263
Hey!

12:45.264 --> 12:46.865
Hey! Reagan!
I got him!

12:46.866 --> 12:48.800
Stay with him!
Okay.

13:00.246 --> 13:01.646
Come here.

13:03.566 --> 13:06.251
Come here. Come here.

13:07.570 --> 13:10.121
Track star, huh?

13:11.457 --> 13:13.541
Come on.

13:13.542 --> 13:14.893
Come on!

13:29.975 --> 13:31.676
Welcome home, Francis.

13:31.677 --> 13:33.778
Looks like May Day
in Moscow out there.

13:33.779 --> 13:36.714
Ordered directly by the Mayor's
Office, believe it or not.

13:36.715 --> 13:38.049
What's all this?

13:38.050 --> 13:40.985
Well, we got pastrami
from the Carnegie.

13:40.986 --> 13:42.887
We got cheesecake
from Junior's.

13:42.888 --> 13:45.023
We got salamis
from Faicco's.

13:45.024 --> 13:46.824
You name it, we got it.

13:46.825 --> 13:49.694
Half the restaurants in New York
City trying to kill me, too?

13:49.695 --> 13:52.497
Stuff's been pouring
in since dawn.

13:52.498 --> 13:53.248
Welcome home, sir.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.432
Baker.

13:54.433 --> 13:56.935
Sir...
Don't even start, Baker.

13:56.936 --> 13:59.604
It wasn't the detail's fault.

14:00.873 --> 14:02.206
What about intel?

14:02.207 --> 14:04.108
The city's been
turned inside out,

14:04.109 --> 14:05.310
but nothing solid yet.

14:05.311 --> 14:07.745
Okay. You can go
back to the office.

14:07.746 --> 14:10.114
This is our temporary
headquarters, sir.

14:15.721 --> 14:16.721
We thought this would
be easier for you.

14:16.722 --> 14:19.023
All right.
As you were.

14:19.024 --> 14:20.775
What else you got for me?

14:20.776 --> 14:22.026
Check-ins from
the White House,

14:22.027 --> 14:23.361
both Senators,
the governor.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.929
List goes on. We can start
rolling the returns

14:24.930 --> 14:25.997
soon as you're up to it.

14:25.998 --> 14:28.066
I can handle phone calls.

14:28.067 --> 14:30.201
And we should schedule
a statement to the press,

14:30.202 --> 14:31.268
get me out front.

14:31.269 --> 14:32.437
Already in the
works, sir.

14:32.438 --> 14:34.372
And it would probably
be a good idea

14:34.373 --> 14:35.807
to reschedule
any public appearances

14:35.808 --> 14:37.342
until the situation
is resolved.

14:37.343 --> 14:40.078
You're talking
about Joe's dedication.

14:40.079 --> 14:41.796
Yes, sir.

14:42.631 --> 14:44.716
I'm going.

14:45.818 --> 14:48.553
Let's call the White House back.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.388
Not every day you
get to do that.

14:55.761 --> 14:57.228
<i>Come on.</i>

14:57.229 --> 14:59.097
So you sold him the car, but
you didn't tell your boss?

14:59.098 --> 15:00.798
Yes, Detective Reagan, yes.

15:00.799 --> 15:02.233
But, you know, I
don't know his name.

15:02.234 --> 15:03.651
Like, he was, like, a friend
of a friend of an uncle,

15:03.652 --> 15:05.069
and he gave me, like,
$400. I-I don't know.

15:05.070 --> 15:06.104
Yeah, and what's he look like?

15:06.105 --> 15:07.772
He's Mexican,
you know?

15:07.773 --> 15:09.907
He's regular height.
He's got, like,

15:09.908 --> 15:10.992
a round face
like a football.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.243
Hey, Chico... Chico!

15:12.244 --> 15:13.478
You're describing
half of Sunset Park

15:13.479 --> 15:14.545
to me, all right?

15:14.546 --> 15:16.313
Tell me
what the guy was wearing.

15:18.317 --> 15:19.851
Tell me what he was wearing!

15:19.852 --> 15:22.353
He-He had on a-a Knicks jacket.

15:22.354 --> 15:24.088
You know?
But I mean, come on.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.124
He's probably changed
by now. You know?

15:26.125 --> 15:27.558
Where'd he contact you?

15:27.559 --> 15:29.493
I don't know.
What do you mean?

15:29.494 --> 15:30.595
Where he
contacted me...

15:30.596 --> 15:32.830
On my... on my
cell phone.

15:32.831 --> 15:34.065
Where's your phone?

15:34.066 --> 15:37.035
It's in my jacket.

15:37.036 --> 15:39.470
Mr. Popularity
has 13 missed calls.

15:40.689 --> 15:42.339
When's the last time
you spoke to your guy, huh?

15:42.340 --> 15:44.175
I gave him a call,

15:44.176 --> 15:46.343
uh, right when you guys
came into the shop,

15:46.344 --> 15:48.146
you know? And,
uh, he asked me

15:48.147 --> 15:49.680
to listen in on you

15:49.681 --> 15:51.482
and, uh, and
then, you saw me.

15:51.483 --> 15:52.483
This the number?

15:52.484 --> 15:54.369
I couldn't
really s... uh...

15:54.370 --> 15:55.737
Is that the number?

15:55.738 --> 15:58.206
Yeah. That's the number.

15:58.207 --> 15:59.690
Jackie, do me a favor.

15:59.691 --> 16:01.209
Run this number for me.

16:16.208 --> 16:17.542
Look at that.

16:17.543 --> 16:18.976
It's your guy.

16:18.977 --> 16:20.711
Um...

16:20.712 --> 16:21.846
You know what?

16:21.847 --> 16:23.114
I think you're gonna
answer the phone

16:23.115 --> 16:24.082
and talk to him.

16:24.083 --> 16:25.433
Um, Detective Reagan,
this is...

16:25.434 --> 16:26.734
No, no. You're gonna
answer the phone,

16:26.735 --> 16:28.436
and you're gonna talk
to him right now.

16:28.437 --> 16:29.821
I wouldn't...
I think you're gonna

16:29.822 --> 16:30.905
answer the phone

16:30.906 --> 16:32.256
and you're gonna speak
to him right now,

16:32.257 --> 16:34.058
or I'm gonna rip
your freakin' head off.

16:34.059 --> 16:36.027
Yeah... Yes.
Yeah. All right.

16:36.028 --> 16:37.862
Detective, you got it.
Okay? You got it.

16:37.863 --> 16:39.030
Good. All right.
So, yeah.

16:39.031 --> 16:40.164
All right. It's not a problem.
Good.

16:40.165 --> 16:41.499
Tell him you can't speak now.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.917
You got to go meet him
somewhere. You understand me?

16:42.918 --> 16:45.403
Yes, sir. Yes...

16:45.404 --> 16:47.371
Answer the phone
and don't do nothing funny.

16:47.372 --> 16:49.574
Yo.

16:54.546 --> 16:57.515
Yeah... Um...

16:57.516 --> 16:59.517
He says
that he went by the shop,

16:59.518 --> 17:02.487
and, uh, he knows
that I'm here with you guys.

17:02.488 --> 17:05.623
He, uh, he wants
to talk to you.

17:05.624 --> 17:06.858
Me?

17:06.858 --> 17:09.093
That's what he said.
I don't know.

17:11.195 --> 17:12.896
This is Detective Reagan.

17:14.532 --> 17:16.451
Hello? You there?

17:16.452 --> 17:18.319
Hello?

17:18.319 --> 17:20.404
Hello? You there?

17:20.405 --> 17:22.073
Yeah, man. Listen to me, man.

17:22.074 --> 17:23.324
I was driving the car, okay?

17:23.325 --> 17:25.460
But I didn't know
it was the commissioner, okay?

17:25.461 --> 17:26.661
You got to believe me, man.

17:26.662 --> 17:27.678
He said he just wanted to scare

17:27.679 --> 17:29.247
some guy who owed him, okay?

17:29.248 --> 17:31.115
No way I would've driven it,
man,

17:31.116 --> 17:32.884
if I thought
the commissioner was there.

17:35.637 --> 17:37.288
This guy says he's the driver.

17:37.289 --> 17:38.956
Lock him up.

17:38.957 --> 17:40.641
All right, what's your name?

17:40.642 --> 17:41.826
No, no, no, no, man.

17:41.827 --> 17:44.479
Slow down.
Nothing yet.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.730
I'm gonna need some assurances.

17:45.731 --> 17:46.731
Like what?

17:46.732 --> 17:47.849
Like the whole New York police

17:47.850 --> 17:49.133
is looking for me, right?

17:49.134 --> 17:50.935
Hey, come on! Hurry it up!

17:50.936 --> 17:52.904
I don't want to die for this,
man, you know?

17:52.905 --> 17:54.172
Okay. So you come on in,

17:54.173 --> 17:55.823
and I'll take care
of everything.

17:55.824 --> 17:58.910
I give you this guy,
what are you gonna give me?

17:58.911 --> 18:01.145
See if you can get
my sister down here.

18:01.146 --> 18:02.246
Tell me what you want.

18:02.247 --> 18:03.681
What do they call it, man?

18:03.682 --> 18:05.850
You don't get charged?
Immunity.

18:05.851 --> 18:07.051
That's what I want.

18:07.052 --> 18:09.353
No. We don't negotiate
over the phone here.

18:09.354 --> 18:10.988
So here's what you're gonna do.

18:10.989 --> 18:13.291
You're gonna wait for me
to come pick you up.

18:13.292 --> 18:15.326
And you're gonna trust me.
And I'm gonna take care

18:15.327 --> 18:16.360
of this, all right?

18:16.361 --> 18:17.628
You! In there!

18:17.629 --> 18:18.763
Let me in!
Hold on!

18:18.764 --> 18:20.398
No, no. I'm not gonna hold on.

18:20.399 --> 18:22.133
Hey!

18:22.134 --> 18:23.167
I got to call you back.

18:23.168 --> 18:24.268
What? No, no, no!

18:24.269 --> 18:26.037
You stay on the phone!

18:26.038 --> 18:28.272
Hello?! Hello?!

18:39.303 --> 18:40.853
I scheduled a stand-up
for the press

18:40.854 --> 18:42.455
out front at 10:00
tomorrow morning.

18:42.456 --> 18:44.473
Do you want me to
write up a draft?

18:44.474 --> 18:46.025
No, just make sure
we have the names

18:46.026 --> 18:48.361
of the doctors and nurses
I want to thank.

18:48.362 --> 18:49.795
Do you want
Vincenzo there?

18:51.932 --> 18:53.132
Just me.

18:53.133 --> 18:55.701
They're calling him Al Haig
down at headquarters.

18:55.702 --> 18:57.403
Well, there were a lot
of disappointed people

18:57.404 --> 18:59.305
when the mayor chose me
over him.

18:59.306 --> 19:02.208
Why did you pick your rival
to be your second-in-command?

19:02.209 --> 19:05.161
He was the best man for the job.

19:05.162 --> 19:08.814
Just in case it isn't
those banditos...

19:08.815 --> 19:10.349
Pop, what's that?

19:10.350 --> 19:13.886
Press clippings
from your rookie year on up.

19:13.887 --> 19:16.689
That's 34 years
of making enemies--

19:16.690 --> 19:19.041
you had some
pretty bad actors.

19:19.042 --> 19:21.927
I just thought we might like
to take a trip

19:21.928 --> 19:23.229
down Memory Lane and, uh,

19:23.230 --> 19:24.797
see if anything rings a bell.

19:25.766 --> 19:27.800
<i>Okay, but just suppose</i>

19:27.801 --> 19:28.901
he's telling the truth.

19:28.902 --> 19:30.036
That's a big if.

19:30.037 --> 19:32.337
Go with me,
all right?

19:32.338 --> 19:33.939
He comes in, he
gives up the shooter.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.408
What could we offer that
we can make good on?

19:35.409 --> 19:37.526
Without talking to my boss?

19:37.527 --> 19:39.011
Leniency.

19:39.012 --> 19:41.747
If his testimony
results in a conviction.

19:45.118 --> 19:46.719
No conviction, no deal?

19:46.720 --> 19:49.989
We need a little
quiet in here.

19:49.990 --> 19:53.042
Yeah?

19:53.043 --> 19:55.795
It's-It's Danny, all
right? Call me Danny.

19:55.796 --> 19:58.531
Why you want to help me?
You don't even know me.

19:58.532 --> 19:59.632
Because you're trying

19:59.633 --> 20:00.966
to do the right
thing here, okay?

20:00.967 --> 20:02.301
And you're a guy who's
trying to be smart.

20:02.302 --> 20:03.302
And I admire that.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.504
Can you bring me in safe?

20:05.505 --> 20:07.073
I'll come get you
myself right now,

20:07.074 --> 20:08.140
if you tell me
where you are.

20:08.141 --> 20:09.541
What about a reward?

20:09.542 --> 20:11.310
It says on the news
there's a reward.

20:12.913 --> 20:15.548
You come in right now,

20:15.549 --> 20:17.400
I'll look into it, all right?

20:17.401 --> 20:19.051
Maybe I'll even
throw in a couple

20:19.052 --> 20:21.654
of Knicks courtside
seats for you.

20:21.655 --> 20:23.055
But you've got to
come in right now.

20:23.056 --> 20:24.657
Why should I trust you?

20:24.658 --> 20:26.625
Listen.

20:26.626 --> 20:30.162
Every cop in the city is out
there looking for you, okay?

20:30.163 --> 20:32.231
You do not want them to
get to you before I do.

20:32.232 --> 20:33.733
Now, just tell me...

20:33.734 --> 20:35.768
tell me your name, at least.

20:35.769 --> 20:37.970
It's Diego.

20:37.971 --> 20:41.440
Okay. Diego. Good.

20:41.441 --> 20:42.708
If you want me to help you,

20:42.709 --> 20:45.544
you got to tell me
where I can find you.

20:48.298 --> 20:50.883
I'm at Casa Florinda.

20:50.884 --> 20:52.184
31st and Ninth.

20:52.185 --> 20:53.719
Okay. Casa Florinda.

20:53.720 --> 20:54.653
31st and Ninth.

20:54.654 --> 20:55.855
Okay. I'm on my way.

20:55.856 --> 20:57.273
Do not move.

20:57.274 --> 20:58.691
Can you wait for me an hour,
to get back?

20:58.692 --> 21:01.260
Yeah. All right.
Call your boss.

21:18.078 --> 21:19.912
Rory?

21:23.350 --> 21:25.301
What you doing here, man?

21:25.302 --> 21:26.719
Something the matter?

21:26.720 --> 21:28.754
No, nothing.

21:28.755 --> 21:30.923
Then why you looking
everywhere but in my eyes?

21:30.924 --> 21:34.193
I'm just surprised, man.

21:41.184 --> 21:43.602
You're this wasted, buddy?
It's not even 5:00.

21:47.774 --> 21:48.774
Hey. Your friend okay?

21:48.775 --> 21:52.011
I'll take care of him.

21:55.315 --> 21:57.500
Sleep it off.

22:03.056 --> 22:05.791
♪ Why ♪

22:05.792 --> 22:09.494
♪ She does me wrong ♪

22:09.495 --> 22:14.166

22:14.167 --> 22:15.968
Who sings that?

22:16.837 --> 22:19.238
It's The Red Hot Sushi.

22:19.239 --> 22:21.841
Let's keep it that way.

22:21.842 --> 22:23.309
You don't like my singing, huh?

22:24.277 --> 22:26.145
It's not that bad.

22:26.146 --> 22:28.180
12-Sergeant on the air.

22:28.181 --> 22:29.715
Yeah, 12-Sergeant.

22:29.716 --> 22:30.716
Go ahead.

22:30.717 --> 22:32.785
Anonymous call, 10-24,

22:32.786 --> 22:35.221
reported stabbing,
Casa Florinda, 31st and Ninth.

22:35.222 --> 22:38.374
12-Sergeant, copy that.

22:38.375 --> 22:39.825
Okay, let's go.

22:44.297 --> 22:45.397
Hey.

22:45.398 --> 22:46.549
Is he alive?

22:46.550 --> 22:47.499
No. You caught this?

22:47.500 --> 22:49.301
Ah, we were coming
to scoop him up.

22:49.302 --> 22:50.669
According to him,
he was the driver

22:50.670 --> 22:52.204
in the attempt on
Dad last night.

22:52.205 --> 22:53.222
This was the guy?

22:53.223 --> 22:54.306
That's what he said.

22:54.307 --> 22:55.758
You guys checked
his I.D., right?

22:55.759 --> 22:56.742
His name's Diego?

22:56.743 --> 22:58.010
Yeah, Diego, yeah.

22:58.011 --> 22:58.978
Damn it.

22:58.979 --> 23:00.279
I got a cell phone here.

23:00.280 --> 23:02.014
Somebody want
to bag it?

23:02.949 --> 23:04.383
Yeah, we'll take that.

23:04.384 --> 23:06.185
Hey, hold on.

23:06.186 --> 23:08.220
We're gonna have to get
an emergency drop on that phone.

23:08.221 --> 23:09.755
The shooter's number
is probably in there.

23:09.756 --> 23:11.257
How do you know whose it is?
Hold on.

23:12.292 --> 23:14.927
The phone's ringing.

23:14.928 --> 23:17.529
It's his;
I just dialed it.

23:24.404 --> 23:26.288
<i>Can't eat another bite.</i>

23:26.289 --> 23:27.306
<i>Henry,</i>

23:27.307 --> 23:29.308
what do we have
for dessert?

23:29.309 --> 23:30.609
Don't we have
more important things

23:30.610 --> 23:32.011
to think about
right now?

23:32.012 --> 23:34.213
Pop, there's 35,000
of New York's finest

23:34.214 --> 23:35.814
out looking
for whoever did this.

23:35.815 --> 23:37.433
I don't think we're going
to beat 'em to it

23:37.434 --> 23:38.784
by going through this stuff.

23:38.785 --> 23:40.753
Well, but...
Hey.

23:40.754 --> 23:41.987
Hey, Monsignor.

23:41.988 --> 23:43.389
Uh, Dad,

23:43.390 --> 23:45.557
the name Rory Brennan--
does it ring any bells?

23:48.428 --> 23:50.629
Blast from the past.

23:51.498 --> 23:53.465
Maybe you did call it, Pop.

23:59.897 --> 24:01.563
Rory's father,
Whitey Brennan,

24:01.641 --> 24:02.858
was head of
the Westies gang

24:02.859 --> 24:04.143
back in the '70s.

24:04.144 --> 24:06.512
He ran gambling, loan-sharking,
and union shakedowns

24:06.513 --> 24:07.613
out of Hell's
Kitchen.

24:07.614 --> 24:08.847
He was finally indicted
on two murders,

24:08.848 --> 24:10.983
but then he went underground,

24:10.984 --> 24:12.317
and then we got a tip

24:12.318 --> 24:15.287
that he was going to attend
the baptism of his grandson

24:15.288 --> 24:17.322
at a church out in Woodside,
where his daughter lived.

24:17.323 --> 24:20.793
Whitey had built
them a new rectory

24:20.794 --> 24:23.429
and he bought a silver
tabernacle for the church,

24:23.430 --> 24:26.198
so the pastor
returned a favor and

24:26.199 --> 24:28.667
held the ceremony at night
and kept his mouth shut.

24:28.668 --> 24:29.935
I led the operation.

24:29.936 --> 24:31.703
It was supposed to be
pretty straightforward--

24:31.704 --> 24:34.673
surround the church and arrest
Whitey when he came out.

24:34.674 --> 24:36.742
Every Westie there had a gun.

24:36.743 --> 24:39.912
Somebody gave a shout,
all hell broke loose.

24:39.913 --> 24:43.115
Two were wounded on our side,
and four of his were killed...

24:44.017 --> 24:46.051
...including
his wife

24:46.052 --> 24:48.520
and infant grandson.

24:54.527 --> 24:56.595
It was the
only time your father

24:56.596 --> 24:58.864
asked me
for a professional favor.

24:58.865 --> 25:01.733
Well, you mind if I ask
what that favor was?

25:01.734 --> 25:03.001
There was a movement
for commendations

25:03.002 --> 25:05.337
for the men involved.

25:05.338 --> 25:07.372
Your dad asked me to squash it.

25:07.373 --> 25:08.757
Two innocents died.

25:08.758 --> 25:12.044
Wasn't our fault, but it was
hardly our finest hour.

25:12.045 --> 25:13.078
What's the connection

25:13.079 --> 25:14.880
to Rory Brennan?

25:14.881 --> 25:17.182
Well, the driver--
this Diego guy--

25:17.183 --> 25:19.685
he spoke to Rory five times
on the day of the shooting--

25:19.686 --> 25:22.855
three times in the hour before,
two times in the hour after.

25:22.856 --> 25:24.289
They in business together?

25:24.290 --> 25:26.692
They were in
prison together, up in Fishkill.

25:26.693 --> 25:29.394
It's been Rory's home away from
home since he was 18 years old.

25:29.395 --> 25:31.196
Excuse me.

25:31.197 --> 25:32.531
Reagan.

25:32.532 --> 25:34.082
Yep.

25:34.083 --> 25:36.118
All right, I'm on my way.

25:36.119 --> 25:37.202
Whitey's other kid Kevin.

25:37.203 --> 25:38.904
He owns a bar
up in Washington Heights.

25:38.905 --> 25:41.507
They're giving it a toss,
so I got to get up there.

25:41.508 --> 25:44.376
All right, I'll see you guys.

25:44.377 --> 25:46.244
Dad, you didn't happen
to speak

25:46.245 --> 25:48.647
to Vincenzo on my behalf,
did you?

25:48.648 --> 25:51.583
Never have,
never would.

25:51.584 --> 25:53.085
We'll get this guy.

25:53.086 --> 25:54.119
Well, be careful.

25:54.120 --> 25:55.587
If he's anything
like his old man...

25:55.588 --> 25:57.890
Hey, if I'm anything
like my old man,

25:57.891 --> 26:00.275
he's the one that
better be careful.

26:00.276 --> 26:01.293
Feel better.

26:01.294 --> 26:03.462
See you.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.903
Help yourselves
to the whiskey,

26:10.904 --> 26:15.941
but, uh, leave the
cash, okay, guy?

26:15.942 --> 26:17.292
Hurt your knee?

26:17.293 --> 26:20.312
My hip needs replacing.

26:20.313 --> 26:22.447
You said Reagan, right?

26:22.448 --> 26:24.049
Yeah.
Any relation

26:24.050 --> 26:25.617
to the commissioner?

26:25.618 --> 26:27.386
He's my father.

26:27.387 --> 26:29.955
Sorry for your troubles.

26:29.956 --> 26:32.791
Well, let's talk
about your troubles, okay?

26:32.792 --> 26:36.094
Detective Reagan, I haven't
had a run-in with the law

26:36.095 --> 26:39.831
since a D&D when
I was all of 17.

26:39.832 --> 26:41.900
Actually, you were 18.

26:44.170 --> 26:45.671
The good son, huh?

26:45.672 --> 26:48.006
There's one in
every Irish family.

26:48.007 --> 26:49.408
True.

26:49.409 --> 26:52.211
The point is,
I don't have troubles.

26:52.212 --> 26:54.379
You know how I
managed that?

26:54.380 --> 26:56.982
By staying a million miles
away from my brother Rory.

26:56.983 --> 27:01.253
And for the millionth time,
I don't know where he is.

27:01.254 --> 27:03.488
Well, maybe
your old man does.

27:05.024 --> 27:06.758
So I need to know
where he is then.

27:06.759 --> 27:09.895
Look, he's an old man
dying a painful death.

27:09.896 --> 27:11.964
Who also pulled
a compassionate release

27:11.965 --> 27:13.732
from Allenwood
three weeks ago.

27:13.733 --> 27:16.018
We haven't heard
from his parole officer,

27:16.019 --> 27:17.703
so I need to speak
to him now.

27:17.704 --> 27:20.672
You know the history
between our fathers, right?

27:20.673 --> 27:23.075
Of course.

27:23.076 --> 27:25.344
Don't you think
mine's paid enough?

27:28.915 --> 27:30.582
I got to find
your brother Kevin.

27:30.583 --> 27:32.417
There's a city
full of cops

27:32.418 --> 27:35.020
who will roust your old man
like a teenage douche,

27:35.021 --> 27:37.222
if they get to him
before I do.

27:38.758 --> 27:41.260
You want to let
that happen to him?

27:52.221 --> 27:54.339
<i>Yeah, I saw that on the news.</i>

27:54.340 --> 27:55.941
Made my week.

27:55.942 --> 27:57.943
Yeah, your son's a lousy shot;
that made my week.

27:57.944 --> 27:59.177
You've got nothing
on my son

27:59.178 --> 28:01.213
or you wouldn't be sniffing
around a sick old man,

28:01.214 --> 28:02.648
so you get lost.
I have enough

28:02.649 --> 28:04.816
to drag your ass down
to the precinct for questioning

28:04.817 --> 28:06.418
as to his whereabouts.

28:06.419 --> 28:07.719
You feel like
taking a ride, Grandpa?

28:07.720 --> 28:09.221
What, are you kidding me?

28:11.057 --> 28:12.958
Jackie, why don't you see
if they got a wheelchair

28:12.959 --> 28:15.694
and a fresh pair of panties
for Mr. Brennan here, please?

28:15.695 --> 28:17.896
Yeah, right away.

28:28.908 --> 28:31.076
Play games with me, old man?

28:31.077 --> 28:33.245
Hmm?

28:33.246 --> 28:35.263
I know Rory comes
to see you here.

28:35.264 --> 28:38.133
So why don't you just tell me
where Rory goes after he leaves?

28:38.134 --> 28:40.319
How the hell
should I know?

28:40.320 --> 28:42.988
Sure you want
to play games, huh?

28:45.858 --> 28:47.893
W-What are you doing?

28:47.894 --> 28:49.861
This a morphine drip?
No, no,

28:49.862 --> 28:51.596
don't you touch that.
Hey...

28:51.597 --> 28:53.432
Where's Rory?

28:53.433 --> 28:54.533
Nurse!

28:55.501 --> 28:56.818
Where's Rory, old man?

28:56.819 --> 28:57.903
Nurse!

28:57.904 --> 28:59.955
Somebody! Please!

28:59.956 --> 29:02.407
Sweet dreams.

29:02.408 --> 29:03.742
Nurse!

29:03.743 --> 29:04.943
Somebody!

29:04.944 --> 29:06.345
Okay, guy
matching

29:06.346 --> 29:08.113
Rory's description
just registered

29:08.114 --> 29:11.116
at a motel down by La Guardia.

29:20.760 --> 29:23.895
I see where your son
gets his aim from.

29:46.753 --> 29:46.785
Drop it!
Oh!

29:48.321 --> 29:49.588
Hey, drop the gun!

29:49.589 --> 29:51.322
Get back!
Drop it!

29:51.323 --> 29:52.624
Get back!

29:52.625 --> 29:53.959
Police!
Drop your gun!

29:58.898 --> 30:00.265
I got him.
Brennan shot her.

30:00.266 --> 30:01.266
Stay down.

30:01.267 --> 30:02.884
We need a doctor!

30:05.271 --> 30:06.688
Hold it, Rory!

30:12.344 --> 30:13.845
Drop it!

30:29.429 --> 30:31.496
Reagan!

30:31.497 --> 30:33.265
It's okay!

30:33.266 --> 30:34.533
Calling it in!

30:34.534 --> 30:35.867
Okay!

31:26.812 --> 31:28.213
Francis!

31:28.214 --> 31:30.782
Coming.

31:30.783 --> 31:31.916
Can I ask you
something?

31:31.917 --> 31:33.651
May I...

31:33.652 --> 31:35.487
When Grandpa arrested
Mr. Brennan

31:35.488 --> 31:37.388
after the baptism,

31:37.389 --> 31:39.858
Mom said a couple
of his family were killed.

31:41.026 --> 31:42.110
But was the baby okay?

31:42.111 --> 31:44.529
Yeah, the baby was fine.

31:44.530 --> 31:45.730
Francis, time.

31:45.731 --> 31:48.733
The baby wasn't
okay, was he?

31:48.734 --> 31:50.101
Why would you say that?

31:50.102 --> 31:53.638
You always said,
"Good cops make lousy liars."

31:53.639 --> 31:57.775
That's not
for your little cousins to know.

31:57.776 --> 31:59.477
Understood?

31:59.478 --> 32:00.678
We're good.

32:00.679 --> 32:02.981
Hey.

32:02.982 --> 32:04.649
There's my grandsons.
Grandpa.

32:04.650 --> 32:05.633
Grandpa.

32:05.634 --> 32:08.052
Oh.
Oh, easy.

32:08.053 --> 32:09.504
Hey.
Hey, sweetheart.

32:09.505 --> 32:10.755
Danny in the car?

32:10.756 --> 32:12.857
No, he's checking on the
nurse who was wounded.

32:12.858 --> 32:15.143
He's meeting us there.

32:15.144 --> 32:16.828
Come on, guys,
let's go.

32:16.829 --> 32:18.346
Where's your sling?

32:18.347 --> 32:20.148
On my dresser.

32:20.149 --> 32:21.933
That's not what I meant.

32:21.934 --> 32:24.736
Dr. Keller said
ten days minimum.

32:24.737 --> 32:26.371
Well, Dr. Keller
isn't going to be there,

32:26.372 --> 32:29.040
and you're not going to rat
on your old man, are you?

32:30.142 --> 32:32.777
Let's go.
Looking good, Pop.

32:32.778 --> 32:34.679
Thanks.

32:35.447 --> 32:37.815
You're going to
do fine, Dad.

32:45.424 --> 32:46.624
Easter?

32:46.625 --> 32:48.259
Easter, can you wake up?

32:48.260 --> 32:50.194
Detective Reagan,
remember?

32:50.195 --> 32:52.664
From last night,
when Rory Brennan shot you?

32:52.665 --> 32:55.700
I need to ask you a few questions
about Rory Brennan, okay?

32:55.701 --> 32:58.870
Yes. Why were
you after him?

32:58.871 --> 33:02.507
Well, we think Rory tried
to kill the police commissioner.

33:02.508 --> 33:04.475
I just wanted
to come by

33:04.476 --> 33:06.811
and just make sure
I didn't miss anything.

33:06.812 --> 33:08.947
We watched that
on the news.

33:08.948 --> 33:11.416
Yeah. Yeah, it was on the news.

33:11.417 --> 33:14.185
We watched it on
the news together.

33:14.186 --> 33:16.654
What do you mean, "we"?

33:16.655 --> 33:18.523
Rory Brennan and I.

33:18.524 --> 33:20.858
His father was having
a really bad day.

33:20.859 --> 33:24.162
They thought it might
be the end, so...

33:24.163 --> 33:27.432
he was there from late afternoon
until early next morning.

33:27.433 --> 33:30.201
You saw Rory Brennan
the whole night?

33:30.202 --> 33:32.770
I was on duty
on the floor.

33:32.771 --> 33:34.739
He was either
in the room

33:34.740 --> 33:37.108
or in the hall,
talking on the phone.

33:37.109 --> 33:40.645
He didn't leave until his brother
came, early next morning.

33:42.348 --> 33:44.682
Wait, his brother Kevin?
Yes.

33:44.683 --> 33:46.985
Kevin...

33:46.986 --> 33:48.720
They fought something terrible.

33:48.721 --> 33:50.755
You could hear them
all down the floor.

33:50.756 --> 33:52.240
Well, what were
they fighting about?

33:52.241 --> 33:53.458
Could you hear them?

33:53.459 --> 33:57.462
When I went down to hush them...

33:57.463 --> 34:00.031
Rory was cursing Kevin.

34:00.032 --> 34:03.267
What'd he keep shouting?

34:03.268 --> 34:06.304
Their "one chance
to honor their father."

34:11.076 --> 34:13.244
Left you some flowers.

34:20.252 --> 34:21.518
I hope you're almost here.

34:21.520 --> 34:22.719
No, Dad. Listen to me.

34:22.721 --> 34:24.389
Both brothers were
in on it, all right?

34:24.389 --> 34:25.473
And Kevin's still out there.

34:25.474 --> 34:27.291
I think you should hold off
on the ceremony.

34:27.292 --> 34:29.726
Danny, I'm in broad daylight,
surrounded by a sea of blue.

34:29.728 --> 34:30.828
I'm safe.

34:30.829 --> 34:34.114
You just get down here,
for your brother.

34:34.116 --> 34:35.500
The good son?

34:35.501 --> 34:37.869
No such thing in
the Brennan family.

34:38.704 --> 34:40.505
As you were.

34:40.505 --> 34:41.822
<i>On behalf</i>

34:41.824 --> 34:43.641
of the City University
of New York,

34:43.641 --> 34:46.277
the John Jay College
of Criminal Justice,

34:46.277 --> 34:49.480
and the grateful citizens
of this city for whom he made

34:49.481 --> 34:51.799
the ultimate sacrifice,

34:51.800 --> 34:54.351
I am especially pleased that
Joe's family could join us...

34:54.353 --> 34:56.254
Kid, hey, listen to me.
What?

34:56.255 --> 34:57.455
I think the shooter's there.

34:57.456 --> 34:59.257
Where? Here?

34:59.258 --> 35:00.508
There at the ceremony. Yeah.

35:00.509 --> 35:02.860
Listen, Kevin Brennan,
male, white,

35:02.861 --> 35:05.396
six-foot, 170 pounds,
brown hair, kind of long.

35:05.397 --> 35:07.098
Hey, and he walks with a limp.

35:07.099 --> 35:08.232
All right? You got it?

35:08.233 --> 35:09.901
All right,
I'm a few minutes out.

35:09.902 --> 35:13.504
It is my deep
honor to hereby dedicate

35:13.505 --> 35:17.024
this atrium to the memory
of Detective First Grade

35:17.025 --> 35:20.745
Joseph Conor Reagan,

35:20.746 --> 35:23.581
John Jay College, Class of '96.

35:28.253 --> 35:30.588
Kevin Brennan?

35:30.589 --> 35:31.873
No. Sorry.

35:31.874 --> 35:33.958
I-I have to take this.

35:33.959 --> 35:35.960
This is Dr. Barnard.

35:35.961 --> 35:37.428
Okay. How's she doing?

35:37.429 --> 35:39.564
Thank you for coming

35:39.565 --> 35:42.767
to help us honor not just

35:42.768 --> 35:46.170
a brave police officer,
but a cherished son

35:46.171 --> 35:48.456
and grandson;

35:48.457 --> 35:49.874
a wise and generous brother,

35:49.875 --> 35:51.509
a loving uncle,

35:51.510 --> 35:54.345
and to so many of us
in this room,

35:54.346 --> 35:58.682
a loyal and stalwart
comrade in arms.

35:58.683 --> 36:00.902
Joe was something of a...

36:00.903 --> 36:03.221
student of the classics,
not that he'd ever

36:03.222 --> 36:04.455
admit to it.

36:04.456 --> 36:05.790
And I think

36:05.791 --> 36:08.392
<i>that his favorite poem</i>

36:08.393 --> 36:11.579
reflects on the spirit
of service to others

36:11.580 --> 36:13.247
<i>that so...</i>

36:13.248 --> 36:16.367
informed my son's life.

36:17.903 --> 36:19.370
From John Donne:

36:19.371 --> 36:21.255
"No man...

36:21.256 --> 36:23.040
"is an island,

36:23.041 --> 36:25.143
"entire of itself.

36:25.144 --> 36:26.677
"Every man

36:26.678 --> 36:29.447
"is a piece of the Continent,

36:29.448 --> 36:31.549
"part of the Main;

36:31.550 --> 36:34.919
"if a clod be washed away
by the sea,

36:34.920 --> 36:37.488
"Europe is the lesser,

36:37.489 --> 36:40.291
"as well as if
a Promontory were,

36:40.292 --> 36:43.427
"as well as if
a manor of thy friends

36:43.428 --> 36:46.280
"or of thine own were.

36:46.281 --> 36:48.666
"Any man's death

36:48.667 --> 36:50.418
"diminishes me,

36:50.419 --> 36:53.421
"for I am involved in Mankind.

36:53.422 --> 36:55.122
"Therefore...

36:55.123 --> 36:57.091

37:00.779 --> 37:03.681
"Therefore never send to know

37:03.682 --> 37:05.817
"for whom the bell tolls;

37:07.135 --> 37:08.986
...it tolls for thee."

37:08.987 --> 37:10.621
Thank you.

37:14.426 --> 37:16.360
Get the gun.

37:41.136 --> 37:42.220
You okay?
You okay?

37:42.221 --> 37:43.421
Good job.

38:31.103 --> 38:33.738
Hello, Whitey.

38:35.307 --> 38:36.807
Reagan.

38:36.808 --> 38:39.143
I don't know
what you came for,

38:39.144 --> 38:41.312
but I got nothing left.

38:43.949 --> 38:46.918
I came to offer my condolences.

38:48.870 --> 38:53.291
30 years ago, you lost
your wife and a grandson

38:53.292 --> 38:57.228
during an arrest that was
carried out under my command.

38:57.229 --> 39:00.131
There wasn't a time then to...

39:00.132 --> 39:02.600
express regret.

39:06.538 --> 39:09.807
Or if there was,
I didn't take it.

39:10.642 --> 39:14.278
You got some nerve.

39:15.647 --> 39:18.115
I've lost my wife.

39:18.116 --> 39:20.751
I've lost a son.

39:20.752 --> 39:24.422
I have some feeling
for what you went through.

39:26.825 --> 39:29.160
I'm sorry for your loss.

39:29.962 --> 39:32.964
You came all
the way here for that?

39:32.965 --> 39:34.999
I did.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.735
You think
that matters to me?

39:40.238 --> 39:42.273
I hope so.

39:42.274 --> 39:44.775
I know it matters to me.

39:44.776 --> 39:48.646
Okay, you can go now.

39:53.085 --> 39:55.820
Do you want to make
a confession?

39:57.589 --> 40:00.658
Th-Th-That's rich.

40:00.659 --> 40:03.361
Not to me, Whitey.

40:03.362 --> 40:06.464
No? To who?

40:10.969 --> 40:13.971
Monsignor Doonan,
Whitey Brennan.

40:13.972 --> 40:15.940
Good afternoon, Whitey.

40:27.986 --> 40:30.521
Thank you, Monsignor.
