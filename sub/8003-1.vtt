15:03.504 --> 15:04.938
So do I.

Make me proud.

15:06.208 --> 15:07.904
No, no, no, no, no.

15:15.186 --> 15:17.452
He lied to us, Mother.

15:17.524 --> 15:19.686
It's not what you think.

15:19.760 --> 15:21.887
Those are doubloons
for the Addams account.

15:21.962 --> 15:24.363

- There's a fortune.

15:24.432 --> 15:26.459
But nobody can get to it.
I've tried.

15:26.537 --> 15:27.467
Have you?

15:27.536 --> 15:29.802
Have you tried hard enough?

15:29.873 --> 15:31.136
Ask him, sweetheart.

15:31.209 --> 15:33.506
No, no, no, sweetheart.
Don't ask.

45:54.172 --> 45:55.604
- You're unbalanced.
- And I hate him.

45:55.673 --> 45:59.874
By God, you're right!
He is Fester!

45:59.947 --> 46:02.039
Thankyou, Dr. Pinder-Schloss.

46:02.115 --> 46:04.642
I do what I can.

46:04.719 --> 46:07.882
You see, children,
there's lots to learn.

46:11.461 --> 46:12.894
"Gangrene."

46:12.963 --> 46:14.898
Ooh...

46:14.966 --> 46:17.903
Uncle Fester,
how do you know so much?

46:17.971 --> 46:20.404
I've been around.
I pick things up.

46:20.472 --> 46:21.906
In the Bermuda Triangle?

46:23.477 --> 46:26.241
Look, children,
a new chapter.

46:26.314 --> 46:29.149
- "Scabs."
- "Scabs."

46:35.493 --> 46:38.930
Three parts dynamite
with a nitroglycerin cap.

46:38.998 --> 46:41.935
It's perfect for
small holes, carports,

46:42.003 --> 46:43.765
and toolsheds.

46:49.712 --> 46:51.044
Mother.

46:51.114 --> 46:54.608
Everyone will be at the
children's play tonight, correct?

46:54.686 --> 46:57.621
Oh, yes,
I've been working with them.

46:57.689 --> 46:59.248
It's going to be fun.

46:59.325 --> 47:00.190
Fun?

47:00.260 --> 47:04.026
Is that what
we're here for, fun?

47:04.099 --> 47:05.658
Oh, darling, forgive me.

47:05.735 --> 47:07.429
See what they've driven me to?

47:07.502 --> 47:09.437
I've raised a hand to my child,

47:09.505 --> 47:11.030
my reason for living.

47:12.976 --> 47:15.207
You can't go to the play.

47:15.279 --> 47:16.713
But the kids...

47:16.782 --> 47:20.149
The house will be deserted.
The vault will be ours.

47:20.219 --> 47:21.152
But, Mother...

47:21.221 --> 47:23.657
Can you hear it, my treasure?

47:23.725 --> 47:26.660
My heartbeat.
It beats only for you.

47:26.728 --> 47:29.893
Listen closely. It says,
"Gordon, I love you.

47:29.967 --> 47:32.230
Gordon, the vault."

47:32.301 --> 47:35.136
I do hear it.

47:35.206 --> 47:37.141
Soon we'll have the money,

47:37.209 --> 47:39.643
and we'll be far from here.

47:39.712 --> 47:41.305
Loving mother...

47:41.381 --> 47:43.440
grateful son.

47:43.517 --> 47:44.849
Understood?

47:48.525 --> 47:52.963
Ah, there you are, at last.

47:53.030 --> 47:55.965
What a fool I was to doubt you.

47:56.033 --> 47:58.970
Dr. Pinder-Schloss
explained everything.

47:59.038 --> 48:02.064
What a lovely woman. So chilly.

48:02.141 --> 48:05.408
Displacement.
It's a common psychosis.

48:05.480 --> 48:07.414
Isn't that grand?

48:07.482 --> 48:08.414
Is it?

48:08.483 --> 48:10.510
Look at it, Fester.

48:10.587 --> 48:12.419
The primeval ooze--

48:12.490 --> 48:15.288
quicksand, fumes, toxic waste.

48:15.359 --> 48:16.793
It's all ours, Fester.

48:16.862 --> 48:18.796
You belong here, old man.

48:18.864 --> 48:20.422
Stay.

48:20.500 --> 48:22.935
You don't know what you're asking.

48:23.003 --> 48:24.937
You have a beautiful wife,

48:29.011 --> 48:30.911
I'm in the way.

48:30.981 --> 48:35.385
In the way? My brother?

48:35.453 --> 48:37.944
Gomez, take care.

48:39.024 --> 48:41.586
For you,
life is all fun and games.

48:41.662 --> 48:43.959
You dance in a graveyard.

48:44.030 --> 48:45.464
Stench. Decay.

48:45.533 --> 48:46.967
But things change.

48:47.035 --> 48:49.936
Precisely. You're back.

48:50.005 --> 48:53.466
All those years apart, Fester.

48:53.545 --> 48:56.308
We can't do that again.

48:58.551 --> 49:00.986
You're home.

49:40.173 --> 49:41.471
Come on, Uncle Fester.

49:41.542 --> 49:42.975
Come to the play.

49:43.044 --> 49:44.875
I said I was busy.

49:44.946 --> 49:47.382
But you said you'd help us

49:47.450 --> 49:49.883
with the Shakespeare and the pus.

49:49.952 --> 49:52.548
I changed my mind.

50:06.285 --> 50:09.721
Mrs. Addams,
can I see you for a moment?

50:09.788 --> 50:11.222
I'm Susan Firkins.

50:11.291 --> 50:12.724
I'm Wednesday's teacher.

50:12.792 --> 50:14.123
Oh, of course.

50:14.193 --> 50:17.028
Wednesday's told us
so much about you.

50:25.375 --> 50:27.310
Wednesday is
an excellent student,

50:27.378 --> 50:29.814
but, frankly, I'm concerned.

50:29.883 --> 50:32.750
You see, this is
our class bulletin board.

50:32.819 --> 50:34.720
This month our theme
is our heroes--

50:34.789 --> 50:37.257
people we love and admire.

50:37.325 --> 50:40.262
You see, Susan Ringo
has chosen the president.

50:40.330 --> 50:41.923
Isn't that sweet?

50:43.166 --> 50:47.333
And Harmony Feld
has picked Jane Pauley.

50:47.406 --> 50:50.272
Have you spoken to her parents?

50:51.444 --> 50:54.381
But Wednesday
brought in this picture--

50:54.449 --> 50:57.384
Calpurnia Addams.

50:57.452 --> 51:00.082
Wednesday's
Great-aunt Calpurnia.

51:00.156 --> 51:03.057
She was burned
as a witch in 1706.

51:03.126 --> 51:06.563
They say she danced naked
in the town square

51:06.631 --> 51:09.192
and enslaved a minister.

51:09.267 --> 51:10.394
Really?

51:10.470 --> 51:11.733
Oh, yes.

51:11.805 --> 51:13.237
But don't worry.

51:13.306 --> 51:15.070
We've told Wednesday

51:15.142 --> 51:16.735

51:18.280 --> 51:21.215
Isn't he adorable?

51:21.283 --> 51:23.081
I made this myself.

51:23.153 --> 51:24.212
It's charming.

51:24.288 --> 51:26.756
What is he, a lizard?

51:26.824 --> 51:27.849
An elf.

51:37.538 --> 51:39.234
That's better.

51:39.307 --> 51:41.777
You are too precious for words.
