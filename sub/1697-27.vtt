00:03.100 --> 00:05.370
Hey, Rico. What's going on over here?

00:05.420 --> 00:08.930
A wonderful thing.
A wonderful, magical thing.

00:09.700 --> 00:13.450
The mother ship's finally coming back
to take you to Planet Shortdork?

00:14.900 --> 00:16.090
No.

00:17.580 --> 00:21.120
That generous billionaire over there
is donating a new playground.

00:21.180 --> 00:26.450
Finally, the children will have a swing
to swing on, a slide to slide on...

00:26.500 --> 00:29.170
And your hot dogs to spend money on?

00:29.700 --> 00:31.650
Papa didn't raise no fool.

00:32.580 --> 00:35.140
Now, if you'll excuse me,

00:35.180 --> 00:39.210
it's time to hop
into the world of advertising.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074

00:58.100 --> 00:59.930
Miley. Miley.

01:00.940 --> 01:02.330
Hello!

01:05.060 --> 01:06.280
What?

01:06.740 --> 01:08.610
That guy over there.

01:09.940 --> 01:14.290
When l saw him, it was like we were
the only two people on this beach.

01:14.940 --> 01:16.810
They say that happens with true love.

01:18.060 --> 01:20.410
What if it turns out that he's the one?

01:20.460 --> 01:24.890
At your wedding, l'll be able to say that
l was standing right next to you when...

01:24.940 --> 01:28.090
You completely ignored me
and walked away.

01:28.140 --> 01:32.170
Ladies and gentlemen,
on behalf of my wife, Jeanette,

01:32.300 --> 01:34.970
and myself, William Harris,

01:38.020 --> 01:40.730
it's a great honour
to present to the city of Malibu

01:40.780 --> 01:45.970
this cheque for the new William Harris
Playground and Recreation Centre.

01:47.740 --> 01:48.880
Hi.

01:49.940 --> 01:51.080
Hi.

01:53.100 --> 01:56.530
This isn't about me, William Harris.

01:57.900 --> 02:00.650
This is about the children.

02:03.940 --> 02:06.770
About the children,
and how happy they will be

02:06.820 --> 02:10.970
playing at the William Harris
Playground and Recreation Centre,

02:11.020 --> 02:13.930
donated by me, William Harris.

02:15.220 --> 02:21.170
Wow, l guess the only thing bigger
than that cheque is his big fat head.

02:22.060 --> 02:25.680
Now, l want you to meet my son.

02:26.100 --> 02:27.570
This ought to be good.

02:27.620 --> 02:29.370
-Trey.
-That's me.

02:30.700 --> 02:32.450
Of course it is.

03:30.580 --> 03:33.250
Miley, it's been two days.
You got to forget about him.

03:33.300 --> 03:38.240
l can't. l let him slip through my fingers
like this sand he walked on.

03:39.260 --> 03:44.010
This beautiful, beautiful sand.
Bye-bye sand.

03:45.580 --> 03:47.730
Okay, you talked to him
for like a minute.

03:47.780 --> 03:49.850
-You don't even know him.
-So?

03:49.900 --> 03:53.730
You're in love with Orlando Bloom,
and he doesn't even know you exist.

03:53.780 --> 03:59.410
Yet. But he will. And then
you will watch the Lilly Bloom.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.530
-Lilly Bloom?
-l know! How cool is that?

04:04.420 --> 04:06.330
Lilly, l'm serious.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.890
l can't get him out of my head,
and now he's gone.

04:08.940 --> 04:12.290
lt's not like Orlando, where you can
just push ''play disc'' again.

04:12.340 --> 04:15.090
And, in the shirtless scenes, slo-mo.

04:19.899 --> 04:21.810
lnteresting ring.

04:21.860 --> 04:24.160
-Well, l was homesick.
-Yeah.

04:25.420 --> 04:27.720
-Hello.
-Hannah.

04:27.940 --> 04:30.090
Hey, Traci,
now's not really a good time.

04:30.140 --> 04:31.200
Tell me about it.

04:31.260 --> 04:35.450
My Putt-Putt for Puppies charity event
is in four hours,

04:35.500 --> 04:40.730
and l just found out Abigail Breslin
and her partner are wearing blue.

04:41.420 --> 04:45.490
Wow! First, global warming,
and now this.

04:45.940 --> 04:49.640
l know! So, fashion flash,

04:49.700 --> 04:53.570
Team Traci is now wearing mauve.

04:54.100 --> 04:56.770
-What?
-Mauve.

04:57.100 --> 04:59.660
-What?
-Purple! Just wear purple!

05:00.100 --> 05:02.530
Traci, l don't think
l'm going to be able to come tonight.

05:02.620 --> 05:04.730
Hannah, you're my partner.

05:04.780 --> 05:08.810
l can't be partner-less
at my own Putt-Putt for Puppies party.

05:09.340 --> 05:11.210
l'll look pathetic.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.610
-Fine, l'll be there.
-All better.

05:18.140 --> 05:19.490
What did she want?

05:19.540 --> 05:22.250
To make sure l was wearing mauve.

05:22.300 --> 05:24.090
-What?
-Mauve.

05:24.140 --> 05:25.490
-What?
-Purple!

05:26.220 --> 05:30.410
l don't even want to go.
l just want to sit and dream about Trey.

05:32.420 --> 05:33.530
Hi.

05:34.260 --> 05:36.210
Okay, here's the deal.

05:36.860 --> 05:39.650
You wait here, l'll go back home,

05:39.700 --> 05:42.260
send my extremely normal
twin sister back.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.010
-l think you're going to like her.
-Really?

05:44.060 --> 05:45.200
Right, Lilly?

05:45.260 --> 05:48.570
Yeah, it's true.
All the cute, none of the kooky.

05:50.540 --> 05:52.010
One sec.

05:55.740 --> 05:58.040
There. Now l'm as kooky as you feel.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.730
-l'm Trey.
-l'm Miley.

05:59.780 --> 06:01.210
l'm Lilly.

06:02.340 --> 06:04.130
And l'm leaving.

06:04.180 --> 06:05.210
l'm not actually leaving-leaving.

06:05.260 --> 06:06.770
l just want him to think
l'm leaving-leaving,

06:06.820 --> 06:08.170
so he doesn't think l'm watching,
which l will be,

06:08.220 --> 06:10.780
-but he won't know because...
-Go!

06:12.140 --> 06:13.250
You were saying?

06:13.300 --> 06:16.610
Listen, l was wondering
if you'd go out with me tonight.

06:16.660 --> 06:18.010
-Tonight?
-Yeah.

06:18.060 --> 06:21.570
-Tonight's going to be...
-Perfect. For you to go out.

06:21.620 --> 06:22.840
Because l, your best friend,

06:22.900 --> 06:26.490
will be busy at a charity putt-putt golf
tournament filling in for another friend,

06:26.540 --> 06:27.970
a blonde one, who sings...

06:29.020 --> 06:30.930
Too much information.

06:31.860 --> 06:33.810
Thank you.

06:33.860 --> 06:35.650
-So, tonight?
-Yes!

06:36.380 --> 06:38.210
Sorry, your moment.

06:39.460 --> 06:40.730
What she said.

06:40.780 --> 06:43.770
Cool, l'll have a car come pick you up
and you can meet us at the restaurant.

06:45.020 --> 06:47.850
Us? What,
are you bringing your parents?

06:49.380 --> 06:51.010
Actually, yes.

06:51.780 --> 06:54.160
Melon-headed hottie say what?

06:58.620 --> 07:02.930
Ma, you were right. l should've hired
a housekeeper years ago.

07:02.980 --> 07:05.490
This place is cleaner than Uncle Earl

07:05.540 --> 07:08.930
the time he chased that rolling quarter
through the car wash.

07:08.980 --> 07:11.970
Yeah. Lord, yeah, she's just about
cleaned the entire house.

07:12.020 --> 07:14.250
All she has left to do is Jackson's room.

07:15.340 --> 07:17.050
l gotta go, Ma.

07:19.980 --> 07:23.970
l have never seen anything
so disgusting in my whole life.

07:24.020 --> 07:27.560
And l've watched my toothless husband
eat corn on the cob.

07:27.940 --> 07:29.890
Now, l know
the boy's a little messy, but...

07:29.940 --> 07:34.650
Messy? l'd say he lived like a pig,
but that would be an insult to pigs!

07:35.420 --> 07:37.490
l quit!

07:37.660 --> 07:39.890
How about if l double your salary?

07:39.940 --> 07:41.930
l was bitten by a sock.

07:42.540 --> 07:45.290
Let me at least get the door for you.

07:51.340 --> 07:54.850
Hey! You must be
the new cleaning lady.

07:57.780 --> 07:59.290
l'm Jackson.

08:03.580 --> 08:05.730
You must be so very proud.

08:11.540 --> 08:13.130
l don't know
what her problem was, Dad.

08:13.180 --> 08:16.330
There's a place for everything
and everything's in its place.

08:16.380 --> 08:19.250
Then what is a hot dog
doing in your shoe?

08:20.020 --> 08:24.370
lt's a foot-long. Foot. Shoe. Get it?

08:28.220 --> 08:30.250
l'll tell you what l get.

08:30.300 --> 08:32.330
You're going to clean up
this trash heap.

08:32.380 --> 08:35.809
And you can start
by picking up these clothes

08:35.860 --> 08:38.730
and putting them in the closet
where they belong.

08:38.780 --> 08:41.080
No, Dad, l wouldn't do that.

08:49.660 --> 08:52.810
That's it! We're cleaning this room out!

08:53.780 --> 08:56.290
And stop tickling my foot, boy!

08:57.740 --> 08:59.570
l'm way over here.

09:09.140 --> 09:13.610
Lilly, darling, don't l look smashing?

09:14.740 --> 09:17.690
Miley, darling,
what are my other choices?

09:19.100 --> 09:23.090
Okay, look, l'm meeting Trey's parents!
They're like billionaires.

09:23.140 --> 09:24.970
l've got to make sure they like me.

09:25.020 --> 09:30.490
So if that means looking like this
and talking funny, then,

09:30.540 --> 09:35.730
''William, Jeanette, it's divine
to meet you. Kiss, kiss. Kiss, kiss.''

09:38.420 --> 09:40.130
Hello, ladies.

09:40.620 --> 09:43.930
Miley, what the Sam heck
are you doing dressed like that?

09:43.980 --> 09:45.040
l'm going on a date.

09:45.100 --> 09:48.930
Wow, if you don't like the guy,
why don't you just tell him?

09:54.060 --> 09:55.530
Works for me.

09:55.580 --> 09:56.720
-Really?
-Yeah.

09:56.780 --> 10:00.480
At least l know the fellow
will keep his hands off of you.

10:01.500 --> 10:02.850
See?

10:02.900 --> 10:07.840
Lilly, l have never felt this way
about a guy before. l really like him.

10:07.900 --> 10:11.010
And if his parents don't like me,
then that could ruin everything.

10:11.060 --> 10:12.120
What am l supposed to do?

10:12.180 --> 10:14.560
Okay, he already likes you
just the way you are.

10:14.620 --> 10:17.050
l'm sure his parents will too.

10:17.100 --> 10:18.770
Maybe you're right.

10:18.820 --> 10:23.730
l mean, Trey is really awesome,
how bad can his parents be?

10:24.940 --> 10:27.010
Hey, l'm Miley Stewart.
Nice to meet y'all.

10:27.220 --> 10:29.650
What an adorable little accent.

10:30.940 --> 10:35.010
Son, you never mentioned
she's a genuine country bumpkin!

10:37.340 --> 10:41.570
l've never met a bumpkin.
Wait till l tell the girls at the club.

10:43.980 --> 10:46.170
You're kidding me, right?

10:51.340 --> 10:55.530
Darling, please, don't just stand there.
Have a seat.

10:55.580 --> 10:58.210
Or should l say, ''Sit a spell''?

11:00.060 --> 11:02.410
-Okay, listen...
-We'll be right back.

11:02.460 --> 11:06.530
Trey, take your time.
We'll be ''a-waitin'.''

11:10.380 --> 11:14.370
-l know, l know, they're a little...
-Rude? Mean? Horrible?

11:15.540 --> 11:19.370
-Why didn't you warn me?
-Because you wouldn't have come.

11:19.420 --> 11:22.250
And l wouldn't have
been able to do this.

11:26.220 --> 11:27.570
Oh, boy.

11:28.420 --> 11:32.200
Please, don't let them scare you off.
l really like you.

11:33.620 --> 11:36.650
Well, lucky for you, l don't scare easy.

11:39.500 --> 11:42.730
Mr and Mrs Harris?
l have something to say.

11:42.780 --> 11:48.210
l am Miley Stewart,
and l am not just some regular hillbilly.

12:01.380 --> 12:02.410
Hello.

12:02.460 --> 12:05.610
Hannah, you have
to get down here pronto.

12:05.660 --> 12:08.890
Your friend, Lola, is ruining my party.

12:08.940 --> 12:11.650
Hey, Orlando! Great butt.

12:13.060 --> 12:14.930
Putt! Great putt!

12:15.540 --> 12:17.730
Wait, come back!

12:17.780 --> 12:21.970
This is the most hideous evening
anyone could ever have.

12:22.660 --> 12:23.770
Wanna bet?

12:23.820 --> 12:26.330
Look at me, darling, l'm country.

12:31.980 --> 12:33.370
Thank you.

12:35.540 --> 12:37.010
Miley.

12:37.980 --> 12:41.250
Refreshing, light, lemony.

12:41.300 --> 12:43.650
They're called finger bowls, dear.

12:43.700 --> 12:46.490
lt's for ''warshing up'' between courses.

12:50.460 --> 12:53.490
-''Warshing up''?
-l'm sorry.

12:54.660 --> 13:00.450
Well, if the soup is half as good,
this ought to be quite a meal.

13:11.180 --> 13:14.370
lnteresting. What is it?

13:14.420 --> 13:17.090
They... They call it sweetbreads.

13:18.700 --> 13:20.450
Doesn't taste like bread.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.010
That's because it's cow pancreas.

13:26.420 --> 13:28.050
And it's yummy.

13:30.660 --> 13:32.210
Trey, l forgot to mention,

13:32.260 --> 13:37.380
next week, we're taking the private jet
to London for a gala with the Queen.

13:37.420 --> 13:40.610
Perhaps your little friend
would like to come.

13:42.020 --> 13:44.930
Have you ever been on a plane, dear?

13:44.980 --> 13:47.970
Yes, ma'am, l have.

13:49.220 --> 13:52.490
l'm sorry.
l meant one that doesn't spray crops.

13:55.300 --> 13:56.770
All right, Mother, that's enough.

13:56.820 --> 13:59.570
You're darn tootin' that's enough!

13:59.620 --> 14:03.610
Not only have l been on a jet,
l have already met the Queen.

14:03.660 --> 14:08.130
ln fact, l sang <i>The Other Side of M</i> e
for her and her granddaughter.

14:08.540 --> 14:10.250
-Really?
-Really?

14:11.540 --> 14:12.890
Really?

14:15.140 --> 14:17.010
Who wants dessert?

14:17.660 --> 14:22.010
Oh, no, l'd much rather hear about
how you sang for the Queen.

14:22.060 --> 14:26.050
Well, it wasn't just me,

14:26.100 --> 14:28.010
it was my school.

14:28.060 --> 14:29.970
ln London.

14:30.020 --> 14:32.770
Where l went to school.

14:33.500 --> 14:34.930
ln London.

14:36.220 --> 14:38.290
-Which school?
-Hogwarts.

14:41.780 --> 14:44.570
Miley, where are you going with this?

14:44.620 --> 14:47.050
l'll tell you when l get there.

14:47.700 --> 14:50.050
Why were you living in London?

14:51.620 --> 14:54.730
My daddy worked there as a...

14:54.780 --> 14:56.130
Diplomat?

14:56.500 --> 14:57.720
Okay.

14:58.740 --> 15:02.810
Diplomat! v ery impressive.
We'd love to meet him.

15:02.860 --> 15:06.930
Well, we will most definitely
have to do that

15:06.980 --> 15:11.490
in the very near or distant future.

15:11.980 --> 15:15.330
No, there's no time like the present,
my dear, let's go right now.

15:15.380 --> 15:16.440
-Now?
-Now.

15:16.500 --> 15:19.130
Unless you have a problem with that?

15:19.180 --> 15:20.320
No!

15:21.820 --> 15:26.530
No problem at all.
l've just got to go powder my nose.

15:27.780 --> 15:30.650
v ery shiny.
You know what l mean, girl.

15:36.700 --> 15:41.170
Daddy, my date's parents
want to come and meet you.

15:42.620 --> 15:44.250
-Now.
-Now?

15:44.740 --> 15:47.330
Yeah, and they're kind of snobby,

15:47.380 --> 15:49.050
so if you could, you know,
clean up around the house,

15:49.100 --> 15:51.010
fluff the pillows, flush the toilets,

15:51.060 --> 15:54.090
pick the hair out of the soap,
that kind of thing.

15:54.140 --> 15:57.810
Okay. Well, it's going
to take a little more than that.

16:00.580 --> 16:07.090
Dad, one more thing, l kind of
almost blew the Hannah secret,

16:07.140 --> 16:12.730
so l'm gonna have to ask you
one more teeny-tiny little favour.

16:18.540 --> 16:19.970
We're home!

16:22.300 --> 16:25.690
Welcome to Stewart Manor!

16:32.500 --> 16:34.090
Sweet niblets.

16:44.980 --> 16:50.410
Father, Brother, meet the Harrises.

16:50.980 --> 16:52.690
Please, call me William.

16:52.740 --> 16:54.210
Jolly good!

16:55.460 --> 16:57.130
And l'm Jeanette.

16:57.620 --> 16:59.010
Good show!

17:02.660 --> 17:04.050
l'm Trey.

17:05.460 --> 17:08.020
-Jolly good show!
-Jolly good show!

17:09.099 --> 17:14.490
That's odd. They speak with
an English accent and you don't.

17:15.060 --> 17:17.490
Yes. They do.

17:17.540 --> 17:22.369
And there is a very simple explanation
for that. Right, Father?

17:23.780 --> 17:27.010
Of course. Tell them, Jackson!

17:28.099 --> 17:29.850
She had a nanny!

17:31.780 --> 17:33.210
From Nashville!

17:33.260 --> 17:36.880
Who made her watch reruns
of <i>The Beverly Hillbillies</i>.

17:37.860 --> 17:39.530
On the telly!

17:39.580 --> 17:42.010
Now that was a jolly good show!

17:42.060 --> 17:45.530
Okay, this has been lovely!
Thanks for the ride home!

17:45.580 --> 17:51.090
Don't be silly, we just arrived.
Let's all get to know each other!

17:52.060 --> 17:55.410
Capital idea!
You come with me, young thing!

18:05.140 --> 18:07.010
-Remember how you said you like me?
-Yeah.

18:07.060 --> 18:09.170
-Hold on to that.
-Right.

18:09.860 --> 18:15.610
So there we are, Prince William
on my left, Prince Harry on my right,

18:15.660 --> 18:18.450
and the fox just in front of us.

18:19.380 --> 18:25.170
Well, l crept right up to that
magnificent animal and l said,

18:25.220 --> 18:28.010
''Hey, foxy momma,
can l buy you a soda?''

18:30.380 --> 18:32.610
Well, she said yes.

18:32.660 --> 18:37.520
And once again, the two young princes
had to admit that l was the king!

18:43.260 --> 18:45.530
Really, this is too much.

18:47.300 --> 18:49.570
What kind of fools do you think we are?

18:49.820 --> 18:52.050
This is why l don't get second dates.

18:53.140 --> 18:56.840
Can't you see it, Trey?
They're fortune hunters!

18:57.420 --> 18:59.610
What did you just call us?

18:59.660 --> 19:03.360
A bunch of backwoods,
banjo-strumming, hillbilly gold-diggers.

19:04.780 --> 19:08.450
Now, listen here, Bub.
And you, too, Mrs Bub.

19:10.140 --> 19:13.680
Dad, let it go.
l made this mess, let me clean it up.

19:15.180 --> 19:17.170
lt's nice knowing you.

19:19.100 --> 19:24.120
l want y'all to get your snooty booties
out of our house!

19:25.940 --> 19:27.370
Excuse me?

19:27.780 --> 19:32.410
No. l have been excusing you all night,
and l'm done with it.

19:32.460 --> 19:35.370
Okay, sure, my daddy's no diplomat,

19:35.420 --> 19:38.730
but he's not
a banjo-strumming hillbilly either.

19:40.300 --> 19:44.890
He's a guitar-strumming hillbilly,
and l'm proud of him!

19:46.340 --> 19:48.290
And my brother!

19:48.340 --> 19:51.170
Let me just tell you, my brother...

19:58.260 --> 20:01.570
What are you going to do?
Can't pick your family.

20:01.620 --> 20:04.890
Gee, thanks, sis. l'm feeling the love.

20:05.860 --> 20:10.650
So if y'all can't accept me
and where l come from,

20:10.700 --> 20:14.530
don't let the door hit you
where the good Lord split you.

20:14.580 --> 20:15.970
Bye-bye.

20:19.060 --> 20:21.210
Jolly good show, darlin'.

20:22.220 --> 20:25.970
Jeanette, Trey, we're leaving!

20:26.020 --> 20:31.610
You know what? No, no, you're leaving.
l'm staying, if that's all right with you.

20:32.180 --> 20:34.890
-Half an hour?
-l'll drive you home.

20:34.940 --> 20:39.530
l just got to go out to the barn
and hitch up that there team of mules.

20:45.580 --> 20:49.810
-This is not the way we raised you.
-l'm disappointed in you, son.

20:49.860 --> 20:51.730
The feeling's mutual.

20:53.980 --> 20:55.970
You know the sprinklers
just went on out front.

20:56.020 --> 20:58.850
You guys might want to go
out the back.

20:59.900 --> 21:03.850
l'd cram myself through a mail slot
to get out of this place.

21:04.300 --> 21:06.570
The sprinklers go on in the morning.

21:06.620 --> 21:08.130
Wait for it.

21:16.580 --> 21:18.810
Jeanette, let go of my leg!

21:19.820 --> 21:22.250
l'm not touching your leg!

21:28.860 --> 21:31.530
Now, that is a jolly good show.

21:38.780 --> 21:42.130
So you actually eat these things
with your hands?

21:43.980 --> 21:45.810
lt's the only way.

21:48.780 --> 21:50.410
l love this!

21:51.380 --> 21:53.410
You know,
l think the boy's got promise.

21:53.460 --> 21:56.330
Yeah, you should try grunting. lt's fun.

21:58.700 --> 22:00.290
-You don't have to do that.
-l'm not gonna.

22:03.300 --> 22:06.490
Oh, no, it's Traci.
l wonder what Lilly did now.

22:08.300 --> 22:09.520
Hello?

22:11.660 --> 22:15.410
Orlando! You don't understand.
We're meant for each other!

22:15.460 --> 22:18.090
You can't run away from destiny!

22:19.140 --> 22:21.250
You so owe me.
