WEBVTT

00:07.507 --> 00:09.168
Hey, look at that.

00:15.148 --> 00:18.311
I guess we're finally getting
some new neighbors.

00:22.789 --> 00:25.189
I tell you, if that boy handles a football...

00:25.258 --> 00:27.818
half as good as he handles
a cardboard box...

00:27.894 --> 00:30.658
Arlen High's got herself a new tight end.

00:30.730 --> 00:35.167
Hey, you think the dad's a good bowler?
Yeah, he looks like a good bowler.

00:35.235 --> 00:37.601
<i>Maybe he needs someone to bowl with.</i>

00:37.670 --> 00:40.696
Notice how he lifts with his legs.

00:40.840 --> 00:43.400
I think they're gonna fit in just fine.

00:43.510 --> 00:46.138
<i>Howdy, fellas. What brings you to Arlen?</i>

00:46.813 --> 00:49.646
This family hired us to move their stuff.

01:32.559 --> 01:35.892
HANK: Well, I'll be damned.
BILL: They look Japanese.

01:35.962 --> 01:39.090
DALE: No, I think they're Chinese.
BILL: How can you tell?

01:39.165 --> 01:41.759
Japanese guys usually have glasses...

01:41.834 --> 01:44.234
and a suit and a tie, and stuff like that.

01:45.171 --> 01:47.036
Well, a neighbor is a neighbor.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.935
Let's go over and say hi.

01:49.008 --> 01:51.203
Do you reckon they even speak English?

01:51.311 --> 01:54.803
BOOMHAUER: Yeah, man, them Chinese,
you can't understand a word they say.

01:54.881 --> 01:57.213
They just try living
all upside down, what-not.

01:58.785 --> 02:02.277
Hi there, I'm Hank Hill, I live next door...

02:02.355 --> 02:05.222
which means I'm your neighbor,
and you're my friend.

02:05.325 --> 02:08.954
I think you'll find we have
a great little community here.

02:09.162 --> 02:11.026
<i>What do you think of it so far?</i>

02:11.097 --> 02:13.224
<i>I am Kahn Souphanousinphone.</i>

02:14.567 --> 02:18.833
<i>So that's pronounced "Caan," right?
Nice to meet you.</i>

02:22.275 --> 02:24.573
What the hell are you trying to do?

02:26.446 --> 02:28.778
<i>So are you Chinese or Japanese?</i>

02:29.115 --> 02:32.949
I live in California last 20 year,
but first come from Laos.

02:33.586 --> 02:35.713
Laos. We Laotian.

02:35.788 --> 02:37.813
The ocean? What ocean?

02:37.890 --> 02:40.484
We are Laotian! From Laos, stupid!

02:40.560 --> 02:42.790
<i>It's a landlocked country in Southeast Asia.</i>

02:42.862 --> 02:44.955
It's between Vietnam and Thailand, okay?

02:45.031 --> 02:46.931
Population 4.7 million.

02:48.868 --> 02:51.837
<i>So are you Chinese or Japanese?</i>

02:53.206 --> 02:54.833
PEGGY: This is so very exciting.

02:54.907 --> 02:59.037
It's like we get to travel to the Orient
without having to worry about diarrhea...

02:59.112 --> 03:01.410
or being jailed
for our pro-democracy beliefs.

03:01.481 --> 03:05.076
At the beauty academy, they teach us...

03:05.151 --> 03:09.315
that people aren't black or white
or yellow or red...

03:09.756 --> 03:11.087
but their hair can be.

03:11.157 --> 03:13.990
I'm going to invite
our new neighbors to dinner.

03:14.060 --> 03:16.392
We can't expect them to break the ice.

03:16.462 --> 03:18.862
These people are by nature
shy and reserved.

03:18.931 --> 03:21.195
I read somewhere
that the Chinese language...

03:21.267 --> 03:25.101
has 72 words for "rice,"
but no word for "friend."

03:26.005 --> 03:28.337
KAHN: "Howdy, you all."

03:28.441 --> 03:31.672
"Howdy, howdy, howdy."
Can you believe this crap?

03:31.978 --> 03:35.436
You want to live in this country,
learn to speak English! I'm not going!

03:35.515 --> 03:37.312
- But you promised.
- Why go?

03:37.383 --> 03:41.581
<i>I could just stay home, order a bucket
of chicken, watch Hee Haw, same thing.</i>

03:41.654 --> 03:46.421
For once, try not to piss off neighbor.
We kick out of Laos.

03:46.526 --> 03:49.461
We kick out of Anaheim.
I'm tired of running!

03:52.865 --> 03:54.264
Hello, Kahn.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.332
Hank. Oh, damn!

03:57.503 --> 04:00.131
You have damn fine house.

04:00.206 --> 04:02.640
Lead-free since 1988.

04:02.709 --> 04:05.507
This is my wife, Minh,
and daughter, Kahn Jr.

04:05.678 --> 04:08.078
And this is Peggy Hill.

04:08.414 --> 04:12.942
On behalf of Arlen, Texas, I would like
to welcome you to our country.

04:13.419 --> 04:16.684
Please make yourselves at home,
and take off your shoes.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.153
Why? You just shampoo carpet?

04:21.060 --> 04:24.689
Come on, Bobby. Have some seconds.
The girl's lapping you.

04:24.764 --> 04:26.925
I've never had beef chop suey before.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.398
Really? Oh, you poor dear.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.528
You know, I read somewhere...

04:31.604 --> 04:33.196
<i>that in certain parts of China...</i>

04:33.272 --> 04:35.502
meat is as scarce as toilet paper.

04:35.575 --> 04:38.510
- Where you read that?
- Who can remember?

04:38.578 --> 04:42.674
As a substitute teacher, I have
to review all sorts of learning materials.

04:42.749 --> 04:45.809
<i>- Maybe it was on a place mat.
- So you're a teacher.</i>

04:45.985 --> 04:49.477
Maybe you can tell me
why Arlen test scores are so low.

04:50.022 --> 04:54.118
I know why. It's because Kahn Jr. Not there
to bring up average.

04:54.761 --> 04:58.094
My boy here might not be
the best test-taker...

04:58.164 --> 05:01.622
but he's got near perfect attendance.
Tell them, Bobby.

05:02.301 --> 05:06.237
I hope you all saved some room
for my famous Apple Brown Betty.

05:06.305 --> 05:09.001
The recipe's a closely guarded
family secret...

05:09.075 --> 05:12.374
passed on from my mother's mother,
to my mother, to me.

05:12.445 --> 05:15.209
And someday, I will give it to my Bobby.

05:16.449 --> 05:20.249
- At least the Brown Betty was good.
- You must give me recipe.

05:20.319 --> 05:22.719
Oh, Minh, you know I can't do that.

05:22.789 --> 05:25.690
<i>But what I can do
is offer you some leftovers.</i>

05:25.758 --> 05:28.727
<i>Here, now just reheat this
for 10 minutes at...</i>

05:28.861 --> 05:30.829
I've already said way too much.

05:31.030 --> 05:35.660
<i>Well, y'all come back now, y'hear?
That's Texan for "sayonara."</i>

05:36.302 --> 05:40.830
Oh, my! Peggy Hill,
what big feet you have! Like boat!

05:41.441 --> 05:43.807
That's just the way God made me.

05:47.647 --> 05:50.878
Look at me!
I'm like little girl in Mama shoes!

05:51.184 --> 05:53.175
Okay, bye-bye now!

05:55.054 --> 05:57.352
Honey, she didn't mean anything by it.

05:57.590 --> 05:59.751
You do not come into a woman's home...

05:59.826 --> 06:01.885
and insult her feet! You just don't.

06:01.961 --> 06:06.159
Come on, Peg, remember when
you first moved here from Montana?

06:06.799 --> 06:08.994
You called pop "sody pop."

06:09.368 --> 06:12.496
<i>And you thought 93 in the shade was hot.</i>

06:12.605 --> 06:14.800
Our new neighbors are just like you.

06:15.041 --> 06:19.102
All they need is a little bit of time,
and Hank Hill to watch out for them.

06:19.178 --> 06:21.578
Well, do you think my feet are too big?

06:21.647 --> 06:24.514
No, there's just more of you to love.

06:25.685 --> 06:26.674
Ow.

06:26.786 --> 06:27.946
<i>Sorry.</i>

06:35.661 --> 06:39.188
Be careful, Bobby.
That's one of them Chinese fighting dogs.

06:39.265 --> 06:41.130
No, it's a West Highland Terrier.

06:41.200 --> 06:44.533
<i>- Yeah, that's it. So what's his name?
- Doggie.</i>

06:44.604 --> 06:48.165
Yes, Kahn Jr., he's a doggie.
Now can you tell me his name?

06:48.241 --> 06:49.469
He's called "Doggie."

06:49.542 --> 06:53.171
And that's called a doggie, too,
but her name is Ladybird.

06:53.513 --> 06:56.107
<i>She's a purebred Georgia Bloodhound.</i>

06:56.215 --> 06:58.809
Her mama tracked down James Earl Ray.

07:00.119 --> 07:01.984
Aren't kids great?

07:02.321 --> 07:05.518
They're too young
to know about fear or prejudice.

07:05.825 --> 07:08.760
They won't have to learn that
till high school.

07:08.828 --> 07:11.922
There's a real lesson here for all of us.

07:11.998 --> 07:14.330
Move, please, you're standing on my hose.

07:20.339 --> 07:23.570
Dad, look, Ladybird and Doggie
like each other.

07:23.643 --> 07:25.975
Of course they do, son, they're neighbors.

07:26.045 --> 07:29.537
You know, Kahn, I just found
a breeding partner for my Ladybird.

07:29.615 --> 07:33.073
If you're interested in having
a real American dog, I can give...

07:33.152 --> 07:36.451
What the hell? Get him off of her!

07:37.623 --> 07:39.488
Your Ladybird, she real slut!

07:39.559 --> 07:43.086
<i>Ladybird is not a slut. She is in heat.</i>

07:43.262 --> 07:46.789
Her hormones have overwhelmed
her natural modesty.

07:48.734 --> 07:50.998
For Pete's sake, would you tie up your dog?

07:51.070 --> 07:53.630
<i>You tie your dog. She seduced my Doggie.</i>

07:53.706 --> 07:58.541
That's ridiculous, Ladybird can only love
another purebred Georgia Bloodhound.

07:58.611 --> 08:02.308
You know what I think, Hank Hill?
I think you a narrow-minded redneck!

08:02.381 --> 08:06.511
Oh, I get it. Just because I'm from Texas,
I got to be some kind of redneck!

08:06.586 --> 08:09.054
The Chinese and their stupid stereotypes!

08:09.121 --> 08:10.884
Get off my property!

08:14.160 --> 08:17.288
<i>Sorry, Ladybird, I know you didn't mean...</i>

08:17.363 --> 08:19.627
to have relations with that dog.

08:19.732 --> 08:23.862
But I got to tie you up anyway, if only
to protect your virtue and good name.

08:32.144 --> 08:33.270
BOOMHAUER: Man.

08:34.046 --> 08:36.037
Well, hey, look at that.

08:36.215 --> 08:39.318
Maybe Kahn'll let you borrow
his sexy little import.

08:39.451 --> 08:42.215
I'd cut my entire quarter acre
with a Lady Bic...

08:42.287 --> 08:45.882
before I'd borrow that man's mower.
I just don't like him.

08:45.957 --> 08:48.517
- Why? Because he's Chinese?
- No.

08:48.627 --> 08:49.651
I thought he was Korean.

08:49.728 --> 08:51.593
What the hell's the difference?

08:51.663 --> 08:55.155
I don't like the man. That has
nothing to do with where he's from.

08:55.233 --> 08:58.999
I'm no redneck.
He could be from Mars, for all I care.

08:59.071 --> 09:02.529
Believe me, Hank,
if Kahn were from Mars, you'd care.

09:02.607 --> 09:06.543
Especially after he's stolen every last drop
of Earth's drinkable water...

09:06.611 --> 09:09.307
to transport back to his home planet...

09:10.415 --> 09:11.541
Mars.

09:12.084 --> 09:15.019
PEGGY: Come on, stop dawdling.
We have to pick up that pizza...

09:15.087 --> 09:17.783
before the cheese gets cold
and the pineapple gets hot.

09:17.856 --> 09:21.656
What's the rush?
If we're not there in 30 minutes, it's free.

09:23.795 --> 09:25.422
MINH: Peggy Hill!

09:25.497 --> 09:27.488
LUANNE: Wait! Aunt Peggy, it's Minh!

09:27.566 --> 09:28.658
<i>MINH: Stop.</i>

09:29.801 --> 09:32.565
Why, Minh, I almost did not see you there.

09:33.071 --> 09:34.231
Peggy Hill!

09:34.306 --> 09:37.002
I feel deeply sorry about dinner.

09:37.075 --> 09:41.068
We get off to bad start.
I say things I should only have thought.

09:41.380 --> 09:43.610
Oh, Minh, thank you.

09:44.282 --> 09:47.080
It must've taken a lot of courage
to apologize like that.

09:47.152 --> 09:50.246
And I know.
I was once the new girl in town, myself.

09:50.322 --> 09:53.655
Me, Kahn, Kahn Jr.,
have a barbecue tomorrow.

09:53.725 --> 09:55.625
It mean so much if you come.

09:55.694 --> 09:58.492
Well, thank you, Minh.
We would be honored to come.

09:58.563 --> 10:00.690
If you need any help with the barbecue...

10:00.799 --> 10:04.929
or if you just want to know
what a barbecue is, you give me a call.

10:07.105 --> 10:08.129
Uh-uh, Peggy.

10:08.206 --> 10:12.267
I can't go, I won't.
Not after what he said about Ladybird.

10:12.344 --> 10:15.802
Oh, Hank, come on.
Minh and I just made up.

10:15.881 --> 10:18.179
We have to go, and if you stay home...

10:18.250 --> 10:21.242
people will think you don't like Kahn
because he's Oriental.

10:21.319 --> 10:22.616
That is ridiculous.

10:22.687 --> 10:25.554
I hate the man
because he's rude and nasty.

10:25.690 --> 10:29.148
Not because of what
his people did to us in WW II.

10:29.227 --> 10:33.755
Hank, I know that. But everyone else,
they'll say Hank Hill is a racist.

10:33.832 --> 10:38.201
What the hell kind of country is this,
where I can only hate a man if he's white?

10:38.270 --> 10:41.865
Hank Hill, you will go to that party,
you will pretend to like Kahn...

10:41.940 --> 10:44.500
and you will drink until you actually do.

10:48.046 --> 10:49.240
Go on.

10:51.383 --> 10:53.817
- Howdy, Kahn.
- Howdy, howdy, howdy.

10:53.885 --> 10:55.182
Here you go.

10:55.253 --> 11:00.213
I thought you might enjoy 7.5 gallons
of pure, premium propane.

11:00.592 --> 11:03.322
Are you kidding? No, I cook with mesquite.

11:03.595 --> 11:05.358
Give meat nice taste of wood.

11:05.430 --> 11:09.059
And I cook with propane.
Gives meat nice taste of meat.

11:09.134 --> 11:10.999
- Hank Hill.
- Hey, whatever.

11:11.069 --> 11:14.038
<i>Some cultures like mesquite,
some prefer propane.</i>

11:14.105 --> 11:16.073
<i>Doesn't mean we can't all get along.</i>

11:16.141 --> 11:20.373
Just because I happen to sell propane
and propane accessories...

11:20.445 --> 11:24.313
Okay, go stick tank on the table.
Keep napkins from blowing away.

11:24.382 --> 11:27.613
<i>- Kahn Souphanousinphone.
- Okay.</i>

11:27.886 --> 11:30.320
You honor me by giving me gas.

11:30.922 --> 11:32.446
Doggie's just like me.

11:32.524 --> 11:34.890
He's new in town,
and he's only got one friend.

11:34.960 --> 11:35.949
Yeah.

11:36.061 --> 11:38.052
But at least you're not tied up.

11:38.129 --> 11:41.860
If I were, I'd just dislocate my shoulders
and slip out of the knot.

11:41.933 --> 11:46.097
I'd chew through the leash.
I bet it tastes just like a Bible cover.

11:46.671 --> 11:47.695
Hey...

11:47.772 --> 11:50.263
Let's untie him. They belong together.

11:50.342 --> 11:52.606
And it's fun to watch them play piggyback.

11:53.311 --> 11:57.645
There you go, boy. Go play with Ladybird.
Be with your true love.

12:03.054 --> 12:05.887
Wait, come back! You're in love!

12:05.957 --> 12:08.687
KAHN JR: Doggie! No, come back!

12:13.298 --> 12:16.131
Look, it's Peggy Hill! My new best friend!

12:17.335 --> 12:20.099
<i>She's so pretty in her
little yellow sundress.</i>

12:20.171 --> 12:22.571
Oh, Minh, you are so sweet.

12:22.641 --> 12:26.407
I could just mix you up in some Jell-O,
and eat you for dessert!

12:26.478 --> 12:28.708
Peggy Hill, look at husbands!

12:28.780 --> 12:31.271
Too bad men don't get along like we do.

12:31.349 --> 12:35.183
We get along. Men stupid, women smart.

12:35.854 --> 12:37.219
The whole world over.

12:37.289 --> 12:41.282
Hey, look what I make,
Peggy Hill Brown Betty.

12:42.160 --> 12:45.095
But that's impossible,
I never gave you the...

12:45.897 --> 12:47.762
Where'd you get my granny's recipe?

12:47.832 --> 12:50.858
I figure it out myself,
and then make it better.

12:50.936 --> 12:53.302
Her recipe missing one thing. Flavor!

12:53.371 --> 12:56.238
- I beg your P?
- I add flavor, nutmeg flavor.

12:56.308 --> 12:59.106
Now taste much better, don't you think?

12:59.210 --> 13:01.041
MINH: Please to try Peggy Brown Betty.

13:01.112 --> 13:02.670
<i>Would you like Peggy Brown Betty?</i>

13:02.747 --> 13:04.339
It's tasty, delicious.

13:04.416 --> 13:07.874
To be honest, I have always had trouble
keeping your Brown Betty down...

13:07.953 --> 13:10.148
but this here is pure heaven.

13:12.424 --> 13:15.518
HANK: Those burgers look done to me.
KAHN: Not yet.

13:15.927 --> 13:18.555
- You might want to turn them now.
- Too soon.

13:18.630 --> 13:19.722
Okay.

13:27.772 --> 13:31.105
- You might want to turn them now!
- No! Please go away.

13:31.176 --> 13:34.043
Please, Kahn, you're burning them.
That's too much char!

13:34.112 --> 13:36.137
<i>Shut mouth and open mouth!</i>

13:40.518 --> 13:44.921
Boy, howdy!
That is the best damn burger I ever ate.

13:46.791 --> 13:49.521
<i>Stop! Stop pushing!
There's enough for everyone...</i>

13:49.594 --> 13:52.961
if three people go home right now! Joke!

13:53.465 --> 13:54.454
Doggie.

13:55.333 --> 13:56.322
Doggie?

13:56.935 --> 13:59.062
- Kahn Jr?
- Yeah?

13:59.337 --> 14:02.864
- Why are you named "Kahn Jr."?
- My father wanted a boy.

14:03.074 --> 14:04.666
Yeah, so did mine.

14:04.743 --> 14:06.142
My dad is so lame.

14:06.211 --> 14:08.611
He makes me practice violin
five hours a day.

14:08.680 --> 14:11.945
My dad won't let me watch TV
more than five hours a day.

14:12.017 --> 14:16.215
<i>Well, my dad's making me memorize
2,000 words for the SAT.</i>

14:16.354 --> 14:18.219
He's such an autocrat.

14:18.890 --> 14:21.017
<i>What's a S- A-T?</i>

14:21.893 --> 14:25.989
I tell you, Peggy, there's nothing
these people can't make better.

14:26.498 --> 14:30.559
First the automobile, then the color TV,
and now the hamburger.

14:30.835 --> 14:32.029
How do they do it?

14:32.103 --> 14:35.436
With a dash of nutmeg, Hank!
A dash of nutmeg!

14:35.607 --> 14:36.631
Oh, Peggy Hill!

14:36.708 --> 14:39.939
Your husband like burger so much,
I give you recipe.

14:40.011 --> 14:41.911
Now you can please him.

14:42.947 --> 14:44.881
I don't care what country he's from.

14:44.949 --> 14:48.112
Any man who can make a burger like that
is okay by me.

14:49.320 --> 14:50.719
You said it!

14:51.156 --> 14:55.957
It was so good, it's almost a shame
to lose it to the process of digestion.

14:56.027 --> 14:58.723
I tell you what,
that dang old onion soup powder, man.

14:58.797 --> 15:01.891
Just put a little bit of that,
you don't need no grilled onions.

15:01.966 --> 15:04.594
How about you, Dale?
How many you got under your belt?

15:04.669 --> 15:07.035
- Zero.
- How come?

15:07.972 --> 15:09.633
I don't eat dog.

15:15.580 --> 15:19.539
Okay, here are the facts as I see them.

15:20.151 --> 15:23.951
- Kahn served you dog.
- Kahn did not serve us dog.

15:24.022 --> 15:28.356
That's just an awful stereotype.
Chinese people don't really do that.

15:28.426 --> 15:29.393
I don't know.

15:29.461 --> 15:32.453
Anyone crazy enough
to put nutmeg in Brown Betty...

15:32.530 --> 15:34.725
well, they'd be crazy enough
to do anything.

15:34.799 --> 15:38.792
<i> Even if they did feed us dog,
you know, who are we?</i>

15:38.870 --> 15:42.697
Who are we to judge other cultures?
Maybe they're on to something!

15:42.707 --> 15:42.934
Who are we to judge other cultures?
Maybe they're on to something!

15:44.208 --> 15:45.937
They did invent paper, you know.

15:46.010 --> 15:49.275
Quit talking like that!
Dog is man's best friend.

15:49.346 --> 15:51.814
- Would you eat your best friend?
- Of course not!

15:51.882 --> 15:54.749
Are we talking about
some kind of lifeboat situation, here?

15:54.819 --> 15:57.014
I don't want to paint myself into a corner.

15:57.088 --> 16:00.615
Look, I can settle this right now.
That woman gave us the recipe.

16:01.292 --> 16:04.921
<i>See, right here. It says
"chopped meat," not "chopped dog."</i>

16:04.995 --> 16:06.587
DALE: Dog is meat.

16:07.531 --> 16:09.294
You said it, friend.

16:11.202 --> 16:14.763
I was just trying to get that awful taste
off my fingers.

16:28.519 --> 16:29.508
HANK: Doggie?

16:30.821 --> 16:32.584
MINH: Hello? Dog pound?

16:32.656 --> 16:36.114
<i>Hello? I'm looking for dog.</i>

16:36.193 --> 16:37.888
<i>Sweet, sweet, dog.</i>

16:37.962 --> 16:40.692
<i>Have big barbecue today and dog run out.</i>

16:41.065 --> 16:43.226
<i>About 20, 25 pound.</i>

16:43.300 --> 16:45.097
Good Lord, it's true!

16:45.202 --> 16:49.536
I call you back.
Hank Hill, what a nice surprise.

16:49.607 --> 16:52.440
Kahn, come quick! Your best friend is here!

16:52.543 --> 16:54.977
Oh, no, that's okay.

16:55.045 --> 16:56.808
What you doing here?

16:58.983 --> 17:01.747
I can't hear you over my Weed Whacker!

17:02.086 --> 17:05.578
<i>- Where you going, Hank Hill? Stop!
- I can't hear you.</i>

17:05.656 --> 17:08.887
My chrysanthemums! What you doing?

17:09.093 --> 17:11.857
KAHN: You ruin my yard!
You crazy redneck!

17:15.098 --> 17:17.226
We're never gonna find Doggie.

17:17.300 --> 17:20.031
I know. Want to ride bikes?

17:20.905 --> 17:25.740
Hey, Ladybird's a Bloodhound.
Maybe she could find Doggie.

17:26.010 --> 17:26.999
Yeah!

17:27.178 --> 17:28.736
<i>Come on, Ladybird!</i>

17:28.813 --> 17:30.474
Lead us to Doggie!

17:45.796 --> 17:49.664
My God, Dale! You were right!
Their dog is gone, all gone.

17:49.733 --> 17:53.169
I caught Minh on the phone
with some kind of doggie butcher.

17:53.237 --> 17:54.966
<i>She was placing an order.</i>

17:55.039 --> 17:56.666
This is very dangerous.

17:56.774 --> 17:59.800
They know that you know.
And now, they got to come after you.

17:59.877 --> 18:01.174
HANK: They do?
DALE: Yep.

18:01.245 --> 18:03.975
<i>They'll get you with a blow dart.
That's their way.</i>

18:04.048 --> 18:07.108
You'll just think it's a mosquito bite,
until you die.

18:07.184 --> 18:08.674
Then you'll know the truth.

18:08.752 --> 18:12.210
Why would they shoot people?
Human meat's tough, flavorless.

18:12.289 --> 18:15.019
They should be out hunting for more dog!

18:18.696 --> 18:21.290
Good God! He's got Ladybird!

18:25.102 --> 18:27.593
It's still wet. Maybe there's time.

18:28.005 --> 18:30.701
Come on, guys! We got to save Ladybird!

18:34.578 --> 18:38.344
I've been hit!
Quick, somebody suck out the poison!

18:55.399 --> 18:57.367
Oh, no! Ladybird!

19:00.871 --> 19:02.839
That psycho redneck is back.

19:02.907 --> 19:05.603
Why he so mad? I do something wrong?

19:05.676 --> 19:07.803
You're the one who insulted his propane.

19:07.878 --> 19:10.938
You're the one who made fun
of Peggy Hill's monster feet!

19:11.015 --> 19:14.610
HANK: Open up, Kahn! Open up, now!
KAHN: Get my bat.

19:14.685 --> 19:16.209
HANK: I know you're in there!

19:16.287 --> 19:18.380
Go away! I do nothing wrong!

19:18.455 --> 19:23.119
Kahn, I understand that life is valued
differently in your part of the world...

19:23.193 --> 19:26.651
largely as a result
of overcrowding and famine.

19:27.131 --> 19:29.190
But you're in my country now.

19:29.266 --> 19:31.461
You're a crazy man! I call the police.

19:31.535 --> 19:34.527
If anyone's gonna be calling the police,
it's gonna be me!

19:34.605 --> 19:37.073
KAHN: Please! What you want from me?

19:37.141 --> 19:40.133
HANK: I want my Ladybird!
You understand me?

19:40.210 --> 19:42.235
Give me my dog back, or else!

19:44.048 --> 19:47.347
Tough guy, I so scared.
You want a piece of this?

19:47.418 --> 19:49.443
- Dad, no!
- It's all our fault!

19:49.520 --> 19:50.680
BOBBY: We lost the dogs.

19:50.754 --> 19:53.416
<i>They wanted to play with each other,
so we untied them.</i>

19:53.490 --> 19:55.515
They ran away. Now we can't find them.

19:55.592 --> 19:58.288
You what? You mean, you...

19:58.362 --> 20:01.195
The dogs? They're still alive?

20:01.265 --> 20:04.860
- What you think happen?
- Well, I... Nothing.

20:04.935 --> 20:08.962
- We're sorry, Dad. We looked everywhere.
- We really did.

20:09.039 --> 20:11.439
Bobby, you really screwed up this time.

20:11.508 --> 20:14.102
Kahn Jr., you fall in with a bad crowd.

20:14.178 --> 20:16.043
You made me fight with my neighbor.

20:16.113 --> 20:17.808
You made the neighbor man crazy.

20:17.881 --> 20:19.712
BOTH: Go to your room!

20:20.050 --> 20:22.951
What? You say, "Go to your room"?

20:23.988 --> 20:27.014
I say, "Go to your room." You spank?

20:27.091 --> 20:31.687
- No, sir. Don't believe in it.
- No, me neither. I think it barbaric.

20:31.762 --> 20:34.856
HANK: How about bed without dessert?
KAHN: Never fail.

20:35.699 --> 20:38.065
Wouldn't figure a child
could be motivated...

20:38.135 --> 20:40.865
by a fortune cookie and an orange slice.

20:41.538 --> 20:45.531
The cookie may be small,
but it contain great wisdom.

20:46.210 --> 20:47.871
And orange is sweet and juicy.

20:47.945 --> 20:52.746
You know, Kahn, we may deny our kids
completely different desserts...

20:52.816 --> 20:57.048
but they both go to bed hungry,
and that's what really matters.

20:58.522 --> 21:01.616
Guess we're not so different after all.

21:02.526 --> 21:03.891
Boy, howdy.

21:07.064 --> 21:09.032
- Ladybird!
- Doggie!

21:11.168 --> 21:12.601
Doggie Kahn!

21:13.570 --> 21:15.936
Welcome to the neighborhood, Kahn...

21:16.006 --> 21:19.066
<i>Soup-ha-nousinp-hone.</i>

21:19.143 --> 21:22.044
Just call me Kahn. I don't got all damn day.

21:25.315 --> 21:29.547
I'm running out of time!
Give me the antidote, man.

21:41.865 --> 21:44.663
This is my granny's Five-Alarm Jambalaya.

21:47.204 --> 21:50.799
You want less hot, more spicy.
Add nutmeg.

21:51.108 --> 21:54.305
 "Less hot, more spicy,
add nutmeg." Of course, okay.

21:54.945 --> 21:57.539
Aunt Laverne's Chicken Fried Chicken.

21:58.115 --> 22:00.777
Too much Mrs. Dash, add nutmeg.

22:00.851 --> 22:02.580
"Too much Mrs. Dash."

22:02.652 --> 22:05.587
And this here is my very own rabbit stew.

22:06.022 --> 22:09.822
Rabbit! You rednecks will eat anything!
