She found something in the desert.

00:15.599 --> 00:19.811
-It has something to do with those dots.
-Is it real this time?

00:20.104 --> 00:22.689
Well, the bullet in her leg sounds real.

You stay, I'll go. You made your call.
This is what living with it means.

to determine the cause of the blast...

01:03.647 --> 01:07.066
...which killed 32 employees of
the Desert Canyon Heat and Air plant...

01:07.234 --> 01:10.820

for today in Charm Acres...

This sounded easy when we talked
about it on the way up...

-...but now that I see all these people....
-Just find somebody to talk to, John.

Everybody who knew anything
about the factory is dead.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.212
-Well, I'm not.
-Yeah, well, I guess you're lucky.

out there.

No. I see it.

Are you gonna say annoying things?

-Annoying things?
-"I can't believe it's happening."

"It comes in waves."
"I just feel numb."

Or are you just a sucker
for a small-town, homey vigil?

03:37.467 --> 03:39.802
My mom worked at the factory...

03:39.970 --> 03:43.723
...so she, uh, you know,
came to pay her respects.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.017
So you got dragged along.

03:46.810 --> 03:49.604
Little drag, also some push.

03:50.314 --> 03:52.064
Seemed like the right thing to do.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.858
Stupid thing to do.

04:37.402 --> 04:40.112
I picked a gray one. Henry said
I should've picked black.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.657
He looked better in gray, though.

It wasn't the easiest place to work.

So I stopped asking.
