00:06.200 --> 00:09.000
NARRATOR: On this episode
of Life Below Zero,

00:09.033 --> 00:12.033
Alaskans must adapt to
overcome new challenges.

00:12.067 --> 00:13.567
SUE: I like to say
I'm the king of Kavik.

00:13.600 --> 00:15.900
But Mother Nature took me
down a peg this year.

00:15.933 --> 00:17.133
Fuck!

00:17.167 --> 00:19.500
NARRATOR: Andy faces
dark winter alone.

00:19.533 --> 00:22.600
ANDY: There's literally nobody
now to help me here.

00:22.633 --> 00:24.333
Here he comes, here he comes.

00:24.367 --> 00:27.933
NARRATOR: Erik and Martha
hunt the Arctic
for a cunning predator.

00:27.967 --> 00:30.967
The Hailstones
build a shelter
from winter's rage.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.900
The wind is bullshit.

00:32.933 --> 00:36.100
NARRATOR: And Sue Aikens
is forced to wait out
the darkness.

00:36.133 --> 00:38.500
SUE: The pistol has
to be close by.

01:02.733 --> 01:05.067
ANDY: This year,
winter's a lot
different for me.

01:05.100 --> 01:08.267
After about 10 years
of living together,

01:08.300 --> 01:09.600
Kate and I have split up.

01:13.267 --> 01:15.367
That's just the way it is
out in the bush.

01:15.400 --> 01:18.400
Sometimes people
spend time together

01:18.433 --> 01:20.867
and then they find they want
different things
in their life.

01:20.900 --> 01:23.933
And so everybody's
got to follow their dream.

01:23.967 --> 01:25.400
I'm following mine here.

01:28.567 --> 01:30.933
So, I'm here
at Calico Bluff alone now,

01:30.967 --> 01:32.867
which means a lot
of adaptation

01:32.900 --> 01:37.267
to going back to doing
things on my own completely.

01:38.800 --> 01:41.100
And a lot more work for me
on the day-to-day chores.

01:41.133 --> 01:45.167
Getting wood, getting
water, taking care of the
dogs especially.

01:45.200 --> 01:47.533
But that's part of just
living out in the bush
when you're alone.

01:52.300 --> 01:53.867
Who wants to go for a run?

01:53.900 --> 01:55.167
Anybody wanna go for a run?

01:55.200 --> 01:57.067
-(BARKING)
-Huh?

01:57.100 --> 01:58.700
You want to go
for a run, buddy?

01:58.733 --> 02:02.167
One of the things that I try
and do all year long

02:02.200 --> 02:04.867
is to mark the trails
when I run them

02:04.900 --> 02:06.900
and pack the trail down.

02:06.933 --> 02:09.667
On the Yukon here,
it blows really hard.

02:09.700 --> 02:13.133
Any time I have a trail in,
if it blows for 10 minutes,

02:13.167 --> 02:15.400
my trail is
completely invisible.

02:15.433 --> 02:18.367
Stakes go in about every
quarter of a mile or so.

02:18.400 --> 02:22.533
That way if I lose a trail,
I only have to break trail for
about a quarter of a mile

02:22.567 --> 02:23.967
to find the trail again.

02:24.067 --> 02:26.700
There's been times I've
had to come back from
Eagle late at night

02:26.733 --> 02:30.433
and it was blowing so hard
I couldn't hardly even
see my lead dog.

02:30.467 --> 02:32.700
Putting these stakes out
really helped me
find the trail

02:32.733 --> 02:34.567
and probably saved my bacon

02:34.600 --> 02:36.600
from going into an
open lead at night.

02:36.633 --> 02:37.933
(DOGS HOWLING)

02:37.967 --> 02:39.533
Hup hup.

02:41.233 --> 02:43.533
Easy, easy, easy.

02:43.567 --> 02:45.333
Since we've had a little
bit of snow,

02:45.367 --> 02:48.533
I can break new trail with
the snow machine later
and mark it.

02:48.567 --> 02:52.067
But I wanna get out and see
what it's like to run
a dog team

02:52.067 --> 02:54.567
over the existing trails
I have

02:54.600 --> 02:57.400
and then I'll modify that
if I need to.

02:57.433 --> 03:01.067
Easy, easy, easy. Easy. Easy.

03:01.900 --> 03:03.800
Whoa! Easy, easy you guys.

03:04.833 --> 03:06.233
Whoa. Everybody stay.

03:06.267 --> 03:08.100
Good boys. Everybody stay.

03:08.133 --> 03:10.200
Okay? Everybody stay.

03:10.233 --> 03:12.700
Stay, stay. Stay, stay.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.567
Good boy, Jack.

03:15.600 --> 03:19.067
So what I like to do is,
I usually put these stakes in.

03:19.067 --> 03:22.067
We've had snow and wind,

03:22.100 --> 03:25.233
so I don't have
to chainsaw these in.

03:25.267 --> 03:28.200
When you pile snow like
this on it, it disturbs this,

03:28.233 --> 03:30.233
the crystalline structure
of the snow.

03:30.267 --> 03:33.700
Once you disturb that snow,
it packs in and tightens up.

03:33.733 --> 03:34.800
By tomorrow morning,

03:34.833 --> 03:36.400
this is gonna be
hard as a rock.

03:36.433 --> 03:39.667
And this will stay good like
this until the spring thaw.

03:40.367 --> 03:41.767
Good boys.

03:41.800 --> 03:43.300
Okay, let's go!

03:45.833 --> 03:49.633
I've got another crossing
I want to put in farther up.

03:49.667 --> 03:51.600
I don't have a snow
machine trail there,

03:51.633 --> 03:55.067
so I think I'll just go check
it out with the dogs,
see what it's like.

03:55.067 --> 03:56.500
See if I can do it
with the dogs.

03:56.533 --> 03:59.300
If not, then I'll have to come
back with a snow machine later

03:59.333 --> 04:01.367
and put that trail
in real good.

04:01.400 --> 04:05.633
'Cause these are trails
that I'm gonna be using a
lot the rest of the winter.

04:05.667 --> 04:07.467
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.067
Whoa! Whoa!

04:10.700 --> 04:13.133
Good, everybody stay.

04:13.167 --> 04:15.567
Trying to put a trail in
across the river,

04:15.600 --> 04:18.500
there's some rough ice in here
but I can avoid it.

04:18.533 --> 04:20.300
So, it's a pretty good
place to cross.

04:20.333 --> 04:22.600
One of the better areas to
cross around here.

04:22.633 --> 04:26.767
The rest of the river,
upriver and downriver
is pretty jumbled up.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.333
So, erm...

04:28.367 --> 04:32.067
This will make a really
good crossing once I get
a snow machine on it.

04:32.100 --> 04:34.767
But I think I'm gonna go back,
get the snow machine,

04:34.800 --> 04:36.167
get a really good trail in.

04:36.200 --> 04:39.567
Straighten some of these...
These big S turns out.

04:39.600 --> 04:40.533
Stake it real good.

04:40.567 --> 04:42.333
And then I got myself
a good crossing

04:42.367 --> 04:43.667
for the rest of
the winter here.

04:44.100 --> 04:45.767
(WHISTLES) Hup.

04:51.133 --> 04:53.067
SUE: The older I get,
the more I slow down.

04:53.100 --> 04:54.600
Everybody does. Age happens.

04:56.433 --> 04:58.733
Show me the expiration date
and then I know how to live.

04:58.767 --> 05:01.500
I don't know what it is.
It could be tomorrow,
it could be 10 years from now.

05:01.533 --> 05:03.333
It could be 100 years
from now.

05:03.367 --> 05:06.567
But I have to be as close
to 100% as a body can get.

05:21.400 --> 05:24.267
You know, this is the
dark part of the winter.

05:24.300 --> 05:27.667
I only have a few hours
of ambient light.

05:27.700 --> 05:29.467
My main generator is down

05:29.500 --> 05:33.600
and, I mean, I can't express
the importance of getting it
back up and running.

05:33.633 --> 05:36.500
Besides, obviously, the
comfort of power and lights,

05:36.533 --> 05:38.333
it gives me
spotlights outside.

05:38.367 --> 05:40.233
If I have to go
work on something

05:40.267 --> 05:43.800
and if a rabid
or dangerous animal
is out there,

05:43.833 --> 05:45.100
I can't protect myself.

05:45.133 --> 05:46.933
That's unacceptable to me.

05:46.967 --> 05:48.333
I'm losing my light,

05:48.367 --> 05:50.300
it's getting colder,
I'm getting the storm in.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.600
I need to get that thing
dug out so that
I can get it running.

05:59.900 --> 06:02.067
Are you friggin' serious?

06:03.367 --> 06:04.667
As you can see,

06:04.700 --> 06:07.067
I got... I got drifts
building up inside.

06:07.100 --> 06:11.267
Any crack in the tent,
any anything

06:12.067 --> 06:13.767
and Mother Nature finds a way.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.400
Fifty, sixty below weather,

06:15.433 --> 06:18.733
it's nothing to mess with
and that oil is frozen.

06:18.767 --> 06:21.800
You know, a big old chunk
of ice doesn't lubricate.

06:21.833 --> 06:24.067
Engines, you just don't just
cold-start things.

06:24.100 --> 06:27.067
You know, I've gotta
get it over here,
warm it up.

06:27.067 --> 06:29.467
What I am doing is

06:30.267 --> 06:32.400
trying to cover the generator

06:32.433 --> 06:35.367
so that when I get this
heater close,

06:36.433 --> 06:39.300
I am actually
heating the generator

06:39.333 --> 06:40.933
and not trying
to heat the whole shop.

06:40.967 --> 06:44.067
If it's 30 below here,
that's 30 below.

06:44.067 --> 06:45.533
I've got to take that little,
bitty heater

06:45.567 --> 06:48.400
and try to heat it up
to about 50 above.

06:48.433 --> 06:50.767
So I'm asking for an
80-degree temperature change.

06:52.833 --> 06:55.533
(MOTOR STARTING)

07:01.767 --> 07:05.333
Cover it up, there we go.

07:05.367 --> 07:07.067
What that's gonna do now,

07:07.067 --> 07:11.067
that heat's gonna run,
hopefully start heating
up the generator.

07:11.067 --> 07:13.300
As soon as
I think it's heated up enough,

07:13.333 --> 07:15.667
we'll go ahead and
try and crank her over.

07:15.700 --> 07:18.533
It's not a quick fix
and it's done.

07:18.567 --> 07:19.767
Here on the north slope,

07:19.800 --> 07:23.200
the most minute of problems
can take a long time.

07:24.867 --> 07:26.867
CHIP: What we try to do
is we give our kids as much

07:26.900 --> 07:29.800
of the most useful knowledge
as we can find up here.

07:29.833 --> 07:31.567
And it gives them an option.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.700
Because any of
these kids could go get a
job in a city, and pay bills,

07:33.733 --> 07:36.633
and live that way.
But not anybody
can come up here

07:36.667 --> 07:38.067
and make a living
the way we do.

07:48.967 --> 07:51.700
Go get yourself a neck warmer.
Go get yourself a ski mask.

07:51.733 --> 07:53.400
We're gonna be on
a fast-moving snow machine,

07:53.433 --> 07:55.467
-so you're gonna need it.
-Okay.

07:57.300 --> 07:59.900
I've got so many kids,
so many daughters,

08:00.067 --> 08:01.600
what if my grandkids
start following?

08:01.633 --> 08:03.267
I don't want them all in
the same place I'm at.

08:03.300 --> 08:04.867
I want some privacy.

08:04.900 --> 08:07.767
So I'd rather put out
a little bit of effort
and make a second one.

08:07.800 --> 08:09.967
NARRATOR: The Hailstones
require a mobile shelter

08:10.067 --> 08:12.600
as they hunt the Arctic
for food in dark winter.

08:12.633 --> 08:15.633
Building a teepee is a
vital Inupiat custom

08:15.667 --> 08:18.400
that has been passed down the
family line for generations.

08:18.433 --> 08:20.267
We're about ready
to go, ladies.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.867
Well, Carol here likes to
follow me a lot.

08:22.900 --> 08:25.133
And I could use
her help anyway,
she'll give me a hand.

08:25.167 --> 08:26.400
Poles are really important
around here

08:26.433 --> 08:28.133
cos we use them for
all kinds of things. Handles.

08:28.167 --> 08:29.533
We use them to build stuff.

08:29.567 --> 08:32.067
It's really handy to
know what a good pole is.

08:32.067 --> 08:33.800
(ENGINE STARTING)

08:33.833 --> 08:35.533
Okay, we're good?

08:54.333 --> 08:56.067
See this little dense
stand of trees?

08:56.067 --> 09:00.067
What that makes them do is
grow thin, and tall,
and straight.

09:00.067 --> 09:03.633
When they're individual trees
like these, these guys are
twisted by the wind,

09:03.667 --> 09:04.867
they lean to one side,

09:04.900 --> 09:06.467
they do all kinds of stuff.
They also get really thick

09:06.500 --> 09:09.067
and then taper to
a real quick narrow.

09:09.067 --> 09:11.067
These right here
don't taper so sharply

09:11.067 --> 09:13.767
and these are more along
the lines of the poles
I want to get.

09:20.467 --> 09:23.467
I'm not using a chainsaw
because it's so cold,

09:23.500 --> 09:25.667
it would take longer to get
the saw started.

09:29.067 --> 09:31.533
When Carol was born,
we lived in a camp.

09:31.567 --> 09:34.467
And she was born
into this whole thing.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.367
This girl here's got
a lot of knowledge.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.433
I would really trust
myself to be with her

09:38.467 --> 09:41.233
if I were injured and out here
and needing things done.

09:44.400 --> 09:48.133
CAROL: I like to go get logs
and poles for our teepee.

09:48.167 --> 09:50.367
I'm happy to have
the land around us

09:50.400 --> 09:52.067
because this is
our playground.

09:52.067 --> 09:53.633
CHIP: This is
process number one.

09:53.667 --> 09:56.167
Process number two
will be making these
things cleaned up.

09:56.200 --> 09:57.800
Process number three
is up to the women.

09:57.833 --> 09:59.533
A lot of sewing to be done.

09:59.567 --> 10:01.500
That's pretty much it when it
comes to a teepee tent.

10:03.967 --> 10:05.833
People do everything the
way they want to.

10:05.867 --> 10:08.133
Some people buy out
of a catalogue. Some people
build their own things.

10:08.167 --> 10:09.600
This is the way we like
to do them.

10:09.633 --> 10:12.067
It just depends on the person.
This is what we go with.

10:16.767 --> 10:19.500
ERIK: Alaska is the land of
economic opportunity.

10:19.533 --> 10:21.533
There's unbelievable
opportunity here.

10:21.567 --> 10:26.300
I'm... I'm nobody and I've
been able to run a number
of different businesses here

10:26.333 --> 10:29.400
and I've been able to live
a very comfortable life.

10:38.367 --> 10:40.667
So what do you think? You want
to go find a bluff somewhere?

10:40.700 --> 10:44.300
Yeah, let's fire up the sled
and cruise out of here.

10:46.567 --> 10:47.833
My name's Erik Salitan.

10:47.867 --> 10:49.767
I'm married to my wife,
Martha Mae.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.433
We run two lodges in Alaska.

10:51.467 --> 10:53.733
You know, a lot of people
view living in the bush

10:53.767 --> 10:56.567
as very physically demanding,
which it can be at times,

10:56.600 --> 10:58.833
but I wouldn't live
any other way.

10:58.867 --> 11:00.267
For me, I enjoy living here

11:00.300 --> 11:02.067
and living the lifestyle I do,

11:02.067 --> 11:04.667
guiding and living a
subsistence lifestyle.

11:04.700 --> 11:06.200
I'm Martha Mae Salitan.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.567
I'm originally from
Iliamna, Alaska.

11:08.600 --> 11:11.133
Currently I live up here
in Wiseman with Erik,

11:11.167 --> 11:13.367
sixty-seven miles north
of the Arctic circle.

11:13.400 --> 11:14.733
We're totally off the grid

11:14.767 --> 11:16.400
and we do
everything for ourselves.

11:16.433 --> 11:18.333
I would not want to come
out my back door

11:18.367 --> 11:21.133
and see a huge skyscraper,
or a neighbour.

11:21.167 --> 11:23.167
It's a good feeling to be
able to provide for yourself.

11:25.400 --> 11:27.400
NARRATOR: In between
guiding seasons,

11:27.433 --> 11:29.400
Erik and Martha
supplement their income

11:29.433 --> 11:32.567
by harvesting and selling the
hides from Arctic predators.

11:34.633 --> 11:37.367
Martha and I are gonna ride
just a couple miles down-river

11:37.400 --> 11:38.600
to a little bluff I know.

11:38.633 --> 11:40.967
It overlooks a
large willow bar.

11:41.067 --> 11:43.300
That willow bar's just
chock full of rabbits.

11:43.333 --> 11:45.333
And big willow bars like that
that hold rabbits

11:45.367 --> 11:47.300
are places that
hold predators.

11:47.333 --> 11:49.233
MARTHA: I'm gonna be doing
the shooting today,

11:49.267 --> 11:51.700
which is a little bit
different, but fun.

11:51.733 --> 11:52.667
Fun for the both of us.

11:52.700 --> 11:54.233
You've always got
to change it up.

11:54.267 --> 11:55.500
You can't become redundant
out here in the bush,

11:55.533 --> 11:56.733
otherwise you get bored.

12:09.800 --> 12:12.133
That's not cool.

12:12.167 --> 12:14.067
ERIK: The whole slough
had been shelf ice.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.933
There's about 24 inches of ice

12:15.967 --> 12:20.167
and then there's about
36 inches of air
above the ground.

12:20.200 --> 12:21.467
Just suspended ice,

12:21.500 --> 12:25.067
just where the whole
river collapsed right here.

12:25.067 --> 12:26.900
Do you wanna crawl up
on that bank

12:26.933 --> 12:29.933
and I'll try to rally
the snow machine
to get around it or...

12:29.967 --> 12:32.933
Yeah, that sounds good.
I'm probably gonna go
over on this side.

12:32.967 --> 12:35.600
This is what happens when
you go and you motor
around in Alaska.

12:35.633 --> 12:39.467
The wild just presents
challenges for you and
you've got to overcome.

12:39.500 --> 12:41.900
About a three-foot piece
of shelf ice

12:41.933 --> 12:44.067
and then this part
all collapsed.

12:45.733 --> 12:47.533
You know what?

12:47.567 --> 12:49.733
I think I can
just jump off that.

13:05.567 --> 13:07.067
It's all good, baby!

13:07.067 --> 13:09.467
I was thinking about
beating my machine up
through the brush,

13:09.500 --> 13:11.867
but I got down on the
fallen ice

13:11.900 --> 13:14.667
and I'd seen it was
pretty solid so I just
jumped the son of a bitch.

13:14.700 --> 13:15.833
You got to stay aware.

13:15.867 --> 13:18.133
You got to, stay on point
all the time.

13:18.167 --> 13:19.900
As soon as
you're lackadaisical

13:19.933 --> 13:22.267
or you're not
paying attention,
that's when you can get hurt.

13:24.700 --> 13:26.367
Got it.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.600
We're just gonna continue
safely along here,

13:28.633 --> 13:30.500
have Martha get back
on the sled,

13:30.533 --> 13:32.433
and go set up and
do some calling.

13:32.467 --> 13:34.733
NARRATOR: Erik and Martha
are hunting the Arctic

13:34.767 --> 13:36.267
for fur-bearing predators,

13:36.300 --> 13:39.833
as their hides will provide
income during dark winter.

13:39.867 --> 13:42.533
I don't know. I...
I think we should go a little
bit further, actually.

13:42.567 --> 13:43.767
This isn't...

13:43.800 --> 13:45.667
It's not thick enough in here.

13:45.700 --> 13:50.233
There's obviously a lot
of science that goes into
a good set-up to call,

13:50.267 --> 13:52.567
but when it comes down to it,
you need a little bit of luck.

13:52.600 --> 13:54.533
The vibe isn't quite
right for me here.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.100
But down the river a
little further

13:56.133 --> 13:58.367
I know where there's
a nice little bluff.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.833
It's about the same
height as this

14:00.867 --> 14:02.267
but there's
a lot more willows.

14:02.300 --> 14:03.667
It's holding a lot
of rabbits in there.

14:03.700 --> 14:06.200
-That's where the predators
are gonna be.
-Okay.

14:06.233 --> 14:08.133
Plus the wind is coming
right down this creek here,

14:08.167 --> 14:09.500
blowing out on the river.

14:09.533 --> 14:11.933
-So anything that comes
is gonna smell us.
-Smell us, yeah.

14:11.967 --> 14:13.400
Let's roll down another mile

14:13.433 --> 14:15.467
to the spot I know.
It'll be way better.

14:17.300 --> 14:19.833
Right here, we're at about
noon right now.

14:19.867 --> 14:22.467
It's just getting light.
It's gonna get a
little bit lighter,

14:22.500 --> 14:26.233
so we have maybe another
hour of daylight.

14:36.067 --> 14:39.767
ANDY: If you're not adaptable,
you're not gonna
do well out here.

14:39.800 --> 14:43.367
You've gotta be quick
on your feet to think
and problem solve.

14:43.400 --> 14:46.067
And if you're a little
bit creative in your
problem-solving,

14:46.100 --> 14:47.633
you do just fine out here.

14:57.533 --> 14:58.967
So I just ran the dogs.

14:59.067 --> 15:00.867
I got a few more hours
left of sunlight.

15:00.900 --> 15:04.300
I think I'll go in and try
and get a base down
with my snow machine.

15:04.333 --> 15:06.900
It's hard-packed
underneath the soft snow.

15:06.933 --> 15:08.100
(SNOW MACHINE BEEPING)

15:10.067 --> 15:11.367
(ENGINE STUTTERING)

15:13.067 --> 15:14.633
Uh-oh.

15:15.900 --> 15:17.267
That doesn't sound right.

15:17.300 --> 15:18.600
(ENGINE SPUTTERING)

15:20.500 --> 15:22.333
I got nothing.

15:23.100 --> 15:24.800
Absolutely nothing.

15:24.833 --> 15:26.167
Son of a bitch.

15:26.833 --> 15:28.133
What's going on?

15:29.533 --> 15:30.633
Nothing.

15:31.067 --> 15:32.767
Well,

15:33.567 --> 15:35.767
that means that

15:37.200 --> 15:39.967
I've got problems
with my battery, so...

15:40.067 --> 15:42.633
I think I'm just gonna go
ahead and order
another battery.

15:42.667 --> 15:45.900
I'll be able to run
tomorrow to go get it.

15:45.933 --> 15:48.200
The good thing about what's
happening right now

15:48.233 --> 15:49.900
is it's happening in my yard.

15:49.933 --> 15:54.467
If this happened
out in the field,
I'd be walking right now.

15:54.500 --> 15:58.367
So my day of
breaking trail is
put on hold now.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.300
But I still got a lot of
work ahead of me.

16:02.433 --> 16:04.200
Who needs a little straw?

16:04.233 --> 16:06.300
Huh? I know
Cougaran does.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.667
A lot of adaptation

16:07.700 --> 16:10.600
to going back to doing
things on my own, completely.

16:10.633 --> 16:13.867
And, you know, a big part of
what's changing for me

16:13.900 --> 16:15.333
is the size of my kennel.

16:15.367 --> 16:18.600
I decided to get down to
about 12 working dogs.

16:18.633 --> 16:20.200
Twelve is manageable

16:20.233 --> 16:21.733
when you're alone

16:21.767 --> 16:23.200
and, er,

16:23.233 --> 16:25.200
so I've gotten down to that.
I've given some dogs away

16:25.233 --> 16:26.800
I've sold a few dogs.

16:26.833 --> 16:28.200
And, erm,

16:29.600 --> 16:31.267
I'll just take this
winter to reassess

16:31.300 --> 16:34.067
what I want to do in
the future with my dogs.

16:34.067 --> 16:35.533
That's gonna be a nice bed.

16:36.067 --> 16:37.967
Yeah. Oh, boy.

16:38.067 --> 16:39.700
Oh, you like that, huh?

16:39.733 --> 16:41.633
I guess one of the big changes

16:41.667 --> 16:45.100
for me is that I am spending
more time with my dogs.

16:47.067 --> 16:50.767
They just bring a smile
to my face and all in all,

16:50.800 --> 16:52.800
every day I go out and
do something with my dogs,

16:52.833 --> 16:56.200
I feel like it's...
That's the payoff for all
the work I put in.

16:57.067 --> 16:59.600
(LAUGHS) Deckle!

16:59.633 --> 17:01.367
We're all pretty
tied to each other.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.167
It's a really
symbiotic relationship.

17:03.200 --> 17:06.167
They depend on me
to feed them, and clean
their dog lot,

17:06.200 --> 17:08.867
and take care of them,
and make sure they got
straw in their house

17:08.900 --> 17:10.467
when it's cold.

17:10.500 --> 17:13.067
And I depend on them
to get me from
point A to point B,

17:13.067 --> 17:14.900
haul wood, haul water.

17:14.933 --> 17:16.767
So it's... It's a good life.

17:21.200 --> 17:24.967
SUE: I don't know the first
thing about some of
the things that I fix.

17:25.067 --> 17:27.333
But when I get it done
or I figure it out,

17:27.367 --> 17:29.267
I'm pretty freakin'
proud of myself.

17:31.167 --> 17:33.800
Fat, 50, and fabulous.
That's me.

17:42.567 --> 17:44.100
Well, welcome to
the world of Sue,

17:44.133 --> 17:46.067
the non-electrical version.

17:50.800 --> 17:55.700
Basically, you know, the
generator is not running.

17:55.733 --> 17:59.567
And for me to have power,

17:59.600 --> 18:00.800
I do have an option.

18:00.833 --> 18:04.200
I have a small, 2,000-watt
portable generator,

18:04.233 --> 18:05.867
but it's heating up
the main generator

18:05.900 --> 18:07.400
so I can try to
get it started.

18:07.433 --> 18:09.067
So here I sit in the dark.

18:09.100 --> 18:13.067
For me, while I'm out of
power, the pistol,

18:13.067 --> 18:15.200
you know, has to be close by.

18:15.233 --> 18:17.167
This year, both the states
and the feds

18:17.200 --> 18:20.267
have gotten a hold of me
and said, "Hey, there's a
severe outbreak of rabies

18:20.300 --> 18:22.800
"and distemper out there.
Don't take a chance."

18:22.833 --> 18:26.900
I've got to limit my
exterior activities
during the dark.

18:26.933 --> 18:29.900
For me, without power,

18:29.933 --> 18:33.333
you can look out my window
and you're not gonna
see very far.

18:33.367 --> 18:36.700
So you know, I mean,
I've said it a million times,
nature's king.

18:36.733 --> 18:38.133
You know, I'm just a visitor.

18:38.167 --> 18:40.900
I'm not, you know,
I like to say I'm
the king of Kavik

18:40.933 --> 18:42.800
but Mother Nature took me
down a peg this year.

19:01.567 --> 19:03.867
Time for me to check on
the generator,

19:03.900 --> 19:05.733
to see if it's warm enough.

19:05.767 --> 19:07.300
Maybe it'll kick over.

19:12.700 --> 19:14.100
Well, let's see.

19:15.133 --> 19:17.067
I put my hand under.

19:17.067 --> 19:19.267
It's fairly warm in there.

19:20.633 --> 19:21.767
Okay.

19:21.800 --> 19:24.400
It's warmed up.

19:25.867 --> 19:28.300
So, I mean, here goes...
Here goes nothing.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.300
(MOTOR RUNNING)

19:35.833 --> 19:38.067
(MOTOR DYING)

19:38.100 --> 19:40.100
Oh, shit.

19:40.133 --> 19:42.300
All right, well, it started.

19:42.333 --> 19:44.433
It didn't want
to stay started.

19:44.467 --> 19:47.833
So, when it cuts out like that
it's not getting enough
fuel or something.

19:47.867 --> 19:51.067
All right. I wanna take
this, the little bleeder bolt.

19:51.067 --> 19:54.167
You loosen it when
you're trying to
bleed the system,

19:54.200 --> 19:56.533
which means air
is in the system.

19:56.567 --> 19:58.800
Air will not
combust by itself.

19:58.833 --> 20:00.333
So, you have to
bleed that out,

20:00.367 --> 20:01.800
hence you have a bleeder bolt.

20:01.833 --> 20:04.367
I should probably loosen it

20:04.400 --> 20:06.767
so that any remaining air
can bleed out.

20:08.967 --> 20:11.400
So, I loosened it just a...
Just a smidge.

20:12.100 --> 20:14.267
(MOTOR STARTING AND STOPPING)

20:14.300 --> 20:16.333
Come on. Come on.

20:17.667 --> 20:19.033
What the fuck is that?

20:19.067 --> 20:21.000
Ah! Fuck!

20:24.700 --> 20:28.367
What I discovered is the
bleeder bolt is no good.

20:29.200 --> 20:31.900
Erm, I... What do I notice?

20:31.933 --> 20:35.900
When this is loose it will
allow that fuel to seep.

20:35.933 --> 20:38.367
As you can see,
there's no fuel.

20:38.400 --> 20:41.733
There should be fuel
puking out and there's not.

20:41.767 --> 20:45.567
So, you know, I really need
to get on the horn and call
Bob to fly out.

20:45.600 --> 20:48.167
I mean, it's just so silly.
It's a tiny little bolt.

20:48.200 --> 20:52.400
But it doesn't matter if it's
one stupid bolt.

20:52.433 --> 20:54.800
If it keeps it from running,
you know, I've got to fix it.

20:56.133 --> 20:57.600
CHIP: If you think
about yourself,

20:57.633 --> 21:00.433
then you've got, like,
10 people thinking
of 10 people.

21:00.467 --> 21:02.933
But if we all think of each
other, we've got one mind.

21:02.967 --> 21:05.433
We all work together.
It's a common goal.

21:13.933 --> 21:15.133
Here, check out these stakes.

21:15.167 --> 21:16.900
I got all these scraped
up real good.

21:16.933 --> 21:18.167
-Right on.
-Every burr gone.

21:18.200 --> 21:20.067
They won't even make a
hole in our tarps,

21:20.067 --> 21:21.933
-yeah, or our canvas.
-Nothing will make a hole
in the tarps. Nope.

21:21.967 --> 21:23.633
That takes a lot of work.
Thank you.

21:23.667 --> 21:24.933
CHIP: Yep. No problem.

21:24.967 --> 21:26.667
NARRATOR: Chip and Agnes
are teaching their daughters

21:26.700 --> 21:28.267
to construct a teepee,

21:28.300 --> 21:30.267
a native tradition that
will provide shelter

21:30.300 --> 21:33.433
from the Arctic's wrath
as they hunt for food.

21:33.467 --> 21:36.100
Right now we are measuring
the cloth for our teepee.

21:36.133 --> 21:39.633
We stay in teepees a lot.

21:39.667 --> 21:42.500
I'm, of course, gonna be
following them out
to go camping,

21:42.533 --> 21:45.567
so I want my own teepee
to stay in with my sisters

21:45.600 --> 21:47.600
cos we've already got one
for my parents made.

21:51.500 --> 21:54.467
Notice how he's making it
into a circle, Qutan?

21:54.500 --> 21:56.600
And then when we put
all the poles up,

21:56.633 --> 22:00.567
all the two ends
will meet together
and form into a teepee.

22:01.900 --> 22:03.700
Working together makes
things a lot easier

22:03.733 --> 22:07.333
rather than me and Chip
trying to do this
all by ourselves.

22:07.367 --> 22:10.067
Working together makes
everything a lot easier.

22:10.100 --> 22:11.367
Well, let's pile the poles,

22:11.400 --> 22:14.067
let's wrap the canvas,
and I'll take care of these...

22:14.067 --> 22:15.467
-The tarps?
-I'll take care of the tarps.

let's go in now and go
get this sewed up.

22:25.267 --> 22:26.700
Now that we're done out here,

22:26.733 --> 22:30.300
the girls will be doing
the inside job with sewing

22:30.333 --> 22:32.533
the canvas together with
a sewing machine.

22:32.567 --> 22:34.767
Me, myself, I'm not a
sewing machine person.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.533
I usually sew stuff by hand.

22:36.567 --> 22:38.600
Maybe I'll get to
learn something today.

22:51.867 --> 22:53.300
That looks so simple.

22:54.933 --> 22:56.133
And way faster.

22:56.167 --> 22:58.067
AGNES: We get to use the
sewing machine today

22:58.067 --> 23:00.867
and sew up this canvas and
we can be done in
a matter of minutes

23:00.900 --> 23:04.567
and yet it's still
a traditional use for us.

23:08.800 --> 23:10.600
-All done, Mom.
-Yay, all done?

23:10.633 --> 23:12.067
-Right on.
-Yeah.

23:12.067 --> 23:13.933
Wow, you did a real good job.

23:13.967 --> 23:17.600
Usually I'm hands-on
and helping,

23:17.633 --> 23:18.733
but everything all changes.

23:18.767 --> 23:21.300
Like, I get older and the
kids start to,

23:21.333 --> 23:22.633
you know, get things done.

23:22.667 --> 23:24.700
And the younger kids
start to bring...

23:24.733 --> 23:27.100
Like Carol helped
with the poles and stuff.

23:27.133 --> 23:29.333
And we just work together
that way

23:29.367 --> 23:31.333
and it just makes life
so much simpler.

23:31.367 --> 23:34.133
And one person don't have to
do all the work

23:34.167 --> 23:36.300
and we just share the load,
and that's

23:36.333 --> 23:39.100
pretty much how we
work together

23:39.133 --> 23:41.300
and make a happy life here.

23:42.500 --> 23:44.200
Right on. Thank you.

23:45.733 --> 23:48.867
ERIK: If you'll work hard,
you can have anything here.

23:48.900 --> 23:50.900
There are no limits
of any kind.

23:50.933 --> 23:52.833
It's all just
being self-motivated

23:52.867 --> 23:54.733
and getting done whatever
needs to get done.

24:14.067 --> 24:15.700
This is our first hunt
of the winter.

24:15.733 --> 24:17.433
See if we can't call in a fox

24:17.467 --> 24:20.700
to really kick off the fur
season and get a hide on
the stretching board.

24:20.733 --> 24:22.067
What do you think?

24:22.067 --> 24:24.167
This looks like a pretty
good place with all
that brush over there.

24:24.200 --> 24:27.233
Let's just set up along
these willows here

24:27.267 --> 24:29.867
and see what
we can make happen.

24:29.900 --> 24:32.467
MARTHA: In the beginning,
I was a little scared,

24:32.500 --> 24:34.367
but Erik's been
a really good instructor.

24:34.400 --> 24:35.933
He's helped me
a lot with shooting,

24:35.967 --> 24:39.467
so I'm not scared any more .

24:39.500 --> 24:41.533
I always like to just
sit here for a minute

24:41.567 --> 24:45.067
before we start the call
and set up and just

24:45.100 --> 24:46.933
kind of let things calm down
a little bit

24:46.967 --> 24:49.667
after the snow machine,
the animals can hear that.

24:50.800 --> 24:53.100
Kind of look out over my area,

24:53.133 --> 24:55.067
memorise the
little black spots.

24:55.067 --> 24:56.267
Over there, across the river,

24:56.300 --> 24:58.233
is where I really see
them coming from.

24:58.267 --> 24:59.800
Keep a sharp eye.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.067
(WHISTLE BLOWING)

25:05.933 --> 25:09.067
This reed call imitates a
rabbit in distress.

25:09.067 --> 25:13.200
To a hungry predator,
it sounds like
something good to eat.

25:13.233 --> 25:15.533
-There's a fox. There's a fox.
-MARTHA: I see.

25:15.567 --> 25:17.133
-He just moved.
-Yeah.

25:17.167 --> 25:18.700
-He's behind the brush there.
-Yeah, a red fox.

25:20.300 --> 25:22.533
ERIK: Here he comes.
He's looking right at us.

25:23.967 --> 25:26.067
Here he comes, here he comes,
here he comes, here he comes.

25:29.400 --> 25:30.567
(GUN FIRING)

25:33.933 --> 25:35.900
-Well, that worked out good.
-Cool.

25:35.933 --> 25:37.067
Should we go get him?

25:37.067 --> 25:38.867
-Yeah, let's go get him.
-Let's go.

25:38.900 --> 25:42.067
So we came up to this bluff
where Erik knows there's
a bunch of good willows

25:42.100 --> 25:43.433
and some rabbit
action in there.

25:43.467 --> 25:45.267
We were hoping to find
a fox and we did.

25:45.300 --> 25:47.933
He came out,
he told me where it was,

25:47.967 --> 25:50.333
I got my sights on him,
and I blasted him.

25:50.367 --> 25:52.867
I told you the tail was
cool, isn't it?

25:52.900 --> 25:54.733
We just got this really
nice red fox.

25:56.367 --> 25:58.933
-First fur of the season.
-First fur of the season.

25:58.967 --> 26:00.633
You wanna head back?
I'm pretty cold.

26:00.667 --> 26:03.600
-Yeah, my eyelashes are
starting to freeze.
-Let's get out of here.

26:03.633 --> 26:06.067
Fairly long shot for
an open-sighted rifle,

26:06.067 --> 26:07.567
and she took advantage of it.

26:07.600 --> 26:08.667
One shot, one kill.

26:08.700 --> 26:11.433
Boom, right in the head.
Fox down.

26:11.467 --> 26:14.333
So, we got the first
fur of the year on the ground.

26:14.367 --> 26:17.100
I got to have a kick-ass day
with my wife out in the woods

26:17.133 --> 26:18.500
and my life is cherry.

26:23.333 --> 26:25.767
SUE: I guess it's not fear,

26:25.800 --> 26:29.700
but there's a healthy
respect of what's out
there that I can't see.

26:33.267 --> 26:35.400
You know, what I can see
I can deal with.

26:35.433 --> 26:37.667
What I can't see,
I can be surprised by.

26:44.500 --> 26:46.067
Sunshine!

26:46.100 --> 26:49.433
Right here is the break
in the storm I needed.

26:49.467 --> 26:52.067
NARRATOR: In order to get
supplies flown into Kavik,

26:52.067 --> 26:55.267
a flight from Deadhorse
costs $1,000.

26:55.300 --> 26:58.367
A high price for a
small generator part.

26:58.400 --> 27:01.133
SUE: But as soon as I can get
those parts in my hands,

27:01.167 --> 27:02.267
gotta get on it.

27:02.300 --> 27:04.833
Sooner I get a fix done,
power is restored,

27:04.867 --> 27:08.067
spotlights are up, I can move
on to the next issue.

27:08.100 --> 27:09.933
Super Sue's back in business.

27:09.967 --> 27:11.433
Fixes are done. Life is good.

27:12.400 --> 27:13.933
Hey, Bob! Hey!

27:13.967 --> 27:15.200
Susie!

27:15.233 --> 27:17.500
My parts came in?
My parts came in?

27:17.533 --> 27:18.900
I think so.

27:18.933 --> 27:20.633
-It's a little box, right?
-Yep.

27:20.667 --> 27:21.900
Awesome.

27:21.933 --> 27:24.567
I appreciate it. I know
you've got a lot
of stuff to do, but...

27:24.600 --> 27:26.067
-That's you.
-Yeah.

27:26.067 --> 27:27.233
-Yeah.
-Well, cool.

27:27.267 --> 27:29.067
-Okay. Good luck with that.
-Awesome.

27:29.067 --> 27:32.367
If you have any problems,
give me a call.

27:32.400 --> 27:35.133
-Okay. Yeah.
-I'll talk you through
putting it on.

27:35.167 --> 27:36.533
Yeah, I... You know,
I might need it.

27:36.567 --> 27:38.167
I've never had to
replace that before.

27:38.200 --> 27:39.300
-Alright, it's cold.
-Okay, yeah.

27:39.333 --> 27:40.367
I don't wanna keep you
down on the ground.

27:40.400 --> 27:41.700
-Alright.
-But...

27:41.733 --> 27:43.067
(PLANE ENGINE ROARING)

27:55.833 --> 27:57.467
All righty.

27:57.500 --> 28:00.700
I'm gonna have to do some
of this with my bare fingers.

28:00.733 --> 28:01.767
And it's pretty cold.

28:01.800 --> 28:03.600
There's no heat.
There's no anything in here.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.067
Bummer that, hell.

28:06.867 --> 28:07.900
But I've gotta be able to...

28:07.933 --> 28:09.333
These are little parts.

28:10.133 --> 28:12.567
This is the good bleeder bolt.

28:12.600 --> 28:14.200
And if you look at
the old one,

28:14.233 --> 28:15.833
it's a little shorter.

28:15.867 --> 28:17.800
This one is broken.

28:17.833 --> 28:20.200
And you would think,
"Oh, well here's a new bolt,
drop it in."

28:20.233 --> 28:23.067
Well, the other half of that
bolt is sitting in here.

28:23.100 --> 28:25.100
I can't just drop it in.
I've got to remove it.

28:26.367 --> 28:28.067
Oh, this is gonna be bad, man.

28:29.067 --> 28:31.100
See if I can nudge it.
Do not drop parts, Sue.

28:31.133 --> 28:32.500
Do not drop parts.

28:35.533 --> 28:38.900
I don't know the first thing
about some of the
things that I fix.

28:38.933 --> 28:42.533
I have to remind myself
to stay calm,

28:42.567 --> 28:44.167
cos that generator,

28:44.200 --> 28:46.400
it's just not
running right now.

28:46.433 --> 28:48.100
And it's my job
to figure it out.

28:48.133 --> 28:50.100
Pretty goddamn frustrating.

28:50.133 --> 28:51.633
But if I have to do it,
I have to do it.

28:53.700 --> 28:55.067
Okay.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.500
You don't want to be on there.

28:57.100 --> 28:58.567
You want to be replaced.

28:59.567 --> 29:01.267
And you know this.

29:03.333 --> 29:05.233
Okay.

29:05.267 --> 29:07.367
And the new bolt goes on.

29:09.100 --> 29:10.767
So snug, not psycho.

29:13.233 --> 29:14.600
Fuel!

29:16.933 --> 29:18.367
Yep, I got some fuel.

29:18.933 --> 29:20.333
It's flowing good now.

29:20.367 --> 29:22.467
Okay, that tells me that
I've bled the air out.

29:22.500 --> 29:24.233
So now that I've...

29:24.267 --> 29:26.233
Now that I see fuel coming
out this, you know,

29:26.267 --> 29:28.767
coming out this area.
I snugged it down.
That means

29:28.800 --> 29:32.500
I have fuel up to this point
going towards the injectors.

29:32.533 --> 29:34.900
So, the next thing for me
to do

29:34.933 --> 29:37.600
is, you know,
try to kick it over.
See if it'll run.

29:38.867 --> 29:40.333
I hope this works.

on all the cylinders.

29:56.767 --> 30:00.333

push down the lever,
send it through camp.

lifted off my shoulders.

about diesel mechanics was
how to bake bread...

you can really rely on
out here is yourself,

31:09.767 --> 31:12.067
and your skills,

and your creativity
with those skills.

pretty big team in
so I can make good time

exercised as I possibly can.

and get a battery for

a little hairy.

that's really essential
to what I'm gonna be doing

33:55.867 --> 33:58.267
and needing to do in
the next couple of days.

33:58.300 --> 34:03.067
And so it's
worth the trip here.

34:03.100 --> 34:06.367
Kind of a rough trip in,
in a few places

34:06.400 --> 34:08.067
and running a big dog team
like this in Eagle

34:08.067 --> 34:09.533
is always a
little bit nervous.

34:10.267 --> 34:11.567
But I got what I needed

34:11.600 --> 34:13.633
and get the heck
out of Dodge,
head home,

34:13.667 --> 34:15.733
and see if we can get
that machine running.

34:17.267 --> 34:19.133
Okay, let's go home.

34:22.433 --> 34:24.133

guide outfitter.

34:26.200 --> 34:27.833

34:27.867 --> 34:30.633
I do a wide variety of things
year round,
all out in the woods.

34:30.667 --> 34:33.567
Alaska's the land
of economic opportunity.

34:33.600 --> 34:35.767
There's unbelievable
opportunity here.

34:46.867 --> 34:48.833
If I skin it
will you flesh it?

34:48.867 --> 34:51.067
-I'll flesh it and
sew it, yeah.
-I hate fleshing.

34:51.100 --> 34:52.533
ERIK: Obviously had
a good day.

34:53.367 --> 34:55.067
Called in this fox for Martha.

34:55.067 --> 34:57.167
She cracked it one shot
with the AR.

34:57.200 --> 34:59.467
We skin everything we get
taxidermy quality.

34:59.500 --> 35:01.567
We try to get
the most out of everything.

35:01.600 --> 35:04.333
So, taxidermy quality, meaning
that you keep the whole thing.

35:04.367 --> 35:05.900
Keep the face.
You keep the feet.

35:05.933 --> 35:07.500
You have everything
so it's top-notch.

35:07.533 --> 35:11.067
I don't know why you
don't like to skin foxes

35:11.100 --> 35:13.467
but you like to fool with
caribou and...

35:13.500 --> 35:15.600
You like only animals
you can eat.

35:15.633 --> 35:19.067
I'll do the sewing
and the fleshing.

35:19.100 --> 35:21.067
That I enjoy.

35:21.100 --> 35:23.300
The taking the skin off
the actual body,

35:23.333 --> 35:25.967
for some reason that
gives me the heebie jeebies.

35:26.067 --> 35:28.067
Just like how anything
is out here,

35:28.100 --> 35:29.400
it requires a lot of teamwork.

35:29.433 --> 35:31.267
So I went out, I shot it,

35:31.300 --> 35:33.800
Erik's gonna skin it,
and I'm gonna sew it
back together

35:33.833 --> 35:35.100
and it will be fine.

35:35.133 --> 35:37.467
Were you excited when
the fox was coming in?

35:37.500 --> 35:39.067
-Yeah, I was really excited.
-Yeah?

35:39.067 --> 35:40.467
-Yeah.
-Were you scared you'd miss?

35:40.500 --> 35:43.333
I was nervous.
I wasn't scared to miss.

35:44.167 --> 35:46.333
You did good. You dropped it.

35:46.367 --> 35:47.733
Okay, we got the back
legs freed up

35:47.767 --> 35:50.367
and now we're gonna free up
the front legs here

35:50.400 --> 35:52.100
so that when we skin down
past them

35:52.133 --> 35:53.667
we're able to just pull them
right through.

35:54.933 --> 35:57.400
What do you think?
We'll get a buck
and a quarter for this?

35:57.433 --> 35:59.600
-Yeah, it will be valuable.
-At worst, 100 bucks.

35:59.633 --> 36:03.433
It's a lot of fun to get
out in the wintertime

36:03.467 --> 36:05.467
and just go do stuff,
especially for Martha and I.

36:05.500 --> 36:08.967
You know, we're
slammin' busy all...

36:09.067 --> 36:10.400

36:10.433 --> 36:12.733

get to go out, and hunt,

36:12.767 --> 36:15.500
and trap, and just
do our own thing,

36:15.533 --> 36:18.233

Hang out together.

36:18.267 --> 36:21.100
Went out, got the first fur
of the year.

36:21.133 --> 36:23.467
Got a fur on a

I'm gonna use to make

37:00.400 --> 37:01.667
It will be a good
little wood stove.

37:01.700 --> 37:04.267
I'll get the top off and I'll
probably transfer the top.

37:04.300 --> 37:06.700
I'll cut it and make it
a little bit shorter

37:06.733 --> 37:08.733
and use the other woods from
the top to make the doors

37:08.767 --> 37:10.200
