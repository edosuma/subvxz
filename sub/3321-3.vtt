01:47.520 --> 01:48.590
Hello!

01:55.640 --> 01:58.439
You are Ragnar
Lothbrok's son, Bjorn.

01:59.040 --> 02:01.271
I remember you
from the thing.

02:02.160 --> 02:03.196
Yes.

02:03.720 --> 02:04.790
Where is your father?

02:05.600 --> 02:07.910
Bjorn? Who are
you talking to?

02:10.560 --> 02:12.040
I was just asking
your son

02:12.800 --> 02:14.757
where Ragnar Lothbrok
might be.

02:15.720 --> 02:17.120
He's gone fishing.

02:17.240 --> 02:19.357
Oh! Fishing?

02:20.560 --> 02:21.960
He's gone fishing?

02:22.880 --> 02:23.996
Yes.

02:25.280 --> 02:26.509
Fishing.

02:28.880 --> 02:30.473
When will
he return?

02:32.560 --> 02:34.233
I don't know.

02:35.680 --> 02:39.230
In which case, I must take
someone back as surety.

02:39.920 --> 02:41.434
Just in case.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.116
In case...

02:45.480 --> 02:48.314
In case your husband
has not gone fishing.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.760
You! Come!

03:05.760 --> 03:06.750
Come!

03:15.960 --> 03:17.792
You have to
come with me.

03:18.480 --> 03:23.953
If you don't obey this
order, the Earl will never
give you an arm ring!

03:26.240 --> 03:27.390
I'll come.

03:28.880 --> 03:30.030
Good.

03:30.760 --> 03:32.638
Then let's be
on our way.

03:33.800 --> 03:34.916
What are you doing?

03:35.120 --> 03:36.440
Where are you
taking my son?

03:36.800 --> 03:38.120
He'll be quite
safe, woman.

03:42.280 --> 03:44.033
I bid you all
a good day.

03:58.040 --> 03:59.554
We did it, brother.

04:03.280 --> 04:04.839
Yes, brother, we did.

04:07.680 --> 04:10.036
Let's just hope
the Earl sees it
that way.

04:12.120 --> 04:13.236
Yeah.

04:29.360 --> 04:30.714
What is your name?

04:32.600 --> 04:34.080
Athelstan.

04:34.360 --> 04:37.671
I am Ragnar Lothbrok.

04:40.960 --> 04:42.997
What was that
place called?

04:46.080 --> 04:47.309
Lindisfarne.

04:47.640 --> 04:48.869
England?

04:50.720 --> 04:51.790
Yes.

04:54.520 --> 04:56.955
It was foretold
that divine punishment

04:57.040 --> 04:59.157
would fall upon
God's chosen people

04:59.240 --> 05:00.993
for all our grievous sins,

05:03.600 --> 05:05.398
and so it has happened.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.636
And that is
why I am here.

05:10.920 --> 05:12.115
No.

05:12.720 --> 05:15.235
You are here because
I spared your life.

05:18.120 --> 05:20.237
Why did you
spare my life?

05:27.920 --> 05:29.240
I don't know yet.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.314
Ragnar Lothbrok!

06:21.760 --> 06:23.080
What is it?

06:25.440 --> 06:28.956
Brother Cenwulf here,
beside me, I think
he's dead.

06:40.560 --> 06:41.789
You're right.

06:42.320 --> 06:43.356
Leif.

07:13.840 --> 07:16.196
May God rest your soul,
Brother Cenwulf.

07:17.200 --> 07:19.669
<i>In nomine Patris,
Filli,</i>

07:21.440 --> 07:22.556
<i>et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

07:25.440 --> 07:26.840
Yeah!

08:27.440 --> 08:29.750
We'll drink well
tonight, my friend.
Ah.

08:36.240 --> 08:37.469
Eric!

08:38.360 --> 08:39.350
Thank the gods!

08:39.679 --> 08:41.318
And not alone! Look!

08:41.679 --> 08:43.080
We've brought
slaves to sell.

08:43.960 --> 08:45.360
But there's more, woman.

08:45.640 --> 08:50.192
More things of gold
and silver than you and I
have ever seen before,

08:50.800 --> 08:52.951
nor anyone else
here in Kattegat.

08:59.440 --> 09:02.831
Ragnar Lothbrok,
welcome back.

09:03.840 --> 09:06.799
We know you sailed west
across the open ocean

09:07.560 --> 09:09.153
and found land and plunder,

09:09.720 --> 09:10.949
as you promised.

09:11.080 --> 09:14.630
So, let no man say anymore
that it is not possible,

09:15.000 --> 09:16.957
and we salute
and praise you.

09:41.840 --> 09:43.115
Knut.

09:43.680 --> 09:46.354
You're too late.
You missed the boat.

09:49.440 --> 09:51.477
I came to tell you
that Earl Haraldson
summons you

09:51.560 --> 09:53.153
to attend him in
the great hall.

09:57.520 --> 09:59.079
It will be a pleasure.

10:00.160 --> 10:01.640
Well done, Ragnar!

10:02.560 --> 10:04.358
Are you coming, Knut?

10:35.760 --> 10:37.353
My Lord,

10:38.360 --> 10:41.159
it was easy to take
all of these things.

10:42.480 --> 10:46.110
The priests in the temple,
they had no weapons.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.712
They were like babies.

10:51.240 --> 10:53.072
Here is one
of their priests.

10:53.920 --> 10:57.391
We captured several of them
to sell for slaves.

11:00.280 --> 11:01.714
It must be true

11:02.120 --> 11:05.079
that there are many more
such holy places in England

11:06.200 --> 11:08.556
and other lands
to the west

11:09.080 --> 11:12.915
likewise filled
with such treasure,

11:14.560 --> 11:17.917
and to sail there
will benefit us all.

11:27.240 --> 11:31.359
How did you find this
place of great riches

11:31.840 --> 11:34.116
when all before
you had failed?

11:35.560 --> 11:36.880
My Lord,

11:39.080 --> 11:41.800
we were more
fortunate than others.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.439
We had Thor on our side.

11:45.920 --> 11:47.752
Thor.
Thor.

11:50.760 --> 11:53.070
Yes.

11:55.120 --> 11:57.112
Then you were
indeed fortunate.

11:57.480 --> 12:00.359
But you understand
that all this belongs
to me,

12:02.760 --> 12:04.035
by right.

12:06.280 --> 12:09.671
My Lord, me and
Floki paid for the boat.

12:09.760 --> 12:14.357
Surely we are entitled
to some reward, and my crew...

12:14.920 --> 12:17.116
You want me
to pay you

12:17.400 --> 12:21.189
when you took these things
as easily as from babies?

12:38.160 --> 12:40.117
Here's what
I've decided to do.

12:41.000 --> 12:45.870
Each one of you
can take one thing
from this haul.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.679
One?
Yes.

12:48.840 --> 12:51.230
And you'll still be richer
than you were before.

12:55.520 --> 12:57.955
Now, all the world can see

12:58.040 --> 13:00.874
how magnanimous
and generous is
your lord,

13:03.440 --> 13:06.239
especially since
you disobeyed me.

13:08.800 --> 13:12.350
So, Ragnar Lothbrok,

13:14.080 --> 13:15.912
what will you choose?

13:52.400 --> 13:53.754
I will take the priest

13:55.560 --> 13:56.755
for my slave.

13:59.600 --> 14:00.795
The priest?

14:14.440 --> 14:15.430
Granted.

14:24.320 --> 14:25.959
Why did you
do that?

14:26.520 --> 14:29.160
Why did you give
everything away
so easily?

14:29.440 --> 14:31.193
We wasted our time.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.673
I never should
have believed
in you.

14:35.520 --> 14:37.557
He was looking for
an excuse to kill us.

14:38.040 --> 14:42.512
Why would we go to Valhalla
after such miserable
and pointless deaths?

14:43.640 --> 14:45.916
Brother, believe me,

14:47.600 --> 14:49.080
this is not the end,

14:49.960 --> 14:51.792
it's just the beginning.

15:02.240 --> 15:03.674
Well,

15:04.680 --> 15:07.275
at least we didn't give
everything away so easily.

15:08.960 --> 15:10.474
That's your one thing?

15:11.880 --> 15:13.758
How should he
ever find out?

15:14.840 --> 15:16.194
You idiot!

15:17.160 --> 15:19.959
Would Odin expect us to
do anything so stupid?

15:21.920 --> 15:25.516
You have your
Odin and I have mine.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.755
Why don't you go
get drunk, spend
all this on whores?

15:32.720 --> 15:35.997
Make sure the Earl
really finds out that
you stole from him.

16:37.240 --> 16:38.959
What a hoard is this!

16:40.880 --> 16:43.111
What a hoard it is.

16:43.640 --> 16:45.233
See what you've
done, My Lord?

16:46.760 --> 16:48.592
Never doubt your power.

16:50.040 --> 16:52.316
With just a few words,
you stripped

16:52.400 --> 16:54.790
Ragnar Lothbrok
of all his treasure.

16:56.160 --> 16:57.958
He's nothing to you,

16:58.880 --> 17:00.599
and you are all power,

17:01.840 --> 17:03.877
all authority.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.471
You can have
whatever you want.

18:23.920 --> 18:25.400
I told them
you'd come home.

18:25.680 --> 18:27.399
Father! You're home!

18:29.600 --> 18:30.590
Little man...

18:30.680 --> 18:32.273
Did you reach
the west?

18:44.200 --> 18:45.316
So,

18:46.160 --> 18:48.550
where's all the treasure
you promised?

18:49.800 --> 18:52.110
The Earl took it
all for himself.

18:53.720 --> 18:57.031
But I found it, and
it filled the boat.

19:00.880 --> 19:04.078
I believe you.
You ought to believe me.

19:04.600 --> 19:07.559
This is a priest from
the temple to prove it.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.990
Priest! This
is my family.

19:12.480 --> 19:14.233
His name is Athelstan.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.834
Although he's a foreigner,
he speaks our language,

19:19.120 --> 19:20.110
don't you?

19:20.600 --> 19:22.353
A little, yes.

19:25.440 --> 19:27.716
What is wrong
with your head?

19:29.160 --> 19:31.231
When we become monks,
they cut our hair.

19:32.160 --> 19:33.560
It marks us out.

19:34.120 --> 19:36.510
If you're a priest,
which god do you
like best?

19:37.920 --> 19:39.559
There is only one god.

19:43.560 --> 19:45.711
Here, you can touch him.

19:47.960 --> 19:48.996
Are we keeping him?

19:49.320 --> 19:50.436
Hello.

19:51.960 --> 19:54.475
I've missed your
smell and your body.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.440
Children are fine.

19:58.440 --> 20:00.272
But I'm still a woman.

20:04.160 --> 20:05.799
Why do you wear this?

20:06.120 --> 20:07.952
All monks do.

20:13.840 --> 20:15.069
Look at his feet.

20:49.640 --> 20:51.120
Athelstan.

20:53.520 --> 20:57.514
Athelstan, we want to
ask you something.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.395
Come and join
us, priest.

21:05.360 --> 21:06.476
Come on.

21:09.840 --> 21:11.354
Don't you want to?

21:13.360 --> 21:14.635
You'll enjoy it.

21:15.080 --> 21:16.230
I am a monk.

21:17.560 --> 21:19.677
I have taken vows
of celibacy.

21:20.120 --> 21:22.157
I cannot touch
a woman.

21:24.720 --> 21:25.949
I never have.

21:40.720 --> 21:42.393
Wouldn't you like to?

21:48.800 --> 21:49.995
It would be a sin.

21:50.120 --> 21:51.395
Who would know?

21:54.440 --> 21:55.954
God would know.

21:56.800 --> 21:59.076
What if he looked
the other way?

22:10.760 --> 22:14.037
Go to sleep then
with your god.

23:23.200 --> 23:26.671
Is this what you
wanted? There are so many...

23:44.440 --> 23:46.477
Bjorn, where
are you going?

24:24.680 --> 24:26.114
Time for breakfast.

24:45.440 --> 24:48.114
What age
are you, boy?
Thirteen.

24:49.240 --> 24:50.720
Thirteen.

24:51.560 --> 24:53.711
The age my boy
would have been.

24:56.920 --> 24:59.071
The men will soon
be going on the
summer raids,

24:59.760 --> 25:01.592
are you looking
forward to joining them?

25:01.800 --> 25:03.154
I dream of it.

25:03.240 --> 25:05.914
I'm already a good fighter,
like my father was.

25:07.800 --> 25:12.158
That's why I chose you,
because you're broad
and strong.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.514
That's deep enough.

25:25.640 --> 25:26.756
Come.

25:48.800 --> 25:50.951
Why are you burying
all this treasure?

25:52.200 --> 25:53.953
Don't you know
anything, boy?

25:54.200 --> 25:57.716
Odin promises that a man will
have the use of everything
he has hoarded up

25:57.800 --> 26:01.760
after he is dead
and wakes up again
in Valhalla.

26:02.640 --> 26:07.317
But the hoard needs
protection, somebody
to look after it...

26:08.480 --> 26:10.073
In this life

26:10.960 --> 26:12.360
and the next.

26:18.160 --> 26:20.720
You've already seen
enough of this life, boy.

26:22.120 --> 26:23.349
Ah!

27:09.000 --> 27:10.559
Mmm, no more.

27:12.480 --> 27:16.315
We don't like those
in our house to go
hungry or thirsty.

27:25.920 --> 27:28.230
I am very curious
about England.

27:29.400 --> 27:32.791
Does it have one king
who rules over the
whole country?

27:33.240 --> 27:35.709
Um... Mmm...

27:39.360 --> 27:41.670
There are four kingdoms

27:43.440 --> 27:45.159
with four kings.

27:46.400 --> 27:48.915
You landed in
the kingdom of Northumbria.

27:50.960 --> 27:53.919
The King of Northumbria
is called Aelle.

27:56.120 --> 27:57.440
He is a great king.

27:59.400 --> 28:00.754
A powerful king.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.560
Then why did his men
not protect your temple?

28:04.760 --> 28:05.876
Uh...

28:06.440 --> 28:10.753
Before you came,
we had no need to
protect our monastery.

28:12.040 --> 28:13.713
We lived in peace.

28:14.960 --> 28:18.112
Everyone respected
it as a place of God.

28:21.600 --> 28:26.356
Why does your god
need silver and
gold? Hmm?

28:27.520 --> 28:29.955
He must be
greedy.

28:31.240 --> 28:32.515
Like Loki!

28:34.360 --> 28:36.556
We have greedy
gods, too.

28:37.640 --> 28:40.200
My god is not greedy.

28:42.560 --> 28:44.950
His kingdom is
not of this world.

28:45.320 --> 28:48.279
Then why is his kingdom
so full of treasure?

28:49.000 --> 28:52.835
Christian people
give away their riches

28:52.960 --> 28:55.156
to the churches
and monasteries

28:56.240 --> 28:58.516
in order to save
their souls.

29:00.560 --> 29:02.756
What are their souls?

29:11.160 --> 29:13.755
I want to learn
some of your
language.

29:15.480 --> 29:17.153
Will you teach
me, priest?

29:44.640 --> 29:45.630
What are you staring at?

29:46.240 --> 29:47.356
Your Christian.

29:47.880 --> 29:50.031
We wanted to see if
he was different from us.

29:53.200 --> 29:54.554
Well, now you have
seen him.

29:55.280 --> 29:56.839
You can go about your
own business.

29:59.280 --> 30:01.795
He's just like us,
but he is a foreigner.

30:07.240 --> 30:08.230
Mmm.

30:50.040 --> 30:51.440
You. Come.

30:58.440 --> 30:59.590
Ragnar Lothbrok.

31:00.560 --> 31:01.755
My Lord.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.959
And how do you find
your new slave? Hmm?

31:06.560 --> 31:09.359
I find him very useful,
as you will discover.

31:12.480 --> 31:13.755
So what do you want?

31:14.040 --> 31:15.440
I want to sail
west again.

31:16.680 --> 31:19.991
I have spoken
at great length with
my Christian slave.

31:20.640 --> 31:22.597
He is not a
stupid person,

31:23.120 --> 31:25.112
however stupid
his god is.

31:25.600 --> 31:27.557
He has traveled
a great deal,

31:27.840 --> 31:31.470
and he has told me
that there are many
countries to the west.

31:32.040 --> 31:34.475
He has also told me
about his England,

31:34.920 --> 31:38.596
about his kings
and his customs.

31:39.160 --> 31:41.470
And what are we to
do with his customs?

31:42.800 --> 31:44.678
He has informed
me of a large town,

31:44.760 --> 31:46.991
near to the temple
that we raided before.

31:47.320 --> 31:52.395
And in this town,
there are other temples
and surely other riches.

31:53.400 --> 31:56.552
No! I was lying!
There's nothing there!

31:57.880 --> 31:59.075
You see?

31:59.640 --> 32:01.711
This town is clearly
worth a visit.

32:04.600 --> 32:06.353
Give us back our boat.

32:06.560 --> 32:08.358
Let us go there
and find out.

32:08.920 --> 32:10.513
What do you
have to lose?

32:10.840 --> 32:14.595
Any plunder we take
will be yours to do
with as you please.

32:14.880 --> 32:16.030
I could go there myself.

32:16.160 --> 32:18.356
Yes, you could, My Lord,

32:19.040 --> 32:21.396
but why put
yourself in danger?

32:22.280 --> 32:26.513
Why not leave it to someone
who has more experience
of this journey,

32:28.120 --> 32:30.510
and someone who
is more expendable?

32:46.480 --> 32:47.596
Very well.

32:48.360 --> 32:52.036
I sanction this
raid on one condition.

32:53.360 --> 32:55.920
A warrior I trust
goes with you. Knut.

32:57.920 --> 33:01.197
You will go with
him for my sake.

33:01.640 --> 33:02.915
Trust me, Lord.

33:03.480 --> 33:06.314
I will take very close
care of your interests.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.676
O Lord, forgive me
for what I have done.

33:13.040 --> 33:14.759
You will not regret this.

33:25.240 --> 33:28.074
He's found a new way
to navigate the sea.

33:30.560 --> 33:31.880
Find out what it is.

34:05.320 --> 34:06.959
Run away
if you want.

34:36.320 --> 34:38.437
I have the Earl's
permission to sail back
to England.

34:38.920 --> 34:41.071
I want to leave as
soon as possible.

34:45.800 --> 34:46.995
How soon is that?

34:47.679 --> 34:49.080
Tomorrow.

34:56.840 --> 34:58.877
We all wish
you success.

34:59.960 --> 35:02.031
We will sacrifice
to Odin.

35:05.240 --> 35:06.913
Are you not coming?

35:08.520 --> 35:09.636
What?

35:13.040 --> 35:14.997
I want you to
come with me.

35:17.880 --> 35:20.600
But the farm,
the children...

35:21.080 --> 35:24.994
Bjorn is still too young,
although he can help on
the farm.

35:26.880 --> 35:29.793
But who is to be
in charge?

35:30.360 --> 35:31.794
The priest.

35:32.040 --> 35:33.793
I will leave him
with a key.

35:34.040 --> 35:38.512
Father! You cannot
place a slave above me,
your natural son.

35:42.280 --> 35:43.873
I don't
regard him as a slave.

35:44.840 --> 35:46.593
He's a responsible person.

35:47.680 --> 35:51.037
Please, Ragnar Lothbrok,
don't do this.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.673
What do you think, Gyda?

35:56.560 --> 35:59.280
I don't mind.
I like the priest.
Hmm.

36:00.600 --> 36:01.750
Then it is decided.

36:17.080 --> 36:19.959
If any harm befalls
my children,

36:20.440 --> 36:24.992
I will tear the lungs
out of your body, priest.

37:18.640 --> 37:20.199
Answer me this, Knut,

37:20.840 --> 37:22.240
are you really
with us?

37:23.520 --> 37:25.000
Understand this!

37:25.320 --> 37:27.676
A war band lives

37:31.480 --> 37:32.994
and dies together.

37:34.000 --> 37:38.677
If you cannot trust the men
to either side of you,

37:40.480 --> 37:42.119
or in front of you,

37:44.720 --> 37:46.837
you are already
a dead man.

37:50.360 --> 37:52.352
I am with you.

37:55.080 --> 37:58.232
I made a mistake before.
I did not come with you.

37:58.640 --> 38:02.793
Now I fear Odin will make
a bad judgment of me.

38:04.040 --> 38:08.273
For me, that's as important
as it is for you.

38:21.040 --> 38:22.520
Just wanted to ask.

43:32.440 --> 43:33.669
Ragnar!
