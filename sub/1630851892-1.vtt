00:52.510 --> 00:55.346
<i>Sometimes, the reality you're facing
seems unrealistic.</i>

00:59.142 --> 01:00.560
<i>Like right now,</i>

01:01.144 --> 01:03.605
<i>as I'm walking the streets
covered in white</i>

01:04.647 --> 01:05.815
<i>after an unexpected snow.</i>

01:10.779 --> 01:15.909
<i>METAPHORS OF DAWN</i>
YU HYEON-U EXHIBITION

01:30.089 --> 01:31.674
<i>It's the same when you're in love.</i>

01:35.804 --> 01:38.723
<i>It feels like you've become
the most special person in the world.</i>

01:39.432 --> 01:41.017
<i>It feels unrealistic.</i>

01:53.363 --> 01:54.239
<i>Your heart…</i>

01:55.281 --> 01:56.366
<i>flutters.</i>

02:17.011 --> 02:18.555
It's so erotic.

02:19.139 --> 02:19.973
I know.

02:38.491 --> 02:41.161
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MOMENT OF A LOVER
VIEW FROM BEHIND

02:41.244 --> 02:43.079
<i>NABI</i>
YU HYEON-U

02:43.163 --> 02:44.539
But why is it called "Nabi"?

02:45.123 --> 02:46.332
I don't know.

02:46.416 --> 02:47.876
Let's go.

02:47.959 --> 02:50.461
-What should we see next?
-Let's check this out.

02:50.962 --> 02:51.796
This one?

02:51.880 --> 02:53.715
-Have you heard of him?
-Of course.

02:53.798 --> 02:54.883
Na-bi.

03:12.942 --> 03:13.902
Isn't it pretty?

03:35.798 --> 03:36.716
Na-bi.

03:37.342 --> 03:38.384
Yu Na-bi!

03:39.594 --> 03:40.887
<i>What is love?</i>

03:46.059 --> 03:48.353
<i>He was a serious person.</i>

03:48.436 --> 03:49.437
What is love?

03:50.855 --> 03:52.899
Constantly giving meaning…

03:53.858 --> 03:56.861
to something abstract and unfamiliar.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.613
Wouldn't that be true love?

04:10.124 --> 04:11.751
-I knew it.
-What?

04:11.834 --> 04:13.378
I asked to have pizza today

04:13.962 --> 04:16.631
because I wanted to get a glimpse
of your feelings

04:16.714 --> 04:18.466
through the act of sharing food.

04:19.467 --> 04:21.177
-My feelings?
-Yes.

04:22.178 --> 04:23.429
Your feelings for me.

04:26.140 --> 04:29.310
Whether or not this one layer comes
between us tonight

04:29.394 --> 04:31.938
will confirm
the sincerity of our relationship.

04:34.524 --> 04:35.483
<i>Almost always…</i>

04:36.359 --> 04:37.443
<i>No.</i>

04:38.486 --> 04:39.821
<i>He was always…</i>

04:41.406 --> 04:43.449
Honestly, this is ridiculous.

04:43.533 --> 04:44.826
What do you mean?

04:46.703 --> 04:49.622
I wish you wouldn't make
such arbitrary decisions.

04:50.331 --> 04:52.542
Do my nails look that strange?

04:52.625 --> 04:54.085
Everyone said they were pretty.

04:55.628 --> 04:59.924
"Everyone"? If I were you,
I would've asked for my opinion first.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.634
I guess I'm nothing

05:02.135 --> 05:03.886
but a mere stranger to you.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.681
Am I the only one who's serious?

05:06.764 --> 05:10.268
<i>He obsessively put meaning into everything
and made endless metaphors.</i>

05:13.021 --> 05:14.522
Was my work embarrassing to you?

05:15.732 --> 05:16.983
Is that why you're crying?

05:17.608 --> 05:20.153
Na-bi. Don't just look at the exterior.

05:20.236 --> 05:22.488
You have to look at the meaning
hidden inside it.

05:24.866 --> 05:29.203
You could've asked me about it first.

05:30.913 --> 05:32.165
Darn it!

05:32.248 --> 05:34.792
You're making me really upset.

05:34.876 --> 05:37.211
I thought you would understand me
the best.

05:41.424 --> 05:43.843
<i>I once believed that it was special.</i>

05:44.343 --> 05:46.971
I'm not sure if I'd like that!

05:47.055 --> 05:47.930
It's a bit strange.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.932
He said it's because he loves you.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.560
Artists don't use just any model,
you know.

05:53.227 --> 05:54.854
I think

05:54.937 --> 05:57.190
he must really care about you.

05:57.273 --> 05:58.816
You're like his muse.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.527
-No, this is really weird.
-His muse?

06:01.611 --> 06:02.695
This is art.

06:02.779 --> 06:03.821
You call this art?

06:03.905 --> 06:05.198
It looks fine.

06:13.414 --> 06:14.415
<i>I was confused…</i>

06:15.875 --> 06:16.959
<i>about boundaries.</i>

06:21.047 --> 06:22.840
Excuse me.

06:25.593 --> 06:30.348
Your boyfriend's name
is Yu Hyeon-u, right?

06:30.890 --> 06:33.267
Yes. Why?

06:33.351 --> 06:36.270
I'm not sure if I should tell you, but…

06:37.355 --> 06:39.732
My friend attends that academy.

06:48.032 --> 06:49.492
<i>It's already been a while.</i>

07:00.962 --> 07:02.505
<i>I realized the truth…</i>

07:04.507 --> 07:06.217
<i>at an unexpected moment.</i>

07:22.984 --> 07:26.571
<i>And to be honest,
I felt like I already knew it.</i>

07:37.415 --> 07:38.666
<i>But…</i>

07:41.961 --> 07:42.837
Na-bi.

07:48.551 --> 07:50.887
I'm swamped with the academy
and the exhibition.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.681
If the exhibition's successful,
I'll quit being a teacher

07:53.764 --> 07:55.391
and focus on my art career.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.561
But I'm not sure what theme I should do.

07:58.644 --> 08:02.857
Mr. Baek wants to express people
in their 20s as lively and free…

08:02.940 --> 08:05.776
<i>But this jerk talked too much
for me to just blame myself.</i>

08:14.076 --> 08:14.911
Na-bi.

08:15.578 --> 08:18.623
Why are you sitting like that?
I'm talking about something serious.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.003
You asshole.

08:27.590 --> 08:28.466
What?

08:32.220 --> 08:33.137
<i>Love.</i>

08:34.805 --> 08:36.474
<i>It gets trampled on</i>

08:37.058 --> 08:38.976
<i>and helplessly melts away.</i>

08:39.769 --> 08:41.187
<i>It's nothing.</i>

08:43.564 --> 08:45.525
<i>My relationship ended like that too.</i>

08:54.408 --> 08:56.452
-Na-bi, where are you going?
-The studio.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.537
Okay, see you later.

08:57.620 --> 08:58.871
See you.

08:59.830 --> 09:01.791
-What are you doing?
-Just chilling.

09:01.874 --> 09:02.833
Hurry back.

09:13.594 --> 09:15.012
Aren't you going to the studio?

09:15.096 --> 09:16.556
-Go ahead first.
-Go ahead first.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.707
-Hi.
-Hey.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.466
Hi.

09:52.550 --> 09:53.759
Hi.

09:55.511 --> 09:56.387
Hi, Na-bi.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.312
Where were you, Na-bi?

10:04.937 --> 10:05.771
Just outside.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.481
Na-bi, help me.

10:07.565 --> 10:08.941
You should do it yourself.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.152
Na-bi, can't you concentrate
for a few hours?

10:21.912 --> 10:24.165
Jeez, what a jerk.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.667
What is it this time?

10:26.751 --> 10:29.837
He's the one who suggested
going to a hotel instead of a motel.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.464
And now he wants me to chip in.

10:31.547 --> 10:33.633
Who? The guy you met
through the app yesterday?

10:33.716 --> 10:34.592
Yes!

10:34.675 --> 10:36.636
I wouldn't feel this upset if he was good.

10:36.719 --> 10:39.347
It wasn't even worth spending
a night with him!

10:39.430 --> 10:42.141
-Why'd you sleep with him, then?
-He must've been handsome.

10:42.224 --> 10:43.601
She loves handsome guys.

10:44.518 --> 10:46.520
This is so annoying. Let's go for a smoke.

10:46.604 --> 10:50.733
No, I'm quitting for a while.
I'm not going to smoke for three days.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.568
What's in three days?

10:52.652 --> 10:53.986
A blind date.

10:54.070 --> 10:57.031
I'll quit until then,
and if it's bearable, I'll keep it up.

10:57.114 --> 10:59.617
-Another blind date?
-You're unbelievable.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.327
Do you like men that much?

11:01.410 --> 11:02.912
You're one to ask.

11:02.995 --> 11:04.121
Point taken.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.373
It's too noisy here.

11:06.457 --> 11:08.000
-You're going to work, right?
-Yes.

11:10.711 --> 11:12.380
-You're really not going?
-Bye.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.216
Then who can I smoke with?

11:15.716 --> 11:17.635
What if I get kidnapped
while smoking alone?

11:17.718 --> 11:20.137
-I wonder if my mother would cry for--
-I'll come with you.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.223
You're the best.

11:23.432 --> 11:24.558
I just got here.

11:27.436 --> 11:29.772
-All right, I'm coming.
-Just a little more.

11:29.855 --> 11:32.108
Do you climb up all these stairs
every time you smoke?

11:32.191 --> 11:34.402
-I don't mind if it's for a drag.
-Gosh.

11:35.403 --> 11:37.947
If he's okay, swipe right.
If not, swipe left.

11:38.030 --> 11:41.242
And if you both swipe right
for each other, it's a match.

11:42.326 --> 11:43.285
And then?

11:43.369 --> 11:45.496
Then you message back and forth here.

11:45.579 --> 11:48.374
If it goes well, you exchange numbers
and maybe meet up later.

11:49.625 --> 11:50.835
I guess today is not the day.

11:50.918 --> 11:53.379
But nobody uses
their real names here, right?

11:53.462 --> 11:55.756
Right. I don't show my face
on my profile, either.

11:56.590 --> 11:59.427
But some people just reveal
their names and faces.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.178
Oh, I hate tattoos like this!

12:01.262 --> 12:02.346
Tattoos?

12:03.764 --> 12:07.101
The guy I met yesterday
had a huge tattoo, too.

12:07.184 --> 12:08.352
You know what it said?

12:12.773 --> 12:14.942
His thing kept dying,
and he says "never die"?

12:15.025 --> 12:16.694
-How--
-Keep it down.

12:16.777 --> 12:18.112
It was so ridiculous.

12:18.195 --> 12:19.947
Some tattoos are pretty, though.

12:22.074 --> 12:23.701
Like whose?

12:23.784 --> 12:25.035
What?

12:26.912 --> 12:28.205
Are you seeing someone?

12:30.207 --> 12:32.293
What are you on about?

12:32.793 --> 12:34.295
As if I would.

12:40.009 --> 12:42.428
Do you want to join us for drinks later?

12:42.511 --> 12:45.014
No, I'm fine.
I'm going to work late today.

12:45.097 --> 12:46.140
Again?

12:47.391 --> 12:49.685
-Life must be so boring for you.
-Whatever.

12:54.148 --> 12:55.941
Look. He's one of our juniors.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.486
He said he wants to drink with you.

12:58.569 --> 12:59.862
When will I finish?

12:59.945 --> 13:03.199
I stayed up all night.
I'm going to have to stay up again.

13:03.282 --> 13:06.494
I just got out of a relationship,
remember?

13:06.577 --> 13:07.912
Hey, I didn't mean that.

13:07.995 --> 13:09.830
We all know each other except for you.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.874
So I just wanted to introduce you two.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.294
Well, anyway…

13:15.377 --> 13:16.837
God, you're so boring.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.591
Oh, no! I accidentally swiped left

13:20.674 --> 13:23.177
-on a total hottie!
-Let me see.

13:23.260 --> 13:25.262
I can never see him again.

13:28.933 --> 13:31.352
You're acting unlike yourself today.

13:32.603 --> 13:34.188
What? What is it this time?

13:34.271 --> 13:37.733
Oh, well. You got rid of that jerk,
so you should move on.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.278
-But this app isn't for you.
-Why not?

13:41.362 --> 13:43.739
You're pretty
but you have no taste in men.

13:43.822 --> 13:45.658
-You'll only attract losers.
-Hey!

13:45.741 --> 13:46.784
What?

13:48.994 --> 13:49.870
Well…

13:52.289 --> 13:53.499
Maybe.

13:56.293 --> 13:58.254
-You're really not coming?
-No.

13:58.337 --> 13:59.505
Have fun.

14:01.048 --> 14:02.258
You're so boring.

14:03.217 --> 14:04.218
Call me later!

14:04.301 --> 14:05.261
Okay.

14:24.572 --> 14:30.995
EPISODE 1: THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS FATE.
NEVERTHELESS,

14:38.502 --> 14:41.881
THE DAY SHE BROKE UP WITH X

15:08.073 --> 15:08.991
You got here first.

15:22.421 --> 15:23.339
Who are you?

15:24.882 --> 15:26.300
Aren't you So-ri?

15:27.593 --> 15:32.014
No, my name is Yu Na-bi.

15:32.973 --> 15:33.974
Na-bi?

15:39.271 --> 15:42.566
I guess I mistook you for someone else.
I'm sorry.

15:43.359 --> 15:44.318
It's fine.

15:44.401 --> 15:47.863
<i>It's silly, but the moment our eyes met…</i>

16:09.051 --> 16:10.886
<i>The pain of the breakup</i>

16:11.595 --> 16:14.056
<i>that had been weighing down on me
just a minute ago…</i>

16:17.935 --> 16:19.103
Can I sit here?

16:21.271 --> 16:23.065
You're already sitting there.

16:28.362 --> 16:29.321
Are you with someone?

16:32.157 --> 16:33.325
No, I'm not.

16:33.951 --> 16:35.494
<i>…melted away like snow.</i>

16:36.662 --> 16:40.499
But aren't you here to meet someone?

16:40.582 --> 16:43.669
You said you mistook me for someone else.

16:44.253 --> 16:45.629
I canceled on her.

16:46.672 --> 16:47.631
Why?

16:49.425 --> 16:50.259
I just thought…

16:54.513 --> 16:56.390
I didn't need to meet her.

17:07.151 --> 17:09.111
The loser grants the winner a wish.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.237
Remember?

17:10.320 --> 17:12.406
I've been conned.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.491
Keep going.

17:16.326 --> 17:17.619
So you broke up today?

17:17.703 --> 17:18.579
Oh.

17:20.164 --> 17:20.998
Yes.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.125
I flat out dumped him.

17:24.209 --> 17:26.128
I guess he was a bad guy.

17:26.795 --> 17:27.713
Well…

17:28.630 --> 17:30.090
he was a total joke.

17:30.674 --> 17:32.342
I was an idiot for dating him.

17:32.426 --> 17:35.554
Good riddance. Now nothing holds me back
from leaving the country.

17:35.637 --> 17:37.598
-For travel?
-Exchange student.

17:39.016 --> 17:40.851
I want to go to Paris.

17:41.769 --> 17:42.811
That's cool.

17:42.895 --> 17:46.356
But it won't happen anytime soon.
Do you like traveling?

17:46.440 --> 17:48.150
I've never traveled properly before.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.527
-I want to go at the end of the year.
-With who?

17:55.532 --> 17:56.408
Alone?

17:57.326 --> 17:59.745
With a friend? Or…

18:00.662 --> 18:01.580
your girlfriend?

18:03.791 --> 18:04.750
I'm not sure.

18:05.751 --> 18:06.835
With anyone.

18:14.384 --> 18:15.677
Here you go.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.596
It's my turn now, right?

18:27.106 --> 18:28.440
Why is it so hard?

18:29.399 --> 18:30.984
Because you haven't done it often.

18:31.819 --> 18:34.780
If you keep practicing,
you'll get the hang of it.

18:36.698 --> 18:38.909
It doesn't matter where it hits.

18:41.870 --> 18:44.706
Just try to get it near the red dot.

18:46.708 --> 18:47.668
Easy.

18:57.427 --> 18:58.512
That's unexpected.

19:01.056 --> 19:02.266
What do you mean?

19:04.393 --> 19:06.562
You look a bit different when you smile.

19:11.275 --> 19:12.985
What are you talking about?

19:14.528 --> 19:15.696
Move over.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.037
I won.

19:25.038 --> 19:26.373
Of course you did.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.877
You seem happy for a loser.

19:30.460 --> 19:31.336
Well…

19:32.129 --> 19:33.172
it was fun.

19:34.214 --> 19:35.048
Right.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.259
It's fun to be with you, Na-bi.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.346
<i>This guy…</i>

19:43.140 --> 19:44.892
<i>is bad for my heart.</i>

19:44.975 --> 19:46.435
Okay.

19:48.687 --> 19:49.688
Easy.

19:49.771 --> 19:50.814
Easy.

19:58.780 --> 19:59.656
YU JEONG-RAN

20:03.827 --> 20:04.786
Yes, Mom.

20:04.870 --> 20:08.248
<i>Na-bi.
Your aunt made your favorite side dish.</i>

20:08.332 --> 20:10.542
-<i>Should I ask her to send it to you?</i>
-No…

20:10.626 --> 20:12.920
I still have a lot left over
from last time.

20:13.003 --> 20:16.548
<i>Just throw away the leftovers
and eat the new ones she sends.</i>

20:16.632 --> 20:19.009
You always tell me to throw away stuff.

20:19.092 --> 20:20.010
I'm hanging up now.

20:20.093 --> 20:22.012
<i>Why are you in such a mood?</i>

20:22.095 --> 20:24.765
<i>I want my precious daughter
to have new and good stuff.</i>

20:24.848 --> 20:26.099
Anyway, it's fine.

20:27.684 --> 20:29.186
<i>When are you coming home?</i>

20:30.103 --> 20:34.024
<i>It's only an hour away by subway
but you never come home.</i>

20:35.108 --> 20:36.777
Because he's there…

20:40.447 --> 20:42.991
I just have a lot of assignments
these days.

20:43.659 --> 20:44.701
How is Ttoli?

20:45.410 --> 20:48.830
<i>Ttoli is always whimpering
because she misses you.</i>

20:49.456 --> 20:52.125
<i>Bring your boyfriend.
I'll treat you to delicious food.</i>

20:52.209 --> 20:53.293
There's no boyfriend.

20:54.127 --> 20:56.630
<i>What? Did you break up?</i>

20:59.091 --> 21:00.259
<i>Na-bi.</i>

21:04.054 --> 21:06.473
Mom, I need to hang up.

21:24.491 --> 21:25.701
What?

21:54.855 --> 21:56.815
Why were you named after a butterfly?

21:58.775 --> 22:02.446
So my life could be sweet like honey.
My mom and aunt named me.

22:06.491 --> 22:07.576
I'm just kidding.

22:10.287 --> 22:12.247
Do you know Nathaniel Hawthorne?

22:13.582 --> 22:15.625
He's my aunt's favorite author,

22:16.543 --> 22:18.128
and he said this.

22:18.712 --> 22:20.630
It's a bit cringey to quote it.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.552
"Happiness is like a butterfly which,

22:27.346 --> 22:30.015
when pursued, is always beyond our grasp,

22:30.098 --> 22:34.311
but, if you will sit down quietly,
may alight upon you."

22:39.232 --> 22:40.901
That's the back story.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.821
It's nothing special.

22:44.905 --> 22:45.739
No…

22:47.032 --> 22:47.991
I love it.

23:07.928 --> 23:09.179
Is that a butterfly…

23:10.180 --> 23:11.264
on your neck?

23:11.348 --> 23:12.349
Yes.

23:15.477 --> 23:16.686
I like…

23:19.523 --> 23:20.482
butterflies.

23:32.536 --> 23:33.578
All done.

23:40.585 --> 23:41.837
It's cute.

23:43.755 --> 23:45.674
Is this really your wish?

23:46.883 --> 23:48.718
That was pretty simple.

23:51.805 --> 23:52.681
Then should I…

23:55.142 --> 23:56.226
make another wish?

24:13.201 --> 24:14.494
This is silly.

24:15.579 --> 24:16.413
What do you mean?

24:18.039 --> 24:18.957
It's nothing.

24:34.806 --> 24:36.391
The moon is pretty today.

24:45.358 --> 24:46.443
Do you want one?

24:49.654 --> 24:50.697
It's my last one.

24:51.281 --> 24:52.532
Well…

24:52.616 --> 24:54.409
I don't smoke.

24:57.245 --> 24:58.663
Excuse me.

24:58.747 --> 25:00.290
Can I borrow a cigarette?

25:02.834 --> 25:04.044
Gosh.

25:04.127 --> 25:06.171
I'm sobering up.

25:07.047 --> 25:10.383
Hey, can I borrow a cigarette?

25:11.259 --> 25:15.931
If we run into each other next time,
I promise to return the favor.

25:18.600 --> 25:19.726
I do have one, but…

25:35.033 --> 25:37.619
What the hell?

25:59.599 --> 26:00.684
What?

26:02.435 --> 26:03.478
Why are you smiling?

26:21.830 --> 26:22.872
Are you okay?

26:26.001 --> 26:27.210
Yes.

26:27.794 --> 26:29.045
I'm fine.

26:50.525 --> 26:52.235
Do you want to go see butterflies?

26:53.320 --> 26:55.322
Where would we see them?

26:57.490 --> 26:58.575
At my place.

27:07.292 --> 27:09.127
Let me go to the bathroom for a minute.

27:20.680 --> 27:21.639
What are you doing?

27:23.433 --> 27:24.768
I miss you too.

27:26.227 --> 27:27.479
Are you going to sleep?

27:32.233 --> 27:33.151
Yes.

27:36.613 --> 27:38.448
<i>What? So you just left?</i>

27:39.032 --> 27:40.784
Did you contact him after that?

27:40.867 --> 27:42.118
Of course not.

27:42.786 --> 27:45.914
I told him about where my name came from,
but I don't even know his name.

27:45.997 --> 27:48.333
You mustered up your courage, though.
Too bad.

27:51.461 --> 27:52.545
What's that?

27:54.297 --> 27:55.548
Oh, this?

27:55.632 --> 27:56.716
Well…

27:57.342 --> 27:58.593
It's nothing.

27:58.676 --> 27:59.803
It's love.

28:00.762 --> 28:03.348
It's nothing like that.

28:03.431 --> 28:05.016
-Then what is it?
-Lust?

28:05.100 --> 28:06.893
I don't know. It's just…

28:08.311 --> 28:09.479
It was fun.

28:09.562 --> 28:14.192
It's hard to find someone
you feel an instant connection with.

28:14.275 --> 28:16.444
Never mind that.
You said he has a girlfriend.

28:17.153 --> 28:19.739
You should never hang out with cheaters.

28:21.908 --> 28:24.577
Oh, right.
I have to post the part-time job ad.

28:24.661 --> 28:26.371
Or should I ask some of the kids?

28:26.454 --> 28:27.664
All right.

28:28.581 --> 28:29.999
How about Jae-eon?

28:30.083 --> 28:32.335
I'm not sure. Would he do it?

28:32.419 --> 28:35.588
I'll try to convince him.

28:39.217 --> 28:40.260
Hello.

28:40.343 --> 28:42.387
Oh, do, re, mi, fa, sol. Sol is here.

28:44.389 --> 28:46.057
I have a meeting with the professor.

28:46.141 --> 28:48.184
Right. Go inside with Na-bi.

28:51.896 --> 28:54.566
-Together?
-Together?

28:54.649 --> 28:57.610
It's okay. Sol can have the meeting first.

28:57.694 --> 28:59.362
It'll be a waste of time.

28:59.446 --> 29:01.197
It's about
the exchange student program, right?

29:01.948 --> 29:05.368
The professor's nagging will get longer
if it's one-on-one.

29:05.452 --> 29:06.494
Right.

29:07.162 --> 29:08.496
Right.

29:09.497 --> 29:10.331
Bye, then.

29:10.415 --> 29:11.374
Bye.

29:14.419 --> 29:16.045
You're really clueless, aren't you?

29:16.129 --> 29:17.756
What do you mean?

29:17.839 --> 29:21.718
Na-bi was feeling uncomfortable since
she didn't want to be compared to Sol.

29:21.801 --> 29:23.136
Is that so?

29:24.471 --> 29:26.306
You only picked hard places to get in.

29:27.515 --> 29:30.685
Na-bi, it'll be difficult to get
accepted to any of these schools.

29:30.769 --> 29:31.895
You know that, right?

29:34.814 --> 29:35.648
Yes.

29:35.732 --> 29:36.983
I'm not saying you're bad.

29:37.066 --> 29:38.651
You're doing well,

29:39.360 --> 29:41.404
but there are only
a limited number of spots.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.282
You have to raise your GPA.

29:44.365 --> 29:45.825
Work harder, okay?

29:46.743 --> 29:48.077
Yes, ma'am.

29:48.161 --> 29:51.539
And going abroad isn't always
the best answer.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.833
Staying in Korea could be a better option.

29:53.917 --> 29:56.920
Domestic graduate schools
are pretty good too.

29:57.003 --> 29:59.839
There's no place like Korea for Koreans,

29:59.923 --> 30:00.965
don't you think?

30:02.008 --> 30:04.177
Right.

30:04.260 --> 30:06.596
Let's talk again next time, then.

30:07.597 --> 30:09.057
What about you, Sol?

30:09.140 --> 30:11.059
You didn't submit your list?

30:11.142 --> 30:13.269
No, not yet.

30:13.353 --> 30:15.897
You could start next semester.
What are you waiting for?

30:15.980 --> 30:17.941
Is there something going on?

30:20.109 --> 30:21.444
No.

30:22.320 --> 30:24.405
I'll make my decision soon, ma'am.

30:25.448 --> 30:28.243
All right.
I'd prefer it if you made it quick.

30:28.910 --> 30:30.119
It's a waste of time.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.872
You might think it won't be any different.

30:32.956 --> 30:36.125
But there are things you can learn
from the world out there.

30:37.168 --> 30:38.545
This is a great list.

30:39.212 --> 30:42.298
Take a look at this,
and make your decision.

30:44.217 --> 30:45.927
LIST OF PROSPECTIVE UNIVERSITIES

30:46.010 --> 30:46.970
Yes, ma'am.

30:48.596 --> 30:51.975
Why do you two look so gloomy?

30:52.058 --> 30:54.185
You should be shining at that age.

30:54.269 --> 30:55.895
Don't stay holed up in the studio.

30:55.979 --> 30:58.356
You should make your life eventful

30:58.439 --> 31:01.609
to get inspiration for your work.
Got that?

31:02.777 --> 31:03.653
Yes.

31:04.821 --> 31:05.864
Yes.

31:10.201 --> 31:13.037
I think she said the word "inspiration"
over 100 times.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.333
Just take it.

31:17.417 --> 31:19.961
I was about to give you the file
if you needed it anyway.

31:21.004 --> 31:22.380
Thanks. It'll be helpful.

31:23.339 --> 31:25.508
It was so embarrassing, though.

31:26.175 --> 31:27.135
What was?

31:27.719 --> 31:31.055
I listed up all the great universities
without thinking about my grades.

31:31.764 --> 31:34.434
I'm jealous, Sol.
You can go pretty much anywhere.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.606
It might not be the best idea
to go abroad.

31:41.482 --> 31:44.235
Honestly, it kind of feels like
I'm just trying to run away.

31:45.028 --> 31:46.279
Were you thinking that too?

31:46.362 --> 31:48.114
Yun Sol!

31:51.117 --> 31:52.660
Oh, you were with Na-bi.

31:52.744 --> 31:55.330
What did the professor say?
Why did she call you two?

31:55.413 --> 31:56.623
It was for the exchange--

31:56.706 --> 31:59.083
Just talking about assignment ideas.

31:59.167 --> 32:00.293
Assignment ideas?

32:00.376 --> 32:03.880
Why did she leave me out?
This is favoritism.

32:03.963 --> 32:05.757
She just gave us a bit of advice.

32:06.633 --> 32:07.717
We'll be off.

32:08.384 --> 32:10.219
Oh, okay. Bye.

32:10.303 --> 32:11.262
Bye, Na-bi.

32:12.764 --> 32:15.892
I'm the one who's out of ideas.

32:25.318 --> 32:26.736
Why are you dressed so nicely?

32:26.819 --> 32:29.072
Do I look nice? That's a relief.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.866
Is it because we're gathering today?

32:31.950 --> 32:33.159
Well…

32:33.242 --> 32:35.703
my blind date was supposed to be tomorrow,

32:35.787 --> 32:38.414
but he said something urgent came up

32:38.498 --> 32:40.208
and asked if we could meet today.

32:40.291 --> 32:42.168
Otherwise, it'll be a while later.

32:42.251 --> 32:45.129
You know how you shouldn't
put off a blind date for too long.

32:45.213 --> 32:47.131
So I just agreed to meet him today.

32:47.215 --> 32:49.884
What? Then what about our gathering today?

32:49.968 --> 32:51.386
Tell the others for me.

32:51.469 --> 32:54.430
Hey, I didn't want to go.
You're the one who made a fuss.

32:54.514 --> 32:56.683
I know. I'm really sorry.

32:56.766 --> 32:58.768
But if you don't go either,

32:58.851 --> 33:02.188
everyone will curse me to death. Please?

33:02.271 --> 33:03.856
-Sol, please.
-Gosh.

33:03.940 --> 33:05.149
All right.

33:05.233 --> 33:06.067
I love you!

33:06.150 --> 33:09.237
If things go well with my date,
I'll set you up with someone too.

33:09.320 --> 33:10.279
There's no need.

33:10.363 --> 33:11.698
Oh, come on.

33:46.524 --> 33:48.484
-Hi. What brings you here?
-Hello.

33:48.568 --> 33:50.319
-Hello.
-Hello.

33:51.237 --> 33:53.031
-Keep working.
-Okay.

33:56.159 --> 33:57.660
I already chiseled it off.

34:40.870 --> 34:42.830
<i>You have to raise your GPA.</i>

34:55.301 --> 34:58.137
So you're really going to stay up working?

34:58.679 --> 34:59.555
Yes.

35:00.598 --> 35:02.517
Or I might not be able to finish on time.

35:02.600 --> 35:03.976
My progress is slow.

35:04.060 --> 35:06.437
Alcohol is the best when you're stuck.

35:06.979 --> 35:08.648
I'm going to go drink with the kids.

35:10.066 --> 35:11.818
You don't know any of our juniors.

35:11.901 --> 35:14.112
Don't you need an assistant
for the exhibit?

35:14.862 --> 35:19.367
At this rate, you'll be the first one
in our department to do everything alone.

35:24.163 --> 35:26.124
Gosh. Never mind.

35:26.707 --> 35:28.376
There's no way
you'll get a new boyfriend like that.

35:28.459 --> 35:29.627
Bye.

35:32.547 --> 35:34.132
Call me if you change your mind.

35:35.258 --> 35:36.259
Okay.

35:37.552 --> 35:38.845
Have fun!

35:38.928 --> 35:40.012
I will!

36:25.975 --> 36:27.685
That will be 14,000 won.

36:27.768 --> 36:28.769
Here.

36:36.777 --> 36:37.820
<i>It's him.</i>

36:39.322 --> 36:40.281
Hang on.

36:53.085 --> 36:54.503
<i>The library, and now this.</i>

36:56.172 --> 36:57.882
<i>I must be losing my mind.</i>

37:03.554 --> 37:04.764
<i>You're really not coming?</i>

37:11.938 --> 37:13.648
Bit-na, where's the location?

37:33.459 --> 37:34.669
We meet again.

37:38.422 --> 37:41.550
What are you doing here?

37:45.805 --> 37:46.639
Hey, you're here.

37:46.722 --> 37:49.267
-Hi. I'm heading in first.
-Okay.

37:55.189 --> 37:56.107
He's the junior…

37:57.191 --> 37:58.734
who was hoping to drink with you.

38:02.697 --> 38:03.823
I see.

38:04.615 --> 38:06.367
Look! You're screwed.

38:09.203 --> 38:11.580
Gosh, this place is flooded with seniors.

38:12.164 --> 38:13.040
Seniors!

38:13.124 --> 38:15.584
Are you sick of your seniors?

38:15.668 --> 38:16.627
Not at all!

38:19.380 --> 38:20.923
But we have a newbie now.

38:22.341 --> 38:24.802
She made a rare appearance,
so be nice to her.

38:27.596 --> 38:30.099
This is Yu Na-bi,
and this is Park Jae-eon.

38:31.767 --> 38:32.893
<i>Park Jae-eon…</i>

38:33.477 --> 38:34.312
Oh, okay.

38:34.395 --> 38:37.398
<i>His name was Park Jae-eon.</i>

38:39.275 --> 38:40.568
What's with the face?

38:42.862 --> 38:43.946
Do you know each other?

38:46.032 --> 38:47.158
No.

38:47.658 --> 38:50.494
-It's our first time seeing each other.
-It's your first time?

38:50.578 --> 38:51.996
They took turns taking a leave.

38:52.079 --> 38:55.458
And Na-bi barely attends school events.

38:55.541 --> 38:59.128
-That's right. She never shows up.
-But you come to all of them.

38:59.211 --> 39:00.629
Hi.

39:05.885 --> 39:07.470
Oh. Hi.

39:07.553 --> 39:10.056
I just got butterflies in my stomach!

39:10.139 --> 39:11.599
"Oh. Hi."

39:11.682 --> 39:12.808
I'm getting butterflies!

39:12.892 --> 39:15.728
I'm Park Jae-eon.
I'll just talk to you casually.

39:15.811 --> 39:17.271
He's the same age as us.

39:17.355 --> 39:19.273
He was a business major at K University

39:19.357 --> 39:21.692
but he took the entrance exam again
to major in sculpture.

39:21.776 --> 39:22.818
I see.

39:22.902 --> 39:25.029
I saw you before, though.

39:26.655 --> 39:27.490
What?

39:32.495 --> 39:34.288
Where?

39:36.040 --> 39:36.916
At school.

39:41.253 --> 39:42.922
I said I wanted to drink with you.

39:43.005 --> 39:43.881
Right.

39:44.924 --> 39:46.801
So you two have finally met.

39:48.302 --> 39:49.470
It's nice to meet you.

39:51.222 --> 39:52.848
It's nice to meet you too.

39:54.308 --> 39:56.727
<i>I don't believe…</i>

39:56.811 --> 39:59.230
<i>in fate or love anymore.</i>

40:01.941 --> 40:04.110
<i>But this situation…</i>

40:06.195 --> 40:07.363
<i>It's pretty unrealistic.</i>

40:09.156 --> 40:12.368
That professor gives us
so many assignments. It's awful.

40:12.451 --> 40:14.370
You selected a bad course.

40:14.453 --> 40:16.247
You took that class.
Why didn't you tell me?

40:16.330 --> 40:18.666
-Ji-wan's still not answering?
-No.

40:19.333 --> 40:22.503
She's not reading my messages.
I guess she's still with him.

40:22.586 --> 40:25.381
She said she'd make it quick.
Things must be going well.

40:25.464 --> 40:27.425
Hey, that's a given.

40:27.508 --> 40:29.885
Ji-wan's popular with guys.

40:29.969 --> 40:31.637
I'm so jealous.

40:31.720 --> 40:34.807
So many guys asked for her number
at our high school festival.

40:34.890 --> 40:38.018
But it seems like Ji-wan
likes the guy this time, too.

40:38.102 --> 40:41.188
There's no point.
Bet she'll get sick of him within a month.

40:41.272 --> 40:42.440
Right.

40:42.523 --> 40:46.485
It's her biggest wish to go on a
couple's trip for a one-year anniversary.

40:46.569 --> 40:48.654
-That's so cute.
-It's cute.

40:52.491 --> 40:55.119
-I'll get it.
-It'll be hard to carry it all yourself.

40:55.202 --> 40:57.413
No, it's fine.

40:57.496 --> 40:58.497
Keep talking.

40:58.998 --> 41:00.583
Right, so what happened?

41:00.666 --> 41:01.876
He has a girlfriend.

41:16.807 --> 41:17.683
Oh, my gosh.

41:20.895 --> 41:22.021
I'm so sorry.

41:22.104 --> 41:22.980
I'm okay.

41:23.647 --> 41:24.565
Are you all right?

41:24.648 --> 41:25.566
Yes.

41:26.484 --> 41:27.985
I was looking at my phone.

41:28.819 --> 41:29.778
I'm okay.

41:30.571 --> 41:34.366
-Exciting! So much fun! The Game of Death!
-Exciting! So much fun! The Game of Death!

41:34.450 --> 41:35.284
Three! One!

41:35.367 --> 41:36.368
-Two!
-Three!

41:38.537 --> 41:39.747
Take off your hat.

41:39.830 --> 41:42.333
-Hey. Here's a hair tie.
-Take it off.

41:42.416 --> 41:44.001
Make a palm tree.

41:44.084 --> 41:47.254
Go easy on me, please.

41:47.338 --> 41:49.924
<i>Jae-eon is fun.</i>

41:50.007 --> 41:51.800
You look pretty.

41:51.884 --> 41:52.760
Jae-eon!

41:52.843 --> 41:53.844
I'm sorry.

41:54.845 --> 41:55.846
Off you go.

41:55.930 --> 41:57.473
That look really suits you!

42:05.773 --> 42:07.983
I'm really sorry, but…

42:08.067 --> 42:09.568
Oh, you want a glass?

42:09.652 --> 42:10.903
No…

42:11.779 --> 42:13.113
If it's okay with you…

42:14.907 --> 42:17.243
Could you watch me dance?

42:17.326 --> 42:19.495
Don't cover your face!

42:19.578 --> 42:21.622
-Five, six, seven, eight!
-<i>Jae-eon has a way of</i>

42:21.705 --> 42:24.291
<i>making naughty pranks seem rather fun.</i>

42:27.836 --> 42:29.046
Twist your body!

42:29.797 --> 42:30.965
What is that?

42:37.513 --> 42:38.597
Come on!

42:40.724 --> 42:41.600
This is so stupid.

42:41.684 --> 42:43.269
Are you upset?

42:43.352 --> 42:44.562
I guess he smiles a lot.

42:44.645 --> 42:46.188
-Let's play another game.
-What?

42:46.272 --> 42:47.439
-Let's drink.
-What?

42:47.523 --> 42:49.942
-It's nothing.
-Come on. Drink up.

42:50.943 --> 42:52.444
It's mine.

42:52.528 --> 42:54.863
Come on. Cheers!

42:54.947 --> 42:57.283
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

42:57.366 --> 42:59.285
Can you hand me that?

43:02.746 --> 43:03.831
Thanks.

43:09.962 --> 43:12.298
-Hey, guys. Gather round.
-What is it?

43:12.381 --> 43:15.968
Who are the scumbags who did it
in the student council room last semester?

43:17.553 --> 43:20.681
Then is it true that a condom was found
in the trash can?

43:20.764 --> 43:22.391
That's disgusting!

43:22.474 --> 43:23.851
The sofa…

43:26.186 --> 43:27.187
On the sofa?

43:27.271 --> 43:30.858
You better fess up. Could it have been…

43:34.612 --> 43:37.156
Quit playing detective.
You're barking up the wrong tree.

43:37.239 --> 43:38.073
What?

43:38.157 --> 43:39.366
Do you know who it is?

43:39.450 --> 43:41.035
-Who is it?
-Get off me.

43:41.118 --> 43:42.369
-Who is it?
-Who is it?

43:42.453 --> 43:43.746
Goodness.

43:43.829 --> 43:45.456
Do you still not know?

43:46.957 --> 43:47.833
It's Choi Min-u.

43:47.916 --> 43:48.792
No way!

43:48.876 --> 43:51.337
-His girlfriend is Jeong-a.
-Then it was her and Min-u?

43:51.420 --> 43:54.006
Of course not. He was sleeping
with someone else.

43:56.216 --> 43:57.551
He was cheating on her?

43:57.635 --> 43:59.219
That asshole!

43:59.303 --> 44:00.971
How could he do that to her?

44:01.055 --> 44:02.389
I feel sorry for her.

44:02.473 --> 44:06.727
There are quite some pretty girls
who have poor judgment.

44:07.311 --> 44:10.147
No wonder you're called Bit-na News.
Go, Bit-na News!

44:10.230 --> 44:11.231
Stop overreacting.

44:11.315 --> 44:12.358
Let me pour you a shot.

44:12.441 --> 44:14.652
-Oh, thank you.
-This is boring, isn't it?

44:14.735 --> 44:15.861
-Is your source reliable?
-Should we leave?

44:15.944 --> 44:18.155
-Don't be ridiculous.
-Stay out of it.

44:18.238 --> 44:20.032
-More drinks!
-Whose glass is empty?

44:20.115 --> 44:22.076
-Me!
-You should take a break.

44:22.159 --> 44:23.452
-Here you go.
-Thank you, my dear.

44:23.535 --> 44:25.412
-You're the best.
-So how did you find out?

44:26.538 --> 44:28.290
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

44:29.124 --> 44:29.958
You dropped this.

44:30.042 --> 44:32.211
Oh. Thank you.

44:36.006 --> 44:37.049
Look at him.

44:42.096 --> 44:44.223
You look a bit different when you smile.

44:51.313 --> 44:53.065
I'm going to the bathroom for a bit.

44:53.148 --> 44:54.066
Okay.

45:06.286 --> 45:08.455
Why do I feel so annoyed?

45:13.836 --> 45:16.338
I should just get back to work.

45:28.976 --> 45:30.477
I'm going to go buy ice cream.

45:31.145 --> 45:32.563
Do you want to come with me?

45:40.571 --> 45:41.613
What do you want?

45:43.365 --> 45:44.491
That one?

45:44.575 --> 45:45.617
No.

45:47.035 --> 45:47.870
Then…

45:47.953 --> 45:49.538
what about that one?

45:51.999 --> 45:53.083
No.

45:54.501 --> 45:55.711
This one.

46:02.593 --> 46:03.635
Why did you laugh?

46:07.222 --> 46:08.474
Because you're cute.

46:11.351 --> 46:12.352
Shut up.

46:17.566 --> 46:18.942
Your style looks different.

46:21.195 --> 46:22.613
Hey, what are you doing?

46:22.696 --> 46:24.531
Let's skip study hall and go play games.

46:26.033 --> 46:27.075
Sorry!

46:31.914 --> 46:33.540
Why did you say you didn't know me?

46:35.459 --> 46:36.627
Well…

46:37.878 --> 46:40.172
I was caught off-guard.

46:42.841 --> 46:45.761
It would've been strange to say
that I knew you.

46:46.720 --> 46:48.889
I didn't know your name or your age.

46:51.934 --> 46:53.769
So why did you just leave that day?

46:58.398 --> 47:00.526
I was drunk.

47:03.695 --> 47:06.448
Anyway, the stuff I said that day…

47:08.075 --> 47:09.284
Just forget everything.

47:10.118 --> 47:11.078
What about that day?

47:11.578 --> 47:13.163
You didn't say much.

47:15.249 --> 47:16.124
Well…

47:16.875 --> 47:18.210
Just forget about it.

47:19.294 --> 47:21.505
Don't worry. I won't say anything.

47:24.675 --> 47:26.051
Okay.

47:30.055 --> 47:31.265
You didn't erase it.

47:34.726 --> 47:35.686
Oh, this?

47:39.273 --> 47:41.275
Right.

47:41.358 --> 47:43.402
I washed it, but it wouldn't come off.

47:44.486 --> 47:45.529
That's strange.

47:47.281 --> 47:48.907
It was a water-based marker.

47:52.995 --> 47:54.121
Oh, really?

47:56.540 --> 47:57.416
That's strange.

48:02.629 --> 48:04.423
Didn't you want to see me again?

48:08.218 --> 48:09.219
Well…

48:11.763 --> 48:12.598
Not much.

48:12.681 --> 48:14.349
But I was pretty startled.

48:14.933 --> 48:16.643
I thought I'd never see you again.

48:19.104 --> 48:20.230
I was glad…

48:21.940 --> 48:23.317
to see you again.

48:49.384 --> 48:51.803
Why are you two coming in together?

48:52.638 --> 48:53.972
We bought ice cream.

49:01.063 --> 49:03.982
Love always begins with ice cream,
you know.

49:05.150 --> 49:06.109
Come here!

49:08.236 --> 49:09.780
Hey! Let's go for a smoke.

49:09.863 --> 49:10.739
Okay.

49:11.323 --> 49:12.449
Do you want to come?

49:12.532 --> 49:13.533
She doesn't smoke.

49:15.535 --> 49:16.370
Really?

49:16.453 --> 49:17.996
Be careful on the way out.

49:31.134 --> 49:32.803
Darn it…

49:39.518 --> 49:41.770
Here. This is my number.

49:41.853 --> 49:45.273
If you text me your bank account number
and the cost, I'll send the money.

49:45.857 --> 49:47.234
All right. I'll keep in touch.

49:49.736 --> 49:51.405
I'm really sorry.

49:51.488 --> 49:52.406
It's fine.

49:54.324 --> 49:56.118
Your head's a bit red. Are you okay?

49:57.703 --> 50:00.580
It's okay. My head is rock-hard.

50:00.664 --> 50:03.583
Are you not hurt?
I ran into you pretty hard.

50:03.667 --> 50:05.210
I'm okay.

50:05.293 --> 50:07.170
That's a relief, then.

50:07.671 --> 50:08.839
Let's go.

50:11.258 --> 50:14.344
Why don't we just go
for another round somewhere?

50:14.428 --> 50:16.722
Hello? Everyone here?

50:18.974 --> 50:20.267
Hey, let's go.

50:20.350 --> 50:22.269
Let's do that. All right.

50:24.479 --> 50:25.856
-I'm off.
-Let's go together.

50:25.939 --> 50:27.607
-Let's go.
-We're leaving.

50:27.691 --> 50:28.900
-Goodbye!
-Good night!

50:28.984 --> 50:30.360
Be careful on the way home.

50:32.487 --> 50:35.157
You seemed to have drunk a lot.
Are you all right?

50:35.240 --> 50:37.534
Yes, I'm fine. I'm not even drunk.

50:39.077 --> 50:39.911
What about you?

50:43.707 --> 50:44.833
Is that your girlfriend?

50:44.916 --> 50:46.376
What?

50:48.003 --> 50:49.379
I don't have a girlfriend.

50:49.463 --> 50:51.757
I'm taking the bus here.
Careful on the way home.

50:52.340 --> 50:53.967
Right. Bye.

51:20.118 --> 51:21.411
We meet again.

51:21.495 --> 51:22.704
I like…

51:25.457 --> 51:26.291
butterflies.

51:26.374 --> 51:27.626
I was glad…

51:29.377 --> 51:30.712
to see you again.

51:31.963 --> 51:33.465
I don't have a girlfriend.

51:36.551 --> 51:37.928
Is this fate?

51:53.193 --> 51:54.319
OH BIT-NA

51:54.402 --> 51:56.905
<i>Guys, send 20,000 won each for the drinks.</i>

51:59.950 --> 52:01.785
PARK JAE-EON

52:45.996 --> 52:47.289
Why are you awake?

52:49.875 --> 52:50.750
Right now?

52:52.168 --> 52:53.587
Is it okay for me to come over?

53:10.145 --> 53:12.647
I SENT THE MONEY
I SENT THE MONEY TOO

53:13.940 --> 53:15.275
Is he sleeping?

53:20.405 --> 53:21.698
He's sleeping already?

53:27.913 --> 53:29.664
What am I doing?

53:54.022 --> 53:55.523
<i>Are you sleeping?</i>

53:55.607 --> 53:58.526
Darn it. Not you.

54:14.042 --> 54:15.085
SCULPTURE STUDIO 3

54:22.425 --> 54:23.927
Hey, Sol.

54:24.761 --> 54:25.679
Aren't you going for a smoke?

54:25.762 --> 54:27.430
I already did.

54:27.514 --> 54:28.390
I see.

54:31.476 --> 54:33.436
Hey, guys.
Aren't you going out for a smoke?

54:33.520 --> 54:35.522
Just go. I'm totally busy right now.

54:35.605 --> 54:36.731
Go away.

54:38.024 --> 54:39.234
What about you?

54:39.317 --> 54:41.027
No. This isn't sticking.

54:43.989 --> 54:46.157
-You're really not going?
-Just go.

54:56.167 --> 54:57.085
Hi.

54:57.168 --> 54:58.503
Hi, Na-bi.

55:00.422 --> 55:01.256
Hey, Na-bi.

55:01.339 --> 55:02.632
Oh, hi.

55:08.722 --> 55:09.556
What is it, Na-bi?

55:09.639 --> 55:11.057
What?

55:11.141 --> 55:13.643
It's nothing.

55:14.436 --> 55:16.396
-I thought it was due today.
-I have to work late.

55:20.275 --> 55:21.234
-Na-bi.
-Hey.

55:21.317 --> 55:22.944
-Are you looking for someone?
-No.

55:23.653 --> 55:25.113
I'm just getting some fresh air.

55:30.118 --> 55:32.328
Professor!

55:32.412 --> 55:34.122
-Professor!
-Professor!

55:34.205 --> 55:36.916
Hey, a five-year-old
would do a better job.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.668
Professor!

55:38.752 --> 55:41.087
Professor, can you help me?

55:42.464 --> 55:44.716
Gyeong-jun! Please!

55:46.551 --> 55:49.637
No matter how many colors I mix,
I can't get the right color.

55:49.721 --> 55:51.598
I won't help you
unless you call me Mr. An.

55:52.098 --> 55:53.600
But you're our senior.

55:53.683 --> 55:56.478
I will be so grateful
if you could help me with this.

55:56.561 --> 55:57.645
-No.
-Mr. An!

55:58.772 --> 56:00.065
See? He calls me Mr. An.

56:00.148 --> 56:01.900
-Gyeong-jun! Mr. An!
-I need your help.

56:05.236 --> 56:08.865
-What should I do?
-Just apply the second layer

56:08.948 --> 56:11.451
and coat it with primer in the end. Okay?

56:12.202 --> 56:13.411
PARK JAE-EON

56:16.039 --> 56:18.041
He's in the group chat room, though.

56:18.917 --> 56:20.919
PARK JAE-EON

56:24.130 --> 56:25.423
Mr. An!

56:25.507 --> 56:26.800
What are you doing?

56:26.883 --> 56:28.885
-Gyeong-jun! I mean, Mr. An!
-Hello, ma'am.

56:28.968 --> 56:30.887
-Why were you startled?
-Mr. An, please.

56:30.970 --> 56:32.722
I'm more startled at your piece.

56:32.806 --> 56:34.057
Why is there no progress?

56:34.140 --> 56:36.351
-I can't seem to get the color right.
-Well, I…

56:36.434 --> 56:38.019
I'm almost done.

56:38.103 --> 56:40.730
This shouldn't be "almost done." Okay?

56:42.982 --> 56:43.983
I'll work late today.

56:44.067 --> 56:45.527
Working late isn't going to…

56:49.864 --> 56:51.908
-Let's talk later.
-Yes, ma'am.

57:03.294 --> 57:04.629
-Hey, Bit-na.
-What?

57:04.712 --> 57:06.673
Did everyone send the money last night?

57:06.756 --> 57:08.383
What? Yes, everyone sent it.

57:08.466 --> 57:09.467
Why?

57:09.551 --> 57:10.927
I was just curious.

57:11.010 --> 57:12.220
They all sent it.

57:16.808 --> 57:18.810
Jae-eon gave it to me in cash right away.

57:21.396 --> 57:22.230
Oh.

57:25.525 --> 57:26.734
Keep going.

57:28.236 --> 57:29.237
Focus, all right?

57:29.320 --> 57:30.572
I am.

57:36.619 --> 57:39.372
I'm so full.
My stomach's going to explode.

57:39.456 --> 57:40.707
Mine first.

57:40.790 --> 57:41.958
I can't breathe.

57:42.625 --> 57:44.169
But I can still eat dessert.

57:44.252 --> 57:45.795
I can totally eat cake.

57:45.879 --> 57:46.880
I can eat cake too!

57:46.963 --> 57:48.965
I can eat it with coffee!

57:50.216 --> 57:51.801
We have some time left. Shall we?

57:51.885 --> 57:54.762
-Sure, you little foodie.
-You guys are coming too, right?

57:54.846 --> 57:55.680
Of course.

57:56.222 --> 57:59.142
Your stomachs are really going to explode.

57:59.225 --> 58:02.061
He always picks a fight
when he's going to join us anyway.

58:02.145 --> 58:02.979
Tell me about it.

58:03.062 --> 58:03.980
Oh, no.

58:04.063 --> 58:05.648
Where are my Bluetooth earphones?

58:08.276 --> 58:09.903
I left them at the outdoor studio.

58:10.403 --> 58:12.197
Someone's going to steal them for sure.

58:12.697 --> 58:16.534
There are security cameras everywhere.
Nobody will take them.

58:16.618 --> 58:17.785
Right?

58:17.869 --> 58:19.329
It's so far away.

58:19.412 --> 58:21.456
-I'll just ask in our chat room.
-Wait. I'll get them.

58:22.123 --> 58:22.957
Really?

58:23.041 --> 58:24.292
Yes.

58:24.375 --> 58:26.419
It's fine. You don't need to.

58:26.503 --> 58:29.005
No, I was about to go back anyway.

58:29.088 --> 58:31.299
I'll get them and put them in your locker.

58:31.382 --> 58:32.592
Send me your passcode.

58:32.675 --> 58:34.052
I'm so touched.

58:34.135 --> 58:35.011
Thank you.

58:35.094 --> 58:36.387
It's nothing.

58:37.639 --> 58:38.932
She's so kind.

58:40.934 --> 58:41.893
What should I do?

58:42.560 --> 58:45.021
I'm so popular.

58:45.104 --> 58:47.607
Dream on. She'd never fall for you.

58:48.107 --> 58:51.194
I was just saying!
Why would she do that for me?

58:51.277 --> 58:53.905
She was going to head back anyway.

58:53.988 --> 58:55.657
Never mind. Let's go have some cake.

58:55.740 --> 58:57.033
Yes!

59:05.416 --> 59:07.961
What's this? Is it a bat?

59:09.087 --> 59:11.047
A bat? It's a butterfly.

59:12.423 --> 59:15.385
This piece sure feels different
from all the other ones.

59:15.468 --> 59:16.719
Right.

59:16.803 --> 59:20.265
I don't even see him often at the studio.
When did he do all this?

59:20.848 --> 59:22.141
He must be a genius.

59:22.225 --> 59:24.978
Jae-eon won almost
all the competitions last year.

59:25.478 --> 59:28.064
And he's even handsome.
Life's so unfair, isn't it?

59:29.482 --> 59:30.900
So that was Jae-eon's.

59:31.526 --> 59:33.152
But where did Jae-eon…

59:33.236 --> 59:34.696
Oh. Hi, Na-bi.

59:35.488 --> 59:36.406
Hi.

59:36.489 --> 59:37.740
What brings you here?

59:38.366 --> 59:39.701
Well…

59:39.784 --> 59:42.328
Jin-su said he left something behind.

59:42.412 --> 59:44.414
Did you see Bluetooth earphones
lying around?

59:44.497 --> 59:45.748
-No.
-No.

59:45.832 --> 59:47.292
You should look around.

59:47.375 --> 59:48.251
Okay, I will.

59:54.465 --> 59:55.675
Oh, Jae-eon!

59:57.051 --> 59:57.885
Hey, Jae-eon.

59:57.969 --> 59:58.928
Hey.

59:59.012 --> 59:59.929
Hi, Jae-eon.

1:00:03.725 --> 1:00:04.809
Hi.

1:00:05.643 --> 1:00:06.644
Hi.

1:00:07.437 --> 1:00:08.438
Looking for something?

1:00:09.564 --> 1:00:10.481
No.

1:00:13.985 --> 1:00:15.653
Jae-eon, that's a butterfly, right?

1:00:15.737 --> 1:00:17.488
She said it looks like a bat.

1:00:18.239 --> 1:00:20.950
You recognized it?
Everyone thinks it's a bat.

1:00:21.034 --> 1:00:22.702
You must really like butterflies.

1:00:22.785 --> 1:00:25.580
-Your last piece was one too.
-Do you want to see my butterflies?

1:00:25.663 --> 1:00:26.581
Yes. Show us.

1:00:26.664 --> 1:00:27.790
Yes, please.

1:00:31.252 --> 1:00:32.837
They're so pretty.

1:00:34.130 --> 1:00:37.508
Is that what your tattoo is about?
Like people get tattoos of their pets?

1:00:42.764 --> 1:00:44.015
Do they have names?

1:00:45.058 --> 1:00:46.684
No, I just call them butterflies.

1:00:49.687 --> 1:00:50.605
"Butterfly."

1:00:53.566 --> 1:00:54.734
It's a pretty name.

1:01:14.712 --> 1:01:15.546
I like…

1:01:18.049 --> 1:01:19.175
butterflies.

1:01:20.510 --> 1:01:21.469
"Butterfly."

1:01:22.095 --> 1:01:23.054
It's a pretty name.

1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:25.682
<i>Jae-eon keeps making me think</i>

1:01:25.765 --> 1:01:28.267
<i>the way my annoying ex did.</i>

1:01:28.351 --> 1:01:31.938
It's so stupid to read too much into
meaningless stuff.

1:01:35.024 --> 1:01:37.527
You idiot.

1:01:38.236 --> 1:01:39.529
Who's an idiot?

1:01:43.241 --> 1:01:44.200
Don't look.

1:01:45.118 --> 1:01:47.995
Is this seaweed?

1:01:50.373 --> 1:01:54.460
Why did you have to appear out of nowhere
and surprise me like that?

1:01:54.544 --> 1:01:56.129
You're just insensitive.

1:01:56.671 --> 1:01:59.716
You left without a word.
I thought you had something to say.

1:02:02.719 --> 1:02:04.345
No, I didn't have anything…

1:02:05.263 --> 1:02:07.765
I was just looking
for my friend's belongings.

1:02:11.477 --> 1:02:13.521
<i>You know how popular you are, right?</i>

1:02:15.606 --> 1:02:18.401
<i>That's why you have that look
and talk that way.</i>

1:02:22.822 --> 1:02:23.865
What?

1:02:25.032 --> 1:02:26.492
There's the seaweed.

1:02:27.201 --> 1:02:28.661
-Come here.
-Sorry.

1:02:28.745 --> 1:02:30.747
I'm sorry! Stop it.

1:02:30.830 --> 1:02:32.915
-Wipe it off.
-Okay, I will.

1:02:32.999 --> 1:02:34.292
I'll wipe it off for you.

1:02:39.338 --> 1:02:41.758
-Sorry! Okay, I'll really wipe it off.
-Hang on.

1:02:41.841 --> 1:02:43.342
-You'd better.
-What?

1:02:43.426 --> 1:02:45.219
-Come on, wipe it off.
-When did they get so close?

1:02:45.303 --> 1:02:47.638
They look pretty good together. Hey!

1:02:47.722 --> 1:02:48.973
What?

1:02:49.056 --> 1:02:50.141
Let's just go.

1:02:50.224 --> 1:02:51.517
-Why?
-Come on. Let's go.

1:04:20.940 --> 1:04:24.360
Why do my shoulders hurt so much?
I wish they had high bars at school.

1:04:31.868 --> 1:04:32.702
Relax.

1:04:34.328 --> 1:04:36.289
Your back was hunched
when you were working.

1:04:36.372 --> 1:04:39.125
Hey, let go. Wait.

1:04:39.208 --> 1:04:41.127
Wait. Stop.

1:04:53.431 --> 1:04:55.308
I almost fell down.

1:05:06.861 --> 1:05:09.280
Bit-na says
you practically live in the studio.

1:05:09.864 --> 1:05:11.699
Not really.

1:05:12.617 --> 1:05:14.368
I like working at night,

1:05:14.452 --> 1:05:16.746
so I often stay late. What about you?

1:05:17.246 --> 1:05:18.664
I might try it more often.

1:05:19.248 --> 1:05:20.166
It was fun.

1:05:21.709 --> 1:05:23.669
<i>As we talk,</i>

1:05:23.753 --> 1:05:25.671
<i>I can see different sides of Jae-eon.</i>

1:05:28.049 --> 1:05:29.300
I envy you.

1:05:30.301 --> 1:05:32.845
It used to be fun for me a long time ago.

1:05:34.180 --> 1:05:35.556
It's not fun anymore?

1:05:36.223 --> 1:05:38.976
There's a lot to think about now.

1:05:40.561 --> 1:05:42.605
And I'm not sure what to do.

1:05:42.688 --> 1:05:44.357
You wanted to be an exchange student.

1:05:45.358 --> 1:05:46.692
It seems like a good goal.

1:05:47.276 --> 1:05:48.569
It's nothing.

1:05:50.529 --> 1:05:53.574
It sounds special,
but lots of students do it.

1:05:57.578 --> 1:05:58.579
And honestly…

1:06:02.124 --> 1:06:04.210
I just want to go somewhere far away.

1:06:05.795 --> 1:06:06.629
Why?

1:06:08.130 --> 1:06:10.049
Because of my mom and…

1:06:11.509 --> 1:06:13.302
Let's stop talking about this.

1:06:13.886 --> 1:06:14.804
It's boring.

1:06:16.597 --> 1:06:17.723
It's not boring to me.

1:06:19.308 --> 1:06:20.977
You're talking about your true self.

1:06:22.853 --> 1:06:25.272
<i>He's different from
the first impression I had of him.</i>

1:06:26.399 --> 1:06:29.068
<i>I wanted to believe
that only I knew this side of him.</i>

1:06:37.743 --> 1:06:39.370
There's the moon you like.

1:06:46.752 --> 1:06:47.753
It's pretty.

1:06:50.965 --> 1:06:52.049
It's pretty.

1:07:02.935 --> 1:07:03.811
Your number.

1:07:09.150 --> 1:07:10.693
Oh. My number?

1:07:14.447 --> 1:07:16.657
<i>It feels like something new
is about to begin.</i>

1:07:17.783 --> 1:07:19.035
<i>I'm probably not mistaken.</i>

1:07:24.790 --> 1:07:27.418
Yu Na-bi. I saved your number.

1:07:29.170 --> 1:07:31.380
<i>You know that I'm Na-bi.</i>

1:07:37.219 --> 1:07:38.262
Do you want one?

1:07:39.138 --> 1:07:40.306
No, thanks.

1:07:44.393 --> 1:07:45.686
Did you get it customized?

1:07:46.854 --> 1:07:47.688
Yes.

1:07:48.814 --> 1:07:49.690
Isn't it pretty?

1:07:51.942 --> 1:07:53.444
Another butterfly.

1:07:54.320 --> 1:07:55.738
Oh, show me too.

1:07:56.489 --> 1:07:58.824
-What?
-Your pet butterflies.

1:08:00.159 --> 1:08:02.244
-Oh, my butterflies?
-Yes.

1:08:02.912 --> 1:08:04.038
Want to go see them?

1:08:08.417 --> 1:08:11.629
I mean, I want to see the video

1:08:11.712 --> 1:08:14.131
that you showed your friends. Gosh.

1:08:29.271 --> 1:08:30.564
They're pretty.

1:08:34.151 --> 1:08:35.820
What do you like so much about them?

1:08:42.576 --> 1:08:46.539
They sometimes crawl up
onto my face like this.

1:08:47.915 --> 1:08:49.250
It feels really nice.

1:08:55.172 --> 1:08:56.298
It's lovely.

1:09:01.470 --> 1:09:02.847
That tickles.

1:09:07.059 --> 1:09:09.228
I want to smoke, too.

1:09:14.859 --> 1:09:16.360
I don't want to go back inside.

1:09:21.157 --> 1:09:22.116
Me neither.

1:09:27.454 --> 1:09:28.831
You don't smoke, though.

1:09:29.707 --> 1:09:31.083
Do you want to go have drinks?

1:09:31.167 --> 1:09:32.209
Drinks?

1:09:35.045 --> 1:09:36.881
Are you going to work some more? Then…

1:09:36.964 --> 1:09:39.008
No. Let's go.

1:09:39.925 --> 1:09:41.010
Just the two of us?

1:09:44.597 --> 1:09:46.056
Well…

1:09:46.140 --> 1:09:47.933
we can call our friends.

1:09:48.934 --> 1:09:50.186
Should I call them?

1:09:50.769 --> 1:09:51.729
Why are you laughing?

1:09:51.812 --> 1:09:53.022
I don't know.

1:09:54.064 --> 1:09:55.357
You make me laugh.

1:09:58.152 --> 1:10:00.029
Are you that happy to drink with me?

1:10:00.112 --> 1:10:01.113
I am.

1:10:13.542 --> 1:10:14.376
<i>I'm sure…</i>

1:10:15.878 --> 1:10:17.504
<i>that we feel the same way.</i>

1:11:14.812 --> 1:11:16.146
<i>I'm using my wish.</i>

1:11:16.230 --> 1:11:18.857
<i>I'm sure he does this to everyone.
I know everything.</i>

1:11:18.941 --> 1:11:21.485
<i>Park Jae-eon?
He has no interest at all in dating.</i>

1:11:21.568 --> 1:11:22.695
<i>So forget him.</i>

1:11:23.320 --> 1:11:24.363
-<i>Hey!</i>
-<i>Are you hurt?</i>

1:11:24.446 --> 1:11:26.907
<i>Jae-eon keeps making me feel excited.</i>

1:11:27.491 --> 1:11:29.493
<i>Do people have to date?</i>

1:11:29.576 --> 1:11:32.830
<i>Why can't two people just be close?</i>

1:11:32.913 --> 1:11:34.123
<i>Can't they stand near each other?</i>

1:11:34.206 --> 1:11:36.542
<i>Do they have to pretend not to notice
if there's something in their hair?</i>

1:11:37.251 --> 1:11:39.878
<i>What do I want from Jae-eon?</i>

1:11:39.962 --> 1:11:42.172
<i>You sometimes suddenly act cold to me.</i>

1:11:42.256 --> 1:11:46.260
Bit-na and I are going to drink
at my house. Do you want to come?

1:11:46.343 --> 1:11:48.554
The two people
the bottle points to have to kiss!

1:11:50.556 --> 1:11:54.018
<i>Right. I should just check for myself
and forget about him.</i>

1:11:56.020 --> 1:11:59.440
