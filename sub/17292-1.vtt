[Rebecca]
<i>Previously on </i>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:02.920 --> 00:06.089
Whoever this Josh Chan is,
you're obsessed with him.

00:06.173 --> 00:07.883
<i>You're saying</i>
<i>that I moved here from New York,</i>

00:07.966 --> 00:11.136
<i>and I left behind a job</i>
<i>that would have paid me $545,000 a year,</i>

00:11.220 --> 00:14.556
<i>for a guy I dated for two months</i>
<i>when I was 16 at a summer camp?</i>

00:14.640 --> 00:16.975
<i>Here's what happened.</i>
<i>I was in New York. I ran into Josh.</i>

00:17.059 --> 00:19.561
<i>He made me feel warm inside</i>
<i>like glitter was exploding inside me.</i>

00:19.645 --> 00:22.105
Then I moved here.
I did not move here because of Josh.

00:22.189 --> 00:24.566
Because that would be crazy
and I am not crazy.

00:24.650 --> 00:28.487
I'm so happy that you're in town,
and I don't think you're crazy at all.

00:28.570 --> 00:30.364
I love him so much.

00:30.447 --> 00:32.324
-Do you love her?
-No.

00:32.407 --> 00:35.702
Greg, listen to me,
you're not second choice. I promise.

00:35.786 --> 00:38.038
-[sighs]
-[Paula] <i>He is Josh's best friend, okay?</i>

00:38.121 --> 00:40.290
If you sleep with Josh's best friend,
that ruins any possibility

00:40.374 --> 00:43.835
<i>for when you finally come to your senses</i>
<i>and realize that you are meant for Josh.</i>

00:43.919 --> 00:46.088
-You're sleeping with Rebecca?
-All the time, a lot.

00:46.171 --> 00:49.216
It's Greg? It's Greg?
You're sleeping with Greg?

00:49.299 --> 00:51.260
I care about you a lot.

00:51.343 --> 00:54.513
We have fun together,
but let's not, like, plan out our future.

00:54.596 --> 00:57.933
-Wait, what?
-[Josh] <i>Rebecca, Valencia and I are done.</i>

00:58.016 --> 01:01.270
Come with me.
No matter what I do, I feel you with me.

01:01.353 --> 01:04.648
Can I tell you something?
I moved here for you.

01:04.731 --> 01:06.900
<i>This is our moment, Josh Chan.</i>

01:06.984 --> 01:10.779
I'm so excited that our love story
can finally begin.

01:27.671 --> 01:29.298
Did you mean what you said?

01:31.133 --> 01:33.218
You moved here for me?

01:36.597 --> 01:37.681
Okay...

01:38.849 --> 01:40.434
Yes.

01:40.517 --> 01:41.935
Yes. Yes, I did.

01:42.019 --> 01:45.397
And I know it sounds weird,
but allow me-- Okay.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.650
You have to understand,
when I ran into you in New York,

01:48.734 --> 01:51.903
I was at a very low moment.

01:51.987 --> 01:55.574
And I mean, I don't know.
If I'd run into Reuben Fishwell...

01:55.657 --> 01:57.492
Remember that guy from camp
with the chapped lips?

01:57.576 --> 01:59.995
If I'd run into him... I don't know...

02:00.078 --> 02:03.790
I might have fallen into Michigan
and started a lip balm company.

02:04.666 --> 02:05.500
Okay.

02:05.584 --> 02:11.173
But what did you mean when you said,
"Our love story can finally begin"?

02:13.967 --> 02:17.304
Um, our what? Our-- Our love story?

02:17.387 --> 02:20.140
-I didn't say that. You said that.
-Wait, what?

02:20.223 --> 02:23.393
Josh, I think you need to take a moment
and figure out why you're so fixated

02:23.477 --> 02:26.021
on every little thing I supposedly said.

02:26.104 --> 02:29.107
'Cause it feels like you're
an emotional stenographer right now.

02:29.191 --> 02:32.319
-You definitely said our--
-Okay. Let's recap the events of tonight.

02:32.402 --> 02:34.905
So, you show up at Jayma's wedding,
looking all Danny Zuko,

02:34.988 --> 02:37.908
and the leather jacket
that literally came out of space,

02:37.991 --> 02:39.785
clutching my old camp letter
to your heart, saying you can't stop thinking about me.

02:41.745 --> 02:43.705
-Right, but then--
-The more I think about this, actually,

02:43.789 --> 02:47.334
I get more uncomfortable,
so let's just stop talking about it, okay?

02:47.417 --> 02:50.003
Like, 'cause we've had sex once
and you're talking about love.

02:50.087 --> 02:51.755
And I just think we need
to pump the brakes.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.802
Actually, can you take me home?
God, I'm so cold.

02:56.885 --> 03:01.390
-Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

03:02.766 --> 03:04.976
Look, I'll let you off the hook

03:05.060 --> 03:07.396
just because
you did me so good back there.

03:07.479 --> 03:08.689
-[scoffs]
-I don't know.

03:08.772 --> 03:10.649
Do you want to get
some, like, fast food and...

03:10.732 --> 03:13.819
I'll try to forget about all
the crazy stuff you just said? Wow.

03:15.570 --> 03:18.115
-Yeah. [chuckles]
-Okay.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.035

[breathing heavily]
Wow. That was awesome.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.319
Thank you, Rebecca.
You're really good at that.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.447
Oh, you flatter me, my lord.

03:58.530 --> 04:00.490
[both laugh]

04:00.574 --> 04:03.160
-[sighs] Here you go.
-Oh! Thank you.

04:03.994 --> 04:07.873
Mm. It's all right. It's my pleasure.
You've had such a rough day.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.916
Inventory is so stressful.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.879
Actually, it's not that big a deal.
We split it up. We chunk it.

04:15.672 --> 04:18.759
Oh, thanks again for letting me crash here
while I'm in-between places.

04:18.842 --> 04:21.178
Oh, my gosh, of course.
It's the least I could do.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.680
You gave up your apartment to Valencia
after you guys broke up,

04:23.764 --> 04:25.182
like a real gentleman.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.808
[chuckles, inhales]

04:29.436 --> 04:33.273
Well, I guess it's time to hit the couch.

04:34.941 --> 04:37.402
Oh! Yeah, right.

04:37.486 --> 04:39.029
Um...

04:39.112 --> 04:42.157
Hey, but, you know,
if you just wanted to snuggle in the bed

04:42.240 --> 04:45.410
and sleep with me tonight, you could.

04:45.494 --> 04:49.289
I think this is best. Keeps things simpler
between us, you know?

04:50.248 --> 04:51.958
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You're right. Yeah.

04:52.042 --> 04:54.085
-Yeah.
-Okay.

04:54.169 --> 04:55.128
Yeah.

04:56.254 --> 04:57.255
[groans]

04:59.466 --> 05:01.718
He's still sleeping on the couch?
It's been three weeks.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.386
Exactly. Our relationship is new.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.263
Yeah, okay.
But he's not sleeping in your bed, and he's not telling anyone
you're together.

05:07.224 --> 05:10.227
-Of course, he's not telling anyone--
-Ba-ba-bah! Cookie!

05:10.310 --> 05:12.062
Okay, you-- you have to admit it.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.106
I mean, you just-- you really
screwed things up with Josh.

05:15.190 --> 05:17.442
The second that you told him
you moved here for him--

05:17.526 --> 05:19.694
I mean, you know-- [imitates explosion]
It was game over.

05:19.778 --> 05:22.280
No, no, no. You keep saying that,
but I fixed it that night.

05:22.364 --> 05:24.366
I fixed it on the way home
with Josh, remember?

05:24.449 --> 05:27.410
Can you take me home?
God, I'm so cold.

05:27.494 --> 05:30.038
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

05:30.121 --> 05:31.873
-I'm sorry.
-[Rebecca] <i>You see what I did there?</i>

05:31.957 --> 05:36.628
I made Josh feel like he was the one
pushing me into a commitment.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.296
I mean, it was a brilliant argument.

05:38.380 --> 05:40.841
It was better than
Sullivan vs. the State of New York City,

05:40.924 --> 05:45.220
in which I proved that black mold
actually raises SAT scores.

05:45.303 --> 05:49.266
Brilliant rhetoric,
but if it had actually worked,

05:49.348 --> 05:52.060
he'd be sleeping in your bed right now
and he's not.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.521
Honey, he's just there for the sex.
He's exploiting you.

05:54.604 --> 05:57.524
He's... He's "effsploiting" you.
[gasps]

05:57.607 --> 06:00.277
He's effs-- Oh, that's really good.
I just came up with that.

06:00.359 --> 06:02.028
I should monetize that.
Should I buy an url?

06:02.112 --> 06:04.322
-No, it's URL.
-And is it "jif" or "gif"?

06:04.406 --> 06:07.242
Nobody knows.
And, Paula, he's not effsploiting me.

06:07.325 --> 06:12.956
If anything, he's, um... "respeffing" me.
Yes, he's respeffing the hell out of me.

06:13.039 --> 06:13.915
Face it, Rebecca.

06:13.999 --> 06:16.543
What you've got with Josh
is an Airbnb with benefits.

06:16.626 --> 06:19.087
You are so wrong. You don't even know
what happened this morning.

06:19.170 --> 06:21.506
Okay, so I was getting dressed.
Joshie walks in.

06:21.590 --> 06:22.424
Hey, babe.

06:22.507 --> 06:27.554
Hey, ba-- uh, there.
Uh, gotta hustle or I'll be late for work.

06:28.555 --> 06:31.850
Have you seen my socks?
The good ones that wick moisture?

06:31.933 --> 06:33.894
I have not.

06:33.977 --> 06:35.186
Ugh!

06:35.270 --> 06:38.982
I don't want to put my gi in
with my dirty clothes.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.984
It's disrespectful to the practice.

06:41.067 --> 06:46.656
Hey! Uh, this just popped into my nogs.
Why don't you leave a few things here?

06:46.740 --> 06:49.451
You shouldn't have to keep everything
in your car like a vagrant.

06:49.534 --> 06:51.369
And I live two blocks from the dojo.

06:51.453 --> 06:54.122
Just-- at least, keep your karate
stuff here. It just makes sense.

06:54.205 --> 06:57.876
You're already doing a lot. I...
I don't want to take up any space.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.252
I mean, are you sure?

06:59.336 --> 07:01.838
You will not take up space.
I have plenty of room.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.590
Just put it in one of my drawers.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.967
-Come on.
-Okay, cool.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.135
Yeah.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.600
Is that Greg's sweatshirt?

07:14.893 --> 07:17.270
Greg said he wanted to go to Emory, right?

07:17.354 --> 07:19.481
No. No, no, no. That's not Greg's.

07:19.564 --> 07:23.068
That's... That's my friend Emory's.
It's funny. It's a joke.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.236
She has a sweatshirt
that says "Rebecca" on it.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.032
Okay, yeah, that's Greg's, but it's fine.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.201
-Forget Greg.
-Man, Greg...

07:31.284 --> 07:33.912
I haven't seen him
since you and I started...

07:33.995 --> 07:35.664
[muttering]
you know, just like...

07:35.747 --> 07:36.790
Ah--

07:36.873 --> 07:39.376
-I know. You know what? [chuckles]
-[sighs

07:39.459 --> 07:45.298
Greg's doing great.
I've barely heard from him, so he is fine.

07:45.382 --> 07:48.468
-Uh, Greg is not fine.
-Oh, yes, he is.

07:48.551 --> 07:51.388
I showed you the one text I've gotten
from him in what, a month?

07:51.471 --> 07:52.305
No, please, no.

07:52.389 --> 07:53.390
-Let's read it.
-Not again.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.392
"Hey, Bunch, sorry about Jayma's wedding.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.309
I ducked up.

07:56.393 --> 07:59.312
This morning, I found out my mom
had some bad plastic surgery,

07:59.396 --> 08:03.233
so I gotta go to L.A. for a few weeks
and help her take care of the kids.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.068
See you when I get back."

08:05.151 --> 08:08.113
And that's it. Radio silence
for the rest of the month.

08:08.196 --> 08:10.657
So, you and Josh needn't worry about Greg.

08:10.740 --> 08:13.743
I am clearly out of his life
and that's cool. I'm over it.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.203
Yeah. Are you? Are you really?

08:15.286 --> 08:16.997
Because when you went
to the wedding with Greg,

08:17.080 --> 08:18.540
you were, like, in love with him.

08:18.623 --> 08:20.291
Was I? I don't think
I was in love with him.

08:20.375 --> 08:21.918
You are ping-ponging around.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.420
-No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.047
And it is not good for you. Or me.

08:26.131 --> 08:28.800
Do you remember when I found out you
were sleeping with Greg, in the hospital?

08:28.883 --> 08:31.261
I screamed at you so hard,
I strained my groin.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.389
-Do you even want the plain hummus?
-Ech, no.

08:34.472 --> 08:36.349
-Who eats plain hummus? All right.
-What's wrong, Paula?

08:36.433 --> 08:38.518
It's like you don't even believe
in me and Josh anymore.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.272
Whoa-whoa-whoa, wait. You don't?

08:42.355 --> 08:47.444
I used to think that you two had destiny
on your side. I really did.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.738
-Paula!
-I hate to say it, but I just--

08:49.821 --> 08:52.449
I don't think Josh cares about you
the way you want him to.

08:52.532 --> 08:56.119
I thought you were a great romance.
And you know what? Maybe I was wrong.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.245
-What? Paula!
-Okay.

08:57.328 --> 08:59.456
-I can't-- Ah! How can you say that?
-Okay.

08:59.539 --> 09:03.293
How can you say that?
No. He loves me. He loves me!

09:03.376 --> 09:05.962
Listen, let me tell you something.
When we make love,

09:06.046 --> 09:09.174
the way he looks into my eyes
without looking away...

09:09.257 --> 09:11.509
He-- He holds me in his arms.

09:11.593 --> 09:14.054
I know it. I know he feels the same way.

09:14.137 --> 09:17.766
And hello! This morning,
he made a massive commitment to me.

09:17.849 --> 09:21.394
-Ooh! What?
-It's the drawer, Paula. The drawer.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.146
Don't you see what the drawer means?

09:23.229 --> 09:26.816
Yes, I do. It means you're ducking
a homeless man.

09:28.026 --> 09:30.779
-No, you're wrong. Because he loves me.
-How do you know?

09:30.862 --> 09:35.408
I mean, besides the sex.
What evidence do you have that he cares?

09:36.159 --> 09:37.160
[sighs]

09:37.243 --> 09:38.995
[wind blowing]

09:40.080 --> 09:41.581
[Rebecca]
<i>How do I know he loves me?</i> <i>It's the little things.</i>

09:44.459 --> 09:47.128
<i>Little compliments here and there</i>
<i>that I secretly stockpile</i>

09:47.212 --> 09:49.005
<i>in my woman brain.</i>

09:49.089 --> 09:50.715
<i>I can live for days off a single--</i>

09:50.799 --> 09:52.884
You really listen to me.

09:53.843 --> 09:55.887
<i>I'm like a sexy fashion cactus.</i>

09:55.970 --> 09:59.182
<i>Living from compliment to compliment,</i>
<i>hint to hint,</i>

09:59.265 --> 10:01.768
<i>storing them in my body</i>
<i>through long periods of drought.</i>

10:02.894 --> 10:07.899
<i>I may look dry, but if you cut me open,</i>
<i>you'll find only water inside.</i>

10:08.983 --> 10:12.278

-But I can say, he's fine.
-He's fine? What does that mean?

21:15.357 --> 21:18.402
You know what?
You're clearly no help, so-- Yeah, bye.

21:18.486 --> 21:21.655
Patrons can't be back here.
It's, like, a health code violation.

21:21.739 --> 21:24.158
You're painting your toe nails
on top of potatoes.

21:25.451 --> 21:28.120
Yeah, they're gonna be peeled.

21:29.497 --> 21:34.919
Okay. Heather, I need to find Greg
and I know you know where he is.

21:35.002 --> 21:37.630
Oh, I really don't. All I know is,
it's awesome he's not around,

21:37.713 --> 21:40.800
'cause I get all his shifts,
and now I can finally buy that kayak.

21:41.759 --> 21:45.805
-What? I'm outdoorsy.
-Oh, God, you're useless, too.

21:47.223 --> 21:51.936
Oh, God. I really didn't want
to have to do this.

21:53.312 --> 21:57.441
<i>-Buongiorno, Marco. Come stai?</i>
-Oh, man, this crazy bitch.

21:57.525 --> 21:59.777
Wow. That was barely under your breath.

22:00.569 --> 22:02.863
Um, I brought you some hummus.

22:02.947 --> 22:06.492
Ah. It's plain. Who eats plain hummus?

22:06.575 --> 22:08.536
Okay, Marco, I know
you don't know me that well--

22:08.619 --> 22:09.620
But I know your type.

22:09.703 --> 22:12.748
You mess up people's lives,
and then pass it off as quirky.

22:12.832 --> 22:15.000
Excuse me. I do not do-- Whoa!

22:15.084 --> 22:17.795
[giggling]
Silly me.

22:17.878 --> 22:20.756
Listen, I am looking for Greg.

22:20.840 --> 22:25.052
Uh, we had... a thing,
and I haven't heard back from him.

22:25.135 --> 22:26.220
What does that tell you?

22:26.303 --> 22:29.139
Maybe he needs a little break
from you and your "whoo-whoo-whoo."

22:31.225 --> 22:33.853
Okay, I can see I'm not gonna
get anywhere with you.

22:33.936 --> 22:35.271
No. No, you're not.

22:35.353 --> 22:36.397
[sighs]

22:36.480 --> 22:37.648
-Okay. Good day, sir.
-Okay.

22:37.731 --> 22:40.985
-Hey, I didn't-- I'll just take that.
-You said you didn't like plain.

22:41.068 --> 22:42.945
-I'll add red peppers myself.
-That's weird.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.113
Let go.

22:48.409 --> 22:49.577
[sighs]

22:53.080 --> 22:56.750
-Thanks for covering for me, Dad.
-Oh, hey, look, anytime.

22:58.544 --> 23:01.797
Sometime soon, you're gonna have
to tell everyone the truth.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.258
Even this crazy chick.

23:06.260 --> 23:07.136
I know.

23:19.523 --> 23:21.358
[whistling]

23:25.529 --> 23:26.822
[loud popping]

23:27.448 --> 23:28.949
[stammering]
The safe is under the desk.

23:29.033 --> 23:31.243
-The code is 2738.
-What?

23:31.327 --> 23:33.203
[rustling, popping]

23:34.455 --> 23:38.083
-What the...?
-Dude, what the hell?

23:38.167 --> 23:40.794
You scared the crap out of me!
What are you doing in here?

23:40.878 --> 23:46.050
Um, I kinda slept here.
Or, at least, I tried to.

23:46.133 --> 23:50.554
I don't have a place to live.
Is it cool if I crash here for a few days?

23:50.638 --> 23:52.514
You always say how Aloha is a chill place.

23:52.598 --> 23:56.852
Bro, this is your workplace.
It's just so unprofesh.

23:56.936 --> 23:59.271
You gotta get your life together.
Okay? Grow up.

23:59.355 --> 24:01.523
Dude, I'm grown up!

24:01.607 --> 24:02.733
-[loud pop]
-[snickers]

24:02.816 --> 24:05.986
Sorry. One of those was a fart.

24:06.070 --> 24:08.781
Dude, I'm, like, a year younger than you,

24:08.864 --> 24:13.535
and I've got a house and two kids,
and you're sleeping on packing materials.

24:13.619 --> 24:17.539
Well, I was staying on a friend's couch,
but I can't do that anymore.

24:17.623 --> 24:19.375
Hector, he lives with his mom.

24:19.457 --> 24:21.377
White Josh
is with his boyfriend all the time.

24:21.459 --> 24:23.879
-Beans' house was condemned.
-I don't know who those people are.

24:23.963 --> 24:27.174
So my only choices are staying here,
or living with my parents.

24:27.257 --> 24:30.886
Dude, you gotta figure it out
because you can't stay here.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.722
-[sighs]
-[popping]

24:39.103 --> 24:41.397
I don't know what to do,
because if I don't find Greg,

24:41.479 --> 24:43.691
I won't be able to confess everything
about me and Josh,

24:43.774 --> 24:46.276
and get his unconditional blessing,
and then I'm just gonna lose everything.

24:46.360 --> 24:49.196
-Including the Scott Joplin drawer.
-The what?

24:49.279 --> 24:50.447
[sighs]

24:50.531 --> 24:53.033
<i>♪ It's the drawer that I gave to Josh ♪</i>

24:53.117 --> 24:54.910
Never mind. Paula, okay, I need your help.

24:54.994 --> 24:58.831
Because I need to find Greg
and I don't know how, but I know you do.

25:00.916 --> 25:04.003
Please, please, please, please.
You're so good at this stuff.

25:04.086 --> 25:08.841
You're so good at it.
It would be so easy for you.

25:11.343 --> 25:14.013
Uh, is your foot on my crotch?

25:14.096 --> 25:16.348
I'm sorry. I forgot
what I was trying to do here.

25:16.432 --> 25:20.060
Paula, um, I'm desperate.

25:20.144 --> 25:23.564
Okay? Really, I need--
I need to find Greg.

25:23.647 --> 25:26.650
No. Honey, honey, honey,
honey, I told you...

25:27.943 --> 25:31.529
Oh, my God, this is a workplace.
Okay? No sleeves, no service.

25:31.613 --> 25:32.530
Shh!

25:32.614 --> 25:34.074
Thanks for bringing me lunch, Joshua.

25:34.158 --> 25:37.995
And before you leave,
I've got a little something for you.

25:38.704 --> 25:39.537
Oh!

25:39.621 --> 25:40.956
-Boom.
-That's great.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.000
-It'll make things easier.
-Mm-hmm.

25:43.083 --> 25:45.794
Sorry, you're giving him a key
to your apartment? What?

25:45.878 --> 25:46.754
That's right.

25:46.837 --> 25:49.048
I gave this man the key to my heart,

25:49.131 --> 25:52.718
and now I'm giving him the key
to my "ap-heart-ment."

25:52.801 --> 25:55.679
-Mm...
-[chuckling]

25:55.763 --> 25:57.723
But he doesn't have a drawer, right?

25:57.806 --> 26:00.517
What? A drawer?
No. Because he's got a dresser.

26:00.601 --> 26:03.937
Just for the essentials.
Protein powder, glutamine, socks.

26:04.021 --> 26:04.855
Mm-hmm.

26:05.606 --> 26:07.399
-I want that.
-You want broccoli?

26:07.483 --> 26:11.945
No. No, I want-- I want--
I want a key. I want a dresser.

26:12.029 --> 26:16.283
And I can have it all, Paula.
All I need to do is just find Greg.

26:17.242 --> 26:18.410
Don't do those--

26:18.494 --> 26:21.038
No Bambi eyes.
You know, I can't-- I can't.

26:21.121 --> 26:23.916
Not-- No, stop it.

26:23.999 --> 26:25.292
Oh, God. It's so tempting.

26:25.375 --> 26:27.544
It's like a box full of donuts
under my face.

26:27.628 --> 26:30.172
-Eat the donut, Paula.
-Mm...

26:30.255 --> 26:35.552
-Eat it.
-No.

26:35.636 --> 26:36.594
Maybe.

26:40.349 --> 26:43.519
Paula, thank you so much
for helping me find Greg.

26:43.601 --> 26:47.856
I know it makes you feel dirty
and hate yourself, but I really need it.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.066
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

26:49.149 --> 26:50.692
-All right.
-Yay-yay-yay.

26:50.776 --> 26:53.611
All we have to do
is take the IP address of his phone,

26:53.695 --> 26:57.366
which I have, and then I triangulate
the cell tower records,

26:57.449 --> 27:00.786
which are way easier to access
than they should be.

27:00.869 --> 27:02.412
Yeah, Snowden was a hero.

27:02.496 --> 27:05.165
And <i>voila.</i>

27:05.249 --> 27:07.376
All Greg's comings
and goings for the last month. Wow!

27:09.670 --> 27:12.172
This is insane. You're so good.

27:12.256 --> 27:13.590
-Thank you.
-You're so good.

27:13.674 --> 27:14.550
I know.

27:14.632 --> 27:17.052
Mm! It's really sexy.

27:17.136 --> 27:20.097
Okay, let's see. So, it looks like Greg
has been going from his house

27:20.180 --> 27:22.683
to a location on East Cameron every day?

27:22.766 --> 27:24.101
Yeah. Okay, hold on.

27:24.184 --> 27:27.187
-It is locking down on a place.
-What could that be?

27:27.271 --> 27:29.982
-What's on East Cameron?
-Okay, like, literally everything.

27:30.065 --> 27:31.316
-Oh.
-[computer dings]

27:31.400 --> 27:32.526
-There it is.
-Hey, okay.

27:32.609 --> 27:33.651
-Okay.
-Got it. All right.

27:33.735 --> 27:36.029
-All right, come on! Let's go!
-No. Nope. I--

27:36.113 --> 27:38.532
Oh, I have so much work to do,
and I just--

27:38.615 --> 27:41.368
Hey, Paula.
You're cervix deep in this now. Let's go.

27:49.960 --> 27:53.297
I'm so glad we didn't change your room,
so it's ready for you.

27:53.380 --> 27:54.214
Yeah.

27:54.298 --> 27:58.927
Your father wanted to make your room
into an indoor sauna. [giggles]

27:59.011 --> 28:02.055
-But I said, "What if he comes back?"
-It's just temporary, Mom.

28:02.139 --> 28:06.602
-I just need time to save up some money.
-A few months, a few years.

28:07.436 --> 28:10.147
I'm just happy you're coming home.

28:10.898 --> 28:14.067
I can make those grilled cheese sandwiches
you like, with the crust cut off.

28:14.151 --> 28:17.279
I'm an adult. I eat crusts now.

28:17.362 --> 28:20.866
Of course, you do, sweetie.

28:29.707 --> 28:31.709
-Where are we? What is this place?
-Uh-oh.

28:31.793 --> 28:35.505
I smell cigarettes and burnt coffee.
You know what that means.

28:36.882 --> 28:37.799
Alcoholics.

28:39.384 --> 28:41.762
But Greg's not an alcoholic.

28:43.847 --> 28:44.848
I drink anywhere.

28:44.932 --> 28:46.475
Tacos and tequila.

28:46.558 --> 28:48.602
But I do my study drinking here.

28:48.685 --> 28:51.063
We're way too sober for this wedding.
How about I get us some shots?

28:51.146 --> 28:53.607
Ooh, I don't leave
when there's whiskey left.

28:53.690 --> 28:58.654
-I need to take a nap.
-Oh, yes, the classic Serrano pass out.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.322
Oh...

29:00.405 --> 29:03.450
-Yeah, I called that one.
-Look, there he is. There he is.

29:04.284 --> 29:07.871
-Hi, I'm Greg.
-Oh, shh, shh! He's gonna say something.

29:07.955 --> 29:11.250
So, I'm here because one night,

29:11.333 --> 29:15.879
I had ten cocktails at a wedding,
as one does.

29:15.963 --> 29:21.093
And then, I passed out
in my own vomit, as one does.

29:21.843 --> 29:25.013
The next morning,
I got in my car and a cop stopped me,

29:25.097 --> 29:26.723
as they do when you're weaving.

29:26.807 --> 29:28.058
And, um...

29:29.476 --> 29:32.479
It turns out I was still legally drunk
from the night before,

29:32.562 --> 29:37.442
and I got arrested, as again, one does.

29:37.526 --> 29:38.360
Um...

29:39.278 --> 29:43.198
The judge sentenced me to come here
every day for a month.

29:44.700 --> 29:48.120
[sighs] My plan was to knock out
these meetings, get my court card signed,

29:48.203 --> 29:51.873
and go back to being as angry as I could
with just about anyone I could think of.

29:51.957 --> 29:57.170
My mom, my dad, my job, West Covina,
men who wear skinny jeans.

29:57.254 --> 29:58.964
-[man] Yeah!
-Thank you, Frank.

29:59.840 --> 30:03.302
But that whole time, there was
one person I was really angry at.

30:03.385 --> 30:05.178
That's me. It's me. He's talking about me.

30:06.346 --> 30:08.307
-Myself.
-Oh, it's him. It's him.

30:08.390 --> 30:09.850
-That's better. It's him.
-Yeah, way better.

30:09.933 --> 30:12.019
I'm responsible
for not only what happened that night,

30:12.102 --> 30:15.647
but for the whole mess that was my life
up to that night.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.275
And now, I see...

30:19.818 --> 30:22.321
I needed to face something
that I'd always known...

30:24.323 --> 30:25.907
That I'm an alcoholic.

30:27.951 --> 30:29.661
And I've known that
since I had my first drink.

30:29.745 --> 30:34.875
My first sip felt like-- I don't know--
like glitter was exploding inside of me.

30:34.958 --> 30:38.045
[sighs, clears throat]

30:38.128 --> 30:39.629
That's how alcohol affects me.

30:40.714 --> 30:43.008
So, here I am, facing that reality.

30:43.091 --> 30:47.929
And now that I have, the funny thing is,
I'm not as angry anymore...

30:48.013 --> 30:51.516
at anyone, really, including myself.

30:51.600 --> 30:54.436
I mean, the guys who still wear
the skinny jeans-- I mean, enough already.

30:54.519 --> 30:55.896
-[Frank] Yeah!
-Yeah. Amen, Frank.

30:55.979 --> 30:57.147
Um...

30:57.230 --> 30:58.440
Anyway, thank you all for listening,

30:58.523 --> 31:01.651
and thanks for putting up with me
over these past few weeks,

31:01.735 --> 31:04.279
when I just thought
you were a bunch of sad losers.

31:04.363 --> 31:07.032
But now, I know that I am...
uh, we're not...

31:07.115 --> 31:11.828
You know what I'm saying. Also,
I'm so sorry for the glitter metaphor. I don't know where that came from,
uh, but it felt right, so...

31:20.462 --> 31:25.509
So, is now a bad time
to tell him about Josh?

31:30.472 --> 31:32.099
-Mm-mm-mm.
-Really?

31:34.226 --> 31:38.438
God, I felt so bad
at that meeting tonight.

31:38.522 --> 31:40.357
Yeah, tough break for Greg.

31:40.440 --> 31:43.235
[scoffs] I don't care about that guy.
I always knew he was a boozer.

31:43.318 --> 31:45.654
No, I feel bad
because I realized something. That glitter feeling, I know that feeling.

31:48.156 --> 31:52.411
I feel it every time I do those bad things
to help Rebecca.

31:55.789 --> 31:57.499
It's like my drug.

31:57.582 --> 32:01.753
It's like I swear it off, and then,
tonight, she just pulls me back in.

32:01.837 --> 32:04.464
It's like I did another fistful of blow.

32:04.548 --> 32:06.842
I'm addicted to her life.

32:06.925 --> 32:10.178
It's like the high I get
from those vampire novels,

32:10.262 --> 32:14.433
or <i>The Bachelor, </i>or when I write
a really great legal brief at work.

32:14.516 --> 32:15.851
Why don't you do more of those?

32:15.934 --> 32:18.770
Fill the void with something
you're good at and like.

32:18.854 --> 32:20.439
Write more briefs or something.

32:20.522 --> 32:24.025
Well... [scoffs] I mean,
that's not how it works, Scott.

32:24.109 --> 32:28.321
I mean, I can't just, you know, go around
writing random legal papers for fun.

32:28.405 --> 32:29.364
All right.

32:31.158 --> 32:32.451
You'll figure something out.

32:37.247 --> 32:38.498
[Rebecca]
<i>Paula.</i>

32:38.582 --> 32:40.959
<i>Paula, come back to me. I need you.</i>

32:41.042 --> 32:44.337
I don't know what to do. I can't tell Greg
about me and Josh because--

32:44.421 --> 32:47.257
Poor guy, that's the last thing he needs.
He'll probably start drinking again.

32:47.340 --> 32:50.510
But I was thinking, what if there's a way
for Greg to find out about me and Josh

32:50.594 --> 32:52.471
without me being the bad guy
and having to tell him?

32:52.554 --> 32:54.973
-Rebecca--
-Wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait!

32:55.056 --> 32:57.017
So, I have an idea. This is the bad pitch.

32:57.100 --> 32:59.394
Something like this.
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

32:59.478 --> 33:02.731
So, we arrange somehow,
maybe through the radio,

33:02.814 --> 33:04.441
for Josh and Greg to win a sweepstakes.

33:04.524 --> 33:06.735
Maybe they win, like, $10,000
and a trip to Belize.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.069
So, they're on the beach,

33:08.153 --> 33:10.530
and a skywriter plane flies over them,

33:10.614 --> 33:12.407
and it spells out
"Josh and Rebecca are in love."

33:12.491 --> 33:14.618
Now, by this point--
let's say it's, like, 10 days in--

33:14.701 --> 33:16.286
Josh and Greg are in great moods.

33:16.369 --> 33:19.247
They've been playing with monkeys,
going to cat hotels, drinking mai tais--

33:19.331 --> 33:21.416
-Greg can't drink mai tais.
-Drinking virgin mai tais.

33:21.500 --> 33:24.544
And Greg is gonna see the banner,
with tears in his eyes, turn to Josh,

33:24.628 --> 33:25.879
and say, "Oh, my gosh.

33:25.962 --> 33:28.715
I suddenly know your truth
and you know mine. Embrace me, brother."

33:28.798 --> 33:31.134
Now, as they're hugging,
I come down on a parachute and I go,

33:31.218 --> 33:35.055
"What are you guys doing here?
Did you win a contest? I won a contest."

33:35.138 --> 33:37.307
First draft, all thoughts are welcome.

33:38.433 --> 33:40.977
Perfect. Do it.

33:43.730 --> 33:45.106
No, you're joking. What?

33:46.399 --> 33:49.778
I've given this a lot of thought
and I have made a decision.

33:51.947 --> 33:54.658
I can give advice and I can listen,

33:54.741 --> 33:57.911
but I cannot do any more immoral
or illegal things.

33:57.994 --> 34:00.247
No more schemes. It is not good for me.

34:00.330 --> 34:04.793
And if you are really my friend,
then you will accept it.

34:04.876 --> 34:06.294
Wow. Um...

34:07.879 --> 34:08.922
Okay.

34:10.715 --> 34:11.883
So, you agree?

34:11.967 --> 34:13.301
Uh...

34:13.385 --> 34:14.928
Yeah. I mean, I guess, I agree.

34:15.887 --> 34:19.808
Great! Okay, uh, I just need you
to sign something.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.643
-Mrs. H.?
-Oh, hello.

34:22.894 --> 34:23.853
-What's this?
-Okay.

34:23.937 --> 34:27.232
This is just a simple contract
laying out the terms of our friendship.

34:27.315 --> 34:30.402
It stipulates that my services as a friend
are limited to consultation and support,

34:30.485 --> 34:31.486
and excludes shenanigans.

34:31.570 --> 34:35.156
So, you just need to sign
here, here, and here.

34:35.240 --> 34:37.867
Initial there, there, and there.

34:38.827 --> 34:41.705
Paula, this isn't fair. This is not
what best friends do to each other.

34:41.788 --> 34:45.917
They don't make each other sign
legally binding contracts.

34:46.001 --> 34:47.043
Do you not trust me?

34:47.877 --> 34:49.462
Honey, of course, I trust you.

34:49.546 --> 34:50.505
[scoffs]

34:51.923 --> 34:53.383
I don't trust myself.

35:05.020 --> 35:08.607
-Wow, this is really well done.
-I did it myself. You like it?

35:08.690 --> 35:12.611
I mean, no, I hate it,
but, Paula, it's excellent work.

35:14.821 --> 35:16.698
Are you sure you want me to sign this?

35:20.243 --> 35:21.119
[sighs]

35:21.661 --> 35:22.704
For the friendship.

35:29.419 --> 35:30.629
Ooh.

35:34.382 --> 35:35.342
Thank you.

35:46.019 --> 35:49.022
Dude, you are gonna love
living with your parents.

35:49.105 --> 35:51.566
I mean, everyone says the best part
is the laundry,

35:51.650 --> 35:52.859
but I don't care about that.

35:52.942 --> 35:56.988
Real talk? If I have a nightmare,
I don't have to tough it out.

35:57.072 --> 35:59.491
-You hear what I'm saying?
-Sounds great.

36:00.659 --> 36:01.868
You're doing the right thing, man.

36:01.951 --> 36:04.746
And maybe one of these nights,
we can both take our moms out.

36:04.829 --> 36:06.539
Double date.

36:16.257 --> 36:17.676
