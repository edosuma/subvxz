Aww, don't you worry, little man.
Her name is Marisol.

is an unelected regime, a rogue state.

I'm gonna have to keep an eye on you.

And I thought I put you to bed.

You stay here. Bye!

Care to explain why my husband and I have
been waiting for you for the past hour?

15:16.832 --> 15:20.377
-Is this the pizza place again?
-This is Sandy Burgess!

15:20.461 --> 15:22.671
You're supposed to be
sitting my kids tonight,

15:22.755 --> 15:25.591
but great to know
you're having a pizza party.

15:25.674 --> 15:28.093
-No idea what you're talking about.
-[Jimbo giggles]

15:28.177 --> 15:29.887
I spoke to your mom this morning.

15:29.970 --> 15:33.390
She said she'd tell you.
Are you calling your mom a liar?

15:33.474 --> 15:36.101
No! I was in a rush this morning.

-So you coming to watch my kids or what?
-I'm sitting the Templetons right now.

15:40.648 --> 15:46.737

and call it a playdate, I don't care!

our couples massage appointment,

15:50.324 --> 15:53.619

We'll be right over.

with the Burgess kids,

16:05.756 --> 16:07.508

playing board games,

16:10.427 --> 16:11.679

'cause you're a big boy.

at the community college.

16:23.524 --> 16:26.819
So, we have to go,
but I promise it will be fun. Please?

Okay. Let's go play
with that random family.

we don't make it back safely--

and leave a teenager in charge?

Yeah, someone they trust to protect us.
Doesn't that just prove they love us?

I kind of wish Marisol was here right now.

I had nothing to do with this.

After all the nice stuff you said
and the hugging. There was hugging!

the hugging. Boy, was it executed nicely.

to see the house like this.

I started blaring the radio
because I read they hate loud music.

I opened more windows so it could fly out,
but it just kept flying around the house,

knocking things off the walls,
so I chased it,
