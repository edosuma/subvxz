- That I'm leaving
the Nine-Nine.

[beep]

07:15.043 --> 07:15.435
.

07:15.478 --> 07:17.480
- What do you mean
I've been in a coma?

07:17.524 --> 07:18.699
- A firework
hit you in the head.

07:18.742 --> 07:20.440
It caused a destabilizing
brain injury.

07:20.483 --> 07:22.137
- Oh, my God.

07:22.180 --> 07:23.530
Is Charles okay?
- Yes.

07:23.573 --> 07:25.053
He survived the explosion,

07:25.096 --> 07:27.534
but he blamed himself
for what happened to you

07:27.577 --> 07:29.013
so he left New York.

07:29.057 --> 07:32.060
He's actually the sheriff
of a small town in Arizona.

07:32.103 --> 07:34.410
The town is so small he also
has to be the school principal.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.238
- Okay, that's weird.

07:36.281 --> 07:38.240
- It's actually very funny.

07:38.283 --> 07:39.894
And surprisingly heartwarming.

07:39.937 --> 07:41.243
- Wait, no. No, no, no.

07:41.286 --> 07:43.071
This--this isn't
really happening.

07:43.114 --> 07:44.420
I'm dreaming.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.509
And because this is a dream,
I'm in control.

07:46.553 --> 07:48.946
You know who's gonna walk
through that door right now?

07:48.990 --> 07:51.253
Bruce Willis.

07:51.296 --> 07:53.821
- Jake, you woke up!
- No! Teddy?

07:53.864 --> 07:55.779
Amy, why is
your ex-boyfriend here?

07:55.823 --> 07:57.041
- Oh, you haven't
told him yet, babe?

07:57.085 --> 07:58.173
- Uh.
- Babe?

07:58.216 --> 07:59.566
He called you babe.
What's going on?

07:59.609 --> 08:01.176
- I'm sorry,
I know this is a lot.

08:01.219 --> 08:02.569
- No.
- But the last seven years

08:02.612 --> 08:04.571
have been really hard.
Raising Mac on my own,

08:04.614 --> 08:05.746
never knowing
if you would wake up,

08:05.789 --> 08:08.270
and Teddy was
a great friend to me.

08:08.313 --> 08:09.619
And a couple years ago,

08:09.663 --> 08:11.403
we went on a trip.
- It's not her fault.

08:11.447 --> 08:13.101
We were both seduced
by the city of Tampa.

08:13.144 --> 08:15.277
- I can't believe this.
You replaced me with Teddy?

08:15.320 --> 08:16.757
- I could never
replace you, Jake.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.759
I just wanted Mac to have
a father figure in his life.

08:18.802 --> 08:20.369
I come over
and we watch sports.

08:20.412 --> 08:22.937
We are obsessed
with college swimming.

08:22.980 --> 08:24.547
- Hey, doc, can you put me
back in the coma?

08:24.591 --> 08:26.723
- You're agitated,
that's normal.

08:26.767 --> 08:28.290
Tell me how you're feeling.
Pain?

08:28.333 --> 08:29.509
- I mean, just the pain
of learning

08:29.552 --> 08:30.945
that my wife is married
to another man.

08:30.988 --> 08:32.033
- Oh, we're not married.

08:32.076 --> 08:33.034
I'm just here
for Amy physically.

08:33.077 --> 08:34.252
- That's worse!

08:34.296 --> 08:35.819
- Okay, let's do
some cognitive tests.

08:35.863 --> 08:37.865
How good is your memory
from before the accident?

08:37.908 --> 08:40.171
Do you remember the fireworks?
- Yeah, I remember everything.

08:40.215 --> 08:41.651
I remember the whole heist,

08:41.695 --> 08:43.435
going to find Charles,
the magnet suits.

08:43.479 --> 08:44.741
- Do you remember
where you hid the tube?

08:44.785 --> 08:47.048
- Yeah, inside the fake baby.

08:47.091 --> 08:48.353
- Thanks, babe.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.618
- Oh, no.
It's not the future, is it?

08:51.661 --> 08:53.620
- No, it's only been
about 40 minutes?

08:53.663 --> 08:55.970
And this isn't a real hospital.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.976
- You Mission: Impossibled me!

09:02.019 --> 09:05.501
Oh, I'm so happy you're not
having sex with Teddy!

09:05.545 --> 09:06.589
[wheezing laugh]

09:06.633 --> 09:07.938
- Damn it, we're locked in.

09:07.982 --> 09:09.505
Who are you working with,
you coward?

09:09.549 --> 09:10.637
- I didn't do anything.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.595
I bet this was
all Santiago's plan.

09:12.639 --> 09:14.423
She's making a play
for the tube.

09:14.466 --> 09:16.120
She knew you hid it
at Doggy Daycare.

09:16.164 --> 09:17.382
- How do you know her plan?

09:17.426 --> 09:18.775
- Since I wasn't part
of the heist,

09:18.819 --> 09:20.429
people were sloppy around me
with their secrets.

09:20.472 --> 09:21.909
I know everything.

09:21.952 --> 09:23.388
For instance,
I know the real tube

09:23.432 --> 09:25.477
is inside that creepy,
fake baby doll.

09:25.521 --> 09:26.609
- Why didn't you tell me
this earlier?

09:26.653 --> 09:28.002
- I was trying to be respectful

09:28.045 --> 09:29.220
of the heisting process,

09:29.264 --> 09:31.353
but that was before
I got screwed over.

09:31.396 --> 09:33.355
- Well, your intel is of no use

09:33.398 --> 09:35.270
since we're locked in here.

09:35.313 --> 09:37.838
Unless you smash your
gigantic body through the wall.

09:37.881 --> 09:39.883
- I am not the Kool-Aid Man!
- Okay.

09:39.927 --> 09:42.277
- I am more than my muscles
and I can prove it.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.975
All the locks in this building
have a magnetic release

09:45.019 --> 09:46.324
in case of a fire.

09:46.368 --> 09:48.631
If we can overload
the circuit, they'll unlock.

09:48.675 --> 09:49.850
We just need to connect

09:49.893 --> 09:52.026
the positive terminal
of one outlet...

09:52.069 --> 09:54.115
[grunts]
To the negative of the other,

09:54.158 --> 09:57.118
using this circuit board
and a low-resistance wire.

09:57.161 --> 09:59.468
Luckily, I came prepared.

09:59.511 --> 10:01.296
- Do suspenders
conduct electricity?

10:01.339 --> 10:03.167
Oh, the gold thread!

10:03.211 --> 10:06.083
- Now, we are about
to overload the circuit.

10:07.563 --> 10:09.086
[electricity zapping]

10:10.435 --> 10:11.611
- Bing pot.

10:11.654 --> 10:13.047
- When did you have time
to build all this?

10:13.090 --> 10:14.831
- Oh, I had it prefabbed
months ago,

10:14.875 --> 10:16.267
and I set it up while
you were looking for Charles.

10:16.311 --> 10:18.269
- You planted the resignation
letter in my locker

10:18.313 --> 10:19.706
so Charles would find it.
- Yep.

10:19.749 --> 10:22.012
And then I knew you'd wanna
show off the fireworks.

10:22.056 --> 10:24.667
The fireworks that I sold you.
- You're Kristaps?

10:26.147 --> 10:27.714
- Gah, I got to stop
falling for that.

10:27.757 --> 10:29.846
But wait, if everything
was fake, what knocked me out?

10:29.890 --> 10:32.196
[timer beeping rapidly]
Oh, no.

10:33.676 --> 10:35.069
- What are you doing?
- I know, Charles,

10:35.112 --> 10:37.332
but there's something
I have to tell you, okay?

10:37.375 --> 10:38.768
I locked Charles
in a supply closet.

10:38.812 --> 10:41.031
- I have but two things
to say to you.

10:41.075 --> 10:42.206
One: thank you.

10:42.250 --> 10:43.338
I've always wanted
to be chloroformed.

10:43.381 --> 10:45.601
And, two: how dare you?

10:45.645 --> 10:46.646
- Sorry, babe.

10:46.689 --> 10:49.213
But I play to win.
- Gah!

10:49.257 --> 10:51.259
That was super cool.

10:51.302 --> 10:53.435
I hate how attracted
I am to you right now!

10:53.478 --> 10:54.915
- That worked so well.

10:54.958 --> 10:56.438
On to phase two.

10:56.481 --> 10:57.918
Thanks for doing that, Teddy.

10:57.961 --> 10:59.571
I'm really glad that
we could be friends again.

10:59.615 --> 11:01.182
- Of course.
I'll always be here for you.

11:01.225 --> 11:02.618
Which is why
I have a question to ask.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.446
- Oh, no.
- Amy Santiago,

11:04.489 --> 11:05.447
will you marry--
- No!

11:05.490 --> 11:07.623
I am married to Jake.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.364
- And I'm married to Elizabeth.
It's perfect.

11:09.407 --> 11:10.539
Plus, you just betrayed him.

11:10.582 --> 11:12.019
You guys are obviously
having issues.

11:12.062 --> 11:13.760
- No, I only betrayed him
to pull off my secret plan.

11:13.803 --> 11:16.937
I am throwing him
the perfect goodbye

11:16.980 --> 11:18.765
and it has to be a surprise.
- Fine.

11:18.808 --> 11:20.505
But if you think
I'm just gonna sit around

11:20.549 --> 11:23.726
and wait for you
change your mind...

11:23.770 --> 11:24.945
you're right.

11:24.988 --> 11:27.034
I will be parked outside
for two more hours.

11:27.077 --> 11:29.514
- Hello?

11:29.558 --> 11:32.169
Hello? Is there anyone here?

11:34.389 --> 11:36.217
Mlepnos?
- No.

11:36.260 --> 11:37.740
- What? Yeah.

11:37.784 --> 11:38.959
You played violin
at my wedding.

11:39.002 --> 11:42.005
You're Mlepnos!
- No, my name is Jerry.

11:42.049 --> 11:44.529
Jerry Barfralatistan.
- What?

11:44.573 --> 11:46.096
It doesn't matter.
I need your help.

11:46.140 --> 11:47.532
Can you please hand me
the keys that are down there?

11:47.576 --> 11:49.534
Yeah, yeah, yes.

11:49.578 --> 11:50.797
- Thank you, I love keys.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.320
- Oh--
- And this is for you.

11:52.363 --> 11:54.757
[soft chirping]
- What?

11:54.801 --> 11:57.194
- As they say in my country,
a chicky for a key.

11:57.238 --> 11:58.456
- Right.

11:58.500 --> 11:59.501
- And what country
is that again?

11:59.544 --> 12:01.372
- Honolulu.
- Okay.

12:01.416 --> 12:02.547
You know, if it's all the same,

12:02.591 --> 12:03.592
I'd really just rather
have the key.

12:03.635 --> 12:04.680
- You no want chicky?

12:04.724 --> 12:06.508
I don't want key.
- Oh, perfect.

12:06.551 --> 12:08.553
Yes! Thank you, Mlepnos.

12:08.597 --> 12:12.427
- No, it's Jerry...
Barkakanatsan.

12:12.470 --> 12:13.776
- I feel like maybe
you said it a little different

12:13.820 --> 12:15.082
the first time.

12:15.125 --> 12:17.475
There you are,
my cheating my wife!

12:17.519 --> 12:18.999
Give me the tube.
- I don't have it.

12:19.042 --> 12:20.957
The baby's empty.
You lied to me!

12:21.001 --> 12:22.480
- I'm not the liar,
you're the liar.

12:22.524 --> 12:24.308
I put a tracker in the tube
so I know you've hidden it

12:24.352 --> 12:25.788
somewhere in this--nope,
you were telling the truth,

12:25.832 --> 12:28.530
it's on the move.
Someone else has it.

12:28.573 --> 12:29.749
It doesn't matter
what you do, Ames,

12:29.792 --> 12:30.880
you're not gonna
ruin this for me.

12:30.924 --> 12:32.447
- Sorry, Jake,
but I'm afraid I have to.

12:32.490 --> 12:34.101
You'll thank me later.
- Wait, what does that mean?

12:34.144 --> 12:35.276
- I know what it means!
[both shout]

12:35.319 --> 12:36.494
I heard you talking to Teddy

12:36.538 --> 12:37.669

you locked me in.

[soft chirping]
- [gasps] Mlepnos.

12:40.934 --> 12:42.065

the perfect goodbye.

12:42.109 --> 12:44.024
- Over my dead butt crack,
she is.

12:44.067 --> 12:45.329
Although, thank you,
that was a very nice thought.

Follow them.

12:52.902 --> 12:54.512

12:55.775 --> 12:57.080

it's close.

13:04.958 --> 13:06.481
Let's just agree
that we're gonna pick it up

13:06.524 --> 13:07.699
and head
to the Brooklyn Bridge.

13:07.743 --> 13:09.353
- Yeah, I agree.
That you can suck it!

13:09.397 --> 13:10.659
We will end up at Shaw's,

[tires screech, horn honks]

13:15.707 --> 13:17.144

Did you get the tube?

in this building.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.669
Brooklyn Storage Solutions.

13:20.712 --> 13:22.105
- Wait a second.

where we worked

with Captain Holt.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.718

it's a meaningful location.

Tonight is my victory lap.

13:28.895 --> 13:31.506

kidding me.

it wasn't that perfect.

for everyone?

13:43.823 --> 13:45.781
- Damn it!
Just tell us how you did it.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.348
- Everything hinged
on Jeffords.

13:47.391 --> 13:49.176
I needed him
to drop out of the heist

13:49.219 --> 13:51.134
so he'd have access
to everyone's secrets,

13:51.178 --> 13:53.006

a fake interview for him.

13:53.049 --> 13:54.485

with Williams?

13:54.529 --> 13:55.791
But he locked us in his office.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.314

gaining your trust

13:57.358 --> 13:58.707

where the tube was hidden.

14:03.625 --> 14:06.715
and handed it off to a person
who lured you all here

14:06.758 --> 14:08.456
and that person was a dog

and that dog was Cheddar.

That big speech about

14:12.155 --> 14:14.636
how I'd make a great captain,
that was all a lie?

it's exactly what I said

14:17.160 --> 14:18.509
to the real Williams
two weeks ago.

14:18.553 --> 14:21.338
It's part of the reason
he decided to make you...

14:21.382 --> 14:23.601
the new captain
of the Nine-Nine.

14:23.645 --> 14:25.734
- Wait, what?
Is this fake too?

14:25.777 --> 14:27.867
Y'all need to cut the [bleep]
and be honest with me.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.216
This is my life
we're talking about.

14:29.259 --> 14:30.173
- You want to know
if it's real?

14:30.217 --> 14:33.785
Open your gift and find out.

14:33.829 --> 14:35.352
- A bag of fish?
- What? No.

14:35.396 --> 14:36.658
It's supposed to be
your captain's bars.

14:36.701 --> 14:38.138
- The fish
are my present to Scully.

14:38.181 --> 14:39.791
They're the kind that eat
the dead skin off your feet.

14:39.835 --> 14:41.968
- Ooh, they're gonna have
a feast tonight.

14:42.011 --> 14:43.795
- But wait,
if that's not Terry's bars,

14:43.839 --> 14:44.927
what's in the real tube?

14:48.104 --> 14:50.237
Wireless headphones?
- They're AirPods.

14:50.280 --> 14:51.978
They're my gift for everyone.
- What?

14:52.021 --> 14:53.893
But you told me
not to get people AirPods!

14:53.936 --> 14:55.068
You said everyone
already has headphones!

14:55.111 --> 14:56.330
- Yeah,
so you wouldn't buy them

14:56.373 --> 14:57.940
and I would get all the glory.
- Wow.

14:57.984 --> 14:59.594
- Great gift, Amy.
- Come on!

14:59.637 --> 15:02.423
- But if I don't have
the winning tube, who does?

15:04.294 --> 15:05.382
- I do.

15:05.426 --> 15:08.124
- Yet another surprise
reveal again.

15:09.430 --> 15:11.084
- So, my plan was simple.

15:11.127 --> 15:12.476
The best way to win
is to sit back,

15:12.520 --> 15:14.348
watch everyone else,
and then choose your moment.

15:14.391 --> 15:16.176
But to do that, I needed people
to think I was gone.

15:16.219 --> 15:17.568
- It's a trick
she learned from me.

15:19.092 --> 15:20.397
[lisping]
During the fourth heist,

15:20.441 --> 15:22.051
universally considered
the best heist.

15:22.095 --> 15:23.357
- You were so eager to think

15:23.400 --> 15:24.967
I'd drop everything
and chase after Adrian.

15:25.011 --> 15:26.447
- So you don't want to end up
with Pimento?

15:26.490 --> 15:27.752
- No, but you believed it

15:27.796 --> 15:29.189
because you all think
for someone to be happy,

15:29.232 --> 15:30.842
their story has to end
with marriage and kids.

15:30.886 --> 15:33.584
- I mean, I believed it because
you told me and I trust you.

15:33.628 --> 15:34.716
- Whatever, breeder.

15:34.759 --> 15:35.978
Anyway, with nobody
watching me,

15:36.022 --> 15:37.414
I was able to figure out
what Holt was up to

15:37.458 --> 15:38.981
and then I had my other partner
intercept Cheddar.

15:39.025 --> 15:41.984
- Who was that?
- It's me, Bill.

15:42.028 --> 15:44.117
- Thurprithe reveal.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.945
- So, let's crown me.

15:45.988 --> 15:47.642
The Grand Champion
of the Nine-Nine.

15:47.685 --> 15:49.731
A six-month subscription
to the Rosetta Stone?

15:49.774 --> 15:50.993
- That's my present
for Peralta.

15:51.037 --> 15:52.908
- Your present to me is school?

15:52.952 --> 15:54.214
I'm glad you're leaving.

15:54.257 --> 15:55.824
- All right,
who has the real tube?

15:55.867 --> 15:57.304
- I do.

15:57.347 --> 15:59.349
[all shouting at once]
- What are you doing, Bill?

15:59.393 --> 16:01.961
- I'm sorry, but this is your
fault for ending the heists.

16:02.004 --> 16:03.310
They're my only source
of income.

16:03.353 --> 16:04.920
You're still my best friends.
Goodbye!

16:04.964 --> 16:06.878
- Bill!
- He's gone, we're trapped!

16:06.922 --> 16:08.402
- Pardon me, excuse me.

16:08.445 --> 16:10.317
Did you just say we're trapped?
- Who the hell are you?

16:10.360 --> 16:12.406
- You don't recognize
Caroline Saint-Jacques Renard?

16:12.449 --> 16:15.278
The associate principal cellist
for the Berlin Philharmonic?

16:15.322 --> 16:16.671
She's my surprise celebrity.

16:16.714 --> 16:17.846
- Are you kidding me?

16:17.889 --> 16:19.282
You ruined my big goodbye
to the Nine-Nine

16:19.326 --> 16:21.589
so we can listen to some nerd
play a giant violin?

16:21.632 --> 16:22.677
- Shall I begin?
- No.

16:22.720 --> 16:23.852
- Wait, wait, wait,

16:23.895 --> 16:26.855
did you say your goodbye
to the Nine-Nine?

16:26.898 --> 16:28.335
Where you going?

16:28.378 --> 16:30.902
- Uh, well,

16:30.946 --> 16:32.687
I was hoping that this would be

16:32.730 --> 16:37.170
a more dramatic moment
accompanied by fireworks but...

16:37.213 --> 16:39.041
I'm leaving the NYPD.
- You are?

16:39.085 --> 16:40.173
- What?
- Theriouthly?

16:40.216 --> 16:41.739
- For real?
- Yeah.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.132
Today was my last day.

16:43.176 --> 16:44.829
And now it looks like

16:44.873 --> 16:45.830
it's gonna end with all of us

16:45.874 --> 16:48.572
locked in a storage facility.

16:48.616 --> 16:51.097
- No, it's not.

16:51.140 --> 16:52.315
Can't you see?

16:52.359 --> 16:54.752
You all want the same thing,

16:54.796 --> 16:56.058
a perfect goodbye.

16:56.102 --> 16:58.147
But you're all getting
in each other's way.

16:58.191 --> 17:01.063
We are the Nine-Nine,

17:01.107 --> 17:03.065
and we work best together.

17:03.109 --> 17:04.719
And we're getting
out of here together.

17:04.762 --> 17:07.591
So we're gonna find that tube
and we're gonna be crowned

17:07.635 --> 17:10.768
Grand Champions
of the Nine-Nine together!

17:10.812 --> 17:13.206
- Except for the ugly one
that made fun of my cello.

17:13.249 --> 17:15.556
- Not now,
Caroline Saint-Jacques Renard.

17:15.599 --> 17:16.861
- I agree with Jeffords.

17:16.905 --> 17:18.428
Read the room,
Caroline Saint-Jacques Renard.

17:18.472 --> 17:19.908
- Great speech, Terry, but
we're kind of trapped in here.

17:19.951 --> 17:21.736
- Not for long.

17:21.779 --> 17:24.391
I'm gonna Kool-Aid Man us
the hell out of here.

17:24.434 --> 17:25.566
- I thought you said
that was impossible.

17:25.609 --> 17:27.611
- It's not,
I just find it demeaning.

17:27.655 --> 17:29.004
It's actually very easy.

17:29.048 --> 17:32.181
- Ah!

17:34.140 --> 17:36.011
[crashing]

17:36.055 --> 17:37.534
- Oh, yeah!

17:37.578 --> 17:40.233
- Oh, yes!
Now go through that wall!

17:40.276 --> 17:42.235
- I'm not doing any more walls,
Jake, we're free.

17:42.278 --> 17:43.366
- Fair enough, I had to ask.

17:43.410 --> 17:46.065
All right,
I got Bill on the GPS.

17:46.108 --> 17:47.283
Huh, that's weird.

17:47.327 --> 17:49.416
- What? Where'd he go?

17:49.459 --> 17:50.808
- Are you sure he came back
to the precinct?

17:50.852 --> 17:52.549
The tracker must be broken.
There's no one here.

17:52.593 --> 17:55.291
- Wrong, Captain!

17:55.335 --> 17:56.118
I'm here.

17:56.162 --> 17:57.250
Michael Hitchcock,

17:57.293 --> 18:00.601
the Grand Champion
of the Nine-Nine.

18:00.644 --> 18:01.602
- Hitchcock?

18:01.645 --> 18:04.344
- Well,
this doesn't feel right.

18:06.781 --> 18:06.955
.

18:06.998 --> 18:09.523
- I bet you're all wondering
how I pulled it off.

18:09.566 --> 18:10.524
- Not really, but I guess
that's the tradition.

18:10.567 --> 18:11.568
- The key to the whole plan

18:11.612 --> 18:13.004
was that I never really retired

18:13.048 --> 18:14.484
or moved to Brazil.

18:14.528 --> 18:16.573
I've been living in the
Beaver Trap this whole time.

18:16.617 --> 18:18.314
- Okay, but what was
the rest of the plan?

18:18.358 --> 18:19.533
- Oh, we had not
come up with it.

18:19.576 --> 18:20.838
- But then Bill came by
and offered

18:20.882 --> 18:23.624
to sell me the tube
for 40 bucks and I won.

18:23.667 --> 18:26.148
- Pretty good stuff.
- Now, crown me.

18:26.192 --> 18:27.671
- Ugh, this stinks.

18:27.715 --> 18:29.630
Okay, Michael Hitchcock,

18:29.673 --> 18:32.111
you are an amazing human/genius

18:32.154 --> 18:35.549
and the Grand Champion
of the Nine-Nine.

18:35.592 --> 18:36.854
Why is your head so sweaty?

18:36.898 --> 18:38.334
- Oh, because
that's actually butt skin

18:38.378 --> 18:40.380
from a botched hair transplant
so there are more pores.

18:40.423 --> 18:41.816
- I can't believe
this is how it ends,

18:41.859 --> 18:43.426
with Hitchcock's
sweaty butt head.

18:43.470 --> 18:44.949
- I told myself I wouldn't cry.

18:44.993 --> 18:46.473
- Ah, Jake,
I'm sorry you didn't get

18:46.516 --> 18:48.692
your perfect goodbye.
- Yeah.

18:48.736 --> 18:50.303
This whole thing
did kinda turn into

18:50.346 --> 18:52.000
a scalding hot mess.

18:52.043 --> 18:54.176
But to be honest,

18:54.220 --> 18:55.786
I think I just wanted
a big dramatic moment

18:55.830 --> 18:57.571
so that I wouldn't feel sad.

18:57.614 --> 19:00.574
Because goodbyes
are inherently sad.

19:00.617 --> 19:02.228
They mean
that something's ending.

19:02.271 --> 19:03.794
And this one is especially sad

19:03.838 --> 19:05.883
because what we had
was so great.

19:05.927 --> 19:08.799
But it's not all sad, right?

19:08.843 --> 19:10.540
We're moving on
to things that we love.

19:10.584 --> 19:12.151
And we'll always have

19:12.194 --> 19:14.457
the memories
of our times together,

19:14.501 --> 19:15.589
even though Hitchcock
won the heist,

19:15.632 --> 19:16.764
which makes me so mad

19:16.807 --> 19:18.505
I wanna swallow
my own tongue and die.

19:18.548 --> 19:20.768
- It's a disgrace.
- Anyways,

19:20.811 --> 19:23.379
I say we hang out,
have a drink,

19:23.423 --> 19:25.686
and enjoy all of us
being together one last time.

19:27.688 --> 19:28.993
To the squad.

19:29.037 --> 19:29.994
all: To the squad.

19:31.474 --> 19:34.042
- You just drank cement!

19:34.085 --> 19:35.609
- Why?

19:36.914 --> 19:38.220
- Hey, can I talk to you
for a sec?

19:38.264 --> 19:40.744
I just want you to know
that I don't care

19:40.788 --> 19:43.617
if you end up with anyone
or get married or whatever.

19:43.660 --> 19:45.271
I just want you to be happy.

19:45.314 --> 19:46.620
- I am happy.

19:46.663 --> 19:48.230
I'm making a difference,
I've got great friends.

19:48.274 --> 19:50.189
Also, I'm moving in
with my girlfriend, Debra.

19:50.232 --> 19:52.278
She is amazing.
She makes me feel whole.

19:52.321 --> 19:53.279
- Oh, really?

19:53.322 --> 19:54.932
- Oh, my God, this is too easy.

19:54.976 --> 19:56.369
No, I don't want
to settle down.

19:56.412 --> 19:57.979
- Right. I'm sorry, sorry.

19:58.022 --> 20:00.590
- It's fine.
I'm just messing with you.

20:00.634 --> 20:03.202
It's crazy you're leaving.

20:03.245 --> 20:04.464
We spent a lot of time here.

20:04.507 --> 20:06.205
- Yeah, we did.

20:08.076 --> 20:10.470
I'm really happy
it was with you.

20:10.513 --> 20:12.211
- Same here.

20:12.254 --> 20:14.691
I love you.

20:14.735 --> 20:16.476
- I love you too.

20:16.519 --> 20:17.868
[glasses clink]

20:17.912 --> 20:19.957
- Hey, Boyle, I'm glad
you're sticking around.

20:20.001 --> 20:21.829
I'm gonna be
depending on you a lot.

20:21.872 --> 20:24.092
- You got it, Captain,
for diet and exercise tips.

20:24.135 --> 20:25.659
- What? No.

20:25.702 --> 20:27.704
To solve cases. My body's fine.

20:27.748 --> 20:29.750
- Nice,
that's a very healthy attitude.

20:29.793 --> 20:32.318
- Hey, guys, can I be real?

20:32.361 --> 20:35.277
I just took a bunch of diamonds
from the evidence locker.

20:35.321 --> 20:37.279
No one ever changed the code.

20:37.323 --> 20:39.281
Anyway, toodaloo.

20:40.543 --> 20:41.762
- Was she being real?

20:41.805 --> 20:43.546
- I honestly can't tell.

20:43.590 --> 20:44.765
- I missed you, bud.

20:44.808 --> 20:46.723
- I missed you too.

20:48.812 --> 20:50.727
- [sniffs] Mmm.

20:50.771 --> 20:52.947
You got wing sauce
on your collar.

20:52.990 --> 20:56.124
- I left it there for you.

20:58.257 --> 21:01.738
- So, you're leaving.

21:03.131 --> 21:04.524
That must've been
a hard decision.

21:04.567 --> 21:06.134
- Honestly...

21:09.790 --> 21:11.661
It wasn't.
- It's funny.

21:11.705 --> 21:13.184
On my first day here,

21:13.228 --> 21:15.926
I asked Jeffords
to tell me about everyone.

21:15.970 --> 21:17.928
He told me you were
a great detective,

21:17.972 --> 21:19.713
but the one thing
you couldn't figure out

21:19.756 --> 21:22.281
was how to grow up.

21:22.324 --> 21:24.587
Well...

21:24.631 --> 21:26.023
I think you've finally
figured it out.

21:29.331 --> 21:30.680
- Well, thank you, sir.

21:30.724 --> 21:32.073
I couldn't have done it
without you.

21:32.116 --> 21:33.727
- Over the years,
you've sometimes referred to me

21:33.770 --> 21:35.119
as something
of a father figure.

21:35.163 --> 21:36.512
- Did I? I didn't realize that.

21:36.556 --> 21:37.861
- But I want you to know

21:37.905 --> 21:40.516
if I had had a son

21:40.560 --> 21:45.913
and, uh,
he had turned out like you,

21:45.956 --> 21:47.784
I would be very proud of him.

21:53.790 --> 21:56.097
- Thank you, sir.

21:56.140 --> 21:58.012
Wow.

21:58.055 --> 22:00.101
Wasn't expecting
to get this emotional.

22:00.144 --> 22:02.364
- It's not bad
for an old robot, huh?

22:02.408 --> 22:04.366
Beep-borp. Zeep.

22:04.410 --> 22:05.933
- [chuckles]

22:05.976 --> 22:08.588
Sir, did you just make a joke?
- I believe I did, yes.

22:08.631 --> 22:09.850
I guess in the end,

22:09.893 --> 22:13.244
we rubbed off on each other
quite a bit.

22:13.288 --> 22:15.769
Title of your sex movie.
