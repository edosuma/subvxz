00:36.549 --> 00:39.194
<i>Yeah, are you still at work or what?</i>

00:40.315 --> 00:41.561
<i>Right.</i>

00:46.248 --> 00:50.427
Well, you know, hon...
I've got to go. I've got to go.

00:51.515 --> 00:53.416
Got some work to do.

00:53.516 --> 00:56.561
Right. I love you, too.

01:32.982 --> 01:35.216
- You can't do this.
- I don't have a choice.

01:35.316 --> 01:37.127
You can't do this, man.

02:14.282 --> 02:17.327
Right there. Right there, Davis.

02:18.549 --> 02:21.194
Yeah. Yeah, there you are.

02:24.916 --> 02:28.327
Looks like a size eight. Probably a teenager.

02:29.348 --> 02:31.227
He's alone.

02:32.415 --> 02:35.861
Okay. Let's go. That way.

02:39.115 --> 02:40.882
So the guy pulls a gun, and he says...

02:40.982 --> 02:43.982
"I didn't come for your gold.
I came for the justice."

02:44.082 --> 02:46.982
And then the wagon blew up.
Blah, ba-blah, ba-blah.

02:47.082 --> 02:51.383
They leave these movies open for sequels
all the time, and that's the problem.

02:51.483 --> 02:54.183
They just want to make more money.
It was a terrible movie.

02:54.283 --> 02:56.448
- The girl at least like it?
- The girl? What girl?

02:56.548 --> 02:58.617
The girl, the one that you said
you were meeting from El Paso.

02:58.717 --> 03:01.316
Oh, my God. That was a complete bust.

03:01.416 --> 03:04.082
I ended up seeing
the fucking movie by myself.

03:04.182 --> 03:05.216
- What?
- Yeah.

03:05.316 --> 03:08.491
The second I pull up, she gets in the car,
she starts talking about champagne.

03:08.591 --> 03:11.150
"Champagne, I wanna taste some.
I wanna try champagne tonight."

03:11.250 --> 03:14.383
You think there's anywhere in this fucking
bullshit town that sells champagne?

03:14.483 --> 03:16.082
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:16.182 --> 03:18.427
- Hey, what?
- Hold on.

03:18.981 --> 03:20.960
What's the matter?

03:21.548 --> 03:23.426
He stopped.

03:27.015 --> 03:28.494
Hmm.

03:30.648 --> 03:33.985
- What are you seeing here?
- Well, he stopped there...

03:34.085 --> 03:36.026
...and he's shuffling.

03:36.948 --> 03:38.700
Indentation is deeper here on this edge...

03:38.800 --> 03:42.093
...so he probably switched the bag
over to the other shoulder.

03:42.582 --> 03:45.616
- Which probably means he's gonna start...
- It means he's turning left.

03:45.716 --> 03:49.410
- Nice.
- Yeah. See? I'm listening, man.

03:49.510 --> 03:52.183
- I am. I'm learning.
- Hobbs ain't gonna believe it.

03:52.283 --> 03:55.360
I don't believe it, either.
I can't believe I can do this.

04:24.281 --> 04:26.611
What? What is it?

04:45.181 --> 04:47.073
What the shit is that?

04:48.148 --> 04:50.183
The kid's definitely a drug mule.

04:50.782 --> 04:52.785
Not sure which cartel, though.

04:53.583 --> 04:57.283
I didn't know these things were real.
I thought those were just stories.

04:57.383 --> 04:59.640
It's not just a Hobbs story.

05:00.549 --> 05:03.665
They do this for safe passage
across the desert.

05:03.765 --> 05:05.812
Looks like he brushed out.

05:12.848 --> 05:15.440
Hey, hey, hey. Don't touch it.

05:17.981 --> 05:21.415
What, you think I'm gonna get possessed
by demons or something?

05:21.515 --> 05:24.772
- I'm just saying.
- I'll touch it.

05:44.615 --> 05:46.440
Good Lord.

05:53.382 --> 05:56.682
I see you girls finished playing
grab-ass out there.

05:56.782 --> 05:59.240
Decided to come out here and help me.

05:59.881 --> 06:03.283
We almost had him, Hobbsy. I was right there.

06:03.383 --> 06:06.316
What happened? He outrun you or something?

06:06.416 --> 06:10.483
No, he, uh, started at the wall,
started bearing left. Davis caught it.

06:10.583 --> 06:12.606
Miracle of God.

06:12.881 --> 06:14.704
Yeah, then he brushed out.

06:16.515 --> 06:18.939
Kid got to see his first shrine, though.

06:19.415 --> 06:22.149
- You didn't touch it, did you?
- See, that's what Flores said.

06:22.249 --> 06:26.482
Y'all are too superstitious.
I don't know what you're talking about.

06:26.582 --> 06:30.948
- See any action while we were gone?
- No, just a car full of frat boys.

06:31.048 --> 06:33.051
Forgot how to get back.

06:33.550 --> 06:36.221
Looked like they had a pretty
rough time down there, so...

06:36.321 --> 06:38.536
...I didn't mess with them too much.

06:39.081 --> 06:40.883
Still early, though.

06:41.781 --> 06:46.006
I hate to say it, but I don't think
we're gonna see much out here today.

06:48.515 --> 06:50.349
I don't know, Flores.

06:51.882 --> 06:54.149
It was the sound of that wind that...

06:54.249 --> 06:57.286
...brought me here to set up
this point this morning.

06:59.116 --> 07:02.416
Do you remember what Old Louise
used to say about that?

07:02.516 --> 07:06.518
- Yeah, it's how she found you.
- That's right.

07:06.916 --> 07:08.939
Hold on. We got something.

07:11.282 --> 07:13.284
Time to earn your money, boys.

07:13.782 --> 07:15.873
Let's see what you got, Junior.

07:32.482 --> 07:34.982
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

07:35.082 --> 07:37.416
Turn your car off for me for a minute.

07:37.516 --> 07:41.339
- Thank you. You a U.S. citizen?
- Yes, sir.

07:41.681 --> 07:43.882
Hmm. Where are you heading?

07:43.982 --> 07:48.418
I work on Mr. Copeland's ranch off 617.

07:48.766 --> 07:51.239
I'm going into town to get some alfalfa.

07:51.931 --> 07:54.390
Can I see some identification, please?

08:04.598 --> 08:06.867
All right, Mr. Ferrara.

08:07.516 --> 08:09.730
You buying anything else
that looks like alfalfa?

08:10.681 --> 08:12.540
Um, no, sir.

08:13.748 --> 08:17.582
- Good. Thank you. You have a nice day.
- Boy, you're forgetting more than I know.

08:17.682 --> 08:21.481
Did you expect this checkpoint
to be here today, Mr. Ferrara?

08:21.581 --> 08:24.082
- Excuse me, sir?
- Did you expect this checkpoint...

08:24.182 --> 08:26.806
Thank you, sir. You're free to go.

08:30.348 --> 08:33.206
Please. Thank you for your cooperation.

08:35.948 --> 08:37.938
Thank you, sir.

08:38.048 --> 08:39.506
Mmm-hmm.

08:49.181 --> 08:51.082
That's the kind of mood you're in?

08:51.182 --> 08:53.149
That's Alberto, man.

08:53.249 --> 08:57.339
I know that's Alberto, and this is my point.

08:59.515 --> 09:01.015
Forget it.

09:01.115 --> 09:04.583
- All right, 3-2. You ready, Davis?
- No. No, wait. Hold up.

09:07.515 --> 09:10.172
Mickey Mantle, here you go. Watch this.

09:10.315 --> 09:13.083
There you go. We got 4-2.

09:13.183 --> 09:16.315
That's a double. We got a ghost man
on second. Go ahead.

09:16.415 --> 09:19.106
Oh, swing, batter, batter.

09:20.032 --> 09:21.866
Go, man! One more.

09:21.966 --> 09:23.731
Come on.

09:23.831 --> 09:27.992
Stop the car. Stop the car. Okay, keep going.

09:28.092 --> 09:29.972
Go up to him.

09:31.814 --> 09:35.849
- What are you stopping for, sir?
- Sir, he asked me to stop.

09:35.949 --> 09:39.843
You guys saw it when I made him stop and
then come up? No, you didn't see that?

09:39.943 --> 09:41.367
- Dickhead.
- I did see that. I did.

09:41.467 --> 09:43.949
- That was funny. Come on.
- I pay attention.

09:44.049 --> 09:45.549
"Hey, stop. Okay, keep going."

09:45.649 --> 09:47.648
Just fuck with them.
I'm so fucking bored out here.

09:47.748 --> 09:50.639
- Cone Olympics.
- Cone Olympics. I got it.

09:52.348 --> 09:54.682
- Here, I got you a chair, Hobbs.
- Yeah.

09:54.782 --> 09:56.916
- Here's a chair for you.
- That's cute. That's cute, boys.

09:57.016 --> 09:58.882
If you don't wanna play Cone Olympics,
just have a seat.

09:58.982 --> 10:01.881
If he sits down,
he won't be able to get back up.

10:01.981 --> 10:03.382
Ready?

10:18.115 --> 10:21.749
So these shotguns are sticking out the back
of one of the vans, and boom, boom!

10:21.849 --> 10:23.716
They start dumping hot lead on us...

10:23.816 --> 10:26.149
...all the while cutting across
through the onion field...

10:26.249 --> 10:29.582
...heading down to Canyon Road
straight for the border.

10:29.682 --> 10:34.782
Now, old Shepherd, he's driving. It's long
before he was stuck doing all that desk duty.

10:34.882 --> 10:37.749
He managed to get us
right up behind that vehicle.

10:37.849 --> 10:43.049
I lean out, and with this pistol...
one shot, that tire's shredded.

10:43.149 --> 10:46.815
And this van flips over and topples
down into the canyon.

10:46.915 --> 10:50.649
We head down there, and there's all
these kangaroos standing around.

10:50.749 --> 10:53.982
These wetbacks were smuggling
kangaroos in a van into Mexico.

10:54.082 --> 10:58.183
- Come on, man.
- Well, they shot first.

10:58.283 --> 11:00.140
- It's not what I'm saying.
- I'm serious.

11:00.240 --> 11:02.766
You go down there, you can still find
kangaroos if you know where to look.

11:02.866 --> 11:04.916
- Let me finish?
- Okay, fine. Go ahead.

11:05.016 --> 11:08.482
Just stop, please. Just stop
saying "wetbacks" altogether.

11:08.582 --> 11:11.013
Come on. "Wetbacks," "back scratches."
It don't matter to me...

11:11.113 --> 11:13.717
...knowing they swim over or crawl under.

11:14.316 --> 11:17.140
Back when I got started, it wasn't so PC.

11:17.881 --> 11:20.571
It was either "wets" or "tonks."

11:21.115 --> 11:24.083
- And do you call your kids that?
- What?

11:24.183 --> 11:26.741
Do you call your kids "wetbacks"
and "tonks"? Do you say it like...

11:26.841 --> 11:29.415
"Hey, tonk, go to the bathroom,"
or, "Come eat your food, tonk," or...

11:29.515 --> 11:31.749
- You watch it.
- All right.

11:31.849 --> 11:34.749
It's different. I'm talking
about bona fide criminals here.

11:34.849 --> 11:37.882
- All right, all right. Let's drop it.
- No, no, no. Come on, now.

11:37.982 --> 11:40.182
How about that little kid
you was tracking earlier?

11:40.282 --> 11:42.582
I mean, can we call them "drug mules..."

11:42.682 --> 11:44.949
...or is that gonna offend
your delicate sensibilities?

11:45.049 --> 11:48.449
No, of course. I mean, sure.
Yeah, they're mules.

11:48.549 --> 11:51.769
- But they're still little boys underneath it.
- Uh-uh, no, sir.

11:51.869 --> 11:56.382
That all changed when they picked up
that AK, decided to become soldiers...

11:56.482 --> 11:58.772
...and they will be treated as such.

12:00.082 --> 12:04.282
Well, I just wanna know,
just for clarification...

12:04.382 --> 12:07.082
...just so we can get
all the terminology right...

12:07.182 --> 12:10.749
...do you want us to call you
an "asshole" or a "douche"?

12:10.849 --> 12:14.072
'Cause you're both of them,
and I wanna get it right.

12:17.514 --> 12:21.206
- "Mr. Asshole."
- Mr. Asshole, got you.

12:25.614 --> 12:29.505
You'll see. I'm gonna get me some coffee.

12:30.347 --> 12:33.550
Well, lookie here, my lucky day.

12:35.514 --> 12:37.806
I'm gonna let you boys handle this.

12:38.381 --> 12:40.682
Careful what words you use now.

12:40.782 --> 12:43.248
Hey, let me get this one.
I need a little wake-me-up.

12:43.348 --> 12:46.172
I'm getting bored, listening to Hobbs' story.

12:53.414 --> 12:56.248
Good afternoon, sir. You a U.S. citizen?

12:56.348 --> 12:57.869
- I am.
- Yeah?

12:57.969 --> 13:00.248
Can you go ahead and turn your car off,
put it in park, please?

13:00.348 --> 13:02.606
Grab your ID while you're at it.

13:04.614 --> 13:06.505
Here you go.

13:07.381 --> 13:08.549
Hang tight a minute.

13:08.649 --> 13:10.448
- This your vehicle?
- Yes, sir.

13:10.548 --> 13:11.649
- Flores.
- Yeah.

13:11.749 --> 13:13.448
- For you.
- Who is it?

13:13.548 --> 13:16.315
- Someone asking for Lance.
- Where are you heading?

13:16.415 --> 13:19.295
- Who has this number?
- Beats me.

13:19.614 --> 13:20.915
Good.

13:21.015 --> 13:23.016
- Where are you coming from?
- Down Terlingua.

13:23.116 --> 13:24.778
- Terlingua? Where are you heading?
- Alpine.

13:24.878 --> 13:28.049
Alpine. All right, you have yourself
a nice day, sir. Thank you.

13:28.149 --> 13:30.415
Whoa, hold on, Davis.

13:30.515 --> 13:33.549
Hobbs, I got it. I got it.
I already checked him out.

13:33.649 --> 13:36.872
- Where are you going?
- Just heading home to Alpine.

13:37.481 --> 13:41.082
- Where are you coming from?
- Down Terlingua. My cousin lives down there.

13:41.182 --> 13:42.882
He was a little sick,
so I was bringing him groceries.

13:42.982 --> 13:45.415
- What the fuck is this?
- That's very nice.

13:45.515 --> 13:49.315
Did you forget your house keys,
or did you put those somewhere else?

13:49.415 --> 13:50.449
Excuse me. I...

13:50.549 --> 13:54.181
I was just noticing that there weren't
any house keys on your key-ring there.

13:54.281 --> 13:56.505
Now, I was just wondering.

13:57.048 --> 13:59.582
Yeah, I keep them in the glove box.
I can show them to you.

13:59.682 --> 14:01.549
- No, no, that's all right.
- Okay.

14:01.649 --> 14:04.049
Hobbs, who is this lady? She's insane.

14:04.149 --> 14:06.039
Hold up.

14:06.981 --> 14:10.615
Sir, shut off the vehicle.
Shut off the vehicle now!

14:36.014 --> 14:37.522
Hobbs!

14:38.781 --> 14:40.607
Hobbs!

14:43.614 --> 14:45.439
He busted my wing.

14:49.681 --> 14:51.505
How's my buddy?

14:52.264 --> 14:54.122
I haven't asked him.

14:57.448 --> 15:01.739
All right, look, I need to secure
your weapon, okay? Loosen that grip.

15:11.347 --> 15:16.006
What's the matter with him? Acts like
he ain't never seen a dead body before.

15:16.414 --> 15:18.450
He hasn't, not a fresh one.

15:18.949 --> 15:23.734
Davis! Davis, go to the truck so you can
find something to make a sling with.

15:23.834 --> 15:25.706
Water, too.

15:27.614 --> 15:31.816
- We're gonna have to get you to the hospital.
- Nope, I ain't going anywhere...

15:31.916 --> 15:34.939
...till I see what that joker was carrying.

15:37.814 --> 15:40.039
Hey, Omaha. Let's go.

15:40.481 --> 15:43.772
- It's all I could find.
- That's perfect.

15:46.681 --> 15:48.522
All right.

15:50.380 --> 15:52.649
I got to touch your arm, okay?

15:54.348 --> 15:56.648
- Oh, you big baby.
- Oh, shut it.

15:56.748 --> 15:58.572
Water.

16:02.347 --> 16:03.982
- Hey, you all right?
- Huh?

16:04.082 --> 16:05.849
- You okay?
- Yeah, no, I'm fine.

16:05.949 --> 16:08.806
I'm just worried about Hobbs.

16:09.881 --> 16:12.889
I already said it.
I ain't laying up in some hospital bed.

16:12.989 --> 16:17.281
I wanna know what's so special
about this vehicle. I ain't doing it.

16:17.381 --> 16:19.239
You heard the man.

16:19.981 --> 16:22.183
Let's get you up. Come on.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.039
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:26.147 --> 16:29.006
- You up?
- I don't need both of yous.

16:33.248 --> 16:37.315
Hey, Flores! Flores, you can't touch this.
It's a crime scene now.

16:37.415 --> 16:40.872
We're all right.
Just a quick look under the hood.

16:42.547 --> 16:45.039
Holy shit.

16:51.180 --> 16:53.072
Head to tail, Davis.

16:53.581 --> 16:57.072
- Check the doors if you're up to it.
- I'm up to it.

16:58.381 --> 17:00.916
You know it's going
to be in the tail, Flores.

17:01.016 --> 17:03.105
Oh, don't rob me of the fun part.

17:20.080 --> 17:23.214
Hey, Flores, there's a firearm up here.
I'm gonna secure it.

17:23.315 --> 17:24.739
Copy.

17:29.514 --> 17:31.339
Cab's clear.

17:40.647 --> 17:43.215
- Nothing yet?
- Nope.

18:09.548 --> 18:12.405
He look like he worked
at Pizza Palace to you?

18:37.948 --> 18:40.372
Definitely worth staying for.

18:51.781 --> 18:54.682
How much do you think that is, 150 pounds?

18:54.782 --> 18:58.248
That's worth millions of dollars.
Shit, 10 maybe.

18:58.348 --> 19:02.439
Man, never thought I'd see
cocaine come through here.

19:03.014 --> 19:05.449
Told you something was gonna
happen today, didn't I?

19:05.549 --> 19:09.514
- Oh, yeah.
- Felt it. What's the matter, kid?

19:09.614 --> 19:12.353
- Not enough for you?
- No, I just...

19:12.453 --> 19:15.932
...I didn't know that that could
all fit in that little car.

19:17.499 --> 19:20.439
It ain't the strangest place
I've seen shit smuggled.

19:22.848 --> 19:25.071
Impressive, fellows.

19:26.848 --> 19:28.739
We did good today.

19:29.848 --> 19:31.694
Just call the cavalry...

19:31.794 --> 19:34.682
...get some trophy photo,
and get this whole mess cleaned up.

19:34.782 --> 19:37.071
Hey, call this in, Davis.

19:38.848 --> 19:40.272
Hey.

19:41.415 --> 19:44.455
Come on, man, I know
you've seen that at the academy.

19:46.647 --> 19:48.539
I can't do that.

19:51.981 --> 19:54.238
Quit screwing around, man. Just...

19:57.247 --> 19:59.105
I can't call it in.

20:02.481 --> 20:04.938
What do you mean, you can't call it in?

20:07.381 --> 20:09.549
Well, screw it. I'll do it.

20:09.649 --> 20:14.122
Hey, take your hand off your radio
for a minute. Just listen to me.

20:16.347 --> 20:18.205
Fuck you doing, boy?

20:22.080 --> 20:24.772
If these don't make it
to where they're going...

20:25.747 --> 20:29.649
...I'm dead. My whole fucking family is dead.

20:29.749 --> 20:33.118
- Are you joking?
- What the hell? I knew something was up.

20:33.218 --> 20:35.684
- Cut it out. Cut that shit out.
- I'm not joking. I'm not joking.

20:35.784 --> 20:39.114
- You cut this shit out right now.
- I'm not fucking around right now!

20:39.214 --> 20:41.362
You think I'm fucking around right now?

20:41.462 --> 20:44.015
You're gonna take one hand,
move it very slowly.

20:44.115 --> 20:46.781
- Your right hand, grab your pistol.
- All right, calm down.

20:46.881 --> 20:49.215
- Don't make any fucking movements.
- All right, all right.

20:49.315 --> 20:52.005
Okay? Now kick it over to me, very softly.

20:53.514 --> 20:56.082
- I got Hobbs's gun, okay?
- I know exactly where it is.

20:56.182 --> 20:59.838
- Very slowly. Don't you fucking move.
- Right here.

21:00.647 --> 21:03.339
Kick it over to me. Now get back.

21:04.447 --> 21:08.472
Okay, radios. I want your radio.
I want your radio.

21:09.214 --> 21:12.072
- You're gonna get Hobbs's radio.
- Fuck!

21:14.080 --> 21:15.981
Right there.

21:16.081 --> 21:17.938
I'm going over.

21:23.813 --> 21:25.272
There.

21:28.147 --> 21:30.773
Okay, now listen to me.

21:34.147 --> 21:37.148
I fucked up, okay?

21:37.547 --> 21:39.982
I fucked up big, all right?

21:40.082 --> 21:42.748
But this wasn't supposed to happen.
None of this was supposed to happen.

21:42.848 --> 21:46.415
The only thing I knew, was that
this car was not supposed to be stopped.

21:46.515 --> 21:48.415
- Where they going?
- I don't know.

21:48.515 --> 21:51.482
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- What do you think he means?

21:51.582 --> 21:56.506
- This shit is not happening, man.
- What are you expecting us to do?

21:58.681 --> 22:00.245
Davis...

22:00.892 --> 22:04.516
...now you listen to me.
As far as anybody is concerned...

22:04.616 --> 22:09.368
...we just busted a major load of drugs,
okay? We're still doing our jobs.

22:09.468 --> 22:12.515
Now, we call this in. We let them know
there's been threats on your life.

22:12.615 --> 22:14.982
They'll transfer you out.
You are protected, all right?

22:15.082 --> 22:18.081
No. They're gonna fucking protect me?
They couldn't protect me before.

22:18.181 --> 22:20.615
How the fuck are they gonna
protect me now? Huh?

22:20.715 --> 22:22.272
Davis.

22:23.047 --> 22:24.938
Put these on.

22:25.381 --> 22:28.875
- Put one on Hobbs. Be careful with his arm.
- You shitless coward.

22:28.975 --> 22:32.582
This wouldn't be fucking happening
if you'd just let me do my goddamn job!

22:32.682 --> 22:36.272
This isn't happening. You're doing this.

22:38.747 --> 22:39.781
Come on, Davis.

22:39.881 --> 22:42.748
You know exactly what happens
when you get marked by the cartel.

22:42.848 --> 22:47.848
- That shit doesn't go away. You seen it.
- I have. That's why we call it in now.

22:47.948 --> 22:52.425
It's only gonna get fucked up from here,
all right? Think about it. Let me help you.

22:53.747 --> 22:58.415
- Let me help you.
- No, no, no. It's too late for all that.

23:32.913 --> 23:37.945
46123, 46123, 46123.

23:38.481 --> 23:40.841
- Don't tell him anything.
- 46123.

23:40.941 --> 23:43.281
- It's a coordinate.
- Shut up.

23:43.381 --> 23:45.349
- What'd you say?
- That's a coordinate.

23:45.449 --> 23:48.509
You're goddamn right,
it's a coordinate. Go fuck yourself.

23:48.609 --> 23:51.449
Go. Go. We're giving you
an hour head start. Go.

23:51.549 --> 23:53.915
No. Are you not hearing me?
It's too fucking late for that.

23:54.015 --> 23:56.182
The second I let you go,
you know exactly what you're gonna do.

23:56.282 --> 23:59.415
- You're gonna call me in on an arrest.
- Yes, that's why you need to disappear...

23:59.515 --> 24:01.248
...'cause every agent in the Southwest
is coming after you.

24:01.348 --> 24:03.382
You don't think I fucking know that?

24:03.482 --> 24:06.048
But from the moment this asshole
pulled this car over to secondary...

24:06.148 --> 24:10.614
...my family's throats are slit. Me, too,
so now we're all fucking in this together.

24:10.714 --> 24:12.738
So get in the fucking truck.

24:15.548 --> 24:18.605
Get in the fucking truck.
Don't fuck with me right now.

24:19.147 --> 24:20.671
All right.

24:21.381 --> 24:24.862
Hobbs, you think I'm fucking around?
Think I'm fucking around?

24:24.962 --> 24:28.249
I got him, man. I got him. Stop it.
I got him. Come on. Let's go.

24:28.349 --> 24:31.439
- Get in the fucking truck, Hobbs.
- We're going. We're going.

24:36.980 --> 24:39.581
All right, all right.

24:39.681 --> 24:43.539
Now, don't do any... nothing funny, okay?

24:46.414 --> 24:48.855
Smells like piss back here.

24:52.047 --> 24:54.648
What the hell are you thinking?

24:54.748 --> 24:57.915
I'll turn you in just as quick
for helping that little shit.

24:58.015 --> 25:01.315
Just calm down, all right?
I just need to think a second.

25:01.415 --> 25:02.748
"Think"?

25:02.848 --> 25:07.422
If you're trying to calculate
prison time, I can help you there.

25:09.147 --> 25:10.616
Look...

25:11.015 --> 25:15.514
...I ain't gonna see that kid get his
head bashed in with a pipe wrench...

25:15.614 --> 25:17.472
...not on my watch.

25:17.914 --> 25:20.150
Don't you talk to me about that.

25:20.748 --> 25:23.781
Mike made his decision. He made it.

25:23.881 --> 25:27.771
Just like Davis made his. You got that?

25:38.314 --> 25:40.381
Just think about it.

25:40.579 --> 25:42.947
You saw this load in that car.

25:43.047 --> 25:45.472
Think about what Davis could lead us to.

25:46.080 --> 25:48.814
I want that guy out of that uniform...

25:48.914 --> 25:51.715
...on the ground, in the dirt, cuffed...

25:51.815 --> 25:55.049
...so that I can drag him
to the place that he needs to go.

25:55.348 --> 25:59.514
And any other noise
that's around me is just noise.

25:59.614 --> 26:04.038
I could give a damn on whether
he knows where that drop is or not.

26:10.847 --> 26:14.339
- How's your arm?
- It's broken, you asshole.

26:16.580 --> 26:18.472
Look, you don't worry, Hobbs.

26:19.481 --> 26:23.088
Couple more hours,
it's going to be your best story yet.

26:23.188 --> 26:27.638
I could do without this story.
I really could.

26:33.613 --> 26:35.148
- Jesus!
- Whoa!

26:35.248 --> 26:37.581
- Didn't I tell you to stay in the truck?
- Easy.

26:37.681 --> 26:41.548
- I said to stay in the truck, didn't I?
- Easy, Davis. Easy, okay?

26:41.648 --> 26:43.981
All right, just listen, all right?

26:44.081 --> 26:47.139
That's a big desert out there,
and you only got half a coordinate.

26:48.513 --> 26:51.515
Now, untie me.
It's gonna all be over quicker.

26:51.615 --> 26:55.349
Flores, didn't I fucking tell you
to stay in the goddamn truck?

26:55.449 --> 26:58.671
I heard you, but you're forgetting
something already, Davis.

26:58.980 --> 27:02.581
There's a shift change
in 15 minutes, you dumbass.

27:02.681 --> 27:06.771
You got a body sunbathing
in the front of that car.

27:09.880 --> 27:11.905
You can't find it by yourself.

27:18.697 --> 27:20.705
Just cut me loose.

27:25.381 --> 27:27.747
I'm gonna cut you loose, okay?

27:27.847 --> 27:31.138
- Okay.
- But don't you fucking move.

27:32.180 --> 27:34.604
- Don't move!
- I ain't.

27:36.446 --> 27:38.305
Reach them out to me.

27:49.080 --> 27:50.971
Got that map?

27:52.214 --> 27:53.772
Yeah.

28:04.580 --> 28:06.049
Right there.

28:06.149 --> 28:08.314
That's not a road.
There's no road that goes fucking there.

28:08.414 --> 28:11.149
- Those aren't fucking coordinates.
- I know.

28:11.249 --> 28:13.317
It's just old dirt roads.

28:14.015 --> 28:16.072
You only know them if you've been there.

28:18.613 --> 28:21.072
Flores, hey, look at me.

28:25.347 --> 28:27.839
Don't you fuck me, okay?

28:29.330 --> 28:31.189
Don't fuck me.

28:43.814 --> 28:46.982
It's gonna start smelling soon.
You don't have long before people notice.

28:47.082 --> 28:49.481
If they don't, the buzzards will. Let's go.

28:49.581 --> 28:52.205
Can't think about that right now.
We've got to go.

29:12.064 --> 29:13.922
They should be here already.

29:22.513 --> 29:25.480
How do I know you're not gonna sell me out?

29:25.580 --> 29:27.404
You don't.

29:30.814 --> 29:33.714
Just better hope that they're
not paying attention to me.

29:33.814 --> 29:36.829
- Why? What do you mean?
- I'm not wearing my pistol...

29:37.927 --> 29:39.804
...or radio.

29:58.980 --> 30:01.715
They're gonna ask about Hobbs.
You need to come up with something.

30:01.815 --> 30:04.515
Well, you seem to have a pretty
good hand on that hide-in-plain-sight...

30:04.615 --> 30:08.238
Flores, I told you, all right?
I already told you.

30:08.613 --> 30:12.115
It's not just me. They have everybody.
They know everything about me.

30:12.215 --> 30:16.638
They said that they'd kill my entire family,
my sister up in Colorado, my dad.

30:23.346 --> 30:25.581
They even sent me a picture
of my mom at the post office.

30:25.681 --> 30:28.152
You tell me what the fuck you would do.

30:38.614 --> 30:41.681
- What up, boy?
- If you sell me out, my mom's dead.

30:41.781 --> 30:45.608
- How goes it, fellows?
- How are you guys doing?

30:46.214 --> 30:48.219
It's a beater today, ain't it?

30:49.246 --> 30:52.848
I think I've lost about five pounds.
Ain't that right, Hendricks?

30:52.948 --> 30:56.414
- At least I got the hot dogs!
- Yeah, and a pitcher of Louise's sweet tea.

30:56.514 --> 30:59.314
Yeah, well, I wouldn't expect
anything less from you two.

30:59.414 --> 31:02.188
Hey, you've got to make
the best of BFE shifts.

31:02.288 --> 31:03.934
- Good to see you, man.
- Any activity today?

31:04.034 --> 31:06.115
Yeah, you know, Alberto,
he came up to get some alfalfa.

31:06.215 --> 31:08.881
You'll probably see him, but other than
that, nothing. Nothing other than that.

31:08.981 --> 31:12.414
- Big day protecting the homeland, huh?
- Yeah, yeah. For sure.

31:12.514 --> 31:15.447
Say, y'all wanna join us for lunch?

31:15.547 --> 31:18.427
- We got enough, right?
- What kinda question is that?

31:18.527 --> 31:21.205
Boy, you know I've got a surplus of sausage.

31:21.847 --> 31:23.911
Not if Hobbs joins in.

31:24.011 --> 31:27.282
Say, where is the old bastard anyway?

31:28.147 --> 31:32.015
He was complaining all day yesterday
about having to work with you today, Davis.

31:32.115 --> 31:36.015
Yeah, he... well, he said...
what did he say about his leg? Something...

31:36.115 --> 31:40.314
I don't know. He's at a doctor's appointment,
I don't know where the fuck...

31:40.414 --> 31:42.447
It's Hobbs, you know.

31:42.547 --> 31:44.281
- Flores.
- Hendricks.

31:44.381 --> 31:45.948
Good to see you, bub. Davis.

31:46.048 --> 31:48.671
- How are you doing?
- Yes, sir.

31:49.580 --> 31:52.839
- So where's old Hobbs at?
- Doctor's appointment.

31:53.780 --> 31:56.488
- Huh?
- Yeah.

31:58.530 --> 32:01.855
Yeah, I bet that doctor
prescribed a treadmill.

32:03.948 --> 32:06.948
Yeah. Yeah.

32:07.048 --> 32:10.514
I bet you he still finds a way to sneak in
an enchilada while he's on it.

32:10.614 --> 32:13.598
Yeah, complaining about
his knees the whole damn time.

32:13.747 --> 32:16.248
Anyway, are you guys
gonna stay and eat or what?

32:16.348 --> 32:18.948
No, we've got to cut it.
We got to head up to Millers Creek.

32:19.048 --> 32:21.414
You guys were 10 minutes late,
so we've got to get out of here.

32:21.514 --> 32:23.947
- Doubling back today, boys.
- Mmm-hmm.

32:24.047 --> 32:28.080
You boys see Hobbs,
you tell him I want a doctor's note, too.

32:28.180 --> 32:31.548
- Yeah? For what?
- Last time we were working a checkpoint...

32:31.648 --> 32:35.114
...Hobbs has to leave early
to go to the dentist, right?

32:35.214 --> 32:38.681
So right after he takes off,
truck pulls up...

32:38.781 --> 32:42.548
...packed with a bunch
of gosh dang Guatemalans.

32:42.648 --> 32:46.381
God forbid you have to fill out
a report and not him.

32:46.481 --> 32:48.948
But, unfortunately, a doctor
can't teach you how to spell.

32:49.048 --> 32:51.514
Yeah, that's funny, Valdez,
'cause that's not even what I was saying.

32:51.614 --> 32:54.915
You've always got to take it to the spelling,
don't you? It's always where it's got to go.

32:55.015 --> 32:57.815
- Well, boys...
- When I ask, I care. Flores.

32:57.915 --> 33:00.214
- We're gonna head out.
- All right. Davis.

33:00.314 --> 33:02.414
- Don't be late again.
- Yes, sir.

33:02.514 --> 33:04.382
Can you spell, sir?

33:04.681 --> 33:07.114
Hey, enjoy paradise.

33:07.214 --> 33:10.071
- Have a great day, sugar.
- Yeah, you, too.

33:33.146 --> 33:35.404
700 to Charlie 36.

33:36.513 --> 33:38.971
<i>Charlie 36, go ahead.</i>

33:39.980 --> 33:41.980
Yeah, we've been relieved of checkpoint 21-A.

33:42.080 --> 33:45.251
We're heading south to cut
for side at Millers Creek.

33:46.213 --> 33:49.284
<i>Understood. I'll leave the scanner for it.</i>

33:50.613 --> 33:52.138
Affirmative.

33:55.613 --> 33:59.271
How long do you think you can
keep that up? We're headed west.

34:00.014 --> 34:03.947
I'll have to check in a couple of times.
There's nobody in this zone so we'll be fine.

34:04.047 --> 34:08.504
And Hobbs? He's gonna have
a hard time reporting his position.

34:10.780 --> 34:13.208
No, he'll only be there for a minute.

34:13.748 --> 34:17.036
So it'll be... we'll figure it out.
It'll be okay.

34:23.612 --> 34:25.647
How many times has it been?

34:25.746 --> 34:27.170
What?

34:27.784 --> 34:30.038
How long have you been doing this?

34:33.980 --> 34:35.804
It's not the first time.

34:38.647 --> 34:41.672
The first time was eight months ago.

34:43.746 --> 34:45.880
And that was supposed to be it.
We were done after that.

34:45.981 --> 34:49.900
The second time,
they sent me a picture of my sister.

34:51.813 --> 34:53.616
So it happened again...

34:54.164 --> 34:57.771
...and now it's happened
three times in the last month.

35:00.513 --> 35:02.648
Look, I didn't ask for this, Flores.

35:02.748 --> 35:05.980
The offer doesn't come unless you're asking
for it. How much are they paying you?

35:06.080 --> 35:09.171
Don't you fucking get righteous on me, man.

35:09.513 --> 35:12.548
I go to the fucking laundromat,
they're watching me.

35:12.648 --> 35:15.571
I pull up at a stop sign,
they're fucking watching me.

35:18.647 --> 35:21.448
I wake up in the middle of the night,
I'm tied to a bed...

35:21.548 --> 35:25.437
...man standing over me
with a knife to my fucking nuts.

35:26.113 --> 35:29.413
I wave the car through. The next day
I wake up, there's a bag of 15 grand...

35:29.513 --> 35:32.066
...at my back door. I take it. I bury it.

35:32.166 --> 35:35.414
- I don't want the fucking money!
- You should've come to us.

35:35.514 --> 35:37.748
You should've come to me.
I would've protected you.

35:37.848 --> 35:41.481
What are you gonna do? You're good
at your job. You're gonna report it.

35:41.581 --> 35:43.781
They're gonna send me up north,
just like Wilkes.

35:43.881 --> 35:46.276
And we know what happened to Wilkes.
He went north to New York...

35:46.376 --> 35:50.037
...and three months later,
he dies in a freak hiking accident.

35:50.396 --> 35:52.821
And now it's too late for all that shit.

35:53.914 --> 35:57.414
Now, we've just got to keep driving.
It's our only option.

35:57.514 --> 36:01.037
We should be there by now.
Where the fuck is this place?

36:01.647 --> 36:03.649
Should be coming up on it.

36:04.227 --> 36:06.838
Wait, no, this is it. This is it.

36:07.447 --> 36:10.905
Stop. Slow down. Slow down.
Slow down. Stop. Stop.

36:14.880 --> 36:16.683
I don't see shit.

36:17.581 --> 36:20.280
If you're fucking driving me in circles,
I swear to God, Flores.

36:20.380 --> 36:24.284
Look, I don't know the meanings
to your cartel messages, all right?

36:24.880 --> 36:28.338
- I'm just telling you what I know.
- Well, get out, and start looking for it.

36:38.346 --> 36:41.349
Maybe it's... maybe it's an address.

36:41.748 --> 36:43.805
An address with no street name?

36:44.814 --> 36:48.304
They were coordinates. We're standing on it.

36:53.946 --> 36:55.838
Smell that?

37:11.146 --> 37:12.953
Here we go.

37:26.814 --> 37:29.381
"Black Trumpet Canyon."
What the fuck is that?

37:29.481 --> 37:31.683
It's the Aguas Frias canyons.

37:32.181 --> 37:35.013
They were called "Black Trumpet"
a long time ago.

37:35.113 --> 37:37.347
Is there a post office in Aguas Frias?

37:37.447 --> 37:39.870
There's no anything in Aguas Frias.

37:42.614 --> 37:45.838
If you wanna make your drop in time,
we better go look around.

38:15.380 --> 38:19.271
There's still a couple of corners
of this canyon we haven't checked yet.

38:59.279 --> 39:02.304
This is it. This is it.

39:04.180 --> 39:06.438
How long do you think this has been here?

39:07.013 --> 39:10.481
Couple months? Couple decades?
Who gives a shit?

39:10.581 --> 39:12.186
So...

39:12.955 --> 39:15.275
...we need to move the truck...

39:15.375 --> 39:19.071
...'cause this will never work
if that truck's there, and...

39:19.680 --> 39:21.171
...yeah.

39:25.080 --> 39:30.116
Flores, thanks for helping me, man.
You didn't have to do that. Thank you.

39:31.179 --> 39:32.987
Get the stuff out.

39:44.812 --> 39:46.981
Hey, Hobbs, I got you some...

39:51.046 --> 39:54.137
I trusted you. You were always weak.

40:03.313 --> 40:05.481
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

40:05.581 --> 40:08.671
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

40:10.946 --> 40:14.371
Oh, shit. Davis.

40:21.580 --> 40:24.348
There they are. There they are.
Okay. Here they come. Come on.

40:24.448 --> 40:25.555
Fuck the drugs, man!

40:25.655 --> 40:29.538
No! Get him in here! Get him in here!
We've got to go! Get him in here now!

40:30.413 --> 40:32.410
No, no, no!

40:32.510 --> 40:34.980
Fuck! No, no, no!

40:35.080 --> 40:37.446
No! Come back! Come back!

40:37.546 --> 40:40.837
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

40:47.846 --> 40:51.270
- He shot me, Flores.
- Try not to talk, man.

40:52.386 --> 40:53.561
Oh, shit.

40:53.661 --> 40:55.075
- Okay.
- Is he okay?

40:55.175 --> 40:56.647
The fuck do you think? His gut's shot.

40:56.747 --> 40:59.100
Maybe he shouldn't... He was
choking me. I was just trying...

40:59.200 --> 41:02.121
That doesn't matter, man.
You've gotta call in life right now.

41:02.221 --> 41:04.914
- There's gotta be another way we can help him.
- Davis, come on, man!

41:05.014 --> 41:07.180
- Just get him in the fucking truck.
- Davis, look...

41:07.280 --> 41:09.913
I'll take him anywhere. I'm not taking him
to a fucking hospital. Come on.

41:10.013 --> 41:13.014
- Fuck!
- Help me get him in here! Let's go!

41:30.645 --> 41:32.171
Jiminez!

41:34.046 --> 41:35.571
Jiminez!

41:41.519 --> 41:43.337
What's going on?

41:43.812 --> 41:45.647
We need help.

41:46.046 --> 41:50.264
- Is she here?
- Camilo, go get Marisa. Hurry!

41:56.113 --> 41:58.581
Flores, where are we?

42:00.646 --> 42:02.847
He hasn't lost too much blood.
Unless you've cleaned him.

42:02.947 --> 42:05.413
No. That's it.

42:05.513 --> 42:09.264
- Then it doesn't seem that bad.
- Who is this, Flores?

42:09.662 --> 42:11.521
It's okay.

42:13.712 --> 42:15.174
Marisa.

42:28.712 --> 42:32.279
- What's she's saying?
- It's K'iche'. She's Mayan.

42:32.379 --> 42:36.279
- What did she say?
- She wants to take him somewhere cleaner.

42:36.379 --> 42:39.004
- Is it far?
- Not very.

42:39.712 --> 42:42.603
Okay. Come on.

42:44.779 --> 42:46.613
Where are we?

42:46.713 --> 42:50.546
It's all right. We can't get to the
hospital yet. We're gonna buy some time.

42:50.646 --> 42:52.080
Where the hell are we?

42:52.180 --> 42:54.181
- It's all right, man.
- Let me go.

42:56.617 --> 42:58.447
Let me go.

42:58.547 --> 43:01.838
Just let me go. I'll be all right. Let me go.

43:23.980 --> 43:26.581
- Hobbs, she's got to see the wound, okay?
- Not a goddamn chance.

43:26.681 --> 43:28.503
You've got to let her help.

43:28.946 --> 43:31.839
Just make it... make it fast.

43:32.238 --> 43:36.855
- We need to move him. Hold him.
- Careful. Careful. His arm is broken.

43:44.646 --> 43:46.504
In his mouth.

43:49.446 --> 43:51.338
Hold him.

43:57.580 --> 44:00.404
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

44:01.946 --> 44:04.004
It's okay. You'll be all right.

44:24.078 --> 44:27.941
What's she saying? What do we need to do?

44:29.713 --> 44:33.799
A prayer. That he has
safe passage to the other side.

44:37.745 --> 44:39.570
What do you mean?

44:41.046 --> 44:42.871
She can't do anything more.

44:49.879 --> 44:52.547
Fuck that. Ask her.

44:52.647 --> 44:56.371
- If she said she can't do more...
- Ask her what we need to do!

45:04.612 --> 45:09.780
She says, his organs, they're ruined.

45:09.880 --> 45:11.904
There's nothing else she can do.

45:12.446 --> 45:16.214
She can make him comfortable, but that's it.

45:16.314 --> 45:19.460
Okay, let's make him comfortable.
A doctor's gonna do more.

45:19.560 --> 45:23.027
Let's go, Davis. If we can't get him to
a hospital, we gotta get him to a chopper...

45:23.127 --> 45:29.047
- ...but he's got to go somewhere now.
- No, Flores, you heard the woman, okay?

45:29.147 --> 45:33.580
- He's not gonna make it.
- Davis, come on, man. It's over.

45:33.680 --> 45:35.780
Let her make him comfortable.
We'll get him in the truck...

45:35.880 --> 45:38.646
...and we'll go finish
what we already started, okay?

45:38.746 --> 45:42.558
Fuck you. Give me the keys. Give me
the keys. I'm gonna take him myself.

45:42.757 --> 45:45.813
- Give me the keys!
- I'm not fucking giving you the keys.

45:45.913 --> 45:49.737
He needs real medicine.
He needs a doctor. We've gotta try.

45:50.612 --> 45:53.347
I know that, and...

45:53.447 --> 45:55.513
...she said it's too late for him...

45:55.613 --> 45:59.347
...but it's not too late for me,
and you know that, okay?

45:59.447 --> 46:03.070
Flores, sit your fucking ass down right now.

46:05.578 --> 46:07.512
Tell her to finish.

46:07.612 --> 46:09.382
Come on.

46:10.546 --> 46:12.403
Come on!

46:29.213 --> 46:31.303
It's gonna be all right, man.

46:36.346 --> 46:40.637
In the truck. Come on.
Hey, in the truck right now.

46:42.146 --> 46:43.980
In here.

46:53.013 --> 46:54.904
Yeah, in the truck.

47:18.279 --> 47:20.537
<i>Charlie 36, 700.</i>

47:24.712 --> 47:27.804
<i>Charlie 36, 700. Do you copy?</i>

47:31.512 --> 47:33.179
Go for 700.

47:33.279 --> 47:36.770
<i>Yeah, we've got no confirmation
Hobbs reported to his next shift.</i>

47:37.746 --> 47:41.946
<i>We're sending agents to initiate a search.
Standby as needed.</i>

47:42.046 --> 47:43.537
Fuck!

47:51.146 --> 47:53.037
What the fuck are you doing?

47:53.679 --> 47:57.370
Hey! Hey! What the fuck are you doing?

47:58.586 --> 48:02.113
Put that shit back in there.
Put that shit back in there.

48:02.213 --> 48:04.704
- Flores, don't try me.
- Do it.

48:05.412 --> 48:07.747
- Do it.
- Don't try...

48:07.847 --> 48:10.779
You're a big man. You shoot agents. Do it!

48:10.879 --> 48:14.174
- Flores, don't.
- Do it!

48:16.079 --> 48:17.904
Do it.

48:21.113 --> 48:22.570
Okay.

49:01.345 --> 49:05.046
I got him, Hobbs. It's gonna be okay,
all right? We're gonna call the chopper.

49:05.146 --> 49:06.880
No.

49:06.980 --> 49:09.603
- 700, Charlie 14.
- Don't call them.

49:12.612 --> 49:14.870
700, Charlie 14.

49:15.912 --> 49:18.370
I'm done fighting, Flores.

49:20.345 --> 49:23.647
- Don't call the chopper.
- No, no, no. Don't say that.

49:23.747 --> 49:27.637
- Please don't call the chopper.
- Stay with me, okay? We've got to try.

49:30.479 --> 49:33.937
I ain't dying up in that... in that machine.

49:34.612 --> 49:36.670
I need to hear the wind.

49:39.979 --> 49:42.269
<i>Charlie 14, go ahead.</i>

49:43.746 --> 49:45.420
No chopper.

49:48.178 --> 49:50.070
I'm done fighting.

49:57.746 --> 50:01.804
Come on. Get me out of this cage, Flores.

50:08.745 --> 50:10.570
We can do that.

50:16.128 --> 50:18.220
10-3, still on the trail.

50:34.462 --> 50:35.937
Davis.

50:38.362 --> 50:40.804
Davis? Davis?

50:52.445 --> 50:54.470
I need your help.

50:57.979 --> 51:00.837
I need your help to get him out of the truck.

51:37.278 --> 51:39.137
Look at that.

51:44.612 --> 51:50.504
Apaches, Comanches,
they fought over this land, too.

51:52.345 --> 51:54.370
The same land.

51:56.212 --> 51:58.853
But we put these borders here.

52:04.579 --> 52:06.404
Flores, tell them...

52:08.278 --> 52:10.504
...tell my kids to...

52:11.846 --> 52:15.712
Just make sure they don't...

52:17.612 --> 52:19.633
...forget to listen.

52:22.445 --> 52:24.270
Yes, sir.

52:27.812 --> 52:29.704
Yes, sir, I will.

53:18.128 --> 53:22.746
I'm so sorry, Flores.
I never meant for any of this to happen.

53:24.879 --> 53:27.704
You should just call it in. It's over, man.

53:30.512 --> 53:33.647
- Who calls you, huh?
- What?

53:33.747 --> 53:36.270
Who calls you about the fucking drops?

53:36.412 --> 53:38.913
- I don't know anything, man.
- Davis, if you fucking lie to me...

53:39.013 --> 53:42.903
- ...I'll smash your fucking face off.
- I don't know anything. They just call me.

53:43.646 --> 53:47.070
And send me pictures of my family.
I don't know anything.

53:47.812 --> 53:50.437
- You never met anyone?
- No.

53:51.145 --> 53:53.346
What about the car in the canyon?
You seen that one?

53:53.446 --> 53:56.137
No. I don't know anything.

54:02.312 --> 54:05.770
You're gonna go to jail for
a very long time. You know that?

54:08.978 --> 54:11.178
But first, we're going to see your boss.

55:16.679 --> 55:18.537
Hey, Flores?

55:22.379 --> 55:24.404
I could still warn them.

55:36.412 --> 55:38.470
This is our blood.

55:41.646 --> 55:43.670
This was your family.

55:55.212 --> 55:57.703
<i>Charlie 14, 700.</i>

56:05.445 --> 56:07.503
Go, 700.

56:08.412 --> 56:12.979
<i>Agents found a vehicle near the 218
checkpoint, but 10-7, no trafficker.</i>

56:13.079 --> 56:17.136
<i>No sign of Hobbs. Return to the station now.</i>

56:21.512 --> 56:23.753
<i>Charlie 14, do you copy...</i>

56:32.312 --> 56:34.358
All right, we were here.

56:34.940 --> 56:37.230
The car pulled up over there.

56:38.028 --> 56:40.887
Get in the truck.
Point the lights in that direction.

57:08.629 --> 57:10.487
This is good.

58:05.412 --> 58:07.236
What is that?

58:20.178 --> 58:22.003
Kill the lights.

58:27.678 --> 58:29.350
Give me your mags.

58:47.578 --> 58:49.470
Follow my lead.

59:39.011 --> 59:40.512
- Put your hands up!
- Hey!

59:40.612 --> 59:44.007
- Put your hands up right now! Don't move!
- I got them up, man. Take it easy.

59:44.107 --> 59:46.579
- Just take it easy, all right?
- Who else is here?

59:46.679 --> 59:50.503
- Nobody, just... just me.
- It's all clear.

59:52.778 --> 59:54.847
Is that your car outside?

59:55.246 --> 59:57.612
I don't know.
I have to see it to know which one...

59:57.712 --> 01:00:00.910
The fucking piece of shit out front,
is that your car?

01:00:01.578 --> 01:00:03.080
Maybe.

01:00:03.479 --> 01:00:05.737
Come on, smart ass. Walk! Walk!

01:00:07.478 --> 01:00:10.080
Stand right there. Don't move.

01:00:10.628 --> 01:00:12.257
Turn around.

01:00:13.611 --> 01:00:15.380
All right, all right.

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:18.919
- I don't got anything.
- Just sit your ass down. Sit down.

01:00:19.878 --> 01:00:21.361
Look...

01:00:22.458 --> 01:00:24.158
...how can I help you guys?

01:00:25.446 --> 01:00:28.113
Tell us about the drug shipment
you were picking up.

01:00:28.213 --> 01:00:30.015
Oh!

01:00:30.713 --> 01:00:33.347
So you boys are in a little trouble, right?

01:00:33.447 --> 01:00:36.946
Because if not, you wouldn't have
broken in here without a warrant...

01:00:37.046 --> 01:00:39.870
...and harassed an old man like me, right?

01:00:40.511 --> 01:00:45.170
And I didn't hear anything on the radio
about two <i>pericos</i> being in this zone...

01:00:45.978 --> 01:00:50.037
...which means nobody knows that you're here.

01:00:53.312 --> 01:00:56.446
- Listen, pardon my manners, man...
- Sit down. Did I say get up?

01:00:56.546 --> 01:01:01.511
- I didn't tell you to get up. Sit down.
- Whoa! Okay, okay. Okay, man.

01:01:01.611 --> 01:01:05.103
My name is Miguel Hernandez, and...

01:01:05.645 --> 01:01:09.285
You don't have a label,
and you've got blood on your hands.

01:01:13.145 --> 01:01:17.235
And... you're Davis, huh?

01:01:18.712 --> 01:01:21.180
I like it that your name
is right by your face...

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:24.482
...because it's gonna make it
very easy for me to identify you...

01:01:24.582 --> 01:01:28.047
...out of a lineup
when I sue your fucking asses.

01:01:28.645 --> 01:01:30.237
Shit.

01:01:31.012 --> 01:01:32.866
Now, which one of you fucked up?

01:01:36.878 --> 01:01:39.880
It's you, ain't it, huh? Yeah.

01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:42.713
I can smell snitches and bitches
from a mile away.

01:01:42.813 --> 01:01:46.579
Shut the fuck up.
Who are you picking up the drugs for?

01:01:46.679 --> 01:01:49.446
- Who are you hoping to deliver them to?
- You better fucking tell us.

01:01:49.546 --> 01:01:52.246
Listen, cut out the macho bullshit.

01:01:52.346 --> 01:01:54.499
You don't even have a clip in that gun, huh?

01:01:54.599 --> 01:01:57.511
And I bet there's not
a bullet in the chamber.

01:01:57.611 --> 01:02:00.114
You wanna talk to me?
We talk like professionals.

01:02:00.313 --> 01:02:03.913
And you're not stupid
because you found this fucking place.

01:02:04.013 --> 01:02:07.828
Shit. I have problems finding this place.

01:02:07.928 --> 01:02:09.981
Yeah, I found you.

01:02:10.379 --> 01:02:14.278
I'm here to question a cartel
errand boy about who his daddy is.

01:02:14.378 --> 01:02:16.203
"Errand boy."

01:02:17.611 --> 01:02:20.746
Why do you hurt me like that?
That's insulting.

01:02:20.846 --> 01:02:24.546
You boys are tough and brave
and all that, but you're misinformed.

01:02:24.646 --> 01:02:30.137
You thought that you were gonna find
the hiding place of a cartel goon?

01:02:31.712 --> 01:02:37.569
But what you did was follow a senior
citizen to his place of employment.

01:02:38.045 --> 01:02:41.482
Yeah. With, I'm guessing...

01:02:41.582 --> 01:02:44.046
...a truckload of drugs. Huh?

01:02:44.146 --> 01:02:46.036
That's enough bullshit.

01:02:47.411 --> 01:02:49.447
I know you're working for the cartel.

01:02:49.846 --> 01:02:53.596
I could turn this whole place out
and prove it, but I'm not here to arrest you.

01:02:53.696 --> 01:02:58.103
You understand? And, yeah, you're right.
Nobody knows we're out here.

01:02:58.978 --> 01:03:00.569
No one.

01:03:11.212 --> 01:03:13.069
Shut up.

01:03:14.478 --> 01:03:17.936
Shut up. Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

01:03:18.878 --> 01:03:20.846
You don't know me!

01:03:20.946 --> 01:03:25.003
And you say one more thing about my family,
I'll fucking kill you! Shut the fuck up.

01:03:26.445 --> 01:03:29.746
- Tell me who you're working for.
- Put the gun down.

01:03:29.846 --> 01:03:31.903
You talk, and it goes away.

01:03:33.277 --> 01:03:34.736
Tio.

01:03:43.145 --> 01:03:45.279
I don't know what cartel he works for...

01:03:45.379 --> 01:03:49.003
...but he's the one who controls
all the traffic around this zone.

01:03:51.578 --> 01:03:53.713
You wanna get in contact with Tio?

01:03:53.813 --> 01:03:56.702
Listen, you still got the stuff, right?

01:03:57.327 --> 01:03:59.356
- Most of it.
- Good.

01:03:59.456 --> 01:04:03.255
You keep it in the trunk of your car,
and then you drive to the river...

01:04:03.355 --> 01:04:05.402
...and you dump it right there.

01:04:06.344 --> 01:04:08.769
You splash it down, man.

01:04:10.178 --> 01:04:12.829
- Drive it to the river.
- Yeah.

01:04:15.878 --> 01:04:18.218
He's fucking with us. Just shoot him.

01:04:18.318 --> 01:04:22.879
Listen, the driver, in case... in case they
get corralled by cowboys like you guys...

01:04:22.979 --> 01:04:26.779
...they're supposed to make a run for it.
If they can't make a clean getaway...

01:04:26.879 --> 01:04:30.535
...then they're supposed to go
to the river and dump the shit.

01:04:31.045 --> 01:04:35.412
Tio, he's got a lot of boys working
for him in the river with ferries.

01:04:35.512 --> 01:04:38.179
They pick up the merchandise,
they transfer it to another car...

01:04:38.279 --> 01:04:41.170
...and they send another driver.
It's not hard.

01:04:45.711 --> 01:04:47.646
- Ferries?
- Yeah.

01:04:47.746 --> 01:04:51.952
We've been up and down that river 100 times,
never seen a ferry. He's bullshitting us.

01:04:52.052 --> 01:04:55.173
- Fucking bullshitting us.
- Jesus, you fucking...

01:04:55.273 --> 01:05:00.312
Bambi, you're so stupid. You think you're
the only snitch that's under Tio, huh?

01:05:00.412 --> 01:05:02.469
You think you're the only one?

01:05:06.978 --> 01:05:08.803
All right, look.

01:05:10.478 --> 01:05:12.336
I need to talk to him.

01:05:14.078 --> 01:05:16.137
And that's a long river, Miguel.

01:05:18.112 --> 01:05:21.488
If I wanna find him, where would I start?

01:05:24.145 --> 01:05:25.603
Um...

01:05:27.745 --> 01:05:32.396
What road were you guys on
when you made the stop...

01:05:32.496 --> 01:05:34.544
...got the drugs and shit?

01:05:34.644 --> 01:05:36.616
218.

01:05:38.344 --> 01:05:40.745
I'd start there. You know...

01:05:41.751 --> 01:05:43.829
...that's what I would do.

01:05:48.912 --> 01:05:51.769
Wanna know the truth? Huh?

01:05:52.045 --> 01:05:55.469
I wish to God you don't find him, all right?

01:05:55.745 --> 01:05:58.169
Because from one errand boy to another...

01:05:59.378 --> 01:06:05.037
...man, I've seen horrible people
do horrible things.

01:06:05.745 --> 01:06:07.141
Damn!

01:06:07.241 --> 01:06:08.784
But Tio...

01:06:09.179 --> 01:06:14.003
...he makes all those criminals
look like Bambi's fucking mother.

01:06:15.745 --> 01:06:20.003
If you find that ferry,
and Tio sees your face...

01:06:21.194 --> 01:06:24.486
...make sure he doesn't come out alive.

01:06:27.144 --> 01:06:29.196
For all of our sakes.

01:06:36.378 --> 01:06:38.202
I will.

01:06:57.012 --> 01:06:58.862
I guess we...

01:06:59.621 --> 01:07:01.513
...take the car...

01:07:02.444 --> 01:07:05.669
...drive it off the cliff,
do the splash down, and then we...

01:07:07.795 --> 01:07:10.286
...face off against the cartel.

01:07:21.411 --> 01:07:23.470
I thought I could protect you.

01:07:26.578 --> 01:07:28.636
I know now that you were right.

01:07:29.678 --> 01:07:31.502
I can't.

01:07:34.845 --> 01:07:36.918
It's 'cause I'm weak.

01:07:37.561 --> 01:07:39.571
He saw weakness in me.

01:07:40.778 --> 01:07:43.035
- No.
- Yeah.

01:07:46.778 --> 01:07:49.003
It could've been any one of us.

01:07:52.878 --> 01:07:55.169
We all have a fear to survive.

01:07:57.411 --> 01:07:59.303
Whatever it takes.

01:08:07.598 --> 01:08:09.602
That lady cursed me.

01:08:11.244 --> 01:08:14.611
- No.
- That Mayan lady...

01:08:14.711 --> 01:08:19.602
...I could tell by the way she was saying
whatever she was saying, she...

01:08:20.694 --> 01:08:22.736
...she cursed me.

01:08:27.645 --> 01:08:30.502
Boy, you were cursed a long time before this.

01:08:32.810 --> 01:08:34.265
Stop!

01:08:49.479 --> 01:08:51.569
What are you doing here?

01:08:52.511 --> 01:08:54.877
Hey, hey, it's okay.
Just put your hands down.

01:08:54.978 --> 01:08:56.944
Hey, Davis, get him some water.

01:08:57.045 --> 01:09:00.336
- Flores, we don't have time for this...
- Water, just get it for him.

01:09:02.810 --> 01:09:04.636
Where did you cross?

01:09:06.247 --> 01:09:07.670
Huh?

01:09:08.278 --> 01:09:09.952
Did someone bring you over?

01:09:13.810 --> 01:09:17.057
Have you seen a ferry? Huh?

01:09:17.555 --> 01:09:20.214
Look at me. Huh?

01:09:20.813 --> 01:09:22.747
- Look at me.
- Flores, get down!

01:09:43.243 --> 01:09:45.479
Alright. Let's get the drugs.

01:09:45.578 --> 01:09:47.603
Tio wants the big radio too.

01:10:03.127 --> 01:10:05.169
He'll be dead soon.

01:10:42.528 --> 01:10:44.036
Davis.

01:10:46.077 --> 01:10:47.969
Davis, they're gone.

01:14:33.077 --> 01:14:36.269
Calm down, <i>perico.</i> You're injured.

01:14:49.295 --> 01:14:51.169
He has a fever.

01:14:52.578 --> 01:14:54.668
He's lost a lot of blood.

01:14:55.544 --> 01:14:59.436
Just build a fire.
La Migra will see it from their planes.

01:15:00.744 --> 01:15:02.602
They won't find him in time.

01:15:05.593 --> 01:15:08.049
You don't know what he got into.

01:15:17.212 --> 01:15:20.902
You all keep going.
You know the route by now.

01:15:23.144 --> 01:15:24.635
Huh.

01:15:28.044 --> 01:15:30.102
I can't leave him to die here.

01:15:31.977 --> 01:15:33.847
You all keep going.

01:15:34.446 --> 01:15:38.811
Keep that ridge on your left
and you'll find the road.

01:15:38.911 --> 01:15:41.002
Martin will be there.

01:15:54.210 --> 01:15:56.068
Help me.

01:16:52.311 --> 01:16:54.169
Are you ready to continue?

01:16:56.743 --> 01:16:58.236
Yes.

01:16:59.445 --> 01:17:03.076
So the radio reports you made along
the way, those were falsified.

01:17:03.176 --> 01:17:05.002
Is that correct?

01:17:05.543 --> 01:17:06.968
Yes.

01:17:10.744 --> 01:17:12.613
And the mailbox?

01:17:13.012 --> 01:17:15.613
Evidence couldn't find it in Aguas Frias.

01:17:15.912 --> 01:17:17.969
You sure that's where you saw it?

01:17:20.211 --> 01:17:22.682
We need verbal acknowledgment, Flores.

01:17:26.227 --> 01:17:28.319
Yes, that's correct.

01:17:35.844 --> 01:17:38.149
I think that covers
everything I need to know.

01:17:38.944 --> 01:17:41.745
Again, the agency can, in no way...

01:17:41.845 --> 01:17:45.478
...be held responsible for the actions
of a lone, deranged individual.

01:17:45.578 --> 01:17:51.268
But, uh, we do apologize for any pain that
you've endured, having to go through it.

01:17:52.213 --> 01:17:53.661
Well...

01:17:54.721 --> 01:17:57.546
...that's quite a story, Flores.

01:17:58.911 --> 01:18:03.761
Think it's one we'll ask you
to keep to yourself, hmm?

01:18:07.178 --> 01:18:11.132
Now, Agent Jansen is standing by to...

01:18:11.232 --> 01:18:13.212
...discuss your options.

01:18:13.312 --> 01:18:16.845
There's an opening down in McAllen
or others on the northern border...

01:18:16.945 --> 01:18:19.835
...if you need to get out of the heat.

01:18:23.477 --> 01:18:27.101
We caught two boys the morning
that we brought you in.

01:18:27.710 --> 01:18:32.511
And one of them had a gunshot wound, and
the other one was carrying a small backpack.

01:18:32.611 --> 01:18:35.411
They had $3,000 worth of coke on them.

01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:37.935
Is that right?

01:19:05.111 --> 01:19:08.344
Okay, so what'd you say he did again? He...

01:19:08.444 --> 01:19:10.247
Brushed out.

01:19:10.645 --> 01:19:14.745
Right, and that's where they
move in and out of a brush?

01:19:14.845 --> 01:19:16.868
No, no, no.

01:19:17.477 --> 01:19:19.280
He's covering his tracks.

01:19:19.878 --> 01:19:22.899
He just takes a branch and brushes it out.

01:19:27.610 --> 01:19:31.146
- Watch that hole.
- Thanks.

01:19:31.246 --> 01:19:34.512
So how are we gonna find
the prints again if he's brushing out?

01:19:37.678 --> 01:19:39.223
Well...

01:19:39.806 --> 01:19:42.011
...that storm's pretty hot on us.

01:19:43.127 --> 01:19:45.744
We might lose the prints there, but...

01:19:45.844 --> 01:19:48.102
...otherwise we'll find him.

01:19:49.811 --> 01:19:53.236
You know, I was thinking,
maybe after we're done here... ow.

01:19:54.911 --> 01:19:59.112
Jaeger, look, if you're gonna keep running
your mouth, not paying attention...

01:19:59.212 --> 01:20:02.179
