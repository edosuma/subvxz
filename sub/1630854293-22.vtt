00:02.530 --> 00:03.620
<i>Previously on</i> S.W.A.T...

00:03.820 --> 00:04.920
How's your kid?
Do you even have a kid?

00:05.120 --> 00:06.590
I had the baby. Thomas.
That's his name.

00:06.790 --> 00:09.020
My parents found a couple
who wanted to adopt him.

00:09.220 --> 00:10.190
So, I signed the papers.

00:10.390 --> 00:11.590
I've never forgiven myself.

00:11.790 --> 00:13.690
Meet DEA agent Mack Boyle,

00:13.890 --> 00:16.500
the leader of the DEA
Narcotics Task Force.

00:16.700 --> 00:18.700
This is his special
response tac squad.

00:18.900 --> 00:20.500
<i>STREET: Shorty,</i>
<i>Marcos Guzman's little brother.</i>

00:20.700 --> 00:23.140
Don't shoot.
Marcos?
What are you doing here?

00:23.340 --> 00:24.600
Offer from the DEA...

00:24.800 --> 00:26.440
They drop your
resisting arrest charge

00:26.640 --> 00:28.310
when Ulan is captured.

00:28.510 --> 00:30.140
You enter WITSEC with
a healthy stipend to boot.

00:30.340 --> 00:31.380
Shorty too, right?

00:31.580 --> 00:33.150
DEACON: Sancho Zamora.
Cocaine kingpin.

00:33.350 --> 00:35.780
I hear Sancho hasn't left
Mexico since the late '90s.

00:35.980 --> 00:37.320
(gunfire)

00:37.520 --> 00:39.290
Ulan Zamora is down.

00:39.490 --> 00:41.620
<i>MURIEL: Until the cartel</i>
<i>gets their $3 million back,</i>

00:41.820 --> 00:43.290
<i>all of our families</i>
<i>are in danger.</i>

00:43.490 --> 00:44.520
I regret to inform you

00:44.720 --> 00:45.590
that your brother Shorty
has been killed.

00:45.790 --> 00:47.260
You said my brother'd be safe!

00:47.460 --> 00:49.550
You killed him!

00:51.010 --> 00:54.030
PASTOR: And so with love,
we shall leave you in peace.

00:54.230 --> 00:56.940
Go now with God, to love
and serve the Lord.

00:57.140 --> 00:58.950
(quiet chatter)

01:10.870 --> 01:12.740
Marcos, look.

01:21.640 --> 01:22.930
You got no right coming here.

01:23.130 --> 01:25.330
Hey, we just wanted
to pay our respects.

01:25.530 --> 01:26.670
If you had any respect,

01:26.870 --> 01:27.900
you'd leave my family
the hell alone.

01:28.100 --> 01:29.500
LUCA: We're sorry
for your loss.

01:29.700 --> 01:31.200
Okay? What happened
to Shorty... it's tragic.

01:31.400 --> 01:32.610
Your damn fault is what it is.

01:32.810 --> 01:34.370
Hey, Marcos, there's no way
we could've known

01:34.570 --> 01:35.770
that Shorty would cross paths

01:35.970 --> 01:37.480
with a rival banger
while he was inside.

01:37.680 --> 01:38.740
Just 'cause you didn't mean
for it to happen

01:38.940 --> 01:40.530
don't change the fact
that it did.

01:41.260 --> 01:42.930
You said Shorty'd be safe.

01:45.170 --> 01:46.650
See how much your promises mean?

01:46.850 --> 01:48.900
Look, our promise is still good.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.220
We failed at
saving Shorty, but...

01:51.420 --> 01:52.560
you and Muriel
can still get out.

01:52.760 --> 01:53.890
The hell you mean?

01:54.090 --> 01:55.490
The WITSEC deal
the DEA put on the table,

01:55.690 --> 01:56.500
for your cooperation.

01:56.700 --> 01:57.860
Is this a joke?

01:58.060 --> 01:59.730
No, man. You wanted
to get Shorty and Muriel

01:59.930 --> 02:01.000
out of the life.

02:01.200 --> 02:02.400
Shorty's gone,

02:02.600 --> 02:04.470
Muriel and her baby
still need your help.

02:04.670 --> 02:05.570
The documents are all drawn up.

02:05.770 --> 02:07.410
All they need is your signature.

02:07.610 --> 02:09.640
You and your cousin
can start new lives.

02:09.840 --> 02:11.680
I only took that deal
for Shorty.

02:11.880 --> 02:14.610
We crossed the cartel
'cause we believed in you.

02:14.810 --> 02:15.910
That belief is over.

02:16.110 --> 02:17.550
Marcos, look,
I know you're a good guy,

02:17.750 --> 02:19.620
you're just hurting right now.

02:19.820 --> 02:21.850
Whenever you're ready,
the deal is waiting for you.

02:22.050 --> 02:23.040
(sighs)

02:24.510 --> 02:26.390
We're done.

02:26.590 --> 02:27.660
Get out of here, Luca.

02:27.860 --> 02:29.630
Marcos, man, come on...

02:29.830 --> 02:32.100
Luca, forget it.
We should go.

02:32.300 --> 02:33.850
Come on.

02:42.290 --> 02:44.530
* *

02:49.700 --> 02:51.220
Hola, Carmina.

02:51.420 --> 02:53.590
Hola, Mr. Corby. Thanks for
letting me start early today.

02:53.790 --> 02:55.590
Got to take my dad to
an appointment later.

02:55.790 --> 02:57.360
How's he doing
after the, uh, the surgery?

02:57.560 --> 02:58.690
(grunts)
(screams)

02:58.890 --> 03:00.910
Call 911!
(grunts)

03:03.550 --> 03:06.050
(grunting)

03:14.660 --> 03:16.160
The hell do you want?

03:26.170 --> 03:27.600
You know who I am.

03:29.070 --> 03:30.860
Sancho Zamora.

03:31.060 --> 03:32.390
Didn't think
you'd have the stones

03:32.590 --> 03:34.840
to set foot in the U.S.

03:36.040 --> 03:39.330
You are the reason
that I am here.

03:39.530 --> 03:41.630
Remember that...

03:41.830 --> 03:45.070
when you are begging
for me to kill you.

03:45.270 --> 03:46.860
(screaming)

03:54.530 --> 03:56.180
That's disappointing.

03:56.380 --> 03:57.880
For me.

03:58.080 --> 03:59.490
Not for you.

03:59.690 --> 04:02.840
Now we have to do this
the fast way.

04:04.270 --> 04:06.230
(screaming)

04:06.430 --> 04:08.880
(Carmina sobbing)

04:20.760 --> 04:21.740
Morning, Powell.

04:21.940 --> 04:24.290
Hey, Deac. Wait up.

04:25.530 --> 04:26.810
I got an invitation

04:27.010 --> 04:28.950
to Vivienne's christening
this weekend.

04:29.150 --> 04:30.680
Did Hondo invite
the whole squad?

04:30.880 --> 04:32.180
He's been pretty
excited about it.

04:32.390 --> 04:33.650
Pretty sure he invited
the whole department.

04:33.850 --> 04:35.320
Do you think
he would be offended

04:35.520 --> 04:36.690
if I didn't show up?

04:36.890 --> 04:38.290
Offended? No.

04:38.490 --> 04:39.830
But he wouldn't've invited you
if he didn't want you there.

04:40.030 --> 04:41.730
Why? You got other plans?

04:41.930 --> 04:44.500
I-I don't really feel like
I'm in the right headspace

04:44.700 --> 04:45.860
to be around
a little baby right now.

04:46.060 --> 04:48.670
It's no secret,
but I...

04:48.870 --> 04:51.040
I gave up a baby for adoption
when I was 15.

04:51.240 --> 04:53.170
And I thought I'd
made peace with it,

04:53.370 --> 04:55.840
but he turned 18
a few months ago and I, uh...

04:56.040 --> 04:57.780
You're thinking he might
try to reach out

04:57.980 --> 05:00.050
now that he's got access
to the adoption records.

05:00.250 --> 05:01.510
Yeah, uh...

05:01.710 --> 05:05.220
Been on pins and needles hoping,
but so far... nothing.

05:05.420 --> 05:08.420
I don't want to bring that
baggage to Vivienne's big day.

05:08.620 --> 05:10.520
Well, I'm sure Hondo
will understand.

05:10.720 --> 05:11.720
But, um...

05:11.920 --> 05:13.360
Can I ask
you something?
Yeah.

05:13.560 --> 05:16.400
Have you ever thought about
being the one to reach out,

05:16.600 --> 05:17.600
try to locate your son?

05:17.800 --> 05:19.030
All the time.

05:19.230 --> 05:21.900
I can't stop wondering
what he's doing,

05:22.100 --> 05:24.440
what kind of guy Thomas
grew up to be.

05:24.640 --> 05:26.640
That's what I named him,
anyways.

05:26.840 --> 05:28.410
His parents probably changed it.

05:28.610 --> 05:30.340
Nah. It's a good name.

05:30.540 --> 05:32.130
So what's stopping you?

05:33.360 --> 05:34.780
I don't know.

05:34.980 --> 05:37.850
Just doesn't seem right
to disrupt his entire life.

05:38.050 --> 05:39.150
I figure,
if he wants to find me,

05:39.350 --> 05:40.490
that should be up to him.

05:40.690 --> 05:42.150
That seems fair.

05:42.350 --> 05:45.060
Look, if you do decide
to go to the christening,

05:45.260 --> 05:46.430
I'll be there.

05:46.630 --> 05:47.490
You can hang with me.

05:47.690 --> 05:49.710
I appreciate it.

05:52.010 --> 05:54.500
Huh? Want this? No?

05:54.700 --> 05:55.670
You had enough?

05:55.870 --> 05:58.690
What's that face?
What's that face?

06:00.620 --> 06:03.510
Looks like some major league
adulting going on over there.
Mm.

06:03.710 --> 06:05.680
My dad has
been on me.

06:05.880 --> 06:06.880
Wants us to finish up
all the will

06:07.080 --> 06:08.610
and living trust stuff.

06:08.810 --> 06:10.180
I thought we already signed it.

06:10.380 --> 06:11.450
Not all of it.

06:11.650 --> 06:13.770
There's still this.

06:15.770 --> 06:17.320
Guardianship of minors.

06:17.520 --> 06:19.360
Vivienne's barely in this world.

06:19.560 --> 06:20.930
I mean, we just became a family.

06:21.130 --> 06:24.460
I can't bring myself to think
of her growing up without us.

06:24.660 --> 06:25.830
I know, baby.

06:26.030 --> 06:27.670
But this right here?
It's just a precaution.

06:27.870 --> 06:28.670
It's never gonna happen.

06:28.870 --> 06:30.900
I know, it's just...

06:31.100 --> 06:32.540
every thought
that's been in my head

06:32.740 --> 06:33.770
since I found out I was pregnant

06:33.970 --> 06:34.940
has been about...

06:35.140 --> 06:37.510
what our lives will be together,

06:37.710 --> 06:39.410
all the things we're going
to experience with her.

06:39.610 --> 06:43.380
This is a version where
she may never even know us.

06:43.580 --> 06:44.820
Hey, hey, stop that.
Stop that.

06:45.020 --> 06:46.950
It's not gonna happen.

06:47.150 --> 06:49.460
Everything you've dreamed of
for her and us

06:49.660 --> 06:51.320
is all gonna
come true.

06:51.520 --> 06:52.460
Together?

06:52.660 --> 06:54.190
Together.

06:54.390 --> 06:55.790
(both chuckle)

06:55.990 --> 06:58.200
You never panic, do you?
Hmm.

06:58.400 --> 07:01.400
I'm kind of saving it for
when Vivienne starts dating.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.340
(laughter)

07:03.540 --> 07:05.770
Hey, for real.

07:05.970 --> 07:07.170
The only guardians
that little Vivienne

07:07.370 --> 07:09.160
is gonna need are right here
in this room.

07:10.460 --> 07:11.790
(phone buzzing)

07:12.730 --> 07:14.460
The boss.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.300
Commander. What's up?

07:18.230 --> 07:20.720
All right, I'm on my way.

07:20.920 --> 07:22.220
I'm sorry, baby, I got to go.

07:22.420 --> 07:23.690
All right, look, let's put
all this away for now.

07:23.890 --> 07:25.370
All right? We'll get
back to it later.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.060
I love you.
Love you, too.

07:28.260 --> 07:29.410
All right.

07:35.250 --> 07:37.890
(helicopter whirring,
indistinct radio chatter)

07:45.430 --> 07:46.680
Hondo.

07:46.880 --> 07:48.730
In there.

07:51.970 --> 07:54.590
DEA Agent Red Corby.

07:54.790 --> 07:56.050
He's part of Agent Boyle's team.

07:56.250 --> 07:57.620
Where are we on the shooter?

07:57.820 --> 07:58.960
Cleaning lady's a witness.

07:59.160 --> 08:00.830
Described four men,
Spanish-speaking.

08:01.030 --> 08:02.730
Busted in, overpowered Red.

08:02.930 --> 08:03.960
Executed him.

08:04.160 --> 08:05.660
Where was she hiding?

08:05.860 --> 08:06.700
Well, that's the thing.

08:06.900 --> 08:07.730
She wasn't.

08:07.930 --> 08:08.800
They made her watch.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.200
She saw the whole thing.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.490
They wanted us
to know who did it.

08:17.560 --> 08:18.780
Sancho Zamora?

08:18.980 --> 08:20.380
That's Ulan's father.

08:20.580 --> 08:21.810
Head of the cartel,

08:22.010 --> 08:23.350
hasn't been out of Mexico
in over 30 years.

08:23.550 --> 08:25.220
This guy's as ruthless
as they come,

08:25.420 --> 08:27.990
oversees an army of dangerous
<i>sicarios,</i> smugglers.

08:28.190 --> 08:30.360
He personally gave
the housekeeper a message

08:30.560 --> 08:31.590
to pass along.

08:31.790 --> 08:32.730
He's coming after
the DEA agents

08:32.930 --> 08:33.890
who murdered his son.

08:34.090 --> 08:35.860
Is that word for word?

08:36.060 --> 08:37.660
"Coming after the DEA"?

08:37.860 --> 08:39.000
I know what
you're thinking, Hondo.

08:39.200 --> 08:40.930
Sir, the DEA set the trap,

08:41.130 --> 08:43.670
but I'm the one
who killed Ulan Zamora.

08:43.870 --> 08:45.140
Sancho Zamora might
not know it yet,

08:45.340 --> 08:47.170
but his road to revenge
ends with me.

08:47.370 --> 08:48.490
Yeah.

08:52.630 --> 08:54.860
* *

09:29.870 --> 09:31.220
(door opens)

09:31.420 --> 09:33.120
I've been in touch with the
Deputy Administrator at the DEA.

09:33.320 --> 09:35.490
This is everything they
have on Sancho Zamora

09:35.690 --> 09:36.920
and the Zamora cartel.

09:37.120 --> 09:38.890
<i>Sicarios,</i> hackers,
dealers and more.

09:39.090 --> 09:40.730
When you said an army,
you weren't lying.

09:40.930 --> 09:42.560
Zamora is a real
big fish for the DEA.

09:42.760 --> 09:43.830
Top of the food chain.

09:44.030 --> 09:45.460
How'd the cartel find out
where Red lived?

09:45.660 --> 09:47.200
That's protected information.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.230
Well, two days ago, there was
a network failure at the DEA HQ

09:49.430 --> 09:50.900
in Little Tokyo.
Servers were down for hours.

09:51.100 --> 09:53.210
More than likely a result
of a malicious hack.

09:53.410 --> 09:54.610
So all their case files

09:54.810 --> 09:56.440
and agent dossiers,
they were potentially exposed?

09:56.640 --> 09:57.880
Wait, hold up.

09:58.080 --> 09:59.610
If Zamora read
the joint operations reports,

09:59.810 --> 10:01.350
he has to know that
I'm the one who shot his son,

10:01.550 --> 10:02.920
which means Nichelle
and Vivienne...

10:03.120 --> 10:04.020
They're already being brought
in by an R100 detail.

10:04.220 --> 10:05.350
They're safe.

10:05.550 --> 10:06.650
Look, the only way
to stop this threat

10:06.850 --> 10:08.150
is to cut the head
off that snake.

10:08.350 --> 10:09.920
Well, the DEA's already
reached out to border agents

10:10.120 --> 10:11.390
and Mexican authorities
for intel

10:11.590 --> 10:13.360
on where Zamora
might hide in L.A.

10:13.560 --> 10:14.930
Soon as we hear
anything, we'll move.

10:15.130 --> 10:16.560
What's status on
the rest of Boyle's team?

10:16.760 --> 10:17.930
Feds've pulled in Agent Fisk
and her family.

10:18.130 --> 10:19.770
Agent Doffing is
away on assignment.

10:19.970 --> 10:21.670
They got word to him.
He's locked down.

10:21.870 --> 10:23.070
And the team leader?
Agent Boyle?

10:23.270 --> 10:24.940
Not answering his cell
and wasn't at home,

10:25.140 --> 10:27.870
but my DEA liaison says they're
still hoping for the best.

10:28.070 --> 10:29.040
(phone buzzing)

10:29.240 --> 10:30.880
Sir, Nichelle and
my daughter are here.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.310
All right, go.

10:32.510 --> 10:33.310
All right, we need to
get Agent Boyle's picture

10:33.510 --> 10:34.480
out to every precinct.

10:34.680 --> 10:35.710
Between the LAPD

10:35.910 --> 10:36.780
and the DEA,
we need to find him

10:36.980 --> 10:39.100
before Sancho
Zamora does.

10:46.340 --> 10:47.560
Baby.

10:47.760 --> 10:48.960
Hondo, what's going on?

10:49.160 --> 10:50.900
Why did you send an escort
to bring us in?

10:51.100 --> 10:53.800
Baby, listen, it was Commander
Hicks' call, just a precaution.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.870
The Zamora cartel
is back in town.

10:56.070 --> 10:57.940
Just want to be extra
safe. It's no big deal.
(sighs)

10:58.140 --> 10:59.970
Hey, you got to do
better than that.

11:00.170 --> 11:02.140
We wouldn't be here
if you weren't in danger.

11:02.340 --> 11:03.810
What are not you telling me?

11:04.010 --> 11:05.840
Nichelle, I need you to trust
that everything's gonna be okay.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.610
You're only gonna be
here for a few hours,

11:07.810 --> 11:09.010
then everything
goes back to normal.

11:09.210 --> 11:11.880
(sighs) All right.
I'll trust you.

11:12.080 --> 11:13.190
Okay, good.

11:13.390 --> 11:15.300
Dr. Wendy can't wait
to meet our little baby.

11:16.040 --> 11:17.920
She's waiting for you
in her office.

11:18.120 --> 11:19.510
(Vivienne coos)

11:24.350 --> 11:25.330
Be safe.

11:25.530 --> 11:28.520
I'll see you later.
Okay.

11:33.490 --> 11:34.740
Yo, what's all this?

11:34.940 --> 11:36.470
Trying to locate Agent Boyle.

11:36.670 --> 11:37.780
DEA's searching all
the normal routes:

11:37.980 --> 11:39.880
phone, credit cards,
traffic cams.

11:40.080 --> 11:41.510
Thought I'd try
something different.

11:41.710 --> 11:43.050
You're tracking Boyle's
social media?

11:43.250 --> 11:45.480
Yeah. Problem is, he's not
exactly an influencer.

11:45.680 --> 11:46.890
Guy keeps a low profile.

11:47.090 --> 11:47.920
Is that his son?

11:48.120 --> 11:50.090
Yeah. Braden. Boyle's divorced.

11:50.290 --> 11:51.520
DEA brought his ex-wife in,

11:51.720 --> 11:52.860
but Boyle's got
custody today

11:53.060 --> 11:54.260
and she doesn't know
where he took the kid.

11:54.460 --> 11:55.190
Apparently, he keeps
his cell phone off

11:55.390 --> 11:56.590
when they're together.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.030
He makes a real effort
to be totally present.

11:58.230 --> 11:59.530
Picked the wrong day
to be a good dad.

11:59.730 --> 12:01.330
You try running a scan
for Braden?

12:01.530 --> 12:04.570
A 12-year-old's probably got
more of a social media presence.

12:04.770 --> 12:06.070
Is that Marcos's WITSEC deal?

12:06.270 --> 12:08.240
Yeah. Just need
a couple of John Hancocks.

12:08.440 --> 12:09.610
Luca, come on.

12:09.810 --> 12:11.580
Marcos basically told us
to eff off this morning.

12:11.780 --> 12:13.080
Look, he was upset.
Grieving, okay?

12:13.280 --> 12:15.210
He's not thinking straight.
He'll come around.

12:15.410 --> 12:16.580
What if he doesn't?

12:16.780 --> 12:17.720
Look, we promised
him a chance

12:17.920 --> 12:19.080
at a better life.
Muriel, too.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.790
We can't just take that away
after what happened.

12:20.990 --> 12:23.660
Luca, what happened to Shorty
was not our fault.

12:23.860 --> 12:25.160
But we can still do this.

12:25.360 --> 12:28.360
Look, it is noble how much
you want to help Marcos.

12:28.560 --> 12:29.660
But you can't save someone

12:29.860 --> 12:31.000
who isn't willing
to save themselves.

12:31.200 --> 12:32.330
I ain't giving up.

12:32.530 --> 12:33.770
Oh, yo, check this out.

12:33.970 --> 12:35.900
Someone just tagged
Boyle's kid in a photo.

12:36.100 --> 12:38.500
STREET: Boyle took him
to play soccer, maybe.

12:38.700 --> 12:40.070
Okay, this post is
from 20 minutes ago.

12:40.270 --> 12:41.440
They could still be there.
We got to find this park.

12:41.640 --> 12:43.790
Let me try this.

12:58.170 --> 13:00.230
Canvass report from this
morning's crime scene came back.

13:00.430 --> 13:03.660
The neighbor's Ring camera
caught a black SUV fleeing

13:03.860 --> 13:05.130
Agent Corby's street
after his murder.

13:05.330 --> 13:06.160
Powell's got a BOLO out.

13:06.360 --> 13:08.270
Good. Maybe we'll get lucky.

13:08.470 --> 13:09.820
Is that <i>the</i> letter?

13:11.150 --> 13:12.170
Boss...

13:12.370 --> 13:13.340
don't let your mind
go to the worst.

13:13.540 --> 13:14.540
We'll get ahead of this cartel.

13:14.740 --> 13:17.130
Tan, it's not that.

13:18.530 --> 13:20.050
Nichelle and I were talking
this morning about

13:20.250 --> 13:21.780
what would happen to Vivienne
if both of us were gone.

13:21.980 --> 13:23.520
And it just
got me thinking

13:23.720 --> 13:24.850
how much my life has changed

13:25.050 --> 13:26.920
since I wrote this letter
a year ago.

13:27.120 --> 13:28.390
You know it's bad luck to talk
about the letter.

13:28.590 --> 13:30.720
Yeah, I know the superstition.

13:30.920 --> 13:33.140
(sighs) But if things
did go bad today...

13:34.110 --> 13:35.990
...she'd be reading
this letter tonight.

13:36.190 --> 13:37.900
I mean, I haven't gotten
around to updating it.

13:38.100 --> 13:39.700
I don't even know
where I'd start.

13:39.900 --> 13:41.370
There's so much
that I'd want to say.

13:41.570 --> 13:42.400
Can't help you there.

13:42.600 --> 13:43.670
Tell you the truth,

13:43.870 --> 13:45.120
my letter's still
addressed to Bonnie.

13:46.290 --> 13:47.410
Haven't changed it

13:47.610 --> 13:48.710
'cause it's like a time capsule

13:48.910 --> 13:50.280
of how I felt
when things were good.

13:50.480 --> 13:52.540
You'll find somebody else, man.

13:52.740 --> 13:54.010
And, besides, neither one of us

13:54.210 --> 13:55.780
is gonna have to use
this letter anyway, right?

13:55.980 --> 13:58.380
The one we don't speak of?
What letter?

13:58.580 --> 14:00.170
(chuckles softly)

14:07.310 --> 14:08.780
(sighs)

14:12.750 --> 14:15.300
Been thinking about
our conversation earlier,

14:15.500 --> 14:17.140
about trying
to contact my son.

14:17.340 --> 14:21.140
Sorry if it felt like
I shut down on you.

14:21.340 --> 14:22.540
No need to apologize.

14:22.740 --> 14:24.210
I can't imagine
what it must be like

14:24.410 --> 14:26.340
to have a-a kid
out there somewhere.

14:26.540 --> 14:28.110
And...

14:28.310 --> 14:31.330
I wasn't completely honest
with you.

14:32.800 --> 14:33.650
What do you mean?

14:33.850 --> 14:36.040
Honest about what?

14:36.970 --> 14:39.490
The reason
I haven't tried to find him

14:39.690 --> 14:42.590
since he turned 18
is not because...

14:42.790 --> 14:44.130
I was afraid
that I would hurt him

14:44.330 --> 14:46.800
or disrupt his life
somehow, but...

14:47.000 --> 14:49.940
I'm really just afraid
that I'll get hurt.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.740
You mean if you
reach out and...

14:51.940 --> 14:53.420
What if he's not interested?

14:54.660 --> 14:56.760
What if he doesn't
want to know me?

14:57.630 --> 14:58.860
Okay.

14:59.830 --> 15:01.430
What if he does?

15:03.330 --> 15:04.550
(pagers beeping)

15:04.750 --> 15:08.050
Got a hit on the black SUV
from Agent Corby's house.

15:08.250 --> 15:09.820
That tree cluster in
the background lines up

15:10.020 --> 15:11.320
with the hill formation,
that's got to be the one.

15:11.520 --> 15:14.530
That's Balboa Park, that's
where Boyle's playing soccer.

15:14.730 --> 15:17.060
Traffic cams flagged the SUV
from this morning's shooting.

15:17.260 --> 15:18.900
It's heading north on the 405
near Inglewood.

15:19.100 --> 15:21.200
Wait, 405 north? They could
be headed to Encino.

15:21.400 --> 15:22.700
Boyle's there right now
with his son.

15:22.900 --> 15:24.040
If we're able to find him,
they could've too.

15:24.240 --> 15:25.500
And they've already
got a head start.

15:25.700 --> 15:27.060
Let's move.

15:27.820 --> 15:29.010
BRADEN:
Think fast.

15:29.210 --> 15:30.430
(chuckles)

15:31.360 --> 15:32.810
How do you feel
about milkshakes?

15:33.010 --> 15:35.030
Do you even need to ask?

15:36.160 --> 15:38.370
* *

15:44.710 --> 15:48.090
Braden, I need you to get in
the car and lock the door.

15:48.290 --> 15:49.490
What, Dad? Why?

15:49.690 --> 15:51.780
Get on the floor
and stay put.

15:57.120 --> 15:59.500
Dad, is everything okay?
Stay down. I need
you to stay down.

15:59.700 --> 16:00.920
It's gonna be okay.

16:03.260 --> 16:04.080
Dad, I'm scared.

16:04.280 --> 16:06.060
Stay down, Braden!
Okay!

16:07.660 --> 16:10.100
* *

16:11.170 --> 16:12.930
(gunfire)

16:13.770 --> 16:16.140
(panicked shouting)

16:33.890 --> 16:36.460
(approaching engine, siren)

16:40.230 --> 16:41.410
(gunfire)

16:41.610 --> 16:42.810
All right, Luca, Tan,
you're on crowd control.

16:43.010 --> 16:45.220
Get those people
out of the park.

16:45.420 --> 16:47.520
Deacon, you take Powell--
sweep that row of cars.

16:47.720 --> 16:49.500
Street, on me.
Let's move.

16:50.970 --> 16:52.060
Let's go, everybody.

16:52.260 --> 16:53.530
LAPD!
Clear the area!
LAPD!

16:53.730 --> 16:55.230
Go, go, go!
Let's go, let's go,
let's go.

16:55.430 --> 16:57.850
Come on, everyone, move.
Clear the area, let's go.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.000
20-David. Shots fired on
the north side of the lot.

17:02.200 --> 17:03.500
STREET:
26-David.

17:03.700 --> 17:05.950
Got eyes on the shooter.
He's got Boyle pinned down.

17:07.090 --> 17:09.510
Street, cover. LAPD!
Drop the gun!

17:09.710 --> 17:10.940
(gunfire)

17:11.140 --> 17:13.830
20-David.
One suspect down.

17:18.670 --> 17:19.980
POWELL:
Deacon.

17:20.190 --> 17:21.690
The red Explorer.
That's Boyle's car.

17:21.890 --> 17:23.910
(gunfire)

17:26.610 --> 17:27.760
DEACON:
Braden. Hey.

17:27.960 --> 17:29.530
We're here to help.
Open that door.

17:29.730 --> 17:30.800
You're a cop?
LAPD.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.200
Let's get you
out of here, kiddo.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.800
All right,
that's Officer Powell,

17:35.000 --> 17:36.200
I want you to stay
right behind her.
Okay.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.920
Just follow me. Don't stop
moving till I do, okay?

17:39.690 --> 17:40.540
30-David.

17:40.740 --> 17:41.840
We've got Braden.

17:42.040 --> 17:44.580
26-David, second
suspect located.

17:44.780 --> 17:46.480
LAPD! Get on the ground!

17:46.680 --> 17:47.480
Don't do it!

17:47.680 --> 17:48.650
Drop the gun!

17:48.850 --> 17:49.950
On your stomach,
hands by your side.

17:50.150 --> 17:51.020
On your stomach!

17:51.220 --> 17:53.420
Now! Hands behind your back!

17:53.620 --> 17:55.200
Going hands-on.

17:55.970 --> 17:57.490
Boyle! Are you hurt?

17:57.690 --> 17:58.960
No, no, no, but my son--

17:59.160 --> 18:00.160
No, hey, hey, hey,
Deacon and Powell have him.

18:00.360 --> 18:01.060
He's safe.

18:01.260 --> 18:02.130
We got the two shooters.

18:02.330 --> 18:03.160
No, there were three.

18:03.360 --> 18:05.160
Two in the SUV, one on foot.

18:05.360 --> 18:07.330
20-David, we are still Code 6.

18:07.530 --> 18:09.380
There's one more suspect
out there.

18:10.990 --> 18:14.910
26-David, he's in the black SUV!

18:15.110 --> 18:16.960
TAN: 25-David,
copy, I got him.

18:17.990 --> 18:20.900
Shooting the tire!
(gunfire)

18:26.200 --> 18:28.120
LAPD!
LAPD! Show us your hands!

18:28.320 --> 18:30.620
Get down! Down, on your stomach!

18:30.820 --> 18:32.090
Hands behind your back.

18:32.290 --> 18:34.190
Going hands-on.
LUCA: 22-David,

18:34.390 --> 18:36.490
final suspect in custody.
Show us Code 4.

18:36.690 --> 18:37.700
It's Zamora cartel.

18:37.900 --> 18:39.300
I clocked a tat
on the first guy.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.770
Must be retaliation
for killing Ulan.

18:41.970 --> 18:43.370
We need to warn my team.

18:43.570 --> 18:45.740
Naomi and Ace have already been
brought in. They're safe.

18:45.940 --> 18:47.740
And what about Red?

18:47.940 --> 18:49.720
I'm sorry, man.

18:50.890 --> 18:53.880
Sancho Zamora executed him
in his home this morning.

18:54.080 --> 18:56.110
Sancho Zamora is on U.S. soil.

18:56.310 --> 18:58.050
He came here personally
to get his revenge.

18:58.250 --> 18:59.580
He won't stop.
He'll burn the city.

18:59.780 --> 19:01.190
He'll murder anyone
who gets in his way

19:01.390 --> 19:03.410
until he finds the people
who killed his son.

19:04.370 --> 19:06.670
Not if we get
to him first.

19:13.280 --> 19:14.730
I want full cooperation.
Whatever it takes.

19:14.930 --> 19:16.270
Sancho Zamora hasn't left
Mexico in three decades.

19:16.470 --> 19:18.900
Now he's crossed our border
and killed Red Corby.

19:19.100 --> 19:20.740
Now, men have spent
their entire careers

19:20.940 --> 19:24.380
trying to get cuffs on him.
We cannot let him escape.

19:24.580 --> 19:25.810
What do you got?

19:26.010 --> 19:28.110
Zamora wasn't alone
at Agent Corby's house.

19:28.310 --> 19:30.480
Corby's housekeeper was able
to ID three other suspects

19:30.680 --> 19:31.650
from a photo line-up.

19:31.850 --> 19:33.190
This one goes by Pesado.

19:33.390 --> 19:35.450
He's Zamora's number one
enforcer and head of security.

19:35.650 --> 19:37.760
I'll make sure my people
know he's here, too.

19:37.960 --> 19:39.760
DEA is coordinating with ICE

19:39.960 --> 19:42.060
and Homeland Security
at our borders.

19:42.260 --> 19:44.000
The head of the cartel is
taking a massive risk

19:44.200 --> 19:45.300
just by being here.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.030
I can't imagine he'll
just cut and run.

19:47.230 --> 19:48.630
He's got to have
something else planned.

19:48.830 --> 19:50.500
The two suspects we have
in custody aren't talking,

19:50.700 --> 19:52.270
but one had a burner phone
that we suspect

19:52.470 --> 19:53.710
is how they received orders.

19:53.910 --> 19:55.840
It's encrypted, but once
Cyber Division cracks it,

19:56.040 --> 19:58.110
we can hopefully trace it to
whoever's relaying the orders.

19:58.310 --> 20:00.380
When you connect those burners,
we can trace them

20:00.580 --> 20:01.680
right to Zamora.

20:01.880 --> 20:03.880
We're gonna catch
this son of a bitch.

20:04.080 --> 20:05.820
We got photos
of all four suspects

20:06.020 --> 20:07.520
in Agent Corby's murder
out to Patrol.

20:07.720 --> 20:08.920
Every cop in the city
is looking for them.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.660
Good. We need to find them
and put an end this.

20:10.860 --> 20:12.020
There you are, Commander.

20:12.220 --> 20:13.330
I just got off the phone
with Marcos Guzman.

20:13.530 --> 20:15.030
Luca, you're wasting your time.

20:15.230 --> 20:17.700
No, you're wrong. I got him to
agree to take the WITSEC deal.

20:17.900 --> 20:20.430
Okay, Marcos knows
that Sancho Zamora's here.

20:20.630 --> 20:22.070
After everything he did
to help us,

20:22.270 --> 20:24.840
he wants to protect himself
and his cousin, Muriel, too.

20:25.040 --> 20:26.740
All right, well, you
stuck your neck out

20:26.940 --> 20:28.110
to keep this deal
in place, Luca.

20:28.310 --> 20:29.870
You put in the work
in with Marcos.

20:30.070 --> 20:31.180
Glad it paid off for you.

20:31.380 --> 20:32.410
Okay, he's laying low
in Long Beach

20:32.610 --> 20:33.450
while the cartel are here.

20:33.650 --> 20:34.850
He wants us to come to him.

20:35.050 --> 20:36.580
Long Beach. Why don't he
and Muriel just come here?

20:36.780 --> 20:39.050
They'd be safer.
No, he won't come in
without signed papers.

20:39.250 --> 20:41.390
His trust in us is stretched
pretty thin right now.

20:41.590 --> 20:43.260
All right.
All right, look.

20:43.460 --> 20:45.860
We got time to wait for Cyber
to crack the cartel phone.

20:46.060 --> 20:48.490
You two take a Charger and
get Marcos that paperwork.

20:48.690 --> 20:50.850
Thank you, sir.

20:52.650 --> 20:54.030
(door opens)

20:54.230 --> 20:55.530
Anything from Cyber yet?

20:55.730 --> 20:57.240
No. Last I heard, they're still
working on the burner phones

20:57.440 --> 20:59.500
taken off the <i>sicarios</i>
who attacked Boyle.

20:59.700 --> 21:01.370
These things never
move fast enough.

21:01.570 --> 21:03.020
So what do
you need?

21:03.790 --> 21:06.110
I want you to hold on
to something for me.

21:06.310 --> 21:07.310
The letter?

21:07.510 --> 21:08.980
(chuckles softly)

21:09.180 --> 21:10.580
Look, you...

21:10.780 --> 21:12.180
you need to put that
back in your locker

21:12.380 --> 21:14.920
and let it sit for the next
20 years until you retire.

21:15.120 --> 21:17.720
Sir, Sancho Zamora is here
to avenge his son's death.

21:17.920 --> 21:20.090
And there's no denying
there's a target on my back.

21:20.290 --> 21:24.430
So, please, take it
until we sort things out.

21:24.630 --> 21:25.980
But look...

21:26.910 --> 21:28.300
What's in here
doesn't even come close

21:28.500 --> 21:30.620
to what I'd want to say
to Nichelle if I could.

21:31.750 --> 21:33.570
But it's all I got.

21:33.770 --> 21:35.210
Make sure she knows that,
all right?

21:35.410 --> 21:37.160
Hondo, come on.

21:38.360 --> 21:40.650
As much as I value
SWAT tradition,

21:40.850 --> 21:42.550
this is one I'd
like to see end.

21:42.750 --> 21:43.950
Why's that?

21:44.150 --> 21:46.450
Because who's to say
we'll be the first to go?

21:46.650 --> 21:48.150
I mean, my
generation

21:48.350 --> 21:51.660
wasn't big on... expressing
their feelings, you know?

21:51.860 --> 21:55.230
The problem with that is
there was a lot left unsaid.

21:55.430 --> 21:58.060
And there's things I wrote in my
letter to Barb that I wanted her

21:58.260 --> 21:59.860
to know.

22:00.060 --> 22:01.830
She never got to
read the letter.

22:02.030 --> 22:04.150
And I never told her.

22:05.220 --> 22:06.800
So take it from me--

22:07.000 --> 22:09.740
if there's things you
want to say to Nichelle,

22:09.940 --> 22:13.010
don't hide behind
the letter like I did.

22:13.210 --> 22:14.480
Say them to her.

22:14.680 --> 22:16.210
Out loud.

22:16.410 --> 22:18.170
(phone buzzes)

22:19.370 --> 22:20.590
Cyber cracked
the <i>sicario's</i> phone.

22:20.790 --> 22:21.970
They're sending
the data now.

22:27.610 --> 22:28.730
What do you got?

22:28.930 --> 22:30.060
Not a lot of data on the phone,

22:30.260 --> 22:31.800
but that actually
works in our favor.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.700
Only one other phone has
been in contact with this one

22:33.900 --> 22:35.070
since it
was activated.

22:35.270 --> 22:36.830
Most recently, a text
directing the <i>sicarios</i>

22:37.030 --> 22:38.770
to Encino.
Sounds like whoever
has the other phone's

22:38.970 --> 22:41.040
calling the shots.
Which means it
could be Zamora.

22:41.240 --> 22:43.040
Run a trace,
tell me where it is.
Already running it.

22:43.240 --> 22:45.280
BOYLE:
Looks like
it's down in Long Beach.

22:45.480 --> 22:46.810
Long Beach? Where?

22:47.010 --> 22:48.110
The decommissioned
power plant.
HICKS: Pull up a locator

22:48.310 --> 22:50.010
on Street and
Luca's Charger, now.

22:50.210 --> 22:52.050
Sir, what's going on?
Street and Luca
went to Long Beach

22:52.250 --> 22:53.950
to meet up with
Marcos and Muriel.

22:54.150 --> 22:56.420
Muriel is carrying
Sancho's grandson.
HONDO: If the cartel

22:56.620 --> 22:58.690
figured that out, then she
and Marcos could be the target.

22:58.890 --> 23:00.660
Luca and Street just rolled
into the power plant.

23:00.860 --> 23:03.910
* *

23:09.550 --> 23:11.170
LUCA:
Yo.
(car doors shut)

23:11.370 --> 23:12.340
We're here.

23:12.540 --> 23:14.790
Hey, you made
the right choice, bro.

23:15.720 --> 23:16.570
Where's Muriel?

23:16.770 --> 23:18.610
Let's just get this done.

23:18.810 --> 23:20.550
(phone buzzes)

23:20.750 --> 23:22.350
Yo, Hondo.
What's up?
HONDO: Luca,

23:22.550 --> 23:24.150
we tracked the cartel's phone
to your location.

23:24.350 --> 23:25.150
Zamora could be

23:25.350 --> 23:26.850
going after
Muriel and Marcos.

23:27.050 --> 23:27.990
You need to grab them
and get out of there.

23:28.190 --> 23:29.740
STREET: Luca!
(gunfire)

23:31.470 --> 23:32.820
Hondo, we
got company!

23:33.020 --> 23:34.530
All hell is breaking loose!
Bullets everywhere!

23:34.730 --> 23:35.530
Back to the car!

23:35.730 --> 23:37.380
(gunfire continues)

23:44.320 --> 23:46.140
Luca! Street!
LUCA:
Hey! Zamoras are here!

23:46.340 --> 23:48.910
They just took out our car
with an RPG!

23:49.110 --> 23:50.270
(groaning)
Street's injured!

23:50.470 --> 23:52.010
He's got a piece of shrapnel
in his leg!

23:52.210 --> 23:54.060
(groans) Sounds like they're
sitting ducks out there.

23:54.700 --> 23:56.150
We got to get to cover!
Hey!

23:56.350 --> 23:58.550
Marcos, get up! The plant! Go!

23:58.750 --> 23:59.750
Luca!
LUCA: Hondo, we're gonna

23:59.950 --> 24:01.190
hold 'em off
as long as we can!

24:01.390 --> 24:02.720
We're heading inside the plant.
Go, go, go.

24:02.920 --> 24:03.920
Luca. We're going. Go.
(gunfire continues)

24:04.120 --> 24:06.290
We're on our way!
I'm coming with you!

24:06.490 --> 24:08.460
We can handle this, Boyle.
Due respect, they
killed my friend.

24:08.660 --> 24:10.380
Let me help bring yours
home. I owe you that much.

24:10.880 --> 24:11.900
Fine. Take the chopper.

24:12.100 --> 24:13.880
I'll scramble backup. Go!

24:15.380 --> 24:16.670
(Street groaning)

24:16.870 --> 24:18.240
I counted three of
'em, maybe more.

24:18.440 --> 24:20.100
We can't stay here.

24:20.300 --> 24:21.910
Okay, Hondo,
we're inside right now.

24:22.110 --> 24:24.910
Hondo? Aw, there's no signal.
Must be the building.

24:25.110 --> 24:26.910
We got to get moving,
find a place to barricade.

24:27.110 --> 24:28.150
Can't go that way.
Come on, Marcos.

24:28.350 --> 24:29.880
What are you doing?
STREET: Come on.

24:30.080 --> 24:31.150
I ain't going with you.
What are you
talking about,

24:31.350 --> 24:32.420
Marcos? We just need
to hold them off.

24:32.620 --> 24:34.350
No. <i>You</i> need to.

24:34.550 --> 24:36.790
Marcos, what did you do?

24:36.990 --> 24:38.290
Look, they took Muriel.

24:38.490 --> 24:40.020
Sancho knew
about the baby, the wire,

24:40.220 --> 24:41.760
everything!
Oh, my God.
You set us up?

24:41.960 --> 24:43.030
A trade.

24:43.230 --> 24:44.830
My cousin for the cops
who killed his son.

24:45.030 --> 24:46.130
How could you do that?!
You should've told me!

24:46.330 --> 24:48.150
I could've helped you
get her back!

24:49.450 --> 24:51.600
Man, trusting you was
what got Shorty killed!

24:51.800 --> 24:54.270
I got to look out
for me and mine!
(man shouts in Spanish)

24:54.470 --> 24:56.740
(panting) Luca, come
on. Luca, come on!
(men speaking Spanish)

24:56.940 --> 24:58.790
We got to go!
Now! Come on.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.180
Coming out!

25:02.380 --> 25:03.250
Hey, don't shoot!

25:03.450 --> 25:05.970
Don't shoot.
Zamora's expecting me.

25:11.570 --> 25:12.690
Marcos!

25:12.890 --> 25:14.460
Muriel.
(chuckles softly)

25:14.660 --> 25:17.830
Hey, hey.
Move out the way.
Give me my cousin.

25:18.030 --> 25:19.000
SANCHO:
No, no, no, no, no.

25:19.200 --> 25:20.600
Not until I have them.

25:20.800 --> 25:22.850
(speaks Spanish)

25:29.090 --> 25:31.060
Damn it.
Still no service in here.

25:32.560 --> 25:33.600
(Street groans)

25:34.400 --> 25:35.780
LUCA:
We need to deal with your leg.

25:35.980 --> 25:37.650
You're bleeding
pretty bad.

25:37.850 --> 25:39.020
Okay?

25:39.220 --> 25:40.590
Looks like there's a piece
of shrapnel in there.

25:40.790 --> 25:42.820
I can't chance
pulling it out, though.
(panting)

25:43.020 --> 25:44.540
I got to tourniquet you.

25:46.040 --> 25:47.020
I'm gonna pull it tight.

25:47.220 --> 25:48.290
Yep.
This is gonna hurt.

25:48.490 --> 25:49.690
Yep.
Okay.

25:49.890 --> 25:51.350
Ready?
(groans loudly)

25:52.310 --> 25:54.330
This is all my fault. I'm sorry.

25:54.530 --> 25:56.500
Hey, he tricked
both of us, okay?

25:56.700 --> 25:58.570
You didn't twist my
arm to come down here.

25:58.770 --> 25:59.740
(men speaking Spanish)

25:59.940 --> 26:00.910
Come on. Let's go.

26:01.110 --> 26:03.160
(groans, panting)

26:04.390 --> 26:06.780
I still can't reach Luca
and Street.

26:06.980 --> 26:08.910
POWELL:
<i>No cell service where they are!</i>

26:09.110 --> 26:10.580
They don't have a lot of time.

26:10.780 --> 26:11.980
HONDO:
Commander, we still have

26:12.180 --> 26:13.750
the <i>sicario's</i> burner phone,
right?

26:13.950 --> 26:15.520
The one we traced
to the plant?

26:15.720 --> 26:16.520
Call it!

26:16.720 --> 26:17.920
Patch me through!

26:18.120 --> 26:19.320
What are you thinking?

26:19.520 --> 26:22.240
It's a Hail Mary, but we got
to buy 'em some time.

26:23.140 --> 26:24.460
It's ringing.

26:24.660 --> 26:26.330
Patching you in now.

26:26.530 --> 26:28.120
(phone buzzing)

26:29.320 --> 26:30.840
Hello?

26:31.040 --> 26:33.710
Am I talking
to the man in charge?

26:33.910 --> 26:35.960
Am I talking
to Sancho Zamora?

26:36.760 --> 26:37.840
Yes, you are.

26:38.040 --> 26:39.180
And who is this?

26:39.380 --> 26:41.350
The man who killed your son.

26:41.550 --> 26:43.080
The two cops you have there
with you at the plant,

26:43.280 --> 26:44.880
they ain't got
no part in this.

26:45.080 --> 26:46.320
I'm the one you want.

26:46.520 --> 26:47.650
I'm on my way.

26:47.850 --> 26:49.190
Good.

26:49.390 --> 26:51.990
I'm still going
to kill your men.

26:52.190 --> 26:53.960
When you come here,

26:54.160 --> 26:56.510
I will kill you, too.

27:03.480 --> 27:05.170
* *

27:05.370 --> 27:06.240
TAN:
All right,
Zamora knows

27:06.440 --> 27:07.340
we're coming.
He's gonna have

27:07.540 --> 27:08.410
a fortified position.

27:08.610 --> 27:10.210
Chopper's fast, but it's loud.

27:10.410 --> 27:12.010
As soon as we get close,
they're gonna hear us.

27:12.210 --> 27:13.950
Boyle's right. We
can deploy quickly,

27:14.150 --> 27:17.410
but if they've got guns waiting,
we'll be sitting ducks.

27:17.610 --> 27:18.970
Which is why we need a plan.

27:22.200 --> 27:24.720
I'll have units hold a perimeter
out of sight of the plant.

27:24.920 --> 27:26.790
Drop that bird on the two side.

27:26.990 --> 27:28.610
You can use the building
as cover.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.430
60 seconds out!

27:32.630 --> 27:34.830
So what's the plan?

27:35.030 --> 27:37.650
We drop right
on top of 'em.

27:39.550 --> 27:41.490
(grunting)

27:45.460 --> 27:46.440
Let's go.

27:46.640 --> 27:47.440
(grunts)

27:47.640 --> 27:49.800
(grunting)

27:50.630 --> 27:52.080
Okay.
(groaning softly)

27:52.280 --> 27:54.420
You were bleeding
pretty bad on the way in.

27:54.620 --> 27:56.070
Pretty sure we're gonna have
company soon.

27:57.300 --> 27:58.220
(groans)

27:58.420 --> 27:59.360
Okay, how you holding up?

27:59.560 --> 28:00.960
Hurts like hell,
but I'll survive.

28:01.160 --> 28:03.060
Man, I'm so sorry I didn't
listen to you about Marcos.

28:03.260 --> 28:04.900
I'll never forgive myself
for this.
(panting)

28:05.100 --> 28:07.630
Yeah, well, probably be dead
in a couple minutes,

28:07.830 --> 28:10.130
so you won't have
to carry that for long.
Dude, how can you joke

28:10.330 --> 28:11.940
like that, all right?
You got a hole in your leg

28:12.140 --> 28:13.500
'cause of me.
You should be pissed.

28:13.700 --> 28:15.040
At what?

28:15.240 --> 28:16.270
Luca,

28:16.470 --> 28:18.280
the only thing
you're ever guilty of

28:18.480 --> 28:20.410
is seeing the good in people
and never giving up on 'em.

28:20.610 --> 28:22.860
I could never hold
that against you.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.320
Thanks, man. Really.

28:26.520 --> 28:28.240
Yeah.

28:30.840 --> 28:32.190
MARCOS:
Look, I got
them here, man.

28:32.390 --> 28:34.460
You said you'd let me
and my cousin go.

28:34.660 --> 28:36.130
That was the deal.
Well, next time,

28:36.330 --> 28:37.330
you'll be more careful
who you make deals with.

28:37.530 --> 28:39.330
No. No more next time.

28:39.530 --> 28:41.430
You wore a wire
for the cops.

28:41.630 --> 28:43.330
And you lured my son
into a trap.

28:43.530 --> 28:46.440
You die, too, Marcos.

28:46.640 --> 28:47.470
(helicopter blades whirring)

28:47.670 --> 28:49.270
They're here.

28:49.470 --> 28:50.370
Hold him.

28:50.570 --> 28:52.330
Find me those
two cops!

28:55.630 --> 28:57.180
Hey, cavalry's here.

28:57.380 --> 28:58.720
(banging)

28:58.920 --> 29:01.620
Zamora's guys are breaking in.
Street, get up.

29:01.820 --> 29:03.990
(grunts)
Hopefully we can
buy enough time.

29:04.190 --> 29:06.110
We'll hold 'em off as long
as we can. Then we go together.

29:07.740 --> 29:09.480
(gunshots)

29:10.140 --> 29:11.700
I got one. He's
got more with him.

29:11.900 --> 29:12.930
All right, I'll go around.

29:13.130 --> 29:14.920
(panting)

29:15.750 --> 29:17.280
(automatic gunfire)

29:20.490 --> 29:21.890
(gunshot)

29:22.490 --> 29:24.680
(men shouting in Spanish)
LUCA: Second one down.

29:24.880 --> 29:26.960
More are coming.
We got to get out of here.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.100
(grunts)
Come on.

29:31.670 --> 29:33.100
(door closes)

29:34.500 --> 29:36.740
* *

29:45.710 --> 29:47.380
HONDO:
We're clear! Go, go, go!

29:48.780 --> 29:50.650
(automatic gunfire)

29:56.620 --> 29:58.860
They're inside!
Go get 'em!

29:59.630 --> 30:01.860
* *

30:18.710 --> 30:20.150
(Street groans)
(Luca grunts)

30:21.020 --> 30:22.330
LUCA:
Whoa, hold up.
That's Marcos.

30:22.530 --> 30:24.020
Come on.
Go, go, go. Go.

30:24.790 --> 30:26.200
Luca, what the hell
are you doing?

30:26.400 --> 30:27.870
You got to get your ass outside.
As much as you'd deserve it,

30:28.070 --> 30:30.690
Marcos, we're not leaving
you behind. Come on.

30:38.570 --> 30:40.750
Marcos, get Street
out of here.

30:40.950 --> 30:42.350
Hey, wait, what?
We're not splitting up.

30:42.550 --> 30:44.360
No time to argue, okay? They'll
catch us if we stay together.

30:44.560 --> 30:47.390
But not if I lead 'em away.
Go, go. Get him to safety.
Luca. Luca.

30:47.590 --> 30:48.390
(groans)

30:48.590 --> 30:50.780
* *

30:57.150 --> 30:58.600
Get down.
Hands. Hands.

30:58.800 --> 30:59.840
POWELL:
Hands.

31:00.040 --> 31:01.270
TAN:
Give me your hands.

31:01.470 --> 31:03.210
Tan, Powell,
get 'em out of the way.

31:03.410 --> 31:04.480
Now. Move.

31:04.680 --> 31:06.110
LAPD! Don't move!

31:06.310 --> 31:08.110
Hondo, it's me. It's
Street. It's Street.

31:08.310 --> 31:09.710
Street, you good?
I'll be fine.

31:09.910 --> 31:11.150
You got to find
Luca. He went off

31:11.350 --> 31:13.350
on his own to lure
Sancho's men away from us.

31:13.550 --> 31:14.620
All right,
Tan, Powell,

31:14.820 --> 31:16.490
get Marcos and Street outside.

31:16.690 --> 31:17.650
Deacon, we're going after Luca.

31:17.850 --> 31:18.920
HICKS:
Command to 20-David,

31:19.120 --> 31:20.760
Sancho Zamora's back
on the line.

31:20.960 --> 31:22.090
Patching him through.

31:22.290 --> 31:24.430
HONDO:
You ready to surrender, Zamora?

31:24.630 --> 31:27.560
Why would I surrender
when I have your man,

31:27.760 --> 31:29.570
Dominique Luca,

31:29.770 --> 31:31.040
right here?
Anything happens to him,

31:31.240 --> 31:33.240
I promise, you ain't
getting out of here alive.

31:33.440 --> 31:34.240
Listen to me,

31:34.440 --> 31:35.440
I'm the one you want.

31:35.640 --> 31:37.170
Let my guy go.
I'll take his place.

31:37.370 --> 31:38.180
No, no, no, no.

31:38.380 --> 31:39.440
What did he
just say?

31:39.640 --> 31:41.380
Nichelle, you can't be in here.
Hondo!

31:41.580 --> 31:44.250
Nichelle. Nichelle.
I will explain to you later.
What is going on?

31:44.450 --> 31:46.380
Come on, now.
You can't be in here.
(breathing heavily)

31:46.580 --> 31:48.250
I'll sweeten the deal for you.

31:48.450 --> 31:49.520
You and me.

31:49.720 --> 31:50.590
We get on the chopper,

31:50.790 --> 31:52.220
I get you to
the border.

31:52.420 --> 31:54.090
But Luca walks away
from all of this. You hear me?

31:54.290 --> 31:58.360
I am not a
patient man, Hondo.

31:58.560 --> 32:00.360
You have five minutes.

32:00.560 --> 32:02.500
One second more,

32:02.700 --> 32:04.850
Officer
Luca dies.

32:06.450 --> 32:07.540
Hondo, what are you doing?

32:07.740 --> 32:09.970
I'm playing the cards
we were dealt.

32:10.170 --> 32:11.740
There's no way I'm letting
a member of my squad

32:11.940 --> 32:13.180
take a bullet
that was meant for me.

32:13.380 --> 32:14.910
Zamora's already
got a hostage.

32:15.110 --> 32:16.910
He's got Luca and Muriel.
You're just adding a third one.

32:17.110 --> 32:18.520
You-you can't do this.

32:18.720 --> 32:21.370
You've got five minutes to
come up with a better plan.

32:31.610 --> 32:32.630
HONDO: All right,
there's the bird.

32:32.830 --> 32:33.800
You don't need
Luca anymore.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.070
It's time to let him go.

32:35.270 --> 32:36.070
Hondo, no.

32:36.270 --> 32:38.120
Not until we are on board.

32:39.050 --> 32:41.870
DEACON:
30-David, I'm locked
on Luca's man.

32:42.070 --> 32:43.210
TAN:
25-David,

32:43.410 --> 32:45.210
I've got Pesado in my sights.
Good to go.

32:45.410 --> 32:46.940
DEACON:
That leaves Sancho to you,
Powell.

32:47.140 --> 32:50.150
28-David, negative.
Luca's in the way.

32:50.350 --> 32:52.780
I've gotta get higher.
Powell, no. There's no time.

32:52.980 --> 32:55.440
Powell!

32:57.900 --> 32:59.090
Why are you so jumpy, Pesado?

32:59.290 --> 33:00.660
You're the one with the gun.

33:00.860 --> 33:02.590
Look, let the girl go.
You don't need her, okay?

33:02.790 --> 33:04.160
I'll go in her place.

33:04.360 --> 33:05.430
You're no good to me.

33:05.630 --> 33:07.930
Muriel, she's carrying
my grandson,

33:08.130 --> 33:09.330
my legacy.

33:09.530 --> 33:13.540
Nothing more important
than legacy.

33:13.740 --> 33:15.440
Except maybe
vengeance.

33:15.640 --> 33:18.490
(powering up)

33:20.030 --> 33:23.280
All three shots have to be
in sync and on target.

33:23.480 --> 33:26.580
Anyone left standing will have
Hondo and Luca point-blank.

33:26.780 --> 33:27.920
28-David in position.

33:28.120 --> 33:30.290
Good visual on Sancho.
On you, Deacon.

33:30.490 --> 33:32.760
On my count. Three, two...

33:32.960 --> 33:34.990
TAN:
25-David, I lost visual
on my suspect.

33:35.190 --> 33:36.390
Our window is closing.

33:36.590 --> 33:37.980
They get on that bird,
they're as good as dead.

33:41.820 --> 33:44.000
Still no good. No shot.

33:44.200 --> 33:46.900
Deacon, I got Pesado
dead to rights.

33:47.100 --> 33:50.240
Boyle.
I'm locked on,
waiting on your call.

33:50.440 --> 33:53.340
Roger that.
On my count.

33:53.540 --> 33:57.180
Three, two, one.

33:57.380 --> 34:00.820
(gunshots)

34:01.020 --> 34:02.940
28-David, target is still up.

34:08.980 --> 34:10.710
It's over!

34:21.490 --> 34:23.310
That was one hell
of a shot.

34:23.510 --> 34:24.580
Well, you saved my life
with Ulan.

34:24.780 --> 34:27.040
Least I could do
to return the favor.

34:27.240 --> 34:29.610
Now with Sancho and Ulan
both off the table,

34:29.810 --> 34:32.120
the Zamora cartel's gotta be
hanging by a thread.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.620
And we plan to cut that thread,

34:33.820 --> 34:35.340
put an end
to the Zamoras for good.

34:36.300 --> 34:39.490
SWAT really deserves
all the credit, so thank you.

34:39.690 --> 34:41.790
To you and to your whole team.

34:41.990 --> 34:43.930
Just glad they can't be
a threat to anyone anymore.
Yeah.

34:44.130 --> 34:46.960
Well, until the next cartel
comes around.
The way of the world.

34:47.160 --> 34:49.150
Always another.
But we'll keep fighting.

34:50.080 --> 34:51.170
Take care.

34:51.370 --> 34:52.990
You, too.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.810
I didn't want it
to end up this way.

35:04.010 --> 35:05.620
I mean, you know that,
right, Marcos?

35:05.820 --> 35:07.220
It is what it is, man.

35:07.420 --> 35:09.790
Look, I'm gonna talk to the DA.

35:09.990 --> 35:12.590
I don't know how much good
it'll do, but it's worth a shot.

35:12.790 --> 35:13.890
Why would you do that?

35:14.090 --> 35:16.130
I sold you out
today, Luca.

35:16.330 --> 35:18.950
Even after I betrayed you,
you still saved me.

35:19.880 --> 35:22.930
Now you say you're gonna
help me out in court?

35:23.130 --> 35:24.240
Why?

35:24.440 --> 35:25.770
Because you're worth it.

35:25.970 --> 35:27.740
Okay?
And your life's not over.

35:27.940 --> 35:29.670
You're a leader, Marcos.

35:29.870 --> 35:32.010
You choose the right path

35:32.210 --> 35:34.600
and others will follow.

35:36.960 --> 35:38.530
Come on.

35:44.810 --> 35:47.610
Come on, let's go.

35:53.010 --> 35:54.970
Let me guess.

35:55.170 --> 35:56.770
You let him off the hook,
didn't you?

35:56.970 --> 35:58.270
Yeah, I guess
I kinda did.

35:58.470 --> 35:59.900
Man, I don't know what
the hell's wrong with me.

36:00.100 --> 36:01.840
Man, nothing's wrong
with you.

36:02.040 --> 36:04.280
It just goes to prove
what I said earlier

36:04.480 --> 36:06.910
about you always
seeing the good,

36:07.110 --> 36:08.980
and never giving up
on people.

36:09.180 --> 36:11.030
Man, no one can
fault you for that.

36:13.700 --> 36:16.320
Thanks, man.
Thanks for today, bro.

36:16.520 --> 36:19.310
HICKS:
Here he comes.

36:28.080 --> 36:30.280
(exhales, inhales)

36:37.660 --> 36:39.280
I know what you did
out there.

36:39.480 --> 36:42.080
You are not allowed to scare me
like that ever again.

36:42.280 --> 36:45.780
Babe, I know what it means
for my family

36:45.980 --> 36:47.470
if I don't come home.

36:48.400 --> 36:51.050
Which is why I would never
do anything without my team

36:51.250 --> 36:53.060
watching my back.

36:53.260 --> 36:54.580
They're family, too.

36:59.910 --> 37:01.470
I'm gonna get our daughter,

37:01.670 --> 37:03.300
and you're gonna take us home.
(chuckles)

37:03.500 --> 37:05.950
Yes, ma'am.

37:09.390 --> 37:10.760
(exhales)

37:12.560 --> 37:14.630
That was a great job out there.

37:16.160 --> 37:17.800
Thank you, sir.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.850
Looks like, uh,

37:24.050 --> 37:25.640
you have time to work on this.

37:26.540 --> 37:27.890
Think about what I said.

37:28.090 --> 37:30.280
I'll see you at the christening.

37:39.790 --> 37:41.640
Yeah, we're over there.
LUCA:
Hey,

37:41.840 --> 37:43.540
the godfather's officially here.

37:43.740 --> 37:45.480
Oh...
Where's my little goddaughter?

37:45.680 --> 37:47.940
Up front being smothered with
affection by her grandparents.

37:48.140 --> 37:49.860
Nice.
Almost showtime.

37:52.070 --> 37:54.150
LUCA:
I'm excited.

37:54.350 --> 37:55.750
You made it.
Yeah.

37:55.950 --> 37:57.870
Like you said,
Hondo wanted me here.

38:00.170 --> 38:01.560
Been thinking about
the other thing

38:01.760 --> 38:02.930
you said, too, about my son.

38:03.130 --> 38:06.130
And as much as it would hurt

38:06.330 --> 38:08.300
to find out
he didn't want to know me,

38:08.500 --> 38:10.530
it would be worse
if he went the rest of his life

38:10.730 --> 38:12.070
not knowing that I love him.

38:12.270 --> 38:14.570
I'm glad to hear you say that.

38:14.770 --> 38:16.910
You know,
when an adopted child turns 18,

38:17.110 --> 38:18.480
they've got some options.

38:18.680 --> 38:21.040
One of which is to reach out,
which we know your son hasn't.

38:21.240 --> 38:24.780
But another one is
for them to file paperwork

38:24.980 --> 38:27.920
saying that they'd be
open to contact

38:28.120 --> 38:29.850
from their
birth parent.

38:30.050 --> 38:32.160
So I told Annie
your situation,

38:32.360 --> 38:33.590
and she reached out
to a lawyer friend of hers

38:33.790 --> 38:35.730
who deals with adoptions.

38:35.930 --> 38:38.500
Powell, your son filed
the paperwork.

38:38.700 --> 38:41.160
He'd be open
to hearing from you.

38:41.360 --> 38:43.300
He would?

38:43.500 --> 38:44.640
Yeah.
Really?

38:44.840 --> 38:47.800
Um, here's just some
basic information,

38:48.000 --> 38:49.670
including the number
of Annie's friend.

38:49.870 --> 38:52.010
He'll help you connect.

38:52.210 --> 38:55.080
I... I don't know what to say.

38:55.280 --> 38:57.830
You don't need to say anything.

38:59.730 --> 39:00.750
Thomas. (chuckles)

39:00.950 --> 39:03.450
He goes by Thomas.
Yeah.

39:03.650 --> 39:05.710
That's the name you gave him.

39:07.570 --> 39:08.560
Thank you.

39:08.760 --> 39:10.140
You're welcome.
Thank you.

39:12.910 --> 39:15.670
STREET: Hey, Nichelle,
Hondo's looking for you.

39:15.870 --> 39:17.230
He's out in the,
in the courtyard.

39:17.430 --> 39:19.140
Something about
unexpected flowers.

39:19.340 --> 39:21.890
Oh. Let me go see what's up.
All right.

39:25.790 --> 39:26.840
Wow.

39:27.040 --> 39:29.480
This is gorgeous.

39:29.680 --> 39:32.080
But what is it?

39:32.280 --> 39:35.420
I wanted to do something
special to mark the occasion.

39:35.620 --> 39:37.750
Lilies are your favorite.

39:37.950 --> 39:40.390
Yeah, but this is Vivie's day.

39:40.590 --> 39:43.060
Unless there's another occasion
I'm not aware of.

39:43.260 --> 39:45.660
Nichelle,

39:45.860 --> 39:49.300
a lot has come
into focus for me.

39:49.500 --> 39:53.170
There's a tradition
that we have at SWAT.

39:53.370 --> 39:56.710
We all write letters
to our loved ones...

39:56.910 --> 39:59.480
in case we don't come home.

39:59.680 --> 40:02.010
I got some really good advice:

40:02.210 --> 40:03.580
don't hide behind it.

40:03.780 --> 40:06.450
What were you hiding from?

40:06.650 --> 40:11.190
Baby, I have never felt
more love, more alive

40:11.390 --> 40:13.920
since Vivienne came
into this world,

40:14.120 --> 40:16.280
and I owe all of that to you.

40:17.910 --> 40:21.800
You are the
strongest, smartest,

40:22.000 --> 40:25.400
most inspirational woman
I have ever known.

40:25.600 --> 40:27.740
And now you are
even more than that.

40:27.940 --> 40:30.410
You are the mother
of my child.

40:30.610 --> 40:32.290
My partner.

40:33.690 --> 40:36.680
My always and
everything.

40:36.880 --> 40:39.480
Hondo, what ae you saying?
(chuckles)

40:39.680 --> 40:43.290
Uh, I am trying to say

40:43.490 --> 40:45.490
you and I have been
down a long road together,

40:45.690 --> 40:47.290
and I have loved you
every step of the way.

40:47.490 --> 40:49.690
And then I fell in love
all over again

40:49.890 --> 40:52.350
when I met Vivienne's mom.

40:54.580 --> 40:56.780
It just hit different.

40:57.720 --> 41:00.890
So I know that I need
to do something different.

41:05.590 --> 41:07.430
(exhales)

41:09.530 --> 41:11.200
(sobs)

41:14.470 --> 41:16.850
Nichelle Carmichael...
(exhales sharply)

41:17.050 --> 41:18.660
...will you marry me?

41:18.860 --> 41:21.190
* <i>You're all I need</i> *
* Like sweet morning dew *

41:21.390 --> 41:24.060
* I took one look at you *
* <i>To get by</i> *

41:24.260 --> 41:25.500
* And it was plain to see... *

41:25.700 --> 41:27.330
LUCA:
All right, Hondo!

41:27.530 --> 41:29.300
Oh, wait, wait,
did we jump the gun?
Hold on, you guys knew?

41:29.500 --> 41:31.330
Nobody told me.
DEACON:
It was on a need-to-know basis.

41:31.530 --> 41:34.040
I didn't hear an answer.
Yeah, you saw that kiss, though.

41:34.240 --> 41:36.310
I mean, yeah, you put a little
something extra on that one.

41:36.510 --> 41:38.990
But, um...

41:39.930 --> 41:41.140
I do still need an answer.

41:41.340 --> 41:43.780
I can't wait to marry you.
She said yes!

41:43.980 --> 41:45.350
(all cheering)

41:45.550 --> 41:46.580
(whoops)

41:46.780 --> 41:49.140
(laughter)

41:50.540 --> 41:52.270
Perfect.

41:53.270 --> 41:54.830
HONDO:
Oh, man, I was nervous.

41:55.030 --> 41:56.630
(laughing)

41:56.830 --> 41:57.630
LUCA:
Congrats.

41:57.830 --> 41:59.960
Come here, baby.

42:00.160 --> 42:02.870
POWELL:
Aw...
* <i>You're all I need</i> *

42:03.070 --> 42:04.940
* <i>To get by</i> *

42:05.140 --> 42:07.500
* <i>All I need</i> *
* All *

42:07.700 --> 42:10.260
* <i>To get by</i> *
* Yeah, yeah. *
