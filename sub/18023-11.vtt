00:04.546 --> 00:05.421
Jep:
Look here boys,

00:05.463 --> 00:07.214
we got ourselves
a cowboy.

00:09.718 --> 00:11.260
Nice shooting, Tex.

00:11.302 --> 00:13.220
[groans]

00:14.014 --> 00:15.848
Jase: Man.

00:16.224 --> 00:17.474
Si: Hi.

00:17.517 --> 00:19.727
Godwin: Whew.

00:21.271 --> 00:23.105
>> Okay,
it's killing them.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.982
Okay, what's with
the cowboy hat?

00:25.025 --> 00:26.900
>> I just have an important
announcement.

00:26.943 --> 00:28.402
>> Does it have to
do with the hat?

00:28.445 --> 00:29.445
>> Yes, sir.

00:29.487 --> 00:30.612
>> It does look cool.

00:30.655 --> 00:31.405
>> It is a good
looking hat,

00:31.448 --> 00:32.322
I have to give
him that.

00:32.365 --> 00:32.990
>> It's a cool hat.
>> Yeah.

00:33.992 --> 00:35.576
>> I've always thought
that I would

00:35.618 --> 00:37.453
make a pretty
good cowboy.

00:37.495 --> 00:39.079
I'm pretty good
with guns,

00:39.122 --> 00:40.914
I love to spit and
I look pretty

00:40.957 --> 00:42.499
decent in a poncho.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.668
All right, Iím gonna
state the obvious.

00:44.711 --> 00:48.172
I have the greatest wife
of all time.

00:48.214 --> 00:48.964
>> That's a matter
of opinion,

00:49.007 --> 00:50.090
but continue on.

00:50.133 --> 00:51.592
>> No, that's fact.

00:51.634 --> 00:54.553
On the downside, diseases
ran rampant.

00:54.596 --> 00:58.432
She got me the most
amazing gift.

00:58.475 --> 00:59.892
We're talking cholera.

00:59.934 --> 01:01.477
>> Now, the cowboy
hat is nice.

01:01.519 --> 01:02.644
>> Dysentery.

01:02.687 --> 01:04.146
>> But I mean it
ain't that great.

01:04.189 --> 01:06.273
>> Ten or twelve
different kinds of pox.

01:06.316 --> 01:07.941
She got me-

01:07.984 --> 01:09.943
You lived in the
wild west,

01:09.986 --> 01:11.820
you're fixin' to get
some kind of pox.

01:11.863 --> 01:16.950
A one day, rodeo camp
experience.

01:16.993 --> 01:18.744
So, the rodeo is
actually the

01:18.787 --> 01:20.704
perfect compromise.

01:20.747 --> 01:22.289
I want to be in
a western.

01:22.332 --> 01:23.165
I don't care if I get
killed in the

01:23.208 --> 01:24.458
first five seconds.

01:24.501 --> 01:26.585
Everything about
the wild west,

01:26.628 --> 01:28.212
yet none of
the sickness.

01:28.254 --> 01:30.172
Here's the best
part of this!

01:30.215 --> 01:31.423
Ya'll can all come.

01:31.466 --> 01:32.007
Martin: To the camp?

01:32.050 --> 01:32.841
>> Yeah!

01:32.884 --> 01:33.425
>> I'd be in.

01:33.468 --> 01:34.218
>> Me.

01:34.260 --> 01:35.010
>> I like horses.

01:35.053 --> 01:35.969
>> In.

01:36.012 --> 01:36.553
>> I'm not a big fan
of horses,

01:36.596 --> 01:37.471
but let's do it.

01:37.514 --> 01:38.222
>> Are you scared
of horses?

01:38.264 --> 01:38.889
>> I don't like horses.

01:38.932 --> 01:39.848
>> I like cows.

01:39.891 --> 01:40.682
>> All right,
I tell you what.

01:40.725 --> 01:42.017
You stay here and work.

01:42.060 --> 01:42.851
>> It's on a work day?

01:42.894 --> 01:43.852
>> Yeah.

01:43.895 --> 01:44.686
>> Yeah, it's gotta
be a workday.

01:44.729 --> 01:45.896
>> No, I'm in.
Let's do this.

01:45.939 --> 01:46.814
[laughter]

01:46.856 --> 01:47.940
>> Me too.
>> That was easy.

01:47.982 --> 01:48.732
>> I'm not, I'm not
gonna be

01:48.775 --> 01:49.441
the only one here.

01:49.484 --> 01:50.192
You kidding me?

01:50.235 --> 01:51.068
>> Saddle up, partners.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.069
>> Giddy up.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.028

[barking]

02:07.502 --> 02:08.752
Miss Kay:
Willie,

02:08.795 --> 02:10.254
thanks for bringing
me this extra yarn.

02:10.296 --> 02:11.296
Isn't it pretty?

02:11.339 --> 02:12.673
Willie : Yeah, I
finally found it.

02:12.715 --> 02:14.758
Also, I got your
mail and I put more

02:14.801 --> 02:16.218
dog food out, so...

02:16.261 --> 02:17.344
[claps]

02:17.387 --> 02:18.512
I think I'm done.
You're welcome.

02:18.555 --> 02:19.638
I gotta go back
to work.

02:19.681 --> 02:20.722
Phil:
Well, you might oughta

02:20.765 --> 02:22.349
hang around
just a little bit.

02:22.392 --> 02:23.851
There's a spot as big
as this rug,

02:23.893 --> 02:25.686
thousands of pounds
of crawfish,

02:25.728 --> 02:26.728
all you can eat.

02:26.771 --> 02:27.855
Take care of your
mom, Will,

02:27.897 --> 02:29.106
while I get over
and get on that.

02:29.149 --> 02:29.982
>> I think I just
did everything

02:30.024 --> 02:31.150
I was supposed
to do.

02:31.192 --> 02:32.943
>> I'm usually good
for a date but Will,

02:32.986 --> 02:34.153
take over for me,
dude.

02:34.195 --> 02:35.028
>> Wait a minute.

02:35.071 --> 02:36.280
>> But I wanted
you to go!

02:36.322 --> 02:37.531
>> No dates today.

02:37.574 --> 02:38.740
>> Did he say 'date'?

02:38.783 --> 02:41.827
>> It's not a date
with me, silly.

02:41.870 --> 02:46.165
This is Bobo going to
see his girlfriend.

02:46.207 --> 02:47.374
>> What?

02:47.417 --> 02:49.001
>> I've got a friend
from church who

02:49.043 --> 02:52.254
has the perfect
match for Bobo.

02:52.297 --> 02:53.922
I mean,
sometimes the parents,

02:53.965 --> 02:56.592
you know,
they have to help.

02:56.634 --> 02:58.760
'Cause he's been
making bad choices.

02:58.803 --> 03:00.470
>> Mom, I do not
have time--

03:00.513 --> 03:02.431
>> Bobo is getting ready,
he's excited.

03:02.473 --> 03:03.599
Whoo!

03:03.641 --> 03:06.226
>> To take you and
your dog on a date.

03:06.269 --> 03:09.396
>> Bobo is just interested
in all women.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.607
>> Most dogs, I've discovered,
are the same way.

03:11.649 --> 03:13.108
>> And see,
I'm making a little

03:13.151 --> 03:16.028
sweater thing for
the girlfriend.

03:16.070 --> 03:18.030
And guess what
her name is!

03:18.072 --> 03:18.739
>> I need to go.

03:18.781 --> 03:20.365
>> Princess Apricot.

03:20.408 --> 03:21.992
>> Oh my gosh.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.994
>> Well, Iíll tell you
what I've done.

03:24.037 --> 03:27.206
I've had most of the
neighbors dog fixed.

03:27.832 --> 03:29.333
Because I didn't want
him matched with

03:29.375 --> 03:31.251
somebody he shouldn't
be with.

03:31.294 --> 03:32.628
And it didn't cost that
much money.

03:32.670 --> 03:33.962
Phil will never know.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.465
>> Mom, why don't you just
go by yourself?

03:36.507 --> 03:37.716
>> Because I want
them to know

03:37.759 --> 03:39.676
he comes from
a loving home

03:39.719 --> 03:41.470
with a mom and dad.

03:41.512 --> 03:42.554
>> Okay, I'm gonna
call Jep.

03:42.597 --> 03:44.223
>> Well, your dad
told you that

03:44.265 --> 03:46.183
you need to take
me and you

03:46.226 --> 03:47.643
know we always
taught you to do

03:47.685 --> 03:49.478
what your dad says.

03:49.520 --> 03:50.437
[groans]

03:50.480 --> 03:52.481
I try to be
a good matchmaker,

03:52.523 --> 03:55.150
with people and
dogs, but sometimes

03:55.193 --> 03:56.902
they go with the
wrong kind of women.

03:56.945 --> 03:57.819
That's why
I had to run

03:57.862 --> 03:59.404
him off from
down the street.

03:59.447 --> 04:01.240
Those were not
the marrying kind.

04:01.282 --> 04:02.324
>> Yeah.
Mom, how long

04:02.367 --> 04:03.325
is this gonna take?

04:03.368 --> 04:04.910
>> You know,
the courting process

04:04.953 --> 04:06.245
is very complicated.

04:06.287 --> 04:07.412
>> Mom.

04:07.455 --> 04:10.207
>> Bobo's been excited
all day about this.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.541
I mean,
look at him.

04:13.586 --> 04:16.838
>> This dog humps every
dog he sees.

04:16.881 --> 04:18.924
>> You run a mile and
a half to two miles

04:18.967 --> 04:20.968
at the end of the road
after those women

04:21.010 --> 04:22.427
you shouldn't
even be after.

04:22.470 --> 04:24.388
You want me to
whoop you?

04:26.182 --> 04:27.808
Yeah well, I'm not
gonna do it

04:27.850 --> 04:30.519
if you behave and
go for the right girl.

04:30.561 --> 04:31.520
>> It's the same
speech I got when

04:31.562 --> 04:32.896
I was that age.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.273
[laughs]

04:34.315 --> 04:35.649
All right, well let's just
get this over with.

04:35.692 --> 04:36.775
>> Okay, but I've
got to hurry up

04:36.818 --> 04:37.859
and finish this.

04:37.902 --> 04:39.778
>> Mom, there's no
hurrying up

04:39.821 --> 04:40.570
and finishing crochet.

04:40.613 --> 04:41.822
It takes forever.

04:41.864 --> 04:44.241
>> No, it doesn't if you
let me concentrate.

04:44.284 --> 04:47.953
>> Mom!

04:47.996 --> 04:51.248
[neighing]

04:52.417 --> 04:53.625
>> Boy, I ain't been
on one of

04:53.668 --> 04:54.584
these ranges
in a while.

04:54.627 --> 04:55.836
>> How long has
it been, Godwin?

04:55.878 --> 04:57.838
>> Good night.
Twenty years!

04:57.880 --> 04:59.965
>> Can you imagine
Godwin on a bull?

05:00.008 --> 05:01.466
[laughs]
Si: No!

05:01.509 --> 05:02.342
>> Hey!
There he is!

05:02.385 --> 05:03.135
>> Hey, look out now.

05:03.177 --> 05:03.969
Terry Holland:
Hey guys.

05:04.012 --> 05:04.803
>> What's happening?

05:04.846 --> 05:05.762
>> I'm Terry Holland.

05:05.805 --> 05:06.805
>> How's it going?
>> Hey man.

05:06.848 --> 05:08.015
>> Hey. Welcome to
the High Low Pro

05:08.057 --> 05:09.725
Rodeo Experience.

05:09.767 --> 05:11.393
You guys are gonna
put on one of

05:11.436 --> 05:14.271
the greatest rodeos
that's ever taken place.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.065
>> Well, that'll definitely
be uh, entertaining.

05:17.108 --> 05:18.275
Whether we're
making duck calls

05:18.318 --> 05:22.112
at the shop or riding
horses as cowboys,

05:22.155 --> 05:25.866
I would prefer being
the leader of this crew.

05:25.908 --> 05:26.658
>> Meet my partner here.

05:26.701 --> 05:27.951
This is John Wayne.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.536
[together]
>> John Wayne!

05:29.579 --> 05:30.495
>> You're gonna have
to get up a

05:30.538 --> 05:31.663
little bit closer,
right there.

05:31.706 --> 05:33.415
>> Yeah, I ain't, ain't
a fan of horses.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.917
>> I'll pretty much
be like Yul Brynner

05:35.960 --> 05:37.753
in The Magnificent Seven.

05:37.795 --> 05:38.712
>> I can see we're
gonna have

05:38.755 --> 05:39.629
to work on
our fears.

05:39.672 --> 05:40.714
>> Huh?
No.

05:40.757 --> 05:41.715
>> The problem is...

05:41.758 --> 05:43.091
>> He's scared of horses.

05:43.134 --> 05:45.218
>> We're more like
the mediocre five.

05:45.261 --> 05:46.720
>> He can't reach
me from here.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.221
>> But I'm still
Yul Brynner.

05:48.264 --> 05:50.349
Martin! Quit dashing
my dreams.

05:50.391 --> 05:52.434
Except I have
hair and a beard.

05:52.477 --> 05:53.435
>> So, who's gonna
do what?

05:53.478 --> 05:54.561
Where's my calf roper?

05:54.604 --> 05:55.479
>> I guess that'd be me.

05:55.521 --> 05:56.396
>> Okay.

05:56.439 --> 05:57.230
>> Always wanted
to see what

05:57.273 --> 05:58.523
I could do
with a rope.

05:58.566 --> 05:59.608
[grunting]

05:59.650 --> 06:01.026
>> We actually need
the biggest,

06:01.069 --> 06:03.111
strongest guy to be
the steer wrestler.

06:03.154 --> 06:04.112
>> I got that.

06:04.155 --> 06:05.113
>> We need a barrel
racer which

06:05.156 --> 06:06.907
traditionally is
a lady's event.

06:06.949 --> 06:08.658
>> Oh, thanks!
Perfect!

06:08.701 --> 06:09.701
>> That didn't take long.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.244
>> Godwin, I can
remember back

06:11.287 --> 06:13.246
in the day watching
you ride bulls.

06:13.289 --> 06:15.248
>> I ain't as limber
as I once was.

06:15.291 --> 06:17.793
>> Now, that just leaves
the rodeo clown.

06:17.835 --> 06:18.794
Is anybody--?

06:18.836 --> 06:19.461
>> Si, youíre the
perfect clown.

06:19.504 --> 06:20.837
He likes makeup.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.631
>> Look, here's nothing
wrong with liking makeup!

06:22.673 --> 06:23.298
All right!

06:23.341 --> 06:24.299
>> Agreed.

06:24.342 --> 06:25.675
>> It's playing
make believe.

06:25.718 --> 06:27.135
Look, I don't know
why everyone gets

06:27.178 --> 06:29.137
so hung up on
the real world.

06:29.180 --> 06:31.556
Make believe is
where it's at, okay?

06:31.599 --> 06:33.558
Just think about this,
Having a bad day?

06:33.601 --> 06:35.018
Come to Si-topia.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.228
I like make believe.
Okay.

06:36.270 --> 06:38.814
The real world, you know,
it sucks.

06:38.856 --> 06:40.273
It's the place
where, hey,

06:40.316 --> 06:42.734
tea flows like wine
and your little fat,

06:42.777 --> 06:44.861
chubby nephew
works for you.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.114
I'm over qualified for
rodeo clown, but hey.

06:47.156 --> 06:49.282
>> You gotta get between
the bull and the rider.

06:49.325 --> 06:50.951
>> Maybe I'm
underqualified.

06:50.993 --> 06:51.743
[chuckles]

06:51.786 --> 06:53.036
That sounds dangerous.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.080
In Si-topia, every day
is Saturday

06:55.123 --> 06:57.666
and it's always
nap time.

06:57.708 --> 07:00.293
>> Rodeo ain't church
league softball.

07:00.336 --> 07:01.753
It's just a little
bit dangerous.

07:01.796 --> 07:03.046
So, you guys ready
to do it?

07:03.089 --> 07:04.005
>> Letís do it.

07:04.048 --> 07:05.132
>> Okay, Ain't nothing
left to do

07:05.174 --> 07:06.591
but get it started.
Let's do it.

07:06.634 --> 07:07.926
>> I'm gonna need a rope.

07:07.969 --> 07:09.094
>> He's gonna
need a rope!

07:09.137 --> 07:10.512
>> And he's probably
gonna need a horse.

07:10.555 --> 07:11.930
>> Yee haw!

07:12.223 --> 07:13.098
[shouting]

07:13.141 --> 07:14.307
>> Here we go!

07:14.350 --> 07:15.308
Come here you
big sucker.

07:15.351 --> 07:16.226
[quacking]
[stomping]

07:16.269 --> 07:17.185
Whoa!

07:17.228 --> 07:18.353
[pop]

07:19.147 --> 07:20.772
[laughter]

07:20.815 --> 07:22.274
[screaming]

07:23.443 --> 07:24.818
>> Okay Si, for your
rodeo experience,

07:24.861 --> 07:25.944
we brought the best
rodeo clown in

07:25.987 --> 07:27.904
the business,
Rudy Burns.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.573
>> He was a barrel
clown when I was riding.

07:29.615 --> 07:30.657
>> This oughtta be good.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.033
>> Hey Rudy.
You know Si.

07:32.076 --> 07:33.034
Rudy Burns: Si!

07:33.077 --> 07:34.077
>> Pleasure to
meet you, Rudy.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.370
>> Buddy, this is
your lucky day.

07:35.413 --> 07:36.329
[chuckles]

07:36.372 --> 07:37.581
>> I don't know
about that!

07:37.623 --> 07:39.624
>> We're gonna change
you into a rodeo clown.

07:39.667 --> 07:40.292
>> All right.

07:40.334 --> 07:41.960
>> I gotta see that.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.879
>> Well, this is the
first thing we're gonna do.

07:43.921 --> 07:45.130
We're gonna introduce
you to the barrel.

07:45.173 --> 07:46.339
>> Nice to meet
you, barrel.

07:46.382 --> 07:48.133
>> Would you like
to try this?

07:48.176 --> 07:48.967
>> No.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.886
[laughs]

07:50.928 --> 07:52.846
>> Being a rodeo
clown is hard.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.431
It takes nerves of
steel and you have

07:54.474 --> 07:56.433
to be a certain
kind of crazy.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.310
>> Well, this barrel
here is kind of

07:58.352 --> 07:59.519
an island of safety.

07:59.562 --> 08:00.729
And when the
bulls hit it,

08:00.771 --> 08:02.397
you see the birdies,

08:02.440 --> 08:03.732
but the birdies
will go away.

08:03.774 --> 08:04.691
>> Oh.

08:04.734 --> 08:05.525
>> Rudy's had
a few concussions

08:05.568 --> 08:06.693
in his lifetime.

08:06.736 --> 08:07.903
>> Ya think.

08:07.945 --> 08:09.404
>> I'm not sure
about Si's nerves,

08:09.447 --> 08:11.448
but he's got the
crazy part down.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.574
[laughter]

08:12.617 --> 08:13.492
>> How long have
you been doing this?

08:13.534 --> 08:14.493
>> Forty-six years.

08:14.535 --> 08:15.911
>> Good grief!

08:15.953 --> 08:18.079
>> Rudy has certainly
earned my respect.

08:18.122 --> 08:19.372
>> See, when the
bull gets after you--

08:19.415 --> 08:20.248
>> Yep.

08:20.291 --> 08:21.374
>> You just run
up there,

08:21.417 --> 08:23.710
and just jump up here
like this and go.

08:23.753 --> 08:24.503
>> He's gone, boys!

08:24.545 --> 08:25.629
>> He gone.

08:25.671 --> 08:26.796
>> I have to say,
that's limber!

08:26.839 --> 08:27.839
>> Anybody that's
willing to go

08:27.882 --> 08:29.382
toe to toe with
a fifteen hundred

08:29.425 --> 08:31.510
pound bull and then
go toe to toe with Si...

08:31.552 --> 08:32.719
>> Good grief!

08:32.762 --> 08:35.847
>> That is
one tough clown.

08:35.890 --> 08:36.723
>> Your turn.

08:36.766 --> 08:37.807
>> My turn?

08:37.850 --> 08:39.267
>> This is gonna be
good here.

08:39.310 --> 08:40.894
>> I can't get in
there like that!

08:40.937 --> 08:41.937
>> Well, you just--

08:41.979 --> 08:42.771
[claps]

08:42.813 --> 08:44.022
>> Good grief!

08:44.065 --> 08:45.398
>> It's a barrel.
When the bull hits it,

08:45.441 --> 08:46.650
it's a port-a-potty.

08:46.692 --> 08:48.068
>> I hope they wash
that barrel out.

08:48.110 --> 08:50.028
>> Good grief, boys!

08:50.071 --> 08:51.321
>> I guess not.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.323
>> Here's a human
fact for you, Jack!

08:53.366 --> 08:55.200
The average human
being can fit into

08:55.243 --> 08:58.078
a space about
that big.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.162
>> Get in the
barrel, Si.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.288
>> Get in the barrel.

09:00.331 --> 09:01.164
>> No! One of ya'll
get in the barrel.

09:01.207 --> 09:01.998
>> No.
>> Naw.

09:02.041 --> 09:02.999
>> You're the clown.

09:03.042 --> 09:06.628
[shouts]
[cheering]

09:06.671 --> 09:07.420
[laughter]
[applause]

09:07.463 --> 09:08.171
>> I'm stuck.

09:08.214 --> 09:09.089
>> You did it,Si!

09:09.131 --> 09:10.382
>> I'm sixty-eight
years old.

09:10.424 --> 09:12.008
When you reach
that age,

09:12.051 --> 09:14.553
you do not have
a normal, human body.

09:14.595 --> 09:16.096
[groaning]

09:16.138 --> 09:18.265
You can barely
fit in your car.

09:18.307 --> 09:19.599
[groaning]

09:19.642 --> 09:21.685
Much less, fitting
in a stupid barrel.

09:21.727 --> 09:23.270
Oh, good grief!

09:23.312 --> 09:25.689
I wanna see how
Rudy gets into his car.

09:25.731 --> 09:27.607
I don't see how
you do this.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.109
I bet you any
amount of money

09:29.151 --> 09:32.779
he does a beautiful swan
dive through the sun roof.

09:32.822 --> 09:33.655
Whoa!

09:33.698 --> 09:34.531
>> He's out.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.575
>> Well, I gotta
say, sir--

09:36.617 --> 09:37.742
>> Oh.
Here comes the--

09:37.785 --> 09:39.578
>> My hat's off to you.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.162
>> Mine is off to you.

09:41.205 --> 09:43.248
>> Good grief!

09:46.085 --> 09:52.716
[upbeat music]

09:52.758 --> 09:53.925
>> Hey.
How are you?

09:53.968 --> 09:54.968
>> Fine.

09:55.011 --> 09:55.844
>> Come on in.

09:55.886 --> 09:56.928
>> Nice to see you.

09:56.971 --> 09:57.762
>> I'm so glad you
could bring Bobo.

09:57.805 --> 09:58.805
>> Nice place
you got here.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.433
Lookie here!
Lucky girl.

10:01.475 --> 10:04.644
>> Princess Apricot is
so spoiled.

10:04.687 --> 10:07.480
Anybody that dates
our little girl

10:07.523 --> 10:10.150
gets the first degree
from her daddy.

10:10.192 --> 10:10.984
>> Yeah.

10:11.027 --> 10:13.028
>> Oh,
isn't that sweet.

10:13.070 --> 10:14.529
>> If you'll just
excuse me for

10:14.572 --> 10:15.822
a moment,
I'll be right back.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.907
>> Bobo.
Look at this dog.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.534
>> Oh, he's so excited.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.161
>> Look, this relationship
is not going to work

10:21.203 --> 10:22.495
if ya'll don't even look
at each other.

10:22.538 --> 10:23.413
[barking]

10:23.456 --> 10:24.664
Uh oh.
There's another dog.

10:24.707 --> 10:25.832
>> Ooh!

10:25.875 --> 10:26.499
[barking]

10:26.542 --> 10:27.500
>> Who is that dog?

10:27.543 --> 10:29.502
>> That's
Princess Apricot.

10:30.046 --> 10:36.134
[horror music]
[barking]

10:36.177 --> 10:37.260
>> Oh my goodness!

10:37.303 --> 10:38.803
>> Oh, boy.
Lookie here!

10:38.846 --> 10:40.388
We got another dog.

10:40.431 --> 10:41.890
>> Hey guys, look.
I'm not a, uhm...

10:41.932 --> 10:42.891
[barking]

10:42.933 --> 10:44.142
-biologist, but
I don't know if

10:44.185 --> 10:45.352
this is gonna work.

10:45.394 --> 10:46.686
The dog weighs
two hundred more

10:46.729 --> 10:48.605
pounds than this dog.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.857
>> Well, they've got step
ladders and chairs.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.484
>> Oh my gosh.

10:52.526 --> 10:53.568
>> Well, I'm sorry.

10:53.611 --> 10:54.819
You just wanna
talk about it,

10:54.862 --> 10:55.987
we'll talk about it.

10:56.030 --> 10:58.573
Bobo, here's your love
of your life.

10:58.616 --> 10:59.532
>> They like one another.

10:59.575 --> 11:00.909
>> I don't know if
that's like.

11:00.951 --> 11:02.827
>> Bobo does need
a strong woman

11:02.870 --> 11:04.204
to keep him in line.

11:04.246 --> 11:06.748
>> Bobo, you are way
out of your league, okay.

11:06.791 --> 11:08.667
That dog'll definitely
keep him in line.

11:08.709 --> 11:10.043
>> Do you love him?

11:10.086 --> 11:12.045
Do you really
love him? Huh?

11:12.088 --> 11:13.004
[barking]

11:13.047 --> 11:14.506
>> That doesn't
look positive.

11:14.548 --> 11:16.383
>> What little angels
they'll be.

11:16.425 --> 11:18.426
>> That dog may
eat this dog.

11:19.053 --> 11:20.136
>> Well, we can,
we can give something

11:20.179 --> 11:21.680
to settle her down.

11:21.722 --> 11:24.599
I mean, Im sure they
have pills for dogs.

11:24.642 --> 11:25.725
[barking]

11:25.768 --> 11:27.102
>> Princess Apricot
seems to like Bobo

11:27.144 --> 11:28.770
better than her last
boyfriend.

11:28.813 --> 11:29.771
>> Oh, well good.

11:29.814 --> 11:31.564
>> It was a really
bad break up.

11:31.607 --> 11:32.691
>> Yeah.

11:32.733 --> 11:34.693
>> Princess Apricot took
it really hard.

11:34.735 --> 11:37.153
>> Well, his last girlfriend,
at the end of the road,

11:37.196 --> 11:38.613
is a little Chihuahua.

11:38.656 --> 11:39.781
[sighs]

11:39.824 --> 11:41.700
And they just busted
up before I knew it.

11:41.742 --> 11:44.077
>> Princess Apricot
mourned for days.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.036
She wouldn't eat.

11:45.079 --> 11:46.121
>> Yeah.

11:46.163 --> 11:47.497
>> Oh, Bobo gets
right over 'em.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.040
He's just like
a Casanova.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.042
I don't know what to
say about him.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.712
Bobo and Princess Apricot
are getting along,

11:53.754 --> 11:55.213
but I just kind of
think this may be

11:55.256 --> 11:56.840
his last date.

11:56.882 --> 11:57.924
>> Thank goodness.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.551
>> Because she
had a boyfriend before

11:59.593 --> 12:01.428
and I think he
broke her heart

12:01.470 --> 12:03.805
and this little bully
can do it again.

12:03.848 --> 12:06.266
Now look, ya'll have
to take it slow

12:06.308 --> 12:08.560
so you gotta think
serious about that.

12:08.602 --> 12:11.146
>> Okay, well, I guess
we need to go.

12:11.188 --> 12:12.731
>> I just don't want it
to be uncomfortable,

12:12.773 --> 12:14.733
you know,
at church.

12:14.775 --> 12:17.444
You don't think it will
hurt her feelings.

12:17.486 --> 12:20.113
>> I don't even understand
the world you live in Kay.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.239
>> You know,
sometimes I wonder

12:21.282 --> 12:23.408
if he's really my son.

12:23.451 --> 12:24.492
But then I think,
he's just like his

12:24.535 --> 12:26.911
daddy so,
he is.

12:26.954 --> 12:28.455
>> Mom, I'll be in
the car.

12:28.497 --> 12:31.458
>> Princess Apricot
loves her new boyfriend.

12:31.500 --> 12:32.751
>> I think it might
be a little

12:32.793 --> 12:34.711
soon for
the 'L' word.

12:35.045 --> 12:38.882
[country music]

12:40.593 --> 12:42.010
>> Okay, Godwin,
we're gonna use

12:42.052 --> 12:43.553
this mighty bucker
here to kind

12:43.596 --> 12:45.430
of go over some of you
bull riding skills.

12:45.473 --> 12:46.473
>> It's been a while.

12:46.515 --> 12:47.849
>> Here's what
we're gonna do.

12:47.892 --> 12:48.391
[chuckles]

12:48.434 --> 12:49.476
>> Whoa!

12:49.518 --> 12:50.518
>> That's how you're
gonna get on.

12:50.561 --> 12:52.812
Ride bulls,
you drive them ol'

12:52.855 --> 12:53.938
hips forward and
when you hear that

12:53.981 --> 12:55.482
whistle, jump off into
your hand--

12:55.524 --> 12:59.027
>> And run like
the devil, Godwin.

12:59.069 --> 13:00.737
[laughter]

13:00.780 --> 13:01.738
[groaning]

13:01.781 --> 13:02.697
>> Come on!

13:02.740 --> 13:03.782
[grunting]

13:03.824 --> 13:05.158
>> All right, he's on.

13:05.201 --> 13:06.785
Ever since
I learned the fact

13:06.827 --> 13:08.870
Godwin used to
ride bulls,

13:08.913 --> 13:11.039
I've wondered what
that would look like.

13:11.081 --> 13:13.750
[shouting]

13:15.878 --> 13:18.505
And let me tell you,
I was not disappointed.

13:18.547 --> 13:22.008
You take a large,
human mass and put

13:22.051 --> 13:24.677
it on the equivalent
of a teeter totter

13:24.720 --> 13:26.930
and start gyrating...

13:29.725 --> 13:31.059
>> It's uncomfortable.

13:31.101 --> 13:33.061
I wanna look away,
but I can't.

13:33.103 --> 13:35.480
But you are powerless
to look away.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.482
>> Oh boy! Oh boy!
Oh boy!

13:37.525 --> 13:40.068
>> Because of
potential disaster.

13:40.110 --> 13:41.778
>> Okay Jase, you're
the calf roper.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.655
I want you to rope
him around the neck.

13:43.697 --> 13:45.573
Batter up, piece of
cake for you.

13:45.616 --> 13:46.616
>> It's all in the wrist.

13:46.659 --> 13:47.992
>> It's all in
the wrist, boy.

13:48.035 --> 13:49.702
>> See it going on him,
do it Jase.

13:49.745 --> 13:51.204
[grunting]

13:51.247 --> 13:54.290
[applause]

13:54.875 --> 13:57.043
>> Look, what Jase
lacks in talent--

13:57.086 --> 13:57.961
>> Yeah!

13:58.003 --> 13:59.462
>> The boy makes
up for it

13:59.505 --> 14:01.256
with just sheer
dumb luck.

14:01.298 --> 14:02.966
You are one lucky dude.
You know that?

14:03.008 --> 14:04.175
>> Lucky!?

14:04.218 --> 14:04.926
You know
what that's called?

14:04.969 --> 14:05.844
>> Blind luck.

14:05.886 --> 14:06.928
>> Talent.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.137
>> I've been around long
enough to know

14:08.180 --> 14:10.932
the difference between
luck and talent.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.183
>> You're just jealous.

14:12.226 --> 14:15.019
>> Naw. Me getting out of
Vietnam unscathed,

14:15.062 --> 14:16.145
that was luck.

14:16.188 --> 14:17.856
>> You roped him Jase,
but you know that

14:17.898 --> 14:20.608
in the rodeo, you've got
to be on a horse.

14:20.651 --> 14:21.317
>> Uh oh.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.360
>> Uh oh!

14:22.403 --> 14:23.820
>> My ability to
whoop anybody in

14:23.863 --> 14:26.155
a hand of poker,
that takes talent.

14:26.198 --> 14:27.782
>> You gotta do this
off a horse?

14:27.825 --> 14:29.325
>> A moving horse.

14:29.368 --> 14:31.369
>> Plus, a little cheating.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.413
>> Okay guys, it's
barrel racing time.

14:33.455 --> 14:35.415
A lot of rodeo fans
will say that

14:35.457 --> 14:37.166
barrel racing is
their favorite event.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.793
Jep, you know why?

14:38.836 --> 14:39.669
Because it's fast.

14:39.712 --> 14:40.461
>> Fast is key.
All right.

14:40.504 --> 14:41.421
[grumbling]

14:41.463 --> 14:42.505
>> Fast is key.

14:42.548 --> 14:43.590
>> You gotta race
against the clock.

14:43.632 --> 14:44.674
>> I want him
to go fast!

14:44.717 --> 14:47.510
>> Hey, mount up.
Let's do it to it.

14:47.553 --> 14:50.471
[bantering]

14:51.807 --> 14:54.017
>> Barrel racing is
all about speed

14:54.059 --> 14:55.685
and I fix to drive
this horse like

14:55.728 --> 14:57.312
a finely tuned racecar.

14:58.939 --> 15:01.941
Come on horsey.
We go this.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.903
>> Is it me, or is he
going really slow?

15:04.945 --> 15:06.112
>> Yeah, that's about
as slow as it gets.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.323
>> Hey, this isn't bad,
my first time.

15:08.365 --> 15:09.407
On second thought,

15:09.450 --> 15:11.618
racecars are
pretty dangerous.

15:11.660 --> 15:12.285
>> Hit the gas.

15:12.328 --> 15:13.494
>> Hit the gas!

15:13.537 --> 15:14.454
>> 'Kay, go!

15:14.496 --> 15:15.330
>> Uh oh.

15:15.372 --> 15:16.080
>> Not the brakes.

15:16.123 --> 15:17.206
>> Not the brakes!

15:17.249 --> 15:18.541
>> I'm going to treat
this horse

15:18.584 --> 15:20.543
like a finely
tuned Sedan.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.212
You are on big animal,
you scare me.

15:23.255 --> 15:25.340
A safe,
domestic sedan.

15:25.382 --> 15:26.049
>> Kick him,
kick him!

15:26.091 --> 15:26.883
>> Kick him!

15:26.926 --> 15:27.967
>> Kick him!

15:28.010 --> 15:28.509
>> I don't want
to kick him,

15:28.552 --> 15:29.802
he scares me.

15:29.845 --> 15:31.095
That way I get
to experience the joy

15:31.138 --> 15:34.474
of driving without any
unwanted head injuries.

15:34.516 --> 15:35.850
>> Whoo!
>> Good ride.

15:35.893 --> 15:36.851
[sighs]

15:36.894 --> 15:37.894
>> It's a little more
intimidating

15:37.937 --> 15:39.020
once you get
on there.

15:39.063 --> 15:40.355
>> Jep, I thought
that horse was gonna

15:40.397 --> 15:42.857
die of old age by
the time you got back.

15:42.900 --> 15:43.983
>> You didn't, you want
to try it?

15:44.026 --> 15:45.068
You wanna go fast?

15:45.110 --> 15:46.152
>> Well, I don't think
there's anything

15:46.195 --> 15:47.236
stopping us from
putting on a

15:47.279 --> 15:49.572
great rodeo
performance.

15:49.615 --> 15:50.406
Are you guys ready?

15:50.449 --> 15:51.240
>> I'm ready.
>> Yee haw!

15:51.283 --> 15:52.158
>> It's rodeo time.

15:52.201 --> 15:52.992
>> Let's go get
that steer.

15:53.035 --> 15:53.701

this is it.

we've got Martin,

16:24.108 --> 16:27.443

a little, old steer.

16:27.486 --> 16:28.194

we have Jase Robertson.

He's gonna be doing
a little calf roping.

Who knows,
if all goes well

17:05.232 --> 17:07.400
today I may just leave
the duck call

17:07.443 --> 17:09.652

All right, let me
try it again.

The training I did
on a practice

17:21.373 --> 17:22.498

not prepared

17:22.541 --> 17:24.459
me for
cattle roping.

17:24.501 --> 17:26.085
I wasn't
on a horse!

Any aspirations I had
of the cowboy life

anything that you

do that you're really,
really excellent at?

I shoot good.

shoot something.

that's a real gun, that was.

Where's the trigger on

may not pan out
as you hoped.

that you gave it a

21:07.808 --> 21:09.475
