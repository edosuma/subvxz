Does life mean anything?

13:32.579 --> 13:33.711
No. It's meaningless.

17:29.849 --> 17:32.016
most of my friends

but these guys
fucking stayed.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.155
First, there's John.

17:37.157 --> 17:38.756
Back in the day
when I was alive,

17:38.758 --> 17:40.158
John was a mod--

17:40.160 --> 17:42.927
in fact, he was called
John the Mod--

17:42.929 --> 17:45.396
but then he met
this Norwegian chick,

17:45.398 --> 17:49.267
and he moved to, like, Norway,
where he discovered black metal,

17:49.269 --> 17:53.838
possibly the most hardcore music
genre going on at the time.

17:53.840 --> 17:56.474
See, these Norwegian kids,
they were pissed off

17:56.476 --> 17:58.009
at Christianity for coming

17:58.011 --> 18:00.144
and fucking destroying
their culture.

18:00.146 --> 18:02.580
I mean, it happened, like,
10 billion years ago,

18:02.582 --> 18:04.715
but, you know, we all
need a cause, right?

18:04.717 --> 18:08.886
So John, being
Native American Mormon,

18:08.888 --> 18:11.856
kind of connected with this,

18:11.858 --> 18:14.459
so he changed his name
to Johnny Jekyll,

18:14.461 --> 18:15.893
buffed out, grew out his hair,

18:15.895 --> 18:17.695
started wearing
all this fucking makeup shit,

18:17.697 --> 18:19.664
drinking out of things
like this,

18:19.666 --> 18:21.699
and then he opened
a black metal shop

18:21.701 --> 18:24.102
here in Salt Lake City.

18:24.104 --> 18:28.139
Hey, uh, how much
for these smoke bombs?

18:28.141 --> 18:30.374
Uh, these--these--
these smoke bombs.

18:30.376 --> 18:31.776
How much
for the, uh--

18:31.778 --> 18:33.144
These are the Black Cat
smoke bombs,

18:33.146 --> 18:34.145
come 3 to a pack.

18:34.147 --> 18:35.580
How much?

18:35.582 --> 18:37.849
The--the Black Cat
smoke bombs,

18:37.851 --> 18:39.383
these, how much?

18:39.385 --> 18:41.953
It is illegal to sell smoke
bombs without a proper license.

18:41.955 --> 18:43.187
Well, no.
It's--

18:43.189 --> 18:45.490

19:38.878 --> 19:40.044

19:40.046 --> 19:41.212
why don't you just
put them away?

19:41.214 --> 19:43.147

19:43.149 --> 19:46.350

So then there's Sean.

19:51.257 --> 19:54.192
Now, Sean back in the day
used to sell acid,

19:54.194 --> 19:57.261
but after an accident where
he inadvertently ingested

19:57.263 --> 20:00.998
over 112 hits of acid,
he got so fucked up,

20:01.000 --> 20:03.167
he started thinking
that I was Jesus Christ,

20:03.169 --> 20:05.736
and, by the way, I like
to visit him sometimes

20:05.738 --> 20:07.471
in flashbacks
and freak him out.

20:07.473 --> 20:10.975
So Sean ended up begging,
but eventually,

20:10.977 --> 20:13.878
he got himself off the streets
and checked into a facility,

20:13.880 --> 20:15.846
and after a few years,
he got out

20:15.848 --> 20:18.616
and even got a job
working for a state senator,

20:18.618 --> 20:21.519
but, you know, you can't
really take the punk

20:21.521 --> 20:24.288
out of a guy like Sean.

20:26.425 --> 20:29.126
Man: When I search you,
what am I gonna find, huh?

20:29.128 --> 20:31.963
Look at me.
Needles?

20:31.965 --> 20:34.565
Maybe.
I don't know, man.

20:36.436 --> 20:37.668

20:37.670 --> 20:38.736

20:38.738 --> 20:39.737
What's up, man?

20:39.739 --> 20:40.738
What's up, dude?

20:40.740 --> 20:41.973

20:48.514 --> 20:49.847

to step back now.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.916

20:51.918 --> 20:54.118

20:59.993 --> 21:01.392

21:01.394 --> 21:03.794

you're arresting this man.

21:06.165 --> 21:09.500

22:02.055 --> 22:04.822
That's
a good question.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.924
What's a Punjabi
death match?

22:06.926 --> 22:09.126
Basically, it's like
a steel cage match,

22:09.128 --> 22:11.762
but you use bamboo
and stuff.

22:11.764 --> 22:14.031
Yeah, but who wins?

22:16.301 --> 22:17.835
Gunther.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.770
Oh, come on.
Gunther was a tool.

Oh, Gunther,
if we he in that--

22:25.378 --> 22:26.477
It was a catchy

22:26.479 --> 22:27.712
It was great,

22:28.981 --> 22:30.181
Did you know they each
got a million dollars?

22:30.183 --> 22:32.350
There was some point
where an assistant

22:32.352 --> 22:33.484
ran into the room
and told an executive,

22:33.486 --> 22:35.019
"Each Friend wants
a million dollars,

22:35.021 --> 22:36.420
or they're not doing
the show anymore."

22:36.422 --> 22:37.221
An episode.

22:37.223 --> 22:39.190
It's fucked up,
right?

22:39.192 --> 22:40.925
Not if Gunther is getting
a million dollars.

22:40.927 --> 22:42.226
Gunther didn't get
a million dollars.

22:42.228 --> 22:43.627
Then they shouldn't
fucking get anything.

22:43.629 --> 22:45.629
Hmm.

I think he should have
his own spin-off show.

See, now, way back
10,000 years ago

27:09.829 --> 27:12.162
when the whole thing started,
it was just punk,

27:12.164 --> 27:14.098
but over the years,
like religion,

27:14.100 --> 27:17.601
the whole thing began to divide,
so today it's hard to keep up

of punk there is.

taxidermist,

of pets around the house.

we had a swan--Edmund.

to know about his dad,

talk about his dad,

he could've
just asked me.

going to you?
