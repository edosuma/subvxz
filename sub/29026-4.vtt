10:01.493 --> 10:04.124
Now, Big Dick and Perry,
those two I saw a lot of.

10:04.124 --> 10:06.838
They both worked in the library,
I spend many hours in there.

10:06.838 --> 10:08.717
‐ Were they friendly?

10:08.717 --> 10:12.808
‐ Can't say,
but they had nothing in common.

10:12.808 --> 10:15.396
I suppose they both were misogynists,

10:15.396 --> 10:18.152
though in very, uh, different ways.

10:18.152 --> 10:19.446
Awful people.

10:20.532 --> 10:23.705
You know what it's like
when someone makes your skin crawl?

10:23.705 --> 10:26.334
‐ I sure do.

10:26.334 --> 10:29.466
Oh. Self‐awareness
was never your strong suit, was it?

10:29.466 --> 10:32.556

on charm and good looks.

10:32.556 --> 10:37.524

That may be a loose translation.

11:54.302 --> 11:55.805
But we get the news in here.

11:55.805 --> 11:58.268
Ya know, guy at Stanford,

11:58.268 --> 12:02.026
Guy at University of Wisconsin

that parole hearing was again?

12:19.185 --> 12:20.354
‐ I didn't.
VERONICA: Oh.

12:20.354 --> 12:23.611
That'll be easy enough to find out.
I'm gonna put it in my datebook.

12:23.611 --> 12:26.116
There's a lot of stuff
I'd like to tell the parole board.

12:26.116 --> 12:28.538
‐ Clyde Pickett... you say?

12:31.711 --> 12:32.921
VERONICA:
Mercer told me

12:32.921 --> 12:35.844
Clyde was Big Dick's protector,

12:35.844 --> 12:38.473
and it was kind of a joke
to the rest of the prisoners.

12:38.473 --> 12:42.148
Clyde was respected,
people didn't mess with him,

12:42.148 --> 12:45.362
but Clyde conned Big Dick,

12:45.362 --> 12:49.162
saw him as a future payday,
which seems to be coming true.

12:49.162 --> 12:53.588
‐ And Big Dick worked for Perry Walsh
in the library. That's interesting.

12:53.588 --> 12:56.844
‐ Perry's misogyny
fits with his manifesto.

12:56.844 --> 13:02.146
<i>Or</i> fits with someone writing a manifesto
to sound like Walsh.

13:02.146 --> 13:05.862
And who appears clever enough to do that?

13:05.862 --> 13:08.826
Your buddy Clyde.
‐ He's not my buddy.

13:08.826 --> 13:10.997
‐ What did you learn
down at the boardwalk?

13:10.997 --> 13:14.797
‐ Same sort of harassment happening
to Sul Ross has been going on everywhere.

13:14.797 --> 13:17.051
Just enough to imagine
it's a conspiracy.

13:17.051 --> 13:19.013
At the same time,

13:30.703 --> 13:32.289

the boardwalk businesses.

13:37.509 --> 13:39.638
‐ Well, that explains why
he was targeted.

13:39.638 --> 13:41.976

boardwalk real estate

13:44.313 --> 13:46.569

I'm in Southern California,

43:45.495 --> 43:48.376
but your boy... seems chill.

43:48.376 --> 43:50.631
‐ Bleaahh.

43:50.631 --> 43:53.512
Yeah.
‐ [ laughing ]

43:53.512 --> 43:55.892
‐ Uhh. All right, we're goin' in.
That's it.

43:55.892 --> 43:57.687
They better not be playin' Twister.

43:57.687 --> 43:59.190
‐ All right.

44:09.001 --> 44:10.922
I got the title. Here it is.

44:10.922 --> 44:12.967
‐ What is it?
‐ It's‐‐ It's‐‐ It's‐‐

44:12.967 --> 44:15.138
"It's" is the first word of the title.

44:15.138 --> 44:18.604
"It's Hard to Find Good Help:
the Clyde Pickett Story."

44:18.604 --> 44:20.190
‐ That is a good title.
‐ Right?

44:20.190 --> 44:24.281
‐ Case in point: we're doin' this job,

44:24.281 --> 44:27.371
a little savings & loan in Wallawa‐‐
whatever,

44:27.371 --> 44:29.709
Oregon, and, uh,

44:29.709 --> 44:33.509
I catch one of my boys
carryin' a <i>grenade.</i>

44:33.509 --> 44:36.389
‐ No! No!
CLYDE: Yeah! Yeah!

44:36.389 --> 44:40.272
And I say, "Kid, wh‐‐ why?!"
KEITH: "Why?"

44:40.272 --> 44:43.111
‐ And he‐‐ he says, "Just in case."

44:43.111 --> 44:45.115
‐ [ guffawing ]
‐ So at this point,

44:45.115 --> 44:47.160
I <i>know</i> I'm gonna end up in jail.

44:47.160 --> 44:49.916
KEITH: You're goin' down.
You're goin' down.

44:51.545 --> 44:52.505
‐ Mm. Mm.

44:52.505 --> 44:55.427
‐ Let me tell ya about a couple
of Darwin Award winners

44:55.427 --> 44:57.264

44:57.264 --> 44:59.978
[ laughter continues ]

44:59.978 --> 45:02.190
Number one daughter!

45:02.190 --> 45:03.944
‐ Dad. You remember‐‐

45:03.944 --> 45:05.071
‐ Leo!

45:05.071 --> 45:07.409
Leo! Oh...

45:07.409 --> 45:08.662
LEO:
Hey, Sheriff.

45:08.662 --> 45:11.960
KEITH: Oh, Leo was one of my deputies.
One of the good ones.

45:11.960 --> 45:14.298
‐ Now he works for the FBI.
LEO: Yeah.

45:14.298 --> 45:16.302
KEITH:
Good for you, Leo.

45:16.302 --> 45:17.429
Leo, Leo.

45:17.429 --> 45:21.437
Leo, this is Clyde Pickett.
Clyde Pickett.

45:21.437 --> 45:23.399
‐ Leo D'Amato, it's nice to meet you.

45:23.399 --> 45:25.863
‐ Yeah. Fed, huh?

45:25.863 --> 45:28.994
Is anybody in this town
<i>not</i> in law enforcement?

45:28.994 --> 45:32.543
‐ [ Keith laughs ]
CLYDE: You're here on business, I assume?

45:32.543 --> 45:34.589
‐ Yeah, still lookin' for Jimmy Hoffa.

45:35.716 --> 45:37.679
‐ So, boys, you just doin'
some day drinking?

45:37.679 --> 45:40.183
KEITH:
Whoa! Whoa whoa whoa whoa!

45:40.183 --> 45:42.187
[ hinges clanking ]

45:42.187 --> 45:43.774
‐ Here‐‐ No, I‐‐ I got it.

45:47.364 --> 45:50.705
Thanks.
I think that's my cue to hit the road.

45:50.705 --> 45:51.915
Thanks for the drink.

45:53.376 --> 45:55.088
KEITH: Ohh. Okay.

45:55.088 --> 45:57.552
Okay, let me know how it goes
with Ichiko.

45:58.386 --> 46:00.558
Yeah, lovely Ichiko.

46:00.558 --> 46:02.854
[ drunken laughter ]

46:07.029 --> 46:08.489
‐ Dad...
KEITH: Yeah.

46:08.489 --> 46:10.368
VERONICA: What the hell
is goin' on here?

46:10.368 --> 46:12.623
Two old booze hounds
deep in the giggle juice,

46:12.623 --> 46:13.625
bumpin' gums?

46:13.625 --> 46:15.003
‐ I was doin' my job.

46:15.003 --> 46:17.340
And what's with the fake‐aloo?
Our mark's no Jasper.

46:17.340 --> 46:19.344
‐ We tailed our meat
from the hardware store.

46:19.344 --> 46:22.059
Coulda been the same kind of nails
used as shrapnel in the bombs.

46:22.059 --> 46:23.352
‐ But you came up dusty.

46:23.352 --> 46:25.566
‐ I'm no bunny.
I knew it was a long shot.

46:26.484 --> 46:27.945
‐ Okay.

46:27.945 --> 46:30.450
I think I know
how you turned out like you did.

46:32.120 --> 46:33.957
Sheriff Mars...

46:33.957 --> 46:35.376
<i>always</i> a pleasure.

46:35.376 --> 46:36.797
‐ Back atcha, Leo.

46:36.797 --> 46:38.717
‐ Thanks for the company, Leo.
‐ Bye.

46:39.719 --> 46:40.721
‐ Hmm.

46:42.934 --> 46:45.773
‐ Are you still good
to hit the City Council meeting?

46:45.773 --> 46:48.111
‐ There isn't a bottle of rye
that can hold me down.

46:48.111 --> 46:49.948
‐ All the same, I think I'll drive.

46:49.948 --> 46:52.870
So, assuming Dick
is still the big cheese,

46:52.870 --> 46:54.039
what are we looking for tonight?

46:54.039 --> 46:56.586
‐ He's gonna want to turn the screws.
‐ Yep.

46:56.586 --> 46:58.757
BIG DICK: You see what happens
when we don't prune the vine.

46:58.757 --> 47:00.719
Violence and death.

47:00.719 --> 47:03.015
‐ [ crowd boos ]

47:03.015 --> 47:04.853
MAYOR DOBBINS:
I'm sorry, Mr. Casablancas.

47:04.853 --> 47:06.648
I may need a little help
with the metaphor.

47:06.648 --> 47:08.777
I don't think I'm the only one.

47:08.777 --> 47:09.779
BIG DICK:
It's simple, Mark.

47:09.779 --> 47:13.494
Old Neptune, clean, decent,
respectable Neptune,

47:13.494 --> 47:15.456
was the healthy fruit on tended vine.

47:15.456 --> 47:17.252
‐ And Neptune now...?

47:17.252 --> 47:20.049
‐ Rotten fruit... from an <i>un</i> tended vine.

47:20.049 --> 47:23.599
Violence is the unintended consequence
of letting a town go to seed.

47:23.599 --> 47:25.769
‐ What are we doing
about the <i>bombs?</i>

47:25.769 --> 47:27.690
ALL: Yeah!

47:27.690 --> 47:30.696
‐ I didn't find the analogy
at all hard to follow, Mr. Casablancas.

47:30.696 --> 47:31.907
‐ Thank you.

47:31.907 --> 47:36.081
‐ So you're saying this serial killer
that is terrorizing our town

47:36.081 --> 47:40.256
is doing so because of
a lack of one‐way streets on the boardwalk

47:40.256 --> 47:44.473
and neon signs taller than 12 feet?

47:44.473 --> 47:46.686
‐ [ crowd laughs ]
‐ Smirk if you want,

47:46.686 --> 47:49.567
but I predict that this will continue
if these measures are not passed.

47:49.567 --> 47:52.907
‐ Dobbins just got my vote
in the next mayoral election.

47:52.907 --> 47:54.451
‐ Veronica.

47:54.451 --> 47:56.080
Hey.
VERONICA: Max!

47:56.080 --> 47:58.501
Wow, hi! Long time.

47:58.501 --> 47:59.837
MAX: Yeah.
‐ How are you?

47:59.837 --> 48:03.052
‐ Screwed, actually,
if these measures get put into effect.

48:03.052 --> 48:05.599
‐ Okay, I've made my point.

48:05.599 --> 48:07.435
‐ [ applause and boos ]

48:07.435 --> 48:10.149
‐ Keep fiddlin' while Rome burns!

48:10.149 --> 48:12.780
‐ You own a business on the boardwalk.

48:12.780 --> 48:14.449
‐ How, High Are You.

48:14.449 --> 48:16.453
‐ Mm.
‐ I'm good. Name's Keith.

48:16.453 --> 48:17.623
How are you?
‐ No, no, Dad.

48:17.623 --> 48:21.130
He owns the dispensary
at Dickens and 3rd, How, High Are You.

48:21.130 --> 48:23.050
‐ Ahh. How's clever workin' out?

48:23.050 --> 48:25.013
‐ Right now not so good.

48:25.013 --> 48:28.352
And just when you thought it was safe
to sell recreational marijuana.

48:28.352 --> 48:30.481
‐ Well, good luck to ya.

48:30.481 --> 48:32.110
‐ Are you gonna get up there and speak?

48:32.110 --> 48:33.697
‐ You know, I spoke
to the other merchants,

48:33.697 --> 48:36.745
and it was collectively decided
that the weed dealer going up there

48:36.745 --> 48:40.001
wasn't putting our best foot forward,
so... yeah.

48:40.001 --> 48:41.755
‐ Hey, did you know Sul?

48:41.755 --> 48:44.969
PENN: [ clears throat ]
Hi, my name is Penn Epner.

48:44.969 --> 48:49.311
You gain some clarity
when you barely escape death.

48:49.311 --> 48:52.735
And you see people that you know
and care about die

48:52.735 --> 48:54.154
feet from you.

48:55.073 --> 48:57.327
I have a restless mind,

48:57.327 --> 49:03.214
and when I'm not earning a living
as a undervalued working class shmo

49:03.214 --> 49:06.971
in a town that doesn't want us around...
‐ [ shouts of ascent from crowd ]

49:06.971 --> 49:08.725
PENN: I've been
digging into this crime.

49:08.725 --> 49:11.271
‐ The focus here
is the Tidy Town measures.

49:11.271 --> 49:13.527
We were discussing the bombs earlier.

49:13.527 --> 49:15.488
‐ Right, well, let's get to it.

49:15.488 --> 49:17.535
Vote no on NUTT.

49:17.535 --> 49:19.664
DOBBINS: Okay‐‐
PENN: Vote no,

49:19.664 --> 49:21.751
because the people that are pushing
these regulations

49:21.751 --> 49:23.462
are trying to drive out the businesses

49:23.462 --> 49:26.678
that own the valuable
boardwalk real estate.

49:26.678 --> 49:28.974
They're responsible for the muggings!

49:28.974 --> 49:31.019
They're responsible
for the vandalism!

49:31.019 --> 49:34.151
And they're responsible
for the <i>bombings</i>

49:34.151 --> 49:38.910
that are killing Neptune
as a spring break destination city!

49:38.910 --> 49:40.329
‐ [ all yelling ]

49:40.329 --> 49:41.457
‐ [ pounds gavel ]
Security!

49:41.457 --> 49:42.960
Please remove the speaker.

49:45.799 --> 49:48.220
‐ What is happening?

49:48.220 --> 49:51.853
‐ Who exactly, do you ask?
Big Dick Casablancas,

49:51.853 --> 49:54.024
and his right‐hand man Clyde Pickett!

49:54.024 --> 49:55.819
‐ You little piece of shit!

49:55.819 --> 49:58.324
‐ [ all yelling ]
DOBBINS: All right, given the chaos,

49:58.324 --> 50:00.077
tonight's vote will be postponed.

50:00.077 --> 50:02.290
BIG DICK: No! The measures have the votes!
Mark, call the vote!

50:02.290 --> 50:04.002
You're gonna regret this!
Call the goddamn vote!

50:04.002 --> 50:05.463
‐ Meeting's adjourned.

50:05.463 --> 50:07.091
‐ You come here! Come here!

50:07.091 --> 50:09.137
‐ You see these people!

50:10.056 --> 50:12.520
‐ That cussing mothercusser. He‐‐

50:12.520 --> 50:15.358
‐ Bugged our office.
I believe you're right.
