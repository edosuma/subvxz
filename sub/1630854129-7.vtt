WEBVTT

00:03.699 --> 00:06.006
- What's all that?
- Adoption application.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.659
Fantastic!

00:07.659 --> 00:10.358
Your brother Leon turned up
in a CPD database.

00:10.358 --> 00:12.838
Leon <i>was</i> in a gang.

00:12.838 --> 00:14.144
But I got him out there.

00:14.144 --> 00:16.190
I'm going to give you back
your application.

00:16.190 --> 00:17.843
<i>We can't approve
adoptive parents</i>

00:17.843 --> 00:21.325
who might put Javi in close
contact with a gang member.

00:21.325 --> 00:22.587
Good hustle, Macy!

00:22.587 --> 00:24.328
I'm gonna apply
for the next CFD test.

00:24.328 --> 00:26.678
You're my first
official recruit.

00:26.678 --> 00:31.031
Girls on Fire makes girls
like me and Macy

00:31.031 --> 00:32.249
feel like becoming
a firefighter

00:32.249 --> 00:34.382
could really happen.

00:35.339 --> 00:37.080
I see you, Kylie.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.647
Get that foot behind the line.

00:38.647 --> 00:41.519
All right, first to
open up their nozzle,

00:41.519 --> 00:45.088
and knock our ballerina
off her throne, wins.

00:45.088 --> 00:47.873
Stay low, and keep
your weight forward.

00:47.873 --> 00:51.399
Ready, set, go.

00:51.399 --> 00:53.879
Go, Kylie!

00:53.879 --> 00:56.056
- All right.
- Yeah, let's go!

00:56.056 --> 00:58.058
Focus, focus. You got it.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.494
You got it.

00:59.494 --> 01:01.278
Look's like
Lieutenant Carr's course.

01:01.278 --> 01:02.888
- Ah.
- Minus the ball.

01:02.888 --> 01:04.194
Yeah, Macy set it up,

01:04.194 --> 01:07.502
so she must have gotten it
from his class.

01:07.502 --> 01:10.157
Jess is holding her hose
too high.

01:10.896 --> 01:12.985
Hold the hose tight
to your body, weight forward.

01:12.985 --> 01:14.291
That's it.

01:14.291 --> 01:16.685
Making my job easy.

01:16.685 --> 01:18.034
Thanks, babe.

01:18.034 --> 01:20.210
Good, good.

01:20.210 --> 01:22.343
Keep going.
- Whoo!

01:22.343 --> 01:23.953
Get up in there.
Get up in there.

01:23.953 --> 01:26.086
Oh, Kylie!

01:28.392 --> 01:30.829
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:30.829 --> 01:31.961
We have a winner!

01:36.270 --> 01:38.489
All right, everyone,
bring it in.

01:38.489 --> 01:40.578
Bring it in, bring it in,
bring it in, bring it in.

01:40.578 --> 01:42.624
All right, how do
we think she did?

01:42.624 --> 01:45.017
Because I think Macy's
ready to be the newest

01:45.017 --> 01:46.932
firefighter in the CFD.

01:50.153 --> 01:52.590
Listen, when I started
this program,

01:52.590 --> 01:55.550
I thought maybe someday
I'd see one of you

01:55.550 --> 01:57.247
go all the way
through the academy.

01:57.247 --> 02:01.295
And it is crazy that
that day is already here.

02:01.295 --> 02:04.602
Our first Girls on Fire grad.

02:04.602 --> 02:07.257
I'm so frickin' proud of you.

02:07.257 --> 02:09.477
All right, graduation.

02:09.477 --> 02:12.306
00 AM, Saturday,
at the Fire Academy.

02:12.306 --> 02:15.135
I expect to see every
single one of you there.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.745
All right?
- Uh-huh.

02:16.745 --> 02:18.268
Now get out of here before
you're late for homeroom.

02:18.268 --> 02:20.270
Go! Go! Go!

02:20.270 --> 02:22.751
Great job.

02:22.751 --> 02:26.276
Congratulations are in order
for you too, you know?

02:26.276 --> 02:30.324
This is a great achievement.

02:31.890 --> 02:33.240
Thank you, Chief.

02:42.858 --> 02:43.946
Ah!

02:43.946 --> 02:46.166
Cruz, I think it's done.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.819
Huh?
Oh, damn it.

02:47.819 --> 02:49.386
Oh, sorry.

02:49.386 --> 02:51.823
Hey, it's fine.

02:51.823 --> 02:53.173
No worries.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.565
It adds flavor.

02:58.439 --> 03:01.746
Everything OK, Joe?

03:01.746 --> 03:03.270
They put the adoption
application on hold.

03:03.270 --> 03:04.662
What?

03:04.662 --> 03:06.011
Why?

03:06.011 --> 03:08.100
Leon's name came up
in a gang database.

03:08.100 --> 03:09.537
But that's not right.

03:09.537 --> 03:10.929
He was working undercover.

03:10.929 --> 03:12.888
Yeah, I tried to
explain that in writing.

03:12.888 --> 03:14.281
I stepped out every detail.

03:14.281 --> 03:15.456
I even referred them
to Sergeant Voight,

03:15.456 --> 03:19.895
but ever since then, crickets.

03:23.072 --> 03:25.857
They'll call.

03:27.859 --> 03:30.035
<i>All units, multiple
vehicle accident.</i>

03:30.035 --> 03:34.039
<i>I-55 inbound, mile marker 82.</i>

03:55.800 --> 03:58.629
Hey!
Hey, get back!

04:01.023 --> 04:03.939
Squad, let's get airbags
underneath this I-beam truck.

04:03.939 --> 04:05.506
Get cribbing ready.

04:05.506 --> 04:07.247
Engine, cover us
with a hose line.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.857
Get extinguishers on that semi.

04:08.857 --> 04:10.206
Let's move.

04:10.206 --> 04:12.556
All right, Carver,
get the scene locked down!

04:12.556 --> 04:14.689
Mouch, Gallo, we're gonna
pull that car out

04:14.689 --> 04:16.647
as soon as it clears
squad's air bags.

04:16.647 --> 04:17.779
On it.

04:17.779 --> 04:19.084
Hey, you two OK?

04:19.084 --> 04:20.260
I think so.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.609
I had to lay my bike down.

04:21.609 --> 04:23.306
I went right under that thing.

04:23.306 --> 04:25.265
I'm good, but that guy's
in bad shape.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.701
We'll get him out of there.

04:26.701 --> 04:28.572
In the meantime,
let's have a look at you.

04:35.318 --> 04:36.406
Sir?

04:36.406 --> 04:38.452
Sir, can you hear me?

04:40.192 --> 04:41.933
- Hey, Kidd?
- Yeah?

04:41.933 --> 04:44.762
I'll get in there and
try and stop the bleeding.

04:44.762 --> 04:46.286
Copy.

04:51.029 --> 04:52.466
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:53.336 --> 04:54.816
There you go.

04:54.816 --> 04:56.600
There you are.

04:56.600 --> 04:57.949
Let's get you some more room.

05:01.475 --> 05:03.694
- OK.
- Oh, man.

05:03.694 --> 05:05.609
That's a load off.

05:05.609 --> 05:08.177
- Hey, what's your name?
- John.

05:08.177 --> 05:10.310
John?
Christopher.

05:17.839 --> 05:19.449
Hey, man, you got to
get behind the line.

05:19.449 --> 05:21.886
Yeah, OK.

05:21.886 --> 05:23.671
I said back up.

05:25.281 --> 05:27.239
You're playing around
with tape while there's

05:27.239 --> 05:29.459
people over there in danger.

05:29.459 --> 05:30.852
You're a real hero, huh?

05:30.852 --> 05:34.812
Get back.
I'm not asking you again.

05:34.812 --> 05:36.466
OK.

05:36.466 --> 05:39.208
Good.

05:39.208 --> 05:40.470
Yeah, nice and easy.

05:44.648 --> 05:45.910
Good for you
wearing a helmet,

05:45.910 --> 05:47.651
looks like you dodged
a concussion.

05:47.651 --> 05:50.437
Might want to get a
second opinion, buddy.

05:50.437 --> 05:51.916
Just saying.

05:51.916 --> 05:53.701
Keep moving, pal.

05:53.701 --> 05:55.790
- I'm behind the tape.
- Hey! Lieutenant!

05:55.790 --> 05:58.401
No!

05:58.401 --> 06:00.360
No, no, stop!

06:00.360 --> 06:03.014
Oh!

06:03.014 --> 06:04.320
Damn.

06:06.496 --> 06:08.368
Lost pressure!

06:09.281 --> 06:11.022
Herrmann, stay down!

06:21.598 --> 06:23.208
Herrmann,
you guys okay in there?

06:23.208 --> 06:25.472
Yeah!

06:25.472 --> 06:27.212
Where we at?

06:27.212 --> 06:28.953
The hoses are shot.

06:28.953 --> 06:30.433
We got replacements in
the truck, Lieutenant.

06:30.433 --> 06:31.565
No time.

06:33.654 --> 06:35.003
Let's grab two sets of jaws.

06:35.003 --> 06:36.657
We'll raise it that way.
- That'll work.

06:36.657 --> 06:38.180
- Yeah.
- Copy.

06:38.180 --> 06:40.574
Hermann, we lost pressure
in the air bag.

06:40.574 --> 06:42.924
We're gonna raise the I-beam
with the jaws.

06:42.924 --> 06:44.273
Copy.

06:44.273 --> 06:45.535
Hey, John?
- Yeah?

06:45.535 --> 06:46.710
Let's take a look
at this shoulder.

06:46.710 --> 06:49.409
OK.

06:49.409 --> 06:52.629
Oh, man, it's crazy the things
racing through my head

06:52.629 --> 06:54.414
right now.

06:54.414 --> 06:57.373
It's like they say, your whole
life passing before your eyes.

06:57.373 --> 06:59.984
Hey, John?

06:59.984 --> 07:01.856
We're going to get you
out of here.

07:01.856 --> 07:05.468
Keep going.

07:05.468 --> 07:07.209
That's it.

07:07.209 --> 07:10.604
Mouch, get the chain ready.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.740
All right.

07:16.740 --> 07:21.528
Ah, Katherine Harden,
now there's a memory.

07:24.008 --> 07:25.532
Easy.

07:25.532 --> 07:28.099
Hey, who is Katherine?

07:28.099 --> 07:30.754
- This girl I knew at Loyola.
- Yeah?

07:30.754 --> 07:33.148
I couldn't take
my eyes off her.

07:33.888 --> 07:35.716
Gather now.

07:35.716 --> 07:38.240
Easy, Gallo.

07:38.240 --> 07:40.590
That's it.
Keep it level.

07:44.768 --> 07:46.204
So what happened?

07:46.204 --> 07:49.991
We-we became friends.

07:49.991 --> 07:52.428
She's way out of my league,
I knew that.

07:52.428 --> 07:55.387
And I couldn't tell her
how I really felt because

07:55.387 --> 07:57.738
I was scared I'd lose her.

07:57.738 --> 08:00.567
I did anyway.

08:00.567 --> 08:03.526
She met another guy,
and they got married.

08:03.526 --> 08:05.615
Her life kept going.

08:05.615 --> 08:10.011
Haven't heard her voice
for 17 years.

08:13.971 --> 08:15.538
Let's get that cribbing
in there, Ritter.

08:15.538 --> 08:16.844
Yeah.

08:16.844 --> 08:18.672
How's that chain coming,
Mouch?

08:20.804 --> 08:22.197
Set!

08:22.197 --> 08:25.461
All right, Mouch,
get ready to pull them out.

08:25.461 --> 08:31.249
It's not a bad way to go out,
thinking of Katherine.

08:31.249 --> 08:33.469
Hey, like I told you, John,

08:33.469 --> 08:36.341
we're going to get you
out of here, so, okay?

08:36.341 --> 08:38.735
Hey.
<i>- Hey, Hermann, here we go.</i>

08:38.735 --> 08:40.345
<i>Grab him slow, Mouch.</i>

08:42.783 --> 08:44.262
That's it.

08:44.262 --> 08:46.743
Easy.

08:47.831 --> 08:49.267
Whoa!

08:52.836 --> 08:54.708
Okay, we're good!

08:54.708 --> 08:56.405
Okay, Gallo, you're on.

08:58.668 --> 09:01.279
Now, Carver, open it wide.

09:01.279 --> 09:02.672
You'll be fine.

09:02.672 --> 09:05.240
49 years old,
lost a lot of blood.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.589
Starting to look
a little shocky.

09:06.589 --> 09:09.026
- Copy. C collar.
- Here you go.

09:12.290 --> 09:14.075
All right. Easy.

09:17.252 --> 09:18.296
- I got his head.
- All right.

09:18.296 --> 09:20.037
One, two, three.

09:22.170 --> 09:23.214
Hey, you see?

09:23.214 --> 09:26.609
Hey, you made it out!

09:26.609 --> 09:28.611
No, radial pulse.

09:28.611 --> 09:30.613
His carotid is weak.
Must be crashing.

09:30.613 --> 09:31.658
OK, let's go.

09:37.707 --> 09:39.317
Nice bike.

09:39.317 --> 09:41.406
Gotta love a V-Twin, right?

09:41.406 --> 09:44.018
I'm going to miss it.

09:44.018 --> 09:45.933
It's not as bad as it looks.

09:45.933 --> 09:48.370
Some new pipes,
new cam cover.

09:48.370 --> 09:50.024
Back on the road in no time.

09:50.024 --> 09:51.373
Not me.

09:51.373 --> 09:53.157
I'm never getting back
on that thing.

09:53.157 --> 09:56.987
This was just a--
an expensive midlife crisis.

09:56.987 --> 09:58.119
Time for a minivan.

10:06.910 --> 10:08.346
BP 70 over 40.

10:08.346 --> 10:09.870
We got to move.
- All right, hang blood tubing.

10:09.870 --> 10:11.132
I'll call the Med and let them
know to have blood ready.

10:11.132 --> 10:13.787
Copy.

10:13.787 --> 10:15.832
You got to tell her.

10:15.832 --> 10:17.486
- What?
- Find her.

10:17.486 --> 10:20.228
- Who?
- Katherine Harden.

10:20.228 --> 10:21.664
John, come on.

10:21.664 --> 10:24.536
I need her to know
how much she meant to me.

10:24.536 --> 10:26.321
Please?

10:30.760 --> 10:32.936
OK.

10:32.936 --> 10:35.069
I'll tell her, OK?

11:02.139 --> 11:04.664
Gallo, sorry about that
rogue SUV back there.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.013
You good?

11:06.013 --> 11:07.797
Yeah, that bottle went
after you like a missile.

11:07.797 --> 11:11.540
Yeah, no sweat.
Nobody's fault. I'm good.

11:11.540 --> 11:13.716
I won't lose control of
the scene again, Lieutenant.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.239
That's a promise.

11:15.239 --> 11:17.633
What was the
distraction there?

11:17.633 --> 11:19.200
Was that guy
giving you trouble?

11:19.200 --> 11:21.419
Me, the medics,
guy just seemed to have

11:21.419 --> 11:22.769
a beef with first responders.

11:22.769 --> 11:24.335
Was he involved
in the accident?

11:24.335 --> 11:25.772
I don't think so.

11:25.772 --> 11:27.643
So he just
stopped by to offer

11:27.643 --> 11:29.993
his critique of our work?

11:29.993 --> 11:31.212
Huh.

11:31.212 --> 11:33.388
Weirdo of the week.

11:35.999 --> 11:37.131
Right.

11:37.131 --> 11:39.089
Hypothetically,
would you want to know

11:39.089 --> 11:42.484
if a friend from your past
were in love with you,

11:42.484 --> 11:44.529
even if you were married?

11:44.529 --> 11:45.966
Ooh, that's a fun one.

11:45.966 --> 11:49.360
And the friend,
which maybe dying.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.753
And not fun anymore.

11:50.753 --> 11:53.060
He could pull through.
It's possible.

11:53.060 --> 11:55.062
What kind of
hypothetical is this?

11:55.062 --> 11:56.541
I told John, our victim
from the pinnin',

11:56.541 --> 11:59.066
that I would track down
his long lost friend,

11:59.066 --> 12:01.285
and declare his love for her.

12:01.285 --> 12:03.766
But she's married,
and it seems--

12:03.766 --> 12:05.376
- Tricky?
- And also,

12:05.376 --> 12:08.205
he was in a bad way, and maybe
he wasn't thinking straight.

12:08.205 --> 12:11.252
You know, and maybe he's going
to get better, and realize

12:11.252 --> 12:13.515
that he doesn't want to get
in the middle of her life

12:13.515 --> 12:15.647
like that.

12:15.647 --> 12:17.824
Well...

12:17.824 --> 12:19.782
Hey, Brett?

12:19.782 --> 12:21.741
What's the latest on John?

12:21.741 --> 12:23.481
Did you get a chance
to check in on him?

12:23.481 --> 12:24.918
I did.

12:24.918 --> 12:26.789
Yeah, the doctors put him
on a ventilator in the ICU.

12:26.789 --> 12:28.225
They don't think he has long.

12:28.225 --> 12:30.662
Damn it.

12:30.662 --> 12:35.972
Hey, you said this woman that
he knew, they were friends?

12:35.972 --> 12:38.235
Yeah, from 20 years ago.

12:38.235 --> 12:40.542
But she'd still probably
want to know

12:40.542 --> 12:42.500
about his condition, right?

12:42.500 --> 12:44.024
I would if I was her.

12:44.024 --> 12:46.853
No matter how long it'd been. Yeah.

12:49.159 --> 12:51.466
Yeah.

12:51.466 --> 12:54.164
I'll try and track her down.

12:59.561 --> 13:02.738
Are you trying to rub a hole
through your equipment, Cruz?

13:02.738 --> 13:03.957
It's called cleanin', Cap.

13:03.957 --> 13:05.654
You should try it sometime.

13:08.613 --> 13:13.401
Hello?

13:13.401 --> 13:15.229
Robocallers.

13:15.229 --> 13:17.144
I swear, man, there's a special
place in hell for those guys.

13:17.144 --> 13:21.409
Cruz,
put it out of your mind.

13:30.331 --> 13:31.854
Is that the bike
from this morning?

13:31.854 --> 13:33.377
Whoa, Severide,
did you swoop in

13:33.377 --> 13:35.815
and buy it off that poor guy
in his moment of doubt?

13:35.815 --> 13:37.729
Ha, you think
I'm some kind of vulture?

13:37.729 --> 13:39.819
There she is.

13:45.694 --> 13:47.957
There we go.

13:53.441 --> 13:55.225
What's the matter?
- You bought a motorcycle?

13:55.225 --> 13:58.533
I told the guy,
why mess around with insurance,

13:58.533 --> 14:00.056
take a hit on your premium?

14:00.056 --> 14:03.407
Skip the headache,
and sell it to me.

14:03.407 --> 14:04.756
Got it for a song.

14:04.756 --> 14:06.149
Do you know how
to ride a bike?

14:06.149 --> 14:07.585
More importantly,
do you know how to fix one?

14:07.585 --> 14:10.501
Eh, I'll manage.

14:10.501 --> 14:13.026
Hoping to get some help from--

14:14.679 --> 14:16.899
Uh, why'd you have it
towed to the firehouse

14:16.899 --> 14:18.248
instead of your place?

14:18.248 --> 14:21.599
Because Trudy cannot
know about this.

14:21.599 --> 14:22.687
Understood?

14:22.687 --> 14:24.254
Not a word.

14:27.127 --> 14:28.780
Did you see
Mouch's new project?

14:28.780 --> 14:31.566
Ugh, yeah, he's getting
himself killed on that thing.

14:31.566 --> 14:33.785
If the bike
doesn't do it, Trudy will.

14:33.785 --> 14:36.919
Probably.

14:36.919 --> 14:40.357
Is that dude
watching the house?

14:40.357 --> 14:43.273
Gallo, I think that's the guy
from the highway incident,

14:43.273 --> 14:44.884
the one that was
messing with us.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.363
For real?

15:05.687 --> 15:06.818
All right, all right.

15:06.818 --> 15:09.952
One, two--wait, where's Lucy?

15:09.952 --> 15:12.302
I don't see her.

15:12.302 --> 15:13.521
Oh, there we go.

15:13.521 --> 15:15.653
All right.

15:15.653 --> 15:17.960
Wait, Lieutenant,
you got to be in this.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.832
Mom, can you take one for us?
- Sure.

15:20.832 --> 15:22.617
Thank you.

15:24.749 --> 15:25.968
- All right.
- OK.

15:25.968 --> 15:28.014
One, two, three.

15:30.059 --> 15:32.583
- Thank you.
- Look at this uniform.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.934
Like, damn girl!

15:34.934 --> 15:37.327
Lieutenant Kidd?

15:37.327 --> 15:38.285
Yes?

15:38.285 --> 15:40.765
Hi, you're Macy's mom, right?

15:40.765 --> 15:42.332
So good to meet you.

15:42.332 --> 15:44.682
Your daughter, she's amazing.

15:44.682 --> 15:46.206
She is.

15:46.206 --> 15:49.035
And she's everything to me.

15:49.035 --> 15:51.951
Do you have children?

15:51.951 --> 15:53.430
I don't, no.

15:53.430 --> 15:55.128
Then you might
not understand this,

15:55.128 --> 15:57.521
but I'ma say it anyway.

15:57.521 --> 16:00.524
These days,
every time I hear a siren,

16:00.524 --> 16:04.398
I think that is going to
be Macy risking her life.

16:04.398 --> 16:07.009
All because of a flyer
she saw in our neighborhood

16:07.009 --> 16:10.012
three years ago.

16:10.012 --> 16:13.973
A flyer you put there, right?

16:13.973 --> 16:15.496
Yes.

16:15.496 --> 16:16.932
Yes, ma'am.

16:16.932 --> 16:19.717
If anything happens to her,

16:19.717 --> 16:22.764
if I lose my daughter,

16:22.764 --> 16:25.375
just know that's on you.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.785
There are 19 different

16:43.785 --> 16:45.569
Katherine Hardens
in the United States.

16:45.569 --> 16:48.268
It is gonna take me days
to find the right one.

16:48.268 --> 16:50.096
You just googled the name?

16:50.096 --> 16:52.446
Yeah, that's what you're
supposed to do these days.

16:52.446 --> 16:55.101
It used to be
that you dial 411,

16:55.101 --> 16:56.972
or look in the White Pages.

16:56.972 --> 16:58.887
But now if you want to
try and find someone,

16:58.887 --> 17:02.369
you go to 15 websites, and they
try to sell you a phone number

17:02.369 --> 17:04.066
that might not even be theirs.

17:04.066 --> 17:05.807
- Found her.
- What?

17:05.807 --> 17:07.156
You're lying.
How?

17:07.156 --> 17:08.853
I searched her name
and a couple of keywords.

17:08.853 --> 17:10.942
Found a wedding notice,
checked that against LinkedIn,

17:10.942 --> 17:12.770
and there you go--
Katherine Harden,

17:12.770 --> 17:15.077
now Katherine Joyce,
graduated from Loyola--

17:15.077 --> 17:17.210
Loyola.
Yeah, that's what John said.

17:17.210 --> 17:18.602
That's got to be her.

17:18.602 --> 17:19.951
She's a high school
music teacher,

17:19.951 --> 17:21.518
and she lives right here
in Chicago.

17:21.518 --> 17:25.044
Herrmann, her Facebook page
says she's got a daughter,

17:25.044 --> 17:27.916
and she's divorced.

17:27.916 --> 17:29.657
Divorced?

17:29.657 --> 17:32.921
Ah, damn,
John didn't know that part.

17:32.921 --> 17:35.750
He probably would have
reached out if he had.

17:35.750 --> 17:39.319
Now you can do it for him.

17:39.319 --> 17:41.582
Hey, Severide,
quick question.

17:41.582 --> 17:43.323
Sorry, guys, motorcycle talk.

17:43.323 --> 17:45.281
When I pulled the pipes off,

17:45.281 --> 17:47.240
these little metal rings
fell out.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.589
Exhaust gaskets.

17:48.589 --> 17:50.460
Don't reuse them.
You got to buy new ones.

17:50.460 --> 17:52.245
Gotcha.

17:52.245 --> 17:55.117
And that bent fork, can that
be straightened, do you think?

17:55.117 --> 17:57.032
Or do I have to replace it?

17:57.032 --> 17:58.555
I thought you
said quick question?

17:58.555 --> 18:00.818
All right,
a few quick questions.

18:00.818 --> 18:04.605
Let me buy you a beer,
and pick your brain.

18:04.605 --> 18:08.261
Use that money
to buy a Haynes manual.

18:08.261 --> 18:10.001
A what?

18:10.001 --> 18:11.655
Then a car comes screeching
through the scene

18:11.655 --> 18:14.310
and goes over the hoses,
which makes the air bottle--

18:14.310 --> 18:16.834
pressurized at 4,500 PSI--

18:16.834 --> 18:18.967
come flying right at me
like a cruise missile.

18:18.967 --> 18:20.186
Dangerous.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.930
It could have put
a hole right through me.

18:28.194 --> 18:29.630
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:29.630 --> 18:32.154
I'm sorry I'm late,
post-graduation celebrations.

18:32.154 --> 18:33.590
No worries.

18:36.202 --> 18:37.855
How'd it go?

18:37.855 --> 18:40.031
Graduation was great.

18:43.209 --> 18:45.515
I met Macy's mom.

18:45.515 --> 18:47.126
She's not too happy with me.

18:47.126 --> 18:52.218
She says if anything happens
to Macy, I'm the one to blame.

18:52.218 --> 18:55.699
And that's just--that's got
me thinking about Kylie

18:55.699 --> 18:57.223
and all the other girls, and--

18:57.223 --> 18:59.964
We can't control
what happens on the job.

18:59.964 --> 19:02.663
That's why I'm so tough
on my cadets,

19:02.663 --> 19:04.708
so they're ready
when things get ugly.

19:04.708 --> 19:07.842
Yes, but your cadets
came to you.

19:07.842 --> 19:10.540
I recruited these girls
into Girls on Fire,

19:10.540 --> 19:12.977
and I did it to inspire
and empower them,

19:12.977 --> 19:15.241
but Macy's mom isn't wrong.

19:15.241 --> 19:17.504
I'm putting them on track
for a job where

19:17.504 --> 19:18.853
their lives are on the line.

19:18.853 --> 19:21.160
It's the best job
in the world.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.206
You've given them the ability
to be a part of it.

19:24.206 --> 19:27.862
You have inspired
and empowered them.

19:27.862 --> 19:29.951
The rest is out of your hands.

19:37.959 --> 19:41.702
Hey, try not to let anyone
die out there today.

19:41.702 --> 19:44.226
- What?
- You heard me.

19:44.226 --> 19:47.534
Hey.
Is that the guy, the heckler?

19:47.534 --> 19:49.057
- Yeah.
- Careful, miss.

19:49.057 --> 19:50.885
You could hurt a load
of incompetent firefighters

19:50.885 --> 19:52.495
that show up and make it worse.

19:52.495 --> 19:53.888
- Ignore him, ma'am.
- Hey, buddy,

19:53.888 --> 19:55.672
why don't you hit the road?

19:55.672 --> 19:59.241
There a problem here?

19:59.241 --> 20:03.593
This is a public sidewalk,
you can't kick me off it.

20:03.593 --> 20:06.030
No, sir, I cannot.

20:06.030 --> 20:07.902
But if you threaten
my firefighters

20:07.902 --> 20:12.298
or any of our neighbors,
that's a crime.

20:12.298 --> 20:13.951
I didn't threaten anybody.

20:22.656 --> 20:24.135
It's the same guy
from that call,

20:24.135 --> 20:27.008
and he was here last shift too.

20:27.008 --> 20:29.271
No idea what his problem is.
It's so strange.

20:29.271 --> 20:31.795
Well,

20:31.795 --> 20:35.625
hopefully that's the end of it.

20:40.543 --> 20:43.720
25% left in the tank, how
many minutes of air is that?

20:43.720 --> 20:46.114
Working five, at rest seven.

20:46.114 --> 20:47.637
Great.

20:47.637 --> 20:52.729
What is the collapse radius
for a five-story building?

20:52.729 --> 20:56.298
That's not in that
flash card deck.

20:56.298 --> 20:57.734
It's still important.

20:59.910 --> 21:03.305
- 60 feet?
- 90.

21:03.305 --> 21:05.829
Kylie, you gotta know
this stuff inside and out.

21:05.829 --> 21:10.878
And if you don't,

21:10.878 --> 21:15.448
you don't have to take
the exam in six months.

21:15.448 --> 21:18.015
Hold on, what?

21:18.015 --> 21:20.757
There's no rush.
You know?

21:20.757 --> 21:22.759
I'm confused.

21:22.759 --> 21:24.805
We always said I would
take it when I turned 21.

21:24.805 --> 21:27.590
I know, but maybe you
don't take it right away.

21:27.590 --> 21:29.331
You have so much time,

21:29.331 --> 21:31.725
and you could explore
all your options.

21:31.725 --> 21:33.640
My options?

21:33.640 --> 21:36.904
Wait, do you think
I'm not ready?

21:36.904 --> 21:40.821
I think there is no harm
in waiting,

21:40.821 --> 21:42.866
that's all.

21:45.565 --> 21:48.350
Just think about it.

22:10.111 --> 22:11.242
<i>Hi, this is Katherine.</i>

22:11.242 --> 22:12.592
Hi.

22:12.592 --> 22:14.333
Hi, Katherine, my name is--

22:14.333 --> 22:16.639
<i>I'm not available right now,
but please leave me a message,</i>

22:16.639 --> 22:17.858
<i>and I'll get right back
to you.</i>

22:17.858 --> 22:20.382
- Oh.
<i>- Thanks.</i>

22:21.644 --> 22:24.865
Katherine,
this is Christopher Herrmann,

22:24.865 --> 22:27.868
and I'm calling on behalf
of a friend of mine.

22:27.868 --> 22:30.740
Well, he's not
a friend exactly,

22:30.740 --> 22:33.874
but you knew him in college,

22:33.874 --> 22:36.398
and his name is John Millard.

22:36.398 --> 22:38.835
And he wanted me to
reach out to you,

22:38.835 --> 22:42.273
and tell you some things.

22:48.018 --> 22:49.933
Ah!

22:49.933 --> 22:53.415
Could they possibly make
this bolt harder to reach?

23:03.860 --> 23:06.167
Ah, got it.

23:06.167 --> 23:07.734
Nope, stripped it.
Son of a--

23:07.734 --> 23:08.909
Mouch!

23:08.909 --> 23:10.954
You're killing me, man.

23:10.954 --> 23:14.088
Here, get away from there.
Let me get it.

23:22.618 --> 23:25.142
<i>- Truck 81, ambo 61--</i>
- Be gentle with it.

23:25.142 --> 23:28.494
<i>Person in distress,
2800 South Sacramento Ave.</i>

23:47.208 --> 23:50.211
- What's wrong?
- I'm not sure, but...

23:57.000 --> 24:00.264
Yep, we got a problem.

24:17.499 --> 24:19.370
Permission
to brake check him?

24:19.370 --> 24:21.503
Negative.

24:21.503 --> 24:24.637
81 to Main,
we need police on scene.

24:24.637 --> 24:26.160
We have at individual interfering

24:26.160 --> 24:28.162
with our emergency response.

24:28.162 --> 24:30.469
<i>Copy that, 81.</i>

24:30.469 --> 24:32.166
It's like
he's getting bolder.

24:32.166 --> 24:34.342
Hey, do not engage.

24:34.342 --> 24:36.039
Let the cops handle it.

24:45.309 --> 24:46.963
Over here!

24:52.403 --> 24:54.797
Over here!

24:56.451 --> 24:57.626
Hey!

24:57.626 --> 24:59.846
I told him that
rail needed wax.

24:59.846 --> 25:02.283
Didn't listen.
- Oh, man.

25:02.283 --> 25:04.590
All right, hang in there.

25:06.592 --> 25:09.551
OK, Gallo, grab the grinder.

25:09.551 --> 25:10.596
- Copy.
- Get the stretcher.

25:10.596 --> 25:11.858
I'll pack the wound.
- Copy that.

25:11.858 --> 25:13.468
OK.

25:13.468 --> 25:15.992
Be ready to support the fence
when Gallo makes his cuts.

25:15.992 --> 25:17.080
All right.

25:21.432 --> 25:23.130
Sir?

25:23.130 --> 25:25.219
Sir, please stay back.

25:25.219 --> 25:27.134
Hey, you might want to get
your phone out and film this.

25:27.134 --> 25:30.224
Good to have evidence
if anything goes wrong.

25:30.224 --> 25:31.660
Why would anything go wrong?

25:31.660 --> 25:35.446
On account of incompetence,
that's why.

25:35.446 --> 25:38.754
Dude,
why are you saying that?

25:39.668 --> 25:41.409
Take it easy.

25:41.409 --> 25:44.107
Hey, shake a leg, man.

25:44.107 --> 25:47.589
Can't you see he's in pain?

25:47.589 --> 25:49.243
You're done here, pal. Leave.

25:49.243 --> 25:50.418
Carver!

25:50.418 --> 25:52.333
I got this, Lieutenant.

25:52.333 --> 25:54.378
This is a public park,
I have every right to be here.

25:54.378 --> 25:57.251
Keep moving.

25:57.251 --> 25:58.252
Don't touch me.

25:58.252 --> 26:00.471
Back it up.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.431
Yeah, they're here for you.

26:03.431 --> 26:04.867
Good,
I have plenty to tell them.

26:04.867 --> 26:07.043
Officer,
this fireman's threatening me.

26:07.043 --> 26:10.264
OK, come on over here
and tell me all about it.

26:10.264 --> 26:11.613
Why me?

26:11.613 --> 26:12.962
- Come on, let's go.
- I didn't do anything.

26:12.962 --> 26:14.747
- Let's go.
- He's the problem.

26:14.747 --> 26:15.922
- Forward.
- He's the problem.

26:15.922 --> 26:17.619
Forward.

26:28.543 --> 26:31.111
Herrmann, I was just at Med.
John's off the ventilator.

26:31.111 --> 26:32.547
He's doing a lot better.

26:32.547 --> 26:35.158
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh?

26:35.158 --> 26:37.508
I left Katherine
a long message.

26:37.508 --> 26:39.293
I'm talking cut off
by the beep long.

26:39.293 --> 26:42.644
I told her that he probably
wasn't going to make it.

26:42.644 --> 26:46.605
I went into the
whole rigmarole.

26:46.605 --> 26:50.304
I mean,
it is great news, of course,

26:50.304 --> 26:52.349
but what am I going to do now?

26:52.349 --> 26:54.047
Call her back and say, eh,

26:54.047 --> 26:57.659
never mind
everything I just said?

26:57.659 --> 26:59.487
- Yes?
- No.

26:59.487 --> 27:01.532
No, I knew I shouldn't
go messing

27:01.532 --> 27:04.579
in other people's lives.

27:04.579 --> 27:06.363
All right, I gotta--

27:06.363 --> 27:07.582
I gotta talk to John first.

27:07.582 --> 27:08.801
OK.

27:08.801 --> 27:10.237
I'm going to
give a call to Med,

27:10.237 --> 27:13.632
and see if I can swing by
after shift and see him.

27:22.728 --> 27:24.207
Hey, Lieutenant.

27:24.207 --> 27:25.252
Hey.

27:25.252 --> 27:26.514
You got a sec?

27:26.514 --> 27:28.864
Of course, yeah.

27:31.258 --> 27:33.086
What's up?

27:33.086 --> 27:35.175
If, uh--

27:35.175 --> 27:38.178
if I'm out of line,
just tell me,

27:38.178 --> 27:41.877
but I heard you
quizzing Kylie this morning,

27:41.877 --> 27:46.229
and it reminded me of when
I was fresh out of the academy.

27:46.229 --> 27:49.537
Have I told you much
about my parents?

27:49.537 --> 27:52.061
I don't think so, no.

27:57.240 --> 28:01.767
Well, they didn't want me
to go to the academy.

28:01.767 --> 28:03.725
They thought
I'd get myself hurt.

28:03.725 --> 28:06.423
I remember my mom saying,

28:06.423 --> 28:08.687
"Leave all that
to the real men."

28:10.689 --> 28:12.691
Seriously?

28:12.691 --> 28:14.083
Yeah.

28:17.739 --> 28:21.395
We had our issues,
to say the least.

28:21.395 --> 28:24.877
So I had to show them that
I could be as tough

28:24.877 --> 28:27.444
as my Uncle Anthony,
the firefighter.

28:27.444 --> 28:28.881
I studied hard.

28:28.881 --> 28:32.275
I worked my ass off in
the gym, and graduated.

28:34.843 --> 28:38.064
But their words,
they stuck,

28:38.064 --> 28:42.372
and the doubt kept creeping in.

28:42.372 --> 28:47.943
That's why Mouch found me
in that stairwell, frozen.

28:47.943 --> 28:53.644
And I just put that seed
of doubt in Kylie's mind.

28:54.863 --> 28:57.866
My uncle was my hero,

28:57.866 --> 29:03.393
and Kylie's hero is you.

29:03.393 --> 29:07.180
What you think means a lot.

29:11.967 --> 29:15.449
Hey, I hope your
parents know now

29:15.449 --> 29:19.322
you're a hell of a firefighter.

29:19.322 --> 29:20.715
Thanks to being here,

29:20.715 --> 29:24.197
I don't really worry about
what they think anymore.

29:24.197 --> 29:27.809
I know I am.

29:27.809 --> 29:30.246
Lieutenant.

29:32.814 --> 29:35.469
Thank you, Ritter.

29:35.469 --> 29:37.166
Yeah.

29:42.302 --> 29:44.217
Okay, that's it.

29:44.217 --> 29:46.610
Done.

29:46.610 --> 29:50.745
She's got new forks,
new pipes, gave her a tune up.

29:50.745 --> 29:52.834
She looks incredible.
Cherry, even.

29:52.834 --> 29:54.923
Oh, yeah.
Come on, let's hear that motor.

29:56.664 --> 29:58.013
Ah.

30:02.017 --> 30:04.628
Uh-oh.

30:04.628 --> 30:06.195
Everybody out of
the blast zone.

30:06.195 --> 30:08.371
It's cool, Mouch,
tell her it's my bike.

30:08.371 --> 30:10.809
The hell you will.

30:12.767 --> 30:14.813
What's going on here?

30:26.737 --> 30:29.044
The...

30:29.044 --> 30:33.005
I don't even know what
to say to you right now.

30:33.005 --> 30:36.399
You look like Marlon Brando!

30:42.884 --> 30:44.799
Hop on, baby.

30:48.759 --> 30:50.718
She's always been a hog fan.

30:50.718 --> 30:51.893
See you, boys!

30:51.893 --> 30:54.722
- Oh, okay.
- Whoo!

30:54.722 --> 30:56.550
Hey!

30:58.900 --> 31:00.684
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

31:07.822 --> 31:10.912
Hey, have you guys
seen Kylie?

31:10.912 --> 31:12.392
I think she just
went to the commissary,

31:12.392 --> 31:13.654
she should be back soon.

31:13.654 --> 31:16.396
Uh, hey, police called.

31:16.396 --> 31:20.269
They got the name of our
heckler, Edgar Weston.

31:20.269 --> 31:22.619
On a hunch, I checked the name
against our call logs,

31:22.619 --> 31:26.754
and it looks like
his father died

31:26.754 --> 31:30.758
at that wedding fire that
we responded to a while back.

31:30.758 --> 31:32.412
The tent fire.

31:32.412 --> 31:34.022
The guy that Mouch and me
pulled out?

31:34.022 --> 31:35.371
Yeah, I remember him.

31:35.371 --> 31:37.373
He had some of the worst burns
I've ever seen.

31:37.373 --> 31:39.288
So this Edgar isn't
just some random crazy.

31:39.288 --> 31:41.116
He's coming after us
because he blames us

31:41.116 --> 31:44.076
for his father's death.

31:51.083 --> 31:52.780
This man, his son,

31:52.780 --> 31:54.608
he's obviously
going through something

31:54.608 --> 31:56.262
that is driven by that loss.

31:56.262 --> 31:57.654
Cops arrest him?

31:57.654 --> 31:59.830
No, he hasn't done
anything illegal.

31:59.830 --> 32:01.136
Yet.

32:01.136 --> 32:04.444
So if he shows up again,
we keep our distance,

32:04.444 --> 32:05.619
let the police handle it.

32:05.619 --> 32:07.447
You got it chief.

32:07.447 --> 32:09.014
Yes, sir.

32:11.973 --> 32:13.975
Be safe.

32:22.897 --> 32:25.900
Hey.

32:25.900 --> 32:27.858
You don't--you don't
have to do that.

32:27.858 --> 32:30.122
Hey.

32:30.122 --> 32:32.515
It is no problem.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.651
I owe you an apology.

32:37.651 --> 32:40.001
You are more than ready
for that entrance exam.

32:40.001 --> 32:42.308
If you could take it tomorrow,
I'd tell you to do it.

32:42.308 --> 32:43.613
But you said that--

32:43.613 --> 32:46.573
I was doing a lot
of overthinking.

32:46.573 --> 32:48.314
You may have noticed
it's a small problem I have.

32:48.314 --> 32:51.012
No way.

32:51.012 --> 32:52.840
Listen, just know this.

32:52.840 --> 32:56.061
The more I care,
the more I overthink.

33:12.729 --> 33:14.818
Chief?

33:17.517 --> 33:19.171
OK, heads up, people.

33:19.171 --> 33:22.043
Ritter, radio CPD.

33:22.043 --> 33:23.566
Yep.

33:23.566 --> 33:25.481
You think you could sic
the cops on me, scare me off?

33:25.481 --> 33:26.526
I have rights.

33:26.526 --> 33:28.136
Hey, hey, back it up. Hey.

33:28.136 --> 33:31.183
You wanna get physical,
you will end up in jail.

33:31.183 --> 33:33.794
Now calm down, Edgar.

33:42.020 --> 33:45.893
He's gone!

33:45.893 --> 33:48.548
And you just go about your
lives like nothing happened,

33:48.548 --> 33:52.204
like you had nothing
to do with it!

33:52.204 --> 33:55.729
OK, everyone.

33:55.729 --> 33:58.601
Everyone go inside now. Go.

33:58.601 --> 33:59.733
- Violet, what are you--
- You think you're the only

33:59.733 --> 34:01.561
person who lost someone?
- Violet--

34:01.561 --> 34:05.782
The only person who has had
someone ripped away from them?

34:05.782 --> 34:07.915
It is a living hell,
and I know it.

34:07.915 --> 34:10.178
Feels like
you're drowning because

34:10.178 --> 34:13.703
every day since he died, you
haven't been able to breathe.

34:13.703 --> 34:17.925
It doesn't make any sense,
but every day you wake up,

34:17.925 --> 34:21.755
and you realize that
he's still not there, right?

34:26.281 --> 34:29.023
It was an accident,

34:29.023 --> 34:31.765
a tragic accident.

34:31.765 --> 34:33.506
And looking
for someone to blame

34:33.506 --> 34:36.422
isn't going to make
the pain go away, Edgar.

34:41.296 --> 34:46.040
It would have been their
40th anniversary last week.

34:46.040 --> 34:50.131
My mom won't get out of bed.

34:55.267 --> 34:58.792
It's ruined us.

34:58.792 --> 35:01.273
I'm sorry.
I am.

35:01.273 --> 35:04.928
That's awful.

35:06.843 --> 35:09.977
I don't know how
to make it better.

35:11.674 --> 35:15.113
You can't.

35:15.113 --> 35:17.202
I think...

35:17.202 --> 35:20.683
maybe only time can do that.

35:49.799 --> 35:52.193
I was just real relieved

35:52.193 --> 35:53.934
when I heard that
you were doing better.

35:53.934 --> 35:57.155
Like you said,
you'd get me out,

35:57.155 --> 35:59.200
and you did.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.202
I also told you that

36:01.202 --> 36:04.510
I'd track your friend
Katherine down,

36:04.510 --> 36:07.904
and I did that, too.

36:07.904 --> 36:08.992
What?

36:08.992 --> 36:10.690
Yeah, she lives
here in Chicago.

36:10.690 --> 36:11.865
Oh, God.

36:11.865 --> 36:13.736
I wasn't thinking straight.

36:13.736 --> 36:15.738
- Oh, I knew it!
- Well, no, no.

36:15.738 --> 36:18.001
It's just, she's married,
and I really--

36:18.001 --> 36:20.700
Actually, she's divorced.

36:20.700 --> 36:22.484
God, OK.
So that'll make it even worse.

36:22.484 --> 36:23.703
Now she's going to think I'm--

36:23.703 --> 36:25.226
I'm some kind of creep

36:25.226 --> 36:27.054
that's going
to be taking advantage of her.

36:27.054 --> 36:28.534
That is not--
- John, let me--

36:28.534 --> 36:30.710
let me say this.

36:30.710 --> 36:32.755
Shake off those nerves.

36:32.755 --> 36:35.236
See, if you're lucky enough
to have the chance

36:35.236 --> 36:39.806
to be with someone
that you really care about,

36:39.806 --> 36:41.329
you gotta go for it.

36:41.329 --> 36:44.071
'Cause you never know

36:44.071 --> 36:47.770
when that chance will just...

36:47.770 --> 36:51.513
disappear, right?

36:51.513 --> 36:53.211
She's here.

36:54.821 --> 36:57.824
And she looks the same.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.220
John?

37:02.220 --> 37:04.222
Hey, Katie.

37:04.222 --> 37:05.962
What happened?
Are you all right?

37:05.962 --> 37:10.053
Yeah, I'll be fine,
just scratched up.

37:10.053 --> 37:11.577
Hey,
I'm Christopher Herrmann.

37:11.577 --> 37:13.535
Hey, please.
- Thanks.

37:13.535 --> 37:17.147
Uh, I'm the guy that left
a very long message.

37:17.147 --> 37:21.108
My heart stopped when you
said John was in the hospital.

37:21.108 --> 37:23.023
I hadn't heard your name
in so many years,

37:23.023 --> 37:24.894
but as soon as I did,
all I could think was

37:24.894 --> 37:27.157
"Play the Spice Girls!"

37:27.157 --> 37:28.637
- But you never would.
- No.

37:30.944 --> 37:36.166
Hey, you guys,
I gotta go, but, um,

37:36.166 --> 37:38.081
it was really good
to meet you, Katherine.

37:38.081 --> 37:40.606
Same.

37:40.606 --> 37:42.216
Thanks, Lieutenant.

37:53.575 --> 37:57.318
So this guy's
yelling at us,

37:57.318 --> 38:00.974
and all I'm thinking is,

38:00.974 --> 38:03.411
it's just like Macy's mom.

38:03.411 --> 38:05.065
Like all of us, really.

38:05.065 --> 38:06.675
If there's someone to blame,

38:06.675 --> 38:09.374
you can be angry
instead of sad.

38:09.374 --> 38:12.115
Angry is easier.

38:14.640 --> 38:16.032
Lieutenant Morgan?

38:16.032 --> 38:18.165
Two big shot lieutenants
visiting my firehouse

38:18.165 --> 38:19.819
at the same time?

38:19.819 --> 38:21.299
- How's it going, Morgan?
- Hey.

38:21.299 --> 38:24.476
Pretty damn good.
To what do I owe this pleasure?

38:24.476 --> 38:26.304
Hey.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.349
You got a new
firefighter joining next shift.

38:28.349 --> 38:31.613
Macy Vasquez.

38:31.613 --> 38:33.789
Will you keep an eye
on her for me?

38:33.789 --> 38:36.183
She's one of my girls.

38:36.183 --> 38:38.794
You bet.

38:41.884 --> 38:44.147
So what's the occasion?

38:44.147 --> 38:46.367
It doesn't look like
you need seat fillers.

38:46.367 --> 38:48.108
No.
No occasion.

38:48.108 --> 38:51.503
I just wanted to spend
some time with my girl.

38:51.503 --> 38:53.679
You know,

38:53.679 --> 38:55.724
I've been thinking about
the first time

38:55.724 --> 38:57.378
that I asked you out.

38:57.378 --> 38:59.815
I never told you this,

38:59.815 --> 39:04.254
but I almost didn't do it.

39:04.254 --> 39:09.216
You were outside the cafeteria
looking through your backpack,

39:09.216 --> 39:11.697
and I started walking
towards you,

39:11.697 --> 39:14.787
and I just froze.

39:14.787 --> 39:17.311
I lost all my nerve.
- Yeah?

39:17.311 --> 39:19.400
Yeah.

39:19.400 --> 39:23.361
Then I yelled at myself
for a minute, and I said,

39:23.361 --> 39:25.624
what, are you crazy?

39:25.624 --> 39:28.931
Get your ass over there

39:28.931 --> 39:31.456
and talk to her.

39:31.456 --> 39:33.545
Thank God I did.

39:33.545 --> 39:37.679
Because asking you out...

39:37.679 --> 39:40.116
was the best decision
of my life.

39:45.948 --> 39:49.256
You're damn right it was.

39:49.256 --> 39:51.693
So the next round better
have top-shelf tequila.

39:51.693 --> 39:53.782
Oh.

39:55.436 --> 39:56.959
What you said
made a difference to him, Vi.

39:56.959 --> 39:58.700
That was brave.

39:58.700 --> 39:59.745
Yeah, I feel for him,
seems like

39:59.745 --> 40:01.747
he's going through it alone.

40:01.747 --> 40:04.750
Meanwhile, I have
my whole 51 family

40:04.750 --> 40:07.448
to keep me in one piece.

40:10.277 --> 40:11.365
It's her.

40:11.365 --> 40:13.454
It's her!
It's her, guys, it's her.

40:13.454 --> 40:16.892
Um...

40:18.590 --> 40:22.376
This is Joe.

40:22.376 --> 40:26.380
Uh-huh.

40:26.380 --> 40:27.599
Mm-hmm.

40:27.599 --> 40:29.644
Yeah.

40:29.644 --> 40:32.299
Yeah, I understand.

40:32.299 --> 40:34.214
Thank you.

40:37.609 --> 40:39.480
The adoption's going through.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.047
Ah.

40:43.179 --> 40:46.444
Javi's gonna be my son.
- Let's go!

40:49.447 --> 40:50.970
Congratulations.
