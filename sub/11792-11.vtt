00:48.515 --> 00:49.882
[laughter]

00:49.949 --> 00:53.118
the albert poland award. Do

00:53.186 --> 00:54.219
You know how many doctors have

00:54.287 --> 00:55.454
Won that thing, and then,

00:55.522 --> 00:56.555
They've gone on to win

00:56.623 --> 00:57.389
The nobel?

00:57.457 --> 00:58.390
well, that's what I'm talking

00:58.458 --> 01:00.526
About. We are back in black,

01:00.593 --> 01:02.694
Buddy boy. Nobody we care about

01:02.762 --> 01:04.830
Is dying and/or incarcerated,

01:04.897 --> 01:05.864
Right? We're about to head back

01:05.932 --> 01:07.833
To our alma mater and rub their

01:07.901 --> 01:09.034
Snotty little noses in it. I'm

01:09.102 --> 01:09.701
Very excited.

01:09.769 --> 01:11.370
oh, come on. It's not that

01:11.437 --> 01:12.404
Big a deal.

01:12.472 --> 01:14.173
oh. Excuse me. Ok. Lizzie?

01:14.240 --> 01:14.840
yeah?

01:14.908 --> 01:15.574
would you just read this to

01:15.642 --> 01:17.309
Him, ok? Mr. Humble pie over

01:17.377 --> 01:18.076
There?

01:18.144 --> 01:18.977
I certainly shall.

01:19.045 --> 01:19.711
ok.

01:19.779 --> 01:22.748
hmm. "dear. Dr. Mcnamara and

01:22.815 --> 01:25.817
Dr. Troy, for 40 years,

01:25.885 --> 01:28.320
The university of miami has been

01:28.388 --> 01:30.155
Bestowing the albert poland

01:30.223 --> 01:32.024
Award to those physicians who

01:32.091 --> 01:33.592
Have made significant

01:33.660 --> 01:35.794
Contributions to their medical

01:35.862 --> 01:37.362
Profession in their chosen

01:37.430 --> 01:38.197
Fields."

01:38.264 --> 01:39.064
significant contributions.

01:39.132 --> 01:40.599
yes. Yes.

01:40.667 --> 01:41.333
but isn't it kind of

01:41.401 --> 01:42.968
A lifetime achievement award?

01:43.036 --> 01:44.503
I'm 45. These things are

01:44.571 --> 01:45.304
Supposed to happen when

01:45.371 --> 01:46.004
You're 80.

01:46.072 --> 01:46.772
what's the matter with this

01:46.839 --> 01:47.639
Guy? Ever since we met, he's had

01:47.707 --> 01:48.874
This dark cloud just hovering

01:48.942 --> 01:49.608
Over him.

01:49.676 --> 01:51.510
well, the cloud was called

01:51.578 --> 01:53.478
Reality. We were pre-med

01:53.546 --> 01:54.846
Students. It was non-stop

01:54.914 --> 01:56.114
Pressure and misery. And you

01:56.182 --> 01:57.549
Spent your days just whistling

01:57.617 --> 01:58.917
Past the graveyard.

01:58.985 --> 02:03.522
want a bite?

02:03.590 --> 02:07.459
Sean mcnamara, right?

02:07.527 --> 02:11.330
Christian troy.

02:11.397 --> 02:12.364
I'm pre-med, too. We're in all

02:12.432 --> 02:13.865
The same classes.

02:13.933 --> 02:15.067
I don't remember seeing you.

02:15.134 --> 02:16.201
oh, yeah. I have attendance

02:16.269 --> 02:18.470
Issues. But that is going to

02:18.538 --> 02:21.106
Change. Sophomore year, and I'm

02:21.174 --> 02:23.175
Turning over a new leaf. And

02:23.243 --> 02:25.544
With that in mind, my roommate

02:25.612 --> 02:26.545
Just had a breakdown or

02:26.613 --> 02:27.713
Something, and I've got an extra

02:27.780 --> 02:31.183
Bed. You want to bunk together?

02:31.251 --> 02:32.284
I mean, I figured, since we're

02:32.352 --> 02:34.286
In the same classes, we can cram

02:34.354 --> 02:35.887
For exams, help each other out

02:35.955 --> 02:38.624
With labs.

02:38.691 --> 02:39.524
and I suppose the fact that

02:39.592 --> 02:41.226
I'm number one in our class has

02:41.294 --> 02:43.562
Nothing to do with your request.

02:43.630 --> 02:44.930
of course not.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.732
what number are you?

02:46.799 --> 02:49.368
42, with a bullet.

02:49.435 --> 02:50.836
solidly in the middle.

02:50.903 --> 02:53.705
oh, sure, now I am. This is

02:53.773 --> 02:56.575
Just school. It's bullshit. I am

02:56.643 --> 02:58.543
The only guy here who has seen

02:58.611 --> 03:02.814
The future of medicine.

03:02.882 --> 03:05.083
Don't you get it? This is

03:05.151 --> 03:07.386
The new ideal--barbie dolls,

03:07.453 --> 03:09.488
Plasticized, flawless women, and

03:09.555 --> 03:11.123
It is catching on with men, too.

03:11.190 --> 03:12.057
plastic surgery.

03:12.125 --> 03:12.891
the way of the future.

03:12.959 --> 03:13.692
yeah. It sounds like

03:13.760 --> 03:14.493
Meaningful work.

03:14.560 --> 03:15.193
oh, what, slaving away for

03:15.261 --> 03:16.361
Some insurance company for

03:16.429 --> 03:17.396
Pennies while you grab some old

03:17.463 --> 03:18.897
Guy's balls and say "cough" is

03:18.965 --> 03:19.564
Your dream?

03:19.632 --> 03:22.100
no, but saving lives is.

03:22.168 --> 03:23.368
Making a difference with my

03:23.436 --> 03:24.469
Work. You might want to consider

03:24.537 --> 03:25.737
A different major.

03:25.805 --> 03:27.572
and what would you suggest?

03:27.640 --> 03:29.141
do they offer courses in used

03:29.208 --> 03:31.443
Car sales?

03:31.511 --> 03:33.545
[both laughing]

03:33.613 --> 03:34.513
how did I get him to room

03:34.580 --> 03:35.847
With me? I blew him!

03:35.915 --> 03:38.884
[all laughing]

03:38.951 --> 03:40.752
seriously, you know me. I

03:40.820 --> 03:41.887
Didn't take no for an answer,

03:41.954 --> 03:42.587
Eh?

03:42.655 --> 03:43.288
you know what? He harassed

03:43.356 --> 03:45.123
Me. Eventually, I agreed just to

03:45.191 --> 03:46.158
Shut him up.

03:46.225 --> 03:48.460
[all laugh]

03:48.528 --> 03:50.595
and the rest--the rest is

03:50.663 --> 03:51.963
History, right?

03:52.031 --> 03:52.798
mm-hmm.

03:52.865 --> 03:53.632
mmm.

03:53.700 --> 03:57.069
look at this.

03:57.136 --> 03:58.503
to another 25.

03:58.571 --> 03:59.404
hear, hear.

03:59.472 --> 04:00.505
hear, hear.

04:00.573 --> 04:02.441
[applause]

04:02.508 --> 04:14.820

About yourself, mr. Daly.

04:57.488 --> 04:58.588

04:58.656 --> 05:00.023
dan.

05:00.091 --> 05:00.957
[grunts]

05:01.025 --> 05:01.658
he didn't mean to be

05:01.726 --> 05:02.559
Condescending. It's just--

05:02.627 --> 05:03.894
[chuckles] our way of--

05:03.961 --> 05:06.429
you too, shitface. Uh-oh.

05:06.497 --> 05:08.431
Sorry. You can't say that to

05:08.499 --> 05:10.167
The doctors.

05:10.234 --> 05:12.636
the insults are just his way

05:12.703 --> 05:15.038
Of showing his admiration. It's

05:15.106 --> 05:15.806
Part of the condition I

05:15.873 --> 05:16.807
Mentioned on the phone.

05:16.874 --> 05:19.242
oh, yeah. Uh, lesch-nyhan

05:19.310 --> 05:19.910
Syndrome.

05:19.977 --> 05:21.545
had you heard of it before?

05:21.612 --> 05:23.113
no. We did some research.

05:23.181 --> 05:24.447
A rare genetic disorder

05:24.515 --> 05:25.782
Characterized by an excess of

05:25.850 --> 05:27.317
Uric acid in the blood.

05:27.385 --> 05:28.051
affecting the area of

05:28.119 --> 05:29.853
The brain that governs impulse

05:29.921 --> 05:30.720
Control.

05:30.788 --> 05:32.289
ade from the muscle spasms,

05:32.356 --> 05:33.790
The effects can often turn

05:33.858 --> 05:37.027
Emotions into opposing impulses.

05:37.094 --> 05:39.996
Love is hate, elation can become

05:40.064 --> 05:42.165
Misery, and admiration comes out

05:42.233 --> 05:43.033
As...

05:43.100 --> 05:44.434
"go to hell."

05:44.502 --> 05:46.169
in that case, we understand,

05:46.237 --> 05:47.270
And it's a pleasure to meet you

05:47.338 --> 05:48.538
Too, mr. Daly.

05:48.606 --> 05:52.943
can I see that...

05:53.010 --> 05:55.245
Thing on your desk?

05:55.313 --> 05:56.580
you mean this?

05:56.647 --> 05:59.082
I want it. I really want it.

05:59.150 --> 06:00.750
sure. You can have it--

06:00.818 --> 06:03.086
[grunts]

06:03.154 --> 06:05.755
I should have warned you--

06:05.823 --> 06:07.791
Self-mutilation is a primary

06:07.859 --> 06:10.126
Manifestation of the disorder.

06:10.194 --> 06:11.394
You probably noticed that with

06:11.462 --> 06:14.431
His lips already. He chewed them

06:14.498 --> 06:15.131
Off.

06:15.199 --> 06:17.968
asshole. Oh, no. [grunts]

06:18.035 --> 06:19.870
it's why having a full-time

06:19.937 --> 06:21.104
Person to watch over him is

06:21.172 --> 06:25.075
Essential...Which is not without

06:25.142 --> 06:27.477
Its risks.

06:27.545 --> 06:30.847
I--I don't want to hurt him,

06:30.915 --> 06:35.886
But I--I can't stop myself, even

06:35.953 --> 06:40.123
When I try. It's just like with

06:40.191 --> 06:41.858
My hands.

06:41.926 --> 06:44.060
what happened to your hands?

06:44.128 --> 06:54.738
[panting]

06:54.805 --> 06:59.309
It started when I was a kid.

06:59.377 --> 07:02.312
They would just make me so

07:02.380 --> 07:03.947
Angry.

07:04.015 --> 07:07.951
[grunting]

07:08.019 --> 07:11.788
I had to have them gone.

07:11.856 --> 07:13.857
I didn't even care about

07:13.925 --> 07:17.260
The hurt.

07:17.328 --> 07:20.196
I would have lost them all if my

07:20.264 --> 07:22.532
Mother hadn't figured out

07:22.600 --> 07:27.470
A creative way to make me stop.

07:27.538 --> 07:31.074
[panting]

07:31.142 --> 07:34.978
Eventually, they gave up on me.

07:35.046 --> 07:39.749
They put me in a home. I've been

07:39.817 --> 07:41.584
Using assisted living for

07:41.652 --> 07:43.486
30 years.

07:43.554 --> 07:45.722
if you hadn't, you would have

07:45.790 --> 07:48.792
Killed yourself. Most patients

07:48.859 --> 07:54.497
Do. Life expectancy is 45.

07:54.565 --> 07:56.299
and you just turned 46.

07:56.367 --> 08:00.036
yeah. I never thought I'd

08:00.104 --> 08:03.306
Make it that long.

08:03.374 --> 08:04.708
[exhales]

08:04.775 --> 08:07.610
But I did. [laughs]

08:07.678 --> 08:12.349
I did.

08:12.416 --> 08:15.952
now, if we do fix your lips,

08:16.020 --> 08:17.020
How do you know it won't happen

08:17.088 --> 08:19.823
Again?

08:19.890 --> 08:20.957
we don't.

08:21.025 --> 08:22.525
what do you mean "we don't,"

08:22.593 --> 08:25.895
Asshole? [grunts]

08:25.963 --> 08:31.468
I'm sorry. It's just--

08:31.535 --> 08:35.472
I've been self-destructing my

08:35.539 --> 08:40.010
Whole life, and despite all

08:40.077 --> 08:45.515
The odds, I'm still...Here.

08:45.583 --> 08:48.752
I think that means that I

08:48.819 --> 08:53.523
Deserve a fresh start.

08:53.591 --> 09:05.035
Don't you?

09:05.102 --> 09:07.003
breaks my heart, that guy.

09:07.071 --> 09:08.071
[scoffs]

09:08.139 --> 09:08.805
this is one of those cases,

09:08.873 --> 09:10.640
You know? Makes me feel like I

09:10.708 --> 09:11.574
Actually did something, earned

09:11.642 --> 09:12.776
That award.

09:12.843 --> 09:13.676
you know what I like about

09:13.744 --> 09:15.211
This case? Sooner or later,

09:15.279 --> 09:16.346
Nychen-schlichen is going to

09:16.414 --> 09:17.480
Bite those lips off again, and,

09:17.548 --> 09:19.816
Well, there's another 15 grand

09:19.884 --> 09:20.717
From his trust fund in our

09:20.785 --> 09:21.818
Pockets.

09:21.886 --> 09:23.053
do you have any ideals

09:23.120 --> 09:25.121
Anymore? Any desire to heal or

09:25.189 --> 09:26.389
Help? I'm just asking.

09:26.457 --> 09:27.490
seanie, I was always

09:27.558 --> 09:28.958
A pragmatist and a businessman,

09:29.026 --> 09:30.927
Huh? Did you ever hear me say I

09:30.995 --> 09:32.829
Wanted to save the world, hmm?

09:32.897 --> 09:34.431
All I wanted was perks and

09:34.498 --> 09:36.966
A glamorous lifestyle. And you

09:37.034 --> 09:38.034
Are never going to guilt me or

09:38.102 --> 09:38.968
Change me. Don't you know that

09:39.036 --> 09:39.636
By now?

09:39.703 --> 09:40.904
I think I live in a kind of

09:40.971 --> 09:41.771
Denial about it.

09:41.839 --> 09:43.406
oh, come on. Lighten up.

09:43.474 --> 09:44.340
We're on the verge of a great

09:44.408 --> 09:46.142
Future here, my friend. You're

09:46.210 --> 09:47.343
Going to love the marble I

09:47.411 --> 09:48.244
Picked out for the retaining

09:48.312 --> 09:49.546
Wall in the new recovery suite.

09:49.613 --> 09:51.748
It is the perfect spot to

09:51.816 --> 09:53.016
Showcase the albert poland

09:53.084 --> 09:54.084
Award.

09:54.151 --> 09:54.884
[indistinct chattering]

09:54.952 --> 09:57.120
[metal clangs]

09:57.188 --> 09:57.954
[hammering]

09:58.022 --> 10:00.990
oh. There you are, christian.

10:01.058 --> 10:02.258
Put your eyes on this.

10:02.326 --> 10:04.227
oh, my. Would you look at

10:04.295 --> 10:06.129
This? It's so smooth, huh? And

10:06.197 --> 10:07.764
Decadent. Isn't it great, huh?

10:07.832 --> 10:08.765
What do you think, sean?

10:08.833 --> 10:09.532
how much is it?

10:09.600 --> 10:10.834
1,500.

10:10.901 --> 10:11.501
I love it.

10:11.569 --> 10:12.302
well, that's pretty good for

10:12.369 --> 10:13.036
The whole wall.

10:13.104 --> 10:14.337
a square foot. It's

10:14.405 --> 10:15.839
Chinchilla mink marble.

10:15.906 --> 10:17.640
forget it. I agreed to this

10:17.708 --> 10:18.875
Because I thought a better,

10:18.943 --> 10:20.477
State-of-the-art recovery suite

10:20.544 --> 10:22.078
Was a good idea. But all this

10:22.146 --> 10:23.546
Stuff--the new lounge,

10:23.614 --> 10:24.514
The marble wall dividing

10:24.582 --> 10:25.248
The rooms--

10:25.316 --> 10:26.549
10 times more chic than some

10:26.617 --> 10:28.651
Sloppy dividing curtain, my

10:28.719 --> 10:29.319
Friend.

10:29.386 --> 10:30.920
it's ostentatious.

10:30.988 --> 10:32.889
it is an investment, all

10:32.957 --> 10:34.457
Right? This is rodeo drive.

10:34.525 --> 10:36.459
We need the bling, my friend.

10:36.527 --> 10:37.494
I love these colors.

10:37.561 --> 10:39.429
for once, I'd like to be

10:39.497 --> 10:41.030
Ahead of the game financially

10:41.098 --> 10:42.165
Instead of always having debts

10:42.233 --> 10:43.399
Over our heads. And you want to

10:43.467 --> 10:44.501
Put us back in the hole for

10:44.568 --> 10:45.602
A wall that would serve the same

10:45.669 --> 10:47.370
Purpose if it was stucco.

10:47.438 --> 10:48.538
I wasn't paid to do stucco,

10:48.606 --> 10:50.673
Sean. You look cheap, you are

10:50.741 --> 10:51.441
Cheap.

10:51.509 --> 10:53.843
uh, excuse me, rebecca--

10:53.911 --> 10:56.079
That's your name, right? Um,

10:56.147 --> 10:57.914
What's with these skylights?

10:57.982 --> 10:59.115
They're half the size that I

10:59.183 --> 11:00.316
Told you to make them.

11:00.384 --> 11:02.152
hi, hon.

11:02.219 --> 11:03.086
hi.

11:03.154 --> 11:05.188
I downsized them. Frankly,

11:05.256 --> 11:07.524
Mrs. Troy, they were garish.

11:07.591 --> 11:10.527
oh. Well, they were actually

11:10.594 --> 11:11.794
Modeled after the ones christian

11:11.862 --> 11:13.897
And I saw on our honeymoon in

11:13.964 --> 11:15.632
Provence, so you need to tear

11:15.699 --> 11:17.367
Them out and redo them now.

11:17.434 --> 11:18.301
no. Just leave them the way

11:18.369 --> 11:19.435
They are, ok? It would cost

11:19.503 --> 11:21.037
Thousands to redo them.

11:21.105 --> 11:22.872
sean, you worry too much.

11:22.940 --> 11:23.840
Besides, how can I do

11:23.908 --> 11:25.375
The italian motif in the new

11:25.442 --> 11:27.010
Bathroom when I am out here

11:27.077 --> 11:28.011
Doing these?

11:28.078 --> 11:29.412
what new bathroom?

11:29.480 --> 11:30.480
go look at it. It's

11:30.548 --> 11:32.982
Beautiful. At least, it will be

11:33.050 --> 11:34.083
When I'm done decorating it.

11:34.151 --> 11:36.186
sean...

11:36.253 --> 11:39.422
christian, this one is going

11:39.490 --> 11:40.256
To be a problem for me.

11:40.324 --> 11:41.124
why don't you just go talk

11:41.192 --> 11:43.059
[indistinct] off the ledge,

11:43.127 --> 11:46.396
Please? Hmm? Huh? Huh?

11:46.463 --> 11:48.031
mmm.

11:48.098 --> 11:50.800
[chuckles]

11:50.868 --> 11:51.768
You don't have to worry about

11:51.835 --> 11:53.036
Sean, ok?

11:53.103 --> 11:53.836
I'm not.

11:53.904 --> 11:54.637
good.

11:54.705 --> 11:55.538
but I don't care how much you

11:55.606 --> 11:56.940
Pay me, I can't work with that

11:57.007 --> 11:57.774
Bitch.

11:57.841 --> 11:59.008
whoa, whoa, whoa. That bitch

11:59.076 --> 11:59.943
Is my wife.

12:00.010 --> 12:00.777
which is why you should be

12:00.844 --> 12:01.711
Thanking me.

12:01.779 --> 12:03.012
for what?

12:03.080 --> 12:03.913
for waiting for her to leave

12:03.981 --> 12:04.814
Before I told you that I was

12:04.882 --> 12:06.716
Pregnant, shitdick. Nice job

12:06.784 --> 12:15.558
Pulling out.

12:15.626 --> 12:17.894
[monitor beeping]

12:17.962 --> 12:19.395
*tonight,

12:19.463 --> 12:22.432
I'm going to have myself

12:22.499 --> 12:25.034
A real good time,

12:25.102 --> 12:30.173
I feel alive,

12:30.241 --> 12:33.142
And the world

12:33.210 --> 12:36.613
Turning inside out,

12:36.680 --> 12:37.714
Yeah,

12:37.781 --> 12:40.183
And floating around

12:40.251 --> 12:42.218
In ecstasy,

12:42.286 --> 12:47.490
So don't stop me now,

12:47.558 --> 12:49.158
Don't stop me

12:49.226 --> 12:51.394
'cause I'm having a good time,

12:51.462 --> 12:52.962
Having a good time,

12:53.030 --> 12:53.730
I'm a shooting star

12:53.797 --> 12:55.498
Leaping through the sky

12:55.566 --> 12:56.766
Like a tiger,

12:56.834 --> 13:00.303
Defying the laws of gravity,

13:00.371 --> 13:01.671
I'm a racing car

13:01.739 --> 13:02.405
Passing by... *

13:02.473 --> 13:04.207
whoa. Nice work there, doc,

13:04.275 --> 13:06.276
Huh? That's why they say you got

13:06.343 --> 13:08.745
The, uh, golden hands, huh?

13:08.812 --> 13:09.779
they're the same color they

13:09.847 --> 13:11.914
Were yesterday. Don't believe

13:11.982 --> 13:12.915
Your own hype.

13:12.983 --> 13:15.418
ha. I happen to admire your

13:15.486 --> 13:18.054
Hands, which is why, of all

13:18.122 --> 13:19.889
The surgeons in the country, I'm

13:19.957 --> 13:20.923
Going to ask you to do my

13:20.991 --> 13:22.759
Vasectomy.

13:22.826 --> 13:23.926
[scoffs] talk about

13:23.994 --> 13:26.195
An unnecessary surgery. Kimber

13:26.263 --> 13:27.130
Can't even have any kids

13:27.197 --> 13:28.731
Anymore.

13:28.799 --> 13:29.832
but our hot little decorator

13:29.900 --> 13:32.168
Can. Apparently, I have super

13:32.236 --> 13:33.369
Sperm. Every time I look at

13:33.437 --> 13:35.138
A chick, she gets pregnant.

13:35.205 --> 13:38.441
jesus, christian. You're

13:38.509 --> 13:39.676
About to be given a lifetime

13:39.743 --> 13:40.877
Achievement award. Could you

13:40.944 --> 13:42.278
Possibly just grow up?

13:42.346 --> 13:44.347
we have made it, sean.

13:44.415 --> 13:45.315
The gate to the garden of

13:45.382 --> 13:46.616
Earthly delights is wide open

13:46.684 --> 13:47.884
For us now. You think I'm going

13:47.951 --> 13:49.452
To say no to all that sweet

13:49.520 --> 13:50.586
Nectar because of a silly little

13:50.654 --> 13:53.022
Thing like pollination?

13:53.090 --> 13:54.624
what about a little thing

13:54.692 --> 13:56.859
Called marriage? You're

13:56.927 --> 13:59.095
Unbelievable.

13:59.163 --> 13:59.996
* I don't want to stop

14:00.064 --> 14:00.663
At all *

14:00.731 --> 14:02.950
oh, come on.

14:11.018 --> 14:13.286
swelling looks good. Blood

14:13.354 --> 14:16.089
Flow's returning. No sign of

14:16.157 --> 14:17.991
An infection. I think you're

14:18.059 --> 14:21.828
Going to like it.

14:21.896 --> 14:24.731
[grunts]

14:24.799 --> 14:27.534
here. Just hold this.

14:27.602 --> 14:33.740
There you go.

14:33.808 --> 14:38.445
So what do you think?

14:38.513 --> 14:39.112
[grunts]

14:39.180 --> 14:40.013
yeah. They're going to be

14:40.081 --> 14:41.348
A little tender at first, but

14:41.415 --> 14:42.916
There are some exercises you can

14:42.984 --> 14:44.317
Do to help break them in. Try

14:44.385 --> 14:45.919
Saying "sea shell" for me.

14:45.987 --> 14:50.490
mmm.

14:50.558 --> 14:53.793
[panting]

14:53.861 --> 14:55.195
See sell.

14:55.263 --> 14:58.198
mm-hmm. Good. Basketball.

14:58.266 --> 15:01.601
uh, asket all.

15:01.669 --> 15:02.402
uh-huh. Now, this one's

15:02.470 --> 15:05.672
A little bit harder. Ping pong.

15:05.740 --> 15:09.876
huh...F-f-fu--

15:09.944 --> 15:10.544
ping.

15:10.611 --> 15:12.879
ff-ff--

15:12.947 --> 15:14.014
keep trying.

15:14.081 --> 15:17.817
no. F-fen--

15:17.885 --> 15:19.119
Fen--

15:19.187 --> 15:22.556
Fen too close.

15:22.623 --> 15:23.723
aah!

15:23.791 --> 15:25.725
[grunting]

15:25.793 --> 15:29.062
I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.

15:29.130 --> 15:31.731
[both grunting]

15:31.799 --> 15:33.233
what's going on?

15:33.301 --> 15:34.067
the hell? We were just

15:34.135 --> 15:34.901
Talking, and then, the next

15:34.969 --> 15:35.735
Thing I know--

15:35.803 --> 15:37.003
jesus. Why doesn't he have

15:37.071 --> 15:38.138
His restraints on?

15:38.206 --> 15:39.406
I let him loose just for

15:39.473 --> 15:40.240
A second.

15:40.308 --> 15:42.242
you let him loose? Why?

15:42.310 --> 15:43.210
well, he seemed--I don't

15:43.277 --> 15:44.077
Know--better.

15:44.145 --> 15:44.911
[grunts]

15:44.979 --> 15:45.612
[panting]

15:45.680 --> 15:47.714
better? He's got a genetic

15:47.782 --> 15:49.583
Disease, sean. What do you

15:49.650 --> 15:50.483
Think, 'cause you fix his lips,

15:50.551 --> 15:51.885
He's normal again?

15:51.953 --> 15:55.121
[pants] I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

15:55.189 --> 15:56.323
no. You can't blame this on

15:56.390 --> 15:58.258
Him.

15:58.326 --> 15:59.326
I'm sorry.

15:59.393 --> 15:59.993
you ok?

16:00.061 --> 16:01.494
yeah.

16:01.562 --> 16:05.198
I'm sorry. [grunts and pants]

16:05.266 --> 16:06.132
[exhales] come on. Let's get

16:06.200 --> 16:09.369
You some stitches.

16:09.437 --> 16:10.570
next time you're being chased

16:10.638 --> 16:11.771
Through campus by an angry

16:11.839 --> 16:13.473
Professor, wear pants.

16:13.541 --> 16:15.175
how could I? [laughs] I think

16:15.243 --> 16:16.576
His wife broke the zipper when

16:16.644 --> 16:18.545
She bit them off me. I'm just

16:18.613 --> 16:20.146
Lucky that guy's so damn slow.

16:20.214 --> 16:21.248
[both laugh]

16:21.315 --> 16:22.282
hey, this isn't my fault,

16:22.350 --> 16:23.283
Sean. I just went over there to

16:23.351 --> 16:24.684
Talk my "d" up to a "c" on that

16:24.752 --> 16:26.453
Cellular physiology exam.

16:26.520 --> 16:27.420
yeah? Well, how does that

16:27.488 --> 16:29.189
Lead to you screwing his wife?

16:29.257 --> 16:31.791
he wasn't home. [chuckles]

16:31.859 --> 16:33.493
[laughs]

16:33.561 --> 16:34.561
oh, hey, sean, I need to

16:34.629 --> 16:35.862
Borrow your notes on that

16:35.930 --> 16:37.364
Cellular physiology term paper.

16:37.431 --> 16:38.398
I'm already stuck with a "d" now

16:38.466 --> 16:39.532
On the exam. I got to kill on

16:39.600 --> 16:40.333
That pap]r.

16:40.401 --> 16:44.804
what's in it for me?

16:44.872 --> 16:45.605
you know that blonde that

16:45.673 --> 16:46.373
You've been eying?

16:46.440 --> 16:47.340
julia?

16:47.408 --> 16:49.009
I know her. I can introduce

16:49.076 --> 16:50.076
You.

16:50.144 --> 16:52.078
did you sleep with her?

16:52.146 --> 16:53.580
not yet.

16:53.648 --> 16:55.382
all right. Fine. But you have

16:55.449 --> 16:56.549
To talk me up to her.

16:56.617 --> 16:59.252
mm. No problem. I'm a born

16:59.320 --> 17:02.222
Liar.

17:02.290 --> 17:04.723
Ok. All right.

17:04.791 --> 17:05.791
How am I doing down there? Am I

17:05.859 --> 17:07.093
Fixed yet?

17:07.161 --> 17:08.728
almost. Just finishing up

17:08.796 --> 17:09.628
The keyhole.

17:09.696 --> 17:10.896
[exhales]

17:10.964 --> 17:12.198
you're lucky, you know. These

17:12.266 --> 17:13.433
Hemostat vasectomies are far

17:13.501 --> 17:14.701
Less painful.

17:14.769 --> 17:15.702
what's a little pain exchange

17:15.770 --> 17:18.104
For a lifetime of free love?

17:18.172 --> 17:19.239
yeah. That's exactly what you

17:19.307 --> 17:21.340
Need, even fewer reasons to

17:21.409 --> 17:22.409
Control yourself.

17:22.476 --> 17:23.476
[paper rustles]

17:23.544 --> 17:26.012
well, congratulations. You

17:26.079 --> 17:28.348
Are now medically prevented from

17:28.415 --> 17:29.616
Producing unwanted children.

17:29.684 --> 17:30.483
[ice pack clatters]

17:30.551 --> 17:33.119
oh. Great. [exhales] 3's my

17:33.187 --> 17:34.821
Limit.

17:34.889 --> 17:35.488
what are you going to do

17:35.556 --> 17:36.690
About, um--

17:36.757 --> 17:37.524
what?

17:37.591 --> 17:38.291
rebecca?

17:38.359 --> 17:40.593
yeah, well, she got rid of

17:40.661 --> 17:44.531
It. Don't worry.

17:44.598 --> 17:45.265
what are you guys doing in

17:45.333 --> 17:45.932
Here?

17:46.000 --> 17:47.434
hmm?

17:47.501 --> 17:50.270
what are you doing in here?

17:50.338 --> 17:53.073
nothing. Sean was just...

17:53.140 --> 17:55.575
Burning off some genital warts,

17:55.643 --> 17:57.210
That's all.

17:57.278 --> 17:58.311
well, I'm sure your wife will

17:58.379 --> 17:59.879
Be pleased about that. She's in

17:59.947 --> 18:02.982
Your office.

18:03.050 --> 18:04.918
shit. She can't see me like

18:04.985 --> 18:06.319
This. You need to cover for me.

18:06.387 --> 18:08.088
but--what do you want me to

18:08.155 --> 18:08.922
Tell her?

18:08.989 --> 18:09.789
I don't know. Tell her I'm

18:09.857 --> 18:10.490
With a patient or something. I

18:10.558 --> 18:11.791
Mean, you know--just--she finds

18:11.859 --> 18:12.692
Out I've had a vasectomy,

18:12.760 --> 18:14.961
She'll--kill me.

18:15.029 --> 18:15.795
what are you going to do when

18:15.863 --> 18:16.963
It all catches up with you?

18:17.031 --> 18:18.698
I've paid my penance, sean,

18:18.766 --> 18:20.033
All right? Foster care, breast

18:20.101 --> 18:20.800
Cancer, all the bullshit I've

18:20.868 --> 18:22.235
Had to put up with you for I

18:22.303 --> 18:23.970
Don't know how long. Just cover

18:24.038 --> 18:27.707
For me, please.

18:27.775 --> 18:29.509
hey, sean.

18:29.577 --> 18:31.978
kimber. Um--uh--christian is

18:32.046 --> 18:33.346
Just--he's finishing up with

18:33.414 --> 18:35.648
A patient, so, um--how are you?

18:35.716 --> 18:36.950
God, you look fantastic.

18:37.017 --> 18:37.717
yh?

18:37.785 --> 18:39.018
marriage obviously agrees

18:39.086 --> 18:39.786
With you.

18:39.854 --> 18:40.787
[chuckles] thank you. Who

18:40.855 --> 18:41.621
Would have ever thought we'd be

18:41.689 --> 18:43.823
An old married couple?

18:43.891 --> 18:45.024
so, how's the decorating

18:45.092 --> 18:46.426
Thing going? You know, I don't

18:46.494 --> 18:47.861
Think we've had a chance to talk

18:47.928 --> 18:50.063
Since the wedding.

18:50.131 --> 18:51.030
you know, actually, it's

18:51.098 --> 18:52.265
Going really good. I have a lot

18:52.333 --> 18:54.033
Of really good ideas. I think I

18:54.101 --> 18:55.735
Have a natural gift, or at least

18:55.803 --> 18:59.606
My teachers think so. Well.

18:59.673 --> 19:01.408
What--what do you think of that

19:01.475 --> 19:02.876
New marble wall?

19:02.943 --> 19:06.479
it's, uh...Really christian's

19:06.547 --> 19:07.514
Thing.

19:07.581 --> 19:08.915
yeah. He always has to do

19:08.983 --> 19:10.417
What that fat, untalented woman

19:10.484 --> 19:11.851
Says every time, doesn't he?

19:11.919 --> 19:14.621
[chuckles] she's emperor's new

19:14.688 --> 19:16.756
Clothes, if you ask me.

19:16.824 --> 19:18.024
well, she does come highly

19:18.092 --> 19:19.926
Recommended, and you know how

19:19.994 --> 19:21.261
Christian is about people and

19:21.328 --> 19:23.463
Their...Credentials.

19:23.531 --> 19:24.297
what do you think if we put

19:24.365 --> 19:26.599
Some food coloring in here, make

19:26.667 --> 19:27.700
The tank prettier--like, maybe

19:27.768 --> 19:29.602
An aquamarine--make the room

19:29.670 --> 19:30.570
Pop?

19:30.638 --> 19:32.005
bet that would kill the fish,

19:32.072 --> 19:35.375
Kimber.

19:35.443 --> 19:39.279
he's screwing her, isn't he?

19:39.346 --> 19:40.914
wh--who?

19:40.981 --> 19:43.049
I'm not stupid. Christian.

19:43.117 --> 19:43.850
Rebecca. They're having

19:43.918 --> 19:45.018
An affair.

19:45.085 --> 19:47.420
oh--you know, he has turned

19:47.488 --> 19:48.855
A corner. He wants it to work

19:48.923 --> 19:51.391
With you. And I think he's had

19:51.459 --> 19:53.226
His fill of all that.

19:53.294 --> 19:54.527
ok. So tell me what you know,

19:54.595 --> 19:55.595
Tell me now, and don't lie to

19:55.663 --> 19:57.330
Me.

19:57.398 --> 20:04.871
kimber...

20:04.939 --> 20:07.373
Does he have random

20:07.441 --> 20:09.642
Christian-like thoughts?

20:09.710 --> 20:13.046
Yeah. I'm sure he does. But

20:13.113 --> 20:15.915
The bottom line is that he loves

20:15.983 --> 20:19.619
You, and he is faithful...

20:19.687 --> 20:22.822
To you.

20:22.890 --> 20:28.728
And you can trust him.

20:28.796 --> 20:29.996
well, you know that's why I

20:30.064 --> 20:31.931
Came here today, right? To make

20:31.999 --> 20:35.602
Him tell me the truth. So, thank

20:35.669 --> 20:37.203
You. Thanks for being honest

20:37.271 --> 20:38.872
With me, sean. You have no idea

20:38.939 --> 20:47.347
How relieved I am now.

20:47.414 --> 20:50.350
[sighs]

20:50.417 --> 20:51.451
ahh, thank you.

20:51.519 --> 20:53.353
mmm. You've had enough, sean.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.220
you're damn right, I've had

20:54.288 --> 20:54.888
Enough.

20:54.955 --> 20:55.655
he doesn't need this. Thank

20:55.723 --> 20:56.322
You very much.

20:56.390 --> 20:57.557
miss, don't believe a word

20:57.625 --> 20:58.558
That comes out of this man's

20:58.626 --> 20:59.826
Mouth, ok? He'll tell you

20:59.894 --> 21:00.994
Anything you want to hear, and

21:01.061 --> 21:02.495
None of it's true. Just ask his

21:02.563 --> 21:03.630
Wife.

21:03.697 --> 21:04.364
[scoffs]

21:04.431 --> 21:06.666
[chuckles]

21:06.734 --> 21:08.735
look, I'm sorry if I put you

21:08.802 --> 21:10.103
In an uncomfortable position--

21:10.170 --> 21:11.938
uncomfortable position?

21:12.006 --> 21:13.172
yes, uncomfortable position.

21:13.240 --> 21:13.940
oh, come on. You wouldn't

21:14.008 --> 21:15.208
Care if I squatted on glass, as

21:15.276 --> 21:17.410
Long as your ass is covered.

21:17.478 --> 21:19.412
Nothing's changed in 25 years.

21:19.480 --> 21:20.980
[sighs]

21:21.048 --> 21:22.815
oh. You know, maybe you can't

21:22.883 --> 21:24.217
Help lying and cheating. Maybe

21:24.285 --> 21:25.485
It's a genetic trait like

21:25.553 --> 21:26.419
Lesch-nyhan.

21:26.487 --> 21:27.086
mm-hmm.

21:27.154 --> 21:27.954
and you can't evolve into

21:28.022 --> 21:28.888
A decent human being 'cause it's

21:28.956 --> 21:30.390
Not in your dna. Excuse me,

21:30.457 --> 21:31.991
Honey, get another one?

21:32.059 --> 21:33.960
mmm. And can I get some ice?

21:34.028 --> 21:36.195
My balls. I had the ol'

21:36.263 --> 21:36.996
Snippety-snip. I want to make

21:37.064 --> 21:38.531
Sure I don't swell during

21:38.599 --> 21:41.301
The flight.

21:41.368 --> 21:50.376
[sighs]

21:50.444 --> 21:52.078
[grunts]

21:52.146 --> 21:56.349
[sighs] thank god. [exhales]

21:56.417 --> 22:01.454
I almost missed it.

22:01.522 --> 22:03.122
[indistinct chattering]

22:03.190 --> 22:04.290
you have a much more

22:04.358 --> 22:05.725
Interesting job. Now, what kind

22:05.793 --> 22:08.695
Of chocolate do you sell?

22:08.762 --> 22:09.896
I'll give you a sample.

22:09.964 --> 22:10.730
oh, you have some here?

22:10.798 --> 22:11.397
mm-hmm.

22:11.465 --> 22:12.932
great. Yeah.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.469
well, let's see. For you...

22:16.537 --> 22:18.037
Ok.

22:18.105 --> 22:20.807
ahh. Ooh.

22:20.874 --> 22:21.774
this...

22:21.842 --> 22:22.909
[sighs]

22:22.977 --> 22:25.378
is made from criollo cacao,

22:25.446 --> 22:26.579
Grown in nicaragua.

22:26.647 --> 22:27.780
oh, I love how you say that.

22:27.848 --> 22:31.884
[both laugh]

22:31.952 --> 22:32.719
oh.

22:32.786 --> 22:34.120
it has higher levels of

22:34.188 --> 22:35.154
Phentolamine...

22:35.222 --> 22:36.990
mmm.

22:37.057 --> 22:39.459
which, besides its decadent

22:39.526 --> 22:40.893
Taste, is known to have

22:40.961 --> 22:44.364
A slightly psychotropic effect.

22:44.431 --> 22:45.865
oh, it is so delicious.

22:45.933 --> 22:48.301
[chuckles] you want another?

22:48.369 --> 22:50.003
oh, yeah. Yeah.

22:50.070 --> 23:00.079
I'll split it with you.

23:00.147 --> 23:00.780
wow.

23:00.848 --> 23:03.016
mmm.

23:03.083 --> 23:03.983
[chuckles]

23:04.051 --> 23:05.518
[chuckles]

23:05.586 --> 23:06.252
you know, I need to use

23:06.320 --> 23:08.988
The bathroom.

23:09.056 --> 23:13.292
You want to come?

23:13.360 --> 23:14.327
you saying you want to join

23:14.395 --> 23:16.062
The mile high club?

23:16.130 --> 23:18.364
give me 2 minutes.

23:18.432 --> 23:26.472
ok.

23:26.540 --> 23:27.607
don't do it.

23:27.675 --> 23:29.542
[chuckles] like you wouldn't.

23:29.610 --> 23:31.010
I have. It's not worth it,

23:31.078 --> 23:32.178
All right? The bathrooms are too

23:32.246 --> 23:33.413
Small to get any rhythm going,

23:33.480 --> 23:36.082
And...Flight attendants are very

23:36.150 --> 23:37.483
Strict post-9/11.

23:37.551 --> 23:39.886
I tell you what, buddy boy.

23:39.953 --> 23:41.721
Why don't you cover for me? See

23:41.789 --> 23:43.923
How it feels for a change.

23:43.991 --> 23:44.624
[clears throat]

23:44.692 --> 23:57.603
don't say I didn't warn you.

23:57.671 --> 23:58.571
mmm.

23:58.639 --> 24:00.740
[grunting]

24:00.808 --> 24:02.175
Oh, god!

24:02.242 --> 24:04.711
[both grunting]

24:04.778 --> 24:08.014
oh, god. Don't stop. Ahh.

24:08.082 --> 24:09.682
Don't stop. Ahh! Ahh!

24:09.750 --> 24:10.516
[knock on door]

24:10.584 --> 24:12.985
excuse me? Open this door.

24:13.053 --> 24:14.220
You need to come out of there.

24:14.288 --> 24:14.987
oh!

24:15.055 --> 24:16.222
come out of there now, or

24:16.290 --> 24:17.156
The captain will land this

24:17.157 --> 24:17.857
Plane.

24:17.925 --> 24:20.493
[moaning]

24:20.561 --> 24:22.261
[both grunting]

24:22.329 --> 24:23.830
u.S. Marshal.

24:23.897 --> 24:25.131
ahh.

24:25.199 --> 24:26.499
[knock on door]

24:26.567 --> 24:27.834
wait. Wait. Wait.

24:27.901 --> 24:29.635
[panting]

24:29.703 --> 24:30.770
[knock on door]

24:30.838 --> 24:35.742
u.S. Marshal.

24:35.809 --> 24:37.043
[grunts and pants]

24:37.111 --> 24:38.077
are you armed?

24:38.145 --> 24:38.878
no.

24:38.946 --> 24:39.812
you are being detained under

24:39.880 --> 24:41.047
The u.S. Anti-terrorism

24:41.115 --> 24:42.715
Provision of the patriot act for

24:42.783 --> 24:43.816
Disobeying a flight crew while

24:43.884 --> 24:44.584
In the air.

24:44.651 --> 24:48.020
ooh.

24:48.088 --> 24:48.888
I have the authority to

24:48.956 --> 24:50.189
Handcuff to your seat if I deem

24:50.257 --> 24:52.125
It necessary. Stay seated till

24:52.192 --> 24:53.760
We land in miami, at which time

24:53.827 --> 24:54.761
You will be questioned by

24:54.828 --> 24:56.129
Homeland security. Do you

24:56.196 --> 24:57.163
Understand?

24:57.231 --> 24:59.031
yeah. Yes.

24:59.099 --> 25:03.636
[panting]

25:03.704 --> 25:04.303
[pats]

25:04.371 --> 25:05.004
shut up.

25:05.072 --> 25:05.705
it's all right, buddy.

25:05.773 --> 25:07.058
just shut up.

25:09.343 --> 25:10.110
why is it you never get

25:10.177 --> 25:11.444
Caught, and whenever I break

25:11.512 --> 25:12.278
The rules--

25:12.346 --> 25:13.112
'cause you, my friend, are

25:13.180 --> 25:13.946
An am amateur. Thank you so

25:14.014 --> 25:14.981
Much. Oh. You can't expect to

25:15.048 --> 25:16.582
Play like tiger woods if you

25:16.650 --> 25:17.316
Don't practice.

25:17.384 --> 25:18.117
thanks for doing nothing, by

25:18.185 --> 25:19.752
The way. Think of all the times

25:19.820 --> 25:22.221
I covered for you. If she hadn't

25:22.288 --> 25:23.355
Convinced them that I was giving

25:23.423 --> 25:24.289
Her the heimlich maneuver, I'd

25:24.357 --> 25:25.157
Still be in custody.

25:25.225 --> 25:25.958
you know what? You need to

25:26.026 --> 25:27.159
Put that all behind you. Suck it

25:27.227 --> 25:29.061
All in. Take a look around. Can

25:29.129 --> 25:29.895
You feel it?

25:29.963 --> 25:31.230
hmm. Respect?

25:31.297 --> 25:33.365
envy. Nothing says success

25:33.433 --> 25:34.633
More than the jealousy of your

25:34.701 --> 25:36.201
Peers.

25:36.269 --> 25:37.102
dr. Troy?

25:37.170 --> 25:37.770
yes?

25:37.837 --> 25:38.537
do you mind if I steal you

25:38.605 --> 25:39.338
For a moment?

25:39.406 --> 25:40.139
mmm.

25:40.206 --> 25:41.206
I promised candace delaureo I

25:41.274 --> 25:42.274
Would bring you over the moment

25:42.342 --> 25:44.410
You arrived. Apparently, you

25:44.477 --> 25:45.944
Made quite an impression on her

25:46.012 --> 25:47.112
When you were a student.

25:47.180 --> 25:47.980
sweetie, do you mind?

25:48.048 --> 25:50.653
[laughs]

25:54.721 --> 25:55.954
hey, could I just get a cup

25:56.022 --> 25:57.089
Of coffee?

25:57.157 --> 25:58.123
how do you take it?

25:58.191 --> 26:00.025
black, as I recall from

26:00.093 --> 26:00.993
The all-nighters we used to

26:01.061 --> 26:01.660
Pull.

26:01.728 --> 26:02.928
curtis?

26:02.996 --> 26:05.597
older, wiser. Eh. Mostly

26:05.665 --> 26:06.665
Older. [laughs]

26:06.733 --> 26:08.300
oh, my god. Hey!

26:08.368 --> 26:09.068
how you doing, buddy?

26:09.135 --> 26:09.768
I'm good. How are you?

26:09.836 --> 26:11.036
congratulations, mcnamara.

26:11.104 --> 26:12.071
oh, thank you.

26:12.138 --> 26:13.138
a beer, please. I got to tell

26:13.206 --> 26:14.039
You, I was a little shocked when

26:14.107 --> 26:14.840
I heard you won the poland

26:14.908 --> 26:16.008
Award. You must do one hell of

26:16.076 --> 26:17.443
A tit job.

26:17.510 --> 26:18.510
well, we do a little more

26:18.578 --> 26:19.478
Than tit jobs.

26:19.546 --> 26:20.913
I'm just teasing you. Relax,

26:20.980 --> 26:21.814
Sean. You never could take

26:21.881 --> 26:26.285
A joke, yeah? [laughs]

26:26.352 --> 26:27.252
well, I'm not surprised

26:27.320 --> 26:28.153
You're receiving it.

26:28.221 --> 26:28.987
oh.

26:29.055 --> 26:29.688
work you've been doing,

26:29.756 --> 26:31.323
Treating fevers in angola and

26:31.391 --> 26:32.758
Pakistan is pretty incredible.

26:32.826 --> 26:34.560
oh, thanks, buddy. We're

26:34.627 --> 26:36.528
Lucky, though, you know, sean?

26:36.596 --> 26:38.297
Most poor bastards, they never

26:38.364 --> 26:39.364
Get to find out what their true

26:39.432 --> 26:43.969
Purpose in life is, eh?

26:44.037 --> 26:46.739
So, uh, so how's julia?

26:46.806 --> 26:47.873
she's good.

26:47.941 --> 26:48.774
yeah?

26:48.842 --> 26:49.975
we divorced.

26:50.043 --> 26:51.577
oh. Gee. I'm sorry about

26:51.644 --> 26:53.979
That. You have kids?

26:54.047 --> 26:55.814
yeah. Yeah. 3.

26:55.882 --> 26:57.449
oh!

26:57.517 --> 26:59.518
there.

26:59.586 --> 27:00.452
There's matt.

27:00.520 --> 27:01.386
uh-huh.

27:01.454 --> 27:02.821
that's conor there, and

27:02.889 --> 27:03.655
There's annie.

27:03.723 --> 27:04.423
wow, good-looking.

27:04.491 --> 27:05.157
yeah.

27:05.225 --> 27:05.858
you must be really proud.

27:05.925 --> 27:06.558
I am.

27:06.626 --> 27:07.326
what, so the oldest one's

27:07.393 --> 27:08.327
Probably in college, right?

27:08.394 --> 27:09.995
uh, well, he's--he's just

27:10.063 --> 27:11.163
Taking a break.

27:11.231 --> 27:12.831
ah. Smart. Smart. Let me show

27:12.899 --> 27:16.235
You my crew here. This is luke

27:16.302 --> 27:18.237
And andrea. Luke is at the old

27:18.304 --> 27:19.371
Alma mater following in his

27:19.439 --> 27:20.672
Dad's footsteps.

27:20.740 --> 27:21.340
oh, great.

27:21.407 --> 27:23.742
but andrea, she's a rebel.

27:23.810 --> 27:24.843
Nothing but trouble.

27:24.911 --> 27:26.979
heh. I got one of those, too.

27:27.046 --> 27:28.547
just had to be different, you

27:28.615 --> 27:32.451
Know? Yale. I swear she did it

27:32.519 --> 27:34.286
To break my heart. [chuckles]

27:34.354 --> 27:36.889
we can't all go to harvard,

27:36.956 --> 27:37.756
Can we?

27:37.824 --> 27:39.057
well, some of us could but

27:39.125 --> 27:43.262
Didn't. I never understood that,

27:43.329 --> 27:45.264
Sean.

27:45.331 --> 27:54.940
[indistinct chattering]

27:55.008 --> 27:56.742
what's this?

27:56.810 --> 28:01.180
Ohh. Harvard.

28:01.247 --> 28:03.448
Congratulations. While you're

28:03.516 --> 28:05.017
Both freezing your balls off in

28:05.084 --> 28:06.518
The frigid northeast, I will be

28:06.586 --> 28:08.620
On the beach licking salt off of

28:08.688 --> 28:09.888
The hot bodies of my fellow

28:09.956 --> 28:12.724
Interns.

28:12.792 --> 28:14.226
I'll meet you after biochem.

28:14.294 --> 28:15.327
We still need to discuss

28:15.395 --> 28:21.533
Housing. See you, troy.

28:21.601 --> 28:23.235
guy's a fag.

28:23.303 --> 28:27.072
guy's a genius.

28:27.140 --> 28:27.940
so, you really want to go to

28:28.007 --> 28:28.740
School with a bunch of

28:28.808 --> 28:30.342
Overachieving grade-grubbers?

28:30.410 --> 28:31.410
as opposed to a bunch of

28:31.477 --> 28:33.178
Oversexed tit-grabbers?

28:33.246 --> 28:34.012
I just don't want to see you

28:34.080 --> 28:35.113
Turn into a grind. You have that

28:35.181 --> 28:38.984
Potential, buddy boy. Trust me.

28:39.052 --> 28:40.919
hey, um, there are direct

28:40.987 --> 28:42.287
Flights from miami to boston,

28:42.355 --> 28:43.856
You know?

28:43.923 --> 28:45.891
yeah. I just--I thought we

28:45.959 --> 28:47.259
Were going to be in this

28:47.327 --> 28:49.895
Together.

28:49.963 --> 28:50.863
So we going to do this thing

28:50.930 --> 28:53.899
Together or what? Come on.

28:53.967 --> 28:56.068
I got a surprise.

28:56.135 --> 29:03.609
[indistinct chattering]

29:03.676 --> 29:04.576
sure this is it?

29:04.644 --> 29:07.346
yes. Yes. I'm sure this is

29:07.413 --> 29:09.982
It. Oh, my god. Third floor,

29:10.049 --> 29:12.551
Room number 12. The original

29:12.619 --> 29:13.919
Home of mcnamara/troy. Can you

29:13.987 --> 29:15.854
Believe it? Look. It's been

29:15.922 --> 29:17.689
Painted a couple of times, and

29:17.757 --> 29:18.490
The cupboard used to be over

29:18.558 --> 29:19.625
There. The carpet's been

29:19.692 --> 29:20.425
Replaced.

29:20.493 --> 29:21.260
they didn't get rid of that

29:21.327 --> 29:22.127
Bong water stench.

29:22.195 --> 29:23.996
no, they didn't! Isn't that

29:24.063 --> 29:26.098
Great, huh? I love it! It's

29:26.165 --> 29:27.366
Great!

29:27.433 --> 29:28.467
you know how many hours we

29:28.534 --> 29:30.135
Spent studying in this room?

29:30.203 --> 29:32.204
ahh. Do you remember this

29:32.272 --> 29:34.206
Bed, huh? It's the first time I

29:34.274 --> 29:35.374
Ever had a threesome.

29:35.441 --> 29:38.010
I remember. I had midterms

29:38.077 --> 29:39.478
The next morning.

29:39.545 --> 29:41.413
[distant music and cheering]

29:41.481 --> 29:43.715
oh. Hold on.

29:43.783 --> 29:47.552
[grunts]

29:47.620 --> 29:48.854
Oh, my god.

29:48.922 --> 29:49.688
no.

29:49.756 --> 29:51.189
yeah. It's still here. It's

29:51.257 --> 29:52.457
Still here! Come and check it

29:52.525 --> 29:55.294
Out. The scoreboard!

29:55.361 --> 29:55.994
oh, the scoreboard!

29:56.062 --> 29:57.329
ahh! The scoreboard!

29:57.397 --> 29:58.463
[laughs]

29:58.531 --> 30:00.432
209 of miami's finest coeds

30:00.500 --> 30:02.100
Represented right here. Of

30:02.168 --> 30:03.735
Course, you know, if I banged

30:03.803 --> 30:04.603
Them at their place, I didn't

30:04.671 --> 30:05.671
Notch it down on there, so...

30:05.738 --> 30:06.471
yeah.

30:06.539 --> 30:07.272
there's a lot more.

30:07.340 --> 30:08.640
ok. Let's go grab some

30:08.708 --> 30:09.408
Dinner.

30:09.475 --> 30:10.642
go? What? What are you

30:10.710 --> 30:11.410
Talking about? We're sleeping

30:11.477 --> 30:13.145
Here tonight. I already paid

30:13.212 --> 30:15.347
The schlubs who room here so

30:15.415 --> 30:16.281
That we could stay.

30:16.349 --> 30:17.015
sleep here?

30:17.083 --> 30:18.850
yes, sleep here. Relive old

30:18.918 --> 30:20.385
Times, you know. Like, order

30:20.453 --> 30:22.187
Some pizza and drink some

30:22.255 --> 30:23.522
Scotch, get a little drunk,

30:23.589 --> 30:24.456
Right, like we did in senior

30:24.524 --> 30:27.459
Year. All right? Come on. We're

30:27.527 --> 30:28.393
Getting a big-ass award

30:28.461 --> 30:29.728
Tomorrow. We should at least

30:29.796 --> 30:30.662
Relive some of the good old

30:30.730 --> 30:31.496
Days, you know? The things that

30:31.564 --> 30:32.864
Kind of got us here. I mean--

30:32.932 --> 30:34.199
I don't know. Maybe you're

30:34.267 --> 30:37.869
Right. It could be fun.

30:37.937 --> 30:39.304
could be fun? I mean, come

30:39.372 --> 30:42.207
On! This is great, huh?

30:42.275 --> 30:42.874
mm.

30:42.942 --> 30:43.942
come on. Let's play darts.

30:44.010 --> 30:46.411
[chuckles]

30:46.479 --> 30:47.212
You're not going to fit in that

30:47.280 --> 30:49.081
Bed.

30:49.148 --> 30:50.415
[bubbling]

30:50.483 --> 30:51.350
you know, the showers still

30:51.417 --> 30:52.084
Have that--

30:52.151 --> 30:54.019
whoa, ho, ho. Hey, buddy boy.

30:54.087 --> 30:54.886
Look who I found while you were

30:54.954 --> 30:59.057
Taking a shower. Winona and

30:59.125 --> 31:02.894
Ryder. [laughs] [indistinct]

31:02.962 --> 31:03.829
Come on, man. We just started

31:03.896 --> 31:05.630
A game of strip poker. Here,

31:05.698 --> 31:08.834
Join us.

31:08.901 --> 31:11.703
[inhales and exhales]

31:11.771 --> 31:14.806
Oh, hold on, ladies. Yeah. You

31:14.874 --> 31:17.776
Know what that means? [laughs]

31:17.844 --> 31:19.678
Yeah, both of you, get going.

31:19.746 --> 31:20.912
[sighs]

31:20.980 --> 31:21.646
seanie, you enjoying

31:21.714 --> 31:24.249
Yourself? Partner? I think it's

31:24.317 --> 31:25.150
Your turn.

31:25.218 --> 31:26.651
[sighs] they're barely old

31:26.719 --> 31:27.786
Enough to have their driver's

31:27.854 --> 31:29.521
Licenses.

31:29.589 --> 31:32.024
they're 18. I carded them.

31:32.091 --> 31:35.894
I'm going for a walk.

31:35.962 --> 31:36.762
I thought he wanted to be

31:36.829 --> 31:38.597
More impulsive.

31:38.664 --> 31:41.266
[all laugh]

32:04.624 --> 32:05.590
I really didn't expect this

32:05.658 --> 32:07.592
Out of you, mr. Mcnamara.

32:07.660 --> 32:09.061
The entire semester, you've been

32:09.128 --> 32:10.762
A model student--an "a" on your

32:10.830 --> 32:11.930
Midterm, an "a" on your lab

32:11.998 --> 32:13.965
Work. Now, I wonder if you

32:14.033 --> 32:16.168
Cheated on them, too.

32:16.235 --> 32:17.269
just give me another chance,

32:17.336 --> 32:18.670
Professor silvestre. I'll do

32:18.738 --> 32:20.639
Anything. I know this stuff.

32:20.706 --> 32:21.473
Test me right now.

32:21.541 --> 32:22.374
ah, it's too late for that,

32:22.442 --> 32:23.108
Sean.

32:23.176 --> 32:23.942
but I'm supposed to go to

32:24.010 --> 32:24.709
Harvard in the fall. If you

32:24.777 --> 32:25.844
Flunk me, I won't get in. You

32:25.912 --> 32:26.745
Know that.

32:26.813 --> 32:27.446
you should have thought of

32:27.513 --> 32:28.480
That before you and mr. Troy

32:28.548 --> 32:30.482
Handed in the exact same final

32:30.550 --> 32:34.719
Papers. I'm failing both of you.

32:44.016 --> 32:46.117
mcnamara/troy has set new

Standards for reconstructive

Surgery, repeatedly doing

Before the poland award?

33:04.803 --> 33:05.536
dignity is overrated, my

33:05.603 --> 33:06.637
Friend. The freshmen, on

33:06.705 --> 33:08.038
The other hand, are not.

33:08.106 --> 33:09.973
ladies and gentlemen, it is

33:37.764 --> 33:39.064

33:39.132 --> 33:40.232
Receive this award. It's

33:40.300 --> 33:42.868
Really--[sighs] quite daunting.

33:51.578 --> 33:52.845
This man right here is the real

33:52.912 --> 33:54.179
Talent at mcnamara/troy

33:54.247 --> 33:57.616
And always has been. You are

33:57.684 --> 33:58.851
The man.

33:58.918 --> 34:00.853
[applause]

34:04.090 --> 34:07.893
[no audio]

34:07.961 --> 34:09.261
even when we were at school

34:09.329 --> 34:11.263
Here, every day and everybody

34:11.331 --> 34:12.531
Knew that sean was born to be

34:12.599 --> 34:14.032
A physician, and as I watched

34:14.100 --> 34:15.167
Him grow over the years and

34:15.235 --> 34:16.435
Become a master, I could only

34:16.503 --> 34:19.938
Hope that some of that

34:20.005 --> 34:22.306
Extraordinary talent would rub

34:22.375 --> 34:25.878
Off on me. [chuckles] not too

34:25.945 --> 34:27.379
Sure any of it has, but...

34:27.447 --> 34:28.614
[laughter]

34:28.681 --> 34:29.313
I guess, at the end of

34:29.382 --> 34:30.482
The day, my biggest contribution

34:30.550 --> 34:31.683
To our practice is letting

34:31.751 --> 34:35.587
The world in on his gifts and

34:35.655 --> 34:37.623
His talent. And I look forward

34:37.690 --> 34:39.391
To enjoying the view from his

34:39.458 --> 34:42.127
Coattails for many, many years

34:42.195 --> 34:43.295
To come.

34:43.362 --> 34:46.231
[applause]

34:46.299 --> 34:48.100
we are both humbled and

34:48.167 --> 34:50.536
Grateful for the jury's

34:50.603 --> 34:52.571
Selection, and we will strive

34:52.639 --> 34:54.907
To...

34:54.974 --> 34:57.843
Remain worthy of its honor, if

34:57.911 --> 35:02.047
We can. [laughs] thank you very

35:02.115 --> 35:02.781
Much.

35:02.849 --> 35:04.683
[applause]

35:04.751 --> 35:06.685
whoo!

35:13.092 --> 35:14.793
hey, dude. Look sharp.

35:14.861 --> 35:18.964
Someone's here to meet you.

35:19.032 --> 35:20.299
Julia noughton, meet

35:20.366 --> 35:22.834
Sean mcnamara, the best-looking,

35:22.902 --> 35:24.202
Smartest, most all-around

35:24.270 --> 35:26.104
Awesome guy on campus.

35:26.172 --> 35:28.440
wow. You certainly have

35:28.508 --> 35:30.842
A friend in christian, sean.

35:30.910 --> 35:32.444
it's very nice to meet you,

35:32.512 --> 35:35.414
Julia. Thanks for the kind

35:35.481 --> 35:36.615
Words, christian.

35:36.683 --> 35:37.683
just telling it like it is,

35:37.750 --> 35:39.985
Partner.

35:40.053 --> 35:41.987
[cheering and applause]

35:47.727 --> 35:49.461
thank you. Oh. Thank you so

35:49.529 --> 35:50.162
Much.

35:50.229 --> 35:50.862
it's unbelievable, huh?

35:50.930 --> 35:51.630
I know. What'd you think of

35:51.698 --> 35:52.531
The speech huh? I was a little

35:52.599 --> 35:53.365
Nervous, but...

35:53.433 --> 35:54.166
oh, it was something.

35:54.233 --> 35:55.767
so I didn't suck? Hey, thank

35:55.835 --> 35:56.969
You.

35:57.036 --> 35:59.004
all right. Congratulations.

35:59.072 --> 35:59.705
thanks very much.

35:59.772 --> 36:00.405
did you mean everything you

36:00.473 --> 36:01.239
Said?

36:01.307 --> 36:02.074
thank you. [chuckles]

36:02.141 --> 36:03.942
um, dr. Troy? Dr. Mcnamara?

36:04.010 --> 36:04.676
yes?

36:04.744 --> 36:05.444
can we get a picture

36:05.511 --> 36:06.211
Together?

36:06.279 --> 36:06.979
yeah.

36:07.046 --> 36:07.746
thank you.

36:07.814 --> 36:08.747
yeah. Of course.

36:08.815 --> 36:10.449
for the cover of the alumni

36:10.516 --> 36:11.183
Report.

36:11.250 --> 36:12.684
ahh, the cover. I like

36:12.752 --> 36:13.418
The sound of that.

36:13.486 --> 36:14.119
[laughs]

36:14.187 --> 36:14.920
can we get a couple of copies

36:14.988 --> 36:15.821
For the waiting room?

36:15.888 --> 36:16.855
are you kidding me? That's

36:16.923 --> 36:17.923
The least we can do.

36:17.991 --> 36:18.957
[chuckles]

36:19.025 --> 36:19.891
your donation was above and

36:19.959 --> 36:21.059
Beyond anything we ever

36:21.127 --> 36:21.960
Expected.

36:22.028 --> 36:22.728
what donation?

36:22.795 --> 36:23.762
yeah, especially this year,

36:23.830 --> 36:25.797
With the economy where it is.

36:25.865 --> 36:26.898
I'm just glad we had something

36:26.966 --> 36:28.000
To offer in return.

36:28.067 --> 36:30.402
well, this is fantastic.

36:30.470 --> 36:33.138
thank you. Both of you. Very

36:33.206 --> 36:33.872
Much.

36:33.940 --> 36:34.740
[chuckles]

36:34.807 --> 36:35.674
good to see you.

36:35.742 --> 36:36.341
thank you.

36:36.409 --> 36:37.009
you take care.

36:37.076 --> 36:38.410
ok.

36:38.478 --> 36:40.579
Yes. Oh. Thank you very much.

36:40.647 --> 36:41.513
thanks.

36:41.581 --> 36:43.315
thanks. Thank you, sir.

36:43.383 --> 36:44.049
how much did you give them?

36:44.117 --> 36:44.883
appreciate it. What's that?

36:44.951 --> 36:45.951
how much did you give them?

36:46.019 --> 36:46.752
a reasonable amount for

36:46.819 --> 36:48.620
A couple of--thank you so much--

36:48.688 --> 36:50.355
Successful surgeons--thank you.

36:50.423 --> 36:51.223
thank you.

36:51.290 --> 36:51.857
thank you.

36:51.924 --> 36:52.724
how much?

36:52.792 --> 36:53.725
thank you. Huh? What does it

36:53.793 --> 36:54.693
Matter? [clears throat]

36:54.761 --> 36:56.261
tell me how much.

36:56.329 --> 36:58.230
200. Thank you.

36:58.297 --> 36:59.064
thousand?

36:59.132 --> 37:00.432
yeah. It's tax-deductible.

37:00.500 --> 37:02.100
Thank you. [chuckles]

37:02.168 --> 37:03.602
you bought this.

37:03.670 --> 37:04.736
I guaranteed us another

37:04.804 --> 37:05.937
20 years in this business, my

37:06.005 --> 37:07.739
Friend. Thank you so much. Thank

37:07.807 --> 37:11.209
You. Untie your panties, ok?

37:11.277 --> 37:12.577
This was supposed to be

37:12.645 --> 37:13.779
Something to make you happy.

37:13.846 --> 37:14.746
oh, yeah. You're always

37:14.814 --> 37:15.647
Looking out for others, aren't

37:15.715 --> 37:17.082
You? Huh? How much did ryerson

37:17.150 --> 37:18.216
Donate?

37:18.284 --> 37:19.117
ryerson works with kids in

37:19.185 --> 37:20.485
Africa. He doesn't have any

37:20.553 --> 37:21.186
Money.

37:21.254 --> 37:22.654
just the dignity to let his

37:22.722 --> 37:24.022
Success earn him the honor.

37:24.090 --> 37:26.124
Not be forced to buy it. Which

37:26.192 --> 37:27.192
Makes this thing just a complete

37:27.260 --> 37:28.326
Joke and a waste of time, just

37:28.394 --> 37:30.328
Like everything with you.

37:33.166 --> 37:35.133
[chuckles]

37:41.674 --> 37:42.808
Sean, would you come back here,

37:42.875 --> 37:44.376
Please? Come on. You can't do

37:44.444 --> 37:45.210
This.

37:45.483 --> 37:46.783
watch me.

37:46.851 --> 37:47.551
all right. I should have told

37:47.618 --> 37:48.285
You.

37:48.352 --> 37:50.454
this is bullshit. I said you

37:50.521 --> 37:51.321
Could look at my notes, and you

37:51.389 --> 37:52.856
Copied my goddamn paper word for

37:52.924 --> 37:54.458
Word. You knew what was going to

37:54.525 --> 37:56.126
Happen. You know, I should have

37:56.194 --> 37:56.927
Known better. When you came into

37:56.994 --> 37:58.161
The library that day, I knew you

37:58.229 --> 37:58.929
Were trouble.

37:58.996 --> 38:00.330
I should have seen this coming.

38:00.398 --> 38:01.698
I should have known that getting

38:01.766 --> 38:03.467
The poland for plastic surgery

38:03.534 --> 38:04.434
Was a farce.

38:04.502 --> 38:06.403
it's not a farce. We did good

38:06.471 --> 38:07.404
Work, and we're being recognized

38:07.472 --> 38:08.739
For it. That's the truth.

38:08.806 --> 38:09.573
the truth is, you paid for

38:09.640 --> 38:11.775
It, and I should thank you

38:11.843 --> 38:12.743
Because you finally did

38:12.810 --> 38:14.778
Something so asinine that I can

38:14.846 --> 38:15.946
See what my problem's been all

38:16.013 --> 38:20.517
Along...Listening to you.

38:20.585 --> 38:21.718
oh, give me a break. Meeting

38:21.786 --> 38:22.786
Me is the best thing that's ever

38:22.854 --> 38:23.754
Going to happen to you, and I

38:23.821 --> 38:24.654
Think deep down inside, you know

38:24.722 --> 38:25.355
That.

38:25.423 --> 38:26.323
it's because of you I'm not

38:26.390 --> 38:27.624
Going to harvard.

38:27.692 --> 38:29.826
harvard is overrated, sean.

38:29.894 --> 38:32.996
you ruined my life.

38:33.064 --> 38:34.498
for god's sake, sean. Grow

38:34.565 --> 38:36.700
Up. The only one you have to

38:36.768 --> 38:43.473
Blame for your life is yourself.

38:43.541 --> 38:44.474
[elevator bell dings]

38:44.542 --> 39:44.467
[piano playing]

39:44.535 --> 39:47.037
you finished?

39:47.104 --> 39:50.207
with the hammer or with you?

39:50.274 --> 39:52.742
[inhales and exhales]

39:52.810 --> 39:57.447
I did it because...

39:57.515 --> 40:00.984
I don't know.

40:01.052 --> 40:05.188
[sighs]

40:05.256 --> 40:06.523
I wanted you to be happy about

40:06.591 --> 40:09.626
The work we've done.

40:09.694 --> 40:16.366
I want you to be happy with us.

40:16.434 --> 40:34.050
It's not all bad, sean.

40:34.118 --> 40:47.097
[wheels clacking]

40:47.164 --> 41:39.082
[grunting]

41:39.150 --> 41:40.617
sean. We have a problem.

Mr. Daly carved his face off.

41:46.724 --> 41:49.059
[monitor beeping]

41:49.126 --> 41:51.461
what an awful disease. Can

41:51.529 --> 41:52.495
You imagine doing this to

41:52.563 --> 41:58.969
Yourself, inflicting such pain?

41:59.036 --> 42:00.937
Just sutures? You're not going

42:01.005 --> 42:01.805
To fix him up?

42:01.872 --> 42:03.540
what's the point? He's just

42:03.607 --> 42:05.875
Going to do it again.

42:05.943 --> 42:06.743
you're just going to give up

42:06.811 --> 42:08.878
On him?

42:08.946 --> 42:10.080
big difference between giving

42:10.147 --> 42:11.448
Up and accepting someone for who

42:11.515 --> 42:12.449
They are.
