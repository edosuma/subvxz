00:01.305 --> 00:04.695
<i>College is like
one big, never-ending test.</i>

00:04.750 --> 00:06.525
<i>And not just for your brain...</i>

00:06.557 --> 00:08.493
<i>although sure, that's a part of it.</i>

00:08.525 --> 00:10.695
<i>We all need math, I guess.</i>

00:10.728 --> 00:13.241
<i>But it tests other things, too.</i>

00:13.266 --> 00:15.433
<i>Your character, your beliefs...</i>

00:15.466 --> 00:18.536
<i>and most of all? Your limits.</i>

00:18.570 --> 00:20.539
<i>Your blood-alcohol limit...</i>

00:20.571 --> 00:22.397
<i>Your sexual limits...</i>

00:22.444 --> 00:24.279
<i>Or lack thereof...</i>

00:24.313 --> 00:26.372
<i>Even your physical limits.</i>

00:26.397 --> 00:27.700
<i>And that night's rager...</i>

00:27.725 --> 00:29.723
<i>the biggest of Cal U's fall semester,</i>

00:29.748 --> 00:31.435
<i>"Faded 4 Finals"...</i>

00:31.468 --> 00:34.375
<i>promised to test all
of those limits and more.</i>

00:40.706 --> 00:42.575
It sucks that tomorrow morning

00:42.608 --> 00:45.644
I have to take
the very last final on campus...

00:45.678 --> 00:47.347
Chemistry 101.

00:47.372 --> 00:49.433
<i>But</i> I have a 3-pronged plan

00:49.465 --> 00:52.602
to make sure I stay safely
within my limits for the night.

00:54.305 --> 00:56.207
Timer.

00:56.239 --> 00:58.441
Breathalyzer.

00:58.474 --> 01:00.543
<i>Agua.</i>

01:00.577 --> 01:03.447
So I'm gonna be here
for 10 minutes, go hard,

01:03.480 --> 01:05.416
then literally go home.

01:05.449 --> 01:06.450
Boom.

01:06.483 --> 01:10.288
Clear plan, full cup, can't lose.

01:10.321 --> 01:12.590
All right, I better make
the next 10 minutes

01:12.622 --> 01:14.624
the best of my college career.

01:14.658 --> 01:17.727
Oh, nine. Got to go.

01:17.760 --> 01:21.565

01:51.527 --> 01:55.432
All right, the party clock
has been reset.

01:55.465 --> 01:57.500
10 minutes. Let's do this.

01:57.533 --> 01:59.536
You realize this is the littiest party

01:59.569 --> 02:00.670
of the semester, right?

02:00.703 --> 02:02.605
You realize 10 minutes
could never be enough

02:02.638 --> 02:05.308
to witness the exquisite debauchery?

02:05.342 --> 02:06.510
You <i> realize</i> Mr. Dalvin of Jodeci

02:06.542 --> 02:07.991
is rumored to be stopping in, right?

02:08.015 --> 02:09.378
You realize people can actually hear

02:09.412 --> 02:10.613
the stuff that comes out your mouth?

02:10.646 --> 02:12.350
Uh, yeah, and
as much as I'd love to meet

02:12.382 --> 02:15.719
the dude from the group who
inspired #WashedUpWednesdays,

02:15.753 --> 02:18.456
my Chem 101 final is tomorrow morning.

02:18.488 --> 02:20.623
Zoey, my average-looking yet
overly diligent friend.

02:20.656 --> 02:22.493
- I'm stunning.
- Unless you're a total moron,

02:22.525 --> 02:24.528
you could legit never open
any kind of book ever

02:24.560 --> 02:26.397
and still crack a B-minus, no cap.

02:26.429 --> 02:30.634
Well, if Vivek of all people
says the test is easy,

02:30.666 --> 02:32.669
I might actually be okay.

02:32.702 --> 02:33.737
Okay, y'all, shots.

02:33.771 --> 02:35.806
Come on. Squad up. Let's go.

02:35.838 --> 02:37.807
Yo, but where are Ana and Nomi?

02:37.840 --> 02:39.642
Good question.

02:39.676 --> 02:41.712
Lemme text these hoes.

02:48.785 --> 02:51.588
How is it midnight already?!

02:51.622 --> 02:53.757
I guess time flies
when you've been transported

02:53.791 --> 02:56.560
to the land of pure, sensual pleasure.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.495
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

02:58.529 --> 03:00.120
Then why did it fly this time?

03:00.763 --> 03:02.565
Come on, man.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.535
What?

03:04.568 --> 03:06.570
- What? What?
- Nothing.

03:12.542 --> 03:15.677
So, I want to watch Roxane Gay
talk about anything

03:15.711 --> 03:16.846
for the rest of my life, always.

03:16.878 --> 03:18.881
Everything you have
taken me to this week

03:18.914 --> 03:20.782
has been amazing.

03:20.816 --> 03:23.520
Thank you so much.

03:23.552 --> 03:24.787
Anytime.

03:25.888 --> 03:28.525
Sorry. One second.

03:31.727 --> 03:34.497
- Anything important?
- No. It's Zoey.

03:34.530 --> 03:36.279
She's, um, at the rager of the year

03:36.311 --> 03:37.413
and wants me to meet her there.

03:37.445 --> 03:38.546
Well, go have fun.

03:38.578 --> 03:40.415
I don't have to go.

03:40.447 --> 03:41.448
Not right now, anyway.

03:41.482 --> 03:46.354
We could hang out
for a little bit longer.

03:46.387 --> 03:48.589
I-I mean, I'd like that.

03:48.621 --> 03:49.791
But that would be selfish,

03:49.823 --> 03:53.428
and you shouldn't stop
doing stuff with your friends

03:53.460 --> 03:54.695
just to hang out with me.

03:54.727 --> 03:57.464
Yeah, but...

03:57.498 --> 03:58.632
what if I want to?

03:59.833 --> 04:02.602
Nomi...

04:02.636 --> 04:04.772
these are the best four years
you're ever gonna get.

04:04.804 --> 04:06.740
You're here to experience life,

04:06.774 --> 04:09.644
not just talk about it in a classroom.

04:09.677 --> 04:11.712
Go do it.

04:11.744 --> 04:13.713
Okay, fine. Twist my arm,
I'm gonna go party.

04:13.746 --> 04:15.482
I'm gonna have an amazing time...

04:15.516 --> 04:17.483
and I will be texting you after.

04:17.517 --> 04:18.653
All right.

04:24.525 --> 04:25.760
Never mind.

04:27.000 --> 04:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:35.503 --> 04:37.405
Okay, so, technically,

04:37.437 --> 04:38.805
I've been waiting
for the alcohol to arrive,

04:38.838 --> 04:41.408
so this shouldn't count
towards my "fun time."

04:41.441 --> 04:43.910
So, restarted my party clock
just to make up

04:43.944 --> 04:46.646
for those potential precious
minutes of lost youth.

04:46.679 --> 04:48.482
- Oh, oh?
- Uh, heads-up,

04:48.516 --> 04:49.850
I think my boy Doug
is coming through tonight.

04:49.883 --> 04:51.785
Does this outfit
look like I give a damn?

04:51.819 --> 04:53.588
- It does not.
- No.

04:53.621 --> 04:54.822
She <i> does,</i> though.

04:54.855 --> 04:56.456
Her and Doug haven't talked ever since

04:56.489 --> 04:58.658
our whole rebranding
of our IG went down.

04:58.691 --> 05:00.660
- No contact for weeks.
- What? For real?

05:00.694 --> 05:02.662
- Zero.
- Aw.

05:02.696 --> 05:06.600
Hey, don't "aw" me.
I am not checking for Doug.

05:06.633 --> 05:07.701
Hey... y'all let me know
if you want some more shots,

05:07.734 --> 05:09.670
because your boy's got V.I.P. access,

05:09.703 --> 05:11.606
so I. Got. Chu.

05:11.638 --> 05:14.475
We tried to tell him.

05:14.508 --> 05:16.511
Vivek, this is a college party.

05:16.544 --> 05:19.514
There is no such thing
as a V.I.P. section.

05:19.547 --> 05:20.681
You got played.

05:20.713 --> 05:22.682
Okay, I'm sure my boy Jahi made up

05:22.715 --> 05:24.951
a fake V.I.P. section
with bottle service

05:24.984 --> 05:27.554
<i>and</i> a meet-and-greet
with Jodeci's Mr. Dalvin

05:27.588 --> 05:28.855
all for a cool hundo.

05:28.888 --> 05:30.525
Okay.

05:30.557 --> 05:31.825
A toast... to Vivek

05:31.859 --> 05:33.494
and asking more questions,

05:33.527 --> 05:35.496
both of which are painfully basic.

05:35.528 --> 05:36.831
- Mm.
- Yeah, cheers.

05:38.831 --> 05:41.501
To paraphrase Beyoncé's husband...

05:41.535 --> 05:44.672
after the party is
the dorm-room lobby, which is...

05:44.705 --> 05:47.146
where I'm headed for
a three-hour block of studying.

05:50.710 --> 05:53.013
No, no, no, no, no.
But this is my song, though.

05:53.038 --> 05:55.749
I can't leave now. So for every
10 minutes of partying,

05:55.783 --> 05:57.718
I'll do an extra 10 minutes of studying.

05:57.751 --> 06:00.821
Solid math. All right, let's go.

06:35.622 --> 06:37.958
I'll get the drinks.

06:41.961 --> 06:44.764
Oh, wait, Ana!

06:44.797 --> 06:45.932
Ana!

06:45.965 --> 06:48.768
Ana, hi!

06:50.604 --> 06:52.640
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:52.672 --> 06:54.542
I thought you would be studying.

06:54.574 --> 06:56.776
Oh, no, Vivek said the test
was, like, super easy,

06:56.809 --> 06:57.911
so I'm just hanging out for a bit,

06:57.944 --> 06:59.045
letting my brain relax

06:59.078 --> 07:01.648
so I can really absorb the info.

07:01.682 --> 07:03.551
- Yeah. Totally.
- Now that I think about it,

07:03.583 --> 07:04.718
I haven't seen Nomi.

07:04.751 --> 07:06.754
Or Aaron, for that matter.
Have you seen him?

07:06.787 --> 07:08.022
Why would I? I hate him.

07:08.054 --> 07:09.956
Okay, I thought
you guys were, like, cool now.

07:09.989 --> 07:13.660
- Nope. Nope, he sucks.
- Cool.

07:13.694 --> 07:15.629
- Ooh.
- Oh, sorry. Hi.

07:15.662 --> 07:17.597
- Aaron, hey.
- Thank you so much

07:17.631 --> 07:19.934
for the two drinks for Zoey and I.

07:19.967 --> 07:21.736
Turns out he doesn't suck.

07:23.670 --> 07:24.904
Thanks?

07:26.773 --> 07:28.643
No, I'm sorry. I'm just
resetting my timer.

07:28.675 --> 07:29.776
For what?

07:29.809 --> 07:31.911
It's a reminder to study
for my Chem final.

07:31.944 --> 07:33.613
I'm only gonna stay for like 10 minutes,

07:33.646 --> 07:34.682
like, 40, tops.

07:34.715 --> 07:36.017
You're in Mr. Woolery's class, right?

07:36.049 --> 07:37.585
Yeah.

07:37.617 --> 07:38.819
I remember taking
that test freshman year.

07:38.852 --> 07:39.987
I'm still traumatized.

07:40.020 --> 07:42.657
But Vivek said it was, like, super easy.

07:42.689 --> 07:44.958
Yeah, but, I mean, you do
realize Vivek's a genius, right?

07:44.992 --> 07:46.826
The dude's an engineering major
and a drug dealer, okay...

07:46.859 --> 07:48.763
basically all the ingredients
of a chemist.

07:48.795 --> 07:50.630
No wonder he aced the test
without breaking a sweat.

07:50.663 --> 07:51.931
But you, my homey,

07:51.965 --> 07:53.271
you're [bleep].

08:02.141 --> 08:05.779
<i>The thing about limits is you
can push them for a while,</i>

08:05.812 --> 08:09.115
<i>but at a certain point, they
might start pushing you back.</i>

08:09.148 --> 08:10.884
Whoo!

08:10.917 --> 08:13.821
J. Cole sucks! Yeah! Whoo!

08:15.855 --> 08:18.725
Aaron's words have really sobered me.

08:18.758 --> 08:20.263
Not in the traditional sense...

08:20.288 --> 08:22.535
'cause... I'm <i> faded...</i>

08:22.560 --> 08:25.254
but in the sense
that I'm making an early exit

08:25.279 --> 08:26.701
from the party of the semester

08:26.734 --> 08:28.903
to do what I should've done
an hour ago...

08:28.936 --> 08:31.037
go back to my room and study.

08:31.071 --> 08:33.039
You know what?
Okay, fine, you caught me.

08:33.072 --> 08:34.808
<i>Hours</i> ago.

08:34.841 --> 08:37.077
Alcohol really does dull your judgment.

08:37.110 --> 08:39.746
That's chemistry, right?

08:39.779 --> 08:42.148
Dammit. I have no idea.
I really gotta go.

08:42.182 --> 08:45.152
Gotta go. I'm going. That way.

08:45.185 --> 08:46.821
I'm going that way.

08:54.927 --> 08:56.996
My key card. Oh!

08:57.029 --> 08:58.832
Hi. Excuse me.

08:58.865 --> 09:00.900
Uh, can... can one of you let me in?

09:00.933 --> 09:03.036
I-I got locked out. Please?

09:03.070 --> 09:04.071
I-I live right upstairs.

09:04.104 --> 09:06.107
I promise I'm not a serial killer.

09:16.883 --> 09:18.682
Zoey. Zoey.

09:18.707 --> 09:19.754
I need you.

09:19.787 --> 09:21.088
- Jazz won't listen to me.
- I actually really...

09:21.120 --> 09:23.790
I have never asked you
for anything before

09:23.824 --> 09:26.794
in my entire life, and I
probably won't ever do it again.

09:26.826 --> 09:28.862
So are you really gonna
miss out on this opportunity?

09:28.896 --> 09:30.150
- No, I'm not.
- You're not. Let's go.

09:30.175 --> 09:31.932
And he thought he could tell <i> me</i>

09:31.965 --> 09:34.734
what I could and couldn't
post on my socials

09:34.768 --> 09:36.870
when his are just a whole-ass mess,

09:36.903 --> 09:39.773
when his ratios are just sad to look at,

09:39.807 --> 09:42.777
when his are just pictures
of his wack-ass tennis shoes

09:42.810 --> 09:45.746
and a blurry selfie
with his wack-ass mama.

09:45.778 --> 09:47.081
Oh, my G... is she on IG Live?

09:47.114 --> 09:50.117
Yes, she's having
a full-on meltdown live.

09:50.149 --> 09:51.951
All right, um...

09:51.984 --> 09:53.787
Hey, Jazz.

09:53.821 --> 09:54.989
Jazz, baby girl, you want to talk to me.

09:55.022 --> 09:56.123
- What's going on?
- Hold on.

09:56.157 --> 09:59.727
And then dude had the nerve
to come up to this party,

09:59.759 --> 10:02.061
where I am, and <i> dance,</i> knowing damn well

10:02.095 --> 10:04.165
he don't know how to dance.
Are you joking?

10:05.932 --> 10:07.902
- Is he joking?!
- I bet he is,

10:07.935 --> 10:09.804
'cause Doug is such a joker.

10:09.836 --> 10:11.771
He loves a good joke, and so does Jazz,

10:11.805 --> 10:14.975
- because this is a joke, everybody.
- Unh-unh-unh-unh-unh.

10:15.008 --> 10:17.143
Best believe I got
those screenshots for days.

10:17.177 --> 10:18.178
For <i> days.</i>

10:18.211 --> 10:20.080
Your ass is gonna be nothing again.

10:20.113 --> 10:21.081
Yes.

10:21.114 --> 10:22.783
Hey.

10:25.185 --> 10:28.255
Did you... just touch...

10:28.287 --> 10:29.923
my phone?

10:29.956 --> 10:31.758
Yes, I did,

10:31.792 --> 10:33.093
but in my defense,

10:33.125 --> 10:36.029
not only is that social-media suicide...

10:36.062 --> 10:37.667
You know what, don't look
at him. Don't look at him.

10:37.692 --> 10:39.800
It's just a bad move for a girlfriend.

10:39.832 --> 10:41.768
- I'm not his girlfriend.
- Ex-girlfriend.

10:41.802 --> 10:44.004
- We're <i> not</i> broken up!
- This is getting worse,

10:44.037 --> 10:45.840
not better. Fix it.

10:45.873 --> 10:47.174
You know what? Look.

10:47.206 --> 10:50.009
Look, I get that it's difficult

10:50.042 --> 10:51.879
and complicated between you two,

10:51.912 --> 10:54.114
but the one thing I really
admire about you

10:54.147 --> 10:55.950
is that you're brave. You're brave.

10:55.983 --> 10:57.184
You know how to confront things.

10:57.216 --> 10:59.787
And what I know for a fact

10:59.820 --> 11:02.189
is that you will find a way
to confront the situation

11:02.221 --> 11:05.157
- between the two of you.
- Yes. Mm-hmm. Yes, I will.

11:05.191 --> 11:07.827
- You got this. You got this.
- Yes, I got this. I got this.

11:07.860 --> 11:09.345
You are Jazz, and you've got everything.

11:09.370 --> 11:10.556
- Yes.
- She's got this. Tell her she's got this.

11:10.581 --> 11:12.361
- She's got this.
- You got this, Jazz.

11:12.386 --> 11:14.968
- Aw, you're such a good friend.
- Oh, I know.

11:16.235 --> 11:20.840
Why is being the glue of
this group so time-consuming?

11:20.874 --> 11:22.843
And, God, where is Ana?

11:22.875 --> 11:25.178
All I can think about
is being naked with you...

11:25.211 --> 11:27.047
I can't stop.

11:27.080 --> 11:28.315
Get out of here.

11:28.348 --> 11:32.152
Ana, I really need
your key card so I can study.

11:32.185 --> 11:34.154
Oh, yeah. Key?

11:34.186 --> 11:36.856
- Oh.
- Oh, my God. Thank you.

11:36.889 --> 11:38.225
And, by the way,
it's so nice that you two

11:38.258 --> 11:40.754
are finally hanging out
like normal people.

11:40.779 --> 11:41.995
No, we're not normal.

11:42.028 --> 11:43.831
He's super weird and ugly.

11:46.365 --> 11:47.623
Ugly?

11:50.037 --> 11:51.906
- Wha... Aar...
- Come on, man.

11:57.277 --> 11:58.946
Ayo, I ordered a bottle an hour ago.

11:58.979 --> 12:01.181
What kind of elevated
experience is this?

12:01.214 --> 12:02.316
I'm calling Jahi.

12:05.052 --> 12:07.086
Finally.

12:07.119 --> 12:09.188
I got some water,

12:09.221 --> 12:12.091
got some aromatherapy
to get my mind right,

12:12.124 --> 12:16.029
and now it's time to get my study on.

12:16.062 --> 12:16.963
Hm.

12:18.297 --> 12:21.067
You're home! I thought you'd
still be down at the party.

12:21.100 --> 12:24.237
Nope. Still here, learning.

12:24.271 --> 12:26.040
Sucks for you, nerd.

12:26.072 --> 12:27.273
Meanwhile,

12:27.307 --> 12:30.277
I have fallen <i> deeply</i> in like.

12:30.310 --> 12:33.147
Like, "I definitely am gonna
text her tomorrow morning,

12:33.180 --> 12:35.282
and we haven't even hooked up
yet" kind of like.

12:38.085 --> 12:40.387
<i>Nomi</i> deeply in like?

12:40.419 --> 12:44.290
I mean, this is huge for her.

12:44.324 --> 12:47.227
She's gonna want to talk about it.

12:47.259 --> 12:49.095
Hey, you want to talk about it?

12:49.129 --> 12:50.297
No, I don't want to jinx it.

12:50.330 --> 12:51.297
Yes.

12:51.331 --> 12:52.966
But I do wanna party about it.

12:52.999 --> 12:54.268
- Come on.
- No.

12:54.301 --> 12:56.235
As much as I'd love to, I can't.

12:56.268 --> 12:58.071
It's 2:00 a.m., girly,

12:58.105 --> 13:01.108
and my Chem final's
tomorrow morning in...

13:02.975 --> 13:04.077
...seven hours.

13:04.110 --> 13:06.145
- All right,<i> chemistry,</i> Zoey?
- Mm-hmm.

13:06.178 --> 13:08.081
You are a fashion major.

13:08.114 --> 13:10.183
Unless you're doing, like,
big things with lab coats

13:10.216 --> 13:11.951
and, I don't know, goggles,

13:11.984 --> 13:13.086
don't need chemistry.

13:13.119 --> 13:14.321
I still need a good grade. Remember?

13:14.354 --> 13:17.191
I dropped my design lab.
I can't fail this class

13:17.224 --> 13:20.413
unless I want an incomplete
on the entire semester.

13:20.438 --> 13:21.539
First of all,

13:21.573 --> 13:25.145
I bet that you absorbed like
90% of what you need to know

13:25.178 --> 13:26.312
just through osmosis alone.

13:26.345 --> 13:28.414
- What?
- Not important.

13:28.447 --> 13:30.350
Second of all, what I'm hearing

13:30.382 --> 13:31.517
is that you need a <i> passing</i> grade.

13:31.550 --> 13:33.285
Not a good one. Very different.

13:33.318 --> 13:35.521
My GPA will know the difference.

13:35.554 --> 13:37.189
- GPA, Zoey?
- Yes.

13:37.222 --> 13:38.591
You are an <i> artiste,</i> okay?

13:38.624 --> 13:42.428
You don't need a 4.0.
You need to experience life.

13:42.461 --> 13:44.197
I mean, now that you mention it,

13:44.230 --> 13:46.466
Grace Coddington didn't
even go to college.

13:46.499 --> 13:50.336
And she's the visionary
behind Anna Wintour's <i> Vogue.</i>

13:50.369 --> 13:51.437
Yes.<i> Vogue.</i>

13:51.470 --> 13:55.608
Look, a very good friend of mine
helped me realize

13:55.640 --> 13:59.973
that this place, it's about
more than just academics.

13:59.998 --> 14:02.314
These are four of the most amazing years

14:02.347 --> 14:04.217
we are ever going to get.

14:04.250 --> 14:05.518
We need to live them.

14:05.550 --> 14:07.253
Yes.

14:08.254 --> 14:10.490
I <i> am</i> Grace Coddington.

14:13.326 --> 14:15.328
You know what? Nomi is right.

14:15.361 --> 14:17.297
School is about so much
more than just...

14:17.329 --> 14:18.363
school.

14:18.396 --> 14:21.501
It's about friends and love and parties.

14:21.534 --> 14:24.337
And so, in honor of all of those things,

14:24.370 --> 14:26.371
let's get our osmosis on!

14:26.404 --> 14:28.174
Not what it means.

14:28.207 --> 14:29.609
I'll get there.

14:40.519 --> 14:42.654
You know what? I got this.

14:42.688 --> 14:45.225
Like, sure, I didn't get home
until 7:00 a.m.,

14:45.257 --> 14:48.493
but I'm really crisp. And Nomi is right.

14:48.526 --> 14:50.529
I may not be a chemist, per se,

14:50.563 --> 14:52.564
but ya girl looked up
what "osmosis" meant

14:52.597 --> 14:54.500
before I puked in a bush.

14:54.533 --> 14:57.337
It's all up here.
Just trust in the process.

14:57.370 --> 15:00.440
And I got to go to a cool party,
so win-win.

15:02.574 --> 15:04.409
<i>Question one:</i>

15:04.443 --> 15:06.545
<i>"What is the chemical
formula for water?"</i>

15:08.213 --> 15:11.583
<i>Uh, that'd be "H" to the "O."</i>

15:11.616 --> 15:15.221
<i>OMG. I am great at chemistry.</i>

15:15.254 --> 15:17.356
<i>I am a chemist.</i>

15:17.390 --> 15:19.424
<i>All right, question number two:</i>

15:19.457 --> 15:23.630
<i>"Calculate the molar solubility
of calcium hydroxide."</i>

15:23.663 --> 15:26.432
<i>Okay, that one's a little bit
of a thinker.</i>

15:26.464 --> 15:29.268
<i>I'll come back to it.</i>

15:43.515 --> 15:47.286
<i>"Enzyme catalyzed reaction"?</i>

15:47.319 --> 15:48.554
<i>You know this, Zoey.</i>

15:48.587 --> 15:51.390
<i>Enzyme catalogue reactors.</i>

15:51.424 --> 15:54.327
<i>Damn it. Maybe I should go back
to question two.</i>

15:54.360 --> 15:56.629
10 minutes left, and remember, people,

15:56.661 --> 15:58.397
check your answers.

15:58.430 --> 16:01.400
This test is worth 50% of your grade.

16:01.433 --> 16:03.669
10 minutes? Oh, my God.

16:03.703 --> 16:05.505
I thought at the very least, I'd pull,

16:05.538 --> 16:07.307
like, a-a "D" -minus.

16:07.339 --> 16:09.574
But if I fail this test,
then I fail the whole class.

16:09.607 --> 16:11.743
I-I'm gonna be put on
academic probation.

16:13.679 --> 16:17.650
<i>So, there I was, an entire
evening of making bad decisions</i>

16:17.683 --> 16:21.453
<i>had pushed me to the point
of making one more.</i>

16:24.356 --> 16:25.424
Oh, my God.

16:25.457 --> 16:27.427
I'm so sorry, but my pencil dropped.

16:27.459 --> 16:28.527
Would you mind grabbing it for me?

16:34.500 --> 16:35.601
Thank you.

16:55.321 --> 16:57.623
Okay.

16:57.655 --> 16:58.790
Come in, why don't you?

16:58.823 --> 17:00.692
I don't like formalities either.

17:00.726 --> 17:03.362
I want to tell Zoey.

17:03.396 --> 17:04.497
- About what?
- About...

17:06.431 --> 17:08.333
...this.

17:08.367 --> 17:10.336
Oh, oh. Okay.

17:10.368 --> 17:12.804
Yeah, I mean, I just thought
you didn't want to do that

17:12.838 --> 17:14.707
'cause it would mess up
the energy of the crew, and...

17:14.739 --> 17:18.377
Maybe, but I feel guilty,
like, all the time.

17:18.410 --> 17:20.712
So, yes, maybe saying something
might affect the squad,

17:20.746 --> 17:21.747
but not saying anything?

17:21.781 --> 17:25.550
I-I-It's totally affecting me, so...

17:25.583 --> 17:26.752
I have to. I have to tell her.

17:26.785 --> 17:28.587
I respect that.

17:28.621 --> 17:31.424
You know, do what you got to do.

17:32.725 --> 17:35.495
Oh.

17:35.527 --> 17:37.662
Okay.

17:37.696 --> 17:39.599
- Good talk.
- We did it.

17:53.260 --> 17:54.695
Hello, Douglas.

17:54.729 --> 17:57.231
Ah.

17:57.265 --> 17:58.432
Good afternoon, Jazlyn.

17:58.466 --> 18:00.302
Look, I just want you to know

18:00.335 --> 18:02.537
I'm gonna forgive your little
pettiness last night.

18:02.569 --> 18:06.474
So can we just stop with
the bullshit and move forward?

18:06.508 --> 18:09.443
It depends. Is the first step
of moving forward

18:09.477 --> 18:12.281
you taking down that
rebranding shit on Instagram?

18:12.314 --> 18:14.416
Um, it is not.

18:14.449 --> 18:17.585
All right.
So there's nothing to discuss.

18:17.618 --> 18:18.720
That's not the look for me.

18:18.752 --> 18:21.622
I don't care what your look is.

18:21.655 --> 18:24.625
- All right, bet.
- Let me just be clear.

18:24.659 --> 18:26.261
When I met you,

18:26.294 --> 18:28.229
I was looking for a boyfriend,

18:28.262 --> 18:29.497
not a second dad.

18:29.530 --> 18:31.299
Okay, and when I met you,

18:31.333 --> 18:32.734
I was looking for a girlfriend,

18:32.767 --> 18:35.304
not some little Instagram shorty

18:35.336 --> 18:37.306
that's setting thirst traps.

18:37.338 --> 18:39.508
Well, um,

18:39.540 --> 18:42.644
I guess this isn't anything
a discussion is going to fix.

18:43.711 --> 18:45.346
No, I guess not.

18:45.380 --> 18:47.383
Or any amount of time apart.

18:48.650 --> 18:49.685
Nah.

18:51.553 --> 18:54.356
I guess we could call it a wrap.

18:54.389 --> 18:55.524
Might as well make it official.

18:55.556 --> 18:56.692
- Might as well.
- Cool.

18:56.717 --> 18:57.896
- Yeah.
- Yep.

19:04.399 --> 19:06.635
Seriously? I mean, how long can it take

19:06.668 --> 19:09.070
to hand out 40 "C" -minuses?

19:11.573 --> 19:12.674
Yes?

19:12.707 --> 19:14.241
Hey.

19:14.266 --> 19:15.344
Oh, hey.

19:15.376 --> 19:16.478
You busy?

19:16.510 --> 19:17.678
No, just waiting for grades.

19:17.711 --> 19:19.513
Uh, what's up?

19:19.547 --> 19:21.350
Uh, nothing. I just...

19:21.383 --> 19:22.683
I wanted to talk to you about something,

19:22.717 --> 19:25.320
something I've been thinking about.

19:25.353 --> 19:26.688
Everything okay?

19:26.720 --> 19:28.457
Yeah.

19:28.489 --> 19:29.490
Uh...

19:31.393 --> 19:33.528
- Zoey.
- Yeah?

19:33.560 --> 19:36.564
Have you ever done something
that's not terrible,

19:36.597 --> 19:39.401
but it's not great?

19:39.433 --> 19:41.670
Um, I'm so s... I'm sorry.

19:41.702 --> 19:42.738
Sorry, sorry.

19:47.575 --> 19:49.745
No.

19:49.778 --> 19:52.514
Are you okay?

19:52.547 --> 19:54.415
No, um,

19:54.449 --> 19:57.518
I think I might've just gotten
caught cheating, so...

19:59.453 --> 20:01.456
Yeah.

20:03.791 --> 20:05.693
I am so sorry this V.I.P. thing

20:05.727 --> 20:07.729
didn't work out for you, dude, honestly.

20:07.761 --> 20:09.730
But when you think about it,
it's entirely your fault.

20:09.764 --> 20:13.702
Like, you had control of
the situation the whole time.

20:13.735 --> 20:15.570
Could've got out at any moment,
but you didn't,

20:15.603 --> 20:18.606
so there's that.

20:18.640 --> 20:19.841
Thanks, man.

20:19.874 --> 20:22.443
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm going for a walk.

20:22.477 --> 20:23.678
All right.

20:32.554 --> 20:33.622
What the...?

20:38.559 --> 20:39.760
It's... It's real.

20:42.663 --> 20:45.366
Aaron, "A" -plus, come here.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.536
It's... It's real.

20:47.568 --> 20:49.370
Mr. Dalvin?

20:49.403 --> 20:51.406
From Jodeci?
