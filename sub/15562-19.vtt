WEBVTT

00:01.623 --> 00:05.610
So, Bo, what makes you interested
in a career at Cloud 9?

00:05.623 --> 00:06.556
Money.

00:06.624 --> 00:08.658
Oh, sure, sure... money.

00:08.726 --> 00:10.293
We've got the baby, and, you know,

00:10.394 --> 00:13.563
we're saving up for a wedding,
and it's really expensive.

00:13.631 --> 00:15.865
- Our theme is "Sick as Hell."
- Oh.

00:15.933 --> 00:17.667
Or maybe it's gonna be "Dope as Ass."

00:17.735 --> 00:19.135
We're still kinda deciding on that,

00:19.203 --> 00:21.668
- you know what I'm saying? But together.
- Aww.

00:21.716 --> 00:24.903
Okay, well, why don't you tell me a
little bit about your work experience?

00:24.966 --> 00:26.900
On your application, you said, uh,

00:26.968 --> 00:29.103
"DJ, player's player,"

00:29.204 --> 00:31.339
and you drew a picture of a skateboard.

00:31.370 --> 00:33.507
Yeah, that's my tag. It's what up.

00:33.575 --> 00:36.076
Bo doesn't have a lot
of work experience,

00:36.144 --> 00:38.412
- but he's a great dad...
- Yeah.

00:38.480 --> 00:39.964
And he's good with people.

00:39.965 --> 00:42.683
Yo, and I roll the fattest Js, so...

00:42.751 --> 00:46.163
Okay, uh, where do you see
yourself in the future?

00:46.164 --> 00:47.855
Future... okay. So for real,

00:47.956 --> 00:49.523
I've given this actually,
like, a lot of thought.

00:49.591 --> 00:51.125
It's like, there's no government,

00:51.192 --> 00:53.193
there's no laws, and
I'm the head of, like,

00:53.261 --> 00:55.329
this roving murder gang kinda thing,

00:55.397 --> 00:57.364
but my best friend is a robot.

00:57.432 --> 01:02.469
He means... where do you see
yourself at Cloud 9?

01:02.570 --> 01:04.337
Oh... yo, I'm not in this

01:04.406 --> 01:05.806
for long term at all,
you know what I'm saying?

01:05.874 --> 01:07.641
I'm just here to make
some paper, then bounce.

01:07.709 --> 01:08.776
Yo, but don't tell that

01:08.843 --> 01:10.734
to the bozos in charge of hiring.

01:10.852 --> 01:13.049
Um, Glenn is in charge of hiring.

01:13.601 --> 01:14.448
Oh, cool, okay.

01:14.450 --> 01:16.157
Yeah, I'm here for a long time, so...

01:17.165 --> 01:19.798
S02E09 - Spring Cleaning
Synced and corrected by hawken45

01:19.818 --> 01:21.088
for www.addic7ed.com

01:21.156 --> 01:24.058
Okay, let's give a
warm first-day welcome

01:24.159 --> 01:26.660
to our newest employee, Bo Thompson...

01:26.728 --> 01:28.562
What's up?

01:28.630 --> 01:31.799
Who apparently wasn't
filled in about the dress code.

01:31.866 --> 01:34.034
Why does his middle
finger look so weird?

01:34.102 --> 01:36.637
Oh, it's a penis. Ha, clever.

01:36.704 --> 01:38.705
Bo, maybe you should change.

01:38.773 --> 01:39.673
Change into what?

01:39.737 --> 01:41.241
Where am I supposed to
find another shirt?

01:41.243 --> 01:42.677
We work in a store.

01:42.844 --> 01:44.278
Okay, moving on.

01:44.345 --> 01:47.648
Uh, today, we're gonna
be spring cleaning,

01:47.715 --> 01:50.350
which is gonna be buckets of fun.

01:53.688 --> 01:55.255
What? That's... that was funny.

01:55.323 --> 01:56.137
No, it wasn't.

01:56.139 --> 01:58.427
Literally nobody
laughed, except for you.

01:58.493 --> 01:59.297
It's barely even wordplay.

01:59.298 --> 02:01.361
He just said buckets,
and held up a bucket.

02:01.429 --> 02:03.481
It's called prop comedy, Dina.

02:03.631 --> 02:05.693
You're just kissing up to him,
'cause you're dating his daughter.

02:05.694 --> 02:08.202
That's not true at all.
In fact, just this morning,

02:08.269 --> 02:10.572
Kristen said she respects
how much I don't kiss up.

02:10.573 --> 02:12.878
Where did you see Kristen this morning?

02:13.728 --> 02:15.062
Hm?

02:15.310 --> 02:19.213
We, uh, met for breakfast.

02:19.280 --> 02:22.783
Wait, I'm confused,
'cause it's 6:30 right now.

02:22.851 --> 02:25.385
So does that mean you got up
and drove from your house,

02:25.453 --> 02:27.154
and she got up and drove from her house

02:27.222 --> 02:29.656
to meet for breakfast before 6:00 a.m.?

02:29.724 --> 02:30.791
That's what happened.

02:30.866 --> 02:34.628
And what restaurant is open
at, like, 4:00 in the morning?

02:34.753 --> 02:36.443
It was a gas station.

02:36.444 --> 02:38.765
Gas station breakfast
usually starts at 6:00.

02:38.833 --> 02:40.547
- Was this BP or Mobil?
- Oh, I don't-I don't remember.

02:40.548 --> 02:42.603
Nah, fools, they're banging.

02:42.670 --> 02:43.570
- You know what I'm saying?
- Oh.

02:43.714 --> 02:45.339
He's getting a little breakfast action.

02:45.406 --> 02:46.306
Yeah.

03:01.974 --> 03:04.587
Wow, someone just
never picked up their photos.

03:04.759 --> 03:06.627
What do we do? Do we just toss them?

03:06.694 --> 03:09.263
Uh, well, first, we look
for any naked pictures,

03:09.330 --> 03:10.829
and I will be doing that.

03:11.466 --> 03:13.094
Dressed, dressed...

03:13.243 --> 03:14.877
- Hey, Glenn.
- Dressed.

03:14.951 --> 03:16.807
Landscape. Dressed.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.655
Do you feel good about
how that just went?

03:19.656 --> 03:20.541
I don't get it.

03:20.542 --> 03:22.476
Normally, my girlfriends' dads love me.

03:22.544 --> 03:24.031
I still keep in touch with most of them.

03:24.032 --> 03:26.256
I just took Naomi's dad
to a train museum.

03:26.257 --> 03:29.110
Oh, here we go.
Nope, that's just two peaches.

03:30.351 --> 03:32.373
Jonah, relax. Glenn likes you.

03:32.855 --> 03:34.916
Yeah, but he doesn't
seemed jazzed, you know.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.744
I want him... I want him to be jazzed.

03:36.745 --> 03:38.966
Just stop trying so hard.

03:39.460 --> 03:42.095
Eventually, he'll be...
I'm not gonna say jazzed.

03:42.163 --> 03:43.531
He's... he's gonna be fine with it.

03:43.532 --> 03:45.632
Does that look like a piece
of a butt to you guys?

03:45.700 --> 03:47.601
There's a lot of butts on the Internet.

03:47.669 --> 03:48.769
Have you tried looking there?

03:48.836 --> 03:50.971
It's too easy. I like the hunt.

03:51.072 --> 03:53.173
You just scan the barcode,

03:53.241 --> 03:56.099
and it shows you how many
units we have in inventory.

03:56.489 --> 04:00.581
Ha! Oh, yo, Cheyenne to
the boneyard immediately STAT.

04:00.648 --> 04:01.515
- Ha-ha, yeah.
- Charming.

04:01.517 --> 04:02.805
Can we just get back
to the scanning, though?

04:02.806 --> 04:05.265
Oh, I'll get back to it. Boom! Headshot.

04:05.266 --> 04:06.332
- Stop!
- One shot, one kill.

04:06.352 --> 04:07.689
- Would you...
- Pew-pew-pew-pew-pew-pew-pew.

04:07.690 --> 04:08.979
Do you wanna learn this stuff or not?

04:08.980 --> 04:11.291
What, this? Psh, not really... no.

04:11.359 --> 04:12.993
I'm just here to make
a quick 5 Gs, and then bounce,

04:13.061 --> 04:14.561
you know what I'm saying?
How long is it gonna take?

04:14.629 --> 04:15.963
Like a week, or something?

04:18.866 --> 04:20.399
Ha...

04:20.468 --> 04:22.336
All right, what's so funny?
What, somebody fart?

04:22.403 --> 04:24.438
Oh. Hey, Myrtle.

04:24.505 --> 04:26.573
- You've been here for 30 years?
- Yep.

04:26.641 --> 04:27.924
Okay, how much money have you saved?

04:27.925 --> 04:29.776
Almost $900.

04:29.844 --> 04:33.080
I'm almost ready to head
on out to California.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.887
I feel like I know this girl.

04:37.427 --> 04:39.163
Or maybe she worked here.

04:39.934 --> 04:41.735
Oh, yeah, she does look familiar.

04:41.796 --> 04:44.485
I was just focused on
the neck down before, so...

04:45.493 --> 04:47.606
Hey, Tate, do you recognize this girl?

04:47.692 --> 04:50.230
Like, maybe she worked here in
the last ten years or something.

04:50.298 --> 04:50.974
Hm.

04:51.266 --> 04:52.933
Oh, yeah, was the the one on Fluoxetine?

04:53.001 --> 04:53.791
No.

04:53.855 --> 04:54.755
That was Carol.

04:54.894 --> 04:56.661
Oh, maybe lithium.

04:56.663 --> 04:58.130
No.

04:58.305 --> 04:59.405
No, that was also Carol.

04:59.538 --> 05:01.972
Yeah, Carol is what we in
the medical profession call a...

05:01.973 --> 05:04.711
Cuckoo.

05:04.779 --> 05:07.147
- You can just say no.
- Yeah, no, I don't know her.

05:07.215 --> 05:08.949
Ooh, hey, let me know when you need, uh,

05:09.017 --> 05:10.442
refills on that skin stuff.

05:11.324 --> 05:13.538
Um, no... you were thinking of Carol.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.734
- He's thinking of Carol.
- Mm.

05:17.659 --> 05:19.593
You can't give up on your first day.

05:19.676 --> 05:21.392
Just give it a little
bit more time, okay?

05:21.393 --> 05:23.497
It's like... how are they
gonna pay us so little

05:23.499 --> 05:25.200
for all this work we're doing, huh?

05:25.256 --> 05:27.324
Cheyenne, I have your change.

05:30.107 --> 05:31.574
Great.

05:31.806 --> 05:34.408
$100, $200, $300, $400...

05:34.475 --> 05:35.776
Keep on spending, sheep.

05:35.843 --> 05:39.379
$500, $600, $700, $800...

05:39.447 --> 05:40.781
- Hey, Glenn.
- Oh.

05:40.848 --> 05:42.616
Brought you a cup of Joe.

05:42.684 --> 05:44.284
Coffee... cup of Joe.

05:44.352 --> 05:45.652
You've never heard
that expression before?

05:45.720 --> 05:48.121
No, why wouldn't you just say coffee?

05:48.189 --> 05:52.059
I don't know. Uh, it's more fun?

05:52.126 --> 05:53.527
Oh... oh, okay.

05:53.628 --> 05:55.395
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:55.463 --> 05:57.264
- Oh, it's black.
- Oh, yeah, sorry.

05:57.332 --> 05:58.598
I didn't know how you took it.

05:58.666 --> 06:00.649
It's fine, it's fine.

06:02.804 --> 06:03.669
Yeah, it's fine.

06:03.670 --> 06:06.273
So, what's going on? What's up?

06:06.341 --> 06:08.442
Um... uh, nothing.

06:08.509 --> 06:10.143
Well, I was just about to eat lunch.

06:10.244 --> 06:12.946
Oh, no kidding, I was just
about to eat my lunch too

06:13.014 --> 06:15.349
at, uh, 10:30.

06:15.416 --> 06:18.218
How 'bout we, uh... how about
we eat together, you know?

06:18.286 --> 06:20.253
- You wanna eat lunch with me?
- Yeah!

06:20.321 --> 06:21.988
Yeah, it'll give us
a chance to talk, you know,

06:22.090 --> 06:23.890
get to know each other. It'll be fun.

06:23.892 --> 06:24.682
Okay.

06:25.444 --> 06:28.012
Let me... let me just
finish this coffee.

06:30.631 --> 06:32.933
You know, you don't have to finish that.

06:33.000 --> 06:33.834
No, I love it.

06:33.924 --> 06:36.870
If... if you don't,
it's not gonna offend me.

06:36.938 --> 06:39.873
I just wanna get it over with.

06:41.481 --> 06:42.524
Um...

06:44.238 --> 06:45.362
I'll have a hot dog.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.678
Sorry, we don't have hot dogs.

06:47.679 --> 06:48.917
Cheeseburger then.

06:48.918 --> 06:50.887
We only really serve Mexican food.

06:51.434 --> 06:53.220
One Mexican cheeseburger.

06:53.306 --> 06:56.209
We'll have two beef quesadillas, please.

06:56.878 --> 06:58.345
You got it.

06:58.347 --> 07:00.214
- Quesadilla?
- Mm-hmm.

07:00.340 --> 07:01.320
Quesadilla.

07:03.097 --> 07:04.583
It's colorful in here.

07:04.584 --> 07:05.417
Yeah.

07:05.947 --> 07:07.948
This is fun.
Why haven't we done this before?

07:08.016 --> 07:10.891
You know what, I don't know.
It's... it's really nice

07:10.891 --> 07:13.189
to get to know each other
outside of work.

07:13.283 --> 07:14.722
Exactly.

07:15.302 --> 07:17.658
- Ask me anything.
- Uh, okay.

07:18.448 --> 07:19.849
Where were you born?

07:19.916 --> 07:20.850
Kansas City.

07:20.917 --> 07:21.595
Oh.

07:21.596 --> 07:24.190
Do Jewish people like snow?

07:25.260 --> 07:27.361
Um... some of us.

07:27.429 --> 07:28.295
- Wow.
- Yeah.

07:28.547 --> 07:30.938
- Your turn.
- Uh, do you have any siblings?

07:30.993 --> 07:33.225
Oh, what a strange question.

07:33.642 --> 07:35.330
Um, yeah, four.

07:36.177 --> 07:39.300
Uh, what's the biggest dog
you've ever seen, and why?

07:41.812 --> 07:44.589
Okay, try Veronica Harris.

07:44.590 --> 07:46.658
She quit in 2011.

07:46.726 --> 07:49.461
Veronica Harris.

07:49.529 --> 07:51.129
Oh, no, it's definitely not Veronica.

07:51.197 --> 07:53.398
Oh, Veronica.

07:53.466 --> 07:55.167
How is she doing?

07:55.234 --> 07:56.201
- Prison.
- What?

07:56.269 --> 07:57.820
Another one went to prison?

07:57.851 --> 08:00.753
- Yeah, we're kind of a feeder.
- Ugh, okay, um...

08:01.282 --> 08:03.046
try Robin Sanders.

08:04.444 --> 08:06.211
Ooh, no.

08:06.279 --> 08:08.180
Not Robin. Meth hit her hard.

08:08.281 --> 08:10.131
God, why do people do it?

08:10.750 --> 08:12.608
My guess... it feels incredible.

08:13.810 --> 08:15.811
Yo, let's say, like,
someone, like, got in here

08:15.988 --> 08:17.923
and took all that oxi,
and, like, got out.

08:17.990 --> 08:20.058
How do they, like, move that,
you know what I'm saying?

08:20.126 --> 08:21.993
Easy, you just go to
the nearest playground,

08:22.061 --> 08:24.096
and just sell the whole stash
to some rich moms.

08:24.163 --> 08:26.098
Yeah, all that pressure
to get their bods back

08:26.165 --> 08:29.067
after pregnancy...
it's gotta go somewhere, huh?

08:31.938 --> 08:33.972
My marriage is over.

08:35.741 --> 08:37.775
- They're deeply unhappy.
- Bo, um...

08:37.844 --> 08:40.846
you're not assigned to pharmacy.
What are you doing here?

08:40.913 --> 08:42.514
Oh, no reason.
I'm just hanging with my boy.

08:42.582 --> 08:44.449
Okay, 'cause it's a really good thing

08:44.517 --> 08:46.017
that you have this job,

08:46.085 --> 08:48.047
and I wouldn't want you to mess it up.

08:48.442 --> 08:50.242
No, don't worry, baby, all right?

08:50.569 --> 08:52.637
- Yo, thanks for the info, Dr. S.
- No problem.

08:52.792 --> 08:53.658
Uh...

08:53.726 --> 08:54.980
Real talk for a sec?

08:55.232 --> 08:57.442
- Yeah.
- I'm jealous of your mustache.

08:58.218 --> 08:59.648
Blesses and riches.

09:00.833 --> 09:02.734
- This was fun.
- I know, right?

09:02.802 --> 09:04.104
I-I'm so glad we did this.

09:04.105 --> 09:05.365
- Me too.
- Dessert?

09:05.872 --> 09:10.762
Uh, do you have
a Mexican version of a churro?

09:11.526 --> 09:13.627
Um, I think we can put
something together for you.

09:13.679 --> 09:14.537
You know what, actually, uh,

09:14.538 --> 09:16.095
I-I think we should probably head back.

09:16.096 --> 09:18.184
My break just ended five minutes ago.

09:18.185 --> 09:19.117
- Oh.
- Yeah.

09:19.289 --> 09:21.149
Well, why don't we call the boss?

09:22.109 --> 09:23.655
Hello, Glenn, it's Glenn.

09:23.723 --> 09:25.448
Can Jonah have an extra long lunch?

09:25.449 --> 09:27.459
What, he can? That's great.

09:27.527 --> 09:29.594
You're the best. Bye.

09:29.695 --> 09:32.297
I'm Glenn... same Glenn.
I mean, I'm both Glenns.

09:32.365 --> 09:33.265
Oh, okay.

09:33.472 --> 09:35.534
Yeah, you know, Glenn,
I-I appreciate it,

09:35.601 --> 09:38.303
but if... if you make
an exception for me,

09:38.371 --> 09:39.971
and then the other associates notice,

09:40.039 --> 09:41.339
they're probably gonna get jealous,

09:41.407 --> 09:43.271
and it'll get weird, so...

09:43.943 --> 09:45.277
I didn't think of it like that.

09:45.344 --> 09:46.444
I know. If I could,

09:46.512 --> 09:47.746
I would hang out all day,

09:47.847 --> 09:49.280
but, you know, life.

09:49.882 --> 09:51.388
Yeah, life.

09:51.764 --> 09:52.997
- I'll get the check.
- All right.

09:53.028 --> 09:56.130
Excuse me, sir, do you take
American dollars here?

09:58.455 --> 10:00.486
Well, this has escalated.

10:00.487 --> 10:02.828
I-I just feel like there's
gotta be something

10:02.895 --> 10:04.218
that tells us who she is,

10:04.573 --> 10:06.541
like a stack of mail
with an address on it,

10:06.766 --> 10:09.568
or... or... or... or like a...
a car with a license plate,

10:09.635 --> 10:10.702
and we can run the plate.

10:10.704 --> 10:12.204
Okay, explain to me the process

10:12.338 --> 10:14.539
by which we would run a plate.

10:14.607 --> 10:17.943
We would call someone on the force.

10:18.010 --> 10:18.748
The force?

10:18.749 --> 10:20.812
Yes, that is what people call it.

10:20.880 --> 10:24.516
Look, I am all for wasting
time on useless activities,

10:24.584 --> 10:27.085
but this is entering Carol territory.

10:27.153 --> 10:28.854
Look at that kitchen, Garrett.

10:28.921 --> 10:31.323
That's like a... a
million dollar kitchen.

10:31.390 --> 10:33.325
Aren't you the least bit curious

10:33.392 --> 10:35.393
about how someone who used to work here

10:35.494 --> 10:37.295
ended up in a house like that?

10:37.396 --> 10:38.730
Is that a solid oak table?

10:38.831 --> 10:40.565
Looks like a solid oak table.

10:40.633 --> 10:44.169
- And a French press.
- That is a French press.

10:44.237 --> 10:46.204
Do you know how much
disposable time you need

10:46.272 --> 10:49.374
to make French press coffee? Too much.

10:49.442 --> 10:51.743
We're gonna need to
make these a lot bigger.

10:51.811 --> 10:52.911
Yes.

10:57.583 --> 10:59.317
Hey, no one's allowed in here.

10:59.319 --> 11:01.854
Yeah, I got... I got
lost and stuff, so...

11:02.054 --> 11:04.322
Oh, hey, this is, like,
real badass, you know.

11:04.390 --> 11:06.458
This is like CTU
headquarters or something.

11:06.525 --> 11:08.260
You're like Jack Bauer,
you know what I'm saying?

11:08.384 --> 11:09.617
I don't know that

11:09.619 --> 11:11.653
I could actually do
everything that he...

11:12.231 --> 11:14.532
You know what? No.
Accept the compliment.

11:14.634 --> 11:15.333
Thank you.

11:15.351 --> 11:17.006
Yeah, you got a tough job, for real.

11:17.007 --> 11:19.170
You know, there's, like, a lot
of dangerous people out there.

11:19.238 --> 11:21.773
You got gang bangers
running around, Slender Man.

11:21.841 --> 11:23.241
Whoa, oh, where is he?
You know what I'm saying?

11:23.349 --> 11:24.333
Oh, ISISes.

11:24.346 --> 11:26.013
I worry about ISIS all the time.

11:26.178 --> 11:28.246
You know, people spend so much
time watching the coasts.

11:28.314 --> 11:29.948
You know where
they're gonna strike first?

11:30.016 --> 11:32.050
Right here in the heartland.

11:32.118 --> 11:33.852
Yeah, what's up, truth?

11:33.920 --> 11:35.104
So I'm, like, thinking, like,

11:35.363 --> 11:37.355
I wanna learn about all this,
you know what I'm saying?

11:37.860 --> 11:39.157
You know, like, the
cameras and the locks

11:39.225 --> 11:40.959
and the alarms and all that.

11:41.027 --> 11:43.009
- Fellow security buff, huh?
- Yeah.

11:43.010 --> 11:44.796
Ha, who knew? Here I thought

11:44.864 --> 11:46.631
you were nothing more
than a worthless dirt bag.

11:46.699 --> 11:48.597
Nah, I contain multitudes, yo.

11:49.335 --> 11:50.837
Hey, you wanted to see me?

11:50.914 --> 11:53.204
I just talked to
corporate, and they said

11:53.272 --> 11:55.707
as long as I don't give you
a raise of any kind,

11:55.775 --> 11:57.776
I can make you my assistant.

11:57.843 --> 12:00.460
Now we get to hang out all day.

12:01.013 --> 12:04.149
Uh, this is a shock.

12:06.101 --> 12:10.804
11 Mississippi, 12 Mississippi, 13.

12:12.607 --> 12:14.675
Uh, he says to count to 13.

12:14.742 --> 12:16.343
He likes it more as a slurry.

12:16.952 --> 12:20.014
So as his assistant,
do you have to wear the tie?

12:20.354 --> 12:21.760
Uh, no.

12:21.978 --> 12:23.550
He... he said it... it...

12:23.963 --> 12:26.650
it makes it easier for
the two of us to play pranks.

12:27.432 --> 12:30.855
Well, on the bright side,
he's now good and jazzed, yeah?

12:30.857 --> 12:31.869
Yeah, yeah.

12:32.002 --> 12:33.869
I just love the tie.

12:34.265 --> 12:36.633
- It makes me so happy.
- Glad to hear that.

12:36.635 --> 12:39.103
So are you his assistant now forever?

12:39.127 --> 12:40.627
No, no... no... no, just, like,

12:40.812 --> 12:43.247
until Kristen and I break up.

12:43.251 --> 12:44.919
But what happens
if you guys get married?

12:45.011 --> 12:47.035
Oh, well, then... well, then, uh...

12:47.651 --> 12:49.953
I guess until Glenn dies.

12:50.105 --> 12:51.906
The tie just makes me so happy, man.

12:51.928 --> 12:54.425
I mean, it's like you're
a little, tiny businessman.

12:55.753 --> 12:57.539
Only about half the cameras work.

12:57.540 --> 12:58.995
The rest are just deterrents.

12:58.996 --> 13:01.304
But the thieves don't know
where the blind spots are.

13:01.311 --> 13:03.034
Oh, he's totally packing, right?

13:03.035 --> 13:05.688
Oh, no, no, Reggie can't
hold an actual weapon.

13:06.141 --> 13:08.409
And as a matter of fact,
between you and I,

13:08.410 --> 13:10.137
he's almost completely blind.

13:10.668 --> 13:13.301
What do you think
is going on over there?

13:13.530 --> 13:14.555
I don't know.

13:15.047 --> 13:16.681
Whoo! God...

13:17.038 --> 13:19.539
why is that so satisfying?

13:23.051 --> 13:25.448
We're probably gonna have

13:25.449 --> 13:27.828
a lot of inside jokes, aren't we?

13:27.964 --> 13:29.465
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:29.742 --> 13:32.211
What do you think
our first one should be?

13:33.888 --> 13:35.786
I'm gonna go to the men's room.

13:35.787 --> 13:37.991
Me too! Look at this.

13:38.059 --> 13:40.307
Our cycles are synching up already.

13:41.863 --> 13:43.607
Okay, that tree outside the window...

13:43.608 --> 13:44.568
it's a sycamore tree.

13:44.569 --> 13:46.867
Great, now all we need to know

13:46.934 --> 13:48.735
is where sycamore trees grow.

13:48.803 --> 13:51.048
Okay, sycamores... they grow in
the Southern parts of Missouri.

13:51.049 --> 13:52.235
Missouri.

13:52.236 --> 13:54.284
Large swaths of the Eastern Seaboard.

13:54.598 --> 13:57.650
There's no sycamores on the West Coast.

13:58.179 --> 13:59.946
- Okay...
- Except for Washington state.

13:59.947 --> 14:02.805
And there's a large group
of them in Australia.

14:03.117 --> 14:04.420
We got nothing.

14:05.167 --> 14:08.286
I don't get it.
Where do we know her from?

14:08.287 --> 14:11.089
- Which one goes where?
- I don't know.

14:11.090 --> 14:12.805
I couldn't find the reference photos.

14:12.806 --> 14:14.370
Did you check up your butt?

14:15.279 --> 14:16.190
No.

14:21.202 --> 14:23.170
- You going yet?
- No, still not yet.

14:23.237 --> 14:25.238
- Oh.
- You know, I...

14:25.306 --> 14:27.330
I-I could probably meet you
back in the office.

14:27.331 --> 14:28.526
Oh, I don't mind.

14:30.110 --> 14:31.681
Hey, what do you think about

14:31.682 --> 14:34.127
going to a baseball game
with me this weekend?

14:34.128 --> 14:36.183
- Yeah, that... I'd love that.
- Yeah?

14:37.068 --> 14:37.918
Yeah. Of course, you know,

14:37.985 --> 14:39.753
the other employees might think

14:39.821 --> 14:41.269
that you're playing favorites, so...

14:41.270 --> 14:42.846
We don't have to tell them.

14:43.423 --> 14:46.221
Right, but then it gets,
you know, even weirder,

14:46.222 --> 14:47.790
because it's like... now we're lying,

14:47.791 --> 14:50.041
so it'd be... it'd be
a whole thing, trust me.

14:50.042 --> 14:52.132
Yeah, you're probably right.

14:54.488 --> 14:56.102
Boy, when you finally go,

14:56.170 --> 14:57.737
it's really gonna be
something, isn't it?

14:57.805 --> 14:59.406
Yeah.

15:00.088 --> 15:01.403
Hey, Dina.

15:01.606 --> 15:03.364
How are things going with Bo?

15:03.365 --> 15:05.216
Uh, is he doing okay?

15:05.217 --> 15:07.418
Doing okay? He's a surv-head.

15:07.486 --> 15:08.953
Sorry, surveillance head.

15:09.021 --> 15:10.221
I forgot you weren't a surv-head.

15:10.289 --> 15:11.990
Oh. Okay.

15:12.091 --> 15:16.544
Um, but is he, like, acting
a little weird around you?

15:16.591 --> 15:18.296
You mean how he wants
to have sex with me?

15:18.364 --> 15:20.131
- Uh...
- Listen, relax, okay?

15:20.232 --> 15:22.066
I'm not interested.
Not enough body hair.

15:22.134 --> 15:23.534
He looks like a newborn mouse.

15:23.602 --> 15:25.770
Oh... okay, good.

15:25.871 --> 15:28.539
You should really have
a little more trust in your man.

15:28.641 --> 15:30.208
Yeah.

15:30.276 --> 15:32.677
You're right. I should trust him.

15:32.745 --> 15:33.745
Thanks.

15:36.109 --> 15:38.087
And listen, if he masturbates
to me on his lunch break,

15:38.142 --> 15:39.757
that's his business, okay?

15:39.820 --> 15:40.785
It's not my fault.

15:40.853 --> 15:42.420
Okay.

15:42.521 --> 15:44.789
So corporate sent me two tickets

15:44.857 --> 15:46.585
to this weekend's Cardinals game,

15:46.625 --> 15:50.428
so I'm gonna pick one
employee to go with me...

15:50.496 --> 15:52.043
completely at random.

15:52.153 --> 15:55.196
So all your names are in here,
and it's time to pick now.

15:55.720 --> 15:57.855
Is it Saturday or Sunday,
'cause I-I actually have...

15:57.923 --> 15:59.924
It doesn't matter, Sandra.

15:59.991 --> 16:01.826
- I'm cremating my dog.
- Jonah!

16:01.827 --> 16:03.682
- You didn't even read it.
- I glanced at it.

16:03.683 --> 16:05.629
I did not see you glance at it.

16:05.697 --> 16:08.566
Congratulations, Jonah! Yeah!

16:08.667 --> 16:11.435
So, uh, if you, uh, see
us on the jumbotron,

16:11.503 --> 16:12.755
this is how that happened.

16:12.756 --> 16:14.271
You know what,
I'm worried about traffic.

16:14.339 --> 16:15.839
Maybe you guys should
head down there early,

16:15.907 --> 16:17.308
- and make a day out of it.
- Yeah.

16:17.409 --> 16:18.785
That's a great idea.

16:18.786 --> 16:22.810
Uh, yeah, you know what, uh,
I am all booked up this weekend.

16:22.810 --> 16:23.590
Oh...

16:24.701 --> 16:27.854
well, I didn't literally mean,
like, this weekend.

16:27.980 --> 16:29.480
I-I meant, like, um,

16:29.881 --> 16:32.750
when this nearest weekend
is over, then that weekend.

16:32.818 --> 16:35.753
Uh, oh, well, uh, this is frustrating.

16:35.821 --> 16:37.561
I am booked up then too.

16:37.562 --> 16:39.981
I'll go. I love b-ball.

16:39.982 --> 16:41.992
Oh, yeah, that's what
they call baseball.

16:41.993 --> 16:43.789
No, nobody else is going.

16:43.790 --> 16:45.663
Jonah won, so Jonah's coming with me.

16:45.731 --> 16:47.008
No, Glenn, I did... I didn't win.

16:47.009 --> 16:48.366
- I... somebody else should...
- No, you won.

16:48.444 --> 16:50.025
- No, I didn't win... I clearly...
- Fair and square.

16:50.032 --> 16:51.509
- But I can't do it, Glenn.
- No, you...

16:51.511 --> 16:52.600
I'm sure you can move stuff around.

16:52.601 --> 16:54.034
I'm completely booked
up, and then I can't.

16:54.047 --> 16:56.081
- I can't go.
- Winners go, losers don't go.

16:56.105 --> 16:57.106
Glenn, I don't wanna hang out with you.

17:01.236 --> 17:03.261
All right, looks like I'm in.

17:04.039 --> 17:05.239
Oh, one condition,

17:05.434 --> 17:08.435
uh, if I catch a foul ball,
I'm not giving it to a kid.

17:10.579 --> 17:11.713
I respect that.

17:18.156 --> 17:22.260
Uh, Glenn, I just came by to...
to return this.

17:22.328 --> 17:25.363
- Eugene?
- Thank you.

17:25.431 --> 17:27.299
- Ahem, Glen?
- Thanks.

17:27.366 --> 17:29.510
I'll put this on my new assistant.

17:30.675 --> 17:32.342
Hey, so, listen,

17:32.344 --> 17:34.306
I'm sorry I lied about
wanting to hang out.

17:34.373 --> 17:36.608
Your breath is warm.

17:36.676 --> 17:40.078
Uh, hey, Eugene, could...
could we maybe have a minute?

17:40.146 --> 17:42.614
- Of course.
- Thanks.

17:43.916 --> 17:45.650
Glen, I, uh...

17:45.718 --> 17:47.919
I get that you felt weird

17:47.987 --> 17:49.587
about me dating Kristen,

17:49.653 --> 17:51.456
and... I don't know... I guess
I just thought

17:51.458 --> 17:54.259
if we spent some time together,
maybe I could win you over.

17:55.041 --> 17:55.894
I get it.

17:56.893 --> 17:57.835
It's tricky.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.261
I mean, you're dating my daughter,

18:00.431 --> 18:02.346
and I'm a strong alpha.

18:02.347 --> 18:03.774
No, yeah, yeah, exactly.

18:04.210 --> 18:07.837
But please, from now on,
just be honest with me.

18:07.839 --> 18:09.494
Absolutely. You have my word.

18:09.532 --> 18:10.540
Okay.

18:11.127 --> 18:14.430
Hey, did Kristen sleep over
at your apartment last night?

18:16.677 --> 18:19.802
No, we met for breakfast
at 4:00 a.m. at a gas station.

18:20.751 --> 18:23.353
Thanks, that's what I thought.

18:24.455 --> 18:26.049
Even if we never find out who she is,

18:26.049 --> 18:27.916
isn't it nice to know
that at least one person

18:27.984 --> 18:29.451
who worked here didn't end up on drugs,

18:29.519 --> 18:32.254
or in prison, or fused to a couch?

18:32.322 --> 18:34.072
Mm, the future is bright.

18:34.324 --> 18:36.792
Yep, I can smell the
French press coffee now.

18:36.860 --> 18:38.327
Eh, why wait?

18:38.394 --> 18:41.096
Don't we sell one of those French
presses here in the store?

18:43.021 --> 18:44.002
What?

18:44.868 --> 18:47.136
She's a Cloud 9 model.

18:48.138 --> 18:48.932
Yep.

18:49.906 --> 18:52.774
You still want to pick up
the French press?

18:52.842 --> 18:53.778
Nope.

18:54.402 --> 18:57.278
You know, I do think I have
seen that woman naked, though.

18:57.280 --> 18:59.741
Yeah, you think
you've seen everyone naked.

19:00.851 --> 19:02.756
I can't believe I doubted him.

19:02.757 --> 19:04.900
I mean, he's the father of my child.

19:05.493 --> 19:08.028
Do you think this is
chocolate sauce or blood?

19:08.096 --> 19:09.124
Chocolate.

19:09.531 --> 19:11.198
I mean, maybe something's wrong with me.

19:11.266 --> 19:13.300
Maybe I can't trust
the people in my life,

19:13.368 --> 19:15.135
because of my relationship with my dad.

19:15.203 --> 19:17.371
Um, Cheyenne...

19:23.611 --> 19:25.212
Yep, it is blood.

19:26.614 --> 19:29.283
Whoa. Oh, hey, boo.

19:29.351 --> 19:30.784
I can't believe you.

19:30.852 --> 19:32.686
What? No, no, no,
it's not what you think, okay?

19:32.754 --> 19:34.521
I was just gonna hide out here
until the store closes,

19:34.589 --> 19:35.838
and then I was gonna rob the place.

19:35.839 --> 19:38.058
That is what I thought you were doing!

19:38.126 --> 19:40.728
Wow, you know,
I love how you know me so well.

19:40.795 --> 19:43.197
We could probably both
get fired from you doing this.

19:43.264 --> 19:45.464
Did you even realize
how this would affect me?

19:45.465 --> 19:47.401
Yeah, I was doing this for you, okay?

19:47.469 --> 19:49.169
So our wedding would be sick as hell.

19:49.237 --> 19:51.572
It would have, like,
peacocks and Flo Rida

19:51.639 --> 19:53.407
and dope-ass peonies.

19:53.475 --> 19:55.409
I don't need all that.

19:55.477 --> 19:56.016
Really?

19:56.102 --> 19:58.310
Let's just have a nice, simple wedding,

19:58.310 --> 19:59.845
and then we save up our money,

19:59.847 --> 20:02.513
we can spend it on something important,

20:02.581 --> 20:06.183
like one of those Jacuzzis
with the purple lights,

20:06.251 --> 20:09.059
or those gold teeth
that you've always wanted.

20:09.754 --> 20:11.807
Damn, girl, you're too good for me.

20:12.691 --> 20:13.945
Totally.

20:17.596 --> 20:19.930
Attention, y'all are bitch ass hoes.

20:19.998 --> 20:20.931
I quit!

20:23.442 --> 20:25.367
I'm keeping the vest.
Oh, no, you're not.

20:25.368 --> 20:26.804
No, no, okay, hold on, hold on.

20:26.872 --> 20:28.339
Just let... let me get if off!

20:28.406 --> 20:29.804
Putting it down, boss.

20:30.509 --> 20:32.810
Oh! Just kidding! Suck it!

20:32.878 --> 20:35.379
Oh!

20:35.487 --> 20:36.940
I quit. Did you hear that?

20:41.753 --> 20:43.654
Glenn Sturgis's office?

20:43.722 --> 20:46.053
Hi, Jeff, let me see
if I can get him for you.

20:46.054 --> 20:48.359
- I have Jeff for you.
- Thank you.

20:51.200 --> 20:54.398
- Hi, Jeff.
- Hey, I have some bad news.

20:54.499 --> 20:56.233
Uh, the headline is every branch

20:56.301 --> 20:58.802
is gonna have to lay off
10% of its workforce.

20:58.870 --> 21:01.572
So... um...

21:01.640 --> 21:03.807
Should I go tell everybody?

21:03.875 --> 21:04.495
Glenn?
