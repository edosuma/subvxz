THE FIRST PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE.

06:54.831 --> 06:57.500
{\an8}- THE BOYS GOT FIRST
LAST TIME,

06:57.583 --> 06:59.335
{\an8}SO THEY GOT THE BEST ROOM
AND I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR

06:59.418 --> 07:01.546
{\an8}IF THEY FIRST AGAIN,
SO WE'RE MAKING SURE

07:01.629 --> 07:03.840
{\an8}THAT NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES,
WE'LL BE FIRST.

07:03.923 --> 07:04.757
{\an8}- TRAFFIC!

07:04.841 --> 07:07.552
{\an8}- AH!

07:09.178 --> 07:12.348
{\an8}- ...IN TWO MILES.

07:12.431 --> 07:14.142
{\an8}- I WAS ACTUALLY TALKING
TO ANGELINA.

07:14.225 --> 07:15.685
{\an8}SAID, "I HEARD YOU'RE
GOING DOWN TO MIAMI."

07:15.768 --> 07:16.894
{\an8}- WHAT?

07:16.978 --> 07:17.645
{\an8}- THIS, THAT,
AND THE OTHER THING.

07:17.728 --> 07:19.564
{\an8}- THINK SHE MIGHT SHOW UP?

07:19.647 --> 07:20.982
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW IF ANGELINA'S
GONNA MAKE IT TO MIAMI.

07:21.065 --> 07:22.567
{\an8}BUT WHETHER SHE COMES OR NOT
MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME

07:22.650 --> 07:24.819
{\an8}AS LONG AS DOESN'T [bleep]BLOCK
LIKE SHE DID IN JERSEY.

07:24.902 --> 07:26.445
{\an8}- DID PAULY D GET
A LITTLE TASTE OF THAT?

07:26.529 --> 07:28.489
{\an8}- YEAH, A LITTLE
TASTE OF THAT TOO.

07:28.573 --> 07:29.574
{\an8}I WAS AT A CLUB IN L.A.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.075
{\an8}I WAS DRUNK.
ANGELINA WAS THERE.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.827
{\an8}SHE WAS DRUNK.
WE'RE HOOKING UP.

07:32.910 --> 07:34.245
{\an8}ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER, BUT--

07:34.328 --> 07:35.413
{\an8}- THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW--

07:35.496 --> 07:35.955
{\an8}- THE NEXT NIGHT IT WAS
ON TO THE NEXT ONE.

07:36.038 --> 07:38.207
{\an8}ANGELINA WHO?

07:38.291 --> 07:43.129
{\an8}I DON'T REMEMBER IT
AFTER THAT.

07:43.212 --> 07:46.090
{\an8}- NEW AND IMPROVED ANGELINA.
HERE I COME.

07:46.174 --> 07:48.176
{\an8}I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT
I GOT A SECOND SHOT,

07:48.259 --> 07:49.135
{\an8}'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE,

07:49.218 --> 07:51.304
{\an8}LIKE, EVERYBODY DESERVES
A SECOND SHOT.

07:51.387 --> 07:53.264
{\an8}SO NOW I GET A CHANCE
TO SHOW EVERYBODY,

07:53.347 --> 07:54.891
{\an8}LIKE, THE REAL ANGELINA.

07:54.974 --> 07:57.018
{\an8}NOT, LIKE, YOU KNOW,
ONLY THE BITCHY SIDE.

07:57.101 --> 07:58.644
{\an8}I WAS ONLY IN THE HOUSE
FOR A SHORT, YOU KNOW,

07:58.728 --> 08:01.731
{\an8}AMOUNT OF TIME AND THE GIRLS
WERE JEALOUS.

08:01.814 --> 08:05.151
{\an8}- "I'M THE KIM KARDASHIAN

08:05.234 --> 08:07.570
{\an8}WITH WHAT ASS?

08:07.653 --> 08:11.282
{\an8}PANCAKE ASS.

08:11.365 --> 08:13.326
{\an8}- WHAT ARE WE DOING TODAY?

08:13.409 --> 08:14.785
{\an8}- BRAZILIAN WAX.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.913
{\an8}- I'VE BEEN TALKING TO PAULY D
ON THE PHONE A LOT.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.790
{\an8}I'VE BEEN TALKING TO SITUATION
A LOT ON THE PHONE ALSO.

08:19.874 --> 08:21.334
{\an8}[rip]

08:21.417 --> 08:22.752

THEY WERE GOING TO MIAMI,

08:22.835 --> 08:25.796
{\an8}SO, UM, THEY BASICALLY INVITED
ME AND I'M GONNA GO.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.089
{\an8}I'M GOING TO MIAMI.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.508
{\an8}THE BITCH OF STATEN ISLAND
IS BACK

08:29.592 --> 08:32.094
{\an8}AND READY TO [bleep] PARTY.

08:32.178 --> 08:37.225
{\an8}- ROAD TRIP IT UP.

08:37.308 --> 08:38.976
{\an8}- WE ABOUT TO MAKE IT
HAPPEN RIGHT NOW.

08:39.059 --> 08:40.561
{\an8}- WE WENT FIREWORKS SHOPPING,

08:40.645 --> 08:43.731
{\an8}BECAUSE IT'S LEGAL
IN SOUTH CAROLINA.

08:43.813 --> 08:45.358
{\an8}THAT'S HOW WE DO IT, MAN.

08:45.441 --> 08:50.029
{\an8}- LET'S BLOW SOME [bleep] UP.

08:50.112 --> 08:52.740
{\an8}WE FIND THIS CORN FIELD

08:59.247 --> 09:01.582
{\an8}I'M STUCK AS HELL.

{\an8}- WHEN I SAY WE GOT IT
STUCK IN THE MUD,

09:03.167 --> 09:05.294
{\an8}LIKE, STUCK IN THE MUD.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.671
{\an8}ALL FOUR WHEELS
ARE STUCK IN THE MUD.

09:06.754 --> 09:08.339
{\an8}- I'M NOT EVEN WORRIED
ABOUT IT.

09:08.422 --> 09:12.093
{\an8}I GOT TRIPLE "A."
I'M A GOLD MEMBER.

09:12.176 --> 09:13.010
{\an8}WE SHOULD PROBABLY LEAVE

{\an8}AND GO TO THIS BAR.

10:22.455 --> 10:27.543
{\an8}ALL YOU HEAR IS CRICKETS.

10:27.626 --> 10:29.920
{\an8}SO AT THAT POINT, WHAT WE WANTED
TO DO WAS JUST EAT,

10:30.004 --> 10:32.715
{\an8}CHILL OUT AND GET
THE HELL OUT OF THERE.

10:32.798 --> 10:33.966

A LIFE-CHANGING EXPERIENCE.

15:23.964 --> 15:25.049
{\an8}WHATEVER.

15:25.132 --> 15:26.467
{\an8}I THINK THEY SHOULD ALL
GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE.

15:26.550 --> 15:28.010
{\an8}I THINK THAT I DESERVE
A SHOT AND I WOULD DO

15:28.093 --> 15:31.180
{\an8}WHATEVER IT TAKES TO BASICALLY
BE COOL WITH THESE PEOPLE,

15:31.263 --> 15:36.060

16:02.544 --> 16:03.629
{\an8}I WOULD MAKE SURE
I GET A ROOM,

16:03.712 --> 16:04.546
{\an8}BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT

16:13.055 --> 16:14.139
{\an8}- I THINK THERE MAY BE.

16:14.223 --> 16:15.474

16:22.481 --> 16:26.193
{\an8}- RONNIE HAD TO RELEASE
ALL HIS DEMONS THAT NIGHT.

16:26.276 --> 16:28.987
{\an8}- [laughs]
I LOVE SINGLE RONNIE.

16:39.581 --> 16:40.541

16:54.888 --> 16:56.265
{\an8}I'M SO EXCITED.

16:56.348 --> 16:58.100
{\an8}ROOMING WITH YOU GUYS
