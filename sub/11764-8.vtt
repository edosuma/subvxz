WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:02.103
HERE YOU GO, MOM.

00:02.103 --> 00:03.474
THANK YOU.

00:03.474 --> 00:05.076
BETSY, I CAN'T WAIT TO TRY
YOUR HOMEMADE MUFFINS.

00:05.076 --> 00:07.378
(mouth full)
MMM. SNOOZE, YOU LOSE, DUDE.

00:07.378 --> 00:08.709
(mouth full) OH, MAN.
THESE ARE SO GOOD.

00:08.709 --> 00:09.710
SO GOOD.

00:09.710 --> 00:11.112
OH, MAN.

00:11.112 --> 00:15.286
(gravelly voice) BIG BUBBA
NEEDS FOOD. COME ON. FEED ME.

00:15.286 --> 00:18.389
OH. SORRY YOU HAD TO MEET
MR. BELLY-FACE, MA'AM.

00:18.389 --> 00:20.151
WELL, I SHOULD
GO CHECK ON STAN.

00:20.151 --> 00:22.323
THANKS, MOM.

00:22.323 --> 00:24.155
(clenches teeth)
LET'S GO. GET OUT.

00:24.155 --> 00:26.057
DROP THOSE MUFFINS.

00:26.057 --> 00:28.199
DID YOU HEAR HER?

00:28.199 --> 00:31.062
SHE HAS TO GO "CHECK ON STAN"
'CAUSE WHAT?

00:31.062 --> 00:33.164
I PAY SO LITTLE
ATTENTION TO HIM

00:33.164 --> 00:35.035
THAT HE MIGHT JUST
WALK OUT THE FRONT DOOR

00:35.035 --> 00:38.038
AND KNOCK DOWN
SOME NEIGHBOR'S MAILBOX?

00:38.038 --> 00:40.671
WELL, THAT DID HAPPEN
YESTERDAY TO MY MAILBOX.

00:40.671 --> 00:42.143
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

00:42.143 --> 00:45.676
NOW IS SHE OR IS SHE NOT
THE WORST?

00:45.676 --> 00:47.748
OOH. GOD-AWFUL.
I CAN'T HER. HORRIBLE.

00:47.748 --> 00:49.380
I THOUGHT
SHE SEEMED PRETTY COOL.

00:49.380 --> 00:50.821
(whispers) WOW.
OOH.

00:50.821 --> 00:52.453
YOU'VE ALWAYS
BEEN DEAD TO ME,

00:52.453 --> 00:55.826
BUT NOW
YOU ARE EVEN DEADER.

00:55.826 --> 00:57.258
WAY TO GO, NEW GUY.

00:57.258 --> 00:58.659
"NEW GUY"?
(door opens)

00:58.659 --> 01:01.162
I AM A KEY MEMBER
OF THIS GROUP.
(door closes)

01:01.162 --> 01:02.433
I PROVIDE THE SIZZLE.

01:02.433 --> 01:04.395
(hisses)
AND, YES, SHE'S SWEET,

01:04.395 --> 01:06.097
AND SHE MAKES MUFFINS SO GOOD

01:06.097 --> 01:08.239
THAT I'M SMUSHING TOGETHER
THE CRUMBS FOR BOBBY.

01:08.239 --> 01:09.500
YOU'RE MAKING ME
A MUFFIN BALL?

01:09.500 --> 01:10.501
YOU'RE WELCOME.
(thud)

01:10.501 --> 01:11.572
OH.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.544
STILL, ELLIE THINKS
SHE'S HORRIBLE,

01:13.544 --> 01:15.246
SO WE ALL AGREE WITH HER.
(door closes)

01:15.246 --> 01:17.248
OH.

01:18.249 --> 01:19.580
I THINK I CAN FIX THIS.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.582
HALF PINT,
WHAT'S BETSY REALLY LIKE?

01:21.582 --> 01:24.084
I'LL ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL TO BETSY
'CAUSE THE ONLY REASON ELLIE

01:24.084 --> 01:26.117
DATED ME IN THE FIRST PLACE
WAS TO PISS HER OFF.

01:26.117 --> 01:28.689
WOW, YOU'RE LIKE
A BIG, CUBAN MIDDLE FINGER.

01:28.689 --> 01:30.861
JUNO IT, MANG.

01:30.861 --> 01:33.224
MMM.

01:33.224 --> 01:34.695
(high-pitched voice)
THANK YOU.

01:34.695 --> 01:37.468
(normal voice) YOU'RE WELCOME,
BUBB. YOU'RE WELCOME.

01:37.468 --> 01:39.270
(whistles)

01:40.631 --> 01:45.676
в™Єв™Єв™Є

01:45.676 --> 01:48.779
JULES, WOULD YOU
PLEASE PASS THE SALT?

01:48.779 --> 01:49.780
SURE.

01:49.780 --> 01:51.111
THANK YOU.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.743
WHAT? YOU SAID SOMETHING NICE
ABOUT HER MOM,

01:52.743 --> 01:54.485
AND NOW SHE'S NOT
SPEAKING TO YOU.

01:54.485 --> 01:56.787
THAT'S GREAT.

01:56.787 --> 01:59.320
OKAY, HOW ABOUT WE ALL AGREE
NOT TO TALK ABOUT OUR MOMS?

01:59.320 --> 02:01.522
I MEAN, IT'S EASY FOR ME
BECAUSE MY MOM'S DEAD.

02:01.522 --> 02:02.523
MINE, TOO.

02:02.523 --> 02:04.595
DEAD-MOM HIGH FIVE.

02:04.595 --> 02:07.698
PEOPLE THAT I USED TO TALK TO
JUST DON'T GET IT.

02:07.698 --> 02:11.232
I KNOW MY MOM SEEMS NICE,
BUT SHE'S LIKE THAT CARTOON FROG

02:11.232 --> 02:13.604
THAT SINGS AND DANCES
WHEN NO ONE'S LOOKING,

02:13.604 --> 02:15.336
ONLY INSTEAD OF
SINGING AND DANCING,

02:15.336 --> 02:17.137
SHE TELLS ME
I HAVE LESBIAN LEGS.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.410
EVERYBODY HAS ISSUES
WITH THEIR MOM, OKAY?

02:19.410 --> 02:22.613
I'M SURE SHE'S NOT AS BAD AS
YOU SAY. JULES AGREES WITH ME.

02:22.613 --> 02:23.714
(clank)
(chuckles)

02:23.714 --> 02:25.576
DID YOU JUST TRY AND KICK ME?

02:25.576 --> 02:27.278
(strained voice)
I'M WEARING SANDALS.

02:27.278 --> 02:30.150
YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT MY MOM
IS A COLD, HEARTLESS SOCIOPATH?

02:30.150 --> 02:31.722
SHE MADE ME MUFFINS.

02:31.722 --> 02:33.254
OH, ELLIE--

02:33.254 --> 02:34.225
NO.

02:34.225 --> 02:36.187
OH, GREAT.
NOW SHE'S NOT TALKING TO ME.

02:36.187 --> 02:37.188
SORRY.

02:37.188 --> 02:38.929
NO. NOW I'M NOT
TALKING TO YOU.

02:38.929 --> 02:40.731
BEST MEAL I EVER HAD.

02:40.731 --> 02:43.264
(hums)

02:44.265 --> 02:47.298
HEY, NEW GUY.

02:47.298 --> 02:48.599
I KNOW IT SUCKS BEING NEW.

02:48.599 --> 02:52.203
IN COLLEGE, I WAS HAZED SO BADLY
MY FIRST YEAR OF SPIRIT SQUAD.

02:53.574 --> 02:55.406
I JUST SAID
I WAS A MALE CHEERLEADER,

02:55.406 --> 02:57.448
AND YOU DON'T HAVE
A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION?

02:57.448 --> 02:58.579
I'M GOOD.

02:58.579 --> 02:59.680
YOU KNOW,
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE "NEW GUY"

02:59.680 --> 03:01.452
UNTIL YOU DIG DEEPER
WITH YOUR FRIENDS.

03:01.452 --> 03:03.284
HI, GUYS.
OBSERVE.

03:03.284 --> 03:05.716
HEY, LAURIE.
I WAS JUST TELLING GRAYSON HERE

03:05.716 --> 03:07.488
ABOUT MY FIRST YEAR
IN SPIRIT SQUAD.

03:07.488 --> 03:11.492
O.M.G.-SPOT,
TELL ME EVERYTHING.
EH?

03:11.492 --> 03:13.824
OKAY, WAIT. WHERE DO YOU BUY
THOSE BIG, HONKING WRISTBANDS?

03:13.824 --> 03:15.526
DID THE GIRLS
LET YOU TOUCH THEIR JUNK

03:15.526 --> 03:16.927
'CAUSE THEY THOUGHT
YOU WERE GAY?

03:16.927 --> 03:19.830
HOW HIGH COULD YOU KICK?
COULD YOU KICK THIS HIGH? WHOO!

03:23.203 --> 03:25.236
(sighs)

03:25.236 --> 03:28.509
IT'S FRIDAY, AND YOU'RE WATCHING
SIG PLAY COMPUTER SOLITAIRE?

03:28.509 --> 03:31.211
SO LAME.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.344
YO, DROP A JACK
ON THAT RED BITCH.

03:33.344 --> 03:35.786
COME ON, GUYS.

03:35.786 --> 03:38.249
WE HAVE
THIS AWESOME PARTY HOUSE,

03:38.249 --> 03:39.720
BUT CHICKS NEVER COME HERE.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.352
OKAY? AND MAYBE...

03:41.352 --> 03:44.395
THE HELMET I WORE FOR THE LAST
SIX WEEKS WAS HOLDING US BACK.

03:44.395 --> 03:45.296
I DON'T KNOW.

03:45.296 --> 03:46.827
COULD BE,
EVERY TIME A CHICK DOES SHOW UP,

03:46.827 --> 03:48.559
SIG SHOOTS NOSE BLOOD
ALL OVER HER.

03:48.559 --> 03:51.302
I GET STRESS BLEEDS, OKAY?
I COULD DIE.

03:51.302 --> 03:52.403
YOU COULDN'T.

03:52.403 --> 03:54.265
LOOK, WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING

03:54.265 --> 03:56.767
TO LET THIS CAMPUS KNOW
THAT WE EXIST. OKAY?

03:56.767 --> 03:59.710
AND I HAVE AN IDEA, BUT WE'RE
GONNA NEED SOME HELP, SO...

03:59.710 --> 04:02.012
WHO FARTED?

04:02.012 --> 04:03.774
OH, GOOD. YOUR DAD'S HERE.

04:03.774 --> 04:05.316
HE WAS THE ONLY ONE
I KNEW WITH POWER TOOLS,

04:05.316 --> 04:06.917
PLUS HE'S GONNA TAKE THE HEAT
IF WE GET CAUGHT.

04:06.917 --> 04:08.619
YEAH, YOU CAN'T KICK ME
OUT OF COLLEGE TWICE.

04:08.619 --> 04:10.250
NOW WHAT'S THE PLAN, BOYS?

04:10.250 --> 04:12.983
WELL, I WAS THINKING
WE STEAL--
I'M IN.

04:12.983 --> 04:16.327
NOW WHAT ABOUT YOU GIRLS?
IT'S TIME TO SACK UP OR PACK UP.

04:19.330 --> 04:20.461
HERE YOU GO, MOM.

04:20.461 --> 04:21.832
MM, THANK YOU.

04:21.832 --> 04:23.394
DID YOU HAVE A NICE LUNCH

04:23.394 --> 04:25.396
WITH YOUR LITTLE
WHITE-TRASH SIDEKICK?

04:25.396 --> 04:26.837
MM-HMM.

04:26.837 --> 04:30.571
YOU KNOW, SHE EVEN SMELLS CHEAP,
LIKE MOONSHINE AND TACO MEAT.

04:30.571 --> 04:33.374
HEY! THERE'S MY PRETTY GIRL.

04:33.374 --> 04:36.046
AW.
YOU KNOW WHAT? I GOT YOU
A LITTLE ENGAGEMENT GIFT.

04:36.046 --> 04:37.848
AW.

04:39.049 --> 04:40.751
ARE YOU STILL
NOT TALKING TO ME?

04:41.982 --> 04:44.355
"NO, WE'RE TOTALLY COOL."

04:44.355 --> 04:46.517
WOW, I REGRET DOING THAT.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.521
I NEED A NAP.

04:50.521 --> 04:53.464
I HAVE BEEN PULLING
SERIOUS HOOKER HOURS

04:53.464 --> 04:55.596
WITH MY LATE-NIGHT BAKING.
YOU KNOW, WHATEVER.

04:55.596 --> 04:58.529
SMALL PRICE TO PAY FOR WORKING
ON YOUR LIFELONG DREAM, HUH?

05:00.030 --> 05:02.302
(mouths words)

05:02.302 --> 05:04.405
WHAT'S YOUR LIFELONG DREAM,
LAURIE?

05:04.405 --> 05:06.907
SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL,

05:06.907 --> 05:10.781
I HAVE WANTED
TO OWN A CAKE SHOP.

05:10.781 --> 05:12.312
I LOVE BAKING CAKES.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.944
HAVE I NEVER SHOWED YOU
PICTURES? DO YOU WANT TO SEE?

05:13.944 --> 05:15.486
NO.

05:15.486 --> 05:16.917
YES.
UM...

05:16.917 --> 05:19.520
HERE'S MY BUNNY CAKE.
THAT'S A GAYKE. GAYS LOVE CAKE.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.522
THERE'S A MERMAID CAKE,

05:21.522 --> 05:23.594
PREGNANT MERMAID
FOR BABY SHOWERS, PIE CAKE...

05:23.594 --> 05:24.925
PIE CAKE.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.927
UM, THERE'S MY PUPPY CAKE,
MY BRUCE WILLIS CAKE,

05:26.927 --> 05:29.500
ALAN RICKMAN CAKE--
I HAD JUST WATCHED "DIE HARD."

05:29.500 --> 05:32.403
UNICORN CAKE, BURRITO CAKE...
OH, AND THESE TINY ONES--

05:32.403 --> 05:34.405
THEY'RE BOOB-SHAPED CUPCAKES.

05:34.405 --> 05:35.936
I THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD
SELL TWICE AS FAST BECAUSE

05:35.936 --> 05:39.370
IT WOULD BE WEIRD FOR SOMEONE TO
COME IN AND JUST BUY ONE, RIGHT?

05:39.370 --> 05:42.873
I HAVE MORE IN MY BAG--
PICTURES. HOLD ON.

05:42.873 --> 05:44.445
ALL RIGHT. SO...

05:44.445 --> 05:46.847
HOW COULD YOU NOT
BELIEVE ME ABOUT MY MOM?

05:46.847 --> 05:48.719
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

05:48.719 --> 05:51.452
ALL I ASK IS THAT
YOU HAVE BLIND FAITH IN ME

05:51.452 --> 05:52.683
AND THAT YOU HIT ME
WITH A SHOVEL

05:52.683 --> 05:54.885
IF I EVER GOT A TOE RING.
FINE.

05:54.885 --> 05:57.428
IF YOU SAY SHE'S THE DEVIL,
THEN ALL RIGHT, SHE'S THE DEVIL.

05:57.428 --> 05:58.729
(door opens)
(Betsy)
SORRY IT'S NOT WRAPPED.

05:58.729 --> 05:59.730
(whispers) ALL RIGHT...

05:59.730 --> 06:01.091
OW! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:01.091 --> 06:03.564
SHOWING YOU HELL.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.065
JULES HAD TO LEAVE.

06:05.065 --> 06:06.597
UNGRATEFUL LITTLE BITCH.

06:06.597 --> 06:10.040
SHE'D RUIN THIS SCARF ANYWAY
WITH THAT TACKY BLACK HAIR DYE.

06:10.040 --> 06:13.674
WITH ALL THAT EYELINER,
GOD FORBID SHE STARTS CRYING.

06:13.674 --> 06:16.407
SHE'D LOOK
LIKE ALICE COOPER.

06:16.407 --> 06:19.009
PROBABLY.

06:20.651 --> 06:22.913
(voice breaking)
WHO'S ALICE COOPER?

06:22.913 --> 06:24.054
(whispers) DON'T.

06:24.054 --> 06:26.717
WAS SHE PRETTY?

06:30.421 --> 06:31.622
I DON'T REMEMBER A TIME

06:31.622 --> 06:33.994
I EVER FELT GOOD ABOUT MYSELF
AFTER BEING AROUND MY MOM.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.727
SWEETIE, YOU'RE NOT
ONLY MY SOUL MATE.

06:36.727 --> 06:39.099
YOU'RE MY MORAL COMPASS.

06:39.099 --> 06:43.674
JUST TELL ME, DO I REALLY
NEED TO KEEP HER IN MY LIFE?

06:43.674 --> 06:45.536
IT'S A TOUGHIE BECAUSE--

06:45.536 --> 06:46.537
I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU.

06:46.537 --> 06:48.609
SERIOUSLY, DUDE?
SORRY. MY BAD.

06:48.609 --> 06:51.782
YES. SHE STAYS IN YOUR LIFE.
THAT'S HOW FAMILY WORKS.

06:51.782 --> 06:53.644
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
GOOD ABOUT HER.

06:53.644 --> 06:58.118
UNTRUE. SHE'S 66 AND STILL HOT.
THAT BODES WELL FOR ME.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.490
(chuckles)

06:59.490 --> 07:00.891
KEEP MOVING.

07:02.523 --> 07:06.457
I CAN'T REMEMBER ONE NICE THING
SHE'S EVER SAID TO ME.

07:06.457 --> 07:08.759
MAYBE SHE JUST CAN'T
SAY IT TO YOUR FACE.

07:08.759 --> 07:10.701
WHATEVER. I DON'T CARE.

07:10.701 --> 07:13.103
OH. WELL, SEE,
NOW I KNOW YOU CARE.

07:13.103 --> 07:16.166
THAT'S YOUR TELL--
HITTING THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE.

07:16.166 --> 07:19.169
I MEAN, MOST PEOPLE USE WORDS,
BUT IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

07:19.169 --> 07:20.841
NOW DO YOU WANT ME
TO GET YOUR MOM

07:20.841 --> 07:22.643
TO SAY SOMETHING NICE
ABOUT YOU?

07:22.643 --> 07:23.674
I DON'T CARE.

07:23.674 --> 07:25.115
STOP IT.

07:25.115 --> 07:27.718
YES, PLEASE.

07:30.721 --> 07:32.723
WHAT? WE'RE STEALING
THE COUGAR STATUE?

07:32.723 --> 07:34.124
YEAH!

07:34.124 --> 07:36.657
WE'RE JUST CASING IT FOR NOW,
OKAY? SO ACT NATURAL.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.629
HEY.

07:38.629 --> 07:41.191
(sighs)

07:41.191 --> 07:43.864
DAD, WHAT, ARE YOU
FAKE HACKY-SACKING?

07:43.864 --> 07:45.666
GOT A GOOD VOLLEY
GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.037
WHY DOES THIS SCHOOL
EVEN HAVE A COUGAR?

07:47.037 --> 07:48.899
NOTHING HERE HAS ANYTHING
TO DO WITH COUGARS.

07:48.899 --> 07:50.470
WHO CARES?

07:50.470 --> 07:52.202
IF WE STEAL IT, OUR HOUSE
WILL FINALLY BE THE PARTY HOUSE

07:52.202 --> 07:53.604
AND NOT JUST THE HOUSE

07:53.604 --> 07:55.676
WHERE THAT DENTAL STUDENT
BLEW HIS HEAD OFF.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.648
YOUR HOUSE IS HAUNTED
BY A GHOST DENTIST?

07:57.648 --> 08:00.480
I'M SCARED
OF BOTH OF THOSE THINGS.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.482
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S A BIG-ASS CAT,

08:02.482 --> 08:04.715
SO I CALLED IN A MAN
WITH A TRUCK. COME HERE.

08:04.715 --> 08:06.156
HOWDY, TRAV.

08:06.156 --> 08:07.958
GRANDPA.

08:07.958 --> 08:10.591
LOOK, I APPRECIATE
YOU WANTING TO HELP,

08:10.591 --> 08:12.993
BUT WE'RE GONNA DO
SOME PRETTY SHADY STUFF.

08:12.993 --> 08:16.096
I'M NOT QUITE SURE
IT'S UP YOUR AL--OH!

08:16.096 --> 08:17.998
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
WHAT THE HELL?

08:17.998 --> 08:18.999
(man) HEY!

08:18.999 --> 08:21.572
BE COOL, BOYS.
BE COOL.

08:21.572 --> 08:23.133
THEY WENT THAT WAY.

08:23.133 --> 08:24.174
THANKS.

08:25.235 --> 08:28.208
THEY NEVER SUSPECT
THE OLD GUY.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.640
ROLO?

08:29.640 --> 08:31.081
OH, YEAH.

08:32.913 --> 08:34.084
OKAY.

08:34.084 --> 08:37.648
SINCE YOU RECENTLY
FOUND OUT YOU'RE A DAD,

08:37.648 --> 08:39.890
I BAKED YOU A "CONGRATS
ON YOUR BABY THAT YOU HAD

08:39.890 --> 08:41.722
"WITH THE DRUNK GIRL
THAT YOU PICKED UP AT YOUR BAR

08:41.722 --> 08:43.594
BEFORE YOU STARTED DATING JULES"
CAKE.

08:43.594 --> 08:45.025
в™Є TA-DA в™Є

08:45.025 --> 08:49.560
AND IT'S A LADYBUG, WHICH IS
RELEVANT IN... ZERO WAYS.

08:49.560 --> 08:51.702
I WAS GONNA BAKE
A RED VELVET BABY,

08:51.702 --> 08:55.806
BUT THEN I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE
WEIRD TO EAT YOUR OWN BABY.

08:55.806 --> 08:59.970
I HAD A HAMSTER THAT DID THAT
ONCE. IT WAS SO SUPER GROSS...

08:59.970 --> 09:02.142
(whispers)
BUT I COULD NOT LOOK AWAY.

09:02.142 --> 09:05.616
(normal voice, laughs)
NATURE.

09:05.616 --> 09:08.749
OH! I GOTTA GO.
I'M LATE FOR WORK.

09:08.749 --> 09:12.222
(laughing)

09:12.222 --> 09:15.255
WORK.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.757
ARE YOU HAPPY?

09:16.757 --> 09:18.258
THANKS TO YOU,
I'VE BEEN THE TARGET

09:18.258 --> 09:20.791
OF LAURIE'S MOUTH CANNON
FOR TWO DAYS STRAIGHT.

09:20.791 --> 09:25.235
"CAKE. CAKE. GIANT JEWELRY.
HOT BLACK GUYS. CAKE."

09:25.235 --> 09:27.567
POOR GRAYSON. YOUR LIFE
IS JUST LIKE A BLUES SONG.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.970
в™Є BA-DA-DA DA-DA,
MY THOUGHTFUL FRIENDS в™Є

09:29.970 --> 09:32.703
в™Є DA-DA-DA DA-DA,
BRING ME LADYBUG CAKE в™Є

09:32.703 --> 09:33.804
(man) AH, GOOD.

09:33.804 --> 09:36.807
YOU FINALLY SERVE DESSERTS HERE.
I'LL HAVE A PIECE.

09:36.807 --> 09:37.948
UH, THAT'S NOT FOR SALE.

09:37.948 --> 09:39.750
COME ON! SELL THE CAKE.

09:39.750 --> 09:42.813
YOU'LL BE A DREAM-MAKER
LIKE, UH, SIMON COWELL.

09:42.813 --> 09:43.814
I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT.

09:43.814 --> 09:45.616
I'LL GIVE YOU 10 BUCKS
FOR A SLICE.

09:45.616 --> 09:47.888
DONE. LET'S MAKE
SOME DREAMS HAPPEN.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.321
MOM!

09:51.321 --> 09:53.794
FREE WINE OVER HERE!
COME OVER!

09:53.794 --> 09:55.926
OH, GREAT.

09:55.926 --> 09:57.798
IF YOU WANT HER
TO TRUST YOU AND OPEN UP,

09:57.798 --> 09:59.329
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
BE AS MEAN AS SHE IS.

09:59.329 --> 10:01.772
I CAN BE JUNKYARD NASTY,
BITCH.

10:01.772 --> 10:04.174
I'M SORRY.
YOU'RE SO PRETTY.

10:04.174 --> 10:07.908
FAIL. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
CRANK THAT "MEAN" DIAL WAY UP.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.810
I CAN DO THIS. WINE ME.

10:09.810 --> 10:10.811
ALL RIGHT.

10:10.811 --> 10:11.812
MM.

10:11.812 --> 10:14.785
MMM. (gargles)

10:14.785 --> 10:16.987
WELL, THAT'S A WASTE.
LISTEN.

10:16.987 --> 10:18.088
(whispers) YEAH.

10:18.088 --> 10:19.720
ONCE YOU ENTER
HER WORLD...
MM.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.051
IT'S HARD
TO STOP BEING MEAN.

10:21.051 --> 10:22.993
I MEAN, IT'S A MIRACLE
I CAN CONTROL IT.

10:22.993 --> 10:24.154
YOU THINK YOU CONTROL IT?

10:24.154 --> 10:25.696
I'M CONTROLLING IT NOW.

10:25.696 --> 10:26.697
(door opens)
HERE SHE COMES.

10:26.697 --> 10:28.659
OH.
(door closes)

10:28.659 --> 10:29.660
HEY.

10:29.660 --> 10:30.861
HI.

10:30.861 --> 10:31.862
WHERE DID ELLIE GO?

10:31.862 --> 10:33.934
OH, UM...
TO CHECK ON STAN.

10:33.934 --> 10:37.808
YOU KNOW, I STOLE THIS BOTTLE
OF WINE FROM GRAYSON'S BAR.

10:37.808 --> 10:39.269
DON'T TELL ON ME.

10:39.269 --> 10:41.842
GRAYSON CAN BE
A BIT OF A CHEAPSKATE.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.073
COULD BE WORSE.

10:44.374 --> 10:46.646
(whispers) CRANK UP.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.679
GRAYSON IS
A SELF-CENTERED PRETTY BOY

10:48.679 --> 10:51.852
WITH A BASTARD CHILD
AND EYES SO TINY,

10:51.852 --> 10:54.825
YOU COULD BLINDFOLD HIM
WITH A BEAD NECKLACE.

10:54.825 --> 10:56.656
JULES...

10:56.656 --> 10:58.058
YOU'RE AWFUL.

10:58.058 --> 10:59.429
I REALLY AM.

10:59.429 --> 11:02.262
(whispers) OKAY.

11:02.262 --> 11:06.296
SHE'S IN.
(whispers) HIGH FIVE. AWESOME.

11:06.296 --> 11:08.899
HEY. NICE HORSE TRAILER.

11:08.899 --> 11:11.271
I CONCEIVED YOUR MOM
IN THERE.

11:11.271 --> 11:13.173
THERE'S THE FIRST SCAR
OF THE NIGHT.

11:13.173 --> 11:17.447
HEY, IT'LL HOLD A STATUE.
NOW LISTEN.

11:17.447 --> 11:21.681
EVERYBODY STICK TO THE PLAN,
AND NOBODY'S GONNA GET PINCHED.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.053
WHOA.
YOU BROUGHT A GUN?

11:23.053 --> 11:25.415
WELL, YOU BRING A GUN
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE A GUN.

11:25.415 --> 11:26.857
WHAT?

11:26.857 --> 11:29.860
(click)
I'M JUST MAKING SURE
IT'S NOT LOADED.

11:30.791 --> 11:31.792
(blusters)

11:31.792 --> 11:34.865
HEY. THERE'S A HORSE
IN HERE.

11:34.865 --> 11:35.966
YOU FORGOT
TO UNLOAD ANNABELLE?

11:35.966 --> 11:39.229
YEAH. I'M OLD.
COULD WE JUST DO THIS?

11:39.229 --> 11:40.971
UH-OH. SIG'S STRESSED.

11:40.971 --> 11:42.102
LET'S GO HOME.

11:42.102 --> 11:44.234
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
THIS IS OUR MOMENT.

11:44.234 --> 11:46.406
WE CAN'T JUST RUN AWAY
AT THE FIRST SIGN OF--
(door opens and closes)

11:46.406 --> 11:49.179
SCATTER. SCATTER.

11:49.179 --> 11:51.812
ROOKIES.

11:52.913 --> 11:56.086
IT'S JUST A SURPRISE.
NO ONE'S GONNA HIT YOU.

11:56.086 --> 11:57.087
(high-pitched voice) BOOP.

11:57.087 --> 11:59.389
CHECK OUT MY NEW MENU.

11:59.389 --> 12:01.321
KRAZY KAKES! HUH?

12:02.853 --> 12:05.856
EVEN BOUGHT A NEW OVEN.

12:05.856 --> 12:07.928
YOU'LL MAKE THE CAKES HERE,
I'LL SELL THEM,

12:07.928 --> 12:09.930
AND WE'LL SPLIT THE PROFITS.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.962
(high-pitched laugh)

12:11.962 --> 12:12.903
YEAH!

12:12.903 --> 12:14.805
SHE'S NOT DOING IT WITH ME.

12:14.805 --> 12:18.168
GRAYSON, THIS IS REALLY SWEET,
BUT I'M NOT INTERESTED.

12:18.168 --> 12:19.739
SORRY.

12:19.739 --> 12:20.740
(chuckles)

12:22.272 --> 12:25.946
HOW ABOUT YOU GIVE ME
A 1-SECOND HEAD START

12:25.946 --> 12:28.148
FOR EVERY HUNDRED DOLLARS
THAT YOU SPENT ON HER?

12:28.148 --> 12:31.181
SO THAT WOULD BE WHAT,
LIKE, THREE, FOUR SECONDS?

12:31.181 --> 12:32.382
11.

12:32.382 --> 12:35.886
THAT'S--THAT'S
A LOT OF SECONDS.

12:38.859 --> 12:42.132
MY FIRST HUSBAND
WAS THE RARE TRIPLE THREAT.

12:42.132 --> 12:43.834
HE COMBINED ALCOHOLISM

12:43.834 --> 12:46.396
AND NO PERSONALITY
WITH SEVERE UGLINESS.

12:46.396 --> 12:49.199
(chuckles) ONCE THE CASH
WAS GONE, SO WAS I.

12:49.199 --> 12:50.370
THOSE MAY BE
THE DARKEST THOUGHTS

12:50.370 --> 12:52.943
I'VE EVER HEARD
STRUNG TOGETHER.

12:52.943 --> 12:54.905
HE WAS ELLIE'S DAD,
YOU KNOW.

12:54.905 --> 12:57.978
SHE DEFINITELY MADE IT HARDER
TO MEET HUSBAND NUMBER TWO.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.080
OH, BETS. (chuckles)

13:00.080 --> 13:02.212
YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER.

13:02.212 --> 13:03.884
YOU KNOW,
IT'S A FUNNY THING ABOUT KIDS.

13:03.884 --> 13:05.785
YOU RAISE THEM,
PROVIDE FOR THEM--

13:05.785 --> 13:08.358
YOU DO YOUR JOB AS A PARENT
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO.

13:08.358 --> 13:12.492
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THERE'LL BE
ANY REAL CONNECTION, YOU KNOW.

13:12.492 --> 13:16.927
IF YOU HAD TO SAY SOMETHING NICE
ABOUT ELLIE, YOU COULD.

13:16.927 --> 13:20.300
COME ON. GUN TO YOUR HEAD.
SAY SOMETHING.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.032
(singsongy)
UH-OH. I'M COCKING IT.

13:22.032 --> 13:23.403
(makes clicking noise)

13:23.403 --> 13:25.175
HUH.

13:25.175 --> 13:26.336
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.

13:26.336 --> 13:27.838
GOOD NIGHT.

13:27.838 --> 13:29.880
(glass clatters)

13:30.981 --> 13:34.044
HEY, STAN. IS THAT MINE?

13:35.085 --> 13:36.116
AS YOU WERE.

13:41.892 --> 13:43.153
WOW.

13:43.153 --> 13:45.055
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE'S BEEN
SUCKING DOWN SOME SALT TODAY,

13:45.055 --> 13:46.596
HUH? BLOAT MUCH?

13:46.596 --> 13:48.058
(blows air)
MEAN,

13:48.058 --> 13:50.360
BUT GOOD EYE,
'CAUSE I SCARFED DOWN, LIKE,

13:50.360 --> 13:53.303
TWO MONSTER SOFT PRETZELS
ON MY WAY OVER HERE.

13:53.303 --> 13:54.604
I'M SORRY.

13:54.604 --> 13:56.406
IT'S JUST, WHEN THAT MEANNESS
GETS A HOLD OF YOU,

13:56.406 --> 13:58.969
IT'S LIKE,
IT JUST FEELS SO GOOD.

13:58.969 --> 14:00.110
MM-HMM.
IT'S LIKE A DRUG,

14:00.110 --> 14:03.113
BUT YOU DON'T SEE FIREWORKS
OR CARTOON PONIES.

14:03.113 --> 14:05.075
JULES HAS NEVER TRIED DRUGS.

14:05.075 --> 14:09.449
CLEARLY. SO... DID MY MOM
SAY ANYTHING NICE ABOUT ME?

14:09.449 --> 14:11.051
NOT THAT I CARE.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.052
OW!

14:12.052 --> 14:14.124
(chuckles)
SHE DID. SHE, UH...

14:14.124 --> 14:17.057
SHE SAID THAT, UH,
THAT YOU'RE A GREAT MOM.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.128
CAN I GET A DIRECT QUOTE?

14:18.128 --> 14:19.359
"ELLIE'S A GREAT MOM."

14:19.359 --> 14:21.932
WOW. THAT'S...

14:21.932 --> 14:23.333
WOW.

14:23.333 --> 14:26.296
THANKS, JULES.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.969
I AM SUCH A LIAR.

14:28.969 --> 14:29.970
OH.

14:29.970 --> 14:33.243
PRETZEL?

14:33.243 --> 14:34.304
BYE.

14:34.304 --> 14:36.076
(exhales deeply)

14:36.076 --> 14:39.079
I SHOULD HAVE ASKED YOU
IF YOU WANTED TO SELL CAKES.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.210
OKAY?
BUT I'VE LEARNED MY LESSON.

14:40.210 --> 14:43.253
I WILL NEVER
LISTEN TO ANDY AGAIN.

14:43.253 --> 14:44.915
AND I LEARNED TWO LESSONS--

14:44.915 --> 14:47.918
ONE, GRAYSON'S
A LOT FASTER THAN HE LOOKS,

14:47.918 --> 14:51.421
AND TWO, HE STILL
THINKS WEDGIES ARE FUNNY.

14:51.421 --> 14:54.124
(chuckles) 'CAUSE THEY ARE.

14:54.124 --> 14:56.266
ANDY, WHY DON'T YOU JUST
PULL THAT THING DOWN?

14:56.266 --> 14:57.327
THEY DON'T GO DOWN.

14:57.327 --> 14:59.169
THEY'RE IN ME.

14:59.169 --> 15:02.102
OH.
YOU'RE CRAZY
NOT TO SELL YOUR CAKES,

15:02.102 --> 15:06.506
AND I'M NOT JUST SAYING THAT
BECAUSE I'M $1,100 IN THE HOLE.

15:06.506 --> 15:07.677
I DON'T CARE.

15:07.677 --> 15:09.179
UH, DON'T SAY,
"I DON'T CARE,"

15:09.179 --> 15:11.311
BECAUSE IT MAKES ME
A LITTLE, UH, RAGE-Y.

15:11.311 --> 15:12.312
I DON'T CARE. (sighs)

15:12.312 --> 15:13.984
THERE IT IS AGAIN.
I DON'T CARE.

15:13.984 --> 15:16.686
THAT'S IT. I AM TAKING THAT CAKE
AND I'M GONNA SELL IT.

15:16.686 --> 15:18.488
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
DON'T TOUCH IT.

15:18.488 --> 15:19.919
I'LL TOUCH IT.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.051
NO, YOU'RE NOT. GRAYSON...
ALL RIGHT. GUYS, G--

15:21.051 --> 15:22.352
PUT IT DOWN RIGHT NOW.
NO.

15:22.352 --> 15:23.523
GET $1,100--

15:23.523 --> 15:24.524
(all yelling)

15:24.524 --> 15:27.197
I DON'T CARE! I--

15:27.197 --> 15:28.658
(sighs)

15:31.361 --> 15:34.064
I'M STILL SELLING THIS!

15:34.064 --> 15:35.335
(chuckles)

15:35.335 --> 15:38.308
THIS IS PERFECTLY GOOD.
I'M STILL SELLING THIS!

15:40.140 --> 15:41.671
YOU KNOW,
BEFORE THE COUGAR STATUE,

15:41.671 --> 15:43.343
THEY USED TO HAVE
A SERIES OF BRONZE SCULPTURES

15:43.343 --> 15:46.046
DEPICTING FAMOUS BATTLE SCENES
FROM THE CIVIL WAR.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.217
THAT'S A GREAT STORY.

15:47.217 --> 15:49.019
DON'T BE LIKE
YOUR SCAREDY-CAT BUDDIES.

15:49.019 --> 15:50.350
THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE AFRAID OF.

15:50.350 --> 15:51.351
GHOST DENTIST!

15:51.351 --> 15:52.352
(both) AAH!
(horse whinnies)

15:52.352 --> 15:53.483
DAD, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

15:53.483 --> 15:55.325
WAIT. WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING HERE, ANYWAY?

15:55.325 --> 15:57.257
WE'RE STEALING--
I'M IN!

15:57.257 --> 16:00.330
I LOVE IT WHEN
WE DO THINGS AS A FAMILY.

16:00.330 --> 16:01.461
HEY!

16:01.461 --> 16:03.363
IS THAT THE FUZZ?

16:03.363 --> 16:04.694
EVERYBODY GO
CIVIL WAR STATUE.

16:06.296 --> 16:10.270
(blustering)

16:10.270 --> 16:12.342
SERIOUSLY?

16:14.304 --> 16:16.206
AND HERE IS YOUR MUG CAKE.

16:16.206 --> 16:19.279
OH, IS--THAT'S
WHY YOU CALLED ME HERE?

16:19.279 --> 16:21.181
TO RUB THAT IN MY FACE?
THAT'S COOL.

16:21.181 --> 16:24.554
LAURIE, I KNOW WHY YOU BAILED
ON ME. YOU'RE SCARED.

16:24.554 --> 16:27.187
LAURIE KELLER ISN'T
SCARED OF ANYTHING...

16:27.187 --> 16:30.220
EXCEPT FOR OLD PEOPLE
SMILING AT ME.

16:30.220 --> 16:33.293
I SWEAR IT'S LIKE
THEY WANT TO STEAL YOUR SOUL.

16:33.293 --> 16:34.694
IT'S OKAY TO BE AFRAID.

16:34.694 --> 16:37.227
NOT OF OLD PEOPLE.
THAT'S INSANE.

16:37.227 --> 16:39.229
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE MOST
ABOUT MYSELF, GRAYSON?

16:39.229 --> 16:41.031
I MEAN, BESIDES EVERYTHING?

16:41.031 --> 16:43.233
IT'S THAT I KNOW WHO I AM.

16:43.233 --> 16:45.205
I'M A HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT
WHO WORKS A BORING JOB

16:45.205 --> 16:48.378
AND GETS PAID JUST ENOUGH MONEY
TO BUY REALLY LOUD CLOTHES.

16:48.378 --> 16:50.180
AND I'M FINE WITH THAT

16:50.180 --> 16:54.484
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT ONE DAY,
I'M GONNA RUN KRAZY KAKES.

16:54.484 --> 16:58.388
BUT... YOU GET THAT
IF I TRY AND I FAIL,

16:58.388 --> 17:01.621
THEN THERE'S
NO MORE "ONE DAY," RIGHT?

17:01.621 --> 17:05.755
MY BIGGEST DREAM
WAS TO HAVE A KID. NOW I DO.

17:05.755 --> 17:07.297
AW.

17:07.297 --> 17:10.360
LOOK, NOT EVERYTHING WITH JILL'S
HOW I IMAGINED IT'D BE.

17:10.360 --> 17:11.731
ISN'T HER NAME TAMPA?

17:11.731 --> 17:13.503
HER FIRST NAME IS TAMPA.

17:13.503 --> 17:16.206
HER MIDDLE NAME IS JILL,
AND I'M GOING WITH "JILL."

17:16.206 --> 17:17.237
WHY?

17:17.237 --> 17:18.408
THE POINT IS

17:18.408 --> 17:20.610
IT'S AMAZING
HAVING JILL IN MY LIFE.

17:20.610 --> 17:22.742
THE REALITY'S BETTER
THAN THE DREAMS EVER WERE,

17:22.742 --> 17:24.744
AND YOU'LL NEVER KNOW
IF THAT'S TRUE FOR YOU

17:24.744 --> 17:26.576
UNLESS YOU ROLL THE DICE.

17:26.576 --> 17:28.318
GRAYSON...

17:29.349 --> 17:30.650
(inhales sharply)

17:30.650 --> 17:32.322
(whimpers)

17:32.322 --> 17:35.155
ROY. ROY, GO BACK TO YOUR TABLE.
OKAY? I'LL BRING YOU A BEER.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.826
(sighs)

17:36.826 --> 17:40.260
THANKS, NEW GUY.

17:40.260 --> 17:43.463
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S SELL SOME CAKES.

17:43.463 --> 17:45.695
RIGHT. (chuckles) AH.

17:45.695 --> 17:48.098
YOU NEED TO REALLY WORK
ON THAT NOSEBLEED, SIG.

17:48.098 --> 17:49.499
THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T
HAVE A GIRLFRIEND, MAN.
I'M SORRY, MAN.

17:49.499 --> 17:50.700
'CAUSE YOU ALWAYS
GOT NOSEBLEEDS.

17:50.700 --> 17:52.302
I TOLD YOU--
NO WAY.

17:52.302 --> 17:53.703
YOU GUYS GOT IT.
YEP,

17:53.703 --> 17:57.076
PLUS I LEARNED SOMETHING
THAT'S GONNA HELP US IN COLLEGE.

17:57.076 --> 18:01.111
CAMPUS COPS WILL FORGET
ANYTHING FOR 20 BUCKS.

18:01.111 --> 18:02.112
THEY WILL.

18:02.112 --> 18:03.483
BOYS, LET'S GO CELEBRATE.

18:03.483 --> 18:05.385
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU
HOW TO SCORE FREE PIZZA.

18:05.385 --> 18:07.517
WHO WANTS TO FAKE-CHOKE
ON A SAUSAGE?

18:07.517 --> 18:08.558
OOH, I'M IN.

18:08.558 --> 18:11.121
JUNE BUG.
DIDN'T YOU WANT TO TALK?

18:11.121 --> 18:13.463
(door opens)
DAD, YOU NEVER
LET ME DO ANYTHING.

18:13.463 --> 18:16.095
(door closes)
I LET YOU COMMIT
A FELONY TONIGHT.

18:17.467 --> 18:18.868
NOW WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

18:18.868 --> 18:20.470
ALL RIGHT.

18:20.470 --> 18:23.333
ELLIE'S MOM
IS JUST SO AWFUL,

18:23.333 --> 18:26.136
AND I KNOW YOU CAN'T
CLOSE THE DOOR ON FAMILY, BUT--

18:26.136 --> 18:27.477
HORSE FEATHERS.

18:27.477 --> 18:29.279
DO YOU THINK
BOBBY AND I ENJOYED

18:29.279 --> 18:31.411
HELPING TRAVIS
STEAL THAT STATUE?

18:31.411 --> 18:33.483
I DO.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT WAS AWESOME.

18:33.483 --> 18:34.644
(both chuckle)

18:34.644 --> 18:37.387
BUT EVEN IT HAD STUNK,
WE STILL WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE,

18:37.387 --> 18:39.449
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WE LOVE
NEED TO KNOW

18:39.449 --> 18:41.651
THAT WE'RE ALWAYS
ON THEIR SIDE.

18:41.651 --> 18:43.393
YOU DON'T GET A FREE PASS

18:43.393 --> 18:45.725
JUST BECAUSE
YOU SHARE THE SAME BLOOD.

18:45.725 --> 18:49.599
BEING PART OF A FAMILY'S
SOMETHING YOU GOT TO EARN.

18:49.599 --> 18:51.761
OTHERWISE, THE HELL WITH YOU.

18:51.761 --> 18:54.334
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE MY DAD.
(pats leg)

18:54.334 --> 18:56.236
AW.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.208
YOU GUYS WANT TO GET HIGH?

18:58.208 --> 18:59.209
NO.

18:59.209 --> 19:01.341
GET OUT.

19:02.412 --> 19:03.843
WHERE'S YOUR MOM?

19:03.843 --> 19:07.747
PACKING. CAR'S COMING
TO TAKE HER TO THE AIRPORT.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.419
(Paddy Casey's "Everybody Wants"
playing)

19:09.419 --> 19:10.420
I GET BIG CARL?

19:10.420 --> 19:11.421
MM-HMM.

19:11.421 --> 19:14.153
WHAT'S GOING ON?
ARE YOU DYING?

19:15.225 --> 19:17.757
ELLIE, I LIED,
AND I NEVER LIE.

19:17.757 --> 19:18.928
YOU ALWAYS LIE.
I DON'T.

19:18.928 --> 19:21.231
YOU DO.
FINE, BUT NEVER
ABOUT BIG STUFF.

19:21.231 --> 19:22.262
USUALLY ABOUT BIG STUFF.

19:22.262 --> 19:23.393
I THINK WE'RE
GETTING SIDETRACKED.

19:23.393 --> 19:27.597
LISTEN, YOUR MOM DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING NICE ABOUT YOU.

19:27.597 --> 19:29.399
I'M SO SORRY.

19:29.399 --> 19:31.241
I THINK,
DEEP DOWN, I KNEW.

19:31.241 --> 19:32.572
WELL, I DO HAVE
SOME GOOD NEWS.

19:32.572 --> 19:35.905
AS YOUR MORAL COMPASS,
I'M FREEING YOU.

19:35.905 --> 19:38.378
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEE HER
ANYMORE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

19:38.378 --> 19:39.549
AWESOME!

19:39.549 --> 19:40.550
WHOA.

19:40.550 --> 19:42.552
DIDN'T EXPECT YOU
TO BE THIS EXCITED.

19:42.552 --> 19:44.314
CAN I GET
A DEAD-MOM HIGH FIVE?

19:44.314 --> 19:46.556
MORBID, BUT ALL RIGHT,
IF YOU REALLY WANT ONE.

19:46.556 --> 19:49.959
OH, I WANT ONE. I WANT TWO.
DEAD. MOM-FIVE.

19:49.959 --> 19:52.422
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?

19:52.422 --> 19:53.393
DON'T WORRY.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.495
I HONESTLY DON'T CARE
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER

19:55.495 --> 19:57.597
IF I EVER SEE MY MOM AGAIN.

19:57.597 --> 19:59.569
OH.

19:59.569 --> 20:02.432
WELL, MAYBE
BY CUTTING HER OUT,

20:02.432 --> 20:05.305
SHE'LL REALIZE
THAT SHE NEEDS TO CHANGE.

20:05.305 --> 20:06.576
YOU THINK SHE WILL?

20:06.576 --> 20:07.577
I HOPE SO.

20:07.577 --> 20:08.638
(Betsy) ELLIE!

20:08.638 --> 20:09.909
THE CAR'S HERE.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.481
I'M GONNA HEAD OUT NOW
SO I HAVE TIME

20:11.481 --> 20:13.243
TO BUY MAGAZINES
AT THE AIRPORT.

20:13.243 --> 20:14.944
OKAY, MOM. I'LL COME OVER
AND SAY GOOD-BYE.

20:14.944 --> 20:16.586
NO, NO, THAT'S OKAY.

20:16.586 --> 20:20.490
THANKS FOR THE VISIT.
I'M SURE WE'LL TALK SOON.

20:20.490 --> 20:23.623
BYE, MOM.

20:24.624 --> 20:26.426
WANT A HUG?

20:26.426 --> 20:30.600
в™Є 'CAUSE EVERYBODY WANTS
TO FEEL NEEDED SOMETIMES в™Є

20:30.600 --> 20:32.432
(whispers) I DON'T LIE.

20:32.432 --> 20:33.603
YOU DO.

20:33.603 --> 20:34.964
SO MUCH.

20:34.964 --> 20:36.235
NEVER.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.407
YOU LIE ALL THE TIME.

20:37.407 --> 20:38.668
I DON'T WANT TO LIE.

20:38.668 --> 20:42.612
NEVER MET SOMEONE
THAT LIES AS MUCH AS YOU.

20:45.014 --> 20:47.547
OKAY. MM-HMM.

20:47.547 --> 20:48.678
WAIT.

20:48.678 --> 20:50.880
SINCE ELLIE'S MOM
COULDN'T DO IT,

20:50.880 --> 20:54.424
NO ONE GETS ANY WINE UNTIL YOU
SAY SOMETHING NICE ABOUT ELLIE.

20:54.424 --> 20:56.456
(glass clatters)
I'M GOING TO A BAR.

20:56.456 --> 20:58.257
OKAY.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.960
YOU ARE STRONG, YOU'RE SMART,
AND YOU'RE AN AMAZING FRIEND.
(door opens)

21:00.960 --> 21:03.363
AND I GET WINE.
(door closes)

21:03.363 --> 21:05.565
OH, AND YOU'RE ALSO PRETTY
AND YOU'RE FUNNY.

21:05.565 --> 21:07.867
AND YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL
AND YOU MAKE ME LAUGH.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.299
THOSE ARE
THE SAME THINGS I SAID.

21:09.299 --> 21:10.600
YOU TOOK ALL THE GOOD ONES.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.472
NO WINE FOR YOU!

21:12.472 --> 21:13.643
GRAYSON?

21:13.643 --> 21:17.307
OKAY, UM, YOU, UH,
YOU ARE A NEIGHBOR.

21:17.307 --> 21:18.348
A GOOD NEIGHBOR?

21:18.348 --> 21:19.309
EH.

21:19.309 --> 21:20.750
NO WINE FOR YOU!

21:20.750 --> 21:22.552
JUST MORE FOR US.
(chuckles)

21:23.983 --> 21:25.955
YOU OWN A TRUCK.

21:25.955 --> 21:27.317
(whispers) SAD.

21:27.317 --> 21:28.958
YOU STILL HAVE ALL YOUR FINGERS.

21:28.958 --> 21:30.360
(normal voice) WOW.
