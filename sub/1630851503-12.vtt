WEBVTT

00:05.092 --> 00:06.832
Morning.

00:06.876 --> 00:09.052
You still mad at me for putting
you back in public school?

00:09.096 --> 00:10.358
I'd love to talk,

00:10.401 --> 00:11.881
but my bullies don't like
to be kept waiting.

00:11.924 --> 00:13.839
They get cranky when they have
to rush through their insults

00:13.883 --> 00:15.015
to get to the hitting.

00:16.929 --> 00:19.497
Oh, there's a child
who still loves me.

00:19.541 --> 00:21.108
You still love me,
right?

00:23.327 --> 00:26.069
I do for a dollar.

00:26.113 --> 00:28.985
Uh, you're teaching her
to exchange love for money?

00:29.029 --> 00:31.118
You know, that ends with her
hanging out at a truck stop,

00:31.161 --> 00:32.597
and not because
she's driving.

00:33.816 --> 00:35.122
I have to go potty.

00:35.165 --> 00:38.995
Okay. Now, remember how much
toilet paper we use?

00:39.039 --> 00:40.170
This much.

00:41.345 --> 00:43.086
That much.

00:44.392 --> 00:47.786
So, being back in public school
isn't going so great?

00:47.830 --> 00:48.918
On the contrary.

00:48.961 --> 00:50.267
It's a real treat
being the kid

00:50.311 --> 00:51.442
who left to go
to magnet school

00:51.486 --> 00:53.227
and then had to
come crawling back.

00:53.270 --> 00:56.143
In hindsight, maybe
my last morning announcement

00:56.186 --> 00:58.145
on the PA system
shouldn't have been,

00:58.188 --> 01:02.323
"It's Taco Tuesday with
a side of kiss my ass, losers!"

01:02.366 --> 01:06.153
Man, you're a sitting duck
in gym class.

01:06.196 --> 01:08.155
Especially dodgeball.

01:08.198 --> 01:09.591
I loved that game.

01:09.634 --> 01:12.550
We had one kid,
we used to bean him so much,

01:12.594 --> 01:15.771
he had a bald spot on the back
of his head from running away.

01:17.207 --> 01:20.732
And the shame of that
has never left me.

01:20.776 --> 01:22.125
You know,
the best part is,

01:22.169 --> 01:24.562
I'm back in a school
with an 80% less chance

01:24.606 --> 01:26.173
of me getting
a scholarship.

01:26.216 --> 01:27.565
There's gotta be
another way.

01:27.609 --> 01:29.828
You should just drop out
and do homeschooling.

01:29.872 --> 01:31.178
Then you won't be forced

01:31.221 --> 01:34.311
to have all those
life-saving vaccines

01:34.355 --> 01:36.357
and you can make up
your own scientific theories

01:36.400 --> 01:38.185
like your favorite
athletes.

01:38.228 --> 01:40.143
Let me guess,
since I'm home anyway,

01:40.187 --> 01:42.014
I can watch your kid
while you're in class?

01:42.058 --> 01:44.147
Well,
there's a happy accident!

01:44.191 --> 01:46.367
I thought Emilio
watched Beverly Rose

01:46.410 --> 01:48.369
while you were
in class.

01:48.412 --> 01:50.284
His girlfriend's father
is in the hospital,

01:50.327 --> 01:53.156
so he went with her
to be supportive.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.550
I should have had a baby
with an inconsiderate jerk.

01:55.593 --> 01:58.205
You know,
like Darlene did.

01:58.248 --> 02:00.207
Can you watch
Beverly Rose?

02:00.250 --> 02:01.556
In the hardware store?

02:01.599 --> 02:03.732
We had a broken bag
of bird seed,

02:03.775 --> 02:07.344
and the rats were running around
like it's a Vegas buffet.

02:07.388 --> 02:10.565
I could give her a mallet.
She could play whack-a-mole.

02:10.608 --> 02:12.393
- Jackie?
- No, I don't know.

02:12.436 --> 02:14.003
There's gonna be a mob
at The Lunch Box.

02:14.046 --> 02:16.179
It's the day we give 10% off
to the seniors.

02:16.223 --> 02:17.398
That won't work.

02:17.441 --> 02:18.703
Beverly Rose
is in that phase

02:18.747 --> 02:20.966
where she's telling everybody
how they smell.

02:21.010 --> 02:23.230
And it's very hurtful.

02:23.273 --> 02:25.188
Come on, Darlene.

02:25.232 --> 02:26.885
I watched your kids.

02:26.929 --> 02:29.279
They only got away from me
once at the mall,

02:29.323 --> 02:32.369
and then I found them
right away in the park.

02:32.413 --> 02:35.894
How they crossed that
busy highway, I have no idea.

02:35.938 --> 02:37.418
I can't.

02:37.461 --> 02:40.203
I'm taking my last personal day
to look for a new place.

02:40.247 --> 02:41.987
So you're actually
moving out?

02:42.031 --> 02:44.642
She wants to be
independent from men.

02:44.686 --> 02:46.992
And as a man with
an overcrowded house,

02:47.036 --> 02:49.473
I say,
"Yaas, queen!"

02:52.172 --> 02:54.304
Can't you just miss
one day of class?

02:54.348 --> 02:55.610
I already missed two,

02:55.653 --> 02:58.569
and if I miss another one,
I get an Incomplete.

02:58.613 --> 03:00.919
I guess I'll just have to
bring her to class.

03:00.963 --> 03:03.313
Here's what you do --
and I've seen this work --

03:03.357 --> 03:05.359
you find two more kids,
you stack them on each other.

03:05.402 --> 03:07.274
You stick Beverly Rose
on top of them

03:07.317 --> 03:09.276
with a floor-length
trench coat and a hat,

03:09.319 --> 03:10.668
stick a mustache
on her.

03:10.712 --> 03:12.888
You saw that in
"The Little Rascals" movie.

03:12.931 --> 03:15.325
And it worked!
Cop ran right by 'em!

04:04.461 --> 04:08.160
Now, remember,
Mommy is in class,

04:08.204 --> 04:13.688
so you have to be <i>very</i> quiet
and watch your video, okay?

04:18.345 --> 04:20.434
Okay, today we're gonna
talk about

04:20.477 --> 04:23.175
the real reason you all
took Abnormal Psych --

04:23.219 --> 04:25.134
serial killers.

04:25.177 --> 04:29.094
Now, odds are, there's probably
one in this very classroom.

04:29.138 --> 04:31.009
I know who my money's on.

04:32.576 --> 04:35.536
♪ Old MacDonald
had a farm ♪

04:35.579 --> 04:37.581
♪ E-I-E-I-O

04:37.625 --> 04:40.497
♪ And on his farm,
he had a cow ♪

04:40.541 --> 04:43.152
♪ E-I-E-I-O

04:43.195 --> 04:46.329
Sorry, I was just thinking about
that serial killer farmer

04:46.373 --> 04:48.505
who made a wheelbarrow
out of a fat guy.

04:48.549 --> 04:51.334
Looks like we have
a new student here.

04:52.379 --> 04:53.815
I am so sorry.

04:53.858 --> 04:55.338
All my childcare
fell through.

04:55.382 --> 04:56.992
I didn't know
what else to do.

04:57.035 --> 04:59.342
It's okay. She's probably the
only one who did the reading.

05:01.388 --> 05:03.390
Well, hello,
Beverly Rose.

05:03.433 --> 05:05.043
My name's Professor Glen.

05:05.087 --> 05:07.350
You mom's told me
how smart you are.

05:07.394 --> 05:09.047
Would you like to
help me teach the class?

05:09.091 --> 05:10.745
Yes.

05:10.788 --> 05:12.007
Is that okay, Becky?

05:12.050 --> 05:14.357
Okay by me
if it's okay with you.

05:14.401 --> 05:15.489
It'll be fun.

05:15.532 --> 05:16.751
She can help me
with an experiment.

05:16.794 --> 05:18.579
You think she'd mind
a mild electric shock?

05:18.622 --> 05:19.362
What?

05:19.406 --> 05:20.711
Kidding.

05:20.755 --> 05:22.278
We can't do that
in the US anymore,

05:22.322 --> 05:24.541
but thank God for science,
there's international waters.

05:25.977 --> 05:27.762
Okay, you ready?

05:27.805 --> 05:30.591
Here we go. Oh.

05:30.634 --> 05:35.509
Everybody, please say hello
to my new TA, Beverly Rose.

05:35.552 --> 05:37.206
- Hi.
- Hi, Beverly Rose.

05:37.249 --> 05:38.816
Okay, now.

05:38.860 --> 05:40.731
Can you draw a triangle?

05:40.775 --> 05:41.776
I don't know.

05:41.819 --> 05:43.168
Let's try it.

05:43.212 --> 05:45.997
All you got to do is
connect the dots, okay?

05:46.041 --> 05:49.610
There you go.

05:49.653 --> 05:50.828
Yep.

05:50.872 --> 05:52.395
Ohp.

05:52.439 --> 05:53.962
Yep. Yep.

05:54.005 --> 05:55.224
There you go.

05:55.267 --> 05:58.401
Now, as Beverly Rose
has clearly illustrated,

05:58.445 --> 06:01.056
psychopathy, narcissism,
and Machiavellianism

06:01.099 --> 06:04.668
are the three personality traits
that make up the dark triad.

06:04.712 --> 06:06.409
And give it up for Beverly Rose!
Come on!

06:09.456 --> 06:11.458
So let's get back
to Old MacDonald.

06:11.501 --> 06:14.461
Can anybody here think of
any other children's songs

06:14.504 --> 06:16.332
that might apply to
abnormal psych?

06:16.376 --> 06:17.420
Uh...

06:17.464 --> 06:18.595
Becky?

06:18.639 --> 06:20.249
Well, it's not a song,

06:20.292 --> 06:24.645
but, uh, Humpty Dumpty clearly
suffered from suicidal ideation.

06:24.688 --> 06:27.256
I mean, he was
an egg up on a wall.

06:27.299 --> 06:28.475
Obviously,
he was a jumper.

06:30.085 --> 06:32.087
If you found Humpty with
a half a fifth of Scotch

06:32.130 --> 06:33.871
and an empty bottle of pills,
you wouldn't call

06:33.915 --> 06:36.265
all the king's horses
and all the king's men.

06:36.308 --> 06:37.484
You'd hit him up
with some NARCAN,

06:37.527 --> 06:39.050
put him back in the carton,

06:39.094 --> 06:41.096
and wait till
the ambulance got there.

06:44.708 --> 06:46.493
Hey, you here to get
the rest of your stuff

06:46.536 --> 06:47.711
to take to Aldo's?

06:47.755 --> 06:49.234
Yep.

06:49.278 --> 06:51.846
Well, I'll say it so that
you don't have to.

06:51.889 --> 06:53.587
"I've missed you every day,
Mom.

06:53.630 --> 06:56.633
Not just your wisdom
or your reassuring presence,

06:56.677 --> 06:58.461
but the warmth
that radiates from you

06:58.505 --> 06:59.636
like a second sun."

07:01.116 --> 07:02.509
Thought you'd enjoy that.

07:03.945 --> 07:06.904
So I heard you pulled Mark
out of the magnet school.

07:06.948 --> 07:08.471
What'd the little prince
do?

07:08.515 --> 07:11.518
Shank a stupid kid with
his National Honor Society pin?

07:11.561 --> 07:14.912
No, he was taking
Logan's ADHD medication.

07:14.956 --> 07:16.871
Whoa,
t-that's terrible.

07:16.914 --> 07:18.481
We should check his room
to see if he's hiding any.

07:18.525 --> 07:21.353
Don't bother.
He gave it all to me.

07:21.397 --> 07:23.704
If they were mine,
you would have never found them.

07:23.747 --> 07:25.619
Yeah, well, he just
used them to study.

07:25.662 --> 07:27.185
If I knew you
were gonna do that,

07:27.229 --> 07:29.449
I would have sprinkled them
on your cereal.

07:33.714 --> 07:35.455
I'm gonna have to
blame that on you.

07:39.546 --> 07:40.851
Whoa.

07:40.895 --> 07:42.679
This is $500.

07:42.723 --> 07:46.509
Oh, my God!
That's where I put it!

07:46.553 --> 07:48.903
Where did Mark get
this kind of money?

07:48.946 --> 07:51.514
Oh, looks like
your perfect little boy

07:51.558 --> 07:53.951
graduated from drug user
to drug dealer.

07:53.995 --> 07:57.520
He said he'd do anything
to get money for college,

07:57.564 --> 07:59.130
but I can't believe
he's doing this.

07:59.174 --> 08:01.437
Yeah, and it doesn't
make any sense.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.526
If you're already making money
selling drugs to kids,

08:03.570 --> 08:04.701
why would you
go to college?

08:04.745 --> 08:05.963
You've already got
a career.

08:10.054 --> 08:12.535
Come on, Darlene.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.102
Mark's not the kind of kid
who deals drugs.

08:14.145 --> 08:15.712
What else is he doing
to make that kind of money?

08:15.756 --> 08:17.148
You gotta
talk to him.

08:17.192 --> 08:19.542
I'm going to, but he lied
about taking the pills.

08:19.586 --> 08:20.891
He's gonna lie
about this,

08:20.935 --> 08:22.632
and if I accuse him
and I'm wrong,

08:22.676 --> 08:24.678
then it's just gonna
split us even further apart.

08:24.721 --> 08:25.983
Oh,
back in my cop days,

08:26.027 --> 08:29.030
we had one guaranteed way
to get the truth.

08:29.073 --> 08:31.119
It --
Well, but it's a whole --

08:31.162 --> 08:33.251
You gotta get
a pit bull and a blindfold.

08:33.295 --> 08:34.601
Geez.

08:34.644 --> 08:38.126
Jackie, Mark is
your great-nephew who you love.

08:38.169 --> 08:39.736
Okay, no blindfold.

08:39.780 --> 08:41.042
It's actually more effective

08:41.085 --> 08:42.957
when you
see the pit bull coming.

08:44.262 --> 08:45.437
You're off the case.

08:45.481 --> 08:46.700
Damn it.

08:46.743 --> 08:49.137
Have either of you
seen anything suspicious?

08:49.180 --> 08:51.922
Okay, maybe this is nothing,
but now that I think about it,

08:51.966 --> 08:53.707
the last couple of weeks
while you were at work,

08:53.750 --> 08:56.187
there's been kids I've
never seen before coming by.

08:56.231 --> 08:57.362
Oh, man.

08:57.406 --> 08:59.060
When I drove Mark home
from school today,

08:59.103 --> 09:01.671
there was an older kid
waiting for him.

09:01.715 --> 09:03.455
Wait,
so the kid that I just

09:03.499 --> 09:05.457
confiscated a bunch of pills from

09:05.501 --> 09:07.808
now has a waiting line of randos
dropping by,

09:07.851 --> 09:09.679
and neither of you thought
just to, oh, mention it?

09:09.723 --> 09:12.943
Hey, you're the one raising
the little Scarface.

09:12.987 --> 09:14.510
Don't blame it on us.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.381
I gotta go.

09:16.425 --> 09:17.687
See?

09:17.731 --> 09:19.863
This is why
I quit the force.

09:19.907 --> 09:22.649
I couldn't handle watching
promising young people

09:22.692 --> 09:24.215
go down the wrong path.

09:24.259 --> 09:26.478
You shot yourself in the leg
with your own gun

09:26.522 --> 09:28.655
and fell down
a flight of stairs.

09:28.698 --> 09:31.614
In despair over
the young people.

09:33.529 --> 09:34.878
God.

09:39.056 --> 09:40.841
My professor is
this brilliant guy

09:40.884 --> 09:44.627
with this dark sense of humor,
so I was surprised to see

09:44.671 --> 09:47.630
how sweet he was
with Beverly Rose today.
Hmm.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.632
The only way I could get her
to leave the classroom

09:49.676 --> 09:51.634
was by promising her
we'd see a horse.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.505
There aren't any horses
in Lanford.

09:53.549 --> 09:57.248
That's why I drove really fast
by that chunky golden retriever

09:57.292 --> 09:58.641
and yelled "Pony!"

09:59.816 --> 10:02.514
Yeah, part of it is that
Glen's single

10:02.558 --> 10:04.038
and he doesn't
have any kids.

10:04.081 --> 10:05.692
He'd probably make
a great dad.

10:05.735 --> 10:07.868
- Don't you do it.
- Do what?

10:07.911 --> 10:10.000
Don't be hot for teacher.
We've all been there.

10:10.044 --> 10:12.655
My training officer,
Hank the Tank,

10:12.699 --> 10:15.266
he was teaching me how to
drive in a high-speed pursuit

10:15.310 --> 10:17.834
and we started going at it
like two cats in heat.

10:17.878 --> 10:19.096
Next thing you know,

10:19.140 --> 10:20.837
we're in our underwear
on the hood of the car.

10:20.881 --> 10:22.709
Put on quite a show
for the dash cam.

10:23.927 --> 10:25.494
Uh, you forgot to
put one on my head.

10:25.537 --> 10:26.495
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

10:26.538 --> 10:27.888
But my point is,

10:27.931 --> 10:30.673
he got demoted
for abuse of rank

10:30.717 --> 10:33.850
and I got a bad rep for
sleeping my way to the middle.

10:33.894 --> 10:36.113
You're way ahead of me.

10:36.157 --> 10:40.378
Yeah, okay, I like him,
but I don't know if he likes me.

10:40.422 --> 10:43.294
I mean, we laugh
in our advisor meetings.

10:43.338 --> 10:45.470
We have these amazing,
deep talks

10:45.514 --> 10:47.821
that I can't have
with anybody else.

10:47.864 --> 10:50.301
Has he given you
any obvious clues?

10:50.345 --> 10:52.695
Just little comments he makes
on my papers.

10:52.739 --> 10:53.870
Like what?

10:53.914 --> 10:56.177
Uh, "Great job."
"You're a star."

10:56.220 --> 10:58.745
That's nice.
That doesn't mean anything.

10:58.788 --> 11:00.572
True, I am a star.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.837
One day,
I turned a paper in late

11:03.880 --> 11:06.100
because I missed class,
and he wrote he missed me.

11:06.143 --> 11:08.493
"Missed"
could be platonic.

11:08.537 --> 11:10.757
I mean,
I miss Kenny Rogers Roasters,

11:10.800 --> 11:11.888
but I wouldn't date him.

11:11.932 --> 11:12.889
What else you got?

11:12.933 --> 11:15.196
Uh...how about this?

11:15.239 --> 11:17.546
"I love the way
your brain works."

11:17.589 --> 11:19.983
He used the word "love"?

11:20.027 --> 11:23.334
Good God! Hot pants!
Get out of that class!

11:23.378 --> 11:25.336
You actually think
he's into me?

11:25.380 --> 11:28.862
You have deep talks.
You laugh together.

11:28.905 --> 11:31.865
He writes flirty little notes
on your papers.

11:31.908 --> 11:34.432
Hot pants!

11:34.476 --> 11:36.739
Okay.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.828
Now it's real.

11:38.872 --> 11:40.612
That's exciting,

11:40.656 --> 11:43.224
but it also sucks,
because you're right.

11:43.267 --> 11:47.010
It could ruin his career,
and how could you resist this?

11:47.054 --> 11:48.838
What are you gonna do?

11:48.882 --> 11:53.843
I have to drop his class
and find another advisor

11:53.887 --> 11:55.976
before something
gets out of hand.

11:56.019 --> 11:57.281
Yeah,
that's the smart move.

11:57.325 --> 11:58.805
That's what I was gonna do
with Hank the Tank,

11:58.848 --> 12:01.590
but then he got caught
stealing money from the mob

12:01.633 --> 12:03.940
and he hit the road...

12:03.984 --> 12:05.855
when they threw him
off an overpass.

12:07.944 --> 12:09.250
Did you bring the money?

12:09.293 --> 12:10.555
Do I have to pay you
up front?

12:10.599 --> 12:11.948
That's the way it works.

12:16.866 --> 12:18.825
You sure your essay's gonna
get me into the college I want?

12:18.868 --> 12:21.784
Trust me, I've been preparing
for this all my life.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.960
Admissions people love
pain and suffering.

12:24.004 --> 12:25.657
They want to hear about
your heroic struggle

12:25.701 --> 12:27.834
to overcome all your
heartbreaking problems.

12:27.877 --> 12:30.140
Dyslexia, broken home,
dead parents, all that crap.

12:30.184 --> 12:31.794
So what do you got?

12:31.838 --> 12:35.015
Uh...
I'm lactose intolerant.

12:35.058 --> 12:36.494
That's it?

12:36.538 --> 12:38.583
Okay, um...

12:38.627 --> 12:41.151
I'm hearing
the tragic tale

12:41.195 --> 12:43.893
of a desperately lonely
young man

12:43.937 --> 12:45.808
whose diseased gut
clenched with fear

12:45.852 --> 12:47.854
every time he heard the bells
of an ice cream truck.

12:48.898 --> 12:51.379
Did you have to go through
any painful medical procedures?

12:51.422 --> 12:52.815
Uh, no.

12:52.859 --> 12:56.471
I just take a lactase chewable
before I eat dairy.

12:56.514 --> 12:58.255
No, no, you don't.

12:58.299 --> 13:01.084
You suffer
the social anxiety

13:01.128 --> 13:03.870
of being different
than everybody else

13:03.913 --> 13:07.003
and battle loneliness
and isolation as a result,

13:07.047 --> 13:10.224
but you persevered
to become...

13:10.267 --> 13:12.443
the treasurer
of the origami club?

13:12.487 --> 13:14.881
You're killing me here.

13:14.924 --> 13:17.057
Okay, well, I'll call you
when I have something.

13:17.100 --> 13:19.146
Go fold yourself
a swan.

13:22.453 --> 13:24.629
Hi, I'm Mark's mom.
Who are you?

13:24.673 --> 13:25.674
I'm Tyler.

13:25.717 --> 13:27.197
Oh, nice to meet you,
Tyler.

13:27.241 --> 13:29.243
You want to give me the pills,
or should I call the police?

13:29.286 --> 13:30.418
What?

13:30.461 --> 13:32.028
I know you've got
pills in your pocket.

13:32.072 --> 13:32.986
Give them to me. Now!

13:33.029 --> 13:34.422
But I -- I need these.

13:34.465 --> 13:36.424
No, you don't.
You just think you do.

13:36.467 --> 13:38.208
No, I really do.

13:38.252 --> 13:40.558
You don't want to know
what happens if I don't.

13:40.602 --> 13:43.344
Ask my brother.
He shares a room with me.

13:43.387 --> 13:45.085
Listen to yourself.

13:45.128 --> 13:47.130
You are whacked
out of your mind.

13:47.174 --> 13:50.220
Go home, tell your parents
you have a problem,

13:50.264 --> 13:51.656
and get some help.

13:51.700 --> 13:54.050
You can beat this, Tyler.
Come on.

13:55.486 --> 13:58.011
I just met Tyler.
What the hell are you thinking?

13:58.054 --> 14:00.056
I told you.
I'm gonna do whatever it takes.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.275
I need money for college.

14:01.318 --> 14:03.059
Oh, and that makes it okay
to sell drugs?

14:03.103 --> 14:05.366
What are you talking about?
I'm not selling drugs.

14:05.409 --> 14:07.281
Oh, really?
What are these?

14:07.324 --> 14:11.067
Pills for lactose intolerance.
Tyler can't eat dairy.

14:11.111 --> 14:13.287
Whoops.

14:13.330 --> 14:15.942
But -- Look, if you're not
dealing drugs,

14:15.985 --> 14:17.726
then how did you
make this?

14:17.769 --> 14:19.510
You searched my room?

14:19.554 --> 14:21.948
No, I was putting away laundry
in your room,

14:21.991 --> 14:25.125
and then Harris came in
and broke your picture frame.

14:27.040 --> 14:29.042
I made that money
writing college admission essays

14:29.085 --> 14:30.826
for kids from
my old magnet school

14:30.870 --> 14:32.349
who are too stupid
to write their own.

14:32.393 --> 14:33.698
That's why Tyler was here.

14:33.742 --> 14:35.962
Well, that's wrong, too.
It's unethical.

14:36.005 --> 14:37.615
Yeah,
but it's not illegal.

14:37.659 --> 14:39.922
Tutors help kids with
their essays all the time.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.793
They don't write them.

14:41.837 --> 14:43.230
Because of
what you're doing,

14:43.273 --> 14:45.188
rich magnet school kids
are getting into colleges

14:45.232 --> 14:46.929
while some
more deserving kids aren't.

14:46.973 --> 14:49.932
Yeah, I'm one of those
more deserving kids,

14:49.976 --> 14:52.413
and I'm going to keep
taking advantage of these idiots

14:52.456 --> 14:55.807
until I have enough
money to go to one of
these colleges, too.

14:55.851 --> 14:58.027
And your snooping is forcing me
to do something

14:58.071 --> 15:00.160
that no Conner
has ever done.

15:00.203 --> 15:01.639
I'm gonna go
open a savings account.

15:11.171 --> 15:12.085
Hey.

15:12.128 --> 15:14.087
This is
a nice surprise.

15:14.130 --> 15:15.784
Were we supposed to
meet today?

15:15.827 --> 15:18.178
No,
but I need to talk to you.

15:18.221 --> 15:20.615
I'm all ears.
Get 'em from my father.

15:20.658 --> 15:22.834
Better than my mother.
She was all nose.

15:22.878 --> 15:26.577
So, uh...what's up?

15:28.014 --> 15:30.016
I need to transfer
out of your class

15:30.059 --> 15:32.148
and take it with
another professor.

15:32.192 --> 15:35.673
Well, there's two problems
with that.

15:35.717 --> 15:37.588
One, this course is
a requirement

15:37.632 --> 15:39.895
and I'm the only one
who teaches it.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.637
And two, you're doing great
in this class.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.595
Why would you
want to transfer?

15:44.639 --> 15:47.207
Because I have feelings for you,

15:47.250 --> 15:50.862
and if I'm reading
my graded papers correctly,

15:50.906 --> 15:54.388
I think you might have
feelings for me, too,

15:54.431 --> 15:58.000
unless I've misread
this whole thing,

15:58.044 --> 16:01.830
in which case, I hope
you have a very tiny stroke

16:01.873 --> 16:05.181
that just kills
this memory.

16:05.225 --> 16:08.402
It took a lot of courage
to tell me that.

16:08.445 --> 16:10.665
I'll try to be
just as brave.

16:11.927 --> 16:15.409
Don't tell anyone,
'cause I'll deny it if you do --

16:15.452 --> 16:17.106
I have feelings for you,
too.

16:17.150 --> 16:19.456
But you didn't
hear it from me.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.937
I knew you liked me!

16:21.981 --> 16:23.852
Shh, shh. Maybe we keep
our voices down

16:23.895 --> 16:26.681
to a non-career-ending
level.

16:26.724 --> 16:30.337
Sorry.
I just really enjoy being right.

16:31.468 --> 16:34.428
I know you can get fired
for dating me.

16:34.471 --> 16:36.865
And I'm worried about
what this could do to you, too.

16:36.908 --> 16:38.127
I mean,
the students would hate you

16:38.171 --> 16:40.173
for getting their
favorite professor fired.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.480
So what do we do?

16:43.524 --> 16:46.222
Easy.
The only thing we can do.

16:46.266 --> 16:49.486
I marry you immediately and we
grow old doing psych research.

16:49.530 --> 16:51.923
We'll shock babies together
off the coast.

16:54.665 --> 16:56.841
Why don't we talk about this
over dinner?

16:56.885 --> 16:58.626
We just gotta find
a place to meet

16:58.669 --> 17:01.237
that's so horrible, nobody
but us would ever go there.

17:02.238 --> 17:04.849
Uh, you know
that tire fire

17:04.893 --> 17:08.070
that's been burning for years
out by the landfill?

17:08.114 --> 17:09.985
Good start.

17:10.029 --> 17:13.858
There's a really nice,
little Peruvian jazz place

17:13.902 --> 17:15.251
right next door.

17:15.295 --> 17:17.645
I know it. I thought
they closed that place down.

17:17.688 --> 17:19.125
Oh, no.

17:19.168 --> 17:22.215
It reopens every day the wind
is blowing from the east.

17:31.311 --> 17:32.529
Can I help you?

17:32.573 --> 17:33.704
Are you Mark Healy?

17:33.748 --> 17:34.792
I am.

17:34.836 --> 17:36.272
I'm Will Deetler.

17:36.316 --> 17:37.969
You wrote an essay
for my daughter.

17:38.013 --> 17:40.320
Oh, hi.
I'm Mark's mother.

17:40.363 --> 17:42.931
I already talked to him and
told him what he did was wrong,

17:42.974 --> 17:44.367
and we're so sorry
about that.

17:44.411 --> 17:46.152
That's not the problem.

17:46.195 --> 17:48.589
The essay Mark wrote
was exactly the same

17:48.632 --> 17:50.156
as an essay he wrote
for another kid

17:50.199 --> 17:52.549
who was also going to submit it
to Northwestern.

17:52.593 --> 17:55.335
Thank God the two kids talked
and caught it.

17:55.378 --> 17:57.032
That was pretty stupid,
man.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.643
Hey, I do have a kid you can
call stupid, but not this one.

18:00.731 --> 18:03.778
He'll pay your daughter back
her money.

18:03.821 --> 18:05.997
She didn't pay for it.
I did.

18:06.041 --> 18:09.610
She wrote an essay about
an eyebrow threading gone wrong.

18:09.653 --> 18:12.003
When I told her it was terrible,
she looked sad

18:12.047 --> 18:13.353
or angry.

18:13.396 --> 18:16.007
Her eyebrows are so screwed up,
I couldn't tell.

18:16.051 --> 18:18.140
This was your idea?

18:18.184 --> 18:19.663
Oh, my God.

18:19.707 --> 18:22.144
You've got no moral ground
to complain about anything.

18:22.188 --> 18:25.365
I don't need moral ground.
I need a new essay.

18:25.408 --> 18:26.496
Well, no!

18:26.540 --> 18:28.368
You're done taking advantage
of my kid.

18:28.411 --> 18:30.326
Look, the application deadline
is next week.

18:30.370 --> 18:33.373
Don't make me go to Mark's
principal and get him expelled.

18:33.416 --> 18:36.289
Oh, you do that and I'll go to
the magnet school and get...

18:36.332 --> 18:37.594
What's your idiot kid's
name?

18:37.638 --> 18:40.162
- Skyler.
- Oh, of course it is.

18:40.206 --> 18:43.165
I'll get Skyler expelled
from there.

18:43.209 --> 18:45.559
We built the new cafeteria
at the magnet school,

18:45.602 --> 18:47.038
so take your best shot.

18:47.082 --> 18:49.171
How about I tell every school
she applies to

18:49.215 --> 18:50.955
that she does not
write her own essays?

18:50.999 --> 18:52.218
Then she'll be blacklisted

18:52.261 --> 18:54.568
from getting into
any school anywhere.

18:54.611 --> 18:57.092
Take a look at our furniture,
cafeteria man.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.615
We got nothing to lose!

19:00.617 --> 19:01.966
That was great!

19:02.010 --> 19:04.404
I can't believe
you stuck up for me like that.

19:04.447 --> 19:06.623
That is
what parents do,

19:06.667 --> 19:09.365
but they don't do it twice,
so listen up.

19:09.409 --> 19:12.063
If both of those essays
would have gone to Northwestern,

19:12.107 --> 19:13.717
you know those kids
would have turned you in,

19:13.761 --> 19:15.980
and <i>you</i> would have been
blacklisted along with them,

19:16.024 --> 19:18.461
then you can forget about
going to college anywhere.

19:20.463 --> 19:21.682
Then what am I
supposed to do?

19:21.725 --> 19:24.119
I don't know how else
to pay for college.

19:26.034 --> 19:28.689
I may have found a way,
but it's gonna take awhile.

19:28.732 --> 19:30.995
What?

19:31.039 --> 19:33.998
Okay, I've been up every night
looking for scholarships,

19:34.042 --> 19:37.045
and one way that you can get
colleges to give you one

19:37.088 --> 19:38.612
is to have a unique skill

19:38.655 --> 19:41.571
like playing an instrument
in their orchestra

19:41.615 --> 19:43.269
that no one else
wants to play.

19:43.312 --> 19:44.357
Like what, a tuba?

19:44.400 --> 19:47.664
No, way more embarrassing
than that.

19:47.708 --> 19:50.841
It's something that
nobody wants to learn.

19:52.321 --> 19:54.628
The contrabassoon.

19:54.671 --> 19:56.934
Oh, my God.
It's giant.

19:56.978 --> 19:59.459
Uh, this is what it sounds like
if you do it well.

20:02.766 --> 20:05.421
That should take you
about two years to get to that.

20:09.295 --> 20:11.601
Alright,
let's get one.

20:11.645 --> 20:13.473
And I think
I might be able to get

20:13.516 --> 20:15.301
a great college essay
out of this.

20:15.344 --> 20:17.172
"I'm a gay
contrabassoonist

20:17.216 --> 20:19.305
from the wrong side
of the tracks."

20:19.348 --> 20:21.045
Buckle in.
Why?

20:21.089 --> 20:24.223
'Cause you are on a rocket sled
to Harvard.

20:29.010 --> 20:31.534
So, now that Mark's
gone sideways,

20:31.578 --> 20:33.275
you're my only hope.

20:33.319 --> 20:36.322
And since you're kind of
a blank slate,

20:36.365 --> 20:39.150
I want to get you going
in the right direction.

20:39.194 --> 20:42.110
Now, the Chinese culture
has it right --

20:42.153 --> 20:45.679
the way to happiness is
to honor your oldest relative

20:45.722 --> 20:47.898
by letting them
live with you

20:47.942 --> 20:51.946
and taking care of them their
whole life, okay, sweet pea?

20:51.989 --> 20:53.556
Okay.
Okay.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.384
Mm.

20:58.344 --> 21:00.955
Oh, you're gonna be a whole
different kind of special.
