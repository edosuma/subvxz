- Duncan!

00:30.795 --> 00:34.268
<i>No sister should have
to bury her little brother.</i>

00:34.368 --> 00:36.840
Stan was a kind, loving soul

00:36.874 --> 00:39.445
who was taken from us
much too soon.

00:39.513 --> 00:41.049
Too soon, Lord!

00:41.115 --> 00:42.619
Much too soon!

00:42.686 --> 00:44.088
Yes, it was. Settle down.

00:44.188 --> 00:47.261
Stan died alone,
facedown in a public toilet

00:47.328 --> 00:48.864
at the local water park.

00:48.931 --> 00:50.467
His body was so bloated,

00:50.501 --> 00:52.706
everyone assumed he was
an inflatable pool toy.

00:52.739 --> 00:55.444
But even in the end,
he gave joy to the children

00:55.477 --> 00:57.749
who rode him
down the lazy river.

00:57.816 --> 00:58.751
Anyhoo, he's dead,

00:58.884 --> 01:01.389
and his sins and gambling debts
are now forgiven.

01:01.456 --> 01:03.594
Let us pray.
- Oh, rats!

01:03.661 --> 01:06.065
Oh, tough break,
Frankie the Weasel.

01:09.071 --> 01:10.642
Okay, they're gone.

01:10.708 --> 01:11.977
You can get up, Uncle Stan.

01:12.044 --> 01:13.313
- Hey.
- Oh!

01:13.380 --> 01:14.549
Sorry.

01:14.616 --> 01:16.954
I never get used to that part
of your fake funerals.

01:16.987 --> 01:18.089
You went off script, Annie.

01:18.156 --> 01:19.425
You were supposed to say I died

01:19.492 --> 01:20.929
donating too much bone marrow.

01:20.962 --> 01:22.966
I thought corpse pool toy

01:23.033 --> 01:24.168
was more believable for you.

01:24.201 --> 01:26.941
Well, thanks anyway for doing
my monthly fake funeral.

01:26.974 --> 01:29.145
Hey, I heard Frankie the Weasel

01:29.178 --> 01:30.848
sent a deli platter
to your house.

01:30.882 --> 01:31.850
Let's eat!

01:32.451 --> 01:33.320
How come you were crying

01:33.353 --> 01:35.457
if you knew he was alive
the whole time?

01:35.525 --> 01:38.163
There are very few places
a man can openly weep,

01:38.196 --> 01:39.967
and I take advantage.

01:40.033 --> 01:41.704
Ooh, the Carlson funeral.

01:41.770 --> 01:42.872
Yes!

01:48.985 --> 01:50.187
Ha.

01:50.253 --> 01:52.458
- What's Uncle Stan doing?
- Stealing gas.

01:52.525 --> 01:54.730
It's something people did
in '70s movies.

01:54.763 --> 01:55.430
Ah.

01:55.497 --> 01:57.001
There's nothing like a good cry

01:57.067 --> 01:58.771
followed by a deli plate.

01:58.804 --> 01:59.740
What a great day.

01:59.773 --> 02:01.142
That was the worst turnout

02:01.209 --> 02:03.113
of any of Stan's fake funerals.

02:03.146 --> 02:06.052
One day, I'm afraid
he actually will die alone.

02:06.119 --> 02:07.254
Not necessarily.

02:07.321 --> 02:08.591
If he's murdered,
he wouldn't be alone.

02:08.658 --> 02:11.029
Uncle Stan
is gonna get murdered?

02:11.129 --> 02:12.464
Oh, sweetie, no.

02:12.464 --> 02:14.636
Not for a long, long time.

02:14.703 --> 02:16.472
But if he does end up
sad and alone,

02:16.540 --> 02:18.176
I'm going to wonder,
did I really

02:18.209 --> 02:19.546
do everything I could
to help him?

02:19.613 --> 02:22.786
I lose sleep thinking
the same thing about Duncan.

02:22.886 --> 02:24.556
Ugh!

02:24.589 --> 02:26.927
My stupid neck ribbon
won't come off.

02:29.098 --> 02:31.436
You take your eyes off him
for one second.

02:31.537 --> 02:34.041
All right, I might have
swallowed some of that gas,

02:34.108 --> 02:36.045
so no one come
into the bathroom for a while.

02:36.079 --> 02:37.314
Stan, wait.

02:37.414 --> 02:39.953
It was sad seeing you
in that casket today

02:40.020 --> 02:41.089
with no one who loved you.

02:41.155 --> 02:42.257
Good point.

02:42.358 --> 02:43.627
Next time, I'll pay
a pretty lady

02:43.694 --> 02:44.663
to be my widow.

02:44.696 --> 02:45.998
No, you need someone

02:46.065 --> 02:47.267
to be a better person for.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.771
Like Jack is for me.

02:50.207 --> 02:51.376
Love you, baby.

02:51.442 --> 02:53.146
"What exactly
are you suggesting?"

02:53.213 --> 02:55.317
he asked for himself,
but also for the audience.

02:55.350 --> 02:56.954
I'm gonna help you
turn your life around.

02:57.021 --> 03:00.427
It is time to settle down,
pay for gas, and get married.

03:00.460 --> 03:01.864
I appreciate your concern,

03:01.897 --> 03:04.101
but outside of
crippling bouts of loneliness,

03:04.135 --> 03:05.137
I'm okay.

03:05.203 --> 03:06.974
Oh, God, I'm so lonely.

03:07.007 --> 03:08.644
Do I even exist?

03:08.677 --> 03:10.013
See? It passes.

03:10.080 --> 03:11.449
Stan, what you need

03:11.482 --> 03:13.453
is the real girlfriend experience,

03:13.521 --> 03:15.123
and I'm gonna give it to you.

03:15.190 --> 03:16.325
I'm only five,

03:16.359 --> 03:18.731
but even I know
you said that wrong.

03:18.798 --> 03:20.668
You know what?
I've got a couple hours.

03:20.702 --> 03:22.539
So go ahead.
Turn my whole life around.

03:22.605 --> 03:24.743
Ugh, now my shoes
won't come off.

03:25.410 --> 03:26.980
Should I cut your pants off,

03:27.047 --> 03:28.751
or do you want to do it?

03:33.928 --> 03:34.896
Hey, Duncan.

03:34.930 --> 03:37.802
Why aren't you dressed for gym?
Mesothelioma?

03:37.902 --> 03:40.273
According to the shows
my grandma watches,

03:40.340 --> 03:41.977
that's what everyone has.

03:42.010 --> 03:43.948
No, trying
to get out of dodgeball.

03:44.014 --> 03:46.219
I can't throw
or catch or dodge.

03:46.285 --> 03:48.323
It's like they figured out
all your weaknesses.

03:48.389 --> 03:49.391
You'd die in the wild.

03:49.425 --> 03:51.462
Wouldn't last a day.

03:51.530 --> 03:53.801
Harris, why aren't you
in gym clothes?

03:53.868 --> 03:55.437
Oh, I forgot them again.

03:55.470 --> 03:56.239
Whoops.

03:56.305 --> 03:57.675
I'll let you off today,

03:57.742 --> 04:00.180
but show up without gym clothes tomorrow,

04:00.247 --> 04:01.984
and you're gonna play naked!

04:02.050 --> 04:04.221
You can't make me do that!

04:04.255 --> 04:05.892
Yes, he can.

04:07.829 --> 04:09.933
His pee-pee's sizzlin'!

04:13.206 --> 04:16.045
Are you sure this
is a men's clothing store?

04:16.112 --> 04:19.452
Where are all the airbrushed
"Ass, Gas, or Grass" T-shirts?

04:19.485 --> 04:21.723
Stan, don't make suggestions
or think.

04:21.757 --> 04:22.959
Just try these on.

04:23.059 --> 04:25.464
Once I finish
"Queer Eyeing" you,

04:25.531 --> 04:28.136
you're gonna be up to your ears
in sensible women.

Uncle Stan!

05:09.118 --> 05:11.255
Sorry,
had to finish my cigarette.

Where's my brother-in-law?

All I see is this smokin' hot
Olive Garden bartender.

05:24.315 --> 05:25.651
And you don't smell like

05:25.718 --> 05:27.856
when Mommy dropped
that bottle of wine anymore.

05:27.889 --> 05:30.093
There's a lot of stuff
I don't smell like anymore,

05:30.160 --> 05:31.362
and I feel fantastic.

05:31.395 --> 05:32.397
Thanks, sis.

05:32.464 --> 05:33.901
And to make sure
I don't backslide

05:33.968 --> 05:36.339
within ten minutes,
I'm gonna burn my old stuff

05:36.372 --> 05:38.511

to rest for good.

05:38.544 --> 05:41.482
Whoa, that's your box
of stuff for scams.

05:41.550 --> 05:42.685
Are you sure
you want to give it up?

05:42.752 --> 05:44.823

so many lives with this.

- A neck brace?

05:57.147 --> 05:57.982
Yeah, I used it

05:58.082 --> 05:59.485
to get out of things
I didn't want to do,

05:59.519 --> 06:01.389
like help friends move
or serve my country.

06:01.455 --> 06:03.026
Or get out of gym class

06:03.059 --> 06:04.763
and showering after gym class

06:04.796 --> 06:06.032

for people who died
on the "Titanic"?

06:20.160 --> 06:23.066
Sensible women want a man

Maybe you should come, Duncan.

06:27.207 --> 06:30.313
I've always wanted us to have
a mother-son dance.

06:30.347 --> 06:31.583
Can't. Doctor's orders.

07:31.268 --> 07:32.404
You look like an idiot.

07:32.471 --> 07:33.641
Don't care. I like it.

It's like a big hug

Do you think
they're moving too fast?

07:48.604 --> 07:50.373
Doesn't mean it's not real.

07:50.407 --> 07:52.612

08:40.841 --> 08:42.545
Also, I'm into old women.

08:42.578 --> 08:43.647
That's impossible.

08:43.714 --> 08:45.483
No one is.
- That's not true.

08:45.551 --> 08:48.222
What about Susan Sarandon
and that ping-pong guy?

08:48.289 --> 08:49.158
I loved them.

08:49.291 --> 08:51.328
And what about
Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore?

08:51.395 --> 08:53.901
And Keanu Reeves
and that woman his age?

08:53.934 --> 08:54.969
Really, Stan,

08:55.036 --> 08:57.474
sleeping with an old lady
to take her money?

08:57.542 --> 08:59.512
That was you in high school.

08:59.579 --> 09:01.048
Hey, I wanted a dirt bike.

09:01.115 --> 09:03.654
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going back upstairs

09:03.687 --> 09:05.725
to enter the gates of Helen.

09:05.791 --> 09:08.262
Oh, put me in the swing, lover.

09:09.331 --> 09:12.605
He brought his sex swing in
from the van?

09:12.672 --> 09:14.642
I'm gonna play
on the swing too.

09:14.709 --> 09:16.312
Have fun, honey.

09:16.345 --> 09:17.615
- Jack!
- Right, right, right.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.136
Gym sucks today.

09:28.169 --> 09:30.473
You're so lucky
you're fake injured.

09:30.574 --> 09:32.010
Yup. No gym.

09:32.077 --> 09:34.481
And I don't have to stand
for the Pledge of Allegiance.

09:34.516 --> 09:35.785
Awesome!

09:35.818 --> 09:37.722
That neck brace is like
a cheat code for life.

09:37.755 --> 09:39.124
I wish I had one.

09:39.224 --> 09:41.630
My friend Xavier invited me
to a spoken word performance,

09:41.696 --> 09:42.732
and I want to get out of it.

09:42.799 --> 09:44.101
You guys don't know him.

09:44.168 --> 09:46.305
He's one of my smart friends.
- We don't care.

09:46.338 --> 09:49.612
You can borrow my brace
after gym today, Mia.

09:49.646 --> 09:50.915
You all can borrow it

09:51.015 --> 09:52.752
as long as you don't mind
a little rash.

09:52.785 --> 09:54.622
Spoken word tonight at 6:00!

09:56.593 --> 09:58.429
Yeah, brace me.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.634
That one looks like
a guy with a coat hanger

10:00.701 --> 10:02.104
breaking into
a vending machine.

10:02.137 --> 10:05.343
That one looks like
a pair of compression socks.

10:05.410 --> 10:07.548
You mean the ones I'm about
to pull off you with my teeth?

10:07.648 --> 10:09.017
Come here.

10:09.084 --> 10:11.255
Oh, Stanley.

10:12.825 --> 10:14.896
Those two make me sick.

10:14.963 --> 10:16.967
What's your problem, Mom?
They're cute together.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.069
Love is love.

10:18.136 --> 10:20.608
Yeah, I'm totally rooting
for "Stelen."

10:20.674 --> 10:23.179
Stelen?
What the heck's a Stelen?

10:23.212 --> 10:25.584
What does that mean?
- Stan and Helen.

10:25.651 --> 10:26.853
It's their names
mushed together,

10:26.920 --> 10:28.924
like celebrities
who are doomed to break up.

10:28.991 --> 10:30.160
You know,
your mom and I tried that

10:30.226 --> 10:32.598
with our names,
but "Ack" never caught on.

10:32.665 --> 10:35.203
I put a lot of work
into transforming Stan,

10:35.236 --> 10:38.911
and once again, he makes
the worst life choice possible.

10:38.977 --> 10:40.013
That's it.

10:40.079 --> 10:42.217
I'm gonna help Jing
make a macaroni necklace,

10:42.284 --> 10:45.256
then storm over there
and break their asses up.

10:45.290 --> 10:47.962
Angry macaroni necklace. Yay!

10:48.029 --> 10:49.799
Ooh, Mom wants
to break up Stelen.

10:49.899 --> 10:50.801

15:02.337 --> 15:04.074
Now, when Helen walks
down the aisle,

15:04.141 --> 15:06.211
I was thinking of starting
with "Hot For Teacher"

15:06.278 --> 15:08.650
and ending with
"And the Cradle Will Rock."

15:08.683 --> 15:10.554
How about
"Here Comes the Bride"?

15:10.621 --> 15:12.357
That's why you're in charge.

15:12.424 --> 15:15.229

should I wear?

15:15.263 --> 15:17.535

16:43.138 --> 16:44.542

Spandau Ballet's "True,"

17:11.328 --> 17:14.569

17:44.461 --> 17:47.233
to bring together this guy
and his sister's neighbor.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.538
As God said in the Bible,
"Love is cool."

17:49.605 --> 17:51.809
Now, before we get
to kissing and dancing,

17:51.843 --> 17:53.112
if anyone has any reason

17:53.178 --> 17:54.314
these two
shouldn't get married,

17:54.381 --> 17:56.084
speak now or forever wait

17:56.151 --> 17:58.055
to gossip about it
at the reception.

17:58.088 --> 18:01.261
Let him make his own choices.

18:01.295 --> 18:03.600
All right then.

18:11.849 --> 18:12.618
You're right.

18:12.751 --> 18:14.387
Stan, I tried to stay
out of your life

18:14.421 --> 18:16.526
and not be a control freak,
but we saw you

18:16.559 --> 18:19.297

Okay. That's the wrong word.

18:28.883 --> 18:31.321
And also,
I'm his sponsor in AA.

18:31.388 --> 18:33.727
But you were leaning in
and kissing him all...

18:35.764 --> 18:39.270
I was smelling his breath
to see if he was drunk.

18:39.337 --> 18:40.540

18:40.574 --> 18:42.443

18:42.477 --> 18:44.915

18:44.982 --> 18:46.686
<i>But when I realized
he was sober</i>

18:46.719 --> 18:49.659
and really in love,
I was so happy for him.

18:49.692 --> 18:53.767

startling revelation?

19:09.431 --> 19:11.368
I'm Burt, Helen's ex.

19:11.435 --> 19:14.207
Baby, I can't stand
to see you with another man.

19:14.274 --> 19:15.844
You know how jealous I get!

19:15.911 --> 19:17.981
Well, it took you
long enough.

19:18.015 --> 19:18.983
What?

19:19.050 --> 19:20.186
Look, the truth is,

19:20.252 --> 19:22.390
once a year,
I stage a fake wedding

19:22.457 --> 19:24.562
to get my ex interested again.

19:24.628 --> 19:27.166
And she always gets me.
Don't you?

19:27.200 --> 19:28.837
Don't you, H-bomb?

19:33.145 --> 19:34.114
But I love you!

19:34.180 --> 19:35.449
I got a vasectomy for you.

19:35.483 --> 19:38.022
Ugh. They're reversible.
Calm down.

19:38.088 --> 19:39.859
Helen, you're a monster.

19:39.925 --> 19:41.094
You scammed me.

19:41.161 --> 19:43.298
You...scammed me.

19:43.332 --> 19:44.502
Yeah, sorry.

19:44.568 --> 19:47.106
The love was fake, but the sex?

19:47.173 --> 19:49.010
Very much real.

19:49.077 --> 19:51.448
Come on, Burt,
let's wreck the buffet.

19:51.481 --> 19:53.218
Don't tell me what to do!

19:53.285 --> 19:55.089
Anybody else
want to marry this dude?

19:55.156 --> 19:57.293
No? Okay. I'm gone.

19:57.360 --> 19:59.899
What a lying,
scheming con woman.

19:59.965 --> 20:02.203
I'm more
in love with her than ever.

20:02.236 --> 20:04.542
And now another man's
gonna be digging Helen's--

20:04.608 --> 20:06.679
Stop. I know you're hurting.

20:06.746 --> 20:09.084
That's why I signed you up
at Telder,

20:09.117 --> 20:10.453

Hold on.

20:50.801 --> 20:52.671
There's one slice
of wedding cake left.

20:54.407 --> 20:57.046
In my experience, there's
only one way to settle this.

No-holds-barred
