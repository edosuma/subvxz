WEBVTT

00:02.035 --> 00:03.764
Last time
on Star Trek: Voyager...

00:03.870 --> 00:05.360
l believe

00:05.471 --> 00:06.404
we know each other.

00:06.473 --> 00:07.599
You're Tuvok, right?

00:07.707 --> 00:10.073
We met last week at
the shift briefing.

00:10.143 --> 00:12.611
Before that.
Before we were working here.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.078
Oh, l don't think so.

00:14.147 --> 00:15.444
A romantic relationship

00:15.515 --> 00:17.506
is really out of the question
for me right now, and when

00:17.584 --> 00:19.051
-you started asking...
-How about a friend?

00:19.119 --> 00:20.108
What?

00:20.186 --> 00:22.051
Could you use a friend?

00:22.122 --> 00:23.146
lt's nice to be in a place

00:23.223 --> 00:24.952
where different species
get along so well.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.583
Oh, so, you admit
we're getting along?

00:26.659 --> 00:27.683
Kim to Chakotay.

00:27.761 --> 00:28.955
Go ahead.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.360
l've found them, Commander.

00:30.430 --> 00:32.330
-Let go of me!
-l'm not going to hurt you.

00:34.901 --> 00:35.560
No!

00:35.668 --> 00:37.135
No!

00:38.705 --> 00:40.468
Harry, l need
an emergency transport now!

00:46.179 --> 00:47.146
No, leave me alone!

00:47.213 --> 00:49.272
We're friends;
we're trying to help you.

00:49.349 --> 00:50.680
No, don't touch me!

00:50.750 --> 00:53.514
l don't believe you are
who you think you are!

00:54.654 --> 00:57.020
We don't belong here.

00:57.090 --> 00:58.114
This isn't right!

00:58.191 --> 00:59.681
We don't belong here!

00:59.759 --> 01:00.885
And now the conclusion.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:09.502 --> 01:10.434
Wait here.

01:10.503 --> 01:11.902
Yes, sir.

01:38.231 --> 01:41.200
He's deactivated a safety field.

01:44.003 --> 01:46.597
Alert Emergency Medical.

01:46.706 --> 01:47.673
He may have tried to ju...

02:17.137 --> 02:19.332
l can't penetrate their shields.

02:20.507 --> 02:22.805
Maybe we don't have to.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.741
The Battle of Vorkado.

02:24.811 --> 02:27.302
lt's in my tactical database.

02:27.380 --> 02:28.711
A Romulan Captain disabled

02:28.781 --> 02:30.544
two attacking vessels
by creating

02:30.617 --> 02:32.778
a photonic shock wave
between the ships.

02:32.852 --> 02:33.944
How'd he do that?

02:34.020 --> 02:35.647
Watch and learn.

02:42.862 --> 02:45.296
l don't think they'll
be bothering us again.

02:45.365 --> 02:48.698
Good work. Let's go
back for Chakotay.

02:48.801 --> 02:49.961
Five more ships

02:50.069 --> 02:51.263
on an intercept course.

02:51.371 --> 02:53.862
What's your tactical database
telling you now?

02:53.973 --> 02:58.171
Transporters are damaged.
Shields are failing.

02:58.244 --> 03:00.007
We have to retreat,
come up with a new plan.

03:00.046 --> 03:01.536
Agreed.

03:26.506 --> 03:28.235
Listen, l'm sorry
about my friend.

03:28.308 --> 03:30.037
Excuse me?

03:30.109 --> 03:31.269
Jaffen.

03:31.344 --> 03:34.177
He wasn't very nice
when l invited you to join us.

03:37.083 --> 03:38.516
Are you all right?

03:38.585 --> 03:40.553
l'm just a little tired.

03:40.620 --> 03:42.520
First day on a new job.

03:42.589 --> 03:44.352
l know how that can be.

03:44.424 --> 03:45.652
Well, l just wanted
to let you know

03:45.725 --> 03:47.352
you're more than welcome
to sit with us.

03:47.427 --> 03:50.157
Actually, l was thinking
about going home.

03:50.230 --> 03:53.825
Well, if you change your mind,
we're celebrating.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.731
What's the occasion?

03:55.835 --> 03:57.860
l've decided
to move in with Jaffen.

03:59.739 --> 04:01.206
Congratulations.

05:59.692 --> 06:02.183
Look among the patrons.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.842
Yerid, Criminal lnvestigations.

06:16.943 --> 06:19.776
We run an honest business.

06:19.846 --> 06:21.575
l'm looking for two
people who disappeared

06:21.647 --> 06:23.308
after leaving here
earlier this evening.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.714
One was a young
pregnant woman...

06:24.784 --> 06:26.718
B'Elanna?

06:26.786 --> 06:27.878
You know her?

06:28.020 --> 06:31.478
Oh, l knew l should have
walked her to the Transport.

06:31.557 --> 06:34.082
Why, did you think
someone might try to hurt her?

06:34.160 --> 06:36.060
This city is supposed
to be safe.

06:36.129 --> 06:38.757
The person with her
was described as short

06:38.831 --> 06:40.890
with mottled skin,
facial hair...

06:41.000 --> 06:42.729
Sounds like someone
who was in here earlier,

06:42.835 --> 06:44.268
a worker from the plant.

06:44.337 --> 06:45.269
Do you know his name?

06:45.338 --> 06:49.502
Uh... Neelix, l think.

06:49.575 --> 06:50.633
Did you see him

06:50.743 --> 06:52.643
talking to anyone else
while he was here?

06:52.712 --> 06:56.443
He had a friend.
Uh, Amal something.

06:56.516 --> 06:57.608
Can you describe him?

06:57.683 --> 06:58.615
Oh, l don't have to.

06:58.684 --> 06:59.981
He's sitting right over...

07:04.557 --> 07:09.654
ECH Log, Stardate 54622.4.

07:09.729 --> 07:12.562
l've found an ingenious place
to hide while we make repairs--

07:12.632 --> 07:15.157
a moon
with a paramagnetic core

07:15.268 --> 07:17.828
that masks
our energy signature.

07:17.970 --> 07:19.494
l've turned my attention
to Lieutenant Torres,

07:19.605 --> 07:23.871
whose treatment
will also require ingenuity.

07:23.943 --> 07:25.570
The scan on the left
was performed

07:25.645 --> 07:27.203
during B'Elanna's last physical.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.510
The one on the right,
just a few minutes ago.

07:29.582 --> 07:33.712
The memory centers of her brain
have been radically altered.

07:33.786 --> 07:35.879
People from our crew
seemed to remember

07:35.955 --> 07:37.889
parts of their real lives,

07:37.957 --> 07:40.482
but they got a lot
of the details wrong.

07:40.560 --> 07:43.996
Tom knew his name,
that he was from Earth,

07:44.063 --> 07:47.430
but he said space travel
made him sick.

07:47.500 --> 07:50.492
Whoever did this
is very sophisticated,

07:50.570 --> 07:53.630
capable of selectively
manipulating memory engrams.

07:53.739 --> 07:56.230
Some have been suppressed,
some altered,

07:56.342 --> 07:58.071
others left intact.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.611
Can you undo the damage?

07:59.679 --> 08:03.308
l believe so, but
it'll take some time.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.714
l wish l could help.

08:05.751 --> 08:06.718
Maybe you can.

08:06.786 --> 08:09.220
She'll require
several treatments.

08:09.288 --> 08:10.482
ln between,
you could expose her

08:10.556 --> 08:12.683
to familiar sights
and surroundings.

08:12.758 --> 08:13.816
Say no more.

08:13.960 --> 08:17.361
l'll take her on a whirlwind
tour of her own life.

08:17.430 --> 08:18.590
Don't rush things.

08:18.664 --> 08:22.065
This is going to be
very traumatic for her.

08:25.171 --> 08:28.072
Acute anxiety, depression...

08:28.140 --> 08:29.368
When l interviewed him,
he insisted

08:29.442 --> 08:30.704
that he's not
who he's supposed to be

08:30.776 --> 08:33.210
that we've...
''stolen his katra, ''

08:33.279 --> 08:34.541
whatever that is.

08:34.614 --> 08:36.582
Conclusions?

08:36.649 --> 08:39.812
Tri-lobe regression complex?
Polar-affective disorder?

08:39.885 --> 08:42.912
Neuropsychiatry isn't
a guessing game, Dr. Ravoc.

08:43.990 --> 08:46.288
Dysphoria Syndrome.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.691
You have been studying
my research.

08:48.761 --> 08:50.194
According to your work,

08:50.263 --> 08:51.560
the condition is very rare.

08:51.631 --> 08:52.563
lt is.

08:52.632 --> 08:55.032
l've treated this man before.

08:55.134 --> 08:57.602
Apparently,
he's suffered a relapse.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.170
Recommended treatment?

08:59.238 --> 09:02.469
Engramatic resequencing
is typically indicated.

09:02.542 --> 09:03.907
You seem skeptical.

09:03.976 --> 09:07.104
Resequencing is
a radical procedure.

09:07.179 --> 09:08.806
lf he had a malignant tumor,

09:08.881 --> 09:10.678
would you be afraid
to cut it out?

09:11.751 --> 09:12.683
No.

09:12.752 --> 09:13.776
This syndrome

09:13.853 --> 09:14.979
is just as insidious.

09:15.054 --> 09:17.147
lt requires
aggressive treatment.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.349
Get started.

09:27.867 --> 09:28.959
Please...

09:29.068 --> 09:30.865
help me.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.238
That's what we're here to do.

09:53.492 --> 09:56.359
l want to know the status
of Employee 8583.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.897
Maybe it's different
where you come from,

09:58.998 --> 10:01.728
but here it's polite
to say ''good morning.''

10:01.801 --> 10:03.393
Good morning.

10:07.173 --> 10:09.403
8583,

10:09.475 --> 10:12.376
the man who was removed
by Security yesterday.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.844
He's been hospitalized.

10:13.913 --> 10:15.710
ls there any reason to believe

10:15.781 --> 10:18.181
that his condition
might be contagious?

10:18.250 --> 10:20.309
He came in contact
with other workers.

10:20.386 --> 10:22.354
Some of them
have expressed concern.

10:22.421 --> 10:24.912
Well, tell them not worry.

10:24.991 --> 10:26.424
Excuse me. Am l intruding?

10:26.492 --> 10:28.585
What can we do for you?

10:28.661 --> 10:29.855
l'm investigating
the disappearance

10:29.929 --> 10:32.159
of two of your employees.

10:32.231 --> 10:33.596
Who?

10:33.666 --> 10:35.463
Their names are
Neelix and Torres.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.763
Both of them failed to
report for work today.

10:37.870 --> 10:40.134
What about this man?

10:42.508 --> 10:43.440
Employee 9363.

10:43.509 --> 10:46.342
He didn't report
for his shift either.

10:46.412 --> 10:48.903
l'd like to see
his personnel file,

10:48.981 --> 10:50.846
and l'll need to
interview anyone

10:50.916 --> 10:52.747
who may know where he is.

10:52.818 --> 10:53.750
Why are you looking for him?

10:53.819 --> 10:54.751
l believe he's

10:54.820 --> 10:56.811
responsible for
the disappearance

10:56.889 --> 10:57.913
of the other two.

11:00.926 --> 11:03.156
You've only been here
three weeks.

11:03.229 --> 11:05.220
Where did you get
all these things?

11:05.297 --> 11:06.662
l'm a collector.

11:06.732 --> 11:11.499
You collect spent
plasma relays?

11:11.604 --> 11:15.370
l like to think of it
as a decorative object.

11:20.713 --> 11:26.310
You know... l think this would
look better over there.

11:26.385 --> 11:27.943
You're not going
to start telling me

11:28.054 --> 11:28.918
how to dress, are you?

11:28.988 --> 11:31.252
Where are you going?

11:31.323 --> 11:33.757
To get the rest of my things.

11:33.826 --> 11:35.691
There's more?

12:01.954 --> 12:04.013
Lights.

12:19.338 --> 12:21.397
What do you want?

12:21.507 --> 12:24.476
You told me
you were moving out.

12:36.355 --> 12:37.947
l needed a place

12:38.023 --> 12:39.957
to hide.

12:40.092 --> 12:41.753
Jaffen knows where l am.

12:41.827 --> 12:43.692
He'll come looking for me.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.527
l'm hoping
you won't tell him l'm here.

12:48.634 --> 12:50.534
They say you had something to do

12:50.603 --> 12:53.333
with the disappearance
of a woman at the plant.

12:54.840 --> 12:56.330
l did.

12:56.442 --> 12:59.002
Her name's B'Elanna.

12:59.078 --> 13:01.376
She was brought to this planet
against her will.

13:01.447 --> 13:02.709
Something was done to her

13:02.782 --> 13:04.545
so she'd forget her real life.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.381
And what, you helped her
get home?

13:07.453 --> 13:08.613
That's right.

13:08.687 --> 13:11.212
There are other people
in this city

13:11.290 --> 13:14.384
who l'm also trying to help.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.894
l'm not here to hurt anyone.

13:16.962 --> 13:18.486
You have to trust me.

13:18.564 --> 13:20.896
You're pointing a weapon at me.

13:30.342 --> 13:31.775
Go ahead.

13:31.844 --> 13:33.106
Report me.

13:33.179 --> 13:34.908
But if you do,

13:34.980 --> 13:38.416
a lot of innocent people
are going to suffer.

13:38.484 --> 13:41.385
All l'm asking for
is a place to stay

13:41.453 --> 13:44.581
until my friends
come back for me.

13:49.195 --> 13:54.064
We're going to have to do
something about that arm.

13:57.169 --> 14:00.366
The waiter... from the tavern.

14:00.439 --> 14:02.703
Lieutenant Tom Paris,
our pilot,

14:02.775 --> 14:05.744
and B'Elanna Torres,
our Chief Engineer.

14:05.811 --> 14:10.043
That picture was taken
on your honeymoon.

14:10.115 --> 14:12.208
lt isn't possible.

14:12.284 --> 14:14.752
How else would we have it?

14:21.460 --> 14:24.224
lt's an antique television.

14:24.296 --> 14:27.231
You gave it to Tom
as a present.

14:27.299 --> 14:29.733
He watches cartoons.

14:29.835 --> 14:32.269
Yes.

14:32.338 --> 14:35.273
How do l know that?

14:35.341 --> 14:38.310
Because you're starting
to remember.

14:55.361 --> 14:58.990
l wondered why he was
so protective of me.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.199
l'll be outside
if you need me.

15:30.162 --> 15:32.187
Your shift ended
three hours ago.

15:32.264 --> 15:38.760
My friend Jaffen,
Employee 1326-- he cut himself.

15:38.871 --> 15:41.101
Removing property from these
premises is not permitted.

15:41.173 --> 15:42.902
l know, but he's just
too stubborn to go

15:42.975 --> 15:44.704
to the hospital.

15:44.777 --> 15:48.406
l promise l'll have it back
first thing in the morning.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.846
Be sure that you do.

16:05.898 --> 16:09.857
Display the personnel file
for Employee 8583.

16:09.935 --> 16:11.527
Access restricted.

16:11.637 --> 16:14.197
Security clearance verified.

16:17.609 --> 16:20.544
Display all medical
and historical data

16:20.612 --> 16:22.637
for this employee's species.

16:22.715 --> 16:23.647
Data unavailable.

16:23.716 --> 16:27.709
List all files accessed
by this employee

16:27.786 --> 16:28.548
since he's been here.

16:28.620 --> 16:30.053
Personnel files:

16:30.122 --> 16:34.058
Employee 8582:
Nozawa, Kashimuro.

16:34.126 --> 16:38.085
Employee 8584:
Janeway, Kathryn.

16:38.163 --> 16:41.394
Employee 8585:

16:41.467 --> 16:44.732
Employee 8586:

16:44.837 --> 16:48.136
Employee 8587:
Anderson, Lydia.

16:48.207 --> 16:51.643
Employee 8588:
Torres, B'Elanna. Employee...

16:51.710 --> 16:54.975
You need a doctor.

16:57.016 --> 17:00.884
That'll have to wait
till l'm back on Voyager.

17:00.953 --> 17:03.148
Voyager?.

17:03.222 --> 17:04.814
My ship.

17:04.890 --> 17:07.154
You live onboard?

17:07.226 --> 17:10.662
For almost seven years.

17:10.729 --> 17:14.186
Don't you ever want
to stay in one place?

17:18.771 --> 17:20.829
You seem happy here.

17:20.939 --> 17:22.873
l've got a good job.

17:22.941 --> 17:26.137
Ever consider doing something
more challenging?

17:26.211 --> 17:28.975
My job's challenging enough.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.811
You monitor reactor coils,

17:30.883 --> 17:32.680
right?

17:32.751 --> 17:34.878
You're obviously
a very capable woman.

17:34.987 --> 17:37.285
You could probably run
that power plant.

17:37.356 --> 17:40.018
Why would l want
all that responsibility?

17:41.994 --> 17:43.154
What's that?

17:43.228 --> 17:45.924
My people are trying
to contact me.

17:47.633 --> 17:48.622
Chakotay here.

17:48.700 --> 17:50.634
Are you okay, Commander?

17:50.702 --> 17:53.227
For the time being.
Can you get me out of here?

17:53.338 --> 17:54.305
No, sir.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.135
We're eight light-years away.

17:56.208 --> 17:58.676
How are you transmitting
a signal that far?

17:58.777 --> 18:01.610
We're using a triaxilating
frequency on a covariant

18:01.680 --> 18:02.612
subspace band.

18:02.681 --> 18:04.615
lt was B'Elanna's idea.

18:04.683 --> 18:07.811
l take it she's feeling better.

18:07.886 --> 18:09.820
She's responded well
to treatment.

18:09.888 --> 18:12.015
Have you located anyone else
from the crew?

18:12.091 --> 18:16.289
As a matter of fact, l'm sitting
with Captain Janeway right now.

18:16.361 --> 18:17.487
How is she?

18:17.563 --> 18:19.497
A little... suspicious,

18:19.565 --> 18:22.534
just like B'Elanna was
at first.

18:22.634 --> 18:25.364
How soon can you get back
into transporter range?

18:25.471 --> 18:27.598
We'll need a couple more days
to finish repairs.

18:27.706 --> 18:28.832
What about the shield grid?

18:28.974 --> 18:30.498
l have an idea
how to shut it down.

18:30.609 --> 18:34.045
Until l get back to you,
let's maintain com silence,

18:34.146 --> 18:36.512
just in case
we're being monitored.

18:36.582 --> 18:39.710
Understood.
Good luck, Commander.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.810
Why did you call me ''Captain''?

18:42.921 --> 18:45.355
Because that's who you are.

18:45.424 --> 18:47.722
That's absurd.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.556
So what are you saying?

18:49.628 --> 18:51.220
That l was brought
here by force, too?

18:51.296 --> 18:52.729
That my memories
were manipulated?

18:52.798 --> 18:54.766
l know it sounds strange, but...

18:54.833 --> 18:56.061
Helping you was a mistake.

18:58.270 --> 18:59.532
Listen to me.

19:01.106 --> 19:03.074
There are more than a hundred
members of Voyager's crew

19:03.142 --> 19:05.508
working at that power plant--
your crew.

19:05.577 --> 19:07.101
And when our ship gets here,

19:07.179 --> 19:09.044
l'll be able to prove it to you.

19:09.114 --> 19:11.139
Look...

19:11.216 --> 19:14.276
l don't want to force you to do
anything you don't want to,

19:14.353 --> 19:16.981
but don't you at least want
to know the truth?

19:17.055 --> 19:19.580
Let me prove who l am.

19:19.658 --> 19:21.751
Hand me that dermal regenerator.

19:43.148 --> 19:45.639
We're the same race.

19:49.888 --> 19:51.879
We're more than that.

19:51.957 --> 19:53.925
We're friends.

19:59.965 --> 20:02.058
Am l hearing you correctly?

20:02.167 --> 20:05.261
You're actually
helping this man?

20:07.739 --> 20:10.640
He abducted one of the workers.

20:10.709 --> 20:13.109
She's a member of his crew.

20:13.178 --> 20:15.840
Right... and you're the Captain.

20:15.914 --> 20:19.372
Don't you see
he's trying to convince you

20:19.451 --> 20:22.648
that you'll have a better life
if you go with him.

20:22.721 --> 20:26.157
Do you want to go with him?

20:26.225 --> 20:27.783
No.

20:27.859 --> 20:31.488
Then why are you risking
everything we have?

20:37.436 --> 20:38.698
l was starting to think...

20:39.771 --> 20:40.863
Stay where you are.

20:52.117 --> 20:53.778
l don't know them.

20:53.852 --> 20:55.376
l think you do,

20:55.454 --> 20:57.012
and l think you were involved

20:57.122 --> 20:58.646
in their disappearance.

21:00.359 --> 21:02.793
l'm not the man
you're looking for.

21:02.861 --> 21:05.421
Yes, the witness' description
doesn't fit you exactly,

21:05.497 --> 21:06.589
but l'm sure
that'll be explained

21:06.665 --> 21:08.098
once the doctor here
finds evidence

21:08.166 --> 21:10.828
of dermal regeneration.

21:12.904 --> 21:13.893
What is it?

21:14.039 --> 21:17.907
Some kind of...
communications device

21:17.976 --> 21:20.240
implanted under his skin.

21:20.312 --> 21:21.904
Remove it.

21:25.350 --> 21:26.612
Listen to me.

21:26.685 --> 21:28.585
You and l have
something in common.

21:28.654 --> 21:30.087
Oh?

21:30.155 --> 21:32.089
We're both investigating
disappearances.

21:32.157 --> 21:33.647
lf you answer my questions,

21:33.725 --> 21:34.692
l'll answer yours.

21:37.462 --> 21:38.451
l have an order

21:38.530 --> 21:41.192
to transfer this
patient to Division 6.

21:41.266 --> 21:42.961
Division 6?

21:43.101 --> 21:44.090
Neuropathology.

21:44.202 --> 21:45.726
We have reason to believe
that he's mentally ill.

21:45.837 --> 21:47.771
He's lying.
How could they know that?

21:47.839 --> 21:48.771
They've never examined me.

21:48.840 --> 21:50.205
l'll come with you.

21:50.275 --> 21:51.708
l'm sorry, sir, but my orders

21:51.777 --> 21:53.711
are to bring him for
immediate treatment.

21:53.779 --> 21:55.371
This man is a suspect
in a serious crime.

21:55.447 --> 21:57.312
l'm not letting him
out of my sight.

21:57.382 --> 21:59.179
lf you check the order,
you'll see it's been approved

21:59.251 --> 22:01.014
by the Director
of lnvestigations.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.815
My real name is Chakotay.

22:07.893 --> 22:10.521
l'm an officer aboard the
Federation Starship Voyager.

22:10.595 --> 22:12.187
Members of my crew
were abducted,

22:12.264 --> 22:14.255
and their memories were altered,
and they were put to work here.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.891
l can give you names,
descriptions!

22:16.068 --> 22:18.593
Listen to me!

22:19.705 --> 22:22.173
Ah...

22:26.044 --> 22:27.477
Smells good.

22:27.546 --> 22:28.911
Pancakes with maple syrup

22:28.980 --> 22:31.141
are your favorite breakfast.

22:31.216 --> 22:32.148
You know,

22:32.217 --> 22:34.651
sometimes food
is like time travel.

22:34.720 --> 22:37.951
You inhale an aroma,
take a bite of something,

22:38.056 --> 22:39.819
and suddenly, bam,
you're back at the moment

22:39.891 --> 22:42.951
you first tasted it.

22:43.061 --> 22:44.289
They're good.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.888
l'm not experiencing
time travel.

22:47.933 --> 22:49.195
What are you reading?

22:49.301 --> 22:50.928
Personal logs.

22:51.036 --> 22:53.766
Do you remember
recording any of them?

22:53.872 --> 22:56.102
Oh, they're not mine;
they're Tom's.

22:57.175 --> 22:59.609
Those are supposed
to be private.

22:59.678 --> 23:01.942
Well, he is my husband.

23:03.014 --> 23:03.981
What do they say?

23:04.049 --> 23:07.018
They're private...

23:08.086 --> 23:10.680
..but the way he
describes me...

23:10.756 --> 23:12.747
He loves you.

23:12.824 --> 23:16.385
l guess so.

23:16.461 --> 23:18.122
How do you feel?

23:19.965 --> 23:22.490
lt's still a little foggy.

23:22.601 --> 23:23.898
That fog should lift.

23:24.035 --> 23:26.094
as soon as the Doctor
finishes your treatments.

23:26.204 --> 23:28.468
Yeah...

23:28.540 --> 23:32.772
but what about the guy
who recorded these logs?

23:32.844 --> 23:34.311
l've been analyzing
our scans

23:34.379 --> 23:36.472
of the Quarren patrol
ships that attacked us,

23:36.548 --> 23:38.482
and l think l've devised a way

23:38.550 --> 23:40.108
of evading their sensors.

23:40.185 --> 23:42.619
You do have a knack
for tactical planning.

23:42.687 --> 23:43.619
Hmm. That's something

23:43.688 --> 23:45.383
l've been meaning
to discuss with you.

23:45.457 --> 23:47.118
Once we've succeeded
in this mission,

23:47.192 --> 23:48.284
and l'm certain we will,

23:48.360 --> 23:50.055
l'd like you to
help me program

23:50.128 --> 23:52.323
a new medical hologram.

23:53.398 --> 23:54.490
You don't like the idea

23:54.566 --> 23:55.658
of going back to your old job

23:55.734 --> 23:57.201
now that you've had a taste
of command.

23:57.269 --> 23:58.896
l'm a skilled officer.

23:59.004 --> 24:01.973
No offense, Doc, but that
skill was programmed into you.

24:02.073 --> 24:03.131
-Yes, but...
-l'm sure

24:03.241 --> 24:04.367
once you're back
to your old self,

24:04.443 --> 24:06.172
you'll be happy
being a full-time doctor

24:06.244 --> 24:08.303
again.

24:11.016 --> 24:14.247
Commander Chakotay's
hailing us.

24:14.319 --> 24:16.082
We're receiving you, sir.
Go ahead.

24:16.154 --> 24:18.418
l'm having trouble
with my transceiver.

24:18.490 --> 24:20.583
This may be to last chance
we have to talk.

24:20.659 --> 24:22.024
What's your status?

24:22.093 --> 24:25.085
l'm almost ready
to shut down the shield grid.

24:25.163 --> 24:27.688
l'm sending you
encrypted instructions.

24:27.766 --> 24:30.166
They'll tell you where
and when to enter orbit.

24:30.268 --> 24:32.293
We have it, Commander.

24:32.404 --> 24:34.668
Chakotay out.

24:34.739 --> 24:37.207
Well, now you know
where to find Voyager...

24:37.275 --> 24:38.469
l'll have three ships with me.

24:38.543 --> 24:39.942
They won't escape again.

24:40.045 --> 24:41.945
lf you'd done your
job the first time,

24:42.047 --> 24:44.641
we wouldn't have
a problem now.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.482
Don't you have patients
to attend to?

24:51.556 --> 24:53.490
Uh, yes, sir.

24:53.558 --> 24:54.957
l've been thinking.

24:55.093 --> 24:56.560
This is the second
person we've admitted

24:56.628 --> 24:58.255
with Dysphoria
Syndrome in two days,

24:58.330 --> 24:59.922
and they both work
at the power plant.

24:59.998 --> 25:01.829
Maybe we should
issue a health alert,

25:01.933 --> 25:03.560
examine the rest
of the workers.

25:03.635 --> 25:05.728
Do you think
l'm incompetent?

25:05.837 --> 25:07.429
Sir?

25:07.539 --> 25:10.133
This man is in charge
of personnel

25:10.242 --> 25:11.869
at the power facility.

25:12.010 --> 25:14.535
l've informed him
of the situation.

25:14.613 --> 25:15.705
We're already taking steps

25:15.780 --> 25:16.712
to ensure the safety

25:16.781 --> 25:19.409
of all of our employees.

25:19.484 --> 25:22.078
l'm sorry to have bothered you.

25:22.153 --> 25:24.781
No need to apologize, Doctor.

25:24.856 --> 25:27.188
Your concern for your patients
is admirable,

25:27.259 --> 25:28.191
but don't worry.

25:28.260 --> 25:31.423
The man is already
responding to treatment.

25:31.496 --> 25:33.964
l expect a full recovery.

25:37.369 --> 25:38.700
Why would this Tuvok
be collecting

25:38.803 --> 25:40.134
information about
his coworkers?

25:40.205 --> 25:41.433
l don't know,

25:41.540 --> 25:44.168
but the name on one of those
files is B'Elanna Torres.

25:44.242 --> 25:48.110
They both began working
at the plant on the same day,

25:48.179 --> 25:51.444
along with 136 others,
including myself.

25:51.516 --> 25:53.916
What's unusual about that?

25:53.985 --> 25:57.250
More than 100 skilled employees,
most of them the same species,

25:57.322 --> 25:59.756
acquired in a single day...

25:59.824 --> 26:01.291
during a labor shortage?

26:01.393 --> 26:03.122
You'll also note
that every one of them

26:03.161 --> 26:05.061
was processed
through the Central Hospital

26:05.130 --> 26:06.062
when they arrived.

26:06.131 --> 26:08.531
lt's routine for new
workers to be examined.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.158
Yes, by Quarantine Control,

26:10.268 --> 26:11.826
but everyone on this list--

26:11.970 --> 26:12.959
all of them--

26:13.071 --> 26:15.232
were processed
through Division 6.

26:15.340 --> 26:18.400
You came through
Neuropathology?

26:18.510 --> 26:20.068
That's what
the records indicate,

26:20.145 --> 26:22.170
but l don't remember
being there.

26:24.082 --> 26:26.812
What do you expect me to do?

26:26.885 --> 26:28.614
You can start
by interviewing Mr. Tuvok.

26:28.687 --> 26:30.314
You'll find him
at the hospital.

26:30.388 --> 26:31.355
Why is he there?

26:32.424 --> 26:35.450
He became
emotionally unstable.

26:35.527 --> 26:38.792
Even if l wanted to
help you, l couldn't.

26:38.863 --> 26:40.194
Why not?

26:40.265 --> 26:41.892
The Director of lnvestigations

26:42.000 --> 26:43.865
relieved me of duty
this morning.

26:44.936 --> 26:47.234
Yerid, l thought that was you.

26:47.305 --> 26:49.773
Have you found out
anything about B'Elanna?

26:49.874 --> 26:51.068
He can't assist you.

26:51.142 --> 26:53.838
He's been relieved of duty.

26:53.912 --> 26:54.844
Oh.

26:54.913 --> 26:56.540
This man's also in Tuvok's file.

26:58.483 --> 26:59.507
What file?

27:00.485 --> 27:02.146
Why don't you tell him?

27:02.220 --> 27:04.120
Tell me what?

27:04.189 --> 27:06.953
l can't go back to the hospital
and start asking questions.

27:07.025 --> 27:10.825
l'd be reported.

27:10.962 --> 27:13.988
Maybe l can help.

27:14.099 --> 27:18.195
Recently, l've been...

27:18.303 --> 27:20.362
l'm a doctor.
You can trust me.

27:23.475 --> 27:26.035
l've been experiencing...

27:26.111 --> 27:28.204
some disturbing thoughts.

27:28.279 --> 27:29.871
l don't believe
it's anything serious,

27:30.015 --> 27:31.744
but l would like
to speak with someone.

27:31.816 --> 27:34.444
Well, you've come
to the right place.

27:39.824 --> 27:44.056
Guest Labor Code Green,
Employee 8586.

27:46.865 --> 27:49.265
Hansen, Annika.

27:49.334 --> 27:51.427
You've been a
patient here before.

27:51.536 --> 27:54.130
Yes, when l first arrived.

27:54.239 --> 27:57.265
You were treated for
Dysphoria Syndrome.

27:57.375 --> 27:59.969
l don't recall that.

28:00.045 --> 28:01.945
These disturbing
thoughts you mentioned--

28:02.013 --> 28:03.810
would you characterize
them as hallucinations?

28:03.915 --> 28:05.815
What's the cause
of this syndrome?

28:05.917 --> 28:08.147
We're-we're conducting
studies to determine that.

28:08.219 --> 28:10.483
Fortunately, we have one
of the foremost experts

28:10.622 --> 28:11.919
on the condition
working here.

28:11.990 --> 28:13.548
l'd like to speak
with this expert.

28:13.625 --> 28:15.593
-Well, Dr. Kadan's very busy.
-So am l.

28:15.660 --> 28:17.287
Perhaps l should return
when he's free.

28:17.362 --> 28:20.092
Uh, wait here.
l'll find him.

28:34.679 --> 28:35.873
Yes?

28:36.014 --> 28:37.106
My name is Yerid.

28:37.182 --> 28:38.877
l'm from Criminal
lnvestigations.

28:39.017 --> 28:40.450
How can l help you?

28:40.518 --> 28:42.850
Kathryn Janeway?

28:42.921 --> 28:44.513
Yes?

28:49.194 --> 28:52.254
Do you know this man?

28:54.866 --> 28:56.891
No.

28:57.001 --> 28:58.730
l thought maybe
you'd met him.

28:58.837 --> 29:00.202
Why?

29:00.305 --> 29:02.102
He was found
in your former living quarters,

29:02.140 --> 29:03.664
in possession
of a dermal regenerator

29:03.775 --> 29:05.675
that you removed
from the plant.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.006
l was the one
who helped him.

29:07.078 --> 29:09.672
Jaffen...

29:15.920 --> 29:18.650
He said he was
from a starship,

29:18.723 --> 29:21.556
and that members of his crew
had been abducted.

29:21.626 --> 29:23.560
He was obviously lying.

29:23.628 --> 29:25.994
l want to know
everything he told you.

29:30.135 --> 29:31.727
How could she just walk out?

29:31.836 --> 29:33.770
She was a
voluntary patient.

29:33.838 --> 29:36.773
There was no reason
for Security to stop her.

29:36.841 --> 29:38.775
She accessed
64 restricted files,

29:38.843 --> 29:42.279
all of them for people diagnosed
with Dysphoria Syndrome.

29:42.347 --> 29:43.871
According to the records,

29:44.015 --> 29:46.449
those patients were
all admitted on the same day,

29:46.518 --> 29:47.883
and you're listed

29:48.019 --> 29:50.283
as the attending physician
in every case.

29:50.355 --> 29:51.481
Oh, yes, l remember.

29:51.556 --> 29:52.887
Quite-quite an outbreak.

29:53.024 --> 29:54.787
You've never mentioned it.

29:54.859 --> 29:56.884
Well, l'm sorry if
l haven't kept you

29:57.028 --> 29:59.121
properly informed
about my patients.

29:59.197 --> 30:00.892
Every one of them
was discharged

30:00.999 --> 30:02.489
to the Main Power Authority.

30:02.567 --> 30:03.761
That supervisor
you were talking to--

30:03.868 --> 30:05.096
that's where he worked.

30:05.203 --> 30:06.898
l explained that to you.

30:07.071 --> 30:11.007
l was informing him
about a potential health threat.

30:13.244 --> 30:15.508
That plant worker,
Amal Kotay--

30:15.580 --> 30:17.844
he claimed that his friends
had been abducted

30:17.916 --> 30:20.942
and put to work after having
their memories altered.

30:21.019 --> 30:22.953
What are you implying?

30:23.021 --> 30:26.650
You're making
false diagnoses,

30:26.724 --> 30:29.955
selectively changing
what people remember

30:30.061 --> 30:32.552
and then sending them
to work at the power plant.

30:33.698 --> 30:36.292
Very good, Doctor.

30:36.367 --> 30:38.631
Why?

30:38.736 --> 30:41.170
A physician with more experience

30:41.239 --> 30:44.470
would be able to see this
in the larger context.

30:44.542 --> 30:47.978
The true public health threat
is the labor shortage,

30:48.079 --> 30:51.412
and the only cure is to find
more skilled workers.

30:51.482 --> 30:54.645
We're doctors; we're not
supposed to harm patients.

30:54.719 --> 30:58.246
We're helping them to lead
productive, happy lives.

30:58.323 --> 30:59.950
By altering
their memories?

31:00.024 --> 31:02.185
The treatment l provide
improves their lives

31:02.293 --> 31:04.557
and makes them
better workers.

31:04.596 --> 31:07.087
ln turn,
our economy benefits.

31:10.668 --> 31:13.102
You're profiting from this,
aren't you?

31:13.171 --> 31:14.866
Doesn't a physician deserve

31:14.973 --> 31:17.601
to be compensated
for his services?

31:17.675 --> 31:19.700
l'll report you.

31:19.811 --> 31:21.244
To whom?

31:21.312 --> 31:24.770
My research is funded
by the Ministry of Health.

31:24.849 --> 31:27.443
Well, Criminal
lnvestigations, then.

31:28.519 --> 31:30.749
As you may recall,

31:30.822 --> 31:33.916
the Director of lnvestigations
was the one who ordered

31:33.992 --> 31:38.588
Amal Kotay be placed
under my care.

31:39.664 --> 31:42.292
Does everyone know about this?

31:42.367 --> 31:46.133
Not everyone.
Just a few trusted associates.

31:47.238 --> 31:50.139
The question is:

31:50.208 --> 31:52.676
Are you going to be one of them?

31:56.080 --> 31:58.139
She's considered dangerous.

31:58.216 --> 32:00.047
She's never been in here.

32:00.151 --> 32:01.914
You're sure?

32:01.953 --> 32:04.717
l don't think
l'd forget that face.

32:04.789 --> 32:07.223
lf you do see her,
report it immediately.

32:07.292 --> 32:09.260
She needs to be hospitalized.

32:14.299 --> 32:16.096
lt's safe now.

32:20.705 --> 32:21.899
Thank you.

32:22.040 --> 32:23.905
Well, if you really
want to thank me,

32:23.975 --> 32:26.273
you can tell me
what's going on.

32:26.344 --> 32:29.245
lt appears this Chakotay
was telling the truth.

32:29.314 --> 32:31.248
So, uh, every worker
at the plant

32:31.316 --> 32:32.578
had their memories altered?

32:32.650 --> 32:34.311
l don't believe
it's every worker.

32:34.385 --> 32:36.615
Your name didn't appear
in Dr. Kadan's patient files,

32:36.688 --> 32:38.155
but mine did.

32:38.222 --> 32:39.587
So did yours.

32:39.657 --> 32:41.784
We should report this
to the authorities.

32:41.859 --> 32:43.121
l'll need more evidence

32:43.194 --> 32:45.924
before l start
making accusations.

32:45.997 --> 32:48.966
Chakotay said he had proof
of my real identity...

32:49.100 --> 32:51.330
aboard a ship called Voyager.

32:51.436 --> 32:53.563
How can we locate it?

32:53.671 --> 32:55.969
When his crew contacted him,

32:56.040 --> 32:58.304
they were using...

32:58.376 --> 33:00.640
a triaxilating frequency

33:00.745 --> 33:03.043
on a covariant subspace band.

33:03.081 --> 33:06.642
There's a subspace transponder
at the power plant.

33:09.921 --> 33:11.684
l'm going back to the plant

33:11.756 --> 33:14.190
to try to contact this ship.

33:14.258 --> 33:16.488
l understand if you don't want
to be involved.

33:16.561 --> 33:19.655
l've been involved
from the moment l met you.

33:19.731 --> 33:22.199
lf l were to return
to the hospital

33:22.266 --> 33:23.824
in your custody,

33:23.935 --> 33:26.802
it would give us an opportunity
to help Chakotay and Tuvok.

33:28.906 --> 33:30.305
l had to sedate her.

33:30.375 --> 33:32.434
She wouldn't
come voluntarily.

33:32.510 --> 33:35.104
Her condition's
obviously worsened.

33:35.179 --> 33:36.612
l'll treat her.

33:36.681 --> 33:40.048
There are some other patients
l'd like to interview.

33:43.688 --> 33:45.451
These people can't be disturbed.

33:51.129 --> 33:54.223
l suggest you comply.

34:02.774 --> 34:04.241
Be careful.

34:22.994 --> 34:23.891
We're being hailed.

34:24.027 --> 34:24.995
On screen.

34:27.297 --> 34:29.061
Starship Voyager...

34:29.167 --> 34:30.634
Captain?

34:30.735 --> 34:33.898
Why don't you
just call me Kathryn?

34:34.005 --> 34:36.337
Yes, ma'am.
Where's Commander Chakotay?

34:36.407 --> 34:37.897
Hospitalized.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.940
He told me

34:40.011 --> 34:44.710
you had proof...
of who some of us really are.

34:44.782 --> 34:46.306
We do.

34:46.384 --> 34:49.614
You're the woman
who was abducted.

34:49.687 --> 34:51.279
Chakotay was supposed
to deactivate the shield grid,

34:51.355 --> 34:54.380
so we could transport you
and the others to safety.

34:54.458 --> 34:56.427
lf you could find a way
to shut down main power,

34:56.494 --> 34:57.893
the shield grid
will go down, too.

34:57.962 --> 34:59.691
Will you help us?

35:02.200 --> 35:03.827
We're under attack.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.425
Three ships.

35:11.175 --> 35:13.473
Please, shut down
the shield gr...

35:23.788 --> 35:25.756
Jaffen?

35:29.627 --> 35:31.424
Stop!

35:49.814 --> 35:51.042
Don't move!

35:57.188 --> 35:59.452
Stay where you are.

36:10.067 --> 36:12.126
l hope you didn't think
l abandoned you.

36:12.236 --> 36:13.464
Never occurred to me.

36:13.571 --> 36:16.870
We need to shut down
the main generators.

36:19.076 --> 36:21.874
So much for evading
their sensors.

36:22.013 --> 36:23.173
The only way they
could've found us

36:23.247 --> 36:25.545
is if they knew
exactly where to look.

36:27.718 --> 36:30.380
Transporters are off-line.

36:36.894 --> 36:40.694
We'll never get to
the generator controls.

36:40.765 --> 36:43.256
Maybe we don't have to.

36:43.334 --> 36:44.824
What are you doing?

36:44.936 --> 36:46.528
lf l can make
the computer think

36:46.637 --> 36:48.070
the core is going to overload,

36:48.139 --> 36:51.438
the main power should
automatically shut down.

37:05.256 --> 37:08.123
Ask them to give us
some privacy.

37:08.192 --> 37:09.989
You're dismissed.

37:12.530 --> 37:14.259
Disconnect them.

37:19.003 --> 37:21.437
Dr. Ravoc?

37:21.505 --> 37:23.871
Why is this man here?

37:23.941 --> 37:26.637
Dysphoria Syndrome.

37:29.914 --> 37:32.712
We're losing shields.

37:32.783 --> 37:35.183
Any advice
from your tactical database?

37:35.253 --> 37:37.483
Nothing relevant.

37:37.555 --> 37:39.819
How many escape pods
do we have left?

37:39.890 --> 37:41.687
Five.

37:41.759 --> 37:43.192
Stand by to eject three of them.

37:43.261 --> 37:45.525
l don't think abandoning ship
is the answer.

37:45.596 --> 37:47.257
Neither do l.
Can you create a dampening field

37:47.331 --> 37:49.322
around the briefing room
that'll mask our life signs?

37:49.400 --> 37:51.061
l believe so. Why?

37:51.168 --> 37:52.658
Watch and learn.

38:01.445 --> 38:03.470
Your crew's abandoned you again.

38:03.547 --> 38:05.811
l suggest you surrender
your vessel.

38:05.883 --> 38:09.751
You should realize by now that
l'm not programmed to do that.

38:17.695 --> 38:19.026
Bravo, Ensign.

38:19.096 --> 38:21.462
B'Elanna, l need
those transporters.

38:22.733 --> 38:24.826
You better hurry up.

38:24.935 --> 38:28.336
Come on... do it.

38:28.406 --> 38:32.206
Warning. Core overload detected.

38:32.276 --> 38:35.074
lnitiating emergency shutdown.

38:37.214 --> 38:38.704
We've got to go!

38:47.124 --> 38:48.853
Their shield grid's failing.

38:49.627 --> 38:51.185
B'Elanna?

38:51.262 --> 38:53.696
Transporters are coming
on line... now!

39:08.546 --> 39:11.037
ECH Log, supplemental.

39:11.115 --> 39:13.811
All the crew have been
transported back to Voyager,

39:13.951 --> 39:16.215
and thanks to my experience
with Lieutenant Torres,

39:16.287 --> 39:18.687
their treatment
is proceeding rapidly.

39:18.756 --> 39:20.018
While they're recovering,

39:20.091 --> 39:22.821
l still have a few command
duties left to perform.

39:22.893 --> 39:24.656
lf it weren't
for your efforts,

39:24.729 --> 39:28.028
this whole conspiracy might
never have been uncovered.

39:28.099 --> 39:29.589
What'll happen to the workers?

39:29.667 --> 39:30.964
Well, we've identified
several thousand

39:31.068 --> 39:32.831
of Dr. Kadan's patients.

39:32.970 --> 39:34.835
Once they're treated,
they'll be repatriated.

39:34.905 --> 39:36.839
We appreciate everything
you've done.

39:36.907 --> 39:38.534
This way.

40:06.303 --> 40:09.101
Ooh!

40:20.317 --> 40:22.410
What's that for?

40:22.486 --> 40:24.215
For taking care of me,

40:24.288 --> 40:27.280
even when you didn't know
who l was.

40:31.328 --> 40:32.955
Ow!

40:33.030 --> 40:34.327
What was that for?

40:34.398 --> 40:36.593
Flirting with your customers.

40:36.667 --> 40:39.966
l was a victim of mind control.

40:41.405 --> 40:42.963
Mm-hmm.

40:56.687 --> 40:59.121
l can see why
you'd rather live here.

40:59.190 --> 41:01.488
l'd offer you a position.

41:01.592 --> 41:04.686
l could always use
another skilled engineer.

41:04.728 --> 41:07.993
But as the Captain...

41:08.065 --> 41:11.899
it wouldn't really be
appropriate for me to...

41:12.002 --> 41:14.163
Fraternize with a member
of your crew.

41:16.373 --> 41:19.069
Well, at least my memories
weren't tampered with.

41:19.143 --> 41:20.940
According
to the medical reports,

41:21.011 --> 41:23.946
l really did come to Quarra
looking for a better life,

41:24.048 --> 41:27.211
and now that l've been promoted,
l guess l've succeeded.

41:27.284 --> 41:29.218
Promotion?

41:29.286 --> 41:32.722
They had to replace
our shift supervisor.

41:32.790 --> 41:36.419
Something about acquiring
workers illegally.

41:36.494 --> 41:37.825
Congratulations.

41:37.895 --> 41:40.090
You deserve it.

41:40.164 --> 41:41.495
l thought you might

41:41.565 --> 41:42.930
like these back...

41:43.033 --> 41:47.231
to remind you
of our time together.

41:47.338 --> 41:50.899
l won't need souvenirs
to remember you.

42:14.231 --> 42:16.461
Captain on the Bridge!

42:34.685 --> 42:36.346
Ready to go?

42:36.420 --> 42:39.787
lt may not have been real,
Chakotay,

42:39.857 --> 42:41.791
but it felt like home.

42:41.859 --> 42:43.884
lf you hadn't come after me,

42:43.961 --> 42:48.295
l never would've known
that l had another life.

42:48.365 --> 42:50.697
Are you sorry l showed up?

42:53.470 --> 42:55.461
Not for a second.

42:57.608 --> 43:00.236
Resume course, Mr. Paris.

43:00.344 --> 43:02.335
Aye, sir.
