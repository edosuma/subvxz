01:25.285 --> 01:26.980
<i>Good morning, America.</i>

01:28.121 --> 01:30.055
<i>It's now 12 noon</i>
<i>in Salamanca, Spain.</i>

01:30.457 --> 01:33.517
<i>In a short time, world leaders</i>
<i>from over 150 countries...</i>

01:33.693 --> 01:35.183
<i>... meet here in Plaza Mayor...</i>

01:35.361 --> 01:38.888
<i>... to sign up to President Ashton's</i>
<i>bold new counterterrorist strategy.</i>

01:39.065 --> 01:41.761
<i>Since 9/11, more than 4500 people</i>
<i>have been killed...</i>

01:41.935 --> 01:44.403
<i>... in the rising tide of global terror.</i>

01:44.604 --> 01:46.902
<i>Those lives will not</i>
<i>soon be forgotten...</i>

01:47.073 --> 01:50.634
<i>... as today, the world comes together</i>
<i>to take a stand against this violence.</i>

01:50.810 --> 01:53.370
<i>We may be on the brink</i>
<i>of a historic agreement...</i>

01:53.546 --> 01:55.514
<i>... between Western</i>
<i>and Arab leaders.</i>

01:55.682 --> 01:58.116
<i>Security services are on high alert</i>
<i>in Salamanca...</i>

01:58.284 --> 02:01.515
<i>... where we go live to our news team</i>
<i>and our reporter Angie Jones.</i>

02:01.688 --> 02:03.383
Five, four, three, two...

02:03.556 --> 02:07.822
I am standing inside Plaza Mayor
in Salamanca, Spain...

02:07.994 --> 02:10.554
...where crowds have lined up
for the kickoff of...

02:10.729 --> 02:12.857
<i>... what is without question</i>
<i>a landmark summit.</i>

02:13.032 --> 02:15.227
<i>For months,</i>
<i>President Ashton's been working...</i>

02:15.401 --> 02:17.392
<i>... with leaders</i>
<i>from five continents...</i>

02:17.570 --> 02:21.700
<i>... to forge a new groundbreaking</i>
<i>alliance in the ongoing war on terror.</i>

02:21.875 --> 02:23.433
<i>And now here, today...</i>

02:23.610 --> 02:26.306
<i>... Western and Arab leaders</i>
<i>will meet for the first time...</i>

02:26.479 --> 02:28.606
<i>... to formalize this new coalition...</i>

02:28.781 --> 02:30.681
...designed to once and for all...

02:30.850 --> 02:33.478
...put a stranglehold
on international terrorism.

02:33.653 --> 02:34.779
- Bring him up.
- Cue Mark.

02:34.954 --> 02:38.048
- <i>Tell us, Angie, what's the mood like?</i>
- <i>For the most part, hopeful.</i>

02:38.224 --> 02:40.556
<i>Everyone here is very</i>
<i>sympathetic to those...</i>

02:40.727 --> 02:42.820
<i>... who lost loved ones</i>
<i>in the recent bombing.</i>

02:42.996 --> 02:44.896
<i>I did, however, speak to delegates...</i>

02:45.064 --> 02:46.395
What's she doing?

02:46.566 --> 02:50.229
<i>... both of whom took a hard line,</i>
<i>suggesting that U.S. foreign policy...</i>

02:50.403 --> 02:51.563
Kevin, shut her down.

02:51.738 --> 02:54.468
<i>... has to bear some responsibility</i>
<i>for the recent events.</i>

02:54.641 --> 02:56.905
<i>Thanks, Angie.</i>
<i>You'll have to keep us informed.</i>

02:57.076 --> 03:00.170
- What the hell was that?
- <i>Not everyone loves us, Rex.</i>

03:00.346 --> 03:04.077
Why don't you leave the punditry
to someone paid to have an opinion?

03:04.250 --> 03:07.151
<i>I'm cool with censorship.</i>
<i>I know the American people love that.</i>

03:07.554 --> 03:10.580
- Come on, Angie. Lighten up.
- <i>Got it.</i>

03:10.757 --> 03:11.917
- Gallery.
- <i>Pass me over.</i>

03:12.091 --> 03:13.422
- Bruce.
- Yes.

03:13.593 --> 03:16.653
- <i>What was that? Stick to the script.</i>
- I told her. Wanna tell her?

03:16.829 --> 03:17.989
- Fine.
- <i>That's fine.</i>

03:24.938 --> 03:27.270
- Who is the clown on two?
- Two is Luis.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.032
Camera two, are you gonna move?

03:29.209 --> 03:31.439
We're here for the summit,
not the sideshow.

03:33.246 --> 03:35.339
Man, it's like training
a freaking dog.

03:35.748 --> 03:38.410
Okay, everybody,
the president is about to arrive.

03:38.585 --> 03:41.554
When he does, we're on him.
Let's get our ducks in a row.

03:51.731 --> 03:54.256
Three, wider.
Four, stay where you are.

03:54.434 --> 03:56.231
Kevin, keep it moving.
I'm dying here.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.936
Camera five,
give me the motorcade.

04:07.447 --> 04:10.610
Number seven, concentrate.
I wanna go close on the president.

04:15.955 --> 04:17.216
All right, sir.

04:19.225 --> 04:20.351
That's good.

04:20.526 --> 04:22.687
Tighten up, five. Good.

04:23.029 --> 04:25.463
- Isn't that?
- It's Thomas Barnes.

04:27.567 --> 04:30.900
Why didn't we know he was here?
Shit, Grace. We should've had this.

04:31.070 --> 04:32.401
Yeah, I don't...

04:32.572 --> 04:35.132
- Kevin, pull the archives.
- Pull the archives, please.

04:35.308 --> 04:37.970
The president's approaching
the plaza. All cameras ready.

04:38.144 --> 04:39.406
Angie, we're back in 20.

04:39.579 --> 04:42.878
And remember, we're here
for the summit, not the sideshow.

04:43.049 --> 04:45.279
- <i>There are other stories.</i>
- I don't give a shit.

04:45.451 --> 04:49.251
Unless the protesters set themselves
on fire, they're not our story.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.462
- Kevin, you got it?
- Yeah.

05:02.001 --> 05:03.161
Check this out.

05:09.008 --> 05:12.671
This was only last year.
I can't believe he's back already.

05:14.280 --> 05:16.145
If we're the only ones
who have this...

05:16.316 --> 05:20.275
He won't talk. A year ago we had Hill,
we had that guy who saved Reagan.

05:20.453 --> 05:21.511
- McCarthy.
- All of them.

05:21.688 --> 05:24.088
A hero piece.
Barnes wanted nothing to do with it.

05:24.257 --> 05:25.281
That was then.

05:25.458 --> 05:29.690
It's a shame. It would've made a great
side story. We've no time to work it in.

05:30.463 --> 05:33.694
That was then, this is now,
okay, guys? We've got our story.

05:34.434 --> 05:36.197
Okay, cue graphics.

05:36.369 --> 05:37.802
Camera five, give me a single.

05:37.970 --> 05:40.632
- Here comes the mayor.
- Three, four, ready at the podium.

05:40.807 --> 05:44.834
Three, wide. Four, in close. Start with
the leaders and end with the mayor.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.502
- <i>Thank you so much for being here.</i>
- Three, pull back.

05:48.614 --> 05:51.481
Yes. Camera six, get ready.
We're coming to you.

05:52.719 --> 05:54.710
Good. That's good.

05:54.887 --> 05:57.788
- Two, give me crowds.
- De Soto speech ending in one minute.

05:57.957 --> 06:00.949
Camera five, give me something else
to work with. That's good.

06:01.127 --> 06:04.619
Angie, when this is over,
I want a 15-second fill to wrap it up.

06:04.797 --> 06:07.391
- Keep it simple.
- <i>You mean dumb it down?</i>

06:07.567 --> 06:09.159
Get off it, Angie. Come on.

06:09.335 --> 06:10.632
She's unbelievable.

06:10.803 --> 06:12.828
<i>I offer you my city...</i>

06:13.005 --> 06:15.906
The mayor's done in five.
Ready with the graphics.

06:16.075 --> 06:18.703
<i>This summit could be the</i>
<i>defining moment of his presidency.</i>

06:18.878 --> 06:20.573
Pull out, four, three...

06:23.316 --> 06:24.715
Oh, my God.

06:25.818 --> 06:27.945
<i>The president appears</i>
<i>to have been shot.</i>

06:28.187 --> 06:30.246
- Shit.
- <i>I heard two shots...</i>

06:30.423 --> 06:32.448
- <i>... and the president fell.</i>
- Who's that guy?

06:32.625 --> 06:33.990
What's he doing?

06:34.160 --> 06:37.254
Okay, five, stay with that guy.
Everyone else, give me Ashton.

06:37.430 --> 06:40.194
Three, stick with the president.
Just stay with him.

06:40.633 --> 06:43.830
That's good. Just stay with him.
Stay with him. Hold it there.

06:44.203 --> 06:45.534
This is insane.

06:45.972 --> 06:47.303
Yeah, yeah. I'm coming back.

06:47.473 --> 06:50.135
- Camera three, do better.
- <i>They're not letting me through.</i>

06:50.309 --> 06:52.436
Don't give me this bullshit.
Figure it out.

06:52.745 --> 06:54.144
<i>Okay, you got him?</i>

06:55.915 --> 06:58.475
- What was that?
- <i>There appears to be an explosion...</i>

06:58.651 --> 07:01.313
Camera four, turn around.
Find out what that was.

07:01.487 --> 07:04.752
Kevin, get playback going. We have
to uplink everything we've got.

07:04.924 --> 07:07.256
- Bruce.
- Uplink VTs 1 through 7 on my monitor.

07:09.462 --> 07:11.293
Okay, Angie, you're on. Let's go.

07:12.698 --> 07:14.791
We're live, Angie. This is it. Go.

07:15.868 --> 07:17.597
<i>I need a minute, Rex. All right?</i>

07:17.770 --> 07:19.362
Shit. Get Mark to stretch.

07:19.539 --> 07:22.007
I know this is tough, okay?
I know that.

07:22.175 --> 07:24.268
We need you to tell us
what's going on.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.435
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Focus, okay?

07:26.612 --> 07:28.546
<i>Angie? Please, tell us</i>
<i>what you're seeing.</i>

07:28.714 --> 07:31.308
- Deep breath. Go.
- <i>The president of the United States...</i>

07:31.484 --> 07:34.783
<i>... has been shot.</i>
<i>There have been several gunshots.</i>

07:34.954 --> 07:38.651
<i>It appears there was also a bomb</i>
<i>that went off outside the plaza.</i>

07:38.825 --> 07:40.383
<i>There are people running scared...</i>

07:42.662 --> 07:43.686
Oh, shit!

07:54.407 --> 07:55.897
Mark?

07:56.843 --> 07:58.504
Mark, you gotta fill.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.712
<i>It seems that a huge bomb...</i>

08:01.881 --> 08:05.146
Oh, my God. Angie! Angie!

08:05.318 --> 08:07.411
<i>At the moment,</i>
<i>smoke from the explosion...</i>

08:07.587 --> 08:10.522
<i>... mercifully covers the extent</i>
<i>of the human carnage.</i>

08:10.723 --> 08:12.714
<i>There must be many people dead</i>
<i>and injured.</i>

08:12.892 --> 08:14.883
- Angie.
- <i>This truly is terrible.</i>

08:15.061 --> 08:16.756
Come on, kiddo, get up.

08:18.664 --> 08:20.222
Get up.

08:27.940 --> 08:29.339
Kevin, pull the feed.

08:30.376 --> 08:32.139
Turn it off!

09:07.446 --> 09:09.004
<i>Good morning, America.</i>

09:09.181 --> 09:11.479
<i>It's now 12 noon</i>
<i>in Salamanca, Spain.</i>

09:11.651 --> 09:14.279
<i>In a short time, world leaders</i>
<i>from over 150 countries...</i>

09:14.453 --> 09:15.477
It's time.

09:15.655 --> 09:17.919
- <i>Plaza Mayor to sign up</i>
<i>to President Ashton's...</i>

09:18.090 --> 09:20.354
<i>... bold new</i>
<i>counterterrorist strategy.</i>

09:20.526 --> 09:23.086
<i>Since 9/11,</i>
<i>more than 4500 people...</i>

09:23.262 --> 09:25.856
<i>... have been killed</i>
<i>in the rising tide of global terror.</i>

09:26.032 --> 09:28.364
<i>Those lives will not</i>
<i>soon be forgotten, as today...</i>

09:28.534 --> 09:32.026
<i>... the world comes together</i>
<i>to take a stand against this violence.</i>

09:32.204 --> 09:34.638
<i>We may be on the brink</i>
<i>of a historic agreement...</i>

09:34.807 --> 09:36.741
<i>... between Western</i>
<i>and Arab leaders.</i>

09:36.909 --> 09:39.036
<i>Security services</i>
<i>are on high alert...</i>

10:21.187 --> 10:23.246
<i>All teams, this is Control.</i>

10:23.422 --> 10:25.913
- <i>Motorcade one minute to landing.</i>
- <i>Copy.</i>

10:26.459 --> 10:29.587
- <i>Level 4B, clear.</i>
- <i>Roger, Control.</i>

10:31.964 --> 10:33.659
- It was before he lost it.
- Come on.

10:33.833 --> 10:35.926
- Guy had a nervous breakdown.
- Six months ago.

10:36.102 --> 10:39.196
He's not that guy anymore.
Give him a break.

10:39.572 --> 10:41.733
What are the chances he freaks out
the minute we walk?

10:41.907 --> 10:43.636
I'd put it at fifty-fifty.

10:48.714 --> 10:50.045
We doing this?

10:57.657 --> 10:59.386
Mr. President.

11:10.336 --> 11:14.295
<i>All teams, this is Control.</i>
<i>Eagle is on the move.</i>

11:25.217 --> 11:27.151
<i>Tell us, Angie,</i>
<i>what's the mood there?</i>

11:27.319 --> 11:29.082
<i>For the most part, hopeful.</i>

11:29.255 --> 11:31.621
<i>Everyone here</i>
<i>is very sympathetic to those...</i>

11:31.791 --> 11:34.419
<i>... who lost loved ones</i>
<i>in the recent bombing.</i>

11:41.500 --> 11:43.092
Thanks.

11:44.503 --> 11:45.527
For what?

11:46.472 --> 11:48.167
For getting me back out here.

11:50.843 --> 11:52.708
Don't thank me yet.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.621
Mr. President?

12:12.998 --> 12:14.465
Here we go.

12:32.251 --> 12:33.582
All right, sir.

13:03.983 --> 13:05.575
What a beautiful baby.

13:08.487 --> 13:10.079
Thank you.

13:11.390 --> 13:13.017
Thank you so much.

13:14.026 --> 13:15.425
It's a wonderful day.

13:20.166 --> 13:21.565
Hey! Drop it.

13:24.637 --> 13:25.763
Not now.

13:31.076 --> 13:33.977
- Michael team's go for count off.
- All clear from above.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.548
- And south?
- Yeah. Here too.

13:37.716 --> 13:40.742
President Henry Ashton.

14:01.407 --> 14:05.241
Welcome. Thank you so much
for being here.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.579
This is a wondrous day.

14:09.748 --> 14:11.613
Today, we make history.

14:16.856 --> 14:21.589
Señor Presidente, fellow members
of the European Union...

14:21.961 --> 14:25.988
...our friends from Africa,
Middle East...

14:26.198 --> 14:29.793
...President Ashton,
citizens of the world...

14:30.703 --> 14:34.469
...it is with great pleasure
that I invite you all to our humble city.

14:37.543 --> 14:40.671
And it is with a sad heart...

14:40.846 --> 14:42.746
...that we must meet in mourning...

14:42.915 --> 14:47.079
...for those who lost loved ones
in the recent bombings.

14:47.686 --> 14:50.314
Back annex, the building
should have been cleared.

14:50.489 --> 14:52.457
<i>Copy. It's clear.</i>

14:54.293 --> 14:56.124
I've got a flutter on the second floor.

14:57.496 --> 15:00.021
Seventh window from the left.

15:00.199 --> 15:03.362
- <i>Copy. We'll check again.</i>
- The hopes of the world...

15:03.535 --> 15:06.003
...are with us.

15:06.171 --> 15:08.765
Let us not disappoint them.

15:10.676 --> 15:12.541
For we cannot today...

15:13.078 --> 15:17.208
...or ever, let the specter of evil...

15:17.383 --> 15:21.285
...overcome the hope
of a better tomorrow.

15:27.660 --> 15:30.788
It's just a fan that's been left on.
We got it.

15:34.934 --> 15:41.066
Therefore, I offer you my city,
my heart and my hope.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.512
Barnes!

15:57.022 --> 15:58.785
Barnes!

16:01.060 --> 16:02.925
- Barnes!
- Eagle's down!

16:03.095 --> 16:05.086
Repeat, Eagle's down!

16:08.767 --> 16:11.065
Got a GSW. Repeat, GSW.

16:11.437 --> 16:14.167
- Get him out of here!
- Move! Move!

16:14.340 --> 16:16.774
Move him! Go! Go, go, go!

16:16.942 --> 16:19.706
Pick him up! One, two, three.

16:19.878 --> 16:21.175
You got him?

16:21.780 --> 16:23.213
Find that shooter.

16:25.718 --> 16:28.619
Control, I want a perimeter
set a half block out.

16:28.787 --> 16:30.778
Sweep the buildings
along the back annex.

16:30.956 --> 16:33.117
No one goes in or out
without our go.

16:34.126 --> 16:35.650
- Okay, you got him?
- Veronica!

16:35.828 --> 16:37.125
- Control.
- Do something!

16:37.296 --> 16:39.594
Come in, Control!
I need a 20 on POTUS.

16:40.766 --> 16:42.825
Control. Come in, Control. Damn it!

16:43.002 --> 16:46.130
- Listen to me!
- I said back up! Hey, shut up!

16:46.305 --> 16:48.796
Listen! We are in danger.
We gotta get out of here!

16:48.974 --> 16:50.703
Now, get up! I said get up!

16:50.876 --> 16:52.468
- Let me have him.
- Let me go.

16:52.644 --> 16:53.804
Barnes.

16:53.979 --> 16:57.312
Why'd you run for the president?
Why did you run for the president?

16:57.483 --> 16:59.610
- Barnes, we're handling this.
- I hear bang.

16:59.785 --> 17:02.310
- I protect the mayor. It's my job!
- You got there pretty fast.

17:02.488 --> 17:05.012
- Barnes, he's a cop.
- I don't care, he knows something!

17:05.190 --> 17:06.817
Get him out of here! Get him out.

17:07.925 --> 17:09.119
Don't release him!

17:09.294 --> 17:12.092
I've been set up!
You got the wrong person!

17:14.733 --> 17:16.428
Control. Control, come in.

17:16.602 --> 17:18.160
There's no response from Control.

17:18.337 --> 17:20.828
I just spoke with them.
POTUS is secure.

17:23.509 --> 17:25.772
Till we find that shooter,
we're shutting the city down.

17:26.078 --> 17:27.511
This never should've happened.

17:27.679 --> 17:30.170
Except that it did.
And it happened on our watch.

17:30.482 --> 17:31.847
I can't live with that.

17:32.851 --> 17:34.341
We gotta find him.

17:39.425 --> 17:41.655
- Sir, we need your camera.
- Sure.

17:41.827 --> 17:44.022
- Where's the zoom?
- It's that right here.

17:45.264 --> 17:47.630
Right there.
That's where the flutter was.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.668
But the shot was up and to the left.

17:50.836 --> 17:52.201
Wait, you saw the shooter?

17:52.704 --> 17:56.196
No. But I saw something.
Like a flash of light.

17:56.375 --> 17:59.037
- I saw a man in that room, sir.
- I'll check it out.

17:59.211 --> 18:01.202
- I'm coming with you.
- No! No.

18:01.447 --> 18:03.438
If you're wrong, let me take the heat.

18:04.049 --> 18:06.040
Sir, did you film this entire thing?

18:06.218 --> 18:07.685
- Yes.
- Show me.

18:11.123 --> 18:13.182
I think I got the shooter on tape.

18:14.960 --> 18:16.222
Wait, go forward.

18:19.765 --> 18:22.859
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
There's a bomb at the podium!

19:02.307 --> 19:03.831
<i>There's a bomb at the podium!</i>

19:04.009 --> 19:05.476
<i>Everybody get down!</i>

19:06.044 --> 19:07.841
<i>This never should've happened.</i>

19:08.013 --> 19:09.241
<i>Find that shooter.</i>

19:13.952 --> 19:14.976
<i>Flash of light.</i>

19:20.692 --> 19:22.091
<i>Find that shooter.</i>

19:36.408 --> 19:39.468
He just walked. He just walked.

19:40.979 --> 19:44.415
Medic! We need a medic here!

19:44.583 --> 19:45.880
Barnes.

19:46.618 --> 19:48.643
We're gonna get you
some help, buddy.

19:55.561 --> 19:58.155
Barnes? Barnes.

20:00.632 --> 20:01.997
Anna?

20:05.938 --> 20:09.169
Hey! Hey, stop him! Stop him!

20:09.441 --> 20:10.965
Stop! Stop!

20:11.410 --> 20:12.434
Hey, freeze!

20:35.667 --> 20:38.500
Secret Service.
I need to see your tapes.

20:38.670 --> 20:40.501
Yeah. Kevin.

20:41.106 --> 20:44.371
I need to see any footage you have
of the back part of the plaza.

20:44.543 --> 20:46.977
- We need footage of the plaza.
- <i>How much do you need?</i>

20:47.145 --> 20:49.170
Just give me everything.

20:59.524 --> 21:02.220
Can you hear me?
Camera three, can you hear me?

21:03.028 --> 21:04.859
Just play it back from there.
Yeah.

21:05.230 --> 21:07.130
- <i>Barnes, you were right.</i>
- About what?

21:07.299 --> 21:10.632
<i>About the shooter. I'm in pursuit,</i>
<i>leaving the back annex, heading west.</i>

21:10.802 --> 21:12.292
<i>Repeat, heading west.</i>

21:12.471 --> 21:14.598
- Did you call it in?
- <i>No. No, I need you to.</i>

21:14.773 --> 21:16.365
- I got it. Go.
- Camera seven.

21:17.476 --> 21:20.877
Camera seven. This is Grace,
can you hear me?

21:21.179 --> 21:24.580
- Camera seven, can you hear me?
- Control? Come in, Control.

21:25.317 --> 21:27.251
Control, come in.

21:27.419 --> 21:28.977
- I need you to tell us...
- Damn it.

21:29.154 --> 21:31.554
Okay. We need you to tell us
where you are.

21:31.723 --> 21:35.557
This is Agent Barnes. Control is down.
My partner is in pursuit of a suspect.

21:35.727 --> 21:38.821
We need immediate assistance
just outside the back annex.

21:38.997 --> 21:40.555
Grace, they have a suspect.

21:40.732 --> 21:42.461
Headed west on the surface streets.

21:42.734 --> 21:44.429
- West.
- Do you copy?

21:44.603 --> 21:48.004
Camera six, if you can hear me,
turn around and go west.

21:48.173 --> 21:51.142
Camera six, if you can hear me,
turn around and go west.

21:51.443 --> 21:52.933
Backup is on its...

21:54.279 --> 21:55.803
<i>What?</i>

21:56.381 --> 21:57.848
<i>Barnes, what is it?</i>

22:00.252 --> 22:01.514
Rewind that.

22:01.687 --> 22:04.520
Six? Six, did you get all that?

22:05.891 --> 22:07.222
Stop.

22:12.130 --> 22:13.757
Oh, my God.

22:14.700 --> 22:17.294
What? What? What did he see?

22:54.606 --> 22:56.005
Next.

22:56.708 --> 22:58.608
Police, I work for the mayor.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.940
Are you armed?

23:04.950 --> 23:06.349
Are you armed?

23:06.518 --> 23:07.644
Yes.

23:09.187 --> 23:11.553
Okay, I'll turn it off. Go through.

23:16.661 --> 23:18.891
I'll be at the underpass.

23:33.445 --> 23:35.208
You have a glow about you.

23:35.547 --> 23:37.572
It's the heat.

23:38.016 --> 23:39.608
The heat?

23:41.453 --> 23:43.080
What have you been doing?

23:43.255 --> 23:44.415
Nothing.

23:44.589 --> 23:45.715
Taking in the crowd.

23:45.891 --> 23:47.859
Some more than others?

23:49.828 --> 23:51.159
I saw you just now.

23:51.329 --> 23:53.729
- You saw nothing.
- It didn't look like nothing.

23:53.899 --> 23:57.426
You don't have to worry about him,
I promise.

23:58.236 --> 23:59.328
Enrique.

23:59.504 --> 24:02.439
You're the one that I want,
there is no one else.

24:03.074 --> 24:06.202
How many ways do I need to say it?

24:09.181 --> 24:14.676
When you've finished here we'll go
away together, just you and me.

24:15.220 --> 24:16.778
I love you.

24:18.557 --> 24:21.025
Did you remember to bring my bag?

24:22.394 --> 24:24.055
Thank you.

24:25.931 --> 24:28.627
- I love you.
- I love you.

24:36.174 --> 24:39.803
Ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the United States:

24:40.111 --> 24:42.944
President Henry Ashton.

24:49.621 --> 24:53.318
Mr. Mayor, this is a great day.
It's an honor to be here.

25:00.599 --> 25:04.228
Welcome. Thank you so much
for being here.

25:04.569 --> 25:07.902
This is a wondrous day.

25:08.106 --> 25:10.904
Today, we make history.

25:21.219 --> 25:23.483
I'll be at the underpass.

25:27.092 --> 25:30.152
<i>You don't have to worry about him,</i>
<i>I promise.</i>

25:30.428 --> 25:33.556
<i>You're the one that I want,</i>
<i>there is no one else.</i>

25:33.732 --> 25:38.499
<i>When you've finished here we'll go</i>
<i>away together, just you and me.</i>

25:38.670 --> 25:40.365
- my heart and my hope.

26:00.792 --> 26:02.191
Get him out of here!

26:02.360 --> 26:03.793
Let's go, move it! Let's go!

26:03.962 --> 26:06.396
- Get moving!
- Let me go! I work for the mayor!

26:08.300 --> 26:10.393
- Shut up and move!
- Let me go!

26:10.569 --> 26:11.900
Hey. Who are you?

26:12.070 --> 26:15.267
Let's go. Who are you?
Look at me! Look!

26:15.440 --> 26:17.101
Hey! Who are you?

26:19.277 --> 26:21.871
Who are you? Who are you?

26:22.180 --> 26:25.775
Look at me, look at me! Look at me!
Answer the goddamn question.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.083
Why did you run?

26:30.288 --> 26:31.880
Answer the question.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.261
Veronica!

26:41.232 --> 26:44.099
- Veronica! Veronica!
- Hey, calm down!

26:44.269 --> 26:46.066
We have to go!

26:46.371 --> 26:47.861
We are all in danger!

26:48.039 --> 26:50.564
We have to go!
She threw something!

26:50.742 --> 26:52.232
Gun. It's loaded.

26:52.544 --> 26:55.012
- Back up, I said!
- Listen! He's telling the truth!

26:55.180 --> 26:56.875
- Listen!
- Shut up! Just shut up!

26:57.582 --> 26:59.243
My badge is here.

26:59.417 --> 27:01.408
- Listen. We have to go.
- He has a badge.

27:02.354 --> 27:04.515
Calm down! You on duty?

27:04.689 --> 27:06.884
I work for the mayor.

27:07.525 --> 27:09.356
Listen to me! We are in danger!

27:09.527 --> 27:11.927
We gotta get out of here!
We have to go!

27:12.931 --> 27:16.765
Why'd you run for the president?
Why did you run for the president?

27:16.935 --> 27:19.836
I hear bang. I go to protect the mayor.
It's my job.

27:20.005 --> 27:21.996
- You got there pretty fast.
- He's a cop.

27:22.173 --> 27:24.733
- I don't care, he knows something!
- Get him out of here!

27:24.909 --> 27:28.003
I've been set up!
You got the wrong person!

27:28.446 --> 27:30.243
Do not release him!

27:49.434 --> 27:51.994
Medic! We need a medic here!

27:55.306 --> 27:56.898
Holden.

28:03.515 --> 28:05.642
Hey! Stop him! Stop!

28:06.685 --> 28:08.653
Hey! Stop him!

28:09.254 --> 28:10.278
Hey, freeze!

28:10.889 --> 28:12.550
Out of the way! Out of the way!

28:12.724 --> 28:15.557
Freeze! Stop! I said freeze!

28:15.727 --> 28:16.819
Damn it!

28:21.833 --> 28:23.494
Get out the way! Get out the way!

28:24.803 --> 28:28.068
Stop him! Stop him!
Someone stop him!

28:37.348 --> 28:39.475
<i>I'll be at the underpass.</i>

28:46.324 --> 28:47.655
Stop!

28:48.326 --> 28:49.987
Get down! Get down!

28:52.363 --> 28:53.523
Move!

28:55.033 --> 28:56.295
Let's go!

29:03.141 --> 29:04.199
Move! Move!

29:16.087 --> 29:18.021
Out the way. Out the way!

29:18.957 --> 29:21.118
Get out of the way! Police!

29:22.994 --> 29:24.518
Out of the way!

29:32.871 --> 29:34.236
Shit.

29:36.841 --> 29:37.865
Out the way!

30:21.486 --> 30:23.317
Surprised to see me alive?

30:58.122 --> 30:59.612
It's amazing.

31:02.927 --> 31:04.724
Hello.

31:05.730 --> 31:07.789
- Hello, how are you?
- Okay.

31:09.567 --> 31:10.795
Excuse me.

31:55.647 --> 31:57.512
What are you seeing?

31:58.917 --> 32:00.475
- Speak English.
- I try.

32:00.652 --> 32:03.052
I'm just watching
all the people up there.

32:03.454 --> 32:06.082
Hi. My name is Sam.
Nice to meet you.

32:06.257 --> 32:07.849
Howard Lewis.
Nice to meet you too.

32:08.026 --> 32:10.017
- American?
- Yeah.

32:11.229 --> 32:14.824
- What brings you here?
- Just looking for a little excitement.

32:14.999 --> 32:17.490
- First time, huh?
- Europe? Yeah.

32:17.669 --> 32:20.536
Yeah, it just felt like it was
the right time. What about you?

32:21.072 --> 32:22.801
I go where the moment takes me.

32:23.308 --> 32:25.401
That must be nice. No family, right?

32:25.576 --> 32:26.907
No.

32:27.412 --> 32:28.743
None that I know of.

32:28.913 --> 32:31.404
Things change when
you got kids running around.

32:31.582 --> 32:33.243
Are yours with you?

32:33.751 --> 32:37.448
No, they're with their mother. We're
going through a bad patch right now.

32:38.056 --> 32:40.854
I needed to get away for
a little while, give us some space.

32:45.430 --> 32:47.921
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- It's fine, it's fine.

32:48.299 --> 32:49.630
I think it's my cue.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.325
Yeah. It's nice to meet you.

32:51.502 --> 32:53.197
Nice to meet you too. Best of luck.

32:53.371 --> 32:54.804
Yeah. To you too.

32:59.677 --> 33:01.372
What's your name?

33:03.548 --> 33:06.108
- Hey, tell him your name.
- Anna.

33:06.284 --> 33:07.444
That's a pretty name.

33:07.618 --> 33:10.178
You look about the same age
as my son, Nathan.

33:11.055 --> 33:12.488
Can I buy her another cone?

33:12.690 --> 33:15.682
- No, no, no, it's okay. Thank you.
- No, really, really.

33:15.860 --> 33:16.986
No, no, it's okay.

33:17.161 --> 33:19.152
- Please, Mom?
- That's enough, I said no.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.299
Anna?

33:22.633 --> 33:24.066
I'm sorry.

33:32.543 --> 33:36.479
Ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the United States:

33:36.781 --> 33:39.215
President Henry Ashton.

33:55.066 --> 33:58.695
Welcome. Thank you so much
for being here.

33:59.137 --> 34:01.867
This is a wondrous day.

34:02.507 --> 34:04.566
Today we make history.

34:08.579 --> 34:13.539
It is with great pleasure that
I invite you all to our humble city.

34:13.818 --> 34:17.049
The hopes of the world are with us.

34:18.022 --> 34:19.649
We must come together...

34:20.425 --> 34:22.120
...on this day...

34:22.560 --> 34:25.222
...in this renowned place...

34:25.396 --> 34:27.193
...to band together for peace.

34:27.364 --> 34:30.300
I don't think he's supposed to be
up there. What's he doing?

34:30.467 --> 34:35.599
Therefore, I offer you my city,
my heart and my hope.

34:36.741 --> 34:38.368
What's he doing up there?

34:56.427 --> 34:57.724
Get him!

34:57.895 --> 34:59.522
Eagle's down, Eagle's down!

34:59.697 --> 35:02.825
We got a GSW. Repeat, GSW.
We gotta leave right now.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.934
Get him out of here!
Get him out of here!

35:05.103 --> 35:07.162
Let's go! Move him!
Go! Go, go, go!

35:07.338 --> 35:09.397
- One, two, three.
- You got him?

35:09.574 --> 35:10.768
- Let me go!
- Move!

35:11.476 --> 35:12.500
Shut up! Move it!

35:13.411 --> 35:16.403
- Let me go!
- What were you doing up there?

35:16.714 --> 35:18.705
Hey! Answer the goddamn question.

35:18.883 --> 35:20.316
Veronica!

35:20.485 --> 35:21.577
Veronica!

35:21.752 --> 35:23.151
We have to go!

35:23.321 --> 35:27.280
Please! Listen to me!
We have to go!

35:27.458 --> 35:28.482
Hey. Step away, sir.

35:28.659 --> 35:30.854
- She threw something.
- Gun. It's loaded.

35:31.028 --> 35:34.429
- Hey! Back up, sir!
- Listen to me! He's telling the truth.

35:34.599 --> 35:36.499
Veronica. Veronica!

35:44.976 --> 35:47.410
Anna! Anna!

36:00.758 --> 36:02.123
<i>Hi, leave a message.</i>

36:02.293 --> 36:04.921
Pam. It's me.

36:06.097 --> 36:08.531
Probably waking you up, it's just...

36:08.699 --> 36:12.499
You'll see on the news when you
wake up that the president's been shot.

36:13.004 --> 36:17.600
He was here in Spain, and I think
I just saw the guy who did it.

36:17.775 --> 36:20.835
Look, look. I'm all right, all right?

36:21.012 --> 36:24.743
I just want you to let the kids know
that I'm fine...

36:24.916 --> 36:26.713
...and that I love them
very much and...

36:27.652 --> 36:29.847
Oh, man. I can't believe
what I just saw.

36:30.021 --> 36:31.682
And I think I got it all on tape.

36:31.856 --> 36:33.915
I don't know what to do,
but the right...

36:34.091 --> 36:35.388
Sir, we need your camera.

36:36.394 --> 36:37.827
- Sure.
- Where's the zoom?

36:38.296 --> 36:39.729
Press this button right there.

36:39.897 --> 36:43.196
Yeah. That's...
That's where the flutter was.

36:43.367 --> 36:46.336
But the shot was up to the left.

36:46.504 --> 36:49.871
- You saw the shooter?
- I saw something, like a flash of light.

36:50.041 --> 36:52.874
Right there. There was something
in that window right there.

36:53.044 --> 36:55.706
- I saw a man in that room, sir.
- I'll go check it out.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.848
- I'm coming with you.
- No! No.

36:58.015 --> 36:59.983
If you're wrong, let me take the heat.

37:01.385 --> 37:04.445
- Sir, did you film this entire thing?
- Yes, I did.

37:04.622 --> 37:05.646
Show me.

37:11.095 --> 37:13.029
I think I got the shooter on tape.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.633
Wait, go forward.

37:21.239 --> 37:24.675
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
There's a bomb at the podium!

38:07.652 --> 38:10.849
Medic! We need a medic here!

38:25.436 --> 38:26.494
Anna?

38:28.072 --> 38:29.164
Anna!

38:30.875 --> 38:32.968
Where's your mother?
Where is she?

38:33.144 --> 38:36.636
Everybody evacuate
the plaza, okay?

38:37.081 --> 38:39.106
- Come with me.
- Okay.

38:39.283 --> 38:42.150
I gotta get you somewhere safe,
then we'll find your mother.

38:52.496 --> 38:54.123
Someone stop him!

38:54.832 --> 38:56.197
Hold it!

38:58.602 --> 39:00.229
Are you okay?

39:00.438 --> 39:02.303
Hey! Hey! Get out the way!

39:03.507 --> 39:05.304
Stop him! Get out the way!

39:06.711 --> 39:07.871
Stop him!

39:08.045 --> 39:11.139
Anyone, stop him!
Help us! Someone help!

39:18.122 --> 39:21.250
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I need your help.

39:21.425 --> 39:25.361
I need you to watch her. Her mother's
gone, I don't know where she is.

39:25.529 --> 39:26.860
She'll be safe with me.

39:27.031 --> 39:30.330
I'm gonna be right back.
I'm gonna be right back.

39:31.469 --> 39:33.061
I've got to help the police.

39:33.237 --> 39:35.865
Just stay with this lady
and I'll be back. I promise.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.905
I'll be right back, okay?

39:38.075 --> 39:39.440
I'll be right back.

39:39.610 --> 39:42.170
Don't worry, we'll find your mom,
don't cry.

39:55.126 --> 39:56.991
Stop! Get out the way.

40:27.992 --> 40:29.983
Hold it! Stop!

40:30.694 --> 40:32.423
Stop! Freeze!

40:37.435 --> 40:40.370
Out of the way! Freeze!
Stop him!

40:40.538 --> 40:42.699
Move! Move, move, move!

40:48.979 --> 40:50.947
Move! Quick!

40:52.216 --> 40:54.207
Turn left, I got right!

40:54.552 --> 40:56.019
Move!

41:49.540 --> 41:51.064
He's a cop.

41:52.076 --> 41:53.373
He's a cop.

42:01.118 --> 42:02.517
Freeze!

42:06.724 --> 42:09.215
He shot him. He shot him.

42:19.069 --> 42:21.128
Anna. Anna.

42:28.112 --> 42:29.136
Anna!

42:37.388 --> 42:38.719
Anna!

43:07.351 --> 43:09.478
When do we think
the changes will be ready?

43:09.653 --> 43:11.814
It's not like I have to make
a speech now.

43:12.289 --> 43:16.157
I could just wing it. How much trouble
could I really get myself into?

43:19.964 --> 43:22.296
Thanks. Nice to know
we both know my limitations.

43:25.936 --> 43:27.927
- We're stopping?
- Yes, sir.

43:35.546 --> 43:37.707
Rick, I'll call you back.

43:42.186 --> 43:43.915
The NSA's just confirmed the threat.

43:44.521 --> 43:47.251
- <i>Control, handoff complete.</i>
- <i>Roger, point man.</i>

43:52.196 --> 43:53.220
Where's Phil?

43:53.397 --> 43:55.991
The hotel.
He's on with the Joint Chiefs.

43:56.967 --> 43:59.435
He's sending the double, isn't he?

43:59.637 --> 44:01.104
Yeah.

44:01.405 --> 44:02.997
We're moving POTUS to the hotel.

44:03.674 --> 44:06.905
Control, we've N.D.'d the car.
POTUS is returning.

44:07.144 --> 44:10.443
We issue a statement that we're
deferring to Prime Minister Gutierrez...

44:10.614 --> 44:11.979
Deferring, that's great.

44:12.149 --> 44:14.879
<i>Control, E TA to castle</i>
<i>is two minutes.</i>

44:15.052 --> 44:17.384
Today of all days.

44:17.921 --> 44:19.013
Christ.

44:19.189 --> 44:21.589
Sir, we've used doubles
since Reagan.

44:24.328 --> 44:27.491
That was for photo ops.
Not for anything this big.

44:30.167 --> 44:32.727
<i>Control, we have POTUS</i>
<i>and we are moving to the castle.</i>

44:39.376 --> 44:41.367
<i>Eagle has arrived at the plaza.</i>

44:49.486 --> 44:52.319
<i>Control, we have POTUS</i>
<i>and are entering the castle.</i>

45:04.401 --> 45:06.164
- Sir.
- Talk to me, Phil.

45:06.336 --> 45:08.327
NSA called it five minutes ago.
It's real.

45:08.505 --> 45:11.668
And the summit? You're not
thinking of pulling out entirely?

45:11.842 --> 45:12.934
Why would we?

45:14.878 --> 45:16.243
Do we know who's behind this?

45:16.413 --> 45:19.473
A local group with a vague connection
to the Mujahedin Brigade.

45:19.650 --> 45:21.914
- Why issue the threat now?
- U.S. Special Forces...

45:22.086 --> 45:24.748
...uncovered a plot to smuggle
a bomb out of Morocco.

45:24.922 --> 45:28.449
We took their bomb and their men,
and this may be their retaliation.

45:28.792 --> 45:31.158
You think trying to kill me
is a retaliation.

45:40.537 --> 45:42.004
POTUS is moving.

45:43.107 --> 45:44.904
<i>Safe for Eagle to exit vehicle.</i>

45:45.075 --> 45:46.201
<i>Copy that.</i>

46:01.225 --> 46:02.487
This is them?

46:02.659 --> 46:06.493
That's Benwar Suarez. As near
as we can tell, he leads the group.

46:07.397 --> 46:08.887
And what do we know about him?

46:09.066 --> 46:11.398
He's from Morocco,
educated in Paris.

46:11.568 --> 46:14.867
He went off the map for awhile,
but he surfaced in Beirut, Darfur.

46:15.239 --> 46:18.538
Couple days ago we intercepted an
e-mail between members of his group.

46:18.709 --> 46:21.701
Embedded in it were links to maps,
blueprints of the area.

46:21.879 --> 46:24.074
It was this morning
that we received the threat.

46:24.248 --> 46:26.307
The Joint Chiefs,
what do they recommend?

46:26.483 --> 46:28.781
That we go after their leadership.

46:28.952 --> 46:30.385
Here in Spain?

46:32.556 --> 46:33.580
Morocco.

46:35.259 --> 46:37.784
We have a satellite lock
on one of their camps there.

46:38.929 --> 46:42.558
You want me to call in a strike
on a friendly Arab nation?

46:42.733 --> 46:44.064
They're harboring terrorists.

46:51.842 --> 46:54.572
- And this intel, we're certain...?
- Absolutely.

46:55.078 --> 46:56.545
Control, we're clear on seven.

46:56.713 --> 46:59.580
Why not focus on the ones
who are here actually doing this?

46:59.750 --> 47:01.081
This summit is too important.

47:01.251 --> 47:04.414
But we're looking for five people
out of 6 million. We are trying.

47:04.588 --> 47:05.680
Try harder.

47:12.095 --> 47:16.725
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the president of the United States:</i>

47:16.900 --> 47:19.232
<i>President Henry Ashton.</i>

47:22.172 --> 47:24.970
A wonderful day. Some words now.

47:30.514 --> 47:31.538
Welcome.

47:31.782 --> 47:34.751
<i>This is a wondrous day.</i>

47:35.619 --> 47:37.610
<i>Today, we make history.</i>

47:40.891 --> 47:43.257
- He doesn't even look like me.
- <i>Señor Presidente...</i>

47:43.961 --> 47:46.953
<i>... fellow members</i>
<i>of the European Union...</i>

47:47.130 --> 47:48.461
<i>... President Ashton...</i>

47:48.632 --> 47:50.896
<i>... and citizens of the world...</i>

47:51.068 --> 47:56.062
<i>... it is with great pleasure that</i>
<i>I invite you all to our humble city.</i>

47:57.207 --> 47:58.640
Is that Thomas?

47:58.809 --> 47:59.901
Yes, sir.

48:00.777 --> 48:02.745
I thought he was still inactive.

48:02.913 --> 48:04.244
He was.

48:05.749 --> 48:07.808
Well, if he's back,
why isn't he with me?

48:10.087 --> 48:11.577
We weren't sure if he was ready.

48:14.791 --> 48:17.885
- You sent him out there.
- We need someone to sell the double.

48:18.061 --> 48:21.258
Sell? He took a bullet for me, Phil.

48:21.431 --> 48:23.058
And look at him.

48:26.637 --> 48:28.662
He hasn't stopped
punishing himself since.

48:28.839 --> 48:30.830
I liked him every bit
as much as you did.

48:31.008 --> 48:33.442
But we needed to know
we could count on him again.

48:33.610 --> 48:36.135
So you threw him out there
to see if he could?

48:36.747 --> 48:39.147
That's how we treat
our friends now?

48:40.684 --> 48:41.708
<i>Therefore...</i>

48:42.152 --> 48:46.953
<i>... I offer you my city,</i>
<i>my heart and my hope.</i>

48:48.392 --> 48:51.295
<i>This summit could very well be the</i>
<i>defining moment of his presidency.</i>

48:56.099 --> 48:57.123
Jesus!

48:57.768 --> 48:59.793
<i>The president appears</i>
<i>to have been shot.</i>

49:00.170 --> 49:04.038
<i>I heard two shots,</i>
<i>and the president fell.</i>

49:04.508 --> 49:06.339
Get the Joint Chiefs on the line now.

49:07.511 --> 49:10.412
Admiral Houston, it's McCullough.
Have you seen the situation?

49:10.580 --> 49:11.877
The president is secure.

49:12.049 --> 49:13.209
<i>Get him out of here!</i>

49:13.650 --> 49:16.483
How long do we have to get
the birds in the air?

49:16.720 --> 49:18.153
So you're ready to strike now?

49:21.024 --> 49:22.616
Mr. President.

49:22.793 --> 49:24.192
Sir.

49:25.429 --> 49:26.453
Mr. President.

49:26.930 --> 49:30.058
The Chiefs have a satellite lock
on their village. They're ready.

49:31.435 --> 49:32.527
Sir?

49:33.704 --> 49:34.728
Ted?

49:35.172 --> 49:38.073
- There's an issue of when we can go.
- We go now.

49:38.241 --> 49:41.074
You can't give the order.
You've been shot.

49:42.346 --> 49:45.110
We go now, we risk telling the world
that you weren't there.

49:45.282 --> 49:46.772
We weren't there, Ted.

49:47.451 --> 49:48.918
Get the vice president to do it.

49:49.086 --> 49:51.953
No, we are not going near
the 25th Amendment.

49:53.790 --> 49:57.783
Tell Rick to work up a story
I was shot, but I'm okay.

49:57.961 --> 49:59.019
That's not gonna fly.

49:59.196 --> 50:02.256
If we have to go to some hospital
and put on a show, we do it.

50:02.432 --> 50:04.127
- We have to talk...
- I'm done talking!

50:05.602 --> 50:07.160
Christ!

50:10.073 --> 50:12.598
Sir, we gotta go now.
We have to attack.

50:12.776 --> 50:13.834
Sir?

50:16.513 --> 50:18.504
Cavic, find out what's
going on down there.

50:19.449 --> 50:22.213
Mr. President, please step away
from the glass.

50:24.921 --> 50:27.082
- Cavic to Control.
- Mr. President.

50:31.261 --> 50:32.523
Tell them to stand down.

50:32.696 --> 50:34.129
Sir, we have to respond!

50:34.297 --> 50:37.357
Bombing a camp in Morocco will
blow this summit out of the water.

50:37.534 --> 50:40.094
That is what the people
behind this want me to do.

50:40.270 --> 50:42.397
Mr. President,
we have to act strong.

50:42.572 --> 50:44.699
No, we have to be strong.

50:44.875 --> 50:47.435
They sent us a warning
because they want us to react.

50:47.611 --> 50:48.771
They know our playbook.

50:49.046 --> 50:52.209
They're banking on us doing
what we always do. We will hit back.

50:52.382 --> 50:54.907
We have the world's sympathy
right now.

50:55.952 --> 50:59.115
Let's honor that. Let's finish
what we came here to do.

50:59.289 --> 51:00.984
Okay, copy that.

51:01.158 --> 51:03.752
Everything is being prepared
to transport the president.

51:03.927 --> 51:06.395
We need to get the president
to Air Force One now.

51:06.563 --> 51:09.259
I'm done hiding.
This is the president, is my wife there?

51:09.499 --> 51:12.764
- We have to be better than this.
- Sir.

51:13.103 --> 51:16.266
- Yeah, get Air Force One ready...
- Kay, it's me.

51:17.474 --> 51:19.465
No, we're fine here. We're safe.

51:56.880 --> 52:01.146
<i>Good morning, America. It's now</i>
<i>12 noon in Salamanca, Spain.</i>

52:01.318 --> 52:04.412
<i>In a short time, world leaders</i>
<i>from over 150 countries...</i>

52:04.588 --> 52:06.647
<i>... meet here in Plaza Mayor...</i>

52:06.890 --> 52:08.050
You like it?

52:10.026 --> 52:12.256
Thank you.
All right, then. Let's eat and walk?

52:14.764 --> 52:17.289
<i>Security services are on high alert</i>
<i>here in Salamanca.</i>

52:17.467 --> 52:21.460
<i>We go live to our news team on the</i>
<i>ground and our reporter Angie Jones.</i>

52:21.638 --> 52:25.938
<i>I am standing inside Plaza Mayor</i>
<i>in Salamanca, Spain.</i>

52:30.714 --> 52:32.682
I thought you'd want it for luck.

52:37.821 --> 52:39.482
I want to know he's okay.

52:46.563 --> 52:48.428
This was taken 15 minutes ago.

52:48.598 --> 52:51.499
You would find that we are
taking good care of your brother...

52:53.069 --> 52:54.661
What have you done to him?

52:54.838 --> 52:56.965
He's still in one piece.

52:57.140 --> 52:58.732
You should be happy about that.

53:00.777 --> 53:03.712
Do what you're supposed to do
and your brother will be fine.

53:03.880 --> 53:07.782
If you fail, then this would be the last
thing you have to remember him by...

53:12.255 --> 53:14.223
You look out for yourself.

53:16.793 --> 53:18.556
I'll be at the underpass.

53:41.184 --> 53:44.620
Luis, stick with the protestors.
We never see this side of the story.

53:44.788 --> 53:46.153
<i>Are you gonna move or what?</i>

53:46.323 --> 53:49.622
I've got her lecturing me now.

53:50.093 --> 53:53.119
We're here for the conference
not the sideshow.

53:55.165 --> 53:57.395
Is everything going to plan?

53:58.134 --> 53:59.897
To the last detail.

54:00.070 --> 54:01.128
<i>And the president?</i>

54:01.805 --> 54:03.363
Are you sure they sent a double?

54:03.807 --> 54:05.502
The beauty of American arrogance...

54:05.675 --> 54:09.941
...is that they cannot imagine a world
where they're not a step ahead.

54:14.284 --> 54:16.445
<i>Has the package arrived?</i>

54:18.455 --> 54:20.821
- As we speak.
- <i>Perfect.</i>

54:20.991 --> 54:22.185
<i>Javier will be by.</i>

54:22.359 --> 54:23.587
Understood.

54:23.760 --> 54:24.954
<i>Felipe.</i>

54:26.096 --> 54:28.155
You will make us very proud.

54:37.040 --> 54:39.702
<i>Control, we have POTUS</i>
<i>and are entering the castle.</i>

54:39.943 --> 54:42.275
<i>Copy that.</i>
<i>Eagle has arrived at the plaza.</i>

54:44.447 --> 54:45.846
- <i>Javier.</i>
- Yeah.

54:46.283 --> 54:47.341
Are you in position?

54:47.550 --> 54:49.313
- I'm on my way.
- <i>Good.</i>

54:49.486 --> 54:53.286
For the moment, the Americans think
they've dodged a bullet. Do not be late.

54:53.456 --> 54:56.016
- Don't worry about me.
- <i>I won't.</i>

54:56.359 --> 54:59.351
Your brother spoke very highly
of your Special Forces training.

55:00.730 --> 55:02.561
<i>Do not disappoint him.</i>

55:06.736 --> 55:10.001
You just make sure my brother
will be at the underpass.

55:15.045 --> 55:16.842
How's our boy doing?

55:19.582 --> 55:20.913
Are we go?

55:36.166 --> 55:37.599
Good day.

55:42.672 --> 55:44.139
Good day, sir.

55:50.180 --> 55:52.478
Control, we have an active
crossing the lobby.

55:56.820 --> 55:59.789
- Honey, I'm coming up to the room.
- He's clear. Area secure.

56:43.933 --> 56:44.991
What are you seeing?

57:12.195 --> 57:14.254
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- It's fine, it's fine.

57:23.573 --> 57:25.040
I think it's my cue.

57:25.208 --> 57:26.698
Yeah. It's nice to meet you.

57:26.876 --> 57:29.538
- Best of luck.
- All right. To you too.

57:37.086 --> 57:39.350
Señor Presidente...

57:39.522 --> 57:42.389
...fellow members
of the European Union...

57:42.992 --> 57:45.654
...our friends from Africa,
Middle East...

57:45.829 --> 57:47.296
Let's make ourselves a shooter.

57:47.464 --> 57:50.365
...President Ashton,
citizens of the world...

57:51.201 --> 57:55.433
...it is with great pleasure
that I invite you all to our humble city.

57:57.240 --> 58:00.835
And it is with a sad heart...

58:01.010 --> 58:02.944
...that we must meet in mourning...

58:03.112 --> 58:07.412
...for those who lost loved ones
in the recent bombings.

58:07.784 --> 58:12.244
- That should keep him occupied.
- Today, we stand together...

58:12.956 --> 58:17.290
...and what we achieve here
will be remembered forever.

58:29.906 --> 58:32.500
- <i>Crowd detail, hostile check.</i>
- <i>All clear from above.</i>

58:37.146 --> 58:40.206
- <i>Javier. Are you good to go?</i>
- This is Control. Keep us updated.

58:42.418 --> 58:46.252
We must come together
on this day...

58:46.422 --> 58:48.583
...in this renowned place...

58:49.425 --> 58:53.225
...to band together for peace.

58:53.663 --> 58:54.687
Therefore...

58:55.164 --> 58:59.328
...I offer you my city, my heart
and my hope.

59:15.885 --> 59:17.477
We gotta get Eagle out now.

59:17.954 --> 59:19.888
Eagle's down! Eagle's down!

59:20.123 --> 59:23.524
<i>We got a GSW!</i>
<i>Let's go, move it! Move it!</i>

59:30.366 --> 59:32.732
- <i>control of the building</i>
<i>along the back...</i>

59:35.438 --> 59:37.770
- Control room cleared.
- Do you have the frequency?

59:37.941 --> 59:39.966
Four, one, nine, one, zero.

59:42.812 --> 59:44.507
<i>No one goes in or out</i>
<i>without our go.</i>

59:44.881 --> 59:48.112
<i>Control. Come in, Control.</i>
<i>I need a 20 on POTUS.</i>

59:48.284 --> 59:50.081
Control. Come in, Control.

59:51.254 --> 59:53.381
- Move it! Go!
- Control!

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:23.984
Take care of him.

01:00:43.673 --> 01:00:44.867
Let's go.

01:01:08.431 --> 01:01:10.058
Control?

01:01:10.266 --> 01:01:12.097
Come in, Control.

01:01:13.403 --> 01:01:15.303
Control, are you there?

01:01:26.115 --> 01:01:30.074
This is Control. We have agents down.
I repeat, agents down.

01:01:30.253 --> 01:01:33.552
We have a situation at the front
requiring immediate backup.

01:01:33.723 --> 01:01:35.247
Copy, Control.

01:01:40.863 --> 01:01:43.730
Coming to the lobby to assist.
ETA, 30 seconds.

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:45.800
Come on, guys. Move, move, move!

01:01:55.978 --> 01:01:57.809
<i>What's the status on level seven?</i>

01:01:57.980 --> 01:01:59.845
Blue team's clear on seven.

01:02:28.244 --> 01:02:31.475
Get Air Force One ready and send
a chopper. We can get out of here.

01:02:31.647 --> 01:02:33.877
No, we're fine. We're safe.

01:02:45.862 --> 01:02:48.524
Get up! Get up!

01:02:53.069 --> 01:02:55.697
<i>Multiple casualties.</i>
<i>Repeat, multiple casualties.</i>

01:03:05.548 --> 01:03:06.879
Hey.

01:03:07.416 --> 01:03:10.613
We need your help. Now.

01:03:13.055 --> 01:03:16.115
Come on. He's over here.
We've done everything we can.

01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:18.117
He's got no pulse.

01:03:22.265 --> 01:03:23.357
Secret Service.

01:03:23.533 --> 01:03:25.797
- I need to see your tapes.
- Yeah.

01:03:26.102 --> 01:03:28.696
I need to see any footage
of the back of the plaza.

01:03:28.871 --> 01:03:30.839
We need footage
of the back of the plaza.

01:03:31.874 --> 01:03:32.898
Again.

01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:35.975
Two. Again.

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:43.877
- Washington, this is Agent Barnes.
- <i>Go ahead.</i>

01:03:44.053 --> 01:03:46.681
Control is down. My partner
is in pursuit of a suspect.

01:03:46.856 --> 01:03:49.324
We need immediate assistance
outside the back annex.

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:51.426
- <i>Give me a heading.</i>
- They have a suspect.

01:03:51.594 --> 01:03:53.653
Headed west on surface streets.
Do you copy?

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:54.888
<i>West, copy that.</i>

01:03:55.198 --> 01:03:58.690
Camera six, if you can hear me,
turn around and go west.

01:03:59.035 --> 01:04:00.559
Backup is on its...

01:04:00.736 --> 01:04:02.829
<i>What? Barnes, what is it?</i>

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:04.697
<i>Barnes.</i>

01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:09.600
Oh, my God.

01:04:13.115 --> 01:04:14.412
- I'm coming with you.
- No.

01:04:14.584 --> 01:04:16.449
If you're wrong, let me take the heat.

01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:44.239
- Barnes, you were right.
- <i>About what?</i>

01:04:44.413 --> 01:04:48.213
About the shooter. I'm in pursuit,
leaving the back annex, heading west.

01:04:51.187 --> 01:04:52.211
What?

01:04:53.155 --> 01:04:54.213
<i>Barnes, what is it?</i>

01:04:55.558 --> 01:04:56.582
<i>Barnes.</i>

01:05:26.989 --> 01:05:28.422
Hey!

01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:33.828
Secret Service, get out of the car.
Get... Get out of the car.

01:05:38.434 --> 01:05:40.095
- <i>Washington.</i>
- This is Barnes.

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:44.365
Look, I know how this is gonna sound,
but Agent Taylor has gone rogue.

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:46.132
Call the other agents back.

01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:49.301
I know I made the call,
but there's something else going on.

01:05:51.047 --> 01:05:53.140
- <i>Barnes.</i>
- Control is compromised.

01:05:53.316 --> 01:05:55.841
- <i>All agents are heading west.</i>
- Listen to me! Damn it!

01:05:57.053 --> 01:05:58.213
Goddamn it!

01:06:22.878 --> 01:06:24.277
Let him go.

01:06:24.914 --> 01:06:26.347
What are you talking about?

01:06:26.515 --> 01:06:31.384
My brother. I've done my part.
Now you let him go.

01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:33.049
Put the gun down.

01:06:33.222 --> 01:06:38.558
Make the call. Or I pull the trigger,
and your plan's finished.

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:42.354
Again.

01:06:43.199 --> 01:06:44.325
Again.

01:06:45.501 --> 01:06:47.093
Go ahead.

01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:49.594
Do it.

01:06:51.974 --> 01:06:54.033
Do it and your brother is dead.

01:06:54.210 --> 01:06:59.011
Can you live with that? Knowing that
your brother died because of you?

01:07:00.182 --> 01:07:02.047
Javier, listen to me.

01:07:02.718 --> 01:07:05.653
He's going to be delivered
at the underpass.

01:07:06.122 --> 01:07:07.646
Don't mess it up now.

01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:11.421
You'll get your brother back.

01:07:19.201 --> 01:07:20.225
Nothing...

01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:26.907
Nothing had better happen to him.

01:07:29.812 --> 01:07:31.336
Nothing will.

01:07:41.957 --> 01:07:43.447
Shit.

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.252
<i>Washington.</i>

01:07:45.428 --> 01:07:49.091
This is Barnes. I've lost Agent Taylor.
I need a GPS location on his cellular.

01:07:49.265 --> 01:07:50.596
<i>Copy that.</i>

01:07:58.808 --> 01:08:01.470
Hold him. Hold him.
Thank you, he's gonna be all right.

01:08:01.644 --> 01:08:03.134
Veronica.

01:08:22.564 --> 01:08:24.089
I'm here.

01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:33.801
We did it.

01:08:34.643 --> 01:08:35.769
Not yet.

01:08:45.587 --> 01:08:48.148
- Yeah.
- <i>Barnes, POTUS has been abducted.</i>

01:08:48.323 --> 01:08:51.452
<i>Present location unknown.</i>
<i>No signal from Taylor's phone.</i>

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:54.562
<i>It's imperative we locate</i>
<i>and apprehend Taylor.</i>

01:08:55.197 --> 01:08:56.288
Son of a bitch.

01:09:19.417 --> 01:09:20.782
He fell down.

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:22.782
Leave him.

01:09:25.823 --> 01:09:26.848
It's me.

01:09:27.893 --> 01:09:28.984
<i>They bought it.</i>

01:09:29.161 --> 01:09:30.321
What about Barnes?

01:09:30.761 --> 01:09:33.322
He took the bait.
He's pissing in the wind.

01:09:34.032 --> 01:09:36.933
He's created a manhunt
for a shooter that doesn't exist.

01:09:37.435 --> 01:09:39.562
<i>Have you got Javier?</i>
<i>We may need him later.</i>

01:09:39.738 --> 01:09:41.205
I'm on my way.

01:09:53.818 --> 01:09:56.343
I thought he was
supposed to be dead.

01:09:58.890 --> 01:10:00.949
We need to tie up
all of the loose ends.

01:10:02.494 --> 01:10:03.688
Who's a loose end?

01:10:05.230 --> 01:10:06.254
You are.

01:10:29.821 --> 01:10:31.550
Give me the keys!

01:10:42.334 --> 01:10:43.426
You're late.

01:10:56.748 --> 01:10:58.579
Let's go, let's go!

01:10:58.750 --> 01:10:59.978
Relax.

01:11:00.151 --> 01:11:01.209
We've pulled it off.

01:11:15.233 --> 01:11:17.258
This is Agent Barnes.
I've located Taylor.

01:11:17.435 --> 01:11:22.463
He's driving a Salamanca police
vehicle, registration Sierra-073654.

01:11:22.641 --> 01:11:26.133
At present heading south,
repeat, south, on Calle de San Pablo.

01:11:30.115 --> 01:11:32.345
That looks bad.

01:11:34.653 --> 01:11:37.850
We've waited too long for this.

01:11:38.023 --> 01:11:40.389
Thank God this double life
is almost over.

01:11:40.558 --> 01:11:42.116
Just get me to my brother.

01:11:56.608 --> 01:11:58.371
Christ. It's Barnes.

01:12:13.725 --> 01:12:14.817
Got company.

01:12:16.328 --> 01:12:17.352
It's Barnes.

01:12:18.096 --> 01:12:19.154
Can you lose him?

01:12:19.331 --> 01:12:20.764
I'm working on it.

01:12:36.181 --> 01:12:37.842
Come on, come on, come on!

01:12:38.016 --> 01:12:39.313
Just relax.

01:13:04.809 --> 01:13:07.107
Oh, shit. Shit, shit!

01:13:35.173 --> 01:13:36.333
Shit.

01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:49.910
Shit!

01:13:53.324 --> 01:13:54.916
<i>Have you lost him?</i>

01:13:55.093 --> 01:13:56.617
I'm still working on it.

01:13:56.795 --> 01:14:00.060
Well, until you do, stay clear
of the rendezvous. All right?

01:14:01.166 --> 01:14:03.066
No. We're going to
the underpass now.

01:14:03.234 --> 01:14:06.226
- You heard what he said.
- I'm picking up my brother.

01:14:06.404 --> 01:14:08.929
Are you out of your mind?
I've worked too hard.

01:14:09.107 --> 01:14:13.009
Either you're coming with,
or I drive myself. You choose.

01:14:14.345 --> 01:14:15.505
Shit!

01:14:21.085 --> 01:14:22.109
Oh, shit!

01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:31.322
Shit! Get him off my ass.

01:15:07.532 --> 01:15:09.124
Look out!

01:15:11.369 --> 01:15:12.859
Happy?

01:15:13.705 --> 01:15:14.899
Just drive.

01:15:28.353 --> 01:15:30.014
Where's my brother?

01:15:30.188 --> 01:15:31.587
Surprised to see me alive?

01:15:31.890 --> 01:15:33.653
- Where's Veronica?
- Veronica said...

01:15:33.825 --> 01:15:35.850
I don't care. You both tried to kill...

01:15:41.466 --> 01:15:43.957
- Where's my brother?
- What brother?

01:15:45.737 --> 01:15:47.261
Where's my brother?

01:15:47.438 --> 01:15:49.770
Looks like we've both been set up.

01:15:58.449 --> 01:15:59.780
Anna. Anna.

01:16:00.585 --> 01:16:01.882
Come on, let's go!

01:16:02.654 --> 01:16:04.315
Where is he?

01:16:04.822 --> 01:16:06.312
Where is he?

01:16:15.967 --> 01:16:17.764
Back off.

01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:24.270
Let's go, let's go! Come on!

01:16:24.442 --> 01:16:28.242
I won't ask you again.
Where's my brother?

01:16:29.247 --> 01:16:30.475
Go to hell.

01:16:38.690 --> 01:16:40.248
Freeze!

01:16:50.835 --> 01:16:52.928
Give me my brother!

01:16:53.304 --> 01:16:54.328
He's dead.

01:17:41.419 --> 01:17:42.545
Goddamn you!

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:44.381
You used me.

01:17:45.089 --> 01:17:47.182
I trusted you, you son of a bitch.

01:17:49.694 --> 01:17:51.321
Who's got POTUS?

01:17:52.230 --> 01:17:53.788
You're too late, Tom.

01:17:53.965 --> 01:17:55.694
Why the fuck did you do this?

01:17:55.867 --> 01:17:57.391
You can't stop us.

01:17:57.802 --> 01:17:59.030
You'll never stop it.

01:17:59.971 --> 01:18:04.135
This war will never end.

01:18:06.477 --> 01:18:08.035
Kent.

01:18:08.646 --> 01:18:12.047
Kent. Kent, what have you done?

01:18:13.418 --> 01:18:16.353
Kent, who's got the president?

01:18:16.587 --> 01:18:18.145
Kent!

01:18:30.702 --> 01:18:31.760
Stop him.

01:18:31.969 --> 01:18:34.199
Get him under control. Stop him!

01:18:42.613 --> 01:18:43.671
Anna!

01:18:44.115 --> 01:18:45.207
Anna!

01:18:48.019 --> 01:18:49.111
Anna!

01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:51.718
No! Don't kill him!

01:18:53.157 --> 01:18:54.181
Look out!

01:18:58.963 --> 01:19:00.555
Anna!

01:19:00.932 --> 01:19:02.729
Anna!

01:19:37.969 --> 01:19:39.596
Jesus Christ.

01:19:45.977 --> 01:19:48.207
- Anna! Anna!
- Oh, my God.

01:19:50.214 --> 01:19:51.579
Are you all right?

01:20:20.545 --> 01:20:23.036
Oh, my God. Mr. President?

01:20:23.881 --> 01:20:26.475
Barnes? Is that you?

01:20:46.137 --> 01:20:47.536
Mr. President.

01:20:50.808 --> 01:20:51.900
I've got you.

01:20:54.312 --> 01:20:56.974
- Can you sit up?
- Yeah.

01:21:07.692 --> 01:21:08.750
Are you injured?

01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:11.091
Yeah.

01:21:11.863 --> 01:21:13.763
It's not important.

01:21:24.775 --> 01:21:26.766
This is Agent Thomas Barnes.

01:21:27.812 --> 01:21:29.439
POTUS is in hand.

01:21:29.881 --> 01:21:32.714
I repeat, POTUS is in hand.

01:21:32.884 --> 01:21:37.184
We need a pickup
seven blocks east of the plaza.

01:21:41.025 --> 01:21:42.583
Thank you.

01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:45.490
- Thank you.
- No problem.

01:21:46.964 --> 01:21:50.058
Bye, Anna, bye.

01:22:00.878 --> 01:22:02.368
- Hello?
- <i>Oh, thank God.</i>

01:22:02.546 --> 01:22:05.344
- <i>Howard, are you okay? Are you hurt?</i>
- No, I'm...

01:22:05.516 --> 01:22:07.711
- <i>Are you sure? Are you okay?</i>
- I'm all right.

01:22:07.885 --> 01:22:11.252
<i>We were watching the news.</i>
<i>We got your message. You're all right?</i>

01:22:11.422 --> 01:22:13.083
- Yeah.
- <i>Because we were so worried.</i>

01:22:13.257 --> 01:22:14.724
- I'm fine.
- <i>Are you sure?</i>

01:22:14.892 --> 01:22:18.350
<i>The kids have been really concerned</i>
<i>about you. Nate wants to talk to you.</i>

01:22:18.529 --> 01:22:19.689
<i>I'm so glad you're okay.</i>

01:22:19.864 --> 01:22:23.300
- All right, put him on the phone for me.
- <i>Okay, all right, hold on.</i>

01:22:23.467 --> 01:22:25.196
<i>Here's your daddy, Nate.</i>
<i>He's okay.</i>

01:22:25.369 --> 01:22:27.166
Nate. That you?

01:22:27.338 --> 01:22:28.999
<i>Hi, Dad.</i>

01:22:29.307 --> 01:22:31.002
How you doing, buddy?

01:22:31.175 --> 01:22:33.609
<i>I'm okay. I'm fine.</i>

01:22:33.778 --> 01:22:35.302
Don't you worry about anything.

01:22:35.479 --> 01:22:37.174
- <i>Will you be coming back?</i>
- Yeah.

01:22:38.049 --> 01:22:42.076
Tell your mom that I'm coming home
right now. I love you guys.

01:22:43.454 --> 01:22:45.922
Back off, sir. Back off.

01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:50.621
Thank you, Thomas.

01:22:54.332 --> 01:22:56.163
You're welcome, sir.

01:23:18.222 --> 01:23:20.053
<i>Reports out of Salamanca</i>
<i>now suggest...</i>

01:23:20.224 --> 01:23:22.454
<i>... that the president</i>
<i>is out of intensive care.</i>

01:23:22.626 --> 01:23:24.423
<i>His condition is listed as stable.</i>

01:23:24.595 --> 01:23:26.529
<i>President Ashton</i>
<i>has made a point...</i>

01:23:26.697 --> 01:23:29.165
<i>... of reassuring Americans</i>
<i>that he's all right...</i>

01:23:29.333 --> 01:23:32.166
<i>... and the summit will continue</i>
<i>in the days to come.</i>

01:23:32.703 --> 01:23:35.672
Meanwhile, word from Spanish
and United States authorities...

01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:39.833
...is that they've shot and killed the lone
assassin responsible for today's attack.

01:23:40.011 --> 01:23:42.007
Our own Joan Kendrick has more.
