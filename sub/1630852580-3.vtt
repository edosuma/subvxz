00:09.909 --> 00:12.679
<i>- Pitcher, right?</i>
<i>- Don't tip it over.</i>

00:12.746 --> 00:14.914
<i>He's a new ladies man.</i>

00:15.015 --> 00:18.051
<i>Hey, what up, gang?</i>
<i>Thank God you guys are back.</i>

00:18.151 --> 00:19.352
<i>We missed you.</i>

00:19.419 --> 00:21.755
<i>Show me how you flirt</i>
<i>without speaking.</i>

00:21.855 --> 00:24.257
<i>This might</i>
<i>get a little weird.</i>

00:24.357 --> 00:25.992
<i>Okay,</i>
<i>can I just smile at you?</i>

00:26.059 --> 00:28.261
<i>- There you go.</i>
<i>- Oh, wow.</i>

00:28.361 --> 00:29.763
<i>That was actually</i>
<i>pretty good.</i>

00:29.863 --> 00:32.165
<i>Who's home!</i>

00:32.232 --> 00:33.733
<i>Hey!</i>

00:33.833 --> 00:36.069
<i>Woman: Oh, hey!</i>

00:36.169 --> 00:38.104
<i>You took my place already?</i>

00:41.374 --> 00:43.777
<i>Okay, what are you</i>
<i>doing in her lap?</i>

00:46.713 --> 00:47.947
<i>This is a dare.</i>

00:48.048 --> 00:49.783
<i>It's been going on</i>
<i>for quite a while, actually.</i>

00:49.883 --> 00:52.952
<i>I'm trying not to crush her,</i>
<i>just so you know.</i>

00:53.053 --> 00:56.689
<i>Your mom walked in on a really</i>
<i>bad moment for my dad.</i>

00:56.756 --> 00:58.191
<i>Sitting in Deneia's lap</i>
<i>right now.</i>

00:58.258 --> 00:59.526
<i>Shut up.</i>

00:59.592 --> 01:01.127
<i>They're playing</i>
<i>truth or dare.</i>

01:01.227 --> 01:02.762
<i>We're down to one dare.</i>

01:02.862 --> 01:05.065
<i>I'm gonna give it</i>
<i>to my roommate.</i>

01:05.131 --> 01:06.199
<i>Alright.</i>

01:06.266 --> 01:07.634
<i>- It's your dare.</i>
<i>- Do I have an option?</i>

01:07.734 --> 01:08.968
<i>Man: You walked into it.</i>

01:09.069 --> 01:12.138
<i>Get tickled by the person</i>
<i>of your choice.</i>

01:12.238 --> 01:13.940
<i>Tickled?</i>
<i>Are you ticklish?</i>

01:14.040 --> 01:16.609
<i>Depe--</i>

01:16.709 --> 01:18.378
<i>Why?</i>

01:22.282 --> 01:25.218
I'm sitting on her lap.
There's things we've all done.

01:25.285 --> 01:26.653
<i>I licked Trish's arm.</i>

01:26.753 --> 01:28.655
<i>Oh, there might have been</i>
<i>some mouth-to-mouth feeding</i>

01:28.755 --> 01:29.756
- <i>going on here.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:29.823 --> 01:31.224
<i>Oh.</i>

01:31.291 --> 01:34.327
So other than that, everything's
been very calm at this house

01:34.427 --> 01:36.496
<i>since you guys</i>
<i>have been gone.</i>

01:36.596 --> 01:38.498
<i>- So who's gonna tickle you?</i>
<i>- Who's gonna tickle you?</i>

01:38.598 --> 01:39.599
<i>Who's gonna tickle you?</i>

01:39.666 --> 01:40.733
<i>I'm getting a little hot</i>
<i>in here.</i>

01:40.800 --> 01:41.901
<i>Geez, guys.</i>

01:43.970 --> 01:46.172
<i>Phill.</i>

01:46.272 --> 01:48.074
But I don't know where
her ticklish spot is.

01:48.141 --> 01:50.443
<i>- Well, find out.</i>
<i>- Find out, brother.</i>

01:50.510 --> 01:52.011
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:52.112 --> 01:53.079
<i>Let's see.</i>

01:53.146 --> 01:54.180
<i>Now I'm --</i>

01:54.280 --> 01:55.615
<i>I'm really hot now.</i>

01:55.682 --> 01:57.484
<i>You just came back</i>
<i>from that date with Philip.</i>

01:57.584 --> 02:00.019
<i>Troy: Yeah, and you're getting</i>
<i>tickled by another man.</i>

02:01.521 --> 02:02.856
<i>You didn't want to,</i>
<i>Troy.</i>

02:02.956 --> 02:03.923
<i>Ahh!</i>

02:05.792 --> 02:07.293
<i>- There she goes.</i>
<i>- The weak spot.</i>

02:07.360 --> 02:10.363
<i>Goddamn,</i>
<i>that's uncomfortable.</i>

02:10.463 --> 02:11.631
<i>Alright.</i>

02:11.698 --> 02:12.799
<i>She's a trooper.</i>

02:12.866 --> 02:15.301
<i>I didn't sign up for this.</i>

02:18.171 --> 02:19.706
<i>Yay!</i>

02:19.806 --> 02:21.708
<i>That was Jimmy,</i>
<i>just so you know.</i>

02:23.376 --> 02:26.513
<i>Yep.</i>

02:26.613 --> 02:28.648
<i>Noah: Do I look young?</i>

02:28.715 --> 02:29.782
<i>Yeah?</i>

02:29.849 --> 02:31.384
<i>Mm. Oh, yeah.</i>

02:31.484 --> 02:33.486
<i>Doesn't it feel</i>
<i>moisturizing, though?</i>

02:33.553 --> 02:36.055
<i>Okay.</i>

02:36.156 --> 02:38.158
<i>Am I gonna look cute?</i>

02:38.224 --> 02:43.363
<i>It's not a miracle worker,</i>
<i>but may help a little bit.</i>

02:43.463 --> 02:45.865
<i>Oh, yeah,</i>
<i>it's getting messy now.</i>

02:45.965 --> 02:47.800
<i>Sloppy, sloppy.</i>

03:02.048 --> 03:04.417
<i>Good day yesterday.</i>
<i>You guys had a nice time.</i>

03:04.517 --> 03:05.718
<i>It was fun.</i>

03:05.818 --> 03:07.253
<i>It was fun.</i>
<i>It was a lot of fun, yeah.</i>

03:07.353 --> 03:08.588
<i>It's all about</i>
<i>the quality time.</i>

03:08.688 --> 03:10.823
<i>I mean, you're not</i>
<i>gonna be here forever.</i>

03:10.890 --> 03:12.258
<i>Yeah.</i>

03:12.358 --> 03:13.927
<i>Take advantage, yeah.</i>

03:14.027 --> 03:15.428
<i>Mm-hmm. Absolutely.</i>

03:15.528 --> 03:19.566
<i>I had a great time with Karen,</i>
<i>but I did feel like</i>

03:19.666 --> 03:21.534
<i>I was stepping on Troy's toes</i>
<i>a bit</i>

03:21.601 --> 03:23.703
<i>because she's had</i>
<i>her eyes on him.</i>

03:23.770 --> 03:26.439
<i>I really feel like they should</i>
<i>get to know each other more.</i>

03:26.539 --> 03:28.441
<i>I love</i>
<i>our little morning --</i>

03:28.541 --> 03:31.110
<i>Our morning talks.</i>

03:31.211 --> 03:33.947
Yes. Yeah. We've got a little
tradition going, I guess.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.081
<i>Yeah. Oh.</i>

03:35.181 --> 03:36.382
<i>All: Aww.</i>

03:36.449 --> 03:38.117
<i>Holy shit.</i>
<i>They got chemistry.</i>

03:38.218 --> 03:39.619
<i>Like, it's so cute.</i>

03:39.719 --> 03:42.021
So -- It's so cute when they're
just smiling at each other.

03:42.088 --> 03:45.625
Clearly, something here
to explore and pursue and...

03:45.725 --> 03:47.560
<i>I'm with you.</i>

03:47.627 --> 03:49.395
<i>When I'm watching my dad,</i>
<i>I can't help</i>

03:49.462 --> 03:51.931
<i>but, you know, sometimes</i>
<i>I'll cringe a little bit.</i>

03:52.031 --> 03:54.234
<i>He's a little bit of a goof.</i>
<i>But for the most part,</i>

03:54.300 --> 03:56.736
<i>I think my dad's got --</i>

03:56.803 --> 03:58.771
<i>for lack of better words,</i>
<i>he's got game.</i>

03:58.871 --> 04:00.640
<i>Scale of 1 to 100,</i>
<i>where you at?</i>

04:00.740 --> 04:03.977
<i>99. </i>

04:04.077 --> 04:05.278
<i>Me too.</i>

04:20.760 --> 04:22.829
So what'd you think
about truth or dare last night?

04:22.929 --> 04:24.330
<i>It was fun.</i>

04:24.430 --> 04:27.233
It was fun. I have to get you
to be a little more daring.

04:29.435 --> 04:33.172
<i>You think that Myles would think</i>
<i>that I'm, you know,</i>

04:33.273 --> 04:34.240
<i>the perfect match?</i>

04:34.307 --> 04:35.308
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

04:35.408 --> 04:36.476
<i>He would have picked</i>
<i>Philip first</i>

04:36.576 --> 04:38.177
<i>because of the way</i>
<i>he looked.</i>

04:38.278 --> 04:41.347
<i>But I think just because</i>
<i>of who you are,</i>

04:41.447 --> 04:42.849
<i>like, just the things</i>
<i>that I like,</i>

04:42.949 --> 04:45.652
<i>like your personality,</i>
<i>your honesty,</i>

04:45.752 --> 04:49.255
<i>and just you being open</i>
<i>with some of the things</i>

04:49.322 --> 04:50.857
<i>that you've done</i>
<i>in the past.</i>

04:50.957 --> 04:52.592
<i>I think all of that --</i>

04:52.659 --> 04:54.627
<i>I think he will consider you</i>
<i>to be a good guy.</i>

04:54.694 --> 04:56.863
<i>You know, I'm not perfect</i>
<i>by any means.</i>

04:56.963 --> 04:59.332
<i>Have I ever cheated?</i>

04:59.432 --> 05:03.036
I have, but each and every day,
I'm trying to be the best man

05:03.136 --> 05:04.370
<i>that I can be,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

05:04.470 --> 05:06.606
Even if I don't succeed,
you know, I'm trying.

05:06.673 --> 05:07.807
<i>Yeah.</i>

05:07.874 --> 05:09.442
<i>Successful</i>
<i>breakfast conversation.</i>

05:09.509 --> 05:10.877
<i>Every time we see them,</i>
<i>I feel like</i>

05:10.977 --> 05:12.612
<i>it's just another level.</i>

05:12.679 --> 05:14.480
<i>Got vulnerable</i>
<i>a little bit, too.</i>

05:14.547 --> 05:16.382
<i>You know, it got deep.</i>
<i>That was good to see.</i>

05:16.482 --> 05:19.452
<i>MJ: Hearing Scott talking</i>
<i>about his past mistakes,</i>

05:19.519 --> 05:21.220
<i>That's a big red flag for me.</i>

05:21.321 --> 05:23.323
<i>I don't trust Scott</i>
<i>with my mom.</i>

05:23.389 --> 05:26.359
I feel like there's someone
perfect for each parent.

05:26.459 --> 05:28.861
I'm just saying, I think every
parent can be with someone,

05:28.961 --> 05:31.631
but there's certain parents
that the personalities

05:31.698 --> 05:34.300
might not match for,
like, the future, you know?

05:34.367 --> 05:39.038
<i>MJ's definitely skeptical</i>
<i>about my dad</i>

05:39.138 --> 05:40.873
<i>and Deneia's relationship.</i>

05:40.973 --> 05:42.909
<i>I'm worried because</i>

05:43.009 --> 05:46.079
<i>I definitely don't want</i>
<i>to see my dad heartbroken.</i>

05:46.179 --> 05:47.413
<i>Noah: Oh, they're back</i>
<i>in these seats, bro.</i>

05:47.513 --> 05:50.583
<i>- Look at her shades.</i>
<i>- Very cool.</i>

05:50.683 --> 05:52.685
<i>So your day --</i>
<i>your day was good.</i>

05:52.752 --> 05:55.054
<i>Sounded just beautiful.</i>
<i>Getting out there.</i>

05:55.154 --> 05:58.424
<i>That was by far the most amazing</i>
<i>first date...</i>

05:58.524 --> 06:00.093
<i>That's awesome.</i>

06:00.193 --> 06:03.096
<i>I'm jealous because it should</i>
<i>have been Trish and Philip.</i>

06:03.196 --> 06:06.532
<i>There's something about Philip</i>
<i>that attracts me to him.</i>

06:06.599 --> 06:09.736
<i>To me,</i>
<i>you're like a peaceful person.</i>

06:09.836 --> 06:12.772
<i>You're a calming --</i>
<i>a calming man, I think.</i>

06:12.872 --> 06:15.274
- <i>Your dad's peaceful.</i>
<i>- He does have that aura.</i>

06:15.375 --> 06:17.844
Yeah, that's kind of his --
that's his usual vibe. Peaceful.

06:17.910 --> 06:19.245
<i>Trish: You know?</i>

06:19.345 --> 06:20.380
<i>I mean, I might say</i>
<i>other things, like,</i>

06:20.446 --> 06:21.948
<i>"Dang, he's hot."</i>

06:22.048 --> 06:23.549
<i>"He's fine and he looks like</i>
<i>he just</i>

06:23.616 --> 06:25.084
<i>dropped out</i>
<i>of a magazine</i>

06:25.184 --> 06:26.619
<i>and looks like one</i>
<i>of those holograms</i>

06:26.719 --> 06:28.621
that just show up. I don't even
think the man is real."

06:28.721 --> 06:31.591
<i>Mom, like, it's just</i>
<i>a little much.</i>

06:31.691 --> 06:33.960
<i>Like, there's some things</i>
<i>just don't talk out loud about,</i>

06:34.060 --> 06:36.696
<i>just keep it to yourself</i>
<i>or whisper or something.</i>

06:36.763 --> 06:39.966
He just shows up and even got
the men looking at him,

06:40.066 --> 06:43.035
<i>you know?</i>

06:43.102 --> 06:44.804
<i>Okay. </i>

06:44.904 --> 06:46.139
<i>Hell yeah, Tricia.</i>

06:46.239 --> 06:48.107
<i>She's the funniest</i>
<i>little turtle.</i>

06:48.207 --> 06:49.442
<i>Turtle?</i>

06:49.542 --> 06:51.277
<i>I've been really blessed</i>
<i>in my life.</i>

06:51.377 --> 06:53.646
<i>I feel like there's a god</i>
<i>guiding me</i>

06:53.746 --> 06:57.650
<i>and filling my heart</i>
<i>with joy and peace.</i>

06:57.750 --> 06:59.118
<i>Well, you can tell,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

06:59.218 --> 07:00.787
<i>And that's the thing</i>
<i>I see about you, too.</i>

07:00.887 --> 07:03.423
<i>Yeah.</i>

07:03.489 --> 07:05.758
<i>Oh, well, thank you.</i>

07:05.825 --> 07:06.959
<i>to be able to be here.</i>

07:07.059 --> 07:09.896
<i>- Oh.</i>
<i>- That is super sweet.</i>

07:09.962 --> 07:11.664
<i>No, I haven't been to church</i>
<i>in a while.</i>

07:11.764 --> 07:13.933
You know, me and God
have our own thing, but...

07:14.000 --> 07:15.168
<i>Yeah.</i>

07:15.268 --> 07:16.436
<i>You make me want</i>
<i>to go to church.</i>

07:16.502 --> 07:19.472
<i>You make me want to be</i>
<i>a better person.</i>

07:19.572 --> 07:21.908
I'm already -- I mean, I think
I'm pretty cool already.

07:21.974 --> 07:23.810
<i>Yes, you absolutely are.</i>

07:23.910 --> 07:28.181
<i>You're a beautiful person.</i>

07:28.281 --> 07:30.316
<i>You know, like,</i>
<i>it woke me up.</i>

07:30.416 --> 07:31.651
<i>- Aw.</i>
<i>- Oh, shit.</i>

07:31.751 --> 07:33.252
<i>Aww.</i>

07:33.319 --> 07:35.188
<i>So weird seeing her cry.</i>
<i>She's never --</i>

07:35.288 --> 07:36.355
<i>She never cries.</i>

07:36.456 --> 07:39.459
<i>Even though</i>
<i>I believe in God</i>

07:39.525 --> 07:41.694
<i>and I'm a big</i>
<i>family-oriented woman,</i>

07:41.794 --> 07:45.698
<i>but there's that lacking,</i>
<i>which is going to church,</i>

07:45.798 --> 07:48.034
<i>'cause I'm like,</i>
<i>"If I'm like this now,</i>

07:48.134 --> 07:49.368
<i>how much more of a woman</i>

07:49.469 --> 07:50.837
<i>I could be</i>
<i>if I practice every day?"</i>

07:50.937 --> 07:52.805
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

07:52.872 --> 07:54.841
<i>Okay. Oh, that's beautiful.</i>

07:54.941 --> 07:56.342
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

07:56.442 --> 07:58.678
<i>- Aww.</i>
<i>- Aww.</i>

07:58.778 --> 07:59.979
<i>That's amazing.</i>

08:00.046 --> 08:02.181
<i>That was really heartfelt.</i>

08:02.281 --> 08:03.549
<i>That was</i>
<i>really heartfelt.</i>

08:03.649 --> 08:05.885
<i>- Hey, can I get a hug?</i>
<i>- Yes, please.</i>

08:05.985 --> 08:06.886
<i>Oh, good.</i>

08:06.986 --> 08:08.120
<i>Noah: Oh, that's so sweet.</i>

08:08.187 --> 08:09.288
<i>She needed that.</i>

08:09.355 --> 08:10.656
<i>So I just wanted</i>
<i>to tell you that.</i>

08:10.723 --> 08:12.992
<i>Thank you.</i>

08:13.059 --> 08:15.228
<i>Okay?</i>
<i>But that's not what attracts me.</i>

08:15.328 --> 08:19.966
<i>What attracts me more</i>
<i>is his love for God and family.</i>

08:20.032 --> 08:23.970
<i>His whole spirit aura</i>
<i>is unique,</i>

08:24.036 --> 08:26.305
<i>like no other man</i>
<i>I've ever seen or met.</i>

08:26.372 --> 08:27.740
<i>I really appreciate you</i>
<i>sharing that.</i>

08:27.840 --> 08:29.642
<i>I really do.</i>

08:29.709 --> 08:33.012
<i>Yeah, well, hearing it from you</i>
<i>means a lot.</i>

08:33.079 --> 08:36.649
Aww. I just feel like they are
the best of friends.

08:36.716 --> 08:37.917
<i>Yeah.</i>

08:38.017 --> 08:39.085
<i>Oh, definitely.</i>

08:39.185 --> 08:41.320
<i>I appreciate that.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

08:41.387 --> 08:42.755
<i>If she's like this,</i>
<i>like, single,</i>

08:42.855 --> 08:46.392
<i>how's she gonna be in love?</i>
<i>It'll be good.</i>

08:55.868 --> 08:57.737
So what do guys think of, like,
your parents so far?

08:57.837 --> 08:59.372
<i>Have they connected</i>
<i>with anybody?</i>

08:59.438 --> 09:00.740
Is there anybody that you think
would be good for them?

09:00.840 --> 09:03.175
<i>Honestly, the way</i>
<i>that I'm seeing</i>

09:03.242 --> 09:04.610
<i>my mom talk to Troy,</i>

09:04.710 --> 09:06.212
<i>I can tell</i>
<i>she's really comfortable</i>

09:06.279 --> 09:08.214
<i>and opening herself up</i>
<i>a lot.</i>

09:08.281 --> 09:10.883
<i>I mean, I see that going</i>
<i>a really good way.</i>

09:10.950 --> 09:12.084
<i>Yeah, I agree.</i>

09:12.184 --> 09:14.053
<i>Who knows?</i>
<i>Anything can happen, you know?</i>

09:14.120 --> 09:16.289
<i>That's true.</i>

09:16.389 --> 09:18.391
<i>Hello?</i>

09:18.457 --> 09:19.725
<i>Whoa.</i>

09:19.792 --> 09:21.227
<i>- Hi!</i>
<i>- How's it going?</i>

09:21.294 --> 09:23.296
<i>What the heck is going on?</i>

09:23.396 --> 09:24.964
<i>Hello.</i>

09:25.064 --> 09:26.566
<i>Oh, hello.</i>

09:26.632 --> 09:30.036
<i>MJ: It's kind of shocking to see</i>
<i>new people in a bunker house,</i>

09:30.102 --> 09:31.771
<i>so we were just all confused.</i>

09:31.871 --> 09:34.140
<i>- How y'all doing?</i>
<i>- I'm Brendan.</i>

09:34.240 --> 09:35.541
<i>- Myles, man. Nice to meet you.</i>
<i>- Myles?</i>

09:35.608 --> 09:36.642
<i>- Destiny.</i>
<i>- Noah. It's nice to meet you.</i>

09:36.742 --> 09:38.311
<i>Noah, nice to meet you.</i>

09:38.411 --> 09:40.913
<i>Oh, wait. Are there more people</i>
<i>about to show up in this house?</i>

09:40.980 --> 09:42.615
<i>I thought it was just us,</i>

09:42.715 --> 09:44.483
<i>and now that there's new people</i>
<i>in the house, I'm just worried.</i>

09:44.584 --> 09:47.086
<i>How's that gonna affect the</i>
<i>relationships already formed?</i>

09:47.153 --> 09:48.621
<i>Like, what's gonna happen?</i>

09:48.721 --> 09:50.556
<i>Oh, what the --</i>

09:50.623 --> 09:51.757
<i>This is like</i>
<i>"The Truman Show," man.</i>

09:51.824 --> 09:53.659
<i>Destiny:</i>
<i>This is interesting.</i>

09:53.759 --> 09:55.161
<i>We should probably</i>
<i>explain everything.</i>

09:55.261 --> 09:56.262
<i>- Yes, please do.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

09:56.329 --> 09:57.730
<i>Let us --</i>
<i>Give us the rundown.</i>

09:57.797 --> 09:58.931
<i>I have no idea</i>
<i>what's going on.</i>

09:58.998 --> 10:01.734
<i>- This looks weird.</i>
<i>- Oh, my goodness.</i>

10:01.801 --> 10:03.669
<i>The parents don't know</i>
<i>we have all this.</i>

10:03.769 --> 10:06.105
<i>So normally</i>
<i>if something comes up</i>

10:06.172 --> 10:07.807
<i>or if</i>
<i>there's, like, an event,</i>

10:07.907 --> 10:10.176
<i>we'll be able to, like,</i>
<i>spice up the dates</i>

10:10.276 --> 10:12.278
<i>and kind of, like,</i>
<i>do a little something.</i>

10:12.345 --> 10:13.346
<i>Oh, it's my turn now.</i>
<i>Perfect.</i>

10:13.446 --> 10:15.514
<i>We call it meddling.</i>

10:15.615 --> 10:17.950
<i>The meddling</i>
<i>and the spying,</i>

10:18.017 --> 10:19.518
<i>definitely an overload.</i>

10:19.619 --> 10:22.688
<i>I had no idea that this was</i>
<i>what I was going to be doing.</i>

10:22.788 --> 10:24.824
<i>It was definitely a surprise</i>
<i>for both of us.</i>

10:24.924 --> 10:26.993
<i>And we'd always have</i>
<i>to sacrifice</i>

10:27.093 --> 10:29.095
<i>something</i>
<i>every time we meddle.</i>

10:29.161 --> 10:30.429
<i>It's super fun.</i>
<i>It's a little weird.</i>

10:30.496 --> 10:32.031
<i>You'll get settled in</i>
<i>and then, like,</i>

10:32.131 --> 10:34.500
<i>by tomorrow, you'll feel</i>
<i>right at home, I swear.</i>

10:34.600 --> 10:36.202
<i>Destiny: Wow, what is this?</i>

10:36.302 --> 10:38.504
<i>I am shocked.</i>

10:38.604 --> 10:40.306
<i>Favorite position?</i>

10:40.373 --> 10:41.874
<i>Think your dad just asked,</i>
<i>"What's your favorite position?"</i>

10:41.974 --> 10:44.210
<i>- Yeah, he did.</i>
<i>- Oh, yeah, I'm like...</i>

10:44.310 --> 10:46.379
<i>I haven't met too many positions</i>
<i>that I don't like.</i>

10:46.479 --> 10:49.148
<i>'Cause let's just realize</i>
<i>what's happening.</i>

10:49.215 --> 10:51.384
<i>- It gets really uncomfortable.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

10:51.484 --> 10:52.785
<i>So I've been there</i>
<i>for 30 seconds</i>

10:52.852 --> 10:54.887
<i>and already</i>
<i>talking about sex positions.</i>

10:54.987 --> 10:57.289
<i>Favorite position.</i>

10:57.356 --> 10:59.058
<i>Phill: Come on,</i>
<i>shouldn't be that hard.</i>

10:59.158 --> 11:00.726
<i>It shouldn't be.</i>

11:00.826 --> 11:02.862
<i>Um...</i>

11:04.830 --> 11:06.866
<i>I get tired on the top.</i>

11:09.402 --> 11:12.238
<i>So... </i>

11:12.338 --> 11:15.741
I like missionary from the back,
you know, whatever.

11:15.841 --> 11:16.742
<i>Whoa!</i>

11:19.979 --> 11:21.580
<i>Okay, Phill.</i>

11:21.681 --> 11:23.249
Myles' dad's gonna be like,
"See, I do something

11:23.349 --> 11:24.350
<i>called the Philly Special."</i>

11:25.751 --> 11:27.053
<i>And I'm pretty adventurous.</i>

11:27.153 --> 11:28.988
<i>Oh.</i>

11:29.055 --> 11:31.023
<i>Woman: I could see that.</i>
<i>I could see that.</i>

11:31.090 --> 11:33.092
<i>This conversation needs to end</i>
<i>right now.</i>

11:33.192 --> 11:35.027
<i>Philip, come on,</i>
<i>holy water.</i>

11:35.094 --> 11:37.096
<i>So I said bottom.</i>

11:37.196 --> 11:38.264
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

11:38.364 --> 11:40.066
<i>She just wanted</i>
<i>to hear him say it again.</i>

11:42.501 --> 11:45.171
<i>They call PJ's dad</i>
<i>"Holy water."</i>

11:45.237 --> 11:47.707
<i>They think he's, like,</i>
<i>beautiful, very...</i>

11:47.773 --> 11:49.275
<i>Face like God.</i>

11:49.375 --> 11:51.210
<i>I can see it.</i>
<i>I can see it.</i>

11:51.277 --> 11:53.179
<i>- I have a serious question.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

11:53.245 --> 11:56.582
<i>Has anyone dated outside</i>
<i>of their race before?</i>

11:56.682 --> 11:58.250
<i>Mm.</i>

11:58.350 --> 11:59.952
<i>Most definitely I have.</i>

12:00.052 --> 12:01.787
<i>I've really</i>
<i>never had a type.</i>

12:01.887 --> 12:03.255
<i>You know, I think</i>
<i>all women are beautiful</i>

12:03.355 --> 12:05.124
<i>and who I connect with</i>
<i>and, you know,</i>

12:05.224 --> 12:08.461
<i>develop that attraction with</i>
<i>is varied, so for sure.</i>

12:09.729 --> 12:12.398
<i>I mean, I'm biracial,</i>
<i>so I don't care.</i>

12:12.465 --> 12:14.133
<i>I had to deal</i>
<i>with that growing up,</i>

12:14.233 --> 12:15.701
<i>but I hear it</i>
<i>from both sides.</i>

12:15.768 --> 12:18.637
So it's like Black folks,
white folks -- I don't care.

12:18.738 --> 12:19.772
<i>Deneia?</i>

12:19.872 --> 12:21.073
<i>So once.</i>

12:21.140 --> 12:22.475
<i>White guy,</i>
<i>he was a bartender</i>

12:22.575 --> 12:24.043
<i>at one</i>
<i>of my favorite restaurants.</i>

12:24.110 --> 12:26.312
<i>I don't even know that.</i>

12:26.412 --> 12:28.481
<i>Nope.</i>

12:28.581 --> 12:29.749
<i>because I always say</i>

12:29.815 --> 12:32.218
<i>I am a Black girl</i>
<i>with Black parents</i>

12:32.284 --> 12:34.754
<i>and everybody</i>
<i>around me is Black,</i>

12:34.820 --> 12:38.224
<i>so I think I was like, "Oh,</i>
<i>does he know I can't get in --</i>

12:38.290 --> 12:39.391
<i>We can't get</i>
<i>in the shower together</i>

12:39.458 --> 12:40.626
<i>if my hair is not braided</i>

12:40.726 --> 12:42.461
<i>because this will turn</i>
<i>into an afro"?</i>

12:42.561 --> 12:44.130
<i>You know what I mean?</i>
<i>I always just think</i>

12:44.230 --> 12:45.765
<i>of all kinds of things,</i>
<i>so I think I overthought it.</i>

12:45.831 --> 12:47.333
<i>But, like,</i>
<i>he really liked me.</i>

12:47.433 --> 12:49.735
<i>And, you know,</i>
<i>we had a good time together,</i>

12:49.802 --> 12:51.504
<i>but it was just me,</i>
<i>like, in my head.</i>

12:51.604 --> 12:54.840
<i>I think me being accepted,</i>
<i>maybe by his parents...</i>

12:54.940 --> 12:57.409
<i>Trish: Yeah, yeah.</i>
<i>The whole thought process.</i>

12:57.476 --> 13:00.780
<i>You just don't know how,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

13:00.846 --> 13:02.581
<i>Hearing my mom talking</i>
<i>about dating</i>

13:02.648 --> 13:04.183
<i>outside of her race</i>
<i>is really sad.</i>

13:04.283 --> 13:07.520
<i>She's scared how the family</i>
<i>will think about her.</i>

13:07.620 --> 13:09.855
<i>I don't care if my mom</i>
<i>is talking</i>

13:09.955 --> 13:11.924
<i>to someone</i>
<i>outside of her race.</i>

13:11.991 --> 13:13.526
<i>You know, if she really</i>
<i>does like someone,</i>

13:13.626 --> 13:15.461
<i>then she should go for it.</i>

13:15.528 --> 13:19.165
<i>I just don't think Scott</i>
<i>is the right one for my mom.</i>

13:19.265 --> 13:22.101
Wow, what a conversation
to make an entrance on, though.

13:22.168 --> 13:23.702
<i>I know.</i>
<i>That's what I'm saying, man.</i>

13:23.803 --> 13:26.672
<i>Breana: I'm feeling very nervous</i>
<i>because everything's</i>

13:26.772 --> 13:28.274
<i>been going so smoothly.</i>

13:28.340 --> 13:29.809
<i>Adding these new people in</i>

13:29.875 --> 13:33.712
<i>definitely could change</i>
<i>the dynamic between everyone.</i>

13:36.048 --> 13:37.716
<i>Alright.</i>

13:37.817 --> 13:39.285
<i>Thank you so much</i>
<i>for having me.</i>

13:39.351 --> 13:41.554
Of course, my name is Jimmy.
I'm the retreat manager.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.856
<i>Thank you, Jimmy.</i>

13:43.956 --> 13:45.524
<i>I appreciate you.</i>

13:46.992 --> 13:49.495
<i>Oh, goodness.</i>
<i>That's my mama.</i>

13:49.562 --> 13:52.498
<i>My mom is here</i>
<i>at the Second Chance Retreat</i>

13:52.565 --> 13:55.467
<i>because it's time for her</i>
<i>to find someone.</i>

13:55.534 --> 13:57.069
<i>She's 49 years old.</i>

13:57.169 --> 13:59.505
She's about to enter
into a new chapter of her life,

13:59.572 --> 14:02.174
and she needs someone to share
those amazing times with.

14:02.241 --> 14:05.244
On this journey, it's really
looking to relinquish

14:05.344 --> 14:09.715
this kind of mother role
and step into Kiki, the woman.

14:12.318 --> 14:14.520
<i>I will put myself out there</i>
<i>vulnerably.</i>

14:14.587 --> 14:16.922
<i>Like,</i>
<i>I came here to find love.</i>

14:17.022 --> 14:18.257
<i>Oh!</i>

14:19.491 --> 14:23.162
<i>- Oh, hey.</i>
<i>- Oh!</i>

14:23.229 --> 14:25.197
<i>- Hi.</i>
<i>- Hi!</i>

14:25.264 --> 14:27.266
<i>I feel like fresh meat</i>
<i>out here.</i>

14:30.035 --> 14:31.237
<i>Karen.</i>

14:31.337 --> 14:32.438
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>

14:32.538 --> 14:33.672
<i>remember the names</i>
<i>just yet,</i>

14:33.739 --> 14:34.773
<i>but I'll get there.</i>

14:34.874 --> 14:36.508
<i>Hi, Troy. How are you?</i>

14:36.575 --> 14:37.910
<i>Look at her.</i>

14:38.010 --> 14:40.012
<i>"I'm gonna put this down</i>
<i>so I've got two hands."</i>

14:44.283 --> 14:45.351
<i>Aww.</i>

14:45.417 --> 14:47.286
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

14:47.386 --> 14:51.290
<i>My first impression, just</i>
<i>from the initial appearance...</i>

14:51.390 --> 14:52.391
<i>Hi!</i>

14:52.458 --> 14:54.627
<i>...Kiki is looking good.</i>

14:54.727 --> 14:57.730
Well, here's to surprises
at the Second Chance Retreat.

14:59.598 --> 15:00.866
<i>Welcome, Kiki.</i>

15:00.933 --> 15:03.569
<i>- Welcome, Kiki. Yes, yes.</i>
<i>- Thank you. Thank you.</i>

15:03.636 --> 15:05.037
<i>Well, where are you from?</i>

15:05.104 --> 15:06.639
<i>I'm from New York City.</i>

15:06.739 --> 15:07.973
<i>Manhattan, specifically.</i>

15:08.073 --> 15:09.541
<i>Manhattan girl, yeah.</i>

15:09.608 --> 15:11.443
<i>Anybody, like,</i>
<i>connecting with...?</i>

15:11.543 --> 15:12.711
<i>Yes.</i>

15:12.778 --> 15:14.980
<i>Trish: I think so.</i>

15:15.080 --> 15:15.981
<i>I speak for myself.</i>

15:16.081 --> 15:17.249
<i>So who's available then?</i>

15:17.316 --> 15:19.151
<i>Like, you know,</i>
<i>if I lay my hand on,</i>

15:19.251 --> 15:21.253
<i>you'd be like, "Huh, baby,</i>
<i>that's not the right one</i>

15:21.320 --> 15:22.588
<i>to lay your hand on."</i>

15:24.823 --> 15:26.058
<i>Hi.</i>

15:26.125 --> 15:27.927
<i>Welcome to the house.</i>
<i>I'm Jimmy.</i>

15:27.993 --> 15:31.330
<i>Jimmy, so nice to meet you.</i>
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

15:31.430 --> 15:33.499
<i>Oh, what's up, Mama?</i>

15:33.599 --> 15:35.067
<i>A little bit.</i>

15:38.070 --> 15:39.571
<i>When I saw Brennen,</i>
<i>I had no idea</i>

15:39.638 --> 15:41.240
<i>what to expect</i>
<i>from his mom,</i>

15:41.307 --> 15:44.176
<i>and she walks in</i>
<i>looking beautiful.</i>

15:44.276 --> 15:47.112
<i>Caught me off guard.</i>

15:47.179 --> 15:48.747
<i>Oh, there we go.</i>

15:48.814 --> 15:50.783
<i>All: Oh!</i>

15:50.849 --> 15:53.018
<i>- How are you?</i>
<i>- Hi.</i>

15:53.118 --> 15:55.087
<i>- Hi!</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

15:55.154 --> 15:56.989
<i>Scott: The energy</i>
<i>is already buzzing.</i>

15:57.089 --> 16:00.125
<i>Let's turn that up a notch,</i>
<i>because here comes Stephanie.</i>

16:00.192 --> 16:01.360
<i>She's stunningly beautiful.</i>

16:01.460 --> 16:02.695
<i>Hi.</i>

16:02.795 --> 16:03.696
<i>Scott, nice to meet you.</i>

16:03.796 --> 16:04.964
<i>It's very nice</i>
<i>to meet you.</i>

16:05.030 --> 16:06.699
<i>Yeah, it's gonna</i>
<i>shake things up a bit.</i>

16:06.799 --> 16:08.534
<i>And this is gonna spill</i>
<i>before I can drink it.</i>

16:08.634 --> 16:10.102
<i>Philip, hi.</i>
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>

16:10.169 --> 16:11.437
<i>Pleasure to meet you.</i>

16:11.503 --> 16:13.372
<i>Wow, this is starting</i>
<i>to get interesting.</i>

16:13.472 --> 16:15.808
<i>Karen: Hi, nice to meet you.</i>
<i>Pleasure.</i>

16:15.874 --> 16:17.609
<i>Ah, she's doing great.</i>

16:17.676 --> 16:19.478
<i>There we go,</i>
<i>another element of surprise.</i>

16:19.545 --> 16:21.347
<i>Stephanie: Yes.</i>

16:21.447 --> 16:23.716
<i>Oh, you did?</i>

16:23.816 --> 16:25.484
<i>I am nominating my mom,</i>
<i>Stephanie,</i>

16:25.551 --> 16:28.387
for Second Chance Retreat
because she deserves

16:28.487 --> 16:30.356
<i>to be happy</i>
<i>and to find love.</i>

16:30.456 --> 16:32.558
<i>My mom, Stephanie,</i>
<i>is a firecracker.</i>

16:32.658 --> 16:34.526
<i>She's full of energy.</i>

16:34.626 --> 16:37.296
She's got a lot of love to give
and is incredibly loyal.

16:37.363 --> 16:40.032
And it's time that, you know,
she takes off the pants

16:40.132 --> 16:41.867
<i>and can put on the dress.</i>

16:41.967 --> 16:43.969
<i>And I have it on today.</i>

16:44.036 --> 16:44.970
<i>Halfway there.</i>

16:46.505 --> 16:48.674
<i>Well, I feel like we need</i>
<i>to welcome our two guests.</i>

16:48.741 --> 16:50.809
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- With a toast, right?</i>

16:50.876 --> 16:52.044
<i>Yes. Yes.</i>

16:52.144 --> 16:54.213
<i>Trish: Welcome our new</i>
<i>beautiful ladies.</i>

16:54.313 --> 16:55.581
<i>Yeah, I'mma stand</i>
<i>for the toast.</i>

16:55.681 --> 16:56.882
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- Wow.</i>

16:56.982 --> 16:59.051
<i>To new friends.</i>

16:59.151 --> 17:00.586
<i>Listen, let us not forget,</i>
<i>honey.</i>

17:03.055 --> 17:05.424
<i>I don't mind more, but I'm</i>
<i>looking for the love of my life.</i>

17:05.524 --> 17:07.493
<i>Let's just be clear.</i>

17:07.559 --> 17:10.029
<i>Aww.</i>

17:10.095 --> 17:11.563
<i>Anything fun?</i>

17:11.663 --> 17:13.265
<i>- Hello.</i>
<i>- Hello.</i>

17:13.365 --> 17:16.268
<i>Ms. Yvonne,</i>
<i>thank you for coming back.</i>

17:16.368 --> 17:17.669
<i>You guys have gotten</i>
<i>the chance</i>

17:17.736 --> 17:19.872
<i>to spy in on your parents</i>
<i>a little bit.</i>

17:19.938 --> 17:21.073
<i>How's it going?</i>

17:21.173 --> 17:22.274
<i>- It's exciting.</i>

17:23.609 --> 17:25.110
<i>Alright,</i>
<i>Destiny and Brennen,</i>

17:25.210 --> 17:26.445
<i>you all, as you've seen,</i>

17:26.545 --> 17:28.280
<i>get the opportunity</i>
<i>to watch your parents</i>

17:28.380 --> 17:30.783
<i>at the Second Chance Retreat,</i>
<i>and they have no idea,</i>

17:30.883 --> 17:35.087
<i>and you all get to hook</i>
<i>your parents up on a date.</i>

17:35.187 --> 17:36.522
<i>Mm.</i>

17:36.588 --> 17:39.591
<i>And you get to decide</i>
<i>which father they go out with.</i>

17:39.691 --> 17:40.759
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

17:40.859 --> 17:42.795
<i>Yeah. Well, who do you think</i>
<i>your mom is?</i>

17:42.895 --> 17:44.863
<i>Troy.</i>

17:45.898 --> 17:47.366
<i>- Why Troy?</i>
<i>- Why Troy?</i>

17:47.433 --> 17:49.768
She's just -- I mean,
he just seems pretty easygoing.

17:49.868 --> 17:52.871
He's funny. He's got the looks
that she goes for normally.

17:52.938 --> 17:54.473
<i>I just think they'd get along</i>
<i>really well.</i>

17:54.573 --> 17:56.975
<i>Okay. Phenomenal.</i>
<i>Who does Kiki have her eye on?</i>

17:57.076 --> 17:58.777
<i>I think Philip.</i>

17:58.877 --> 18:02.081
<i>I think there's some initial</i>
<i>chemistry there.</i>

18:02.147 --> 18:04.483
<i>Alright. Well, I'm gonna head on</i>
<i>over to the retreat</i>

18:04.583 --> 18:06.318
<i>and meet your moms</i>
<i>for the first time</i>

18:06.418 --> 18:07.719
<i>and let them know</i>
<i>who their first</i>

18:07.786 --> 18:09.621
<i>one-on-one encounter</i>
<i>will be with tonight.</i>

18:09.721 --> 18:13.659
<i>Yeah.</i>

18:13.759 --> 18:15.828
<i>I don't want to guide her</i>
<i>in the wrong direction.</i>

18:15.928 --> 18:17.763
<i>I don't want to point her</i>
<i>to someone</i>

18:17.830 --> 18:20.299
<i>that it won't work with,</i>

18:20.399 --> 18:22.067
<i>so it's kind of terrifying.</i>

18:27.806 --> 18:29.441
<i>Knock, knock, knock.</i>

18:29.508 --> 18:31.944
- <i>Hello.</i>
<i>- Hey!</i>

18:32.010 --> 18:33.512
<i>I see some new faces.</i>

18:33.612 --> 18:34.680
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

18:34.780 --> 18:37.015
<i>Hello.</i>
<i>Okay, so, Kiki.</i>

18:37.116 --> 18:38.851
<i>Yes.</i>

18:38.951 --> 18:40.185
<i>or some time to get</i>
<i>to know --</i>

18:40.285 --> 18:41.787
<i>I've had some time</i>
<i>to get acquainted.</i>

18:41.854 --> 18:44.523
<i>Anybody tickling</i>
<i>your fancy?</i>

18:44.623 --> 18:46.425
<i>I would love to get</i>
<i>to know</i>

18:46.492 --> 18:48.660
<i>the gentleman sitting</i>
<i>next to me right here.</i>

18:48.760 --> 18:51.096
<i>- Oh!</i>
<i>- Whoa!</i>

18:51.163 --> 18:53.098
<i>Holy shit!</i>

18:53.165 --> 18:54.867
<i>Coming out of the gate hot.</i>

18:54.967 --> 18:57.536
Listen, I am staying open
to the endless possibilities.

18:57.636 --> 18:59.972
<i>Everyone wants</i>
<i>a little bit of holy water.</i>

19:00.038 --> 19:01.840
<i>Oh, holy water?</i>

19:01.940 --> 19:03.475
<i>Have you</i>
<i>been sprinkled already?</i>

19:04.943 --> 19:06.345
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

19:06.445 --> 19:08.380
<i>My dad is loving</i>
<i>this attention.</i>

19:10.282 --> 19:14.052
So, Stephanie, is there anyone
that has tickled your fancy?

19:14.153 --> 19:16.155
<i>I think</i>
<i>these guys are amazing.</i>

19:16.221 --> 19:18.557
<i>I'm not gonna make</i>
<i>any decisions at this point.</i>

19:18.657 --> 19:21.493
<i>I'm just loving to get to know</i>
<i>all the men here</i>

19:21.560 --> 19:22.895
<i>and see where it takes us.</i>

19:22.995 --> 19:25.998
<i>That was the "Stephanie</i>
<i>for president" answer.</i>

19:28.667 --> 19:31.370
<i>I promise to be open</i>
<i>and I'm going to do that.</i>

19:31.470 --> 19:32.704
<i>I'm not mad at this.</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

19:32.804 --> 19:34.206
<i>Listen.</i>

19:34.306 --> 19:35.908
<i>So for our two new moms,</i>

19:36.008 --> 19:37.910
<i>we have some dates lined up</i>
<i>for you tonight.</i>

19:38.010 --> 19:39.244
<i>- Oh.</i>
<i>- You have some dates?</i>

19:39.344 --> 19:40.879
<i>Some dates lined up.</i>

19:40.979 --> 19:42.047
<i>Ooh.</i>

19:42.147 --> 19:43.415
<i>Kiki, are you ready</i>
<i>to find out</i>

19:43.515 --> 19:44.917
<i>who you're going</i>
<i>on a date with tonight?</i>

19:45.017 --> 19:46.185
<i>Yes.</i>

19:47.419 --> 19:48.587
<i>That's what I came here for.</i>

19:48.687 --> 19:49.855
<i>You think I'm gonna be slow</i>
<i>and subtle?</i>

19:49.922 --> 19:51.156
<i>That's what</i>
<i>I came here for.</i>

19:52.724 --> 19:54.159
<i>I feel like you were about</i>
<i>to fight me.</i>

19:54.226 --> 19:56.595
<i>- I know.</i>
<i>- I haven't even</i>
<i>said the name yet.</i>

19:56.695 --> 19:59.097
<i>Now I'm scared.</i>
<i>Jesus wept.</i>

19:59.198 --> 20:01.200
<i>Alright.</i>

20:01.266 --> 20:03.569
<i>The dad selected to go</i>

20:03.669 --> 20:08.040
<i>on a lovely date</i>
<i>with Kiki tonight is...</i>

20:08.106 --> 20:09.374
<i>Philip.</i>

20:09.441 --> 20:10.609
<i>Whoo!</i>

20:10.709 --> 20:12.377
<i>Looks like</i>
<i>you got your wish.</i>

20:12.444 --> 20:15.414
Your dad is gonna have
the funnest date of his life.

20:15.514 --> 20:18.617
<i>- Oh, my gosh.</i>
<i>- I cannot wait for that.</i>

20:18.717 --> 20:21.286
<i>Destiny: I chose Philip</i>
<i>for my mom</i>

20:21.386 --> 20:25.591
<i>because he's nice eye candy,</i>
<i>so I know</i>

20:25.691 --> 20:27.025
<i>she's attracted to him.</i>

20:27.092 --> 20:29.428
Philip, how do you feel
about going on a date

20:29.528 --> 20:30.629
<i>with Kiki tonight?</i>

20:30.729 --> 20:32.064
<i>I feel like</i>
<i>it's a great idea.</i>

20:32.130 --> 20:33.699
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

20:34.900 --> 20:36.134
<i>Stephanie, are you ready</i>
<i>to find out</i>

20:36.235 --> 20:37.236
<i>who you're going on a date</i>
<i>with tonight?</i>

20:37.302 --> 20:38.971
<i>Absolutely.</i>

20:39.071 --> 20:42.975
Well, the dad selected to go
on a date with Stephanie is...

20:51.650 --> 20:52.884
<i>Troy.</i>

20:52.951 --> 20:54.553
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>- Ooh.</i>

20:54.620 --> 20:56.221
<i>- Troy got a date.</i>
<i>- Nice.</i>

20:56.288 --> 20:57.623
<i>Just so you know,</i>
<i>this is the first time</i>

20:57.723 --> 20:59.658
<i>this ever happened</i>
<i>to me in this spot.</i>

20:59.758 --> 21:00.993
<i>She always gives me</i>
<i>the look.</i>

21:01.093 --> 21:03.762
<i>She's like,</i>
<i>"And it's not you."</i>

21:05.063 --> 21:06.298
<i>Yvonne: How you feeling</i>
<i>about this?</i>

21:06.398 --> 21:07.666
<i>Very happy, yeah.</i>

21:07.766 --> 21:10.235
<i>I mean, just, you know,</i>
<i>like, blink twice.</i>

21:10.302 --> 21:12.838
<i>Very happy.</i>

21:12.938 --> 21:14.740
<i>Alright. Troy, you feeling</i>
<i>good about this?</i>

21:14.806 --> 21:15.907
<i>Yeah. I feel good.</i>

21:15.974 --> 21:17.342
<i>Okay. Well...</i>

21:17.442 --> 21:19.611
<i>Even though I've had</i>
<i>a special connection with Troy,</i>

21:19.678 --> 21:21.747
<i>I want him to be happy,</i>
<i>whether it's with me</i>

21:21.813 --> 21:23.148
<i>or another woman</i>
<i>in the house.</i>

21:23.248 --> 21:24.983
<i>It's his decision.</i>
<i>Just as much, you know --</i>

21:25.083 --> 21:26.585
<i>I can't be the only one</i>
<i>to want it,</i>

21:26.652 --> 21:28.153
<i>so it's got to come</i>
<i>from Troy as well.</i>

21:28.253 --> 21:30.522
<i>Enjoy. Have fun.</i>
<i>God bless.</i>

21:30.622 --> 21:32.024
<i>Thank you!</i>

21:32.124 --> 21:33.258
<i>She looked excited about it.</i>

21:33.325 --> 21:34.359
<i>I think</i>
<i>we did a pretty good job.</i>

21:34.459 --> 21:35.494
<i>I think you did well.</i>

21:35.594 --> 21:37.329
<i>I will say, typically,</i>

21:37.429 --> 21:38.764
<i>in my dad's history,</i>

21:38.830 --> 21:41.099
he's always been more of,
like, a brunette guy for sure.

21:41.166 --> 21:43.602
<i>I don't really know</i>
<i>if the color of the hair</i>

21:43.669 --> 21:44.670
<i>really does anything.</i>

21:44.770 --> 21:48.040
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>Stephanie is hot.</i>

21:48.140 --> 21:50.642
<i>And all of a sudden,</i>
<i>there's a love triangle</i>

21:50.709 --> 21:53.478
<i>with Stephanie, Troy,</i>
<i>and Karen.</i>

21:53.545 --> 21:55.981
<i>It could be</i>
<i>a sticky situation.</i>

21:56.048 --> 21:57.883
<i>Noah: Stephanie?</i>
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

21:57.983 --> 21:59.851
<i>You got a good-looking mom,</i>
<i>dude.</i>

22:02.154 --> 22:04.022
<i>Breana: I don't want my mom</i>
<i>to get hurt.</i>

22:04.122 --> 22:07.726
<i>And I hope my mom</i>
<i>keeps her options open</i>

22:07.826 --> 22:10.028
<i>and does not focus on Troy.</i>

22:10.128 --> 22:11.730
<i>In the nicest way possible.</i>

22:11.830 --> 22:13.632
I've been dealing with this
since I was like 14.

22:13.699 --> 22:14.566
<i>Yeah.</i>

22:20.172 --> 22:21.239
<i>Philip: Why don't you have</i>
<i>a seat here?</i>

22:21.340 --> 22:22.574
<i>Thank you.</i>

22:22.674 --> 22:24.242
<i>Charcuterie board.</i>

22:24.343 --> 22:26.044
<i>Alex: They look so good.</i>
<i>How romantic.</i>

22:26.144 --> 22:28.180
<i>Charcuterie.</i>

22:29.915 --> 22:31.383
<i>Look at that scenery.</i>

22:31.483 --> 22:33.719
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

22:33.819 --> 22:35.754
Not as beautiful as me,
but, yeah, it's beautiful.

22:35.854 --> 22:38.090
<i>Yeah, for sure. </i>

22:38.190 --> 22:43.762
<i>Destiny: My mother has eyes</i>
<i>for Philip.</i>

22:43.862 --> 22:45.931
<i>No lie,</i>
<i>Philip is a silver fox.</i>

22:46.031 --> 22:48.066
<i>Like, I'm not mad at it.</i>

22:48.166 --> 22:50.068
<i>You know what,</i>
<i>we haven't even toasted.</i>

22:50.168 --> 22:51.269
<i>We didn't. We didn't.</i>

22:51.370 --> 22:52.404
<i>You're good at toasting.</i>

22:52.504 --> 22:53.605
<i>I feel like we need</i>
<i>to toast.</i>

22:53.705 --> 22:54.740
<i>I think you should.</i>
<i>Go ahead.</i>

22:54.840 --> 22:57.109
<i>To...</i>

22:57.209 --> 22:59.444
<i>Uh...</i>

22:59.544 --> 23:00.679
<i>To, uh...</i>

23:03.715 --> 23:05.617
<i>...our acquaintance.</i>

23:05.717 --> 23:08.086
<i>And to...</i>

23:11.056 --> 23:12.924
<i>A wonderful night together.</i>

23:13.024 --> 23:14.025
<i>Destiny: He got it.</i>
<i>Don't worry.</i>

23:15.394 --> 23:17.129
<i>To a...</i>

23:17.229 --> 23:19.931
wonderful beginning
of a great relationship.

23:20.031 --> 23:22.401
<i>- You got it. It's okay.</i>
<i>- I'll toast to that.</i>

23:22.467 --> 23:24.269
<i>Okay.</i>

23:24.369 --> 23:25.971
<i>Solid finish.</i>

23:26.071 --> 23:28.907
<i>Solid finish.</i>

23:28.974 --> 23:30.976
<i>is quiet and a little reserved.</i>

23:31.076 --> 23:34.813
<i>And I'm like, "Okay,</i>
<i>I can do this."</i>

23:34.913 --> 23:37.816
<i>At the woman's...</i>
<i>they had, like, a 30-and-over</i>

23:37.916 --> 23:39.418
<i>where you can compete</i>
<i>and run.</i>

23:39.484 --> 23:42.154
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

23:42.254 --> 23:43.955
<i>Oh, my God, can wardrobe come?</i>

23:44.055 --> 23:45.557
<i>I'm, like, seeing areola.</i>

23:45.624 --> 23:47.259
<i>Oh, it's happening!</i>
<i>It's coming out.</i>

23:47.325 --> 23:48.260
<i>- Uh-oh.</i>
<i>- Help!</i>

23:48.326 --> 23:50.929
<i>- Oh, oh!</i>
<i>- Oh, my goodness!</i>

23:50.996 --> 23:54.666
I did not walk once. I was able
to make it around the track

23:54.766 --> 23:56.735
<i>and I reduced my time.</i>

23:56.802 --> 23:58.637
<i>Yes?</i>

23:58.737 --> 24:00.305
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

24:05.110 --> 24:10.582
<i>But can I tell you?</i>
<i>This is so -- This is so my mom.</i>

24:10.649 --> 24:13.652
<i>She's an amazing woman</i>
<i>and has a lot to offer,</i>

24:13.752 --> 24:18.490
<i>but, yeah, she needs</i>
<i>a little guidance and help.</i>

24:18.590 --> 24:20.325
<i>Janet Jackson moment.</i>
<i>It's all good.</i>

24:22.027 --> 24:24.329
<i>Now we're</i>
<i>better acquainted.</i>

24:26.097 --> 24:29.868
<i>Yeah, good. Yeah.</i>
<i>That's an icebreaker, for sure.</i>

24:32.637 --> 24:34.206
<i>I'm glad you're here.</i>

24:34.306 --> 24:36.174
<i>I really am.</i>

24:36.274 --> 24:38.009
<i>and I'm glad to be</i>
<i>on this date with you.</i>

24:44.316 --> 24:45.884
<i>Thank you.</i>

24:45.984 --> 24:47.652
<i>Now I'm blushing.</i>

24:47.719 --> 24:49.321
<i>Black women don't blush,</i>
<i>but I blush.</i>

24:52.457 --> 24:54.993
<i>Oh, my gosh, she is smitten.</i>

24:55.060 --> 24:57.796
<i>Yeah, you can see it</i>
<i>on her face.</i>

24:57.863 --> 24:59.231
<i>Yes, she is.</i>

24:59.331 --> 25:01.833
<i>So I'm hearing marriage</i>
<i>sometime in your future.</i>

25:01.900 --> 25:03.802
<i>Yeah, I'm -- definitely.</i>
<i>Yeah, for me, that's --</i>

25:03.869 --> 25:05.971
I'm looking for a wife to,
you know, really --

25:06.037 --> 25:08.073
<i>Because you're in</i>
<i>the final quarter of your life.</i>

25:08.173 --> 25:09.508
<i>I feel like, you know --</i>

25:09.574 --> 25:11.309
I'm a little behind you,
but, you know, okay,

25:11.376 --> 25:12.844
<i>go ahead, final quarter.</i>

25:12.911 --> 25:14.179
So that's why, you know, I have
an interest in, like,

25:14.246 --> 25:15.647
<i>you know,</i>
<i>when you got divorced,</i>

25:15.714 --> 25:17.382
<i>what were the circumstances</i>
<i>around that?</i>

25:17.482 --> 25:19.017
<i>You know, it's --</i>

25:19.084 --> 25:21.753
I feel like -- I really feel
like it was so long ago.

25:21.853 --> 25:23.321
<i>And so I think for me now,</i>

25:23.388 --> 25:26.258
<i>it's really about</i>
<i>what I learned from it.</i>

25:26.358 --> 25:30.262
And so I think for myself,
those days are done.

25:30.362 --> 25:31.530
<i>Uh...</i>

25:31.596 --> 25:33.098
<i>Philip: Yeah,</i>
<i>the past is the past,</i>

25:33.198 --> 25:36.368
<i>but there's things about</i>
<i>the past that tell you something</i>

25:36.434 --> 25:37.936
<i>about who you are now.</i>

25:38.036 --> 25:42.340
<i>Just that shield, the reluctance</i>
<i>to go into her past,</i>

25:42.407 --> 25:44.342
<i>that really is kind of</i>
<i>a red flag to me.</i>

25:51.883 --> 25:53.051
<i>Thank you.</i>

25:53.118 --> 25:54.452
<i>Troy: Wow.</i>

25:54.553 --> 25:58.023
I'm so excited to have an
opportunity to do one of these.

25:58.089 --> 25:59.224
<i>I know.</i>

25:59.291 --> 26:00.425
<i>Alright, Troy.</i>

26:00.525 --> 26:03.862
<i>First date with someone</i>
<i>who's not Karen.</i>

26:03.929 --> 26:05.897
<i>I tell you right away today.</i>

26:05.964 --> 26:07.899
<i>Oh, yeah, really cool</i>
<i>with your shades</i>

26:07.966 --> 26:09.801
<i>and little</i>
<i>salt and pepper.</i>

26:09.901 --> 26:11.303
<i>Yeah?</i>

26:11.403 --> 26:12.604
<i>Okay, I'll take that.</i>

26:12.704 --> 26:13.705
<i>Well, likewise/</i>

26:13.772 --> 26:15.473
<i>Both of these moms</i>
<i>is very bold.</i>

26:15.574 --> 26:16.741
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- Straightforward.</i>

26:16.808 --> 26:18.243
<i>They know what they want.</i>

26:18.310 --> 26:20.278
I'm a singer. I've been,
you know, a professional singer.

26:20.378 --> 26:23.381
<i>I started in Kansas City</i>
<i>when I was 16.</i>

26:23.448 --> 26:25.550
<i>That's funny.</i>
<i>My dad was also in a band</i>

26:25.617 --> 26:27.152
<i>in high school.</i>

26:27.252 --> 26:29.955
And you can see in his eyes,
he's about to bring it up.

26:30.055 --> 26:31.389
<i>So I played a band</i>
<i>in high school, too.</i>

26:31.456 --> 26:32.324
<i>Told you.</i>

26:32.424 --> 26:33.491
<i>What was it called?</i>

26:33.592 --> 26:34.793
<i>We were called As-Is.</i>

26:36.261 --> 26:37.896
<i>What would you call it today,</i>
<i>Has Been?</i>

26:37.963 --> 26:42.267
<i>Yeah, Has Been.</i>
<i>Yes, exactly. Has Been.</i>

26:42.334 --> 26:44.102
<i>He's playing it pretty cool,</i>
<i>which is why this is great.</i>

26:44.169 --> 26:45.637
<i>I mean, I want him</i>
<i>to try different things.</i>

26:45.737 --> 26:47.272
<i>That's why we're here</i>
<i>in the first place.</i>

26:47.339 --> 26:50.008
<i>- Oh.</i>
<i>- Oh, here we go.</i>

26:51.943 --> 26:53.845
<i>Brennen: "Option 'A' --</i>
<i>Send in Jimmy</i>

26:53.945 --> 26:58.016
<i>to recite a special romantic</i>
<i>poem to your mom and her date.</i>

26:58.116 --> 26:59.851
<i>Or option 'B' --</i>
<i>have Jimmy interrupt</i>

26:59.951 --> 27:01.353
<i>this date</i>
<i>and third wheel."</i>

27:01.453 --> 27:04.189
<i>Wait,</i>
<i>that would be so funny!</i>

27:04.289 --> 27:05.857
<i>I think I'm gonna go</i>
<i>with option "B."</i>

27:05.957 --> 27:07.025
<i>I picked option "B"</i>

27:07.125 --> 27:08.426
<i>because they seem bubbly</i>
<i>and upbeat,</i>

27:08.493 --> 27:10.028
<i>but I'm curious to see</i>
<i>how they would react</i>

27:10.128 --> 27:11.696
<i>to an awkward third wheel.</i>

27:11.796 --> 27:12.964
- <i>However...</i>
<i>- Oh, no.</i>

27:13.031 --> 27:15.667
<i>- Oh, my goodness.</i>
<i>- Yeah, let's see it.</i>

27:15.767 --> 27:18.203
<i>Brennen:</i>
<i>In order to meddle, you must</i>
<i>clean the bunker's bathrooms.</i>

27:18.303 --> 27:19.371
<i>Gross, dude.</i>

27:19.471 --> 27:21.206
<i>- Ew.</i>
<i>- Oh!</i>

27:21.306 --> 27:23.141
<i>Made it drop immediately.</i>

27:23.208 --> 27:25.610
<i>I wish to proceed, yes.</i>

27:27.812 --> 27:29.981
<i>I'm really clumsy when I talk</i>
<i>about these sorts of things,</i>

27:30.048 --> 27:32.784
<i>but how do you feel</i>
<i>about moving forward?</i>

27:32.851 --> 27:34.285
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>what are you looking for?</i>

27:34.352 --> 27:39.724
<i>Well, I'm a very --</i>
<i>Yeah, I've a very --</i>

27:39.824 --> 27:41.192
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>how to explain it, but...</i>

27:41.292 --> 27:43.561
<i>Bring in Jimmy.</i>

27:43.662 --> 27:45.630
<i>Let the magic happen.</i>

27:45.697 --> 27:47.232
<i>Like I do one thing,</i>
<i>I finish it,</i>

27:47.332 --> 27:48.733
<i>and then I do another thing,</i>
<i>I finish it,</i>

27:48.833 --> 27:50.568
<i>and I can't --</i>
<i>I'm not a multi-tasker.</i>

27:50.669 --> 27:52.070
<i>It's just --</i>

27:52.170 --> 27:53.805
and you just kind of wrap one
thing up and keep moving?

27:53.872 --> 27:55.707
<i>Yeah. So my focus</i>
<i>is my kids...</i>

27:55.807 --> 27:57.342
<i>...and my job</i>
<i>and feeding my kids.</i>

27:57.409 --> 27:58.877
<i>Noah: Oh, my gosh,</i>
<i>look at him.</i>

27:58.977 --> 28:00.345
<i>Let's go.</i>

28:00.412 --> 28:02.580
And the other, you know, dating,
whatever, was just --

28:02.681 --> 28:04.916
<i>I was just learning, you know,</i>
<i>because I was --</i>

28:05.016 --> 28:06.418
<i>got married at 18.</i>

28:06.518 --> 28:10.922
<i>I was married for 17 years</i>
<i>and I had zero experience.</i>

28:11.022 --> 28:12.757
<i>How is everything, guys?</i>

28:12.857 --> 28:14.092
<i>We haven't even tasted</i>
<i>the food.</i>

28:15.827 --> 28:17.362
<i>Okay, well,</i>
<i>don't mind me.</i>

28:17.429 --> 28:18.997
<i>Just continue. Please pretend</i>
<i>like I'm not here.</i>

28:21.866 --> 28:24.903
<i>Thank you, Jimmy.</i>

28:25.003 --> 28:26.604
<i>Oh. </i>

28:26.705 --> 28:28.106
<i>Are you listening in?</i>

28:28.206 --> 28:30.842
<i>Told you they were gonna</i>
<i>start laughing.</i>

28:30.909 --> 28:32.677
<i>Oh, where were we at?</i>

28:32.744 --> 28:34.345
<i>Well, we were talking about --</i>
<i>I was asking you</i>

28:34.412 --> 28:35.780
what are you kind of
looking for moving forward?

28:35.880 --> 28:38.283
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>So, you know, I was doing that.</i>

28:38.383 --> 28:41.286
<i>Sorry.</i>

28:41.386 --> 28:42.787
<i>I'm sorry. Continue.</i>

28:43.955 --> 28:46.391
<i>Okay.</i>

28:46.458 --> 28:48.727
I think, yeah, the table
just feels like it's wobbly.

28:48.793 --> 28:50.695
I was really afraid you were
gonna take those away.

28:50.762 --> 28:52.197
<i>I'm just gonna hold this.</i>

28:52.263 --> 28:54.799
Let's cheers again to a great
conversation so far.

28:56.568 --> 28:58.636
<i>You know what? I bought this</i>
<i>exact same table</i>

28:58.737 --> 29:00.405
<i>for my deck in Minnesota.</i>

29:00.472 --> 29:01.639
<i>Jimmy: Oh,</i>
<i>you're from Minnesota?</i>

29:01.740 --> 29:02.707
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

29:02.774 --> 29:03.808
<i>I've lived there</i>
<i>for 20 years.</i>

29:03.908 --> 29:05.810
<i>No way, dude!</i>
<i>This is awesome.</i>

29:05.910 --> 29:08.580
The apartment complex
I'm staying in, the alarm

29:08.646 --> 29:11.616
<i>went off</i>
<i>at 5:00 a.m. today.</i>

29:13.384 --> 29:15.286
<i>What?</i>

29:15.386 --> 29:17.555
<i>Oh, I was like,</i>
<i>"What is going on?"</i>

29:17.622 --> 29:19.591
<i>I'm new here to this,</i>
<i>so...</i>

29:21.926 --> 29:23.828
<i>Like, is this normal?</i>

29:23.928 --> 29:25.063
<i>Would it be, like, so rude</i>

29:25.130 --> 29:27.098
<i>if I just had, like,</i>
<i>a taste of that?</i>

29:27.165 --> 29:28.600
<i>Yes, because this</i>
<i>is, like, our date.</i>

29:28.666 --> 29:30.668
<i>You know, this is</i>
<i>Stephanie's, like, first thing,</i>

29:30.769 --> 29:32.504
<i>and she's thinking</i>
<i>she's here to meet people</i>

29:32.604 --> 29:33.972
<i>and she's gonna go through</i>
<i>a bunch of,</i>

29:34.072 --> 29:35.940
<i>you know, different dates</i>
<i>and things like that,</i>

29:36.007 --> 29:37.842
<i>and it just</i>
<i>was kind of, like,</i>

29:37.942 --> 29:39.611
<i>you know, I don't know, weird.</i>

29:39.677 --> 29:42.180
<i>Just a small boundary, Jimmy.</i>
<i>Not a hard one.</i>

29:42.280 --> 29:43.314
<i>But maybe after the date.</i>

29:43.414 --> 29:44.983
<i>I like a man</i>
<i>who has boundaries.</i>

29:45.083 --> 29:46.751
<i>And if we --</i>

29:46.818 --> 29:47.852
<i>Well, okay.</i>

29:47.952 --> 29:49.854
<i>Boundaries are good.</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

29:49.954 --> 29:52.190
<i>Maybe he's having</i>
<i>some kind of break or something,</i>

29:52.290 --> 29:53.258
<i>I don't know, really.</i>

29:54.325 --> 29:55.693
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

29:55.794 --> 29:57.595
<i>Troy knows that I never get</i>
<i>to hang out here,</i>

29:57.662 --> 29:59.330
<i>so every now and then --</i>

29:59.430 --> 30:01.266
<i>I've never been</i>
<i>on a date before.</i>

30:01.332 --> 30:03.101
<i>I didn't realize he was part</i>
<i>of the date.</i>

30:03.168 --> 30:04.969
<i>Oh, am I cramping</i>
<i>your style?</i>

30:05.036 --> 30:06.204
<i>I mean...</i>

30:06.304 --> 30:07.605
<i>Well, we were kind of on a roll,</i>
<i>Jimmy.</i>

30:07.672 --> 30:09.707
<i>You're feeling a vibe.</i>

30:14.312 --> 30:15.513
<i>Anyways...</i>

30:15.613 --> 30:16.681
<i>Cheers.</i>

30:16.781 --> 30:17.882
<i>To Jimmy.</i>

30:17.982 --> 30:18.983
<i>To Jimmy.</i>

30:19.050 --> 30:20.485
<i>To Jimmy Jam.</i>

30:20.552 --> 30:22.353
<i>Jammin' up the date.</i>

30:22.453 --> 30:23.822
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

30:23.888 --> 30:27.826
<i>When --</i>
<i>When my grandma passed away...</i>

30:30.061 --> 30:32.230
<i>You know, Jimmy, I don't want to</i>
<i>shoo you off,</i>

30:32.330 --> 30:33.898
<i>but we're...</i>

30:35.166 --> 30:38.136
<i>Okay, I feel like you guys</i>
<i>can say it nice.</i>

30:39.370 --> 30:41.306
<i>I love you, Jimmy.</i>
<i>We'll have more time.</i>

30:41.372 --> 30:42.841
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

30:45.343 --> 30:48.146
<i>It was a one time.</i>

30:48.213 --> 30:50.081
<i>Hmm.</i>

30:50.181 --> 30:51.382
<i>I don't know.</i>

30:51.482 --> 30:53.017
<i>So what were --</i>
<i>what were we talking about?</i>

30:53.084 --> 30:54.819
<i>I don't know.</i>

30:54.886 --> 30:56.521
<i>It actually kind of killed</i>
<i>the vibe</i>

30:56.588 --> 30:57.655
<i>a little bit on the date.</i>

30:57.722 --> 30:58.690
<i>It was so awkward.</i>

31:02.660 --> 31:06.431
<i>PJ: "Tonight, you will all</i>
<i>decide on two Mom and Dad pairs</i>

31:06.531 --> 31:10.101
<i>to be offered a private Romance</i>
<i>Room for some pillow talk</i>

31:10.201 --> 31:12.770
<i>and one-on-one bonding time."</i>

31:12.871 --> 31:14.072
<i>Which do you choose?</i>

31:14.172 --> 31:15.206
<i>Brennen: You guys</i>
<i>have been here longer.</i>

31:15.273 --> 31:16.507
<i>I have no idea.</i>

31:16.574 --> 31:17.942
Even though our parents
had a great date tonight,

31:18.042 --> 31:20.578
<i>I think we should put</i>
<i>Karen and Troy</i>

31:20.678 --> 31:22.247
- <i>in a room together.</i>
<i>- I agree.</i>

31:22.347 --> 31:24.782
<i>Because they really</i>
<i>have some good chemistry.</i>

31:24.883 --> 31:27.185
I'm not sure if my mom will go
in that room, though.

31:27.252 --> 31:28.286
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>she would do it</i>

31:28.386 --> 31:29.687
<i>right after a date like that.</i>

31:29.754 --> 31:33.124
<i>I do think Miss Kiki</i>
<i>is ready.</i>

31:33.224 --> 31:36.294
Yeah, Kiki and Mr. Senior
in the room together.

31:36.394 --> 31:37.962
<i>I mean, you can try.</i>

31:38.062 --> 31:41.232
<i>I would be shocked</i>
<i>if my dad did that.</i>

31:41.299 --> 31:42.433
<i>Think your mom</i>
<i>would enjoy the pillow talk?</i>

31:42.533 --> 31:43.568
<i>You think she'd go</i>
<i>for that?</i>

31:43.635 --> 31:44.969
<i>My mom is like,</i>
<i>"I'm here.</i>

31:45.069 --> 31:46.905
<i>I'm open</i>
<i>for any and everything,</i>

31:46.971 --> 31:48.473
<i>whatever</i>
<i>you have to bring."</i>

31:48.573 --> 31:49.641
- <i>She really is.</i>
<i>- Philip and Kiki then.</i>

31:49.741 --> 31:50.608
<i>Troy and Karen's a lock.</i>

31:50.708 --> 31:51.809
<i>So I think that's a lock.</i>

31:51.910 --> 31:53.278
<i>Alex: Okay.</i>

31:55.313 --> 31:56.581
<i>- Hi, guys.</i>
<i>- Hi.</i>

31:56.648 --> 31:58.316
<i>- Hi, Jimmy.</i>
<i>- I just wanted to let you know</i>

31:58.416 --> 32:02.487
that I just got word the romance
suites have opened up.

32:02.587 --> 32:05.957
If you want to forego your
original sleeping arrangements

32:06.057 --> 32:08.159
<i>tonight,</i>
<i>you have access to that.</i>

32:08.259 --> 32:09.727
<i>I appreciate that.</i>
<i>And you know</i>

32:09.794 --> 32:11.396
<i>I don't even know what the heck</i>
<i>none of that means.</i>

32:15.099 --> 32:17.235
<i>Basically,</i>
<i>what he's saying is</i>

32:17.302 --> 32:18.236
<i>that...</i>

32:22.307 --> 32:25.176
<i>He's saying</i>
<i>if we wanted to go,</i>

32:25.276 --> 32:27.178
<i>rather than sleep</i>
<i>in the rooms,</i>

32:27.278 --> 32:29.347
we could sleep together
in this other room,

32:29.447 --> 32:31.649
<i>and it's a really nice,</i>
<i>comfortable bed.</i>

32:31.749 --> 32:33.751
<i>Shit. </i>

32:35.119 --> 32:37.021
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

32:37.121 --> 32:39.524
<i>No, that's not,</i>
<i>you know...</i>

32:39.624 --> 32:41.092
<i>For me,</i>

32:41.159 --> 32:43.027
<i>that's going to take time</i>
<i>to get to...</i>

32:43.127 --> 32:45.196
<i>You know, for me.</i>

32:46.531 --> 32:48.433
<i>Yeah.</i>

32:48.499 --> 32:52.003
<i>You know,</i>
<i>so it's like, yeah.</i>

32:52.103 --> 32:53.705
<i>Can I steal you</i>
<i>for a second?</i>

32:53.805 --> 32:57.709
Wait, is she gonna do it
in the middle of their date?

32:57.809 --> 33:01.546
<i>Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>

33:01.646 --> 33:03.348
<i>Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

33:03.448 --> 33:05.316
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if you've gone out --</i>

33:05.383 --> 33:07.018
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Hey, guys, I'm so sorry.</i>

33:07.118 --> 33:08.686
<i>I know you're looking at me.</i>

33:08.786 --> 33:10.221
<i>I'm getting the energy</i>
<i>that you don't want me here,</i>

33:10.321 --> 33:12.056
<i>and I'll just tell you</i>
<i>some information,</i>

33:12.156 --> 33:13.958
<i>if you can follow me.</i>

33:14.025 --> 33:15.727
<i>I'm getting</i>
<i>some information.</i>

33:15.827 --> 33:16.794
<i>Oh.</i>

33:16.861 --> 33:17.729
<i>Bring it back.</i>

33:17.829 --> 33:18.830
<i>I will.</i>
<i>I'll be back.</i>

33:20.298 --> 33:22.400
<i>Oh, no.</i>

33:22.500 --> 33:26.170
<i>Oh, God, I fucked up.</i>

33:26.237 --> 33:28.573
<i>I -- This is bad, guys.</i>

33:28.673 --> 33:30.408
My mom is so confused
at what's going on right now.

33:30.508 --> 33:33.077
<i>I just found out</i>
<i>from the dating consultants</i>

33:33.177 --> 33:35.480
<i>that the romance suite</i>
<i>opened up,</i>

33:35.546 --> 33:37.582
<i>and you guys</i>
<i>were selected.</i>

33:37.682 --> 33:40.351
<i>If you want to forego</i>
<i>your original</i>

33:40.418 --> 33:41.819
<i>sleeping arrangements</i>
<i>tonight,</i>

33:41.886 --> 33:43.688
<i>you have access</i>
<i>to that room.</i>

33:43.755 --> 33:45.189
<i>So there you go.</i>

33:45.256 --> 33:46.257
<i>Thanks, Jimmy.</i>

33:46.357 --> 33:47.425
<i>Thank you.</i>

33:47.525 --> 33:48.926
<i>I don't --</i>
<i>I don't feel good right now.</i>

33:49.027 --> 33:50.028
<i>I don't feel good at all</i>
<i>right now.</i>

33:50.094 --> 33:51.429
<i>Neither do I.</i>

33:51.529 --> 33:53.564
<i>I think that this is probably</i>
<i>the worst situation</i>

33:53.664 --> 33:54.766
<i>I could have put Troy in.</i>

33:54.866 --> 33:56.667
<i>We shouldn't have</i>
<i>done anything.</i>

33:56.734 --> 33:58.036
<i>Oh!</i>

33:58.102 --> 34:00.004
<i>- That's...</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

34:04.008 --> 34:06.411
<i>And then</i>
<i>she was left alone.</i>

34:06.511 --> 34:07.912
<i>- So, yeah.</i>
<i>- Yep.</i>

34:08.012 --> 34:10.081
<i>Whose idea was it</i>
<i>to have kids meddle</i>

34:10.181 --> 34:11.883
<i>and their parents'</i>
<i>love lives?</i>
