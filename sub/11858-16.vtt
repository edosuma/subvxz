00:05.875 --> 00:09.375
(Pete)
'My name's Pete.
And I'm an alcoholic.'

00:09.458 --> 00:12.709
I used to be the best
stickup man in North Philly.

00:12.792 --> 00:14.291
It's no joke.

00:14.375 --> 00:16.625
Wasn't nothing I couldn't rob.

00:16.709 --> 00:18.792
Let you in on a secret.

00:18.875 --> 00:20.125
It's not the gun.

00:20.208 --> 00:21.583
It's the attitude.

00:22.917 --> 00:24.417
I'd look
in my victims eyes.

00:24.500 --> 00:26.834
Talk to 'em real quiet.

00:26.917 --> 00:29.291
Remind 'em what's on the line
if they wanna play hero.

00:29.375 --> 00:30.875
They'd never have
another Christmas

00:30.959 --> 00:33.417
never hear their wife
laugh again.

00:33.500 --> 00:35.875
Never hold their children.

00:35.959 --> 00:38.291
No problem after that.

00:38.375 --> 00:40.083
Eh, that's not me anymore.

00:42.208 --> 00:45.041
Been inside...12 years.

00:45.125 --> 00:48.125
Sober every one of them.
Wasn't easy.

00:48.208 --> 00:50.667
A lot of time
to worry on my mistakes.

00:52.041 --> 00:53.333
This kept me going.

00:53.417 --> 00:55.458
Letter from my kid
when he was five years old.

00:55.542 --> 00:57.125
Caught the football
for the first time.

00:57.208 --> 00:59.458
Only I wasn't the one
who threw it to him.

00:59.542 --> 01:02.291
All I could do,
write him back.

01:02.375 --> 01:06.083
Which I'd done. Consistent.

01:06.166 --> 01:08.792
I haven't heard back
from in a while.

01:08.875 --> 01:11.000
Don't blame him.
Kid's got a life.

01:11.083 --> 01:12.417
Proud of that.

01:13.709 --> 01:15.792
I'm gettin' out today.

01:15.875 --> 01:17.959
Goin' back to my son.
Got a job lined up.

01:18.041 --> 01:19.834
Gonna do it right this time.

01:22.750 --> 01:25.709
God granted me
a second chance.

01:25.792 --> 01:27.375
I'm takin' it.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.083
Check out the lookie-loo.

02:21.166 --> 02:23.291
Narcs's too busy
congratulating themselves

02:23.375 --> 02:24.875
to clean up for us.

02:25.667 --> 02:26.875
Hey, get lost, buddy.

02:26.959 --> 02:29.333
- This is a crime scene.
- Yeah. Mine.

02:30.959 --> 02:33.333
But you have my permission
to stay, Cagney.

02:35.083 --> 02:38.166
I never heard
that one before, Serpico.

02:38.250 --> 02:39.333
Touche.

02:43.458 --> 02:44.834
Who's the jackass?

02:44.917 --> 02:46.000
Eddie Saccardo.

02:46.083 --> 02:47.500
Runs the narcotics
task force.

02:47.583 --> 02:49.625
- This is his bust.
- Heard of him.

02:49.709 --> 02:51.083
Keyed in on every corner
in Philly.

02:51.166 --> 02:52.291
They say he knows
the crime goin' down

02:52.375 --> 02:53.500
before the crook does.

02:53.583 --> 02:56.166
Yeah, regular
Superman. This guy.

02:56.250 --> 02:57.417
Know the name, Pete Doyle?

02:57.500 --> 02:59.417
Fugitive, pulled his
prints off five guns

02:59.500 --> 03:01.417
with murders to
match
ten years ago.

03:01.500 --> 03:03.542
Could never track
him until now.

03:03.625 --> 03:05.417
- This him?
- No.

03:11.375 --> 03:12.500
This is.

03:59.875 --> 04:01.041
What's with the hand, Manny?

04:01.125 --> 04:03.458
That's my gimmick.
"The man with the
hand."

04:03.542 --> 04:05.125
- Catchy.
- Yeah.

04:05.208 --> 04:07.417
I wanted to get one of those
voodoo guys to shrink it for
me

04:07.500 --> 04:09.083
so I could wear
it
around my neck.

04:09.166 --> 04:12.041
Your boss said I could observe.

04:12.125 --> 04:13.500
That's my drug dealer.

04:13.583 --> 04:15.375
(Rush)
'Where's the rest
of Pete Doyle?'

04:15.458 --> 04:16.834
'Guy that belongs to that hand.'

04:16.917 --> 04:18.583
Assume he owed you money.
Double-crossed you.

04:18.667 --> 04:21.000
- That's why you killed him.
- No, he didn't kill Pete.

04:21.083 --> 04:22.667
- I didn't kill him.
- You found him.

04:22.750 --> 04:25.083
- I found him.
- Where?

04:25.166 --> 04:26.208
Fifth street.
Past Lehigh.

04:26.291 --> 04:28.125
Used to run a corner over there.

04:28.208 --> 04:29.667
I used to run a
corner
back there.

04:29.750 --> 04:31.500
- 'When was this?'
- 'About ten years ago.'

04:31.583 --> 04:33.875
Fall, I think.
It was chilly.

04:33.959 --> 04:36.500
I'm on my way to
work.
There it is.

04:36.583 --> 04:38.583
- The hand?
- The whole body.

04:47.834 --> 04:50.625
Couldn't leave the guy
in the corner. Bad for
business.

04:50.709 --> 04:53.041
Mm, decide the right thing
to do is saw off the hand?

04:53.125 --> 04:55.375
He wasn't
needin'
it no more.

04:55.458 --> 04:58.709
You know how much I made selling
fingerprints off that thing?

04:58.792 --> 04:59.959
What about the gun?

05:00.041 --> 05:01.834
- Keep that, too?
- Hell no.

05:01.917 --> 05:03.500
It had a body on it.

05:03.583 --> 05:05.000
I sold the gun.

05:05.083 --> 05:06.875
Kept the hand.

05:06.959 --> 05:08.250
Duh.

05:09.875 --> 05:11.500
What do we have
on Pete Doyle?

05:11.583 --> 05:14.166
Besides the fact
he's favoring his left hand?

05:15.333 --> 05:17.875
Some kind of stickup man
in North Philly.

05:17.959 --> 05:20.041
Uh, Pistol Pete
was the stickup man.

05:20.125 --> 05:22.375
He had real corner
appeal.
Neighborhood loved him.

05:22.458 --> 05:25.041
Always good for a couple bucks.
Real Jesse James type.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.208
Went away for armed
robbery in '85.

05:27.291 --> 05:29.583
Got pinched busting a check
cashing joint. North
Kensington.

05:29.667 --> 05:31.083
Arresting officer caught
him with the cash

05:31.166 --> 05:32.667
and a .44 Smith and Wesson.

05:32.750 --> 05:35.583
- 'Pete's weapon of choice.'
- And a 20 year sentence.

05:35.667 --> 05:38.250
Served 12.
Good behavior.

05:38.333 --> 05:42.667
- You memorize his rap sheet?
- No, we used to date.

05:42.750 --> 05:44.333
So, Pete gets out
September '97.

05:44.417 --> 05:45.792
'Ends up dead
a few weeks later.'

05:45.875 --> 05:47.500
He might have
pissed
someone off.

05:47.583 --> 05:49.875
Says here he had a
partner.
Tommy Connell.

05:49.959 --> 05:51.083
Career jag-off.

05:51.166 --> 05:52.500
You can find him
at the Tap House.

05:52.583 --> 05:54.667
Polluting the same
stool for 20 years.

05:54.750 --> 05:57.500
Pete also had
an ex, Jules Murphy.

05:57.583 --> 06:00.750
Used to be a party girl.
Pete knocked her up.

06:00.834 --> 06:02.458
Then he had the nerve
to get put away.

06:02.542 --> 06:03.875
Hear she holds a grudge.
What's the matter?

06:03.959 --> 06:05.375
It's not in your file?

06:07.333 --> 06:09.500
I'll pick up Tommy Connell.

06:09.583 --> 06:11.458
Guess I'll pay
the ex a visit.

06:21.667 --> 06:23.208
Why are you
still here?

06:23.291 --> 06:25.291
Waiting to take possession
of my drug dealer.

06:25.375 --> 06:27.291
Well, we'll call
you
when we're done.

06:34.125 --> 06:37.500
Been waiting for the day you'd
arrive, tell me Pete's dead.

06:38.709 --> 06:41.625
Pete did a number on you, Jules.

06:41.709 --> 06:44.208
Left you high and dry
with a kid to boot.

06:44.291 --> 06:46.583
You won't get
an argument out of me.

06:46.667 --> 06:48.959
But I didn't kill him.

06:49.041 --> 06:51.458
- He was my first love.
- Real sweet.

06:51.542 --> 06:54.291
Yeah, he could be. Charming,
too. Part of him, at least.

06:54.375 --> 06:56.291
The other part didn't care
about no one or nothing.

06:56.375 --> 06:58.083
Not even your kid? Uh.

06:59.166 --> 07:00.875
Petey Jr.

07:00.959 --> 07:04.667
Way he saw it, family got
<i>career.</i>

07:05.583 --> 07:07.000
But that kid
adored the man.

07:07.083 --> 07:09.166
Must have been tough
when Pete went away.

07:09.250 --> 07:11.000
I was left
to fend for myself.

07:11.083 --> 07:12.875
Lot of resentment there.

07:12.959 --> 07:15.166
I was too busy raising my boy.

07:16.083 --> 07:18.000
That's when we got together.

07:18.083 --> 07:19.667
Tried to make a good
home for Petey.

07:19.750 --> 07:21.208
Yeah. And we did.

07:22.291 --> 07:24.917
So...Pete comes back..

07:25.000 --> 07:27.250
...discovers his son's
got a new dad.

07:27.333 --> 07:29.542
The nerve,
don't see him for 12 years.

07:29.625 --> 07:33.667
An hour after he's released,
he's on our doorstep.

07:33.750 --> 07:36.542
Girard to north sixth,
cut over on spring.

07:37.542 --> 07:38.583
No.

07:38.667 --> 07:41.208
He told me you
know this town.

07:41.291 --> 07:43.291
'No, you're going
to be blocked up.'

07:43.375 --> 07:44.542
See you readin'
that book.

07:44.625 --> 07:46.291
'Like it got the answers
to everything.'

07:46.375 --> 07:48.834
I used to read a lot
of those crime books.

07:48.917 --> 07:50.208
Pass the time.

07:51.458 --> 07:54.083
You're him, aren't you?
My dad.

07:55.417 --> 07:56.500
Yeah.

07:58.250 --> 07:59.458
You were in jail.

07:59.542 --> 08:00.667
Not anymore.

08:00.750 --> 08:01.917
What? You escape?

08:02.000 --> 08:03.375
No.

08:03.458 --> 08:04.917
Done my time.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.041
I'm free.

08:10.500 --> 08:12.250
Got it when I was your age.

08:12.333 --> 08:14.542
My declaration of independence.

08:15.625 --> 08:17.333
You got any tattoos?

08:19.542 --> 08:21.667
That was a joke.

08:24.875 --> 08:27.375
I got you somethin'.

08:27.458 --> 08:29.083
Your favorite.

08:29.166 --> 08:32.041
Told me about it
in one of your letters.

08:35.250 --> 08:38.083
I was five.
I play soccer now.

08:40.875 --> 08:43.667
I didn't know.

08:45.834 --> 08:47.041
It's okay.

08:47.125 --> 08:48.917
I've had a lot a time to think.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.959
I'm not standin' here
expectin' the world to stop

08:51.041 --> 08:53.000
now I'm back.
You got a life.

08:53.083 --> 08:54.750
Only hope maybe
I can be a part of it

08:54.834 --> 08:56.834
if that's okay with you.

09:00.959 --> 09:03.333
Get in the house, Petey.

09:08.208 --> 09:09.417
Jules.

09:11.542 --> 09:13.667
You look great.

09:13.750 --> 09:15.208
I know, you're pissed.

09:15.291 --> 09:16.792
Don't worry.

09:16.875 --> 09:18.750
I've dried up inside.
Got my GED.

09:18.834 --> 09:20.917
I'm committed to doin'
right by you and Petey.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.792
You think you can just drop by?

09:22.875 --> 09:24.792
Not even the courtesy
to let us know?

09:24.875 --> 09:27.291
I meant to. I kept
tryin'
to put pen to paper.

09:27.375 --> 09:29.000
Explain it all. Nothin' came.

09:31.709 --> 09:35.166
But I told Petey.
Last couple letters.

09:35.250 --> 09:37.667
Petey doesn't get your letters.

09:37.750 --> 09:40.250
I kinda figured.

09:46.291 --> 09:47.667
Leave us be, Pete.

09:47.750 --> 09:49.417
Honestly, for the sake
of the boy, it'd be better

09:49.500 --> 09:52.041
if you're still in jail.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.458
Never came back after that.

10:00.542 --> 10:03.166
Only good thing he did,
staying away.

10:03.250 --> 10:05.709
Petey Jr. ever go
looking for his dad?

10:05.792 --> 10:07.500
Seek out the hero?

10:07.583 --> 10:09.166
Kept his eye
on the prize.

10:09.250 --> 10:11.166
College, a real job.

10:11.250 --> 10:13.250
(Jules)
'Never mentioned
Pete again.'

10:18.250 --> 10:20.750
(Jeffries)
'Tommy Connell,
Pete Doyle's wingman.'

10:20.834 --> 10:23.417
You're a real
sweetheart, Tommy.

10:23.500 --> 10:25.834
Been reading your record.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.542
You can read?

10:27.625 --> 10:30.792
Ooh. Laugh riot.

10:30.875 --> 10:34.208
You and Pete pulled some
...crazy jobs back in the day.

10:34.291 --> 10:37.125
Oh, the nostalgia file.

10:37.208 --> 10:39.834
That's 20 years ago.
Don't got nothing recent?

10:39.917 --> 10:42.208
What about Pete Doyle's murder?

10:42.291 --> 10:44.625
I heard about that.
It's a damn shame.

10:44.709 --> 10:47.542
You can do better
than that, Tommy.

10:47.625 --> 10:49.250
I took it as a blow.

10:49.333 --> 10:51.041
We was like brothers,
me and Pete.

10:51.125 --> 10:54.667
He went down hard for that
check-cashing heist back in
'85.

10:54.750 --> 10:56.500
We know you were the second man.

10:56.583 --> 10:58.917
Could've got five years
had he gave you up.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.500
Did 12 instead.

11:00.583 --> 11:02.000
Real stand-up guy.

11:02.083 --> 11:04.709
So maybe Pete starts
thinking you owe him.

11:04.792 --> 11:08.083
You figure it's
easier
to clear the books.

11:08.166 --> 11:12.667
If what you were saying
was true and I admit
nothing..

11:12.750 --> 11:13.917
...I'd have been grateful.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.917
One way of looking at it.
Other way.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.250
A debt like that becomes
a burden hanging over your
head.

11:18.333 --> 11:19.583
Shows what you know.

11:19.667 --> 11:22.083
I did everything I could
to help when he got out

11:22.166 --> 11:23.583
but he wouldn't accept.

11:23.667 --> 11:26.959
This was a different Pete
Doyle
than the one I knew.

11:32.875 --> 11:34.083
I've been calling and calling.

11:34.166 --> 11:35.792
Your cousin
was my counselor inside.

11:35.875 --> 11:37.458
Said you hired guys like me.

11:37.542 --> 11:38.458
Used to.

11:38.542 --> 11:39.959
I got burned too many times.

11:40.041 --> 11:41.750
Not by me.
I'm a man of my
word.

11:41.834 --> 11:44.083
I'll work straight
commission.
I got an aptitude.

11:44.166 --> 11:45.625
It's win-win.

11:45.709 --> 11:46.875
All I want's a chance.

11:46.959 --> 11:49.542
I don't have any
openings. Sorry.

11:49.625 --> 11:51.959
Please, don't come here anymore.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.834
Tough break.
But what'd you
expect?

12:00.667 --> 12:02.125
- I got other options.
- Whoa!

12:02.208 --> 12:04.834
That's the "hello"
I get 12 years
later?

12:06.333 --> 12:08.041
I got to hear
on the street you're
out?

12:08.125 --> 12:10.125
- Sorry.
- Forget it.

12:10.208 --> 12:12.417
Let's get a drink.

12:12.500 --> 12:13.959
Can't. Looking for a job.

12:14.041 --> 12:17.041
I'm crewing up for a piece
of work if you're interested.

12:17.125 --> 12:18.500
Real job, Tommy.

12:18.583 --> 12:20.291
"Real job," huh?

12:20.375 --> 12:21.542
Let's see.

12:21.625 --> 12:23.625
"Busboy."

12:23.709 --> 12:25.500
"Car wash."

12:25.583 --> 12:27.458
"Janitor?"

12:27.542 --> 12:28.792
This ain't
what you were meant for.

12:28.875 --> 12:31.375
Cleaning some mope's toilet.

12:31.458 --> 12:33.500
This isn't you,
Pistol Pete.

12:34.917 --> 12:36.583
Ain't that guy no more.

12:37.875 --> 12:40.000
I've been spending some time
with that kid of yours.

12:40.083 --> 12:42.375
Comes by the place.
We talk about the old days.

12:42.458 --> 12:43.583
He loves those stories.

12:43.667 --> 12:46.667
I don't want you talking to
him.
Serious.

12:46.750 --> 12:49.333
He's a good kid.
You stay the hell
away.

12:51.875 --> 12:53.417
Catch you next time.

12:53.500 --> 12:54.625
But I ain't worried.

12:54.709 --> 12:56.959
I know the real
Pete Doyle's in there.

12:57.041 --> 12:59.875
You have him come see me
when he's ready.

12:59.959 --> 13:02.500
(Vera)
'Expect us to believe
he went straight?'

13:02.583 --> 13:03.834
As a frickin' arrow.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.792
Wanted a regular job.

13:05.875 --> 13:07.875
Regular life.

13:07.959 --> 13:11.166
Didn't matter.
Got him killed anyway.

13:11.250 --> 13:13.291
Pete Doyle checked
in weekly with his PO

13:13.375 --> 13:15.625
never missed curfew,
tested clean for drugs.

13:15.709 --> 13:18.542
Guy was making a go of it.
Got to respect the effort.

13:18.625 --> 13:20.792
Just found a report
on the arrest of Peter Doyle

13:20.875 --> 13:23.041
back in September '97.

13:23.125 --> 13:24.458
Weapons charge.

13:24.542 --> 13:26.208
So much for regular life.

13:26.291 --> 13:29.333
Oh, not the father,
the son. Petey Jr.

13:29.417 --> 13:31.417
Not the choirboy
his mother said.

13:31.500 --> 13:35.000
Picked up
at St. Alvin's Prep, with a
gun.

13:35.083 --> 13:36.542
.44 Smith and Wesson.

13:36.625 --> 13:38.125
Pete's weapon of choice.

13:38.208 --> 13:40.792
Same caliber we
think killed him, too.

13:40.875 --> 13:42.542
Like father, like son.

13:48.250 --> 13:49.667
(Vera)
'I don't buy this Pistol
Pete
turning over a new leaf.'

13:49.750 --> 13:51.208
(Valens)
That's 'cause you're cynical.

13:51.291 --> 13:53.000
It's like that old
parable
the tiger and the
mouse.

13:53.083 --> 13:54.417
Mouse gets eaten,
even though

13:54.500 --> 13:56.250
he pulls the thorn
out,
it's in his nature.

13:56.333 --> 13:58.125
No, you mean the spider
and the frog.

13:58.208 --> 14:00.417
Frog gets bitten after he
takes
the spider across the river.

14:00.500 --> 14:01.917
No, it's the mongoose
and the scorpion.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.792
Hey guys, I don't
care what it is.

14:03.875 --> 14:06.166
There's no way a hard con
like this guy goes legit.

14:06.250 --> 14:07.583
What about the son?

14:07.667 --> 14:09.917
The apple doesn't
fall
far from the tree.

14:17.583 --> 14:19.750
Yeah, a regular Al Capone.

14:19.834 --> 14:22.750
Wanna tell us about the gun
you brought to school?

14:22.834 --> 14:25.875
Seriously? That was,
that was years ago.

14:25.959 --> 14:27.250
It's a felony.

14:27.333 --> 14:28.625
Yeah, but I pleaded
to a misdemeanor

14:28.709 --> 14:30.333
and my record
was supposed to be sealed.

14:30.417 --> 14:32.625
It turns out your father was
murdered around the same time.

14:32.709 --> 14:35.041
Same type of gun, too.

14:35.125 --> 14:39.542
Uh, P-Pete Doyle wasn't
any kind of father to me.

14:39.625 --> 14:41.583
See, things like
that
make me think

14:41.667 --> 14:43.792
you might've
gone after
him.

14:43.875 --> 14:45.583
Lot of anger, frustration.

14:45.667 --> 14:47.417
Yeah, I was angry.

14:47.500 --> 14:49.500
I was the kid whose
dad was locked away.

14:49.583 --> 14:51.291
That was my identity.

14:51.375 --> 14:53.750
Pistol Pete's son.

14:53.834 --> 14:56.583
I brought the gun to school
showed everyone they were right

14:56.667 --> 14:59.875
got arrested and
expelled.
Not my happiest time.

14:59.959 --> 15:02.583
Understandable,
way he abandoned you.

15:03.750 --> 15:06.000
I'd write him letters.

15:07.166 --> 15:09.125
Like he cared.

15:09.208 --> 15:12.959
I was convinced
that he would break
out..

15:13.041 --> 15:14.792
...and take me away.

15:18.250 --> 15:21.083
- Ridiculous, huh?
- When he finally did show up?

15:21.166 --> 15:23.542
He wasn't any kind of legend.

15:23.625 --> 15:26.375
(Rush)
'Mom said you only
saw him one time.'

15:26.458 --> 15:28.417
Yeah, once he was back.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.375
Knowing he was there.

15:30.458 --> 15:32.667
I couldn't help
but go looking for him.

15:53.208 --> 15:55.834
Your mom know you're here?

15:55.917 --> 15:58.375
- You shouldn't disobey her.
- I know.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.709
You're my dad.
I should get a
say.

16:04.458 --> 16:08.542
Wow, this is where you beat
up
that group of marines.

16:08.625 --> 16:10.375
Tommy told me the story.

16:10.458 --> 16:12.834
You shouldn't put too much
stock in his version.

16:12.917 --> 16:14.166
It was one guy.

16:18.083 --> 16:19.208
You need to get
out of here.

16:19.291 --> 16:20.333
They got rules about underage.

16:22.333 --> 16:24.250
You saved them.

16:24.333 --> 16:25.542
The letters I sent.

16:25.625 --> 16:27.333
You kept them.

16:27.417 --> 16:28.750
Every one.

16:28.834 --> 16:29.959
Kept me alive in there.

16:30.041 --> 16:33.208
So how come you
never wrote back?

16:33.291 --> 16:35.000
(male #1)
'Hey, mop boy!'

16:40.083 --> 16:41.542
Go home, Petey.

16:49.083 --> 16:51.834
Well, if it ain't Pistol Pete.

16:51.917 --> 16:54.250
'I heard you were out.'

16:54.333 --> 16:55.667
You remember me?

16:55.750 --> 16:57.542
Officer O'Leary.

16:57.625 --> 17:00.291
'Guy who put your
worthless ass away.'

17:03.333 --> 17:06.125
Hey, watch the shoes.

17:06.208 --> 17:07.542
My good pair.

17:08.792 --> 17:10.500
'Nice gig you got here.'

17:12.000 --> 17:14.500
'Sure you working
some scheme on the side.'

17:15.917 --> 17:17.750
I'm out of the game.

17:21.917 --> 17:24.542
I told you to watch
the damn shoes.

17:25.792 --> 17:26.834
Dad?

17:27.875 --> 17:29.333
Well, hell, Pete.

17:29.417 --> 17:31.625
You got a son.

17:31.709 --> 17:33.291
Little thug in training.

17:33.375 --> 17:34.625
It's in the blood, right?

17:34.709 --> 17:36.125
Get out of here, Petey. Go.

17:36.208 --> 17:37.750
'Yeah, run along, Petey.'

17:37.834 --> 17:39.834
Sure I'll be
locking
you up real soon.

17:39.917 --> 17:41.959
Give you one of my famous
tours of the city.

17:42.041 --> 17:43.333
Remember those, Pete?

17:43.417 --> 17:46.709
Think the kid will
take
to it like you did?

17:46.792 --> 17:48.667
Do it. I'm begging you.

18:00.625 --> 18:02.208
You'll slip up.

18:02.291 --> 18:04.166
And when you do,
I'll be there.

18:04.250 --> 18:07.208
And we'll settle this.

18:25.750 --> 18:28.458
The way he just took it.

18:28.542 --> 18:30.750
Kept cleaning up
after that jerk.

18:31.625 --> 18:33.000
It was humiliating.

18:33.083 --> 18:35.834
Your pop was supposed
to be larger than life

18:35.917 --> 18:37.500
but he was just a man.

18:37.583 --> 18:40.000
No, he was a coward.

18:40.083 --> 18:41.375
And a liar.

18:42.083 --> 18:44.125
Best thing he ever did

18:44.208 --> 18:45.917
disappearing from my life.

18:55.959 --> 18:57.250
How's retirement
treating you, Dan?

18:57.333 --> 18:59.041
Yeah, living a dream, John.

18:59.125 --> 19:01.917
Only have to work two
jobs
to cover my alimony.

19:03.667 --> 19:05.375
But that's not why I'm here.

19:05.458 --> 19:06.625
It's about Pete Doyle.

19:06.709 --> 19:08.625
Detective Miller.

19:08.709 --> 19:10.375
I heard you
found his
hand.

19:10.458 --> 19:13.083
I only wish I was
there
to see it come off.

19:13.166 --> 19:14.291
Kind of harsh.

19:14.375 --> 19:17.041
You know how Pistol Pete
got his name, sugar?

19:17.125 --> 19:19.041
His first robbery.

19:19.125 --> 19:20.291
Liquor store.

19:20.375 --> 19:22.041
He pistol-whips the salesman.

19:22.125 --> 19:23.375
Cracked his head open.

19:23.458 --> 19:26.458
Guy's in a coma for a month.
Pete was 15.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.583
He'd kill you
as much as look at you.

19:29.667 --> 19:31.250
Maybe you did it first?

19:31.333 --> 19:34.667
You threatened Pete Doyle
in a bar full of customers.

19:34.750 --> 19:38.959
I told him I was waiting
for him to slip up. Which I
was.

19:39.041 --> 19:41.041
John, tell her
what it was like

19:41.125 --> 19:43.625
when cops actually
did police work.

19:43.709 --> 19:46.667
Like your famous tour of the
city, take 'em out to the
river

19:46.750 --> 19:48.417
show 'em the business
end of your nightstick.

19:48.500 --> 19:50.917
You know, I'm not gonna
explain myself.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
I had a job.
I did it good.

19:53.083 --> 19:55.750
Way we heard it, it was
personal between you and Pete.

19:55.834 --> 19:57.750
Yeah. I took it personal.

19:57.834 --> 19:59.500
Every score he made.

19:59.583 --> 20:02.917
Every time he flashed a roll
of dirty money in a bar.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.709
That smug grin on his face.
But I didn't want to kill
him.

20:06.792 --> 20:08.709
- What did you want?
- 'Put him where he belonged.'

20:08.792 --> 20:10.250
Prison.

20:10.333 --> 20:11.792
I knew I'd get my chance.

20:11.875 --> 20:14.750
He was back to his
old ways in no time.

20:22.959 --> 20:24.333
Thanks for this, I guess.

20:26.834 --> 20:30.458
I've been...going to these
meetings, one form or another

20:30.542 --> 20:32.834
'for years,
mostly in the joint.'

20:32.917 --> 20:35.041
I'm out now a few weeks.

20:35.125 --> 20:36.625
Yeah.

20:36.709 --> 20:38.917
Working the program
like they tell you.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.625
"Make amends."

20:40.709 --> 20:41.959
Found a higher power.

20:42.041 --> 20:44.250
Tried to change
from what I used to be.

20:44.333 --> 20:47.125
Problem is, nothing
changed with me.

20:47.208 --> 20:49.959
The way you're looking
at me now. I can see it.

20:50.041 --> 20:51.917
'That suspicion
that I might snap.'

20:55.458 --> 20:56.834
I can live with it.

21:00.166 --> 21:01.625
But my son..

21:03.375 --> 21:04.709
...the disappointment he has

21:04.792 --> 21:07.375
watching me humiliate
myself for nothing.

21:10.417 --> 21:12.625
How's a man supposed
to live with that?

21:17.917 --> 21:20.625
Well, maybe I should
just give in?

21:20.709 --> 21:22.917
Accept what I am,
bad through and through?

21:29.291 --> 21:32.625
At this point...I don't see
why the hell I shouldn't.

21:36.041 --> 21:38.083
That's all I got.

21:44.208 --> 21:45.291
You did good.

21:48.083 --> 21:49.709
(Miller)
'You should have
locked him up.'

21:49.792 --> 21:52.083
'Parolee strapped
like that.'

21:52.166 --> 21:54.500
I didn't want him
on a gun charge.

21:56.291 --> 21:58.166
Word on the street was
that, uh..

21:58.250 --> 22:00.959
...Pete and Tommy
had a big score.

22:01.041 --> 22:04.083
They were ridin' around
in a stolen car. Gearing it
up.

22:04.166 --> 22:05.625
I was gonna
catch
'em in the act.

22:05.709 --> 22:08.125
But it never happened.

22:08.208 --> 22:11.250
Pete fell off the face
of the planet.

22:11.333 --> 22:13.959
I never figured out
what they were plannin'

22:14.041 --> 22:15.250
but one thing I knew..

22:15.333 --> 22:17.291
Pistol Pete was back
in business.

22:30.792 --> 22:32.000
Still in there?

22:32.083 --> 22:34.291
Will hasn't even
come
out to take a pee.

22:34.375 --> 22:36.583
We've been goin' at this
guy eight hours.

22:43.125 --> 22:45.000
- Any luck?
- 'Just lawyered up.'

22:45.083 --> 22:47.458
Sending him down to
wait
for his mouthpiece.

22:53.792 --> 22:55.417
What's this?

22:55.500 --> 22:57.291
Bunks barbecue.

22:57.375 --> 23:00.125
Best in Philly, just a
little
thank you for being

23:00.208 --> 23:03.417
so cooperative in releasing
my prisoner to me.

23:04.709 --> 23:07.125
Oh, it's official,
Saccardo.

23:07.208 --> 23:09.750
You're goin' in my will.

23:09.834 --> 23:12.375
Hmm. What a guy.

23:14.083 --> 23:15.959
Hey, admit it.

23:16.041 --> 23:17.333
'You missed me.'

23:21.208 --> 23:22.458
Hey!

23:24.959 --> 23:26.500
Tommy!

23:27.542 --> 23:29.250
'Been a while.'

23:29.333 --> 23:31.875
How's your sister?

23:31.959 --> 23:33.875
Hey, she still, uh,
cocktailing over

23:33.959 --> 23:36.542
at the Hi Life?

23:36.625 --> 23:38.375
- 'Yeah.'
- Don't worry.

23:38.458 --> 23:39.834
Lawyer's on the way.

23:39.917 --> 23:42.291
But what I hear, been
hitting the bottle again.

23:42.375 --> 23:45.375
Don't know how confident
I'd be if I was you, Tom.

23:47.166 --> 23:48.542
Cat got your tongue?

23:50.625 --> 23:53.667
You're not still mad
about Phil the Pill?

23:53.750 --> 23:55.834
'It was an honest
misunderstanding.'

23:55.917 --> 23:58.208
I mean,
accidents happen, right?

23:59.834 --> 24:02.333
Every day.

24:02.417 --> 24:05.500
Hey, detective?
Get him out of here.

24:05.583 --> 24:06.917
Now you hurt my feelings.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.792
- Please.
- Excuse me.

24:14.250 --> 24:15.500
That ain't right,
bringin' him here.

24:15.583 --> 24:17.000
You shouldn't do that to a guy.

24:17.083 --> 24:19.417
Tell me about Pete, Tommy. You
two were planning a robbery.

24:19.500 --> 24:20.542
I want to make a deal first.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.208
All we care about
is Pete's murder.

24:22.291 --> 24:24.041
Complete immunity
then in writing.

24:24.125 --> 24:27.333
I could bring Saccardo back in
to discuss that with you.

24:28.041 --> 24:30.375
Alright. Point made.

24:31.375 --> 24:33.291
I knew it had to
be the right job

24:33.375 --> 24:34.792
to get Pete back to work.

24:34.875 --> 24:37.375
Something...choice.

24:37.458 --> 24:39.208
Still took a
lot
of convincing

24:39.291 --> 24:41.000
but he changed his mind.

24:41.083 --> 24:43.083
Why'd he finally give in?

24:43.166 --> 24:44.709
I had an ace in the hole.

24:51.291 --> 24:55.959
I'm ain't gonna lie to
you.
This is ambitious.

24:56.041 --> 24:59.041
It's probably
the biggest score, we ever
had.

24:59.125 --> 25:00.583
We're talkin' a bank?

25:00.667 --> 25:03.083
All will be
revealed
in due course.

25:03.166 --> 25:05.542
- Drink your beer.
- I'm on the wagon.

25:08.875 --> 25:10.500
I figure we go in heavy.

25:10.583 --> 25:12.875
Shotguns blazing,
kneecap one of the guards.

25:12.959 --> 25:14.417
Show 'em we
mean business.

25:14.500 --> 25:17.458
And if the guy dies,
that's felony murder.

25:17.542 --> 25:19.000
Guaranteed life.

25:19.083 --> 25:20.917
I don't intend to get caught.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.542
I didn't, either.

25:24.250 --> 25:25.792
You got to understand
these guards.

25:25.875 --> 25:28.750
Whatever they're protecting
doesn't belong to them.

25:28.834 --> 25:30.709
End of the day,
they wanna go home.

25:30.792 --> 25:34.792
Let 'em know there's no
profit for dead heroes.

25:36.458 --> 25:37.834
Damn!

25:37.917 --> 25:39.625
My man is back.

25:41.500 --> 25:43.750
(Pete)
'Now will you tell me
what the score is?'

25:43.834 --> 25:48.291
Hmm. Why don't you ask
the brains of the
operation?

25:53.208 --> 25:55.750
You should see
the look on your
face.

25:55.834 --> 25:58.792
- You put him up to it?
- It was my idea.

25:58.875 --> 26:00.417
Kid worked
the whole thing
out.

26:00.500 --> 26:02.291
Just like his old man.

26:05.417 --> 26:08.500
Hmm? What are you thinking?

26:08.583 --> 26:10.000
You're better than this.

26:10.083 --> 26:11.750
You're smart.
You got a future.

26:11.834 --> 26:13.375
- As what? A bus driver?
- Yeah.

26:13.458 --> 26:14.458
An office worker?

26:14.542 --> 26:16.291
- Yeah.
- I don't want that.

26:16.375 --> 26:19.166
I want this,
with or without
you.

26:21.166 --> 26:22.792
Guess that's settled then.

26:22.875 --> 26:25.959
Let's have a drink, hmm?

26:26.041 --> 26:27.792
'To the future.'

26:41.917 --> 26:44.834
Pete let his 15-year-old son
participate in an armed
robbery?

26:44.917 --> 26:47.542
Wasn't any older
when his cherry
broke.

26:47.625 --> 26:49.875
What was the score, Tommy?

26:49.959 --> 26:52.166
Hey, you don't think
junior did his dad?

26:52.250 --> 26:53.333
That'd be messed up.

26:53.417 --> 26:55.667
What was the score?

26:55.750 --> 26:59.542
Gosh, detective,
it was so long
ago..

27:02.291 --> 27:04.041
Lawyer's here.

27:15.959 --> 27:18.709
Don't talk to a suspect
of mine without asking again.

27:18.792 --> 27:20.041
He gave you what
you wanted didn't he?

27:20.125 --> 27:21.250
Until his
lawyer
showed up.

27:21.333 --> 27:24.041
I'm not the one
who called him.

27:24.125 --> 27:26.166
- This is my desk.
- My bad.

27:27.625 --> 27:28.834
The guy you mentioned in there

27:28.917 --> 27:30.709
uh, who freaked Tommy out.

27:30.792 --> 27:32.834
Phil the Pill?
Who is he?

27:32.917 --> 27:34.875
Friend of Tommy's
from the block.

27:34.959 --> 27:37.000
Kind of famous for his bad luck.

27:37.083 --> 27:38.667
Arrested him one time
up on this roof.

27:38.750 --> 27:42.208
Guy tried to run from me,
fell off, crippled himself.

27:42.291 --> 27:43.834
- Hmm.
- Like I said, bad luck.

27:43.917 --> 27:46.208
He fell off?

27:46.291 --> 27:47.625
That's how the story goes.

27:51.792 --> 27:53.542
You got to try these ribs.

28:04.500 --> 28:05.959
You lied to us, Petey.

28:06.041 --> 28:07.500
Said you never
saw your father

28:07.583 --> 28:10.041
after that
time
at the bar.

28:10.125 --> 28:12.250
- I didn't.
- Lying again.

28:12.333 --> 28:15.000
We know why you brought
the gun to school.

28:15.083 --> 28:16.667
Wasn't to prove a point.

28:16.750 --> 28:17.750
For armed robbery.

28:17.834 --> 28:19.709
The family business.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.500
Talked to Tommy, huh?

28:23.583 --> 28:27.000
Made you out to be some
kind
of criminal mastermind.

28:27.083 --> 28:29.083
Ready to put his
hand
on the Bible.

28:29.166 --> 28:30.583
Say you're the triggerman.

28:30.667 --> 28:32.792
We're givin' you a chance
to get out

28:32.875 --> 28:34.625
in front of this thing.

28:34.709 --> 28:36.125
The day of the robbery..

28:37.875 --> 28:39.709
...I was with Pete in the car.

28:39.792 --> 28:41.667
It's alright, Petey.

28:41.750 --> 28:44.291
You idolized your father.
Wanted to be him.

28:44.375 --> 28:46.291
You brought him the score.

28:46.375 --> 28:48.291
Figured you'd earned
your right at the table

28:48.375 --> 28:50.709
'your father's respect,
but something went wrong.'

28:50.792 --> 28:53.250
Something did, Petey,
'cause he ended up dead.

28:53.333 --> 28:56.750
I wasn't looking
...for his respect.

28:56.834 --> 28:59.959
I was lookin'
for a reason to respect him.

29:00.041 --> 29:01.959
'He was pathetic.'

29:02.041 --> 29:03.750
Cleaning up after drunks.

29:03.834 --> 29:05.417
Getting pushed around.

29:05.500 --> 29:07.959
I wanted him to be the man

29:08.041 --> 29:10.333
that I had heard
about growing up.

29:13.083 --> 29:14.667
I wanted to believe.

29:24.875 --> 29:26.000
'Give me that.'

29:35.959 --> 29:37.208
Ready to use it?

29:38.375 --> 29:39.709
Yeah.

29:42.500 --> 29:45.041
'Point it at me.
Do it.'

29:45.917 --> 29:47.166
Like this?

29:50.792 --> 29:52.083
Look me in the eye now.

29:52.166 --> 29:53.667
Show me you're willing
to go all the way

29:53.750 --> 29:56.583
squeeze that trigger, put my
brains on the windshield.

29:56.667 --> 29:58.458
I'm a man. I can do it.

30:08.834 --> 30:10.542
You think you're tough?

30:10.625 --> 30:13.083
Some kind of hard man, 'cause
you gave us a street address?

30:13.166 --> 30:15.834
- Wrote down a time?
- Please stop.

30:15.917 --> 30:17.083
It means nothing.

30:17.166 --> 30:19.583
- You mean nothing.
- Dad.

30:19.667 --> 30:21.458
Want to know why
I never wrote you
letters?

30:21.542 --> 30:23.417
'Cause you weren't
worth the effort.

30:23.500 --> 30:25.792
You have zero to offer.

30:25.875 --> 30:27.583
Get out of here!

30:34.709 --> 30:37.875
Truck's right on time.
What's up with the kid?

30:39.333 --> 30:41.208
Forget about him.

30:41.291 --> 30:42.500
Let's do this.

30:55.125 --> 30:57.250
Your stepdad drove
an armored car?

30:57.333 --> 30:58.583
I told Pete everything.

30:58.667 --> 31:01.750
I told him the, uh,
the delivery route

31:01.834 --> 31:04.917
how the guards operated,
how much money there was.

31:06.458 --> 31:08.875
I got...screwed.

31:08.959 --> 31:10.792
You consider
what would have happened

31:10.875 --> 31:12.834
if he hadn't cut you out?

31:14.333 --> 31:16.625
What happened to the heist?

31:16.709 --> 31:17.959
It fell apart.

31:18.041 --> 31:19.291
Bernie called the cops.

31:19.375 --> 31:22.083
Did he know who was robbing him?

31:25.834 --> 31:30.792
A few weeks after her
stepson's
ex-con dad shows up..

31:30.875 --> 31:33.625
Bernie's armored
car
gets hit.

31:33.709 --> 31:35.166
Bernie's a smart guy.

31:35.250 --> 31:39.083
Must have considered
Pistol Pete Doyle was
involved.

31:39.166 --> 31:41.750
Funny how good ol'
Bernie
never mentioned that.

31:53.625 --> 31:56.125
You're a modest
guy, Bernie.

31:56.208 --> 31:58.250
Way you dress..

31:58.333 --> 31:59.917
...your attitude.

32:01.542 --> 32:03.667
Unassuming.

32:03.750 --> 32:06.291
I was in your house
the other day.

32:06.375 --> 32:09.125
Had no idea I was sitting
across from a hero.

32:09.208 --> 32:13.208
Single-handedly thwarted
the robbery of your armored
car.

32:13.291 --> 32:14.500
I don't talk about it.

32:14.583 --> 32:16.041
Well, it was brave.

32:16.125 --> 32:18.083
Fighting off two masked gunmen.

32:18.166 --> 32:19.750
Yeah, got a commendation
from the company.

32:19.834 --> 32:21.083
Even offered you a reward.

32:21.166 --> 32:22.333
You turned them down.

32:22.417 --> 32:24.166
Didn't think it was right.

32:24.250 --> 32:26.083
Gettin' extra for doing my job.

32:26.166 --> 32:28.000
Oh.

32:28.083 --> 32:29.542
Two weeks later, you quit.

32:29.625 --> 32:31.417
Yeah. Was it the danger?

32:31.500 --> 32:33.333
Comin' so close to dyin'?

32:33.417 --> 32:35.917
Or was it guilt, Bernie,
for what happened that day

32:36.000 --> 32:37.875
with Pete and Petey Jr.?

32:39.667 --> 32:42.709
Put this on me all you want.
Leave Petey Jr. out.

32:42.792 --> 32:44.208
You knew who
was robbing you.

32:44.291 --> 32:46.875
That Petey Jr. must
have
helped set it up.

32:46.959 --> 32:49.709
Question is
why you never told.

32:49.792 --> 32:51.709
I was looking out for the boy.

32:53.166 --> 32:55.041
I could see the change in
him
when his dad came back.

32:55.125 --> 32:57.041
He was spinning in place.

32:57.125 --> 32:58.542
You raised him
like your own.

32:58.625 --> 33:01.875
Tried to teach him right
from wrong, best I could.

33:03.625 --> 33:04.917
To be decent.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.917
And Pete, he was
the wrong kind of influence.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.250
Petey Jr. ate it up.

33:10.333 --> 33:11.709
Adored that man.

33:11.792 --> 33:13.750
Romanticized him.

33:13.834 --> 33:15.208
I had to do somethin'.

33:15.291 --> 33:18.000
Did you chase after
him, take his gun?

33:18.083 --> 33:19.625
Shoot him down
for Petey Jr.'s sake?

33:19.709 --> 33:22.709
I would have
if it had come to
that.

33:24.041 --> 33:25.458
But it played out different.

33:35.709 --> 33:37.542
All clear.

33:51.500 --> 33:52.917
Give me the gun.
Don't even think it.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.083
Give me the gun.
Drop it!

33:55.166 --> 33:56.250
Don't do it.

33:56.333 --> 33:58.750
'Drop your gun. Drop it
right now. Drop it!'

33:58.834 --> 34:01.208
Get out of the truck.
Get out of the truck!

34:01.291 --> 34:04.208
Put your hands on the dash.

34:04.291 --> 34:06.417
Nothing stupid.

34:08.792 --> 34:10.417
I think we hit the jackpot.

34:14.458 --> 34:17.375
I said, "I think we
hit the jackpot."

34:18.959 --> 34:21.291
I think we hit
the jackpot now.

34:21.375 --> 34:22.417
Get on your knees.

34:22.500 --> 34:24.333
Come on,
on your knees.

34:32.875 --> 34:34.542
I'm gonna need you
to do something.

34:34.625 --> 34:36.417
I'm gonna need you
to hit whatever panic button

34:36.500 --> 34:37.667
you got in here.

34:37.750 --> 34:39.125
Yeah, I do it,
you start shooting.

34:39.208 --> 34:41.625
Hah, usually, I'd be
giving
you all the reasons

34:41.709 --> 34:42.959
why you shouldn't act.

34:43.041 --> 34:44.959
But this is gonna get
bloody real soon.

34:45.041 --> 34:47.959
You ain't frickin' listening!

34:48.041 --> 34:49.667
You got the boy to consider.

34:49.750 --> 34:50.959
Think about Petey.

34:51.041 --> 34:52.834
He's at a rocky age.

34:54.417 --> 34:56.834
He needs the right guidance.
That's on you.

34:56.917 --> 34:59.667
- Why are you doing this,
Pete?
- Just do it.

35:07.583 --> 35:09.291
You take care of him, okay?

35:11.125 --> 35:12.417
You're his dad now.

35:13.375 --> 35:14.959
(Tommy)
'What the hell?'

35:25.834 --> 35:27.291
Cops pinned it
on a couple pros

35:27.375 --> 35:29.333
who got killed in some
other robbery attempt

35:29.417 --> 35:31.208
a few weeks later.

35:31.291 --> 35:33.333
You didn't set them
straight.

35:33.417 --> 35:35.834
Would have brought up a
whole bunch of questions.

35:35.917 --> 35:38.375
Petey didn't need this
hanging over him.

35:38.458 --> 35:41.542
Cards he was
playing,
convict dad and all

35:41.625 --> 35:43.250
he had enough
to deal with.

35:43.333 --> 35:44.917
Pete kept saying..

35:45.917 --> 35:47.041
"We hit the jackpot."

35:47.125 --> 35:48.542
What'd he mean by that?

35:48.625 --> 35:52.375
Tell you, the way he
was looking around.

35:52.458 --> 35:56.583
Desperate, like he expected
the seventh cavalry.

35:58.834 --> 36:00.250
(Miller)
'It's a signal.'

36:00.333 --> 36:03.291
Undercover says the magic words,
"We hit the jackpot"

36:03.375 --> 36:05.041
the bust goes down.

36:05.125 --> 36:06.500
Pete an informant?

36:08.250 --> 36:11.542
Well, robbery had no undercover
ops in the fall of '97.

36:11.625 --> 36:14.250
Didn't know about the armored
car heist until it happened.

36:14.333 --> 36:15.667
But we've got
a body mic

36:15.750 --> 36:17.792
and wire checked out
of the communications unit

36:17.875 --> 36:20.583
the day of the robbery
and guess whose John Hancock

36:20.667 --> 36:22.375
is on the log.

36:22.458 --> 36:24.583
Officer Daniel O'Leary.

36:25.834 --> 36:28.291
O'Leary was a rule-bender.
But dirty?

36:28.375 --> 36:30.333
He was obsessed with Pete Doyle.

36:30.417 --> 36:34.375
He put a mic on him, sent him
into the heist, then killed
him.

36:34.458 --> 36:36.542
That's guesswork. No body.

36:36.625 --> 36:38.083
No evidence,
nothing but a
signature.

36:38.166 --> 36:41.709
So we pull the equipment,
run it for prints, DNA.

36:41.792 --> 36:43.458
Already checked,
communications threw that
stuff

36:43.542 --> 36:45.333
out a couple years ago.

36:45.417 --> 36:48.208
O'Leary doesn't know that.

36:49.792 --> 36:51.625
(Stillman)
'Know what this is?'

36:51.709 --> 36:53.417
The wire you checked
out of communications

36:53.500 --> 36:55.709
back in September '97.

36:55.792 --> 36:58.250
The one you gave
Pete Doyle to
wear

36:58.333 --> 37:00.333
day of the
armored
car robbery.

37:00.417 --> 37:02.125
(Jeffries)
'Sent it to the lab
for a work-up.'

37:02.208 --> 37:03.750
What do you think they'll find?

37:03.834 --> 37:05.208
What, do you figure
you're scaring me

37:05.291 --> 37:07.291
with the smoke and mirrors?

37:07.375 --> 37:08.625
I'm not some mope.

37:08.709 --> 37:10.792
- I got 20 years on the job.
- True enough.

37:10.875 --> 37:14.208
You were a good cop,
maybe a little rough.

37:14.291 --> 37:16.291
All this fuss
over that dirt bag?

37:16.375 --> 37:18.000
And I was the only
one trying to get

37:18.083 --> 37:19.625
Pete Doyle off the street.

37:19.709 --> 37:20.792
The only one who cared.

37:20.875 --> 37:22.875
Yeah, we talked
to your old lieutenant.

37:22.959 --> 37:24.959
You tried to get robbery
to investigate Pete

37:25.041 --> 37:25.959
'and nobody listened.'

37:26.041 --> 37:27.333
Meanwhile, you were being pushed

37:27.417 --> 37:28.500
out of the department.

37:28.583 --> 37:30.959
Eh, forced retirement.

37:31.041 --> 37:33.625
My style didn't mesh anymore.

37:33.709 --> 37:35.000
Didn't appreciate you.

37:35.083 --> 37:37.333
You know who complains?

37:37.417 --> 37:40.083
Lowlifes. Pissed
'cause they got pinched.

37:40.166 --> 37:42.250
And Pete's out there living
the life of Reilly.

37:42.333 --> 37:45.166
Eh, crooks get rich,
cops get screwed.

37:46.709 --> 37:48.625
We know you were there
the day of the heist.

37:48.709 --> 37:51.417
Juries eat this
kind of evidence
up.

37:51.500 --> 37:54.125
'Work with us here,
it'll go easier.'

37:54.208 --> 37:56.333
You expect me to believe
that this is real?

37:56.417 --> 37:59.750
I'd stake my career on it,
like you did with Pete
Doyle.

38:10.542 --> 38:12.125
It's hanging
heavy on you.

38:14.792 --> 38:16.875
Let it out, O'Leary.
It's time.

38:27.250 --> 38:29.458
All those years on the beat.

38:29.542 --> 38:32.917
I was doing good.
I had honor.

38:35.625 --> 38:37.792
Didn't mean anything.

38:37.875 --> 38:39.583
Pete came to you, didn't he?

38:41.000 --> 38:43.250
Full cooperation..

38:43.333 --> 38:46.041
...as long as his son
was left out.

38:46.125 --> 38:48.333
I was supposed to go
to my bosses over it.

38:48.417 --> 38:49.917
But you didn't.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.542
I was halfway
out the door

38:51.625 --> 38:55.458
looking at a future
with nothing but my pension

38:55.542 --> 38:57.083
a lifetime of debt.

38:59.875 --> 39:02.834
You know how much money
they keep in those trucks?

39:02.917 --> 39:04.875
So, you decided
to rip him off.

39:07.166 --> 39:08.625
What was he going to do?

39:08.709 --> 39:10.667
Call the cops?

39:14.875 --> 39:16.250
Hey!

39:18.083 --> 39:19.250
Where the hell were you?

39:19.333 --> 39:20.750
The money.
Where's the money?

39:20.834 --> 39:22.417
Tommy nearly killed
a guy back there!

39:22.500 --> 39:23.583
Where is it, Pete?

39:23.667 --> 39:25.083
It's on the truck
where it belongs.

39:25.166 --> 39:26.709
I had the guard
hit the panic button.

39:26.792 --> 39:28.750
You were supposed to see
this
through no matter what.

39:28.834 --> 39:30.333
And you were supposed
to stop it, remember?

39:30.417 --> 39:31.583
Before anyone got hurt.

39:31.667 --> 39:33.208
My kid's stepfather
was in there

39:33.291 --> 39:34.917
'for crying out loud.'

39:35.709 --> 39:37.041
Did he recognize you?

39:37.125 --> 39:38.542
What?

39:42.208 --> 39:43.625
What are you doing?

39:46.083 --> 39:47.709
I can't go down for this.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.417
Why didn't you just
get the money?

39:51.500 --> 39:54.375
That's what this
was for you.
Money.

39:54.458 --> 39:55.792
Just shut up!

39:55.875 --> 39:57.542
Get down on your knees.

39:57.625 --> 39:58.959
Do it.

40:06.542 --> 40:07.917
You got ID'd.

40:10.125 --> 40:12.792
Questions are going to come up.

40:12.875 --> 40:15.542
You know what they do
to cops in prison?

40:16.875 --> 40:19.333
I feel sorry for you, O'Leary.

40:19.417 --> 40:20.667
At least I'm honest.

40:20.750 --> 40:23.333
- Stop it!
- I took my second chance.

40:23.417 --> 40:26.041
I did it right,
like I said I
would.

40:26.125 --> 40:28.500
Nothing you do to
me
now changes that.

40:29.417 --> 40:32.083
I'm a good man.
What are you?

43:30.083 --> 43:31.375
