WEBVTT

00:10.100 --> 00:11.830
Good morning, Leonard.

00:12.960 --> 00:14.430
yeah.  we're gonna

00:14.500 --> 00:16.400
Have to stop by pottery barn on the way to work.

00:16.460 --> 00:17.930
I bought these star wars sheets,

00:17.960 --> 00:20.660
But they turned out to be much too stimulating

00:20.730 --> 00:23.700
To be compatible with a good night's sleep.

00:25.300 --> 00:28.100
I don't like the way darth vader stares at me.

00:29.360 --> 00:30.900
I'm not going to work.

00:30.960 --> 00:32.659
Oh,just because your career's been stagnant

00:32.729 --> 00:36.030
For a few years,that's no reason to give up.

00:36.100 --> 00:37.300
Sheldon,i was up all night

00:37.360 --> 00:39.130
Using the new free-electron laser

00:39.200 --> 00:41.360
For x-ray diffraction experiment.

00:41.430 --> 00:44.360
Did the laser accidentally burn out your retinas?

00:44.430 --> 00:45.500
No.

00:45.560 --> 00:47.000
Then you can drive. let's go.

00:49.900 --> 00:52.060
Didn't I tell you I'd be working nights

00:52.130 --> 00:53.860
And that you'd have to make other arrangements?

00:53.930 --> 00:54.560
You did.

00:54.630 --> 00:55.360
And?

00:55.430 --> 00:56.330
I didn't.

00:57.800 --> 00:59.530
Let's go.

01:00.600 --> 01:01.760
Good night,sheldon.

01:01.830 --> 01:03.460
But how am I going to get to work?

01:03.530 --> 01:04.459
Take the bus.

01:04.530 --> 01:05.930
I can't take the bus anymore.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.960
They don't have seat belts,and they won't let you

01:08.030 --> 01:10.500
Latch yourself to the seat with bungee cords.

01:10.560 --> 01:14.230
You tried to latch yourself to the seat with bungee cords?

01:14.300 --> 01:17.000
I didn't try. I succeeded.

01:17.060 --> 01:19.200
But for some reason,it alarmed the other passengers

01:19.260 --> 01:21.360
And I was asked to de-bus.

01:21.430 --> 01:22.900
Oh,you're a big boy.

01:22.960 --> 01:24.360
You'll figure it out.

01:24.430 --> 01:26.300
Don't talk to me like I'm a child.

01:26.360 --> 01:28.600
Now,take me to return  my star wars sheets!

01:30.930 --> 01:32.800
Penny?

01:32.860 --> 01:34.560
Penny? penny?

01:35.600 --> 01:37.960
Sheldon. what is it?

01:38.030 --> 01:40.830
Leonard's asleep.

01:40.900 --> 01:43.530
Thanks for the update.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.730
No. wait.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.400
You have to drive me to work.

01:47.460 --> 01:50.600
Yeah,i really don't think I do.

01:50.660 --> 01:53.530
But I don't drive,and I can't take the bus.

01:53.600 --> 01:55.260
Honey,you'll be fe as long as you don't do

01:55.330 --> 01:56.400
That bungee cord thing,okay?

01:56.460 --> 01:58.230
Penny.

01:58.300 --> 02:01.930
Didn't you recently stated that you and I are friends?

02:02.000 --> 02:06.030
Yes,sheldon. we are friends.

02:06.100 --> 02:08.900
Then I hereby invoke what I'm given to understand

02:08.960 --> 02:12.830
Is an integral part of the implied covenant of friendship.

02:15.300 --> 02:18.260
The favor.

02:18.330 --> 02:20.700
Oh,dear god.

02:20.760 --> 02:22.500
I'm sorry,i didn't realize

02:22.560 --> 02:25.360
I was interrupting your morning prayers.

02:25.430 --> 02:27.600
When you're done,we'll go.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:54.730 --> 02:57.130
Thank you for driving me to work.

02:57.200 --> 02:58.730
You know this is my day off,sheldon.

02:58.800 --> 03:01.400
Oh,good. I'm not keeping you from anything.

03:04.460 --> 03:06.330
Your "check engine" light is on.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.530
Typically that's an indicator

03:09.600 --> 03:12.200
To,you know,check your engine.

03:12.260 --> 03:15.160
It's fine. it's been on for,like,a month.

03:15.230 --> 03:17.800
Well,actually,that would be all the more reason to...

03:17.860 --> 03:20.300
You know,check your engine.

03:20.360 --> 03:22.130
Sheldon,it's fine.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.200
If it were fine,

03:23.260 --> 03:24.530
The light wouldn't be on.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.600
That's why the manufacturer installed that light,

03:26.660 --> 03:28.630
To let you know it's not fine.

03:28.700 --> 03:30.530
Maybe the light's broken.

03:30.600 --> 03:35.530
Is there a "check the 'check engine light' light"?

03:37.500 --> 03:39.160
What?

03:39.230 --> 03:41.100
Studies have shown that performing tasks

03:41.160 --> 03:42.960
Such as eating,talking on a cell phone

03:43.030 --> 03:44.600
Or drinking coffee while driving

03:44.660 --> 03:46.100
Reduces one's reaction time

03:46.160 --> 03:48.200
By the same factor as an ounce of alcohol.

03:48.260 --> 03:50.060
Do you have any alcohol?

03:50.130 --> 03:50.900
Of course not.

03:50.960 --> 03:52.300
Too bad.

03:55.660 --> 03:56.900
You're going up euclid avenue?

03:58.760 --> 04:00.530
Leonard takes los robles avenu

04:00.600 --> 04:02.730
Well,good for leonard.

04:02.800 --> 04:05.560
Euclid avenue is shorter as the crow flies,

04:05.630 --> 04:07.530
But it has speed bumps,which appreciably increase

04:07.600 --> 04:08.930
Point-to-point drive time,

04:09.000 --> 04:10.260
Making It the less efficient choice.

04:12.300 --> 04:13.700
But you have the conn.

04:16.800 --> 04:18.730
Of course,if you're not going to slow down

04:18.800 --> 04:19.800
For the speed bumps,

04:19.860 --> 04:21.459
I withdraw my previous objection.

04:23.660 --> 04:25.430
Here's a fun question.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.960
Do you know what the most common street name is?

04:28.030 --> 04:28.930
No.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.730
The answer's tricky.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.060
It's second street.

04:33.130 --> 04:35.130
You see,you'd think it would be first street,

04:35.200 --> 04:36.730
But in most towns,first street eventually

04:36.800 --> 04:37.800
Gets renamed to something else.

04:37.860 --> 04:40.260
You know,like main street,

04:40.330 --> 04:41.930
Broad street.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.930
Michigan avenue.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.960
See,leonard and I   often use our commute time

04:46.030 --> 04:48.560
To exercise our minds  with brain-teasers like that.

04:48.630 --> 04:50.400
We also play games.

04:52.400 --> 04:53.830
Would you like to play one?

04:53.900 --> 04:55.230
No.

04:55.300 --> 04:56.400
Oh,come on. it's fun.

04:56.460 --> 05:00.730
Ooh! another bump.

05:00.800 --> 05:04.400
Okay. I'll say an element,and,and you say an element

05:04.460 --> 05:05.860
Whose name starts with the last letter

05:05.930 --> 05:07.300
Of the one I said,okay?

05:09.130 --> 05:10.230
I'll start.

05:11.660 --> 05:12.760
Helium.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.960
Now,you could say "mercury."

05:19.030 --> 05:20.730
That would give me a "y."

05:20.800 --> 05:23.460
Ooh. very clever.   that's a tough one.

05:23.530 --> 05:26.760
So I go with "ytterbium," which gets you back to "m."

05:26.830 --> 05:30.860
So you go "molybdenum," and I say "magnesium."

05:30.930 --> 05:34.160
You say "manganese." I say "europium,"

05:34.230 --> 05:36.230
And,then,you're left with "mendelevium,"

05:36.300 --> 05:38.230
And... there are   no more m's

05:38.300 --> 05:39.430
Because I believe that meitnerium

05:39.500 --> 05:41.060
Should still be called ekairidium.

05:41.130 --> 05:43.760
So,congratulations. you win.

05:47.730 --> 05:49.960
Do you wanna go again?

05:50.030 --> 05:53.000
Why don't we just have a little quiet time now?

05:53.060 --> 05:54.700
All right.

05:59.860 --> 06:00.930
I'm sorry.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.630
I'm finding your reckless nonchalance

06:02.700 --> 06:05.430
Regarding the check-engine light to be very troubling.

06:08.960 --> 06:11.630
Get out.

06:11.700 --> 06:13.500
Well,i ve to tell you

06:13.560 --> 06:15.700
That while I do have a theoretical understanding

06:15.760 --> 06:17.500
Of the workings of an internal combustion engine,

06:17.560 --> 06:20.360
I'm not sure I'm capable  of performing diagnostics.

06:20.430 --> 06:22.360
I said,"get out."

06:22.430 --> 06:24.360
Okay. I'll give it a shot.

06:39.360 --> 06:41.000
Oh,leonard. there you are.

06:41.060 --> 06:42.530
I'm ready to go home.

06:44.230 --> 06:45.500
T1  I just got here.

06:45.560 --> 06:47.700
Good. perfect timing.

06:47.760 --> 06:48.800
Sheldon,

06:48.830 --> 06:50.200
Told you,i only have access

06:50.260 --> 06:51.600
To the free-electron laser at night.

06:51.660 --> 06:53.500
I can't drive you for the next few weeks.

06:53.560 --> 06:55.530
No,you said you couldn't drive me to work.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.160
this is from work.

06:57.230 --> 06:59.500
Howard, help me out here.

06:59.560 --> 07:03.530
No,just for the fun of it,i'm gonna take his side.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.160
Now,

07:05.230 --> 07:06.700
How do you propose I get home?

07:06.760 --> 07:08.930
How did you get here in the first place?

07:09.000 --> 07:10.230
Penny.

07:10.300 --> 07:13.700
But I sense that's no longer an option.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.330
Look,i need to get edto the laser lab.

07:15.400 --> 07:16.560
You're just gonna have

07:16.630 --> 07:18.860
To find someone else to take you home.

07:25.100 --> 07:28.330
Ah,damn,i picked the wrong side.

07:33.430 --> 07:36.300
Oh,god,not euclid avenue!

07:42.730 --> 07:44.130
Why did howard leave you

07:44.200 --> 07:46.560
In the middle of the road anyway?

07:47.600 --> 07:49.460
We had a difference of opinion.

07:49.530 --> 07:50.800
Over what?

07:50.860 --> 07:53.800
Whether or not he was trying to kill me.

07:53.860 --> 07:56.130
For the record,i maintain he was.

07:57.200 --> 07:58.760
Where are you going?

07:58.830 --> 08:00.060
I'm taking you home.

08:00.130 --> 08:01.330
Oh,but I'm not going home.

08:01.400 --> 08:02.430
It's wednesday.

08:02.500 --> 08:03.560
Wednesday's new comic book day.

08:03.630 --> 08:05.260
We have to go to the comic book store.

08:05.330 --> 08:07.200
And then,we have to stop

08:07.260 --> 08:10.400
At soup plantation; it's creamy tomato soup day.

08:10.460 --> 08:11.500
And radio shack.

08:11.560 --> 08:13.900
There's a sale on triple-a batteries.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.530
Plus,we have to go to pottery barn

08:15.600 --> 08:16.930
And return my star wars sheets.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.100
I have a better idea.

08:20.230 --> 08:22.660
You want to go to pottery barn first?

08:34.059 --> 08:36.559
Can you drive me to pottery barn?

08:42.600 --> 08:44.360
Maybe if I turn off the night-light,

08:44.430 --> 08:46.060
I can keep the sheets.

08:57.630 --> 08:59.060
Good morning.

09:01.060 --> 09:02.930
Good morning.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.960
Sheldon,sit down.

09:05.030 --> 09:06.660
She's in my spot.

09:10.200 --> 09:11.360
Don't look at me like that.

09:11.430 --> 09:12.730
Everybody knows that my spot.

09:17.430 --> 09:21.630
Sheldon,you know  that we care about you.

09:21.700 --> 09:23.560
And it's because we care about you

09:23.630 --> 09:25.860
That we've decided we have to speak up.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.900
You're hurting the people around you,sweetie.

09:32.960 --> 09:34.260
So we made you an appointment,

09:34.330 --> 09:36.730
And we want you to keep it.

09:38.530 --> 09:41.760
Department of motor vehicles new driver handbook?

09:45.560 --> 09:48.100
But I don't have a problem.

09:48.160 --> 09:51.330
Sheldon,you need to learn how to drive.

09:51.400 --> 09:53.830
This madness has to stop.

09:55.030 --> 09:56.800
Penny's taking you to the dmv.

09:56.860 --> 09:57.630
I'm going to bed.

09:57.700 --> 09:58.800
Why penny?

09:58.860 --> 10:00.660
Because rock breaks scissors.

10:00.760 --> 10:02.300
Good night.

10:02.360 --> 10:04.230
All right,come on,sheldon.

10:04.300 --> 10:05.430
Hold on.

10:05.500 --> 10:06.800
I have one condition.

10:06.860 --> 10:07.860
What?

10:07.930 --> 10:09.800
We have to stop at pottery barn.

10:09.860 --> 10:11.400
Okay.

10:11.460 --> 10:13.800
And radio shack.

10:13.860 --> 10:15.460
Fine.

10:16.530 --> 10:17.560
And the comic book store.

10:17.630 --> 10:19.200
All right!

10:19.260 --> 10:21.530
Ooh,i want to go to the comic book store.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.550
I like comic books.

10:47.630 --> 10:50.530
I just don't see why I need a driver's license.

10:50.600 --> 10:53.800
Albert einstein never had a driver's license.

10:53.860 --> 10:56.760
Yeah,but albert einstein didn't make me wet myself

10:56.830 --> 10:59.260
At 40 miles an hour.

10:59.330 --> 11:02.500
Yeah,and I never wanted to kick albert einstein in the nuts.

11:06.330 --> 11:07.800
You know,i gotta ask,why didn't you just

11:07.860 --> 11:10.130
Get a license at 16 like everybody else?

11:10.200 --> 11:13.030
I was otherwise engaged.

11:13.100 --> 11:14.560
Doing what?

11:14.630 --> 11:17.200
Examining perturbative amplitudes

11:17.260 --> 11:19.100
In n=4 supersymmetric theories

11:19.160 --> 11:21.600
Leading to a re-examination of the ultraviolet properties

11:21.660 --> 11:25.260
Of multi-loop n=8 supergravity using modern twistor theory.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.230
Well,how 'bout when you were 17?

11:33.430 --> 11:34.760
Take this to the testing area,

11:34.830 --> 11:36.330
Put your name at the top,sign the bottom,

11:36.400 --> 11:38.760
Answer the questions,bring it back. next

11:44.260 --> 11:45.200
Application?

11:45.260 --> 11:49.030
I'm actually more of a theorist.

11:50.430 --> 11:52.530
The application in your hand.

11:52.600 --> 11:53.560
Give it to her.

11:58.300 --> 11:59.830
Take this to the testing area,

11:59.900 --> 12:01.160
Put your name at the top,sign the bottom,

12:01.230 --> 12:03.230
Answer the questions,bring it back. next!

12:03.300 --> 12:07.060
Excuse me,but I have some concerns about these questions.

12:07.130 --> 12:09.200
Look at that sign up there.

12:09.260 --> 12:10.830
Yes?

12:10.900 --> 12:14.130
Does it say "i give a damn"?

12:14.200 --> 12:16.360
No.

12:16.430 --> 12:18.330
That's because I don't.

12:18.400 --> 12:19.800
Just look.

12:19.860 --> 12:21.530
See,this first question makes no sense.

12:21.600 --> 12:23.560
"how many car lengths

12:23.630 --> 12:25.460
Should you leave in front of you when driving?"

12:25.530 --> 12:27.700
There's no possible way to answer that.

12:27.760 --> 12:31.430
A "car length" is not a standardized unit of measure.

12:31.500 --> 12:34.100
Look at the sign.

12:34.160 --> 12:36.530
Sheldon,it's "c." just put down "c."

12:36.600 --> 12:37.730
I don't need yourelp,penny.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.060
Listen to that little girl,honey.

12:39.130 --> 12:40.630
Put "c." next!

12:40.700 --> 12:41.930
No,wait! no,hang on.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.100
Look at this next question.

12:43.160 --> 12:46.460
Sheldon,why are you arguing with the dmv?

12:46.530 --> 12:49.400
How else are they going to learn?

12:50.500 --> 12:51.430
Look...

12:52.930 --> 12:55.460
"when are roadways most slippery?"

12:55.530 --> 12:56.800
Now,okay,there are three answers,

12:56.860 --> 12:57.930
None of which are correct.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
The correct answer is "when covered by

13:00.060 --> 13:01.560
"a film of liquid sufficient to reduce

13:01.630 --> 13:03.000
"the coefficient of static friction

13:03.060 --> 13:05.100
"between the tire and the road to essentially zero,

13:05.160 --> 13:08.000
But not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction."

13:12.730 --> 13:15.260
Here's your learner's permit. go away.

13:15.330 --> 13:17.360
But I'm not done.

13:17.430 --> 13:18.900
I have many additial concerns

13:18.960 --> 13:20.300
About these questions.

13:20.360 --> 13:21.400
Don't make me climb over this counter.

13:21.460 --> 13:22.400
Come on. let's go. come on.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.530
Next!

13:26.600 --> 13:28.300
Aced it.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.800
Okay,that's it.

13:33.860 --> 13:35.000
Let's boot it up.

13:35.060 --> 13:36.400
Booting.

13:36.460 --> 13:39.060
This is a state-of-the-art simulator.

13:39.130 --> 13:40.200
I adapted it from something

13:40.260 --> 13:41.800
A friend of mine designed for the army.

13:41.860 --> 13:43.930
Is that why I appear to be in downtown fallujah

13:44.000 --> 13:46.660
Behind the wheel of an up-armored humvee?

13:46.730 --> 13:49.660
I haven't configured it yet.

13:49.730 --> 13:50.930
Let's see...

13:51.000 --> 13:52.560
Bradley tank...

13:52.630 --> 13:54.630
Transport truck...  batmobile...

13:54.700 --> 13:57.330
Ooh! no.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.830
Here we go. red 2006 ford taurus

13:59.900 --> 14:01.800
On the streets of pasadena.

14:03.530 --> 14:04.830
What?

14:04.900 --> 14:06.860
Statistically,red cars are stopped by police

14:06.930 --> 14:08.560
Far more often than any other color.

14:08.630 --> 14:11.530
I don't want any hassles with the fuzz.

14:11.600 --> 14:14.400
Fine,what color do you want?

14:14.460 --> 14:18.500
You know the pale blue of luke skywalker's lightsaber?

14:19.860 --> 14:23.060
Before it was digitally remastered?

14:24.500 --> 14:25.930
Black,it is.

14:27.630 --> 14:29.160
Okay,now,what you want to do first

14:29.230 --> 14:30.430
Is turn on the ignition

14:30.500 --> 14:31.830
And shift into drive.

14:31.900 --> 14:34.030
I haven't fastened my seat belt yet.

14:36.300 --> 14:38.200
Okay,fasten your seat belt.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Click

14:48.300 --> 14:49.930
Now,are there air bags?

14:50.000 --> 14:51.530
You don't need air bags.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.130
What if a simulated van  rear-ends me?

14:53.200 --> 14:57.460
I'll hit you in the face with a pillow.

15:04.300 --> 15:06.630
Okay,now shift into drive.

15:06.700 --> 15:08.830
Pull out slowly into traffic.

15:11.430 --> 15:13.460
Watch out,watch,watch out for the pedestrians!

15:13.530 --> 15:14.960
Oh,god.

15:15.030 --> 15:16.560
Wait-- slow--

15:16.630 --> 15:18.030
Hit the brakes! the brakes!

15:29.260 --> 15:31.760
Thank you.

15:34.360 --> 15:35.900
Sorry.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.560
Excuse me.

15:39.130 --> 15:41.060
My bad.

15:43.130 --> 15:45.430
Student driver.

15:45.500 --> 15:47.430
How did you manage

15:47.500 --> 15:50.400
To get on the second floor of the glendale galleria?

15:50.460 --> 15:52.800
I don't know.

15:52.860 --> 15:55.130
I was on the pasadena freeway. I missed my exit,

15:55.200 --> 15:58.200
Flew off the overpass,and one thing led to another.

16:00.100 --> 16:03.200
Maybe you want to give it a rest and try again tomorrow.

16:03.260 --> 16:05.130
No. I quit.

16:12.700 --> 16:15.730
Aw,the pet store.

16:17.230 --> 16:19.700
Remind me to compliment wolowitz on the software.

16:19.760 --> 16:22.600
It's amazingly detailed.

16:22.660 --> 16:25.360
Th  so wait,you're just gonna give up?

16:25.430 --> 16:27.260
No,i'm not giving up.

16:27.330 --> 16:29.300
I never give up.

16:29.360 --> 16:31.630
So,what is it you're doing?

16:31.700 --> 16:33.660
I'm...

16:33.730 --> 16:35.700
Transcending the situation.

16:39.660 --> 16:43.160
I'm clearly too evolved for driving.

16:45.900 --> 16:47.960
What does that mean?

16:48.030 --> 16:51.360
Leonard,have you ever wondered why my little toes

16:51.430 --> 16:54.400
And lateral incisors are significantly smaller

16:54.460 --> 16:57.430
Than the average for someone of my size?

16:57.500 --> 17:00.260
I wonder a lot of things about you,sheldon.

17:00.330 --> 17:02.700
But not-not that.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.700
Well,those are indicators

17:04.760 --> 17:06.829
That I'm farther along the evolutionary scale

17:06.900 --> 17:08.000
Than the average human.

17:08.060 --> 17:09.730
- No kidding. - well,no,no.

17:09.800 --> 17:11.430
I'm not gonna go so far as to say

17:11.500 --> 17:14.160
That I represent a distinct new stage in humankind--

17:14.230 --> 17:17.200
You know,a homo novus,if you will.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.930
No,that's for anthropologists to decide.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.859
But I am convinced

17:22.930 --> 17:25.900
That the rson I cannot master the plebeian task of driving

17:25.960 --> 17:28.000
Is because I'm not meant to.

17:28.060 --> 17:29.530
Yes,you are.

17:29.600 --> 17:30.830
You're meant to learn how to drive.

17:30.900 --> 17:31.600
Please learn how to drive!

17:31.660 --> 17:33.060
No,no.

17:33.130 --> 17:34.730
Leonard,i'm meant for greater things,

17:34.800 --> 17:37.000
Like unraveling the mysteries of the universe,

17:37.060 --> 17:38.600
Not determining when it's safe

17:38.660 --> 17:41.900
To pass a stopped school bus on a country road.

17:41.960 --> 17:44.500
It's never safe.

17:44.560 --> 17:47.630
Yeah,well,i know that now.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.460
Fine.

17:49.530 --> 17:51.560
Assuming that everything you say is true,

17:51.630 --> 17:53.960
How does the biologically superior homo novus

17:54.030 --> 17:55.400
Get to work tomorrow morning?

17:56.430 --> 17:58.460
Homo novus doesn't know.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.930
Well,hang in there.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.830
Maybe you'll evolve into something with wings.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.530
Good morning,gentlemen.

18:17.600 --> 18:20.300
Hey. good morning.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.760
Is there some new kind of casual friday

18:22.830 --> 18:24.260
I don't know about?

18:24.330 --> 18:26.460
No,he lives here now.

18:26.530 --> 18:28.960
Really? why?

18:29.030 --> 18:31.460
Since he won't take the bus and he's too evolved to drive,

18:31.530 --> 18:33.900
He decided it would be easier to just sleep in his office

18:33.960 --> 18:35.300
And shower in the radiation lab

18:35.360 --> 18:37.200
Until I'm finished with my experiment.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.930
But you finished your experiment a week ago.

18:40.931 --> 18:41.931
Yep

18:57.500 --> 18:59.100
Ay,dios mio.

18:59.160 --> 19:00.760
Tra vez?

19:00.830 --> 19:03.500
Deben ser rata

19:03.560 --> 19:06.300
Las ratas no hacen pan tostado

19:06.360 --> 19:08.500
Y le cortan las orillas.

19:15.930 --> 19:17.300
Ay,dios mio!

19:17.360 --> 19:21.230
You saw nothing!

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
