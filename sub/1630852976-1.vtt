who was no explorer at all.

16:35.294 --> 16:36.428
When I was a boy...

16:38.397 --> 16:42.201
...she would point
to the night sky and say,

16:42.267 --> 16:45.270
"Look up, Jean-Luc,

16:45.337 --> 16:48.006
"and let's see

16:48.073 --> 16:50.342
what's out there."

17:02.187 --> 17:04.022
(tone sounding rhythmically)

17:24.543 --> 17:26.545
(speaking foreign language)

17:35.187 --> 17:39.091
-(grunts)
-Psst.

17:39.158 --> 17:40.259
I'm a little occupied
at the moment.

17:42.628 --> 17:45.798
PIRATE:
Come on out, freak.

17:45.864 --> 17:47.666
Show me your ugly Borg face.

17:54.606 --> 17:56.675
(grunting)

18:03.415 --> 18:04.349
Let's try this another way.

18:04.416 --> 18:07.486
The medical supplies
you're attempting to steal

18:07.553 --> 18:09.354
are the property of
the Fenris Rangers.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.490
If you leave now...

18:15.294 --> 18:17.329
Emmet, a little help
here, please.

18:22.167 --> 18:23.135
(yawns)

18:25.537 --> 18:28.173
(grunting)

18:31.310 --> 18:34.646
Computer, disengage hologram
safety protocols.

18:34.713 --> 18:36.515
COMPUTER:
Safety protocols deactivated.

18:36.582 --> 18:38.417
(grunting)

18:49.294 --> 18:52.130
(sighs)

18:52.197 --> 18:55.200
Ah...

18:56.201 --> 18:57.603
Thanks.

19:08.247 --> 19:09.648
(grunts)

19:13.552 --> 19:14.486
No.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.376
Stop talking.

19:40.646 --> 19:41.947
I never should have
merged the holos.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.448
There's got to be a way
to disable

19:43.515 --> 19:44.550
your therapeutic plug-ins.

19:52.291 --> 19:54.293
There it is.

19:56.495 --> 19:58.530
You were saying,
about outside?

20:06.405 --> 20:07.406
Show me.

20:10.742 --> 20:12.544
(distorted noise)

20:19.585 --> 20:21.753
What the hell is that?

20:34.600 --> 20:37.569
(Chopin's "Nocturne No. 1
in B Major, Op. 32" playing)

20:37.636 --> 20:41.506
SOJI:
If I may, I'd like
to make a toast.

20:57.356 --> 20:59.691
We've been touring the galaxy
for over a year

20:59.758 --> 21:02.527
since the Federation
ended the ban on synthetics,

21:02.594 --> 21:04.997
and in that time
I've learned one thing:

21:05.063 --> 21:08.300
you can't ask for trust
through an interpreter.

21:08.367 --> 21:11.637
It needs to come from here,
through here.

21:17.075 --> 21:19.411
(laughter)

21:19.478 --> 21:20.712
(applause)

21:20.779 --> 21:23.582
She runs one sub-routine
on toasts

21:23.649 --> 21:24.750
and she's the belle
of the ball.

21:24.816 --> 21:26.385
(laughs)

21:26.451 --> 21:29.287
She certainly is impressive.

21:29.354 --> 21:32.357
Wow. Bright.

21:32.424 --> 21:34.426
May I?

21:34.493 --> 21:36.662
I don't bite.

21:39.665 --> 21:41.566
I just wanted to see
what hands could create

21:41.633 --> 21:42.734
such a wonder.

21:42.801 --> 21:44.836
(clears throat)

21:44.903 --> 21:46.571
You're flirting, right?

21:46.638 --> 21:48.840
This is how really
pretty people flirt, isn't it?

21:48.907 --> 21:50.542
Oh.

21:50.609 --> 21:52.678
(slurping)

21:52.744 --> 21:54.713
You know, look, I'm half
in the bag anyway,

21:54.780 --> 21:57.382
so I'm gonna give you
a little advice.

21:57.449 --> 21:59.685
Uh, my longest lasting
intimate relationship,

21:59.751 --> 22:01.453
including the one
that I just ended,

22:01.520 --> 22:02.654
is less than a year.

22:02.721 --> 22:06.058
I was recently cleared of
murdering my previous boyfriend

22:06.124 --> 22:08.360
due to alien-induced
temporary insanity,

22:08.427 --> 22:11.797
so I'm not exactly
dating material.

22:11.863 --> 22:14.733
You know?

22:14.800 --> 22:16.735
(communicator chirps)

22:16.802 --> 22:18.670
Oh, thank God.

22:18.737 --> 22:19.604
RIOS (over comm):
Confused.

22:19.671 --> 22:21.640
"Never talk to me again"
was literally

22:21.707 --> 22:23.675
the last thing you ever
said to me.

22:23.742 --> 22:25.377
SOJI:
In the nick of time.

22:25.444 --> 22:26.712
I thought I was going
to have to break into

22:26.778 --> 22:28.080
a medley of Deltan folk songs.

22:28.146 --> 22:30.615
A hard-to-replace opportunity
to be sure, but...

22:30.682 --> 22:33.452
I know. Rios called.
You're going.

22:33.518 --> 22:36.488
I'm staying here to continue
being charmingly diplomatic.

22:36.555 --> 22:37.656
If, by "heard,"
you mean you eavesdropped

22:37.723 --> 22:40.358
on my private comms link
using your super robot hearing.

22:40.425 --> 22:41.893
Well, you did ask me
to monitor you

22:41.960 --> 22:44.429
for any potential
drunk hailing incidents,

22:44.496 --> 22:46.832
so I extended the caution
to drunk answering.

22:46.898 --> 22:49.468
I feel like that's an
exploitation of a technicality.

22:49.534 --> 22:51.369
I'll call as soon as I know
when we'll be back.

22:51.436 --> 22:53.572
I have a feeling you're gonna
be just fine without me.

22:53.638 --> 22:54.906
And what about you and,
you know?

22:54.973 --> 22:56.775
Yeah, I have to confess,
the whole

22:56.842 --> 22:57.909
"we can totally still
work together" thing

22:57.976 --> 22:59.644
made a lot more sense
back on Earth.

22:59.711 --> 23:02.748
I would never say
I told you so,

23:02.814 --> 23:06.585
but his new job does come
with a lot of pressure.

23:06.651 --> 23:08.720
Please. How hard can it be?

23:08.787 --> 23:10.522
One to beam up.

23:18.597 --> 23:21.666
So, what's the big hurry,
Captain.

23:21.733 --> 23:22.768
Shelve that. There's no time.

23:22.834 --> 23:24.903
Give me a sec.
Kemi, get us there

23:24.970 --> 23:27.539
as fast as you can short of
flying us through a sun.

23:27.606 --> 23:29.641
-Comms, anything yet?
-Nothing, Captain.

23:29.708 --> 23:31.643
Keep trying.

23:31.710 --> 23:34.412
Lieutenant Urtern, I'll need
offensive and defensive

23:34.479 --> 23:35.213
strategy reports.

23:35.280 --> 23:36.414
I don't want to
get there without

23:36.481 --> 23:39.451
a possible engagement plan.

23:39.518 --> 23:41.720
-You good?
-Yes, sir.

23:41.787 --> 23:42.921
Always on point. Thank you.

23:42.988 --> 23:45.457
Sorry, some kind
of subspace anomaly.

23:45.524 --> 23:46.858
Starfleet's ordered us
to investigate.

23:46.925 --> 23:48.794
I could use you
on this one.

23:48.860 --> 23:51.163
Your... your brain, I mean.

23:51.229 --> 23:56.168
Well, that's kind of kind.

23:56.234 --> 23:58.170
KEMI:
Course set, Captain.

23:58.236 --> 24:00.639
Dale.

24:00.705 --> 24:02.707
"Make it so."

24:02.774 --> 24:05.577
Oh, the pressure of legacy.

24:05.644 --> 24:07.712
It's your own fault, you know.

24:07.779 --> 24:12.651
No one told you to accept
a command with baggage.

24:46.618 --> 24:49.855
OFFICER:
Bri'onn Raul.
Assignment: the Hikaru Sulu.

24:49.921 --> 24:53.491
Cadet Maxwell Nagata.
Assignment: the Grissom.

24:53.558 --> 24:55.894
Please report to your designated
transport berths.

24:58.597 --> 24:59.998
RAFFI:
So, how are things?

25:00.065 --> 25:04.569
-I'm considering an update
to the Kobayashi Maru.
-Good.

25:04.636 --> 25:06.705
I hate that test.

25:06.771 --> 25:08.573
Well, I am very happy to be

25:08.640 --> 25:11.042
chancellor of the Academy,
thank you very much.

25:11.109 --> 25:12.844
Mm-hmm. Sure.

25:12.911 --> 25:15.280
It forces you to focus
on Starfleet

25:15.347 --> 25:18.683
instead of, you know, you.

25:18.750 --> 25:20.886
And how is Seven these days?

25:20.952 --> 25:23.822
(chuckles) Touché.

25:23.889 --> 25:25.924
You know Seven.

25:25.991 --> 25:27.893
There's always folks
out there in trouble.

25:27.959 --> 25:30.562
What kind of asshole needs to be
more important than that?

25:30.629 --> 25:34.799
But you would like to be.
To her.

25:34.866 --> 25:37.936
Well, I guess she has me hoping

25:38.003 --> 25:41.039
for something more.

25:42.073 --> 25:44.542
You wouldn't understand.

25:44.609 --> 25:47.045
I-I mean, of course,
of course you'd understand.

25:47.112 --> 25:48.947
It's just that,
at the end of the day,

25:49.014 --> 25:51.883
you two are so damn
self-sufficient,

25:51.950 --> 25:53.919
happy to travel the stars.

25:53.985 --> 25:57.589
Hell, I wonder if either of you
even get lonely.

26:01.159 --> 26:04.596
FEMALE VOICE:
Cadet Elnor.
Assignment: the Excelsior.

26:06.131 --> 26:07.065
Elnor.

26:07.132 --> 26:09.668
Admiral Picard.

26:09.734 --> 26:11.336
I'd hoped to see you
before my departure.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.605
-Exciting time.
-Yes.

26:13.672 --> 26:15.573
I'm very excited.

26:15.640 --> 26:17.676
But I'm also worried
my excitement

26:17.742 --> 26:20.345
may be distracting me
from my studies.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.580
It's paradoxical.

26:22.647 --> 26:24.616
You know, there's a quote
in this book

26:24.683 --> 26:26.584
that would be very appropriate.

26:26.651 --> 26:29.587
This is written
by Spock himself,

26:29.654 --> 26:33.825
and it's a memoir of the
challenges that he faced

26:33.892 --> 26:37.896
when he was one of the first
Vulcan cadets in Starfleet.

26:37.963 --> 26:41.866
"Exhilaration enhances

26:41.933 --> 26:45.003
the absorption of knowledge."

26:45.070 --> 26:48.707
In other words, live a little.

26:48.773 --> 26:49.841
(chuckles)

26:53.044 --> 26:54.746
I will cherish it.

26:56.014 --> 26:58.083
Thank you for the book, Admiral.

26:58.149 --> 27:01.086
Better get moving, cadet.
We ship out in ten.

27:02.554 --> 27:06.691
OFFICER (over P.A.):
Commander Musiker, please report
to the Excelsior for departure.

27:06.758 --> 27:08.126
Same ship.

27:08.193 --> 27:10.628
Keeping him under your wing.

27:10.695 --> 27:13.898
That boy's absolute candor
can get his ass kicked.

27:13.965 --> 27:17.402
-(chuckles)
-So I'm protective of him.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.738
Frankly, I find it
very pleasing.

27:20.572 --> 27:23.108
OFFICER (over P.A.):
All officers and cadets
to their ship for departure.

27:23.174 --> 27:25.643
Mmm, they're playing my song.

27:25.710 --> 27:27.045
Safe journeys.

27:29.914 --> 27:32.117
-Admiral.
-Commander.

27:54.472 --> 27:56.674
(distorted noise)

28:13.124 --> 28:15.860
Lieutenant Urtern,
what am I looking at?

28:15.927 --> 28:17.228
Spatial anomaly, Captain.

28:17.295 --> 28:18.930
Minor tachyon levels,
but nothing critical.

28:18.997 --> 28:20.965
For the moment
it appears stable.

28:21.032 --> 28:23.468
The fabric of space-time rending

28:23.535 --> 28:25.937
does not really shout stability.

28:26.004 --> 28:29.174
-Captain Rios,
we're being hailed.
-On screen.

28:31.910 --> 28:33.912
What are you doing here?

28:33.978 --> 28:35.980
I was about to ask the same.

28:37.182 --> 28:39.951
What the hell did you do
to my ship?

28:40.018 --> 28:40.985
Correction, my ship.

28:41.052 --> 28:42.821
Look after her, I said.

28:42.887 --> 28:45.256
Instead, I used her
to take care of others,

28:45.323 --> 28:48.126
which, in my line of work,
can occasionally be violent.

28:48.193 --> 28:49.894
Besides, a few dents
look good on her.

28:49.961 --> 28:52.030
Hi, Seven.

28:52.097 --> 28:53.798
(loud static)

28:53.865 --> 28:54.899
Lieutenant Sing?

28:54.966 --> 28:57.769
Signal is originating
inside the anomaly, Captain.

28:57.836 --> 29:00.004
A message of some kind?

29:00.071 --> 29:01.739
SING:
Running it through
the universal translator.

29:01.806 --> 29:05.210
Coming back inconclusive, sir.

29:05.276 --> 29:06.744
A peculiar way of saying hello.

29:06.811 --> 29:07.946
Let me deal with this.

29:08.012 --> 29:10.014
(grunts)

29:10.982 --> 29:12.984
Oh, sorry.

29:13.051 --> 29:15.019
(clears throat)
Captain, may I?

29:16.354 --> 29:17.755
Captain?

29:17.822 --> 29:18.790
Lieutenant, trust me,
you'll find it

29:18.857 --> 29:20.225
much easier to just defer.

29:24.229 --> 29:26.030
Displaying the signal
as a waveform.

29:26.097 --> 29:27.899
Scattered, chaotic.

29:27.966 --> 29:30.168
Analyzing.

29:30.235 --> 29:32.904
Not language. Languages. Plural.

29:32.971 --> 29:35.974
Dozens of them, all overlaid.

29:36.040 --> 29:39.777
All asking... no, pleading.

29:39.844 --> 29:44.048
Agnes... what does it say?

29:45.083 --> 29:47.986
It says, "Help us."

29:48.052 --> 29:49.787
"Help us, Picard."

29:49.854 --> 29:52.323
DISTORTED VOICE:
Help us, Picard.

29:52.390 --> 29:55.326
Help us, Picard.

30:10.975 --> 30:12.977

31:03.294 --> 31:05.296

Admiral.

Oh, excuse me.
Admiral.

But you'll always be
Captain to me.

31:15.340 --> 31:17.275
Hello, Guinan.

31:17.342 --> 31:19.143
It's so good to see you.

31:19.210 --> 31:21.145
And you.

31:21.212 --> 31:25.917
Um, this is
for your private reserve.

31:25.984 --> 31:28.886
Oh, well, with you
pushing a century,

31:28.953 --> 31:31.656
and me pushing several,
I, I don't really think,

31:31.723 --> 31:34.025
at our age, we should be
reserving anything.

31:34.092 --> 31:37.962
Well, El-Aurians age

31:38.029 --> 31:39.897
so very slowly.

31:39.964 --> 31:42.200
Yes, but only if we choose to.

31:42.267 --> 31:46.971
Now, I noticed that humans
don't like to be

31:47.038 --> 31:48.439
reminded of their mortality,

31:48.506 --> 31:51.042
so I, I try to keep up.

31:51.109 --> 31:54.112
(chuckles)
Well, thank you.

31:54.912 --> 31:57.448
I don't think you're here
to reminisce

31:57.515 --> 32:00.018
about the old days.

32:00.084 --> 32:04.289
Seems like the new ones are
what's troubling you now.

32:06.024 --> 32:07.458
What's wrong?

32:07.525 --> 32:11.062
-I can't just miss
a dear old friend?
-You can.

32:11.129 --> 32:13.064
But I've held your hand
while you've navigated

32:13.131 --> 32:15.199
Federation diplomacy disasters.

32:15.266 --> 32:18.436
I've seen you face down
some new galactic threat.

32:18.503 --> 32:22.473
We have jumped universes
together.

32:22.540 --> 32:23.941
I've got to say,

32:24.008 --> 32:25.943
I don't remember ever

32:26.010 --> 32:27.211
seeing you look quite like...

32:30.214 --> 32:31.716
Oh, oh.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.251
I'm gonna take that back.

32:33.318 --> 32:35.687
I have seen you look like this.

32:35.753 --> 32:37.989
And it's serious.

32:38.056 --> 32:40.491
So this, as lovely as it is,
is not gonna cut it.

32:40.558 --> 32:43.161
So, top shelf or hooch?

32:43.227 --> 32:45.229
Hooch, I think.

32:45.296 --> 32:49.167
Saurian brandy it is.

32:49.233 --> 32:51.035
Come on.

32:52.370 --> 32:55.707
It's not as if
I haven't loved before.

32:55.773 --> 32:57.508
I have.

32:57.575 --> 33:01.279
Sometimes quite deeply.

33:01.346 --> 33:04.382
Yes, but always with those
who would only be temporary.

33:04.449 --> 33:06.184
That's not entirely true.

33:06.250 --> 33:08.086
So that you'd never
have to fear

33:08.152 --> 33:09.420
any of them taking root.

33:09.487 --> 33:13.024
You think I'm the fearful sort?

33:13.091 --> 33:15.526
Oh, no. I think you've done
a great many,

33:15.593 --> 33:19.530
many brave things, of a kind.

33:19.597 --> 33:21.132
It's too late.

33:21.199 --> 33:24.769
That particular ship
has sailed.

33:24.836 --> 33:27.538
I watched it go.

33:27.605 --> 33:31.275
Jean-Luc, you're being
ridiculous.

33:31.342 --> 33:34.345
-Excuse me?
-Yeah, it's not too late.

33:34.412 --> 33:38.216
The problem isn't time.
It's you.

33:38.282 --> 33:41.552
You always talk about love
as if you ever

33:41.619 --> 33:43.354
took it seriously.

33:44.188 --> 33:47.158
And you know the only things
you've ever put out there

33:47.225 --> 33:48.793
to break were your bones.

33:48.860 --> 33:52.163
And the only thing you ever
risked losing was your life.

33:52.230 --> 33:54.565
That's not an
insignificant loss.

33:54.632 --> 33:57.235
There are worse things
than being dead.

33:57.301 --> 34:00.505
You know that better
than anybody.

34:02.573 --> 34:06.210
You've been on your own
for, what, nearly a century?

34:06.277 --> 34:08.246
Why? What's holding you back?

34:11.249 --> 34:13.351
Okay, why did you decide

34:13.418 --> 34:15.586
to go to the stars
in the first place?

34:15.653 --> 34:19.257
We've discussed this
so many times.

34:19.323 --> 34:21.826
To explore, to meet
new civilizations...

34:21.893 --> 34:23.795
Jean-Luc,
since I've known you,

34:23.861 --> 34:27.498
the only place you have ever
been afraid to explore,

34:27.565 --> 34:32.069
be it flesh and blood,
or an artificial synthetic,

34:32.136 --> 34:34.272
is in here.

34:37.675 --> 34:40.144
(sighs)

34:40.211 --> 34:42.113
What happened in there

34:42.180 --> 34:45.149
that you and I have
never talked about?

34:50.354 --> 34:52.356
(sighs)

34:55.560 --> 34:57.495
(Guinan sighs sharply)

34:57.562 --> 35:01.199
You know what?
I understand.

35:02.233 --> 35:05.570
I think your answers

35:05.636 --> 35:08.573
are not in the stars,
and they never have been.

35:11.175 --> 35:14.579
Also, I suggest that we drink.

35:17.648 --> 35:21.219
Because I think there's
one final frontier

35:21.285 --> 35:23.421
yet to come.

35:29.260 --> 35:30.394
(laughs)

35:30.461 --> 35:31.529
(Picard exhales)

35:38.369 --> 35:41.305
WHITLEY:
Sorry to drop in on you
like this, Jean-Luc,

35:41.372 --> 35:43.574
but it's a sensitive matter.

35:43.641 --> 35:46.143
What is it, Sally?

35:46.210 --> 35:47.712
Please make yourself
comfortable.

35:50.715 --> 35:54.151
We've encountered something
unique in space.

35:54.218 --> 35:57.421
We'd like to get
your eyes on it in person.

35:58.489 --> 36:01.626
Oh. With all due respect,
Admiral,

36:01.692 --> 36:04.295
there must be dozens
of better qualified people

36:04.362 --> 36:05.363
than myself.

36:09.367 --> 36:12.703
Its event horizon caused
a massive spike

36:12.770 --> 36:15.172
in Adler-Lasky
temporal radiation.

36:15.239 --> 36:19.176
And then it began...

36:19.243 --> 36:21.646
well, to broadcast.

36:21.712 --> 36:25.316
(overlapping distorted voices)

36:25.383 --> 36:27.184
This is how it begins.

36:27.251 --> 36:30.288
Help us, Picard.

36:30.354 --> 36:33.424
Help us,
Picard.

36:35.693 --> 36:37.728
Help us, Picard.

36:37.795 --> 36:40.298
You said how it began?

36:40.364 --> 36:44.602
The balance of the message is
the entirety of Article 15.

36:44.669 --> 36:48.472
Article 15. An entreaty
to join the Federation.

36:48.539 --> 36:51.976
An unknown entity that can
open and close

36:52.043 --> 36:53.578
a hole in space-time

36:53.644 --> 36:57.415
wants to join the Federation,
and apparently

36:57.481 --> 36:59.817
will only talk to you about it.

37:09.694 --> 37:11.696
♪ ♪

37:36.854 --> 37:38.756
Jean-Luc?

37:38.823 --> 37:42.259
(shuttle departing)

38:09.720 --> 38:13.491
Well, this is
an unexpected encounter.

38:13.557 --> 38:16.293
Indeed. Dr. Jurati's
here as well.

38:16.360 --> 38:17.895
Oh.

38:19.597 --> 38:20.831
CREWMAN (quietly):
It's Admiral Picard.

38:20.898 --> 38:22.833
Your reputation precedes you.

38:22.900 --> 38:26.504
Well, the Stargazer was
my first command.

38:26.570 --> 38:30.408
Uh, not this Stargazer,
of course.

38:30.474 --> 38:33.911
But being here...

38:35.479 --> 38:36.814
...it feels like

38:36.881 --> 38:39.750
my life has come full circle.

38:40.751 --> 38:43.754
She is quite a ship.

38:45.756 --> 38:47.725
You don't agree?

38:47.792 --> 38:49.593
(Seven of Nine sighs)

38:49.660 --> 38:53.064
The Stargazer is the first
of a new class of ship

38:53.130 --> 38:55.766
that utilizes components
derived from research

38:55.833 --> 38:57.535
on the Borg cube artifact.

38:57.601 --> 38:59.737
Yes, of course.
That's right.

38:59.804 --> 39:02.339
There are so many in Starfleet
who fear the Borg,

39:02.406 --> 39:06.844
and I sense that my presence
is increasing

39:06.911 --> 39:10.548
historic tensions and paranoia.

39:20.558 --> 39:22.493
Admiral on the bridge!

39:22.560 --> 39:24.562
(boatswain's whistle sounds)

39:25.930 --> 39:28.532
Chris.

39:28.599 --> 39:31.435
-It's so good to see you.
-You, too.

39:32.436 --> 39:34.138
Welcome to the Stargazer.

39:34.205 --> 39:37.575
Oh, thank you.

39:37.641 --> 39:38.843
Oh, please, as you were.

39:42.880 --> 39:45.850
Well...

39:47.518 --> 39:51.155
...this is certainly sleeker
than my Stargazer.

39:51.222 --> 39:54.592
The older these refits get,
the younger they look.

39:54.658 --> 39:55.726
Unlike myself.

39:55.793 --> 39:59.830
Well, mister, I think you look
absolutely positronic.

39:59.897 --> 40:02.933
Agnes, I'm delighted to see you.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.602
Circumstances notwithstanding.

40:06.470 --> 40:08.973
-Status.
-Tactical, enhance.

40:15.780 --> 40:19.750
Well, let's see if they have
anything else

40:19.817 --> 40:21.719
to say to me personally.

40:21.786 --> 40:23.154
Uh, if I may, Captain?

40:23.220 --> 40:24.855
Knock yourself out.

40:24.922 --> 40:27.892
Lieutenant,
all hailing frequencies.

40:29.794 --> 40:32.596
This is Admiral Jean-Luc Picard

40:32.663 --> 40:34.465
responding to your request.

40:44.775 --> 40:47.745
I repeat, this is
Admiral Jean-Luc...

40:47.812 --> 40:48.979
LEGION:
Picard!

40:49.046 --> 40:51.782
(static whooshing)

40:55.653 --> 40:57.221
Picard!

40:57.288 --> 40:59.523
Energy spiking across the board.

40:59.990 --> 41:02.660
-Something's coming through.
-I can see that.

41:02.726 --> 41:05.196
Red alert!
Helm, back off.

41:05.262 --> 41:07.598
Give us some distance.

41:07.665 --> 41:10.534
(alarm blaring)

41:16.006 --> 41:17.875
(grunts)

41:45.002 --> 41:46.637
Seven?

41:48.005 --> 41:50.941
Yes, Admiral.

41:51.008 --> 41:53.010
That ship is Borg.

42:03.988 --> 42:05.990
(alarm blaring)

42:13.597 --> 42:15.532
Stargazer,
this is Commander Musiker.

42:15.599 --> 42:17.067
Excelsior is standing by,
ready to assist.

42:17.134 --> 42:19.103
RIOS:
Good to know you're there, Raf.

42:19.937 --> 42:23.607
Well, Admiral, right now
we're the tip of the spear,

42:23.674 --> 42:24.708
you're the ranking officer,

42:24.775 --> 42:27.011
and the devil
is calling your name.

42:27.077 --> 42:29.813
I'm fairly certain that
if we don't act, they will. So,

42:29.880 --> 42:31.949
what do we do?

42:32.016 --> 42:34.818
I don't know.

42:34.885 --> 42:36.887
That out there

42:36.954 --> 42:39.957
could be the very point

42:40.024 --> 42:43.060
at which history turns.

42:43.127 --> 42:44.828
SEVEN OF NINE:
Picard.

42:44.895 --> 42:46.830
The Borg consume.

42:46.897 --> 42:48.565
They assimilate.

42:48.632 --> 42:51.302
They don't ask
to be assimilated.

42:51.368 --> 42:53.570
Dr. Jurati?

42:54.972 --> 42:56.840
I think caution is warranted,

42:56.907 --> 43:00.077
b-but everything about this
is unique.

43:00.144 --> 43:01.845
The Borg we know have been

43:01.912 --> 43:04.715
effectively decimated,
functionally hobbled.

43:04.782 --> 43:06.583
So wouldn't it stand to reason

43:06.650 --> 43:08.085
-that they'd change tactics?
-SEVEN OF NINE: Absolutely.

43:08.152 --> 43:10.788
Victory through
whatever means necessary.

43:10.854 --> 43:12.589
And in the absence of strength,

43:12.656 --> 43:13.791
deception.

43:13.857 --> 43:15.326
JURATI:
But we could be putting a bullet

43:15.392 --> 43:17.795
into the greatest ally
the Federation may ever know.

43:17.861 --> 43:18.929
PICARD:
Precisely.

43:19.830 --> 43:23.133
(chuckles): I don't believe
what I'm hearing.

43:23.200 --> 43:26.637
The Borg have wiped out
entire races.

43:26.704 --> 43:28.672
Killed tens of millions,
including my parents.

43:28.739 --> 43:30.140
Subjugated exponentially more.

43:30.207 --> 43:31.976
Yes, I understand.

43:32.042 --> 43:33.811
SEVEN OF NINE:
I know this sounds cold,
but just hear me out.

43:33.877 --> 43:35.946
If I'm wrong,
we destroy a Borg ship.

43:36.013 --> 43:39.016
But if I'm right
and we do nothing,

43:39.083 --> 43:43.187
then today is the beginning
of the end of the Federation.

43:47.992 --> 43:49.994
MOSHE (over comm):
Captain Rios to the bridge.

43:52.763 --> 43:54.765
SING:
Sir, they're hailing us.

43:54.832 --> 43:56.400
Let's hear it.

43:56.467 --> 43:58.702
LEGION:
There is no more time.

43:58.769 --> 44:00.938
We will begin negotiation

44:01.005 --> 44:02.940
with Picard alone.

44:03.007 --> 44:05.376
And how do you propose
to do that?

44:05.442 --> 44:07.778
We will send an emissary.

44:07.845 --> 44:11.081
We will offer our queen.

44:13.450 --> 44:14.852
There's no way in hell

44:14.918 --> 44:16.820
I'm letting them
on board this ship.

44:18.922 --> 44:20.190
Broadcast fleetwide:

44:20.257 --> 44:21.959
-Shields up.
-SING: Aye, Captain.

44:42.980 --> 44:45.449
Sir, we have
an incoming transport signal.

44:45.516 --> 44:47.217
Signal scans
indicate a single life-form.

44:47.284 --> 44:49.720
Organic-synthetic components
consistent with the Borg.

44:50.954 --> 44:53.690
Captain, do we fire?

44:53.757 --> 44:55.926
Not yet. They can't transport
through our shields.

44:55.993 --> 44:57.161
The queen is actually coming.

44:57.227 --> 45:01.065
Rios, don't wait
until it's too late. Fire.

45:02.533 --> 45:03.967
Open a channel.

45:05.235 --> 45:07.938
-SING: Channel open, Captain.
-Borg vessel,

45:08.005 --> 45:09.740
cease transport attempt,

45:09.807 --> 45:12.009
or you will be fired upon.

45:24.788 --> 45:26.090
MOSHE:
Sir, her transport signal

45:26.156 --> 45:27.858
is penetrating our shields.

45:27.925 --> 45:30.127
-What deck?
-Here, sir. The bridge.

45:30.194 --> 45:33.230
Hand phasers at the ready.
Moshe,

45:33.297 --> 45:34.498
do not engage prematurely.

45:34.565 --> 45:35.866
Yes, sir.

45:35.933 --> 45:37.234
Security team to the bridge.

45:40.170 --> 45:41.505
MAN (over P.A.):
All security teams, report

45:41.572 --> 45:43.907
to the bridge immediately.

45:43.974 --> 45:45.275
(alarm blaring)

46:06.597 --> 46:08.365
That's new.

46:16.907 --> 46:19.843
BORG QUEEN:
We wish for peace.

46:24.915 --> 46:26.283
But first,

46:26.350 --> 46:28.852
we require...

46:33.023 --> 46:34.324
What?

46:34.391 --> 46:36.994
What do you require?

46:37.995 --> 46:39.897
BORG QUEEN:
Power.

46:57.614 --> 46:59.116
(grunts)

47:19.169 --> 47:20.904
Cease fire!

47:23.240 --> 47:25.042
Stop firing!

47:27.444 --> 47:29.947
The queen is stunning them,
not killing them.

47:30.013 --> 47:31.315
Stop firing!

47:32.950 --> 47:34.918
COMPUTER:
Isolinear fragmentation
detected.

47:34.985 --> 47:37.054
Command node corruption.
