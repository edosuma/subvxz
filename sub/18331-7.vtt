on Rock Band?

Yes.

Now all we need is Gia.

03:42.472 --> 03:43.848
Gia? Ew!

03:45.892 --> 03:48.519
She was such a bad influence on Stephanie.

03:49.229 --> 03:53.358
She tried to get you to smoke cigarettes
and she took you to a makeout party

03:53.441 --> 03:57.320
and, worst of all, she talked you
into wearing your very first crop top.

04:00.281 --> 04:02.575
It so happens
that I'm Facebook friends with Gia.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.452

He said "Girl talk." It's a sign!

05:03.428 --> 05:05.722

05:14.731 --> 05:17.442
So, are we getting
the band back together or what?

05:18.609 --> 05:20.278
It sounds like a terrible idea.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.363

06:05.656 --> 06:07.158

06:07.617 --> 06:09.786
They said they wanted to be free-range.

06:11.537 --> 06:13.664
And I stupidly said, "OK."

06:15.500 --> 06:18.628
And now my project's going to be a loser.

06:19.087 --> 06:19.962
So am I.

Did I give up?

06:50.952 --> 06:51.786
Never.

so many cars crashed

07:01.671 --> 07:03.089

07:04.799 --> 07:07.552

and share a Cinnabon?

You're a little punk.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.926
You posted this video
just because I broke into your locker?

12:41.010 --> 12:42.845
-What are you talking about?
-This.

12:49.768 --> 12:53.397
Jackson, I thought you were a nice guy,
but you're a jerk!

12:53.481 --> 12:54.773
I didn't do that!

12:54.857 --> 12:56.567
I couldn't even if I wanted to.

12:56.650 --> 12:58.027
I'm not tech savvy.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.654
I used to think that WiFi was a question.

13:03.365 --> 13:06.619
I know you're lying, but whatever.
I'm not gonna let this affect me.

13:06.702 --> 13:08.412
Where are you going?

13:08.496 --> 13:09.955
To my room for the rest of my life.

13:10.581 --> 13:11.499
I'll go with you.

13:11.582 --> 13:15.711
Not for the rest of your life,
but at least until my cello lesson.

13:18.547 --> 13:21.467
And Jackson,
to think that once upon a time,

13:21.550 --> 13:25.596
I actually almost considered
sorta kinda maybe liking you a little.

13:29.350 --> 13:30.392
Take down that video.

13:31.393 --> 13:33.687
-What are you talking about?
-I know you did it.

13:33.771 --> 13:35.648
You didn't like it
when Ramona shot you down.

13:36.315 --> 13:37.858
You can't prove anything.

13:37.942 --> 13:42.196
You were in the bathroom with your phone
for way too long.

13:44.031 --> 13:48.702
Hey, I wash my hands thoroughly.
It's flu season.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.165
What a waste of time.

13:54.375 --> 13:57.086
My crops will never grow back in time.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.171
I'm doomed.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.341
You're not doomed.

14:03.342 --> 14:06.470
In the words
of Bruce The Boss Springsteen,

14:06.554 --> 14:08.889
"Baby, you were born to farm."

14:11.141 --> 14:13.561
In the words of me,
"I need a miracle."

14:15.813 --> 14:16.939
Ah!

14:17.022 --> 14:22.611
That is why you should water your crops
with this magic potion.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.572
That's just hose water.

14:27.241 --> 14:30.911
You do realize you're talking to
the valedictorian of Second Grade?

14:32.955 --> 14:35.249
Yes, you put a bumper sticker on my car.

14:37.960 --> 14:41.171
And now, I am adding a secret ingredient.

14:41.881 --> 14:46.552
Do you swear on your life, never
to reveal the contents of this bottle?

14:47.344 --> 14:49.889
Why does everything have to be
a production with you?

14:51.640 --> 14:53.976
Behold, young Max,

14:54.643 --> 14:56.353
the tears of a unicorn.

15:00.232 --> 15:01.692
Give me a break.

15:03.819 --> 15:05.988
We all know unicorns are real,

15:06.071 --> 15:09.742
but you're saying someone
collected and bottled their tears?

15:12.494 --> 15:14.246
That seems far-fetched.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.000
OK, don't use them.

15:18.834 --> 15:20.127
Because they only work

15:20.711 --> 15:21.629
if you believe.

15:25.049 --> 15:26.967
Meh, what have a I got to lose?

15:43.692 --> 15:45.945
Before I say good night,
I just wanna tell you,

15:46.028 --> 15:49.782
there's a very real chance I'm embarking
on a world tour with Girl Talk.

15:51.867 --> 15:53.786
That's great, Mom. Can I come with you?

15:54.662 --> 15:56.080
I will need an entourage.

15:57.498 --> 16:00.167

throw itself in the pool.

I'm so sorry, honey. Who did this?

16:19.895 --> 16:21.855
[sighs] I don't wanna talk about it.

16:21.939 --> 16:23.774
I'm the joke of my school.

16:25.651 --> 16:26.944
I know how you feel.

16:27.027 --> 16:29.989
This may be hard to believe,
but when I was your age

16:30.072 --> 16:33.158
I was picked on just for having
my own special sense of style.

16:35.202 --> 16:36.328
No, I can see that.

16:40.874 --> 16:43.544
But Mom, when you were a kid,
there was no social media.

16:43.627 --> 16:46.338
My hippo thing is going to be
on the Internet forever.

16:47.047 --> 16:48.966
But is the Internet really gonna stick?

16:50.884 --> 16:52.970
Look, you can't give whoever did this

16:53.053 --> 16:55.639
the power to make you
feel bad about yourself.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.599
You are Ramona Gibbler.

16:57.683 --> 17:02.104
Dancer, artist, straight-B student,
if you take out Algebra.

17:04.189 --> 17:05.107
Mom.

17:05.983 --> 17:09.695
I know this feels like the worst thing
in the world right now,

17:10.404 --> 17:12.573
but every day it will hurt a little less,

17:12.656 --> 17:14.324
until you can barely feel it.

17:15.325 --> 17:18.245
Then new things will happen
that will hurt you even more.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.585
Just know that whatever happens,

17:24.668 --> 17:27.671
you and I will get through this
and everything else together.

17:30.007 --> 17:31.091
Thanks, Mom.

17:31.800 --> 17:34.011
You know, some of that
was actually helpful.

17:39.975 --> 17:41.727
Don't get your hopes up, Cosmo.

17:42.895 --> 17:46.356
I Googled "Farming miracles
due to unicorn tears,"

17:46.440 --> 17:48.317
zero results.

17:50.110 --> 17:53.322
Then I Googled Blake Shelton,
just to cheer myself up.

17:54.823 --> 17:55.741
Come on, Cosmo.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.995

18:26.063 --> 18:29.191
Oh, Mylanta, what is this?

18:30.234 --> 18:32.694
Mom, look what I grew in one night.

18:34.613 --> 18:37.866
Wow, that is one big carrot!

18:38.575 --> 18:40.911
And it already has
an organic sticker on it!

18:48.836 --> 18:49.920
Of course it does.

18:51.630 --> 18:54.466

are ready for market.

about you at the family meetings.

replanting Max's farm.

19:15.195 --> 19:16.572
There were family meetings?

19:18.574 --> 19:21.577
The point is,
you made a little boy very happy.

19:21.660 --> 19:24.705
Well, sometimes he does push my buttons,
but deep down,

19:24.788 --> 19:27.666
