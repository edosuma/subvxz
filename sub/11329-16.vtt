00:00.993 --> 00:03.460
<i>Previously on The Secret Life
of the American Teenager</i>

00:03.496 --> 00:05.796
- How are you feeling?
- I'm feeling really happy.

00:06.357 --> 00:08.143
You both look happy.

00:08.144 --> 00:10.391
Oh, we get to find out the sex
of the baby today.

00:10.833 --> 00:12.900
- So it's "we," huh?
- Yep.

00:13.136 --> 00:16.169
I'm ready to have sex with you.
Maybe you should go get tested.

00:16.206 --> 00:18.173
I just need to get some forms
for homeschooling.

00:18.571 --> 00:19.404
Oh, I love homeschooling.

00:20.455 --> 00:22.821
Do you have someone to act
as your teacher at home?

00:22.931 --> 00:25.198
Oh, I don't need a teacher.
I'm gonna do it myself.

00:25.238 --> 00:26.576
I'm sorry. What?

00:26.677 --> 00:28.505
I met him at work,
and we just clicked.

00:28.595 --> 00:30.729
- What is up with you?
- People who meet in high school

00:30.731 --> 00:32.482
don't always stay together.

00:32.484 --> 00:33.097
I got it.

00:33.729 --> 00:36.096
I really hate that you were there for
Amy, but you don't wanna be here for me.

00:36.444 --> 00:37.507
So I wanna go out with him.

00:37.540 --> 00:38.976
You never mentioned
him all summer.

00:39.049 --> 00:40.849
- He was my boss.
- I think 20's a little old.

00:40.920 --> 00:42.952
You're gonna love him. You
just have to give him a chance.

00:42.953 --> 00:45.786
I'm just not gonna get tested.
I don't have anything.

00:46.963 --> 00:48.729
It wouldn't hurt to get tested.

00:51.409 --> 00:53.109
Tell us.
It's a girl.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.878
It's a girl, it's a girl, it's a girl!

00:56.669 --> 00:57.336
Hi, honey. I'm home.

01:02.556 --> 01:04.989
So, that's the deal.
My mom is out of jail.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.400
Hmm. And you're
telling me this because...

01:10.344 --> 01:12.510
Because you granted me
the privilege

01:12.546 --> 01:14.646
of having my son in my home
on weekends,

01:14.647 --> 01:16.747
and I don't wanna lose
the privilege.

01:16.802 --> 01:19.169
I assume I'm not supposed
to be living with an ex-con.

01:19.171 --> 01:21.904
Or an ex-con is not supposed
to be living with me,

01:22.536 --> 01:23.370
even if she is my mother.

01:23.449 --> 01:25.482
So, Ricky, what you're
really looking for,

01:25.487 --> 01:28.754
by telling me that your mom
showed up and is at your apartment,

01:29.787 --> 01:30.520
is not only to protect

01:31.358 --> 01:33.058
your arrangement
with Amy and John,

01:33.093 --> 01:35.160
but you're also looking
for me to tell you

01:35.197 --> 01:37.430
that your mom has to
get out of your apartment,

01:37.597 --> 01:39.997
because you don't want her
to live there anymore.

01:40.008 --> 01:42.108
You want her out
by some order of authority...

01:42.937 --> 01:43.770
that authority being me...

01:43.773 --> 01:47.473
because her living there is not
the best thing for you and your son.

01:47.563 --> 01:48.863
Yeah. Yes, sir.

01:49.565 --> 01:50.398
Let me see what I can do.

01:52.090 --> 01:54.290
Do you know the name
of her parole officer?

01:54.832 --> 01:55.499
Yeah.

01:55.631 --> 01:57.931
I wrote down the information
for you.

01:59.265 --> 02:00.265
Thank you.

02:01.205 --> 02:02.571
All right.
I'll make a call.

02:03.441 --> 02:06.008
But, um, it's just too bad

02:06.742 --> 02:07.609
that we can't find someone

02:08.011 --> 02:09.978
to help turn your mom's
life around.

02:09.979 --> 02:11.810
You know, the same way
that your adopted

02:11.811 --> 02:13.284
parents turned your life around.

02:15.179 --> 02:16.212
Sometimes parents need parents,

02:19.096 --> 02:21.496
and sometimes the child
has to become the parent.

02:23.923 --> 02:26.323
Not me.
I can't do that.

02:31.621 --> 02:33.421
Hang on, hang on.
I'm coming already.

02:35.954 --> 02:36.954
Is Ricky home?

02:38.026 --> 02:40.326
Are you Amy?

02:41.874 --> 02:42.874
Yes, I'm Amy.

02:45.538 --> 02:46.305
Are you Ricky's mother?

02:47.337 --> 02:49.637
- You look just like him.
- You look just like me.

02:51.731 --> 02:54.164
I mean, it's like
looking in a mirror.

02:54.171 --> 02:56.671
I mean, before I was
into alcohol and drugs

02:58.023 --> 02:58.756
and, well, guys and...

02:58.888 --> 03:00.755
Yeah, I was much younger.
Look.

03:02.289 --> 03:02.755
Huh? I mean...

03:02.756 --> 03:05.190
Wow, this is really
kind of sick.

03:06.696 --> 03:07.829
My son is dating his mother.

03:09.230 --> 03:10.530
Not dating. Worse.

03:10.834 --> 03:11.834
Come in.

03:12.336 --> 03:13.269
Please.

03:15.070 --> 03:15.870
Um...

03:16.344 --> 03:18.044
I... I didn't know
that you were...

03:18.210 --> 03:20.043
Oh. Out of jail?
"Yah."

03:20.814 --> 03:23.581
Yeah, I got out yesterday
and showed up last night.

03:25.519 --> 03:27.686
Wow, my good son
is in love with a girl

03:27.687 --> 03:29.381
who looks like
his mother at 17.

03:29.382 --> 03:31.216
I can't get over it.

03:32.621 --> 03:34.054
Yeah.
Come on. Sit down.

03:35.125 --> 03:36.758
I... I can't.
I have to get to school.

03:36.759 --> 03:39.700
I dropped John off at the nursery
a little early this morning.

03:39.701 --> 03:41.868
Thought I'd surprise Ricky
and drop by.

03:43.533 --> 03:44.366
Oh, he... he left already.

03:44.367 --> 03:47.404
What, you thought you'd surprise
him, or you thought you'd catch him?

03:48.573 --> 03:49.240
I think I better go.

03:50.044 --> 03:51.878
Oh, no, no.
I wish you'd stay.

03:53.313 --> 03:54.146
I really wish you'd stay.

03:55.150 --> 03:57.350
I've been dying to meet you.
Just dying to meet you.

03:57.414 --> 03:59.781
Of course, I wasn't
expecting me, but...

04:00.855 --> 04:02.422
I really have to go.

04:04.322 --> 04:05.122
Okay. If you have to go.

04:05.726 --> 04:07.626
I guess school's
important, too.

04:08.993 --> 04:09.993
Yeah, school's very important.

04:11.298 --> 04:12.098
It was nice meeting you.

04:13.433 --> 04:14.133
Nora. My name's Nora.

04:14.134 --> 04:15.968
You know what?
Before you go,

04:17.470 --> 04:18.170
could I just ask you,

04:19.505 --> 04:20.406
do you mind if I meet John?

04:21.607 --> 04:22.440
I really wanna meet John.

04:23.778 --> 04:26.745
Uh, if Ricky says it's okay,
then, yeah, of course it's okay.

04:27.744 --> 04:28.678
I mean, John's his son, too.

04:29.778 --> 04:30.578
Great.

04:31.151 --> 04:33.251
So, if I get my
18-year-old son's permission,

04:33.252 --> 04:34.918
then I get to meet my grandson?

04:35.721 --> 04:37.921
Yeah, I think it has to be
his decision.

04:38.558 --> 04:39.358
I don't really know you.

04:40.562 --> 04:42.662
Then you should get to know me.

04:44.265 --> 04:46.299
Come on. Please stay.
Please?

04:48.130 --> 04:50.196
I will tell you Ricky stories.

04:50.203 --> 04:53.336
Come on. What are they gonna
teach you at school today

04:53.377 --> 04:55.344
that's better
than Ricky stories?

04:57.380 --> 04:58.680
<i>Falling in love</i>

05:00.666 --> 05:02.300
<i>Is such an easy thing to do</i>

05:03.575 --> 05:05.241
<i>Birds can do it We can do it</i>

05:06.741 --> 05:07.718
<i>Let's stop talking</i>

05:07.719 --> 05:08.641
<i>Let's get to it</i>

05:09.323 --> 05:09.923
<i>Let's fall in love</i>

05:15.223 --> 05:17.157
- It won't last.
- It might.

05:17.158 --> 05:17.712
It won't.

05:17.713 --> 05:19.927
You know, I've done
some research,

05:19.928 --> 05:21.546
<i>and as it turns
out, some teenagers</i>

05:21.547 --> 05:23.298
actually do better with
homeschooling.

05:23.568 --> 05:25.634
Ashley might thrive
in homeschooling.

05:25.635 --> 05:27.154
You're just gonna have
to let her see how

05:27.155 --> 05:28.672
she likes it and see
if it works for her.

05:28.673 --> 05:29.968
It's not gonna work for
her, and she's not

05:29.969 --> 05:31.172
even gonna try to
make it work for her.

05:31.210 --> 05:33.677
She's only doing this
because you told her she could.

05:34.409 --> 05:35.375
Well, you told her she could.

05:35.614 --> 05:37.481
Only because you
told her she could.

05:38.446 --> 05:39.480
Well, she wants to do it, so...

05:39.878 --> 05:42.112
So, the question is,
why does she wanna do it?

05:43.285 --> 05:44.818
I don't think there is a "why."

05:44.890 --> 05:46.690
She wants to
'cause she wants to.

05:46.691 --> 05:48.924
It's something different to do,
and teenagers like being different.

05:48.960 --> 05:51.060
I don't like teenagers
being different.

05:51.411 --> 05:53.479
I want her to be the same as
everyone else and go to school.

05:53.531 --> 05:55.531
Well, you're gonna
have to tell her that then.

05:55.616 --> 05:56.349
I can't tell her that.

05:57.079 --> 05:58.712
I used to be the good cop
to your bad cop,

05:58.774 --> 06:00.474
and now you've decided
to be the good cop, too.

06:00.678 --> 06:02.345
<i>She has no discipline
in her life.</i>

06:02.423 --> 06:03.682
One of us has to say no
to her, and it can't

06:03.683 --> 06:04.913
be me, because I'm the
one living with her.

06:04.960 --> 06:07.327
No, it has to be you, because
you're the one living with her.

06:07.826 --> 06:09.795
<i>Besides, you're the one who
thinks that she shouldn't do it.</i>

06:09.961 --> 06:12.327
So you tell her no.
I think it could work.

06:12.566 --> 06:16.536
It can't work. She has no discipline,
no motivation, and no mommy.

06:18.002 --> 06:18.969
This is broken homeschooling.

06:19.138 --> 06:20.971
Living with
two teenage daughters

06:21.806 --> 06:23.772
isn't as easy
as you thought it would be?

06:25.243 --> 06:27.176
Lauren, you have to
go to school.

06:27.177 --> 06:29.880
I can't. I can't go to
school. I don't wanna see him.

06:29.881 --> 06:32.448
Well, maybe if you see him,
he'll change his mind.

06:32.785 --> 06:34.519
I don't care
if he changes his mind

06:34.556 --> 06:36.556
after he's already
broken my heart.

06:37.133 --> 06:40.057
And what difference does it
make if he changes his mind?

06:40.058 --> 06:41.904
I'll never feel the
same about him.

06:42.305 --> 06:43.205
Well, what do you wanna do?

06:44.475 --> 06:46.675
I just want to stay in bed.
I'm sick.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.206
No, you aren't. Not really.
Not sick sick.

06:49.352 --> 06:53.489
I know. I'm worse than sick.
I'm practically dead.

06:54.131 --> 06:55.098
Well, I have to go to school.

06:55.153 --> 06:57.120
I hate to leave you here dead,
but I have to go to school.

06:58.762 --> 07:00.396
Why? Why can't you stay with me?

07:00.699 --> 07:02.999
Our parents are working.
They won't know.

07:04.128 --> 07:05.028
I don't wanna be by myself.

07:05.029 --> 07:08.233
Well, yeah, but, you know,
we just got off restriction,

07:09.271 --> 07:09.704
and I just...

07:09.705 --> 07:11.875
I feel like we should go.
I mean, we should go.

07:13.877 --> 07:14.877
Oh. I know what this is about.

07:15.678 --> 07:16.411
This is about Stanley.

07:17.646 --> 07:18.313
Well, yeah, kind of.

07:18.316 --> 07:20.249
I mean, he's supposed
to meet my dad tonight.

07:22.585 --> 07:26.154
Then just go without me then.
Just go without me.

07:27.286 --> 07:28.053
I'm not going. I can't.

07:29.691 --> 07:30.991
Okay. I'll ask.

07:31.423 --> 07:32.190
If I don't ask, then...

07:35.129 --> 07:36.729
Madison?

07:37.100 --> 07:38.534
Hey, Dad.

07:38.802 --> 07:39.735
I need to ask you something.

07:40.803 --> 07:41.236
Okay. Ask me.

07:41.267 --> 07:43.300
But if you wanna ask me
if you can date Jack again,

07:44.171 --> 07:45.738
I told you,
you can date Jack again.

07:46.044 --> 07:48.043
Oh, no. I want you
to meet Stanley tonight.

07:48.044 --> 07:50.978
Stanley's coming over tonight.
You didn't forget, did you?

07:51.911 --> 07:52.578
No, I didn't forget.

07:54.483 --> 07:56.653
Well, uh, Lauren isn't
gonna go to school today

07:56.654 --> 07:59.187
'cause Jesse broke up with her,
and she's really upset.

07:59.188 --> 08:01.489
- So can I stay with her?
- And miss school? No.

08:01.490 --> 08:03.115
Madison, you have to
go to school, and you

08:03.116 --> 08:04.627
should get Lauren to
go to school, too.

08:05.327 --> 08:06.260
<i>I mean, these things happen.</i>

08:06.295 --> 08:08.364
Teenagers break up,
they get back together,

08:08.365 --> 08:10.432
they break up again,
they get back together again.

08:10.433 --> 08:12.733
This doesn't mean that
it's over for her and Jesse.

08:13.003 --> 08:15.170
This doesn't even mean
that it's over for you and Jack.

08:15.205 --> 08:17.405
Oh, no, things are over
for me and Jack.

08:18.838 --> 08:19.838
Go to school.

08:22.748 --> 08:25.115
I don't think Jesse
meant to break up with Lauren.

08:25.558 --> 08:28.291
- I think it just happened.
- That's between the two of them.

08:29.659 --> 08:31.559
This is between the...
three of us.

08:31.560 --> 08:34.496
I really think that this is
an opportunity for you, Jack.

08:34.498 --> 08:36.198
Lauren is gonna be
at home today.

08:36.198 --> 08:38.635
Madison is gonna be without
her best friend at school.

08:38.673 --> 08:41.173
This is your opportunity
to get back in the game, son.

08:42.504 --> 08:43.504
And when you back in the game,

08:44.241 --> 08:46.209
just remember what
the rules of the game are.

08:47.579 --> 08:48.579
Yes, sir.

08:48.748 --> 08:51.248
But is there any kind
of compromising on that?

08:52.017 --> 08:53.717
No. Got it.

08:53.859 --> 08:55.159
Have a nice day.

09:02.091 --> 09:03.991
Where are you?

09:03.992 --> 09:07.096
Oh, I just finished my
conversation with Madison's dad.

09:07.995 --> 09:09.028
Hey, is Grace dropping you off?

09:09.029 --> 09:10.664
I texted Grace to drop you off.

09:10.067 --> 09:12.034
If I drop you off,
you'll be late.

09:12.498 --> 09:14.764
I'm vice president.
I can't be late.

09:15.236 --> 09:17.036
I know, Tom.
Do you want me to call Grace?

09:18.674 --> 09:19.041
I call her.

09:19.109 --> 09:21.475
She's not going to do
anything for you.

09:22.742 --> 09:23.742
She hates you!

09:29.219 --> 09:31.152
Hello?

09:32.524 --> 09:34.857
Hello. Why are you talking
on your phone?

09:35.591 --> 09:38.424
Because you were calling me
just as I was walking in.

09:38.892 --> 09:39.392
It's not funny.

09:39.630 --> 09:41.330
Yes, it is.
It's hysterical.

09:41.531 --> 09:43.897
If you're in a good mood,
it's hysterical.

09:43.898 --> 09:45.931
I, myself, am not
in a good mood,

09:46.269 --> 09:48.235
otherwise I'd
be laughing hysterically.

09:49.139 --> 09:49.872
I need a ride to work.

09:50.371 --> 09:52.704
I know. Jack texted me.
I'll take you.

09:54.641 --> 09:55.441
Thanks.

09:56.879 --> 09:59.012
So where is Mr. Irresponsible?
Why can't he take you?

10:00.466 --> 10:00.899
I never tell.

10:00.998 --> 10:03.931
I don't really care. I just need
to tell Adrian what I'm doing.

10:04.295 --> 10:05.295
Make it quick.

10:11.346 --> 10:12.179
Hey, are you on your way?

10:12.079 --> 10:13.415
Yeah. I need to drop Tom off.
Do you wanna come?

10:13.716 --> 10:16.049
No. We're gonna be late
if we drop Tom off.

10:16.050 --> 10:17.180
You know, you're right.

10:17.181 --> 10:19.586
Maybe we should just
forget about it for today.

10:20.254 --> 10:21.887
- You wanna ditch?
- No. Do you?

10:22.519 --> 10:23.519
Yeah, I do.

10:23.788 --> 10:24.455
School just started.

10:25.326 --> 10:26.059
We can't ditch school.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.527
We could. And, you know,
school just started,

10:28.528 --> 10:30.895
so there's probably
not that much stuff going on.

10:30.896 --> 10:33.232
- What is wrong with you?
- Nothing.

10:34.237 --> 10:36.904
Oh, just go get the test,
if that's what Grant wants.

10:37.205 --> 10:39.838
No. And I'm not showing
my face at that school.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.374
Oh, Grace, come on.

10:42.576 --> 10:43.876
No, you come on.

10:44.041 --> 10:44.908
I'll get a ride to school.

10:45.458 --> 10:46.191
- Let's go!

10:52.640 --> 10:54.340
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

10:54.924 --> 10:56.757
- Where are you?
- Still here.

10:56.758 --> 10:59.961
- Grace was going to pick me up.
- "Was"?

11:00.530 --> 11:03.496
Would you stop worrying, please?
I'm fine. I'll be there.

11:03.497 --> 11:05.700
- I'll come back and get you.
- Don't be ridiculous.

11:05.701 --> 11:08.301
Well, then, I'll get Mike,
our driver, to drive you.

11:08.970 --> 11:09.870
I can drive me.

11:11.016 --> 11:13.616
Why was Grace gonna drive you
in the first place?

11:14.155 --> 11:15.290
I don't know.

11:15.291 --> 11:17.555
I think she had some plan
to ditch school.

11:17.556 --> 11:19.956
- She doesn't wanna see Grant.
- Why?

11:20.327 --> 11:22.327
Well, it's just
something stupid... sexing.

11:22.731 --> 11:25.331
Did you think about what
I asked you about last night?

11:26.136 --> 11:28.336
Ben, I'm not gonna
live with you, okay?

11:28.337 --> 11:30.325
I don't wanna live with you.
We're friends.

11:30.326 --> 11:31.636
Friends don't live together.

11:32.472 --> 11:34.872
Friends having babies
with friends live together.

11:36.144 --> 11:37.144
Or they could.

11:37.975 --> 11:38.642
I'll think about it.

11:40.169 --> 11:41.469
Have you seen Amy?

11:42.032 --> 11:42.732
No longer my concern.

11:44.604 --> 11:44.737
Hey.

11:44.738 --> 11:47.111
Hey, did you know Grace
is ditching school?

11:47.112 --> 11:48.405
What is wrong with her?

11:48.939 --> 11:51.074
She was supposed to pick up Adrian,
who's now gonna be late for school.

11:51.679 --> 11:53.347
Why would Grace ditch school?

11:53.348 --> 11:56.148
She didn't say anything to me
about ditching school.

11:55.644 --> 11:58.077
Of course, she's not
really talking to me.

11:58.685 --> 12:00.085
Um, something to do with sex?

12:00.086 --> 12:02.687
Oh, I'm out on that. I have
nothing more to say on that.

12:02.688 --> 12:04.754
Grace is no longer my concern.

12:06.739 --> 12:07.739
Where are you?

12:08.374 --> 12:10.141
I stopped by
to see you this morning.

12:10.309 --> 12:12.009
I thought maybe
I could be with you

12:12.345 --> 12:13.945
when you got
your test results back.

12:13.583 --> 12:15.583
I thought maybe
they would call this morning.

12:15.320 --> 12:17.487
You're at my apartment
with my mother?

12:18.688 --> 12:19.488
Test results? What test?

12:20.290 --> 12:21.124
Ricky had a test already?

12:21.125 --> 12:24.625
It's the second day of school.

12:26.000 --> 12:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:34.539 --> 12:37.139
That's not how I wanted you
to meet my mother.

12:37.177 --> 12:38.677
You were thinking
over high tea?

12:38.678 --> 12:40.215
I don't even know what that is.

12:40.216 --> 12:42.649
But don't mix "high"
and anything with my mother.

12:42.650 --> 12:44.517
What did she say to you?
Nothing.

12:44.518 --> 12:46.650
Nothing? You're almost
an hour late for school.

12:46.651 --> 12:49.955
Yeah, but I'm here now. Did you
hear anything from the clinic?

12:49.990 --> 12:51.956
No, I didn't hear anything yet.

12:51.459 --> 12:53.959
And I didn't need you
to add any stress to my day,

12:53.394 --> 12:55.694
while I'm waiting,
by talking to my mother.

12:55.797 --> 12:58.664
I'm sorry. I thought it was
a good thing I got to meet her.

12:59.331 --> 13:00.631
Well, it's not.

13:01.433 --> 13:02.333
She thinks I look like her.

13:03.370 --> 13:04.270
- What?
- Yeah.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.234
She has a picture in her wallet
of when she was my age.

13:06.277 --> 13:08.043
We do kind of look like
each other. Isn't that weird?

13:08.909 --> 13:10.809
Oh, God, no,
you do not look like my mother

13:10.810 --> 13:12.308
even if you look
like my mother,

13:12.342 --> 13:13.842
No, I do.
No, you don't.

13:14.878 --> 13:15.045
I do.

13:15.048 --> 13:16.681
Are you trying
to create some situation

13:16.685 --> 13:18.852
in which I never
wanna have sex with you?

13:18.853 --> 13:21.385
'Cause that's what you're
doing. What? No. No.

13:21.386 --> 13:24.054
I'm sure lots of guys marry girls
that look like their mothers.

13:25.890 --> 13:26.390
Not happy guys.

13:26.391 --> 13:27.991
She wants to meet John,
you know.

13:29.394 --> 13:29.994
Yeah, I know that.

13:30.032 --> 13:32.165
But we shouldn't just
let her meet John.

13:32.166 --> 13:34.328
Let's wait and see
if she stays sober

13:34.766 --> 13:36.399
before we go
introducing her to John

13:38.437 --> 13:38.937
or anyone else.

13:38.938 --> 13:42.306
You haven't been exposed to a
lot of this low-life stuff, Amy.

13:42.445 --> 13:47.345
And I hate to be the one to give you
an education in drugs and alcohol.

13:47.479 --> 13:49.579
But this is how addicts
and drunks are.

13:51.080 --> 13:51.647
They're likeable.

13:51.918 --> 13:53.585
A lot of them
are likeable anyway.

13:54.784 --> 13:55.618
They have to be likeable,

13:56.055 --> 13:58.022
otherwise they're
just addicts or drunks.

13:58.191 --> 14:00.091
And I'll tell you
something else.

14:00.260 --> 14:02.260
People who do that stuff
also lie.

14:03.463 --> 14:04.263
They're very good liars.

14:04.264 --> 14:06.328
First, they learn to lie
to cover up

14:07.495 --> 14:09.128
their alcohol
and drug problems.

14:09.470 --> 14:10.970
And then they lie to cover up

14:10.971 --> 14:13.569
all the problems their alcohol
and drug problems cause.

14:16.907 --> 14:18.207
She's pretty funny.

14:19.411 --> 14:20.911
No, she's not.

14:25.615 --> 14:25.982
No, she is.

14:26.023 --> 14:27.990
I have to get a note
to get into class.

14:27.991 --> 14:30.990
I do not want you hanging out
with my mother again. Understand?

14:32.094 --> 14:34.628
I understand, but it's not
really very nice.

14:35.895 --> 14:38.128
It's not fair to your mom
or to me.

14:38.428 --> 14:40.128
She wants to get to know me.

14:39.899 --> 14:41.632
I don't want her
to get to know you.

14:41.734 --> 14:43.903
Again, let's wait and see
if she stays sober.

14:43.904 --> 14:46.070
I'm just trying to be
responsible here, Amy.

14:47.107 --> 14:47.974
I'm trying to protect you.

14:48.444 --> 14:50.977
I think I can protect myself,
but thank you.

14:50.978 --> 14:54.041
Where were you this morning? I went
to see the guy who did our mediation

14:54.215 --> 14:55.648
to make sure that he knows that

14:54.916 --> 14:57.685
my mom won't be staying with me
for more than a few days,

14:57.686 --> 15:00.153
and that John won't be there
during that time.

15:00.154 --> 15:02.856
Where's she gonna stay? I
don't know. I'm working on it.

15:02.857 --> 15:05.789
Well, she's a grown woman. Why
don't you let her work on it?

15:05.790 --> 15:08.790
Because if I leave it up to her,
she'll just stick around.

15:08.791 --> 15:11.462
And she can't. Not without
interfering with me and John.

15:11.765 --> 15:13.598
I have to go.
We'll talk later.

15:13.194 --> 15:15.294
Oh, and text me
as soon as you hear.

15:16.937 --> 15:18.270
W- Wait.
You didn't tell my mother

15:18.271 --> 15:22.408
that the test I'm waiting on is
the test I'm waiting on, did you?

15:22.806 --> 15:25.506
We talked about so many things,
I don't remember.

15:29.216 --> 15:30.216
I have to go.

15:31.118 --> 15:31.885
Hi. Could I get a note?

15:31.050 --> 15:33.417
I'm running a little late
this morning.

15:33.720 --> 15:35.620
You do remember.
I'm sure you remember.

15:35.621 --> 15:37.154
Lying is contagious, you know.

15:37.990 --> 15:40.024
Did you also need a note?
No.

15:40.823 --> 15:41.623
Why aren't you in class?

15:41.626 --> 15:43.493
Because I'm me,
and I was waiting on her.

15:44.861 --> 15:45.561
And why are you late?

15:45.562 --> 15:48.730
I got delayed after I dropped
our son off at the nursery.

15:49.037 --> 15:50.804
I'm sorry,
but I'm just missing band.

15:50.136 --> 15:52.736
And it's marching season,
and I'm not marching

15:52.737 --> 15:55.372
and either is he, because we both
have other responsibilities now.

15:55.373 --> 15:58.140
But we'll both try to never
be late again. Promise.

15:59.074 --> 16:00.074
And you are?

16:00.276 --> 16:01.076
Ricky.

16:01.777 --> 16:03.077
Oh. You're Ricky.

16:03.679 --> 16:04.479
Yeah.

16:05.715 --> 16:06.282
Nice to meet you.

16:06.283 --> 16:08.519
And that must mean you're Amy? Mm-hmm.

16:08.624 --> 16:11.157
And I'm hoping that means
you know where Ashley is.

16:11.819 --> 16:12.686
She's doing homeschooling.

16:13.628 --> 16:15.094
Yeah, well,
I need the paperwork.

16:16.495 --> 16:17.095
I'll let her know.

16:17.096 --> 16:20.129
Is there something going on at
your house that I should know about?

16:20.130 --> 16:22.562
Do you mind? We're in
the middle of something.

16:27.905 --> 16:28.705
Oh.

16:31.244 --> 16:32.677
I'll take that as a yes.

16:32.678 --> 16:35.947
You haven't even spent time with my other
mother... my mother who took care of me.

16:35.584 --> 16:38.351
Other than at the mediation,
you haven't even seen her.

16:38.352 --> 16:40.917
I don't think she likes me. She
likes you, and I want you to like her.

16:40.822 --> 16:42.855
My other mother Nora...
I'm not so sure.

16:42.486 --> 16:44.752
I need to talk to you.
What's going on?

16:44.753 --> 16:48.090
What's going on cannot be more
important than having this conversation.

16:46.160 --> 16:49.727
Oh, yeah? Well, Lauren's
at home crying her eyes out

16:49.728 --> 16:51.695
because Jesse
just broke up with her.

16:53.133 --> 16:54.300
What? Why?
Oh, jeez, Amy.

16:54.334 --> 16:56.901
I have to talk to Madison.
Let me know, okay?

16:58.038 --> 16:59.338
She doesn't know.

16:59.504 --> 17:00.804
Doesn't know what?

17:00.904 --> 17:02.607
Ricky's birth mother
is visiting.

17:02.608 --> 17:04.407
She doesn't need
to know that either.

17:06.407 --> 17:06.708
"Either"?

17:06.613 --> 17:08.413
Lauren's taking it
pretty hard, huh?

17:08.414 --> 17:10.415
Yeah, and I feel
really bad for her.

17:10.685 --> 17:12.518
But in a way, Jesse's right.

17:12.519 --> 17:15.185
I mean, he and Jack are
going off to school next year.

17:15.185 --> 17:18.252
And what's the point of having a relationship
if you're gonna go off to college?

17:18.892 --> 17:20.959
Hold it, hold it.
You and Jack also broke up?

17:20.960 --> 17:22.589
You knew we were
gonna break up.

17:22.997 --> 17:24.597
No, I didn't.
And please tell me

17:23.896 --> 17:26.631
you did not break up with Jack
for that Stanley guy.

17:27.702 --> 17:29.936
No, I... I didn't.
I didn't do it for him.

17:31.471 --> 17:32.271
No, I... I did it for me.

17:33.638 --> 17:36.371
But I am bringing him home
to meet my dad tonight.

17:41.280 --> 17:42.113
Why aren't you at school?

17:43.548 --> 17:44.448
Did you and Grant break up?

17:46.217 --> 17:48.784
Was it something I said?
You think?

17:49.388 --> 17:51.288
Look, I don't think
you have anything.

17:54.257 --> 17:56.424
I don't think I ever
exposed you to anything.

17:58.462 --> 18:00.329
We were careful.
We were really careful.

18:01.701 --> 18:03.001
But things happen.

18:04.006 --> 18:06.639
Yeah, things that I didn't know
anything about.

18:08.404 --> 18:09.704
Why are you here?

18:10.006 --> 18:11.973
I don't really feel
like seeing Madison.

18:12.142 --> 18:14.142
Her dad wants me
to talk her into seeing me.

18:16.047 --> 18:17.347
But I don't know.

18:18.412 --> 18:19.278
I'm really upset with her.

18:20.653 --> 18:22.053
You know,
I was good this summer.

18:23.319 --> 18:24.253
I didn't do anything, and...

18:24.254 --> 18:27.326
Whew. I had plenty of
opportunities to do everything.

18:27.327 --> 18:30.961
Yeah, apparently you've always had
plenty of opportunities to do everything,

18:30.962 --> 18:33.628
and you always took full
advantage of those opportunities.

18:34.898 --> 18:35.898
Not always.

18:36.199 --> 18:38.699
And I don't really need
or want to do that anymore...

18:39.039 --> 18:40.705
take advantage
of every opportunity.

18:41.307 --> 18:43.340
So you had had sex
before we had sex?

18:43.341 --> 18:45.341
I thought you would've
assumed that.

18:47.547 --> 18:48.413
You kind of did it because

18:48.414 --> 18:50.548
you didn't want me having sex
with other girls,

18:52.319 --> 18:54.986
so I just thought you knew
I had sex with other girls.

18:56.289 --> 18:56.789
No, not really.

18:56.330 --> 18:59.163
I mean, I knew that you did
what you did with Adrian,

19:00.593 --> 19:01.093
but I didn't...

19:01.259 --> 19:03.693
You had sex, not oral sex...
sex with her?

19:05.666 --> 19:07.466
Look, I told you
to go get tested.

19:09.699 --> 19:10.699
What more do you want from me?

19:11.102 --> 19:12.802
This is as honest
as I care to get

19:14.405 --> 19:16.705
with an ex-girlfriend
who's seeing someone else.

19:17.773 --> 19:18.373
And you know what?

19:18.808 --> 19:20.875
I need my space.
I'm gonna ditch school today.

19:20.981 --> 19:22.747
You can't,
because if you get caught,

19:23.652 --> 19:25.885
you won't be able
to play this weekend.

19:26.252 --> 19:28.352
You need to go talk to Madison.

19:26.056 --> 19:30.756
'Cause if you don't, she's just
gonna do what you like doing with her

19:32.626 --> 19:33.392
but with somebody else.

19:34.961 --> 19:35.928
If you really care about her.

19:38.432 --> 19:39.398
Do you really care about her?

19:39.399 --> 19:43.702
Do you really actually care
about anyone other than yourself?

19:46.740 --> 19:47.773
I really care about you, Grace.

19:48.744 --> 19:51.179
I really wish I cared
about you, too, Jack.

19:51.180 --> 19:53.546
I really wish you cared
about me enough

19:53.547 --> 19:55.120
and I cared about you
enough that we could

19:55.121 --> 19:56.547
be together for the
rest of our lives,

19:56.851 --> 19:58.851
like how we felt
when we had sex.

20:00.186 --> 20:01.186
But I don't.

20:04.258 --> 20:05.224
I don't care about you, Jack.

20:16.597 --> 20:17.364
At least not like that.

20:29.621 --> 20:31.521
You still in your pajamas?

20:31.725 --> 20:34.025
Yeah, I stayed up late.
Twilight Zone-marathon.

20:31.622 --> 20:36.255
Off to a good start with
the homeschooling, I see.

20:39.095 --> 20:39.928
Well, this can't be good.

20:40.666 --> 20:41.666
Come in!

20:43.803 --> 20:46.136
Hi. I'm the new counselor,
Katelyn O'Malley.

20:47.871 --> 20:48.571
Are you Ashley's dad?

20:50.041 --> 20:51.341
Uh, yeah, I guess.

20:51.976 --> 20:52.676
Oh, may I come in in?

20:50.310 --> 20:55.380
I would've called first, but the number
I have on record isn't the right number.

20:55.381 --> 20:57.815
It isn't even
the right area code.

20:57.847 --> 20:59.647
Yeah, come on in.
I'm George.

21:01.219 --> 21:02.752
Nice to meet you.
Hi, Ashley.

21:03.124 --> 21:05.324
You can't just show up
at a student's house.

21:05.959 --> 21:08.459
There's no law against it.
Well, there should be.

21:09.993 --> 21:10.393
There's not.

21:10.495 --> 21:12.795
And there is a law
against not going to school.

21:13.997 --> 21:16.164
Unless you're 16
and officially dropping out.

21:16.298 --> 21:18.065
And I hope
you're not dropping out.

21:16.166 --> 21:20.066
No, no, no. She's not dropping
out. She's doing homeschooling.

21:20.871 --> 21:22.537
With what?
She doesn't have any books,

21:22.739 --> 21:24.572
and you don't have
a teacher's guide.

21:24.410 --> 21:26.243
You haven't set up
a schedule with me

21:25.780 --> 21:28.314
or with a teacher assigned
to cover homeschooling.

21:28.783 --> 21:30.879
Ashley, you still have to
come in once a week

21:30.880 --> 21:33.180
and go over your work
with a teacher.

21:31.716 --> 21:35.650
That's how we have homeschooling
set up in this district.

21:36.289 --> 21:37.456
What?
Yeah.

21:34.386 --> 21:39.486
It's just like school, only
you're doing the work on your own

21:40.892 --> 21:42.359
with a parent or another tutor.

21:41.896 --> 21:43.996
You still have to come in
once a week,

21:43.531 --> 21:46.264
and then a teacher will test you
on your progress.

21:46.639 --> 21:49.006
Or you can register
with another school...

21:46.403 --> 21:51.503
one that only does homeschooling...
and they can do the work with you

21:52.038 --> 21:54.871
on the computer, or by mail,
or in person like we do.

21:55.639 --> 21:57.872
But those schools
have a tuition, you know?

22:00.343 --> 22:02.010
No. We'll go
with what you have.

22:02.011 --> 22:04.812
Okay, well, then, I need the
form that I sent home signed.

22:05.547 --> 22:06.547
He signed it.

22:08.889 --> 22:10.823
You were supposed
to bring it back to me.

22:15.392 --> 22:15.725
Thank you.

22:15.161 --> 22:17.861
Your books are in the box
along with a planned schedule.

22:15.762 --> 22:20.329
And we'll see you at the
end of the week. Good luck.

22:20.799 --> 22:22.466
And nice to meet you, George.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.100
And I hope to not meet you
like this again.

22:27.306 --> 22:28.873
But I'm like that.
I show up.

22:30.949 --> 22:31.949
Bye, Ashley.

22:32.578 --> 22:34.811
And, oh, Ellen's doing
an all-dance show.

22:34.546 --> 22:36.513
It's probably
gonna be really good.

22:39.848 --> 22:42.081
You could do that
for your PE requirement.

22:46.494 --> 22:48.260
Still wanna do this?
Yeah.

22:48.261 --> 22:51.430
Why can't you just go to school? Is it
because your mother and I are divorced?

22:51.632 --> 22:53.667
Most kids' parents are divorced.
No one cares.

22:53.668 --> 22:55.901
Is it because Amy
and Ricky are dating?

22:55.001 --> 22:57.734
You don't wanna be around
Amy and Ricky at school?

22:57.735 --> 22:59.734
You know, I can't believe
I ever liked him.

22:59.735 --> 23:01.273
I don't like him.
He's annoying.

23:00.803 --> 23:03.136
Is it that you don't
have a boyfriend?

23:04.105 --> 23:04.205
No.

23:03.976 --> 23:05.743
Is it that
you don't have a friend?

23:04.974 --> 23:07.274
You have a friend.
Griffin's your friend.

23:08.708 --> 23:09.508
He...

23:10.616 --> 23:12.249
Not really.
But I don't need a friend.

23:14.213 --> 23:14.946
I don't need a friend.

23:15.785 --> 23:17.052
Come on.
Ashley in home-school?

23:17.024 --> 23:18.791
She can't seriously
be doing that.

23:19.455 --> 23:20.355
She's seriously doing that.

23:21.490 --> 23:22.123
Why? Because of me?

23:22.124 --> 23:24.896
Not because of me. Probably because
of you. You were her best friend.

23:24.897 --> 23:28.231
Well, I'm still her best
friend. You sure about that?

23:25.836 --> 23:30.469
You sure you're not just hanging
out with Peter and ignoring Ashley?

23:30.703 --> 23:32.770
I make time for Ashley.
I doubt it.

23:32.104 --> 23:34.838
So why don't you talk to her
instead of talking to me?

23:35.708 --> 23:36.508
I'd like to talk to you.

23:37.640 --> 23:38.440
Enjoy.

23:38.747 --> 23:39.514
Grace is at home today.

23:40.111 --> 23:41.011
Is she?
Yeah.

23:41.179 --> 23:43.079
And? And I thought you ought know.

23:43.080 --> 23:45.082
I hadn't seen her
around school this morning,

23:45.680 --> 23:47.580
so I kind of figured that out.

23:48.052 --> 23:49.652
Madison.
I don't wanna talk, Jack!

23:49.852 --> 23:52.318
Madison, what happened?
I wanna know what happened.

23:52.893 --> 23:54.326
I wanna know how this happened.

23:55.161 --> 23:55.661
I met somebody.

23:55.662 --> 23:57.760
I met someone who wasn't
interested in sex.

23:57.761 --> 24:00.128
I met someone who...
who liked me for me.

24:00.331 --> 24:02.331
He's 20 years old,
and he's not interested

24:02.433 --> 24:04.600
in any kind of sexual
relationship with you?

24:04.707 --> 24:08.674
Come on. He's lying. He's
just saying that to seduce you.

24:12.245 --> 24:13.145
How did you know he was 20?

24:14.013 --> 24:16.013
Who told you he was 20?
Lauren.

24:16.117 --> 24:18.684
Uh, Lauren's not here,
and I saw her this morning.

24:20.288 --> 24:22.788
If you talked to her,
she would've told me.

24:24.857 --> 24:26.392
Madison...

24:26.393 --> 24:28.293
You can stay in the guest room.

24:28.294 --> 24:30.796
We'll make the guest room into
a nursery and a room for you.

24:30.365 --> 24:33.131
We were gonna do that anyway.
It's time to do that.

24:32.398 --> 24:34.499
And you can start
staying there now

24:34.500 --> 24:36.400
so that when
the baby gets here,

24:36.430 --> 24:38.597
you and the baby
can stay at our house.

24:39.703 --> 24:40.836
Okay, Ben.
Listen to me.

24:42.606 --> 24:43.339
You and I are friends.

24:45.210 --> 24:46.010
We're very good friends.

24:46.213 --> 24:48.313
Friends who are
having a daughter.

24:48.314 --> 24:50.315
I'm really happy
the baby's a girl.

24:50.316 --> 24:52.918
Really happy. I was afraid
that if she was a boy,

24:52.919 --> 24:55.621
there'd be some competition
between John and our son.

24:55.622 --> 24:58.554
But there's not gonna be any of
that now because she's a girl.

24:59.289 --> 25:01.455
I'm sure the four of us
will still somehow

25:01.624 --> 25:03.758
have our children
competing against each other.

25:05.760 --> 25:06.326
But, anyway, Ben,

25:06.898 --> 25:08.498
we're not ready
to live together.

25:09.036 --> 25:11.136
We're not ready
to have a baby either,

25:11.137 --> 25:14.032
but we're having a baby, and I
wanna be with you and the baby.

25:15.873 --> 25:17.140
I know.
And I really appreciate

25:17.608 --> 25:20.075
that you've so stepped up
to the plate here, Ben,

25:21.877 --> 25:24.011
and you've just been
so responsible and kind

25:25.011 --> 25:26.711
and considerate
and everything else,

25:28.214 --> 25:28.414
but...

25:28.717 --> 25:30.351
Look, I'm not
living with you, okay?

25:30.352 --> 25:33.725
I'm definitely not living
with you unless we're married.

25:33.825 --> 25:36.258
Are... Are you saying
you wanna get married?

25:36.558 --> 25:38.591
No, I'm not saying
I wanna get married.

25:40.399 --> 25:43.932
I'm saying I'm not living
with you unless we're married.

25:45.102 --> 25:46.402
No. No, no, no.

25:46.837 --> 25:47.704
Do not get any ideas, Ben.

25:48.938 --> 25:49.438
What?
Ben,

25:50.638 --> 25:51.338
do not get any ideas.

25:53.843 --> 25:55.876
I did not mean
I want to get married right now.

26:01.550 --> 26:02.550
Yeah.

26:02.660 --> 26:03.960
Yeah, I can hold.

26:19.371 --> 26:21.484
Hey, have you seen Nora?

26:20.504 --> 26:22.838
Bunny said she thought
she was in the apartment.

26:23.008 --> 26:24.542
She's not.
Nora who?

26:25.513 --> 26:26.046
Nora, my mother.

26:25.114 --> 26:27.547
We're not gonna call her "Mom,"
all right?

26:26.915 --> 26:29.349
She's "Nora" when she's here,
if she's here.

26:30.152 --> 26:31.085
I don't know where she went.

26:31.952 --> 26:34.152
She's in the freezer,
cooling off.

26:34.286 --> 26:36.052
You called her parole officer?

26:36.053 --> 26:39.656
No. And if I had someone call
him, it's none of your business.

26:41.926 --> 26:43.226
Well, hello, Ricky.

26:44.662 --> 26:45.462
Hello.

26:46.365 --> 26:48.365
Evidently I have to
find a place to live.

26:48.068 --> 26:49.701
You knew
you couldn't live here.

26:50.971 --> 26:51.604
Well, no, I didn't.

26:51.605 --> 26:53.837
I told them your place
could be my place.

26:53.939 --> 26:55.705
I told you
you couldn't live here.

26:57.744 --> 26:57.844
No.

26:57.544 --> 26:59.778
I did. I told you
I didn't want anything

26:57.510 --> 27:01.543
to threaten my custody
agreement with Amy.

27:01.812 --> 27:03.479
Which is why
I made friends with Amy.

27:03.817 --> 27:05.484
She likes me.
She'd have no problem

27:05.086 --> 27:07.253
with little John staying
with you and me.

27:08.320 --> 27:09.620
Did she say that?

27:09.924 --> 27:11.224
No, but I can tell.

27:11.359 --> 27:12.225
Amy doesn't even know you.

27:11.627 --> 27:14.527
And Amy really shouldn't be
the one to make that decision.

27:14.062 --> 27:16.362
I should be the one
to make that decision.

27:17.865 --> 27:20.199
Oh, because you know me?
Yeah.

27:21.466 --> 27:22.766
You don't know me.

27:23.236 --> 27:23.403
Okay.

27:23.404 --> 27:25.505
Well, I would like
to get to know you

27:26.972 --> 27:29.606
before I make a decision
that could affect my son.

27:30.175 --> 27:31.742
By the way, she looks like me.

27:31.743 --> 27:34.843
So if you think I have
problems, I've got news for you.

27:34.844 --> 27:37.415
You're the one who has problems,
because Amy looks just like me.

27:37.983 --> 27:38.983
Just like me.

27:39.454 --> 27:39.754
But, Mom,

27:39.755 --> 27:42.085
unlike you, she does not
drink or do drugs.

27:44.254 --> 27:45.954
I don't drink
or do drugs, okay?

27:47.029 --> 27:48.929
Fair enough.
But you did drink and do drugs.

27:50.198 --> 27:50.998
And I know you're sober,

27:50.496 --> 27:52.996
and I know you're turning
your life around.

27:54.103 --> 27:56.403
But until I'm sure
you've turned your life around,

27:58.339 --> 28:00.605
I don't want you living
at my house.

28:04.647 --> 28:06.947
I didn't know Ricky's mom
got sprung.

28:07.647 --> 28:10.214
Yep. And she's gonna work here,
which is good.

28:11.316 --> 28:13.382
When the baby comes,
I'll have extra help,

28:14.790 --> 28:16.423
and you can take
paternity leave.

28:17.691 --> 28:20.091
Yeah. We're having a girl.
Did you hear?

28:21.426 --> 28:22.026
No, I didn't hear.

28:22.363 --> 28:23.996
That's wonderful.
Baby girl.

28:27.301 --> 28:28.601
Yeah. Baby girl.

28:30.004 --> 28:30.771
You look kind of happy.

28:31.673 --> 28:32.973
I am kind of happy.

28:34.069 --> 28:35.369
I don't know why.

28:36.645 --> 28:38.212
I'm 17,
and I got a girl pregnant,

28:39.048 --> 28:41.282
and we're having a baby,
and yet...

28:43.116 --> 28:43.949
Yeah, I am kind of happy.

28:43.985 --> 28:45.985
Maybe even more
than kind of happy.

28:46.819 --> 28:48.119
What are you up to?

28:48.957 --> 28:49.957
I don't know.

28:50.758 --> 28:53.192
I don't know anything anymore.

28:53.193 --> 28:56.829
My life is a mess, and it's
getting messier all the time,

28:57.066 --> 28:58.832
and yet I am kind of happy.

29:08.242 --> 29:10.876
Good to see you, old friend,
old buddy of mine.

29:11.977 --> 29:13.277
I have to study.

29:14.514 --> 29:16.547
No, you don't.
You have time to talk.

29:16.618 --> 29:18.218
All right.
I've been nice.

29:18.752 --> 29:19.718
Now I'm not going to be nice.

29:19.855 --> 29:22.624
I want you back in school,
and you're going back to school

29:22.625 --> 29:24.925
unless, and until,
you tell me the truth

29:24.927 --> 29:27.294
about why you're not
going back to school.

29:27.295 --> 29:29.562
I don't make any decisions
out of fear.

29:30.499 --> 29:32.399
That's good.
But in this case,

29:33.567 --> 29:34.567
be afraid.

29:36.101 --> 29:37.401
Be very afraid.

29:37.805 --> 29:38.605
Tell Peter I said hello.

29:40.168 --> 29:41.468
Yeah, I will. Bye.

29:53.721 --> 29:54.521
Bye.

29:56.090 --> 29:56.657
Hey. How'd it go?

29:56.658 --> 29:59.259
Ah, couldn't get it out of her.
She wants to be home-schooled.

29:56.558 --> 29:59.861
Ah, she's just busting my chops, seeing
if I'll go along with her on this.

29:59.862 --> 30:02.731
So I'm gonna go along with her on
this until she changes her mind.

30:02.732 --> 30:07.169
You know, you could, uh, get her
into a group of home-schooled students.

30:07.170 --> 30:09.736
You just tell the school
you want her to get involved

30:09.002 --> 30:11.636
with some of the other students
to make friends,

30:11.737 --> 30:13.837
and they'll set her up
with a study buddy

30:14.037 --> 30:16.037
and other kids to go
on field trips with

30:16.039 --> 30:17.572
and all kinds
of stuff like that.

30:17.573 --> 30:20.612
Ashley? Ashley with a study
buddy, going on field trips?

30:21.981 --> 30:22.748
That's what my mom did.

30:23.851 --> 30:24.684
That's all I'm gonna say.

30:26.585 --> 30:29.685
That, and I was back in school
24 hours after meeting my buddy.

30:33.859 --> 30:35.726
I love that guy.

30:48.709 --> 30:49.409
Don't you even knock?

30:52.311 --> 30:53.277
I missed you at school today.

30:54.347 --> 30:56.614
I missed seeing you.
I missed talking to you.

30:57.984 --> 30:58.651
I wanna talk to you.

31:00.249 --> 31:01.549
I don't know why.

31:02.222 --> 31:03.988
I'm, like,
some disease-carrying skank.

31:03.989 --> 31:05.992
I don't know why
you wanna talk to me.

31:07.426 --> 31:08.426
"Disease-carrying skank," huh?

31:08.227 --> 31:10.761
Will you be using terms
like that with your patients?

31:10.762 --> 31:13.965
What patients? Why do you
think I'm gonna be a doctor?

31:14.431 --> 31:16.698
I just spent six weeks
with you at med camp.

31:16.938 --> 31:18.438
It's a camp
with excelled classes

31:17.605 --> 31:20.505
for qualified students who have
an interest in medicine.

31:20.975 --> 31:23.142
Well, I don't have
an interest anymore.

31:26.376 --> 31:27.176
I feel stupid and dirty.

31:29.513 --> 31:30.313
Wow.

31:31.483 --> 31:32.783
You can go now.

31:36.888 --> 31:37.654
I'm not going anywhere.

31:39.493 --> 31:41.793
Am I supposed to say
I don't care what Jack said?

31:41.729 --> 31:43.729
We should just ignore
what he said?

31:43.164 --> 31:45.165
Because I can't ignore
what he said,

31:45.166 --> 31:47.532
and obviously you can't
ignore what he said.

31:48.700 --> 31:49.534
He was just being honest.

31:49.268 --> 31:51.268
He's been exposed
to some infections,

31:50.872 --> 31:53.372
so best to see if you
were exposed to some infections,

31:53.373 --> 31:57.175
and then if you were, you take
care of that and then move on.

31:57.777 --> 31:59.677
But it's not likely
that you were.

32:00.212 --> 32:00.878
But I might've been.

32:02.649 --> 32:03.949
Yeah. That happens.

32:05.387 --> 32:07.454
But even if it did happen,
best to know.

32:07.455 --> 32:09.722
It wouldn't change anything
between us.

32:11.160 --> 32:13.860
Just knowing I had a reason
to get tested for an STI

32:14.628 --> 32:15.628
changes everything between us,

32:15.095 --> 32:17.861
'cause it changes how I feel
about myself, all right?

32:18.031 --> 32:20.198
No, not all right.
You can't let Jack's lies

32:19.732 --> 32:22.032
and adventures wreck
your self-esteem, Grace.

32:23.935 --> 32:24.202
Come on.

32:23.871 --> 32:26.438
Yeah, this is that part
in the lecture from your mom

32:26.571 --> 32:28.638
where she mentioned
emotional damage.

32:30.010 --> 32:32.177
Sex in high school
leading to emotional damage.

32:33.479 --> 32:35.548
Come on. This STI thing's
the downside,

32:35.549 --> 32:37.684
but there's definitely
an upside to having sex.

32:37.685 --> 32:39.852
I'm never gonna take
that chance again.

32:40.087 --> 32:42.854
So if that's all you want,
just stay away from me, okay?

32:43.924 --> 32:44.524
Stay away from me.

32:44.525 --> 32:47.923
Why don't we just give ourselves a
little more time and see what happens?

32:53.660 --> 32:54.460
No.

32:54.933 --> 32:56.399
Come on,
you disease-carrying skank.

33:05.075 --> 33:05.742
You know I love you.

33:07.613 --> 33:09.313
You really have
a way with words.

33:11.682 --> 33:12.982
What did you say?

33:15.187 --> 33:16.187
I love you.

33:18.188 --> 33:19.088
You know I love you, Grace.

33:27.867 --> 33:29.167
Say it, please.

33:34.204 --> 33:35.504
I love you, too.

33:36.910 --> 33:39.110
I don't wanna get tested
for anything.

33:40.679 --> 33:42.779
Don't make such
a big deal out of this.

33:43.819 --> 33:45.752
I'm not gonna make
a big deal out of it.

33:46.988 --> 33:49.888
You just do what you have to do.
That's how life works.

33:50.873 --> 33:51.873
You love me?

33:57.843 --> 33:58.843
I love you.

33:58.912 --> 34:01.712
And I'm not just saying that
so you'll have sex with me.

34:03.801 --> 34:05.696
I'm saying that so if
you don't have sex

34:05.697 --> 34:07.499
with me, you'll still
know how I feel.

34:13.458 --> 34:14.458
Hi, Lauren.

34:15.260 --> 34:16.260
Oh. Hey, Amy.

34:16.793 --> 34:17.594
What are you doing here?

34:18.063 --> 34:19.830
I dropped John off with my dad.

34:19.831 --> 34:21.965
Just thought I'd come by
and say hi.

34:28.474 --> 34:30.306
I'm really sorry
about you and Jesse.

34:31.840 --> 34:32.840
I'm okay.

34:33.143 --> 34:34.444
No, you're not.

34:35.206 --> 34:36.206
I'm not.

34:37.047 --> 34:38.581
It's sad.
I know you really like him.

34:39.414 --> 34:41.780
Yeah, well, I guess
it's better to break up now

34:41.781 --> 34:44.989
then after another year together,
'cause it would really kill me.

34:47.623 --> 34:48.556
You must be in so much pain.

34:48.694 --> 34:50.694
So, you probably
don't wanna hear this,

34:52.431 --> 34:53.165
but I'm sure there are

34:53.166 --> 34:55.833
a lot of other guys that would
love to go out with you.

34:57.668 --> 34:58.502
I don't want another guy.

34:59.205 --> 35:01.305
I don't wanna go out
with other guys.

35:01.306 --> 35:05.110
I'm stopping right here, 'cause I
never wanna feel like this again.

35:05.612 --> 35:08.346
I'm really happy I didn't
have sex with that idiot.

35:08.683 --> 35:11.449
I mean, could you imagine
how I'd be feeling right now

35:11.550 --> 35:13.683
if I had has sex
with that idiot?

35:15.685 --> 35:17.585
Yeah. It could be worse,
I guess.

35:18.521 --> 35:20.354
But maybe he really
cares about you.

35:20.558 --> 35:22.591
Maybe that's why
he didn't have sex with you.

35:22.958 --> 35:25.091
Maybe he was thinking
that in the long run,

35:25.329 --> 35:27.063
it wouldn't be
the best thing for you.

35:27.698 --> 35:28.498
And th

35:29.833 --> 35:32.133
And the best thing
was to break up with me?

35:33.239 --> 35:34.606
I don't know.

35:35.941 --> 35:38.641
All I know is you're my friend
and you stuck by me,

35:38.642 --> 35:42.078
so if there's anything I can
do for you, I'm here for you.

35:43.415 --> 35:44.415
Thanks, Amy.

35:46.552 --> 35:47.318
I really appreciate it.

35:48.763 --> 35:51.263
You know, if you and I
are Madison's friends,

35:51.324 --> 35:53.690
we would go over there
and tell her dad

35:53.755 --> 35:55.722
that she's lying
about this guy.

35:58.329 --> 35:59.129
Is she?

35:59.295 --> 36:01.929
It doesn't always work out.
I mean, look at you two.

36:02.731 --> 36:04.531
Clearly, Emily's
not Madison's mother.

36:08.137 --> 36:10.037
This has to be
your second marriage, right?

36:10.775 --> 36:12.542
Um, actually,
I forgot to tell you.

36:13.647 --> 36:15.047
My mom died.
Oh, bummer.

36:15.048 --> 36:18.211
Well, that's another reason things
don't work out sometimes, huh?

36:20.215 --> 36:21.015
Death.

36:21.051 --> 36:22.817
That's why I say
live for today.

36:27.127 --> 36:28.660
While you can.
Right, Morg?

36:29.994 --> 36:32.961
Madison, why don't you and I
get the boys a piece of cake?

36:33.665 --> 36:34.665
We have cake?

36:35.664 --> 36:36.964
We'll bake a cake.

36:37.269 --> 36:38.269
You bake?

36:44.575 --> 36:45.275
I'll learn. Let's go.

36:46.677 --> 36:48.444
How old are you?

36:48.780 --> 36:50.513
How old did Madison say I was?

36:50.148 --> 36:51.650
Do you have a driver's license?

36:51.651 --> 36:54.218
I'm old enough to drive.
I've been driving for years.

36:55.622 --> 36:57.288
How many years?
I beg your pardon?

36:58.155 --> 36:58.955
You're not 20 years old.

36:58.956 --> 37:00.459
20 years old would be too old.

37:00.460 --> 37:02.831
But you're years older
than 20 years old.

37:05.195 --> 37:06.761
20 and a half.

37:06.762 --> 37:08.866
A little joke. You have
a sense of humor, right?

37:08.867 --> 37:10.934
Not when it comes to my
daughter. No, I don't.

37:10.935 --> 37:15.268
Hey, you're the one who made
her go to work this summer.

37:15.639 --> 37:17.239
All right?
All I did was hire her.

37:17.376 --> 37:19.243
And maybe flirt
with her a little.

37:19.313 --> 37:21.413
But I'm not a pushy guy,
all right?

37:22.646 --> 37:23.713
Madison wants to go out with me.

37:24.217 --> 37:26.050
I don't care
what Madison wants.

37:26.384 --> 37:28.350
You're not going out with her.

37:29.220 --> 37:30.220
Get out.

37:30.389 --> 37:31.389
But I haven't had my cake yet.

37:33.889 --> 37:35.689
- There is no cake.
- What, cookies?

37:38.325 --> 37:38.758
Bye, Madison.

37:38.759 --> 37:40.397
- What happened?
- What happened?

37:40.398 --> 37:42.034
What happened
is that creepy guy,

37:42.035 --> 37:44.603
who must be 30-something,
was trying to go out with you.

37:44.604 --> 37:47.170
- He's not 30-something.
- Well, he's not 20.

37:47.571 --> 37:49.937
Well, I thought he was,
you know, around 20.

37:51.710 --> 37:53.244
He's not.
And he's...simple

37:54.645 --> 37:55.279
and, again, creepy.

37:55.280 --> 37:57.280
Why would you wanna
go out with him?

37:57.950 --> 38:00.115
Because he likes me.
He really likes me.

38:00.116 --> 38:02.716
He says nice things to me.
Like what?

38:04.090 --> 38:05.890
I don't know.
Like, that I smell nice

38:06.699 --> 38:09.366
and that my hair is pretty
and I have a great body.

38:10.324 --> 38:11.124
What?

38:11.126 --> 38:11.493
What? I do.

38:11.995 --> 38:13.562
My God, are you that naive?

38:14.866 --> 38:15.333
Oh, excuse me.

38:12.698 --> 38:15.463
You're the one who
made me work at that

38:15.464 --> 38:18.298
stupid food court this
summer, you know?

38:18.900 --> 38:20.500
And Stanley is the only mature,

38:21.306 --> 38:23.406
polite, decent,
responsible guy there, you know?

38:23.407 --> 38:25.409
And everybody knows
that the food court

38:25.410 --> 38:28.077
is just like a steaming bowl
of Styrofoam and sex.

38:25.247 --> 38:30.481
Everybody knows that. The
food court is where people

38:30.650 --> 38:33.216
have breakfast, lunch,
and dinner while shopping.

38:33.706 --> 38:35.106
Yeah. Who's naive now, huh?

38:44.872 --> 38:45.672
Well, I'm very relieved.

38:46.537 --> 38:47.904
Yes. We both are.
Yeah.

38:47.905 --> 38:50.744
It's good news. I mean, I
wasn't really worried, but...

38:51.647 --> 38:54.513
But you don't wanna get yourself
in that situation again

38:54.514 --> 38:57.080
where you'll need to take
one of those tests.

38:57.081 --> 38:59.716
Let's just let him enjoy one
evening without a lecture.

38:59.919 --> 39:02.319
No, no. I don't mind.
I don't mind lectures at all.

39:02.122 --> 39:04.055
You're both very good
at lecturing.

39:04.325 --> 39:06.825
That's probably the reason
I am where I am today.

39:07.194 --> 39:09.592
I mean, I'm not perfect.
I'm far from perfect.

39:09.593 --> 39:11.933
But without the two of you
and your lectures,

39:11.934 --> 39:15.101
who knows where
my life would be.

39:17.064 --> 39:18.364
What's going on?

39:18.404 --> 39:19.870
No, no.
You're not getting married.

39:19.871 --> 39:21.905
You're still too young
to get married.

39:22.808 --> 39:23.208
I know that.

39:23.211 --> 39:25.744
And I hope you wouldn't
have sex with Amy either.

39:26.957 --> 39:27.657
Just give it a while.

39:27.658 --> 39:29.780
See if you stay interested
in being with her.

39:30.552 --> 39:32.685
It's not about Amy.
This isn't about Amy.

39:33.322 --> 39:36.122
Well, do you wanna keep us
guessing what it is about,

39:36.390 --> 39:38.426
or you wanna just tell us?
Just tell us.

39:38.427 --> 39:41.060
I did a quadruple bypass
at the hospital this morning.

39:41.061 --> 39:43.100
I gotta get back to the patient
after dinner.

39:43.759 --> 39:44.426
I don't wanna guess.

39:50.138 --> 39:52.071
I managed to get Nora
out of jail.

39:53.940 --> 39:56.073
And you're calling her
Nora now.

39:56.776 --> 39:58.743
I'm calling her Nora.
You know why?

39:59.477 --> 40:01.477
'Cause you're my mother.
She's Nora.

40:03.014 --> 40:04.681
You raised me.
You cared for me.

40:06.717 --> 40:08.517
You're my mother,
and she's Nora.

40:09.421 --> 40:11.454
Is there a reason
you're sucking up to her?

40:13.192 --> 40:14.726
Not just her.
Both of you.

40:15.160 --> 40:17.427
I need to find someplace
for Nora to live.

40:18.662 --> 40:19.462
And?

40:19.999 --> 40:20.799
Uh-oh.

40:21.133 --> 40:23.966
What do you mean, "Uh-oh"?
I do know apartment managers.

40:24.567 --> 40:26.067
I can...
I can check around.

40:26.068 --> 40:29.638
You don't think it would be possible
for her to live here, do you?

40:31.744 --> 40:32.544
No. No.

40:33.278 --> 40:33.444
Here?

40:33.445 --> 40:36.713
I think she needs parents.
I'm not ready to be her parent.

40:42.155 --> 40:44.355
I'm still recovering
from her being my parent.

40:44.859 --> 40:46.759
It's just so
she'd live with you?

40:47.924 --> 40:48.457
I mean, with us?

40:48.895 --> 40:50.995
No. This is because
this is what I wanna do.

40:50.996 --> 40:52.533
This is what
you wanna do today.

40:52.534 --> 40:54.501
It may not be
what you wanna do tomorrow

40:54.502 --> 40:57.301
or the next day or the next year
or the rest of your life.

40:57.370 --> 40:59.770
Yeah, but no one really
ever knows that, do they?

40:59.771 --> 41:02.639
They know that. You don't
sound as if you know that.

41:02.640 --> 41:04.387
And you have a history
of making some big

41:04.388 --> 41:06.176
decisions without
thinking things through.

41:07.414 --> 41:08.714
Come on. Like what?

41:10.651 --> 41:11.551
Uh, like, uh, marrying Amy,

41:11.552 --> 41:13.619
having sex with Adrian
to get back at Amy.

41:13.754 --> 41:16.254
Okay. That's not a history,
that's two things.

41:16.255 --> 41:18.758
And as it turns out, one of
those things is a good thing.

41:18.891 --> 41:22.057
I'm happy I had sex with Adrian,
I'm happy we're having a baby,

41:22.058 --> 41:24.597
and I'm happy I'm getting
married, for real this time.

41:24.933 --> 41:27.133
Ben, take a deep breath
here, son.

41:28.202 --> 41:28.968
Slow down a little bit.

41:28.969 --> 41:32.936
I know you're all excited about
the idea of getting married,

41:32.941 --> 41:35.441
but let's think about
the reality of getting married...

41:35.442 --> 41:37.176
of you and Adrian
getting married

41:38.311 --> 41:39.244
when you're 17 and she's 18.

41:39.245 --> 41:41.097
And neither of you would
be thinking about

41:41.098 --> 41:43.078
getting married if you
weren't having a baby.

41:43.516 --> 41:44.850
We might.
Ben.

41:47.585 --> 41:48.451
Dad, we are having a baby,

41:48.452 --> 41:51.691
and I wanna be married to the baby's
mother before the baby gets here.

41:52.757 --> 41:53.457
Okay. How about this?

41:53.227 --> 41:55.727
How about if you wait
until the baby's a year old?

41:55.728 --> 41:59.162
If the baby's a year old and you
still wanna do this, then do it.

41:59.163 --> 42:01.430
Just don't do it now.
It's too soon.

42:02.867 --> 42:03.101
A year?

42:03.102 --> 42:05.237
My daughter is supposed
to walk around a year

42:04.571 --> 42:07.205
without knowing her mother
and father are married?

42:07.741 --> 42:09.641
They don't walk the first year.

42:10.178 --> 42:12.277
And she won't know
for a few years.

42:12.278 --> 42:15.178
You have a few years to decide,
if that's your concern.

42:16.180 --> 42:17.180
A few years?

42:17.249 --> 42:19.815
We started at one year,
and now we're at a few years.

42:19.985 --> 42:22.018
Dad, we're moving
in the wrong direction.

42:22.019 --> 42:24.150
All right. A year.
A year after the baby's born.

42:25.058 --> 42:26.458
No. Now.
I wanna get married now.

42:25.958 --> 42:28.058
Does Adrian wanna
get married now?

42:29.062 --> 42:29.662
I'm sure she does.

42:29.797 --> 42:31.997
Have you asked her?
No. I'm asking you first.

42:32.033 --> 42:34.798
You know, if you have to ask
your dad's permission first,

42:34.799 --> 42:36.934
maybe you're just
a little too young.

42:36.935 --> 42:39.168
The groom usually
just asks the bride's father.

42:39.472 --> 42:41.539
I'll get to that.
And, you know, next year,

42:41.540 --> 42:43.673
I'm 18, and I won't need
your permission.

42:43.942 --> 42:45.976
No, you won't.
So wait till next year.

42:46.477 --> 42:48.444
No, I'm not waiting
until next year.

42:49.612 --> 42:51.079
Dad, please.
Please, Dad.

42:51.581 --> 42:53.082
This is my life.
It's my life.

42:53.083 --> 42:55.150
I wanna share it
with Adrian and our daughter.

42:56.489 --> 42:58.255
You know it's
the right thing to do.

42:58.061 --> 43:00.361
Her father knows it's
the right thing to do.

42:59.929 --> 43:03.796
I know it's the right thing
to do. Just let me get married.
