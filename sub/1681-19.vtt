WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:05.134
You will not believe what happened
at laser tag last night.

00:05.559 --> 00:06.809
People freaked out because

00:06.978 --> 00:09.441
a creepy man in a suit
wouldn't leave their kids alone?

00:11.271 --> 00:12.740
Well, yeah, pretty much.

00:17.712 --> 00:19.364
Come on!
You want it?!

00:21.775 --> 00:22.876
My shoulder!

00:23.838 --> 00:24.839
Come on.

00:25.904 --> 00:28.443
Stinson, my office! Now!

00:28.712 --> 00:29.529
Crap.

00:30.867 --> 00:32.502
Disorderly game play,

00:32.627 --> 00:34.833
three counts of shoving,
and now this!

00:35.192 --> 00:37.122
Stinson, you're a liability!

00:37.549 --> 00:40.697
I know, I don't play
by your precious rules, McCracken,

00:40.822 --> 00:43.060
but, damn it, I get results!

00:43.228 --> 00:46.137
Look, you're a good
laser tag player.

00:46.479 --> 00:48.410
Maybe the best I've ever seen.

00:48.535 --> 00:51.220
But one of these days,
you're gonna get someone hurt.

00:51.345 --> 00:52.582
Maybe even yourself.

00:53.426 --> 00:55.373
You just forgot
what it's like out there.

00:55.498 --> 00:58.220
You've had your fat ass stuck
behind that desk for too long.

00:58.540 --> 01:00.366
That's it!
You're out of here, Stinson!

01:00.491 --> 01:02.163
Hand in your gun and your ID badge!

01:02.288 --> 01:03.490
With pleasure.

01:07.641 --> 01:10.457
Please don't do this.
This game is all I got.

01:11.366 --> 01:14.299
And I've almost got enough tickets
for the remote control helicopter.

01:15.595 --> 01:16.596
Please.

01:18.978 --> 01:21.081
I can't believe I'm doing this.

01:22.050 --> 01:24.453
But I'm gonna give
you one last shot.

01:25.117 --> 01:26.327
But so help me,

01:26.608 --> 01:29.052
if you so much as step one toe
out of line,

01:29.178 --> 01:31.494
you'll play Duck Hunt
in your mama's basement so fast,

01:31.619 --> 01:33.363
it's gonna make your head spin.

01:34.054 --> 01:35.606
Now, get out of here!

01:38.982 --> 01:40.585
You won't regret this.

01:47.682 --> 01:50.966
That's it, Stinson.
You're banned for life!

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:59.863 --> 02:02.265
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow

02:12.726 --> 02:15.899
I can't believe you got kicked out
of laser tag. What are you gonna do?

02:16.067 --> 02:18.803
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

02:18.928 --> 02:20.953
I'll tell you
what Ted and I are gonna do.

02:21.569 --> 02:25.519
We're gonna break in after hours
and TP the place.

02:26.769 --> 02:30.196
Barney, we are too old
to cover a place in toilet paper

02:30.321 --> 02:32.279
because they won't
let you play laser tag.

02:32.404 --> 02:34.483
And for that matter,
too old for laser tag.

02:34.864 --> 02:37.675
Ted, laser tag knows
no age restrictions.

02:37.954 --> 02:39.745
Kind of like stripping
in the Midwest.

02:40.228 --> 02:41.457
Yeah, whatever.

02:41.582 --> 02:43.546
I'm adding laser tag
to the Murtaugh List.

02:43.715 --> 02:46.980
- Jeez, not the Murtaugh List.
- What's the Murtaugh List?

02:47.105 --> 02:49.240
<i>The Murtaugh List is something
that came into being</i>

02:49.365 --> 02:50.926
<i>around the time I turned 30.</i>

02:51.051 --> 02:53.360
<i>It all started with
yourUncle Marshall's beer bong.</i>

02:54.004 --> 02:55.564
... two, one, chug!

02:55.689 --> 02:57.185
<i>When we were in our early 20s,</i>

02:57.310 --> 02:59.874
<i>every time we had a party,
that beer bong came out.</i>

02:59.999 --> 03:02.702
<i>And around the time
we turned 30, same thing.</i>

03:03.122 --> 03:05.890
<i>Of course, in our early 20s,
the next day would go like this.</i>

03:07.151 --> 03:10.442
<i>But by the time we were 30,
the next day would go like this.</i>

03:13.066 --> 03:16.366
<i>Then one day, in the throes of the worst
hangover of my life,</i>

03:16.492 --> 03:19.755
<i>I realized there was only one person
in the world that I could relate to:</i>

03:20.376 --> 03:23.250
<i>Detective Roger Murtaugh,
played by Danny Glover</i>

03:23.375 --> 03:25.434
<i>in the'80s noir masterpiece
Lethal Weapon,</i>

03:26.168 --> 03:28.291
<i>known for his
oft-quoted catchphrase:</i>

03:28.416 --> 03:30.196
- I'm too old for this...
- Stuff.

03:30.321 --> 03:32.778
<i>He said,
I'm too old for this stuff.</i>

03:33.454 --> 03:36.962
It's sad to admit, but as you get older,
there's things you can't do anymore.

03:37.130 --> 03:39.960
That's why I have this list, so
I never make the mistake of thinking

03:40.086 --> 03:42.307
that I can still
pull an all-nighter.

03:43.319 --> 03:45.171
I'm too old for that stuff.

03:45.983 --> 03:47.987
Or eat an entire pizza
in one sitting.

03:48.763 --> 03:50.615
I'm too old for that stuff.

03:51.468 --> 03:54.293
Or hang posters
on your wall without frames.

03:54.462 --> 03:55.463
"Riggs."

03:57.623 --> 03:59.475
I'm too old for that stuff.

03:59.977 --> 04:03.815
<i>- By the way, how good is Lethal Weapon?
- I don't know. It's kind of a rip-off.</i>

04:04.162 --> 04:06.804
Old guy paired up
with a young renegade cop.

04:06.929 --> 04:08.181
Sound familiar?

04:09.373 --> 04:10.623
<i>Mackleroy and LaFleur.</i>

04:12.128 --> 04:14.632
<i>Don't tell me you guys have never seen
Mackleroy and LaFleur.</i>

04:15.416 --> 04:18.390
It's the greatest Canadian
action movie of all time.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.700
Mackleroy is a young,
renegade Mountie

04:21.825 --> 04:24.070
whose horse was just killed
by evil Americans,

04:24.239 --> 04:27.662
while LaFleur, his grouchy,
old, African-Canadian partner,

04:27.830 --> 04:30.627
just bought a cozy ice fishing
shack in northern Alberta...

04:33.783 --> 04:36.808
- I got to go.
- Bye, baby. Have fun at practice.

04:36.976 --> 04:37.854
Practice?

04:37.979 --> 04:39.891
Is he doing that one-man
band thing again?

04:40.016 --> 04:41.695
'Cause that was a bummer.

04:42.226 --> 04:43.030
<i>Actually,</i>

04:43.557 --> 04:44.919
<i>He had just taken over</i>

04:45.044 --> 04:47.263
<i>as coach for Lily's
kindergarten basketball team.</i>

04:47.388 --> 04:51.397
<i>He thought it'd be fun, but Lily saw it
as something more: dad practice.</i>

04:51.523 --> 04:52.344
Hi.

04:52.885 --> 04:54.473
Hey! Oh, my gosh!

04:54.642 --> 04:56.437
Orange slices.
That is so sweet.

04:57.001 --> 04:59.064
- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't resist.

04:59.190 --> 05:01.574
I wanted to see
Coach Marshmallow do his thing.

05:03.940 --> 05:06.440
Hey, kids,
who wants to knock off early

05:06.565 --> 05:09.008
and have some of these here
orange slices?

05:09.176 --> 05:12.223
- Yeah!
- Yeah? Well, you can't!

05:12.487 --> 05:15.670
Because oranges are for winners,
and you little turds

05:15.795 --> 05:18.000
haven't even made a single shot yet!

05:18.125 --> 05:21.306
You're embarrassing yourselves,
you're embarrassing Ms. Aldrin,

05:21.431 --> 05:24.376
and worst of all,
you're embarrassing me!

05:24.672 --> 05:25.503
That's it!

05:25.780 --> 05:27.482
Suicides! Baseline! Now!

05:28.853 --> 05:29.693
Run.

05:32.538 --> 05:35.087
Ted, there is not
a single thing on here

05:35.212 --> 05:36.800
that you are too old to do.

05:36.925 --> 05:39.467
In fact, if you did
everything on the Murtaugh List,

05:39.592 --> 05:41.248
I'd call that a pretty fun weekend.

05:41.416 --> 05:43.244
Barney, you are not 18 anymore.

05:43.369 --> 05:46.092
If you did everything
on that list, you would die.

05:47.550 --> 05:50.450
- That wasn't a challenge.
- Challenge accepted.

05:50.575 --> 05:52.912
In the next 24 hours,
I'm going to do

05:53.037 --> 05:54.611
every single thing on this list.

05:54.978 --> 05:56.215
And after I do,

05:56.340 --> 05:59.457
you will TP
the laser tag place with me.

05:59.878 --> 06:02.628
- And if you can't do it?
- I will spend three hours

06:02.753 --> 06:05.554
listening to you
talk about architecture.

06:05.722 --> 06:09.277
You have got yourself a deal.
Robin, will you do the honors?

06:09.982 --> 06:11.684
A gentleman's agreement!

06:12.466 --> 06:14.591
All right, chumps, let's do this.

06:18.960 --> 06:21.542
You really want to make this bet
with him? You know how he is.

06:21.920 --> 06:24.482
There is some pretty
tough stuff on that list.

06:24.607 --> 06:27.480
I mean, do you really think
Barney's gonna get his ear pierced?

06:28.345 --> 06:29.902
"Get ear pierced."
Check.

06:30.502 --> 06:33.284
All right, I'm off to go
do laundry at Mom's house.

06:38.913 --> 06:40.885
You mind if I crash
on your futon tonight?

06:41.053 --> 06:43.850
- We don't have a futon.
- Put it over there, boys.

06:44.192 --> 06:46.431
- What's going on?
- It's on the Murtaugh List.

06:46.556 --> 06:49.489
"Crash on a friend's futon
instead of getting a hotel room."

06:50.336 --> 06:52.238
I am too old for that stuff.

06:52.705 --> 06:54.208
What's going on with your ear?

06:54.376 --> 06:56.714
Looks like the inside
of a jack-o'-lantern on November 3rd.

06:57.658 --> 07:00.111
What, this?
Ah, just a little infecsh.

07:00.470 --> 07:02.492
Nothing a young guy like me
can't shake off.

07:02.617 --> 07:05.150
Plus, "Put off going
to the doctor," on the list.

07:06.541 --> 07:07.542
Hold on.

07:09.257 --> 07:10.408
Go for Bar...

07:13.985 --> 07:15.136
Keep running!

07:15.926 --> 07:18.890
You know what's funny is, I was supposed
to come here to teach them...

07:19.197 --> 07:21.354
Do not stop running!

07:21.938 --> 07:24.987
This whole time, they've been
the ones who are teaching me.

07:28.651 --> 07:30.793
That's not running!
That's falling!

07:32.939 --> 07:36.314
<i>The next morning, Barney woke up
on the futon in our living room.</i>

07:42.193 --> 07:43.194
Check.

07:44.592 --> 07:46.695
"Drinking shots with strangers."

07:46.956 --> 07:47.915
Check.

07:49.004 --> 07:51.132
You OK, Barney?
It looks like you hurt your back.

07:51.300 --> 07:53.802
Oh, no.
Just rocking a party hunch.

07:54.229 --> 07:55.306
I like it.

07:55.611 --> 07:58.189
Closer to my booze.
To youth.

08:08.460 --> 08:09.862
Can I get a straw?

08:10.337 --> 08:12.166
I must say,
there's something admirable

08:12.291 --> 08:14.143
about the way he wants
to stay young at heart.

08:14.436 --> 08:17.150
- I mean, who wants to get old?
- This guy.

08:19.482 --> 08:22.579
Life is a meal
and old age is the dessert.

08:23.078 --> 08:25.363
I spend so much of my time
worrying about the future.

08:25.488 --> 08:27.644
Where's my career going?
Who am I gonna marry?

08:27.769 --> 08:29.799
But when you're old,
you don't worry,

08:29.925 --> 08:31.934
'cause all that stuff's
already happened.

08:32.416 --> 08:34.467
You get to wear comfy shoes
and a chair takes you up

08:34.592 --> 08:36.110
and down the stairs, it's perfect.

08:36.278 --> 08:38.407
That's not perfect.
That's pathetic.

08:38.575 --> 08:41.873
You can't just jump to the end.
The journey is the best part.

08:43.198 --> 08:44.795
I used to feel that way, too,

08:44.920 --> 08:47.633
but you'll understand
when you're a little bit older.

08:49.222 --> 08:51.907
Marshall, can you try
not to pick on the kids today.

08:52.033 --> 08:53.976
I'm not picking on the kids, Lily.

08:54.101 --> 08:56.573
I'm picking on the culture
of losing around here.

08:56.698 --> 08:58.063
I got to get them in shape

08:58.188 --> 08:59.882
if they're gonna win
that game tomorrow.

09:00.007 --> 09:01.008
Win?

09:01.565 --> 09:02.880
We don't keep score.

09:04.545 --> 09:06.889
- What?
- We don't keep score.

09:07.405 --> 09:08.857
You don't keep s...

09:09.990 --> 09:12.205
What's the point of playing
if you don't keep score?

09:12.330 --> 09:13.533
How do you know...

09:13.658 --> 09:16.411
Lily, what were you doing
with this team before I got here?

09:16.755 --> 09:17.915
I was coaching them.

09:19.244 --> 09:21.372
That's it, my little angels.

09:21.497 --> 09:24.439
You're all luminous
wonderful beings of light.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.854
- What's the score?
- It's all tied up at fun to fun!

09:30.755 --> 09:33.241
Because that's the point of playing,
to have fun.

09:33.501 --> 09:36.075
The point of playing
is to win the trophy.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.172
And if you don't know who's
winning, who gets the trophy?

09:39.340 --> 09:40.341
Everyone.

09:40.927 --> 09:44.225
It's a participation trophy,
everyone gets one.

09:45.149 --> 09:47.817
It's like you're speaking
Chinese to me right now.

09:49.909 --> 09:51.555
- Hi, this is Barney.
- And Robin.

09:51.680 --> 09:54.584
- We can't answer the phone because...
- He's watching sports and I'm...

09:54.709 --> 09:56.225
Probably out shopping.

09:57.362 --> 09:59.410
Leave a message,
we'll call you back just as soon...

09:59.535 --> 10:00.530
- As...
- We...

10:00.655 --> 10:01.598
Can!

10:02.591 --> 10:05.343
"Leave an annoying two-person message
on your answering machine."

10:05.463 --> 10:06.317
Check.

10:07.655 --> 10:10.243
Probably gonna cost me
some dates, but it's okay.

10:10.862 --> 10:12.678
Your ear's starting to smell.

10:13.315 --> 10:14.317
It's good.

10:15.674 --> 10:17.009
I hate to send it back,

10:17.178 --> 10:19.699
but you did describe the turkey
as extremely lean,

10:19.824 --> 10:21.938
and, well, you tell me.

10:23.608 --> 10:25.025
All right. That's it.

10:25.145 --> 10:26.698
- We have our own list.
- What?

10:27.007 --> 10:29.308
This is a list of things
you're too young to do.

10:29.434 --> 10:33.088
Go out and do each one of these things,
tell me you still want to be an old man.

10:34.741 --> 10:37.038
Remove "colonoscopy"
and "Have sex with an old lady",

10:37.163 --> 10:38.643
and this is a cakewalk.

10:40.556 --> 10:41.800
New stakes, then.

10:42.027 --> 10:44.389
If I can finish your list
before you finish mine,

10:44.514 --> 10:46.387
you have to come with me
to TP laser tag

10:46.512 --> 10:48.758
and you have to buy
the toilet paper.

10:48.883 --> 10:52.145
And none of that biodegradable crap.
I want it up there forever.

10:52.271 --> 10:54.575
Fine,
but if I finish your list first,

10:54.700 --> 10:56.082
it's a six hour survey

10:56.207 --> 10:58.153
of early 20th century
American architecture

10:58.279 --> 11:00.965
and you can never do anything
on the Murtaugh List ever again.

11:01.090 --> 11:03.701
- It's for your own good.
- You, sir, have got yourself a deal.

11:04.906 --> 11:06.536
A gentleman's agreement!

11:10.541 --> 11:14.298
Marshall, they're in kindergarten.
This isn't how you teach basketball.

11:14.673 --> 11:16.229
Sure it is. It's the way I learned.

11:16.865 --> 11:18.177
Are you kidding me?

11:18.302 --> 11:21.005
What kind of sociopath
taught you this way?

11:24.266 --> 11:26.044
Come on, Dad. I'm tired.

11:26.212 --> 11:27.507
Sleep is for winners.

11:27.632 --> 11:29.677
You can go to bed
when you score a basket.

11:29.845 --> 11:30.679
I'm trying.

11:30.848 --> 11:32.864
Let's give you
two points for trying.

11:32.989 --> 11:35.983
But negative two points
for having a great big head.

11:37.707 --> 11:40.034
My father gave me no quarter

11:40.603 --> 11:42.666
and I asked for no quarter.

11:44.546 --> 11:46.216
I totally got to call that guy.

11:47.536 --> 11:49.005
Keep stretching!

11:53.516 --> 11:55.821
"Put on reading glasses." Check.

11:56.395 --> 11:58.632
"Yell at neighborhood kids."

11:58.990 --> 12:00.168
My pleasure.

12:04.008 --> 12:07.315
- What the hell happened to you?
- I just had a very minor

12:07.440 --> 12:09.561
"blew out my knee
and it hurts like hell" incident.

12:09.864 --> 12:11.774
- How did you blow out your knee?
- We...

12:11.899 --> 12:15.657
"Helped someone move out of a 6th floor
walk-up in exchange for pizza and beer."

12:15.847 --> 12:18.160
Or we helped someone
rob a sixth floor walk-up.

12:18.285 --> 12:21.296
They were in a big hurry
and left all the pictures behind.

12:21.946 --> 12:23.342
Whatevs, it counts.

12:24.295 --> 12:27.498
Now, I am off to
"Dye my hair a funny color",

12:27.623 --> 12:29.940
and then we are going to,
"Go to a rave".

12:31.722 --> 12:32.446
4:00!

12:32.615 --> 12:33.616
Supper time.

12:35.221 --> 12:36.753
So, your dad was tough on you.

12:36.878 --> 12:39.506
That stinks,
but you don't have to be like him.

12:39.631 --> 12:41.718
You can learn from his mistakes.

12:41.886 --> 12:44.452
Mistakes?
Lily, scoreboard.

12:44.577 --> 12:46.853
The guy nailed it, okay?
He taught me how to be a winner.

12:47.380 --> 12:50.238
That's what I'm teaching these kids.
And, for that matter,

12:50.463 --> 12:52.493
that's what I'm gonna teach
our kids someday.

12:52.661 --> 12:53.870
Okay, that's it.

12:54.039 --> 12:56.219
This is not
how we're gonna raise our kids!

12:56.344 --> 12:58.841
And this is not
how you're gonna coach this team!

12:59.286 --> 13:02.061
At tomorrow's game,
if you are anything less

13:02.186 --> 13:05.609
than a teddy bear stuffed
with cotton candy and rainbows,

13:05.734 --> 13:08.925
I will silent treatment
your ass into the ground!

13:09.366 --> 13:11.685
You'll think the time I found
your Internet search history

13:11.810 --> 13:13.709
was a freakin' picnic!

13:13.979 --> 13:15.086
Are we clear?

13:17.000 --> 13:19.430
- There are many different philo...
- Are we clear?

13:19.598 --> 13:20.631
Yes, ma'am.

13:24.659 --> 13:26.279
What's ironic is that now...

13:33.605 --> 13:34.855
Just call Ted.

13:35.077 --> 13:36.478
I want to go home.

13:36.604 --> 13:38.381
All right.
I'm calling him.

13:38.506 --> 13:40.896
But it's 4:30 in the morning.
He's not going to be awake.

13:41.286 --> 13:42.376
Up at 4:00...

13:42.904 --> 13:43.770
Check.

13:45.199 --> 13:47.077
- Is he answering?
- I haven't dialed yet.

13:47.247 --> 13:48.953
Please hurry, Robin.

13:51.231 --> 13:52.232
Perfect.

13:52.515 --> 13:54.649
"Take forever to answer the phone."

13:58.479 --> 13:59.606
Come on, Ted.

13:59.775 --> 14:02.320
Someone gave me some aspirin
and I don't think it was aspirin.

14:09.386 --> 14:10.215
Check.

14:11.790 --> 14:14.703
So, I know that I have been
a little tough on you

14:14.828 --> 14:16.392
for the past couple days.

14:16.517 --> 14:19.133
And I apologize for that.

14:21.157 --> 14:23.718
So today, we're not gonna
worry about winning.

14:24.094 --> 14:25.666
We're gonna go out there and...

14:26.073 --> 14:27.074
have fun.

14:29.014 --> 14:31.743
<i>Kids, over the years,
your uncle Marshall has told and retold</i>

14:31.868 --> 14:34.854
<i>the story of this game
hundreds of times. And in reality,</i>

14:35.023 --> 14:37.801
<i>the kids on that other team
were probably only a grade older.</i>

14:37.926 --> 14:39.865
<i>But, in telling
and retelling the story,</i>

14:39.990 --> 14:41.892
<i>they came to look like this.</i>

14:53.779 --> 14:55.810
Way to let them score that easily.

14:55.935 --> 14:57.824
Now, you're sitting down.
Awesome.

15:03.768 --> 15:05.216
Addison, it's not soccer.

15:05.385 --> 15:06.886
You don't kick the ball!

15:08.673 --> 15:10.977
Unless that's something
that you think is fun,

15:11.102 --> 15:13.579
in which case, great job having fun.

15:18.164 --> 15:21.392
- That was a foul, wasn't it, Ref?
- My name's not Ref. It's Kenny.

15:21.518 --> 15:23.815
- And watch your tone.
- No tone, Kenny.

15:23.940 --> 15:24.928
Great job, Kenny.

15:25.334 --> 15:26.712
Thanks a lot, Kenny.

15:26.838 --> 15:28.390
See you later, Kenny.

15:28.647 --> 15:32.030
All right, Barney. As your manager,
I am throwing in the towel.

15:32.156 --> 15:34.493
This bet is over.
Your ear looks like

15:34.661 --> 15:37.077
a free Danish
at a continental breakfast.

15:39.292 --> 15:41.509
No. One thing left.
"Beer bong."

15:42.931 --> 15:44.170
Coming right up.

15:46.309 --> 15:47.187
Oh, I...

15:47.356 --> 15:50.310
found these weird Russian beers
in the basement.

15:50.722 --> 15:52.725
Russian beers?
I'll take a brewski.

15:53.851 --> 15:55.491
Brewski. Get it?

15:57.116 --> 15:58.046
Yeah, it's...

15:58.540 --> 16:01.052
It's a little warm.
Hope that's not a problem.

16:04.908 --> 16:06.356
No, don't, don't.

16:08.108 --> 16:10.783
All right, Ted.
You win. I hate this.

16:11.122 --> 16:12.746
I hate all of it.

16:12.915 --> 16:14.517
My back is killing me.

16:14.739 --> 16:16.630
Everyone at the rave
thought I was a narc.

16:17.322 --> 16:20.269
My ear hurts so bad I can hear it...

16:21.012 --> 16:23.565
I can hear my own ear.
Think about that.

16:24.985 --> 16:27.070
My clothes... What is it...
What is it... What am I...

16:27.195 --> 16:28.627
Get this stuff off of me!

16:28.747 --> 16:31.289
Ted, I'll pay you double
for your finest suit.

16:31.498 --> 16:32.499
Here's...

16:33.054 --> 16:34.055
30 bucks.

16:34.883 --> 16:36.676
And throw in the shoes.

16:37.384 --> 16:38.640
You win, Ted.

16:38.947 --> 16:41.594
I'll never do anything
on the Murtaugh List again.

16:41.981 --> 16:43.991
I'm too old for this stuff.

16:44.552 --> 16:47.523
You know, Barney, last night,
I went to bed at 8:00

16:47.648 --> 16:50.776
because it was on the list,
and I couldn't sleep because...

16:51.049 --> 16:52.356
well, it was 8:00.

16:52.718 --> 16:54.510
<i>So I decided to watch Lethal Weapon.</i>

16:57.725 --> 16:59.416
<i>And then,
when I still couldn't sleep,</i>

16:59.541 --> 17:01.294
<i>I watched Lethal Weapon 2.</i>

17:02.170 --> 17:03.607
<i>And then I watched 3.</i>

17:05.112 --> 17:07.247
<i>And then, halfway through
Lethal Weapon 4,</i>

17:07.415 --> 17:08.723
<i>is when it occurred to me...</i>

17:09.305 --> 17:12.625
Murtaugh kept saying,
"I'm too old for this stuff",

17:12.750 --> 17:14.190
but every time he'd say it,

17:14.315 --> 17:16.484
he'd turn around,
make another movie,

17:16.813 --> 17:18.022
and do more stuff.

17:19.402 --> 17:21.169
I guess what I'm saying is...

17:22.920 --> 17:23.910
screw being old.

17:25.763 --> 17:27.492
Let's go TP laser tag.

17:29.338 --> 17:30.927
And then the hospital.

17:34.418 --> 17:35.913
Great job, guys.

17:36.176 --> 17:38.805
At least we're not keeping score, right?
No idea what the score is.

17:38.930 --> 17:40.449
Could be 53 to zero.

17:40.617 --> 17:43.359
Could be some other score.
It's 53 to zero.

17:43.959 --> 17:45.669
What are we doing wrong, Coach?

17:46.749 --> 17:48.627
You know what?
You're not doing anything wrong.

17:48.752 --> 17:50.763
It's great that you guys are losing,

17:51.308 --> 17:54.649
because in life, it doesn't matter
how much effort you put in,

17:54.818 --> 17:56.320
or how hard you try,

17:56.457 --> 17:58.585
people will just give you things.

17:58.710 --> 18:02.028
Like diplomas and jobs
and promotions.

18:02.154 --> 18:04.064
So, it doesn't matter
what you do out there,

18:04.189 --> 18:06.440
as long as...
as long as you have fun.

18:07.101 --> 18:09.684
<i>At that point, because they didn't want
to fight in front of the kids,</i>

18:09.853 --> 18:13.710
<i>your uncle Marshall and aunt Lily had
one of their telepathic conversations.</i>

18:14.154 --> 18:17.128
<i>- Don't you give me that look.
- Lily, I can't take it anymore!</i>

18:17.254 --> 18:18.830
<i>Your way of coaching is crazy!</i>

18:18.999 --> 18:20.375
<i>Stop yelling at me!</i>

18:20.884 --> 18:21.886
<i>Sorry.</i>

18:22.547 --> 18:25.344
<i>But can I please do it my way?</i>

18:25.688 --> 18:28.414
<i>Fine, but I'm going
to do it my way, too.</i>

18:28.761 --> 18:29.897
<i>I'm getting my guitar.</i>

18:32.698 --> 18:34.718
<i>I don't know if it was
Marshall's tough attitude,</i>

18:34.844 --> 18:36.287
<i>Lily's gentle encouragement,</i>

18:36.455 --> 18:38.473
<i>or some magical combination
of the two,</i>

18:38.599 --> 18:40.164
<i>but in the second half of that game,</i>

18:40.289 --> 18:42.593
<i>that ragtag group
of little firecrackers...</i>

18:43.833 --> 18:45.488
<i>got beat down even worse.</i>

18:48.876 --> 18:50.946
<i>In fact, according
to your uncle Marshall,</i>

18:51.114 --> 18:53.354
<i>in the second half,
the other team got even taller.</i>

18:53.721 --> 18:56.000
<i>And one of them
turned into a Teen Wolf.</i>

18:56.126 --> 18:59.194
Kenny! There is a Teen Wolf
on the court!

18:59.319 --> 19:00.821
That can't be legal.

19:01.597 --> 19:03.545
I know the Teen Wolf
looks different, kids,

19:03.671 --> 19:06.338
but try to make sure
he feels included.

19:26.475 --> 19:28.587
How is that not traveling, Kenny?

19:28.712 --> 19:31.404
You are killing me!
You are absolutely killing me!

19:31.529 --> 19:33.626
Watch it, Coach,
or you'll get a technical.

19:35.473 --> 19:38.027
I am begging you
to give me a technical.

19:39.256 --> 19:41.436
<i>When the final horn mercifully blew,</i>

19:41.604 --> 19:44.757
<i>the score was,
by Marshall's estimate, 118 to nothing.</i>

19:45.242 --> 19:47.350
<i>And even though
they didn't win anything,</i>

19:47.475 --> 19:50.917
<i>everyone, even the coach,
got a participation trophy.</i>

19:51.085 --> 19:53.046
I understand if you don't want it.

19:54.836 --> 19:55.837
I love it.

19:58.053 --> 20:01.107
I worked so hard. It feels good
to be appreciated for my effort.

20:01.766 --> 20:03.028
I know, baby.

20:07.294 --> 20:10.086
Maybe your way
is not totally stupid.

20:10.577 --> 20:11.579
Thanks.

20:12.253 --> 20:14.180
Your way is totally stupid.

20:25.990 --> 20:26.991
Son...

20:28.367 --> 20:31.343
you have been a pain in my ass
ever since you joined this club.

20:33.626 --> 20:34.747
But damn it...

20:35.143 --> 20:38.217
if this ain't some
of the finest TP work I've ever seen.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.445
You're reinstated...

20:41.953 --> 20:43.245
effective immediately.

20:43.455 --> 20:44.456
Really?

20:47.834 --> 20:49.259
Hell, no!

20:50.263 --> 20:51.893
I'm calling the police!

20:52.185 --> 20:55.887
Grown-ass man with pink hair throwing
toilet paper. You're kidding me.

20:56.034 --> 20:57.686
<i>- I'm too old for this...
- Stuff.</i>

20:58.170 --> 20:59.364
<i>He said stuff.</i>
