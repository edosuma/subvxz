14:18.509 --> 14:19.946
Yeah, now we are.

14:19.989 --> 14:21.599
That's why we're sitting ona bunch of overstock

14:21.643 --> 14:23.253
so don't be so paranoid.

14:23.297 --> 14:25.995
- We're a team.
- No, no, no. We were a team.

14:26.039 --> 14:28.345
Now, that wetback,
her tattoo-necked cousin,

14:28.389 --> 14:31.696
and his junkie buddy,
that's our fucking team.

14:31.740 --> 14:34.264
You talk about herlike that again, and I'llhit you in your fucking mouth.

14:34.308 --> 14:37.789
- Yeah, I'm your fucking family.- Yeah, so is she.

14:37.833 --> 14:39.574
She's pregnant, man.

14:39.617 --> 14:42.620
[scoffs]
Congrats on your anchor baby.

14:50.193 --> 14:52.543
[Swift]I need to find a place to live.

14:52.587 --> 14:53.936
I need to find a new job.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.503
[Ticker] Well, aren't you lucky

14:55.546 --> 14:56.808
that you're good old friend,
Ticker,

14:56.852 --> 14:58.506
showed up just in time.

14:58.549 --> 14:59.986
Well, I'm trying to figure out

15:00.029 --> 15:02.249
if that's the God's work
or the Devil's work.

15:02.292 --> 15:03.903
[Ticker chuckles]What's the difference?

15:06.514 --> 15:08.037
These days, I don't know.

15:10.822 --> 15:12.172
What is this?

15:12.215 --> 15:14.043
Father O'Connell
finally convert you?

15:14.087 --> 15:15.871
You know me.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.526
Chapel was just a quiet placefor me to read my books.

15:18.569 --> 15:21.137
Ah, bullshit, the man
could preach like a Baptist.

15:21.181 --> 15:25.620
Yeah, he'd try and lecture meabout God's merciesand bible stories,

15:25.663 --> 15:31.408
but... I merely arguedthat if his God existed,

15:31.452 --> 15:34.977
then the animals in our bookswouldn't be so cruelto each other.

15:35.021 --> 15:39.503
So, I'm curious,
how did that conversation
with you and O'Connell go?

15:39.547 --> 15:41.592
There wasn't muchof a conversation.

15:41.636 --> 15:44.465
Turns out, I had a lot morebeefs than he had fables.

15:44.508 --> 15:45.945
You ain't right, man.

15:47.076 --> 15:50.123
I call it Profane Intervention.

15:51.863 --> 15:54.301
[rock music plays]

15:54.344 --> 15:58.131
[indistinct conversation]

15:58.174 --> 16:02.178
[narrator] And although hyenas have a reputation as thieves...

16:02.222 --> 16:04.920
...they are more than
capable predators.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.575
The matriarch
both dominates her pack,

16:07.618 --> 16:11.709
and fiercely defends it from the lions that stalk her cubs.

16:13.059 --> 16:15.409
[Maria] You need in here?

16:15.452 --> 16:18.064
When are yougoing to stop smoking?

16:18.107 --> 16:21.067
Whenever I'm not surrounded byall this extra weed.

16:21.110 --> 16:23.808
Well, once I sell itthen we'll take a vacation.

16:23.852 --> 16:26.637
Oh, yeah?
Every boy I've ever dated

16:26.681 --> 16:29.118
says that same thing,
"Waiting for the harvest."

16:29.162 --> 16:30.859
Never comes.

16:30.902 --> 16:32.513
Why don't you put on a shirt?

16:32.556 --> 16:34.210
We got all these thirsty-assguys running around here.

16:34.254 --> 16:35.907
I can't have 'emseeing all your goods.

16:35.951 --> 16:37.561
Oh yeah, don't tell me you'regetting jealous?

16:37.605 --> 16:39.128
I'll make an honest woman
out of you yet.

16:39.172 --> 16:40.303
Is that right?

16:40.347 --> 16:41.739
Mm-hm. Then you,
me and the baby,

16:41.783 --> 16:44.351
we'll take one of those safaris.

16:44.394 --> 16:46.831
What makes you think I even wantto bring a kid into this, huh?

16:48.529 --> 16:51.662
You believe everything
happens for a reason.

16:51.706 --> 16:53.360
[narrator] And this particular creature...

16:53.403 --> 16:55.231
- You do?
- Yeah.

16:58.582 --> 16:59.931
What do you believe in?

17:02.108 --> 17:04.066
Serendipity.

17:04.109 --> 17:07.026
Whenever she's aroundyou do whatever she says.

17:07.069 --> 17:08.505
Everything's about Maria
with you, huh?

17:08.549 --> 17:10.071
You fucking jealous?
Is that it?

17:10.116 --> 17:11.813
No, you're not getting my point,

17:11.856 --> 17:13.597
what I just said. Everything...

17:13.641 --> 17:15.598
No, so, whoa... Whoa, whoa,whoa, let me get this straight;

17:15.643 --> 17:17.513
I invested my college fund
into this,

17:17.558 --> 17:19.255
now you're just gonna
switch it up on me?

17:19.299 --> 17:20.821
We could triple our money.It was just an idea.

17:20.865 --> 17:22.171
Yeah, whose idea?

17:22.214 --> 17:23.912
[Maria]It's just a little weed, Caleb.

17:23.954 --> 17:27.220
Never hurt nobody,
no matter what state it's in.

17:27.262 --> 17:32.051
Hey, uh, not to intrude,
but we could get a couple
phony UPS trucks and--

17:32.094 --> 17:35.054
You don't own any of this, so,you don't have a say. I'm sorry.

17:35.097 --> 17:37.926
Why you walking
through our bedroom?

17:37.969 --> 17:39.493
My bad, man,
it was just quicker.

17:39.536 --> 17:41.756
Walk around next time.

17:41.799 --> 17:44.541
Yo, I can take the drive.
I'm down to do it.

17:44.585 --> 17:48.806
No, I invested in a business,not a fucking cartel. Fuck this!

17:50.765 --> 17:52.462
You promised.

17:52.506 --> 17:53.811
This little bitch.

17:56.162 --> 17:57.728
You know, it's not worthrisk right now,

17:57.772 --> 17:59.295
not with the copthat just came by.

17:59.339 --> 18:01.993
Come on, you know he's
just looking to get greased.

18:02.037 --> 18:05.171
No, I made up my mind.
We're not doing it.

18:07.434 --> 18:08.739
Thank you.

18:15.442 --> 18:18.053
You shouldn't havesaid that shit, man.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.229
Whatever, he was already
being a little pussy.

18:21.622 --> 18:24.581
I fucking knew it.

18:24.625 --> 18:26.496
It's time to go now,
but you know that, right?

18:26.540 --> 18:28.368
It's... it's time to go.

18:28.411 --> 18:31.284
I'm gonna stay.

18:31.327 --> 18:35.114
Adder, for once,
cut your losses.
Ticker's a fucking psycho.

18:35.157 --> 18:37.420
All the more reason
to get the money.

18:37.464 --> 18:39.292
We busted our asses
all fucking season.

18:39.335 --> 18:42.164
Nah, man.I'm packing my shit.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.210
I'm not tryingto bring this to my cousin.

18:44.253 --> 18:46.299
I gotta go back
to the crib real quick.

18:46.342 --> 18:50.085
I'll call you
and we'll talk it out.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.305
Yo, I don't want you bringing itto her either, all right!

19:00.226 --> 19:02.489
[Rob] Stupid! One little slip up and we're fucked.

19:02.532 --> 19:05.840
Everything that I built is over.

19:05.883 --> 19:09.104
And you won't even letsomeone else take the risk?

19:09.148 --> 19:11.237
It's not worth to risk.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.326
[scoffs]

19:13.369 --> 19:16.807
They're not afraid,
they know what they're doing.

19:16.851 --> 19:18.853
It's not about that.
I made a promise.

19:18.896 --> 19:21.203
Yeah, well, so much for this...

19:21.247 --> 19:22.900
What, you don't think I'd give
whatever to protect my kid?

19:22.944 --> 19:24.337
Give what, Rob?! What?!

19:24.380 --> 19:26.600
You don't have anything.You're broke.

19:32.258 --> 19:34.869
You know...

19:34.912 --> 19:40.962
...my dad died in the desert...so my mom and I would have abetter life.

19:44.052 --> 19:46.489
Me and Caleb stashed some cash
from the last harvest

19:46.533 --> 19:48.491
before the price dropped.

19:48.535 --> 19:50.493
All we have to do is wash it,
and we'll be fine.

19:50.537 --> 19:51.886
Everything's gonna be okay.

19:55.281 --> 19:56.804
Why didn't you tell me?

19:59.067 --> 20:00.286
I'm telling you now.

20:05.769 --> 20:06.814
[exhales]

20:06.857 --> 20:08.250
[rock music playing]

20:08.294 --> 20:11.122
These things just work
themselves out.

20:11.166 --> 20:12.254
Just... No.

20:12.298 --> 20:14.474
Look, no, look, look...

20:14.517 --> 20:16.737
We can't tell
your cousin just yet.

20:16.780 --> 20:20.871
Let's just keep it between us
until we figure things out,
okay?

20:20.915 --> 20:22.786
[sniffing]

20:26.834 --> 20:31.404
Well, tell Rob he can trim thatshit himself then!

20:31.447 --> 20:34.407
All right, all right.All right, all right, all right!

20:34.450 --> 20:37.018
I'm coming back now.

20:37.061 --> 20:38.585
- [phone beeps off]
- Fuck!

21:04.045 --> 21:05.351
Who the fuck are you?

21:19.626 --> 21:21.323
I didn't lose your base, man.

21:21.367 --> 21:24.283
It was...It was Diego, he burned it.

21:26.023 --> 21:28.112
[Ticker]
All right.

21:28.156 --> 21:30.637
Where is the cheeky bastard?

21:30.680 --> 21:33.074
He found out you were out.Skipped town.

21:33.117 --> 21:36.207
I stayed because I'm gonnapay off our debt.

21:36.251 --> 21:39.733
Aw...
That was awfully good of you.

21:39.776 --> 21:44.520
Smart, too. You should
never run from a predator.

21:44.564 --> 21:46.653
Let's them know you're prey.

21:46.696 --> 21:50.309
Now, where's my 50 G's?

21:50.352 --> 21:55.226
Fifty?We owe you 15, man.

21:55.270 --> 21:58.839
Well, the clock's been
tick-tick-ticking, hasn't it?

21:58.882 --> 22:00.971
[wincing]

22:01.015 --> 22:03.104
Yo, Tick, what are you doing?

22:03.147 --> 22:05.498
I... I can get it.More than that.

22:10.459 --> 22:11.547
My bosses grow!

22:11.591 --> 22:12.983
He's... he's... he's got

22:13.027 --> 22:15.290
five timesmore than that up there.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.248
Oh, yeah?

22:17.292 --> 22:20.382
Mate, they're just criminals.

22:20.426 --> 22:23.951
They're not gonna
call the police on you.

22:23.994 --> 22:26.214
- If there's as much
as he says there is--
- There is!

22:26.257 --> 22:28.521
If there is...

22:30.087 --> 22:31.350
...you can have half.

22:35.571 --> 22:36.572
All right.

22:44.711 --> 22:46.756
[dog barking in distance]

23:03.904 --> 23:05.949
[Caleb] I wanna thank you
for what you did earlier.

23:06.907 --> 23:08.474
It means a lot.

23:08.517 --> 23:10.432
Don't worry about it.

23:10.476 --> 23:13.566
When I made t-shirts,
you wore every one of them.

23:15.829 --> 23:19.180
When I tried landscaping,you picked up a shovel.

23:19.223 --> 23:22.923
Yeah, I'm still shoveling.

23:22.966 --> 23:26.317
Yeah, but I didn't want you
following me back here,
you know that, right?

23:26.361 --> 23:28.319
I don't regret it.

23:28.363 --> 23:30.670
But you should be
figuring it out for yourself.

23:30.713 --> 23:32.628
What does that mean?

23:32.672 --> 23:36.023
You don't need this bullshit.

23:36.066 --> 23:38.895
You can go back to school.
I can cash you out.

23:38.939 --> 23:41.245
I don't care about any of that.

23:41.289 --> 23:45.249
All I care aboutis this season being overand us being good again.

23:45.293 --> 23:48.165
This game's not for everybody,
you have to live this shit.

23:57.523 --> 23:59.263
Then we'll do like you said.

24:01.918 --> 24:03.572
We'll cross state lines.

24:07.315 --> 24:09.317
I don't even know
if I want to do that anymore.

24:11.711 --> 24:13.103
[exhales]

24:13.147 --> 24:14.409
I just want me, her and the baby

24:14.453 --> 24:15.584
to have a real spot, you know?

24:18.718 --> 24:20.328
Yo, yo, Maria?

24:29.293 --> 24:30.643
[door opens]

24:32.558 --> 24:35.038
[Swift] So, it's definitelyjust the three of them up there.

24:35.082 --> 24:37.388
The kid brother,
the guy and his girl?

24:37.432 --> 24:39.695
Mm-hm. Yeah.

24:39.739 --> 24:41.436
Yeah, that's some bullshit.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.220
Hey, yo, Tick,let this motherfucker know about

24:43.264 --> 24:44.874
the bird you was
telling me about.

24:45.788 --> 24:47.486
The shrike.

24:50.576 --> 24:55.102
It's a cute little thing,
about the size of a robin.

24:55.145 --> 25:00.586
Has a black stripeacross its eyes,makes it look like a wee bandit.

25:00.629 --> 25:02.196
Stop me if you know
what it does.

25:04.241 --> 25:05.373
Do you know?

25:06.113 --> 25:07.114
No.

25:07.984 --> 25:09.551
It plucks...

25:11.988 --> 25:17.864
...bugs, mice, other little
birds out of their homes

25:17.907 --> 25:21.128
and impales them
on thorns and barb wire.

25:22.346 --> 25:25.567
Snakes, too.I gotta take a piss.

25:31.094 --> 25:33.096
[door shuts]

25:33.140 --> 25:36.099
[Ticker]
Aye, snakes, too.

25:38.275 --> 25:41.061
'Cause nobody likes a fucking
snake, do they?

25:49.635 --> 25:51.419
What do you think it does then?

25:55.205 --> 25:56.598
Eats them.

25:56.642 --> 25:57.991
Sometimes, aye.

26:05.389 --> 26:08.175
[whispering]
What the fuck are you doing?

26:08.218 --> 26:14.616
Other times, it likes to take
its prey apart piece by piece,

26:14.660 --> 26:20.535
so it can make these wee trophy
displays, to attract mates.

26:38.422 --> 26:40.120
It's just the way they are.

26:41.208 --> 26:42.296
[car door shuts]

26:46.126 --> 26:47.736
Way they was made.

26:50.739 --> 26:54.743
So, one last time;
no alarms, and no surprises.

26:56.702 --> 26:59.574
It's up thereabout a half-mile on the right.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.620
[engine starts]

27:09.671 --> 27:12.021
[Caleb]
Yeah, about that.

27:14.154 --> 27:16.417
I'm really sorryfor what I said earlier.

27:17.418 --> 27:18.593
I didn't mean it.

27:20.203 --> 27:22.162
I'll try to be nicer, I promise.

27:23.337 --> 27:24.947
It's not about that.

27:24.991 --> 27:27.776
You and Maria are gonna be fine.

27:27.820 --> 27:30.823
And for the record,
she suggested giving you
a bigger cut.

27:35.741 --> 27:41.398
Hey, cuz.I got... I gotta go.I can't stay here.

27:41.442 --> 27:43.444
Where are you running off to?

27:43.487 --> 27:46.577
I'm not running.I just...

27:46.621 --> 27:48.623
I can't be here.

27:48.667 --> 27:49.755
Why?

27:51.147 --> 27:52.148
[speaking Spanish]

27:54.107 --> 27:55.935
This season's all messed up,you know,

27:55.978 --> 27:58.807
and I'm not just gonnasit around for itto get worse, so...

28:00.243 --> 28:02.245
[speaking Spanish]

28:08.251 --> 28:10.123
I've done thisfor you twice, now.

28:11.646 --> 28:13.430
You think I want

28:13.474 --> 28:15.345
You always have
a place here, man.

28:15.389 --> 28:16.520
This is our home.

28:18.392 --> 28:21.090

Let's go.

28:59.520 --> 29:02.566
Cut through there...
bring us right behind
the compound.

29:04.351 --> 29:06.745
Yeah, okay, motherfucker.

29:06.788 --> 29:08.224
Remember what I said in the car.

29:28.244 --> 29:30.246
What's with all this?

29:30.290 --> 29:32.466
- Just for show.
- Just for show?

29:34.947 --> 29:37.514
Well, if that's howit's gonna be, man,don't leave me empty-handed.

29:42.476 --> 29:44.086
[Ticker]Get the fuck out of here.

29:45.261 --> 29:46.567
Fuckin' clown.

29:50.614 --> 29:53.966
[Caleb] For the record,
I'm not taking a bigger cut.

29:54.009 --> 29:57.056
You gotta fix the house up,properly this time.

29:57.099 --> 29:58.840
All right.

29:58.884 --> 30:01.016
I'll fix the tree housebefore I go.

30:02.713 --> 30:04.803
She gotta learn
how to walk first.

30:06.456 --> 30:07.849
She?

30:07.893 --> 30:09.503
I just got a feeling,you know.

30:22.342 --> 30:26.694
[Adder] Brother usually chills

30:29.523 --> 30:32.787
[Ticker]
You two circle around back.

30:32.831 --> 30:36.225
I'll take the kiddie's place,
we'll meet up front.

30:50.761 --> 30:53.242
Don't worry aboutthe fucking gun, worry about me.

30:53.286 --> 30:54.330
Let's go.

31:03.949 --> 31:06.255
Just pack a bag,you can come with me.

31:06.299 --> 31:09.302
[scoffs]
You don't even have the balls
to tell me why you're leaving.

31:16.875 --> 31:23.098
That guy me and Adder burned...he's out, and I can't risk himfinding me.

31:29.235 --> 31:32.412
[Ticker]
Cunt said he'd be here.

31:32.455 --> 31:35.197
Fine.
If you're scared then just go.

31:35.241 --> 31:38.940
[speaking Spanish]

31:38.984 --> 31:42.248
I wanna stay...I wanna stay with you.

31:42.291 --> 31:44.119
I just can't.

31:44.163 --> 31:45.773
[speaking Spanish]

31:48.428 --> 31:50.343
What's going on?

31:50.386 --> 31:54.608
Says he's leaving.
No endurance for it.

31:54.651 --> 31:56.740
Look, I meant what I said.
If that means
you're done here...

31:56.784 --> 31:58.438
It is what it is, man.

31:58.481 --> 32:00.919
Uh, can I take a few a totesas payment, or what?

32:06.272 --> 32:09.710
Don't look at me.
I'd make him beg for it.

32:13.801 --> 32:14.889
Take three.

32:27.771 --> 32:30.383
I thought he was just frustratedwaiting on the yield.

32:31.775 --> 32:35.518
No...
He insists he's in trouble.

32:40.175 --> 32:41.568
Could've come to me about it.

32:42.569 --> 32:44.005
I coulda helped.

32:44.049 --> 32:46.921
I mean, at least,I coulda paid the difference.

32:46.965 --> 32:49.271
It's okay, babe.
Don't worry about it.

32:55.060 --> 32:56.496
Talked to Caleb.

32:56.539 --> 32:58.411
Yeah, about what?

32:59.803 --> 33:02.023
About possibly,uh, buying him out.

33:06.071 --> 33:07.942
How'd he take it?

33:07.986 --> 33:09.596
Surprisingly well.

33:09.639 --> 33:10.727
Better than I thought.

33:14.514 --> 33:17.299
I guess it's gonna be
just you and me from now on.

33:17.343 --> 33:18.561
We'll take care of everything.

33:22.783 --> 33:24.002
You gonna trim?

33:24.045 --> 33:25.394
I can trim.

33:25.438 --> 33:27.092
I'd rather learn
how to grow though.

33:28.832 --> 33:30.399
When you gonna learnhow to do that?

33:32.314 --> 33:34.925
Mm... I was thinking
you could teach me now.

33:36.405 --> 33:38.277
- Now?
- Yes.

33:38.320 --> 33:39.408
Like, right now?

33:40.757 --> 33:41.802
Okay.

34:08.002 --> 34:09.351
Mm...

34:09.395 --> 34:10.744
It's so sweet.

34:12.353 --> 34:16.880
When the females flower
they grow these colas,

34:16.924 --> 34:19.666
which are a cluster of buds.

34:19.708 --> 34:25.585
When the males flower it
produces pollen,
which impregnates those colas.

34:26.672 --> 34:28.152
Sounds familiar.

34:28.196 --> 34:30.938
[chuckles]Yeah, but we don't want that

34:30.981 --> 34:33.114
because all that doesis give them seeds, right?

34:38.946 --> 34:41.121
-[Maria] Mm.
-[Rob]
So, to get the product right,

34:41.166 --> 34:46.214
we cut down all the males beforethey can ruin the females.

34:47.389 --> 34:49.870
So, we kill off all the males.

34:49.913 --> 34:51.741
I thinkI'm starting to like this.

34:51.784 --> 34:53.438
You would,
you smoke enough of it.

35:01.316 --> 35:03.231
Jesus Christ.

35:06.843 --> 35:09.846
They storing all this shit
for a reason?

35:09.890 --> 35:14.851
[Adder] Too much product
on the West Coast.
Can't shift it.

35:14.895 --> 35:17.854
So, at this point,there's not much to do besidespull the tents

35:17.898 --> 35:20.466
so we can changetheir day and night cycle.

35:20.509 --> 35:25.993
- So, we just feed them, watchthem grow and then harvest them.- Pretty much.

35:26.036 --> 35:29.127
[Swift] I can get six G'sfor one of these in Detroit.

35:29.170 --> 35:31.129
[Ticker]Detroit's a long ways from here.

35:32.173 --> 35:33.479
Where is everybody?

35:33.522 --> 35:35.437
[Swift]Who cares. Where's the paper?

35:35.481 --> 35:37.135
[Adder] It's... It's gotta
be in the private room

35:37.178 --> 35:38.527
but they have the key.

35:38.571 --> 35:40.834
[Ticker] Oh, that's okay.

35:40.877 --> 35:42.879
Brought my lock-pick.

35:42.923 --> 35:44.751
We can't open up a safe
without them anyhow.

35:44.794 --> 35:46.579
Let's just find the kid.

35:46.622 --> 35:49.277
[Adder] They have to bein one of the greenhouses.

35:49.321 --> 35:51.932
[Ticker]
Aye. They better be.

36:02.769 --> 36:05.598
The nursery is wherethe real work is.

36:05.641 --> 36:08.688
The younger they are,then the moreyou have to nurture them.

36:08.731 --> 36:10.124
But I like that part though.

36:16.783 --> 36:19.220

46:38.578 --> 46:40.188
They didn't let you
have one, huh?

46:40.232 --> 46:42.800
Hey, let me take care of it.

46:42.843 --> 46:44.279
No, she's right.
He's nervous.

46:44.323 --> 46:45.977
Caleb! Come on, man.

46:46.020 --> 46:48.544
Come on, man.You're nothing like them.

46:48.588 --> 46:51.330
And... and I need you.I need you, mate.

46:51.373 --> 46:53.854
Come on, let's get this dough.Let's get this money.

46:56.422 --> 46:58.424
Make me...
[speaks Spanish]

46:58.467 --> 46:59.773
Shut up.

47:05.648 --> 47:08.260
What are you doing? Hey! Hey!What are you doing with those?!

47:08.303 --> 47:10.523
[yelling indistinct]

47:14.135 --> 47:17.138
No more dead bodies...
or I'm outta here.

47:21.882 --> 47:26.060
See? See?No problem. No problem.

47:29.629 --> 47:32.414
What are you doing?!What the fuck are youdoing with those, huh?

47:32.458 --> 47:33.938
Don't you fucking dare.

47:41.815 --> 47:42.947
What are you doing now?

47:42.990 --> 47:45.688
Now, why don't youmove the truck--

47:45.732 --> 47:47.255
No, go on and get that truck.

47:47.299 --> 47:48.953
You go up there
and get the truck.

47:48.996 --> 47:50.824
I ain't running my ass
up that hill twice.

47:53.131 --> 47:54.219
Fair played.

48:02.836 --> 48:05.970
What the fuck are you doing,
Maria?

48:06.013 --> 48:09.364
I said I'll take care of him.
Don't be sucking his fucking
finger off.

48:09.408 --> 48:11.410
- [crunch]
- [groans]

48:11.453 --> 48:15.066
[door opens, closes]

48:15.109 --> 48:16.415
That's what you get.

48:19.287 --> 48:21.072
[Swift]
Sit down somewhere.

48:21.115 --> 48:23.030
You is a weird motherfucker,
you know that?

48:26.164 --> 48:27.992
All right, everybody, listen up.

48:28.035 --> 48:31.604
Your friend got stupid,
and then he got dead.

48:31.647 --> 48:33.693
But nobody else
needs to get hurt.

48:33.736 --> 48:36.304
Just tell us where it is,
then we're gone.

48:36.348 --> 48:38.437
Where's what?

48:38.480 --> 48:41.962
Did you just not hear
what the fuck I said
about being stupid?

48:42.006 --> 48:45.183
This is all we got, man.I know it's not a lot.

48:45.226 --> 48:48.708
Nah. Somebody's lying.

48:50.753 --> 48:53.017
Yeah. Maybe it's him.

49:09.207 --> 49:11.383
[grunting]

49:17.302 --> 49:20.174
[Swift] Listen, man,
you know what's gonna happen

49:20.218 --> 49:22.394
if my friend comes back
and I don't have an answer?

49:22.437 --> 49:24.352
He's gonna kill us all anyway.

49:33.361 --> 49:34.841
Probably you, too.

49:34.884 --> 49:37.322
[Ticker]
Who's he think he is...

49:37.365 --> 49:40.542
...talking to you like that?

49:40.586 --> 49:43.415
Only reason he's breathing
is 'cause of you.

49:45.199 --> 49:47.941
[breathes deeply]

49:47.985 --> 49:49.943
Think about it.He's already killed my cousin.

49:49.987 --> 49:51.771
He's got nothing to lose.

49:51.814 --> 49:54.687
Do you really think he's gonnashare that money with you?

49:58.778 --> 50:01.041
Baby girl, let me let you
in on a little secret.

50:01.085 --> 50:03.000
What?

50:03.043 --> 50:06.394
He ain't my problem, he's yours.

50:06.438 --> 50:10.268
No, he's right. He's right.
He's right.

50:10.311 --> 50:13.967
Gotta stay cool. Stay cool.
Get that dough.

50:14.011 --> 50:17.101
[engine starts]

50:17.144 --> 50:22.628
Nah. You're manso.Too tame.

50:22.671 --> 50:24.543
Baby, stop. Shh.

50:24.586 --> 50:26.719
- We're already dead anyway!
- Both of you, shut up!

50:26.762 --> 50:28.242
Hey, don't talk to me like that.

50:28.286 --> 50:29.809
[Swift]
Everybody, shut the fuck up!

50:30.679 --> 50:32.029
It's not right.

50:33.595 --> 50:36.511
Why did he not send that skinnywee poof to move the truck?

50:39.253 --> 50:41.429
[Swift]
Get up, man. Get up!

50:42.474 --> 50:44.084
Get the fuck up!

50:44.128 --> 50:46.260
Where's the safe, man, huh?
Where's the keys?

50:46.304 --> 50:48.480
Where's the safe?!

50:48.523 --> 50:50.525
Where is it?!

50:50.569 --> 50:52.527
Caleb, I already told him
it was in the tool shed,

50:52.571 --> 50:55.791
just tell him
where you moved it!

50:55.835 --> 50:58.055
You should leave
before the cops come, man.

51:03.582 --> 51:05.279
I know you didn't
call the cops, man.

51:07.194 --> 51:09.805
He must think
he's smarter than you.

51:09.849 --> 51:11.677
He's not smarter than you.

51:11.720 --> 51:14.854
[muttering quietly]

51:14.897 --> 51:16.116
Fuck!

51:18.553 --> 51:19.946
He called 12, man.

51:22.383 --> 51:24.646
The call went through,
they'll come
and check it out anyway.

51:25.734 --> 51:26.735
[grunts]

51:27.997 --> 51:29.608
[Swift]
Hey, uh, yo Tick, man.

51:31.175 --> 51:32.654
We're on the clock now.

51:33.699 --> 51:36.919
So, one more time...

51:38.443 --> 51:40.271
...where's the fucking safe?

51:42.447 --> 51:48.279
Where's... the fucking... safe?

51:48.322 --> 51:51.717
Huh?
You're gonna tell me.

51:51.760 --> 51:54.372
- [Swift]
Hey, uh, yo, Tick, man...
- Where's the safe?

51:54.415 --> 51:56.200
[Swift] Let's just get
the fuck outta here, man.

51:58.550 --> 51:59.812
Stop.

51:59.855 --> 52:01.248
- [grunts]
- [yelling]

52:01.292 --> 52:04.164
Caleb! Caleb! You motherfucker!

52:05.513 --> 52:07.385
You son of a bitch!

52:23.662 --> 52:25.446
Look what youse made me do.

52:27.535 --> 52:30.495
Go take care of that body out
front, and load the truck.

52:48.121 --> 52:51.037
[Adder] You know she's right,
this is fucked!

52:51.080 --> 52:52.734
[Swift]
Is that money up there or not?

52:52.778 --> 52:54.214
[Adder]
Somewhere, but fuck this.

52:54.258 --> 52:56.260
Let's just roll
before the cops come.

52:56.303 --> 52:58.305
Look, I know you don't
want to go back inside.

52:58.349 --> 53:00.655
[Swift] I ain't leaving here
empty-handed.

53:00.699 --> 53:03.049
[Adder] I can move the weed,
get us paid.

53:03.092 --> 53:05.660
Come on, fuck the safe,
it'll take too much time.

53:05.704 --> 53:08.707
[Swift]
Nah, Ticker won't go for it.

53:16.802 --> 53:18.238
[Adder]
You got a gun.

53:18.282 --> 53:19.544
You could dropthat crazy fuck

53:19.587 --> 53:21.023
before he even knewwhat was going on.

53:21.067 --> 53:22.068
[Swift]Motherfucker, I don't know you,

53:22.111 --> 53:23.330
and I don't trust you.

53:25.854 --> 53:27.160
No, no.

53:27.204 --> 53:28.335
[Ticker grunts]

53:28.379 --> 53:30.381
Oh, by the way,

53:30.424 --> 53:33.340
great idea
sticking youse in there.

53:33.384 --> 53:34.559
The closet.

53:36.038 --> 53:38.345
[door creaks]

53:38.389 --> 53:40.521
I don't know where it is!

53:40.565 --> 53:45.222
Well, maybe, if you think reallyhard, you'll be able to guess.

53:47.224 --> 53:50.618
You just killed the only personwho knew where it is.

53:53.578 --> 53:55.406
No, no, no...

54:05.720 --> 54:08.767
[Adder] You... you really think
he's gonna give you half?

54:08.810 --> 54:11.509
[Swift] You ain't neverbeen on the inside, I can tell.

54:11.552 --> 54:13.815
[Adder] Yeah, yeah,
that's right, 'cause I'm smart.

54:13.859 --> 54:15.469
[Swift] Nah, that ain't it atall.

54:15.513 --> 54:17.036
You're just too muchof a coward pussy

54:17.079 --> 54:19.168
to do anything worthgetting sent up for anyway.

54:19.212 --> 54:22.955
Ticker's batshit crazy,I'll give you that,but he ain't no liar.

54:22.998 --> 54:24.522
He'll give me mine.

54:24.565 --> 54:27.829
[Adder]Yeah, yeah, good luck with that.

54:27.873 --> 54:30.223
You better get your ass
inside that damn room.

54:43.671 --> 54:47.371
[panting]

54:47.414 --> 54:49.329
Please, don't hurt her.

54:49.373 --> 54:51.505
Hurt her?

54:51.549 --> 54:53.377
[clicking tongue]

54:53.420 --> 54:58.382
I'm going to make her feel
really... really good.

55:00.645 --> 55:02.037
Please, she's pregnant.

55:05.563 --> 55:06.738
Is that right?

55:11.830 --> 55:17.052
When a lion takes over another'spride, you know what he does?

55:18.402 --> 55:19.838
Do you know?

55:20.665 --> 55:22.057
First thing:

55:25.931 --> 55:30.022
He kills all his rival's cubs.

55:31.589 --> 55:35.636
It forces the females into heat.

55:35.680 --> 55:40.206
Can he help but mate with them,over and over again?

55:53.915 --> 55:55.656
I almost forgot I gave you that.

56:01.096 --> 56:02.315
Thanks, mate.

56:09.409 --> 56:10.758
Come on, then, love.

56:10.802 --> 56:13.108
[sighs]Let's have some fun.

56:13.152 --> 56:14.240
Come on.

56:14.283 --> 56:15.807
[shrieking]

56:15.850 --> 56:19.724
No! Stop! Stop!
No! No! No!

56:19.767 --> 56:21.726
[shrieking]

56:23.815 --> 56:25.773
[Maria] Baby, do something!

56:26.774 --> 56:27.993
Baby!

56:31.692 --> 56:33.215
[Swift]Then you got two choices:

56:33.259 --> 56:35.043
Tell us where that safe is,

56:35.087 --> 56:37.089
or beg me to put youout of your misery.

56:37.132 --> 56:39.787
Huh?What's it gonna be?!

56:42.660 --> 56:45.053
Let's go!
Gotta show you something.

56:45.097 --> 56:46.620
The cave! The cave!

56:46.664 --> 56:48.622
[Swift]
Tick!

56:48.666 --> 56:51.059
The cave! He just found it!
It's gotta be there!

56:51.103 --> 56:52.147
I know it's there!

56:54.585 --> 56:56.630
Take your time.

56:56.674 --> 56:59.328
It's in the cave.
It's in the cave.

56:59.372 --> 57:00.765
- It's in there.
- [Swift] Get up.

57:05.465 --> 57:06.901
[Maria] Let me go!

57:37.454 --> 57:38.629
Come on in.

57:44.635 --> 57:46.114
Enjoy the show.

58:44.521 --> 58:47.306
[Swift]
You seem like the smart one.
Keep it that way,

58:47.349 --> 58:49.003
and there's chance
you'll survive all this.

58:49.047 --> 58:50.396
No, there ain't.

58:52.833 --> 58:55.140
Just let my kid
have that chance.

58:58.099 --> 58:59.100
Keep walking.

59:08.022 --> 59:09.546
Oh...

59:10.808 --> 59:12.984
I guess you're not in heat yet.

59:15.160 --> 59:18.337
Might have torip out that cub, hey?

59:18.380 --> 59:21.122
You always talk this much
before you fuck?

59:24.430 --> 59:27.346
[laughing]

59:29.478 --> 59:31.089
Where did they find you?

59:37.922 --> 59:39.488
[engine shuts off]

59:39.532 --> 59:41.360
[radio chatter indistinct]

59:54.634 --> 59:56.462
[speaking Spanish]

01:00:05.297 --> 01:00:07.168
[stuttering]

01:00:07.212 --> 01:00:10.084
Did she just...Did you just call me a wolf?

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:18.223
Prison wolf. Straight boy
who fucks ass inside.

01:00:20.791 --> 01:00:22.096
[knocking]

01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:24.664
But you ain't even that,
are you?

01:00:30.583 --> 01:00:31.671
[sheriff]
County sheriff.

01:00:31.715 --> 01:00:33.151
Get that fuck!

01:00:45.424 --> 01:00:46.991
[knocking]

01:00:52.083 --> 01:00:55.086
Take off your clothes.

01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:16.194
County sheriff, open up!

01:01:19.066 --> 01:01:21.895
What's with all the noise?
We're...
we're trying to work here.

01:01:23.767 --> 01:01:25.246
Slow.

01:01:25.290 --> 01:01:26.421
Get out here.

01:01:30.121 --> 01:01:31.296
[Swift]
Keep walking.

01:01:33.124 --> 01:01:34.908
How much further?

01:01:34.952 --> 01:01:37.476
It's a little ways.

01:01:37.519 --> 01:01:40.218
I heard how you reacted
when Diego got shot.

01:01:42.742 --> 01:01:45.527
Where's the owner
and his brother?

01:01:45.571 --> 01:01:47.312
Uh, owner is out,

01:01:47.355 --> 01:01:50.707
and his brother kinda doeshis own thing, so, I don't know.

01:01:52.752 --> 01:01:53.710
You sure about that?

01:01:55.755 --> 01:01:59.933
I don't know whatyou're getting at, sheriff, but,uh, to be honest,

01:01:59.977 --> 01:02:03.502
I'm a... I'm a little stoned.

01:02:03.545 --> 01:02:05.765
You led my little brotherright to him, man.

01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:07.811
He was just a kid.

01:02:07.854 --> 01:02:10.204
Look, the last thing I
wanted

01:02:10.248 --> 01:02:11.771
was for anybody to get hurt.

01:02:11.815 --> 01:02:13.773
Now, I'm sorry
about your brother.

01:02:13.817 --> 01:02:15.775
But there's nothing
we can do about that now.

01:02:15.819 --> 01:02:17.037
Now move.

01:02:18.517 --> 01:02:19.518
Move!

01:02:21.172 --> 01:02:23.304
See, I got a call from up here.

01:02:23.348 --> 01:02:25.611
More than one actually.

01:02:25.654 --> 01:02:28.832
Number's come up
registered to Hayes.

01:02:28.875 --> 01:02:30.485
Oh, Caleb, yeah, yeah.

01:02:30.529 --> 01:02:32.226
He said he was
trying to call you about that,

01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:33.662
uh, that, paper work.

01:02:33.706 --> 01:02:35.882
Had some questions.

01:02:35.926 --> 01:02:37.754
He called 911 for that?

01:02:39.581 --> 01:02:41.975
The dispatch thought
she heard gunshots.

01:02:43.977 --> 01:02:46.893
Maybe he was
reporting some poachers.

01:02:46.937 --> 01:02:48.895
You know, there's a lot
of wildlife up here, you know?

01:02:53.030 --> 01:02:54.031
It's right there.

01:02:59.950 --> 01:03:02.256
O Lord, Jesus Christ,
please forgive his sins,

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:04.476
just as You forgave those
who crucified You.

01:03:04.519 --> 01:03:05.607
Stop. Get up.

01:03:05.651 --> 01:03:06.826
Count not the transgressions,

01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:08.001
but rather his tears of
repentance.

01:03:08.045 --> 01:03:09.611
I said get up!

01:03:09.655 --> 01:03:11.135
For he knows not
what he's gonna do, please.

01:03:11.178 --> 01:03:12.789
Look!

01:03:12.832 --> 01:03:16.880
Look, man, you do this for me,I promise you,

01:03:16.923 --> 01:03:19.534
I'll pop off a shotand let him think you're dead.

01:03:19.578 --> 01:03:22.450
It'll all be over.You understand?

01:03:22.494 --> 01:03:24.191
Yeah, but since the calls
came from this property,

01:03:24.235 --> 01:03:26.846
that gives me probable cause
to look inside.

01:03:26.890 --> 01:03:31.372
With all due respect, sheriff,
that doesn't sound right.

01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:35.246
Right?

01:03:35.289 --> 01:03:38.510
You mean using, selling drugs,
that kinda right?

01:03:38.553 --> 01:03:40.207
I don't wanna go back to prison.

01:03:42.514 --> 01:03:44.124
I'm not a bad man.

01:03:44.168 --> 01:03:46.779
I never have been.

01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:48.825
But I need this lick, man.

01:03:48.868 --> 01:03:50.827
All right?

01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:54.221
The code's 4-9-2-9.

01:03:54.265 --> 01:03:58.138
I'm not going in there.
Whatever happens in that cave
is between you and God.

01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:08.061
Hey, you know,
marijuana's legal now.

01:04:09.715 --> 01:04:11.543
We're paying your salary.

01:04:11.586 --> 01:04:12.761

01:04:33.086 --> 01:04:34.087
Have a seat.

01:04:36.046 --> 01:04:37.612
Do it!

01:04:37.656 --> 01:04:39.701
We had a bachelor party
last night.

01:04:39.745 --> 01:04:41.399
You know something,

01:04:41.442 --> 01:04:44.141
getting kinda sick of listening
to your bullshit.

01:04:46.273 --> 01:04:47.535
Shit.

01:04:47.579 --> 01:04:48.885
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:04:55.979 --> 01:04:57.719
Bag. You got a bag?

01:05:16.695 --> 01:05:17.783
What's in there?

01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:19.828
It's just a closet.

01:05:21.308 --> 01:05:22.440
[Rob]
Almost done.

01:05:25.573 --> 01:05:27.314
Keep 'em comin'.

01:05:27.358 --> 01:05:28.750
Yeah.

01:05:41.807 --> 01:05:44.418
Hey, do me a favor,

01:06:12.403 --> 01:06:14.144

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:18.583
All right!
Don't move!

01:06:37.036 --> 01:06:38.472
[winces]

01:06:59.928 --> 01:07:01.234
Whoa...

01:07:01.278 --> 01:07:03.410
I'm sorry to scare you,señorita.

01:07:03.454 --> 01:07:04.455
What the fuck?

01:07:09.590 --> 01:07:11.375
I told you,
we were having a party.

01:07:21.124 --> 01:07:23.387
[panting]

01:07:25.563 --> 01:07:28.131
Get down on the ground,

01:07:28.174 --> 01:07:29.871
[gun clicks]

01:07:29.915 --> 01:07:31.351
[groans]

01:07:32.787 --> 01:07:34.485
Shit!

01:07:34.528 --> 01:07:35.486
[sheriff]
I will blow your head off!

01:07:35.529 --> 01:07:36.661
Do it, now!

01:07:36.704 --> 01:07:38.532
Sheriff!

01:07:38.576 --> 01:07:40.273
[yelling]

01:07:44.582 --> 01:07:46.932
Fuckin' stupid...[mutters]

01:07:49.804 --> 01:07:51.676
Sorry to scare you, señorita.

01:08:23.011 --> 01:08:24.970
My condolences.

01:08:25.013 --> 01:08:26.841
Condolences for what?

01:08:29.322 --> 01:08:31.629
You think that shot
was for my man?

01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:35.894
Rob's from a family of Marines.

01:08:35.937 --> 01:08:40.028
Where did your big black sex toylearn how to handle a gun?

01:08:40.072 --> 01:08:43.031
He's a thief, not a killer.

01:08:43.075 --> 01:08:45.251
You know fuck all about it.

01:08:45.295 --> 01:08:47.210
That's why you're justa wee farm whore.

01:08:47.252 --> 01:08:49.341
My man's not dead.

01:08:51.997 --> 01:08:54.042
[speaking Spanish]

01:08:54.086 --> 01:08:55.827
Swift!

01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:57.176
[speaking Spanish]

01:08:57.220 --> 01:08:58.656
Say he's dead again.

01:08:59.961 --> 01:09:02.006
I don't think he's dead,but he's gone.

01:09:02.050 --> 01:09:03.487
Surprise.

01:09:03.529 --> 01:09:04.923
Gone how?

01:09:04.966 --> 01:09:06.533
He's been scheming on you

01:09:06.577 --> 01:09:07.839
ever since you wentto get the truck.

01:09:07.881 --> 01:09:09.884
Asked if I couldjust punt the weed.

01:09:09.928 --> 01:09:12.626
[scoffs] I wouldn't trust you
to walk my dog.

01:09:12.670 --> 01:09:17.283
It's true, even if it's coming
from this piece of shit.

01:09:17.327 --> 01:09:20.678
I could tell he wanted to leave
ever since you killed that kid.

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:25.073
[whispering]
He wouldn't get very far.
I have the keys.

01:09:25.117 --> 01:09:27.118
He could have wired
the truck though.

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:28.947
Took the other guy's car.

01:09:34.692 --> 01:09:36.868
Take the cuffs.

01:09:36.911 --> 01:09:40.350
And, Adder... leave the pistol.

01:10:02.807 --> 01:10:04.896
Aye.
Come here, you.

01:10:04.939 --> 01:10:07.203
[grunting]

01:10:20.825 --> 01:10:22.218
And why'd you stick around?

01:10:24.785 --> 01:10:29.181
I told you...I'm going to pay off my debt.

01:10:29.877 --> 01:10:31.270
And why?

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:36.101
I didn't want to run from you.

01:10:38.973 --> 01:10:40.061
Smart.

01:10:45.589 --> 01:10:47.025
[laughing]

01:10:52.335 --> 01:10:53.510
Sorry.

01:10:54.641 --> 01:10:55.642
Keys.

01:10:56.687 --> 01:10:58.036
Give me the keys.

01:10:58.079 --> 01:10:59.646
Give me the fucking keys!

01:10:59.690 --> 01:11:01.213
Give me the keys.

01:11:10.570 --> 01:11:11.745
Swift!

01:11:12.659 --> 01:11:15.488
Swift!

01:11:15.532 --> 01:11:17.403
Ah, I hope you
enjoyed the fucking show!

01:11:23.104 --> 01:11:24.236
Fuck you!

01:11:25.455 --> 01:11:28.153
Baby, baby, I'm sorry.

01:11:28.196 --> 01:11:30.416
How could you bring
someone like that here, huh?

01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:32.288
[Ticker]
You out here?!

01:11:33.463 --> 01:11:35.421
I know you out here!

01:11:35.465 --> 01:11:37.075
Right boy?!

01:11:37.118 --> 01:11:38.990
Do you have a hair pin?

01:11:39.033 --> 01:11:41.384
- Maria!
- In the... dresser.

01:11:43.908 --> 01:11:46.911
Or are you just another runner?!

01:11:48.216 --> 01:11:49.783
[Adder] I didn't have a choice.

01:11:49.827 --> 01:11:51.350
Of course you had a choice!
You chose!

01:11:51.394 --> 01:11:53.700
They weren't taking "no"
for an answer.

01:11:53.744 --> 01:11:56.050
- Hurry the fuck up!
- I'm trying!

01:11:58.749 --> 01:12:02.318
I admit, things got a littledicey back there, fucked.

01:12:02.361 --> 01:12:04.885
But if we hustle outta here now,

01:12:04.929 --> 01:12:07.627
we still got a chancefor our happy ending.

01:12:07.671 --> 01:12:10.021

01:12:11.457 --> 01:12:13.851
I don't speak fucking Spanish!

01:12:13.894 --> 01:12:17.245
Did you even hesitateto put my life in danger?

01:12:17.289 --> 01:12:21.293
- Baby, baby...
- Stop fucking
calling me "baby."

01:12:32.391 --> 01:12:33.436
Shit!

01:12:38.702 --> 01:12:42.793
My cousin is dead...because of you!

01:12:48.364 --> 01:12:50.366
Wait, wait, is this about...

01:12:52.759 --> 01:12:54.979
Are you knocked up for real?

01:12:57.155 --> 01:12:58.809
Fuck you.

01:13:17.001 --> 01:13:19.264
You were supposed to
wear protection.

01:13:20.831 --> 01:13:21.919
You know what...?

01:13:34.497 --> 01:13:36.281
Let's just go.
We'll get it taken care of, OK?

01:13:36.324 --> 01:13:38.283
Just go!

01:14:16.539 --> 01:14:20.499
Tell me you feel good...

01:15:22.866 --> 01:15:25.999
You better fucking run!

01:15:26.043 --> 01:15:28.045
[Maria] So, what,

and then go drive
a thousand miles to sell it?!

01:15:29.916 --> 01:15:31.918
- That's your plan?
- Have you got a better one?

01:15:31.962 --> 01:15:33.790
That's what
we were gonna do anyway!

01:15:33.833 --> 01:15:36.314

Not fuck the shit up

And you fucked it up!

01:15:39.317 --> 01:15:42.929
I wasn't fucking expectingsome clock-faced psychopath

01:15:42.973 --> 01:15:44.670
to come through the doorand demand things!

01:15:44.714 --> 01:15:46.585
If it wasn't for your dumbass,

01:15:46.629 --> 01:15:48.413

What will we do?
What will become of us?

01:17:14.499 --> 01:17:16.109

01:17:18.546 --> 01:17:21.114
[wheezes]

01:17:21.158 --> 01:17:23.943

01:17:23.987 --> 01:17:26.337
everybody'd still be alive!

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:33.779

01:18:52.466 --> 01:18:54.381
I just got here
and found Maria all tied up.

01:18:58.559 --> 01:18:59.952

01:19:09.266 --> 01:19:10.963
Maria, what the fuck!You know that's not true!

01:19:11.007 --> 01:19:12.269
Let's not start blaming each...

01:19:25.586 --> 01:19:28.328
[grunting]

01:19:32.245 --> 01:19:33.856
[radio chatter indistinct]

01:19:33.899 --> 01:19:34.900
[Maria]
Where is it?

01:19:49.872 --> 01:19:51.438
Where the fuck is it?

01:20:02.362 --> 01:20:04.582
You fuck!
You fuck!

01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:12.808
You like fucking my girl?!

01:20:12.851 --> 01:20:15.941
She's a good fucking actress,
isn't she?

01:20:19.292 --> 01:20:20.772
You think that she fucking likesyou?!

01:20:24.471 --> 01:20:26.691
- [gunshot]
- [groans]

01:20:26.734 --> 01:20:30.521
[coughing]

01:20:46.798 --> 01:20:53.587
I swear,I prayed for protection,from everything, from this.

01:20:53.631 --> 01:20:56.503
- What, leaving me for dead?
- No, that's not true!

01:20:56.547 --> 01:20:59.071
I didn't know!He was making me leave.

01:20:59.115 --> 01:21:01.508
Then why you still
pointing a gun at me, Maria?

01:21:01.552 --> 01:21:04.685
Why are you asking me that,instead of asking if we're okay?

01:21:04.729 --> 01:21:08.298
We?
Is it even really mine?

01:21:10.213 --> 01:21:14.739
I don't know...but... but I want her to be.

01:21:16.610 --> 01:21:20.440
I chose you. I choose you.

01:21:22.007 --> 01:21:26.533
But if that's not enough,I can raise her on my own.

01:21:26.577 --> 01:21:28.231
[laughing]

01:21:28.274 --> 01:21:30.624
I got nothing left to give,
Maria!

01:21:30.668 --> 01:21:32.148
Why don't you go get
your money bag

01:21:32.191 --> 01:21:34.063
from your other friend
in the cave?

01:21:34.106 --> 01:21:36.935
Please, don't make me do this.

01:21:36.979 --> 01:21:39.068
[laughing]

01:21:39.111 --> 01:21:40.896
What... what else do you
want me to give?

01:21:40.939 --> 01:21:42.723
What do you want from me?!

01:21:42.767 --> 01:21:45.161
What do you want me to do?!
What do you expect?!

01:21:45.204 --> 01:21:48.207
How do you expect me
to make this work, huh?

01:21:48.251 --> 01:21:50.601
After this?

01:21:50.644 --> 01:21:52.777
Because you believein serendipity.

01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:54.431
[panting]

01:22:08.532 --> 01:22:11.274
Hey, no! No! No!

01:22:11.317 --> 01:22:12.753
[groans]

01:22:13.667 --> 01:22:15.800
[panting]

01:22:19.673 --> 01:22:21.023
Baby!

01:22:22.154 --> 01:22:23.982
[crying]

01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:29.509
[whimpering]

01:22:45.177 --> 01:22:48.615
[narrator] The mythology for
these enemies is well-known.

01:22:48.659 --> 01:22:52.750
And although hyenas
have a reputation as thieves,

01:22:52.793 --> 01:22:55.622
they are more than
capable predators.

01:22:55.666 --> 01:22:58.277
The matriarch
both dominates her pack,

01:22:58.321 --> 01:23:03.891
and fiercely defends it from
the lions who stalk her cubs;

01:23:03.935 --> 01:23:07.765
for the lion and hyena
are sympatric.

01:23:07.808 --> 01:23:10.550
And although they fight
for resources and respect,

01:23:10.594 --> 01:23:13.640
their behaviors
are quite different.

01:23:13.684 --> 01:23:18.123
In the pride,
the alpha protects
his territory from rogues,

01:23:18.167 --> 01:23:20.734
while the lionesses hunt.

01:23:20.778 --> 01:23:25.739
But a hyena cannot rely on companionship from her pack.

01:23:25.783 --> 01:23:28.046
The social system
of the spotted hyena

01:23:28.090 --> 01:23:32.050
is openly competitive
rather than cooperative.

01:23:32.094 --> 01:23:35.662
And this particular creature
must embrace her independence

01:23:35.706 --> 01:23:38.491
and learn to hunt alone.

01:23:38.535 --> 01:23:43.496
For she must remain,
above all, a survivor.
