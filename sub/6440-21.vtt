00:28.962 --> 00:31.362
It's a beautiful day, isn't it?

00:31.531 --> 00:33.624
So far, but they're calling
for storms later.

00:33.800 --> 00:36.701
Well, you know the heartland,
some things can change in a minute.

00:36.870 --> 00:39.839
- Is everyone assembled?
- Twenty-four hours isn't a lot of notice.

00:40.006 --> 00:42.804
Will you give me a heads-up
as to the nature of your remarks?

00:42.976 --> 00:46.434
Just one of my customary motivational
speeches you've heard hundreds of times.

00:46.613 --> 00:48.706
- How are you? Good to see you.
- How you doing?

00:48.882 --> 00:51.817
- Good morning. Good to see you.
- Good morning.

00:51.985 --> 00:54.078
- Good morning. Good to see you.
- Thank you.

00:54.254 --> 00:55.653
Fire up the troops!

00:55.822 --> 00:59.019
The plant made a profit this quarter
for the first time in two years.

00:59.192 --> 01:02.252
My people are expecting a pat on the back,
and they deserve to get it.

01:02.429 --> 01:05.022
I'll try not to disappoint them.

01:10.170 --> 01:11.660
Thank you.

01:11.838 --> 01:13.328
Thank you.

01:13.506 --> 01:16.532
As most of you know...

01:16.743 --> 01:20.509
...you've all worked extremely hard
this past year...

01:20.680 --> 01:23.979
...and you should all be proud
of yourselves.

01:30.590 --> 01:34.583
Just as a ship can only follow
the course...

01:34.761 --> 01:36.922
...set by its captain...

01:37.097 --> 01:41.397
...any business is only
as good as its leadership.

01:42.602 --> 01:46.060
Due to management failures
beyond your control...

01:46.639 --> 01:48.766
...this plant will be closing...

01:49.742 --> 01:51.869
...effective immediately.

01:52.612 --> 01:55.046
Good luck to all of you.

01:59.285 --> 02:01.719
You just fired 2500 people
and blamed it on me.

02:01.888 --> 02:04.550
One day you'll thank me.
Smallville isn't in your future.

02:04.724 --> 02:07.522
- It's just a brief chapter in your biography.
- Don't do this.

02:07.694 --> 02:11.130
We live in a meritocracy, Lex.
The weak get left behind.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.322
The plant wasn't producing.
I had no other options.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.491
Spare me the corporate barbarian spiel.

02:15.668 --> 02:18.364
Those people have husbands and wives,
children, mortgages.

02:18.538 --> 02:20.768
We're in business to make profits,
not friends!

02:20.940 --> 02:23.636
Don't let your emotions get in the way
of making tough decisions!

02:23.810 --> 02:26.404
Don't lecture me about letting
emotions get in the way.

02:26.579 --> 02:28.069
This plant was showing a profit.

02:28.248 --> 02:31.615
You're shutting it down because
I wouldn't go work for you in Metropolis.

02:31.784 --> 02:36.244
Lex, you may have felt that you found
a home here, but you were mistaken.

02:36.422 --> 02:40.017
This was just your training ground.
Well, your training is over!

02:44.497 --> 02:46.931
You're coming home, son!

03:55.735 --> 03:58.568
Pete, I need your opinion.
Classic black or traditional red?

03:58.738 --> 03:59.830
For what?

04:00.006 --> 04:02.702
My tie-cummerbund combo.
I gotta get my tux order in today.

04:02.875 --> 04:05.275
If I were you, I'd stick
with the traditional black.

04:05.445 --> 04:07.777
- This is no time to get adventurous.
- You're right.

04:07.947 --> 04:11.007
I don't know, Clark.
Red always looks good on you.

04:11.184 --> 04:12.173
Then red it is.

04:12.352 --> 04:15.082
Thanks. Now I gotta go make a call
and change my order.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.519
I don't want people mistaking us for twins.

04:17.690 --> 04:20.420
Yeah, because that happens all the time.

04:21.027 --> 04:22.892
You seem really excited about the dance.

04:23.062 --> 04:27.021
I am, but between the tickets, the tux
and buying the flowers, it gets expensive.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.929
You should try finding the right dress.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.433
Guess the limo's out.

04:30.603 --> 04:33.265
I'm actually thinking of asking Lex
if I can borrow his.

04:33.439 --> 04:36.374
Chloe says she doesn't care,
but deep down I know she wants one.

04:36.542 --> 04:38.533
I'm trying to surprise her,
so keep it between us.

04:38.711 --> 04:40.702
My lips are sealed.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.381
Chloe?

04:43.549 --> 04:46.074
They're closing the LuthorCorp plant.

04:55.728 --> 04:58.720
<i>- So you heard.
- The Ledger rushed a special edition.</i>

04:58.898 --> 05:01.890
They haven't done that
since the meteor shower.

05:02.068 --> 05:04.127
I talked to Chloe. She's pretty upset.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.135
I spoke to her father. He's in shock.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.570
I don't blame him.

05:08.908 --> 05:12.537
- How's this gonna affect us?
- That plant was Smallville's biggest employer.

05:12.712 --> 05:14.703
Shutting it down
is gonna have a domino effect.

05:14.881 --> 05:18.078
I can't believe Lex would run it
into the ground in less than a year.

05:18.251 --> 05:20.742
Why are you blaming Lex?
His dad closed the plant.

05:20.920 --> 05:25.084
Whatever issues Lionel Luthor has with his
son have now cost half the town their jobs.

05:25.258 --> 05:28.921
You should be happy, then. It means Lex is
going back to Metropolis and out of our lives.

05:29.095 --> 05:31.655
The plant closing is gonna hurt
a lot of people, Clark.

05:31.831 --> 05:36.495
As much as I would like Lex out of our
lives, I wouldn't wish that on anybody.

05:36.769 --> 05:42.435
I know, Dad. It's just...
Lex cares about the town.

05:42.608 --> 05:44.269
He said he had big plans.

05:44.444 --> 05:47.607
The road to hell is paved
with good intentions.

05:56.122 --> 06:00.183
Okay. Turn. We're almost there.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.952
All right.

06:02.128 --> 06:04.289
- Okay.
- Stop.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.192
Open your eyes.

06:09.135 --> 06:10.568
Wow!

06:11.204 --> 06:12.831
Why are you being so mysterious?

06:13.005 --> 06:16.702
- Can't a guy plan a picnic for his girlfriend?
- I'm not complaining.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.969
It's just kind of spontaneous.

06:19.145 --> 06:21.113
Are you saying I'm usually boring?

06:21.280 --> 06:25.876
I'm saying this is very nice.
I'm just wondering what the occasion is.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.646
It's to thank you for everything.

06:28.821 --> 06:31.722
It's been a difficult year,
and you've stood by me.

06:31.891 --> 06:35.793
I pushed you away, and you could
have made other choices. You didn't.

06:35.962 --> 06:41.559
We've been together a long time.
I'd never abandon you when you needed me.

06:42.335 --> 06:44.064
There's something I want to tell you.

06:49.342 --> 06:53.506
Whitney, you know, maybe we should-

06:56.015 --> 06:58.040
- What's this?
- Read it.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.554
United States Marine Corps?

07:06.926 --> 07:08.689
I enlisted.

07:11.697 --> 07:14.063
I think it's the right thing for me to do.

07:14.233 --> 07:17.930
When I found my dad's medals, I felt
he was telling me which path I should take.

07:18.271 --> 07:22.731
- You can't do this for your father.
- I'm not. I'm doing it for us.

07:24.043 --> 07:26.568
Please, don't be mad.

07:28.481 --> 07:31.279
It's just so fast, you know?

07:31.451 --> 07:34.545
I need some time to process it.

07:35.655 --> 07:38.556
I don't have a lot of time.

07:40.526 --> 07:43.791
I ship out for basic training Saturday night.

07:45.865 --> 07:48.629
What about graduation?

07:48.901 --> 07:51.768
The only thing I'm gonna miss
in Smallville is you.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.665
Will you wait for me?

08:10.089 --> 08:15.755
Clark, I got your messages,
but I've been having a bad day.

08:16.028 --> 08:17.996
Nice paperweight.

08:18.297 --> 08:21.164
Yeah, very unique.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.666
Sure you can afford being seen
with the town pariah?

08:23.836 --> 08:26.430
I'll take my chances.

08:28.541 --> 08:30.133
What happened, Lex?

08:30.309 --> 08:32.106
The two theories seem to be...

08:32.278 --> 08:34.940
...I either ran the plant into the ground
through incompetence...

08:35.114 --> 08:37.344
...or did it deliberately to go back
to Metropolis.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.679
Your dad already offered you a job
in Metropolis. Just tell people the truth.

08:40.852 --> 08:43.116
Then I get stuck
with the incompetence rap.

08:43.289 --> 08:44.950
Being reviled is the lesser evil.

08:46.125 --> 08:48.184
I guess you're going back
to Metropolis, then.

08:48.361 --> 08:52.457
That's why my father orchestrated
his coup, but this isn't over.

08:52.632 --> 08:55.465
- You have a plan?
- Maybe.

09:00.172 --> 09:02.697
You have a lot of work to do.

09:03.309 --> 09:07.006
Clark, thanks for stopping by.
It means a lot.

09:07.179 --> 09:08.703
What are friends for?

09:23.095 --> 09:25.063
Thought I'd find you here.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.997
My dad and I can't really do
the whole depressed thing together, so...

09:29.168 --> 09:31.830
If you're not up for Saturday night,
I'd understand.

09:32.004 --> 09:35.906
You kidding me? It's the only thing
I have to look forward to right now.

09:36.075 --> 09:40.739
Besides, I want to enjoy all the quaint
Smallville High customs while I still can.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.608
Why? Where are you going?

09:42.782 --> 09:46.115
My dad's talking about moving
us back to Metropolis permanently.

09:46.619 --> 09:48.587
<i>What about the Torch and all your friends?</i>

09:48.921 --> 09:51.253
I can't even think about it right now.

09:52.558 --> 09:55.254
Clark, I'm not exactly psyched
about having to fight my way...

09:55.428 --> 09:58.795
...through the high school hierarchy
all over again.

10:00.032 --> 10:01.693
You're gonna miss me, right?

10:02.768 --> 10:05.236
Do you even have to ask?

10:05.404 --> 10:08.373
Just promise me Saturday night's
gonna be great.

10:08.541 --> 10:10.941
It'll be a night you won't forget.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.050
I appreciate you coming.

10:19.619 --> 10:23.055
My father doesn't know about this meeting,
and I'd like to keep it that way.

10:23.222 --> 10:25.850
When I first came here...

10:26.025 --> 10:29.153
...people assumed I was just another
glaring example of nepotism...

10:29.395 --> 10:32.558
...unskilled and promoted over the heads
of the more competent and deserving.

10:32.732 --> 10:35.394
But I'd like to think the people
in this room feel differently.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.968
If we can raise the capital
for an employee-led buyout...

10:38.971 --> 10:41.735
- ... we can keep the plant running.
- Buyout?

10:41.907 --> 10:43.807
I can raise nearly 90%% of the capital.

10:44.343 --> 10:46.937
What about the rest?
We're supposed to mortgage our houses?

10:47.113 --> 10:48.808
It's a risk, I know.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.506
But in exchange, the investors
will become minority owners.

10:51.684 --> 10:55.313
Doesn't your father control the board?
Why would he go along with a buyout?

10:55.488 --> 10:59.754
I know a couple of members I can convince,
and I don't need a unanimous decision.

10:59.925 --> 11:03.588
I'm offering you the chance
to take control of your own destiny.

11:03.763 --> 11:06.596
Stand with me, and we'll win.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.709
Clark.

11:26.952 --> 11:29.785
Out wandering the streets of Smallville?

11:31.624 --> 11:33.615
What is it?

11:34.126 --> 11:38.290
I just found out that Chloe
might be leaving for good.

11:38.964 --> 11:41.797
Not sure I really believe it's true.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.693
I know what you mean.

11:45.471 --> 11:47.371
You do?

11:49.408 --> 11:51.638
Whitney's going off to join the Marines.

11:53.813 --> 11:55.678
That's intense.

11:55.848 --> 11:58.874
He told me he was doing it for us.

11:59.385 --> 12:00.875
Asked if I'd wait for him.

12:02.888 --> 12:05.015
Really? What did you say?

12:09.061 --> 12:10.858
Nothing.

12:11.030 --> 12:14.989
I kind of just stood there
in stunned silence.

12:15.201 --> 12:17.328
One day he's worried
about his English paper...

12:17.536 --> 12:21.666
...and the next, he's putting on
a uniform and saving the world.

12:22.508 --> 12:24.999
So you didn't commit?

12:26.245 --> 12:28.042
I told him I wasn't sure.

12:30.449 --> 12:32.679
When does he head out?

12:34.320 --> 12:36.584
Saturday night.

12:40.693 --> 12:43.526
Guess you don't have to worry
about your dress.

12:46.599 --> 12:50.535
I can't believe both Whitney and Chloe
are gonna be out of our lives.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.704
Me neither.

12:54.406 --> 12:57.273
Guess we get left behind, Clark.

14:20.559 --> 14:22.527
What do you think caused the explosion?

14:22.695 --> 14:24.686
Son, my guess is it was a leaky fuel line.

14:24.864 --> 14:28.664
The fumes must have ignited the fertilizer
in the truck. I should have checked it better.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.769
- I'm glad it was me and not one of you guys.
- Oh, sweetheart.

14:31.937 --> 14:34.269
The truth is,
I barely felt the heat this time.

14:34.640 --> 14:37.268
And the debris didn't leave any bruises.

14:39.478 --> 14:43.312
As you get older,
your body must be getting stronger.

15:00.566 --> 15:03.967
You're not in a hurry to pack?

15:04.136 --> 15:06.161
That's because I'm not leaving.

15:06.338 --> 15:10.968
Accept your fate, Lex.
It's time to move on.

15:11.143 --> 15:15.876
I'm forcing a vote of the board of directors
to accept an employee buyout of the plant.

15:16.382 --> 15:20.318
What are you gonna do? Convince the
employees to take out a second mortgage?

15:20.886 --> 15:24.083
- Cash in their IRAs.
- Something like that.

15:24.256 --> 15:27.885
Even if you sell all your stock
and drain your trust fund...

15:28.327 --> 15:30.124
...you still come up short, Lex.

15:30.496 --> 15:32.521
What will you do about
the rest of the money?

15:32.698 --> 15:35.394
Take the buyout now,
and you can keep your dignity.

15:35.567 --> 15:39.594
- That's more than you left me.
- That's very gracious of you, son.

15:39.772 --> 15:44.038
You might wanna look at this first.

15:51.216 --> 15:53.411
You've bought
the Smallville Savings and Loan.

15:53.585 --> 15:57.681
Go ahead, lead your buyout. But remember,
I own your employees' mortgages.

15:57.856 --> 16:00.120
As soon as they begin missing payments...

16:00.292 --> 16:03.420
...I won't hesitate to foreclose
on each and every one of them.

16:03.595 --> 16:07.463
They'll be homeless,
and it will be your fault.

16:07.800 --> 16:11.566
You ready to accept
that kind of responsibility?

16:11.737 --> 16:13.728
If you're going to take me on, son...

16:13.906 --> 16:18.468
...you're gonna have to bring your game up
to a whole different level.

16:19.578 --> 16:21.910
- Where have you been?
- I went to pick up my dress.

16:22.081 --> 16:23.605
- We have a problem.
- You can't go.

16:23.782 --> 16:27.274
I just can't pick you up. My transportation
kind of went up in flames.

16:27.453 --> 16:30.581
I was gonna ask Lex if I could borrow
his limo, but with the plant-

16:30.756 --> 16:34.317
- Clark, I'll drive.
- Ruins the whole Prince Charming vibe.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.256
Cinderella was never my role model.

16:36.428 --> 16:40.421
- Why the Marines?
- I don't know. It's just something I gotta do.

16:40.766 --> 16:44.429
- So Whitney's off to fight evil for Uncle Sam.
- I heard.

16:44.603 --> 16:47.538
That technically makes Lana a free agent.

16:47.706 --> 16:49.936
He asked her to wait for him.

16:50.409 --> 16:52.240
Long-distance relationships never work.

16:52.411 --> 16:56.871
People change, have different experiences.
It's kind of like us, you know?

16:57.049 --> 16:59.449
After a couple of weeks,
you'll forget all about me.

16:59.918 --> 17:01.044
Chloe!

17:03.188 --> 17:05.849
Okay, I just have this horrible nightmare...

17:06.025 --> 17:08.618
...that you'll rush to the bus station
after Whitney leaves...

17:08.794 --> 17:12.286
...and profess your undying love for Lana,
and I'll be waiting at the gym alone.

17:12.464 --> 17:15.194
If you do that to me, Clark,
I'll never speak to you again.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.267
Okay, I said it.

17:18.404 --> 17:20.031
Chloe.

17:27.813 --> 17:32.307
I'm going to the dance with you
not by default, but because I want to.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.785
All right, I feel better now.

17:41.627 --> 17:44.824
If I could just have one minute
of your time, Clark.

17:44.997 --> 17:46.897
- How do you know my name?
- Roger Nixon.

17:47.066 --> 17:51.628
<i>I'm a journalist with the Inquisitor,
and I would like to write a story about you.</i>

17:52.071 --> 17:54.335
Thanks, but I'm really not interested.

17:56.575 --> 17:59.066
Why weren't you hurt in that explosion?

17:59.244 --> 18:01.405
You were in the truck on the farm.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.013
I was nowhere near that truck.

18:03.582 --> 18:05.846
Am I missing something interesting?

18:06.018 --> 18:07.610
Lex?

18:10.122 --> 18:13.148
You know my name,
but I don't know yours.

18:13.392 --> 18:15.656
<i>Roger Nixon. I work for the Inquisitor.</i>

18:15.828 --> 18:20.060
When is someone gonna put that bad
excuse for a tabloid out of its misery?

18:21.533 --> 18:24.229
It was nice meeting you, Lex.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.864
I'm sure we'll talk again soon, Clark.

18:33.545 --> 18:35.536
What was that all about?

18:35.714 --> 18:38.649
He wants to do a story on me,
make me out to be some kind of hero.

18:38.817 --> 18:40.546
<i>The Inquisitor's a rag, Clark.</i>

18:40.719 --> 18:43.449
If I were you,
I wouldn't get mixed up with him.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.920
I don't intend to.

18:47.392 --> 18:51.385
If he gives you any more trouble,
let me know.

19:05.244 --> 19:07.303
Hi, son.

19:09.915 --> 19:12.076
Something wrong?

19:12.317 --> 19:15.844
<i>A journalist from the Inquisitor
wants to do a story on me.</i>

19:16.588 --> 19:18.249
He knows I was in the truck.

19:18.423 --> 19:21.586
I don't think it was an accident.
I think he set it up to test me.

19:21.760 --> 19:23.455
How did he know you would survive?

19:23.629 --> 19:26.655
He must have seen me
do something before.

19:27.299 --> 19:29.995
Look, I swear, ever since Phelan,
I've been so careful.

19:30.169 --> 19:33.263
Clark, it's not your fault.

19:35.240 --> 19:39.939
- But what do I do?
- Carry on, go to school, go to the dance...

19:40.112 --> 19:43.878
...and if this reporter's really got something,
I'm sure he'll come talk to us.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.791
What else?

19:55.127 --> 19:58.290
I think Lex has a piece of the spaceship.

19:59.298 --> 20:01.459
Are you sure?

20:02.534 --> 20:04.627
I saw it on his desk. It's the missing piece.

20:04.803 --> 20:06.464
<i>He must have found it in the field.</i>

20:06.638 --> 20:09.266
<i>I don't know if he suspects anything,
but who knows what he'll do?</i>

20:09.441 --> 20:12.877
- We all know how persistent Lex can be-
- He can't trace it to us.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.980
Your mother's right, son.
We'll just keep our heads low.

20:16.148 --> 20:18.446
So when you do your chores,
don't use your abilities.

20:18.617 --> 20:20.744
<i>Whatever you do,
stay away from that storm cellar.</i>

20:40.172 --> 20:42.402
You wanted to see me, Lex?

20:42.574 --> 20:44.940
I'm surprised
you even remembered my name.

20:45.344 --> 20:47.335
I warned you to stay away from the Kents.

20:47.512 --> 20:49.742
Let me guess.
This is where you remind me...

20:49.915 --> 20:52.577
...of all the terrible things
you can have done to me.

20:52.751 --> 20:56.243
As I'm sure you're well aware,
I'm a little preoccupied at the moment.

20:56.421 --> 20:58.685
I don't have time to deal
with your annoyances.

20:58.857 --> 21:02.850
Well, what I have discovered
is beyond you and your problems...

21:03.028 --> 21:05.360
...and your threats.

21:05.530 --> 21:08.328
This newfound self-assurance
doesn't suit you, Roger.

21:08.500 --> 21:12.163
Be nice, Lex, or I may not let you bid
on my discovery.

21:12.337 --> 21:13.929
And I know you'll want to...

21:14.106 --> 21:18.941
...especially when you consider all your
interest in the crash site and the Kents.

21:19.111 --> 21:22.410
What was found out there has nothing
to do with the Kents or with you.

21:22.581 --> 21:23.809
Are you certain?

21:24.116 --> 21:27.085
Roger, for all your bravado,
you have yet to show me anything.

21:27.252 --> 21:30.881
I'll show you all the evidence
you need tonight.

21:31.056 --> 21:32.614
And you'll see for yourself.

21:32.791 --> 21:37.228
There's a whole lot more to your friend
Clark Kent than meets the eye.

21:40.232 --> 21:44.396
- I swear, if you harass Clark or his parents-
- Who said anything about harassment?

21:44.569 --> 21:48.335
Maybe I'll just tell them the truth,
that you turned me on to them.

21:48.640 --> 21:54.169
And if you're not interested in what I have,
I know of another Luthor who will be.

21:55.147 --> 21:58.412
You are playing a very dangerous game.

21:58.583 --> 22:01.143
You'd better pray you're not wrong.

22:08.593 --> 22:11.255
Mom, can you give me a hand with this?

22:12.864 --> 22:14.661
Who's there?

22:14.833 --> 22:16.767
It's me, Clark. Are you all right?

22:16.935 --> 22:19.768
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Really? You seem a little tense.

22:19.938 --> 22:21.997
It's just the dance and everything.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.766
Come here.

22:23.942 --> 22:27.503
I'm sure I've tied more of these
than your mother.

22:28.380 --> 22:30.280
Thought you were holed up
in the mansion.

22:30.449 --> 22:33.782
Well, I needed to clear my head.
Took a drive, ended up here.

22:33.952 --> 22:36.079
I didn't mean to bother you
on your big day.

22:36.288 --> 22:38.779
I got a little time. Chloe's picking me up.

22:38.957 --> 22:41.949
That's very progressive.
What happened to the truck?

22:42.127 --> 22:45.187
A farming accident. You know how it is.

22:46.298 --> 22:48.198
So how goes the bailout?

22:48.367 --> 22:52.030
I'm not sure, Clark. I think it's
gonna get ugly before it gets better.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.502
My father's dead set
against me succeeding.

22:54.806 --> 22:57.036
Why would your father be
against the plant?

22:57.209 --> 22:59.871
We have a complicated relationship, Clark.

23:00.045 --> 23:03.481
My father wants me to believe
it's built on trust, but it's not.

23:03.648 --> 23:05.548
It's built on lies and deceit.

23:05.717 --> 23:09.153
Any relationship with that foundation
is destined to fail.

23:09.321 --> 23:12.984
- Lucky we don't have that problem.
- Lucky us.

23:13.492 --> 23:16.393
I want you to know whatever happens
in the next few days...

23:16.561 --> 23:19.655
...I'm still your friend,
and that's never gonna change.

23:19.831 --> 23:23.494
- I hope you feel the same way.
- I do.

23:23.668 --> 23:25.727
What do you think's gonna happen?

23:25.904 --> 23:29.840
I don't know. Just got a bad feeling...

23:30.008 --> 23:32.670
...like when you can smell
the air change before a storm.

23:32.844 --> 23:35.074
Storms are a way of life around here, Lex.

23:35.247 --> 23:38.011
The trick is to not get caught
out in the open.

23:38.183 --> 23:40.515
Look after yourself.

23:48.326 --> 23:53.389
It's hard to believe. I thought
my whole life was in that trophy case.

23:53.565 --> 23:56.056
Now it all seems so trivial.

23:57.001 --> 23:59.834
We should get you to the bus station.

24:02.607 --> 24:05.235
My bus doesn't leave for an hour.

24:05.744 --> 24:08.406
How about we go check out the gym?

24:09.180 --> 24:11.580
Okay.

24:24.863 --> 24:27.024
It's beautiful.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.534
Where is everyone?

24:30.702 --> 24:34.365
Hour before the dance, the setup
committee goes home to get ready.

24:56.060 --> 24:59.552
You're missing the spring formal
because of me.

25:00.064 --> 25:03.397
We still have time for one last dance.

25:20.318 --> 25:23.651
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before I enlisted.

25:24.155 --> 25:26.749
I think you're very brave.

25:33.932 --> 25:38.596
I know this is kind of sudden,
and you're not sure how you feel about us-

25:38.770 --> 25:42.831
Whitney, let's just dance.

26:24.983 --> 26:27.042
Hi.

26:28.820 --> 26:30.344
What do you think? Too pink?

26:30.521 --> 26:32.853
No. You-
You look beautiful.

26:33.725 --> 26:36.216
Thank you. You clean up nicely yourself.

26:36.561 --> 26:38.051
What happened to the red tie?

26:38.496 --> 26:40.521
Instinct told me it was
the wrong way to go.

26:41.332 --> 26:44.358
- Is that for me?
- Oh, yeah.

26:44.736 --> 26:47.227
Oh, wow!

26:47.405 --> 26:49.896
It's beautiful.

26:50.074 --> 26:52.736
Oh, I have yours!

26:54.979 --> 26:57.004
Okay.

26:58.583 --> 27:01.575
Oh, did I get you?

27:08.526 --> 27:10.517
We should go.

27:10.695 --> 27:12.663
Yeah. Well, here we go.

27:13.264 --> 27:15.698
- I'll get the door.
- Okay.

27:16.367 --> 27:20.428
- Thanks. Looks like a storm's coming.
- Yeah.

27:20.939 --> 27:23.305
- In?
- In.

27:45.964 --> 27:49.456
- This is crazy!
- I know.

27:49.634 --> 27:51.124
- You okay?
- Let's go.

27:51.302 --> 27:53.566
Let's get inside!

27:57.075 --> 27:58.872
Wow, you guys look great.

27:59.043 --> 28:01.978
Well, thank you, Ms. Rivers.
It's faux Wang.

28:02.146 --> 28:03.636
- Hi.
- Hi, Erica.

28:03.815 --> 28:06.079
Hey, Chloe, could you-?

28:06.250 --> 28:09.083
- He wants you to take our picture.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

28:09.253 --> 28:13.587
I'll just be a sec. I think he wants proof
that this night actually happened.

28:15.927 --> 28:19.328
- Well, I guess this is it.
- Good luck, Whitney.

28:20.832 --> 28:23.027
Lana, can I have a minute alone
with Clark?

28:23.201 --> 28:26.329
Sure. I'll bring the truck around.

28:27.171 --> 28:28.900
Thanks.

28:34.178 --> 28:36.772
You and I have had a weird year.

28:37.281 --> 28:41.115
I started out thinking
you just wanted to steal Lana.

28:43.021 --> 28:47.287
I'm not trying to make excuses,
but I did some things I'm not proud of.

28:47.458 --> 28:49.756
I'm sorry, Clark.

28:50.361 --> 28:52.454
I appreciate that.

28:55.133 --> 28:59.467
Listen, Clark, there's something
I wanna ask you, a favor.

29:00.304 --> 29:02.204
Okay.

29:02.373 --> 29:06.639
Lana's not sure how she feels
about our relationship right now.

29:07.378 --> 29:09.642
But I am.

29:11.816 --> 29:14.341
I need you to look after her
until I get back.

29:17.555 --> 29:19.182
I really don't know what to say.

29:19.357 --> 29:20.619
Say yes.

29:22.393 --> 29:23.519
Okay.

29:23.728 --> 29:25.719
Clark?

29:30.001 --> 29:31.992
I promise.

29:37.575 --> 29:39.406
Thanks.

29:40.078 --> 29:42.012
Good luck.

30:01.832 --> 30:03.322
What was that all about?

30:03.501 --> 30:06.993
Just guy stuff. Have I told you how
beautiful you look tonight?

30:07.171 --> 30:11.335
Yeah, but frequent reminders
are always appreciated.

30:26.023 --> 30:28.253
Do you have everything?

30:28.526 --> 30:32.053
- You're only allowed one bag.
- I'd never make it as a Marine.

30:38.769 --> 30:41.897
I want you to have this for luck.

30:50.881 --> 30:52.610
I won't lose it this time.

31:04.628 --> 31:06.789
Goodbye, Lana.

31:45.169 --> 31:48.434
I loved you the first moment
that I saw you.

31:48.806 --> 31:52.105
I'll still love you when I see you again.

33:04.014 --> 33:05.743
Oh, Roger.

33:06.584 --> 33:08.347
Baby...

33:08.519 --> 33:12.922
...you are going to be filthy rich!

33:35.946 --> 33:38.210
- Hey.
- Hey, Chloe's having a great time.

33:38.449 --> 33:42.215
- I promised her a night she'd never forget.
- I'm glad you finally stepped up.

33:42.386 --> 33:45.219
Yeah, me too.

33:45.623 --> 33:50.822
- Hey, I like these guys.
- Yeah. Remy Zero!

34:11.415 --> 34:13.382
I love this song.

34:17.621 --> 34:21.989
- This is one of Chloe's favorite songs.
- Why do you think I requested it?

34:22.493 --> 34:24.188
Now, that's what I'm talking about!

34:28.264 --> 34:31.598
- May I have this dance?
- Of course.

36:13.270 --> 36:16.364
The animals are all put away!
There's nothing more we can do here!

36:16.540 --> 36:19.941
- We gotta get to the storm cellar!
- What about Clark?

36:20.110 --> 36:24.570
The school's on the other side of town!
He'll be fine!

36:52.676 --> 36:54.166
Mr. Kent!

36:54.344 --> 36:56.835
<i>- Who the hell are you?
- Roger Nixon, Metropolis In-</i>

36:57.014 --> 36:59.107
You're the reporter who threatened Clark!

36:59.282 --> 37:01.842
- Don't do anything!
- Why not? He tried to kill our son.

37:02.019 --> 37:04.817
- Did you blow up that truck?
- I knew it wouldn't hurt him.

37:04.988 --> 37:06.114
No, please!

37:06.289 --> 37:08.348
- Who sent you? Lex Luthor?!
- Jonathan, please!

37:08.525 --> 37:10.993
- Was it Lex Luthor?!
- I don't need Lex Luthor.

37:11.161 --> 37:15.222
- I'll tell the entire world about your son!
- You will not!

37:16.600 --> 37:19.034
No! Jon-

37:19.202 --> 37:20.692
Get up, come on!

37:20.871 --> 37:23.237
Jonathan, look!

37:35.052 --> 37:36.542
Jonathan, the tornado!

37:36.720 --> 37:38.483
But he knows everything!

37:38.655 --> 37:42.386
- I will not let him destroy this family!
- No! Please!

37:43.160 --> 37:45.287
Jonathan!

38:29.706 --> 38:33.665
Clark Kent, man of mystery. Just when I
think I have you figured out, you surprise me.

38:33.944 --> 38:38.972
- How's that?
- The song, the tux...

38:39.149 --> 38:41.208
...tonight.

38:41.384 --> 38:46.219
- And I'm still here.
- Yeah, you are.

39:06.443 --> 39:08.638
Stop the music, please.
Excuse me for a second.

39:09.079 --> 39:11.479
Can I have everyone's attention, please?
Thank you.

39:11.648 --> 39:14.583
The National Weather Service
has just issued a tornado warning.

39:14.751 --> 39:17.311
Three funnels were spotted
heading towards Smallville.

39:17.654 --> 39:19.884
Now, please, everyone, stay calm.

39:20.056 --> 39:23.583
The twisters are gonna set down
south of here, but for your own safety...

39:23.760 --> 39:25.751
...no one will be allowed
to leave the gym.

39:25.929 --> 39:28.363
The bus station's south of town.
Lana's there.

39:28.532 --> 39:30.397
Don't worry. I'm sure she's home by now.

39:30.567 --> 39:34.094
You know what? I'll go call her
on my cell, and you wait here.

39:38.675 --> 39:40.438
Clark?

39:42.846 --> 39:44.837
Clark?

39:54.858 --> 39:56.416
Damn you, Nixon!

39:57.694 --> 40:01.027
So you're using your mother's stock
to fund the buyout.

40:01.198 --> 40:02.631
That's your secret source.

40:02.799 --> 40:06.394
I must admit, it's a bold move, Lex,
but it won't work.

40:06.570 --> 40:09.539
- You braved the weather to tell me that?
- It's suicide, Lex.

40:09.706 --> 40:13.540
You may get the plant, but you're putting
your employees' homes on the line.

40:13.710 --> 40:15.200
Forfeiting your own future.

40:15.879 --> 40:18.439
Or forging a new destiny free from you.

40:20.217 --> 40:23.015
You're not my enemy. You're my son.

40:24.054 --> 40:26.488
I never saw the distinction.

40:26.656 --> 40:29.284
When Alexander the Great was dying,
his generals asked...

40:29.459 --> 40:31.484
...who he would leave his empire to...

40:31.661 --> 40:36.724
...if he would appoint a successor
who would keep the legacy intact...

40:36.900 --> 40:39.562
...prevent generations of bloodshed.

40:39.736 --> 40:42.136
His answer was simple:
"I leave it to the strongest. "

40:42.305 --> 40:45.570
I believe the term is,
"Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war. "

40:45.742 --> 40:49.178
I'll bury you and everyone in Smallville
who takes your side.

41:06.696 --> 41:08.755
No!

41:17.173 --> 41:18.162
Lex!

41:20.210 --> 41:22.075
Lex!

41:22.946 --> 41:24.072
Lex!

41:25.949 --> 41:27.940
Help me, Lex!

41:28.118 --> 41:29.176
Lex!

41:29.953 --> 41:31.887
Can't move!

41:35.892 --> 41:37.689
Help me!

41:42.565 --> 41:43.896
Lex!

41:45.835 --> 41:49.100
Son, please!

42:11.661 --> 42:13.390
Damn it!

42:31.181 --> 42:32.341
Clark!

42:32.515 --> 42:33.607
Lana!

42:33.850 --> 42:35.647
Clark!

42:39.989 --> 42:41.718
No!

42:42.305 --> 42:48.319
