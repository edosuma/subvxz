WEBVTT

00:05.640 --> 00:07.720
Let the fun commence.

00:08.720 --> 00:10.320
(cheering)

00:10.400 --> 00:11.960
'Ex on the Beach is back.'

00:14.960 --> 00:19.240
'Eight new unsuspecting singles
are looking for love.'

00:19.320 --> 00:22.600
'But what they don't know is...'
Fuck.

00:22.680 --> 00:26.200
'...there are more exes
than ever before.'

00:26.280 --> 00:28.960
My arse just fell out me shorts.
You cheated on me!

00:29.040 --> 00:31.000
Stop acting the fucking big man!

00:31.080 --> 00:33.960
You are my best friend
and I wouldn't do that to you!

00:34.040 --> 00:37.880
'And they're flying in
from everywhere.'

00:37.960 --> 00:40.560
(shouting, laughter)

00:42.440 --> 00:44.440
'Some exes want romance.'

00:45.360 --> 00:46.960
I do really, really love him.

00:48.280 --> 00:49.600
'Some want revenge.'

00:49.680 --> 00:52.040
(screaming)
Both of you, let go now!

00:52.120 --> 00:53.440
Let go now!

00:53.520 --> 00:55.640
No-one fucking likes you!
See ya later.

00:55.720 --> 00:58.800
'And others just want to
wreck the gaff.'

01:00.040 --> 01:01.640
Hey!
(clattering)

01:01.720 --> 01:04.879
Fuck! That'll be someone's
fucking head in a minute.

01:04.959 --> 01:08.400
'As always, the Tablet of Terror
is topping up the torment...'

01:08.480 --> 01:11.680
It's gonna be fucking fireworks.
'...causing misery...'

01:11.760 --> 01:13.120
(sobs)
What am I gonna do?

01:13.200 --> 01:15.280
You will never ever have me
ever again.

01:15.360 --> 01:17.520
'...mayhem...'
You fucking dickhead!

01:17.600 --> 01:20.000
(shouting)
'...and madness.'

01:21.160 --> 01:24.520
Oh!
'It's gonna get explosive.'

01:24.600 --> 01:26.120
Fucking what?!
Ooh!

01:26.200 --> 01:29.120
(shouting)
Fucking slag!

01:29.200 --> 01:31.480
'So far, seven exes have arrived.'

01:33.920 --> 01:36.880
I hate her guts.
Slag, slag, slag, slag, slag.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.400
Me heart is breaking.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.074

02:05.960 --> 02:10.080
Last night, Ross turned round and
said he doesn't want to be with me.

02:10.160 --> 02:14.360
He still thinks
I've got feelings for Jack.

02:14.440 --> 02:16.640
Just doesn't get me whatsoever.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.880
'The situation with Harriette,

02:19.960 --> 02:22.320
going over the same things
time after time.'

02:22.400 --> 02:25.600
If she can't stop arguing with
her ex, I can't be with her.

02:27.400 --> 02:29.360
'I'm gutted cos I do like the girl.'

02:29.440 --> 02:32.880
At the same time, I can't be with
someone who argues like that.

02:36.520 --> 02:40.160
So, my plan with Becca today
is crack on how we did yesterday.

02:40.240 --> 02:43.680
Me and her have a laugh together.
When it's me and her, we have fun.

02:43.760 --> 02:45.840
Whatever happens, happens.

02:45.920 --> 02:49.400
So, today, I need to apologise
to Aaron for screaming at him

02:49.480 --> 02:50.960
like I did last night.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.120
He doesn't wanna
speak to me any more.

02:53.200 --> 02:56.240
We're gonna have to,
cos we're living in the same house

02:56.320 --> 02:58.400
for however long.

02:58.480 --> 03:02.200
I don't mean to come in and be like,
"Oh, yeah, let's piss Aaron off."

03:02.280 --> 03:05.200
You haven't come here to see me,
to sort things out.

03:05.280 --> 03:07.120
I wanted to work things out.
No.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.840
'Becca said she came for me.'

03:08.920 --> 03:11.800
If that's the case,
she's got a funny way of showing it.

03:11.880 --> 03:14.560
cos if she's here for me,
why has she got with Jack?

03:14.640 --> 03:15.680
Don't understand.

03:15.760 --> 03:18.920
It's gonna be awkward as fuck now?
You just do your thing.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.880
All right. Do what you wanna do.
So you crack on.

03:21.960 --> 03:25.600
(sighs) At the end of the day,
in this fucking villa,

03:25.680 --> 03:29.080
you look after number one.
From now, that's what I'm gonna do.

03:30.480 --> 03:33.520
There's no point in me
having a conversation with Aaron

03:33.600 --> 03:37.040
until him and Becca
have 100% confirmed that is closure,

03:37.120 --> 03:38.640
it is over.

03:38.720 --> 03:40.640
Cos I'm not gonna look a dickhead.

03:42.320 --> 03:44.760
'Being in this villa with Adam
is intense.'

03:44.840 --> 03:46.640
We're not getting back together.

03:46.720 --> 03:49.000
Do what you got to do,
I'll do what I got to do.

03:49.080 --> 03:51.000
Don't talk to me,
I won't talk to you.

03:51.080 --> 03:54.640
If you was to fuck Maisie right now,
I wouldn't care.(laughter)

03:54.720 --> 03:57.840
I want someone to put a smile
on my face cos it's a new day.

03:57.920 --> 03:59.400
Why argue over yesterday?

03:59.480 --> 04:01.640
'The only thing
that could ruin my day

04:01.720 --> 04:04.320
is facing my ex-boyfriend,
Jacques Fraser,

04:04.400 --> 04:06.880
and all the shit I've heard
the last few days.'

04:06.960 --> 04:09.000
Apart from that,
I'm as happy as Larry.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.080
'You might be happy now, Nicole,

04:12.160 --> 04:13.880
but will anyone smile again

04:13.960 --> 04:17.360
when the next ex
gets washed up on the beach.'

04:17.440 --> 04:19.040
'T minus two hours.'

04:22.880 --> 04:25.120
'The Tablet of Terror
is feeling romantic

04:25.200 --> 04:27.280
and has cooked up a treat for
Aaron.'

04:27.360 --> 04:29.440
'A date with ZaraLena.

04:29.520 --> 04:32.040
Looks good, though.
Yeah, it look nice.

04:32.120 --> 04:36.320
I'm buzzing I'm with Zara cos
with me, she comes out of her shell.

04:36.400 --> 04:40.600
We're gonna have a few drinks, cook
some food and get a cheeky neck on.

04:40.680 --> 04:44.080
How are you feeling about things?
Are you glad to be here?

04:44.160 --> 04:47.880
I need reassurance from Aaron that
he and Becca have been put to bed,

04:47.960 --> 04:51.880
and I'm not gonna get mugged about.
If I wanted Becca, I would have her.

04:51.960 --> 04:55.680
Me and Zara are getting close.
Why would I want to be with Becca

04:55.760 --> 04:58.840
'when I can be with Zara?'
So you're 100% that that's it?

04:58.920 --> 05:01.600
If I went, "Lets get back together,"
she would.

05:01.680 --> 05:04.360
This is mine and your date.
Yeah.So fuck her.

05:04.440 --> 05:06.480
I'm buzzing that I'm here with you.

05:06.560 --> 05:10.720
Let's enjoy it, have a bit of crack,
have a fucking nice day.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.400
When Zara put that cucumber
in her mouth,

05:16.480 --> 05:19.320
something in my pants
Ramsay would be proud of.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.400
I'm not talking about a spatula.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.520
I'm getting amongst this.

05:23.600 --> 05:26.960
I'm mixing up this courgette mix,
and Aaron comes up behind me,

05:27.040 --> 05:30.880
grabs my little bosoms. They don't
have this on fucking MasterChef!

05:30.960 --> 05:32.720
Gives me a feel of his courgette.

05:32.800 --> 05:37.040
Something sticking in your back?
(laughs)Thought you had a cucumber.

05:37.120 --> 05:40.040
It was hot in that kitchen
but I've had my main course,

05:40.120 --> 05:44.160
and I'm going to get my dessert
and I'm gonna thoroughly enjoy it.

05:45.320 --> 05:47.560
'Aaron's planning on
good times later.'

05:47.640 --> 05:50.840
'Back at the villa,
any thoughts of fun might be ending

05:50.920 --> 05:53.000
any... time... now!'

05:53.080 --> 05:54.720
(laughs evilly)

05:56.360 --> 05:58.880
Tablet of Terror, fuck you.

06:00.320 --> 06:04.160
"Hello, everyone. Emotions have been
flying high in the villa,

06:04.240 --> 06:07.480
but it's what is lurking in the sea
you need to worry about."

06:07.560 --> 06:09.640
"Harriette..." Fuck.

06:09.720 --> 06:11.920
"...Nicole..."
For fuck's sake.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.480
"...and Rebecca, please go
to the beach to meet the next ex."

06:15.560 --> 06:16.960
(groaning)

06:17.040 --> 06:19.080
'My day is fucking shit so far.'

06:19.160 --> 06:21.440
Aaron's going on a date
with ZaraLena

06:21.520 --> 06:23.800
and I could have my ex
walking out the water.

06:23.880 --> 06:27.560
(Maisie) I was not expecting that.
Part of me does want my ex to come,

06:27.640 --> 06:30.080
so I can get the closure
I've been waiting for.

06:30.160 --> 06:33.200
Otherwise, I'm left
feeling like shit, like I am now.

06:33.280 --> 06:36.600
I don't think I can go there,
I swear to God. I feel sick.

06:36.680 --> 06:39.800
Since I told Nicole that
her ex-boyfriend cheated on her,

06:39.880 --> 06:43.720
her head's been all over the place.
Go on, Nic. Your girls are with you.

06:43.800 --> 06:47.800
If he does come today, she'll
get the answers she's looking for.

06:47.880 --> 06:50.760
And it could kick off
between me and him.

06:58.560 --> 07:01.200
This is bloody nerve-wrecking,
isn't it?

07:01.280 --> 07:03.320
It's been a really emotional day.

07:03.400 --> 07:06.440
I've had to leave Ross
and not talk to him.

07:06.520 --> 07:11.320
I could potentially be about to see
somebody I had something real with.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.840
I feel when I get out of here
there'll be two men

07:13.920 --> 07:16.960
outside the villa in white coats,
waiting to take me away.

07:18.440 --> 07:21.560
ZaraLena and Aaron are on a date.
That makes you feel shit.

07:21.640 --> 07:24.040
I hope they have
the worst date ever.

07:25.080 --> 07:29.600
Fucking feeling so stressed. (sniffs)
I mean... (sighs) Ah, fuck!

07:31.120 --> 07:34.720
I'm hoping and praying, babe,
your Jacques comes out of this.

07:34.800 --> 07:37.560
Me, too. Cos you need this.
You're going insane.

07:37.640 --> 07:41.040
I've literally not been sleeping.
I've not been myself.

07:41.120 --> 07:43.520
I'm dying inside cos all I want
is the answer

07:43.600 --> 07:45.520
to whether Jacques cheated or not.

07:45.600 --> 07:49.680
If that is true,
then I'm gonna be crushed to pieces.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.200
'While the girls shit themselves...'

08:06.560 --> 08:09.280
'...Ross is still dealing
with Harriette's crap.'

08:09.360 --> 08:11.640
She's not healthy for me.
I like her,

08:11.720 --> 08:14.200
as much as I care about her,
I can't be with her.

08:14.280 --> 08:18.440
Ross is confiding in me and Zahida
about the whole Harriette situation.

08:18.520 --> 08:21.480
He looks really torn up.
I really feel for the guy.

08:21.560 --> 08:24.880
Whether we work or not,
I want her to be happy.

08:24.960 --> 08:28.800
I want more with her, but...
the way she behaves, I can't.

08:28.880 --> 08:31.040
I-I can't physically.
I will go insane.

08:31.120 --> 08:33.440
'It's boring now,
Ross and Harriette.'

08:33.520 --> 08:37.520
It is Ex on the Beach, so either
get back together or just move on.

08:37.600 --> 08:41.200
I want her to fight before I say
it's done, do you know what I mean?

08:41.280 --> 08:45.560
But in my eyes, the way it is
right now, it is done.

08:45.640 --> 08:48.040
I just feel like... (sighs)

08:52.800 --> 08:53.920
...gutted.

08:54.920 --> 08:56.120
Give us a hug.

09:00.160 --> 09:01.440
Just give me a sec.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.680
I'm gonna piss myself.

09:12.680 --> 09:14.840
I'm so fucking nervous,
I'm sweating.

09:14.920 --> 09:18.600
I probably might shit my pants and
puke at the same time.(groaning)

09:18.680 --> 09:21.520
Fuck! I'm fucking shitting myself.

09:21.600 --> 09:25.560
Please be your ex.Fuck me,
I know it ain't. It's yours.

09:30.240 --> 09:31.480
I can't look.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.680
Ah, fuck!

09:46.560 --> 09:49.480
I'm so fucking happy it's not my ex.
You all right?

09:49.560 --> 09:51.320
'Oh, my God, it's Jacques.'

09:51.400 --> 09:54.240
Fucking hell, you are shitting me.

09:54.320 --> 09:56.360
I come here to tell you
I love you, Nic.

09:57.560 --> 09:59.400
I wanna get you back.

10:01.280 --> 10:03.680
Hi, I'm Jacques,
I'm from southeast London.

10:03.760 --> 10:06.080
I'd describe myself
as an absolute weapon.

10:06.160 --> 10:08.000
I look bank, from head to toe.

10:08.080 --> 10:12.160
When I go out, girls just flock me.
These teeth are like pussy magnets.

10:12.240 --> 10:16.000
Last year, I went on holiday,
banged three birds in one day.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.680
Hashtag lad.

10:20.880 --> 10:23.440
My ex Nicole,
she was like the love of my life.

10:23.520 --> 10:26.360
I could see myself marrying her.
Now I'm riding solo.

10:26.440 --> 10:29.400
I'd get back with Nicole
in a heartbeat, 100%.

10:29.480 --> 10:31.000
She's the one that got away.

10:32.120 --> 10:33.720
(sighs) Fuck's sake.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.680
Seeing Jacques is so emotional.
I've got to be strong.

10:36.760 --> 10:38.520
I need to ask him some questions.

10:38.600 --> 10:41.360
Adam told me
that you cheated on me in Ibiza.

10:41.440 --> 10:42.840
He's chatting shit.

10:42.920 --> 10:45.920
Adam's talking shit,
saying I slept with a girl

10:46.000 --> 10:47.840
'I'm fuming, absolutely fuming.'

10:47.920 --> 10:50.520
She was caught coming out the room.
Bullshit.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.960
So, they weren't in the room?
No-one was.

10:53.040 --> 10:55.760
Fucking angry, mate. Bad.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.200
I love you more than anything.
What we had was special.

11:00.280 --> 11:05.120
I'm not looking to throw it away.
Like I'm gonna cheat on you!

11:05.200 --> 11:08.800
My emotions are all over.
I cannot believe what has happened.

11:12.680 --> 11:14.720
My heart is praying it's not true,

11:14.800 --> 11:17.560
cos I see myself
spending my life with him.

11:17.640 --> 11:19.520
'So I do believe what he's saying.'

11:23.520 --> 11:27.240
(Becca) She's been so upset.
I love you so fucking much, Nic.

11:28.240 --> 11:31.040
I'm happy. I think
Nicole believes what I am saying.

11:31.120 --> 11:34.240
To secure Nicole,
I'm gonna show her I love her.

11:34.320 --> 11:36.920
I've brought the necklace
you threw at me as well.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.160
Aw!

11:38.240 --> 11:41.200
Nicole's in shock.
She can't believe what's going on.

11:41.280 --> 11:43.440
She genuinely likes this guy.

11:43.520 --> 11:45.320
I think she loves this guy.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.760
Turn round.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.680
I love my necklace.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.000
It's very pretty.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.320
What we've got is special.
I love him so much.

12:00.400 --> 12:03.640
How are you gonna cope,
knowing that Adam's in there,

12:03.720 --> 12:07.320
trying to stir and wind her up?
Fuming. I'll go off my fucking nut.

12:07.400 --> 12:10.680
Jacques is built like
an absolute brick shithouse.

12:10.760 --> 12:13.400
If I was Adam,
I'd have a squeaky bumhole.

12:15.920 --> 12:18.000
'The Tablet of Terror
is feeling brave

12:18.080 --> 12:21.920
and has let everyone loose from
the villa for a night out clubbing.'

12:22.000 --> 12:24.680
We are fucking buzzing.
We are out the villa,

12:24.760 --> 12:27.200
I guarantee everyone
will have a good night.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.560
Let's have it then.

12:28.640 --> 12:31.480
Let's have a good night.
Hopefully no arguments,

12:31.560 --> 12:34.560
but you never know
who's gonna walk through that door.

12:34.640 --> 12:35.680
(all) Cheers.

12:35.760 --> 12:37.720
Put the fucking tunes on!

12:46.520 --> 12:49.480
I get to spend the night with Zara.
She looks fit as fuck.

12:49.560 --> 12:52.040
I just hope Becca
doesn't fuck shit up.

12:56.120 --> 12:59.160
(laughter)
'Everyone's having a sick time.'

12:59.240 --> 13:02.240
Thoughts of Nicole and her ex coming
is in my mind.

13:02.320 --> 13:04.240
I don't want that
to fuck up the mood.

13:04.320 --> 13:05.880
He comes in calm, I'll chat.

13:05.960 --> 13:09.320
But if he comes in like...
my head's gonna go, bruv.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.720
No. Fuck this geezer.
He ain't Superman.

13:11.800 --> 13:15.360
If Nicole's ex walks in, I think
he's gonna come in all guns blazing.

13:15.440 --> 13:19.360
If he does, I'm gonna kick off.
If he storms in, I'll grab him.

13:19.440 --> 13:20.840
It might not even happen.

13:20.920 --> 13:23.440
(talk over each other)
It might not even be him.

13:25.480 --> 13:26.720
'Unlucky, Adam.'

13:26.800 --> 13:28.560
'Here comes Jacques!'

13:30.480 --> 13:32.000
Boom! Here we gan.

13:33.760 --> 13:36.320
The girls walk in
with a fucking stump.

13:36.400 --> 13:39.040
(girl) Who's this geezer?
'Fuck.'

13:39.120 --> 13:43.080
He looks pissed off. I know he's
coming over to me to ask me about

13:43.160 --> 13:45.600
the cheating.
I thought better of you, mate.

13:45.680 --> 13:47.680
Huh?
I said, I thought better of you.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.840
Talking like girls in hairdressers.
I don't chat shit.

13:50.920 --> 13:54.320
I just told Nicole what I heard.
Saying a girl walked out my room?

13:54.400 --> 13:56.960
(they talk over each other)
Jacques. Jacques.

13:57.040 --> 14:00.280
Get out my way. Talk to me, innit.
'By the look on their faces,'

14:00.360 --> 14:02.040
they're about to go off.

14:02.120 --> 14:04.600
I heard that she left your room
in Ibiza...

14:04.680 --> 14:07.600
Bruv, that's what I heard.
He said, she said bullshit.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.320
Bullshit! Fucking bullshit.

14:09.400 --> 14:11.960
Fucking fuming.
It's all fucking rumours.

14:12.040 --> 14:13.640
'It's all muggy, mate.'

14:13.720 --> 14:15.840
Come on, chat to me. Chat to me.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.480
Chat to me.
You banged her.

14:17.560 --> 14:19.320
Nah, mate. Yeah.
Didn't happen.

14:19.400 --> 14:23.400
I thought better of you. Wait, bruv,
listen to what I'm saying to you.

14:23.480 --> 14:26.840
Jacques's denying cheating,
so if he wants to deny it,

14:26.920 --> 14:29.760
and she wants to believe him,
that's up to her.

14:30.760 --> 14:33.520
'I'll kill it for now
cos I don't want more dramas.'

14:33.600 --> 14:36.440
All I care about is what Nic thinks.

14:36.520 --> 14:38.480
So the fact is
you ain't cheated on me?

14:38.560 --> 14:42.000
Course I ain't! You think I'd
come here if I did? Are you serious?

14:42.080 --> 14:44.360
Are you gonna...
I ain't believing no-one.

14:44.440 --> 14:48.000
I'm just asking you a question.
I just told you no. Simple as that.

14:48.080 --> 14:50.120
Nicole clearly believes Jacques,

14:50.200 --> 14:54.000
but at the end of the day,
I think he might be lying.

14:54.080 --> 14:55.280
(whistles)

14:56.280 --> 14:58.280
Me and Jacques have got to talk.

14:58.360 --> 15:01.000
At the end of the day,
if he's done nothing wrong,

15:01.080 --> 15:03.320
I understand why he's angry.

15:03.400 --> 15:07.040
Are we back together now or what?
Well, I'm not gonna just say yeah.

15:07.120 --> 15:09.880
You have to prove...
I need to talk to you about this.

15:09.960 --> 15:11.360
This is the wrong place.

15:11.440 --> 15:14.240
Yes, I believe him but I wanna
get to the bottom of it.

15:14.320 --> 15:16.160
How would you feel if that was you?

15:16.240 --> 15:17.440
I'd believe you.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.640
But if you did that,
you're a scumbag.

15:21.680 --> 15:23.320
Oh, my God. It didn't happen.

15:24.320 --> 15:25.560
I promise you that now.

15:28.480 --> 15:30.920
I'm hoping me and Jacques
can get through this

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
cos I do love him,
more than anything.

15:33.080 --> 15:35.280
I like to think
we're stronger than this.

15:44.840 --> 15:46.720
It's kicking off with everyone,

15:46.800 --> 15:50.640
which means me and Harriette
still haven't had a chance to chat.

15:51.640 --> 15:54.960
I see Ross, I'm not gonna lie,
my heart's pumping.

15:55.040 --> 15:59.720
'I just wanna get Ross alone so we
can completely sort out everything.'

16:01.480 --> 16:03.960
As much as I say
I don't wanna be with Harriette,

16:04.040 --> 16:06.240
something always
draws me back to her.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.200
I really missed you.

16:11.760 --> 16:14.160
I missed you, too.
You know I've missed you.

16:15.160 --> 16:16.680
I've had a shit day.

16:16.760 --> 16:18.120
I've had a shit day.

16:22.320 --> 16:23.640
Nice blazer.

16:26.960 --> 16:30.600
I've got massive amounts of feelings
for her, and I can't help...

16:31.600 --> 16:35.320
When I see her, no matter how much
she's pissed me off...

16:36.320 --> 16:38.440
I just want to sort it out with her.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.640
What happened on the date?

16:49.720 --> 16:51.000
I don't wanna talk.

16:51.080 --> 16:53.800
Becca walks over,
why's she trying to talk to me?

16:53.880 --> 16:57.040
'I'm not gonna let her try to
wind us up or spoil my night.'

16:57.120 --> 16:59.280
Chat all you want.
I don't give a fuck.

16:59.360 --> 17:02.200
No! Oi! Hold on.
I don't care.

17:02.280 --> 17:03.960
Aaron! Aaron! Aaron!

17:04.040 --> 17:06.599
(sighs) Just fucking storms off,
as per usual.

17:06.680 --> 17:08.920
'Fucking only asked him
about his date.'

17:09.000 --> 17:12.160
He still won't fucking speak to me.
Yet again.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.640
Fucking pisses me off.

17:13.720 --> 17:17.240
Becca's kicking off because she
wants her cake and wants to eat it.

17:17.319 --> 17:21.319
She wants me exactly where she used
to have us, but also she wants Jack.

17:21.400 --> 17:24.319
Here, Zara, tell me
what happened on your date, please.

17:24.400 --> 17:27.440
Cos he fucking won't tell me
what's gone on on the date.

17:27.520 --> 17:30.800
Go on the date, it's a meal,
like, we're making food.

17:30.880 --> 17:34.720
I don't give a fuck about that.
Did yous fucking neck on? We kissed.

17:34.800 --> 17:38.560
Aaron and ZaraLena kissed.
Are you fucking serious?

17:38.640 --> 17:40.800
He can get fucked, I swear to God.

17:40.880 --> 17:42.920
I thought, "Oh, you fucking mug."

17:43.000 --> 17:46.320
It's only because I'm here
that you're not banging him. No.

17:46.400 --> 17:49.920
This situation...
I want another drink, please.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.400
Can I get another drink?
Can we please have a drink?

17:55.120 --> 17:57.000
'ZaraLena needs refreshments,

17:57.080 --> 17:59.760
but who is going to get a nasty
taste from their past

17:59.840 --> 18:03.400
when the next ex is served up
on the beach of doom?'

18:04.400 --> 18:06.000
(laughs evilly)

18:07.760 --> 18:09.720
'With everyone back at the villa,

18:09.800 --> 18:13.000
Harriette's finally laying
her heart on the line to Ross.'

18:13.080 --> 18:16.480
I went down the beach today,
and somebody that I've been with

18:16.560 --> 18:20.120
and I've loved could walk in,
and all I can think about is you.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.880
I feel like me and Ross
need to up our level,

18:23.960 --> 18:26.400
and I'm ready to tell him
how I feel.

18:26.480 --> 18:30.120
I've realised that...
I am falling for you.

18:30.200 --> 18:33.880
And if you was to turn round
and tell me that you...

18:33.960 --> 18:37.000
you don't wanna be with me...

18:41.200 --> 18:44.320
Well, that would, erm,
really fucking hurt.

18:46.320 --> 18:48.640
She's saying
she's started to fall for me.

18:59.160 --> 19:02.320
'I feel like right now...
it's not gonna be a quick fix,'

19:02.400 --> 19:03.800
but...

19:09.840 --> 19:12.640
I do care about her.
I do like her.

19:13.640 --> 19:16.320
'So,
it looks like I'm back to Harriette.'

19:16.400 --> 19:18.120
'I'm gonna make a go of things.'

19:23.480 --> 19:25.440
'Me and Aaron, we had a great day,

19:25.520 --> 19:29.280
and then as soon as Becca's back,
it's like his head goes west.'

19:30.280 --> 19:33.760
I think it's safe to say I'm gonna
go to bed on my own tonight.

19:36.760 --> 19:39.280
I find Becca confusing,
cracking on with Jack.

19:39.360 --> 19:40.680
Fuck this.

19:40.760 --> 19:44.000
What the fuck is she playing at?
She either wants him or me.

19:44.080 --> 19:45.800
Can't have fucking both, babe.

19:45.880 --> 19:48.560
Do you wanna be with me?
Look at me on in my face.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.360
Do you wanna be with me?

19:50.440 --> 19:53.400
Exactly. Becca's doing it
to piss as off. I know she is.

19:53.480 --> 19:56.360
Hang on, you've been saying
you're getting with Zara.

19:56.440 --> 19:59.440
Why do I wanna get with you
if you're seeing someone?

19:59.520 --> 20:04.200
I'm in bed, I can hear Aaron and
Becca fucking cat-and-dogging it.

20:04.280 --> 20:06.920
Is it tit for tat?
It's not tit for tat.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.240
It is!
Is that you want?

20:08.320 --> 20:11.040
With Jacques on one arm
and Aaron on the other.

20:11.120 --> 20:14.880
I don't know if I wanna be with
Aaron. He's been messing with Zara.

20:14.960 --> 20:16.560
It's tit for tat.
It's not.

20:16.640 --> 20:19.800
You've been mugging me off
since I fucking came in here.

20:22.680 --> 20:25.520
If you wanted me to mug you off,
in the next five days

20:25.600 --> 20:27.320
I will fucking mug you clean off.

20:27.400 --> 20:30.120
I will shag every bird
that walks in, I will shag her,

20:30.200 --> 20:33.920
laugh in your fucking face. You want
me to be a cunt, I'll be a cunt.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.240
Just to interrupt this,
er, personal one-on-one,

20:37.320 --> 20:41.560
I'm out anyway, so I'm nothing
to worry about in this situation.

20:41.640 --> 20:44.080
Cos... I'm out of it.

20:46.080 --> 20:50.160
Aaron's made it very clear.
He's in here, he's no attachments.

20:51.520 --> 20:52.800
Whatever.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.080
Whatever.

20:55.080 --> 20:56.200
Fucking done.

20:56.880 --> 20:59.560
That's a nice girl,
who's done nothing wrong.

20:59.640 --> 21:02.240
(sighs) This fucking... shit.

21:03.960 --> 21:07.000
Aaron and me have both
got our guard up with each other,

21:07.080 --> 21:09.000
cos we've hurt each other so much,

21:09.080 --> 21:11.640
and all we do now
is fucking scream and shout.

21:11.720 --> 21:14.880
I will mug you off every fucking day
a new girl comes in.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.400
What did you fucking say?

21:17.480 --> 21:19.760
If I wanna mug you off...
What did you say?

21:19.840 --> 21:23.120
If I want to, I will mug you off...
Fucking go on, then!

21:23.200 --> 21:26.600
I don't want to, you fucking dick!
Why d'you even say it, then?

21:26.680 --> 21:30.200
You're trying to make us bite.
(they shout over each other)

21:30.280 --> 21:31.920
You're trying to make me bite.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.280
(sighs) I fucking hate screaming
and shouting with him all the time.

21:36.360 --> 21:37.960
Everything's a fucking mess.

21:44.360 --> 21:47.440
'It's all become
a frustrating mess for Becca,

21:47.520 --> 21:52.080
but upstairs, new arrival Jacques
Fraser is getting some relief.'

21:52.160 --> 21:55.200
I've cleared the issues up with Nic,
but at the same time,

21:55.280 --> 21:56.800
I'm still got the hump.'

21:59.400 --> 22:01.400
I come on, told Nic I want her back,

22:01.480 --> 22:03.440
I love her,
and I got a good reception.

22:03.520 --> 22:06.120
The way things are going,
I think we're all cool.

22:09.600 --> 22:12.000
'Yep, I think you might be right,
Jacques.'

22:31.760 --> 22:34.640
I've woke up next to Harriette.
We had a little spoon.

22:34.720 --> 22:37.280
She apologised to me,
which I wanted her to do.

22:37.360 --> 22:40.800
I actually did finally tell him
I was falling for him.

22:40.880 --> 22:43.760
I am enjoying being with him,
spending time with him.

22:43.840 --> 22:47.440
So I do feel like things
are finally on track again.

22:54.640 --> 22:58.760
I woke up in the penthouse with Nic?
Did you have sex in there or not?

22:58.840 --> 23:01.400
Of course we fucked.
What do you think we done?

23:01.480 --> 23:04.360
Good girl and good lad!

23:04.440 --> 23:06.960
At the minute
we are still working things out,

23:07.040 --> 23:08.160
but it's going good.

23:08.240 --> 23:12.360
There's something Jacques does to
me, I can't stay angry at him long.

23:12.440 --> 23:15.640
Thing is, I think, as a girl,
you know when someone's lying.

23:15.720 --> 23:17.240
I don't think he would lie.

23:17.320 --> 23:19.960
I'm hoping we can
sort our relationship out.

23:20.040 --> 23:23.160
If I found out he was lying,
I'd cut his fucking penis off.

23:23.240 --> 23:26.280
That's a liberty, mate.
That's a fucking liberty!

23:29.600 --> 23:33.120
There's clearly unfinished business
between Aaron and Becca.

23:33.200 --> 23:36.440
Every time they have a drink,
the truth comes out.

23:38.200 --> 23:41.440
The thing with Zara, we take
two steps forward and one back.

23:41.520 --> 23:45.880
After the date, I was sure that we
were gonna get it on and have sex,

23:45.960 --> 23:47.760
but Becca seemed to fuck that up.

23:49.040 --> 23:52.040
I still wanna fucking talk to Aaron
so much.

23:52.120 --> 23:56.320
It's driving me fucking nuts cos
all we do is scream at each other.

23:57.320 --> 23:59.400
There's no way
I can continue with Jack

23:59.480 --> 24:01.840
until me and Aaron
have sorted things out.

24:03.680 --> 24:06.360
Becca and Aaron
still ain't had this chat.

24:06.440 --> 24:09.200
I don't think they're gonna.
Fuck the chat now.

24:09.280 --> 24:11.920
What's there to talk about?
I'm waking up to her,

24:12.000 --> 24:13.360
so I'm gonna crack on.

24:13.440 --> 24:16.400
I reckon if I can get Becca
in the penthouse tonight,

24:16.480 --> 24:19.240
after a couple of drinks,
then, yeah, it's game on.

24:20.840 --> 24:23.040
'Jack's up for some action
with Becca,

24:23.120 --> 24:25.720
but who will need
extra-strength protection

24:25.800 --> 24:28.480
when the next ex washes ashore?'

24:28.560 --> 24:30.080
(laughs evilly)

24:32.840 --> 24:35.840
'The tablet has given everyone
a chance to be hard

24:35.920 --> 24:37.680
and shoot their loads.'

24:37.760 --> 24:39.640
'Time to rise to the occasion.'

24:39.720 --> 24:43.760
Fucking sweet. We're at Laser Quest
and I'm feeling like fucking Rambo.

24:45.160 --> 24:46.760
Team, I'll put your hats on.

24:46.840 --> 24:49.320
Fucking...
I think I look good with a gun.

24:49.400 --> 24:50.640
I look a bit 'ard.

24:50.720 --> 24:52.760
Our team name is Shooting Blanks.

24:52.840 --> 24:53.880
What's yours?

24:53.960 --> 24:56.160
Goldfinger.
(laughter)

24:56.240 --> 24:58.280
'Josh called his team Goldfinger.'

24:58.360 --> 25:01.400
With the little action he's had,
more like rusty fingers.

25:01.480 --> 25:04.360
One, two, three, Goldfinger!

25:04.440 --> 25:06.440
One, two, three, wargh!

25:06.520 --> 25:08.520
Sergeant Ross reporting for duty.

25:08.600 --> 25:10.040
(boy grunts)

25:10.120 --> 25:13.280
Let's fucking have you!
Come on, then, you cunt!

25:16.720 --> 25:20.520
I'm buzzing. I was made for this.
I'm nailing it, getting everyone.

25:22.120 --> 25:23.440
They're going down.

25:27.200 --> 25:28.640
(hoots)

25:31.680 --> 25:34.840
(Zahida) We're having a wicked time
at Laser Quest,

25:34.920 --> 25:38.360
but me and Josh want a chat
with Nicole now Jacques is here.

25:38.440 --> 25:42.200
We want to know how she's feeling.
What's between you and Jacques?

25:42.280 --> 25:44.160
We're gonna see how things go.

25:44.240 --> 25:46.280
You're letting him off too easily,

25:46.360 --> 25:50.320
cos he's been here one day so far,
and you believed him straight away.

25:50.400 --> 25:53.320
I know Jacques inside and out.
I know when he's lying.

25:53.400 --> 25:54.680
And he's not lying to me.

25:54.760 --> 25:56.600
I think she's being too naive,

25:56.680 --> 25:59.360
believing what Jacques Fraser's
saying to her.

25:59.440 --> 26:02.720
I think some boys
say anything they absolutely can

26:02.800 --> 26:05.240
for you not to doubt them
or what they've done.

26:05.320 --> 26:06.840
Yeah, but I'm not thick.

26:06.920 --> 26:10.400
I think Zahida and Josh were trying
to protect me, look out for me.

26:10.480 --> 26:11.800
I'd do the same for them.

26:11.880 --> 26:16.120
I know him better than anyone. It's
my choice. I'll do what I wanna do.

26:22.360 --> 26:26.160
(Jack) Becca's on my team. I'm
trying to run round, get my aim on,

26:26.240 --> 26:29.960
and all I see is her arse jiggling,
fucking distracting me.

26:30.960 --> 26:33.920
'Well, Jack,
now Becca's got her own distraction.'

26:34.000 --> 26:35.320
(she laughs)

26:35.400 --> 26:36.800
I need to speak to you.

26:36.880 --> 26:41.040
'It looks like the big chat with
Aaron is finally about to happen.'

26:41.120 --> 26:43.120
'In the middle of a war zone.'

26:44.280 --> 26:46.600
I want an explanation
why you left for Oz.

26:46.680 --> 26:49.880
We were both hurting.
We weren't working at all, were we?

26:49.960 --> 26:51.200
I think you know that.

26:51.280 --> 26:53.840
There's ways and means
of dealing with things.

26:53.920 --> 26:56.280
I know, but... (stutters)
To up and leave...

26:57.840 --> 27:00.600
It's fucking awful
to know how much I've hurt him.

27:00.680 --> 27:02.280
I'm sorry for what I've done.

27:02.360 --> 27:06.120
Sorry for packing up and leaving to
Australia, leaving you how I left.

27:08.120 --> 27:10.040
See, this is the thing, like.

27:11.160 --> 27:14.040
Even if I wanted to
get back with you, right...

27:14.120 --> 27:15.360
Which I probably do.

27:16.360 --> 27:18.360
I don't... I don't think I could.

27:21.120 --> 27:23.880
My head's all over the place
and my feelings are raw.

27:23.960 --> 27:27.280
I don't know what I want. I like
Zara, but I'm in love with Becca,

27:27.360 --> 27:29.200
so it's fucking hard.

27:29.280 --> 27:30.760
You don't wanna be with us?

27:30.840 --> 27:33.560
It's not that I don't.
We haven't even tried, man.

27:33.640 --> 27:36.320
There's still something, 100%,
with me and Aaron.

27:38.040 --> 27:40.400
'I still proper care for him loads.'

27:40.480 --> 27:45.040
But half the time he's with another
girl and it's like... (groans)

27:47.240 --> 27:51.800
I could see on the course today,
you were looking for me.(giggles)

27:51.880 --> 27:54.280
Aye, you were. You were.
I was.I know you was.

27:54.360 --> 27:58.000
Looking for that tattooed body
swinging around! Really?

27:58.080 --> 27:59.440
Yeah, I was.

28:01.360 --> 28:05.200
'I still care about her, so it's
hard to have this conversation.'

28:05.280 --> 28:08.960
I just hope tonight, when we've
had a drink, we don't start arguing.

28:09.040 --> 28:10.960
Nah,
just have a think what you want.

28:12.080 --> 28:13.920
And I will as well.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.560
Let's see how the next few days
pan out.

28:27.640 --> 28:29.760
'The Tablet of Terror must have a bug

28:29.840 --> 28:34.080
because it sent Jacques and Maisie
on a 'make a wish' date.'

28:34.160 --> 28:37.320
Basically I just need
a bit of fresh cock in the villa.

28:37.400 --> 28:38.480
(snickers)

28:38.560 --> 28:40.800
'Right you are, Maisie.
Loud and clear.'

28:40.880 --> 28:43.600
I mean, it was pretty, like, dry
for a while.

28:44.880 --> 28:48.520
Right now I need a few genuine guys
to come in who are up for a laugh.

28:48.600 --> 28:51.040
I want someone
I can chill with, drink with,

28:51.120 --> 28:52.400
just have a good time.

28:53.480 --> 28:55.240
And some sex, obviously.

28:55.320 --> 28:57.440
So, how is the villa going for you
so far?

28:57.520 --> 28:59.400
I've still gotta talk to Nicole.

28:59.480 --> 29:01.520
I don't feel
I've got the time to do that

29:01.600 --> 29:03.200
with all the drama going on.

29:03.280 --> 29:06.680
Do you want her back?The only
reason I've come is to get her back.

29:06.760 --> 29:09.240
Fair play to Jacques,
he's really opening up,

29:09.320 --> 29:11.440
saying things
I didn't think he'd say.

29:11.520 --> 29:13.800
What's the, like,
answer to the rumours?

29:13.880 --> 29:17.240
It's not true. It's mixed up
information, he said, she said.

29:17.320 --> 29:20.560
If she decides she can't
get over it...What can I do?

29:20.640 --> 29:22.880
I'm not gonna sit there and...
Beg and...

29:22.960 --> 29:26.200
Yeah, course not. It is what it is.
Like, I want my pal back.

29:27.160 --> 29:28.560
(chuckles)

29:28.640 --> 29:32.760
What me and Nic had was special.
I don't want to leave without her.

29:35.760 --> 29:37.640
I've got a few wishes
I wanna make.

29:37.720 --> 29:40.400
Mainly sexual ones. Erm...
(snickers)

29:40.480 --> 29:43.240
So I think...
I reckon we should light a candle.

29:43.320 --> 29:45.440
I know what you're gonna wish for.

29:45.520 --> 29:49.000
Jacques puts a candle in the water
and wishes he could go back,

29:49.080 --> 29:51.400
chat with Nicole,
get everything sorted.

29:51.480 --> 29:53.640
'I took it as more of a jokey wish.'

29:55.200 --> 29:58.480
I'm wishing to...
new cock in the villa,

29:58.560 --> 30:00.680
and for this new cock
to want some of me.

30:00.760 --> 30:02.360
Wahey!
(laughs)

30:02.440 --> 30:06.040
Right, I feel like if this fucks up,
I'm not going to get any willy.

30:08.400 --> 30:09.640
(music stops)

30:09.720 --> 30:13.120
(laughs)
Well, that's the end of that one.

30:14.920 --> 30:18.400
Cheers to Jacques and Maisie's date.
Oh, yeah!

30:18.480 --> 30:20.680
Cheers to Jacques and Maisie's date.

30:21.680 --> 30:25.560
I really ain't worried about the
date. I trust Jacques with Maisie.

30:25.640 --> 30:27.520
If he does something, he's stupid.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.760
He'll be spooning
his fucking pillow.

30:29.840 --> 30:31.400
(cheering)

30:31.480 --> 30:34.560
We're playing Spin the Bottle,
but there's a twist.

30:34.640 --> 30:36.680
'You tell what you're thinking.'

30:36.760 --> 30:38.920
This is gonna fuck shit up.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.880
(cheering)

30:40.960 --> 30:44.240
I secretly think you like Aaron
more than you say you do.

30:44.320 --> 30:46.120
The more I get to know Aaron...

30:46.200 --> 30:48.520
You're not gonna get to
know him any more.

30:48.600 --> 30:50.960
(boys) Oh!

30:52.080 --> 30:55.320
The truth's coming out tonight.
Not that I didn't predict it.

30:55.400 --> 30:58.000
There's still feelings
between Aaron and Becca.

30:58.080 --> 30:59.960
(boy) Go on, girl!

31:00.040 --> 31:02.880
Just be honest, babe,
and I'll fucking back off.

31:02.960 --> 31:05.240
I'm not fighting a tripod situation.

31:08.560 --> 31:11.440
'While ZaraLena takes herself
out of the equation,

31:11.520 --> 31:13.960
Jack's hoping
all his efforts add up.'

31:14.040 --> 31:16.240
Obviously, where, like...

31:16.320 --> 31:18.520
where you said, like,
"Oh, I wanna st..."

31:18.600 --> 31:22.320
"You ain't getting to know Zara
any more," that looks muggy on me.

31:22.400 --> 31:23.880
You're not getting mugged.

31:23.960 --> 31:26.480
'Aaron and Becca
still have that chemistry.'

31:26.560 --> 31:30.240
To me, it's hard for me to crack on
when they still got that chemistry.

31:31.320 --> 31:33.200
At the end of the day, listen,

31:33.280 --> 31:36.160
like, you and Aaron
have been together for a while.

31:36.240 --> 31:40.160
I understand emotions are involved.
I haven't seen him in so long.

31:40.240 --> 31:42.440
It's hard to see him
with someone else.

31:42.520 --> 31:44.800
I am a little jealous
fucking psychopath.

31:44.880 --> 31:47.880
So if he's pissing me off,
I'm gonna say about it.

31:49.200 --> 31:53.760
I care a lot about Aaron and I've
told Jack I still care about him.

31:53.840 --> 31:55.760
I think he's all right with that.

31:57.240 --> 31:59.800
What I wanted to say was
you're fit as fuck,

31:59.880 --> 32:01.440
so I'd long it anyway.

32:01.520 --> 32:05.040
'I basically just put it out.
"Well, I fancy you to bits."'

32:05.120 --> 32:08.040
D'you know what I mean?
I wanna sort of crack on with you.

32:08.120 --> 32:11.560
At the end of the day... of course
she's gonna fancy me in here.

32:11.640 --> 32:12.920
D'you know what I mean?

32:22.080 --> 32:23.480
Nicole.

32:24.760 --> 32:25.840
Kissing.

32:27.040 --> 32:29.480
I played Spin the Bottle
and I did kiss.

32:29.560 --> 32:31.880
Not tongues. Just a friendly...

32:31.960 --> 32:33.840
(Josh) Roll this one round again.

32:33.920 --> 32:36.480
(Jack) Nic! Nicole Bass .

32:36.560 --> 32:40.720
I dare Nicole and Bec...
(boys) To neck on!...to neck on.

32:40.800 --> 32:42.840
One, two, three, go!

32:42.920 --> 32:44.720
One, two...

32:44.800 --> 32:46.600
I am loving this!

32:46.680 --> 32:50.800
...three, four, five....

32:50.880 --> 32:52.920
I'm getting a lob on.
...six, seven...

32:53.000 --> 32:55.040
I've got a semi.
Ten seconds!

32:57.360 --> 33:00.640
(girls cheer)
First time I've had a semi in here.

33:00.720 --> 33:03.880
We're having such a good night,
nothing can spoil this.

33:06.240 --> 33:10.120
(cheering) So Jacques and I
get back to the villa,

33:10.200 --> 33:13.280
stand at the bar,
telling everyone how the date went,

33:13.360 --> 33:15.640
and it all just seemed
fucking awkward.

33:15.720 --> 33:19.080
(Zahida) First question,
did you neck on?No.

33:19.160 --> 33:20.240
Did you kiss?
Nope.

33:20.320 --> 33:22.200
Did you even think about a kiss?
No.

33:22.280 --> 33:23.800
Go anywhere near a kiss?
No.

33:23.880 --> 33:25.320
Did he have a stiffy?
Nope.

33:25.400 --> 33:27.080
Did Maisie put it on you?
Nope.

33:27.160 --> 33:31.280
We've been playing Spin the Bottle.
As newcomers, I've got one spin.

33:31.360 --> 33:34.360
It landed on Jacques.
Dare you to neck on with ZaraLena.

33:34.440 --> 33:36.440
He's not gonna fucking do that.

33:36.520 --> 33:39.200
Well, I fucking kissed Jack.
(music stops)

33:39.280 --> 33:41.240
What?

33:41.320 --> 33:44.680
Are you fucking serious?
Why are you giving me dirty looks?

33:44.760 --> 33:47.760
I wanna talk.About?
How you're acting around your exes.

33:47.840 --> 33:51.600
That's how I'm fuming about. Pisses
me off, mate. Every cunt can see it.

33:51.680 --> 33:52.760
That is muggy.

33:52.840 --> 33:55.400
(shout over each other)
They're my friends.

33:55.480 --> 33:58.760
Be friends, but there's friendship
and taking the piss.

33:58.840 --> 34:01.920
Like coming in here
and finding out you cheated on me?

34:02.000 --> 34:04.520
I didn't cheat on you.
It's rumours, mate.Mm.

34:05.560 --> 34:07.520
I wanna talk. Let's go for a chat.

34:07.600 --> 34:09.280
She's getting me angry now.

34:19.920 --> 34:21.679
You're more like that with them.

34:21.760 --> 34:25.400
I'm upset about the way she's been
acting around her ex-boyfriends.

34:27.199 --> 34:30.840
It's upsetting me. I feel like
she's spending more time with them,

34:30.920 --> 34:32.440
and it's mugging me off.

34:37.880 --> 34:41.719
But with that comes pain and
when you hurt someone, they change.

34:44.280 --> 34:46.320
Cos I love you
and I want us to work out.

34:46.400 --> 34:49.920
I don't want anyone else. I'd have
cracked on with someone else.

34:50.000 --> 34:53.080
Jacques Fraser's saying
I'm always with other people.

34:53.159 --> 34:54.920
I need to sort this shit out.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.120
What we've got is real
and I do love you.

34:57.200 --> 34:59.520
I've been hurt
and I couldn't get over...

34:59.600 --> 35:03.160
Tried talking to you about it...
I never moved on in here or in life.

35:03.240 --> 35:07.360
I didn't wanna hurt you. Two wrongs
don't make a right. I love you.

35:07.440 --> 35:10.280
Well, I feel like we have had
a proper conversation,

35:10.360 --> 35:14.160
so now I feel we can actually
move on and be how we used to be.

35:14.240 --> 35:17.920
I love you and I wanna be with you.
I want us to be how we used to be.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.680
And I love you, too,
and I wanna be with you, too.

35:20.760 --> 35:24.440
Can we put the past behind us and
try and move forward? Yeah, we can.

35:24.520 --> 35:26.560
We can.
As a team?

35:26.640 --> 35:29.200
I love Jacques Fraser to pieces.

35:30.400 --> 35:33.440
We're in a strong place.
I'm not worried about any exes,

35:33.520 --> 35:37.440
or any ex-girlfriends for him.
Nothing can ever split as up.

35:37.520 --> 35:39.840
'You say that now, Nicole,

35:39.920 --> 35:43.520
but more exes are on their way
to dish the dirt.'

35:43.600 --> 35:47.920
'Whose ex is next?'
(laughs evilly)

35:50.720 --> 35:52.360
(groaning, shouting)

35:52.440 --> 35:55.560
Fuck off, you little mug.
(laughter)

35:57.080 --> 35:59.200
"Hello, everyone."
(boy)Hi.

35:59.280 --> 36:04.040
"Rebecca, it's time to find out who
really has your heart."Fuck off.

36:04.120 --> 36:07.440
"You must choose Jack Devlin...

36:07.520 --> 36:13.360
or Aaron to take to the penthouse."
(laughter, indistinct speech)

36:14.400 --> 36:16.480
Things could get fucking awkward.

36:16.560 --> 36:19.440
'Tablet of Terror goes off
and gives Becca an option.'

36:19.520 --> 36:22.200
Who do you want to take
to the penthouse? Me or Jack.

36:22.280 --> 36:25.480
After the chat today, I can
assure you she's gonna pick me.

36:25.560 --> 36:27.640
We all know it.
Oh, that's not funny.

36:27.720 --> 36:31.240
Just put it out on the line, mate.
I don't...Be straight, innit.

36:31.320 --> 36:34.480
'Been thinking about banging Becca
soon as she walked in.'

36:34.560 --> 36:37.720
She's right my type.
Hopefully she picks me.

36:37.800 --> 36:41.080
Stop beating around the bush. Pick.
Exactly, mate.

36:41.160 --> 36:42.640
I'm gonna pick Jack.

36:42.720 --> 36:43.720
Sweet.

36:44.600 --> 36:47.360
'Sorry, Aaron.
Becca wants me up there.'

36:47.440 --> 36:49.280
So get on your bike, son,

36:49.360 --> 36:52.400
so I can get up there and bend her
over, show her what I got.

36:54.360 --> 36:56.120
Wicked. That's all good.

36:56.200 --> 36:57.480
Fuck you.

36:57.560 --> 37:00.240
That means the chat we had today
was all bullshit.

37:00.320 --> 37:03.360
You're the same girl who left.
You talk fucking shite.

37:03.440 --> 37:05.320
Becca is a fucking liar.

37:05.400 --> 37:08.200
The girl talks out of
her fucking arse.

37:08.280 --> 37:09.720
In this house, I'm single.

37:09.800 --> 37:13.960
So, bring every girl in here,
and I can do what the fuck I want.

37:14.040 --> 37:15.680
Cos you talk fucking shite.

37:15.760 --> 37:17.240
So do you. You talk shit.

37:17.320 --> 37:20.560
You're like, "I am out."
Lights out, all out. See you later.

37:20.640 --> 37:22.600
Go to the penthouse and fuck off.

37:22.680 --> 37:24.440
Fuck Zara, fuck Bec.

37:24.520 --> 37:28.160
Bring more birds in here, cos
I'm gonna literally go ballistic.

37:28.240 --> 37:31.320
I'm gonna shag everything
with a pulse, except Maisie.

37:34.840 --> 37:36.480
Oh, yes!

37:36.560 --> 37:39.880
(laughter, cheering)
That's all I care about.

37:39.960 --> 37:44.520
Joking. I do care about you being
in here, but this means a lot to me.

37:44.600 --> 37:46.160
(giggles)
This means a lot.

37:46.240 --> 37:49.520
(laughs) Howay, get it open.
You done the right pick, though.

37:49.600 --> 37:52.840
Aaron thought he had it in the bag,
but at the end of the day,

37:52.920 --> 37:54.520
I always fall on my feet.

37:54.600 --> 37:57.360
You go round in circles.
What's the point?

37:57.440 --> 38:00.800
I don't care what anyone else thinks.
But I proper like Jack.

38:00.880 --> 38:03.040
I'm not using him
to get back at Aaron.

38:03.120 --> 38:04.760
Do you want some ice?

38:04.840 --> 38:08.400
No, not in champagne.
No ice?No, thanks.

38:08.480 --> 38:10.600
Look, I'm a professional at this.

38:10.680 --> 38:12.200
Sweet, sweet.

38:12.280 --> 38:16.080
Well, then.Cheers.
Cheers to a good night.

38:16.160 --> 38:19.480
Tablet of Terror, you little beauty!

38:32.720 --> 38:36.480
Oi!(giggles)
I've gotta release it.
