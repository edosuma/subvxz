WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
We were in downtown Norfolk,

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
up on about the third
story in a restaurant.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
And we heard it and
they flooded the streets

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
and they were hollering and
dancing and carrying on.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
And we were right
there with them.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
And it was the happiest day.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
It was the happiest day.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
By the time you come out,

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
You're not like you
were when you went in.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
You've aged a whole lot.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
It was a struggle to try
to get it into your mind

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
That you were actually
back in the States.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
You just kept thinking
that you were gonna wake up

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
And find it was all a dream.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Growing up, my bedroom was
next to my parents' bedroom.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
And I can remember many a night

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
My father screaming-

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
- Screaming having a nightmare.
- Right, he did.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
And then I would hear
my mother's voice

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Trying to calm him down.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Trying to wake him
up to calm him down.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
He had a very strong will

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
So he tried to overcome

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
What was bothering him.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
But it lasted his entire life.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
- That's John Basilone.
- So who the hell is John Basilone?

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Jesus, you live in a cave?

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>The guy killed like 1000
japs on the canal.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
The president gave him a medal.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>He's a hero.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Woke up one day and
I was 30 years old-

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Satisfied. Then you walk in.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
- I reenlisted.
- I see.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
They can ship me out
whenever they want.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>Dear Vera,</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>There are things men can
do to one another</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>That are sobering to the soul.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>It is one thing to reconcile
these things with God,</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>Another to square it
with yourself.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
I don't want to look into your
eyes someday and see no spark,

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>No love, no life.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
That would break my heart.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
I told you to cease fire.
I see you with a sidearm.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
We were all sent here to
kill japs, weren't we?

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
So what the hell difference
does it make what weapon we use?

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
I'd use my goddamn
hands if I had to.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>Dropped some kind of new bomb
on the jap mainland.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Vaporized an entire city
in the blink of an eye.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Killed a lot of japs.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>Let's go, 2nd platoon. Line up.</i>

00:00.000 --> 03:00.000
<i>Let's go. Get in there tight.</i>

03:00.000 --> 03:04.107
"...and the people went their ways,
each to his own ship.

03:04.142 --> 03:07.444
Then bethought them of the
blessed boon of sleep;

03:07.478 --> 03:11.549
But Achilles still wept for
thinking of his dear comrade,

03:11.584 --> 03:15.087
And sleep, before
whom all things bow,

03:15.121 --> 03:17.322
Could take no hold upon him.

03:17.356 --> 03:19.558
<i>This way and that did he turn</i>

03:19.592 --> 03:21.693
<i>As he thought of all they
had done together,</i>

03:21.727 --> 03:24.363
<i>And all they had gone
through"-</i>

03:24.397 --> 03:27.837
Hey, you're not listening to me.

03:27.872 --> 03:30.273
Oh, no, sure we are.

03:31.575 --> 03:33.707
"... Thought of all
they had done together,

03:33.741 --> 03:36.107
And all they had gone through

03:36.142 --> 03:38.609
Both on the Fields of battle

03:39.645 --> 03:42.212
And the waves of
the weary seas. "

03:43.548 --> 03:46.082
How about a comic, Amos?

03:46.117 --> 03:49.751
I've got "snookums,
" "phantom, "Blondie. "

03:49.786 --> 03:52.487
<i>what's your favorite?</i>

03:53.589 --> 03:55.390
<i>- The japs surrendered.
- Man: What?</i>

03:55.424 --> 03:57.525
<i>- What did he say?
- The war is over.</i>

03:57.559 --> 03:59.359
<i> Did you hear that?</i>

03:59.394 --> 04:01.128
Definite. On the radio.

04:01.162 --> 04:04.197
<i>- The war's over!
- The war's over.</i>

04:04.231 --> 04:05.932
It's over.

04:05.966 --> 04:08.534
<i>It's over.</i>

04:10.270 --> 04:12.404
- Can you believe it?
- Yes!

04:16.243 --> 04:20.112
<i>It's over! It's over!</i>

04:29.821 --> 04:32.456
<i>I need a drink!</i>

04:39.631 --> 04:42.732
What do you got?
- Come on now.

04:42.766 --> 04:46.269
- Here, open wide.
- You're wasting it.

04:52.640 --> 04:57.042
You see that?
Line of stars angling up?

04:57.077 --> 04:59.744
- Yup. That's snafu's pecker.

04:59.779 --> 05:03.147
<i>hey, boys.</i>

05:04.783 --> 05:07.917
You've got a nice little party
going on down there, lieutenant.

05:07.952 --> 05:11.554
Ah. A little victory party.

05:13.122 --> 05:15.390
<i>Can't believe it's over, huh?</i>

05:17.125 --> 05:19.826
Sort of a "what do you do now?"

05:23.397 --> 05:25.163
Here

05:26.499 --> 05:30.068
Have a little v-j day
party of your own.

05:34.340 --> 05:35.740
Thanks, lieutenant.

05:42.546 --> 05:44.513
"what do we do now?"

05:46.249 --> 05:49.016
What an idiot.

05:49.050 --> 05:53.152
Well, I'll show you
what I'm doing now.

06:02.494 --> 06:04.261
Well, there it is:

06:04.295 --> 06:06.962
My first official
act of peacetime.

06:07.931 --> 06:09.331
<i>Snaf.</i>

06:53.470 --> 06:56.137
<i>Jesus. Nothing's changed.</i>

06:56.172 --> 06:58.539
<i>I thought the same thing
when I got back.</i>

06:58.573 --> 07:01.040
Funny. Here

07:02.042 --> 07:03.609
There. You can keep the change.

07:03.643 --> 07:06.277
<i>I ain't touching that.
I might've jumped into Normandy,</i>

07:06.311 --> 07:08.644
But at least I got some
liberties in London and Paris.

07:08.679 --> 07:13.714
You GI-rines, you got nothing
but jungle rot and malaria.

07:13.749 --> 07:15.749
Welcome home.

07:29.964 --> 07:32.737
<i>If you'd just given us
some warning-</i>

07:32.771 --> 07:36.342
A phone call,
a telegram or something.

07:45.751 --> 07:48.284
There. Ah.

07:48.319 --> 07:50.887
We'll get this stuff out
of here first thing.

07:50.921 --> 07:52.722
I don't know where
we're gonna put it all.

07:52.756 --> 07:54.790
<i>Well, half this junk we
can throw away.</i>

07:54.824 --> 07:57.326
That's not what you said when
we lugged it all up here.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.060
Oh, that was four years ago.

07:59.095 --> 08:01.462
I'll clear a corner and make do.

08:01.497 --> 08:05.866
Absolutely not. We will have this
place spic and span as always.

08:05.900 --> 08:09.102
This whole box can
go to the junk man.

08:14.240 --> 08:16.408
let's give him a moment.

08:54.073 --> 08:56.974
Can we have three cokes? - I could
stand for some whiskey instead of that.

08:57.008 --> 08:59.142
Coming up.

09:00.578 --> 09:02.378
<i>There you go.</i>

09:02.413 --> 09:05.581
<i>- Thanks, snaf.
- Snafu: My pleasure.</i>

09:10.386 --> 09:13.187
Hiya. I'm Merrielle Shelton.

09:13.222 --> 09:15.589
<i>How about I take you to the
back of the train</i>

09:15.624 --> 09:17.725
And you can show
me your caboose?

09:17.759 --> 09:19.994
<i>- Ouch.
- Did I tell you?</i>

09:24.598 --> 09:26.866
Feisty.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.402
Snafu just got pinked
on the train home.

09:29.436 --> 09:31.537
If we'd had been
here six months ago,

09:31.571 --> 09:33.038
That broad would've
given us all blowjobs.

09:33.072 --> 09:36.141
lied to again.

09:36.175 --> 09:37.575
This entire division didn't do

09:37.610 --> 09:39.509
That "plus six months"
horseshit we did.

09:39.543 --> 09:42.511
They got home a week after v-j
day- parades, pretty girls.

09:42.545 --> 09:44.546
1946, the party's all over.

09:44.580 --> 09:48.150
Not so much as a
complimentary beer.

09:48.184 --> 09:50.785
Somebody had to stay and
clean up after the war.

09:53.155 --> 09:55.556
I suppose I'm gonna
have to get a job too.

09:55.590 --> 09:57.691
- Doing what?
- I don't know.

09:57.726 --> 10:01.127
Anything between digging
ditches and owning a bank.

10:01.162 --> 10:03.630
nah.

10:03.664 --> 10:05.732
First I've got to
get Florence home.

10:05.766 --> 10:07.567
Wait. Florence from
Melbourne? - Mm-hmm.

10:07.601 --> 10:09.201
You're shipping her
all the way over here

10:09.236 --> 10:10.502
And this is the first
we hear about it?

10:10.537 --> 10:12.037
Come on, snaf.
That was in Okinawa.

10:12.071 --> 10:14.539
Figured it'd be bad luck
to talk about it then.

10:14.573 --> 10:16.307
- Well, when is she coming?
- I don't know.

10:16.341 --> 10:19.409
I cabled her,
but we've been at sea.

10:20.911 --> 10:22.245
I guess I'm gonna
find out soon enough

10:22.279 --> 10:24.147
Whether I'm getting
married or not.

10:24.182 --> 10:26.117
What about you, Sledgehammer

10:29.652 --> 10:32.020
I'm just hoping this Florence
girl comes to her senses.

10:33.889 --> 10:35.856
You got a job lined
up in mobile?

10:35.890 --> 10:39.158
No. No job, no girl,

10:39.193 --> 10:42.427
No plans. - How long do you
think that's gonna last?

10:42.461 --> 10:46.030
As long as the sheriff lets me.

10:49.334 --> 10:50.867
I'm gonna get that girl.

10:52.401 --> 10:55.402
- Oh, leave her alone.
- You boys watch.

10:55.436 --> 10:58.005
- I'm gonna get that girl.
- You've been saying that

10:58.039 --> 11:01.109
About every girl
since San Diego.

11:38.441 --> 11:40.575
Mrs. Basilone,

11:40.609 --> 11:43.376
I'm Lena.

11:46.113 --> 11:49.949
I recognize you from
the photos Johnny sent.

11:56.890 --> 11:58.757
Well, come in.

12:16.306 --> 12:18.106
Lena...

12:19.175 --> 12:21.142
He says you're beautiful.

12:21.176 --> 12:23.044
George.

12:24.513 --> 12:26.013
I heard so much about you.

12:26.047 --> 12:28.749
The last time I saw
him in Honolulu,

12:30.485 --> 12:32.619
He couldn't stop
talking about you.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.455
He was just about to ship out.

12:40.892 --> 12:42.993
Would you like a coffee?

12:43.027 --> 12:45.562
No. Thank you. I'm fine.

12:50.600 --> 12:52.801
Please sit down.

12:52.835 --> 12:54.936
Thank you.

13:10.653 --> 13:13.321
You have a very nice home.

13:13.355 --> 13:15.857
Thank you.

13:19.495 --> 13:21.462
The 4th marines
are mustered out.

13:21.496 --> 13:23.430
How about you?

13:23.464 --> 13:25.999
I'm waiting for orders.

13:26.033 --> 13:28.001
Hurry up and wait.

13:30.670 --> 13:33.971
Do you- do you need anything?

13:34.006 --> 13:36.674
No. No, I'm not here for-

13:36.708 --> 13:38.710
John's insurance money

13:38.745 --> 13:41.213
Is gonna help you out,
right, Lena?

13:42.282 --> 13:45.416
Actually, he never
signed the papers.

13:45.451 --> 13:49.820
<i>He never signed? That's $10,
000.</i>

13:49.855 --> 13:52.822
It's okay. I'm all right.

14:01.162 --> 14:03.696
<i>I saw his grave on Iwo.</i>

14:03.731 --> 14:07.332
He's got lots of good
marines on all sides of him.

14:10.202 --> 14:11.969
He-

14:12.004 --> 14:14.439
He would've appreciated that.

14:17.743 --> 14:19.843
Are you sure about that coffee?

14:19.877 --> 14:22.211
Maybe something stiffer?

14:23.113 --> 14:24.513
No.

14:24.547 --> 14:27.417
I came by because

14:29.521 --> 14:31.922
I thought you should have this.

15:58.521 --> 16:00.288
<i>- There's my little brother.
- Porter: Jewett!</i>

16:00.322 --> 16:02.390
<i>Jewett, Texas!</i>

16:02.424 --> 16:04.592
No sign of Florence.

16:07.395 --> 16:09.996
Melbourne's a hell of a long way, Burgie.

16:11.532 --> 16:15.167
It'll take Florence a while
to get from Australia to here.

16:23.308 --> 16:25.142
Thanks...

16:28.379 --> 16:32.381
For doing all you did to keep us
from getting our fool heads shot off.

16:35.052 --> 16:36.852
You're good marines.

17:37.766 --> 17:39.867
- It's him.
- It is?

17:39.901 --> 17:42.369
It's Robert.

17:43.704 --> 17:45.471
You made quite an entrance, Bob.

17:45.506 --> 17:48.707
the whole room is buzzing.

17:51.411 --> 17:53.646
I hope they meet
their deadlines.

17:55.682 --> 17:57.350
We're all mighty proud of you,

17:57.384 --> 17:59.085
Proud of all you soldiers.

18:00.154 --> 18:01.955
I was a marine.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.259
We're proud of all of you.

18:07.728 --> 18:09.896
So now you're back.

18:09.930 --> 18:11.964
I'm guessing you're
here for a job.

18:11.998 --> 18:14.032
That's why they
made you the editor.

18:14.066 --> 18:15.733
I'll take my former position.

18:15.768 --> 18:17.764
Well, you still want
to cover local sports?

18:17.798 --> 18:20.033
Yup... To start with.

18:20.968 --> 18:23.069
Here's why:

18:24.371 --> 18:26.404
That guy you've got writing
the column right now-

18:26.439 --> 18:28.372
He's got no snap, no style.

18:28.407 --> 18:31.375
The prose just lays there
like spilled ink on newsprint.

18:31.409 --> 18:33.744
You need to send him to
obits and give me his desk.

18:34.879 --> 18:37.714
I do
- For the sake of the paper.

18:37.748 --> 18:41.321
Dan, when did you see me demoting him
and hiring you?

18:41.355 --> 18:43.793
- Today is good.
- Today?

18:43.827 --> 18:46.228
Bergen catholic plays don
Bosco prep this afternoon.

18:46.263 --> 18:48.697
The kickoff is at 3:00, so...

18:50.166 --> 18:53.134
I'd better get going.

18:53.168 --> 18:56.237
Shouldn't we talk about salary?

18:56.271 --> 18:58.672
$10 a week raise will do it.

18:58.706 --> 19:02.041
- I will give you $7.
- I'd have taken $5.

20:06.660 --> 20:08.461
What are you looking at?

20:09.663 --> 20:11.063
Are you a jap?

20:11.097 --> 20:13.999
Honestly, 'cause you
sneak up like one.

20:22.274 --> 20:25.275
You are spying on Vera Keller.

20:25.309 --> 20:27.343
- My God.
- Ma.

20:27.378 --> 20:30.112
She never gave you
the time of day.

20:31.214 --> 20:33.349
And she's dating an officer,
of course.

20:33.383 --> 20:36.151
<i>look at that fancy car.</i>

20:36.185 --> 20:37.752
Did you come up
here for a reason?

20:37.786 --> 20:40.521
To get you to stop banging
on that typewriter.

20:40.555 --> 20:42.022
It's called working, ma.

20:42.056 --> 20:44.090
Not sitting there like that,
it isn't.

20:51.631 --> 20:53.665
look at this mess.

21:01.806 --> 21:04.674
Mmm, your dress blues.

21:07.344 --> 21:09.377
<i>You've never even worn them.</i>

21:22.322 --> 21:24.924
I think you would've
looked nice in them.

21:45.445 --> 21:48.147
<i>New Orleans Crescent city,</i>

21:48.181 --> 21:50.716
<i>Home to the delta blues and
the French quarter.</i>

21:50.750 --> 21:53.552
<i>Watch your wallets,
pockets and watches.</i>

21:53.586 --> 21:55.753
<i>This is new Orleans.</i>

22:19.975 --> 22:21.643
<i>Hot links!</i>

22:21.677 --> 22:24.145
<i>Get your hot links here!</i>

22:24.179 --> 22:26.113
<i>Hey, how about a hot link?</i>

22:56.109 --> 22:59.445
- Yes?
- Mrs. Keller.

22:59.480 --> 23:01.347
Yes.

23:01.382 --> 23:03.516
I'd like to speak to Vera,
please.

23:03.550 --> 23:05.552
And who shall I say is calling?

23:05.586 --> 23:07.520
Robert Leckie, Mrs. Keller.

23:07.554 --> 23:10.990
I've lived across the street
from you for the last 20 years.

23:12.392 --> 23:14.592
Of course.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.427
Welcome home, Robert.

23:16.461 --> 23:19.329
Let me just see if she
can come to the door.

23:36.340 --> 23:38.474
Bob Leckie.

23:39.543 --> 23:41.176
You're back.

23:41.211 --> 23:43.878
I was afraid you wouldn't
remember me either.

23:43.912 --> 23:46.713
Oh, I remember you.
The last time I saw you was

23:46.747 --> 23:49.048
In church right before
you shipped out.

23:49.082 --> 23:51.017
So...

23:51.051 --> 23:53.219
You look well.

23:53.253 --> 23:56.055
Nice uniform.

23:56.089 --> 23:58.491
thank you.

24:02.663 --> 24:04.398
I've been wondering
if you would grant me

24:04.433 --> 24:06.501
The pleasure of taking you out.

24:06.535 --> 24:08.335
You want to take me out?

24:08.370 --> 24:11.104
Yes, I do.

24:12.006 --> 24:13.870
Uh, I have a date tonight.

24:13.904 --> 24:16.864
<i>when the doorbell rang,
I thought you were him.</i>

24:19.961 --> 24:22.827
<i>Well, there he is.</i>

24:28.166 --> 24:30.100
Nice car.

24:38.508 --> 24:41.676
Hey. Robert Leckie.

24:41.710 --> 24:43.144
Charles Dunworthy.

24:43.178 --> 24:45.446
Vera. - Mmm. Army, huh, Charlie?

24:45.480 --> 24:47.047
Where'd you serve?

24:47.082 --> 24:49.182
I just graduated
from West point.

24:49.217 --> 24:51.785
Lieutenant. Congratulations.

24:52.887 --> 24:55.254
Too bad you missed
the whole show.

24:56.956 --> 24:58.791
Vera...

25:00.093 --> 25:02.561
How about another time?

25:02.596 --> 25:04.563
Maybe tomorrow night?

25:04.597 --> 25:06.398
What's going on here?

25:06.433 --> 25:08.368
I just asked Vera if she'd
like to have dinner.

25:08.402 --> 25:10.503
Huh. Nice try.

25:10.537 --> 25:12.238
She's not interested.

25:16.009 --> 25:18.944
Actually, I don't have any
plans for tomorrow night.

25:20.313 --> 25:23.681
Oh, is that right? Really?

25:27.485 --> 25:30.220
<i>Obviously I've been wasting
a lot of gasoline.</i>

25:32.655 --> 25:34.956
Good night, Vera.

25:40.227 --> 25:43.262
Well, it looks like I am
free for dinner tonight.

25:51.701 --> 25:54.002
So what are you gonna
do now that you're home?

25:54.036 --> 25:57.572
Oh, I'm back writing for
"the Bergen county record. "

25:57.607 --> 26:00.142
Oh, we don't get "the record. "

26:01.845 --> 26:03.913
I'll talk to subscriptions.

26:11.823 --> 26:14.157
you're staring.

26:14.191 --> 26:16.158
Oh. I'm sorry.

26:19.828 --> 26:21.495
No.

26:21.529 --> 26:24.496
Actually, I'm not.

26:26.132 --> 26:28.965
Three years ago in a miserable
part of the pacific,

26:29.000 --> 26:31.200
I was laying in the mud,

26:31.235 --> 26:33.535
Dreaming about a moment
like this with you.

26:36.771 --> 26:39.539
You get right to it, don't you?

26:42.142 --> 26:43.941
In the mud?

26:45.844 --> 26:47.344
Afraid so.

26:48.346 --> 26:50.813
You must've been through a lot.

26:57.812 --> 26:59.409
Well, here we are.

26:59.444 --> 27:01.905
- Mm-hmm.
- So what's next?

27:01.939 --> 27:04.073
I don't know.
I didn't get that far.

27:05.408 --> 27:07.342
And why me?

27:07.377 --> 27:11.445
Why not Rita Hayworth
or Betty Grable?

27:12.947 --> 27:14.781
Because I know you.

27:14.816 --> 27:16.783
Bob, you don't-

27:18.686 --> 27:21.123
You don't really know me.

27:22.059 --> 27:23.726
You're right.

27:24.695 --> 27:25.961
Yeah.

27:25.996 --> 27:27.596
I think- I don't-

27:27.631 --> 27:29.465
I don't know how to do this.

27:29.499 --> 27:32.168
<i>Bob, you're doing fine.
This is fine.</i>

27:33.804 --> 27:36.305
It's a start.

27:45.747 --> 27:48.315
You know, I wrote you a lot of
letters while I was over there.

27:48.349 --> 27:51.750
You did? I didn't get any.

27:51.784 --> 27:54.185
- I never sent 'em.
- Why?

27:56.221 --> 27:58.021
I thought-

28:00.557 --> 28:02.258
I didn't think I
was gonna make it,

28:02.292 --> 28:04.561
So it didn't matter
if I sent 'em or not.

28:08.098 --> 28:10.099
Can I read them now?

28:10.133 --> 28:11.633
I don't have 'em anymore.

28:11.668 --> 28:14.441
Rain on cape Gloucester
erased every word.

28:16.653 --> 28:19.525
What were they like,
these letters?

28:21.629 --> 28:23.931
Best stuff I ever wrote.

28:52.856 --> 28:54.890
Hey, buddy.
I appreciate you coming.

28:54.924 --> 28:56.592
<i>Thanks so much for
picking me up.</i>

29:03.230 --> 29:05.464
- Hi, fella. How are you?
- Good to see you.

29:09.001 --> 29:11.802
You gonna take this
for me or what?

29:13.638 --> 29:15.772
Good to see you, Eugene.

29:15.806 --> 29:18.574
We'll just drive
up to Chickasaw.

29:18.608 --> 29:20.675
So good to see you.

29:25.846 --> 29:28.148
What's with the Macarthur bit?

29:28.182 --> 29:29.716
<i>- Huh?
- The mammy yokum.</i>

29:29.750 --> 29:32.051
Popeye the sailor.

29:34.321 --> 29:36.121
It calms me down.

29:36.155 --> 29:38.289
<i>Packing it, cleaning it-</i>

29:38.324 --> 29:40.424
I always have something to do.

29:42.827 --> 29:44.995
What do you remember
about Mary Houston?

29:46.631 --> 29:48.564
- Mary Houston?
- Yeah.

29:48.599 --> 29:50.632
<i>The Mary Houston?</i>

29:50.667 --> 29:52.767
Well, like everybody
else in mobile,

29:52.801 --> 29:55.635
- I was in love with Mary Houston.
- That's too bad for you.

29:55.670 --> 29:58.004
- She's marrying me.
- Yeah, sure she will-

29:58.038 --> 30:00.738
<i>- The minute she goes blind.
- Well, I asked her.</i>

30:00.773 --> 30:04.341
She said yes, so you're just gonna
have to deal with it, brother.

30:06.544 --> 30:08.611
<i>You're saying that Mary Houston</i>

30:08.645 --> 30:10.846
Is gonna be Mary
Houston Phillips?

30:10.881 --> 30:13.249
In the eyes of God and the law.

30:14.851 --> 30:16.819
Well, what am I gonna hear next?

30:16.853 --> 30:19.388
That Martians landed downtown?
They're setting up a hotel?

30:19.422 --> 30:21.991
I want you to be my best man.

30:24.227 --> 30:26.996
If you think that I'm
gonna stand at the altar

30:27.030 --> 30:29.097
And lose Mary Houston
to the likes of you-

30:33.669 --> 30:36.536
- Well, hell yes!
- Come on, Eugene!

30:36.571 --> 30:38.538
Hey, come on!

30:52.220 --> 30:54.354
Right here is fine, Sid.

30:56.295 --> 30:58.234
Are you sure this is good?

31:00.810 --> 31:02.744
Yup.

31:19.393 --> 31:21.293
See you later.

31:22.328 --> 31:24.096
Welcome home, Eugene.

33:46.912 --> 33:48.913
Oh!

33:54.619 --> 33:56.686
Hand me your plate
right there, will you?

33:56.720 --> 34:00.122
<i>- Yes, give him a big slice.
- A nice big slice.</i>

34:00.157 --> 34:02.958
<i>How many would you like?</i>

34:02.992 --> 34:04.592
Thank you.

34:04.627 --> 34:06.361
Honey, would you like some corn?

34:06.395 --> 34:09.029
- Yes, thank you.
- I'll get you some corn.

34:12.433 --> 34:15.668
I can help you set.
Eat up, sweetheart.

34:15.703 --> 34:17.603
Now are you sure you
don't want anymore?

34:17.638 --> 34:20.940
<i>Dr. Sledge: We should have a little
toast. - Oh, that's lovely, yes.</i>

34:20.974 --> 34:22.475
To Edward's new wife
and the boys being he.

34:22.509 --> 34:26.045
Here's a little souvenir that
I brought back from Prague.

34:26.079 --> 34:29.582
- My lord.
- Edward, it's extraordinary.

34:29.616 --> 34:32.284
<i>It was floating along the
ground in this forest</i>

34:32.319 --> 34:34.420
<i>That me and my buddy Jack
were sitting in.</i>

34:34.454 --> 34:36.556
<i>I ran over and I
picked it up...</i>

34:55.239 --> 34:57.440
<i>Stop! No!</i>

35:57.275 --> 36:00.343
<i>I didn't get any sleep for
the longest time.</i>

36:01.378 --> 36:03.479
I still can't, really.

36:05.115 --> 36:07.115
I toss and turn like crazy.

36:08.550 --> 36:10.651
Martha doesn't complain,

36:10.685 --> 36:13.420
But I know I keep waking her up.

36:20.127 --> 36:22.094
Give me your coffee.

36:36.206 --> 36:38.441
I like Martha.

36:40.777 --> 36:42.344
<i>You're a lucky man.</i>

36:42.378 --> 36:44.345
You'll be married...

36:44.380 --> 36:46.180
Someday.

36:49.885 --> 36:54.120
And just how did my little brother
do during his time in the service?

36:55.856 --> 36:58.457
There weren't any women in
my corner of the pacific.

37:00.126 --> 37:02.227
Only nurses and they
were off-limits.

37:02.261 --> 37:05.163
Jesus h. You went
through the entire war

37:05.197 --> 37:06.997
And retained your virginity?

37:08.499 --> 37:10.599
Well, your lonely nights
are numbered, gene.

37:10.634 --> 37:14.036
Every single girl in mobile
is out to land a fighting man.

37:14.070 --> 37:15.838
At the o. O.M. Ball,

37:15.872 --> 37:18.473
You'll have a leg up on
all those desk pilots.

37:18.507 --> 37:20.241
Who says I want a
leg up on anybody?

37:20.275 --> 37:23.411
You show up at that ball
decked out in your uniform

37:23.445 --> 37:27.748
And all the ripe fruit will fall
off the tree right at your feet.

37:27.783 --> 37:29.583
You know, Edward,
I don't believe I will.

37:31.119 --> 37:33.019
You're gonna pass on the o.
O.M. Ball?

37:33.054 --> 37:37.557
No. I don't believe I will
ever put on a uniform again.

37:42.261 --> 37:44.029
Ever.

38:05.381 --> 38:07.915
registration? You.

38:10.418 --> 38:12.186
<i>That's right, 'cause if
you don't do it,</i>

38:12.220 --> 38:14.554
<i>They're gonna make you get
back in line again.</i>

38:14.589 --> 38:16.522
Service number right here.

38:24.228 --> 38:25.962
If you could just
head up back there,

38:25.996 --> 38:28.463
That'd be great. Thank you.

38:28.497 --> 38:33.200
You're looking to register
for classes, Mr. Sledge?

38:33.234 --> 38:35.401
- I'm thinking about it.
- Good choice.

38:35.435 --> 38:37.936
Alabama polytechnic is the best.

38:37.970 --> 38:40.104
Which branch did you serve in?

38:40.139 --> 38:42.239
I was in the marine corps, miss.

38:43.174 --> 38:45.775
"U.S.M.C."

38:45.809 --> 38:49.211
And did you attend any special
schools while in the marine corps?

38:50.879 --> 38:52.346
Just boot camp.

38:52.381 --> 38:54.248
Weapons school.

38:55.283 --> 38:56.816
I was in a mortar squad.

38:56.850 --> 38:59.952
Okay. Did you do
any accounting?

38:59.986 --> 39:01.587
No, miss.

39:01.621 --> 39:04.122
Any journalism?

39:04.156 --> 39:05.923
None at all.

39:05.957 --> 39:07.958
Any engineering,
technical skills?

39:07.992 --> 39:10.293
I had to handle explosives.

39:10.327 --> 39:12.494
Okay.

39:14.597 --> 39:17.031
Isn't there anything the
marine corps taught you

39:17.065 --> 39:19.299
That you can continue
at 'bama poly?

39:24.004 --> 39:26.705
They taught me how to kill japs.

39:28.374 --> 39:30.841
I got pretty damn good at it.

39:45.668 --> 39:49.175
- Oh, I just love this song.
- I know.

40:04.156 --> 40:06.490
Uh, excuse me.

40:43.889 --> 40:46.890
<i>I saw you making a
break for it.</i>

40:46.925 --> 40:51.127
<i>I thought you could use a
punch properly spiked.</i>

40:51.162 --> 40:53.096
Thank you.

40:53.131 --> 40:56.266
Drink fast. If Mary catches us,

40:56.300 --> 40:58.735
She'll have me back
inside dancing all night.

40:58.769 --> 41:00.537
you see that?

41:00.571 --> 41:02.105
That's why I'm still a bachelor.

41:02.139 --> 41:06.108
I don't dance until Eugene
sledge wants to dance.

41:13.783 --> 41:16.151
How did all this happen?

41:17.486 --> 41:19.620
I mean look at us, Sid,

41:21.657 --> 41:23.858
Sitting here at a dance,
drinking punch.

41:23.892 --> 41:26.360
Not a scratch on either of us.

41:27.963 --> 41:30.665
I mean what the hell
are we doing here?

41:32.901 --> 41:35.934
And why- why did
I end up back here

41:35.969 --> 41:38.102
When all those other
fellas didn't?

41:40.572 --> 41:42.673
I thought that.

41:43.674 --> 41:46.342
Every guy back has thought that.

41:50.780 --> 41:53.214
But you've just got to pull
yourself out of bed in the morning

41:53.248 --> 41:54.948
And get on with the day.

41:56.683 --> 41:58.717
You do that enough
times in a row,

41:58.751 --> 42:01.786
You forget some things.

42:04.455 --> 42:06.689
For a while, anyway.

42:09.625 --> 42:12.760
- Sidney Phillips.
- Yeah.

42:12.794 --> 42:16.429
Will you get back in here and dance
with the woman who loves you?

42:16.463 --> 42:18.231
I'm coming, boss lady.

42:18.265 --> 42:21.400
Why don't you come on in?
I'll wrangle you a partner.

42:22.335 --> 42:24.002
No.

42:25.304 --> 42:26.838
No.

42:51.965 --> 42:53.666
Look at these televisions.

42:53.700 --> 42:57.136
There isn't but two
hours of programs

42:57.170 --> 42:59.805
And they're asking $300 a set.

42:59.840 --> 43:01.340
Sounds like the future to me.

43:01.375 --> 43:02.775
I'm gonna run down to
Murphy's and buy one

43:02.809 --> 43:04.310
As soon as I have the
money for a down payment.

43:04.344 --> 43:05.544
On a reporter's salary?

43:05.579 --> 43:07.146
<i>And how about this
railroad strike?</i>

43:07.180 --> 43:09.280
<i>It's crippled traffic
across the country.</i>

43:09.315 --> 43:12.215
<i>Room on the table, please.</i>

43:12.250 --> 43:15.284
- Well, how do they work?
- Is that creamed spinach?

43:15.319 --> 43:16.786
The waves are collected
by a receiver,

43:16.820 --> 43:18.954
Shot through an electron
gun onto a vacuum screen.

43:18.988 --> 43:21.121
Always with the answers.

43:21.155 --> 43:23.554
It's called a cathode Ray tube.

43:23.589 --> 43:25.722
<i>Those things heat up,
you know... - Thank you.</i>

43:25.757 --> 43:28.391
<i>- ... Catch on fire. - John: So you
think you're going down</i>

43:28.425 --> 43:30.525
To Murphy's to get
yourself a television set?

43:30.559 --> 43:32.926
Well, there aren't any.
Nothing's being delivered.

43:32.961 --> 43:34.894
Why creamed spinach?

43:34.929 --> 43:37.097
<i> I think the army should
take over the railroads.</i>

43:37.131 --> 43:39.099
That'll teach 'em. Right, Bob?

43:39.133 --> 43:41.968
You know they transmit from the
top of the empire state building?

43:42.002 --> 43:45.003
I bet in five years
everyone's gonna want one.

43:45.038 --> 43:47.471
Steel workers and electrical
workers are also on strike.

43:47.506 --> 43:50.240
Who's next? We just won the war

43:50.274 --> 43:52.139
And now they're
holding us hostage.

43:52.173 --> 43:54.737
We didn't fight for a
bunch of greedy strikers.

43:54.771 --> 43:58.643
<i>What did we fight for? I thought it was
to beat the japs and the Nazis.</i>

43:58.678 --> 44:01.748
I'm just saying the country
won't survive these strikes.

44:01.782 --> 44:04.284
Too bad we didn't lose the war. Then
the japs would have all these problems.

44:04.318 --> 44:07.553
<i>- Very funny.
- Man: Bob, we all appreciate</i>

44:07.588 --> 44:10.289
The sacrifice you
made on our account.

44:10.324 --> 44:12.191
You know what I fought for?

44:17.196 --> 44:18.897
Television.

44:22.201 --> 44:25.036
Foddy, ask the blessings,
please.

44:26.238 --> 44:29.039
our father

44:29.073 --> 44:32.809
Who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

44:32.843 --> 44:36.011
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

44:36.046 --> 44:38.046
On earth as it is in heaven.

44:39.249 --> 44:41.349
<i>Give us this day our
daily bread</i>

44:41.384 --> 44:43.584
And forgive us our trespasses

44:43.618 --> 44:45.284
As we forgive those that
trespass against us.

44:45.319 --> 44:49.217
<i>Lead us not into temptation</i>

44:49.252 --> 44:52.119
<i>But deliver us from evil.</i>

44:52.153 --> 44:54.052
- Amen.
- Amen.

44:54.086 --> 44:56.752
- Amen.
- Amen.

44:57.687 --> 44:59.854
Amen.

45:43.793 --> 45:47.794
I thought we'd start at what's left
of that old fence down by the creek.

46:06.948 --> 46:10.384
I've been looking forward to
this morning for a long time.

46:11.487 --> 46:13.755
Just the two of us
and a grand morning.

46:30.335 --> 46:31.701
Eugene?

46:40.274 --> 46:42.174
I'm sorry.

46:45.178 --> 46:46.944
I can't.

46:46.979 --> 46:49.246
It's all right.

46:55.150 --> 46:57.851
You don't have to
apologize to me, Eugene.

47:06.325 --> 47:09.460
I reckon the dove population is
gonna be mighty happy this morning.

47:30.550 --> 47:32.584
Honestly, Eugene,

47:32.619 --> 47:35.253
You look like a gangster
with those glasses on.

47:41.558 --> 47:43.591
Your brother's coming
for supper this evening.

47:43.626 --> 47:47.262
Evidently, he's been named some
kind of supervisor at the bank.

47:49.364 --> 47:51.803
Better get our money
out of that bank.

47:55.175 --> 47:57.041
I'm sure Edward could arrange

47:57.076 --> 47:58.876
A starting position for you

47:58.910 --> 48:01.244
<i>At the bank.</i>

48:01.279 --> 48:03.779
I'm never going to
work in a bank, mother.

48:06.482 --> 48:09.250
Well, you need to make

48:09.285 --> 48:11.252
A plan for the future.

48:12.554 --> 48:14.855
My plan is to
nothing for a while.

48:16.023 --> 48:17.890
<i>How long is "a while," Eugene?</i>

48:17.924 --> 48:20.759
Leave him alone, Mary Frank.

48:23.428 --> 48:25.529
The boy is idle, Edward.

48:25.564 --> 48:28.699
- He is not a boy.
- Well, he's acting like one.

48:30.435 --> 48:32.569
Mary Frank, you have no idea

48:32.603 --> 48:35.071
What men like him
have been through.

48:37.341 --> 48:40.075
Now go on. Let him be.
