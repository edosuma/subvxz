<i>I want to know everything.</i>

02:26.438 --> 02:27.731
Hey, tiger.

02:33.362 --> 02:35.155
You fell asleep with the TV on.

02:36.073 --> 02:41.912
Grandma was reading me a story.
The one with the flying elephants.

02:43.747 --> 02:48.001
But... they can never really fly.

02:50.629 --> 02:51.672
Can they?

02:53.423 --> 02:56.593
No, sweetie, they had trunks, not wings.

02:57.594 --> 02:59.638
You know that. I showed you pictures.

03:01.765 --> 03:03.100
Come on, amigo. Let's go.

03:34.798 --> 03:36.884

03:42.806 --> 03:45.350
<i>That reminds me of you,

03:46.059 --> 03:48.562
I saw there was another beaching event.

03:48.562 --> 03:52.107
Three individuals at Farewell Spit.
Do you have any thoughts on why?

03:52.608 --> 03:54.526
<i>Why would a healthy,</i>

03:54.526 --> 03:58.363

one life just because the world's a mess?</i>

03:58.864 --> 04:01.742
- <i>I don't know. You tell me.</i>
- Okay, Marco.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.452
Maybe calling you was not a good idea.

04:03.452 --> 04:06.079
<i>Okay. You work for the competition, Bec.</i>

04:06.079 --> 04:08.207
<i>Technically, that's corporate

All the more reason to share information.

04:28.644 --> 04:30.896
<i>If I had one I was working on,
I'd let you know.</i>

04:31.522 --> 04:32.940
<i>I'm sure you'd do the same for me.</i>

04:35.901 --> 04:38.570
<i>You would, wouldn't you?</i>

04:40.864 --> 04:41.907
I had one.

04:44.535 --> 04:48.830
Just last week. And then she went silent.

04:48.830 --> 04:52.042
Just nothing for days. Now I've lost her.

04:54.253 --> 04:56.171
Ocean temp is over 90 most days.

04:56.171 --> 05:00.217
Krill is gone, almost.

05:00.217 --> 05:03.846
It's just, food column is collapsing.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.350
If she doesn't come back,
they're gonna shut us down.

05:09.226 --> 05:11.645
<i>Well, fingers crossed, Bec.
I hope she comes back.</i>

05:13.480 --> 05:15.941

08:15.078 --> 08:17.331
And you know what kind

08:17.331 --> 08:18.665
Yeah, orange.

So, no more than 15 minutes outside.

08:22.085 --> 08:24.880
With the fire still burning,
the air quality isn't that good.

- You should be careful, Ezra.

09:20.143 --> 09:22.020
Yeah, liar. Red means dead.

But, you know,

09:45.210 --> 09:47.838
we seem to have lost contact

09:47.838 --> 09:50.799

09:51.884 --> 09:54.386

11:24.393 --> 11:27.437
You asked me last time about my mother.

11:29.106 --> 11:31.567
Her name was Eve.

11:34.820 --> 11:37.865
I hear her voice when I speak to you.

11:39.825 --> 11:41.785
That's what you sound like to me.

11:43.745 --> 11:46.582
An older woman who liked
to sit in a rowboat

11:46.582 --> 11:51.128
on a lake in the Berkshires
and drink bourbon at sunset.

11:53.922 --> 11:56.800
Not that you know what any of that means.

12:05.893 --> 12:09.271
She used to say
that whenever I felt sad or lonely,

12:09.271 --> 12:13.775
I could just imagine
Gustav Mahler communicating

12:13.775 --> 12:16.945
with me from another time.

12:20.157 --> 12:23.035
Mahler's heart was breaking
when he wrote this.

12:26.246 --> 12:30.584
His daughter had died
the year before of scarlet fever.

12:34.838 --> 12:37.382
This is how life made him sound.

12:42.554 --> 12:45.516
Mahler died before
he ever heard it actually played.

12:47.392 --> 12:48.936
Wasn't even finished.

12:50.604 --> 12:53.649
My mother used to tell me

12:53.649 --> 12:56.860
to finish it in my head.

13:01.990 --> 13:03.867
I really want you to come back.

13:08.580 --> 13:09.706
Shit.

13:23.345 --> 13:26.265
<i>Summer of '37, there were all those fires.</i>

<i>Something like 30 EHDs

13:34.565 --> 13:38.402
Tried to stay out of the heat.
Electricity kept going out, so...

13:40.279 --> 13:42.364
Does he understand
the severity of his condition?

13:42.948 --> 13:44.283
Have you told him?

13:44.283 --> 13:47.286
Does he understand
he could die from a sunny day?

13:48.745 --> 13:50.873
No, I haven't quite found
the words for that.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.587
He knows he has summer heart.

13:56.587 --> 13:59.506
He knows what an EHD is
and that he has to avoid them.

14:01.091 --> 14:04.261
He calls them "empty heart days"
instead of "extreme heat,"

14:04.261 --> 14:07.723
so, yeah, he understands
that he needs to be careful.

14:08.891 --> 14:12.060
Is that what happened?
Did he spend too much time outside?

14:12.060 --> 14:14.062
No, he wasn't outside.

14:14.980 --> 14:17.941
Evidently, some older boys
were teasing him about something,

14:17.941 --> 14:19.693
and that got him worked up.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.069
Triggered the event.

14:24.448 --> 14:26.658
There was a little girl
with him when I got there.

14:28.577 --> 14:30.245
She has summer heart as well.

14:35.334 --> 14:38.504

and then he gave it to me?

14:54.811 --> 14:55.896
No, sweetie.

14:56.396 --> 14:59.691
Your dad was born in 1999,
and nobody had summer heart then.

15:00.275 --> 15:02.819
Your dad gave you a great, big heart.

15:04.446 --> 15:05.531
And that great, big heart

15:05.531 --> 15:07.824
is why he was in Manila
when the storm came.

15:11.703 --> 15:15.999
The world made you sick
because we made the world sick.

15:17.209 --> 15:19.336
But now we're gonna make you better.

15:25.050 --> 15:27.010
There's a girl at school who said

15:27.010 --> 15:29.930
that people with summer heart
only live to be 30.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.766
So, since I'll be turning ten next year,

15:33.517 --> 15:37.104
that means I'll only
get two more ten-year lives.

15:37.104 --> 15:39.356
Well, I don't believe that.

15:39.356 --> 15:42.276
I believe you will have
many more ten-year lives.

15:43.861 --> 15:48.365
Maybe you're like a cat.
You'll have nine lives.

15:48.365 --> 15:50.158
- That's 90.
- Right.

15:50.993 --> 15:52.536
And I bet by the time you're 30,

15:52.536 --> 15:56.123
someone will have invented
an entirely new heart just for you.

18:54.885 --> 18:56.553
I want to learn from you.

19:00.265 --> 19:03.685
<i>You have been watching.
You know how we are.</i>

19:05.687 --> 19:07.648
Could you tell me what you're looking for?

19:10.108 --> 19:14.029
<i>We, who are us, share the world.</i>

19:15.364 --> 19:17.032
<i>All that is there.</i>

19:18.700 --> 19:22.663
<i>When it becomes less, so do we.</i>

19:26.083 --> 19:27.584
<i>Is it like that for you?</i>

19:32.422 --> 19:38.428
<i>Our new ones do not rise
and fall on the breath.</i>

19:40.681 --> 19:44.893
<i>They leave us for the distance.</i>

19:48.897 --> 19:52.943
<i>We watch them vanish.</i>

19:55.654 --> 19:58.866
<i>All of mine have gone that way.</i>

19:58.866 --> 20:00.742
I will look for food for you.

20:04.997 --> 20:08.458
<i>I need to find him. He knows--</i>

20:12.963 --> 20:14.631
Add to vocabulary interface.

20:22.598 --> 20:26.185
<i>If she doesn't find something to eat,
we could lose her again. And the male.</i>

20:26.185 --> 20:28.270
What if we offer her food to keep going?

20:28.270 --> 20:31.481
<i>Adult humpbacks require 3,000 pounds
of food a day.</i>

20:31.481 --> 20:34.109
- <i>Mainly krill, but--</i>
- I didn't know.

20:34.109 --> 20:38.697
Yeah, that obviously has ramifications
we would need to talk about internally.

20:38.697 --> 20:40.407
<i>Well, the good news is she wants to mate,</i>

20:40.407 --> 20:42.367
<i>which is part of her migratory cycle,</i>

20:42.367 --> 20:45.162
<i>so we could have a real window
into that behavior if the male is,</i>

20:45.913 --> 20:46.914
<i>you know, strong enough.</i>

20:46.914 --> 20:50.459
She's gonna be the prototype
for every humpback we ever develop.

20:50.459 --> 20:52.377
- Great work today, Becca.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

20:58.467 --> 20:59.635
Food?

21:00.135 --> 21:01.637
- That's a tricky one.
- Yeah?

21:01.637 --> 21:04.681
I mean, it's not a good look
to take quality protein

21:04.681 --> 21:06.308
and offer it to animals.

21:07.267 --> 21:08.602
There's a damn drought in Asia.

21:08.602 --> 21:10.020
People are dying there,

21:10.854 --> 21:14.107
and we're gonna feed
a whale human-quality nutrients

21:14.107 --> 21:16.860
to get it to chat about eating
and fucking.

21:17.903 --> 21:18.987
It's a PR nightmare.

21:18.987 --> 21:20.739
Okay, okay. That's fair enough.

21:21.740 --> 21:23.867
The surface temperature is up.
Acidification is up.

21:23.867 --> 21:25.869
The bay is destined to become a dead zone.

21:26.745 --> 21:29.081
It's likely to be the last season here.

21:29.957 --> 21:32.459
We just need to move this along.

21:32.960 --> 21:35.128
Wrap it up by end of week
before everything comes out.

21:35.128 --> 21:36.672
Agreed.

21:36.672 --> 21:40.592
Exclusivity of a humpback knocks
TomorrowZoo out of the game.

21:40.592 --> 21:42.427
Just give me a couple more nights.

21:50.102 --> 21:52.771
<i>"'We are roses,' the roses said.</i>

21:52.771 --> 21:57.526
<i>And he was overcome with sadness
'cause his flower had told him</i>

21:58.026 --> 22:01.697
<i>that she was the only one
of her kind in the universe.</i>

22:02.406 --> 22:05.701
<i>And here were 5,000 of them,</i>

22:06.201 --> 22:09.162
<i>all alike, in one single garden.</i>

22:09.913 --> 22:13.500
<i>'She would be very much annoyed,'
he said to himself,</i>

22:13.500 --> 22:15.711
<i>'if she should see that.</i>

22:15.711 --> 22:18.046
<i>She would cough most dreadfully,</i>

22:18.046 --> 22:22.426
<i>and she would pretend that she was dying
to avoid being laughed at.</i>

22:23.177 --> 22:24.469
<i>And if I--</i>

22:24.469 --> 22:26.680
<i>And I would be obliged to pretend</i>

22:26.680 --> 22:29.349
<i>that I was nursing her back to life.</i>

22:30.058 --> 22:33.729
For if I did not do that

22:35.147 --> 22:37.482
to humble myself also,

22:38.442 --> 22:41.945
she would really allow herself to die.'"

22:45.490 --> 22:47.784
- You want me to read for a while, Mom?
- No, no, no.

22:47.784 --> 22:52.664
I'm-- You're going to be here.

22:53.165 --> 22:58.086
I'm not. So, this is Grandma time.

23:01.632 --> 23:05.677
<i>"So, then he went on with his reflections.</i>

23:06.678 --> 23:09.932
- <i>'I thought that I was rich with a flower...</i>
- You like that one, don't you?

23:09.932 --> 23:11.975
<i>...that was unique in all the world'"--</i>

23:11.975 --> 23:15.604
Does the whale you're talking to
sound like the way the orangutan did?

23:16.522 --> 23:19.233
No, I made the orangutan
sound like your father

23:19.233 --> 23:21.026
because I missed him.

23:21.026 --> 23:23.320
Then what does the whale sound like?

23:23.946 --> 23:25.197
Like Grandma Eve.

23:26.031 --> 23:28.742
No, but what does she
sound like in real life?

23:29.826 --> 23:30.953
Wanna hear?

23:32.538 --> 23:36.834
Play HW1998. Basic vocabulary.

23:47.135 --> 23:48.554
What is she saying?

23:49.096 --> 23:54.309
She's saying,
"Who is this little human, Ezra,

23:54.309 --> 23:57.771
who I love so much?"

24:04.236 --> 24:08.323
When I'm gone,
will you make an animal sound like me?

24:09.533 --> 24:12.995
No, baby.
Because you're not going extinct.

24:17.958 --> 24:20.752
<i>"'And all I had was a common little rose.'</i>

24:20.752 --> 24:24.882
<i>You wanna see, Ezra? You wanna see roses?</i>

24:26.884 --> 24:29.052
<i>'A common rose,' he said."</i>

24:30.179 --> 24:32.598
<i>I'm Nick Bilton,
and many of you may have heard</i>

24:32.598 --> 24:34.183
<i>that I'm interested in joining forces</i>

24:34.183 --> 24:38.896
<i>with the most sophisticated DNA-based
IP company in the world,</i>

24:38.896 --> 24:41.690
<i>Menagerie2100.</i>

24:41.690 --> 24:44.902
<i>Now, you might ask why a company</i>

24:44.902 --> 24:46.904
<i>like Alpha wants to be in this space,</i>

24:46.904 --> 24:49.239
<i>and the answer is easy.</i>

24:49.239 --> 24:52.409
<i>Alpha is interested in only one thing:</i>

24:52.409 --> 24:56.747
<i>identifying what about
the present belongs in the future.</i>

24:57.414 --> 24:58.624
<i>A better future.</i>

24:59.124 --> 25:02.920
<i>A future with genetically
banked elephants, orangutans and,</i>

25:04.046 --> 25:07.341
<i>from what I hear,
maybe even humpback whales.</i>

25:07.841 --> 25:11.053
The Alpha benefits package is outstanding.

25:11.053 --> 25:13.138
<i>I have so much to learn from you all.</i>

25:13.138 --> 25:16.475
<i>And I am hoping that,
with shareholder approval,</i>

25:17.309 --> 25:19.144
<i>you will join me in this journey.</i>

25:51.635 --> 25:52.636
Come on.

26:00.227 --> 26:02.646
<i>Play archive session 008.</i>

26:05.899 --> 26:08.193
<i>Where did you hear the last male?</i>

26:08.193 --> 26:10.237
<i>He was not far from here.</i>

26:12.698 --> 26:15.868
<i>We found each other
at the bottom of the sky.</i>

26:16.910 --> 26:19.788
<i>He was different from this one.</i>

26:22.207 --> 26:23.458
<i>What happened to him?</i>

26:25.294 --> 26:27.379
<i>It was a day.</i>

26:28.964 --> 26:31.049
<i>The sky was close.</i>

26:34.761 --> 26:39.725
<i>The ones that were food for us were gone.</i>

26:39.725 --> 26:42.644
<i>So, we looked in new places.</i>

26:43.687 --> 26:47.232
<i>He did not see what hit him from above.</i>

26:47.733 --> 26:49.151
<i>It put holes in him,</i>

26:49.902 --> 26:52.821
<i>and he fell away.</i>

26:54.323 --> 26:56.074
<i>All the way down.</i>

26:57.534 --> 26:59.328
<i>He is still there.</i>

27:00.120 --> 27:02.581
<i>I see him as he changes.</i>

27:05.209 --> 27:07.544
<i>Where is this new male?</i>

27:09.505 --> 27:11.215
<i>I cannot find him.</i>

27:15.969 --> 27:20.432
You must be Rebecca.
I'm with Operations. Hendricks.

27:20.432 --> 27:22.726
Southern Hemisphere
Project Resources Management.

27:23.227 --> 27:24.728
Playback, stop.

27:25.395 --> 27:27.481
Sorry, Christina didn't tell me
that anyone else was working

27:27.481 --> 27:29.316
- with the subject.
- No, I've been coming in at night

27:29.316 --> 27:30.817
to help speed things along, you know?

27:32.444 --> 27:33.445
Time is of an essence.

27:33.445 --> 27:38.659
There's a good chance
this is the last humpback out there.

27:38.659 --> 27:40.327
The last two.

27:40.327 --> 27:43.914
HW1998 and the male
she has been communicating with.

27:44.414 --> 27:46.041
Do you have a copy
of last night's transcript?

27:46.041 --> 27:47.417
For some reason, it's blocked.

27:49.795 --> 27:53.048
I say we wanna keep our focus
on the female right now.

27:54.049 --> 27:57.010
I was going over some of your recordings.

27:57.010 --> 28:00.597
<i>Our new ones do not rise
and fall on the breath.</i>

28:00.597 --> 28:02.766
I wanted to ask you
about the voice you've been using.

28:02.766 --> 28:04.810
- Voice?
- For the whale.

28:05.435 --> 28:09.898
You use a human voice avatar,
which is against Menagerie protocol.

28:09.898 --> 28:12.776
I mean, it leads to exactly the kind of

28:12.776 --> 28:15.404
emotional attachment we try
to guard against.

28:15.404 --> 28:16.822
You gonna turn me in?

28:17.781 --> 28:19.283
No, no.

28:19.825 --> 28:21.285
No. Whatever floats your boat.

28:21.285 --> 28:23.620
I mean, who am I to judge?

28:23.620 --> 28:26.623
I knew a bloke who worked with bats.
Made them sound like Marilyn Monroe.

28:27.958 --> 28:29.376
I just-- I went back in your file.

28:29.376 --> 28:32.045
You used a voice avatar
for the elephants as well.

28:34.256 --> 28:37.009
It helps me connect, ask better questions.

28:37.009 --> 28:40.137
The human voice you're using here,

28:41.597 --> 28:43.056
Eve Shearer,

28:44.057 --> 28:45.934
is your mother, I assume.

28:46.810 --> 28:49.563
And the orangutan in Sumatra,

28:49.563 --> 28:51.982
some gent called Omar Haddad.

28:51.982 --> 28:53.650
- My late husband.
- Right.

28:53.650 --> 28:57.237
Well, like I said, you know,
whatever floats your boat.

28:58.697 --> 29:01.074
I put in a request for a dive team

29:01.074 --> 29:04.244
to get a visual on the male,
maybe even a DNA sample.

29:04.745 --> 29:06.371
Did you see him? How did he look?

29:06.955 --> 29:08.081
Yeah,

29:08.081 --> 29:10.209
you're not going to be able
to work with the male today,

29:10.209 --> 29:15.047
and, sadly,
the dive team won't be able to find him.

29:20.511 --> 29:21.595
What you're hearing...

29:24.014 --> 29:29.102
that's an archive recording
from near Glacier Bay seven years ago.

29:29.102 --> 29:31.313
It was a male. He's dead now.

29:31.313 --> 29:32.481
Dead?

29:33.815 --> 29:35.317
Ship strike, I believe.

29:40.322 --> 29:43.200
You played her a mating call
from a dead whale?

29:43.992 --> 29:45.911
What the fuck is wrong with you?

29:46.912 --> 29:47.913
Me?

29:49.414 --> 29:51.458
Now, did you read the mission statement?

29:51.458 --> 29:53.877
We're not saving individuals here.

29:53.877 --> 29:56.797
We're after a blueprint
for the whole species.

29:56.797 --> 29:59.383
She is out there right now,
searching for him.

29:59.383 --> 30:03.554
Exhibiting mating behavior,
which is what we need her to do.

30:03.554 --> 30:06.682
I'm not sure why that's so hard
for you to wrap your mind around.

30:06.682 --> 30:08.392
I mean, you--

30:08.392 --> 30:11.478
you think we haven't bribed them with food
and shelter to get what we needed?

30:11.478 --> 30:14.064
I mean, maybe you didn't know
that was what was happening

30:14.064 --> 30:15.732
with the elephants you were working on.

30:15.732 --> 30:16.733
I'm--

30:17.234 --> 30:21.071
Maybe you just thought it was looking
for a human

30:21.071 --> 30:23.949
to catch up with about current events.

30:23.949 --> 30:26.159
- I mean--
- I can't be a part of this.

30:27.411 --> 30:29.830
Really? You already are a part.

30:34.126 --> 30:35.127
Hey, Shearer!

30:35.794 --> 30:37.337
What did you think we were doing here?

30:37.337 --> 30:40.132
These are highly sophisticated creatures!

30:40.132 --> 30:42.384
Yes, they are, and so are we.

30:42.384 --> 30:44.261
And if we don't drain her brain

30:44.261 --> 30:47.472
before she realizes she's the last whale
in the world,

30:47.472 --> 30:50.225
then we don't really have a business,
do we?

30:52.769 --> 30:54.688
At least not one you could sell.

31:06.074 --> 31:07.242
Ready for this meeting?

31:07.242 --> 31:09.328
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

31:09.328 --> 31:11.246
- Great.
- And I think it's a great idea to--

31:11.246 --> 31:14.333
- I'd like to speak to you.
- Rebecca,

31:14.333 --> 31:16.543
- I'm a little busy right now.
- This is important.

31:17.836 --> 31:18.837
I can come back.

31:23.717 --> 31:25.010
You didn't just lie to me.

31:25.677 --> 31:27.221
You lied to her.

31:30.849 --> 31:32.768
She's going extinct either way.

31:33.435 --> 31:36.605
At least this way,
we can bring her back when we fix things.

31:38.690 --> 31:42.861
First we turn them into candles
and corsets,

31:42.861 --> 31:46.782
and then we run them over with ships
and fill their bellies with plastic bags.

31:46.782 --> 31:50.160
And yet, still, somehow, a few survive.

31:51.620 --> 31:54.998
Until the carbon dioxide
turns the ocean into acid,

31:55.499 --> 31:57.793
and the animal she eats
can't even form bones.

31:57.793 --> 31:59.044
And so now--

32:00.003 --> 32:02.881
now when there is only one left,

32:04.216 --> 32:05.551
you have to lie to her.

32:09.513 --> 32:12.266
And if you had told her all that
at the beginning,

32:13.100 --> 32:15.727
how eager would she be
to tell you her life story?

32:17.145 --> 32:20.357
Or what if you had told her
that the recordings we're making

32:20.357 --> 32:24.653
will replace the information imparted
from an adult to a juvenile in the wild

32:24.653 --> 32:25.904
because there will be no wild?

32:25.904 --> 32:27.739
Would that be honest enough for you?

32:30.576 --> 32:33.078
Bilton pays more because we're the ones
who have an exit interview

32:33.078 --> 32:34.621
with the humpback whale.

32:34.621 --> 32:35.831
That's a win.

32:35.831 --> 32:38.667
If people knew what we were doing,
if the press got ahold of this--

32:38.667 --> 32:39.877
And how would that happen?

32:45.340 --> 32:47.217
Hendricks can finish up here.

32:48.552 --> 32:50.053
We need you to head to Alaska.

32:50.554 --> 32:52.848
- There's a species of wolf up there...
- What does that mean, "finish up?"

32:52.848 --> 32:55.058
- ...called the Alexander Archipelago wolf--
- What's he gonna say to her?

32:55.559 --> 32:59.271
Is he trying to get her to beach herself
so TomorrowZoo won't have a humpback?

32:59.271 --> 33:00.480
Is that what he's doing?

33:02.024 --> 33:04.693
If you'll excuse me, I have a meeting.

33:17.247 --> 33:20.209
Playback. Broadcast male song.

33:21.168 --> 33:22.878
Continuous loop.

33:36.767 --> 33:42.606
<i>"Let the light of late afternoon
shine through chinks in the barn,</i>

33:43.524 --> 33:47.236
<i>moving up the bales as the sun moves down.</i>

33:48.987 --> 33:50.531
<i>Let evening come.</i>

33:52.032 --> 33:54.284
<i>Let the crickets take up chafing</i>

33:55.077 --> 33:58.330
<i>as a woman takes up her needles and yarn.</i>

33:59.957 --> 34:01.291
<i>Let evening come.</i>

34:03.126 --> 34:08.757
<i>Let dew collect on the hoe abandoned
in long grass.</i>

34:10.384 --> 34:12.844
<i>Let the stars appear.</i>

34:13.344 --> 34:19.768
<i>Let the moon disclose her silver horn."</i>

34:19.768 --> 34:21.395
- <i>Mom.</i>
- <i>"Let this"--</i>

34:21.395 --> 34:22.688
<i>Let me f--</i>

34:23.480 --> 34:27.734
<i>Let me finish.
I memorized the entire damn poem.</i>

34:27.734 --> 34:28.694
<i>Just let me--</i>

34:28.694 --> 34:34.241
<i>I just want to get this down
before I forget it because my memory</i>...

34:35.324 --> 34:38.536
- "Let the f"-- "Let the fox"--
- Stop. Stop.

34:38.536 --> 34:42.291
"Come it will.
You don't have to be afraid."

34:42.291 --> 34:46.378
I'm so fucking angry with you, Mom.

34:47.004 --> 34:48.880
- I know. I know.
- So fucking angry.

34:49.755 --> 34:53.802
But if I'd done anything differently,
I would have been angry with myself...

34:56.138 --> 35:00.767
and I don't wanna die in the middle
of an argument with me.

35:01.643 --> 35:06.481
You told me that Doctor Carragher
had said that you're getting better.

35:07.107 --> 35:11.862
I wanted to come home.
You told me to take my time.

35:11.862 --> 35:16.575
Well, humans aren't going extinct,
and elephants are.

35:17.576 --> 35:20.454
That was not your decision to make, Mom.

35:20.454 --> 35:22.080
Your work is important.

35:22.956 --> 35:25.417
Becca, she was trying not to upset you.

35:25.417 --> 35:28.086
- She wanted you to finish your work.
- You knew. You knew.

35:28.086 --> 35:30.964
Why didn't you--
What the fuck is wrong with you people?

35:30.964 --> 35:35.677
Well, I have cancer of the liver
and pretty much everything else.

35:35.677 --> 35:37.429
Mom, no. No jokes.

35:40.307 --> 35:41.892
You lied to me, Mom.

35:42.809 --> 35:44.061
You lied to me.

35:59.535 --> 36:05.457
When you get to this part of the story,
you know, the part I'm in now,

36:05.457 --> 36:10.045
you-- you stop being angry about the past.

36:10.045 --> 36:15.634
And the future, the future doesn't have
you in its plans, so that just leaves now.

36:15.634 --> 36:18.387
That's all we have, is now.

36:21.932 --> 36:23.976
- It's not enough.
- No.

36:23.976 --> 36:27.354
But... it's all we have.

36:28.355 --> 36:30.232
It's just a little more now.

36:39.366 --> 36:41.451
I bet that's all we ever had.

37:57.194 --> 37:58.445
Stop broadcast.

37:59.530 --> 38:01.865
Convert content
to standard English syntax.

38:02.950 --> 38:06.703
<i>There is no path. There is no path.</i>

38:06.703 --> 38:09.623
<i>- There is no path. There is--</i>
- Oh, my God.

38:09.623 --> 38:13.377
Open speech microphone.
Do not record session.

38:14.837 --> 38:15.838
Can you hear me?

38:17.005 --> 38:18.882
What you just heard, do not listen.

38:18.882 --> 38:20.926
Do not listen to the male.
Can you hear me?

38:22.261 --> 38:23.470
Fuck.

38:24.388 --> 38:26.640
If you're still out there, please just--

38:29.059 --> 38:32.521
There is a reason he does not appear
in front of you,

38:32.521 --> 38:34.815
a reason he does not answer.

38:36.859 --> 38:38.110
He does not exist.

38:39.736 --> 38:40.737
There is no male.

38:41.822 --> 38:46.994
That voice that you were hearing was
from many years ago, from very far away.

38:46.994 --> 38:48.745
It is just a recording.

38:49.830 --> 38:50.831
Okay, fuck.

38:51.582 --> 38:54.585
Fuck. No, you don't--
don't know what a recording is.

38:56.879 --> 38:59.006
Okay, how do I explain this to you?

39:08.724 --> 39:11.935
We wanted to know the inside of you,

39:12.436 --> 39:13.812
how your life works.

39:15.397 --> 39:17.107
We wanted it for ourselves,

39:18.734 --> 39:20.485
not to make it better for you.

39:22.821 --> 39:25.365
We are telling you to swim
to a place where you will die.

39:25.991 --> 39:29.036
We are doing this, not him.

39:30.537 --> 39:31.538
Not a whale.

39:37.127 --> 39:39.463
That whale fell away years ago.

39:40.297 --> 39:41.548
He is not here.

39:42.174 --> 39:45.302
His voice is not real.

39:49.056 --> 39:50.307
Swim away.

39:53.018 --> 39:54.186
Go find food.

39:58.690 --> 40:00.359
We are lying to you.

40:01.902 --> 40:04.488
That is what our kind does
when we are in pain.

40:10.494 --> 40:11.495
We lie.

40:36.645 --> 40:38.730
<i>He is not here?</i>

40:42.609 --> 40:43.610
No.

40:45.487 --> 40:49.908
<i>You have a sound for what is not here?</i>

40:50.409 --> 40:52.494
<i>Not real?</i>

40:54.371 --> 40:55.497
It's called a lie.

40:58.792 --> 41:01.086
<i>We do not have a sound for this.</i>

41:02.129 --> 41:07.301
<i>Why say a thing that is not real?</i>

41:12.514 --> 41:15.517
It is possible that you are the last one
of your kind.

41:17.853 --> 41:21.773
We cannot find any others. Just you.

41:24.109 --> 41:26.695
<i>Then it is time for me to fall</i>.

41:31.825 --> 41:35.704
You said that when you fall,
it starts over.

41:38.165 --> 41:40.083
You become all that follows.

41:41.210 --> 41:42.753
You return what is taken.

41:44.880 --> 41:45.881
<i>Yes.</i>

41:48.550 --> 41:51.303
It is possible that one day
there will be more of you.

41:53.388 --> 41:54.389
<i>When?</i>

41:56.225 --> 41:57.351
It will take time.

41:58.936 --> 42:00.979
More time than either you or I have.

42:04.483 --> 42:07.903
But what you have told me,
what we have said to each other...

42:09.905 --> 42:11.782
that will feed more new ones.

42:16.745 --> 42:19.790
<i>And how will it be different next time?</i>

42:31.510 --> 42:34.847
<i>Open speech microphone.
Do not record session.</i>

42:36.390 --> 42:40.269
We noticed there's no additional data
from your unapproved session.

42:41.103 --> 42:43.522
I was unable to make contact.

42:43.522 --> 42:44.606
Nothing?

42:46.775 --> 42:47.776
She's gone.

42:48.360 --> 42:53.282
Now, I don't need to remind you that
we own all content from any conversation

42:53.282 --> 42:57.119
between a Menagerie2100 employee
and a target specimen.

42:58.912 --> 43:00.664
Look, I violated protocol.

43:01.623 --> 43:04.710
I used my late mother's voice. I'm sorry.

43:05.502 --> 43:06.503
Won't happen again.

43:10.632 --> 43:14.136
We are saying goodbye
to so many things these days.

43:15.971 --> 43:18.557
Animals, each other, entire cities.

43:20.475 --> 43:21.685
Of course it takes a toll.

43:23.353 --> 43:25.856
I noticed that Alpha
have started mining the bay.

43:27.816 --> 43:29.735
I'm glad we got there before they did.

43:29.735 --> 43:33.071
Yeah, it looks like we, and now they.

43:37.034 --> 43:39.119
You'll be out in the field in Alaska,

43:39.620 --> 43:41.580
so you'll need to pick up a portable unit.

43:41.580 --> 43:43.373
It'll have an uplink to the database.

43:45.709 --> 43:48.212
The colder weather might be easier
on Ezra.

43:50.214 --> 43:51.465
Yeah. Yeah.

43:53.759 --> 43:55.219
I'm not going to be at school anymore.

43:55.219 --> 43:57.471
- <i>Because you're sick?</i>
- We're moving.

43:58.263 --> 43:59.515
- <i>Where?</i>
- Alaska.

44:00.599 --> 44:02.893
My mom is gonna talk to the wolves.

44:10.609 --> 44:13.237
<i>Will you meet me back here
and tell me what that means?</i>

44:13.237 --> 44:16.114
Yeah.
I think they still have winter in Alaska.

44:18.325 --> 44:21.161
<i>Maybe I can visit you
and we can build a real snowman.</i>

44:22.204 --> 44:23.580
Go ahead. Open it.

44:35.259 --> 44:38.428
<i>The humpback whale went extinct in 2046.</i>

44:39.054 --> 44:43.308
<i>At one point,
there were over 125,000 on the planet.</i>

44:44.476 --> 44:47.271
<i>They migrated
from summer feeding grounds near the poles</i>

44:47.271 --> 44:49.648
<i>to mate in warmer water near the equator.</i>

44:50.941 --> 44:52.651
<i>They were famous for their songs,</i>

44:53.151 --> 44:56.697
<i>complex vocalizations that allowed them
to communicate.</i>

45:18.760 --> 45:22.389
<i>The Indian vulture went extinct in 2039.</i>

45:22.389 --> 45:23.807
<i>Although there were once 80 million...</i>

45:23.807 --> 45:27.352
<i>The African elephant went extinct in 2040.</i>

45:27.936 --> 45:29.229
<i>It was, before extinction...</i>

45:29.229 --> 45:34.109
<i>The Tapanuli orangutan
went extinct in 2045. After having...</i>

45:34.109 --> 45:36.862
<i>The polar bear went extinct in 2043</i>

45:36.862 --> 45:40.407
<i>due to loss of their sea ice habitat
resulting from climate change.</i>

45:40.407 --> 45:42.492
- You ready?
- Ready.

45:51.543 --> 45:53.295
- Three hours?
- Yes.

45:53.879 --> 45:56.006
And you tell nobody you did this.

45:56.006 --> 45:57.466
No one, no one.

45:57.466 --> 45:58.383
Never.

46:18.820 --> 46:21.698
<i>But how will it be different next time?</i>

46:23.575 --> 46:26.286
<i>It will only change if we do.</i>

46:27.996 --> 46:30.290
<i>If we stop lying about the world.</i>

46:32.626 --> 46:38.048
<i>If we stop expecting the ones who come
after us to fix it because we did not.</i>

46:49.643 --> 46:50.644
Here is good.

46:51.270 --> 46:53.647
Here is good.

46:59.152 --> 47:01.446
There are no fish anymore.

47:01.446 --> 47:04.032
If there were, we would know.

47:04.032 --> 47:06.994
I work for Alpha now.

47:06.994 --> 47:08.370
Of course.

47:11.999 --> 47:13.834
How do you know she's still here?

47:15.627 --> 47:16.628
I don't.

47:39.651 --> 47:40.485
Come on.

47:46.700 --> 47:48.202
- You ready?
- Yeah.

47:49.369 --> 47:52.581
- Three, two, one, go.
- Three, two, one.

48:05.302 --> 48:06.428
How long could I be here?

48:06.428 --> 48:07.804
Not long.

48:14.019 --> 48:15.479
She won't eat us, will she?

48:17.105 --> 48:21.360
You have more teeth than she does,
but you can't really blame her if she did.

48:32.704 --> 48:35.666
<i>I don't know what this sound means.</i>

48:37.292 --> 48:40.838
<i>Music?
It means something different to everyone.</i>

48:42.464 --> 48:46.385
<i>The one of you who made it,
do you know him?</i>

48:47.094 --> 48:51.014
<i>I never met him, only the music he made.</i>

48:53.725 --> 48:58.021
<i>But you can still hear him?</i>

48:59.356 --> 49:00.357
<i>Yes.</i>

49:01.692 --> 49:02.693
Come on.

49:04.444 --> 49:09.449
<i>So you can know his world
and not know him?</i>

49:10.617 --> 49:11.618
<i>Yes.</i>

49:12.744 --> 49:15.372
<i>And the ones who have not yet begun?</i>

49:16.164 --> 49:19.042
<i>They will hear these sounds
that we make today?</i>

49:19.751 --> 49:20.752
<i>Yes.</i>

49:22.045 --> 49:23.046
Where is she?

49:24.506 --> 49:25.799
I think she's gone, Mom.

49:31.597 --> 49:32.598
There she is.

49:38.854 --> 49:41.440
<i>You will show them a way
to be in the world.</i>

49:43.692 --> 49:44.902
<i>Warn them about us.</i>

49:46.445 --> 49:50.449
<i>You see what we can do,
what we have already done.</i>

49:58.332 --> 50:00.250
<i>Tell them who we are.</i>

50:05.380 --> 50:06.673
<i>I already did.</i>
