WEBVTT

00:06.632 --> 00:09.965
Vodka. Fudge swirl.

00:10.052 --> 00:14.466
Large animal tranq dart.

00:14.557 --> 00:16.218
Okay. We're ready.

00:16.309 --> 00:20.473
Uh huh. You don't think you're
overreacting just a little bit?

00:20.563 --> 00:23.680
Hey, it's called being prepared.
Last time Dyson dumped Bo's ass,

00:23.774 --> 00:27.858
a car got smashed, three Furies died,
and a dude's head was cut off.

00:27.945 --> 00:30.527
And that was when they
were just bang buddies.

00:30.615 --> 00:33.982
Yeah, tiny girl's got a point.
But why do l have to be here?

00:34.076 --> 00:35.816
Because your boy started this.

00:35.912 --> 00:38.779
Sidekick solidarity.
Check your contract.

00:38.873 --> 00:39.953
Just be really cool.

00:40.041 --> 00:45.377
And don't flatter her or
anything. Just be nice. Bo!

00:45.463 --> 00:49.081
Hey! Hi. Hi, guys.

00:49.175 --> 00:51.917
Hi.

00:52.011 --> 00:55.503
Danger, danger--she's lost her shit.

00:55.598 --> 00:59.887
Uh, Bo, we just, you know,
wanted to see if you need anything.

00:59.977 --> 01:04.095
You just came to make sure I wasn't
raging myself to death over Dyson.

01:04.190 --> 01:10.026
Well, thank you very much for your
concern. But I'm fine, guys. Really.

01:10.112 --> 01:13.275
"See?
--We|l, that is suspiciously good news

01:13.366 --> 01:15.778
that is in no way convincing me.

01:15.868 --> 01:18.325
Gotta say, you are handling
this break-up really well.

01:18.412 --> 01:22.075
That is because we didn't break-up.
We were broken up by some hook-nose,

01:22.166 --> 01:25.374
haggy, magic-y old crone, who
probably wouldn't know real love

01:25.461 --> 01:27.452
if it leapt up and bit her in her waddle.

01:27.546 --> 01:30.674
And who I'd be inclined to lay
an epic vengeance beat-down on,

01:30.758 --> 01:34.922
if I wasn't also kind of terrified
by her clearly amazing Fae power.

01:35.012 --> 01:36.127
Pink or blue?

01:36.222 --> 01:38.964
--Blue.
--Pink.

01:39.058 --> 01:43.472
Could you give us a second?
This is kind of a girl thing. Thank you.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.348
It's what I've been saying.

01:49.527 --> 01:52.644
Okay, talk to me. Are you
honestly okay with this?

01:52.738 --> 01:56.572
No, of course not. But last
night, I realized something.

01:56.659 --> 02:01.744
Dyson risked everything for me.
He risked his wolf for me, Kenzi.

02:01.831 --> 02:04.823
He wouldn't do that
unless he really loved me.

02:04.917 --> 02:11.208
Not the sex, not the succubus, me.
I've never had that before.

02:11.299 --> 02:14.666
So, there's no way in
hell I'm letting it go.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.296
Not without a fight.

02:16.387 --> 02:19.879
Well, good. So, what are we gonna do?

02:19.974 --> 02:22.340
I am just gonna have to win him back.

02:22.435 --> 02:24.471
Remind him of how
great we can be together.

02:24.562 --> 02:27.645
Being back at square one
is a blessing in disguise.

02:27.732 --> 02:30.348
I mean, how many couples
get to fall in love twice?

02:30.443 --> 02:35.688
Hm. Well, that's it? Woo?
Your big plan is to woo?

02:35.781 --> 02:41.447
Hey, never underestimate the power
of a desperate woman... in love.

03:01.557 --> 03:03.718
[GLADYS] All right, watch your step.

03:08.272 --> 03:11.105
Good luck, girl. I'm rooting for ya.

03:11.192 --> 03:16.528
Alright, she's all yours. Just sign
the paperwork and she's good to go.

03:36.425 --> 03:41.294
I'm so sorry. But there's
one last thing I need to do.

03:48.562 --> 03:51.474
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

03:51.565 --> 03:54.477
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

03:54.568 --> 03:57.480
My love carries a death sentence.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.653
l was lost for years,

03:59.740 --> 04:02.402
searching, while hiding,

04:02.493 --> 04:06.657
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

04:06.747 --> 04:11.616
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

04:17.758 --> 04:20.591
[HALE] You're lookin' rough.

04:20.678 --> 04:23.135
l was out all night.

04:23.222 --> 04:25.508
Well, all right! That's
what I'm talkin' about.

04:25.599 --> 04:28.432
You shoulda called me, 'cause you
know I'm always up for wingman duty--

04:28.519 --> 04:30.430
l was out hunting.

04:30.521 --> 04:33.729
Uh huh. Doin' a lot of
that since you came back.

04:33.816 --> 04:35.477
You're not going feral on us, are you?

04:35.568 --> 04:38.605
'Cause I heard woman bring the
animal out of your kind, not break-ups.

04:38.696 --> 04:42.029
Give me that file. What do we got?

04:42.116 --> 04:44.983
Light Fae, prisoner escaped
from the catacombs.

04:45.077 --> 04:47.489
That's the direction she was running.

04:47.580 --> 04:48.535
Was anyone injured?

04:48.622 --> 04:52.160
Not fatally, but she's packin'
poison in those damn quills of hers.

04:52.251 --> 04:53.457
We were knocked out for hours.

04:53.544 --> 04:56.001
Well, what is she doin' all
the way out here, anyways?

04:56.088 --> 04:58.875
I mean, this is, you know,
miles from the catacombs.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.082
Well, we brought her, prisoner transfer.

05:01.177 --> 05:05.216
She's been in bond for 80 years.
Why you movin' her now?

05:05.306 --> 05:07.012
And on whose authority?

05:07.099 --> 05:09.556
I mean, the Ash isn't exactly
running things these days.

05:09.643 --> 05:12.055
They didn't tell you guys yet?

05:15.316 --> 05:16.226
What are we drinkin'?

05:16.317 --> 05:19.605
Something cold, wet,
and on your dime.

05:19.695 --> 05:20.810
My cheapest ale it is.

05:20.905 --> 05:22.736
So, I've been wanting to ask you,

05:22.823 --> 05:25.109
what do you know about
this Norn Dyson visited?

05:25.201 --> 05:26.737
Why?

05:41.550 --> 05:43.586
What?! All the cool kids are doing it.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.089
Actually, just the Light Fae,
by the looks of it.

05:46.180 --> 05:47.920
I'm guessing he's
some kind of honcho?

05:48.015 --> 05:52.554
An emissary from the old country.
I suppose it was only a matter of time.

05:52.645 --> 05:54.556
May you be the keeper
of this waystation?

05:54.647 --> 06:00.017
That I am. Well met. Fitzpatrick
MacCorieghan of the clan Fin Arvin.

06:00.110 --> 06:02.487
Guy DuCharme.

06:02.571 --> 06:04.687
By your colours, l'd name
you the Blackthorn.

06:04.782 --> 06:06.568
And you'd be the right of it.

06:06.659 --> 06:07.774
To what do we owe this honour?

06:07.868 --> 06:11.452
Oh, just came to have a little
poke around. See the sights.

06:11.539 --> 06:14.155
Make a little
proclamation to the people.

06:14.250 --> 06:16.536
[bell]

06:16.627 --> 06:20.711
Let it be known--by order of
the Council, in two days' time,

06:20.798 --> 06:24.290
a new successor to
the Ash will be named.

06:24.385 --> 06:26.922
Let the selection games begin!

06:27.012 --> 06:31.130
[Cheering]

06:31.225 --> 06:35.218
[cell phone ringing]

06:35.312 --> 06:38.224
Dr. Lewis. Wow, loud.

06:38.315 --> 06:41.807
Yeah, yeah, sorry. lt's rampant
frivolity here at the moment.

06:41.902 --> 06:42.687
[LAUREN] Where are you?

06:42.778 --> 06:48.318
At the Dal. Listen, | just thought you
should know--they're replacing the Ash.

06:48.409 --> 06:50.946
What?

06:51.036 --> 06:54.824
Wh-Who? Um... what
are you talking about?

06:54.915 --> 06:57.247
[BO] Oh, some guy from
merry old Faetown is here.

06:57.334 --> 07:01.247
However they elect new Ashes,
it's going down this weekend.

07:04.008 --> 07:07.000
--Are you there?
--Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

07:07.094 --> 07:10.552
Look, I'll see what else I can find
out, okay? I'll call you later?

07:10.639 --> 07:14.131
Yeah. Please do.

07:26.196 --> 07:28.061
[HALE] It's not like we choose
a local government every day,

07:28.157 --> 07:30.443
so it's kind of a big deal, you know?

07:30.534 --> 07:34.368
Lots of rituals, a big-ass
feast, and a stag hunt.

07:34.455 --> 07:36.616
Ooh! Will there be wenches and mead?

07:36.707 --> 07:39.198
Hey, hey--you crash the party,
there'll definitely be a wench.

07:39.293 --> 07:41.454
[BO] So, who is this
Blackthorn, anyway?

07:41.545 --> 07:46.039
Uh uh. "The" Blackthorn.
Like "the" Ash, it's a title, not a name.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.419
The Dark Fae take their
names from dead warriors.

07:48.510 --> 07:51.547
Light leaders are named
after our sacred trees.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.755
Trees. Buncha hippies.

07:53.849 --> 07:56.682
So, this is a good thing
for us then? A new Ash?

07:56.769 --> 07:59.260
Uh, depends on who's chosen. I mean,

07:59.355 --> 08:02.188
we won't even know who's in
the running until the big gala.

08:02.274 --> 08:06.187
And then whichever contender
wins the hunt gets the big gig.

08:06.278 --> 08:09.236
And how do we get
tickets to this shindig?

08:09.323 --> 08:10.813
You ladies lookin' to be my date?

08:10.908 --> 08:15.026
Thanks, but we've got
other places we need to be.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.496
Have fun storming the castle.

08:16.580 --> 08:17.865
Aww. Seriously?

08:17.956 --> 08:20.663
[HALE] Yeah, well, the
line-up's long, anyway.

08:26.298 --> 08:28.459
When do we turn down
the chance for a free party?

08:28.550 --> 08:30.006
It's like I don't even
know you anymore.

08:30.094 --> 08:32.255
Trust me. Nothing is free
when it comes to these guys

08:32.346 --> 08:34.257
and their little reality show.

08:34.348 --> 08:38.261
"Survivor: Fae Island." I would tune in.

08:38.352 --> 08:41.139
Look, Aife got messed up in politics

08:41.230 --> 08:43.972
and nearly blew everything
to hell for us, literally.

08:44.066 --> 08:47.183
I'd just as soon not get involved
in any Fae authority for a while,

08:47.277 --> 08:51.020
--thank you very much.
--Aww, your mom ruins everything.

08:51.115 --> 08:55.609
Come on! How much fun
would this be, huh?

08:55.703 --> 08:58.866
Feasting and hunting stags and kilts

08:58.956 --> 09:03.416
and bangers and mash
and Mary Poppins!

09:03.502 --> 09:05.914
Are you feeling okay?

09:06.004 --> 09:08.381
I'm all outta British crap. You win.

09:08.465 --> 09:12.629
| always do. Just trust me, okay?
You will thank me later.

09:12.720 --> 09:16.053
The further we stay away from this
succession business, the better.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.760
What the...

09:19.852 --> 09:22.138
--Don't be scared.
--How about violent?

09:22.229 --> 09:25.016
Look, if you're Bo, I need your help.

09:25.107 --> 09:26.096
What kinda help?

09:26.191 --> 09:28.523
You know that stag hunt
you were just talking about?

09:28.610 --> 09:30.396
Yeah.

09:30.487 --> 09:32.569
I'm the stag.

09:36.201 --> 09:38.362
Oh, crap.

09:43.041 --> 09:47.000
I've really got to start
enforcing last call around here.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.954
So, how much does
the Blackthorn know?

09:50.048 --> 09:53.381
That there was an attack on our
Elders under the Ash's nose.

09:53.469 --> 09:57.257
He wants the Ash replaced as
punishment, wounded or not.

09:57.347 --> 09:58.382
And of Aife?

09:58.474 --> 10:01.716
He didn't mention any link
between her and the bombings.

10:01.810 --> 10:05.018
As far as I can tell,
no one knows Aife's returned.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.141
Why? Do you think
there's more to his visit?

10:07.232 --> 10:11.521
If he's got more cards to play,
he's keeping them close to his chest.

10:13.405 --> 10:15.691
Just have to wait and see.

10:25.876 --> 10:27.707
Why would they be hunting you?

10:27.795 --> 10:30.502
Tradition. To prove his or her merit,

10:30.589 --> 10:33.877
contenders for the Ash compete
by fighting a worthy prey.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.925
The stag is always a prisoner and well...

10:37.012 --> 10:39.298
You're an escaped convict. Wonderful.

10:39.389 --> 10:41.254
What did you do to get
sent to the pokey?

10:41.350 --> 10:43.341
I followed my heart.

10:43.435 --> 10:47.053
l was planning to elope with
the man I loved, Hamish.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.887
Neither of our peoples would
have approved our union.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.358
We had no safe haven.

10:50.442 --> 10:52.854
--Was he human?
--Dark Fae.

10:52.945 --> 10:58.656
l'm Light. We knew it was
treason, but we didn't care.

10:58.742 --> 11:02.280
We were young. We were na'ive.

11:03.664 --> 11:06.497
We believed our love
really would conquer all.

11:19.805 --> 11:22.387
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

11:30.232 --> 11:34.225
Don't ever leave me.

11:38.282 --> 11:40.648
We could have gone on in
secret like that for years.

11:40.742 --> 11:42.653
But his clan was arranging
a marriage for him.

11:42.744 --> 11:46.362
We had 24 hours to make our
escape or lose each other forever.

11:46.456 --> 11:47.992
What happened?

11:52.421 --> 11:55.754
[SABINE] We decided to meet
that night and make our escape.

11:59.970 --> 12:01.335
But something went wrong.

12:01.430 --> 12:05.719
l was met by Light Fae guards who knew
of our plan and accused me of treason.

12:05.809 --> 12:10.052
I fought. In the struggle, one of the
guardsmen was seriously injured.

12:10.147 --> 12:12.388
I've been imprisoned ever since.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.143
[BO] How long?

12:14.234 --> 12:15.440
83 years.

12:15.527 --> 12:18.985
Pfff. Your penal system
does not Fae around.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.323
What about Hamish?

12:20.407 --> 12:25.777
I never saw him that night.
Or ever again.

12:25.871 --> 12:29.705
I still don't know if it was the Dark Fae
who betrayed us, or my own people.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.247
[knocking]

12:31.335 --> 12:32.290
They're here!

12:32.377 --> 12:34.288
--Here we go. Kenz?
--On it.

12:34.379 --> 12:36.665
[knocking]

12:36.757 --> 12:39.794
I am not afraid to die,
but I have one final request.

12:39.885 --> 12:44.845
To know that Hamish is well and to see
him one last time. Will you help me?

12:46.391 --> 12:48.803
--I will.
--Thank you.

12:48.894 --> 12:50.350
Bo!

12:52.856 --> 12:55.472
This is not Light Fae territory. Get out.

12:55.567 --> 13:02.735
Bo. Stand down, and wait outside.
I speak for the Blackthorn.

13:10.415 --> 13:11.951
What the hell is going on?

13:12.042 --> 13:13.703
You're outnumbered, Bo.

13:13.794 --> 13:16.456
It's better for everyone if the
girl just comes peacefully.

13:16.546 --> 13:18.707
Uh, except for her.

13:18.799 --> 13:20.460
I'm gonna take her in myself, Kenz.

13:20.550 --> 13:23.963
She will be safe and well-cared
for until the hunt. It's the law.

13:24.054 --> 13:27.546
He's right. I said what I came to say.

13:27.641 --> 13:32.476
You can't help me if you get
yourself into some kind of trouble.

13:32.562 --> 13:34.723
I don't even know your name.

13:36.066 --> 13:37.806
Sabine.

13:45.701 --> 13:47.362
Where will you take her?

13:47.452 --> 13:49.113
The Ash's compound.

13:49.204 --> 13:53.368
Thank you. For still lookin' out for me.

13:55.794 --> 13:59.503
You kinda sprung some big stuff on me.

13:59.589 --> 14:06.301
Trading in your feelings to save my
life. That's one messed up love letter.

14:06.388 --> 14:12.725
We need to talk, alone.
You owe me at least that.

14:12.811 --> 14:16.269
We will. Just not now.

14:23.947 --> 14:28.111
Oh, good. You came.

14:28.201 --> 14:33.946
Bo, the undecided. You know,
I'll be the envy of political pundits

14:34.041 --> 14:36.327
for years, just from this meeting.

14:36.418 --> 14:41.082
Great. Listen, your people abducted
a guest from my house last night.

14:41.173 --> 14:42.333
That's not okay.

14:42.424 --> 14:44.506
Well, technically she was our prisoner.

14:44.593 --> 14:48.552
Are you seriously going to hunt
her down and kill her for sport?

14:48.638 --> 14:52.130
Not sport. Ritual.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.886
I'll never understand you people.

14:53.977 --> 14:56.844
You slaughter your own kind,
yet you call yourselves "Light" Fae.

14:56.938 --> 14:58.769
Ahh. Ya see that?

14:58.857 --> 15:02.725
That right there is why some
argue that we need a re-branding.

15:02.819 --> 15:06.562
Would you mind if I just
borrowed you for a moment?

15:09.493 --> 15:14.954
Look. Humans are food.
We eat from them or we die.

15:15.040 --> 15:22.082
Now the Dark Fae, they tend to
kill for pleasure, not just need.

15:22.172 --> 15:23.161
Show me the red.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.996
And you Light are so much better?

15:25.092 --> 15:28.459
Well, we're more like your
Native American hunters.

15:28.553 --> 15:32.922
We respect the kill. Won't
over-hunt. Don't eat the young.

15:33.016 --> 15:35.007
And so, what does that make me?

15:35.102 --> 15:36.387
An obnoxious vegan.

15:36.478 --> 15:38.969
Oh, thank you. I take
that as a compliment.

15:39.064 --> 15:40.645
You would.

15:43.026 --> 15:45.563
Stag hunt is a respected tradition.

15:45.654 --> 15:47.610
Through their willing sacrifice,

15:47.697 --> 15:51.110
stags' crimes are forgiven,
returning honour to the family name.

15:51.201 --> 15:52.782
It's really quite an equitable system.

15:52.869 --> 15:55.451
Okay, wait--willing sacrifice?

15:55.539 --> 15:58.030
Stag always volunteers.

15:58.125 --> 16:02.209
If you had a chance to go out free and
fighting instead of rotting in a cell,

16:02.295 --> 16:04.126
wouldn't you take it?

16:04.214 --> 16:09.425
Look. I don't want to get
off on the wrong foot here.

16:09.511 --> 16:11.752
And this isn't me
asking you permission,

16:11.847 --> 16:15.305
because you and I both
know that I don't do that.

16:15.392 --> 16:16.848
I'm listening.

16:16.935 --> 16:20.928
Sabine asked to speak to her
old love as a sort of dying wish.

16:21.022 --> 16:26.392
And | just thought you should
know that I'm going to do that.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.023
Well, now I know.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.407
What's this?

16:34.494 --> 16:39.113
A little something to wear to
tomorrow's gala. Come be my guest.

16:39.207 --> 16:41.619
See how civilized we can be.

16:46.256 --> 16:51.000
Oh, and bring that bartender along.
He seems like he'd be fun.

16:52.929 --> 16:56.592
Next time, ask him if he has Gucci, too.

16:56.683 --> 17:00.767
I'll just be happier when this Blackthorn
guy leaves town, couture aside.

17:00.854 --> 17:03.311
This whole Fae election
thing is creeping me out.

17:03.398 --> 17:06.356
Are you sure Hale gave us the
right info for this Hamish dude?

17:06.443 --> 17:10.732
He's not answering his phone.
And the files were hella old.

17:10.822 --> 17:12.562
Well, maybe he's not home.

17:12.657 --> 17:14.113
Oh, hey, speaking of not home,

17:14.201 --> 17:15.987
can you give me some
space on Saturday night?

17:16.077 --> 17:17.908
Dyson agreed to come over and talk.

17:17.996 --> 17:24.117
Oh, gotcha. Operation Woo begins.
And what is your plan of attack?

17:24.211 --> 17:26.202
Cleavage. That's about
as far as I've gotten.

17:26.296 --> 17:30.835
Honey, that's farther
than some of us ever get.

17:30.926 --> 17:34.043
--Yes?
--Hi. Hamish?

17:34.137 --> 17:35.343
Where did you get this address?

17:35.430 --> 17:37.341
We've been leaving you
messages about Sabine.

17:37.432 --> 17:39.138
You may not have gotten them?

17:39.226 --> 17:40.261
I got 'em.

17:40.352 --> 17:43.970
Oh. Okay, good. So, you'll
come with us to see her?

17:44.064 --> 17:47.932
I don't think so, but thank you.

17:48.026 --> 17:51.518
Clearly, there's been some kind
of communication error here.

17:51.613 --> 17:54.605
See, I'm talking about Sabine Purcell.

17:54.699 --> 17:58.317
The woman who's spent the last 80 years
in chains for wanting to be with you.

17:58.411 --> 18:01.244
Those were her actions,
not mine. I can't help you.

18:01.331 --> 18:04.744
She just wants to say good-bye.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.210
You loved her once?

18:06.294 --> 18:08.831
Yeah. And I've had 80 years
to get over it. She should, too.

18:08.922 --> 18:11.755
This is serious.

18:11.841 --> 18:14.924
She's volunteered to be the stag.

18:22.143 --> 18:25.635
[KENZI] Whoa.

18:25.730 --> 18:31.316
"80 years to get over it"? I'll give
him 80 years of my foot up his ass.

18:31.403 --> 18:33.189
That's the jackhole she's dying over?

18:33.280 --> 18:35.236
Bo? Honey?

18:35.323 --> 18:38.406
Look, I know you're a little
sensi-tivo when it comes to,

18:38.493 --> 18:40.905
you know, penis-related
rejections at the moment.

18:40.996 --> 18:42.952
And I know you're probably going
to be tempted to personalize this--

18:43.039 --> 18:45.291
Kenzi, this isn't about me.
| get that, okay?

18:45.375 --> 18:51.041
Cool. So, we're not going to
get any more involved, right?

18:51.131 --> 18:53.747
--Right.
--Right.

18:53.842 --> 18:57.334
Oh, except for the part where
we're gonna save Sabine's life now

18:57.429 --> 18:59.420
and not get caught doing it.

19:02.559 --> 19:04.891
| wish I could quit you.

19:04.978 --> 19:07.219
[BO] Come on, let's go!

19:07.314 --> 19:09.475
Yes, ma'am.

19:14.863 --> 19:18.776
Okay, talk me through it. What's the
process for naming the new Ash?

19:18.867 --> 19:22.405
First, the potential candidates
gather for the Gyallahaal.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.156
Which one--Jake or Maggie?

19:24.247 --> 19:29.241
It's a gala in the stag's honour.
But actually, it's the first competition.

19:29.336 --> 19:32.703
A test of political skill and cunning.

19:32.797 --> 19:33.786
And those who survive it--

19:33.882 --> 19:37.374
--Survive it?
--Receive enough votes,

19:37.469 --> 19:39.255
are deemed contenders.

19:39.346 --> 19:42.884
And they compete in the hunt.
And you know how the hunt ends.

19:42.974 --> 19:46.137
Not if Sabine makes it to the bell.
She'll be allowed to live free and clear.

19:46.227 --> 19:49.765
But, Bo, that never happens.
The entire system is canted against it.

19:49.856 --> 19:54.145
Well, then we have to uncant it. Fast.

19:54.235 --> 19:56.191
There has to be a way
that we can save Sabine

19:56.279 --> 20:00.989
without breaking their rules
and pissing off the Blackthorn.

20:01.076 --> 20:03.567
I know I can at least get
into the gala as his guest.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.492
Oh, by the way, he
wants you there, too.

20:05.580 --> 20:07.491
--He said that?
--But I still can't be part of the hunt,

20:07.582 --> 20:10.494
I'm not Light Fae.

20:10.585 --> 20:12.041
What about Dyson?

20:12.128 --> 20:13.243
No, there's not enough time,

20:13.338 --> 20:15.420
he'd never make it through
the vetting process.

20:15.507 --> 20:19.216
At this point, it would have to
be somebody of noble blood.

20:19.302 --> 20:20.963
Well, you must know
some old noble family type

20:21.054 --> 20:23.136
we can exploit into helping us?

20:23.223 --> 20:25.305
Actually, we all do.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.428
Who?

20:27.519 --> 20:31.808
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Uh uh.
Not happening, little mamas.

20:31.898 --> 20:34.810
Poseur! Why did you not tell us
your family was hooked up?

20:34.901 --> 20:36.516
They're not hooked up. They're old.

20:36.611 --> 20:38.317
Old, as in old money.

20:38.405 --> 20:41.613
Old, as in stuff being judgmental
and generally disapproving

20:41.699 --> 20:46.489
of any non-traditional life I
want to make for myself, okay?

20:46.579 --> 20:48.615
Look, if I wanted to give my
grandmamma the satisfaction

20:48.706 --> 20:50.833
of getting into politics,
I'd have done it decades ago.

20:50.917 --> 20:57.083
Oh, boo hoo. I'm sure you had it so
rough, Lord Gutless of Nobsburg.

20:58.258 --> 21:00.795
Okay. Maybe we just need
to ask His Highness nicely.

21:00.885 --> 21:04.719
Oh, you're right. Perhaps, in a
manner befitting his station.

21:04.806 --> 21:05.966
Yes.

21:06.057 --> 21:08.343
--Please, sir...
--Please, sir...

21:08.435 --> 21:10.767
--Please.
--Please.
--This is nice. Yeah.

21:10.854 --> 21:14.267
Seriously! You could help
save a woman's life here.

21:14.357 --> 21:17.565
And nobody is asking you
to win. You just have to run.

21:17.652 --> 21:20.940
Yeah, and losing could be, like, a whole
new way to disappoint your family.

21:21.030 --> 21:22.190
--Yeah.
--Huh?

21:22.282 --> 21:25.866
Yeah, and I would really love to see
you kissing hands and shaking babies.

21:25.952 --> 21:28.819
Ha, ha, ha. Well, joke's on
you anyways, Cinderella.

21:28.913 --> 21:30.995
No humans at this ball.

21:32.375 --> 21:36.618
Now, what's your brilliant plan?

21:38.381 --> 21:40.838
[BO] To save Sabine, we
have to get you in the game.

21:40.925 --> 21:44.417
Hopefuls for the Ash have this
one event to curry favour,

21:44.512 --> 21:48.050
sabotage the competition, and win
enough votes to enter the hunt.

21:48.141 --> 21:51.850
And they'll use any means
necessary, short of murder.

21:51.936 --> 21:54.313
Hale, use your Siren
skills to charm votes,

21:54.397 --> 21:59.016
while I incapacitate your competition
and Dyson will act as protection.

21:59.110 --> 22:00.065
You're sure Dyson's coming?

22:00.153 --> 22:04.112
[HALE] Don't worry. I talked
to him. He's cool. He's in.

22:06.576 --> 22:08.908
Dyson .

22:08.995 --> 22:12.237
The important thing is
for us to work as a team.

22:12.332 --> 22:15.119
Get in, get out, together.

22:16.461 --> 22:19.669
Would you allow me to escort you in?

22:19.756 --> 22:21.212
Here we go.

22:28.056 --> 22:34.894
Wearing the blue, Baronet William
Haley Francois Santiago, clan Zamora.

22:34.979 --> 22:36.355
Haley?

22:36.439 --> 22:38.225
One more word. Just one more,

22:38.316 --> 22:41.353
and I will sing you to sleep
and I'll leave you in a corner.

22:43.446 --> 22:46.062
So, the armbands identify the
competitors, but what are those?

22:46.157 --> 22:50.400
Gias. It's the stone you
use to cast your vote.

22:51.871 --> 22:53.452
Real modern system you got here.

22:53.540 --> 22:57.829
Exactly, old people like old shit.

22:57.919 --> 22:59.375
Excuse me.

23:05.218 --> 23:06.674
Oh, pardon me.

23:06.761 --> 23:08.922
No, no, no. It's my fault.

23:09.013 --> 23:12.972
I hope you won't hold my clumsiness
against me when you cast your vote.

23:15.103 --> 23:18.687
You good on your own?
What do you say?

23:18.773 --> 23:22.607
Well, I'd say that Mr. Green Armband
there is my first target.

23:22.694 --> 23:27.529
Then the cougar and
grandpa and Mr. Big.

23:27.615 --> 23:29.651
I'll try to take them out of competition.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.733
The other two contenders,
they shouldn't get much support.

23:31.828 --> 23:33.989
You work the room
and score some votes.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.492
Let's rock out with our frocks out.

23:58.062 --> 24:03.273
Pleasure. And thank you,
you look stunning.

24:03.359 --> 24:07.193
And who's your tailor?

24:07.280 --> 24:08.770
Enjoy.

24:21.961 --> 24:25.203
Excuse us, please.

24:25.298 --> 24:26.788
Well, hello.

24:26.883 --> 24:29.215
Hi.

24:29.302 --> 24:34.137
|... I've been watching you.

24:34.223 --> 24:36.009
I've noticed.

24:45.735 --> 24:48.898
Oh, I think you might
want to go home now.

24:48.988 --> 24:52.196
Forget all about this
silly little election.

24:56.204 --> 25:00.163
Do you know I think you
over-estimate your talents.

25:00.249 --> 25:04.288
Mind you, those are some talents.

25:14.847 --> 25:18.465
I agree. The pension system
is woefully inadequate.

25:18.559 --> 25:21.722
That's why, as the Ash, I would

25:21.813 --> 25:25.806
double the payouts for anyone
over nine centuries old.

25:25.900 --> 25:29.643
Though, you don't look
a decade over 650.

25:36.744 --> 25:38.200
For you, sir.

25:40.373 --> 25:42.284
Hmm.

25:42.375 --> 25:43.911
My man.

25:57.181 --> 25:59.046
Still got it, dammit.

26:01.185 --> 26:03.471
--[DYSON] Nice.
--Hi.

26:03.563 --> 26:05.599
Hi.

26:05.690 --> 26:07.931
It's good to see you.

26:08.025 --> 26:09.561
It's good to see you, too.

26:09.652 --> 26:12.689
Dyson, we have to talk.

26:12.780 --> 26:15.112
[crashing noise]

26:22.874 --> 26:26.366
So, is it your brilliant plan to
avoid Bo for the rest of your lives?

26:26.461 --> 26:27.951
I don't know what to say to her, Trick.

26:28.045 --> 26:31.378
I warned you about the Norn.
About the Ancients and their trickery.

26:31.466 --> 26:35.630
I'm a big boy, Trick. I knew
what I was getting into.

26:35.720 --> 26:39.212
Then why punish her for
something you chose to do freely?

26:39.307 --> 26:42.640
That's not like you, Dyson.

26:42.727 --> 26:47.562
Well, I'm not exactly me
anymore, am |? That's the point.

26:47.648 --> 26:50.139
You're the one that didn't want us
together and now that that's permanent,

26:50.234 --> 26:53.647
I would say you've lost
your right to complain.

26:57.158 --> 27:04.280
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Ah, the younger
generation, so lippy these days.

27:04.373 --> 27:05.988
Some of us are born lippy.

27:06.083 --> 27:13.046
Ah, like your little protégé, Bo, there.
Quite the firebrand, by all accounts.

27:13.132 --> 27:17.421
But then I hear she takes
after her mother, Aife.

27:19.680 --> 27:22.843
You need to work on your
poker face, my friend.

27:40.117 --> 27:42.529
Hamish, is he here?

27:42.620 --> 27:46.283
No. Good news though,
he's alive and free.

27:46.374 --> 27:47.454
He didn't want to see me?

27:47.542 --> 27:50.158
I tried. I'm so sorry.

27:50.253 --> 27:53.086
Sabine, is it possible that
Hamish was your betrayer?

27:53.172 --> 27:54.287
No, it's not.

27:54.382 --> 27:57.249
--How can you be sure?
--Have you ever been in love?

27:57.343 --> 27:59.584
With someone who loved
you with everything he had?

27:59.679 --> 28:01.886
Yeah, once, apparently.

28:01.973 --> 28:05.841
Then you understand. When you've
been loved like that, you know.

28:05.935 --> 28:06.720
You feel it.

28:06.811 --> 28:08.642
Look, Sabine, I couldn't
bring you Hamish,

28:08.729 --> 28:12.313
but I brought you something
better--a chance.

28:12.400 --> 28:16.234
My friends and |, we're gonna
help you during the hunt.

28:16.320 --> 28:19.778
--Help me how?
--To win. By their own rules.

28:19.866 --> 28:22.528
We'll get you to the end of that
woods alive, you'll win your freedom.

28:22.618 --> 28:24.734
Freedom to what?
To wander alone in a world

28:24.829 --> 28:27.616
I haven't lived in for 80 years?
And risk all your lives

28:27.707 --> 28:28.742
--in the balance?
--Sabine--

28:28.833 --> 28:32.621
Thank you. You've been good to me.

28:32.712 --> 28:35.795
But not every story
has a happy ending.

28:35.882 --> 28:38.248
[crashing noise]

29:03.367 --> 29:06.985
Dumb-ass. I can see auras and
yours is totally hot for Sabine.

29:07.079 --> 29:10.116
--What do you want from me?
--For starters, admit that you love her.

29:10.207 --> 29:12.243
--What?
--You love Sabine! Say it.

29:12.335 --> 29:17.329
Fine. I love her. I love her, okay?

29:17.423 --> 29:20.290
She's the only one I've ever loved.

29:20.384 --> 29:21.464
Then why did you betray her?

29:21.552 --> 29:24.965
I didn't. But I might as well have.

29:25.056 --> 29:29.766
You know, my family, they're not
good people. You understand?

29:29.852 --> 29:31.353
They found out about
us and they were furious

29:31.437 --> 29:34.304
that I would jeopardize
the family name.

29:34.398 --> 29:37.435
So, they tipped off the Light Fae?

29:37.526 --> 29:42.190
And I tried for years to figure
some way to help Sabine. Years.

29:42.281 --> 29:44.488
But what can I do, I'm Dark Fae.

29:47.662 --> 29:49.948
There is something you can do.

29:50.039 --> 29:53.122
Come with me to the hunt.
Help me save her.

29:53.209 --> 29:58.454
No. I don't want to get her hopes up.

29:58.547 --> 30:00.674
It's best I just let her be.

30:02.385 --> 30:06.970
If you really love her,
you'd fight for her.

30:12.520 --> 30:14.010
[THE BLACKTHORN] Congratulations.

30:14.105 --> 30:18.098
You, the final three, have proven
yourselves worthy contenders.

30:18.192 --> 30:19.728
The rules today are simple--

30:19.819 --> 30:23.812
you may use sanctioned weapons only.
You may not kill one another.

30:23.906 --> 30:26.272
The stag has been provided
with a hidden location of the bell.

30:26.367 --> 30:30.110
If she finds it, rings it,
you're all disqualified.

30:32.039 --> 30:34.826
Let the hunt begin.

30:34.917 --> 30:36.703
[horn]

31:41.567 --> 31:45.526
I'm here to help. Do you trust me?

31:45.613 --> 31:47.194
Yeah.

31:47.281 --> 31:49.146
Let's find this bell.

31:59.293 --> 32:01.079
Okay. There it is.

32:01.170 --> 32:03.661
Now if Sabine can just make it
here in one piece and ring it.

32:03.756 --> 32:06.793
Well, at least no one else has
found it. That's a good sign.

32:15.518 --> 32:17.634
There.

32:17.728 --> 32:20.686
Don't stop. You've got to run.

32:20.773 --> 32:22.263
Thank you.

32:36.705 --> 32:40.664
Oh, no. No, no, no. Sabine!
Run! Go, go, go!

32:54.974 --> 32:56.510
Sabine.

33:12.449 --> 33:14.110
She's dead.

33:21.041 --> 33:24.374
If you'll leave the fallen to us.

33:24.461 --> 33:30.297
As I told you, we aren't monsters.
Tend to her burial, if you wish.

33:30.384 --> 33:35.048
Meanwhile, it looks as if we have
ourselves a new Ash to crown.

33:36.807 --> 33:38.513
[horn]

33:44.773 --> 33:48.231
You're the succubus, aren't you?

33:48.319 --> 33:51.152
The one that does as she pleases?

33:51.238 --> 33:53.103
Well, not anymore.

34:06.253 --> 34:07.754
Clear.

34:21.727 --> 34:22.842
How's the wound?

34:22.937 --> 34:24.643
It's just soft tissue damage.

34:24.730 --> 34:28.348
I tried to spin her out of the
arrow's path as best I could.

34:28.442 --> 34:31.229
You fought for her.
Let the doctor do the rest.

34:31.320 --> 34:34.062
You did well. If it had hit the
heart, we'd have no hope.

34:34.156 --> 34:37.569
The problem will be the poison,
but we're prepared for that.

34:46.585 --> 34:51.454
Hamish. You came.

34:51.548 --> 34:53.709
Just 83 years late.

34:57.221 --> 34:59.052
I knew you'd come.

35:01.642 --> 35:03.257
Thank you.

35:07.106 --> 35:10.769
I guess science kicks the
crap outta tradition, huh?

35:41.682 --> 35:42.888
Hi.

35:42.975 --> 35:46.684
--Bo, I can't--
--Wait. Just...

35:46.770 --> 35:50.558
...just let me say a few things.

35:50.649 --> 35:56.235
Thank you for taking
such a risk to protect me.

35:56.322 --> 36:01.658
And wow, this is overdue--

36:01.744 --> 36:04.326
I'm sorry.

36:04.413 --> 36:10.830
Until recently, I've been
kind of stubborn and blind

36:10.919 --> 36:13.331
about how good we were together.

36:15.257 --> 36:21.753
So, here's to starting
over, if you'll let me.

36:25.517 --> 36:28.805
This is my fault.

36:28.896 --> 36:33.230
I obviously wasn't as clear
as I should have been.

36:33.317 --> 36:37.105
I told you once that
wolves mate for life.

36:37.196 --> 36:42.441
Well, I gave that love to you.
And I don't regret it.

36:42.534 --> 36:43.865
But the Norn took it.

36:43.952 --> 36:49.447
I know, I know. Big, fat, crazy Norn.

36:49.541 --> 36:54.251
Well, since when do we let
strangers control our lives, Dyson?

36:54.338 --> 36:55.953
Since when is that you?

36:56.048 --> 36:58.585
Since it's the price I needed
to pay to save your life.

36:58.675 --> 37:03.510
And I am grateful for that. I am.

37:05.015 --> 37:09.384
But she made you stop
feeling what we had, Dyson.

37:09.478 --> 37:11.514
She didn't make me.

37:13.315 --> 37:18.855
| just... I just wanna try again.

37:27.538 --> 37:29.779
I don't. Please.

37:29.873 --> 37:35.243
Dyson, that is not you talking!
I can make you, you know.

37:35.337 --> 37:38.374
I can make you love me.

37:45.347 --> 37:48.134
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

37:48.225 --> 37:51.183
No, I'm sorry.

37:51.270 --> 37:54.979
Bo, the last thing I wanted
to do was hurt you.

37:55.065 --> 38:00.105
But you have got to move on.
Because I already have.

38:07.911 --> 38:09.993
[THE BLACKHORN] Well, I think
that all went quite nicely,

38:10.080 --> 38:13.288
all things considered. Don't you?

38:13.375 --> 38:17.914
I'm sure the experience provided you
with some valuable insight about Bo.

38:18.005 --> 38:19.461
And who among us protect her.

38:19.548 --> 38:25.794
Really? I suppose you're right.
Still, it was all very clever.

38:25.888 --> 38:28.971
Nothing in the rules about bringing
the stag back from the dead.

38:29.057 --> 38:32.641
Obvious question--
after 80 years in prison,

38:32.728 --> 38:37.722
how did the stag know who Bo was,
let alone where to find her?

38:37.816 --> 38:40.273
I may have had something
mentioned to the girl in passing

38:40.360 --> 38:45.445
and enabled her escape.
Who remembers?

38:45.532 --> 38:49.116
Well, I still find it hard to believe
that you travelled all this way

38:49.203 --> 38:53.242
just for a swearing-in ceremony
or a closer look at Bo.

38:53.332 --> 38:55.823
Ahh.

38:55.918 --> 38:58.751
There may have been rumours
tweaking certain higher ears

38:58.837 --> 39:03.251
that you may not be Fitzpatrick,
simple barkeep, at all.

39:03.342 --> 39:07.631
That you may, in fact,
be the Blood King.

39:07.721 --> 39:13.261
I would be happy for those rumours
to cease. It's the stuff of fairytales.

39:13.352 --> 39:15.638
Of course. Of course.

39:15.729 --> 39:18.641
Although, if it were true,

39:18.732 --> 39:22.270
I can tell you that the Council would
find it hard to believe that you're

39:22.361 --> 39:26.900
satisfied with the underwhelming
challenge of tavern-keeper.

39:26.990 --> 39:31.484
Hmm. It's more of a gastropub, really.

39:31.578 --> 39:38.245
You may assure the High Council that
l have no pretentions toward power.

39:38.335 --> 39:40.121
I'm sure they'd be pleased to hear that.

39:40.212 --> 39:43.955
So long as there are no
more efforts to locate Aife.

39:44.049 --> 39:48.292
So, Aife did resurface?

39:48.387 --> 39:50.343
And she's the mother of this Bo, then?

39:50.430 --> 39:52.421
I can't speak to those.

39:52.516 --> 39:57.226
But I imagine I would find my
continued retirement more attractive

39:57.312 --> 40:00.850
if the Council were to agree
to this friendly request.

40:00.941 --> 40:05.310
I'll be sure to mention it
to them upon my return.

40:05.404 --> 40:09.943
And may I say what an
honour it has been.

40:19.501 --> 40:22.038
Bartender, my ass.

40:25.090 --> 40:29.459
[BO] Well, that was supposed
to be a lot more epic.

40:29.553 --> 40:32.920
Thunderbolts were supposed to
go off. Music was supposed to play.

40:33.015 --> 40:36.678
Nakedness. There was
supposed to be nakedness.

40:36.768 --> 40:38.850
[KENZI] Didn't happen, huh?

40:40.689 --> 40:43.601
Mostly, I just made an asshat
outta myself for nothing.

40:43.692 --> 40:45.978
Shut up. You did not.

40:47.529 --> 40:50.612
It's really over.

40:50.699 --> 40:54.032
For good this time.

40:54.119 --> 40:59.409
ljust--| can't understand why
he doesn't want to fight for us?

41:02.544 --> 41:06.537
I think it's the Tim effect.

41:06.632 --> 41:10.295
Who's Tim?

41:10.385 --> 41:13.001
First guy I ever Iurved.

41:14.514 --> 41:20.054
Until I found him with another girl.
Lurving her from behind.

41:20.145 --> 41:23.228
What happened?

41:23.315 --> 41:29.936
Well, eventually, I was ready to
forgive him, to move on, mentally.

41:30.030 --> 41:33.989
But my heart would not frickin' listen.

41:34.076 --> 41:39.912
And I remembered how
great we were, I missed it.

41:39.998 --> 41:46.085
But I just... I couldn't get myself
to feel it again. Even if I tried.

41:46.171 --> 41:50.005
And I think that's what
the Norn did to Dyson.

41:50.092 --> 41:53.710
I think that's the kind of
whammy she put on Dyson's heart

41:53.804 --> 41:57.262
every time he thinks of you.

41:57.349 --> 41:59.465
Except I didn't do anything wrong.

41:59.559 --> 42:01.140
I know.

42:03.939 --> 42:05.520
I know.

42:07.693 --> 42:10.560
Do you know what the irony is here?

42:10.654 --> 42:18.242
I'm a freaking succubus.
I can make any man want me.

42:18.328 --> 42:21.536
But I can't make this one man love me.

42:24.084 --> 42:28.919
Do you want me to beat the snot
out of him? 'Cause I totally will.

42:29.005 --> 42:32.964
He's so girly about that beard. I think
I need to mess it up a little bit.

42:36.054 --> 42:42.721
Whatever he did, Kenzi,
he did it for me.

42:42.811 --> 42:45.143
--Yeah.
--And he...

42:45.230 --> 42:50.099
...he just needs to be friends and...

42:50.193 --> 42:54.357
...I gotta tell him I'm okay with that.

42:54.448 --> 42:57.190
So, you're gonna lie?

42:59.661 --> 43:02.653
Damn right.

43:02.748 --> 43:05.034
Good luck with that.

43:09.796 --> 43:15.007
Another pint? Vanilla this time, I know.

43:15.093 --> 43:16.549
Yeah.
