WEBVTT

00:04.640 --> 00:07.060
And...

00:08.396 --> 00:09.647
fetch.

00:13.611 --> 00:15.614
I'll explain it once more.

00:15.698 --> 00:17.617
Now when I throw the ball,

00:17.701 --> 00:20.872
this is the ball,
see, made of rubber, round.
Right, that's the ball.

00:20.955 --> 00:24.042
When I throw it over there,
you run after it, pick it up,
bring it back to me.

00:24.126 --> 00:27.673
All right? It's quite simple.
All right. And...

00:29.216 --> 00:30.635
fetch.

00:33.431 --> 00:36.310
You see,
fetching is what dogs do.

00:36.393 --> 00:40.274
It's a service
performed by Canis familiaris,
that's the Latin for dog.

00:40.357 --> 00:44.654
It's what you do, um, you've
always done, since all of us
lived in caves together.

00:44.738 --> 00:49.495
It's quite simple.
You don't have to think
about it, just do it. Do it.

00:50.080 --> 00:51.915
(WHINING)

00:54.168 --> 00:56.171
And...

00:56.254 --> 00:57.715
fetch.

01:02.722 --> 01:04.388
I can see you're
going to be trouble.

01:04.473 --> 01:05.559
(WHINING)

02:16.742 --> 02:19.120
(TYRES SCREECHING)

02:24.544 --> 02:27.758
Well, I think we
should tell them, don't you?

02:27.841 --> 02:31.596
Well, at the moment it's...
It's just us, you know.

02:31.679 --> 02:33.599
It doesn't
belong to anyone else.

02:33.682 --> 02:35.811
(GIGGLING) I like that.

02:35.894 --> 02:38.856
Yeah, but, well, I want
the whole world to know.

02:39.857 --> 02:41.944
How do you think
they'll take it?

02:42.027 --> 02:44.697
They'll be thrilled to bits.
How could they not be?

02:47.409 --> 02:48.787
(SIGHING) Okay.

02:51.541 --> 02:53.252
Let's do it.

02:53.335 --> 02:55.380
(MUFFLED) Now,
once you're like that,

02:55.463 --> 02:59.218
you've got to walk, right?
And then you
drop it like that.

02:59.301 --> 03:02.013
All right? Did you get that?

03:02.471 --> 03:04.308
Hector.

03:04.392 --> 03:07.897
Come inside. Archie's got
some sort of
announcement to make.

03:07.981 --> 03:10.985
(MUFFLED) In a minute.

03:11.068 --> 03:15.324
Now, once you've got
it like that, right,
and you drop it like that.

03:19.163 --> 03:21.833
Well, at least I've
solved the problem
of what to call you.

03:21.916 --> 03:24.211
Come on then, Useless.

03:29.593 --> 03:31.722
Archie, I hope this is
not going to take too long.

03:31.805 --> 03:33.808
I've got that map to
pick up from the library.

03:33.892 --> 03:36.687
Archie,
darling, I promised to give
a talk to the Golf Club ladies

03:36.770 --> 03:38.857
on new approach to
sand wedge design.

03:38.940 --> 03:40.776
And I'm going
fishing with Useless.

03:40.860 --> 03:43.822
And I've got something
really
important to do as well.

03:43.906 --> 03:46.117
Can't remember...
It's quite important.

03:46.201 --> 03:48.245
Well, it shouldn't take
too long, should it, Lex?

03:48.329 --> 03:50.999
-To say just seven words.
-Well, eight.

03:51.082 --> 03:52.585
What?

03:52.668 --> 03:53.836
(HORN HONKING)

03:53.920 --> 03:56.215
ARCHIE: The thing is...
MOLLY: It can't be.

03:56.298 --> 04:00.095
It can't... It is! It's Jo.

04:00.179 --> 04:02.891
-Hector, it's Jo!
-Hell.

04:05.978 --> 04:07.940
Will you excuse me?

04:08.023 --> 04:11.778
It's just that there's
something more interesting
happening outside.

04:13.489 --> 04:16.910
Lexie and I are
going to get married.

04:16.993 --> 04:19.079
Yeah, you're right,
it is eight words.

04:19.163 --> 04:20.457
MOLLY: Jo?

04:21.250 --> 04:22.334
Jo!

04:23.503 --> 04:25.130
(LAUGHING) Jo!

04:25.213 --> 04:29.010
-Hello.
-Oh, my lovely, lovely Jo.

04:29.094 --> 04:31.264
Ah, sweet, sweet sister.

04:31.347 --> 04:36.104
Oh, it is wonderful to
see you. I can't believe it.
Can you, Hector?

04:36.187 --> 04:38.607
-Unbelievable.
-Hello, What The Hec.

04:38.691 --> 04:42.822
Oh, still got the jerk in
the casting arm, have we?

04:42.905 --> 04:45.909
-Who is it?
-It's my Uncle Jolyon.

04:45.993 --> 04:48.746
Fresh from
the hills of East Africa
by the looks of things.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.250
MOLLY: What are you doing
here? You haven't
been back in years.

04:51.333 --> 04:52.836
No, decades.

04:52.919 --> 04:56.382
Come to see you, dear heart.
What else?

04:56.465 --> 05:00.972
-Can't be. Archibald.
-Uncle Jo, welcome.

05:01.055 --> 05:03.809
Actually, you've come
at a very good time.
I'd like you to meet...

05:03.893 --> 05:05.854
Could you be careful
of those, young lad?

05:05.937 --> 05:08.941
-Let me take that for you.
-Oh, thank you.

05:09.025 --> 05:12.906
Very interesting uniforms
your staff wear these days.

05:24.004 --> 05:27.175
My butler was Moses Elijah.

05:27.258 --> 05:31.431
(LAUGHING) He nursed me
when I had Omdurman tummy.

05:31.515 --> 05:37.064
Protected me
from rogue merchants
and rogue elephants.

05:37.147 --> 05:40.903
No, thanks,
my sweet, I'm not hungry.
But, Hector, I'm...

05:42.404 --> 05:44.658
-I'm a bit thirsty.
-You always were, Jolyon.

05:44.741 --> 05:47.203
That is my profound
recollection of you.

05:47.286 --> 05:49.998
Speaking of servants, Molly,

05:50.083 --> 05:54.880
why is it that your staff
appears to be
taking luncheon with us?

05:54.964 --> 05:57.552
(SOFTLY) Jo,
they're our friends.

05:57.635 --> 06:01.390
This is Golly,
Duncan and Lexie.

06:02.850 --> 06:04.978
How extraordinary.

06:05.062 --> 06:06.689
-You staying long, Jolyon?
-Hector.

06:06.772 --> 06:08.900
I don't like to think of his
plantations going to wreck

06:08.984 --> 06:10.945
and ruin in his
absence, that's all.

06:11.028 --> 06:13.240
They're about as big
as Luxembourg, are they?

06:13.323 --> 06:16.202
-Well, it's Denmark, actually.
-Ah.

06:16.286 --> 06:19.540
The chap should come home
and see his loved
ones quite often.

06:19.623 --> 06:24.672
I can give Archie here a bit
of help seeing as you've
been put out to grass.

06:24.755 --> 06:26.592
Thank you very much.

06:26.675 --> 06:31.473
Oh, how pleasant it is to be
in the capacious
bosom of one's family.

06:31.557 --> 06:35.855
(CLEARING THROAT)
Erm, I've actually
got a toast myself,

06:35.938 --> 06:40.111
concerning the capacious
whatsit of one's family.

06:41.279 --> 06:42.573
Erm...

06:43.991 --> 06:47.245
Lexie and I are...are
going to be married.

06:50.125 --> 06:52.377
Here's my
engagement ring to prove it.

07:02.474 --> 07:05.146
Well, isn't this where
you're all supposed to say...

07:05.230 --> 07:08.609
"Congratulations.
I hope you'll
both be very happy."

07:09.151 --> 07:10.487
Erm...

07:13.407 --> 07:14.825
You're joking, aren't you?

07:14.909 --> 07:17.914
Oh, darlings,
darlings, this is...

07:17.997 --> 07:22.545
What, son and heir
marrying the housemaid?

07:22.629 --> 07:27.301
Please, Lexie's my fiancee,
and a very good
friend to everyone here.

07:31.683 --> 07:33.811
Well, Father?

07:36.356 --> 07:39.151
Archie, Lexie, this is...

07:39.235 --> 07:42.699
It's a grave mistake I
fear can only end in tears.

07:44.534 --> 07:46.495
Well, thanks.

07:46.579 --> 07:48.957
Thanks very much, all of you.

07:49.040 --> 07:51.794
Can I just say,
you can stuff your lunch?

07:51.877 --> 07:54.630
I'll just go back to
the kitchen where I belong.

07:54.715 --> 07:56.593
(LEXIE WEEPING)

08:17.455 --> 08:20.043
Oh, what a disaster.

08:20.126 --> 08:21.586
Come on, it needn't be.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.589
Your uncle thought
it was preposterous,

08:23.672 --> 08:26.092
your dad thought
it was
an affrontage to his lineage.

08:26.176 --> 08:28.054
Just you leave them to me.

08:28.137 --> 08:32.183
Duncan thought it was a joke.
And Golly was silent,
even by his standards.

08:32.267 --> 08:35.981
-And, oh, God, even your mum.
-The only thing that
matters is how we feel.

08:36.065 --> 08:39.402
-What other people
think isn't important.
-Oh, really?

08:39.486 --> 08:41.238
What, your family?

08:41.322 --> 08:45.578
The only real family
that I've ever had?
Our friends?

08:46.746 --> 08:48.707
I don't think so, Arch.

08:56.842 --> 08:59.806
-Hector.
Hector, I am appalled.
-So am I.

08:59.889 --> 09:02.433
At your behaviour.
What on earth
were you thinking of?

09:02.519 --> 09:04.562
-Our boy and Lexie, too.
-Fiddlesticks.

09:04.646 --> 09:07.818
You've got the manners of
a warthog and the sensitivity
of Arthur's Seat.

09:07.901 --> 09:10.113
I sometimes wonder
what on earth possessed me

09:10.196 --> 09:12.448
to hitch my wagon to
your broken-down old train.

09:12.533 --> 09:14.743
I refuse to be insulted
in the hallway
of my own house.

09:14.827 --> 09:17.414
Would you rather be insulted
in the hallway of
someone else's house?

09:17.497 --> 09:19.750
-That can easily be arranged.
-I'm going fishing.

09:19.834 --> 09:22.004
-What a capital idea.
-Come on, Useless.

09:23.089 --> 09:26.218
-Coming.
-Not you...

09:26.302 --> 09:28.596
(SIGHING) Oh, forget it.

to lose the blighter.

I shot him up at
Murchison Falls.

I was standing behind
a baobab tree at the time...

10:00.808 --> 10:04.021
Have you any idea of
the grief I'm going to get

10:04.104 --> 10:08.194
when this goes round
headquarters, you maniac?

10:08.277 --> 10:13.785
Look, Dogberry,
don't take that
high-handed tone with me.

10:13.868 --> 10:17.707
You've asked for it.
You're coming down to
the station with me.

10:17.791 --> 10:20.878

er, a quiet word in your ear.

10:20.961 --> 10:24.549
Um, this chap is
Molly's brother, Jolyon.

10:24.633 --> 10:26.678
He's been in
Africa about 40 years.

10:26.761 --> 10:30.225
Rich as Croesus but not
quite used to our ways.

10:30.308 --> 10:32.728
Unlike you, Mr MacDonald, eh?

10:35.440 --> 10:39.696
(STUTTERING) He's
a bit of a dinosaur
but basically quite harmless.

10:39.779 --> 10:42.575
I can vouch for
his good behaviour.
Is that all right?

over to Uganda, you know,

Wow.

Afternoon. You giving
your poor little trout
a fit of the giggles, Hector?

11:20.462 --> 11:22.590
They'll be laughing so
much at your casting,

11:22.673 --> 11:26.303

out of the water with a pair
of eyebrow tweezers.

shall we?

11:34.356 --> 11:37.109
What's he doing
lurking around my loch?

11:37.193 --> 11:38.779
So what...

11:38.862 --> 11:43.494
What specimen of muddy puddle
do we have here, Hector?

11:43.577 --> 11:47.917

compared with what
you're used to, Mr Jo.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.627
What do you know
about it, Duncan?

11:49.710 --> 11:52.507
You couldn't catch raindrops
in an upturned umbrella.

11:52.590 --> 11:55.636
The beasts in this loch,
they aren't like
those bloated things

11:55.719 --> 11:57.806
that flop into your nets
in the tropics, Jolyon.

11:57.889 --> 12:01.852

and sinew and sheer Scots
bloody-mindedness.

trout in the British Isles.

12:05.900 --> 12:07.903
-Ah.
-Let battle commence!

12:10.990 --> 12:13.035
I've been thinking...

12:13.119 --> 12:15.956
So have I. About patricide.

12:17.290 --> 12:20.129
I know. I could kill him, too.

12:23.049 --> 12:27.221
But all that's a waste of
time. We just have to do
what's right for us.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.018

If people here
can't accept the fact
that we love each other

12:32.896 --> 12:36.109
and we want to get married,
then we'll just have
to do it somewhere else.

What, run away, you mean?
Gretna Green or something?

12:40.699 --> 12:42.702
Look, I know it's
not what we planned.

the fairy-tale castle.

12:45.748 --> 12:46.874
No.

12:48.918 --> 12:54.134
But you're right. And
that's just a load of fluff.

12:54.217 --> 12:59.266
We could get married
on the Forth Road Bridge
and I wouldn't care,

12:59.349 --> 13:01.144
as long as we're together.

as to pack up the gear?

this evening's sport.

the most remarkable quality.

we need. We'll make a start
first thing in the morning.

14:46.166 --> 14:48.586
Yeah. Give
the bride a wee surprise.

14:48.669 --> 14:52.299
(SECRET LOVE
PLAYING ON STEREO)

14:58.600 --> 15:02.105
What are you doing, Duncan?

15:02.188 --> 15:07.112
Oh, hi, Mr Jo.
Molly told me to put
your stuff in here, so...

15:08.114 --> 15:09.740
Check this out.

15:09.824 --> 15:12.995
The music scene must have been
really rubbish
in the '70s, yeah?

15:13.079 --> 15:15.040
1961.

15:15.124 --> 15:18.670
That's before you
were born, Duncan,
and I was a heartless lout.

15:23.927 --> 15:27.098
I haven't heard this in years.

15:27.181 --> 15:29.435
This was my Mary's
favourite record.

15:30.562 --> 15:32.606
This is fantastic.

15:32.690 --> 15:36.486
Did you bag that yourself?

15:36.570 --> 15:40.534
Well, for 30 years I
shot everything that moved.

15:40.617 --> 15:43.288
Everything from water
buffalo to sacred ibis.

15:43.371 --> 15:45.458
Yeah.

15:45.541 --> 15:47.084
Do you know, young man,

15:47.168 --> 15:51.132
it's a beautiful paradox
that the closer one
moves towards death,

15:51.215 --> 15:54.720
the more one sees
the preciousness of life.

15:54.803 --> 15:57.516
Last animal I
shot was a leopard,

15:57.600 --> 16:00.645
and when I saw him
crumpled on the ground,

16:00.729 --> 16:04.358
I felt a great sense
of grief and shame.

16:05.694 --> 16:07.947
I haven't picked
up a rifle since.

16:09.741 --> 16:12.704
-Don't be sad, Mr Jo.
-No.

16:12.788 --> 16:15.082
Well,
just for a little while, eh?

16:16.042 --> 16:17.836
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

16:17.920 --> 16:21.132
MOLLY: Lexie? Are you there?

16:21.216 --> 16:24.512
I've got something
that might interest you.

16:24.595 --> 16:28.309
I'll just put it
under the door, shall I?
Leave you to it.

16:29.268 --> 16:30.604
Night-night.

16:37.404 --> 16:41.410
Oh, full of handy hints
for the perfect wedding.

16:41.494 --> 16:44.289
I won't say that I know
that you'll be very happy

16:44.373 --> 16:48.838
because nowadays, well,
it's said more in
hope than expectation.

16:48.921 --> 16:50.715
But you and
Archie are different.

16:50.799 --> 16:52.718
I know you'll
give each other joy

16:52.802 --> 16:56.348
and I'm very happy
to have you as my
daughter-in-law.

16:56.431 --> 17:00.187
I'd have said
the same to Archie,
but I can't find him.

17:00.271 --> 17:03.358
-What's gonna happen?
-Oh, it'll blow over,
usually does.

17:03.441 --> 17:06.487
Hector'll come home,
happy as a sandboy,
satchel full of dead fish

17:06.570 --> 17:09.782
and bless your union.
Oh, Lexie.

17:09.867 --> 17:14.248
Oh, by the way, there's a
lovely pattern for a
going-away dress, page 83.

17:21.467 --> 17:25.181
Father,
I want a word with you.

17:25.263 --> 17:26.598
Must you?

17:26.682 --> 17:29.436
I want an explanation
for your
behaviour this morning.

17:29.519 --> 17:31.272
-I'm sorry, I'm rather tired.
-Now.

17:31.355 --> 17:33.609
-And upset.
-You're upset?

17:33.692 --> 17:36.821
How do you think Lexie
and I feel? What Jolyon said
was bad enough.

17:36.905 --> 17:38.616
You won't be
criticising him, I take it?

17:38.699 --> 17:41.161
You stand in line
to inherit a fortune
from that old devil.

17:41.244 --> 17:45.375
I don't give a monkey's about
inheritances from you, from
Jolyon or the Queen of Sheba.

17:45.459 --> 17:49.214
All I care about right now
is Lexie. You made her cry.
Do you know that?

17:49.297 --> 17:52.677
I'm truly sorry for that,
but I had good reasons
for what I said, believe me.

17:52.761 --> 17:56.473
-Well, such as?
-I can't answer that.

17:56.557 --> 17:59.686
They involve another person.
They must remain private.

17:59.770 --> 18:02.023
Father, that's not good
enough, do you hear me?

18:02.106 --> 18:04.068
Archie, don't shout,
there's a good fellow.

18:04.151 --> 18:08.366
Lexie and I are gonna be
married whether you like
it or not. Do you understand?

18:08.448 --> 18:09.867
Arch...

18:11.203 --> 18:12.580
Hell.

18:12.664 --> 18:15.292
Well, that was quite
a bombshell we had today.

18:16.043 --> 18:19.464
Terrible. Tragic.

18:19.548 --> 18:22.803
-You think so?
-Oh, aye, like Hector says.

18:22.886 --> 18:26.808
-You agree with Hector?
-Aye.

18:26.891 --> 18:30.063
That loch had some
of the best fishing
in the Highlands.

18:30.146 --> 18:32.357
I'm talking about
Archie and Lexie, son.

18:32.440 --> 18:35.320
Oh. Ohhh.

18:35.404 --> 18:38.616
Aye. So, what do you think?

18:38.700 --> 18:41.996
You were quite
sweet on Lexie yourself,
were you not?

18:42.079 --> 18:43.373
-Me?
-Aye.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.042
No.

18:45.126 --> 18:49.298
No, you've got the wrong end
of the stick there, Golly.

18:49.381 --> 18:54.555
I mean, she's all right, but I
never really fancied her,
you know what I mean?

18:55.640 --> 18:57.602
Not physically anyway.

18:58.978 --> 19:04.027
You slippery,
slimy, belly-wriggling worm.

19:04.903 --> 19:06.822
Hi, Lexie. All right?

19:06.906 --> 19:09.993
-Ah, don't smile, son.
-Aye, just dandy, Dunc.

19:10.077 --> 19:12.831
All the better for hearing
the pearls of your wisdom.

19:12.915 --> 19:16.878
Oh, that. Just my little joke.

19:16.961 --> 19:19.924
Well, lucky for you that
I can take one then, eh?

19:23.304 --> 19:26.350
See, I came down here
maybe to chill
out with my mates.

19:26.433 --> 19:29.646
You know? Tell them
about my exciting new plans.

19:29.729 --> 19:31.398
And what did I get?

19:33.026 --> 19:34.903
The second
betrayal of the day.

19:34.986 --> 19:38.825
-Listen, Lexie...
-No, I'm not
talking to you just now.

19:38.909 --> 19:42.080
I'm dealing with the organ
grinder's monkey here.

19:43.958 --> 19:45.710
You and me are finished.

20:01.774 --> 20:04.111
Now, Golly, this
won't do at all, you know.

20:04.194 --> 20:07.741
We stood on that bank for four
hours without the slightest
intimation of a trout.

20:07.825 --> 20:09.493
Yeah, so Duncan said.

20:09.577 --> 20:11.830
I can only conclude
that your defences
have been breached.

20:11.913 --> 20:14.000
-How do you mean?
-It's obvious, isn't it?

20:14.083 --> 20:16.128
The poachers have come in
and hoovered up the lot.

20:16.211 --> 20:19.048
And don't you think
your highly-experienced
gillie would have noticed?

20:19.132 --> 20:20.759
Well, what else could it be?

20:20.843 --> 20:23.305
Well, I wouldn't want you
to take this amiss, Hector,

20:23.388 --> 20:27.310
but maybe the fault
is not with the fish
but with the fishermen.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.563
I see.

20:29.646 --> 20:32.818
Golly, I know you have
a poor opinion of my prowess.

20:33.569 --> 20:35.947
It cuts me deep

20:36.031 --> 20:39.368
but it's only one of
many crosses I have to bear.

20:41.413 --> 20:44.500
I only hope that in the future

20:44.584 --> 20:47.881
you and others will
not judge me so harshly.

20:47.964 --> 20:50.426
I can't come with you, Hector.

20:50.509 --> 20:53.680
Archie's got me on
a three-line whip,
but take this.

20:53.764 --> 20:57.268
If there are
fish in that loch,
and I'm damn sure there are,

20:57.352 --> 20:59.730
then you'll
catch them with that.

20:59.813 --> 21:01.775
As Duncan says,

21:01.858 --> 21:07.115
it'll be as easy as pulling
at a grab-a-granny
night in a disco in Wick.

21:07.199 --> 21:10.913
I'm baffled by the allusion
but I thank you all the same.

21:16.003 --> 21:20.718
Of course I'm sad not to
be there, but you must do
what's right for you.

21:20.802 --> 21:23.889
So, something quiet,

21:23.973 --> 21:26.643
something not too far away.

21:26.726 --> 21:31.358
And maybe something by the sea
so we can hear the waves
breaking on the shore.

21:31.441 --> 21:33.945
-Such a romantic.
-And you're not?

21:34.028 --> 21:36.740
Not an easy thing to be
when you're married to Hector.

21:36.824 --> 21:38.702
Didn't even have a honeymoon.

21:38.785 --> 21:42.248
To be fair, he planned one
but then there
was a crisis here.

21:42.331 --> 21:46.421
-Typical.
-We were going
to have one later

21:46.504 --> 21:50.343
but it was
overtaken by a crisis
of quite a different order.

21:50.427 --> 21:55.225
-Oh?
-There.
What do you think of that?

21:55.309 --> 21:58.938
Oh, Molly, that looks
fantastic. Oh, look!

21:59.022 --> 22:00.316
-Aw.
-Aw.

22:06.866 --> 22:10.872
-We'll make
a start down there, okay?
-Okay, fine.

22:10.955 --> 22:13.000
How did you get on last
night with the old fella?

22:13.083 --> 22:16.254
Oh, don't ask.
I've had enough.
I wash my hands of him.

22:16.338 --> 22:19.884
You think it's gonna
be as easy as that?
He's your father.

22:19.967 --> 22:23.222
Let's get going, shall we?
Have you got
everything we need?

about
the forthcoming nuptials.

My heartiest congratulations.

23:35.907 --> 23:37.869
-Snake in the grass.
-What?

23:37.952 --> 23:42.207
I have come across some
slippery, malevolent creatures
in my time, Kilwillie,

23:42.291 --> 23:45.755
but you are
the Madagascan puff adder
to top the lot of them!

23:45.838 --> 23:49.009
Hector,
I haven't the faintest idea
what you're banging on about.

23:49.092 --> 23:53.015
You couldn't bear it, could
you, that I had a better
fishing ground than you.

23:53.098 --> 23:57.062
So you destroyed it
with a nauseous
touch of casual cruelty.

23:57.145 --> 24:01.068
What fishing ground? You're
not talking about the Loch of
the Two Otters, are you?

24:01.151 --> 24:05.616
You put a pike in there.
A monster.
Ate all my trout.

24:05.699 --> 24:08.078
Now, Hector,
I did not do this thing.

on Badger's life.

-Enormous.

24:14.002 --> 24:16.172
Probably the biggest
pike in the British Isles.

24:16.255 --> 24:19.343
Probably the biggest pike
in the history of, well, pike.

24:19.426 --> 24:21.638
-Really?
-Yes.

24:21.721 --> 24:25.102
-Well, well.
-Yes. Well.

-I've got
an important appointment.
-Me, too.

tackled you downstairs,
you wouldn't talk to me.

This is a rod.

28:41.960 --> 28:46.592
McIntyre. Maybe not for
too long. Duncan,
go and get the phone book.

28:48.804 --> 28:50.223
Ow. Ow.

28:51.808 --> 28:54.853
I've looked up
the British record for pike.

28:54.937 --> 28:58.109
Biggest one's 54 pounds.
A mere tiddler
compared to ours.

28:58.192 --> 29:00.153
I suppose we're sure
it really is a fish?

29:00.237 --> 29:04.117
What do you think
pulled me into the water?
A missing Soviet submarine?

29:04.200 --> 29:06.203
Well,
come on, any bright ideas?

29:06.286 --> 29:09.249
I'm directing every
particle of brain power
at the problem.

29:09.332 --> 29:11.544
Mmm, very reassuring.

29:11.627 --> 29:14.840
The question is, how do
you catch a pike this big?

29:14.923 --> 29:18.554
It's too much for my
Jardine snap-tackle.

29:18.637 --> 29:20.098
What is all this stuff?

29:20.181 --> 29:22.810
It's Jolyon's rubbish he
brought back from Africa.

29:24.770 --> 29:28.818
-Oh.
-Oh, good Lord.
I say, very smart.

29:31.780 --> 29:34.284
Oh, yeah. Oh, careful. Oh!

29:34.367 --> 29:36.412
(LAUGHING) Well done.
Double top.

29:38.039 --> 29:39.332
Ah.

29:40.668 --> 29:42.588
Ah.

29:42.671 --> 29:46.384
Everything all right,
Monsieur Cousteau?

29:46.468 --> 29:49.889
If I see any
suspicious-looking fins,
I'll go like this.

29:49.972 --> 29:52.309
(HUMMING JAWS THEME)

29:53.394 --> 29:56.565
Oh. Oh, Useless. Useless!

29:56.648 --> 29:58.234
(BARKING)

30:07.581 --> 30:10.376
(CONTINUES
BARKING FRANTICALLY)

30:29.945 --> 30:31.114
Useless!

30:35.537 --> 30:38.958
Archie. Archie.

30:39.041 --> 30:42.254
Go on, son, it's getting late.
We'll try again tomorrow.

30:53.436 --> 30:56.107
The description in
the family history
might be a bit hazy,

30:56.190 --> 30:57.860
but
the geological survey wasn't.

30:57.943 --> 31:01.239
-Right here, it said.
-We'll find it.
Don't you worry.

31:05.871 --> 31:07.832
-Here.
-Thanks.

31:11.170 --> 31:13.798
Why is it,
why has it always been,

31:13.882 --> 31:16.594
that I can rely on
you more than my father?

31:16.677 --> 31:19.264
-Go on, son.
-No, it's true.

31:19.347 --> 31:21.767
Whenever I've needed him most,

31:21.851 --> 31:24.813
at a school sports
day or after Jamie died,

31:24.897 --> 31:28.694
or now, to bless my marriage,
the most important
decision in my life,

31:28.777 --> 31:31.448
he somehow
manages to disappear.

31:31.531 --> 31:35.704
I mean, where is he? What's
he doing? What could be more
important than me and Lexie?

31:35.787 --> 31:37.999
And why does he think
we'd be such
a disaster anyway?

31:38.082 --> 31:39.876
I'm sure he
doesn't think that.

31:39.959 --> 31:42.839
-Okay, then why is he...
-Look, Archie...

31:42.923 --> 31:48.138
I can't explain your father,
what drives him,
what makes him tick.

31:48.222 --> 31:50.558
He is what he is.

31:50.642 --> 31:54.605
But this I do know.
He's a very proud father.

31:57.777 --> 32:02.366
Well, that's just it,
isn't it? Someone else has
to tell me that.

32:02.449 --> 32:05.663
I have to hear from you
that my father's proud of me.

32:07.874 --> 32:12.213
It's no good, is it, Golly?
Something has
to be faced here.

32:22.854 --> 32:25.941
-LEXIE: I hope it
all works out for you.
-I won't forget this.

32:26.024 --> 32:28.820
You've been kinder to me
than I have a right to expect.

32:28.903 --> 32:31.907
You have a fine
spirit and a better heart.

33:00.615 --> 33:01.908
Mary?

33:04.620 --> 33:05.955
Mary?

33:08.959 --> 33:12.715
Is it you?
Is it... Is it really you?

33:12.798 --> 33:15.719
-Oh, you look well. I mean...
-Thank you.

33:15.802 --> 33:19.390
I've brought you a present.
It's our song.

33:19.474 --> 33:23.897
I can't tell you what it means
to me to see you after
all these years.

33:23.980 --> 33:27.903
I was such a fool, Mary.
I never forgot you.

33:27.986 --> 33:30.615
I never married, you know.
You were the only one.

33:30.698 --> 33:35.747
No one else could match
your loveliness
and that smile...

33:35.830 --> 33:39.252
I always knew you'd
come back one day.

33:39.335 --> 33:41.547
Well, I'm here,

33:41.630 --> 33:45.719
and perhaps our story
can have a happy
ending after all.

33:45.803 --> 33:50.601
I said to all my friends,
"One of these days he's
going to come for me."

33:50.685 --> 33:55.149
-My Frank!
-Well,
perhaps you and I, we...

33:57.611 --> 34:00.991
-Frank?
-Sing for me, Mr Sinatra?

34:12.047 --> 34:17.013
Aha! First the troublemaker,
now the fugitive.

34:17.096 --> 34:21.978
I've had a call about you.
Something about
a dodgy credit card.

34:23.355 --> 34:26.150
Bank of Kenya, was it, huh?

34:29.405 --> 34:31.867
I'll call round
later for a wee chat.

34:33.453 --> 34:35.371
GOLLY: Now, see your pike,

34:35.456 --> 34:40.295
your pike is
the freshwater equivalent
of the great white shark.

34:40.379 --> 34:45.553
A killing machine.
Lifeless eyes.
Black eyes, like a doll's.

34:47.222 --> 34:49.934
And a wide
mouth and big teeth.

34:50.018 --> 34:53.773
And all it ever thinks
about is how to use them.

34:53.856 --> 34:57.654
Now you put that in the loch
and it'll clean the water
of all swimming things,

34:57.737 --> 35:02.034
perch,
trout, eels, ducks, birds.

35:02.117 --> 35:07.124
I once heard of someone caught
a pike, slit open its
stomach and found a...

35:07.208 --> 35:10.421
-Found a can of
dog food inside.
-How disgusting.

35:10.505 --> 35:13.509
Yeah.
Aye, you rid us of that beast

35:13.592 --> 35:17.305
and you'll be
doing us all a service.
If indeed it really is there.

35:17.389 --> 35:21.353
-Oh, it's there, Golly.
Believe me, it's there.
-Maybe.

35:21.436 --> 35:26.360
Anyway,
good luck and try this bait.

35:26.443 --> 35:29.990
Although sometimes I think
it'd be easier just to blow
a pike out of the water

35:30.074 --> 35:32.578
rather than try and catch
it with a rod and a line.

35:32.661 --> 35:34.121
Good Lord.

35:34.204 --> 35:36.624
Well, beddy-byes, Kilwillie.
Big day tomorrow.

35:36.708 --> 35:40.130
-Right you are, old chap.
Bye, Golly.
-Kilwillie.

35:40.213 --> 35:44.175
What's... What's all this?
That's stuff for
Archie's thing.

35:44.260 --> 35:47.014
Careful, Hector,
that's plastic explosive.

35:47.097 --> 35:51.270
-Good heavens.
He's a boy, isn't he?
-Yes, he is.

35:51.353 --> 35:54.274
And maybe one day
you'll get round
to telling him that.

35:57.737 --> 35:59.197
Good man, Golly.

36:11.924 --> 36:16.972
You wanted to see me?

36:17.055 --> 36:22.228
I'm not sure "want" is quite
the right word. "Need" would
be nearer the mark.

36:22.312 --> 36:25.485
But as ever between you
and me, this is something
that I have to do

36:25.568 --> 36:27.487
and there's no pleasure in it.

36:27.571 --> 36:29.740
You seem rather angry.

36:29.823 --> 36:33.913
Again,
not quite the right word.
I'm actually rather weary.

36:33.996 --> 36:36.708
I'm the old man.
I'm the one who
should be weary.

36:36.792 --> 36:40.047
Could you just stop
talking in riddles
and get to the point?

36:41.548 --> 36:42.801
All right.

36:45.304 --> 36:49.893
When I gathered you all
together yesterday to tell
you about the love of my life,

36:49.977 --> 36:52.898
I...I somehow knew
what would happen.

36:55.193 --> 36:59.699
I knew, ultimately, everyone
else would be thrilled
for me and Lexie.

36:59.782 --> 37:04.414
But I also knew that,
for whatever reason,
you wouldn't.

37:04.497 --> 37:08.545
-Can I just say...
-And that is
exactly how it turned out.

37:08.628 --> 37:11.382
Because that's
the way it's always been,

37:11.465 --> 37:16.055
with me looking for your
endorsement and approval and
never quite getting it.

37:16.139 --> 37:17.683
Does it really
matter what I think?

37:17.766 --> 37:20.478
Did it matter to you
what your father
thought of you?

37:20.562 --> 37:22.480
I suppose it did.

37:22.565 --> 37:25.319
Just for the record,
I was a grave
disappointment to him.

37:25.402 --> 37:28.656
Well,
like all fathers and sons,
we're stuck with each other.

37:28.740 --> 37:31.535
And perhaps I'll
always be a problem to you.

37:31.619 --> 37:34.289
But what I came
here to say was that

37:34.372 --> 37:38.211
I'm just not going to
worry about it any more.

37:38.295 --> 37:40.214
I'm going to
leave that up to you.

37:40.298 --> 37:43.135
I'm 31 years old,
I'm about to get married

37:43.218 --> 37:47.140
and, for better or worse,
I am my own man.
It's time to move on.

37:49.226 --> 37:50.771
Good night, Father.

37:59.032 --> 38:00.660
(DOOR OPENING)

38:00.743 --> 38:01.994
Arch.

38:04.373 --> 38:06.542
-What's wrong?
-Nothing. Nothing, look.

38:06.626 --> 38:10.048
I've found the perfect place
to get married, in Orkney.

38:10.131 --> 38:12.258
Look,
there's this stone circle.

38:12.342 --> 38:17.265
It's 4,000 years old
and overlooks the beach
and the Atlantic shore and...

38:17.349 --> 38:19.644
What's wrong?

38:19.727 --> 38:21.355
Well, I've been thinking.

38:21.438 --> 38:24.275
-Arch,
I wish you wouldn't do that.
-Maybe you were right.

38:24.359 --> 38:28.115
Why should we get
married somewhere else
just because he disapproves?

38:28.198 --> 38:31.327
This is where we live,
this is where our friends are.

38:33.580 --> 38:35.834
-I'm sorry,
but surely you can see...
-No.

38:35.917 --> 38:39.588
What I see is that
you have pushed me
into all of this.

38:39.672 --> 38:42.134
You know,
me and Molly have done
all this groundwork

38:42.217 --> 38:46.932
and I got all excited and
all you do is want to push me
into something else.

38:47.016 --> 38:49.936
Archie, why do you
want to get married?

38:50.021 --> 38:53.483
Is it because you love me
or you want to spite your dad?

38:53.567 --> 38:56.696
Or is it that now
you don't want to
marry me at all?

38:59.325 --> 39:01.619
I'm so sorry.
I was just passing.

39:04.790 --> 39:07.210
Can I just say...

39:09.172 --> 39:10.924
don't make the mistake I made?

39:11.008 --> 39:13.178
I fell in love with
a girl and I ran away

39:13.261 --> 39:16.599
because people said
she wasn't good enough for me.

39:16.682 --> 39:18.977
I've been
lonely my entire life

39:19.061 --> 39:23.776
so don't worry about
what other people say,
children. You just...

39:23.859 --> 39:25.862
You just hang
on to each other.

39:30.327 --> 39:33.331
Arch, what are we gonna do?

39:41.175 --> 39:44.763
GOLLY: Although sometimes I
think it'd be easier just to
blow a pike out of the water

39:44.846 --> 39:47.559
rather than to
try and catch it
with a rod and a line.

40:19.061 --> 40:21.773
Very well. I'll come quietly.

40:26.196 --> 40:29.993
-You went to visit my mother.
-Mary?

40:30.953 --> 40:32.956
What, you're Mary's son?

40:33.040 --> 40:37.838
You told the folk at the home
you were once
her special friend.

40:37.921 --> 40:43.888
-When?
-Summer, 1961.

40:43.971 --> 40:47.643
I was born in
the spring of 1962.

40:49.020 --> 40:50.939
I never had a father.

40:53.359 --> 40:54.861
Till now.

40:58.992 --> 41:00.244
Dad.

41:10.634 --> 41:13.429
-Hector?
-Ah.

41:13.513 --> 41:16.141
-Hector, what are you doing?
-Er, looking for this.

41:16.225 --> 41:18.728
-It belonged to the boy,
you remember?
-Mmm.

41:18.812 --> 41:20.981
-What are you
going to do with it?
-You'll see.

41:21.065 --> 41:23.485
Hector, I haven't
finished with you yet.

41:23.568 --> 41:28.200
This business with Archie and
Lexie. You've upset them
both very much, you know.

41:28.283 --> 41:31.538
I tried telling Archie
that it was
nothing to do with them,

41:31.621 --> 41:33.332
that it was related
to someone else.

41:33.416 --> 41:35.710
Well, who, for
heaven's sakes?

41:35.794 --> 41:40.467
Oh, you're not making much
sense to me or anyone else.
You better sit down.

41:42.261 --> 41:45.182
Well,
you see, it's just that...

41:46.642 --> 41:49.604
Well,
the thing is, it's about you,

41:49.688 --> 41:51.899
-as it always has been.
-Me?

41:51.983 --> 41:54.570
And me. Us. Our marriage.

41:54.653 --> 41:57.407
Well, what about our marriage?

41:57.490 --> 42:02.122
Molly, when I first met you,
you were the loveliest
creature I'd ever seen,

42:02.205 --> 42:04.000
and you still are.

42:04.083 --> 42:06.503
But you weren't
just glamorous,
you were successful, too.

42:06.587 --> 42:09.382
-I was a model, that's all.
-No, no, that's not right.

42:09.466 --> 42:13.597
That Italian chap
wanted you to be in his film.
What was it called, Blow Off?

42:13.680 --> 42:17.644
Blowup. Mr Antonioni.
Blowup.

42:17.728 --> 42:23.152
That's right. But you married
me instead and I brought you
here in the middle of nowhere,

42:23.235 --> 42:26.907
shut you up in
this gloomy old house
like Rapunzel in her tower.

42:26.990 --> 42:30.370
No one saw your beauty but me.

42:30.454 --> 42:33.625
A hopeless character,
not worthy of you at all.

42:33.708 --> 42:36.670
And then you ran away.

42:36.754 --> 42:40.760
Hector, this was a very long
time ago. We haven't spoken
of it for years.

42:40.843 --> 42:44.431
Well, that hasn't stopped me
thinking about
it and wondering.

42:44.515 --> 42:46.434
Wondering?
Wondering about what?

42:46.518 --> 42:49.730
-I came back, didn't I?
-Yes, but you were
pregnant with Jamie.

42:49.814 --> 42:54.028
Perhaps you came back because
of that? A sense of duty.
Not because of...

42:54.112 --> 42:56.281
What has this got to do
with Archie and Lexie?

42:56.365 --> 42:59.786
I just hate
the thought of the dear girl
being imprisoned like you.

42:59.869 --> 43:02.456
Maybe she'll run off too,
but not come back.

43:02.541 --> 43:04.709
Oh, Hector, listen to me.

43:04.793 --> 43:10.385
When I ran off I was young
and foolish and soon realised
what a mistake I'd made.

43:10.468 --> 43:14.974
Since then I have
never looked back.

43:15.058 --> 43:19.647
Yes,
there've been dark moments
in our life together,

43:19.730 --> 43:23.278
but nothing to all the others
that shine in my memory.

43:23.361 --> 43:27.659
I'm content with my husband
and my marriage and my life.

43:29.202 --> 43:30.955
No, more than that.

43:32.624 --> 43:34.209
Deeply content.

43:36.004 --> 43:38.174
-Are you really?
-Of course.

43:40.552 --> 43:42.722
You must go and
explain everything to Archie.

43:42.805 --> 43:44.766
I'll speak to them
both this evening.

43:44.849 --> 43:48.104
Oh, Hector.
Jo's coming to see me.

43:48.188 --> 43:51.734
I love him dearly but, oh!

43:51.817 --> 43:54.070
He's not an easy
house guest, is he?

43:54.154 --> 43:56.199
He does rather
breathe my oxygen, old girl.

43:56.282 --> 43:59.203
But if you want him to
stay, well... What are you
painting, by the way?

43:59.286 --> 44:01.956
You. But you can't see
it yet, it's not finished.

44:02.040 --> 44:03.417
Oh, would you
sit for me, Hector?

44:03.501 --> 44:04.877
I can't, darling.
Going fishing.

44:04.960 --> 44:07.507
-Oh, must you?
-I fear so.

44:07.590 --> 44:12.304
You see, Molly, I learnt
long ago that chaps like me
don't exactly make history,

44:12.387 --> 44:14.724
or even
influence world events.

44:14.808 --> 44:18.438
Once upon a time we
did but not any more.

44:18.522 --> 44:21.192
All that's left
are small battles

44:21.275 --> 44:24.530
and even smaller victories.
Like catching pike.

44:27.242 --> 44:29.203
I love you more than my life.

44:30.497 --> 44:32.165
I'll see you later.

44:47.478 --> 44:50.316
Don't worry,
dear girl, all will be well.

45:02.124 --> 45:07.256
I feel like a boy
from the Lower Remove
summoned to see the beak.

45:09.134 --> 45:12.305
Come and sit, Jo. Here, by me.

45:15.602 --> 45:20.442
Jo, it's been lovely
having you here, but...

45:20.525 --> 45:23.112
-You want me to go?
-No, no, no.

45:23.196 --> 45:26.366
But your visit has
created certain waves

45:26.450 --> 45:30.956
and I was just wondering
when you were
planning to return home.

45:32.709 --> 45:36.005
Well, I can't.
I haven't got a home.

45:36.088 --> 45:39.968
I was kicked out
by the new owner,
a nouveau Kenyan.

45:40.053 --> 45:42.096
He's an importer of
refrigerators.

45:42.180 --> 45:45.268
There's a lot of money
in fridges in the tropics.

45:45.352 --> 45:47.020
What about your money?

45:47.103 --> 45:51.276
All your lands?
Your... Your tea plantations?

45:51.360 --> 45:56.492
Well, I made a foolish,
impetuous and thoroughly
characteristic decision

45:56.575 --> 45:58.662
to grow coffee on them,

45:58.745 --> 46:03.377
and then I spent five years
watching the price drop
as low as my self-esteem.

46:03.460 --> 46:06.548
I lost everything
except you and Archie

46:06.631 --> 46:10.345
and a rather
sentimental police constable
called Callum.

46:13.808 --> 46:16.186
So what are you
going to do now?

46:16.270 --> 46:19.190
Well,
I suppose I'm throwing myself
on your mercy.

46:21.819 --> 46:27.911
Good people.
I could be happy here,
do the odd thing.

46:27.995 --> 46:33.794
-Give young Archie
wise counsel and advice.
-Jo. Dear, Jo.

46:33.878 --> 46:39.051
That would be fine
but don't you see,
that is actually Hector's job?

46:49.691 --> 46:51.027
Golly.

46:52.445 --> 46:53.697
Golly.

46:57.953 --> 47:00.957
-Are you mad?
-Oh, don't fuss.

47:01.041 --> 47:04.587
Plastic explosives?
Have you totally taken
leave of your senses?

47:04.670 --> 47:06.548
I've read the instructions,
for heaven's sake.

47:06.632 --> 47:09.093
Well, I wash my hands of this.
I don't want any part of it.

47:09.177 --> 47:11.222
Kilwillie, are we to
be defeated by a fish?

47:11.305 --> 47:14.434
If this incendiary folly
is the only alternative,
then yes.

47:14.518 --> 47:17.188
You show your true colours.

47:17.271 --> 47:19.733
No spirit, no stomach
for the struggles of life.

47:19.816 --> 47:23.239
Do you know,
sometimes, Hector,
you really are too much!

47:26.493 --> 47:28.663
Right,
Useless, fetch the boat.

47:31.208 --> 47:34.337
Fetch the...
Fe... Oh, I'll do it.

47:44.935 --> 47:46.813
Where have you been?

47:48.482 --> 47:50.318
What's that?

47:50.402 --> 47:54.824
I was, um, reading one
of the family histories
the other day.

47:54.907 --> 47:58.580
Came across this reference
to my great-grandfather

47:58.663 --> 48:01.542
who found some small
quantities up in the river,

48:01.625 --> 48:05.673
round about the same time
they came across some larger
deposits up in Sutherland.

48:05.756 --> 48:08.635
So we went looking
and we found this.

48:10.054 --> 48:13.017
Yeah, but what is it?

48:13.100 --> 48:16.396
Well, it should
just about be enough
for a couple of rings.

48:18.316 --> 48:19.609
Gold?

48:21.153 --> 48:22.906
You found gold?

48:24.741 --> 48:27.621
Lex,
I wanna be with you forever.

48:29.456 --> 48:31.167
I love you more than my life.

48:32.335 --> 48:33.587
Oh, Arch.

48:35.381 --> 48:37.927
HMS Glenbogle, do your worst.

49:09.345 --> 49:12.182
Useless? Useless?

49:20.319 --> 49:21.612
Ah.

49:22.698 --> 49:24.741
(LOUD EXPLOSION)

49:56.870 --> 49:58.539
Archie, son.

49:58.623 --> 50:01.293
Your dad.
It's your dad, Archie.

50:01.376 --> 50:03.087
What's the old fool done now?

50:10.222 --> 50:12.935
KILWILLIE:
(SHOUTING FRANTICALLY)
Molly? Molly?

50:13.018 --> 50:15.688
Kilwillie? What do you want?
