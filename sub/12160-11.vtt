WEBVTT

00:03.610 --> 00:06.479
Wow. What are you working on again?

00:06.546 --> 00:08.314
Oh. Geophysical survey.

00:08.381 --> 00:11.117
I have that presentation.
I'm just, uh, going through

00:11.184 --> 00:13.486
the calibration procedures
for a well bore.

00:13.553 --> 00:14.487
(Chuckles) You know,
when we got married,

00:14.554 --> 00:16.189
I thought I was the smart one.

00:16.256 --> 00:19.492
(Laughing)

00:21.394 --> 00:24.497
(Sighs and chuckles)

00:24.564 --> 00:26.688
It's--it's not <i>that</i> funny.

00:28.468 --> 00:30.236
Hey, guys. Okay, so you know
how I'm always saying

00:30.303 --> 00:32.372
that I want to be a reality TV star?

00:32.439 --> 00:34.441
Yes, with
zero positive reinforcement.

00:34.507 --> 00:37.310
(Singsongy)
Well, I think I'm on my way!

00:37.377 --> 00:38.478
Why? What happened?

00:38.545 --> 00:40.580
There was a fire
in the chem lab at school!

00:40.647 --> 00:42.282
Wow. Was anybody hurt?

00:42.349 --> 00:45.318
Oh, no one important, but, um,
a TV news crew showed up,

00:45.385 --> 00:46.486
and I got to be on camera

00:46.553 --> 00:49.189
looking really, really sad like this.

00:49.255 --> 00:51.324
Dad, look.

00:51.391 --> 00:54.461
(Whispers) Oh, my God.
(Gasps)

00:56.229 --> 00:57.530
Wow, that's great...

00:57.597 --> 00:59.099
Yeah.
That you're passionate

00:59.165 --> 01:02.102
about somethin' that could, uh...

01:02.168 --> 01:03.570
I got nothin'.

01:03.636 --> 01:07.173
(Sighs) Hey, don't worry.
This won't change me.

01:07.240 --> 01:09.442
What a relief.

01:09.509 --> 01:11.277
You know, in the blink of an eye,

01:11.344 --> 01:12.345
she's gonna be out of the house.

01:12.412 --> 01:14.214
How is she gonna support herself?

01:14.280 --> 01:15.215
Honey, I don't think
you have to worry.

01:15.281 --> 01:17.517
She is never moving out.

01:17.584 --> 01:21.287
Yeah. You know, sometimes I
wonder how we ended up with her.

01:21.354 --> 01:22.389
Shall I remind you?

01:23.590 --> 01:26.092
Moody Blues concert,
two bottles of Boone's Farm,

01:26.159 --> 01:28.361
and you said... (Slurring)
"Let's take a bath."

01:28.481 --> 01:29.681
(Mouths words)

01:30.251 --> 01:33.351
Last Man Standing - S01E11
The Passion of the Mandy

01:33.471 --> 01:35.268
Original air date
December 13, 2011

01:35.388 --> 01:38.118
Sync and corrections by Gatto
for www.addic7ed.com

01:38.238 --> 01:40.173
Well, I wasn't on the news,

01:40.240 --> 01:43.276
and I had to watch
the whole thing to find out.

01:43.343 --> 01:45.111
I am so sorry for you.

01:45.178 --> 01:47.280
I'll never get
that time back. (Sighs)

01:48.844 --> 01:50.183
Hey, Eve.
I think I'll be able

01:50.250 --> 01:52.118
to make it to your soccer game today.

01:52.185 --> 01:55.522
That's great, but could you
tone it down just a little bit?

01:55.588 --> 01:57.123
Is this about last week?

01:57.190 --> 01:59.092
Look, I was just being enthusiastic.

01:59.159 --> 02:02.529
"Hey, cork-for-brains,
the ball was out!"

02:02.595 --> 02:04.264
It was all in good fun, honey.

02:04.330 --> 02:06.366
(Chuckles) Dad, the ref ran
off the field in tears.

02:06.433 --> 02:09.202
Well, to--in my defense,
for a dude to cry that quick,

02:09.269 --> 02:11.538
there's something else going on.

02:11.604 --> 02:14.374
Morning, Mr. B.
Here's your paper.

02:14.441 --> 02:17.177
Hey, Kyle. It's awful early
for you to be so happy

02:17.243 --> 02:20.146
in a house you don't <i>live</i> in.

02:20.213 --> 02:22.115
He stopped by to take
me and Boyd to breakfast.

02:22.182 --> 02:24.184
Yeah, I'd take Kristin out
more often, but I, uh--

02:24.250 --> 02:25.485
ahem. I don't earn enough.

02:25.552 --> 02:29.289
Well, maybe because you don't--
ahem, do enough.

02:30.290 --> 02:32.525
So how's my big boy?

02:32.592 --> 02:36.196
Well, somebody taught him
how to say "boobies."

02:36.262 --> 02:39.566
Wh-what? That's outrageous.

02:39.632 --> 02:41.368
You ready to go?

02:41.434 --> 02:42.435
- Yeah.
- All right.

02:42.502 --> 02:44.137
Oh, hey. Can you guys give me
a ride to the mall?

02:44.204 --> 02:45.472
(Laughs) What? I mean school.

02:45.538 --> 02:47.662
Why would I say "mall"?
I'm not going there.

02:49.209 --> 02:50.276
We're out of milk.

02:50.343 --> 02:52.278
I got milk,
three different kinds of milk.

02:52.345 --> 02:54.314
Who needs milk?
'Cause I got it.

02:54.381 --> 02:56.182
I wondered where you went.
(Sighs)

02:56.249 --> 02:58.118
Well, somebody has to do
the grocery shopping.

02:58.184 --> 02:59.185
And that someone would be
me right now.

02:59.252 --> 03:01.187
Honey, you buy the wrong things.

03:01.254 --> 03:03.590
I mean, who needs eight
different kinds of bacon?

03:05.291 --> 03:07.527
Eve, sweetie, you want
to bring down your laundry?

03:07.594 --> 03:09.529
I can throw a load in
before I go to work.

03:09.596 --> 03:11.097
I'll do the laundry.

03:11.164 --> 03:12.399
I don't like the way
you fold the clothes.

03:12.465 --> 03:16.202
(Chuckles) Rolling clothes
takes up a lot less space.

03:16.269 --> 03:18.471
Ask anybody on a submarine.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.308
I appreciate everything
you're doing to help,

03:22.375 --> 03:24.344
but even with this new promotion
and this extra work,

03:24.411 --> 03:26.279
I can still take care of my family.

03:26.346 --> 03:28.281
(Gasps) Oh, my God.
It's 7:40 microwave time.

03:28.348 --> 03:30.350
I am <i>so</i> late!

03:31.518 --> 03:35.121
Why are you in such a hurry?
You're a geologist.

03:35.188 --> 03:38.358
It's not like the rocks
are going anywhere.

03:38.425 --> 03:40.393
I was up all night working
on this presentation.

03:40.460 --> 03:41.561
I'm just--I'm exhausted.

03:41.628 --> 03:43.363
I haven't had a chance
to look over these notes,

03:43.430 --> 03:44.531
but that's okay.
I can do it in the shower.

03:44.597 --> 03:46.399
I'll just put 'em up
against the glass,

03:46.466 --> 03:48.134
and I--and I'll shave
my legs in the car.

03:48.201 --> 03:49.536
No, you know what? Forget it.
I'll just wear pants. Yeah.

03:49.602 --> 03:51.137
- That's fine. That's what I'm gonna do.
- Baby, baby. Calm.

03:51.204 --> 03:52.305
- Relax a little bit.
- (Sighs) I can't.

03:52.372 --> 03:53.540
I know this promotion's put
a lot of pressure on you,

03:53.606 --> 03:55.442
but you gotta let it go
here at home...

03:55.508 --> 03:56.543
(Sighs)

03:56.609 --> 04:00.347
And...
You gotta shave them sticks.

04:00.413 --> 04:03.149
Are they that bad?

04:03.216 --> 04:05.518
It's like sleeping
with a Christmas tree.

04:09.356 --> 04:11.191
Hey. Morning, guys.
Morning, Ed.

04:11.257 --> 04:12.325
(Groans) You're here awful early.

04:12.392 --> 04:16.196
Mike, part of me is dying.
(Sighs)

04:16.262 --> 04:19.332
Didn't I tell you?
Just have that thing removed.

04:19.399 --> 04:20.567
I'm not talking about that,

04:20.632 --> 04:22.402
which, by the way, fell off
on its own, you know?

04:22.469 --> 04:25.472
I'm talking about
Murphy's barbershop.

04:25.538 --> 04:27.307
It's closing down.

04:27.374 --> 04:28.541
That's terrible, Ed.

04:28.608 --> 04:31.444
(Chuckles) But I gotta say,
it's not a big surprise.

04:31.511 --> 04:33.480
Oh? I'm surprised.
It was--it was doing

04:33.546 --> 04:35.382
- a solid business.
- Solid business?

04:35.448 --> 04:38.118
You remember the last time
you and I went there?

04:38.184 --> 04:40.353
(Snoring)

04:42.455 --> 04:44.424
(Lowered voice) Should we come back?

04:44.491 --> 04:47.193
We should see if he's breathing.

04:47.260 --> 04:48.361
Well, maybe you're right.

04:48.428 --> 04:50.563
The crowds have been thinning
the past couple of years.

04:50.630 --> 04:51.564
Speaking of thinning--

04:51.631 --> 04:54.401
don't go there, Mike, all right?

04:54.467 --> 04:56.102
I know it's terrible, man.
It's like your man cave.

04:56.169 --> 04:57.270
Everybody needs one.

04:57.337 --> 04:58.538
Uh, morning, Ed.

04:58.605 --> 05:01.274
Hi. The rug guy is here
to clean the animal heads.

05:01.341 --> 05:02.542
Hey, Kyle.
Do you have a man cave?

05:02.609 --> 05:04.444
My van.

05:04.511 --> 05:07.180
The one place where people
aren't all up in my business.

05:07.247 --> 05:08.515
You have no idea how tiring it is.

05:08.581 --> 05:10.350
"Kyle, do this." "Kyle, do that."

05:10.417 --> 05:13.319
"Kyle, for God sake,
get your act together!"

05:13.386 --> 05:14.521
I don't do that.

05:14.587 --> 05:16.589
Your daughter does.

05:20.226 --> 05:22.595
Well, good luck with that, Kyle!

05:24.264 --> 05:26.366
(Monotone voice) And now in a moment,

05:26.433 --> 05:30.103
we'll hear from Vanessa and her team,

05:30.170 --> 05:34.107
but first let's review
the field studies

05:34.174 --> 05:36.242
from the previous year.

05:36.309 --> 05:38.445
As we all know,

05:38.511 --> 05:44.351
the results were disappointing
in the first calendar year,

05:44.417 --> 05:49.389
but by implementing
the new Geo software,

05:49.456 --> 05:52.158
we discovered that the soil samples

05:52.225 --> 05:59.366
in areas two, five, and seven
were very promising.

05:59.432 --> 06:04.471
That's the good news. However,
statistically speaking...

06:04.537 --> 06:07.273
(Voice echoing) There may be
diminishing returns

06:07.340 --> 06:10.110
in continuing to exploit the reserves

06:10.176 --> 06:12.278
in the upper basin area...

06:12.345 --> 06:14.347
(Continues indistinctly)

06:14.414 --> 06:16.249
(Thud)

06:18.518 --> 06:22.355
Perhaps we'll take a short break.

06:27.529 --> 06:28.813
Hi. Mike Baxter here.

06:28.933 --> 06:30.208
One of the most overlooked aspects

06:30.328 --> 06:32.600
of a successful hunting trip
is proper camouflage.

06:32.666 --> 06:34.268
Now I got two guys back here

06:34.335 --> 06:36.203
in two different kinds of camouflage.

06:36.270 --> 06:40.174
With that background, which guy
is gonna surprise the deer?

06:40.241 --> 06:42.176
See ya, Sid.

06:42.243 --> 06:43.544
But deer have a sense of smell, too.

06:43.611 --> 06:46.280
That's why it's important
to coat that camouflage

06:46.347 --> 06:47.448
with spray...
(Spritzing)

06:47.515 --> 06:50.184
Deer urine.

06:50.251 --> 06:51.652
Spray it on there--

06:51.719 --> 06:54.188
I asked you to shut your eyes.
Did you shut your eyes?

06:54.255 --> 06:57.491
I told you to shut your eyes.

06:57.558 --> 06:59.293
(Chuckles)

06:59.360 --> 07:00.294
- Hey.
- Hi, dad.

07:00.361 --> 07:01.562
Hey, Mandy.
Why don't we take five?

07:01.629 --> 07:03.197
Take him downstairs
and wash his eyes out.

07:03.264 --> 07:06.267
That stuff will burn
the skin off a snake!

07:06.333 --> 07:07.435
Hey. What's up?

07:07.501 --> 07:09.270
I think there's something
wrong with my car.

07:09.336 --> 07:10.538
- What's it doing?
- Um, there's this sound,

07:10.604 --> 07:13.574
and then another sound,
followed by a third sound.

07:13.641 --> 07:17.244
Well... that certainly
narrows it down.

07:17.311 --> 07:19.280
- Come take a look for me?
- Yeah, let me get my jacket.

07:19.347 --> 07:20.348
(Whispers) Okay.
Hold on.

07:21.515 --> 07:22.516
Try to describe the sound you heard.

07:22.583 --> 07:23.617
Okay, first it's, like, a...

07:23.684 --> 07:24.618
(High-pitched voice)
Chicka, chicka, chicka!

07:24.685 --> 07:25.619
(Deep voice) Bing!

07:25.686 --> 07:27.288
(Normal voice) And then sort of a...

07:27.355 --> 07:28.289
(Deep voice) Thoonk-thoonk,
thoonk-thoonk, thoonk-thoonk,

07:28.356 --> 07:29.290
thoonk-thoonk!

07:29.357 --> 07:30.291
(Normal voice) And then, like, a...

07:30.358 --> 07:33.294
(Deep voice) Fuh-thoomp, fuh-thoomp!

07:33.361 --> 07:35.363
Oh, now I know what it is.

07:35.429 --> 07:37.431
Murphy's barbershop?
I know this place.

07:37.498 --> 07:39.367
It's right next
to my favorite shoe store.

07:39.433 --> 07:41.402
Yeah, it's Ed's favorite hangout,

07:41.469 --> 07:42.636
and I think they're gonna
go out of business,

07:42.703 --> 07:45.539
so what I'm doing is looking
at a little marketing campaign

07:45.606 --> 07:47.274
to see if I can't save it.

07:47.341 --> 07:48.309
I haven't told Ed about it,
'cause I don't want

07:48.376 --> 07:49.477
to get his hopes up.

07:49.543 --> 07:53.280
You should totally create
a profile at hmmnothanks.com.

07:53.347 --> 07:54.448
Which is what?

07:54.515 --> 07:56.283
It's this web site
where my friends go

07:56.350 --> 07:58.652
to ironically diss on new hangouts.

07:58.719 --> 08:00.221
Okay. Um... here.

08:00.287 --> 08:04.191
Tell me, like,
three things about Murphy's.

08:04.258 --> 08:05.359
(Chuckles) It's dark.

08:05.426 --> 08:09.563
Okay. You mean, "Vintage atmosphere."

08:11.265 --> 08:12.433
It's dated.

08:12.500 --> 08:15.436
Um, "Authentic vibe."

08:15.503 --> 08:18.406
(Chuckles) It smells like old men.

08:18.472 --> 08:21.509
"Musty chic."

08:24.114 --> 08:26.049
Nice spin.
You got a knack for this.

08:26.116 --> 08:27.283
You know, this is what
I do for a living.

08:27.350 --> 08:30.153
You trick people into buying things?

08:30.220 --> 08:32.989
We call it "marketing."

08:36.393 --> 08:38.094
Oh, and then we had
this conference call

08:38.160 --> 08:39.895
with the barber dude,
and dad referred to me

08:39.962 --> 08:41.965
as his "associate,"
like I was a lawyer

08:42.030 --> 08:45.201
or even an attorney.
(Squeals)

08:45.268 --> 08:47.303
Mandy, a lawyer is an attorney.

08:47.370 --> 08:49.339
Excuse me. Were you there?

08:51.141 --> 08:53.109
Hey, guys, I didn't see
mom's car outside.

08:53.176 --> 08:55.111
Is she working late again?

08:55.178 --> 08:58.014
Mom? What is this "mom"
of whom you speak?

08:58.081 --> 09:01.317
You know, a-as a career woman,
I completely understand

09:01.384 --> 09:05.055
our mother's need to fulfill
herself professionally.

09:06.122 --> 09:09.252
You never cease to never amaze me.

09:10.960 --> 09:12.929
(Chuckles) Um, Eve...

09:12.996 --> 09:16.132
Are you wearing a dress?

09:16.199 --> 09:18.068
(Scoffs) So?

09:18.134 --> 09:19.302
So you never wear dresses.

09:19.369 --> 09:22.105
(Sighs) That is not true.

09:22.172 --> 09:24.908
You wore overalls
to your christening.

09:24.974 --> 09:26.142
(Sighs) It's no biggie.

09:26.209 --> 09:29.245
I'm just going to Victor Blake's
house to do homework.

09:29.312 --> 09:33.349
Oh, my God.
Would you bring mine?

09:33.416 --> 09:35.985
Aw. Is this, like, a date?
(Squeals)

09:36.052 --> 09:37.187
- It's not a date.
- (Gasps) Oh, my God.

09:37.253 --> 09:39.022
(Gasps) Do you want me
to do your makeup?

09:39.089 --> 09:40.256
- You mean like your makeup?
- Yeah.

09:40.323 --> 09:42.125
No.

09:42.192 --> 09:43.993
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, girls.

09:44.060 --> 09:44.994
- Hey, dad.
- Hi.

09:45.061 --> 09:47.063
Hey, Eve.
Are you wearing a dress?

09:47.130 --> 09:49.232
Not anymore!

09:49.299 --> 09:51.301
Come on. Come on.
Let me do your hair.

09:53.002 --> 09:54.070
Good job today.

09:54.137 --> 09:56.340
Right back at ya.

09:58.208 --> 09:59.309
I was thinking, how would you like

09:59.375 --> 10:01.878
to turn this work thing
into an internship?

10:01.945 --> 10:03.246
An internship?

10:03.313 --> 10:04.347
Yeah, no pressure.

10:04.414 --> 10:06.349
It just might help you get
into a career choice.

10:06.416 --> 10:09.285
Would I be around wealthy men?

10:10.353 --> 10:12.956
I don't know, Mandy.

10:14.991 --> 10:17.093
Hey, babe. Great day.

10:17.160 --> 10:20.363
There's a chance
Mandy may actually turn out

10:20.430 --> 10:22.198
to be self-sufficient.

10:22.265 --> 10:24.934
Who?

10:25.001 --> 10:27.137
Mandy-- middle daughter, big laugh?

10:27.203 --> 10:30.006
Oh, yeah. Her. Yeah.

10:30.073 --> 10:32.876
Didn't go so well?

10:32.942 --> 10:35.245
Um... (Clicks tongue)

10:35.311 --> 10:36.980
Well, I-I-- I'll, uh, I'll j--

10:37.047 --> 10:38.048
I'll just start with the good part.

10:38.114 --> 10:39.883
Um...

10:39.949 --> 10:41.317
I fell asleep at the meeting

10:41.384 --> 10:45.255
and, uh, toppled out of my chair.

10:45.321 --> 10:49.092
(Chuckles)

10:49.159 --> 10:53.229
Oh. Sorry. That's--
that sounds terrible.

10:53.296 --> 10:54.297
(Whispers) Yeah.

10:54.364 --> 10:55.965
Go on.

10:56.032 --> 10:58.902
Well, I... (Sighs)

10:58.968 --> 11:01.071
I-I was lying there
very self-conscious,

11:01.137 --> 11:02.972
and I--and I thought,

11:03.039 --> 11:05.942
they won't laugh at me
if they think I'm dying...

11:07.343 --> 11:12.882
So I, um, I-I sort of...

11:12.949 --> 11:15.318
Pretended I was having
a heart attack.

11:15.385 --> 11:17.220
Heart attack, like, uh, with the--

11:17.287 --> 11:20.056
yeah, you know, I-I twitched.
I-I clutched my arm.

11:20.123 --> 11:21.991
I-I, uh, I attempted that--

11:22.058 --> 11:24.994
the--the bubbly thing with my mouth.

11:25.061 --> 11:26.129
And they believed this?

11:26.196 --> 11:28.098
Well, I...

11:28.164 --> 11:29.966
No. Guys, no.
A-actually, I'm okay.

11:30.033 --> 11:33.336
I'm okay. Would--just...
Can you just unstrap me?

11:33.403 --> 11:36.072
So you go to the hospital
and nobody calls me?

11:36.139 --> 11:38.141
No, I pretended.
I-I pretended to call you.

11:38.208 --> 11:41.344
I did. I-I--the whole thing.
Everything. A big lie.

11:41.411 --> 11:44.314
(Voice breaks) Mike, my boss saw me

11:44.381 --> 11:48.318
in a paper gown from behind.

11:48.385 --> 11:49.986
(Sighs)

11:50.053 --> 11:52.088
You know why this happened?

11:52.155 --> 11:55.258
Because he walked right
in the room without knocking.

11:55.325 --> 11:57.894
I'm talking about
falling asleep at work.

11:57.961 --> 11:59.229
You're trying to do too much, babe.

11:59.295 --> 12:01.231
I-I don't want the girls
to feel neglected. I-I--

12:01.297 --> 12:03.299
I'm <i>here.</i> I'm telling you
I'll help out.

12:03.366 --> 12:04.934
You won't let me...
(Sighs)

12:05.001 --> 12:07.904
So now you're faking
heart attacks at work?

12:07.971 --> 12:08.972
I know. I know. I-I--

12:09.038 --> 12:10.240
it is so wrong to lie
about a health issue.

12:10.306 --> 12:12.976
I have never been
more ashamed in my life.

12:13.042 --> 12:14.177
Hey, mom.
(Sighs)

12:14.244 --> 12:15.979
- Why is your car still running outside?
- Ohh.

12:16.046 --> 12:19.049
Because I had a heart attack!

12:19.169 --> 12:22.318
<i>♪♪♪</i>

12:22.385 --> 12:23.987
Can you believe it?

12:24.054 --> 12:25.221
No, I can't.

12:25.288 --> 12:26.990
I've never seen more
than zero people in here. (Gasps)

12:27.057 --> 12:29.325
Dad, this is because
of my ideas! (Chuckles)

12:29.392 --> 12:30.894
I love marketing!

12:30.960 --> 12:31.995
(Chuckles) I bet.
(Laughing)

12:32.062 --> 12:33.363
- Look, we're talking business.
- I know!

12:33.430 --> 12:34.898
(Chuckles)
And I haven't thought about

12:34.964 --> 12:37.233
the Kardashians for hours.
(Chuckles)

12:37.300 --> 12:38.301
Yo, peeps.

12:38.368 --> 12:40.036
Kyle?

12:40.103 --> 12:42.205
I got a tweet about this place,
thought I'd check it out.

12:42.272 --> 12:44.074
What about work?

12:44.140 --> 12:45.108
It's my lunch hour.

12:45.175 --> 12:46.309
I never gave Murphy's much notice,

12:46.376 --> 12:48.311
but this place is really great.

12:48.378 --> 12:49.879
(Chuckles)

12:49.946 --> 12:51.047
Everyone is so unfriendly.

12:51.114 --> 12:55.018
Watch. Hey.
What's up, dude? Man?

12:55.085 --> 12:56.319
See?

12:56.386 --> 12:58.054
(Chuckles)

13:01.091 --> 13:02.125
(Knock on door)

13:02.192 --> 13:05.061
Hello. Mike Baxter's office.
Can I help you?

13:07.130 --> 13:09.966
No, honey. That's--
that's just when people call.

13:10.033 --> 13:12.235
(Chuckles) Oh.

13:12.302 --> 13:13.303
Uh, where's dad?

13:13.369 --> 13:15.071
Uh, he's working on my car.

13:15.138 --> 13:16.239
Can you leave him a message, please?

13:16.306 --> 13:17.273
- Yeah, sure.
- All right.

13:17.340 --> 13:19.075
Tell him I'm leaving-- leaving early

13:19.142 --> 13:21.244
because I'm too upset to work.

13:21.311 --> 13:22.312
- Oh.
- All right?

13:22.379 --> 13:24.881
Some jack-wang has started
an Internet campaign

13:24.948 --> 13:27.183
and ruined my barbershop.

13:29.219 --> 13:31.988
Uh, ruined?
I-I heard it was packed.

13:32.055 --> 13:33.256
Yes, by pretentious kids

13:33.323 --> 13:37.026
with little hats
and complicated coffee drinks.

13:37.093 --> 13:40.063
And... that's bad?

13:40.130 --> 13:41.898
It's terrible!

13:41.965 --> 13:43.900
I'd rather the place be turned
into a fat lady gym

13:43.967 --> 13:45.935
than that-- that hipster freak show.

13:46.002 --> 13:49.139
Now whichever idiot did that
should be hanged

13:49.205 --> 13:50.974
in a public square!

13:51.040 --> 13:52.375
"Signed, Ed."

13:54.411 --> 13:57.013
(Keys jangling)

13:57.080 --> 14:01.217
Well, I figured it out.
It's a loose fan belt, so...

14:01.284 --> 14:02.285
(Keys clatter)

14:02.352 --> 14:05.155
Can I get my new associate
a cup of coffee?

14:05.221 --> 14:07.891
(Voice breaks) I hate marketing!

14:07.957 --> 14:09.192
(Chuckles)

14:10.293 --> 14:12.228
Or tea?

14:20.357 --> 14:22.359
Wow. Something smells good.

14:22.426 --> 14:25.329
Yeah. Remember that deer
I bagged on the opening day

14:25.395 --> 14:27.264
of hunting season?

14:27.331 --> 14:31.034
You mean the one you hit
with your truck?

14:31.101 --> 14:34.271
Look, girlfriend, a kill is a kill.

14:35.572 --> 14:37.274
Ground it up.
A little barbecue sauce,

14:37.341 --> 14:41.211
special seasoning-- sloppy does.

14:41.278 --> 14:43.146
(Laughs)

14:45.082 --> 14:46.183
- Can I help?
- Uh, no, I'm good.

14:46.249 --> 14:48.385
Oh, okay. Well, let me just,
uh, put in a load of laundry.

14:48.452 --> 14:52.456
Oh, already cleaned,
dried, and rolled,

14:52.522 --> 14:54.124
but you know what you can do

14:54.191 --> 14:56.026
is get some croutons
or walnuts for the salad.

14:56.093 --> 14:57.461
I don't know where
you put 'em in the...

14:57.527 --> 14:59.196
Okay.

15:00.464 --> 15:02.065
(Exhales deeply) Hey, dad.

15:02.132 --> 15:03.400
Thank you for giving Boyd his bath.

15:03.467 --> 15:04.434
You bet. Here's his milk.

15:04.501 --> 15:05.435
- He probably won't need it.
- Thank you.

15:05.502 --> 15:08.438
He downed about a gallon
of bathwater.

15:08.505 --> 15:10.173
You know, I thought
with mom working more

15:10.240 --> 15:12.042
that this whole place
would fall apart,

15:12.109 --> 15:14.177
but it's almost like
nobody's even noticed.

15:17.447 --> 15:19.316
I don't think she meant it that way.

15:19.383 --> 15:22.286
What did she mean?

15:22.352 --> 15:24.087
Uh, things aren't going
that smoothly.

15:24.154 --> 15:25.455
They look like this,
but I didn't even get

15:25.522 --> 15:28.191
enough root vegetables for the salad.

15:29.192 --> 15:30.360
How humiliating. (Chuckles)

15:30.427 --> 15:32.296
Honey, come on.

15:32.362 --> 15:33.497
Babe, I've done this for two days.

15:33.563 --> 15:35.232
You do this all the time.

15:35.299 --> 15:38.201
I just... (Sighs)

15:38.268 --> 15:39.369
I feel replaceable.

15:39.436 --> 15:41.038
(Sighs) Baby.

15:41.104 --> 15:42.439
(Sniffles)

15:42.506 --> 15:44.274
Hey, Eve.
Dinner's almost ready.

15:44.341 --> 15:46.243
(Sniffles) Eve?

15:46.310 --> 15:47.244
(Sniffles)

15:47.311 --> 15:49.279
Honey, I need my nuts.

15:51.481 --> 15:54.184
(Eve sniffles)

15:57.154 --> 15:59.022
What's up, bug?

15:59.089 --> 16:01.191
(Sniffles) It's no big deal.

16:01.258 --> 16:03.360
Well, if it's no big deal,
why don't you tell me?

16:05.195 --> 16:07.197
I was at Victor Blake's house,

16:07.264 --> 16:09.132
and we were doing our homework

16:09.199 --> 16:11.201
and some of Mandy's...

16:13.570 --> 16:15.205
(Sighs, voice breaking)
And then he brought up

16:15.272 --> 16:17.107
the winter school dance.

16:17.174 --> 16:19.242
Hey, that's exciting...

16:20.477 --> 16:22.245
Or terrible.

16:22.312 --> 16:24.448
(Sighs) He wanted to know my opinion

16:24.514 --> 16:26.450
on what girl he should ask.

16:31.088 --> 16:32.322
Oh, sweetie.

16:32.389 --> 16:33.323
(Sighs)

16:33.390 --> 16:35.192
(Inhales deeply)

16:35.258 --> 16:37.494
(Sighs)

16:37.561 --> 16:40.497
The thing about Victor Blake is...

16:40.564 --> 16:41.498
(Sighs)

16:41.565 --> 16:44.134
He's...

16:44.201 --> 16:47.437
Boys--boys are just...

16:47.504 --> 16:50.173
(Sighs) Oh, he's a dumb-ass.

16:53.110 --> 16:55.445
(Sighs) I can't believe I put
on a stupid dress for that guy.

16:55.512 --> 16:57.014
Oh, I know.

16:57.080 --> 16:59.082
(Sniffles) I know.

17:00.107 --> 17:03.020
Please don't tell dad.

17:03.086 --> 17:06.156
He's gonna be all...
Dad about it.

17:06.223 --> 17:09.026
I promise.

17:09.092 --> 17:11.461
But I'm glad you're being
all mom about it.

17:11.528 --> 17:13.463
Mm.

17:13.530 --> 17:18.201
(Sniffles) Do you think
I'll ever like another boy?

17:18.268 --> 17:24.040
There are gonna be lots
and lots of boys, I promise,

17:24.107 --> 17:27.344
and they're all gonna be
equally disappointing.

17:28.512 --> 17:29.446
(Chuckles)

17:29.513 --> 17:31.281
(Chuckles)

17:32.516 --> 17:35.285
(Both chuckle)

17:35.352 --> 17:37.454
(Chuckles) Look at that, Mandy.

17:37.521 --> 17:40.424
Rolled--far better than folded.

17:40.490 --> 17:42.292
Oh, my God.

17:42.359 --> 17:45.095
Ryan Gosling seen
at a popular Hollywood eatery

17:45.162 --> 17:46.363
with his shirt off.

17:46.430 --> 17:48.265
Could you stay off
the Internet for a minute?

17:48.332 --> 17:49.266
Oh, my God. Pippa,
you are so much better

17:49.333 --> 17:51.034
than that hat, girl.

17:51.101 --> 17:52.202
Can't you live
in this world for a second?

17:52.269 --> 17:54.071
- Yeah.
- Listen to me.

17:54.137 --> 17:55.505
You're smart and you're creative,

17:55.572 --> 17:57.107
but that doesn't mean
people are gonna like

17:57.174 --> 17:58.442
every idea you come up with.

17:58.508 --> 18:00.110
That's why it isn't worth it.

18:00.177 --> 18:04.381
Listen, if you run from
every criticism... (Sighs)

18:04.448 --> 18:07.484
(Strained voice) You're gonna
be living here a long time.

18:07.551 --> 18:09.419
(Doorbell rings)

18:14.091 --> 18:15.158
Hey, Ed.

18:15.225 --> 18:18.128
Hey, Mike. Yeah, I was, uh,
driving around town

18:18.195 --> 18:22.132
looking for a new man cave,
and I actually found--

18:22.199 --> 18:26.169
I actually found a bar
called "The Man Cave."

18:26.236 --> 18:28.305
Uh, Ed, that's a--

18:28.372 --> 18:30.540
yeah, I know that <i>now,</i> Mike.

18:32.476 --> 18:35.445
I got your message.
Is your daughter home?

18:35.512 --> 18:38.415
Amanda, you have a gentleman caller.

18:38.482 --> 18:41.418
Oh. Hello, Mr. Alzate.
(Door closes)

18:41.485 --> 18:46.123
Mandy, ahem, I understand,
uh, you were the brains

18:46.189 --> 18:49.493
behind the transformation
of my barbershop.

18:49.559 --> 18:51.361
Yeah. I'm so sorry.

18:51.428 --> 18:54.364
No. I'm sorry.

18:54.431 --> 18:56.199
You see, there's two things I hate,

18:56.266 --> 18:59.436
and that's change
and hipsters, you know?

18:59.503 --> 19:02.439
Put 'em both together, and it's
like a hot coal in my trunks.

19:02.506 --> 19:04.274
- Ed.
- I'm sorry.

19:04.341 --> 19:06.109
Boxer briefs.

19:06.176 --> 19:09.279
(Clears throat)
What I'm trying to say is,

19:09.346 --> 19:11.248
I know you were trying to help,

19:11.315 --> 19:13.250
you see, so as a token of contrition,

19:13.317 --> 19:17.187
please accept this...
This premium dessert wine.

19:17.254 --> 19:19.289
It's from--

19:19.356 --> 19:22.025
it's from my family's vineyard
in the basque country,

19:22.092 --> 19:26.229
where my ancestors have worked
the grape for centuries.

19:26.296 --> 19:28.131
(Chuckles) Ed, she's 17.

19:28.198 --> 19:31.068
That's all right.
It's basically undrinkable.

19:31.134 --> 19:32.402
- So just...
- Oh, thank you.

19:32.469 --> 19:34.271
I-I forgive you, Mr. Alzate.

19:34.338 --> 19:35.372
(Whispers) Thank you.

19:35.439 --> 19:37.441
Um, and I will keep
this wine until I turn 21...

19:37.507 --> 19:38.442
Mm.

19:38.508 --> 19:40.110
At which time I will savor

19:40.177 --> 19:45.015
my very first taste
of any alcoholic beverage.

19:45.082 --> 19:46.183
That's as far as we go with that.

19:46.249 --> 19:48.251
Okay.

19:48.318 --> 19:49.453
How about coming by work tomorrow

19:49.519 --> 19:50.487
and let's try this again?

19:50.554 --> 19:54.480
You know, I'm a little burned-out.

19:57.094 --> 19:58.495
You were there three hours.

19:58.562 --> 20:03.200
I know. It was exhausting,
but I don't know.

20:03.267 --> 20:05.202
It was kinda cool to think of ideas

20:05.269 --> 20:07.271
and then make them happen.

20:07.337 --> 20:11.208
I-I could maybe see myself
doing that someday.

20:11.275 --> 20:13.110
- Really?
- Yeah, I mean, I'd need

20:13.176 --> 20:15.045
a much bigger office...
(Chuckles) Of course.

20:15.112 --> 20:17.481
Thanks for believing in me, hmm?

20:17.547 --> 20:21.118
Ah, look at this.

20:21.184 --> 20:25.489
Father and daughter reconnecting
while another man looks on.

20:25.555 --> 20:27.429
All righty.

20:35.504 --> 20:38.574
Boy, oh, boy. I am exhausted.

20:38.641 --> 20:39.575
(Sighs) Mm.

20:39.642 --> 20:41.510
(Chuckles) Welcome to my world.

20:41.577 --> 20:42.678
Mm.
(Inhales deeply)

20:42.745 --> 20:44.380
(Sighs) Would you give
me a massage later?

20:44.447 --> 20:46.716
And it doesn't even have
to lead to anything, you know?

20:46.782 --> 20:49.618
You really <i>are</i> tired.

20:49.685 --> 20:51.320
Ohh.

20:51.387 --> 20:53.689
I'm so glad you were here
to handle this thing with Eve.

20:53.756 --> 20:55.524
I don't think I could have done that.

20:55.591 --> 20:57.493
Well, what would you have done?

20:57.560 --> 20:58.527
I would have pushed that kid's bike

20:58.594 --> 21:00.563
down a storm drain.

21:02.498 --> 21:05.534
Well, that's one way.
(Chuckles)

21:05.601 --> 21:09.305
Here's to my irreplaceable wife.

21:09.372 --> 21:11.407
Let's take a shot at Ed's wine.
How bad could it be, huh?

21:11.474 --> 21:12.408
Mm. (Chuckles) (Clink)

21:12.475 --> 21:14.276
(Chuckles) Mm.

21:14.343 --> 21:17.279
(Slurps and smacks lips)

21:17.346 --> 21:19.382
(Strained voice) Goes in nice.

21:19.448 --> 21:22.451
Ohh. Ah.

21:22.518 --> 21:25.688
It kinda--kinda has a-a... burn.

21:25.755 --> 21:27.523
It's, uh... oh, God.

21:27.590 --> 21:29.425
It's, uh... (Smacks lips)

21:29.492 --> 21:31.794
I kinda like it.
