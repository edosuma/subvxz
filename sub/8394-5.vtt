WEBVTT

00:00.890 --> 00:02.061
- TOOK SOME PHOTOS?
- MM-HMM.

00:02.100 --> 00:04.648
- THESE ARE PRETTY GOOD, MAX.
YOU OUGHT TO DO PEOPLE.

00:04.690 --> 00:06.783
- I SAY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT
POSSIBLY SELLING THE HOUSE

00:06.830 --> 00:10.038
AND YOU PULL A YEAR-LONG PROJECT
INTO THE DRIVEWAY?

00:10.070 --> 00:12.106
- PEET MIGHT NOT BE
EXACTLY WHO YOU'RE PICTURING.

00:12.150 --> 00:14.789
- HI. YOU MUST BE JULIA.
- HEY.

00:14.840 --> 00:17.217
- OPEN YOUR EYES. I DON'T WANT
YOU TO MAKE THE MISTAKES I MADE.

00:17.250 --> 00:19.810
- YOUR MOM CALLED, LIKE,
TWO OR THREE TIMES.

00:19.840 --> 00:20.943
- SHE'S ANNOYING.

00:20.980 --> 00:21.901
- YOU DON'T KNOW ROCK AND ROLL!
- WHOA, WHOA, HEY.

00:21.950 --> 00:23.804
- I GOTTA TELL THE BAND
I'M DROPPING 'EM.

00:23.850 --> 00:25.806
- GONNA GET THOSE SONGS BACK.

00:25.850 --> 00:28.318
- YOU WANT ASHES OF ROME
TO COME BACK HERE.

00:28.370 --> 00:29.268
- THANK YOU.

00:30.580 --> 00:33.333
- OKAY, DO YOU WANT HEAW
OR LIGHT PEANUT BUTTER?

00:33.370 --> 00:34.678
- YOU ALREADY
MADE MY SANDWICH.

00:34.720 --> 00:36.119
- I DIDN'T MAKE--
- YEAH, YOU DID.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.582
- I DIDN'T MAKE YOUR SANDWICH.
- RIGHT THERE.

00:38.620 --> 00:39.587
- OH, MY GOD,
I DID MAKE YOUR SANDWICH.

00:39.620 --> 00:40.826
WHAT AN IDIOT. OKAY. UM...

00:40.860 --> 00:44.318
- YESTERDAY YOU GAVE ME
TWO THERMOSES. I ONLY NEED ONE.

00:44.350 --> 00:45.442
- WELL, THAT WAS INTENTIONAL,
THOUGH,

00:45.490 --> 00:47.583
BECAUSE I'M REALLY CONCERNED
ABOUT YOUR HYDRATION.

00:47.630 --> 00:49.074
IT'S MY TOP PRIORITY.

00:49.110 --> 00:50.862
- HEY, I CAN'T FIND
HIS BACKPACK ANYWHERE.

00:50.910 --> 00:52.184
ARE YOU SURE YOU BROUGHT IT
HOME FROM SCHOOL YESTERDAY?

00:52.220 --> 00:54.256
- HONEY, I DIDN'T PICK HIM UP
YESTERDAY, YOU PICKED HIM UP.

00:54.290 --> 00:55.109
[knock on door]
- NO, I DIDN'T.

00:55.150 --> 00:55.969
- YES, YOU PICKED HIM UP
FROM SCHOOL.

00:56.020 --> 00:57.112
- HEY, EVERYBODY.
- HEY, UNCLE ADAM.

00:57.160 --> 00:59.799
- SORRY FOR THE INTRUSION.
- NO PROBLEM, NO PROBLEM.

00:59.850 --> 01:01.397
- JUST HAVE SOME MORE
HAND-ME-DOWNS FROM NORA THERE.

01:01.440 --> 01:03.465
- OH, THANK YOU.
- HI, UNCLE ADAM.

01:03.510 --> 01:04.465
- JABBAR,
WHAT'S GOING ON, BUDDY?

01:04.510 --> 01:05.670
- NOTHING.
- COMING IN HOT.

01:05.720 --> 01:06.539
- WHAT A BEAUTIFUL DAY.
- COME ON, LET'S GET YOUR SHOES.

01:06.580 --> 01:08.093
- YEAH, THAT'S A NUMBER TWO,
I THINK.

01:08.130 --> 01:10.507
- OH, YEAH?
- YEAH, WE GOT A--

01:10.550 --> 01:12.404
- GOT A LITTLE FRESH LOAD THERE?
- WE SURE DO.

01:12.450 --> 01:14.509
- LISTEN TO ME.
I HAVE GOT SOME GREAT NEWS.

01:14.550 --> 01:15.756
WE GOT THE RIGHTS.

01:15.790 --> 01:17.519
- CONGRATULATIONS.
- TO THE SONGS.

01:17.560 --> 01:18.788
- WHAT SONGS?

01:18.830 --> 01:20.138
- TO THE ASHES OF ROME SONGS.

01:20.180 --> 01:21.727
THE THREE SONGS
WE ALREADY RECORDED.

01:21.770 --> 01:23.829
THE LABEL SAID
WE COULD HAVE 'EM.

01:23.870 --> 01:24.905
- YOU GOT THEM
TO GIVE YOU THOSE SONGS.

01:24.940 --> 01:27.761
- YES, I DID.

01:27.810 --> 01:29.766
- WHAT DEAL DID YOU MAKE?
THEY DON'T JUST GIVE SONG--WHOO!

01:29.810 --> 01:31.732
- I MADE A SWEETHEART DEAL.
THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW.

01:31.780 --> 01:32.667
- YOU MADE A SWEETHEART DEAL.
- YES, I DID.

01:32.710 --> 01:34.223
- WHAT IS THE SWEETHEART DEAL?

01:34.260 --> 01:37.809
- I SIMPLY TRADED THE STUDIO
TIME FOR THE SONGS.

01:37.850 --> 01:40.603
- THAT WAS 72 BILLABLE HOURS!
- ALL RIGHT, I KNOW, I KNOW.

01:40.650 --> 01:41.810
BUT THESE ARE THE FIRST...
- THEY WERE MY HOURS.

01:41.860 --> 01:43.339
- THREE SONGS ON THE FIRST
ALBUM--WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

01:43.370 --> 01:44.928
- YEAH.

01:44.960 --> 01:47.781
- I SAID, "I'M GONNA GO GET
THE SONGS," YOU SAID, "OKAY."

01:47.830 --> 01:49.479
- BUT I DIDN'T REALLY
THINK YOU WOULD

01:49.520 --> 01:51.545
POSSIBLY BE ABLE
TO PULL IT OFF.

01:51.590 --> 01:53.137
- WELL, THAT WAS YOUR MISTAKE.

01:54.520 --> 01:55.509
- KIND OF.
- LISTEN, YOU SAID--

01:55.560 --> 01:58.313
- BY GIVING AWAY MY LABOR...
- LISTEN TO ME.

01:58.350 --> 01:59.351
- YOU PULLED IT OFF.
- YOU SAID THEY'RE GOOD.

01:59.390 --> 02:01.358
YOU SAID THAT THEY'RE GOOD SONGS
AND HE CAN SING.

02:01.390 --> 02:03.255
- HE'S A GREAT SINGER.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.109
BUT HE IS INSUFFERABLE,
AND I'M NOT GONNA WORK WITH HIM.

02:04.150 --> 02:06.289
- THIS IS A GOOD THING,
ALL RIGHT?

02:06.330 --> 02:08.912
SO YOU GOTTA MAN UP.
I WANT YOU TO BE EXCITED.

02:08.950 --> 02:11.362
THE LUNCHEONETTE LABEL IS ALIVE
AND WELL. WE'RE MAKING AN ALBUM.

02:11.400 --> 02:14.608
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
I WILL MAN UP IF YOU MAN UP.

02:14.650 --> 02:16.857
ALL RIGHT, DEAL MAKER?
DEAL WITH THAT FOR ME.

02:16.890 --> 02:20.929
MAKE A DEAL. MAKE A DEAL
WITH THE HAMPER ON THAT, OKAY?

02:20.960 --> 02:21.927
- I'LL SEE YOU AT WORK.
ALL RIGHT?

02:21.960 --> 02:23.166
[bell rings]

02:23.210 --> 02:26.896
- I KNOW YOU GOT MY NUMBER

02:26.930 --> 02:29.512
- MAX BRAVERMAN,
CEDAR KNOLL YEARBOOK.

02:29.560 --> 02:30.959
- WAIT, MAX, I DON'T
HAVE MY LIP GLOSS ON.

02:31.010 --> 02:31.829
- WE WEREN'T SMILING.
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

02:31.870 --> 02:33.792
PHOTOGRAPHY'S
ABOUT REAL MOMENTS.

02:33.840 --> 02:34.761
- FAKE SMILES
ARE NOT REAL MOMENTS.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.620
- I GOT SOMETHING ON YOU

02:36.670 --> 02:38.558
- MAX BRAVERMAN,
CEDAR KNOLL YEARBOOK.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.636
[shutter clicks]

02:40.670 --> 02:45.505
- YOU KNOW ME
AND MY WEAKNESS

02:45.540 --> 02:49.408
AND YOU KNOW
MY BIGGEST SECRET

02:49.440 --> 02:52.307
STILL I THINK THAT
I GOT SOMETHING ON YOU

02:52.340 --> 02:54.991
- IS HE TAKING OUR PICTURE?
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:55.030 --> 02:55.928
- WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
- MAX BRAVERMAN,

02:55.960 --> 02:57.370
CEDAR KNOLL YEARBOOK.

02:57.410 --> 02:59.378
- STOP IT, GET AWAY FROM ME!
- SHE'S CRYING.

02:59.420 --> 03:00.899
- SO?
- DON'T BE A JERK.

03:00.930 --> 03:02.340
- I'M CAPTURING MOMENTS
FOR THE YEARBOOK--REAL MOMENTS.

03:02.380 --> 03:04.348
- GO AWAY!
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

03:04.390 --> 03:07.245
- GET AWAY FROM ME!
STOP IT!

03:07.290 --> 03:08.973
- JUST LEAVE US ALONE,
FREAK.

03:09.010 --> 03:10.523
- JUST GO AWAY.

03:10.560 --> 03:12.767
- SWEET-EET-EET PERSUASION

03:12.810 --> 03:14.903
I'VE GOT A HARD

03:14.950 --> 03:19.466
REPUTATION

03:19.500 --> 03:21.912
[shutter clicking]

03:21.960 --> 03:23.951
- HEY.

03:23.990 --> 03:25.719
HEY, HEY, HEY, M-MILLIE, LOOK.

03:25.750 --> 03:28.264
THERE SHE IS AGAIN.
SHE'S TAKING PICTURES.

03:28.310 --> 03:29.959
- HEY! HEY!
- ZEEK. ZEEK.

03:30.000 --> 03:30.989
- HEY. [Whistles] HELLO!
- SHE'S NOT BOTHERING ANYONE.

03:31.030 --> 03:32.270
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- HI. HI. I AM SO SORRY.

03:32.310 --> 03:33.379
- SHE'S NOT BOTHERING ANYONE.
- WELL, SHE'S BOTHERING ME.

03:33.420 --> 03:36.753
- I SHOULD'VE INTRODUCED MYSELF.
I'M KAREN FILLMAN.

03:36.800 --> 03:37.892
CORNING REALTY.
- CAMILLE BRAVERMAN.

03:37.940 --> 03:39.862
MY HUSBAND ZEEK.
- NICE TO MEET YOU, ZEEK.

03:39.900 --> 03:41.379
YOU GUYS, THIS PLACE
IS SO GORGEOUS.

03:41.420 --> 03:44.241
I WAS JUST
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

03:44.290 --> 03:46.520
DROPPING OFF PAPERS
AT THE TAYLORS' PLACE.

03:46.570 --> 03:49.425
- OH, I HEARD THEY SOLD.
- THEY DID. 30% OVER ASKING.

03:49.470 --> 03:51.847
FIVE SOLID OFFERS. I'VE NEVER
SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.

03:51.880 --> 03:53.086
THIS PLACE IS A GOLDMINE.

03:53.120 --> 03:55.327
- DID THE TAYLORS HAVE TO DO
A LOT OF WORK TO THEIR HOUSE

03:55.370 --> 03:57.952
BEFORE THEY PUT IT UP
ON THE MARKET?

03:57.990 --> 04:00.367
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T
DONE ANYTHING IN SO LONG,

04:00.410 --> 04:02.332
AND TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
WE NEED A NEW ROOF.

04:02.380 --> 04:03.472
- SURE, THE TAYLORS' HOUSE
WAS MODERNIZED,

04:03.510 --> 04:06.274
BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE THE CHARM
THAT THIS PLACE HAS.

04:06.310 --> 04:07.402
THIS ONE WOULD SELL
AT TOP OF THE MARKET.

04:07.450 --> 04:10.613
A HANDYMAN SPECIAL LIKE THIS
WOULD GO IN A SECOND.

04:10.660 --> 04:11.513
IF YOU WANT
I COULD TAKE A LOOK,

04:11.560 --> 04:13.482
I COULD MAYBE GIVE YOU
A PRICE RANGE,

04:13.520 --> 04:15.340
GET YOU A BETTER IDEA
OF WHAT IT'S WORTH.

04:15.390 --> 04:17.483
- THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
- NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

04:17.530 --> 04:20.044
WHAT'D YOU CALL THIS,
A HANDYMAN SPECIAL?

04:20.080 --> 04:21.638
- I-I DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING
BY IT, MR. BRAVERMAN.

04:21.670 --> 04:23.399
- YEAH, WELL, IT'S GONNA STAY
A HANDYMAN SPECIAL

04:23.430 --> 04:25.739
IF I HAVE ANYTHING
TO SAY ABOUT IT.

04:25.780 --> 04:27.088
NICE MEETING YOU.
SEE YOU LATER.

04:27.120 --> 04:29.327
- SO YOU PLUNGED IT, EH?
- I PLUNGED IT LIKE CRAZY.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.951
- OKAY.
- I'M NOT A PLUNGER.

04:30.990 --> 04:35.051
- [chuckles]
IS THE CLOG VERY VISIBLE?

04:35.100 --> 04:37.546
- NO, NOTHING, TOTALLY--
WATCH YOUR STEP. TOTALLY CLEAN.

04:37.580 --> 04:40.708
- OH. OH. OH, OKAY.
- YEAH. YOU KNOW?

04:40.760 --> 04:42.409
- WE HAD THIS PROBLEM IN 4E
LAST WEEK, AND THIS--

04:42.450 --> 04:44.486
OOPSIE.
- WOW.

04:44.520 --> 04:45.999
- THIS BABY FIXED IT RIGHT UP.
SO I THINK--

04:46.040 --> 04:46.859
- DO YOU NEED HELP?

04:46.900 --> 04:48.037
- YOU'VE COME
TO THE RIGHT PLACE.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.035
- WHAT IS THAT BABY?

04:49.080 --> 04:52.311
- THIS IS A PLUMBING SNAKE.

04:52.360 --> 04:53.930
- IS THAT FOR TOILETS?
- YEAH.

04:53.980 --> 04:55.311
- OKAY.
- AND WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO...

04:55.360 --> 04:56.736
- LOOK AT YOU.

04:56.770 --> 04:57.976
- IS REALLY, LIKE,
WORK THAT CLOG.

04:58.020 --> 04:58.907
- I'D LIKE TO OFFER HELP,
BUT I'M USELESS.

04:58.950 --> 04:59.939
- NO, IT'S OKAY.
[grunts]

04:59.980 --> 05:02.369
GIVE IT A REAL GOOD--
[growls]

05:02.400 --> 05:05.016
- IS THAT TOO HARD?
- REALLY GET IN THERE.

05:05.060 --> 05:06.982
THINK I FELT SOMETHING
MOVE, SO...

05:07.030 --> 05:08.099
- NEED HELP?
- NO.

05:08.130 --> 05:10.883
- 'CAUSE I CAN'T OFFER IT.
- YOU SHOULD BE ALL SET.

05:10.930 --> 05:12.124
[toilet flushes]
HA!

05:12.170 --> 05:14.616
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

05:20.730 --> 05:23.961
- JOB WELL DONE.

05:24.010 --> 05:26.592
MAY GOD BLESS
AND KEEP YOU ALWAYS

05:26.630 --> 05:28.450
AND MAY YOUR WISHES
ALL COME TRUE

05:28.500 --> 05:31.560
MAY YOU ALWAYS DO
FOR OTHERS

05:31.600 --> 05:34.012
AND LET OTHERS DO FOR YOU

05:34.050 --> 05:36.564
MAY YOU BUILD A LADDER
TO THE STARS

05:36.610 --> 05:38.771
AND CLIMB ON EVERY RUNG

05:38.820 --> 05:41.084
AND MAY YOU STAY

05:41.130 --> 05:43.644
FOREVER YOUNG

05:43.680 --> 05:45.500
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE RIGHTEOUS

05:45.550 --> 05:48.542
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE TRUE

05:48.580 --> 05:51.140
MAY YOU ALWAYS KNOW
THE TRUTH

05:51.170 --> 05:52.489
AND SEE THE LIGHTS
SURROUNDING YOU

05:52.520 --> 05:56.104
MAY YOU ALWAYS BE
COURAGEOUS

05:56.140 --> 05:57.380
STAND UPRIGHT
AND BE STRONG

05:57.420 --> 05:59.172
AND MAY YOU STAY

05:59.220 --> 06:02.929
FOREVER YOUNG

06:02.980 --> 06:04.379
MAY YOU STAY

06:04.430 --> 06:07.900
FOREVER YOUNG

06:11.750 --> 06:13.889
- I ORDERED THE SAUSALITOS,
BUT I CAN CANCEL THEM.

06:13.920 --> 06:15.774
SO LET ME JUST MAKE SURE
I HAVE THIS.

06:15.820 --> 06:17.856
YOU WANT ME
TO MOVE THE WINDOWS

06:17.890 --> 06:19.744
SO THEY'RE FACING
SOUTH AND WEST.

06:19.790 --> 06:22.884
OKAY. YUP.

06:22.930 --> 06:23.954
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.855
[sighs]
- PEET WANTS MORE CHANGES?

06:26.900 --> 06:29.892
- YEAH, IT'S PART
OF HER CREATIVE PROCESS.

06:29.940 --> 06:32.727
- [Chuckles] THAT'S VERY NICE
OF YOU TO CALL IT THAT.

06:32.770 --> 06:34.795
- I MEAN, I CAN DO THE WORK,

06:34.840 --> 06:37.172
IT'S JUST HOW MANY TIMES
IS SHE GONNA CHANGE HER MIND?

06:37.220 --> 06:39.211
- WELL, UNTIL YOU PUT
YOUR FOOT DOWN, BABE.

06:39.260 --> 06:41.080
- OKAY, HONEY,
SHE'S AN ARCHITECT.

06:41.120 --> 06:42.803
IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN TELL HER
TO STOP HAVING IDEAS.

06:42.850 --> 06:45.489
- OKAY, BUT YOU CAN
BILL FOR THE EXTRA HOURS.

06:45.540 --> 06:47.633
- THE BID IS THE BID.

06:47.680 --> 06:49.773
- AM I NOT ALLOWED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS?

06:49.820 --> 06:50.912
- NO, SORRY, I'M JUST--
I'M PISSED.

06:50.960 --> 06:54.123
- OKAY, WELL, I'M NOT GONNA
GET IN THE MIDDLE OF IT,

06:54.170 --> 06:56.684
BUT YOU AGREED TO A JOB
AND THAT JOB IS CHANGING, SO...

06:56.720 --> 06:58.449
PEOPLE LIKE HER
WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU.

06:58.480 --> 06:59.299
I KNOW, I'VE BEEN THERE.

06:59.340 --> 07:01.513
- OKAY, WELL,
THE SECOND I REALIZE

07:01.550 --> 07:02.994
SHE'S TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ME,
I WILL TELL HER.

07:03.040 --> 07:05.964
- GOOD.
- GOOD.

07:06.010 --> 07:07.147
- IT'S REALLY GOOD
TO HAVE BOUNDARIES, YOU KNOW?

07:07.180 --> 07:09.592
FROM THE OUTSET.
- MM-HMM.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.689
- I MEAN, WE DIDN'T SEND A FAX
AT THE FIRM WITHOUT CHARGING.

07:11.740 --> 07:13.594
- YEAH,
THIS IS NOT THE FIRM.

07:13.640 --> 07:15.119
THIS IS A TOTALLY
DIFFERENT THING.

07:15.150 --> 07:18.699
- ALL I'M SAYING IS YOU DON'T
WANT TO END UP IN A SITUATION

07:18.740 --> 07:19.729
WHERE YOU'RE COMPLETELY BEHIND

07:19.780 --> 07:21.987
OR YOU'VE COMPLETELY
EATEN INTO YOUR PROFITS

07:22.020 --> 07:23.089
AND YOU HAVE A FAMILY
TO THINK OF.

07:23.130 --> 07:24.813
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'LL TALK TO HER.

07:24.850 --> 07:26.909
- OKAY.

07:26.960 --> 07:28.473
YOU CAN FRAME IT
AS A CONVERSATION

07:28.510 --> 07:30.091
ABOUT YOUR CREATIVE
PROCESS TOGETHER,

07:30.130 --> 07:32.098
AND SHE'LL NEVER EVEN KNOW
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BOUNDARIES.

07:32.140 --> 07:33.061
[cell phone rings]
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

07:33.100 --> 07:35.921
- PEET AGAIN?
- YOUR SISTER.

07:35.970 --> 07:39.690
HEY, SARAH.

07:39.730 --> 07:41.243
YEAH, OKAY.

07:41.280 --> 07:44.078
UM, NO, YOU CAN'T SNAKE IT
THROUGH THE TOILET BOWL.

07:44.110 --> 07:45.839
YOU HAVE TO USE
THE OUTSIDE LINE.

07:45.870 --> 07:46.939
OH, YOU DID.

07:46.980 --> 07:51.633
OKAY.
UH, I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

07:51.670 --> 07:53.843
YOU GOT IT.
- [clears throat]

07:53.880 --> 07:55.290
- HOW DO I SET BOUNDARIES
WITH YOUR SISTER?

07:55.330 --> 07:57.059
- HER YOU JUST HELP.

07:57.090 --> 08:00.059
- WE KNOW THAT THIS HAS BEEN
A ROUGH WEEK FOR YOU GUYS.

08:00.100 --> 08:03.092
- YEAH. I QUIT MY CUSH GRAPHICS
JOB TO RECORD THIS ALBUM.

08:03.130 --> 08:05.018
- LOOK, SCREW THE LABEL, MAN.

08:05.070 --> 08:07.584
THEY TALK A SWEET GAME

08:07.620 --> 08:09.303
STRUTTING OUT
THEIR PIMP A&R GUY

08:09.350 --> 08:11.272
WITH SOME ROCK CREDENTIAL CREDIT
FROM 1940, ALL LIKE,

08:11.310 --> 08:14.199
"I DISCOVERED THE BASS PLAYER
FOR MINOR THREAT,

08:14.250 --> 08:16.036
SO I KNOW WHAT
ROCK AND ROLL IS."

08:16.080 --> 08:17.069
- I THINK MINOR THREAT'S 1980,
BUT YEAH, THAT'S A VALID POINT.

08:17.110 --> 08:19.146
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S NOT QUIBBLE OVER DETAILS.

08:19.180 --> 08:21.045
- WHATEVER, MAN,

08:21.080 --> 08:23.765
IT'S ALL PART OF THE SAME
KATY PERRY SAUSAGE FACTORY.

08:23.810 --> 08:26.256
I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE A
CREATIVE HOSTAGE ANYMORE, OKAY?

08:26.290 --> 08:27.803
- I GET THAT,
AND WE DON'T WANT YOU

08:27.850 --> 08:29.249
TO BE A CREATIVE
HOSTAGE EITHER,

08:29.300 --> 08:31.985
AND THAT'S WHY WE WANT
TO PRODUCE YOUR RECORD.

08:32.020 --> 08:35.194
OKAY, AND WE WANT YOUR
CREATIVITY TO JUST FLOW FREELY.

08:35.230 --> 08:37.926
JUST FREE FLOW. RIGHT?

08:37.960 --> 08:40.190
- GATES WIDE OPEN.
FULL DELUGE OF CREATIVITY.

08:40.240 --> 08:41.889
- WOULD YOU PLEASE?

08:41.930 --> 08:43.579
- VIVA CREATIVITY.

08:43.620 --> 08:45.167
- THAT'S AWESOME
YOU FLIPPED A BUNCH OF SWITCHES

08:45.210 --> 08:46.131
BACK IN THE DAY.

08:46.180 --> 08:48.034
- MM.

08:48.070 --> 08:48.889
- BUT THIS IS A RECORD,
AND YOU GOTTA PRODUCE IT.

08:48.940 --> 08:51.727
YOU'RE PRODUCING MY RECORD.
- RIGHT.

08:51.770 --> 08:54.216
- WHAT ABOUT THE SONGS
WE ALREADY RECORDED?

08:54.250 --> 08:55.763
- OH, YOU'RE GONNA LIKE THIS.

08:55.810 --> 08:58.768
TELL 'EM ABOUT THE SWEETHEART
DEAL YOU BROKERED.

08:58.810 --> 09:00.801
- I MADE A DEAL
WITH YOUR FORMER LABEL.

09:00.850 --> 09:02.158
IN EXCHANGE FOR THE AMOUNT

09:02.190 --> 09:03.669
THAT THEY OWED
FOR THE RECORDING TIME...

09:03.710 --> 09:04.779
- I.E. MY LABOR.

09:04.820 --> 09:08.369
- WE HAVE THE SONGS.
WE OWN THE SONGS.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.095
AND THAT WAS
A BIG PAYDAY FOR US,

09:10.130 --> 09:12.928
AND I THINK THAT SPEAKS TO
HOW MUCH WE BELIEVE IN YOU GUYS.

09:12.960 --> 09:13.995
- I DON'T KNOW.
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME, MAN.

09:14.030 --> 09:16.544
- DOES IT?
- YEAH.

09:20.930 --> 09:25.173
- WHY SHOULD WE
TAKE A CHANCE ON YOU GUYS?

09:25.210 --> 09:27.861
- WE'RE TAKING
A CHANCE ON YOU.

09:31.050 --> 09:33.325
- ALL RIGHT, WHATEVER.
I JUST WANNA MAKE MUSIC.

09:33.360 --> 09:34.770
- GREAT. LET'S MAKE
A GREAT ALBUM. WE HAVE A DEAL?

09:34.810 --> 09:36.323
- YUP. WHATEVER.
- LET'S DO IT.

09:36.360 --> 09:37.395
- LET'S GO.
- ALL RIGHT.

09:37.430 --> 09:39.705
- YOU GOT A NICE,
FIRM "WHATEVER."

09:39.750 --> 09:42.127
- CROSBY, WOULD YOU PLEASE?
- NO, THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT.

09:42.160 --> 09:43.889
- LET'S GET CRACKIN'.
COME ON, LET'S MAKE THIS ALBUM.

09:43.920 --> 09:44.887
- YEAH. THIS FEELS MOMENTOUS.

09:44.920 --> 09:47.332
- OH, GOD, I AM SO,
SO SORRY, MR. CARLSON.

09:47.370 --> 09:50.237
LOOK, SOMETIMES EMOTIONS
ARE SO HARD FOR MAX TO READ.

09:50.270 --> 09:52.067
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT,
YOU KNOW,

09:52.100 --> 09:53.419
HE'S COME SUCH A LONG WAY.

09:53.450 --> 09:55.827
BUT I WILL SIT DOWN
WITH HIM TONIGHT

09:55.870 --> 09:57.349
AND I WILL EXPLAIN TO HIM

09:57.380 --> 09:59.268
WHY IT WAS SO INAPPROPRIATE
TO TAKE THAT PHOTO.

09:59.320 --> 10:01.720
I PROMISE YOU THIS WILL
NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

10:01.770 --> 10:02.907
IT WON'T. IT JUST WON'T.

10:02.940 --> 10:03.838
- THE GIRL WAS CRYING,
MRS. BRAVERMAN,

10:03.870 --> 10:06.350
AND SHE ASKED MAX
TO STOP TAKING PICTURES,

10:06.390 --> 10:08.358
AND HE WOULDN'T.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.971
SO NOW THE GIRL'S PARENTS
ARE FREAKING OUT AT ME,

10:11.020 --> 10:14.706
'CAUSE APPARENTLY THE FAMILY DOG
DIED THAT MORNING.

10:14.750 --> 10:16.365
- THEY HAVE A DO--
OH, WE HAVE A DOG. OTIS.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.265
WE RESCUED IT.
IF IT DIED IT WOULD BE...

10:18.300 --> 10:22.122
YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE WHAT
I CAN DO IS CALL THE PARENTS

10:22.170 --> 10:24.855
AND SOMETIMES ALL YOU NEED
IS A LITTLE COMMUNICATION

10:24.900 --> 10:26.652
AND JUST IT'LL SMOOTH
EVERYTHING OVER,

10:26.690 --> 10:28.203
AND IT'LL BE FINE. YOU'LL SEE.
- NOT NECESSARY.

10:28.240 --> 10:29.059
IT'S ALL CLEARED UP.
- IT'LL BE FINE. GOOD.

10:29.110 --> 10:32.136
- BUT I WANT
TO MOVE MAX TO LAYOUT.

10:32.180 --> 10:34.102
- WELL, LAYOUT'S WHERE
YOU MOVE PICTURES AROUND.

10:34.150 --> 10:36.698
ISN'T IT? WHERE YOU JUST
SORT OF PUT 'EM ON PAPER.

10:36.730 --> 10:37.412
- DESIGN IS A HUGE
PART OF THE YEARBOOK.

10:37.460 --> 10:38.859
- RIGHT.

10:38.910 --> 10:40.878
I GET IT, BUT SEE,
MAX IS A PHOTOGRAPHER.

10:40.910 --> 10:43.140
LIKE, HE'S--
HE'S LOVING THIS SO MUCH.

10:43.190 --> 10:44.737
AND IT'S SO GOOD FOR HIM.
- MM-HMM.

10:44.780 --> 10:47.772
AND I GET THAT YOU WANT TO DO
WHAT'S BEST FOR YOUR KID.

10:47.810 --> 10:50.984
BUT THERE'S 27 OF THEM IN HERE

10:51.020 --> 10:52.339
WHO WANT TO MAKE THIS
THE BEST YEARBOOK EVER.

10:52.370 --> 10:56.739
AND YEARBOOK IS ABOUT BEST HAIR
AND CUTEST COUPLE.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.234
- MM-HMM. I REMEMBER.
I WAS--I GET--

10:58.270 --> 11:01.751
- YEAH. GREAT.
MAX DOESN'T REALLY GET THAT.

11:01.790 --> 11:04.862
OKAY, WE SENT HIM
LAST WEEK TO GET PHOTOS

11:04.900 --> 11:07.175
FOR THE GIRL'S VARSITY GAME.
- MM-HMM.

11:07.210 --> 11:10.418
- AND HE STEPPED ONTO THE COURT
WITH THE CLOCK STILL RUNNING.

11:10.460 --> 11:13.145
- [sighs]
I DIDN'T KNOW THIS.

11:13.180 --> 11:14.875
I WISH SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE--
- NO BIG DEAL.

11:14.910 --> 11:16.013
HE CAN ALWAYS TAKE PICTURES.

11:16.050 --> 11:19.770
JUST NOT FOR THE YEARBOOK.

11:19.810 --> 11:21.983
- [sighs]

11:25.370 --> 11:26.917
- MRS. BRAVERMAN. HEY.

11:26.960 --> 11:29.474
- IT'S SARAH. HEY.

11:29.510 --> 11:30.431
COME IN.

11:30.480 --> 11:31.378
- [clears throat]

11:35.790 --> 11:38.418
- CAN I GET YOU
ANYTHING TO DRINK?

11:38.450 --> 11:40.964
- NO. LET'S JUST
JUMP RIGHT IN.

11:41.010 --> 11:42.034
- OKAY.

11:42.080 --> 11:46.005
UM, WHEN AMBER AND I
HAD OUR THING,

11:46.050 --> 11:48.245
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT
IT JUST BEING A RUSH.

11:48.290 --> 11:52.181
AND, YOU KNOW, SHE HASN'T SPOKEN
TO ME IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.

11:52.220 --> 11:53.915
- WHOA, WHOA, I'M SORRY, STOP.
STOP. STOP.

11:53.950 --> 11:55.918
- IT'S NOT PERSONAL TO YOU.
- NO, I THINK THAT WE'RE--

11:55.950 --> 11:57.121
WE'RE TALKING, MAYBE,
ABOUT DIFFERENT THINGS.

11:57.160 --> 12:00.948
I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE TOILET.
LIKE, ISN'T THERE A...

12:00.990 --> 12:01.957
THERE'S A BUSTED...

12:01.990 --> 12:03.161
TOILET HERE, RIGHT?

12:03.200 --> 12:07.307
- OH.
[laughs] RIGHT.

12:07.340 --> 12:09.160
FORGET EVERYTHING
I JUST SAID.

12:09.210 --> 12:10.472
- YEAH, NO, I GUESS
I NEED TO TALK TO...

12:10.520 --> 12:12.033
- NO, YOU DON'T
NEED TO ANYTHING.

12:12.070 --> 12:14.277
- TALK TO AMBER WHEN I--
- NO, NO, NO, NO, PLEASE, I--

12:14.310 --> 12:15.516
- WHERE'S THE TOILET?
- WOULD BE BETTER IF YOU DID--

12:15.560 --> 12:17.107
UPSTAIRS.
- YEAH, YEAH.

12:26.260 --> 12:27.978
- TEN FINGERS
AROUND TO MY HEAD

12:28.020 --> 12:31.183
GET DOWN WITH
OBLIVION

12:31.230 --> 12:34.119
POUR GLI'ITER
ALL OVER MY BED

12:34.160 --> 12:35.434
'CAUSE SOME MAGIC IS NOW...
- NO, NO, NO.

12:35.470 --> 12:38.166
STOP IT, STOP IT, STOP IT.
- A LITTLE BIT OF TIME IS--

12:38.200 --> 12:40.407
- LET'S DO, UM...
IT JUST--IT NEEDS MORE LUTE.

12:40.440 --> 12:42.067
I'M REALLY MISSING IT.
- MORE LUTE.

12:42.100 --> 12:44.546
- I JUST WANT IT TO ALMOST DROWN
OUT THE MARVIN GAYE SAMPLE.

12:44.590 --> 12:46.103
JUST ALMOST.

12:46.140 --> 12:48.449
- YOU WANT TO ALSO
PUT IN A MARVIN GAYE SAMPLE.

12:48.490 --> 12:50.958
- YEAH, WE'RE JUST GONNA
KEEP ON LAYERING AND LAYERING.

12:51.010 --> 12:53.592
I WANT IT TO BE, LIKE,
A SPLISH OF KANYE WEST,

12:53.630 --> 12:55.518
A SPLASH OF DAl-T PUNK,

12:55.560 --> 12:59.144
WITH A LITTLE SPRINKLE
OF T. REX ON THAT, BUT STILL US.

12:59.190 --> 13:02.944
- WELL, THOSE ARE A LITTLE BIT
CONFLICTING INGREDIENTS,

13:02.980 --> 13:04.845
BUT YEAH, I MEAN, I--
MAYBE IT'LL--

13:04.880 --> 13:06.871
- I JUST WANT THIS
TO SOUND LIKE

13:06.920 --> 13:08.808
NOTHING ANYONE'S
EVER HEARD BEFORE.

13:08.850 --> 13:11.978
- WE ARE ACCOMPLISHING THAT,
I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT.

13:12.030 --> 13:13.816
- HOW'S IT GOING?
- THANKS, MAN.

13:13.860 --> 13:14.679
PSSH.
[falsetto] MAGIC TIME.

13:14.720 --> 13:15.573
- YEAH? MAKING THE MAGIC?
ALL RIGHT.

13:15.620 --> 13:16.928
- YES, SIR.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.131
- GOING ALL RIGHT?

13:18.170 --> 13:21.139
- WE ARE GONNA TAKE
ANOTHER STAB AT HEAR ME NOW.

13:21.170 --> 13:22.444
- HEAR ME NOW?

13:22.490 --> 13:23.559
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE FIXING TO DO NOW.

13:23.590 --> 13:25.319
- WE ALREADY RECORDED THAT.

13:25.350 --> 13:27.079
THAT'S ONE OF THE THREE SONGS
WE ALREADY HAVE RECORDED.

13:27.110 --> 13:28.554
_ THAT'S RIGHT, BUT APPARENTLY,
ACCORDING TO THE ARTIST,

13:28.600 --> 13:30.522
IT HAD A STARTLING LACK
OF LUTE AND MARVIN GAYE.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.562
THAT'S WHAT WAS BROKE ABOUT IT.
- JUST TELL HIM NO.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.398
- I CAN'T TELL HIM NO...
- WE GO'ITA HUSTLE HERE.

13:35.430 --> 13:37.398
- BECAUSE THE NEW
MARCHING ORDERS HERE

13:37.430 --> 13:39.295
ARE THEIR VISION IS OUR VISION.
- I SEE. SO THIS IS MY FAULT.

13:39.330 --> 13:41.059
- SO IF THEY WANT A BUNCH
OF LUTE AND MARVIN GAYE,

13:41.090 --> 13:42.250
THEN BY GOD, THEIR LABEL'S
GONNA GIVE IT TO THEM.

13:42.300 --> 13:44.154
- IT'S THEIR VISION--THEIR
VISION WITHIN REASON, OKAY?

13:44.200 --> 13:45.849
TIME IS MONEY.
BE A PRODUCER.

13:45.890 --> 13:48.302
- HEY, I AM AWARE OF THE NEW
PARADIGM, WHICH YOU CREATED...

13:48.340 --> 13:49.409
- OH, YOU ARE.

13:49.440 --> 13:51.089
- AND ITS FINANCIAL
CONSEQUENCES.

13:51.140 --> 13:52.061
SO I'M DOING WHAT I CAN.
- LET'S JUST KEEP IT MOVING.

13:52.100 --> 13:54.239
- I'M GONNA KEEP IT MOVING.
- ALL RIGHT.

13:54.280 --> 13:56.339
- [tuning lute]

13:56.380 --> 13:58.029
THE LUTE IS READY.

13:58.070 --> 13:59.549
- NICE.

13:59.590 --> 14:02.275
- YEAH, I USED THE 2.8 LENS,
WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE REALLY

14:02.320 --> 14:03.935
ENHANCED THE NATURAL LIGHT
COMING IN FROM THE WINDOW.

14:03.980 --> 14:04.799
- YEAH, IT REALLY KIND OF

14:04.840 --> 14:07.593
CAPTURES THE AGONY
OF HIGH SCHOOL.

14:07.630 --> 14:09.018
I REMEMBER THERE WAS ALWAYS

14:09.050 --> 14:10.017
SOMEBODY CRYING
ABOUT SOME STUFF.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.278
- HEY.

14:11.330 --> 14:13.150
HI, GUYS.
- OH, HEY, LOOK WHO'S HERE.

14:13.190 --> 14:14.225
- I STILL HAVE 17 MINUTES LEI-T.

14:14.260 --> 14:18.082
- YEAH, WELL, TAKE IT UP
WITH THE BOSS, ALL RIGHT?

14:18.130 --> 14:19.358
- HEY, BUD.
- LOOK AT THIS ONE.

14:19.410 --> 14:20.434
THIS IS MY BEST ONE YET.

14:20.480 --> 14:22.050
- THIS IS BEAUTIFUL, HONEY.

14:22.100 --> 14:24.546
- HANK SAYS IT REALLY CAPTURES
THE AGONY OF HIGH SCHOOL.

14:24.580 --> 14:27.515
I THINK IT'S GONNA BE
THE COVER OF THE YEARBOOK.

14:27.550 --> 14:29.927
- YOU KNOW, BUDDY, THAT'S WHY
I'M HERE A LITTLE BIT EARLY.

14:29.970 --> 14:32.177
I, UM,
I JUST SPOKE WITH MR. CARLSON.

14:32.210 --> 14:34.587
AND THIS GIRL AND HER PARENTS
ARE REALLY, REALLY UPSET

14:34.630 --> 14:36.518
THAT YOU TOOK THIS PHOTO.
- WHY? IT'S A GREAT PICTURE.

14:36.560 --> 14:39.484
- I KNOW,
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PICTURE,

14:39.530 --> 14:41.452
BUT I MEAN, LOOK AT HOW
SHE'S FEELING IN THIS PHOTO.

14:41.500 --> 14:45.015
HOW DO YOU THINK
SHE FEELS RIGHT NOW HERE?

14:45.050 --> 14:46.324
- SAD.
- SAD. RIGHT.

14:46.360 --> 14:48.567
AND SOMETIMES
WHEN PEOPLE FEEL SAD,

14:48.610 --> 14:51.158
YOU KNOW, THEY WANT TO KEEP
THOSE EMOTIONS PRIVATE

14:51.200 --> 14:52.326
AND TO THEMSELVES.

14:52.370 --> 14:53.644
- THEN WHY IS SHE
DOING IT IN PUBLIC?

14:53.680 --> 14:54.840
- RIGHT. RIGHT. SHE WAS DOING IT
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HALLWAY.

14:54.890 --> 14:57.506
- SOMETIMES WHEN PEOPLE EXPRESS
THEIR EMOTIONS IN PUBLIC

14:57.550 --> 15:00.542
DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'RE
ALLOWED TO TAKE THEIR PHOTOS.

15:00.580 --> 15:01.444
I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO
ASK PERMISSION, I THINK.

15:01.480 --> 15:03.584
- WHY? HANK SAYS
PHOTOGRAPHY IS ALL ABOUT

15:03.620 --> 15:06.589
TRYING TO CAPTURE REAL MOMENTS.
- I STAND BY THAT.

15:06.620 --> 15:07.416
- RIGHT. AND THAT'S
A REAL MOMENT.

15:07.450 --> 15:09.554
- CERTAIN PLACES
AND CERTAIN TIMES,

15:09.590 --> 15:11.410
THERE ARE, FOR REAL MOMENTS.

15:11.460 --> 15:13.382
BUT THIS WAS NOT ONE OF THEM.
- THAT'S ONE OF THOSE TIMES.

15:13.420 --> 15:16.423
THAT RIGHT THERE
IN THAT PHOTO, THAT'S--

15:16.460 --> 15:18.212
THAT'S ONE OF THOSE TIMES.

15:18.260 --> 15:19.943
- THAT'S A GOOD MOMENT.
- BUDDY,

15:19.980 --> 15:22.084
CAN YOU WAIT
IN THE CAR FOR ME?

15:22.120 --> 15:24.259
- NO, I STILL HAVE
15 MINUTES LEI-T.

15:24.300 --> 15:25.562
I HAD 17 MINUTES,
BUT THEN YOU WASTED TWO OF THEM.

15:25.610 --> 15:27.157
- YOU KNOW WHAT, MAD MAX,

15:27.200 --> 15:28.462
WE GO'ITA FINISH UP
THAT PICTURE IN THE DARKROOM.

15:28.510 --> 15:29.477
YOU WANT TO GET THAT?

15:29.510 --> 15:31.091
- OKAY.
- IF THAT'S OKAY.

15:31.130 --> 15:32.233
- YEAH, IT'S FINE.

15:32.270 --> 15:33.999
- I'LL BE THERE
IN A COUPLE MINUTES.

15:34.030 --> 15:36.373
- I CALL HIM MAD MAX.
I THINK HE LIKES IT.

15:36.410 --> 15:37.547
I CAN'T TELL.
- LISTEN, HANK, I, UM...

15:37.590 --> 15:41.686
I'M SO THANKFUL FOR YOU,
FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING FOR MAX,

15:41.730 --> 15:45.723
BUT, YOU KNOW, I--
THAT PHOTO, IT'S NOT A JOKE.

15:45.770 --> 15:48.489
LIKE, IT'S GO'ITEN HIM--HE'S
IN SO MUCH TROUBLE FOR THAT.

15:48.530 --> 15:52.591
AND HE'S BEEN DEMOTED,
YOU KNOW, TO LAYOUT. LAYOUT.

15:52.640 --> 15:54.665
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, NO, LAYOUT?
WHAT'S HE GONNA DO IN LAYOUT?

15:54.710 --> 15:55.631
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?
- I DON'T KNOW.

15:55.670 --> 15:58.230
I GUESS PHOTOSHOP, RIGHT?

15:58.260 --> 16:00.979
THAT'S A GOOD THING FOR--
- THAT'S A JOKE, PHOTOSHOP.

16:01.020 --> 16:02.339
- YOU DON'T USE--

16:02.370 --> 16:03.337
- PHOTOSHOP SUCKS, OKAY?

16:03.370 --> 16:05.474
EVERYBODY DOES IT,
BUT IT'S NOT PHOTOGRAPHY.

16:05.510 --> 16:09.640
PHOTOGRAPHY IS IN THE DARKROOM,
MAKING PHOTOS LIKE THIS ONE.

16:09.690 --> 16:11.544
LOOK AT THIS. THIS IS GOOD.

16:11.590 --> 16:14.036
I MEAN, IT'S REALLY GOOD.

16:14.070 --> 16:17.176
I MEAN, SUBJECT MA'ITER ASIDE,
WHICH IS A KNOCKOUT,

16:17.210 --> 16:18.552
IT'S GOT COMPOSITION,
IT'S GOT DEPTH,

16:18.590 --> 16:20.478
GREAT USE OF LIGHT.

16:20.530 --> 16:23.283
THAT KID IS A PHOTOGRAPHER.

16:23.320 --> 16:28.087
HE SHOULD BE TAKING PICTURES.
SHOULDN'T BE ON LAYOUT.

16:33.570 --> 16:36.459
- SO CAN WE GET THAT
LEVELED

16:36.510 --> 16:38.569
BY NEXT l'JTHURSDAY?

16:38.610 --> 16:41.056
ALL THIS. YEAH.
- YEAH. GREAT.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.647
I REALLY WANT TO GET STARTED
ON THE FOUNDATION.

16:42.690 --> 16:43.714
WHAT ARE THOSE?

16:43.760 --> 16:46.445
- THAT'S THE WINDOWS.
- RIGHT.

16:46.480 --> 16:49.199
HOLD THE BEAT ON THEM.
- THE--THE--

16:49.240 --> 16:50.719
THE WINDOWS YOU CALLED ME
ABOUT THIS MORNING.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.728
FACING WEST AND SOUTH.
- MM-HMM. NO, I KNOW.

16:52.770 --> 16:54.169
IT'S JUST THERE'S
A BETTER WAY

16:54.220 --> 16:55.790
TO INTEGRATE THE LIGHT
AND THE PRIVACY HERE.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.831
SO I JUST WANT
TO TAKE ONE MORE LOOK

16:57.870 --> 16:59.838
BEFORE WE SET THAT IN STONE.

16:59.880 --> 17:01.529
- OKAY, UM...

17:01.570 --> 17:03.458
YOU KNOW, I'D LOVE TO HAVE
A CONVERSATION AT SOME POINT

17:03.500 --> 17:05.775
ABOUT OUR CREATIVE PROCESS
TOGETHER.

17:05.810 --> 17:07.391
- SURE. YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT BOUNDARIES?

17:07.440 --> 17:11.672
- UH...
UH, NO.

17:11.720 --> 17:12.675
YEAH.
[chuckles] YEAH.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.859
- LET'S HAVE DINNER.

17:14.890 --> 17:16.403
TONIGHT.

17:16.440 --> 17:18.442
NO, NOT TONIGHT.

17:18.480 --> 17:19.856
UM, TOMORROW.

17:19.900 --> 17:21.208
YEAH.

17:21.240 --> 17:23.344
GREAT. WE'LL GET DINNER
AND A MARTINI.

17:23.380 --> 17:25.109
I ALWAYS THINK
A BOUNDARY CONVERSATION

17:25.140 --> 17:26.550
GOES DOWN MUCH BETTER
WITH A MARTINI.

17:26.590 --> 17:27.511
- [laughs] RIGHT.
- OR TWO. [chuckles]

17:30.630 --> 17:32.860
- HI.
- HEY.

17:32.910 --> 17:34.252
- YOU'RE HOME SO LATE.

17:34.290 --> 17:36.349
- I HAD A REALLY
UNCOMFORTABLE

17:36.400 --> 17:37.833
CONVERSATION
WITH YOUR MOM TODAY.

17:37.880 --> 17:40.257
- UH, WHEN--
WHEN DID YOU TALK TO HER?

17:40.300 --> 17:41.289
- JOEL SENT ME OVER THERE
TO FIX A TOILET SHE--

17:41.330 --> 17:45.642
IT DOESN'T MA'ITER.
WH--WHAT'S GOING ON THERE?

17:45.680 --> 17:46.715
- WHAT DID SHE SAY TO YOU?

17:46.750 --> 17:49.787
- SHE--SHE SAID THAT

17:49.820 --> 17:52.266
I GUESS SHE SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT THE WEDDING OR ME OR...

17:52.310 --> 17:53.618
- [sighs]

17:53.650 --> 17:54.787
- AND NOW YOU GUYS AREN'T
TALKING TO EACH OTHER?

17:54.830 --> 17:55.854
I FEEL LIKE YOU SHOULD'VE
MENTIONED THAT.

17:55.900 --> 18:00.109
- HONESTLY, IT WAS NOT
THAT BIG OF A DEAL, OKAY?

18:00.140 --> 18:01.653
- WELL, IT'S A BIG ENOUGH DEAL
THAT SHE APOLOGIZED TO ME

18:01.700 --> 18:03.725
WHILE I STOOD THERE
LIKE AN IDIOT

18:03.770 --> 18:05.169
HAVING NO IDEA WHAT
SHE'S TALKING ABOUT.

18:05.220 --> 18:06.380
- OKAY, I--

18:06.430 --> 18:07.351
- I JUST DON'T GET
WHY YOU'RE AV--

18:07.390 --> 18:08.357
WHY DON'T YOU WANT TO TELL ME?

18:08.390 --> 18:09.732
IT'S LIKE YOU DON'T TRUST ME
OR SOMETHING.

18:09.770 --> 18:10.873
- WHAT? RYAN, WHAT?

18:10.910 --> 18:13.777
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH TRUST.
- THEN JUST TELL ME.

18:13.810 --> 18:16.802
- OKAY, WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO KNOW?

18:16.850 --> 18:18.010
- I HAVE NO IDEA.
- YOU KNOW HOW SHE IS.

18:18.060 --> 18:21.188
WHAT--SHE SAYS STUFF AND MAKES
A BIG DEAL OUT OF THINGS.

18:21.230 --> 18:22.470
- LIKE WHAT?

18:22.510 --> 18:24.671
- SHE WAS PROJECTING
ISSUES THAT SHE HAS

18:24.720 --> 18:27.188
AND HER OWN FEARS
AND INSECURITIES

18:27.240 --> 18:29.583
ABOUT HER SITUATION.
- WHAT SITUATION?

18:29.620 --> 18:30.689
- HER MARRIAGE,
YOU KNOW, ONTO MINE.

18:30.730 --> 18:33.415
AND IT WAS REALLY UNFAIR
AND STUPID AND--

18:33.450 --> 18:35.509
- LIKE YOUR DAD STUFF?
LIKE STUFF--

18:35.560 --> 18:37.414
LIKE SHE'S COMPARING ME
TO YOUR DAD OR SOMETHING?

18:37.460 --> 18:40.384
- NO, SHE WAS MAKING
A BIG DEAL ABOUT--

18:40.420 --> 18:41.557
ABOUT THE FAMILY THING.

18:41.600 --> 18:42.589
ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOUR
FAMILY'S NOT GONNA BE THERE--

18:42.630 --> 18:45.519
- I DON'T GET WHY
SHE'S SO OBSESSED WITH THAT.

18:45.570 --> 18:47.629
- I DON'T EITHER. I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU'RE UPSET WITH ME.

18:47.670 --> 18:49.319
I'M ON YOUR SIDE ABOUT THIS.
- OKAY, OKAY, I'M SORRY.

18:49.360 --> 18:50.679
- THIS IS WHY I DIDN'T
WANT TO BRING IT UP,

18:50.710 --> 18:51.563
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MA'ITER.
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

18:51.610 --> 18:52.884
I'M NOT MAD AT YOU.

18:52.920 --> 18:54.467
I'M JUST TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.

18:54.510 --> 18:55.670
SORRY, I JUST FEEL LIKE--
- IT'S OKAY, I JUST--

18:55.720 --> 18:57.403
- IF THERE'S A CASE AGAINST ME,
I FEEL LIKE I'M ENTITLED

18:57.440 --> 18:58.577
TO KNOW WHAT IT IS.

18:58.620 --> 19:00.303
- NO, IT'S--SHE JUST--

19:00.340 --> 19:02.308
THIS IS WHAT SHE DOES.
SHE JUST--

19:02.340 --> 19:04.160
IT'S LIKE SHE, LIKE,
HOLDS ON TO THINGS

19:04.210 --> 19:08.556
AND THEN SPEWS THEM BACK AT ME
ALL AT ONCE, YOU KNOW.

19:08.590 --> 19:10.899
- WELL, WHAT THINGS?
- I DON'T--

19:10.940 --> 19:12.658
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I DON'T KNOW--

19:12.700 --> 19:14.907
- YOU SAID "THINGS." YOU SAID
THINGS THAT SHE'S SAYING.

19:14.940 --> 19:16.908
SHE KEEPS BRINGING STUFF UP--
WHAT'S--

19:16.940 --> 19:18.737
- BRINGING UP THINGS
FROM OUR PAST

19:18.770 --> 19:20.874
THAT AREN'T RELEVANT ANYMORE.
- LIKE WHAT?

19:20.910 --> 19:23.708
- OUR PROBLEMS LAST YEAR.
JUST LIKE THE--

19:23.740 --> 19:24.638
- WHAT PROBLEMS?
- WHAT PROBLEMS?

19:24.680 --> 19:26.329
- [scoffs]
WELL, WHAT DID YOU TELL HER?

19:26.370 --> 19:29.646
- YOU KNOW, WITH THE CAR
AND ALL THAT STUFF.

19:29.680 --> 19:31.534
WHAT?
RYAN, SHE SAW THE CAR.

19:31.580 --> 19:34.265
I WAS GOING TO THEIR HOUSE
FOR CHRISTMAS.

19:34.310 --> 19:37.234
- DOES SHE KNOW ABOUT
THE FIGHT AT THE FUNERAL?

19:37.270 --> 19:40.990
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU WANT ME TO SAY.

19:41.040 --> 19:42.860
AT THE TIME...

19:42.900 --> 19:45.698
BUT THAT DOESN'T MA'ITER.

19:45.730 --> 19:49.689
- IT MATTERS TO ME.

19:49.740 --> 19:51.594
- BUT YOU NEVER KNOW

19:51.630 --> 19:54.736
WELL, NOW, YOU NEVER KNOW

20:00.500 --> 20:02.468
- HEY.
OH.

20:02.510 --> 20:04.740
[clattering]

20:04.780 --> 20:06.850
WHAT HAPPENED?

20:06.890 --> 20:08.437
- I HAD TO PULL OUT
A SECTION OF THE WALL

20:08.480 --> 20:10.300
TO BE ABLE TO
GET TO THE BUSTED PIPE.

20:10.340 --> 20:14.822
- OH, NO. IT LOOKS LIKE
A LOT OF WORK.

20:14.860 --> 20:16.896
HOW LONG IS IT GONNA
TAKE YOU, DO YOU THINK?

20:16.930 --> 20:18.374
- WELL, I HAVE TO PUT
THE DRYWALL BACK UP AND...

20:18.420 --> 20:19.967
- RIGHT.
- TOILET BACK IN.

20:20.010 --> 20:21.796
- OKAY. I BROUGHT
YOU SOME COFFEE.

20:21.840 --> 20:24.968
- OH, NO, THANK YOU. THANKS.
- OH.

20:25.010 --> 20:27.251
SO, UM...
- I'M GONNA HAVE TO MOVE THAT.

20:27.290 --> 20:29.736
- OH, I'M--DON'T--
I'LL GET IT.

20:29.780 --> 20:33.489
UH...HAS A LOT
OF PRODUCTS, HUH?

20:33.540 --> 20:36.395
UM, WHAT CAUSED IT?
COULD YOU TELL?

20:36.440 --> 20:39.500
- PROPHYLACTICS.
- WHAT?

20:39.540 --> 20:41.269
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
LIKE, FLUSHING? FLUSHING THEM?

20:41.300 --> 20:42.335
EWW...

20:42.370 --> 20:45.066
- MRS. BRAVERMAN, IT'S--
- YEAH.

20:45.100 --> 20:46.681
- IT'S PRETTY TIGHT IN HERE.
JUST TRYING TO--

20:46.720 --> 20:48.278
- OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

20:48.310 --> 20:51.655
WILL YOU PLEASE CALL ME SARAH?

20:51.690 --> 20:53.385
- RIGHT.
- PLEASE?

20:53.420 --> 20:55.729
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU, I WAS JUST
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT...

20:55.770 --> 20:57.283
- NO, NO, DON'T BE SORRY.
- A TIMELINE TO TELL MY TENANT.

20:57.320 --> 20:59.424
- IT'S GONNA GET A LOT WORSE
BEFORE IT GETS BE'ITER.

20:59.460 --> 21:03.419
- RIGHT. HMM.

21:06.090 --> 21:08.422
- HELLO.
- HEY!

21:08.470 --> 21:09.437
H EY, PARTN ER!

21:09.470 --> 21:11.051
COME ON OVER!

21:11.090 --> 21:12.705
- YOU DIDN'T START WITHOUT ME,
DID YOU, GRANDPA?

21:12.750 --> 21:15.025
- HECK, NO, I'M NOT GONNA
DO ANYTHING WITHOUT YOU.

21:15.060 --> 21:16.618
THIS IS OUR PROJECT.

21:16.650 --> 21:18.618
- HE'S BEEN LOOKING
FORWARD TO THIS ALL DAY.

21:18.650 --> 21:21.448
- WELL, HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE.
- GOOD. [laughs]

21:21.480 --> 21:23.857
- OKAY, HERE YOU GO.
- ALL RIGHT.

21:23.900 --> 21:25.447
- THERE'S THE MANUAL.
- OKAY...

21:25.490 --> 21:27.481
- YOU START AND WE'LL SEE
WHAT WE CAN COME UP WITH HERE.

21:27.520 --> 21:30.409
- OKAY. "REPLACE..."
- GOOD.

21:30.460 --> 21:31.108
- "THE...

21:31.150 --> 21:37.077
CARBOR-A-TEER. "

21:37.120 --> 21:38.109
- CARBU RETOR.

21:38.150 --> 21:40.562
- REPLACE THE CARBURETOR.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.295
- THAT'S IT.
- OKAY.

21:44.130 --> 21:45.358
- OH, GOD, I LOVE THAT CAR.

21:45.400 --> 21:48.710
THAT CAR IS
THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN.

21:48.750 --> 21:50.433
- WELL, I DON'T.
I HATE THE DAMN THING.

21:50.480 --> 21:53.608
- WHAT? MOM.

21:53.650 --> 21:54.958
MOM.
- NOTHING.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.786
NOBODY CARES WHAT I THINK.

21:56.830 --> 21:59.867
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

21:59.900 --> 22:02.869
- HE'S JUST COMPLETELY
SHUT ME OUT.

22:02.900 --> 22:04.344
- DAD HAS?

22:04.390 --> 22:05.243
- YEAH, DAD.

22:05.280 --> 22:08.044
- WELL, YOU CAN
TALK TO ME ABOUT IT.

22:08.080 --> 22:09.559
- ALL I ASKED HIM TO DO

22:09.600 --> 22:11.113
WAS TO HAVE A LOOK
AT A CONDO WITH ME.

22:11.150 --> 22:12.014
JUST LOOK.

22:12.050 --> 22:14.666
SO WE COULD DISCUSS
THE POSSIBILITY

22:14.710 --> 22:17.599
OF WHAT OUR ACT THREE
MIGHT LOOK LIKE.

22:17.640 --> 22:20.393
AND HE GOES AND HE BUYS THAT
PIECE OF JUNK TO SHUT ME UP.

22:20.440 --> 22:24.672
THAT'S NOT OUR ACT THREE.
IT'S HIS ACT THREE.

22:24.720 --> 22:26.995
- YOU WANT TO SELL THE HOUSE?

22:27.030 --> 22:29.544
- NO. WELL...

22:29.580 --> 22:31.161
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE.

22:31.210 --> 22:33.485
YOU KNOW, THE TAYLORS GOT A LOT
OF MONEY FOR THEIR HOUSE.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.897
- YEAH.
- THEY GOT OVER ASKING PRICE.

22:35.940 --> 22:37.658
THIS IS A BETTER HOUSE.
- YEAH.

22:37.700 --> 22:40.521
- IT'S A BIGGER HOUSE.
IT'S TOO BIG A HOUSE.

22:40.560 --> 22:41.868
YOU KNOW,
IT'S A LOT OF UPKEEP.

22:41.910 --> 22:43.070
IT'S A LOT OF HOUSE
FOR TWO PEOPLE.

22:43.120 --> 22:44.451
YOU KIDS ARE
ALL GROWN AND GONE.

22:44.500 --> 22:48.778
WE COULD DO
A LOT OF THINGS THAT...

22:48.810 --> 22:50.732
THAT I HAVEN'T DONE.

22:50.780 --> 22:51.678
THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS
I WANT TO DO

22:51.710 --> 22:53.120
AND I WANT TO DO THEM
WHILE I'M STILL

22:53.160 --> 22:55.503
YOUNG ENOUGH
TO ENJOY DOING THEM.

22:55.540 --> 22:59.647
DO YOU KNOW I'VE NEVER BEEN
OUT OF THE COUNTRY?

22:59.680 --> 23:02.160
- MOM, I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE
THINKING ABOUT ALL THIS STUFF.

23:02.200 --> 23:05.715
- [chuckles] WHY WOULD IT
EVEN OCCUR TO YOU?

23:05.760 --> 23:08.137
JOEL. HE NEVER SHUT YOU OUT.

23:10.690 --> 23:12.931
LISTEN, UM,

23:12.970 --> 23:14.449
DON'T MENTION THIS
TO THE OTHERS, OKAY?

23:14.490 --> 23:17.175
EVERYONE IS SO EMOTIONAL
ABOUT THIS HOUSE.

23:17.220 --> 23:18.733
- NO, I WON'T.

23:18.770 --> 23:19.873
- I DIDN'T EVEN MEAN
TO BURDEN YOU WITH IT.

23:19.910 --> 23:22.140
- THAT'S FINE. MOM,
I'M REALLY GLAD THAT YOU DID.

23:22.190 --> 23:23.634
IAM.

23:23.670 --> 23:26.150
- IT'S JUST A LOT
OF YEARS, JULIA.

23:26.190 --> 23:28.750
IT'S A WHOLE LOT OF YEARS
WITH YOUR DAD.

23:28.780 --> 23:30.953
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY,
1--

23:33.920 --> 23:35.433
I LOST MY VOICE
IN THE RELATIONSHIP.

23:35.480 --> 23:40.065
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO GET IT BACK.

23:41.930 --> 23:44.819
- INCORPORATING THE OUTDOORS,
EDIBLE GARDENS

23:44.870 --> 23:47.077
AND SLIDING GLASS DOORS...
- YEAH.

23:47.110 --> 23:48.759
- THIS NATURAL FLOW BETWEEN
THE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE.

23:48.800 --> 23:51.598
- RIGHT, RAW MATERIALS,
AND THAT WARM COLOR YOU USE.

23:51.630 --> 23:53.245
- YEAH. THANK YOU, YEAH.

23:53.290 --> 23:55.520

WISH YOU GREW UP IN BUT DIDN'T.

23:55.570 --> 23:59.119
- YEAH. YEAH, IT'S THAT HOUSE.
- YEAH.

23:59.160 --> 24:02.505
- YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME
RAISE MY GAME, JOEL.

24:02.540 --> 24:04.883
- [chuckles] WELL, I HAVEN'T
EVEN BUILT ANYTHING FOR YOU YET.

24:04.920 --> 24:06.672
- NOT YET.

24:06.720 --> 24:07.812
BUT YOU DIDN'T COME HERE
TO DISCUSS DESIGN.

24:07.860 --> 24:09.259
YOU WANTED TO TALK
ABOUT BOUNDARIES.

24:09.300 --> 24:13.646
- YES.
- FIRE AWAY.

24:13.690 --> 24:15.965
- THANK YOU.
I JUST THOUGHT I'D--

24:16.000 --> 24:17.649
IT'D BE GOOD TO GET
OUT OF THE WAY

24:17.690 --> 24:19.169
BEFORE WE GET
INTO A SITUATION

24:19.210 --> 24:22.202
WHERE,
YOU KNOW, WE'RE BEHIND

24:22.250 --> 24:25.697
OR WE'RE EATING INTO
THE PROFITS OF MY TEAM.

24:25.740 --> 24:28.698
AND I'VE JUST HEARD
HORROR STORIES FROM MY WIFE

24:28.740 --> 24:30.662
WHO WATCHED ALL THESE
YOUNG COMPANIES MAKE--

24:30.710 --> 24:32.871
- S0 IS THIS
YOUR WIFE TALKING?

24:32.910 --> 24:34.605
- NO.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.221
- SORRY. NO FILTER.

24:36.260 --> 24:37.568
- NO, THAT'S OKAY.
[chuckles]

24:37.610 --> 24:41.501
NO, BUT WE'RE A TEAM,
MY WIFE AND I.

24:41.540 --> 24:42.677
- MM-HMM. I GET IT.

24:42.720 --> 24:45.188
WELL, LOOK,
I'VE NEVER BEEN MARRIED.

24:45.240 --> 24:46.377
NOT IN ANY TRADITIONAL SENSE.

24:46.410 --> 24:48.617
BUT IN THIS MARRIAGE,
THE ONE THAT YOU AND I ARE IN,

24:48.650 --> 24:51.687
THIS IS ABOUT THE LONG HAUL.

24:51.730 --> 24:55.177
THIS IS ABOUT, YOU KNOW,
PU'ITING THE SWEAT EQUITY IN NOW

24:55.210 --> 24:56.962
AND NEVER GOING
BACK TO THE CLIENT

24:57.010 --> 24:58.591
AND ASKING FOR MORE MONEY

24:58.630 --> 25:02.316
AND COMING IN UNDER BUDGET
AND MAKING BEAUTIFUL HOMES.

25:02.360 --> 25:04.567
THE HOMES THAT YOU WISHED
YOU GREW UP IN BUT YOU DIDN'T.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.739
- RIGHT.

25:06.780 --> 25:09.567
- AND THEN DOING IT
AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN.

25:09.610 --> 25:11.532
AND MAKING FRICKIN'
LOADS OF MONEY.

25:11.570 --> 25:13.572
[both laugh]

25:13.610 --> 25:17.125
- WELL, YOU SOLD ME.
- I DID? THAT WORKS?

25:17.170 --> 25:18.990
- YEAH, THAT SOUNDS--
THAT SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD.

25:19.030 --> 25:20.236
- GOOD.

25:20.270 --> 25:22.613

I MEAN, THAT--THIS IS IT, RIGHT?
THAT'S GOOD.

25:35.980 --> 25:37.698
- IT'S BEEN THE SAME
FOR TWO DAYS.

25:37.740 --> 25:38.661
- PFFFI'.
THAT WAS TERRIBLE.

25:38.700 --> 25:39.667
LET'S DO THAT ONE MORE TIME.

25:39.710 --> 25:40.665
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE GOT IT.

25:40.710 --> 25:43.292
WITH ALL THOSE TAKES, WE GOT IT.
WE'RE DONE.

25:43.330 --> 25:45.184
SOLID GOLD. I MEAN, BOOM.

25:45.230 --> 25:46.982

25:48.020 --> 25:50.193
HOW 'BOUT THAT?
LET'S DO IT ONE MORE TIME.

25:50.230 --> 25:52.369
- IT'S YOUR VISION.
ONE MORE TIME. JUST ONE MORE.

25:52.410 --> 25:53.741
ONE MORE TIME.
- YOU'RE SO EASY TO WORK WITH.

25:53.790 --> 25:57.089
- OKAY, JUST ONE MORE.

25:57.140 --> 25:59.028

26:00.760 --> 26:01.897
I THINK EVERYONE'S
PRETTY EXHAUSTED,

26:01.930 --> 26:04.239
SO LET'S JUST

26:04.280 --> 26:05.383
COME BACK RESTED IN THE MORNING,

26:05.420 --> 26:07.001

26:07.040 --> 26:08.769
- I'M NOT GOING HOME ON
A PIECE OF CRAP TAKE LIKE THAT.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.904

26:17.880 --> 26:19.700

26:19.750 --> 26:21.058
- LOOK, WE NEED

26:22.400 --> 26:24.265
- HIS LABEL DROPPED HIM
FOR A REASON.

26:24.300 --> 26:26.359
HE HAS SOME CRAZY,
PSEUDO-ARTISTIC FANTASY

26:26.410 --> 26:28.128
OF HOW THIS ALBUM'S
GONNA TURN OUT.

26:28.170 --> 26:29.717
IT'S GOING TO SUCK.
IT'S GONNA BE CRAP!

26:29.760 --> 26:30.852
- OKAY, WELL,
WE CAN'T LET IT SUCK, OKAY?

26:30.890 --> 26:32.334
WE GO'ITA MAKE IT GOOD!
- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

26:32.380 --> 26:33.586
SPRINKLE MY MAGIC
FAIRY DUST ON IT.

26:33.620 --> 26:35.064
- WELL, I WISH YOU WOULD, OKAY?
- I'M NOT A PSYCHOLOGIST.

26:35.110 --> 26:36.065
- WE'VE GOT A LOT
RIDING ON THIS!

26:36.110 --> 26:37.372
- YOU WANTED THIS.
- TAKE THE LUNCHEONE'ITE

26:37.420 --> 26:38.170
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
- I WOULD HAVE NEVER

26:38.210 --> 26:38.892
TRIED TO TAKE IT
TO THE NEXT LEVEL

26:38.940 --> 26:41.272
WITH A BRAND-NEW BABY AT HOME!

26:41.320 --> 26:44.380
I'VE GOT A LOT GOING ON.
I CAN'T BE HERE WITH THIS IDIOT

26:44.430 --> 26:45.738
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, OKAY?
- HEY, TAKE A BREATH.

26:45.770 --> 26:47.214
THERE'S NEVER
A RIGHT TIME, OKAY?

26:47.260 --> 26:48.386
THINK IT WAS EASY FOR ME?
- WHAT?

26:48.430 --> 26:50.421
- YOU THINK IT WAS EASY FOR ME
WHEN YOU CAME TO ME WITH

26:50.470 --> 26:51.664
THE IDEA OF THE LUNCHEONE'ITE
WHEN CHRISTINA WAS PREGNANT?

26:51.710 --> 26:53.291
- OH, WHEN I CAME TO YOU

26:53.330 --> 26:54.638
WITH THE GREAT IDEA
FOR THE LUNCHEONE'ITE?

26:54.680 --> 26:55.908
I'M LEAVING.
- HERE'S THE DEAL.

26:55.950 --> 26:57.087
YOU CAN'T LEAVE
UNTIL WE FINISH THIS SONG.

26:57.130 --> 26:59.644
- I CAN'T LEAVE.
- NO, YOU CAN'T.

26:59.680 --> 27:00.988
YOU CAN'T LEAVE, CROSBY.

27:01.030 --> 27:03.021
- WELL, THAT OPENED.
WHAT IS THIS?

27:03.060 --> 27:05.642
HUH. I WONDER IF...
- CROSBY...

27:05.690 --> 27:07.897
- OH, WOW, I CAN LEAVE.

27:07.930 --> 27:09.204
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT,
'CAUSE I'M AN ADULT.

27:09.240 --> 27:12.346
- DON'T YOU GO DOWN
THOSE STAIRS. DON'T--

27:12.380 --> 27:14.177
DON'T YOU LEAVE THE STUDIO.
CROSBY, I SWEAR TO GOD.

27:14.210 --> 27:16.269
CROSBY, I--

27:16.320 --> 27:18.311
- [claps]
I HOPE THAT WAS A BEER RUN,

27:18.360 --> 27:21.215
'CAUSE WE'RE NOT STOPPING,
RIGHT?

27:22.710 --> 27:27.226
- LET'S TAKE FIVE.

27:27.260 --> 27:30.195
JUST TAKING FIVE.

27:30.230 --> 27:32.084
TAKING FIVE.

27:35.170 --> 27:37.684
- OR A PURPLE DRAGON
WITH A BLUE CAR.

27:42.100 --> 27:44.898
- PRETTY COOL CAKES.

27:44.930 --> 27:46.170

IT'S ABOUT CHOICES.

28:51.930 --> 28:53.921

ENOUGH SAID. YEAH.

31:09.520 --> 31:10.999
DONE.

31:11.040 --> 31:12.348
AND GOOD NEWS HERE.

31:12.380 --> 31:13.620
THE LESSON THAT WE'VE GOTTEN
IS YOU NOW KNOW

31:13.660 --> 31:15.036
YOU CAN'T SNAKE A TOILET BOWL.

31:15.080 --> 31:18.379
- AND YOU KNOW
YOU CAN'T FLUSH YOUR CONDOMS.

31:18.420 --> 31:20.422
- MR. RADFORD,
THANK YOU SO MUCH

31:20.460 --> 31:21.597
FOR TAKING THE TIME
TO MEET WITH US.

31:21.630 --> 31:24.281
AFTER I LEI-T MR. CARLSON
I SPOKE WITH A FAMILY FRIEND.

31:24.330 --> 31:28.562
HE'S A PHOTOGRAPHER.
GREAT PHOTOGRAPHER.

31:28.610 --> 31:29.429
HANK RIZZOLI.
YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM.

31:29.470 --> 31:30.368
- MM-MM.

31:30.400 --> 31:32.152
- REALLY, REALLY
WELL-KNOWN IN BERKELEY.

31:32.200 --> 31:33.918
HE'S LIKE THE ANNIE LIEBOWITZ
OF BERKELEY. HE'S AMAZING.

31:33.960 --> 31:36.292
WONDERFUL PERSON, TOO.

31:36.340 --> 31:39.332
HE REALLY BELIEVES THAT MAX
HAS TALENT AS A PHOTOGRAPHER.

31:39.380 --> 31:40.688
AND HE SHOULD BE
TAKING PICTURES

31:40.720 --> 31:42.608
OF THE YEARBOOK--
FOR THE YEARBOOK.

31:42.650 --> 31:44.094
- OKAY, I THOUGHT I MADE IT
CLEAR THAT THIS WASN'T

31:44.140 --> 31:44.959
ABOUT TALENT, MRS. BRAVERMAN.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.059
- YOU MADE IT CLEAR,
BUT YOU KNOW,

31:47.110 --> 31:49.271
I SAT DOWN WITH MY HUSBAND,
WE TALKED TO MAX,

31:49.320 --> 31:50.696
SO THIS WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

31:50.730 --> 31:52.482
- THE DECISION'S BEEN MADE.

31:52.530 --> 31:53.554
- I KNOW THE DECISION'S
BEEN MADE.

31:53.600 --> 31:54.453
MR. RADFORD, COULD YOU MAYBE

31:54.490 --> 31:57.186
TALK TO MR. CARLSON
ABOUT LAST YEAR

31:57.220 --> 32:00.087
AND HOW GREAT MAX WAS WITH
PRESIDENT OF STUDENT COUNCIL,

32:00.120 --> 32:01.087
HOW MUCH HE THRIVED,

32:01.120 --> 32:02.599
AND HOW WELL HE DID.

32:02.640 --> 32:04.744
AND, YOU KNOW, WE HAD SOME
SPEED BUMPS HERE AND THERE,

32:04.780 --> 32:07.226
BUT IN THE END,
HE DID PHENOMENAL.

32:07.270 --> 32:09.056
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

32:09.090 --> 32:11.502
- HE DID DO WELL. AND I'M HAPPY
THAT MAX HAD THAT EXPERIENCE.

32:11.550 --> 32:14.189
BUT I GOTTA BE HONEST
WITH YOU.

32:14.240 --> 32:14.990
IT WAS REALLY TOUGH ON
THE REST OF THE STUDENT COUNCIL.

32:15.030 --> 32:17.271
- WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?
I DON'T--

32:17.310 --> 32:19.414
- I MEAN, I THINK THE REASON
THAT IT WORKED OUT AT ALL,

32:19.450 --> 32:21.304
THE ONLY REASON
IT WORKED OUT AT ALL,

32:21.350 --> 32:22.305
WAS BECAUSE MAX
WAS IN CHARGE.

32:22.350 --> 32:24.762
BUT I STILL HAD TO PUT OUT
A LOT OF FIRES.

32:24.800 --> 32:26.483
- LIKE WHAT?
NOBODY TOLD ME ANY OF THIS.

32:26.530 --> 32:28.691
- I WAS GLAD
TO TRY TO MAKE IT WORK.

32:28.730 --> 32:30.766
BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS
GONNA BE GOOD FOR MAX.

32:30.810 --> 32:35.019
BUT THIS TIME I'VE GOT TO
AGREE WITH MR. CARLSON.

32:35.050 --> 32:35.903
WE CAN'T HAVE HIM DOING
PHOTOGRAPHY FOR THE YEARBOOK.

32:35.950 --> 32:39.989
IT'S JUST NOT FAIR
TO THE OTHER KIDS.

32:42.020 --> 32:44.989
- CROSBY JUST HAPPENED
TO BE THERE?

32:45.030 --> 32:48.739
- YEAH,
HE WAS PICKING UP DIAPERS.

32:48.790 --> 32:50.098
- HOW MUCH
HAD YOU HAD TO DRINK?

32:50.140 --> 32:52.711
- NOT TOO MUCH.
- YEAH.

32:52.760 --> 32:55.991
- I WAS, YOU KNOW,
TRYING TO BE SAFE, SO...

32:56.040 --> 32:58.031
- THAT'S SMART.
- MM-HMM.

32:58.070 --> 33:01.107
- OKAY, SO IF YOU HADN'T
BEEN DRINKING SO MUCH,

33:01.150 --> 33:05.007
THEN, UM, MAY I ASK
THE STORY BEHIND THIS?

33:05.050 --> 33:06.802
- UH, THAT IS A CAKE.

33:06.840 --> 33:10.355
IT'S, UH...

33:10.400 --> 33:12.152
LOOKED SO MUCH BETTER
LAST NIGHT.

33:12.190 --> 33:13.327
- MM-HMM.
- THAT CAKE.

33:13.370 --> 33:16.498
BUT IT WAS, UH,
SOMETHING I WAS BUYING

33:16.540 --> 33:20.169
FOR THE, UH--I WAS, UH...
DRUNK.

33:20.200 --> 33:21.781
- YEAH.
- I WAS DRUNK.

33:21.820 --> 33:24.505
- YEAH.

33:24.550 --> 33:27.405
- AND I'M GONNA CHOOSE
TO NOT BE UPSET

33:27.450 --> 33:31.341
ABOUT THE FACT THAT
YOU WERE OUT VERY LATE

33:31.380 --> 33:34.201
DRUNK WITH PEET
AND JUST LIED TO ME ABOUT IT

33:34.250 --> 33:37.720
UNLESS YOU TELL ME THAT
I SHOULD BE UPSET ABOUT IT.

33:37.770 --> 33:42.423
- YOU SHOULD NOT
BE UPSET.

33:42.460 --> 33:43.358
- GOOD. THEN I'M NOT.

33:43.400 --> 33:45.561
- GOOD.

33:45.600 --> 33:46.806
- OKAY.

33:46.850 --> 33:49.125
SO HOW'D IT GO?

33:49.160 --> 33:52.288
- GOOD. GOOD, ACTUALLY.
YOU KNOW, UM...

33:52.340 --> 33:53.819
I'M REALLY GLAD YOU TOLD ME
TO TALK TO HER ABOUT IT.

33:53.850 --> 33:55.329
- THAT'S AWESOME.

33:55.370 --> 33:56.678
- YEAH.

33:56.720 --> 33:57.539
- SO IMPORTANT
TO NIP THESE THINGS IN THE BUD.

33:57.580 --> 33:59.059
- IT IS. YEAH.

33:59.100 --> 34:00.783
- SO YOU'RE GONNA BE BILLING
FOR THE EXTRA HOURS?

34:00.830 --> 34:04.448
- UH, WE AGREED TO,
YOU KNOW,

34:04.490 --> 34:05.616
PUT THE TIME IN NOW
FOR THE LONG HAUL.

34:05.660 --> 34:08.208
- FOR THE LONG HAUL? IS THAT
WHAT SHE'S SAYING TO YOU?

34:08.250 --> 34:10.104
- THAT'S WHAT WE AGREED TO.
- THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID TO YOU.

34:10.150 --> 34:12.527
- THAT'S WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT.

34:12.560 --> 34:13.356
SHE AND I, MY BUSINESS PARTNER.
- BUT SHE SAID THAT BECAUSE

34:13.390 --> 34:15.494
SHE'S NOT THE ONE
PAYING YOUR GUYS.

34:15.530 --> 34:16.758
- SHE'S NOT. SHE'S THE ONE
EMPLOYING ALL OF US.

34:16.810 --> 34:18.528
- SHE'S NOT THE ONE
TAKING THE HIT ON THIS.

34:18.570 --> 34:20.117
SHE IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF YOU.
- SHE'S TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ME.

34:20.160 --> 34:22.469
- YES.

34:22.500 --> 34:23.319
- DO YOU REALIZE HOW BIG
AN OPPORTUNITY THIS IS FOR ME?

34:23.370 --> 34:24.883
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

34:24.920 --> 34:25.909
- YEAH, BUT YOU'RE
SE'ITING A PRECEDENT HERE.

34:25.960 --> 34:27.609
AND I'M SAYING YOU LOST
PERSPECTIVE ON IT--

34:27.650 --> 34:28.605
- I'M SETTING A PRECEDENT
SO THAT I CAN CONTINUE

34:28.650 --> 34:30.470
WORKING WITH THIS WOMAN
FOR YEARS TO COME.

34:30.510 --> 34:32.614
- AND SHE'S GONNA RESPECT YOU
FOR STANDING YOUR GROUND.

34:32.650 --> 34:35.096
- STEP OFF!

34:39.730 --> 34:41.345
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

34:41.380 --> 34:43.519
THIS IS MY BUSINESS.

34:43.560 --> 34:46.768
THIS IS NOT YOU, THIS IS ME.

35:02.300 --> 35:04.120
- HEY.
- HEY, CAN WE TALK?

35:04.170 --> 35:05.125
- COME WITH ME.
I NEED YOUR HELP.

35:05.170 --> 35:06.194
- ALL RIGHT.

35:06.240 --> 35:08.333
- HEY.
- SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

35:08.380 --> 35:10.928
- GUYS, COULD YOU COME
OVER HERE FOR A SECOND?

35:10.970 --> 35:13.279
- WHAT ARE WE DOING?
- LISTEN TO ME.

35:13.310 --> 35:15.483
RIGHT HERE. MEET THE BEATLES.
YOU SEE THIS?

35:15.520 --> 35:20.389
NIRVANA, BLEACH.
NEBRASKA,SPRINGSTEEN, ELVIS.

35:20.420 --> 35:23.526
ALL THESE WERE BREAKOUT ALBUMS
RECORDED ON A SHOESTRING BUDGET.

35:24.910 --> 35:28.801
THE TITLE TRACK ON THIS ONE.
$4. RECORDED FOR $4.

35:28.850 --> 35:32.365
BLEACH--
THE WHOLE ALBUM, 600 BUCKS.

35:32.400 --> 35:33.560
SPRINGSTEEN MADE NEBRASKA
ON A FOUR-TRACK IN HIS BEDROOM.

35:33.610 --> 35:36.363
- IS THAT RIGHT?
- YEAH.

35:36.410 --> 35:38.196
THESE ALBUMS
DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

35:38.230 --> 35:40.505
THEY WERE ALL
STRIPPED-DOWN AND RAW.

35:40.550 --> 35:42.472
THEY WEREN'T HIDING BEHIND
ANY FANCY PRODUCTION.

35:42.510 --> 35:43.852
THEY HAD SOMETHING TO SAY,

35:43.900 --> 35:46.539
THEY SAID IT,
AND PEOPLE LISTENED.

35:46.590 --> 35:48.376
SO HERE'S WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO.

35:48.420 --> 35:49.648
WE'RE GETTING RID
OF THE LUTE,

35:49.690 --> 35:51.555
WE'RE GETTING RID
OF THE SAMPLES,

35:51.590 --> 35:53.171
AND ALL THE LAYERS,
AND WE'RE GONNA RECORD YOU GUYS

35:53.220 --> 35:55.620
DOWN AND DIRTY
BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE GOODS.

35:55.670 --> 35:57.900
YOU'RE ACTUALLY A GREAT BAND.
YOU HAVE GREAT SONGS.

35:57.940 --> 36:00.807
OLIVER, AS ANNOYING
AS YOU ARE,

36:00.840 --> 36:01.807
YOU CAN SING, MAN.

36:01.840 --> 36:04.559
SO JUST SING.

36:04.610 --> 36:09.229
AND LEAVE THE REST TO US.

36:09.270 --> 36:12.433
- OKAY. COOL.

36:12.480 --> 36:16.689
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

36:16.720 --> 36:19.371
- OKAY.

36:19.410 --> 36:20.650
- OKAY.

36:26.830 --> 36:27.865
- HEY.
- HELLO.

36:27.900 --> 36:32.007
HOW'D IT GO, MY MAN?
- GOOD.

36:32.050 --> 36:33.768
CAN WE JUST STAY
A LITTLE LONGER?

36:33.810 --> 36:35.357
I'M NOT FINISHED
CLEANING THE PARTS.

36:35.400 --> 36:37.846
- YEAH, WE'RE NOT QUITE
FINISHED DOING...

36:40.610 --> 36:43.841
UH, TELL YOU WHAT, VICTOR, WHY
DON'T YOU GO WASH YOUR HANDS,

36:43.890 --> 36:47.360
AND WE'LL TACKLE THIS
ANOTHER TIME. ALL RIGHT?

36:47.410 --> 36:48.297
- OKAY.
- THANKS. GREAT JOB.

36:48.340 --> 36:51.264
- THANK YOU.

36:51.310 --> 36:52.402
- MAN, I AM TELLING YOU,

36:52.450 --> 36:54.338
THIS WHOLE CAR IDEA--

36:54.380 --> 36:55.130
I MEAN, I SHOULD
HAVE FIVE OF THESE.

36:55.170 --> 37:00.278
- IT--[chuckles] YEAH.
- YEAH.

37:00.320 --> 37:01.582
- HOW DOES MOM LIKE IT?

37:01.630 --> 37:03.723
- YOUR MO--
SHE LOVES IT. WHY?

37:03.770 --> 37:07.490
- WELL...

37:07.530 --> 37:09.634
SHE TOLD ME ABOUT THE HOUSE.

37:09.670 --> 37:12.355
ABOUT THAT CONDO
SHE WANTED YOU TO SEE,

37:12.400 --> 37:13.799
WOULDN'T EVEN TALK TO HER
ABOUT IT, SHE SAID.

37:17.300 --> 37:20.269
- HUH. WELL, UH...

37:20.300 --> 37:23.269
I GO'ITA TELL YA, THAT'S
BETWEEN YOUR MOTHER AND I,

37:23.310 --> 37:24.925
AND I APPRECIATE
YOUR ASKING, SWEETHEART,

37:24.960 --> 37:27.952
BUT REALLY,
YOU'RE KIND OF INTRUDING.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.729
- SHE HAS A RIGHT
TO TALK TO YOU

37:31.760 --> 37:34.479
ABOUT WHATEVER SHE WANTS
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

37:34.520 --> 37:37.796
SHE HAS A VOICE IN THIS,
YOU KNOW?

37:37.840 --> 37:40.070
LOOK, I AM SO GRATEFUL
FOR THIS CAR,

37:40.110 --> 37:42.624
THIS HAS BEEN
SO GOOD FOR VICTOR,

37:42.670 --> 37:46.390
BUT YOU HAVE TO TALK TO MOM.
AND YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO HER.

37:46.430 --> 37:49.558
BECAUSE SHE'S YOUR WIFE
AND BECAUSE

37:49.610 --> 37:50.747
SHE HAS A RIGHT
TO WEIGH IN ON--

37:50.780 --> 37:53.362
ON DECISIONS THAT AFFECT
BOTH OF YOUR LIVES, YOU KNOW?

37:53.400 --> 37:55.402
- OKAY. YOU OKAY HERE?

37:55.440 --> 37:58.329
- IT'S--I'M FINE.

37:58.370 --> 37:59.997
SORRY.

38:00.030 --> 38:02.999
I JUST HAD TO SAY SOMETHING.
- [chuckles]

38:08.630 --> 38:10.006
- CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SEC?

38:10.040 --> 38:12.838
- HMM.

38:15.940 --> 38:19.398
- SO, UM, I TALKED
TO YOUR YEARBOOK ADVISOR

38:19.430 --> 38:21.978
AND YOUR PRINCIPAL,

38:22.020 --> 38:26.912
AND THEY HAVE DECIDED TO MOVE
YOU TO LAYOUT ON THE YEARBOOK.

38:26.950 --> 38:28.360
- I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO
BOTH THE LAYOUT

38:28.400 --> 38:30.402
AND TAKE THE PICTURES
AT THE SAME TIME.

38:30.440 --> 38:32.089
I DON'T KNOW--I DON'T THINK
I'LL HAVE TIME TO DO THAT

38:32.130 --> 38:33.028
'CAUSE I ALREADY HAVE HANK
AND I'M DOING MATH WARRIORS

38:33.060 --> 38:34.994
THREE TIMES A WEEK.
- RIGHT.

38:35.030 --> 38:39.797
WELL, YOU WON'T BE
TAKING PICTURES ANYMORE.

38:39.830 --> 38:40.615
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

38:40.660 --> 38:42.104
- THEY JUST WANT YOU
TO DO LAYOUT

38:42.140 --> 38:44.028
AND LEARN PHOTOSHOP.

38:44.080 --> 38:45.729
- NO, NO, BUT I'M
THE BEST PHOTOGRAPHER.

38:45.770 --> 38:47.419
- YOU ARE.
YOU ARE THE BEST PHOTOGRAPHER.

38:47.460 --> 38:49.007
BUT THERE ARE OTHER KIDS
AT THE SCHOOL AND THEY HAVE TO--

38:49.050 --> 38:51.871
- NO, THAT'S TOTALLY UNJUST.

38:51.910 --> 38:53.593
I MEAN, WHY WOULDN'T
THE BEST PHOTOGRAPHER

38:53.640 --> 38:54.902
BE ALLOWED TO TAKE PICTURES?

38:54.950 --> 38:56.633
- YOU'LL STILL BE ABLE
TO TAKE PICTURES, OKAY?

38:56.670 --> 38:57.989
YOU'LL STILL BE ABLE
TO WORK WITH HANK.

38:58.020 --> 38:59.772
- HANK DOESN'T
HAVE A YEARBOOK.

38:59.820 --> 39:01.811
- I KNOW HE DOESN'T, BUT THIS
IS WHAT THE SCHOOL HAS DECIDED.

39:01.850 --> 39:02.771
THEY THINK THAT'S BEST.

39:02.820 --> 39:04.674
- NO, BUT IT'S STUPID
AND IT'S NOT FAIR.

39:04.720 --> 39:08.884
MOM, ANSWER ME.
DO YOU THINK THAT IT'S FAIR?

39:08.930 --> 39:10.682
- NO, I DON'T THINK
THAT IT'S FAIR.

39:10.720 --> 39:12.062
- RIGHT, YOU DON'T THINK THAT--
NO YOU DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR,

39:12.100 --> 39:14.728
THEN WHY SHOULD WE LISTEN T--
- LISTEN TO ME,

39:14.760 --> 39:15.829
THIS IS WHAT THEY'VE DECIDED.

39:15.870 --> 39:18.179
SOMETIMES IN LIFE...
- IT'S NOT FAIR.

39:18.210 --> 39:19.939
- THINGS AREN'T FAIR, OKAY?

39:19.970 --> 39:20.959
AND AS YOU GET OLDER
YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT.

39:21.010 --> 39:24.423
OKAY, I THINK THAT THIS--
THIS SUCKS FOR YOU.

39:24.460 --> 39:26.564
I THINK IT'S AWFUL,
BUT WE CAN'T CHANGE EVERYTHING.

39:26.600 --> 39:28.010
WE HAVE TO ABIDE BY
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.

39:28.050 --> 39:32.737
- NO, IT'S STUPID.
WHY SHOULD IT BE LIKE THIS?

39:32.780 --> 39:37.808
I'M REALLY MAD ABOUT THIS.

39:37.850 --> 39:40.023
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M REALLY MAD ABOUT THIS TOO.

39:40.060 --> 39:43.712
I'M SO MAD ABOUT THIS.

39:43.760 --> 39:48.652
SO WE'RE JUST GONNA SIT HERE
AND WE'RE GONNA BE MAD TOGETHER.

39:48.690 --> 39:53.036
WE'RE JUST GONNA SIT HERE
AND BE MAD TOGETHER.

40:01.570 --> 40:04.664
[sighs]

40:04.710 --> 40:08.771
- CAN'T REMEMBER
WHEN WE LAST

40:10.260 --> 40:15.129
TOOK THE TIME
TO SEE THE SUNSET

40:15.170 --> 40:16.159
- MRS. BRAVERMAN.

40:16.200 --> 40:19.021
- RYAN.
- YEAH.

40:19.070 --> 40:20.583
- HI. COME ON IN.

40:20.620 --> 40:23.544
- UH, YOU HAVE JUST A SEC?
- OF COURSE. COME ON IN.

40:23.590 --> 40:24.796
- NO, I'M OKAY.

40:24.830 --> 40:28.209
UM...

40:28.250 --> 40:30.036
MY DAD DIED WHEN I WAS 11

40:30.080 --> 40:32.833
AND MY MOM REMARRIED

40:32.870 --> 40:37.898
HALF A YEAR LATER
TO A GUY FROM WORK

40:37.950 --> 40:41.602
WHO WAS OKAY TO HER,
BUT THOUGHT CORPORAL PUNISHMENT

40:41.640 --> 40:44.529
WAS THE BEST WAY
TO HANDLE A WILD KID

40:44.580 --> 40:45.569
WHO WAS PISSED AS HELL
ABOUT LOSING HIS DAD.

40:45.610 --> 40:48.716
- OH, RYAN, I'M SO SORRY.

40:48.750 --> 40:50.889
- NO, NO, NO.
I DON'T NEED PITY, I'M JUST--

40:50.930 --> 40:54.024
I'M JUST--I'M JUST
TELLING YOU THE REASON

40:54.070 --> 40:55.207
WHY I LEI-T HOME
AS QUICK AS I DID

40:55.240 --> 40:56.821
AND NEVER LOOKED BACK,
NEVER WILL.

40:56.860 --> 40:58.202
- RYAN, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
GIVE ME AN EXPLANATION.

40:58.240 --> 41:00.583
- WELL, I WANT
TO GIVE YOU THE ANSWERS

41:00.630 --> 41:03.178
TO THE QUESTIONS
YOU KEEP ASKING, SO...

41:03.210 --> 41:06.099
NOT EVERYBODY
HAS A FAMILY LIKE YOURS.

41:06.150 --> 41:09.495
AND I KNOW THAT I MESSED UP.

41:09.530 --> 41:10.758
I KNOW THAT I DID SOME THINGS
THE LAST TIME I GOT BACK

41:10.810 --> 41:12.254
THAT SCARED YOU
AND THEY SHOULD HAVE.

41:12.290 --> 41:13.564
IT'S YOUR DAUGHTER.

41:13.600 --> 41:16.160
BUT I LOVE HER.

41:16.190 --> 41:19.671
I LOVE HER SO MUCH.

41:19.710 --> 41:23.669
AND I'M WORKING SO HARD
TO GET BETTER.

41:23.720 --> 41:25.506
AND I WANT TO BE WORTHY
OF YOUR FAMILY.

41:25.550 --> 41:27.689
I WANT TO BE WORTHY OF HER.

41:27.720 --> 41:29.267
AND I KNOW YOU THINK
THAT WE'RE RUSHING,

41:29.310 --> 41:32.962
WE'RE GOING
INTO THIS TOO FAST,

41:33.000 --> 41:35.036
BUT I CAN TELL YOU GREW UP
REAL FAST ON YOUR OWN.

41:35.070 --> 41:36.276
YOU GREW UP FAST
IN THE MILITARY.

41:36.320 --> 41:39.244
I KNOW WHAT I WANT.

41:39.280 --> 41:44.070
AND I WANT US TO START
OUR LIVES TOGETHER.

41:47.120 --> 41:50.840
- NICE SURPRISE
READY TO GROW...

41:50.880 --> 41:52.916
- OKAY.

41:52.950 --> 41:54.292
- THANKS.

41:54.330 --> 41:55.262
- AI-TER ALL
IS SAID AND DONE

41:55.300 --> 42:00.021
AI-TER ALL IS SAID AND DONE
- OKAY.

42:00.060 --> 42:02.620
OH, AND SARAH...

42:02.650 --> 42:03.639
IT'S FIXED.

42:03.690 --> 42:04.850
- THANKS.

42:04.900 --> 42:07.585
- THE TOILET.

42:07.620 --> 42:10.248
- AI-TER ALL IS SAID AND DONE
- OKAY.
