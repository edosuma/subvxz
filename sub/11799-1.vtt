00:54.290 --> 00:56.043
Okay! Okay!

00:56.170 --> 00:57.524
Okay!

01:00.330 --> 01:01.759
What?

01:04.290 --> 01:05.724
Okay.

01:16.250 --> 01:17.570
Okay.

01:17.690 --> 01:19.106
Okay.

02:10.650 --> 02:12.448
I'm sorry!

02:43.010 --> 02:45.081
Okay, okay.

02:47.890 --> 02:48.880
Okay.

02:49.930 --> 02:50.886
Okay.

03:03.970 --> 03:05.165
Okay.

03:06.590 --> 03:07.809
Okay.

05:36.330 --> 05:38.402
Grab me! Yeah!

05:43.250 --> 05:45.481
Uh! Kiss me.

05:57.010 --> 05:59.286
Grab me! Uh!

06:01.650 --> 06:03.721
Grab them. Come on.

06:06.930 --> 06:08.410
Kiss me.

07:05.610 --> 07:06.930
Hi.

07:08.050 --> 07:09.201
I'm Robyn.

07:15.330 --> 07:16.320
Hi.

07:16.450 --> 07:17.520
Hi.

07:18.770 --> 07:19.806
Seb.

07:21.690 --> 07:23.921
Sorry, this is, er...

07:24.050 --> 07:25.006
Livvy.

07:25.130 --> 07:28.282
- Livvy!
- I told you it's Livvy!

07:28.410 --> 07:29.400
Hi.

07:29.530 --> 07:30.964
Hi.

07:33.010 --> 07:34.205
I'm Patricia.

07:39.930 --> 07:41.444
You okay?

07:44.230 --> 07:47.880
I guess we've just had a bit
of time to get used to it.

07:49.310 --> 07:52.402
Oh, Christ! She's at it again.

08:02.050 --> 08:03.689
Hey!

08:11.530 --> 08:12.964
Of course.

08:14.370 --> 08:15.804
No blood.

08:20.730 --> 08:22.642
How's the nutcase?

08:22.770 --> 08:24.887
She killed herself yet?

08:26.250 --> 08:28.526
You know that doesn't work here, right?

08:28.650 --> 08:29.879
Pat, was it?

08:31.010 --> 08:33.081
Patricia.

08:33.210 --> 08:35.929
Will you do us a favour, Pat?
Will you fuck off?

08:40.809 --> 08:42.767
Is she still there?

08:42.890 --> 08:45.530
She keeps doing that "foomph" thing.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.243
That...

08:47.370 --> 08:49.362
- What?
- You'll see.

08:57.570 --> 09:01.530
Right, come on. You're not
the only one who's freaked out.

09:02.770 --> 09:06.684
You're going to help me figure this out.
What's your name?

09:06.810 --> 09:08.130
Onie.

09:09.690 --> 09:11.443
It's Onie.

09:11.570 --> 09:12.924
Onie?

09:19.370 --> 09:22.647
Do any of you know where we are?

09:24.970 --> 09:26.768
- We're dead.
- We're dead. Yeah.

09:26.890 --> 09:28.847
We're all dead.

09:30.930 --> 09:35.607
And realising that, you just thought,
"Threesome!"?

09:42.090 --> 09:44.446
Do you remember how you got here?

09:48.370 --> 09:51.488
We were in JJ's. It was a great night.

09:51.610 --> 09:55.240
Tunes were banging. Place was heaving.

09:56.650 --> 09:59.688
But then it started to get fuller and fuller.

10:01.570 --> 10:04.085
People started to get crushed.

10:04.210 --> 10:05.803
And then the noise.

10:07.090 --> 10:09.047
Like thunder.

10:09.170 --> 10:11.969
I thought it was the bass at first, until...

10:12.090 --> 10:14.525
it all started coming down.

10:16.170 --> 10:18.446
Panic, screaming.

10:19.730 --> 10:21.323
Blackness.

10:36.170 --> 10:39.447
And, er, next thing I know, I'm soaked.

10:39.570 --> 10:40.890
Freezing.

10:42.930 --> 10:45.729
Hanging on to the cooler
I'd nicked from the VIPs.

10:49.050 --> 10:51.429
And then there's the girls.

10:51.550 --> 10:54.802
Freezing, just like me.

10:54.930 --> 10:56.887
Washed up.

11:00.450 --> 11:02.885
But there was no sign of my mate Sean.

11:03.930 --> 11:07.082
He'd rubbed the stamp off his hand
and been kicked out.

11:10.010 --> 11:12.366
No fucking nightclub collapsed on him.

11:15.690 --> 11:19.047
We climbed the bank.
And that's when we saw this place.

11:23.210 --> 11:25.441
But it makes you wonder...

11:27.170 --> 11:28.923
...what the fuck did we do...

11:30.690 --> 11:32.329
to deserve this?

11:33.370 --> 11:35.760
What does it mean?

11:35.890 --> 11:37.449
"Clean slate".

11:38.770 --> 11:40.329
It's Latin.

11:44.810 --> 11:46.802
You wake up dead.

11:48.210 --> 11:50.281
That's about as bad as things go, right?

11:51.690 --> 11:54.922
But then there's booze and there's girls.

11:56.730 --> 11:58.722
And what about the smoke?

12:00.250 --> 12:01.206
Hmm?

12:01.330 --> 12:03.845
What smoke?

12:03.970 --> 12:06.485
The thing that was...

12:06.610 --> 12:10.570
It was on the beach.
It made a noise. It was...

12:11.810 --> 12:14.041
It was in here when you three were...

12:14.170 --> 12:15.843
When you were...

12:15.970 --> 12:17.404
Fucking.

14:04.170 --> 14:06.361
She keeps doing it.

14:06.490 --> 14:08.641
She goes, she comes back.

14:08.770 --> 14:10.921
Always right where she was.

14:13.330 --> 14:15.128
How often?

14:15.250 --> 14:17.003
For how long?

14:17.130 --> 14:19.167
It's never the same.

14:20.290 --> 14:23.522
No, towards me a bit. Yeah! That's it.

14:23.650 --> 14:26.119
Got to make your own fun though, don't you?

14:31.490 --> 14:34.324
So did you guys all know each other,
before the club?

14:36.330 --> 14:39.562
I don't mean anything by this. Rob, is it?

14:39.690 --> 14:41.647
Robyn.

14:41.770 --> 14:45.764
Yeah, this whole interrogation thing.
It's getting kind of tired.

14:45.890 --> 14:48.485
So what should I be doing?
Humping the first dead guy I meet?

14:48.610 --> 14:51.444
- Ex-fucking-cuse me?
- Look...

14:51.570 --> 14:54.005
I don't mean to interrupt
whatever it was you were doing.

14:54.130 --> 14:57.840
I mean, if you're enjoying it, that's fine.
I want to get home.

14:57.970 --> 15:00.724
Do you think we can... go home?

15:00.850 --> 15:05.879
Well, Livvy, if we all pull together
and work as a team, then...

15:06.010 --> 15:07.729
Christ! You're in management, aren't you?

15:13.650 --> 15:16.563
Are you a regular at JJ's?

15:17.610 --> 15:19.169
Have we met?

15:19.290 --> 15:21.566
I think I've seen you there.

15:21.690 --> 15:24.444
Why did they keep letting people in?

15:24.570 --> 15:25.765
Money.

15:27.210 --> 15:29.770
The evil of money, ladies, always is.

15:30.890 --> 15:33.121
Welcome to hell.

15:33.250 --> 15:34.843
This isn't hell.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.365
Do you think they hang paintings
like that in heaven?

16:08.290 --> 16:11.010
Oh... come on!

16:12.970 --> 16:14.848
Well, that's why.

16:14.970 --> 16:17.166
Hell is other people.

16:17.290 --> 16:18.485
No.

16:19.890 --> 16:22.280
The reason it's hell

16:22.410 --> 16:23.969
is because of this...

17:20.730 --> 17:23.086
What do you think?

17:23.210 --> 17:24.530
Hell?

17:26.450 --> 17:28.806
You still not sure?

17:33.170 --> 17:35.446
I'm not going out there.

17:35.570 --> 17:37.846
Because it's so warm and cosy in here?

17:37.970 --> 17:39.324
It was.

17:40.370 --> 17:41.520
Anyway...

17:41.650 --> 17:44.119
you don't know what's out there.

17:44.250 --> 17:46.765
Look, I'm going home.

17:46.890 --> 17:49.962
- I don't think we can.
- But you don't know that.

17:51.010 --> 17:52.967
Let's find out.

17:53.090 --> 17:54.570
Ridiculous.

17:54.690 --> 17:56.761
Where is it she goes when she disappears?

17:56.890 --> 17:59.200
- Who really cares?
- You think she's going back?

17:59.330 --> 18:00.525
Yes!

18:00.650 --> 18:04.360
Onie, I think you're still alive somewhere.

18:04.490 --> 18:07.050
In the rubble or in a hospital by now.

18:07.170 --> 18:10.800
- Maybe time isn't the same here?
- You just want to believe that.

18:12.370 --> 18:16.205
Have you even looked anywhere else?
Maybe there are others like us. Seb?

18:19.610 --> 18:22.330
No. I'm fine, thanks.

18:24.330 --> 18:27.641
You know, my dad always says

18:27.770 --> 18:31.923
that people who demand to be listened to
really have nothing to say.

18:36.570 --> 18:37.890
Fine.

18:39.010 --> 18:40.603
Come on.

19:31.090 --> 19:34.447
Is it me or is that lighthouse
not getting any closer?

19:36.850 --> 19:38.842
Are you keeping up?

19:43.930 --> 19:45.080
Fuck!

20:10.930 --> 20:12.728
What was that?

20:12.850 --> 20:14.682
Don't stop!

20:22.370 --> 20:24.566
You can't just keep going.

20:24.690 --> 20:27.569
- Onie can find her own way back.
- She'll come back.

20:27.690 --> 20:29.409
She always comes back.

20:29.530 --> 20:33.809
Livvy, you do hear that, right?
Do you really want to stay here?

20:34.850 --> 20:37.445
No, we wait for her!

21:02.290 --> 21:03.644
Take it.

21:03.770 --> 21:05.523
Take it!

21:05.650 --> 21:06.640
Bitch!

21:17.310 --> 21:19.205
Go on!

21:39.650 --> 21:41.528
I can't see the house.

21:50.770 --> 21:51.886
Livvy.

22:09.450 --> 22:11.601
- What's...
- Come on!

22:17.810 --> 22:18.800
Come on!

22:36.370 --> 22:37.565
Robyn...

22:38.850 --> 22:41.968
- Oh, you have to be joking!
- What?

22:43.690 --> 22:45.647
That's not possible.

22:47.250 --> 22:48.650
We're back.

23:05.930 --> 23:07.842
Seb? Tricia?

24:42.890 --> 24:44.847
Fuck's sake!

25:18.490 --> 25:19.606
Seb.

25:20.730 --> 25:22.164
Be careful.

25:48.490 --> 25:49.321
Boo!

25:55.650 --> 25:58.609
Do that again. I fucking dare you.

26:17.090 --> 26:20.083
- You walked in a circle.
- No.

26:20.210 --> 26:22.770
We were always going
towards the lighthouse.

26:22.890 --> 26:26.201
You must have walked in a circle. You know,
my dad always says the simplest thing...

26:26.330 --> 26:28.367
Put it to sleep, Pat, will you?

26:29.810 --> 26:33.247
All right. So come on, you two,
what the fuck happened?

26:36.330 --> 26:38.686
Something was in there with us.

26:42.330 --> 26:43.969
It took over.

26:57.890 --> 27:00.325
You know, this is my flat.

27:00.450 --> 27:04.205
This room. The table, the sofas, the kitchen.

27:05.810 --> 27:09.565
It's the exact same place I shared when
I was a student. The same shitty furniture.

27:09.690 --> 27:11.921
But not the cooler?

27:13.370 --> 27:14.963
No.

27:15.090 --> 27:18.003
That's mental.
That's, like, I brought it with me.

27:18.130 --> 27:19.883
Nice place!

27:21.170 --> 27:23.969
The bedroom. This bedroom.

27:24.090 --> 27:26.400
This was my mum and dad's bedroom.

27:27.850 --> 27:32.879
Me and my sister's first bedroom,
before we moved to England.

27:34.170 --> 27:37.402
So this is all built from places we know?

27:40.370 --> 27:44.523
The bathroom's mine.
It's from the community centre.

27:44.650 --> 27:46.289
My church group.

27:49.410 --> 27:51.606
Bible thumper?

27:52.850 --> 27:54.443
You?

27:54.570 --> 27:57.881
No wonder you're pissed off,
winding up here.

27:58.010 --> 28:01.481
Look around. Does this feel
like a Christian thing to you?

28:01.610 --> 28:03.806
Well, you're the expert.

28:05.370 --> 28:07.487
What's your bit?

28:10.930 --> 28:13.650
This is. The house.

28:13.770 --> 28:15.443
The outside.

28:18.170 --> 28:20.321
And the lighthouse.

28:22.250 --> 28:24.924
Mum used to take me to Devon every year.

28:25.050 --> 28:26.928
She had a...

28:27.050 --> 28:29.246
friend who'd let us use it.

28:31.650 --> 28:33.881
I remember it bigger.

28:34.970 --> 28:37.166
But then you always do, I suppose.

28:41.850 --> 28:44.445
Every year, she'd draw a face on the window.

28:44.570 --> 28:47.165
I'd have to work out who it was.

28:48.490 --> 28:50.846
And then one year she drew this.

28:52.770 --> 28:55.922
Of course, it didn't look like anyone,
so I gave up.

28:58.010 --> 29:00.889
It was her way of telling me
she was pregnant.

29:02.530 --> 29:05.090
It was just the outline of a face.

29:05.210 --> 29:06.963
Unfinished.

29:12.490 --> 29:15.085
We should find something to nail over that.

29:58.410 --> 30:00.208
I want my mum.

30:01.330 --> 30:02.446
Huh?

30:02.570 --> 30:05.449
Still live at home, just me and her.

30:07.730 --> 30:10.404
She's brilliant on birthdays, my mum!

30:10.530 --> 30:14.524
She's got great taste.
Always gets me vouchers.

30:22.050 --> 30:25.521
I always wanted to be a good mum one day.

30:35.770 --> 30:37.887
No hammer. No nails.

30:38.010 --> 30:42.289
And I seriously doubt a tea tray and
some forks is going to stop this thing.

30:59.290 --> 31:02.920
Fucking hell-art, man! This wasn't ours.

31:03.050 --> 31:05.167
We had a Predator poster up there.

31:05.290 --> 31:08.362
And then some bird with
her knickers pulled aside...

31:08.490 --> 31:10.607
shaved.

31:19.010 --> 31:20.842
You are here.

31:22.690 --> 31:25.285
Other beaches, other houses.

31:25.410 --> 31:27.561
It's not just us.

31:27.690 --> 31:29.921
I don't think so.

31:31.210 --> 31:32.690
This house.

31:32.810 --> 31:35.530
It's made for us, specifically.

31:35.650 --> 31:37.767
Let's try something.

31:37.890 --> 31:41.167
- What did we do to deserve this?
- Are you kidding?

31:41.290 --> 31:44.522
If we're being punished,
then somebody thinks we did something.

31:44.650 --> 31:47.245
Maybe we should work out what that is.

31:47.370 --> 31:50.681
Oh, yeah! Truth or dare.

31:53.890 --> 31:55.847
I'm not fucking doing that!

31:57.770 --> 31:59.887
What have you got to lose?

32:02.930 --> 32:05.570
There's only one way to play this game.

32:22.850 --> 32:25.809
Right. Shall I start then?

32:25.930 --> 32:29.162
Millions of parking tickets.
I always pay them.

32:29.290 --> 32:33.045
Every week, he'd turn his back and we'd
take what we could from the pick 'n' mix.

32:34.090 --> 32:36.161
It's a strict house to grow up in.

32:36.290 --> 32:38.566
Are there calories in this?

32:49.410 --> 32:52.244
Always second helpings.
Thirds if I could get them.

32:53.690 --> 32:55.841
Gluttony's one of the big seven.

32:58.330 --> 33:01.767
He could afford it and I needed a new phone.

33:01.890 --> 33:04.689
You can't move and
not break a rule or it's,

33:04.810 --> 33:08.724
"Oh, Onie, we're just
disappointed in you... again."

33:08.850 --> 33:11.410
Sometimes I'll have to push
through a contract early.

33:11.530 --> 33:13.487
Fudge the date.

33:13.610 --> 33:16.728
Whoa, steady on there!
Cheating the paperwork?

33:18.210 --> 33:20.486
- Yep.
- Used an old student's paper

33:20.610 --> 33:22.647
to pass my coursework.

33:27.370 --> 33:30.442
Lustful thoughts, thousands and thousands.

33:30.570 --> 33:32.562
I second that.

33:32.690 --> 33:34.283
Me too.

33:34.410 --> 33:36.322
One night stands.

33:36.450 --> 33:41.047
She had tits like this! Out there, whoa!
I mean, you couldn't not have a go.

33:42.970 --> 33:45.530
Sometimes when I read a book, I...

33:47.930 --> 33:51.162
Slept with someone else's husband,
but I didn't know he was married.

33:51.290 --> 33:55.728
Didn't wear a condom. Crushed up
her morning-after pill. Put it in her coffee.

33:55.850 --> 33:57.489
Boof!

34:08.730 --> 34:09.607
Fucker!

34:18.489 --> 34:21.801
Oh, this is pointless!
I don't even feel like I'm getting pissed.

34:21.929 --> 34:25.480
How can you get pissed
if you don't have a pulse?

34:25.610 --> 34:28.286
How can Seb get a stiffy?

34:33.690 --> 34:34.918
Seb.

34:36.170 --> 34:37.524
Robyn.

34:37.650 --> 34:39.687
You've missed quite a big one.

34:39.810 --> 34:41.688
And what's that?

34:42.889 --> 34:46.440
They interviewed me. As a witness.

34:48.850 --> 34:50.204
As a witness?

35:01.250 --> 35:03.640
I... I was accused.

35:03.770 --> 35:06.285
Accused, mind you...

35:07.330 --> 35:09.720
...of some... assault.

35:11.570 --> 35:13.163
A rape.

35:15.090 --> 35:17.321
What was it you were supposed
to have witnessed?

35:17.450 --> 35:18.486
I was...

35:19.810 --> 35:22.484
- I saw you leave the club with her.
- And?

35:22.610 --> 35:26.320
- She was in no fit state.
- Oh? You could tell by looking?

35:27.890 --> 35:29.688
She consented.

35:29.810 --> 35:31.369
Right?

35:31.490 --> 35:33.641
The way you know that is,

35:33.770 --> 35:36.001
is that I wasn't charged.

35:38.690 --> 35:41.285
Do you remember her name?

35:42.930 --> 35:44.159
No.

35:44.940 --> 35:46.594
Do you?

36:28.010 --> 36:29.444
Robyn.

36:31.010 --> 36:32.285
A word.

36:33.810 --> 36:35.287
Outside.

36:43.970 --> 36:47.327
- It's a sin, right? It is a big fucking sin.
- Yeah, that I didn't do!

36:48.570 --> 36:51.244
I gave her one, yeah. Two, as it goes.

36:51.370 --> 36:53.327
But she knew.

36:53.450 --> 36:56.124
She was awake, she was talking.
She wanted to.

36:56.250 --> 36:58.560
And you're sure?

36:58.690 --> 37:01.330
No, I'm confused about it.

37:01.450 --> 37:04.568
You know how it is... a guy knows.

37:04.690 --> 37:07.000
Gives you the look all night.

37:07.130 --> 37:09.565
She wants you to take her home.

37:09.690 --> 37:13.206
You don't get too drunk with a bloke
unless you want him to take you home.

37:17.210 --> 37:20.442
Look, I've played your little game.
Move the fuck on.

37:26.570 --> 37:28.289
What do you do?

37:29.490 --> 37:31.004
Student.

37:31.130 --> 37:34.885
- Pure mathematics.
- And strict parents, huh?

37:35.760 --> 37:36.989
Two.

37:37.740 --> 37:40.050
Pure mathematics!

37:44.570 --> 37:48.803
I had a friend who used to hurt herself
in school, just like you do.

37:50.170 --> 37:52.685
Her boyfriend said, he said...

37:52.810 --> 37:55.689
she never felt like she belonged anywhere.

37:55.810 --> 38:00.726
She didn't want to kill herself.
She just didn't want to be anywhere.

38:00.850 --> 38:03.001
Maybe if...

38:03.130 --> 38:07.010
now you're here, if you
decided you wanted to be...

38:07.130 --> 38:09.486
I don't know. Here.

38:13.850 --> 38:15.569
- Whatever you did to this girl...
- I didn't!

38:15.690 --> 38:18.569
Whatever it was, we're connected.

38:18.690 --> 38:21.888
- Maybe we're here because...
- Maybe we're here because of you.

38:22.010 --> 38:24.570
Who's to say you're so fucking clean?

38:25.730 --> 38:26.686
Mm?

38:28.570 --> 38:32.484
- Okay, we need to calm down.
- No, we don't need to do anything.

38:32.610 --> 38:34.841
And not because you say so.

38:34.970 --> 38:37.963
I've been through hell
because that slut grassed me up.

38:39.290 --> 38:41.646
- So say one more word about it...
- Come on, Seb!

38:41.770 --> 38:44.569
I'm fucking serious! One more word.

38:44.690 --> 38:46.409
Is there...

38:49.450 --> 38:50.770
Great!

38:50.890 --> 38:53.166
Choke me, bitch!

38:54.490 --> 38:57.483
Did you hear her?
"We should stay here. It's nice."

38:58.610 --> 39:00.249
You colossal prick.

39:00.370 --> 39:04.489
Wow! Judgmental.
This is what you get with God botherers.

39:04.610 --> 39:07.808
You lot created this place.
You fucking chanted it into existence.

39:07.930 --> 39:09.489
All right, Seb, stop, now!

39:09.610 --> 39:11.283
I did nothing.

39:11.410 --> 39:13.402
Okay? Ask her!

39:14.810 --> 39:19.601
And as for you, I'm fucking a Christian
in the afterlife. And you wanted it!

39:19.730 --> 39:23.007
But it didn't fucking work out
for you though, did it?

39:23.130 --> 39:28.000
No harp for you. You're stuck here,
screwing your last, just like the rest of us.

39:28.130 --> 39:30.201
A fuck buddy in the hell light.

39:30.330 --> 39:33.402
But I get it. I know why you're here now.

39:33.530 --> 39:36.728
It's to make my death fucking miserable.

39:39.530 --> 39:41.567
Hell is other bitches.

39:44.762 --> 39:46.225
Fuck!

39:47.711 --> 39:49.024
Don't!

39:54.530 --> 39:55.520
Fuck!

39:57.410 --> 39:59.481
- Hey, Seb, be careful.
- Oh, yeah?

39:59.610 --> 40:01.363
I'll beware of the scary faces.

40:01.490 --> 40:04.722
The light probably doesn't even hit you
out there. Did you ever think of that?

40:04.850 --> 40:06.887
Don't go too far!

40:07.010 --> 40:09.684
Go too far? We're in Pac-Man, remember?

40:09.810 --> 40:12.006
If you get to the edge,
you come right back around.

40:12.130 --> 40:15.089
Wagga! Wagga! Wagga! Wagga! Wagga!

40:26.370 --> 40:29.090
"I've done loads." "Who loves you? I do."

40:29.210 --> 40:32.442
"Oh, is this your fingers?
Slam down my fucking throat!"

40:40.210 --> 40:41.883
Fucking bitch!

41:07.210 --> 41:08.485
Robyn?

41:12.490 --> 41:14.402
Did he do it?

41:15.890 --> 41:18.086
Well, it never came to being charged, but...

41:18.210 --> 41:20.406
Yes, she was broken.

41:20.530 --> 41:22.408
He broke her.

41:22.530 --> 41:24.806
I knew it! He had the...

41:24.930 --> 41:27.889
- Rapey eyes.
- Exactly.

41:34.730 --> 41:37.040
Has anyone looked in the mirror?

41:38.570 --> 41:39.686
Yeah.

41:39.810 --> 41:41.130
This...

41:42.250 --> 41:44.446
This isn't what I look like.

41:45.930 --> 41:48.968
I mean, it's me, but it's... better.

41:50.250 --> 41:51.923
Idealised.

41:57.450 --> 42:00.204
Who doesn't love a mirror that lies, right?

42:02.650 --> 42:04.528
Do you like it?

42:04.650 --> 42:07.609
Yeah, it's just... weird.

42:07.730 --> 42:10.962
I have a really blobby nose.

42:12.170 --> 42:13.968
I prefer this.

42:15.010 --> 42:17.889
I just wish I'd got bigger...

42:40.530 --> 42:42.408
Onie's our way out.

42:43.450 --> 42:45.123
She has to be.

42:46.210 --> 42:49.442
Maybe you should stop
figuring stuff out for a bit?

42:49.570 --> 42:51.323
You're not helping anyone.

42:53.810 --> 42:55.767
I'll stop when I'm home.

43:06.650 --> 43:09.370
What about the blank slate?

43:09.490 --> 43:13.120
Do you think we were given one,
a fresh start, when we got here?

43:14.490 --> 43:16.129
I hope not.

43:16.250 --> 43:18.640
I just broke a guy's hand.

43:18.770 --> 43:21.410
It doesn't count. Probably.

43:23.250 --> 43:25.321
I wanted to hurt him.

43:26.370 --> 43:27.804
That counts.

43:44.730 --> 43:45.686
Seb!

43:48.610 --> 43:50.203
Fuck!

43:58.490 --> 44:00.959
Fucking stupid cock-teasing cunt!

44:01.090 --> 44:03.366
Shove it up her so hard!

44:06.050 --> 44:08.281
Stupid cock-teasing cunt!

44:08.410 --> 44:11.005
Fucking deserves to be here, yeah.

44:11.130 --> 44:13.645
Shove it up her so hard!

44:13.770 --> 44:16.330
Fucking throat... fucking throat!

44:16.450 --> 44:20.080
She had tits like this! Out there, whoa!

45:18.890 --> 45:20.165
What the...

45:32.450 --> 45:34.768
I gave her one, two as it goes.

45:34.890 --> 45:36.927
You couldn't not have a go!

45:59.050 --> 46:00.200
No!

46:12.210 --> 46:13.326
No!

46:30.490 --> 46:31.640
Onie!

46:34.690 --> 46:36.204
What's that?

46:38.650 --> 46:39.925
It's, er...

46:41.490 --> 46:43.243
It's my dad's.

46:52.730 --> 46:55.086
I think you're right.

46:55.210 --> 46:57.361
I think I...

46:57.490 --> 47:00.483
might be alive somewhere.

47:03.130 --> 47:06.123
Dad must have been holding my hand or...

47:07.650 --> 47:09.642
I don't know.

47:12.130 --> 47:14.326
And you brought that back with you,

47:14.450 --> 47:16.043
which means...

47:18.570 --> 47:21.165
The bracelet! You're hurting me! Aah!

47:43.970 --> 47:45.245
Robyn.

47:49.130 --> 47:52.328
If you brought this here, maybe...

47:55.170 --> 47:57.082
...maybe you could take us home?

48:03.290 --> 48:05.407
We've got a weapon.

48:05.530 --> 48:07.362
And a way out.

48:29.210 --> 48:32.601
I like your waiting-and-holding-hands plan.

48:32.730 --> 48:34.847
Best plan yet.

48:34.970 --> 48:37.326
Do you like it here?

48:37.450 --> 48:40.124
I'm just making the most of...

48:40.250 --> 48:41.400
Look...

48:41.530 --> 48:43.965
my dad told me about heaven, okay?

48:45.090 --> 48:47.207
Anyway, my aunt...

48:47.330 --> 48:48.810
she died.

48:48.930 --> 48:51.126
And I was nine.

48:51.250 --> 48:56.484
She was the best. She had all
these trips to the zoo and sneaky gifts.

48:57.570 --> 48:59.846
At her funeral,

48:59.970 --> 49:02.849
I asked my dad if she'd go to heaven...

49:04.250 --> 49:06.560
...and he laughed at me.

49:06.690 --> 49:10.730
"Don't be so stupid, Patty.
Your aunt was a monster.

49:10.850 --> 49:14.446
She made money stripping
bankrupt companies."

49:14.570 --> 49:17.449
Ten people at her funeral.

49:18.570 --> 49:21.404
"And the only people she cared
about was your mother and you."

49:23.570 --> 49:26.130
I started crying.

49:26.250 --> 49:30.722
You know, that's the point when
a dad's supposed to comfort his little girl.

49:32.930 --> 49:35.889
But she was so... so nice to me.

49:36.010 --> 49:39.640
Surely that meant something?
Surely they'd let her in?

49:41.210 --> 49:43.805
But the next day,
my dad showed me this book.

49:45.170 --> 49:46.968
The pictures.

49:50.410 --> 49:53.084
Only the pure get into heaven.

49:54.410 --> 49:56.083
I remember that.

49:56.210 --> 49:57.883
The pure.

49:59.610 --> 50:01.602
No one stained.

50:01.730 --> 50:03.369
No one tainted.

50:06.010 --> 50:08.570
No, but I... I just couldn't help
thinking, you know,

50:08.690 --> 50:11.888
"Maybe she could just sneak into heaven?"

50:14.530 --> 50:16.886
But he laughed at me again.

50:17.010 --> 50:20.128
He said no sinner gets
into the house of God.

50:20.250 --> 50:25.882
And if they ever did, the whole afterlife
would crumble and rot in an instant.

50:27.810 --> 50:30.041
He said the sinner's a cancer.

50:31.810 --> 50:34.200
He called it eternity insurance.

50:36.930 --> 50:39.764
"Your Aunt Nadine's burning, Patty.

50:41.410 --> 50:43.561
And that's all there is to it."

50:44.290 --> 50:46.524
Eternity insurance?

50:48.090 --> 50:50.685
A fail-safe? That's bullshit.

50:53.130 --> 50:55.406
Where is it? Where the fuck is it?

50:55.530 --> 50:58.204
It comes back here. Did you send it?

50:59.450 --> 51:00.884
Fucker!

51:01.010 --> 51:02.205
Seb.

51:02.330 --> 51:05.767
This is all down to you. It came
after me because of what you said.

51:06.890 --> 51:08.610
And what did she say?

51:10.130 --> 51:12.645
It was on the beach. It chased me.

51:12.770 --> 51:14.489
It pinned me down.

51:17.570 --> 51:19.687
It raped me.

51:24.210 --> 51:25.883
It's not funny!

51:26.010 --> 51:28.127
Wait. It raped you?

51:28.250 --> 51:30.162
You mean up the...

51:30.290 --> 51:31.406
Aah!

51:31.530 --> 51:35.240
It's because women want to talk about it.
You always have to talk about it!

51:35.370 --> 51:36.520
Bitch!

51:45.130 --> 51:46.962
What the fuck?

51:58.130 --> 52:00.206
Stop it! Stop it!

52:00.330 --> 52:02.128
Stop it, stop it.

52:04.450 --> 52:06.726
Shut up, shut up.

52:07.200 --> 52:09.237
Seb, calm the fuck down!

52:12.650 --> 52:15.643
You're not laughing. Isn't it fucking funny?

52:17.010 --> 52:18.763
- Hey!
- What if you said no

52:18.890 --> 52:20.404
and I fucked you, huh?

52:20.530 --> 52:22.494
Would that be funny?

52:23.490 --> 52:26.324
What about you, sweetheart?
You wanna go again?

52:26.950 --> 52:28.567
It listens to us!

52:28.690 --> 52:31.480
- It knows what we've done!
- Get off!

52:33.050 --> 52:35.167
I'm going to kill you.

52:35.290 --> 52:37.885
I'm going to fuck all of you

52:38.010 --> 52:40.161
and I will not be punished!

52:43.370 --> 52:44.690
Fine.

53:17.368 --> 53:19.103
Now!

53:50.810 --> 53:52.324
Bastard!

54:29.050 --> 54:30.404
Robyn!

54:30.530 --> 54:32.169
What's...

54:38.650 --> 54:40.482
This is us.

54:40.610 --> 54:42.363
This is all us.

54:43.410 --> 54:45.049
It's a cartoon.

54:45.170 --> 54:46.604
A flick-book.

54:47.930 --> 54:51.048
This is what's happening
to the space around us.

54:51.170 --> 54:53.401
The bubble's shrinking.

54:54.650 --> 54:56.960
The house is in the centre of it.

54:57.090 --> 55:00.401
You reach the edge and
come back round but now...

55:00.530 --> 55:02.806
the edge is just outside these walls.

55:02.930 --> 55:04.444
Time's running out.

55:04.570 --> 55:07.324
Well, what happens when the bubble's gone?

55:07.450 --> 55:11.046
Those things, pressing
on the edge of the bubble.

55:13.810 --> 55:15.403
People.

55:15.530 --> 55:17.840
That's going to be us.

55:31.930 --> 55:33.523
Where is he?

55:33.650 --> 55:35.243
The bathroom.

55:35.370 --> 55:37.089
Oh, Onie.

55:39.050 --> 55:41.087
What is it, Robyn?

55:43.050 --> 55:44.450
What?

55:44.570 --> 55:48.007
I was holding on to you and Seb.

55:48.130 --> 55:51.328
But when I went... you stayed.

55:52.890 --> 55:55.041
I'm sorry, it didn't work.

55:58.610 --> 56:00.329
Hey, Robyn.

56:01.930 --> 56:04.764
Robyn, do you want to see something?

56:11.730 --> 56:14.768
I never liked seeing myself in mirrors.

56:14.890 --> 56:17.724
Imagine being one thing

56:17.850 --> 56:20.888
and then waking up here...

56:22.210 --> 56:23.610
...and you're me.

56:25.610 --> 56:28.444
His tongue was hanging out of his mouth.

56:33.570 --> 56:34.845
Fat...

56:34.970 --> 56:36.290
Pat!

56:38.410 --> 56:39.810
Fat Pat!

56:42.530 --> 56:45.204
I'm so jealous of people who look like you.

57:05.410 --> 57:07.083
- What does it want?
- Ssh!

57:07.210 --> 57:08.246
Robyn?

57:14.450 --> 57:16.521
It targeted Seb...

57:16.650 --> 57:18.767
once in the bedroom,

57:18.890 --> 57:20.882
once out there.

57:21.970 --> 57:25.361
Both sexual attacks, against a rapist.

57:27.330 --> 57:29.287
What about just now?

57:30.410 --> 57:32.402
What did you just say?

57:32.530 --> 57:34.567
I wish I looked like you.

57:35.850 --> 57:37.204
Jealousy.

57:38.330 --> 57:40.447
Seb was right.

57:41.610 --> 57:43.727
It is watching us.

57:43.850 --> 57:46.809
- It comes when we're...
- Screwing.

57:46.930 --> 57:48.159
Sinning.

57:49.770 --> 57:52.239
Why is the mirror here?

57:53.930 --> 57:57.048
We see ourselves as we are here,

57:57.170 --> 57:59.207
but you see the old you.

58:01.490 --> 58:03.686
It's like it's here to remind you.

58:05.170 --> 58:08.481
I know you think it's clever. It's not.

58:08.610 --> 58:10.567
It's an animal.

58:12.490 --> 58:15.403
It wants us to know what we are.

58:16.970 --> 58:18.245
Sinners.

58:19.330 --> 58:24.280
It's the worst way to communicate,
but we know to fear sin.

58:26.210 --> 58:28.566
Then we should answer back.

58:37.890 --> 58:40.200
- Are you sure Seb brought this with him?
- Yeah.

58:41.650 --> 58:44.529
You saw what happened
when it hit the bracelet.

58:44.650 --> 58:47.688
I don't know, I think maybe objects
brought from the real world...

58:47.810 --> 58:51.201
So because Seb brought that vodka
like Onie brought the bracelet,

58:51.330 --> 58:54.528
you think it can hurt it? The box, too?

58:54.650 --> 58:56.482
More than that.

58:57.530 --> 58:59.283
I think it'll hold it.

59:00.370 --> 59:02.726
She wants to go home so badly.

59:02.850 --> 59:04.489
Don't you?

59:06.650 --> 59:09.563
If I could see my mum again...

59:11.690 --> 59:15.445
There's a whole thing with you
where you don't think you're any good.

59:15.570 --> 59:17.801
But you are.

59:17.930 --> 59:20.729
What I think is, as soon as you believe that,

59:20.850 --> 59:24.127
you'll get to pick and then
when you go, "Foomph!"...

59:24.250 --> 59:26.401
you'll go for good.

59:29.570 --> 59:31.004
Why me?

59:33.090 --> 59:37.164
We need someone to do
whatever it is the demon comes out for.

59:37.290 --> 59:40.089
Seb's dead... again.

59:40.210 --> 59:42.406
We know it comes out for you.

59:45.930 --> 59:48.889
I wish I could take you with me.

59:49.010 --> 59:51.867
All right, you lesbo! Don't get clingy now.

59:51.990 --> 59:55.608
I know you don't... It doesn't matter.

59:55.730 --> 59:57.722
I just like you.

59:57.850 --> 01:00:00.968
I mean, from the minute
I pulled you out of the water, I...

01:00:01.090 --> 01:00:03.844
What did it? Who said it?

01:00:03.970 --> 01:00:06.326
- Onie. Onie was talking.
- Onie!

01:00:07.330 --> 01:00:10.050
- I need you in the kitchen now!
- I didn't mean to...

01:00:10.170 --> 01:00:12.844
- Come on, what did you say?
- She was talking about when we got here.

01:00:12.970 --> 01:00:15.644
- When she pulled me out of the water.
- She didn't! Seb did!

01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:18.888
- Onie, why did you lie?
- I just wanted to impress you.

01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:21.320
So you were taking credit
for something somebody else did?

01:00:21.450 --> 01:00:23.601
No, that's not true.

01:00:23.730 --> 01:00:25.687
Right, stand there.

01:00:25.810 --> 01:00:27.449
Give me the bracelet.

01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:31.846
Okay.

01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:36.249
Onie, I need you to bring it into us.
Tell us about the other times.

01:00:36.370 --> 01:00:37.804
No!

01:00:37.930 --> 01:00:39.808
Just... please try!

01:00:50.170 --> 01:00:51.729
Once, erm...

01:00:52.930 --> 01:00:55.843
I told my dad a Christmas present
was from me.

01:00:56.930 --> 01:00:58.284
It wasn't.

01:00:59.930 --> 01:01:01.523
Use this to bring it down.

01:01:01.650 --> 01:01:05.166
I got thanked for organising a party,
but I was just a guest.

01:01:07.770 --> 01:01:10.046
I just wanted to be liked.

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:15.682
And I did, I cheated.

01:01:15.810 --> 01:01:19.850
I got an old essay and just scanned it
and handed it in, like it was mine.

01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:21.529
I cheated.

01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:22.606
Livvy.

01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:25.124
The box.

01:01:27.370 --> 01:01:31.063
I cheated. I cheated. I fucking cheated!

01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:41.120
Now!

01:01:55.530 --> 01:01:57.442
It's working.

01:02:04.530 --> 01:02:06.408
Stay there!

01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:12.682
Can you speak?

01:02:15.770 --> 01:02:17.363
Yes.

01:02:18.730 --> 01:02:20.403
Speak.

01:02:22.610 --> 01:02:24.681
What's going on?

01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:30.969
Talk to us! Is this hell?

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:36.448
Not... yet.

01:02:38.410 --> 01:02:40.163
Soon.

01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:42.930
I can hurt you. Do you understand that?

01:02:46.210 --> 01:02:49.487
Now you stop me when I'm wrong.

01:02:51.450 --> 01:02:53.646
This is what we know.

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:56.569
We're in some... bubble.

01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:58.682
Hell's right outside.

01:02:59.730 --> 01:03:03.565
But this is made for us, from us,
from our memories.

01:03:06.970 --> 01:03:08.165
Yes.

01:03:10.770 --> 01:03:12.966
Tabula rasa.

01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:15.366
This house, it's...

01:03:15.490 --> 01:03:17.846
a fresh start, a clean slate.

01:03:17.970 --> 01:03:20.644
Do we get that because we're special?

01:03:20.770 --> 01:03:23.126
Not special.

01:03:24.730 --> 01:03:26.403
Then why?

01:03:28.610 --> 01:03:31.125
Because we all died together?

01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:33.401
It's just good timing?

01:03:35.970 --> 01:03:38.087
The bubble's shrinking.

01:03:39.530 --> 01:03:41.328
When it's closed...

01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:45.132
...do we get to go home?

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:51.166
Too... late!

01:03:56.290 --> 01:03:59.044
No shame!

01:03:59.170 --> 01:04:01.526
Everyone...

01:04:01.650 --> 01:04:04.290
fails.

01:04:04.410 --> 01:04:07.323
Everyone fails?

01:04:09.850 --> 01:04:11.170
Heaven...

01:04:11.290 --> 01:04:13.088
empty.

01:04:18.170 --> 01:04:20.401
Even the good are damned.

01:04:24.730 --> 01:04:27.882
- Nobody gets to heaven.
- Even the good are damned.

01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:33.720
You feel jealousy, pride, anger, lust.

01:04:33.850 --> 01:04:36.968
All the things that everyone does, every day.

01:04:37.090 --> 01:04:40.162
Fuck! You pull a sickie
or steal a parking space.

01:04:40.290 --> 01:04:43.681
A baby cries, demands warmth
and it's already selfish.

01:04:43.810 --> 01:04:46.689
It's fucked! It's a sinner!
It's going to hell!

01:04:46.810 --> 01:04:48.802
This is...

01:04:48.930 --> 01:04:51.126
the system.

01:04:51.250 --> 01:04:53.401
And now, here...

01:04:54.730 --> 01:04:57.040
...all we had to do...

01:04:58.090 --> 01:05:00.559
All they had to do...

01:05:00.690 --> 01:05:02.329
was be good.

01:05:02.450 --> 01:05:04.601
I was good!

01:05:05.730 --> 01:05:08.245
You know lust is a sin, right?

01:05:11.290 --> 01:05:14.727
We just needed to stay good
until the bubble closed.

01:05:20.410 --> 01:05:22.367
Did you make all this?

01:05:27.410 --> 01:05:28.526
You did.

01:05:28.650 --> 01:05:31.484
Eternity...

01:05:31.610 --> 01:05:33.203
insurance.

01:05:34.810 --> 01:05:37.325
The fail-safe? It's real?

01:05:40.610 --> 01:05:42.124
Hey, bitches!

01:05:43.850 --> 01:05:46.160
Guess we can't die twice.

01:05:48.330 --> 01:05:50.526
Se-e-e-b.

01:05:53.970 --> 01:05:56.402
- You!
- Seb, stop!!

01:06:01.730 --> 01:06:03.050
Seriously?

01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:04.286
Boo!

01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:17.249
Don't... move!

01:06:21.330 --> 01:06:23.890
Are you in there, little mate? Hmm?

01:06:24.010 --> 01:06:25.763
Little fuck buddy?

01:06:28.010 --> 01:06:30.320
You've got eternity, right?

01:06:40.650 --> 01:06:42.926
What shall we do?

01:06:43.050 --> 01:06:45.167
Can you hear me?

01:06:45.290 --> 01:06:47.009
I... hear.

01:06:49.210 --> 01:06:52.123
Is it true? Eternity insurance?

01:06:53.450 --> 01:06:56.887
If one of us got into heaven, would
the whole afterlife be destroyed?

01:06:57.010 --> 01:06:59.923
- That was just my dad's stupid...
- Wait!

01:07:01.770 --> 01:07:04.683
Does that mean I'm right?

01:07:07.570 --> 01:07:09.323
Tell me, please!

01:07:09.450 --> 01:07:11.806
Drink up! It's on me!

01:07:36.650 --> 01:07:37.845
Seb?

01:08:00.050 --> 01:08:01.564
Part...

01:08:06.210 --> 01:08:07.405
...Seb.

01:08:35.649 --> 01:08:37.642
I'll choke you, bitch!

01:08:37.770 --> 01:08:39.568
Good luck.

01:08:39.689 --> 01:08:41.841
I'm already dead.

01:09:47.370 --> 01:09:49.282
We're joined.

01:09:50.330 --> 01:09:52.242
I see what it knows.

01:09:53.410 --> 01:09:55.606
It knows what I did.

01:09:57.210 --> 01:09:58.769
What we all did.

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:03.806
I'll be punished forever.

01:10:07.930 --> 01:10:10.161
You, too.

01:10:30.490 --> 01:10:31.810
Hey.

01:10:31.930 --> 01:10:34.365
I think he broke her back.

01:10:37.290 --> 01:10:40.124
It was like he was possessed.

01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:42.162
But it was still him.

01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:44.929
His rage...

01:10:45.050 --> 01:10:47.610
his hate, his cruelty.

01:10:49.330 --> 01:10:50.969
Amplified.

01:10:51.090 --> 01:10:52.888
Uber-Seb.

01:10:54.330 --> 01:10:56.925
With the power to do anything he wanted.

01:10:57.970 --> 01:11:00.280
What if it had been one of us?

01:11:17.250 --> 01:11:20.209
Oh, God! Is she fucking tidying up?

01:11:22.330 --> 01:11:23.286
Yes.

01:11:23.410 --> 01:11:25.686
She fucking is.

01:12:03.770 --> 01:12:04.965
Look.

01:12:06.450 --> 01:12:07.725
Sunset.

01:12:08.770 --> 01:12:10.682
That's not the sun.

01:12:33.090 --> 01:12:35.161
Ready to be freaked out?

01:12:45.370 --> 01:12:46.963
Not long now...

01:12:49.530 --> 01:12:51.567
...and that's going to be us soon.

01:12:53.410 --> 01:12:55.527
It's no wonder they reach out.

01:12:56.650 --> 01:12:58.245
This must look like heaven to them.

01:13:02.450 --> 01:13:03.600
Present.

01:13:05.970 --> 01:13:08.530
- Fuck!
- I don't know what to say.

01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:10.687
Say thank you.

01:13:16.090 --> 01:13:19.003
Seb was the worst person
it could have possessed.

01:13:19.130 --> 01:13:21.247
To be amplified.

01:13:22.650 --> 01:13:25.324
But what if it was someone
who wanted something different.

01:13:27.090 --> 01:13:30.367
Who wanted to get you out of here?

01:13:36.970 --> 01:13:38.927
It's a blanket.

01:13:40.570 --> 01:13:43.130
And that was just a cool box.

01:13:51.090 --> 01:13:53.924
I'm glad you were here.

01:14:05.290 --> 01:14:07.725
I know I've made the right decision.

01:14:09.730 --> 01:14:10.925
Decision?

01:14:22.130 --> 01:14:24.247
I told her if she just...

01:14:25.370 --> 01:14:28.408
If she just realised
she was worth something,

01:14:28.530 --> 01:14:31.682
she could chose where she wanted to be.

01:14:33.930 --> 01:14:35.320
She chose!

01:14:37.810 --> 01:14:39.608
She chose!

01:15:16.010 --> 01:15:18.286
Still looking for answers?

01:15:19.410 --> 01:15:21.686
Just killing time.

01:15:23.290 --> 01:15:25.282
Stupid thing that happened to us...

01:15:25.410 --> 01:15:26.685
JJ's.

01:15:29.810 --> 01:15:31.847
A plane crash, sure.

01:15:31.970 --> 01:15:34.565
A train, a bomb.

01:15:34.690 --> 01:15:38.206
I died holding a pink drink
with an umbrella in it.

01:15:39.250 --> 01:15:40.206
Stupid.

01:15:40.330 --> 01:15:42.561
You're not stupid.

01:15:44.730 --> 01:15:46.801
Patricia and Onie.

01:15:46.930 --> 01:15:50.002
They wouldn't have
even been in JJ's normally.

01:15:51.250 --> 01:15:52.684
Why us?

01:15:52.810 --> 01:15:54.324
Why you?

01:15:55.610 --> 01:15:57.681
Maybe we're here because of you?

01:15:57.810 --> 01:16:01.645
- Why did they keep letting people in?
- The evil of money ladies, always is.

01:16:01.770 --> 01:16:06.128
Sometimes I have to push through
a contract early. Fudge the dates.

01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:08.970
People started getting crushed.

01:16:09.090 --> 01:16:11.241
Screaming. Blackness.

01:16:11.370 --> 01:16:14.249
Christ! You're in management, aren't you?

01:16:24.050 --> 01:16:25.848
Livvy, it's coming.

01:16:25.970 --> 01:16:28.690
Why were there so many people in there?

01:16:28.810 --> 01:16:30.449
Who kept letting them in?

01:16:44.530 --> 01:16:46.203
Throw it to me!

01:16:46.330 --> 01:16:47.889
I know, Robyn!

01:16:48.010 --> 01:16:50.320
I know what your sin is.

01:16:51.810 --> 01:16:55.565
I'm sorry but we're just going
to have to try my plan now, okay?

01:17:47.170 --> 01:17:48.729
That'll do.

01:17:50.210 --> 01:17:52.600
Yes.

01:18:21.610 --> 01:18:23.249
Robyn?

01:18:24.690 --> 01:18:26.727
Robyn, are you in there?

01:18:26.850 --> 01:18:28.325
Robyn?

01:18:40.810 --> 01:18:42.164
Do it!

01:18:50.970 --> 01:18:51.926
Catch!

01:19:02.050 --> 01:19:04.121
Robyn, I know you're in there.

01:19:04.250 --> 01:19:05.286
Listen.

01:19:05.410 --> 01:19:07.970
I know why you're trying to save us all.

01:19:08.090 --> 01:19:10.730
It's because you killed us all!

01:19:10.850 --> 01:19:13.570
You killed us all and you hid it!

01:19:14.850 --> 01:19:18.127
No stamp, because it was your club.

01:19:27.650 --> 01:19:32.042
If you're still Robyn under there,
you're still looking for a plan, right?

01:19:33.410 --> 01:19:35.242
Yes.

01:19:36.250 --> 01:19:38.481
You're going to take me to heaven.

01:19:39.650 --> 01:19:40.800
Yes!

01:19:41.530 --> 01:19:43.809
Eternity insurance!

01:19:46.570 --> 01:19:49.881
Take me there and
the whole afterlife is done.

01:19:51.810 --> 01:19:54.848
People get to live their lives and that's it.

01:19:56.170 --> 01:19:58.480
Only the pure get into heaven.

01:19:58.610 --> 01:20:01.648
No one stained, no one tainted.

01:20:01.770 --> 01:20:07.641
And if they ever did, the whole afterlife
would crumble and rot in an instant.

01:20:41.810 --> 01:20:43.881
I see what it sees.

01:20:44.930 --> 01:20:46.808
I see what it can do.

01:20:46.930 --> 01:20:48.887
It can go anywhere.

01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:52.087
The power is enormous.

01:20:53.890 --> 01:20:56.724
- I can use it to go home.
- No, Robyn!

01:20:56.850 --> 01:20:58.887
You have to let go of this.

01:21:00.170 --> 01:21:03.083
We have a chance to save
everything, everyone.

01:21:04.250 --> 01:21:06.082
I want to live.

01:21:10.130 --> 01:21:15.046
Go back and you'll live every day
knowing what's waiting for you here.

01:21:15.170 --> 01:21:18.447
Your brother, my mum.

01:21:18.570 --> 01:21:20.846
Anybody we love.

01:21:20.970 --> 01:21:23.724
Robyn, they all go to hell!

01:21:23.850 --> 01:21:26.604
You'll burn with Seb.

01:21:35.170 --> 01:21:38.402
Get... out!

01:21:39.570 --> 01:21:40.560
Patricia!

01:21:50.490 --> 01:21:52.607
You can save us.

01:21:54.170 --> 01:21:57.720
And anyone whoever died.
Every soul out there.

01:21:57.850 --> 01:21:59.762
Every soul ever.

01:22:01.810 --> 01:22:03.608
Take me to heaven.

01:22:04.810 --> 01:22:07.245
A suicide run, and I'm the bomb.

01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:11.330
No sinner ever gets into heaven.
Well, what if one did?

01:22:11.450 --> 01:22:13.203
To finish it?

01:22:13.330 --> 01:22:14.400
End...

01:22:14.530 --> 01:22:16.442
afterlife.

01:22:28.730 --> 01:22:30.926
End!

01:22:42.410 --> 01:22:44.367
I'm so sorry!

01:22:45.530 --> 01:22:47.840
It was the best I could come up with.

01:22:49.570 --> 01:22:50.924
Heaven?

01:22:52.050 --> 01:22:54.440
I don't think it will be there very long.

01:23:03.130 --> 01:23:04.564
Please!

01:23:04.690 --> 01:23:07.649
Robyn, we haven't got much time.

01:23:11.290 --> 01:23:13.680
We haven't got much time.

01:23:20.450 --> 01:23:21.520
Please!

01:23:28.690 --> 01:23:29.965
Please!

01:23:40.490 --> 01:23:42.686
Oh, Robyn!

01:24:00.730 --> 01:24:02.289
Just go.

01:24:04.210 --> 01:24:05.530
Please.

01:24:08.530 --> 01:24:09.805
Just go!

01:24:42.970 --> 01:24:45.326
Hey, Robyn...

01:24:45.450 --> 01:24:47.123
what if we see God?

01:24:47.250 --> 01:24:49.003
Seriously?

01:24:54.370 --> 01:24:56.362
What was your sin?

01:24:56.490 --> 01:24:58.561
Does it matter?

01:25:02.250 --> 01:25:03.479
Call it.

01:25:08.170 --> 01:25:09.320
Hey...

01:25:10.930 --> 01:25:12.887
...if you see God,

01:25:14.610 --> 01:25:17.000
you tell him to go fuck himself.
