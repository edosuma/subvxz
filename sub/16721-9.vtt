00:12.914 --> 00:15.459
I should be out there doing my job.

00:16.876 --> 00:19.838
[Krasner] Your job is out there
waiting for you, Detective.

00:19.921 --> 00:22.173
The question is,
how badly do you want it?

00:24.050 --> 00:27.679
You work for the department?
You a shrink?

00:27.762 --> 00:29.764
[Krasner] I was on the job for 15 years.

00:29.848 --> 00:31.725
I left to become a psychologist.

00:31.808 --> 00:33.101
[scoffs]

00:33.184 --> 00:35.895
I'm with the peer assistance program.
I'm a volunteer.

00:35.979 --> 00:38.565
Well, how about I volunteer
my way out of this chair,

00:38.648 --> 00:42.318
tell you to kiss my ass,
and talk to my union rep?

00:42.401 --> 00:44.988
Well, you could do that, sure.

00:46.155 --> 00:49.909
But your inspector would guarantee
that you'll be at your desk,

00:49.993 --> 00:53.121
and the only time you'll see the street
is in the parking lot,

00:53.204 --> 00:56.583
or if you go to get coffee, or...
look out the window.

01:01.212 --> 01:04.257
- This is voluntary, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:04.340 --> 01:06.468
- And off the record?
- Absolutely.

01:06.551 --> 01:10.263
So why are we doing this
in an interrogation room?

01:11.515 --> 01:14.518
You'd be more candid at a Starbucks?
Really?

01:15.685 --> 01:19.481
Mmm... Maybe at M&G's, after a shift.

01:19.564 --> 01:22.567
Still can't believe
that place went out of business.

01:22.651 --> 01:24.318
I miss Copeland's.

01:24.402 --> 01:26.738
[chuckling] Who doesn't?

01:30.909 --> 01:34.203
Whatever.
[inhales sharply] Let's do this.

01:35.914 --> 01:41.377
Detective Mercedes Kelly Knight,
badge 3-0-9-3-5.

01:41.460 --> 01:43.171
You know, you're not being recorded.

01:44.088 --> 01:45.549
Of course I am.

01:47.717 --> 01:50.720
You know this is bullshit, right?

01:50.804 --> 01:52.806
Things got rough with a hostile witness.

01:52.889 --> 01:55.559
You think that's the first time
this has ever happened?

01:58.770 --> 02:00.396
You lost control.

02:00.479 --> 02:04.358
[inhales] And it's all about control
with you, isn't it?

02:05.443 --> 02:06.945
I mean, that's why you were a point guard.

02:07.028 --> 02:09.447
You wanted to be the one
to distribute the ball, right?

02:09.531 --> 02:11.365
It's 'cause I was short,

02:11.449 --> 02:14.160
and it was the only way
I could get on the court, so...

02:14.243 --> 02:16.913
- 'Cause you had to play the game.
- It's not a game for me.

02:16.996 --> 02:18.372
Then why get benched

02:18.456 --> 02:21.710
for something as stupid
as getting physical with Claire Temple?

02:41.020 --> 02:44.733
[Stryker echoing] Do you love?
Do you love?

02:44.816 --> 02:46.067
Hmm?

02:46.901 --> 02:48.903
[Stryker] Oh, come on.
You're not gonna beg?

02:48.987 --> 02:51.239
Oh, come on. Not even a little bit?

02:51.322 --> 02:52.490
[crying]

02:53.324 --> 02:56.035
If you gonna kill me, then just do it.

03:12.969 --> 03:14.888
What shook you?

03:14.971 --> 03:17.807
Was it losing your gun to one suspect

03:17.891 --> 03:20.518
while trying to arrest another
without backup?

03:20.601 --> 03:22.436
Was it the extra eyes because of Scarfe?

03:22.520 --> 03:24.563
Was it this Luke Cage guy?

03:25.564 --> 03:27.901
What pushed you towards career suicide?

03:30.654 --> 03:31.988
[chuckles]

03:33.072 --> 03:36.159
You know how many times
I've been in this same goddamn box

03:36.242 --> 03:37.994
on the other side of the table?

03:39.704 --> 03:43.374
You think you are gonna break me?

03:45.376 --> 03:46.585
Bring it.

03:47.170 --> 03:50.715
Like I said,
this is not an interrogation.

03:50.799 --> 03:53.301
I'm not here to break you.

03:54.844 --> 03:57.013
You've already done that yourself.

03:57.096 --> 04:00.767
The question is, how broken are you?

04:01.685 --> 04:03.227
And can you be fixed?

04:06.648 --> 04:08.399
[truck engine revving]

04:11.695 --> 04:14.113
[groaning]

04:15.824 --> 04:17.867
[grunts]

04:18.993 --> 04:21.370
[breathing heavily]

04:29.754 --> 04:30.797
[groans]

04:47.313 --> 04:49.523
[sniffs] Ugh!

04:49.607 --> 04:51.067
Sweet Christmas.

04:54.278 --> 04:56.781
[theme music playing]

06:04.307 --> 06:06.350
[drumming]

06:09.979 --> 06:12.356
Hold up, hold up.
Somebody ain't playing that thing right.

06:12.440 --> 06:15.318
Tighten up over here.
Tighten up over here, all right?

06:15.401 --> 06:18.237
Let's do this, man. We rehearsed it.
Let's get this done.

06:19.948 --> 06:21.991
[playing R&B song]

06:26.287 --> 06:28.289
[singing]

06:56.817 --> 07:01.780
[Shades] So we've checked every truck,
every landfill in every borough.

07:01.865 --> 07:04.700
And for all of that, we've got...

07:04.783 --> 07:06.244
[sighs]

07:11.582 --> 07:13.292
Nothing yet.

07:13.376 --> 07:16.921
[Shades] Nothing yet. Nothing yet.

07:17.005 --> 07:19.257
[Stryker] Y'all can't find Luke Cage?

07:19.340 --> 07:22.844
What, he just dissipated?

07:24.929 --> 07:26.305
Like smoke?

07:30.101 --> 07:32.561
See, that's the thing.

07:35.564 --> 07:38.692
Where there's smoke, there's fire.

07:39.527 --> 07:40.862
- [gunshot]
- [gasps]

07:40.945 --> 07:42.196
- Shit!
- [musicians yelling indistinctly]

07:42.280 --> 07:44.198
[Darnell gasping]

07:48.995 --> 07:52.415
- There's nothing magical about it.
- [groaning]

07:52.498 --> 07:54.333
Follow the smoke.

07:57.670 --> 07:59.463
Or the damn garbage truck.

08:05.053 --> 08:08.014
[chuckles] Well...

08:09.432 --> 08:10.975
you ain't Houdini.

08:14.728 --> 08:17.190
And you ain't Rick
from <i>Casablanca,</i> neither.

08:18.816 --> 08:20.109
What?

08:21.277 --> 08:24.447
You thought you could
whisper in Mariah's ear...

08:25.448 --> 08:27.241
have her do your dirty work...

08:28.326 --> 08:30.536
then you're the new king
with the big desk?

08:31.579 --> 08:32.580
Hmm...

08:33.831 --> 08:35.124
Biggie photo...

08:36.042 --> 08:38.836
Delfonics crooning downstairs...

08:40.796 --> 08:42.506
You killed my friend, Shades.

08:43.674 --> 08:46.135
He was my number one seller.

08:46.219 --> 08:49.430
Who do you think gave him
that Barron Claiborne there?

08:52.266 --> 08:53.892
You don't have any friends.

08:53.977 --> 08:57.480
"A man of too many friends
comes to ruin,

08:57.563 --> 09:02.986
but there is a friend
who comes closer than a brother."

09:05.863 --> 09:07.991
Proverbs 18:24.

09:09.658 --> 09:12.078
Cornell Stokes was that friend for me.

09:13.204 --> 09:17.833
And I could trust him
like I could my own brother.

09:19.502 --> 09:21.212
Cornell was losing it.

09:22.130 --> 09:24.423
You trusted me to take care of him.

09:24.507 --> 09:28.344
I trusted you to take care of it,
not him.

09:29.220 --> 09:33.516
What? Did you think I was just gonna
give it all to you?

09:36.602 --> 09:37.979
[cocks gun]

09:40.731 --> 09:42.984
Give me one reason
why I shouldn't splatter

09:43.067 --> 09:45.653
this pristine desk
with your brain matter.

09:48.156 --> 09:50.866
[Zip] Because it won't help you find
Luke Cage any faster?

09:53.869 --> 09:56.372
[laughing]

10:00.626 --> 10:02.878
You're smarter
than your name implies, Zip.

10:04.588 --> 10:07.258
Two rule books
got me through the darkness.

10:09.718 --> 10:11.137
The Bible...

10:14.390 --> 10:16.684
and <i>The 48 Laws of Power.</i>

10:19.062 --> 10:20.938
Do you want to know what the 49th is?

10:24.192 --> 10:28.779
Luke Cage ain't dead
until you find his goddamn body.

10:31.282 --> 10:32.825
[breathing heavily]

11:01.145 --> 11:03.397
[grunts]

11:03.481 --> 11:05.066
[Megan on TV] <i>And today's top news,</i>

11:05.149 --> 11:07.610
<i>the shootout that occurred</i>
<i>in Harlem last night.</i>

11:07.693 --> 11:09.737
<i>After an ambulance was forced</i>
<i>off the street,</i>

11:09.820 --> 11:14.908
<i>it appears a chase led to a women's clinic</i>

11:34.678 --> 11:37.223
[news anchor] <i>Thanks, Megan.</i>
<i>In business news...</i>

11:37.306 --> 11:39.350
[news continues indistinctly on TV]

11:48.901 --> 11:51.737
- [Krasner] You had it rough recently.
- Where do you want to start?

11:52.571 --> 11:54.823
Who do you talk to when things get bad?

11:54.907 --> 11:56.909
I... [sighs]

11:58.619 --> 12:00.496
I used to talk to Scarfe.

12:02.039 --> 12:04.292
[stammers] No husband. A boyfriend?

12:07.670 --> 12:11.174
The last time somebody set me up,
I ended up arresting the guy at the table.

12:11.257 --> 12:12.300
- No.
- Yeah.

12:12.383 --> 12:13.676
I did a background check,

12:13.759 --> 12:16.470
and he was wanted for robbery
in three different states.

12:17.471 --> 12:19.432
They gave the dude a nickname
at my precinct.

12:19.515 --> 12:21.975
- Yeah?
- Called him the Love Bandit.

12:22.059 --> 12:24.395
I still get shit about it.

12:24.478 --> 12:27.565
I see everything and I forget nothin'.

12:29.149 --> 12:34.363
Every investigation, every suspect,
every murder, every crying mother...

12:34.447 --> 12:36.865
It is all in my head.

12:38.201 --> 12:39.952
So who's the last person you dated?

12:40.035 --> 12:41.745
- That's personal.
- That's why we're here.

12:53.216 --> 12:54.592
I met a guy at a bar.

12:55.343 --> 12:58.762
I wasn't nice to him, at all.

12:58.846 --> 13:01.432
[scoffs] But he didn't care.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.059
He was funny.

13:04.977 --> 13:06.354
He wasn't wearing a ring.

13:07.938 --> 13:12.610
And the first time he spoke to me,
even in a low cut dress,

13:12.693 --> 13:14.152
he looked at my eyes...

13:15.070 --> 13:16.280
not my breasts.

13:17.573 --> 13:20.493
- So?
- So, we talked.

13:21.619 --> 13:22.870
I could be myself.

13:22.953 --> 13:25.623
He thought I was pretty
and he told me so.

13:26.915 --> 13:28.041
We had coffee.

13:28.125 --> 13:29.668
[heavy breathing]

13:30.711 --> 13:33.005
I feel a "but" coming on.

13:33.922 --> 13:37.217
- But he wasn't who I thought he was.
- Just like Scarfe?

13:39.011 --> 13:40.513
How does that make you feel?

13:42.556 --> 13:44.600
How do you think it makes me feel?

13:50.898 --> 13:54.026
I didn't want it!

13:56.904 --> 14:00.866
[Mariah] You don't remember Jazmine.
How could you?

14:02.075 --> 14:05.746
She was fly. So damn fast.

14:07.080 --> 14:10.709
She used to drive Mama Mabel crazy
with all her boyfriends.

14:12.545 --> 14:14.922
Malik was special, though.

14:16.131 --> 14:17.675
He was talented.

14:19.302 --> 14:23.681
Played drums on a lot of those
Sugar Hill Records. The old ones.

14:26.934 --> 14:29.520
I really liked him.

14:32.147 --> 14:33.982
I thought they were good together.

14:36.485 --> 14:38.612
Mama Mabel couldn't stand him.

14:40.864 --> 14:42.866
She knew he was dabbling.

14:44.159 --> 14:45.744
Coke, smack.

14:53.126 --> 14:57.756
Malik wanted you, Cornell.
He did. But he OD'd.

14:59.633 --> 15:01.385
And then Jazzy ran off.

15:02.386 --> 15:05.348
She told me, "I'm not ready
to be nobody's mama."

15:06.640 --> 15:08.016
And she just left.

15:10.102 --> 15:11.687
She left you, and there you were,

15:11.770 --> 15:14.315
[stammering] wrapped in a blanket
in a basket.

15:16.900 --> 15:20.278
Mama Mabel put you
in my hands that very day.

15:23.782 --> 15:26.910
You always thought
I called you Mo for Cottonmouth.

15:28.036 --> 15:29.747
Mo was for Moses.

15:39.548 --> 15:41.717
I wasn't ready
to be nobody's mama, neither.

15:45.471 --> 15:49.850
I did try to protect you from
[stutters] all the shit.

15:51.143 --> 15:55.313
I tried... I tried to protect you
from yourself...

15:58.359 --> 15:59.818
but I didn't.

16:02.488 --> 16:03.656
[sniffles]

16:04.573 --> 16:05.908
[stammering] I'm...

16:17.085 --> 16:18.546
You did what you had to do.

16:20.213 --> 16:22.174
I don't know how this happened.

16:24.760 --> 16:26.554
You made a choice... [sighs]

16:28.180 --> 16:30.057
and now we have to pay the price.

16:32.518 --> 16:34.352
Diamondback is here to collect.

16:35.563 --> 16:37.355
Diamond-what?

16:37.440 --> 16:40.526
He's not happy
that Cornell is dead, and...

16:41.735 --> 16:43.487
Luke Cage is still alive.

16:44.405 --> 16:49.577
Cage is in the wind right now,
and I need your help to find him.

16:49.660 --> 16:51.161
Our frame doesn't work...

16:52.663 --> 16:55.082
if he's not there to take the blame.

16:55.165 --> 16:57.793
[stammers] What, you want me
to call the police?

16:57.876 --> 16:59.920
If it comes to that, sure.

17:00.003 --> 17:01.672
But right now...

17:03.006 --> 17:05.050
we have more pressing concerns.

17:05.133 --> 17:06.676
You keep saying "we."

17:09.680 --> 17:12.098
[chuckling] Well, you.

17:14.935 --> 17:16.228
Like it or not...

17:18.230 --> 17:19.647
the business is yours now.

17:19.732 --> 17:22.901
I have nothing to do with all of that.

17:22.984 --> 17:25.278
You are the face now.

17:25.362 --> 17:29.199
And nature abhors a vacuum.

17:31.409 --> 17:35.998
You have to ensure a smooth transition
for all of Cornell's clients,

17:36.081 --> 17:39.334
or it is going to be
straight up chaos for you.

17:42.546 --> 17:45.007
- [radio static]
- [officer] Dispatch, car 77-0-5.

17:45.090 --> 17:47.425
Sighting possible drunk.
Should we engage?

17:47.510 --> 17:48.844
[dispatcher] <i>Is it our suspect?</i>

17:48.927 --> 17:51.096
[officer] We've a black male,
but need verification.

17:51.179 --> 17:52.681
[siren wailing]

17:57.269 --> 17:58.562
[breathing heavily]

18:04.693 --> 18:07.905
Good morning. Is there a problem?

18:07.988 --> 18:10.866
No. You tell me. What's your name, son?

18:12.409 --> 18:15.954
[panting] I'm just taking a walk.
Minding my business.

18:16.038 --> 18:18.290
I need to see some ID.

18:18.373 --> 18:19.708
To walk?

18:20.626 --> 18:22.503
Turn around, take down your hoodie.

18:23.754 --> 18:26.840
- May I ask why?
- Because I said so.

18:34.932 --> 18:36.224
[sighs]

18:40.521 --> 18:41.605
[phone beeps]

18:44.024 --> 18:47.235
- Oh, shit. It is him!
- On the ground, now!

18:47.319 --> 18:51.031
Hands behind your back.
Get on the ground, now!

18:58.330 --> 19:00.248
I'm really sorry, guys.

19:01.792 --> 19:02.876
[officer] You're under arrest!

19:14.262 --> 19:15.305
[groans]

19:15.388 --> 19:17.600
[dispatcher] <i>Car 7-7-0-5, come in.</i>

19:25.315 --> 19:27.109
<i>Car 7-7-0-5, come in.</i>

19:32.030 --> 19:33.490
[screaming]

19:35.868 --> 19:37.202
[panting]

19:55.470 --> 19:57.014
Lemonade?

19:59.057 --> 20:01.977
- Popular drink.
- And it still is.

20:04.104 --> 20:05.939
That story in my file, too?

20:07.482 --> 20:08.901
What story?

20:12.362 --> 20:14.782
You know,
I don't believe everything I read?

20:18.786 --> 20:20.704
I wanna hear you tell it.

20:30.756 --> 20:32.382
[Misty] Summer of '95,

20:32.465 --> 20:38.513
and every other car was playing either
"Shook Ones" or "Ice Cream."

20:40.348 --> 20:42.893
I was hanging out
with my cousin, Cassandra.

20:45.437 --> 20:50.025
My mother told us never to walk around
the neighborhood by ourselves...

20:50.108 --> 20:54.154
but it was hot, and I was thirsty.

20:55.906 --> 21:00.285
And she was taking way too long
talking to some cute boy.

21:01.203 --> 21:02.329
So...

21:04.164 --> 21:09.252
I went to Ruiz Bodega by myself
and got a lemonade.

21:10.503 --> 21:12.297
When I got back, she was gone.

21:13.423 --> 21:17.678
It took the cops two weeks
to find her body.

21:18.636 --> 21:21.514
Disfigured, beaten.

21:24.017 --> 21:28.939
The boy, Mike Jones,
ran a train on her with his crew.

21:31.483 --> 21:33.986
Nobody snitched.

21:34.069 --> 21:37.364
Cops didn't push.
They didn't really give a shit.

21:38.866 --> 21:44.830
She was just another poor, worthless bitch
from the Polo Grounds.

21:45.831 --> 21:47.540
[breathing heavily]

21:49.251 --> 21:50.668
So that's why you became a cop?

21:50.753 --> 21:52.796
I apply foot to ass,

21:52.880 --> 21:56.049
and match lead for lead.

21:56.133 --> 21:58.301
I put murderers in handcuffs.

21:58.385 --> 22:03.098
I don't just seek justice, I stalk it.

22:03.181 --> 22:06.351
And that much should go in my record.

22:09.396 --> 22:12.024
With your resume,
you could've been downtown years ago.

22:12.107 --> 22:16.069
Hell, you could've been a fed,
but you chose to stay in Harlem.

22:16.153 --> 22:19.740
I know this place, I know the players...

22:20.783 --> 22:22.743
and I can make a difference here.

22:22.826 --> 22:25.245
Or use some
of those old school connections

22:25.328 --> 22:27.873
to make a little money on the side,
like your partner.

22:27.956 --> 22:30.000
I didn't know anything about Scarfe.

22:31.001 --> 22:32.836
Or anything he was doing.

22:32.920 --> 22:34.963
He didn't buy new clothes,

22:35.047 --> 22:39.717
no new watch, no new girlfriend,
no loose talk, nothing.

22:39.802 --> 22:42.095
But he'd been working
for Cottonmouth for years.

22:42.179 --> 22:44.306
And I trusted him...

22:45.598 --> 22:46.934
so I didn't see it.

22:47.017 --> 22:50.145
And neither did anybody else
in this damn department.

22:50.228 --> 22:52.439
So why do I get singled out for it?

22:52.522 --> 22:53.941
Because you were the closest to him.

22:55.192 --> 22:58.736
It's written all over your face.
Not seeing it bothered you, didn't it?

22:59.654 --> 23:02.074
'Cause seeing is my thing, right?

23:02.157 --> 23:05.410
That's what made me
such a good point guard.

23:05.493 --> 23:08.080
'Cause I could see everything in my head.

23:08.997 --> 23:11.708
I knew exactly where people were gonna be,

23:11.791 --> 23:14.169
so I put the ball
right where it needed to go.

23:14.252 --> 23:16.379
But you couldn't see Scarfe
for what he was.

23:17.380 --> 23:18.924
Or were you blinded by your emotions?

23:19.007 --> 23:21.301
[scoffs] You wouldn't say that
if I was a man.

23:21.384 --> 23:23.553
- Oh, that is not true.
- Bullshit!

23:24.554 --> 23:27.099
Male cops can screw cop groupies

23:27.182 --> 23:28.892
in the back of their unmarked
or their RMP,

23:28.976 --> 23:31.269
and you guys cheer.

23:32.270 --> 23:35.023
They get drunk
and fight each other in the parking lot,

23:35.107 --> 23:37.234
and it's called blowing off steam.

23:38.401 --> 23:40.278
There's always a double standard.

23:40.362 --> 23:42.822
[inhales] And you never screwed anyone

23:42.906 --> 23:45.783
that you shouldn't have
while you were on the job?

23:47.035 --> 23:48.078
No.

23:48.996 --> 23:50.788
But you choked out a witness.

23:51.706 --> 23:53.000
Own your shit.

23:54.126 --> 23:58.671
You went renegade
when you went after Luke Cage alone.

23:58.755 --> 24:00.715
And it got... [scoffs]

24:00.798 --> 24:02.592
way deeper than it should have.

24:02.675 --> 24:08.181
And this guy took the control
away from you when he took your gun.

24:09.682 --> 24:10.725
[gasps]

24:10.808 --> 24:12.519
Then you're in a room
alone with Miss Temple,

24:12.602 --> 24:14.854
and she insults you,
and you lost control...

24:15.939 --> 24:17.065
and you know it.

24:23.571 --> 24:24.948
I need a break.

24:35.375 --> 24:37.460
[exhales deeply]

24:47.930 --> 24:50.307
[indistinct chatter]

24:55.312 --> 24:56.939
[saw whirring]

24:58.065 --> 24:59.274
[Mariah] What happened in here?

25:00.608 --> 25:03.987
You know what happened here.
Same as you.

25:08.700 --> 25:10.577
Sorry to hear about Cornell.

25:10.660 --> 25:13.371
Hope they get that bastard.

25:13.455 --> 25:14.914
He's bad for business.

25:14.998 --> 25:18.376
Well, yeah, I'm not here
to talk about Luke Cage.

25:19.836 --> 25:22.672
Well, it took a lot for you to walk
through those doors without your people.

25:24.049 --> 25:25.842
<i>Chico,</i> please.

25:25.925 --> 25:29.429
I was from around here
long before you even knew what that was.

25:30.722 --> 25:36.853
Besides, we all contribute to this city,
one way or another.

25:37.562 --> 25:39.106
Contribute?

25:41.524 --> 25:45.820
I never trusted your cousin...
and I trust you even less.

25:46.989 --> 25:49.282
Pretending to rise
to the right side of the law.

25:49.366 --> 25:52.244
Girl, I know where you're from.

25:52.327 --> 25:54.662
That stank don't come off too easy.

25:58.583 --> 26:01.711
The thing my cousin built
needs to continue.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.963
And you're gonna be the one to run it?

26:04.047 --> 26:07.134
No. I need help.

26:09.344 --> 26:10.512
Me?

26:10.595 --> 26:12.264
Not just you.

26:13.765 --> 26:16.351
Cornell had steady customers.

26:16.434 --> 26:18.478
[Domingo chuckles]

26:18.561 --> 26:20.855
Not everybody liked your cousin.

26:20.938 --> 26:22.357
I mean, God respect the dead.

26:22.440 --> 26:26.153
Yeah, he got it done
without a lot of needless violence.

26:27.570 --> 26:31.824
I want everybody to come to the table
so I can discuss a transition.

26:32.742 --> 26:34.286
Maybe even a buyout.

26:37.830 --> 26:40.750
There was something dangerous
behind your eyes...

26:42.794 --> 26:44.587
and this is it, huh?

26:45.213 --> 26:47.715
Cornell was who he was.

26:47.799 --> 26:49.342
I want something different.

26:50.760 --> 26:54.681
I don't want to have
to look over my shoulder, Domingo.

26:54.764 --> 26:57.184
Gather all the bosses.

26:57.267 --> 27:00.312
I have a proposition
that will benefit us all.

27:01.979 --> 27:05.067
[inhales sharply]
So who gets an invitation?

27:06.234 --> 27:08.070
[breathing deeply]

27:09.071 --> 27:11.156
Jacques Alef with the Macoute...

27:12.657 --> 27:15.952
Neville Barnwell with the Yardies.

27:16.035 --> 27:18.246
Juan Carlos Castro with the Cubanos...

27:19.247 --> 27:22.959
And the Chinese, they got their own thing
going on downtown,

27:23.042 --> 27:25.628
but Peter Hong with the Koreans...

27:26.713 --> 27:28.631
he might wanna holla.

27:28.715 --> 27:29.966
When?

27:30.633 --> 27:32.760
Oh, that's gonna take me a few days.

27:33.470 --> 27:34.762
Tonight.

28:00.372 --> 28:02.374
[softly] Abalone shells.

28:22.059 --> 28:23.186
[sighs]

28:40.370 --> 28:42.455
[Luke whispering] Claire. Claire.

28:42.539 --> 28:44.874
[groaning]

28:44.957 --> 28:48.545
[softly] Everybody's looking for you.
How did you not get caught?

28:48.628 --> 28:51.339
- He shot you again?
- [groans]

28:54.176 --> 28:55.343
Ugh!

28:56.178 --> 28:58.846
Why in the hell is this guy
trying to kill you so bad?

28:59.931 --> 29:02.975
He's even going through the trouble of
using bullets that could actually do it.

29:04.018 --> 29:06.229
Willis was my, uh...

29:06.313 --> 29:07.564
my best friend.

29:08.356 --> 29:11.151
He's, uh... He's delusional.

29:11.234 --> 29:14.111
Delusional and pissed. Let me see.

29:16.906 --> 29:18.283
[groaning]

29:18.366 --> 29:19.951
[police sirens wailing in distance]

29:22.454 --> 29:23.955
[Claire] Ugh, your wound
is getting infected.

29:24.038 --> 29:25.373
- [grunts]
- This looks bad.

29:28.876 --> 29:31.796
- Who are you?
- What do you mean?

29:31.879 --> 29:34.299
[sighs] I should say, "What are you?"

29:36.176 --> 29:40.222
I'm looking at your cells
and I've never seen anything like it.

29:40.305 --> 29:44.309
I've been looking up sea shells to better
understand the structure of your skin.

29:45.643 --> 29:46.894
Like I said...

29:47.812 --> 29:49.397
you're amazing.

29:49.481 --> 29:51.774
Only one man knows the science.

29:53.818 --> 29:55.862
And I am not going back to prison.

29:57.154 --> 29:59.115
And is his name Dr. Noah Burstein?

30:00.492 --> 30:04.454
[sighs] You gave me Reva's hard drive,
remember?

30:05.162 --> 30:07.665
- Do you talk to him?
- No.

30:07.749 --> 30:09.667
Reva kept tabs...

30:10.668 --> 30:12.712
just in case someone got cute.

30:15.632 --> 30:18.385
But I am not ready to reopen that door.

30:20.762 --> 30:23.223
I don't think that you have
very much choice.

30:23.306 --> 30:25.475
We need to get you out of here.

30:27.059 --> 30:29.186
My mom has a car.

30:29.271 --> 30:30.688
And we haven't totaled that one yet.

30:31.648 --> 30:33.775
[chuckles and groans]

30:36.236 --> 30:37.529
[Alex] Excuse me.

30:38.780 --> 30:41.908
Excuse me? Madam Councilwoman?

30:41.991 --> 30:43.826
Not anymore.

30:43.910 --> 30:48.122
Have you seen the emails?
The interview requests?

30:48.205 --> 30:49.999
Even Thembi Wallace
wants another sit-down.

30:50.875 --> 30:52.126
Never.

30:53.378 --> 30:55.171
Can I show you something?

30:58.215 --> 31:00.760
Hit the news about 20 minutes ago.

31:00.843 --> 31:03.888
He attacked two cops and stole their cars.

31:03.971 --> 31:06.641
- Cage?
- The cops are alive.

31:06.724 --> 31:10.853
They GPS'd the car,
but someone leaked the footage.

31:10.937 --> 31:12.939
It was too hot to hold back.

31:13.022 --> 31:15.650
- [man screaming]
- [thuds]

31:17.777 --> 31:19.279
Huh. [chuckles]

31:21.113 --> 31:22.407
It's amazing.

31:23.366 --> 31:26.077
I know it's tough seeing the man
that killed your cousin.

31:28.663 --> 31:29.956
[Mariah sighs]

31:31.666 --> 31:35.086
They'll get him, Alex.
Justice will prevail.

31:37.339 --> 31:42.259
You know, Cornell taught me to be strong,
so I will be strong.

31:43.386 --> 31:45.179
People understand the threat...

31:46.180 --> 31:49.016
the kind of person you're up against.

31:49.100 --> 31:52.395
They're not talking about the money,
or where it came from.

31:54.397 --> 31:55.690
I think if you play this right,

31:55.773 --> 31:58.318
you could have supporters
with even deeper pockets behind you,

31:58.401 --> 32:00.612
who see this as a political issue,

32:00.695 --> 32:04.741
and see your cousin as a brave man
who stood up to a freak.

32:05.783 --> 32:10.204
You would use my personal tragedy
for strategic political advantage?

32:12.624 --> 32:15.752
- Madam Councilwoman, I...
- I taught you well.

32:19.756 --> 32:22.425
Go home, Alex.
I'm letting you off early.

32:25.011 --> 32:26.554
[Alex] Thank you.

32:44.781 --> 32:48.701
What happened out there...
that bothers you the most?

32:50.244 --> 32:51.371
I lost my gun.

32:51.454 --> 32:53.330
Other than that,
I wouldn't say it bothered me.

32:54.040 --> 32:57.752
I saw your hand shake the first time
you looked at this photo. Why?

33:06.803 --> 33:12.892
Because I remembered
seeing myself see myself...

33:14.143 --> 33:16.563
wondering what I would look like
in a casket.

33:19.982 --> 33:22.068
I mean, how the hell did I get there?

33:22.569 --> 33:26.113
He got the drop on me.
How in the hell did he do that?

33:26.197 --> 33:28.658
I could have disarmed him,
like, ten different ways.

33:28.741 --> 33:31.786
Why didn't I do any of that?

33:31.869 --> 33:35.081
I couldn't help anybody,
not even my damn self.

33:35.164 --> 33:40.294
He shoved my gun in my face...

33:40.377 --> 33:41.879
and I froze.

33:43.339 --> 33:45.675
And you know what I thought about?

33:45.758 --> 33:50.597
I thought about Pop's funeral.
I thought about my own funeral.

33:50.680 --> 33:53.099
I thought about my father,

33:53.182 --> 33:55.643
and what people would think about me.

33:56.894 --> 33:58.688
And this guy...

34:02.066 --> 34:05.445
this guy was smiling...

34:07.029 --> 34:10.407
[voice breaking]
while he was toying with my life.

34:10.492 --> 34:12.284
It was fun for him.

34:15.286 --> 34:19.041
I didn't have control,

34:19.125 --> 34:22.504
and maybe I never did.

34:22.587 --> 34:26.172
And when Claire
was talking sideways about me,

34:26.257 --> 34:29.594
all I wanted to do
was take my control back.

34:43.315 --> 34:45.150
Oh, my God.

34:45.234 --> 34:47.069
[exhales] What have I done?

34:47.152 --> 34:48.362
[inhales sharply]

34:49.781 --> 34:50.782
[sniffles]

34:51.699 --> 34:54.368
It's like anything else
you've learned on the job.

34:55.244 --> 34:56.704
It's ugly...

34:57.580 --> 34:59.456
but you can't move your gaze.

34:59.541 --> 35:03.127
You have to look... and learn.

35:04.879 --> 35:06.548
That's how you get answers.

35:10.342 --> 35:12.219
That's how you win.

35:19.101 --> 35:20.227
[sighs heavily]

36:08.400 --> 36:10.737
[groaning]

36:13.364 --> 36:15.532
[Luke breathing heavily]

36:17.243 --> 36:19.746
- [Luke] It's getting harder to breathe.
- [exhales]

36:19.829 --> 36:22.539
- [groans] These wounds are kicking my ass.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

36:22.624 --> 36:25.292
You know, it passed before,
it's gonna pass again, okay?

36:25.376 --> 36:26.753
I promise.

36:26.836 --> 36:29.005
Can I get that
with the money-back guarantee?

36:29.088 --> 36:31.173
- [both chuckle]
- [grunts]

36:31.257 --> 36:32.592
Breathe.

36:32.675 --> 36:34.343
[breathing deeply]

36:36.512 --> 36:38.014
See? You got this.

36:44.186 --> 36:45.605
What if this is a one-way trip?

36:45.688 --> 36:48.190
Hey, hey, you are gonna make it.

36:48.274 --> 36:51.277
You hear me?
You're gonna make it just fine.

36:51.360 --> 36:53.613
We're gonna fix this.

36:53.696 --> 36:55.031
Don't even.

36:55.114 --> 36:57.574
- You're not dying in my mom's car.
- [chuckles]

36:57.659 --> 36:59.035
Okay?

37:00.536 --> 37:01.954
[sighs]

37:08.377 --> 37:10.755
It's the part you can't fix
that's bothering me.

37:12.256 --> 37:13.507
What do you mean?

37:14.425 --> 37:15.551
Willis.

37:16.343 --> 37:19.138
Willis Stryker.
He thinks he's my brother.

37:21.057 --> 37:22.516
Diamondback.

37:23.726 --> 37:28.981
He's... he's gotta be lying
about my father. He's...

37:30.566 --> 37:32.777
He's... He can't be my brother.

38:02.849 --> 38:04.100
[knocking on door]

38:12.358 --> 38:15.319
[Claire] Hi. Sorry to ring so late.

38:16.112 --> 38:17.739
My name is Sandra Lopez.

38:17.822 --> 38:22.034
I'm currently majoring in prison studies
at Boston University, and, uh,

38:22.118 --> 38:23.577
I was just wondering if I could ask you

38:23.660 --> 38:25.913
a few questions
about your time at Seagate.

38:25.997 --> 38:27.999
My friend said that you worked there?

38:28.082 --> 38:29.666
Your friend was mistaken.

38:30.584 --> 38:33.420
- What friend?
- Carl Lucas.

38:34.756 --> 38:36.298
I don't know anybody by that name.

38:39.260 --> 38:40.344
He's alive, Doc.

38:40.427 --> 38:42.972
- That's impossible.
- Your experiment worked.

38:43.597 --> 38:45.057
It changed him.

38:46.475 --> 38:48.102
Changed how?

38:48.895 --> 38:51.022
You should see for yourself.

38:51.773 --> 38:53.816
- He's here?
- Yes.

38:56.485 --> 38:57.779
Where is he?

39:12.919 --> 39:15.087
What's up, Doc?

39:16.297 --> 39:18.007
I've always wanted to say that.

39:19.300 --> 39:20.592
Let's get him out of here.

39:21.260 --> 39:23.179
- [groaning]
- Put him on the couch.

39:23.262 --> 39:24.931
[Claire] Come on. Just a few more steps.

39:25.848 --> 39:26.933
- [Luke groaning]
- [Claire] Easy, easy.

39:27.016 --> 39:29.476
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Take it easy.

39:30.394 --> 39:31.687
Breathe.

39:32.646 --> 39:35.107
Breathe. Okay.

39:36.025 --> 39:37.193
[Luke sighs]

39:38.527 --> 39:41.613
You've got no scars. Nothing.

39:42.531 --> 39:44.283
That lab was totally destroyed.

39:45.326 --> 39:46.743
You mean it worked?

39:47.703 --> 39:50.747
Yes... and no.

39:52.374 --> 39:54.877
Until last night... [breathing heavily]

39:56.378 --> 39:58.714
I was bulletproof.

39:58.798 --> 40:02.468
Jesus Christ, kid. What did this to you?

40:03.385 --> 40:06.638
They shot me with some crazy bullets.

40:06.722 --> 40:08.640
They exploded inside of him.

40:08.724 --> 40:10.642
[Burstein] He should be dead.

40:10.726 --> 40:14.063
My skin is now tough... like armor.

40:14.146 --> 40:16.023
I think maybe what makes him stronger

40:16.107 --> 40:18.734
is also pushing the shrapnel
deeper into his organs.

40:19.651 --> 40:23.655
Trust me, it is impossible
to cut into his skin.

40:26.075 --> 40:28.410
Look, I don't know what it is
that you think I can do for you.

40:28.494 --> 40:31.788
My lab is not my lab anymore.
I wouldn't know where to begin.

40:31.873 --> 40:33.582
What if we can help you with that?

40:34.208 --> 40:35.626
Reva took this.

40:36.627 --> 40:38.004
[Burstein gasps]

40:40.506 --> 40:42.424
She shouldn't have done that. [sighs]

40:46.012 --> 40:47.596
Can you unlock it?

40:54.228 --> 40:55.646
[sighs]

41:01.152 --> 41:02.653
[Burstein] Oh, my God.

41:03.946 --> 41:06.073
It's all here. Everything.

41:06.157 --> 41:07.658
Everything you need?

41:08.575 --> 41:11.453
Everything I lost. So much more....

41:11.537 --> 41:12.997
[Claire sighs]

41:14.040 --> 41:15.958
Reva died for this, didn't she?

41:17.834 --> 41:19.836
Luke refuses to talk about it.

41:20.587 --> 41:22.298
[coughing]

41:24.341 --> 41:25.968
[Claire] You okay?

41:30.264 --> 41:31.265
[gasps]

41:32.558 --> 41:34.101
[Luke groans] They're killing me.

41:35.519 --> 41:38.147
Doc, you figure this shit out.

41:55.664 --> 41:57.291
[Luke groaning]

41:57.374 --> 41:58.875
[Burstein] Watch your step.

42:01.587 --> 42:04.673
- All right. Can you stand a second?
- [Claire] I got him.

42:08.427 --> 42:10.471
- [Claire] Okay.
- [Luke] All right.

42:13.140 --> 42:15.559
[breathing heavily]
What is all this stuff?

42:16.518 --> 42:18.645
[Burstein] During the cover-up,
I stole whatever I could.

42:19.896 --> 42:20.982
[Luke] What cover-up?

42:21.065 --> 42:23.067
They couldn't advertise Rackham's death,

42:23.150 --> 42:24.901
or the explosion
that supposedly killed you,

42:24.986 --> 42:27.529
or Reva's data dump,
so they... they killed the whole thing.

42:29.656 --> 42:31.951
- Here, let's set him down.
- [breathing heavily]

42:32.034 --> 42:33.119
I was so close to a breakthrough.

42:33.202 --> 42:35.121
That all ended when they thought
you were dead.

42:35.204 --> 42:38.540
- [all groaning]
- [Burstein] I started again from scratch,

42:38.624 --> 42:42.003
but never came close
to replicating the Seagate incident.

42:42.086 --> 42:44.713
[stammers] I'm a nurse.
I know the drill. I can help.

42:46.132 --> 42:47.508
[Luke groans]

42:48.217 --> 42:49.635
Why me?

42:50.552 --> 42:52.138
Why did you pick me?

42:53.097 --> 42:55.432
Because you were strong.
Stronger than most.

42:56.350 --> 42:57.851
[Luke] That's not what Reva said.

42:58.769 --> 43:00.937
She said she begged you to do it.

43:02.523 --> 43:05.067
There's more to it than that,
and you know it.

43:05.151 --> 43:08.404
She begged me, but you were
already tabbed for the program.

43:10.572 --> 43:13.742
- Didn't Reva tell you about this?
- No.

43:14.951 --> 43:16.412
That's not gonna do anything.

43:19.290 --> 43:20.457
- [Burstein grunts]
- [scalpel snaps]

43:21.625 --> 43:23.169
Oh, my God.

43:24.211 --> 43:27.714
Look, I gotta get a blood sample
to cross check with Reva's data.

43:27.798 --> 43:30.926
Your DNA may be the X factor
that made this whole thing work.

43:31.010 --> 43:34.263
- You mean, it could only work for Luke?
- [Burstein] Yeah, maybe.

43:35.556 --> 43:37.724
This wound is too septic
to get a decent sample.

43:37.808 --> 43:39.851
Are you saying
you can't recreate what you did?

43:39.935 --> 43:43.689
It's not as straightforward as that.
You know, penicillin, the X-ray machine...

43:43.772 --> 43:45.274
[groans]

43:45.357 --> 43:48.319
[Burstein] ...the smallpox vaccine,
pacemaker, even... even...

43:48.402 --> 43:49.445
even Viagra.

43:49.528 --> 43:52.739
Those were accidents.
It's the same with Carl.

44:01.915 --> 44:03.209
This could work.

44:04.168 --> 44:06.170
If you go down his throat...

44:08.505 --> 44:10.507
We can puncture his mucus membrane.

44:10.591 --> 44:12.301
- Exactly.
- I like the way you think.

44:14.886 --> 44:15.971
I don't.

44:17.181 --> 44:18.474
Sorry.

44:19.808 --> 44:22.644
All right. Put your head back.
Just open your mouth.

44:24.146 --> 44:25.897
I'll try to make this quick.

44:28.484 --> 44:29.693
Breathe through your nose.

44:35.157 --> 44:36.492
[groaning]

44:36.575 --> 44:39.828
[Burstein] Easy, easy. Oh, here we go.

44:40.662 --> 44:42.289
[Burstein] It's working.

44:56.470 --> 44:57.763
[Ridley] You see that?

45:00.849 --> 45:03.519
- That's my shield.
- No, no, no.

45:04.895 --> 45:06.480
That's not your shield.

45:06.563 --> 45:09.483
That shield belongs
to the city of New York and its people.

45:11.402 --> 45:12.736
And when you lose control,

45:12.819 --> 45:15.656
go upside somebody's head
because you had a bad day...

45:16.657 --> 45:18.450
or you feel powerless...

45:19.410 --> 45:22.788
- or you screw the wrong person...
- I didn't screw anybody.

45:22.871 --> 45:24.206
Come on, now.

45:31.297 --> 45:34.425
You don't deserve to represent
the people of New York,

45:34.508 --> 45:36.092
let alone protect them.

45:36.177 --> 45:38.637
That's not true and you know it.

45:38.720 --> 45:39.763
I do.

45:41.473 --> 45:45.227
Look, we're wired differently.

45:46.812 --> 45:48.272
We run towards gunfire.

45:48.355 --> 45:50.982
We drink when we're sad.
We screw when we're mad.

45:51.066 --> 45:55.654
And people hate us until they need us.

45:57.448 --> 45:59.157
And I hate that.

46:02.703 --> 46:04.746
But I love it, too.

46:10.836 --> 46:12.629
[Ridley] We walk a higher path.

46:14.756 --> 46:17.676
It's not simple. It's very hard.

46:17.759 --> 46:21.263
And that is why
people will always need us.

46:32.274 --> 46:34.818
Hero of Harlem, my ass.

46:37.571 --> 46:38.739
[sighs]

46:41.199 --> 46:45.120
Look, if we're talking about a right path,
it's not just about Luke Cage.

46:46.872 --> 46:51.042
You haven't even acknowledged the guy
that held a gun to my head last night.

46:51.126 --> 46:52.711
We will find out who that is.

46:52.794 --> 46:54.546
And we still need
to talk about Mariah Dillard.

46:54.630 --> 46:56.632
She is not innocent in all this.

46:56.715 --> 46:59.468
Look, Mariah's not on the run for murder,
assaulting two police officers.

46:59.551 --> 47:05.056
I need you to focus
on bringing in Luke Cage.

47:09.811 --> 47:11.938
Bullets bounce right off of him.

47:12.856 --> 47:15.609
Reason is the only thing
that's gonna work.

47:16.943 --> 47:19.988
And it has to come
from somebody he trusts.

47:20.071 --> 47:21.740
[Ridley chuckles]

47:22.949 --> 47:24.285
[laughs]

47:30.791 --> 47:32.167
Go get him.

47:51.520 --> 47:52.896
You ready for this?

47:52.979 --> 47:56.107
Like I said, ready as ever.

47:56.191 --> 47:58.193
You need to understand where you are here.

47:59.110 --> 48:03.198
If they sense any weakness,
any hesitation...

48:03.281 --> 48:05.701
you're not just done politically...

48:05.784 --> 48:07.411
you're done permanently.

48:22.426 --> 48:23.427
You're late.

48:24.094 --> 48:27.639
I'm not. Looks like I'm right on time.

48:27.723 --> 48:29.350
Wagwan?

48:32.268 --> 48:36.440
Now that my cousin is gone,
I'm making a few changes.

48:36.523 --> 48:40.318
I loved my cousin,
but I didn't like what he did.

48:40.402 --> 48:41.903
Until he stopped serving you.

48:42.821 --> 48:45.949
Cut the crap, lady.
What do you want to tell us?

48:48.034 --> 48:49.285
I'm out.

48:51.913 --> 48:56.334
My family is no longer to be associated
with what you all do.

48:57.252 --> 48:59.755
I need to move
in a more legitimate direction.

48:59.838 --> 49:00.839
[Jacques] Need?

49:00.922 --> 49:02.674
That's a weak hand you're playing.

49:02.758 --> 49:06.177
My cousin has valuable assets
and connections.

49:07.095 --> 49:10.306
I'll give them to you... for a price.

49:13.268 --> 49:16.187
- And you walk away?
- I walk away.

49:16.271 --> 49:18.482
Why do I find that hard to believe?

49:18.565 --> 49:22.444
Because you're smart and stupid
at the same time.

49:23.111 --> 49:26.031
Diamondback, what are you doing here?

49:26.114 --> 49:27.616
You invited me...

49:27.699 --> 49:29.535
by not inviting me.

49:35.206 --> 49:37.793
- Excuse me?
- Now, Peter...

49:38.710 --> 49:41.087
when you don't buy my wares,
or Jacques...

49:42.130 --> 49:45.717
when you get them at a cheaper price
from my competitors,

49:45.801 --> 49:47.678
you're messing with my money.

49:47.761 --> 49:49.638
And that pisses me off.

49:49.721 --> 49:51.723
- [gunshot]
- [Jacques] Hey, man!

49:53.349 --> 49:54.560
[grunting]

49:59.189 --> 50:02.734
[Stryker] Anybody else not made it
to confessional this week?

50:02.818 --> 50:06.154
- [men breathing heavily]
- Your men outside are dead.

50:06.237 --> 50:08.949
Your greed superseded your common sense.

50:09.032 --> 50:13.203
So now, I have the pulpit.

50:16.039 --> 50:19.543
Rich men, camel and needles.

50:20.461 --> 50:21.795
What do you want?

50:22.754 --> 50:24.130
Hey, Neville...

50:25.215 --> 50:26.925
[in mock Jamaican accent]
if you wanna test me...

50:27.008 --> 50:30.136
[stammering] Ease up, man.
I got no hackle with you now.

50:30.220 --> 50:33.515
- We'll listen what you have to say.
- Don't bother.

50:33.599 --> 50:36.477
Just by being here, you're already dead.

50:36.560 --> 50:38.729
- [gunshot]
- [groans]

50:39.480 --> 50:41.314
Two for the price of one.

50:41.397 --> 50:43.191
[Domingo] What are you doing, man?

50:44.109 --> 50:45.819
You're gonna start a war.

50:46.903 --> 50:49.197
"And then many will fall away,

50:50.866 --> 50:54.578
and they will betray each other
and hate one another.

50:54.661 --> 50:59.332
And many false prophets will arise
and lead many astray.

51:00.458 --> 51:03.545
But the one who endures to the end...

51:04.963 --> 51:06.673
he will be saved."

51:07.674 --> 51:09.092
[Domingo] You're crazy.

51:14.681 --> 51:19.019
Crazy would be leaving you alive
to run a very profitable drug business.

51:20.020 --> 51:24.024
But I got no beef with your cousins
down south of the border...

51:25.108 --> 51:27.068
so today is your lucky day.

51:29.362 --> 51:30.572
But you...

51:31.197 --> 51:32.824
You...

51:33.950 --> 51:35.702
you're full of crazy.

51:37.162 --> 51:39.915
I just killed four people, and...

51:41.124 --> 51:43.168
you didn't even flinch.

51:45.128 --> 51:46.755
You don't scare me.

51:48.298 --> 51:49.507
No...

51:50.425 --> 51:52.010
I don't think I do.

51:54.220 --> 51:56.640
Tell me why we should be friends.

52:03.521 --> 52:04.940
Luke Cage.

52:05.941 --> 52:08.276
Clearly, we both have issues with him.

52:08.902 --> 52:12.989
I heard he killed your cousin.
Allegedly.

52:13.073 --> 52:17.368
Rest assured, I will end him
when the time is right.

52:17.452 --> 52:19.580
But the time is not right.

52:20.622 --> 52:24.292
Have you even seen the dashboard footage
that's all over the news?

52:25.293 --> 52:27.087
You don't you see the opportunity?

52:28.088 --> 52:31.675
You see a man you want dead who won't die.

52:32.759 --> 52:35.011
I see a marketer's dream.

52:36.054 --> 52:38.139
Why spend all your time

52:38.223 --> 52:41.852
killing and intimidating
your criminal customers in the dark

52:41.935 --> 52:46.356
when you should be selling guns
to police departments in the light?

52:46.439 --> 52:49.400
Guns that can handle these new threats.

52:55.031 --> 52:56.449
Go on.

53:01.162 --> 53:04.165
Word is you have a weapon
that can take him down.

53:05.083 --> 53:06.710
Kill Luke Cage.

53:07.585 --> 53:11.632
But if you do, and you go big,

53:11.715 --> 53:14.926
everyone else will come to you

53:15.010 --> 53:17.638
to help take down
the rest of these super-freaks

53:17.721 --> 53:21.016
that are upsetting
the natural order of things.

53:21.099 --> 53:23.476
You gotta go big pharma on this shit.

53:24.560 --> 53:28.815
You invent the disease,
then you sell the cure.

53:29.524 --> 53:30.901
[chuckles]

53:32.068 --> 53:35.822
Oh, Shades, now I see you were right.

53:39.910 --> 53:42.663
I like how she thinks.

53:42.746 --> 53:45.331
And who better to broker the deals, hmm?

53:46.541 --> 53:48.376
No. No, I'm out of this.

53:48.459 --> 53:50.796
[Stryker] No... You're in...

53:52.005 --> 53:54.632
way into this...

53:54.716 --> 53:57.302
until I decide otherwise.

53:58.511 --> 53:59.595
Domingo.

54:01.765 --> 54:03.975
Sorry about the mess, <i>hermano.</i>

54:05.185 --> 54:08.063
But I have no doubt...

54:09.064 --> 54:10.857
you have people that can clean up.

54:10.941 --> 54:12.984
Why am I still alive, man?

54:14.695 --> 54:16.947
[Stryker] 'Cause no one's coming at me.

54:18.031 --> 54:20.116
They'll ask around, so tell 'em...

54:21.242 --> 54:23.704
I'll murderize everything in sight.

54:24.955 --> 54:27.708
'Cause I don't care and I won't quit.

54:28.709 --> 54:31.169
You can't bargain with me.

54:32.253 --> 54:34.923
You buy or you die.

54:37.759 --> 54:38.969
[Stryker sighs]

54:39.970 --> 54:42.180
You think Peter Luger's is still open?

55:00.656 --> 55:02.658
[R&B song playing]

55:09.582 --> 55:11.501
[singing]

55:48.704 --> 55:50.248
[inaudible]

56:00.341 --> 56:05.013
That footage of Cage and the cops?
It went viral.

56:05.096 --> 56:06.431
What do you want to do about it?

56:06.514 --> 56:09.851
That's great... That's great.

56:09.935 --> 56:12.603
He's got nowhere to run now.
We'll find him.

56:13.814 --> 56:16.149
- It's all coming together.
- But there's gonna be a...

56:16.232 --> 56:17.483
Shh!

56:19.235 --> 56:20.778
I like this song.

56:20.862 --> 56:22.780
[R&B song continues]

56:40.173 --> 56:41.799
[song continues]

57:20.421 --> 57:24.634
[Burstein] We were working on creating
this artificial skin for burn victims.

57:25.635 --> 57:27.387
We used a process called CRISPR

57:27.470 --> 57:30.765
to fuse the subject's DNA
with another DNA to gain its attributes.

57:30.849 --> 57:33.184
The foreign DNA
was abalone shell, wasn't it?

57:33.268 --> 57:35.937
Uh, yeah.
Where did you do your residency?

57:37.522 --> 57:42.318
145th Street. Um...
and my fellowship in Hell's Kitchen.

57:44.404 --> 57:46.031
Well, you're correct.

57:46.114 --> 57:50.576
We already used abalone to build
better combat equipment for soldiers.

57:50.660 --> 57:54.372
And to genetically enhance
the durability, pliability,

57:54.455 --> 57:56.666
and healing properties of human epidermis.

57:57.625 --> 58:00.711
Okay, so why are these bullets
penetrating his skin then?

58:00.795 --> 58:02.047
Are they dipped in something?

58:03.631 --> 58:05.466
Uh, well, perhaps.

58:05.550 --> 58:07.177
But more likely
because of what they were made from.

58:07.260 --> 58:09.804
You see, uh,
abalone is nearly impenetrable, but...

58:09.888 --> 58:10.889
[Claire] Right.

58:10.972 --> 58:13.433
...its stacked plates can be pushed apart
under the right circumstances.

58:13.516 --> 58:15.143
[Luke] Like what?

58:15.226 --> 58:16.602
Hey.

58:16.686 --> 58:20.481
[stammers] During the experiment,
your skin cells were bonded

58:20.565 --> 58:24.152
with hydrogen covalent bonds
at the exact point of acidity,

58:24.235 --> 58:27.572
- temperature and saline concentration...
- English, please.

58:27.655 --> 58:30.951
Well, see, I can replicate
exactly the acidity

58:31.034 --> 58:33.328
and the saline portions of the experiment

58:33.411 --> 58:35.580
with the information
that's on the Reva drive that you brought.

58:35.663 --> 58:38.666
But the...
the wild card is the temperature.

58:39.709 --> 58:42.212
Because of what Albert Rackham did,
turning up the heat on the bath,

58:42.295 --> 58:46.882
I have no gauge as to the temperature
that catalyzed the experiment.

58:46.967 --> 58:50.636
How are you going
to get this stuff out of me?

58:50.720 --> 58:52.055
Right. Uh... [sighs]

58:53.056 --> 58:56.601
Imagine that your skin
works like a form of Velcro,

58:56.684 --> 58:59.270
uh, under a sort of lock and key.

58:59.354 --> 59:02.023
And in order to cut through it,
he's got to weaken the lock and key,

59:02.107 --> 59:04.400
so we can remove the shrapnel.

59:04.484 --> 59:06.444
- How do you plan to do that?
- [Claire sighs]

59:06.527 --> 59:09.739
Uh, I'm going to dip your skin
in boiling acid,

59:09.822 --> 59:11.950
and then, uh, remove the shrapnel.

59:19.457 --> 59:22.043
What? I've tried it with animals.

59:22.127 --> 59:23.962
He's putting me in a rotisserie spit?

59:24.920 --> 59:26.631
Um...

59:26.714 --> 59:28.591
I think he wants to deep fry you...

59:30.426 --> 59:31.927
like a turkey.

59:32.012 --> 59:35.015
Now, look, we're only gonna have
a short window to do this, uh,

59:35.098 --> 59:37.100
before your skin closes up again.

59:39.227 --> 59:42.313
Just so we're clear,
what could go wrong?

59:43.481 --> 59:46.359
[Burstein] Well, your... your skin
could peel off like wax paper, and, uh,

59:46.442 --> 59:48.778
after about ten seconds,
you'd beg me to put a bullet in your head

59:48.861 --> 59:50.238
because the pain would be so bad.
But your...

59:51.031 --> 59:54.450
your head looks fine, so I... I guess
the bullet would ricochet off your skull.

59:54.534 --> 59:55.910
[Claire sighs]

59:57.453 --> 59:59.372
Sweet Christmas.

01:00:12.468 --> 01:00:14.345
If the procedure gets too painful,

01:00:14.429 --> 01:00:17.348
just raise your hand in a fist
and I'll shut it down, okay?

01:00:17.432 --> 01:00:18.724
Like this?

01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:21.644
- Right on.
- [Luke chuckles]

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:26.274
You trust this dude?

01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:28.193
Hell no.

01:00:28.276 --> 01:00:29.610
[breathing heavily]

01:00:29.694 --> 01:00:33.989
If anything happens to me,
if anything goes wrong,

01:00:34.074 --> 01:00:36.659
make sure he doesn't keep Reva's data.

01:00:36.742 --> 01:00:39.245
It cannot fall into the wrong hands.

01:00:39.329 --> 01:00:41.497
I don't care if you have to kill him.

01:00:43.249 --> 01:00:45.960
I got you. But let's not go there, okay?

01:00:46.044 --> 01:00:47.753
I'm serious.

01:00:47.837 --> 01:00:50.173
- It's too dangerous.
- [sighs]

01:00:50.256 --> 01:00:53.468
We can't have guys like me
running around on every corner.

01:00:53.551 --> 01:00:55.886
What are you talking about?

01:00:55.970 --> 01:00:58.473
There's nobody like you.

01:01:03.894 --> 01:01:06.189
All right, let's go.

01:01:06.272 --> 01:01:07.815
[Claire] Okay, okay.

01:01:15.573 --> 01:01:17.408
[air hissing]

01:01:19.494 --> 01:01:21.996
Good? Okay.

01:01:31.046 --> 01:01:32.173
Good.

01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:42.808
[Burstein] Keep your hands clear.
[Claire] Yeah.

01:01:42.892 --> 01:01:45.019
[Burstein] All right. Down.

01:01:51.151 --> 01:01:52.235
Hang in there.

01:01:53.653 --> 01:01:55.196
It's going to be okay.

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:57.282
[muffled screaming]

01:02:11.921 --> 01:02:13.964
How long do we keep him down?

01:02:14.715 --> 01:02:18.010
I don't know.
Just have to let the acid do its work.

01:02:21.597 --> 01:02:23.558
- Now?
- Not yet.

01:02:23.641 --> 01:02:25.100
[muffled screaming continues]

01:02:25.185 --> 01:02:27.102
- [beeping rapidly]
- [alarm blaring]

01:02:28.854 --> 01:02:30.690
What are you doing?

01:02:34.527 --> 01:02:35.903
He's not ready yet.

01:02:38.739 --> 01:02:40.491
All right. Hold on.

01:02:52.044 --> 01:02:53.296
Damn it.

01:02:55.089 --> 01:02:56.841
- Dip him again.
- What?

01:02:56.924 --> 01:02:59.260
Again! Again!

01:03:04.557 --> 01:03:05.683
One more.

01:03:06.434 --> 01:03:08.728
[muffled screaming]

01:03:17.653 --> 01:03:19.405
- [rapid beeping]
- [alarm blaring]

01:03:19.489 --> 01:03:21.907
- [Claire] We're losing him.
- It's not working.

01:03:21.991 --> 01:03:23.243
[muffled screaming]

01:03:23.326 --> 01:03:24.410
Why isn't it working?

01:03:24.494 --> 01:03:27.288
[Claire] We're losing him!
[Burstein] It's not working!

01:03:27.372 --> 01:03:29.081
[beeping continues]

01:03:29.164 --> 01:03:31.959
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

01:03:37.172 --> 01:03:38.173
- [flatlining]
- Shit!

01:03:38.258 --> 01:03:39.759
