1
00:01:06.416 --> 00:01:08.750
Let's do things differently this time.

2
00:01:09.525 --> 00:01:10.939
So differently.

3
00:01:13.488 --> 00:01:15.735
His name is Miles Morales.

4
00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:20.463
He was bitten by a radioactive spider,

5
00:01:21.843 --> 00:01:23.830
and he's not the only one.

6
00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:30.289
He hasn't always had it easy.

7
00:01:38.985 --> 00:01:40.685
And he's not the only one.

8
00:01:46.317 --> 00:01:47.650
And now he's on his own.

9
00:01:53.652 --> 00:01:55.298
And he's not the only one.

10
00:01:57.643 --> 00:01:58.923
You think you know the rest.

11
00:02:03.165 --> 00:02:04.131
You don't.

12
00:02:06.105 --> 00:02:08.392
I thought I knew the rest, but...

13
00:02:10.092 --> 00:02:10.885
I didn't.

14
00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:14.011
I didn't wanna hurt him.

15
00:02:16.602 --> 00:02:17.628
But I did.

16
00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:22.362
And he's not the only one.

17
00:02:32.158 --> 00:02:33.151
Hey!

18
00:02:33.176 --> 00:02:34.331
Stealth Leopard!

19
00:02:37.105 --> 00:02:37.785
Gwen!

20
00:02:42.012 --> 00:02:43.012
Is the song over?

21
00:02:43.678 --> 00:02:44.498
Seems over.

22
00:02:44.691 --> 00:02:46.477
-Are you okay?
-Dude, you don't hang out,

23
00:02:46.502 --> 00:02:49.735
-and you don't wanna talk...
-I didn't join a band so I could talk about my feelings!

24
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.620
-Well, I did.
-I joined it so I could hit my feelings with sticks!

25
00:02:53.481 --> 00:02:55.868
-Yo, if you don't tell someone what's going on...

26
00:02:55.893 --> 00:02:57.256
-you're gonna snap.
-I'm fine.

27
00:02:57.281 --> 00:02:59.834
-That's not how someone who's "fine" would say that.
-You say,

28
00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:01.075
"I'm great, thanks!

29
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.129
- How are you?"
- I'm great!

30
00:03:02.154 --> 00:03:03.489
-Thanks!
-Whoa.

31
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.157
How are you?

32
00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:06.398
Fine...?

33
00:03:07.265 --> 00:03:08.652
Gwen, come on.

34
00:03:08.677 --> 00:03:09.691
I don't get you, man.

35
00:03:09.716 --> 00:03:10.612
You're right!

36
00:03:11.804 --> 00:03:12.764
I play drums.

37
00:03:15.171 --> 00:03:17.091
I always wanted to be in a band.

38
00:03:18.966 --> 00:03:20.599
Guess I just never found the right one.

39
00:03:21.963 --> 00:03:23.437
In this line of work,

40
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.597
You always find out the solo act.

41
00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:30.526
But before Miles,

42
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:32.299
- What? How many of these did you take?
- ...there was Peter.

43
00:03:32.324 --> 00:03:33.978
I think they look great, I dunno.

44
00:03:34.003 --> 00:03:36.577
Is this...that...dangerous mask?

45
00:03:36.602 --> 00:03:38.477
I don't know, I...she seems like a good guy.

46
00:03:38.502 --> 00:03:40.239
Why wear a mask if you've got nothing to hide?

47
00:03:40.264 --> 00:03:42.266
Alright, no politics at the dinner table.

48
00:03:42.584 --> 00:03:44.104
Thank you, May.

49
00:03:45.026 --> 00:03:46.633
But they didn't really know me.

50
00:03:47.878 --> 00:03:50.079
And I didn't really know him, either.

51
00:03:51.326 --> 00:03:52.539
Touch him again, Ned.

52
00:03:52.564 --> 00:03:53.459
Gwen, it's okay.

53
00:03:55.556 --> 00:03:56.949
...Until it was too late.

54
00:04:03.987 --> 00:04:05.520
-Hey, Gwen!
-Hey!

55
00:04:07.535 --> 00:04:08.448
Peter?

56
00:04:31.648 --> 00:04:32.490
What?

57
00:04:32.515 --> 00:04:33.102
No...!

58
00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.192
No, no! No, no, no, no...what did you do?

59
00:04:38.085 --> 00:04:41.059
I just...wanted to be special.

60
00:04:41.855 --> 00:04:42.763
Like you...

61
00:04:43.504 --> 00:04:44.357
Gwen.

62
00:04:45.917 --> 00:04:46.616
Gwen...?

63
00:04:46.641 --> 00:04:47.017
Don't worry.

64
00:04:47.724 --> 00:04:49.071
Who's Gwen?

65
00:04:50.701 --> 00:04:52.728
Everything's gonna be okay.

66
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.967
- Don't...don't go!
- Everything's gonna be okay...

67
00:04:58.771 --> 00:04:59.638
Oh, Peter...

68
00:05:09.704 --> 00:05:10.605
Hey, hey!

69
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.105
Hey!

70
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.098
Peter...?

71
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.916
I never really made another friend, after that.

72
00:05:23.806 --> 00:05:24.819
Except one.

73
00:05:26.794 --> 00:05:28.274
But he's not here.

74
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.756
And there's no way to get there.

75
00:05:32.781 --> 00:05:34.765
Hush your mouths as captain George Stacy

76
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.585
leads the manhunt for Spiderwoman! Who is she?

77
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.251
And why won't she show her face?!

78
00:05:39.276 --> 00:05:42.859
- Peter Parker, an innocent young man...
-
I've known May and Ben Parker for twelve years.

79
00:05:42.884 --> 00:05:44.985
Peter Parker ate at my table.

80
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.818
He was my daughter's best friend.

81
00:05:47.843 --> 00:05:52.305
And I will not rest until I find this Spiderwoman.

82
00:06:04.588 --> 00:06:06.131
Oh! Hey, hey, hey, hey.

83
00:06:06.156 --> 00:06:06.896
How's the band?

84
00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:10.608
Uhh...uh, yeah, great. Uh, I quit, so...you know.

85
00:06:10.633 --> 00:06:11.485
Thumbs up.

86
00:06:14.933 --> 00:06:17.453
We, uh...we caught a break in the Spiderwoman case.

87
00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:18.853
Oh.

88
00:06:19.704 --> 00:06:20.884
That's...good.

89
00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:22.119
We're close.

90
00:06:22.144 --> 00:06:23.385
I'm telling ya, I can feel it.

91
00:06:24.828 --> 00:06:25.848
...Me, too.

92
00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:28.799
It'll be good for us.

93
00:06:28.824 --> 00:06:29.819
Don't be so sure.

94
00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:32.283
She killed your friend.

95
00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:33.110
You don't know that.

96
00:06:33.135 --> 00:06:34.496
What do you mean I don't know that? I do know that.

97
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:35.510
Y'know--I was there.

98
00:06:35.535 --> 00:06:37.825
-She ran from the scene...
-Maybe she didn't have a choice.

99
00:06:38.313 --> 00:06:39.726
I've got a job to do, Gwen.

100
00:06:39.751 --> 00:06:41.385
It won't bring him back!

101
00:06:46.019 --> 00:06:48.725
Uh...I don't wanna argue about this.

102
00:06:49.135 --> 00:06:50.115
Okay?

103
00:06:50.739 --> 00:06:51.926
Yeah. I can tell.

104
00:06:57.696 --> 00:06:58.562
Say, uh...

105
00:07:00.708 --> 00:07:02.762
Too punk rock to give your old man a hug-

106
00:07:17.652 --> 00:07:19.931
All units, possible superhuman event.

107
00:07:20.374 --> 00:07:22.720
-Guggenheim Musem, suspect is Adrian Toomes...
-Oh, hey. This could be it.

108
00:07:22.745 --> 00:07:24.321
-...also known as the Vulture.
-So...I, uh...

109
00:07:24.346 --> 00:07:25.228
I'll see you later?

110
00:07:26.032 --> 00:07:27.477
Cool.

111
00:07:28.178 --> 00:07:29.464
Um, I'll--I'll call.

112
00:07:29.489 --> 00:07:30.303
Local.

113
00:07:33.238 --> 00:07:35.907
49 currently on scene. It's a real mess down here.

114
00:07:35.932 --> 00:07:38.241
We're gonna need all the help we can get.

115
00:07:48.437 --> 00:07:50.284
-This is Captain Stacy. I'm 5 out.

116
00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:53.537
I need you to look alive, there's a good chance our girl shows up.

117
00:07:53.562 --> 00:07:55.624
Tonight's the night we catch Spiderwoman.

118
00:07:56.441 --> 00:07:57.394
Oh, great.

119
00:08:19.769 --> 00:08:20.349
Fury.

120
00:08:20.788 --> 00:08:23.708
Explain to me how a guy with a 40 foot wingspan

121
00:08:23.739 --> 00:08:26.040
just waltzed into the Guggenheim unnoticed?

122
00:08:26.065 --> 00:08:28.011
Hey, it's New York. Everyone's got their thing.

123
00:08:30.446 --> 00:08:31.952
You know what he wants?

124
00:08:31.977 --> 00:08:33.265
-Do you speak Italian?
-Uhhh...

125
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:34.520
I'm an Irish cop.

126
00:08:34.545 --> 00:08:36.227
Maybe you love pasta or something.

127
00:08:36.252 --> 00:08:37.867
Everybody, on my signal!

128
00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:39.947
Look out for signs of Spiderwoman!

129
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.255
Hey-mmph!

130
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.414
We found her.

131
00:08:45.333 --> 00:08:46.972
How's the manhunt for me going?

132
00:08:48.477 --> 00:08:49.125
Good to know!

133
00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:54.308
Vulture!

134
00:08:57.545 --> 00:08:59.198
Well, screaming their name usually works.

135
00:09:03.531 --> 00:09:05.238
I guess that worked...

136
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:09.463
I am the Vulture, the pinnacle of man's genius!

137
00:09:09.488 --> 00:09:12.324
You're not my Vulture. What are you, made of parchment?

138
00:09:12.349 --> 00:09:15.039
What cursed world have you brought me to?

139
00:09:16.307 --> 00:09:18.158
You're glitching, huh? Been there.

140
00:09:18.183 --> 00:09:19.418
Uh, where you from, bud?

141
00:09:19.443 --> 00:09:22.059
I am an artist! An engineer!

142
00:09:22.084 --> 00:09:24.338
Oh, great. A renaissance man.

143
00:09:24.363 --> 00:09:24.844
-Yes!

144
00:09:24.869 --> 00:09:25.611
Cool, let me guess.

145
00:09:26.706 --> 00:09:31.039
You were having an espresso in some
old-timey Leonardo DaVinci dimension,

146
00:09:31.064 --> 00:09:33.900
and suddenly a portal opens up,
and you wind up here,

147
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:37.310
Am I warm?

148
00:09:37.335 --> 00:09:38.883
Yes, that's pretty much it.

149
00:09:40.545 --> 00:09:41.378
Sidebar? Uh,

150
00:09:41.403 --> 00:09:44.861
maybe you could stop making a mess of the art museum for no reason?

151
00:09:44.886 --> 00:09:46.326
You call this art?

152
00:09:46.351 --> 00:09:47.799
We're talking about it, aren't we?

153
00:09:51.381 --> 00:09:52.410
Oh, that's cool.

154
00:09:53.293 --> 00:09:56.381
I mean, it's more of a meta-commentary on what we call art,

155
00:09:56.406 --> 00:09:57.190
but it's--it...

156
00:09:57.551 --> 00:09:58.844
...it's also...art?

157
00:10:01.052 --> 00:10:02.705
Oh, look! It's your cousin.

158
00:10:05.678 --> 00:10:08.472
I wouldn't play with fire, dude, you're kind of made of paper!

159
00:10:14.876 --> 00:10:15.789
Ohh, no.

160
00:10:45.837 --> 00:10:47.517
I'm sorry, who exactly are you supposed to be?

161
00:10:47.906 --> 00:10:48.699
That's classified.

162
00:10:49.526 --> 00:10:50.493
You're...the Blue Panther.

163
00:10:50.518 --> 00:10:51.022
No.

164
00:10:51.047 --> 00:10:51.642
The Caped "Blue-cader"?

165
00:10:51.667 --> 00:10:52.269
No, I'm...

166
00:10:52.294 --> 00:10:52.930
Dark Garfield?

167
00:10:52.955 --> 00:10:53.604
No. Stop.

168
00:10:53.629 --> 00:10:54.720
Macho Libre?

169
00:10:54.745 --> 00:10:55.907
I'm from another dimension.

170
00:10:55.932 --> 00:10:57.234
You are?

171
00:10:57.259 --> 00:10:58.319
Wooow...

172
00:10:58.344 --> 00:10:59.730
Actually, I'm not confused.

173
00:10:59.755 --> 00:11:01.992
My name...is Miguel O'Hara.

174
00:11:02.017 --> 00:11:05.524
I lead an elite strike force dedicated
to the security of the multiverse...

175
00:11:05.549 --> 00:11:06.417
Actually, forget it.

176
00:11:06.442 --> 00:11:08.891
Can you go to any dimension you want with that watch...

177
00:11:08.916 --> 00:11:09.609
-...thing?
-It's...

178
00:11:09.634 --> 00:11:10.722
-much cooler than a watch.

179
00:11:10.747 --> 00:11:12.396
Okay! Sensitive.

180
00:11:12.421 --> 00:11:15.217
Look, there is a big flying turkey from the renaissance

181
00:11:15.242 --> 00:11:17.563
I have to bring to justice, so if you don't mind.

182
00:11:17.588 --> 00:11:18.416
It's alright, kid.

183
00:11:18.441 --> 00:11:18.970
Wow.

184
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:20.762
I'll take it from here.

185
00:11:20.787 --> 00:11:22.555
Okay. Knock yourself out.

186
00:11:22.748 --> 00:11:24.001
Well...why are you saying it like that?

187
00:11:24.801 --> 00:11:25.781
You're not funny!

188
00:11:25.806 --> 00:11:27.617
Oh, I don't know...

189
00:11:30.696 --> 00:11:33.669
It's really fun cleaning up your shocking mess, by the way.

190
00:11:33.694 --> 00:11:34.333
What mess?

191
00:11:34.358 --> 00:11:35.665
Kingpin's collider!

192
00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:37.505
What are you guys talking about?

193
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:38.516
- None of your business!
- You shut up!

194
00:11:38.541 --> 00:11:38.862
Hey!

195
00:11:38.887 --> 00:11:39.395
Nosy.

196
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.055
We saved the multiverse!

197
00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.666
You left a hole wide enough for guys like him

198
00:11:43.691 --> 00:11:46.342
-to randomly get shot into the wrong dimension!

199
00:11:47.814 --> 00:11:50.547
Now I'm stuck putting everybody back where they belong

200
00:11:50.572 --> 00:11:52.710
before all of time and space collapses!

201
00:11:52.735 --> 00:11:57.743
Now, don't even get me started on Dr. Strange,
the little nerd back on Earth 1999999!

202
00:11:57.768 --> 00:11:58.868
Who's Doctor Strange?

203
00:11:58.893 --> 00:12:00.768
Sounds like he maybe shouldn't practice medicine.

204
00:12:01.329 --> 00:12:02.262
Sorry Captain,

205
00:12:02.287 --> 00:12:03.988
-can't talk right now! I'll be back!
-Wait! Hey!

206
00:12:07.471 --> 00:12:09.624
So, you want me to handle this one, or...?

207
00:12:14.916 --> 00:12:16.143
Huh. Okay.

208
00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:27.129
Ay, por Dios, he's got Hammerspace!

209
00:12:34.431 --> 00:12:36.237
Lyla? Can you please...

210
00:12:36.262 --> 00:12:36.694
y'know...

211
00:12:36.719 --> 00:12:38.335
Nah, you gotta say it, first.

212
00:12:39.346 --> 00:12:40.099
Call for backup.

213
00:12:40.124 --> 00:12:40.686
What?

214
00:12:40.711 --> 00:12:41.306
Call for backup.

215
00:12:41.331 --> 00:12:41.619
C'mooon.

216
00:12:41.644 --> 00:12:43.190
Please, just call for--

217
00:12:43.215 --> 00:12:43.919
Yeah I already called her.

218
00:12:44.511 --> 00:12:46.022
But I enjoyed thaaat~!

219
00:13:08.753 --> 00:13:09.546
Spiderwoman.

220
00:13:10.521 --> 00:13:11.194
Me, too.

221
00:13:12.558 --> 00:13:14.118
Uh--are you, uhh...

222
00:13:14.143 --> 00:13:15.614
Oh, this?

223
00:13:15.639 --> 00:13:17.255
We don't know the sex yet,

224
00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.507
my husband wants it to be a surprise.

225
00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:21.977
He's really corny. But so hot!

226
00:13:22.253 --> 00:13:23.353
Will you adopt me?

227
00:13:23.735 --> 00:13:24.075
What...?

228
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:24.448
What? What??

229
00:13:24.473 --> 00:13:25.549
Guys!

230
00:13:25.574 --> 00:13:28.661
Can we focus on the big fire-breathing
threat to time and space, please?!

231
00:13:28.686 --> 00:13:29.701
Yep! Yep, yep, yep, yep.

232
00:13:42.428 --> 00:13:43.315
What about her?

233
00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:43.989
No.

234
00:13:44.014 --> 00:13:44.689
We could use the help--

235
00:13:44.714 --> 00:13:45.133
No.

236
00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:47.167
Is it 'cuz she called you Dark Garfield?

237
00:13:47.192 --> 00:13:47.705
No!

238
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:48.581
Do you say anything but no-?

239
00:13:48.606 --> 00:13:49.334
No.

240
00:13:49.647 --> 00:13:49.995
Yes!

241
00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:50.708
Why not?

242
00:13:50.733 --> 00:13:51.753
You know why.

243
00:13:55.002 --> 00:13:56.228
Enough of this.

244
00:13:57.343 --> 00:14:01.356
Take a good look at my great fire from my backpack!

245
00:14:07.601 --> 00:14:08.681
Don't let him out!

246
00:14:11.115 --> 00:14:13.002
He'll disrupt the canon!

247
00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:28.390
- Go to the ground!
- Will you get out of here?!

248
00:14:28.415 --> 00:14:29.979
We have you surrounded!

249
00:14:30.004 --> 00:14:31.213
[Miguel] I'm a good guy!

250
00:14:31.238 --> 00:14:32.899
You don't look like a good guy!

251
00:14:32.924 --> 00:14:34.861
You're just gonna have to shut up and trust-

252
00:14:35.161 --> 00:14:35.875
No!

253
00:14:36.159 --> 00:14:39.505
Mayday! Mayday!

254
00:15:34.718 --> 00:15:36.981
Whoa!

255
00:15:37.457 --> 00:15:38.823
Yeah, I think it's a Banksy.

256
00:15:42.574 --> 00:15:43.741
That's what I was gonna do.

257
00:15:54.924 --> 00:15:55.884
Whew.

258
00:16:17.907 --> 00:16:18.769
Ugh!

259
00:16:18.919 --> 00:16:20.332
Hands in the air!

260
00:16:21.117 --> 00:16:22.791
Captain, come on.

261
00:16:22.816 --> 00:16:23.913
Suspect is armed.

262
00:16:23.938 --> 00:16:25.453
With what? I'm--I'm out of webs!

263
00:16:25.478 --> 00:16:26.431
Get down on the ground!

264
00:16:26.456 --> 00:16:28.232
Which is it? Hands in the air, or get down on the ground?

265
00:16:28.257 --> 00:16:29.169
You're under arrest.

266
00:16:29.194 --> 00:16:30.629
I just saved a bunch of people!

267
00:16:30.654 --> 00:16:31.708
For the murder of Peter Parker.

268
00:16:31.733 --> 00:16:34.065
-Captain, come on. I-
-You have the right to remain silent.

269
00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:35.133
-You don't understand!
-Anything you say...

270
00:16:41.221 --> 00:16:42.441
You don't understand.

271
00:17:13.375 --> 00:17:14.335
Dad...

272
00:17:17.072 --> 00:17:19.692
I...I've thought about...telling you.

273
00:17:20.236 --> 00:17:21.749
But you can see why I didn't want to.

274
00:17:21.774 --> 00:17:23.516
You can see why I didn't wanna tell you.

275
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:26.570
I didn't murder Peter.

276
00:17:26.595 --> 00:17:27.362
-I didn't--I...

277
00:17:27.689 --> 00:17:28.876
-I didn't know it was him!

278
00:17:28.901 --> 00:17:30.711
-I didn't have a choice!
-How long...

279
00:17:30.736 --> 00:17:32.336
have you been lying to me?

280
00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:35.873
Can you just--

281
00:17:35.898 --> 00:17:38.780
can you just not be a cop for a second, and be my dad here,

282
00:17:38.805 --> 00:17:39.773
and listen to me?

283
00:17:41.295 --> 00:17:43.075
Do you really think...

284
00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:44.141
I'm a murderer?

285
00:17:46.023 --> 00:17:48.516
You're in this to help people, right?

286
00:17:51.066 --> 00:17:51.739
Right?

287
00:17:52.808 --> 00:17:53.888
-So am I!

288
00:17:55.653 --> 00:17:57.920
And the way to help right now is to listen to me!

289
00:17:58.834 --> 00:17:59.807
-Please, Dad.

290
00:18:01.781 --> 00:18:03.014
You're all I have left.

291
00:18:07.199 --> 00:18:09.532
You have a right to remain silent.

292
00:18:09.557 --> 00:18:11.865
-Uhh, what?
-Anything you say can and will be used

293
00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:15.039
-Dad, are you really this afraid of me?!
-against you in a court of law. You have a right to an attorney...

294
00:18:15.064 --> 00:18:15.590
No! Stop!

295
00:18:15.615 --> 00:18:16.826
Don't get any closer!

296
00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.687
-Dad!
- Hey, hey, hey. C'mon.

297
00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:25.587
Just breathe.

298
00:18:26.159 --> 00:18:27.260
We got you.

299
00:18:27.285 --> 00:18:28.092
Right, Miguel?

300
00:18:30.996 --> 00:18:31.509
Lyla.

301
00:18:32.121 --> 00:18:33.214
Scan this mess.

302
00:18:35.665 --> 00:18:36.645
No further anomalies.

303
00:18:37.238 --> 00:18:39.018
Canon remains intact.

304
00:18:42.659 --> 00:18:44.325
We can't just leave her here.

305
00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:46.079
She's doing this on her own.

306
00:18:56.671 --> 00:18:57.994
I don't know how to fix this.

307
00:19:06.086 --> 00:19:06.753
Yeah.

308
00:19:07.745 --> 00:19:08.425
Well...

309
00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:10.930
Join the club.

310
00:20:16.377 --> 00:20:17.727
I know he's just a sophomore,

311
00:20:17.752 --> 00:20:20.930
but we wanna get a jump on the college conversation, so...

312
00:20:20.955 --> 00:20:22.787
I'm sure he's gonna be...

313
00:20:23.321 --> 00:20:24.488
here. Any minute.

314
00:20:24.513 --> 00:20:26.988
He's very serious about his future.

315
00:20:29.506 --> 00:20:30.072
Uhh...

316
00:20:43.777 --> 00:20:45.397
Excuse me, do you have, uhh...

317
00:20:45.422 --> 00:20:46.524
...an ATM machine?

318
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:47.689
Yeah, right around here, in the back.

319
00:20:47.714 --> 00:20:49.251
-Preferrably not chained to the wall?
-What?

320
00:20:49.276 --> 00:20:50.026
Uh, nothing!

321
00:20:50.744 --> 00:20:52.310
This should be simple enough.

322
00:20:53.244 --> 00:20:54.410
Just make a hole...

323
00:20:55.916 --> 00:20:56.796
grab the money.

324
00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:02.377
Oh! That's not right.

325
00:21:03.263 --> 00:21:04.590
Just get the-...ugh...

326
00:21:05.557 --> 00:21:06.843
[awkwardly] Give me your money.

327
00:21:06.868 --> 00:21:08.309
Where are you, money? Where are you?

328
00:21:09.339 --> 00:21:10.293
Oh...

329
00:21:13.835 --> 00:21:14.370
Whoa!

330
00:21:14.984 --> 00:21:16.810
-Hey, who left this ATM on the sidewalk?!
-[Spot] Augh!

331
00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.733
Yo, what you doing back there, man?

332
00:21:21.758 --> 00:21:22.236
-Nothing!

333
00:21:22.261 --> 00:21:24.551
Nothing, everything is--everything's cool, man!

334
00:21:24.576 --> 00:21:25.172
All good!

335
00:21:25.197 --> 00:21:26.677
-Just forgot my pin number!
-Get your butt out of here!

336
00:21:26.702 --> 00:21:27.716
-Ahh! No!
-Get your butt out of here!

337
00:21:27.741 --> 00:21:29.692
Sir, please! Just let me rob you!

338
00:21:29.717 --> 00:21:32.996
- I'm going to rob your face!
- There's no reason to bring wood into this!

339
00:21:33.021 --> 00:21:34.645
I've never robbed anybody in my life,

340
00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:36.005
please don't make this a bad experience for me!

341
00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.196
Bad experience?

342
00:21:37.221 --> 00:21:38.643
-I'm trying to run a business, here!

343
00:21:38.668 --> 00:21:39.311
I have this whole-

344
00:21:40.064 --> 00:21:41.118
Oh, wow. Is this curry powder?

345
00:21:41.143 --> 00:21:42.208
We'll say I'm a scientist.

346
00:21:42.233 --> 00:21:43.120
I was. I am!

347
00:21:43.145 --> 00:21:43.713
I... anyway.

348
00:21:43.738 --> 00:21:45.126
You heard of Alchemax? I used to-

349
00:21:45.151 --> 00:21:46.494
I used to work there.

350
00:21:46.519 --> 00:21:49.408
I was actually considered handsome, by scientist standards.

351
00:21:49.433 --> 00:21:51.161
But I had a little accident...!

352
00:21:55.066 --> 00:21:55.533
Hey!

353
00:21:55.558 --> 00:21:56.461
Oof!

354
00:21:56.672 --> 00:21:57.698
I'm so sorry!

355
00:21:57.723 --> 00:21:59.072
First of all, I'm not even robbing you,

356
00:21:59.097 --> 00:22:01.309
I mean, this ATM machine doesn't even belong to you, right?

357
00:22:01.334 --> 00:22:02.170
This belongs to the bank!

358
00:22:02.195 --> 00:22:04.741
- They're the real criminals!
- You're the real criminal! You're robbing me!

359
00:22:04.766 --> 00:22:07.182
Y'know, I can't really get a job anywhere anymore,

360
00:22:07.207 --> 00:22:09.205
being like this, so I've turned to a life of crime,

361
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:11.545
- I'm having trouble finding...ah!
- Why do people say "ATM machine"?

362
00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:12.368
Who said that?

363
00:22:12.393 --> 00:22:14.395
The M stands for "machines".

364
00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:15.745
Spider--aahh!

365
00:22:19.234 --> 00:22:21.833
Hey, Lenny.
How much do I owe you for this beef patty, man?

366
00:22:21.858 --> 00:22:25.120
Spider, if you catch him, it's on the house, brother.

367
00:22:25.145 --> 00:22:25.978
Oww!

368
00:22:26.003 --> 00:22:27.490
Oh! Spiderman. Wow.

369
00:22:27.515 --> 00:22:28.229
Ahh!

370
00:22:28.254 --> 00:22:29.223
This is real!

371
00:22:29.248 --> 00:22:32.327
So, are you like, a cow, or a dalmation?

372
00:22:32.352 --> 00:22:33.206
I am...

373
00:22:35.545 --> 00:22:36.160
The Spot.

374
00:22:37.085 --> 00:22:38.680
We meet again, Spiderman.

375
00:22:41.759 --> 00:22:43.465
-Oh, that's funny to you?
-Of course not.

376
00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:44.205
No.

377
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:45.206
So, is that a costume?

378
00:22:45.231 --> 00:22:47.402
Unfortunately for both of us, this is skin.

379
00:22:47.427 --> 00:22:48.362
Oh, dang.

380
00:22:48.387 --> 00:22:49.738
You see...

381
00:22:50.188 --> 00:22:51.242
I'm from your past.

382
00:22:51.868 --> 00:22:52.757
One year ago...

383
00:22:52.782 --> 00:22:53.611
Hold up.

384
00:22:53.636 --> 00:22:54.449
Oh, come on!

385
00:22:54.474 --> 00:22:55.343
Uh oh.

386
00:22:55.368 --> 00:22:57.019
- Well, this has been fun, um...
- Who are you talking to?

387
00:22:57.044 --> 00:22:59.474
-But I really gotta wrap this up.
- No, no, no! No, go ahead, take your call.

388
00:23:01.654 --> 00:23:04.781
This job is so dumb sometimes!

389
00:23:07.818 --> 00:23:09.065
Maybe just pay me now.

390
00:23:09.214 --> 00:23:11.175
Okay, let's do this one last time.

391
00:23:12.218 --> 00:23:14.118
My name is Miles Morales.

392
00:23:14.506 --> 00:23:16.379
I was bitten by a radioactive spider,

393
00:23:16.963 --> 00:23:18.750
and for the last year and four months,

394
00:23:19.433 --> 00:23:22.780
I've been Brooklyn's one and only Spiderman.

395
00:23:22.805 --> 00:23:25.242
And things are going great.

396
00:23:25.535 --> 00:23:26.922
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

397
00:23:26.947 --> 00:23:28.659
-Whoo!
-You could hurt somebody!

398
00:23:31.046 --> 00:23:32.852
Catching all sorts of bad guys,

399
00:23:35.527 --> 00:23:38.522
Can't you just act like a regular supervillain so I can catch you?

400
00:23:39.914 --> 00:23:41.307
I designed my new suit,

401
00:23:41.332 --> 00:23:43.793
with some fly ambience down the side.

402
00:23:43.818 --> 00:23:45.439
Aunt May moved to Florida,

403
00:23:45.464 --> 00:23:46.203
Done.

404
00:23:46.228 --> 00:23:47.817
I guest hosted Jeopardy.

405
00:23:48.183 --> 00:23:49.823
Endorsed baby powder,

406
00:23:50.219 --> 00:23:52.567
apologized for endorsing baby powder,

407
00:23:52.881 --> 00:23:54.514
my mustache came in,

408
00:23:54.784 --> 00:23:56.197
[deep voice] Mustache.

409
00:23:56.222 --> 00:23:58.257
...and out.

410
00:23:59.513 --> 00:24:01.895
Been developing a new twist on my venom thing.

411
00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:02.813
Zap!

412
00:24:03.793 --> 00:24:04.853
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

413
00:24:07.406 --> 00:24:07.853
Sorry!

414
00:24:07.878 --> 00:24:11.535
How much longer can I keep lying about who really I am?

415
00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:13.169
I hear that new Spiderman is Puerto Rican.

416
00:24:13.194 --> 00:24:14.750
Nahh, he...

417
00:24:14.775 --> 00:24:16.398
he seems more Dominican to me.

418
00:24:16.423 --> 00:24:19.684
-I mean, would they get it if I told them?

419
00:24:19.709 --> 00:24:21.611
We love you and accept you,

420
00:24:21.636 --> 00:24:24.880
even though you have been lying to us for a year!

421
00:24:26.341 --> 00:24:27.774
Maybe in some other universe.

422
00:24:28.502 --> 00:24:30.149
Sometimes I just...

423
00:24:30.174 --> 00:24:31.742
wish I wasn't the only one.

424
00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.400
I don't dwell on it.

425
00:24:41.735 --> 00:24:43.522
I miss my uncle, sometimes.

426
00:24:44.694 --> 00:24:46.807
Miles, I see exactly what you're doing here.

427
00:24:47.972 --> 00:24:50.452
Even though he...turned out to be the Prowler.

428
00:24:52.897 --> 00:24:54.577
I try to do what he told me.

429
00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:57.417
Just keep going.

430
00:24:58.067 --> 00:24:59.414
You're looking at your texts?

431
00:24:59.439 --> 00:25:01.551
-You understand this is the fight of our lives, right?
-Sorry, sorry.

432
00:25:01.576 --> 00:25:02.665
-Just--just a second.
-Oh, okay.

433
00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:04.442
No, no, no. No, go ahead. Take one call.

434
00:25:04.467 --> 00:25:07.101
-You turn off your phone at a movie theater,
but you don't turn it off when you're fighting me? -One sec.

435
00:25:07.672 --> 00:25:08.658
Ah! "In a minute".

436
00:25:08.683 --> 00:25:10.742
Ahh, he wrote it all as one word.

437
00:25:10.767 --> 00:25:12.644
That's cute, right? Youth.

438
00:25:16.505 --> 00:25:18.338
Ohhh, my nose!

439
00:25:18.365 --> 00:25:19.374
Sorry, I just-

440
00:25:19.399 --> 00:25:20.311
I really gotta be somewhere-

441
00:25:20.336 --> 00:25:21.028
Sike.

442
00:25:23.636 --> 00:25:25.529
Heh. There's bubbles now. Hold on.

443
00:25:25.554 --> 00:25:26.200
Whoa!

444
00:25:27.014 --> 00:25:28.996
I think this is going great!

445
00:25:29.966 --> 00:25:31.660
Still bubbles on here.

446
00:25:32.899 --> 00:25:34.512
You know, I think it's probably okay.

447
00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:38.587
We're figuring it out! We're finding our rhythm!

448
00:25:41.076 --> 00:25:44.030
I've been waiting for this moment for a really long time, so...

449
00:25:45.093 --> 00:25:46.589
Hey, where'd the goose come from?

450
00:25:47.532 --> 00:25:48.150
-Whoa!

451
00:25:48.175 --> 00:25:50.104
I don't think I want this costume anymore.

452
00:25:50.129 --> 00:25:53.471
Almost there, Mami...smiley face...

453
00:25:53.496 --> 00:25:55.457
Great. Is this your goose?

454
00:25:55.492 --> 00:25:57.145
Get it off me, get it off me, get it--

455
00:25:59.441 --> 00:26:00.194
Ow!

456
00:26:01.681 --> 00:26:02.821
At the end of the day,

457
00:26:04.444 --> 00:26:05.964
I got you right where I-

458
00:26:05.989 --> 00:26:06.547
ow!

459
00:26:08.252 --> 00:26:09.484
-I'm Spiderman.

460
00:26:09.509 --> 00:26:12.291
-No one can take that away from me.
-Unbelievable.

461
00:26:12.316 --> 00:26:13.690
Come back here, nemesis!

462
00:26:13.715 --> 00:26:14.987
Don't escape!

463
00:26:15.012 --> 00:26:17.100
Your costume's too tight in the back, by the way!

464
00:26:25.962 --> 00:26:26.948
Yo, what's up, man?

465
00:26:26.973 --> 00:26:28.224
Umm, writing an essay.

466
00:26:28.249 --> 00:26:31.362
There's a bad guy on the roof of the Peterson building. Can you call the police?

467
00:26:31.387 --> 00:26:33.841
-Tell them to pick him up?
-I dunno. Sounds like a slippery slope.

468
00:26:33.866 --> 00:26:34.655
Just this one time?

469
00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:38.327
It starts with one call, then it's walkie talkies and synchronized watches...

470
00:26:38.352 --> 00:26:39.868
in a month, it'll be a spider signal...

471
00:26:39.893 --> 00:26:41.754
I'm not your guy in the chair.

472
00:26:41.779 --> 00:26:43.215
Are those my Jordans?

473
00:26:44.004 --> 00:26:45.651
I can't help it if we're the same size.

474
00:26:57.202 --> 00:27:00.509
You see, every person is a universe.

475
00:27:00.534 --> 00:27:04.010
And my job is to capture your person's universe

476
00:27:04.035 --> 00:27:05.750
on this piece of paper.

477
00:27:07.287 --> 00:27:08.007
That's blank.

478
00:27:08.032 --> 00:27:08.791
Exactly.

479
00:27:09.343 --> 00:27:12.321
I have no idea who this kid is.

480
00:27:12.346 --> 00:27:14.196
I don't know if he knows.

481
00:27:14.221 --> 00:27:18.041
And he's gotta decide if he's
gonna commit himself to his future,

482
00:27:18.066 --> 00:27:21.214
...or whatever he's doing instead of being here.

483
00:27:21.239 --> 00:27:23.173
Can't have your cake and eat it, too.

484
00:27:23.198 --> 00:27:24.488
Unless you bake two cakes!

485
00:27:24.513 --> 00:27:25.262
Rio: Miles?
Jeff: Miles!

486
00:27:25.287 --> 00:27:26.754
Interest in comedy.

487
00:27:26.779 --> 00:27:27.357
How's this going?

488
00:27:27.382 --> 00:27:29.258
-Now, son, what have we always said?
-College! Woo-woo!

489
00:27:29.283 --> 00:27:31.572
On time means five minutes early.

490
00:27:31.597 --> 00:27:33.291
I know! I know, I know, I know. Look.

491
00:27:33.316 --> 00:27:36.346
I gotta get back to being a great student, so can we make this quick?

492
00:27:39.885 --> 00:27:40.711
Okay.

493
00:27:41.137 --> 00:27:43.030
Miles' grades are pretty good.

494
00:27:43.055 --> 00:27:44.762
A in AP physics,

495
00:27:44.787 --> 00:27:46.068
That's my little man!

496
00:27:46.093 --> 00:27:48.059
and AP studio art,

497
00:27:48.084 --> 00:27:49.625
He takes after his uncle.

498
00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:50.919
-A- in English,

499
00:27:50.944 --> 00:27:51.620
He's a tough grader.

500
00:27:51.645 --> 00:27:53.152
And a B in Spanish.

501
00:27:53.177 --> 00:27:54.634
-What?!
-Whoo, okay.

502
00:27:54.659 --> 00:27:56.534
-Miles. [Speaking Spanish]
-Are you trying to kill your mother?!

503
00:27:56.559 --> 00:27:57.729
Calmate, Mami.

504
00:27:57.754 --> 00:27:59.056
Eso no es my fault!

505
00:27:59.081 --> 00:28:00.847
"My fault"?

506
00:28:00.872 --> 00:28:02.071
Spanglish!

507
00:28:02.096 --> 00:28:03.590
Mom, I just missed a few classes!

508
00:28:03.615 --> 00:28:05.728
Oh, just a few classes. Well, what's "a few"?

509
00:28:05.753 --> 00:28:07.392
I mean, you know, like...

510
00:28:08.089 --> 00:28:08.636
...five?

511
00:28:08.661 --> 00:28:09.531
Five?!

512
00:28:09.894 --> 00:28:10.760
Actually, six.

513
00:28:10.785 --> 00:28:11.430
You're dead.

514
00:28:11.455 --> 00:28:12.204
Mom.

515
00:28:12.229 --> 00:28:13.813
- He takes after his uncle.
- Wait, wait, wait. But...

516
00:28:13.838 --> 00:28:14.390
But I...

517
00:28:14.415 --> 00:28:15.964
-I just have a lot going on.
-Alright.

518
00:28:15.989 --> 00:28:17.735
We can still salvage this.

519
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:18.551
I'm sorry, "salvage"?

520
00:28:18.576 --> 00:28:20.784
Miles has a great story to tell.

521
00:28:20.809 --> 00:28:23.167
Having a story at all seems gross.

522
00:28:23.192 --> 00:28:25.521
Your name is Miles Morales.

523
00:28:25.546 --> 00:28:26.015
Correct.

524
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:29.069
You grew up in a struggling immigrant family.

525
00:28:29.094 --> 00:28:31.610
I'm from Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico's part of America...

526
00:28:31.635 --> 00:28:34.324
We own a fort in Brooklyn. I-I don't know about struggling...

527
00:28:34.349 --> 00:28:36.422
It doesn't matter. You're all struggling.

528
00:28:36.447 --> 00:28:37.281
I'll be captain next week.

529
00:28:37.306 --> 00:28:41.180
And now, his dream is to attend the top physics program in the nation!

530
00:28:41.205 --> 00:28:42.762
Whatever it takes, we'll do it!

531
00:28:42.787 --> 00:28:45.149
At Princeton University.

532
00:28:45.895 --> 00:28:47.122
In New Jersey?!

533
00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:50.050
No, no, no no no no! That's too far!

534
00:28:50.075 --> 00:28:52.666
New Jersey's too far from New York?!

535
00:28:52.691 --> 00:28:54.988
There's great schools in Brooklyn!

536
00:28:55.363 --> 00:28:57.910
Princeton has the best quantum researchers in the country!

537
00:28:57.935 --> 00:29:01.690
- Quantum research...mm-hmm.
- They're moving electrons across dimensional thresholds!

538
00:29:01.715 --> 00:29:02.377
...Electrons, uh-huh.

539
00:29:02.402 --> 00:29:04.017
I mean, they're studying dark matter!

540
00:29:04.042 --> 00:29:05.817
Yeah, I don't know what any of that means.

541
00:29:05.842 --> 00:29:09.156
I could help figure out how to travel to other dimensions.

542
00:29:09.181 --> 00:29:09.951
Yeah, okay.

543
00:29:09.976 --> 00:29:12.211
Oh, yeah. That sounds like a really good fake job.

544
00:29:12.236 --> 00:29:14.084
Dad. When you were my age,

545
00:29:14.109 --> 00:29:17.468
you followed your dream, and went out on your own,

546
00:29:17.493 --> 00:29:19.260
to start a business with Uncle Aaron.

547
00:29:19.285 --> 00:29:20.941
-Right?
-That's...different.

548
00:29:20.966 --> 00:29:23.081
We used to...see, when you were born,

549
00:29:23.106 --> 00:29:24.901
plus your mom used to...

550
00:29:25.964 --> 00:29:27.564
Look, life is a journey.

551
00:29:27.589 --> 00:29:31.108
You all got me into this school 'cuz you thought I could do something special.

552
00:29:32.407 --> 00:29:34.160
And now, I think so, too.

553
00:29:34.536 --> 00:29:36.890
And the special thing I wanna do is this.

554
00:29:37.898 --> 00:29:42.118
There are people out there who can literally teach me the things I wanna learn.

555
00:29:42.819 --> 00:29:44.553
But they aren't all in Brooklyn.

556
00:29:53.748 --> 00:29:55.168
That's your story!

557
00:29:55.722 --> 00:29:58.568
- Now, just stick to the script.
- Miles, you okay?

558
00:30:04.306 --> 00:30:05.793
- Ooh, I gotta go.
- You...

559
00:30:05.818 --> 00:30:07.178
You guys just keep talking!

560
00:30:07.203 --> 00:30:08.732
- This is all great stuff!
- Miles, wait!

561
00:30:08.757 --> 00:30:10.079
Did you order the cake for tonight?

562
00:30:10.104 --> 00:30:11.606
Yeah, totally! I'm--you know, call me! Uhh-

563
00:30:11.631 --> 00:30:13.036
I gotta go. Alright? Uhh--bye!

564
00:30:14.011 --> 00:30:15.018
This kid.

565
00:30:15.043 --> 00:30:16.377
I swear. What are we gonna do with him?

566
00:30:16.402 --> 00:30:17.426
All units,

567
00:30:17.451 --> 00:30:18.981
-supervillain event over on...
-I-I gotta go.

568
00:30:19.006 --> 00:30:19.555
What?!

569
00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:20.404
You're gonna leave, too-?

570
00:30:20.429 --> 00:30:21.584
You leave--everybody leaves.

571
00:30:21.609 --> 00:30:22.850
Why am I here?

572
00:30:22.875 --> 00:30:24.222
- Why am I here? Why am I still here?
- I know. I'm so sorry.

573
00:30:24.247 --> 00:30:25.337
But we'll figure it out.

574
00:30:26.337 --> 00:30:27.057
Together.

575
00:30:29.003 --> 00:30:29.723
Wow.

576
00:30:30.045 --> 00:30:32.190
Excuse me. I-I'm so sorry.

577
00:30:32.215 --> 00:30:33.531
He's lying to you.

578
00:30:33.556 --> 00:30:34.258
Jeff?

579
00:30:34.283 --> 00:30:35.151
Your son.

580
00:30:35.538 --> 00:30:38.332
He's lying. And I think you know it.

581
00:30:40.587 --> 00:30:41.802
How's your essay?

582
00:30:41.827 --> 00:30:42.658
Marinating.

583
00:30:42.683 --> 00:30:44.143
This is part of my process.

584
00:30:44.168 --> 00:30:45.208
Oh. Oh, really?

585
00:30:45.233 --> 00:30:46.738
I think your guy got away.

586
00:30:46.763 --> 00:30:47.528
Thanks. I'm on it.

587
00:30:47.553 --> 00:30:48.969
Yeah, you seem really stressed.

588
00:30:48.994 --> 00:30:49.475
I agree!

589
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.634
- You're stretched too thin. I've been worried-
- Yeah, alright. Thanks for the tip!

590
00:30:51.659 --> 00:30:52.324
C'mere!

591
00:30:52.349 --> 00:30:53.726
-That was bad.
- I know.

592
00:30:53.751 --> 00:30:55.340
What is really going on with this kid?

593
00:30:55.365 --> 00:30:56.189
I don't know!

594
00:30:56.214 --> 00:30:57.090
Hey!

595
00:30:57.722 --> 00:30:59.236
-Spiderman!
-Officer Morales!

596
00:30:59.261 --> 00:31:00.368
I mean, umm...

597
00:31:00.393 --> 00:31:01.408
Officer Morales.

598
00:31:01.433 --> 00:31:02.538
This is not what it looks like.

599
00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:04.357
Hey! Hey!

600
00:31:04.382 --> 00:31:06.715
- Officer...!
- My kid goes here, man!

601
00:31:07.562 --> 00:31:08.028
Yo!

602
00:31:08.182 --> 00:31:09.396
I'm on the PTA!

603
00:31:09.421 --> 00:31:11.486
You know how many lemon bars I gotta bake for that?

604
00:31:11.511 --> 00:31:13.017
[Spot] Who laughs in the middle of a fight?

605
00:31:13.042 --> 00:31:13.717
I did not!

606
00:31:13.742 --> 00:31:16.718
- It was...
- Are you serious?!
- It was inconsiderate and super rude!

607
00:31:16.743 --> 00:31:17.762
...And a little cocky--oof!

608
00:31:18.034 --> 00:31:20.534
Yeah, you got me agreeing with the bad guy right now.

609
00:31:20.559 --> 00:31:23.196
Bad guy? He's barely a villain of the week!

610
00:31:23.221 --> 00:31:24.102
What'd you call me?

611
00:31:24.127 --> 00:31:26.023
-You realize I'm right here.
-C'mon, man!
-Everything-

612
00:31:27.663 --> 00:31:28.883
...is under control!

613
00:31:35.159 --> 00:31:36.586
Of course we'd end up back here.

614
00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.907
-Well, you know what? You are just like my son!

615
00:31:38.932 --> 00:31:42.131
-I am? I-- That's so silly! I--what?

616
00:31:42.156 --> 00:31:44.456
-Imagine that.
-Back...where it all...

617
00:31:44.481 --> 00:31:45.560
-started!
-Watch out!

618
00:31:48.022 --> 00:31:50.122
The crucible of our connection!

619
00:31:51.158 --> 00:31:53.397
Hey, don't try to wow me with big words.

620
00:31:53.422 --> 00:31:55.194
-I do the crossword every day.

621
00:32:00.862 --> 00:32:03.769
- Is it all coming back to you?
- What are you talking about?

622
00:32:03.794 --> 00:32:05.326
The creation event!

623
00:32:06.011 --> 00:32:06.697
What?

624
00:32:08.749 --> 00:32:09.356
Ah!

625
00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:10.974
Yeah?

626
00:32:10.999 --> 00:32:12.059
Hey, baby. We got cut off.

627
00:32:13.495 --> 00:32:15.937
Nothing is more important than management.

628
00:32:20.096 --> 00:32:21.569
Yeah, I'm kinda in the middle of something.

629
00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:24.653
Destiny brought us here!

630
00:32:24.678 --> 00:32:26.325
You see now, don't you?

631
00:32:26.622 --> 00:32:27.756
I-I really don't.

632
00:32:27.781 --> 00:32:29.491
I am your nemesis.

633
00:32:29.516 --> 00:32:31.228
You're not my nemesis.

634
00:32:31.253 --> 00:32:32.457
You missed!

635
00:32:32.482 --> 00:32:34.328
-Can't contain the Spot--augh!

636
00:32:34.734 --> 00:32:37.282
You really don't remember what you did to me?

637
00:32:37.728 --> 00:32:38.642
-What I did for you?

638
00:32:38.667 --> 00:32:39.573
Uhhh...

639
00:32:39.598 --> 00:32:40.084
No.

640
00:32:40.109 --> 00:32:41.506
I worked at Alchemax.

641
00:32:41.531 --> 00:32:44.055
I ran a test on this collider

642
00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:46.650
that brought a spider here from another dimension.

643
00:32:47.534 --> 00:32:49.246
- 42.
- Its home dimension...

644
00:32:49.754 --> 00:32:50.720
It escaped.

645
00:32:51.597 --> 00:32:52.857
And it bit you.

646
00:32:53.685 --> 00:32:56.565
My spider made you Spiderman!

647
00:32:57.289 --> 00:32:57.891
What?

648
00:32:57.916 --> 00:32:59.409
You ran through the cafeteria.

649
00:32:59.434 --> 00:33:00.046
He took a bagel!

650
00:33:00.071 --> 00:33:01.399
You hit me with a bagel!

651
00:33:03.014 --> 00:33:05.723
I've hit a lot of different villains with a lot of different food!

652
00:33:05.748 --> 00:33:08.997
You make your flippy, little sassy jokes,

653
00:33:09.022 --> 00:33:10.372
and everyone loves them.

654
00:33:10.862 --> 00:33:12.848
But no one knows what it feels like...

655
00:33:13.662 --> 00:33:15.209
to be on the other side of them.

656
00:33:15.234 --> 00:33:16.813
I'm just trying to lighten the mood, y'know...?

657
00:33:16.838 --> 00:33:17.939
I created you!

658
00:33:18.479 --> 00:33:20.005
And you created me.

659
00:33:20.625 --> 00:33:21.739
Spiderman, why did you create that guy?

660
00:33:21.764 --> 00:33:22.730
I-I didn't!

661
00:33:22.755 --> 00:33:23.875
He's talking crazy!

662
00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:26.601
I was in this collider room when you blew it up!

663
00:33:35.545 --> 00:33:36.534
-Because of you,

664
00:33:37.519 --> 00:33:39.315
I lost my job,

665
00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:40.326
my life...

666
00:33:40.913 --> 00:33:42.226
my face!

667
00:33:42.251 --> 00:33:44.468
My family won't even look at me!

668
00:33:44.493 --> 00:33:46.200
I made you into a hero!

669
00:33:46.537 --> 00:33:47.684
You made me into this!

670
00:33:48.272 --> 00:33:49.323
Look at me!

671
00:33:49.348 --> 00:33:51.722
You did this to me!

672
00:33:51.747 --> 00:33:52.960
Look at me!

673
00:33:52.985 --> 00:33:54.647
I'll make you respect me!

674
00:33:54.672 --> 00:33:56.289
Yaah! Ahh! Ow!

675
00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.213
I am your...

676
00:33:59.238 --> 00:34:00.956
nemesis...!

677
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.982
Well, what...

678
00:34:06.007 --> 00:34:06.723
where'd he go?

679
00:34:06.748 --> 00:34:09.173
He...kicked his own butt.

680
00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.773
You know we're supposed to catch 'em, the bad guys. Right?

681
00:34:12.798 --> 00:34:14.282
I always do!

682
00:34:15.084 --> 00:34:16.044
...Usually.

683
00:34:16.273 --> 00:34:18.067
Gutierrez, get the crane, man!

684
00:34:18.092 --> 00:34:21.330
- Yes, sir!
- Ohh, this here is why nobody likes us, man.

685
00:34:21.355 --> 00:34:22.257
Us...?

686
00:34:22.282 --> 00:34:24.362
I am trying to do right out here.

687
00:34:24.387 --> 00:34:25.700
I mean...I'm trying, too-!

688
00:34:25.725 --> 00:34:28.125
- And you need to be a better role model.
- I'm a great role model!

689
00:34:32.573 --> 00:34:33.533
Hey, Gutierrez.

690
00:34:34.006 --> 00:34:35.233
You can cancel the crane.

691
00:34:37.831 --> 00:34:40.305
I swear...

692
00:34:40.568 --> 00:34:42.008
Uhhh...

693
00:34:42.033 --> 00:34:44.097
Do you wanna talk about it...?

694
00:34:44.121 --> 00:34:45.195
Are you crazy?!

695
00:34:45.541 --> 00:34:48.661
Well, men of your generation ignore their mental health too much.

696
00:34:50.246 --> 00:34:52.264
What am I--what am I even doing?

697
00:34:52.289 --> 00:34:54.775
'Cuz no matter what I do, someone always thinks I'm blowing it.

698
00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:58.076
I know the feeling.

699
00:35:00.436 --> 00:35:03.190
So...your son!

700
00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:04.704
How's he doing?

701
00:35:04.729 --> 00:35:07.717
You think he's gonna figure it all out?

702
00:35:08.024 --> 00:35:09.079
Honestly?

703
00:35:09.104 --> 00:35:10.337
Yeah...

704
00:35:10.362 --> 00:35:11.317
He's a good kid...

705
00:35:11.342 --> 00:35:11.810
Yeah?

706
00:35:11.835 --> 00:35:14.601
Y'know, it's scary. He says these things that are so smart,

707
00:35:14.626 --> 00:35:16.494
-Cool! Well, I should probably-

708
00:35:16.519 --> 00:35:19.690
...and he does these things that are so stupid.

709
00:35:20.776 --> 00:35:22.649
I just don't want him to mess it up.

710
00:35:23.616 --> 00:35:25.130
Maybe get off the kid's ass.

711
00:35:25.155 --> 00:35:25.553
I'm sorry, what?

712
00:35:25.578 --> 00:35:27.685
What? What--I...I don't know!

713
00:35:28.681 --> 00:35:31.141
And I hate that he's not being honest with me!

714
00:35:31.531 --> 00:35:33.078
Maybe he's scared to talk to you.

715
00:35:33.103 --> 00:35:35.410
Why would anyone be scared to talk to me?!

716
00:35:35.711 --> 00:35:37.557
Uhh...I don't--I don't know.

717
00:35:37.582 --> 00:35:38.642
It's just...

718
00:35:39.304 --> 00:35:41.097
you're getting pretty good at being a parent, you think...

719
00:35:41.532 --> 00:35:42.532
you got it lit.

720
00:35:43.263 --> 00:35:44.483
And then they go and grow up.

721
00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:49.716
I just don't wanna lose him. Y'know?

722
00:35:57.261 --> 00:35:58.601
Well...

723
00:35:58.626 --> 00:36:01.885
as an objective observer with no skin in the game,

724
00:36:02.836 --> 00:36:03.782
I say...

725
00:36:04.687 --> 00:36:06.607
you gotta let him spread his wings, man.

726
00:36:07.617 --> 00:36:08.707
Like this.

727
00:36:09.145 --> 00:36:10.021
...Yeah.

728
00:36:11.698 --> 00:36:13.092
I don't know.

729
00:36:17.298 --> 00:36:19.932
If this isn't nice...what is?

730
00:36:26.442 --> 00:36:27.482
I should go.

731
00:36:28.731 --> 00:36:31.057
Yeah, and--and catch that holes guy.

732
00:36:31.082 --> 00:36:32.345
Don't worry.

733
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:34.439
I don't think that guy's gonna show his face again.

734
00:36:35.489 --> 00:36:36.249
What?

735
00:36:37.294 --> 00:36:38.014
Okay...

736
00:36:39.964 --> 00:36:41.494
I think I kicked myself...

737
00:36:42.319 --> 00:36:43.379
...into myself.

738
00:36:45.606 --> 00:36:46.873
Well, this is new.

739
00:36:47.337 --> 00:36:48.757
Helloooo...!

740
00:36:48.782 --> 00:36:50.601
Hello! Echo, echo, echo--no echo.

741
00:36:52.119 --> 00:36:53.079
Hypothesis:

742
00:36:54.019 --> 00:36:55.746
I'm going to put my head in that hole.

743
00:37:03.354 --> 00:37:05.570
Ow! Ow, ow, ow! Stop it, stop it, stop it!

744
00:37:07.271 --> 00:37:08.231
That was...

745
00:37:08.972 --> 00:37:09.859
cool!

746
00:37:10.893 --> 00:37:13.533
My holes can take me anywhere.

747
00:37:21.999 --> 00:37:22.726
Excuse me!

748
00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:23.697
Hi.

749
00:37:23.722 --> 00:37:25.610
Sorry to bug you, I know you're busy, sorry.

750
00:37:25.635 --> 00:37:27.855
- What do you want?
- I know it's weird, I just came out of nowhere,

751
00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:30.906
but I think I'm becoming a trans-dimensional superbeing.

752
00:37:30.931 --> 00:37:31.480
So?

753
00:37:31.505 --> 00:37:32.299
-So?

754
00:37:32.324 --> 00:37:36.042
I'm literally splitting the fabric of space and time!

755
00:37:36.768 --> 00:37:38.034
For you, it's just a Tuesday night.

756
00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.893
You're acting like weird stuff like this happens to you all the time.

757
00:37:42.632 --> 00:37:43.892
Can I have some gum?

758
00:37:43.917 --> 00:37:45.360
Ahhh, whoa!

759
00:37:48.254 --> 00:37:48.814
Wow.

760
00:37:50.021 --> 00:37:52.695
The power of the multiverse in the palm of my hand.

761
00:37:53.995 --> 00:37:55.522
My holes aren't a curse!

762
00:37:55.547 --> 00:37:56.683
They're the answer!

763
00:37:56.708 --> 00:37:58.816
Can you stop talking about your holes?

764
00:37:58.841 --> 00:38:00.473
You're making everyone uncomfortable over here.

765
00:38:00.498 --> 00:38:02.044
No, no, no! You're gonna love this. Look, look, look.

766
00:38:05.612 --> 00:38:07.179
I'm outta spots. Wouldn't ya know it?

767
00:38:07.609 --> 00:38:08.762
Uhh...

768
00:38:08.787 --> 00:38:09.980
As you were, gentlemen.

769
00:38:10.706 --> 00:38:12.699
I'm coming for you, Spiderman!

770
00:38:19.674 --> 00:38:20.403
Oh no.

771
00:38:20.428 --> 00:38:21.414
Tomorrow morning, Spiderman.

772
00:38:21.439 --> 00:38:24.029
- Page one with a decent picture this time!
- Uh-huh. Yeah, absolutely right, boss. I'm--

773
00:38:24.054 --> 00:38:24.369
Shut up.

774
00:38:24.394 --> 00:38:24.849
Uh-huh.

775
00:38:24.874 --> 00:38:25.867
- Get outta here!
- You got it, boss.

776
00:38:25.892 --> 00:38:26.934
I'm on it!

777
00:38:26.959 --> 00:38:28.616
God, I need a raise.

778
00:38:30.992 --> 00:38:31.745
Beep, beep!

779
00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:33.006
Miguel, it's Peter.

780
00:38:33.494 --> 00:38:34.527
We got an anomaly.

781
00:38:34.552 --> 00:38:36.239
Thank you, Peter. You're one of our best.

782
00:38:36.264 --> 00:38:37.504
Jess? Who's on this?

783
00:38:37.529 --> 00:38:38.471
Beep, beep.

784
00:38:52.269 --> 00:38:53.159
Have you seen Miles?

785
00:38:53.184 --> 00:38:53.507
Nope.

786
00:38:54.581 --> 00:38:54.875
Hey!

787
00:38:56.197 --> 00:38:57.051
What about Miles?

788
00:38:57.076 --> 00:38:57.388
Nope.

789
00:38:58.527 --> 00:38:59.467
Have you seen Miles?

790
00:39:01.569 --> 00:39:02.659
-What are you doing?
-Well?

791
00:39:02.684 --> 00:39:05.006
-Speech! Okay, everybody!
-What? No!

792
00:39:05.031 --> 00:39:06.979
Todos!

793
00:39:07.004 --> 00:39:08.554
- Oh, dear God, no.
- It's time for the speech!

794
00:39:10.102 --> 00:39:11.349
Rio, come on.

795
00:39:11.865 --> 00:39:13.038
Ummm...

796
00:39:13.063 --> 00:39:14.178
Hi.

797
00:39:14.203 --> 00:39:16.261
"And I want you to know, no matter what,

798
00:39:16.286 --> 00:39:18.261
even though we've had our ups and downs,

799
00:39:18.286 --> 00:39:19.971
I am so proud of you today!

800
00:39:19.996 --> 00:39:22.655
-And every day!" Parenthesis, "mostly.
-Hey. Umm, hey.

801
00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:24.843
-"LOL". Heh. "PS--"
-Hey, Mr. Spiderman.

802
00:39:24.868 --> 00:39:26.422
It won't fit on one cake.

803
00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:30.196
Can't you write smaller?

804
00:39:30.918 --> 00:39:32.385
Can't you write shorter?

805
00:39:34.518 --> 00:39:35.338
Come again!

806
00:39:35.363 --> 00:39:37.990
Uhhh, what else can I say about Jeff?

807
00:39:38.488 --> 00:39:41.568
That he was almost ten pounds as a baby!

808
00:39:41.593 --> 00:39:43.112
I know, I know! You're gonna be embarrassed. You're gonna be...

809
00:39:43.137 --> 00:39:45.775
[muttering]...he almost killed his mother. Look at those shoulders.

810
00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:48.077
-Oh, no. Okay, okay, okay, that's it, okay.
-He was a big baby.

811
00:39:48.102 --> 00:39:50.363
- Oh my God!
- Okay.

812
00:39:50.388 --> 00:39:53.637
- Oh, he's so funny!
- Ohh, I'll take the mic. No more mics for you.

813
00:39:54.014 --> 00:39:56.440
- Thank you Rio, for that.
- Where is that kid?

814
00:39:56.465 --> 00:39:59.310
- You know, I didn't always know what I wanted to do in life.

815
00:39:59.882 --> 00:40:03.135
-I was pulled in a lot of different directions when I was young.

816
00:40:04.235 --> 00:40:06.175
-You know, me and my brother came up in this neighborhood,

817
00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.626
-just a couple of knuckleheads running the streets.

818
00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:12.853
You guys used to...

819
00:40:13.734 --> 00:40:15.447
- chase us outta your stores, and now,
- Hey! Taxi!

820
00:40:15.472 --> 00:40:17.640
- if you can believe it, it's my job to look out for you.
- Thank you. Thank you.

821
00:40:18.377 --> 00:40:20.383
- And then, I had a kid,
- Be right back!

822
00:40:20.408 --> 00:40:22.809
and everything changed.

823
00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:24.156
For the better.

824
00:40:25.802 --> 00:40:28.488
- I mean, I don't even know about giving a toast, 'cuz I...
- Hey! Hey! Wait!

825
00:40:28.513 --> 00:40:29.928
-I should be toasting you all.

826
00:40:32.173 --> 00:40:33.718
So, to my brother,

827
00:40:33.743 --> 00:40:35.994
who we miss every single day.

828
00:40:37.213 --> 00:40:39.840
He's definitely up there laughing at me, right now.

829
00:40:39.865 --> 00:40:41.665
They're making me captain, bro!

830
00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:45.310
To my wife, mi amor,

831
00:40:45.335 --> 00:40:48.741
I can't even start, 'cuz I'll never stop.

832
00:40:48.766 --> 00:40:51.492
You'll have to take the mic from me!

833
00:40:51.517 --> 00:40:52.990
And to my son...

834
00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:03.267
The reason that I do any of this in the first place.

835
00:41:04.919 --> 00:41:06.539
Well, I love you, Miles.

836
00:41:08.661 --> 00:41:11.941
And I will always, always be here for you.

837
00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:20.577
Vinny, man, come on! Drop the beat!

838
00:41:22.241 --> 00:41:24.520
I'm gonna kill that kid.

839
00:41:24.805 --> 00:41:27.939
- Hey, congrats, Jeff!
- Hey, hey! Hey!

840
00:41:27.964 --> 00:41:29.053
Thank you for coming!

841
00:41:47.735 --> 00:41:48.517
Hey, Miles!

842
00:41:48.542 --> 00:41:49.435
What's up, man?

843
00:41:50.402 --> 00:41:51.955
There you are. You keeping your head up with that school?

844
00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:53.216
Oh, yeah. You bet.

845
00:41:53.605 --> 00:41:54.231
¡Hola!

846
00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:57.537
Hey! Your parents have been looking for you.

847
00:41:57.562 --> 00:42:00.004
I don't know why, I've just been here the whole time.

848
00:42:00.029 --> 00:42:00.762
-¡Oye!
-Aaah!

849
00:42:00.787 --> 00:42:02.349
-Hi!
-You were supposed to be here at 5.

850
00:42:02.374 --> 00:42:04.251
-I know, I know, I know, but-
-You're disrespecting your dad!

851
00:42:04.276 --> 00:42:06.516
-Yep. Mm-hmm.
-Missed his beautiful toast,

852
00:42:06.541 --> 00:42:08.370
Come on, did you even see the cakes?

853
00:42:08.395 --> 00:42:10.197
There's some heartfelt messages on them!

854
00:42:13.951 --> 00:42:15.664
That's...not what I meant.

855
00:42:15.689 --> 00:42:17.626
Your dad studied for 8 months.

856
00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:18.327
9!

857
00:42:18.705 --> 00:42:19.505
It was like giving birth!

858
00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:20.131
No it wasn't.

859
00:42:20.156 --> 00:42:20.751
Of course not.

860
00:42:20.776 --> 00:42:23.047
You made us sit in that office to talk to that lady without you!

861
00:42:23.072 --> 00:42:24.560
Gah, it was an emergency!

862
00:42:24.585 --> 00:42:26.170
What, a graffiti emergency?

863
00:42:26.195 --> 00:42:28.240
A party with some friends I've never met emergency?!

864
00:42:28.265 --> 00:42:28.990
Explain yourself.

865
00:42:29.015 --> 00:42:31.163
[muttering] Sounds like you're explaining it pretty well.

866
00:42:31.188 --> 00:42:32.237
Ha. That's funny.

867
00:42:32.262 --> 00:42:33.779
Jeff, we have a funny son.

868
00:42:33.804 --> 00:42:34.435
I'm not laughing.

869
00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:38.075
-¡Hola!
-Hey!

870
00:42:40.259 --> 00:42:42.663
-I don't feel grown up.
-Wow, this is a cool shirt!

871
00:42:42.688 --> 00:42:43.805
-Okay! Okay, okay.
-It's like a...

872
00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:45.465
You know, have you checked out the...?

873
00:42:48.447 --> 00:42:49.140
¡Oye!

874
00:42:49.165 --> 00:42:49.795
Aahh!

875
00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:51.209
Who are you running around with, anyway?

876
00:42:51.234 --> 00:42:52.204
-Just...
-Is it Genki?

877
00:42:52.229 --> 00:42:53.061
I never liked him.

878
00:42:53.086 --> 00:42:53.958
Yes, you did!

879
00:42:53.983 --> 00:42:55.092
He calls me by my first name.

880
00:42:55.117 --> 00:42:56.160
Ugh. We hate that.

881
00:42:56.185 --> 00:42:57.963
I have more friends than just Genki.

882
00:42:57.988 --> 00:42:58.584
Like who?

883
00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:00.173
Well, there's...there's...

884
00:43:00.198 --> 00:43:00.673
Peter.

885
00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:02.224
Y'know? Uhh...

886
00:43:02.249 --> 00:43:05.033
But he left town, umm...there's...

887
00:43:05.058 --> 00:43:06.151
There's Gwanda!

888
00:43:06.176 --> 00:43:08.668
Y'know? She--she also...left town...

889
00:43:08.693 --> 00:43:10.168
Miles, por favor, dame un break.

890
00:43:10.193 --> 00:43:11.239
Is that Spanglish?

891
00:43:11.852 --> 00:43:15.272
Has it ever occurred to you that maybe, I'm just doing...

892
00:43:15.297 --> 00:43:19.039
benign, private, unremarkable things when I'm not with you guys?

893
00:43:19.064 --> 00:43:19.558
- Nope.
- Never.

894
00:43:19.583 --> 00:43:21.172
I am 15 years old!

895
00:43:21.197 --> 00:43:23.357
- I am basically an adult!
- Oh, right! Right.

896
00:43:23.382 --> 00:43:25.021
- You don't even have a driver's license!
- Neither does Mom!

897
00:43:25.046 --> 00:43:27.541
Because we live in New York, and never plan to leave.

898
00:43:27.843 --> 00:43:29.923
-It's my life!
-It's not your life!

899
00:43:30.307 --> 00:43:33.447
It's mine. And your father's, and your abuelos y abuelas,

900
00:43:33.472 --> 00:43:37.048
who put you in this spot I'd give anything to be in.

901
00:43:37.073 --> 00:43:38.873
Alright, alright. Whatever. Whatever.

902
00:43:42.019 --> 00:43:43.072
Whatever?

903
00:43:43.097 --> 00:43:45.188
-Woooow.
-Whatever?!

904
00:43:45.213 --> 00:43:46.912
Do I get to say it?

905
00:43:46.937 --> 00:43:48.419
- Please tell me that I can say it.
- Say it.

906
00:43:48.444 --> 00:43:49.210
You're grounded!

907
00:43:49.235 --> 00:43:49.524
What?

908
00:43:49.549 --> 00:43:50.131
Oh, yeah!

909
00:43:50.156 --> 00:43:50.918
For how long?

910
00:43:50.943 --> 00:43:52.264
-A month!
-Dad!

911
00:43:52.289 --> 00:43:53.222
Mom, are you--

912
00:43:53.247 --> 00:43:53.959
Seriously?

913
00:43:53.984 --> 00:43:55.184
Yeah! Dead serious!

914
00:43:55.209 --> 00:43:56.071
You don't understand!

915
00:43:56.096 --> 00:43:57.627
You're right! You are right!

916
00:43:57.652 --> 00:44:00.292
I have no idea what's going on with you!

917
00:44:00.317 --> 00:44:02.606
- So, why don't you tell me?
- Just listen to me!

918
00:44:02.631 --> 00:44:04.279
Okay, champ! You got it!

919
00:44:04.304 --> 00:44:06.412
Go for it. Say whatever you wanna say.

920
00:44:06.437 --> 00:44:08.606
What do you got to tell me so bad?!

921
00:44:19.228 --> 00:44:20.344
You know what?

922
00:44:20.369 --> 00:44:21.070
Never mind.

923
00:44:24.073 --> 00:44:25.907
Alright, great. Walk away.

924
00:44:25.932 --> 00:44:27.728
Because now you got two months!

925
00:44:31.744 --> 00:44:32.864
That was good, right?

926
00:44:42.394 --> 00:44:43.547
Two months.

927
00:44:45.236 --> 00:44:46.443
I'm Spiderman.

928
00:44:46.467 --> 00:44:47.495
I'm not grounded.

929
00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:40.623
Miles!

930
00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:42.447
-Miles!

931
00:45:43.526 --> 00:45:44.326
Got a minute?

932
00:45:44.492 --> 00:45:45.979
Whoa! What...

933
00:45:46.173 --> 00:45:47.980
H-how did you get...

934
00:45:49.513 --> 00:45:50.133
How did you get-

935
00:45:50.572 --> 00:45:51.639
How have you been?

936
00:45:51.664 --> 00:45:53.339
Uhh--I've been...good.

937
00:45:53.364 --> 00:45:54.732
I've been...yeah, just great.

938
00:45:54.757 --> 00:45:55.526
Look at you!

939
00:45:55.974 --> 00:45:57.680
You, uhh...you grew, huh?

940
00:45:57.705 --> 00:45:59.178
-Had a little growth spurt?
-Uhh, yeah.

941
00:45:59.203 --> 00:46:01.771
Your hair has gotten...

942
00:46:01.796 --> 00:46:02.278
pinker.

943
00:46:02.303 --> 00:46:03.351
Is this the room you grew up in?

944
00:46:03.376 --> 00:46:04.044
It is.

945
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:05.507
Umm...but...

946
00:46:05.957 --> 00:46:08.177
My dorm room is--is... very adult.

947
00:46:08.491 --> 00:46:10.404
Cool, yeah, no, I used to play with these when I was younger, too.

948
00:46:10.429 --> 00:46:11.336
Uhh, that's...

949
00:46:11.361 --> 00:46:12.846
- that's a...that's a collectible.
- Wow!

950
00:46:12.871 --> 00:46:14.416
-I used to have this one!
-Actually, that's an

951
00:46:14.441 --> 00:46:17.146
- extremely rare...highly sought-after...
- Why is it still in the package?

952
00:46:17.685 --> 00:46:18.320
Um...

953
00:46:20.032 --> 00:46:21.399
That's fine.

954
00:46:23.018 --> 00:46:24.071
- Hey!
- Are these your drawings?

955
00:46:24.096 --> 00:46:25.910
- What? No.
- Wow, they're good!

956
00:46:28.002 --> 00:46:29.042
Wow, there's...

957
00:46:29.067 --> 00:46:30.796
so...many...

958
00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:33.954
Missed you, too.

959
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:35.947
So...

960
00:46:35.972 --> 00:46:37.457
what are you doing here?

961
00:46:37.482 --> 00:46:39.882
I-I mean, I...thought I'd...

962
00:46:39.907 --> 00:46:41.114
never see you again.

963
00:46:42.468 --> 00:46:43.401
Wanna get outta here?

964
00:46:44.451 --> 00:46:46.491
I'm...grounded.

965
00:46:47.717 --> 00:46:48.597
Bummer.

966
00:46:52.021 --> 00:46:53.747
Is Spiderman grounded?

967
00:46:54.439 --> 00:46:55.286
Uhhh...

968
00:46:57.427 --> 00:46:58.200
I mean, I-

969
00:47:04.998 --> 00:47:06.018
Miles?

970
00:47:06.343 --> 00:47:08.617
Your dad's ready to listen now.

971
00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:17.653
That's three months!

972
00:47:19.398 --> 00:47:20.318
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

973
00:47:20.895 --> 00:47:24.508
There's an elite society with all the best Spiderpeople in it?

974
00:47:24.549 --> 00:47:25.743
Okay, so there's this lady.

975
00:47:25.768 --> 00:47:27.838
-Jess Drew. She rides a motorcycle,
-Uh-huh?

976
00:47:27.863 --> 00:47:30.067
-A motorcycle?
-Oh my gosh, I'm learning so much from her!

977
00:47:30.092 --> 00:47:32.248
Oh, yeah, I've...I've learned a lot of stuff, too.

978
00:47:32.766 --> 00:47:34.159
I've leveled up my whole thing!

979
00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:35.047
See?

980
00:47:35.072 --> 00:47:37.082
-Eh?
-Oh, yeah? Let's see it, then.

981
00:47:37.107 --> 00:47:38.036
Let's go!

982
00:47:38.061 --> 00:47:39.041
Thread the needle!

983
00:47:43.488 --> 00:47:44.068
Whoa!

984
00:47:47.524 --> 00:47:48.304
Easy!

985
00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:50.050
And Miguel.

986
00:47:50.075 --> 00:47:52.202
The whole thing was his idea.

987
00:47:52.227 --> 00:47:53.831
And...who's Miguel?

988
00:47:53.856 --> 00:47:57.411
Oh, he's like a...ninja, vampire Spiderman, but a good guy?

989
00:47:57.436 --> 00:47:59.024
A vampire good guy!

990
00:47:59.049 --> 00:48:00.665
I'd pay good money to see that.

991
00:48:00.690 --> 00:48:02.480
So, how long ago did they invite you?

992
00:48:02.505 --> 00:48:04.718
Uh, only, like...a few months ago.

993
00:48:04.743 --> 00:48:06.543
"Months" is kind of a long time, isn't it?

994
00:48:06.568 --> 00:48:08.115
Okay, this one counts as two.

995
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:13.190
Whooo!

996
00:48:15.474 --> 00:48:16.360
Look at you.

997
00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:17.907
Look at me!

998
00:48:19.473 --> 00:48:20.366
Keep the change!

999
00:48:21.052 --> 00:48:21.905
So, this club...

1000
00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:22.989
Look at that dumb-dumb.

1001
00:48:23.014 --> 00:48:24.134
...What kind of stuff do you do?

1002
00:48:24.159 --> 00:48:25.402
Guy in the stripes. Ten points.

1003
00:48:25.948 --> 00:48:28.188
We're trying to keep the
multiverse from collapsing.

1004
00:48:28.437 --> 00:48:29.820
I thought we did that already.

1005
00:48:29.845 --> 00:48:32.340
Like, last week we had this mission
to some Shakespeare dimension,

1006
00:48:32.365 --> 00:48:32.687
What?

1007
00:48:32.712 --> 00:48:34.527
- And Hobie and I just, like...
- Wait, wait, wait.

1008
00:48:34.552 --> 00:48:36.260
- Who--who's Hobie?
- Oh my gosh,

1009
00:48:36.285 --> 00:48:37.568
you would love him!

1010
00:48:37.593 --> 00:48:39.324
He lets me crash in his dimension sometimes.

1011
00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:41.851
Hey, what does that mean? You stay overnight, or...?

1012
00:48:41.876 --> 00:48:44.923
Anyway, listen, they're--they're pretty
strict about where I go, or I...

1013
00:48:44.948 --> 00:48:46.720
I really would've come to see you sooner.

1014
00:48:46.745 --> 00:48:47.570
Right...

1015
00:48:47.595 --> 00:48:48.355
so, uhh...

1016
00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:50.009
so...so why'd you come now?

1017
00:48:50.034 --> 00:48:51.905
Don't--don't do that.

1018
00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:52.637
Ah!

1019
00:48:55.041 --> 00:48:55.901
Hey, Gw-...

1020
00:48:55.926 --> 00:48:57.419
uhh...Gwen?

1021
00:48:58.368 --> 00:48:59.328
Where'd you go?

1022
00:49:02.456 --> 00:49:03.403
Where'd she go...?

1023
00:49:15.604 --> 00:49:16.371
Ah!

1024
00:49:16.396 --> 00:49:17.875
Oh, hey. There you are.

1025
00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:18.698
What are you doing?

1026
00:49:18.723 --> 00:49:19.417
Waitin' for you.

1027
00:49:36.635 --> 00:49:38.088
This is a cool thinking spot.

1028
00:49:38.113 --> 00:49:38.642
Right?

1029
00:49:39.008 --> 00:49:42.335
I mean, who needs a treadmill when you have the Williamsburg Bank building?

1030
00:49:45.651 --> 00:49:47.985
So, uhh...you and your dad.

1031
00:49:48.872 --> 00:49:49.899
You still haven't talked?

1032
00:49:50.471 --> 00:49:53.551
What exactly would we talk about?

1033
00:49:53.576 --> 00:49:55.422
"Hey, Dad. How's the last few months been?"

1034
00:49:56.715 --> 00:49:58.732
"You still think I murdered my best friend?"

1035
00:50:01.642 --> 00:50:02.201
Oh.

1036
00:50:02.581 --> 00:50:03.955
I mean, my parents...

1037
00:50:04.347 --> 00:50:05.607
I mean, maybe if I told them-

1038
00:50:05.632 --> 00:50:06.320
Don't.

1039
00:50:07.084 --> 00:50:08.537
Trust me on that.

1040
00:50:24.792 --> 00:50:25.505
Well...

1041
00:50:27.646 --> 00:50:30.275
Maybe, some things are supposed to be just for us.

1042
00:50:32.084 --> 00:50:32.671
Hmm.

1043
00:50:34.716 --> 00:50:36.369
That's a nice way to think about it.

1044
00:50:38.012 --> 00:50:41.255
I'm just...a really emotionally intelligent guy.

1045
00:50:42.033 --> 00:50:43.250
Beyond my years.

1046
00:50:46.634 --> 00:50:48.787
You know, it really is always so great to talk to you.

1047
00:50:49.373 --> 00:50:49.986
Yeah?

1048
00:50:50.672 --> 00:50:51.152
Yeah.

1049
00:50:53.065 --> 00:50:56.151
I mean...how many people can you talk to about this stuff?

1050
00:50:57.698 --> 00:50:58.884
You don't even know.

1051
00:51:03.227 --> 00:51:04.013
What?

1052
00:51:06.056 --> 00:51:09.210
You're the only friend I've ever really made, after Peter died.

1053
00:51:10.801 --> 00:51:13.034
...Other than Hobie. Right?

1054
00:51:14.955 --> 00:51:16.138
That's different.

1055
00:51:16.163 --> 00:51:17.483
Yeah? How's that?

1056
00:51:17.836 --> 00:51:19.489
I don't know. You...

1057
00:51:20.121 --> 00:51:22.154
and me...it's...

1058
00:51:22.179 --> 00:51:23.747
We're...the same.

1059
00:51:26.973 --> 00:51:28.040
In the important ways.

1060
00:51:28.775 --> 00:51:29.501
Y'know?

1061
00:51:32.493 --> 00:51:35.947
In every other universe, Gwen Stacy falls for Spiderman.

1062
00:51:42.449 --> 00:51:45.290
And in every other universe...

1063
00:51:45.836 --> 00:51:47.439
it doesn't end well.

1064
00:51:58.944 --> 00:51:59.744
Well...

1065
00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:02.333
there's a first time for everything, right?

1066
00:52:23.413 --> 00:52:24.140
Mmm!

1067
00:52:24.354 --> 00:52:25.441
Oh, wow.

1068
00:52:25.913 --> 00:52:27.060
Feelings make me hungry.

1069
00:52:27.085 --> 00:52:27.720
Oh, yeah.

1070
00:52:27.745 --> 00:52:29.961
These plátanos are just deep fried filling.

1071
00:52:32.269 --> 00:52:33.725
She looks old enough to vote.

1072
00:52:35.138 --> 00:52:37.205
I bet she doesn't even speak Spanish.

1073
00:52:40.445 --> 00:52:42.411
This keeps you from glitching in other dimensions?

1074
00:52:42.436 --> 00:52:43.339
-Yeah. It's pretty cool.

1075
00:52:43.364 --> 00:52:46.361
What's it gonna take for Miguel O'Hara to notice Miles Morales?

1076
00:52:46.386 --> 00:52:48.914
I'll put in a good word.

1077
00:52:48.939 --> 00:52:51.557
I'm just saying. If I had a watch, I could come with you.

1078
00:52:51.582 --> 00:52:52.344
Miles...

1079
00:52:52.369 --> 00:52:53.884
-Look...
-I did save the multiverse!

1080
00:52:53.909 --> 00:52:55.948
It's a...really small, elite strike force...

1081
00:52:55.973 --> 00:52:58.494
-I can turn invisible, I have like, electric powers...
-There's just-

1082
00:52:58.519 --> 00:53:00.280
- There aren't a lot of slots.
- Think about it!

1083
00:53:02.049 --> 00:53:03.489
Uh-huh. Right.

1084
00:53:04.188 --> 00:53:07.162
-Look, if it was up to me, you-
-Oh, I know. I know.

1085
00:53:09.997 --> 00:53:12.292
Oh, no! No, no, no! Don't do that! Miles!

1086
00:53:12.931 --> 00:53:14.895
-Alright. Jeez.
-It's, uhh...it's really delicate.

1087
00:53:16.634 --> 00:53:19.522
Sorry. Didn't mean to, um...snap.

1088
00:53:19.547 --> 00:53:21.591
Okay. Alright. I'm sorry.

1089
00:53:21.616 --> 00:53:22.806
Helloooo!

1090
00:53:22.831 --> 00:53:25.546
- Hi. I'm Miles' mom.
- Oh, boy.

1091
00:53:25.571 --> 00:53:26.857
Rio! Hi!

1092
00:53:26.882 --> 00:53:28.583
I've heard so much about you!

1093
00:53:28.608 --> 00:53:30.635
Huh. You're using my first name. Okay!

1094
00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:33.060
This is nice. We found it in Miles' room, so...

1095
00:53:33.698 --> 00:53:35.845
I guess you must've been there. Huh?

1096
00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:36.716
And you must be Jeff.

1097
00:53:36.741 --> 00:53:39.160
She called me Jeff. Heh, seriously. Jeff.

1098
00:53:39.185 --> 00:53:41.313
You must mean Lieutenant Morales.

1099
00:53:41.338 --> 00:53:43.410
Soon to be Captain Morales.

1100
00:53:43.435 --> 00:53:45.116
Ah! Captain.

1101
00:53:46.597 --> 00:53:49.617
Gwanda and I are friends from school.

1102
00:53:49.642 --> 00:53:51.096
Yeah, yeah. We were just catching up.

1103
00:53:51.121 --> 00:53:52.248
Ohhh.

1104
00:53:52.273 --> 00:53:53.235
Don't take him from me!

1105
00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:54.968
Mom!

1106
00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:57.854
I'm just kidding. He's grounded, so you can't.

1107
00:53:58.042 --> 00:53:59.268
- Don't break his heart.
- Mom!

1108
00:53:59.551 --> 00:54:00.464
Shoot!

1109
00:54:00.489 --> 00:54:01.620
Shoot, I have to go.

1110
00:54:01.645 --> 00:54:02.334
Really?

1111
00:54:02.359 --> 00:54:04.934
Yeah, I, uh...forgot to get my steps in!

1112
00:54:04.959 --> 00:54:07.089
Uhh, really...really wish I could stay longer.

1113
00:54:07.114 --> 00:54:08.342
I, uh... I'm sorry.

1114
00:54:09.253 --> 00:54:09.946
Goodbye.

1115
00:54:14.304 --> 00:54:15.197
...Yeah. Bye.

1116
00:54:50.641 --> 00:54:52.768
I can hear you being quiet, Mom.

1117
00:54:54.094 --> 00:54:55.000
I, um...

1118
00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:57.678
hope I didn't ice your game, man.

1119
00:54:58.346 --> 00:55:01.653
No one my age says those words in that order, Mom.

1120
00:55:02.481 --> 00:55:03.947
It's just...

1121
00:55:03.972 --> 00:55:08.145
hard, to see my little man not be my little boy all the time.

1122
00:55:09.779 --> 00:55:10.739
Yeah.

1123
00:55:16.115 --> 00:55:18.108
I hope you know you can tell me anything.

1124
00:55:28.631 --> 00:55:29.171
Well...

1125
00:55:49.223 --> 00:55:50.096
I'm...

1126
00:55:57.144 --> 00:55:58.238
I'm sorry I was late.

1127
00:56:07.931 --> 00:56:08.645
Go.

1128
00:56:11.651 --> 00:56:13.871
She seems like a...nice girl.

1129
00:56:16.328 --> 00:56:17.114
Is this a trick?

1130
00:56:17.139 --> 00:56:18.341
It's not a trick.

1131
00:56:18.919 --> 00:56:19.559
Jeez.

1132
00:56:20.512 --> 00:56:21.145
What're you...

1133
00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:23.423
Lemme fix you, just...

1134
00:56:24.376 --> 00:56:27.109
well, for years, I've been taking care of this little boy, right?

1135
00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:30.227
Making sure he's loved,

1136
00:56:31.065 --> 00:56:34.518
that he feels like he belongs wherever he wants to be,

1137
00:56:36.130 --> 00:56:39.403
he wants to go out into the world and do great big things...

1138
00:56:40.701 --> 00:56:42.334
and what I worry about most

1139
00:56:43.924 --> 00:56:46.597
is...they won't look out for you, like us.

1140
00:56:47.919 --> 00:56:50.152
They won't root for you, like us.

1141
00:56:52.762 --> 00:56:53.469
So.

1142
00:56:54.219 --> 00:56:55.539
Here's the deal.

1143
00:56:56.743 --> 00:56:57.962
Wherever you go from here

1144
00:56:57.986 --> 00:57:00.976
you have to promise to take care of that little boy for me.

1145
00:57:01.995 --> 00:57:04.008
Make sure he never forgets where he came from.

1146
00:57:05.287 --> 00:57:06.228
And...

1147
00:57:06.658 --> 00:57:08.698
he never doubts that he is loved.

1148
00:57:09.954 --> 00:57:12.447
And he never lets anyone

1149
00:57:12.472 --> 00:57:15.361
at those big fancy places he's gonna be in...

1150
00:57:16.064 --> 00:57:18.931
tell him that he doesn't belong there.

1151
00:57:20.184 --> 00:57:22.924
And when he comes home--and he'd better come home!

1152
00:57:25.375 --> 00:57:26.576
You're gonna be early,

1153
00:57:27.302 --> 00:57:30.128
and you're gonna be holding a normal, nice cake.

1154
00:57:30.419 --> 00:57:31.973
Yeah, okay.

1155
00:57:32.733 --> 00:57:34.086
You gotta promise, Miles.

1156
00:57:34.789 --> 00:57:35.769
I promise.

1157
00:57:36.790 --> 00:57:37.396
Just...

1158
00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:40.445
don't get lost.

1159
00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:41.753
Mm-hmm. Yep.

1160
00:57:41.778 --> 00:57:42.628
¿Me oyes?

1161
00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:43.994
Alright!

1162
00:57:45.317 --> 00:57:46.071
Cool.

1163
00:57:54.956 --> 00:57:56.476
Now, get--go. Get outta here.

1164
00:57:59.814 --> 00:58:01.527
But when you come back, you're still grounded.

1165
00:58:02.306 --> 00:58:04.887
Yeah, I'm smiling like it's a joke, but it's true.

1166
00:58:04.912 --> 00:58:06.508
Yeah, I-I figured.

1167
00:58:07.308 --> 00:58:08.288
See you later.

1168
00:58:09.290 --> 00:58:09.984
With a cake.

1169
00:59:01.655 --> 00:59:02.621
Shoot.

1170
00:59:06.264 --> 00:59:07.725
Whoa, hey, hey, hey! The car!

1171
00:59:17.096 --> 00:59:18.329
Aw, shoot.

1172
00:59:27.919 --> 00:59:30.446
Oh, shoot, shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot...

1173
00:59:39.199 --> 00:59:40.467
Show me what happened.

1174
00:59:40.492 --> 00:59:41.406
Replay commencing.

1175
00:59:41.431 --> 00:59:42.467
...spots! That's the thing.

1176
00:59:42.492 --> 00:59:44.430
I need more spots!

1177
00:59:44.455 --> 00:59:47.062
Oh, my God! It was right under where my...

1178
00:59:47.087 --> 00:59:49.336
my nose would've been! I just...

1179
00:59:49.361 --> 00:59:52.021
need a little bit more dimensional juice, or whatever.

1180
00:59:52.046 --> 00:59:53.449
- Shoot!
- Never did come up with a cool name for that...

1181
00:59:53.474 --> 00:59:55.041
Branding was never my strong suit.

1182
00:59:55.066 --> 00:59:57.532
...powerline to my micro-collider...prototype,

1183
00:59:57.557 --> 01:00:00.219
could generate a little more concentrated dark energy...

1184
01:00:01.987 --> 01:00:04.420
- This is what I love about heists!
- Shoot, shoot!

1185
01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:08.181
I just need enough to get me somewhere with a full-sized collider.

1186
01:00:09.956 --> 01:00:10.751
And Spiderman...

1187
01:00:11.218 --> 01:00:12.805
I'll make you pay...

1188
01:00:13.296 --> 01:00:15.283
for everything you took away from me.

1189
01:00:16.161 --> 01:00:16.988
This should work!

1190
01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:20.466
Or vaporize me and everything in this building.

1191
01:00:21.572 --> 01:00:22.552
Oh, what the heck?

1192
01:00:23.033 --> 01:00:23.706
Shoot.

1193
01:00:25.097 --> 01:00:25.830
Oh!

1194
01:00:27.963 --> 01:00:28.690
I did it!

1195
01:00:32.029 --> 01:00:32.735
Ow!

1196
01:00:36.375 --> 01:00:36.982
Oof...

1197
01:00:44.318 --> 01:00:44.851
Shoot.

1198
01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:50.086
Replay complete.

1199
01:00:50.111 --> 01:00:52.540
No! Why, why, why, why, why?!

1200
01:00:53.422 --> 01:00:54.524
Gwen, Gwen, Gwen, Gwen-

1201
01:00:54.549 --> 01:00:55.277
Jess: Gwen!

1202
01:00:55.734 --> 01:00:56.560
Hi!

1203
01:00:56.585 --> 01:00:58.056
-What'cha doing?

1204
01:00:58.081 --> 01:00:58.731
Nothing!

1205
01:00:58.756 --> 01:01:00.184
Uhh...good! All good.

1206
01:01:00.209 --> 01:01:02.051
Yeah, everything's good. Um...

1207
01:01:02.076 --> 01:01:02.666
Bye!

1208
01:01:03.509 --> 01:01:06.337
Where's the...the bad guy you were supposed to monitor?

1209
01:01:06.362 --> 01:01:07.622
Oh, he just stepped out for a moment.

1210
01:01:07.647 --> 01:01:08.271
Dude!

1211
01:01:08.296 --> 01:01:09.731
Look, he's just some villain of the week!

1212
01:01:09.756 --> 01:01:10.195
Lyla?

1213
01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:10.908
Oh, we don't need-

1214
01:01:10.933 --> 01:01:12.148
Tracking...

1215
01:01:12.173 --> 01:01:13.096
Oh, hey, look! I got him!

1216
01:01:13.121 --> 01:01:14.463
Nope, never mind.

1217
01:01:14.488 --> 01:01:15.648
Hold on--oh!

1218
01:01:15.673 --> 01:01:16.448
Slippery guy.

1219
01:01:17.266 --> 01:01:18.386
Did you go see your little friend?

1220
01:01:18.411 --> 01:01:20.107
What? No! Miles?

1221
01:01:20.132 --> 01:01:20.533
I mean...

1222
01:01:20.558 --> 01:01:23.227
-Are you kidding me right now?
-Only briefly!

1223
01:01:23.455 --> 01:01:24.122
From afar.

1224
01:01:24.147 --> 01:01:24.942
How far?

1225
01:01:24.967 --> 01:01:25.602
Like...

1226
01:01:26.282 --> 01:01:28.028
you know...about this...

1227
01:01:28.053 --> 01:01:29.869
-About...this far apart...
-Oh, that's way too close.

1228
01:01:29.894 --> 01:01:30.994
Girl!

1229
01:01:31.019 --> 01:01:33.085
I just--look, I had to know how he was!

1230
01:01:33.893 --> 01:01:36.775
-I can't--I honestly can't with you.
-Look, I know I messed up, okay?!

1231
01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.504
- He can't be part of this.
- I...

1232
01:01:38.529 --> 01:01:39.244
-I know.

1233
01:01:40.276 --> 01:01:41.662
I'll never see him again.

1234
01:01:42.193 --> 01:01:43.360
- Alright?
- No kidding!

1235
01:01:43.385 --> 01:01:44.704
Hey, guys? Guys?

1236
01:01:44.729 --> 01:01:45.941
He's making his own portals.

1237
01:01:45.966 --> 01:01:46.646
What?

1238
01:01:46.671 --> 01:01:47.764
He can jump wherever he wants.

1239
01:01:48.264 --> 01:01:50.070
-He could be a total canon-killer.

1240
01:01:50.095 --> 01:01:51.735
You said he was a villain of the week!

1241
01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:53.480
Do you know how bad this is for you?

1242
01:01:53.505 --> 01:01:55.713
Every dimension he stops at has an Alchemax.

1243
01:01:55.738 --> 01:01:56.493
What's he up to, Gwen?

1244
01:01:56.518 --> 01:01:57.315
I don't know.

1245
01:01:58.993 --> 01:02:00.700
No, no! Amazing!

1246
01:02:00.725 --> 01:02:02.255
My star pupil, everyone.

1247
01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:03.917
I'll get him. Okay?

1248
01:02:03.942 --> 01:02:04.864
I can get backup.

1249
01:02:05.668 --> 01:02:07.088
If Miguel finds out I let you go-

1250
01:02:07.113 --> 01:02:08.369
Don't tell Miguel.

1251
01:02:08.934 --> 01:02:09.854
He'll kick me out, and...

1252
01:02:10.394 --> 01:02:11.541
what if he sends me home?

1253
01:02:13.558 --> 01:02:14.498
I got him!

1254
01:02:14.523 --> 01:02:16.044
Earth-50101.

1255
01:02:16.788 --> 01:02:17.474
Whaddya wanna do?

1256
01:02:20.309 --> 01:02:21.762
You never made a mistake?

1257
01:02:22.684 --> 01:02:24.271
Never got too close to someone?

1258
01:02:24.623 --> 01:02:25.610
I did.

1259
01:02:26.807 --> 01:02:28.100
But I got over it.

1260
01:02:31.805 --> 01:02:33.198
Alert the local Spider,

1261
01:02:33.223 --> 01:02:35.009
- tell him Gwen will meet him there.
- I'm on it.

1262
01:02:35.034 --> 01:02:36.291
-Oh, thank you. Thank you so much,
-Yeah. Okay.

1263
01:02:36.325 --> 01:02:38.339
-I promise I will not let you down again.
-You're welcome. Shut up.

1264
01:02:39.643 --> 01:02:41.590
You got an hour to fix this,

1265
01:02:42.577 --> 01:02:43.763
or I can't help you.

1266
01:03:12.045 --> 01:03:13.025
Goodbye, Miles.

1267
01:04:20.769 --> 01:04:23.082
Ah! Sorry! Sorry!

1268
01:04:23.202 --> 01:04:24.402
Whoa!

1269
01:04:24.427 --> 01:04:24.988
Oof!

1270
01:04:36.228 --> 01:04:37.615
You see that? This is incredible!

1271
01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:38.977
-I'm like a whole new person!

1272
01:04:39.002 --> 01:04:40.706
- Where did you go?
- If I were to look in the mirror right now,

1273
01:04:40.731 --> 01:04:41.880
- Stay still!
- I wouldn't recognize myself,

1274
01:04:41.905 --> 01:04:43.748
- but I would envy that person that was on the end!
- Slow down!

1275
01:04:43.773 --> 01:04:44.916
-I have eyes on the anomaly.

1276
01:04:44.941 --> 01:04:45.777
Try getting hands on.

1277
01:04:45.802 --> 01:04:47.477
Stop hovering. You're literally hovering.

1278
01:04:47.502 --> 01:04:49.037
Hello! Pardon me, locals!

1279
01:04:49.062 --> 01:04:51.687
Wow. Four on there, wow. That's very dangerous.

1280
01:04:51.712 --> 01:04:52.853
That looks good!

1281
01:04:52.878 --> 01:04:54.608
Which way to Alchemax--oh!

1282
01:04:54.633 --> 01:04:55.568
Hahh!

1283
01:04:55.593 --> 01:04:57.786
It's a place with a big collider--

1284
01:04:58.299 --> 01:04:59.439
Hey, cow spots!

1285
01:04:59.464 --> 01:05:00.443
Mooooove over!

1286
01:05:00.468 --> 01:05:01.516
That's the best you can do?

1287
01:05:01.541 --> 01:05:03.082
Gwen! I'm here to help!

1288
01:05:03.107 --> 01:05:03.701
Miles?!

1289
01:05:04.285 --> 01:05:05.174
Foot in your face!

1290
01:05:05.199 --> 01:05:06.520
You weren't expecting that, were you?

1291
01:05:07.219 --> 01:05:08.098
Oh, no!

1292
01:05:08.123 --> 01:05:10.012
Neither was I! I'm in the zone!

1293
01:05:10.037 --> 01:05:10.559
Whoo!

1294
01:05:12.570 --> 01:05:13.317
I got you!

1295
01:05:13.747 --> 01:05:15.127
-Did you follow me?!
-No!

1296
01:05:15.152 --> 01:05:17.814
I just saw where you went, and...

1297
01:05:17.839 --> 01:05:19.016
went there without you knowing.

1298
01:05:19.041 --> 01:05:20.334
You're not supposed to be here!

1299
01:05:20.359 --> 01:05:21.824
What are you talking about? I'm helping-

1300
01:05:24.029 --> 01:05:24.523
No!

1301
01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:27.040
No, no, no no no no no no! No!

1302
01:05:29.329 --> 01:05:29.915
Whoa!

1303
01:05:31.299 --> 01:05:32.753
I shouldn't have ever come to see you.

1304
01:05:33.595 --> 01:05:34.162
Dang.

1305
01:05:37.327 --> 01:05:38.053
Hyah!

1306
01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:39.340
Ahh!

1307
01:05:43.333 --> 01:05:44.747
Hey, who's the new guy?

1308
01:05:44.772 --> 01:05:45.508
Hey, Pav.

1309
01:05:45.533 --> 01:05:47.529
He's Miles, and he wasn't invited.

1310
01:05:47.554 --> 01:05:50.446
Oooh, you weren't invited, and you came anyway?

1311
01:05:50.471 --> 01:05:50.808
Right?

1312
01:05:50.833 --> 01:05:53.200
Hey, new guy must be in love with you.

1313
01:05:53.225 --> 01:05:54.259
- No...!
- Okay, whoa.

1314
01:05:54.284 --> 01:05:55.069
I'm not.

1315
01:05:55.094 --> 01:05:56.494
-Oh, I'm very good at reading people.
-No, he's not.

1316
01:05:56.519 --> 01:05:57.063
Who are you?

1317
01:05:57.088 --> 01:05:58.383
I'm glad you asked, new guy!

1318
01:05:58.408 --> 01:05:59.572
-I'm not a new guy.

1319
01:05:59.597 --> 01:06:01.989
My name is Pravitr Prabhakar.

1320
01:06:02.014 --> 01:06:03.357
And, for the past 6 months,

1321
01:06:03.382 --> 01:06:03.944
Six?

1322
01:06:03.969 --> 01:06:05.257
And even he got a watch?

1323
01:06:05.282 --> 01:06:05.918
Yeah, uhh...

1324
01:06:05.943 --> 01:06:08.134
Being Spiderman is so easy!

1325
01:06:08.159 --> 01:06:10.476
I wake up, skip the workout, because I'm naturally buff,

1326
01:06:10.501 --> 01:06:11.903
and I don't wanna get too big, you know?

1327
01:06:11.928 --> 01:06:13.881
Do almost nothing with my amazing hair,

1328
01:06:13.906 --> 01:06:15.277
You don't use any product at all?

1329
01:06:15.302 --> 01:06:17.315
Just coconut oil, prayer, some genetics...

1330
01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:20.057
Then I swing by school, don't really have to try, but I do anyway,

1331
01:06:20.082 --> 01:06:20.975
fight a few bad guys,

1332
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.182
feed a few street dogs,

1333
01:06:22.207 --> 01:06:24.096
quick break for a cup of chai with my Maya auntie,

1334
01:06:24.121 --> 01:06:25.138
I love chai tea!

1335
01:06:25.163 --> 01:06:26.625
What did you just say...?

1336
01:06:26.836 --> 01:06:27.963
"Chai tea"?

1337
01:06:27.988 --> 01:06:29.878
-"Chai" means tea, bro!
-Oh.

1338
01:06:29.903 --> 01:06:31.197
-You're saying "tea tea!"
-Oh, umm...uh...

1339
01:06:31.222 --> 01:06:32.299
Would I ask you for a "coffee coffee"?

1340
01:06:32.324 --> 01:06:33.966
-Hmm? Or "cream cream"?
-I'm sorry...I'm sorry!

1341
01:06:33.991 --> 01:06:34.657
I'm so sorry.

1342
01:06:34.682 --> 01:06:37.439
-Then, I hang out with my girlfriend, Gayatri.

1343
01:06:37.464 --> 01:06:39.869
-She's an extremely classy teenager.

1344
01:06:39.894 --> 01:06:42.348
Hey, girl. Tonight, I was thinking...

1345
01:06:42.373 --> 01:06:44.240
Ah, hello, police inspector Singh!

1346
01:06:44.265 --> 01:06:46.251
-This is your daughter, I do not know her.

1347
01:06:46.276 --> 01:06:47.366
-And to top it off,

1348
01:06:47.391 --> 01:06:49.906
I live in the best possible Spiderman city,

1349
01:06:49.931 --> 01:06:50.680
Mumbattan.

1350
01:06:50.705 --> 01:06:51.278
Quick tour.

1351
01:06:51.303 --> 01:06:52.195
This is where the traffic is,

1352
01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:52.871
this is where the traffic is,

1353
01:06:52.896 --> 01:06:53.793
this is also where the traffic is,

1354
01:06:53.818 --> 01:06:54.480
there's traffic here, too!

1355
01:06:54.505 --> 01:06:56.093
And this is where the British stole all of our stuff!

1356
01:06:58.832 --> 01:06:59.559
Ahh.

1357
01:07:00.103 --> 01:07:01.283
Hello, Spiderman.

1358
01:07:01.308 --> 01:07:01.981
-Hi.
-Hey.

1359
01:07:02.006 --> 01:07:02.765
Not you.

1360
01:07:02.790 --> 01:07:04.458
- Are you talking to him, or me? Or...him?
- Well, what's that...that's me.

1361
01:07:04.483 --> 01:07:05.284
I think he means me.

1362
01:07:05.309 --> 01:07:06.111
Yeah. Him.

1363
01:07:06.273 --> 01:07:07.627
I got this, guys!

1364
01:07:07.756 --> 01:07:08.470
Huh?

1365
01:07:08.495 --> 01:07:09.792
Wow! How are you?

1366
01:07:11.335 --> 01:07:12.755
Since I leveled up my game,

1367
01:07:13.184 --> 01:07:15.371
I'm on a journey of self-improvement!

1368
01:07:15.396 --> 01:07:17.320
And you came to India.

1369
01:07:17.345 --> 01:07:19.198
That's a Western culture cliche!

1370
01:07:20.583 --> 01:07:22.293
No, no, no! I did not mean it like that!

1371
01:07:22.318 --> 01:07:22.806
Now, let me guess.

1372
01:07:22.831 --> 01:07:25.929
You wanna ask me about saffron and cardamom and naan bread,

1373
01:07:25.954 --> 01:07:29.309
which is the same as saying "bread bread", which is the same as saying "chai tea"!

1374
01:07:29.334 --> 01:07:30.296
Oh, I love chai tea!

1375
01:07:30.321 --> 01:07:31.186
No!

1376
01:07:32.482 --> 01:07:33.528
C'mon, man!

1377
01:07:34.012 --> 01:07:36.199
I think maybe we got off on the wrong foot.

1378
01:07:36.224 --> 01:07:37.287
Let's talk about this!

1379
01:07:37.312 --> 01:07:37.906
Fine.

1380
01:07:37.931 --> 01:07:40.866
You made me feel empty, like I had a hole inside of me!

1381
01:07:40.891 --> 01:07:42.199
We all have holes.

1382
01:07:43.248 --> 01:07:45.411
But now, I found out what to fill that hole up with!

1383
01:07:46.357 --> 01:07:47.470
More holes!

1384
01:07:47.495 --> 01:07:49.316
That doesn't make any sense!

1385
01:07:49.341 --> 01:07:50.232
-It will!

1386
01:07:50.764 --> 01:07:52.121
Okay. I'm good.

1387
01:07:52.146 --> 01:07:53.542
-Don't worry.
- We won't.

1388
01:07:53.741 --> 01:07:56.221
This romantic tension is so palpable!

1389
01:07:56.246 --> 01:07:57.351
-Will they, won't they...?

1390
01:07:57.376 --> 01:07:59.845
If Spot gets more holes, he'll be unstoppable!

1391
01:07:59.870 --> 01:08:00.835
We can't let him get to-

1392
01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:01.775
Alchemax?

1393
01:08:02.054 --> 01:08:03.841
How can you guys even concentrate?

1394
01:08:05.595 --> 01:08:07.369
Hey, does he know about Hobie?

1395
01:08:07.394 --> 01:08:08.935
What should I know about Hobie?

1396
01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:10.808
Oh, looks like he did not know.

1397
01:08:13.389 --> 01:08:13.843
Boop.

1398
01:08:16.441 --> 01:08:17.981
Go away. Go away.

1399
01:08:18.006 --> 01:08:19.221
See you later. Take some holes.

1400
01:08:19.932 --> 01:08:23.165
Hey, you! Could you please deactivate this wonderfully strong barrier?

1401
01:08:23.190 --> 01:08:25.647
It can't be turned off until
the collider sequence is complete!

1402
01:08:25.672 --> 01:08:26.982
Collider sequence?

1403
01:08:30.492 --> 01:08:33.046
- Wait! You don't know what you're doing, man!
- Spot, you need to stop!

1404
01:08:33.071 --> 01:08:35.937
I'm about to be so much more than a villain of the week.

1405
01:08:35.962 --> 01:08:39.662
I'm sorry I called you that, okay?
You're a great villain.

1406
01:08:40.081 --> 01:08:41.127
Oh, not yet, I'm not.

1407
01:08:41.152 --> 01:08:42.621
Initializing collider.

1408
01:08:43.122 --> 01:08:43.942
No!

1409
01:08:49.581 --> 01:08:51.171
How's it going now?

1410
01:08:51.196 --> 01:08:51.856
Great!

1411
01:08:52.242 --> 01:08:53.259
Anyone got any ideas?

1412
01:08:53.291 --> 01:08:56.011
I have somebody in mind for this!

1413
01:08:56.508 --> 01:08:57.268
Stand back.

1414
01:08:57.774 --> 01:08:59.374
I've been working on something new.

1415
01:09:10.663 --> 01:09:13.097
I'm not following what's happening right now.

1416
01:09:13.122 --> 01:09:14.352
Just give me a second.

1417
01:09:14.377 --> 01:09:16.918
Do--do you want us to do something,
or do we just stand here?

1418
01:09:16.943 --> 01:09:18.532
Are you like, charging it...?

1419
01:09:18.557 --> 01:09:20.608
No, I'm absorbing it so I can send it back!

1420
01:09:20.633 --> 01:09:22.253
- It looks like you're just...
- Does his power have a name?

1421
01:09:22.278 --> 01:09:25.153
Please, hold your questions
until I'm done breaking this thing!

1422
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:27.457
Just let me do this!

1423
01:09:27.482 --> 01:09:28.089
Oi!

1424
01:09:41.250 --> 01:09:41.730
Hobie!

1425
01:09:41.947 --> 01:09:43.487
Hobie, my guy!

1426
01:09:43.512 --> 01:09:43.884
Hobie?

1427
01:09:43.909 --> 01:09:44.911
Look at that. Another one.

1428
01:09:44.936 --> 01:09:47.608
I love how many different variations of you guys there are. I mean...

1429
01:09:47.633 --> 01:09:49.458
My left palm, big step up!

1430
01:09:49.483 --> 01:09:50.020
You got me?

1431
01:09:50.045 --> 01:09:50.947
What's this dude saying?

1432
01:09:50.972 --> 01:09:54.519
It's English for "we get along great
and we're close friends"!

1433
01:09:54.544 --> 01:09:55.926
Is this the other one, from 1610?

1434
01:09:55.951 --> 01:09:57.049
- Do you understand this guy?
- Huh.

1435
01:09:57.074 --> 01:09:59.367
Hey, Hobie! Thanks for breaking the shield!

1436
01:09:59.392 --> 01:10:00.438
I loosened it.

1437
01:10:00.463 --> 01:10:01.440
Bit of advice:

1438
01:10:01.465 --> 01:10:03.022
Use the palm, not just your fingers.

1439
01:10:04.374 --> 01:10:05.307
Also, your suit.

1440
01:10:05.332 --> 01:10:06.520
Is he bleeding from his armpits?

1441
01:10:06.545 --> 01:10:07.760
Miles, Hobie. Hobie, Miles.

1442
01:10:07.785 --> 01:10:10.734
Hi. I've never heard of you, because Gwen barely ever mentioned you.

1443
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:13.156
Hi, my name's Hobie. Hobie Brown.

1444
01:10:13.181 --> 01:10:15.015
I was bitten by a...wouldn't you like to know?

1445
01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:15.829
Yeah, I'm here.

1446
01:10:15.854 --> 01:10:18.072
And for the last three years, I've been the one and only--wait, wait.

1447
01:10:18.097 --> 01:10:18.778
Hang on, wait, wait.

1448
01:10:19.452 --> 01:10:20.960
Think I'm gonna show you my secret identity?

1449
01:10:20.985 --> 01:10:21.865
Come out of it!

1450
01:10:21.890 --> 01:10:24.848
That is, when I'm not playing shows, antagonizing fascists,

1451
01:10:24.879 --> 01:10:28.157
staging unpermitted political action-slash-performance art pieces,

1452
01:10:28.182 --> 01:10:28.593
Or,

1453
01:10:28.618 --> 01:10:30.246
having a laugh at a pub in...

1454
01:10:30.271 --> 01:10:31.157
I'm not a role model.

1455
01:10:31.182 --> 01:10:32.677
I was briefly a runway model.

1456
01:10:32.702 --> 01:10:34.523
I hate the AM, I hate the PM,

1457
01:10:34.548 --> 01:10:35.429
I hate labels,

1458
01:10:35.454 --> 01:10:36.435
I'm not a hero,

1459
01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:39.261
'cuz calling yourself a "hero" makes you a self-mythologizing,

1460
01:10:39.286 --> 01:10:40.892
narcissistic autocrat.

1461
01:10:40.917 --> 01:10:42.409
Oh, I thought you hated labels.

1462
01:10:42.702 --> 01:10:44.569
Gwendy, you left your jumper around my place.

1463
01:10:44.594 --> 01:10:45.212
What's a jumper?

1464
01:10:45.237 --> 01:10:46.306
It's a sweater.

1465
01:10:46.331 --> 01:10:47.745
How many sweaters do you have?

1466
01:10:47.770 --> 01:10:49.614
Uh--that's...that's not my nature.

1467
01:10:49.639 --> 01:10:50.454
And your toothbrush.

1468
01:10:50.479 --> 01:10:51.442
Wait, what?

1469
01:10:52.105 --> 01:10:52.937
Are those my chucks?

1470
01:10:56.030 --> 01:10:57.418
Y'all make a heck of a team.

1471
01:10:57.443 --> 01:10:58.565
I don't believe in teams.

1472
01:10:58.590 --> 01:10:59.796
Aren't you in a band?

1473
01:10:59.821 --> 01:11:01.272
I don't believe in consistency.

1474
01:11:01.597 --> 01:11:03.023
This guy is killing me.

1475
01:11:03.378 --> 01:11:03.993
Ahh!

1476
01:11:04.957 --> 01:11:06.567
This is gonna be good for us, Spiderman.

1477
01:11:08.297 --> 01:11:10.883
You and me are finally gonna live up to our potential.

1478
01:11:11.449 --> 01:11:13.741
You'll finally have a villain worth fighting,

1479
01:11:13.766 --> 01:11:15.793
and I won't be just a joke to you!

1480
01:11:24.611 --> 01:11:25.091
[Spot grunts]

1481
01:11:25.565 --> 01:11:27.305
You're not a joke! Right, gang?

1482
01:11:27.330 --> 01:11:30.064
- Absolutely!
- Completely unamusing!
- I don't believe in comedy!

1483
01:11:30.907 --> 01:11:31.809
Just kidding!

1484
01:11:31.834 --> 01:11:32.721
See?

1485
01:11:32.746 --> 01:11:34.438
No one here thinks you're a joke!

1486
01:11:34.463 --> 01:11:35.431
They won't after this.

1487
01:11:36.004 --> 01:11:36.804
No!

1488
01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:44.657
Well, that was another easy adventure

1489
01:11:44.696 --> 01:11:45.435
- for Spiderman!
- No, no, no!!

1490
01:12:03.813 --> 01:12:05.073
I'm coming!

1491
01:12:08.762 --> 01:12:10.055
Huh...

1492
01:12:15.446 --> 01:12:16.626
What was that?

1493
01:12:19.658 --> 01:12:20.605
Our future.

1494
01:12:22.713 --> 01:12:24.626
I'm gonna take everything from you.

1495
01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:27.407
Like you took everything from me.

1496
01:12:29.271 --> 01:12:30.144
What?

1497
01:12:30.679 --> 01:12:32.339
-See you back home...

1498
01:12:32.876 --> 01:12:34.216
Spiderman.

1499
01:12:37.724 --> 01:12:39.530
Miles? Miles!

1500
01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:50.180
Everyone...

1501
01:13:03.467 --> 01:13:04.920
We'll clear the path,

1502
01:13:04.945 --> 01:13:06.511
you slow down that building!

1503
01:13:06.804 --> 01:13:08.831
I'll do it, but not because you told me to.

1504
01:13:16.965 --> 01:13:18.025
Everybody, run!

1505
01:14:16.050 --> 01:14:16.983
No!

1506
01:14:26.933 --> 01:14:27.833
Gwen, heads up.

1507
01:14:27.858 --> 01:14:29.880
Markers are predicting an incoming canon event,

1508
01:14:29.905 --> 01:14:30.839
so tread carefully.

1509
01:14:31.289 --> 01:14:32.389
I'm on it.

1510
01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:35.986
Somebody help!

1511
01:14:36.011 --> 01:14:37.452
- Hurry, everyone! This way, quickly!
- Help!

1512
01:14:44.092 --> 01:14:45.352
Inspector Singh!

1513
01:14:50.942 --> 01:14:53.095
I can do both...!

1514
01:14:55.176 --> 01:14:56.542
Where's your...

1515
01:14:56.864 --> 01:14:58.034
I got him, I got him!

1516
01:14:58.059 --> 01:14:58.835
Miles!

1517
01:14:59.128 --> 01:15:01.128
Don't worry. Thread the needle, ring the bell, right?

1518
01:15:01.153 --> 01:15:02.045
It's too dangerous.

1519
01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:03.618
I'll be okay, I--I promise.

1520
01:15:03.643 --> 01:15:05.181
Miles! No!

1521
01:15:19.633 --> 01:15:21.352
Miles!

1522
01:15:21.377 --> 01:15:21.869
No!

1523
01:15:21.894 --> 01:15:23.476
No, no, no, no...oh...

1524
01:15:25.805 --> 01:15:26.938
Please, no!

1525
01:15:26.963 --> 01:15:27.741
Miles?

1526
01:15:27.766 --> 01:15:28.986
Come on!

1527
01:15:34.671 --> 01:15:35.531
You're alright!

1528
01:15:36.259 --> 01:15:37.072
I promised.

1529
01:15:42.762 --> 01:15:43.722
Oh!

1530
01:15:43.747 --> 01:15:45.188
Are you okay? I was so worried!

1531
01:15:45.213 --> 01:15:46.481
I mean...

1532
01:15:46.506 --> 01:15:49.540
You seem like a nice young woman that I do not know!

1533
01:15:50.157 --> 01:15:50.985
Papa!

1534
01:15:51.010 --> 01:15:51.992
Gayatri!

1535
01:15:54.456 --> 01:15:55.149
Papa?

1536
01:15:56.791 --> 01:15:57.777
Not bad, right?

1537
01:16:02.109 --> 01:16:02.708
Right.

1538
01:16:04.667 --> 01:16:07.200
I have never seen him so emotional!

1539
01:16:07.225 --> 01:16:08.152
Excellent job.

1540
01:16:18.547 --> 01:16:20.587
Done, done!

1541
01:16:20.612 --> 01:16:22.706
Miles, my guy!

1542
01:16:34.588 --> 01:16:35.530
So?

1543
01:16:35.555 --> 01:16:36.248
Whaddya think?

1544
01:16:37.354 --> 01:16:38.454
What I always think.

1545
01:16:39.645 --> 01:16:40.591
You're amazing.

1546
01:16:42.252 --> 01:16:44.052
We...make a good team.

1547
01:16:45.081 --> 01:16:45.581
Yeah?

1548
01:16:46.742 --> 01:16:47.336
Yeah.

1549
01:16:53.945 --> 01:16:55.631
[Pavitr] Guys, what's that?

1550
01:16:57.026 --> 01:16:58.440
It's a metaphor for capitalism.

1551
01:17:00.934 --> 01:17:02.087
It's a lot worse than that.

1552
01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:11.548
Okay, guys. Secure the area, clear all civilians,

1553
01:17:11.572 --> 01:17:13.327
and let's contain this quantum hole.

1554
01:17:13.352 --> 01:17:14.439
Hey, I'm Miles. Uh...

1555
01:17:14.464 --> 01:17:16.863
We actually met before. When I was invisible.

1556
01:17:16.888 --> 01:17:18.071
I know who you are.

1557
01:17:21.627 --> 01:17:23.385
Is everything going to be okay?

1558
01:17:32.087 --> 01:17:32.799
Okay...

1559
01:17:32.824 --> 01:17:35.377
-let me--let me explain.
-Miguel wants you back at HQ.

1560
01:17:35.402 --> 01:17:36.638
Miles was just about to head out, for...

1561
01:17:36.663 --> 01:17:37.917
All of you.

1562
01:17:37.942 --> 01:17:39.650
I don't follow orders. Neither does he.

1563
01:17:39.675 --> 01:17:40.855
I'm invited to HQ?

1564
01:17:41.415 --> 01:17:42.275
Whoo!

1565
01:17:56.559 --> 01:17:58.892
How are you even cooler under your mask?

1566
01:17:59.263 --> 01:18:00.716
I was just cool the whole time.

1567
01:18:08.902 --> 01:18:09.774
Dang.

1568
01:18:17.493 --> 01:18:18.310
Hey.

1569
01:18:18.335 --> 01:18:19.095
Over here.

1570
01:18:24.829 --> 01:18:26.075
Yo!

1571
01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:27.475
This place is wild!

1572
01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:28.395
Any sign of Spot?

1573
01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:29.247
Let me ask.

1574
01:18:29.272 --> 01:18:31.274
Hey, anybody spot Spot?

1575
01:18:31.299 --> 01:18:33.249
Oh, so funny. Anybody else got jokes?

1576
01:18:33.274 --> 01:18:34.373
Now that you mention it...

1577
01:18:38.734 --> 01:18:40.540
This is unbelievable!

1578
01:18:40.565 --> 01:18:41.797
This is the lobby.

1579
01:18:42.217 --> 01:18:42.710
Oh.

1580
01:18:43.332 --> 01:18:46.618
Welcome to Spider society!

1581
01:18:55.813 --> 01:18:57.093
Bit much, innit?

1582
01:18:57.725 --> 01:19:00.472
What happened to that small elite strike team?

1583
01:19:00.497 --> 01:19:01.582
A lot of these are part-time.

1584
01:19:03.493 --> 01:19:04.946
Gwendy, how much have you told him?

1585
01:19:05.350 --> 01:19:07.077
Hmm? About his place in all this.

1586
01:19:07.405 --> 01:19:07.925
A little.

1587
01:19:09.277 --> 01:19:09.950
Ahh. [pants]

1588
01:19:09.975 --> 01:19:10.771
Maybe not enough.

1589
01:19:11.410 --> 01:19:12.064
Here.

1590
01:19:12.641 --> 01:19:14.401
Oh! My own watch!

1591
01:19:14.426 --> 01:19:15.836
- It's a day pass.
- Oh.

1592
01:19:15.861 --> 01:19:16.705
This just keeps you from-

1593
01:19:18.426 --> 01:19:19.220
...doing that.

1594
01:19:19.932 --> 01:19:21.225
Hup, hup, hup!

1595
01:19:21.250 --> 01:19:22.665
- Hey, Gwen!
- Hey, Peter.

1596
01:19:23.402 --> 01:19:25.202
- Hey, I'm Miles.
- Hey, Gwen.
- Hi, Gwen.

1597
01:19:25.227 --> 01:19:26.271
Hey, Peters.

1598
01:19:26.296 --> 01:19:27.380
I'm, uh...I'm a new recruit.

1599
01:19:27.405 --> 01:19:31.125
Peter, take a team to the transport
deck to help deal with this Spot mess.

1600
01:19:31.847 --> 01:19:33.507
I wouldn't call it a mess.

1601
01:19:33.532 --> 01:19:35.618
More like a...success in progress.

1602
01:19:35.643 --> 01:19:36.165
Ben, I need-

1603
01:19:36.190 --> 01:19:38.352
Sorry. I can't talk right now.

1604
01:19:39.031 --> 01:19:41.838
- Thinking about my past.
- Actually, we need you here, for some reason.

1605
01:19:43.209 --> 01:19:45.397
That was a particularly...harrowing memory.

1606
01:19:45.422 --> 01:19:46.082
Is...is he okay?

1607
01:19:46.107 --> 01:19:47.079
Ahh!

1608
01:19:47.104 --> 01:19:49.104
Hey. The name's Web-Slinger.

1609
01:19:49.129 --> 01:19:51.166
Why does the horse need a mask?

1610
01:19:51.191 --> 01:19:52.919
To conceal her face.

1611
01:19:53.133 --> 01:19:54.747
Giddy...up!

1612
01:19:55.918 --> 01:19:57.794
Who is in these laser cages?

1613
01:19:57.819 --> 01:20:00.112
Anomalies. Folks who wound up in the wrong dimension.

1614
01:20:00.137 --> 01:20:02.067
We kick their butts, and send 'em home!

1615
01:20:02.092 --> 01:20:02.960
They're not very interesting.

1616
01:20:02.985 --> 01:20:03.400
What?

1617
01:20:03.425 --> 01:20:05.302
- We got a bunch'a Doc Ocs.
- Well, that's interesting!

1618
01:20:05.327 --> 01:20:06.714
- A Mysterio,
- Ooh.

1619
01:20:06.739 --> 01:20:07.672
a Missterio.

1620
01:20:07.697 --> 01:20:08.767
- Wow!
- Video game guy,

1621
01:20:08.792 --> 01:20:10.014
-I love video games!

1622
01:20:10.039 --> 01:20:11.229
another video game guy...

1623
01:20:11.254 --> 01:20:12.278
Are you talking to me?

1624
01:20:12.303 --> 01:20:13.472
Typeface.

1625
01:20:13.497 --> 01:20:15.702
Go to Helvetica, Spiderman!

1626
01:20:15.727 --> 01:20:16.134
Bold.

1627
01:20:16.159 --> 01:20:17.558
An interesting Kraven,

1628
01:20:17.583 --> 01:20:18.979
a boring rhino,

1629
01:20:19.004 --> 01:20:20.084
a Prowler,

1630
01:20:20.109 --> 01:20:21.120
Prowler?

1631
01:20:21.145 --> 01:20:21.844
Not your Prowler.

1632
01:20:23.185 --> 01:20:23.924
Hey.

1633
01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:25.880
Hey.

1634
01:20:29.285 --> 01:20:30.765
It's rude to stare.

1635
01:20:30.790 --> 01:20:32.316
- Caught that one myself.
- I slipped.

1636
01:20:32.341 --> 01:20:34.064
You? Okay, I did all the work.

1637
01:20:34.089 --> 01:20:35.606
-You...
-How many missions have you been on together?

1638
01:20:35.631 --> 01:20:36.914
- Oh, not that many.
- Couple dozen.

1639
01:20:37.567 --> 01:20:38.380
That's cool.

1640
01:20:38.405 --> 01:20:39.240
Sorry.

1641
01:20:41.728 --> 01:20:42.648
I'm Spiderman.

1642
01:20:42.673 --> 01:20:43.969
Wow, no way!

1643
01:20:43.994 --> 01:20:44.910
All of us are.

1644
01:20:44.935 --> 01:20:46.360
Can we just keep moving?

1645
01:20:46.385 --> 01:20:47.278
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1646
01:20:47.303 --> 01:20:48.100
What are you?

1647
01:20:48.125 --> 01:20:49.240
I'm an avatar!

1648
01:20:49.848 --> 01:20:53.966
My body is back in my parents' dimension,
chilling in my game chair, and eating Fritos.

1649
01:20:53.991 --> 01:20:56.067
Surprising! You don't listen!

1650
01:20:56.092 --> 01:20:57.697
Here is...better.

1651
01:20:57.722 --> 01:20:58.763
Hear that.

1652
01:21:01.307 --> 01:21:02.685
What does that do?

1653
01:21:02.710 --> 01:21:04.079
Apart from having a great name?

1654
01:21:04.104 --> 01:21:04.946
Go Home Machine.

1655
01:21:04.971 --> 01:21:06.073
What'd I say, eh?

1656
01:21:06.098 --> 01:21:06.938
I voted against it.

1657
01:21:07.298 --> 01:21:09.918
It detects whatever dimension your DNA is from,

1658
01:21:09.943 --> 01:21:11.549
and sends you there.

1659
01:21:11.877 --> 01:21:14.016
Super humane, and not creepy.

1660
01:21:15.188 --> 01:21:17.071
-See you, guy! Don't come back!

1661
01:21:19.590 --> 01:21:20.934
We should go. We don't wanna keep Miguel...

1662
01:21:20.959 --> 01:21:22.332
I'll...s-see you around?

1663
01:21:22.357 --> 01:21:23.069
Let's go!

1664
01:21:23.094 --> 01:21:24.589
-Hey, good luck out there, man.
-Whoa! Whoa.

1665
01:21:24.614 --> 01:21:25.562
Okay, bye!

1666
01:21:25.587 --> 01:21:26.820
Miguel sounds hangry.

1667
01:21:26.845 --> 01:21:28.970
He likes those empanadas from the cafeteria.

1668
01:21:32.053 --> 01:21:33.793
My name is Miguel O'Hara.

1669
01:21:36.155 --> 01:21:38.755
I'm this dimension's one and only Spiderman.

1670
01:21:41.115 --> 01:21:42.228
Or, at least I was.

1671
01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:47.467
But I'm not like the others.

1672
01:21:50.132 --> 01:21:52.485
I don't always like what I have to do.

1673
01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:55.467
But I know I have to be the one to do it.

1674
01:21:57.143 --> 01:21:59.510
I've given up too much to stop now.

1675
01:22:02.284 --> 01:22:03.704
Hoo, yo!

1676
01:22:04.955 --> 01:22:06.491
Bet this doesn't even do anything.

1677
01:22:06.516 --> 01:22:08.922
Maybe it did, before you ripped it out of a wall!

1678
01:22:08.954 --> 01:22:10.535
Propaganda, bro.

1679
01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:12.032
It'll distract you from the truth.

1680
01:22:12.057 --> 01:22:13.721
And what's that?

1681
01:22:13.987 --> 01:22:15.180
I ain't got a Scooby Doo, mate.

1682
01:22:15.511 --> 01:22:16.678
'Cuz that's what they want.

1683
01:22:21.827 --> 01:22:23.467
Why do you wanna be a part of this stuff?

1684
01:22:23.795 --> 01:22:25.249
To get a watch.

1685
01:22:25.274 --> 01:22:26.197
Make your own watch.

1686
01:22:26.222 --> 01:22:27.270
Pshh.

1687
01:22:27.295 --> 01:22:29.530
Bet you--bet you got a nice setup, huh? Nice parents?

1688
01:22:29.555 --> 01:22:30.345
They're fine.

1689
01:22:30.927 --> 01:22:32.613
I mean, we got in a fight, but...

1690
01:22:33.859 --> 01:22:35.972
they just want what's best for me. So...

1691
01:22:36.270 --> 01:22:37.196
That's a bloody shame.

1692
01:22:38.022 --> 01:22:38.889
Why?

1693
01:22:40.104 --> 01:22:41.891
'Cuz you're not ready for everybody else.

1694
01:22:50.852 --> 01:22:51.445
Get down.

1695
01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:55.220
Listen to me, bruv.

1696
01:22:56.148 --> 01:22:58.148
-The whole point of being Spiderman is your independence.

1697
01:22:58.173 --> 01:23:00.061
Being your own boss, you don't need all this!

1698
01:23:00.086 --> 01:23:01.216
Then why are you here?

1699
01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:03.452
Looking out for my drummer, is all.

1700
01:23:03.477 --> 01:23:04.826
I want to be in a band.

1701
01:23:04.851 --> 01:23:07.181
I...I wanna see my friends, and...

1702
01:23:07.206 --> 01:23:08.687
I need a watch to do that.

1703
01:23:08.712 --> 01:23:10.444
Guys, come on.

1704
01:23:10.469 --> 01:23:12.370
Alright. Squashed.

1705
01:23:13.407 --> 01:23:15.647
Just don't enlist until you know about who you're fighting.

1706
01:23:38.926 --> 01:23:40.219
Yeah, I know. It's slow.

1707
01:23:40.970 --> 01:23:42.463
But...it's his thing.

1708
01:23:43.976 --> 01:23:45.349
Miguel O'Hara?

1709
01:23:45.374 --> 01:23:47.197
-Meet Miles Morales.
-[laughs]

1710
01:23:47.222 --> 01:23:48.997
Hey! ¿Qué tal, tío?

1711
01:23:49.568 --> 01:23:50.871
I speak Spanish.

1712
01:23:51.982 --> 01:23:54.115
Te traje una empanada-

1713
01:23:55.298 --> 01:23:56.185
Qué maravilla.

1714
01:24:00.075 --> 01:24:02.561
- That's not--I'm really excited to get going. I got some...
- Oh? Great.

1715
01:24:02.586 --> 01:24:04.332
fresh new ideas on how to catch the Spot.

1716
01:24:04.357 --> 01:24:06.340
- He just wants to be taken seriously.
- Oh, wow! Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

1717
01:24:07.217 --> 01:24:07.749
Whoa!

1718
01:24:08.005 --> 01:24:09.749
He's worried about Spot.

1719
01:24:09.774 --> 01:24:11.132
I'll worry about Spot!

1720
01:24:11.157 --> 01:24:11.837
What did I do?

1721
01:24:11.861 --> 01:24:13.848
Miguel! It's not his fault!

1722
01:24:13.873 --> 01:24:15.079
Fault? Hold up.

1723
01:24:15.104 --> 01:24:16.534
You blew another hole in the multiverse!

1724
01:24:16.559 --> 01:24:17.878
He doesn't know any better!

1725
01:24:17.903 --> 01:24:19.698
I do know--what...uhh, not know...

1726
01:24:19.723 --> 01:24:21.350
But you did, Gwen.

1727
01:24:22.091 --> 01:24:22.998
And you...

1728
01:24:23.998 --> 01:24:25.386
I was gonna try and ignore you.

1729
01:24:25.411 --> 01:24:27.065
-I just can't, with you.
-I'm not even here.

1730
01:24:28.069 --> 01:24:28.942
Not really.

1731
01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:30.127
What's happening?

1732
01:24:30.152 --> 01:24:31.533
Hey, Miguel!

1733
01:24:31.791 --> 01:24:34.031
Come on, go easy on the kid.

1734
01:24:34.429 --> 01:24:36.715
He had a terrible teacher!

1735
01:24:37.988 --> 01:24:39.288
He had no chance!

1736
01:24:39.313 --> 01:24:41.202
-Peter! Peter?
- Oh boy!

1737
01:24:41.227 --> 01:24:43.825
Humbling reality Spiderman has arrived.

1738
01:24:43.850 --> 01:24:45.301
-Miles!
-Dude!

1739
01:24:45.326 --> 01:24:46.833
Don't be afraid of my friend Miguel,

1740
01:24:46.857 --> 01:24:48.905
he just looks scary. He's got no bite.

1741
01:24:48.930 --> 01:24:49.684
Peter.

1742
01:24:49.709 --> 01:24:51.637
-You're growing up on me! You look great!

1743
01:24:51.662 --> 01:24:52.802
Ehh...

1744
01:24:52.827 --> 01:24:55.336
-You look solid. Y'know? You look good.
-Define solid.

1745
01:24:55.361 --> 01:24:57.318
What happened? You bleeding from the armpits?

1746
01:24:57.343 --> 01:24:59.993
- Peter, you...
- Don't worry about the suit. We'll get you a new suit.

1747
01:25:00.018 --> 01:25:01.677
Peter, you gotta tell him...

1748
01:25:01.702 --> 01:25:02.464
Wait...

1749
01:25:02.489 --> 01:25:03.675
What is that?

1750
01:25:03.700 --> 01:25:04.308
Mayday!

1751
01:25:04.333 --> 01:25:06.690
-You have a baby! This is crazy!
-I have a baby.

1752
01:25:06.715 --> 01:25:09.115
Don't forget to keep your little day pass on, honey!

1753
01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:10.030
Oh, you have one, too.

1754
01:25:10.055 --> 01:25:11.798
I didn't know they made those for adults.

1755
01:25:11.823 --> 01:25:13.419
Gimme a second. Mayday!

1756
01:25:13.444 --> 01:25:15.036
Kid's an anarchist.

1757
01:25:15.061 --> 01:25:17.899
I'm coming up to get you! Here I come!

1758
01:25:20.007 --> 01:25:22.783
Ha! I knew I was gonna regret
making her that web shooter.

1759
01:25:22.808 --> 01:25:24.898
I shouldn't have done it. That's an actual mistake.

1760
01:25:26.075 --> 01:25:26.793
Wanna see pictures?

1761
01:25:26.818 --> 01:25:28.179
-I mean, she's right there, so...
-Look at this pic!

1762
01:25:28.204 --> 01:25:31.560
-Oh! You've got...okay, uh, wow.
-Look at this special kid! Oh, she's incredible!
-Mm-hmm.

1763
01:25:31.585 --> 01:25:32.923
- Yup.
- This is her funny face.
- Mm-hmm.

1764
01:25:32.948 --> 01:25:34.603
Oh, that's her mad face.

1765
01:25:34.628 --> 01:25:36.407
This one is the studious one.

1766
01:25:36.432 --> 01:25:38.969
Watch out, the next one, you're gonna crack up! You're gonna crack up.

1767
01:25:38.994 --> 01:25:40.929
Oh, Miguel's gonna die.

1768
01:25:40.954 --> 01:25:42.243
Miguel! Miguel, look at this one.

1769
01:25:42.268 --> 01:25:44.357
I'm trying to hold a serious adult conversation, here.

1770
01:25:44.382 --> 01:25:46.196
You know, you're the only Spiderman who isn't funny.

1771
01:25:46.220 --> 01:25:47.531
We're supposed to be funny!

1772
01:25:47.556 --> 01:25:48.841
The fate of the multiverse...

1773
01:25:48.866 --> 01:25:50.521
You always lose me with that!

1774
01:25:50.546 --> 01:25:53.009
You say, "the fate of the multiverse",

1775
01:25:53.034 --> 01:25:54.854
...and my brain dies!

1776
01:25:54.879 --> 01:25:56.285
We are--

1777
01:25:56.310 --> 01:25:58.155
You guys smell that? Mayday took a crap.

1778
01:25:58.180 --> 01:25:59.349
Yup! She's a Parker.

1779
01:25:59.374 --> 01:26:01.199
- That's what happens when a Parker eats an avocado.
- Miles.

1780
01:26:01.224 --> 01:26:02.774
You disrupted a canon event.

1781
01:26:02.799 --> 01:26:03.532
Canon event?

1782
01:26:03.557 --> 01:26:05.093
The kid wasn't thinking!

1783
01:26:05.118 --> 01:26:06.580
That's not how he works!

1784
01:26:06.605 --> 01:26:07.659
That's insulting.

1785
01:26:07.684 --> 01:26:10.057
Taking a crap on the establishment. I salute you.

1786
01:26:10.082 --> 01:26:11.818
Wait, what are you upset about?

1787
01:26:11.843 --> 01:26:13.258
I saved those people.

1788
01:26:13.283 --> 01:26:14.395
And that's the problem.

1789
01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:18.093
Lyla? Do the thing.

1790
01:26:18.118 --> 01:26:19.438
Huh? What thing?

1791
01:26:19.463 --> 01:26:20.433
What--what do you mean, "what thing"?

1792
01:26:20.457 --> 01:26:22.353
The information explaining thing!

1793
01:26:22.378 --> 01:26:23.200
...Okay.

1794
01:26:29.748 --> 01:26:31.022
What's this?

1795
01:26:31.986 --> 01:26:34.246
This...is everything.

1796
01:26:39.990 --> 01:26:41.864
Can you be more specific?

1797
01:26:41.889 --> 01:26:44.211
Can you not talk for a second?

1798
01:26:44.236 --> 01:26:44.957
Yeah, yeah.

1799
01:26:46.098 --> 01:26:47.458
This, here...

1800
01:26:48.807 --> 01:26:50.193
This is all of us.

1801
01:26:50.759 --> 01:26:53.905
All of our lives woven together,

1802
01:26:53.930 --> 01:26:57.177
in a beautiful web of life and destiny.

1803
01:26:57.998 --> 01:26:59.445
The Spiderverse.

1804
01:26:59.470 --> 01:27:00.433
The Spiderverse?

1805
01:27:00.988 --> 01:27:02.289
Huh, that's...

1806
01:27:02.313 --> 01:27:03.074
stupid.

1807
01:27:03.868 --> 01:27:06.302
It's called the Arachno-Humanoid Poly-Multiverse.

1808
01:27:07.499 --> 01:27:08.446
Which sounds...

1809
01:27:09.115 --> 01:27:10.348
stupid too, I guess.

1810
01:27:11.709 --> 01:27:14.509
And these nodes, where the minds converge?

1811
01:27:15.087 --> 01:27:16.447
-They are the canon.

1812
01:27:17.042 --> 01:27:21.309
-Chapters that are a part of every Spider's story, every time.

1813
01:27:22.071 --> 01:27:23.498
Some good...

1814
01:27:24.704 --> 01:27:25.658
some bad...

1815
01:27:28.226 --> 01:27:29.340
some very bad.

1816
01:27:37.424 --> 01:27:38.661
Just keep going.

1817
01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:40.207
Uncle Aaron...

1818
01:27:41.094 --> 01:27:44.041
This one, event ASM-90,

1819
01:27:44.792 --> 01:27:47.539
a police captain close to Spiderman dies

1820
01:27:47.564 --> 01:27:51.361
saving a kid from falling rubble during a battle with an arch-nemesis.

1821
01:27:52.287 --> 01:27:53.361
Captain Stacy...

1822
01:27:54.692 --> 01:27:55.719
I'm so sorry.

1823
01:28:19.298 --> 01:28:21.024
That happened to you?

1824
01:28:22.708 --> 01:28:24.015
And me.

1825
01:28:27.937 --> 01:28:29.391
Eh? What of it?

1826
01:28:30.185 --> 01:28:32.478
That's how the story's supposed to go.

1827
01:28:33.693 --> 01:28:35.920
The canon events are the connections

1828
01:28:35.945 --> 01:28:38.185
that bind our lives together.

1829
01:28:38.869 --> 01:28:41.289
And those connections can be broken.

1830
01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:45.168
That's why anomalies...

1831
01:28:45.988 --> 01:28:47.141
are so dangerous.

1832
01:28:48.210 --> 01:28:50.876
Inspector Singh's death was a canon event.

1833
01:28:50.901 --> 01:28:53.035
You weren't supposed to be there,

1834
01:28:53.060 --> 01:28:55.476
and you weren't supposed to save him.

1835
01:28:56.071 --> 01:28:57.662
That's why Gwen tried to stop you.

1836
01:28:58.060 --> 01:28:58.833
-Miles!

1837
01:28:59.126 --> 01:29:00.920
I thought you were trying to save me.

1838
01:29:02.817 --> 01:29:04.431
I was. I...

1839
01:29:05.832 --> 01:29:07.146
I was doing both.

1840
01:29:07.933 --> 01:29:09.786
And now, Miles,

1841
01:29:10.318 --> 01:29:12.552
because you changed the story,

1842
01:29:12.577 --> 01:29:14.987
Pavitr's dimension is unraveling.

1843
01:29:15.895 --> 01:29:18.454
If we're lucky...we can stop it.

1844
01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:21.767
We haven't always been lucky.

1845
01:29:21.792 --> 01:29:23.194
That--that wasn't me.

1846
01:29:23.219 --> 01:29:24.241
That was the Spot!

1847
01:29:24.266 --> 01:29:26.656
It's what happens when you break the canon.

1848
01:29:29.244 --> 01:29:30.191
How do you know?

1849
01:29:31.196 --> 01:29:33.290
Because I broke it once myself.

1850
01:29:34.329 --> 01:29:37.249
I found another world where I had a family.

1851
01:29:37.985 --> 01:29:39.238
Where I was happy.

1852
01:29:40.413 --> 01:29:42.220
At least, a version of me was.

1853
01:29:43.651 --> 01:29:46.491
And that version of myself was killed.

1854
01:29:51.722 --> 01:29:53.575
So I replaced him.

1855
01:29:56.373 --> 01:29:58.213
I thought it was harmless.

1856
01:30:01.808 --> 01:30:02.935
But I was wrong.

1857
01:30:13.308 --> 01:30:15.080
Dad! Dad, help!

1858
01:30:20.207 --> 01:30:21.407
Isn't that right, Peter?

1859
01:30:22.669 --> 01:30:23.536
Yeah.

1860
01:30:24.609 --> 01:30:27.736
You break enough canon, you save enough captains,

1861
01:30:29.443 --> 01:30:31.643
and we could lose everything.

1862
01:30:43.694 --> 01:30:45.807
My dad is about to be captain.

1863
01:30:55.230 --> 01:30:56.043
No...

1864
01:30:58.590 --> 01:31:00.684
I'm going to take everything from you,

1865
01:31:02.545 --> 01:31:04.127
- Help!
- ...like you took everything from me.

1866
01:31:04.152 --> 01:31:05.127
I'm coming!

1867
01:31:09.676 --> 01:31:11.112
Spot does it.

1868
01:31:13.041 --> 01:31:14.201
He kills him.

1869
01:31:20.627 --> 01:31:22.887
When does it happen?

1870
01:31:26.317 --> 01:31:27.239
When does it happen?

1871
01:31:27.264 --> 01:31:28.472
In two days.

1872
01:31:29.613 --> 01:31:30.919
When he's sworn in.

1873
01:31:32.083 --> 01:31:33.943
That's...what the model says.

1874
01:31:36.086 --> 01:31:37.411
-I'm sorry, Miles.

1875
01:31:37.436 --> 01:31:38.442
Send me home!

1876
01:31:39.216 --> 01:31:40.163
I can't do that.

1877
01:31:40.538 --> 01:31:41.571
-Not now.

1878
01:31:41.978 --> 01:31:44.271
What am I supposed to do? Just let him die?!

1879
01:31:48.741 --> 01:31:49.981
What about your dad?

1880
01:31:50.345 --> 01:31:51.852
He's a captain. Right?

1881
01:31:54.251 --> 01:31:54.880
Yeah.

1882
01:31:55.741 --> 01:31:56.942
And that's it?

1883
01:31:56.966 --> 01:31:58.481
You just aren't gonna do anything about it?

1884
01:32:01.696 --> 01:32:03.515
Okay, what about Uncle Ben?

1885
01:32:03.540 --> 01:32:05.220
That'd've been okay, if you knew,

1886
01:32:05.245 --> 01:32:07.597
and you just...let it play out?!

1887
01:32:08.248 --> 01:32:10.680
If not for Uncle Ben,

1888
01:32:10.705 --> 01:32:13.425
most of us wouldn't be here, Miles.

1889
01:32:14.567 --> 01:32:16.501
And all the good we did, it...

1890
01:32:17.020 --> 01:32:18.673
it wouldn't have been done.

1891
01:32:21.962 --> 01:32:24.295
So we're just supposed to let people die,

1892
01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:26.144
-because some algorithm,
-Oh! Whoa!

1893
01:32:26.169 --> 01:32:27.939
says that that's supposed to happen?

1894
01:32:27.964 --> 01:32:30.609
You realize how messed up that sounds, right?

1895
01:32:30.634 --> 01:32:33.768
You have a choice between saving one person

1896
01:32:33.793 --> 01:32:35.760
and saving an entire world.

1897
01:32:35.785 --> 01:32:36.662
Every world!

1898
01:32:36.687 --> 01:32:37.862
I can do both!

1899
01:32:37.887 --> 01:32:40.401
- Spiderman always...
- Not always.

1900
01:32:44.148 --> 01:32:44.834
Miles.

1901
01:32:44.859 --> 01:32:47.195
We all want to live the life we wish we had.

1902
01:32:47.912 --> 01:32:50.403
Believe me, I have tried.

1903
01:32:50.428 --> 01:32:52.471
And the harder I tried,

1904
01:32:52.496 --> 01:32:54.229
the more damage I did.

1905
01:32:55.883 --> 01:32:57.190
You can't have it all, kid.

1906
01:33:01.860 --> 01:33:04.137
Being Spiderman is a sacrifice.

1907
01:33:04.798 --> 01:33:05.764
That's the job.

1908
01:33:06.535 --> 01:33:08.028
That's what you signed up for.

1909
01:33:09.004 --> 01:33:09.931
Miles...

1910
01:33:12.585 --> 01:33:13.384
Peni?

1911
01:33:15.182 --> 01:33:16.122
What is this?

1912
01:33:17.685 --> 01:33:19.539
Is this an intervention or something?

1913
01:33:20.353 --> 01:33:21.273
We know it's hard.

1914
01:33:22.805 --> 01:33:24.012
But it's the truth, Miles.

1915
01:33:24.908 --> 01:33:26.055
Is that why you're here?

1916
01:33:27.058 --> 01:33:28.391
To let me down easy?

1917
01:33:31.005 --> 01:33:32.979
-Worked last time, why not run it back, huh?

1918
01:33:33.004 --> 01:33:35.111
- Hey, hold on, hold on!
- You were right, Gwen.

1919
01:33:35.766 --> 01:33:37.805
-You should've never come to see me.

1920
01:33:37.830 --> 01:33:39.857
-Kid, look at me.
-Stop calling me that.

1921
01:33:39.882 --> 01:33:40.384
Here we go.

1922
01:33:40.409 --> 01:33:41.464
Hobie, you're not helping.

1923
01:33:41.489 --> 01:33:41.951
Good.

1924
01:33:42.742 --> 01:33:43.942
Miles, please understand...

1925
01:33:43.967 --> 01:33:46.054
You can't ask me not to save my father.

1926
01:33:46.531 --> 01:33:47.517
I'm not asking.

1927
01:33:48.063 --> 01:33:49.788
I got this, just--give him a second, please.

1928
01:33:49.815 --> 01:33:51.142
- That's a great look.
- Don't!

1929
01:33:52.044 --> 01:33:53.152
Stop it!

1930
01:33:53.177 --> 01:33:55.332
You let him leave, he'll only do more damage.

1931
01:33:55.357 --> 01:33:56.535
You both know that.

1932
01:33:57.509 --> 01:33:58.995
Just need to hold you a few days.

1933
01:33:59.386 --> 01:34:01.166
Sorry it had to end like this, kid.

1934
01:34:01.751 --> 01:34:03.005
I said...

1935
01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:04.550
not to call me that!

1936
01:34:16.788 --> 01:34:17.601
Miles!

1937
01:34:18.667 --> 01:34:21.045
Alright. I'm sorry for doing this.

1938
01:34:21.070 --> 01:34:22.645
This is bad parenting!

1939
01:34:23.434 --> 01:34:24.881
This is where I reckon I quit.

1940
01:34:30.123 --> 01:34:32.140
All stations, drop what you're doing

1941
01:34:32.164 --> 01:34:33.409
and stop Spiderman!

1942
01:34:34.518 --> 01:34:34.998
You?

1943
01:34:38.018 --> 01:34:39.930
Por Dios! Miles! Miles Morales!

1944
01:34:39.955 --> 01:34:41.358
He's entering Sector 4!

1945
01:34:45.555 --> 01:34:46.435
Is that him? Right?

1946
01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:49.154
Do I, uhh...have web on my face? What's the deal?

1947
01:34:49.179 --> 01:34:50.986
Miles! Lord--he's right there! He's right--

1948
01:34:51.011 --> 01:34:52.400
Turn around!

1949
01:34:52.425 --> 01:34:53.366
I don't see anything, boss.

1950
01:35:07.063 --> 01:35:07.523
Whoa!

1951
01:35:12.270 --> 01:35:14.323
Could this day get any damn weirder?!

1952
01:35:16.913 --> 01:35:17.386
Whoa!

1953
01:35:17.411 --> 01:35:18.439
I guess it can!

1954
01:35:25.379 --> 01:35:25.852
-Whoa!

1955
01:35:25.877 --> 01:35:26.479
Sorry!

1956
01:35:31.682 --> 01:35:33.728
And then I looked at my uncle, and...

1957
01:35:33.753 --> 01:35:35.128
Uhh, let me guess.

1958
01:35:35.153 --> 01:35:36.115
He died?

1959
01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:46.514
Whoa!

1960
01:35:48.567 --> 01:35:50.376
On the count of three, draw.

1961
01:35:50.401 --> 01:35:50.854
-One...

1962
01:35:51.087 --> 01:35:52.298
You didn't wait for three!

1963
01:35:52.323 --> 01:35:53.790
Hey, Miguel!

1964
01:35:53.815 --> 01:35:55.831
Would you take a photo of this? It's our first chase.

1965
01:35:57.092 --> 01:35:59.412
Yippi-ki-yay! Whoo!

1966
01:35:59.437 --> 01:36:01.550
Booooo!

1967
01:36:04.392 --> 01:36:05.045
Miles.

1968
01:36:05.070 --> 01:36:05.739
-Hi.

1969
01:36:06.389 --> 01:36:08.642
I'm a huge fan of your work.

1970
01:36:08.667 --> 01:36:08.977
-Thanks!

1971
01:36:09.002 --> 01:36:11.770
Do you think Spiderpeople too often use comedy as a crutch?

1972
01:36:11.795 --> 01:36:12.390
Uhhh...

1973
01:36:12.415 --> 01:36:13.547
Get it? Crutch?

1974
01:36:13.572 --> 01:36:14.160
Oof!

1975
01:36:14.654 --> 01:36:16.320
I can do anything you can!

1976
01:36:16.345 --> 01:36:17.856
Ohhh, dang! I pulled something!

1977
01:36:26.729 --> 01:36:27.529
Hello, Peter.

1978
01:36:27.554 --> 01:36:28.169
Whoa!

1979
01:36:44.396 --> 01:36:45.810
'Sup? There's nowhere to run.

1980
01:36:53.916 --> 01:36:56.316
My bad, everybody. There was somewhere to run.

1981
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.280
Stop running!

1982
01:37:06.305 --> 01:37:08.106
Then stop chasing me!

1983
01:37:08.604 --> 01:37:10.010
You're so frustrating!

1984
01:37:10.597 --> 01:37:12.290
I know he's your friend,

1985
01:37:12.315 --> 01:37:13.942
but it's the only way!

1986
01:37:13.967 --> 01:37:15.202
But my gut says-

1987
01:37:15.227 --> 01:37:16.597
Then use your head!

1988
01:37:26.456 --> 01:37:27.149
Oof!

1989
01:37:35.197 --> 01:37:37.207
This is called the sleeper hold!

1990
01:37:37.232 --> 01:37:39.441
I'm using my bicep to constrict your-

1991
01:37:54.107 --> 01:37:54.940
Ah!

1992
01:37:59.921 --> 01:38:00.941
Miles!

1993
01:38:01.388 --> 01:38:03.954
- No, no, no. Let me go!
- It is crazy to run!

1994
01:38:03.979 --> 01:38:06.723
Running is the least crazy thing going on!

1995
01:38:06.748 --> 01:38:08.203
I feel bad!

1996
01:38:08.228 --> 01:38:08.968
Good!

1997
01:38:08.993 --> 01:38:10.831
But this is just how stuff works!

1998
01:38:10.856 --> 01:38:12.398
You're not gonna win, here!

1999
01:38:12.423 --> 01:38:15.238
-No. No.
-Wait, don't move! Stop moving so fast!

2000
01:38:15.263 --> 01:38:15.933
No!

2001
01:38:15.958 --> 01:38:17.324
Do you wanna hold my baby?

2002
01:38:17.858 --> 01:38:18.284
What?

2003
01:38:18.309 --> 01:38:20.554
Would you just give the baby
one squeeze, and then we'll talk?

2004
01:38:20.579 --> 01:38:22.209
-Cuz I think it's gonna change our vibe.
-No!

2005
01:38:22.234 --> 01:38:23.534
It's very rejuvenating!

2006
01:38:23.559 --> 01:38:24.634
I'm plenty juvenated!

2007
01:38:24.659 --> 01:38:25.914
You'll get moreso

2008
01:38:25.939 --> 01:38:28.758
when you go chest to chest with this magical child!

2009
01:38:28.783 --> 01:38:30.432
You don't get to have a heartfelt

2010
01:38:30.456 --> 01:38:32.329
- conversation with me right now!
- Just hold the baby, we'll see what happens!

2011
01:38:34.932 --> 01:38:37.258
You're the reason I had her, okay?!

2012
01:38:38.657 --> 01:38:39.997
I thought...

2013
01:38:40.022 --> 01:38:42.195
that if I did a decent job raising her,

2014
01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:46.048
there was a chance she was gonna turn out like you.

2015
01:38:46.073 --> 01:38:49.399
And that got me excited, because
you are a wonderful person!

2016
01:38:49.967 --> 01:38:51.887
And I like being around you!

2017
01:38:53.482 --> 01:38:55.282
Then why didn't you come see me?

2018
01:38:56.297 --> 01:38:56.904
Be-...

2019
01:38:58.411 --> 01:38:59.237
I couldn't.

2020
01:39:00.498 --> 01:39:02.772
I wanted to be with you guys so badly.

2021
01:39:05.421 --> 01:39:07.624
But this thing isn't what I thought it was.

2022
01:39:07.649 --> 01:39:08.965
Look...

2023
01:39:08.990 --> 01:39:11.584
bad things are gonna happen.

2024
01:39:11.609 --> 01:39:13.789
It makes us who we are.

2025
01:39:14.695 --> 01:39:17.522
But good things happen too, you know?

2026
01:39:18.364 --> 01:39:20.157
Like you happened.

2027
01:39:21.928 --> 01:39:23.234
And she happened.

2028
01:39:24.569 --> 01:39:26.478
Hey! I don't...listen...

2029
01:39:26.503 --> 01:39:30.239
You are so bad at holding a baby!

2030
01:39:30.264 --> 01:39:31.401
We got your location, Peter.

2031
01:39:31.426 --> 01:39:32.811
- Inside the core.
- Wait! Wait, wait, wait, no! No, no!

2032
01:39:32.836 --> 01:39:34.983
You do not have my location! Over!

2033
01:39:35.008 --> 01:39:36.075
Send everyone.

2034
01:39:37.629 --> 01:39:38.789
-No, no, no! Look--Miles!

2035
01:39:38.814 --> 01:39:40.973
I didn't know! I promise you!

2036
01:39:40.998 --> 01:39:42.845
Please, man, let's talk about this.

2037
01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:43.766
We did.

2038
01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:47.523
Good talk.

2039
01:39:51.802 --> 01:39:52.736
Get him!

2040
01:40:01.625 --> 01:40:02.572
Ahh!

2041
01:40:05.573 --> 01:40:06.522
Miles!

2042
01:40:06.860 --> 01:40:09.527
- Where does he think he's going?
- I don't think he planned this out.

2043
01:40:09.815 --> 01:40:11.768
If I hadn't said it before, by the way,

2044
01:40:11.793 --> 01:40:13.818
you're a terrible mentor.

2045
01:40:22.511 --> 01:40:24.244
He did just beat you!

2046
01:40:24.269 --> 01:40:26.081
So I'm not a terrible mentor!

2047
01:40:26.106 --> 01:40:28.577
You're both equally terrible. Does that settle it?

2048
01:40:30.138 --> 01:40:32.599
Stop pretending you know what you're doing!

2049
01:40:32.624 --> 01:40:33.780
Oh, I have a plan.

2050
01:40:33.805 --> 01:40:35.646
I just...haven't told you yet!

2051
01:40:39.921 --> 01:40:40.454
Whoa!

2052
01:40:51.398 --> 01:40:52.898
Departing for the Web.

2053
01:40:52.923 --> 01:40:53.984
That's not good.

2054
01:41:12.635 --> 01:41:13.821
What are those, claws?

2055
01:41:13.846 --> 01:41:15.914
Dude, are you sure you're even Spiderman?

2056
01:41:16.850 --> 01:41:20.187
Are you? Who do you think you are? Really?

2057
01:41:23.370 --> 01:41:24.576
My name...

2058
01:41:24.601 --> 01:41:26.231
is Miles Morales.

2059
01:41:31.938 --> 01:41:34.431
I was bitten by a radioactive spider!

2060
01:41:36.350 --> 01:41:38.990
And I'm pretty sure you know the rest, sir!

2061
01:41:48.464 --> 01:41:49.291
'Sup, man?

2062
01:41:51.612 --> 01:41:52.658
I don't get it!

2063
01:41:52.683 --> 01:41:53.650
You're an anomaly!

2064
01:41:53.675 --> 01:41:56.010
Not if you let me go home!

2065
01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:00.340
Snitch!

2066
01:42:02.432 --> 01:42:04.742
Everywhere you go, you're an anomaly!

2067
01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:15.387
You're the original anomaly!

2068
01:42:19.041 --> 01:42:20.034
Miguel!

2069
01:42:20.750 --> 01:42:23.130
The spider that gave you your powers

2070
01:42:23.155 --> 01:42:24.804
wasn't from your dimension!

2071
01:42:26.476 --> 01:42:28.210
It was never supposed to bite you!

2072
01:42:29.218 --> 01:42:30.098
Miguel, don't!

2073
01:42:30.123 --> 01:42:33.177
There's a world out there with
no Spiderman to protect them,

2074
01:42:33.202 --> 01:42:34.733
because it bit you instead!

2075
01:42:34.758 --> 01:42:36.975
You're not supposed to be Spiderman!

2076
01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:37.695
No!

2077
01:42:37.721 --> 01:42:39.268
You're lying! I'm Spiderman!

2078
01:42:39.293 --> 01:42:40.321
You're a mistake!

2079
01:42:42.682 --> 01:42:44.308
If you hadn't been bit,

2080
01:42:44.333 --> 01:42:46.442
your Peter Parker would've lived!

2081
01:42:46.467 --> 01:42:48.941
Instead, he died, saving you.

2082
01:42:49.651 --> 01:42:52.498
-If you would've stopped the collider before it ever went off,

2083
01:42:52.523 --> 01:42:54.013
Spot wouldn't exist,

2084
01:42:54.038 --> 01:42:56.466
and none of this would've happened.

2085
01:42:56.491 --> 01:42:57.251
Aahh!

2086
01:42:57.276 --> 01:42:58.785
And all this time,

2087
01:42:58.810 --> 01:43:01.884
-I have been the only one holding it all together!
-Get off of me!

2088
01:43:01.909 --> 01:43:03.355
Miguel, go easy on him!

2089
01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:05.463
You don't belong here.

2090
01:43:05.488 --> 01:43:06.811
You never did.

2091
01:43:06.836 --> 01:43:08.607
Let me go!

2092
01:43:08.632 --> 01:43:09.401
Miguel, that's enough!

2093
01:43:09.426 --> 01:43:10.935
This isn't what we talked about!

2094
01:43:12.341 --> 01:43:13.901
You talked about this?

2095
01:43:15.322 --> 01:43:16.336
You knew?

2096
01:43:17.899 --> 01:43:19.765
-You...you all knew?

2097
01:43:20.843 --> 01:43:22.508
I...I didn't know...

2098
01:43:23.695 --> 01:43:24.561
how to tell you.

2099
01:43:26.691 --> 01:43:28.752
That's why you never came to see me.

2100
01:43:32.309 --> 01:43:34.329
Miles, it's for your own good!

2101
01:43:34.354 --> 01:43:35.459
Who decides that?!

2102
01:43:36.098 --> 01:43:37.685
I'm not a kid, Gwen!

2103
01:43:37.710 --> 01:43:38.401
Ah!

2104
01:43:38.426 --> 01:43:40.113
That's exactly what you are!

2105
01:43:40.138 --> 01:43:41.409
You're just a kid!

2106
01:43:41.434 --> 01:43:43.692
Who has no idea

2107
01:43:43.717 --> 01:43:45.151
what he's doing!

2108
01:43:50.623 --> 01:43:51.837
Yeah, well...

2109
01:43:51.862 --> 01:43:55.238
I did lure hundreds of Spiderpeople away from your little clubhouse.

2110
01:43:55.263 --> 01:43:55.636
Huh?

2111
01:44:01.733 --> 01:44:03.387
I guess he did plan this out!

2112
01:44:05.060 --> 01:44:06.109
And...

2113
01:44:06.134 --> 01:44:07.641
I'm about to do this.

2114
01:44:12.712 --> 01:44:16.906
Everyone keeps telling me how my story is supposed to go.

2115
01:44:17.818 --> 01:44:18.558
Nah.

2116
01:44:19.029 --> 01:44:20.453
Imma do my own thing.

2117
01:44:21.193 --> 01:44:22.348
Sorry, man.

2118
01:44:22.373 --> 01:44:23.273
I'm going home.

2119
01:44:40.086 --> 01:44:40.993
Goodbye, Gwen.

2120
01:44:44.897 --> 01:44:45.703
Miles!

2121
01:44:50.176 --> 01:44:52.276
I taught him how to do that, so...

2122
01:44:52.301 --> 01:44:54.781
I gotta be a pretty good mentor, to pull that off!

2123
01:45:05.674 --> 01:45:06.174
Nope.

2124
01:45:06.831 --> 01:45:07.514
No.

2125
01:45:08.002 --> 01:45:08.716
Uh-uh.

2126
01:45:08.949 --> 01:45:10.129
That's kinda cute.

2127
01:45:10.154 --> 01:45:11.110
Oh, no. No...

2128
01:45:12.661 --> 01:45:13.361
Ah!

2129
01:45:14.438 --> 01:45:14.938
Huh?

2130
01:45:22.164 --> 01:45:22.897
Hmm...

2131
01:45:34.481 --> 01:45:34.941
Wha...?

2132
01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:38.182
Initializing Go Home Machine.

2133
01:45:51.394 --> 01:45:53.347
Retinal signature identified.

2134
01:46:03.747 --> 01:46:04.616
Come on...!

2135
01:46:04.641 --> 01:46:06.040
No!

2136
01:46:06.065 --> 01:46:08.238
No...no...no!

2137
01:46:14.249 --> 01:46:15.689
What's happening?

2138
01:46:15.714 --> 01:46:17.474
The machine activated on its own!

2139
01:46:17.499 --> 01:46:18.344
How's that possible?

2140
01:46:18.369 --> 01:46:19.051
It isn't!

2141
01:46:26.968 --> 01:46:27.581
How 'bout this?

2142
01:46:27.606 --> 01:46:28.933
- No, no, no, no! Ugh!
- Hey, how 'bout now?

2143
01:46:28.958 --> 01:46:30.067
You're getting in the way!

2144
01:46:47.805 --> 01:46:48.772
Stop him!

2145
01:46:48.797 --> 01:46:49.445
Now!

2146
01:46:49.685 --> 01:46:51.485
Man, what does it look like I'm trying to do?!

2147
01:47:00.544 --> 01:47:01.791
Do something!

2148
01:47:02.143 --> 01:47:02.863
-Now!

2149
01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:06.547
Miguel!

2150
01:47:06.847 --> 01:47:07.694
Stop!

2151
01:47:35.604 --> 01:47:36.451
No!

2152
01:47:50.292 --> 01:47:53.185
O--okay, enough! It's not the console's fault.

2153
01:47:53.210 --> 01:47:55.105
All he had to do was listen!

2154
01:47:56.138 --> 01:47:57.125
Why didn't he listen?

2155
01:47:57.150 --> 01:47:58.601
Maybe, you weren't hard enough on him!

2156
01:47:58.626 --> 01:47:59.593
Gwen, don't do it.

2157
01:47:59.618 --> 01:48:00.613
You let him go.

2158
01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:02.033
-Me?
-You didn't catch him,

2159
01:48:02.058 --> 01:48:04.806
- Gwen.
- Okay, let's all just take a breath...
- Peter!

2160
01:48:04.831 --> 01:48:05.664
You wanna back me up?!

2161
01:48:05.689 --> 01:48:07.008
Well, okay. Miguel?

2162
01:48:07.033 --> 01:48:08.928
As a father of a daughter, and

2163
01:48:08.953 --> 01:48:10.160
the son of a mother...

2164
01:48:10.185 --> 01:48:11.360
Yeah, actually, stop talking.

2165
01:48:11.385 --> 01:48:12.493
Okay, duly noted.

2166
01:48:12.518 --> 01:48:13.849
Let me just talk to him.

2167
01:48:15.397 --> 01:48:16.411
We tried that.

2168
01:48:16.436 --> 01:48:17.504
He's my friend.

2169
01:48:17.529 --> 01:48:18.612
Yeah, and that's the problem.

2170
01:48:18.637 --> 01:48:21.434
Do you know for certain what happens if he breaks the canon?

2171
01:48:22.991 --> 01:48:24.305
You wanna find out?

2172
01:48:24.892 --> 01:48:26.672
I told you she was a liability!

2173
01:48:28.018 --> 01:48:28.985
You're wrong.

2174
01:48:29.725 --> 01:48:30.652
Jess?

2175
01:48:30.677 --> 01:48:31.978
Tell him he's wrong.

2176
01:48:33.404 --> 01:48:34.616
He's...not.

2177
01:48:34.641 --> 01:48:36.435
Are you serious right now?

2178
01:48:36.460 --> 01:48:37.674
I told you.

2179
01:48:37.699 --> 01:48:39.333
You let him get away,

2180
01:48:39.358 --> 01:48:40.473
I can't help you.

2181
01:48:41.015 --> 01:48:42.631
I'm not coming.

2182
01:48:42.656 --> 01:48:43.429
You're right.

2183
01:48:44.104 --> 01:48:44.684
What?

2184
01:48:46.364 --> 01:48:47.357
What the hell?!

2185
01:48:57.529 --> 01:48:58.849
Go home, Gwen.

2186
01:49:04.474 --> 01:49:06.740
We are supposed to be the good guys.

2187
01:49:23.062 --> 01:49:24.042
We are.

2188
01:49:27.403 --> 01:49:28.317
We are.

2189
01:49:30.226 --> 01:49:31.603
Jess. Ben.

2190
01:49:31.628 --> 01:49:32.537
Come with me.

2191
01:49:32.562 --> 01:49:33.592
Hell yeah!

2192
01:49:33.617 --> 01:49:35.411
Somebody catch Spot.

2193
01:49:35.436 --> 01:49:36.683
Yeah, sorry. I, uhh...

2194
01:49:36.708 --> 01:49:38.306
I gotta get her down for a nap.

2195
01:49:38.331 --> 01:49:39.305
Not you.

2196
01:49:39.330 --> 01:49:41.096
I've had the right amount of you.

2197
01:50:33.799 --> 01:50:35.812
How was work?

2198
01:50:35.837 --> 01:50:37.151
I don't know.

2199
01:50:37.176 --> 01:50:37.813
Peter?

2200
01:50:38.494 --> 01:50:40.694
Did you bring our baby to another fight?

2201
01:50:40.719 --> 01:50:43.114
Did I bring our ba-? No. No--no.

2202
01:50:43.139 --> 01:50:45.811
'Cuz you asked me not to. So, I didn't. I wouldn't.

2203
01:50:45.836 --> 01:50:46.556
Mm-hmm.

2204
01:51:17.818 --> 01:51:19.318
You think I'll be any good at this?

2205
01:51:21.067 --> 01:51:22.373
You're asking that now?

2206
01:51:24.471 --> 01:51:27.111
There's no playbook for raising someone like her.

2207
01:51:27.919 --> 01:51:28.566
-Or...

2208
01:51:29.191 --> 01:51:31.051
being someone like you.

2209
01:51:35.118 --> 01:51:37.680
You just gotta...make the right adjustments at halftime.

2210
01:51:42.904 --> 01:51:45.290
-That's a sports metaphor, by the way.
-I understand.

2211
01:51:45.315 --> 01:51:46.233
Wow, sorry.

2212
01:51:46.258 --> 01:51:48.243
You were just such a nerd in high school, I figured...

2213
01:51:48.268 --> 01:51:50.340
I have watched sports!

2214
01:51:50.365 --> 01:51:53.024
- Ah! Okay, champ.
- Unbelievable.

2215
01:52:21.168 --> 01:52:22.448
Wanna go easy on the penguin?

2216
01:52:23.329 --> 01:52:24.469
Just...

2217
01:52:25.735 --> 01:52:27.035
You won't even look at me?

2218
01:52:29.370 --> 01:52:29.997
What?

2219
01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:31.700
What--what is that?

2220
01:52:32.656 --> 01:52:33.529
I'm looking at you.

2221
01:52:34.049 --> 01:52:34.929
Like you asked.

2222
01:52:37.801 --> 01:52:38.741
You look skinny.

2223
01:52:40.298 --> 01:52:41.285
Where have you been?

2224
01:52:41.641 --> 01:52:42.848
Just been, uhh...

2225
01:52:42.873 --> 01:52:44.768
out murdering all my friends.

2226
01:52:44.793 --> 01:52:47.648
Oh. Oh, that's funny, uhh, okay. Yeah.

2227
01:52:47.673 --> 01:52:48.473
Okay.

2228
01:52:54.301 --> 01:52:55.041
Where are you going?

2229
01:52:55.066 --> 01:52:55.941
I don't know.

2230
01:53:00.659 --> 01:53:02.432
You're a good cop, Dad.

2231
01:53:03.521 --> 01:53:06.117
You know you put on that badge because you know if you don't,

2232
01:53:06.142 --> 01:53:08.082
someone who shouldn't will.

2233
01:53:09.278 --> 01:53:09.904
But...

2234
01:53:10.417 --> 01:53:12.357
you have to understand.

2235
01:53:12.382 --> 01:53:14.803
This mask is my badge.

2236
01:53:15.873 --> 01:53:18.711
And I'm trying to be good, too.

2237
01:53:19.292 --> 01:53:21.698
I was trying so hard

2238
01:53:21.723 --> 01:53:23.964
to wear this thing the way you would want!

2239
01:53:24.780 --> 01:53:26.153
And I didn't.

2240
01:53:26.803 --> 01:53:27.549
I didn't!

2241
01:53:27.969 --> 01:53:29.175
I can do all these things,

2242
01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:31.787
but I can't help the people I love the most.

2243
01:53:31.812 --> 01:53:34.415
And they can only know half of who I am!

2244
01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:37.899
So I'm...completely on my own!

2245
01:53:37.924 --> 01:53:39.315
And now, I don't...

2246
01:53:39.340 --> 01:53:41.379
I don't even know what the right thing is, anymore.

2247
01:53:41.404 --> 01:53:42.944
I don't know what I'm supposed to do!

2248
01:53:42.969 --> 01:53:44.131
But I know...

2249
01:53:46.139 --> 01:53:48.770
I can't lose one more friend.

2250
01:53:52.201 --> 01:53:53.129
Gwen...

2251
01:53:53.154 --> 01:53:55.921
I always taught you to do it by the book.

2252
01:53:55.946 --> 01:53:57.282
Yeah, and how did that work out?

2253
01:53:57.307 --> 01:53:58.361
I took an oath.

2254
01:53:58.386 --> 01:54:00.258
Then arrest me, Dad!

2255
01:54:01.563 --> 01:54:03.443
- Get it over with.
- I...

2256
01:54:03.468 --> 01:54:04.398
I can't.

2257
01:54:04.832 --> 01:54:05.398
Why not?

2258
01:54:06.371 --> 01:54:07.731
Because I quit.

2259
01:54:09.126 --> 01:54:09.640
When?

2260
01:54:11.241 --> 01:54:13.128
About halfway through your big speech.

2261
01:54:13.935 --> 01:54:14.695
You're...

2262
01:54:15.353 --> 01:54:17.493
Wait a minute. You're not--you're not gonna be captain?

2263
01:54:18.979 --> 01:54:20.026
That means...

2264
01:54:21.755 --> 01:54:24.228
My job...being captain...

2265
01:54:24.766 --> 01:54:25.652
This whole...

2266
01:54:26.426 --> 01:54:28.295
thing doesn't matter anymore.

2267
01:54:32.992 --> 01:54:34.978
You're the best thing I've ever done.

2268
01:54:50.709 --> 01:54:52.002
It was a good speech, huh?

2269
01:54:52.027 --> 01:54:53.399
No wonder you got an A in English.

2270
01:54:53.424 --> 01:54:55.368
B. I got a B. Plus.

2271
01:54:55.393 --> 01:54:56.469
Missed a few classes.

2272
01:54:58.547 --> 01:55:00.554
I don't know what it is you gotta do,

2273
01:55:02.489 --> 01:55:04.889
But I...I think that this thing is supposed to help.

2274
01:55:07.193 --> 01:55:09.286
The guy who left it was a real piece of work.

2275
01:55:34.225 --> 01:55:35.345
I'll be right back.

2276
01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:38.253
Promise.

2277
01:55:46.666 --> 01:55:47.552
Parenting...

2278
01:55:48.166 --> 01:55:49.152
stuff is...

2279
01:55:50.621 --> 01:55:51.768
a big-ass mystery.

2280
01:55:58.235 --> 01:55:59.195
You're a mistake!

2281
01:55:59.646 --> 01:56:01.232
-If you hadn't been bit,

2282
01:56:01.601 --> 01:56:03.158
Peter Parker would've lived!

2283
01:56:03.705 --> 01:56:05.478
And none of this would've happened!

2284
01:56:05.792 --> 01:56:06.827
Miles...

2285
01:56:06.852 --> 01:56:09.206
-the hardest thing about this job is...

2286
01:56:09.574 --> 01:56:11.008
-you can't always save everybody.

2287
01:56:11.033 --> 01:56:12.456
I'll make you pay...

2288
01:56:12.943 --> 01:56:14.638
for everything you took away from me.

2289
01:56:14.663 --> 01:56:16.918
...the choice between saving one person,

2290
01:56:16.943 --> 01:56:19.748
- and an entire world. Every world.
- I can do both!

2291
01:56:19.773 --> 01:56:21.015
Spiderman always...

2292
01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:22.165
Not always.

2293
01:56:22.190 --> 01:56:24.117
Whatever you wanna do out there,

2294
01:56:24.142 --> 01:56:25.612
don't get lost.

2295
01:56:25.637 --> 01:56:27.844
- Things are gonna happen.
- I...I didn't know...

2296
01:56:27.869 --> 01:56:30.158
-...how to tell you.
- You're not supposed to be Spiderman!

2297
01:56:33.188 --> 01:56:34.188
Keep going.

2298
01:56:39.069 --> 01:56:39.869
Ah!

2299
01:56:51.883 --> 01:56:53.090
Did you check your locations?

2300
01:56:53.115 --> 01:56:53.977
Yes, Dad.

2301
01:56:54.002 --> 01:56:54.620
No sign of him.

2302
01:56:54.645 --> 01:56:56.384
Lyla, would you just send everyone out?

2303
01:56:56.409 --> 01:56:58.460
Anywhere. Anywhere he might be!

2304
01:56:58.485 --> 01:56:59.925
Congrats, Captain.

2305
01:56:59.950 --> 01:57:02.167
Captain? You can't call me that 'till I'm sworn in.

2306
01:57:02.192 --> 01:57:03.020
You know that.

2307
01:57:03.045 --> 01:57:03.907
We're all proud of you!

2308
01:57:32.302 --> 01:57:34.906
Perfect pose.

2309
01:57:34.931 --> 01:57:36.073
Wha...?

2310
01:57:36.098 --> 01:57:37.632
Possible disturbance in the alley.

2311
01:57:37.657 --> 01:57:39.006
Better go check it out.

2312
01:57:39.706 --> 01:57:41.271
Now, I'm here in the alley.

2313
01:57:41.885 --> 01:57:43.725
There's something unusual happening.

2314
01:57:43.750 --> 01:57:45.873
Looking at the walls--those are normal.

2315
01:57:45.898 --> 01:57:47.299
But there's something in front of me-

2316
01:57:47.324 --> 01:57:47.700
Ah!

2317
01:57:47.725 --> 01:57:49.861
Ohhhh no!

2318
01:58:08.276 --> 01:58:08.856
[sighs]

2319
01:58:09.649 --> 01:58:10.329
I made it.

2320
01:58:11.192 --> 01:58:12.058
I'm home.

2321
01:58:17.570 --> 01:58:18.397
Miles?

2322
01:58:24.069 --> 01:58:25.289
Is now a bad time...?

2323
01:58:25.678 --> 01:58:27.665
- Am I--am I too late?
- What'd you do to your hair?

2324
01:58:27.690 --> 01:58:29.435
Are you guys okay? Tell me you're okay!

2325
01:58:30.563 --> 01:58:31.550
I'm okay...!

2326
01:58:32.259 --> 01:58:33.079
You were right.

2327
01:58:34.102 --> 01:58:35.355
You were right about everything.

2328
01:58:35.380 --> 01:58:36.601
Of course I'm right. I'm always right.

2329
01:58:37.385 --> 01:58:38.358
What am I right about?

2330
01:58:38.383 --> 01:58:41.192
I saw...all these amazing places!

2331
01:58:41.217 --> 01:58:43.083
And met all these amazing people!

2332
01:58:43.572 --> 01:58:44.172
But...

2333
01:58:44.197 --> 01:58:45.379
¿Que te pasa, mijo?

2334
01:58:47.528 --> 01:58:48.655
But they didn't want me.

2335
01:58:49.799 --> 01:58:51.993
I...I kept thinking about what you said.

2336
01:58:53.765 --> 01:58:54.832
I let 'em have it, Mom.

2337
01:58:56.644 --> 01:58:57.698
I beat 'em all.

2338
01:59:01.559 --> 01:59:03.593
I know how strong I am, now.

2339
01:59:05.017 --> 01:59:06.810
I'm strong because of you!

2340
01:59:07.968 --> 01:59:08.794
-And Dad!

2341
01:59:08.819 --> 01:59:09.992
¿Que to?

2342
01:59:10.458 --> 01:59:11.324
And us!

2343
01:59:14.188 --> 01:59:14.755
Mom...

2344
01:59:16.622 --> 01:59:18.089
there's something coming for us.

2345
01:59:19.790 --> 01:59:20.530
Something...

2346
01:59:21.360 --> 01:59:22.451
something terrible.

2347
01:59:22.476 --> 01:59:25.178
Miles, you're talking crazy. What's going on?

2348
01:59:25.203 --> 01:59:26.063
-His name is Spot.

2349
01:59:27.143 --> 01:59:28.423
He's my nemesis.

2350
01:59:29.959 --> 01:59:31.226
And I'm gonna stop him.

2351
01:59:36.954 --> 01:59:38.843
I know you know I've been lying to you.

2352
01:59:40.361 --> 01:59:42.628
It's because I thought if you knew...

2353
01:59:43.887 --> 01:59:45.520
you wouldn't love me the same.

2354
01:59:48.190 --> 01:59:49.883
And then I went out there, and...

2355
01:59:51.370 --> 01:59:52.236
And now...

2356
01:59:54.438 --> 01:59:55.878
I'm not afraid of anything.

2357
01:59:58.905 --> 02:00:00.038
What do you wanna tell me?

2358
02:00:00.560 --> 02:00:02.440
You gotta promise nothing's gonna change.

2359
02:00:02.465 --> 02:00:03.881
Papa, I will always love you.

2360
02:00:03.906 --> 02:00:04.696
You gotta promise.

2361
02:00:04.721 --> 02:00:05.738
Always.

2362
02:00:06.217 --> 02:00:07.597
I don't care what you say.

2363
02:00:08.727 --> 02:00:09.721
¿Tú me entiendes?

2364
02:00:16.895 --> 02:00:17.529
Mom...

2365
02:00:19.873 --> 02:00:20.440
I'm...

2366
02:00:22.640 --> 02:00:23.860
I'm Spiderman.

2367
02:00:35.152 --> 02:00:36.245
Who's Spiderman?

2368
02:00:38.827 --> 02:00:40.140
...The superhero?

2369
02:00:40.754 --> 02:00:42.090
He got bit by a spider?

2370
02:00:43.444 --> 02:00:45.264
Gave him spider powers?

2371
02:00:47.965 --> 02:00:48.811
He's me?

2372
02:00:53.881 --> 02:00:56.748
Is this where...like, you dress up like your favorite character?

2373
02:00:56.773 --> 02:00:58.184
Or, like, what's it called?

2374
02:00:58.209 --> 02:00:59.191
Like Comics Con!

2375
02:00:59.216 --> 02:01:00.832
I don't know what that is.

2376
02:01:00.857 --> 02:01:03.410
You really had me going there, Spiderman.

2377
02:01:03.435 --> 02:01:04.690
Imagínate.

2378
02:01:12.613 --> 02:01:13.726
Why don't you have 8 arms?

2379
02:01:13.751 --> 02:01:14.139
Um...

2380
02:01:14.164 --> 02:01:15.973
Do you push silk out of your culito?

2381
02:01:15.998 --> 02:01:17.329
I had a nightmare about that once. But no!

2382
02:01:17.354 --> 02:01:18.829
Are you sure you woke up?

2383
02:01:37.621 --> 02:01:39.379
Mom! Stop playing around!

2384
02:01:39.404 --> 02:01:40.598
This is serious!

2385
02:01:40.623 --> 02:01:42.370
Dad worked with Spiderman.

2386
02:01:42.395 --> 02:01:45.360
I mean, he didn't realize Spiderman was me at the time, but...

2387
02:01:45.385 --> 02:01:48.443
- I wish Dad was here to explain this.
- Miles, please.

2388
02:01:52.700 --> 02:01:53.893
I got you to take care of,

2389
02:01:53.918 --> 02:01:55.138
I got me to take care of.

2390
02:01:55.723 --> 02:01:57.423
-So help me out.
-Mom, hold on! Hold on!

2391
02:01:57.448 --> 02:01:58.434
I need to talk-

2392
02:02:16.723 --> 02:02:17.363
42.

2393
02:02:24.135 --> 02:02:26.168
Dimensional signature identified.

2394
02:02:45.566 --> 02:02:46.752
Uncle Aaron?

2395
02:02:48.853 --> 02:02:49.353
Hey.

2396
02:03:01.036 --> 02:03:01.750
You okay?

2397
02:03:06.620 --> 02:03:07.560
Whoa!

2398
02:03:08.543 --> 02:03:10.076
I missed you so much.

2399
02:03:10.101 --> 02:03:11.846
Okay.

2400
02:03:11.871 --> 02:03:13.422
Alright, then. Alright.

2401
02:03:13.447 --> 02:03:14.871
Whoa. You took your braids out?

2402
02:03:14.896 --> 02:03:15.834
Uhh...

2403
02:03:15.859 --> 02:03:17.010
- On purpose?
- Yeah.

2404
02:03:17.035 --> 02:03:19.317
Yeah, I'm still...

2405
02:03:19.342 --> 02:03:20.833
...getting used to it?

2406
02:03:21.742 --> 02:03:24.122
They gave me more hours at the hospital, so next month,

2407
02:03:24.147 --> 02:03:25.751
-I swear, I'll pay you back...
-Stop it, stop it.

2408
02:03:25.776 --> 02:03:26.869
We're family.

2409
02:03:27.742 --> 02:03:28.549
Thanks.

2410
02:03:30.298 --> 02:03:31.391
Hey, honey. How are you doing?

2411
02:03:31.416 --> 02:03:33.112
Hey. How'd it go with Miles?

2412
02:03:33.137 --> 02:03:33.929
Well...

2413
02:03:33.954 --> 02:03:35.878
you know how you grounded him?

2414
02:03:35.903 --> 02:03:36.781
Mm-hmm...

2415
02:03:36.806 --> 02:03:37.935
I ungrounded him.

2416
02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:39.359
You...you what?

2417
02:03:39.384 --> 02:03:40.984
A little bit.

2418
02:03:41.009 --> 02:03:42.322
How much trouble could he get in tonight?

2419
02:03:42.347 --> 02:03:43.369
A lot of trouble!

2420
02:03:43.610 --> 02:03:44.376
I don't wanna think about it.

2421
02:03:46.039 --> 02:03:48.758
Oh, Miles. I have to work an overnight tonight.

2422
02:03:48.783 --> 02:03:49.820
Here's a grocery list.

2423
02:03:49.845 --> 02:03:51.531
I'll make sure he gets this done.

2424
02:03:53.094 --> 02:03:54.314
Alright. We gotta roll.

2425
02:03:59.375 --> 02:04:01.989
Security switches out at 6. That's the window, right?

2426
02:04:02.566 --> 02:04:03.821
...Right. Yep.

2427
02:04:04.919 --> 02:04:07.132
I'm...I'm following you in...

2428
02:04:07.157 --> 02:04:09.051
what you are...saying.

2429
02:04:13.080 --> 02:04:13.748
You alright?

2430
02:04:15.186 --> 02:04:16.640
[weakly] I have a cold.

2431
02:04:18.133 --> 02:04:19.020
C'mon, man.

2432
02:04:20.217 --> 02:04:21.429
Make sure you got the plan.

2433
02:04:22.036 --> 02:04:23.485
Yeah, but...but...

2434
02:04:23.510 --> 02:04:25.615
maybe we should go over it one more time,

2435
02:04:25.640 --> 02:04:27.774
just to make sure there's no...

2436
02:04:28.506 --> 02:04:29.359
problems.

2437
02:04:36.939 --> 02:04:39.052
[whispering] There's no Spiderman here.

2438
02:04:47.484 --> 02:04:48.544
-Oh, no.

2439
02:04:49.018 --> 02:04:49.931
-Dad...

2440
02:05:09.772 --> 02:05:13.170
I'm sorry, baby, but you did unilaterally unground him.

2441
02:05:13.195 --> 02:05:13.960
-[Rio] Jeff...

2442
02:05:13.985 --> 02:05:17.590
I just--I just worry about him getting
mixed up with the wrong people, okay?

2443
02:05:17.615 --> 02:05:19.592
This is probably that girl.

2444
02:05:19.617 --> 02:05:21.745
What is he even thinking, being with her?

2445
02:05:21.770 --> 02:05:23.358
I have some ideas.

2446
02:05:23.383 --> 02:05:24.987
Baby...you're really not helping.

2447
02:05:25.012 --> 02:05:27.281
You saw the way he lit up around her!

2448
02:05:28.775 --> 02:05:30.315
-...I just hope she doesn't get him hurt.

2449
02:05:33.656 --> 02:05:35.702
I mean, am I responsible for this?

2450
02:05:35.727 --> 02:05:36.796
No, no!

2451
02:05:36.821 --> 02:05:37.644
Maybe it's all my fault!

2452
02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:40.146
Come on, papa, you're a great dad.

2453
02:05:40.171 --> 02:05:40.657
This is all...

2454
02:05:40.682 --> 02:05:43.298
It's just...it's hard. It's like...

2455
02:05:43.323 --> 02:05:47.018
we got a whole new kid who just wants to grow up so fast.

2456
02:05:48.978 --> 02:05:51.025
And maybe, we gotta grow up, too.

2457
02:05:52.697 --> 02:05:53.571
A little bit.

2458
02:05:54.182 --> 02:05:56.776
Maybe we just gotta let him spread his wings, man.

2459
02:05:57.429 --> 02:05:58.123
"Man"?

2460
02:05:58.938 --> 02:06:00.212
It's not your fault.

2461
02:06:02.929 --> 02:06:03.962
It's mine.

2462
02:06:04.560 --> 02:06:07.029
Oh, come on. What the heck are you doing here?

2463
02:06:07.054 --> 02:06:09.607
Oh, uhh, his window was open, so I came in.

2464
02:06:09.632 --> 02:06:12.236
Because that's...normal...to do.

2465
02:06:12.261 --> 02:06:13.582
I wanna talk to your parents.

2466
02:06:13.607 --> 02:06:15.961
Right. My, uhh...my dad's kinda hard to get on the horn.

2467
02:06:15.986 --> 02:06:17.323
Oh, really? What does he do?

2468
02:06:17.348 --> 02:06:18.150
Deal drugs?

2469
02:06:18.890 --> 02:06:19.877
He's a cop.

2470
02:06:22.158 --> 02:06:23.478
Statement withdrawn.

2471
02:06:24.191 --> 02:06:25.311
Yep, well, I'm gonna call the station.

2472
02:06:25.336 --> 02:06:27.471
I don't think he's there. Or...

2473
02:06:27.496 --> 02:06:28.664
anywhere around here.

2474
02:06:28.689 --> 02:06:30.302
Well, that's his jacket, emo!

2475
02:06:30.327 --> 02:06:31.035
Where's Miles?

2476
02:06:31.060 --> 02:06:31.559
I don't know.

2477
02:06:31.584 --> 02:06:32.890
You don't know?

2478
02:06:32.915 --> 02:06:34.040
What do you mean, you don't know?!

2479
02:06:34.065 --> 02:06:35.647
Yeah. Umm...I'll leave.

2480
02:06:35.672 --> 02:06:37.482
Where do you think you're going, young lady?

2481
02:06:38.082 --> 02:06:39.389
I'm going to find him.

2482
02:06:40.809 --> 02:06:42.563
I don't know where, exactly...

2483
02:06:44.219 --> 02:06:45.573
But I know where to start.

2484
02:06:47.525 --> 02:06:49.192
One thing I learned from Miles...

2485
02:06:51.026 --> 02:06:52.426
it's all possible.

2486
02:06:55.146 --> 02:06:58.299
He loves you more than you could ever imagine.

2487
02:07:02.462 --> 02:07:03.302
I've seen it.

2488
02:07:08.846 --> 02:07:10.253
If you do find him...

2489
02:07:12.559 --> 02:07:14.345
tell him 5 months.

2490
02:07:16.752 --> 02:07:18.485
And tell him we love him.

2491
02:07:20.326 --> 02:07:21.120
You got it.

2492
02:07:55.249 --> 02:07:56.176
Uncle Aaron...

2493
02:08:03.217 --> 02:08:04.017
Wait, wait.

2494
02:08:04.451 --> 02:08:05.651
I was...listen.

2495
02:08:06.009 --> 02:08:06.816
Okay, um...

2496
02:08:11.201 --> 02:08:12.361
You don't understand.

2497
02:08:12.386 --> 02:08:13.486
I'm not from here.

2498
02:08:14.631 --> 02:08:16.526
I'm from an entirely different dimension.

2499
02:08:17.150 --> 02:08:18.876
Wait, wait, wait. Please, please. Please!

2500
02:08:18.901 --> 02:08:19.490
Please!

2501
02:08:20.181 --> 02:08:21.567
I got sent here by mistake!

2502
02:08:21.592 --> 02:08:24.217
Uncle Aaron, wait, wait, wait, wait! Uncle Aaron!

2503
02:08:39.037 --> 02:08:39.670
Please.

2504
02:08:40.231 --> 02:08:41.277
Uncle Aaron?

2505
02:08:42.396 --> 02:08:43.963
Just...hear me out.

2506
02:08:47.658 --> 02:08:50.184
I was bit by a spider that gave me powers.

2507
02:08:51.087 --> 02:08:52.740
It wasn't supposed to bite me,

2508
02:08:52.765 --> 02:08:54.730
it was supposed to bite someone else.

2509
02:08:54.755 --> 02:08:55.715
Someone from here.

2510
02:08:56.707 --> 02:08:57.627
I don't belong here.

2511
02:08:58.099 --> 02:08:59.025
I need to go home.

2512
02:08:59.544 --> 02:09:00.030
Okay?

2513
02:09:02.662 --> 02:09:05.096
I have an Uncle Aaron, too. I-I had one.

2514
02:09:05.664 --> 02:09:08.670
He was a bad guy...called the Prowler.

2515
02:09:08.695 --> 02:09:11.366
He...he looked out for me.

2516
02:09:11.391 --> 02:09:13.635
He did a lot of bad things, but...

2517
02:09:14.489 --> 02:09:16.081
I knew he wanted to be good.

2518
02:09:16.635 --> 02:09:18.290
He just...didn't know he had a choice,

2519
02:09:18.314 --> 02:09:19.355
but you do!

2520
02:09:20.367 --> 02:09:21.834
You can be a good guy!

2521
02:09:23.652 --> 02:09:24.687
A good guy?

2522
02:09:25.243 --> 02:09:27.230
Please, just trust me.

2523
02:09:27.255 --> 02:09:28.752
I know you don't wanna be the Prowler.

2524
02:09:41.574 --> 02:09:42.427
I'm not.

2525
02:10:21.067 --> 02:10:22.394
Your dad is still alive?

2526
02:10:23.348 --> 02:10:24.348
What?

2527
02:10:25.152 --> 02:10:26.125
Your father.

2528
02:10:27.063 --> 02:10:28.376
You said he's still alive.

2529
02:10:29.861 --> 02:10:30.528
Yeah.

2530
02:10:33.545 --> 02:10:34.192
Huh.

2531
02:10:35.973 --> 02:10:36.727
Who are you?

2532
02:10:46.278 --> 02:10:47.638
I'm Miles Morales.

2533
02:10:50.165 --> 02:10:51.212
But you...

2534
02:10:51.864 --> 02:10:53.504
you can call me the Prowler.

2535
02:10:55.797 --> 02:10:57.084
If I don't get home...

2536
02:10:58.737 --> 02:11:00.534
our dad...is going to die.

2537
02:11:00.559 --> 02:11:01.837
Your dad.

2538
02:11:04.436 --> 02:11:05.062
Please.

2539
02:11:07.248 --> 02:11:08.621
You have to let me go.

2540
02:11:14.821 --> 02:11:15.914
Why would I do that?

2541
02:12:15.829 --> 02:12:16.902
Don't tell Mom.

2542
02:12:23.993 --> 02:12:25.893
I never found the right band to join.

2543
02:12:28.100 --> 02:12:29.887
So, I started my own.

2544
02:12:33.884 --> 02:12:35.057
With a few old friends.

2545
02:12:57.553 --> 02:12:58.459
Want in?
