05:30.556 --> 05:32.164

05:32.391 --> 05:34.391

a bit lighter down there,

05:38.080 --> 05:40.005
-Miriam: That would only be...
-Whoa.

05:40.156 --> 05:42.399
That would only be the bottom
of that corner.

05:42.417 --> 05:44.584
-Helen: Yes.
-Meaning
it's probably sloping down.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.087
-Helen: Yeah.
-I feel like

05:47.181 --> 05:50.073
-It continues on,

-It could go both ways.

05:50.092 --> 05:52.517
-Even--
maybe even that way, too.
-Yeah. Yeah.

05:52.669 --> 05:55.762
So, these rocks in here, they're
really tightly packed in.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.764
So I'm wondering if...

05:57.858 --> 06:00.192
(clicks tongue) ...Maybe, like,
it is the edge of a wall.

06:01.362 --> 06:03.436
-But we have to keep going
to find out.
-Jack: Yeah.

<i> Rick:</i>
<i> If you apply logic,</i>

06:13.932 --> 06:17.934
<i> But it's early</i>
<i> in the discovery phase.</i>

06:17.953 --> 06:19.436

-Hey, craig.
-Have any luck?

Oh, lots of bits of...
Little bits of charcoal.

06:26.870 --> 06:29.203
Uh, but helen found
something really interesting.

06:29.297 --> 06:31.223
Here, come over here
and take a look.

06:32.393 --> 06:33.374
Helen:
The stones?

06:33.394 --> 06:34.951
Yeah.

06:35.044 --> 06:37.545
So, craig,
when we're taking those out,

06:37.564 --> 06:39.122
They're fairly
loosely consolidated

06:39.141 --> 06:40.214
-And voids in between them.
-Mm-hmm.

06:40.234 --> 06:42.475
These are packed

06:42.569 --> 06:44.628
Really tightly in there.

06:44.721 --> 06:47.480
Maybe that actually is
inner wall.

06:47.633 --> 06:49.466
We reach a stone layer,

06:49.559 --> 06:52.469
And the stones
seem irregularly placed.

06:52.487 --> 06:54.413
They seem, you know, filled in,

06:54.640 --> 06:57.082
Like they're not part
of a feature. But...

06:57.309 --> 06:59.659
<i> Some of the stones</i>
<i> on the exterior wall</i>

06:59.811 --> 07:01.144
<i> Seem to be placed.</i>

07:01.163 --> 07:02.754
<i>So that's leading us to believe</i>

07:02.981 --> 07:04.589
<i> That these are actually part</i>
<i> of a feature</i>

07:04.816 --> 07:07.926
And the loose stones
were sort of just filled in.

07:08.153 --> 07:10.320
And, miriam, you tell him
about your soils, too.

07:10.413 --> 07:12.656
Yeah, so right in this corner...

07:12.749 --> 07:14.266
-Craig: Mm-hmm.
-...And a bit in this corner,

07:14.417 --> 07:15.825
I think it's sloping down,

07:15.919 --> 07:18.011
Because it's way deeper
in this corner

07:18.105 --> 07:20.922
And-and there's... You know,
there's no end in sight.

07:21.016 --> 07:23.608

Interesting. Good.

07:23.835 --> 07:25.110

<i>However, in the following years,</i>

09:21.303 --> 09:23.970
<i> He would inexplicably become</i>
<i> one of nova scotia's</i>

09:24.122 --> 09:26.565
<i> Most wealthy citizens.</i>

09:26.792 --> 09:30.476
<i> The team has previously</i>
<i> investigated the remains</i>

09:30.629 --> 09:34.647
<i> Of a massive stone wharf</i>
<i> off the shore of lot 26.</i>

09:34.800 --> 09:37.817
<i> So is it possible</i>
<i> that this mysterious well</i>

09:37.969 --> 09:40.320
<i> May also be connected</i>
<i> to the riches</i>

09:40.472 --> 09:43.731
<i> That some believe captain</i>
<i> anderson brought to the island</i>

09:43.750 --> 09:46.492
<i> And the great fortune</i>
<i> of samuel ball?</i>

09:46.587 --> 09:51.590
From the moment I saw the well
in the wintertime years ago,

09:51.817 --> 09:52.999
<i> It wasn't frozen.</i>

09:53.151 --> 09:54.500
<i> That was the real "aha."</i>

09:54.595 --> 09:56.761
<i> Why is this well so unique?</i>

09:56.988 --> 10:01.600
Dr. Spooner and I decided
to go ahead and take a sample

10:01.827 --> 10:05.845
That's a few feet away
from the pond there to see

10:05.939 --> 10:07.847
If it would tell us anything.

10:07.999 --> 10:10.609
And, uh, we've gotten
the results back.

10:10.760 --> 10:13.111
I'll turn it over
to dr. Spooner.

10:13.262 --> 10:14.762
Ian:
So, we got samples

10:14.781 --> 10:16.263
O-of the water from the well.

10:16.358 --> 10:22.011
And, uh, it was one of our only

10:22.105 --> 10:25.348
Silver hits outside
of the money pit.

10:25.441 --> 10:27.417
(laughter)

10:33.708 --> 10:35.358
Well done.

10:35.451 --> 10:36.526
<i> Narrator:</i>
<i> In the war room,</i>

10:36.619 --> 10:39.028
<i> Geoscientist dr. Ian spooner</i>

10:39.047 --> 10:41.547
<i> Has just shared a report</i>
<i> with the team</i>

10:41.700 --> 10:43.958
<i>That water samples taken</i>
<i>from a mysterious well on lot 26</i>

10:43.977 --> 10:47.553
<i> Revealed trace evidence</i>
<i> of possible treasure.</i>

10:48.723 --> 10:50.707
Ian:
The thing that, uh,
I want to just bring up...

10:50.800 --> 10:52.892
But just some background here.

10:53.044 --> 10:55.636
So, this is the location

10:55.730 --> 10:58.381
With the pond in front.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.141
Lot 26 pond.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.811
And the lot 26 well is
right about where that arrow is.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.556
The lot 26 well,
it is very crudely made.

11:06.649 --> 11:11.077
If craig had not shown it to me,

11:11.171 --> 11:13.487
I wouldn't have thought
it was a well. I don't know--

11:13.507 --> 11:15.581
I would have thought
it was just a... Hole.

11:15.734 --> 11:18.418
Water's right to the very top.

11:18.512 --> 11:19.844
And the construction,

11:20.071 --> 11:22.180
-It's rough.
-Rick: The only reason

11:22.407 --> 11:25.091
Why I did come upon it
was because

11:25.243 --> 11:26.926
It was the middle of winter.
There's snow on the ground.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.187
I saw it, you know, and I
thought, "well, that's strange.

11:29.414 --> 11:31.606
Why is--
why isn't that iced over?"

11:32.918 --> 11:35.694
It has, perhaps,
easily escaped observation

11:35.845 --> 11:37.344
For a long, long time.

11:37.364 --> 11:40.256
That's why we need
to core and date it.

11:40.275 --> 11:41.607
Absolutely.

11:42.928 --> 11:46.262
<i> Rick:</i>
<i> Is it possible</i>
<i> that this well is in an area</i>

11:46.281 --> 11:48.039
<i> That has real treasure?</i>

11:48.266 --> 11:50.283
We have
dr. Spooner's water sample,

11:50.435 --> 11:53.770
Which showed
an elevated level of silver.

11:53.788 --> 11:57.106
<i> Hopefully, you know, some</i>
<i> organic material can be found</i>

11:57.200 --> 11:59.033
<i> That can be carbon-dated.</i>

11:59.127 --> 12:01.444
<i> Once you have those answers,</i>
<i> you can move forward.</i>

12:01.463 --> 12:04.889
Let's get a sample
and have it c-14 tested.

12:05.041 --> 12:07.467
-Right.
-We have to follow up,

12:07.619 --> 12:09.710
'cause that was years ago
I found that well.

12:09.804 --> 12:12.397
And only now, only now,

12:12.624 --> 12:15.959
Are we learning
something really incredible.

12:16.052 --> 12:17.794
<i> Let's keep moving forward.</i>

12:17.812 --> 12:19.571
<i> Ian:</i>
<i> Absolutely.</i>

12:23.969 --> 12:25.744
<i> Narrator:</i>
<i> The following day...</i>

12:27.230 --> 12:28.246
Laird:
Here it is.

12:28.397 --> 12:30.064
<i> ...Dr. Ian spooner</i>

12:30.158 --> 12:31.899
<i> And archaeologist laird niven</i>

12:31.993 --> 12:34.660
<i> Arrive on lot 26</i>

12:34.755 --> 12:37.830
<i> To further investigate</i>
<i> the mysterious well.</i>

12:37.983 --> 12:39.924
You wouldn't know it was a well.

12:41.077 --> 12:42.743
Looks crudely made.

12:42.763 --> 12:44.578
-Uh...
-It does.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.747
I'd want to get as much data
as possible, because...

12:46.767 --> 12:50.176
I-I always wonder what
brought them to dig right here.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.586
-I don't know.
-Some inherent knowledge
they had?

12:52.606 --> 12:55.273
-Ian: So, I'm gonna get
this corer set up.
-Okay.

12:55.424 --> 12:57.776
<i> Narrator:</i>
<i> Although the team</i>
<i> is eager to find out</i>

12:58.003 --> 13:00.594
<i> If the well contains</i>
<i> anything of great value,</i>

13:00.688 --> 13:02.596
<i> Laird has directed dr. Spooner</i>

13:02.690 --> 13:06.100
<i> To first collect a core sample</i>
<i> of organic materials</i>

13:06.194 --> 13:09.454
<i> In the hopes of determining</i>
<i> just when it was constructed.</i>

13:10.682 --> 13:13.291
So, this is a piston corer.
So, just looks--

13:13.518 --> 13:15.368
It basically works
like a syringe.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.796
I don't know if you've ever had
a blood sample taken.

13:17.947 --> 13:20.523
-Yeah.
-Yeah. And pull it out.

13:20.542 --> 13:21.858
-That's what this thing does.
-Okay.

13:21.951 --> 13:24.803
This is the piston head.
So, this goes on.

13:24.954 --> 13:28.364
-It's just like the plunger
on the syringe.
-Mm-hmm.

13:28.383 --> 13:29.699
Ian:
Just like that.

13:29.792 --> 13:31.717
What I do is I hit the bottom.

13:31.870 --> 13:33.719
I know how deep it should be.

13:33.872 --> 13:35.462
About that far to the gunk.

13:35.482 --> 13:36.964
Laird:
Yeah.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.483
About three feet.

13:38.634 --> 13:40.819
And so we just go down
like this.

13:46.234 --> 13:48.660
As I push down, I pull up.

13:50.146 --> 13:52.980
-And there's-- I can feel
the bottom right there.
-Mm.

13:53.074 --> 13:55.391
<i> Marty:</i>
<i> The well is-is</i>
<i> really quite amazing.</i>

13:56.336 --> 13:59.729
In the context
of other things found on lot 26,

13:59.747 --> 14:02.173
It maybe, uh,
moves the dial upwards.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.158
<i> And we're trying</i>
<i> to figure out how old it is.</i>

14:04.177 --> 14:06.419
So lift it up.

14:06.571 --> 14:09.681
<i> Marty:</i>
<i> Because lot 26</i>
<i> has always been mysterious.</i>

14:11.426 --> 14:13.667
Let's just see how we did.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.244
Oh, quite good.

14:15.263 --> 14:16.354
Excellent.

14:16.581 --> 14:18.414
There we go.

14:18.507 --> 14:20.433
That's a pretty good core.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.843
-We can see mud
in the bottom of it.
-Yeah.

14:22.863 --> 14:25.530
And then I know it got
at that interface between...

14:26.867 --> 14:28.424
...Abandonment

14:28.517 --> 14:30.034
-And construction.
-Mm-hmm.

14:31.429 --> 14:33.613
-So, yeah,
let's-let's head back up.
-Okay.

14:33.765 --> 14:35.874
<i> Yeah. I can't wait</i>
<i> to see the results.</i>

14:38.603 --> 14:40.694

<i> The following morning...</i>

14:40.714 --> 14:43.122

Just pulling a sample

14:44.700 --> 14:46.959
-From 59 to the bottom.
-Good.

14:55.453 --> 14:58.730

Do it justice,

14:58.957 --> 15:00.473

So can you fill me
in a little bit?

15:17.809 --> 15:19.900
Well, we were actually
contacted by a gentleman

15:19.994 --> 15:21.568
By the name of isaac rafuse.

15:21.588 --> 15:24.255

15:24.482 --> 15:27.425
That these carvings
just may pertain

To what we're doing
on oak island.

15:28.987 --> 15:30.836
Yeah.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.918
You know, they remind me

-Right.
-And I think it's

17:02.022 --> 17:04.580
Is we've got a heck
of a mystery on our hands,

17:04.673 --> 17:06.098

<i>There's information everywhere.</i>

<i> Rick: And we have</i>
<i> to be wise enough to listen</i>

-To show you guys is over here.
-Okay.

17:45.456 --> 17:46.564
Oh, wow.

17:47.959 --> 17:51.218
This one has been here
for a very long time.

17:51.312 --> 17:53.738
The gentleman that showed me

17:53.965 --> 17:56.315
Said that he had asked
his father about it.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.559
And his father said when
he was little, he asked his dad,

17:58.578 --> 18:00.912
And said it had
just been there forever.

18:01.139 --> 18:03.564
We were told this might
be a british broadhead,

18:03.658 --> 18:05.899
But we don't know.

18:05.919 --> 18:07.919
We just know it's been here
for a really long time.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.982
<i> Narrator:</i>
<i> Dating as far back</i>
<i> as the 14th century,</i>

18:13.000 --> 18:15.835
<i> The broadhead symbol</i>
<i> was a stylized</i>

18:15.987 --> 18:17.595
<i>Representation of an arrowhead,</i>

18:17.822 --> 18:21.915
<i> Commonly stamped</i>
<i>on objects to signify ownership</i>

18:22.009 --> 18:25.344
<i> By either the british</i>
<i>government or british nobility.</i>

18:25.496 --> 18:27.496
So that would go back
to, like, the, like,

18:27.590 --> 18:30.015
The founding of liverpool.

18:30.168 --> 18:33.444
<i> Narrator:</i>
<i> Because nova scotia was</i>
<i> an english territory</i>

18:33.596 --> 18:36.930
<i> At various times between</i>
<i> the 16th and 18th centuries,</i>

18:36.950 --> 18:40.509
<i> Is it possible that</i>
<i> this carving was simply made</i>

18:40.603 --> 18:42.078
<i> During one of those periods?</i>

18:43.197 --> 18:46.182
It doesn't...
See how this comes...

18:46.200 --> 18:48.868
-Like, like that?
-Yeah.

18:49.020 --> 18:50.777
Doesn't the broadhead mark
come like that?

18:50.797 --> 18:54.114
-You know what I mean?
It comes to a point.
-Yeah.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.801
This-this melds into a point,
whereas a broadhead

18:57.028 --> 19:00.212
-Arrow mark comes like that.
-Yeah.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.140
And in many cases,

19:02.367 --> 19:04.533
The broadhead,
the middle leg will be...

19:04.552 --> 19:07.294
-Rick: Is longer.
-...Longer than the two ones
on the side.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.147
-Right.
-Corjan: And the other thing is

19:09.374 --> 19:11.632
The broadheads were put on,
on everything

19:11.651 --> 19:13.985
Basically that the,
that the king, uh, purchased.

19:14.212 --> 19:16.545
So, it could be weapons,
uh, equipment.

19:16.564 --> 19:18.381
They put it on trees
if they wanted to use them

19:18.474 --> 19:19.991
For ships, but never on rock.

19:21.161 --> 19:22.827
I think that's unlikely.

19:25.481 --> 19:26.906
To me this looks like, uh,

19:27.058 --> 19:30.059
What we call
a "goose paw" in, uh, in europe.

19:30.077 --> 19:32.670
And if that's what it is,
that would be something,

19:32.821 --> 19:35.564
Because that is the...

19:35.583 --> 19:38.325
The mark of the masons
for the knights templar

19:38.419 --> 19:40.178
In medieval europe.

19:42.831 --> 19:44.331
<i> Charles:</i>
<i> That is very cool.</i>

19:44.425 --> 19:50.262

19:58.198 --> 20:00.756
<i> Have just been shown</i>

20:00.775 --> 20:01.924
<i> That researcher corjan mol</i>
<i> believes could have been made</i>

20:02.017 --> 20:04.351
<i> By members</i>
<i> of the knights templar.</i>

20:04.370 --> 20:06.762
Many of them worked
on the cathedrals

20:06.781 --> 20:08.188
And the great churches.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.616
So this, to me, is a goose paw.

20:10.768 --> 20:13.452
And you see them in-in churches

20:13.604 --> 20:15.438
All around the mediterranean--

20:15.531 --> 20:18.049
Uh, northern portugal,
Spain, southern France,

20:18.200 --> 20:21.552
Italy, sardinia--
you will often find this mark

20:21.704 --> 20:24.630
On the cornerstone
of confirmed templar churches.

20:25.725 --> 20:29.134
So it could be from
a medieval cathedral builder.

20:29.287 --> 20:31.545
-That's pretty cool.
-Mm-hmm.

20:50.808 --> 20:52.399
Nick: And what do you think
that would indicate?

20:52.418 --> 20:55.494
Why would they carve it there?

20:55.646 --> 20:57.313
I'm a templar, I come here,
we have masons,

20:57.331 --> 20:59.072
We need to build stuff.

20:59.166 --> 21:00.816
Imagine, you come here,
you have 30 guys in a boat.

21:00.909 --> 21:03.427
You know,
you arrive here from the ocean.

21:03.654 --> 21:05.337
-Nick: Yep.
-Take a sloop, you know,

21:05.490 --> 21:07.506
Take it up the shore there.

21:07.658 --> 21:09.492
-And then put this...
-It's definitely
a deep enough harbor.

21:09.585 --> 21:11.602
Yeah, and then put
this symbol here to, uh,

21:11.754 --> 21:13.345
-To tell your friends
that you were here.
-Right.

One, this is certainly worth
further investigation.

22:11.572 --> 22:14.481
We have something
that's carved by the human hand

22:14.500 --> 22:17.059

22:18.504 --> 22:21.172

-And two, just the hint

22:21.323 --> 22:22.731
Of what
it might represent, right?

22:22.750 --> 22:25.067
You just said
it could be someone who

22:25.086 --> 22:28.012
Brought his experience
creating cathedrals and...

22:28.163 --> 22:29.496
And templar churches.

22:29.515 --> 22:32.850
-Yeah.
-But I want to make certain.

22:33.001 --> 22:34.760
-Corjan: It needs research.
-It needs research.

22:34.912 --> 22:36.595

more carvings than this one?

Yeah.

22:50.094 --> 22:52.018

-Corjan: Oh, wow!

22:56.434 --> 22:57.950
Isaac:
If you, if you, look on the
underside, there's a very...

22:58.044 --> 23:01.120
-Oh, there, yep, yeah.
-...Distinct cross carved here.

23:01.214 --> 23:03.956
Is that, like, a circle
or something at the base of it?

23:04.050 --> 23:07.718
Isaac: Yeah.
Just below it there's a circle

23:07.870 --> 23:10.279
With a line,
it looks, through it.

23:10.297 --> 23:12.372
-Charles: Okay.
-Down here, you've got a half

23:12.392 --> 23:14.374
A circle with a dot
in the middle.

23:14.394 --> 23:16.042
Corjan:
Oh, yeah.

23:16.062 --> 23:20.231
Isaac:
And then here, you've got this.

23:20.382 --> 23:22.458
Two definite, uh...

23:22.476 --> 23:25.477
Branches on a line here
and then some,

23:25.630 --> 23:28.906
Another, another piece
that could be an "x."

23:30.134 --> 23:32.968
So I would say this
is a globus cruciger.

23:33.061 --> 23:34.987
That's what they call it,
the, the circle

23:35.139 --> 23:36.580
With the cross on top.

23:36.807 --> 23:39.642
Can mean a number
of things: God, jesus.

they belong together.

bedded stuff, you have a fine

27:14.208 --> 27:16.525
Sand in tighter materials.

27:16.543 --> 27:19.452
So that's a classic example
of where material

27:19.472 --> 27:21.713
Has been shot into
an area under pressure.

27:21.866 --> 27:24.124

Helen:
What do you have?

30:44.918 --> 30:47.419
A clay pipe stem.

30:47.571 --> 30:49.346
-In the rocks.
-Oh, wow!

30:51.258 --> 30:53.851
Helen: In the rocks?
We hardly get any of those

30:54.002 --> 30:55.093
-On the island. No.
-I don't think I have found

30:55.187 --> 30:56.912
-A single one.
-No.

30:56.930 --> 30:59.690
Yeah, and gary says
he typically finds lots of them.

30:59.841 --> 31:02.359
It's perfect for dating.
Like, it's in the feature.

31:02.510 --> 31:04.344
-Helen: Yeah.
-And based on the size
of the hole...

31:04.438 --> 31:07.089
-Of the borehole. Yes.
-...We can tell how old it is.

31:07.107 --> 31:09.682
Jack: And how do
you get a date from it, exactly?

31:09.702 --> 31:11.351
Helen:
It's the size of the borehole.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.036
-Jack: In the middle of it?
-Yeah.

31:13.188 --> 31:16.264
So the hole going through
the pipe stem changed over time.

31:16.283 --> 31:19.359
So why-why is it just
a piece of pipe stem?

31:19.378 --> 31:21.194
Helen:
Because they were quite fragile.

31:21.213 --> 31:23.363
And they were
fairly cheap to buy.

31:23.382 --> 31:26.366
So, they used to, like,
import them by the barrel load.

31:26.385 --> 31:28.793
And so, they were
one of the cheaper

31:28.888 --> 31:30.795
Throw-away things of the time.

31:30.890 --> 31:32.556
Kind of like a cigarette butt.

31:32.707 --> 31:35.058
Yep, similar to that.

31:35.285 --> 31:38.136
With a clay pipe,
what is the date range

31:38.288 --> 31:39.897
Of its use in general?

31:41.291 --> 31:44.960
The earliest pipes, I think,
were in the late-ish 1500s.

31:44.978 --> 31:47.553
And you'd get them up
until the late 1800s.

31:47.648 --> 31:49.907
Miriam: Oh, this'll be great
for dating this feature.

31:50.134 --> 31:52.817
This reminds me of
when we were in the southeast

31:52.912 --> 31:55.412
Corner of the swamp,
excavating the stone road

31:55.639 --> 31:58.398
And rick was asking,
"where are all the clay pipes?"

31:58.417 --> 32:01.159
We weren't finding any,
so it's really interesting

32:01.311 --> 32:03.328
That they're here and not there.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.830
I'm kind of wondering
maybe if lot 5 has something

32:05.925 --> 32:08.150
To do with what was
going on in the swamp.

32:08.168 --> 32:10.260
Oh, yeah.

-Once we get back to the lab.
-We can-- we can get
a date range for it

of the borehole

33:59.538 --> 34:00.945
-That goes through the pipe.
-Rick: Oh, really?
-Mm-hmm.

34:01.040 --> 34:03.689
It was actually found
within the rocks of the feature.

34:03.709 --> 34:08.270
So we think it was deposited
as this was constructed.

34:09.439 --> 34:11.197
Helen:
And then,
at some later point in time,

34:11.216 --> 34:13.032
It was filled
with rocks in the middle.

34:13.126 --> 34:15.701
The rocks in the middle
were very loose and jumbly,

34:15.796 --> 34:17.203
With gaps between them.

34:17.222 --> 34:18.797
-Mm-hmm.
-The ones here on the side

34:18.891 --> 34:20.965

34:22.803 --> 34:24.377
-But they don't move. So...
-Yeah.
-Rick: Mm.

34:24.396 --> 34:26.379
I've played with stone enough
to know that

34:26.398 --> 34:28.548
-That piece there...
-Helen: Yeah.

34:28.642 --> 34:30.475
-...That's purposeful. Yeah.
-It's to wedge it. Yeah.

34:30.569 --> 34:32.794
Rick:
Implying some sort
of permanence

34:32.813 --> 34:34.905
-To the structure.
-Yeah.

34:35.132 --> 34:36.314
The nice thing about this
is this is

34:36.466 --> 34:38.149
The oldest european deposit

34:38.302 --> 34:39.818
We have found on the island.

34:39.912 --> 34:42.971
Which is pre-discovery
of the m-money pit.

<i> And we just need</i>
<i> to continue to look.</i>

35:03.327 --> 35:05.251
You know,
this is probably not isolated,

35:05.345 --> 35:07.587
-Based upon all the finds
we've had.
-Miriam and rick: Mm-hmm.

35:07.606 --> 35:08.847
Uh, there's something
that happened here.

35:08.999 --> 35:10.423
-Rick: Yeah.
-Jack: I'd say

35:10.442 --> 35:12.000
-This is just a start.
-Gary: Yeah.

35:12.093 --> 35:14.611
And it's luck that
we would pick this one spot.

35:14.838 --> 35:16.855
So it's-it's great that you
were here to be able to find it

35:17.007 --> 35:19.674
And then for us to come in
and sort of...

35:19.693 --> 35:21.343
-Bring it all together.
-Rick: Mm-hmm.

there is.

Dr. Spooner recently went out

36:08.558 --> 36:10.316
I'll turn it over to dr. Spooner

36:10.410 --> 36:13.336
And let him describe the core
and then the results.

36:13.488 --> 36:15.338
Ian:
Thank you. Yeah.

36:15.490 --> 36:18.508
What we got out of it, I think,
was completely unexpected,

36:18.660 --> 36:20.326
Right from the get-go.

36:20.345 --> 36:21.903
Um, but just
some background here.

36:21.996 --> 36:25.331
The circle that we see there
in dashes,

36:25.350 --> 36:27.851
That's really where the well is,
so...

36:28.002 --> 36:29.594
Next slide there, steve.

36:29.688 --> 36:30.670
(mouse clicks)

36:30.764 --> 36:32.672
And so here's the core.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.840
Now, you can see
that there's twigs in it,

36:34.860 --> 36:37.268
There's little stones
that might have fallen in it.

36:37.421 --> 36:40.846
So, I dated that little brown
piece of wood at the bottom,

36:40.866 --> 36:43.107
Which I will say--
this is very important--

36:43.260 --> 36:44.442
Was probably not in the mud

36:44.594 --> 36:46.261
But was probably in the dirt

36:46.354 --> 36:48.038
At the bottom of the well.

36:48.265 --> 36:50.707
So it's more likely associated
with construction.

36:50.858 --> 36:53.768
And how I know that is,
it-it sort of went...

36:53.787 --> 36:55.954
-Below the mud in the core.
-Oh, okay.

36:56.106 --> 36:57.455

36:57.607 --> 36:59.198

So, there we go.

37:49.659 --> 37:51.175
That's-that's
where we sat with this core.

37:51.270 --> 37:53.270
To me, it was just
a whole bunch of surprises.

37:54.439 --> 37:55.830
You can see up there,

37:55.849 --> 37:58.333
The date, it's rock-solid.

37:58.351 --> 38:00.018
Rick:
There you go.

38:00.112 --> 38:01.761
Doug:
You're saying
the science suggests

38:01.780 --> 38:04.764
That, basically, that well
could have been created

38:04.783 --> 38:06.116
At the same time

38:06.343 --> 38:08.860
As the disturbances
in the swamp,

38:09.012 --> 38:10.954
Because the bottom of your cores
in the swamp

38:11.181 --> 38:13.698
Were also coming out
in the 1200s.

38:13.792 --> 38:15.775
-That's the paved area.
-Yeah, the paved area.

38:15.794 --> 38:18.186
So this is a date
in the 12th century.

38:18.279 --> 38:19.779
-Is that right?
-Right.

38:19.798 --> 38:22.023
Doug:
So that well could be

38:22.116 --> 38:24.042
Contemporary with the swamp.

38:24.194 --> 38:25.360
Right.

38:25.453 --> 38:27.286
-Yeah.
-Yeah. The dates are

38:27.306 --> 38:28.638
All matching.

38:28.790 --> 38:31.641
-Right.
-That's very interesting.

38:31.868 --> 38:33.034
-Yeah.
-Doug: That is really cool.

38:33.053 --> 38:34.627
If that well is that old,

38:34.721 --> 38:36.871
I mean, you got to really think

38:36.890 --> 38:37.814
About what happened
on this island.

38:37.965 --> 38:39.482
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

38:39.709 --> 38:41.543
Well, like templars were here
or something.

38:41.561 --> 38:43.061
Well, there you go, jack.

38:43.213 --> 38:44.303
You-you got to wonder
what the story is.

38:44.323 --> 38:45.989
Templars, baby!

38:46.140 --> 38:48.307
(laughter)

38:48.327 --> 38:52.162
<i> Narrator:</i>
<i> Is it possible</i>
<i> that the well on lot 26,</i>

38:52.389 --> 38:55.573
<i> Along with other finds</i>
<i> made in recent years,</i>

38:55.725 --> 38:59.169
<i> Including</i>
<i> the 12th century paved area</i>

38:59.320 --> 39:02.822

39:02.916 --> 39:06.067
<i> The structure on lot 5,</i>

39:06.086 --> 39:10.922
<i> And even the stone carvings</i>

39:11.074 --> 39:12.907
<i> Validate the incredible theory</i>

39:13.000 --> 39:14.517
<i> That members</i>
<i> of the knights templar</i>

39:14.744 --> 39:17.095
<i> Visited oak island</i>
<i> on numerous occasions</i>

39:17.189 --> 39:20.582
<i> In order to hide</i>
<i> their sacred treasures?</i>

39:20.675 --> 39:23.509
Now we have connective tissue,
perhaps,

39:23.603 --> 39:27.346
<i> Between a very unique feature</i>
<i> on lot 26, the well,</i>

39:27.440 --> 39:30.367
<i>And the 1200 date in the swamp.</i>

39:30.594 --> 39:33.703
<i> Maybe even gold</i>
<i> in the money pit.</i>

39:33.930 --> 39:36.614
<i> And we might be close</i>
<i> to an answer here.</i>

39:36.708 --> 39:39.376
So, I'm very hopeful.

39:39.603 --> 39:41.436
I was shocked
when the numbers came out,

39:41.529 --> 39:43.121
And I'm hoping they can tell

39:43.273 --> 39:44.455
Part of the oak island story.

39:44.549 --> 39:45.773
Yeah.

39:45.867 --> 39:46.866
Rick:
That date may have

39:46.960 --> 39:49.386
Incredible impact,

39:49.613 --> 39:51.370
Uh, as we try
to make association

39:51.390 --> 39:52.889
With other areas on the island.

39:53.116 --> 39:54.449
Yeah.

39:54.542 --> 39:56.618
Rick:
And so we should have a plan

39:56.636 --> 39:57.802
To figure out
what this might mean.

39:57.954 --> 39:59.120
That's the way to do it.

39:59.213 --> 40:01.122
-Yeah.
-Jack: Why not try

40:01.141 --> 40:04.383
To section the area off and have
the archaeologists go in there,

40:04.403 --> 40:06.736
-So we can go section
by section?
-Craig: Yeah.

40:06.963 --> 40:10.131
We can find anything significant
in situ.

40:10.224 --> 40:12.300
-I agree.
-Laird: Yeah.

40:12.318 --> 40:13.726
I can do that
over the next few days.

40:13.820 --> 40:15.653
All right. So, with that,

40:15.747 --> 40:17.805
-Let's keep our eye on the ball
and...
-Mm-hmm.

40:17.899 --> 40:18.656
...And keep moving forward.

40:18.808 --> 40:19.974
Yep.

40:20.067 --> 40:21.476
Rick:
Okay. Let's go.

40:21.494 --> 40:23.002
Let's go.
