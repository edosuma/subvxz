WEBVTT

00:00.554 --> 00:03.524
- Previously on Lucifer...
- He is so into you.

00:03.526 --> 00:05.090
- You're joking.
- Uh, no.

00:05.092 --> 00:07.826
Scorching fire, five-alarm.

00:07.828 --> 00:10.229
I can see why Lucifer
is so affected by you.

00:10.231 --> 00:12.231
It's because you're special, Decker.

00:12.234 --> 00:14.466
Being a celestial insider...

00:14.468 --> 00:15.868
really sucks.

00:15.870 --> 00:19.004
I was in a really
dark place, but someone

00:19.006 --> 00:20.500
helped me gain perspective.

00:20.503 --> 00:23.175
Now Maze is off bounty hunting again.

00:23.177 --> 00:25.395
Being good takes practice.

00:25.398 --> 00:27.713
Keep at it and you'll get better.

00:27.715 --> 00:29.515
I guess I should take that job then.

00:29.517 --> 00:30.449
What job?

00:30.451 --> 00:32.149
The Sinnerman is not a myth.

00:32.152 --> 00:34.752
I butted heads with him in
Chicago. Did not end well.

00:34.755 --> 00:37.489
Not only did he stick my
wings back on and take my face,

00:37.492 --> 00:39.224
he's stolen my schtick, as well.

00:39.226 --> 00:40.723
He gives out favors to people.

00:40.726 --> 00:42.223
And I think that maybe

00:42.226 --> 00:44.396
it's about time I got back in the game.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074

Line's back there, buddy.

01:15.162 --> 01:16.695
Is the, uh,

01:16.697 --> 01:18.330
big guy in tonight?

01:20.868 --> 01:21.900
This is a one.

01:24.005 --> 01:25.804
Nice guy discount?

01:29.010 --> 01:30.509
Make it quick, kid.

01:31.929 --> 01:34.346
You're a prince.

01:34.348 --> 01:35.414
Thank you.

01:54.328 --> 01:55.426
Hey.

01:55.429 --> 01:57.202
Uh, Mr. Morningstar?

01:57.204 --> 01:58.937
I hear you're the guy to talk to.

01:58.939 --> 02:00.312
I hear you help people.

02:00.315 --> 02:01.874
What, like Ellen?

02:03.044 --> 02:04.379
I think not.

02:07.014 --> 02:09.145
No, I grant people favors.

02:09.148 --> 02:11.083
When it suits me.

02:11.085 --> 02:13.385
Well, I-I could use a favor.

02:14.889 --> 02:16.855
Hear me out, Mr. Morningstar.

02:16.857 --> 02:18.157
You won't regret it.

02:19.493 --> 02:22.227
Victoria, give us a
minute, would you, girl?

02:31.001 --> 02:32.434
Call me Lucifer.

02:32.437 --> 02:33.972
Joey Pileggi.

02:33.974 --> 02:35.674
So, Joey Pileggi,

02:35.676 --> 02:37.476
what is it you desire?

02:38.446 --> 02:41.387
Okay, so, how do you angels work?

02:41.390 --> 02:43.949
I know Amenadiel can slow time,

02:43.951 --> 02:47.219
and your other brother
Uriel could predict patterns.

02:47.221 --> 02:49.854
So why is your gift desire?

02:49.857 --> 02:51.690
Well,

02:51.692 --> 02:53.629
that's a good question,
actually, I suppose.

02:53.632 --> 02:55.627
When I first went to angel school,

02:55.629 --> 02:59.031
they sorted us into different
houses for different powers.

02:59.033 --> 03:00.599
There's a school for angels?

03:01.435 --> 03:03.068
No.

03:05.206 --> 03:07.364
There's no Hogwarts in the sky.

03:07.367 --> 03:09.775
Right. Obviously.

03:12.213 --> 03:15.881
Are you using humor to deflect
my very reasonable question?

03:15.883 --> 03:18.617
Look, if you must know,

03:18.619 --> 03:20.719
we were all born this way,

03:20.721 --> 03:23.348
each with our own God-given abilities.

03:23.351 --> 03:25.168
But what came first?

03:25.171 --> 03:28.060
Do angels' powers shape
their personalities?

03:28.062 --> 03:31.418
Or are your personalities
shaped by your powers?

03:31.421 --> 03:32.798
Haven't a clue.

03:34.235 --> 03:38.036
Look, all I know is that my
powers are perfect for me.

03:38.038 --> 03:40.305
Desire is the ultimate
expression of free will.

03:40.307 --> 03:44.215
I help people do whatever...
Or whomever... they want.

03:44.218 --> 03:45.878
But that's it?

03:47.181 --> 03:48.814
There isn't more to it?

03:59.727 --> 04:01.760
Sorry.

04:01.762 --> 04:04.428
- I-I should have knocked.
- It's a late night.

04:04.431 --> 04:05.798
Been trying to catch up on all the work

04:05.800 --> 04:07.080
since I got out of the hospital.

04:07.935 --> 04:09.668
Stole a couple hours on the couch.

04:10.738 --> 04:13.338
Um, thank you again...

04:13.340 --> 04:15.040
for saving my life.

04:15.042 --> 04:17.041
It's, uh...

04:17.043 --> 04:19.129
Looks like you're, you're
healing really well.

04:19.132 --> 04:21.414
It still hurts like a son of a bitch.

04:23.083 --> 04:24.283
You know what? I'll, um...

04:24.285 --> 04:25.645
I'll just come back another time.

04:25.648 --> 04:27.419
Now's good. What do you want, Decker?

04:31.225 --> 04:34.493
Uh, I wanted to request a personal day.

04:35.538 --> 04:36.871
What for?

04:36.874 --> 04:38.340
Well, it's personal.

04:38.343 --> 04:40.590
I'll take it under advisement.

04:40.593 --> 04:42.927
I didn't think it'd be an issue.

04:47.508 --> 04:49.808
It's just one personal day.

04:49.810 --> 04:51.710
I never ask for anything.

04:51.712 --> 04:53.278
You're too low-maintenance, Detective.

04:53.281 --> 04:55.380
People assume work is your only desire.

04:55.382 --> 04:56.882
Yeah, well, it's not.

04:56.884 --> 04:58.183
Yeah, what a jerk.

04:58.186 --> 05:00.153
Oh, look who's all hot and bothered.

05:00.156 --> 05:01.653
Someone got under your skin.

05:01.655 --> 05:04.022
What do you want with
a personal day anyway?

05:04.024 --> 05:05.601
It's personal.

05:07.695 --> 05:11.930
Looks like some sort of poor
man's penthouse, isn't it?

05:11.932 --> 05:13.465
Hmm.

05:13.467 --> 05:15.167
Boy, he's young.

05:15.169 --> 05:17.836
- Practically a kid.
- Yeah.

05:17.838 --> 05:21.173
What happened here? Who
would have done this?

05:21.175 --> 05:22.641
I'm afraid I might know.

05:24.812 --> 05:27.085
You see, I did this young man a favor.

05:28.776 --> 05:34.617

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

05:36.921 --> 05:39.090
Lucifer, can I talk to you?

05:41.619 --> 05:44.554
What exactly does this
have to do with you?

05:44.556 --> 05:46.464
Well, his name's Joey.

05:46.467 --> 05:48.791
Joey Pileggi, he came
to me a few months ago

05:48.793 --> 05:50.893
and asked me for a favor,
and I granted it to him.

05:50.895 --> 05:52.828
You're still doing that?

05:52.830 --> 05:55.498
I'd never stop granting
favors, Detective.

05:55.500 --> 05:57.944
I mean, I may have gotten
distracted for a while,

05:57.947 --> 06:00.136
but then I realized
granting favors defines me.

06:00.138 --> 06:02.374
I mean, you wouldn't
ask Superman not to fly?

06:02.377 --> 06:03.921
A Kardashian not to selfie?

06:03.924 --> 06:06.875
So I started up again and it
was going splendidly, until...

06:06.878 --> 06:10.212
What kind of favor? And don't
tell me it got Joey killed.

06:10.214 --> 06:13.215
Well, his desire was to
become the new Godfather,

06:13.217 --> 06:14.960
a Scarface for millennials.

06:14.963 --> 06:16.262
You introduced him to the mob?

06:16.265 --> 06:18.486
I may have gotten him an internship.

06:20.692 --> 06:21.757
Ella.

06:21.759 --> 06:23.693
What do you have on the cause of death?

06:23.695 --> 06:25.394
Two gunshot wounds to the chest,

06:25.396 --> 06:27.077
and his legs were broken.

06:27.080 --> 06:28.663
Practically shattered.

06:28.666 --> 06:31.266
But here's the weird part.
I thought that the killer

06:31.269 --> 06:33.069
broke Joey's legs first...
You know, torturing him

06:33.071 --> 06:34.737
before killing him... But look.

06:34.739 --> 06:36.405
Minimal hemorrhaging.

06:36.407 --> 06:37.840
That's when I realized

06:37.842 --> 06:40.152
Joey's legs were broken postmortem.

06:40.155 --> 06:43.344
Why? What's the killer trying to say?

06:43.347 --> 06:44.613
Oh, no.

06:44.616 --> 06:45.982
What?

06:45.984 --> 06:49.752
Well, it may be a commentary
on the job that I got for him.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.222
As a runner for the mob.

06:57.862 --> 07:00.663
- Angel school?
- Okay, what?

07:00.665 --> 07:02.264
It's not that funny, okay.

07:03.601 --> 07:06.436
Okay. Okay, it's kind of funny.

07:06.439 --> 07:08.971
You really thought
angel school was a thing?

07:08.973 --> 07:10.473
How was I supposed to know?

07:10.475 --> 07:11.878
What's crazier,

07:11.881 --> 07:14.862
angel school, or that you can slow time,

07:14.865 --> 07:17.199
or that Lucifer can draw
out people's desires?

07:17.202 --> 07:19.261
Okay, I can see how
that would seem strange.

07:19.264 --> 07:21.894
No, it's bananas, Amenadiel.

07:21.897 --> 07:23.819
I mean, how does any of it all work?

07:23.821 --> 07:25.287
Like...

07:25.289 --> 07:29.692
why is your power slowing down time?

07:31.829 --> 07:34.363
Maybe my Father wanted me
to be a better emissary,

07:34.365 --> 07:36.558
someone who could fix things on Earth

07:36.561 --> 07:37.933
and stay invisible.

07:37.935 --> 07:41.636
So, I can slow down
time and do His bidding

07:41.639 --> 07:43.606
without anyone being the wiser.

07:43.608 --> 07:46.776
That seems really...

07:46.778 --> 07:48.244
sad.

07:48.246 --> 07:49.879
- What do you mean?
- I mean,

07:49.881 --> 07:52.314
it... it just seems lonely

07:52.316 --> 07:56.986
to visit humanity without ever
really getting to know anyone.

07:57.989 --> 08:01.223
I guess I was never
told to avoid humanity.

08:03.227 --> 08:05.127
It just seemed easier.

08:06.798 --> 08:09.298
And quite honestly,
I never saw the point.

08:10.201 --> 08:11.827
Until recently.

08:13.738 --> 08:16.038
Hey, stranger...

08:16.040 --> 08:17.173
Maze!

08:17.175 --> 08:19.208
- You're back!
- Yeah!

08:19.210 --> 08:21.918
Oh, I missed you, too, girl.

08:21.921 --> 08:23.747
Where was your bounty
this time, Mazikeen?

08:23.750 --> 08:24.916
Uh, Cleveland.

08:24.919 --> 08:26.652
Now I'm banned in Ohio.

08:26.655 --> 08:28.818
Ah. So, uh, what's going on?

08:28.820 --> 08:30.131
What are you guys up to?

08:31.489 --> 08:32.955
Okay. Well, Linda...

08:32.957 --> 08:36.025
Linda was just catching
me up on how sh...

08:36.027 --> 08:39.662
on how she believed in "angel school."

08:39.664 --> 08:41.597
Oh.

08:41.599 --> 08:44.834
You... guys catch up, huh?

08:44.836 --> 08:47.362
Yes. Yeah, we... we've been hanging out.

08:47.365 --> 08:48.804
Yeah, we're friends.

08:49.707 --> 08:51.140
Right.

08:52.576 --> 08:54.376
Right. Friends.

08:55.446 --> 08:57.546
It's not just any shoe.

08:57.548 --> 08:59.749
Joey's high-tops were limited edition.

08:59.751 --> 09:01.870
Easily worth a grand a pair.

09:01.873 --> 09:03.940
I mean, my brothers
would flip over these.

09:03.943 --> 09:05.287
Sweet kicks indeed.

09:05.289 --> 09:06.949
Sorry I'm late.

09:06.952 --> 09:08.284
Charlotte.

09:08.287 --> 09:09.326
What are you doing here?

09:09.329 --> 09:10.960
Little early for opposing counsel.

09:10.962 --> 09:12.104
Are you defending someone?

09:12.107 --> 09:13.195
No.

09:13.197 --> 09:14.698
I quit my job.

09:14.701 --> 09:17.057
Oh. Well, good for you, Charlotte.

09:17.060 --> 09:18.100
Had enough of life

09:18.102 --> 09:19.735
as a corrupt defense lawyer, have you?

09:19.737 --> 09:21.504
That'll help keep your ledger clear.

09:21.506 --> 09:24.479
Today is my first day in the
district attorney's office...

09:24.482 --> 09:25.574
As a prosecutor.

09:25.576 --> 09:26.876
I'm on your side now.

09:26.878 --> 09:28.577
Surprise.

09:28.579 --> 09:29.745
Did you know about this?

09:29.747 --> 09:30.746
Not a clue.

09:30.748 --> 09:31.747
How did this happen?

09:31.749 --> 09:33.956
Who knows how these things happen?

09:33.959 --> 09:35.084
So random.

09:36.320 --> 09:38.346
Guess we should get
back to the case, right?

09:38.349 --> 09:39.855
- Right.
- Right.

09:39.857 --> 09:42.558
So, Joey had expensive shoes,

09:42.560 --> 09:43.893
plus...

09:43.895 --> 09:45.776
a real Rolex

09:45.779 --> 09:49.398
and ten grand stashed under his bed.

09:49.400 --> 09:50.566
But Joey worked for the mob.

09:50.568 --> 09:52.201
I mean, wouldn't that
explain all the swag?

09:52.203 --> 09:54.170
Runners for the mob don't
make that kind of money.

09:54.172 --> 09:55.838
There's no way he could afford that.

09:55.840 --> 09:58.340
Maybe Joey was skimming off the top.

09:59.443 --> 10:01.010
No, you don't have to raise your hand.

10:01.012 --> 10:03.712
Okay, well, um, his
bosses wouldn't like that.

10:03.714 --> 10:05.176
They would execute Joey

10:05.179 --> 10:07.245
to send a message to
the whole organization.

10:07.248 --> 10:09.409
Whoever brought him
in would do the deed.

10:09.412 --> 10:10.719
Lovely.

10:10.721 --> 10:12.904
What? I know how these guys work.

10:12.907 --> 10:15.174
I've represented mobsters
like this for years.

10:15.177 --> 10:17.326
Alleged mobsters.

10:17.328 --> 10:20.429
Who did you introduce Joey to?

10:20.431 --> 10:22.682
Frankie the Knife. Sweet chap.

10:22.685 --> 10:23.963
Sounds like a peach.

10:23.966 --> 10:25.277
All right, let's bring in Frankie

10:25.279 --> 10:27.237
and see where Joey's
education went wrong.

10:27.240 --> 10:28.437
Right.

10:30.007 --> 10:31.874
Okay, that was weird.

10:31.876 --> 10:33.342
Is it...

10:33.344 --> 10:35.010
weird for...

10:35.012 --> 10:36.512
us to be friends?

10:36.514 --> 10:39.048
No.

10:39.050 --> 10:41.050
Of course not.

10:41.052 --> 10:42.877
I mean, can't a...

10:42.880 --> 10:45.721
Can't a woman be friends with a...

10:45.723 --> 10:47.656
with a brilliant,

10:47.658 --> 10:49.859
tall,

10:49.861 --> 10:51.956
gorgeous angel?

10:51.959 --> 10:55.138
Well, can't an angel
be friends with a...

10:55.141 --> 10:58.309
amazing, accomplished...

10:59.003 --> 11:01.070
beautiful,

11:01.072 --> 11:02.982
and passionate woman?

11:17.748 --> 11:19.338
Um...

11:19.341 --> 11:21.326
I can't.

11:23.895 --> 11:25.668
This is a mistake.

11:28.065 --> 11:29.765
Okay.

11:29.767 --> 11:33.235
Okay.

11:33.237 --> 11:35.551
Okay. I'm so sorry, Linda.

11:43.080 --> 11:46.081
Detective, Lucifer.
Are you about to talk

11:46.083 --> 11:47.850
- to Frankie the Knife?
- Yep.

11:47.852 --> 11:49.466
Well, I can help. I know him.

11:49.468 --> 11:50.953
I defended him once.

11:50.955 --> 11:52.254
Unknown caller?

11:52.256 --> 11:53.489
Um...

11:53.491 --> 11:56.692
Look, why don't you give
the newbie a shot, Detective.

11:56.694 --> 11:59.002
I mean, I for one would love
an audience when I ream Frankie

11:59.004 --> 12:00.001
for what he did.

12:00.004 --> 12:01.730
No one will be reaming anyone.

12:01.732 --> 12:03.699
Fine, Charlotte.

12:03.701 --> 12:05.234
Just keep a low profile.

12:05.236 --> 12:06.635
You won't even know I'm there.

12:07.738 --> 12:10.039
Hello, Frankie.

12:10.041 --> 12:11.240
Mr. Ferrante.

12:11.242 --> 12:12.441
I'm Detective Decker.

12:12.443 --> 12:14.710
We know each other quite
well, don't we, Frankie?

12:14.712 --> 12:16.412
Not sure we've met, buddy.

12:16.414 --> 12:17.813
Oh, please.

12:17.815 --> 12:20.087
- And this is...
- Charlotte Richards?

12:20.090 --> 12:21.784
How are you? How are the kids?

12:21.786 --> 12:23.185
Hi, Frankie.

12:23.187 --> 12:24.853
Man, the guys are sure gonna be jealous

12:24.855 --> 12:26.337
when they hear you're defending me.

12:26.340 --> 12:27.923
Look, Frankie, I'm not your lawyer.

12:27.925 --> 12:29.558
I'm the prosecutor.

12:29.560 --> 12:31.074
I work with the cops now.

12:31.077 --> 12:32.628
Against you.

12:32.630 --> 12:34.196
What's the world coming to?

12:34.198 --> 12:35.331
Yeah, tell me about it.

12:35.333 --> 12:36.727
What happened, Frankie?

12:36.730 --> 12:38.767
You were supposed to
mentor Joey Pileggi,

12:38.769 --> 12:39.969
not kill him.

12:39.971 --> 12:41.603
I got no idea about any killing.

12:41.605 --> 12:43.238
Oh, did Joey steal from you,

12:43.240 --> 12:44.907
so you made a brutal example of him?

12:44.909 --> 12:46.041
Well, guess what?

12:46.043 --> 12:48.644
I love making brutal examples of people.

12:48.646 --> 12:50.045
Like I said,

12:50.047 --> 12:52.514
I don't know any Joey,
and I don't know you.

12:54.018 --> 12:55.582
You do know him.

12:59.162 --> 13:01.095
Yeah, I might've seen him once.

13:01.098 --> 13:02.458
It's hard to say.

13:02.460 --> 13:05.494
Is it true you're the head
of the Ferrante mob family?

13:05.496 --> 13:07.029
Well, come on.

13:07.031 --> 13:07.896
Answer her.

13:07.898 --> 13:09.531
You do not need to answer that.

13:09.533 --> 13:11.000
I don't?

13:12.403 --> 13:14.737
But it would be helpful if you did.

13:14.739 --> 13:16.605
Right. Enough of this
"bad cop, worse cop."

13:16.607 --> 13:19.174
Tell me, Frankie.

13:19.176 --> 13:21.043
What is it you really want?

13:22.513 --> 13:25.047
I want to find out
who killed little Joey,

13:25.049 --> 13:27.116
and I want payback.

13:28.019 --> 13:29.488
Oh.

13:31.889 --> 13:33.489
He was...

13:33.491 --> 13:35.224
He was such a good kid, that Joey.

13:35.226 --> 13:37.159
A real go-getter.

13:37.161 --> 13:39.251
We all loved him. He
had a real bright future.

13:39.254 --> 13:41.497
We found quite a bit
of contraband on him.

13:42.733 --> 13:44.833
Did he ever steal anything from you?

13:44.835 --> 13:46.568
Joey? Never.

13:46.570 --> 13:48.604
Everything he had he got from us.

13:48.607 --> 13:50.930
Oh, quite the lavish
employers, aren't you?

13:50.933 --> 13:54.043
Hey, me and the fellas, we're
real generous to our family.

13:54.045 --> 13:56.311
'Cause that's who he was: family.

13:57.715 --> 14:00.182
If there's anything I can do
to help with Joey's killer,

14:00.184 --> 14:02.718
you let me know, 'cause I
would love to bring him in.

14:02.720 --> 14:04.787
That means he would kill him.

14:04.789 --> 14:07.289
Oh, thank you, Charlotte.

14:08.691 --> 14:11.159
Thanks.

14:11.162 --> 14:13.695
- Hey, Chloe?
- Yes.

14:15.466 --> 14:17.032
I don't think Frankie's our guy.

14:17.034 --> 14:18.634
His alibi checks out.

14:18.636 --> 14:21.070
Look what just came in.

14:21.072 --> 14:22.871
Lucifer.

14:22.873 --> 14:24.473
We got another body.

14:24.475 --> 14:26.108
Let's go.

14:34.952 --> 14:38.062
Double tap to the chest, just like Joey.

14:38.065 --> 14:41.190
Detective, I know this woman.

14:41.192 --> 14:42.224
What?

14:42.226 --> 14:45.127
I did her a favor, too, years ago.

14:45.129 --> 14:48.931
This isn't just a murder.
It's another message.

14:48.933 --> 14:50.636
For me.

14:52.745 --> 14:55.812
Someone was definitely
sending a message.

14:55.815 --> 14:57.589
Frieda Marquez, 36.

14:57.591 --> 15:00.722
The noose was made out of her own hair.

15:00.725 --> 15:02.394
How twisted is that?

15:02.396 --> 15:04.596
But hanging wasn't what killed her.

15:04.598 --> 15:06.665
She died from two gunshots to the chest.

15:06.667 --> 15:08.600
So the killer arranged
her after he killed her,

15:08.602 --> 15:09.668
just like with Joey.

15:09.670 --> 15:11.303
We need to find the man

15:11.305 --> 15:12.737
who did this and punish him.

15:12.739 --> 15:14.272
Lucifer, what do you know about her?

15:14.274 --> 15:16.820
Frieda wanted to become a
hairstylist to the stars,

15:16.823 --> 15:19.945
so I made a few choice
introductions, that's all.

15:19.947 --> 15:22.547
I can't believe you knew Frieda.

15:22.549 --> 15:24.316
Her hair products are huge.

15:24.318 --> 15:26.318
She had salons all over the city,

15:26.320 --> 15:27.953
a whole beauty empire.

15:27.955 --> 15:29.921
I use her finishing cream every day.

15:29.923 --> 15:32.390
Right. Well, then I guess
she got what she wanted.

15:32.392 --> 15:33.458
Until now.

15:33.460 --> 15:35.760
Thanks, Ella.

15:35.762 --> 15:37.295
Can I talk to you?

15:37.297 --> 15:40.339
If these messages really
are for you, I'm worried.

15:40.342 --> 15:41.608
Who's sending them?

15:41.611 --> 15:43.089
What are they trying to say?

15:43.092 --> 15:45.804
Detective, I wasn't
entirely forthcoming earlier.

15:45.806 --> 15:49.007
The real reason I started
granting favors again

15:49.009 --> 15:50.642
was because of the Sinnerman.

15:50.644 --> 15:52.978
Lucifer, I've told you this before,

15:52.980 --> 15:55.313
I haven't seen any shred of evidence

15:55.315 --> 15:56.615
that this guy really exists.

15:56.617 --> 15:58.683
Well, now might be the
time to become a believer,

15:58.685 --> 16:01.486
because this appears to be his
way of escalating our rivalry.

16:01.488 --> 16:03.588
You think this is the
same guy that kidnapped you

16:03.590 --> 16:04.689
and dumped you in the desert?

16:04.691 --> 16:06.784
- Amongst other things, yes.
- Okay, well,

16:06.787 --> 16:08.365
I'm gonna need proof
that this guy is real.

16:08.367 --> 16:09.700
Oh, he is real.

16:09.703 --> 16:11.496
And very dangerous.

16:11.498 --> 16:13.532
His organization has been wreaking havoc

16:13.534 --> 16:14.966
in the Midwest for years.

16:14.968 --> 16:17.745
I ran into him in Chicago. I
couldn't get my hands on him.

16:17.748 --> 16:20.172
See? It's the one thing the
lieutenant and I agree on:

16:20.174 --> 16:21.625
our common enemy,

16:21.628 --> 16:22.774
the Sinnerman.

16:22.776 --> 16:24.109
So you two discussed this?

16:24.111 --> 16:25.340
When were you gonna fill me in?

16:25.342 --> 16:26.978
It's a need-to-know basis only, Decker.

16:26.980 --> 16:28.180
Feel free to blame me.

16:29.016 --> 16:30.115
- Hmm.
- The thing is,

16:30.117 --> 16:31.850
this does not seem like the Sinnerman.

16:31.852 --> 16:33.552
He kills for power and influence.

16:33.554 --> 16:36.430
Taunting a nightclub
owner seems petty, small.

16:36.433 --> 16:38.623
Well, perhaps you don't
know the full story.

16:40.081 --> 16:41.726
Okay, we're gonna treat this murder

16:41.728 --> 16:43.261
as we would any other crime:

16:43.263 --> 16:45.263
we follow the evidence
till we find the truth,

16:45.265 --> 16:46.698
Sinnerman or not.

16:46.700 --> 16:49.201
Sorry, but I don't have time for that.

16:49.203 --> 16:50.268
Lucifer,

16:50.270 --> 16:51.536
where are you going?

16:56.710 --> 16:58.243
Brother!

16:58.245 --> 17:00.245
I'm about to tear the
criminal underworld apart

17:00.247 --> 17:01.656
looking for this Sinnerman fellow.

17:01.659 --> 17:04.394
I'd appreciate your help. Call me back.

17:04.396 --> 17:06.851
Oh, also, it's Lucifer.

17:06.853 --> 17:08.720
Good luck with that.

17:08.722 --> 17:11.423
He's probably too busy
with Linda to answer.

17:11.425 --> 17:13.664
Mazikeen, you're back!

17:13.666 --> 17:15.926
I love the hair.

17:15.929 --> 17:17.166
Can we talk?

17:17.170 --> 17:19.564
We certainly can. Good
timing. I need your help.

17:19.566 --> 17:21.599
Hang on. Do you even care
what I was about to say?

17:21.602 --> 17:24.202
Of course I do. It's just that
my current problem is important.

17:24.204 --> 17:26.471
Well, how do you know
my thing isn't important?

17:26.473 --> 17:28.112
Okay. Fine. What is it?

17:28.115 --> 17:29.414
Did...

17:29.417 --> 17:31.543
Sorry, just...

17:31.545 --> 17:33.917
Telemarketers. They've
been hounding me all day.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.981
This won't take long. Hello?

17:35.983 --> 17:38.316
Unbelievable.

17:38.318 --> 17:40.018
Look, whatever it is you're selling,

17:40.020 --> 17:41.453
I'm not interested, so...

17:41.455 --> 17:43.421
Really?

17:43.423 --> 17:45.987
And I thought you were looking for me.

17:47.928 --> 17:50.462
It's the Sinnerman.

17:50.464 --> 17:52.631
You got the Sinnerman's DNA profile?

17:52.633 --> 17:55.333
- How?
- Our second vic, Frieda...

17:55.335 --> 17:56.568
Total fighter.

17:56.570 --> 17:58.670
She struggled with the
killer and scratched him.

17:58.672 --> 18:01.644
So I checked out her
fingernail scrapings and found

18:01.647 --> 18:03.574
blood and skin cells.

18:03.577 --> 18:05.495
And came up with the killer's DNA.

18:05.498 --> 18:07.946
Which matches a hair that I
recovered from Joey's place.

18:07.948 --> 18:09.614
So, boom,

18:09.616 --> 18:11.683
we can place the killer at both scenes.

18:11.685 --> 18:14.452
But, that's not even the cool part.

18:14.454 --> 18:17.889
I did some more digging
and found a perfect match

18:17.891 --> 18:19.691
with a blood spatter sample

18:19.693 --> 18:21.292
from an old Sinnerman case

18:21.295 --> 18:22.627
in Chicago.

18:22.630 --> 18:26.398
Proving that Pierce's Sinnerman
really is operating in L.A.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.159
Ella, you're a miracle worker.

18:28.162 --> 18:29.634
Aw, no biggie.

18:29.636 --> 18:33.071
My peeps in Detroit made some
calls to Chicago PD for me.

18:33.073 --> 18:35.540
Meant hours of sifting
through case files, but,

18:35.542 --> 18:37.042
you know, I just put on

18:37.044 --> 18:39.261
my Beastie Boys and powered through.

18:41.614 --> 18:44.482
Decker, did you hear what I said?

18:44.485 --> 18:45.750
What?

18:45.752 --> 18:47.252
Hmm? Sorry. No.

18:47.254 --> 18:48.901
Aw, never mind.

18:50.524 --> 18:52.023
Man, I can't believe nothing

18:52.025 --> 18:54.025
ever sparked between
you and the lieutenant.

18:54.027 --> 18:56.261
I could've sworn you guys had chemistry.

18:56.263 --> 18:57.796
No.

18:57.798 --> 18:59.197
No chemistry.

18:59.199 --> 19:01.866
- Well, win some, lose some, I guess.
- That's right.

19:01.868 --> 19:04.235
That is right. Okay,
I'm gonna call Lucifer.

19:04.237 --> 19:05.867
Awesome work. Hey, Lucifer,

19:05.870 --> 19:08.807
you were right. Call me back.
Try not to gloat too much.

19:08.809 --> 19:11.159
Oh, easy, Decker. What's the rush?

19:11.162 --> 19:12.161
Hey, Lieutenant.

19:12.164 --> 19:14.511
Um, so Ella found the Sinnerman's DNA

19:14.514 --> 19:16.614
at both scenes, and I
think we can use that

19:16.616 --> 19:17.849
to lean on Frankie Ferrante.

19:17.851 --> 19:19.451
That's promising.

19:19.453 --> 19:21.261
Where's Lucifer? You need help?

19:21.264 --> 19:22.430
I mean, I'm free.

19:22.433 --> 19:24.255
Oh, um...

19:24.257 --> 19:27.667
Oh, I'm-I'm good, thanks. I'm, um...

19:27.670 --> 19:30.036
I'm okay. I'm gonna...
I'm gonna take Charlotte.

19:32.232 --> 19:34.299
I'm sensing some tension here.

19:34.301 --> 19:35.934
Really?

19:35.936 --> 19:37.815
I'm not.

19:37.818 --> 19:40.105
I haven't forgotten about your
request for a personal day.

19:40.107 --> 19:41.873
Things have been crazy here.
I just haven't had a chance

19:41.875 --> 19:42.941
to look at the schedule yet.

19:42.943 --> 19:43.975
Yeah. No. All good.

19:43.977 --> 19:45.243
I haven't been thinking about that.

19:45.245 --> 19:46.711
I-I'm actually gonna take Charlotte

19:46.713 --> 19:48.380
'cause she's perfect for this.

19:48.382 --> 19:50.482
Keep me posted.

19:50.484 --> 19:52.083
Mm-hmm.

19:53.472 --> 19:54.986
You needed me, Detective?

19:54.988 --> 19:56.154
Sure do.

19:56.156 --> 19:57.822
Let's go.

20:25.519 --> 20:28.653
Oh, Sinnerman!

20:28.655 --> 20:30.388
Where are you?

20:33.860 --> 20:36.761
The slaughterhouse vibe
is a little try-hard,

20:36.763 --> 20:38.062
don't you think?

20:41.468 --> 20:43.802
You know, it's quite the party foul

20:43.804 --> 20:45.804
when the host doesn't even show up!

20:45.806 --> 20:47.448
In here.

20:50.558 --> 20:53.511
Ah, so what is it, hide-and-seek now?

20:58.785 --> 21:02.153
Come on, let's talk.

21:02.155 --> 21:05.557
That is, if you're
man enough to face me!

21:13.033 --> 21:15.940
I do love a captive audience.

21:22.075 --> 21:24.026
Oh.

21:26.174 --> 21:27.940
Well played.

21:30.261 --> 21:33.495
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

21:33.497 --> 21:35.397
Likewise.

21:35.399 --> 21:37.900
Always gratifying to find
out that one's nemesis

21:37.902 --> 21:39.847
is altogether lacking in style.

21:39.850 --> 21:41.403
Never been much of a dresser.

21:41.405 --> 21:43.439
I express myself through my work.

21:43.441 --> 21:46.608
I take it you're referring
to Frieda and Joey.

21:46.610 --> 21:48.877
Why harm them when you wanted me?

21:48.879 --> 21:52.715
Well, you can't have
a trap without bait,

21:52.717 --> 21:55.317
can you, now?

21:55.319 --> 21:59.488
I hate to toot my own
horn, but I got you good.

21:59.490 --> 22:00.656
Yes, indeed you did.

22:00.658 --> 22:02.925
Quite the mousetrap
you've laid out for me.

22:02.927 --> 22:04.925
And, unfortunately for you,

22:04.928 --> 22:06.294
I'm no mouse.

22:10.201 --> 22:12.334
And, unfortunately for you,

22:12.336 --> 22:15.904
that's a foot of reinforced steel.

22:15.906 --> 22:17.740
Takes a little extra

22:17.742 --> 22:19.341
to hold the Devil.

22:19.343 --> 22:22.644
Who are you?

22:22.646 --> 22:25.748
How did you return my
wings and steal my face?

22:25.750 --> 22:27.483
Hmm.

22:27.485 --> 22:29.118
You're just chock-full

22:29.120 --> 22:30.352
of questions, aren't you?

22:30.354 --> 22:32.988
Questions I'll answer in time,

22:32.990 --> 22:35.157
'cause you should have plenty of that.

22:35.159 --> 22:38.761
This place has been abandoned
for at least ten years.

22:38.763 --> 22:41.479
Maybe they'll knock it
down with you still in it.

22:44.034 --> 22:46.702
I tell you what, why don't you
take your sunglasses off, hmm?

22:46.704 --> 22:49.464
Then we can have a proper conversation.

22:52.073 --> 22:55.010
Want to do your little desire shtick?

22:55.012 --> 22:57.713
Let me save us both some time.

22:57.715 --> 23:02.684
I like redheads, strawberries,
and long walks on the beach.

23:03.910 --> 23:06.521
I've got work to do, now
that you're all checked in.

23:06.524 --> 23:09.291
I don't have time for parlor tricks.

23:09.293 --> 23:11.644
Right.

23:11.647 --> 23:14.008
You hide behind your glasses,

23:14.011 --> 23:16.365
but know this...

23:16.367 --> 23:18.734
When I find out what
someone truly desires,

23:18.736 --> 23:21.136
I find out their greatest weakness.

23:21.138 --> 23:24.406
And that's not a
parlor trick, Sinnerman.

23:24.408 --> 23:25.541
It's power.

23:25.543 --> 23:27.142
Hmm.

23:27.144 --> 23:28.610
And I promise you

23:28.612 --> 23:31.831
I will find out what you really want,

23:31.834 --> 23:34.134
and when I do,

23:34.137 --> 23:36.718
I'm going to use it to destroy you.

23:36.720 --> 23:39.183
Yeah.

23:41.292 --> 23:44.259
I'm right here, pal.

23:44.261 --> 23:45.847
What do you got?

23:47.097 --> 23:48.630
Too slow.

23:48.632 --> 23:50.284
Why?!

23:52.448 --> 23:53.735
Why are you doing this?

23:53.737 --> 23:56.305
You'll see.

23:56.307 --> 23:57.439
No!

23:59.011 --> 24:00.642
The reason I asked you

24:00.644 --> 24:02.444
to come along is
'cause you know Frankie.

24:02.446 --> 24:04.246
I really need you to
work that connection.

24:04.248 --> 24:05.647
He won't know what hit him.

24:05.649 --> 24:08.550
Wait. Can you stick to the script

24:08.552 --> 24:11.186
and say exactly what I told you to say?

24:11.188 --> 24:13.088
Well, of course. I'm not an idiot.

24:13.090 --> 24:14.523
Let's go.

24:20.764 --> 24:22.965
Last time we talked, you
wished there was a way

24:22.967 --> 24:24.433
that you could help with Joey's death.

24:24.435 --> 24:26.034
Well, there is.

24:26.036 --> 24:27.903
Our prime suspect is

24:27.905 --> 24:31.106
a criminal who calls
himself the Sinnerman.

24:36.575 --> 24:37.913
Doesn't ring a bell.

24:37.915 --> 24:39.381
Frankie,

24:39.383 --> 24:41.383
you know that you and your people

24:41.385 --> 24:43.018
are not under investigation here.

24:43.020 --> 24:44.486
We just want a way to find this guy.

24:44.488 --> 24:48.901
The Sinnerman is known to
have entrepreneurial ties.

24:48.904 --> 24:50.504
Did you ever cross paths with him?

24:50.507 --> 24:53.195
Well, Louie here crosses paths
with the Cinnabon once a week.

24:53.197 --> 24:55.065
Can't get enough of
'em. Am I right, Louie?

24:55.068 --> 24:56.732
Yeah.

24:56.734 --> 25:00.102
If you help us out, I promise
it'll be worth your while.

25:00.104 --> 25:01.670
- Charlotte, we can't do that.
- Look,

25:01.672 --> 25:04.206
Frankie, come on, handy
for an entrepreneur like you

25:04.208 --> 25:05.741
to have friends in the DA's office.

25:08.757 --> 25:09.789
Sorry, ladies.

25:09.792 --> 25:11.574
- Wish I could help.
- Cut the crap, Frankie.

25:11.577 --> 25:13.617
- Give us something.
- Charlotte...

25:13.620 --> 25:16.118
Thank you, Mr. Ferrante, for your time.

25:17.254 --> 25:18.353
Good evening, gentlemen.

25:18.355 --> 25:19.621
Good night, ladies.

25:24.361 --> 25:26.295
I'm sorry, Detective Decker.

25:26.297 --> 25:28.292
I know I went off script a bit,

25:28.295 --> 25:30.464
but I wanted to get you what you needed.

25:30.467 --> 25:31.666
And I didn't.

25:31.669 --> 25:33.068
Charlotte, are you kidding me?

25:33.071 --> 25:34.471
You were perfect.

25:34.474 --> 25:37.372
Frankie had to make sure that
we weren't coming after him,

25:37.374 --> 25:39.487
and coming from you, he believed it.

25:39.490 --> 25:41.756
Mobsters like that... They
don't talk to the cops.

25:41.759 --> 25:43.276
Then what was the point of that?

25:43.279 --> 25:45.378
How does this get us any
closer to the Sinnerman?

25:45.381 --> 25:47.269
Frankie obviously cares about Joey.

25:47.272 --> 25:48.605
He's gonna want to get revenge.

25:48.608 --> 25:51.152
I think he's gonna find
the Sinnerman on his own.

25:51.155 --> 25:53.188
And when he does...

25:53.190 --> 25:54.534
you'll be waiting.

25:56.126 --> 25:58.987
You expected me to fail, didn't you?

25:58.990 --> 26:01.620
Why didn't you just
trust me with the truth?

26:01.623 --> 26:03.565
Charlotte, you know
the things you've done.

26:03.567 --> 26:06.101
You know the reasons I can't trust you.

26:06.103 --> 26:09.595
Huh. I suppose... I do.

26:09.598 --> 26:11.073
And, look, I want to believe

26:11.075 --> 26:12.841
that this change of heart is for real,

26:12.843 --> 26:16.345
but you're gonna have to
earn that trust back, okay?

26:16.347 --> 26:18.013
This is a good start, though.

26:20.217 --> 26:22.751
I got to stay here and watch Frankie,

26:22.753 --> 26:25.696
but let me call you a
car, get you a ride home.

26:25.699 --> 26:27.399
I'll find my own way home.

26:27.402 --> 26:28.801
Good night.

26:28.804 --> 26:30.931
Oh. Night.

26:37.947 --> 26:39.179
Hey, Pierce.

26:39.182 --> 26:41.015
You still working that Ferrante angle?

26:41.018 --> 26:42.585
Uh, yeah, I am.

26:42.588 --> 26:44.588
It's turned into a stakeout. But why?

26:44.591 --> 26:46.165
'Cause I brought food.

26:49.013 --> 26:50.837
Mind if I join you?

26:55.252 --> 26:57.853
Come on.

26:57.855 --> 26:59.755
Oh...

26:59.757 --> 27:01.690
So this is your diabolical plan?

27:01.692 --> 27:03.358
Is it? Hmm?

27:03.360 --> 27:05.460
To bore me to death?!

27:07.064 --> 27:09.454
Lucifer?

27:09.457 --> 27:12.157
Lucifer, I know you're in here.

27:12.160 --> 27:13.893
In here!

27:18.575 --> 27:20.006
Maze!

27:20.009 --> 27:22.711
Oh, you're a sight for sore eyes.

27:22.713 --> 27:24.546
I didn't realize you
still kept tabs on me.

27:24.548 --> 27:25.914
What are you talking about?

27:25.916 --> 27:28.517
I tracked you down because I
have a bone to pick with you.

27:28.519 --> 27:30.952
- What?
- I asked you to talk.

27:30.954 --> 27:34.389
And you blow me off
and hide in a freezer?

27:34.391 --> 27:36.625
I thought we were past all of this.

27:36.627 --> 27:39.027
Oh, sure, yeah, thought
I'd just hang around in here

27:39.029 --> 27:41.730
like a frozen side of
beef just to avoid you.

27:41.732 --> 27:44.321
Hello! I was a prisoner!

27:44.324 --> 27:46.324
The Sinnerman had me trapped here.

27:46.327 --> 27:47.602
Uh...

27:47.604 --> 27:49.337
Now would you please just stand aside?

27:49.339 --> 27:51.173
I need to figure out what he's up to,

27:51.175 --> 27:53.108
and I've already lost
enough time as it is.

27:53.110 --> 27:54.509
Hang on. You were trapped?

27:54.511 --> 27:57.188
Well, obviously!

28:01.009 --> 28:02.050
Maze!

28:04.588 --> 28:06.040
Oh, for...

28:08.060 --> 28:11.323
Maze! Come on, open up!

28:11.326 --> 28:13.995
I've got places to go, people to hurt!

28:13.997 --> 28:17.432
Just think of someone
else's needs for a change!

28:17.434 --> 28:19.234
Can you hear?

28:19.236 --> 28:21.736
You're going nowhere, Lucifer.

28:21.738 --> 28:25.907
You don't get out until you
listen to what I have to say,

28:25.909 --> 28:28.610
and act like you care.

28:30.280 --> 28:32.814
Can't believe this.

28:37.087 --> 28:38.787
What's on your mind, Maze?

28:38.789 --> 28:42.862
Did you know that Linda
and Amenadiel are a thing?

28:43.861 --> 28:45.993
Linda and Amenadiel are doing what now?

28:45.996 --> 28:47.963
How'd you know? What makes you say that?

28:47.965 --> 28:49.130
Well, I saw them

28:49.132 --> 28:50.665
in her office.

28:50.667 --> 28:53.003
"Talking."

28:53.006 --> 28:55.036
They were clearly about to bone.

28:55.038 --> 28:57.172
Right, you do realize

28:57.174 --> 29:00.308
that talking in her office
is literally Linda's job?

29:03.914 --> 29:05.776
Interesting point.

29:05.779 --> 29:07.379
Hmm, isn't it?

29:07.382 --> 29:08.881
And, you know, so what

29:08.884 --> 29:11.418
if Amenadiel is playing
doctor with the doctor?

29:11.421 --> 29:13.255
So our old flames are having a fling.

29:13.257 --> 29:14.823
I don't care. Why should you?

29:17.050 --> 29:18.683
Unless...

29:20.121 --> 29:22.662
Unless you're still hot for angel?

29:22.665 --> 29:23.998
- No!
- No?

29:24.001 --> 29:25.245
- No!
- Ah.

29:25.248 --> 29:27.348
Well, I... I mean, she's just...

29:27.351 --> 29:30.404
my best friend, and he's my ex.

29:30.407 --> 29:31.907
I don't like it.

29:31.909 --> 29:34.476
So, you don't want him, but
nobody else can have him.

29:34.478 --> 29:36.011
That's awfully greedy of you, Maze.

29:36.013 --> 29:38.013
I've been gone for too long, okay?

29:38.015 --> 29:41.320
I just need to know what
the hell is going on.

29:41.323 --> 29:43.919
And what would you do if you knew?

29:43.922 --> 29:45.932
Hmm?

29:49.059 --> 29:52.761
Look, you really want
my advice, Mazikeen?

29:52.763 --> 29:56.464
Ask yourself what you truly desire.

29:56.466 --> 29:58.366
And be honest. Otherwise,
there's no point.

30:01.605 --> 30:03.605
Maze?

30:03.607 --> 30:05.707
Mazikeen?

30:05.709 --> 30:07.503
You still there?

30:15.419 --> 30:16.751
Thanks, Lucifer.

30:16.753 --> 30:19.187
Great talk. Glad I
could help. Got to go.

30:21.525 --> 30:23.292
I wonder when Frankie's

30:23.295 --> 30:25.195
gonna make his move.

30:25.198 --> 30:28.095
Soon. Bet they're reaching
out to their sources,

30:28.098 --> 30:29.965
probably calling the
Sinnerman right now.

30:34.628 --> 30:36.609
All right.

30:36.612 --> 30:38.239
Out with it, Decker.

30:38.241 --> 30:40.041
I either have food in my teeth,

30:40.043 --> 30:42.210
or you have something
you want to say to me.

30:43.513 --> 30:46.114
Why is this case so important to you?

30:46.116 --> 30:48.018
It's not.

30:48.021 --> 30:49.620
It's a high-priority case, and...

30:51.511 --> 30:53.053
I need to display leadership

30:53.056 --> 30:55.090
to the suits downtown. That's all.

30:55.092 --> 30:58.593
Really? Showing up out of
nowhere while I'm on a stakeout?

30:58.596 --> 30:59.794
You said it yourself.

30:59.796 --> 31:02.198
You and the Sinnerman
crossed paths in Chicago.

31:02.201 --> 31:03.865
This is personal, isn't it?

31:06.570 --> 31:08.401
It is.

31:09.873 --> 31:11.854
The Sinnerman killed my brother.

31:14.811 --> 31:16.409
I'm sorry.

31:18.813 --> 31:21.847
I thought I could run
away from the pain of it.

31:21.850 --> 31:24.152
From him.

31:24.154 --> 31:26.955
Now I know that I can't anymore,

31:26.957 --> 31:30.518
so I need to find him and
make him pay for what he did.

31:32.696 --> 31:36.197
Do you know why I asked
for that personal day?

31:36.199 --> 31:37.690
The anniversary of

31:37.693 --> 31:39.793
my father's death is coming up.

31:41.226 --> 31:43.493
And, uh, he was killed on duty.

31:45.542 --> 31:47.776
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

31:47.778 --> 31:49.429
It was a long time ago.

31:49.432 --> 31:51.346
But just a few months ago,

31:51.348 --> 31:53.515
we finally found the guy who did it.

31:54.817 --> 31:57.684
And I had dreamed of
that moment for so long.

31:57.687 --> 31:59.734
Also kind of dreaded it.

31:59.737 --> 32:02.624
I mean, he caused my
family so much pain.

32:02.626 --> 32:05.385
When I finally found him, I...

32:05.388 --> 32:07.862
I didn't know what I'd do.

32:07.864 --> 32:09.697
What did you do?

32:09.699 --> 32:12.767
I did the right thing.

32:12.769 --> 32:14.769
I arrested him.

32:14.771 --> 32:16.538
But it wasn't easy.

32:18.108 --> 32:19.941
I get it.

32:19.943 --> 32:23.678
I know why you don't
talk about this stuff.

32:23.680 --> 32:27.348
I don't, either, not even to Lucifer.

32:27.350 --> 32:29.198
It's just too painful.

32:32.989 --> 32:35.056
Think about what you really want.

32:37.160 --> 32:39.928
Don't do anything you're gonna regret.

32:42.099 --> 32:44.557
I guess I have to give you

32:44.560 --> 32:46.234
that personal day now.

32:48.905 --> 32:50.972
Heads up, we got someone.

32:50.974 --> 32:53.108
He doesn't look like a mobster.

32:53.110 --> 32:55.343
Maybe one of their
sources. Let's hang tight.

32:55.345 --> 32:56.611
Copy that.

32:56.613 --> 32:57.979
Lucifer.

32:57.981 --> 32:59.214
Detective.

32:59.216 --> 33:01.116
Finally. Look, I'm on a stakeout.

33:01.119 --> 33:02.004
You were right.

33:02.007 --> 33:03.550
The Sinnerman is behind this.

33:03.553 --> 33:04.776
You don't say.

33:04.779 --> 33:06.412
I've just gotten out of cold storage

33:06.415 --> 33:07.922
after being grabbed by him again.

33:07.924 --> 33:10.091
- What? Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

33:10.093 --> 33:13.061
Just dying to crush that
pathetic excuse for a man.

33:13.063 --> 33:15.163
You saw him? What does he look like?

33:15.165 --> 33:16.628
Black fellow, early 40s,

33:16.631 --> 33:18.231
though he dresses like an old man.

33:18.234 --> 33:20.167
Would you believe he
wore a sweater vest?

33:20.170 --> 33:21.535
His greatest crime yet.

33:21.538 --> 33:23.605
That's not a source, that's him.

33:24.307 --> 33:25.940
Let's go.

33:25.942 --> 33:27.742
Wait, Detective.

33:27.744 --> 33:29.577
Detective?

33:31.515 --> 33:33.292
Bloody hell.

33:45.043 --> 33:47.543
Drop the weapon.

33:49.743 --> 33:51.047
I'm on him! Cut him off!

33:51.049 --> 33:52.501
Chloe, wait!

34:08.498 --> 34:11.333
We've got units outside!

34:11.335 --> 34:13.936
If you give up now, we
can take you in safely.

34:13.938 --> 34:15.571
But this is so much fun.

34:17.342 --> 34:20.543
Oh. Where are you?

34:20.545 --> 34:21.860
Where are you?

34:51.726 --> 34:53.842
Do what you got to do.

34:54.779 --> 34:56.212
Pierce, wait.

35:00.485 --> 35:02.918
Hey.

35:02.920 --> 35:04.854
Let me help you.

35:11.829 --> 35:13.963
You already did.

35:17.168 --> 35:19.201
You're under arrest.

35:19.203 --> 35:21.270
Let's go.

35:38.890 --> 35:40.256
Detective.

35:40.258 --> 35:43.159
You're okay. What happened?

35:43.161 --> 35:44.412
We got him. What?

35:44.415 --> 35:46.562
You did it. You got the Sinnerman.

35:46.564 --> 35:48.845
Actually, Pierce did.

35:50.835 --> 35:52.668
Right.

35:52.670 --> 35:54.603
Right. Well, where-where is he?

35:55.640 --> 35:57.339
He's, um...

36:01.312 --> 36:02.812
I want to talk to him.

36:03.813 --> 36:05.714
Lucifer.

36:05.716 --> 36:07.416
Don't worry.

36:07.418 --> 36:09.051
You'll get your chance.

36:09.053 --> 36:11.259
Officer, he's ready.

36:30.023 --> 36:31.766
Linda, you there?

36:36.696 --> 36:38.412
What's up?

36:38.415 --> 36:40.515
Are you alone?

36:40.518 --> 36:42.184
Yeah. Why?

36:42.186 --> 36:45.988
'Cause you're acting kind of strange.

36:45.990 --> 36:47.623
What's going on?

36:49.594 --> 36:50.960
Uh...

36:52.997 --> 36:55.162
I should have told you this earlier,

36:55.165 --> 36:58.677
but it was... weird

36:58.680 --> 37:02.385
seeing you and Amenadiel so... chummy.

37:02.388 --> 37:04.920
Oh. Were we?

37:04.923 --> 37:06.942
Yeah, you were.

37:06.944 --> 37:09.435
Made me feel like beating
the crap out of him.

37:09.438 --> 37:11.813
Or at least throwing rocks at cars.

37:11.816 --> 37:13.415
But, no, I didn't.

37:14.385 --> 37:16.218
I came to tell you how I feel.

37:16.220 --> 37:17.553
Yes.

37:17.555 --> 37:20.022
Please. Tell me.

37:21.359 --> 37:23.826
Okay. Um...

37:23.828 --> 37:27.796
I've been thinking about it all day.

37:27.798 --> 37:30.165
You're my best friend, you know?

37:30.167 --> 37:32.234
And he's my ex.

37:32.236 --> 37:34.349
And by-by "ex," I mean, like,

37:34.352 --> 37:37.217
one of a million ex-sexual partners

37:37.220 --> 37:40.743
and not anything special.

37:40.745 --> 37:44.880
Any-Anyway, um...

37:44.882 --> 37:48.918
it makes me feel left out.

37:48.920 --> 37:52.256
So I don't want you two getting together

37:52.259 --> 37:54.157
if that's possible.

37:55.960 --> 37:57.159
I understand.

37:58.866 --> 38:00.966
You have nothing to worry about.

38:02.033 --> 38:04.066
Thank you.

38:04.068 --> 38:07.803
I figured you wouldn't want
my sloppy seconds, anyway.

38:07.805 --> 38:11.607
And you know me, I was
all over that angel.

38:11.609 --> 38:13.029
I went in deep.

38:13.032 --> 38:15.144
Used every tool

38:15.146 --> 38:17.176
in that Swiss Army knife.

38:17.179 --> 38:18.879
Know what I mean?

38:19.817 --> 38:23.252
I touched nerves that
he never knew he had.

38:23.254 --> 38:25.266
I can only imagine.

38:25.269 --> 38:27.156
Yeah.

38:27.158 --> 38:28.557
Anyway...

38:31.329 --> 38:32.962
You're the best, Linda.

38:43.107 --> 38:44.790
You okay in there?

38:46.711 --> 38:48.811
Um...

38:48.813 --> 38:50.879
I'm-I'm fine.

38:50.881 --> 38:54.450
Thank you, Detective Espinoza.

38:54.452 --> 38:55.851
Charlotte?

38:55.853 --> 38:57.753
I just needed a moment.

38:57.755 --> 39:00.189
And I thought that this was...

39:00.191 --> 39:03.359
the one place that I
wouldn't be disturbed.

39:03.361 --> 39:06.161
I don't want to pry, but, uh,

39:06.163 --> 39:08.897
you don't seem fine.

39:10.334 --> 39:13.602
I'm not.

39:13.604 --> 39:15.804
I switched to prosecution

39:15.806 --> 39:17.940
to try and be a better person...

39:17.942 --> 39:20.009
but I'm not helping anyone.

39:20.011 --> 39:23.812
I just keep screwing things up.

39:23.814 --> 39:27.983
I was really good at being the old me.

39:27.985 --> 39:30.986
The best.

39:30.988 --> 39:35.357
But I know I need to make a change.

39:35.359 --> 39:37.615
And I suck at it.

39:40.731 --> 39:43.779
No one expects you to change overnight.

39:45.736 --> 39:49.271
It's hard to be one of the good guys.

39:49.273 --> 39:51.440
Look, I screw up, too.

39:51.442 --> 39:54.910
I've made plenty of
mistakes, believe me.

39:54.912 --> 39:58.061
But I don't quit...

39:58.064 --> 40:00.413
and I know that counts for something.

40:02.777 --> 40:04.543
At least you're trying, right?

40:17.034 --> 40:18.464
Thank you, Dan.

40:18.467 --> 40:20.536
Don't mention it.

40:24.490 --> 40:26.375
Oh, hey, Hernandez.

40:29.397 --> 40:31.380
I'm in the men's room, aren't I?

40:31.382 --> 40:32.681
Oh, yeah.

41:52.863 --> 41:54.663
My, my...

41:54.665 --> 41:57.566
how the tables have turned.

41:57.568 --> 42:01.637
I don't know if you remember,
but I made you a promise:

42:01.639 --> 42:04.039
to look into your eyes and find out

42:04.041 --> 42:07.242
what the great Sinnerman desires...

42:07.244 --> 42:08.977
and then take it from him.

42:12.516 --> 42:15.284
I'm a man of my word, so
let's get to it, shall we?

42:17.256 --> 42:18.954
Look at me.

42:21.397 --> 42:24.339
Look into my eyes!

42:38.776 --> 42:41.476
Now...

42:41.478 --> 42:44.346
you'll never know what I want.

42:44.348 --> 42:46.378
But...

42:48.779 --> 42:50.120
Code Twenty!

42:50.123 --> 42:51.186
Twenty!

42:51.188 --> 42:52.354
Code Twenty!

42:52.356 --> 42:54.238
Somebody get a medic in here!
