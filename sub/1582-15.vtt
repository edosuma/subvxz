00:09.437 --> 00:10.570
Hm... hmm?!

00:10.604 --> 00:12.672
"Lisa wants

00:12.706 --> 00:15.809
"a dot-dot-dot

00:15.843 --> 00:16.910
guinea pig"?

00:16.944 --> 00:18.077
Mm.

00:29.757 --> 00:33.059
Hey, Homer, did you know that
guinea pigs are self-groomers?

00:33.093 --> 00:35.094
And when the get excited,
they jump straight up.

00:35.129 --> 00:37.764
It's called "popcorning."
Lisa got to you.

00:37.798 --> 00:39.666
I don't know how,
but she got to you.

00:43.437 --> 00:44.938
Emojis.

00:44.972 --> 00:47.273
Now she's gone too far.

00:48.576 --> 00:50.543
Lisa, your father and I
are very concerned

00:50.578 --> 00:52.479
about all this hinting.

00:53.681 --> 00:55.448
I've never had
a pet of my very own.

00:55.483 --> 00:56.850
My clock is ticking.

00:56.884 --> 00:58.418
I don't want to be
one of those girls

00:58.452 --> 01:00.153
who waits till she's 16
to decide if she's ready,

01:00.187 --> 01:02.021
and then it's too late.

01:03.090 --> 01:04.424
Well, we've talked about it.

01:04.458 --> 01:06.292
And if you really
want a guinea pig,

01:06.327 --> 01:08.027
you'll have to sign
this contract.

01:09.330 --> 01:11.798
"I, Lisa Simpson, hereby promise

01:11.832 --> 01:14.133
to take full responsibility
for this dog, cat, other."

01:14.168 --> 01:15.335
Circle "other."

01:15.369 --> 01:17.370
"This includes
feeding, bathing,

01:17.404 --> 01:19.072
"cleaning of droppings
and barfings,

01:19.106 --> 01:22.942
and when the time comes,
burying or flushing."

01:22.977 --> 01:24.711
Boilerplate,
boilerplate, boilerplate.

01:24.745 --> 01:26.679
We can skip
all this litter box stuff.

01:26.714 --> 01:28.281
"If pet
becomes Internet superstar,

01:28.315 --> 01:29.749
all rights revert to father."

01:29.783 --> 01:30.984
Sign here, here,

01:31.018 --> 01:32.452
initial here, one
more over here.

01:32.486 --> 01:33.887
And done.

01:33.921 --> 01:34.921
Oh, my God!

01:34.955 --> 01:36.389
I'm getting a guinea pig!

01:36.423 --> 01:37.390
Thank you, thank you, thank you,

01:37.424 --> 01:38.458
thank you, thank you!

01:38.492 --> 01:40.460
The kid-parent contract.

01:40.494 --> 01:42.195
Unenforceable, yet you feel

01:42.229 --> 01:45.265
like you didn't completely cave.

01:45.290 --> 01:50.290
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==
<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

01:55.776 --> 01:58.411
You're doing the right thing
adopting a rescue pig.

01:58.445 --> 02:00.346
You know, most of these guys
are rejects

02:00.381 --> 02:03.349
from the big guinea-pig mills
in the Midwest.

02:03.384 --> 02:05.685
Oh, I can't tell you
how many mill pigs

02:05.719 --> 02:08.955
we get in here who have
bumblefoot or the slobbers.

02:08.989 --> 02:11.357
You don't have
children, do you?

02:11.392 --> 02:12.992
This one whistled at me!

02:13.027 --> 02:15.061
Ooh, that could
be the one.

02:15.095 --> 02:18.264
Oh, but that orange guy
looks like a pumpkin.

02:18.299 --> 02:20.767
But this fellow is so fuzzy!

02:20.801 --> 02:24.537
Well, they all have
their charms.

02:24.572 --> 02:26.439
This one's nibbling
a sunflower seed.

02:26.473 --> 02:27.707
Look at that hair.

02:27.741 --> 02:29.642
Aw, I just want
to comb it forever!

02:29.677 --> 02:32.145
Have you seen a pinker nose?

02:32.179 --> 02:34.147
I have now!

02:34.181 --> 02:36.950
Lisa, you've just
got to choose <i>one.</i>

02:36.984 --> 02:38.084
Lisa?

02:38.118 --> 02:40.420
She's gone, honey.
She's gone.

02:40.454 --> 02:42.522
That one's fur looks
like a tuxedo!

02:42.556 --> 02:45.458
A Band-Aid on its tail, aw!

02:45.492 --> 02:48.895
Albino!

02:48.929 --> 02:50.530
I'm definitely
getting this one.

02:50.564 --> 02:52.031
Oh, but I forgot
about this one.

02:52.066 --> 02:54.300
Oh, my God,
I never even saw this one!

02:54.335 --> 02:57.236
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh...

02:57.271 --> 02:59.839
Maybe I should get
that sick one.

02:59.873 --> 03:01.341
If I don't, no one else will.

03:01.375 --> 03:04.043
Bart, list your top five,
best to worst.

03:04.078 --> 03:05.511
No, no, no, no!
Worst to best.

03:05.546 --> 03:08.781
I just wish the gray one had
the brown one's personality.

03:08.816 --> 03:10.049
Okay, Dad, give me your phone.

03:10.084 --> 03:11.250
I need to look
at the pictures again.

03:11.285 --> 03:12.952
Aw, aw, aw!

03:12.987 --> 03:15.321
Aw, aw!

03:16.724 --> 03:18.358
Okay, this is the guinea pig

03:18.392 --> 03:20.693
that will make me happy.

03:20.728 --> 03:22.228
She thinks
she's decided.

03:22.262 --> 03:23.663
Don't say a thing.

03:23.697 --> 03:25.431
Don't blow this.

03:25.466 --> 03:28.668
Okay, now, you sure
you only want just one?

03:28.702 --> 03:31.437
They tend
to do better in pairs.

03:31.472 --> 03:34.307
I could get two?

03:35.509 --> 03:39.112
Farting tweakers rule!

03:39.146 --> 03:41.280
I've tried to give Pokey
a perfect replica

03:41.315 --> 03:43.082
of his natural habitat.

03:43.117 --> 03:44.250
Peruvian feather grass,

03:44.284 --> 03:45.718
an Incan sleeping mat,

03:45.753 --> 03:47.320
and a portrait of
Marisol Espinoza,

03:47.354 --> 03:49.288
the Vice President of Peru.

03:49.323 --> 03:52.025
Are you sure you didn't create
a perfect habitat for you?

03:52.059 --> 03:53.826
I wish I could
live in there.

03:53.861 --> 03:55.261
Well, there's
plenty of room

03:55.295 --> 03:57.130
because Pokey's gone.

03:57.164 --> 03:59.265
Where'd he go?

04:05.973 --> 04:07.674
This looks like a job for...

04:07.708 --> 04:09.709
fireplace tongs.

04:12.713 --> 04:13.846
No!

04:19.553 --> 04:20.519
Oh, my God!

04:20.553 --> 04:22.188
He's in the walls!

04:22.222 --> 04:24.357
I hear chewing.

04:24.391 --> 04:26.959
No, that's a much bigger animal.

04:28.162 --> 04:29.362
Kettle corn.

04:29.396 --> 04:32.398
The heroin
of the farmers' market.

04:32.433 --> 04:34.133
I've lost my guinea pig!

04:42.409 --> 04:44.243
Pokey!

04:44.278 --> 04:47.447
Our boat painting!

04:47.481 --> 04:49.248
I'm sorry, Mom.

04:50.250 --> 04:51.884
That's okay, sweetheart.

04:51.919 --> 04:53.920
Your pig thingy
didn't mean it.

04:53.954 --> 04:56.289
It's just, it felt
comforting to know

04:56.323 --> 04:57.890
that while we watched TV,

04:57.925 --> 05:00.560
there was art
going on behind us.

05:01.995 --> 05:04.030
Oh, well, I guess we have to go

05:04.064 --> 05:06.365
to an art gallery
and buy a new painting.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.568
Sure, we could go
to a fancy gallery

05:08.602 --> 05:11.237
and spend a bunch
of money, or...

05:11.271 --> 05:13.858
Mm... hmm, hmm,
hmm, hmm?

05:13.859 --> 05:15.860
Yeah, Milhouse played
the violin for years

05:15.943 --> 05:17.577
until it turned out
the vibrations

05:17.611 --> 05:19.445
were screwing up his bones.

05:19.480 --> 05:22.048
Yeah, these seem great.

05:22.082 --> 05:25.918
Oh, too bad someone
used cello rosin.

05:32.092 --> 05:35.161
Oh, my gosh, that's beautiful!

05:35.195 --> 05:38.264
I've never seen a painting
with a lighthouse before.

05:38.298 --> 05:39.866
Oh, that.

05:39.900 --> 05:42.068
That was on the wall
of Kirk's bachelor pad,

05:42.102 --> 05:43.903
back when we were

05:43.937 --> 05:45.304
separated.

05:45.339 --> 05:46.906
Yeah, it's a great piece.

05:46.940 --> 05:48.207
I didn't have a mirror,

05:48.242 --> 05:49.442
so I shaved in the reflection

05:49.476 --> 05:51.077
of the chrome frame.

05:51.111 --> 05:53.179
This could be
our new living room painting.

05:53.213 --> 05:54.847
I don't know.

05:54.882 --> 05:55.848
How about this poster

05:55.883 --> 05:57.483
of a really rocking jukebox?

05:57.518 --> 05:59.485
You know it's rocking
'cause music notes

05:59.520 --> 06:00.820
are coming out of it.

06:00.854 --> 06:02.555
Painting's only 20 bucks.

06:02.589 --> 06:05.024
Oh, please, Homie?

06:05.058 --> 06:07.226
I'll throw in
the tiny violins.

06:13.300 --> 06:16.869
Oh, it looks great!

06:16.904 --> 06:18.104
Well...

06:18.138 --> 06:21.507
to me, it looks like...
garbage salad.

06:21.542 --> 06:23.543
But that's
the great thing about art.

06:23.577 --> 06:27.380
Everyone can have their own
opinion about why it sucks.

06:27.414 --> 06:29.549
I've got to get rid
of this ugly chrome frame

06:29.583 --> 06:31.517
from Kirk's bachelor bad.

06:31.552 --> 06:34.520
I hate to think of the things
this mirror has reflected.

06:35.789 --> 06:36.956
Hmm!

06:36.990 --> 06:38.457
Hey, look.

06:38.492 --> 06:41.093
There's a signature
that the frame covered up.

06:41.128 --> 06:44.263
"Johan Oldenveldt."

06:44.298 --> 06:46.265
Here he is!

06:46.300 --> 06:48.901
"Johan Oldenveldt, painter.

06:48.936 --> 06:50.369
"Lived in Amsterdam, Paris.

06:50.404 --> 06:53.272
Prolific early 20th century
naturalist."

06:53.307 --> 06:55.575
Ooh, I think this was painted
by someone famous.

06:55.609 --> 06:57.276
Maybe it's valuable.

06:57.311 --> 06:59.579
We should
have it appraised.

06:59.613 --> 07:01.280
Pfft!
You guys are crazy.

07:01.315 --> 07:02.849
I never even
heard of that guy.

07:02.883 --> 07:04.050
It's not like
it was painted

07:04.084 --> 07:06.419
by Leonardo Da Vinci Code.

07:06.453 --> 07:08.955
Now, here's what
makes art valuable--

07:08.989 --> 07:11.524
One: nudity,
two: holograms,

07:11.558 --> 07:14.160
three: something terrible
happening to Jesus.

07:16.997 --> 07:19.165
Ah yes, seascape,

07:19.199 --> 07:20.833
marvelous natural light,

07:20.868 --> 07:23.736
classic use of gouache.

07:23.770 --> 07:24.937
You're right.

07:24.972 --> 07:27.240
This is an early-career
Oldenveldt.

07:27.274 --> 07:28.941
Quite valuable.

07:28.976 --> 07:30.443
Oh, my God!

07:30.477 --> 07:31.978
I expect it to go somewhere

07:32.012 --> 07:34.747
between 80 to $100,000.

07:34.781 --> 07:36.082
Nobody touch it!

07:36.116 --> 07:37.416
Bart, stop looking at it!

07:37.451 --> 07:38.651
But I want to see it!

07:38.685 --> 07:40.486
No, you'll wear it out!

07:40.520 --> 07:43.556
Baby, you saw something in this
painting, and you were right.

07:43.590 --> 07:46.392
Wow, the Van Houtens
owned this for years,

07:46.426 --> 07:49.028
and never knew
how much it was worth.

07:49.062 --> 07:50.529
Think how happy they'll be

07:50.564 --> 07:53.232
when we sell it and split
the money with them.

07:53.267 --> 07:55.067
Split it? Whoa!

07:55.102 --> 07:56.702
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

07:56.737 --> 07:59.639
whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

07:59.673 --> 08:01.974
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa...

08:02.009 --> 08:03.276
whoa!

08:04.745 --> 08:07.413
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:07.447 --> 08:09.582
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:09.616 --> 08:11.484
Oh!

08:15.647 --> 08:18.527
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:18.943 --> 08:20.711
Split it with them?

08:20.745 --> 08:22.646
Kirk and Luann didn't
know what the painting

08:22.680 --> 08:24.381
was worth when they sold it.

08:24.415 --> 08:26.783
Yes, they sold it to us.

08:26.818 --> 08:29.319
So, now it's our painting.

08:29.354 --> 08:30.954
We can hang it on our wall,

08:30.989 --> 08:32.990
cut eyeholes in it
to spy on people.

08:33.024 --> 08:35.558
Or sell it for lots of money

08:35.592 --> 08:37.394
which we keep.

08:37.428 --> 08:38.861
For ourselves?

08:38.897 --> 08:40.931
This dude gets it.

08:42.433 --> 08:45.035
But the Van Houtens
are our friends.

08:45.069 --> 08:46.436
Are they, Marge?

08:46.471 --> 08:47.638
If you think about it,

08:47.672 --> 08:48.939
aren't they really
just the parents

08:48.973 --> 08:51.508
of a kid who happens
to hang out with our kid?

08:51.542 --> 08:53.877
All our friends
are like that.

08:53.912 --> 08:56.380
Well, how would you feel
if we sold them something

08:56.414 --> 08:58.615
that turned out
to be valuable?

08:58.650 --> 09:00.918
I would feel A) Happy
for their good fortune,

09:00.952 --> 09:02.586
B) Proud to know rich people,

09:02.620 --> 09:04.655
and C) Grateful
for an opportunity

09:04.689 --> 09:06.690
to learn from a mistake.

09:06.724 --> 09:08.425
<i>How about this?</i>

09:08.459 --> 09:10.527
What if we give
the Van Houtens

09:10.561 --> 09:12.529
25% of the money?

09:12.563 --> 09:13.764
Then they'll just be mad

09:13.798 --> 09:17.000
about the 65%
that we're keeping.

09:17.035 --> 09:19.703
Marge, you like
kindness, right?

09:19.737 --> 09:20.837
Sure.

09:20.872 --> 09:22.506
So, even if we gave

09:22.540 --> 09:24.741
Kirk and Luann
some of the money,

09:24.776 --> 09:28.712
the knowledge of what they could
have had will eat away at them,

09:28.746 --> 09:31.982
like piranhas devouring
a wounded yeti.

09:32.016 --> 09:35.152
It's kinder never to tell them.

09:35.186 --> 09:36.920
Okay, I see your point.

09:36.955 --> 09:39.156
We should sell the painting,
keep all the money,

09:39.190 --> 09:42.125
and never, ever tell
the Van Houtens.

09:42.160 --> 09:43.493
Mm-hmm!

09:51.069 --> 09:52.736
What'll it take to
buy your silence?

09:52.770 --> 09:53.804
Hmm.

09:53.838 --> 09:55.105
<i>Okay, Milhouse,</i>

09:55.139 --> 09:57.441
the guys in back are shining up
your new bike.

09:57.475 --> 09:59.409
And all I have to do
is not say anything

09:59.444 --> 10:01.878
about some painting
to my Mom and Dad?

10:01.913 --> 10:05.782
Oh, sweetie, you want your
parents to be happy, don't you?

10:05.817 --> 10:07.551
I guess.

10:07.585 --> 10:09.753
"I guess"!

10:09.787 --> 10:11.021
You're funny!

10:11.055 --> 10:13.090
No wonder Lisa's
in love with you.

10:13.124 --> 10:14.291
She is?!

10:14.325 --> 10:15.993
She is?!

10:16.027 --> 10:17.961
So, if I keep my mouth shut,

10:17.996 --> 10:20.097
you get me new
wheelie sneakers,

10:20.131 --> 10:22.099
and Bart agrees
to promote and encourage use

10:22.133 --> 10:24.701
of my new
cool nickname, "C.J."

10:26.971 --> 10:28.205
You got it, Ceej.

10:29.941 --> 10:32.909
You found out that painting
was worth big bucks,

10:32.944 --> 10:34.945
and you weren't
gonna tell us?!

10:34.979 --> 10:37.581
I don't know
what you're talking about.

10:37.615 --> 10:39.049
Hide the treasure!

10:39.083 --> 10:40.517
I'm sorry, Mr. S.

10:40.551 --> 10:41.752
I cracked!

10:41.786 --> 10:43.020
We had a deal.

10:43.054 --> 10:45.489
And now we've got nothing!

10:50.228 --> 10:52.129
We considered you
our friends.

10:52.163 --> 10:53.530
We trusted you!

10:53.564 --> 10:55.732
I let Homer use
our master bathroom!

10:55.767 --> 10:57.667
Then you stab us
in the back!

10:59.237 --> 11:02.172
If you knew you sold
a valuable painting for nothing,

11:02.206 --> 11:04.207
how could you live
with yourselves?

11:04.242 --> 11:07.177
We were just trying
to be... kind.

11:07.211 --> 11:10.013
Kind?! You call it kind
to give us nothing?

11:10.048 --> 11:11.581
We were gonna treat you

11:11.616 --> 11:13.116
to dinner
at an upscale chain restaurant

11:13.151 --> 11:15.652
and never explain why,
but now forget it!

11:15.686 --> 11:17.154
Oh, so that's how it is!

11:17.188 --> 11:19.189
That's exactly
how it is.

11:19.223 --> 11:20.590
Oh, is it?!

11:20.625 --> 11:22.526
Oh, it is!

11:22.560 --> 11:25.729
Luann, I hope
we're still on Thursday

11:25.763 --> 11:28.465
for collecting used
cell phones for the troops.

11:28.499 --> 11:30.167
I don't think
you need any help.

11:30.201 --> 11:32.602
You're so good at...
collecting.

11:33.738 --> 11:35.005
Oh!

11:35.039 --> 11:38.875
Oh, that was cold,
Luann!

11:38.910 --> 11:40.610
So cold!

11:40.645 --> 11:42.646
Brr!

11:42.680 --> 11:45.115
Sarcastic brr!

11:45.149 --> 11:47.784
See what happens
when we get greedy?

11:47.819 --> 11:50.187
Honey, there's something
I want to show you.

11:50.221 --> 11:51.688
An ATM receipt?

11:51.722 --> 11:53.023
I don't know
whose this is.

11:53.057 --> 11:54.958
I found it next
to the cash machine,

11:54.992 --> 11:57.127
and I've always kept it.
Look at the balance.

11:57.161 --> 11:59.162
Five figures!

11:59.197 --> 12:02.599
With that painting, we could
have what these people have:

12:02.633 --> 12:04.668
a money cushion.

12:04.702 --> 12:07.137
No more living
paycheck to paycheck,

12:07.171 --> 12:10.073
one lost retainer away
from the gutter.

12:10.108 --> 12:13.143
I could write a check
with today's date on it.

12:13.177 --> 12:15.245
That's the cushion.

12:18.082 --> 12:19.950
Tonight, a special report.

12:19.984 --> 12:21.751
Fat cat art experts
take advantage

12:21.786 --> 12:23.920
of John and Jane Yard Sale.

12:23.955 --> 12:26.056
So, would you characterize
your friend of many years

12:26.090 --> 12:28.625
cheating you out of your
painting as no big deal,

12:28.659 --> 12:30.227
or a devastating betrayal?

12:30.261 --> 12:32.129
Oh, definitely betrayal, Kent.

12:32.163 --> 12:33.663
Interesting.

12:33.698 --> 12:36.166
So if you see the Simpsons
walking down your street,

12:36.200 --> 12:39.136
lock your doors and hide...
your friendship.

12:39.170 --> 12:40.704
Great! Now we're raccoons,

12:40.738 --> 12:43.140
the masked bandits
of the animal world!

12:43.174 --> 12:46.710
Don't worry. No one's gonna see
this stupid show.

12:51.249 --> 12:53.884
The whole town's
turned against us!

12:59.857 --> 13:01.958
Ooh, a support rock!

13:01.993 --> 13:04.794
This one's against us.
This one's for us.

13:04.829 --> 13:07.898
For, for, against,
for, against...

13:07.932 --> 13:10.600
We don't even get this many
Christmas cards.

13:14.839 --> 13:18.441
There they are,
the Masterpiece Thievers!

13:18.476 --> 13:19.943
Ah, shut your bone hole!

13:19.977 --> 13:21.945
That painting belongs
to the Simpsons!

13:21.979 --> 13:24.714
Sharing is what makes
a community strong!

13:24.749 --> 13:26.249
All sales are final!

13:26.284 --> 13:27.384
Keep it!

13:27.418 --> 13:28.652
Finders keepers, moron!

13:28.686 --> 13:31.488
You really think we're still
doing the right thing?

13:31.522 --> 13:35.492
Just close your eyes
and think of the cushion.

13:38.262 --> 13:42.566
"Untitled Landscape"
by Johan Oldenveldt,

13:42.600 --> 13:45.335
from the Collection of Homer J.
and Marge B. Simpson.

13:45.369 --> 13:48.205
Let's open the bidding
at $80,000.

13:50.374 --> 13:53.109
The paddles, Marge!
Look at the paddles!

13:57.081 --> 13:59.082
Stop the auction!

13:59.116 --> 14:01.785
That painting belongs to me!

14:01.819 --> 14:03.053
Dawn?

14:03.087 --> 14:06.189
Good to see you again,
Beef Kirky.

14:06.224 --> 14:07.791
Who is this woman?

14:07.825 --> 14:12.862
Uhhhhhh...

14:12.897 --> 14:14.064
While you two
were separated,

14:14.098 --> 14:16.466
Kirk and used
to be friends...

14:16.500 --> 14:18.435
with banana-fits.

14:19.470 --> 14:21.204
You told me
you didn't see anyone

14:21.239 --> 14:22.706
during our separation.

14:22.740 --> 14:28.078
Uhhhhhh...

14:28.112 --> 14:31.815
Madam, are you saying
this painting belongs to you?

14:31.849 --> 14:33.416
Kirk stole it from me!

14:33.451 --> 14:35.185
But I didn't know
it was valuable

14:35.219 --> 14:37.220
till I saw the story on TV.

14:37.255 --> 14:39.055
What?! I bought
that painting!

14:39.090 --> 14:40.390
She's lying!

14:40.424 --> 14:42.325
The auction is on hold

14:42.360 --> 14:45.095
until we can determine
the true ownership.

14:46.697 --> 14:47.964
Our cushion!

14:47.999 --> 14:50.634
Don't bother
coming home, Kirk!

14:50.668 --> 14:51.835
Aw!

14:51.869 --> 14:53.003
See what your
greed has done?

14:53.037 --> 14:54.004
Ow!

14:54.038 --> 14:56.339
Anybody want
to give me a ride home?

14:56.374 --> 14:57.741
Going once?

14:57.775 --> 14:58.942
Going twice?

14:58.976 --> 15:01.144
Sold! To the lonely auctioneer!

15:02.146 --> 15:03.346
Ah!

15:10.187 --> 15:12.154
Thanks for
taking me in, man.

15:12.189 --> 15:15.324
I guess I can't help but feel
fully responsible.

15:15.359 --> 15:19.128
Oh, Luann, I'll never gaze
from my thick eyeglasses

15:19.162 --> 15:21.964
into your thick eyeglasses
ever again.

15:21.999 --> 15:24.834
What you need, my friend,
is a Canadian Duff.

15:24.868 --> 15:26.502
Beauty, eh?

15:26.536 --> 15:30.506
So... why <i>does</i> that chick think
she owns the painting?

15:30.540 --> 15:32.675
Oh, Dawn and I went
on a vacation

15:32.709 --> 15:35.645
to a resort island
called Isla Verde.

15:35.679 --> 15:37.279
I bought the painting
in a café,

15:37.314 --> 15:41.183
but that night she ran off
with a parasailing instructor.

15:41.218 --> 15:42.885
Not your fault, man.

15:42.919 --> 15:46.122
Those parasailing guys take
whatever they want.

15:46.156 --> 15:47.356
It was never her painting.

15:47.391 --> 15:49.291
That woman will
say anything

15:49.326 --> 15:51.827
to keep herself in
electric cigarettes.

15:51.862 --> 15:54.463
And I'd go back to that
Café Artiste to prove it,

15:54.498 --> 15:57.867
but nothing's gonna
get me Luann back.

16:02.172 --> 16:05.141
Okay, all I gotta do is take
a quick ferry to Isla Verde,

16:05.175 --> 16:08.778
find Café Artiste,
and they'll back up Kirk's story.

16:08.812 --> 16:12.081
That will prove the painting
was his-- and now ours.

16:12.115 --> 16:15.951
Oh, Homer Simpson, that painting
has torn the town apart,

16:15.986 --> 16:18.054
destroyed Kirk
and Luann's marriage,

16:18.088 --> 16:21.357
and everyone's very worried
about Milhouse.

16:21.391 --> 16:23.392
He's been playing
Dancing Revolution for hours,

16:23.427 --> 16:25.227
but the TV is off.

16:29.199 --> 16:30.766
But our cushion!

16:30.801 --> 16:33.335
That picture has brought out
the worst in everyone!

16:33.370 --> 16:37.540
Please! Just let it go!

16:40.077 --> 16:42.078
You're not gonna
let it go, are you?

16:42.112 --> 16:43.979
I wish I knew how.

16:46.116 --> 16:48.084
This is so exciting!

16:48.118 --> 16:50.219
My first time
establishing provenance!

16:50.253 --> 16:51.787
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just remember,

16:51.822 --> 16:55.891
if your mother asks,
I took you to a wine tasting.

16:55.926 --> 16:58.294
That's a terrible thing
for a father to do.

16:58.328 --> 17:00.096
That's why
she'll believe it.

17:01.865 --> 17:04.200
Hmm, this quaint artist
community

17:04.233 --> 17:05.835
has gotten a little touristy.

17:11.441 --> 17:14.777
Excuse me. We're trying
to find Café Artiste.

17:14.810 --> 17:16.712
Ah, yes.
Top of the hill.

17:16.747 --> 17:18.414
Three discos up, four
gelatos on the left.

17:18.448 --> 17:20.148
You can't miss it.

17:20.183 --> 17:22.651
It's right between the disco
and the gelato place.

17:22.685 --> 17:23.986
Mmm. Hmm.

17:24.020 --> 17:26.255
Mm-mm!

17:26.289 --> 17:27.990
Mm...

17:28.023 --> 17:29.258
Welcome to Café Artiste!

17:29.292 --> 17:31.727
Would you like
a glass of Strupo?

17:31.762 --> 17:33.763
It's a liqueur made
of fermented capers,

17:33.797 --> 17:35.698
the official drink
of the island.

17:35.732 --> 17:37.733
Mmm! Sounds delicious.

17:37.768 --> 17:39.235
It's not.

17:39.269 --> 17:42.905
Hey, a friend of mine,
uh, bought a painting here.

17:42.939 --> 17:45.040
Oh, yes, I remember
that painting.

17:45.075 --> 17:47.143
And that is the man
I sold it to.

17:47.177 --> 17:49.979
And that man sold it to me!

17:50.013 --> 17:51.714
That proves the
painting is mine!

17:51.748 --> 17:53.949
And nothing can stop
me from selling it

17:53.984 --> 17:56.385
and keeping all the money!

17:56.419 --> 17:58.120
I love art!

17:58.155 --> 17:59.355
Art?

17:59.389 --> 18:01.357
What do you know about art?

18:01.391 --> 18:03.726
You don't even know
who painted that picture.

18:03.760 --> 18:06.462
Yes, I do.
It's a Johan Oldenveldt.

18:06.496 --> 18:08.864
Wrong! It's a me!

18:08.899 --> 18:10.633
A what?
I painted it!

18:10.667 --> 18:12.201
Me, Klaus Ziegler!

18:12.235 --> 18:13.435
Who?

18:14.938 --> 18:17.306
Mm!
Oh!

18:17.340 --> 18:19.975
This is where I painted
your so-called Oldenveldt.

18:20.010 --> 18:20.910
Prove it.

18:23.313 --> 18:24.780
Aw, crap!

18:24.815 --> 18:26.248
You're a forger?

18:26.283 --> 18:29.185
"Forger" is such
a cruel word.

18:29.219 --> 18:30.986
I'm an art forger.

18:31.021 --> 18:33.489
Your painting was
an early, clumsy effort

18:33.523 --> 18:36.992
which I gave to the café owner
to pay off my Strupo tab.

18:38.895 --> 18:40.362
Whew!

18:40.397 --> 18:42.865
Then why did the auction house
say it was real?

18:42.899 --> 18:45.201
I have fooled galleries
around the world

18:45.235 --> 18:47.269
with my loving imitations.

18:47.304 --> 18:50.039
Ziegler! Ziegler! Ziegler!

18:50.073 --> 18:53.275
Ziegler!
Ziegler! Ziegler!

18:53.310 --> 18:55.211
What you do is horrible...

18:55.245 --> 18:57.413
ripping off geniuses
who spent years

18:57.447 --> 18:59.348
perfecting their styles.

18:59.382 --> 19:01.483
Perhaps you are the one
who is horrible.

19:01.518 --> 19:02.184
What?!

19:02.219 --> 19:03.886
You only cared about that

19:03.920 --> 19:04.987
painting when you thought

19:05.021 --> 19:07.022
it was created
by someone famous.

19:07.057 --> 19:12.828
Well, no, but <i>now</i> when I look
at it, all I see is a fraud.

19:12.863 --> 19:14.563
Beauty is beauty.

19:14.598 --> 19:18.400
My forgeries give pleasure to people
all over the world.

19:18.435 --> 19:21.370
<i>The only real question</i>
<i>to ask about art,</i>

19:21.404 --> 19:22.671
<i>whether it's in the Louvre</i>

19:22.706 --> 19:25.674
<i>or on a freshman's wall</i>
<i>at Cal State Fullerton</i>

19:25.709 --> 19:28.544
is, "Did it move you?"

19:28.578 --> 19:30.279
But, you still, I mean...

19:30.313 --> 19:33.349
Oh, I suppose you're right.

19:33.383 --> 19:34.984
What if I never liked
the painting

19:35.018 --> 19:36.352
and only wanted it for money?

19:36.386 --> 19:38.087
Then you, I respect.

19:39.389 --> 19:41.323
Oh, great.
The painting is worthless,

19:41.358 --> 19:43.025
this was all for nothing,

19:43.059 --> 19:45.694
and when Marge finds out,
she's gonna kill me.

19:45.729 --> 19:49.298
Well, on that front,
perhaps I can be of assistance.

19:49.332 --> 19:51.333
If there's one thing
art is good for,

19:51.368 --> 19:55.571
it's to melt the frost which
often hardens a woman's heart.

19:55.605 --> 19:57.273
While you're at it...

19:57.307 --> 19:59.408
could you make me
a couple more?

19:59.442 --> 20:01.443
I'll pay you in Strupo.

20:13.256 --> 20:14.657
Perfect.

20:14.691 --> 20:16.859
Oh, now that's art.

20:16.893 --> 20:19.194
Rocking.
