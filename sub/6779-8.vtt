WEBVTT

00:05.330 --> 00:08.197
( theme music playing )

01:53.280 --> 01:54.872
- ( phone ringing )
- ( dog barking )

01:57.080 --> 01:58.308
HEY, MARITA.

01:58.410 --> 02:00.071
NO, I'M WORKING.
( chuckles )

02:00.180 --> 02:03.445
ANOTHER HALF HOUR
AND I GOTI'A GO FEED
A CAT OFF MULHOLLAND.

02:04.890 --> 02:06.448
WHAT KIND OF PARTY?

02:06.560 --> 02:09.188
ALL RIGHT, I'LL CALL YOU
WHEN I GET HOME.

02:11.160 --> 02:12.627
OH, SHIT.

02:12.730 --> 02:14.857
YOU SHOULD SEE
THIS HILL.

02:14.960 --> 02:17.690
NO, I'M ON MY
ROLLERBLADES.

02:17.800 --> 02:20.598
I SHOULD REALLY
TAKE THEM OFF
AND WALK DOWN.

02:20.700 --> 02:22.600
IT'S REALLY STEEP.

02:22.710 --> 02:26.237
REALLY, REALLY STEEP.

02:26.340 --> 02:28.535
CALL YOU RIGHT BACK.

02:30.180 --> 02:31.442
( chuckles )

02:31.550 --> 02:33.609
COME ON, PUP,
COME ON!

02:33.720 --> 02:34.971
WHOO!

02:35.080 --> 02:37.048
ALL RIGHT!

02:37.150 --> 02:39.516
( panting )

02:42.330 --> 02:43.456
OH MY GOD!
NOW WE'RE SAFE.

02:43.560 --> 02:46.893
( grunts )

02:47.000 --> 02:48.922
( panting, whining )

02:51.070 --> 02:52.059
( car door opens,
closes )

02:52.170 --> 02:53.637
( barking )

02:53.740 --> 02:55.594
( man yelling )
I NEED SOME HELP
OUT HERE!

02:57.810 --> 02:58.538
I NEED SOME HELP!

03:06.110 --> 03:07.509
DID I TELL YOU
NATE'S DRAGGING ME

03:07.620 --> 03:09.986
TO A QUAKER CHURCH
SERVICE TONIGHT?

03:10.090 --> 03:11.717
- NO. HUH!
- YEAH.

03:11.820 --> 03:14.209
HE THINKS
COUPLES THERAPY IS
A WASTE OF TIME,

03:14.320 --> 03:16.629
SO THIS IS
HIS SOLUTION.

03:16.730 --> 03:19.028
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
ALREADY GOING TO THERAPY.

03:19.130 --> 03:20.950
OH YEAH,
WE WENT ONCE,

03:21.060 --> 03:23.494
BUT HE THOUGHT

03:23.600 --> 03:26.023
THAT THE THERAPIST AND I
WERE GANGING UP ON HIM,

03:26.130 --> 03:27.893
SO THAT WAS THAT.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.707
WELL, WHO KNOWS,
MAYBE A LITTLE SPIRITUALITY
WILL HELP, YOU KNOW.

03:30.810 --> 03:32.232
QUAKERISM?

03:32.340 --> 03:34.103
YEAH, RIGHT.

03:34.210 --> 03:37.600
I JUST WISH HE'D TAKE
HALF AS MUCH INTEREST
IN HIS OWN BABY.

03:37.710 --> 03:39.940
HEY, IF IT WAS
IMPORTANT TO YOU
TO HAVE HIM HERE,

03:40.050 --> 03:41.745
YOU SHOULD HAVE MADE
THAT CLEAR TO HIM.

03:41.850 --> 03:43.738
I DIDN'T TELL HIM.

03:43.850 --> 03:46.978
NATE AND I,
WE'RE 100 MILES APART
ON THIS BABY.

03:47.090 --> 03:48.387
ON EVERYTHING, REALLY.

03:48.490 --> 03:50.879
I DIDN'T WANT HIM HERE.

03:50.990 --> 03:53.049
I MEAN, IT'S NOT
GOOD FOR ME.

03:53.160 --> 03:55.549
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT GOOD
FOR THE BABY.

03:55.660 --> 03:57.969
HUH.

03:58.070 --> 03:59.890
- THANKS FOR COMING.
- YEAH.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.195
- ( knock)
- ( door opens )

04:02.310 --> 04:04.505
- HELLO, BRENDA.
- HEY, DR. MELNICK.

04:04.610 --> 04:06.669
HOW ARE YOU
FEELING TODAY?

04:06.780 --> 04:08.407
OKAY. YEAH.

04:08.510 --> 04:10.603
- WOULD YOU LIE BACK
FOR ME PLEASE?
- MM-HMM.

04:15.020 --> 04:18.012
- NO HUSBAND TODAY?
- NO, NO. HE COULDN'T
GET AWAY FROM WORK.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.712
THIS IS
MY FRIEND JACKIE.

04:34.740 --> 04:36.560
- ( muffled heartbeat)
- THERE'S YOUR FETUS.

04:40.210 --> 04:42.701
OH.

04:42.810 --> 04:44.801
NICE HEARTBEAT.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.844
SIZE LOOKS GOOD.
YEAH.

04:46.950 --> 04:49.942
EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE
DEVELOPING NORMALLY
AT THIS POINT.

04:50.050 --> 04:51.984
SO THE BABY'S HEALTHY?

04:52.090 --> 04:54.217
I'D STILL LIKE
TO DO AN AMNIO.

04:54.320 --> 04:55.514
NO. NO.

04:58.430 --> 05:00.421
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
THE BABY'S SEX?

05:02.400 --> 05:04.925
HERE'S MY WORK NUMBER,
MY CELL NUMBER--

05:05.030 --> 05:06.361
I KNOW THOSE NUMBERS,
DAVID.

05:06.470 --> 05:08.495
YES, BUT SOMETIMES
IN THE PANIC OF AN EMERGENCY

05:08.600 --> 05:10.306
IT'S HELPFUL TO HAVE THEM
WRITTEN DOWN.

05:10.410 --> 05:13.436
I'LL BE DRIVING
ROGER'S LIMO ALL DAY,
SO HERE'S THAT NUMBER.

05:13.540 --> 05:15.371
THIS IS TOO MANY NUMBERS,
HONESTLY.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.675
WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU
WATCHING THE BOYS.

05:17.780 --> 05:19.577
DURRELL DIDN'T TELL US
UNTIL LAST NIGHT THAT

05:19.680 --> 05:22.148
- IT WAS TEACHER
DEVELOPMENT DAY.
- YOU DIDN'T ASK ME.

05:22.250 --> 05:25.378
'M GLAD TO FINALLY HAVE
SOME TIME WITH MY NEW
GRANDCHILDREN.

05:25.490 --> 05:26.957
YOU'VE BEEN
HIDING THEM FROM ME.

05:27.060 --> 05:29.620
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO KEEP
THEM TO A REGULAR SCHEDULE.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.027
WELL, WE'LL
HAVE FUN TODAY.

05:31.130 --> 05:32.950
I BROUGHT THE MAKINGS FOR
CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES.

05:33.060 --> 05:35.995
- I THOUGHT I'D BAKE.
- I LIKE CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES.

05:36.100 --> 05:37.328
ALL BOYS DO.

05:37.430 --> 05:40.137
- I DON'T.
- YOU'LL LIKE MINE.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.764
OH, WE'LL SEE
ABOUT THAT.

05:41.870 --> 05:44.259
DURRELL, YOU DO WHATEVER
MRS. FISHER TELLS YOU TO DO.

05:44.370 --> 05:46.258
WHAT IF SHE TELLS ME
TO JUMP OUT THE WINDOW?

05:46.380 --> 05:49.804
THEY'RE ALLOWED ONE HOUR
OF TELEVISION, ONE HOUR
OF PLAYSTATION

05:49.910 --> 05:52.071
AND THEY CAN TAKE
THEIR SOCCER BALL DOWN
TO THE COURTYARD.

05:52.180 --> 05:54.546
BUT THEY'D BE'I'I'ER
NOT BE KICKING THE BALL
AGAINST THE BUILDING.

05:54.650 --> 05:57.141
- OR YOU'LL WHUP US.
- I DID NOT SAY THAT.

05:57.250 --> 05:59.684
WE'LL BE FINE, REALLY.
YOU TWO GO NOW.

06:03.260 --> 06:05.148
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

06:05.260 --> 06:07.057
David:
I'LL BE HOME BY 5:00.

06:18.140 --> 06:19.835
YOU LOOK
LIKE A WITCH.

06:19.940 --> 06:21.532
I ASSURE YOU I'M NOT.

06:21.640 --> 06:24.609
I DIDN'T SAY YOU WERE.
I SAID YOU LOOK LIKE ONE.

06:27.150 --> 06:29.744
Man on radio:
This is what they made
very efficient.

06:29.850 --> 06:32.887
This is why the Republicans
rely so much on this base.

06:32.990 --> 06:36.528
This is a corporatized
Christian cult situation

06:36.630 --> 06:38.279
where it's about
personal empowerment

06:38.390 --> 06:40.426
which is part of
the Republican agenda--

06:40.530 --> 06:42.293
the neo-contact
cult agenda.

06:42.400 --> 06:43.799
What Ray was talking about--

06:43.900 --> 06:46.789
Ray is obviously
a different type of Christian

06:46.900 --> 06:48.436
who I offended--

06:59.250 --> 07:01.639
( mutters )
OH GOD. JESUS.

07:01.750 --> 07:03.308
OW.

07:03.420 --> 07:05.638
( whistles )

07:08.490 --> 07:10.048
( elevator dings )

07:16.430 --> 07:18.022
( elevator dings )

07:23.010 --> 07:27.674
Usted decidiro sobra
la Seora de Guadalupe.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.998
S. Perro con manguillos
de cobre.

07:30.110 --> 07:31.941
Amarillo pulido.

07:32.050 --> 07:33.039
Qu?

07:33.150 --> 07:34.572
El cobre pulido.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.682
Pulido--
PULIDO WHAT?

07:36.790 --> 07:38.542
Pulido--
qu pulido?

07:38.650 --> 07:41.619
Con en el interior
en seda rosada,
en vez de marrn.

07:41.720 --> 07:43.927
POLISHED.
PULIDO, POLISHED.

07:44.030 --> 07:45.827
POLISHED WHAT?

07:45.930 --> 07:48.023
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

07:48.130 --> 07:50.018
Qu dio.

07:50.130 --> 07:51.995
( sighs )

07:53.140 --> 07:54.198
Por favor,
un momento.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.502
IF YOU KNEW THEY
DIDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH,

07:58.610 --> 08:00.373
THEN WHY DID YOU EVEN TRY
TO HANDLE THE INTAKE?

08:00.480 --> 08:01.731
I'M TRYING
TO LEARN SPANISH.

08:01.840 --> 08:03.444
BY USING OUR CLIENTS
AS A CLASSROOM?

08:03.550 --> 08:05.142
I DIDN'T PLAN THIS.
IT WAS A WALK-IN.

08:05.250 --> 08:06.512
I WAS
THE ONLY ONE AVAILABLE.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.975
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED DO
WITH THIS BODY NOW?

08:09.890 --> 08:11.517
YOU WANNA
TAKE OVER FOR ME?

08:11.620 --> 08:14.555
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU CAN'T.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.821
I ALREADY DID
MOST OF THE WORK.

08:16.930 --> 08:20.149
GREAT. I'M REALLY
IN THE MOOD FOR DEALING
WITH A GRIEVING WIDOWER.

08:20.260 --> 08:21.750
IT'S HER PARENTS.

08:21.860 --> 08:23.828
SHE'S MARRIED,
THEN HER PARENTS
DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT

08:23.930 --> 08:26.467
- TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS.
- I THINK SHE WAS DIVORCED.

08:26.570 --> 08:29.038
- YOU THINK?
- YES, RICO, I THINK.

08:31.810 --> 08:34.574
( speaking Spanish )

08:38.250 --> 08:40.172
- GRACIAS.
- GRACIAS.

08:45.550 --> 08:47.814
UH, ARE YOU REALLY SURE
ABOUT ALL THIS?

08:47.920 --> 08:51.651
- WHAT?
- DIDN'T YOU OVERDO IT
ON THE MERCHANDISE?

08:51.760 --> 08:53.421
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

08:53.530 --> 08:55.953
YOU SOLD THEM
A CASKET FOR $4,000,

08:56.060 --> 08:58.164
YOU ADDED ANOTHER $600
JUST TO SWITCH HANDLES,

08:58.270 --> 09:00.966
THREE GRAND FOR THE MONUMENT,
ANOTHER $400 FOR DOVES.

09:01.070 --> 09:02.662
IT JUST GOES ON.

09:02.770 --> 09:04.761
THIS IS THEIR YOUNGEST
DAUGHTER THERE BURYING.

09:04.870 --> 09:07.202
THE GUY WORKS
IN A MACHINE SHOP.
HE CAN'T AFFORD THIS.

09:07.310 --> 09:09.972
BESIDES LEARNING TO MANGLE
A FEW WORDS IN SPANISH,

09:10.080 --> 09:13.345
MAYBE YOU SHOULD LEARN
SOMETHING ABOUT LATIN
CULTURE AS WELL.

09:13.450 --> 09:15.008
WE HONOR OUR DEAD, NATE.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.884
- AND END UP BROKE
BECAUSE OF IT.
- THAT IS SO RACIST.

09:17.990 --> 09:20.481
HOW AM I BEING RACIST?!
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAID
IT'S CULTURAL.

09:20.590 --> 09:24.378
EVERY SINGLE MEMBER
OF THE FAMILY PITCHES IN
AT MOMENTS LIKE THIS.

09:24.490 --> 09:27.129
EVERYONE.
WE TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER.
NO ONE'S LEFI' BROKE.

09:28.560 --> 09:29.549
I'VE GOT WORK TO DO.

09:31.700 --> 09:33.964
( door opens, closes )

09:34.070 --> 09:37.369
AS YOU CAN SEE WE'VE GOT
A TOP OF THE LINE RETORT

09:37.470 --> 09:39.461
TO THE PRIMARY
AND SECONDARY CHAMBERS--

09:39.570 --> 09:41.504
JUST RE-LINED
LAST YEAR.

09:41.610 --> 09:42.975
FEEL FREE TO LOOK OVER
EVERYTHING.

09:43.080 --> 09:45.275
- YOU'RE ASKING 340,000?
- MM-HMM.

09:45.380 --> 09:46.813
OH, IT'S WORTH
EVERY PENNY, DAVID.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.911
I GET OVER 300 CASES A YEAR.

09:49.020 --> 09:51.386
I COULD HANDLE MORE
IF I ADDED ANOTHER RETORT

09:51.490 --> 09:52.684
WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHAT I WOULD DO

09:52.790 --> 09:54.678
IF I WERE 20 YEARS
YOUNGER.

09:54.790 --> 09:57.850
- CREMATION IS A GROWING
BUSINESS, YOU KNOW THAT.
- YES, I DO.

09:57.960 --> 10:00.326
YOU DON'T WANT FISHER & SONS
TO GET LEFT BEHIND.

10:00.430 --> 10:02.352
UH, FISHER & DIAZ.

10:02.460 --> 10:04.121
PFFI'.

10:04.230 --> 10:07.529
I'VE GOT ANOTHER
PROSPECTIVE BUYER STOPPING BY
IN THE MORNING.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.835
- I SEE.
- I'M NOT TRYING
TO PUSH YOU,

10:09.940 --> 10:13.307
BUT I'VE HAD THIS PLACE
SINCE 1972.

10:13.410 --> 10:15.037
IT'S BEEN GOOD TO ME.

10:15.140 --> 10:18.871
I'D BE PLEASED
TO PASS IT ON TO THE SONS
OF NATHANIEL FISHER.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.272
I'LL TALK
TO MY PARTNERS.

10:22.380 --> 10:24.712
REGULAR NON-FAT LATI'E.

10:24.820 --> 10:27.459
OH! STEAL US
A BUNCH OF SPLENDAS.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.949
- LIKE A WHOLE BUNCH.
- SPLENDA.

10:30.060 --> 10:32.858
YEAH. A LARGE MOCHA
ICE-BLENDED PLEASE.

10:34.530 --> 10:39.229
I WANT A REGULAR SOY
POMEGRANATE BLUEBERRY
TEA LATI'E

10:39.330 --> 10:44.108
BUT IN A LARGE CUP
AND THEN COULD YOU JUST
FILL UP THE REST WITH SOY?

10:44.210 --> 10:48.032
ISN'T THAT JUST
A LARGE SOY POMEGRANATE
BLUEBERRY TEA LA'ITE?

10:48.140 --> 10:50.870
NO, IT'S A REGULAR
IN A LARGE CUP.

10:52.410 --> 10:54.275
OH, AND ALSO...

10:54.380 --> 10:56.177
A REDUCED-FAT...

10:56.280 --> 10:57.713
WHOLESOME MORNING MUFFIN.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.020
CLAIRE?

11:10.130 --> 11:11.722
HEY, ANITA.

11:11.830 --> 11:14.936
WELL, SOMEONE'S
VERY THIRSTY.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.962
- OH.
- AND ON HER WAY
TO BIBLE CLASS, I'M GUESSING.

11:17.070 --> 11:19.561
OH YEAH.
IT'S PRE'ITY AWFUL,
ISN'T IT?

11:19.670 --> 11:22.377
I'M KIND OF TEMPING
AT THIS PLACE.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.004
OH, IS THAT WHERE
YOU'VE BEEN?

11:24.110 --> 11:26.476
SHIT, I'VE LEFI' YOU
LIKE 100 MESSAGES.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD.

11:26.580 --> 11:28.070
( sighs )
SORRY.

11:28.180 --> 11:31.684
YOU WERE LIKE MY BEST FRIEND
AND THEN SUDDENLY
YOU WERE GONE.

11:31.790 --> 11:34.418
( sighs )
WELL, HOW'VE YOU BEEN?

11:34.520 --> 11:36.408
FABULOUS.
YOU KNOW--

11:36.520 --> 11:38.556
SCHOOL, SEX, DRUGS,
CREATING ART.

11:38.660 --> 11:41.652
- WELL, THAT'S GOOD.
- YEAH.

11:41.760 --> 11:44.228
I'M KIND OF ON THE CLOCK,
SO I SHOULD PROBABLY GO.

11:44.330 --> 11:46.730
ALL RIGHT. AH, HERE,
LET ME GIVE YOU THIS.

11:48.600 --> 11:49.908
LAC-ARTS JUNIOR SHOW.

11:50.010 --> 11:53.070
- I GOT A PIECE IN IT.
- OH, WOW.

11:53.180 --> 11:54.909
PLEASE PROMISE
YOU'LL COME.

11:55.010 --> 11:56.477
EVERYBODY'LL BE THERE.

11:58.480 --> 12:00.277
YEAH, OKAY.
GREAT.

12:00.380 --> 12:02.268
GOOD.

12:02.380 --> 12:05.679
Ruth:
BOYS, THE FIRST BATCH
IS READY!

12:05.790 --> 12:08.588
ANTHONY,
DU RRELL,

12:08.690 --> 12:10.055
THE COOKIES ARE READY!

12:22.470 --> 12:26.338
( hip-hop music blasting )

12:26.440 --> 12:28.931
( Durrell rapping )

12:29.980 --> 12:31.971
( tires squealing )

12:46.760 --> 12:48.796
I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU DOING THIS FOR ME.

12:50.170 --> 12:51.899
SURE.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.230
COME ON, A QUAKER
CHURCH SERVICE.

12:54.340 --> 12:56.137
AT THE VERY LEAST
IT'LL BE INTERESTING.

12:56.240 --> 12:58.731
I'M TRYING TO KEEP
AN OPEN MIND.

12:58.840 --> 13:01.104
THERE'S NO SERMON
OR ANYTHING.

13:02.110 --> 13:03.338
PEOPLE JUST SIT SILENTLY

13:03.450 --> 13:05.975
AND WAIT TO BE FILLED
WITH THE PRESENCE OF GOD.

13:08.520 --> 13:11.011
MAGGIE SAYS WE CAN
SAY SOMETHING IF WE
FEEL LIKE IT,

13:11.120 --> 13:13.884
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
IT'S NOT LIKE A REQUIREMENT.

13:13.990 --> 13:16.857
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
MAGGIE THINKS WE SHOULD KNOW?

13:20.230 --> 13:22.698
MELNICK SAYS THE BABY'S
LOOKING REALLY GOOD.

13:22.800 --> 13:25.291
- WHEN WAS THIS?
- THIS MORNING.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.038
I HAD A SONOGRAM.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.869
WHAT? WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME ABOUT IT?

13:28.970 --> 13:30.699
BECAUSE I WANTED
TO SPARE YOU THE GRIEF.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.278
I'M SORRY, BUT THIS
IS ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT.

13:33.380 --> 13:36.076
IT PISSES ME OFF
WHEN YOU DO STUFF LIKE
THIS WITHOUT TELLING ME.

13:36.180 --> 13:38.273
SO WHY DON'T YOU SIT THERE
AND ALLOW YOURSELF

13:38.380 --> 13:40.371
TO BE FILLED
WITH THE PRESENCE OF GOD?

13:44.920 --> 13:48.788
- SO WHAT DID SHE SAY?
- SHE SAID THAT THE BABY
WAS DEVELOPING NORMALLY.

13:48.890 --> 13:51.950
THERE'S NO SIGN
OF ANY IRREGULARITIES,

13:52.060 --> 13:54.722
ALL OF WHICH IS VERY
VERY ENCOURAGING.

13:54.830 --> 13:56.821
SO IT'S PERFECT LY HEALTHY.

13:56.930 --> 13:59.069
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THERE ARE SOME THINGS

13:59.170 --> 14:01.058
THAT THE SONOGRAM
CAN'T TELL.

14:02.370 --> 14:05.168
WHAT, SO IT COULD HAVE
DOWN'S OR SPINA BIFIDA?

14:05.270 --> 14:08.535
PROBABLY NOT DOWNS
BECAUSE WE DID THIS
NECK MEASUREMENT TEST

14:08.640 --> 14:10.870
AND THAT LOOKED
REALLY GOOD.

14:10.980 --> 14:13.972
WOW.
SO, GREAT!

14:14.080 --> 14:16.446
WE GET TO MAYBE CHECK
THIS ONE THING OFF THE LIST

14:16.550 --> 14:18.780
AND IT COULD STILL HAVE
A MILLION OTHER THINGS
WRONG WITH IT.

14:18.890 --> 14:21.358
THE BABY'S NOT AN IT,
NATE, IT'S A GIRL.

14:23.690 --> 14:25.282
WE'RE HAVING
ANOTHER DAUGHTER.

14:27.930 --> 14:28.919
( exhales )

14:32.300 --> 14:34.461
MOM, HOW COULD YOU LET THEM
TAKE OFF LIKE THAT?

14:34.570 --> 14:35.969
I HAD NO IDEA
THEY'D LEFI'.

14:36.070 --> 14:37.628
WHY WEREN'T YOU
WATCHING THEM?

14:37.740 --> 14:40.675
I WAS MAKING COOKIES.
YOU SAID THEY COULD PLAY
IN THE COURTYARD.

14:40.780 --> 14:42.771
YOU NEVER THOUGHT ONCE
CHECK ON THEM?

14:42.880 --> 14:45.098
DON'T TALK TO ME
LIKE I'M AN IMBECILE.

14:45.210 --> 14:46.939
- I'VE RSED THREE CHILDREN.
- THAT'S WHY I EXPECTED

14:47.050 --> 14:48.847
A LITTLE MORE FROM YOU.
THIS JUST CAN'T HAPPEN.

14:48.950 --> 14:51.612
THEN YOU CAN TAKE ME OFF
YOUR LIST OF BABYSITTERS.

14:52.790 --> 14:54.257
I'M TAKING MY COOKIES.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.922
YOU CAN WIPE THAT SMIRK
RIGHT OFF YOUR FACE.

15:03.030 --> 15:06.067
YOU ARE GROUNDED, MISTER.

15:06.170 --> 15:08.491
AND YOU CANNOT TELL
KEITH ABOUT THIS.

15:16.110 --> 15:18.977
Nate: YOU CAN'T JUST
SHUFFLE THROUGH THE PROCESS
AND PRETEND I DON'T EXIST.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.548
IT'S NERVE-WRACKING ENOUGH
FOR ME WITHOUT YOU BEING--

15:21.650 --> 15:23.015
WHAT,
THE VOICE OF REASON?

15:50.980 --> 15:53.119
( man speaking on TV)

15:53.220 --> 15:56.747
WOW, YOU LOOK GREAT.

15:56.850 --> 15:58.283
ARE WE GOING OUT
TONIGHT?

15:58.390 --> 16:00.881
I AM. I'M GOING
TO DINNER WITH ANGELICA

16:00.990 --> 16:02.252
AND SOME
OF HER FRIENDS.

16:02.360 --> 16:04.487
WE MIGHT GO TO A PARTY
AFTERWARDS SO DON'T WAIT UP.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.292
OH.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.766
BOYS EATEN?

16:11.870 --> 16:13.360
THIS IS WEDNESDAY.

16:13.470 --> 16:15.392
IT'S YOUR NIGHT
TO TAKE CARE OF DINNER.

16:17.610 --> 16:19.931
- OH, RIGHT RIGHT.
- DON'T GIVE ME THAT LOOK.

16:20.040 --> 16:21.507
YOU HAVE ONE NIGHT
A WEEK, I HAVE SIX.

16:21.610 --> 16:23.669
ORDER SOME PIZZA
IF THAT'S THE BEST
YOU CAN DO.

16:23.780 --> 16:27.568
- I CAN COOK SOMETHING.
- DON'T FORGET TO CLEAN UP.
THAT'S NOT MY JOB.

16:27.680 --> 16:31.309
- OKAY, I GET IT.
- AND DO NOT MAKE ME
THE BAD GUY HERE, PLEASE?

16:31.420 --> 16:32.910
VANESSA...

16:35.760 --> 16:37.079
IAM.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.627
- ( door closes )
- Man: SO, FRIENDS...

16:44.730 --> 16:47.460
WITH THE DOCTOR SAYING
EVERYTHING'S IN REMISSION,

16:47.570 --> 16:49.891
KATHY AND I ARE
FEELING VERY...

16:50.000 --> 16:52.309
VERY BLESSED RIGHT NOW.

17:07.920 --> 17:09.649
FRIENDS...

17:09.760 --> 17:11.751
I HAVE BEEN
DIZZY ALL WEEK

17:11.860 --> 17:14.090
AND I HAD TO TAKE
THE BUS HERE.

17:14.200 --> 17:17.624
I NEED SOMEONE
TO GIVE ME A RIDE HOME.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.491
OH...
THANK YOU.

17:37.350 --> 17:39.784
I JUST WANTED TO SAY
HOW GOOD IT FEELS
TO BE HERE.

17:42.190 --> 17:45.023
ALL DAY LONG I DEAL
WITH DEATH...

17:45.130 --> 17:46.381
AND STRESS...

17:49.130 --> 17:51.166
AND IT'S NICE TO BE
IN A PLACE OF PEACE.

17:54.770 --> 17:55.464
THAT'S ALL.

18:07.180 --> 18:10.240
( singing hymn )

19:06.370 --> 19:08.179
IS IT OKAY IF I TAKE
SOME OF THOSE COOKIES
TO WORK?

19:08.280 --> 19:09.702
YOU MADE SO MANY.

19:09.810 --> 19:12.506
- TAKE AS MANY
AS YOU'D LIKE.
- THANKS.

19:15.050 --> 19:16.517
DO YOU WANT SOME HELP?

19:16.620 --> 19:17.609
NO.

19:17.720 --> 19:21.053
I THINK I'VE ALREADY
MADE A MESS OF IT.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.549
I DON'T KNOW WHY I TRY
AND CUT MY OWN HAIR.

19:24.990 --> 19:27.129
PAMPER YOURSELF.
GO TO A SALON.

19:27.230 --> 19:29.448
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE
LIVING ON THE PRAIRIE.

19:36.500 --> 19:39.435
( children's song
playing on TV)

19:39.540 --> 19:42.031
YOU WANT TO GIVE QUAKER CHURCH
ANOTHER CHANCE TOMORROW?

19:42.140 --> 19:45.200
- NOT REALLY.
- Maya: ONE, TWO, FOUR,
THREE, FIVE.

19:45.310 --> 19:48.108
- OKAY.
- WHY?

19:48.220 --> 19:50.245
WELL, MAGGIE'S CAR
IS IN THE SHOP

19:50.350 --> 19:53.717
AND I OFFERED
TO GIVE HER A RIDE, SO...

19:53.820 --> 19:55.913
IT'S 8:30 IN THE MORNING
AND YOU'VE ALREADY TALKED
TO MAGGIE?

19:56.020 --> 19:58.079
- SHE NEEDED A RIDE.
- MMM.

19:58.190 --> 20:00.556
THAT PLACE LOOKED LIKE
IT WAS FULL OF FRIENDS

20:00.660 --> 20:03.299
WHO JUST LOVE
TO BE HER RIDE.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.322
DO YOU WANT TO COME
OR NOT?

20:07.570 --> 20:09.458
ARE YOU REALLY BUYING
INTO THIS?

20:09.570 --> 20:11.765
I'M NOT BUYING
INTO ANYTHING.

20:11.870 --> 20:13.906
SO, WHEN YOU WENT
INTO THAT CHURCH LAST NIGHT,

20:14.010 --> 20:16.672
YOU REALLY BELIEVED
YOU WERE IN THE PRESENCE
OF GOD?

20:16.780 --> 20:19.203
WHAT I SAID WAS
THAT IT FELT LIKE
A PLACE OF PEACE.

20:19.310 --> 20:20.948
WHICH IT ISN'T HERE.

20:21.050 --> 20:24.918
- NOT A LOT LATELY, NO.
- Maya: ONE, TWO, THREE,
FOUR, FIVE.

20:25.020 --> 20:26.715
HEY, SWEETIE.
CAN YOU GET YOUR SHOES
FOR ME,

20:26.820 --> 20:29.880
THEN I'LL GET YOU READY
FOR DAYCARE, OKAY?

20:31.960 --> 20:33.291
THANK YOU.

20:37.270 --> 20:38.396
IT WAS JUST NICE,
BRENDA.

20:38.500 --> 20:39.990
IT WAS REALLY NICE
TO BE AROUND SOME PEOPLE

20:40.100 --> 20:41.590
WHO DIDN'T THINK
THEY KNOW EVERYTHING

20:41.700 --> 20:44.464
AND WHO THOUGHT
THERE MIGHT BE
SOMETHING MORE TO LIFE

20:44.570 --> 20:47.368
THAN WHAT THEY CAN SEE
AND FEEL AND BE RIGHT ABOUT.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.539
WELL, I FEEL
SORRY FOR YOU

20:49.640 --> 20:51.870
THAT YOU HAVE
SUCH EMPTINESS INSIDE YOU

20:51.980 --> 20:55.746
THAT YOU NEED TO FILL IT
WITH SOMETHING SO...
RIDICULOUS.

20:55.850 --> 20:58.387
- YOU REALLY DON'T
BELIEVE IN ANYTHING?
- YOU KNOW I DON'T.

20:58.490 --> 20:59.946
WELL, I FEEL SORRY
FOR YOU THEN.

21:00.050 --> 21:02.712
AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHERE YOU DRAW THE LINE.

21:02.820 --> 21:06.358
THE SERVICE IS BASICALLY
SILENT MEDITATION.
YOU MEDITATE.

21:06.460 --> 21:09.452
YES, BUT I'M NOT WAITING
FOR SOME MYTHICAL,
HISTORICAL GHOST

21:09.560 --> 21:11.528
WITH HIS SHAMING,
BLOOD-SACRIFICE BULLSHIT

21:11.630 --> 21:13.268
TO COME
AND SAVE MY SOUL.

21:13.370 --> 21:15.235
I MEDITATE TO SEE
THE WORLD AS IT IS--

21:15.340 --> 21:17.137
TO ACCEPT THE WORLD,

21:17.240 --> 21:18.662
TO FEEL ALIVE.

21:18.770 --> 21:20.431
AND YOU CAN'T DO THAT
WITH OTHER PEOPLE?

21:20.540 --> 21:22.428
NOT WITH THOSE PEOPLE,
NO.

21:22.540 --> 21:24.747
SO IF I GET INVOLVED
WITH QUAKERISM

21:24.850 --> 21:26.909
OR WHATEVER BECAUSE
IT MAKES SENSE TO ME,

21:27.010 --> 21:29.717
- BECAUSE IT MEANS
SOMETHING TO ME, YOU CAN'T--
- YOU'RE JUST USING THIS

21:29.820 --> 21:31.981
AS A WAY TO DISTANCE YOURSELF
FROM ME AND YOUR BABY,

21:32.090 --> 21:33.910
BECAUSE YOU'RE SCARED
AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

21:34.020 --> 21:36.853
HOW COULD I BE
DISTANCING MYSELF?!
I'M HERE EVERY NIGHT!

21:36.960 --> 21:39.520
NOT TOMORROW NIGHT!
APPARENTLY YOU'D RATHER BE
WITH THAT SAPPY,

21:39.630 --> 21:41.291
- LITTLE FERRET, MAGGIE.
- HEY!

21:41.400 --> 21:43.891
- SHE IS A DEEPLY
KIND PERSON.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.697
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR NOW?
A DEEPLY KIND PERSON?

21:47.800 --> 21:49.438
WELL, I KNOW
I DON'T WANT SOMEONE

21:49.540 --> 21:51.132
WHO MAKES ME FEEL LIKE SHIT
EVERY SECOND OF THE DAY.

21:51.240 --> 21:53.435
IF I'M SO AWFUL,
WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE?

21:53.540 --> 21:56.668
WILL YOU STOP THREATENING ME?
IT'S LIKE YOU THINK YOU CAN
WIN EVERY ARGUMENT

21:56.780 --> 21:59.499
- BY GIVING ME
SOME FUCKING ULTIMATUM!
- NO, IT WAS A QUESTION!

21:59.610 --> 22:01.475
YEAH?
WELL, I'M NOT LEAVING!

22:01.580 --> 22:03.582
MAYBE YOU WANT TO LEAVE,
BUT I'M HERE!

22:03.690 --> 22:05.510
I'M HERE, AND I'M NOT
GOING ANYWHERE!

22:07.290 --> 22:08.848
( sighs )
I GOTTA GO TO WORK.

22:17.160 --> 22:18.889
( knocks )

22:20.500 --> 22:22.058
HEY,ENNY.
WHAT'S UP?

22:22.170 --> 22:24.138
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT THIS IS?

22:24.240 --> 22:27.778
- A SIDE MIRROR.
- CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT IT'S DOING IN MY HAND?

22:27.880 --> 22:29.700
- YOU GOT ME.
- IT'S IN MY HAND

22:29.810 --> 22:32.142
BECAUSE IT'S NO LONGER
ATTACHED TO MY CAR.

22:32.250 --> 22:33.808
AND IT'S NO LONGER
ATTACHED TO MY CAR

22:33.920 --> 22:36.411
BECAUSE YOUR KID KNOCKED IT OFF
WITH YOUR GINORMOUS TRUCK

22:36.520 --> 22:38.579
- TRYING TO PARK LAST WEEK.
- WHAT, DURRELL?

22:38.690 --> 22:40.419
HE'S 12 YEARS OLD, MAN.

22:43.530 --> 22:46.021
( sighs )
OH, FUCKING KID.

22:46.130 --> 22:49.122
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL PAY YOU FOR IT.

22:49.230 --> 22:50.868
$280.00

22:54.300 --> 22:55.892
I'LL--
I'LL WRITE YOU A CHECK.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.900
OKAY.

22:58.010 --> 23:00.478
( people chatting )

23:05.010 --> 23:09.618
SO, WAS THAT YOU I SAW
CRAWLING OUT OF A LIME-GREEN
HEARSE YESTERDAY?

23:09.720 --> 23:12.587
UH, IT'S ACTUALLY MORE
OF AN AVOCADO.

23:12.690 --> 23:16.649
AH. YOU DON'T SEEM
PARTICULARLY GOTH AND...

23:16.760 --> 23:19.581
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE
YOUR OWN BAND, SO...

23:19.690 --> 23:22.420
- MY DAD WAS
A FUNERALABIRECTOR.

23:24.100 --> 23:26.898
- REALLY?
- YEAH. I GREW UP
IN A FUNERAL HOME.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.366
- I STILL LIVE
IN A FUNERAL HOME.
- WOW.

23:29.470 --> 23:31.529
WITH DEAD BODIES
AND EVERYTHING.

23:31.640 --> 23:34.336
- YEP.
- ISN'T THAT
KIND OF SCARY?

23:34.440 --> 23:36.533
- NOT COMPARED TO THIS.
- ( chuckles )

23:46.420 --> 23:48.012
- MMM.
- (chuckles)

23:51.660 --> 23:54.697
"LAC-ARTS JUNIOR SHOW."

23:54.800 --> 23:56.791
- TONIGHT. YOU GOING?
- I DON'T KNOW.

23:56.900 --> 24:00.358
I SAID I WOULD,
BUT I THINK I MIGHT
BECOME CONVENIENTLY SICK.

24:00.470 --> 24:03.132
- NOT INTO IT?
- NO, IT'S JUST
THESE FRIENDS FROM SCHOOL

24:03.240 --> 24:06.698
- WHO I DON'T SEE ANYMORE.
- NO WAY? I GOT
THE SAME THING--

24:06.810 --> 24:09.005
THIS GET-TOGETHER WITH ALL
MY OLD FRATERNITY BROTHERS.

24:09.110 --> 24:12.546
I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO'S NOT
MARRIED OR IN A SERIOUS
RELATIONSHIP,

24:12.650 --> 24:15.278
SO I END UP LOOKING
LIKE A LOSER.

24:15.380 --> 24:18.508
- WHICH YOU ARE.
- BESIDE THE POINT.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.985
HOW ABOUT I GO
WITH YOU TO YOUR THING,

24:24.090 --> 24:26.729
- AND YOU COME
WITH ME TO MINE?
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

24:26.830 --> 24:29.594
YEAH.
WE'LL TAKE MY CAR.

24:31.900 --> 24:33.060
( chuckles )

24:35.970 --> 24:36.937
COOL.

24:40.010 --> 24:42.001
- JUST GOING TO--
- PLEASE.

24:44.980 --> 24:47.778
David:
I THINK IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO PASS UP.

24:50.250 --> 24:53.549
- DID YOU START WITHOUT ME?
- NO, I'M JUST READING
DAVID'S PROPOSAL

24:53.660 --> 24:55.287
WHILE WE WAITED FOR YOU.

24:55.390 --> 24:57.210
PROPOSAL?
WHAT PROPOSAL?

24:57.320 --> 24:59.220
THIS.
I THINK NOW

24:59.330 --> 25:00.695
AT THE END
OF OUR CORPORATE YEAR

25:00.800 --> 25:02.756
INSTEAD OF TAKING
OUR TRADITIONAL BONUSES,

25:02.860 --> 25:05.260
WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT
REINVESTING IN THE COMPANY.

25:05.370 --> 25:09.636
- I'M ALL FOR THAT.
- SO I SUGGEST WE BUY
A CREMATORY.

25:09.740 --> 25:12.300
WHAT?
NO. NO. NO WAY.

25:12.410 --> 25:15.573
- YOU HAVEN'T EVEN READ IT YET.
- PEOPLE WHO WANT THEIR
LOVED ONES CREMATED

25:15.680 --> 25:17.432
ARE PEOPLE WHO DON'T
WANNA SPEND ANYTHING.

25:17.550 --> 25:20.303
- THERE'S NO MONEY
TO BE MADE IN CREMATION.
- OF COURSE, THERE IS.

25:20.410 --> 25:22.514
THERE'S NO OVERHEAD
IF WE OWN OUR OWN.

25:22.620 --> 25:25.612
YEAH, JUST
A $340,000 MORTGAGE.

25:25.720 --> 25:28.086
NO, HERE'S ANOTHER NUMBER
TO THINK ABOUT.

25:31.490 --> 25:36.325
35%. DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT NUMBER IS?

25:36.430 --> 25:39.820
THAT IS THE PERCENTAGE
OF OUR CLIENTELE THAT
WAS LATINO LAST YEAR.

25:39.930 --> 25:42.160
DO YOU KNOW WHY
IT WAS SO HIGH?

25:42.270 --> 25:43.669
I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING.

25:43.770 --> 25:45.169
I'VE ALREADY BEEN CALLED
A RACIST ONCE THIS WEEK.

25:45.270 --> 25:48.979
BECAUSE THE NAME DIAZ
WENT UP ON OUR SIGN.

25:49.080 --> 25:50.900
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
ALL THIS EXTRA MONEY,

25:51.010 --> 25:53.103
BECAUSE I'M BRINGING IN
THE LATINO COMMUNITY.

25:53.210 --> 25:55.747
AND THERE'S NO WAY
THAT I'M VOTING THAT
WE GET A CREMATORY.

25:55.850 --> 25:57.374
SO WHAT IS IT
YOU WANT?

25:57.480 --> 25:59.710
WELL, ANOTHER
SPANISH-SPEAKING EMPLOYEE

25:59.820 --> 26:01.913
TO WORK EXCLUSIVELY
IN COMMUNITY OUTREACH.

26:02.020 --> 26:05.023
FISHER AND DIAZ NEEDS
TO BE A VISIBLE MEMBER
IN OUR COMMUNITY.

26:05.130 --> 26:07.792
WE SHOULD BE SPONSORING
SOCCER TEAMS--

26:07.900 --> 26:09.652
RICO, I'M GONNA
STOP YOU RIGHT THERE.

26:09.760 --> 26:12.069
WE CAN'T THINK OF
ALL THE FUN THINGS
WE'D LIKE TO DO.

26:12.170 --> 26:15.298
- WE HAVE TO PLAN
FOR OUR FUTURE.
- THIS IS OUR FUTURE!

26:15.400 --> 26:18.528
I DON'T THINK
IT'S THE FUTURE
OF FISHER AND DIAZ.

26:18.640 --> 26:22.371
OH, I GET IT.

26:22.480 --> 26:24.209
THE FISHER BOYS
ARE GANGING UP

26:24.310 --> 26:26.801
BECAUSE YOU'RE
AFRAID OF LOSING
A LITTLE CONTROL, HUH?

26:26.910 --> 26:28.741
WAIT, DON'T INCLUDE ME
IN THIS.

26:31.490 --> 26:35.608
( instrumental music
Playing )

26:39.560 --> 26:42.996
- RUTH FISHER.
- HELLO, HIRAM.

26:46.270 --> 26:48.830
HAVE A SEAT,
I'LL BE WITH YOU
IN A MOMENT.

26:48.940 --> 26:52.467
OR IF YOU'D PREFER
ONE OF OUR OTHER STYLISTS...

26:52.570 --> 26:54.629
NO, I'M HERE TO SEE YOU.

26:56.210 --> 26:58.849
I THINK THE LAST THING
WE NEED TO DO IS BUY
A CREMATORY.

26:58.950 --> 27:01.544
- THANK YOU.
- BUT I DON'T AGREE
WITH YOU EITHER.

27:01.650 --> 27:04.084
GOD, THIS WHOLE BUSINESS
IS SO SCREWED UP.

27:04.190 --> 27:05.987
DEATH USED TO BE SOMETHING
THAT HAPPENED AT HOME,

27:06.090 --> 27:07.546
IT WAS TAKEN CARE OF
BY FAMILY

27:07.660 --> 27:09.389
AND ALL THE UNDERTAKER
DID WAS BUILD THE CASKETS.

27:09.490 --> 27:10.980
WE WERE CABINET MAKERS.

27:11.090 --> 27:14.753
OKAY, I'M NOT SURE I KNOW
HOW TO BUILD A CABINET.

27:14.860 --> 27:16.691
IT WASN'T
UNTIL THE CIVIL WAR

27:16.800 --> 27:20.019
THAT THEY NEEDED
TO TRANSPORT BODIES BA HOME
WITHOUT THEM DECOMPOSING

27:20.130 --> 27:22.269
THAT THEY STARTED
EMBALMING THEM.

27:22.370 --> 27:24.759
OF COURSE, SOME ASSHOLE
FIGURED OUT A WAY TO MAKE
MONEY OFF OF IT.

27:24.870 --> 27:27.430
THERE IS NO REAL REASON
FOR MOST OF WHAT WE DO.

27:27.540 --> 27:29.405
WE DON'T NEED
TO EMBALM BODIES.

27:29.510 --> 27:32.638
- WELL, THERE IS
A LITTLE PROBLEM OF SMELL.
- SO WHAT?

27:32.750 --> 27:34.240
THAT'S A PART OF DEATH.

27:34.350 --> 27:36.614
AND I THINK THAT'S
WHERE THIS BUSINESS WENT WRONG.

27:36.720 --> 27:38.915
WE TRIED TO DISGUISE IT,
MAKE IT LOOK PRETTY, NEAT,

27:39.020 --> 27:40.442
AND SOMEONE ELSE'S
PROBLEM.

27:40.550 --> 27:42.108
NATE, DO YOU ACTUALLY
HAVE A PROPOSAL

27:42.220 --> 27:44.529
OR IS THIS JUST MORE
OF A GENERAL LECTURE?

27:44.630 --> 27:46.689
- GREEN FUNERALS.
- OH, BROTHER.

27:46.790 --> 27:49.918
NO CASKETS,
NO TOXIC CHEMICALS
TO LEACH INTO THE SOIL.

27:50.030 --> 27:51.998
AND WE MAKE MONEY
ON THIS HOW?

27:52.100 --> 27:53.362
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
MAKING MONEY.

27:53.470 --> 27:55.062
THIS IS ABOUT
MAKING A BETTER WORLD.

27:55.170 --> 27:56.899
I'M SORRY, BUT A WORLD
THAT I'M BROKE IN

27:57.000 --> 27:58.467
DOESN'T SEEM
BETTER TO ME.

27:58.570 --> 27:59.901
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,

28:00.010 --> 28:02.877
WE FIND A NATURAL SETTING
THAT'S WORTH PRESERVING.

28:02.980 --> 28:05.005
WE GET A CONSERVATION EASEMENT
SO THAT IT'S PROTECTED

28:05.110 --> 28:06.702
FROM BEING DEVELOPED
IN THE FUTURE.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.448
LOOK WHO'S DOING HIS HOMEWORK
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

28:08.550 --> 28:11.041
I JUST KNOW THAT WHEN I DIE,
PLEASE, WRAP ME IN A SHROUD,

28:11.150 --> 28:12.583
PLANT ME NEXT
TO A BEAUTIFUL TREE

28:12.690 --> 28:14.658
SO THAT NOBODY COULD BUILD
A MINI-MALL THERE.

28:14.760 --> 28:17.411
ACCORDING TO YOUR PRE-NEED
YOU WANNA BE CREMATED.

28:17.520 --> 28:20.387
- SO I'LL CHANGE IT.
- NATE.

28:20.490 --> 28:24.859
REALLY, I UNDERSTAND
AND IT ALL SOUNDS
VERY WONDERFUL,

28:24.970 --> 28:28.235
- BUT WE DON'T HAVE
THAT KIND OF MONEY.
- SO WE'LL GET SOME INVESTORS!

28:28.340 --> 28:31.207
JESUS, DAVID,
CAN YOU JUST TRY
TO BE OPTIMISTIC

28:31.310 --> 28:34.529
INSTEAD OF ALWAYS COMING UP
WITH REASONS TO NEVER CHANGE?

28:34.640 --> 28:37.905
IF YOU WANT
TO PURSUE THIS,
YOU HAVE MY BLESSING,

28:38.010 --> 28:40.240
BUT I'M NOT PUTTING
ANY OF OUR MONEY INTO IT.

28:41.550 --> 28:44.417
YEAH, UH,
GREAT MEETING, GUYS.

28:49.960 --> 28:53.157
- HEY, MAN!
- JESUS. HEY, MAN.

28:53.260 --> 28:55.194
- HOW ARE YOU DOING?
- DID YOU MEET CLAIRE?

28:55.300 --> 28:56.722
NO. HEY, I'M LAUDERBACK.

28:56.830 --> 28:59.526
THANKS.
CLAIRE HERE
IS JUST VISITING.

28:59.630 --> 29:02.463
- OH.
- SHE'S ACTUALLY
THE BIGGEST SOAP OPERA STAR

29:02.570 --> 29:05.607
- IN ALL OF HOLLAND.
- COOL.

29:05.710 --> 29:08.873
( slowly)
WELCOME TO AMERICA.

29:10.110 --> 29:11.145
DAN KE.

29:12.980 --> 29:13.742
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

29:13.850 --> 29:15.215
GOOD TO MEET YOU.

29:18.520 --> 29:20.283
LAUDERBACK
INVENTED THIS GAME

29:20.390 --> 29:23.211
WHERE WE'D ALL PUT DIAPERS
ON UNDER OUR PANTS,
GO TO A STRIP CLUB

29:23.320 --> 29:26.483
AND THE FIRST ONE
WHO COULD TAKE A SHIT WHILE
GETTING A LAP DANCE WON.

29:26.590 --> 29:28.194
UGH.

29:28.300 --> 29:30.689
- WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THAT?
- WE WERE IN COLLEGE

29:30.800 --> 29:32.267
AND IDIOTS AND DRUNK.

29:34.040 --> 29:36.031
- I NEVER WON.
- GOOD.

29:38.040 --> 29:39.439
STRANGE TO THINK
THAT THESE WERE

29:39.540 --> 29:41.178
MY BEST FRIENDS
FOR FOUR YEARS.

29:42.440 --> 29:44.601
I HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON
WITH THEM ANYMORE.

29:44.710 --> 29:47.406
THEY'RE ALL BMWS
AND BABY STROLLERS

29:47.510 --> 29:48.818
AND GOLF
ON THE WEEKENDS.

29:48.920 --> 29:50.979
I'M NOT READY TO BE
MY DAD JUST YET.

29:52.450 --> 29:55.351
SO WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE
TO BECOME A LAWYER?

29:56.790 --> 29:58.826
THAT'S WHAT MY DAD IS.

29:58.930 --> 30:01.728
I KNOW,
I'M A COMPLETE HYPOCRITE.

30:01.830 --> 30:03.752
IT'S ACTUALLY
PRETTY GOOD, THOUGH.

30:03.870 --> 30:06.168
MAYBE NOT MY DREAM
COME TRUE, BUT...

30:06.270 --> 30:07.521
I LIKE IT.

30:10.140 --> 30:13.530
I KNEW HE DID IT ONCE.
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS
A REGULAR THING.

30:13.640 --> 30:15.073
WHY THE HELL
DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

30:15.180 --> 30:16.909
BECAUSE I TOOK
CARE OF IT.

30:17.010 --> 30:19.706
YOU'VE GOT TO STOP
BABYING HIM, DAVID.

30:19.810 --> 30:22.472
( sighs )
GRAB THE VEGETABLES,
PLEASE.

30:26.690 --> 30:28.351
YOU ARE GROUNDED,
MY MAN.

30:28.460 --> 30:29.882
I'M ALREADY GROUNDED.

30:29.990 --> 30:32.379
BUT I WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO TELL YOU.

30:35.100 --> 30:37.125
SO ARE YOU GONNA PAY
FOR THAT MIRROR?

30:37.230 --> 30:39.061
IT WAS $280.

30:39.170 --> 30:41.195
I'M NOT PAYING FOR NOTHING.
YOU PAY FOR IT.

30:41.300 --> 30:42.790
YOU DON'T TALK TO ME
THAT WAY, YOU HEAR?

30:42.900 --> 30:45.300
I'LL TALK TO YOU ANYWAY
I WANT TO, BITCH.

30:45.410 --> 30:46.604
THAT'S IT.

30:46.710 --> 30:49.270
COME ON, BIG MAN.
TRY ME!

30:49.380 --> 30:51.644
- ( grunts) OW!
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

30:51.750 --> 30:56.449
LET GO!
COME ON!

30:56.550 --> 30:57.847
THIS IS JIMMY'S.

30:57.950 --> 31:00.612
HE'S SORT OF THE STAR
OF OUR CLASS.

31:00.720 --> 31:02.813
WHY?

31:02.920 --> 31:04.854
( laughs )
WELL...

31:04.960 --> 31:07.895
HIS USE OF GIGANTISM.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.854
SCULPTING HIS LITTLE
CULTURAL TOKENS

31:09.960 --> 31:12.190
BUT ON SUCH HEROIC SCALE.

31:12.300 --> 31:15.360
IT SORT OF FORCES US
TO LOOK DIFFERENTLY AT
THE THINGS THAT...

31:15.470 --> 31:18.268
SURROUND US.
SOUNDS PRETTY STUPID,
DOESN'T IT?

31:20.270 --> 31:23.000
- I LIKE THIS ONE.
- REALLY?

31:23.110 --> 31:25.601
- YEAH.
- YEAH, THIS IS ANITA'S.

31:25.710 --> 31:29.578
IT'S FUNNY.
WE ALWAYS THOUGHT HER WORK
WAS KIND OF SURFACY.

31:29.680 --> 31:31.409
I LIKE IT.

31:40.860 --> 31:42.452
RUSSELL, HEY.

31:42.560 --> 31:44.664
CLAIRE, SHIT, HI.

31:47.800 --> 31:49.939
( Russell groaning )

31:54.680 --> 31:55.908
RUSSELL, THIS IS TED.

31:56.010 --> 31:58.274
- HEY.
- HEY.

31:58.380 --> 32:01.019
YOU HER SECRET SERVICE AGENT?

32:01.120 --> 32:03.577
YES, ACTUALLY I AM.

32:06.150 --> 32:08.789
CLAIRE AND I WENT OUT
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

32:08.890 --> 32:11.324
- AH.
- YUP.

32:11.430 --> 32:14.422
- IT END_ED HORRIBLY.
- ( ClaIre chuckles )

32:14.530 --> 32:17.624
- HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?
- I'VE BEEN-- I'VE BEEN GOOD.

32:17.730 --> 32:20.927
I'VE BEEN REALLY
REALLY GOOD.

32:21.040 --> 32:25.136
MY WORK HAS GONE TO
SOME AMAZING PLACES

32:25.240 --> 32:27.265
SINCE I GOT HIT
BY A CAR.

32:27.370 --> 32:30.168
OH MY GOD.
YOU WERE HIT BY A CAR?

32:30.280 --> 32:32.145
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- UM...

32:32.250 --> 32:34.844
TO BE HONEST,
I PREFER TO...

32:34.950 --> 32:37.669
PROCESS THOSE EMOTIONS

32:37.780 --> 32:39.509
TH ROUGH MY ART.

32:39.620 --> 32:42.316
OH.
BUT YOU'RE OKAY?

32:42.420 --> 32:45.958
I HOPE TO BE--
ONE DAY-- OKAY, YES.

32:47.830 --> 32:49.923
- GOOD.
- AND YOU?

32:50.030 --> 32:52.498
OH, I'M GOOD.
YOU KNOW?

32:52.600 --> 32:55.535
YEAH.
YEAH.

32:56.800 --> 32:58.563
SO...

32:58.670 --> 33:01.707
HEY, I'M GONNA GO FIND
JIMMY, BECAUSE I THINK
HE'S LOOKING FOR ME.

33:01.810 --> 33:04.176
- OKAY.
- AND, UM...

33:05.810 --> 33:08.278
I THINK I SAW
SOME EVIL NINJAS
DOWN THAT HALLWAY.

33:08.380 --> 33:10.018
- I'LL CHECK IT OUT.
- OKAY.

33:13.150 --> 33:14.879
( both chuckle )

33:14.990 --> 33:17.618
SO, YOU DATED HIM?

33:17.720 --> 33:22.191
HE WAS SORT OF MY BOYFRIEND
FOR A WHILE, YEAH.

33:22.300 --> 33:23.824
AND THEN HE WENT GAY.

33:23.930 --> 33:26.125
AND THEN HE ENDED
UP WITH ANITA

33:26.230 --> 33:28.869
AND I SWITCHED
TO JIMMY, I THINK.

33:28.970 --> 33:30.699
IT GETS
KIND OF CONFUSING.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.438
YOU PROBABLY THINK
I'M A FREAK.

33:32.540 --> 33:34.735
I ONCE DATED A GIRL
WHO HAD A PET DONKEY,

33:34.840 --> 33:36.899
SO FAR BE IT FOR ME--

33:37.010 --> 33:38.648
LET'S GET SOME WINE
OR SOMETHING.

33:38.750 --> 33:42.117
WELL WELL WELL.
IF IT ISN'T THE QUEEN
OF DISAPPEARANCE.

33:42.220 --> 33:44.211
- HEY.
- HEY!

33:46.590 --> 33:49.081
THESE ARE MY FRIENDS
JIMMY AND ANITA.
THIS IS TED.

33:49.190 --> 33:50.885
NICE TO MEET YOU. HI.

33:50.990 --> 33:54.289
ARE YOU RICH?
PLEASE BUY MY STUFF.

33:54.400 --> 33:57.096
ACTUALLY, TED WAS JUST
ADMIRING YOUR PHOTOGRAPH.

33:57.200 --> 33:59.691
OH REALLY?
I GOT A WHOLE BOX
OF THEM IN THE CAR.

33:59.800 --> 34:01.097
REALLY.
PLEASE, BUY THEM.

34:01.200 --> 34:05.239
I NEED CLOTHES
AND DRUGS AND SHAMPOO.

34:05.340 --> 34:06.898
SO DID YOU SEE
THE BIG REVIEW

34:07.010 --> 34:10.400
- OF OUR SHOW IN "LA WEEKLY."
- OH, NO, I GUESS I MISSED IT.

34:10.510 --> 34:13.946
THEY SAID THE WAY
JIMMY'S SCULPTURES
CLASHED WITH REALITY

34:14.050 --> 34:15.915
CAUSED A FRISSON.

34:16.020 --> 34:18.989
OH! RUSSELL WAS JUST
LOOKING FOR YOU.

34:19.090 --> 34:21.684
OH JESUS!
I GOTTA HIDE.

34:21.790 --> 34:24.725
IF HE COMES ANYWHERE
NEAR ME, PLEASE TACKLE HIM
AND BEAT HIM UNCONSCIOUS.

34:24.830 --> 34:27.048
- MM-HMM.
- BYE.

34:27.160 --> 34:29.390
WHAT'S WITH HIM
AND RUSSELL?

34:29.500 --> 34:32.492
IT'S SO GREAT.
JIMMY GOT DRUNK AND LET
RUSSELL BLOW HIM.

34:32.600 --> 34:35.398
- NOW RUSSELL'S
MAJORLY IN LOVE.
- OH GOD.

34:35.500 --> 34:37.661
YEAH, IT'S MY NEW
FAVORITE STORY.

34:46.980 --> 34:48.743
( sighs )

34:48.850 --> 34:51.739
I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT IDIOTS
YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH.

34:51.850 --> 34:53.488
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

34:53.590 --> 34:55.751
THEY DON'T LISTEN TO ME.
THEY DON'T RESPECT ME.

34:55.860 --> 34:58.454
YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE, BABY?

34:58.560 --> 35:01.120
VAN ESSA TREATS YOU
LIKE A DOG.

35:01.230 --> 35:03.289
SHE'S NEVER GOING
TO FORGIVE YOU.

35:03.400 --> 35:05.265
YEAH, WELL, I FUCKED UP.

35:05.370 --> 35:08.498
THAT'S WHAT MEN DO.
THEY CAN'T HELP IT.

35:08.600 --> 35:10.238
I'D FORGIVE YOU.

35:14.070 --> 35:16.402
I'D EVEN FORGIVE YOU
A SECOND TIME.

35:16.510 --> 35:19.547
YOU NEED A NICE
MEXICAN GIRL.

35:19.650 --> 35:22.244
NOT ONE OF THOSE PUERTO
RICAN BITCHES.

35:22.350 --> 35:24.910
THEY ALL GOT RAZOR BLADES
IN THEIR PUSSIES.

35:25.020 --> 35:27.511
- WHOA.
- YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE.

35:27.620 --> 35:29.110
A GIRL LIKE ME,

35:29.220 --> 35:31.222
I'D LET YOU BE THE MAN
OF THE HOUSE.

35:31.330 --> 35:34.652
I'D LET YOU DO ANYTHING
YOU WANTED, RICO.

35:34.760 --> 35:36.648
ANYTHING.

35:53.780 --> 35:54.872
DID YOU FIND JIMMY YET?

35:57.320 --> 35:59.584
I'M SUCH A MESS,
I GUESS.

35:59.690 --> 36:02.716
I'M ALWAYS FALLING IN LOVE
WITH PEOPLE WHO HATE ME.

36:04.860 --> 36:06.179
NOT ALWAYS.

36:10.130 --> 36:12.621
THING IS, I'M NOT EVEN
IN LOVE WITH JIMMY.

36:12.730 --> 36:14.436
I WANT TO BE JIMMY.

36:17.340 --> 36:20.730
AND THE PARADOXICAL
THING IS

36:20.840 --> 36:22.501
UNDERNEATH A OF THAT...

36:24.280 --> 36:25.941
I HATE JIMMY.

36:28.280 --> 36:29.975
HE'S...

36:30.080 --> 36:32.287
HE'S SO SELF-ABSORBED.

36:34.290 --> 36:37.111
HE BUILDS
A SEVEN-FOOT SCULPTURE

36:37.220 --> 36:39.154
OF HIS PENIS.

36:39.260 --> 36:41.399
IT'S A LOLLIPOP.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.422
IT'S SUBLIMINAL, CLAIRE.

36:44.930 --> 36:47.569
HEY, I'M SORRY,
YOU KNOW?

36:51.070 --> 36:52.958
ABOUT THE COLLAGE STUFF

36:53.070 --> 36:55.231
AND TAKING
ALL THE CREDIT.

36:55.340 --> 36:57.570
IT WAS PART YOURS.

37:06.320 --> 37:08.311
IT'S GOOD SEEING
YOU, CLAIRE.

37:08.420 --> 37:10.559
( whispering )
YOU TOO.

37:17.130 --> 37:19.291
( sighs )

37:28.680 --> 37:30.705
Olivier:
AVOID THE SHRIMP ROLLS.

37:30.810 --> 37:33.449
THEY SEEM TO BE COVERED
WITH FECAL MATTER.

37:33.550 --> 37:36.110
- OLIVIER.
- CLAIRE.

37:36.220 --> 37:38.017
ONE OF MY MOST BRILLIANT
STUDENTS.

37:38.120 --> 37:41.908
AND THE SMARTEST.
WHICH, OF COURSE YOU KNOW,
IS NOT THE SAME THING.

37:42.020 --> 37:43.783
GOD, SHUT UP.

37:43.890 --> 37:45.482
( laughs )
SHE SMILES.

37:45.590 --> 37:47.558
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG
IT'S BEEN SINCE I SAW
THAT SMILE?

37:47.660 --> 37:49.799
WHERE'S YOUR
SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS?

37:49.900 --> 37:51.151
I GUESS I LOST IT.

37:51.260 --> 37:54.058
SO, WHO'S THIS YOUNG MAN
YOU'RE WITH TONIGHT?

37:54.170 --> 37:56.991
I'D INTRODUCE YOU TO HIM,
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU
TO FUCK HIM.

37:57.100 --> 37:58.806
( laughs )

37:58.910 --> 38:02.437
THERE'S YOUR SELF-
RIGHTEOUSNESS, CLAIRE.

38:02.540 --> 38:05.907
SPEAKING OF EX-BOYFRIENDS
OF MINE WHOM YOU'VE
HAD SEX WITH,

38:06.010 --> 38:07.204
I HEARD BILLY QUIT.

38:07.310 --> 38:09.847
YEAH, WELL, APPARENTLY
YOU CRUSHED HIM.

38:09.950 --> 38:11.269
MM-HMM.

38:12.550 --> 38:14.586
SO YOU GOT ANYTHING
HANGING ON THE WALL?

38:14.690 --> 38:16.510
NADA.

38:16.620 --> 38:20.181
I STILL PAINT,
BUT IT'S ALL SHIT.

38:20.290 --> 38:21.621
AND THE ONLY PERSON
WHO BUYS MY ART

38:21.730 --> 38:23.721
IS MY RICH PATRON
OF A MISTRESS.

38:23.830 --> 38:26.890
DO YOU KNOW THE HUMILIATION
INVOLVED IN THAT?

38:27.000 --> 38:28.092
I'M SORRY.

38:28.200 --> 38:30.293
WE ALL GO THROUGH
FALLOW PERIODS

38:30.400 --> 38:32.459
WHEN WE MUST LET
THE SOIL REST

38:32.570 --> 38:34.674
TO PREPARE FOR NEW GROWTH.

38:34.780 --> 38:36.771
REALLY?

38:36.880 --> 38:38.438
YOU THINK THAT'S TRUE?

38:38.550 --> 38:41.974
OH GOD,
PLEASE LET IT BE TRUE,
OTHERWISE I'M DOOMED.

38:42.080 --> 38:45.049
I'D HAVE TO STOP TEACHING
AND START DRIVING A CAB.

38:45.150 --> 38:46.549
( laughs )
YOU DON'T DRIVE.

38:46.650 --> 38:48.754
OH, WELL, THEN
I'M REALLY FUCKED,
AREN'T I?

38:51.090 --> 38:52.182
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

38:52.290 --> 38:54.121
I HAVEN'T TAKEN
A PHOTOGRAPH IN MONTHS.

38:54.230 --> 38:57.199
OH, FUCK ART.
I MEAN WHAT HAVE YOU
BEEN DOING?

38:57.300 --> 38:59.427
UH, WORKING
AT A SHITTY JOB.

38:59.530 --> 39:02.397
- MM-HMM.
- FEELING SORRY FOR MYSELF.

39:02.500 --> 39:05.731
GOING HOME EVERY NIGHT
PRETTY MUCH HATING MY LIFE.

39:07.640 --> 39:08.902
IT SUCKS,
DOESN'T IT?

39:10.410 --> 39:13.345
( woman screams )

39:13.450 --> 39:16.442
( groaning )

39:16.550 --> 39:20.111
AH, HE'S INDESTRUCTIBLE.
HE'S FUCKING INDESTRUCTIBLE.

39:20.220 --> 39:21.448
FUCKING BITCH!
I'LL KILL YOU.

39:22.990 --> 39:25.322
( shrieks, hisses )

39:25.430 --> 39:26.852
AH, THEATER.

39:28.660 --> 39:30.059
Russell:
DON'T TOUCH ME!

39:32.970 --> 39:34.790
THIS IS GOING TO BE
PRETTY INCONVENIENT

39:34.900 --> 39:36.333
WHEN I WANT TO BUTTER
MY TOAST IN THE MORNING.

39:36.440 --> 39:39.204
USE A SPOON.

39:39.310 --> 39:40.902
CHOPSTICKS?

39:41.010 --> 39:43.376
YOU CAN KILL A MAN
WITH A CHOPSTICK, DAVID.

39:43.480 --> 39:46.677
DON'T YOU THINK THIS
IS A LITTLE DRASTIC?

39:46.780 --> 39:49.578
- HE PULLED A KNIFE ON ME.
- YOU SCARED HIM.

39:49.680 --> 39:51.648
GOTTA GET A STRONGER LOCK
FOR HIS BEDROOM DOOR.

39:51.750 --> 39:54.685
THAT WAY WE KNOW
WHEN WE PUT HIM IN THERE
HE STAYS IN THERE.

39:54.790 --> 39:56.951
- WHAT IF THERE'S A FIRE?
- LET HIM BURN.

40:00.890 --> 40:03.427
I WAS NERVOUS ABOUT SEEING
EVERYONE TONIGHT.

40:03.530 --> 40:07.193
LIKE THEY WERE ALL MOVING
FORWARD WITH THEIR LIVES

40:07.300 --> 40:09.336
AND ALL DOING AMAZING THINGS

40:09.440 --> 40:11.362
WHILE I WAS
GOING NOWHERE, BUT...

40:11.470 --> 40:14.598
GOD, THEY'RE ALL EXACTLY
WHERE I LEFT THEM.

40:14.710 --> 40:17.031
AND THAT MAKES YOU FEEL?

40:17.140 --> 40:19.802
( laughs )
REALLY GOOD.

40:20.910 --> 40:22.775
I HAD A LOT
OF FUN TONIGHT.

40:22.880 --> 40:24.609
YEAH, ME TOO.

40:28.490 --> 40:30.310
SO, I'LL SEE YOU
TOMORROW.

40:30.420 --> 40:31.887
9:00.

40:33.490 --> 40:34.718
YEAH.

40:37.860 --> 40:41.569
I HAD NO IDEA EATING
DINNER ON A PILLOW COULD
BE SO MUCH FUN.

40:41.670 --> 40:44.366
IT MAKES ME
WANT TO TH ROW AWAY
EVERY CHAIR IN THE HOUSE.

40:44.470 --> 40:46.006
IF YOU WANT
THE FULL EXPERIENCE,

40:46.110 --> 40:48.362
YOU'LL HAVE TO LET ME
TAKE YOU TO MOROCCO.

40:48.480 --> 40:50.539
WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE
TO ENJOY OUR APERITIF?

40:50.640 --> 40:52.505
YOUR SUN PORCH?

40:52.610 --> 40:55.477
I WAS THINKING WE COULD
TAKE IT UPSTAIRS

40:55.580 --> 40:57.969
- TO THE BEDROOM.
- ( both laugh )

40:58.080 --> 40:59.786
WHAT?

40:59.890 --> 41:02.358
ALL THE WAY BACK
I WAS PRACT ICING
HOW TO SAY THAT.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.280
IT SOUNDED SO SILLY.

41:04.390 --> 41:06.153
I SHOULD HAVE
JUST DONE THIS.

41:18.940 --> 41:20.862
Brenda:
HE WON'T EVEN CONSIDER
THAT WHAT I'M SAYING

41:20.970 --> 41:23.734
MIGHT ACTUALLY BE VALID.
HE JUST WANTS ME
TO AGREE WITH HIM

41:23.840 --> 41:26.946
AND SAY, "WOW, NATE!
GEE, YEAH.

41:27.050 --> 41:29.541
QUAKERS. I NEVER THOUGHT
OF IT LIKE THAT."

41:29.650 --> 41:31.914
HE HATES THE FACT
THAT I'M QUESTIONING

41:32.020 --> 41:35.410
WHY HE'S BEING DRAWN
TO SOMETHING THAT HE KNOWS
WE CAN'T POSSIBLY SHARE.

41:35.520 --> 41:37.511
BRENDA, PLEASE
SHUT THE FUCK UP.

41:37.620 --> 41:39.588
I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.

41:39.690 --> 41:42.557
ALL DAY LONG I HAVE TO LISTEN
TO MY STUDENTS COMPLAIN
ABOUT THEIR PROBLEMS,

41:42.660 --> 41:46.289
AND WHEN I FINALLY GET A BREAK,
I HAVE TO LISTEN TO YOU
GO ON ABOUT YOURS.

41:46.400 --> 41:49.198
- OKAY.
- HONESTLY, I SHOULD TAPE
ONE OF YOUR MONOLOGUES

41:49.300 --> 41:52.269
BECAUSE YOU SAY THE SAME
FUCKING THING EVERY TIME.

41:52.370 --> 41:55.407
IF YOU WANT
TO CHANGE THE DYNAMIC
OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP,

41:55.510 --> 41:57.239
THEN YOU NEED TO CHANGE.

41:57.340 --> 41:59.900
IF YOU WANT HIM
TO OPEN UP TO YOU, YOU NEED
TO OPEN UP TO HIM.

42:00.010 --> 42:03.275
THERE, I'VE SAID IT.
THANK GOD.

42:03.380 --> 42:05.883
NOW CAN WE PLEASE TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING MEANINGLESS

42:05.990 --> 42:08.686
LIKE LAST NIGHT'S
EPISODE OF "AMERICAN IDOL"?
THANK YOU.

42:10.690 --> 42:12.555
I'VE NEVER WATCHED
"AMERICAN IDOL."

42:12.660 --> 42:15.891
WELL, LET ME KNOW
WHEN YOU HAVE, OKAY?

42:19.800 --> 42:22.439
THAT WAS DELICIOUS, HARIM.
WHAT A TREAT.

42:22.540 --> 42:25.634
MY PLEASURE.
I'LL CLEAN UP, THEN I SHOULD
PROBABLY GET GOING.

42:26.740 --> 42:28.298
LET'S GO CAMPING.

42:30.210 --> 42:31.279
TODAY?

42:31.380 --> 42:32.699
RIGHT NOW.

42:35.380 --> 42:37.075
OKAY.
( laughs )

42:39.550 --> 42:41.438
Anthony:
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
MAKE US LUNCH.

42:41.550 --> 42:43.051
OF COURSE I'M GONNA
MAKE YOU LUNCHES.

42:43.160 --> 42:45.720
I DON'T WANT YOU EATING
THAT AWFUL CAFETERIA FOOD.

42:45.830 --> 42:47.684
I MEAN,
IF YOU'RE MAD AT US.

42:47.790 --> 42:50.850
I'M NOT MAD AT YOU.
I'M MAD AT DURRELL.

42:50.960 --> 42:53.929
HE ONLY DOES BAD STUFF
BECAUSE HE WANTS
TO HAVE FUN.

42:54.030 --> 42:56.464
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S NOT
A VERY GOOD REASON.

42:56.570 --> 42:59.107
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU
GIVE US BACK.

43:03.280 --> 43:04.338
WHAT?

43:04.440 --> 43:07.273
EVERYBODY ALWAYS
GIVES US BACK.

43:07.380 --> 43:08.608
WHO?

43:08.720 --> 43:10.039
OUR FOSTER PARENTS.

43:10.150 --> 43:12.710
SO DURRELL WANTS TO HAVE FUN
WHILE WE'RE HERE.

43:15.390 --> 43:16.857
( sighs )

43:18.860 --> 43:21.351
( organ music playing )

43:28.170 --> 43:29.865
Seor.

43:29.970 --> 43:32.063
Muchas gracias,
Padre.

43:32.170 --> 43:33.467
Gracias.

43:33.570 --> 43:35.435
AH, THERE YOU ARE.

43:35.540 --> 43:37.508
$400 FOR 50 DOVES.

43:37.610 --> 43:39.202
I'M THROWING IN
AN EXTRA 20 DOVES.

43:39.310 --> 43:42.040
- WE APPRECIATE YOUR BUSINESS.
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

43:42.150 --> 43:43.242
THANK YOU.

43:45.550 --> 43:50.010
( speaking Spanish )

43:54.960 --> 43:56.655
- Gracias.
- Por favor.

44:05.040 --> 44:07.235
(crying )

44:16.250 --> 44:18.571
HEY, UH, CAN YOU HELP ME
WITH SOMETHING?

44:18.690 --> 44:20.681
I NEED A NEW CARTRIDGE
FOR MY PRINTER.

44:20.790 --> 44:22.257
SUPPLY CLOSET.

44:28.460 --> 44:30.655
I THINK THEY'RE STACKED
UP HERE.

44:52.790 --> 44:54.189
( doorbell rings )

44:58.520 --> 45:00.021
- HEY.
- HEY.

45:00.130 --> 45:02.291
- YOU'RE HERE.
- YEAH, SORRY I'M
A LITTLE EARLY.

45:02.400 --> 45:03.924
IT'S OKAY.
COME ON IN.

45:06.130 --> 45:08.735
AD TO GET OUT OF THE OFFICE.
SOMETIMES IT'S JUST...

45:08.840 --> 45:11.229
TOO FUCKING DEPRESSING,
YOU KNOW?

45:11.340 --> 45:13.035
ROUGH DAY?

45:13.140 --> 45:14.437
YEAH.

45:14.540 --> 45:17.737
- YOU WANT
SOMETHING TO DRINK?
- WATER, THANKS.

45:17.840 --> 45:20.047
OKAY.
MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME.

45:23.620 --> 45:25.440
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

45:25.550 --> 45:28.417
UH, NOTHING.

45:28.520 --> 45:29.714
HERE.

45:29.820 --> 45:31.219
SIT DOWN.

45:38.160 --> 45:39.866
IT'S...

45:39.970 --> 45:42.336
BRENDA AND I LATELY,
IT JUST FEELS LIKE
WE'RE FIGHTING

45:42.440 --> 45:44.294
EVEN WHEN WE'RE NOT.

45:44.400 --> 45:49.508
THERE'S ALWAYS THIS
UNDERLYING LAYER OF TENSION,

45:49.610 --> 45:51.407
RESENTM ENT,
WHATEVER.

45:53.250 --> 45:55.673
WELL, BEING MARRIED
ISN'T EASY.

45:55.780 --> 45:57.247
I KNOW THAT.

45:59.050 --> 46:00.347
YEAH, WE JUST SEE THE WORLD

46:00.450 --> 46:02.589
IN SUCH COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
WAYS, YOU KNOW?

46:02.690 --> 46:05.227
YEAH?

46:05.330 --> 46:08.288
I GUESS I CONVENIENTLY IGNORED
THAT FACT WHEN WE GOT MARRIED.

46:12.030 --> 46:14.328
I'M SORRY.
I COME IN HERE, I START
UNLOADING ALL MY SHIT.

46:14.430 --> 46:15.590
IT'S OKAY.

46:15.700 --> 46:18.567
IT'LL BE NICE
TONIGHT JUST TO...

46:18.670 --> 46:22.106
GO TO THE MEETING
AND BE QUIET.

46:22.210 --> 46:26.078
YEAH, I THINK OF IT
AS MY LANDING STRIP.

46:26.180 --> 46:29.274
YOU KNOW, NO MATTER
HOW WEIRD THE DAY GETS

46:29.380 --> 46:30.608
OR HOW MUCH GOES WRONG,

46:30.720 --> 46:32.449
I CAN ALWAYS GO
TO A FRIENDS MEETING

46:32.550 --> 46:35.417
AND LAND.
( laughs )

46:36.760 --> 46:39.285
- SO HOW ARE YOU?
- OH GOD.

46:39.390 --> 46:40.789
YOU ADJUSTING TO L.A.?

46:40.890 --> 46:42.824
WELL, I, UH,

46:42.930 --> 46:46.866
I LOOK OUT MY WINDOW
EVERY MORNING AND I WONDER
HOW I GOT HERE.

46:48.170 --> 46:50.593
AND THEN I THINK
I WAS ON MY WAY OUT,

46:50.700 --> 46:53.032
AND MY DAD
BEGGED ME TO STAY.

46:53.140 --> 46:55.677
THAT IS EXACTLY HOW
I WOUND UP BACK HERE.

46:55.780 --> 46:58.840
AFTER MY DAD DIED
MY MOTHER ASKED ME

46:58.950 --> 47:00.474
TO STICK AROUND.

47:00.580 --> 47:02.810
- ANY REGRETS?
-(laughs)

47:02.920 --> 47:05.912
THAT BECOMING THE ONE THING
I NEVER WANTED TO BE.

47:06.020 --> 47:08.409
-(laughs)
- OH YEAH.

47:08.520 --> 47:10.579
OR NOT.
I DON'T KNOW.

47:12.230 --> 47:14.949
FOR A WHILE I WAS THINKING
I WAS REALLY HELPING PEOPLE.

47:18.600 --> 47:21.228
LATELY THE WHOLE BUSINESS
JUST SEEMS UNNECESSARY.

47:25.440 --> 47:26.805
I JUST FEEL USELESS.

47:26.910 --> 47:29.208
NATE, YOU ARE FAR
FROM USELESS.

47:29.310 --> 47:32.404
I DON'T JUST MEAN AT WORK.
I MEAN EVERYWHERE.

47:32.510 --> 47:35.240
WE MAY HAVE THIS
HANDICAPPED CHILD, RIGHT?

47:37.320 --> 47:39.686
AND THERE IS NOT A DAMNED
THING I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

47:39.790 --> 47:41.280
I CAN'T MAKE
THE BABY HEALTHY.

47:41.390 --> 47:43.312
I CAN'T MAKE MYSELF FEEL
ANY MORE READY TO DEAL WITH IT.

47:43.420 --> 47:47.356
I CAN'T EVEN MAKE
MYSELF WANT TO DEAL WITH IT.
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

47:47.460 --> 47:48.484
( sighs )

47:48.590 --> 47:51.252
YOU'RE ALLOWED
TO BE SCARED.

47:51.360 --> 47:54.090
LIFE IS SCARY.

47:55.400 --> 47:57.937
( laughs )
YEAH, IT'S FUCKING
TERRIFYING.

48:23.930 --> 48:25.989
NATE.

48:26.100 --> 48:27.658
- NO, THIS IS--
- SHH, SHH.

48:52.290 --> 48:54.019
( sighs )

49:07.070 --> 49:08.708
( door opening )

49:09.780 --> 49:12.908
- HEY.
- HEY.

49:13.010 --> 49:15.274
WHERE ARE THE BOYS?

49:15.380 --> 49:17.974
THEY'RE AT YOUR MOTHER'S.
YOU CAN PICK THEM UP
TOMORROW MORNING.

49:19.850 --> 49:21.408
THIS USED TO BE
OUR PIZZA NIGHT.

49:21.520 --> 49:24.580
YEAH, WELL, THERE'S A LOT
OF THINGS THAT USED TO BE.

49:29.460 --> 49:31.758
YOU COULDN'T EVEN WAIT
TO HAVE DINNER WITH ME?

49:31.860 --> 49:34.624
HERE.
FINISH IT.

49:40.370 --> 49:42.133
VANESSA...

49:44.510 --> 49:45.977
DO WHAT?

49:46.080 --> 49:47.843
I FEEL LIKE--

49:47.950 --> 49:50.373
I FEEL LIKE I'M JUST THE GUY
WHO MOWS THE LAWN

49:50.480 --> 49:53.517
AND TAKES OUT THE TRASH
AND OCCASIONALLY GETS
TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU

49:53.620 --> 49:55.588
WHILE YOU LAY THERE LOOKING
BORED OUT OF YOUR MIND.

49:55.690 --> 49:57.658
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU EXPECTED
WHEN YOU CAME BACK.

49:57.760 --> 50:00.388
I WAS EXPECTING YOU TO TRY
TO MAKE THIS WORK.

50:00.490 --> 50:02.822
YOU KNOW, IF WE'RE
GONNA BE MARRIED,

50:02.930 --> 50:04.352
THEN LET'S BE MARRIED.

50:04.460 --> 50:06.690
BUT IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT
AND YOU DON'T LOVE
ME ANYMORE,

50:06.800 --> 50:09.064
THEN I DON'T
WANT TO BE HERE.
I'LL MOVE OUT.

50:13.040 --> 50:14.769
RICO, I DO LOVE YOU.

50:14.870 --> 50:16.770
I REALLY DO,
BUT I CANNOT--

50:18.840 --> 50:20.341
I CAN'T GET OVER THIS.

50:20.450 --> 50:21.474
EVE R?

50:24.120 --> 50:27.749
- YOU CAN'T EVER
GET OVER THIS?
- HOPEFULLY...

50:27.850 --> 50:29.681
EVENTUALLY.

50:29.790 --> 50:31.382
BUT WHY?

50:31.490 --> 50:35.426
WHY? YOU KNOW
I'LL NEVER DO ANYTHING
LIKE THAT AGAIN.

50:35.530 --> 50:37.691
I KNOW, BUT--

50:37.800 --> 50:42.089
DON'T ASK ME TO EXPLAIN.
IT'S NOT A MENTAL THING.

50:42.200 --> 50:43.531
IT'S JUST--
THIS IS HOW I FEEL.

50:52.680 --> 50:53.977
SO WHAT
DO WE DO NOW?

50:54.080 --> 50:55.240
I DON'T KNOW.

51:13.400 --> 51:15.436
IT HAS
TOO MUCH SALT.

51:15.540 --> 51:18.259
( laughs )
I KNOW, IT'S REALLY BAD.

51:21.310 --> 51:22.800
YOU WANT TO GO OUT
AND GET SOMETHING TO EAT?

51:25.580 --> 51:26.376
YEAH.

51:36.460 --> 51:38.212
( whispers )
MY KNIFE BROKE.

51:38.320 --> 51:40.857
THAT'S OKAY, ANTHONY.

51:40.960 --> 51:43.121
WE HAVE A WHOLE
BOX OF THEM.

51:43.230 --> 51:45.790
I TOLD ROGER
I'M GONNA WANT
A COUPLE OF WEEKS OFF

51:45.900 --> 51:48.323
- AS SOON AS SCHOOL'S OUT.
- OH?

51:48.430 --> 51:50.569
I WAS THINKING
WE'D GO ON VACATION.

51:50.670 --> 51:52.308
YOU KNOW, GO DOWN
TO MEXICO.

51:52.410 --> 51:54.207
GO SWIMMING
IN THE OCEAN.

51:54.310 --> 51:56.505
BUT WHO'S GONNA
TAKE CARE OF US?

51:58.010 --> 51:59.272
YOU'RE COMING WITH US.

52:02.780 --> 52:04.543
I DON'T WANT TO SWIM.

52:04.650 --> 52:07.414
I WANT TO GO
TO THE MOUNTAINS
AND LEARN TO SNOWBOARD.

52:07.520 --> 52:09.681
WE CAN DO THAT
IN THE WINTER.

52:09.790 --> 52:11.781
ALL FOUR OF US.

52:11.890 --> 52:13.824
WE'LL GO ALL KINDS
OF PLACES.

52:16.360 --> 52:17.691
YES, WE WILL!
( chuckles )

52:28.340 --> 52:30.479
Ruth:
IT SMELLS SO GOOD
UP HERE.

52:30.580 --> 52:32.878
THIS IS THE WAY THE WORLD
IS SUPPOSED TO SMELL.

52:32.980 --> 52:34.607
- AND LISTEN.
- WHAT?

52:34.710 --> 52:37.611
DID YOU HEAR IT?
THERE'S A RIVER ABOUT
A HALF MILE DOWN.

52:37.720 --> 52:39.347
WE CAN GO FISHING
IN THE MORNING.

52:39.450 --> 52:41.589
- OH, THIS IS WONDERFUL!
-(laughs)

52:41.690 --> 52:45.080
I FEEL SO COMPLETELY FREE!
THERE'S NO ONE WAITING FOR ME

52:45.190 --> 52:47.226
OR EXPECTING ME
TO DO ANYTHING!

52:47.330 --> 52:49.821
YOU CAN DO
ANYTHING YOU PLEASE.

52:49.930 --> 52:53.969
- EXACTLY.
- ( chuckles )

52:54.070 --> 52:56.197
Nate:
I GUESS WE MISSED
THE CHURCH SERVICE, HUH?

52:56.300 --> 52:57.460
( chuckles )

53:05.350 --> 53:07.875
( exhales )

53:07.980 --> 53:09.572
- ARE YOU CRYING?
- NO.

53:12.250 --> 53:14.445
NO, I'M OKAY.

53:14.550 --> 53:17.758
( sighs )

53:19.890 --> 53:20.959
YOU SHOULD GET GOING.

53:24.330 --> 53:26.389
- ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT?
- I'M FINE.

53:30.670 --> 53:31.694
YOU SHOULD GO.

53:50.090 --> 53:51.819
THIS WASN'T PLANNED,
YOU KNOW.

53:51.920 --> 53:53.387
I KNOW.

53:57.160 --> 53:58.821
( breathing heavily)

54:03.000 --> 54:04.069
WHAT?

54:04.170 --> 54:05.967
MY ARM IS NUMB.

54:06.070 --> 54:07.935
(slurring )
NUMB ARM.

54:08.040 --> 54:11.407
NUMB ARM, NUMB--

54:11.510 --> 54:13.000
- ( snorts )
- NATE!

54:13.110 --> 54:15.578
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

54:15.680 --> 54:17.568
OH MY GOD.

54:20.020 --> 54:22.284
( eerie music playing )

54:25.430 --> 54:26.783
( phone touchtones )
