WEBVTT

00:02.419 --> 00:04.587
Merry Christmas, gentlemen.

00:05.505 --> 00:07.507
So, Hank, what's with the black suit?

00:07.590 --> 00:08.883
Someone die?

00:10.218 --> 00:13.430
Oh, right, someone did die.

00:13.513 --> 00:16.516
Your, uh, mom's best friend as I recall.

00:19.310 --> 00:20.645
Well, this is awkward.

00:23.273 --> 00:24.733
Merry Christmas?

01:02.228 --> 01:03.980
That was Lottie Bonner's lawyer.

01:04.064 --> 01:07.567
Lottie left me all
her lovely antique furniture.

01:07.650 --> 01:08.943
I'm so touched.

01:09.027 --> 01:11.446
I don't know whether to laugh or cry.

01:11.529 --> 01:15.200
Uh, so your best bet is,
you know, neither.

01:15.283 --> 01:19.579
Oh, of course, I'll never be able
to get it all back to Arizona.

01:19.662 --> 01:23.166
Well, heck, Mom, I can move
that stuff out to Arizona for you easy.

01:23.291 --> 01:24.125
Oh, but--

01:24.209 --> 01:26.669
I will be at your door by Christmas Eve.

01:26.753 --> 01:29.380
Heck, all I have to do
is rent a moving van.

01:29.464 --> 01:33.301
Oh, Hank, are you sure
a van is big enough?

01:37.680 --> 01:40.183


01:49.859 --> 01:53.071
<i>♪ Grandma got run over by a reindeer ♪</i>

01:53.822 --> 01:57.158
<i>♪ Walkin' home from our house
Christmas Eve ♪</i>

01:57.242 --> 01:58.743
That is a big van.

01:59.327 --> 02:00.703
Holy crap!

02:00.787 --> 02:01.704
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

02:01.788 --> 02:04.207
-Look at the size of that ol' rig, man!
-Oh, my goodness!

02:06.668 --> 02:10.088
I'm gonna name her Wonder Truck.

02:10.171 --> 02:11.297
Ask him. Ask him.

02:11.381 --> 02:14.092
Hank, we want to ask you one question.

02:14.217 --> 02:16.094
You can't come with me on the trip.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.680
I have a follow-up question.

02:18.763 --> 02:21.850
Oh, please!
Please let us come on Wonder Truck!

02:21.933 --> 02:24.853
The next one who asks to come
won't even get to look at it.

02:26.855 --> 02:27.939
Okay, then.

02:31.192 --> 02:32.152
Huh.

02:32.235 --> 02:34.821
I know it's more cargo space than I need,

02:34.904 --> 02:37.240
but, uh, well, there's a sleeper cab,

02:37.323 --> 02:38.950
so I'll save on motels,

02:39.033 --> 02:41.870
and, you know, uh...

02:41.953 --> 02:44.330
Hank, you don't have to explain to us.

02:46.374 --> 02:47.750
Wow...

02:52.672 --> 02:54.674
Look at all this cool stuff!

02:54.757 --> 02:56.509
This isn't a toy, Bobby.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.803
To a trucker, these are tools.

02:58.887 --> 03:01.222
See, truckers are the last cowboys.

03:01.306 --> 03:03.975
They're their own bosses
making tough decisions,

03:04.058 --> 03:06.311
winning or losing by the calls they make,

03:06.394 --> 03:08.813
answering only to the road.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.106
Sounds hard.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.065
It is.

03:11.149 --> 03:14.319
Now, how would you like
to make this trip with your old man?

03:14.402 --> 03:15.361
Heck, yeah!

03:16.029 --> 03:20.074
Dad, can I have permission
to say, "Hell, yeah"?

03:20.158 --> 03:21.284
Just a moment.

03:23.453 --> 03:24.537
Hell, yeah!

03:25.371 --> 03:28.166
It's such a fine night

03:28.249 --> 03:31.502
to, uh, look at the, uh, moon.

03:31.586 --> 03:35.131
Look how big and powerful
the moon looks in the moonlight.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.675
Ready for its trip to Arizona.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.552
It's just not fair!

03:39.636 --> 03:41.137
The moon, I mean.

03:41.763 --> 03:42.847
Oh...

03:46.726 --> 03:49.103
This is a dream come true.

03:49.187 --> 03:52.649
A trucker and his boy alone with their rig
on the open road.

03:52.732 --> 03:53.942
But don't worry, Peggy.

03:54.025 --> 03:56.027
We'll do a quick turnaround
and be back home

03:56.110 --> 03:57.487
by Christmas morning sharp.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.865
A trucker and his boy.

04:01.407 --> 04:05.161
And they've promised their mom
to be home by Christmas.

04:05.787 --> 04:08.998
Hank, this is one
of those novelty Christmas songs

04:09.082 --> 04:11.209
that always sells
a million freaking copies!

04:11.334 --> 04:14.003
I have always wanted
to get in on that racket!

04:14.087 --> 04:16.214
Okay, let's roll.

04:16.297 --> 04:17.215
Well, all right.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.384
Okay, Bobby, we got to stay on time,

04:19.467 --> 04:21.302
so drink up and let's hit the road.

04:21.386 --> 04:22.470
Coffee?

04:22.553 --> 04:23.680
For me?

04:25.390 --> 04:27.558
Mmm...

04:30.311 --> 04:33.064
I don't think I can ever go back to cocoa!

04:33.147 --> 04:36.109
See, trucking
is like a lot of things in life.

04:36.192 --> 04:37.986
Know your rig inside out.

04:38.069 --> 04:40.571
Take care of your rig
and she'll take care of you.

04:40.655 --> 04:44.033
Dad, you know everything.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.619
Well, I do have a Class "C" license.

04:50.081 --> 04:51.749
<i>♪ We're stowing away ♪</i>

04:51.833 --> 04:53.793
<i>♪ We're stowing away ♪</i>

04:55.253 --> 04:56.546
We're so bad.

04:58.214 --> 04:59.257
Ooh-ee, man, look at that!

04:59.340 --> 05:01.759
Man, it's like, uh...
like goddang ol' <i>Ben-Hur</i>, man.

05:04.012 --> 05:05.430
Holy cow...

05:07.348 --> 05:09.017
Boy, look at that view.

05:09.100 --> 05:12.228
This is probably how it looked
to the very first truckers.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.480
Now, the trick to heading up a steep grade

05:14.564 --> 05:16.232
is to shift gears carefully.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.358
And why is that?

05:17.442 --> 05:20.278
"A trucker always protects his cargo."

05:22.322 --> 05:24.282
My dearest Nancy,

05:24.365 --> 05:28.202
I have many questions
about the outside world.

05:28.286 --> 05:30.580
Is our government still intact?

05:30.663 --> 05:32.790
And what of young Joseph?

05:36.336 --> 05:38.713
Gentlemen, to your racers.

05:41.132 --> 05:42.050
Yay!

05:43.551 --> 05:44.427
Ah...

05:44.510 --> 05:45.553
-Cheaters!
-Yay!

05:45.636 --> 05:48.389
He was... Oh, no!

05:49.307 --> 05:52.435
<i>♪ Hank and Bobby in a Christmas truck... ♪</i>

05:52.518 --> 05:53.895
Oh, dangit!

05:53.978 --> 05:56.522
There's just no good words
that rhyme with truck.

05:56.606 --> 06:01.944
Aunt Peggy, could they be delivering
a, a snowman?

06:02.028 --> 06:05.156
I bet there's lots of words
that rhyme with snowman.

06:05.239 --> 06:06.240
Of course.

06:06.324 --> 06:10.119
Who needs a snowman
more than a widow in Arizona?

06:10.203 --> 06:12.538
Our song will be about Hank and Bobby

06:12.622 --> 06:18.002
delivering a snowman
to a woman with no man.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.672
I'm a songwriter!

06:24.967 --> 06:27.929
<i>The second-largest thermometer
in the US.</i>

06:28.012 --> 06:29.639
Do we have time to stop?

06:29.722 --> 06:31.516
Well, we have to be home by Christmas,

06:31.599 --> 06:34.185
so we can stop or we can go to a truckstop

06:34.268 --> 06:36.187
and chow down like real truckers.

06:36.270 --> 06:38.398
Chow down like real truckers!

06:38.481 --> 06:39.774
Well, all right, then.

06:39.857 --> 06:42.944
Eh, you can see the thermometer
from here anyway.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.363
"One hundred and five degrees."

06:45.446 --> 06:46.447
Wow.

06:50.034 --> 06:53.955
Hank, for god's sakes, let us out!

06:54.038 --> 06:56.374
It's so hot!

06:56.457 --> 07:00.503
No, Hank hears us,
but he's choosing to punish us.

07:00.586 --> 07:01.754
Rightly so.

07:01.838 --> 07:03.214
What's the use?

07:03.297 --> 07:04.799
At the rate I'm smoking,

07:04.882 --> 07:08.136
we only have about 30 minutes
of oxygen left anyway.

07:08.219 --> 07:10.930
Oh, man! Dang ol'... Dang... Dang ol'...

07:11.013 --> 07:11.889
Dang, man!

07:11.973 --> 07:13.307
I need a dang ol' water, man.

07:13.391 --> 07:14.600
We brought food.

07:14.684 --> 07:17.603
Maybe we can squeeze moisture out of it.

07:17.687 --> 07:18.980
Let's see.

07:19.063 --> 07:21.566
Chips, barbecue chips,

07:21.649 --> 07:24.485
vinegar flavor, hot and spicy.

07:24.569 --> 07:25.778
Saltines!

07:25.862 --> 07:27.196
No!

07:36.831 --> 07:38.166
Wow!

07:38.249 --> 07:39.959
I didn't wanna describe it to you,

07:40.042 --> 07:42.378
because, well, how could I?

07:43.421 --> 07:45.673
See, for truckers, time is money.

07:45.756 --> 07:48.926
We can't spend time waiting in a line
with the civilians.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.344
We keep to a schedule.

07:56.309 --> 07:59.187
Yup, I just rode in from Arlen, Texas,
on a straight shot.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.188
How about you?

08:00.271 --> 08:04.400
Well, I guess I'm coming in
straight from, oh, Eastern Long Island.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.111
Guess this'd be my first meal
in 40 hours or so.

08:07.195 --> 08:08.696
Yep, I hear that.

08:08.779 --> 08:09.739
Okay.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.574
So what're you boys hauling, anyway?

08:11.657 --> 08:13.868
A sofa for my grandma!

08:15.786 --> 08:18.164
Sir, this section is for truckers only.

08:18.247 --> 08:21.709
Buffs like you, takin' up space,
costs real truckers money.

08:21.792 --> 08:22.710
Go on.

08:22.793 --> 08:23.878
-Huh?
-But, Dad,

08:23.961 --> 08:26.339
I thought you said we were truckers.

08:26.422 --> 08:27.298
We are.

08:27.381 --> 08:29.050
I don't mean to spoil your fun, sir,

08:29.133 --> 08:30.468
but you're not a trucker.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.220
You're just a guy with a truck.

08:32.303 --> 08:33.429
You think I'm not a trucker?

08:33.513 --> 08:36.098
Well, I drove through El Paso in rush hour

08:36.182 --> 08:37.642
and didn't grind a gear.

08:37.725 --> 08:38.559
Look at my rig.

08:38.643 --> 08:41.812
Perfectly maintained from the back bumper
to the grill.

08:53.991 --> 08:55.451
Hank!

08:55.535 --> 08:57.286
Oh, hey, Hank.

09:00.373 --> 09:03.459
We're not gonna drink Bill
after all, okay?

09:03.543 --> 09:05.795
Waiter, table for five.

09:08.422 --> 09:11.175
Look out, hot load!

09:15.429 --> 09:16.931
We're sorry, Hank.

09:17.014 --> 09:18.766
We'll sit quietly back here

09:18.849 --> 09:21.018
if you give us a water dish to drink from.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.521
We'll be as quiet as truck-mice.

09:23.604 --> 09:24.605
Get in the cab.

09:24.689 --> 09:27.358
Fixing this hole you made
has put me off schedule.

09:27.441 --> 09:29.902
So, I'll skip my bunk time
and drive all night.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.070
Now get moving.

09:32.947 --> 09:35.866
This is the saga our song will tell.

09:36.742 --> 09:38.578
<i>Hank and Bobby find a snowman</i>

09:38.661 --> 09:40.413
<i>hitch-hiking through Arizona.</i>

09:40.496 --> 09:41.706
<i>He will melt to death</i>

09:41.789 --> 09:44.333
<i>unless he gets home
to the North Pole by Christmas.</i>

09:44.417 --> 09:46.460
<i>Hank and Bobby take him home.</i>

09:46.544 --> 09:48.713
<i>The snowman's family is so grateful,</i>

09:48.796 --> 09:51.549
<i>they invite him
to their Christmas Snowman dinner.</i>

09:52.466 --> 09:53.342
You got it?

09:53.426 --> 09:55.303
Oh, no.

09:55.886 --> 09:57.972
<i>It's okay to take a nap, Dad.</i>

09:58.055 --> 10:00.683
If we're half a day late,
Grandma won't mind.

10:00.766 --> 10:01.642
Well, I will.

10:01.726 --> 10:04.020
We've got a promise
to your mother to keep.

10:04.103 --> 10:06.522
We are getting back home
by Christmas morning.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.565
Duck...

10:07.648 --> 10:08.941
Duck...

10:09.025 --> 10:10.526
-Goose!
-What?

10:10.610 --> 10:12.486
-I'll get him, Hank.
-I'll get him.

10:14.113 --> 10:15.823
-Dangit!
-Shush it!

10:24.665 --> 10:26.959
<i>♪ And that's how the Christmas ♪</i>

10:27.043 --> 10:33.466
<i>♪ Snowman got back home! ♪</i>

10:36.719 --> 10:37.762
You don't like it.

10:37.845 --> 10:39.513
Oh, it's not that, shugs.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.766
It's just that I've got a lot
of other things on my mind.

10:41.849 --> 10:44.852
Like, I don't know where my husband is.

10:44.935 --> 10:45.978
Oh, I'm sure Dale is fine.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.521
Now, how can we fix the song?

10:47.605 --> 10:49.607
We tried your way, Aunt Peggy.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.484
Now we should do it my way!

10:51.567 --> 10:53.444
We have differences.

10:53.527 --> 10:56.530
Like when Simon versus the Garfunkel.

10:56.614 --> 10:59.617
Look how straight the lines
on the highway are.

10:59.700 --> 11:03.329
It'd be easy
to get highway hypnosis.

11:04.538 --> 11:08.250
Bill... you are getting sleepy...

11:08.334 --> 11:09.919
It's working.

11:10.002 --> 11:12.713
I'm <i>so</i> sleepy.

11:12.797 --> 11:15.424
Make... make him think
like a dang ol' chicken, man.

11:16.717 --> 11:17.885
-Hey, Dad!
-Huh?

11:17.968 --> 11:18.886
Look!

11:18.969 --> 11:20.262
I... I was awake! What?

11:20.346 --> 11:21.597
Look at the sign!

11:21.681 --> 11:23.307
"Truckstop, four miles."

11:23.391 --> 11:25.101
We can get you some coffee.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.980
Bobby, it would take too long
to tie 'em up

11:30.064 --> 11:31.816
so I'm gonna need you to get the coffee.

11:31.899 --> 11:33.401
Which line? Trucker or--

11:33.484 --> 11:34.318
Trucker.

11:35.444 --> 11:37.571
Dad, they wouldn't let me
on the trucker line

11:37.655 --> 11:39.198
for moral reasons, but...

11:42.076 --> 11:44.328
Guess playing trucker
takes a lot out of you.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.747
Least now he can tell
all the other accountants

11:46.831 --> 11:49.333
he slept at a real truckstop.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.548
Okay.

11:55.631 --> 11:57.216
Let's get a move out.

11:57.299 --> 12:00.511
Now, if we make up for the lost time
while my Dad's asleep,

12:00.594 --> 12:02.638
he'll wake up ahead of schedule.

12:02.722 --> 12:06.434
Mr. Boomhauer, are you sure
you're able to handle this vehicle?

12:06.517 --> 12:08.394
Hey, man. Dang ol' piece of cake, man.

12:08.477 --> 12:10.938
Just like riding
a dang ol' riding mower or forklift.

12:11.021 --> 12:13.649
You know, just like a dang ol' lion's
the same as kitty cat, man.

12:18.362 --> 12:20.740
<i>Fourteen-foot clearance.</i>

12:20.823 --> 12:21.657
Ha!

12:21.991 --> 12:23.409
How tall is the truck?

12:23.492 --> 12:24.493
Probably enough...

12:24.577 --> 12:25.870
I don't know. Bobby?

12:25.953 --> 12:27.037
I don't know.

12:27.121 --> 12:28.080
It's awfully big.

12:28.164 --> 12:29.832
I'd say 30 feet tall, at least.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.753
Boomhauer, get off now!

12:33.836 --> 12:35.337
-There's an exit!
-Get off now!

12:38.591 --> 12:39.800
This is the wrong way!

12:39.884 --> 12:40.801
Turn around!

12:40.885 --> 12:43.137
Hey, man. Do you see the dang ol' size
of this thing, man?

12:43.220 --> 12:45.181
Dang ol' don't talk
about "turn around" man!

12:45.264 --> 12:46.140
You can't do...

12:46.223 --> 12:48.058
Ooh, there's another exit. Take it!

12:58.277 --> 13:00.404
Well, this feels good, doesn't it?

13:12.249 --> 13:14.251
Well, Mom, that's the last of it.

13:14.335 --> 13:17.755
Hank, this is the best Christmas ever.

13:17.838 --> 13:18.672
Ready?

13:18.756 --> 13:21.550
<i>♪ Oh, say can you see ♪</i>

13:21.634 --> 13:24.512

13:24.595 --> 13:27.181

13:36.148 --> 13:38.567
What the... Where...

13:38.651 --> 13:41.612
Hank, we're having trouble
with the engine.

13:42.112 --> 13:43.405
And the clutch.

13:43.489 --> 13:47.159
Oh, and we're on top of a mountain.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.954
I think it might be a Rocky Mountain.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.630
What the hell happened?

13:59.713 --> 14:02.800
Let's just say mistakes were made.

14:02.883 --> 14:06.303
Then other larger mistakes.

14:06.387 --> 14:08.180
We're not proud of ourselves.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.598
I'm sorry, Dad.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.433
We thought if we kept driving,

14:11.517 --> 14:13.936
we could help you make
your delivery on time.

14:14.061 --> 14:16.230
We didn't even stop for a potty break.

14:16.313 --> 14:18.274
I had to use your coffee mug.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.985
Dale, get behind the line of shame.

14:22.444 --> 14:23.362
Not you, Bobby.

14:23.445 --> 14:25.072
I know you were trying to help.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.658
Hank, we're cold.

14:27.741 --> 14:29.410
Can we put our hands down?

14:29.493 --> 14:31.704
No. Okay, we're out of fuel.

14:31.787 --> 14:33.455
That part I can understand.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.958
But how did you let the battery go dead?

14:36.041 --> 14:39.461
It was dark and the headlights
made us feel so safe.

14:39.545 --> 14:42.339
Breaker 10-33, this is Top Hat.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.174
Requesting emergency...

14:44.258 --> 14:45.134
No, Bobby.

14:45.217 --> 14:46.927
I don't wanna bother real truckers

14:47.011 --> 14:49.221
with the problems of a guy who fell asleep

14:49.305 --> 14:51.724
and let his rig wind up
on top of a mountain.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.559
What are you doing, Dad?

14:54.602 --> 14:56.061
I'm gonna call Triple "A"

14:56.145 --> 14:58.230
and probably hire some movers, too.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.566
It's time to let
the professionals handle this.

15:00.649 --> 15:02.818
No! Sure we're in a hole,

15:02.943 --> 15:05.404
but real truckers
are in a hole all the time

15:05.487 --> 15:06.572
and they don't give up.

15:06.655 --> 15:08.908
They figure out a way to get through.

15:08.991 --> 15:11.744
You're not just a guy with a truck, Dad.

15:16.582 --> 15:20.002
Okay, everybody, let's check out our rig
and see what we've got.

15:20.085 --> 15:21.086
Yeah! Yeah!

15:21.170 --> 15:22.463
-All right... Oh!
-Yeah!

15:22.546 --> 15:23.923
Yeah...

15:24.006 --> 15:25.925
Uh, line suspended.

15:26.008 --> 15:27.343
-Yay!
-Yiee!

15:27.426 --> 15:29.887
And a Charlie Chaplin ceramic lamp

15:30.012 --> 15:31.847
and these opera glasses.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.557
That's what we have to work with.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.893
Hank, which would you rather
burn for warmth,

15:35.976 --> 15:37.353
the dining set

15:37.436 --> 15:40.648
or the frames of these
tasteful landscape paintings?

15:40.731 --> 15:44.234
Neither. I am getting
this load to my mom intact.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.737
Hey, man, got them
dang ol' antique lamps, man.

15:46.820 --> 15:49.073
Talk about a little kerosene
left inside, man, you know?

15:49.156 --> 15:51.408
Probably stay warm dang ol'
five minutes or so, you know?

15:51.492 --> 15:53.869
Talking about dang ol'...

15:53.953 --> 15:55.329
Good idea, Boomhauer.

15:55.412 --> 15:57.748
There might be some kerosene
still left in those lamps

15:57.831 --> 15:59.333
to keep us warm if...

15:59.416 --> 16:00.626
No, wait a minute.

16:00.709 --> 16:02.461
Bobby, hand me those opera glasses.

16:10.844 --> 16:11.845
Perfect.

16:11.929 --> 16:14.264
Now, if we can get the truck
rolling downhill,

16:14.348 --> 16:16.558
the motion will recharge the battery.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.811
And kerosene is close enough
to diesel fuel

16:18.894 --> 16:19.853
so we can burn it.

16:19.937 --> 16:21.021
I'll pop the clutch,

16:21.105 --> 16:22.690
and we can turn around in that meadow.

16:22.773 --> 16:25.234
I understood something about burning fuel.

16:25.317 --> 16:26.568
Are we going to be warm?

16:26.652 --> 16:28.904
You two are gonna get warm
working up a sweat

16:28.988 --> 16:30.781
digging out these tires. Here.

16:31.949 --> 16:33.909
Bobby, I need your help over here.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.954
And, Dale, you're, uh, at large.

16:37.037 --> 16:38.080
Yes, sir!

16:39.289 --> 16:40.124
Stroke!

16:40.207 --> 16:41.500
Stroke! Come on!

16:46.296 --> 16:47.381
Hey... Aah!

16:52.761 --> 16:55.389
Now, I won't be able to see
from the back to steer,

16:55.472 --> 16:57.016
so you fellows will have to guide me.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.600
Boomhauer, use the CB.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.728
It's gonna be a bumpy ride, so hang on.

17:00.811 --> 17:03.897
Hank, what keeps the furniture
from sliding out the door?

17:03.981 --> 17:07.192
Well, all our straps and chains
are on the road for traction.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.944
So, you do, Bill.

17:09.028 --> 17:09.945
Good luck.

17:16.660 --> 17:18.328
Okay, man, Hank, you got, like,

17:18.412 --> 17:20.289
dang ol' little ol' curve
coming up on the left.

17:20.372 --> 17:21.749
Talking about 15 or 20 degrees.

17:21.832 --> 17:23.375
Now swing it a little to the right now.

17:23.459 --> 17:24.710
Okay, now ease on to

17:24.793 --> 17:26.378
about three o'clock, man. A little bump.

17:26.503 --> 17:28.047
-Oh!
-You feel that, man? Okay, now, now...

17:28.630 --> 17:31.133
Come on straight.
Hold steady, man. Hold steady, man.

17:31.216 --> 17:32.301
Talking about a right. Now cut right.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.136
Dang ol' good job, man.

17:34.219 --> 17:37.056
Talk about just a little ol' straightaway
about 20, 30 yards now.

17:37.139 --> 17:39.892
Get a little meadow coming up
on the dang ol' left, man.

17:39.975 --> 17:41.393
Get ready, get ready now.

17:41.477 --> 17:43.228
Okay, now, cut, man. Cut, cut.

17:43.312 --> 17:44.688
Give it all you got, man!

17:45.230 --> 17:47.900
Okay, now, Hank,
hang in there, man. Quick left.

17:47.983 --> 17:49.985
Quick left! Left, left, man!

17:51.528 --> 17:52.571
It's working!

17:52.654 --> 17:54.823
It's working! It's...

18:01.455 --> 18:03.332
We only get one shot, son.

18:03.415 --> 18:04.708
Pull!

18:13.926 --> 18:15.094

-Yeah!

19:18.907 --> 19:20.534
And where's the dang ol' restroom at?

19:20.617 --> 19:23.036
Whoa. Slow it down, sweetheart.

Hey, one of you boys named Hank?

19:32.796 --> 19:35.090
Uh, we're just gonna have our coffee
and go.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.550
We don't need any trouble.

19:36.633 --> 19:38.051
I bet you don't.

19:38.135 --> 19:39.261
You had enough trouble

19:39.344 --> 19:41.221
getting down that mountain this morning.

19:41.305 --> 19:43.557
Man, we been listening on CB to you guys

19:43.640 --> 19:45.684
coming downhill on 41.

19:45.767 --> 19:47.269
Glad y'all ain't dead.

19:47.352 --> 19:49.521
What the hell you boys
sitting over there for?

19:49.605 --> 19:51.023
Come on over here.

19:55.235 --> 19:57.196
Well, all right, huh, Bobby?

19:57.279 --> 19:59.072
Yeah, all right.

19:59.156 --> 20:01.575
Getting downhill like that
took some doing.

20:01.658 --> 20:04.703
What were you gulping on,
reds, bennies, apple wackies?

20:04.786 --> 20:07.706
I don't go in
for the fancy, flavored coffees.

20:07.789 --> 20:09.416
Just regular old joe.

20:09.499 --> 20:11.460
Man, you are old school.

20:11.543 --> 20:12.920
Hey, little friend,

20:13.003 --> 20:14.546
how about taking a seat

20:14.630 --> 20:17.007
and telling me about
that run on that hill?

20:17.090 --> 20:20.135
Sir, much as I would love to get into it,

20:20.219 --> 20:21.637
we'd better get rolling.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.431
We got to finish our haul
and get home by Christmas.

20:24.514 --> 20:25.515

without your mirrors.
