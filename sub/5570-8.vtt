WEBVTT

00:01.635 --> 00:05.239
Previously on Limitless...
NZT is going to change
the entire world.

00:05.273 --> 00:07.175
I mean what I say
about wanting a partner.

00:07.208 --> 00:09.477
What are those for?
Whatever you want.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.812
NAZ: Brian's immune to the
side effects of taking NZT.

00:11.845 --> 00:12.713
We don't know how.

00:12.746 --> 00:16.150
But we certainly plan
on learning.

00:16.184 --> 00:19.053
MERRICK: We want to stack
the deck for success.

00:19.087 --> 00:21.289
We'd like to borrow your guy
for a spell.

00:21.322 --> 00:22.523
It's one big team.
We share information.

00:22.556 --> 00:24.125
A few of us know
about the pills.

00:24.158 --> 00:25.025
A few of us know about Finch.

00:25.059 --> 00:27.195
I never told the CIA
about Brian Finch.

00:27.228 --> 00:28.529
CIA hijacked one of our assets.

00:28.562 --> 00:30.298
A kid named Brian Finch.

00:30.331 --> 00:32.166
Got a permission slip
from the Bureau.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.567
Somebody put a signature down.

00:33.601 --> 00:35.669
I'm gonna figure out who
the hell authorized this,

00:35.703 --> 00:38.139
and either that person will
no longer work for the Bureau

00:38.172 --> 00:39.307
or I won't.

00:44.178 --> 00:45.379
(laughs)
Wow!

00:46.380 --> 00:48.316
(laughs)

00:48.349 --> 00:50.151
No way.

00:50.184 --> 00:51.619
This is Naz's place?

00:51.652 --> 00:52.853
Are you serious?

00:52.886 --> 00:54.021
Look at all this!

00:54.054 --> 00:56.190
(door closes)
I mean, not to sell
the boss short.

00:56.224 --> 00:57.158
I just kind of thought she...

00:57.191 --> 00:59.093
Choose your words wisely, Finch.

00:59.127 --> 01:00.861
Beachy? I was gonna
say you were beachy.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.264
I thought you were
a beach person, you know?

01:03.297 --> 01:04.832
You have that weird conch
in your office.

01:04.865 --> 01:06.100
Beach stuff.

01:06.134 --> 01:06.834
Beach... things.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.736
Why did you tell
us to come here?

01:08.769 --> 01:11.139
I'm flying to
Washington tonight.

01:11.172 --> 01:14.275
I have a meeting with Deputy
Director Rovick in the morning.

01:14.308 --> 01:17.145
I wanted to put certain
safeguards in place before I go.

01:18.146 --> 01:20.648
(sighs)

01:20.681 --> 01:22.183
The CIA took you
without my permission.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.318
Now, that is something
that can never happen again.

01:24.352 --> 01:26.354
If the meetings in D.C. go
as I expect them to,

01:26.387 --> 01:28.289
you'll have nothing
to worry about.

01:28.322 --> 01:29.190
If they don't,

01:29.223 --> 01:31.425
I can no longer guarantee
your safety

01:31.459 --> 01:32.693
at the CJC.

01:32.726 --> 01:35.463
You have to
come here immediately, yeah?

01:35.496 --> 01:37.365
Now, Rebecca knows that
this place is a fortress.

01:37.398 --> 01:38.799
It has the latest

01:38.832 --> 01:40.268
in biometric securities.

01:40.301 --> 01:41.669
Everything you need for weeks

01:41.702 --> 01:42.870
without emerging.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.809
In case you need to run.

01:48.842 --> 01:51.312
Okay, sorry, aren't we going
a little bit overboard?

01:51.345 --> 01:53.214
I mean, who would
I even need to run from?

01:53.247 --> 01:55.149
Part of the reason you
weren't immediately shipped

01:55.183 --> 01:58.352
to D.C. for study was
that doctors were concerned

01:58.386 --> 01:59.853
that your immunity
to NZT's side effects

01:59.887 --> 02:01.922
and withdrawal
came from something

02:01.955 --> 02:03.624
in the local environment.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.926
Testing proved
that it's more likely genetic.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.395
You didn't tell D.C. this.

02:07.428 --> 02:08.862
I omitted it
from your medical records.

02:08.896 --> 02:11.232
The only existing copy

02:11.265 --> 02:12.700
is on this USB drive.

02:12.733 --> 02:15.269
Well, why is it a big deal

02:15.303 --> 02:16.404
if D.C. knows?

02:16.437 --> 02:17.338
They'd move you down there.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.407
Not to a safe house,

02:19.440 --> 02:21.675
but to a cell where you would be
a test subject

02:21.709 --> 02:23.311
and doctors could do whatever

02:23.344 --> 02:24.945
to find out why you're immune.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.381
So you guard this with your life
until I get back.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.353
If I text you
the word "pomegranate,"

02:32.386 --> 02:33.887
you're to come stay here

02:33.921 --> 02:35.289
until further notice.

02:35.323 --> 02:37.658
Is that understood?
"Pomegranate"?

02:37.691 --> 02:38.859
Are we all comfortable
with "pomegranate"?
Oh, dear Lord.

02:38.892 --> 02:41.329
'Cause I think if we put our
heads together, we could come up

02:41.362 --> 02:42.963
with something a little
more... exciting.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.666
Brian, I'm gonna see you both
when I get back.

02:45.699 --> 02:47.368
All right, Naz,

02:47.401 --> 02:49.403
going to Washington D.C.,

02:49.437 --> 02:50.871
kicking some ass,
taking some names.

02:50.904 --> 02:54.342
Feel free to picture that
however you like.

02:59.480 --> 03:00.914
BRIAN: While it was fun
to imagine Naz

03:00.948 --> 03:02.650
conquering D.C. like a boss,

03:02.683 --> 03:05.386
at the end of the day,

03:05.419 --> 03:06.954
it's just a series of meetings,

03:06.987 --> 03:09.590
so it probably looks
a lot more like...

03:09.623 --> 03:12.826
this.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.299
(elevator bell dings)

03:18.332 --> 03:19.767
PAULSON:
I would've felt the same way

03:19.800 --> 03:21.435
if it happened in my shop.
Yeah.

03:21.469 --> 03:23.537
And I've always appreciated
you shooting from the hip.

03:23.571 --> 03:26.374
It's literally saved my ass
more than once.

03:26.407 --> 03:27.708
Ooh, try three.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.443
Cincinnati doesn't count.

03:29.477 --> 03:30.611
(chuckles): Oh!
That was a ricochet.

03:30.644 --> 03:34.448
Look, the point is,
sometimes there's value

03:34.482 --> 03:37.385
in using finesse.

03:37.418 --> 03:39.420
Cincinnati, Kenny.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.392
Morning, Deputy Director.

03:44.425 --> 03:45.959
Thank you.

03:47.428 --> 03:49.730
Please.
Thank you.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.632
Good morning, everyone.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.434
SAC Pouran,
thanks for coming down

03:53.467 --> 03:54.602
from New York.

03:54.635 --> 03:58.472
So, I would like to start
with a review of the situation.

03:58.506 --> 04:00.274
NAZ:
The CIA's abduction

04:00.308 --> 04:01.475
of Brian Finch put

04:01.509 --> 04:02.610
an untrained consultant,

04:02.643 --> 04:04.778
whom I assured protection,

04:04.812 --> 04:06.714
in mortal danger
without so much as an e-mail

04:06.747 --> 04:08.749
clearing the op with me first.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.484
That is entirely unacceptable.

04:10.518 --> 04:12.486
Or we could just dive in.

04:12.520 --> 04:13.854
SAC Pouran is reasonably upset.

04:13.887 --> 04:16.424
The use of an asset
without approval

04:16.457 --> 04:19.527
undermines her ability
to lead the CJC.

04:19.560 --> 04:20.594
"Undermines" is
an understatement.

04:20.628 --> 04:21.895
I can no longer lead
the division

04:21.929 --> 04:23.397
unless certain assurances
are put into place.

04:23.431 --> 04:25.533
I would like to
know the names

04:25.566 --> 04:27.301
of everyone on the Bureau
that signed off

04:27.335 --> 04:30.438
on Brian Finch's involvement
in this rogue CIA operation.

04:30.471 --> 04:32.673
I would like them
suspended pending review.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.508
And I expect a copy

04:34.542 --> 04:37.545
of the signed memo
authorizing Brian's involvement.

04:37.578 --> 04:39.447
This memo does not exist.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.881
Not from me

04:40.914 --> 04:42.650
or from any of my agents.

04:42.683 --> 04:45.519
I just found out
about this yesterday.

04:45.553 --> 04:47.655
If no one is held responsible,

04:47.688 --> 04:50.023
I have no other choice
but to resign.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.792
There's no need to bluff, Naz.

04:51.825 --> 04:53.561
But if I do resign,
Catherine,

04:53.594 --> 04:55.529
I will have plenty of time
to expose the fact

04:55.563 --> 04:57.064
that the CIA performed

04:57.097 --> 04:59.400
a black operation
on American soil,

04:59.433 --> 05:01.469
and that memo that you
say does not exist,

05:01.502 --> 05:03.504
it will show up
at the DOJ audit.

05:03.537 --> 05:04.505
PAULSON:
Um, what...

05:04.538 --> 05:07.975
Let's take this down to, say,
um, DEFCON 3?

05:09.042 --> 05:10.744
Knowing our assets
are protected

05:10.778 --> 05:13.581
is a cornerstone of
counterintelligence operations.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.883
This op went against everything

05:15.916 --> 05:17.751
we fight for in the Bureau.

05:17.785 --> 05:21.922
If someone did sanction it,

05:21.955 --> 05:23.691
we'll find out who.

05:23.724 --> 05:26.627
I'll have my office personally
handle the investigation.

05:31.599 --> 05:32.666
Can I ask a question?

05:32.700 --> 05:33.501
Yeah.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.503
How'd you get stuck
with this job?

05:35.536 --> 05:37.037
Well, I, uh,

05:37.070 --> 05:38.506
I got placed
in the Anchorage field office

05:38.539 --> 05:39.773
out of Quantico.

05:39.807 --> 05:41.041
Alaska?

05:41.074 --> 05:42.943
What? Why?

05:42.976 --> 05:44.445
Were you bottom
of your class?

05:44.478 --> 05:47.114
(sighs) My SAC found me asleep
on a stakeout.

05:47.147 --> 05:48.115
Ooh.

05:48.148 --> 05:50.651
It's dark all the time there.

05:54.655 --> 05:55.823
All right.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.425
Ready for live ammunition?

05:57.458 --> 06:00.360
Mm-hmm.

06:01.562 --> 06:02.563
Okay.

06:10.804 --> 06:11.839
Naz is back.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.607
She got D.C. to agree
to a formal investigation.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.909
Like a boss.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.445
(candy rattling)

06:17.478 --> 06:18.946
Thank you, Mr....

06:18.979 --> 06:20.614
Save the red ones.
Okay.

06:21.649 --> 06:22.783
What the hell is going on?

06:26.086 --> 06:27.421
Naz, what happened?

06:27.455 --> 06:28.689
Don't respond.

06:29.623 --> 06:30.891
Back away.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.793
SAC Pouran is being
detained for questioning.

06:34.695 --> 06:36.564
MAN:
Agent Harris, Mr. Finch.

06:36.597 --> 06:37.698
(elevator bell dings)

06:37.731 --> 06:38.699
Pleasure to meet you both.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.133
I hear great things,

06:40.167 --> 06:41.802
excited to be working...
Sorry, what?

06:41.835 --> 06:43.704
ADIC Grady Johnson.
I'll be overseeing things here,

06:43.737 --> 06:45.706
just until the charges
against your boss

06:45.739 --> 06:47.741
are cleared up.
What charges?

06:47.775 --> 06:49.677
Agent Boyle, I want
to speak with you privately.

06:49.710 --> 06:50.844
But you two,

06:50.878 --> 06:53.514
why don't you join me
in my office.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.148
We have a,
we have a lot to talk about.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.245
You took our SAC
out of here in cuffs,

07:25.278 --> 07:27.548
and you won't even tell us
what she's charged with?

07:27.581 --> 07:28.649
All I can tell you is that

07:28.682 --> 07:31.519
Nasreen Pouran is being accused
of serious violations

07:31.552 --> 07:33.621
of national security.

07:33.654 --> 07:36.557
The investigation
is classified.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.258
Well, we'll just be in touch
with her lawyer, then.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.993
SAC Pouran is being held

07:40.027 --> 07:41.261
under the National Defense

07:41.294 --> 07:42.295
Authorization Act.

07:42.329 --> 07:46.266
She has no access
to an attorney at this time.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.269
I'll be leading a review
of operations here

07:49.302 --> 07:51.539
while that's underway.

07:51.572 --> 07:54.708
I know that sounds ominous,
but I'm here to help.

07:54.742 --> 07:58.211
BRIAN: Assistant Director
in Charge Grady Johnson.

07:58.245 --> 07:59.980
Let's start with the obvious,
shall we?

08:00.013 --> 08:02.616
He's actually five-foot-four
without the platform shoes,

08:02.650 --> 08:05.753
he smiles with his face
but not with his eyes,

08:05.786 --> 08:08.255
upgrades to the latest phone
the second it comes out,

08:08.288 --> 08:10.524
your basic hatchet man,

08:10.558 --> 08:12.560
here to do someone else's
dirty work.

08:12.593 --> 08:13.627
You.

08:13.661 --> 08:15.262
Hmm?

08:15.295 --> 08:16.564
Are you listening?

08:16.597 --> 08:18.265
Kind of.

08:18.298 --> 08:18.999
One sec.

08:19.032 --> 08:21.068
(rewinding noise)

08:21.101 --> 08:23.571
...cutting off your supply
of NZT until further notice.

08:23.604 --> 08:24.772
(rewinding)

08:24.805 --> 08:28.208
All, uh, consulting duties
temporarily suspended will be...

08:28.241 --> 08:30.077
You must remain
in the safe house

08:30.110 --> 08:31.679
pending further review.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.547
You're cutting off my NZT

08:33.581 --> 08:34.948
and you're sending me
to the safe house.

08:34.982 --> 08:36.316
(snaps)
Ah, good, you're up to speed.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.651
Yeah, this is the new normal.

08:37.685 --> 08:38.852
It'll take
some adjusting,

08:38.886 --> 08:42.590
but we'll get
this department running

08:42.623 --> 08:43.557
right.

08:45.158 --> 08:46.627
Uh, Johnson?

08:46.660 --> 08:47.795
None of us know why,

08:47.828 --> 08:49.963
but that conch
is really special to Naz.

08:49.997 --> 08:53.133
I know you're getting settled
in and stuff, so do your thing,

08:53.166 --> 08:54.868
but if you don't mind, just
leave that conch where it is.

08:54.902 --> 08:57.204
Oh, no, I-I'll take care
of the conch.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.205
Great.
Yeah.

08:58.238 --> 08:59.840
Thanks.
Okay.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.010
(door opens)

09:03.977 --> 09:05.646
(sighs)

09:05.679 --> 09:07.915
He said she's being held
under the NDAA.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.850
That's a clause that allows
for indefinite detention

09:09.883 --> 09:11.852
of an American citizen
without due process,

09:11.885 --> 09:13.721
so she has no lawyer,
she's probably being held

09:13.754 --> 09:14.822
at a military base.

09:14.855 --> 09:17.224
I'm gonna call D.C.,
see if I can get some answers.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.126
Or we can just use this.

09:19.159 --> 09:22.195
Now, at first, Johnson's just
gonna assume he lost it,

09:22.229 --> 09:23.931
so let's see
what we can find out

09:23.964 --> 09:25.065
before he shuts it down.

09:25.098 --> 09:26.600
Fine, but not here.

09:26.634 --> 09:27.901
You need to lie low.

09:27.935 --> 09:30.370
You know Naz told me to go
to the safe house.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.905
She did? When?
Yeah.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.610
I can read lips, remember?

09:36.644 --> 09:37.745
Right.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.046
Fine, let's go.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.681
Okay, one problem.

09:40.714 --> 09:43.350
I think I left my emergency
packet back at my place.

09:43.383 --> 09:44.351
(elevator bell dings)

09:44.384 --> 09:46.720
Brian, if someone gives you
an emergency packet,

09:46.754 --> 09:47.587
because your place has
been compromised, you...

09:47.621 --> 09:49.289
BOTH:
...don't leave it in the place

09:49.322 --> 09:50.891
that's been compromised.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.060
Jinx.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.898
The FBI can ping
that phone's location, Brian.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.700
Yeah, just to the nearest tower,
though.

09:59.733 --> 10:00.834
It doesn't prove anything.

10:00.868 --> 10:02.202
And besides,

10:02.235 --> 10:03.804
that DIC is way too egotistical

10:03.837 --> 10:05.272
to have somebody ping
his cell phone.

10:05.305 --> 10:06.373
Are you kidding me?

10:06.406 --> 10:08.842
It's not DIC. It's ADIC.

10:08.876 --> 10:09.977
It's...

10:10.010 --> 10:11.178
A-D-I-C.

10:11.211 --> 10:12.813
ADIC, I got it.

10:12.846 --> 10:13.714
(chuckles)

10:13.747 --> 10:15.248
Okay, let's see.

10:15.282 --> 10:18.151
Password. I've got five shots
at this, tops.

10:18.185 --> 10:20.287
Gun guy, of course.

10:20.320 --> 10:24.191
Huh, the FBI issues Glocks,
not .357s.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.726
So let's see.

10:25.759 --> 10:29.797
0.357...

10:29.830 --> 10:30.964
Hey, I got it in one try!

10:30.998 --> 10:32.766
Uh, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.101
Oh, here we go.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.068
Here's a chain

10:35.102 --> 10:37.270
between Johnson
and Deputy Director Rovick.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.039
Oh, man.

10:39.072 --> 10:41.241
Naz is being held
for suspicion of treason.

10:41.274 --> 10:42.442
What?

10:42.475 --> 10:45.713
They say she made payments
to some guy named Felix Durmaz.

10:45.746 --> 10:48.048
He's on
the terrorist watch list.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.216
They think he funnels money
to jihadis.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.118
There's no way that's true.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.253
She does keep a lot of secrets.

10:53.286 --> 10:55.789
She just went down to D.C.
to save your ass.

10:55.823 --> 10:57.190
She got thrown into
a hole for it.

10:57.224 --> 10:58.726
She is being framed.

10:58.759 --> 11:01.028
And we are gonna help her.

11:01.061 --> 11:03.196
Hey, all right.

11:03.230 --> 11:05.398
Oh, uh, will you
do me a favor?

11:05.432 --> 11:07.234
Can you water
my bonsai plant?

11:07.267 --> 11:08.736
It's on the table.

11:08.769 --> 11:09.837
It's special to me.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.972
I don't know how
long we'll be gone.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.941
Truth-- I've had
that packet Naz gave me

11:13.974 --> 11:15.776
in my pocket all day.

11:15.809 --> 11:16.777
The real reason I needed
to come back here

11:16.810 --> 11:19.479
was to get the NZT
Edward Morra gave me.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.715
My supply's cut off,
so if we're gonna help Naz,

11:21.749 --> 11:24.785
I need these.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.086
REBECCA:
What are you doing?

11:28.055 --> 11:30.157
You're not really gonna try
to bring your music collection

11:30.190 --> 11:31.859
in the largest format possible,
are you?

11:36.063 --> 11:37.364
(phone rings)

11:37.397 --> 11:40.333
Oh, that's Johnson's phone.

11:40.367 --> 11:43.170
It's from
Deputy Director Rovick.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.005
They said that they
looked through Naz's phone.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.875
And Naz texted someone
just before she was arrested.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.342
But they can't trace the number;
it was a burner phone.

11:49.376 --> 11:50.878
What did she text?

11:50.911 --> 11:52.312
"Pomegranate."

11:52.345 --> 11:55.949
So she sent the emergency signal
to someone else.

11:55.983 --> 11:57.885
Is it wrong that I feel
less special now?

11:59.086 --> 12:00.754
One sec, I want to respond.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.990
What are you doing?

12:37.024 --> 12:38.125
Nothing.
Let's go.

12:38.158 --> 12:39.993
Hey, isn't that water
for the plant?

12:40.027 --> 12:41.795
It's a fake bonsai, Brian.

12:41.829 --> 12:43.096
Oh.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.999
Well, I guess you don't
need to water it, then.

12:48.435 --> 12:49.436
(mouthing)

12:52.873 --> 12:54.307
Spellman Boyle.

12:54.341 --> 12:56.576
After the school?

12:56.609 --> 12:57.945
Yes, sir.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.412
My great-grandmother
went to Spellman.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.581
She was the first one
in the family to go to college.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.584
(laughs):
She would be proud of you.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.454
Master's degree,
decorated Army Ranger.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.489
Worked your way up through
the Criminal Division

13:09.522 --> 13:11.391
until you got promoted
into the CJC.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.493
So, so how's it been, hmm?

13:13.526 --> 13:14.928
You know, working here?

13:14.962 --> 13:17.330
It's fantastic, sir.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.099
Hey, come on.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.936
That complaint you filed
with the local ADIC

13:22.970 --> 13:24.972
a few months back, uh:

13:25.005 --> 13:27.975
"An illegal
and unsanctioned drug

13:28.008 --> 13:30.610
"administered
to an untrained consultant

13:30.643 --> 13:33.313
could lead
to a national scandal."

13:33.346 --> 13:36.283
These, these are
your words, right?

13:36.316 --> 13:38.418
They are.

13:38.451 --> 13:40.453
I knew D.C. was aware of Finch,

13:40.487 --> 13:41.989
but it's different here
on the ground.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.456
I thought the leadership
should know.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.625
Yeah, there's a rather
large contingent that thinks

13:45.658 --> 13:46.927
you might be the only

13:46.960 --> 13:50.030
sane person in this department.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.866
Yeah, well, Finch has
done a lot of good things

13:52.900 --> 13:54.301
since he's been here, sir.

13:54.334 --> 13:57.237
Oh, and no, and I want to,
I want to know about that.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.972
Would-would you write me

13:59.006 --> 14:00.307
a-a report

14:00.340 --> 14:03.010
on all things Brian Finch?

14:03.043 --> 14:06.046
There are big changes coming,
Spellman.

14:06.079 --> 14:08.381
Yes, sir.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.990
(beeping)

14:19.492 --> 14:21.194
Hey, do you see that?

14:21.228 --> 14:22.996
The alarm's been disabled.

14:28.001 --> 14:30.103
Hey!

14:30.137 --> 14:32.439
Ava.

14:32.472 --> 14:33.941
Rebecca.

14:36.076 --> 14:38.078
You're Naz's daughter.

14:38.111 --> 14:39.612
What are you doing here?

14:39.646 --> 14:40.981
Aren't you at grad school?

14:41.014 --> 14:42.215
I'm home for the week.

14:42.249 --> 14:43.450
You're the one that Naz texted.

14:43.483 --> 14:44.918
Why did she tell you
to come here?

14:44.952 --> 14:46.319
Where is she?

14:46.353 --> 14:49.289
She's being detained
for treason.

14:49.322 --> 14:50.690
They're saying that
she transferred funds

14:50.723 --> 14:52.960
to someone who's
on a terrorist watch list.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.227
We know she's innocent.
You're wrong.

14:54.261 --> 14:57.197
She gave Felix Durmaz
$3 million.

14:58.198 --> 15:01.001
She did everything
they said she did.

15:01.034 --> 15:02.936
My mom's not innocent.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.212
WOMAN:
It's gorgeous here, Ava.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.314
I wish you were here with me.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.349
That's my cousin.

15:16.383 --> 15:17.584
Mitra.

15:17.617 --> 15:20.387
She sent me these videos
on her Peace Corps trip.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.455
And this is the last one I got.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.224
They've been chasing
our boat since sundown!

15:24.257 --> 15:26.226
I think they're
about to board us!

15:26.259 --> 15:27.494
Please send help!

15:27.527 --> 15:29.462
She's being held for ransom?

15:29.496 --> 15:31.698
Her crew was overtaken
by Indonesian pirates

15:31.731 --> 15:34.401
somewhere
in the South China Sea.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.969
That's why Naz gave money
to Felix Durmaz.

15:36.003 --> 15:37.670
He's the go-between.

15:37.704 --> 15:39.372
He's negotiating her freedom.

15:39.406 --> 15:41.274
And I guess that's
why my mom sent me here--

15:41.308 --> 15:43.310
to wait on his call.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.412
Why didn't Naz
just go through the FBI?

15:45.445 --> 15:46.279
She didn't want
to get them involved.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.615
Too many rescue missions
have gone badly.

15:48.648 --> 15:51.151
BRIAN: So, Naz used her sources
to find a broker--

15:51.184 --> 15:54.154
a shady underworld type used
to handling these things.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.523
Of course, Felix is on
every terrorist watch list

15:56.556 --> 15:58.291
for funneling money
to the kinds of people

15:58.325 --> 16:01.061
who see kidnapping
as a business.

16:01.094 --> 16:04.264
Naz's enemies in D.C.
tracked the situation.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.499
Once she made her threat,

16:06.533 --> 16:08.035
they followed
the money trail to Felix,

16:08.068 --> 16:09.236
and here we are.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.171
Wait, once you get
your cousin back,

16:11.204 --> 16:13.040
can't we prove
the money Naz paid

16:13.073 --> 16:15.108
wasn't used to help terrorists?

16:15.142 --> 16:16.343
Or if we got
Felix to talk...

16:16.376 --> 16:18.745
Guys like that don't talk.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.647
And I don't know
how to reach him.

16:20.680 --> 16:21.748
He contacts my mom

16:21.781 --> 16:24.617
over the secured network here,
so...

16:24.651 --> 16:27.020
there's nothing to do but wait.

16:27.054 --> 16:29.489
What are you
thinking about?

16:29.522 --> 16:31.324
Trying to figure out
if there's a way

16:31.358 --> 16:34.127
that this ends with me
sword-fighting pirates.

16:37.097 --> 16:39.132
Naz is guilty, she is.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.334
I mean, she gave that money
to Felix Durmaz,

16:41.368 --> 16:44.137
and her enemies
are gonna hang her for it.

16:44.171 --> 16:45.805
I know.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.607
You know what we need to do,
we need to find that memo

16:47.640 --> 16:50.410
that proves that the FBI
loaned me to the CIA.

16:50.443 --> 16:53.613
We got a permission
slip from the Bureau.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.248
So you're thinking
what I'm thinking.

16:55.282 --> 16:57.084
We find the ammo
and go right for 'em.

16:57.117 --> 16:59.519
Yeah, but we still don't even
know who's in charge of this.

16:59.552 --> 17:02.055
ADIC Johnson's definitely not
calling the shots.

17:02.089 --> 17:04.291
But we looked through his phone
and nothing told us who is.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.126
How are we supposed
to find this memo

17:06.159 --> 17:07.394
if we don't know
who's hiding it?

17:07.427 --> 17:09.696
We could offer them bait.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.431
The medical records.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.366
Have you made contact with her?

17:13.400 --> 17:14.567
PAULSON:
I'm working on it.

17:14.601 --> 17:16.503
But it seems someone's
stonewalling me.

17:16.536 --> 17:17.737
Who?
I don't know.

17:17.770 --> 17:19.372
Well, that's
the million-dollar question.

17:19.406 --> 17:20.473
What about you?

17:20.507 --> 17:21.508
Found anything?

17:21.541 --> 17:22.642
Nothing to speak of.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.611
Well, I'm using
some of my contacts

17:24.644 --> 17:26.313
in the House to pull rank.

17:26.346 --> 17:28.181
I'll call you as soon
as I know anything.

17:28.215 --> 17:29.316
Thank you.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.153
Where have you been?

17:33.186 --> 17:34.254
Do you really
want to know?

17:34.287 --> 17:35.822
No.

17:35.855 --> 17:38.391
Johnson's been asking.

17:38.425 --> 17:40.093
Someone stole
Johnson's cell phone.

17:40.127 --> 17:42.329
Sent out a bunch
of text messages

17:42.362 --> 17:43.796
saying he has a micropenis.

17:43.830 --> 17:46.466
Sound like
someone we know?

17:46.499 --> 17:49.402
Well, I'm not saying

17:49.436 --> 17:51.838
he's the most mature person
in the world.

17:51.871 --> 17:55.708
Or your average third grade
classroom for that matter.

17:55.742 --> 17:58.178
But he is committed
to getting Naz back.

17:58.211 --> 17:59.812
We need you to talk
to Johnson.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.848
We need proof

18:01.881 --> 18:03.183
that someone in the FBI
signed off

18:03.216 --> 18:06.253
on abducting Brian
for that black op.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.855
Consider this your carrot.

18:08.888 --> 18:11.324
Tell Johnson it contains
Brian's complete medical file.

18:11.358 --> 18:12.692
Does it?

18:12.725 --> 18:14.327
Ish.

18:15.395 --> 18:16.729
You just need
to convince Johnson

18:16.763 --> 18:18.331
to let you take it to D.C.

18:19.399 --> 18:20.800
Whoever he takes you to,

18:20.833 --> 18:21.901
whoever wants to know
about Brian,

18:21.934 --> 18:24.237
that's the one that has
the proof about the CIA op.

18:24.271 --> 18:25.738
Johnson is never
gonna buy it.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.840
And even if he did,
what makes you assume

18:27.874 --> 18:30.377
that I would be
on board with this?

18:30.410 --> 18:34.481
Because I know what
the CJC means to you.

18:34.514 --> 18:37.284
And I know you'd do
anything to save it.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.628
(siren wailing in distance)

18:48.661 --> 18:50.863
Hey.

18:50.897 --> 18:53.333
You okay?

18:53.366 --> 18:56.236
You know, I was
supposed to meet Mitra.

18:56.269 --> 18:58.805
And at the last minute,
my mom told me not to go.

18:58.838 --> 19:01.474
She said it was
too dangerous.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.776
I was so pissed at her,

19:03.810 --> 19:06.246
but she was right.

19:06.279 --> 19:08.848
I'm such a complete screwup.

19:08.881 --> 19:11.284
You know, you can't
blame yourself for that.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.753
You wouldn't understand.

19:13.786 --> 19:16.656
Oh, about being a screwup?

19:16.689 --> 19:19.226
Oh, no.
(chuckles)

19:19.259 --> 19:21.294
I got a pretty good
handle on that.

19:21.328 --> 19:22.829
But you seem so together.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.731
How did you get
into the FBI?

19:24.764 --> 19:26.499
It's a fairly
recent development.

19:26.533 --> 19:27.800
And I'm not technically...

19:27.834 --> 19:29.969
You know what,
it's a long story.

19:30.002 --> 19:34.407
Point is, I think my dad
and your mom are a lot alike.

19:34.441 --> 19:36.709
It's like we're gonna end up
disappointing them anyway,

19:36.743 --> 19:40.847
so why not just jump in
and make it your choice?

19:40.880 --> 19:43.816
(beeping)

19:44.984 --> 19:47.186
It's him!

19:49.989 --> 19:51.491
You must be Ava.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.493
You look like your mother.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.362
She warned me that she
may become unavailable,

19:55.395 --> 19:58.231
and if that happened,
I was to contact you this way.

19:58.265 --> 19:59.299
Who are you?

19:59.332 --> 20:00.233
He's a friend.
It's okay.

20:00.267 --> 20:02.302
Please tell me you got
some information.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.304
I have bad news, I'm afraid.

20:04.337 --> 20:07.640
I negotiated an agreement
with the G.A.M. pirate crew.

20:07.674 --> 20:09.509
But before their ship
went into port

20:09.542 --> 20:11.244
to make the exchange,
they were overtaken.

20:11.278 --> 20:12.879
What do you mean "overtaken"?

20:12.912 --> 20:14.514
The South China Sea
is a very dangerous place.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.416
A competing band
of pirates attacked,

20:16.449 --> 20:18.918
taking all of their valuables,

20:18.951 --> 20:20.287
including your cousin.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.354
What, seriously?

20:21.388 --> 20:23.423
The pirates were pirated?

20:23.456 --> 20:24.957
It happens.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.025
None of the men I was
negotiating with survived.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.894
Oh, my God.

20:27.927 --> 20:30.497
(knocking, indistinct chatter)

20:30.530 --> 20:32.632
I'll let you know the second
I have anything new.

20:32.665 --> 20:33.700
I must go.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.536
Mitra's gonna die.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.638
My mom can't help her.

20:38.671 --> 20:39.806
No, hey, hey, hey,
listen to me!

20:39.839 --> 20:41.007
We're gonna get her back, okay?

20:41.040 --> 20:42.542
Mitra and your mom.
How?!

20:42.575 --> 20:43.943
We don't know where either
of them have been taken.

20:43.976 --> 20:45.412
Look, we're working
on the Naz situation.

20:45.445 --> 20:46.613
And as for finding Mitra?

20:46.646 --> 20:48.648
Let's just say

20:48.681 --> 20:50.317
I, uh, have

20:50.350 --> 20:53.453
a very particular set of skills.

20:54.821 --> 20:57.524
(door closes)

20:59.326 --> 21:01.528
Thank you, no, I've got it.

21:01.561 --> 21:02.529
Oh, great, looks like
you got everything.

21:02.562 --> 21:04.431
Yeah, thanks
for the help.

21:04.464 --> 21:06.933
Oh, did you need a hand?

21:06.966 --> 21:08.301
A ham radio,

21:08.335 --> 21:10.770
guides on Southeast
Asian languages,

21:10.803 --> 21:13.540
and all of the FBI files
on pirates in that region.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.074
Great.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.676
What's the deal?

21:16.709 --> 21:18.378
Ava's cousin got taken
by a second group of pirates.

21:18.411 --> 21:20.513
We don't know who they are.
We don't know where they are.

21:20.547 --> 21:22.615
And we don't know what they're
planning on doing with Mitra.

21:22.649 --> 21:24.517
Brian, your supply
of NZT was cut off.

21:24.551 --> 21:27.086
The dispensary
is on lockdown.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.555
So how do you expect to learn
a bunch of languages

21:28.588 --> 21:29.822
and also find a group of people

21:29.856 --> 21:31.958
whose entire
existence relies

21:31.991 --> 21:34.861
on them being hidden
without NZT?

21:34.894 --> 21:35.928
That is an excellent question.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.597
And before I answer it,
I would like to remind you

21:37.630 --> 21:39.799
that this is all
out of service

21:39.832 --> 21:41.634
to saving a girl's life.

21:41.668 --> 21:43.536
So be gentle.

21:44.704 --> 21:46.673
I might have
a few extra NZT pills.

21:46.706 --> 21:48.608
My own stash,

21:48.641 --> 21:49.876
I guess you could call it.

21:49.909 --> 21:50.543
What?

21:54.614 --> 21:56.716
Where did you get those?

22:04.457 --> 22:06.926
Seriously, Brian,
where did you get those?

22:06.959 --> 22:09.128
Listen, we can absolutely
talk about this,

22:09.161 --> 22:11.564
all night long
if you want to,

22:11.598 --> 22:15.101
or we could try to save Mitra
from being murdered by pirates.

22:15.134 --> 22:17.404
Fine.

22:17.437 --> 22:19.439
We are gonna talk
about this later.

22:22.775 --> 22:24.577
(sighs)

22:27.647 --> 22:29.416
BRIAN:
Okay.

22:29.449 --> 22:31.584
We know Mitra is somewhere
in the South China Sea.

22:31.618 --> 22:32.585
But since we don't know
who's holding her

22:32.619 --> 22:33.920
or how to talk to them,

22:33.953 --> 22:35.588
it's time to learn
some languages.

22:35.622 --> 22:37.624
(overlapping words
in several languages play)

22:42.094 --> 22:44.063
Like... all the languages
in the South China Sea.

22:44.096 --> 22:46.566
*

23:03.450 --> 23:05.418
(men speaking foreign language)

23:05.452 --> 23:07.153
It's Vietnamese.

23:07.186 --> 23:09.989
(speaking Vietnamese)

23:17.196 --> 23:19.999
So, okay. Mitra is being held
by new pirates,

23:20.032 --> 23:22.001
bigger and badder than
the last pirates who had her.

23:22.034 --> 23:23.536
But we don't know who they are.

23:23.570 --> 23:25.004
She's stuck
in international waters

23:25.037 --> 23:27.073
where we have no contact
and no jurisdiction.

23:27.106 --> 23:29.642
But we do have a ham radio.

23:29.676 --> 23:32.545
And seafarers, maritime law
enforcers and locals

23:32.579 --> 23:33.680
still use
the radio wave frequencies

23:33.713 --> 23:34.814
to communicate with each other.

23:34.847 --> 23:36.649
If we can find
the right frequency,

23:36.683 --> 23:39.151
we just might be able
to find out who has Mitra.

23:39.185 --> 23:40.887
If you remove human life
from the equation,

23:40.920 --> 23:42.855
it's actually quite
a stimulating problem.

23:42.889 --> 23:43.856
*

23:43.890 --> 23:45.892
(Brian speaking Vietnamese)

23:45.925 --> 23:48.094
(man speaks Vietnamese)

23:48.127 --> 23:50.863
No pirates here.
That's good, though.

23:50.897 --> 23:52.899
That's really, really good.
We've got somebody, okay?
So keep doing this

23:52.932 --> 23:54.667
over and over and over
until we get somebody else.

23:54.701 --> 23:57.770
Brian... I don't know how
you're doing all of this,

23:57.804 --> 23:59.171
but it means so much.

23:59.205 --> 24:02.942
And I know it would to my mom,
too, so thank you.

24:02.975 --> 24:04.511
Hey.

24:06.145 --> 24:07.780
We're gonna find her, okay?

24:07.814 --> 24:09.482
Don't worry.

24:09.516 --> 24:11.518
(speaks Vietnamese)

24:12.952 --> 24:14.954
(young man speaking Indonesian)

24:18.124 --> 24:20.126
(speaks Indonesian)

24:23.029 --> 24:25.064
Who are you?

24:25.097 --> 24:26.065
Uh...

24:26.098 --> 24:27.133
sorry, I didn't copy.

24:27.166 --> 24:28.601
Can you repeat?

24:28.635 --> 24:29.569
Who are you?

24:29.602 --> 24:32.238
Why do you want to know
about American girl?

24:34.306 --> 24:35.942
We're with the FBI.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.910
We'd like to negotiate with
the pirates who are holding her,

24:37.944 --> 24:39.478
but we need to know
who they are.

24:44.717 --> 24:46.185
Hello, FBI.

24:46.218 --> 24:48.187
My name is Pradeep.

24:48.220 --> 24:49.155
I know your pirates.

24:49.188 --> 24:50.623
Well, how do you know them?

24:50.657 --> 24:51.858
I track them
on my Tumblr.

24:51.891 --> 24:52.992
I talk with
locals here.

24:53.025 --> 24:54.193
Pirates don't know
who I am,

24:54.226 --> 24:55.227
so it's all good.

24:55.261 --> 24:57.296
And you know these pirates
have an American woman?

24:57.329 --> 24:59.265
I can tell you

24:59.298 --> 25:01.300
if you, FBI,
tweet my page.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.603
So I get American fans.
Then, I will have

25:03.636 --> 25:04.871
top pirate page.

25:04.904 --> 25:06.873
Uh... (laughs)

25:06.906 --> 25:08.708
How do we know you're
telling the truth, Pradeep?

25:08.741 --> 25:11.277
G.A.M.,
Indonesian pirates,

25:11.310 --> 25:12.545
had your lady first.

25:12.579 --> 25:13.546
See? I know.

25:13.580 --> 25:15.181
Will you tweet me?

25:15.214 --> 25:16.549
My name: SeaSwagler.

25:16.583 --> 25:18.184
Can you do that?
Yeah, can we do that?

25:18.217 --> 25:19.619
Yeah, I'll text Darryl in Cyber.

25:19.652 --> 25:20.953
He'll take
care of it.
All right, little buddy.

25:20.987 --> 25:22.622
Request is being granted
right now.

25:22.655 --> 25:23.322
Now tell us
what you know.

25:23.355 --> 25:24.323
G.A.M. and other pirates

25:24.356 --> 25:25.324
lose their bounty

25:25.357 --> 25:26.759
to a big ship.

25:26.793 --> 25:28.595
The Wong Sa.

25:28.628 --> 25:29.729
Wong Sa was sent from Malaysia.

25:29.762 --> 25:31.263
Sent to stop pirates.

25:31.297 --> 25:32.999
But it turned
pirate, too.

25:33.032 --> 25:34.667
Now, they hunt
other pirates,

25:34.701 --> 25:35.635
stealing their goods.

25:35.668 --> 25:38.671
G.A.M. is always
losing to the Wong Sa.

25:38.705 --> 25:40.339
That must be where Mitra is.
Right?

25:40.372 --> 25:41.741
Thanks, Pradeep.

25:41.774 --> 25:42.742
No worries.

25:42.775 --> 25:43.743
Be happy.

25:43.776 --> 25:45.111
Oh, my God.

25:45.144 --> 25:46.112
Ha-ha!

25:46.145 --> 25:47.213
We have a ship!

25:47.246 --> 25:48.214
It's a start.

25:48.247 --> 25:50.683
(quick knock, door opens)

25:50.717 --> 25:51.684
Agent Boyle.

25:51.718 --> 25:52.919
What do you got?

25:52.952 --> 25:55.755
Found anything
worth reporting?

25:55.788 --> 25:58.290
Sir, I did, actually.

25:58.324 --> 26:01.060
You see, I've always prided
myself on good communication

26:01.093 --> 26:03.029
and divisional transparency,

26:03.062 --> 26:06.633
so you can imagine
I wasn't happy

26:06.666 --> 26:08.267
when I learned information
had been omitted

26:08.300 --> 26:10.770
from Brian Finch's
medical records.

26:10.803 --> 26:11.804
Really?

26:13.673 --> 26:15.842
Look, uh...

26:15.875 --> 26:18.911
what I'm about
to tell you, um...

26:20.747 --> 26:22.982
I could be risking my job
for this conversation.

26:23.015 --> 26:24.851
Well, Agent Boyle,

26:24.884 --> 26:26.819
I can protect you.

26:28.054 --> 26:29.455
Yeah.

26:33.325 --> 26:36.128
The truth is...

26:36.162 --> 26:37.964
Rebecca gave me a thumb drive,

26:37.997 --> 26:39.699
wanted me to tell you

26:39.732 --> 26:42.234
it contained
Finch's complete records.

26:42.268 --> 26:44.336
But she and Brian falsified it.

26:44.370 --> 26:46.072
Which got me thinking...

26:46.105 --> 26:49.942
there must be some real
records worth finding.

26:49.976 --> 26:53.279
Brian Finch's
complete medical history,

26:53.312 --> 26:56.883
blood work and his
immunity studies.

26:56.916 --> 26:59.351
It's pretty clear why Naz lied
to all of us about this.

26:59.385 --> 27:02.288
This is a game-changer,
Agent Boyle.

27:02.321 --> 27:03.923
There are certain
people in D.C.

27:03.956 --> 27:06.926
who will be...
quite pleased.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.394
Which is why I would like

27:08.427 --> 27:09.829
to make the trip with you
to headquarters

27:09.862 --> 27:11.197
and hand this drive off
face-to-face.

27:12.765 --> 27:15.668
See, when Naz is officially
off the roster,

27:15.702 --> 27:16.969
you're going
to be looking for

27:17.003 --> 27:18.905
a more permanent replacement
here at the CJC

27:18.938 --> 27:20.873
and I'd like to be considered
for that position.

27:20.907 --> 27:24.744
Well, if what is on those files

27:24.777 --> 27:28.815
is as groundbreaking
as you say it is,

27:28.848 --> 27:30.249
you can write
your own ticket.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.053
Next flight to D.C.

27:34.086 --> 27:35.788
You and me.

27:35.822 --> 27:37.824
Thank you, sir.

27:42.995 --> 27:44.997
*

27:55.107 --> 27:56.208
REBECCA:
What are you doing?

27:56.242 --> 27:58.077
Okay. I know.

27:58.110 --> 27:59.846
This looks unconventional,
but bear with me.

27:59.879 --> 28:02.715
I saw the fusion cell photo
of the Wong Sa you got,

28:02.749 --> 28:04.083
the one the Malaysian
naval ship took?
And?

28:04.116 --> 28:05.952
And in that picture,

28:05.985 --> 28:07.419
you can see the pirate crew.

28:07.453 --> 28:09.789
That is Ahmad Wan.

28:09.822 --> 28:11.057
He was part of the crew

28:11.090 --> 28:12.825
that turned the Wong Sa
into a pirate ship.

28:12.859 --> 28:14.894
Our guys think he may have
led the mutiny.

28:14.927 --> 28:16.796
He was arrested,
but the charges got dropped.

28:16.829 --> 28:18.430
I'm guessing his men
threw some bribe money

28:18.464 --> 28:19.932
at the Malaysian officials.
He looks familiar.

28:19.966 --> 28:21.500
Yeah, I bet he does.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.402
It's probably because
you've seen his picture

28:23.435 --> 28:24.937
in the NYPD's narcotics files.

28:24.971 --> 28:26.338
You mean he's here
in New York?

28:26.372 --> 28:27.373
Yeah!

28:27.406 --> 28:30.276
In fact, the guys
in your criminal department

28:30.309 --> 28:32.912
think he's managing
a thriving opium trade

28:32.945 --> 28:34.781
literally right here,
in the city.

28:34.814 --> 28:37.383
How did you even know to look
in that narcotics file?

28:37.416 --> 28:38.484
Are you serious?

28:38.517 --> 28:39.986
I've read all the files
in that place.

28:40.019 --> 28:42.021
So this guy, Wan,

28:42.054 --> 28:44.023
is our one connection
to Wong Sa.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.491
Yes. Which is why I'm down here.

28:45.524 --> 28:47.159
To wait, make a spectacle...

28:47.193 --> 28:48.995
and hopefully, eventually,

28:49.028 --> 28:50.997
I'll get taken in by Wan's guys
and you can follow me.

28:51.030 --> 28:53.032
Let's do this.
(whoops)

28:56.568 --> 28:57.870
Big day for you.

28:57.904 --> 28:58.905
You ready?

29:00.907 --> 29:01.841
Just doing
my job, sir.

29:01.874 --> 29:02.942
(chuckles)

29:02.975 --> 29:04.376
Company man all the way.

29:04.410 --> 29:05.411
I like it.

29:07.046 --> 29:09.315
All right.

29:09.348 --> 29:12.018
Screw, marry, kill.

29:12.051 --> 29:16.856
Um, Mike, Ike
or... Taurus.

29:16.889 --> 29:17.857
Remember? The bomb maker?

29:17.890 --> 29:18.858
Go.

29:18.891 --> 29:21.127
Are we seriously
doing this?

29:21.160 --> 29:22.829
Want me to go first?

29:22.862 --> 29:23.896
Not really.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.865
I would screw Mike

29:25.898 --> 29:27.066
and marry Ike.

29:29.035 --> 29:31.037
I'd kill Taurus.

29:31.070 --> 29:32.304
He had a couple of
cool cars, though.

29:32.338 --> 29:33.305
Is this something
that you think about?

29:33.339 --> 29:35.141
It's your turn.

29:37.910 --> 29:40.046
I would kill Taurus.
Yeah.

29:40.079 --> 29:42.081
I'd marry Ike...

29:42.114 --> 29:43.415
I'm sorry, which one is Ike?

29:43.449 --> 29:44.416
Ah, it doesn't matter.

29:44.450 --> 29:45.417
Moving on. Round two.

29:45.451 --> 29:47.987
Uh, Casey...

29:48.020 --> 29:50.322
Boyle...

29:50.356 --> 29:52.024
Finch.

29:52.058 --> 29:53.192
You can't put yourself
into the game.

29:53.225 --> 29:54.560
Who says?

29:54.593 --> 29:57.096
Fine. I would screw Casey,
I would m...

29:57.129 --> 29:58.597
Oh, God, I couldn't marry Boyle.

29:58.630 --> 29:59.899
"Bird studied by Darwin."

29:59.932 --> 30:00.933
Finch.

30:00.967 --> 30:02.501
Kill Finch.
Finch.

30:02.534 --> 30:04.536
I would definitely
kill Finch.

30:04.570 --> 30:05.537
What?

30:05.571 --> 30:07.106
(car approaches rapidly)

30:08.474 --> 30:10.209
BRIAN:
Speaking of killing...

30:10.242 --> 30:12.078
showtime.

30:18.417 --> 30:20.519
(speaking Malay)

30:20.552 --> 30:22.021
If this is related
to my sandwich board,

30:22.054 --> 30:23.389
can you give me
some kind of signal?

30:26.092 --> 30:27.994
(speaks Malay)

30:28.027 --> 30:29.361
Hey, ah...

30:37.003 --> 30:39.538
(phone ringing)

30:39.571 --> 30:40.873
You guys go ahead.

30:40.907 --> 30:42.574
Nice to see you in town,
Spellman.

30:42.608 --> 30:43.642
Thanks, Loretta.

30:43.675 --> 30:44.877
Good to be back.

30:44.911 --> 30:45.978
It's been
a long time.
Has it?

30:46.012 --> 30:48.047
Seems like just yesterday

30:48.080 --> 30:49.415
you were aide
to the deputy director.

30:49.448 --> 30:50.983
And look at you now,

30:51.017 --> 30:52.184
doing so well in New York.

30:52.218 --> 30:54.620
When I heard
you were coming,

30:54.653 --> 30:56.488
I had to make you
your favorite.

31:02.294 --> 31:04.130
She's always had
a bit of a crush.

31:04.163 --> 31:06.065
Just make sure she
didn't spike them.

31:06.098 --> 31:08.167
You don't want her
to go all Misery on you.

31:18.510 --> 31:20.079
BOYLE:
EAD Paulson.

31:20.112 --> 31:21.914
I didn't realize it was you
I'd be meeting with.

31:21.948 --> 31:23.415
Special Agent Boyle.

31:23.449 --> 31:25.317
I understand you have
something for me.

31:32.024 --> 31:33.225
Uh, don't misunderstand me.

31:33.259 --> 31:36.428
Naz has done great things
with the CJC.

31:36.462 --> 31:38.497
But she's lost
her perspective

31:38.530 --> 31:40.199
of the larger picture
a long time ago.

31:40.232 --> 31:41.067
Yes, sir.

31:41.100 --> 31:43.302
Especially when it comes
to Brian Finch.

31:43.335 --> 31:45.304
No good comes from hoarding

31:45.337 --> 31:47.339
a resource like that
to a single division.

31:47.373 --> 31:49.041
BOYLE:
I completely agree, sir.

31:49.075 --> 31:51.043
We follow protocols
for a reason.

31:51.077 --> 31:52.945
We should know by now

31:52.979 --> 31:54.113
why Finch is immune to NZT.

31:54.146 --> 31:56.548
JOHNSON:
We're going to deploy
a more restrictive setup

31:56.582 --> 31:59.085
for Finch in D.C.,
so we can focus full-time

31:59.118 --> 32:00.386
on that very issue.

32:00.419 --> 32:03.189
Now, I think Agent Boyle
can be an asset

32:03.222 --> 32:06.092
in a leadership role at CJC.

32:06.125 --> 32:08.260
Well, if that thumb drive can
cut through all the red tape

32:08.294 --> 32:09.528
and legally sanction

32:09.561 --> 32:11.297
Brian's residency here,

32:11.330 --> 32:14.200
then get used
to calling yourself

32:14.233 --> 32:15.401
Special Agent in Charge.

32:18.237 --> 32:20.306
Yes, sir.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.280
*

32:41.293 --> 32:43.295
(grunts)

32:51.403 --> 32:54.540
If you have something to say,
budak putih, you should say it.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.177
Who's this snitch you know?

32:58.210 --> 33:01.647
Actually, I'm not here to talk
about an informant.

33:01.680 --> 33:05.251
I'm here because I know you
once captained the Wong Sa,

33:05.284 --> 33:08.454
and you, Ahmad Wan, were
one of the greatest

33:08.487 --> 33:10.422
Malaysian pirates of your time.

33:10.456 --> 33:13.292
Some of your old
shipmates have someone

33:13.325 --> 33:16.162
who is very,
very important to me.

33:16.195 --> 33:19.565
As a favor, I'm hoping
you could make a call

33:19.598 --> 33:22.000
and ask for her release.

33:24.270 --> 33:25.737
(snickers)

33:32.344 --> 33:36.215
Nice space, by the way.

33:36.248 --> 33:37.683
Little personal feedback:

33:37.716 --> 33:40.519
I'd go up in the fear factor
just a little bit.

33:40.552 --> 33:43.689
It's good, it's really good,
what you've got going on,

33:43.722 --> 33:45.357
but it's, like, a six, 6.5.

33:45.391 --> 33:47.226
You could do better,
I'm just saying.

33:47.259 --> 33:50.362
Maybe I can make you
a permanent decoration.

33:50.396 --> 33:51.830
(Brian laughs)

33:51.863 --> 33:53.832
Me? No.

33:53.865 --> 33:55.834
I bet I can do something better.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.503
Anything you want, name it.

33:57.536 --> 33:59.471
Money's not
a problem.

33:59.505 --> 34:01.207
Unless, of course,
you've fallen out of favor

34:01.240 --> 34:03.242
with your old crew and then...
(clicks tongue)

34:07.479 --> 34:08.580
Take him out back.

34:08.614 --> 34:10.149
Wait, wait.

34:10.182 --> 34:11.383
Wait. Schoolgirl Reaper.

34:11.417 --> 34:14.253
(speaks Malay)

34:14.286 --> 34:16.388
What did you say?
Schoolgirl Reaper.

34:16.422 --> 34:18.724
Yeah.

34:18.757 --> 34:20.692
You collect rare
pinball machines, right?

34:20.726 --> 34:22.428
CHOIR:
* Ah...

34:22.461 --> 34:25.464
Schoolgirl Reaper, it's the
rarest pinball machine there is.

34:25.497 --> 34:26.732
They only made one prototype.

34:26.765 --> 34:29.535
Then they decided it was way too
tasteless for mass production.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.870
It was ahead of its time--
electroluminescent lights...

34:31.903 --> 34:34.140
BRIAN: Or so said my roommate,
whose yapping was

34:34.173 --> 34:36.142
one of the reasons
I dropped out of college.

34:36.175 --> 34:37.476
Hey, man, you listening to me?

34:37.509 --> 34:38.610
And then for some
reason, they halted...

34:38.644 --> 34:39.745
I said "one of."

34:39.778 --> 34:40.879
...manufacturing.

34:40.912 --> 34:43.682
The company went under,
and the one prototype they made,

34:43.715 --> 34:46.352
it's the most coveted machine
in all the world of pinball.

34:46.385 --> 34:49.388
No one can get
Schoolgirl Reaper.

34:49.421 --> 34:51.390
What if I can?

34:51.423 --> 34:53.259
If I do that for you,

34:53.292 --> 34:56.195
will you parlay with your
old crew and release my friend?

34:58.364 --> 35:01.333
Okay, we need to go see
a Mr. Timothy Urbaniak

35:01.367 --> 35:02.801
of Demarest,
New Jersey, right now.

35:02.834 --> 35:04.503
Who's that?
The guy who has

35:04.536 --> 35:06.638
the only Schoolgirl Reaper
pinball machine in existence.

35:06.672 --> 35:08.540
Shotgun!
I'm driving.

35:09.441 --> 35:10.476
Good work with Boyle.

35:10.509 --> 35:12.478
(Paulson clears throat,
chuckles)

35:12.511 --> 35:15.581
I knew he'd turn out to be

35:15.614 --> 35:16.582
a loyal foot soldier.

35:16.615 --> 35:18.250
You got to... press...

35:18.284 --> 35:20.586
(Paulson clears throat)

35:20.619 --> 35:22.288
PAULSON:
Okay, bam.

35:23.922 --> 35:25.491
(under his breath):
All right.

35:25.524 --> 35:27.293
*

35:32.298 --> 35:33.632
Loretta!

35:34.933 --> 35:37.603
Where's Boyle?
I believe he left, sir.

35:37.636 --> 35:39.471
Uh... I-I...

35:39.505 --> 35:40.606
I'm having a...

35:40.639 --> 35:42.274
One sec,
I'll get it.

35:42.308 --> 35:44.310
*

36:02.628 --> 36:04.930
(geese honk)

36:06.332 --> 36:07.466
I've been offered

36:07.499 --> 36:09.468
three-quarters of a million
dollars for this machine,

36:09.501 --> 36:11.637
and you want me to give it away?
To a pirate?

36:11.670 --> 36:13.772
Well, there's also
that girl who will die

36:13.805 --> 36:15.641
Yes.
if you don't do it.

36:15.674 --> 36:17.676
*

36:34.293 --> 36:36.595
BRIAN: Mitra was on a plane
just a few hours later.

36:36.628 --> 36:38.597
Turns out the old pirate
really did have sway

36:38.630 --> 36:39.765
with his old crew.

36:45.671 --> 36:48.507
And so did Boyle.

36:49.608 --> 36:51.877
BOYLE: When I was an aide
at headquarters,

36:51.910 --> 36:53.879
I learned a lot of interesting
things about Loretta.

36:53.912 --> 36:55.547
She's been there
since Watergate.

36:55.581 --> 36:58.550
I used to think
she was Deep Throat.

36:58.584 --> 37:00.252
Loretta's a
constitutional watchdog.

37:00.286 --> 37:01.887
She holds onto documents
she thinks are sensitive,

37:01.920 --> 37:03.622
just in case they need
to be presented

37:03.655 --> 37:05.257
to the House
subcommittee.
So you called her.

37:05.291 --> 37:07.793
Yeah, when Rebecca
said that, uh,

37:07.826 --> 37:10.329
the conspiracy against Naz
involved top brass,

37:10.362 --> 37:11.430
yeah, I had to.

37:11.463 --> 37:13.265
Thank you for that.

37:14.866 --> 37:16.702
Question is,

37:16.735 --> 37:18.270
what do we do with it now?

37:18.304 --> 37:19.738
I know.

37:22.007 --> 37:24.643
Guys.

37:24.676 --> 37:27.646
My dad used to work
with the ACLU.

37:27.679 --> 37:30.549
Maybe he can get in touch
with some old friends?

37:31.650 --> 37:33.852
It's worth a shot, right?

37:33.885 --> 37:36.422
Here, let me make
a copy of this.

37:42.728 --> 37:44.563
Hey, Bec.

37:44.596 --> 37:46.031
Hmm?

37:46.064 --> 37:48.567
You asked why
Johnson trusted me.

37:48.600 --> 37:52.571
When Finch first started here,

37:52.604 --> 37:55.574
I thought this whole thing was
gonna blow up in our faces,

37:55.607 --> 37:57.743
and I wrote a memo
protesting it.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.711
That's why Johnson
came to me.

37:59.745 --> 38:01.046
I should have told you about it.

38:01.079 --> 38:02.581
I'm sorry.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.616
Yeah, I was worried, too.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.454
You're good with him now, right?

38:08.487 --> 38:10.789
I went to D.C., didn't I?

38:13.592 --> 38:17.563
BRIAN: I know,
I'm asking for a favor.

38:17.596 --> 38:20.632
But if an important senator
took notice of this,

38:20.666 --> 38:24.803
I think that would be
politically valuable.

38:24.836 --> 38:28.674
Like, "Edward Morra
shines the light

38:28.707 --> 38:30.442
on black ops
in the United States"?

38:30.476 --> 38:32.944
I mean, that's real "man of
the people" kind of stuff.

38:33.879 --> 38:36.615
Hmm, still.

38:36.648 --> 38:38.484
Seems more like
a Brian Finch problem

38:38.517 --> 38:40.486
than a Senator
Morra one.

38:40.519 --> 38:42.654
No, n-n-n-no, no, no, no, no,
see, that's where you're wrong.

38:42.688 --> 38:44.956
Okay?

38:44.990 --> 38:47.993
For whatever reason, you guys
wanted me in the CJC, right?

38:48.026 --> 38:51.663
If Naz is replaced,
I might be moved,

38:51.697 --> 38:53.365
I might not have
the same access,

38:53.399 --> 38:54.566
and more importantly,

38:54.600 --> 38:57.836
you won't know what the new
boss' disposition to NZT is

38:57.869 --> 38:59.605
or the people who take it.

39:01.740 --> 39:04.710
Naz is the
devil you know.

39:04.743 --> 39:06.712
And if you want me in the CJC,

39:06.745 --> 39:10.516
you're gonna want her free
as much as you do me.

39:14.453 --> 39:16.422
REPORTER: In a surprising
shake-up at the FBI,

39:16.455 --> 39:17.623
longtime Executive Assistant
Director Paulson,

39:17.656 --> 39:21.727
of the elite Criminal Cyber
Response and Services Unit,

39:21.760 --> 39:23.061
resigned today.

39:23.094 --> 39:24.996
Deputy Director Rovick
commented.

39:25.030 --> 39:29.635
EAD Paulson has been an
invaluable member of the Bureau.

39:29.668 --> 39:32.103
We wish him much luck
with his next endeavor.

39:32.137 --> 39:33.639
We'll begin...
(TV clicks off)

39:33.672 --> 39:34.573
That was my mom.
Yeah?

39:34.606 --> 39:37.676
She's free and my cousin
lands in an hour.

39:37.709 --> 39:40.579
We got 'em.
Brian, I don't
even know what to say.

39:45.150 --> 39:46.818
(cell phone buzzes)

39:49.788 --> 39:51.423
BRIAN:
Oh, no.

39:51.457 --> 39:54.426
I got to go.

39:54.460 --> 39:57.463
(sighs)
I still work for your mom.

39:58.797 --> 40:00.766
Well, then I'll just
have to figure out a way

40:00.799 --> 40:03.134
to get you fired
from the CJC.

40:05.471 --> 40:07.606
I'm sorry.

40:09.475 --> 40:11.477
(door opens)

40:13.011 --> 40:14.680
Hey.

40:14.713 --> 40:16.548
Oh, glad that DIC's gone.

40:16.582 --> 40:18.984
Johnson.

40:19.017 --> 40:21.086
ADIC Johnson.
ADIC Johnson.

40:21.119 --> 40:22.754
A-D-I-C.

40:22.788 --> 40:24.089
Whatever.

40:24.122 --> 40:25.991
Man, I missed this place.

40:26.024 --> 40:28.193
We owe your dad's
friends a big thank you.

40:28.226 --> 40:29.828
(elevator bell dings)
Yeah.
I haven't forgotten.

40:32.864 --> 40:34.566
(applause)

40:44.275 --> 40:45.911
ADIC Johnson.

40:45.944 --> 40:47.245
You sent me
a number of texts.

40:47.278 --> 40:48.780
I'm sorry I was
unable to respond

40:48.814 --> 40:51.249
while I was incarcerated.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.784
And I do hope
everything's all right

40:52.818 --> 40:55.120
with your little...
condition.

40:55.153 --> 40:56.722
Uh, no.

40:58.824 --> 41:00.125
ROVICK:
I owe both of you

41:00.158 --> 41:01.793
a big apology.

41:01.827 --> 41:04.095
Did Paulson say anything?

41:04.129 --> 41:08.099
That he took responsibility
and that he would go quietly.

41:08.133 --> 41:09.935
Naz, I will come to New York,

41:09.968 --> 41:12.904
and we can discuss
everything in detail.

41:12.938 --> 41:14.840
We will.

41:14.873 --> 41:17.643
(TV clicks off)

41:20.078 --> 41:21.580
Thanks, Brian.

41:21.613 --> 41:23.849
Come on, Naz,
it's the least I could do.

41:26.818 --> 41:30.789
I'll be in the file
room if you need me.

41:30.822 --> 41:32.758
So you stayed
in my apartment.

41:32.791 --> 41:34.693
With my daughter.

41:34.726 --> 41:37.696
I did, yes.

41:37.729 --> 41:39.164
And she is a lovely girl.

41:39.197 --> 41:40.532
Woman.

41:40.566 --> 41:43.001
And it was lovely
getting to know her.

41:43.034 --> 41:44.235
I don't know her.

41:44.269 --> 41:47.138
We spent time together,
platonically.

41:47.172 --> 41:50.041
We see eye-to-eye
on that...

41:50.075 --> 41:51.677
Hmm.

41:55.046 --> 41:56.782
BRIAN:
You know what?

41:56.815 --> 41:58.950
You should be
proud of her.

41:58.984 --> 42:01.587
She's almost as cool as her mom.

42:01.620 --> 42:02.988
(chuckles)

42:03.021 --> 42:04.890
Just saying...

42:04.923 --> 42:05.924
Finch.

42:05.957 --> 42:08.193
Mm-hmm?

42:08.226 --> 42:10.028
Ava could do worse.

42:10.061 --> 42:11.597
(chuckles)

42:13.098 --> 42:15.033
*

42:15.066 --> 42:17.936
(bells dinging)

42:22.240 --> 42:23.709
(cheering)
