Â™ªâ™ª

00:04.806 --> 00:07.176
Did You Ever Imagine
What Your Parents Were Like

00:07.209 --> 00:09.144
When They Were Kids?

00:09.177 --> 00:12.014
Hard To Imagine, Right?

00:12.046 --> 00:13.248
Or, If You're Like Me,

00:13.280 --> 00:16.085
You Just Assume
That They Were Born Parents.

00:16.117 --> 00:17.653
Well, They Weren't.

00:17.685 --> 00:18.953
Trust Me.

00:20.254 --> 00:23.591
The Only Thing Scarier Than
Imagining Your Parents Being Young,

00:23.624 --> 00:26.194
Is Actually Having
To Live With Them That Way.

00:26.228 --> 00:29.732
That's Exactly
What Happened To Me.

00:29.765 --> 00:31.166
Science Fiction, You Think?

00:32.701 --> 00:33.869
Oh, No.

00:33.901 --> 00:35.903
This Is My Neighbor.

00:35.937 --> 00:36.939
Average, Right?

00:36.971 --> 00:38.239
Average House,

00:38.272 --> 00:40.575
Average Sister,

00:40.608 --> 00:42.577
Average Friends.

00:42.610 --> 00:46.915
And Now, For You Nonbelievers,
Meet My Mom.

00:49.016 --> 00:52.354
I Want My Bottle!

00:52.387 --> 00:53.722
And My Dad.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.958
Norty Make
A Mess.

00:57.826 --> 01:00.896
Hey, I Told You
This Wasn't Science Fiction.

01:00.928 --> 01:03.598
This Is My Life.

01:03.631 --> 01:05.800
And It's All Because Of...

01:08.303 --> 01:10.605
It All Started
On An Average Morning,

01:10.638 --> 01:13.007
Or At Least,
Average At My House.

01:23.351 --> 01:24.685
How Can You
Just Sit There?

01:24.718 --> 01:26.321
They're Gonna Blow
The Whole House Up.

01:26.354 --> 01:29.090
Nah, That Wasn't
Any Worse Than Usual.

01:29.123 --> 01:31.025
Well, At Least
The Primary...

01:32.293 --> 01:34.629
Told You The Proton Generator Was Overtorqued.

01:34.662 --> 01:35.831
Norton,
I'm Telling You,

01:35.863 --> 01:37.765
It's The Electron Ignition System.

01:37.798 --> 01:38.766
Are You Two
All Right?

01:38.800 --> 01:40.268
We're Better
Than All Right.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.303
Marie, We're On The Verge
Of A Breakthrough.

01:42.337 --> 01:44.706
It Sounded More
Like A Breakdown.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.841
Oh, No, Dear,
We're Fine.

01:46.875 --> 01:49.010
It's As Your Father
Always Says...

01:50.744 --> 01:53.247
"Science Is
Rarely Pretty."

01:54.281 --> 01:56.351
Look, Please Just Be Sure
You're Ready By 1:00.

01:56.384 --> 01:58.253
For What?

01:58.286 --> 01:59.888
Told You They
Wouldn't Remember.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.423
Our Graduation.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.425
Duh.

02:03.458 --> 02:04.959
I Can't Believe
You Guys!

02:06.461 --> 02:08.797
We Knew That.
We Were Just Putting You On.

02:08.830 --> 02:10.364
Yeah, Uh, Gotcha!

02:13.969 --> 02:16.037
Oh! Out Of My Way,
You Mongrel.

02:16.070 --> 02:17.872
I Think
If We Reconfigure

02:17.905 --> 02:19.207
The Particlization
Mechanism, We Can--

02:19.241 --> 02:21.410
Honey, I'm Telling You,
It's The Ignition System.

02:21.443 --> 02:22.910
I Know.

02:21.443 --> 02:22.910
Thank You.

02:22.944 --> 02:24.245
Einstein, Go!

02:27.182 --> 02:31.153
You Know What?
I Will Not Be Humiliated At Graduation Today.

02:31.185 --> 02:33.087
Sure, You Will.

02:33.120 --> 02:35.089
Then You'll Sulk
For A Day Or Two,

02:35.123 --> 02:36.090
Drown
Your Sorrows

02:36.124 --> 02:37.392
In A Vat
Of Thick Shakes,

02:37.425 --> 02:40.229
And Add A Few Unsightly Inches To Your Hips.

02:41.396 --> 02:42.998
You Know What?
I Hate To Tell You,

02:43.030 --> 02:44.298
But Just Because
You Skipped A Grade

02:44.332 --> 02:46.101
Doesn't Mean
You Know Everything.

02:46.134 --> 02:47.736
Wanna Bet?

02:50.205 --> 02:51.239
Â™ª I'm Your Bro â™ª

02:51.273 --> 02:52.774
â™ª In The Know â™ª

02:52.807 --> 02:54.275
â™ª Star Of The Show â™ª

02:54.308 --> 02:56.043
â™ª So Out Ya Go â™ª

02:56.076 --> 02:58.746
â™ª You're Blocking My Glow â™ª

02:58.779 --> 03:01.916
Please, Save The Concert
For The Bathroom,

03:01.950 --> 03:04.987
With The Water Running
Full-Force.

03:06.487 --> 03:10.791
Laugh Now, But Next Year,
When We're In High School,

03:10.825 --> 03:12.761
I'm Gonna Be
An Urban...

03:12.793 --> 03:14.929
Slug.

03:14.963 --> 03:19.034
You'll Be An Urban Slug The
Day I Turn Into Britney Spears.

03:19.066 --> 03:20.903
Nice To Meet You, Britney.

03:21.903 --> 03:24.138
Look, Colin
Got Me An Audition

03:24.172 --> 03:26.041
To Be Slug's
New Bass Player.

03:26.074 --> 03:27.910
And If I Get In,

03:27.943 --> 03:30.178
You're Gonna Be
So Green With Envy,

03:30.211 --> 03:32.848
People Will Be
Calling You...

03:32.880 --> 03:34.382
Green With Envy.

03:38.420 --> 03:41.489
Man, Wouldn't It Be Nice
To Be Lizzie Cook?

03:41.523 --> 03:44.226
Look At Her.
She's Talking To Her Parents,

03:44.259 --> 03:45.893
Without An Interpreter.

03:45.927 --> 03:48.130
<I>And They're
Actually Listening.

03:48.162 --> 03:51.967
Yeah, And I Guess When They Sit In A Chair,

03:51.999 --> 03:53.267
You Know,
I'm Guessing That, You Know,

03:53.301 --> 03:54.769
It Acts Like...

03:55.904 --> 03:57.039
Whoa.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.206
A Chair.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.509
Hmm.

04:00.541 --> 04:02.443
At Least There's One Hope.

04:02.476 --> 04:05.179
Maybe When Our Parents Test
Their Time Travel Machine Today,

04:05.213 --> 04:07.950
They'll Accidentally Send Themselves
Back Into The Stone Age.

04:07.982 --> 04:10.319
Then We'll Get
A Well-Deserved Break.

04:11.386 --> 04:15.089
It's Not That We Didn't
Love Our Parents. We Did.

04:15.122 --> 04:19.026
It Was Just Sometimes We Had
A Really Hard Time Relating.

04:19.059 --> 04:21.463
See, This Was The Day
That They Were Gonna Do

04:21.495 --> 04:25.167
Their First Official Trial
Of Their Time Travel Machine.

04:25.199 --> 04:27.069
And Their First
Test Subjects,

04:27.102 --> 04:29.804
2 Really
Funky-Looking Goldfish.

04:29.838 --> 04:32.441
Specimens
Ready For Time Travel.

04:32.473 --> 04:36.277
Begin Initial
Countdown Sequence...

04:36.311 --> 04:39.181

And Counting.

04:39.213 --> 04:40.949

Equation Entered?

04:40.982 --> 04:41.950
Affirmative.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.285

Ratio Factored?

04:43.317 --> 04:44.585
Affirmative.

04:44.619 --> 04:47.922

Override Engaged?

04:47.956 --> 04:49.357
Double Affirmative.

04:51.960 --> 04:54.196
Who Let That Mongrel
Down Here?

04:54.228 --> 04:56.364
Oh, Norton,
It's Not Einstein's Fault

04:56.398 --> 04:57.833
That You Neglected
To Close The Door

04:57.865 --> 04:59.033
At The Top Of The Stairs.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.434
That Dog Has A Talent

05:00.468 --> 05:02.470
For Being In The Wrong Place At The Wrong Time.

05:02.504 --> 05:04.939
Oh, Be Nice.
All He Wants To Do Is Play Catch.

05:04.973 --> 05:06.107
It's Just A Pest.

05:06.141 --> 05:08.309
Go Upstairs! Shoo!
Go On Upstairs!

05:08.343 --> 05:10.379
That Dog Could Ruin
The Whole Experiment.

05:12.513 --> 05:13.915

06:02.263 --> 06:03.999
Now, We Don't Want To
Go Into Scientific Detail,

06:04.032 --> 06:05.200
Because I Can't.

06:05.232 --> 06:07.134
But The Machine
Missing That Part,

06:07.167 --> 06:08.636
The Vector Modulator,

06:08.670 --> 06:12.473
Is A Bad Thing,
A Very Bad Thing.

06:12.506 --> 06:15.042
Didn't You Hear
What I Said? Scram.

06:15.710 --> 06:17.612

06:20.482 --> 06:23.452

All Right, With 2 Fermi Foundation Grants,
1 Schrodinger Fellowship

06:28.155 --> 06:31.593
And A Higgins Award On The Line,
Are We Ready?

06:31.626 --> 06:34.062
Ready To Make History!

06:34.095 --> 06:35.664
Or At Least Observe It.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.398
Then I Say,
Let's Commence.

06:37.432 --> 06:41.569

What Is Going On?

08:06.521 --> 08:07.756
They're Still Here.

08:07.788 --> 08:11.091
They're Supposed To Be
Back In September Of 1863.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.028
This Makes No Sense.

08:13.061 --> 08:15.697
I Mean,
We Went Over The Calculations 57 Times.

08:15.730 --> 08:18.732
58, Norton,
If You Count Reviewing The Data In My Dreams.

08:20.134 --> 08:21.403
It Was Supposed To Go Off
Without A Hitch.

08:23.838 --> 08:26.141
We Have Got To Go.

08:26.174 --> 08:27.342
The Graduation?

08:27.374 --> 08:28.776
What Graduation?

08:30.178 --> 08:31.346
Oh.

08:36.317 --> 08:38.653
<I>Carassius Auratus.

08:38.684 --> 08:41.222
De-Aged 2 Months.

08:41.256 --> 08:44.058
Ok, Mom,
Which One Of My Friends Is This?

08:44.092 --> 08:45.760
Oh, Marie,
I Don't Know.

08:45.793 --> 08:47.195
Annie.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.363
No, Mother.
This Is Samantha,

08:49.396 --> 08:50.497
And This Is Annie.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.132
Well, Annie, Samantha,

08:52.165 --> 08:54.236
I Mean, You All
Walk Around In Packs.

08:54.269 --> 08:55.637
Does It Really Matter?

08:55.670 --> 08:57.137
Ok, All Right.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.140
This Is
My Best Friend Lauren,

08:59.173 --> 09:02.376
And This Is
My Worst Enemy, Cloe.

09:05.413 --> 09:09.451
Come On, You Guys Got Ph.D.S
Memorizing Who Knows What.

09:09.483 --> 09:11.285
My Friends' Names
Should Be A Snap.

09:11.319 --> 09:12.820
All Right, All Right,
All Right.

09:12.853 --> 09:16.290
Would You Turn Down That
Irritating Noise You Call Music?

09:16.324 --> 09:18.093
So I Can Concentrate.

09:19.160 --> 09:21.829
Now, Which One
Is Annie Again?

09:24.299 --> 09:26.601
So, How Come
You Don't Have

09:26.633 --> 09:29.370
A Picture Of Colin In Your Little Stack?

09:29.404 --> 09:30.672
Why Would I?

09:30.704 --> 09:32.306
You Know You Have
A Crush On Him.

09:32.339 --> 09:33.507
Why Don't You
Just Admit It?

09:33.540 --> 09:34.642
Mom, Make
Him Stop.

09:34.675 --> 09:36.110
That's Enough.

09:36.144 --> 09:37.512
Both Of You Are
Just Far Too Young

09:37.545 --> 09:40.115
To Be So Preoccupied
With The Opposite Sex.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.682
Marie, When I Was
Your Age,

09:41.716 --> 09:44.251
Boys Were The Furthest Thing
From My Mind.

09:44.285 --> 09:46.554
Ooh, Big Surprise.

09:48.823 --> 09:50.125
With
The Other Parents,

09:50.157 --> 09:51.892
Feel Free To Talk About
The Stock Market.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.295
Why Would We
Do That?

09:53.328 --> 09:55.530
So You Sound Less Sciencey,
More Cool.

09:55.563 --> 09:58.433
Cool.
How Many Times Have I Told You I Hate That Word?

09:58.466 --> 10:01.536
"Eddie, I Need You To Take Out The Trash."
"Cool."

10:01.569 --> 10:03.704
"Grandma's Coming
To Visit." "Cool."

10:03.737 --> 10:07.208
"T-The World's Gonna End At Sunrise."
"Cool."

10:07.241 --> 10:08.510
There Are
So Many Other

10:08.543 --> 10:09.544
Descriptive
Adjectives

10:09.577 --> 10:10.645
In The English
Language.

10:10.678 --> 10:12.713
Cool.

10:13.814 --> 10:16.217
And If The Stock Market Doesn't Work For You Guys,

10:16.250 --> 10:20.689
Try The Lakers.
Here. I Wrote Notes.

10:20.722 --> 10:24.525
"Wow, That Shaq Has Sure Had
Some Impressive Stats Lately."

10:24.559 --> 10:25.894
Oh, Eddie.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.561
Eddie, We Don't
Need Those.

10:27.594 --> 10:29.396
We Know What's Going On In The World.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.665
Oh, Yeah?
What's Hip-Hop?

10:31.699 --> 10:33.535
Who's Lil' Bow Wow?

10:33.568 --> 10:35.670
Name One Movie
Or One Tv Show

10:35.703 --> 10:37.439
You've Seen
In The Last 5 Years.

10:37.472 --> 10:40.175
Oh, Well, That's Easy.
We Saw That, Uh,

10:40.208 --> 10:43.545
<I>Life Cycles Of The Earthworm Special
On Public Television Just Last Year.

10:43.578 --> 10:44.646
Now That, That
Was Entertainment.

10:44.679 --> 10:45.646
That Was Fantastic.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.247
I Rest My Case.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.917
Son, We Are Not
Going To Humiliate You.

10:49.950 --> 10:53.787
Now, Your Father And I, We Were Teenagers Once.
We Know How You Feel.

10:54.856 --> 10:57.659
Nobody Knows
How I Feel.

10:57.692 --> 10:59.427
I Do.

11:06.367 --> 11:10.738
Specimens De-Aged
To 1 Minute.

11:10.771 --> 11:14.908
Specimens In Final Phase
Before Poof Point

11:14.942 --> 11:17.512
And Nonexistence.

11:17.545 --> 11:19.881
Poof Point Approaching.

11:19.914 --> 11:23.684
Danger. Poof Point Reached.

11:26.788 --> 11:30.959
Poof Point Reached. Danger.

11:30.992 --> 11:33.660
Nonexistence Achieved.

11:33.694 --> 11:37.265
Amanda Suzanne Anderson.

11:41.299 --> 11:41.703
Congratulations.

11:44.005 --> 11:46.841
Edison Newton Ballard.

11:49.343 --> 11:50.878
Congratulations.

11:52.679 --> 11:55.416
Marie Curie Ballard.

11:55.449 --> 11:58.285
Congratulations.

12:01.555 --> 12:05.826
Lizzie Gail Cook.
Congratulations.

12:10.564 --> 12:13.801
Oh, Mom, Dad,
You Remember...

12:13.834 --> 12:14.802
Annie!

12:14.835 --> 12:16.603
And Lauren.

12:16.636 --> 12:18.405
Nice To See You Girls.

12:18.439 --> 12:21.309
Are You Elated About The
Advent Of The Summer Equinox?

12:23.578 --> 12:25.713
You Must Be
Thoroughly Excited

12:25.746 --> 12:28.850
About Advancing Your Education
At A Brand-New Venue.

12:33.453 --> 12:37.025
Oh, Oh, There's Colin.
See You Guys.

12:37.058 --> 12:39.427
Well, Good-Bye, Son.
Ha Ha Ha.

12:39.459 --> 12:40.961
Hey, Lizzie!

12:40.995 --> 12:42.297
Girl, Those
Shoes Are Tight.

12:42.329 --> 12:43.430
I Know! Aren't They?

12:44.464 --> 12:46.434
Look At Ben Garland.

12:46.467 --> 12:47.569
Come On, Let's Go
Torment Him.

12:47.602 --> 12:48.569
Yeah.

12:48.602 --> 12:49.904
Remember Our Talk
About Boys.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.538
Mom?

12:52.740 --> 12:55.410
Oh, Hey.
My Parents Are Over There If You Want To Say Hi.

12:55.443 --> 12:56.410
Um...

12:56.444 --> 12:57.578
Oh.

12:57.612 --> 12:58.913
Come On,
Let's Meet Them.

13:00.714 --> 13:02.883
Well, If You Ask Me,
There's Not A Single

13:02.916 --> 13:05.487
Consistently Outstanding Pitcher
In The National Leagues.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.489
Certainly, None Of Those Rookies Have Blown Me Away.

13:07.521 --> 13:10.525
Yeah, And That Shaq Sure Has
Some Impressive Stats Lately.

13:13.928 --> 13:15.963
I'm Surprised
To See You Here, Ballard.

13:15.997 --> 13:18.833
I Though You Only Got Out
When You Set The Lab On Fire.

13:18.866 --> 13:21.069
Now, Chick, Be Nice.

13:21.102 --> 13:23.538
What? I Was
Only Saying

13:23.570 --> 13:25.772
Corky And I Are Taking Bets On How Soon

13:25.805 --> 13:27.708
You'll Annihilate
The Entire Neighborhood.

13:27.742 --> 13:30.678
Well, To Allay Your Fears,
I'd Be More Than Delighted

13:30.710 --> 13:32.946
To Illuminate You
On Our Latest Research.

13:32.979 --> 13:35.949
It Involves A Machine To Send
An Organism Back In Time.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.551
I'll Show You How It Works With That Brownie Pan.

13:37.584 --> 13:38.752
Marigold!

13:39.587 --> 13:41.088
How Nice
To See You.

13:41.122 --> 13:42.756
Oh, It's Nice
To See You, Corky.

13:42.790 --> 13:44.825
Interesting
Jacket.

13:44.858 --> 13:47.761
Oh, Well,
As Is Your Sweater.

13:47.795 --> 13:49.063
Well, Do You Mind?

13:54.001 --> 13:55.970
Oh, It's Just As I Thought.

13:56.002 --> 13:58.573
50 % Polytreacle And, Uh,

13:58.606 --> 14:01.409
The Rest Is An Artificial...

14:01.442 --> 14:03.845
Yes, An Artificial
Petroleum Blend.

14:03.877 --> 14:07.581
It's Good-Looking,
But Highly Flammable.

14:09.750 --> 14:12.020
I'm Not Sure
If You've Got The Look.

14:12.053 --> 14:14.856
Urban Slugs Have Got To Be,
You Know...

14:14.889 --> 14:15.890
Smooth.

14:15.923 --> 14:18.693
Look, Just Hear Me Play, Ok?

14:18.726 --> 14:22.096
If I Blow You Away,
Then You Can Teach Me...

14:23.164 --> 14:25.133
Smooth.

14:25.165 --> 14:26.867
All Right.
You Get One Shot.

14:26.900 --> 14:30.704
Tomorrow, 3:00,
Your Place.

14:34.608 --> 14:37.844
Excuse Me, Would You Be Kind Enough
To Lend Me Your Glasses For A Moment?

14:37.877 --> 14:39.747
Norton, I Don't Think This Is A Good Idea.

14:39.780 --> 14:40.781
Thank You.

14:40.814 --> 14:42.916
Dad, What Are You Doing?

14:42.949 --> 14:47.854
A Simple Experiment.
These Kind Folks Practically Demanded It.

14:49.022 --> 14:52.459
Do You Have To Use
The Principal's Glasses?

14:52.492 --> 14:54.027
Pleasure To Meet You,
Dr. Ballard.

14:54.060 --> 14:54.995
I'm Larry Root.

14:55.029 --> 14:56.564
Nice To Meet You.

14:56.597 --> 14:58.165
The Photoelectric
Effect...

14:58.199 --> 15:00.568
What's Going On?

14:58.199 --> 15:00.568
Don't Ask.

15:00.601 --> 15:01.569
If Incidental Light Is Composed Of Discreet Particles

15:01.602 --> 15:03.103
Of Energy
Called Photons...

15:03.136 --> 15:04.571
Your Forgetting
That--

15:04.604 --> 15:06.440
Then The Energy
Of Each Photon

15:06.473 --> 15:08.475
Is Proportional
To Its Frequency.

15:08.508 --> 15:11.545
So, In Order
To Free Those Electrons,

15:11.578 --> 15:14.582
We Catch The Light,
And Move Them Through Time,

15:14.615 --> 15:17.585
Which Proves The Possibility Of Time Travel.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.119
Watch Carefully.

15:21.722 --> 15:24.458
Fire! Oh, Dear!
Oh, My!

15:25.492 --> 15:27.795
Help Him!
He's On Fire!

15:31.899 --> 15:35.203
Ooh, That Was One Great Day,
Wasn't It?

15:35.236 --> 15:36.771
Down, Dog.

15:36.804 --> 15:37.838
Oh, Yeah, Dad,
The Best.

15:37.872 --> 15:38.973
Especially The Part
When You Set

15:39.006 --> 15:40.241
The Principal's Head
On Fire.

15:40.274 --> 15:41.075
What Was Up With That?

15:41.107 --> 15:42.977
The Important Thing
Is That We Managed

15:43.010 --> 15:44.846
To Get Those Kids Excited About Science.

15:44.878 --> 15:46.113
Ha Ha. Well,
You Know What, Norty?

15:46.146 --> 15:47.648
I Think They Were
More Excited About

15:47.681 --> 15:50.584
The Paramedics
And The Fire Trucks.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.119
I'm Adopted, Aren't I?

15:52.152 --> 15:54.622
Somebody Dropped Me Off On The Porch In A Basket,

15:54.655 --> 15:57.592
And You Guys Are Just
Afraid To Tell Me.

15:59.226 --> 16:02.530
What Did We Do?

16:02.563 --> 16:04.131
Eddie, Honey?

16:04.165 --> 16:07.535
Be Honest. Did We
Embarrass You Today?

16:07.568 --> 16:09.771
Well, Uh...

16:12.173 --> 16:14.575
You Guys Know
What It Is.

16:14.607 --> 16:18.679
I Mean,
We Have All The Teachers We Need At School.

16:20.280 --> 16:24.251
At Home, It Would Be Nice
Just To Have A Mom And Dad.

16:29.622 --> 16:33.093
Well, The Truth Is, Norton,
When We Were Their Age,

16:33.126 --> 16:34.594
We Had
Sudden Mood Swings.

16:34.627 --> 16:36.263
We Never Swung That Far.

16:36.296 --> 16:38.098
Norton, Look!

16:39.900 --> 16:42.170
Where Did
The Fish Go?

16:42.203 --> 16:45.206
Um, My Guess Is
They're Either In 1863

16:45.238 --> 16:47.240
Listening To Lincoln
Give The Gettysburg Address,

16:47.274 --> 16:50.678
Or They Just
Popped Into The Ozone.

16:50.710 --> 16:54.848
Our Best Bet Is To Reenter The
Recalculated Ignition Sequence

16:54.881 --> 16:57.184
And Run Through
The Entire Procedure Again.

16:57.218 --> 16:59.587
What We Didn't Find Out Until A Lot Later,

16:59.620 --> 17:02.089
Was That When Einstein
Took The Vector Modulator,

17:02.123 --> 17:04.559
The Fish Didn't
Travel Back In Time.

17:04.590 --> 17:07.895
Instead, They Got
Younger And Younger

17:07.926 --> 17:10.830
Until They Reached The Point
Before They Were Born--

17:10.865 --> 17:13.067
The Poof Point.

17:13.098 --> 17:14.300
Ready?

17:14.335 --> 17:16.136
Yes.

17:16.169 --> 17:18.338
Transmission
Code Loaded.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.006
Press Enter.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.876

17:32.153 --> 17:33.354

17:33.386 --> 17:37.759
Molecular Particlization
Laser Transmitting.

17:37.791 --> 17:41.995
Attention!
Time's Arrow Systems Error.

17:42.029 --> 17:44.932
Beam Refracted.

17:44.964 --> 17:45.933
Unknown Variable.

17:45.965 --> 17:47.135
Oh...

17:47.167 --> 17:48.969
Marigold!

17:51.771 --> 17:54.274
Danger!
Vector Modulator Displaced.

17:54.308 --> 17:57.744
Danger!
Vector Modulator Displaced.

17:57.778 --> 17:58.846
Oh!

17:58.878 --> 18:00.881
Oh! Ahh!

18:00.915 --> 18:02.884
Specimens Identified.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.886
Specimens <I>Homo Sapien.

18:04.918 --> 18:07.722
One Male, One Female.

18:07.754 --> 18:08.889
Combined Weight,

18:08.923 --> 18:13.394
177.27 Kilograms.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.262
Ages 40.

18:15.296 --> 18:18.165
Metabolic Analysis Complete.

18:18.198 --> 18:20.367
Begin Time Travel.

18:21.367 --> 18:22.336
Aah!

18:22.368 --> 18:23.703
Oh!

18:26.440 --> 18:28.843
Caution!

18:28.876 --> 18:32.747
Specimens, De-Aging Mode.

18:32.780 --> 18:37.084
Subjects De-Aged To 21.

18:37.117 --> 18:40.387
System Shutdown.

18:45.192 --> 18:47.228
Are You Two
All Right?

18:47.261 --> 18:48.896
Now
What Did You Do?

18:48.928 --> 18:53.166
Uh, That Was
The Worst Explosion Yet.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.169
What's The Matter?

18:55.202 --> 18:59.040
Nothing, Man.
We're Cool.

18:59.973 --> 19:02.042
Did He Just Say, "Cool"?

19:04.411 --> 19:06.414
Totally Cool.

19:06.446 --> 19:08.114
But Do I
Know You?

19:08.147 --> 19:08.915
Funny, Dad.

19:08.948 --> 19:13.353
Dad? Ha Ha!
Why'd You Call Me Dad?

19:13.386 --> 19:15.155
Good Joke.

19:15.188 --> 19:18.325
Hold On, I See
What's Going Down.

19:18.358 --> 19:20.293
This Is One Of My Mother's Practical Jokes.

19:20.327 --> 19:23.731
Now, She Put You Kids Up To This,
Didn't She? Didn't She?

19:23.763 --> 19:25.031
Mom, You Know
Grandma's

19:25.065 --> 19:27.268
At The Mah-Jongg Tournament In Sacramento.

19:28.299 --> 19:30.070
Did You Two Get Hit In The Head Or Something?

19:30.104 --> 19:32.306
It's Us!
Eddie And--

19:32.338 --> 19:35.175
Oh, Ah, Wait, Wait, Wait.
Don't Tell Me.

19:35.209 --> 19:39.113
Edison Newton Ballard
And Marie Curie Ballard.

19:39.146 --> 19:40.982
All Right, Good,
So You Do Know Us.

19:41.014 --> 19:43.917
Ha! No, I Don't Know You,
But I Do Know

19:43.951 --> 19:45.386
My Meddling Mother's
Sense Of Humor.

19:45.418 --> 19:47.088
Now, Norton,
How Many Times Have I Told Her?

19:47.120 --> 19:48.255
At Least
A Million Times,

19:48.289 --> 19:51.224
I Am Not Gonna Have Children
Until I Finish My Doctorate.

19:51.258 --> 19:54.962
Now, That Old Busybody Went
Ahead And Hired These Poor Kids

19:54.994 --> 19:57.231
And Gave Them
A Couple Of Bucks

19:57.263 --> 19:59.132
And The Names That We've Set
Aside For Our Future Children.

19:59.165 --> 20:00.768
Your Mom...

20:00.800 --> 20:02.035
Your Mom Is About As Illogical

20:02.069 --> 20:03.738
As Trying To
Clone A Sheep.

20:03.771 --> 20:05.772
Ha Ha Ha!

20:05.806 --> 20:08.042
Whoa. Whoa!

20:08.075 --> 20:11.444
Wow! This
Is Slammin'.

20:11.478 --> 20:13.948
Marigold! It Looks
As If Someone

20:13.981 --> 20:15.116
Has Been Able
To Construct

20:15.148 --> 20:16.816
A Time's
Arrow Machine.

20:16.849 --> 20:21.054
Not Someone, Dad.
You. You And Mom.

20:21.088 --> 20:24.191
No, A Time's Arrow Machine
Is Something That Marigold And I

20:24.223 --> 20:26.927
Are Writing A Paper On For
Our Theoretical Physics Class.

20:26.961 --> 20:30.264
There's No Way It Can Be Built Until
Someone Comes Up With A More Portable--

20:30.297 --> 20:33.034
Computer.

20:33.067 --> 20:34.969
Wow!

20:35.001 --> 20:36.771
Wow!

20:36.803 --> 20:39.172
What Are These?

20:39.205 --> 20:42.208
Your Pcs?
You've Had Them For Years.

20:42.242 --> 20:43.376
What's Wrong
With You?

20:43.409 --> 20:45.045
You Know,
Maybe That Explosion

20:45.078 --> 20:46.313
Gave Them
Ambrosia.

20:46.347 --> 20:47.315
Amnesia.

20:47.348 --> 20:48.549
That's What I Said.

20:48.582 --> 20:51.084
All Right, Quick!
Who's The President Of The United States?

20:51.117 --> 20:53.287
What, You
Don't Know?

20:53.319 --> 20:54.888
Oh, This Is
Just The Pits.

20:54.922 --> 20:56.824
You See, Norton,
That Is Exactly Why

20:56.857 --> 20:58.792
I'm Reluctant
To Have Children.

20:58.826 --> 21:01.328
Please, I Need
To Hear It From You.

21:02.195 --> 21:03.930
The Ron-Man.

21:04.732 --> 21:07.335
Our Political Hero,
Ronald Reagan.

21:07.367 --> 21:08.836
That's Right.
That Nancy,

21:08.868 --> 21:10.136
She's Pretty Nifty,
Too, You Know.

21:10.169 --> 21:13.173
She Is Hot, But Not
As Hot As This. Wow!

21:16.143 --> 21:19.347
Look, You Say You've Been Married For 6 Months.

21:19.379 --> 21:21.982
The Truth Is,
You've Been Married For Over 18 Years.

21:22.015 --> 21:23.950
You Think You Live In An Apartment Near The College,

21:23.983 --> 21:25.453
But You Live Here
With Us.

21:25.485 --> 21:27.887
I Don't Know What
You Guys Did Down There,

21:27.921 --> 21:30.324
But My Whole Life,
All You've Ever Talked About Was Time Travel.

21:30.357 --> 21:32.460
Now The Only Thing That's Traveling Is Your Brains!

21:32.492 --> 21:35.328
Eddie, Calm Down.
You're Not Helping.

21:38.232 --> 21:39.399
Hold On.

21:40.367 --> 21:44.571
Here We Are
On Vacation...

21:44.605 --> 21:47.842
At A Physicists Convention Last Month.

21:48.675 --> 21:50.610
Oh, My Goodness.
Norton, Look At Us.

21:50.644 --> 21:52.078
I Mean, We Look Just...

21:52.111 --> 21:54.447
Totally Old.

21:54.481 --> 21:57.318
No Offense,
But How Do You Think You Look?

21:57.350 --> 21:59.986
Well, I Know
I Don't Look Like--

22:02.121 --> 22:03.289
Wha--

22:13.232 --> 22:15.069
Mmm, Foxy.

22:19.039 --> 22:20.875
You Look Foxy.

22:34.954 --> 22:36.589
Oh, Come On.

22:36.623 --> 22:39.226
You Really Don't See It,
Do You?

22:39.259 --> 22:40.895
O-O-Ok, Let's
Just Go With This.

22:40.927 --> 22:43.597
You Guys Claim That We Invented A Time Machine

22:43.629 --> 22:45.965
And We're On The Verge Of Making It Work.

22:45.999 --> 22:48.269
Ha Ha.
So Then How Did We Become 21 Again, Then, Huh?

22:48.301 --> 22:51.304
And More Importantly,
What Are You Guys Gonna Do About Fixing It?

22:51.338 --> 22:56.143
Forget Fixing It! I Feel, Unh, Unh,
Large And In Charge.

22:56.175 --> 22:58.378
Oh, Nortykins,
You Are So Slamboyant.

22:58.412 --> 23:03.250
And Look At My Marigold.
Mmm, Sizzlin'

23:03.282 --> 23:04.484
Oh, Gosh,
You Are Just So Hot.

23:04.518 --> 23:05.653
Come Here.

23:08.454 --> 23:11.357
Eww! Ok, Look,
Bad Vision.

23:14.027 --> 23:18.432
Â™ª And We
Will Live Forever â™ª

23:18.464 --> 23:23.203
â™ª Until The 12th
Of Never â™ª

23:23.236 --> 23:28.108
â™ª Our Voices
Will Ring Forever â™ª

23:28.142 --> 23:30.945
â™ª As One â™ª

23:30.978 --> 23:32.213
Oh, That's Our Song.

23:33.513 --> 23:37.383
Oh, A Dog!
Get That Mongrel Away From Me!

23:37.416 --> 23:39.319
At Least Some Things
Haven't Changed.

23:39.353 --> 23:41.155
Nortykins, Lighten Up.

23:41.187 --> 23:44.357
As An Undergrad,
A Puppy Ate His Thesis Paper,

23:44.390 --> 23:46.359
And He's Just Been
Down On Dogs Ever Since.

23:46.393 --> 23:48.496
So, That's How
It All Started.

23:48.529 --> 23:51.565
I Have No Intention
Of Playing With You.

23:51.598 --> 23:55.336
Ok, All Right,
Let's Say That We Just Believe All Of This.

23:55.368 --> 23:56.337
Well, Now What?

23:56.369 --> 23:58.338
You're
The Scientists,

23:58.371 --> 24:01.074
We Were Kind Of Hoping You'd Tell Us.

24:02.709 --> 24:05.646
So,
We Sent Our 21-Year-Old Parents Back Into The Lab

24:05.678 --> 24:08.482
To Try To Figure Out
How To Become 40 Again.

24:08.514 --> 24:10.483
Wow! This Is Incredible.

24:10.517 --> 24:15.122
And You're Actually Saying That Silly Billy Gates,
Who I Tutored In Calculus,

24:15.155 --> 24:16.523
Is Responsible
For All Of This?

24:16.557 --> 24:19.093
Yeah, Dad.
Now Get Over It! Focus!

24:19.126 --> 24:21.028
Eddie And I Are Gonna Go Up And Make Dinner.

24:21.060 --> 24:22.495
You Guys Keep Working.

24:24.298 --> 24:27.233
You Know, Marigold,
I Bet What We're Looking For

24:27.267 --> 24:29.703
Is Tied Directly Into That Last Goldfish Experiment.

24:29.735 --> 24:33.373
But Norton, Those Fish Didn't De-Age.
They Just Disappeared.

24:33.406 --> 24:35.542
That Is What
Trips Me Out.

24:35.576 --> 24:39.713
What If They Started
By De-Aging And Then...

24:41.548 --> 24:42.550
Oh...

24:42.582 --> 24:44.450
Poof!

24:44.483 --> 24:45.618
Oh.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.070
It's So Weird
Seeing Them At 21.

24:56.104 --> 24:57.771
Nortykins
And Mari-Muffin.

24:57.805 --> 24:59.274
I Know.

24:59.306 --> 25:02.176
They're... Slammin'.

25:02.209 --> 25:04.679
I Mean, What If
They Stay Like This?

25:04.711 --> 25:07.281
Making Out And Singing
Hits Of The Seventies.

25:11.219 --> 25:13.654
I Can't Believe There Are Actually People

25:13.688 --> 25:16.557
Right Across The Street Who Live Normal Lives.

25:16.591 --> 25:17.325
I Know.

25:17.357 --> 25:18.659
Kids!

25:18.692 --> 25:19.860
We Need To Talk.

25:21.362 --> 25:22.964
We Don't Want
You To Panic,

25:22.997 --> 25:24.733
Because Everything,
Ultimately,

25:24.766 --> 25:25.999
Is Going To Be Cool.

25:26.033 --> 25:27.936
But We Do Seem To Be Facing A Bit Of A, Uh...

25:27.969 --> 25:28.937
Situation.

25:28.969 --> 25:29.938
Situation.

25:29.970 --> 25:31.940
This Doesn't Sound Good.

25:31.972 --> 25:34.575
The Good News Is That Nortykins And I Are Sure

25:34.609 --> 25:35.677
That We've Discovered What Happened

25:35.709 --> 25:36.710
To Those Goldfish.

25:36.744 --> 25:38.079
And The
Bad News?

25:38.112 --> 25:41.282
They Didn't Go Time Traveling,
They Went Poof.

25:41.315 --> 25:42.750
What?

25:41.315 --> 25:42.750
What?

25:42.784 --> 25:44.252
They... Poofed.

25:44.285 --> 25:46.286
Well,
In Layman's Terms,

25:46.319 --> 25:49.623
They Regressed Themselves Right Out Of Existence.

25:51.726 --> 25:53.027
That's Layman's Terms?

25:53.059 --> 25:55.195
Wait, Wait.
So You're Saying That The Fish

25:55.229 --> 25:58.098
Got Younger And Younger
Until Finally They...

25:58.132 --> 25:59.366
Disappeared?

25:59.400 --> 26:00.468
Exactly. Right On!

26:00.500 --> 26:02.970
Is What Happened To The
Goldfish Gonna Happen To You?

26:03.004 --> 26:05.240
Are You Two Gonna Poof
And Disappear, Too?

26:05.273 --> 26:06.741
Marie, Chill Out.

26:06.774 --> 26:09.878
Nortykins And I,
We Are Going To Carefully Examine

26:09.911 --> 26:11.880
The Data Downstairs
To Determine

26:11.912 --> 26:13.347
Where The Experiment
Went Wrong--

26:13.381 --> 26:14.382
And Fix It.

26:14.414 --> 26:16.950
Did We Have
Any Colleagues,

26:16.984 --> 26:18.353
Anyone Who Would Know Anything About This?

26:18.385 --> 26:20.821
No. I Mean,
This Was All Part

26:20.854 --> 26:24.124
Of Some Top-Secret,
Schro-Something Or Other Grant.

26:24.158 --> 26:26.394
That's Why The College Moved
Your Lab Into The House.

26:26.427 --> 26:29.898
All Right, So,
Do You Have Any Idea Of How Long Until You Poof?

26:29.931 --> 26:32.299
Actually, We Do,
To The Precise Second.

26:32.333 --> 26:35.136
We Calculated The Time It Took
For The Goldfish To Vanish,

26:35.169 --> 26:37.205
Factored In Their Life Expectancy Versus Ours.

26:37.238 --> 26:39.207
Then, In A Worst-Case
Scenario,

26:39.239 --> 26:44.344
We'll Reach Poof Point At
Precisely 6:01 Tomorrow Evening.

27:27.220 --> 27:29.790
My Goodness. Kids,
It's After Midnight!

27:29.824 --> 27:31.726
Don't You Wanna
Go Upstairs And Crash?

27:31.758 --> 27:33.027
No Chance.

27:33.059 --> 27:35.028
That Clock Hits Zero,
You Guys Are History.

27:35.062 --> 27:35.930
We're Staying
Right Here

27:35.962 --> 27:38.165
To Make Sure Nothing Happens To You Guys.

27:38.199 --> 27:40.301
Norton, We Are
Going To Raise Teenagers

27:40.334 --> 27:43.872
Who Actually Want
To See Their Parents Live.

27:46.473 --> 27:47.841
Oh!

28:08.962 --> 28:11.331
O-O-Oh! I Got It.

28:11.364 --> 28:13.767
I Figured
It Out, Norton!

28:13.800 --> 28:14.835
I Know What
We Have To Do!

28:14.869 --> 28:17.171
Norton, I Know What We Have
To Do To Save Ourselves!

28:17.203 --> 28:19.473
What Is It, Marigold?
What Went Wrong? How Do We Fix It?

28:19.507 --> 28:21.075
Well, Well,
It's Really Quite Simple, Actually.

28:21.107 --> 28:22.743
As You Can See,
According To My Calculations...

28:22.777 --> 28:25.979
And Just When I Thought
Everything Was Gonna Be Cool...

28:26.013 --> 28:27.382
All We Ever
Really Needed Was--

28:27.414 --> 28:29.149
Guess What?

28:30.817 --> 28:32.319
Marigold, What's Happening?

28:32.353 --> 28:33.520
I...

28:34.454 --> 28:36.857
Mom And Dad De-Aged Again.

28:36.891 --> 28:38.258
What Are You Doing? Stop!

28:38.292 --> 28:40.395
The Solution, We--

28:48.102 --> 28:52.006
Whoa-Oh-Oh!
That Was Too Bizarre!

28:52.038 --> 28:53.007
Are You Two
All Right?

28:53.039 --> 28:55.276
I'm Superfine.

28:57.143 --> 28:59.146
I Don't Know Who You Are.

28:59.180 --> 29:02.450
Subjects De-Aged
To 14 Years.

29:02.482 --> 29:05.519
Matter Of Fact,
I Don't Even Know Where I Am.

29:05.553 --> 29:07.921
Well, That Makes
Two Of Us.

29:07.954 --> 29:11.325
Although I Do Know You,
Norton Ballard,

29:11.359 --> 29:13.494
And After The Way You Behaved At The Science Fair,

29:13.527 --> 29:15.997
I Never Want To
Talk To You Again.

29:16.029 --> 29:17.065
So Now You See
The Nightmare

29:17.097 --> 29:18.865
We Found Ourselves In.

29:18.899 --> 29:21.402
And As It Turns Out,
That Was Nothing

29:21.434 --> 29:23.270
Compared To
What Happened Next.

29:23.304 --> 29:27.441
Our Parents Turned Into
Hormonal Teenagers Just Like Us!

29:27.475 --> 29:29.577
And We Had
To Deal With Them!

29:29.610 --> 29:31.212
I Know It Doesn't
Make Any Sense,

29:31.245 --> 29:33.514
I Know It Sounds Insane,
But It's The Truth.

29:33.546 --> 29:37.884
What Can I Do To Get You To Believe Me?

29:37.918 --> 29:39.854
See This Zit?
It's Just Starting.

29:39.886 --> 29:42.322
But Trust Me,
It'll Be All Over My Face,

29:42.355 --> 29:44.325
Probably In Time
For Picture Day.

30:23.998 --> 30:24.966
Norton?

30:24.998 --> 30:28.102
You Play The Guitar?
Since When?

30:28.134 --> 30:30.238
Since Forever.

30:31.338 --> 30:33.173
What Are You Doing In There, Marigold?
Come On Out.

30:33.207 --> 30:34.342
Oh...

30:36.911 --> 30:38.145
What Do You Think?

30:40.280 --> 30:41.248
Um, Ha...

30:41.282 --> 30:43.551
Well, You...

30:43.584 --> 30:45.952
I Don't Know.

30:45.986 --> 30:49.023
Well, Doesn't It Look Like This On You, Though?

30:50.157 --> 30:51.125
No.

30:51.158 --> 30:52.193
Uhh!

30:52.226 --> 30:54.062
No, I Mean, Yes.
It's Just That

30:54.094 --> 30:55.962
You Just Kind Of...

30:55.996 --> 30:57.498
Uh, You Look Fine.

30:57.530 --> 31:00.934
Yeah, Well, How Can I
Expect You To Relate?

31:00.968 --> 31:02.903
I Mean, You're--
You're Beautiful.

31:02.937 --> 31:04.439
Everyone Says
I Look Like You.

31:04.471 --> 31:06.306
Oh, Yeah. I Wish.

31:06.340 --> 31:10.344
I Mean,
I Am A Science Geek, Marie...

31:10.376 --> 31:13.480
Who Looks Like
A Science Geek.

31:13.514 --> 31:15.416
But Wouldn't You
Think That A Guy

31:15.449 --> 31:18.419
Would Want To Be With Someone
Who Was His Intellectual Equal?

31:18.451 --> 31:22.123
I Don't Understand Why Norton
Feels So Threatened By Me.

31:22.155 --> 31:23.257
But I'll Tell You
One Thing.

31:23.289 --> 31:25.492
I Am Not Gonna
Dumb Myself Down For Him.

31:25.526 --> 31:28.629
No.
In The Name Of All The Sisters In The Movement,

31:28.661 --> 31:30.965
I Will Never,
Ever Do That,

31:30.998 --> 31:35.001
Not For Norton Ballard
Or Any Other Dumb Guy.

31:35.035 --> 31:36.437
You Know, What
Wigs Me Out In My Mind

31:36.469 --> 31:38.573
So Bad I Can
Barely Breathe

31:38.605 --> 31:40.407
Is The Fact
That Marigold Wilmoth

31:40.440 --> 31:43.076
Has The Nerve To Think
She's As Smart As Me.

31:43.110 --> 31:45.313
That's Why She's
Not Talking To Me.

31:45.345 --> 31:46.314
I Told Her I Could
Kick Her Keister

31:46.346 --> 31:48.449
Anytime
In A Science Bowl,

31:48.481 --> 31:51.084
And Now She's
All Bent Out Of Shape.

31:52.318 --> 31:55.589
Norton, You're Not 14.
You're 40.

31:55.623 --> 32:00.327
You Were 14 In 1974.
It's A Whole New Millennium!

32:00.361 --> 32:01.661
If You Don't
Start Believing Me,

32:01.694 --> 32:03.263
You're Gonna Poof
Out Of Existence,

32:03.296 --> 32:05.399
I Won't Have Parents,
And--And...

32:05.431 --> 32:07.334
You Won't
Have A Life, And...

32:07.367 --> 32:08.668
I'm Sorry To Be
Dumping All This On You,

32:08.701 --> 32:11.238
But If You're Not Gonna Be The Grownup,
Who Is?

32:11.271 --> 32:13.406
I Don't Know
What To Do!

32:13.440 --> 32:14.709
Ok, Whoa.

32:14.741 --> 32:17.478
You Are Just
A Little Too Intense,

32:17.510 --> 32:19.613
This Is All Too Heavy,

32:19.646 --> 32:22.382
And I Feel Like My Head Is Just About To Explode.

32:22.415 --> 32:24.684
Oh, Believe Me, Mom,
I Can Relate.

32:24.718 --> 32:26.687
Oh, Don't Call Me Mom.

32:29.355 --> 32:31.224
This Is So Radical.

32:31.257 --> 32:32.492
There's A Channel
On Your Tv

32:32.526 --> 32:35.062
That Plays Nothing
But Rock And Soul Music.

32:35.094 --> 32:37.230
Have You Seen It?

32:37.264 --> 32:40.635
Yeah, Norton.
Welcome To The World.

32:40.668 --> 32:43.237
I Completely Dig It.

32:51.411 --> 32:54.081
Sounding Good, My Man,
Sounding Very Good.

32:54.113 --> 32:56.450
Recording Yourself So You
Can Learn From The Playback.

32:56.482 --> 32:59.286
Mondo Smart, Dude.

32:59.319 --> 33:00.253
Ready For The Audition?

33:00.286 --> 33:02.190
Today?

33:00.286 --> 33:02.190
Duh.

33:02.222 --> 33:03.723
That's Today?

33:03.757 --> 33:05.226
Uh... Uh...

33:05.258 --> 33:07.327
Colin, I Just Can't.
Ok? I Can't.

33:07.361 --> 33:08.796
These Guys Aren't
Gonna Wait For You.

33:08.828 --> 33:11.164
I Mean, What Are You Thinking?
It's Today.

33:11.198 --> 33:12.767
3:00.

33:12.799 --> 33:15.302
And You Better
Be Amazing.

33:18.538 --> 33:22.676
Just Because
I Got A 79 On My Psats

33:22.709 --> 33:24.377
Doesn't Mean
I'm A College Professor.

33:24.411 --> 33:27.614
I Mean, I Don't Know Zip
About Any Of This Stuff.

33:27.648 --> 33:29.083
Obviously.

33:29.115 --> 33:31.117
I Understand
More Than You Do, Norton.

33:31.151 --> 33:32.286
Huh. You Wish.

33:32.318 --> 33:34.055
I Know.
Now, I Can Make Out

33:34.087 --> 33:35.655
What Some Of Those
Equations Are About,

33:35.689 --> 33:38.459
And I Totally Get The Concept Of Time's Arrow.

33:38.491 --> 33:40.060
Duh! Who Wouldn't?

33:40.094 --> 33:42.263
Us.

33:40.094 --> 33:42.263
Us.

33:43.564 --> 33:44.765
Which Is Why
We Were Kind Of Hoping

33:44.797 --> 33:46.366
You Two Could
Work Together On This.

33:46.400 --> 33:49.103
Yeah, Well,
It's About His Attitude.

33:49.135 --> 33:50.171
Norton Thinks
He's Too Good

33:50.203 --> 33:51.571
To Ever
Need A Partner.

33:51.604 --> 33:52.772
Oh, I'm Not
The One Who Made

33:52.806 --> 33:55.508
The Whole 9th-Grade
Chemistry Class Barf

33:55.542 --> 33:58.079
Because She Made
An Accidental Stink Bomb

33:58.112 --> 34:00.715
Because She Wouldn't
Ask For Help.

34:00.748 --> 34:02.616
Well, Excuse Me.

34:02.650 --> 34:03.751
Can We Just
Talk About The Time

34:03.784 --> 34:05.486
You Melted
Mr. Schiller's Belt

34:05.519 --> 34:06.787
'Cause You Wouldn't
Let Me Show You

34:06.820 --> 34:08.755
How To Use The New
Bunsen Burner?

34:09.590 --> 34:12.360
Guys, Can We Just
Call A Truce Here?

34:12.391 --> 34:13.693
Why Don't You
Ask Her?

34:13.726 --> 34:15.695
She's The One
Who Started It.

34:15.728 --> 34:17.364
I Did Not!

34:29.141 --> 34:31.277
Do You Guys Have
A Bathroom Down Here?

34:31.311 --> 34:33.545
It's In The Back Corner.

34:34.614 --> 34:37.516
Come With Me. Ok?
Please? Right Now.

34:37.550 --> 34:39.253
There They Go.

34:39.286 --> 34:42.222
You Ever Notice How They Go
To The Bathroom In Pairs?

34:42.255 --> 34:44.257
It's Like A Girl's
Noah's Ark.

34:44.291 --> 34:45.793
Hee Hee Hee Hee!

34:46.827 --> 34:48.262
I Don't Get It.

34:48.295 --> 34:50.297
I Mean,
I Just Don't Get It.

34:50.331 --> 34:52.666
I Mean, Why Does He
Make Me Feel Like This?

34:52.699 --> 34:56.670
My Face, It Gets All Hot,
And My Knees Go All Gooey.

34:56.704 --> 34:58.439
Because You Two
Are Way In Love.

34:58.472 --> 35:00.508
Tch. Try Way In Hate.

35:00.541 --> 35:02.843
Norton, He Just Feels
So Threatened By Me,

35:02.876 --> 35:04.245
And His Mom, Oh, His Mom,

35:04.278 --> 35:06.147
She Totally
Can't Stand Me.

35:06.179 --> 35:07.681
Yeah, Well, That
Hasn't Really Changed,

35:07.715 --> 35:09.784
But You've
Gotten Used To It.

35:09.816 --> 35:11.251
I Don't Even Know
What I'm Thinking.

35:11.284 --> 35:13.520
I Can't Get Serious
About A Boy Now.

35:13.554 --> 35:16.389
I Mean, I've Got
My Whole Life Ahead Of Me.

35:16.423 --> 35:17.458
Yeah.

35:17.490 --> 35:20.161
A Life With Norton.

35:20.193 --> 35:22.195
Oh! Uh-Uh.

35:22.228 --> 35:23.229
No, No.
Uh-Uh, Uh-Uh.

35:23.264 --> 35:25.666
It Is Just Too Crazy To Think That Norton Ballard

35:25.699 --> 35:27.767
Is The Guy
That I End Up With.

35:27.800 --> 35:30.438
Well, You Better
Get Over It, Because He Is.

35:32.606 --> 35:33.908
This Is Just So Unfair.

35:33.941 --> 35:35.843
It's Just So Unfair.

35:35.876 --> 35:37.278
What?

35:37.311 --> 35:39.847
It's Just...

35:39.880 --> 35:41.349
Being Our Age

35:41.382 --> 35:43.450
And Wanting To,
You Know,

35:43.483 --> 35:46.286
Be Cool And In Control,

35:46.320 --> 35:48.889
When All The Time,
What You Really Feel Is...

35:50.557 --> 35:53.627
Just Lost, Like,
All The Time.

35:55.295 --> 35:56.262
Whoa.

35:56.295 --> 35:58.665
What?

36:00.666 --> 36:02.902
Why Are You
Looking At Me Like That?

36:02.936 --> 36:05.206
Oh, My Gosh, Do I Have
A Booger Or Something?

36:05.238 --> 36:07.974
It's Just... I'm Blown Away.

36:08.008 --> 36:10.945
I Mean, I Had No Idea
You Felt This Stuff.

36:10.978 --> 36:14.315
And I Can't Believe
You're Sharing It With <I>Me.

36:14.347 --> 36:16.550
Well, Why Not?

36:16.583 --> 36:17.952
I Think You're Great.

36:17.985 --> 36:21.255
And The Truth Is,
I Feel...

36:21.287 --> 36:23.791
I Feel Like I Could
Talk To You For Hours.

36:25.793 --> 36:28.229
Would It Be Ok
If I Gave You A Hug?

36:30.463 --> 36:32.666
Yeah, 'Cause
I Could Definitely

36:32.699 --> 36:34.769
Use One
Right About Now.

36:36.603 --> 36:38.505
Me, Too.

36:36.603 --> 36:38.505
Ok.

36:41.340 --> 36:43.411
I Think You're
So Cool, Marie.

36:43.443 --> 36:46.947
I Think You're Cooler.

36:53.820 --> 36:55.288
Eddie?

36:55.322 --> 36:56.457
Norton?

36:56.490 --> 36:57.558
Where'd They Go?

37:04.965 --> 37:06.300
Eddie!

37:08.434 --> 37:09.402
Dad?

37:09.436 --> 37:10.671
Norton...

37:12.539 --> 37:14.374
Since When Do You
Play Guitar?

37:14.407 --> 37:16.810
He's Always
Played The Guitar.

37:16.844 --> 37:19.380
Check Him Out, Marie.
He Is Phat.

37:19.412 --> 37:21.048
I'm Not Fat.
I'm Big-Boned.

37:21.081 --> 37:22.682
You Could Certainly
Teach Me A Thing Or Two.

37:22.715 --> 37:25.552
<I>Excelente.
I Would Love To.

37:25.586 --> 37:28.823
See, I Got This Audition
Of A Lifetime

37:28.856 --> 37:31.392
To Try Out For This Tight Band Called Urban Slugs,

37:31.425 --> 37:32.827
And Norton's Helping Me
Get Ready For It.

37:32.860 --> 37:34.461
Hey, What's The Deal?

37:34.494 --> 37:36.663
How Come Your Skateboard
Has A Handle?

37:36.697 --> 37:39.934
Have You Forgotten About Our Little Problem Here?

37:39.967 --> 37:41.602
No, Not At All.

37:41.635 --> 37:43.037
See, Here's What
I'm Thinking.

37:43.070 --> 37:45.639
Since Mom And Dad Always
Want To Fight About Everything,

37:45.671 --> 37:46.639
Maybe It Would
Make More Sense

37:46.673 --> 37:48.976
For You To Go Down In The Lab And Work With Mom,

37:49.008 --> 37:51.411
And I Stay Up Here And Keep An Eye On Dad.

37:51.445 --> 37:53.847
Or In Other Words,
Dump The Tough Stuff On My Shoulders

37:53.880 --> 37:56.416
So You Can Hide Out With Jimi Hendrix Over There.

37:56.449 --> 37:58.985
Come On, Marie.
The Guys Are Gonna Be Here At 3:00.

37:59.019 --> 38:02.356
Yeah, And At 6:00,
There's A Good Chance We Can Be Orphans.

38:06.492 --> 38:07.961
Norton?

38:07.994 --> 38:09.529
Marigold?

38:09.563 --> 38:10.530
Where'd They Go?

38:10.563 --> 38:11.798
Oh, No.

38:12.999 --> 38:14.501
They're Not Here.
Where Could They Be?

38:14.534 --> 38:16.769
I Don't Know.
They're Not Down In The Lab.

38:16.802 --> 38:19.739
I Don't Get It.
Where Could They Possibly Have Gone?

38:27.981 --> 38:30.484
What Were They Thinking?

38:30.516 --> 38:31.985
Where Would They Go?

38:34.420 --> 38:35.822
Um, Excuse Me,
Mrs. Cook.

38:35.856 --> 38:36.624
Do You Know
Where My Parents--

38:36.657 --> 38:38.925
Oh, Marie, Dear.
What A Coincidence.

38:38.958 --> 38:40.693
I Was Just About
To Call Over To Your House.

38:40.726 --> 38:42.495
That's Great, Ms. Cook,
But I Really Need To--

38:42.528 --> 38:45.599
Apparently We're Not The Only
Ones In The Neighborhood

38:45.632 --> 38:47.735
Losing Patience
With Your Parents.

38:47.767 --> 38:49.670
Come, I Want
To Show You Something.

38:49.702 --> 38:52.539
Um, Mrs. Cook,
Right Now Really Isn't A Good Time.

38:52.572 --> 38:54.775
Would You Rather
I Spoke To Them Directly?

38:54.807 --> 38:56.043
Do You Know
Where They Are?

38:56.075 --> 38:58.144
Don't You?

39:04.016 --> 39:05.652
You Know, I Don't
Want To Sound Like

39:05.686 --> 39:06.987
<I>Twilight Zone Here
Or Anything,

39:07.019 --> 39:08.389
But Are You Starting
To Feel Like We Landed

39:08.421 --> 39:10.423
On A Totally
Different Planet?

39:10.456 --> 39:11.891
Where's My House?

39:11.925 --> 39:13.794
Where's My Tree Fort?

39:13.827 --> 39:15.429
Where's Mr. Frizzle's
Grave?

39:15.461 --> 39:16.729
Mr. Frizzle?

39:16.762 --> 39:18.065
My Lab Mouse.

39:18.097 --> 39:19.999
Whose Bright Idea
Was It To Take Away

39:20.032 --> 39:21.067
Everything I Love

39:21.101 --> 39:23.503
And Put A Stupid
Park In Its Place?

39:23.537 --> 39:24.838
You Know, Norton,
I'm Starting To Feel

39:24.871 --> 39:27.708
Like Eddie And Marie
Were Telling Us The Truth.

39:27.740 --> 39:29.043
No Way, Marigold.
That's Too Weird.

39:29.075 --> 39:32.045
Yeah, Really Weird,
But Do You Have A Better Explanation, Sherlock?

39:32.079 --> 39:33.814
I Mean, Come On.
What Are We Gonna Do Now?

39:33.847 --> 39:35.615
Our Only Real Choice
Is To Go Back To The Lab

39:35.648 --> 39:36.816
And See What
We Can Figure Out.

39:36.849 --> 39:38.084
Whoa!

39:38.117 --> 39:39.652
I Can't Believe For The First Time In My Life,

39:39.686 --> 39:41.956
I Actually
Agree With You.

39:45.825 --> 39:47.860
So, What Street
Do They Live On?

39:47.894 --> 39:50.130
Oh, Norton, Come On.
Don't You Know?

39:50.162 --> 39:51.965
No.

39:51.999 --> 39:52.967
Well, Let's Just Go Back The Way We Came From.

39:52.999 --> 39:55.101
Ok? Come On.
Come On, Let's Go.

39:56.003 --> 39:58.138
You Guys. Boys Don't
Ask For Directions.

39:58.170 --> 40:00.573
You Should Have Just
Asked For Directions, Norton!

40:00.606 --> 40:01.708
Which Way Do We Go?

40:01.742 --> 40:02.977
I Don't Know!

40:10.150 --> 40:12.586
Norton! Unh!

40:12.619 --> 40:13.653
Norton!

40:13.686 --> 40:15.154
Norton!

40:15.188 --> 40:16.690
Hey, There You Are.

40:16.722 --> 40:17.925
Where's Marigold?

40:17.958 --> 40:20.527
I Don't Know.
We Had Another Dumb Fight.

40:20.559 --> 40:22.563
We Got All Lost
Trying To Get To Your Pad,

40:22.595 --> 40:25.164
And She Got All Bugged Out,
Saying I Was Yelling At Her

40:25.197 --> 40:26.966
When I Wasn't.

40:26.999 --> 40:29.936
Nice Bike! Whoa.

40:29.970 --> 40:32.473
I Mean,
She Is So Sensitive.

40:32.505 --> 40:34.741
How Is A Guy Supposed
To Have A Relationship

40:34.775 --> 40:37.978
When Everything Turns Into A Huge Federal Case?

40:38.010 --> 40:39.579
Don't Ask Me.

40:43.949 --> 40:45.118
Unh!

40:46.219 --> 40:48.921
Whoa! Where'd You
Learn To Do That?

40:48.954 --> 40:50.690
I've Always Done This.

40:50.724 --> 40:52.992
Check This Out.
Watch This.

40:53.025 --> 40:55.228
I Wish Marigold
Could See This.

40:55.262 --> 40:56.729
She Wouldn't Believe It.

40:56.762 --> 40:59.599
Unh! Don't You
Have A Girlfriend?

41:00.666 --> 41:02.001
What's Wrong?

41:02.034 --> 41:05.605
Uh... I Think
That's The First Time

41:05.639 --> 41:07.675
You Ever Asked Me
About My Social Life.

41:07.708 --> 41:10.878
Well, If I'm Your Father,
Like You Claim,

41:10.911 --> 41:12.146
Don't We Talk?

41:12.179 --> 41:15.115
Well...

41:15.148 --> 41:16.182
Not Really.

41:16.215 --> 41:20.520
I Mean,
You're Always Sort Of Too Busy Or Whatever.

41:20.554 --> 41:22.122
Sounds Like My Father.

41:22.155 --> 41:23.691
That's A Bummer, Man.

41:23.724 --> 41:25.592
That's Not The Type
Of Father I Want To Be.

41:25.624 --> 41:28.228
Hey, Don't
Beat Yourself Up.

41:28.260 --> 41:30.764
I Mean, Your Work's
Really Important To You.

41:30.796 --> 41:32.199
Work, Schmirk.

41:33.300 --> 41:35.269
Check This Out.

41:37.037 --> 41:39.606
Up, Up, And Away.

41:39.639 --> 41:42.142
Oh, Yeah! Whoo! Ha Ha!

41:46.079 --> 41:48.649
Oh, How Could You
Do It, Girl?

41:48.682 --> 41:51.251
It's Like--Like,
Straight From My Heart

41:51.284 --> 41:53.887
And Into Your Mouth.

41:53.920 --> 41:56.023
Dang, You're Good.

42:03.162 --> 42:04.965
Mrs. Ballard...

42:06.733 --> 42:08.902
Yeah, Right.
Like That's Ever Gonna Happen.

42:08.934 --> 42:13.072
Are... You Ok?

42:13.106 --> 42:16.043
Look, No Offense, Ok?
But Do I Even Know You?

42:16.075 --> 42:19.012
I'm Cloe. I Go
To School With Marie.

42:20.079 --> 42:23.150
Listen, I Don't Mean To Sound Nosy Or Anything,

42:23.182 --> 42:25.619
But You Seem
Totally Sad.

42:25.652 --> 42:27.887
Well...

42:29.655 --> 42:31.891
Cloe, Right? Ok.

42:31.925 --> 42:33.193
I Have This Friend, Right?

42:33.226 --> 42:35.061
And She's--
She's About Our Age.

42:35.095 --> 42:36.063
And If--

42:36.095 --> 42:37.331
Does He Name
Start With An "M"?

42:37.363 --> 42:41.001
Whoa! I Mean, That Is, Like,
Absolutely Correct.

42:41.034 --> 42:42.336
Wow! You're Good.

42:42.369 --> 42:44.338
What Can I Say?
It's A Gift.

42:44.371 --> 42:47.874
So, Why Don't You
Tell Me Everything?

42:47.907 --> 42:50.243
There's Nothing Like
An Emotional Purge

42:50.277 --> 42:52.780
To Make You Feel
1,000 % Better.

42:55.115 --> 42:56.717
Can I Buy You
Another Drink?

42:57.851 --> 42:59.619
You Know, Your Eyes, Like,
Totally Match Your Sweater?

42:59.653 --> 43:01.722
That Is, Like, So Cool.

43:01.755 --> 43:04.925
This We Lost
In Yesterday's Explosion.

43:04.958 --> 43:08.628
Come Here.
Look At This, Marie.

43:08.662 --> 43:12.166
This Was From One Of Their Experiments A Week Ago.

43:12.199 --> 43:14.767
And The Longmans
Lost A Pair

43:14.800 --> 43:16.769
Of Precious
Lawn Gnomes.

43:16.802 --> 43:20.007
The Robergs' Crystal Chandelier Is In A Shambles,

43:20.039 --> 43:22.375
The Franzens Claim
That Their Dog

43:22.409 --> 43:25.646
Has Lost
All Bladder Control.

43:25.679 --> 43:27.981
Obviously, We Realize
It's Not Your Fault

43:28.014 --> 43:29.048
That Your Parents
Are, Uh...

43:29.081 --> 43:31.250
A Little Eccentric?

43:31.284 --> 43:33.787
Well, I Was Going To Say <I>Freaks,
But That's Ok.

43:33.820 --> 43:37.024
Nonetheless, Corky Has Started A Petition,

43:37.057 --> 43:39.660
And More Than Half The
Neighborhood Has Already Signed It.

43:39.693 --> 43:42.196
A Petition For What?

43:42.228 --> 43:45.431
Unless They
Cease And Desist

43:45.465 --> 43:47.700
Operating
A Scientific Lab

43:47.733 --> 43:49.202
In A Residential
Neighborhood,

43:49.235 --> 43:51.737
We'll Bring Out
A County Inspector...

43:51.771 --> 43:54.208
And File A Motion
To Have Your Family Evicted.

43:54.240 --> 43:57.443
What? But You Can't.

43:57.476 --> 44:01.380
I Mean, Not Now.
Definitely, Oh, Not Now.

44:01.414 --> 44:04.450
You See, They're...

44:07.019 --> 44:09.422
Look, Whatever You Think
You Have To Do,

44:09.456 --> 44:10.891
You Just Can't
Do It Today.

44:10.923 --> 44:12.892
Believe Me. Please.

44:17.063 --> 44:19.432
It's Just So Bizarre,
Because Marie Hasn't Said Anything

44:19.465 --> 44:21.334
About Having
Some Huge Crush.

44:21.367 --> 44:24.203
I Bet It's Colin.
He's There All The Time With Eddie.

44:24.237 --> 44:25.771
He's Really Cute.

44:28.275 --> 44:30.443
Uh, Cloe,
I Think You Just Ran Over About Half A Town.

44:30.476 --> 44:32.045
Oh, You Are Toast.

44:32.077 --> 44:33.246
Oops. My Bad.

44:33.280 --> 44:34.414
So, This Other Thing.

44:34.447 --> 44:35.849
Mrs. B. Told Me
That The Urban Slugs

44:35.882 --> 44:37.450
Are Playing Over
At Their House Later.

44:37.483 --> 44:38.251
Really?

44:38.284 --> 44:40.319
Yeah, It Sounded Like
She Was Hoping

44:40.353 --> 44:42.789
It Was Gonna Turn Into Some Huge Graduation Party.

44:42.822 --> 44:45.157
Which Means We Should
Start Inviting Kids.

44:45.191 --> 44:47.361
Ok. We'll Go Get
The Guys At The Counter.

44:47.394 --> 44:50.796
And I'll Start
Doing My Phone Thing.

44:54.833 --> 44:56.903
So, With Less Than 6 Hours
Left Until Poof Point,

44:56.936 --> 44:59.839
Dad And I Did What Anyone
Facing Oblivion Would Do.

44:59.873 --> 45:01.909
We Jammed.

45:38.545 --> 45:41.280
Um, Forgive Me Once Again For
Being The Voice Of Sanity Here,

45:41.313 --> 45:44.116
But... Where's Marigold?

45:47.086 --> 45:49.355
Excuse Me.

45:47.086 --> 45:49.355
What The--

45:51.858 --> 45:52.659
Ooh.

45:52.691 --> 45:54.494
How Do You Like That,
Norton Ballard?

45:54.527 --> 45:57.798
Oh, Um... Uh...

45:57.831 --> 45:59.231
Mom, What's Up
With That?

45:59.264 --> 46:01.867
It's Time I Started
Acting Like A Modern Woman,

46:01.900 --> 46:04.270
According
To Your Friend Cloe.

46:04.304 --> 46:05.439
Cloe?

46:05.472 --> 46:06.974
Cloe Weber
Is The Meanest,

46:07.007 --> 46:08.874
Most Gossipy Girl
In Our Whole Class.

46:08.907 --> 46:11.177
Well, Didn't She Think
It Was Kind Of Weird

46:11.211 --> 46:13.280
That Our Mom Was Acting
Like She Was 14?

46:13.313 --> 46:15.916
Well, Cloe Was Very Clear That These Days,

46:15.949 --> 46:18.584
If A Girl
Really Wants Something,

46:18.617 --> 46:20.886
She Does Not Have
To Sit Around And Wait

46:20.920 --> 46:24.124
For The Boy To Make
The First Move. So...

46:24.157 --> 46:25.325
What The Heck...

46:25.358 --> 46:26.959
What Do You Say, Norty?

46:26.992 --> 46:28.327
About What?

46:28.360 --> 46:30.998
Norton Ballard...

46:31.030 --> 46:32.532
Will You
Go Steady With Me?

46:35.334 --> 46:37.470
Come On.
We Need To Get Back To The Lab.

46:37.503 --> 46:40.072
Norton, I Know
You're In Here.

46:40.106 --> 46:43.010
Norton, You're
Being Ridiculous.

46:43.978 --> 46:45.345
Well, You Don't
Know What It's Like.

46:45.378 --> 46:46.479
You Don't
Have A Girlfriend.

46:46.512 --> 46:48.547
You Don't Know
How It Feels.

46:48.581 --> 46:51.017
Nobody Knows How I Feel!

46:51.050 --> 46:53.353
Gee, Haven't Heard
That One Since...

46:53.385 --> 46:55.188
Yesterday,
When I Said It.

46:57.222 --> 46:58.624
The Countdown Clock
Doesn't Care

46:58.657 --> 47:00.360
About Any Of This.
It's Ticking.

47:00.392 --> 47:02.128
Look, I'm Sorry
If You're Gonna

47:02.162 --> 47:04.064
Have To Put Your Little
Anxiety Attack On Hold,

47:04.097 --> 47:06.233
But It's Getting
Really Crucial Here.

47:06.266 --> 47:08.200
I'm A Teenager.

47:08.233 --> 47:10.536
This Is Supposed To Be
The Best Time Of My Life,

47:10.570 --> 47:13.073
And All I'm Feeling
Is Pressure.

47:13.106 --> 47:15.441
And I Can't Handle It!

47:15.474 --> 47:17.076
You're Not The Only One

47:17.110 --> 47:19.112
That's Having A Little Bit Of Trouble With This!

47:19.144 --> 47:22.114
Being 14
Has Never Been Easy.

47:22.148 --> 47:23.617
Ask Any Of My Friends.

47:23.650 --> 47:26.286
But You Have To Come Out
And Deal With It.

47:28.387 --> 47:30.257
Ok. I'll Come Out.

47:30.289 --> 47:32.324
Thank You.

47:34.527 --> 47:36.262
Ok, You Can
Handle This.

47:36.295 --> 47:38.130
I Know You Can
Handle This.

47:38.164 --> 47:40.033
It's Just
Some Dumb Girl.

47:40.066 --> 47:42.402
A Dumb Girl Can't
Tell You What To Do.

47:42.434 --> 47:45.072
Dumb Girl. Girl, Girl.

47:45.104 --> 47:48.307
No! No, No!
I Can't! I Can't!

47:48.340 --> 47:50.911
What If I Can't
Figure Out The Formula?

47:50.943 --> 47:53.146
I've Been Only
Programmed For Success.

47:53.179 --> 47:56.516
The Fear Of Failing Flips Me Out!
I Can't! No!

47:58.217 --> 48:00.219
Man, You Got To Stop
Stealing My Lines.

48:03.623 --> 48:05.425
Whoa!

48:05.458 --> 48:08.028
I Don't Believe It.

48:08.061 --> 48:11.264
How Did This Get Down Here?

48:11.296 --> 48:14.101
Did Norton Finish This
Without Me?

48:14.133 --> 48:16.503
I Don't Know. You Know,
It's Been Here Forever.

48:16.536 --> 48:19.238
You Know,
I Think It's Just Some Old Project Of Yours.

48:19.271 --> 48:21.407
It's An Energy Ball.

48:21.441 --> 48:24.611
We're Working On It For Next Year's Science Fair.

48:24.644 --> 48:26.313
Isn't This Wild?

48:26.345 --> 48:27.414
What Does It Do?

48:27.447 --> 48:28.981
Well,
That's The Problem.

48:29.014 --> 48:30.217
We Spend So Much
Time Arguing,

48:30.249 --> 48:32.985
We Never Seem
To Get It Done.

48:33.019 --> 48:34.154
Where's Norton?

48:34.186 --> 48:36.355
In The Greenhouse,
Having A Godzilla-Sized

48:36.389 --> 48:38.525
Nervous Breakdown.

48:38.557 --> 48:41.494
It's All About Me,
Right?

48:41.528 --> 48:42.463
I Knew It.
I Knew It.

48:42.496 --> 48:45.365
I Knew I Should Never
Have Been So Aggressive.

48:45.398 --> 48:49.302
Eddie, Please Tell Her
She's Being Ridiculous.

48:49.334 --> 48:51.972
Well... He Did Say

48:52.005 --> 48:53.606
That Every Time He Pictures Her Looking At Him,

48:53.639 --> 48:56.175
He Feels Like
Throwing Up.

48:56.208 --> 48:59.311
I Realized That The Only Way
To Get Them Back On Track

48:59.345 --> 49:01.615
Was To Do To Them What Mom
And Dad Do To Me And My Sister

49:01.648 --> 49:02.950
When We Go At It.

49:02.983 --> 49:06.653
I Sat Them Down And Told Them That
No One Was Gonna Leave The Room

49:06.686 --> 49:08.755
Until They Had
A Compromise.

49:08.787 --> 49:11.525
And, Much To My Surprise...

49:11.557 --> 49:13.360
It Actually Worked.

49:14.226 --> 49:15.194
I Got It!

49:15.228 --> 49:16.496
No, I Got It!

49:16.528 --> 49:19.365
Ignition Sequence
Plus Delta "X"

49:19.398 --> 49:20.766
Added To "X" Squared.

49:20.800 --> 49:22.635
Same Theory As The Fuel-Injection Rocket

49:22.668 --> 49:24.036
We Made
In Seventh Grade.

49:24.070 --> 49:26.506
Oh! Are You Really Sure
You Figured It Out?

49:26.539 --> 49:27.707
This Is Amazing.

49:27.740 --> 49:29.242
Are You Sure
It'll Work?

49:29.275 --> 49:30.209
Well, We Did
Send A Hamster

49:30.242 --> 49:32.578
Soaring Over A Minimarket Using This Equation.

49:32.612 --> 49:34.681
It Couldn't Be
That Different.

49:36.416 --> 49:38.017
It's All Set.
Just Push "Enter."

49:38.050 --> 49:40.452
Transmission Code Loaded.

49:40.485 --> 49:42.288
Press "Enter."

49:42.322 --> 49:44.257
Wait Up! Wa-Wait.

49:44.289 --> 49:45.425
Are You Guys
Sure About This?

49:45.458 --> 49:48.094
Eddie, Nothing
In Science Is Sure.

49:48.126 --> 49:50.130
That's What Makes It
Interesting.

49:50.162 --> 49:53.099
Specimen Ready
For Time Retrieval.

49:53.132 --> 49:54.467
All Right.

49:57.537 --> 50:01.241
10, 9, 8,

50:01.273 --> 50:05.110
7, 6, 5,

50:05.144 --> 50:10.350
4, 3, 2, 1...

50:10.383 --> 50:13.420
Time's Arrow
Machine Engaged.

50:13.452 --> 50:15.755
Prepare For Departure.

50:15.787 --> 50:19.159
Passage Through Time.

50:23.662 --> 50:25.632
Resident Location Annulled.

50:25.664 --> 50:28.067
Oh, No, Eddie.
You Poofed Them.

50:28.101 --> 50:29.769
Me? All I Did
Was Push "Enter."

50:29.802 --> 50:31.371
What Are We
Gonna Do Now?

50:31.403 --> 50:34.407
Ok.
Ok, Maybe If We Enter All Those Numbers Again,

50:34.440 --> 50:35.642
Maybe They'll
Come Back Or Something.

50:35.675 --> 50:37.510
Are You Kidding?
If They Couldn't Make It,

50:37.543 --> 50:39.246
Well, We're Not Going To.

50:39.278 --> 50:41.414
Ok, When I Make
Mistakes On My Homework,

50:41.447 --> 50:42.515
I Just Push "Undo."

50:42.548 --> 50:43.683
Eddie,
This Isn't Homework.

50:43.715 --> 50:45.784
This Is A Complicated
Scientific--

50:47.820 --> 50:51.124
Resident Location.
Discus Shutting Down.

50:51.157 --> 50:52.258
Mom!

50:51.157 --> 50:52.258
Dad!

50:52.291 --> 50:55.194
Ignition Sequence
Plus Delta "X"

50:55.228 --> 50:56.563
Added To "X" Squared.

50:56.595 --> 50:58.231
Same Theory As The Fuel-Injection Rocket

50:58.264 --> 51:00.300
We Made
In Seventh Grade.

51:01.700 --> 51:04.304
Are You Guys Ok?

51:04.336 --> 51:05.304
Well, We Did
Send A Hamster

51:05.338 --> 51:06.373
Soaring Over
A Minimarket

51:06.405 --> 51:07.474
Using This Equation.

51:07.507 --> 51:08.807
Shouldn't Be
That Different.

51:08.840 --> 51:11.110
It's All Set.
Just Push "Enter."

51:11.144 --> 51:13.346
Whoa, Wait!

51:13.378 --> 51:17.383
We Just Did This,
And It Didn't Work.

51:20.052 --> 51:23.322
Oh, No. It's 3:00.
My Audition!

51:23.356 --> 51:25.592
What?! Eddie, You Can't
Have An Audition Now!

51:25.624 --> 51:26.592
I Know, But--

51:26.626 --> 51:28.128
Forget It, Eddie.
Get Rid Of Them.

51:32.298 --> 51:34.734
Whoo!

51:39.706 --> 51:41.708
It's Party Time.

51:41.740 --> 51:44.510
Back Off. Back Off. Ok?

51:44.543 --> 51:47.246
Just Give Me One Minute
To Talk To Him.

51:47.280 --> 51:50.182
Dude, What's With
The Door-Slam Drama?

51:50.215 --> 51:51.284
Got Anything To Drink?

51:51.316 --> 51:53.719
Hey, You Said I Was Having An Audition,
Not A Rave!

51:53.753 --> 51:55.255
What Is Everyone
Doing Out There?

51:55.287 --> 51:56.255
We Didn't Invite Them.

51:56.289 --> 51:57.324
Who Did?

51:57.356 --> 51:58.557
How Should I Know?

51:58.590 --> 51:59.558
But It Looks Like
It's Gonna Be

51:59.592 --> 52:01.227
A Rockin' Party, Man.

52:01.260 --> 52:03.396
The Purdy Twins Have Got A
Couple Of Cases Of Root Beer.

52:03.429 --> 52:04.363
Help Yourself.

52:04.396 --> 52:06.932
Amber's Hauling In Humongous Bags Of Popcorn.

52:06.965 --> 52:09.902
Wow! As Thrilling
As That Sounds, Colin,

52:09.936 --> 52:11.638
We Are Not Having
A Party Here!

52:11.670 --> 52:14.406
What Are All
These People Doing Here?

52:14.440 --> 52:16.409
It Sounds Like There's
A Million Kids Outside.

52:16.441 --> 52:18.545
Oh, No Worries.
I Only Counted 132.

52:18.577 --> 52:22.514
Hey, Marie,
You're Looking Pretty Pretty Today.

52:24.516 --> 52:26.251
Eddie, What Are All
These People Doing Here?

52:26.284 --> 52:27.886
You Tell Me,
And Then We'll Both Know.

52:27.920 --> 52:29.622
Where Should We Be
Setting Up All The Equipment?

52:29.655 --> 52:32.292
Uh, Backyard.
You Can Use The Patio For Our Stage.

52:32.324 --> 52:34.360
Uh, No. No.

52:34.394 --> 52:36.262
No Stage, No Band,

52:36.295 --> 52:39.398
No Equipment,
No 132 Crashers,

52:39.432 --> 52:40.500
No Party.

52:40.532 --> 52:43.369
Look, Tell Him.
I Just Live Here.

52:43.403 --> 52:45.805
Maybe You Should Think About
Getting A Little Warmup, Dude.

52:45.838 --> 52:48.541
And I'll Be Saving A Spot For You Right Up Front.

52:48.574 --> 52:52.545
Kids, Chanting:
Party! Party! Party!

52:52.577 --> 52:54.880
Am I Losing My Mind,
Or Was He Just Flirting With You?

52:54.914 --> 52:56.416
Both.

53:10.362 --> 53:12.398
If Only That Stupid
Time Machine Was Working,

53:12.432 --> 53:14.801
I'd Be Sending Myself
Back To Last Week.

53:14.833 --> 53:16.402
You Know--

53:29.849 --> 53:32.552
Wow. What A Rush.

53:36.856 --> 53:38.425
Well, We Figured Out
The Problem.

53:38.458 --> 53:40.994
It Definitely Has To Do
With The Machine.

53:41.027 --> 53:42.561
You Ok?

53:42.595 --> 53:44.030
Yeah, I'm Good.

53:58.811 --> 54:02.615
Â™ª I Don't Remember You
In Class Last Week â™ª

54:02.648 --> 54:06.385
â™ª And You're The One
That Had To Feel This Way â™ª

54:12.758 --> 54:15.829
I Think We Should Compare
What's In The Design Drawings

54:15.862 --> 54:17.963
To What Actually
Made It Into The Machine

54:17.996 --> 54:20.866
And See If They Match Up.

54:20.900 --> 54:22.568
Cool. Go For It.

54:22.601 --> 54:23.735
Great.

54:26.738 --> 54:27.907
Norton...

54:28.673 --> 54:30.543
Norton!
Pay Attention, Please!

54:30.575 --> 54:32.411
Hello?

54:32.445 --> 54:34.581
Is Anyone Down Here?

54:35.414 --> 54:36.782
Um, This Is, Like,
A Really Bad Idea,

54:36.816 --> 54:38.017
Coming Down Here
Right Now, So...

54:38.050 --> 54:39.786
Let's Just Go Back
To The Party. Ok?

54:39.818 --> 54:43.655
I Can't Have This Party Going On Today.
It's A Disaster.

54:43.688 --> 54:46.425
Why Not? Cloe Gave Us
The Exciting Scoop.

54:46.458 --> 54:47.926
Aren't You Dying?

54:47.959 --> 54:49.095
What Are You
Talking About?

54:49.128 --> 54:51.331
You And Colin.
Cloe Says That He Likes You,

54:51.363 --> 54:53.800
And You Like Him.
It's So Cool.

54:53.833 --> 54:55.068
Where'd She
Get That Idea?

54:55.101 --> 54:56.669
From Your Mother.

54:57.537 --> 54:59.572
I Knew It. I Knew It.

54:59.604 --> 55:00.907
You Don't Like Him?

55:00.940 --> 55:02.976
Too Bad.
He Acted All Pumped When He Found Out.

55:03.008 --> 55:05.077
He Was?

55:07.813 --> 55:10.816
Ok. No. I Cannot
Deal With This Right Now.

55:10.849 --> 55:13.552
We're Down To Less Than 3 Hours Until Poof Point.

55:13.586 --> 55:14.587
What Point?

55:14.619 --> 55:16.889
Oh, Forget It.

55:16.923 --> 55:19.425
So, Uh, On This One,
We Want You To Sort Of Play Along,

55:19.458 --> 55:20.827
Get Yourself Into It,

55:20.860 --> 55:22.061
And Then We'll Set You
Up For A Bass Solo,

55:22.095 --> 55:24.531
And, Uh,
We'll Give You A Chance To Show Us What You've Got.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.002
Sound Cool?

55:25.034 --> 55:26.036
I Guess.

55:26.069 --> 55:27.070
All Right,
Ready, Guys?

55:27.103 --> 55:28.471
You Guys
Ready To Rock?

55:28.505 --> 55:29.974
All Right. Let's Do It.

56:05.442 --> 56:08.478
Â™ª Woke Up With
That Empty Feeling â™ª

56:08.511 --> 56:11.214
â™ª In My Head â™ª

56:11.248 --> 56:14.118
This Is Clear
And Utter Defiance.

56:14.150 --> 56:16.052
I Warned Marie
About Her Parents,

56:16.085 --> 56:18.121
And What Does She Do?
She Throws A Huge Party.

56:18.154 --> 56:19.422
Those Ballards
Are All Alike--

56:19.456 --> 56:22.059
Not One Iota
Of Respect For Others.

56:22.092 --> 56:23.560
Should We
Go Over There?

56:23.592 --> 56:25.495
I Think We Should
Call The Police.

56:25.529 --> 56:28.065
All I Can Say
Is That I'm Very Glad

56:28.098 --> 56:29.599
That Our Lizzie
Isn't The Type Of Child

56:29.632 --> 56:31.435
Who Would Ever Even
Want To Be A Part

56:31.467 --> 56:33.404
Of Such Blatant
Hooliganism!

56:33.436 --> 56:34.605
Ooh!

57:01.130 --> 57:02.433
Norton,
What Are You Doing?

57:02.465 --> 57:03.601
You Have
To Concentrate.

57:03.634 --> 57:06.170
What's The Point?
It's Not Like We're Getting Anywhere.

57:06.203 --> 57:09.038
I Want To Be Up With The Other Kids.
I Want To Party!

57:09.072 --> 57:10.307
Whoo! Ha Ha!

57:10.340 --> 57:11.475
No, See, First Of All,

57:11.507 --> 57:15.511
There Wasn't Supposed
To Be A Stupid Party.

57:15.545 --> 57:16.646
Well, Why Are You Acting Like It's My Fault?

57:16.679 --> 57:19.248
Because You Were The One
Who Told Cloe To Organize It.

57:19.282 --> 57:20.417
Oh, No,
I Didn't.

57:20.449 --> 57:22.218
Does It Really Matter?
Look, They're Here,

57:22.252 --> 57:24.288
They Don't Want
To Leave, And...

57:25.489 --> 57:26.924
We're Running Out Of Time.

57:26.956 --> 57:28.659
That's All The Reason
We Should Be Partying!

57:28.692 --> 57:30.060
Oh, So You're
Gonna Give Up?

57:30.092 --> 57:31.627
Like We Got A Choice.

57:31.661 --> 57:33.329
You Do. You Have To!

57:33.362 --> 57:34.598
Hold On.

57:34.630 --> 57:36.433
Look, Nobody Panic.

57:36.465 --> 57:39.002
Nobody Leave.
I Got To Go Get Eddie.

57:49.980 --> 57:50.947
Hey, Marie...

57:50.980 --> 57:52.081
Lizzie!

57:52.116 --> 57:54.485
You Know,
You Act Like You're Some Big Friend Of Mine,

57:54.518 --> 57:56.086
And Then You Go
Throw Some Huge Party

57:56.119 --> 57:58.422
And Don't Even Bother
To Invite Me.

57:58.454 --> 58:01.190
Look, There Wasn't Even
Supposed To Be A Stupid Party.

58:01.224 --> 58:03.060
It Was My Mother's Idea.

58:03.092 --> 58:04.560
Your Mom's?

58:04.594 --> 58:05.462
Look, If You're
Gonna Blow Me Off,

58:05.494 --> 58:07.498
You Can At Least Come Up
With A Better Lie.

58:07.531 --> 58:08.965
Look, Can We
Deal With This Later?

58:08.998 --> 58:11.201
'Cause I Really Need
To Go Talk To Eddie.

58:12.268 --> 58:15.171
And Besides, I Happen
To Be Telling You The Truth.

58:15.204 --> 58:17.040
Really?

58:18.074 --> 58:19.576
That's So Cool.

58:19.608 --> 58:21.344
My Parents Would Never
Let Me Have A Party.

58:21.378 --> 58:24.114
They'd Be Too Afraid Someone
Might Mess Up Their Perfect House

58:24.146 --> 58:25.715
Or Ruin
Their Perfect Lawn.

58:25.748 --> 58:29.352
Do You Know How Sick To Death
I Am Of Trying To Be Perfect?!

58:32.322 --> 58:34.625
Let Me Guess. Really Sick?

58:34.657 --> 58:37.261
So Sick, There Isn't
A Doctor On The Planet

58:37.293 --> 58:38.462
That Could Cure Me.

58:40.496 --> 58:42.732
Well, Look, If You Want To Go To The Party,
I Mean, You Can.

58:42.766 --> 58:44.268
Really?

58:45.101 --> 58:47.171
Thanks.

58:49.639 --> 58:51.275
Marie, Norton Did It!

58:51.308 --> 58:53.310
He Found A Part That's Supposed To Be In The Machine,

58:53.342 --> 58:54.143
And It's Not.

58:54.177 --> 58:56.547
It's Described In Detail
In The Notes.

58:56.579 --> 58:57.581
There's Even
A Scale Drawing,

58:57.614 --> 58:58.782
But It's Not
In The Machine.

58:58.815 --> 59:00.284
Yeah!

59:00.317 --> 59:01.585
So, Do You Think
That's What Set Off

59:01.618 --> 59:03.719
The Whole De-Aging Deal
In The First Place?

59:03.753 --> 59:05.122
Maybe. All We Have To Do

59:05.154 --> 59:07.590
Is Find The Missing Piece,
Put It In Its Place,

59:07.623 --> 59:09.425
Re-Enter The Equations,

59:09.458 --> 59:11.161
And Then We--

59:13.195 --> 59:14.163
And What?

59:14.197 --> 59:15.332
More Hiccups.

59:15.364 --> 59:17.033
And You Know
What That Means.

59:18.467 --> 59:19.469
Marigold,
What Was He Gonna Tell Us?

59:19.502 --> 59:21.103
What Was He Trying To Say?

59:21.136 --> 59:23.039
He Just Wants Us To--

59:23.072 --> 59:25.141
Oh, No. Mom!
Not--Not You, Too.

59:25.174 --> 59:26.542
Mom, No.

59:27.476 --> 59:31.415
Wow. Trippin'.

59:31.447 --> 59:32.683
Ok, Uh, Get Back
To The Lab, You Guys.

59:32.715 --> 59:34.317
Come On. Both Of You.
Now. Come On.

59:34.351 --> 59:36.220
And I'm Gonna--
I Got To Go Get Eddie.

59:42.192 --> 59:44.728
Gotta Say, Ballard,
That Actually Didn't Reek.

59:46.762 --> 59:49.465
Uh, Eddie--House-- Disaster--More--

59:49.498 --> 59:51.201
Need Me To Get You
A Glass Of Water?

59:51.233 --> 59:53.069
No, Uh...

59:53.103 --> 59:54.471
I Need You To Come
To The Lab, Eddie.

59:54.503 --> 59:57.241
Marie, Give Me 5 Or 10 More Minutes.
It's An Emergency.

59:57.273 --> 59:58.241
Is This
How It's Gonna Be

59:58.275 --> 59:59.509
When We Let You
Into The Band?

59:59.541 --> 01:00:01.411
Every Day,
Another Emergency?

01:00:01.444 --> 01:00:03.579
No! Ha Ha!
You See, Trust Me.

01:00:03.612 --> 01:00:06.449
Um, See, This Emergency
Only Can Happen Once.

01:00:06.482 --> 01:00:08.818
Eddie Is
Totally Dependable.

01:00:08.851 --> 01:00:10.686
He Is Also
A Great Musician.

01:00:10.719 --> 01:00:13.189
Gee, Marie.
Thanks.

01:00:13.223 --> 01:00:14.824
Beep-Beep,
Beep-Beep-Beep-Beep!

01:00:14.857 --> 01:00:17.260
Whee! Whee!

01:00:17.293 --> 01:00:18.427
Rrrrrr...

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:20.464
Nothing
Ruins A Party More

01:00:20.496 --> 01:00:22.465
Than Having
27-Year-Olds Run Amuck,

01:00:22.498 --> 01:00:25.167
Especially
When They're Your Parents.

01:00:41.418 --> 01:00:44.288
What Is It Doing?
Oh, My Gosh!

01:00:46.790 --> 01:00:48.324
Excellent.

01:00:50.293 --> 01:00:51.461
Whoa!

01:01:09.244 --> 01:01:11.748
My Turn! My Turn!

01:01:11.781 --> 01:01:14.351
No! Not In The House!

01:01:14.384 --> 01:01:16.552
I Just Want You To Know Your
Mother Is My Total Role Model.

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:19.222
Cut It Out!

01:01:19.255 --> 01:01:21.558
You Are Gonna Be
In So... Much...

01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:22.592
Trouble!

01:01:22.625 --> 01:01:24.695
Hey, You're Not
The Boss Of Me!

01:01:24.728 --> 01:01:26.530
I Don't Even
Know You!

01:01:26.563 --> 01:01:28.498
Everybody
Out Of My Way!

01:01:28.531 --> 01:01:29.699
Uhh!

01:01:37.674 --> 01:01:39.876
Ha Ha Ha Ha!
Whoo Hoo Hoo Hoo!

01:01:53.690 --> 01:01:54.858
Unh!

01:01:56.425 --> 01:01:58.228
Oh, Finally.

01:01:58.261 --> 01:02:00.563
Ooh, You Killed It.

01:02:00.596 --> 01:02:03.733
Ooh, I'm Gonna
Tell On You.

01:02:03.766 --> 01:02:05.868
Wha--What?

01:02:05.902 --> 01:02:09.373
We Were Only Making
Just A Little Fun.

01:02:09.406 --> 01:02:11.942
I Think We've
Had Enough Fun.

01:02:12.909 --> 01:02:13.743
Let's Go.

01:02:13.777 --> 01:02:16.346
No! I Don't Want To!

01:02:16.378 --> 01:02:17.346
Move!

01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:19.349
No! No!

01:02:19.382 --> 01:02:20.983
Me Want To Stay Here
With The Big Kids.

01:02:21.016 --> 01:02:22.386
You Ain't
Staying Here, Marigold.

01:02:24.487 --> 01:02:27.523
Stranger Danger!
Stranger Danger!

01:02:27.556 --> 01:02:29.425
We Don't
Even Know You.

01:02:29.458 --> 01:02:32.529
We're Your--
Your Baby-Sitters.

01:02:32.561 --> 01:02:34.330
Uh-Uh. Uh-Uh,
'Cause I'm 7,

01:02:34.364 --> 01:02:35.766
And We Don't Need No Dumb Baby-Sitter.

01:02:35.799 --> 01:02:36.867
Dumb, Dumb, Dumb--

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:39.002
Look, If You Two Don't Behave,
We're Gonna Make Sure

01:02:39.034 --> 01:02:40.737
We Give Your Parents
A Really Bad Report.

01:02:40.770 --> 01:02:41.905
Yeah, We Can Do It, Too.

01:02:41.938 --> 01:02:44.875
We'll Make Absolutely Sure That They Punish You.
Come On.

01:02:44.907 --> 01:02:47.911
No! No! Aah!

01:02:47.944 --> 01:02:50.614
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:02:50.646 --> 01:02:51.614
Get Goin'! Go!

01:02:50.646 --> 01:02:51.614
Ow! Ow!

01:02:51.648 --> 01:02:52.616
We'll Tell Them
To Take Away

01:02:52.648 --> 01:02:54.016
Your Tv Privileges
For A Month.

01:02:54.049 --> 01:02:56.352
I Don't Care.
I Don't Even Watch Tv.

01:02:56.386 --> 01:02:57.887
Mmm. 'Cause Tv
Is For Dummies.

01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:59.522
Ooh, You're Mean.

01:02:59.556 --> 01:03:00.657
We'll Tell
Your Parents

01:03:00.690 --> 01:03:01.758
Not To Allow
You To Read.

01:03:02.791 --> 01:03:04.261
What?
You Can't Do That,

01:03:04.293 --> 01:03:05.494
'Cause I Love To Read.

01:03:05.527 --> 01:03:06.896
I Love To Read
More Than You Do.

01:03:06.929 --> 01:03:07.897
Do Not.

01:03:06.929 --> 01:03:07.897
I Do Too,
And Don't Push Me!

01:03:07.931 --> 01:03:08.965
Do Not.

01:03:07.931 --> 01:03:08.965
He Touched Me.

01:03:08.998 --> 01:03:09.831
Knock It Off!

01:03:09.866 --> 01:03:11.568
Look, If You Two
Don't Want A Bad Report,

01:03:11.601 --> 01:03:12.569
You're Gonna
Go Upstairs With Eddie,

01:03:12.601 --> 01:03:13.636
And I'll Be Right There.

01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:15.372
What Am I Supposed
To Do With Them?

01:03:15.404 --> 01:03:18.474
Amuse Them, Eddie.
I Gotta Go Shut Down The Party.

01:03:18.507 --> 01:03:20.009
People, People,

01:03:20.043 --> 01:03:22.712
Now, Steps Have Already
Been Set In Motion

01:03:22.744 --> 01:03:25.047
To Get The Ballards Evicted
From This Neighborhood,

01:03:25.081 --> 01:03:27.784
And Unless You Want These
Officers To Notify Your Parents

01:03:27.817 --> 01:03:29.886
About Where You've Been
And What You've Been Up To,

01:03:29.918 --> 01:03:31.887
You Will Leave Here
Immediately.

01:03:33.056 --> 01:03:35.659
Marie, I Must Say

01:03:35.692 --> 01:03:37.761
I Am Very
Disappointed In You.

01:03:37.793 --> 01:03:38.728
Now, Hold On, Corkster.

01:03:38.761 --> 01:03:41.030
I Don't Think It's Fair
For Us To Blame Marie.

01:03:41.063 --> 01:03:41.964
I Mean, When You
Grow Up With Parents

01:03:41.998 --> 01:03:44.634
Who Are Too Preoccupied
To Ever Set Limits,

01:03:44.666 --> 01:03:47.404
How Can You Not Expect The
Children To Spin Out Of Control?

01:03:47.436 --> 01:03:51.674
That's Why You'd Never Catch
Our Lizzie At A Party Like This.

01:03:51.708 --> 01:03:52.909
Whatever.

01:03:52.942 --> 01:03:54.911
Mom...

01:03:56.078 --> 01:03:57.079
I'm Right Here.

01:03:57.114 --> 01:04:00.784
Now, Wait.
Before You Get All Mean And Judgmental,

01:04:00.817 --> 01:04:02.853
Can I Just
Say One Thing?

01:04:02.886 --> 01:04:04.521
The Ballards May
Be A Little Strange,

01:04:04.554 --> 01:04:06.889
But They're Also
Incredibly Wonderful.

01:04:06.922 --> 01:04:09.358
Stuff Happens Around Here For No Apparent Reason,

01:04:09.391 --> 01:04:11.027
And It's So Cool.

01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:13.697
This Whole Party
Was Mrs. Ballard's Idea.

01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:14.965
You Guys
Won't Even Let Me

01:04:14.998 --> 01:04:17.900
Have Friends Over
For Milk And Cookies.

01:04:17.933 --> 01:04:21.804
This Only Serves To Confirm My Worst Suspicions.

01:04:21.837 --> 01:04:25.341
The Ballards Are
A Dangerous Influence

01:04:25.375 --> 01:04:27.476
Who Should Be Removed
From Our Neighborhood.

01:04:27.509 --> 01:04:30.913
Officers, I Want You To Arrest These People At Once.

01:04:30.947 --> 01:04:33.049
Mom, Just In Case
You Haven't Noticed,

01:04:33.081 --> 01:04:35.351
Spontaneity
Isn't A Crime.

01:04:35.384 --> 01:04:36.953
Besides, If You Do
Get Them Evicted,

01:04:36.985 --> 01:04:39.822
Don't Ever Expect To Speak To Me Again.

01:04:39.855 --> 01:04:41.824
Whoo!

01:04:41.857 --> 01:04:43.058
All Right.
All Right.

01:04:43.092 --> 01:04:45.762
No Need To Ignite
World War Iii Here.

01:04:47.764 --> 01:04:49.900
Now, You Call
This Party To A Halt,

01:04:49.933 --> 01:04:51.701
And We Will Consider--

01:04:51.733 --> 01:04:55.505
Consider Giving Your Family One More Chance.

01:04:55.538 --> 01:04:58.974
Ahh. Gladly.

01:04:59.007 --> 01:05:03.913
Well, You Heard The Man.
Party's Over.

01:05:03.947 --> 01:05:05.649
Bummer.

01:05:09.819 --> 01:05:11.855
Get--Get...

01:05:11.887 --> 01:05:13.889
You Guys,
Pay Attention!

01:05:13.922 --> 01:05:15.958
W-Why Should I?

01:05:15.991 --> 01:05:18.527
I Don't Wanna Find
Some Dumb Missing Part.

01:05:18.561 --> 01:05:20.797
I Wanna Ride
On The Spaceship.

01:05:20.829 --> 01:05:22.665
Norton, How Many
Times Do I Have To Tell You?

01:05:22.699 --> 01:05:24.768
You Can't Go For A Ride
In The Spaceship

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:26.869
Until You Find
The Missing Part.

01:05:26.902 --> 01:05:29.071
Find It, And You
Can Go For A Ride.

01:05:29.105 --> 01:05:31.074
For Real?

01:05:32.007 --> 01:05:33.509
Me, Too. I Wanna Go.

01:05:33.543 --> 01:05:35.745
You're So Dumb,
Marigoldlocks.

01:05:35.777 --> 01:05:37.913
Girls Can't Go
In The Spaceship.

01:05:37.947 --> 01:05:38.915
Yes, We Can, Too.

01:05:38.947 --> 01:05:39.715
Can Not.

01:05:38.947 --> 01:05:39.715
Better Than Boys.

01:05:39.748 --> 01:05:41.050
Can Not.

01:05:39.748 --> 01:05:41.050
We Can Go Better
Than Boys.

01:05:41.083 --> 01:05:42.051
Yes, We Can.

01:05:41.083 --> 01:05:42.051
Can Not.
Can Not.

01:05:42.085 --> 01:05:43.653
You're
Scared To Go.

01:05:43.686 --> 01:05:44.921
Right. Mmm.

01:05:43.686 --> 01:05:44.921
Oh.

01:05:44.953 --> 01:05:46.656
C-Cool It!

01:05:48.224 --> 01:05:50.660
Whoever Finds
The Missing Part First

01:05:50.692 --> 01:05:53.095
Gets The First Ride
In The Spaceship.

01:05:53.128 --> 01:05:54.096
Me First!
I'm First!

01:05:53.128 --> 01:05:54.096
I'm First!

01:05:54.130 --> 01:05:55.932
That's Me! I Got It!

01:07:15.712 --> 01:07:18.581
Unh. Eh.

01:07:21.918 --> 01:07:24.253
Pfft. Ah. Pfft.

01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:35.532
Eddie?

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.203
Anything?

01:07:40.235 --> 01:07:41.237
Nothing.

01:07:43.873 --> 01:07:45.809
Where's
Mom And Dad?

01:07:45.842 --> 01:07:48.945
Still Looking.

01:07:48.978 --> 01:07:53.049
Caution.
15 Minutes To Poof Point.

01:07:53.081 --> 01:07:56.018
Caution. 15 Minutes
To Poof Point.

01:07:56.052 --> 01:07:58.822
We're Doomed, Aren't We?

01:07:58.855 --> 01:08:01.558
How Can This
Be Happening, Eddie?

01:08:01.590 --> 01:08:04.226
If They Poof This Time...

01:08:06.027 --> 01:08:07.596
It's Gonna Be For Real.

01:08:10.366 --> 01:08:11.868
You Know What's
Really Amazing

01:08:11.901 --> 01:08:13.236
Going Through
All This?

01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:16.638
Who In The World Would Have Ever Thought

01:08:16.671 --> 01:08:20.343
That Our Parents...

01:08:20.375 --> 01:08:21.710
Are Actually...

01:08:21.743 --> 01:08:22.845
Like Us.

01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:27.616
Quick!

01:08:35.157 --> 01:08:36.692
What The?

01:08:41.863 --> 01:08:45.834
I Want My Bottle!

01:08:45.868 --> 01:08:47.837
Marigold,
How Old Are You?

01:08:50.906 --> 01:08:52.207
This Many.

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:54.109
Oh, No.

01:08:56.178 --> 01:09:00.349
Norty? Are You
In There?

01:09:00.383 --> 01:09:01.718
Oh.

01:09:03.785 --> 01:09:06.654
Norty Make A Mess.

01:09:08.723 --> 01:09:11.761
So, This Is
Where You Came In.

01:09:11.794 --> 01:09:14.731
Now You Can See,
With Minutes Left Until Poof Point,

01:09:14.763 --> 01:09:16.098
We Were Desperate...

01:09:16.131 --> 01:09:17.366
But How Could
We Save Our Parents

01:09:17.399 --> 01:09:18.935
Without The Vector
Modulator?

01:09:18.968 --> 01:09:20.136
Sit.

01:09:23.171 --> 01:09:25.241
Here's
Your Treats.

01:09:25.273 --> 01:09:26.375
I Want Purple!

01:09:26.408 --> 01:09:28.178
Red's Better.

01:09:29.178 --> 01:09:32.215
I Got Purple.

01:09:32.247 --> 01:09:33.215
What's Goin' On?

01:09:33.249 --> 01:09:34.983
All Right.
The Whole Time

01:09:35.017 --> 01:09:36.386
I Was Looking For
The Vector Modulator,

01:09:36.419 --> 01:09:37.386
I Was Thinking...

01:09:37.419 --> 01:09:38.921
Even If We Find It,

01:09:38.955 --> 01:09:40.857
What If That's Not
The Only Problem?

01:09:40.889 --> 01:09:43.125
And Then, I Remembered
What Mom Said About

01:09:43.158 --> 01:09:45.261
How They Originally Calculated Their Formulas,

01:09:45.294 --> 01:09:48.131
And Then-- Promise Not To Tell Any Of My Friends--

01:09:48.163 --> 01:09:52.001
I Actually Started To Think Like A Scientist.

01:09:52.033 --> 01:09:53.303
No Way.

01:09:53.335 --> 01:09:54.736
I Know.

01:09:54.770 --> 01:09:56.873
So, What Did
You Figure Out?

01:09:56.905 --> 01:09:58.740
This Whole Density
And Mass Stuff,

01:09:58.773 --> 01:10:00.810
It Wasn't Based On Mom And Dad's Weight.

01:10:00.843 --> 01:10:03.713
It Was Based On The Weight Of The Goldfish.

01:10:03.745 --> 01:10:07.282
Oh, No!
Is That Bad?

01:10:07.316 --> 01:10:08.952
It's Gotta Be.
I'm Betting

01:10:08.985 --> 01:10:10.920
We're Gonna Have To Redo All The Math,

01:10:10.953 --> 01:10:12.455
Or We'll Never
Get 'Em Back.

01:10:12.487 --> 01:10:14.891
Ok, You Stay Here
And Keep Workin',

01:10:14.923 --> 01:10:16.358
And I'll Go Get
The Bathroom Scale.

01:10:24.267 --> 01:10:26.402
Oh, Doggie!

01:10:27.436 --> 01:10:30.340
Oh, Doggie?

01:10:30.373 --> 01:10:32.875
Oh, Look At You.

01:10:32.909 --> 01:10:35.111
Look At Doggie.

01:10:35.143 --> 01:10:38.748
Oh, Hi, Doggie.

01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:39.948
Hi, Doggie.

01:10:39.981 --> 01:10:41.717
Doggie,
Doggie, Doggie.

01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:43.218
Einstein Waited
His Whole Life

01:10:43.252 --> 01:10:44.320
For Dad's Attention...

01:10:44.352 --> 01:10:46.722
Oh, Nice Doggie.

01:10:46.755 --> 01:10:48.724
And When
He Finally Got It...

01:10:49.858 --> 01:10:51.861
He Gave Dad
A Special Treat.

01:10:51.893 --> 01:10:53.329
Doggie Wanna
Play Ball?

01:10:56.031 --> 01:10:56.965
It's My Ball!

01:10:56.999 --> 01:10:59.002
No, It's My Ball.

01:10:56.999 --> 01:10:59.002
It's Mine!

01:10:59.035 --> 01:11:00.403
No, It's My Ball!

01:10:59.035 --> 01:11:00.403
It's Mine!

01:11:00.436 --> 01:11:01.871
No, It's Not!

01:11:00.436 --> 01:11:01.871
It's Mine!

01:11:01.904 --> 01:11:02.938
Gimme!

01:11:01.904 --> 01:11:02.938
It's Not! It's Not!

01:11:02.972 --> 01:11:04.974
Marie, Look!

01:11:02.972 --> 01:11:04.974
Stop!

01:11:05.007 --> 01:11:06.308
That's Not Nice!

01:11:05.007 --> 01:11:06.308
My Ball!

01:11:06.342 --> 01:11:08.111
The Vector Modulator.

01:11:08.143 --> 01:11:10.178
They're Gonna Break It!

01:11:08.143 --> 01:11:10.178
Quick, Grab It!

01:11:10.212 --> 01:11:12.514
Aah!

01:11:10.212 --> 01:11:12.514
No!

01:11:36.038 --> 01:11:39.275
Yay! Nice Doggie!

01:11:39.307 --> 01:11:41.009
Yay! I Got--

01:11:41.043 --> 01:11:42.011
Oh, My Gosh!

01:11:42.044 --> 01:11:43.212
Oh.

01:11:46.014 --> 01:11:48.317
Good Boy!

01:11:48.351 --> 01:11:54.824
Caution. Poof Point
In 3 Minutes, 36 Seconds.

01:11:55.490 --> 01:11:58.527
Vector Modulator Installed.

01:12:03.499 --> 01:12:06.336
Ok, Guys.
Coloring Time's Over.

01:12:06.369 --> 01:12:07.536
Aw.

01:12:07.570 --> 01:12:08.905
Ok, Come
Over Here With Me.

01:12:08.937 --> 01:12:11.406
I'm Gonna Take You
For A Really Nice Ride.

01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:14.277
Oh! A Horsey Ride?

01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:15.311
Whatever.

01:12:15.343 --> 01:12:16.445
Oh!

01:12:15.343 --> 01:12:16.445
Oh!

01:12:16.478 --> 01:12:17.914
Ok, Come On, Guys.
Let's Go.

01:12:17.946 --> 01:12:19.181
Horsey Ride.

01:12:19.214 --> 01:12:20.349
Aah!

01:12:20.383 --> 01:12:22.352
Horsey! Come On, Horsey!

01:12:22.384 --> 01:12:23.953
Come On, Horsey, Come On!

01:12:23.986 --> 01:12:26.422
Maybe We Should Just Walk.

01:12:26.455 --> 01:12:29.459
Uh, Hurry, Kids. Come On.
Everybody Up. Let's Go.

01:12:29.491 --> 01:12:32.261
Gotta Get
This Thing Movin'.

01:12:29.491 --> 01:12:32.261
Oh.

01:12:32.294 --> 01:12:33.262
Yeah, Ok, Come On.

01:12:33.294 --> 01:12:35.431
No!

01:12:35.463 --> 01:12:36.965
It's Ok. Come Here.

01:12:36.999 --> 01:12:38.134
Uh-Oh.

01:12:38.166 --> 01:12:41.070
No!

01:12:38.166 --> 01:12:41.070
Come On, Norton.
It's Ok. Come Here.

01:12:41.102 --> 01:12:42.105
Mmm.

01:12:42.138 --> 01:12:44.574
Norton, Get Over...

01:12:44.606 --> 01:12:46.408
Get Over--
Unh. Unh.

01:12:46.441 --> 01:12:51.013
Poof Point In 3 Minutes.

01:12:51.047 --> 01:12:52.882
Poof Point In 3...

01:12:52.914 --> 01:12:54.316
Norton, Do You Have
To Go Potty?

01:12:54.349 --> 01:12:56.018
Mm-Hmm.

01:12:54.349 --> 01:12:56.018
Now?!

01:12:56.052 --> 01:12:58.420
Uh-Huh.

01:12:56.052 --> 01:12:58.420
Can't You Hold It?

01:12:58.454 --> 01:13:01.057
Mm-Mmm.

01:12:58.454 --> 01:13:01.057
Oh, This
Is Just Great.

01:13:01.089 --> 01:13:02.924
Man, We Don't Even Know If He's Toilet-Trained.

01:13:02.958 --> 01:13:05.428
Norton, Do You Know How To Use The Big Boy Potty?

01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:07.129
Mm-Mmm.

01:13:07.163 --> 01:13:08.263
Oh, Since We're Way Close To Poof Point,

01:13:08.297 --> 01:13:09.165
I'm Gonna Go
With The Theory

01:13:09.197 --> 01:13:11.901
That There's A First Time For Everything.

01:13:11.933 --> 01:13:14.603
Get The Machine Fired Up.
We'll Be Right Back.

01:13:14.637 --> 01:13:16.973
Come On, Norton.

01:13:14.637 --> 01:13:16.973
Bye-Bye.

01:13:20.209 --> 01:13:23.279
Begin Initial
Countdown Sequence.

01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:30.887
Final Countdown To Poof Point 2 Minutes, 35...

01:13:30.919 --> 01:13:32.221
How You Doin'
In There, Big Boy?

01:13:32.254 --> 01:13:33.623
You Almost Done?

01:13:33.655 --> 01:13:35.424
Man, What's Takin'
Him So Long?

01:13:35.458 --> 01:13:36.893
How Am I
Supposed To Know?

01:13:36.925 --> 01:13:38.261
Well, Didn't You
Tell Him To Hurry?

01:13:38.294 --> 01:13:40.596
You Can't Rush Someone
Doing Their Business, Eddie.

01:13:40.629 --> 01:13:42.065
You'll Traumatize Him
For Life.

01:13:42.097 --> 01:13:43.899
Well, If We Don't Get Him Out In 2 Minutes,

01:13:43.932 --> 01:13:45.033

01:13:55.244 --> 01:13:56.212
Oh, No.

01:13:56.245 --> 01:13:57.513
Let's Go.

01:13:59.481 --> 01:14:01.550

Ready?

01:14:07.322 --> 01:14:08.290
A Spacey Ride.

01:14:08.324 --> 01:14:09.692

01:14:14.496 --> 01:14:16.199
Whoo!

01:14:14.496 --> 01:14:16.199
Did You Hear That?

01:14:16.231 --> 01:14:17.566

01:14:17.599 --> 01:14:19.701

01:14:23.438 --> 01:14:24.574
Whoo!

01:14:23.438 --> 01:14:24.574
What's The Matter?

01:14:24.606 --> 01:14:26.141
Is That It?

01:14:26.174 --> 01:14:28.444
Press Enter.

01:14:26.174 --> 01:14:28.444
Enter.

01:14:28.477 --> 01:14:31.280
Settings For Time Retrieval.

01:14:31.312 --> 01:14:34.983

01:14:35.017 --> 01:14:36.552
Prepare For Departure.

01:14:36.584 --> 01:14:37.552

01:14:37.585 --> 01:14:39.554

01:14:39.588 --> 01:14:45.027
Specimens <I>Homo Sapien,
One Male And One Female.

01:14:47.062 --> 01:14:49.065
De-Aging In Progress
Continues

01:14:49.097 --> 01:14:51.299
To One Year.

01:14:51.333 --> 01:14:54.704
Subjects
The Age Of 6 Months.

01:14:56.571 --> 01:14:58.740
Are You Sure
You Did It Right?

01:14:58.773 --> 01:15:00.142
I Think I Did.

01:15:00.175 --> 01:15:02.512
3 Months.

01:15:02.544 --> 01:15:07.215
Subjects De-Aged 2 Months.

01:15:07.249 --> 01:15:11.987
Danger. Proof Point
In 10 Seconds.

01:15:12.021 --> 01:15:15.358
Danger.
Poof Point Imminent.

01:15:15.391 --> 01:15:20.029
Poof Point 5, 4...

01:15:20.062 --> 01:15:23.132
3, 2, 1.

01:15:33.675 --> 01:15:37.179
Ooh.

01:15:37.213 --> 01:15:39.048
Marigold?

01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:40.348
Norton?

01:15:40.382 --> 01:15:43.619
What...
W-What...

01:15:45.286 --> 01:15:47.222
Oh, My Word.

01:15:47.255 --> 01:15:49.758
Did We In Fact
Take Ourselves

01:15:49.791 --> 01:15:53.062
To The Very
Brink Of...

01:15:53.094 --> 01:15:54.230
Poof Point?

01:15:57.333 --> 01:16:00.036
You--You Remember?

01:16:00.069 --> 01:16:04.139
Well, Just Bits
And Pieces, Son. I...

01:16:04.173 --> 01:16:08.177
It's All
Extremely Fuzzy.

01:16:08.209 --> 01:16:13.114
Did I Say
Something About...

01:16:13.147 --> 01:16:16.585
Making A...

01:16:16.619 --> 01:16:18.187
Pee-Pee?

01:16:19.388 --> 01:16:21.824
Norton.
I Don't Understand.

01:16:21.856 --> 01:16:23.558
What Has Happened To Us?

01:16:23.592 --> 01:16:26.362
I'm Not Sure
Precisely,

01:16:26.395 --> 01:16:30.199
But I'm Extremely
Happy To Be Back.

01:16:30.231 --> 01:16:31.533
Oh. Oh.

01:16:31.566 --> 01:16:32.534
Yes.

01:16:32.567 --> 01:16:33.668
Kids.

01:16:33.701 --> 01:16:36.438
Yes.

01:16:38.406 --> 01:16:42.244
Einstein,
Einstein, Hey!

01:16:42.277 --> 01:16:45.580
All Right. Our Dear, Faithful,
Sweet Dog.

01:16:45.614 --> 01:16:47.616
Did That Just Come
Out Of My Mouth?

01:16:47.650 --> 01:16:50.152
Yes, Dear.

01:16:50.185 --> 01:16:51.786
I'm Just So Glad
To Be Back.

01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:53.589
We Missed
You Guys So Much.

01:16:53.621 --> 01:16:54.824
We Were
So Scared.

01:16:54.856 --> 01:16:55.824
We Love
You Guys.

01:16:55.857 --> 01:16:56.825
You Did
A Wonderful Job.

01:17:01.362 --> 01:17:02.632
We Were
Absolutely Sure

01:17:02.664 --> 01:17:05.333
We Were Going To Lose You Guys.
It Was So Scary.

01:17:05.366 --> 01:17:06.636
But How Perfectly
Thrilling

01:17:06.669 --> 01:17:09.305
For You And Eddie
To Come Upon

01:17:09.338 --> 01:17:12.208
And Correct An Error
In Our Calculations

01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:13.608
That Even
We Failed To Notice.

01:17:13.642 --> 01:17:15.144
Well, So Much
For Your

01:17:15.177 --> 01:17:17.280
"We Didn't Get The Science Gene" Disclaimer.

01:17:19.847 --> 01:17:20.782
So, I Guess
This Means We Won't

01:17:20.816 --> 01:17:23.519
Be Getting Away With Cs
In Biology Next Year.

01:17:23.552 --> 01:17:25.454
Exactly, Young Lady.

01:17:25.486 --> 01:17:27.422
Well,
Just Think About It.

01:17:27.455 --> 01:17:30.325
I Mean,
Doesn't It Seem Like Only Yesterday That We Were 14?

01:17:30.358 --> 01:17:31.459
Yesterday?

01:17:31.493 --> 01:17:33.129
Let's Try This Morning.

01:17:37.465 --> 01:17:39.334
Since All This Happened,
We've Been Doing

01:17:39.368 --> 01:17:41.469
A Lot More Things
Together As A Family--

01:17:41.503 --> 01:17:45.540
Average Things
Like Having Barbecues...

01:17:47.409 --> 01:17:48.744
What You Got?

01:17:48.776 --> 01:17:50.378
Playing Music...

01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:54.249
And Taking Trips.

01:17:57.252 --> 01:18:01.624
We Just Returned From A Little
Time Traveling Back To 1975,

01:18:01.656 --> 01:18:04.560
Where I Got To Play Bass With
Bob Marley And The Wailers.

01:18:04.593 --> 01:18:07.396
Now, That's Smooth
And Cool.

01:18:10.632 --> 01:18:13.636
Peace, Mon.
