Yes.

revealing Senator Miller

05:21.377 --> 05:23.689
was engaged in an extra-marital
affair with an intern,

05:23.713 --> 05:25.691
and had fathered a child with her

05:25.715 --> 05:28.961
and had asked his deputy chief
of staff to claim paternity.

05:28.985 --> 05:30.929
You mean the exact documents

05:30.953 --> 05:32.497
that were obtained in the Iran hack.

05:32.521 --> 05:35.601

know where they came from.

documents in The <i>Chronicle</i>

05:37.560 --> 05:39.438

06:11.127 --> 06:13.739
This seemed material.

06:13.763 --> 06:15.474
(SIGHS) I'd say.

06:15.498 --> 06:16.975
Normally, there'd be a firewall

06:16.999 --> 06:18.477
between you and the investigation.

06:18.501 --> 06:20.212
But this is clearly an exception.

06:20.236 --> 06:22.047
After taking appropriate steps,

06:22.071 --> 06:25.651
we all agreed that it was time
to read you in.

06:25.675 --> 06:27.886
I have a lot of questions.

06:27.910 --> 06:30.255
Start with the obvious.

06:30.279 --> 06:33.091
Did Daisy commit a crime?

06:33.115 --> 06:35.861
Well, if she's telling the truth, no.

06:35.885 --> 06:37.696
But if she leaked the file,

06:37.720 --> 06:40.065
she may be liable
under campaign finance laws.

06:40.089 --> 06:41.366
Even then, they'd have to prove

06:41.390 --> 06:43.769
that she knew the
information was hacked.

06:43.793 --> 06:46.204
So, as far as we know,

06:46.228 --> 06:47.673
the only thing she did wrong

06:47.697 --> 06:50.042
was fail to report the
encounter at the time.

06:50.066 --> 06:52.528
Technically, an omission on her SF86.

06:52.529 --> 06:54.880
Which isn't even illegal.
It's a finger wag

06:54.904 --> 06:57.582
- from the OPM.
- The issue here isn't legal jeopardy,

06:57.606 --> 06:59.284
it's public perception.

06:59.308 --> 07:01.319
Tell her.

07:01.343 --> 07:02.954
Well, per Justice rules,

07:02.978 --> 07:05.424
the FBI has until tomorrow

07:05.448 --> 07:07.799
to disclose this finding
to the Senate.

07:08.951 --> 07:12.064
And you think that
Hanson will leak it.

07:12.088 --> 07:13.432

his Conspiratron 5000,

it'll look like you were
twerking with the Ayatollah.

07:19.762 --> 07:21.606
I have to admit, the timing looks bad.

07:21.630 --> 07:23.108
I mean, isn't there anybody

07:23.132 --> 07:25.544
who can corroborate Daisy's story?

07:25.568 --> 07:26.978
Well, there are only two other people

07:27.002 --> 07:28.180
who know what really happened.

07:28.204 --> 07:30.048
This French lady Ms. Bernard

07:30.072 --> 07:32.451
and Valerie Guillen,
the <i>Chronicle</i> reporter

07:32.475 --> 07:33.819
who originally broke the Miller story.

07:33.843 --> 07:37.622
Well, I imagine Guillen
won't reveal her source.

07:37.646 --> 07:39.991
The Grand Jury has issued
a subpoena, but...

07:40.015 --> 07:41.359
She's hugging the First Amendment

07:41.383 --> 07:42.728

07:42.752 --> 07:45.030
Well, that leaves Ms. Bernard.

07:45.054 --> 07:47.699
Obviously, she's an Iranian agent.

07:47.723 --> 07:50.102
DNI Ware is on it now.

07:50.126 --> 07:52.270
So far, all we know
is that she transferred

07:52.294 --> 07:53.872
from the embassy here in D.C.

07:53.896 --> 07:56.408
back to Paris last month.

- lean on the French for cooperation.
- Yes, ma'am.

08:06.675 --> 08:10.428

we find Ms. Bernard.

Sorry. Charley horse.

09:08.838 --> 09:09.881
Uh, the president's here.

09:09.905 --> 09:11.249

09:11.273 --> 09:12.517
Well, also older.

09:36.332 --> 09:37.509
Lookin' good. I love the hair.

09:37.533 --> 09:39.945
Yeah, shades of the summer of '67.

09:39.969 --> 09:41.746
- It's great to see you both. Russell.
- Aw.

09:41.770 --> 09:43.949
How'd they lure you out of retirement?

09:43.973 --> 09:45.150
I asked.

09:45.174 --> 09:47.485
And Carol agreed not to kill me.

09:47.509 --> 09:50.422
Hey, I reserved nine holes
for us at Fort Belvoir.

09:50.446 --> 09:51.423
Can't wait.

09:51.447 --> 09:52.630
Almost forgot.

09:57.286 --> 09:58.496
You brought Gertrude.

09:58.520 --> 10:01.399

still plays sweet as ever.

10:01.423 --> 10:02.434
(LAUGHS)

10:02.458 --> 10:03.802
I'm, uh, polishing up a song

10:03.826 --> 10:05.337
I'm writing for my album.

10:05.361 --> 10:07.405
Did I tell you about my album?

10:07.429 --> 10:10.976
So it's basically a conceptual
folk project for kids.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.379
A lot of work, but Lydia's
been very patient.

10:14.403 --> 10:15.580
How is Lydia?

10:15.604 --> 10:16.882
Sorry she couldn't make it.

10:16.906 --> 10:18.116
Yeah, she sends her best,

10:18.140 --> 10:20.185
and, uh, believe me,
she's had enough time

10:20.209 --> 10:22.454
in this place to last a lifetime.

10:22.478 --> 10:24.356
But, who knows, maybe,
uh, being back here

10:24.380 --> 10:26.324
will be the spark I need
to finish that last song

10:26.348 --> 10:28.326
before I do the interview
with Bob Schieffer.

10:28.350 --> 10:30.028
I thought you weren't doing media.

10:30.052 --> 10:31.863
Eh, just to promote the album.

10:31.887 --> 10:33.498
And, you know, it turns out
Schieffer's a honky-tonk guy.

10:33.522 --> 10:34.566
No kidding.

10:34.590 --> 10:36.468
Oh, uh, Madam President,
Mr. President.

10:36.492 --> 10:39.204
Uh, DNI Ware and Director Banks
need to see you.

10:39.228 --> 10:41.907
- Uh...
- Well, I'm guessing that scratches

10:41.931 --> 10:44.242

- I'm out of practice anyway.

10:45.234 --> 10:46.464
- Can't wait, yeah.
- Great.

10:47.236 --> 10:48.647
Did we get Bernard?

10:48.671 --> 10:50.048
No, ma'am.

10:50.072 --> 10:52.751
French DGSI traced her to
a farmhouse outside of Tours.

10:52.775 --> 10:55.053
But when the local gendarmerie

10:55.077 --> 10:56.388
raided the place, they came up empty.

10:56.412 --> 10:58.290
Then why are we here?

10:58.314 --> 11:00.091
Because I think we found her.

11:00.115 --> 11:02.694
A phone recovered at the farmhouse

11:02.718 --> 11:04.729
gave us a working theory,

11:04.753 --> 11:07.198
which NSA facial recognition

11:07.222 --> 11:09.401
just confirmed.

11:09.425 --> 11:11.336
She's in Tehran.

11:11.360 --> 11:12.971
Yeah, we're still working out
how she got there.

11:12.995 --> 11:14.572
But, for the moment, it's safe to say

11:14.596 --> 11:17.108
Claudine Bernard is out of reach.

11:17.132 --> 11:19.311
Well, we could have Secretary Thompson

11:19.335 --> 11:22.113
put out a feeler,
request an interview.

11:22.137 --> 11:23.682
They'll refuse.

11:23.706 --> 11:26.017
We'll have shown our hand for nothing.

- Madam President.

11:43.158 --> 11:45.337
Claudine Bernard was our best shot

11:45.361 --> 11:48.239
at exonerating Daisy.

(DOOR CLOSES)

12:05.447 --> 12:07.993
Ma'am.

12:08.017 --> 12:09.828
- Ma'am, if I may...
- I've been

12:09.852 --> 12:12.163
briefed on your situation.

12:12.187 --> 12:13.465
I didn't leak it.

12:13.489 --> 12:15.700
Oh, boy, I want to believe you, Daisy.

12:15.724 --> 12:18.169
But when that French woman
gave you the flash drive,

12:18.193 --> 12:20.572
when the story broke,
you stayed silent.

12:20.596 --> 12:22.107
I need to know why.

12:22.131 --> 12:23.375
Because he's a monster.

12:23.399 --> 12:24.442
Who?

12:24.466 --> 12:26.644
Senator Miller.

12:26.668 --> 12:29.581
The story broke the day
after I got the file.

12:29.605 --> 12:32.450
If I'd gone to the FBI,
how would that look?

12:32.474 --> 12:33.852
The way it does now.

12:33.876 --> 12:35.787
Bad.

12:35.811 --> 12:37.822
You should have disclosed it.

12:37.846 --> 12:40.358
And had it been any other
candidate, I would have.

12:40.382 --> 12:44.101
But Miller's a racist,
a bully and a liar.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.331
I did nothing wrong.

12:46.355 --> 12:49.200
But I knew that he would lie
and distort and say that

12:49.224 --> 12:50.668
it was clear evidence
that you were colluding

12:50.692 --> 12:52.203
with a foreign agent.

12:52.227 --> 12:54.973
And because of his stature
as a Republican nominee,

12:54.997 --> 12:57.075
millions of people
would have believed it.

12:57.099 --> 13:00.445
And had those lies sunk your
campaign and he got elected,

13:00.469 --> 13:02.447
I wouldn't have been able
to look my daughter in the eye.

13:02.471 --> 13:04.516
I don't need you to protect me.

13:04.540 --> 13:05.517
I'm sorry, ma'am,

13:05.541 --> 13:07.852
but it's my job to protect you.

13:07.876 --> 13:09.587
And against a guy like Miller,

13:09.611 --> 13:11.623
you can't play by the rules.

13:11.647 --> 13:13.992
I know it felt like that,

13:14.016 --> 13:16.861
but it wasn't your choice to make.

13:16.885 --> 13:18.897
I didn't leak that file.

13:18.921 --> 13:20.465
And I never imagined

13:20.489 --> 13:23.768
that Claudine
would be working for Iran.

silent would have consequences.

Valerie Guillen is under subpoena.

14:32.353 --> 14:34.798
Due in court tomorrow
at noon, which means

14:34.822 --> 14:37.267
she can reveal her true
source before the FBI

14:37.291 --> 14:40.303

14:44.665 --> 14:48.178
Except that the grand jury
proceedings are secret.

14:48.202 --> 14:50.547
So, in theory,
Guillen can reveal her source

14:50.571 --> 14:52.749
without any negative consequences.

drop Daisy and move on.

You're looking to bargain,

myself, I can tell you

27:46.394 --> 27:48.639
it's pretty much

staying at the White House

27:55.636 --> 27:57.347
- during this trip.
- Yeah.

27:57.371 --> 27:59.383
I, uh, I didn't have enough points

27:59.407 --> 28:00.984
to stay at the Hilton, so... (LAUGHS)

28:01.008 --> 28:02.619
Well, it must be a nice change

28:02.643 --> 28:05.022
and a chance to catch up
with your protégé.

28:05.046 --> 28:06.423
You mean my successor.

28:06.447 --> 28:09.159
Well, President McCord is in
some hot water right now.

28:09.183 --> 28:10.627
I'm-I'm just wondering

28:10.651 --> 28:12.296
if you timed this trip

28:12.320 --> 28:13.964
to offer advice.

28:13.988 --> 28:15.466
Come on, advice? (CHUCKLES)

28:15.490 --> 28:18.736
The last thing Elizabeth McCord
needs is my advice.

28:18.760 --> 28:22.172
Her judgment is impeccable
and her honor, unimpeachable.

28:22.196 --> 28:25.275
And yes, I said unimpeachable,
Senator Hanson.

28:25.299 --> 28:26.944
- (CHUCKLES)
- Because

28:26.968 --> 28:28.378
I trust her more than I trust myself,

28:28.402 --> 28:31.215
and if anyone can get through
this farce of an investigation,

28:31.239 --> 28:32.983
it is she.

28:33.007 --> 28:36.553
And she doesn't need any input
from me or from any of you.

28:36.577 --> 28:39.056
Because if anyone can handle
this sexist crap, it's she.

28:39.080 --> 28:41.325
- I hear you, Mr. President.
- I'm sorry.

28:41.349 --> 28:44.294

on good people kind of...

28:44.318 --> 28:45.729

It's a question of judgment.

31:03.557 --> 31:05.802
If you were in her shoes,
what would you have done?

31:05.826 --> 31:07.804
- No idea.
- Gone to the FBI.

While I appreciate that...

31:18.272 --> 31:20.423
it's not perfectly analogous.

31:22.109 --> 31:24.454
Daisy thought she was protecting me,

31:24.478 --> 31:27.824
and the country from Miller.

doing something that was wrong.

Now, do you want a boring speech

38:22.849 --> 38:24.860
or do you want to be citizens?

38:24.884 --> 38:26.362
CANDIDATES: Citizens!

38:26.386 --> 38:27.763
Outstanding.

38:27.787 --> 38:30.800
Please stand, raise your right hand

38:30.824 --> 38:32.307
and repeat after me.

38:34.227 --> 38:36.372
I hereby declare on oath...

38:36.396 --> 38:38.674
CANDIDATES:
I hereby declare on oath...

38:38.698 --> 38:40.876
That I absolutely and entirely...

38:40.900 --> 38:42.945
That I absolutely and entirely...

38:42.969 --> 38:45.314
Renounce and abjure...

38:45.338 --> 38:46.782
Renounce and abjure...

38:46.806 --> 38:48.284
All allegiance and fidelity...

38:48.308 --> 38:50.987
All allegiance and fidelity...

38:51.011 --> 38:53.789
To any foreign prince,
potentate, state

38:53.813 --> 38:56.125
- or sovereignty...
- To any foreign prince,

38:56.149 --> 38:59.034
potentate, state or sovereignty...

38:59.919 --> 39:02.171
(DOOR OPENS)

39:03.056 --> 39:05.468
Thank you for coming.

39:05.492 --> 39:07.470
I'd like an apology.

39:07.494 --> 39:09.839
- You first.
- Excuse me?

39:09.863 --> 39:13.376
You facilitated an attack on our
election with anonymous sources

39:13.400 --> 39:15.578
you couldn't possibly have confirmed.

39:15.602 --> 39:17.046
You put me in jail.

39:17.070 --> 39:19.849
And you put your government
in the impossible position

39:19.873 --> 39:22.485
of choosing between
justice and freedom.

39:22.509 --> 39:24.320
Apology?

39:24.344 --> 39:26.495
I gave you a pardon.

39:32.118 --> 39:34.697
Daisy has a daughter. She's four.

39:34.721 --> 39:37.033
And now that her mom is leaving,

39:37.057 --> 39:38.668
I can't get her out of my head.

39:38.692 --> 39:40.569
One question.

39:40.593 --> 39:43.679
It's not for the courts,
Senate, but for me.

39:44.731 --> 39:46.442
And I swear to you

39:46.466 --> 39:48.611
that your answer
will never leave this room.

39:48.635 --> 39:51.180
- Your source...
- I can't tell you.

39:51.204 --> 39:53.449
Just need to know it wasn't Daisy.

39:53.473 --> 39:55.624
Please?

39:57.711 --> 39:59.862
It wasn't Daisy.

40:03.083 --> 40:05.234
Thank you.

40:08.822 --> 40:10.399
Hey.

40:10.423 --> 40:12.401
Got word from the Hill.

40:12.425 --> 40:15.037
Hanson seems to be backing off.

40:15.061 --> 40:18.140
Extremist sites are still
pushing the collusion angle,

40:18.164 --> 40:21.310
but so far it hasn't crossed
over into mainstream press.

40:21.334 --> 40:23.412
Daisy's resignation seems
to have done the trick.

40:23.436 --> 40:24.947
(SIGHS) For now.

40:24.971 --> 40:27.850
But you feed the wolf, he comes back.

40:27.874 --> 40:30.025
- Gimme.
- Okay.

40:33.146 --> 40:34.890
RUSSELL: That's for Daisy.

40:34.914 --> 40:37.065
I'm gonna miss her, you know.

40:37.917 --> 40:39.628
Yeah.

40:39.652 --> 40:41.803
Me too.

41:00.273 --> 41:02.251
BLAKE: <i>Stevie's asking for an ETA.</i>

41:02.275 --> 41:03.719
Google says 12 minutes.

41:03.743 --> 41:04.954
DALTON: Late to your own party.

41:04.978 --> 41:05.988
That's something.

41:06.012 --> 41:08.224
It's only a party if we win.

41:08.248 --> 41:09.492
HENRY: Well, we have an excuse.

41:09.516 --> 41:11.660
The last-minute heroics
with get out the vote.

41:11.684 --> 41:13.529
DALTON: And whose idea was that?

41:13.553 --> 41:14.797
- Mine.
- Mm.

41:14.821 --> 41:17.639
But I recall... I had an accomplice.

41:21.327 --> 41:23.205
Blake, do we have Miller's number?

41:23.229 --> 41:25.274
- Yes, ma'am.
- HENRY: We're fine.

41:25.298 --> 41:27.376
There's no way they'll call the
election before we get there.

41:27.400 --> 41:30.152
(PHONE CHIMES)
- Except we just won Texas.

41:31.004 --> 41:32.148
And if these results

41:32.172 --> 41:33.655
from Virginia are correct...

41:34.541 --> 41:35.684
Daisy.

41:35.708 --> 41:37.453
DAISY: Ah.

41:37.477 --> 41:39.555
Lord in heaven. Ma'am, I can't believe

41:39.579 --> 41:42.458
I get to be the first one
to tell you this, but...

41:42.482 --> 41:45.394
congratulations,
Madam President-Elect.

41:45.418 --> 41:47.196
BLAKE: Yeah!

41:47.220 --> 41:48.664
- (LAUGHS)
- Well, hey, hey.

41:48.688 --> 41:50.366
Come on. (LAUGHS)

41:50.390 --> 41:52.001
- Oh. Oh.
