00:00.130 --> 00:02.300
- Previously on
"God Friended Me"...

00:02.300 --> 00:03.630
- The dioceses would
like me to be

00:03.630 --> 00:05.500
the next bishop of New York.

00:05.500 --> 00:08.100
- Arthur,
how could you not tell me this?

00:08.600 --> 00:10.010
I can't marry you.

00:10.010 --> 00:13.140
- I love you, Cara, and I know
you can't say that yet,

00:13.140 --> 00:14.910
and it's okay.

00:14.910 --> 00:16.850
- The God Account led me to
Paris, where I found a painting

00:16.850 --> 00:18.880
called "The Path."
- How do we get our hands

00:18.880 --> 00:20.880
on the key to unlock it?
- Well, I'd need access

00:20.880 --> 00:22.890
to the AI program that
created the painting,

00:22.890 --> 00:24.890
- And the only person who can
give that to us is--

00:24.890 --> 00:26.690
- Audrey Grenelle...
Did you know there was

00:26.690 --> 00:28.690
a message hidden in the
painting, "The Path"?

00:28.690 --> 00:30.690
- How could you possibly
know about that?

00:30.690 --> 00:32.060
- Because it was meant for me.

00:38.130 --> 00:40.970
- Just so we're clear,
you dragged me all the way

00:40.970 --> 00:43.110
to my own office to show me
my own painting?

00:43.110 --> 00:45.270
- Well, like we said,
we think that the message

00:45.270 --> 00:48.280
is hidden in the code.
- The message that God left you

00:48.280 --> 00:51.850
is inside the code?
- Not God--the God Account.

00:51.850 --> 00:54.350
- Look, if you could just put
your skepticism aside

00:54.350 --> 00:56.190
for, like, one second...

00:56.190 --> 00:59.360
We really need to know
about this painting.

01:01.990 --> 01:05.090
- A year ago I set out to
disrupt the art world,

01:05.090 --> 01:07.100
push the boundaries of what art
could be,

01:07.100 --> 01:09.830
so basically,
piss everyone off.

01:09.830 --> 01:13.970
I hired a team of coders,
and designed an AI program

01:13.970 --> 01:16.140
that would essentially
replace the artist.

01:16.140 --> 01:19.040
So, all the paintings you saw
at the Future of Art exhibit

01:19.040 --> 01:22.410
at the Louvre
were created by it...

01:22.410 --> 01:24.810
Except that one.

01:24.810 --> 01:26.150
- What are you talking about?

01:26.150 --> 01:28.020
- My program was hacked.

01:28.020 --> 01:30.020
The painting
was designed by

01:30.020 --> 01:32.050
whoever is
responsible for that.

01:32.050 --> 01:34.720
- The God Account.
Has to be.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.790
Were you able
to trace the hack?

01:36.790 --> 01:39.960
- No,
but I've tried everything.

01:39.960 --> 01:42.130
Trust me.

01:42.130 --> 01:45.700
- Why do I get the sense you
aren't telling us everything?

01:45.700 --> 01:47.700
- Well, I thought the message

01:47.700 --> 01:49.840
hidden inside the code
was meant for me.

01:49.840 --> 01:52.880
- Why?
- Doesn't really matter.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.010
- The message
requires numeric code.

01:55.010 --> 01:57.810
If you give me access
to your AI program,

01:57.810 --> 02:00.250
I might be able to find it.

02:00.250 --> 02:03.090
- If this crazy story you're
telling me is true,

02:03.090 --> 02:05.390
I am not a part of it.
- No, you are.

02:05.390 --> 02:09.090
Look, the God Account never
does anything without a reason.

02:09.090 --> 02:11.060
- It wanted us
to find each other.

02:11.060 --> 02:12.900
If we can crack this code,
then maybe we'll both

02:12.900 --> 02:16.230
get the answers
we've been searching for.

02:23.370 --> 02:25.170
- So, any word
on your graduate thesis?

02:25.170 --> 02:27.380
- Actually, I'm meeting with
my advisor this afternoon

02:27.380 --> 02:28.480
to get my first
round of notes.

02:28.480 --> 02:29.950
- Hey, hey, you've been working

02:29.950 --> 02:31.950
on it for six months;
knowing you,

02:31.950 --> 02:35.250
it's probably perfect.

02:40.320 --> 02:44.130
You know, this um...
food is...

02:44.130 --> 02:46.160
amazing.

02:46.160 --> 02:48.130
Don't you think so, Dad?

02:48.130 --> 02:51.030
- Absolutely.
Thank you, sweetheart.

02:51.030 --> 02:53.040
- Do you need
any more coffee or--

02:53.040 --> 02:56.210
- I'm fine,
and not just about the coffee.

02:57.740 --> 02:59.440
I know what the two of you
are trying to do.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.810
Not wanting to talk about
Trish,

03:01.810 --> 03:03.810
and while
I appreciate the concern,

03:03.810 --> 03:06.880
There is no need to
dance around the issue.

03:06.880 --> 03:08.880
- We were just
worried about you.

03:08.880 --> 03:09.950
- There's nothing
to worry about.

03:09.950 --> 03:11.490
Trish is upstate at her farm

03:11.490 --> 03:12.990
giving herself
time to think.

03:12.990 --> 03:15.220
And once she comes back,
we'll work things out

03:15.220 --> 03:17.260
and be walking down the aisle
in no time.

03:17.260 --> 03:19.960
- Dad, I don't think
it's gonna be that easy.

03:21.360 --> 03:24.500
Oh, I need to get out of here.

03:24.500 --> 03:26.500
I have a meeting
with the diocese

03:26.500 --> 03:28.970
to go over next week's
swearing in.

03:28.970 --> 03:29.970
- Thank you for the brunch.

03:29.970 --> 03:31.840
- Mm-hmm.
- Mwuh!

03:37.550 --> 03:39.280
- We need to be here for him,
Miles.

03:39.280 --> 03:40.850
- How?

03:40.850 --> 03:42.220
By letting him pretend
everything is gonna be okay?

03:42.220 --> 03:45.520
I am no therapist,
but he is definitely in denial.

03:45.520 --> 03:48.390
- He's just...
being optimistic.

03:48.390 --> 03:49.760
- Hmm.

03:51.530 --> 03:52.530
- I'll talk to him.

03:56.130 --> 04:00.200
- The God Account just liked
Sarah's Second Hand Shop?

04:00.200 --> 04:02.540
- So, what, that means
it wants you to go shopping?

04:02.540 --> 04:04.440
I don't know, but

04:04.440 --> 04:06.110
I'll let you know
when I find out.

04:07.810 --> 04:09.280
- Well, I have to admit,

04:09.280 --> 04:11.080
the God Account
does have good taste.

04:11.080 --> 04:13.050
This is actually one of
my favorite thrift shops.

04:13.050 --> 04:15.050
- Well, we spoke to the
owner, we've taken a lap

04:15.050 --> 04:17.050
around this place;
any idea what

04:17.050 --> 04:19.050
we're supposed to find here?
- Hmm, no idea,

04:19.050 --> 04:21.490
but we'll figure it out, and
maybe I can find a new purse,

04:21.490 --> 04:23.490
so win-win.

04:30.930 --> 04:33.570
What was that for?

04:33.570 --> 04:35.840
- No reason.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.840
I just...

04:39.940 --> 04:42.880
- I'm happy

04:42.880 --> 04:44.350
that I have you in my life.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.880
- Yeah, me too.

04:52.050 --> 04:53.060
Oh.

04:53.060 --> 04:55.060
Speaking of that new purse,

04:55.060 --> 04:57.190
that one's pretty cute.

04:59.190 --> 05:00.330
- Hm, hm, hm!

05:00.330 --> 05:01.600
Hm?

05:01.600 --> 05:03.270
What do you think?
- Well,

05:03.270 --> 05:05.000
I don't think
the God Account brought us here

05:05.000 --> 05:07.540
to find a new purse.

05:07.540 --> 05:08.540
- No?
- Mm-mm.

05:08.540 --> 05:09.940
- Come on.

05:11.310 --> 05:13.340
Hey.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.180
Check that out.

05:18.250 --> 05:20.620
Hmm.

05:20.620 --> 05:22.080
Sameer Patel.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.320
- Think he's a winner?

05:23.320 --> 05:24.920
- There's only one way
to find out.

05:24.920 --> 05:26.960
Check the numbers
on the website.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.090
- I wrote a story about
people that play the lottery.

05:29.090 --> 05:32.290
Did you know the average person
spends $200 a year in tickets,

05:32.290 --> 05:34.560
and they never win?

05:34.560 --> 05:36.400
- This guy did.

05:36.400 --> 05:39.400
That must be why
the God Account sent us here.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.370
He won $1 million.

05:45.340 --> 05:47.610
- Thank you for sitting down
with me, Dr. Maxwell.

05:47.610 --> 05:49.210
- Of course, Ali.
You've been one of my

05:49.210 --> 05:52.080
top students
the past two years, and

05:52.080 --> 05:54.980
if I'm being
perfectly honest,

05:54.980 --> 05:57.490
I was disappointed
in your thesis.

05:57.490 --> 05:59.660
- Wow, um...

05:59.660 --> 06:01.620
Okay.

06:01.620 --> 06:04.260
If you wanna point out what
part wasn't there for you,

06:04.260 --> 06:06.260
of course,
I'll have another look at it.

06:06.260 --> 06:10.070
- That's the thing, Ali,
it wasn't one specific area.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.070
Your subject matter
was personal:

06:12.070 --> 06:15.040
Single parenting
and the family dynamic--

06:15.040 --> 06:17.270
but it felt... uninspired.

06:17.270 --> 06:20.540
I feel like you've been less
engaged the last few months.

06:20.540 --> 06:22.440
Is everything okay with you?

06:22.440 --> 06:25.180
- Never better.
Honestly, this is coming

06:25.180 --> 06:27.320
as a bit of a shock to me.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.690
- Look, Ali,
it's been a long road,

06:29.690 --> 06:32.520
but you're almost there.

06:32.520 --> 06:33.590
Take a step back,

06:33.590 --> 06:35.520
re-read your thesis,

06:35.520 --> 06:36.730
and let's sit down
and talk about

06:36.730 --> 06:39.260
ways to rethink
your approach.

06:39.260 --> 06:40.130
Okay?

06:44.500 --> 06:47.340
- $1 million?

06:47.340 --> 06:49.400
Man, is this guy
gonna be happy to see you.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.410
- Well, yeah, that's if you can
find him in time.

06:51.410 --> 06:54.080
The ticket expires tomorrow.
- Ooh.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.980
A ticking clock.

06:55.980 --> 06:58.010
God Account's upping it's game.
I like it.

06:58.010 --> 07:00.220
I'm on it.
Okay.

07:00.220 --> 07:02.650
I'm gonna run a search for
Sameer Patel in New York--

07:02.650 --> 07:05.050
this could take a minute.

07:11.460 --> 07:13.360
- Uh, what's that look for?

07:13.360 --> 07:16.030
- Oh--uh, it's Jaya.
Um, the two of us

07:16.030 --> 07:17.230
are going on a secret date.

07:17.230 --> 07:18.670
Tonight's the second one
this week.

07:18.670 --> 07:20.270
I'm gonna be honest.

07:20.270 --> 07:22.440
This whole "sneaking around"
thing, it's really

07:22.440 --> 07:24.370
spiced up our relationship.
Like--

07:24.370 --> 07:26.680
you wouldn't even believe--
- Okay, yeah, yeah,

07:26.680 --> 07:29.210
no, no, no, no,
we get the point.

07:29.210 --> 07:32.080
- Yeah, here we go.

07:32.080 --> 07:34.320
Um, looks like there are...

07:34.320 --> 07:36.590
Six Sameer Patels in New York.

07:36.590 --> 07:39.220
This number should correspond
with the store

07:39.220 --> 07:41.220
it was purchased from,

07:41.220 --> 07:43.130
which, according to
the lottery commission is...

07:43.130 --> 07:44.630
a bodega in Queens.

07:44.630 --> 07:47.300
- Okay, great, any of those
Sameer Patels live nearby?

07:50.570 --> 07:54.070
- Actually, one of them works
at a law firm two blocks away.

07:54.070 --> 07:55.570
That has to be our guy.
Right?

07:55.570 --> 07:58.240
- Can you check to see if the
law firm has a Facebook page?

07:58.240 --> 08:00.380
- Okay, let's see.

08:00.380 --> 08:01.580
Patel & Sons,

08:01.580 --> 08:03.480
run by Sameer Patel
and his brother Jay.

08:03.480 --> 08:04.680
Oh.

08:04.680 --> 08:07.080
says here they're closed
on Sundays.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.450
- Well, can you get us
a home address?

08:08.450 --> 08:10.250
- Absolutely.

08:10.250 --> 08:12.650
You're about to change
this guy's life.

08:19.490 --> 08:21.130
- This is it.

08:27.440 --> 08:28.440
- Can I help you?

08:28.440 --> 08:29.670
- Sameer Patel?

08:29.670 --> 08:30.810
- That's right.

08:30.810 --> 08:32.670
- I'm Miles.
This is Cara.

08:32.670 --> 08:35.310
Uh, we found something
that belongs to you

08:35.310 --> 08:37.180
that you are gonna
be happy to see.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.720
You won!
This ticket is worth

08:41.720 --> 08:42.850
$1 million.

08:46.120 --> 08:47.560
- I want nothing
to do with that.

08:50.390 --> 08:51.730
- Uh...

08:51.730 --> 08:54.230
Yeah, that's not
how I saw that going.

09:00.370 --> 09:01.570
- I don't get it.

09:01.570 --> 09:03.310
Why would someone
turn down $1 million?

09:03.310 --> 09:05.870
- No idea,
but whatever Sameer's reason,

09:05.870 --> 09:07.780
it must be why the God Account
put him on our radar.

09:07.780 --> 09:09.310
- Yeah, so the question is

09:09.310 --> 09:11.310
what happened a year ago
that made him decide

09:11.310 --> 09:13.480
not to cash it?
- I noticed something

09:13.480 --> 09:16.220
on the Patel & Sons Facebook
page that could be our answer.

09:16.220 --> 09:18.150
There was a memorial posting
two days after

09:18.150 --> 09:19.350
Sameer purchased
the winning ticket.

09:19.350 --> 09:20.590
Look.

09:20.590 --> 09:22.120
- "Patel & Sons
sends condolences

09:22.120 --> 09:23.730
to the family of Mira Gupta."

09:23.730 --> 09:26.190
- Who's Mira Gupta?

09:26.190 --> 09:29.600
- They were a couple,
and from the looks of things,

09:29.600 --> 09:31.600
very much in love.
- Okay, so,

09:31.600 --> 09:33.440
Sameer wins the lottery,

09:33.440 --> 09:36.610
but before he can
cash the ticket, Mira dies?

09:36.610 --> 09:37.870
So maybe his grief
over losing her

09:37.870 --> 09:39.740
is preventing him
from cashing the ticket.

09:39.740 --> 09:42.210
- Hm.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.650
- Oh.
- Is everything okay?

09:45.650 --> 09:48.380
- Yeah, it's just Ali.
She needs to talk.

09:48.380 --> 09:51.650
Um, look--we have 24 hours
before this ticket expires,

09:51.650 --> 09:53.720
I say we head down to
Patel & Sons

09:53.720 --> 09:55.720
first thing tomorrow
and see Sameer.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.160
- Yeah, sounds good.

09:58.290 --> 10:01.230
- So what exactly
did your advisor say?

10:01.230 --> 10:05.530
- That my thesis was both
uninspired and disappointing.

10:05.530 --> 10:08.700
- I'm sorry, Al, I know
how hard you've worked on it.

10:08.700 --> 10:10.740
Maybe you can rewrite it
and make it great.

10:12.640 --> 10:13.780
- What if I don't want to?

10:13.780 --> 10:15.440
- What are you talking about?

10:16.310 --> 10:18.410
- She also told me
I've been disengaged

10:18.410 --> 10:20.320
the last few months.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.820
She's right.

10:21.820 --> 10:23.520
I just--I didn't know why,

10:23.520 --> 10:25.390
and I haven't
wanted to face it.

10:25.390 --> 10:27.520
- Face what?
- That maybe this paper

10:27.520 --> 10:29.390
is a wake-up call.

10:29.390 --> 10:31.260
A way of telling me...

10:31.260 --> 10:33.760
This is not what I'm supposed
to do with my life.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.230
- That's crazy.

10:35.230 --> 10:36.600
You've always
wanted to help people.

10:36.600 --> 10:38.670
- I know.
That hasn't changed.

10:38.670 --> 10:39.940
But look at you.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.400
You're helping people
all the time

10:41.400 --> 10:42.940
in the most amazing ways.

10:42.940 --> 10:47.410
- You are welcome to join
the God Account team anytime.

10:48.480 --> 10:50.250
- You have a calling.

10:50.250 --> 10:53.350
And I thought I did too,
but now...

10:53.350 --> 10:54.750
I'm not so sure.

10:54.750 --> 10:55.780
- Have you talked
to dad about it?

10:56.920 --> 10:58.850
- How am I supposed to talk
about being at a crossroads

10:58.850 --> 11:02.290
with someone who is clearly in
denial about the same thing?

11:02.290 --> 11:03.390
- Uh...

11:03.390 --> 11:04.590
What about your pastor

11:04.590 --> 11:06.290
at Advent Congregational?

11:06.290 --> 11:08.430
I mean, you clearly
seem comfortable there.

11:08.430 --> 11:10.800
Maybe she can
give you some insight.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.800
- Hold up.
I'm sorry, um--

11:12.800 --> 11:14.840
Did the atheist just tell me
to go to church?

11:14.840 --> 11:17.310
- No, your brother
just told you to talk

11:17.310 --> 11:20.640
to whoever you need to if
they'll help you find your way.

11:23.450 --> 11:24.480
- Thank you.

11:30.850 --> 11:32.850
- Parker,
what are you doing here?

11:32.850 --> 11:34.960
- Chasing a deadline.
What about you?

11:34.960 --> 11:36.990
- Adam wants to team up
on this story

11:36.990 --> 11:39.330
about some potential
Wall Street scandal

11:39.330 --> 11:41.660
- Nice, but enough about work.
Now that you moved out

11:41.660 --> 11:44.700
of my place, I haven't gotten
any updates on you and Miles.

11:44.700 --> 11:45.900
So, how you guys doing?

11:45.900 --> 11:47.900
- Honestly?

11:47.900 --> 11:51.040
Things have never been better.

11:51.040 --> 11:54.540
I mean, it's like--whatever
anxiety or insecurity I had

11:54.540 --> 11:58.280
about me and Miles--
- You mean saying "I love you"?

11:58.280 --> 12:00.480
- You know, today I could tell
he almost said it,

12:00.480 --> 12:02.320
but he stopped himself.

12:02.320 --> 12:04.950
He's been so sweet about
not putting any pressure on me.

12:04.950 --> 12:07.320
- That's kinda adorable.

12:07.320 --> 12:10.930
- Now when I thought he was
gonna say it,

12:10.930 --> 12:12.930
it didn't scare me.

12:12.930 --> 12:15.360
- So then, maybe it's time.

12:20.670 --> 12:22.770
- Please, thank Sameer,
if it wasn't for him

12:22.770 --> 12:24.310
we'd be out on the street.

12:24.310 --> 12:27.010
- Oh, it was our pleasure.

12:27.010 --> 12:29.380
Hi, I'm Judy.
Can I help you?

12:29.380 --> 12:31.550
- Hi, yes, my name is Miles.
This is Cara.

12:31.550 --> 12:33.550
Uh, we're looking
to see Sameer Patel.

12:33.550 --> 12:35.320
- Well, can I tell him
what this is about?

12:35.320 --> 12:37.520
- Uh, we spoke with him
briefly over the weekend

12:37.520 --> 12:40.360
about a legal matter that we
were hoping he could help with.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.490
- It's kind of urgent.
- Oh, okay, yeah, he's just

12:42.490 --> 12:44.390
finishing up a meeting.
He should be out any minute.

12:44.390 --> 12:46.630
- Oh, here let me help you.

12:46.630 --> 12:49.030
- Oh, thank you.
- Mmm!

12:49.030 --> 12:51.100
Whatever that is,
it smells amazing.

12:51.100 --> 12:53.800
- Punjabi-style
carrot pudding.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.340
Mmm!

12:55.340 --> 12:56.910
Sameer does a lot
of pro bono work, so--

12:56.910 --> 12:59.510
- Has he always done that?

12:59.510 --> 13:00.840
- More so this last year.

13:00.840 --> 13:02.510
Which is wonderful, of course,

13:02.510 --> 13:04.080
but we could use
some more clients

13:04.080 --> 13:06.850
whose payments don't
come wrapped in tinfoil.

13:06.850 --> 13:08.720
- Is it just the three of you?

13:08.720 --> 13:10.990
- It wasn't always, but uh--

13:10.990 --> 13:13.920
we've had to do a little
downsizing this last year.

13:13.920 --> 13:16.660
I worked for their father when
he first opened this place,

13:16.660 --> 13:19.530
so I've known Sameer and Jay
since they were boys.

13:19.530 --> 13:21.760
Practically family.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.700
So we'll--we'll get through it.

13:23.700 --> 13:25.000
- I'm so sorry,
Indira, it won't happen again.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.370
- You say that every time

13:26.370 --> 13:27.900
Sameer forgets
a conference call

13:27.900 --> 13:28.970
or skips a meeting,
but there's no excuse

13:28.970 --> 13:30.470
for missing a court filing.

13:30.470 --> 13:32.840
- I'll call the judge,
he'll be fine.

13:32.840 --> 13:34.040
- The hearing
is this afternoon.

13:34.040 --> 13:36.610
One more mistake,
and I'm done.

13:40.550 --> 13:43.150
- How could you forget
to file the motion?

13:43.150 --> 13:45.790
- I was helping Mrs. Hunjun.
They were about to be evicted.

13:45.790 --> 13:48.120
- You wanna worry
about people being evicted?

13:48.120 --> 13:50.530
Start with us.
We lose Indira,

13:50.530 --> 13:52.890
we'll have to shut our doors.
- Excuse me.

13:52.890 --> 13:56.000
We have new clients waiting.

13:57.870 --> 13:59.870
- They're here for me.

13:59.870 --> 14:02.870
Why don't we
talk in my office?

14:10.980 --> 14:12.810
What are you doing here?

14:12.810 --> 14:14.850
I already told you I want
nothing to do with that ticket.

14:14.850 --> 14:16.920
- Look, we understand that,
but the ticket expires

14:16.920 --> 14:19.550
at the end of the day, and from
what we just heard out there,

14:19.550 --> 14:21.490
it sounds pretty clear.
You need the money.

14:21.490 --> 14:23.460
- Not that way.
I will never cash that ticket.

14:23.460 --> 14:26.630
- Why not?
Look, we know about Mira.

14:26.630 --> 14:28.800
About what happened.
- You don't know anything.

14:28.800 --> 14:31.470
- Okay, then tell us.
Why won't you cash it?

14:31.470 --> 14:33.470
- Because--
That ticket

14:33.470 --> 14:35.540
is the reason Mira is dead.

14:42.680 --> 14:44.510
- Okay, okay, wait, wait--

14:44.510 --> 14:46.920
what do you mean the ticket is
the reason why Mira's dead?

14:46.920 --> 14:50.150
- You wouldn't understand.
This is about Karma.

14:50.150 --> 14:52.050
- Wait, what does Karma
have to do with this?

14:52.050 --> 14:54.990
- Karma is about
spiritual cause and effect.

14:54.990 --> 14:56.760
Good intentions
lead to good Karma,

14:56.760 --> 14:58.160
Bad intentions
lead to bad Karma.

14:58.160 --> 15:00.660
- Right, but how does
buying a lottery ticket

15:00.660 --> 15:01.760
cause bad Karma?

15:01.760 --> 15:04.170
- Because I didn't buy it.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.800
I found it on the street.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.910
When I discovered
it was worth $1 million,

15:11.910 --> 15:13.810
I told Mira
I was going to cash it.

15:13.810 --> 15:16.040
She begged me not to,
told me

15:16.040 --> 15:18.080
that cashing it
was the same as stealing,

15:18.080 --> 15:20.550
that it would
destroy my Karma.

15:23.520 --> 15:25.490
But I didn't believe her.

15:25.490 --> 15:27.760
I signed the ticket,

15:27.760 --> 15:29.790
and I was on my way to cash it

15:29.790 --> 15:32.930
when she was hit by a cab
and died.

15:34.830 --> 15:36.930
Look.

15:36.930 --> 15:39.230
Mira's death was an accident.

15:39.230 --> 15:41.700
You have to see
Karma isn't real.

15:41.700 --> 15:43.200
- Believe me.
It is.

15:43.200 --> 15:45.510
And Mira's death
would be proof enough,

15:45.510 --> 15:47.880
but it didn't stop there.
In the months following that,

15:47.880 --> 15:50.550
my car got broken into,
my apartment got flooded.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.950
- So that's why you started
doing pro bono work:

15:52.950 --> 15:55.150
To restore your Karma?
- Yes.

15:55.150 --> 15:57.990
But the only way to truly do
that is to return the ticket

15:57.990 --> 15:59.890
to its owner,
and let them cash it.

15:59.890 --> 16:01.260
- So how did it end up
in that purse?

16:01.260 --> 16:02.290
- Because I was desperate.

16:02.290 --> 16:03.830
So I put the ticket

16:03.830 --> 16:05.630
in one of Mira's purses
and donated it,

16:05.630 --> 16:09.060
hoping God would unite the
ticket to its rightful owner.

16:09.060 --> 16:11.000
That they'd see
my name written on there,

16:11.000 --> 16:13.900
find me, and let me
sign it over to them.

16:13.900 --> 16:16.040
I thought it had worked
when you two showed up,

16:16.040 --> 16:18.040
but clearly it didn't.
- Okay, well, did you ever

16:18.040 --> 16:20.140
try to find the original owner?

16:20.140 --> 16:21.280
- Of course.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.880
I went to the bodega where the
ticket was purchased,

16:23.880 --> 16:25.780
but they couldn't help me.

16:25.780 --> 16:27.620
What was I supposed to do,
put up flyers?

16:27.620 --> 16:31.320
Who wouldn't want to claim
a $1 million ticket?

16:31.320 --> 16:34.220
The ticket expires
at the close of business today.

16:34.220 --> 16:38.030
And once that happens, there
will be no way to fix my Karma.

16:38.030 --> 16:39.630
- Well, then we need
to find the owner.

16:39.630 --> 16:41.160
- We can help you.

16:42.600 --> 16:43.800
- Help how?

16:45.030 --> 16:49.600
- Well, let's just say we came
into your life for a reason.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.140
If the bodega
has security cameras,

16:56.140 --> 16:57.610
we thought that you
could pull the footage.

16:57.610 --> 16:59.110
- Well, Miles Finer,

16:59.110 --> 17:02.180
nonbeliever and skeptic
extraordinaire,

17:02.180 --> 17:04.790
has agreed to help someone
restore their Karma.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.650
I would not miss it.

17:06.650 --> 17:08.360
- I agreed to find the original
owner of the lottery ticket

17:08.360 --> 17:11.360
because Sameer said
it will help restore his Karma,

17:11.360 --> 17:13.900
but that's not what
this is about.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.930
- Says you.
- Aw, come on, bro,

17:15.930 --> 17:17.670
since when do you
believe in Karma?

17:17.670 --> 17:19.970
- Since always!
Just because I don't go around

17:19.970 --> 17:22.040
talking about my beliefs
on a podcast

17:22.040 --> 17:23.740
doesn't mean I don't believe,
dude.

17:23.740 --> 17:26.310
Hinduism is, like, the oldest
religion on the planet.

17:26.310 --> 17:28.240
Plus, what's so crazy
about the idea that

17:28.240 --> 17:30.680
what you put out there
into the world

17:30.680 --> 17:33.950
affects what comes back at you?
- Sameer's life imploded

17:33.950 --> 17:35.820
because he lost
the person that he loves.

17:35.820 --> 17:38.650
That's not Karma, that's grief.
- Okay, okay, I'm gonna stop

17:38.650 --> 17:40.820
the two of you before this
turns into a holy war.

17:40.820 --> 17:42.220
Now, onto a matter

17:42.220 --> 17:43.960
we can all agree on:
Have you had a chance

17:43.960 --> 17:45.790
to look into Audrey Grenelle's
AI program yet?

17:45.790 --> 17:48.700
- I did, but when I was looking
at the painting I found that

17:48.700 --> 17:50.800
we need this 11-digit number
to unlock the code

17:50.800 --> 17:53.030
and reveal whatever message
is hidden inside it.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.370
- Hey, that's great.

17:54.370 --> 17:56.100
So how long will it take you
to crack it?

17:56.100 --> 17:58.110
- An 11-digit passkey
can have over, like,

17:58.110 --> 18:00.240
ten billion combinations.
Even if I had

18:00.240 --> 18:02.980
a random number generator
working 24/7,

18:02.980 --> 18:04.980
it could take years.

18:08.120 --> 18:09.880
- Do you remember
Sameer coming in

18:09.880 --> 18:10.990
and talking to you about it?

18:10.990 --> 18:12.850
- Oh, yeah.
Nice guy.

18:12.850 --> 18:14.120
He comes in here
all the time.

18:14.120 --> 18:15.990
Look, I wish I could help you,

18:15.990 --> 18:18.390
but we sell hundreds of these a
week, and this was a year ago.

18:18.390 --> 18:21.060
- Well, what about
your security cameras?

18:21.060 --> 18:23.060
- The hard drive
only holds a few days

18:23.060 --> 18:25.270
before it's recorded over.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.270
- Well, I know a lot of people
who play the lottery

18:27.270 --> 18:30.040
have superstitions, like always
playing the same numbers.

18:30.040 --> 18:32.240
- Hmph, sorry.
Numbers for Lucky Lotto

18:32.240 --> 18:34.240
are generated by the machine.
- Well, the ticket

18:34.240 --> 18:36.680
was purchased around this time.
Do you have any regulars

18:36.680 --> 18:38.910
that come around now?
- The only regulars I have

18:38.910 --> 18:41.120
at this time
are those officers.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.420
They come in at the start of
their shift every day,

18:43.420 --> 18:45.150
but they don't
play the lottery.

18:45.150 --> 18:47.160
- 'Scuse me, are you going to
stand here and just talk

18:47.160 --> 18:50.390
all day?
Uh--I'd like a $20 Lucky Lotto.

18:58.430 --> 19:00.770
Thank you.

19:00.770 --> 19:05.040
- You can pay for a lottery
ticket using a debit card?

19:05.040 --> 19:07.310
- Of course.
- Rakesh...

19:07.310 --> 19:09.240
If a person we're looking for
paid with a debit card,

19:09.240 --> 19:11.710
could you track them down?
- If that's how they paid

19:11.710 --> 19:13.920
for it,
yeah, I can.

19:17.750 --> 19:19.450
- Hey, Pastor Olivia.

19:19.450 --> 19:21.790
- Ali, how are you?

19:21.790 --> 19:25.730
- Ugh, I could be better.

19:25.730 --> 19:27.500
Do you have a minute?

19:27.500 --> 19:29.900
- Have a seat.

19:29.900 --> 19:33.070
What's on your mind?
- So--I've talked to you about

19:33.070 --> 19:35.140
how I'm studying to become
a therapist, right?

19:35.140 --> 19:37.140
- Of course.
If I'm not mistaken

19:37.140 --> 19:41.040
you graduate soon?
- Supposed to,

19:41.040 --> 19:43.850
but I got my thesis
back from my advisor.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.280
She thought it was...

19:45.280 --> 19:48.150
less than inspired.
- I see.

19:48.150 --> 19:50.150
- I feel like
I'm at a crossroads,

19:50.150 --> 19:53.320
and I could really
use some advice.

19:56.520 --> 19:58.760
- I'm sorry, Ali,

19:58.760 --> 19:59.960
I can't help you.

20:01.330 --> 20:04.130
- Wow, um--
as my pastor...

20:04.130 --> 20:06.170
I was hoping for
a little more than that.

20:06.170 --> 20:09.300
What I mean to say is,

20:09.300 --> 20:11.970
you're the only person
that can figure this out.

20:14.780 --> 20:16.010
But I do have a suggestion.

20:16.010 --> 20:17.910
- Okay, better.

20:19.180 --> 20:21.950
- There's a church life forum
here tonight.

20:21.950 --> 20:23.790
It's a service
where congregants

20:23.790 --> 20:26.960
can share the issues that
they're struggling with.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.790
More often than not,

20:28.790 --> 20:31.530
just standing up
and speaking from the heart,

20:31.530 --> 20:33.960
it's enough to give you
a little insight from God.

20:36.400 --> 20:39.200
- So why didn't Cara
come back with us?

20:39.200 --> 20:41.400
- Uh, she had to work
on a story,

20:41.400 --> 20:43.400
and said she had a ton of
research to do.

20:43.400 --> 20:46.410
- She say
the three magic words yet?

20:46.410 --> 20:48.010
- No.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.750
- That's okay.

20:53.050 --> 20:55.450
- Alright, fine, yes, I would
like for her to say it,

20:55.450 --> 20:57.250
but when she's ready.

20:57.250 --> 20:59.450
- When will that be?

20:59.450 --> 21:00.960
- I have no idea.

21:04.460 --> 21:06.590
- Aw, Jaya had to cancel
our secret date tonight.

21:06.590 --> 21:08.600
She's having dinner
with her parents.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.430
- Wait, do they know that
you two are still dating?

21:11.430 --> 21:14.270
- We played it perfectly,
alright?

21:14.270 --> 21:16.570
You don't have to worry
about that, trust me.

21:18.310 --> 21:21.210
- Okay, here we go.
I got a program running

21:21.210 --> 21:23.080
to check the transactions
from the bodega

21:23.080 --> 21:24.280
of that day and time.

21:24.280 --> 21:25.850
Shouldn't take more than
a few minutes.

21:25.850 --> 21:27.020
- Well, assuming

21:27.020 --> 21:28.420
they didn't
pay in cash.

21:28.420 --> 21:30.420
- It's a bit of a long shot,
but hey,

21:30.420 --> 21:33.150
you put something good
out into the world...

21:33.150 --> 21:35.090
should get something back.

21:35.090 --> 21:37.330
- You realize
you do not have valet?

21:37.330 --> 21:39.490
I just kept driving till
I finally just parked where

21:39.490 --> 21:41.500
it looked like there should
be there should be valet.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.470
- So you parked at the curb?

21:45.470 --> 21:48.140
- Huh?
- Audrey, what's going on?

21:48.140 --> 21:50.370
- I kept thinking
about the 11-digit number

21:50.370 --> 21:53.070
you said we'd need
to crack "The Path,"

21:53.070 --> 21:54.810
And I wanted
to show you something.

21:56.510 --> 21:58.610
It's the road that leads up to
my grandparents' summer house

21:58.610 --> 22:00.080
in Marseille,

22:00.080 --> 22:02.420
my absolute favorite place
as a little girl.

22:02.420 --> 22:04.890
It reminded me of "The Path."

22:04.890 --> 22:06.890
- Rakesh, pull it up.

22:11.260 --> 22:13.290
Wait, that's why you thought
the message was for you;

22:13.290 --> 22:15.630
why it felt so personal,
because of this photo.

22:15.630 --> 22:17.170
- Yes.

22:17.170 --> 22:18.270
- So how does this help us
crack the code?

22:18.270 --> 22:19.970
- Turn it over.

22:21.400 --> 22:24.610
If you include the postal code
and region number,

22:24.610 --> 22:27.980
The address is made up
of 11 digits.

22:47.460 --> 22:48.700
- Ugh.

22:48.700 --> 22:51.470
- I thought for a second that
was actually going to work.

22:51.470 --> 22:53.530
If you think this message
is something

22:53.530 --> 22:55.970
that God wants you to see--
- "Account."

22:55.970 --> 22:57.540
The God Account.

22:57.540 --> 22:59.710
- Why not give you
the numbers to unlock it?

22:59.710 --> 23:03.280
I mean, maybe jot them down
on a stone tablet or something.

23:07.420 --> 23:10.250
- Wait.
Sameer's lottery ticket.

23:10.250 --> 23:11.990
- Naw,
lottery ticket's six numbers--

23:11.990 --> 23:17.020
- Numbers, yes, but if you
count the individual digits...

23:17.020 --> 23:19.360
Sameer's ticket has 11.

23:35.580 --> 23:38.180
- Sucks, right?

23:39.310 --> 23:41.480
- Miles?
- Hmm?

23:41.480 --> 23:44.220
- We just got a hit on
our mystery lottery winner.

23:44.220 --> 23:45.450
- You're kidding.
- No.

23:45.450 --> 23:47.520
At the same time
that the ticket was issued

23:47.520 --> 23:49.060
a debit card was swiped

23:49.060 --> 23:51.330
at the bodega
for $5 even.

23:51.330 --> 23:53.330
- Tim Whitson,

23:53.330 --> 23:56.230
2057 West 66th Street.

23:56.230 --> 23:58.070
- What are you
two talking about?

23:59.270 --> 24:02.340
- Do you wanna see how the
God Account works first-hand?

24:04.270 --> 24:05.470
- No.

24:09.580 --> 24:12.480
- Hey, Sameer,
this is my good friend Rakesh.

24:12.480 --> 24:13.710
He's the one who tracked down

24:13.710 --> 24:15.250
the owner of
the lottery ticket.

24:15.250 --> 24:16.380
- I don't know
how to thank you.

24:16.380 --> 24:17.650
- Nah, don't mention it.

24:17.650 --> 24:19.090
- I have to be in court
in an hour.

24:19.090 --> 24:20.620
Indira's expecting me there.

24:20.620 --> 24:22.520
- Alright, well let's go tell
Tim Whitson the good news.

24:27.030 --> 24:29.430
- Can I help you?
- Hi, are you Tim Whitson?

24:29.430 --> 24:31.630
- That's right.
- Uh, I'm Miles Finer.

24:31.630 --> 24:34.500
My friends and I may have found
something that belongs to you,

24:34.500 --> 24:36.570
and sorry to be so cryptic;
we just wanna make sure

24:36.570 --> 24:38.210
that you're the right person.
- Okay.

24:38.210 --> 24:41.240
- Have you ever been to the
Palace Bodega in Queens?

24:41.240 --> 24:43.240
- Actually, I think I have.

24:43.240 --> 24:45.510
I was in Queens
last year for business.

24:45.510 --> 24:46.780
I only remember
because I hardly

24:46.780 --> 24:48.450
have meetings
outside of Manhattan.

24:48.450 --> 24:49.780
- Do you remember
what you bought?

24:49.780 --> 24:51.320
- Sorry, no.

24:51.320 --> 24:53.320
- Do you ever
play the lottery?

24:53.320 --> 24:56.260
- Uh... no.

24:56.260 --> 24:58.430
So, uh, what did you find?

24:58.430 --> 25:00.560
- It was a lottery ticket,
but obviously,

25:00.560 --> 25:03.460
it doesn't belong to you.
- Sorry.

25:03.460 --> 25:05.370
I don't mean to be rude,
but I am busy,

25:05.370 --> 25:07.440
so is that all?
- Yes, thank you.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.700
It's okay.

25:09.700 --> 25:11.270
We still got
a couple more hours.

25:12.470 --> 25:14.640
- Hello, Judy.

25:14.640 --> 25:15.680
Slow down.

25:16.840 --> 25:18.750
It wasn't scheduled
for another hour.

25:18.750 --> 25:20.350
Jay can't do that.

25:20.350 --> 25:21.450
Tell him I'll be right there.

25:21.450 --> 25:25.150
Okay, I'll--I'll come back.

25:25.150 --> 25:26.350
That was Judy.

25:26.350 --> 25:27.820
Our court time got pulled up,

25:27.820 --> 25:29.760
and I missed it.
- Is everything okay?

25:29.760 --> 25:31.530
- No.
We lost.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.690
Our client Indira fired us.

25:32.690 --> 25:34.730
Judy said Jay
is closing the firm.

25:36.430 --> 25:39.430
This is my bad Karma at work.

25:50.510 --> 25:53.710
- Judy, I'm sorry.

25:53.710 --> 25:56.250
- It's okay.
I'll be okay.

25:56.250 --> 25:58.580
- No, I'll fix this,
I promise.

25:58.580 --> 26:01.790
- You need to listen to me,
Sameer.

26:01.790 --> 26:04.720
Now, I know how much
you still miss Mira;

26:04.720 --> 26:07.060
how tough this last year
has been,

26:07.060 --> 26:10.030
but you have to figure out
how to make peace with it.

26:10.030 --> 26:12.670
Because if you don't,
I'm afraid you and your brother

26:12.670 --> 26:15.000
are gonna lose
a lot more than a law firm.

26:29.780 --> 26:31.780
- I just got off the phone
with the building manager

26:31.780 --> 26:35.150
to let him know
we'll be vacating our lease.

26:36.160 --> 26:37.920
This office has been
in our family for 40 years.

26:37.920 --> 26:40.090
- Look, there must be
something that we can do.

26:40.090 --> 26:44.860
- All Sameer had to do
was show up in court today.

26:44.860 --> 26:46.100
He didn't.

26:46.100 --> 26:48.030
You mind telling me
what was more important

26:48.030 --> 26:49.540
than saving our firm?

26:53.310 --> 26:56.780
- A year ago, I found
a lottery ticket in the street.

26:56.780 --> 26:59.350
It was a winner.

26:59.350 --> 27:02.350
$1 million.
- $1 million?

27:02.350 --> 27:04.180
I don't understand.
Did you cash it?

27:04.180 --> 27:07.590
- I was going to,
and then Mira was killed...

27:07.590 --> 27:09.220
and she was killed because

27:09.220 --> 27:11.890
I was going to take money
that didn't belong to me.

27:11.890 --> 27:14.090
She told me not to cash it.

27:14.090 --> 27:17.800
The reason she is dead
is because of me.

27:17.800 --> 27:20.770
- Why didn't you come to me?

27:20.770 --> 27:22.870
I'm your brother; I could have
helped you through this.

27:22.870 --> 27:24.940
- Because you
don't believe in Karma,

27:24.940 --> 27:28.210
and everything that's happened
is because of my Karma.

27:28.210 --> 27:29.680
I had to try and fix it.

27:29.680 --> 27:30.940
- I called Sameer
because we thought

27:30.940 --> 27:33.110
we found the owner
of the ticket.

27:33.110 --> 27:34.680
- But it wasn't them.

27:34.680 --> 27:36.950
- Now, the ticket
expires in three hours.

27:36.950 --> 27:39.820
We're going to keep looking.
We'll find them, I promise.

27:39.820 --> 27:40.890
- And if you don't?

27:40.890 --> 27:42.990
That money goes to no one.

27:44.060 --> 27:46.330
You want me
to cash the ticket?

27:46.330 --> 27:49.700
- I want you to save
Patel & Sons.

27:50.830 --> 27:53.030
Save the legacy
our father built.

27:55.640 --> 27:57.600
- And if I don't
cash the ticket?

27:59.910 --> 28:02.580
- Then we're
no longer brothers.

28:03.310 --> 28:04.780
How could we be?

28:15.050 --> 28:17.690
Give him the ticket.
- Sameer, Sameer.

28:17.690 --> 28:20.260
It's not too late.
- Give it to him, please.

28:20.260 --> 28:23.830
- Fine.
Fine.

28:23.830 --> 28:25.130
But I don't have it on me.

28:26.930 --> 28:29.140
I wasn't gonna
be responsible for losing

28:29.140 --> 28:32.100
a $1 million ticket
by walking around with it.

28:32.100 --> 28:34.040
Someone's already
done that.

28:34.040 --> 28:35.740
It's at my place.

28:35.740 --> 28:38.040
Give me an hour.

28:38.040 --> 28:39.780
- Fine.

28:39.780 --> 28:41.780
It's not like anyone
can cash it without me

28:41.780 --> 28:44.120
signing it over to them anyhow.

28:47.390 --> 28:50.190
- One hour.
You better be here.

28:53.790 --> 28:56.060
-  So Jay wants to
cash the ticket.

28:56.060 --> 28:59.000
- Yes, that's why I told him
I didn't have the ticket.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.870
I need to buy some more time.
- What are you gonna do?

29:01.870 --> 29:05.170
- Honestly, I might just
sit here and let it expire.

29:05.170 --> 29:07.310
I mean,
it's the only way to ensure

29:07.310 --> 29:09.210
that it won't
tear them apart.

29:09.210 --> 29:11.440
- Hi.

29:11.440 --> 29:12.750
Is, uh, Ali here?

29:12.750 --> 29:14.080
- No, why?

29:14.080 --> 29:15.350
- I wanted to know
how her meeting

29:15.350 --> 29:16.920
went with her advisor.

29:16.920 --> 29:19.450
Have you spoken with her?

29:19.450 --> 29:21.790
- Yes, actually.

29:21.790 --> 29:23.820
- Uh, you know what, I have to

29:23.820 --> 29:24.820
talk to Rakesh about something,
but I'll call you later.

29:24.820 --> 29:26.090
- Kay.
- Bye Arthur.

29:26.090 --> 29:29.000
- Bye, good to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.060
- So?
What did she tell you?

29:31.060 --> 29:32.730
Her advisor thought

29:32.730 --> 29:35.270
that her paper was uninspired.

29:38.040 --> 29:39.910
How come she never
came to me with this?

29:39.910 --> 29:43.180
- Because she's worried about
you, Dad.

29:43.180 --> 29:44.280
We both are.

29:47.480 --> 29:48.950
Trish called off the wedding

29:48.950 --> 29:50.950
and left town,
and your response was to

29:50.950 --> 29:53.090
pretend like
everything was okay.

29:53.090 --> 29:55.520
Ali is going through
a tough time,

29:55.520 --> 29:58.890
and she is trying
to face it head-on.

29:58.890 --> 30:01.130
That's why she didn't
talk to you about it.

30:03.160 --> 30:04.200
- Because I'm not.

30:07.900 --> 30:10.870
I've gotta talk to her.
Thanks, Miles.

30:13.840 --> 30:15.510
Got a winner on your hands?
- I do.

30:15.510 --> 30:18.910
It's worth $1 million,
but it expires in a few hours.

30:18.910 --> 30:20.810
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

30:20.810 --> 30:23.380
My Friend Suggestion
was about to cash it

30:23.380 --> 30:24.820
when his girlfriend was killed.

30:24.820 --> 30:26.250
He believes her death

30:26.250 --> 30:28.520
is his fault;
that intending to cash

30:28.520 --> 30:30.520
the ticket brought
him bad Karma,

30:30.520 --> 30:32.860
but his brother Jay
wants him to cash it

30:32.860 --> 30:34.560
to save their law firm.
- What are you gonna do?

30:34.560 --> 30:36.400
- I don't know.
If--if Jay cashes it,

30:36.400 --> 30:39.000
Sameer will never forgive him,
and I can't let that happen.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.130
Kind of a lose-lose situation.
Any thoughts?

30:42.130 --> 30:45.400
- Well, if cashing the ticket
will tear them apart,

30:45.400 --> 30:47.440
you have to convince them
of that,

30:47.440 --> 30:50.440
but it has to be
their decision.

30:56.880 --> 30:58.920
- Hey.
- Hey, your text said

30:58.920 --> 31:01.020
you needed
to talk about something?

31:01.020 --> 31:03.360
- Well, I was hoping you might
be able to do me a favor.

31:03.360 --> 31:05.520
- Yeah, well considering,
um, I can't crack

31:05.520 --> 31:07.360
the God Account painting,
and I can't meet

31:07.360 --> 31:09.600
my girlfriend tonight,
yup, I got nothing but time.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.160
What's up?
- I'm working a story,

31:11.160 --> 31:12.830
and I just need help
tracing an email account.

31:12.830 --> 31:14.500
- Yeah, just forward it to me,
I'll look into it.

31:14.500 --> 31:17.300
- Okay, thanks.
So, Miles told me what happened

31:17.300 --> 31:19.370
with Sameer and Jay.

31:19.370 --> 31:21.440
There's gotta be a way that
we can figure out

31:21.440 --> 31:24.580
who bought that ticket.
- In the next two hours?

31:24.580 --> 31:27.180
I mean, I'm open to ideas.
- Well--

31:27.180 --> 31:29.320
I know the bodega said they
don't keep security footage,

31:29.320 --> 31:31.480
but what about
the traffic cameras outside?

31:31.480 --> 31:33.390
- Already checked.
Nada.

31:36.190 --> 31:38.220
- What is it?

31:38.220 --> 31:40.230
- It's Tom from my office.
He keeps sending me

31:40.230 --> 31:42.530
all these crazy cop videos.
- Wait, let me see.

31:42.530 --> 31:46.170
-  Oh, my--they can't
even get the handcuffs on.

31:46.170 --> 31:48.370
- Wait.

31:48.370 --> 31:50.940
Dash cam footage.
Rakesh, that's it.

31:50.940 --> 31:53.940
That's the answer.

31:56.480 --> 31:58.410
- Sameer!
Jay!

31:58.410 --> 32:00.350
- You're finally here.
We've only got two hours,

32:00.350 --> 32:01.350
give me the ticket.

32:02.350 --> 32:04.420
- You have to understand
what cashing this ticket

32:04.420 --> 32:07.490
means for Sameer--what it will
mean for your relationship.

32:07.490 --> 32:09.420
- It means saving our firm.

32:09.420 --> 32:12.060
- No, it means the end
of your firm,

32:12.060 --> 32:13.490
at least for
the two of you.

32:13.490 --> 32:16.100
Now, you can call it Karma,
you can call it bad luck,

32:16.100 --> 32:17.300
you can call it blood money.

32:17.300 --> 32:19.200
But no matter
what you call it,

32:19.200 --> 32:21.230
you will be choosing
it over Sameer,

32:21.230 --> 32:23.640
and he will never
forgive you for it.

32:30.340 --> 32:32.180
- I'm sorry, Sameer,

32:32.180 --> 32:34.210
but I can't let
$1 million go unclaimed

32:34.210 --> 32:36.350
when we could use it
to save our firm.

32:36.350 --> 32:37.850
Give me the ticket.

32:48.430 --> 32:51.130
- Hey, Rakesh,
now is not a good ti--

32:52.500 --> 32:54.970
Wait, what?

32:58.400 --> 32:59.870
We're on our way.

33:04.010 --> 33:06.980
- Officer Murphy, Officer Car.
- Hey, Sameer.

33:06.980 --> 33:08.980
- Wait,
you two know each other?

33:08.980 --> 33:10.980
- Officer Murphy was just
telling us that Sameer

33:10.980 --> 33:12.990
helped a friend of his
who was about to get fired.

33:12.990 --> 33:15.290
He took the case pro bono.
- It was nothing.

33:15.290 --> 33:17.360
Sorry, what is this about?
- Whatever it is,

33:17.360 --> 33:19.430
we don't have time.
- Actually--

33:19.430 --> 33:22.230
they were here when the
lottery ticket was purchased.

33:22.230 --> 33:24.700
- The dash cam footage from a
year ago was recording everyone

33:24.700 --> 33:27.370
coming in and out of the bodega
at that time, including...

33:27.370 --> 33:30.040
the owner of the ticket.
- But even if we have them

33:30.040 --> 33:31.600
on tape, there's no way
we have enough time

33:31.600 --> 33:33.710
to go and find them.

33:33.710 --> 33:36.080
- I think
we might be able to.

33:44.380 --> 33:47.120
- It's Judy!

33:47.120 --> 33:49.320
- I don't believe it.
- I know she goes

33:49.320 --> 33:51.460
to the bodega--we all do--
but I had no idea

33:51.460 --> 33:53.430
she played the lottery.
- Well, maybe she lost

33:53.430 --> 33:55.630
her ticket on the way to work.
- Yeah, and since she probably

33:55.630 --> 33:58.300
didn't remember the numbers
and assumed she'd ever win,

33:58.300 --> 34:00.300
she never thought
about it again,

34:00.300 --> 34:02.640
- We gotta go to Judy's.
- No, there's no time.

34:02.640 --> 34:04.340
Let's cash the ticket
and give her the money.

34:04.340 --> 34:06.410
- No, I have to sign the ticket
over to her

34:06.410 --> 34:08.610
and let her cash it herself:
It is the only way that

34:08.610 --> 34:11.480
I can restore my Karma.

34:13.450 --> 34:15.750
Please.

34:19.790 --> 34:22.220
- Alright.
Let's go.

34:22.220 --> 34:24.320
- I can't believe it.

34:24.320 --> 34:27.090
After all this time,
it was Judy.

34:27.090 --> 34:29.300
I can't imagine anyone
who deserves it more.

34:29.300 --> 34:31.760
- You both do.

34:35.370 --> 34:37.500
- Judy?

34:41.510 --> 34:42.980
Judy, you here?

34:49.050 --> 34:50.580
Judy!

34:50.580 --> 34:52.120
Judy, Judy!

34:52.120 --> 34:53.820
She's not responding.

34:53.820 --> 34:55.520
- Call 911.

35:03.400 --> 35:06.330
- Sameer blames himself.
- It's not his fault.

35:06.330 --> 35:08.370
- No, but he doesn't
see it that way.

35:08.370 --> 35:11.270
He still thinks
it's about his Karma.

35:13.340 --> 35:14.810
- Is she okay?

35:14.810 --> 35:16.810
- Judy suffered
a brain aneurysm.

35:16.810 --> 35:19.780
Her surgery was successful,
and we've stabilized her.

35:21.410 --> 35:23.680
- Lucky you were there.

35:23.680 --> 35:25.680
If you hadn't have found her
when you did,

35:25.680 --> 35:27.450
she wouldn't have made it.

35:27.450 --> 35:30.460
You'll be able to see her
in a few hours.

35:34.090 --> 35:36.800
- Ticket's expired.

35:36.800 --> 35:40.430
I'm so sorry, Sameer.

35:40.430 --> 35:42.830
- All that matters is that
Judy's gonna be fine,

35:42.830 --> 35:46.370
and if that means my Karma
will never be restored...

35:48.040 --> 35:50.210
That's a price that
I'm willing to pay.

35:50.210 --> 35:52.210
- Sameer, don't you see?

35:52.210 --> 35:54.450
This started
with the loss of a life:

35:54.450 --> 35:56.450
The accident that killed Mira,

35:56.450 --> 35:58.950
the accident
you blame yourself for.

35:58.950 --> 36:01.720
But because you insisted
on going to see Judy,

36:01.720 --> 36:04.490
instead of
cashing that ticket,

36:04.490 --> 36:06.760
a life has been saved.

36:08.430 --> 36:09.430
- He's right, Sameer.

36:09.430 --> 36:11.400
Because of you,

36:11.400 --> 36:13.400
Judy's gonna be okay.

36:13.400 --> 36:16.800
- What about us?

36:16.800 --> 36:19.910
- We will be too.
- Sameer...

36:19.910 --> 36:23.440
It's time for you
to move forward.

36:30.050 --> 36:33.220
- You're right.

36:33.220 --> 36:34.690
Thank you.

36:43.330 --> 36:45.230
- For as long as I
can remember,

36:45.230 --> 36:46.360
I've wanted to help people.

36:46.360 --> 36:48.870
And for the last several years,

36:48.870 --> 36:51.540
I was certain of my path
to becoming a therapist.

36:51.540 --> 36:54.840
But lately,
I've been feeling lost;

36:56.040 --> 36:58.280
feeling alone.

37:04.850 --> 37:06.380
But standing in this church,

37:06.380 --> 37:09.250
looking out on this community,

37:09.250 --> 37:12.990
my community,
I realize,

37:12.990 --> 37:15.260
how could I be lost?

37:15.260 --> 37:18.300
How could I be alone?

37:21.400 --> 37:24.570
"For I know the plans
I have for you."

37:24.570 --> 37:26.910
"Plans to give you hope
and a future."

37:26.910 --> 37:30.440
So, how could I worry about
a future that in my heart...

37:30.440 --> 37:33.510
I've always known
has been guided by God.

37:33.510 --> 37:37.050
Thank you.

37:42.020 --> 37:43.890
- That was beautiful,
sweetheart.

37:43.890 --> 37:46.160
- What are you doing here?
- Well, Pastor Olivia

37:46.160 --> 37:48.560
was nice enough to let me
know that you were speaking,

37:48.560 --> 37:50.860
and I'm very glad she did.

37:50.860 --> 37:53.500
"For I know the plans
I have for you"?

37:53.500 --> 37:56.400
"Plans to give you a hope
and a future."

37:56.400 --> 37:59.000
Jeremiah 29:11.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.340
One of my favorites.
- I know.

38:05.140 --> 38:08.550
- Trish is supposed to be
a part of your future, Dad.

38:08.550 --> 38:10.050
- I know.

38:10.050 --> 38:11.620
- Then what are you
gonna do to fix it?

38:11.620 --> 38:13.990
- I'm going to call her

38:13.990 --> 38:16.150
and convince her
to come back home,

38:16.150 --> 38:17.490
today.

38:19.920 --> 38:21.190
- That was terrific, Ali.

38:21.190 --> 38:23.190
- Thank you, I mean,
you were right.

38:23.190 --> 38:25.230
That was exactly what I needed.
- Well, I would say

38:25.230 --> 38:28.270
I'm surprised how natural
you were up there, but...

38:28.270 --> 38:29.900
like father, like daughter.

38:29.900 --> 38:31.140
Maybe the path you're looking

38:31.140 --> 38:33.200
for isn't as surprising
as you think.

38:38.510 --> 38:40.080
- Cause and effect

38:40.080 --> 38:42.950
is a part
of our everyday lives.

38:42.950 --> 38:44.950
It doesn't matter
what we call it.

38:44.950 --> 38:47.420
We take actions;
there are consequences.

38:47.420 --> 38:51.560
Sometimes the results
can be surprising.

38:51.560 --> 38:54.490
- I'm gonna miss this place.
- So am I.

38:54.490 --> 38:56.160
But we still
have each other.

38:57.160 --> 38:59.160
- We'll rebuild,

38:59.160 --> 39:00.500
together.

39:00.500 --> 39:04.570
- ♪ I will send out an army ♪

39:04.570 --> 39:08.410
- It can send us down a path
we never thought to explore...

39:08.410 --> 39:11.240
- ♪ In the middle of
the darkest night ♪

39:11.240 --> 39:12.980
♪ It's true ♪

39:12.980 --> 39:17.120
- Or awaken us to a truth
we've known all along.

39:17.120 --> 39:19.450
- Trish, uh, it's--it's me.

39:19.450 --> 39:22.120
Can--can we talk?

39:22.120 --> 39:25.460
- Things never turn out
exactly how we planned.

39:30.360 --> 39:32.530
- Hey, Rakesh.
- Hey.

39:32.530 --> 39:35.230
So, uh...
who's Kamal Basu?

39:35.230 --> 39:36.300
- He's no one.

39:36.300 --> 39:38.140
- You mind telling me
why no one's

39:38.140 --> 39:40.140
looking forward to
having dinner with you tonight?

39:40.140 --> 39:42.610
- You know my parents.
This is what they do.

39:42.610 --> 39:45.210
I promise you, you have
nothing to worry about, okay?

39:45.210 --> 39:47.550
- But in the end,

39:47.550 --> 39:51.350
all we have to do is control
what we put out into the world

39:51.350 --> 39:54.520
and hope what's returned
makes it all worth it.

39:54.520 --> 39:56.450
- ♪ Reach you ♪

39:56.450 --> 39:58.490

40:11.370 --> 40:13.970

40:13.970 --> 40:15.970
- Hey, what's this for?

40:15.970 --> 40:19.380
- Do you remember
our last night in Paris?

40:20.040 --> 40:22.050
- How could I forget?

40:22.050 --> 40:24.580
- And do you remember
what you said to me?

40:24.580 --> 40:26.220
- I do.

40:26.220 --> 40:30.260
- Standing under the
Eiffel Tower, it was perfect.

40:30.260 --> 40:34.090
And while I know that can never
be duplicated, I...

40:34.760 --> 40:38.600
Thought I'd at least
give it a try.

41:07.730 --> 41:09.090

41:09.090 --> 41:10.760
- So what'd you wanna
see me about?

41:10.760 --> 41:12.360
- I traced
those dummy emails

41:12.360 --> 41:14.070
you wanted me to look at
for your story.

41:14.070 --> 41:16.100
They're all registered
to the same guy:

41:16.100 --> 41:17.800
Jonathan Carter.
You heard of him?

41:17.800 --> 41:20.240
- No--no, but
I'm definitely gonna find him.

41:20.240 --> 41:21.270
- Hi!

41:21.270 --> 41:22.610
You're all here.

41:22.610 --> 41:24.140
- Hey, what are you
doing here?

41:24.140 --> 41:26.510
- I'm headed out of town
and came to say good-bye,

41:26.510 --> 41:28.710
but I guess I like you guys.

41:28.710 --> 41:30.720
If you're ever back in Paris
for one of those

41:30.720 --> 41:33.450
God Account thingies,
look me up.

41:33.450 --> 41:35.620
- You just want to know
if we were able

41:35.620 --> 41:37.620
to crack the 11-digit code.
- Maybe.

41:37.620 --> 41:38.990
- Well, we didn't.

41:41.430 --> 41:44.300
- Hey, Patel & Sons
just posted a new photo

41:44.300 --> 41:46.360
that the God Account liked.
- Hm.

41:46.360 --> 41:48.830
- Aw, it's of Judy
and her hospital wristband...

41:48.830 --> 41:51.670
saying these are
her new lucky numbers.

41:51.670 --> 41:52.800
- Wait a minute.

41:52.800 --> 41:54.440
Lucky numbers?

41:56.440 --> 41:57.680
- It's 11 digits.

42:02.680 --> 42:05.350
- Zero, nine, two, five, seven,

42:05.350 --> 42:09.150
two, one, zero, three, four,
eight.

42:24.700 --> 42:26.300
- A house.

42:27.210 --> 42:28.570
How is a house a message?

42:28.570 --> 42:32.510
Not to mention, it could
be anywhere in the world.

42:32.510 --> 42:34.280
- It's not.

42:34.280 --> 42:37.220
It's in Jersey.

42:37.220 --> 42:39.320
- Mm-hmm.
- How do you know that?

42:39.320 --> 42:40.720
- Because that's
the first place that

42:40.720 --> 42:42.250
Cara and I tracked
the God Account to

42:42.250 --> 42:43.620
all the way back when this
first started.

42:43.620 --> 42:46.190
- Yeah, but why is it
sending us there now?

42:46.190 --> 42:48.660
- I don't know, but that's
what we're gonna find out.

43:21.190 --> 43:23.760
- Greg, move your head.
- I have an idea!
