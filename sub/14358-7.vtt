WEBVTT

00:00.653 --> 00:03.021
"The Scratch"

00:03.322 --> 00:04.458
(crows cawing)

00:05.145 --> 00:06.069
FRANKIE:
<i>From the outside,</i>

00:06.104 --> 00:07.915
<i>you can see we're just</i>
<i>your average family.</i>

00:08.195 --> 00:09.878
<i>Sure, we're</i>
<i>a little disorganized.</i>

00:09.879 --> 00:11.497
- (beeping)
- Is that the garbage truck?

00:12.680 --> 00:14.157
What time is it?

00:16.103 --> 00:17.580
Mike, did you
take out the trash?

00:17.940 --> 00:19.425
It's Axl's turn.

00:20.177 --> 00:21.592
(sighs)

00:24.895 --> 00:28.293
Trash day!
Bring out your trash!

00:28.328 --> 00:30.883
Come on, guys, move!
Trash truck's a block away!

00:30.918 --> 00:33.462
<i>Okay, okay. I know it probably</i>
<i>looks a little insane</i>

00:33.497 --> 00:35.855
<i>to be so nuts about Trash Day,</i>
<i>but see,</i>

00:35.890 --> 00:38.308
<i>due to recent cutbacks,</i>
<i>trash pickup only happens</i>

00:38.343 --> 00:39.442
<i>once every two weeks.</i>

00:39.477 --> 00:41.299
<i>If you miss it,</i>
<i>you're screwed.</i>

00:41.334 --> 00:42.929
We're never gonna make it!

00:45.873 --> 00:47.210
Brick, what are you doing
under there?

00:47.517 --> 00:50.905
I'm tired of sleeping with Axl.
His bed's always squeaking.

00:50.940 --> 00:52.073
I want my own room.

00:52.074 --> 00:53.698
How long have you been
sleeping under there?

00:54.050 --> 00:54.822
A month.

00:55.324 --> 00:57.515
All right, whatever.
Just get rid of your trash.

00:59.516 --> 01:02.693
You know, I don't understand
why nobody obeys the chore chart.

01:02.728 --> 01:04.066
Axl was supposed
to take out the garbage.

01:04.117 --> 01:05.413
Sue was supposed
to clean up last night.

01:05.414 --> 01:07.408
I mean, why do we even bother
making a chore chart

01:07.468 --> 01:09.125
if nobody pays
any attention to it?

01:09.126 --> 01:10.641
There's nothing on it!

01:10.642 --> 01:11.165
Yeah.

01:11.215 --> 01:13.602
Because I haven't bought
the dry-erase markers yet.

01:13.699 --> 01:14.653
But it's all up here,

01:14.723 --> 01:16.926
and you're supposed to
remember what I told you.

01:18.264 --> 01:21.044
I swear, I spend my whole life
cleaning up other people's crap.

01:21.380 --> 01:22.211
Ow!

01:22.814 --> 01:25.130
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

01:26.214 --> 01:27.489
Are you all right?

01:27.524 --> 01:29.348
Hey, guys, the truck's
passing the Donahues'.

01:29.609 --> 01:31.657
- Mom hit me with a beer bottle.
- What?

01:31.677 --> 01:34.079
Brick, don't tell people that.
It sounds horrible.

01:34.080 --> 01:36.367
I was tossing it to Sue,
and Brick got in the way.

01:36.368 --> 01:38.105
Let me see that.
No, you're fine.

01:38.106 --> 01:41.043
- He's all right?
- Yeah. Barely even a scratch.

01:41.078 --> 01:42.161
He's not bleeding
or anything.

01:42.203 --> 01:43.034
I'm sorry, honey.

01:43.365 --> 01:47.189
Darn. I wanted a band-aid.
Can I put a band-aid on anyway?

01:47.224 --> 01:49.174
I want to use
the new Super Mario ones.

01:49.537 --> 01:51.100
(whispers)
<i>Super Mario.</i>

01:51.135 --> 01:52.999
Okay, that's fine, honey.
Mike, come on!

01:53.034 --> 01:54.984
We can do this!
We can do this! Hurry up!

01:55.177 --> 01:57.349
We did it!
We made it! We...

02:01.371 --> 02:02.044
(dog barking)

02:02.240 --> 02:05.347
<i>The day started off lousy,</i>
<i>and then it got weird.</i>

02:05.382 --> 02:07.815
<i>So</i> out of the goodness
of my heart,

02:07.850 --> 02:09.481
I'm gonna reach
into my own wallet,

02:09.482 --> 02:12.091
and instead of buying
that second pontoon boat,

02:12.126 --> 02:15.195
I'm gonna spend the money
on buying some TV ad time.

02:15.837 --> 02:18.443
I decided to dust off
my old commercial

02:18.806 --> 02:22.987
from when we were up to
our jockstraps in good times.

02:23.022 --> 02:26.600
<i>Help! Help! I'm being</i>
<i>assaulted by high prices!</i>

02:27.004 --> 02:28.750
<i>Just keep cool, little lady.</i>

02:29.160 --> 02:30.978
<i>I'm Don Ehlert</i>
<i>of Ehlert Motors,</i>

02:31.013 --> 02:33.563
<i>and they're not gonna get</i>
<i>away with that on my lot.</i>

02:33.573 --> 02:35.910
<i>(funk music playing)</i>

02:36.973 --> 02:38.243
<i>(bangs)</i>

02:38.442 --> 02:40.178
<i>I'm shooting down</i>
<i>high prices...</i>

02:40.179 --> 02:41.546
- <i>(gunshot)</i>
- <i>Ooh!</i>

02:43.752 --> 02:45.081
<i>And bad service.</i>

02:45.116 --> 02:46.718
- <i>(bang)</i>
- <i>Aah! Ooh!</i>

02:48.985 --> 02:49.943
(click)

02:51.521 --> 02:52.190
(blows air)

02:52.792 --> 02:54.125
Uh, Mr. Ehlert,

02:54.809 --> 02:57.699
you can't run
that commercial.

02:57.989 --> 02:59.343
It's racist.

02:59.378 --> 03:00.449
What are you
talking about?

03:00.867 --> 03:02.345
I'm shooting high prices.

03:02.869 --> 03:04.635
It's racist
to shoot high prices?

03:04.670 --> 03:08.495
When high prices is
a... black man, yes, sir.

03:08.530 --> 03:11.386
I just think maybe
if you made a new commercial,

03:11.421 --> 03:15.061
you might appeal to an entirely
new group of people--

03:15.096 --> 03:17.562
You know, young people...

03:17.683 --> 03:19.493
Non-racists.

03:20.321 --> 03:22.129
You two write me up
a new commercial

03:22.164 --> 03:24.066
and have it on my desk
tomorrow morning.

03:25.802 --> 03:29.242
MAN ON P.A.: <i>Frankie,</i>
<i>you have a call on line one.</i>

03:29.592 --> 03:32.854
<i>Your son Brick's school</i>
<i>is on line one.</i>

03:32.889 --> 03:35.922
Well, I'm working, too.
Besides, it's your turn.

03:35.957 --> 03:38.289
I went down to the school
when Axl pantsed the band kids.

03:38.324 --> 03:39.997
I did Sue
and the squirrel attack.

03:40.032 --> 03:41.101
Brick and the chalk-chewing.

03:41.421 --> 03:42.798
Brick and the lying down
in class.

03:42.888 --> 03:45.847
Brick and the beeping in class.
Brick and the <i>howling</i> in class.

03:46.190 --> 03:46.833
Brick and the...

03:47.274 --> 03:49.112
Hi. I'm Brick Heck's dad.
What did he do this time,

03:49.147 --> 03:51.469
forget his lunch? We're in
kind of a hurry this morning.

03:54.155 --> 03:54.778
Thank you.

03:58.129 --> 04:00.114
- What's going on here?
- You tell me.

04:00.738 --> 04:02.611
I hear your wife
got a little rough

04:02.646 --> 04:03.871
with your son
this morning.

04:04.363 --> 04:06.791
What?
Are you joking?

04:07.081 --> 04:08.326
You guys strippers
or something?

04:08.367 --> 04:11.812
No, I'm afraid not. We got
a call from the hall monitor.

04:11.847 --> 04:14.179
He said that your--
your son told him

04:14.214 --> 04:16.317
that his mother hit him
with a beer bottle.

04:16.507 --> 04:17.358
(exhales deeply)

04:17.997 --> 04:18.861
Hi, Dad!

04:22.462 --> 04:25.202
Guys, this is all
a huge misunderstanding.

04:25.237 --> 04:27.820
- It was an accident.
- Relax, Mr. Heck. Just stay calm.

04:28.081 --> 04:31.081
When parents are stressed,
lapses in judgment can occur.

04:31.116 --> 04:33.512
<i>Tell me about it.</i>
<i>We should never have let Brick</i>

04:33.547 --> 04:35.273
<i>anywhere near</i>
<i>the first aid kit.</i>

04:39.272 --> 04:40.608
(whistling)

04:45.495 --> 04:46.650
MIKE: It's tiny.

04:46.685 --> 04:47.625
It's not even a scratch.

04:47.660 --> 04:48.953
Here, Brick,
unwrap it and show 'em.

04:48.988 --> 04:51.620
Sir, we can't allow you
to talk directly to your son.

04:51.817 --> 04:52.257
What?

04:53.346 --> 04:54.362
Is this for real?

04:54.401 --> 04:55.948
<i>Oh, it was for real,</i>
<i>all right.</i>

04:56.563 --> 04:57.761
<i>It started with the bandage</i>

04:57.796 --> 04:59.557
<i>and then just snowballed</i>
<i>from there.</i>

04:59.813 --> 05:02.916
<i>It didn't help that there was</i>
<i>a new hall monitor at school.</i>

05:02.951 --> 05:04.963
Hey, buddy.
What happened to your arm?

05:04.998 --> 05:06.630
I'm not supposed
to tell.

05:06.665 --> 05:07.398
What do you mean?

05:07.458 --> 05:09.031
My mom says
I'm not supposed to tell.

05:09.066 --> 05:10.948
Well, if something
happened at home,

05:10.983 --> 05:12.293
you have
to tell a grown-up.

05:12.328 --> 05:14.396
Okay. My mom hit me
with a beer bottle.

05:14.796 --> 05:17.524
She was mad, and my dad was mad,
and I always get in the way.

05:17.760 --> 05:19.586
<i>You can see</i>
<i>how this sounded.</i>

05:19.621 --> 05:22.548
<i>Everyone could see</i>
<i>how it sounded, except Brick.</i>

05:22.919 --> 05:25.076
<i>And once a teacher hears</i>
<i>something like that,</i>

05:25.111 --> 05:27.175
<i>he's legally required</i>
<i>to report it.</i>

05:27.357 --> 05:29.821
Now I realize this may be
uncomfortable for you

05:29.856 --> 05:30.986
to talk about, Mr. Heck,

05:31.021 --> 05:33.765
but has your wife ever been
physically abusive to you?

05:33.951 --> 05:36.249
(chuckles) Are you kidding?
She's, like, 5 feet tall.

05:36.284 --> 05:37.252
I could kick her ass.

05:37.302 --> 05:39.679
And do you ever
kick... her ass?

05:39.714 --> 05:41.909
No. No, of course not.

05:41.944 --> 05:42.911
- (chuckles)
- (door closes)

05:43.303 --> 05:44.386
Oh, Mike.
Got your message.

05:44.421 --> 05:46.284
Hi, honey. Lookit.
See how little she is?

05:46.319 --> 05:47.375
Take your shoes off, hon.

05:47.376 --> 05:47.835
Oh.

05:47.917 --> 05:51.118
Sorry, Mom. You told me
not to tell, but I told.

05:51.458 --> 05:54.890
- Don't be mad.
- Mad? No! Why would I be mad?

05:54.925 --> 05:56.977
I am never mad,
never, ever, ever.

05:57.751 --> 05:59.767
This is all
a huge misunderstanding.

05:59.802 --> 06:02.788
The beer bottle hit him
when I tossed it gently--

06:02.823 --> 06:04.206
Just oh, so gently--

06:04.241 --> 06:06.233
And do you often
drink in the morning?

06:06.268 --> 06:08.310
No. I think that was
my husband's beer bottle.

06:08.642 --> 06:10.677
Mr. Heck, you're the one
who drinks in the morning?

06:11.001 --> 06:13.429
(sighs) No.
God, this is ridiculous.

06:13.464 --> 06:14.865
Look--hey, you know what?

06:14.900 --> 06:18.112
We have a teenage son that is
a huge pain in the butt.

06:18.147 --> 06:19.840
Don't you think if we wanted
to abuse somebody,

06:19.901 --> 06:20.908
we would have
abused him?

06:21.059 --> 06:24.132
Officer McCoy, if I could
please step in here?

06:24.552 --> 06:26.512
I have known this family
for years...

06:26.837 --> 06:28.048
Years and years
and years.

06:28.083 --> 06:30.068
And although they don't help
with fund-raisers...

06:30.103 --> 06:30.288
We work.

06:30.289 --> 06:33.712
Or teacher appreciation day
or the back-to-school picnic,

06:33.747 --> 06:35.660
they are
a good family.

06:37.614 --> 06:40.373
Well, since the principal
feels so strongly about this,

06:40.705 --> 06:42.721
we'll release him
back into your custody.

06:42.756 --> 06:43.690
(exhales)

06:43.780 --> 06:46.123
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

06:46.500 --> 06:49.482
Okay. So we're all done here?
Everything's cleared up?

06:49.517 --> 06:51.069
Oh, no.
You're in the system now.

06:51.104 --> 06:52.579
A social worker will
be coming by your house

06:52.628 --> 06:54.191
to make
an official evaluation.

06:57.343 --> 06:59.188
<i>You know all those times</i>
<i>you wished someone would come</i>

06:59.223 --> 07:00.341
<i>and take</i>
<i>your kids away?</i>

07:00.703 --> 07:02.363
<i>Well, the reality isn't really</i>

07:02.398 --> 07:03.698
- <i>as great as the fantasy.</i>
SUE: Okay.

07:03.733 --> 07:06.414
So the social worker's
coming tomorrow afternoon

07:06.449 --> 07:07.539
for the home visit.

07:07.750 --> 07:10.258
So if I tell the social worker
that you hit me, too,

07:10.566 --> 07:11.738
does that mean
that I can, like,

07:11.773 --> 07:13.842
trade up to a better
foster family or...

07:14.333 --> 07:17.455
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
They're gonna split us up!

07:17.696 --> 07:19.630
They're gonna
take us away!

07:19.665 --> 07:22.082
Relax. Nobody's taking
anybody anywhere.

07:22.117 --> 07:24.844
This is a formality so they
can sign their paperwork.

07:25.017 --> 07:26.012
We're gonna answer
their questions.

07:26.083 --> 07:27.709
Brick's gonna tell them
what really happened,

07:27.744 --> 07:30.208
and they're gonna see what
a normal family we really are.

07:31.070 --> 07:33.559
Can I have dinner here
in my room tonight?

07:34.171 --> 07:35.962
<i>And at that moment,</i>
<i>it dawned on us</i>

07:35.997 --> 07:38.573
<i>that our future rested</i>
<i>in Brick's hands.</i>

07:38.698 --> 07:39.938
<i>God help us.</i>

07:40.466 --> 07:44.024
So, Brick, your dad and I
thought it might be fun

07:44.059 --> 07:46.095
to have a little practice run
at some of the questions

07:46.130 --> 07:47.474
the social worker
might ask you.

07:48.116 --> 07:48.659
Sprinkles?

07:48.908 --> 07:50.089
- Okay.
- Okay.

07:50.743 --> 07:51.677
There you go.

07:51.678 --> 07:54.198
So for example,
uh, what would you say

07:54.233 --> 07:55.961
if she asked you if your mom
ever hits you?

07:55.996 --> 07:57.229
Not deliberately.

07:57.230 --> 07:59.214
Okay.
That's a good answer.

07:59.719 --> 08:02.695
But you know what's
a good answer, too? "No."

08:03.739 --> 08:05.386
Just... no.

08:05.938 --> 08:06.603
No is good.

08:06.653 --> 08:07.928
Keep it brief.
Keep it simple.

08:07.978 --> 08:09.213
Okay. I'll just tell her

08:09.248 --> 08:10.545
whatever you tell me
I should say.

08:10.997 --> 08:11.167
But--

08:11.202 --> 08:13.827
Well, you wouldn't want her
to think that we're coaching you.

08:13.933 --> 08:15.158
But aren't you
coaching me?

08:15.159 --> 08:16.511
What, this? No.

08:16.945 --> 08:18.221
(scoffs)
This isn't coaching.

08:18.404 --> 08:19.590
No, we're just practicing.

08:20.806 --> 08:22.166
Okay, so to recap,

08:22.350 --> 08:25.200
if she asks you
if we were coaching you,

08:25.235 --> 08:25.982
you would say...

08:26.412 --> 08:28.248
- Yes.
- Gosh, you know,

08:28.317 --> 08:31.250
I think you could say no
for that question, too.

08:31.285 --> 08:31.974
What do you think?

08:32.157 --> 08:34.025
I'm liking no
as a go-to answer.

08:34.187 --> 08:36.657
So you're telling me to lie?
Okay.

08:36.688 --> 08:39.621
No, no, no.
Nobody is telling you to lie.

08:39.792 --> 08:43.160
I think we're just <i>bending</i>
the immediate truth

08:43.162 --> 08:45.102
just a teeny, teeny bit

08:45.469 --> 08:48.911
to get to the truth
that is the true truth.

08:49.545 --> 08:50.351
You understand?

08:50.436 --> 08:51.585
- No.
- You don't?

08:51.586 --> 08:54.457
I don't know. But you said no
was my go-to answer.

08:54.674 --> 08:56.105
Can I go watch TV now?

08:56.106 --> 08:56.762
(sighs)

08:56.797 --> 08:57.284
Sure.

09:00.263 --> 09:01.468
What do you think?

09:01.614 --> 09:03.233
I hope he goes
to a nice family.

09:05.218 --> 09:08.149
<i>Well, I wasn't the only one</i>
<i>stuck in a scary situation</i>

09:08.184 --> 09:09.123
<i>I didn't deserve.</i>

09:09.124 --> 09:10.921
All right, let's get
this show on the road.

09:11.557 --> 09:12.390
Where's Frances?

09:12.925 --> 09:16.196
Um, actually, she had
some, uh, family issues.

09:16.229 --> 09:17.460
And I know she's lied
in the past

09:17.500 --> 09:19.823
and said she had
some family issues, but...

09:19.996 --> 09:21.315
this time she really does.

09:21.316 --> 09:22.944
- All right, let's kick this pig.
- Okay.

09:24.937 --> 09:25.645
Action!

09:26.405 --> 09:28.340
And down here, we got...

09:29.255 --> 09:29.898
Damn it.

09:30.343 --> 09:31.969
- (beep)
- And down here, we got--

09:32.049 --> 09:33.626
What the hell
is my hand doing?

09:34.547 --> 09:35.680
Doesn't feel natural.

09:35.681 --> 09:37.234
I don't know what to do
with my damn hand.

09:37.417 --> 09:38.650
- (beep)
- And down here, we've got--

09:38.709 --> 09:40.913
That's not right,
is it? Eh.

09:41.153 --> 09:43.121
And down--
Oh, screw this!

09:43.603 --> 09:44.618
What are you lookin' at?!

09:44.696 --> 09:45.899
- (beep)
- Quiet!

09:46.059 --> 09:47.329
- (beep)
- Ehlert Motors,

09:47.409 --> 09:49.297
where your
every need will be...

09:49.332 --> 09:51.463
- (insect buzzing)
- Where your every need will...

09:51.897 --> 09:52.588
- Ah...
- (horn honks)

09:53.151 --> 09:54.334
- This...
- (horn honks)

09:54.763 --> 09:57.511
This is your fault.
The words you wrote are clumsy.

09:57.562 --> 09:59.142
- They don't roll off the tongue.
- Um...

09:59.373 --> 10:01.592
Yeah, like this.
What the hell is that?

10:02.283 --> 10:02.915
"Vehicle"?

10:03.064 --> 10:05.222
Yeah, that's fancy.
I don't talk like that.

10:05.257 --> 10:06.856
Aah! Are you
gonna help me,

10:06.891 --> 10:08.048
or are you gonna
just stand there?

10:09.373 --> 10:11.812
<i>So the day of the social worker</i>
<i>visit had arrived,</i>

10:11.847 --> 10:13.838
<i>and we all pulled together</i>
<i>to make a good impression.</i>

10:15.406 --> 10:16.403
How do I look?

10:16.438 --> 10:18.553
Take that off.
Damn it, Axl, take it off!

10:18.760 --> 10:21.532
- (chuckles) Don't hit me.
- Not funny, Axl. Not funny.

10:23.733 --> 10:24.712
(crying)

10:25.404 --> 10:26.032
Hey.

10:26.553 --> 10:27.346
Why are you crying?

10:27.406 --> 10:28.694
I'm just so scared.

10:29.201 --> 10:30.870
Honey, I'm gonna give you
a piece of advice

10:30.905 --> 10:32.296
that my dad
gave me once.

10:32.473 --> 10:35.639
He said, "Son,
stuff those feelings down.

10:35.674 --> 10:38.205
Stuff 'em down,
and eventually they'll go away."

10:38.426 --> 10:39.944
And I have not cried since.

10:42.411 --> 10:44.720
Okay, what do you think?
Shades open or closed?

10:44.755 --> 10:46.539
No. Closed looks like
we're hiding something.

10:46.574 --> 10:47.623
Open. Open.

10:49.355 --> 10:49.889
(gasps)

10:49.991 --> 10:51.656
Oh, my God. The raccoons
tore into the garbage

10:51.691 --> 10:52.726
that never got picked up.

10:53.047 --> 10:54.264
Sue, get out there
and clean that up.

10:56.181 --> 10:58.609
Okay,
<i>where</i> is the Bible?

10:58.610 --> 11:00.476
I wanna put it
on the coffee table.

11:00.511 --> 11:02.400
You know, we don't have
a real book anywhere--

11:02.458 --> 11:07.183
Just "People" magazine.
Mike, quick, turn all the TVs to PBS.

11:09.340 --> 11:11.616
- What channel is that?
- I don't know.

11:11.617 --> 11:12.571
(doorbell rings)

11:13.815 --> 11:14.621
She's here.

11:17.243 --> 11:20.962
Oh! Oh! You see?
It's clean!

11:20.997 --> 11:22.639
That's why
I never wash the windows.

11:22.972 --> 11:25.350
Oh, are you okay?
Oh, my God.

11:25.385 --> 11:29.022
Listen, you can't get a welt
on your head. Not now.

11:29.435 --> 11:32.418
Okay, don't swell up, Sue.
Don't swell.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.386
What are we gonna do?

11:38.372 --> 11:41.079
(sighs) It's very nice
to meet you.

11:41.114 --> 11:43.297
It's very nice
to meet you, too.

11:49.181 --> 11:50.265
Her head gets cold.

11:50.300 --> 11:50.975
(chuckles)

11:53.452 --> 11:56.544
It's so nice to have
you here, really.

11:56.579 --> 11:57.588
- It's very--
- Yes, it's very nice.

11:57.623 --> 11:58.582
I'm sorry. Go ahead.

11:59.530 --> 12:00.968
Oh, no, no. You--
That was your--

12:01.003 --> 12:04.224
No, I interrupted. It's my fault.
Please, honey. You go.

12:04.532 --> 12:05.298
Thank you, dear.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.415
It's just nice
to have you here.

12:07.416 --> 12:09.141
- (clears throat)
- It really is.

12:09.411 --> 12:10.694
Can I get you
something to drink?

12:10.729 --> 12:12.534
Oh, I'd love
some herbal tea.

12:12.588 --> 12:14.439
Oh, no.
I don't have herbal tea.

12:14.907 --> 12:15.962
I mean, I-I know
it's good for you,

12:16.003 --> 12:17.801
but I just don't like it.
I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

12:17.872 --> 12:18.877
I don't have herbal tea.

12:19.859 --> 12:22.406
(crying)

12:22.794 --> 12:26.196
Oh. Honestly, it's okay.
Look, don't worry.

12:26.231 --> 12:29.649
It's--it's better if everyone
just stays relaxed, okay?

12:29.684 --> 12:31.502
So I'm gonna need
to speak

12:31.537 --> 12:33.878
with each member
of the family individually.

12:33.913 --> 12:35.866
Great.
That sounds great.

12:35.901 --> 12:36.686
We're not nervous.

12:36.747 --> 12:38.774
(laughs loudly)

12:39.681 --> 12:41.649
So how many hours a day
would you say

12:41.650 --> 12:43.038
that you spend together
as a family?

12:43.786 --> 12:46.524
Just about every chance we get.
We love spending time together.

12:46.596 --> 12:48.322
We're together
all the time.

12:49.327 --> 12:50.162
Two.

12:50.225 --> 12:52.823
(voice breaking) I-I don't know.
What's--what's the right answer?

12:52.858 --> 12:54.254
So what are
foster families like?

12:54.293 --> 12:56.698
Are there any with, like,
inground pools or...

12:56.932 --> 13:00.388
Would you say that you drink
alcohol on a regular basis?

13:00.402 --> 13:03.797
(chuckles) Oh, no, not at all.
Hardly ever.

13:03.872 --> 13:06.625
Three times a week.
More if the Colts are losing.

13:06.642 --> 13:08.936
I just love my family
so much.

13:09.044 --> 13:10.564
Are there
any foster families available

13:10.599 --> 13:11.877
with cute teenage girls?

13:11.878 --> 13:13.894
'Cause they wouldn't be
considered my sisters, right?

13:14.817 --> 13:16.651
CAROLE: Does your wife
ever get angry?

13:17.627 --> 13:18.854
Uh...

13:18.965 --> 13:20.220
Uh...

13:20.299 --> 13:21.189
Uh...

13:21.190 --> 13:22.442
Uh...

13:22.624 --> 13:25.348
And what do you do
as a family for fun?

13:25.383 --> 13:27.422
Oh, uh, biking, canoeing,

13:27.457 --> 13:30.150
visiting ancient
Native American historical sites

13:30.185 --> 13:31.232
and looking for arrowheads.

13:31.233 --> 13:32.934
- Watch TV.
- Watch TV.

13:32.935 --> 13:36.724
Watch TV? I don't know.
Is that the right answer?

13:37.005 --> 13:40.596
(voice breaking) I just--
I just love my family so much!

13:41.143 --> 13:43.243
Okay.
Brick is up next.

13:43.752 --> 13:46.414
<i>Yep, our future</i>
<i>was in his hands.</i>

13:46.815 --> 13:48.779
Brick, would you like
to show me to your room?

13:49.108 --> 13:49.690
Okay.

13:51.657 --> 13:52.850
(coughs)

13:53.904 --> 13:56.543
Let me show you the room
that I share with my brother.

14:00.398 --> 14:02.081
<i>It wasn't going well</i>
<i>for me,</i>

14:02.116 --> 14:04.089
<i>and it wasn't going well</i>
<i>for Bob either.</i>

14:04.266 --> 14:06.011
It's Don Ehlert
of Ehlert Motors.

14:06.134 --> 14:08.069
Need a vehicle?
Got bad credit?

14:08.070 --> 14:09.858
We don't care.
Come on down.

14:09.938 --> 14:12.006
We've got the lowest prices
south of Canada.

14:12.351 --> 14:15.201
Follow the arrows! Follow
the signs to Ehlert Motors.

14:16.341 --> 14:17.807
Mr. Ehlert, you did it!

14:18.490 --> 14:19.714
You made it through
the whole thing!

14:19.790 --> 14:23.745
I did? Ha! I did! Well,
let me see it. Play it back.

14:24.748 --> 14:25.638
(speaks indistinctly)

14:26.021 --> 14:28.055
<i>It's Don Ehlert</i>
<i>of Ehlert Motors...</i>

14:28.461 --> 14:30.958
What the hell is this?
I don't look like that.

14:31.385 --> 14:34.829
You made me look old
and bald and... old!

14:34.830 --> 14:35.665
No. He's...

14:35.785 --> 14:38.418
In my old commercial,
I was beautiful, Bob!

14:38.800 --> 14:39.793
What'd you do to me?

14:41.603 --> 14:42.694
(stammers)

14:43.938 --> 14:45.070
Sir, well, you...

14:46.962 --> 14:48.077
DON: Jackass.

14:49.402 --> 14:50.698
It's been a long time.

14:51.103 --> 14:52.476
Wonder how Brick's doing
in there.

14:52.940 --> 14:53.748
(whimpers)

14:53.749 --> 14:57.376
Do not start to cry again, Sue.
I swear, I will--

14:57.411 --> 14:59.915
Thank you, Brick. It was
very nice to meet you, too.

15:02.192 --> 15:03.092
Oh, are you done already?

15:03.525 --> 15:06.386
We were just reading some
Bible verses. How did it go?

15:06.421 --> 15:10.279
I told her everything that you
told me to--I mean, the truth.

15:10.966 --> 15:14.375
Well, I want to thank you all
for your honesty and candor.

15:14.436 --> 15:16.022
I think I have
everything I need,

15:16.083 --> 15:18.154
so I will be
contacting you shortly.

15:20.913 --> 15:21.761
Um, excuse me.

15:22.779 --> 15:25.279
I know you can't tell us
anything official right now,

15:25.280 --> 15:27.609
- but, um...
- Oh.

15:28.034 --> 15:29.308
(whispers)
I promise I won't tell.

15:29.343 --> 15:30.324
I'm sorry, Mrs. Heck.

15:30.382 --> 15:32.307
I'm not able to discuss
anything at this time

15:32.342 --> 15:33.662
until I file my report.

15:33.816 --> 15:36.463
(normal voice) I understand.
Of course. Um, so...

15:39.279 --> 15:40.695
It was lovely to meet you.

15:40.975 --> 15:41.742
Okay.

15:43.532 --> 15:44.691
It's funny, but...

15:45.500 --> 15:47.228
You don't remember me,
do you?

15:48.270 --> 15:50.138
Uh... Should I?

15:50.139 --> 15:52.673
Well, we went out,
like, two or three times.

15:52.674 --> 15:53.882
It was years ago.

15:54.443 --> 15:57.582
Anyway, I <i>really</i> liked you,
but you never called me back.

15:58.344 --> 15:59.056
Oh, well.

15:59.748 --> 16:00.973
It's nice
to see you again.

16:04.119 --> 16:05.086
(door closes)

16:10.530 --> 16:12.981
You dated our social worker?

16:13.016 --> 16:14.899
I don't even remember her.
Oh, wait.

16:15.721 --> 16:17.624
She could have been the one
that liked Duran Duran

16:17.659 --> 16:18.999
and was always
touching my face.

16:19.563 --> 16:20.907
Man, she got old.

16:21.087 --> 16:22.753
How could you not have
called her back?

16:23.085 --> 16:25.585
What's wrong with her?
She's attractive. She's smart.

16:26.006 --> 16:29.256
You should have called, Mike.
You shoulda called.

16:29.291 --> 16:31.470
I didn't call her
because I met you,

16:31.505 --> 16:32.484
and I liked you better.

16:32.519 --> 16:35.492
Well, if this whole thing goes south,
it's on <i>your</i> head.

16:35.527 --> 16:37.491
Frankie, she doesn't seem
like the vindictive type.

16:37.492 --> 16:39.769
Clearly, you know
nothing about women.

16:39.931 --> 16:42.852
Any scorned woman would <i>kill</i>
for this chance!

16:43.123 --> 16:44.794
We are screwed.

16:48.006 --> 16:48.430
(telephone ringing)

16:48.510 --> 16:50.322
<i>I tried to be</i>
<i>as mellow as Mike,</i>

16:50.323 --> 16:52.485
<i>but the truth is,</i>
<i>I was a basket case.</i>

16:52.682 --> 16:54.296
<i>What if this chick</i>
<i>was still mad at Mike</i>

16:54.347 --> 16:55.967
<i>and was gonna</i>
<i>take it out on us?</i>

16:56.330 --> 16:58.016
<i>Damn it, I was gonna</i>
<i>take some action.</i>

16:58.017 --> 16:59.259
WOMAN: <i>You've reached</i>
<i>the government offices</i>

16:59.340 --> 17:02.664
<i>of Social Services.</i>
<i>To schedule a hearing, press 1.</i>

17:02.913 --> 17:05.191
<i>To become a foster family,</i>
<i>press 2.</i>

17:05.226 --> 17:07.467
Hey, quick, everybody!
The new commercial's on.

17:08.021 --> 17:11.982
WOMAN: <i>Help! Help! I'm being</i>
<i>assaulted by high prices!</i>

17:12.017 --> 17:14.827
<i>(bang, bang)</i>
<i>I'm shooting down high prices!</i>

17:15.672 --> 17:16.503
<i>(groaning)</i>

17:16.863 --> 17:18.540
<i>(funk music playing)</i>

17:20.531 --> 17:23.669
That's it? Huh.
That must have been easy.

17:27.204 --> 17:29.886
<i>I tried for days to go</i>
<i>through proper channels,</i>

17:29.921 --> 17:31.342
<i>but I couldn't</i>
<i>wait any longer.</i>

17:31.377 --> 17:34.018
<i>Mike might not have pursued</i>
<i>her, but I sure was gonna.</i>

17:34.053 --> 17:36.638
Hi. I'd like to see
Carole Barry, please.

17:38.618 --> 17:39.518
Is she expecting you?

17:40.268 --> 17:43.097
Is anyone ever <i>really</i>
expecting anyone?

17:43.397 --> 17:44.542
And should we be?

17:44.658 --> 17:47.702
I mean, isn't being
surprised the most fun?

17:47.737 --> 17:51.275
So that's a no.
No appointment, no seeing.

17:51.310 --> 17:53.080
Now you can call
our 1-800 number--

17:53.129 --> 17:55.866
Uh, no, you really can't,
because I tried, and...

17:57.579 --> 18:00.998
- Can I just use your bathroom?
- Employees only.

18:01.033 --> 18:04.426
Oh, I--nervous bladder.
I have a doctor's note.

18:05.300 --> 18:06.393
Go. Go.

Ms. Barry?

18:21.661 --> 18:22.458
Yes?

18:23.413 --> 18:25.664
Hi. It's Frankie Heck.
(stammers)

18:26.070 --> 18:27.277
May I help you?

18:27.367 --> 18:32.405
Uh, well, I-I just
wanted to explain, um,

18:32.440 --> 18:35.385
why my husband Mike
never called you back.

18:35.726 --> 18:37.745
I mean, I'm sure you have been
wondering about it

18:37.780 --> 18:41.540
all these years,
'cause clearly you are lovely,

18:41.575 --> 18:43.936
and he liked you.
He really did.

18:43.971 --> 18:46.535
It's just that the timing
just wasn't right,

18:46.570 --> 18:49.876
because, you see, we met
going up to the Indy 500,

18:49.911 --> 18:51.257
and, um, well...

18:52.099 --> 18:53.284
(sighs)
To tell you the truth,

18:53.616 --> 18:57.631
um, I slept with him
on the second date,

18:58.189 --> 18:59.463
which I never
really do!

18:59.760 --> 19:01.694
But you know, I was
a nice girl then--

19:01.729 --> 19:05.084
As were you, I mean, obviously,
'cause you didn't put out.

19:05.369 --> 19:09.761
And good for you. So I just
hope that all of this

19:09.796 --> 19:13.373
doesn't make you think
differently about my family,

19:13.408 --> 19:14.707
- because--
- Frankie.

19:14.742 --> 19:15.711
- (sighs)
- (toilet flushes)

19:18.138 --> 19:20.178
I got over your husband
a long time ago.

19:20.213 --> 19:21.053
(sighs)

19:21.424 --> 19:22.076
Thank God.

19:22.525 --> 19:23.931
Well, you should
count your blessings,

19:23.966 --> 19:27.162
because believe me, he really
is no picnic to live with.

19:27.227 --> 19:31.539
But he's a good dad!
Oh, such a great dad.

19:32.911 --> 19:36.253
Frankie, I'm not supposed
to tell you any information

19:36.288 --> 19:37.613
until the report is filed.

19:38.304 --> 19:40.519
- But you're fine.
- We are?

19:40.607 --> 19:45.093
Do you have any idea the kind of
crazy families I see in my job?

19:45.128 --> 19:47.819
Trust me, meeting yours was
the best part of my week--

19:48.469 --> 19:49.922
- My month.
- Really?

19:50.183 --> 19:53.148
Really. As soon as I file
my report with my supervisor,

19:53.183 --> 19:54.720
your case will
be officially closed,

19:54.754 --> 19:57.036
and then you can go on
with your life.

19:57.071 --> 19:59.403
Oh, thank you.
Oh!

19:59.787 --> 20:01.380
I'm so sorry
to have bothered you.

20:01.415 --> 20:03.769
I promise you I will
not bother you again.

20:04.518 --> 20:05.944
<i>Actually, that was a lie.</i>

20:05.979 --> 20:09.184
<i>I couldn't go home without</i>
<i>actually seeing it in writing.</i>

20:09.219 --> 20:10.943
- (computer beeps)
- (speaks indistinctly)

20:15.074 --> 20:17.020
(mouths words)

20:18.172 --> 20:20.293
<i>I don't think I ever knew</i>
<i>what relief meant</i>

20:20.328 --> 20:21.470
<i>until that moment.</i>

20:21.851 --> 20:23.808
<i>There was an upside to all</i>
<i>that happened, though.</i>

20:24.289 --> 20:26.341
<i>I had written proof</i>
<i>that I was a good parent,</i>

20:26.376 --> 20:28.509
<i>and believe me,</i>
<i>it came in handy.</i>

20:29.101 --> 20:33.553
Whoa! I cannot believe that you
won't let me go car skiing.

20:33.823 --> 20:37.298
It's safe. There's a spotter car
that follows right behind.

20:39.895 --> 20:42.234
Oh, my God.
You are the worst mom ever.

20:42.609 --> 20:46.457
Really? The state of Indiana
seems to disagree.

20:47.359 --> 20:49.899
<i>Yep. It was good to have it</i>
<i>in writing.</i>
