00:28.429 --> 00:31.799
Guys, I stayed up all night
making this amazing video

00:31.832 --> 00:34.135
and I wanted to share it
with my closest friends.

00:34.168 --> 00:36.837
-Oh, wonderful.
-Well, share away, bro.

00:36.870 --> 00:39.707
Somebody's flexing
their creative muscles.

00:41.309 --> 00:42.310
Why not?

00:51.185 --> 00:54.688
ROBIN: Cyborg.
You know him as a superhero.

00:54.722 --> 00:57.191
Aw, you made
a video about me?

00:57.225 --> 00:58.626
Quiet.

00:58.659 --> 01:02.062
ROBIN: But did you
also know that Cyborg
is also a gigantic jerk?

01:02.363 --> 01:05.199
No, I did not know that.

01:05.233 --> 01:08.169
Just look at what
the security cameras
caught him saying

01:08.202 --> 01:10.504
about his best friend
Beast Boy.

01:11.205 --> 01:15.843
Dude, I think Beast Boy's
super lame and so annoying.

01:15.876 --> 01:16.877
Ah!

01:16.910 --> 01:19.347
Cyborg, how could you?

01:19.647 --> 01:21.215
What? I never said...

01:21.249 --> 01:22.683
That was taken out of context.

01:24.084 --> 01:27.121
And if you think that's bad,
just look what we
caught Beast Boy saying.

01:27.155 --> 01:31.192
Yeah, bro. Cyborg is gross
and stupid and super weird.

01:31.225 --> 01:32.226
What?

01:32.260 --> 01:34.795
You really
think I'm super weird?

01:34.828 --> 01:38.499
Guys, obviously he just
edited those clips together
to make you look bad.

01:38.532 --> 01:39.867
You're the one who's annoying!

01:39.900 --> 01:41.502
I'm not the one who's gross,
not me!

01:43.237 --> 01:45.273
Okay, okay, you're gonna
miss the best part.

01:45.306 --> 01:49.377
This election, vote for
a leader whose not afraid
to tell you the hard truth.

01:49.410 --> 01:50.711
Vote for Robin.

01:50.744 --> 01:53.414
This message was paid
for by the Teen Titans
and endorsed by Robin.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.882
The views expressed
may or may not be accurate.

01:54.915 --> 01:56.817
Any resemblances
to real persons
is purely coincidental.

01:59.320 --> 02:02.122
Oh, that was very
well made, Robin.

02:02.290 --> 02:03.524
What was all that about?

02:03.724 --> 02:05.693
The election for team leader
is coming up.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.895
And I'm ready to do whatever
it takes to win.

02:07.928 --> 02:10.898
But I'm not even
running against you.
No one is.

02:10.931 --> 02:14.502
Exactly. I crush my opponents
even before they start.

02:14.535 --> 02:16.904
How do you think
George Washington
became the first President?

02:16.937 --> 02:20.641
By inspiring a country
with is military leadership
and humility?

02:20.674 --> 02:22.243
That's lame.

02:22.276 --> 02:24.312
I would have been
a better President
than that doofus.

02:24.345 --> 02:26.547
Do we even vote
for team leader?

02:26.947 --> 02:28.482
Don't you remember last year?

02:34.822 --> 02:36.457
One vote for Robin.

02:36.490 --> 02:39.260
Oh, and no one else voted.

02:39.293 --> 02:43.531
That makes it official.
Robin is reelected
as team leader.

02:43.564 --> 02:45.666
Congratulations, Robin.

02:45.699 --> 02:47.401
(IMITATING CROWD WHOOPING

02:47.435 --> 02:49.403
Thank you, thank you.
It is an honor.

02:49.437 --> 02:51.672
You're going to do great,
you handsome little man.

02:55.976 --> 02:58.246
I'm expecting another
landslide victory.

02:58.579 --> 03:02.182
So, you losers better
not even think about
running against me.

03:04.352 --> 03:05.619
Can I count on your vote?

03:05.986 --> 03:07.355
Whoo! Whoo!

03:09.323 --> 03:10.324
Titans, go!

03:34.014 --> 03:37.217
Friends, look.
The television
is speaking of us.

03:37.485 --> 03:40.454
Breaking news.
The Teen Titans save
the day again

03:40.488 --> 03:42.490
and it's all caught on video.

03:42.790 --> 03:46.927
Oh, this must be
from my epic victory against
the H.I.V.E. yesterday.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.330
Your victory?
We were all there.

03:49.363 --> 03:51.031
Funny.
That's not how I remember it.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.901
Let's just watch
the video I provided
the local news station.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.608
Really, bro?
How could you?

04:00.641 --> 04:03.611
Yes, Robin, how could
you keep your four amazing

04:03.644 --> 04:06.314
quadruplet brothers a secret
for all of these years?

04:06.780 --> 04:09.850
I wish to meet the one
with the physique
similar to mine.

04:10.518 --> 04:13.354
No. How could you
take credit for our work?

04:13.387 --> 04:15.055
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

04:15.088 --> 04:18.959
But I think we can all agree
the video proves
I would make the best leader.

04:23.397 --> 04:25.032
He has finally gone too far.

04:25.065 --> 04:27.535
Someone needs to talk
some sense into him.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.303
And I know exactly who.

04:33.341 --> 04:34.442
Hey, what's up guys?

04:35.976 --> 04:39.380
Robin, we feel you have
lost the vision of what
is most important in a leader.

04:39.413 --> 04:42.416
So, I used a time machine
to bring one of history's
greatest leaders here

04:42.450 --> 04:44.352
to remind you what
leadership is all about.

04:47.755 --> 04:49.623
(MY COUNTRY 'TIS OF THEE

04:54.094 --> 04:57.598
It is a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.967
Whoa, George Washington?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.402
The one and only.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.404
Dude, who's that old lady?

05:03.437 --> 05:04.672
Show some respect.

05:04.705 --> 05:07.307
I think it's the grandma
who's on the back
of the dollar bill.

05:08.442 --> 05:10.077
Oh, Money Grandma.

05:10.110 --> 05:11.311
She's rad.

05:12.413 --> 05:15.483
Being a true leader, Robin,
is like being a gardener.

05:15.516 --> 05:18.752
You must tend to your friends
like you might
a small sapling.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.088
For only by working together
towards a common goal

05:21.121 --> 05:25.325
can a true team
with the strength
of a mighty oak be formed.

05:25.593 --> 05:27.027
I think I understand.

05:27.060 --> 05:29.863
You want to run
for team leader against me?

05:29.897 --> 05:32.366
-I will ruin you, Washington.

05:32.733 --> 05:35.102
Robin, you misunderstand.

05:35.135 --> 05:37.438
-He merely...
-Such insolence!

05:37.471 --> 05:39.773
Alright, you little Red Coat.
If you want to test my mettle,

05:39.807 --> 05:42.610
you shall find me ready
to deliver a quality
trashing indeed.

05:46.146 --> 05:47.448
Bring it on!

05:47.481 --> 05:49.383
-I will bring it on.

05:49.417 --> 05:50.618
-Take that, Georgie Porgie.
-Stop it.

05:50.651 --> 05:52.453
-Stop it. Stop it now.
-Oh, you're still
with the old school.

My brave friends,

07:17.971 --> 07:20.708
together we can form
a more perfect team.

A group brought together
by discipline
to stop evil in its tracks

07:25.513 --> 07:29.016
and truly earn the name Titan.

-Preach to us, Money Grandma!
-You've got this,
Money Grandma.

07:37.591 --> 07:41.829
It has been said
of my opponent
that he cannot tell a lie.

07:41.862 --> 07:44.765
Guilty as charged.

07:45.633 --> 07:46.867
Earlier today,

07:46.900 --> 07:48.869
did you not ask,
"do you smell that?"

07:48.902 --> 07:50.704
in regards
to a noxious odor?

07:50.738 --> 07:54.174
I recall that, yes.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.777
Yes, okay.
Then I ask you,
good sir,

07:56.810 --> 07:59.880
where you not in fact
responsible for that odor?

07:59.913 --> 08:03.050
I... Well, you see,
here's the thing.

08:03.283 --> 08:04.652
You are evading.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.253
No. No.
It's just that...

08:06.286 --> 08:09.523
Answer the question,
President Washington!

08:11.559 --> 08:12.593
Yes!

08:12.626 --> 08:15.128
Yes, it's true. I farted.

08:15.162 --> 08:18.165
I smelt it and it
was I who dealt it.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.068
I rest my case.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.744
One vote for Washington.
One vote for Robin.

08:30.778 --> 08:32.279
-It's a tie.

08:32.312 --> 08:33.246
You guys didn't vote?

08:33.280 --> 08:36.283
-No.
-Of course not.
I'm not into politics.

08:36.316 --> 08:38.018
Then how shall we
break the tie?

08:38.051 --> 08:40.821
There's only one way
to settle this, Washington.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.756
BOTH: Fisticuffs!

08:42.790 --> 08:45.893
And the winner
will lead the Titans.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.928
Robin, you can't fight
George Washington.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.797
Yeah, you leave
that sweet, old woman alone.

08:49.830 --> 08:50.898
Not a chance.

08:56.336 --> 09:00.307
I've cut down more
than cherry trees
with this ax, child.

Do you yield?

09:57.297 --> 09:59.299
I yield.

09:59.332 --> 10:00.333
Good lad.

10:01.001 --> 10:02.770
Are you the okay, Robin?

10:03.737 --> 10:05.372
I see now I was wrong.

10:05.405 --> 10:09.376
I wanted to win this election
so badly I forgot what being
a true leader really means.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.879
So, effective immediately,

10:12.179 --> 10:14.915
George Washington
is the leader
of the Teen Titans.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.349
ROBIN: Sorry, guys.

10:17.785 --> 10:21.288
I'm sorry you won't be
around to see me become
the greatest leader ever!

10:21.955 --> 10:24.124
Robin, what are you doing?

10:24.157 --> 10:27.194
You can read about it
in the history books.

Guys, look!

the British with his
sweet Kung Fu moves,

of the plan, Raven?
