00:56.200 --> 00:57.910
My name is Cole.

01:01.250 --> 01:03.990
And l was head of security
for N-gen lndustries.

01:07.660 --> 01:10.580
But it was a scientific company
that no one knew about.

01:13.700 --> 01:15.330
And for them l murdered

01:16.410 --> 01:18.410
and l tortured

01:19.410 --> 01:21.740
and l destroyed lives.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.240
And l helped them.

01:29.330 --> 01:31.370
l helped them create this new world

01:33.700 --> 01:35.950
where everything has changed.

01:39.580 --> 01:41.870
Everything has changed.

01:51.660 --> 01:53.120
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:53.250 --> 01:56.910
we live in a society
that becomes more demanding,

01:57.040 --> 02:00.160
fast-paced and hectic by the day.

02:00.290 --> 02:02.580
To cope with this,
we all need a little help,

02:02.700 --> 02:05.950
and as managing director
of N-gen lndustries,

02:06.080 --> 02:09.789
l'm proud to announce
the arrival of RAK 295,

02:09.910 --> 02:13.990
the next generation
of performance-boosting supplement.

02:15.580 --> 02:17.740
(Reporter) Mr White,
if RAK 295 has an effect

02:17.870 --> 02:21.580
on mental and physical abilities,
how can you be sure it'll be safe?

02:21.700 --> 02:25.040
(Mr White) We pride ourselves
on our thorough procedures at N-gen.

02:25.160 --> 02:27.870
A full RAK-295 testing programme
is underway

02:28.000 --> 02:31.120
with 30,000 volunteers participating.

02:31.620 --> 02:35.370
Following two months of assessment,
they will be recalled,

02:35.500 --> 02:39.120
fully tested, and the product
will then be available to all.

02:39.250 --> 02:41.660
(Reporter) Are you sure
two months is enough time?

02:41.790 --> 02:45.080
(Mr White) The work of lead scientist,
Michael Brooke, and my team

02:45.200 --> 02:47.040
prior to the testing phase

02:47.160 --> 02:50.240
will be there for all to see,
but l can assure you,

02:50.370 --> 02:55.450
l have no concerns whatsoever
regarding any harmful side effects.

02:55.580 --> 02:59.160
- Mr White, l have another question.
- No more questions.

03:11.540 --> 03:14.990
(Newsreader) 'The British
pharmaceutical giant, N-gen lndustries,

03:15.120 --> 03:17.410

to the two hospitals in Manchester.

04:18.120 --> 04:20.120
Two more upstairs.

04:21.329 --> 04:22.370
So that's all of them,

all with failing organs
and vascular collapse.

04:25.870 --> 04:28.790
29,999.

04:31.910 --> 04:35.240
And her, Angela Mills. Nothing yet?

04:35.370 --> 04:37.740
No sign of her?

04:37.870 --> 04:41.740
She's not in any hospital in the country.
l want to look at her flat now with Billing.

04:42.410 --> 04:45.830
She has a stepbrother in the river service.
Cooper's looking into that.

04:45.950 --> 04:49.160
- But what about her parents?
- Died three years ago.

04:49.290 --> 04:51.950
White thinks she might be dead.

04:52.080 --> 04:55.080
What if she's alive and unaffected?

04:55.200 --> 04:56.950
Either way we need to find her.

05:01.290 --> 05:03.740
Our glorious CEO
will be paying us a visit later.

05:04.910 --> 05:06.910
N-gen, it's finished.

05:08.200 --> 05:11.120
Even White's pockets
can't handle 30,000 lawsuits.

05:11.660 --> 05:13.950
We owe it to these people
to fix what we've done.

05:14.080 --> 05:17.120
We'll never be able
to fix what we've done, Michael.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.450
lt's already too late for that.

05:21.040 --> 05:24.700
Listen, look,
l'll be back before White arrives.

05:24.830 --> 05:26.370
Just hold it together, yeah?

05:27.660 --> 05:29.740
(Screaming)

05:39.620 --> 05:44.370
- The incident report was inconclusive.
- lt's meant to be proof.

Your shoulder injury from the struggle
is still our best hope.

05:47.660 --> 05:50.870

- We have a much harder battle ahead.

05:53.910 --> 05:57.040
See for yourself.
They've picked a side.

05:57.160 --> 05:59.160
l didn't do anything wrong, Morgan.

06:00.370 --> 06:01.830
l didn't.

06:01.950 --> 06:03.700
l'll see you in court next Tuesday.

06:21.160 --> 06:23.200
All out of limos.

06:29.830 --> 06:31.740
Great to see you.

06:44.160 --> 06:46.490
l'll give it all back to you, Steve.

06:46.620 --> 06:48.240
Every penny.

06:48.370 --> 06:50.540
l'm not bothered about that, mate.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.540
Let's just get you back on track, eh?

07:03.870 --> 07:06.120
Fuck it!

07:06.250 --> 07:07.700
Get over there.

- Never mind me. Who the fuck are you?

Check his numbers.

07:19.910 --> 07:21.990
- No!
- Now you listen to me.

07:22.120 --> 07:24.910
l'm going to ask you once and once only.

07:26.080 --> 07:28.160
Where is Angela Mills?

07:28.290 --> 07:30.120

07:30.250 --> 07:31.910

07:40.950 --> 07:43.160
There's nothing, no number.

07:50.040 --> 07:51.540
Where is she?

07:53.080 --> 07:55.740
We know she lived here,
so where did she go?

07:59.410 --> 07:59.990
(Slap)

08:00.120 --> 08:01.160
Aargh!

08:01.290 --> 08:04.540
Where's Angela Mills?
Where did she go?

08:04.660 --> 08:05.740
(Slap)

08:05.870 --> 08:08.910

He knows nothing.

Go and get the car.

and l'm already late.

OK? Joe will always let you down.
Always.

- That's what l'm doing.

Yeah, well,
Joe's a fucking disgrace, isn't he?

14:03.120 --> 14:06.990

He let the entire MSU down.

Anyway, listen up.
lt's kicking off all over the gaff.

to Battersea Bridge.

There's some kind of riot going on.
People are diving in the drink.

14:15.450 --> 14:17.540
So what we're going to do

14:17.660 --> 14:19.910
is steam down there
and pick up the jumpers.

14:20.040 --> 14:23.540
So dust her down, lock 'n' load.
Let's get ready to rock 'n' roll, boys.

- Something's wrong with Sally!
- There's always something wrong.

14:28.540 --> 14:32.450
No, she said some guy attacked her
on the way in today and she just fainted.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.620
l think it must be shock.

14:34.750 --> 14:36.410

14:36.540 --> 14:38.740
Oh, Jesus! Get ready!

14:38.870 --> 14:40.910
Come on, let's go.

14:54.950 --> 14:57.040
Jesus fucking Christ!

14:58.000 --> 15:01.240
This is John Healy, our first trialist.

15:02.290 --> 15:06.620
A week after receiving his initial dose,
he started having an allergic reaction.

15:06.750 --> 15:07.790
A bad one.

15:08.790 --> 15:11.580
We thought it best
to keep him in isolation.

15:11.700 --> 15:15.580
His physiology and cellular make-up
started changing two days later.

15:17.330 --> 15:21.040
The viral suppressants we've been
administering seemed to keep it at bay.

15:21.950 --> 15:25.540
Although it hasn't completely stopped
the abnormal changes.

15:26.500 --> 15:29.040
We've taken everybody off it
to see what would happen.

15:29.160 --> 15:30.200
And?

15:31.500 --> 15:33.910
Nothing.
He's just been lying there.

15:34.040 --> 15:36.660
Billing, that doctor.
Talk to me. What's going on?

15:36.790 --> 15:40.120
What in God's name
are these things on his back?

15:40.250 --> 15:43.660
- He's not contagious, is he?
- We're not sure.

15:43.790 --> 15:45.080
(Grunts)

15:45.200 --> 15:47.620
Billing, get back here.
We've got a problem.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.200
Billing, come in.

15:51.120 --> 15:53.660
(Brooke) Get an adrenaline shot. Hurry!

15:56.790 --> 15:59.200
(Sparking)

16:01.000 --> 16:03.240

16:03.370 --> 16:06.910
- (Cole) Everybody just stay still.
- (White) What's that noise?

16:08.410 --> 16:09.450
(Trialist growls)

16:11.870 --> 16:13.240
(Brooke) Lockdown.

16:13.370 --> 16:14.740
Why are we in lockdown, Cole?

(White) What the fuck was that?
What have you done, Brooke?

17:23.079 --> 17:24.700
What the fuck have you done?

17:25.790 --> 17:27.200
Brooke?

17:29.500 --> 17:30.370

17:30.500 --> 17:32.620

Oi, oi!
Stay still. Stay still, will you?

18:14.250 --> 18:17.160
Stay still.
Come on, hold the crazy bastard.

18:17.290 --> 18:18.950
Come on, hold him!

18:19.080 --> 18:20.740
Keep fucking still, will you?

18:22.830 --> 18:25.290
Aaargh! He fucking bit me!

18:28.580 --> 18:32.040
Come on, we should go back inside.
lt's not safe out here.

18:48.120 --> 18:52.540
- Where's all your cars?
- l had to get the cash from somewhere.

18:52.660 --> 18:56.490
- Fucking hell. Sorry, mate.
- Enough of that bollocks, eh?

18:56.620 --> 18:58.790
lt's not important.
lt's only a bit of cash.

19:04.620 --> 19:09.080
Hey, l don't think she knew
you were getting out, you know.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.950
l haven't seen her since l went in.

19:12.080 --> 19:14.410
No letters, no phone calls, nothing.

19:15.950 --> 19:19.580
l know l let her down.
l need to see her.

19:19.700 --> 19:23.120
- She needs to know l didn't do it.
- l wish l could help you, mate.

19:23.250 --> 19:25.540
But l haven't seen her
since it all happened.

19:27.330 --> 19:28.990
Come on, eh?

19:36.700 --> 19:40.450
l get 24 more hours in the air,
then l take my test.

19:40.580 --> 19:43.870
l can't wait to get off this fucking river.
lt's hardly a river, is it?

19:44.000 --> 19:47.450
More like a plague-ridden cesspit
of Ebola or something.

19:47.580 --> 19:50.040
Ebola, no. Plague, maybe.

19:50.160 --> 19:52.740
- Bubonic or pneumonic?
- What's the difference?

19:52.870 --> 19:54.540
(Explosion)

19:54.660 --> 19:57.080
What the fuck was that?

19:57.200 --> 19:59.370
192 to Central, come in.

19:59.500 --> 20:01.080
192 to Central, come in!

20:01.200 --> 20:04.160
- Get the boat ready.
- Fucking hell!

20:05.580 --> 20:08.490
Sarge, Sarge!
Sarge, what are you doing?

20:09.700 --> 20:10.740
Sarge!

20:12.120 --> 20:13.910
Sarge, what are you doing? Guv!

20:14.040 --> 20:15.450
Guv!

20:43.080 --> 20:46.040
This is MSU Central.
We need help.

20:46.160 --> 20:47.870
Someone, come in.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.830
Matt, what the fuck is going on?

20:50.950 --> 20:52.040
(Screaming)

20:52.160 --> 20:54.080
This is seriously fucked up.

20:54.200 --> 20:57.490
This is MSU Central, come in.
We need help. Somebody, anybody.

20:57.620 --> 20:59.580

21:07.330 --> 21:09.240
Jim, what the hell's going on?

21:17.540 --> 21:18.700
(Brooke) Cole?

21:19.830 --> 21:21.830
Cole? Cole, wake up!

21:23.700 --> 21:25.660
Cole!

21:25.790 --> 21:27.450
Cole, wake up!

21:29.250 --> 21:31.950
For God's sake, wake up!

21:55.200 --> 21:57.370
Get up, get up.

21:57.500 --> 21:58.950
Over here.

22:03.870 --> 22:07.040
Something must have gone wrong
with the code.

22:07.160 --> 22:10.240
What we saw is impossible.
This is just impossible.

22:10.370 --> 22:12.450
(Roaring)

22:14.910 --> 22:17.740
lt got in behind him
as he was trying to shut the door.

22:18.910 --> 22:21.910
Well, the power's back on,
so why hasn't help arrived?

22:22.040 --> 22:24.040
l hate to think.

22:24.160 --> 22:25.950
Well, now we know it spreads.

22:26.080 --> 22:28.330
But how? Blood, maybe.

22:29.200 --> 22:32.450
Maybe saliva. l don't know.

22:32.580 --> 22:35.580
- l just don't know any more.
- So that means they've all got it.

22:36.200 --> 22:38.830
All of those upstairs

22:38.950 --> 22:41.450
and all of those in the hospitals.

22:41.580 --> 22:46.200
They're all going to catch it and
then it's going to spread even further.

22:48.580 --> 22:49.620
And now l've got it.

22:52.830 --> 22:56.990
ls there anything l can take?
The stuff you used on the other patients.

22:57.120 --> 23:00.450
The viral suppressant. lt's in there.

23:00.580 --> 23:01.830
The syrettes.

23:03.950 --> 23:07.990
There's only three but that should
control the infection for up to 18 hours.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.200
Well, we've got to figure something out.

23:15.450 --> 23:17.990
- Aaargh!
- No, no, no!

23:18.120 --> 23:20.660
- No, no!
- Oh, shit.

23:20.790 --> 23:24.660
- l thought he was a...
- Please hang on.

23:24.790 --> 23:27.830
Cole, l didn't realise.
This place is a fucking slaughterhouse.

23:27.950 --> 23:31.870
They're all dead,
and if they're not dead, they're turning.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.040
Angela...

23:33.160 --> 23:36.160
Talk to me.
Talk to me, Michael.

23:36.290 --> 23:38.450
Find Angela Mills.

23:40.830 --> 23:42.910

23:43.040 --> 23:46.660

- Shut up!

23:48.410 --> 23:49.870

23:56.750 --> 23:58.120
Don't.

About 40 minutes.

- Dead.

29:26.580 --> 29:30.120
That's why Mummy took you out there
with what's-his-name, isn't it?

29:30.250 --> 29:33.490
So you could enjoy Spain,
the good weather, the food.

29:33.620 --> 29:35.910
Just be a good boy for her, OK?
All right.

29:36.040 --> 29:38.660
Yes, you'll be with Daddy
in about a week, OK?

29:38.790 --> 29:41.790
All right.
l love you too, son. l miss you loads.

- Yeah.

with the trial coming up. lt's proof.

She'll be all right.

What chance have we got of finding her?

31:18.200 --> 31:22.040
She's a smart girl. She's probably
in a safer place than we are right now.

OK?

31:24.120 --> 31:28.160

Yeah.

Steve.

38:03.290 --> 38:05.990
Listen, the car's completely broken down.

38:06.120 --> 38:08.950
We need your help to fix it.

38:23.200 --> 38:24.660
(Steve) The radiator's gone.

38:24.790 --> 38:26.620
You won't get far like that.

38:26.750 --> 38:29.370
- Can't you lend us something?
- l haven't got anything.

38:29.500 --> 38:31.540
We had to sell the lot.
Needed the cash.

38:32.620 --> 38:35.790
You two should stay here.
We'll be all right.

38:35.910 --> 38:39.450
No, Joe, we need to get
to the Abraxon site across from MSU.

38:39.580 --> 38:42.620
Matt's meeting us there with Jim.
Jim's learning to be a pilot.

38:42.750 --> 38:44.910
He says they've got a helicopter.

38:45.700 --> 38:48.080
So what are you doing here?
Wapping's the other way.

38:48.200 --> 38:51.120
- We figured we'd go round the traffic.
- Who's Jim?

38:53.080 --> 38:56.160
- Jim's got your old job.
- Kate!

38:56.290 --> 38:57.330
Fuck 'em.

38:57.450 --> 39:00.240
As far as they're concerned,
l'm fucking guilty.

39:00.370 --> 39:03.370
Did you think they were going
to give you your job back?

39:03.500 --> 39:05.040
No, we're safe here.

39:05.950 --> 39:08.080
- Joe...
- The news says to stay indoors.

39:08.200 --> 39:09.740
ln all fairness, it did say that.

39:09.870 --> 39:12.450
You'd be stupid to go into town.
lt's carnage out there.

39:12.580 --> 39:14.450
The news said it was pretty fucking bad.

39:14.580 --> 39:16.080
Well, this is hardly Fort Knox!

39:17.830 --> 39:20.700
How do we know
Matt and Jim will even be there?

39:20.830 --> 39:22.620
Unlike you, Joe, we can trust them.

39:22.750 --> 39:24.120
- What?
- You know what.

39:24.250 --> 39:25.990
Just hang on for a minute.

39:28.330 --> 39:29.910
(Rattling)

39:30.040 --> 39:31.830
- (Kate) Ange!
- Get the gun!

39:32.870 --> 39:34.160
(Kate) What the fuck is it?

39:34.290 --> 39:36.580
No, no, no!

39:38.410 --> 39:40.740
(Rattling)

39:46.290 --> 39:48.790
(Man) Don't shoot!
(Woman) Get away from the door!

39:50.700 --> 39:53.790
- (American accent) Easy, easy!
- Now just calm down, all right?

39:53.910 --> 39:57.040
Just calm down.

40:06.700 --> 40:08.620
(Kate) What the fuck is that?

40:08.750 --> 40:11.540
(Girls wail)

40:47.120 --> 40:50.410
There you go, mate.
Do you want one, love?

40:50.540 --> 40:52.240
-No, thanks.
- Fair enough.

40:52.370 --> 40:56.290
So glad just to see
some normal faces, you know.

40:56.410 --> 40:58.330
What's going on?
What happened?

40:58.450 --> 41:01.740
Er, well,
we were on our way to work

41:01.870 --> 41:03.490
Near Bank.

41:03.620 --> 41:06.990
My colleague, Alex Johnson,
that's the guy who tried to...

41:07.120 --> 41:08.580
That was him.

41:09.580 --> 41:11.450
He was travelling with us

41:11.580 --> 41:14.330
when the subway stopped
and all the lights went out.

41:14.450 --> 41:17.120
The emergency lights came on.
The screaming had started.

41:17.950 --> 41:22.410
(Man) They came through the carriages,
clambering over each other like insects.

41:22.540 --> 41:26.450
They bite you. lt's like, they bite you
and then you become one of them.

41:26.580 --> 41:31.450
So we ran through the tunnels
till we got back to the station.

41:31.580 --> 41:34.660
- The police couldn't do much.
- No, they did nothing.

41:35.450 --> 41:38.410
One cop, l mean, he had a shotgun.

41:38.540 --> 41:40.660
He'd been bitten three or four times.

41:40.790 --> 41:44.870
So he turned...
He turned the gun around.

41:46.700 --> 41:49.990
- His head split open like a log.
- (Joe) Fucking Jesus!

41:50.120 --> 41:52.330
Well, that settles it.

41:52.450 --> 41:55.410
We barricade these fucking doors
and we stay here.

41:55.540 --> 41:58.330
No, wait a second.
You haven't understood.

41:58.450 --> 42:01.160
These things chase people.
That's all they care about.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.870
Everybody's running away from the city.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.290
Running this way.

42:08.410 --> 42:11.950
(Kate) Do you hear that?
There can't be any questions now.

42:12.080 --> 42:15.240
We go to the Abraxon site, yeah?

42:15.370 --> 42:17.740
- What's there?
- (Steve) There's a helicopter.

42:17.870 --> 42:20.910
- (Man) Sounds like a plan.
- (Joe) Why don't we head for the coast?

42:21.040 --> 42:22.490
There's too many of us.

42:23.580 --> 42:26.740
There's not enough room.
Matt said it was a four-seater helicopter.

42:26.870 --> 42:29.330
(Joe) Four people.
lt's a fucking joke!

42:30.410 --> 42:33.200
No, we'll make it work.
We'll make it work somehow.

43:01.160 --> 43:03.200
Oh, my God.
There's someone outside.

43:04.540 --> 43:05.580
Joe!

43:16.160 --> 43:18.370
Aaaargh!

43:39.200 --> 43:40.490
(Screeching)

43:48.290 --> 43:49.330
(Snarling)

43:57.660 --> 44:00.540
ls he one of them?

44:00.660 --> 44:02.830
You all right, mate?

44:06.700 --> 44:07.540
(Breaking glass)

44:07.660 --> 44:10.330
Shit, they're coming
through the office window!

44:10.450 --> 44:11.490
Fuck it!

44:16.330 --> 44:17.790
Get over there!

44:26.790 --> 44:27.910
Take this.

44:28.040 --> 44:29.200
(Roaring)

44:33.500 --> 44:35.910
(Snarling)

44:37.080 --> 44:41.200
On three, you go over the top
and you go behind me, OK?

44:45.410 --> 44:46.450
One...

44:48.040 --> 44:48.870
two...

44:50.290 --> 44:51.540
three!

45:15.910 --> 45:16.950
(Girls scream)

45:23.410 --> 45:25.370
(Sobbing)

46:03.160 --> 46:04.700
Matt, wait.

46:04.830 --> 46:06.830
Sandra, what...?

46:06.950 --> 46:08.580
Sandra?

46:08.700 --> 46:11.450
- (Choking)
- (Jim) Oh, Jesus! Sandra?

46:17.540 --> 46:18.660
(Sandra) Run!

46:20.370 --> 46:21.950
No, Andy!

46:22.080 --> 46:23.540
Fuck!

46:23.660 --> 46:25.540
Fucking hell, run!

46:25.660 --> 46:27.160
Run! Run!

46:27.660 --> 46:28.700
(Snarling)

46:30.870 --> 46:33.240
(Jim screams)

47:02.750 --> 47:05.240
Jim, look.
They're scared of the water.

47:07.120 --> 47:10.200
We might make it, Jim.
We might just fucking make it.

47:12.750 --> 47:15.910
Jesus Christ, are you OK?

47:17.160 --> 47:18.870
Keep it raised.

47:19.000 --> 47:22.830
- Let's just get out of here. l'll be fine.
- Try and stop the blood flow.

47:32.290 --> 47:34.790
(Wailing)

47:40.330 --> 47:41.740
Ow!

47:45.250 --> 47:47.790
That's all we can do.
We were quick. You might be lucky.

47:49.370 --> 47:52.450
- What about me?
- What about you?

47:54.950 --> 47:56.410
l'm still here, ain't l?

47:58.750 --> 48:00.200
All right, listen, everyone.

48:01.290 --> 48:05.120
You've seen what two of them can do.
They move fast and they spread fast.

48:05.250 --> 48:07.120
We need to do exactly the same thing.

48:07.620 --> 48:10.490
Now, as this is a garage,
l'm hoping there's a car we can use.

48:10.620 --> 48:12.290
Who are you?

48:13.500 --> 48:15.290
(Joe) She asked you a question.

48:16.700 --> 48:19.200
- l'm Cole.
- (Angela) What are you doing?

48:19.330 --> 48:21.490
l'm running, just like everyone else.

48:21.620 --> 48:24.200
We're all in the same boat
so we need to help each other.

48:24.330 --> 48:26.990
What happened back there?
Looked like a heart attack.

48:27.120 --> 48:28.910
What are you, a fucking doctor?

48:31.450 --> 48:33.740
l'm a diabetic.

48:33.870 --> 48:36.620
There's a van outside.
l need to change the fuel pump.

48:36.750 --> 48:38.700
l think l can use
the one from Angie's car.

48:38.830 --> 48:40.830
l'll try and make a start on it, all right?

48:45.160 --> 48:47.370
There's a helicopter
at a site in Wapping.

48:47.500 --> 48:51.160
Yeah, but that's that way, isn't it?
Back in the shit.

48:51.290 --> 48:52.990
Don't see your helicopter outside.

48:55.620 --> 48:58.660
- OK, so what type is it?
- l don't know. lt's a four-seater.

48:58.790 --> 49:02.370
Well, the only way round that
is to do multiple trips.

49:02.500 --> 49:04.790
l'm good with cars
but not with helicopters.

49:04.910 --> 49:06.540
(Angela) We have a pilot.

49:07.660 --> 49:09.290
And who would that be?

49:09.410 --> 49:11.580
He's a friend of ours.
He's meeting us there.

49:12.410 --> 49:14.410
l need a map. Show me.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.330
And now there's even more of us.

49:27.370 --> 49:31.200
(Cole) Steve, you've got to be quick.
There's not a lot of time.

49:33.790 --> 49:36.660
Have you got any soya milk?

49:36.790 --> 49:39.080
Yeah, it'll be in the fridge
next to the caviar.

49:43.040 --> 49:45.700
The man in the suit,
is that the policeman that...?

49:45.830 --> 49:49.700
- Yeah, that's the same prick.
- Hey, Katie, watch your mouth, eh?

49:49.830 --> 49:53.040
- He's still a good mate of mine.
- l'm sorry, l'm just...

49:53.160 --> 49:55.200
l'm not coping well with this, you know?

49:55.330 --> 49:58.910
Yeah, well, the way l see it,
everybody deserves a second chance.

50:07.660 --> 50:09.330
lt is him.

50:11.120 --> 50:12.950
Yeah, l thought so.

50:13.580 --> 50:15.950
He was meant
to go on trial sometime soon.

50:17.040 --> 50:18.990
Shot a kid who stole a boat.

50:21.080 --> 50:24.450
Back home a cock-sucker gets the chair,
no questions asked.

50:26.120 --> 50:28.870
There's something
that's bothering me more than that.

50:29.000 --> 50:32.330
- What's that?
- Friends and family.

50:32.450 --> 50:35.040
Most important thing in the world.

50:35.160 --> 50:36.700
And we're neither.

50:38.910 --> 50:40.660
We're the outsiders here.

50:43.250 --> 50:47.830
OK, the helicopter holds four people.
So we do three separate trips as agreed.

50:49.950 --> 50:51.870
l'll go last.

50:53.370 --> 50:56.740
- You all right, mate?
- l didn't agree to it.

50:56.870 --> 50:59.490
- lt's a fucked-up plan.
- Why?

50:59.620 --> 51:03.660
What if the pilot don't want to come back
or the chopper runs out of juice?

51:03.790 --> 51:05.700
What do the second and third parties do?

51:05.830 --> 51:09.040
Just wait around and be attacked?
Forget the helicopter.

51:09.160 --> 51:10.580
We drive.

51:10.700 --> 51:13.200
We go to Dover, Folkestone, wherever.
We grab a boat.

51:13.330 --> 51:15.790
Are you mad?
You'd last ten minutes at the most.

51:15.910 --> 51:19.450
l've just spent two months in prison.
l think l can handle a road.

51:19.580 --> 51:22.040
Yeah, well, once we get the helicopter,

51:22.160 --> 51:24.790
you're more than welcome
to the van and the road.

51:25.580 --> 51:28.580
Me and Angela will drop you at
the Abraxon place and then go our...

51:28.700 --> 51:32.080
You go on your own.
She comes with us.

51:32.200 --> 51:35.450
Are you fucking serious?
What, you think l'm some sort of...?

51:35.580 --> 51:37.040
Jesus, enough!

51:39.330 --> 51:41.540
She stays with me.

51:41.660 --> 51:43.290
Do you understand?

51:51.450 --> 51:54.330
How long with that fuel pump?
We've got to get that van going.

51:55.000 --> 51:56.580
(Groaning)

52:06.200 --> 52:08.910
How's your arm, Jim?
ls it getting worse?

52:09.830 --> 52:11.370
Look, whatever "it" is,

52:11.500 --> 52:13.620
Andy's infected me with it.

52:13.750 --> 52:14.830
Fucking arsehole!

52:17.620 --> 52:19.370
lf we don't make it to the helipad,

52:19.500 --> 52:21.120
just fucking throw me overboard.

52:21.250 --> 52:22.370
l'm not doing that, Jim.

52:22.500 --> 52:26.660
You can't let me
become one of those things.

52:26.790 --> 52:28.240
l can't do that, Jim.

52:34.540 --> 52:35.990
OK.

52:37.370 --> 52:38.870
Promise me.

52:40.660 --> 52:41.700
l promise.

53:16.700 --> 53:19.160
Why are you showing me this?

53:21.950 --> 53:24.120
- You know why.
- l'm fine.

53:24.700 --> 53:26.830
l'm absolutely fine.

53:26.950 --> 53:28.790
That's why l'm here.

53:28.910 --> 53:30.620
Because of the testing.

53:30.750 --> 53:34.540
Everyone who took RAK
has turned into one of those things.

53:34.660 --> 53:37.080
l saw one change
right in front of my own eyes.

53:38.330 --> 53:43.080
- Are you saying that l'm next?
- No, l don't think you will be.

53:44.370 --> 53:48.040
30,000 people turned
and are spreading it.

53:48.160 --> 53:51.620
For some reason,
you're different from all the other trialists.

53:51.750 --> 53:54.120
You're special somehow.

53:54.250 --> 53:57.620
We've got to get you
out the country and into a lab.

53:57.750 --> 53:59.620
And we've got to do some tests.

54:00.450 --> 54:04.290
You might be the person to stop all this,
but first things first.

54:04.410 --> 54:06.290
You listen to me.

54:16.040 --> 54:18.290
Just leave me alone, Joe.

54:25.200 --> 54:27.700
That shit on TV.

54:29.080 --> 54:31.450
lt's the reason behind all this.

54:32.200 --> 54:35.240
People having heart problems.

54:35.370 --> 54:37.740
They're the symptoms,

54:37.870 --> 54:39.490
the start of it.

54:42.790 --> 54:45.160
l was one of the first trialists.

54:48.950 --> 54:50.830
- So are you...?
- No.

54:52.040 --> 54:54.200
l haven't got any symptoms.

54:55.370 --> 54:57.580
l'm the only one who hasn't.

55:00.450 --> 55:03.620
- Why did you do it?
- Why do you think, Joe?

55:04.620 --> 55:07.620
l was trying to rebuild my life.

55:07.750 --> 55:09.950
l needed the money.

55:10.080 --> 55:12.200
Who told you about the drug?

55:13.000 --> 55:14.790
Cole?

55:17.330 --> 55:20.830
He's lying.
Doesn't make sense.

55:20.950 --> 55:23.910
- Why is it spreading?
- l don't want to talk about it any more.

55:24.040 --> 55:25.870
l don't want to talk about it, Joe.

55:39.450 --> 55:41.580
ln all the time we were together,

55:43.790 --> 55:46.080
l never lied to you once, Ange.

55:48.450 --> 55:50.580
l just want you to know that.

55:54.500 --> 55:56.160
l'm pregnant, Joe.

55:57.750 --> 55:59.330
What?

56:43.160 --> 56:45.490
Well, do you want to keep it?

56:47.080 --> 56:49.870
Yeah. l think l do.

57:04.580 --> 57:06.040
l'll be there for you.

57:07.950 --> 57:11.080
You know that, don't you?
No matter what.

57:11.910 --> 57:14.740
All the more reason
to get you out of here in one piece, eh?

57:25.120 --> 57:26.540
Steve's nearly done.

57:26.660 --> 57:27.870
We need to move. Now.

57:29.370 --> 57:30.830
For fuck's sake.

57:30.950 --> 57:33.330
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

57:33.450 --> 57:36.160
- Just practising.
- Practising what?

57:36.290 --> 57:37.910
Give me the weapon.

57:38.040 --> 57:40.160
- Stand up.
- Why?

57:40.290 --> 57:43.290
- Stand up!
- Hey, come on.

57:43.410 --> 57:45.580
Let me tell you something.

57:45.700 --> 57:49.040
Right here, right now,
you do exactly as l say.

57:49.160 --> 57:52.410
And don't fucking question me again.
You got that?

57:55.410 --> 57:58.450
- Show me your hand.
- (Woman) You be careful!

58:04.580 --> 58:06.240
Am l going to be OK?

58:08.200 --> 58:09.240
Probably.

58:10.120 --> 58:13.740
- What do you mean, "probably"?
- You ready?

58:13.870 --> 58:15.990
- l'm coming as well.
- Whatever.

58:17.450 --> 58:18.490
Geoff.

58:19.660 --> 58:21.990
He's going to leave us behind.

58:22.120 --> 58:25.790
That's exactly what's going to happen.
He doesn't like us.

58:25.910 --> 58:29.040
lf there are too many of us
and not enough room on that helicopter,

58:29.160 --> 58:31.700
- we're the ones he'll leave.
- Yeah, but Lavinia...

58:31.830 --> 58:35.660
- Geoffrey.
- We won't let that happen.

58:38.330 --> 58:40.080
Right?

59:04.700 --> 59:06.790
(Joe) There's something
l want you to know.

59:07.330 --> 59:08.790
Yeah?

59:08.910 --> 59:11.290
She's pregnant and it's mine.

59:12.250 --> 59:15.490
So whether she's immune or not,
she's coming with me.

59:15.620 --> 59:19.290
There's no way l'm letting them
become someone's chemistry project.

59:21.330 --> 59:23.410
So you'd better stay
out of my fucking way.

59:27.750 --> 59:29.990
You know, there was a time

59:30.120 --> 59:34.040
when right now you'd be screaming
and begging for mercy.

59:42.870 --> 59:44.740
The RAK testing, Katie.

59:44.870 --> 59:48.200
lt's responsible for all of this.

59:48.330 --> 59:51.540
- You don't know that.
- l do know that.

59:51.660 --> 59:52.700
Cole told me.

59:52.830 --> 59:56.540
He works at N-gen.
He saw a guy who took it there turn.

59:57.580 --> 59:58.990
What?

59:59.120 --> 01:00:01.200
God, l don't know. l don't know.

01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:03.290
l'm so scared.

01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:05.580
Oh, my God.

01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:08.580
You could turn into one of those things.

01:00:09.790 --> 01:00:11.700
What?

01:00:11.830 --> 01:00:13.580
No, l won't.

01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:16.540
l'm fine. l'm fine right now.

01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:18.620
Yeah, sorry.

01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:20.740
l'm shocked, that's all.

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:25.290
You've said all along
you feel fine, right?

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.450
Right?

01:00:33.450 --> 01:00:35.660
Fuck!

01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:47.040
(Sighs)

01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:49.950
Hey.

01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:56.490
You know, in the States RAK 295

01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:59.910
was apparently going
to be marketed as Quentinium.

01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:02.740
So?

01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:05.120
Lucky nobody in here takes it, that's all.

01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:07.490
lmagine if they did. My God!

01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:08.660
She's fine.

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:11.160
You're the one with the bitten finger,
remember?

01:01:11.290 --> 01:01:14.370
Come on, Kate.
Do l look dangerous to you?

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.410
lf that crap had got into my bloodstream,

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:18.200
do you think l'd be sitting here?

01:01:18.330 --> 01:01:20.910
Yeah, well, Ange is not exactly
biting people, is she?

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:23.540
Yeah, but l'm not the one
who's been injected with RAK.

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:29.660
- She could be immune.
- Well, are you willing to take that risk?

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:33.080
l can't help but wonder
what would happen

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:36.660
if we're halfway across the Channel
in that chopper with nowhere to go

01:01:36.790 --> 01:01:39.700
and she turns into one of those things.

01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:41.330
What then?

01:01:42.830 --> 01:01:45.200
l know it's not an easy thing
to imagine, Kate,

01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:48.330
your friend becoming
like one of those things.

01:01:48.450 --> 01:01:50.660
But the same thing happened
to my colleague

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:52.330
and it's no longer them.

01:01:53.330 --> 01:01:55.200
They're as good as dead.

01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:58.540
Actually, they're worse.

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:04.040
What? Tell me. What?

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:05.620
You know what?

01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:07.490
l want you to get out of the car.

01:02:08.330 --> 01:02:11.290
- Get out of the car!
- Hey, it's just an opinion, all right?

01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:19.120
Lavie,

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:23.660
the blonde,

01:02:23.790 --> 01:02:28.410
she's infected with the same shit
that turns you into one of those things.

01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:30.410
That's all we need.

01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:41.410
Sorted.

01:02:45.330 --> 01:02:47.290
(Car won't start)

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:53.950
What is it?

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:02.580
We have to move, now.
Everybody get moving!

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:08.450
- Joe?
- Get the flashlights from the office.

01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:11.870
OK, now's our chance. Lock her in!

01:03:15.830 --> 01:03:17.660
- Lavie!
- Close the fucking door!

01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:25.540
Katie?

01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:26.700
Katie!

01:03:26.830 --> 01:03:29.450
All right, let's go.
Let's move! Get out of here!

01:03:30.250 --> 01:03:31.990
- The van won't start, mate.
- Angela?

01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:41.910
(Growling)

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:45.990
(Steve) Wait, l can't get the van started.
lnto the woods, move!

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:47.790
Move! Move it!

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.240
(Growls)

01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:16.790
(Snarls)

01:04:19.870 --> 01:04:21.080
(Tyres screech)

01:05:02.290 --> 01:05:04.660
- What happened?
- l don't know.

01:05:04.790 --> 01:05:07.910
A shelf fell across the door.
l was trapped. We have to find them.

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:10.450
- Baby, they could be anywhere.
- What? No...

01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:13.240
We need to think about other things.
Let's get to the coast.

01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:16.200
No, please, we have to.

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:21.200
l think there's one place we can try.

01:05:32.290 --> 01:05:33.830
Abraxon, Jim.

01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:35.700
We made it. We're here.

01:05:35.830 --> 01:05:37.290
Grab it, grab it!

01:05:37.410 --> 01:05:39.540
(Jim groans)

01:05:48.790 --> 01:05:50.200
Jim.

01:05:50.330 --> 01:05:52.490
Jim, OK.

01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:55.790
l'm going to go and have a look
and then l'll come back for you.

01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:58.290
- OK?
- Yes. Just hurry up, will you?

01:05:58.910 --> 01:06:00.740
Or l won't be able to fly anything.

01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:08.490
And Matt...

01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:14.120
Remember what l said, yeah? Before.

01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:35.990
Angie?

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:30.200
Aaaargh!

01:08:26.250 --> 01:08:30.290
(Geoff) Are you kidding? A fishing hut!
(Steve) You got any better ideas?

01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:32.080
No, l didn't think so.

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:35.910
Joe knows where this place is.
So this is where he'll come, all right?

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.950
- Are you sure he'll come?
- Joe's a mate.

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.040
We still don't know where Ange is.

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:42.950
Let's get inside here and wait for Joe.
He knows where we are.

01:08:58.250 --> 01:08:59.740
Aaargh!

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:03.120
Katie!

01:09:03.250 --> 01:09:05.240
(Snarling)

01:09:35.450 --> 01:09:38.830
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

01:09:38.950 --> 01:09:41.910
Oh, my God, Steve, l'm so sorry.

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:43.410
l'm so sorry!

01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:47.080
Let us in, you fucking bastards!
Let us in!

01:09:49.290 --> 01:09:50.540
Ange.

01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:52.490
You can't do what Cole says.

01:09:53.410 --> 01:09:55.200
He'll take you to some fucked-up lab.

01:09:56.910 --> 01:09:58.990
They'll do
all sorts of experiments on you.

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:01.950
They may even force you
to lose the baby.

01:10:05.290 --> 01:10:08.700
Joe, what really happened
on the boat with that kid?

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:23.580
l replay that moment in my mind
every single day.

01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:27.830
Sometimes...

01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:31.950
l manage to talk sense into him,
you know?

01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:36.700
l manage to get the gun off him,

01:10:38.370 --> 01:10:40.870
and then l'm the hero.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.740
The hero who saved a young man
high on crack from shooting someone.

01:10:46.290 --> 01:10:48.790
And not the cop
who killed a 14-year-old kid.

01:10:53.790 --> 01:10:56.830
lt doesn't matter now. He's dead.

01:10:58.910 --> 01:11:01.620
And whether he deserved it or not,
l helped him on his way.

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:07.410
That's something l'll have to live with
for the rest of my life.

01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:10.910
l'm not going to let you down again.

01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:26.370
Open the fucking door!

01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:30.490
Fuck. Fuck!

01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:34.410
We're nearly there.

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:37.200
Once she's gone,
there's only four of us.

01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:39.830
l can't do this.

01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:41.160
What are you doing?

01:11:41.290 --> 01:11:43.830
Hey, you listen to me!
We have to open the door.

01:11:43.950 --> 01:11:46.240
She will attract more of those things.

01:11:46.370 --> 01:11:47.870
ls that what you want?

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.540
Huh?

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:53.790
- Kate, l'm sorry...
- How could you?

01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:56.290
- What was l meant to do?
- What is the matter with you?

01:11:56.410 --> 01:11:57.910
Leave him alone!

01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:02.450
You fucking bitch!

01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:04.410
Angie!

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.830
Those fuckers locked us out.

01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:10.200
(Geoff) Hey, we were attacked.

01:12:11.410 --> 01:12:13.290
(Cole) You know what'll happen to him.

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:15.620
Fuck off!

01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:18.160
She's staying with me.

01:12:18.290 --> 01:12:21.490
She don't want to go with you.
l'm not going to tell you again.

01:12:22.450 --> 01:12:24.660
You really think it's that easy?

01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:26.990
Don't fucking tell me...

01:12:28.250 --> 01:12:30.450
- l can if l have to.
- No, you can't.

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:35.240
Because l can tell
you ain't got it in you, Joe.

01:12:35.370 --> 01:12:36.870
l can see it in your eyes.

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:41.910
Because l've killed more people
than l care to remember

01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:47.540
and l do not want to see you
ever, ever end up like me.

01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:57.160
Listen to me.

01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:01.870
Take that to him.

01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:08.040
Do it.

01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:26.740
(Kate) Oh, fuck!

01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:30.990
Joe.

01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:35.660
l don't want my little boy to know

01:13:39.410 --> 01:13:41.490
l knew you'd come back, mate.

01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:09.160
(Gunshot)

01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:17.830
You.

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:22.080
What did l say to you?
What did l say to you?

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:24.870
- He hasn't done anything.
- Shut your fucking mouth!

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.700
- Stay away.
- You two are staying here.

01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:32.160
How's your back, Angela?

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.080
Huh?

01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:35.660
How's that chest pain?

01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:40.290
She took RAK. She's going to turn
into one of those fucking things.

01:14:40.410 --> 01:14:43.620
Get on your fucking knees!
You left her in there, didn't you?

01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:47.160
- You left her in there. Answer me.
- He didn't do anything!

01:14:47.290 --> 01:14:51.330
- She did!
- What? That's not true.

01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:54.200
That's a lie.

01:14:54.330 --> 01:14:56.040
l didn't do anything.

01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:57.950
That's a fucking lie!

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.290
Don't, Cole. lt isn't right.

01:15:01.410 --> 01:15:05.740
She knows you're going to turn
into one of them. She doesn't trust you.

01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:06.990
None of us do.

01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:09.870
(Kate) Please, l didn't do anything.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.240
l promise you, l didn't do anything!

01:15:12.370 --> 01:15:14.450
Please believe me.

01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:19.330
That's just it, though, isn't it?

01:15:20.250 --> 01:15:21.700
You just left me there.

01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:25.540
You didn't try to help me.
You did nothing.

01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:27.370
Everyone in the van.

01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:29.740
- (Cole) Hold on.
- l don't care what you think!

01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:32.620
l'm not lowering myself to their level.

01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:05.790
Come in, HMS Valiant.

01:16:05.910 --> 01:16:10.540
'This is HMS Valiant. Five miles east

lt's me, Matt.
Come on, it's Matt.

01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:56.950
What is it, mate? What?

Stop.

What if it happens
when we're in the air?

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.200
- What then?
- Why don't you shut up?

01:18:07.330 --> 01:18:10.120
- Am l the only one concerned?
- (Cole) How's your hand?

01:18:11.950 --> 01:18:12.990
lt's stopped hurting.

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:14.740
- Has it?
- Yes.

01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:16.870
- lt has.
- Good.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.120
Stop the van.

01:18:18.250 --> 01:18:20.910
- What?
- Stop the van, Cole!

01:18:24.250 --> 01:18:26.240
l'm not going.

01:18:26.370 --> 01:18:29.740
- You're forgetting something.
- The real monsters are in this van.

01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:32.080
- l know that.
- They can have their helicopter.

01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:36.290
l'll take my chances on the road with Joe.
l can't stop those things getting to us.

01:18:36.410 --> 01:18:38.450
But l can stop this lot.

01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:41.240
- They would rather see me dead.
- Now you listen to me.

01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:43.450
l've got you this far, haven't l?

01:18:44.250 --> 01:18:47.830
And l'll get you to the finish line,
because l know l can.

01:18:47.950 --> 01:18:50.790
But you have to let me finish
what l've started.

01:18:50.910 --> 01:18:52.370
You have to.

01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:56.870
You're the only hope for a cure.

01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:01.040
- OK.
- Ange,

01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:04.290
you cannot let them
turn you into a lab rat.

01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:07.080
(Angela) Oh, shit!

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:10.540
Go!

01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:12.120
Move!

01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:27.120
Abraxon, through the gates.

- No, no, no, no!

01:22:01.370 --> 01:22:02.410
l'm sorry.

Let's go.

01:22:53.290 --> 01:22:54.740
No.

01:22:55.580 --> 01:22:57.040
Let us go, Cole.

01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:00.120
Let us go. You know
what they're going to do to her,

01:23:00.910 --> 01:23:03.740
l can't let that happen.
You four, you take the helicopter.

01:23:03.870 --> 01:23:07.200
We'll take that truck there.
lt's like a tank. Everybody wins.

01:23:07.330 --> 01:23:10.080
- No, you won't stand a chance, Joe.
- Well, we can try.

01:23:14.910 --> 01:23:17.240
l have to do this.

01:23:17.370 --> 01:23:19.080
For everyone's sake.

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:20.240
- Come on.
- Angie!

01:23:20.370 --> 01:23:21.910
l can't let you do this!

01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:39.660
Matt?

01:23:42.830 --> 01:23:44.910
We're not going anywhere!

01:23:51.290 --> 01:23:52.540
Fuck!

01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:55.370
Now what do we do?

01:23:56.450 --> 01:23:58.410
- Angie.
- Matt, oh.

01:23:59.450 --> 01:24:00.830
Are you OK?

01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:03.830
Listen, l've got a Zodiac on the river.

01:24:03.950 --> 01:24:06.950
The HMS Valiant
is ten miles downstream to the east.

01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:09.620
Whatever these things are,
they fucking hate water.

01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:11.540
So l think we can make it, OK?

01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:13.910
- l don't even know you.
- Trust him.

01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:15.490
- Are you sure?
- l'm sure.

01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:17.620
Just trust him. He's my brother.

01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:19.540
- Come on, Joe.
- OK, let's go.

01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:21.450
Come on! Let's go!

01:24:24.910 --> 01:24:26.620
Oh, Geoffrey!

01:24:26.750 --> 01:24:28.660
Geoffrey! Help him!

01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:31.240
Geoffrey!

01:24:31.370 --> 01:24:32.830
- Go and get the boat ready now.
- What's happening?

01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:35.200
Leave him. He's got it.
Nothing you can do. Go.

01:24:35.330 --> 01:24:39.580
- Come on.
- You fucking help him!

01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:41.740
Or l'll kill her.

01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:44.040
- No.
- l'll scream.

01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:48.160
- l'll scream so loud they'll all come.
- No, you won't.

01:24:48.290 --> 01:24:49.950
Help him. Help him!

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.870
You let her go now.

01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:04.160
Get to the boat. Go.

01:25:04.290 --> 01:25:06.790
Give me the gun.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.490
Lavie, don't leave me.

01:25:19.250 --> 01:25:21.740
- l'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.

01:25:21.870 --> 01:25:25.200
You should never
have threatened her, ever.

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:47.540
l just wanted to save you.

01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:50.410
They're coming, they're coming!

01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:14.330
What the hell's he doing here?

No. No! No, don't!

01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:40.580
Just get her on the boat!

01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:46.700
No!

01:26:58.410 --> 01:27:00.240
Just take her and go.

01:27:00.370 --> 01:27:01.950
Oi, no, Joe, come on.

01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:03.620
You're coming with us.

01:27:08.830 --> 01:27:09.870

(Cole) 'l've done so many bad things
in my life.'

01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:34.790
But l'm not asking for forgiveness.

Come on, let's go. Let's go.

01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:54.580
What did that guy mean?

01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:58.990
When he said, "Do the right thing",
what did he mean?

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:01.200
l need to see some doctors.

01:31:01.330 --> 01:31:02.790
As soon as l can.
