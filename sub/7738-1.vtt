00:00.001 --> 00:02.554
- _
- My brother is a murderer.

00:02.578 --> 00:05.572
No chance for you to be a
hero this time, Mr Holmes.

00:05.573 --> 00:06.971
Oh, do your research.

00:06.973 --> 00:11.372
I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.

00:11.373 --> 00:13.452
Merry Christmas!

00:14.853 --> 00:17.932
I'm not given to outbursts
of brotherly compassion.

00:17.933 --> 00:20.093
You know what happened to the other one.

00:24.813 --> 00:26.132
Miss me?

00:26.133 --> 00:28.532
'Did you miss me? Did you
miss me? Did you miss me?'

00:28.533 --> 00:30.372
I've only been gone four minutes.

00:30.373 --> 00:32.493
Well, I certainly hope
you've learnt your lesson.

00:35.573 --> 00:36.972
What you're about to see is

00:36.973 --> 00:39.252
classified beyond top secret.

00:39.253 --> 00:43.852
Is that quite clear?
Don't minute any of this.

00:43.853 --> 00:46.813
Once beyond these walls,
you must never speak of it.

00:47.813 --> 00:50.572
A D notice has been slapped
on the entire incident.

00:50.573 --> 00:52.372
Only those within this room,

00:52.373 --> 00:56.212
code names Antarctica,
Langdale, Porlock and Love,

00:56.213 --> 00:58.612
will ever know the whole truth.

00:58.613 --> 01:00.492
As far as everyone else is concerned,

01:00.493 --> 01:02.212
going to the Prime Minister

01:02.213 --> 01:04.772
and way beyond, Charles Augustus...

01:04.772 --> 01:06.932
- Are you tweeting?!
- No.

01:06.933 --> 01:08.909
Well, that's what it looks like!
Of course I'm not tweeting.

01:08.933 --> 01:10.010
Why would I be tweeting?

01:10.035 --> 01:11.132
- Give me that!
- What? No!

01:11.133 --> 01:12.249
What are you doing?!

01:12.274 --> 01:13.557
- Get off!
- Give it here!

01:14.973 --> 01:17.212
- "Back on terra firma."
- Don't read them out.

01:17.213 --> 01:19.492
- "Free as a bird."
- God, you're such a spoilsport.

01:19.493 --> 01:21.173
Will you take this matter
seriously, Sherlock?

01:21.197 --> 01:23.772
I am! What makes you think
I'm not taking it seriously?

01:23.773 --> 01:25.932
"#OhWhatABeautifulMorning"

01:25.933 --> 01:28.572
Look, not so long ago I was on a
mission that meant certain death -

01:28.573 --> 01:29.289
my death!

01:29.314 --> 01:32.372
And now I'm back, in a nice warm
office, with my big brother and...

01:32.373 --> 01:33.692
Are those ginger nuts?

01:33.693 --> 01:35.692
- Oh, God...
- Love ginger nuts.

01:35.693 --> 01:37.572
Our doctor said you were clean.

01:37.573 --> 01:39.292
I am. Utterly.

01:39.293 --> 01:42.492
No need for stimulants now,
remember? I have work to do.

01:42.493 --> 01:43.892
You're high as a kite!

01:43.893 --> 01:46.612
Natural high, I assure you.
Totally natural.

01:46.613 --> 01:49.252
I'm just... ♪ ..glad to be alive! ♪

01:49.253 --> 01:51.812
What shall we do next? What's your name?

01:51.813 --> 01:53.052
Vivian.

01:53.053 --> 01:55.492
- What would you do, Vivian?
- Pardon?

01:55.493 --> 01:58.212
Well, it's a lovely day. Go for a stroll?

01:58.213 --> 02:01.052
Make a paper aeroplane? Have an ice lolly?

02:01.053 --> 02:02.572
Ice lolly, I suppose.

02:02.573 --> 02:04.412
Ice lolly it is!

02:04.413 --> 02:07.052
- What's your favourite?
- Well, really, I shouldn't...

02:07.053 --> 02:10.172
- Go on.
- Do they still do Mivvies?

02:10.173 --> 02:12.053
- Mr Holmes...
- Yes?

02:13.413 --> 02:16.692
- ...we do need to get on.
- Yes, of course.

02:20.413 --> 02:21.892
'Do your research.

02:21.893 --> 02:25.452
'I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.

02:26.773 --> 02:28.772
..sociopath.

02:28.773 --> 02:31.332
..sociopath.'

02:31.333 --> 02:33.812
I see. Who is supposed to have
shot him, then?

02:33.813 --> 02:37.452
Some over-eager squaddie with an
itchy trigger finger - that's who.

02:37.453 --> 02:40.852
- That's not what happened at all.
- It is now.

02:40.853 --> 02:43.132
Remarkable. How did you do it?

02:43.133 --> 02:46.172
We have some very talented
people working here.

02:46.173 --> 02:49.092
If James Moriarty can hack
every TV screen in the land,

02:49.093 --> 02:53.013
rest assured we have the tech to
doctor a bit of security footage.

02:54.373 --> 02:56.732
That is now the official version,

02:56.733 --> 02:59.332
the version anyone we want to will see.

02:59.333 --> 03:01.092
No need to go to the trouble of getting

03:01.093 --> 03:03.132
some sort of official pardon.

03:03.133 --> 03:06.052
You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.

03:06.053 --> 03:07.892
You're home and dry.

03:07.893 --> 03:09.092
OK, cheers.

03:09.093 --> 03:11.652
Obviously, there's unfinished business.

03:11.653 --> 03:12.892
Moriarty.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.692
I told you - Moriarty's dead.

03:14.693 --> 03:17.692
You say he filmed that video
message before he died.

03:17.693 --> 03:19.092
Yes.

03:19.093 --> 03:22.972
You also say you know what
he's going to do next.

03:22.973 --> 03:26.012
- What does that mean?
- Perhaps that's all there is to it.

03:26.013 --> 03:27.852
Perhaps he was just
trying to frighten you.

03:27.853 --> 03:30.333
No, no, he would never
be that disappointing.

03:31.693 --> 03:33.612
He's planned something,
something long-term.

03:33.613 --> 03:35.732
Something that would take
effect if he never made it

03:35.733 --> 03:37.532
off that rooftop alive.

03:37.533 --> 03:38.972
Posthumous revenge.

03:38.973 --> 03:42.332
No, better than that - posthumous game.

03:42.333 --> 03:44.172
We brought you back to deal with this.

03:44.173 --> 03:46.612
- What are you going to do?
- Wait.

03:46.613 --> 03:48.052
Wait?!

03:48.053 --> 03:50.932
Of course wait.
I'm the target - targets wait.

03:50.933 --> 03:54.412
Look, whatever's coming,
whatever he's lined up,

03:54.413 --> 03:55.732
I'll know when it begins.

03:55.733 --> 03:58.332
I always know when the game is on.
Do you know why?

03:58.333 --> 03:59.892
Why?

03:59.893 --> 04:01.213
Because I love it.

04:35.333 --> 04:38.612
There was once a merchant,
in the famous market at Baghdad.

04:38.613 --> 04:41.012
One day he saw a stranger

04:41.013 --> 04:43.292
looking at him in surprise,

04:43.293 --> 04:47.572
and he knew that the stranger was Death.

04:47.573 --> 04:50.532
Pale and trembling,
the merchant fled the marketplace

04:50.533 --> 04:54.893
and made his way many, many miles,
to the city of Samarra.

04:56.173 --> 05:00.052
For there he was sure
Death could not find him.

05:00.053 --> 05:02.012
But when, at last, he came to Samarra,

05:02.013 --> 05:06.493
the merchant saw, waiting for him,
the grim figure of Death.

05:09.533 --> 05:14.069
"Very well," said the merchant.
"I give in. I am yours."

05:17.013 --> 05:19.052
"But tell me, why did you look surprised

05:19.053 --> 05:21.293
when you saw me this
morning in Baghdad?"

05:23.373 --> 05:26.212
"Because," said Death,

05:26.213 --> 05:28.733
"I had an appointment with you tonight...

05:30.133 --> 05:31.373
..in Samarra."

05:41.213 --> 05:43.612
If this gets any better,
I'm going to get two knives.

05:43.613 --> 05:44.732
Pays to advertise.

05:44.733 --> 05:46.932
- So, what about Moriarty, then?
- Oh, I have a plan.

05:46.933 --> 05:48.812
I'm going to monitor the underworld,

05:48.813 --> 05:52.692
every quiver of the web will tell
me when the spider makes his move.

05:52.693 --> 05:54.732
So, basically,
your plan is just to sit there

05:54.733 --> 05:56.892
solving crimes like you always do?

05:56.893 --> 05:58.213
Awesome, isn't it?

05:59.733 --> 06:02.892
He drowned, Mr Holmes.
That's what we thought.

06:02.893 --> 06:05.205
- But when they opened up his lungs...
- Yes?

06:05.227 --> 06:05.972
..sand.

06:05.973 --> 06:07.573
Superficial.

06:10.133 --> 06:12.132
Come back! It's the wrong thumb.

06:15.560 --> 06:18.118
_

06:18.373 --> 06:20.173
Sherlock... It's never twins.

06:22.133 --> 06:24.492
Hopkins, arrest Wilson.
Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.

06:24.493 --> 06:26.212
- 'Wilson?' 'Lymph nodes?'
- Sherlock...

06:26.213 --> 06:28.572
Yes, you may have nothing but
a limbless torso, but there'll

06:28.573 --> 06:30.732
be traces of ink in the lymph
nodes under the armpits.

06:30.733 --> 06:32.603
If your mystery corpse had tattoos,
the signs will be there.

06:32.627 --> 06:35.372
- 'Bloody hell! Is that a guess?'
- I never guess.

06:35.373 --> 06:37.375
- Sherlock...
- 'So, he's the killer?

06:37.400 --> 06:38.612
The canary trainer?'

06:38.613 --> 06:40.772
- Of course he's the killer.
- 'Didn't see that coming.'

06:40.773 --> 06:42.092
Hm, naturally.

06:42.093 --> 06:45.132
Sherlock, you can't go
on spinning plates like this.

06:45.133 --> 06:46.972
That's it! The place was spinning.

06:46.973 --> 06:50.772
The heart medication you're taking
is known to cause bouts of amnesia.

06:50.773 --> 06:53.892
Yes, I... I think so. Why?

06:53.893 --> 06:56.692
Because the fingerprints on your
brother's neck were your own.

06:56.693 --> 06:58.852
- A jellyfish?
- I know.

06:58.853 --> 07:00.355
You can't arrest a jellyfish.

07:00.380 --> 07:01.964
- You could try.
- We did try.

07:01.989 --> 07:05.468
Oh...

07:05.493 --> 07:07.046
- Oh, God.
- Mary?

07:07.071 --> 07:08.932
59 missed calls.

07:08.933 --> 07:10.292
We're in a lot of trouble.

07:12.013 --> 07:15.572
Ow! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

07:15.573 --> 07:16.972
Relax, it's got two syllables...

07:16.973 --> 07:19.172
I'm a nurse, darling -
I think I know what to do!

07:19.173 --> 07:21.452
- Come on, then...
- Re! Lax!

07:21.453 --> 07:24.932
No, just drive, please, God,
just drive! God, drive!

07:24.933 --> 07:27.172
Sherlock - Mary!

07:27.173 --> 07:29.292
That's it, Mary - re...

07:29.293 --> 07:31.972
- Don't you start!
- ...lax.

07:31.973 --> 07:36.292
John, John... I think
you have to pull over!

07:36.293 --> 07:38.892
- Mary, Mary...
- Pull over!

07:38.893 --> 07:42.053
Oh, my God!

07:46.653 --> 07:48.372
Has that come out?

07:48.373 --> 07:50.132
They never come out
when I take them.

07:50.157 --> 07:51.012
Let's have a look.

07:51.013 --> 07:53.573
Aw, she's so beautiful.

07:55.133 --> 07:57.092
- Have another go.
- What about a name?

07:57.093 --> 07:58.932
- Catherine.
- Uh, yeah, we've gone off that.

07:58.933 --> 07:59.644
Have we?

07:59.669 --> 08:00.532
- Yeah.
- Oh.

08:00.533 --> 08:03.092
- Well, you know what I think...
- It's not a girl's name.

08:03.093 --> 08:06.452
Molly, Mrs H, we would
love you to be godparents.

08:06.453 --> 08:08.563
- Oh! Really?
- If you...

08:08.588 --> 08:10.372
That's so lovely.

08:10.373 --> 08:14.412
And, uh... you too, Sherlock?

08:14.413 --> 08:17.212
- You too what?
- Godfather, we'd like you to be godfather.

08:17.213 --> 08:19.412
God is a ludicrous fiction,
dreamt up by inadequates

08:19.413 --> 08:22.372
who abnegate all responsibility
to an invisible magic friend.

08:22.373 --> 08:24.292
Yeah, but there'll be cake. Will you do it?

08:24.293 --> 08:25.572
I'll get back to you.

08:25.573 --> 08:28.572
Father, we ask you to send
your blessings on this water

08:28.573 --> 08:32.852
and sanctify it for our use this day.

08:32.852 --> 08:34.692
In Christ's name.

08:34.693 --> 08:37.611
Now, what name have you
given your daughter?

08:37.613 --> 08:38.852
Rosamund Mary.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.011
Rosamund?

08:40.013 --> 08:42.653
It means "Rose of the world".
Rosie for short.

08:44.133 --> 08:46.052
Didn't you get John's text?

08:46.053 --> 08:50.492
No. I delete his texts.
I delete any text that begins "Hi."

08:50.493 --> 08:53.332
No idea why people think you're
incapable of human emotion.

08:53.333 --> 08:54.892
Sorry.

08:54.893 --> 08:56.572
Phone!

08:56.573 --> 09:01.612
And now, godparents, are you ready
to help the parents of this child

09:01.613 --> 09:04.052
in their duties as Christian parents?

09:04.053 --> 09:05.692
We are.

09:05.693 --> 09:08.332
'Sorry, I didn't catch that.

09:08.333 --> 09:09.973
'Please repeat the question.'

09:11.453 --> 09:14.052
As ever, Watson, you
see but do not observe.

09:14.053 --> 09:16.412
To you, the world remains
an impenetrable mystery,

09:16.413 --> 09:17.772
whereas, to me, it is an open book.

09:17.773 --> 09:20.812
Hard logic versus romantic whimsy -
that is your choice.

09:20.813 --> 09:23.732
You fail to connect actions
to their consequences.

09:23.733 --> 09:26.932
Now, for the last time,
if you want to keep the rattle,

09:26.933 --> 09:28.813
do not throw the rattle.

10:32.333 --> 10:35.493
All right, good girl,
good girl. Good girl.

10:37.013 --> 10:38.973
I'd better finish this, hadn't I?

10:47.382 --> 10:48.588
- Hey.
- Afternoon.

10:48.613 --> 10:50.652
He says you've got a good one, Greg?

10:50.653 --> 10:53.052
Oh, yeah.

10:53.053 --> 10:55.892
It was David Welsborough's 50th birthday.

10:59.773 --> 11:01.652
God, 50!

11:01.653 --> 11:02.772
Where does it go?

11:02.773 --> 11:04.932
I know for a fact I was
only 21 this time last week.

11:04.933 --> 11:07.772
Yeah, well that's impossible.
That was before you met me.

11:07.773 --> 11:11.333
- Well, no, no, there never was...
- "There never was such a time."

11:12.493 --> 11:15.132
She's looking at me disapprovingly again.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.212
No. She's just jealous.

11:17.213 --> 11:19.372
Yeah, well, I think we both are.

11:20.289 --> 11:21.452
- Oh...
- No, no, David.

11:21.453 --> 11:23.333
- Come on, you promised.
- No, it's...

11:24.382 --> 11:26.892
Oh, no... Oh, it's a Skype call.

11:26.893 --> 11:30.893
Oh! Then it must be Charlie.
At least he's phoning, I suppose.

11:32.093 --> 11:33.652
Oh, look! Hello!

11:33.653 --> 11:36.332
'Hey, Dad. Happy birthday.

11:36.333 --> 11:40.253
Sorry to miss the party,
but travel broadens the mind, right?'

11:42.013 --> 11:44.332
No! Picture's frozen!

11:44.333 --> 11:46.412
'Yeah, signal's rubbish.
But I can still hear you.'

11:46.413 --> 11:48.092
Why is it rubbish? Where are you?

11:48.093 --> 11:50.292
How is he? Is he eating?
Ask him if he's eating.

11:50.293 --> 11:52.132
David? Come on!

11:52.133 --> 11:55.172
OK, no, hang on a sec,
I'll find somewhere quieter.

11:55.173 --> 11:57.132
So, Charlie, where are you?

11:57.133 --> 11:58.852
Are you there?

11:58.853 --> 12:01.812
- 'Sorry, I'm here. I'm just a bit...'
- Are you all right?

12:01.813 --> 12:04.602
'It's nothing. Probably
just the altitude.'

12:04.627 --> 12:05.532
Altitude?

12:05.533 --> 12:07.562
'I'm in Tibet. Didn't
you see the mountains?'

12:07.587 --> 12:08.532
Never mind mountains.

12:08.533 --> 12:10.772
Your mother wants to know
if you're eating properly.

12:10.773 --> 12:12.692
- 'Listen, Dad, could you do me a favour?'
- What?

12:12.693 --> 12:14.334
'Could you just check
something on my car?'

12:14.358 --> 12:15.292
Your car?

12:15.293 --> 12:17.452
'To settle a bet.
The guys here don't believe

12:17.453 --> 12:19.212
I've got a Power Ranger
stuck to the bonnet.

12:19.213 --> 12:22.053
- 'Could you take a photo and send it?'
- Uh, yes, I can do that.

12:25.853 --> 12:27.732
All done. Have you got it?

12:27.733 --> 12:28.893
Charlie?

12:30.933 --> 12:33.012
A week later...

12:33.013 --> 12:34.332
Yeah?

12:34.333 --> 12:37.252
...something really weird happens.

12:37.253 --> 12:40.132
Drunk driver, he's totally smashed,
the cops are chasing him,

12:40.133 --> 12:42.412
and he turns into the drive
of the Welsborough house

12:42.413 --> 12:43.932
to try and get away.

12:43.933 --> 12:45.573
Unfortunately...

12:57.853 --> 13:00.252
The drunk guy survived,
they managed to pull him out,

13:00.253 --> 13:03.413
but when they put the fire out
and examined the parked car...

13:04.893 --> 13:06.292
Whose body?

13:06.293 --> 13:08.412
Charlie Welsborough, the son.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.272
- What?
- The son who was in Tibet.

13:10.297 --> 13:11.532
DNA all checks out.

13:11.533 --> 13:13.412
Night of the party, the car's empty,

13:13.413 --> 13:15.492
and a week later...

13:15.493 --> 13:17.052
the dead boy's found at the wheel.

13:18.813 --> 13:21.612
- Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.
- Have you got a lab report?

13:21.613 --> 13:24.412
Yeah, Charlie Welsborough's
the son of a Cabinet Minister,

13:24.413 --> 13:26.452
so I'm under a lot of
pressure to get a result.

13:26.453 --> 13:28.812
Who cares about that?
Tell me about the seats.

13:28.813 --> 13:30.893
- The seats?
- Yes, the car seats.

13:34.493 --> 13:35.932
Made of vinyl.

13:35.933 --> 13:38.332
Two different types of vinyl present.

13:38.333 --> 13:39.932
Was it his own car?

13:39.933 --> 13:41.892
Yeah, not flash - he was a student.

13:41.893 --> 13:43.452
- Well, that's suggestive.
- Why?

13:43.453 --> 13:46.252
- Vinyl's cheaper than leather.
- Yeah, right?

13:46.253 --> 13:47.732
- There's something else.
- Yes?

13:47.733 --> 13:48.812
According to this,

13:48.813 --> 13:51.373
Charlie Welsborough had
already been dead for a week.

13:52.773 --> 13:54.332
What?

13:54.333 --> 13:56.652
The body in the car, dead for a week.

13:56.653 --> 13:58.932
Oh, this is a good one. Is it my birthday?

13:58.933 --> 14:00.492
You want help?

14:00.493 --> 14:02.692
- Yes, please. OK.
- One condition.

14:02.693 --> 14:05.692
Take all the credit. It gets
boring if I just solve them all.

14:05.693 --> 14:06.852
Yeah, you say that,

14:06.853 --> 14:09.292
but then John blogs about it,
and you get all the credit anyway.

14:09.293 --> 14:10.452
He's got a point.

14:10.453 --> 14:12.652
Which makes me look like
some kind of prima donna

14:12.653 --> 14:14.932
who insists on getting credit
for something he didn't do!

14:14.933 --> 14:16.812
Well, I think you've hit a
sore spot, Sherlock.

14:16.813 --> 14:19.892
- Like I'm some kind of credit junkie.
- Definitely a sore spot.

14:19.893 --> 14:22.023
So you take all the glory, thanks...

14:22.048 --> 14:23.692
- OK!
- ...thanks all the same.

14:23.693 --> 14:26.412
Look, just solve the bloody thing,
will you? It's driving me nuts.

14:26.413 --> 14:28.093
Anything you say, Giles.

14:30.213 --> 14:31.772
Just kidding.

14:31.773 --> 14:33.172
What's his name?

14:33.173 --> 14:34.572
Greg. What?

14:34.573 --> 14:36.812
Greg.

14:36.813 --> 14:38.812
It's obvious though,
isn't it, what happened?

14:38.813 --> 14:40.532
John, you amaze me.
You know what happened?

14:40.533 --> 14:42.772
Not a clue. It's just you
normally say that at this point.

14:42.773 --> 14:47.524
Hmm. Well, then, let's hope you
solve your little problem, Greg.

14:48.373 --> 14:49.533
- Hear that?
- I know.

14:50.813 --> 14:54.372
- So, how's it going then, fatherhood?
- Oh, good, great. Yeah, amazing.

14:54.373 --> 14:56.092
- Getting any sleep?
- Christ, no.

14:56.093 --> 14:58.812
You're at the beck and call of a
screaming, demanding baby,

14:58.813 --> 15:01.572
woken up at all hours
to obey its every whim.

15:01.573 --> 15:04.172
- Must feel very different...
- Sorry, what?

15:04.173 --> 15:05.652
Yes, well, you know how it is.

15:05.653 --> 15:07.852
All you do is clean up their mess,
pat them on the head.

15:07.853 --> 15:10.652
- Are you two having a little joke?
- Never a word of thanks.

15:10.653 --> 15:13.172
Can't even tell people's faces apart.

15:13.173 --> 15:14.412
This is a joke, isn't it?

15:14.413 --> 15:17.052
Yeah, and it's all, "Oh, aren't you
clever. You're so, so clever."

15:17.053 --> 15:18.972
- Is it about me?
- I think he needs winding.

15:18.973 --> 15:20.863
You know, I think that
really might be it.

15:20.888 --> 15:22.372
No, don't get it.

15:22.373 --> 15:25.092
Charlie's family are pretty cut
up about it, as you'd expect,

15:25.093 --> 15:26.522
so go easy on them, yeah?

15:26.547 --> 15:27.807
- You know me.
- 'Hey, hello.'

15:27.831 --> 15:29.348
Yeah. Got them, don't worry.

15:29.373 --> 15:31.292
Pampers, the cream you
can't get from Boots.

15:31.293 --> 15:33.212
Yeah, never mind about that.
Where are you now?

15:33.213 --> 15:34.772
- At the dead boy's house?
- Yeah.

15:34.773 --> 15:37.012
'And what does he think? Any theories?'

15:37.013 --> 15:38.612
Well, I texted you the details.

15:38.613 --> 15:40.932
Yeah, two different types of vinyl.

15:40.933 --> 15:42.332
- Hey!
- How do you know about that?

15:42.333 --> 15:45.092
'Oh you'd be amazed at what
a receptionist picks up.'

15:45.093 --> 15:47.892
- They know everything!
- 'Solved it, then?'

15:47.893 --> 15:48.977
I'm working on it.

15:49.002 --> 15:50.492
'Oh, Mary, motherhood's
slowing you down.'

15:50.493 --> 15:52.372
- Pig!
- Keep trying.

15:52.373 --> 15:54.012
'So, what about it, then?

15:54.013 --> 15:56.652
'What, an empty car that suddenly
has a week-old corpse in it?

15:56.653 --> 15:58.532
'And what are you
going to call this one?'

15:58.533 --> 16:00.252
Oh, the Ghost Driver.

16:00.253 --> 16:02.172
- Don't give it a title.
- People like the titles.

16:02.173 --> 16:04.332
- They hate the titles.
- Give the people what they want.

16:04.333 --> 16:06.012
No, never do that - people are stupid.

16:06.013 --> 16:07.852
Uh, some people.

16:07.853 --> 16:09.572
'All people are stupid.

16:09.573 --> 16:10.852
Most people.'

16:10.853 --> 16:12.652
'Bizarre enough though,
isn't it, to be him?'

16:12.653 --> 16:14.373
I mean, it's right up your strasse.

16:16.733 --> 16:19.452
Mr and Mrs Welsborough,
I really am most terribly sorry

16:19.453 --> 16:20.755
to hear about your daughter.

16:20.780 --> 16:21.452
- Son.
- Son!

16:21.453 --> 16:23.892
Mr and Mrs Welsborough,
this is Mr Sherlock Holmes.

16:23.893 --> 16:26.047
Thank you very much for coming.
We've heard a great deal about you.

16:26.071 --> 16:29.532
If anyone can throw any light into
this darkness, surely it will be you.

16:29.533 --> 16:31.373
Well, I believe that I...

16:32.813 --> 16:34.053
...can.

16:35.213 --> 16:38.133
But Charlie was our
whole world, Mr Holmes. I...

16:46.853 --> 16:48.492
Sherlock?

16:48.493 --> 16:49.652
Mr Holmes?

16:49.653 --> 16:50.732
Sorry, you were saying?

16:50.733 --> 16:53.252
Well, Charlie was our
whole world, Mr Holmes.

16:53.253 --> 16:55.452
I... I don't think we'll
ever get over this.

16:55.453 --> 16:56.853
No. Shouldn't think so.

17:01.493 --> 17:04.173
So sorry, will you excuse
me a moment? I just...

17:06.813 --> 17:08.933
I'll... I'll just, um... Ahem.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.932
- Now what's wrong?
- Not sure, I just...

17:15.933 --> 17:18.531
By the pricking of my thumbs.

17:18.532 --> 17:19.771
Seriously? You?

17:19.772 --> 17:21.372
Intuitions are not to be ignored, John.

17:21.373 --> 17:23.092
They represent data processed too fast

17:23.093 --> 17:24.652
for the conscious mind to comprehend.

17:24.653 --> 17:26.172
What is this?

17:26.173 --> 17:29.892
Oh, it's a sort of shrine,
I suppose, really.

17:29.893 --> 17:31.972
Bit of a fan of Mrs T.

17:31.973 --> 17:35.012
A big hero of mine when
I was getting started.

17:35.013 --> 17:36.293
Right, yes.

17:40.693 --> 17:42.732
- Who?
- What?

17:42.733 --> 17:44.452
- Who...? Who was this?
- Are you serious?

17:44.453 --> 17:47.572
- Sherlock...
- It's... It's Margaret Thatcher,

17:47.573 --> 17:50.052
the first female Prime
Minister of this country.

17:50.053 --> 17:51.172
Right.

17:51.173 --> 17:54.493
- Prime Minister? Right.
- Leader of the Government.

17:55.653 --> 17:57.048
- Female?
- For God's sake!

17:57.073 --> 17:59.292
You know perfectly well who she is.

17:59.293 --> 18:00.812
Why are you playing for time?

18:00.813 --> 18:03.412
It's the gap, look at the gap. It's wrong.

18:03.413 --> 18:06.213
Everything else is perfectly
ordered, managed.

18:07.453 --> 18:09.732
The whole thing's verging on OCD.
My respects.

18:09.733 --> 18:11.732
This figurine is routinely
repositioned after

18:11.733 --> 18:14.002
the cleaner's been in,
this picture is straightened every day,

18:14.026 --> 18:15.492
yet this ugly gap remains.

18:15.493 --> 18:18.052
- Something's missing from here,
but only recently. - Yes, a...

18:18.053 --> 18:20.972
- Plaster bust... - plaster bust.
- Oh, for God's sake! It got broken.

18:20.973 --> 18:23.092
What the hell has this
got to do with Charlie?

18:23.093 --> 18:24.568
- Rug!
- What?

18:24.593 --> 18:25.492
Well, how could it get broken?

18:25.493 --> 18:28.572
The only place for it to fall is the
floor and there is a big thick rug.

18:28.573 --> 18:31.052
- Does it matter?
- Mrs Welsborough, my apologies.

18:31.053 --> 18:33.732
- It is worth letting him do this.
- Is your friend quite mad?

18:33.733 --> 18:35.652
No, he's an arsehole,
but it's an easy mistake.

18:35.653 --> 18:38.932
Look, no, we had a break-in,
some little bastard smashed it to bits.

18:38.933 --> 18:40.772
We found the remains
out there in the porch.

18:40.773 --> 18:43.132
- The porch where we came in?
- How anybody could hate her so much

18:43.133 --> 18:45.492
they'd go to the trouble
of smashing her likeness...

18:45.493 --> 18:48.092
I'm no expert,
but, uh, possibly her face.

18:48.093 --> 18:50.412
Why didn't he smash all the others?
Perfect opportunity,

18:50.413 --> 18:52.012
and look at that one - she's smiling.

18:52.013 --> 18:53.852
Oh, Inspector,
this is clearly a waste of time.

18:53.853 --> 18:56.892
- And if there's nothing...
- I know what happened to your son.

18:56.893 --> 18:58.132
You do?

18:58.133 --> 19:00.252
It's quite simple,
superficial, to be blunt.

19:00.253 --> 19:02.252
But first, tell me,
the night of the break-in,

19:02.253 --> 19:03.612
this room was in darkness?

19:03.613 --> 19:05.852
- Well, yes.
- And the porch where it was smashed,

19:05.853 --> 19:07.652
I noticed the motion sensor was damaged,

19:07.653 --> 19:10.012
- so I assume it's permanently lit.
- How did you notice that?

19:10.013 --> 19:12.572
I lack the arrogance to ignore details.
I'm not the police.

19:12.573 --> 19:14.972
- So you're saying he smashed it
where he could see it. - Exactly.

19:14.973 --> 19:16.932
- Why?
- Don't know. Wouldn't be fun if I knew.

19:16.933 --> 19:18.493
Mr Holmes, please!

19:20.613 --> 19:23.212
It was your 50th birthday,
Mr Welsborough, of course you were

19:23.237 --> 19:25.563
disappointed that your son hadn't
made it back from his gap year.

19:25.564 --> 19:27.652
- After all, he was in Tibet.
- Yes.

19:27.653 --> 19:29.452
- No.
- No?

19:29.453 --> 19:32.372
♪ Happy birthday... ♪

19:32.373 --> 19:36.052
The first part of your conversation was,
in fact, pre-recorded video.

19:36.053 --> 19:37.333
Easily arranged.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.772
It's a Skype call.

19:42.773 --> 19:44.772
The trick was meant to be a surprise.

19:44.773 --> 19:46.892
- A trick?
- Obviously.

19:46.893 --> 19:49.012
Could you take a photo and send it?

19:49.013 --> 19:52.452
There were two types of vinyl in
the burnt-out remains of the car.

19:52.453 --> 19:55.212
One, the actual passenger seat,
the other, a good copy.

19:55.213 --> 19:56.373
Well, good enough.

19:58.025 --> 19:59.465
Effectively a costume.

20:02.413 --> 20:03.692
You're joking?

20:03.693 --> 20:05.932
No, I'm not.

20:05.933 --> 20:08.012
All he wanted was for you to
get close enough to the car

20:08.013 --> 20:09.533
so he could spring the surprise.

20:13.173 --> 20:15.573
- Oh, my God!
- Surprise!

20:17.773 --> 20:19.852
That's when it happened.

20:19.853 --> 20:21.092
I can't be certain, of course,

20:21.093 --> 20:23.892
but I think Charlie must have
suffered some sort of a seizure.

20:23.893 --> 20:25.492
You said he'd felt unwell?

20:25.493 --> 20:26.532
You all right?

20:26.533 --> 20:29.252
'It's nothing. Probably
just the altitude.'

20:29.253 --> 20:30.813
He died there and then.

20:35.333 --> 20:37.292
No-one had any cause to go near his car,

20:37.293 --> 20:40.373
so there he remained,
in the driver's seat, hidden, until...

20:45.773 --> 20:48.292
When the two cars were examined,

20:48.293 --> 20:52.252
the fake seat had melted in
the fire, revealing Charlie,

20:52.253 --> 20:55.493
who'd been sitting there,
quite dead, for a week.

20:56.573 --> 20:58.093
Oh, God!

20:59.853 --> 21:00.972
Poor kid.

21:00.973 --> 21:03.893
Really, I'm so sorry.
Mr Welsborough, Mrs Welsborough.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.092
This is where it was smashed.

21:09.093 --> 21:10.801
- That was amazing.
- What?

21:10.826 --> 21:12.212
The car, the kid.

21:12.213 --> 21:14.292
Ancient history.
Why are you still talking about it?

21:14.293 --> 21:16.772
What's so important about a
broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?

21:16.773 --> 21:19.372
I can't stand it, never can.
There's a loose thread in the world.

21:19.373 --> 21:20.852
It doesn't mean you have to pull on it.

21:20.853 --> 21:21.968
What kind of a life would that be?

21:21.992 --> 21:24.551
Besides, I have the strangest feeling...

21:24.576 --> 21:25.736
Miss me?

21:26.933 --> 21:30.092
- That's mine. You two take a... bus.
- Why?

21:30.093 --> 21:32.772
I need to concentrate,
and I don't want to hit you.

21:32.773 --> 21:33.933
The Mall, please.

21:37.013 --> 21:38.550
- I met her once.
- Thatcher?

21:38.575 --> 21:40.332
Rather arrogant, I thought.

21:40.333 --> 21:42.252
- You thought that?!
- Ha, I know.

21:42.253 --> 21:43.493
Why am I looking at this?

21:44.533 --> 21:46.772
That's her, John and Mary's baby.

21:46.773 --> 21:48.932
Oh, I see, yes.

21:48.933 --> 21:52.173
Looks very... fully functioning.

21:53.100 --> 21:54.692
Is that really the best you can do?

21:54.693 --> 21:56.932
Sorry, I've never been
very good with them.

21:56.933 --> 21:59.172
- Babies?
- Humans.

21:59.173 --> 22:02.492
Moriarty - did he have
any connection with Thatcher?

22:02.493 --> 22:03.772
Any interest in her?

22:03.773 --> 22:05.132
Why on earth would he?

22:05.133 --> 22:07.173
I don't know. You tell me.

22:09.133 --> 22:11.052
In the last year of his life,

22:11.053 --> 22:14.732
James Moriarty was involved with
four political assassinations,

22:14.733 --> 22:17.892
over 70 assorted robberies
and terrorist attacks,

22:17.893 --> 22:20.532
including a chemical weapons
factory in North Korea,

22:20.533 --> 22:22.572
and had latterly shown some interest

22:22.573 --> 22:25.212
in tracking down the Black
Pearl of the Borgias,

22:25.213 --> 22:26.732
which is still missing, by the way,

22:26.733 --> 22:29.572
in case you feel like applying
yourself to something practical.

22:29.573 --> 22:31.373
It's a pearl - get another one.

22:33.573 --> 22:35.733
There's something important about this.

22:37.173 --> 22:38.332
I'm sure.

22:38.333 --> 22:40.652
Maybe it's Moriarty.

22:40.653 --> 22:42.052
Maybe it's not.

22:43.693 --> 22:45.293
But something's coming.

22:47.133 --> 22:49.533
Are you having a premonition,
brother mine?

22:50.973 --> 22:53.052
The world is woven from billions of lives,

22:53.053 --> 22:54.732
every strand crossing every other.

22:54.733 --> 22:57.173
What we call premonition is
just movement of the web.

22:58.333 --> 23:01.572
If you could attenuate to
every strand of quivering data,

23:01.573 --> 23:03.932
the future would be entirely calculable.

23:03.933 --> 23:05.853
As inevitable as mathematics.

23:07.173 --> 23:10.252
Appointment In Samarra. I'm sorry?

23:10.253 --> 23:12.292
The merchant who can't outrun Death.

23:12.293 --> 23:14.692
You always hated that story as a child.

23:14.693 --> 23:17.812
Less keen on predestination back then.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.412
I'm not sure I like it now.

23:19.413 --> 23:21.572
You wrote your own
version, as I remember.

23:21.573 --> 23:23.412
Appointment In Sumatra.

23:23.413 --> 23:27.172
The merchant goes to a different
city and is perfectly fine.

23:27.173 --> 23:28.492
Goodnight, Mycroft.

23:28.493 --> 23:30.572
Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason.

23:30.573 --> 23:32.321
- Keep me informed.
- Of what?

23:32.346 --> 23:33.757
Absolutely no idea.

23:59.493 --> 24:01.252
'Ammo!'

24:15.573 --> 24:17.574
- Oh, hi, Stella.
- Greg.

24:17.599 --> 24:18.837
You, uh...?

24:19.973 --> 24:23.173
- Uh, yeah, he's just got a client, so...
- Right, right, right...

24:24.893 --> 24:27.492
Uh, you see a lot of each other, do you?

24:27.493 --> 24:30.092
It's nothing. I mean
it's nothing serious.

24:30.093 --> 24:31.777
- No, no.
- I just pop round every

24:31.802 --> 24:33.292
now and again for a chat.

24:33.293 --> 24:34.612
Yeah, of course.

24:34.613 --> 24:36.532
I mean he loves a really tricky case.

24:36.533 --> 24:37.733
Yeah, he does!

24:38.695 --> 24:40.492
So what you here for?

24:40.493 --> 24:42.932
Well, Interpol think
the Borgia Pearl trail

24:42.933 --> 24:44.692
leads back to London, so...

24:44.693 --> 24:47.332
The Borgia Pearl?
They still after that, are they?

24:47.333 --> 24:49.052
Yeah.

24:49.053 --> 24:51.332
So, how did you two first meet?

24:51.333 --> 24:54.332
Oh, well, there was a case about,
um, ten years ago.

24:54.333 --> 24:55.452
Nobody could figure it out.

24:55.453 --> 24:57.972
There was an old lady
found dead in a sauna.

24:57.973 --> 25:01.172
- Oh, yeah? How did she die?
- Hypothermia.

25:01.173 --> 25:02.252
What?

25:02.253 --> 25:04.852
I know, but then I met Sherlock,
it was so simple the way...

25:04.853 --> 25:07.252
Will you two please keep it down?!

25:07.253 --> 25:08.412
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

25:08.413 --> 25:10.692
Now, you haven't always been
in life insurance, have you?

25:10.693 --> 25:13.452
You started out in manual labour.
Don't bother being astonished.

25:13.453 --> 25:15.373
Your right hand's almost
an entire size bigger

25:15.398 --> 25:17.212
than your left - hard
manual work does that.

25:17.213 --> 25:19.332
I was a carpenter. Like me dad.

25:19.333 --> 25:21.452
You're trying to give up smoking -
unsuccessfully -

25:21.453 --> 25:22.516
and you once had a Japanese girlfriend

25:22.540 --> 25:25.372
that meant a lot to you but
now you feel indifferent about.

25:25.373 --> 25:26.852
How the hell...?

25:26.853 --> 25:29.572
Ah... e-cigarettes.

25:29.573 --> 25:31.572
Not just that - ten
individual e-cigarettes.

25:31.573 --> 25:33.932
If you just wanted to smoke indoors,
you would've invested

25:33.933 --> 25:36.052
in one of those irritating
electronic pipe things.

25:36.053 --> 25:38.812
But you're convinced you can give up,
so you don't want to buy a pipe,

25:38.813 --> 25:40.612
because that means you're
not serious about quitting.

25:40.636 --> 25:42.221
So instead, you buy individual cigarettes,

25:42.245 --> 25:45.837
always sure that each will be
your last. Anything to add, John?

25:45.862 --> 25:48.532
- John?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, listening.

25:48.533 --> 25:50.932
- What is that?
- That is... me.

25:50.933 --> 25:52.812
Well, it's a me substitute.

25:52.813 --> 25:54.372
Don't be so hard on yourself.

25:54.373 --> 25:56.692
You know I value your
little contributions.

25:56.693 --> 25:58.852
Yeah? It's been there
since nine this morning.

25:58.853 --> 26:01.292
- Has it? Where were you?
- Helping Mrs H with her sudoku.

26:01.293 --> 26:02.435
What about my girlfriend?

26:02.460 --> 26:03.852
- What?
- You said I had an ex...

26:03.853 --> 26:06.092
You've got a Japanese tattoo
in the crook of your elbow

26:06.093 --> 26:07.412
in the name Akako.

26:07.413 --> 26:09.252
It's obvious you've
tried to have it removed.

26:09.253 --> 26:11.212
But surely that means
I want to forget her,

26:11.213 --> 26:12.412
not that I'm indifferent.

26:12.413 --> 26:15.372
If she'd really hurt your feelings,
you would've had the word obliterated.

26:15.373 --> 26:17.213
The first attempt wasn't successful,
and you haven't tried again,

26:17.237 --> 26:18.675
so it seems you can
live with the slightly

26:18.699 --> 26:21.143
blurred memory of Akako,
hence the indifference.

26:23.293 --> 26:25.852
I... I thought you'd
done something clever.

26:25.853 --> 26:29.292
Ah, now, but now you've explained it,
it's dead simple, innit?

26:32.333 --> 26:34.892
I've withheld this information
from you until now, Mr Kingsley,

26:34.893 --> 26:37.292
but I think it's time you knew the truth.

26:37.293 --> 26:38.932
What do you mean?

26:38.933 --> 26:41.652
Have you ever wondered if your wife
was a little bit out of your league?

26:41.653 --> 26:43.692
- Well...
- You thought she was having an affair.

26:43.693 --> 26:45.932
I'm afraid it's far worse than that,
your wife is a spy.

26:45.933 --> 26:46.991
- What?
- That's right.

26:47.016 --> 26:49.052
Her real name is Greta Bengsdotter.

26:49.053 --> 26:51.692
Swedish by birth and probably the
most dangerous spy in the world.

26:51.693 --> 26:54.292
She's been operating deep undercover
for the past four years now

26:54.293 --> 26:56.972
as your wife, for one reason only,
to get near the American Embassy,

26:56.973 --> 26:58.452
across the road from your flat.

26:58.453 --> 27:00.412
Tomorrow the US President
will be at the embassy,

27:00.413 --> 27:01.932
as part of an official state visit.

27:01.933 --> 27:04.452
As the President greets members
of staff, Greta Bengsdotter,

27:04.453 --> 27:07.052
disguised as a 22-stone cleaner,
will inject the President

27:07.053 --> 27:08.972
in the back of the neck
with a dangerous new drug,

27:08.973 --> 27:11.652
hidden inside a secret compartment
inside her padded armpit.

27:11.653 --> 27:14.052
This drug will render the
President entirely susceptible

27:14.077 --> 27:16.350
to the will of that new master,
none other than James Moriarty.

27:16.374 --> 27:16.948
What?

27:16.973 --> 27:18.812
Moriarty will then use
the President as a pawn

27:18.813 --> 27:20.972
to destabilise the United
Nations General Assembly,

27:20.973 --> 27:23.492
which is due to vote on a
nuclear non-proliferation treaty,

27:23.493 --> 27:26.332
tipping the balance in favour of a
first-strike policy against Russia.

27:26.333 --> 27:28.332
This chain of events will
then prove unstoppable,

27:28.333 --> 27:30.172
thus precipitating World War III.

27:30.173 --> 27:32.212
- Are you serious?
- No, of course not.

27:32.213 --> 27:33.972
His wife left him
because his breath stinks

27:33.973 --> 27:35.452
and he likes to wear her lingerie.

27:35.453 --> 27:37.252
I don't!

27:37.253 --> 27:39.253
- Just the bras.
- Get out.

27:41.773 --> 27:44.093
So, what's this all about, then?

27:45.293 --> 27:46.313
- Having fun.
- Fun?

27:46.338 --> 27:47.652
- While I can.
- Mm-hmm.

27:49.493 --> 27:51.212
- Uh, Sherlock...
- Borgia Pearl. Boring. Go!

27:51.213 --> 27:52.413
- But...
- Go!

27:53.893 --> 27:56.133
- This had better be good.
- Oh, I think you'll like it.

27:59.133 --> 28:01.532
That is the bust, isn't it?
The one that was broken.

28:01.533 --> 28:03.772
No, it's another one, different owner.

28:03.773 --> 28:05.052
Different part of town.

28:05.053 --> 28:07.613
You were right, this is a thing.
Something's going on.

28:10.413 --> 28:12.252
What's wrong? I thought you'd be pleased.

28:12.253 --> 28:14.652
- I am pleased.
- You don't look pleased.

28:14.653 --> 28:16.093
This is my game face.

28:17.533 --> 28:18.813
And the game is on.

28:20.093 --> 28:22.412
Another two have been smashed
since the Welsborough one.

28:22.413 --> 28:25.132
- One belonging to Mr Mohandes Hassan.
- Identical busts?

28:25.133 --> 28:27.652
Yeah, and this one to a
Dr Barnicot in Holborn.

28:27.653 --> 28:30.212
Three in total. God knows who'd
want to do something like this.

28:30.213 --> 28:33.252
Yeah, but some people have that
complex, don't they? An idee fixe.

28:33.253 --> 28:35.652
They obsess over one thing
and they can't let it go.

28:35.653 --> 28:36.852
No, no good.

28:36.853 --> 28:39.372
There were other images of
Margaret... Margaret...?

28:39.373 --> 28:40.732
You know who she is.

28:40.733 --> 28:42.532
...Thatcher, present at
the first break-in.

28:42.533 --> 28:45.452
Why would a monomaniac
fixate on just one? Ooh!

28:45.453 --> 28:46.653
- What?
- Blood.

28:47.559 --> 28:48.799
Quite a bit of it, too.

28:50.013 --> 28:52.132
Was there any injury at the crime scene?

28:52.133 --> 28:53.532
Nah.

28:53.533 --> 28:56.252
Then our suspect must have cut
themselves breaking the bust.

28:56.253 --> 28:57.665
- Come on.
- Holborn?

28:57.690 --> 28:58.412
Lambeth!

28:58.413 --> 29:00.172
- Lambeth? Why?
- To see Toby.

29:00.173 --> 29:01.892
Ah, right. Who?

29:01.893 --> 29:03.452
- You'll see.
- Right, are you coming?

29:03.453 --> 29:05.892
No, he's got a lunch date with
a brunette forensic officer

29:05.893 --> 29:07.332
that he doesn't want to be late for.

29:07.333 --> 29:09.132
- Who told you?
- The right sleeve of your jacket,

29:09.133 --> 29:11.012
plus the formaldehyde
mixed with your cologne

29:11.013 --> 29:13.372
and your complete inability
to stop looking at your watch.

29:13.373 --> 29:15.652
- Have a good time.
- I will.

29:15.653 --> 29:17.532
Trust me, though,
she's not right for you.

29:17.533 --> 29:19.852
- What?
- She's not the one.

29:19.853 --> 29:22.292
Well, thank you, Mystic Meg.

29:22.293 --> 29:23.572
How do you work all that out?

29:23.573 --> 29:25.972
She's got three children in
Rio that he doesn't know about.

29:25.973 --> 29:26.942
Are you just making this up?

29:26.966 --> 29:28.468
- Possibly.
- Who's Toby?

29:28.493 --> 29:30.692
There's a kid I know,
hacker, brilliant hacker,

29:30.693 --> 29:31.892
one of the world's best.

29:31.893 --> 29:33.332
Got himself into serious trouble

29:33.333 --> 29:35.092
with the Americans a couple of years ago.

29:35.093 --> 29:36.932
He hacked into the
Pentagon security system,

29:36.933 --> 29:39.372
and I managed to get him off the charge.

29:39.373 --> 29:41.212
Therefore he owes me a favour.

29:41.213 --> 29:42.478
So, how does that help us?

29:42.503 --> 29:44.172
- What?
- Toby the hacker?

29:44.173 --> 29:45.813
- Toby's not the hacker.
- What?

29:46.853 --> 29:49.172
- All right, Craig?
- All right, Sherlock?

29:49.173 --> 29:51.492
Craig's got a dog.

29:51.493 --> 29:52.972
So I see.

29:52.973 --> 29:54.332
Good boy!

29:54.333 --> 29:56.212
Hiya!

29:56.213 --> 29:58.132
Mary? What are you...?

29:58.133 --> 30:00.732
No, we, we agreed we would
never bring Rosie out on a case.

30:00.733 --> 30:03.372
No, exactly. So... don't wait up.

30:03.373 --> 30:04.163
- Hey, Sherlock.
- Hey.

30:04.187 --> 30:05.492
Mary, what are you doing here?

30:05.493 --> 30:06.805
She's better at this than you.

30:06.830 --> 30:08.428
- Better?
- So I texted her.

30:08.453 --> 30:10.172
Hang on, Mary's better than me?

30:10.173 --> 30:13.092
Well, she is a retired super-agent
with a terrifying skill-set.

30:13.093 --> 30:15.972
Of course she's better.
Yeah, OK. Nothing personal.

30:15.973 --> 30:17.892
What, so I'm supposed to
just go home now, am I?

30:17.893 --> 30:20.172
What do you think, Sherlock?
Shall we take him with us?

30:20.173 --> 30:21.470
- John or the dog?
- Ha-ha, that's funny!

30:21.494 --> 30:22.143
- John.
- Well...

30:22.168 --> 30:23.292
He's handy and loyal.

30:23.293 --> 30:26.572
- That's hilarious.
- Is it too early for a divorce?

30:26.573 --> 30:29.612
Oh. Barnicot's house, then.
Anyone up for a trudge?

30:29.613 --> 30:32.452
Keep up, he's fast.

30:32.453 --> 30:34.333
- He's not moving.
- He's thinking.

30:37.333 --> 30:38.932
He's really not moving.

30:38.933 --> 30:41.733
Slow but sure, John,
not dissimilar to yourself.

30:43.053 --> 30:45.372
You just like this dog, don't you?

30:45.373 --> 30:47.653
- Well, I like you.
- He's still not moving.

30:50.493 --> 30:51.813
- Fascinating.
- Oh!

31:13.129 --> 31:14.612
Well, what do you make of it?

31:14.613 --> 31:17.492
- They were looking for something.
- Yes, but it wasn't a burglar,

31:17.493 --> 31:20.333
they came specifically for
that Thatcher bust. Why?

31:47.253 --> 31:48.372
Clever.

31:48.373 --> 31:50.932
Well, if you were wounded and you
knew you were leaving a trail,

31:50.933 --> 31:52.972
- where would you go?
- Like hiding a tree in a forest.

31:52.973 --> 31:54.972
Or blood in a butcher's.

31:54.973 --> 31:58.223
Never mind, Toby,
better luck next time, hmm?

31:58.248 --> 32:00.452
This is it, though.
This is the one, I can feel it.

32:00.453 --> 32:01.692
Not Moriarty?

32:01.693 --> 32:04.972
It has to be him. It's too
bizarre, it's too baroque.

32:04.973 --> 32:07.932
It's designed to beguile me,
tease me and lure me in.

32:07.933 --> 32:11.373
At last, a noose for
me to put my neck into.

32:30.253 --> 32:33.332
You should have seen the
state of the front room.

32:33.333 --> 32:37.092
- It was like The Exorcist.
- Huh. Was Rosie's head spinning round?

32:37.093 --> 32:41.333
- No. Just the projectile vomiting.
- Nice!

32:43.253 --> 32:46.172
Now, you think we'd have noticed,
when she was born.

32:46.173 --> 32:50.892
- Hmm? Noticed what?
- The little 666 on her forehead.

32:50.893 --> 32:52.733
Hmm, that's The Omen.

32:54.653 --> 32:56.932
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.

32:56.933 --> 32:58.172
They're two different things.

32:58.173 --> 33:00.572
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.

33:04.093 --> 33:05.253
Yeah, can't she?

33:07.653 --> 33:11.172
I'm coming, darling. Mummy's coming.

33:11.173 --> 33:13.773
Oh, what are you doing?

33:15.053 --> 33:18.372
What are you doing? Come here.

33:18.373 --> 33:22.213
Have you heard of that thing? In Germany?

33:23.213 --> 33:25.372
You're going to have to be
more specific, Craig.

33:25.373 --> 33:29.332
Ostalgie. People who missed the
old days under the communists.

33:29.333 --> 33:31.652
- People are weird, aren't they?
- Hmm.

33:31.653 --> 33:35.012
According to this, there's quite
a market for Cold War memorabilia.

33:35.013 --> 33:39.012
Thatcher, Reagan, Stalin.
Time's a great leveller, innit?

33:39.013 --> 33:41.772
Thatcher's like, I dunno, Napoleon now.

33:41.773 --> 33:44.492
Yes, fascinating. Irrelevant.
Where exactly did they come from?

33:44.493 --> 33:47.572
I've got into the records of
the suppliers, Gelder and Co.

33:47.573 --> 33:49.332
Seems they're from Georgia.

33:49.333 --> 33:50.732
Where exactly?

33:50.733 --> 33:54.852
Tbilisi. Batch of six.
One to Welsborough. One to Hassan.

33:54.853 --> 33:56.332
One to Dr Barnicot.

33:56.333 --> 33:58.012
Two to Miss Orrie Harker.

33:58.013 --> 34:01.052
One to a Mr Jack Sandeford of Reading.

34:01.053 --> 34:02.332
Lestrade? Another one?

34:02.333 --> 34:05.092
- 'Yeah.'
- Harker or Sandeford?

34:05.093 --> 34:08.212
Harker. And it's murder this time.

34:08.213 --> 34:10.013
Hmm, that perks things up a bit.

34:14.702 --> 34:17.516
_

34:17.690 --> 34:19.902
_

34:20.253 --> 34:24.371
Defensive wounds on her face and
hands, throat cut. Sharp blade.

34:24.373 --> 34:26.411
The same thing inside the house? The bust?

34:26.413 --> 34:28.132
- Two of them this time.
- Interesting.

34:28.132 --> 34:30.732
That batch of statues was made
in Tbilisi several years ago.

34:30.733 --> 34:33.132
- Limited edition of six.
- And now someone's wandering about

34:33.132 --> 34:35.411
destroying them all. Makes
no sense. What's the point?

34:35.413 --> 34:38.012
No, they're not destroying them,
that's not what's happening.

34:38.013 --> 34:39.931
- Yes, it is.
- Well, it is, but it's not the point.

34:39.933 --> 34:41.532
I've been slow, far too slow.

34:41.533 --> 34:44.092
Well, I'm still being slow over here,
so if you wouldn't mind...

34:44.092 --> 34:45.612
Slow but lucky, very lucky.

34:45.612 --> 34:48.891
And since they smashed both busts,
our luck might just hold.

34:48.893 --> 34:51.532
Jack Sandeford of Reading
is where I'm going next.

34:51.533 --> 34:53.331
Congratulations, by the way.

34:53.333 --> 34:55.891
- I'm sorry?
- Well, you're about to solve a big one.

34:55.893 --> 35:00.053
- Yeah, until John publishes his blog.
- Yeah, until then, basically.

35:17.533 --> 35:18.973
That's enough now, love.

35:22.133 --> 35:24.093
Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.

35:25.133 --> 35:28.093
And you need to get to bed. Come on.

36:00.213 --> 36:01.492
Wouldn't it be much simpler

36:01.493 --> 36:03.853
to take out your grievances
at the polling station?

36:22.333 --> 36:26.215
You were on the run. Nowhere
to hide your precious cargo.

36:29.573 --> 36:31.132
You find yourself in a workshop,

36:31.133 --> 36:33.852
plaster busts of the Iron
Lady drying, it's clever.

36:33.853 --> 36:34.892
Very clever.

36:34.893 --> 36:38.052
But now you've met me and
you're not so clever, are you?

36:38.053 --> 36:39.092
Who are you?

36:39.093 --> 36:40.693
My name is Sherlock Holmes.

36:42.133 --> 36:43.653
Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.

36:56.053 --> 36:58.493
Argh!

38:09.133 --> 38:10.692
You're out of time.

38:10.693 --> 38:13.572
- Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.
- Who?

38:13.573 --> 38:16.292
I know it's him. It must be him.

38:16.293 --> 38:18.532
You think you understand.

38:18.533 --> 38:20.532
You understand nothing.

38:20.533 --> 38:22.892
Well, before the police
come in and spoil things,

38:22.893 --> 38:25.572
why don't we just enjoy the moment?

38:25.573 --> 38:28.452
Let me present
Interpol's number one case.

38:28.453 --> 38:30.692
Too tough for them, too boring for me.

38:30.693 --> 38:34.653
The Black Pearl of the Borgias!

38:42.693 --> 38:43.893
It's not possible!

38:45.373 --> 38:46.613
How could she...?!

38:51.493 --> 38:53.212
Everything about who I was is on there.

38:53.213 --> 38:56.452
The problems of your
past are your business.

38:56.453 --> 38:58.333
The problems of your future...

38:59.893 --> 39:01.053
...are my privilege.

39:08.373 --> 39:09.533
I don't understand.

39:10.653 --> 39:12.892
She... She destroyed it.

39:12.893 --> 39:14.373
She?

39:17.853 --> 39:21.532
You know her! You do, don't you?

39:21.533 --> 39:23.213
You know the bitch?!

39:25.007 --> 39:26.327
She betrayed me.

39:27.093 --> 39:28.933
Betrayed us all. Mary.

39:30.333 --> 39:31.692
This is about Mary?

39:31.693 --> 39:33.932
Is that what she's
calling herself now, eh?

39:33.933 --> 39:36.982
- 'Armed police, you're surrounded!'
- Give it to me.

39:38.373 --> 39:39.852
Give it to me!

39:39.853 --> 39:42.372
'Come out slowly, I want to see
your hands above your head.'

39:42.373 --> 39:45.092
Nobody shoots me!
Anyone shoots, I kill this man.

39:45.093 --> 39:48.132
'Lay down your weapon. Do it now!'

39:48.133 --> 39:50.052
I'm leaving this place.

39:50.053 --> 39:52.692
If no-one follows me, no-one dies.

39:52.693 --> 39:54.732
'Lay down your weapon.'

39:54.733 --> 39:57.353
You are a policeman, I'm a professional.

39:58.733 --> 40:01.452
Tell her she's a dead woman.

40:01.453 --> 40:03.052
She's a dead woman walking.

40:03.053 --> 40:07.132
She's my friend.
And she's under my protection.

40:07.133 --> 40:08.592
Who are you?

40:10.213 --> 40:14.413
I'm the man who's going
to kill your friend.

40:16.093 --> 40:17.493
Who's Sherlock Holmes?

40:18.573 --> 40:19.933
Not a policeman.

40:45.093 --> 40:47.493
What do you think? Mate in two?

40:49.613 --> 40:52.452
Don't antagonise them, darling.

40:52.453 --> 40:55.092
Oh, what else is there to do?
Chess palls after three months.

40:55.093 --> 40:56.932
Everything palls.

40:56.933 --> 40:59.252
They'll send someone soon.

40:59.253 --> 41:01.812
They? Who are they?

41:01.813 --> 41:04.812
Seems to me we put an
awful lot of faith in they.

41:04.813 --> 41:06.812
Well, I've got something
they would dearly love,

41:06.813 --> 41:08.613
if only we could get out of here.

41:10.293 --> 41:11.332
I've got Ammo.

41:11.333 --> 41:12.893
Ammo?

41:35.533 --> 41:38.852
- Madame Ambassador.
- What took you so long?

41:38.853 --> 41:41.493
- Can't get the staff.
- Everyone out, now!

41:45.453 --> 41:46.933
Veer left!

41:58.933 --> 42:01.173
What now? What do we do?

42:05.013 --> 42:06.133
We die.

42:19.773 --> 42:21.612
Well?

42:21.613 --> 42:23.852
He can't have got far.
We'll have him in a bit.

42:23.853 --> 42:26.532
- I very much doubt it.
- Why?

42:26.533 --> 42:28.853
Because I think he
used to work with Mary.

43:29.973 --> 43:33.173
Ammo. Ammo. Ammo.

43:37.453 --> 43:41.253
Ammo. Ammo. Ammo.

43:46.053 --> 43:49.612
Passed out again.
It's no fun when they pass out!

43:49.613 --> 43:51.252
We'll come back later.

43:51.253 --> 43:55.372
What would he do if he knew, huh?
About the English woman?

43:55.373 --> 43:57.093
What would you do to a traitor?

43:58.373 --> 44:01.532
Maybe we'll tell him one day.
If he lives that long.

45:17.213 --> 45:20.573
I am an idiot, I know nothing.

45:21.773 --> 45:23.732
Well, I've been telling
you that for ages.

45:23.733 --> 45:25.773
That was quite a text you sent me.

45:27.573 --> 45:28.812
What's going on, Sherlock?

45:28.813 --> 45:30.692
I was so convinced it was Moriarty,

45:30.693 --> 45:33.092
I couldn't see what
was right under my nose.

45:33.093 --> 45:34.373
Expected a pearl.

45:40.453 --> 45:41.812
Oh, my God, that's a...

45:41.813 --> 45:44.932
Yes, it's an AGRA.
Memory stick, like you gave John,

45:44.933 --> 45:46.972
except this one belongs to someone else.

45:46.997 --> 45:47.652
Who?

45:47.653 --> 45:50.652
I don't know. We... We all
had one but the others were...

45:50.653 --> 45:52.548
Haven't you even looked at it yet?

45:52.573 --> 45:53.815
I glanced at it but I prefer

45:53.840 --> 45:55.037
- to hear it from you.
- Why?

45:56.613 --> 45:59.053
Because I'll know the
truth when I hear it.

46:06.093 --> 46:08.892
There were four of us, agents.

46:08.893 --> 46:10.612
Not just agents.

46:10.613 --> 46:13.052
Polite term.

46:13.053 --> 46:15.892
Alex. Gabriel.

46:15.893 --> 46:18.453
Me. And Ajay.

46:20.213 --> 46:24.372
There was absolute trust between us.
The memory sticks guaranteed it.

46:24.373 --> 46:26.492
We all had one.

46:26.493 --> 46:29.732
Each containing aliases,
our background, everything.

46:29.733 --> 46:31.332
We could never be betrayed,

46:31.333 --> 46:34.132
because we had everything we
needed to destroy the other.

46:34.133 --> 46:36.692
- Who employed you?
- Anyone who paid well.

46:36.693 --> 46:39.332
I mean, we were at the
top of our game for years.

46:39.333 --> 46:42.012
And then it all ended.

46:42.013 --> 46:44.412
There was a coup in Georgia.

46:44.413 --> 46:47.132
The British Embassy in Tbilisi
was taken over, lots of hostages.

46:47.133 --> 46:49.532
We got the call to go in, get them out.

46:49.533 --> 46:52.052
There was a change of plan,
a last-minute adjustment.

46:52.053 --> 46:53.876
- Who from?
- I don't know,

46:53.901 --> 46:56.572
just another voice on the phone.

46:56.573 --> 46:58.013
And a codeword.

46:59.333 --> 47:01.252
- Ammo.
- Ammo?

47:01.253 --> 47:03.972
Like ammunition.

47:03.973 --> 47:06.373
We went in, but then
something went wrong.

47:07.413 --> 47:09.133
Something went really wrong.

47:23.333 --> 47:25.732
That was six years ago.

47:25.733 --> 47:27.652
It feels like forever.

47:27.653 --> 47:29.972
I was the only one that made it out.

47:29.973 --> 47:31.452
No.

47:31.453 --> 47:32.612
What?

47:32.613 --> 47:34.093
I met someone tonight.

47:36.293 --> 47:39.253
Same someone who's looking
for the sixth Thatcher.

47:46.653 --> 47:49.252
Oh, my God, that's Ajay, that's him.
What, he's alive?

47:49.253 --> 47:50.653
Yeah, very much so.

47:51.853 --> 47:54.492
I don't believe it, this is amazing!
I thought I was the only one,

47:54.493 --> 47:56.132
I thought I was the only one who got out.

47:56.133 --> 47:57.692
Where is he? I need to see him, now!

47:57.693 --> 48:01.092
Before you gave it to John,
did you keep your memory stick safe?

48:01.093 --> 48:03.812
Yeah, of course. It was our insurance.

48:03.813 --> 48:06.052
Above all, they mustn't
fall into enemy hands.

48:06.053 --> 48:08.372
So Ajay survived as well.

48:08.373 --> 48:11.012
And now he's looking for the
memory stick he managed to hide,

48:11.013 --> 48:14.132
with all of AGRA's old aliases
on it, but why?

48:14.133 --> 48:15.852
I don't know.

48:15.853 --> 48:18.333
Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been?

48:22.853 --> 48:25.932
Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this,
but he wants you dead.

48:28.493 --> 48:32.372
Sorry, no, no, because
we... we were family.

48:32.373 --> 48:33.493
Families fall out.

48:34.693 --> 48:37.572
The memory stick is the
easiest way to track you down.

48:37.573 --> 48:40.092
You're the only other survivor,
it must be you that he wants,

48:40.093 --> 48:42.812
and he's already killed
looking for the Thatcher bust.

48:42.813 --> 48:44.252
Well, he's just trying to find me.

48:44.253 --> 48:45.972
He survived, that's all that matters!

48:45.973 --> 48:47.772
I heard it from his own mouth.

48:47.773 --> 48:49.973
"Tell her she's a dead woman walking."

48:53.213 --> 48:54.813
Why would he want to kill me?

48:56.133 --> 48:59.013
- He said you betrayed him.
- Oh, no, no, that's insane.

49:01.013 --> 49:02.653
Well, it's what he believes.

49:09.773 --> 49:12.372
I suppose I was always
afraid this might happen.

49:12.373 --> 49:15.332
That something in my past would
come back to haunt me one day.

49:15.333 --> 49:17.812
Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.

49:17.813 --> 49:21.012
God, I just wanted a bit of peace,
and I really thought I had it.

49:21.013 --> 49:22.053
No, Mary...

49:23.613 --> 49:24.653
You do.

49:26.373 --> 49:27.693
I made a vow, remember?

49:29.213 --> 49:30.933
To look after the three of you.

49:32.053 --> 49:33.853
Sherlock, the dragon-slayer.

49:35.053 --> 49:38.613
Stay close to me and I will keep
you safe from him, I promise you.

49:40.973 --> 49:43.452
There's something I think you should read.

49:43.453 --> 49:45.252
What is it?

49:45.253 --> 49:47.173
I hoped I wouldn't have to do this.

49:51.493 --> 49:52.533
What are you...?

49:55.893 --> 49:57.772
- Mary... Oh, no!
- There you go.

49:57.773 --> 50:01.693
It's all right.
It's for the best, believe me.

50:03.093 --> 50:04.133
No.

50:06.213 --> 50:09.093
You just look after them till
I get back. I'm sorry.

50:10.093 --> 50:11.133
I'm so sorry.

50:42.093 --> 50:43.612
Agra?

50:43.613 --> 50:45.452
A city on the banks of the river Yamuna

50:45.453 --> 50:47.772
in the northern state of
Uttar Pradesh, India.

50:47.773 --> 50:50.812
It is 378km west of the state
capital, Lucknow.

50:50.813 --> 50:52.692
What are you, Wikipedia?

50:52.693 --> 50:54.612
- Yes.
- AGRA is an acronym.

50:54.613 --> 50:56.332
Oh, good, I love an acronym.

50:56.333 --> 50:58.772
All the best secret societies have them.

50:58.773 --> 51:01.372
Team of agents,
the best. But you know all that.

51:01.373 --> 51:02.892
Of course I do. Go on.

51:02.893 --> 51:06.252
One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary,
also one of the team.

51:06.253 --> 51:08.532
Indeed? Well, that's news to me.

51:08.533 --> 51:11.852
Is it? He's already killed
looking for that memory stick.

51:11.853 --> 51:13.812
AGRA always worked
for the highest bidder,

51:13.813 --> 51:15.172
I thought that might include you?

51:15.173 --> 51:16.892
- Me?
- Well, I mean the British government,

51:16.893 --> 51:19.292
or whatever government
you're currently propping up.

51:19.293 --> 51:23.492
AGRA were very reliable.
Then came the Tbilisi incident.

51:23.493 --> 51:25.772
They were sent in to free the hostages

51:25.773 --> 51:27.852
but it all went horribly wrong.

51:27.853 --> 51:30.252
And that was that,
we stopped using freelancers.

51:30.253 --> 51:32.572
- Your initiative?
- My initiative.

51:32.573 --> 51:36.212
Freelancers are too woolly, too messy.

51:36.213 --> 51:39.439
I don't like loose ends. Not on my watch.

51:42.520 --> 51:45.240
There was something else. A detail.

51:46.213 --> 51:47.253
A codeword.

51:49.773 --> 51:50.812
Ammo?

51:50.813 --> 51:52.132
It's all I've got.

51:52.133 --> 51:53.612
Little enough.

51:53.613 --> 51:55.732
Could you do some digging as a favour?

51:55.733 --> 51:57.972
You don't have many favours left.

51:57.973 --> 51:59.932
Then I'm calling them all in.

51:59.933 --> 52:03.332
And if you can find who's after
her and neutralise them, what then?

52:03.333 --> 52:05.292
You think you can go
on saving her forever?

52:05.293 --> 52:06.492
Of course.

52:06.493 --> 52:08.092
Is that sentiment talking?

52:08.093 --> 52:09.813
No, it's me.

52:10.853 --> 52:13.092
Difficult to tell the
difference these days.

52:13.093 --> 52:16.772
Told you, I made a promise. A vow.

52:16.773 --> 52:19.015
All right. I'll see what I can do.

52:19.853 --> 52:22.212
But remember this, brother mine,

52:22.213 --> 52:25.772
agents like Mary tend not
to reach retirement age.

52:25.773 --> 52:30.533
They get retired in a pretty
permanent sort of way.

52:32.093 --> 52:34.132
Not on my watch.

52:34.133 --> 52:37.264
'My darling, I need to tell you this

52:37.289 --> 52:39.892
because you mustn't
hate me for going away.'

52:39.893 --> 52:43.132
Pardon me,
I can hear a squeaking.

52:43.133 --> 52:46.372
- Can you hear a squeaking?
- No.

52:46.373 --> 52:49.492
Only I watched a documentary
on the Discovery Channel.

52:49.493 --> 52:51.092
Why Planes Fail.

52:51.093 --> 52:53.292
- Did you see it? Oh, truly terrifying.
- Can't say I did.

52:53.293 --> 52:56.812
Swore I would never
fly again, yet hear I am!

52:56.813 --> 52:58.052
Everything OK, madam?

52:58.053 --> 53:01.212
No. No, no, it's not, but then
what's the use in complaining?

53:01.213 --> 53:05.132
I hear a squeaking.
Probably the wing will come off is all.

53:05.133 --> 53:07.932
Everything's fine, I promise you.
Just relax.

53:07.933 --> 53:10.092
Oh, OK. Relax.

53:10.093 --> 53:12.972
She said relax.

53:12.973 --> 53:15.332
Did you have a nice time in London?

53:15.333 --> 53:18.852
It was OK, I guess.
But did somebody hide the sun?

53:18.853 --> 53:22.613
Did you lose it in the war?

53:26.053 --> 53:29.373
'I gave myself permission
to have an ordinary life.

53:30.853 --> 53:32.972
I'm not running, I promise you that,

53:32.973 --> 53:35.852
I just need to do this in my own way.'

53:35.853 --> 53:39.492
Oh, God! I'm... I-I don't feel so good.

53:39.493 --> 53:40.612
Oh, my God!

53:46.333 --> 53:48.692
- Everything OK, madam?
- I think I'm dying.

53:48.693 --> 53:50.812
I don't feel so good.

53:50.813 --> 53:51.852
You're all right.

53:51.853 --> 53:55.492
Oh, you're sweet.
You have a very kind face.

53:55.493 --> 53:56.853
God will smile on you.

54:00.373 --> 54:03.532
'But I don't want you and
Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,

54:03.533 --> 54:05.093
I'm sorry, my love.'

54:17.053 --> 54:20.013
I know you'll try to find
me but there is no point.

54:21.493 --> 54:25.132
Every move is random and not even
Sherlock Holmes can anticipate

54:25.133 --> 54:26.333
the roll of a dice.

54:31.013 --> 54:35.572
I need to move the target far,
far away from you

54:35.573 --> 54:38.333
and Rosie, and then I'll
come back, my darling.

54:39.733 --> 54:41.053
I swear I will.'

56:17.933 --> 56:20.412
Not like this one.

56:20.413 --> 56:22.813
You haven't got a chance, not a chance.

56:24.013 --> 56:27.252
I've got you where I want you.
Give in, give in!

56:27.253 --> 56:32.092
I will destroy you.
You're completely at my mercy.

56:32.093 --> 56:34.292
Mr Baker. Well, that completes the set.

56:34.293 --> 56:36.692
- No, it does not.
- Well, who else am I missing?

56:36.693 --> 56:38.772
Master Bun, it's not a set without him.

56:38.773 --> 56:40.692
How many more times, Mr Sherlock?

56:40.693 --> 56:43.092
Hmm, maybe it's because I'm
not familiar with the concept.

56:43.093 --> 56:44.572
Oh, hi, Mary.

56:44.573 --> 56:45.732
What concept?

56:45.733 --> 56:48.372
Happy families. Nice trip?

56:48.373 --> 56:51.892
- How the f...?
- Please, Mary, there is a child present.

56:51.893 --> 56:54.532
- How did you get in here?
- Karim let me in.

56:54.533 --> 56:56.372
Hello.

56:56.373 --> 56:58.532
Karim, would you be so kind
as to fetch us some tea?

56:58.533 --> 57:00.692
- Sure.
- Thank you.

57:00.693 --> 57:02.133
Nice to meet you, missus.

57:05.493 --> 57:08.332
No, I mean how did you find me?

57:08.333 --> 57:09.852
I'm Sherlock Holmes.

57:09.853 --> 57:11.292
No, really, though, how?

57:11.293 --> 57:13.532
Every movement I made was entirely random,

57:13.533 --> 57:17.012
every new personality just
on the roll of a dice!

57:17.013 --> 57:18.732
Mary, no human action
is ever truly random.

57:18.733 --> 57:20.892
An advanced grasp of the
mathematics of probability,

57:20.893 --> 57:23.692
mapped onto a thorough apprehension
of human psychology and the

57:23.693 --> 57:25.532
known dispositions of
any given individual,

57:25.533 --> 57:27.532
can reduce the number of
variables considerably.

57:27.533 --> 57:29.452
I myself know of at least
58 techniques to refine

57:29.453 --> 57:32.452
a seemingly infinite array of
randomly generated possibilities

57:32.453 --> 57:34.853
down to the smallest number
of feasible variables.

57:35.933 --> 57:37.532
But they're really difficult,

57:37.557 --> 57:40.667
so instead I just stuck a tracer
on the inside of the memory stick.

57:42.013 --> 57:44.092
Oh, you bastard!

57:44.093 --> 57:46.852
- You bastard!
- I know, but your face!

57:46.853 --> 57:48.852
"The mathematics of probability"?

57:48.853 --> 57:51.092
- You believed that.
- "Feasible variables"?

57:51.093 --> 57:53.412
Yes, I started to run out about then.

57:53.413 --> 57:54.852
In the memory stick!

57:54.853 --> 57:56.413
Yeah, that was my idea.

58:07.293 --> 58:09.492
- AGRA?
- Yes.

58:09.493 --> 58:11.693
Uh-huh. You said it was your initials.

58:14.493 --> 58:15.732
In a way that was true.

58:15.733 --> 58:19.173
In a way? So many lies.

58:20.853 --> 58:22.772
I'm so sorry.

58:22.773 --> 58:24.612
And I don't just mean you.

58:24.613 --> 58:26.452
What?

58:26.453 --> 58:29.332
Alex, Gabriel, Ajay...

58:29.333 --> 58:31.933
You're R?

58:34.893 --> 58:35.933
Rosamund?

58:37.373 --> 58:38.973
Rosamund Mary.

58:41.413 --> 58:42.573
I always liked Mary.

58:43.693 --> 58:44.813
Yeah, me too.

58:47.613 --> 58:48.733
I used to.

58:50.253 --> 58:52.012
I just... I didn't know what else to do.

58:52.013 --> 58:53.996
You could have stayed,
you could have talked to me.

58:54.020 --> 58:57.893
That's what couples are supposed
to do. Work things through.

58:59.773 --> 59:00.813
Yes.

59:02.653 --> 59:03.972
Yes, of course.

59:03.973 --> 59:05.853
Mary, I may not be a very good man...

59:07.253 --> 59:09.812
...but I think I'm a bit better
than you give me credit for,

59:09.813 --> 59:11.533
- most of the time.
- All the time.

59:12.933 --> 59:15.492
You're always a good man,
John, I've never doubted that.

59:15.493 --> 59:17.652
You never judge, you never complain.

59:17.653 --> 59:19.533
I don't deserve you, I...

59:22.613 --> 59:26.093
All I ever wanted to do was keep
you and Rosie safe, that's all.

59:30.373 --> 59:32.081
I will keep you safe.

59:35.053 --> 59:36.812
But it has to be in London.

59:36.813 --> 59:38.453
It's my city, I know the turf.

59:40.853 --> 59:44.093
Come home and everything will
be all right, I promise you.

59:45.373 --> 59:46.412
Get down!

59:53.893 --> 59:54.932
Hello again.

59:54.933 --> 59:57.292
- Ajay?
- Oh, you remember me, I'm touched.

59:57.293 --> 01:00:00.212
Look, I thought you were dead,
believe me, I did.

01:00:00.213 --> 01:00:03.292
I've been looking forward to this
for longer than you can imagine.

01:00:03.293 --> 01:00:05.892
I swear to you, I thought you were dead.

01:00:05.893 --> 01:00:09.052
I thought I was the only one who got out.

01:00:09.053 --> 01:00:10.852
How did you find us?

01:00:10.853 --> 01:00:14.332
By following you, Sherlock Holmes.
I mean, you're clever.

01:00:14.333 --> 01:00:17.932
You found her but I found you.
So perhaps not so clever.

01:00:17.933 --> 01:00:21.293
And now here we are. At last.

01:00:24.693 --> 01:00:26.572
Touche!

01:00:26.573 --> 01:00:29.812
Listen, whatever you think you know,
we can talk about this,

01:00:29.813 --> 01:00:30.972
we can work it out.

01:00:30.973 --> 01:00:32.253
She thought I was dead.

01:00:33.613 --> 01:00:35.252
I might as well have been.

01:00:35.253 --> 01:00:38.212
It was always just the four of us,
always, remember?

01:00:38.213 --> 01:00:39.252
Oh, yeah.

01:00:39.253 --> 01:00:40.852
So why do you want to kill me?

01:00:40.853 --> 01:00:44.013
Do you know how long they kept me
prisoner? What they did to me?

01:00:45.053 --> 01:00:46.853
They tortured Alex to death.

01:00:47.973 --> 01:00:51.212
I can still hear the sound of
his back breaking. But you?

01:00:51.213 --> 01:00:52.372
You, where were you?

01:00:52.373 --> 01:00:54.572
That day at the embassy, I escaped.

01:00:54.573 --> 01:00:55.612
Ha!

01:00:55.613 --> 01:00:58.892
But I lost sight of you too, so you
explain. Where were you?

01:00:58.893 --> 01:01:02.212
Oh, I got out. For a while.

01:01:02.213 --> 01:01:04.372
Long enough to hide my memory stick.

01:01:04.373 --> 01:01:06.172
I didn't want that to
fall into their hands.

01:01:06.173 --> 01:01:08.932
I was loyal, you see.

01:01:08.933 --> 01:01:10.693
Loyal to my friends.

01:01:11.693 --> 01:01:15.213
But they took me, tortured me.
Not for information.

01:01:17.333 --> 01:01:19.493
Not for anything except fun.

01:01:21.493 --> 01:01:24.332
They thought I'd give in, die,

01:01:24.333 --> 01:01:25.773
but I didn't, I lived.

01:01:27.213 --> 01:01:30.292
And eventually, they forgot about
me rotting in a cell somewhere.

01:01:30.293 --> 01:01:32.431
Six years they kept me there.

01:01:33.373 --> 01:01:35.220
Until one day I saw my chance.

01:01:36.293 --> 01:01:38.212
Oh, and I made them pay.

01:01:38.213 --> 01:01:42.132
You know, all the time I was there,
I just kept picking up things.

01:01:42.133 --> 01:01:45.812
Little whispers. Laughter. Gossip.

01:01:45.813 --> 01:01:49.092
How the clever agents had been betrayed.

01:01:49.093 --> 01:01:50.772
Brought down by you!

01:01:50.773 --> 01:01:53.053
Me?

01:02:01.133 --> 01:02:03.813
You know I'll kill you too.
You know I will, Ajay.

01:02:05.333 --> 01:02:07.052
What, you think I care if I die?

01:02:07.053 --> 01:02:08.853
I've dreamed of killing you...

01:02:10.533 --> 01:02:13.092
...every night for six years.

01:02:13.093 --> 01:02:17.372
Of squeezing the life out of
your treacherous, lying throat.

01:02:17.373 --> 01:02:19.692
I swear to you, Ajay.

01:02:19.693 --> 01:02:21.652
What did you hear, Ajay?

01:02:21.653 --> 01:02:25.035
When you were a prisoner,
what exactly did you hear?

01:02:27.032 --> 01:02:28.232
What did I hear?

01:02:29.552 --> 01:02:30.592
Ammo.

01:02:32.253 --> 01:02:35.492
Every day as they tore into me, "Ammo.

01:02:35.493 --> 01:02:37.812
Ammo.

01:02:37.813 --> 01:02:40.173
Ammo. Ammo."

01:02:41.653 --> 01:02:43.612
We were betrayed!

01:02:43.613 --> 01:02:45.812
- And they said it was her?
- That you betrayed us!

01:02:45.813 --> 01:02:46.932
They said her name?

01:02:46.933 --> 01:02:49.052
Yeah, they said it was the English woman.

01:02:49.053 --> 01:02:51.893
No! No!

01:02:59.813 --> 01:03:02.532
'The English woman, that's all he heard.

01:03:02.533 --> 01:03:04.412
Naturally, he assumed it was Mary.'

01:03:04.413 --> 01:03:06.292
Couldn't this wait until you're back?

01:03:06.293 --> 01:03:07.372
No, it's not over.

01:03:07.373 --> 01:03:09.172
Ajay said that they'd been betrayed,

01:03:09.173 --> 01:03:11.492
the hostage-takers knew AGRA were coming.

01:03:11.493 --> 01:03:13.332
There was only a voice on the phone.

01:03:13.333 --> 01:03:15.052
'Remember? And a codeword.'

01:03:15.053 --> 01:03:17.172
"Ammo," yes, you said.

01:03:17.173 --> 01:03:19.572
How's your Latin, brother dear?

01:03:19.573 --> 01:03:20.812
My Latin?

01:03:20.813 --> 01:03:23.053
Amo, amas, amat.

01:03:24.293 --> 01:03:26.972
I love, you love, he loves. What...?

01:03:26.973 --> 01:03:30.293
Not "Ammo" as in ammunition,
but "Amo", meaning?

01:03:33.893 --> 01:03:35.813
You'd better be right, Sherlock.

01:03:52.533 --> 01:03:54.053
Bloody thing!

01:03:56.493 --> 01:03:58.012
What's going on?

01:03:58.013 --> 01:03:59.892
I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood,

01:03:59.893 --> 01:04:02.852
your security protocols have
been temporarily rescinded.

01:04:02.853 --> 01:04:03.893
What?

01:04:15.333 --> 01:04:18.373
'So many lies. And I don't just mean you.'

01:04:44.533 --> 01:04:47.132
- Hello.
- Ah, hello.

01:04:47.133 --> 01:04:49.092
- I like your daisy.
- Thank you, yeah.

01:04:49.093 --> 01:04:50.917
It's not really me,
though, I think.

01:04:50.942 --> 01:04:52.692
- No?
- No, no, it's too floral for me.

01:04:52.693 --> 01:04:55.692
I'm more of a "knackered with
weary old eyes" kind of guy.

01:04:55.693 --> 01:04:57.293
Well, I think they're nice.

01:04:59.653 --> 01:05:00.892
Nice eyes.

01:05:00.893 --> 01:05:03.412
- Thank you.
- Look... Look...

01:05:03.413 --> 01:05:04.892
I don't normally do this,

01:05:04.893 --> 01:05:06.692
- but, um...
- But you're going to.

01:05:06.693 --> 01:05:07.813
Yeah.

01:05:11.213 --> 01:05:13.532
- What's this?
- This is me.

01:05:13.533 --> 01:05:17.452
- Thank you. Cheers.
- Yeah. Great.

01:05:17.453 --> 01:05:18.693
- Bye!
- Bye.

01:06:02.245 --> 01:06:05.066
_

01:06:09.330 --> 01:06:11.817
_

01:06:20.413 --> 01:06:22.457
_

01:06:24.053 --> 01:06:26.932
Now, you think we'd have noticed,
when she was born.

01:06:26.933 --> 01:06:28.053
Hmm? Noticed what?

01:06:29.053 --> 01:06:31.613
The little 666 on her forehead.

01:06:33.053 --> 01:06:34.893
Hmm, that's The Omen.

01:06:37.093 --> 01:06:39.172
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.

01:06:39.173 --> 01:06:40.692
They're two different things.

01:06:40.693 --> 01:06:43.492
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.

01:06:46.253 --> 01:06:47.893
- Yeah, can't she?
- Hmm.

01:06:49.253 --> 01:06:51.532
I'm coming darling. I'm coming.

01:06:53.533 --> 01:06:56.172
Oh, what are you doing?

01:06:56.173 --> 01:06:58.292
What are you doing?

01:06:58.293 --> 01:07:00.212
- _
- Come here...

01:07:00.213 --> 01:07:01.893
It's OK.

01:07:01.918 --> 01:07:04.969
_

01:07:05.093 --> 01:07:07.812
- _
- Do you want a cuddle?

01:07:11.184 --> 01:07:13.976
_

01:07:14.253 --> 01:07:16.773
I know.

01:07:20.093 --> 01:07:21.573
- Oh, sweetheart.
- _

01:07:24.654 --> 01:07:26.100
_

01:07:26.293 --> 01:07:29.813
Ssh. Oh, you're not going to
stop crying, are you?

01:07:30.087 --> 01:07:31.388
_

01:07:31.413 --> 01:07:33.972
I know, shall we go and see Daddy?

01:07:33.973 --> 01:07:35.773
Oh, let's go and see Daddy!

01:07:36.773 --> 01:07:39.692
Daddy's here. It's OK, Rosie.

01:07:39.693 --> 01:07:41.052
I'll take her.

01:07:41.053 --> 01:07:43.052
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I may as well get up now.

01:07:43.053 --> 01:07:46.412
Hey, baby, it's Daddy. Your daddy.

01:07:46.413 --> 01:07:49.293
Come here, Rose.
Come here, darling, it's all right.

01:07:51.093 --> 01:07:52.413
Thank you.

01:07:59.270 --> 01:08:07.270
_

01:08:18.487 --> 01:08:21.484
_

01:08:41.933 --> 01:08:45.091
This is absolutely
ridiculous and you know it.

01:08:45.093 --> 01:08:46.772
How many more times?

01:08:46.773 --> 01:08:51.372
Six years ago you held the brief for
Foreign Operations, code name Love.

01:08:51.372 --> 01:08:54.252
And you're basing all
this on a code name?

01:08:54.252 --> 01:08:58.492
On a whispered voice on the telephone?
Come on, Mycroft.

01:08:58.493 --> 01:09:00.572
You were the conduit for AGRA.

01:09:00.573 --> 01:09:03.572
Every assignment,
every detail they got from you.

01:09:03.573 --> 01:09:05.372
It was my job.

01:09:05.372 --> 01:09:07.932
Then there was the Tbilisi incident.
AGRA went in.

01:09:07.933 --> 01:09:09.292
- Yes.
- And they were betrayed.

01:09:09.292 --> 01:09:10.693
Not by me.

01:09:14.093 --> 01:09:16.693
Mycroft, we have known
each other a long time.

01:09:18.693 --> 01:09:19.732
I promise you,

01:09:19.733 --> 01:09:23.131
I haven't the foggiest idea
what all this is about.

01:09:23.133 --> 01:09:27.051
You wound up AGRA and all
the other freelancers.

01:09:27.053 --> 01:09:31.572
I haven't done any of the
things you're accusing me of.

01:09:31.573 --> 01:09:32.733
Not one.

01:09:35.053 --> 01:09:37.332
Not. One.

01:09:53.212 --> 01:09:56.492
Do you think she'll like bedtime stories?
I'd like to do those.

01:09:56.493 --> 01:09:57.532
Yeah?

01:09:57.533 --> 01:10:00.052
Yeah. I just make a series of
gurgling noises at the moment.

01:10:00.053 --> 01:10:02.532
Although she does seem to enjoy them.

01:10:02.533 --> 01:10:04.333
Well, I'll have to give that a go.

01:10:05.613 --> 01:10:06.933
Got a lot to catch up on.

01:10:23.333 --> 01:10:27.293
'You think you understand.
You understand nothing.'

01:10:30.813 --> 01:10:34.532
'Code names Antarctica,
Langdale, Porlock and Love.'

01:10:34.533 --> 01:10:36.772
'You'd be amazed at
what a receptionist picks up.

01:10:36.773 --> 01:10:37.932
'They know everything.'

01:10:37.933 --> 01:10:40.012
'They said it was the English woman.'

01:10:40.013 --> 01:10:41.972
'Don't minute any of this.'

01:10:41.973 --> 01:10:44.253
'They know everything.'

01:10:55.733 --> 01:10:58.413
- You don't make it easy, do you?
- What do you mean?

01:10:59.413 --> 01:11:02.493
Well, being... being so perfect.

01:11:05.573 --> 01:11:09.612
Mary, I... I need to tell you...

01:11:09.613 --> 01:11:12.492
Hang on.

01:11:12.493 --> 01:11:13.733
Can you tell me later?

01:11:15.093 --> 01:11:17.053
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Great.

01:11:18.173 --> 01:11:19.772
Well, no, we can't just go.

01:11:19.773 --> 01:11:20.938
- Rosie.
- Yeah.

01:11:20.963 --> 01:11:21.812
- Er, you go.
- No!

01:11:21.813 --> 01:11:23.932
I'll come as soon as I've found
someone. Mrs Hudson.

01:11:23.933 --> 01:11:25.852
- Corfu till Saturday. Molly?
- Er, yeah, I'll try.

01:11:25.853 --> 01:11:27.572
Well, we should both stay and wait for her.

01:11:27.573 --> 01:11:29.012
You know that's not going to happen.

01:11:29.013 --> 01:11:30.852
If there's more to this case,
you need to see it.

01:11:30.853 --> 01:11:32.013
Yeah, OK, you win.

01:11:46.373 --> 01:11:51.332
'Ladies and gentlemen, the aquarium
will be closing in five minutes.

01:11:51.333 --> 01:11:54.413
'Please make your way to
the exit. Thank you.'

01:12:05.773 --> 01:12:08.452
Your office said I'd find you here.

01:12:08.453 --> 01:12:11.493
This was always my favourite
spot for agents to meet.

01:12:13.533 --> 01:12:16.332
We're like them.

01:12:16.333 --> 01:12:18.852
Ghostly, living in the shadows.

01:12:18.853 --> 01:12:20.492
Predatory?

01:12:20.493 --> 01:12:23.412
Well, it depends which side you're on.

01:12:23.413 --> 01:12:26.092
Also, we have to keep moving or we die.

01:12:26.093 --> 01:12:27.652
Nice location for the final act,

01:12:27.653 --> 01:12:29.612
couldn't have chosen it better myself.

01:12:29.613 --> 01:12:31.692
But then I never could resist
a touch of the dramatic.

01:12:31.693 --> 01:12:33.453
I just come here to look at the fish.

01:12:35.506 --> 01:12:37.066
I knew this would happen one day.

01:12:39.173 --> 01:12:41.452
- It's like that old story.
- I really am a very busy man.

01:12:41.453 --> 01:12:43.092
Would you mind cutting to the chase?

01:12:43.093 --> 01:12:44.812
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?

01:12:44.813 --> 01:12:46.292
With good reason.

01:12:46.293 --> 01:12:50.453
"There was once a merchant,
in a famous market in Baghdad."

01:12:51.973 --> 01:12:54.092
I really have never liked this story.

01:12:54.093 --> 01:12:56.372
I'm just like the merchant in the story,

01:12:56.373 --> 01:12:59.092
I thought I could out-run the inevitable.

01:12:59.093 --> 01:13:01.372
I've always been looking over my shoulder,

01:13:01.373 --> 01:13:04.012
always expecting to see
the grim figure of...

01:13:04.037 --> 01:13:04.892
Death.

01:13:04.893 --> 01:13:05.923
- Hello, Mary.
- Hey.

01:13:05.948 --> 01:13:07.037
- John?
- On his way.

01:13:08.133 --> 01:13:09.573
Let me introduce Ammo.

01:13:10.773 --> 01:13:11.893
You were Ammo?

01:13:13.013 --> 01:13:15.052
You were the person
on the phone that time?

01:13:15.053 --> 01:13:17.532
Using AGRA as her private
assassination unit.

01:13:17.533 --> 01:13:19.372
Why did you betray us?

01:13:19.373 --> 01:13:20.892
Why does anyone do anything?

01:13:20.893 --> 01:13:23.012
- Hmm.
- Let me guess, selling secrets?

01:13:23.013 --> 01:13:25.333
Well, it would be churlish to refuse.

01:13:26.373 --> 01:13:27.972
Worked very well for a few years.

01:13:27.973 --> 01:13:30.292
I bought a nice cottage in
Cornwall on the back of it.

01:13:30.293 --> 01:13:32.572
But...

01:13:32.573 --> 01:13:36.652
The ambassador in Tbilisi found out.
I thought I'd had it.

01:13:36.653 --> 01:13:39.932
Then she was taken hostage in that coup.

01:13:39.933 --> 01:13:42.412
I couldn't believe my luck!

01:13:42.413 --> 01:13:43.972
That bought me a little time.

01:13:43.973 --> 01:13:46.212
But then you found out
your boss had sent AGRA in.

01:13:46.213 --> 01:13:49.212
Very handy. They were
always such reliable killers.

01:13:49.213 --> 01:13:50.892
What you didn't know, Mary,

01:13:50.893 --> 01:13:54.212
was that this one also tipped
off the hostage-takers.

01:13:54.213 --> 01:13:56.612
Lady Smallwood gave the order.

01:13:56.613 --> 01:13:59.492
But I sent another one to the terrorists,

01:13:59.493 --> 01:14:02.172
with a nice little clue
about her code name,

01:14:02.173 --> 01:14:05.092
should anyone have an enquiring mind.

01:14:05.093 --> 01:14:06.892
Seemed to do the trick.

01:14:06.893 --> 01:14:09.012
And you thought your troubles were over.

01:14:09.013 --> 01:14:11.452
I was tired.

01:14:11.453 --> 01:14:13.573
Tired of the mess of it all.

01:14:15.573 --> 01:14:18.773
I just wanted some peace, some clarity.

01:14:20.653 --> 01:14:22.132
The hostages were killed.

01:14:22.133 --> 01:14:24.532
AGRA too.

01:14:24.533 --> 01:14:26.732
Or so I thought.

01:14:26.733 --> 01:14:28.173
My secret was safe.

01:14:29.813 --> 01:14:31.413
But... apparently not.

01:14:33.333 --> 01:14:35.173
Just a little peace.

01:14:36.413 --> 01:14:38.732
That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?

01:14:38.733 --> 01:14:41.972
A family? Home?

01:14:41.973 --> 01:14:43.293
Really, I understand.

01:14:46.013 --> 01:14:49.812
So, just let me get out of here, right?

01:14:49.813 --> 01:14:51.612
Let me just walk away.

01:14:51.613 --> 01:14:54.173
I'll vanish, I'll go forever.

01:14:56.613 --> 01:14:57.652
What do you say?

01:14:57.653 --> 01:14:59.372
After what you did?!

01:14:59.373 --> 01:15:00.413
Mary, no!

01:15:01.773 --> 01:15:02.853
OK.

01:15:05.573 --> 01:15:08.373
London Aquarium. Yes, now.

01:15:11.213 --> 01:15:12.932
I was never a field agent.

01:15:12.933 --> 01:15:15.332
I always thought I'd be rather good.

01:15:16.813 --> 01:15:19.572
Well, you handled the
operation in Tbilisi very well.

01:15:19.573 --> 01:15:20.852
Thanks.

01:15:20.853 --> 01:15:22.532
- For a secretary.
- What?

01:15:22.533 --> 01:15:24.932
It can't have been easy all those
years, sitting in the back,

01:15:24.933 --> 01:15:27.372
keeping your mouth shut when
you knew you were cleverer than

01:15:27.373 --> 01:15:28.572
most of the people in the room.

01:15:28.573 --> 01:15:31.790
- I didn't do this out of jealousy.
- No?

01:15:33.013 --> 01:15:35.932
Same old drudge, day in, day out.

01:15:35.933 --> 01:15:39.052
Never getting out there
where all the excitement was.

01:15:39.053 --> 01:15:42.252
Just back to your little
flat on Wigmore Street.

01:15:42.253 --> 01:15:45.532
They've taken up the pavement
outside the post office there.

01:15:45.533 --> 01:15:47.692
The local clay on your
shoes is very distinctive.

01:15:47.693 --> 01:15:49.238
Yes, your little flat.

01:15:49.263 --> 01:15:50.172
- How do you know?
- Well, on your salary,

01:15:50.173 --> 01:15:51.292
it would have to be modest,

01:15:51.293 --> 01:15:53.612
and you spent all the money on
that cottage, didn't you?

01:15:53.613 --> 01:15:55.492
And what are you, widowed or divorced?

01:15:55.493 --> 01:15:57.852
Wedding ring is at least 30
years old and you've moved it

01:15:57.853 --> 01:16:00.812
to another finger. That means
you're sentimentally attached to it,

01:16:00.813 --> 01:16:02.052
but you're not still married.

01:16:02.053 --> 01:16:04.772
I favour widowed, given the number
of cats you share your life with.

01:16:04.773 --> 01:16:06.732
- Sherlock...
- Two Burmese and a Tortoiseshell,

01:16:06.733 --> 01:16:08.532
judging by the cat
hairs on your cardigan.

01:16:08.533 --> 01:16:10.692
A divorcee is more likely
to look for a new partner,

01:16:10.693 --> 01:16:13.132
a widow to fill the void
left by her dead husband.

01:16:13.133 --> 01:16:15.492
- Sherlock, don't.
- Pets do that, or so I'm told.

01:16:15.493 --> 01:16:17.132
There's clearly no-one new in your life,

01:16:17.133 --> 01:16:19.732
or you wouldn't be spending your
Friday nights in an aquarium.

01:16:19.733 --> 01:16:21.372
That accounts for the drink problem too,

01:16:21.373 --> 01:16:22.692
the slight tremor in your hand,

01:16:22.693 --> 01:16:24.332
the red wine stain ghosting your top lip.

01:16:24.333 --> 01:16:28.133
So, yes, I'd say jealousy
was your motive after all.

01:16:29.773 --> 01:16:31.213
To prove how good you are.

01:16:32.253 --> 01:16:35.613
To make up for the inadequacies
of your... little life.

01:16:37.093 --> 01:16:39.052
Well, Mrs Norbury,

01:16:39.053 --> 01:16:40.932
I must admit this is unexpected.

01:16:40.933 --> 01:16:43.092
Vivian Norbury,

01:16:43.093 --> 01:16:45.972
who out-smarted them all.

01:16:45.973 --> 01:16:47.973
All except Sherlock Holmes.

01:16:51.453 --> 01:16:52.573
There's no way out.

01:16:54.373 --> 01:16:55.693
So it would seem.

01:16:57.573 --> 01:16:59.532
You've seen right through me, Mr Holmes.

01:16:59.533 --> 01:17:00.573
It's what I do.

01:17:02.573 --> 01:17:05.372
Maybe I can still surprise you.

01:17:05.373 --> 01:17:07.533
Now, come on, be sensible.

01:17:09.333 --> 01:17:10.853
Hmm, no, I don't think so.

01:17:22.493 --> 01:17:24.892
Ah! Surprise!

01:17:29.893 --> 01:17:32.172
Everything's fine. It's going to be OK.

01:17:32.173 --> 01:17:34.332
Get an ambulance!

01:17:34.357 --> 01:17:35.505
It's all right, it's all right.

01:17:35.506 --> 01:17:37.132
- Mary!
- John.

01:17:37.133 --> 01:17:41.292
All right, Mary? Mary?
Stay with me, stay with me.

01:17:41.293 --> 01:17:43.132
- Oh, come on...
- No, don't worry.

01:17:43.133 --> 01:17:45.492
Come on, Doctor,
you can do better than that.

01:17:45.493 --> 01:17:46.652
Come on, Mary. Mary?

01:17:46.653 --> 01:17:48.572
Oh, God. John, I think this is it.

01:17:48.573 --> 01:17:50.012
No, no, no, no. It's not.

01:17:50.013 --> 01:17:52.732
- That's...
- You made me so happy.

01:17:52.733 --> 01:17:56.852
You gave me everything I could ever,
ever have wanted...

01:17:56.853 --> 01:17:59.492
Ssh, ssh, Mary, Mary, ssh, ssh.

01:17:59.493 --> 01:18:01.372
- Look after Rosie.
- Ssh, ssh, ssh.

01:18:01.373 --> 01:18:02.624
- Promise me.
- I promise.

01:18:02.649 --> 01:18:03.932
- No...
- Yes, I promise.

01:18:03.933 --> 01:18:07.852
- Promise me!
- I promise, I promise. Ssh, ssh.

01:18:07.853 --> 01:18:09.372
Hey, Sherlock.

01:18:09.373 --> 01:18:10.412
Yes.

01:18:10.413 --> 01:18:11.812
I...

01:18:11.813 --> 01:18:14.412
so like you.

01:18:14.413 --> 01:18:15.813
Did I ever say?

01:18:17.133 --> 01:18:19.372
Yes, yes, you did.

01:18:19.373 --> 01:18:24.813
I'm sorry for... for shooting
you that time. I'm really sorry.

01:18:26.253 --> 01:18:28.892
It's all right. I think we're even now, OK?

01:18:28.893 --> 01:18:30.412
OK.

01:18:30.413 --> 01:18:32.452
- Oh, I think we're...
- Mary, Mary...

01:18:32.453 --> 01:18:35.493
- ...even, definitely even.
- Ssh, ssh.

01:18:38.490 --> 01:18:41.010
You were my whole world.

01:18:45.373 --> 01:18:48.093
Being Mary Watson...

01:18:49.133 --> 01:18:53.532
...was the only life worth living.

01:18:53.533 --> 01:18:55.290
- Mary...
- Thank you.

01:18:58.533 --> 01:18:59.853
Mary...

01:19:37.253 --> 01:19:39.373
Don't you dare!

01:19:41.973 --> 01:19:43.893
You made a vow.

01:19:46.973 --> 01:19:48.093
You swore it.

01:21:15.533 --> 01:21:18.973
'You've been having
dreams. A recurring dream?'

01:21:27.933 --> 01:21:29.533
Do you want to talk about it?

01:21:39.013 --> 01:21:40.973
This is a two-way relationship, you know.

01:21:51.613 --> 01:21:54.852
The whole world has come
crashing down around you.

01:21:54.853 --> 01:21:56.812
Everything's hopeless.

01:21:56.813 --> 01:21:57.853
Irretrievable.

01:21:59.933 --> 01:22:01.813
I know that's what you must feel...

01:22:03.053 --> 01:22:06.732
...but I can only help you if you
completely open yourself up to me.

01:22:06.733 --> 01:22:08.733
That's not really my style.

01:22:15.693 --> 01:22:17.093
I need to know what to do.

01:22:18.933 --> 01:22:19.973
Do?

01:22:21.293 --> 01:22:22.333
About John.

01:23:10.253 --> 01:23:13.893
Put me through to Sherrinford,
please. Yes, I'll wait.

01:23:21.893 --> 01:23:24.212
But nothing will ever
be the same again, will it?

01:23:24.213 --> 01:23:26.092
I'm afraid it won't.

01:23:26.093 --> 01:23:29.412
We'll have to rally round,
I expect, do our bit.

01:23:29.413 --> 01:23:31.253
Look after little Rosie.

01:23:32.293 --> 01:23:33.453
I'm just going to, um...

01:23:35.373 --> 01:23:37.932
...look through these things.
There might be a case.

01:23:37.933 --> 01:23:41.853
A case? Oh, you're not up to it, are you?

01:23:43.493 --> 01:23:46.252
Work is the best antidote
to sorrow, Mrs Hudson.

01:23:46.253 --> 01:23:49.492
Yes. Yes, I expect you're right.

01:23:49.493 --> 01:23:51.532
I'll make some tea, shall I?

01:23:51.533 --> 01:23:53.213
- Mrs Hudson?
- Yes, Sherlock?

01:23:56.013 --> 01:23:59.772
If you ever think I'm
becoming a bit full of myself,

01:23:59.773 --> 01:24:02.652
cocky or over-confident...

01:24:02.653 --> 01:24:04.250
- Yes?
- ...would you just say the

01:24:04.275 --> 01:24:06.012
word Norbury to me? Would you?

01:24:06.013 --> 01:24:07.932
Norbury?

01:24:07.933 --> 01:24:08.973
Just that.

01:24:10.973 --> 01:24:12.213
I'd be very grateful.

01:24:17.293 --> 01:24:18.332
What's this?

01:24:18.333 --> 01:24:21.293
Oh, I brought that up.
It was mixed up with my things.

01:24:26.173 --> 01:24:28.092
Oh, God! Is that...?

01:24:28.093 --> 01:24:29.853
- Must be.
- Oh.

01:24:31.013 --> 01:24:32.972
I knew it wouldn't end like this.

01:24:32.973 --> 01:24:35.493
I knew Moriarty made plans.

01:24:38.133 --> 01:24:41.412
'I thought that would get your attention.

01:24:41.413 --> 01:24:43.413
So, this is in case...

01:24:46.173 --> 01:24:48.332
In case the day comes.

01:24:48.333 --> 01:24:52.613
If you are watching this,
I'm probably dead.

01:24:53.733 --> 01:24:55.692
I hope I can have an
ordinary life but who knows?

01:24:55.693 --> 01:24:58.812
Nothing's certain, nothing's written.

01:24:58.813 --> 01:25:00.813
My old life...

01:25:03.253 --> 01:25:05.013
...it was full of consequences.

01:25:07.853 --> 01:25:10.972
The danger was the fun part but
you can't outrun that forever.

01:25:10.973 --> 01:25:13.693
You need to remember that. So...

01:25:16.373 --> 01:25:20.413
...I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.

01:25:22.613 --> 01:25:24.933
Might be the hardest case of your career.

01:25:26.053 --> 01:25:29.973
When I'm... gone, if I'm gone...

01:25:32.973 --> 01:25:34.853
...I need you to do something for me.'

01:25:43.493 --> 01:25:46.133
Hi.

01:25:47.653 --> 01:25:50.853
I just wondered how
things were going and...

01:25:52.213 --> 01:25:54.213
...if there was anything I could do.

01:25:57.213 --> 01:25:59.613
It's, er, it's from John.

01:26:00.853 --> 01:26:03.253
- Right.
- You don't need to read it now.

01:26:05.733 --> 01:26:07.052
I'm sorry, Sherlock.

01:26:07.053 --> 01:26:12.692
He says... John said if you were
to come round asking after him,

01:26:12.693 --> 01:26:13.853
offering to help...

01:26:15.773 --> 01:26:17.572
Yes?

01:26:17.573 --> 01:26:19.733
He said he'd...

01:26:21.213 --> 01:26:23.333
...that he'd rather have anyone but you.

01:26:25.253 --> 01:26:26.293
Anyone.

01:26:41.133 --> 01:26:44.973
'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.

01:26:48.613 --> 01:26:52.293
When I'm gone, if I'm... gone...

01:26:54.213 --> 01:26:56.613
...I need you to do something for me.

01:26:59.933 --> 01:27:02.053
Save John Watson.

01:27:04.893 --> 01:27:07.253
Save him, Sherlock.

01:27:09.613 --> 01:27:10.973
Save him.'

01:27:17.333 --> 01:27:20.573
'When does the path we walk
on lock around our feet?

01:27:24.573 --> 01:27:28.733
When does the road become a
river with only one destination?'

01:27:31.493 --> 01:27:35.852
'Death waits for us all in Samarra.

01:27:35.853 --> 01:27:38.053
But can Samarra be avoided?'
