00:09.468 --> 00:11.011
Okay, you guys

00:11.012 --> 00:12.553
are all tied up.

00:12.554 --> 00:13.680
(GASPS) Jorge,

00:13.681 --> 00:14.806
there's a snake

00:12.554 --> 00:14.805
on your foot.

00:14.806 --> 00:15.807
What?

00:17.684 --> 00:19.645
- Sometimes,
- it's just too easy.

00:21.188 --> 00:22.814
- Where's Lou
- with the mail?

00:22.817 --> 00:24.358
- Why do you
- want the mail?

00:24.361 --> 00:25.568
Every week, you get

00:25.569 --> 00:26.777
the same postcard

00:24.358 --> 00:26.776
from your mother

00:26.777 --> 00:28.591
that says,

00:28.592 --> 00:30.404
"Don't disappoint me."

00:30.405 --> 00:32.679
We're expecting a package

00:32.680 --> 00:34.952
from the world famous horror

00:30.405 --> 00:34.951
novelist Stephanie Queen.

00:34.952 --> 00:36.412
Why is a famous author

00:36.413 --> 00:37.870
sending you two stuff?

00:37.871 --> 00:39.102
I'd guess you're starting

00:39.103 --> 00:40.331
a book club, but you know...

00:40.332 --> 00:42.917
Jorge.

00:42.918 --> 00:45.191
Actually, we both

00:45.192 --> 00:47.464
entered her annual

00:42.918 --> 00:47.463
scary short story contest.

00:47.464 --> 00:49.007
My story was called,

00:49.008 --> 00:50.549
Labyrinth of the Mind:

00:50.550 --> 00:52.365
One Girl's Terrifying Journey

00:52.366 --> 00:54.178
into the Madness of Her Soul.

00:54.179 --> 00:55.494
Well, that would win for

00:55.495 --> 00:56.807
"Most Boring Title Ever."

00:58.308 --> 00:59.539
What was yours called

00:59.540 --> 01:00.769
Fart of Darkness?

01:02.271 --> 01:03.793
No, it was called

01:03.794 --> 01:05.313
Blood Bags!

01:05.315 --> 01:06.817
And it was about

01:06.818 --> 01:08.317
bags of blood.

01:08.318 --> 01:09.778
- Jorge! Tiffany!
- Guess what?

01:09.781 --> 01:10.947
You got a package

01:10.948 --> 01:12.113
from Stephanie Queen!

01:12.114 --> 01:14.012
I loved her book,

01:14.013 --> 01:15.909
The Crowded Coffin.

01:12.114 --> 01:15.908
JORGE: Me too!

01:15.909 --> 01:17.557
It proved you could fit

01:17.558 --> 01:19.203
20 bodies in one coffin,

01:19.204 --> 01:20.872
- if you cut them up
- the right way.

01:22.749 --> 01:24.126
Anyway, the winner gets

01:24.127 --> 01:25.501
to bring three friends

01:25.502 --> 01:26.754
to meet Stephanie Queen

01:26.755 --> 01:28.004
at her summer cabin.

01:28.005 --> 01:29.339
- So open up
- the package!

01:30.966 --> 01:32.842
This is for Tiffany.

01:32.843 --> 01:35.261
And this is for Jorge.

01:35.262 --> 01:36.326

to some professional writer

01:47.566 --> 01:51.110

01:51.111 --> 01:52.821

03:06.250 --> 03:08.062
that bird joke book.

Really? Because I thought

03:09.962 --> 03:11.857
it was eggs-cellent.

03:11.858 --> 03:13.652
- (LAUGHS) Okay, that was
- not even in the book.

03:13.655 --> 03:15.028
I was just riffing.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.030
Oy.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.032
I think the birdhouse

03:19.033 --> 03:20.033
should face the lake.

03:20.034 --> 03:21.660
- That way, after
- a long day of flying,

03:21.663 --> 03:22.849

03:22.850 --> 03:24.036
the view of the setting sun.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.704
Emma, they are birds.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.207
Not an elderly couple

03:27.208 --> 03:28.707
enjoying their retirement.

03:28.708 --> 03:30.710
And studies have shown

03:30.711 --> 03:32.712
birdhouses facing east

03:28.708 --> 03:32.711
hatch more young.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.547
But that faces the mess hall.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.008
Seeing campers eat eggs

03:36.009 --> 03:37.467
is not going to get them

03:34.548 --> 03:37.467
in the mood to lay any.

03:38.844 --> 03:40.138
Please, what do you

03:40.139 --> 03:41.429
know about birds?

03:41.430 --> 03:43.014
- I know they make
- a terrible sound

03:43.017 --> 03:44.858
- When they hit the windows
- of our penthouse.

03:45.517 --> 03:47.269
- Are you still hanging
- that birdhouse?

03:47.272 --> 03:48.894
By the time you're done,

03:48.895 --> 03:50.168
the birds will have

03:50.169 --> 03:51.440
flown south to their

03:48.895 --> 03:51.439
condos in Miami.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.358
- Ravi and I can't
- agree on anything.

03:53.361 --> 03:54.527
He keeps shooting

03:54.528 --> 03:55.693
down my ideas.

03:55.694 --> 03:57.989
Because they are all nuttier

03:57.990 --> 04:00.282
than a chipmunk's cheeks

03:55.694 --> 04:00.281
at a cashew convention.

04:00.282 --> 04:01.908
- Well, let's each
- make our case,

04:01.911 --> 04:03.056
And let Xander

04:03.057 --> 04:04.202
decide which way

04:01.908 --> 04:04.201
the birdhouse should go.

04:04.202 --> 04:05.663
No way. Xander is

04:05.664 --> 04:07.121
your boyfriend.

04:07.122 --> 04:08.770
He will not side against

04:08.771 --> 04:10.417

04:07.122 --> 04:10.416
all those sweet smooches.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.002
(MIMICS SMOOCHES)

04:13.920 --> 04:14.984

04:14.985 --> 04:16.047
why you've never

04:13.920 --> 04:16.047
had a second date.

04:17.841 --> 04:19.427
Okay, when I'm trying

04:19.428 --> 04:21.011
to resolve issues

04:17.841 --> 04:21.010
with other counselors,

04:21.011 --> 04:22.451
I find it's best to

04:22.452 --> 04:23.889
start with a hug and...

04:21.011 --> 04:23.889
Zip it, hippie!

04:25.599 --> 04:27.267
Emma, it should

04:27.268 --> 04:28.934
face this way!

04:28.935 --> 04:30.311
No!

04:30.312 --> 04:32.563
(BOTH GRUNTING)

04:32.564 --> 04:33.858
You really want

04:33.859 --> 04:35.150
to play tug of war

04:32.564 --> 04:35.150
with me, noodle arms?

04:35.817 --> 04:36.984
Guys, careful!

04:36.985 --> 04:37.986
(BOTH YELL)

04:39.905 --> 04:41.469
That would have hurt

04:41.470 --> 04:43.033
a lot less if you'd let me

04:39.905 --> 04:43.033
put in wall-to-wall carpeting!

04:45.869 --> 04:47.537
- Thanks again for
- inviting us, Jorge.

04:47.540 --> 04:48.789
I can't believe

04:48.790 --> 04:50.040
we actually get to

04:47.537 --> 04:50.039
meet Stephanie Queen.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.750
I can't believe

04:51.751 --> 04:53.459
Jorge took a shower.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.838
Hey, meeting a famous

04:55.839 --> 04:58.215
person is one of my top

04:53.460 --> 04:58.214
three reasons to bathe.

04:58.215 --> 05:00.238
Number one is when

05:00.239 --> 05:02.260
I get a bad case

04:58.215 --> 05:02.259
of the number twos.

05:02.260 --> 05:04.054
- No wonder you
- beat me, Jorge.

05:04.057 --> 05:05.222
You paint such

05:05.223 --> 05:06.389
beautiful word pictures.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.770
Uh, guys,

05:11.771 --> 05:13.729
I think we're here.

05:13.730 --> 05:14.878
Ooh, I hope

05:14.879 --> 05:16.024
she's serving

05:13.730 --> 05:16.024
puh-sketti!

05:17.818 --> 05:19.507
Wow! I guess

05:19.508 --> 05:21.196
she hasn't sold as many

05:17.818 --> 05:21.196
books as we thought.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.115
- Yeah, I've heard
- of a fixer-upper,

05:24.118 --> 05:25.367
But this is

05:25.368 --> 05:26.617
a burner-downer.

05:26.618 --> 05:28.161
- I think
- it's awesome.

05:28.164 --> 05:29.184
And I bet she has

05:29.185 --> 05:30.205
a really spooky doorbell.

05:31.206 --> 05:32.666
(DOORBELL RINGING)

05:33.500 --> 05:34.501

05:36.963 --> 05:38.003

I do that to everyone

05:39.028 --> 05:40.047
who comes to my door.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.197

05:42.198 --> 05:44.344
why the pizza guy won't

05:40.048 --> 05:44.343
deliver here anymore.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.887
I just saw my whole life

05:45.888 --> 05:47.429
flash before my eyes.

05:47.430 --> 05:48.536
I have spent

05:48.537 --> 05:49.641
way too much

05:47.430 --> 05:49.641
time around cows.

05:50.934 --> 05:52.351
Please, come in.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.084
But first, empty all

05:54.085 --> 05:55.814
of your pocket change

05:52.352 --> 05:55.814
into this jar.

05:57.732 --> 05:58.901
Uh, you have

05:58.902 --> 06:00.067
a metal detector?

06:00.068 --> 06:01.528
No, I need laundry money.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.888
Watch that board,

06:06.889 --> 06:08.410
there's a loose screw there.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.601
That board's not

06:11.602 --> 06:12.998
the only thing

06:10.203 --> 06:12.998
with a screw loose.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.627
Thanks to all of your arguing,

06:17.628 --> 06:19.170
we have to start this

06:16.084 --> 06:19.169
project all over again.

06:19.170 --> 06:21.736
How can I not argue with

06:21.737 --> 06:24.301
someone who wishes to put

06:19.170 --> 06:24.300
a bidet in a birdhouse?

06:24.301 --> 06:26.344
It's for European swallows!

06:28.179 --> 06:29.994
Fine!

06:29.995 --> 06:31.807
Xander, bidet or no bidet?

06:31.808 --> 06:32.997
Well...

06:32.998 --> 06:34.185
Before you finish

06:31.808 --> 06:34.184
that sentence, honey,

06:34.185 --> 06:35.750
you should know,

06:35.751 --> 06:37.314
I might be free to "chat"

06:34.185 --> 06:37.313
at the "spot" tonight.

06:37.314 --> 06:39.232
- Every bird deserves
- a butt washer.

06:40.317 --> 06:42.818
Dude, I am your CIT!

06:43.946 --> 06:45.070
to pals before gals?

06:45.071 --> 06:46.573
- (SCOFFS) You know who
- came up with that saying?

06:46.576 --> 06:49.074
A guy with no girlfriend.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.828
Xander, bro,

06:50.829 --> 06:52.578
tell her I am right.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.373
Xander, sweetie,

06:54.374 --> 06:56.165
tell him I'm right.

06:56.166 --> 06:58.001
Uh... Okay,

06:58.002 --> 06:59.836
I hear what both

06:56.166 --> 06:59.835
of you are saying.

06:59.836 --> 07:02.129
And my decision is...

07:02.130 --> 07:03.715
To go for a swim.

07:07.636 --> 07:08.700
Would you like to see

07:08.701 --> 07:09.762
my Spookelton Award?

07:09.763 --> 07:11.452
I won it for my novel,

07:11.453 --> 07:13.141
Hard Hammers, Soft Faces.

07:14.225 --> 07:15.790
Which had the best

07:15.791 --> 07:17.353
catch phrase ever.

07:17.354 --> 07:18.751
BOTH: "Nailed it!"

07:18.752 --> 07:20.147
(LAUGHING)

07:20.148 --> 07:21.171
That book is

07:21.172 --> 07:22.191
not overrated!

07:22.192 --> 07:24.352
- You're just jealous because
- you didn't think of it.

07:25.528 --> 07:26.676
Is she talking

07:26.677 --> 07:27.821
to that moose?

07:27.822 --> 07:29.616
- If it talks back,
- I'm out of here.

07:31.326 --> 07:33.203
Hey, is this a toaster?

07:34.204 --> 07:36.289
No, that's Larry.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.772
Jorge, maybe someday

07:39.773 --> 07:41.251
you'll win a Spookelton.

07:41.252 --> 07:42.817
Your story

07:42.818 --> 07:44.380
was bone-chilling.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.383
It was not better

07:46.384 --> 07:48.384
than mine.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.262
You know, if that

07:50.263 --> 07:52.138
dead moose is being rude,

07:48.385 --> 07:52.138
you can just take it down.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.787
No, I can't.

07:54.788 --> 07:56.267
He owns the house.

07:58.186 --> 07:59.334
I think she needs to have

07:59.335 --> 08:00.480
her well-water checked.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.963
Ooh, what's in that room

08:03.964 --> 08:05.484
marked "Top Secret"?

08:05.485 --> 08:06.882
I hope it's not

08:06.883 --> 08:08.278
the rest of that moose.

08:08.279 --> 08:09.780
Oh, nothing.

08:09.781 --> 08:11.032
Just what I'm working on

08:11.033 --> 08:12.282
for my new book,

08:12.283 --> 08:13.765
which, despite

08:13.766 --> 08:15.244
the opinion of some,

08:15.245 --> 08:16.601
is going to be

08:16.602 --> 08:17.955
my best book ever.

08:17.956 --> 08:19.124
Can we see what's

08:19.125 --> 08:20.290
behind that door?

08:20.291 --> 08:21.460
I promise

08:21.461 --> 08:22.626
I won't tell anyone.

08:22.627 --> 08:25.214
And even if I do,

08:25.215 --> 08:27.799
I've earned a solid

08:22.627 --> 08:27.799
reputation as a huge liar.

08:29.384 --> 08:30.968
Good for you.

08:30.969 --> 08:32.971
Follow me to the basement.

08:36.307 --> 08:38.059
So, we're going

08:38.061 --> 08:39.811
into the basement

08:36.307 --> 08:39.809
of a crazy woman

08:39.811 --> 08:41.105
who comes up

08:41.106 --> 08:42.397
with clever ideas

08:39.811 --> 08:42.395
to murder people.

08:42.397 --> 08:44.357
- What could possibly
- go wrong?

08:46.693 --> 08:48.777
Right this way.

08:48.778 --> 08:50.114
This is gonna be

08:50.115 --> 08:51.447
so cool!

08:51.448 --> 08:53.283
Remember, you can't say a word

08:53.284 --> 08:55.117
about what you see in here.

08:55.118 --> 08:56.141
Don't worry, my lips

08:56.142 --> 08:57.162
are sealed tighter

08:55.118 --> 08:57.161
than that time

08:57.162 --> 08:58.205
I fell face first

08:58.206 --> 08:59.247
into a sewing machine!

09:02.125 --> 09:05.150
Wow!

09:05.151 --> 09:08.173
Please, look around.

09:02.125 --> 09:08.172
I decorated it myself.

09:08.173 --> 09:10.404
It is not tacky.

09:10.405 --> 09:12.634
It's eclectic!

09:12.635 --> 09:14.263
(SIGHS) Can you believe

09:14.264 --> 09:15.888
how rude they are?

09:15.889 --> 09:17.766
Hey, I had a pet bird

09:17.767 --> 09:19.642
just like this

09:15.889 --> 09:19.641
when I was young.

09:19.642 --> 09:20.957
I begged my dad for

09:20.958 --> 09:22.270
one that was alive,

09:19.642 --> 09:22.269
but he said no.

09:22.270 --> 09:23.334
(DOOR CLOSING)

09:23.335 --> 09:24.396
(LOCK LATCHING)

09:24.397 --> 09:27.191
Uh... Ms. Queen?

09:27.192 --> 09:28.360
Where did she go?

09:28.361 --> 09:29.526
Nice, Lou.

09:29.527 --> 09:31.321
Your childhood is so weird,

09:31.322 --> 09:33.114
it scared off a horror writer.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.536
Uh... Guys,

09:37.537 --> 09:39.119
it's locked.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.997
- (MONITOR BEEPS)
- (CHUCKLING)

09:41.000 --> 09:44.374
Welcome to my Riddle Room.

09:44.375 --> 09:45.584
What's a Riddle Room?

09:45.585 --> 09:47.525
I have a feeling

09:47.526 --> 09:49.464
it's not as cute

09:45.585 --> 09:49.463
as it sounds.

09:49.464 --> 09:50.715
If you want to

09:50.716 --> 09:51.966
get out of there,

09:49.464 --> 09:51.965
you'll have to solve riddles

09:51.966 --> 09:53.322
based on your knowledge

09:53.323 --> 09:54.676
of my books.

09:54.677 --> 09:57.096
So, picture this...

09:57.097 --> 09:58.307
A right answer

09:58.308 --> 09:59.515
gets you another clue.

09:59.516 --> 10:01.100
A wrong answer

10:01.101 --> 10:02.248
gets you stuffed

10:02.249 --> 10:03.393
and put on my wall.

10:03.394 --> 10:04.438
What?

10:04.439 --> 10:05.480
Why would

10:03.394 --> 10:05.479
you do this?

10:05.480 --> 10:07.315
Because she's crazy!

10:08.274 --> 10:10.193
I prefer kooky. Bye.

10:11.319 --> 10:12.778
What are we going to do?

10:12.779 --> 10:14.593
Don't worry, guys.

10:14.594 --> 10:16.407
I'm trained for any

10:12.779 --> 10:16.406
and all situations.

10:16.407 --> 10:17.700
Except this one.

10:21.287 --> 10:22.788
I'm too young to die!

10:22.789 --> 10:24.083
Me, too! I've never

10:24.084 --> 10:25.374
performed at Carnegie Hall!

10:25.375 --> 10:27.126
And I've never...

10:27.127 --> 10:28.545
- I mean,
- I've never even...

10:29.796 --> 10:32.840
Huh, I've done everything.

10:32.841 --> 10:34.009
Forget too young,

10:34.010 --> 10:35.176
I'm too cool to die!

10:36.469 --> 10:38.013
Nobody is going to die!

10:38.014 --> 10:39.556
We just need to find

10:36.469 --> 10:39.555
our first clue.

10:39.556 --> 10:40.599
Wait, remember what

10:40.600 --> 10:41.640
Ms. Queen said?

10:41.641 --> 10:43.518
- That I was a better
- writer than you?

10:44.644 --> 10:46.436
Congratulations, Jorge.

10:46.437 --> 10:48.002
The crazy woman

10:48.003 --> 10:49.566
who's torturing us

10:46.437 --> 10:49.566
thinks you're a good writer.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.132
I meant, she emphasized

10:53.133 --> 10:54.779
the word "picture,"

10:51.484 --> 10:54.779
so that must be a clue.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.031
Maybe it's that picture!

10:58.032 --> 10:59.097
He kinda looks like

10:59.098 --> 11:00.159
my weird Uncle Virgil.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.558
He was a Merchant Marine

11:02.559 --> 11:04.956
who did time for

11:00.160 --> 11:04.955
lima bean smuggling.

11:04.956 --> 11:06.583
I don't know

11:06.584 --> 11:08.209
what's scarier,

11:04.956 --> 11:08.209
this room or Lou's family.

11:09.627 --> 11:11.504
- Maybe there's something
- behind the picture!

11:13.381 --> 11:14.381
Tiffany, no!

11:18.595 --> 11:21.513
Jorge, you saved my life!

11:21.514 --> 11:23.307
Yep, now you owe me.

11:23.308 --> 11:24.518
I'll take my thank you

11:24.519 --> 11:25.727
in kisses.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.168
I'd rather have

11:29.169 --> 11:30.398
an anchor sticking

11:27.937 --> 11:30.398
out of my skull.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.444
- Jorge, how did you - know that anchor
- Was going to fall?

11:34.447 --> 11:36.030
Because that's a picture

11:36.031 --> 11:37.613
of Admiral Smith,

11:37.614 --> 11:39.991
who used an anchor to

11:39.992 --> 11:42.368
kill his nosey first mate

11:37.614 --> 11:42.367
in the book Murder Boat.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.121
How do you remember that?

11:44.122 --> 11:45.872
Yesterday, you forgot to

11:42.368 --> 11:45.872
put on pants for lunch.

11:47.457 --> 11:49.271
And Admiral Smith loved

11:49.272 --> 11:51.084
to leave hidden clues.

11:51.085 --> 11:52.379
Wait, I think

11:52.380 --> 11:53.671
I see something

11:51.085 --> 11:53.670
on the frame!

11:53.671 --> 11:55.631
It says...

11:55.632 --> 11:57.781
"Made in China."

11:57.782 --> 11:59.928
What do you think

11:55.632 --> 11:59.927
that means?

11:59.928 --> 12:01.367
That you're not going

12:01.368 --> 12:02.805
to be much help

11:59.928 --> 12:02.805
solving these riddles.

12:04.223 --> 12:06.184
- Hey, there's something
- written on the scroll.

12:07.435 --> 12:11.521
(SPEAKING GIBBERISH)

12:11.522 --> 12:12.649
The writing is backwards.

12:12.650 --> 12:13.775
Look in the mirror!

12:15.276 --> 12:16.694
"Until I am measured,

12:16.695 --> 12:18.111
I am not known.

12:18.112 --> 12:19.322
"Yet how you miss me

12:19.323 --> 12:20.531
when I have flown."

12:22.492 --> 12:24.451
Oh, the answer is time.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.059
So our next clue must be

12:26.060 --> 12:27.663
in that clock on the wall.

12:27.664 --> 12:29.082
And now it's time

12:29.083 --> 12:30.499
to go home.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.377
- No! The clock
- is a trap, too!

12:36.839 --> 12:37.904
Look! The clue

12:37.905 --> 12:38.967
is in the dart!

12:40.551 --> 12:42.033
Wow, all these traps

12:42.034 --> 12:43.512
are very elaborate.

12:43.513 --> 12:44.931
I know. When does

12:44.932 --> 12:46.349
this woman find

12:43.513 --> 12:46.349
time to write?

12:49.394 --> 12:50.478
(MOANS)

12:52.021 --> 12:53.482
Oh, let me guess.

12:53.483 --> 12:54.941
You think I'm hanging

12:52.021 --> 12:54.940
this net up wrong,

12:54.941 --> 12:56.567
- and you're gonna tell me
- a better way to do it.

12:56.570 --> 12:58.257
Of course not. I will

12:58.258 --> 12:59.946
just come back later

12:56.567 --> 12:59.945
and fix your work.

12:59.946 --> 13:00.989
Per uzsh.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.199
I am sick of fighting.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.472
So let's just not talk

13:05.473 --> 13:06.744
to each other for

13:04.200 --> 13:06.743
the rest of the summer.

13:06.744 --> 13:07.954
Finally, you have

13:07.955 --> 13:09.162
a good idea!

13:09.163 --> 13:10.289
See you in New York!

13:11.791 --> 13:13.042
- Ravi, we're still
- at the same camp.

13:13.045 --> 13:14.377
- You're going to
- see me at dinner.

13:14.380 --> 13:16.379
- Well, that is not
- as dramatic, is it?

13:17.839 --> 13:19.465
- Sorry to interrupt
- your bickering,

13:19.468 --> 13:20.717
But Lou and the kids

13:20.718 --> 13:21.968
still haven't come back

13:19.465 --> 13:21.967
from Stephanie Queen's.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.262
Should we be worried?

13:23.263 --> 13:24.554
Yes! We should

13:21.968 --> 13:24.553
go look for them.

13:24.554 --> 13:26.160
Okay, but I'm not going

13:26.161 --> 13:27.765
to listen to any more

13:24.554 --> 13:27.764
of your stupid fighting.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.725
Message received, Xander.

13:29.726 --> 13:31.165

13:29.726 --> 13:32.602

13:32.603 --> 13:33.980
No, I mean, I'm not

13:33.981 --> 13:35.356
going to listen to it.

13:37.567 --> 13:38.672
(SPEAKING LOUDLY)

13:38.673 --> 13:39.777

you hear the kids screaming.

Uh, you might want to

13:47.849 --> 13:49.494
zoom out a bit, Ms. Queen.

13:49.495 --> 13:50.539
Yeah, and grab

a tissue.

13:51.581 --> 13:53.458
- You got some bats
- in the cave.

13:55.543 --> 13:57.586
There!

13:57.587 --> 14:00.340
Not bad so far,

14:00.341 --> 14:03.092
but the puzzles are

13:57.587 --> 14:03.091
going to get harder.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.428
And your lives are going

14:04.429 --> 14:05.761
to get shorter.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.681
Now, what do you think

14:07.682 --> 14:09.598
of this?

14:09.599 --> 14:11.267
(CHUCKLING)

14:13.644 --> 14:16.711
Uh... I think you're

14:16.712 --> 14:19.776
fooling yourself if you

14:13.644 --> 14:19.775
think you can pass for 22.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.236
It also says

14:21.237 --> 14:22.695
she's great with kids.

14:19.776 --> 14:22.695
That thing is full of lies.

What I meant was,

14:28.368 --> 14:30.516
it seems your camp friends

14:30.517 --> 14:32.662
have come looking for you.

14:36.481 --> 14:38.252
never find you!

What a fine-looking

14:44.302 --> 14:45.592
bunch of young people.

14:45.593 --> 14:46.968
Aw, why, thank you.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.367
I feel like I have

14:48.368 --> 14:49.764
really started to

14:46.969 --> 14:49.764
grow into my face.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.725
- We're looking for
- our friends.

14:52.728 --> 14:53.935
- They came here
- to have lunch with you.

14:53.938 --> 14:55.685
Ah, yes!

22:03.450 --> 22:04.762
Our petty differences

22:04.763 --> 22:06.074
and work together.

22:06.075 --> 22:07.283
Me too.

22:07.284 --> 22:08.786
Oh! Hey, Xander,

22:08.787 --> 22:10.286
what do you think of this?

22:10.287 --> 22:12.831
(SIGHS) Okay, that's it!

22:12.832 --> 22:14.166
- I'm tired of you
- two dragging me

22:14.169 --> 22:15.584
Into the middle of your stupid

22:15.585 --> 22:17.002
fight over a stupid birdhouse!

22:21.340 --> 22:22.780
Actually, we are not

22:22.781 --> 22:24.217
fighting anymore.

22:24.218 --> 22:26.011
- Yeah, we came
- to a compromise.

22:26.845 --> 22:28.597
- Oh...
- (SQUIRTING)

22:32.476 --> 22:33.936
I see you went with the bidet.
