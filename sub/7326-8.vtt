WEBVTT

00:02.273 --> 00:04.635
(Meredith)
GLIOMA... FIBROMA...

00:04.635 --> 00:06.207
BLASTOMA.

00:06.207 --> 00:07.538
WHATEVER THE TUMOR,

00:07.538 --> 00:09.780
PEOPLE ASSUME YOU APPROACH IT
THE SAME WAY.

00:09.780 --> 00:11.782
YOU FIND ITS HIDING PLACE
IN THE BODY,

00:11.782 --> 00:13.684
THEN OPEN THE PATIENT UP...

00:13.684 --> 00:15.246
MIRANDA... M-MIRANDA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:15.246 --> 00:16.717
IT'S 4:00 A.M.
(grunts)

00:16.717 --> 00:20.151
THERE'S A...
(clicks tongue) SMELL...

00:20.151 --> 00:22.323
SOMETHING ROTTING.

00:22.323 --> 00:24.425
I SMELL... NOTHING.

00:24.425 --> 00:27.428
I KNOW MY SON.
BEFORE LEAVING FOR HIS DAD'S,

00:27.428 --> 00:31.802
HE LEFT A PIECE
OF.... FOOD SOMEWHERE.

00:31.802 --> 00:34.335
HEY, LET'S GO BACK TO BED,
GET SOME SLEEP.

00:34.335 --> 00:36.137
TOMORROW'S A BIG DAY.

00:36.137 --> 00:37.538
YOU'RE GOING BACK
TO YOUR OLD JOB.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.070
CAN'T YOU DO THAT
IN YOUR SLEEP?

00:39.070 --> 00:41.572
(clears throat)
YOU WANT ME TO HELP YOU LOOK?

00:41.572 --> 00:45.076
HOW CAN YOU HELP IF YOU
CAN'T EVEN SMELL THE SMELL?

00:47.078 --> 00:48.279
...AND YOU CUT IT
THE HELL OUT.

00:48.279 --> 00:50.251
(clatters)

00:52.383 --> 00:55.556
BUT YOU'RE NOT JUST
FIGHTING THE ONE TUMOR...

00:55.556 --> 00:58.389
(baby wailing)

00:58.389 --> 01:00.691
(man screams)

01:00.691 --> 01:02.333
(zapping and whooshing)
DUDE, YOU'RE JAGO.

01:02.333 --> 01:04.165
COUNTER WITH A WIND KICK.
IT'LL TAKE HIM DOWN.
(punches)

01:04.165 --> 01:07.238
I CAN'T CONCENTRATE
WHEN YOU WATCH ME.

01:07.238 --> 01:09.069
WHAT ARE YOU EVEN DOING
AWAKE?

01:09.069 --> 01:10.841
ARE YOU WORRIED
ABOUT YOUR SURGERY TOMORROW?

01:10.841 --> 01:12.703
NOPE.

01:12.703 --> 01:14.805
CAN'T SLEEP BECAUSE OF
THE CRYING BABY NEXT DOOR.

01:14.805 --> 01:16.677
(man shouts indistinctly)

01:16.677 --> 01:18.679
AND THE...
FROG AND THE MONKEY PICTURE

01:18.679 --> 01:19.780
KIND OF FREAK ME OUT.

01:19.780 --> 01:21.312
(chuckles)

01:21.312 --> 01:22.383
(video game continues zapping)
HEY, IS THIS LEVEL 7?

01:22.383 --> 01:24.155
YEP. WHAT ABOUT YOU?

01:24.155 --> 01:25.456
SHOULDN'T YOU BE RESTING

01:25.456 --> 01:27.388
BEFORE YOU AND DR. GREY
OPERATE ON ME TOMORROW?

01:27.388 --> 01:28.719
VIDEO GAMES ARE GOOD
FOR SURGICAL PRACTICE.

01:28.719 --> 01:29.790
GIMME THAT.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.463
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO BEAT
SABREWULF.

01:32.463 --> 01:35.396
YOU'RE ACTUALLY AT WAR
WITH OVER A BILLION CELLS...

01:35.396 --> 01:37.828
(man) COMBO!

01:37.828 --> 01:40.471
NICE.
TOLD YOU.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.235
DR. GREY?

01:44.235 --> 01:45.576
(gasps) HUH?

01:47.608 --> 01:49.580
YOU WANTED ME
TO WAKE YOU IF, UM--

01:49.580 --> 01:51.742
HOW IS IT?
IT'S STARTING TO HAVE
A SHAPE.

01:53.784 --> 01:55.146
COME LOOK.

02:01.692 --> 02:04.625
(siren wailing in distance)

02:04.625 --> 02:07.698
SO THERE WE WERE, HOUR FOUR
INTO THIS MESSY TRAUMA,

02:07.698 --> 02:09.200
WHEN I SAY,
"THAT'S NOT AN ADHESION,

02:09.200 --> 02:10.301
THAT'S THE URETER."

02:10.301 --> 02:11.562
YOU GUYS--
SHH! I-I--

02:11.562 --> 02:12.603
I'M TELLING A STORY HERE.

02:12.603 --> 02:14.205
UM... OH, UH, CREAMER.

02:14.205 --> 02:15.706
(cup clatters)
YOU SAID IT TO THE ATTENDING?

02:15.706 --> 02:17.208
(coffee pouring)
YEAH, HE BLEW ME OFF.

02:17.208 --> 02:18.809
(spoon clinking)
HE DIDN'T STOP
WHAT HE WAS DOING

02:18.809 --> 02:21.512
UNTIL THE CHIEF RESIDENT
INVOKED THE 2-CHALLENGE RULE.

02:21.512 --> 02:22.673
YOU GUYS...

02:22.673 --> 02:24.345
IT COMES FROM AVIATION.
SAY I'M THE PILOT,

02:24.345 --> 02:26.477
AND YOU'RE MY CO-PILOT.

02:26.477 --> 02:28.219
YOU DISAGREE WITH HOW
I'M FLYING THE PLANE.

02:28.219 --> 02:28.849
(foot tapping)
OKAY, YOU SAY SOMETHING,

02:28.849 --> 02:30.921
AND I FLY THE PLANE
THE SAME WAY.

02:30.921 --> 02:32.653
SOMEONE ELSE SAYS SOMETHING,

02:32.653 --> 02:34.455
AND I DON'T ACKNOWLEDGE IT,

02:34.455 --> 02:36.187
I LOSE.
I HAVE TO GIVE UP CONTROL.

02:36.187 --> 02:37.858
THE 2-CHALLENGE RULE.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.830
I MEAN, THE DOCTORS ADOPTED IT
TO THE O.R.

02:39.830 --> 02:43.163
(foot continues tapping)

02:43.163 --> 02:46.267
EDWARDS, WHAT?!
WE'RE 30 MINUTES AWAY.

02:46.267 --> 02:47.398
FINISH YOUR ROUNDS.

02:47.398 --> 02:48.669
YOU'RE GONNA WANNA BE
IN THE FRONT ROW

02:48.669 --> 02:49.800
WHEN YOUR LIFE CHANGES.

02:49.800 --> 02:50.901
OH, YEAH. I'M READY.

02:50.901 --> 02:52.343
(students murmuring)

02:52.343 --> 02:54.205
DR. WEBBER, YOU WANT
TO COME WITH US?

02:54.205 --> 02:55.776
DR. GREY SAYS YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE UP AND WALKING.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.848
UH, NO YOU... GO ON DOWN.

02:57.848 --> 02:59.510
UH, BUT COME BACK,

02:59.510 --> 03:00.851
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA WANNA HEAR
THE END OF THIS STORY.

03:02.383 --> 03:04.615
(woman) EVERYONE KNOWS
THE END OF THE STORY,

03:04.615 --> 03:06.617
BECAUSE YOU'VE ALREADY
TOLD IT!

03:06.617 --> 03:08.659
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T BE LISTENING
IN ON CONVERSATIONS

03:08.659 --> 03:10.961
THAT TAKE PLACE
IN OTHER PEOPLE'S ROOMS, C.J.

03:10.961 --> 03:14.194
NOT MY FAULT
THAT YOU WORK FOR A HOSPITAL

03:14.194 --> 03:15.526
WITH CRAP-THIN WALLS!

03:15.526 --> 03:16.827
YEAH, GO TAKE A LAP!

03:16.827 --> 03:19.970
I WILL IF YOU DO!

03:23.534 --> 03:25.606
(door opens and closes)
HEY, GUYS!

03:25.606 --> 03:26.907
HEY!
HEY!

03:26.907 --> 03:28.939
SO I HAVE THE RESULTS
OF YOUR COMPATIBILITY TEST.

03:28.939 --> 03:30.941
I'M SURE WE DID GREAT.
IF WE DIDN'T DO GREAT,

03:30.941 --> 03:32.343
WE'LL JUST TAKE IT AGAIN.

03:32.343 --> 03:33.614
I TOOK MY BOARDS TWICE,
SO IT'LL BE FINE, RIGHT?

03:33.614 --> 03:34.845
APRIL, I'M--
I'M SURE WE DID FINE.

03:34.845 --> 03:36.887
I MEAN, WE--WE--
WE DID FINE, RIGHT?

03:36.887 --> 03:38.249
IF I HADN'T
KNOWN YOU TWO ALREADY,

03:38.249 --> 03:39.650
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
YOU CHEATED.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.924
(laughs) 90 PERCENT.
WE CRUSHED IT!

03:43.924 --> 03:45.426
OW!
MM.

03:45.426 --> 03:46.857
YES!
SHE LIKES TO WIN.

03:46.857 --> 03:48.259
YEAH, NO, THAT'S--
THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S GOOD.
(chuckles)

03:48.259 --> 03:49.860
LET ME GET YOUR EXERCISES
FOR THIS WEEK.

03:50.931 --> 03:53.834
(sighs) SO...
(door opens and closes)

03:53.834 --> 03:56.537
LISTEN, UM...

03:56.537 --> 03:59.640
THERE IS ONE... PROBLEM
THAT WE REALLY HAVEN'T...

03:59.640 --> 04:01.742
DISCUSSED.
WHAT?

04:01.742 --> 04:03.243
WELL, COME ON, I MEAN, WE'RE--
WE'RE COMPATIBLE

04:03.243 --> 04:05.746
BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY
NOT... EQUAL.

04:05.746 --> 04:06.877
OH, THAT. YEAH.

04:06.877 --> 04:09.980
I-I-I WASN'T SURE
IF THAT REALLY BOTHERED YOU.

04:09.980 --> 04:12.583
OF COURSE IT REALLY
BOTHERS ME.

04:12.583 --> 04:14.024
WELL, THEN WE SHOULD
JUST FIX IT.

04:14.024 --> 04:15.886
NOW...

04:15.886 --> 04:17.488
(chuckles)
BEFORE WE'RE MARRIED?

04:17.488 --> 04:19.630
YEAH. I MEAN,
THE SOLUTION'S SIMPLE.

04:19.630 --> 04:22.463
YEAH, WE JUST HAVE SEX.
GET A JOINT CHECKING ACCOUNT.

04:27.498 --> 04:29.800
(telephone rings)
SHARKY, RUNDOWN.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.001
I'VE PRE-ROUNDED ON
ALL OF YOUR POST-OPS

04:31.001 --> 04:31.942
AND UPLOADED
YESTERDAY'S NOTES.

04:31.942 --> 04:33.944
MRS. OTT--MY AORTIC
ULCER PATIENT?

04:33.944 --> 04:36.677
UH, ECHO SHOWS
AN IMPROVING E.F. OF 65%.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.609
NATHAN GLAZIER--
MY H.L.H.S. BABY?

04:38.609 --> 04:40.511
(sighs)
SATS FELL TO 87.

04:40.511 --> 04:41.852
NOW IN THE P.I.C.U.
MM.

04:41.852 --> 04:43.984
MR. WU--VALVE REPAIR?

04:43.984 --> 04:46.617
THERE IS NO MR. WU
WITH A VALVE REPAIR.

04:46.617 --> 04:47.888
VERY GOOD.
HERE YOU GO.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.289
WHAT'S THIS FOR?

04:49.289 --> 04:51.922
WELL, YOU STAYED UP ALL NIGHT
KEEPING MY PATIENTS AWAKE

04:51.922 --> 04:53.023
WHILE I GOT
A GOOD NIGHT'S REST.

04:53.023 --> 04:55.295
SO... COFFEE.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.598
(chuckles)
ARE YOU HEADED DOWNSTAIRS?

04:57.598 --> 04:59.370
DR. GREY'S PRESENTING
THE 3-D PRINTER.

04:59.370 --> 05:00.971
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA LOOK AT IT LATER.

05:00.971 --> 05:03.374
I-I WANT TO CHECK ON
THE GLAZIER BABY'S NUMBERS.

05:03.374 --> 05:04.475
P.I.C.U., ONE HOUR.

05:06.076 --> 05:07.578
(whirring)

05:07.578 --> 05:09.410
SO IS THAT MY TUMOR?

05:09.410 --> 05:11.382
YES, AND THIS IS
YOUR ESOPHAGUS,

05:11.382 --> 05:12.983
WHICH WE WILL REMOVE.

05:12.983 --> 05:14.615
AND THEN WE'LL REPLACE IT...

05:14.615 --> 05:16.046
(beeping)
WITH A SECTION OF YOUR COLON
FROM DOWN HERE.

05:16.046 --> 05:19.089
(whirring)
AND PART OF MY ASS
WILL NOW BE MY THROAT.

05:19.089 --> 05:21.752
YOUR COLON IS ACTUALLY
YOUR LARGE INTESTINE,

05:21.752 --> 05:23.994
AND AGAIN WE'RE ONLY GONNA
TAKE A PIECE OF IT.

05:23.994 --> 05:26.026
WELL, HONEY, NOW WHEN
YOU GIVE A RESTAURANT

05:26.026 --> 05:27.528
A BAD REVIEW,
PEOPLE CAN TRULY SAY,

05:27.528 --> 05:28.759
"YOU'RE TALKING
OUT OF YOUR ASS.

05:28.759 --> 05:29.960
(chuckles)
UGH!

05:29.960 --> 05:31.502
WHEN I EAT THEIR FOOD,

05:31.502 --> 05:33.604
I CAN TRULY SAY,
"IT TASTES LIKE CRAP."

05:33.604 --> 05:35.836
THE FOOD WILL NOT
TASTE LIKE CRAP.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.568
HEY, I'M STILL MAD AT YOU
FOR ZANE'S.

05:37.568 --> 05:40.040
I ATE THERE FOR TEN YEARS
UNTIL YOU RUINED IT FOR ME.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.943
OH, PLEASE,
THEY OVER-SALT EVERYTHING.
UH-HUH.

05:42.943 --> 05:46.847
WELL, BARRING COMPLICATIONS,
YOU'LL SOON BE BACK

05:46.847 --> 05:49.019
TO BOSSING US ALL AROUND
ABOUT WHERE WE EAT.

05:52.653 --> 05:53.784
GET ANOTHER ENEMA.

05:53.784 --> 05:54.885
BUT HE ALREADY HAD ONE.

05:54.885 --> 05:56.787
WHICH IS WHY I SAID,
"ANOTHER."

05:56.787 --> 05:57.958
LOOK, WE'RE DEALING
WITH THE MOST CONTAMINATED

05:57.958 --> 05:59.490
PART OF THE BODY.

05:59.490 --> 06:02.863
MM-HMM. OH! CAN I DO IT
AFTER DR. GREY'S PRESENTATION?

06:02.863 --> 06:04.034
I DON'T CARE WHEN YOU DO IT

06:04.034 --> 06:05.566
AS LONG AS YOU DELIVER DUNCAN
TO THE O.R.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.968
WITH A SQUEAKY CLEAN COLON.
(lid clacks)

06:07.968 --> 06:10.671
SO WHEN AN OPENING CAME UP
FOR MATERNAL/FETAL SURGEON,

06:10.671 --> 06:12.473
I THOUGHT OF YOU FIRST.
SO I PITCHED YOU TO THE BOARD.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.144
AND THEY JUST WANT
ONE OF US TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU

06:14.144 --> 06:15.646
TO INTERVIEW YOU.

06:15.646 --> 06:16.877
YOU'LL BE MEETING
WITH DR. TORRES.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.909
HER RESUME REALLY
SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.

06:18.909 --> 06:20.411
THIS IS MORE OF A FORMALITY.

06:20.411 --> 06:21.712
WELL, AND MAYBE
AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN

06:21.712 --> 06:23.083
A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THE WOMAN
YOU'RE DATING.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.815
NOT NECESSARY AT ALL.

06:24.815 --> 06:27.057
SO... ANYTHING YOU CAN
TELL ME ABOUT DR. TORRES?

06:27.057 --> 06:29.460
UM... SHE'S GREAT.
I MEAN, SHE'S MY EX...

06:29.460 --> 06:30.691
(chuckles) SO SHE'S NOT
THAT GREAT.

06:30.691 --> 06:32.162
LOOK, I'M SURE SHE'S PROBABLY
NOT AN AX MURDERER,

06:32.162 --> 06:33.894
BUT IF THERE'S SOMETHING THERE,
I WILL GIVE YOU A HEADS-UP.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.666
PLEASE DON'T.
JUST BE YOURSELF.

06:35.666 --> 06:37.968
HEY.
HI! UM, THIS IS
DR. EMMA MARLING.

06:37.968 --> 06:39.970
DR. CALLIE TORRES.
GOOD TO MEET YOU.

06:39.970 --> 06:43.474
LET'S DO THIS.
(chuckles)

06:43.474 --> 06:46.937
DR. AVERY, MRS. MADDOX IS HERE
TO GET HER DRAIN REMOVED,

06:46.937 --> 06:47.908
AND I'LL DO IT
AFTER THE PRESENTATION.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.880
I'LL DO IT MYSELF, MURPHY.
REALLY?

06:49.880 --> 06:52.543
BECAUSE I KNOW THE CASE--
NAH, I PREFER
TO DO IT MYSELF.

06:52.543 --> 06:53.944
THANKS.

06:53.944 --> 06:55.415
(indistinct conversations)

06:55.415 --> 06:56.917
WHAT, DID I MISS IT?

06:56.917 --> 06:58.749
YOU DIDN'T MISS IT.
DO YOU THINK THEY
MADE A HEART?

06:58.749 --> 07:01.021
MM, STEPH WON'T SAY, BUT I THINK
A HEART'S TOO COMPLICATED.
HEY.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.423
A BLADDER?

07:03.423 --> 07:04.595
COME ON.
WHAT'D YOU GUYS PRINT?

07:04.595 --> 07:05.826
I'M NOT SAYING.

07:05.826 --> 07:06.927
BUT YOUR MINDS
WILL BE FREAKIN' BLOWN.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.129
(sighs)

07:09.129 --> 07:11.562
HEY, HOW'D THE DROP-OFF
AT DAY CARE GO?

07:11.562 --> 07:13.033
TEAR-FREE.
HOW'S YOUR NEW TOY?

07:13.033 --> 07:15.466
WELL, YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT
AND SEE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

07:15.466 --> 07:16.737
(Owen clears throat)
GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE.

07:16.737 --> 07:18.008
MORNING.

07:19.710 --> 07:21.572
(machine whirring)

07:21.572 --> 07:23.013
GREY-SLOAN MEMORIAL HAS ALWAYS

07:23.013 --> 07:25.476
VALUED INNOVATION
AS A TOP PRIORITY.

07:25.476 --> 07:28.849
AND TODAY, THE LEADER
OF THIS CHARGE IS DR. GREY.

07:28.849 --> 07:31.522
WE SHOULD ALL FOLLOW HER
IN PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES,

07:31.522 --> 07:34.985
MOVING MEDICINE FORWARD,
FINDING NEW WAYS TO INNOVATE.

07:34.985 --> 07:39.029
DR. GREY?
3-D PRINTING WILL ALLOW US
TO CUSTOMIZE TREATMENT

07:39.029 --> 07:41.592
FOR AN INDIVIDUAL'S
SPECIFIC NEEDS.

07:41.592 --> 07:44.995
INSTEAD OF ORDERING AND WAITING
FOR AN IMPLANT...
(whispers) DO YOU SEE THAT?

07:44.995 --> 07:46.537
WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE
TO PRINT...
THE PRINTER, YEAH, IT'S COOL.

07:46.537 --> 07:48.669
IN-HOUSE, ON-DEMAND--
NO, NO, THE GUY NEXT TO HER...

07:48.669 --> 07:49.900
RIGHT HERE.
...WITH THE EYE TWITCH.

07:49.900 --> 07:52.042
EVENTUALLY, EVEN USING
A PATIENT'S OWN CELLS

07:52.042 --> 07:54.004
TO PREVENT REJECTION.

07:54.004 --> 07:58.048
WELCOME TO THE AGE
OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE.
HMM.

07:59.850 --> 08:01.952
(woman) A FORK?
(man) OH, NO.

08:01.952 --> 08:03.714
(murmuring)

08:03.714 --> 08:04.815
(man) TECHNOLOGY.

08:04.815 --> 08:06.016
(man) WELL, AT LEAST
IT ISN'T A SPORK.

08:06.016 --> 08:08.759
YOU GUYS,

08:08.759 --> 08:10.490
WE JUST GOT THE PRINTER
YESTERDAY.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.192
WE'RE TESTING IT OUT.
FORKS TODAY...

08:12.192 --> 08:16.567
TOMORROW, PORTAL VEINS
FOR ACTUAL PEOPLE.

08:16.567 --> 08:18.569
YOU GUYS!

08:28.078 --> 08:30.811
(telephone rings in distance)

08:30.811 --> 08:32.242
OH, IF YOUR MOTHER
COULD SEE YOU NOW.

08:32.242 --> 08:34.284
SHE'D TAKE ISSUE
WITH MY HAIR.

08:34.284 --> 08:36.046
SHE'D BE PROUD.

08:36.046 --> 08:38.048
DID I EVER TELL YOU
THE STORY ABOUT HOW I CHOSE

08:38.048 --> 08:40.821
MY FIRST RESEARCH PROJECT?
MANY TIMES. YOU KNOW,

08:40.821 --> 08:42.092
IT'S LOOKING A LITTLE
TOO COMFY IN HERE.

08:42.092 --> 08:43.754
ARE YOU GETTING YOUR LAPS IN?

08:43.754 --> 08:45.025
YOU CAN GET ONE IN NOW.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.857
YOU CAN WALK ME TO THE ELEVATOR.
I HAVE A PATIENT TO SEE.

08:46.857 --> 08:48.098
GO CHANGE THE FACE
OF MEDICINE.

08:48.098 --> 08:50.060
YOU NEED TO BE DOING
YOUR LAPS.

08:50.060 --> 08:52.062
YOU NEED TO BE WALKING.

08:52.062 --> 08:54.905
(C.J.) ANOTHER CAPTIVE
RUNS SCREAMING

08:54.905 --> 08:58.038
FROM YOUR THEATER OF...
BOREDOM.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.140
MOVE ALONG, C.J.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.212
OH, YOU KNOW,
YOU NEED SOME NEW MATERIAL?

09:02.212 --> 09:04.715
I KNOW YOUR ENTIRE REPERTOIRE
BY HEART.

09:04.715 --> 09:06.176
THEY'RE GOOD STORIES.

09:06.176 --> 09:09.119
YOU SEE? EVEN DR. KEPNER'S
HEARD THEM MULTIPLE TIMES.

09:09.119 --> 09:11.822
YOU SHOULD COME TAKE
A WALK WITH ME. COME ON.

09:11.822 --> 09:15.155
I'LL TELL YOU SOME
REALLY GOOD STORIES.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.658
YOU GET A HEAD START.
I'LL CATCH UP.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.690
(sighs)

09:19.690 --> 09:21.592
AND CLOSE YOUR GOWN.
I CAN SEE YOUR UNDERWEAR.

09:21.592 --> 09:25.836
I'M NOT WEARING ANY.
(chuckles)

09:25.836 --> 09:28.969
UH, HARVEY?
YES?

09:28.969 --> 09:30.641
CAN I HELP YOU?
NO, BUT I THINK I CAN
HELP YOU.

09:30.641 --> 09:32.242
I CAN FIX THAT.
IT'LL TAKE ABOUT 30 MINUTES.

09:32.242 --> 09:33.744
FIX WHAT?

09:33.744 --> 09:36.747
THE TWITCH.
(scoffs) I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU ARE,

09:36.747 --> 09:38.108
BUT FRANKLY THIS IS
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

09:38.108 --> 09:41.051
AND IT'S NOT A TWITCH,
IT'S A--
A HEMIFACIAL SPASM.

09:41.051 --> 09:42.112
SEE I CAN DECOMPRESS
THE NERVE.

09:42.112 --> 09:44.054
IT'S MINIMALLY INVASIVE.
IT'S BARELY EVEN A SURGERY.

09:44.054 --> 09:45.355
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

09:45.355 --> 09:47.187
HE'S DEREK SHEPHERD--
ONE OF THE BEST NEUROSURGEONS

09:47.187 --> 09:49.189
IN THE COUNTRY. I REALLY THINK
YOU SHOULD LET HIM FIX IT.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.892
AND WHO ARE YOU?
JACKSON AVERY--
PLASTICS, E.N.T.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.193
I WOULD REALLY LOVE TO OBSERVE
IF THAT'S COOL WITH YOU.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.364
NO, THAT'S NOT COOL.

09:54.364 --> 09:55.796
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

09:55.796 --> 09:56.897
I HAVEN'T HAD A THING TO EAT
ALL MORNING.

09:56.897 --> 09:59.199
IF YOU DON'T EAT,
I CAN DO IT TODAY.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.231
(doughnut thuds)
MM-HMM. MM-HMM.

10:01.231 --> 10:04.274
(elevator bell dings,
doors open)

10:04.274 --> 10:06.707
DID YOU HEAR MER
JUST REVOLUTIONIZED

10:06.707 --> 10:08.078
THE WORLD OF CUTLERY?

10:08.078 --> 10:10.941
NO, I... DID NOT.

10:10.941 --> 10:14.645
WORKING ON A LIVER MODEL.
IT'S--IT'S PRINTING UP NOW.

10:14.645 --> 10:16.787
THAT'S GREAT.

10:16.787 --> 10:18.749
IT IS GREAT.

10:20.050 --> 10:21.251
(bell dings)

10:22.392 --> 10:23.794
(doors open)

10:29.830 --> 10:31.361
WHAT THE HELL'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU TWO?
STAY OUT OF IT.

10:31.361 --> 10:32.963
OKAY.

10:32.963 --> 10:34.204
THANKS FOR LETTING ME
PICK UP A FEW SHIFTS.

10:34.204 --> 10:35.666
I APPRECIATE THAT.
ABSOLUTELY.

10:35.666 --> 10:37.237
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.270
UH, THAT'S WRONG.

10:40.270 --> 10:42.973
MY ESOPHAGECTOMY IS SUPPOSED
TO BE IN O.R. 2.

10:42.973 --> 10:44.644
SORRY, TRAUMA CAME IN
THIS MORNING,

10:44.644 --> 10:46.216
AND NOW YOU'RE IN...
O.R. 3.

10:46.216 --> 10:48.148
BUT I PLANNED FOR O.R. 2.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.319
IT WAS SET UP EXACTLY
THE WAY I NEEDED IT

10:49.319 --> 10:50.350
FOR MY PROCEDURE.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.753
O.R. 3's IDENTICAL
TO O.R. 2.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.184
GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK, BEN.

10:54.184 --> 10:57.758
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

10:57.758 --> 10:58.889
UM...

10:58.889 --> 11:00.260
WHAT'S WRONG WITH O.R. 3?

11:00.260 --> 11:01.762
IS THERE A SMELL
IN THERE, TOO?

11:01.762 --> 11:05.766
THERE IS A SMELL
IN TUCK'S ROOM,

11:05.766 --> 11:10.841
AND I'M GONNA FIND IT.

11:17.177 --> 11:20.210
(fussing)

11:20.210 --> 11:22.412
MR. AND MRS. GLAZIER.

11:22.412 --> 11:23.683
(voice breaking)
DID YOU FIGURE OUT

11:23.683 --> 11:25.916
WHY NATHAN'S NOT GETTING
ANY BETTER?

11:25.916 --> 11:27.217
THE LEFT SIDE
OF YOUR SON'S HEART

11:27.217 --> 11:30.060
CAN'T EFFECTIVELY PUMP BLOOD
TO THE REST OF HIS BODY.

11:30.060 --> 11:31.992
SO LAST WEEK WE INSERTED
SOMETHING

11:31.992 --> 11:33.864
TO HELP DIVERT THE BLOOD FLOW
TO THE RIGHT SIDE.

11:33.864 --> 11:35.225
RIGHT, YOU PUT IN
THE CONDUIT.

11:35.225 --> 11:36.927
IS IT NOT WORKING
OR SOMETHING?

11:36.927 --> 11:38.198
THE CONDUIT IS SYNTHETIC.

11:38.198 --> 11:41.231
SO IN SOME CASES, THE BODY
REFUSES TO ACCEPT IT.

11:41.231 --> 11:43.073
WE BELIEVE NATHAN IS IN
THE BEGINNING STAGES

11:43.073 --> 11:44.074
OF REJECTION.

11:44.074 --> 11:46.476
(Shane) WE'RE RUNNING
MORE TESTS TO BE SURE.

11:46.476 --> 11:48.809
AND WHAT HAPPENS
IF HE'S REJECTING IT?

11:48.809 --> 11:51.111
WELL, FIRST WE TREAT IT
WITH MEDICATION.

11:51.111 --> 11:53.083
BUT WORST-CASE SCENARIO,
WE TAKE IT OUT

11:53.083 --> 11:54.384
AND PUT IN A NEW ONE...

11:54.384 --> 11:55.816
WITH ANOTHER
SYNTHETIC ONE,

11:55.816 --> 11:58.018
BUT WON'T HE JUST
REJECT THAT ONE, TOO?

11:58.018 --> 12:00.150
LET'S NOT GET AHEAD
OF OURSELVES JUST YET.

12:00.150 --> 12:02.292
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW AS SOON
AS WE HAVE MORE INFORMATION.

12:02.292 --> 12:04.224
YOU SAID YOU HAVE ANSWERS,

12:04.224 --> 12:06.096
BUT YOU REALLY DON'T,
DO YOU?

12:10.200 --> 12:13.103
OKAY, SO THEN, UM,
AFTER U.W.,

12:13.103 --> 12:14.164
YOU WENT TO
THE CLEVELAND CLINIC--

12:14.164 --> 12:16.106
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.
MM-HMM...

12:16.106 --> 12:18.068
(chuckles)
UNDER LACY.

12:18.068 --> 12:20.911
AND THE FOCUS THERE WAS ON
CONGENITAL HEART DISORDERS.

12:20.911 --> 12:23.944
OH, BUT THEN YOU LEFT
AFTER ONLY A YEAR?

12:23.944 --> 12:25.275
YEAH, THERE WERE SO MANY
GREAT OPPORTUNITIES OUT HERE--

12:25.275 --> 12:26.446
IN SEATTLE.

12:26.446 --> 12:29.119
REALLY?

12:29.119 --> 12:33.123
AND THERE WERE SOME
PERSONAL ELEMENTS AT PLAY, TOO.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.227
(telephone rings)

12:37.227 --> 12:39.529
I WAS, UH, GOING THROUGH
A DIVORCE.

12:39.529 --> 12:41.131
AND WE BOTH
WORKED AT THE CLINIC,

12:41.131 --> 12:43.493
AND THAT BECAME UNTENABLE,
IT WAS AFFECTING MY WORK,

12:43.493 --> 12:44.494
SO I MADE A MOVE.

12:44.494 --> 12:46.396
OH.

12:46.396 --> 12:49.139
NO, RIGHT, YEAH, NO,
I-I GET THAT.

12:49.139 --> 12:51.071
SO THEN YOU MOVED
TO SEATTLE PRES?

12:51.071 --> 12:53.073
YES.
A YEAR AS AN ATTENDING,

12:53.073 --> 12:55.075
AND THEN RUNNING
THE MATERNAL/FETAL DEPARTMENT

12:55.075 --> 12:56.406
FOR THE LAST YEAR.

12:56.406 --> 12:58.248
MY RESEARCH--
WAS THAT HARD FOR YOU--

12:58.248 --> 13:00.250
TO GIVE UP YOUR JOB--

13:00.250 --> 13:03.013
WELL, YOUR CITY--
TO YOUR EX?

13:03.013 --> 13:06.416
UH... (exhales deeply)

13:06.416 --> 13:09.089
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO WAKE HIM.

13:09.089 --> 13:10.821
(sighs)

13:10.821 --> 13:11.862
COME ON, BUDDY.

13:11.862 --> 13:13.994
WE'VE LET YOU SLEEP IN
LONG ENOUGH.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.866
GOOD MORNING, WILL.
(monitor beeps)

13:15.866 --> 13:17.367
(inhales deeply and grunts)

13:17.367 --> 13:20.270
MY BIG DAY STARTED OUT
AS A NIGHTMARE

13:20.270 --> 13:22.232
WHEN A CLOWN CAME IN
AT DAWN,

13:22.232 --> 13:24.875
ASKING ME IF I WANTED
A BALLOON ANIMAL.

13:24.875 --> 13:28.278
CLOWNS ARE
A PEDS FLOOR HAZARD.
(chuckles)

13:28.278 --> 13:29.980
ARE YOU STILL GOING
TO TRY TO REMOVE

13:29.980 --> 13:31.241
ALL OF THE TUMORS TODAY?

13:31.241 --> 13:33.944
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IT'S A LOT
TO DO ALL AT ONCE.

13:33.944 --> 13:36.146
WILL'S CANCER IS
A VERY AGGRESSIVE SARCOMA.

13:36.146 --> 13:38.088
IT'S AN ALL-OR-NOTHING
APPROACH.

13:38.088 --> 13:39.819
WE'VE COME UP WITH A PLAN
TO REMOVE ALL OF THEM,

13:39.819 --> 13:41.391
STARTING WITH NUMBER ONE.

13:41.391 --> 13:43.193
SOME WILL BE A SNAP,
BUT THERE ARE A FEW TRICKY ONES,

13:43.193 --> 13:45.055
LIKE TUMOR NUMBER EIGHT.

13:45.055 --> 13:48.128
IT'S DEEP IN THE LIVER,
BUT WE'LL DO OUR BEST TO GET IT.

13:48.128 --> 13:49.229
WE'LL GET IT.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.261
WE'LL TRY.

13:51.261 --> 13:54.364
UM, IT'S SORT OF LIKE TRYING
TO GET PAST LEVEL SIX.

13:54.364 --> 13:55.936
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE SOME,
UH, FIGHTERS,

13:55.936 --> 13:58.108
BUT WE NEED
TO BE REALLY PRECISE.

13:58.108 --> 14:01.972
WE WILL EAT ALL THOSE DOTS
AND KILL ALL THOSE GHOSTS.

14:01.972 --> 14:05.045
SHE DOESN'T PLAY
VIDEO GAMES.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.216
WE'LL SEE YOU IN THE O.R.

14:09.149 --> 14:10.580
(door hisses)

14:10.580 --> 14:13.253
(woman speaks indistinctly)

14:13.253 --> 14:14.985
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:14.985 --> 14:16.186
OH, I SWITCHED WITH KNOX.

14:16.186 --> 14:18.228
UH, BEN WARREN.

14:18.228 --> 14:20.490
UH, I DON'T KNOW IF WE MET
BEFORE I LEFT.

14:20.490 --> 14:23.063
(Jo) OH, OH I WAS ACTUALLY
AT YOUR WEDDING.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.165
I GOT YOU THAT PIZZA STONE.

14:25.165 --> 14:26.396
WE HAVE A PIZZA STONE?

14:26.396 --> 14:29.199
(chuckles) YEAH, I GOT YOU,
A, UH, A CIRCULAR CLAY STONE

14:29.199 --> 14:31.271
ABOUT 15 INCHES IN DIAMETER.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.643
IT'S KIND OF MY STANDARD GIFT.

14:33.643 --> 14:35.145
YEAH, I-I JUST USED--
ALWAYS USED

14:35.145 --> 14:37.247
YOUR TYPICAL COOKIE SHEET
AND POKED HOLES IN THE FOIL.

14:37.247 --> 14:40.050
(muffled voice) OH, WELL THEN
THIS WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE.

14:40.050 --> 14:43.313
THE CRUST THAT ALWAYS STICK TO
THE EDGES NEVER GET BURNED.
(clattering)

14:43.313 --> 14:46.156
(muffled voice) YOU CAN
REALLY TELL THE DIFFERENCE?
MM-HMM, IT'S THE WAY
PEOPLE SHOULD BE EATING.

14:46.156 --> 14:48.118
YOU WOULD NEVER USE...

14:48.118 --> 14:49.259
(deep whoosh)

14:49.259 --> 14:52.222
YOU BROKE SCRUB.
I'M SORRY?

14:52.222 --> 14:54.124
YOUR LEFT HAND DROPPED
BELOW THE STERILE FIELD.

14:54.124 --> 14:55.395
GO RE-SCRUB.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.227
I DIDN'T MOVE MY HAND--
YES...

14:57.227 --> 14:58.929
IT DID. I SAW IT.

14:58.929 --> 15:00.570
YOU WANT TO CALL ME
A LIAR,

15:00.570 --> 15:02.202
YOU NEED TO GO RE-SCRUB NOW.

15:06.136 --> 15:08.178
(door hisses,
opens and closes)

15:08.178 --> 15:11.211
MIRANDA...
YOU NEED A MINUTE?

15:11.211 --> 15:14.044
I NEED A QUIET O.R.
SO WE CAN BEGIN.

15:17.487 --> 15:18.648
10 BLADE.

15:24.694 --> 15:26.056
(bell dings)
RIGHT HERE.

15:26.056 --> 15:27.427
WELL,
YOUR E.M.G. DID CONFIRM

15:27.427 --> 15:28.959
THAT IT IS
A HEMIFACIAL SPASM.

15:28.959 --> 15:30.100
SO WE'LL JUST GET YOU STARTED
ON SOME PRE-OP TESTS.

15:30.100 --> 15:32.002
WAIT, I KNOW I SIGNED THE FORM,

15:32.002 --> 15:34.004
BUT HOW DO I KNOW
THIS IS GONNA WORK?

15:34.004 --> 15:36.936
I MEAN, I'VE ALREADY TRIED
BOTOX, MUSCLE RELAXERS, AND--

15:36.936 --> 15:40.040
WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU SELL
MORE THAN JUST 3-D PRINTERS.
CORRECT.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.271
YOU KNOW--
I ALSO SELL INK CARTRIDGES.

15:41.271 --> 15:43.273
NO, NO, WHAT I MEAN
IS THAT YOU SELL INSPIRATION.

15:43.273 --> 15:45.175
YOU ARE THE FUTURE FACE
OF MEDICINE.

15:45.175 --> 15:47.017
DON'T YOU WANT THAT FACE
TO BE TWITCH-FREE?

15:47.017 --> 15:48.948
THE SURGERY WILL WORK.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.550
SEE? YOU SHOULD LISTEN
TO HIM.

15:50.550 --> 15:51.951
HE'S A GUY IN A BATHROBE.

15:51.951 --> 15:52.983
I'M DR. RICHARD WEBBER.

15:52.983 --> 15:54.724
I BASICALLY TRAINED THESE TWO.

15:54.724 --> 15:56.956
YOU'RE IN GOOD HANDS.

15:56.956 --> 15:57.957
RIGHT THIS WAY.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.489
DR. AVERY...

15:59.489 --> 16:01.261
I KNOW YOU SAID YOU REMOVED
MRS. MADDOX'S DRAIN,

16:01.261 --> 16:02.662
BUT I'M WORRIED
ABOUT A SEROMA.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.664
SHOULD I GO AHEAD AND--
NO, NO, DON'T DO ANYTHING.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.296
I'LL DO IT MYSELF
AFTER SURGERY.

16:06.296 --> 16:08.638
(Richard) HEY, MURPHY!
(whistles)

16:08.638 --> 16:09.739
GET IN HERE.

16:09.739 --> 16:12.542
YOU DIDN'T HEAR
THE END OF MY STORY. COME.

16:12.542 --> 16:14.604
I GO TO HIS HOUSE,
WE EAT DINNER,

16:14.604 --> 16:17.007
WE TALK, WE WATCH TV,
WE TALK...
(coffee pot clatters)

16:17.007 --> 16:20.610
WE KISS, WE... OTHER STUFF,
AND THEN WE STOP.

16:20.610 --> 16:23.313
I GO HOME, AND IT'S HARD,
YOU KNOW,

16:23.313 --> 16:24.714
BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M MISSING.

16:24.714 --> 16:25.985
I KNOW WHAT I'M MISSING.
(refrigerator door thuds)

16:25.985 --> 16:28.288
WHAT DO I DO?
HMM? WELL, OKAY, HOLD ON.

16:28.288 --> 16:30.090
WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU ASKING ME?

16:30.090 --> 16:32.622
WELL... (sighs)
HOW DO I RESIST?

16:32.622 --> 16:34.764
(sighs) REMEMBER WHEN
YOU HAD THAT FLIRTATION

16:34.764 --> 16:36.766
WITH INTERN MURPHY,
AND THEN YOU DECIDED NOT

16:36.766 --> 16:39.499
TO TAKE IT ANY FURTHER?
OH. YEAH.

16:39.499 --> 16:40.730
UM, I TOOK THAT FURTHER.

16:40.730 --> 16:42.502
YOU HAD SEX?

16:42.502 --> 16:43.633
(whispers) YEAH.

16:43.633 --> 16:44.774
WAS IT--
AWESOME.

16:44.774 --> 16:46.606
THIS IS NOT--YOU'RE NOT...

16:46.606 --> 16:50.080
I HAVE TO GO AWAY
FROM YOU NOW.

16:50.080 --> 16:51.211
(door opens)

16:51.211 --> 16:54.284
(suction gurgling)

16:54.284 --> 16:56.446
READY WITH
TUMOR NUMBER ONE.

16:56.446 --> 17:00.250
(beep)
OKAY, YOU SEE THAT?
ALREADY GOING GREAT. ONE DOWN...

17:00.250 --> 17:02.722
14 TO GO. I WISH WE HAD
GOTTEN TO HIM SOONER.

17:02.722 --> 17:05.095
HE WAS DIAGNOSED
ALREADY STAGE IV.

17:05.095 --> 17:06.256
TYPICAL TEENAGER.

17:06.256 --> 17:07.757
HE IGNORED HIS SYMPTOMS,

17:07.757 --> 17:09.429
DIDN'T WANT TO ASK FOR HELP
FROM ANYONE...
(clattering)

17:09.429 --> 17:11.801
AND NOW HE'S GOT AN ABDOMEN
COMPLETELY COVERED WITH TUMORS.

17:11.801 --> 17:13.803
WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT.
HE IS A TYPICAL TEENAGER,

17:13.803 --> 17:15.465
WHICH MEANS HE CAN BEAT THIS.

17:15.465 --> 17:18.768
HE'S STRONG, ABLE TO FIGHT.
AND WHAT'S BETTER?

17:18.768 --> 17:20.610
WHAT?
HE'S IN MY O.R.--

17:20.610 --> 17:22.412
IN THE O.R. OF SOMEONE
STANDING ON THE FOREFRONT

17:22.412 --> 17:23.543
OF MEDICINE.

17:23.543 --> 17:24.814
YOU SHOULD PRINT A SPOON NEXT.

17:24.814 --> 17:26.576
THAT WAY WE'LL BE ABLE
TO REACH TUMOR NUMBER TWO.

17:26.576 --> 17:29.719
(suction continues gurgling)

17:29.719 --> 17:31.651
(whirring)
IT IS AN ANATOMICALLY CORRECT
LIVER MODEL

17:31.651 --> 17:35.155
WITH A PORTAL VEIN.
IT'S A PLASTIC BLOB.
I'M STARVING.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.686
CAN THEY PRINT FOOD
OR JUST UTENSILS?

17:36.686 --> 17:38.758
WHEN WILL THE MODEL BE DONE?
10, MAYBE 12 HOURS.

17:38.758 --> 17:39.829
THAT LONG?

17:39.829 --> 17:41.561
IT'S LIFE-SAVING TECHNOLOGY,
SHANE.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.233
IF YOU WANT IT FASTER,
PAGE GOD.

17:43.233 --> 17:45.565
IT'S A FAKE ORGAN.
HOW LONG FOR FUNCTIONAL ITEMS?

17:45.565 --> 17:47.737
LIKE AN ACTUAL VASCULAR GRAFT?
LIKE A PRETZEL.

17:47.737 --> 17:49.369
OH, HERE IT IS--

17:49.369 --> 17:50.770
"BIODEGRADABLE POLYMERS."

17:50.770 --> 17:52.142
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

17:52.142 --> 17:54.804
NOTHING.
IT'S JUST INTERESTING.

17:54.804 --> 17:56.446
PRINTING'S THE FUTURE.

17:56.446 --> 17:58.748
WHAT'S A TYPICAL SATURDAY
LIKE FOR YOU?

17:58.748 --> 17:59.779
OH, WELL, LISTEN,

17:59.779 --> 18:02.552
I KNOW THAT THE NEW ATTENDINGS
PULL THE MOST CALL.

18:02.552 --> 18:03.753
SO I HAVE NO PROBLEM
WORKING WEEKENDS.

18:03.753 --> 18:06.616
OH, YEAH, NO. I-I'M JUST--
I'M WONDERING...

18:06.616 --> 18:08.087
WHAT YOU DO FOR FUN.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.260
WHAT FEEDS YOUR SOUL?

18:10.260 --> 18:13.092
I, UH, READ.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.165
I LIKE TO COOK.
I LIKE MOVIES.

18:15.165 --> 18:19.469
I HAVE A GERMAN SHEPHERD MIX
NAMED LILA.

18:19.469 --> 18:21.171
BUT NO KIDS...

18:21.171 --> 18:22.532
FROM YOUR PREVIOUS MARRIAGE?

18:22.532 --> 18:24.334
WELL, PREVIOUS MARRIAGE?
(chuckles)

18:24.334 --> 18:25.705
NO, I'M JUST, UH,
I'M JUST--

18:25.705 --> 18:27.307
I'M JUST SAYIN', IS, UH...

18:27.307 --> 18:29.379
IS KIDS SOMETHING YOU SEE
DOWN THE LINE IN YOUR FUTURE?

18:29.379 --> 18:31.241
DO YOU--
DO YOU WANT KIDS?

18:31.241 --> 18:33.313
I'M SORRY.

18:33.313 --> 18:35.815
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN
ASK ME THIS LEGALLY

18:35.815 --> 18:36.786
IN A JOB INTERVIEW.

18:36.786 --> 18:38.788
OH, OF COURSE NOT.

18:38.788 --> 18:40.450
OF COURSE NOT. NO.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:40.450 --> 18:43.423
FORGET I ASKED.
I HAVEN'T GIVEN
MUCH THOUGHT TO KIDS.

18:43.423 --> 18:44.694
(clicks tongue)
PLEASE, NEVER MIND.

18:44.694 --> 18:47.157
BUT IF I DO, OR WHEN I DO,

18:47.157 --> 18:48.898
I IMAGINE GIRLS--TWO.

18:48.898 --> 18:50.900
I KNOW THAT THEY'LL BE HELL
IN JUNIOR HIGH,

18:50.900 --> 18:53.663
BUT, UH...
I GREW UP WITH SISTERS.

18:53.663 --> 18:55.765
AW. NICE.

18:55.765 --> 18:56.906
YEAH.

18:58.868 --> 19:00.840
(clicks pen)
JUST A FEW MORE QUESTIONS.

19:00.840 --> 19:01.811
MORE?

19:01.811 --> 19:04.714
(knock on door)
HEY, HOW'S, UH...

19:04.714 --> 19:05.675
HOW'S IT ALL... GOING?

19:05.675 --> 19:08.548
IT'S GREAT.
(mouths words)

19:08.548 --> 19:10.750
YEAH, WE'RE--
YEAH, WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS.

19:10.750 --> 19:11.921
GOOD.
YEAH.

19:11.921 --> 19:13.683
(clears throat)

19:13.683 --> 19:14.824
(door closes)

19:14.824 --> 19:17.527
IN JAPAN,
THEY'RE 3-D MAKING CONDUITS

19:17.527 --> 19:18.688
AND SEEDING THEM
WITH THE PATIENT'S CELLS

19:18.688 --> 19:21.391
BEFORE IMPLANTING THEM, TAKING
AWAY THE RISK OF REJECTION.

19:21.391 --> 19:22.862
UH-HUH. YAY, JAPAN.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.394
WHY CAN'T WE DO THAT?

19:24.394 --> 19:25.865
WHY CAN'T WE USE
A 3-D PRINTER TO CREATE

19:25.865 --> 19:28.468
A CONDUIT THAT NATHAN'S BODY
WOULD RECOGNIZE AS HIS OWN?

19:28.468 --> 19:29.739
HE WOULDN'T NEED
SURGERY AFTER SURGERY

19:29.739 --> 19:31.671
TO KEEP REPLACING
THE FAILED SYNTHETIC ONE.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.743
IT'S BRILLIANT,
BUT THE RESEARCH ALONE--

19:33.743 --> 19:35.805
I THOUGHT YOU'D SAY THAT.
HERE ARE THE JAPANESE STUDIES.

19:35.805 --> 19:39.449
(sighs) WE WOULD NEED
EXTENSIVE IMAGING

19:39.449 --> 19:40.750
TO SEE IF NATHAN'S
EVEN A CANDIDATE.

19:40.750 --> 19:41.711
ALSO COVERED.

19:41.711 --> 19:43.613
I'VE SCHEDULED A CARDIAC C.T.
AND M.R.I.

19:43.613 --> 19:46.456
IT'S--IT'S TOO EXPERIMENTAL.

19:46.456 --> 19:47.887
WE'D HAVE TO FILE
A COMPASSIONATE RELEASE

19:47.887 --> 19:49.759
WITH THE F.D.A.,
GET APPROVAL.

19:49.759 --> 19:52.262
THESE THINGS TAKE TIME
THAT NATHAN MAY NOT HAVE.

19:52.262 --> 19:54.794
IF I START THE GROUND WORK
WITH THE F.D.A...
(files rustle)

19:54.794 --> 19:56.366
THEN WILL YOU CONSIDER IT?

19:59.669 --> 20:02.372
(sighs) SURE.

20:02.372 --> 20:04.674
(chuckles)

20:04.674 --> 20:06.936
(man) RIGHT THERE.
(siren wailing)

20:06.936 --> 20:07.937
CAN WE TALK?

20:07.937 --> 20:09.679
HI. YES, CAN WE?

20:09.679 --> 20:11.881
(indistinct conversations)

20:11.881 --> 20:13.813
ALL RIGHT.

20:13.813 --> 20:16.746
(sighs)
I WANT OUR WEDDING NIGHT

20:16.746 --> 20:18.618
TO BE AMAZING.

20:18.618 --> 20:19.619
SO DO I.

20:19.619 --> 20:20.950
AND I WANT OUR FIRST TIME
TO BE--

20:20.950 --> 20:22.352
AND THAT'S THE THING.

20:22.352 --> 20:26.856
UH, IT WILL BE
THE FIRST TIME... FOR ME.

20:26.856 --> 20:30.560
I-I JUST--I WANT IT
TO BE RIGHT.

20:30.560 --> 20:31.701
BEFORE WE HAVE SEX,

20:31.701 --> 20:33.733
I WANT US TO COMMIT
TO ONE ANOTHER

20:33.733 --> 20:35.234
IN THE PRESENCE
OF GOD AND--

20:35.234 --> 20:36.736
SHH.

20:36.736 --> 20:37.767
APRIL...

20:37.767 --> 20:39.809
OH.

20:39.809 --> 20:40.870
I LOVE YOU.

20:40.870 --> 20:42.442
YEAH.

20:42.442 --> 20:45.244
AND I AM GOING TO LOVE YOU
THE REST OF MY LIFE.

20:45.244 --> 20:48.418
AND I THINK THAT GOD
KNOWS THAT.

20:48.418 --> 20:51.851
I THINK HE KNOWS
HOW WE FEEL.

20:51.851 --> 20:53.683
(whispers) OR SHE.

20:53.683 --> 20:57.327
(chuckles) OR SHE.

20:57.327 --> 21:00.860
WELL...

21:00.860 --> 21:05.034
REVEREND DREW DID SAY
THAT WE SHOULD... SUPPORT...

21:05.034 --> 21:06.436
ONE ANOTHER.

21:06.436 --> 21:10.370
SO, IF--IF THIS IS
REALLY IMPORTANT TO YOU.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.802
IT IS REALLY, REALLY
IMPORTANT TO ME.
REALLY?

21:12.802 --> 21:15.345
(sighs)

21:15.345 --> 21:17.447
(inhales deeply)
OKAY.

21:17.447 --> 21:19.809
OKAY?

21:19.809 --> 21:21.811
MM-HMM. (giggles)

21:21.811 --> 21:23.012
(instrument whirring)

21:23.012 --> 21:25.585
HEY, THOSE ADHESIONS ARE STUCK
TO THE INTESTINES.

21:25.585 --> 21:28.658
SO MAKE SURE YOU'RE ON
THE RIGHT PLANE OF DISSECTION.

21:28.658 --> 21:30.820
THINK I'M FINALLY
GETTING THROUGH--

21:30.820 --> 21:31.891
DAH! CAREFUL!

21:31.891 --> 21:34.664
WILSON, IF YOU CUT THE BOWEL
INSTEAD OF THE ADHESION,

21:34.664 --> 21:35.725
THERE'LL BE SPILLAGE,

21:35.725 --> 21:38.468
ALL OVER THE MAN'S
ABDOMINAL CAVITY.
RIGHT.

21:38.468 --> 21:40.800
YOU KNOW, JUST...
JUST LET ME DO IT.

21:42.472 --> 21:45.705
(muttering)

21:45.705 --> 21:47.607
(Jo) DR. BAILEY!

21:47.607 --> 21:49.779
I NEED TO FEEL THE TISSUE
MYSELF.
DR. BAILEY!

21:49.779 --> 21:51.381
WHAT?
SPILLAGE.

21:51.381 --> 21:53.082
(alarm blaring)

21:53.082 --> 21:54.313
IRRIGATION.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.785
(warped sound)

21:55.785 --> 21:56.716
(muffled voice) DR. BAILEY.

21:56.716 --> 21:59.389
DR. BAILEY.
(alarm continues blaring)

21:59.389 --> 22:00.750
(muffled voice) MIRANDA.

22:00.750 --> 22:03.593
MORE IRRIGATION.

22:03.593 --> 22:04.654
DR. BAILEY!

22:04.654 --> 22:05.695
MIRANDA.

22:05.695 --> 22:08.558
(warped sound)
IRRIGATION, NOW.

22:08.558 --> 22:11.631
(alarm continues blaring)

22:15.064 --> 22:16.105
WE NEED TO COMPLETELY
WASH OUT THE ABDOMEN.

22:16.105 --> 22:17.036
DID YOU COMPLETELY
WASH IT OUT?

22:17.036 --> 22:18.468
I HAVE SEVERAL TIMES.

22:18.468 --> 22:19.969
I DON'T SEE ANY STOOL
OR CONTAMINATION.

22:19.969 --> 22:21.340
AND WE NEED TO
GET IT CLOSED, A.S.A.P.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.714
THE HOLE CAN CAUSE SEPSIS,
WHICH COULD DROP BLOOD PRESSURE.

22:24.714 --> 22:26.045
(Ben) VITALS ARE STEADY.
WE'RE FINE.

22:26.045 --> 22:28.648
(monitor beeping)

22:28.648 --> 22:30.680
WE STILL HAVE
ALL THE ANASTOMOSES.

22:30.680 --> 22:32.622
JUST CONCENTRATE ON
ONE THING AT A TIME.

22:32.622 --> 22:33.883
WE FIX THE HOLE.

22:33.883 --> 22:35.354
THEN WE MOVE ON
TO THE NEXT STEP.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.986
IT'S JUST
A ROUTINE COMPLICATION.

22:36.986 --> 22:39.028
THAT HAPPENS.

22:39.028 --> 22:42.892
EVERYTHING'S UNDER CONTROL.
WE'RE GOOD.

22:42.892 --> 22:45.134
YOU GOOD, MIRANDA?

22:45.134 --> 22:46.536
(monitor beeping)

22:46.536 --> 22:51.040
(ventilator whirring)

22:51.040 --> 22:53.773
3-0 VICRYL.

22:53.773 --> 22:55.074
(sighs)

22:55.074 --> 22:57.607
(machine whirring)

22:57.607 --> 22:58.908
HI.

22:58.908 --> 22:59.949
HEY.

22:59.949 --> 23:02.081
(whirring)

23:02.081 --> 23:05.014
ARE ALL THE MATERIALS
BIOCOMPATIBLE?

23:05.014 --> 23:06.556
DEPENDS ON THE CARTRIDGE.

23:06.556 --> 23:08.117
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU, LIKE...

23:08.117 --> 23:09.719
YOU KNOW, PAUSE IT?

23:09.719 --> 23:11.060
START SOMETHING ELSE?

23:11.060 --> 23:15.394
YOU'D BE STUCK WITH
A HUNK OF JUNK.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.896
AND THEN DR. GREY WOULD HAVE
TO START OVER,

23:16.896 --> 23:20.099
SENDING HER BACK A WHOLE DAY
IN HER RESEARCH,

23:20.099 --> 23:22.401
RESULTING IN HER DESIRE
TO MURDER ME.

23:22.401 --> 23:23.733
HMM.

23:25.575 --> 23:27.637
(folder closes)

23:27.637 --> 23:29.108
GREAT.

23:32.111 --> 23:35.585
VERTEBRAL ARTERY
IS TORTUOUS.

23:35.585 --> 23:37.647
SEE, IT'S COMPRESSING
THE FACIAL NERVE

23:37.647 --> 23:39.048
WHICH IS THE SOURCE
OF THE TWITCH.

23:39.048 --> 23:40.089
YEAH.

23:40.089 --> 23:42.021
YOU WANNA DO
THE DECOMPRESSION?

23:42.021 --> 23:44.153
HELL, YEAH.

23:46.095 --> 23:47.126
DR. AVERY?

23:47.126 --> 23:48.598
TRAUMA'S ASKING IF WE CAN
TAKE A LOOK

23:48.598 --> 23:50.760
AT A HUGE FACIAL LAC
IN THE I.C.U.

23:50.760 --> 23:52.131
SHOULD I DO THE SUTURES?

23:52.131 --> 23:53.202
NO, DEFINITELY NOT.

23:53.202 --> 23:54.203
I CAN HANDLE IT.

23:54.203 --> 23:55.635
SERIOUSLY.

23:55.635 --> 23:56.836
SERIOUSLY, I'LL BE THERE
IN AN HOUR.

23:56.836 --> 23:58.638
THANK YOU.

24:02.972 --> 24:04.944
MURPHY'S NOT BAD,
YOU KNOW.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.115
OH, I KNOW.

24:06.115 --> 24:07.517
IT'S JUST THAT I'M BETTER.

24:07.517 --> 24:10.079
CAN I HAVE A PLEDGET,
PLEASE?

24:10.079 --> 24:11.050
THANK YOU.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.922
PUT IT TO THE LEFT,
DUMBASS.

24:12.922 --> 24:16.085
WHAT?
ARE YOU A HALF-WIT?

24:16.085 --> 24:19.158
I SAID PLACE IT
TO THE LEFT, IDIOT.

24:19.158 --> 24:20.730
THOSE ARE THINGS
MARK SLOAN USED TO SAY

24:20.730 --> 24:22.191
WHEN HE THOUGHT HE WAS
BETTER THAN YOU.

24:22.191 --> 24:23.633
ARE WE TAKING A WALK DOWN
MEMORY LANE NOW?

24:23.633 --> 24:25.635
YOU KNOW, I CONVINCED HIM
TO START TEACHING YOU.

24:25.635 --> 24:26.966
YOU'RE A FULL-WIT.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.538
NOW YOU HAVE TO START
TEACHING THE RESIDENTS,

24:28.538 --> 24:30.039
HAND THEM THE KEYS.

24:30.039 --> 24:31.571
AND LET THEM TAKE IT
ON A JOYRIDE?

24:31.571 --> 24:33.142
I DON'T THINK SO.

24:33.142 --> 24:34.974
WELL, PRETTY SOON THEY'RE GONNA
BE 18 AND HAVE THEIR OWN CARS.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.245
LET'S TEACH 'EM
BEFORE THEY GET THERE.

24:36.245 --> 24:39.178
ALL RIGHT, SECURING THE PAD
WITH FIBRIN GLUE.

24:39.178 --> 24:41.180
YOU'RE GONNA NEED A LOT
OF THAT, ASSHAT.

24:41.180 --> 24:43.082
(chuckles) ALL RIGHT, I GET IT.
POINT MADE.

24:43.082 --> 24:44.914
I KNOW.
IT'S JUST SO FUN.

24:44.914 --> 24:46.586
(chuckles)

24:46.586 --> 24:49.088
THERE SHE IS.
NUMBER EIGHT.

24:49.088 --> 24:50.520
(Meredith sighs)

24:50.520 --> 24:52.221
(Meredith) RIGHT SMACK
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LIVER.

24:52.221 --> 24:53.793
LET'S SKIP IT.

24:53.793 --> 24:55.665
SKIP IT?
WHY WOULD WE DO THAT?

24:55.665 --> 24:56.726
WE'LL COME BACK TO IT.

24:56.726 --> 24:58.127
NO, WE PLANNED THIS SURGERY
IN AN ORDER.

24:58.127 --> 24:59.128
WE SHOULD STICK TO IT.

24:59.128 --> 25:01.100
ALEX, IF WE REMOVE
THE OTHER ONES FIRST,

25:01.100 --> 25:03.773
WE'LL HAVE BETTER EXPOSURE.
LET'S JUST COME BACK TO IT.

25:03.773 --> 25:04.834
IT'S THE HARDEST ONE.

25:04.834 --> 25:06.175
IF IT TURNS OUT WE CAN'T
REMOVE IT,

25:06.175 --> 25:07.577
WHAT'S THE POINT OF EVEN
GOING FOR THE EASY ONES?

25:07.577 --> 25:08.678
LOOK, WE SHOULD TRY--

25:08.678 --> 25:10.039
I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,

25:10.039 --> 25:11.841
BUT I'M THE LEAD SURGEON
ON THIS,

25:11.841 --> 25:13.512
AND I'M MAKING THE CALL.

25:13.512 --> 25:16.586
LET'S GO TO NUMBER NINE.

25:16.586 --> 25:17.887
DR. YANG!

25:17.887 --> 25:19.218
P.I.C.U. JUST PAGED.

25:19.218 --> 25:20.990
NATHAN'S DEFINITELY IN
FULL-BLOWN REJECTION.

25:20.990 --> 25:22.121
I DID IT.
DID WHAT?

25:22.121 --> 25:24.053
I SPOKE TO THE F.D.A.,
FILLED OUT THE RELEASE,

25:24.053 --> 25:25.254
I JUST NEED YOU
TO SIGN IT...

25:25.254 --> 25:27.056
ROSS.
BEFORE THEY CAN START
REVIEWING IT.

25:27.056 --> 25:28.928
WE'RE NOT GONNA DO IT.
CALL THEM BACK.

25:28.928 --> 25:30.259
YOU SAID YOU'D CONSIDER IT
IF I COVERED THE OBSTACLES.

25:30.259 --> 25:33.102
THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS.
SAFER OPTIONS.

25:33.102 --> 25:35.034
WE CAN INCREASE
HIS I.V. STEROIDS,

25:35.034 --> 25:37.066
START PROGRAF--
NO!

25:37.066 --> 25:40.169
NONE OF THOSE ARE AS GOOD
AS A BIOLOGICAL CONDUIT.

25:40.169 --> 25:42.271
I HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION.
WE HAVE THE PRINTER.

25:42.271 --> 25:43.613
ROSS.

25:43.613 --> 25:45.915
IT'S NOT OUR PRINTER.

25:45.915 --> 25:47.546
IT'S DR. GREY'S PRINTER,

25:47.546 --> 25:48.978
AND SHE IS USING IT
TO PRINT NOW.

25:48.978 --> 25:51.080
SO WE CAN'T DO IT.

25:51.080 --> 25:53.122
I'M SORRY.

25:58.327 --> 26:00.930
...THEN I PAN-SEAR THEM
FOR A FEW MINUTES

26:00.930 --> 26:03.192
ON BOTH SIDES UNTIL
THEY'RE BROWN.

26:03.192 --> 26:04.694
AND?

26:04.694 --> 26:08.297
AND THAT'S HOW I MAKE
MY FAMOUS MEATBALLS.

26:08.297 --> 26:11.200
THAT'S NOT A STORY.
THAT'S A RECIPE.

26:11.200 --> 26:15.344
AT LEAST IT GOT YOU TO SHUT
YOUR YAP FOR A HOT MINUTE.

26:15.344 --> 26:17.146
EH, IT'S USEFUL.

26:17.146 --> 26:21.150
UH, YOU KNOW, UH, BESIDES,
IT'S BETTER THAN YOU

26:21.150 --> 26:23.312
SPEAKING ABOUT--
(walker clatters, thud)

26:23.312 --> 26:26.315
C.J.?

26:30.820 --> 26:33.893
C.J.?

26:33.893 --> 26:39.098
(groans)

26:39.098 --> 26:40.229
MM, OKAY.

26:40.229 --> 26:44.303
(clears throat) C.J.?

26:44.303 --> 26:46.035
C.J.--

26:46.035 --> 26:47.677
C.J.!

26:49.809 --> 26:51.681
C.J.! I NEED SOME HELP!

26:51.681 --> 26:53.042
C.J.
DR. WEBBER?

26:53.042 --> 26:54.243
LET ME TAKE OVER--
OKAY, OKAY, I GOT THIS.

26:54.243 --> 26:55.885
KEPNER,
GET A CRASH CART.

26:55.885 --> 26:58.387
OKAY, GET ME ONE OF EPI
AND 300 OF AMIODARONE, NOW!

26:58.387 --> 27:00.089
(woman) ON IT.

27:00.089 --> 27:01.190
(man over P.A.)
CODE BLUE, THIRD FLOOR.

27:01.190 --> 27:03.122
COME ON, C.J.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.655
CODE BLUE, THIRD FLOOR.

27:09.859 --> 27:11.000
CALLIE LOVED YOU.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.131
SHE'S VERY NICE.

27:12.131 --> 27:14.003
VERY THOROUGH,
BUT VERY NICE.

27:14.003 --> 27:15.935
HOW LONG HAVE YOU TWO
BEEN DIVORCED?

27:15.935 --> 27:19.869
UM, WELL, I DON'T--
I DON'T THINK THAT WE ARE.

27:19.869 --> 27:21.911
W-WE'RE SORT OF SEPARATED,
I-I GUESS.

27:21.911 --> 27:23.242
AH, YOU STILL
HAVE THE RING.

27:23.242 --> 27:25.875
BUT YOU'RE SEEING
OTHER PEOPLE, OBVIOUSLY.

27:25.875 --> 27:28.848
UM, YEAH. WE ARE.

27:28.848 --> 27:31.350
I'M SO SORRY.
THAT WAS WAY TOO PERSONAL.

27:31.350 --> 27:34.023
I JUST OUT OF A JOB INTERVIEW
THAT WAS MORE INTIMATE

27:34.023 --> 27:36.125
THAN MOST RECTAL EXAMS.
(chuckles)

27:36.125 --> 27:37.757
I'M JUST NOT USED TO IT.

27:37.757 --> 27:40.990
UH, WE DON'T DO THINGS
LIKE THIS AT SEATTLE PRES.

27:40.990 --> 27:42.191
WELL, THEN, COME WORK HERE.

27:42.191 --> 27:44.734
BECAUSE WE DO WAY TOO PERSONAL
ON A DAILY BASIS.

27:44.734 --> 27:45.965
(elevator bell dings)

27:45.965 --> 27:48.297
WE'LL ISOLATE THE VESSELS,
THEN TAKE THE TUMOR OUT

27:48.297 --> 27:49.338
UNDER DIRECT VISION.

27:49.338 --> 27:50.399
I CAN DO IT.

27:50.399 --> 27:52.041
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN,
MER.

27:52.041 --> 27:53.202
IT MIGHT BE BETTER JUST
TO CLOSE HIM.

27:53.202 --> 27:55.144
WELL, IF WE DON'T RESECT IT,
THE CANCER WILL ONLY SPREAD,

27:55.144 --> 27:57.406
AND IT'LL ELIMINATE HIS CHANCES
OF BEATING THIS THING.

27:57.406 --> 27:59.148
HOW DO YOU GET IT WITHOUT
TAKING THE ENTIRE LIVER?

27:59.148 --> 28:00.679
DR. GREY,

28:00.679 --> 28:01.911
I JUST WANTED TO SHOW YOU
THE LATEST ON THE LIVER MODEL.

28:01.911 --> 28:03.052
NOT NOW.

28:03.052 --> 28:04.053
EDWARDS, SCRUB IN.

28:04.053 --> 28:06.385
WE'RE GONNA NEED
YOUR HELP RETRACTING.

28:06.385 --> 28:08.317
ALEX, HE'S 15.

28:08.317 --> 28:11.120
I THINK WE NEED TO BE
AS AGGRESSIVE AS WE CAN.

28:11.120 --> 28:13.092
CLAMP.

28:16.826 --> 28:18.868
THAT'S THE LAST OF
THE RECONSTRUCTION, RIGHT?

28:18.868 --> 28:21.330
THAT'S RIGHT. BEN, CAN WE GET
A METHYLENE BLUE TEST?

28:21.330 --> 28:22.772
COMING RIGHT UP.

28:22.772 --> 28:24.133
WILSON, WATCH CLOSELY.
IF THERE'S BLUE--

28:24.133 --> 28:25.935
THERE'S A LEAK, ON IT.

28:27.737 --> 28:28.978
NO BLUE.

28:28.978 --> 28:30.940
NICE WORK, YOU GUYS.

28:30.940 --> 28:32.441
(suction gurgling)

28:32.441 --> 28:35.745
LET'S ALSO GET
A BUBBLE TEST.

28:35.745 --> 28:37.216
DO WE NEED BOTH?

28:37.216 --> 28:40.790
WE NEED TO BE ABSOLUTELY SURE
THAT THERE'S NO LEAK.

28:40.790 --> 28:44.854
IF THERE'S A BREAKDOWN
SOMEWHERE IN THE ANASTOMOSIS,

28:44.854 --> 28:48.057
THEN BACTERIA CAN SEEP THROUGH,
GOING GOD KNOWS WHERE,

28:48.057 --> 28:50.359
CAUSING A POTENTIAL
FATAL INFECTION.

28:50.359 --> 28:52.932
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT
FOR THE PATIENT, WILSON?

28:52.932 --> 28:54.804
NO, MA'AM.

28:54.804 --> 28:57.366
YOU KNOW, BUBBLE TEST
ONLY TAKES A SECOND.

28:57.366 --> 29:00.810
SO, UH, WILSON, AS I INJECT
AIR INTO THE N.G. TUBE,

29:00.810 --> 29:02.972
SUBMERGE HIS CHEST
WITH SALINE.

29:02.972 --> 29:04.273
OKAY.

29:09.148 --> 29:13.252
NO BUBBLE.
SHOULD WE START TO CLOSE?

29:13.252 --> 29:16.025
(warped sound)

29:16.025 --> 29:17.857
(breathing heavily)

29:17.857 --> 29:21.130
(water dripping)

29:21.130 --> 29:22.431
WE'RE NOT CLOSING.
THERE'S A LEAK.

29:22.431 --> 29:24.033
THERE'S A LEAK.

29:24.033 --> 29:26.135
I SEE A SMALL BUBBLE,
SO THERE'S A LEAK.

29:26.135 --> 29:27.296
WE'LL PATCH IT.

29:27.296 --> 29:30.239
A BUBBLE?
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.
IT'S THERE.

29:30.239 --> 29:33.072
DR. WARREN?

29:33.072 --> 29:37.446
UM, YOU KNOW, I...

29:37.446 --> 29:39.548
DIDN'T HAVE A VERY GOOD ANGLE
FROM OVER HERE,

29:39.548 --> 29:42.281
BUT I TRUST DR. BAILEY
IF SHE SAW A BUBBLE.

29:42.281 --> 29:46.055
MIGHT AS WELL PUT A PATCH ON
TO BE SAFE.

29:46.055 --> 29:48.787
WE'LL OVERSEW IT
AND COVER IT WITH A MUSCLE FLAP.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.319
SUCTION. SCISSORS.

29:54.924 --> 29:57.066
UH, HARVEY,
ARE--ARE YOU OKAY?

29:57.066 --> 29:58.928
I'M WAITING FOR IT
TO TWITCH.

29:58.928 --> 30:00.229
IT'S TWITCHED FOR 20 YEARS.

30:00.229 --> 30:04.003
YOU CAN WAIT ALL YOU WANT,
BUT IT'S GONE. WE GOT IT.

30:04.003 --> 30:05.935
THANK YOU.

30:05.935 --> 30:07.106
WHO DO YOU WANNA
SEE FIRST?

30:07.106 --> 30:08.307
THE FACIAL LAC
OR MRS. MADDOX?

30:08.307 --> 30:09.308
I'LL TAKE 'EM BOTH.

30:09.308 --> 30:10.980
(mouths word)

30:10.980 --> 30:12.311
(elevator bell dings)

30:12.311 --> 30:15.314
OKAY, I WILL TAKE
MRS. MADDOX,

30:15.314 --> 30:17.416
AND YOU CAN TAKE
THE FACIAL LAC.

30:17.416 --> 30:18.918
(clears throat)

30:18.918 --> 30:21.350
YOU KNOW WHAT? WHY DON'T--
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE 'EM BOTH?

30:21.350 --> 30:25.124
DR. AVERY, I WILL NOT
DISAPPOINT YOU.

30:25.124 --> 30:26.956
REALLY?

30:31.961 --> 30:33.302
HOW YOU HOLDING UP?

30:33.302 --> 30:35.834
I'M EXHAUSTED.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.566
YOU SHOULD'VE LET ME
DO THE C.P.R.

30:37.566 --> 30:43.072
NO, NO,
IT'S A... GOOD EXHAUSTED.

30:43.072 --> 30:46.215
I'VE BEEN STUCK
IN THIS BED,

30:46.215 --> 30:50.619
REMINISCING ABOUT
MY OLD LIFE,

30:50.619 --> 30:55.454
TRYING TO FEEL
LIKE MY--MYSELF AGAIN.

30:55.454 --> 31:00.189
AND NOW I WANNA BE MYSELF
AGAIN.

31:00.189 --> 31:05.394
READY TO GET BACK
TO MY FEET AND...

31:05.394 --> 31:09.168
BE THE DOCTOR I USED TO BE.

31:09.168 --> 31:11.070
(sighs)

31:11.070 --> 31:17.206
I LOST MYSELF THERE
FOR A WHILE, KEPNER.

31:17.206 --> 31:21.350
BUT NOW I'M READY
TO GET MYSELF BACK.

31:26.015 --> 31:28.587
(monitor beeping steadily,
heartbeat whooshing)

31:28.587 --> 31:30.319
HE'S IN
FLORID HEART FAILURE.

31:30.319 --> 31:33.592
HIS E.F. IS FALLING
PRECIPITOUSLY.

31:33.592 --> 31:36.065
IT'S THE HOSPITAL'S PRINTER.

31:36.065 --> 31:38.327
YOU TAUGHT ME TO TAKE
WHAT I NEED FOR MY PATIENT.

31:38.327 --> 31:42.101
WE CAN'T.
NOT THIS TIME.

31:42.101 --> 31:45.304
I LOOKED AT DR. GREY'S RESEARCH.
SHE STILL HAS MONTHS TO GO

31:45.304 --> 31:47.136
BEFORE PRINTING A PORTAL VEIN
THAT WILL ACTUALLY GO

31:47.136 --> 31:49.078
INTO A HUMAN PATIENT.

31:49.078 --> 31:52.481
BUT THIS? BUILDING A SCAFFOLD
SEATED WITH CELLS,

31:52.481 --> 31:55.644
WE CAN DO THIS.
THIS BABY CAN BE SAVED TODAY.

31:55.644 --> 31:58.087
I KNOW, SHANE.
YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW THIS?

31:59.548 --> 32:01.290
NOW SET UP FOR
A PERICARDIOCENTESIS

32:01.290 --> 32:04.393
AND DO A REPEAT ECHO
IN AN HOUR.

32:04.393 --> 32:06.195
(Alex) MER,
YOU HAVE TO STOP NOW.

32:06.195 --> 32:08.157
I'M ABOUT TO DO
THE TRISEGMENTECTOMY--

32:08.157 --> 32:09.228
ANY FURTHER,
YOU'RE GONNA MOVE INTO

32:09.228 --> 32:10.429
SEGMENT TWO AND THREE.

32:10.429 --> 32:11.560
AND IT WILL BE FINE!
THERE WON'T BE ENOUGH

32:11.560 --> 32:13.132
FUNCTIONING LIVER
TO SUPPORT THIS KID.

32:13.132 --> 32:15.564
I THINK IT WILL, AND I WILL STOP
BEFORE I'M TOO DEEP.

32:15.564 --> 32:17.006
YOU PRINT ONE DAMN FORK,
AND NOW YOU THINK

32:17.006 --> 32:18.437
YOU'RE MOSES OR SOMETHING.

32:18.437 --> 32:21.010
ALEX, I AM IN THE MIDDLE
OF DIVIDING THIS KID'S LIVER.

32:21.010 --> 32:23.042
AND I NEED THIS CONVERSATION
TO BE OVER!

32:23.042 --> 32:24.443
OH, YOU GONNA PULL RANK
ON ME AGAIN?

32:24.443 --> 32:25.674
IS THAT HOW
THE DECISION'S MADE?

32:25.674 --> 32:27.046
YOU COULD 2-CHALLENGE RULE.
WHAT?

32:27.046 --> 32:29.118
DR. WEBBER TOLD US
ABOUT THE 2-CHALLENGE RULE

32:29.118 --> 32:31.020
WHERE TWO SURGEONS WHO AGREE
CAN FORCE A THIRD SURGEON

32:31.020 --> 32:32.581
TO STAND DOWN
FROM A COURSE OF ACTION.

32:32.581 --> 32:33.722
OKAY, FINE.

32:33.722 --> 32:35.985
SO, DR. EDWARDS,
YOU AND I CHALLENGE

32:35.985 --> 32:39.088
DR. KAREV TO RELAX
AND LET ME FINISH.

32:39.088 --> 32:41.090
NO, I'M CHALLENGING YOU,
MER.

32:41.090 --> 32:42.961
I'M ASKING YOU
TO STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

32:42.961 --> 32:44.063
EDWARDS?

32:44.063 --> 32:48.467
DR. GREY...
I THINK YOU'RE AMAZING.

32:48.467 --> 32:50.069
AND YOU MADE A BEAUTIFUL FORK,

32:50.069 --> 32:52.701
AND I AM SO GRATEFUL
TO HAVE BEEN A PART OF THAT.

32:52.701 --> 32:55.104
BUT RIGHT NOW
I DO THINK YOU'RE PUSHING IT.

32:55.104 --> 32:58.107
AND I HAVE TO SECOND
DR. KAREV'S CHALLENGE.

32:59.108 --> 33:01.610
DR. KAREV,
YOU CAN CLOSE.

33:01.610 --> 33:04.083
(instruments clatter)

33:10.159 --> 33:13.692
(sirens wailing in distance)

33:13.692 --> 33:17.226
SO ROBBINS SAYS
EVERYBODY LOVES YOU.

33:17.226 --> 33:19.068
I CAN'T WORK HERE.
WHAT?

33:19.068 --> 33:22.071
THESE PEOPLE ARE GREAT.
THEY'RE INCREDIBLY NICE

33:22.071 --> 33:27.276
AND OVERLY KIND
AND A LITTLE NOSY, BUT GREAT.

33:27.276 --> 33:30.709
BUT THEY'RE YOUR PEOPLE,
AND THEY LOVE YOU.

33:30.709 --> 33:32.711
AND THEY CARE ABOUT YOU.

33:32.711 --> 33:34.643
