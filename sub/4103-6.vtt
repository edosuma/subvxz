00:08.100 --> 00:09.590
Audrey:
Previously
on
sc rea m. . .

00:09.610 --> 00:10.668
I talked to rachel's parents

00:10.670 --> 00:12.809
And they said that
audrey intimidated rachel.

00:12.810 --> 00:15.074
And that she could
get her to do things

00:15.080 --> 00:16.900
That she wou/dn ’t normally do.

00:16.910 --> 00:18.707
(screaming)

00:18.980 --> 00:20.572
We're gonna figure
this out, i promise.

00:20.580 --> 00:22.514
You think the killer
is still out there.

00:22.520 --> 00:24.317
"the truth lies where
the mask was made."

00:24.320 --> 00:28.711
The mask brandon james wore
was actually a surgical mask.

00:29.060 --> 00:29.856
(all screaming)

00:29.860 --> 00:31.987
Sheriff, this is
detective lorraine brock.

00:31.990 --> 00:36.051
Am i being fired?
Just a temporary
leave of absence.

00:36.070 --> 00:37.458
We're on for tomorrow.

00:37.470 --> 00:38.664
Jake: .
77'me to get pa/d.

00:38.670 --> 00:41.138
W/7/:
What the he// was that?
No one was supposed
to get hurt.

00:41.140 --> 00:42.994
Jake:
I’m the one who
took a// the risk!

00:43.010 --> 00:44.932
You should he thanking me!

00:44.940 --> 00:45.804
(groaning)

00:45.810 --> 00:46.959
I am done trying to help you!

00:46.980 --> 00:49.676
What is going on?
Your mother's
not at the ashram.

00:49.680 --> 00:52.171
Where is she?
I checked her into rehab.

00:52.180 --> 00:53.306
Will had a video...

00:53.320 --> 00:56.118
Of your dad doing things
he should not have been doing.

00:56.120 --> 00:58.588
That's the day
after my mom left.

00:58.590 --> 00:59.841
Oh, my god.

00:59.860 --> 01:01.213
My life is not a game.

01:01.220 --> 01:02.118
/(/7/er.'.
Yes, It Is.

01:02.120 --> 01:04.554
And when i say it’s over,
you lose.

01:04.560 --> 01:06.425
He's not gonna win.

01:26.950 --> 01:28.577
So, that happened.

01:29.150 --> 01:31.015
You okay with that?

01:31.390 --> 01:33.779
I'm more than okay with that.

01:49.210 --> 01:51.132
Where are you going?

01:51.340 --> 01:53.160
It's not even dawn yet.

01:53.180 --> 01:55.034
Take me to brandon's house.

01:55.240 --> 01:58.004
I wanna face my
fears right now.

02:28.680 --> 02:29.931
You still sure about this?

02:29.950 --> 02:32.475
The idea's losing
its appeal, but...

02:32.680 --> 02:34.477
We're here, so...

02:39.720 --> 02:41.984
(door creaking)

03:08.680 --> 03:10.375
Emma: A fresh daisy?

03:13.160 --> 03:14.718
(gasping)

03:17.230 --> 03:18.788
He's been here.

03:19.460 --> 03:22.054
It's okay, just keep going.

03:23.500 --> 03:25.297
I got your back.

03:29.270 --> 03:31.363
(emma breathing heavily)

03:48.960 --> 03:50.552
Oh, my god.

03:50.990 --> 03:53.026
This is where it all started.

03:53.030 --> 03:54.725
(floorboard creaks)

03:54.730 --> 03:56.049
Kieran?

04:00.200 --> 04:01.736
Kieran?

04:02.340 --> 04:04.069
(phone ringing)

04:09.380 --> 04:11.348
/(/ller.'
Hello, emma.

04:11.680 --> 04:12.942
What did you do?

04:12.950 --> 04:13.700
Don ’t you know?

04:13.720 --> 04:16.917
(gasping)
please don't hurt him.

04:16.920 --> 04:18.888
(chuck/es)
oh,
sweet, naive emma.

04:18.890 --> 04:23.054
He even made you think it
was your idea to come here.

04:23.390 --> 04:24.880
(gasps)

04:27.900 --> 04:29.458
(panﬁng)

04:35.470 --> 04:36.789
(grunts)

04:41.780 --> 04:43.736
(whimpering)

04:43.750 --> 04:45.900
(breathing heavily)

04:51.750 --> 04:54.480
It ends with you.

05:12.370 --> 05:14.679
Oh. I'm sorry.

05:14.880 --> 05:15.869
Emma.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.074
You're up early.

05:17.080 --> 05:18.479
Good morning, sheriff.

05:18.480 --> 05:19.469
Emma, uh...

05:19.480 --> 05:21.971
I was just dropping
off some... Those files.

05:21.980 --> 05:24.244
I was just...
I'm leaving. (sighs)

05:24.250 --> 05:26.241
See you later.
Bye.

05:26.460 --> 05:27.916
See ya.

05:29.930 --> 05:30.658
Uh, so, um...

05:30.660 --> 05:32.924
(clears throat)
did you get some sleep?

05:32.930 --> 05:34.454
Uh, yeah.

05:34.460 --> 05:36.394
More than you, i'm betting.

05:36.400 --> 05:37.424
(sighs)

05:37.430 --> 05:38.169
Mom, it's fine.

05:38.170 --> 05:40.764
I was the one who told you
to go for it, remember?

05:40.770 --> 05:41.839
Yeah.

05:41.840 --> 05:44.764
Hey, i'm happy
that you're happy.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.301
Thanks.

05:47.040 --> 05:49.133
Happy feels good.

05:52.480 --> 05:53.674
Hmm.

05:53.680 --> 05:55.773
(indistinct chatter)

05:56.620 --> 05:59.839
Uh, it's piper, right?

06:00.090 --> 06:01.682
Will belmont.

06:01.890 --> 06:04.450
Are you hoping
to run into emma?

06:05.430 --> 06:06.727
(sighs)

06:06.730 --> 06:07.526
It's that obvious, huh?

06:07.530 --> 06:11.864
I witnessed firsthand that
dangerous l/a/sons
_ video _
landing on your girl.

06:11.870 --> 06:15.192
And that's gonna be a tough
one to come back from.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.668
But, not impossible?

06:17.670 --> 06:19.501
See, the problem with
being a nice guy

06:19.510 --> 06:22.308
Is that screw-ups look
so much worse on you

06:22.310 --> 06:24.278
Because you're decent.

06:24.550 --> 06:25.403
Like, nina was a bitch.

06:25.410 --> 06:28.004
Nobody expected
anything better from her.

06:28.020 --> 06:29.908
And i hear that she

06:29.920 --> 06:33.481
Talked you into doing some
things that were kind of

06:33.490 --> 06:35.879
Out of your comfort zone.

06:36.260 --> 06:38.387
(sighs) um...

06:39.700 --> 06:41.122
She had a way.

06:41.730 --> 06:43.823
Maybe we can help each other.

06:43.830 --> 06:45.889
I need to know more
about nina.

06:45.900 --> 06:47.424
You should come on my podcast,

06:47.440 --> 06:49.761
Tell me all the stuff that
nina was doing

06:49.770 --> 06:51.294
And own your part.

06:51.310 --> 06:53.266
Take responsibility.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.408
Everybody loves
a redemption story.

06:57.580 --> 07:00.071
Noah: He is definitely
hiding something.

07:00.080 --> 07:02.469
I did some digging into
"mr. Seth branson."

07:02.480 --> 07:04.710
You know what i found?
He doesn't exist?

07:04.720 --> 07:05.584
No. Come on. Uh, it's 2015.

07:05.590 --> 07:10.789
I found four guys, none
of whom are our mr. Branson.

07:11.360 --> 07:12.156
That's damning, how?

07:12.160 --> 07:15.755
This mr. Branson didn't exist
until he moved to lakewood.

07:15.760 --> 07:17.398
You don't change your name
unless you've got a secret.

07:17.400 --> 07:21.325
Like trolling teens
through their webcams
to find a victim.

07:21.340 --> 07:21.863
Exactly.

07:21.870 --> 07:23.565
Cops turn themselves
inside out

07:23.570 --> 07:24.594
Searching for
logical suspects,

07:24.610 --> 07:28.774
But we could just be looking
at your garden-variety
psychopath.

07:28.780 --> 07:30.475
Branson as ma nson?

07:30.680 --> 07:32.568
I don't buy it.
Yeah, well...

07:32.580 --> 07:33.899
Neither did the victims
of the btk killer

07:33.920 --> 07:36.844
Till they were staring down
the business end
of a boning knife.

07:36.850 --> 07:38.841
I thought he was
your favorite teacher.

07:38.850 --> 07:39.487
He is.

07:39.490 --> 07:42.653
Which is why the possibility
is so alarming.

07:45.160 --> 07:48.755
By another psychopath. Nina.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.098
Nina discovered his secret

07:51.100 --> 07:54.297
And blackmailed him
into planting the malware.

07:54.300 --> 07:54.834
Hmm.

07:54.840 --> 07:58.059
Then anyone she trolled
could have motive.

07:58.070 --> 08:00.834
The guys she slept with...
Hmm.

08:01.310 --> 08:03.198
The guys she didn't.

08:03.410 --> 08:05.549
The girls who envied her,

08:05.550 --> 08:08.769
And the ones who despised her.

08:11.290 --> 08:12.143
That's a long-ass list.

08:12.150 --> 08:15.187
So, pretty much
everybody's a suspect.

08:15.190 --> 08:15.884
Including us.

08:15.890 --> 08:17.357
Wait, where are
you on that list?

08:17.360 --> 08:20.284
Duh. I'm making the list.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.067
Nice resting creep face.

08:25.070 --> 08:27.265
Back at ya.
Oh, thank you.

08:28.170 --> 08:29.728
(both laughing)

08:38.910 --> 08:41.208
(sighs) i can't focus
on
the goodbye girl

08:41.220 --> 08:43.518
When my dad is
d0/ng
gone girl.

08:43.520 --> 08:48.355
Hey, you need to stop
obsessing on that video.

08:49.120 --> 08:51.759
If you really think your dad
put your mom on ice,

08:51.760 --> 08:53.978
Let's just go
check it out at lunch.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.820
You'd really go with me?

08:56.030 --> 08:57.725
What are friends for?

08:58.470 --> 09:02.861
Okay, so,
a three-person scene.

09:02.870 --> 09:07.307
Or maybe audrey should
start with an apology

09:07.310 --> 09:10.677
For that "sweep the leg"
assault you pulled on will?

09:10.680 --> 09:11.874
Unlikely.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.370
No, it's okay.

09:14.020 --> 09:15.271
I had that one coming.

09:15.280 --> 09:16.941
You totally did.

09:20.960 --> 09:22.450
But...

09:23.160 --> 09:26.186
It was sort of a dick move
on my part.

09:26.190 --> 09:26.827
Noah: Aw.

09:26.830 --> 09:31.324
I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful
mutual tolerance.

09:33.970 --> 09:36.234
And then i say...

09:36.240 --> 09:38.765
I don't know, a line of
some sort about something.

09:38.770 --> 09:40.863
(chuckles)
or not.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.934
(scoffs)
my, uh...

09:42.950 --> 09:45.339
_ Dad was out when
I got home last night.

09:45.350 --> 09:47.568
Did you... (chuckles)

09:47.580 --> 09:49.673
Did you manage
not to wake your mom?

09:49.690 --> 09:52.318
Uh, yeah. (chuckles)

09:52.720 --> 09:54.642
Thanks to your dad.

09:54.860 --> 09:56.282
I caught him doing
the walk of shame

09:56.290 --> 09:58.952
Out of_ our front door
this morning.

09:58.960 --> 10:02.657
Did you guys make,
like, some weird
mother-daughter sex bet?

10:02.660 --> 10:07.063
(chuckles) yes.
Yeah, that's actually
exactly what we did.

10:07.070 --> 10:08.435
(chuckles)

10:08.440 --> 10:09.566
What?

10:09.570 --> 10:13.006
I'm just glad
this isn't weird.

10:14.740 --> 10:16.571
Yeah. Me, too.

10:17.910 --> 10:19.878
Maggie: Detective brock?

10:20.150 --> 10:20.900
Doctor duval.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.969
Oh. Could you
close that for me, please?

10:25.820 --> 10:27.981
Thank you for coming in.

10:28.190 --> 10:29.680
Of course.

10:30.390 --> 10:31.618
Not quite sure why i'm here.

10:31.630 --> 10:34.554
Uh, i have a few questions
about the rachel murray case.

10:34.560 --> 10:37.859
I thought maybe you
could shed some light.

10:37.870 --> 10:38.996
I'll do my best.

10:39.000 --> 10:39.659
(paper rustling)

10:39.670 --> 10:41.558
It took a week
to determine that

10:41.570 --> 10:43.959
Rachel murray's
death was suspicious.

10:43.970 --> 10:45.039
Can you tell me why?

10:45.040 --> 10:46.109
Well, she presented
as a suicide,

10:46.110 --> 10:49.978
But her injuries
didn't correspond with
where we found her.

10:50.550 --> 10:54.338
Well, by the time hud opened
a murder investigation,

10:54.350 --> 10:56.011
Two more kids were dead.

10:56.020 --> 10:57.146
That wasn't his fault.

10:57.150 --> 10:57.878
I needed to be sure.

10:57.890 --> 11:02.156
Doctor duval, i know you
want to defend him, but...

11:02.390 --> 11:04.449
We both know that
your opinion is biased.

11:04.460 --> 11:07.384
(scoffs) are you
accusing me of something?

11:07.400 --> 11:08.185
Evidence was missed.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.555
Someone has to be
held accountable.
What evidence?

11:10.570 --> 11:14.461
We found hair fibers and
skin cells at the hospital.

11:14.670 --> 11:16.558
Dna test came in.

11:16.770 --> 11:18.260
Can you confirm the results?

11:18.270 --> 11:20.761
The markers look good
for a match. Who is it?

11:20.780 --> 11:23.999
Someone with clear motive
and opportunity.

11:24.010 --> 11:24.772
And unfortunately,

11:24.780 --> 11:28.841
It's a suspect that was right
in front of you both
this entire time.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.157
Officer: Mr. Branson?

11:35.160 --> 11:37.856
Mr. Branson: May i help you?
Yes, sir, you can.

11:37.860 --> 11:41.318
We have some questions
for one of your students.

11:42.900 --> 11:44.322
Audrey jensen?

11:46.130 --> 11:49.099
Officer 2: We're gonna
need you to come with us.

12:10.560 --> 12:12.255
What the hell could
the cops want with audrey?

12:12.260 --> 12:14.228
I don't know. Maybe they
just wanted to ask her

12:14.230 --> 12:15.151
Some questions about rachel.

12:15.160 --> 12:18.323
That's a phone call.
That's not a perp walk
out of class.

12:18.330 --> 12:20.491
(sighs) mr. Branson.

12:20.500 --> 12:20.989
What?

12:21.000 --> 12:24.197
We found out the webcam
malware came from
his homework server.

12:24.210 --> 12:25.063
And he's using a fake name.

12:25.070 --> 12:29.200
Wait. Mr. Branson brings his
soup to school in a thermos.

12:29.210 --> 12:30.609
Villains have to eat, too.

12:30.610 --> 12:32.009
Kingpin eats. The joker eats.

12:32.010 --> 12:34.149
Bane probably doesn't
because of his mask,

12:34.150 --> 12:36.118
But there's probably some
sort of, like, nutrient...

12:36.120 --> 12:38.213
Hey, noah, can we
focus for one second?

12:38.220 --> 12:38.811
Yes. Sorry.

12:38.820 --> 12:41.857
Well, mr. B may have
seen us on his laptop.

12:41.860 --> 12:43.259
If he thought we
could expose him,

12:43.260 --> 12:46.684
Maybe he found a way to
implicate audrey as payback...

12:46.930 --> 12:48.898
Mr. Branson! Hey! Hi!

12:48.900 --> 12:50.754
Um_...
HI.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.829
Emma and i were just...

12:53.340 --> 12:54.193
Talking scenes.

12:54.200 --> 12:55.997
Well, that's actually what
i wanted to discuss.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.163
And considering your
propensity for speeches,

12:59.170 --> 12:59.966
I'm thinking monologue.

12:59.980 --> 13:04.132
Oh, i don't know.
I'm kinda shy.

13:04.350 --> 13:05.374
Let me show you some options.

13:05.380 --> 13:07.848
Oh. Uh, sure, okay.

13:07.850 --> 13:08.976
(inhaling) bye.

13:08.980 --> 13:12.017
After you.
Thank you.

13:21.230 --> 13:24.893
Audrey, we just have
a couple of questions
about rachel murray.

13:24.900 --> 13:28.859
We were hoping that you
could help us answer them.

13:29.910 --> 13:33.505
So the murder investigation's
finally happening?

13:34.280 --> 13:34.962
Good.

13:34.980 --> 13:38.768
You two were working on
a video project together.

13:38.780 --> 13:41.101
Yeah. Uh, we were.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.947
What was it about?

13:44.020 --> 13:45.749
Growing up weird.

13:46.220 --> 13:47.585
Life.

13:49.160 --> 13:49.683
Us.

13:49.690 --> 13:53.456
And were you with her on
the night of september 30th?

13:53.460 --> 13:54.279
What night was that?

13:54.300 --> 13:56.052
The night that someone
uploaded a video

13:56.060 --> 13:58.392
Of you and rachel
kissing in a car.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.197
Ah. (sighs)

14:00.200 --> 14:01.997
That night. Um...

14:02.000 --> 14:04.798
Then yes.
Uh, i went to see rach...

14:04.810 --> 14:09.201
Tried to calm her down.
We went for a drive.

14:09.210 --> 14:11.405
Did you see anyone else?

14:12.110 --> 14:13.077
Not that i recall.

14:13.080 --> 14:17.369
So, the only person who could
verify your whereabouts

14:17.390 --> 14:20.985
On the night of nina's
murder was rachel.

14:23.730 --> 14:24.958
I guess.

14:24.960 --> 14:26.848
And now rachel's dead.

14:30.430 --> 14:32.125
What are you doing, raine?

14:32.330 --> 14:33.365
Audrey's dad just called me.

14:33.370 --> 14:36.999
You can't question a minor
without a guardian present.
You know that.

14:37.010 --> 14:40.036
And you know that you
have no authority here.

14:40.040 --> 14:40.938
You're off this case.

14:40.940 --> 14:43.329
Okay, well, i'll just
hang with audrey until
her dad gets here.

14:43.350 --> 14:44.977
How's that?

14:48.350 --> 14:50.238
Brooke, uh, hold up a sec.

14:50.250 --> 14:52.081
Look, i need to talk to you
about something, okay?

14:52.090 --> 14:54.888
Like how you're
blackmailing my dad?

14:55.920 --> 14:56.852
Jake.
Yeah.

14:56.860 --> 15:01.126
Jake. He told me all about
what you've been domg.

15:01.130 --> 15:02.097
Oh, what i've been doing?

15:02.100 --> 15:05.297
Look, jake is the one who
dragged me into this
in the first place,

15:05.300 --> 15:06.324
Like i was going to tell you.

15:06.330 --> 15:08.935
Yeah, 'cause jake's
the one who needs money.

15:08.940 --> 15:10.168
Brooke, listen to me.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.569
No, you listen to me.

15:11.570 --> 15:14.130
You better make
this right, will.

15:14.140 --> 15:17.132
You messed with
the wrong family.

15:28.060 --> 15:29.413
(sighs) audrey.

15:29.420 --> 15:31.854
Dad. (sighs)

15:35.030 --> 15:36.258
Are you okay?

15:36.260 --> 15:37.955
Been better.

15:37.970 --> 15:41.360
Sheriff, what's this about?
Is my daughter under arrest?

15:41.370 --> 15:42.189
No, howard, we just...

15:42.200 --> 15:44.395
I just need to clarify
something about what audrey

15:44.410 --> 15:47.766
And her friends found
at that abandoned hospital.

15:49.510 --> 15:51.239
We have nothing to hide.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.377
Thank you. Audrey.

15:58.090 --> 16:00.342
In the hospital,
you and your friends

16:00.360 --> 16:03.579
Found a decomposing
head with a mask on it.

16:04.060 --> 16:05.322
Did you pick it up?

16:05.330 --> 16:07.582
God, no.
You're sure?

16:07.600 --> 16:12.492
We were kind of busy running
in terror, so yeah, i'm sure.

16:13.600 --> 16:16.797
So then help me to
understand something.

16:26.050 --> 16:29.918
Why is your dna on
the inside of the mask?

16:39.830 --> 16:41.457
I've never worn that mask,
i swear.

16:41.460 --> 16:42.996
You... You're sure
It's audrey's dna?

16:43.000 --> 16:46.163
We took fingerprints and swabs
of audrey and her friends,

16:46.170 --> 16:48.388
Just in case they
contaminated the scene.

16:48.400 --> 16:51.494
But looks like audrey
had been there before.

16:51.510 --> 16:52.329
No, i wasn't.

16:52.340 --> 16:55.798
But you and rachel
were making a movie
the night of nina's murder.

16:55.810 --> 16:58.404
And nina's killer posted
a gif online of it,

16:58.410 --> 16:59.570
_So_someone was
filming the murder.

16:59.580 --> 17:03.846
Why not the two girls that
nina had just humiliated
only two hours before?

17:03.850 --> 17:05.715
No.
I'm not comfortable
with this.

17:05.720 --> 17:07.813
What happened to
rachel, audrey?

17:07.820 --> 17:09.253
Did she have second thoughts?

17:09.260 --> 17:11.080
Did she want to confess
what you had done?

17:11.090 --> 17:14.127
Did you have to stop her?
Hudson: Raine!

17:14.130 --> 17:15.791
That's enough.

17:16.030 --> 17:19.864
Yeah, you're right.
You can go now, sheriff.

17:20.940 --> 17:22.362
Thank you.

17:23.340 --> 17:26.901
We're not answering any more
questions without an attorney.

17:26.910 --> 17:27.569
That's fine.

17:27.580 --> 17:33.348
But i would like to see the
footage from audrey's camera
on the night of nina's murder.

17:33.580 --> 17:35.207
I don't have it.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.670
Can i talk to you outside?

17:38.920 --> 17:40.444
Of course.

17:44.990 --> 17:46.457
(sighs)

18:06.450 --> 18:08.645
Noah: (in voicemail)
greetings, programs!
I’m on the game grid

18:08.650 --> 18:11.278
Leave a device id and
i ’ll get back with you...

18:11.290 --> 18:12.609
(grunts)

18:19.530 --> 18:21.987
Noah? What happened?

18:22.560 --> 18:24.221
Henry the ﬁfth
or
napoleon dynamite.

18:24.230 --> 18:28.690
I gotta admit, mr. Branson
so gets my deep-seated
hero conflict.

18:28.700 --> 18:29.769
Cool. I was ready to call 911.

18:29.770 --> 18:33.262
Maybe audrey was right about
branson being innocent.

18:33.270 --> 18:34.339
Maybe he's not a psychopath.

18:34.340 --> 18:39.539
If tyler loaded
the malware for nina
while he was the student aide,

18:39.550 --> 18:41.302
Mr. B could just be
this innocent pawn.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.971
But what about his fake name?
Oh, yeah, well...

18:43.990 --> 18:44.979
I actually got that covered.

18:44.990 --> 18:47.982
I asked mr. B to input his
number into my phone,

18:47.990 --> 18:49.810
In case i wanted to rap
about monologues.

18:49.820 --> 18:53.278
I programmed this app
to record his fingerprints.

18:55.760 --> 18:56.692
If we can trace the past...

18:56.700 --> 19:00.522
We can find out if our
beloved mr. White
is actually heisenberg.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.098
(phone ringing)

19:04.270 --> 19:05.567
Don't answer.

19:05.570 --> 19:08.403
That has proven
not to be an option.

19:11.780 --> 19:12.678
Hello?

19:12.680 --> 19:13.544
Em, it's audrey.

19:13.550 --> 19:16.269
Audrey, are you okay?
Listen...

19:16.280 --> 19:17.975
I need a favor so huge.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.218
Of course. What?

19:19.220 --> 19:20.187
Go to my house.

19:20.190 --> 19:23.512
Get the sd card from
september 30th.. .

19:23.530 --> 19:25.111
And destroy it. And...

19:25.130 --> 19:25.721
(sighs)

19:25.730 --> 19:28.688
Emma, please don't watch it.

19:31.130 --> 19:32.620
Who did you call, audrey?

19:32.630 --> 19:33.562
Pastor jensen: Don't answer.

19:33.570 --> 19:35.322
If you think you have
enough evidence
to charge my daughter...

19:35.340 --> 19:39.504
No, actually, judge seaver
thinks i have enough
to search your home.

19:39.510 --> 19:40.602
She just approved a warrant.

19:40.610 --> 19:42.498
So audrey will stay
here for a while.

19:42.510 --> 19:45.308
I'll let you know
what we find.

19:52.290 --> 19:53.780
What do you think
is on that card?

19:53.790 --> 19:54.643
I don't know. I don't care.

19:54.660 --> 19:56.855
But we should just go get it.
Noah, what if it's...

19:56.860 --> 19:57.610
Emma, hey...

19:57.630 --> 19:59.928
Audrey did not kill nina.

20:00.430 --> 20:03.399
Right. Right, okay, let's go.

20:08.340 --> 20:09.489
(sighs) well,
we've got some time.

20:09.500 --> 20:14.301
Daddy's off teaching
a "stranger danger" seminar
to a bunch of grade-schoolers.

20:14.310 --> 20:19.145
If your dad is capable
of whatever it was
we saw on that video,

20:19.150 --> 20:19.946
What if he's done more?

20:19.950 --> 20:21.679
(scoffs) are you
accusing my dad

20:21.680 --> 20:25.377
Of multiple murders
to raise his pr profile?

20:25.390 --> 20:27.711
Well, it's like
stephen king says,

20:27.720 --> 20:29.153
"murder is like potato chips.

20:29.160 --> 20:31.219
"you can't just
stop with one."

20:31.230 --> 20:35.155
I'm hoping my dad never
opened that bag of chips.

20:38.170 --> 20:39.922
No, i can't do it.

20:39.930 --> 20:44.560
If she's in there,
i lose both of my parents.

20:45.610 --> 20:47.908
Let's rip this band-aid off.

20:55.550 --> 20:56.209
Oh, my god.

20:56.220 --> 20:58.984
I think this is a piece of
the guest room bed sheets.

20:58.990 --> 21:00.116
So it's a sheet.

21:00.120 --> 21:03.908
Maybe your dad wrapped
a deer in it or something.

21:04.730 --> 21:05.355
Sorry.

21:05.360 --> 21:07.681
There's gotta be
an explanation.

21:07.700 --> 21:10.294
I mean, right? (sighs)

21:10.300 --> 21:12.393
He couldn't have done it.

21:13.130 --> 21:15.018
There totally is.

21:15.870 --> 21:18.964
Don't worry. We'll find it.

21:27.480 --> 21:30.278
Damn. They used to
hide their key there.

21:30.290 --> 21:32.747
Yeah, we used to leave
our back door unlocked.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.945
And then a serial
killer happened.

21:35.390 --> 21:37.153
All right. On to plan b.

21:37.160 --> 21:39.754
Love me some plan b.
What is it?

21:41.460 --> 21:43.257
I hope there's no alarm.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.762
Okay.
Subtle.

22:04.250 --> 22:05.569
Where does she
keep her sd cards?

22:05.590 --> 22:06.784
What do i look like,
her personal assistant?

22:06.790 --> 22:10.715
Well, you look like
someone who might know
where would keep her sd cards.

22:11.060 --> 22:12.721
That's clothes.

22:13.360 --> 22:15.282
Noah: Man, she's
so disorganized.

22:15.300 --> 22:16.790
Weird.

22:20.840 --> 22:24.139
Hey, wait, hold on.
Uh, that's elvish.

22:24.670 --> 22:26.103
Great.

22:27.940 --> 22:29.874
Whoa, here they are.

22:33.580 --> 22:35.946
Got it.
(car door slams shut)

22:36.250 --> 22:40.482
0h, frak. We got the
polio/a
We gotta get out of here.

22:40.490 --> 22:43.311
Now, emma.
Who says she
files them neatly?

22:43.320 --> 22:46.448
All right,
her room's upstairs,
check the rest of the house.

22:46.460 --> 22:48.223
(whispering) back.

22:55.670 --> 22:57.490
(curtain rustling)

23:20.900 --> 23:22.754
I can't. You do it.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.128
(sighs)

23:26.130 --> 23:30.237
No can do. I feel like frodo
with the ring at mount doom.

23:30.240 --> 23:32.538
I mean,
what do you think's on there?

23:32.540 --> 23:33.234
I don't know. I...

23:33.240 --> 23:35.800
I don't want to break
audrey's trust,
but whatever is on there

23:35.810 --> 23:38.028
Must make her
look really guilty.

23:38.050 --> 23:38.630
Of what?

23:38.650 --> 23:40.971
Murdering four people,
including her girlfriend?

23:40.980 --> 23:42.174
(sighs)
do you have any idea

23:42.180 --> 23:44.319
How japanese gameshow
crazy that sounds?

23:44.320 --> 23:46.584
There's one thing
i can't shake.

23:46.590 --> 23:47.545
What?

23:47.560 --> 23:49.255
That guy who's
been calling me?

23:49.260 --> 23:51.080
He should be rubbing this
in my face right now.

23:51.090 --> 23:54.628
But since audrey was taken in,
i haven't heard one thing.

23:54.630 --> 23:56.689
(phone ringing)

24:00.330 --> 24:01.661
Mom?

24:02.340 --> 24:03.637
What?

24:04.310 --> 24:06.130
No. Of course not.

24:06.870 --> 24:08.167
Okay.

24:08.640 --> 24:09.937
Okay.

24:12.310 --> 24:13.743
(breathing deeply)

24:13.750 --> 24:17.618
Detective brock wants to see
me at the sheriff's station.

24:17.820 --> 24:20.243
Detective brock: I know
audrey called you, emma.

24:20.250 --> 24:21.410
You want to tell me
what she said?

24:21.420 --> 24:26.722
She wanted me to call her mom
before her dad overreacted
and freaked her out.

24:26.960 --> 24:28.723
Her mom is in boston.

24:28.730 --> 24:30.357
Cancer treatments.

24:30.730 --> 24:32.664
I'm sorry that she's ill.

24:32.870 --> 24:36.465
There was a break-in at
audrey's house today.

24:36.700 --> 24:38.588
You know anything about that?

24:39.310 --> 24:40.436
No.

24:40.440 --> 24:41.361
Look, i get it.

24:41.380 --> 24:43.336
You want to protect
yourfnend.

24:43.340 --> 24:44.671
But what if you're wrong?

24:44.680 --> 24:46.568
I know audrey.

24:46.580 --> 24:47.945
You never know.

24:47.950 --> 24:51.408
You know, every killer
is someone's friend.

24:51.750 --> 24:52.546
Someone's family.

24:52.550 --> 24:56.452
If emma says she doesn't know,
she doesn't.

24:56.660 --> 24:58.150
Can we go now?

24:59.090 --> 25:00.523
Okay.

25:00.730 --> 25:02.129
But if i'm right...

25:02.130 --> 25:06.123
If audrey goes free
and someone else dies,

25:06.430 --> 25:09.160
You are just
as guilty as she is.

25:09.170 --> 25:10.694
(scoffs)

25:11.240 --> 25:13.060
You're free to go.

25:18.780 --> 25:20.179
Thanks.

25:20.450 --> 25:22.145
Are you sure?

25:22.880 --> 25:24.279
I know that this looks bad.

25:24.290 --> 25:25.279
But i can't help feeling

25:25.290 --> 25:27.679
That someone wants it
to look that way.

25:29.660 --> 25:32.584
You go on.
I have to check something.

25:32.590 --> 25:34.148
I'll see you at home.

25:34.160 --> 25:35.582
Okay.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.627
(water gushing)

25:43.600 --> 25:45.363
Take it sleazy, fitzgerald.

25:45.370 --> 25:46.962
No other way.

25:59.820 --> 26:01.310
(sighs)

26:10.930 --> 26:11.794
Damn it!

26:11.800 --> 26:14.860
(breathing heavily
and grunting)

26:28.020 --> 26:32.639
How many times has
coac_h told us not to lift
Without a spotter?

26:32.650 --> 26:35.016
Here, let me
help you with that.

26:36.660 --> 26:37.251
Jake".

26:37.260 --> 26:40.650
(grunting)
where's the phone and
the money, william?

26:40.660 --> 26:42.628
How the hell do i know?

26:43.700 --> 26:46.123
If you try and
burn me with that video,

26:46.130 --> 26:48.963
They'll find you in
pieces in a ditch.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.166
Jake".

26:53.170 --> 26:55.309
(grunting) jake!

27:02.320 --> 27:04.208
(panﬁng)

27:13.360 --> 27:14.884
Hey, stretch.

27:14.900 --> 27:17.027
Decide to take me up
on my offer?

27:17.030 --> 27:18.657
(sighs) not yet.

27:18.930 --> 27:21.125
But, i do want to
make things right.

27:21.340 --> 27:22.068
And if you help me,

27:22.070 --> 27:24.937
I'll give you a story
you never saw coming.

27:25.540 --> 27:26.837
Okay, i'm intrigued.

27:26.840 --> 27:28.159
You care to give
me a headline?

27:28.180 --> 27:31.479
I'd rather you hear it
directly from the source.

27:31.710 --> 27:33.246
Come on.

27:39.150 --> 27:41.448
Are you absolutely
sure about this?

27:41.460 --> 27:42.449
I'd rather know than wonder.

27:42.460 --> 27:45.816
I gotta be honest, i still
have some moral ambivalence.

27:45.830 --> 27:46.979
Well, no one's
making you watch it.

27:46.990 --> 27:51.051
Well, i wouldn't want you
to carry that burden
all by yourself.

27:51.070 --> 27:54.790
Look, noah,
i just want the truth.

27:55.040 --> 27:57.235
Okay. Truth.

27:57.610 --> 27:59.532
In glorious hd.

27:59.740 --> 28:00.934
Here we go.

28:00.940 --> 28:01.634
Stop filming me/

28:01.640 --> 28:03.232
Rachel:
No.
You need to see yourself?

28:03.240 --> 28:04.673
You don ’t even know
ifnina did this.

28:04.680 --> 28:05.669
Audrey:
Of course she did it/

28:05.680 --> 28:07.898
She has been torturing me
my entire life.

28:07.920 --> 28:08.670
Not an ymore/

28:08.680 --> 28:10.341
Rachel:
If we do this,
we are even worse than nina.

28:10.350 --> 28:13.148
So what i’m supposed
to just keep taking it?

28:13.150 --> 28:13.912
Screw that/

28:13.920 --> 28:18.516
People l/ke nina dump on
everyone and you know
what happens to them?

28:18.530 --> 28:19.087
lVoth/ng.

28:19.090 --> 28:22.890
They marry billionaires
and wear prada in their
climate-trashing yachts.

28:22.900 --> 28:24.697
Because karma
doesn ’tjust happen!

28:24.700 --> 28:27.225
Somet/mes, you have to
take it into your own hands.

28:27.230 --> 28:28.060
Rachel:
Audrey, please!

28:28.070 --> 28:30.789
Tonight, i'm shiva
the destroyer, and i'm coming
for that sorry bitch!

28:30.810 --> 28:33.631
When i'm done, she'll never
bully anyone ever again.

28:33.640 --> 28:35.403
I said, turn that off!

28:39.580 --> 28:41.673
Audrey, what did you do?

28:45.090 --> 28:46.216
Why'd you make me watch?

28:46.220 --> 28:48.347
I can't un-see that now.
I can't.

28:48.360 --> 28:49.247
It can't be how it looks.

28:49.260 --> 28:51.558
You mean_ how it looks like
premeditated murder?

28:51.560 --> 28:55.189
I mean it. I need, like,
a
men in black
brain wipe.

28:55.200 --> 28:56.349
She was so angry.

28:56.360 --> 28:57.827
Noah, we both know audrey.

28:57.830 --> 28:58.694
Yeah, we do.

28:58.700 --> 29:01.419
I always believed audrey was
capable of murder, but, like,

29:01.440 --> 29:04.898
In an "isn't my best friend
badass, i'll never lose
a bar fight" way.

29:04.910 --> 29:07.504
But, this...
Noah. You're wrong.

29:08.140 --> 29:09.129
Okay?

29:09.140 --> 29:11.233
Just take it and go. Please.

29:11.250 --> 29:14.879
I gotta think,
and i don't want it here.

29:25.290 --> 29:29.329
. . . Never bully anyone ever
aga/n. .7 said, turn that off!

29:29.330 --> 29:31.992
Hi. Whatcha doing?

29:32.200 --> 29:35.294
Just thinking,
about everything.

29:35.900 --> 29:38.391
I know you're worried
about audrey.

29:38.410 --> 29:41.607
We all care about her.
We'll get to the truth.

29:43.940 --> 29:48.309
What if the truth is that my
friend is capable of murder?

29:51.490 --> 29:54.982
Grab your jacket.
We're going out.

30:10.270 --> 30:11.589
Mom, where are we?

30:11.610 --> 30:13.635
This is nana's old house.

30:13.640 --> 30:15.039
Before the murders.

30:15.040 --> 30:18.237
You wanted answers about
what happened that night.

30:18.250 --> 30:19.205
This is where they are.

30:19.210 --> 30:22.748
And why didn't you ever
mention this place before?

30:23.250 --> 30:25.969
After the killings, the press
wouldn't let the story die,

30:25.990 --> 30:29.482
So my family moved away
until things settled down.

30:29.490 --> 30:32.857
So they wouldn't figure out
that you were daisy.

30:34.130 --> 30:35.586
Come on.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.649
That was my room.

30:40.400 --> 30:42.789
My swing set was over there.

30:44.210 --> 30:45.768
This is where it began.

30:45.770 --> 30:47.533
Where what began?

30:48.610 --> 30:50.134
Brandon.

30:51.510 --> 30:52.909
Come on.

30:58.290 --> 31:00.986
Oh, my god. That's his house.

31:02.390 --> 31:05.484
And yes, there was
a shed in the baclqard.

31:05.490 --> 31:07.378
But bran didn't live in it.

31:07.390 --> 31:08.926
Bran?

31:10.760 --> 31:13.695
He was so shy.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.790
Maggie:
And i was curious.

31:17.140 --> 31:22.908
He used to leave me gifts,
carv/ngs, drawmgs of me.

31:23.180 --> 31:24.101
I wrote h/m notes.

31:24.110 --> 31:27.898
I think we were just happy
to have someone listen.

31:28.480 --> 31:30.914
Brandon wasn ’t a monster.

31:31.120 --> 31:32.849
He was my friend

31:33.220 --> 31:34.778
We grew up together.

31:34.790 --> 31:39.409
But in high school,
he knew your dad and i
were having problems.

31:39.630 --> 31:41.154
Bran came to
the dance that night

31:41.160 --> 31:43.924
To convince me that
i deserved better.

31:44.130 --> 31:47.622
A friend of mine overheard
us talking and told your dad.

31:48.140 --> 31:50.267
That's when the fight started.

31:50.540 --> 31:51.290
And the bloodshed.

31:51.310 --> 31:55.269
Mom, there's no way that
you could've known
that he was gonna snap.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.009
I'm not convinced he did.

31:57.010 --> 32:00.070
But, everybody
said that that was...

32:00.080 --> 32:00.808
I know.

32:00.810 --> 32:04.177
I left him a note to
meet me on the dock.

32:04.180 --> 32:07.479
But my dad saw me
and called the police.

32:08.990 --> 32:10.958
I just wanted to talk to him.

32:11.460 --> 32:15.487
Maggie:
When bran showed up,
he was so scared.

32:18.100 --> 32:19.692
(gun firing)

32:21.400 --> 32:23.595
And then, they shot h/m.

32:23.600 --> 32:26.763
I've always felt that if
i had stood up for him,

32:26.770 --> 32:30.171
If i had told the police that
the person that i knew

32:30.180 --> 32:32.944
Couldn't have
done those things...

32:33.650 --> 32:35.470
He'd still be alive.

32:37.180 --> 32:39.683
Why are you finally
telling me this?

32:39.690 --> 32:43.410
Because i don't want you to
make the same mistake.

32:43.620 --> 32:46.384
People saw brandon
as a monster.

32:46.690 --> 32:48.783
And i didn't defend him.

32:52.730 --> 32:56.860
If you believe in your heart
audrey couldn't do this,

32:57.140 --> 32:58.892
You listen to that.

32:58.910 --> 33:01.128
Or you'll always regret it.

33:15.190 --> 33:16.043
Raine?

33:16.060 --> 33:18.620
(sighs) hud,
why are you still here?

33:18.630 --> 33:20.825
Someone wanted to see you.

33:22.930 --> 33:24.329
Detective. ..

33:24.830 --> 33:26.593
I'm ready to talk.

33:28.970 --> 33:30.835
Audrey hated
nina patterson.

33:30.840 --> 33:33.365
She wanted to
teach her a lesson.

33:33.570 --> 33:34.798
She wanted to hurt her.

33:34.810 --> 33:37.779
You do realize that this
is gomg on the record?

33:37.780 --> 33:38.439
Yeah. I hope so.

33:38.450 --> 33:41.977
Because she didn't do it.
I stopped her.

33:41.980 --> 33:43.072
You stopped her?

33:43.080 --> 33:45.548
She didn't mention
seeing you that night.

33:45.550 --> 33:47.643
Well, she was covering for me.

33:47.650 --> 33:49.641
And why would she do that?

33:49.660 --> 33:50.979
Nina and i both
made that video.

33:50.990 --> 33:53.788
I didn't do the release, but
the night that it went viral,

33:53.790 --> 33:55.758
I went to audrey to confess.

33:55.760 --> 33:57.955
She had every
reason to hate me,

33:57.970 --> 34:00.996
But she promised
not to tell anyone.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.093
She was lying to protect me.

34:03.100 --> 34:08.629
Emma told me about her
part in the Video release
after rachel's death.

34:08.840 --> 34:10.671
She felt responsible.

34:12.510 --> 34:15.149
You willing to
sign an affidavit?

34:15.620 --> 34:16.939
Yes.

34:21.090 --> 34:22.682
All right.

34:22.890 --> 34:24.881
I will make a call.

34:32.700 --> 34:33.689
So the da agrees with you.

34:33.700 --> 34:35.190
With all the activity
at the hospital,

34:35.200 --> 34:38.237
The dna evidence _could've
been compromised.

34:38.240 --> 34:40.800
You're enjoying this
a little too much.

34:40.810 --> 34:43.028
Nah. Just, just enough.

34:50.520 --> 34:51.919
Emma: Hey.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.580
Can't believe you did that.

35:00.590 --> 35:02.387
Are we even yet?

35:03.460 --> 35:05.052
Getting close.

35:07.970 --> 35:09.619
Did you watch it?

35:11.110 --> 35:12.463
Yeah.

35:14.070 --> 35:16.129
Why did you keep it?

35:16.140 --> 35:20.804
What you don't see is
after i knocked the camera
out of her hands,

35:20.810 --> 35:24.439
Rachel took my keys and
threw them out of the window.

35:26.290 --> 35:27.018
I was so angry.

35:27.020 --> 35:30.217
I was searching the brush
like a lunatic. But...

35:30.560 --> 35:34.519
But she stopped me from doing
something terrible that night.

35:39.270 --> 35:41.898
I kept it to remind myself

35:42.100 --> 35:45.763
Never to lose control
like that again. And...

35:45.970 --> 35:49.872
And it's one of the last
videos i have of her.

35:52.280 --> 35:54.840
I guess i couldn't let it go.

35:57.180 --> 35:58.943
You don't have to.

36:10.030 --> 36:11.452
Thank you.

36:38.890 --> 36:40.482
(sighs)

36:53.640 --> 36:55.961
(voice echoing) hello!

36:58.410 --> 37:00.344
Hello!

37:10.520 --> 37:12.579
I know who you are.

37:14.960 --> 37:16.848
Hello, mr. Maddox.

37:17.060 --> 37:18.493
Hello, will.

37:21.470 --> 37:23.267
It's not my money.

37:24.340 --> 37:26.399
Then why are we here?

37:30.180 --> 37:33.502
This is all the money
you've paid so far,

37:33.510 --> 37:36.775
And the last existing
copy of the video.

37:38.390 --> 37:40.779
How do i know that for sure?

37:42.860 --> 37:44.714
I give you my word.

37:45.060 --> 37:47.779
I don't have much
else right now,

37:48.160 --> 37:49.957
But i have that.

37:50.460 --> 37:52.291
Did you watch it?

37:52.830 --> 37:55.128
No.
Give it to me.

38:03.710 --> 38:07.874
I've done a lot of things
i'm sorry for
in the past year.

38:08.080 --> 38:11.811
I really don't wanna
die for doing the right thing.

38:17.760 --> 38:20.388
Not a word of this to anyone.

38:25.970 --> 38:30.430
Remember, there's
a killer on the loose.

38:39.610 --> 38:41.100
(door closes)

38:41.450 --> 38:43.475
Did you hear all that?

38:46.590 --> 38:48.046
Piper: It's not
the story i came for,

38:48.060 --> 38:51.416
But it's a hell of
a bonus chapter.

38:53.560 --> 38:58.850
You realize he just
threatened to make you
victim number five, right?

39:04.040 --> 39:05.632
Piper: Hello?

39:07.440 --> 39:09.203
Will: Who's there?

39:13.910 --> 39:15.343
We should go.

39:15.920 --> 39:17.444
Definitely.

39:17.450 --> 39:19.042
(will sighs)

39:25.190 --> 39:27.021
There.
Okay.

39:29.530 --> 39:31.088
It's locked.

39:31.570 --> 39:33.390
We'll find another way out.

39:35.300 --> 39:37.837
(will breathing heavily)

39:56.820 --> 39:59.118
Will: Piper! Hey! (grunts)

39:59.390 --> 40:00.982
(piper grunts)

40:01.630 --> 40:03.552
(grunting)

40:06.200 --> 40:07.758
(panﬁng)

40:11.540 --> 40:13.405
(piper groaning)

40:23.750 --> 40:25.069
(grunts)

40:27.090 --> 40:28.318
Piper! Help!

40:28.320 --> 40:31.357
No... No, no...

40:31.360 --> 40:32.679
No, no!

40:34.530 --> 40:37.090
(theme music playing)
