00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:04.038 --> 00:04.770
<i> (theme song playing)</i>

00:08.943 --> 00:12.378
<i> ¶ I got the wind in my hair</i>
<i> and a fire within ¶</i>

00:12.380 --> 00:14.446
<i> ¶ 'Cause there's</i>
<i> something beginning ¶</i>

00:14.448 --> 00:20.185
<i> ¶ I got a mystery to solve</i>
<i> and excitement to spare ¶</i>

00:20.187 --> 00:23.355
<i> ¶ That beautiful breeze</i>
<i> blowing through ¶</i>

00:23.357 --> 00:28.193
<i> ¶ I'm ready to follow it</i>
<i> who knows where ¶</i>

00:28.195 --> 00:30.796
<i> ¶ I'll get there, I swear ¶</i>

00:30.798 --> 00:36.969
<i> ¶ With the wind in my hair ¶</i>

00:42.743 --> 00:44.743
<i> Previously, on</i> Tangled...

00:44.745 --> 00:48.013
Captain:
<i> Rapunzel, I think your parents</i>
<i> are in grave danger.</i>

00:48.015 --> 00:49.681
Nigel:
<i> You can't just</i>
<i> leave your kingdom</i>

00:49.683 --> 00:51.083
<i> in its darkest hour!</i>

00:51.085 --> 00:54.353
Varian:
<i> My dad needs help!</i>
<i> Rapunzel! You promised!</i>

00:54.355 --> 00:56.155
Nigel:
<i> We need you</i>
<i> to make a decision!</i>

01:07.435 --> 01:11.437
(crumbling sounds)

01:15.409 --> 01:17.743
Zhan Tiri!

01:24.351 --> 01:27.786
-Oh. Oh! Excuse me!
-Good morning, princess.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.188
-Pardon us, princess.
-Sorry.

01:29.190 --> 01:30.689
Hello, princess.

01:30.691 --> 01:31.924
What's this?

01:33.727 --> 01:37.096
Dad, what is going on?
What's with all this art?

01:37.098 --> 01:38.564
Ah, there are you, Rapunzel.

01:38.566 --> 01:40.866
I've got a little
surprise for you.

01:40.868 --> 01:42.301
(squeaks)

01:43.771 --> 01:46.638
The Gallery
of the Seven Kingdoms!

01:46.640 --> 01:48.307
(gasps)
Really?

01:48.309 --> 01:50.142
You're actually gonna build it?

01:50.144 --> 01:51.710
Yes, we already have.

01:51.712 --> 01:54.113
And in the spirit
of artistic expression,

01:54.115 --> 01:55.647
I've asked
the citizens of Corona

01:55.649 --> 01:57.549
to contribute
their work as well.

01:57.551 --> 01:59.551
This is amazing!

01:59.553 --> 02:01.286
There is one piece
I'd like to add

02:01.288 --> 02:03.055
before opening the gallery,

02:03.057 --> 02:05.924
a mural by Corona's
most celebrated artist...

02:05.926 --> 02:07.459
Princess Rapunzel.

02:09.296 --> 02:12.064
Dad, I'm speechless.

02:12.066 --> 02:14.566
Well, let's just say
after the events
of the great storm

02:14.568 --> 02:16.335
and the judgment
you demonstrated,

02:16.337 --> 02:17.603
I've been looking for ways

02:17.605 --> 02:20.172
to implement more
of your good ideas.

02:21.942 --> 02:23.342
Now, get painting!

02:43.597 --> 02:46.331
Finally I get to express
my artistic side.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.734
Time to shine, Feldspar!

02:51.472 --> 02:53.405
(ghostly voice)
Perfect!

02:55.009 --> 02:58.810
Oh, well, thank you so much.
I-- eh--

02:58.812 --> 03:02.381
This is a dream project, Pascal!

03:02.383 --> 03:04.650
I have had so many ideas

03:04.652 --> 03:06.552
for what a mural this size
could look like.

03:06.554 --> 03:08.153
It's hard to pick just one.

03:08.155 --> 03:09.922
(squeaking)

03:11.458 --> 03:13.559
You're right.

03:13.561 --> 03:15.394
Just make a decision
and go with it.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.799
Just make a decision.

03:20.801 --> 03:24.136
Nigel:
<i> Your highness, we need you</i>
<i> to make a decision now!</i>

03:24.138 --> 03:26.505
Captain:
<i> The entire kingdom rests</i>
<i> on the choice you make!</i>

03:26.507 --> 03:27.839
Nigel:
<i> Lives are at stake here!</i>

03:27.841 --> 03:29.074
Captain:
<i> It's your call.</i>

03:33.380 --> 03:35.380
Okay, it's like I wanna paint,

03:35.382 --> 03:38.417
but I just... can't.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.152
What is going on?

03:40.154 --> 03:41.386
Sounds like painter's block.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.488
Painter's block?

03:43.490 --> 03:45.357
Wait. You mean
like writer's block?

03:45.359 --> 03:46.758
Yeah.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.727
You're just having a hard time
being creative is all.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.596
What the princess needs

03:50.598 --> 03:53.198
is a way to punch through
the painter's block.

03:53.200 --> 03:56.201
Or maybe what
she needs is a little...

03:56.203 --> 03:57.736
inspiration!

03:57.738 --> 04:00.072
That's it!
Come on, Pascal.

04:00.074 --> 04:02.874
Let's go find
some real inspiration.

04:02.876 --> 04:05.377
She walked right past
the smolder.

04:05.379 --> 04:06.445
She's worse than we thought.

04:11.518 --> 04:12.951
Rapunzel:
Wow!

04:12.953 --> 04:16.455
Who knew Corona had
so many talented artists?

04:16.457 --> 04:20.025
Look at these paintings!
They are all so beautiful.

04:20.027 --> 04:22.794
(giggling)

04:27.268 --> 04:29.201
In their... own way.

04:29.203 --> 04:31.637
-(wind blows)
-(eerie music plays)

04:31.639 --> 04:35.540
Life is full
of tough choices,

04:35.542 --> 04:37.576
isn't it, dear?

04:37.578 --> 04:39.978
Oh, I'm so sorry.

04:39.980 --> 04:43.649
I didn't realize
you were talking
to your little friend.

04:43.651 --> 04:44.916
It's okay.

04:44.918 --> 04:47.552
I just hear
an artist in trouble

04:47.554 --> 04:49.588
and I want to help.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.490
It's in my nature.

04:52.826 --> 04:53.992
Are you an artist?

04:53.994 --> 04:56.228
I'm an art teacher, dear.

04:56.230 --> 04:58.130
I'm Mrs. Sugarby,

04:58.132 --> 05:01.633
a-- and I think I might
be able to help you.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.406
I got your message, sir.
Is anything the matter?

05:07.408 --> 05:08.540
I have a job for you.

05:10.144 --> 05:12.477
-(gasps) A mission?
-Of sorts.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.813
Captain:
In 10 years,
Feldspar Willipeg,

05:14.815 --> 05:17.249
the cobbler,
has never missed
a day of work.

05:17.251 --> 05:19.151
Until today.

05:19.153 --> 05:21.420
He had appointments,
but he was a no-show.

05:21.422 --> 05:24.156
I sent some men to his home,
but he wasn't there.

05:24.158 --> 05:25.490
I could be overreacting,

05:25.492 --> 05:27.426
but I'd like you
to look into it.

05:28.595 --> 05:32.030
-Huh?
-I'm sure Feldspar is fine.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.168
I mean, what kinda trouble
could he get into?

05:43.711 --> 05:45.644
That's it, dear.

05:45.646 --> 05:47.612
Just shut off your mind

05:47.614 --> 05:51.683
and leave the rest
to Zhan Tiri.

05:54.655 --> 05:56.355
One down...

05:56.357 --> 05:58.590
four to go.

06:03.731 --> 06:06.298
-(squeaking)
-Thank you, Pascal.

06:06.300 --> 06:08.066
Good morning, class.

06:08.068 --> 06:10.535
I have some
very exciting news.

06:10.537 --> 06:13.638
We have two
new students joining us

06:13.640 --> 06:16.241
on our artistic odyssey,

06:16.243 --> 06:20.178
Princess Rapunzel
and Lance Strongbow.

06:20.180 --> 06:22.314
Hi, everybody!

06:22.316 --> 06:25.484
I can't wait
to start learning
and get painting.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.819
And I'm here
to help the princess...

06:27.821 --> 06:29.988
(mutters)
and make some extra cash
on the side.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.523
Friedborg? Wow,

06:31.525 --> 06:33.759
you're really getting into
this whole painting thing, huh?

06:37.164 --> 06:39.731
Okay, Friedborg, yeah.
Good talk.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.667
Now on to today's subject.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.939
Okay. Let's do this.

06:51.879 --> 06:54.045
Nigel:
<i> Your highness, we need you</i>
<i> to make a decision now!</i>

06:54.047 --> 06:56.248
Captain:
<i> The welfare of the entire</i>
<i> kingdom rests on the choice--</i>

06:56.250 --> 06:57.883
Nigel:
<i> Lives are at stake here.</i>

06:57.885 --> 06:59.584
-Captain:<i> It's your call!</i>
-Nigel:<i> It has to be now!</i>

07:04.558 --> 07:05.957
What's the matter?

07:05.959 --> 07:07.559
Drawing a blank?

07:07.561 --> 07:10.762
Mrs. Sugarby,
I don't know what it is.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.964
(squeaks)

07:12.966 --> 07:14.766
I have this
painter's block.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.268
It's like I want to paint,

07:16.270 --> 07:17.803
but I when I try to...

07:18.806 --> 07:21.373
I just can't make a decision.

07:21.375 --> 07:24.810
Ah, yes. I've seen
this many times before.

07:24.812 --> 07:27.779
Everyone wants
to put their own spin

07:27.781 --> 07:29.414
on their subjects,

07:29.416 --> 07:32.584
but that can lead
to overthinking, dear.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.586
There is nothing
to think about.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.655
No decisions to be made.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.924
Just paint the tree

07:38.926 --> 07:41.726
exactly as you see it.

07:41.728 --> 07:44.095
Okay. I'll try.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.630
(squeaks)

07:58.278 --> 08:00.779
It doesn't seem
very exciting, does it?

08:00.781 --> 08:03.782
Rapunzel,
this is perfect.

08:03.784 --> 08:05.417
-It is?
-In fact,

08:05.419 --> 08:07.586
it's one of the strongest
in the class.

08:07.588 --> 08:09.321
-No offense, Lance.
-None taken.

08:13.093 --> 08:16.628
Pardon me.
<i>Artiste</i> coming through.

08:16.630 --> 08:19.598
I'm very proud of the work
you did today, Rapunzel,

08:19.600 --> 08:21.666
and you should be too.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.301
Thanks, Mrs. Sugarby.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.804
Although I wouldn't say
it's my best work.

08:25.806 --> 08:28.773
Rapunzel,
give yourself some credit.

08:28.775 --> 08:32.677
All things have
their own beauty.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.546
(bell pealing)

08:35.883 --> 08:37.682
(hooting)

08:37.684 --> 08:39.451
(sighs) I don't know, Owl.

08:39.453 --> 08:40.719
I've questioned
half the town

08:40.721 --> 08:43.154
and hit up all
of Feldspar's usual haunts,

08:43.156 --> 08:44.456
but nothing.

08:44.458 --> 08:46.224
How does someone
just disappear into thin air?

08:47.361 --> 08:48.894
Hey, Crumb-Wedge!

08:48.896 --> 08:50.529
I need you in linens.

08:50.531 --> 08:51.796
Today's my day off.

08:51.798 --> 08:53.465
Friedborg is supposed
to cover linens today.

08:53.467 --> 08:55.667
Well, she didn't show up.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.736
That's not like Friedborg.
Is she okay?

08:57.738 --> 09:00.372
What am I?
Her biographer?

09:05.245 --> 09:07.012
-(knocks)
-Cassandra: Friedborg?

09:07.014 --> 09:08.880
Are you here?

09:08.882 --> 09:10.715
Hello?

09:10.717 --> 09:12.384
Friedborg?

09:18.892 --> 09:20.859
Eugene:
Well, I guess
the good thing is

09:20.861 --> 09:21.993
she got you
painting again.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.094
I mean, it looks like...

09:24.331 --> 09:26.197
(clears throat)
what it's supposed
to look like.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.599
You don't like it?

09:27.601 --> 09:29.000
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I didn't say that.

09:29.002 --> 09:31.937
I'm just saying
it's missing a little...

09:31.939 --> 09:33.905
"Rapunzelocity."

09:33.907 --> 09:35.106
Well, maybe I don't need

09:35.108 --> 09:37.676
to put my own spin
on everything, Eugene.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.511
(squeaks)

09:40.881 --> 09:42.847
It's just like
Mrs. Sugarby says,

09:42.849 --> 09:45.784
"All things have
their own beauty."

09:45.786 --> 09:48.019
(door opens, closes)

09:49.122 --> 09:51.356
Lance:
Hey! Hi! (laughs)

09:51.358 --> 09:54.125
You look like a man
who appreciates fine art.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.731
Like this!

09:59.732 --> 10:01.365
Sugarby:
The life of an artist
isn't an easy one,

10:01.368 --> 10:03.568
is it, Mr. Strongbow?

10:03.570 --> 10:05.270
Oh, hi, Mrs. Sugarset.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.205
I'm glad I found you.

10:07.207 --> 10:09.708
I've been thinking
about your work.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.710
What if I could
teach you to make art

10:11.712 --> 10:15.146
that you could sell
for untold riches?

10:15.148 --> 10:17.716
Untold riches?

10:17.718 --> 10:19.718
Those are the best kind.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.126
Sugarby (distantly):
Come. I'll show you.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.795
It will be my pleasure.

10:38.505 --> 10:39.704
(tapping)

10:44.277 --> 10:45.777
Huh?

10:45.779 --> 10:47.979
This is strange.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.280
Where is everyone?

10:49.282 --> 10:51.182
Oh! Uh, your classmates

10:51.184 --> 10:53.752
have progressed
so splendidly

10:53.754 --> 10:54.786
that I've given them all

10:54.788 --> 10:57.322
a special project
to work on together.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.957
But don't worry.

10:58.959 --> 11:02.093
You'll be joining
them very soon.

11:03.630 --> 11:06.431
Hmm. Gah, needs
a little something.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.099
How about...

11:09.136 --> 11:10.368
some color?

11:10.370 --> 11:12.604
What are you doing?

11:12.606 --> 11:14.105
N-Nothing.
I-I just thought

11:14.107 --> 11:15.974
it could use
a personal touch.

11:15.976 --> 11:18.943
Hmm. Good thought.

11:18.945 --> 11:21.346
Perhaps a brighter color?

11:21.348 --> 11:23.848
But what if it's
not the right color?

11:23.850 --> 11:27.018
Or you put it
in the wrong spot?

11:27.020 --> 11:28.019
You're right.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.387
I just--

11:29.389 --> 11:31.456
I can't decide what to do.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.958
(rhythmic tapping)

11:33.960 --> 11:36.895
Sugarby:
Well, dear, making
difficult choices

11:36.897 --> 11:39.397
is a part of life.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.966
(tapping continues)

11:41.968 --> 11:45.236
"Making difficult choices
is a part of life."

11:48.875 --> 11:51.042
There. Isn't that better?

11:51.044 --> 11:53.078
(tapping resumes)

11:54.047 --> 11:55.280
Much better.

11:59.419 --> 12:02.654
Where do you get off
calling us "ruffians"?

12:02.656 --> 12:05.056
-(indistinct shouting)
-(crashes)

12:05.058 --> 12:05.990
Point taken.

12:05.992 --> 12:07.892
I'm just looking
for some missing people,

12:07.894 --> 12:09.994
and usually when
something bad goes down,

12:09.996 --> 12:11.996
bad people know about it.

12:11.998 --> 12:14.032
First of all,
we're not bad people.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.034
-(indistinct shouting)
-(crashes)

12:16.036 --> 12:17.335
We're working on it.

12:17.337 --> 12:20.038
And second,
we got a missing
person of our own.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.339
Ulf is missing.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.076
I thought I'd be glad
to get rid of that mime.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.277
But I kinda miss

12:26.279 --> 12:29.247
the "I'm stuck
in a box" routine.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.783
You don't know
how to do any mime, do you?

12:31.785 --> 12:32.851
No.

12:35.055 --> 12:36.387
Who painted that?

12:36.389 --> 12:37.455
Attila:
Ulf did.

12:37.457 --> 12:40.058
I thought it was
kinda weird, too.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.861
It's a real departure
from his normal work.

12:51.972 --> 12:54.405
Where is Rapunzel?
She's never late.

12:54.407 --> 12:57.075
In fact, she's usually
30 minutes early for our dates.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.276
Hey, Frog?

12:58.278 --> 12:59.878
Is it me
or has the princess

12:59.880 --> 13:02.046
been acting
a little off lately?

13:02.048 --> 13:03.281
-Hi.
-(screams)

13:03.283 --> 13:04.816
(chuckles)
There you are.

13:04.818 --> 13:07.218
I've been waiting--
holy shoes!

13:07.220 --> 13:09.053
Oh. Yeah.

13:09.055 --> 13:12.223
I guess I put
these on earlier.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.092
It feels... normal.

13:14.094 --> 13:16.094
Okay. What is going on here?

13:16.096 --> 13:19.230
You're being not-Rapunzel!

13:19.232 --> 13:20.598
What do you mean?

13:20.600 --> 13:22.967
Y-You're late!
You're wearing shoes.

13:25.505 --> 13:26.971
Wait, Rapunzel.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.775
Look, we both know
that you haven't
been yourself lately.

13:30.777 --> 13:32.677
Ever since that storm,
you've changed.

13:32.679 --> 13:34.646
You're afraid to take chances,
to shake things up

13:34.648 --> 13:36.181
and live every second
to the fullest.

13:36.183 --> 13:38.583
It's like
you're afraid to be...

13:38.585 --> 13:40.118
you.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.754
-And I miss you.
-(sighs)

13:42.756 --> 13:43.788
Listen.

13:43.790 --> 13:45.990
Listen, I know you had
to make some tough calls

13:45.992 --> 13:47.192
when your parents were gone,

13:47.194 --> 13:48.827
but queen or not,

13:48.829 --> 13:51.162
making difficult choices
is part of life.

13:55.302 --> 13:59.103
<i> -(rhythmic tapping)</i>
-Making difficult choices
is a part of life.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.139
"Part of life"?

14:01.141 --> 14:02.340
Really?

14:02.342 --> 14:04.108
Is me turning
my back on Varian

14:04.110 --> 14:06.377
when he's desperately
begging for my help

14:06.379 --> 14:07.946
part of life?

14:07.948 --> 14:11.216
Is deciding if Pascal
should risk his life

14:11.218 --> 14:13.017
a tough call?

14:13.019 --> 14:14.786
Tell you what, Eugene.

14:14.788 --> 14:16.187
The day
you have to choose

14:16.189 --> 14:18.223
whether to put the entire
fate of a kingdom

14:18.225 --> 14:19.724
in the hands of a fairytale

14:19.726 --> 14:23.194
is the day we can chat
about difficult choices.

14:31.238 --> 14:33.238
Okay, Cass.
This is kind of urgent,

14:33.240 --> 14:35.373
so I don't have time
to insult you right now.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.642
But do you know
what's going on with Rapunzel?

14:37.644 --> 14:39.510
-(squeaks)
-Hey.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.079
That's Rapunzel's tree.

14:41.081 --> 14:42.313
Rapunzel's tree?

14:42.315 --> 14:44.716
These were painted
by Ulf and Friedborg.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.050
Over the last two days,

14:46.052 --> 14:47.518
several people
have gone missing.

14:47.520 --> 14:51.222
Everyone who disappeared
had one thing in common.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.390
(squeaks)

14:52.392 --> 14:54.592
Rapunzel's painting class.

14:59.266 --> 15:00.832
Hmm.

15:00.834 --> 15:03.101
It is as I feared.

15:20.520 --> 15:24.455
(rhythmic tapping)

15:24.457 --> 15:28.159
Can I help you
find something, dear?

15:33.199 --> 15:35.433
Sugarby:
<i> Rapunzel. Rapunzel.</i>

15:36.870 --> 15:38.970
<i> It is time!</i>

15:42.609 --> 15:45.910
Um, usually, I'd enjoy
you keeping your mouth shut,

15:45.912 --> 15:48.780
I mean obviously,
but do you wanna tell me
what's going on?

15:48.782 --> 15:50.281
I don't know,

15:50.283 --> 15:51.883
but we need answers.

15:51.885 --> 15:54.819
There's more to this
Sugarby than-- (gasps)

15:54.821 --> 15:56.854
(muffled speaking)

15:58.258 --> 15:59.557
Xavier!

16:00.727 --> 16:02.994
-(gasps)
-What happened?

16:02.996 --> 16:04.062
Sugarby.

16:04.064 --> 16:06.264
She's not what
she says she is.

16:06.266 --> 16:09.334
Yeah, way ahead of you
on that one, Zave.

16:09.336 --> 16:12.236
No. She's worse
than you can imagine.

16:12.238 --> 16:15.273
Cassandra, when we used
the Demanitus Device

16:15.275 --> 16:17.141
to stop the great storm,

16:17.143 --> 16:19.410
we unwittingly
freed something.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.179
Something terrible.

16:21.181 --> 16:24.248
The disciples of Zhan Tiri.

16:24.250 --> 16:27.251
Zhan Tiri? You mean
the ancient, evil sorcerer?

16:27.253 --> 16:28.486
Way to go, Cassandra.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.122
Lord Demanitus
was in a constant battle

16:31.124 --> 16:33.691
with Zhan Tiri
and his brethren.

16:33.693 --> 16:37.962
Over the years,
Demanitus captured
many of the evil spirits

16:37.964 --> 16:40.164
and held them prisoner
in that chamber.

16:40.166 --> 16:41.666
So what you're saying

16:41.668 --> 16:43.601
is that when
we used this device,

16:43.603 --> 16:46.371
we may have freed
one of those evil spirits and--

16:46.373 --> 16:48.172
And now,
one of those minions

16:48.174 --> 16:50.375
is trying to free
their master.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.810
I'm afraid she's going
to use the princess

16:52.812 --> 16:54.379
and the others to do it.

16:54.381 --> 16:57.382
Rapunzel is in grave danger.

16:57.384 --> 17:00.618
(ominous music plays)

17:00.620 --> 17:04.055
It's time
for your final project.

17:14.968 --> 17:16.467
(horses panting)

17:16.469 --> 17:18.369
-Are you sure
it's this way?
-Yes!

17:18.371 --> 17:20.204
Xavier said
Sugarby's ceremony

17:20.206 --> 17:22.640
would take place
at Janus Point.

17:22.642 --> 17:23.908
-Hyah!
-(horse neighs)

17:28.348 --> 17:29.747
Sugarby:
Go ahead, Princess.

17:31.084 --> 17:33.351
By painting this idol exactly,

17:33.353 --> 17:36.521
you are pledging
your allegiance to Zhan Tiri.

17:36.523 --> 17:39.157
And it will be that allegiance

17:39.159 --> 17:41.559
that frees our master

17:41.561 --> 17:44.062
from his otherworldly prison!

17:44.998 --> 17:46.697
But... I can't.

17:46.699 --> 17:48.232
(blows)

17:48.234 --> 17:50.334
Rapunzel, dear.

17:50.336 --> 17:53.571
I know all
those difficult things
you've encountered.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.407
Darling, I promise

17:56.409 --> 17:58.443
you'll never have to make

17:58.445 --> 18:02.213
those kind of decisions again.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.749
(rhythmic tapping)

18:16.529 --> 18:18.629
Yes! That's it!

18:18.631 --> 18:22.200
Once this totem has been
recreated five times,

18:22.202 --> 18:23.468
the portal shall open,

18:23.470 --> 18:28.106
and Zhan Tiri
shall again be free!

18:31.077 --> 18:32.443
(energy surging)

18:35.415 --> 18:37.048
It's working!

18:37.050 --> 18:40.485
Oh! You are just
a terrible teacher!

18:40.487 --> 18:42.220
Let her go, Sugarby.

18:42.222 --> 18:43.821
Please, Sugarby was merely

18:43.823 --> 18:46.157
the vessel I chose
to suit my purpose.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.494
I am Sugracha the Eternal,

18:49.496 --> 18:52.563
and I can take so many forms.

18:52.565 --> 18:55.500
Uh, any chance we can stick
with the sweet old-lady form?

18:55.502 --> 18:57.268
Cause I'm kind
of missing her already.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.604
Eugene, you get Rapunzel
to snap out of it.

18:59.606 --> 19:00.805
Hyah!

19:00.807 --> 19:03.641
-(sword zings)
-I'll handle the witch.

19:05.111 --> 19:06.377
(shrieks)

19:11.351 --> 19:12.617
Blondie, it's me.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.519
Eu-- Eugene?

19:14.521 --> 19:16.154
(growls)

19:17.323 --> 19:18.589
(shrieks)

19:18.591 --> 19:20.691
Whoa! Aah!

19:20.693 --> 19:22.527
(both shouting)

19:25.131 --> 19:27.131
Well, way to handle
the witch, Cassandra.

19:27.133 --> 19:28.966
You were supposed
to help Rapunzel!

19:28.968 --> 19:30.568
Now is not the time
to point fingers!

19:31.638 --> 19:34.405
Don't let them fall. Please.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.508
My dear, whether
or not they fall

19:37.510 --> 19:39.644
is completely up to you.

19:39.646 --> 19:42.513
Finish my spell,
and I'll spare them.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.148
(tapping)

19:44.150 --> 19:45.950
The choice is yours.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.353
Think about
how much simpler

19:49.355 --> 19:51.489
and easier
everything could be

19:51.491 --> 19:53.457
if you just finish
that painting.

19:53.459 --> 19:55.159
No more self-doubt.

19:55.161 --> 19:56.527
No more regret.

19:56.529 --> 19:59.564
No more difficult choices.

19:59.566 --> 20:02.533
Give in to Zhan Tiri.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.235
-(electricity zapping)
-Rapunzel.

20:04.237 --> 20:05.503
You've got to stop.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.438
I know you can
hear me. Please!

20:10.376 --> 20:12.143
Difficult choices

20:12.145 --> 20:14.078
are what make us who we are.

20:15.014 --> 20:16.280
-(grunts)
-(ripping)

20:17.250 --> 20:18.449
No!

20:27.927 --> 20:29.594
(shouts)
What have you done?

20:29.596 --> 20:31.162
(neighing)

20:31.164 --> 20:32.663
-(nickers)
-(whinnies)

20:33.700 --> 20:35.600
-No!
-(whinnying)

20:36.603 --> 20:37.802
(screams)

20:42.508 --> 20:44.175
-(both yelling)
-No!

20:46.679 --> 20:47.912
(grunts)

20:47.914 --> 20:49.614
(screaming continues)

20:51.084 --> 20:53.017
(grunting)

20:54.454 --> 20:55.886
No!

20:55.888 --> 20:58.322
-(grunting)
-(squeaks)

21:04.597 --> 21:05.696
(laughs)

21:05.698 --> 21:07.198
(neighing)

21:08.568 --> 21:10.067
Come on, Max!

21:10.069 --> 21:11.502
Pull!

21:12.438 --> 21:14.472
(grunting)

21:16.442 --> 21:17.541
Eugene:
Oh!

21:26.119 --> 21:27.618
It's good to have
you back, Blondie.

21:28.588 --> 21:31.489
It's good to
be back, Eugene.

21:31.491 --> 21:34.425
I just thought of a great idea
for the mural. Come on!

21:34.427 --> 21:37.561
Eugene:
Oh? Re-- oh, now?

21:37.563 --> 21:39.297
Not-- not later, you know,
when it's light out.

21:39.299 --> 21:42.066
That's fine.
I'm not gonna question
the creative process.

21:43.403 --> 21:45.670
(bell pealing)

21:48.441 --> 21:50.608
Wow! Lookin' great, Blondie.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.677
I suppose your
painter's block
is gone for good.

21:52.679 --> 21:56.414
I sure hope so,
but if it ever does come back,

21:56.416 --> 21:59.750
I've decided not
to fight it all by myself.

22:07.694 --> 22:10.695
(theme music playing)

22:10.697 --> 22:13.631
<i> ¶ Now I got my eyes open</i>
<i> and wide ¶</i>

22:13.633 --> 22:16.267
<i> ¶ My heart burnin' like fire ¶</i>

22:16.269 --> 22:18.436
<i> ¶ Feels like I'm so alive ¶</i>

22:18.438 --> 22:20.304
<i> ¶ I'm never goin' back ¶</i>

22:20.306 --> 22:23.140
<i> ¶ Whatever I want now,</i>
<i> I'm gonna chase ¶</i>

22:23.142 --> 22:25.643
<i> ¶ Who I am,</i>
<i> I can't contain it ¶</i>

22:25.645 --> 22:28.979
<i> ¶ I'm not gonna hold it in ¶</i>

22:28.981 --> 22:31.015
<i> ¶ 'Cause there's more of me</i>
<i> to give ¶</i>

22:32.518 --> 22:33.984
<i> ¶ Oh yeah ¶</i>

22:33.986 --> 22:36.354
<i> ¶ There's more of me to give ¶</i>
