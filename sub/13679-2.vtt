00:01.813 --> 00:04.014
<i>Previously on</i> American Gothic...

00:04.038 --> 00:06.912
Stunning break tonight in the
case of the elusive serial killer

00:06.937 --> 00:08.507
<i>known as "Silver Bells."</i>

00:08.586 --> 00:10.843
<i>It's the biggest
lead</i> on this case in years.

00:10.945 --> 00:14.847
<i>Killer known for his eerie
calling card: small, silver handbell.</i>

00:14.849 --> 00:18.386
<i>Our dad?</i> Has to be
some kind of sick joke.

00:18.680 --> 00:22.448
Silver Bells murders
stopped 14 years ago.

00:22.450 --> 00:24.917
Do you remember what else
happened 14 years ago?

00:24.919 --> 00:25.785
Garrett left.

00:25.787 --> 00:27.086
Hey, little sister.

00:27.088 --> 00:28.387
What did you hear him say?

00:28.389 --> 00:31.023
I'm gonna tell him it was you.

00:31.025 --> 00:32.525
We have to tell the truth.

00:32.527 --> 00:33.826
I love you.

00:39.109 --> 00:42.576
There's been some tough stuff...
with my family.

00:43.998 --> 00:46.832
But I've been good, you know?
I really have.

00:48.767 --> 00:50.034
Until last night.

00:50.036 --> 00:51.502
I buckled. I called Rick.

00:51.504 --> 00:52.673
That's my dealer.

00:52.767 --> 00:55.634
They're always named
Rick, it seems like.

00:57.637 --> 01:01.474
Anyway, I called him, you
know the rest, so...

01:03.744 --> 01:06.479
My sobriety starts over today.

01:08.782 --> 01:10.149
Yeah.

01:10.151 --> 01:15.488
See, you can't keep Domino's on
speed dial when you're on a diet.

01:16.590 --> 01:19.825
Delete Rick's number from
your phone, brother.

01:19.827 --> 01:22.528
Yeah, I'll do that.

01:24.164 --> 01:26.031
I'll watch.

01:29.537 --> 01:30.836
Ah, phone's dead.

01:30.838 --> 01:32.805
Charger.

02:18.685 --> 02:20.653
Maybe we should try Cam again.

02:21.852 --> 02:26.649
I've called him five times from a few
different numbers in case he's screening.

02:29.964 --> 02:32.598
It's just Brady.

02:32.600 --> 02:34.767
Checking on me.

02:36.870 --> 02:39.471
Tom and I haven't figured
out how to tell the twins.

02:42.376 --> 02:44.443
Where did Garrett go?

02:44.445 --> 02:47.680
I told him, then he said
he was going for a walk.

02:47.682 --> 02:50.883
That was at about 8:00 this morning.

02:55.222 --> 02:58.791
- Where were you? You lied.
- My cell phone was dead. I'm sorry.

02:58.793 --> 03:02.528
If you had gone to the
hospital like you said,

03:02.530 --> 03:05.631
Mom wouldn't have been alone when...

03:08.001 --> 03:11.971
We should talk about
planning the funeral.

03:11.973 --> 03:13.372
Without Mom?

03:13.374 --> 03:15.441
- Where...
- She's taking a bath.

03:17.844 --> 03:21.580
Be good to save her the trouble, anyway.

03:21.582 --> 03:26.085
Um, I called St. Paul's Church
about having the service there

03:26.087 --> 03:29.755
and then a reception here afterward.

03:29.757 --> 03:33.826
We should probably limit the guest list,
'cause everyone's gonna want to come.

03:33.828 --> 03:35.294
Yeah.

03:35.296 --> 03:37.429
Everyone loved Dad.

03:39.132 --> 03:41.934
What...

03:41.936 --> 03:43.802
Why are you so...

03:43.804 --> 03:44.837
What?

03:44.839 --> 03:46.739
Our father is dead,

03:46.741 --> 03:48.240
and not a single tear.

03:48.242 --> 03:50.042
Whoa.

03:50.044 --> 03:51.977
No, you I can understand, but Tess...

03:51.979 --> 03:53.445
Okay, Alison's grief coordinator.

03:53.447 --> 03:54.847
Oh, come on.

03:54.849 --> 03:55.948
It's a self-appointed position.

03:55.950 --> 03:57.483
How many tears should we cry?

03:57.485 --> 03:59.551
- Will ten suffice?
- Look, I'm sorry.

03:59.553 --> 04:03.155
I can't bury our dad until
I have some answers.

04:03.157 --> 04:07.293
- About what?
- You know what.

04:07.295 --> 04:10.162
The box we found in the shed.

04:11.865 --> 04:13.732
<i>Is this about Silver Bells?</i>

04:13.734 --> 04:16.769
'Cause I'm on this case now, so I
should probably be here if it is.

04:16.771 --> 04:19.305
Newly minted Detective Ross.

04:19.307 --> 04:21.940
Brother-in-law of city councilor
Alison Hawthorne-Price.

04:21.942 --> 04:23.475
I'm sure she didn't pull any strings.

04:26.346 --> 04:29.448
Hang on.

04:29.450 --> 04:31.350
Why don't you, uh, take
us through a briefing

04:31.352 --> 04:32.985
on the Silver Bells murders?

04:32.987 --> 04:35.454
Okay.

04:35.456 --> 04:37.656
Sure.

04:43.930 --> 04:47.800
The Silver Bells Killer
committed six murders

04:47.802 --> 04:52.304
between 1999 and 2002.

04:52.306 --> 04:55.341
The victims are all members
of Boston's wealthy elite.

04:56.976 --> 04:59.812
Consistent M.O.:
strangulation with a belt.

04:59.814 --> 05:04.717
He carefully posed each corpse in a
chair like a dead king on his throne.

05:04.719 --> 05:10.089
And next to each body he
placed a single silver bell.

05:10.091 --> 05:11.790
Now, the working theory is that SBK

05:11.792 --> 05:14.993
had a deeply ingrained
resentment of wealth and power.

05:14.995 --> 05:19.531
SBK saw himself as some sort of a
mascot of a populist uprising.

05:19.533 --> 05:21.500
Then he stopped.

05:21.502 --> 05:24.236
Maybe he decided to quit
while he was ahead.

05:24.238 --> 05:26.839
Maybe he knew that we didn't
have a shred of evidence

05:26.841 --> 05:28.574
to help us find him.

05:28.576 --> 05:32.244
But that all changed last
week in the tunnel collapse.

05:33.546 --> 05:37.683
This high-end leather belt
was found in the rubble.

05:37.685 --> 05:39.918
It is the first SBK murder
weapon ever recovered.

05:39.920 --> 05:43.288
Now, in addition to the
paint on the belt,

05:43.290 --> 05:44.623
forensics managed to pull a fingerprint,

05:44.625 --> 05:46.091
which was matched to David Morales,

05:46.093 --> 05:47.860
SBK's final victim,

05:47.862 --> 05:50.362
and a faint blood stain,
which didn't match Morales.

05:50.364 --> 05:52.398
Now, we believe that the
belt belonged to Morales,

05:52.400 --> 05:54.366
which we're gonna confirm
with his next of kin.

05:54.368 --> 05:57.403
We believe the blood
belonged to SBK himself.

05:57.405 --> 06:00.005
It's most likely that he disposed
of the belt in the concrete

06:00.007 --> 06:01.974
thinking it would never resurface,

06:01.976 --> 06:03.909
so our best bet is to compile
a list of all the workers

06:03.911 --> 06:06.445
who were on-site the day the
concrete panel was poured.

06:06.447 --> 06:08.280
Those are our suspects.

06:10.650 --> 06:13.152
Thanks for the warm welcome.

06:13.154 --> 06:16.121
What exactly is it you
think you're gonna do?

06:16.123 --> 06:17.589
Hold on. Gunther.

06:17.591 --> 06:21.493
- Give us a minute?
- Right.

06:21.495 --> 06:23.362
Sure, right.

06:23.364 --> 06:27.232
<i>I want to show Brady</i> one of the
bells, so he can tell us if it's real.

06:27.234 --> 06:29.134
No, absolutely not.

06:34.741 --> 06:37.409
The last thing we need is to
tell a cop about the bells.

06:37.411 --> 06:39.411
- Not a cop, my husband.
- We agreed

06:39.413 --> 06:41.513
we'd keep this between us until
we know what we're dealing with.

06:41.515 --> 06:42.881
Back me up here.

06:42.883 --> 06:44.183
I-I'm not on anyone's side, okay?

06:44.185 --> 06:47.152
I don't want to bury it, but I
don't want to come forward either.

06:47.154 --> 06:48.654
I just want it to not exist.

06:48.656 --> 06:49.888
Not helpful.

06:49.890 --> 06:51.990
The sooner we find out what's going on,

06:51.992 --> 06:54.860
the sooner we can lay Dad to rest.

06:54.862 --> 06:57.029
Wait a minute.

06:57.031 --> 06:59.298
Where's the box?

06:59.300 --> 07:00.699
Wasn't it right there?

07:00.701 --> 07:02.100
You said you wouldn't move it.

07:02.102 --> 07:04.269
No, we didn't touch it.
How could it just...

07:04.271 --> 07:06.872
If you're
looking for the bells...

07:06.874 --> 07:09.475
they're gone.

07:10.421 --> 07:12.687
- sync and corrections by Caio -
- www.addic7ed.com -

07:22.116 --> 07:26.286
Your father was always interested
in true crime stories, do you remember?

07:26.726 --> 07:28.192
Right, of course.

07:28.217 --> 07:30.851
He watched <i>Unsolved
Mysteries</i> religiously,

07:30.853 --> 07:33.587
and he always had a theory.

07:33.589 --> 07:36.524
"The nanny did it,
Mad, I'm telling you."

07:39.294 --> 07:44.765
But that true crime hobby
had taken a turn lately

07:44.767 --> 07:49.170
because he was... slipping.

07:49.172 --> 07:51.238
Wha...

07:51.240 --> 07:53.274
What do you mean?

07:53.276 --> 07:54.542
Dementia.

07:54.544 --> 07:56.177
What?

07:56.179 --> 07:59.413
He did a pretty good job hiding it.

07:59.415 --> 08:01.015
But he was sundowning.

08:01.017 --> 08:04.618
Mornings were fine, but by evening,

08:04.620 --> 08:06.687
he started to deteriorate.

08:06.689 --> 08:09.490
The last few weeks were...

08:09.492 --> 08:11.859
really bad.

08:11.861 --> 08:14.195
Oh, Mom.

08:14.197 --> 08:16.597
About a week ago,

08:16.599 --> 08:18.966
I found him out in the shed.

08:18.968 --> 08:22.636
He was disoriented, he called me Mary,

08:22.638 --> 08:25.005
his sister's name, and he said,

08:25.007 --> 08:30.511
"Mary, I think I'm a bad guy."

08:30.513 --> 08:32.513
And then he showed me that box.

08:32.515 --> 08:38.184
He'd found all the old articles
he'd saved from years ago,

08:38.187 --> 08:42.089
and those dumb collectible bells
that he must've gotten off of

08:42.091 --> 08:44.325
some murder memorabilia site.

08:44.327 --> 08:45.593
But his brain

08:45.595 --> 08:47.561
was failing him,

08:47.563 --> 08:51.399
and he'd started to think it was him.

08:51.401 --> 08:54.502
That he was the Silver Bells Killer.

08:54.504 --> 08:56.337
Oh, God.

08:56.339 --> 08:58.773
Mom?

08:59.808 --> 09:01.342
- Are you sure...
- Am I sure what?

09:01.344 --> 09:04.412
That he was losing his mind? Yes.

09:04.414 --> 09:05.880
Are you sure that he wasn't...

09:05.882 --> 09:08.048
A serial killer?

09:10.452 --> 09:13.421
I won't even dignify
that with a response.

09:13.423 --> 09:17.858
I just lost my husband of 38 years,

09:17.860 --> 09:21.929
and the only thing that I have
a tiny sliver of gratitude for

09:21.931 --> 09:26.634
is that he went before this bizarre
delusion could go any further.

09:26.636 --> 09:31.639
He could've brought down the
whole family with this nonsense.

09:31.641 --> 09:34.842
And that would have been
his worst nightmare.

09:34.844 --> 09:37.645
So where is it now?

09:37.647 --> 09:39.313
The box.

09:39.315 --> 09:41.015
It's gone.

09:41.017 --> 09:43.818
I had Gunther get rid of...

09:43.820 --> 09:45.052
all that old stuff from the shed.

09:52.594 --> 09:57.364
Not spouses, not long-lost siblings.

09:57.366 --> 10:00.868
It's our responsibility to
keep Dad's legacy intact.

10:02.404 --> 10:05.039
Thank you.

10:10.145 --> 10:16.250
So, we'll do the visitation, the
service, followed by cremation.

10:16.252 --> 10:18.419
Per his wishes.

10:20.889 --> 10:22.590
I'd like to speak at the service.

10:22.592 --> 10:23.958
Of course.

10:23.960 --> 10:26.193
What about me?

10:30.799 --> 10:32.366
I want to speak at the funeral.

10:33.802 --> 10:36.504
I have something to say.

10:48.617 --> 10:53.721
I think it's better if I speak
on behalf of the whole family.

10:57.793 --> 10:59.393
I disagree.

11:04.633 --> 11:06.600
I'm here about Caramel.

11:06.602 --> 11:08.402
Something's happened to his tail.

11:08.404 --> 11:12.006
It's been sewed up, but
something happened, I know it.

11:12.008 --> 11:14.842
I suspect an incident
of animal mutilation.

11:16.444 --> 11:20.180
Perhaps someone in your
family saw something.

11:20.182 --> 11:21.415
Phyllis,

11:21.417 --> 11:23.284
do you remember my husband Mitchell?

11:23.286 --> 11:25.286
Tall guy, gray hair.

11:25.288 --> 11:26.754
He's dead.

11:26.756 --> 11:28.989
Good luck with your cat.

11:32.094 --> 11:33.661
Hello?

11:33.663 --> 11:35.296
This is Renee from
Fisher Hill Hospital.

11:35.298 --> 11:38.599
My apologies for bothering you, Mrs.
Hawthorne, on such a difficult day,

11:38.601 --> 11:41.702
but we need to discuss an issue
related to Mr. Hawthorne's passing,

11:41.704 --> 11:43.103
and it just can't wait.

11:43.105 --> 11:44.872
What is this about?

11:44.874 --> 11:49.243
There were some irregularities in
the machine tracking his vitals.

11:49.245 --> 11:52.646
It's important we discuss this
in person, as soon as possible.

11:52.648 --> 11:54.682
You just caught us by surprise.

11:54.684 --> 11:57.551
Showing up.

11:57.553 --> 11:59.787
After 14 years.

11:59.789 --> 12:02.923
Yeah, I should have called.

12:06.728 --> 12:08.696
What's your agenda here?

12:08.698 --> 12:10.864
My agenda?

12:10.866 --> 12:12.733
Violet said something

12:12.735 --> 12:15.135
strange last night.

12:15.137 --> 12:18.472
She said she heard you say to Dad,

12:18.474 --> 12:21.075
"I'm gonna tell them it was you."

12:21.077 --> 12:24.678
Well, she's, what, five?

12:24.680 --> 12:26.780
And likes pretending

12:26.782 --> 12:28.182
to be a slug.

12:28.184 --> 12:30.050
Maybe she's not the
most reliable source.

12:30.052 --> 12:33.454
You vanish for a decade and a half,

12:33.456 --> 12:36.857
show back up to watch Dad die,

12:36.859 --> 12:41.795
then disappear on "walks" for hours.

12:41.797 --> 12:46.233
Did you have a specific
itinerary for me?

12:46.235 --> 12:48.102
Maybe a duck tour?

12:48.104 --> 12:50.938
Do you get the sense you're wanted here?

12:52.575 --> 12:54.308
Not to worry, sis.

12:54.310 --> 12:56.510
I'm leaving.

12:56.512 --> 12:58.712
Right after the funeral.

12:58.714 --> 13:02.349
What is it you want to
say at the service?

13:02.351 --> 13:06.086
Oh, I just want to share
a few special memories.

13:06.088 --> 13:08.288
A few favorite quotes.

13:09.991 --> 13:12.393
If you have something you want to say,

13:12.395 --> 13:15.996
just feel free to share it with me now.

13:15.998 --> 13:19.500
You're a politician, Alison.

13:19.502 --> 13:21.301
You know the benefits

13:21.303 --> 13:26.040
of reaching a large audience
with your message, right?

13:26.042 --> 13:29.476
Now, if you're finished with me,

13:29.478 --> 13:33.113
I would like to take one
of my long weird walks.

13:44.659 --> 13:47.027
He cannot speak at the memorial.

13:47.029 --> 13:48.328
What do you mean?

13:48.330 --> 13:49.663
Care to hear his opening quote?

13:49.665 --> 13:51.331
"In all ages, the people have honored

13:51.333 --> 13:53.000
"those who dishonored them.

13:53.002 --> 13:56.036
"They have canonized the
most gigantic liars

13:56.038 --> 13:58.138
"and buried the great
thieves in marble and gold.

13:58.140 --> 14:01.975
Under the loftiest monuments
sleeps the dust of murder..."

14:01.977 --> 14:03.610
That's enough.

14:03.612 --> 14:04.812
Sounds like he's gonna

14:04.814 --> 14:06.246
accuse Dad of something horrible.

14:06.248 --> 14:07.781
Why? Why would he do that?

14:07.783 --> 14:09.183
I don't know.

14:09.185 --> 14:12.152
They had that horrible
fight before he left.

14:12.154 --> 14:15.022
Because Garrett didn't want
to join the family company?

14:15.398 --> 14:17.998
Th-That's a mild grudge.
This is a vendetta.

14:20.228 --> 14:25.065
I don't know what ax he has to grind, but
clearly we can't let him do it in public.

14:25.067 --> 14:29.002
Do you think... he's the one
who did something horrible,

14:29.004 --> 14:32.673
and now he's gonna blame Dad for it?

14:33.824 --> 14:38.792
Is it possible... that
box in the shed...?

14:38.817 --> 14:41.985
No. It can't be.

14:42.751 --> 14:44.985
<i>Hmm, critical error.</i>

14:44.987 --> 14:46.353
What?

14:46.355 --> 14:48.455
Your list of workers present

14:48.457 --> 14:50.023
- the day the concrete panel was poured.
- Yeah?

14:50.025 --> 14:51.825
It only included laborers,
not supervisors.

14:51.827 --> 14:54.261
Yeah, because SBK's profile says
he's poor and disenfranchised.

14:54.263 --> 14:55.796
Supervisors are well compensated.

14:55.798 --> 14:57.798
Thing is, profile is an assumption,

14:57.800 --> 14:59.600
and you know what they
say about assumptions.

14:59.602 --> 15:01.001
Oh, do you not know that one?

15:01.003 --> 15:02.436
See, the idea is when you assume...

15:02.438 --> 15:04.538
- I'll redo the list.
- Oh, no need.

15:04.540 --> 15:06.540
I did it for you.

15:12.947 --> 15:15.149
Mitchell Hawthorne?

15:15.151 --> 15:16.717
He's dead.

15:16.719 --> 15:19.119
I want his DNA sample by end of day.

15:19.121 --> 15:21.555
You're not serious. You want
Mitchell Hawthorne's DNA?

15:21.557 --> 15:22.890
As soon as possible.

15:22.892 --> 15:24.358
The guy was CEO of the company.

15:24.360 --> 15:25.893
And he was on-site that day.

15:25.895 --> 15:27.828
And if a lamp goes missing
from the White House,

15:27.830 --> 15:29.530
and they make a list of everyone

15:29.532 --> 15:31.231
who was in the White
House when it happened,

15:31.233 --> 15:32.933
the president is gonna be on that list.

15:32.935 --> 15:34.468
You really think that he's the burglar?

15:34.470 --> 15:35.836
We talking Kennedy or Nixon?

15:35.838 --> 15:37.037
Okay.

15:37.039 --> 15:39.006
- I'll take care of it.
- When?

15:39.008 --> 15:40.674
I'm gonna need a few days.

15:40.676 --> 15:42.376
Once the body is buried,
we lose our best shot

15:42.378 --> 15:44.111
- at a good sample.
- What do you want me to do?

15:44.113 --> 15:45.579
You want me to open up the casket,

15:45.581 --> 15:47.014
pull a hair off the corpse?

15:47.016 --> 15:48.415
This shouldn't be that hard

15:48.417 --> 15:50.684
considering you married into the family.

15:50.686 --> 15:52.719
Look, I am not gonna march
in and ask my mother-in-law

15:52.721 --> 15:54.154
for a DNA sample to prove

15:54.156 --> 15:56.290
that her husband wasn't a serial killer

15:56.292 --> 15:58.358
on the day she is laying him to rest.

15:58.360 --> 16:00.761
I see your point.

16:00.763 --> 16:02.262
Yeah.

16:02.264 --> 16:04.364
I'll do it myself.

16:04.366 --> 16:05.899
No. No, I'll do it.

16:07.001 --> 16:08.769
I will get a toothbrush or something,

16:08.771 --> 16:11.705
and then we can rule Mitchell
out, we can move on.

16:11.707 --> 16:13.440
Super.

16:23.768 --> 16:27.291
So where's his body? Grandpa's, I mean.

16:27.315 --> 16:30.112
Because based on a postmortem
timeline I looked up,

16:30.285 --> 16:33.286
rigor mortis has
definitely set in by now.

16:33.288 --> 16:35.722
I mean, he's probably like...

16:38.693 --> 16:40.894
Or...

16:42.696 --> 16:45.131
You know? So where is he?

16:45.133 --> 16:46.933
Sometimes they drain the blood

16:46.935 --> 16:48.368
and replace it with 'balming fluid.

16:48.370 --> 16:50.503
That way it smells less bad.

16:50.505 --> 16:52.839
Do you think they let
kids in the morgue?

16:52.841 --> 16:54.808
- 'Cause I've never seen a...
- Sit tight.

16:54.810 --> 16:57.076
Uh, I was supposed to
find out if you have

16:57.078 --> 16:58.978
any dietary restrictions.

16:58.980 --> 17:01.181
Caterers need to know.

17:07.823 --> 17:10.022
I am pretty sick of squirrel.

17:11.759 --> 17:15.862
So I guess anything but
squirrel would be fine.

17:16.964 --> 17:19.199
Did you know at this stage,

17:19.201 --> 17:20.767
Grandpa's fingernails

17:20.769 --> 17:22.669
probably look like
they're getting longer?

17:22.671 --> 17:24.637
Because of dehydration.

17:24.638 --> 17:26.839
Like this.

17:26.842 --> 17:28.775
That's right, little man.

17:28.777 --> 17:31.077
Same thing happens to dead squirrels.

17:31.079 --> 17:33.813
Please don't encourage this.

17:33.815 --> 17:35.748
Apple doesn't fall far from the tree,

17:35.750 --> 17:37.917
does it, Cam? Huh?

17:41.722 --> 17:44.424
You had a dark streak, too.

17:49.296 --> 17:50.964
Come on, Jack.

17:51.799 --> 17:53.533
Do you think his mouth is open?

17:53.535 --> 17:55.001
And if it is, do you think it stinks?

17:55.003 --> 17:56.769
You think it smells bad?

17:56.771 --> 17:58.104
Is the casket open?

17:58.106 --> 17:59.572
Are his eyes open?

17:59.574 --> 18:00.740
Because if they are, they're probably...

18:00.742 --> 18:02.809
Listen to me. Listen to me.

18:02.811 --> 18:07.680
Everyone's very sad because
they won't see Grandpa again.

18:09.450 --> 18:12.452
What about the funeral, in the casket?

18:12.454 --> 18:15.121
They won't see him alive again.

18:17.958 --> 18:21.127
Look, like this.

18:25.021 --> 18:29.583
They won't be able to talk to
him, to ask him for advice,

18:30.605 --> 18:35.642
to give him a hug. It's very sad.

18:37.778 --> 18:40.480
Couldn't we still hug his corpse?

18:44.785 --> 18:47.287
<i>Can someone else in
your family deal with this?</i>

18:47.289 --> 18:49.322
Shoo him away nicely?

18:49.324 --> 18:51.724
My mom's grief-stricken.

18:51.726 --> 18:54.427
Cam's wrapped up in his own demons.

18:54.429 --> 18:57.397
And when Tessa looks at Garrett,
all she sees is the big brother

18:57.399 --> 18:59.532
who took her ice-skating
at the frog pond.

18:59.534 --> 19:02.669
To make things worse, we've
given Kerry Treadwell

19:02.671 --> 19:06.105
exclusive press access at the service.
It seemed like a boon at the time.

19:06.107 --> 19:07.740
Yeah, but the story needs to be

19:07.742 --> 19:09.576
your eloquent heartfelt eulogy,

19:09.578 --> 19:12.779
not whatever that loose-cannon
lumberjack dreams up.

19:12.781 --> 19:16.215
But we can't stop him
from getting up there

19:16.217 --> 19:17.784
if he's hell-bent on it.

19:17.786 --> 19:20.153
We could borrow from the Republicans'

19:20.155 --> 19:23.256
voter suppression tactics and
require IDs at the door.

19:23.258 --> 19:25.758
There's no way Garrett
has a current license.

19:30.664 --> 19:32.265
Are you okay?

19:35.202 --> 19:40.139
I can't begin to imagine

19:40.141 --> 19:43.343
how much you miss him.

20:05.199 --> 20:07.200
Oh, sorry to
disturb you, Miss Tessa.

20:07.202 --> 20:08.635
Oh.

20:08.637 --> 20:10.770
No, please, Gunther.

20:10.772 --> 20:12.639
Keep me company.

20:12.641 --> 20:15.942
I'm just looking at photos
to display at the reception.

20:15.944 --> 20:18.645
He never let me win.

20:22.916 --> 20:26.919
Yeah, well, it's like our
chess matches, right?

20:26.921 --> 20:29.656
Every once in a while, I
beat him fair and square,

20:29.658 --> 20:30.957
but he never let me.

20:33.061 --> 20:35.728
I remember those chess battles
from when I was little.

20:35.730 --> 20:38.631
Yeah, we were still playing
every Thursday night.

20:38.633 --> 20:41.601
Even last week.

20:41.603 --> 20:43.136
You played Thursday nights?

20:43.138 --> 20:44.737
Yeah.

20:46.206 --> 20:47.573
Hey, Gunther,

20:47.575 --> 20:50.643
when you played, did you ever notice...

20:50.645 --> 20:52.478
my dad seeming a little confused

20:52.480 --> 20:53.646
or out of sorts?

20:53.648 --> 20:55.081
No.

20:55.083 --> 20:56.916
No, you can't pull off a French Defense

20:56.918 --> 20:58.317
if you're not sharp as a tack, right?

20:59.487 --> 21:00.920
Right.

21:03.424 --> 21:05.992
As I mentioned, we found

21:05.994 --> 21:07.860
some odd data with your husband's vitals

21:07.862 --> 21:09.462
before he passed away.

21:09.464 --> 21:11.564
I see.

21:11.566 --> 21:14.100
We believe, based on irregular readings

21:14.102 --> 21:16.069
from his O-sat monitor,

21:16.071 --> 21:18.104
there was possibly a
machine malfunction.

21:19.973 --> 21:21.307
Your family's donations

21:21.309 --> 21:22.975
helped build this place.

21:22.977 --> 21:24.577
We will always be grateful,

21:24.579 --> 21:26.512
even if you decide to bring a lawsuit.

21:26.514 --> 21:29.415
No, no.

21:29.417 --> 21:32.552
Clearly, there was no
intentional wrongdoing here.

21:32.554 --> 21:34.854
Still, uh, we don't want this
to happen to anyone else.

21:34.856 --> 21:37.256
That's why I think it would
be best if we do an autopsy,

21:37.258 --> 21:39.025
so that we can get a full picture

21:39.027 --> 21:40.460
of exactly what happened.

21:42.563 --> 21:45.331
The body's already been
released to the funeral home.

21:45.333 --> 21:47.700
We'd need your consent to get it back.

21:47.702 --> 21:49.469
Yes, of course.

21:49.471 --> 21:52.305
I'll call them myself and
make sure it's not too late.

21:52.307 --> 21:54.574
There's been
a change of plans.

21:54.576 --> 21:57.443
There'll no longer be an open casket.

21:57.445 --> 22:00.913
Body should be sent directly to
the crematory for incineration.

22:56.068 --> 22:57.101
Hey.

22:57.103 --> 23:00.138
Hey.

23:01.091 --> 23:01.916
You doing okay?

23:02.916 --> 23:05.434
Why am I curling my hair?

23:06.098 --> 23:08.031
Is this day gonna be any better or worse

23:08.056 --> 23:11.491
if I have waves gently
cascading down my shoulders?

23:11.493 --> 23:14.348
Well, you know, certain rituals
can be comforting sometimes.

23:14.795 --> 23:16.696
I guess.

23:20.635 --> 23:22.135
It's weird.

23:22.137 --> 23:24.303
I noticed your dad's stuff

23:24.305 --> 23:27.940
seems to be disappearing
from the house already.

23:27.942 --> 23:30.810
Yeah. That's what Mom does in grief.

23:30.812 --> 23:33.813
That's her ritual.

23:33.815 --> 23:35.882
It's too painful to see

23:35.884 --> 23:38.785
all the constant reminders
around the house.

23:38.787 --> 23:41.254
She did the same thing
when our dog died.

23:41.256 --> 23:43.556
Removed every trace of him.

23:46.694 --> 23:47.827
You know what?

23:47.829 --> 23:49.295
I'm ready before everyone else.

23:49.297 --> 23:50.930
I'm gonna head down to the church early

23:50.932 --> 23:53.166
and see if there's anything
I can do to help set up.

23:53.168 --> 23:54.233
You know.

23:54.235 --> 23:56.202
That's sweet of you. Thanks.

24:10.184 --> 24:11.584
All right.

24:11.586 --> 24:14.954
Go put your jacket on.

24:20.060 --> 24:22.261
Why is there no un-delete?

24:35.008 --> 24:36.576
- You holding?
- No.

24:36.578 --> 24:38.478
Come on, man.

24:38.480 --> 24:40.546
Hey.

24:40.548 --> 24:43.049
I'll pay a lot for whatever you got.

24:55.262 --> 24:56.896
Just missed him.

24:56.898 --> 24:58.297
What?

24:58.299 --> 24:59.899
There was a change of plans, per Mrs.
Hawthorne.

24:59.901 --> 25:01.634
Yeah. Uh, I'm her son-in-law.

25:01.636 --> 25:03.269
She sent me down here to make sure

25:03.271 --> 25:05.304
everything was taken care of.

25:05.306 --> 25:07.774
- So you've sent Mr. Hawthorne to...?
- Shore Road Crematory.

25:07.776 --> 25:08.941
Right.

25:08.943 --> 25:12.245
Good.

25:12.247 --> 25:13.846
That's good. Good.

25:13.848 --> 25:15.681
That's what she wanted, so...
that's great.

25:15.683 --> 25:17.116
Would you excuse me?

25:47.949 --> 25:49.982
You got to be kidding me.

25:53.454 --> 25:54.954
License and registration, please.

25:54.956 --> 25:59.125
I don't have my registration on me.

25:59.127 --> 26:01.327
Your tags expired.

26:01.329 --> 26:04.564
About 12 years ago.

26:04.566 --> 26:06.599
Your ID, too.

26:06.601 --> 26:09.735
All right, step out of
the car, please, sir.

26:16.910 --> 26:19.645
I thought there was a visitation.

26:19.647 --> 26:20.813
There's no casket.

26:20.815 --> 26:22.949
I decided to go ahead
with the cremation.

26:22.951 --> 26:25.551
I just couldn't stand to
see him that way anymore.

26:25.553 --> 26:27.220
Not after the hospital.

26:27.222 --> 26:28.988
I'm sorry.

26:28.990 --> 26:31.924
I-I should've been there with you.

26:33.227 --> 26:34.594
What's cremation?

26:34.596 --> 26:36.662
Um...

26:40.500 --> 26:42.802
Grandpa's not in his body anymore.

26:42.804 --> 26:46.105
It's just a shell, and sometimes people

26:46.107 --> 26:48.474
decide to burn the shell,
and then they just have

26:48.476 --> 26:51.010
their ashes to remember them by.

26:53.747 --> 26:56.349
Soph.

26:56.351 --> 26:59.285
You wait right here, buddy?

27:05.993 --> 27:08.361
Could've called me.

27:10.430 --> 27:12.832
Whatever we are,

27:12.834 --> 27:14.767
I still loved him.

27:14.769 --> 27:17.536
He's still Jack's grandpa.

27:25.312 --> 27:29.115
If you want me to leave, I will.

27:45.899 --> 27:48.167
Hawthorne, Mitchell.

27:48.169 --> 27:49.702
Just missed him.

27:49.704 --> 27:50.803
What?

27:50.805 --> 27:53.372
Yeah, he went in about
three, four minutes ago.

27:53.374 --> 27:54.807
Went in...?

27:54.809 --> 27:56.976
The oven.

27:56.978 --> 27:58.878
Damn.

27:58.880 --> 28:01.314
He was dead, right?

28:13.727 --> 28:16.295
Ah, damn.

28:16.297 --> 28:18.297
Yeah.

28:18.299 --> 28:19.799
I thought you might like to
know that your brother-in-law

28:19.801 --> 28:20.766
was just brought in.

28:20.768 --> 28:21.934
What?

28:21.936 --> 28:24.470
Yup. Garrett.

28:24.472 --> 28:26.605
He was driving around
with an expired license,

28:26.607 --> 28:28.374
no registration, no insurance.

28:28.376 --> 28:29.942
Will you transfer me to the lieutenant?

28:29.944 --> 28:31.010
They need to let him go.

28:31.012 --> 28:32.244
Whoa, whoa.

28:32.246 --> 28:33.913
Three different violations and...

28:33.915 --> 28:35.982
Cutter, the guy's about to miss
his father's funeral, okay?

28:35.984 --> 28:38.250
We can deal with his
minor infractions later.

28:38.252 --> 28:40.052
Just transfer me.

28:46.860 --> 28:49.996
I'm glad you could make it. Thank you.

28:52.332 --> 28:54.567
- Have you seen Brady?
- No.

28:54.569 --> 28:56.502
At our last bridge game,

28:56.504 --> 28:59.605
Mitchell was the life of the party.

28:59.607 --> 29:01.273
Just doesn't seem real, Madeline.

29:01.275 --> 29:02.842
- I know.
- Yeah.

29:02.844 --> 29:04.677
- I'm so glad you're here.
- Thank you.

29:04.679 --> 29:06.812
Thank you.

29:06.814 --> 29:08.180
Mom, can I have a minute?

29:08.182 --> 29:10.383
Of course.

29:15.055 --> 29:17.490
What's going on?

29:17.492 --> 29:19.492
Excuse me?

29:19.494 --> 29:21.827
Dad was still playing bridge

29:21.829 --> 29:25.097
and beating Gunther at chess at night?

29:25.099 --> 29:26.732
I'm not following you.

29:26.734 --> 29:29.835
It just doesn't track
with what you told us.

29:29.837 --> 29:32.038
Dementia, sundowning...

29:32.040 --> 29:35.608
You think... I'm lying?

29:39.012 --> 29:40.579
You have no idea

29:40.581 --> 29:44.150
what I've been through,
keeping up appearances.

29:44.152 --> 29:47.353
Your father's last bridge
game was eight months ago,

29:47.355 --> 29:50.756
and a gerbil could
beat Gunther at chess.

29:52.392 --> 29:54.994
So now you come to me

29:54.996 --> 29:58.998
and accuse me of lying about
his condition at his funeral?

29:59.000 --> 30:01.734
Mom, why didn't you tell us?

30:01.736 --> 30:03.769
- No.
- We could've helped.

30:03.771 --> 30:09.041
He begged me to keep his secret
because he was so humiliated.

30:09.043 --> 30:14.013
He would forget my name, where he was.

30:14.015 --> 30:18.117
It was gut-wrenching and heartbreaking.

30:18.119 --> 30:21.287
And he did a heroic job of sparing you

30:21.289 --> 30:23.422
from all of it.

30:25.192 --> 30:27.159
There were nights,

30:27.161 --> 30:29.795
towards the end, in his lucid moments,

30:29.797 --> 30:33.399
when he told me he wanted to die.

30:33.401 --> 30:37.770
And he asked for my help.

30:37.772 --> 30:40.940
I had no idea.

30:52.320 --> 30:54.286
Thank you. Please take a seat.
Is she okay?

30:54.288 --> 30:57.490
Oh, it's just all hitting her now.

30:58.960 --> 31:00.192
We should start soon.

31:00.194 --> 31:01.794
Yeah, okay.

31:09.236 --> 31:11.871
You look surprised to see me.

31:11.873 --> 31:14.807
No, I just...

31:14.809 --> 31:16.342
I'm glad you could make it.

31:16.344 --> 31:18.444
Oh.

31:18.446 --> 31:20.613
You look great.

31:27.846 --> 31:29.480
Nice try.

31:43.835 --> 31:45.969
Hey.

31:47.805 --> 31:49.773
All right?

31:49.775 --> 31:51.975
Yeah.

31:54.245 --> 31:56.413
All right, come on.

31:58.282 --> 32:00.350
I'm just struggling.

32:01.652 --> 32:03.653
I know. It's okay.

32:03.655 --> 32:04.921
It's normal.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.089
Well, yeah.

32:06.091 --> 32:08.258
Except...

32:08.260 --> 32:11.695
I've taken meds for years for anxiety,

32:11.697 --> 32:14.764
and the last few months, I stopped.

32:14.766 --> 32:18.935
I had to because Brady and I
are trying to get pregnant.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.304
And without the meds,

32:21.306 --> 32:24.674
I just feel shaky, you know?

32:24.676 --> 32:28.745
And I just had this
awful fight with Mom...

32:28.747 --> 32:30.280
about Dad,

32:30.282 --> 32:32.082
who's gone.

32:32.084 --> 32:33.717
I don't know.

32:33.719 --> 32:37.120
I really can't take anything
else right now, I...

32:37.122 --> 32:39.356
Listen to me.

32:39.358 --> 32:41.124
You're gonna be fine.

32:41.126 --> 32:43.860
Okay?

32:43.862 --> 32:45.295
You hear me?

32:45.297 --> 32:46.696
I promise you.

32:46.698 --> 32:48.865
All right?

32:52.837 --> 32:54.771
Do you remember when I was five

32:54.773 --> 32:57.841
and I started having nightmares?

32:57.843 --> 32:59.676
Yeah.

32:59.678 --> 33:02.178
You were the only one
that could calm me down.

33:02.180 --> 33:06.049
Not Mom. Not Dad.

33:06.051 --> 33:09.085
Just you.

33:25.035 --> 33:27.437
I thought you took care of that.

33:27.439 --> 33:29.172
I thought so, too.

33:50.261 --> 33:52.328
I hated my father.

33:55.267 --> 33:58.535
He's the reason I left my
family behind 14 years ago.

33:58.537 --> 34:01.538
When I left,

34:01.540 --> 34:05.108
he told me that my anger
would fade one day,

34:05.110 --> 34:07.477
and I'd come home,

34:07.479 --> 34:10.746
and we could just pick
up where we left off.

34:19.556 --> 34:21.190
He lied to me.

34:21.193 --> 34:22.725
Time ran out.

34:28.364 --> 34:30.800
Excuse me, I'm so sorry.

34:30.802 --> 34:32.202
Hey, I'm so sorry.

34:32.204 --> 34:34.437
- I had a work emergency...
- Shut up.

34:47.717 --> 34:49.518
When I was a little girl,

34:49.521 --> 34:53.289
I kept a music box by my bed
to help me go to sleep.

34:53.291 --> 34:56.458
I was like every little kid...

34:56.460 --> 34:59.062
afraid of monsters.

34:59.064 --> 35:01.064
I thought they were in the closet,

35:01.066 --> 35:02.899
but as long as the doors were closed

35:02.901 --> 35:06.769
and the music box was playing,
they couldn't get me.

35:06.771 --> 35:08.705
Meet me in the bathroom.

35:08.707 --> 35:10.807
- Now?
- And every night,

35:10.809 --> 35:12.775
my dad would kiss me on the forehead

35:12.777 --> 35:15.278
and say good night, and I'd ask him,

35:15.280 --> 35:20.316
"Close the closet and
wind up the music box."

35:20.318 --> 35:21.718
The same thing every time.

35:21.720 --> 35:26.122
"Close the closet and
wind up the music box."

35:26.124 --> 35:29.993
Every time, he did it.

35:29.995 --> 35:32.028
He knew the drill.

35:32.030 --> 35:34.063
I knew the drill.

35:34.065 --> 35:37.200
But we both got comfort
from the ritual...

35:37.202 --> 35:39.002
What are you doing?

35:42.207 --> 35:44.340
You need to be present for this.

35:44.342 --> 35:46.175
Your dad is dead. Feel it!

35:46.177 --> 35:48.978
No. Pass. Too much.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.346
Listen to me.

35:50.348 --> 35:52.649
When I lost my dad, I got messed up.

35:52.651 --> 35:54.017
I numbed the pain.

35:54.019 --> 35:56.386
It feels like an escape.

35:56.388 --> 35:59.989
But trust me, the pain
will always find you,

35:59.991 --> 36:02.792
and the longer you put it off,
the harder it beats you up.

36:02.794 --> 36:05.128
All right, maybe you're right.

36:05.130 --> 36:08.197
But... just...

36:08.199 --> 36:10.667
I got to take the edge off.

36:16.241 --> 36:18.675
I'm grateful to be his daughter.

36:18.677 --> 36:21.077
There are other ways. That
his legacy will live on

36:21.079 --> 36:25.381
through his children
and his grandchildren.

36:25.383 --> 36:30.787
Grateful to the man who
inspired me, challenged me,

36:30.789 --> 36:34.290
protected me from the monsters.

36:55.413 --> 36:58.481
My name
is Jack Hawthorne.

36:58.483 --> 37:00.283
I want to talk about my grandpa.

37:00.285 --> 37:02.118
Oh, no.

37:02.120 --> 37:06.856
It's very sad that I'll never
get to see him alive again.

37:06.858 --> 37:09.492
It's also sad

37:09.494 --> 37:12.962
that I'll never get to
talk to him, hug him,

37:12.964 --> 37:15.365
or ask him advice.

37:15.367 --> 37:17.600
But I'm mostly sad

37:17.602 --> 37:20.536
because Grandpa was cremated,

37:20.538 --> 37:25.341
and I never got to see
his decomposing body.

37:32.550 --> 37:34.217
<i>Did you like my speech?</i>

37:34.219 --> 37:36.219
It was good, bud.

37:36.221 --> 37:37.854
Really good.

37:39.657 --> 37:42.692
I, uh... I better get going.

37:43.894 --> 37:44.927
Come here.

37:47.131 --> 37:49.132
Hey, uh, Soph.

37:49.134 --> 37:51.668
Um, thanks for earlier.
You made the right call.

37:51.670 --> 37:54.704
You'll throw away that cookie for me?

37:54.706 --> 37:57.507
Why would you throw away a cookie?

37:57.509 --> 38:00.143
Too much sugar.

38:02.346 --> 38:05.381
Everything's gonna be fine.

38:21.032 --> 38:22.498
Thank you so much.

38:27.371 --> 38:29.305
Oh, Madeline.

38:29.307 --> 38:32.141
It's so sad to see you
under the circumstances.

38:32.143 --> 38:33.543
So appreciate you coming.

38:33.545 --> 38:35.912
If there's anything
that we can do for you.

38:35.914 --> 38:38.548
Honey, I have something for you.

38:43.053 --> 38:45.021
What's this?

38:45.023 --> 38:48.057
Just a little gift for you.
For the girls, too.

38:49.626 --> 38:51.894
We can put it in their room.

39:00.672 --> 39:03.172
Thank you.

39:35.173 --> 39:37.206
Look, I'm sorry about Jack.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.875
He needs therapy.

39:38.877 --> 39:41.911
Eh, he just... loves
the science of things.

39:41.913 --> 39:44.347
It's how he processes the world.

39:44.349 --> 39:46.716
Doesn't mean he... I saw
the neighbor's cat.

39:48.919 --> 39:52.421
No one wants to think
their child is troubled,

39:52.423 --> 39:54.457
but you went to therapy
when you were younger.

39:54.459 --> 39:56.926
I was a teenager.

39:56.928 --> 39:58.795
He's only nine.

39:58.797 --> 40:00.963
And he needs help. Now.

40:12.409 --> 40:15.211
Yes, that's the one.

40:15.213 --> 40:17.446
Thank you very much, sir.

40:17.448 --> 40:20.349
They even have a coat-check guy.

40:20.351 --> 40:23.219
They thought of everything.

40:27.892 --> 40:29.759
Listen, I haven't gotten
the DNA yet, but I'm...

40:29.761 --> 40:31.427
Not why I'm calling.

40:31.429 --> 40:34.397
I talked to David
Morales' daughter today.

40:34.399 --> 40:36.599
She says the belt we found
in the tunnel wasn't his.

40:36.601 --> 40:38.301
Never wore leather.

40:38.303 --> 40:40.403
Vegan guy.

40:40.405 --> 40:42.805
All right, so then probably the
belt belongs to SBK himself.

40:42.807 --> 40:44.607
He could've even worn
it to Morales' house.

40:44.609 --> 40:47.343
Pretty snazzy belt for a
bitter blue-collar guy.

40:47.345 --> 40:50.112
It's $180 retail. So...

40:50.114 --> 40:52.615
So maybe we got the profile backward.

40:52.617 --> 40:54.817
Maybe SBK does come from money.

40:54.819 --> 40:56.786
Ding, ding, ding.

40:56.788 --> 41:00.022
You see now why we have
to avoid assumptions?

41:28.585 --> 41:30.553
Thank you.

41:30.555 --> 41:33.189
For keeping your mouth shut.

41:34.391 --> 41:37.326
I didn't do it for you.

41:37.328 --> 41:38.995
I know.

41:41.665 --> 41:43.599
Tessa's trying to have a baby,

41:43.601 --> 41:47.370
<i>Alison's weeks from the election,
and Cam's sober.</i>

41:47.372 --> 41:49.372
He's beat his demons.

41:51.341 --> 41:54.644
What's your point, Mom?

41:54.646 --> 41:57.346
I think you should leave.

42:02.152 --> 42:04.587
Why?

42:04.589 --> 42:07.590
Because you're a grenade.

42:09.459 --> 42:13.763
Well, then maybe you should
handle me carefully.
