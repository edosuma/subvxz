00:01.240 --> 00:03.276
<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill.

00:03.560 --> 00:05.949
I found this website that said
sluggish physical performance

00:06.040 --> 00:07.951
is one of the side effects
of the HCM medication.

00:08.039 --> 00:10.429
Players have collapsed
and died because of this.

00:10.520 --> 00:12.112
You need to tell Whitey about your heart.

00:12.320 --> 00:13.992
I want you
to talk some sense into your mother.

00:14.120 --> 00:15.599
Tell her to drop out of the Mayor's race.

00:15.680 --> 00:17.830
- You afraid of competition?
- Just talk to her.

00:17.920 --> 00:19.273
That is, if you can catch your breath.

00:19.960 --> 00:22.269
Here's how the Fantasy Boy Draft works.

00:22.360 --> 00:24.920
Once you draft a guy,
he is yours for the season.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.276
She picked Chris Keller and I picked you.

00:28.360 --> 00:30.112
My date's already dressed for bed.

00:30.200 --> 00:32.077
Looks like someone's horny
for a little Chris Keller.

00:32.159 --> 00:35.118
Did I mention that my designs were
a total hit with the corporate big-stuffs

00:35.200 --> 00:37.668
over at Suburban Filth?
They might pick them up for a fashion line.

00:37.760 --> 00:40.752
So, she's on a date with Chris.
It doesn't mean anything.

00:40.840 --> 00:43.035
It does. She's the one.

00:43.320 --> 00:47.074
Haley still loves you.
All you have to do is take her back.

00:47.160 --> 00:49.469
Right. Kind of like with you and Lucas.

00:49.560 --> 00:52.028
<i>You see, it's not so easy</i>
<i>getting back in the ring,</i>

00:52.120 --> 00:54.998
<i>especially with the one</i>
<i>who knocked you out in the first place.</i>

00:55.080 --> 00:59.915
All of the celebrity, and all of the applause,
couldn't fill your void in my heart.

01:50.640 --> 01:52.835
- Yay!
- Yeah!

01:58.360 --> 01:59.475
- Go Ravens!
- Yeah!

01:59.560 --> 02:00.879
Yeah! Yeah!

02:03.640 --> 02:05.710
Great time to be a kid, huh?

02:07.320 --> 02:08.514
Chris Keller?

02:08.600 --> 02:10.157
And Lucas actually saw?

02:10.240 --> 02:13.073
- Whoa, Chris Keller, Chris Keller?
- Stop saying his name.

02:13.160 --> 02:15.196
I don't understand what happened.
When Nathan and I left,

02:15.280 --> 02:17.236
- you were, like, pushing him out the door.
- I know.

02:17.320 --> 02:18.548
I know. I don't know. We were...

02:18.640 --> 02:20.551
We were drinking,
and I was feeling really lonely,

02:20.640 --> 02:22.949
and I was calling Lucas,
and he wasn't answering his phone.

02:23.040 --> 02:26.953
And then Chris came out of the bathroom,
and he was just so nice to me.

02:27.040 --> 02:29.110
And he said my clothes were inspired.

02:29.200 --> 02:30.474
Chris Keller said that?

02:30.560 --> 02:34.951
Actually, I think he may have said
my shorts made his pants feel tight.

02:35.040 --> 02:39.795
Oh God, I told you guys I was drinking,
but he said a lot of other things, and...

02:40.880 --> 02:45.032
Haley, don't look at me like that.
You know how charming he can be.

02:48.200 --> 02:49.553
He didn't...

02:51.400 --> 02:53.630
He didn't sing to you, did he?

02:57.480 --> 02:59.948
Oh, my God. You guys, I'm a groupie.

03:00.040 --> 03:02.270
Okay, have you talked to Lucas?

03:02.360 --> 03:04.510
He won't answer my calls and,

03:04.600 --> 03:08.991
I mean, I'm not gonna leave a pathetic
apology on his answering machine.

03:09.520 --> 03:11.715
I'm sorry. Sorry.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.154
Lucas is never gonna talk to me again.

03:21.960 --> 03:24.793
Chris Keller always springs for breakfast.

03:25.320 --> 03:27.072
Oh, you have company.

03:28.080 --> 03:30.514
Well, I guess we'll have to share.

03:53.640 --> 03:55.039
Why are you making me walk?

03:55.120 --> 03:58.749
You need to clear your head,
leave the scene of the crime.

03:58.840 --> 04:01.559
Besides, we have less of a chance
of Chris Keller finding us

04:01.640 --> 04:03.551
if we are moving targets.

04:04.440 --> 04:05.509
Okay, come on.

04:05.600 --> 04:08.194
I know you think I'm not trying to help,
but I am, okay? I just...

04:08.280 --> 04:10.077
I don't know what to say.

04:10.160 --> 04:13.038
I haven't exactly been Miss Sunshine
for the past 17 years.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.031
You've always been the silver-lining girl.

04:15.120 --> 04:18.396
That was before it was raining men
in my apartment.

04:18.480 --> 04:20.550
I really, really messed up, Peyton.

04:20.640 --> 04:23.108
Look, you made a mistake, okay?
We all make them.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.474
Not like this.

04:24.560 --> 04:27.757
Okay, Lucas told me
he wanted to be with me.

04:27.840 --> 04:29.034
It couldn't be easier than that.

04:29.120 --> 04:31.315
All right, honey, I don't know why
you're being so hard on yourself.

04:31.400 --> 04:34.597
Okay, it's not like you cheated on the guy.
You guys aren't even officially dating.

04:34.680 --> 04:37.558
Yeah, another brilliant idea
from yours truly.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.236
Brooke, it's done, okay?

04:42.840 --> 04:44.831
You can't change it, but you can fix it.

04:44.920 --> 04:46.592
So, just go and talk to him.

04:46.680 --> 04:48.750
He might be more understanding
than you think, you know.

04:48.840 --> 04:50.432
He's not exactly a stranger to mistakes.

04:50.520 --> 04:52.715
I can't talk to him, Peyton.

04:56.920 --> 04:58.717
But maybe you would.

04:59.680 --> 05:00.749
Me?

05:00.840 --> 05:04.037
I mean, you're good with words,
and pain, and Lucas.

05:06.480 --> 05:07.993
Please, Peyton?

05:09.520 --> 05:12.273
- Fine. I'll talk to him.
- Thank you. I love you.

05:12.360 --> 05:14.715
Yeah, yeah. No promises, okay?
And you know what,

05:14.800 --> 05:16.233
in the meantime, keep yourself busy.

05:16.320 --> 05:18.595
Don't sit around
and feel sorry for yourself, okay?

05:18.680 --> 05:19.795
Deal.

05:20.480 --> 05:24.155
I wanna go by Suburban Filth anyway.
I mean, at least I have my clothes.

05:24.240 --> 05:27.630
Bet you wish you could have
said that last night, huh?

05:28.400 --> 05:30.755
- Too soon?
- Just a little.

05:31.440 --> 05:33.396
Okay. Sorry.

05:48.440 --> 05:51.477
What, you're here to kick my ass
'cause I slept with Brooke?

05:51.560 --> 05:53.676
- You slept with Brooke?
- Why else would you be here?

05:53.760 --> 05:56.320
I came to pay for Haley's studio time.

05:56.400 --> 05:57.753
You slept with Brooke?

05:57.840 --> 06:00.752
I like to think of it as sleeping
without the sleep,

06:00.840 --> 06:03.798
but, yeah,
until <i>Lucas Interruptus</i> walked in.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.389
You gonna keep doing this evil crap
your entire life?

06:06.480 --> 06:09.597
What's so evil about it?
Two kids having fun. It's cool.

06:09.680 --> 06:12.638
No, it's not cool if other people's feelings
are involved.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.358
No, it's still pretty cool.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.317
Like when you were messing with Haley
kinda cool?

06:16.400 --> 06:18.595
No. Come on, see, that's different.
Brooke's not Haley.

06:18.680 --> 06:22.559
- Plus, you don't even like Lucas, do you?
- It's not about Lucas. It's about you.

06:22.640 --> 06:25.200
You went out of your way
to take advantage of a girl who obviously

06:25.280 --> 06:27.669
has feelings for somebody else, again.

06:27.760 --> 06:29.876
I didn't go that far out of my way.

06:29.960 --> 06:31.837
Besides, how do you think I feel?

06:31.920 --> 06:34.309
I broke my cardinal rule
about sleeping with cheerleaders.

06:34.400 --> 06:37.437
I don't, unless there's at least
three of them.

06:39.400 --> 06:42.790
I'm kidding. And don't worry
about Brooke. She's not even my type.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.393
I like singers.

06:49.080 --> 06:51.389
I like to think of that as hitting you,

06:51.480 --> 06:53.232
without the hitting.

06:59.480 --> 07:01.755
You didn't even give me my money.

07:02.360 --> 07:05.796
All right, it's morning on the Hill,
and we're talking local politics.

07:05.880 --> 07:08.269
Our guest today
is mayoral candidate Karen Roe.

07:08.360 --> 07:10.999
Hello, Karen, and thanks for being here.
Tell us about yourself.

07:11.080 --> 07:14.959
Sure. I was born and raised in Tree Hill,

07:15.320 --> 07:17.550
where I have two local businesses.

07:17.640 --> 07:20.473
I went to school at Tree Hill High, and

07:20.560 --> 07:22.994
I have a son who's about to graduate
from there, as well.

07:23.080 --> 07:24.149
Well, great.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.800
Now, tell our voters
why they should vote for you

07:26.880 --> 07:29.110
over your opponent, Dan Scott.

07:29.440 --> 07:33.911
Because this town, and the people here,
matter to me.

07:34.920 --> 07:38.196
Yeah, I find that some people
care more about being a leader

07:38.280 --> 07:40.714
than they do about the people
they're leading.

07:40.800 --> 07:44.190
And I'm a big fan of the Tree Hill Ravens.
Go, Ravens!

07:45.360 --> 07:48.397
All right, let's take some calls.
Our first caller is Keith.

07:48.480 --> 07:51.313
He is a unemployed mechanic
from Tree Hill.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.072
Keith, hello, and you're on the air.

07:53.160 --> 07:55.720
<i>Yes, I have a question for Mrs. Roe.</i>

07:56.200 --> 07:59.954
<i>I'm sorry, I meant Miss Roe.</i>
<i>That's right, you're not married.</i>

08:00.400 --> 08:01.674
What do you think about the fact that

08:01.760 --> 08:04.752
your business partner
is supporting your opponent?

08:04.840 --> 08:06.558
Yes. That is true.

08:07.440 --> 08:10.398
Ironically, my business partner
is married to my opponent,

08:10.480 --> 08:15.315
so I will have to forgive her
her misplaced vote and her lack of taste.

08:15.400 --> 08:19.916
Luckily, she has a better head for business
than she does for relationships.

08:20.200 --> 08:24.079
Speaking of relationships,
didn't you have a child out of wedlock?

08:24.160 --> 08:25.718
Right. Well,

08:25.800 --> 08:28.109
I like to think of it as a single parent

08:28.200 --> 08:30.714
who is raising her child
to be a responsible man,

08:30.800 --> 08:33.155
unlike the boy who fathered him.

08:36.440 --> 08:39.159
Well said. All right. Let's move on.

08:43.480 --> 08:44.833
What are you, eight years old?

08:44.920 --> 08:48.071
Oh, right. This coming from a woman
who cut the ass out of all my pants.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.515
Too bad the one in my life won't go away.

08:50.600 --> 08:51.669
Good one, Deb.

08:51.760 --> 08:53.591
But before you start getting
all high and mighty,

08:53.680 --> 08:55.477
or in your case, just high,

08:56.040 --> 08:57.996
maybe you should think
about the deal we made.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.877
You're supposed to be supporting me
in public.

08:59.960 --> 09:03.635
You wouldn't want me going
against our little bargain, would you?

09:03.720 --> 09:07.599
What could you possibly do to me that
you haven't already done?

09:12.360 --> 09:14.510
Who said anything about you?

09:20.720 --> 09:21.789
Hey.

09:22.320 --> 09:27.075
Just wanted to see how the star player
was doing the day before his first game.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.231
Like a rock. Attaboy.

09:29.680 --> 09:32.114
Well, Bear Creek is weak this year.

09:32.400 --> 09:35.597
A lot of scouts will be there, though.
How's the knee?

09:35.720 --> 09:37.039
Like a rock.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.710
Good. Anything else bugging you?

09:39.800 --> 09:40.994
Just you.

09:41.360 --> 09:43.874
Should have seen that one coming.

09:44.560 --> 09:45.675
Yeah.

09:52.400 --> 09:55.312
This doesn't feel like
we're getting out, Mom.

09:56.160 --> 09:58.549
It feels more like we're staying.

10:11.880 --> 10:14.872
Brooke, you got a real eye for fashion.
Your designs are gonna be a hit.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.359
That is so great.

10:16.440 --> 10:18.874
You have no idea how much I needed
good news right now.

10:18.960 --> 10:21.520
So... So, I mean, what do I do from here?

10:21.600 --> 10:24.239
Well, I think you're scheduled
for the afternoon shift tomorrow.

10:24.320 --> 10:26.356
No, I mean what's next with my clothes?

10:26.440 --> 10:28.590
When do I get paid?
How much do I get paid?

10:28.680 --> 10:30.716
And do I need to, like,
design my own label,

10:30.800 --> 10:32.313
or put together a hot fashion show or...

10:32.400 --> 10:35.472
Brooke, I thought you understood.
Since you work for the company,

10:35.560 --> 10:38.711
any designs and profits that you made
for the store belong to the store.

10:38.800 --> 10:39.869
- Huh?
- You signed a waiver

10:39.960 --> 10:41.518
when you took the job.

10:42.160 --> 10:44.355
That doesn't mean I read it.

10:44.720 --> 10:48.156
This is not fair. These are my designs.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.437
They're mine. I get squat?

10:50.520 --> 10:51.589
No.

10:51.680 --> 10:53.636
You get the satisfaction
of having designed something

10:53.720 --> 10:58.077
exclusively for Suburban Filth, and
of course, your 10% employee discount.

11:08.640 --> 11:11.234
Painting while angry? That's original.

11:11.400 --> 11:13.311
Like cutting your hair.

11:17.280 --> 11:19.157
I'm guessing you don't wanna talk
about it.

11:19.240 --> 11:20.559
Good guess.

11:20.960 --> 11:23.349
Well, for what it's worth,
Brooke feels awful.

11:23.440 --> 11:27.718
To be honest with you, Peyton,
right now, that's not worth too much.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.836
Okay. I know you're upset.

11:31.920 --> 11:33.638
No, not really.

11:34.600 --> 11:35.794
I'm more

11:36.920 --> 11:39.753
disappointed than I am upset.

11:39.840 --> 11:43.992
Luke, Brooke made a mistake, okay,
kind of like we did, and she forgave us.

11:44.080 --> 11:46.196
Yeah, well, she has a really funny way
of showing it.

11:46.280 --> 11:50.432
But you know what? She made it
perfectly clear that we are non-exclusive.

11:50.520 --> 11:54.559
I made the mistake of thinking
we were meant to be with each other.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.909
I won't make that mistake again.

12:11.320 --> 12:13.276
Hey, dude, did you hear?

12:13.360 --> 12:15.920
A bunch of the guys on the team
are gonna get tattoos after school.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.355
Since when?
I thought we were just shaving our heads.

12:18.440 --> 12:22.069
Well, yeah. Well, you're the first
to hear about it, but it was my idea.

12:22.160 --> 12:24.469
- It's pretty dope, huh?
- It's stupid.

12:24.560 --> 12:27.393
Hell, yeah, it is. It's crazy stupid.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.436
You got a question, Smith?

12:34.760 --> 12:38.150
Hey, I thought about it, and you're right.

12:38.760 --> 12:40.716
I'm gonna talk to Brooke.

12:42.640 --> 12:45.074
- Hey, Brooke...
- Okay, you know what?

12:45.160 --> 12:48.869
She has never missed a game day,
so she must be in pretty bad shape.

12:48.960 --> 12:50.996
Now she won't be allowed
to cheer in the game tonight.

12:51.080 --> 12:53.640
Nothing really to cheer about anyway.

12:54.480 --> 12:56.675
Oh! Oh! Old coach guy.

12:57.040 --> 12:58.837
Coach Durham, and...

12:59.520 --> 13:01.715
- Okay, fine, but...
- But what?

13:01.800 --> 13:03.597
Well, actually, what I was gonna say was,

13:03.680 --> 13:05.591
why don't you have Nate
cut hard to the strong side,

13:05.680 --> 13:07.477
Brandon screen away
and pressure release,

13:07.560 --> 13:08.834
and that'll free up Lucas on the wing.

13:08.920 --> 13:09.909
I said...

13:15.960 --> 13:18.428
You know, actually, that's not bad.

13:25.840 --> 13:29.116
Dude, do not leave me hanging.
Tattoos after school.

13:31.400 --> 13:32.628
What do you think?

13:32.720 --> 13:35.075
I think it's still weird that
you're a cheerleader.

13:35.160 --> 13:36.832
Purple flowers, huh?

13:37.400 --> 13:39.834
- It looks great, Haley.
- So do you.

13:40.240 --> 13:43.869
Yeah. Whitey's new rules.
Ties on game day, run till you puke.

13:43.960 --> 13:45.837
Won't that ruin the tie?

13:47.080 --> 13:49.640
All right, I'm gonna take off.
I know you have to focus on the game,

13:49.720 --> 13:51.597
but this was just mandatory.

13:51.680 --> 13:54.478
- You're gonna do great tonight.
- We'll see.

13:59.560 --> 14:00.913
Nice locker.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.353
Surprise.
Guess who decorated your locker?

14:04.480 --> 14:06.869
Let me guess, you or Tim.

14:06.960 --> 14:09.599
Well, after our so-called date,
I thought you might like it.

14:09.680 --> 14:12.877
- It's very you.
- Could be worse. Could say "dyke."

14:45.520 --> 14:47.431
Hey. You seen Brooke?

14:49.240 --> 14:51.549
Just this morning. She was late.

14:52.120 --> 14:54.270
Guess late turned into never.

14:54.640 --> 14:55.993
What, did she skip?

14:56.080 --> 14:57.559
Normally, I wouldn't think twice about it,

14:57.640 --> 15:01.474
but it's the first game day of the season.
She lives for this.

15:01.960 --> 15:04.076
Has she talked to Lucas yet?

15:04.200 --> 15:06.634
No. But we have to figure out a way
to make her.

15:06.720 --> 15:09.154
We? You want my help now?

15:09.240 --> 15:12.198
Why so surprised? You are the
resident expert on making things better

15:12.280 --> 15:14.555
after royally screwing them up.

15:15.920 --> 15:17.558
That was a joke.

15:18.920 --> 15:20.239
Any ideas?

15:24.120 --> 15:26.315
Yeah, there might be one thing.

15:26.840 --> 15:29.912
For anyone just tuning in,
mayoral candidate Dan Scott is here

15:30.000 --> 15:32.833
with his lovely wife, Deb. Good to see you.

15:32.920 --> 15:34.114
Thanks for joining us.

15:34.200 --> 15:37.909
Maybe you'd like to tell our listeners
a little about yourselves.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.152
Well, I think most people in Tree Hill
remember me from my days in basketball.

15:42.240 --> 15:46.756
Either that, or driving around in their cars,
courtesy of Dan Scott Motors.

15:46.840 --> 15:49.070
But my platform is simple, Dave.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.673
Family values.

15:51.120 --> 15:55.398
It all starts at home, with good parenting,
loving relationships.

15:55.800 --> 15:58.951
Deb, sweetie,
is there anything you would like to add?

16:06.560 --> 16:08.471
"Dan is everything to me.

16:08.560 --> 16:11.028
"I trust him with my heart.

16:11.120 --> 16:13.953
- "I trust him with my son.
- Right.

16:14.040 --> 16:18.955
"And I definitely trust him with this town.

16:21.160 --> 16:23.958
"There is no better candidate for Mayor."

16:24.040 --> 16:26.998
<i>Well, that was beautiful, Deb.</i>
<i>Think I'm gonna cry.</i>

16:27.080 --> 16:28.115
Me too.

16:28.200 --> 16:29.838
<i>Let's see if...</i>

16:34.040 --> 16:37.555
Is that Lucas Scott,
star player of the Tree Hill Ravens?

16:37.920 --> 16:41.799
Well, now, how about Lucas Scott,
star chump of the Tree Hill cheerleaders?

16:41.880 --> 16:45.156
- You wanna talk about it?
- Not much to talk about.

16:45.240 --> 16:47.071
The girl that I thought was the one for me

16:47.160 --> 16:49.037
went out of her way to prove that
she wasn't.

16:49.120 --> 16:50.519
The girl being Brooke Davis?

16:50.600 --> 16:51.953
Am I that obvious?

16:52.040 --> 16:55.919
About as obvious as a black door
on the side of my house.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.149
Sorry about that.

16:57.240 --> 16:58.673
Oh, Lucas.

16:59.760 --> 17:01.113
Look, it's her loss.

17:01.200 --> 17:04.351
There are a ton of girls out there that
would be lucky to have you.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.954
I'll make sure to tell those girls
my mom said so.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.439
I'm serious.

17:09.359 --> 17:12.352
You know, a customer once told me that
the best way to get over someone

17:12.440 --> 17:14.670
was to get under someone else.

17:16.079 --> 17:18.877
Oh, my God.
I just realized what that meant.

17:20.079 --> 17:22.275
Oh, my God.

17:22.359 --> 17:25.511
I thought it was more philosophical,
you know,

17:25.599 --> 17:26.999
get to know them. Don't get under them.

17:27.079 --> 17:28.957
- Mom.
- Scratch that.

17:35.400 --> 17:38.358
I know that you're going
through a rough time,

17:38.800 --> 17:42.918
but you have the game tonight and
basketball always makes you feel better.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.752
Well, that and cake.

17:46.520 --> 17:48.511
That was when it was fun.

17:51.200 --> 17:55.273
Don't let your heart get in the way
of the one thing you love most.

17:56.280 --> 17:57.872
Just do your best.

18:05.840 --> 18:09.469
It's gonna be okay.
Just step away from the cake.

18:09.560 --> 18:11.278
You have too much to live for.

18:11.360 --> 18:14.238
- Like what?
- We missed you at school today.

18:14.920 --> 18:16.751
Couldn't handle it.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.549
You guys, how am I gonna face Lucas

18:18.640 --> 18:20.870
if I can't even face a locker
he decorated for me?

18:20.960 --> 18:23.349
Oh, just tell him
how you really feel, Brooke.

18:23.440 --> 18:26.159
Nobody in this town
deals with their problems head on.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.390
And all he ever sees is boys on your wall
and in your bed,

18:31.160 --> 18:33.037
and that's not how you spent
your summer, Brooke.

18:34.640 --> 18:37.473
The real way you spent it
is locked away under your bed.

18:36.600 --> 18:38.318
And the letters you wrote to Lucas...

18:39.520 --> 18:41.078
You told her about my letters?

18:41.320 --> 18:43.151
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

18:42.960 --> 18:46.111
I didn't tell her. She Winona Ryder-ed
them out from under the bed.

18:44.880 --> 18:46.871
Okay, all right. Not the point.

18:48.120 --> 18:50.759
The point is, you need to stop hiding.

18:50.200 --> 18:52.270
Just talk to Lucas.

18:53.320 --> 18:58.030
Wow. Oh, you're really good
when you play against nobody.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.276
Oh, where's the fire?

19:13.400 --> 19:14.469
What do you want, huh?

19:15.440 --> 19:17.795
- How about a quick game of one-on-one?
- Yeah, I'll pass.

19:16.600 --> 19:19.592
Good answer. And that's exactly
what I want you to do tonight.

19:19.040 --> 19:21.031
Pass the ball to Nathan.

19:22.120 --> 19:25.669
Mental note: Nathan's daddy wants me
to pass it to him.

19:25.440 --> 19:27.351
- Yeah.
- How's the heart?

19:29.080 --> 19:31.275
Medication slowing you down?

19:33.360 --> 19:36.716
- Don't worry about it.
- Is that what you told Whitey?

19:35.840 --> 19:38.912
Oh, you haven't told him yet.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.273
I could see why.

19:44.080 --> 19:46.196
If he knew one of his players
could drop dead at any minute,

19:46.080 --> 19:47.308
he wouldn't let him play.

19:48.280 --> 19:50.953
Well, I can't see any reason
why he'd need to know.

19:49.600 --> 19:53.593
As long as you do what I tell you,
and pass the ball to Nathan.

19:52.360 --> 19:54.316
Oh, missed again.

20:01.640 --> 20:02.675
Hey, I'm...

20:17.600 --> 20:20.319
Chris Keller.
No need to introduce yourself, son.

20:18.720 --> 20:20.039
Come on in.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.556
Little gift for the wife.

20:25.920 --> 20:28.229
You know, it's nice to meet you.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.915
I'm practically your biggest fan.

20:35.480 --> 20:38.278
- You have good taste in music.
- Music? Uh, no.

20:38.760 --> 20:40.955
I'm a fan of how you screwed up
my son's marriage.

20:42.040 --> 20:45.874
You see, you accomplished with one kiss
what I was trying months to do.

20:44.320 --> 20:45.673
Nice work.

20:48.240 --> 20:50.674
What can I say? I'm a good kisser.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.550
You remind me a lot of myself.

20:54.800 --> 20:56.711
Maybe I know your mother.

20:57.120 --> 20:59.793
So, you took Nathan's wife.
Now what do you want?

21:00.160 --> 21:02.549
And if you say mine, be my guest.

21:02.920 --> 21:03.989
Nah.

21:05.800 --> 21:08.109
I mean, she's definitely a MILF.

21:07.480 --> 21:08.913
But for now,

21:12.000 --> 21:14.275
I just need the $500 Nathan owes me.

21:13.800 --> 21:14.949
$500?

21:16.160 --> 21:19.072
Well, since I'm my son's bank, do you
mind telling me what I'm paying for?

21:20.440 --> 21:24.353
Haley's studio time. Nathan's idea.
I'm helping her record again.

21:23.440 --> 21:25.271
Still my biggest fan?

21:28.720 --> 21:30.676
I didn't realize I was producing
her next album.

21:30.960 --> 21:34.157
Actually, I am,
but I could see how you'd want to.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.991
It's gonna be really good.

21:36.280 --> 21:39.033
Make sure you thank me in the liner notes.

21:42.400 --> 21:43.753
Hey, Chris.

21:48.800 --> 21:52.873
Before you go, maybe you wanna talk
about making some real money.

21:51.240 --> 21:54.073
Heard about what happened
Saturday night.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.511
- And?
- And if all this stuff about Brooke

22:12.520 --> 22:13.714
is gonna make you play any worse,

22:14.520 --> 22:17.239
you should just take yourself
out of the game right now.

22:15.800 --> 22:18.712
Thanks for your concern, but how about
you mind your own business?

22:18.600 --> 22:20.113
The game is my business, all right,

22:21.600 --> 22:24.194
and I don't want you screwing it up
over some chick.

22:23.200 --> 22:25.919
- You're one to talk.
- Yeah, I am.

22:25.880 --> 22:28.678
See, my game's gotten better.
Your game sucks.

22:28.680 --> 22:29.874
Fix it.

22:31.560 --> 22:33.232
Your marriage sucks.

22:33.480 --> 22:34.674
Fix it.

22:35.760 --> 22:37.398
I'll tell you what.

22:39.560 --> 22:44.076
I'll give you the same brilliant advice
you gave me when Chris kissed Haley.

22:41.640 --> 22:44.279
Just forgive her, man. She loves you.

22:46.640 --> 22:48.676
Doesn't help much, does it?

22:52.120 --> 22:54.270
<i>Good evening,</i>
<i>and welcome to the sold-out start</i>

23:00.480 --> 23:03.358
<i>of what could be the greatest season ever</i>
<i>for the Tree Hill Ravens.</i>

23:02.720 --> 23:03.994
<i>If you're a fan of Ravens basketball,</i>

23:06.440 --> 23:08.192
<i>it's gotta be killing you</i>
<i>not to be here tonight.</i>

23:07.800 --> 23:09.028
<i>We'll head to the locker room,</i>

23:09.640 --> 23:11.756
<i>where I'll try to get a word</i>
<i>with the players before the game.</i>

23:10.960 --> 23:15.112
<i>And I'm gonna hide inside the locker room</i>
<i>to get a look at them after.</i>

23:13.160 --> 23:15.594
<i>Gigi Silveri, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

23:17.400 --> 23:19.595
Well, well.

23:25.080 --> 23:27.435
Shut up.
I can't believe you were with Brooke.

23:27.760 --> 23:29.239
Are you jealous?

23:30.200 --> 23:32.839
I swear, I thought about you
the whole time, Haley.

23:31.760 --> 23:32.875
You're a jerk, Chris.

23:34.480 --> 23:37.153
Careful. That's what Brooke said
right before we hooked up.

23:35.680 --> 23:37.636
Hey, what's up, blondie?

23:38.440 --> 23:40.317
Thanks for picking me up.

23:56.280 --> 23:59.795
Hey, no problem. You needed a ride,
I got to slap Chris. Win, win.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.390
I can't believe you did that.

24:01.840 --> 24:05.037
You know, sometimes I feel like
you wanna slap me.

24:04.280 --> 24:06.430
Look, I know I've been a bitch.

24:07.560 --> 24:08.675
You haven't been that bad.

24:09.800 --> 24:13.156
Please. Brooke's been calling me
Peyton Marie Sawyer.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.036
- PMS. Yeah.
- Oh.

24:14.960 --> 24:19.238
I'm just... I'm so tired
of everyone leaving, you know?

24:18.880 --> 24:22.077
They all have really great reasons,
but it still hurts.

24:23.240 --> 24:26.038
So, I guess I've been taking out
all my anger on you 'cause

24:26.520 --> 24:28.988
you're the only one who's come back.

24:29.400 --> 24:30.833
Welcome home.

24:33.360 --> 24:34.554
Thanks.

24:35.800 --> 24:36.915
Nice.

25:29.200 --> 25:30.394
I don't get it.

25:30.760 --> 25:32.432
Three cheerleaders.

25:32.040 --> 25:33.951
God loves Chris Keller.

25:33.960 --> 25:37.111
You're Rachel, right?
You just made my to-do list.

25:37.840 --> 25:39.637
You're on mine, too, under,

25:41.080 --> 25:45.039
"Make fun of pathetic old guys
combing high schools for girls."

25:42.960 --> 25:44.313
I don't talk to losers.

25:48.200 --> 25:50.634
Oh, you made an exception
with Lucas, then.

25:49.640 --> 25:52.871
You're the Rachel he's using
to make Brooke jealous.

25:52.160 --> 25:53.832
Have fun with that.

25:55.760 --> 25:56.875
Bye.

25:57.520 --> 25:58.635
Sorry.

26:00.040 --> 26:02.190
Dude, check this out.

26:04.480 --> 26:06.630
- Nice tramp stamp, Tim.
- Huh?

26:06.920 --> 26:08.194
I don't know what's worse,

26:10.080 --> 26:11.399
the fact that you got a tattoo
above your ass,

26:11.440 --> 26:13.396
or that it's of a naked baby angel.

26:12.840 --> 26:14.273
It's a cherub.

26:14.880 --> 26:16.108
Well, what'd you get?

26:16.720 --> 26:19.280
Just a shaved head, Tim, that's it.

26:18.040 --> 26:19.951
Put your clothes back on, Smith.

26:20.760 --> 26:23.957
I was just showing Nathan that I got
my number, 55, tattooed on my back

26:22.760 --> 26:24.478
to support the team, Coach.

26:26.040 --> 26:28.156
Oh, well, that's too bad,

26:27.840 --> 26:30.035
because now you're number zero.

26:30.600 --> 26:32.556
All right, gather around.

26:37.440 --> 26:40.113
Usually, before the first game of the year,

26:43.080 --> 26:46.038
I tell my players to get out there
and do your best.

26:45.840 --> 26:47.478
I tell the seniors

26:48.880 --> 26:51.997
that this is the last year
they'll play as Ravens,

26:50.720 --> 26:52.631
so make the most of it.

26:54.400 --> 26:56.277
Well, that's all true,

26:56.560 --> 26:59.393
except this year, there's one difference.

26:58.920 --> 27:00.353
When you leave,

27:01.840 --> 27:03.592
I'll be leaving, too.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.879
At the end of this season, I'm retiring.

27:07.760 --> 27:12.117
Now, you boys have worked harder
than any team that I've ever coached.

27:13.120 --> 27:17.716
You've got the talent and the desire
to be the best team I've ever coached.

27:17.560 --> 27:19.278
I know it. You know it.

27:22.240 --> 27:24.879
Now it's time to make everybody else
know it.

27:24.040 --> 27:28.431
So I want you to go out there
and start this season like champions,

27:26.760 --> 27:30.196
because that is how I intend to end it.
Let's go.

27:31.280 --> 27:32.474
Hey.

27:39.320 --> 27:42.153
Now if you screw us,
you screw Whitey, too.

27:41.320 --> 27:43.470
<i>Starting, for your Tree Hill Ravens,</i>

28:38.760 --> 28:41.832
<i>at point guard, number zero, Tim Smith.</i>

28:41.000 --> 28:43.992
<i>At center, number 32, Jabbar Kelley.</i>

28:44.560 --> 28:47.711
<i>At power forward, number 12,</i>
<i>Brandon Roth.</i>

28:47.640 --> 28:51.553
<i>At shooting guard, co-captain,</i>
<i>number three, Lucas Scott.</i>

28:51.320 --> 28:54.278
<i>And finally, co-captain,</i>
<i>and last year's league high scorer,</i>

28:56.720 --> 29:00.474
<i>at small forward, number 23,</i>
<i>Nathan Scott.</i>

28:59.760 --> 29:02.672
<i>And now, to sing our national anthem,</i>
<i>straight off his tour,</i>

29:12.040 --> 29:14.395
<i>Tree Hill's own Chris Keller.</i>

29:15.040 --> 29:16.758
<i>Thank you, Tree Hill.</i>

29:22.440 --> 29:26.194
<i>This goes out to all your girlfriends.</i>
<i>You know who you are.</i>

29:24.840 --> 29:26.159
I hate that guy.

29:29.400 --> 29:32.551
Where the hell have you been? You know
we need to make an entrance as a couple.

29:42.600 --> 29:44.477
Oh, I'm sorry, Dan.
I was cleaning up shards of glass

29:45.840 --> 29:48.752
from the vase that fell off the door
and nearly killed me.

29:47.800 --> 29:51.236
- Well, as long as you're okay.
- I'm more than okay.

29:50.800 --> 29:53.837
According to the radio, Karen's making
quite a comeback in the polls.

29:55.040 --> 29:57.918
Apparently, a lot of people think
you come across as egotistical.

29:58.160 --> 29:59.639
Imagine that.

30:01.120 --> 30:03.111
Maybe she'll win after all.

30:02.720 --> 30:04.631
That vase must have hit you pretty hard.

30:05.440 --> 30:09.558
Now, stick out your chest and try
and look pretty. The public is waiting.

30:07.440 --> 30:09.954
Yeah, it's Tim-time up in here, baby.

30:15.600 --> 30:19.229
Hey. Quit looking at Keller.
We already know he can score.

30:40.800 --> 30:44.190
<i>Scott having a little bit of trouble.</i>
<i>He's not looking too good right now.</i>

31:45.720 --> 31:47.472
<i>Oh, he's looking good.</i>

31:49.200 --> 31:51.077
I'm open, Nathan! Ball!

32:24.400 --> 32:25.435
Ball!

32:26.560 --> 32:28.949
The best play you made all night.

32:33.200 --> 32:35.589
<i>Well, you can forget that</i>
<i>undefeated season, folks.</i>

32:40.720 --> 32:42.870
<i>The Ravens have lost their first game.</i>

32:43.200 --> 32:46.158
Well, so much for an undefeated season,
huh, ladies?

32:59.000 --> 33:00.752
Get out of here, Dad.

33:02.040 --> 33:05.794
This is not your locker room anymore.
Unless you found a job as a janitor.

33:04.280 --> 33:07.033
16 points, Nathan. Impressive.

33:08.120 --> 33:11.829
The scouts are thrilled,
especially the deaf and blind ones.

33:10.960 --> 33:12.313
What a joke.

33:15.360 --> 33:16.998
You're all a joke.

33:17.440 --> 33:20.159
And it seems my mistake
is the punch line.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.991
You're the punch line, Dad.

33:23.440 --> 33:25.351
Get out of here, Danny.

33:28.920 --> 33:30.831
Just a little father-son chat, Whitey.

33:31.200 --> 33:35.159
You get out of here right now
before they have to carry you out.

33:33.200 --> 33:34.349
"O" and one.

33:45.320 --> 33:47.151
Keep up the good work.

33:47.240 --> 33:49.470
Practice, 5:00 a.m., sharp.

33:55.440 --> 33:57.954
Now, hit the showers. You guys stink.

33:58.560 --> 33:59.709
Luke.

34:15.239 --> 34:17.913
- Hey, can I get a ride?
- Yeah, let's go.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.672
Let me be the first to say, great game.

34:40.920 --> 34:42.876
I am the first, right, because, I mean,

34:43.840 --> 34:46.513
wow, you guys really sucked.

34:45.880 --> 34:48.268
- My head wasn't in it.
- No, I know.

34:57.920 --> 35:01.037
I'm not one of those people
who likes to say, "I told you so," Lucas.

35:00.240 --> 35:02.549
- Yeah.
- Who am I kidding? I love it.

35:03.440 --> 35:04.759
I told you.

35:05.840 --> 35:09.196
- You need to move on, Lucas.
- To what, Rachel? You?

35:08.840 --> 35:11.149
To whatever makes you happy.
But do it now.

35:17.200 --> 35:20.476
Live life for the moment,
because everything else is uncertain.

35:19.600 --> 35:22.558
Take advantage
of what's right in front of you.

35:22.960 --> 35:25.394
I'm not hooking up
with you tonight, Rachel.

35:26.120 --> 35:27.758
That is not even what I'm talking about.

35:28.640 --> 35:30.471
And it's me
who's not hooking up with you.

35:30.360 --> 35:33.796
And it's also me who's not gonna be used
to make Brooke jealous anymore.

35:32.280 --> 35:34.714
I'm better than that, and I know it.

35:35.800 --> 35:38.439
And you can figure it out, too,
on your long walk home.

35:39.080 --> 35:41.640
- Look, Rachel, come on.
- Out you go.

35:41.800 --> 35:43.438
See you at school.

35:53.160 --> 35:55.390
Now, that doesn't look like the face
of someone who had

36:09.760 --> 36:11.671
a good talk with Lucas.

36:12.080 --> 36:14.389
Then it's a fitting face for me.

36:14.080 --> 36:15.513
Didn't go well?

36:16.600 --> 36:19.433
It didn't go. He left with Rachel.

36:18.360 --> 36:20.999
- I'm sorry, Brooke.
- Why am I like this, Peyton?

36:23.240 --> 36:25.913
How come I only realize what I want
when I don't have it anymore?

36:25.960 --> 36:28.190
Well, Lucas didn't realize what he had
when you two were together.

36:28.720 --> 36:31.109
People are just...
I mean, they're like that sometimes.

36:31.040 --> 36:32.598
Well, Rachel's not.

36:33.520 --> 36:35.431
She knew she wanted Lucas,
and she got him.

36:35.160 --> 36:37.151
She's probably gonna take my squad
from me, too.

36:37.160 --> 36:38.559
No. Hey,

36:39.240 --> 36:41.549
nobody can take anything from you
unless you let them.

36:40.960 --> 36:43.428
Really?
Tell that to the thieves at Suburban Filth.

36:43.360 --> 36:47.433
Yeah, about that,
let's go see your filthy friends at the mall.

36:45.920 --> 36:47.194
No way.

36:50.080 --> 36:53.436
Those are the last people I wanna talk to
right now.

36:51.440 --> 36:53.715
Not exactly what I had in mind.

36:55.800 --> 36:56.915
Hey.

37:07.840 --> 37:09.671
You did a good job tonight.

37:09.600 --> 37:11.079
What game were you watching?

37:11.520 --> 37:13.431
The game where you had
the entire team guarding you,

37:13.080 --> 37:14.513
and you still made, like, 30 points.

37:15.080 --> 37:17.514
16, Hales. The whole team only had 39.

37:16.600 --> 37:17.669
Well, it's almost half.

37:19.120 --> 37:21.236
Plus, I gave you more
'cause your shots were really hard.

37:20.280 --> 37:21.429
That should totally be a rule.

37:22.480 --> 37:25.074
- It doesn't work that way.
- Well, it should.

37:23.720 --> 37:24.948
Thank you.

37:26.400 --> 37:27.594
Did you wait out here for me?

37:29.840 --> 37:32.798
Yeah. I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

37:31.120 --> 37:32.394
Are you?

37:36.080 --> 37:39.197
I do this thing when I play like crap,
where I walk home alone

37:38.240 --> 37:40.117
and try to let go of it along the way.

37:40.280 --> 37:41.599
Okay.

37:43.480 --> 37:46.074
Call me later if you wanna talk or...

37:45.440 --> 37:46.555
Okay.

37:47.520 --> 37:48.953
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

37:51.360 --> 37:53.635
Taking my clothes back.
You can keep the naked mannequins.

38:23.280 --> 38:24.759
- That's stealing.
- Oh, really?

38:24.800 --> 38:27.917
Like kinda what you did to me? Just think
of it as me getting my 10% discount

38:27.160 --> 38:29.310
- 10 times in a row.
- Nice math.

38:28.720 --> 38:30.153
Hi, Mayor Roe.

38:31.920 --> 38:34.480
You might be the only person
who will ever call me that.

38:41.320 --> 38:43.151
I wouldn't be so sure.

38:43.520 --> 38:44.555
<i>Get out of here, Danny.</i>

38:46.160 --> 38:48.071
Not very mayoral, is it?

38:54.960 --> 38:56.678
<i>Robert Louis Stevenson wrote,</i>

38:56.080 --> 38:58.275
