01:28.130 --> 01:29.590
Hi, this is Joshua Corman.

01:31.341 --> 01:33.510
Yeah, I'm gonna need a sub for today.

03:16.113 --> 03:18.156
Hello, may I have your ID number?

03:18.240 --> 03:20.742
-Is this a person?
-Yes.

03:20.826 --> 03:23.579
Really? You don't sound, like, human.

03:24.162 --> 03:25.163
I am.

03:25.706 --> 03:28.750
Okay. Guess that sounded more human.

03:28.834 --> 03:33.755
-May I have your ID number?
-Yeah. Sorry, it's ARX875--

03:33.839 --> 03:35.382
No. That's the group number.

03:35.465 --> 03:37.342
I'm telling you the number it says
on this thing.

03:37.426 --> 03:39.344
Why would you have more than one number?

03:39.428 --> 03:40.762
I don't know.

03:40.846 --> 03:44.474
Sorry. Okay, here it is: 4438--

03:44.558 --> 03:48.645
Sorry, 438-779AH.

03:49.605 --> 03:52.065
Thank you. Who am I speaking with?

03:52.149 --> 03:54.484
I just told you my ID number.
Doesn't that tell you who I am?

03:54.568 --> 03:56.445
-I need to verify the information.
-Sorry.

03:56.528 --> 04:00.073
-Joshua Corman is my name.
-Birth date?

04:00.157 --> 04:02.743
Look, I'm actually
having chest pain right now,

04:02.826 --> 04:06.246
and my heart's beating really fast,
and I'm breathing kind of short,

04:06.330 --> 04:08.832
so I'd really love to see a doctor
as soon as I possibly can

04:08.916 --> 04:10.459
'cause I think I'm having a heart attack

04:10.542 --> 04:12.586
-and I'm not sure how much longer this…
-Mr. Corman.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.713
-…could be until it gets really serious.
-Mr. Corman!

04:14.796 --> 04:16.048
I need your birth date.

04:20.302 --> 04:22.971
-Doctor's office.
-Yes.

04:23.055 --> 04:26.183
Hello, I'd like to make an appointment
with Dr. Gorcey, please.

04:27.226 --> 04:29.478
Are you currently a patient of Dr. Gorcey?

04:29.561 --> 04:32.898
Nope. I got the name
from my medical network

04:32.981 --> 04:37.319
or… group or situation, whatever it is.

04:37.402 --> 04:41.657
Dr. Gorcey has an opening
on November 1st at 10:30.

04:41.740 --> 04:42.908
-You need to get here…
-Sorry--

04:42.991 --> 04:44.701
-…15 minutes early to fill out--
-November?

04:44.785 --> 04:46.787
Yes. That's her first available time.

04:47.412 --> 04:48.956
Like two months from now?

04:52.751 --> 04:55.629
Can she see me later today?

04:56.630 --> 04:58.507
Is this an emergency?

05:00.092 --> 05:01.385
Feels like an emergency.

05:02.094 --> 05:03.637
Can you be more specific?

05:04.471 --> 05:09.726
Yeah…
I'm feeling like just really nervous.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.103
I mean, I've felt nervous before,

05:11.186 --> 05:13.605
but I haven't felt anything like this
before at all.

05:13.689 --> 05:16.358
And I thought for a second
I was having a heart attack,

05:16.441 --> 05:18.110
which would be weird for someone my age,

05:18.193 --> 05:21.405
but it can happen 'cause I looked it up,
and it's possible, but…

05:21.488 --> 05:25.701
Yeah, I just don't know. I feel like
it should be getting better.

05:25.784 --> 05:28.620
Like, I'm waiting for it to get better,
but it's not.

05:29.413 --> 05:32.875
It's actually feeling
a little worse than it was before or…

05:33.417 --> 05:36.503
If this is an emergency,
you should hang up and dial 911.

05:36.587 --> 05:39.840
Yeah. No, I know.
I just felt like they'd be mad at me.

05:39.923 --> 05:41.884
'Cause there's…

05:41.967 --> 05:44.428
There's a lot of people
that have it a lot worse than I do.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.763
And it didn't feel right. So…

05:47.264 --> 05:50.017
If you're able to drive,
you can go to an urgent care.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.227
Yeah, but it's so much money.
I can't afford that.

05:52.311 --> 05:54.354
I don't have that.

05:54.897 --> 05:56.481
I'm not sure what to tell you.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.446
-Are you still there?
-Yep. I am.

06:05.741 --> 06:07.034
I just need help.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.830
Have you tried focusing on your breathing?

06:11.914 --> 06:13.123
For fuck's sake!

06:13.207 --> 06:15.918
-Please don't talk like that to me.
-You know what? I'm breathing fine.

06:16.001 --> 06:18.670
I can't go to work,
I can't sit still, I can't think right,

06:18.754 --> 06:21.924
but I'm fucking breathing,
so thank you so much for your help!

06:47.699 --> 06:48.700
Hey.

06:48.784 --> 06:51.537
You have anxiety sometimes, right?

06:52.037 --> 06:53.038
Yeah.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.790
You ever take anything for that?

06:55.582 --> 06:57.334
Well, I've taken everything for it.

06:57.417 --> 07:01.964
Zoloft, Celexa, Lexapro. That made me fat.

07:02.923 --> 07:08.303
Paxil, Xanax, Paxil again.
Klonopin. Ativan--

07:08.387 --> 07:11.890
Do you have any of that?

07:14.768 --> 07:16.436
You having an anxiety attack?

07:19.189 --> 07:22.276
Maybe. I don't know.
I don't really know exactly what that is.

07:22.359 --> 07:25.821
I've been trying to read about it,
but, you know, the Internet is…

07:27.614 --> 07:31.869
I know I never felt like this before.
At least, not in a really long time.

07:33.370 --> 07:34.538
What are you feeling?

07:37.207 --> 07:40.335
I guess mostly just scared.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.046
Scared of what?

07:46.550 --> 07:47.801
Stupid shit.

07:50.095 --> 07:53.765
But you can't tell that it's stupid
when you're in the middle of it, right?

07:57.269 --> 07:59.271
-You know what I think you need?
-What?

08:00.606 --> 08:01.648
Sit down.

08:04.109 --> 08:05.110
What?

08:09.531 --> 08:11.783
I just packed this
right before you got here.

08:11.867 --> 08:13.785
There's still half a bowl
of fresh greens for you.

08:13.869 --> 08:16.455
-Dude, you know I'm sober.
-You were just asking me for pills.

08:16.538 --> 08:18.332
-That's different.
-No, a drug is a drug.

08:18.415 --> 08:20.459
I was asking you for medicine.

08:20.542 --> 08:23.253
Trust me, this is medical.
Well, it's medical grade.

08:23.337 --> 08:25.047
Can I just please have the Ativan?

08:26.965 --> 08:27.966
Awesome.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.177
All right, buddy.

08:37.308 --> 08:39.227
Hey, can I ask you something?

08:39.770 --> 08:43.607
Why does it take an anxiety attack
for you to stop by and say hello?

08:43.690 --> 08:45.817
We've hardly seen each other
in the last five years.

08:45.901 --> 08:47.945
-I saw you like two weeks ago.
-Besides that.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.322
I don't know, dude.
What do you want me to say?

08:53.242 --> 08:54.576
Did Megan not like me?

08:55.410 --> 08:57.162
Of course she liked you. What do you mean?

08:57.246 --> 08:59.248
She never laughed at anything I ever said,
not once.

08:59.331 --> 09:01.542
That doesn't mean she doesn't like you.

09:05.462 --> 09:07.840
I'll give you the fucking pill
if you admit she didn't like me.

09:07.923 --> 09:09.508
Dude, she liked you.

09:09.591 --> 09:12.094
Why do you care if she liked you?
Who cares if someone likes you?

09:12.177 --> 09:13.971
That's dumb to care if someone likes you.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.557
No, it's not.
In a way, that's all that matters.

09:18.934 --> 09:21.395
-Okay. Honestly?
-Here we go.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.898
-You said that thing about her singing.
-I knew that was it.

09:24.982 --> 09:26.984
I knew it. I fucking knew it, dude.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.819
You know that was supposed to be
a compliment?

09:28.902 --> 09:30.404
-I know.
-How was I supposed to know

09:30.487 --> 09:32.948
-that she didn't like Jewel?
-Well, she didn't.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.410
So I said that one thing,
and now she just hates me forever?

09:36.493 --> 09:39.329
I mean,
I don't think she cares about it anymore.

09:39.413 --> 09:41.665
-When was the last time she brought it up?
-I have no idea.

09:41.748 --> 09:44.585
-Well, try to think.
-At least a year ago.

09:46.295 --> 09:48.589
-But you guys broke up like a year ago.
-Yeah.

09:48.672 --> 09:51.967
-So she talked about that?
-Can I just have the pill?

09:53.093 --> 09:54.344
Yeah, whatever.

09:56.346 --> 10:00.267
Shit. This is Adderall.
You don't want that.

10:02.561 --> 10:04.980
Listen, man, I gotta get ready for work,

10:05.063 --> 10:07.608
but it's really good seeing you.

10:10.485 --> 10:13.113
We should hang out again, real soon.

10:13.197 --> 10:14.531
Yeah. Definitely.

10:46.230 --> 10:48.357
Yes, this is Josh Corman.

10:48.440 --> 10:51.235
Can you verify
the last four digits of your social?

10:51.318 --> 10:52.319
No.

10:52.945 --> 10:54.696
Then I'm afraid I can't help you.

10:54.780 --> 10:57.449
Look, I don't even know
if this is some kind of scam or--

10:57.533 --> 10:59.660
If you received an email from us,

10:59.743 --> 11:03.080
then it means your VISA credit card bill
has been delinquent for some time

11:03.163 --> 11:05.457
and our services have been retained
to collect payment.

11:05.541 --> 11:07.584
Yeah, but you could be lying.

11:07.668 --> 11:09.461
-Josh, I assure you I am not lying.
-Sorry,

11:09.545 --> 11:11.672
can you not call me by my name, please?

11:11.755 --> 11:12.965
Instead of your social,

11:13.048 --> 11:16.301
you could verify your identity
with the name of your first pet.

11:18.595 --> 11:19.847
Would you like to do that?

11:19.930 --> 11:20.973
I'm thinking.

11:22.808 --> 11:24.184
Sure. Misty.

11:24.268 --> 11:28.438
-Correct. Now, Josh--
-Sorry, I asked you not to do that.

11:28.522 --> 11:30.190
I'm sorry, we have a script.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.318
Okay. Go ahead.

11:34.486 --> 11:38.615
Josh, according to our records,
you owe Global Card Visa over $3,000--

11:38.699 --> 11:41.201
Yeah, see,
I don't have a Global Card Visa.

11:41.285 --> 11:42.411
I don't have that card.

11:42.494 --> 11:45.372
Things are hard economically
for all of us, including myself.

11:45.455 --> 11:46.874
-No, you're not listening.
-Perhaps--

11:46.957 --> 11:49.209
You have the wrong person. It's not me.

11:49.293 --> 11:52.212
Josh, you're you. What about Misty?

11:55.048 --> 11:59.970
Can you tell me the last three things
that were charged on the card?

12:01.221 --> 12:02.556
Gelson's.

12:02.639 --> 12:03.724
I don't shop there.

12:03.807 --> 12:05.684
Carlito's Way Cocktails.

12:05.767 --> 12:06.894
I don't drink.

12:08.437 --> 12:09.938
Chez Jay's.

12:13.317 --> 12:15.694
-Josh?
-Yeah.

12:15.777 --> 12:17.988
-Are you familiar with Chez Jay's and--
-Yeah.

12:18.572 --> 12:21.950
-Have you been there recently?
-No, I don't go there. My dad does.

12:22.034 --> 12:23.076
I'm sorry?

12:24.995 --> 12:28.665
I think he probably opened a card
in my name or something like that.

12:28.749 --> 12:32.127
He did that once,
but it's been a long time.

12:32.211 --> 12:34.004
Josh,
do you really expect me to believe that?

12:34.087 --> 12:37.257
You know what? This is starting to
give me anxiety, so I'm gonna hang up.

12:37.341 --> 12:40.093
-Please, don't hang up, Josh.
-Have a great day. Thanks very much.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.391
"The female vampire bat

14:09.474 --> 14:11.685
is much more social
than the male vampire bat."

14:11.768 --> 14:15.731
"Female vampire bats live in groups,
unlike the male vampire bats."

14:15.814 --> 14:18.025
"They spend most of their time
grooming each other.

14:18.108 --> 14:20.068
This builds up their relationships."

14:20.152 --> 14:23.488
"The more bats you groom,
the more relationships you have,

14:23.572 --> 14:26.825
and the better your chances of survival
in the wild,

14:26.909 --> 14:29.453
where no one else cares about you.
The end."

14:32.289 --> 14:33.415
That was great, you guys.

14:33.498 --> 14:38.253
Okay, so based on what you heard,
who has a question about vampire bats?

14:38.337 --> 14:39.338
Mandy.

14:39.421 --> 14:41.590
What about the male vampire bats?

14:41.673 --> 14:42.841
They die.

14:42.925 --> 14:45.802
They don't do any grooming,
so they don't have any friends.

14:45.886 --> 14:47.971
Unlike the female vampire bats.

14:48.055 --> 14:50.891
So they're just all alone? Like floating?

14:50.974 --> 14:51.975
That's right.

15:04.029 --> 15:05.197
Hey, Ken.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.490
-Hey, Josh.
-Hey, man.

15:07.074 --> 15:09.117
-Would you wanna, I don't know--
-Sorry, what?

15:09.201 --> 15:11.286
I was just saying,
if you wanted to grab coffee--

15:11.370 --> 15:13.580
-I'm sorry, man, I have to go.
-Okay.

15:13.664 --> 15:14.998
-Okay, bye.
-See ya.

15:23.632 --> 15:25.676
-So it's like a pain?
-I don't know.

15:26.677 --> 15:28.303
You just said you were having chest pains.

15:28.387 --> 15:31.139
Yeah, yesterday, I thought
I might have been, but I don't know.

15:32.182 --> 15:34.685
Chest pains are serious, man.
You should get that shit checked--

15:34.768 --> 15:38.397
I don't know if that's really what it was.
It's hard to tell what's real.

15:40.148 --> 15:41.817
You know, you should exercise more.

15:42.901 --> 15:45.863
-That's great. Thank you.
-I'm just saying. Everybody should, right?

15:45.946 --> 15:46.947
Yeah.

15:49.992 --> 15:51.869
-Are you sweating, dude?
-It's hot in here.

15:51.952 --> 15:53.036
-No, it's not.
-Yeah, it is.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.913
-Something wrong with you.
-There's nothing wrong with me.

15:54.997 --> 15:56.665
-Actually you look sick.
-I don't look sick!

15:56.748 --> 15:58.208
-You do look sick.
-Don't exaggerate.

15:58.292 --> 16:00.252
I'm telling you--
You should go look at yourself.

16:00.335 --> 16:03.213
-Okay. Fine, I'll go look at myself.
-Yeah, go.

16:05.924 --> 16:07.467
Jesus, I look white.

16:07.551 --> 16:09.761
That's what I'm saying.
Man, you need to handle this, bro.

16:09.845 --> 16:11.430
I don't need to do anything.

16:11.513 --> 16:13.765
-This is your health. This is serious.
-It's not my health.

16:13.849 --> 16:15.601
-It's, like, my head.
-What?

16:15.684 --> 16:18.979
I'm having anxiety or panic or something.
Both. I don't know.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.023
What's the difference?

16:21.648 --> 16:22.858
Shit. Sorry.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.194
How bad is it?

16:28.405 --> 16:29.698
Bad.

16:29.781 --> 16:34.745
Okay. What do you think it is?
Hey! What's causing it?

16:35.871 --> 16:37.664
I asked you a question.
We can figure this out.

16:37.748 --> 16:39.958
-We're just talking. What's causing it?
-I don't know.

16:40.042 --> 16:41.668
Okay. So you say you were anxious.

16:41.752 --> 16:43.420
-What are you anxious about?
-I don't know!

16:43.504 --> 16:45.672
-Fuck.
-Think. What's bothering you?

16:46.924 --> 16:48.592
-Everything.
-Okay.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.637
-Can you narrow it down a bit?
-No, it's every thought that I have.

16:51.720 --> 16:54.598
I'm like, "Did I lock my car?
Should I go check?

16:54.681 --> 16:56.475
But what if I trip on my way to check?

16:56.558 --> 16:58.435
So then should I just
leave my car unlocked?"

16:58.519 --> 17:01.021
Wow.
I think we went too narrow on that one.

17:02.064 --> 17:04.066
What are the big things
that are bothering you?

17:04.148 --> 17:07.069
Big things? I don't know. The whole world
is completely fucked, right?

17:07.152 --> 17:09.195
Yeah. That's just true, man.

17:10.030 --> 17:12.074
No, really, the system's broken.
Nobody can fix it.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.785
-Even if we try, it's like trying to stop…
-Okay, this isn't helping.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.453
Yeah. No, I see that.

17:16.537 --> 17:19.164
Everybody feels the same way
about the state of the world right now.

17:19.248 --> 17:21.625
So it can't be that. Right? So what else?

17:22.376 --> 17:23.585
I don't know. Money?

17:24.336 --> 17:27.839
-Yeah. You're good though, right?
-I'm not good. Not really.

17:27.923 --> 17:28.924
-Okay, I know.
-Okay, but--

17:29.007 --> 17:30.801
There are a lot of people
that have less money…

17:30.884 --> 17:34.137
-Thank you.
-…but I'm never gonna have any real money.

17:34.221 --> 17:35.973
-Right.
-I spend everything I make every month

17:36.056 --> 17:39.852
on the rent and food and gas,
the student loan.

17:39.935 --> 17:41.812
I mean, I have health insurance,
that's good,

17:41.895 --> 17:43.397
but it doesn't cover everything.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.566
If I ever really get sick, I'm fucked.

17:45.649 --> 17:47.192
Come on, we'd GoFund you, man.

17:48.610 --> 17:51.989
No. Can you imagine me
putting myself online like that and-- No.

17:52.072 --> 17:54.366
I'd rather just go somewhere private
and end it.

17:54.449 --> 17:56.869
Hey, hey. Don't joke with that shit, man.

17:56.952 --> 17:58.370
-What?
-No, that's not fucking funny.

17:58.453 --> 18:01.290
-Come on, I didn't mean it like that.
-Please, dude. No, I know, but--

18:01.373 --> 18:04.042
You said you wanna kill yourself
because you're so fucking poor.

18:04.126 --> 18:05.669
-I didn't.
-That's what you said.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.005
Whatever you said,
we don't have money problems.

18:08.088 --> 18:12.551
Like, not really. Right? So what else?

18:13.969 --> 18:15.971
-What else?
-I don't know.

18:17.556 --> 18:18.724
I haven't had any…

18:20.184 --> 18:21.185
love.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.729
Anything, you know, in, like,
more than a year.

18:23.812 --> 18:26.648
-I think there's something wrong with me.
-There's nothing wrong with you.

18:26.732 --> 18:29.568
You're just-- We're just picky.
All right, so what else?

18:30.986 --> 18:32.154
I don't know.

18:35.157 --> 18:38.911
It just feels like I blew the whole thing.
Like I suck as a person.

18:39.578 --> 18:41.830
-That's not true, man.
-Fine, it's not true.

18:41.914 --> 18:42.956
What do you want me to say?

18:43.040 --> 18:45.334
I'm just trying to answer
your stupid fucking questions.

18:46.877 --> 18:47.878
Okay.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.758
-Have you tried googling it?
-Yes. I tried googling it.

18:52.841 --> 18:54.801
That's all I've been doing
for the last four hours.

18:54.885 --> 18:56.637
Just reading bullshit.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.347
I know it's bullshit while I'm reading it.

18:58.430 --> 19:00.724
I'm like, "Maybe if I read
one more piece of bullshit,

19:00.807 --> 19:02.184
I'll find something that helps me."

19:02.851 --> 19:05.020
How about this weighted blanket thing?

19:05.103 --> 19:06.688
I saw that. It's $250.

19:06.772 --> 19:09.233
No. Fuck that.
We can make our own version.

19:09.316 --> 19:12.444
-You can't make your own version of a--
-Of a heavy blanket?

19:12.528 --> 19:13.654
Of course I can. Watch me.

19:14.279 --> 19:15.322
No! Stay there.

19:15.405 --> 19:16.865
Stay there, I'll be right back.

19:22.037 --> 19:23.205
Get on the floor.

19:23.789 --> 19:24.915
What are you talking about?

19:24.998 --> 19:27.459
You wanna stop feeling like you're
feeling, we need to take action.

19:27.543 --> 19:29.837
-I'm gonna go lie down.
-If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.964
-Just get on the floor. Just try it.
-Jesus Christ.

19:32.047 --> 19:33.340
Can you not say that? God.

19:33.423 --> 19:34.508
-Sorry.
-Okay.

19:35.759 --> 19:37.928
-Come on, lie down.
-I'm lying down.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.221
There you go.

19:39.805 --> 19:41.640
-Are you serious?
-How did you think it was gonna work?

19:41.723 --> 19:43.392
-I don't--
-It's a blanket.

19:44.560 --> 19:46.228
-My shoulder.
-Sorry.

19:47.437 --> 19:48.522
That's better.

19:48.605 --> 19:51.859
Not for me, but I guess I don't matter.

19:59.533 --> 20:00.659
Maybe we should talk.

20:04.830 --> 20:07.249
-You feeling less anxious?
-No, I'm really not.

20:10.586 --> 20:11.587
Wait.

20:12.087 --> 20:13.755
-What are you doing?
-Wait. One sec.

20:13.839 --> 20:14.840
What?

20:14.923 --> 20:16.091
The Dodgers are on.

20:21.722 --> 20:24.224
-God, you're really sweaty.
-Yeah, 'cause it's not working at all.

20:24.308 --> 20:26.101
You haven't even given it a chance yet.

20:29.855 --> 20:31.273
-I'm getting up.
-Where are you going?

20:31.356 --> 20:33.358
-I'm getting--
-No, you are not! No, sir!

20:33.442 --> 20:35.944
-I need some time to think. Okay?
-You need to deal with this.

20:36.028 --> 20:38.447
I'm not gonna leave you alone
after all the shit you just said.

20:38.530 --> 20:40.157
Hey! Hey, hey!

20:40.240 --> 20:41.408
Listen. I'm sorry.

20:41.491 --> 20:44.661
I'm sorry, but this is how it is, okay?
So either stick with this weighted blanket

20:44.745 --> 20:47.039
or tell me what else you're gonna do
to figure this out.

21:10.270 --> 21:13.524
Hi, I'm here for the breath workshop.

21:13.607 --> 21:15.609
Down the hall, first door on the right.

21:15.692 --> 21:18.946
Okay. And
I read online it's pay what you can.

21:19.029 --> 21:20.822
-Is that right?
-Yes, it is.

21:20.906 --> 21:25.661
Cool, so is that like $5 or $20 or…

21:25.744 --> 21:26.745
Sure.

21:27.371 --> 21:29.581
I mean, are there any guidelines?

21:29.665 --> 21:31.500
Yes. Pay what you can.

21:32.292 --> 21:33.502
Right.

21:33.585 --> 21:37.297
I just don't know what the going rate is
for a breath workshop.

21:37.965 --> 21:38.966
Me neither.

21:41.802 --> 21:44.555
Okay. I mean, I wanna pay what's fair.

21:45.681 --> 21:48.976
I'd just rather not overpay.
You know what I mean?

21:52.688 --> 21:56.567
Could you maybe just tell me,
like, what do most people pay?

21:56.650 --> 21:58.485
I'm sorry. I really couldn't do that.

21:59.361 --> 22:01.864
Why not? I'm not asking you
to do something illegal or…

22:01.947 --> 22:04.241
I mean, it's breaking an ethical boundary.

22:07.661 --> 22:10.163
How about I just wait and

22:10.247 --> 22:12.291
this person coming,
I can just see what they pay.

22:12.374 --> 22:14.751
I would prefer if you didn't do that.

22:15.961 --> 22:16.962
Okay.

22:19.506 --> 22:24.636
Okay. So… here.

22:25.137 --> 22:26.763
-Do you want change?
-I don't know.

22:53.874 --> 22:54.875
Hi.

23:00.005 --> 23:01.006
Sorry.

23:25.948 --> 23:28.617
Hi, everybody. I'm Chris.

23:38.210 --> 23:41.755
Thank you all
for deciding to be here today.

23:42.339 --> 23:45.801
This group has never existed before.
It will never exist again.

23:48.136 --> 23:51.598
Now, does anyone want to share
what brought them in today?

23:51.682 --> 23:53.141
Hi, Alice. What's going on?

23:53.851 --> 23:56.478
I've been in a really dark place
this week.

23:56.562 --> 23:58.105
Your daughter-in-law?

23:58.188 --> 24:02.150
Among other things. My dog is dying.

24:03.193 --> 24:04.403
That is sad.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.656
That's what you said last week
when I told you.

24:09.283 --> 24:10.576
It's still sad.

24:12.452 --> 24:13.453
Anyone else?

24:14.830 --> 24:15.831
Hey, yeah?

24:17.374 --> 24:20.085
I have a lot of blockage around intimacy

24:20.169 --> 24:22.504
that stems from
a highly chaotic childhood.

24:22.588 --> 24:23.881
Sorry to hear that.

24:23.964 --> 24:27.551
I, too, had a highly chaotic childhood,
and I find this work really helpful.

24:35.642 --> 24:38.103
Sorry, I'm kinda distracted, I guess.

24:39.980 --> 24:43.692
I… paid $20 for this,

24:43.775 --> 24:46.320
and I'm starting to realize
I think I paid too much.

24:48.697 --> 24:51.074
The work will help
get rid of that distraction.

24:53.410 --> 24:54.578
Anyone else?

24:55.454 --> 24:58.165
I was feeling very alone today.

25:02.794 --> 25:04.004
You're not anymore.

25:07.257 --> 25:10.302
Okay, so let's get started.

25:10.385 --> 25:14.348
For the first 20 minutes or so
we're gonna breathe into our belly,

25:15.432 --> 25:16.600
into our chest,

25:17.142 --> 25:18.894
and then exhale through the mouth.

25:26.026 --> 25:29.571
So when you're ready,
find yourselves on your backs.

25:31.740 --> 25:33.659
Make yourself comfortable on your mat.

25:35.619 --> 25:36.828
Close your eyes.

25:38.664 --> 25:39.831
And we will begin.
