- What?
- What do you... What salad do you like?

02:31.485 --> 02:32.795
Elise, what are you
doing here?

02:32.797 --> 02:34.108
You didn't even...

02:34.110 --> 02:35.551
call to say
you were coming.

02:39.134 --> 02:41.467
Yeah, um, so...

02:41.469 --> 02:42.620
I'd better be off.

02:42.622 --> 02:44.991
I'm preparing things for
the Collins account tomorrow.

02:46.143 --> 02:47.517
Um...

02:47.519 --> 02:50.652
So if we meet first thing
and grab a coffee,

02:50.654 --> 02:51.964
then we can review.

02:51.966 --> 02:55.419
Yeah. You better make
mine extra strong.

02:55.421 --> 02:57.374
As if I'd forget such
a thing in the morning.

03:01.437 --> 03:02.590
So...

03:03.357 --> 03:04.414
What do you need?

03:05.855 --> 03:07.869
Well, I just thought
you said you were

03:07.871 --> 03:10.748
gonna be on time
this evening for dinner.

03:10.750 --> 03:12.702
They needed me
to stay late, so...

03:13.757 --> 03:14.811
so I'm here.

03:14.813 --> 03:16.286
Do you know what day
it is today?

03:19.454 --> 03:20.478
You lost me.

03:21.662 --> 03:22.750
Third of March.

03:27.166 --> 03:28.287
Our anniversary.

03:29.502 --> 03:32.220
Fuck, Elise.
I totally forgot.

03:32.222 --> 03:33.182
Yeah, I know.

03:35.805 --> 03:37.790
It's the work load
they put me on.

03:38.782 --> 03:40.892
I was completely
snowed under here and...

03:40.894 --> 03:43.327
Yeah, you looked really busy
when I walked in just then.

03:43.806 --> 03:44.799
Really busy.

03:49.342 --> 03:50.590
Look, I was just...

04:00.830 --> 04:01.790
Hello.

04:02.685 --> 04:03.998
No, I can't right now.

04:06.302 --> 04:07.740
Okay, okay. Yes.

04:07.742 --> 04:09.371
All right. Okay.
I'll come and meet you now.

04:09.373 --> 04:10.398
Okay, bye.

04:14.654 --> 04:16.285
I have to go.

04:16.286 --> 04:19.260
Okay? It's an emergency.
Sorry.

04:19.262 --> 04:20.827
- No, you don't...
- I have to. I have to go.

04:20.829 --> 04:22.204
- Okay?
- Please, no.

04:22.206 --> 04:23.548
That was Simon.

04:23.550 --> 04:24.987
Oh, Rick.
No, not tonight.

04:24.989 --> 04:26.011
It's our anniversary.

04:26.013 --> 04:27.772
Come on, please. Look.

04:27.774 --> 04:29.855
Stay with me tonight.

04:30.973 --> 04:33.630
Elise, I can't.
I've got to go, okay?

04:37.341 --> 04:38.939
No, you don't.

04:38.941 --> 04:41.212
Just put my...
Just put my dinner in the oven, okay?

04:41.214 --> 04:42.367
I'll have it later.

05:28.253 --> 05:29.275
<i>So let me get this right.</i>

05:29.277 --> 05:31.131
Actually, he forgot
your anniversary?

05:31.133 --> 05:33.083
Yeah.

05:33.085 --> 05:35.005
And I was stood there,
and of course...

05:36.830 --> 05:38.398
got completely rejected.

05:41.374 --> 05:44.219
God, I feel like
such a fucking idiot.

05:44.221 --> 05:45.630
You're gonna need something
stronger than that.

05:46.430 --> 05:47.518
- Right.
- Hold on.

05:50.910 --> 05:53.276
I mean, it's obvious what's
been going on, though.

05:53.278 --> 05:54.300
I've known it for months.

05:54.302 --> 05:56.252
Go on.

05:56.254 --> 05:57.948
That he's
cheating on me.

05:57.950 --> 05:59.806
What, with one
of those receptionists?

06:01.118 --> 06:03.003
Yeah.

06:03.005 --> 06:04.988
Yeah, he must be.
In fact, I know he is.

06:04.990 --> 06:07.228
I mean, all these strange
work hours of his,

06:07.230 --> 06:09.183
and having to suddenly leave
in the middle of the night.

06:10.462 --> 06:11.615
No, he's cheating on me.

06:12.958 --> 06:14.428
You know what I would do?

06:14.430 --> 06:15.516
What?

06:15.518 --> 06:18.364
Go fuck every man
in sight.

06:18.366 --> 06:20.411
What?

06:20.413 --> 06:22.939
Get him back.

06:22.941 --> 06:25.563
You know, and if he has a reason
to dump you in the future

06:25.565 --> 06:27.036
for some other girl, then...

06:27.038 --> 06:28.956
you'll have something
to throw in his face.

06:28.958 --> 06:30.780
No, no, no.
I couldn't do anything like that.

06:30.782 --> 06:32.638
I mean, I'm married.
I couldn't do that to him.

06:33.630 --> 06:35.006
Go have fun.

06:36.126 --> 06:37.500
Enjoy yourself.
You deserve it.

06:37.502 --> 06:39.259
I couldn't do
that to him.

06:39.261 --> 06:40.734
It's just wrong.

06:41.534 --> 06:42.812
You know...

06:47.070 --> 06:48.700
He's here.

06:48.702 --> 06:49.851
- Who's here?
- He's here.

06:49.853 --> 06:51.963
- Come on, you need to go.
- Wait, who's here?

06:51.965 --> 06:53.339
Raymond.

06:53.341 --> 06:54.523
Some guy I met online.

06:54.525 --> 06:56.763
No, no. Didn't you learn your
lesson after the last one?

06:56.765 --> 06:59.294
That guy...
I can't remember what he was called.

06:59.998 --> 07:01.020
Charlie?

07:01.022 --> 07:02.171
Yeah, Charlie.

07:02.173 --> 07:04.828
Oh, he was hot.
But he got weird as fuck, you know.

07:04.830 --> 07:07.291
He wouldn't stop texting
and calling me and stuff.

07:07.293 --> 07:09.211
I had to get rid of him.
Now, come on, you need to go.

07:09.213 --> 07:10.587
Okay.

07:10.589 --> 07:12.062
Just be careful
with this one.

07:13.566 --> 07:14.587
Is he cute?

07:14.589 --> 07:16.412
Hmm. He's stacked.

07:16.414 --> 07:18.236
And he's well hung.

07:18.238 --> 07:20.348
If that makes me
a bad friend, then so be it.

07:20.350 --> 07:21.723
Now, come on,
you need to go.

07:21.725 --> 07:23.643
All right. Okay.

07:23.645 --> 07:25.180
God, ever since
you left your marriage

07:25.182 --> 07:26.399
you've been having
so much fun.

07:27.133 --> 07:28.443
I have.

07:28.445 --> 07:30.875
And so should you.

07:30.877 --> 07:33.246
Now, don't be a sorry ass
and get some fresher meat.

07:34.077 --> 07:35.580
Come on, you need to go.

07:35.582 --> 07:37.500
Okay, okay. Have fun.

07:37.502 --> 07:38.651
You bet I will.

10:20.797 --> 10:23.066
I'm sorry, I just don't have
any notes in the book.

10:23.068 --> 10:25.436
It was for 3:00 p.m.
to meet with Janet Waters.

10:25.438 --> 10:27.708
Take a few images
for a plan, I suppose.

10:27.710 --> 10:28.991
Felix.

10:30.238 --> 10:32.348
Oh, Janet.
Nice to meet you.

10:32.350 --> 10:34.398
Yeah, we don't actually
need you today.

10:34.781 --> 10:36.220
Why is that?

10:36.222 --> 10:37.627
Because we don't need
a photographer.

10:37.629 --> 10:39.163
It must have slipped
my mind.

10:39.165 --> 10:41.403
But, anyway, we don't need
you, so please leave.

10:41.405 --> 10:43.199
Really nice way
to run a business, lady.

10:44.349 --> 10:45.851
Really nice.

10:45.853 --> 10:46.846
Thank you for nothing.

10:49.470 --> 10:50.590
Cheers. Thank you
very much.

10:52.734 --> 10:53.694
Great.

10:55.837 --> 10:58.395
Oh, Elise, if you're
looking for Rick,

10:58.397 --> 11:01.466
he's actually got a meeting
with a client about...

11:01.468 --> 11:04.126
He and she have had the a
date booked in for a while.

11:18.237 --> 11:19.486
Elise?

11:20.893 --> 11:22.303
Elise?

12:12.349 --> 12:14.555
Right.
I'm almost out.

12:14.557 --> 12:16.253
Do you wanna go out
for a bit of dinner?

12:20.381 --> 12:21.727
You're off out
somewhere?

12:22.910 --> 12:24.607
- No.
- It's just the outfit, then?

12:26.974 --> 12:28.509
Okay, I'll see you later.

13:08.637 --> 13:10.013
Hey, do you mind?

13:11.550 --> 13:12.734
No, go ahead.

13:20.764 --> 13:22.525
You know, you could just go
over there and talk to him.

13:24.093 --> 13:25.691
What do you mean?

13:25.693 --> 13:26.652
Whoever that guy
is over there,

13:26.654 --> 13:28.796
you're pretty enough
to just go over there.

13:28.798 --> 13:30.717
I'm sure he would not
turn you away.

13:32.253 --> 13:33.789
No, no.
It's nothing like that.

13:34.333 --> 13:35.581
What's it like?

13:39.772 --> 13:41.371
What's wrong?

13:41.373 --> 13:42.878
Man in black gone.

13:43.868 --> 13:45.214
What?

13:46.205 --> 13:47.422
Yeah, actually.

13:48.094 --> 13:49.343
Well...

13:50.365 --> 13:51.805
I'm not going anywhere.

14:01.853 --> 14:03.452
I don't know who that
guy was over there,

14:03.454 --> 14:04.859
but he clearly
doesn't deserve you.

14:04.861 --> 14:06.747
Wow. You sure do know
how to flatter a girl.

14:06.749 --> 14:08.447
I flatter the ones
I want, yeah.

14:09.406 --> 14:10.430
And the ones you don't?

14:11.325 --> 14:13.084
Why would that matter?

14:13.086 --> 14:14.938
You are not one of those.

14:14.940 --> 14:15.933
Ah.

14:18.749 --> 14:20.315
Oh, my God. It's you.

14:20.317 --> 14:21.883
The photographer
from the office.

14:21.885 --> 14:22.908
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

14:23.806 --> 14:25.499
Nice to see I've made
and impression.

14:25.501 --> 14:27.579
No, no. It's not that.
I've had a lot on.

14:27.581 --> 14:29.019
But, listen.
About Janet...

14:29.021 --> 14:30.650
Don't pay any attention
to what she said.

14:30.652 --> 14:31.706
She can be
a complete bitch.

14:31.708 --> 14:32.827
Your boss?

14:32.829 --> 14:33.915
No, no.
She's not my boss.

14:33.917 --> 14:36.188
And I don't work there
either, for the record.

14:36.190 --> 14:37.659
May I ask you
what you do?

14:37.661 --> 14:40.250
Don't tell me you're a photographer
as well and stole my job from me.

14:40.252 --> 14:41.275
No, no.

14:41.277 --> 14:42.907
- Are you?
- No, no.

14:42.909 --> 14:44.187
Good.

14:44.189 --> 14:45.819
I wanna photograph you.

14:45.821 --> 14:48.508
Not a portfolio,
just a one time thing.

14:48.510 --> 14:50.974
No, my days of posing
for the camera are long gone.

14:51.901 --> 14:53.406
Wait, you've posed before?

14:54.237 --> 14:55.228
Why don't you tell me?

14:55.230 --> 14:57.434
Yeah, I used to do some acting
when I was younger.

14:57.436 --> 14:58.780
Why did you stop?

14:58.782 --> 15:00.639
Please let me.
You'll enjoy it.

15:04.860 --> 15:05.949
Just let me.

15:17.053 --> 15:18.845
Are you sure we should
be doing the shoot inside?

15:22.109 --> 15:23.197
What?

15:26.236 --> 15:28.027
You don't like it?

15:28.029 --> 15:29.051
It's fine. I can...

15:29.053 --> 15:30.779
No, you...

15:30.781 --> 15:31.870
You look incredible.

15:34.654 --> 15:35.934
Have a seat.

15:37.629 --> 15:39.294
Anywhere you want.
Pick it.

15:40.510 --> 15:41.850
Anywhere you want.

15:41.852 --> 15:43.740
- Anywhere?
- Mm-hmm.

15:43.742 --> 15:45.151
Okay.

15:47.260 --> 15:48.413
But not there.

15:50.558 --> 15:52.061
- Is here okay?
- Mm-hmm.

15:52.894 --> 15:54.845
I have also...

15:55.836 --> 15:58.652
prepared some candles.

15:58.654 --> 15:59.868
I'm a bit nervous.

15:59.870 --> 16:01.884
Don't be.

16:01.886 --> 16:03.866
I'm just gonna take
a few test shots.

16:03.868 --> 16:05.467
I haven't done this
for a while, so...

16:05.469 --> 16:07.486
You'll be fine.
Just relax.

16:14.109 --> 16:15.549
So do you live here
with someone?

16:16.861 --> 16:18.429
Yeah, actually, um...

16:19.740 --> 16:20.763
My husband.

16:20.765 --> 16:22.107
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

16:22.109 --> 16:23.707
And where is he?

16:24.926 --> 16:26.523
Embarrassingly, um...

16:26.525 --> 16:27.674
Turn this way.

16:27.676 --> 16:29.498
He was the guy
I was spying on.

16:29.500 --> 16:30.589
Really?

16:31.646 --> 16:33.178
Yeah, I know
it's a bit weird, but...

16:33.180 --> 16:34.651
That is a little bit weird.

16:34.653 --> 16:35.740
Why would you say...

16:35.742 --> 16:38.366
No, I think it's
actually quite hot.

16:39.837 --> 16:41.371
Trust me, it's not.

16:41.373 --> 16:42.748
How do these look?

16:42.750 --> 16:44.732
I'll show you in a minute.

16:44.734 --> 16:46.043
You're so impatient.

16:46.045 --> 16:47.550
I'm curious.

16:51.613 --> 16:52.670
What?

17:01.277 --> 17:02.427
You had a little bit of...

17:02.429 --> 17:03.580
Oh.

17:03.582 --> 17:05.309
...lipstick on your...

17:06.429 --> 17:07.676
My chin?

17:10.173 --> 17:11.518
You're perfect.

17:12.604 --> 17:15.578
I'm really not.

17:15.579 --> 17:16.990
What has your husband
done to you?

17:18.877 --> 17:20.218
What do you mean?

17:20.220 --> 17:22.109
Well, to make you lose
all your confidence.

17:29.086 --> 17:30.490
Come here.

17:30.492 --> 17:31.869
- What?
- Give me your hand.

17:32.638 --> 17:33.757
Come on.

17:34.813 --> 17:35.966
Walk this way.

17:37.118 --> 17:38.971
- What?
- Come with me.

17:41.596 --> 17:42.651
Sit down.

17:42.653 --> 17:44.350
Oh, gosh.

17:46.556 --> 17:48.061
What are you doing?

17:48.509 --> 17:49.598
Get ready.

17:50.622 --> 17:51.838
Boo!

17:53.437 --> 17:56.285
That is what we call

17:56.990 --> 17:58.110
a mirror.

17:59.197 --> 18:01.020
Look at yourself.

18:01.022 --> 18:02.974
You keep your eyes
on yourself.

18:08.573 --> 18:09.790
You're beautiful.

18:12.028 --> 18:13.341
And you need
to know that.

18:15.997 --> 18:17.466
Look at yourself.

18:17.468 --> 18:19.195
Nobody looks like that.

18:21.790 --> 18:23.037
Or feels like this.

18:28.606 --> 18:29.658
Take your dress off.

18:29.660 --> 18:30.746
What?

18:30.748 --> 18:32.282
What?

18:32.284 --> 18:33.722
I don't even know
your name.

18:33.724 --> 18:35.515
Oh, how rude of me.

18:35.517 --> 18:37.342
Felix. Nice to meet you.

18:40.829 --> 18:41.918
Elise.

18:53.853 --> 18:56.125
I want your confidence
to come back.

19:02.270 --> 19:03.358
Kiss me.

19:22.557 --> 19:24.062
You're so beautiful.

19:56.990 --> 19:58.171
Wait. No.
I can't. I can't.

19:58.173 --> 19:59.260
What's wrong?

19:59.262 --> 20:00.925
I can't do this.

20:01.501 --> 20:02.523
Why?

20:02.525 --> 20:04.030
You just need to leave.

21:06.110 --> 21:07.934
Can I get any
of you guys coffee?

21:15.358 --> 21:16.669
We're fine.
Thank you, Elise.

21:17.309 --> 21:18.398
You're so sweet.

21:26.237 --> 21:29.307
Rick, I've got
to get home.

21:34.941 --> 21:36.126
Give me a kiss then.

21:37.117 --> 21:38.686
Uh, Rick, actually...

21:39.484 --> 21:40.506
before you go,

21:40.508 --> 21:42.523
I just need you to have a
look at this floor plan.

21:42.525 --> 21:43.739
I've had them drawn up
for a while,

21:43.741 --> 21:45.309
but I just need you
to approve them.

21:46.109 --> 21:47.387
What is this?

21:47.389 --> 21:49.210
Remind me.

21:49.212 --> 21:51.037
It's the floor plan
of the stairs.

21:52.284 --> 21:53.339
Remember?

21:53.341 --> 21:55.130
I was thinking we should
have it over in this corner,

21:55.132 --> 21:56.667
- like I originally planned.
- Wait, wait, wait.

21:56.669 --> 21:58.107
That would make more sense.

21:58.109 --> 22:00.763
Tessa, we can have some time
to go over this?

22:00.765 --> 22:02.010
Yeah?

22:02.012 --> 22:04.347
Give Elise some help?

22:04.349 --> 22:05.946
I'm more than capable
of doing this myself.

22:05.948 --> 22:07.611
- I can finish this.
- You don't know the first thing

22:07.613 --> 22:08.860
about this stuff, okay?

22:08.862 --> 22:10.234
- But look...
- Tessa.

22:10.236 --> 22:12.187
Next week, okay?

22:12.189 --> 22:13.373
Yeah. Yeah, that's okay.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.078
You have to go no, okay?

23:39.645 --> 23:40.702
Sure.

23:51.357 --> 23:53.211
I am going to...

23:53.213 --> 23:55.035
No.
Oh, my God.

23:55.037 --> 23:56.154
- Don't drop me.
- Are you ready?

23:56.156 --> 23:57.722
Are you ready?

23:57.724 --> 23:59.642
Don't drop me.

23:59.644 --> 24:01.627
Oh, my God. Oh.

24:01.629 --> 24:02.682
What's that?

24:02.684 --> 24:03.739
Huh?

24:03.741 --> 24:05.402
All that shit.

24:08.220 --> 24:09.406
Oh, my God.

24:22.269 --> 24:23.802
Oh, fuck. It's Rick.

24:23.804 --> 24:24.859
Yeah.

24:26.172 --> 24:27.771
You have to go.

24:27.773 --> 24:28.826
- It's fine.
- No.

24:28.828 --> 24:29.914
- If he thinks...
- I can handle him.

24:29.916 --> 24:31.643
No. No, please, just go.

24:31.645 --> 24:32.668
Are you serious?

24:32.670 --> 24:34.333
Look, I need to go and speak to Rick.
Please.

24:52.061 --> 24:53.338
Hey.

24:53.340 --> 24:55.325
I know you didn't expect
me back so soon.

24:56.285 --> 24:58.203
Listen.

24:58.205 --> 24:59.966
I know I haven't been
around that much.

25:01.213 --> 25:03.130
And I've been absent

25:03.132 --> 25:04.349
in our relationship.

25:04.989 --> 25:07.035
Yeah.

25:07.037 --> 25:08.350
But I want this to work.

25:10.589 --> 25:12.666
I want us to get back
what we had again.

25:12.668 --> 25:13.821
But why?

25:14.844 --> 25:15.997
Why haven't you been there?

25:18.492 --> 25:20.382
Work has just
completely taken over.

25:21.341 --> 25:23.354
And after what happened,

25:23.356 --> 25:26.043
I think I used it
as a big cover up.

25:26.045 --> 25:29.181
And I delved deeper into it
to avoid the realities of life.

25:31.965 --> 25:33.821
I should have been
there for you.

25:37.788 --> 25:39.581
I shoulldn't have left you
on your own to cope.

25:42.684 --> 25:43.869
I'm sorry, Elise.

25:49.500 --> 25:50.845
Anyway...

25:57.372 --> 25:58.589
See?

26:06.589 --> 26:07.805
I'm just gonna grab
a shower.

26:08.797 --> 26:10.458
- Can you do me a favor?
- Mm-hmm.

26:10.460 --> 26:12.062
Can you grab me some ties?
I've got to pack up.

26:12.636 --> 26:13.916
Yeah, of course.

26:30.844 --> 26:32.829
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?

26:34.173 --> 26:35.515
What took you so long?

26:35.517 --> 26:37.149
Felix, he's in the shower.

26:37.660 --> 26:39.386
Yeah, I know.

26:39.388 --> 26:41.085
That's exactly what
you love about it.

26:42.205 --> 26:43.674
No, we can't.

26:43.676 --> 26:44.828
Yes, we can.

27:18.269 --> 27:19.930
Yeah?

27:19.932 --> 27:21.850
Can you
grab me a towel?

27:21.852 --> 27:23.132
Yeah, sure.

28:03.741 --> 28:04.765
Elise?

28:07.932 --> 28:09.372
Can you pass me the towel?

28:31.869 --> 28:33.342
How long were
you watching?

28:35.261 --> 28:36.413
For a minute.

28:37.501 --> 28:38.525
Get in the bed.

29:39.963 --> 29:41.722
Okay.

29:41.724 --> 29:43.805
I will see you
in a few days.

29:45.788 --> 29:47.165
This trip...

29:48.156 --> 29:49.946
what is it?

29:49.948 --> 29:51.453
Some boring business.

29:53.307 --> 29:55.005
Nothing you would be
interested in.

29:55.900 --> 29:57.021
Okay.

29:59.932 --> 30:01.563
Okay.

30:01.565 --> 30:02.618
Have a good time.

30:02.620 --> 30:04.350
Okay. You too.
See you later.

30:15.165 --> 30:16.857
Perfection.

30:21.147 --> 30:22.234
- Fuck.
- What?

30:22.236 --> 30:23.994
Don't I have to go?
Your husband's gonna be home.

30:23.996 --> 30:25.980
Oh, no, no, no.
Relax, relax.

30:26.844 --> 30:28.058
Relax.

30:28.060 --> 30:31.643
Rick's actually away
on a business trip.

30:31.645 --> 30:33.274
- Is he?
- Yeah.

30:33.276 --> 30:35.131
You didn't say.

30:35.133 --> 30:36.730
Well, he's not back
until Tuesday.

30:36.732 --> 30:39.194
So I'm gonna be all alone.

30:39.196 --> 30:41.306
Hmm. Am I invited?

30:41.308 --> 30:42.491
I can come around.

30:42.493 --> 30:44.733
Oh, do you even need
an invitation anymore?

30:50.781 --> 30:52.477
You know
when we first met...

30:52.731 --> 30:53.948
Mmm?

30:55.388 --> 30:57.598
I said that I want
to fulfill your every desire.

31:03.004 --> 31:04.092
Well, I do.

31:08.187 --> 31:09.212
I do.

31:10.845 --> 31:12.158
Like what?

31:14.749 --> 31:15.772
Well...

31:17.276 --> 31:18.588
You wanna know something?

31:18.812 --> 31:20.473
Hmm.

31:20.475 --> 31:23.389
I liked seeing you
with another man.

31:25.115 --> 31:26.237
I did.

31:27.548 --> 31:29.052
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

31:32.700 --> 31:33.757
I wanna...

31:36.605 --> 31:37.726
How should I put it?

31:38.716 --> 31:40.698
Invite...

31:40.700 --> 31:42.877
other men over
to your house and...

31:44.252 --> 31:45.628
give them permission to...

31:46.717 --> 31:48.382
make love
to a married woman.

31:52.381 --> 31:53.818
Don't look at me like that.

31:53.820 --> 31:55.006
- That's what you want?
- Yeah.

31:59.517 --> 32:00.538
Do you want that?

32:00.540 --> 32:03.962
Yeah. I guess.

32:03.964 --> 32:07.325
Okay, I'll arrange it then
for when your husband's away.

32:09.212 --> 32:10.554
Wait, I don't...

32:10.556 --> 32:12.187
This weekend,
when your husband's away.

32:12.189 --> 32:13.436
I don't know.

32:21.725 --> 32:22.781
Hmm.

32:23.613 --> 32:24.925
No excuses.

32:25.980 --> 32:27.356
You said yes.

32:29.053 --> 32:30.397
Elise?

32:30.973 --> 32:32.442
- Who's that?
- Oh, fuck.

32:32.444 --> 32:33.755
Oh, it's Rick's PA.

32:33.757 --> 32:35.293
You need to leave.
Now. Go.

32:35.997 --> 32:37.053
Give me a kiss.

32:38.044 --> 32:39.322
- Just go, go, go.
- Tell me you love me.

32:39.324 --> 32:41.434
- What?
- Tell me you love me, or I won't go.

32:41.436 --> 32:42.938
Elise,
are you in there?

32:42.940 --> 32:44.153
- I won't leave.
- Okay, I love you. I love you.

32:53.052 --> 32:54.588
Tess.

32:57.595 --> 33:00.252
Please, please, please,
don't tell Rick.

33:02.588 --> 33:04.061
Tell him what, Elise?

33:05.532 --> 33:06.364
Thank you.

33:08.028 --> 33:09.978
Look, if you ever need
to talk, I'm here.

33:09.980 --> 33:11.069
Okay?

33:16.349 --> 33:17.373
Bye.

33:28.923 --> 33:31.099
So he told me
that he loved me.

33:31.101 --> 33:32.701
And then he made me
say it back.

33:33.629 --> 33:34.938
You don't, though, do you?

33:34.940 --> 33:36.698
No. No, of course not.

33:36.700 --> 33:38.170
Are you sure?

33:38.172 --> 33:39.517
Yeah, I think so.

33:41.851 --> 33:43.418
So, what's he like?

33:43.420 --> 33:45.593
Oh, he's amazing. Yeah.

33:45.595 --> 33:47.130
I mean, he's not
really your type,

33:47.132 --> 33:49.690
but he's well built.

33:49.692 --> 33:51.450
Great ass.

33:51.452 --> 33:52.858
That's important.

33:57.212 --> 34:00.570
Yeah, I was...
I was thinking about

34:00.572 --> 34:02.620
taking up my acting
career up again.

34:03.003 --> 34:04.253
Oh, yeah?

34:05.468 --> 34:06.589
Well...

34:07.580 --> 34:09.721
Be careful this time, okay?

34:09.723 --> 34:12.985
You got hurt really bad
last time.

34:12.987 --> 34:14.137
I don't want you
to get hurt again.

34:14.139 --> 34:15.324
I really care about you.

34:17.371 --> 34:18.716
Yeah, yeah.

34:19.739 --> 34:20.829
You're right. Yeah.

34:23.995 --> 34:26.650
So, um,
we're experimenting this weekend.

34:26.652 --> 34:28.763
- Oh, yeah?
- While Rick's away.

34:28.764 --> 34:30.266
Yeah? Tell me more.

34:50.940 --> 34:52.029
Oh, my God!

34:53.724 --> 34:54.748
Who are you?

34:57.499 --> 34:59.579
Get the fuck out.

34:59.581 --> 35:02.077
I said get the fuck
out of my house now!

35:05.371 --> 35:06.396
Felix.

35:10.331 --> 35:11.741
Are you ready
to explore, Elise?

35:15.068 --> 35:17.820
I wanna see you get taken by
another man in your husband's bath.

36:39.292 --> 36:40.380
Why are you
sleeping with me?

36:44.028 --> 36:45.212
It's a long story.

36:46.620 --> 36:48.697
I have time.

36:48.699 --> 36:52.921
Um, well, I moved to London
when I was 16,

36:52.923 --> 36:55.196
um, for my acting career.

37:01.532 --> 37:03.579
I was doing really,
really cool shoots

37:03.581 --> 37:04.956
all over the world
and stuff.

37:06.075 --> 37:09.913
And I met Rick
here in London

37:09.915 --> 37:11.866
at a networking event.

37:11.868 --> 37:13.945
He was a little bit
older than me.

37:13.947 --> 37:15.770
He was a banker.

37:15.772 --> 37:16.922
He had a great job,

37:16.924 --> 37:19.643
and he was so charming.

37:19.645 --> 37:22.749
Um, the age difference
didn't really matter to me.

37:24.635 --> 37:27.514
There was just
something about him

37:27.516 --> 37:29.146
that made me...

37:29.148 --> 37:30.364
I just wanted him.

37:31.100 --> 37:32.605
I felt like I needed him.

37:33.371 --> 37:35.737
We had great sex.

37:35.739 --> 37:37.466
- Hmm.
- Just like this.

37:37.468 --> 37:39.770
- Just like this?
- Just like this.

37:39.772 --> 37:42.397
And we had a great relationship
based on great sex.

37:44.220 --> 37:45.340
But, um...

37:46.459 --> 37:47.609
I don't know.

37:47.611 --> 37:50.107
After a while
I fell pregnant.

37:51.484 --> 37:52.988
And then what happened?

37:56.859 --> 37:58.812
Well, I was indifferent
about the pregnancy.

38:00.796 --> 38:03.613
But, Rick, he...
He wanted the baby.

38:04.604 --> 38:06.777
Seven months
into the pregnancy,

38:06.779 --> 38:08.124
I, um...

38:09.820 --> 38:11.196
I lost it.

38:12.508 --> 38:13.949
I lost the baby.

38:15.963 --> 38:17.466
I'm sorry.

38:17.468 --> 38:18.874
No, don't be. It's...

38:21.179 --> 38:23.516
It's stuff that happens, isn't it?
It can't be helped.

38:24.124 --> 38:25.469
And now?

38:25.915 --> 38:27.897
- Now?
- Mm-hmm.

38:27.899 --> 38:31.546
Um, now. Okay, now
I'm no longer a model.

38:31.548 --> 38:32.889
No longer have a career,

38:32.891 --> 38:34.202
no longer having fun,
no longer...

38:35.516 --> 38:37.081
No longer in love.

38:37.083 --> 38:38.140
Oh.

38:41.020 --> 38:43.418
You know that day
we met in the cafe?

38:43.420 --> 38:44.764
How could I forget?

38:46.909 --> 38:49.084
I was following him to the
woman he's been sleeping with.

38:50.619 --> 38:52.537
Yeah.

38:52.539 --> 38:54.332
I plan to confront him
that day.

38:58.300 --> 38:59.453
What stopped you?

39:01.691 --> 39:03.324
I didn't have the facts.

39:05.403 --> 39:07.067
Would you have left him?

39:07.069 --> 39:08.317
Yeah, I was
thinking about it.

39:11.868 --> 39:14.428
You deserve everything.

39:15.836 --> 39:17.562
Including this strawberry.

39:18.652 --> 39:20.634
- Open.
- Why are you so messy?

39:20.636 --> 39:21.725
Open.

39:22.811 --> 39:24.025
Bite it.

39:24.027 --> 39:25.306
I bit it.

39:25.308 --> 39:26.333
Oh, my God.

39:29.372 --> 39:30.970
Do you wanna try
something else?

39:30.972 --> 39:32.121
Huh?

39:32.123 --> 39:33.241
- What now?
- Do you wanna?

39:33.243 --> 39:34.649
- Now?
- Yeah.

39:34.651 --> 39:35.930
- What do you mean?
- Stay here.

39:35.932 --> 39:38.396
Wait. No, no, no. I don't think
I'm ready for any more. Felix.

39:50.268 --> 39:51.548
Felix?

39:54.331 --> 39:55.705
Who are you?

39:55.707 --> 39:56.861
I'm Tom.

39:57.724 --> 39:58.877
You must be Elise.

40:00.796 --> 40:02.810
So, what
do you think, Elise?

40:02.812 --> 40:05.244
Do you, uh...
Do you wanna try?

40:08.156 --> 40:09.245
Yes.

41:23.996 --> 41:25.146
Yeah, I loved it.

41:25.148 --> 41:27.129
Did you? What did
you love about it?

41:27.131 --> 41:28.412
I love all that you do.

41:33.020 --> 41:34.137
We should do it again.

41:35.803 --> 41:36.924
Fuck, it's Rick. Shit.

41:39.900 --> 41:41.050
I'm just backing out.

41:41.052 --> 41:42.461
- Leave.
- Go.

41:44.284 --> 41:45.657
Who is he?

41:45.659 --> 41:47.613
- Who?
- Don't lie to me.

41:49.275 --> 41:50.873
Hi.

41:50.875 --> 41:52.124
Cheers. Thank you.

41:52.539 --> 41:54.138
Felix.

41:54.140 --> 41:56.153
- Good to meet you.
- Rick.

41:56.155 --> 41:58.137
Good to meet you.
I'm Elise's husband.

41:58.139 --> 42:00.474
We didn't realize you'd be back so soon.
We were just...

42:00.476 --> 42:01.883
on the rooftop
taking some shots.

42:06.747 --> 42:08.124
Elise, I'm proud of you.

42:12.412 --> 42:14.105
Can I have a look, then?
The photos?

42:14.107 --> 42:15.930
Oh, what do
you think, Elise?

42:15.932 --> 42:17.372
- Oh, I don't know.
- Should we...

42:17.979 --> 42:19.228
show him?

42:20.635 --> 42:23.001
No. No, I don't know.

42:23.003 --> 42:24.892
You'll have to wait
until I'm airbrushed.

42:25.755 --> 42:27.388
How was she?
Still got it?

42:28.379 --> 42:29.564
Your wife is...

42:30.524 --> 42:31.581
fetching.

42:33.467 --> 42:37.434
You know, I've told her numerous
times to take it up again.

42:37.436 --> 42:39.549
And I'm glad that she
finally listened.

42:41.211 --> 42:43.386
Anyway, I'll be
seeing you soon,

42:43.388 --> 42:45.049
and great to meet you.

42:45.051 --> 42:46.716
- And you.
- See ya.

42:47.771 --> 42:48.797
He's nice.

43:08.187 --> 43:09.277
Oh.

43:11.612 --> 43:12.861
It's about time
you turned up.

43:13.531 --> 43:14.939
Wait, is Rick back?

43:15.804 --> 43:17.753
Calm down,
he's not here.

43:17.755 --> 43:19.514
His assistant let me in.

43:19.516 --> 43:21.209
Thank God.

43:21.211 --> 43:22.683
You scared the hell
out of me.

43:24.220 --> 43:25.212
Seriously?

43:26.587 --> 43:28.860
You do realize you missed
our lunch today, right?

43:30.235 --> 43:31.389
Oh, shit.

43:33.084 --> 43:35.164
B, I'm sorry,
I completely forgot.

43:35.708 --> 43:37.434
Sorry?

43:37.436 --> 43:38.586
Where were you, then?

43:38.588 --> 43:39.837
Assuming you weren't
with Rick.

43:41.403 --> 43:42.876
No, listen.

43:44.443 --> 43:46.137
I was with Felix.

43:46.139 --> 43:48.316
You spend every living
second with that guy.

43:49.339 --> 43:50.844
Seriously, what's going on?

43:52.475 --> 43:54.746
I thought it was a bit of fun and
you didn't like him like that.

43:54.748 --> 43:56.732
He is a bit of fun.
I'm married.

43:58.876 --> 44:00.124
Well?

44:00.827 --> 44:02.170
You're blushing.

44:02.172 --> 44:03.804
And I know you.

44:04.923 --> 44:06.780
It sounds more than just
a bit of fun to me.

44:07.772 --> 44:09.628
So when's Rick
actually gonna be home?

44:12.603 --> 44:14.938
I don't know.
He's probably out with clients

44:14.940 --> 44:17.212
or at the office, as usual.

44:18.076 --> 44:20.122
I guess I best be going then.

44:20.124 --> 44:22.554
No, wait. Don't do that.
You don't have to go.

44:22.556 --> 44:23.834
Come on, stay. I...

44:23.836 --> 44:25.821
I can get us some wine
and we can have a catch up.

44:26.172 --> 44:27.418
Come on.

44:27.420 --> 44:30.265
Look, Elise.

44:30.267 --> 44:33.212
I know what it's like to be crushing
on someone, okay? It's just...

44:34.107 --> 44:35.643
You're my best friend, and...

44:36.987 --> 44:38.397
you've just
disappeared on me.

44:42.171 --> 44:43.324
Just...

44:44.411 --> 44:47.485
Give me a call when you
actually want to meet me, okay?

44:49.563 --> 44:50.588
I've got to go.

45:14.779 --> 45:15.836
I love you.

45:54.716 --> 45:55.737
Boo!

45:55.739 --> 45:57.020
Oh, my God! Felix!

45:58.299 --> 45:59.866
How did you get in here?

45:59.868 --> 46:01.657
The door was open.

46:01.659 --> 46:02.940
Why, what's the matter?

46:04.027 --> 46:05.276
I've missed you.

46:05.980 --> 46:08.348
Felix, stop, stop, stop.

46:10.683 --> 46:11.932
What?

46:14.652 --> 46:17.401
Look, should we go out
for a drink or something?

46:17.403 --> 46:18.713
No.

46:18.715 --> 46:19.995
I have something
better planned.

46:20.890 --> 46:23.130
- No, no, no.
- Come...

46:23.132 --> 46:24.153
with me.

46:24.155 --> 46:26.012
- No, no, no.
- Come on.

46:33.563 --> 46:34.524
What is this?

46:35.706 --> 46:37.244
Our next adventure.

46:38.652 --> 46:39.996
Sit down.

46:43.963 --> 46:45.305
Meet...

46:45.307 --> 46:46.586
- Mindy.
- Don't touch me.

46:46.588 --> 46:47.994
Get down there,
you little slut.

46:47.996 --> 46:49.052
Come on.

46:50.683 --> 46:51.740
Quickly.

46:52.412 --> 46:53.528
Come on.

46:53.530 --> 46:54.620
Join us.

46:56.187 --> 46:57.244
Ow.

46:59.290 --> 47:00.539
Do you like that, Elise?

47:01.274 --> 47:03.004
Do you like him in pain?

47:04.219 --> 47:05.693
You do, don't you?

47:06.843 --> 47:07.804
Do you want a go?

47:08.380 --> 47:09.596
He likes it.

47:12.604 --> 47:13.884
Here, you have a go.

47:15.931 --> 47:17.339
Come on.

47:26.364 --> 47:28.282
Good girl.

47:28.284 --> 47:29.244
A bit harder.

47:31.164 --> 47:32.828
Come on, you can do
better than that.

49:35.130 --> 49:36.156
Oy.

49:37.563 --> 49:38.523
Oy.

49:39.003 --> 49:39.964
Come here.

49:45.594 --> 49:46.684
What's the matter?

49:49.659 --> 49:51.899
I don't know if this is
something that I want anymore.

49:52.475 --> 49:53.436
Why?

49:55.707 --> 49:58.554
I don't know what I thought
this was, but...

49:58.556 --> 50:00.509
it's all gone completely
out of control and I...

50:01.723 --> 50:03.516
I was thinking I should
go back to my husband.

50:04.794 --> 50:06.268
It's because of the girl?

50:06.684 --> 50:07.800
No.

50:07.802 --> 50:09.498
I've seen four men
take you in front of me.

50:09.500 --> 50:10.681
I do it for the first time
and that's a problem?

50:10.683 --> 50:13.308
No, Felix, she's not
the problem. We are.

50:16.315 --> 50:18.236
I needed to speak
to you today, because...

50:21.114 --> 50:22.555
I had a pregnancy scare.

50:23.835 --> 50:25.114
And if it had been positive

50:25.116 --> 50:27.737
I wouldn't have known
who the father was.

50:27.739 --> 50:30.360
So I think it's just time
that this little fantasy ended

50:30.362 --> 50:31.386
before it gets out of control.

50:31.388 --> 50:32.604
You told me you love me.

50:34.139 --> 50:35.192
No, I didn't.

50:35.194 --> 50:37.147
You told me in your house.

50:41.084 --> 50:42.779
Oh, Felix, no.

50:43.834 --> 50:46.203
No, no, no.
You made me say that.

50:47.642 --> 50:49.017
You made me,
You wouldn't leave.

50:49.019 --> 50:50.971
We would have been caught.
What was I supposed to do?

50:53.659 --> 50:55.672
Felix, look,
I'm married, okay?

50:55.674 --> 50:57.243
You knew this about me.

50:59.547 --> 51:00.954
I can't give you
what you want

51:00.956 --> 51:02.488
and it's not fair
to continue this

51:02.490 --> 51:03.865
any longer on anyone.

51:03.867 --> 51:05.273
- No, I know what you want.
- No.

51:05.275 --> 51:07.258
I know what you want.
I know.

51:07.260 --> 51:08.953
You felt threatened
because of the girl.

51:08.955 --> 51:10.842
That's all it was.
I can give you what you want.

51:10.844 --> 51:12.120
You know I can.
I love you so much.

51:12.122 --> 51:13.595
No, please stop.

51:14.874 --> 51:16.088
No, listen to me.

51:16.090 --> 51:17.529
I can give you
what you desire.

51:17.531 --> 51:19.386
Oh, Felix, don't.

51:20.571 --> 51:22.232
Now get in here!

51:22.234 --> 51:23.641
Felix, no!

51:25.531 --> 51:26.874
Felix, no!

51:26.876 --> 51:27.900
Shut up.

51:28.507 --> 51:30.008
What the hell is going on?

51:30.010 --> 51:31.225
Get the fuck off.

51:31.227 --> 51:32.313
Are you all right?

51:32.315 --> 51:34.713
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

51:34.715 --> 51:36.124
Seriously,
what is wrong with you?

51:40.604 --> 51:42.265
Get the fuck out.

51:42.267 --> 51:43.577
You heard her. Get out.

51:43.579 --> 51:45.436
If you don't leave in the next
minute, I'm calling the police.

51:47.355 --> 51:48.444
I'm going.

51:53.018 --> 51:55.100
You need to keep away
from that kind, all right?

51:56.315 --> 51:58.108
He's not fucking
worth it, is he?

52:02.396 --> 52:03.865
- Thank you.
- It's all right.

52:03.867 --> 52:04.828
Go home.

52:15.099 --> 52:17.307
Elise, did that guy
hurt you?

52:21.658 --> 52:23.065
Leave it, Tess.

52:23.067 --> 52:24.953
Elise, you need
to end it with him.

52:24.955 --> 52:26.873
Good guys don't do
stuff like that.

52:26.875 --> 52:28.409
I have ended it with him.

52:28.411 --> 52:29.307
Good.

52:31.323 --> 52:33.400
Let's just say he didn't
take it very well.

52:33.402 --> 52:35.067
You gotta be careful.

52:35.675 --> 52:37.211
Yeah, I know.

52:39.131 --> 52:40.220
But don't worry.

52:41.019 --> 52:42.040
I'm fine.

52:42.042 --> 52:43.066
Good.

52:43.068 --> 52:45.594
Yeah. Let's just...

52:45.596 --> 52:47.452
hope I don't see him
ever again.

52:47.931 --> 52:49.209
Yeah, hopefully.

52:49.211 --> 52:50.460
Mmm.

52:52.316 --> 52:53.497
Ready?

52:53.499 --> 52:55.195
Yeah, I think so.

52:56.186 --> 52:58.363
You look like
a million dollars.

52:59.740 --> 53:00.985
Thank you.

53:00.987 --> 53:02.587
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

53:24.347 --> 53:25.625
Wait.

53:25.627 --> 53:26.937
Why is Felix here?

53:26.939 --> 53:28.794
Well, you wanted
someone here,

53:28.796 --> 53:30.396
so, um, I wanted you
to have someone.

53:32.090 --> 53:33.532
Bianca wasn't free, so...

53:34.074 --> 53:35.131
Take a seat.

53:41.755 --> 53:43.194
Elise.

53:43.196 --> 53:45.275
You look stunning, Elise.

53:46.298 --> 53:47.705
Hey, you okay?

53:47.707 --> 53:49.052
Thanks for inviting me.

53:50.972 --> 53:52.568
- Wow.
- Yeah, I know, right?

53:52.570 --> 53:54.905
So have you... Sorry.
John, have you met my wife, Elise?

53:54.907 --> 53:56.216
Elise, this is John.

53:56.218 --> 53:57.723
They've met before, no?

54:01.754 --> 54:02.747
Hey, Elise.

54:03.483 --> 54:04.792
Oh, hey.

54:04.794 --> 54:06.744
- How are you?
- Oh, good. How are you?

54:06.746 --> 54:07.928
- Ages ago.
- Yes.

54:07.930 --> 54:08.792
You look great.

54:08.794 --> 54:10.392
It's good to see you.
I love the dress.

54:10.394 --> 54:11.768
Thanks.

54:11.770 --> 54:13.113
And who are you?

54:13.115 --> 54:14.395
Kept him a secret,
didn't you?

54:15.354 --> 54:16.921
- Felix.
- Tara.

54:16.923 --> 54:18.876
- Great to meet you, Tara.
- Nice to meet you too.

54:20.250 --> 54:23.833
You have gorgeous eyes.

54:23.835 --> 54:26.520
Oh. You sure know
how to flatter a girl.

54:26.522 --> 54:27.801
I flatter the ones I want.

54:27.803 --> 54:29.467
Ooh, really?

54:29.980 --> 54:31.898
And those you don't?

54:31.900 --> 54:34.075
You do not wanna be
one of those.

54:35.579 --> 54:37.179
Cheers.

54:38.427 --> 54:40.313
How about that?
I mean...

54:40.315 --> 54:42.809
I think you'll
find that actually

54:42.811 --> 54:44.344
me and Greg
will never die out

54:44.346 --> 54:47.737
because we discovered that he
has this insane love and hate...

54:47.739 --> 54:50.521
and we got...

54:50.523 --> 54:54.360
You know...

54:54.362 --> 54:55.546
It was loads of fun.

55:42.714 --> 55:44.408
Elise, what's next
for you and Rick

55:44.410 --> 55:46.522
now that his contract
is terminating?

55:59.131 --> 56:00.249
Elise?

56:00.251 --> 56:01.529
Yes, sorry.

56:01.531 --> 56:03.608
I said, what's next
for you and Rick

56:03.610 --> 56:05.627
now that his contract
is terminating?

56:06.971 --> 56:08.316
What do you mean?

56:09.595 --> 56:10.745
Yeah.

56:10.747 --> 56:13.560
Actually that is what
tonight's about,

56:13.562 --> 56:17.240
and I've actually
called it quits

56:17.242 --> 56:18.652
on the old job.

56:19.706 --> 56:20.699
And...

56:21.658 --> 56:23.737
So I can focus,

56:23.739 --> 56:26.041
take something a bit
more manageable,

56:26.043 --> 56:27.516
for less hours...

56:29.658 --> 56:30.875
Less stress.

56:32.219 --> 56:34.588
So I can focus
more time at home.

56:35.258 --> 56:36.347
Oh!

56:38.298 --> 56:39.512
Sweet of you.

56:39.514 --> 56:41.019
Excuse me.
The toilet.

56:45.146 --> 56:46.267
I'll go and see
if she's okay.

56:55.547 --> 56:56.760
What's got you so tense?

56:56.762 --> 56:58.521
You have people sat
at that table out there.

56:58.523 --> 57:00.377
Felix, you did that right
in front of my husband.

57:00.379 --> 57:01.657
It was hot, though, right?
You enjoyed it.

57:01.659 --> 57:03.899
Are you not listening to
anything I've been saying to you?

57:04.826 --> 57:06.651
That was far too close.

57:07.131 --> 57:08.284
Never again.

57:09.338 --> 57:10.588
Never say never.

57:11.835 --> 57:13.624
This isn't some game,
Felix, okay?

57:13.626 --> 57:14.905
This is my life.

57:14.907 --> 57:16.600
- Your life?
- Yes, my life.

57:16.602 --> 57:18.713
Your life?
Let me tell you something.

57:18.715 --> 57:20.697
Your life is gonna get a whole
lot more interesting now.

57:20.699 --> 57:23.032
- Do you understand?
- Get off me.

57:23.034 --> 57:24.668
Don't speak to me like that.
Who do you think you are?

57:27.162 --> 57:28.920
Felix, you fucking
assaulted me.

57:28.922 --> 57:30.168
- Kiss me.
- No.

57:30.170 --> 57:32.056
Get your fucking
hands off me.

57:32.058 --> 57:34.076
Get off me!
Fucking creep!

57:39.546 --> 57:41.464
She was just...

57:41.466 --> 57:42.747
Elise.

57:44.634 --> 57:46.265
Your husband is a very
hard worker.

57:46.267 --> 57:48.089
We'll be sad
to see him go.

57:48.091 --> 57:50.905
You're a lucky girl.

57:50.907 --> 57:54.201
And the men's bathroom is at the
other side of the restaurant.

57:54.203 --> 57:55.931
I just came to see
if she was all right.

57:56.282 --> 57:57.276
Right.

58:01.914 --> 58:05.016
I don't think you realize
just how lucky you are.

58:05.018 --> 58:06.936
Now, you may think that
you have everything,

58:06.938 --> 58:10.074
but you can lose that just
as quickly as you got it.

58:13.370 --> 58:15.448
Rick is a dear friend of mine,
and I don't think he knows

58:15.450 --> 58:17.240
about these silly little games
that you're playing.

58:17.242 --> 58:19.611
But when he finds out,
there will be hell to pay.

58:21.242 --> 58:24.795
And as a loyal colleague,
I have my suspicions.

58:26.618 --> 58:27.802
You better
watch your back.

58:29.530 --> 58:30.619
Janet.

58:42.970 --> 58:44.089
Elise, you're okay?

58:44.091 --> 58:46.041
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

58:46.043 --> 58:47.000
Rick will be back
in a second.

58:47.002 --> 58:48.728
He's just seeing
some of the others off.

58:48.730 --> 58:51.129
Yeah. No, it's fine.
I'll just... I'll wait.

58:51.131 --> 58:52.857
If you ever need
anything, I'm here.

58:52.859 --> 58:53.883
Okay? I mean it.

58:54.746 --> 58:56.443
Thanks. Bye.

58:57.274 --> 58:58.427
Bye.

59:06.298 --> 59:07.931
Looks like they
got lucky after all.

59:14.010 --> 59:15.416
After you, my lady.

59:16.602 --> 59:17.659
Okay.

59:28.986 --> 59:30.107
Oh!

59:31.450 --> 59:32.795
Thank you.

59:36.059 --> 59:37.627
Is that our
best champagne?

59:37.915 --> 59:39.068
Maybe.

59:42.842 --> 59:45.114
Oh, Rick,
why the suspense?

59:45.786 --> 59:47.355
Oh!

59:52.026 --> 59:53.820
Looks like
I'm all yours now.

59:56.059 --> 59:58.232
Rick, you didn't have
to quit your job.

59:58.234 --> 01:00:00.026
Why, Elise?

01:00:00.634 --> 01:00:02.393
The job...

01:00:02.395 --> 01:00:03.771
didn't make me
happy anymore.

01:00:04.986 --> 01:00:07.419
I needed some time out
to rethink things.

01:00:09.274 --> 01:00:11.675
And I realized that if I stayed
there, you would...

01:00:13.339 --> 01:00:14.844
I would lose you.

01:00:16.058 --> 01:00:18.263
And you...

01:00:18.265 --> 01:00:20.667
are the most important
thing in my life.

01:00:27.643 --> 01:00:28.697
Cheers.

01:00:28.699 --> 01:00:29.852
Oh, what's this?

01:00:31.771 --> 01:00:32.796
I love you.

01:00:33.498 --> 01:00:34.555
I love you.

01:01:41.595 --> 01:01:42.556
I love you.

01:01:43.195 --> 01:01:44.476
I love you.

01:01:50.073 --> 01:01:51.386
Who was that?

01:01:52.026 --> 01:01:53.336
I don't know.

01:01:53.338 --> 01:01:55.035
Postman maybe?

01:01:58.331 --> 01:02:03.128
Listen, why don't you
pop on the kettle

01:02:03.130 --> 01:02:05.499
and I'll make us
some breakfast?

01:02:08.154 --> 01:02:09.657
Wow, that's a first.

01:02:09.659 --> 01:02:10.744
Mmm.

01:02:49.497 --> 01:02:50.938
Where's the fucking remote?

01:03:05.851 --> 01:03:06.907
What do you, uh...

01:03:07.771 --> 01:03:09.020
What do you want
for breakfast?

01:03:14.842 --> 01:03:15.867
Oh.

01:03:26.139 --> 01:03:27.195
Weird.

01:03:29.339 --> 01:03:30.396
Ah.

01:03:32.411 --> 01:03:34.492
That solves the mystery
of the remote.

01:03:35.802 --> 01:03:37.978
Do you know what?
I think it's Bianca.

01:03:39.355 --> 01:03:40.888
She must have taken it
by accident the other day

01:03:40.890 --> 01:03:42.840
when she was around here.

01:03:42.842 --> 01:03:44.632
Bianca was here?

01:03:44.634 --> 01:03:46.971
Yeah, yeah.
She popped around the other day.

01:03:47.738 --> 01:03:49.146
Sure.

01:03:53.178 --> 01:03:55.353
That solves that then.

01:03:55.355 --> 01:03:58.779
Where would my beautiful wife
like me to take her today?

01:04:01.658 --> 01:04:04.472
Actually, I kind of have
somewhere I need to be.

01:04:04.474 --> 01:04:05.916
Hmm? Where?

01:04:09.177 --> 01:04:12.923
I have a castings afternoon
with Leila.

01:04:15.418 --> 01:04:17.081
- Elise Styles?
- Yes.

01:04:17.083 --> 01:04:18.682
They're ready
for you now.

01:04:20.345 --> 01:04:21.724
- Thank you.
- Okay.

01:04:28.921 --> 01:04:30.521
- Hello there. James.
- Hi.

01:04:30.523 --> 01:04:31.929
- And you are?
- I'm Elise. Elise.

01:04:31.931 --> 01:04:33.240
Ah.

01:04:33.242 --> 01:04:34.331
- This is Leila.
- Hi.

01:04:36.027 --> 01:04:37.463
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

01:04:37.465 --> 01:04:38.584
Good, then.

01:04:38.586 --> 01:04:39.865
Thank you.
Good to see you.

01:04:39.867 --> 01:04:40.984
- Please.
- Have a seat.

01:04:40.986 --> 01:04:42.106
Thank you.

01:04:46.587 --> 01:04:48.856
So, thank you
for coming in today.

01:04:48.858 --> 01:04:52.760
As you're aware, Leila
is casting for her new client.

01:04:52.762 --> 01:04:55.800
It's a very hip, young,
and current brand of fragrance.

01:04:55.802 --> 01:04:57.817
So the aim of this casting
is to find a girl

01:04:57.819 --> 01:04:59.451
who best matches that brand.

01:05:02.907 --> 01:05:04.185
This is your portfolio.

01:05:04.187 --> 01:05:06.360
The agent sent it
across to us earlier today.

01:05:06.362 --> 01:05:07.673
Yeah, that's correct.

01:05:07.675 --> 01:05:09.751
So we'll see what
we've got, shall we?

01:05:09.753 --> 01:05:12.568
I actually did something
similar to this brand

01:05:12.570 --> 01:05:13.655
that you were describing.

01:05:13.657 --> 01:05:15.033
It's just in the middle
of the book

01:05:15.035 --> 01:05:16.027
for reference.

01:05:17.849 --> 01:05:20.539
Of course, some of the images
are a couple of years old.

01:05:38.969 --> 01:05:40.282
Sorry, is there
something wrong?

01:05:41.466 --> 01:05:43.703
Sorry, it's, it's...

01:05:43.705 --> 01:05:44.952
It's not what
we're after.

01:05:44.954 --> 01:05:47.130
I'm sorry,
we're not looking for that kind of model.

01:05:51.449 --> 01:05:52.731
Thank you for your time.

01:06:09.242 --> 01:06:10.427
Oh, my God.

01:06:43.066 --> 01:06:44.218
Oh, my God.

01:06:56.250 --> 01:06:57.304
You didn't reply
to my texts.

01:06:57.306 --> 01:06:59.160
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

01:06:59.162 --> 01:07:00.728
Oh, so you got
the message, then?

01:07:00.730 --> 01:07:03.479
Message? What do you
mean the fucking message?

01:07:03.481 --> 01:07:05.112
You look so hot
when you're angry.

01:07:05.114 --> 01:07:06.487
Oh, Felix!

01:07:06.489 --> 01:07:08.633
- So hot.
- Oh, get off me!

01:07:08.635 --> 01:07:10.907
I'm sick and tired
of these silly games, okay?

01:07:11.962 --> 01:07:13.498
I'm not gonna leave him.

01:07:14.714 --> 01:07:16.313
And you listen to me.
If you try and...

01:07:16.315 --> 01:07:17.912
No, you listen to me.

01:07:17.914 --> 01:07:19.671
You'll do everything that
I fucking tell you to do,

01:07:19.673 --> 01:07:20.600
otherwise I'll show
your husband

01:07:20.602 --> 01:07:22.521
everything you've done
behind his back.

01:07:22.523 --> 01:07:23.706
- All of these.
- What?

01:07:24.729 --> 01:07:26.552
Do you understand?

01:07:26.554 --> 01:07:28.282
You'll do as I say,
or I'll show him everything.

01:07:30.138 --> 01:07:31.961
Look, you don't have
the power here. I do.

01:07:31.963 --> 01:07:33.273
Do you understand? I do.

01:07:33.275 --> 01:07:34.775
You are mine.

01:07:34.777 --> 01:07:36.761
You don't have
anyone anymore.

01:07:36.763 --> 01:07:38.393
And if your husband see
what you've become,

01:07:38.395 --> 01:07:39.483
he won't want you either.

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:44.887
You allowed men
you don't know fuck you.

01:07:44.889 --> 01:07:46.327
You allowed yourself
to do things

01:07:46.329 --> 01:07:48.471
that no other
woman would allow.

01:07:48.473 --> 01:07:50.104
You have no respect
for yourself.

01:07:54.907 --> 01:07:57.016
I'm gonna show Rick
these discs.

01:07:57.018 --> 01:07:58.327
He'll see you
for what you really are.

01:07:58.329 --> 01:08:00.507
A fucking disgusting
little slut!

01:08:01.978 --> 01:08:05.304
Tomorrow, I'll tell you where
you need to be, and when.

01:08:05.306 --> 01:08:07.640
You'll do one more thing
for me and this is all over.

01:08:07.642 --> 01:08:08.634
No.

01:08:10.171 --> 01:08:11.259
Now you can leave.

01:08:12.122 --> 01:08:13.560
Go on.

01:08:13.562 --> 01:08:15.002
Get the fuck
out of here!

01:08:17.818 --> 01:08:20.312
And until then I'll get
Mindy around again.

01:08:20.314 --> 01:08:21.787
She's a better fuck
than you anyway.

01:09:01.403 --> 01:09:02.555
Stay here.

01:09:06.425 --> 01:09:07.801
Are you ready?

01:09:20.858 --> 01:09:23.002
I only wanna hear you
say one thing.

01:09:26.073 --> 01:09:27.258
One word.

01:09:28.122 --> 01:09:29.691
And that's "yes."

01:09:29.947 --> 01:09:31.099
Okay?

01:09:32.731 --> 01:09:33.947
Anything else...

01:09:34.618 --> 01:09:35.962
I'll tell Rick.

01:09:39.993 --> 01:09:40.955
Ready?

01:09:46.298 --> 01:09:47.707
Surprise.

01:09:58.585 --> 01:09:59.738
Get on the bed.

01:10:03.001 --> 01:10:07.642
Get... on... the bed.

01:10:34.075 --> 01:10:35.259
She's all yours, boys.

01:10:37.594 --> 01:10:39.035
Hello, darling.

01:11:03.962 --> 01:11:05.752
Do you like that, Elise?

01:11:05.754 --> 01:11:07.002
Are you sure
you want this?

01:11:09.114 --> 01:11:11.195
Do... you...

01:11:12.089 --> 01:11:13.816
like that?

01:11:13.818 --> 01:11:15.127
Yes.

01:11:15.129 --> 01:11:16.474
I can't hear you.

01:11:21.242 --> 01:11:22.459
She takes it good.

01:11:36.827 --> 01:11:38.107
Go harder on her.

01:11:38.810 --> 01:11:39.867
Go on.

01:11:52.953 --> 01:11:54.715
I'll fucking show you
how it's done.

01:11:55.322 --> 01:11:56.824
I'll fucking break you.

01:11:59.258 --> 01:12:00.634
I'll fucking break you.

01:12:08.282 --> 01:12:10.135
Move over, Kyle,
my turn.

01:12:18.010 --> 01:12:19.899
Now you'll do one more
thing for me and that's it.

01:12:21.595 --> 01:12:22.746
No.

01:12:24.057 --> 01:12:26.007
No, you said this would be
the last thing.

01:12:26.009 --> 01:12:27.032
No, I didn't.

01:12:27.034 --> 01:12:28.344
Yes, you did.

01:12:28.346 --> 01:12:29.464
No, I didn't.

01:12:29.466 --> 01:12:30.682
One more thing.

01:12:33.241 --> 01:12:35.195
Do... you...

01:12:36.218 --> 01:12:37.435
like that?

01:12:38.361 --> 01:12:40.088
Yes.

01:12:40.090 --> 01:12:41.307
I can't hear you.

01:12:42.073 --> 01:12:43.227
I said, yes!

01:12:58.201 --> 01:13:00.058
Same time,
same place tomorrow.

01:13:00.505 --> 01:13:01.914
You disgust me.

01:13:03.226 --> 01:13:04.443
I'll tell Rick.

01:13:19.482 --> 01:13:21.271
Where are you going?

01:13:21.273 --> 01:13:22.650
I'm gonna tell him first.

01:13:23.513 --> 01:13:24.634
Fucking bitch!

01:13:26.489 --> 01:13:28.120
Put your clothes on.

01:13:28.122 --> 01:13:29.463
Get out.

01:13:29.465 --> 01:13:31.003
I said put your clothes on!

01:13:38.905 --> 01:13:39.962
Elise.

01:13:41.274 --> 01:13:42.491
I wasn't expecting
you back.

01:13:46.393 --> 01:13:49.242
I thought you'd be out
living the life of luxury.

01:13:52.826 --> 01:13:54.043
Rick, I found it.

01:13:58.937 --> 01:14:02.008
So have you heard?

01:14:02.010 --> 01:14:04.951
Rick has signed
all of the papers

01:14:04.953 --> 01:14:06.647
and everything over.

01:14:06.649 --> 01:14:08.442
And it looks like
I'll be filling in for him.

01:14:09.401 --> 01:14:11.128
I mean,
it's a shame, really,

01:14:11.130 --> 01:14:14.008
that he's given up everything
to be with such a...

01:14:14.010 --> 01:14:17.018
deceitful, unworthy slut.

01:14:19.929 --> 01:14:22.842
But hey, ho. Life shits on you sometimes.
What can you do?

01:14:24.026 --> 01:14:25.912
Have a great life, Elise.

01:14:25.914 --> 01:14:28.283
Well, whatever's left of it.

01:14:30.010 --> 01:14:31.450
Janet.

01:14:35.193 --> 01:14:37.306
Get the fuck out
of my house.

01:14:38.489 --> 01:14:39.866
Now.

01:14:52.857 --> 01:14:54.458
Elise, what are you
doing in here?

01:14:56.729 --> 01:14:58.363
What's the matter?
What's happened?

01:15:04.185 --> 01:15:05.975
- Rick...
- Shh.

01:15:05.977 --> 01:15:08.091
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Come on.

01:15:16.378 --> 01:15:17.851
I have to tell
you something.

01:15:22.170 --> 01:15:23.259
Right.

01:15:26.425 --> 01:15:28.855
I've been a bad person.
I'm sorry.

01:15:28.857 --> 01:15:30.359
I'm so, so sorry.

01:15:30.361 --> 01:15:31.866
What is it?

01:15:32.634 --> 01:15:33.818
Hmm?

01:15:37.786 --> 01:15:39.031
I need to...

01:15:39.033 --> 01:15:40.855
I need to ask you
something, okay?

01:15:40.857 --> 01:15:43.576
And I need you to be
completely honest with me

01:15:43.578 --> 01:15:44.631
and tell me the truth.

01:15:44.633 --> 01:15:46.010
Okay.

01:15:48.570 --> 01:15:50.359
Have you been
having an affair?

01:15:50.361 --> 01:15:51.319
Elise...

01:15:51.321 --> 01:15:53.848
Oh, please. Just...
Just tell me the truth.

01:15:53.850 --> 01:15:55.800
Of course not.

01:15:55.802 --> 01:15:57.146
Who have you been talking to?

01:15:57.946 --> 01:15:59.451
What is this?

01:15:59.642 --> 01:16:00.698
Hmm?

01:16:03.961 --> 01:16:05.499
I cheated on you.

01:16:07.674 --> 01:16:08.730
What?

01:16:10.458 --> 01:16:11.576
Rick, I'm sorry.

01:16:11.578 --> 01:16:13.463
- Elise, no.
- I'm sorry.

01:16:13.465 --> 01:16:14.491
I'm sorry.

01:16:17.946 --> 01:16:19.834
Rick, sit down.

01:16:20.154 --> 01:16:21.210
Who?

01:16:21.786 --> 01:16:22.905
Who was it?

01:16:25.145 --> 01:16:26.586
It was Felix.

01:16:28.633 --> 01:16:29.850
Felix?

01:16:30.937 --> 01:16:32.025
Rick, I'm sorry.

01:16:32.027 --> 01:16:34.522
Rick, I'm sorry.
It didn't mean anything. It was...

01:16:35.770 --> 01:16:37.176
How long?

01:16:37.178 --> 01:16:39.320
How long?

01:16:39.322 --> 01:16:41.435
I don't know. Like the past
couple of months or something.

01:16:49.561 --> 01:16:51.418
Don't look at me
like that.

01:16:57.369 --> 01:16:59.448
Did you like it more
with him than you did with me?

01:16:59.450 --> 01:17:01.016
No, no, no.

01:17:01.018 --> 01:17:03.896
Please, Rick. Please.

01:17:03.898 --> 01:17:05.115
Was it just with him?

01:17:12.761 --> 01:17:14.010
How...

01:17:14.970 --> 01:17:16.282
How many men?

01:17:18.362 --> 01:17:19.671
You don't wanna know.

01:17:19.673 --> 01:17:20.823
You are horrific.

01:17:20.825 --> 01:17:22.170
No, don't say that.

01:17:23.418 --> 01:17:25.144
I am gonna stay in
a hotel this evening...

01:17:25.146 --> 01:17:26.487
No, no, no!

01:17:26.489 --> 01:17:27.543
- And you are gonna pack your things,
- No, please.

01:17:27.545 --> 01:17:29.367
- and you ought to go.
- No.

01:17:29.369 --> 01:17:30.744
I want you
out of this house.

01:17:30.746 --> 01:17:32.056
No.

01:17:32.058 --> 01:17:34.264
- I want you gone.
- No, please.

01:17:34.266 --> 01:17:35.767
Don't say that.

01:17:35.769 --> 01:17:37.403
Rick! Don't.

01:17:40.857 --> 01:17:44.215
It all just got
completely out of control.

01:17:44.217 --> 01:17:46.010
He had this group
of men there

01:17:47.737 --> 01:17:49.401
waiting for me.

01:17:51.128 --> 01:17:52.055
He said...

01:17:52.057 --> 01:17:54.235
He said that if I went
through with it, that...

01:17:55.674 --> 01:17:57.111
he would leave me
alone, that...

01:17:57.113 --> 01:17:59.895
that would be the end of it
and the secret would be...

01:17:59.897 --> 01:18:02.583
would be safe
with him, but...

01:18:02.585 --> 01:18:04.635
But it was not the end of him.
He won't stop.

01:18:05.561 --> 01:18:06.650
He won't.

01:18:08.793 --> 01:18:11.286
Oh! Like, what kind
of a person would do that?

01:18:11.288 --> 01:18:14.360
What kind of a person would actually
agree to that and go through with it

01:18:14.362 --> 01:18:18.039
just to keep a dirty,
horrible lie from her husband?

01:18:18.041 --> 01:18:19.416
Go stay at a friend's house.

01:18:19.418 --> 01:18:20.760
Stay somewhere safe,
you know.

01:18:20.762 --> 01:18:22.042
With someone who
can give you support.

01:18:22.586 --> 01:18:23.703
Okay?

01:18:23.705 --> 01:18:25.432
Look, I know
Rick loves you.

01:18:25.434 --> 01:18:26.520
And after all of...

01:18:26.522 --> 01:18:28.856
everything that you two
have been through together,

01:18:28.858 --> 01:18:30.555
I know that you're both
gonna get through it.

01:18:32.601 --> 01:18:33.721
Okay?

01:18:36.314 --> 01:18:37.369
- Thank you.
- Come here.

01:18:39.288 --> 01:18:41.114
You're fine.
You're gonna get through it, okay?

01:18:43.194 --> 01:18:45.146
Look, I have to go,
but thank you so much.

01:18:45.848 --> 01:18:47.513
Be cautious, okay?

01:18:52.921 --> 01:18:54.234
B?

01:19:05.114 --> 01:19:06.297
B?

01:19:34.074 --> 01:19:35.162
Rick?

01:20:02.521 --> 01:20:03.546
Oh, my God!

01:20:04.953 --> 01:20:06.264
Rick!

01:20:06.266 --> 01:20:07.575
Rick, are you all right?

01:20:07.577 --> 01:20:09.433
Speak to me.
Speak to me.

01:20:15.033 --> 01:20:16.792
You got the message.

01:20:16.794 --> 01:20:18.202
Felix, what have you done?

01:20:22.297 --> 01:20:23.546
Sit down.

01:20:26.681 --> 01:20:27.897
Sit down.

01:20:38.424 --> 01:20:39.481
These are bad people.

01:20:42.842 --> 01:20:44.315
Do you know what they
were doing all along?

01:20:45.690 --> 01:20:48.568
Sneaking around
behind your back.

01:20:48.570 --> 01:20:50.744
All those worries of this one
sleeping with another woman.

01:20:50.746 --> 01:20:52.314
Well, ding dong,
you were right.

01:20:52.762 --> 01:20:53.915
It was this bitch.

01:20:58.426 --> 01:20:59.515
Is this true?

01:21:11.065 --> 01:21:12.474
Do you see it now?

01:21:13.592 --> 01:21:15.640
Hmm?

01:21:15.642 --> 01:21:17.946
I'm the only one who's ever been
here for you this whole time.

01:21:21.561 --> 01:21:23.033
Since that day
I saw you...

01:21:24.312 --> 01:21:25.625
at Bianca's.

01:21:29.304 --> 01:21:30.810
I was one of Bianca's
many men.

01:21:34.682 --> 01:21:36.090
You remember me,
don't you?

01:21:38.809 --> 01:21:41.526
I thought the first time we
met was at the office that day.

01:21:41.528 --> 01:21:43.287
So, what do you mean
Bianca's?

01:21:43.289 --> 01:21:45.752
What do you mean
you saw me there?

01:21:45.754 --> 01:21:48.090
She thought she'd just let
me go like I was nothing.

01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:55.127
You know, I was
there that day.

01:21:55.129 --> 01:21:57.049
All of those you were
seeing behind my back.

01:22:00.217 --> 01:22:01.753
But then I saw you.

01:22:02.521 --> 01:22:03.739
Everything changed.

01:22:16.281 --> 01:22:17.817
I saw in your desperation.

01:22:19.225 --> 01:22:20.762
Your need to be touched.

01:22:22.681 --> 01:22:23.993
To be desired.

01:22:24.633 --> 01:22:26.394
You're Felix?

01:22:27.833 --> 01:22:30.231
He told me he was Charlie.

01:22:30.233 --> 01:22:32.535
Didn't you learn your lesson
after the last one?

01:22:32.537 --> 01:22:35.287
That guy...
I can't remember what he was called.

01:22:35.289 --> 01:22:36.503
Charlie?

01:22:36.505 --> 01:22:37.687
Yeah, Charlie.

01:22:37.689 --> 01:22:40.310
Well, he was hot.
But he got weird as fuck, you know.

01:22:40.312 --> 01:22:43.063
He wouldn't stop texting
and calling me and stuff.

01:22:43.065 --> 01:22:46.552
It was a one-night stand,
and you couldn't let it go!

01:22:46.554 --> 01:22:49.402
Who the fuck
are you anyway?

01:22:50.489 --> 01:22:51.767
You don't wanna know
who I am.

01:22:51.769 --> 01:22:53.530
Get the fuck off of me.

01:22:57.849 --> 01:22:59.993
You know they were there
that day.

01:23:01.081 --> 01:23:02.426
At the cafe.

01:23:05.497 --> 01:23:07.033
It happened twice.

01:23:09.626 --> 01:23:10.938
It was over
before it started.

01:23:15.737 --> 01:23:16.698
Hello?

01:23:17.753 --> 01:23:19.606
Hey, can you come around?

01:23:19.608 --> 01:23:20.726
No, I can't right now.

01:23:20.728 --> 01:23:21.815
You can't do this to me.

01:23:21.817 --> 01:23:23.289
You think I'm
a one-night stand?

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:26.039
If you don't come
right now, Rick,

01:23:26.041 --> 01:23:27.515
I'm gonna tell Elise
everything.

01:23:28.217 --> 01:23:29.910
Okay, okay, yes.

01:23:29.912 --> 01:23:31.671
All right. Okay, I'll come
and meet you now.

01:23:31.673 --> 01:23:32.698
Okay, bye.

01:23:46.105 --> 01:23:48.090
I wanted to be
with you, Elise.

01:23:52.248 --> 01:23:54.104
That's why I quit my job.

01:23:54.106 --> 01:23:56.375
I wanted to make it
up to you,

01:23:56.377 --> 01:23:58.198
and be there for you.

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:00.247
Like I should've
always been.

01:24:00.249 --> 01:24:01.818
Shut the fuck up.

01:24:03.449 --> 01:24:05.368
Liar.

01:24:05.370 --> 01:24:06.746
Once a cheat,
always a cheat.

01:24:11.578 --> 01:24:13.177
Well, now
you know the truth,

01:24:14.970 --> 01:24:16.825
consider them
for what they truly are.

01:24:18.425 --> 01:24:20.058
You see them.

01:24:21.081 --> 01:24:22.714
And you see me.

01:24:23.545 --> 01:24:24.793
It's all black and white.

01:24:27.450 --> 01:24:29.782
Felix, this isn't right.

01:24:29.784 --> 01:24:31.290
Okay? You need
to let them go.

01:24:32.601 --> 01:24:33.721
Let them go?

01:24:34.745 --> 01:24:36.218
After what they've done?

01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:41.945
These two are the last
attachment.

01:24:43.193 --> 01:24:44.855
Once they're gone,
it's just us.

01:24:44.857 --> 01:24:47.062
Look, what they did
wasn't right,

01:24:47.064 --> 01:24:48.598
but neither was
what we did, okay?

01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:51.095
So please just put the knife
down and let them go.

01:24:51.097 --> 01:24:52.633
Are you serious?

01:24:53.657 --> 01:24:54.810
Hmm?

01:24:55.576 --> 01:24:57.623
Let them go?

01:24:57.625 --> 01:24:59.450
You just wanna forget it,
just like that?

01:25:00.538 --> 01:25:01.946
Hmm?

01:25:09.082 --> 01:25:11.671
No, no, no!
No, no, Felix.

01:25:11.673 --> 01:25:13.846
You know, Elise,
you've never been one to make decisions.

01:25:13.848 --> 01:25:14.998
No.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.022
I'll do the hard part.

01:25:16.024 --> 01:25:18.007
No! No! No!

01:25:21.465 --> 01:25:23.545
No! No!

01:25:24.281 --> 01:25:26.137
No! No! Please!

01:25:27.417 --> 01:25:28.794
No.

01:25:31.065 --> 01:25:32.154
No!

01:25:33.145 --> 01:25:34.266
No!

01:25:36.826 --> 01:25:37.881
Please, Rick.

01:25:41.561 --> 01:25:42.618
Rick.

01:25:53.016 --> 01:25:54.775
It's gonna be okay.

01:25:54.777 --> 01:25:56.246
It's gonna be all right.

01:25:56.248 --> 01:25:58.233
I promise. I promise.

01:26:00.984 --> 01:26:02.425
I'm sorry.

01:26:09.177 --> 01:26:12.314
Elise, please untie me.
Please untie me.

01:26:14.106 --> 01:26:15.098
It's okay.

01:26:22.809 --> 01:26:24.824
Go, go, go.
Go get help.

01:26:24.826 --> 01:26:26.614
Please forgive for me.

01:26:26.616 --> 01:26:28.312
Please.

01:26:28.314 --> 01:26:29.946
Just go.
Just go, okay? Just...

01:26:30.712 --> 01:26:32.151
Go, I said, go!

01:26:32.153 --> 01:26:33.242
Go now!

01:26:41.977 --> 01:26:43.930
Yes, I need the police.

01:26:44.696 --> 01:26:45.910
Yes, police.

01:26:45.912 --> 01:26:47.126
I need help, please.

01:26:47.128 --> 01:26:48.505
He's got a knife.

01:27:04.441 --> 01:27:05.945
No.

01:27:12.984 --> 01:27:14.615
I'm gonna come back
for you, okay?

01:27:14.617 --> 01:27:15.929
I need to go
and get help.

01:27:16.729 --> 01:27:17.946
You're gonna be fine.

01:27:18.712 --> 01:27:20.185
You're gonna be fine.

01:27:47.449 --> 01:27:48.506
B?

01:27:49.209 --> 01:27:50.170
B.

01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:53.143
B, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

01:27:53.145 --> 01:27:55.415
Come on, speak to me.

01:27:55.417 --> 01:27:58.167
Come on. Please.
Please speak to me.

01:27:58.169 --> 01:27:59.226
Come on.

01:28:04.409 --> 01:28:06.358
B, you're gonna
be fine, okay?

01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:07.574
I'm gonna go get help.

01:28:07.576 --> 01:28:08.599
I'm gonna get help.

01:28:08.601 --> 01:28:09.754
We're gonna be okay.

01:28:10.521 --> 01:28:12.310
I'm sorry.

01:28:12.312 --> 01:28:14.554
Don't. Please don't.

01:28:21.689 --> 01:28:22.937
I'm sorry.

01:28:42.714 --> 01:28:44.570
I'm so sorry
I hurt Rick.

01:28:49.786 --> 01:28:50.905
I need you, Elise.

01:28:53.561 --> 01:28:55.450
I don't love anyone
or anything but you.

01:28:59.064 --> 01:29:01.881
Do you understand?
I need to have you. You're mine.

01:29:04.985 --> 01:29:06.074
I don't know...

01:29:08.312 --> 01:29:09.977
why you rejected me before,

01:29:12.504 --> 01:29:14.105
why you said
we couldn't be together.

01:29:17.049 --> 01:29:18.490
It's because
you're married, isn't it?

01:29:21.272 --> 01:29:23.128
You can't leave him
because you're married.

01:29:24.217 --> 01:29:25.465
Till death
do you part, right?

01:29:30.809 --> 01:29:32.121
We can be together now.

01:29:34.329 --> 01:29:37.081
We can be together.

01:29:52.248 --> 01:29:53.433
Fuck you!

01:29:58.936 --> 01:30:00.537
What did you say?

01:30:01.529 --> 01:30:02.841
I said fuck you.

01:30:03.545 --> 01:30:04.570
Yeah, I heard you.

01:30:07.448 --> 01:30:08.504
Go on.

01:30:09.433 --> 01:30:10.616
Give them a show.

01:30:14.041 --> 01:30:16.022
I said fuck you!

01:30:21.305 --> 01:30:22.842
You don't have control.

01:30:24.025 --> 01:30:25.462
I do.

01:30:25.464 --> 01:30:26.521
No!

01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:29.305
Stop!

01:30:36.377 --> 01:30:38.202
You just don't
get it, do you?

01:30:42.136 --> 01:30:43.706
You never had the control.

01:30:47.897 --> 01:30:50.646
This whole time
you felt empowered,

01:30:50.648 --> 01:30:52.602
that's what we taught
you to do...

01:30:54.808 --> 01:30:57.145
I was hoping at last
you would know that.

01:30:58.649 --> 01:31:00.250
Look at you.

01:31:02.009 --> 01:31:03.354
Without me you're nothing.

01:31:17.753 --> 01:31:18.906
Without me you're nothing.

01:31:25.113 --> 01:31:26.426
No.

01:31:27.577 --> 01:31:28.858
Do you hear that?

01:31:30.328 --> 01:31:32.953
Without me, you are shit.

01:31:53.241 --> 01:31:55.226
You never had
the power here.

01:31:57.720 --> 01:31:58.841
I did.

01:32:04.568 --> 01:32:05.880
I did love you.

01:32:07.768 --> 01:32:09.177
But not anymore.

01:32:11.609 --> 01:32:12.634
Go on.

01:32:14.361 --> 01:32:15.514
Do it.

01:32:18.776 --> 01:32:19.768
I...

01:32:20.377 --> 01:32:21.658
made you.

01:32:25.144 --> 01:32:26.936
Fantasy over.

01:33:18.681 --> 01:33:22.106
Uh, and then moved on
to Bianca Matthew's house.

01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:24.986
Attacking and binding her,

01:33:26.008 --> 01:33:28.085
before moving on
to your place,

01:33:28.087 --> 01:33:30.904
to pick up his next target,
Mr. Styles.

01:33:32.952 --> 01:33:35.734
Felix...

01:33:35.736 --> 01:33:39.830
Well, we should stop referring
him as Felix now, really.

01:33:39.832 --> 01:33:42.873
It's very unlikely his name
was actually Felix.

01:33:44.249 --> 01:33:46.489
At the moment
he's a John Doe.

01:33:47.769 --> 01:33:50.966
There's next to no evidence
he ever existed.

01:33:50.968 --> 01:33:53.111
Can't you trace his
family or friends?

01:33:53.113 --> 01:33:55.671
Surely, someone
must know something.

01:33:55.673 --> 01:33:58.197
Oh, we followed up
every lead that we had.

01:33:58.199 --> 01:34:00.024
Each one was a dead end.

01:34:01.209 --> 01:34:03.738
So he really did have
no one, then.

01:34:11.416 --> 01:34:14.326
Elise, I know it's
a tough subject,

01:34:14.328 --> 01:34:16.888
but I might as well
run it by you. Um...

01:34:18.328 --> 01:34:20.025
As we have no contacts
for Felix,

01:34:21.944 --> 01:34:24.024
there's no one
to take his ashes.

01:34:26.008 --> 01:34:27.703
We can dispose
of them, obviously...

01:34:27.705 --> 01:34:28.857
No, no.

01:34:30.681 --> 01:34:32.505
It's fine. I can take them.

01:34:37.913 --> 01:34:41.110
Sorry to interrupt.
I just want another one.

01:34:41.112 --> 01:34:43.286
Good to see you've made
a full recovery, Mr. Styles.

01:34:43.288 --> 01:34:44.824
Well, I couldn't have done it
without this one.

01:34:47.833 --> 01:34:48.858
Or this one.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.439
Do you know what
you're having?

01:34:52.441 --> 01:34:53.562
A boy.

01:34:54.616 --> 01:34:56.601
Congratulations.

01:35:55.736 --> 01:35:57.592
This garden
is so beautiful.

01:36:01.016 --> 01:36:02.904
What will it be,
that is until...

01:36:04.089 --> 01:36:05.655
the little man
comes along.

01:36:21.016 --> 01:36:22.105
Who's that?

01:36:23.288 --> 01:36:24.505
It's no one.

01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:31.129
What?

01:36:32.344 --> 01:36:33.781
What? Do you want me
to get some water?

01:36:33.783 --> 01:36:35.127
Yeah, please.

01:36:35.129 --> 01:36:36.153
Okay.

01:36:37.207 --> 01:36:39.480
Thank you. Yeah.
