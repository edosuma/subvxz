03:02.474 --> 03:04.141
Bobby!

03:05.811 --> 03:08.855
Bobby, are you in there with Amada?
Bobby!

03:09.022 --> 03:12.316
- It's Jumbo.
- I'll be out in a second, Jumbo.

03:12.484 --> 03:13.609
You gotta come out.

03:13.777 --> 03:18.072
There's chicks dancing naked right
in the bar, in the lobby. Unbelievable.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.448
- We gotta go.
- What?

03:19.616 --> 03:21.701
- Bob!
- We gotta go.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.286
Oh, fuck, I forgot.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.121
Bob!

03:27.124 --> 03:28.791
Fucking animal.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.712
I gotta ask Mr. Buzhayev
if we can take the night off.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.630
I love you.

03:35.507 --> 03:39.343
I'm gonna run across the street.
You meet me at the car, okay?

03:40.137 --> 03:42.763
- Okay. Go.
- Amada...

03:42.931 --> 03:47.143
...l'm the luckiest man on the planet.
If I died right now, I'd be happy.

04:03.869 --> 04:06.162
Hey, Mr. Green,
thanks for hooking me up, man.

04:06.330 --> 04:07.705
How are you?

04:08.415 --> 04:09.582
- Hey, Bobby.
- Hey.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.459
You got the best club in Brooklyn.

04:11.627 --> 04:13.669
Just wait
till I take over Manhattan, baby.

04:13.837 --> 04:16.839
Hey, do me a favor. Get them
a couple of drinks, all right?

04:31.813 --> 04:36.233
Hey, baby, give me my purse.
I'm meeting the family tonight.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.527
I don't want Coco paying
for his shit tonight.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.322
Not after that little mix-up
we had last weekend, ladies.

04:41.490 --> 04:42.531
- All right.
- Bye.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.158
Bye, Amada. Good luck, girl.

04:52.501 --> 04:55.878
Take it off! Take it off!

05:02.719 --> 05:04.512
Hey, get the fuck down here!

05:04.680 --> 05:06.681
Hey, you! Get the fuck down!

05:09.559 --> 05:12.561
Calm down. Let's give them space.
Good looking out, Jumbo.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.063
No problem, Bob.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.440
Oh, what the fuck?!

05:16.608 --> 05:18.234
- Don't strain yourself.
- You got it.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.654
Looks like everything's under control.
I'll take my break.

05:21.822 --> 05:22.863
I didn't do nothing!

05:23.031 --> 05:25.241
You"re bleeding all over the place.
Go home.

05:25.409 --> 05:27.493
- Freddie, take him home.
- L didn"t do nothing.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.704
Go easy on them, Jumbo.

05:41.174 --> 05:44.260
I'm going across the street to see
the boss. Bring my car around.

05:44.428 --> 05:47.304
- You got it. I need you to come--
- Be right back.

05:53.854 --> 05:57.440
Hi, Kalina. Look at you.

05:57.941 --> 06:01.277
You wanna go with me to
the club, huh? Do a little dance?

06:03.905 --> 06:06.407
- Hey, everybody!
- Hey, Bobby.

06:06.575 --> 06:09.618
- Hey, Mr. Buzhayev, how are you?
- Look, she got the watch.

06:09.786 --> 06:13.122
Oh, yeah, it's great. I told you.
He's the best.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.291
- Yeah. Yeah.
- L know deals.

06:15.459 --> 06:16.459
Digital.

06:16.626 --> 06:20.254
Yeah, it's great. Hey, listen.
I gotta go do something tonight...

06:20.422 --> 06:23.299
...but Freddie will watch the place,
make the night drop later.

06:23.467 --> 06:26.260
Good. So how is my club doing?

06:26.428 --> 06:27.803
- Everything's fine.
- Good.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.931
For me? Just this one.

06:31.099 --> 06:34.435
Amada tells me I put on 5 pounds
every time I come over here.

06:34.603 --> 06:37.271
I'm telling you,
you guys are fattening me up.

06:38.315 --> 06:39.815
- Good?
- Excellent.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.443
Always. Real good. Excellent.

06:42.611 --> 06:44.320
Listen, Bobby...

06:44.988 --> 06:49.742
Next week you come by, we talk.
We talk about plans for you.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.161
We like what you do
at the club very much.

06:52.329 --> 06:54.330
- Yeah? All right.
- Yeah.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.165
- Good.
- Something more?

06:58.335 --> 07:01.128
More? I just said I can't eat it.
I can't even eat this.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.005
I can't have another bite.

07:03.632 --> 07:05.257
What are you doing to me?

07:05.425 --> 07:07.885
No, no, no, Amada's waiting.
I have to go.

07:08.053 --> 07:09.261
You"re too good to me.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.680
Why do I deserve this?

07:12.682 --> 07:16.185
- No, I gotta go.
- Where? Where you run off to?

07:29.658 --> 07:31.200
It's my bike. Don"t!

07:43.964 --> 07:46.173
- Keep being brave, okay?
- Thank you.

07:46.341 --> 07:47.383
Thank you.

07:52.889 --> 07:55.182
- Here comes the right. Watch the right.
- Catch.

07:55.350 --> 07:58.102
- Keep-- Keep it up. Keep the guard--
- Careful.

07:58.270 --> 08:00.312
- Sorry, babe. Keep--
- Joseph.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.148
- All right, hey. Hey.
- Joseph.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.441
- Hey, quit fooling around.
- Did he bag it?

08:04.609 --> 08:07.278
No, he never did. His gun jammed,
so he started crying.

08:07.445 --> 08:08.988
That's terrible. A nine-point?

08:09.156 --> 08:11.615
- Joseph, come on.
- Pop's calling. Look...

08:11.783 --> 08:13.993
...we'll go to Metropole,
cut loose a little.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.494
- You got it.
- Come over here.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.246
Gotcha.

08:19.082 --> 08:21.083
Get your picture taken.
It's your big night.

08:21.251 --> 08:23.335
- We took them already.
- The more, the better.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.588
- Get your face out there.
- Stevie, come here.

08:25.755 --> 08:28.007
The P.C. will see this in the magazine,
all right?

08:28.175 --> 08:30.843
- All right.
- Get used to it, it"s good. Come on.

08:31.386 --> 08:33.846
- Good.
- Thanks, chief.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.432
Go over there to Mommy,
all right?

08:36.600 --> 08:38.433
It's almost 11.
Where's your brother?

08:38.602 --> 08:41.352
If he comes at all, he'll come late, Pop.
You know him.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.441
Baby.

08:45.942 --> 08:47.443
There's cops all around.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.572
- They're all fucking drunk anyways.
- Give me some.

08:51.781 --> 08:55.618
- I'm nervous.
- Don't be nervous. They're harmless.

08:55.785 --> 08:58.954
Jumbo came through.
It's good, right?

09:00.123 --> 09:03.125
Yeah, it's good. Okay.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.219
You coming?

09:13.929 --> 09:17.848
Do we have to? I don't know if I can
fucking deal with them tonight.

09:18.016 --> 09:21.143
Come on, honey. It's your family.
You gotta support them.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.062
Hey, remember
what I told you, right?

09:23.230 --> 09:25.898
Nobody at the club knows about
my family. Not even Jumbo.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.108
I know. Baby, I won"t
say anything. Come on.

09:28.276 --> 09:31.570
Last thing I need is anybody
thinking I"m a fucking cop.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.282
- Never happen, baby.
- L could be a cop.

09:35.450 --> 09:37.993
- What do you have to do?
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit.

09:38.161 --> 09:42.206
Freeze. All right, spread them.
Spread them. Move!

09:42.374 --> 09:44.041
- Get him! Get him!
- Arrest her.

09:44.209 --> 09:47.127
- Where you going?
- Just kidding, officers.

09:47.295 --> 09:50.047
He must know someone
because I'm talking about--

09:50.215 --> 09:51.882
Shit. Oh, shit, look at this.

09:52.050 --> 09:54.885
Bobby. Bobby Grusinsky.
Is that you?

09:55.053 --> 09:57.805
It's me, Russ De Keifer
from across Union Turnpike.

09:57.973 --> 09:59.181
- How you doing?
- All right.

09:59.349 --> 10:02.309
- Still bartending at that Russian joint?
- I'm managing it now.

10:02.477 --> 10:04.019
Hey, listen to you.

10:04.187 --> 10:06.939
- Did he just call you "Grusinsky"?
- I'll talk to you later.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.107
That guy"s funny.

10:10.986 --> 10:12.820
Oh, my God.

10:17.033 --> 10:18.867
That's them.
In the corner down there.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.373
Hey, Pop.

10:27.836 --> 10:31.088
They don't look that bad,
though, for cops.

10:32.716 --> 10:34.383
All right, let's go.

10:35.010 --> 10:37.636
- He"s got company.
- Give me a break.

10:40.056 --> 10:43.058
- Here comes trouble.
- Look at you.

10:43.226 --> 10:45.561
- You came.
- Congratulations, you're moving up.

10:45.729 --> 10:48.689
Mr. Big Shot honors us
with his presence.

10:49.441 --> 10:51.400
- At your service. You look great.
- Thanks.

10:51.568 --> 10:53.402
Everybody,
this is my girlfriend, Amada.

10:53.570 --> 10:55.321
- That's my father...
- Nice to meet you.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.947
...Chief Burt Grusinsky.

10:57.115 --> 10:58.907
- My brother, Joe.
- Hi.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.576
That's Michael and Jack.

11:00.744 --> 11:02.286
You guys look good.

11:02.454 --> 11:06.749
- You put up with this guy?
- I'm a Leo. I can put up with anything.

11:08.251 --> 11:10.627
If you got a minute,
we'd like to talk to you.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.255
- Let"s get a drink first.
- No, right now. Right now.

11:13.715 --> 11:15.174
It's only gonna take a minute.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.259
- Upstairs in the church.
- "'Right now."'

11:17.427 --> 11:18.927
Come on.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.263
Don't worry. We'll bring him back
in one piece.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.190
That's a great crowd
you got down there, Joe.

11:31.358 --> 11:35.194
- You know all the right people.
- That's a nice suit you got, Bobby.

11:35.987 --> 11:37.071
Was that funny?

11:37.238 --> 11:39.990
I didn't know you had a sense
of humor, Michael. I like it.

11:40.158 --> 11:42.951
How much did that earring
set you back?

11:43.912 --> 11:46.038
- What?
- You heard what I said.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.582
Bobby, I asked Pop
to bring you up here.

11:49.417 --> 11:53.212
- Bobby. Please, I'm serious.
- Why? What's the matter?

11:54.297 --> 11:57.132
I'll be heading up this new
narcotics team starting this week.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.927
Russian unit
out of PSA-One in Brighton.

12:01.513 --> 12:03.055
What?

12:03.223 --> 12:05.140
You brought me up here
to tell me that?

12:10.397 --> 12:12.314
Do any of you fucking guys talk?

12:12.482 --> 12:15.776
- You ever say anything back there?
- I'm old-fashioned. I listen first.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.612
Oh, God. Excuse me.

12:18.780 --> 12:20.823
We"re looking at this guy,
Vadim Nezhinski.

12:21.991 --> 12:24.785
Served time in the Soviet Union
for black-market activity...

12:24.953 --> 12:29.915
...come over in 1979.
He's dealing H, cocaine, angel dust.

12:30.667 --> 12:33.669
This guy's bringing in major weight
and we need to track it.

12:34.921 --> 12:38.090
He's operating out of that spot
you manage, the El Caribe.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.844
Oh, I don't know nothing
about that. I'm not--

12:42.011 --> 12:44.721
No, we know. We checked
the rest of the management too...

12:44.889 --> 12:47.474
- ...his uncle, the owner.
- The old man?

12:47.642 --> 12:50.811
- Well, he is his uncle.
- You been fucking watching me too?

12:50.979 --> 12:55.190
Everybody else came up clean.
It's just Nezhinski we're looking at.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.903
You want me to inform?

13:00.530 --> 13:01.572
No.

13:01.739 --> 13:04.283
- Are you kidding me?
- Just observe, that's all.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.327
It's a closed community.
You"re our only way in right now.

13:08.079 --> 13:11.039
Great. You guys are the fucking cops.
Why are you coming to me?

13:11.207 --> 13:13.041
Why--? Why is this my problem?

13:14.210 --> 13:18.130
The whole city's falling apart. Don't
you have any sense of responsibility?

13:18.590 --> 13:20.340
Let me think.

13:20.508 --> 13:23.635
No. No, not really. I don't.
I got enough fucking problems, Joe.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.721
The streets are
in fucking chaos, Bobby.

13:25.889 --> 13:28.724
- Our guys are dropping like flies.
- Joseph, come on. I--

13:28.892 --> 13:33.061
Joseph, you go downstairs.
Let me talk to him, all right?

13:33.229 --> 13:36.064
- Yeah, thanks for coming.
- It's always a pleasure. Thank you.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.692
You better be careful out there
the next couple weeks.

13:38.860 --> 13:40.486
- What's that mean?
- You know.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.739
- Joseph.
- Fine, Pop. You fucking deal with him.

13:46.576 --> 13:49.578
- Take care, Bobby.
- Yeah.

13:51.414 --> 13:54.374
Move over. Move over.

13:57.545 --> 14:00.547
Been a long time
since we've seen you.

14:00.757 --> 14:03.217
Your brother says you don"t
answer the phone anymore.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.260
I've been busy, Pop. That's all.

14:05.428 --> 14:07.054
Yeah?

14:07.472 --> 14:09.723
What's going on with you?

14:12.644 --> 14:14.436
You can't talk?

14:15.104 --> 14:16.438
I don't know.

14:16.606 --> 14:18.482
You what?

14:18.650 --> 14:20.275
Things are all right.

14:20.443 --> 14:22.402
- You're all right?
- Yeah.

14:22.570 --> 14:23.737
Yeah?

14:23.905 --> 14:27.908
You know, I could"ve gotten you
a good job with us, a safe job.

14:28.368 --> 14:31.453
If you would have asked.
If you'd been around.

14:32.413 --> 14:34.790
I got a job. I got a job. A good job.

14:34.958 --> 14:37.918
That's the whole point
of this conversation we had.

14:38.086 --> 14:41.213
That's why your brother was here,
because of this club.

14:47.303 --> 14:50.639
Your brother says that you've been
using your mother's name these days.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.809
Yeah, just for the business.
You know, it"s easy.

14:53.977 --> 14:56.311
"Bobby Green'"?

14:56.479 --> 14:59.314
Well, people can pronounce it,
you know?

14:59.482 --> 15:02.818
That Puerto Rican you brought.
She been hooking you up?

15:03.820 --> 15:06.989
- What do you mean?
- Come on, I can smell it on you.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.074
You keep laughing.

15:09.242 --> 15:12.661
Your mother, rest in peace,
I think she was too easy on you.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.541
All right.

15:19.210 --> 15:21.336
I gotta go, Pop.

15:21.504 --> 15:24.673
Bobby, let me tell you something.

15:24.841 --> 15:29.303
Sooner or later,
either you're gonna be with us...

15:29.470 --> 15:32.222
...or you're gonna be
with the drug dealers.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.308
This is like a war out there.

15:35.143 --> 15:37.769
Now, do you understand that?

15:40.356 --> 15:41.481
Do you?

15:45.445 --> 15:46.737
I'll see you.

15:47.405 --> 15:49.197
Careful.

16:04.881 --> 16:07.549
It's getting late. How are
the kids doing? They tired yet?

16:07.717 --> 16:11.053
They"re always tired. They worry
about you when you're out at night.

16:11.220 --> 16:13.263
- Baby, sit up straight.
- Baby, do me a favor.

16:13.431 --> 16:15.182
Don't start, all right?

16:15.725 --> 16:18.268
Excuse me, everybody.
Can I have your attention, please?

16:20.730 --> 16:23.857
Hi, my name is Deputy Commissioner
Spiro Giavannis...

16:24.025 --> 16:27.527
...and we're here this holiday season
to honor one of our new leaders...

16:27.695 --> 16:28.779
Let's get out of here...

16:28.946 --> 16:30.906
- ...and go party with Jumbo.
- Why?

16:31.074 --> 16:34.409
Baby, your family don't like me,
I don't care. I"m here for you, okay?

16:34.577 --> 16:36.203
Fuck them. Let's go. It's boring.

16:36.371 --> 16:38.038
- They're stiffs. Yeah.
- Really?

16:38.206 --> 16:40.499
I'm sure the chief would like
to say a few words.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.251
So I'd like to bring him
up here now. Chief?

16:48.758 --> 16:50.592
Thank you. Thank you very much.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.302
Yeah, chief.

16:52.470 --> 16:55.931
You know, I used to tell my kids,
"Work first, play later."'

16:56.099 --> 16:59.267
And my son Joseph
really took that to heart.

17:00.061 --> 17:03.605
Been a real fighter over the years.
He overcome the dyslexia...

17:03.773 --> 17:07.818
...and eventually wound up
graduating John Jay as salutatorian.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.736
And hey...

17:09.904 --> 17:13.031
I'm very proud here tonight.

17:23.501 --> 17:27.546
I wanna thank you all for coming.
Happy Thanksgiving.

17:28.423 --> 17:30.132
Before I say anything else...

17:30.299 --> 17:33.385
...one of our brothers was killed
in the line of duty last night.

17:34.303 --> 17:35.971
Edward Conlon was gunned down...

17:36.139 --> 17:38.473
...serving a warrant
on Northern Boulevard.

17:38.641 --> 17:40.308
Hey. Come here.

17:40.476 --> 17:43.103
The clock is about to strike 11.

17:43.521 --> 17:47.232
I thought we might be able to give
a moment of silence to remember.

18:33.821 --> 18:36.281
- Come on, get over here.
- Which one?

18:36.783 --> 18:39.701
Come on, I'm meeting with Buzhayev
tonight. Which one? This one?

18:39.869 --> 18:41.995
That one. Hey, baby.

18:42.163 --> 18:43.872
- L got good news.
- Yeah?

18:44.040 --> 18:47.209
So I talked to my mom yesterday.
She"s feeling better.

18:47.376 --> 18:50.337
So I can move in whenever I want.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.049
Really?

18:55.092 --> 18:57.219
- Don't joke with me.
- I'm not.

18:57.386 --> 19:00.847
I like it. I like it.

19:01.224 --> 19:04.559
It's official. You get your side
of the bed, I get mine.

19:05.228 --> 19:07.562
Seriously, it's great news.

19:07.730 --> 19:11.024
- Hey, I got you something.
- What?

19:11.192 --> 19:14.236
You"ve been working so hard lately.

19:17.949 --> 19:20.617
- What is it?
- Open it up.

19:20.785 --> 19:22.994
- Now?
- Go ahead, open it.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.548
It's nice.

19:35.258 --> 19:37.008
I like it.

19:37.677 --> 19:38.844
Thank you.

19:39.178 --> 19:42.931
- L love you so much.
- L love you too, babe.

19:43.599 --> 19:45.809
We"ll have a lot of kids...

19:45.977 --> 19:48.895
- ...big house.
- Yeah?

19:50.439 --> 19:53.608
Can we get big kids
and a lot of houses?

19:53.943 --> 19:56.027
Hey, Bobby! Get your ass out here.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.614
It's probably Jumbo. Come on, let's
go hang out with them for a minute.

19:59.782 --> 20:02.284
Everybody, the life of the party
is here.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.244
Hey, Falsetti,
you get what we wanted?

20:04.412 --> 20:07.205
Absolutely. I got a little of
what everybody asked for here.

20:07.373 --> 20:11.293
I got uppers, I got downers.
Hash, mescaline, some blow.

20:11.460 --> 20:14.504
The troops require sustenance.

20:47.788 --> 20:49.706
Go, go, go!

20:54.503 --> 20:56.796
You gotta get dressed.
You gotta get dressed.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.840
Come on, get dressed.

20:59.008 --> 21:01.301
You can't be late
for the boss, baby.

21:09.226 --> 21:13.021
- Bobby!
- Well, hello, how are you?

21:13.439 --> 21:16.858
I thought you could ride. Not riding
so good. You don't ride bareback?

21:17.026 --> 21:18.735
How are you?

21:19.487 --> 21:20.987
- Bobby.
- You wouldn't believe it.

21:21.155 --> 21:26.034
It's 40 degrees out, line's halfway
around the block. It's unbelievable.

21:27.036 --> 21:28.995
I'll grab something in a second,
thank you.

21:31.874 --> 21:33.959
Take kids in the other room.

21:37.505 --> 21:38.713
Don't worry, kids.

21:38.881 --> 21:42.342
You will see Grandpa on Tuesday
to ride the horses.

21:43.052 --> 21:44.469
Not on the furs!

21:45.012 --> 21:46.179
- Bobby.
- Pop.

21:46.347 --> 21:48.139
- Have a seat.
- Why? What'd I miss?

21:48.307 --> 21:50.392
Listen, we"re thinking
about expanding.

21:50.893 --> 21:54.646
Maybe we'll open another spot
next year across from Brighton.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.564
- L like it.
- Yeah, good.

21:56.732 --> 22:00.568
And we think you"ll run it
and we'll do it exactly like here.

22:00.945 --> 22:02.278
- Could be good.
- Good?

22:02.446 --> 22:04.906
Good, yeah. Listen...

22:05.074 --> 22:08.493
...l've been thinking. If you wanna
open another spot, I mean...

22:08.661 --> 22:11.871
- ...why not try Manhattan?
- Manhattan's very expensive.

22:12.039 --> 22:13.248
Depends on where you go.

22:13.416 --> 22:16.001
I mean, you get in there now,
get something for cheap.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.420
I'm talking a big space,
a big warehouse.

22:18.587 --> 22:20.130
You get different levels going.

22:20.297 --> 22:22.465
We could do something different
on each floor.

22:22.633 --> 22:24.426
Like one floor could be rock 'n' roll.

22:24.593 --> 22:27.679
Then you do another floor,
you got disco. Something like that.

22:29.265 --> 22:31.641
He's got so many ideas!

22:32.059 --> 22:36.146
And don't let your hair-brained
nephew Vadim screw it up!

22:36.313 --> 22:38.523
It's a lot of money, Papa.

22:38.691 --> 22:42.444
Your fur business can
support that right now?

22:43.571 --> 22:46.072
My son-in-law, he worries people
take advantage of me.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.240
I understand that.

22:47.408 --> 22:49.909
But I think we can do something
special and different.

22:50.077 --> 22:52.245
Worst-case scenario,
it"s a great investment.

22:52.413 --> 22:54.789
I mean, I think
it"s worth looking into.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.333
All right.

22:57.501 --> 23:00.587
So bring some details.
We"ll figure out the numbers.

23:01.005 --> 23:02.464
- Yeah?
- Okay?

23:02.631 --> 23:04.049
Good.

23:04.592 --> 23:06.217
I love you.

23:15.436 --> 23:16.853
Hey, who is this?

23:17.021 --> 23:20.565
You are in the presence
of the future king of New York.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.776
The future king?
What are you talking about?

23:22.943 --> 23:25.487
Listen, nothing's definite
so don't say anything.

23:25.654 --> 23:27.072
I was just with Mr. Buzhayev.

23:27.239 --> 23:29.783
He's talking about opening
another spot in Manhattan.

23:29.950 --> 23:34.412
He wants me to run it.
I want you, my brother, to be a host.

23:34.580 --> 23:37.665
Of course! I'm a people person.
That's my specialty.

23:37.833 --> 23:40.001
- L know.
- My fucking man.

23:40.169 --> 23:42.003
I'm the "hoster"' with the "'moster."'

23:42.171 --> 23:45.006
That's beautiful news, Bob.
Beautiful.

23:45.466 --> 23:48.468
Now you'll finally be getting me
all the women I deserve.

23:48.636 --> 23:50.345
What's Amada doing
at Vadim's table?

23:52.848 --> 23:56.601
She"s doing what she's supposed
to do. She's charming the customers.

23:56.769 --> 24:01.397
- What do you hear about him, Jumbo?
- L don't know what I hear.

24:02.024 --> 24:05.193
- L hear stories.
- You hear stories. Like what?

24:05.361 --> 24:06.694
Stories.

24:07.488 --> 24:11.116
Like last year, one of his guys
was gonna rat him out.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.118
Cops found his head
on Brighton Avenue.

24:13.285 --> 24:17.122
- Fucking dick was in his mouth.
- Sure it wasn't your dick?

24:18.207 --> 24:20.583
Are you sure it wasn't your mouth?

24:24.421 --> 24:27.882
But I tell you, he wouldn't be
running around here like a king...

24:28.050 --> 24:30.677
...if his uncle didn't own the place,
that much I know.

24:30.845 --> 24:32.053
I gotta get back to work.

24:32.221 --> 24:34.931
All right. Nice talking to you. Bye.

24:35.724 --> 24:37.183
I'm gonna go talk to Amada.

24:37.935 --> 24:41.396
- All right, I'll see you later.
- I'll be downstairs.

24:50.906 --> 24:53.741
I was just telling her how you
stuffed a pill up her nose.

24:53.909 --> 24:56.661
Yeah, that's going
on the wall of shame.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.122
See you later.

24:59.915 --> 25:01.374
Hey, babe, listen.

25:01.542 --> 25:04.252
I don't think you should be around
Vadim so much right now.

25:04.420 --> 25:06.296
Why? You jealous?

25:06.463 --> 25:09.465
No, I'm not jealous. Listen,
it"s nothing for you to worry about.

25:09.633 --> 25:10.633
Okay.

25:10.801 --> 25:13.094
I wanna tell you about
my meeting with Buzhayev.

25:13.262 --> 25:14.429
This is the police!

25:14.597 --> 25:17.015
- This is a raid!
- Let"s go.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.851
- Police!
- Fuck.

25:20.227 --> 25:23.271
Let's find this motherfucker right now.
Let's go.

25:25.441 --> 25:26.816
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

25:26.984 --> 25:29.319
Everybody get your hands
on your fucking heads.

25:29.486 --> 25:32.071
- Let go of me, man.
- Get the fuck down!

25:38.120 --> 25:40.955
Empty your pockets! Oh, jackpot.

25:41.123 --> 25:44.042
- Get on the bar. Hands on the bar.
- Who authorized this?

25:44.210 --> 25:46.336
Tell me who authorized it.
I have the right--

25:46.503 --> 25:48.713
What's the matter? You on
something? Come here.

25:48.881 --> 25:52.634
That's right. Hands on your
fucking head and don"t move!

25:52.801 --> 25:55.136
- Hey, easy, easy.
- Toss them all, Pudge!

25:55.304 --> 25:58.139
- Where is he?
- Get on-- Get on the fucking ground!

25:58.307 --> 26:00.558
Give him the charcoal.
Open your fucking mouth!

26:00.726 --> 26:02.185
Who the fuck authorized this?

26:02.353 --> 26:05.772
- I'm looking for Vadim Nezhinski.
- He must be on something.

26:06.273 --> 26:08.441
Get the fucking charcoal.
You do a little dust?

26:08.609 --> 26:11.277
- Bring him the fuck down here!
- Get this piece of shit up.

26:11.445 --> 26:13.947
- Where is he?
- He"s up here, captain! We got him.

26:14.114 --> 26:16.282
How about some charcoal
to absorb the toxins?

26:16.450 --> 26:18.534
Clear some space here
for me, ladies, please.

26:18.702 --> 26:20.995
- Turn him, he's gonna puke.
- Where's Nezhinski?

26:22.081 --> 26:23.957
- Get this piece of shit up.
- Here we go.

26:24.124 --> 26:26.834
- Give me some space here, please.
- Get the fuck out here.

26:27.002 --> 26:28.670
- Who else?
- Don't you move.

26:28.837 --> 26:30.088
- Turn around.
- Here we go.

26:30.256 --> 26:32.840
What are you looking at?
Turn your head the other way.

26:38.973 --> 26:41.516
Turn around.

26:42.893 --> 26:45.853
- What is this?
- Stay down, stay down.

26:46.480 --> 26:48.147
Tough guy, huh?

26:48.315 --> 26:50.275
What, you want me
to double your money?

26:53.988 --> 26:55.488
- Stay down.
- There it is.

26:55.698 --> 26:58.533
It's doubled. How's that?

26:59.618 --> 27:01.703
What are you looking at?
Turn around.

27:03.539 --> 27:07.333
What else you got in here, huh,
joker? What about the girls?

27:08.502 --> 27:10.795
Come here.
You got anything in here?

27:14.425 --> 27:16.384
You got a cross and a Jewish star
on you.

27:16.552 --> 27:18.970
- What's the matter? You confused?
- Not me.

27:21.056 --> 27:22.598
- What we got?
- This one's holding.

27:22.766 --> 27:25.226
- Couple dimes of cocaine, some PCP.
- Good.

27:25.394 --> 27:28.479
You and you are under arrest.
Possession and sale of narcotics.

27:28.647 --> 27:31.065
Talk to them and
we go after your mother.

27:31.233 --> 27:33.735
What the fuck
did you just say to him?

27:34.403 --> 27:36.070
Nothing.

27:36.780 --> 27:41.200
Your boy's gonna open up on you.
And when he does, I"m coming back.

27:42.870 --> 27:44.912
All right. Let's go.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.581
Come on!

27:47.207 --> 27:51.586
Good night, everybody. Pleasure
doing business with you. Wrap it up.

27:52.796 --> 27:53.921
Let's go.

27:54.923 --> 27:56.758
- Mr. Buzhayev.
- Yes?

27:56.925 --> 27:59.385
- I'm Captain Jack Shapiro.
- Nice to meet you.

27:59.553 --> 28:01.137
This has nothing to do with you...

28:01.305 --> 28:03.848
...but do you have a nephew
named Vadim Nezhinski?

28:04.016 --> 28:06.601
- Yes.
- Does he have an office here?

28:06.769 --> 28:09.771
Clean him up. I don't want to
get it all over the car.

28:09.938 --> 28:11.689
You got him dirty, you clean him up.

28:12.649 --> 28:14.734
- Does he have an office here?
- No.

28:14.902 --> 28:16.444
Okay.

28:17.321 --> 28:19.197
We"ll be in touch.

28:19.365 --> 28:21.282
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.789
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my God!

28:27.956 --> 28:30.291
- How the fuck did he get out here?
- Get out!

28:30.459 --> 28:33.461
- What do you got?
- Possession and resisting arrest.

28:33.629 --> 28:35.880
He's also got $207 on him.

28:36.048 --> 28:38.174
- Two-oh-seven? Take him in the back.
- Let"s go.

28:38.342 --> 28:40.885
- Who frisked this asshole?
- Don't forget the pedigree.

28:41.053 --> 28:43.388
- All right.
- We gotta stop the bleeding.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.015
- What do you got?
- He"s bleeding all over the place.

28:46.183 --> 28:48.643
- Don't touch him!
- Jesus Christ, what the fuck?

28:48.811 --> 28:50.895
- The Russian guy cut himself open.
- Jesus.

28:51.063 --> 28:53.481
- Where'd he get the blade?
- He had it on him, man.

28:54.858 --> 28:56.859
Hey, hey.
What the fuck is going on in here?

28:57.027 --> 28:59.654
- He cut his throat.
- He pulled some cutting, man.

28:59.822 --> 29:03.074
Put pressure on him, all right?
Put pressure.

29:03.659 --> 29:05.910
Why are you standing there?
Get us a fucking bus.

29:06.078 --> 29:08.079
All right, all right, all right.

29:08.831 --> 29:10.623
Shit.

29:18.340 --> 29:20.049
Good morning, chief.

29:25.222 --> 29:27.265
You ready to go home?

29:27.433 --> 29:29.350
Or do you have a home?

29:32.521 --> 29:34.355
Your brother wanted me
to let you out.

29:34.523 --> 29:38.192
If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here
another couple of days or a week.

29:38.360 --> 29:40.653
- Maybe a month.
- Do you want me to thank him?

29:42.114 --> 29:44.157
Disgusting.

29:46.118 --> 29:48.953
You"re uncontrollable. You know?

29:51.081 --> 29:53.207
Give him a bath.

29:53.709 --> 29:56.002
I ought to rap you one.

30:04.261 --> 30:08.139
Hey, sign out with the desk sergeant
before you leave, please.

30:11.894 --> 30:14.145
Guy cut his own throat.
Nezhinski must've...

30:14.313 --> 30:16.689
- ...really put the fear of God in him.
- Look...

30:16.857 --> 30:19.358
...that guy knew how they're
bringing the product in.

30:19.526 --> 30:20.902
- Absolutely.
- That's the key.

30:21.069 --> 30:23.738
We find the right guy,
we're gonna get him...

30:38.629 --> 30:42.757
We waited till it was your day off.
We had to go. I "m sorry. That"s it.

30:42.925 --> 30:45.092
You had to hit that spot.
Of all the places...

30:45.260 --> 30:48.513
- ...you gotta come to my place?
- That's where Nezhinski"s been seen.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.515
We supposed to
announce it in advance...

30:50.682 --> 30:53.601
...and compromise the whole thing?
I told you I'm very sorry--

30:53.769 --> 30:57.021
Sorry"s not good enough. You don't
come in, act like you own the place.

30:57.189 --> 30:59.106
Got your guys putting shit
down my throat!

30:59.274 --> 31:02.610
You want me to come in here, fuck
everything up, push everything around?

31:02.778 --> 31:04.862
You wouldn't be in this
if you didn't fuck around!

31:05.030 --> 31:08.491
No, I wouldn't be in this shit
if you weren't trying to be top cop.

31:08.659 --> 31:11.536
You know fucking Nezhinski's guy?
His fucking throat cut open.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.454
Congratulations, Captain Joe.
Good job!

31:13.622 --> 31:16.582
Think you're above it? You fuck
around with your Puerto Rican?

31:16.750 --> 31:19.877
- Grow up and act like a man--
- Try thinking about my Puerto Rican...

31:20.045 --> 31:22.588
...while trying to fuck your fat wife!
How's that?

31:24.466 --> 31:26.008
- Knock it off! Bobby!
- Get off!

31:27.135 --> 31:28.302
- Come on!
- Get off me!

31:30.639 --> 31:32.306
Don't touch me! You're not Pop!

31:32.599 --> 31:35.893
I'm done with you. I don't wanna
see your fucking face anymore.

31:36.061 --> 31:37.979
Get out of here!

31:42.943 --> 31:44.652
I'm going home.

31:46.321 --> 31:48.489
It's a fucking holiday.

32:02.671 --> 32:04.171
Winter, spring, summer, fall...

32:04.339 --> 32:08.843
...call 966-7210 for reservations
at Pocono Gardens and...

32:09.011 --> 32:12.680
Beautiful Mount Airy Lodge.

32:23.191 --> 32:24.275
Shit.

32:50.135 --> 32:51.469
Jab, combination.

32:51.637 --> 32:56.349
Come on, dig. Dig. Come on.
Dig! Dig! Dig! Combination.

32:56.516 --> 33:00.061
Combination. Jab. Jab. Jab.
Combination.

33:00.228 --> 33:02.188
Dig. Dig. Dig. With authority.

33:02.356 --> 33:05.691
Dig. Dig. Finish it up.
With authority.

33:05.859 --> 33:07.860
That's it. That's it.

33:08.028 --> 33:10.404
Good. Take a rest. Take a rest.

33:15.661 --> 33:17.912
- Chief.
- Yeah.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.087
Which kid is it?

33:30.634 --> 33:34.095
It's Joseph.
He's in Jamaica Hospital.

33:34.262 --> 33:37.598
It don't look good right now.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.893
Want us to contact
your other son, chief?

33:41.061 --> 33:44.105
No, I'll do that. Thanks.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.232
You okay, chief?

33:46.400 --> 33:50.111
You guys go on.
I'll be right out. Thank you.

33:57.911 --> 34:00.621
- Chief.
- Yo, chief. You all right?

34:00.789 --> 34:03.624
I'm all right. I'm all right.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.752
C-note.

34:14.010 --> 34:16.262
Come on, man. Let's go.

34:17.514 --> 34:20.141
All right, tell you what, JosÃ©.

34:20.308 --> 34:22.101
I'll see you...

34:25.397 --> 34:27.523
...and I"ll bump you two C's.

34:39.286 --> 34:40.828
Call.

34:42.164 --> 34:43.205
Hello.

34:43.373 --> 34:47.710
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to
introduce you to JosÃ©'s new friends...

34:47.878 --> 34:51.172
...Siegfried and Roy. Two queens.

34:52.382 --> 34:54.967
- Hey, Bobby.
- How you like that, huh?

34:55.677 --> 34:58.471
- Bobby!
- What? Hang up on them.

34:58.638 --> 35:01.515
What you got?
Come on, you fold with that?

35:01.683 --> 35:04.059
- That's what--
- It's the police.

35:04.227 --> 35:07.271
All right, all right, deal again.
Deal again. I'm feeling hot!

35:07.439 --> 35:09.482
JosÃ©, I thought you knew
how to play poker.

35:09.649 --> 35:11.984
I told him to keep going.
He was gonna pack it in.

35:12.152 --> 35:14.278
Go fuck yourself
and just deal the cards.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.155
- Hello.
- Bobby?

35:16.323 --> 35:17.907
Yeah.

35:18.074 --> 35:20.868
Bobby, it's Michael Solo.
I got some bad news.

35:21.036 --> 35:23.704
It's your brother.
Your brother"s been shot.

35:23.872 --> 35:27.208
About an hour ago,
outside his house.

35:27.375 --> 35:28.375
What? Who?

35:28.543 --> 35:31.962
Can you hear me? Your brother's
been shot. He's at Jamaica Hospital.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.756
They're working on him now.

35:33.924 --> 35:36.175
What are you talking about?
I was just with him.

35:36.343 --> 35:38.219
Listen, your father's coming.
I gotta go.

35:38.386 --> 35:42.223
But he's at Jamaica.
I just thought you should know.

35:44.726 --> 35:46.227
What happened?

35:49.898 --> 35:52.066
- My brother was shot.
- Oh, my God.

35:56.279 --> 35:57.696
They're operating on him--

35:57.864 --> 36:00.032
They're operating on him right now.
I gotta--

36:00.200 --> 36:01.742
Bobby.

36:01.910 --> 36:04.912
- Where are my keys?
- They should be on your desk.

36:05.413 --> 36:08.415
- I'll get my coat. I'll go with you.
- No. No.

36:08.583 --> 36:10.668
Stay here tonight.
I'll call you later.

36:10.836 --> 36:14.630
- Bobby, I wanna go with you.
- No. I'll call later.

36:15.966 --> 36:17.633
Bobkes?

36:17.801 --> 36:21.095
- Where you going?
- Deal the cards, man.

36:34.317 --> 36:37.653
Pop, Joe gonna be all right?

36:38.655 --> 36:40.114
He's all right?

36:42.033 --> 36:43.951
You got into a fight with him,
I heard.

36:44.995 --> 36:48.706
- No.
- Well, you got what you wanted...

36:48.874 --> 36:51.083
...and you stayed out of it.

36:51.793 --> 36:53.168
- Burt.
- Why would you say that?

36:53.336 --> 36:56.297
- The union sent a shrink over for you.
- L don't need that crap.

36:57.132 --> 36:58.424
- Your Honor.
- Chief.

36:59.551 --> 37:02.636
- Chief, I'm sorry.
- What happened, Michael? Tell me.

37:02.804 --> 37:04.638
- What's going on?
- I'm glad you're here.

37:04.806 --> 37:06.765
First, I wanna tell you
how sorry I am.

37:07.434 --> 37:10.686
We'll get them, Your Honor.
I'll come back in and run it myself.

37:10.854 --> 37:13.188
The bullet went into his cheek,
came out his jaw.

37:13.356 --> 37:15.232
- It missed his brain, thank God.
- Jesus.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.942
He's very lucky, considering.

37:17.986 --> 37:19.153
Do you know who did it?

37:20.322 --> 37:21.655
No.

37:21.907 --> 37:24.658
Definitely a professional.
They bombed his car.

37:25.243 --> 37:28.662
It's a calling card.
We think it's the Russians.

37:29.873 --> 37:33.667
You know, it's a real shame
we didn't get to Nezhinski before this.

37:35.962 --> 37:37.671
Are you fucking blaming me?

37:39.549 --> 37:41.008
No.

37:41.635 --> 37:44.845
But I'm not the only one
around here with an opinion.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.810
Best-case scenario...

37:51.978 --> 37:56.231
...doctor says your brother will have to
be here for at least a couple months.

37:56.942 --> 37:58.150
Anyway...

37:58.360 --> 38:01.362
...let's just--
Let's just hope he pulls through.

38:01.529 --> 38:03.489
I'm going to see him.

38:08.954 --> 38:10.454
- Easy.
- Nobody's allowed in...

38:10.622 --> 38:12.706
- ...except immediate family.
- I'm his brother.

38:12.874 --> 38:14.291
I'm his fucking brother!

38:14.459 --> 38:16.543
Officers, hold on!
Let him in. It's all right.

38:16.711 --> 38:19.546
- His nametag says "Green."
- It's his brother.

38:19.714 --> 38:21.423
Okay, boss.

39:28.199 --> 39:30.701
I'm sorry, Joe.

40:33.473 --> 40:37.142
This guy got two queens
and he bumps the guy $200?

40:37.310 --> 40:41.105
And then he wins and where the fuck
do you run off to, like a Jew, huh?

40:41.272 --> 40:43.107
The place went fucking bananas.

40:43.274 --> 40:46.527
I gotta straighten things out. I had
to bust some heads like Bruce Lee.

40:46.694 --> 40:48.695
I'm in there busting fucking heads.
They--

40:48.863 --> 40:51.323
All right, Jumbo?
Jumbo, do me a favor.

40:51.491 --> 40:54.201
Would you grab the check?
Let's get out of here. I'm tired.

40:54.369 --> 40:57.037
All right, fine. I'll go pay the check.

40:57.205 --> 41:00.999
But, Bob, just don't forget that nobody
could ever do for you what I did.

41:01.167 --> 41:03.418
Busting heads.

41:03.586 --> 41:06.588
Hey, don't say nothing to Jumbo
about what happened, all right?

41:06.756 --> 41:10.008
Of course. I just thought he could
cheer you up a little, that's all.

41:10.176 --> 41:12.052
- Thanks.
- Look who's here.

41:14.013 --> 41:15.556
- Hi, Vadim.
- Hey.

41:15.723 --> 41:17.766
We were just about to leave.

41:19.644 --> 41:21.687
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.

41:22.355 --> 41:24.064
Made it through the bust okay?

41:24.232 --> 41:27.985
- I'm here.
- Good. Good. Glad to hear it.

41:29.445 --> 41:31.655
Your uncle's got some
trouble now, though.

41:31.823 --> 41:33.907
You fucked up the club.

41:34.951 --> 41:37.411
He does what he's gotta do,
I do what I got to do.

41:37.579 --> 41:39.329
He don't own me.

41:39.497 --> 41:42.374
He's got grandkids to worry about,
chasing them around.

41:49.465 --> 41:53.427
Hey, baby, go keep Jumbo company
for a sec, all right?

41:54.929 --> 41:56.680
Nice girl you got there.

41:56.848 --> 41:59.433
One is prettier than the other.
He knows everybody.

41:59.601 --> 42:01.018
He's pretty popular.

42:01.811 --> 42:06.315
You must know a whole network
of people. Clubs, everything, huh?

42:06.983 --> 42:09.067
Listen...

42:10.153 --> 42:12.571
...l got some shit coming in.

42:12.989 --> 42:15.991
And some of us think maybe
you could help us get it out there.

42:16.451 --> 42:18.785
My product needs a reputation.

42:18.953 --> 42:21.121
A little dangerous right now,
don't you think?

42:22.081 --> 42:24.541
We got a lot of muscle behind this.

42:26.002 --> 42:28.629
- Muscle?
- Yeah, that's right.

42:29.130 --> 42:31.506
You know a cop got hit today?

42:31.925 --> 42:34.468
Do you think
that was a coincidence?

42:38.598 --> 42:41.975
Well, they're not gonna
sit still for that, you know?

42:42.268 --> 42:44.144
Police are a fucking joke, dude.

42:44.646 --> 42:46.730
Mickey Mouse ain't gonna
do nothing.

42:47.982 --> 42:50.901
Cop got lucky. He zigged
when he should have zagged.

42:51.069 --> 42:52.819
You sit with them.

42:59.494 --> 43:01.036
Bobby.

43:01.913 --> 43:03.705
The cops...

43:03.873 --> 43:05.582
...they ain't no problem.

43:05.750 --> 43:08.252
So don't worry about it.
We'll get them all.

43:08.419 --> 43:12.339
You cut the head off, the body will fall.
Am I right?

43:13.424 --> 43:16.051
We do it until they get the message.

43:16.552 --> 43:20.097
We just heard that cop's father
is going to be in charge now.

43:20.265 --> 43:22.099
We'll get him too.

43:24.060 --> 43:27.604
We got all their names on a list.

43:28.439 --> 43:31.566
The chief of police will be next.

43:33.152 --> 43:36.321
If you change your mind, call Pavel.

43:37.490 --> 43:38.782
I got a great product.

43:38.950 --> 43:41.410
Why don't you come down
and check it out for yourself?

43:41.577 --> 43:43.120
All right.

43:52.005 --> 43:53.213
Well, you're wrong, chief.

43:53.381 --> 43:55.340
We gotta make a move.
We gotta make it now.

43:55.508 --> 43:58.635
- No! We don't go nuts.
- You heard what Bobby just said.

43:58.803 --> 44:01.179
Nezhinski's got a contract
out on us, Burt.

44:01.347 --> 44:04.391
I know that. You wanna
take over my department?

44:04.559 --> 44:06.351
You wanna run it?
What do you wanna do?

44:06.519 --> 44:08.687
- L want an answer from you.
- Answer for what?

44:08.855 --> 44:13.066
I have no answers now.
We're looking for him, all right?

44:13.359 --> 44:17.404
Use your head. If we go arrest them,
they'd be back on the street in a day.

44:17.572 --> 44:19.740
We gotta catch them
with their hands full...

44:19.907 --> 44:22.993
...find out where they got the real
weight, then we make the move.

44:23.161 --> 44:26.079
- We don't have that much time.
- Doesn't matter. It's the right play.

44:26.247 --> 44:27.581
- L say we hit them all.
- What?

44:27.749 --> 44:30.876
- Wipe them out. No survivors.
- Don't be a first-class schmuck.

44:31.044 --> 44:34.296
- We don't have the time to infiltrate.
- That is exactly my point.

44:34.464 --> 44:36.048
Then we make the time.

44:36.215 --> 44:38.425
- At whose expense?
- Hold on!

44:38.593 --> 44:40.969
I want you all
to understand something, all right?

44:41.137 --> 44:44.264
We don't ever play in the dirt here.
Not ever, no matter what.

44:44.849 --> 44:48.352
When you piss in your pants,
you can only stay warm for so long.

44:51.647 --> 44:52.898
Bobby.

44:53.066 --> 44:55.942
Is there anything else you know
or anything you can tell us?

44:58.112 --> 45:00.280
Nezhinski come in and...

45:00.698 --> 45:03.825
...he was saying they're trying
to create a brand name, that they...

45:03.993 --> 45:05.994
...wanna corner the market.

45:06.287 --> 45:08.330
Why did he tell you this?

45:09.248 --> 45:13.210
I don't know. He thought
I could help him build a reputation.

45:13.461 --> 45:15.212
Nice friends you got there.

45:15.380 --> 45:18.382
Know what, Pop? He's not my friend.
All right? He came at me.

45:18.883 --> 45:19.925
All right.

45:20.093 --> 45:22.386
I'm not interested in that.
I don't deal.

45:22.553 --> 45:24.012
But didn't you lead him on?

45:24.180 --> 45:26.223
No, I didn't fucking lead him on.

45:26.391 --> 45:30.143
The guy's crazy. He told me
I could come look at his operation.

45:30.311 --> 45:32.813
- L didn't even ask.
- He talked about his operation?

45:33.773 --> 45:35.607
Maybe that's it. Maybe that's key.

45:35.775 --> 45:37.651
What's your point?

45:37.819 --> 45:40.445
We put a Kel on him.
Then send one of our uncles in.

45:40.613 --> 45:42.948
Wait a minute. Wait.
Who's gonna be the tail?

45:43.783 --> 45:47.452
No, forget about it. No way.
No. Forget it. Forget it!

45:47.620 --> 45:50.288
You go to his spot, right?
And you let him talk.

45:50.456 --> 45:52.290
You let him hang himself.

45:52.458 --> 45:55.001
And then we trail you,
you know, to the location.

45:55.169 --> 45:56.837
A week later, we pop him.

45:57.004 --> 45:59.256
And your name's cleared.
Nobody knows it's you.

45:59.424 --> 46:02.134
Mike, it's too dangerous for him.
He's my son.

46:02.301 --> 46:05.554
- He's connected to all of us.
- No one knows I'm connected to you.

46:05.721 --> 46:09.057
- What?
- L don't talk about you.

46:10.518 --> 46:13.520
What about your girlfriend?
She knows about you, right?

46:16.399 --> 46:17.774
Yeah.

46:18.860 --> 46:22.362
All right, leave me alone
a minute. Okay?

46:23.531 --> 46:28.702
I gotta fill out these line-of-duty reports
for your brother, for Joseph.

46:37.712 --> 46:40.046
I didn't know this
was gonna happen, Pop.

46:41.257 --> 46:42.924
Yeah, well...

46:43.092 --> 46:45.343
...what can you do, right?

46:47.180 --> 46:49.139
I don't want you to get hurt.

46:49.849 --> 46:53.351
Don't worry about me.
Just worry about yourself.

46:53.519 --> 46:56.730
I hear anything about your brother,
I'll call you. Goodbye.

47:00.776 --> 47:02.903
Goodbye.

47:35.811 --> 47:37.854
Hey, baby.

47:38.022 --> 47:39.981
Hey, babe.

47:41.567 --> 47:45.070
How's your father?
Is he holding up okay?

47:45.238 --> 47:48.281
- Yeah.
- Good.

47:48.449 --> 47:51.743
I heard on the television
your brother's doing better.

47:54.121 --> 47:57.123
Me and my mom,
we said a prayer for him.

47:58.543 --> 48:00.377
Thanks, baby.

48:01.796 --> 48:03.964
Did they find out who did it?

48:09.178 --> 48:10.428
Baby?

48:15.476 --> 48:17.435
It was Vadim.

48:18.896 --> 48:21.523
Vadim shot Joseph.

48:21.691 --> 48:27.445
Oh, my God.

48:27.613 --> 48:29.948
They tried to tell me...

48:30.116 --> 48:33.827
- ...but I didn't listen.
- Oh, my God.

48:33.995 --> 48:37.497
Bobby, what are we gonna do?

49:08.529 --> 49:09.988
Michael.

49:15.202 --> 49:16.536
Hey.

49:20.291 --> 49:21.708
You been up to see Joe?

49:21.876 --> 49:26.254
Yeah. He's doing much better.
They reset his jaw this morning.

49:26.422 --> 49:31.551
He was awake when I left him.
Your old man's up there with him now.

49:31.969 --> 49:33.637
How you doing?

49:37.058 --> 49:39.559
You can't protect my father.

49:39.727 --> 49:42.562
We'll do the best we can.

49:42.730 --> 49:45.523
Those guys aren't afraid
of the police.

49:46.567 --> 49:49.194
If anything should happen to him...

49:53.032 --> 49:55.492
Listen, that thing
you were talking about...

49:55.660 --> 50:00.038
...if I wanted to help you,
what would I have to do?

50:04.877 --> 50:06.586
I'll call you.

50:12.927 --> 50:16.221
There's a wire in here.
We hear everything that goes down.

50:16.389 --> 50:20.100
We'd also have a tail on you,
so we'd be with you at all times.

50:20.768 --> 50:23.687
Small. Light as a feather.

50:25.481 --> 50:27.315
You're fucking kidding me. That's it?

50:27.483 --> 50:31.736
That's it. That's the risk.
You just gotta find that stash house.

50:31.904 --> 50:34.280
- This can't get out.
- Lt won't.

50:38.661 --> 50:41.079
Well, what if
something goes wrong?

50:43.249 --> 50:46.084
Give me a word.
First word comes to your mind.

50:48.796 --> 50:50.630
- Feather.
- Okay.

50:50.798 --> 50:54.467
Anytime we hear the word "feather,"
we come in early.

50:54.635 --> 50:58.138
Otherwise, stay there, do what you
gotta do and get the fuck out.

50:58.305 --> 51:01.933
- This will all be kept confidential.
- Yeah, it better.

51:03.894 --> 51:07.105
You get burnt, we have to
put you into protection.

51:07.273 --> 51:09.649
That's better than ending up dead.

51:12.069 --> 51:13.653
- Fuck.
- Listen...

51:13.821 --> 51:16.448
...nobody will ever know
you're involved.

51:16.615 --> 51:20.577
Not your father, not your girlfriend,
nobody.

51:20.745 --> 51:23.997
And maybe someday your brother
will thank you for all this.

51:24.165 --> 51:25.915
So, Bobby...

51:26.500 --> 51:29.335
...you call Vadim's people
and set it up.

51:29.503 --> 51:33.506
You won't see us, but we'll be
following your every move.

51:33.674 --> 51:37.010
Don't be a hero.
Don't make conversation.

51:37.470 --> 51:41.181
You sense they're onto you,
just remember the word is "feather."

51:41.474 --> 51:43.641
Your life is in that lighter.

51:44.185 --> 51:45.769
Good luck.

52:04.663 --> 52:07.207
Bobkes. Jesus.

52:07.374 --> 52:09.209
Where you been?
I left you a message.

52:09.376 --> 52:11.544
- Yeah, I got it. Thanks.
- You all right?

52:11.712 --> 52:13.338
- Yeah.
- What's the matter? You sick?

52:13.506 --> 52:15.381
Yeah, I've been out of it. I gotta--

52:15.549 --> 52:16.716
Come on, Amada's here.

52:16.967 --> 52:18.718
- Two Jack Daniels, please.
- No, no, no.

52:18.886 --> 52:22.388
I gotta take care of something.
I'll call you tomorrow.

52:22.556 --> 52:24.766
All right. Call me tomorrow.

52:39.448 --> 52:41.199
Please.

52:43.577 --> 52:45.703
See my friends out there?

52:48.207 --> 52:51.584
Vadim is really glad
that you made up your mind.

52:52.086 --> 52:54.128
He's very happy.

52:57.091 --> 52:58.633
You ready?

53:01.428 --> 53:02.846
Yeah.

53:04.807 --> 53:07.767
You'll meet me at the boardwalk
in one hour.

53:07.935 --> 53:09.602
For your protection, and for ours...

53:09.770 --> 53:13.022
...you'll be searched and blindfolded
as we arrive.

53:13.190 --> 53:15.567
You'll be able
to sample the product...

53:15.734 --> 53:18.736
...see if you like it. I'm sure you will.

53:18.904 --> 53:21.698
You will discuss the rest
of the details with Vadim.

53:21.866 --> 53:24.367
Don't raise your voice,
he doesn't like it.

53:25.953 --> 53:27.787
And for me...

53:29.623 --> 53:32.876
...l'm taking you to the place
where I never took anybody before...

53:33.043 --> 53:35.545
...especially no Americans.

53:36.547 --> 53:40.425
And I don't trust you
the way Vadim does.

53:40.926 --> 53:43.511
So don't.

53:43.888 --> 53:45.471
All right?

53:46.891 --> 53:50.393
And if you want to see
your girlfriend ever again...

53:50.561 --> 53:51.978
...you will come alone.

53:54.940 --> 53:58.067
Boardwalk. One hour.

54:57.002 --> 55:00.129
You don't mind
that I sit behind, do you?

55:00.881 --> 55:02.966
Do what you gotta do.

55:07.721 --> 55:09.806
Let me see your hands.

57:14.973 --> 57:17.934
Take this. Put it on.

58:57.868 --> 58:59.535
What do you think?

59:00.996 --> 59:02.622
Good.

59:04.499 --> 59:06.334
What do you got there?
How many keys?

59:06.501 --> 59:08.794
What, like three to four months?

59:08.962 --> 59:10.922
It's not gonna dry up on us, is it?

59:11.089 --> 59:13.883
We got a whole lot of stuff
coming in...

59:14.218 --> 59:16.427
...in a way nobody could ever trace.

59:25.896 --> 59:29.023
All the shit I got in here,
at least 86 percent pure.

59:29.191 --> 59:30.691
Sasha.

59:49.753 --> 59:51.921
The whole city will be
sucking our glass soon.

59:52.089 --> 59:54.674
We'll push the guineas out.
The Domos will work for us.

59:54.841 --> 59:56.342
It's good.

59:59.513 --> 01:00:01.555
So where's this coming from?

01:00:16.196 --> 01:00:18.281
You're breathing heavy.

01:00:19.366 --> 01:00:21.659
Yeah, because I just took a hit.

01:00:29.251 --> 01:00:32.128
You know, I seen fighters
breathe like that.

01:00:32.296 --> 01:00:34.422
It means they get nervous.

01:00:34.715 --> 01:00:37.550
- Are you nervous?
- No.

01:00:39.052 --> 01:00:41.012
I told you,
it's because I took some shit.

01:00:41.179 --> 01:00:43.222
What do I have
to be nervous about?

01:00:50.147 --> 01:00:51.731
They already searched me.

01:00:52.566 --> 01:00:54.900
I'm not here to fuck you.
What are you doing?

01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:21.385
How come you got both
matches and a lighter?

01:01:24.056 --> 01:01:27.141
I'm feeling light as a feather
from that shit.

01:01:32.647 --> 01:01:34.607
- What?
- Feeling light as a feather...

01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:36.776
...from that stuff.

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:49.246
- He's wired.
- No, wait.

01:01:49.915 --> 01:01:52.500
You were right.
Kill the motherfucker.

01:01:52.667 --> 01:01:54.960
Wait. Wait! Wait!

01:02:12.062 --> 01:02:13.896
Get up! Get over there!

01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:17.650
Take the roof. Bobby!

01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:26.075
Get the weapon!

01:02:29.996 --> 01:02:31.497
Go, go!

01:02:45.637 --> 01:02:48.139
- Police! Don't move!
- I'm with you! I'm with you!

01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:50.516
Don't move!

01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:03.112
Police! Don't move!

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:06.740
Put your hands up! Put your
hands up! Put your hands up!

01:03:06.908 --> 01:03:08.659
Back up to my voice!

01:03:11.079 --> 01:03:14.915
- Who is he? Ls he one of us?
- He's still breathing.

01:03:15.542 --> 01:03:17.001
Get him a stretcher, quick.

01:03:17.169 --> 01:03:20.045
Copy that, Rescue 238.
Patient is a Caucasian male...

01:03:20.213 --> 01:03:23.174
...mid-30s, with a leg fracture,
broken ribs, abrasions...

01:03:23.341 --> 01:03:25.050
...and a possible neck injury.

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:42.109
Where's Bobby? Where's my son?

01:03:42.277 --> 01:03:44.570
He's in the bus, chief.
They said he'll be okay.

01:03:44.738 --> 01:03:47.364
You guys call an operation
like this without telling me?

01:03:47.532 --> 01:03:49.241
You think I was born yesterday?

01:03:49.409 --> 01:03:51.243
- He came to me.
- He could've been killed!

01:03:51.411 --> 01:03:53.162
- Are you out of your mind?
- I'm sorry.

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:56.373
Well, my son's gotta go into
protection now. Thank you very much.

01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:57.958
- It was his idea.
- Where is he?

01:03:58.126 --> 01:04:00.586
I wanna see him. Is he all right?

01:04:01.755 --> 01:04:04.256
He's a dead man.

01:04:14.935 --> 01:04:16.936
You hear me, son?

01:04:21.608 --> 01:04:23.859
Crazy kid.

01:04:24.444 --> 01:04:26.362
Stupid kid.

01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:27.571
Pop...

01:04:28.532 --> 01:04:30.616
...my girlfriend.

01:04:31.535 --> 01:04:33.702
Call my girlfriend.

01:04:35.288 --> 01:04:37.373
Don't worry. I'll call her, all right?

01:04:37.541 --> 01:04:40.167
I'll let your brother know too.

01:04:40.961 --> 01:04:42.920
We gotta get you...

01:04:44.506 --> 01:04:46.799
Get you well again.

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:49.969
Things are gonna be different
for you now, Bobby.

01:04:50.136 --> 01:04:52.763
We're gonna
have to protect you now.

01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:06.777
1010 WINS. You give us 22 minutes,
we'll give you the world.

01:05:06.945 --> 01:05:10.197
This is Stan Brooks in Queens.
Police captain Joseph Grusinsky...

01:05:10.365 --> 01:05:12.783
...is leaving Jamaica Hospital
this afternoon.

01:05:12.951 --> 01:05:16.495
His doctors cleared him for release
following a four-month stay.

01:05:16.663 --> 01:05:19.665
The 11-year veteran was shot
in the face by a masked gunman...

01:05:19.833 --> 01:05:23.335
...outside his home
the night before Thanksgiving.

01:05:26.131 --> 01:05:28.090
Hey, big guys,
let's see what you got.

01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:30.593
Get out. Get lost.

01:05:32.345 --> 01:05:35.014
Everybody, I see the car.

01:05:37.058 --> 01:05:38.601
Here they are.

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:49.028
Welcome home, Joe.

01:05:51.031 --> 01:05:53.657
Welcome home. We love you.

01:05:53.825 --> 01:05:56.035
Hey, kiddo. You look great.

01:05:56.536 --> 01:05:58.746
- Welcome home.
- Hey, Bob.

01:06:00.832 --> 01:06:02.541
- L saw your guards out there.
- Daddy!

01:06:02.709 --> 01:06:05.210
- L didn't think they'd let you come.
- No, I wanted to.

01:06:05.378 --> 01:06:08.339
What's up? What's up, buddy?

01:06:08.506 --> 01:06:11.675
- Hey, how's your leg? You all right?
- Yeah. I'm glad you're home.

01:06:12.594 --> 01:06:14.219
Hey, we'll talk later, all right?

01:06:15.263 --> 01:06:18.015
Everyone, let's move inside.
There's plenty to eat.

01:06:18.183 --> 01:06:20.309
You gonna eat? Young lady. No?

01:06:25.482 --> 01:06:27.274
Stop it!

01:06:27.609 --> 01:06:29.401
Joe, you look just great.

01:06:30.278 --> 01:06:33.072
- Does it hurt at all?
- Yeah, a little, when I look at you.

01:06:33.239 --> 01:06:36.492
Oh, finally.
Finally he gets you back.

01:06:36.701 --> 01:06:38.994
Do you think maybe we could
go see my mom?

01:06:39.162 --> 01:06:42.748
No, honey, they made an exception
for this. I'm sorry, I don't think you can.

01:06:42.916 --> 01:06:44.416
Hey, Pop.

01:06:44.959 --> 01:06:47.753
You wanna go outside and
talk a little business on the porch?

01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:49.963
It's time you
brought me back up to speed.

01:06:50.131 --> 01:06:51.757
Whatever you say. Let's go.

01:06:52.050 --> 01:06:55.260
Bobby, come on, I want you
to hear this. It's for the trial.

01:06:55.428 --> 01:06:57.429
- All right.
- Baby, I wanna go.

01:06:57.597 --> 01:07:00.641
- No, stay here. I'll be 10 minutes, tops.
- Let me just go back.

01:07:00.809 --> 01:07:04.103
No. Just wait here. We'll go back
to the motel together.

01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:06.522
Hey, Sandra, these brownies
are really good.

01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:08.107
Careful.

01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:11.735
Nezhinski's cache was
even bigger than we thought.

01:07:12.153 --> 01:07:14.905
Forty kilos of yayo. Angel dust too.

01:07:15.073 --> 01:07:16.865
We gotta try to
make a deal with him...

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:19.034
...find out how they're bringing it in.

01:07:19.202 --> 01:07:21.120
He might not be too reliable, Pop.

01:07:21.287 --> 01:07:23.288
Hey, listen, you marry an ape...

01:07:23.456 --> 01:07:25.749
...you don't complain
about the stench of bananas.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.378
- Where is he now?
- At Rikers, tucked in nice and comfy.

01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:31.296
We take him
to the ADA's next week.

01:07:31.464 --> 01:07:34.383
Good, I wanna go with you on that.
I wanna see his fucking face.

01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:38.429
We gotta lean hard, get him to open
up. We got nowhere else to look.

01:07:38.596 --> 01:07:40.556
Well, what about his uncle?
Buzhayev?

01:07:40.724 --> 01:07:42.307
No, he's clean.

01:07:42.475 --> 01:07:45.102
We tapped his phone, tailed him.
We got nothing.

01:07:45.478 --> 01:07:46.937
Went to his fur store on Monday.

01:07:47.105 --> 01:07:49.773
Tuesday he took his grandkids
horseback riding.

01:07:49.941 --> 01:07:52.484
- Nothing there.
- I'll tell you, the streets are dead.

01:07:52.652 --> 01:07:56.238
The junkies are out there waiting
for something big, no question.

01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:58.991
Well, we got their number one.

01:07:59.159 --> 01:08:01.785
Gotta put the full-court press
on him, get him to fold.

01:08:01.953 --> 01:08:04.496
- It won't work.
- What?

01:08:07.792 --> 01:08:10.836
He won't trust you. These guys
think of you like you're a joke.

01:08:11.004 --> 01:08:13.797
They call you Mickey Mouse.
He's not gonna turn for you.

01:08:13.965 --> 01:08:17.301
Listen to the expert here. You don't
gotta get involved in this no more.

01:08:17.469 --> 01:08:20.345
I asked him to come in.
He's gotta know all this to testify.

01:08:20.513 --> 01:08:22.514
This is official police business, Pop.

01:08:22.682 --> 01:08:25.434
You gonna make him an honorary
member of the department?

01:08:25.602 --> 01:08:27.603
- What's the matter with you?
- He's right.

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:29.145
Didn't you hear what I said?

01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:33.317
I asked him to come in here.
I brought him in.

01:08:33.484 --> 01:08:36.694
Your brother's got a price on his head
and you talk to him like that?

01:08:41.701 --> 01:08:43.868
- Let's go.
- You have to wait for another car.

01:08:44.037 --> 01:08:47.331
Ms. Juarez just left.
She went to her mother's.

01:08:47.874 --> 01:08:49.166
- Bobby.
- What?

01:08:49.334 --> 01:08:51.667
What was said in there,
he didn't mean it.

01:08:51.836 --> 01:08:53.504
Ever since this thing happened...

01:08:53.671 --> 01:08:56.715
...he flies off the handle sometimes.
But, you know--

01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:59.259
Doctor says it may be part
of a stress disorder.

01:08:59.426 --> 01:09:02.261
- Needs a little more time to adjust.
- L understand that, Pop.

01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:05.640
I got my own shit to deal with.
I got a girlfriend that's pissed off.

01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:07.643
I just want this to be over with.

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:11.313
Listen to me. A lot of people been
talking about how good you did.

01:09:11.481 --> 01:09:15.234
Now, I think,
considering the alternatives...

01:09:15.944 --> 01:09:18.569
...maybe you ought to think
about going on the job.

01:09:19.072 --> 01:09:22.073
You got special knowledge.
The department likes that.

01:09:22.242 --> 01:09:23.492
I'm gonna go, Pop.

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:26.745
Why do you have to go?
Where you going?

01:09:32.085 --> 01:09:34.419
- Think fast.
- Hey.

01:09:36.673 --> 01:09:38.090
Hello.

01:09:40.718 --> 01:09:44.763
- When is she gonna marry me?
- That is my mother. That's gross.

01:09:52.981 --> 01:09:55.691
- Is it all clear? Good.
- Place is clear.

01:09:57.151 --> 01:10:00.070
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

01:10:04.158 --> 01:10:06.451
I'm sorry, but she can't be here
right now, okay?

01:10:06.619 --> 01:10:08.453
Baby, I was just finishing eating.

01:10:08.621 --> 01:10:12.541
Just get your stuff, let's go.
I'll be outside. I wanna talk to you.

01:10:25.305 --> 01:10:27.639
She can't do this, Jumbo.

01:10:27.807 --> 01:10:31.810
There are people out there trying
to kill me. Understand? It's dangerous.

01:10:31.978 --> 01:10:33.145
I-- I know.

01:10:33.354 --> 01:10:35.856
She called me. I got no idea
where you guys are.

01:10:36.024 --> 01:10:38.817
- Because no one can know.
- You all right?

01:10:42.322 --> 01:10:44.114
I miss you.

01:10:44.282 --> 01:10:45.657
Jeez, Bob.

01:10:45.825 --> 01:10:48.035
I'm stressed out.
Don't know what I'm doing.

01:10:48.202 --> 01:10:49.786
Me too.

01:10:49.954 --> 01:10:53.749
Hey, Bob, everyone's asking
about you at El Caribe.

01:10:54.042 --> 01:10:56.293
Freddie and all the girls...

01:10:56.461 --> 01:10:59.087
...and Mr. Buzhayev.
I mean, you were like a son to him.

01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:01.298
We were surprised
to hear about your family.

01:11:01.466 --> 01:11:04.343
Your father's like J. Edgar Hoover.

01:11:05.303 --> 01:11:07.262
I'm sorry I never said nothing.

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:09.556
Don't worry, Bob. It's all right.

01:11:09.724 --> 01:11:13.185
Listen, I gotta get her out of here,
and we'll call you.

01:11:13.519 --> 01:11:15.812
- Let's go.
- Okay.

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:18.357
We gotta move. Let's go.

01:11:25.657 --> 01:11:28.158
She misses me, Bobby.

01:11:29.661 --> 01:11:34.164
- You got to see your family.
- L know, baby, but that's different.

01:11:34.332 --> 01:11:35.540
How?

01:11:35.708 --> 01:11:38.293
Mike and Vitt,
they have a route planned.

01:11:38.586 --> 01:11:41.046
You can't just go
and jeopardize all this.

01:11:41.214 --> 01:11:43.507
Nobody can even know
what motel we're staying at.

01:11:43.675 --> 01:11:45.467
You gotta understand that.

01:11:45.885 --> 01:11:49.930
Listen, baby, Vadim's trial's
in two months.

01:11:50.098 --> 01:11:51.515
Two months.

01:11:55.728 --> 01:11:57.396
I'm sorry.

01:11:59.524 --> 01:12:03.360
It just feels like sometimes
the walls are closing in on me.

01:12:03.528 --> 01:12:05.779
It's gonna be okay.

01:12:18.876 --> 01:12:22.087
I'll go in the lead car. You stay
with him till we get to the A.D.A.

01:12:22.255 --> 01:12:25.257
Yeah. We got two cars.
One behind, one in front.

01:12:25.425 --> 01:12:28.719
If we make a deal with him, then
my brother don't have to testify.

01:12:28.886 --> 01:12:30.762
At least that's something.

01:12:33.933 --> 01:12:37.185
I'm here for an inmate pickup.
Vadim Nezhinski.

01:12:38.604 --> 01:12:40.689
- Is he ready?
- Yeah.

01:12:41.441 --> 01:12:43.066
They took him 20 minutes ago.

01:12:43.776 --> 01:12:46.028
- What?
- He complained of chest pains.

01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:48.321
They had to take him down
to Elmhurst Hospital.

01:12:48.489 --> 01:12:49.573
Elmhurst Hospital?

01:12:49.741 --> 01:12:52.451
Yeah, we had to do it.
It's the law.

01:12:54.245 --> 01:12:55.996
Give me the phone.

01:12:57.331 --> 01:12:58.999
You deaf?
Give me the fucking phone!

01:12:59.167 --> 01:13:00.625
Hey, what's wrong with you?

01:13:02.295 --> 01:13:04.379
Thanks for being here.

01:13:06.132 --> 01:13:09.176
I know it's been really hard.

01:13:15.558 --> 01:13:17.142
Yeah.

01:13:18.144 --> 01:13:22.105
Bobby, your brother just called.
We have an emergency.

01:13:22.273 --> 01:13:25.650
Nezhinski's out. So get your stuff
together, we're moving you.

01:13:25.818 --> 01:13:27.319
- What?
- He escaped.

01:13:27.487 --> 01:13:29.905
They took him to the hospital
with chest pains. He--

01:13:30.073 --> 01:13:33.492
He had cooperation from the outside.
Our guys got ambushed.

01:13:35.036 --> 01:13:37.120
Start packing up, sweetheart.
Let's go.

01:13:37.288 --> 01:13:41.416
Somebody might know this location.
We better get you moved.

01:13:42.043 --> 01:13:45.378
I'll meet you outside, all right?
Let's go.

01:13:58.184 --> 01:14:00.685
The backup should be here
any minute.

01:14:00.853 --> 01:14:03.271
Probably got held up in the rain.

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.441
You all right?

01:14:10.154 --> 01:14:14.825
- Pop, I'm fucked.
- No, you're not. You'll be okay.

01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:21.706
You're never gonna get Nezhinski.

01:14:22.208 --> 01:14:23.959
Me and Amada
can't take this anymore.

01:14:24.127 --> 01:14:27.504
- Bobby.
- L don't know what to do.

01:14:28.714 --> 01:14:30.715
I'm gonna protect you, all right?

01:14:32.093 --> 01:14:34.219
I'll make you a promise right now.

01:14:34.929 --> 01:14:37.055
I'm gonna protect you.

01:14:38.224 --> 01:14:39.641
Don't worry.

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:46.481
It's gonna be okay, son.
We'll see it through.

01:14:49.902 --> 01:14:50.986
- Chief?
- Yeah.

01:14:51.154 --> 01:14:53.613
- We have three vehicles on the way.
- Okay.

01:14:53.781 --> 01:14:55.073
We'll move them to Corona.

01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:56.658
I'll lead the line.

01:14:57.952 --> 01:15:00.162
- Let's go, son.
- Honey.

01:15:00.329 --> 01:15:02.998
You guys stay close behind my car.

01:15:17.513 --> 01:15:20.432
There's flooding up ahead.
Watch my brake lights.

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:23.977
It's really coming down.

01:15:26.522 --> 01:15:29.316
Vitt, where's the car that's
supposed to be following us?

01:15:29.483 --> 01:15:31.902
He should be right behind us,
Bobby.

01:15:32.904 --> 01:15:35.864
Shit, I left the watch you gave me
at the hotel.

01:15:36.324 --> 01:15:38.283
Is that it on the right?

01:15:40.703 --> 01:15:42.621
- Vitt!
- Oh, my God!

01:15:42.788 --> 01:15:44.414
Amada, get down! Get down!

01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:49.586
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Motherfucker!

01:15:49.754 --> 01:15:51.463
Oh, my God!

01:15:51.631 --> 01:15:54.633
What the fuck?!
How'd they find us?

01:15:55.468 --> 01:15:58.428
- Amada, stay down!
- Get off, they're shooting.

01:15:59.138 --> 01:16:00.972
Get off the road!

01:16:01.891 --> 01:16:03.058
Fuck.

01:16:08.564 --> 01:16:10.273
Fuck!

01:16:10.441 --> 01:16:14.444
Get off! Now! I'll take care of them!

01:16:32.255 --> 01:16:35.966
Get off the road, Bobby!
Get off the road! Get off!

01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:40.637
You hit? Amada, are you hit?
You hit?

01:16:40.805 --> 01:16:43.974
- No! No!
- You hit?

01:16:53.359 --> 01:16:55.026
Jesus.

01:17:15.214 --> 01:17:17.173
Pop, pull over!

01:17:17.591 --> 01:17:19.843
Pull over! Pull over!

01:18:51.894 --> 01:18:55.688
You're in a suite at the Sheraton
near Kennedy Airport.

01:18:55.856 --> 01:18:58.024
Your brother is here for you.

01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:25.176
I wanted to let you sleep a little bit.

01:19:25.344 --> 01:19:27.053
Where's Pop?

01:19:28.722 --> 01:19:30.515
I had to go and identify the body.

01:19:39.525 --> 01:19:42.819
I saw him die.

01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:46.448
It's all right.
It's gonna be okay, all right?

01:19:46.615 --> 01:19:49.200
- L don't wanna be alone.
- L know.

01:19:49.702 --> 01:19:51.411
I'm here.

01:19:51.871 --> 01:19:53.371
Now, don't worry, all right?

01:19:53.539 --> 01:19:56.541
I'll be ready to come back and
head things up, and we'll get him.

01:19:57.084 --> 01:20:01.129
You just wait till after the funeral.
They're gonna get Nezhinski.

01:20:01.297 --> 01:20:03.548
- How did they know where we were?
- It's all right.

01:20:04.049 --> 01:20:06.342
How'd they find us?

01:21:06.111 --> 01:21:08.154
Your father was a great man.

01:21:08.322 --> 01:21:09.948
Thank you.

01:21:11.283 --> 01:21:13.952
He gave me his combat ribbon...

01:21:14.119 --> 01:21:16.704
...after we got back from Korea.

01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:21.167
I was gonna put it in with him...

01:21:21.335 --> 01:21:24.629
...but I think he would have wanted
you to have it now.

01:21:25.172 --> 01:21:26.965
Thanks.

01:21:27.383 --> 01:21:29.425
It's now in your hands...

01:21:29.593 --> 01:21:31.803
...but we're gonna help you
get Nezhinski.

01:21:32.137 --> 01:21:33.972
And we got a lead, Joe.

01:21:34.139 --> 01:21:35.932
Word got back
from one of our uncles...

01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:39.394
...that a big Russian shipment's
coming in sometime next week.

01:21:39.562 --> 01:21:41.312
We'll find it.

01:21:41.981 --> 01:21:44.816
Your father will not
have died in vain.

01:22:01.333 --> 01:22:03.835
You're not sleeping again.

01:22:05.546 --> 01:22:08.339
Did you take the pills
the doctor gave you?

01:22:09.091 --> 01:22:10.800
No.

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:17.265
What is this?

01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:30.653
Is this a police exam?

01:22:34.867 --> 01:22:38.328
Bobby, is this a police exam?

01:22:39.246 --> 01:22:41.039
Yes.

01:22:47.463 --> 01:22:49.213
Were you gonna talk to me
about it?

01:22:50.299 --> 01:22:51.799
Yeah.

01:22:52.426 --> 01:22:54.177
When?

01:22:55.179 --> 01:22:56.888
I don't know.

01:23:00.559 --> 01:23:03.895
Bobby, do you know
how this makes me feel?

01:23:04.563 --> 01:23:08.775
You just went off,
you made this decision.

01:23:13.238 --> 01:23:16.157
You didn't even talk to me about it.

01:23:18.452 --> 01:23:21.913
After this nightmare
we've been through?

01:23:22.081 --> 01:23:25.166
I don't know if I could
live through that again.

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:30.922
You're gonna join
the police, Bobby?

01:23:31.465 --> 01:23:35.009
Baby, you could be killed.
Look at your brother.

01:23:35.177 --> 01:23:37.095
Your father, he died for nothing.

01:23:37.262 --> 01:23:39.305
No! No!

01:23:39.473 --> 01:23:42.225
Don't talk about them!
You don't talk about them!

01:23:42.393 --> 01:23:45.019
- You wanna get shot like him?
- Don't talk about them!

01:23:45.771 --> 01:23:48.564
Do not talk about them!
You don't understand!

01:23:50.150 --> 01:23:53.111
You can't do this!
I won't let you!

01:23:53.278 --> 01:23:55.279
- No, you can't!
- L have to do this!

01:23:55.447 --> 01:23:57.573
- No, you don't!
- L have to do it!

01:23:57.741 --> 01:24:00.451
No, you're gonna get yourself killed!

01:24:00.619 --> 01:24:02.412
I fucking hate you!

01:24:16.301 --> 01:24:19.387
The commissioner's aware you have
special knowledge for this case.

01:24:20.347 --> 01:24:22.724
He made it top priority.

01:24:22.891 --> 01:24:24.350
Come.

01:24:29.314 --> 01:24:31.649
We're all very sorry
about your father, Robert.

01:24:31.817 --> 01:24:34.986
- Thank you.
- Pursuant to your request...

01:24:35.154 --> 01:24:37.864
...we've decided to grant you
a special dispensation...

01:24:38.031 --> 01:24:39.991
...and appoint you
a conditional member...

01:24:40.159 --> 01:24:42.577
...of this department,
effective immediately.

01:24:42.745 --> 01:24:44.996
- L appreciate that.
- Good.

01:24:45.164 --> 01:24:49.125
You will be required to go to the
academy once this case is completed.

01:24:49.918 --> 01:24:51.961
- You know that?
- Yes, I do.

01:24:52.337 --> 01:24:53.671
All right, then.

01:24:53.839 --> 01:24:56.924
Would you raise
your right hand, please?

01:24:57.593 --> 01:25:00.803
"I, Robert Green,
hereby pledge and declare...

01:25:00.971 --> 01:25:03.973
...that I will support and defend
the Constitution--".

01:25:04.433 --> 01:25:07.685
I, Robert Green,
hereby pledge and declare...

01:25:07.853 --> 01:25:10.646
...that I will support and defend
the Constitution--

01:25:10.814 --> 01:25:12.690
"--both of
the United States government...

01:25:12.858 --> 01:25:15.526
...and the state of New York,
to the best of my ability."

01:25:15.694 --> 01:25:17.528
--both of
the United States government...

01:25:17.696 --> 01:25:20.865
...and the state of New York,
to the best of my ability.

01:25:21.033 --> 01:25:25.661
"I will faithfully discharge my duties
in the rank of probationary officer--"

01:25:25.829 --> 01:25:30.291
I will faithfully discharge my duties
in the rank of probationary officer--

01:25:30.459 --> 01:25:32.502
"--in the New York City
Police Department."

01:25:32.669 --> 01:25:34.670
--in the New York City
Police Department.

01:25:34.838 --> 01:25:38.382
- "So help me God."
- So help me God.

01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:41.135
Congratulations, Robert,
and welcome.

01:25:41.303 --> 01:25:42.345
Thank you.

01:25:42.513 --> 01:25:44.222
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:25:44.389 --> 01:25:46.641
They're all expecting you
down at the precinct.

01:25:46.809 --> 01:25:51.729
Work all your contacts. We gotta find
out where that deal is going down.

01:25:52.064 --> 01:25:54.816
Jumbo, I'm not gonna party,
but I need to talk to you.

01:25:55.734 --> 01:25:59.403
All right, so, look, I'll come down later
and I'll see you there. All right.

01:25:59.655 --> 01:26:01.739
No, don't tell Freddie.

01:26:01.907 --> 01:26:03.574
Jumbo, listen to me.

01:26:03.742 --> 01:26:07.036
Just meet me at El Caribe
at 11:30, all right?

01:26:07.204 --> 01:26:08.746
All right.

01:26:09.331 --> 01:26:10.790
Hey.

01:26:11.708 --> 01:26:13.459
You get your lD card this morning?

01:26:13.627 --> 01:26:17.338
Yeah, but they wouldn't give me
a piece. I should have one.

01:26:17.881 --> 01:26:19.757
I'll get you one.

01:26:21.385 --> 01:26:24.178
Pop always said
you were a good shot.

01:26:28.433 --> 01:26:31.602
- What's the matter, Joe?
- Nothing.

01:26:32.271 --> 01:26:34.605
It's kind of weird seeing you here.

01:26:37.734 --> 01:26:40.486
- Yeah, I know.
- Bobby.

01:26:41.738 --> 01:26:44.782
I never meant
to get you involved in all this.

01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:46.367
I'm sorry.

01:26:46.535 --> 01:26:49.453
You don't gotta apologize to me.

01:26:50.455 --> 01:26:53.332
I never listened to you or Pop.

01:26:55.377 --> 01:26:57.086
You wanna hear something funny?

01:26:57.546 --> 01:26:59.964
I was kind ofjealous of you for that.

01:27:02.134 --> 01:27:04.760
I was. I don't think
I had a lot of faith in myself.

01:27:04.928 --> 01:27:07.179
I just did what Pop wanted me to do.

01:27:07.973 --> 01:27:11.642
I mean, you...
I mean, you were free.

01:27:15.022 --> 01:27:17.064
Anyway, look...

01:27:17.232 --> 01:27:19.775
...l didn't mean to get into all this.
It just...

01:27:20.861 --> 01:27:23.654
Maybe it's just because
I ain't been sleeping lately.

01:27:23.822 --> 01:27:27.074
I'm kind of having some nightmares
about what happened to me.

01:27:29.411 --> 01:27:30.953
Well...

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.920
...all that matters
is that we finish this.

01:27:39.671 --> 01:27:42.840
And we catch Nezhinski
when that deal goes down.

01:27:43.008 --> 01:27:46.260
Bobby, an Amada Juarez
is calling for you on line three.

01:27:46.929 --> 01:27:49.263
- Tell her I'll call her back later.
- All right.

01:27:50.974 --> 01:27:53.017
Are you gonna be okay?

01:27:55.604 --> 01:27:59.148
I gotta go downstairs and
get fitted for a vest, all right?

01:27:59.316 --> 01:28:00.858
Yeah.

01:28:22.047 --> 01:28:23.839
Amada?

01:28:25.217 --> 01:28:26.550
Hey.

01:28:27.094 --> 01:28:30.012
Miss Juarez left about an hour ago.

01:28:30.222 --> 01:28:32.264
She said to give you this.

01:28:38.230 --> 01:28:41.065
- Hey, get me some food, would you?
- Yeah, sure.

01:28:41.233 --> 01:28:44.402
We're checking you out at noon
tomorrow. Get your stuff together.

01:28:44.569 --> 01:28:46.570
I'll bring the menus.

01:29:29.364 --> 01:29:30.781
Lou.

01:29:30.949 --> 01:29:33.743
My brother. The grand return.

01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:37.413
I can't believe you called. Look at you.
You look great. You look different.

01:29:37.789 --> 01:29:39.582
- Who is this?
- That's my bodyguard.

01:29:39.875 --> 01:29:42.793
Look at this place.
You put more tables up here?

01:29:42.961 --> 01:29:46.005
No. I don't know. Come here.
Come on, have a drink for a second.

01:29:46.173 --> 01:29:49.633
- Why don't you get us some drinks?
- Don't you think you've had enough?

01:29:49.801 --> 01:29:53.220
You wanna be a pain in my ass?
You my mother? Get us some drinks.

01:29:53.388 --> 01:29:56.265
- Fuck you in the ass.
- I'm ready.

01:29:56.433 --> 01:29:59.477
- L wanna talk to you about something.
- Sure.

01:30:01.104 --> 01:30:04.398
You know of anything going down
the next few days? Something major?

01:30:05.901 --> 01:30:06.984
No.

01:30:07.152 --> 01:30:10.321
I mean, they never tell me
their heavy stuff anyway.

01:30:10.489 --> 01:30:13.908
Yeah, but you hear about things.
People talking, anything?

01:30:15.786 --> 01:30:18.287
If I hear anything, I'll let you know.

01:30:19.498 --> 01:30:22.166
- What about Freddie? He around?
- Freddie's downstairs.

01:30:22.334 --> 01:30:24.668
- Come on, pay attention.
- Where's Amada?

01:30:27.547 --> 01:30:29.131
Bob.

01:30:29.299 --> 01:30:31.634
- She left.
- She left?

01:30:32.511 --> 01:30:35.012
- What do you mean, she left?
- Jumbo, leave it alone.

01:30:35.180 --> 01:30:36.889
Don't worry. Don't worry.

01:30:37.057 --> 01:30:40.017
Amada, she probably
just needs some space.

01:30:40.602 --> 01:30:42.186
She'll be back.

01:30:42.354 --> 01:30:45.356
Between us, that place they
had you in was driving her crazy...

01:30:45.524 --> 01:30:47.900
...l know that.
The Cue Motor Inn?

01:30:48.068 --> 01:30:51.112
We used to call it the "Screw Motor
Inn," with all the hookers.

01:30:53.615 --> 01:30:55.866
How'd you know
where we were staying?

01:31:01.123 --> 01:31:03.582
How did you know
where we were staying?

01:31:06.378 --> 01:31:08.546
It was in the papers.

01:31:09.047 --> 01:31:11.882
You know, those reporters,
they got their noses everywhere.

01:31:12.050 --> 01:31:14.385
Always looking through
everybody's garbage.

01:31:14.553 --> 01:31:17.513
Anyway, homeslice,
what do you think of the floorshow?

01:31:17.681 --> 01:31:21.058
Wanna go downstairs for a bit?
Go outside? It's loud in here.

01:31:21.226 --> 01:31:23.519
- What?
- Talk, catch up?

01:31:25.063 --> 01:31:27.148
You wanna go outside?
We got drinks coming.

01:31:27.315 --> 01:31:30.151
Forget the drinks. I haven't
seen you in forever. Let's go.

01:31:30.318 --> 01:31:32.611
- It's cold out.
- Get your coat.

01:31:32.779 --> 01:31:35.239
Come on. Give us a few minutes.
It'll be all right.

01:31:35.407 --> 01:31:37.616
Okay, but make it quick.

01:31:55.302 --> 01:31:57.803
It wasn't in the papers, Lou.

01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:08.314
Where's Nezhinski?

01:32:08.481 --> 01:32:10.232
I don't know.

01:32:11.401 --> 01:32:13.319
Don't play games with me.

01:32:13.486 --> 01:32:18.240
- L don't know.
- L said, don't play games with me.

01:32:22.078 --> 01:32:25.247
Amada told you where
we were staying, didn't she?

01:32:26.458 --> 01:32:28.709
She trusted you like a brother.

01:32:28.877 --> 01:32:31.128
Bob. Come on.

01:32:33.006 --> 01:32:34.798
I swear, I don't know nothing.

01:32:41.348 --> 01:32:44.141
My father's dead because of you.

01:32:45.310 --> 01:32:47.603
You know I'm with the police now?

01:32:48.146 --> 01:32:51.315
And I can do anything to you.

01:32:51.483 --> 01:32:55.527
Bob, I told them where you were,
but it ain't what you think.

01:32:55.695 --> 01:32:57.738
Amada said you moved
every couple days.

01:32:57.906 --> 01:33:01.408
I thought you'd be gone by then.
It's the truth. I sw--

01:33:01.576 --> 01:33:02.993
I swear to God.

01:33:03.453 --> 01:33:06.997
I tried to give them
the wrong information. I tried.

01:33:07.165 --> 01:33:10.251
Come on. Tell me who.

01:33:10.835 --> 01:33:13.545
Who? Who? Who?

01:33:16.925 --> 01:33:18.550
Marat.

01:33:18.718 --> 01:33:21.011
Marat Buzhayev.

01:33:21.471 --> 01:33:25.474
I'm sorry, Bob. I know
he was like a father to you...

01:33:26.393 --> 01:33:27.643
...but he owns me.

01:33:27.811 --> 01:33:32.189
Don't say that! Don't say that!
Don't say that!

01:33:32.524 --> 01:33:35.192
- My eyes.
- You fuck!

01:33:35.652 --> 01:33:39.780
You fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

01:33:39.948 --> 01:33:42.199
You fuck!

01:33:45.829 --> 01:33:47.538
Get up. Get up!

01:33:49.291 --> 01:33:52.543
Get up! Get up!

01:33:54.421 --> 01:33:56.297
This Jumbo Falsetti guy
confirmed...

01:33:56.464 --> 01:34:00.551
...that a major shipment
is coming tomorrow for Buzhayev.

01:34:01.136 --> 01:34:04.972
He says Buzhayev uses
his grandkids as couriers.

01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:08.559
They go everywhere for him. That's
why we weren't able to catch him.

01:34:08.727 --> 01:34:11.729
We should've been putting a tail
on a couple of 10-year-olds.

01:34:11.896 --> 01:34:14.356
It's unbelievable.
Did Jumbo know the location?

01:34:14.524 --> 01:34:18.193
No. No, we tried, believe me.
We interrogated him all night.

01:34:18.486 --> 01:34:20.154
He was crying like a 4-year-old.

01:34:20.322 --> 01:34:24.199
But he did say he thought
Nezhinski would be there, though.

01:34:24.367 --> 01:34:26.702
Tomorrow's Tuesday, right?

01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:30.414
Buzhayev takes his grandkids to
Floyd Bennett Field every Tuesday.

01:34:30.582 --> 01:34:32.916
He takes them horseback riding.

01:34:33.084 --> 01:34:35.878
Joe, we should
put our money on that.

01:34:36.296 --> 01:34:39.757
- No, that's not really much to go on.
- You got a better idea?

01:34:39.924 --> 01:34:42.217
Anyone?
We can sit on our fucking asses...

01:34:42.385 --> 01:34:44.511
- ...or we can crush these--
- Bobby.

01:34:45.055 --> 01:34:47.473
It's a process, you know?

01:34:47.807 --> 01:34:52.394
Look, that's what we got.
I guess that's what we should go with.

01:34:53.897 --> 01:34:55.689
You heard him. Let's go.

01:34:57.317 --> 01:34:59.151
Coats are on the porch.

01:34:59.319 --> 01:35:02.071
Contact ESU. Make sure we don't
come up short, all right?

01:35:02.238 --> 01:35:03.906
We got it covered.

01:35:04.074 --> 01:35:06.283
- Sorry about the mess, Sandra.
- It's all right.

01:35:06.451 --> 01:35:09.745
Joe, you know, they're laughing at us
out there on the street.

01:35:09.913 --> 01:35:12.498
Now, when we get there,
what we do will be up to you.

01:35:12.665 --> 01:35:15.292
But I hope
you drop the hammer on them.

01:35:17.003 --> 01:35:19.129
After your father
and everything else?

01:35:19.381 --> 01:35:22.633
I mean, these people
are like fucking lice.

01:35:23.385 --> 01:35:26.387
Just think about
what I'm saying to you.

01:35:29.474 --> 01:35:31.100
Joe.

01:35:31.810 --> 01:35:33.894
Joe, you okay?

01:35:36.147 --> 01:35:38.023
I hear you, GQ.

01:35:51.037 --> 01:35:54.456
Take that, all right?
It's one of Pop's.

01:35:58.002 --> 01:36:01.213
I don't need any more guns in my life,
that's for sure.

01:36:01.381 --> 01:36:03.841
But you should have one to be safe.

01:36:04.843 --> 01:36:08.387
It's better to be judged by 12
than carried by six.

01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:44.608
Joe, we're all ready.
What's the move?

01:37:44.776 --> 01:37:46.568
Wait till they complete the sale.

01:37:46.736 --> 01:37:48.904
Then we move.
ESU will grab the kids.

01:37:53.785 --> 01:37:56.620
They're so fucking close,
the two of them.

01:38:34.242 --> 01:38:37.160
This is what
we've wanted for so long.

01:38:37.328 --> 01:38:41.915
My nephew has stayed
just to see this through.

01:38:43.918 --> 01:38:46.211
When this is done...

01:38:46.629 --> 01:38:49.339
...we'll control
almost the whole market.

01:38:51.259 --> 01:38:53.760
Each load is completely untraceable.

01:38:57.307 --> 01:39:00.183
It's my own method.

01:39:01.811 --> 01:39:02.853
Impressive.

01:39:03.563 --> 01:39:08.275
You put the drugs right on the coat.

01:39:08.610 --> 01:39:12.029
We are importing 200 imitation sables
per week.

01:39:41.184 --> 01:39:43.060
Try it.

01:39:50.109 --> 01:39:52.194
Very good. Give them the money.

01:39:54.530 --> 01:39:58.241
All right, deal's about to close.
Let's go.

01:39:58.409 --> 01:40:01.328
This is the police! Drop your weapons.
Come out!

01:40:01.496 --> 01:40:03.038
Police! Put your weapons down!

01:40:03.373 --> 01:40:05.082
They're firing at us.
Everybody down!

01:40:05.333 --> 01:40:07.125
Eli! The kids!

01:40:12.131 --> 01:40:15.050
Get down! Joseph! Get down!

01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:18.553
Joe! Joe, are you hit?

01:40:19.013 --> 01:40:21.890
- What happened?
- He's okay. He's okay.

01:40:23.309 --> 01:40:25.018
He's all right. He ain't hit.

01:40:25.186 --> 01:40:27.562
- Should we move?
- L don't know what's wrong.

01:40:27.730 --> 01:40:29.898
- Bobby. Bobby, take his shotgun.
- Okay.

01:40:30.066 --> 01:40:32.275
- I'll stay here with him.
- Go, go, go!

01:40:44.038 --> 01:40:45.330
Run!

01:40:45.498 --> 01:40:47.416
We got runners out the back!

01:40:54.757 --> 01:40:57.217
- It's okay.
- Come with me.

01:40:57.385 --> 01:40:58.427
Keep going! Go! Go!

01:40:58.594 --> 01:40:59.928
- Watch your back!
- Go! Go!

01:41:00.096 --> 01:41:02.347
Kelly, we're gonna move to the left!
Let's go.

01:41:02.515 --> 01:41:03.932
Okay.

01:41:09.605 --> 01:41:11.773
Halt! Police!

01:42:01.449 --> 01:42:03.950
Freeze. Hold it right there.

01:42:29.519 --> 01:42:32.437
All right. Fuck!

01:42:34.315 --> 01:42:36.775
We'll kill each other in here.

01:42:36.943 --> 01:42:38.944
Nezhinski's in here with us.

01:42:39.111 --> 01:42:41.238
Let's smoke him out.

01:42:41.405 --> 01:42:44.074
Radio our guys.
Tell them to clear out.

01:42:44.242 --> 01:42:45.951
Absolutely.

01:42:47.036 --> 01:42:50.038
We got the old man.
We got Buzhayev.

01:42:50.206 --> 01:42:52.833
All right, guys. Clear out.

01:42:53.918 --> 01:42:56.253
Go on. Into the clearing.

01:43:33.291 --> 01:43:35.417
Bobby!

01:43:35.585 --> 01:43:37.586
Bobby, what are you doing?

01:43:39.046 --> 01:43:40.463
Bobby!

01:43:42.174 --> 01:43:45.343
Don't go in there.
We have Vadim surrounded.

01:43:45.511 --> 01:43:49.431
Be patient, he'll come out! Bobby!

01:43:53.811 --> 01:43:59.983
Bobby!

01:44:46.322 --> 01:44:47.989
Bobby...

01:44:49.367 --> 01:44:51.201
...fuck you.

01:45:58.602 --> 01:46:00.645
Bobby...

01:46:00.813 --> 01:46:03.898
...l didn't know
it would be your family.

01:46:06.819 --> 01:46:09.070
Get on your knees.

01:46:32.136 --> 01:46:33.803
We're done here.

01:47:40.788 --> 01:47:41.830
Hey, Joe.

01:47:41.997 --> 01:47:43.832
- Can't believe how nervous I am.
- Bobby.

01:47:43.999 --> 01:47:45.208
- Big day.
- Look at you.

01:47:45.376 --> 01:47:48.128
All dressed up, huh?
Looking like a chief.

01:47:48.295 --> 01:47:50.547
I don't know about that.
Maybe a lieutenant.

01:47:50.714 --> 01:47:52.382
- You look good.
- Captain?

01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:55.135
Hey, Joe, I got through
to McClennan at Personnel.

01:47:55.302 --> 01:47:57.137
He's still holding that slot for you...

01:47:57.304 --> 01:47:59.848
...if you're ready
to switch to administration.

01:48:00.015 --> 01:48:02.142
Yeah, can we talk about it
another time?

01:48:02.935 --> 01:48:04.018
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

01:48:04.353 --> 01:48:07.230
- Hey, good luck.
- All right.

01:48:07.773 --> 01:48:09.649
Now, what's this?

01:48:11.026 --> 01:48:13.778
Look, I meant to tell you.

01:48:14.155 --> 01:48:17.782
I gotta start doing the right thing.
I gotta spend more time at home.

01:48:17.950 --> 01:48:20.201
I got three kids now.
What am I supposed to do?

01:48:20.911 --> 01:48:23.788
Look, I was gonna
talk to you about it.

01:48:24.748 --> 01:48:27.041
Do what you need to do.

01:48:27.751 --> 01:48:31.004
They're gonna get started.
We should probably go in. Come on.

01:48:33.966 --> 01:48:35.633
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:48:35.801 --> 01:48:39.846
...we shall begin today's ceremony
with the traditional invocation...

01:48:40.014 --> 01:48:42.348
...moving then
to the valedictorian address...

01:48:42.516 --> 01:48:45.268
...to be given by Robert Grusinsky...

01:48:45.936 --> 01:48:49.564
...son of the late
Deputy Chief Albert Grusinsky...

01:48:49.732 --> 01:48:52.734
...brother of
Captain Joseph Grusinsky.

01:48:53.235 --> 01:48:56.779
You know, as I look at that fine
young man seated behind me...

01:48:57.531 --> 01:49:01.284
...l can't help but think of all the
young members of our department.

01:49:01.994 --> 01:49:04.621
I get filled with such pride.

01:49:04.788 --> 01:49:09.626
Men like him
are the future of the force.

01:49:09.793 --> 01:49:13.755
Let us remind ourselves
we are in God's presence.

01:49:13.923 --> 01:49:15.924
Let us pray.

01:49:17.509 --> 01:49:20.303
O God, we come together
at this most joyous occasion...

01:49:20.471 --> 01:49:24.557
...the New York City Police
graduation ceremony.

01:49:24.892 --> 01:49:29.062
We ask you to guide, bless and
protect those who are graduating.

01:49:30.314 --> 01:49:34.067
Please bless their families and friends
who gather and share their joy.

01:49:34.235 --> 01:49:36.986
- L love you very much.
- Strengthen us, our Lord...

01:49:37.154 --> 01:49:39.656
- ...now and forever. Amen.
- L love you too.

01:49:39.823 --> 01:49:42.075
Amen.
