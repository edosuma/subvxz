00:07.667 --> 00:10.133
NARRATOR: On this episode
of Life Below Zero...

00:10.167 --> 00:12.167
Alaskans prepare to battle
the darkness.

00:12.200 --> 00:15.033
GLENN: The darkest, coldest
part of the winter
is just ahead.

00:15.067 --> 00:17.933
NARRATOR: Glenn's quest for
heat leads him down a
treacherous path.

00:18.233 --> 00:19.600
Whoa!

00:19.633 --> 00:22.800
NARRATOR: A wandering cub puts
Andy and Kate on high alert.

00:22.833 --> 00:24.933
No sign of mother or
anything.

00:24.967 --> 00:27.867
NARRATOR: The bitter cold
threatens
the Hailstone's survival.

00:27.900 --> 00:29.833
With cold days like this,
things break.

00:29.867 --> 00:32.367
NARRATOR: And a winter
punch knocks
Sue's lights out.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.233
SUE: My generator just
went down.

00:34.267 --> 00:36.500
Other than the light on
my head, there's no
lights in camp.

00:52.467 --> 00:55.367
Gee! Good girl.

00:56.733 --> 00:59.267
Straight ahead.
Whoa.

00:59.300 --> 01:00.967
Good.
Good girl, Topaz.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.900
Hello. Have I got a
surprise for you.

01:03.933 --> 01:06.733
-What's up?
-There's a bear in the
fish rack.

01:06.767 --> 01:09.767
I don't think it's very big,
but I saw the tail end of it.

01:09.800 --> 01:11.767
So we might want to
go check it...

01:11.800 --> 01:13.567
Is the, is the fish rack
ripped apart anywhere?

01:13.600 --> 01:15.900
-No. I don't think
it's big.
-Okay.

01:15.933 --> 01:17.067
I think it's quite small.

01:17.100 --> 01:20.767
So I think we should just
go take a look.

01:20.800 --> 01:24.333
All right, let's get these
dogs put up and then
I'll, I'll go check it out.

01:25.733 --> 01:28.367
NARRATOR: As a predator
of the arctic,

01:28.400 --> 01:31.800
a bear in camp poses a
threat not only to
the dog team,

01:31.833 --> 01:33.700
but to their vital
supply of fish.

01:38.367 --> 01:41.800
Kate told me there's a
little bear hanging out
under our fish rack.

01:41.833 --> 01:44.767
So I'm gonna go down
and assess the situation.

01:58.833 --> 02:00.533
Oh, there he is.

02:02.200 --> 02:04.067
What are you doing?

02:04.100 --> 02:07.600
You look way too young to be
hanging out by yourself.

02:07.633 --> 02:09.967
I've never heard of bears
being out this time of year

02:10.000 --> 02:12.067
except for maybe
a grizzly bear.

02:12.100 --> 02:14.733
Black bears, they're usually
well in their dens by now.

02:14.767 --> 02:17.500
So this is a first for Calico.

02:17.533 --> 02:20.433
But a young bear like this
would never survive a
winter on his own.

02:20.467 --> 02:22.600
There's no way he can hunt
anything on his own.

02:22.633 --> 02:23.933
That's why he's under
the fish rack.

02:23.967 --> 02:26.767
His nose picked up the scent
of all this warm weather fish.

02:28.500 --> 02:31.433
I think if mom was around,
she'd already have been
around here.

02:31.467 --> 02:33.800
And there's no tracks
around here.

02:33.833 --> 02:37.500
If he was worried about mom,
he'd be bawling like a baby.

02:37.533 --> 02:40.200
They sound like a lamb
bawling when they're
distressed.

02:40.233 --> 02:41.500
I don't want him under
the rack.

02:41.533 --> 02:44.500
I have to get in and
out of this rack
to get dog food.

02:44.533 --> 02:46.833
I don't want dogs coming in
and trying to kill him.

02:46.867 --> 02:49.600
Or, worse yet, getting bit up
or chewed up by him.

02:49.633 --> 02:51.567
If I can get a tranquiliser
into him,

02:51.600 --> 02:54.867
we can put him into a
secured box and feed him,

02:54.900 --> 02:57.833
and he'll be just as content
in that as he is
under the fish rack.

02:59.600 --> 03:02.233
All right, thank you.
Bye-bye.

03:02.267 --> 03:04.800
I was calling the Department
of Fish and Game

03:04.833 --> 03:07.367
to see if we can get a rescue
for this little critter.

03:10.567 --> 03:12.233
CHIP: We don't like doing
things at last minute.

03:12.267 --> 03:14.133
We don't like having a last
chance at anything.

03:14.167 --> 03:15.767
We're pretty well prepared for
this time of year.

03:15.800 --> 03:18.667
We know when to utilise our
time and take the best
advantage of it.

03:18.700 --> 03:19.933
We make a living at this.

03:19.967 --> 03:21.867
We do it at
the appropriate time.

03:34.333 --> 03:35.967
Yee! Deep enough?

03:38.167 --> 03:40.967
The took weighs as heavy
as I do probably.

03:41.667 --> 03:43.300
It's like 40 pounds.

03:44.433 --> 03:46.700
I'm getting tired enough.

03:46.733 --> 03:49.500
Before it starts storming
this winter, we need to
make a shop.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.600
So I got a shop
planned out here

03:52.633 --> 03:54.233
I left before the snow came.

03:54.933 --> 03:57.000
I got wood right here.

03:57.033 --> 03:59.000
I got holes I've been
working on for digging.

03:59.867 --> 04:01.500
And now I've
got some more time.

04:03.633 --> 04:06.533
NARRATOR: Chip and Agnes
Hailstone are using their
harvested wood supply

04:06.567 --> 04:08.767
to construct a tented
workshop,

04:08.800 --> 04:12.400
which will shield them
as they toil in the harsh
conditions of dark winter.

04:14.200 --> 04:17.267
The time to do outside
work is now.

04:17.300 --> 04:19.767
So that's what we do this
time of the year.

04:28.700 --> 04:30.967
CHIP: Now I'm up to needing a
shop for the winter.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.433
I need a place to work
and I need a place
out of the weather.

04:33.467 --> 04:36.267
And we're about to go into
darkness anyway.

04:36.300 --> 04:39.033
Wood is a really
excellent material.

04:39.067 --> 04:42.400
It's a renewable resource,
it grows all around us
around here,

04:42.433 --> 04:44.933
and you can make almost
anything out of wood.

04:44.967 --> 04:47.000
And if I can't make it,
then I probably don't need it.

04:52.367 --> 04:53.767
We're about half done.

04:53.800 --> 04:55.700
We've got some more
tarps to put up.

04:55.733 --> 04:58.533
You got the front,
front cut up?

04:58.567 --> 05:00.200
It's looking like it's going
to work out.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.067
It turned out really well.

05:04.933 --> 05:06.633
-You like it?
-I like it.

05:06.667 --> 05:07.700
This is awesome.

05:07.733 --> 05:09.167
Yep.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.600
Perfect size.

05:11.633 --> 05:14.967
I think we could drive a snow
machine right in there.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.400
Yeah, you can drive right
in here, we can service
our rides right here.

05:18.433 --> 05:21.200
This will be a good place
to hang out. We can put
the fireplace right here.

05:21.233 --> 05:23.367
So as my woodpile is
getting a little smaller

05:23.400 --> 05:24.833
and I've got my scraps
to burn here,

05:24.867 --> 05:26.633
I probably have about
a week's worth
of wood sitting around.

05:26.667 --> 05:28.967
I'll probably first
go out and get me
a load of wood.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.467
Keeping up ahead
of myself that way.

05:31.500 --> 05:34.767
GLENN: I didn't just read a
couple books and then say,

05:34.800 --> 05:35.900
"Oh, I'm just gonna walk out
in the middle of the

05:35.933 --> 05:37.433
"wilderness and figure
out how to live."

05:37.467 --> 05:40.467
I took the time to learn what
I needed to learn
and it took years.

05:40.500 --> 05:42.833
I took my time about it.
That's why I survived.

05:53.367 --> 05:55.933
There's the sun just barely
over the horizon.

05:57.633 --> 05:59.833
It won't be there tomorrow.

05:59.867 --> 06:02.300
The sun is just about to set
for the last time

06:02.333 --> 06:04.167
here at my camp for
over 100 days.

06:06.567 --> 06:09.500
It will shine on the highest
mountains for a while longer.

06:09.533 --> 06:12.300
Eventually, in the deepest,
darkest part of winter,

06:12.333 --> 06:14.667
it will disappear even from
the highest peak.

06:16.533 --> 06:19.200
This is a time when things
start to change

06:19.233 --> 06:21.900
and it goes into dark winter
and it gets very cold.

06:21.933 --> 06:25.433
So the darkest, coldest part
of the winter is just ahead.

06:26.167 --> 06:27.733
More than 100 days from now

06:27.767 --> 06:29.300
the sun will rise right there.

06:29.333 --> 06:32.300
Until then, I won't see it
down here in the valley.

06:35.867 --> 06:38.533
This time of year,
one of the most important
things for me

06:38.567 --> 06:39.967
is to keep my camp heated.

06:41.433 --> 06:42.700
And to have enough
wood to do that,

06:42.733 --> 06:44.633
I have to work at
it almost continuously.

06:46.800 --> 06:49.400
I go through a cord of wood
in one month during this dark

06:49.433 --> 06:51.367
period of the winter
that's coming up.

06:51.400 --> 06:54.133
So I have to be cutting wood,
bringing it home,
splitting it all the time.

06:59.467 --> 07:02.900
This is a pile of wood
that I stacked up here
before it snowed.

07:02.933 --> 07:06.100
At that time of year,
it's harder to move
the wood around.

07:06.133 --> 07:07.633
So I left it here,

07:07.667 --> 07:09.333
came back for it
now with my sled.

07:09.367 --> 07:11.567
It's easier to drag
it in the snow.

07:11.600 --> 07:15.233
This is the last pile of wood
that I have stacked
up out here.

07:15.267 --> 07:17.633
Firewood is my only
fuel out here.

07:17.667 --> 07:20.733
I don't have any other source
of fuel than this wood.

07:23.100 --> 07:24.700
This is what I heat
my cabin with.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.767
It's what I cook
all my food on.

07:28.800 --> 07:31.167
It's how I heat hot water
if I want to take a bath

07:32.833 --> 07:35.067
or do some laundry.

07:35.100 --> 07:36.667
Without firewood,
I couldn't live out here.

07:37.667 --> 07:41.333
Firewood also warms me
up just processing it.

07:41.367 --> 07:44.700
It's cold out,
but doing this kind of work,

07:44.733 --> 07:46.667
I really can't even
wear that parka.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.567
In really cold weather,

07:49.600 --> 07:52.500
I could burn up this whole
sled load in just 24 hours.

07:53.567 --> 07:55.833
There. I got a load of wood.

07:55.867 --> 07:57.400
I'm gonna head home.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.133
Whoa!

08:04.167 --> 08:05.967
Yeah, you've got to be careful
going down hills.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.500
This is a heavy pile of wood.

08:07.533 --> 08:09.067
It can get out of control
and it goes fast.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.100
One last hill and then
I'm home free.

08:13.133 --> 08:14.867
Once I get to the lake,
it gets a lot easier.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.567
I really enjoy firewood
because firewood
gets me out,

08:23.333 --> 08:25.200
I get a lot of exercise.

08:25.233 --> 08:27.033
I always have fun working
on firewood.

08:27.733 --> 08:29.667
Got it back to camp.

08:29.700 --> 08:32.700
I've gotta go cut some more
wood so I have plenty of wood.

08:32.733 --> 08:34.833
It's a long, cold,
dark winter out here

08:34.867 --> 08:36.633
and I do go through
a lot of firewood.

08:41.933 --> 08:45.333
SUE: There's life lessons in
every single waking moment
of the day

08:46.100 --> 08:48.533
if you pay attention.

08:48.567 --> 08:51.500
If I don't risk my beak today,
I'll be here tomorrow.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.000
I was only expecting to be
gone under a week.

09:13.233 --> 09:16.967
But I ended up being gone
15, 16 days.

09:18.933 --> 09:22.933
NARRATOR: After undergoing
a crucial foot procedure
in Fairbanks

09:22.967 --> 09:26.833
and struggling to return home
due to a massive blizzard,

09:26.867 --> 09:29.067
Sue Aikens has just
reached Kavik.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.733
SUE: Getting home,
finding out that, you know,

09:34.767 --> 09:38.233
I'm just that far enough off
the coast, I didn't get hit
with the storm.

09:38.267 --> 09:40.533
I got some drifts.
I got some stuff going on.

09:40.567 --> 09:42.300
But that's a huge
relief to me.

09:42.333 --> 09:44.000
I feel just waves of relief.

09:45.767 --> 09:48.733
I just wanna relax,
drink my tea,
and get some sleep.

09:48.767 --> 09:50.700
Sleep where for the first time

09:50.733 --> 09:53.400
in over two weeks I'm not
worried and stressing
about camp.

09:54.800 --> 09:57.233
Now that I'm back, I do have
a lot of snow places

09:57.267 --> 09:59.167
that just shouldn't be for
camp to be effective.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.933
I've got to move that.
I need to do a search
around camp.

10:01.967 --> 10:04.700
I saw, flying in,
I saw some bigger tracks.

10:04.733 --> 10:07.733
Saw an animal.
Looked to me like
maybe wolf-ish,

10:07.767 --> 10:11.333
but you know, curled up out
about a mile, half a mile off
the end of the runway.

10:13.167 --> 10:16.333
Are you kidding me?
That's not good.

10:21.033 --> 10:24.167
All right.
That's not good.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.800
That means my generator
just went down.

10:26.833 --> 10:29.267
So the first thing I've got to
do is just get out there.

10:30.667 --> 10:32.900
Other than the light on
my head, there's no
lights in camp.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.400
And I can't hear the sound of
the generator.

10:37.767 --> 10:38.867
Shit.

10:39.933 --> 10:41.533
Okay.

10:41.567 --> 10:45.000
That's my switch.
It's in the down position,
so it was delivering.

10:45.033 --> 10:46.600
This didn't get slapped up.

10:46.633 --> 10:49.333
I don't see anything
real obvious.

10:49.367 --> 10:50.833
I need to check the fuel.

10:57.533 --> 10:59.500
Fucking oil change.

11:00.267 --> 11:01.400
Fucking A.

11:03.233 --> 11:06.333
It takes almost a full gallon
for an oil change.

11:06.367 --> 11:09.300
Got the new oil filter in.
I know I have fuel.

11:09.333 --> 11:10.667
What does a gen need?

11:10.700 --> 11:13.667
Fuel, oil, air, spark.

11:14.433 --> 11:15.700
(ENGINE RUNNING)

11:18.233 --> 11:20.100
The generator runs.

11:20.133 --> 11:22.133
It's sending power here.

11:22.800 --> 11:24.767
It's being created,

11:24.800 --> 11:26.367
but is it being delivered?

11:27.667 --> 11:29.533
Please say it's fucking on.

11:34.500 --> 11:37.667
Ah! My kitchen
lights aren't on.

11:38.067 --> 11:39.967
Fuck.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.700
I'm gonna go
to the dining hall,

11:42.733 --> 11:45.333
look at the breakers,
try and figure it out.

11:46.033 --> 11:48.033
So goes the calm evening.

11:51.667 --> 11:53.700
No rhyme. No reason.

11:53.733 --> 11:57.933
I didn't add to the load,
take away from the load,
it just quit working.

12:03.367 --> 12:04.633
Aha!

12:07.133 --> 12:09.000
I do have it now
in the kitchen.

12:09.033 --> 12:12.000
If I have it in the kitchen,
I have it in the dining hall,

12:12.033 --> 12:16.233
which means I have
it on my spotlights.

12:16.267 --> 12:19.300
If people are in trouble and
they need to land,

12:19.333 --> 12:22.567
that means they're gonna
see that spotlight and land.

12:22.600 --> 12:25.300
Bam. Lights on.
Bam, lights on.

12:26.100 --> 12:28.000
Bam, Susie did good.

12:29.400 --> 12:32.567
Not what you plan on when
it's real cold and real dark,

12:32.600 --> 12:34.867
but you know, when do you
even plan a disaster?

12:40.733 --> 12:42.900
AGNES: Once you leave here,
the plan changes.

12:42.933 --> 12:44.800
You just have to take
it as it comes.

12:44.833 --> 12:46.900
There's all kinds of
difficulties and stuff.

12:47.667 --> 12:49.267
You never know
what can happen.

13:05.133 --> 13:07.100
For the last couple
weeks it's been real cold.

13:08.567 --> 13:11.433
Last week it was minus 40
for a week straight.

13:13.067 --> 13:16.433
And everybody's been
burning double the amount
of stove oil,

13:16.467 --> 13:17.700
double the amount of wood.

13:17.733 --> 13:20.433
And usually we have a stack
of wood

13:20.467 --> 13:22.167
and we don't have
to worry about heating,

13:22.200 --> 13:24.100
but this is getting kind
of critical.

13:24.133 --> 13:25.833
-Are you ready?
-Yep.

13:27.233 --> 13:28.867
This is subsistence.

13:28.900 --> 13:32.400
This is going out and getting
what's at hand and using
it here to make a living.

13:32.433 --> 13:35.533
And what we have at hand
along these rivers here,
in the arctic, is trees.

13:35.567 --> 13:37.900
So we've got lots of firewood.

13:37.933 --> 13:40.767
Firewood's a really, really
important commodity up here.

13:40.800 --> 13:43.033
It's energy. And the more
firewood I can burn,

13:43.067 --> 13:46.100
the less stove oil I have to
buy. It's just economy.

13:46.133 --> 13:48.000
I'd rather buy ten gallons of
gas, and go out,

13:48.033 --> 13:49.800
and go get a whole bunch of
firewood than I'd want

13:49.833 --> 13:51.633
to spend for just two days of
heat in my house.

13:54.300 --> 13:56.267
They ask people,
especially if they have
snow machines,

13:56.300 --> 13:57.900
to go at least five miles out.

13:57.933 --> 14:01.467
We go ten about miles,
cause we know some really
good wooded spots.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.967
In any direction that you
go around here where
there's the delta and

14:04.000 --> 14:05.800
where there's the river,
there's definitely trees.

14:05.833 --> 14:07.667
And they just don't want
to over impact the area.

14:14.233 --> 14:15.733
AGNES: Not too far away, huh?

14:15.767 --> 14:16.833
CHIP: No.

14:19.133 --> 14:21.833
Gathering firewood is
a continuous and a
thankless job.

14:21.867 --> 14:23.300
It takes a lot of
physical stamina.

14:24.567 --> 14:26.733
It takes a lot of work
outside in the
cold weather.

14:26.767 --> 14:29.100
It doesn't take eight bucks a
gallon like it does
for stove oil.

14:29.133 --> 14:31.800
So it's better to get
gasoline to spend the gas
with the chainsaw.

14:31.833 --> 14:33.900
I can heat this house with
an axe,

14:33.933 --> 14:36.333
but then it's just a constant
chore that I'm not up to that.

14:36.367 --> 14:38.500
I'd rather have a mechanical
advantage and
I like my chainsaw.

14:40.767 --> 14:42.000
(GRUNTING)

14:46.600 --> 14:49.100
Okay, let's just leave it
there for five minutes, have a
cup of coffee.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.500
It should start after that.

14:52.133 --> 14:53.433
Yeah, let's hope so.

14:55.800 --> 14:57.867
ANDY: It's a very physical
life, living out here.

14:58.933 --> 15:00.967
I don't do a 9 to 5.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.933
It doesn't mean that we're
not working.

15:02.967 --> 15:04.400
If you like getting out,
and working,

15:04.433 --> 15:06.633
and doing things for yourself
it's a great lifestyle.

15:19.967 --> 15:23.100
Kate found a little baby
cub in our fish rack.

15:23.133 --> 15:24.800
I don't see any
big bear prints.

15:24.833 --> 15:27.733
I don't see any mama prints
around or anything like that.

15:27.767 --> 15:29.167
It's time to do a little
construction,

15:29.200 --> 15:31.433
a little modification
of a dog box.

15:31.467 --> 15:33.767
And we'll try and tranquilise
him or whatever,

15:33.800 --> 15:35.600
get him into that box.

15:35.633 --> 15:38.167
And then at least everything's
under control.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.567
Hopefully have a happy
ending for the little guy.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.533
NARRATOR: After discovering
the bear cub,

15:44.567 --> 15:47.233
Kate immediately contacted
the Department of Fish
and Game

15:47.267 --> 15:50.100
for guidance in handling
orphaned wildlife.

15:50.133 --> 15:51.933
While waiting on a
possible rescue,

15:51.967 --> 15:55.033
getting the bear out from
under the fish rack is
their priority.

16:00.700 --> 16:02.900
That looks like a good
size for him.

16:02.933 --> 16:06.133
Every day is inventing
something new out here.

16:06.167 --> 16:07.700
It's a land of extremes

16:08.600 --> 16:10.267
that every day you have
to adapt.

16:12.167 --> 16:15.367
Well, I didn't think
I'd be doing this when
I woke up this morning.

16:15.400 --> 16:16.867
I like inventing stuff.

16:16.900 --> 16:18.900
That's a big part of my
life out here.

16:18.933 --> 16:23.000
I like the challenge of
waking up everyday,
and creating new things,

16:23.033 --> 16:24.633
and seeing if ideas work.

16:24.667 --> 16:26.833
If you look around,
everything I have
is modified.

16:28.067 --> 16:29.200
You know what
you could do?

16:29.233 --> 16:31.233
Go over by the guest cabin
and get that long,

16:31.267 --> 16:34.967
aluminium pole so I can
set up a syringe.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.633
Well, the idea is just to
mount the syringe with the
sedative on a pole,

16:40.633 --> 16:43.367
then reach in from a distance
and poke him.

16:43.400 --> 16:46.100
I don't think he's gonna let
me get close to him without
freaking out

16:46.133 --> 16:48.167
and wanting to run.
So if I can get

16:48.200 --> 16:50.333
eight feet away from
him and just take the syringe

16:50.367 --> 16:52.367
and poke him with it and get
the sedative,

16:52.400 --> 16:53.867
it goes into the muscle.

16:53.900 --> 16:56.067
It doesn't have
to go into a vein.

17:06.333 --> 17:10.900
This is just tranquiliser
that we use for our dogs
when we get porcupine

17:10.933 --> 17:12.200
quills in the dogs.

17:12.233 --> 17:14.933
It's a half a millimetre for
about a 60-pound dog.

17:14.967 --> 17:17.267
I'm just gonna put just a
small amount.

17:23.133 --> 17:24.867
Hi little guy.
We're not gonna hurt you.

17:24.900 --> 17:26.767
We're gonna just help
you a little bit okay?

17:38.333 --> 17:40.633
It's okay, you smell that.
It's okay.

17:40.667 --> 17:42.133
Don't eat it.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.300
It's okay.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.600
Yep, bent the needle.

17:47.633 --> 17:49.967
Yeah, well, I don't think
anything went in him.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.667
I think the syringe
is broke.

17:52.700 --> 17:55.167
Sometimes you gotta be a
little bit cruel to be kind.

17:55.200 --> 17:58.567
So we'll get him relaxed
and then we can pick him up,

17:58.600 --> 18:00.533
put him in the box,
and feed him,

18:00.567 --> 18:03.033
and water him,
and make sure he's really
warm and comfortable,

18:03.067 --> 18:05.100
and wait for the Department
of Fish and Game

18:05.133 --> 18:06.833
to get someone
in to rescue it.

18:06.867 --> 18:09.367
He's coming back this way.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.867
There you go.
Why don't you just settle
down there?

18:12.300 --> 18:13.900
Let's try again.

18:16.800 --> 18:18.300
Got a little bit in
him, I think.

18:19.700 --> 18:21.767
You know where I keep
my skis and everything?

18:21.800 --> 18:26.700
I have a wooden pole there
that has a snare wire on it

18:26.733 --> 18:29.667
that I use when I trap things
that are alive.

18:29.700 --> 18:32.933
If you go grab that I can
maybe just grab him
around the body with that,

18:32.967 --> 18:34.100
then we can get him.

18:37.400 --> 18:39.200
Here he is,
this is where
I want him.

18:39.233 --> 18:41.367
Good boy.
Good boy.

18:43.100 --> 18:44.533
Gotta get it done before

18:45.633 --> 18:48.433
the last little bit of
sunlight goes.

18:48.467 --> 18:50.867
Hard enough job in the
daylight, let alone the dark.

18:54.767 --> 18:57.000
It looks like he's
starting to go down
right now.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.467
Got it, Andy.

19:15.333 --> 19:17.267
Got you. Got you,
got you, got you. Good boy.

19:17.300 --> 19:20.700
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

19:24.433 --> 19:26.467
Here we go.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.700
It's okay.

19:28.733 --> 19:31.400
It's coming off.
It's coming off.
It's coming off.

19:32.100 --> 19:33.800
There you go.
Where's the lid?

19:33.833 --> 19:35.033
I've got the lid.

19:37.467 --> 19:41.300
Flip that thing, man.
All right.

19:41.333 --> 19:43.933
We kill things to eat it and
we don't have a problem

19:43.967 --> 19:45.433
with killing things
that we're gonna eat.

19:45.467 --> 19:49.100
But I'm not gonna kill
a ten-pound cub for five
pounds of meat.

19:49.133 --> 19:53.100
But we can certainly take care
of him until someone can
come and pick him up.

19:53.133 --> 19:55.633
AGNES: Even though it's day,
after day, after day,

19:55.667 --> 19:59.367
after day of extreme hard
work, bad weather,
rough conditions,

19:59.400 --> 20:00.633
we still love it.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.033
We're proud of what we do.

20:13.633 --> 20:16.933
I'll try. I'll just have
to use my foot.

20:20.300 --> 20:22.767
I think it's just
extremely cold.

20:22.800 --> 20:25.933
Good summer saw.
It's another
good winter saw.

20:25.967 --> 20:28.033
Cold days like this,
things break.

20:28.067 --> 20:31.500
Things don't start.
We have trouble.

20:31.533 --> 20:35.200
You have to just keep trying
and eventually it will either
start or you have

20:35.233 --> 20:36.700
to run home,
get a new chainsaw,

20:36.733 --> 20:39.800
or a different chainsaw,
or just start chopping wood.

20:51.567 --> 20:53.367
Let's check it out
one more time.

20:53.400 --> 20:54.833
Throttle or no throttle?

20:54.867 --> 20:56.467
No throttle.

21:03.367 --> 21:04.667
Oh, yay!

21:18.800 --> 21:21.100
CHIP: You don't count on
things until you've got them
in your hands.

21:21.133 --> 21:22.933
And even then,
it's still maybe.

21:22.967 --> 21:24.300
There's a lot of things
that can happen out there.

21:24.333 --> 21:25.533
Your chainsaw could quit.

21:26.633 --> 21:27.933
But we stuck with it.

21:27.967 --> 21:30.367
We kept pulling on that
thing and it finally
fired up for us.

21:33.600 --> 21:36.267
Pretty much he cuts them
down and I limb them.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.200
CHIP: Firewood is fuel.
And you need it to stay warm,

21:43.233 --> 21:45.633
and being the arctic,
and seeing how we're
at 30 below zero,

21:45.667 --> 21:47.833
it's a pretty important
commodity to have.

21:47.867 --> 21:48.933
Probably a sled load.

21:51.100 --> 21:53.600
Daylight's burning.
I'm almost done.

21:57.167 --> 21:58.300
(SIGHING)

21:58.333 --> 21:59.600
That's all
for this sled.

21:59.633 --> 22:02.467
Yep.
That's all it can carry.

22:02.500 --> 22:05.600
CHIP: We've got about 15
minutes of daylight left,
so for us right now,

22:05.633 --> 22:07.933
it's time to tie down and get
ourselves on the trail.

22:07.967 --> 22:11.167
When darkness comes,
we just, this isn't the job,
work to do.

22:11.200 --> 22:12.467
-Wanna go home?
-Go home.

22:12.500 --> 22:14.000
By then it should be
dark, yeah?

22:14.033 --> 22:15.167
It will be dark by then.

22:16.867 --> 22:18.600
There's more logs to be
had, all right.

22:18.633 --> 22:20.833
But time's ticking and the
sun's going down.

22:20.867 --> 22:22.533
We have like 15,
20 minutes left.

22:24.567 --> 22:27.100
We need to have a couple
week's worth of wood
because we have children

22:27.133 --> 22:29.200
and they all need heat.
And it's the warmest
heat,

22:29.233 --> 22:31.833
it's probably the one where
it could be 40 below and
people in the house

22:31.867 --> 22:33.767
are complaining that
it's too hot. So,

22:33.800 --> 22:34.900
that's all right
with me too.

22:40.833 --> 22:45.967
SUE: I've learned to give the
weather in Alaska the
highest form of respect.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.200
It will kill you if it
has a chance.

22:48.233 --> 22:50.500
You don't know, but you better
be checking for it.

23:01.867 --> 23:05.467
I'm about ready to go
through the worst three
months of my season.

23:05.500 --> 23:07.433
Conditions can
be quite brutal.

23:09.433 --> 23:11.433
It's just constant upkeep.

23:11.467 --> 23:13.267
Keep the paths clear.

23:13.300 --> 23:15.200
Check the buildings
as you go.

23:15.233 --> 23:17.500
Keep an eye out and see
if something's coming at you.

23:19.133 --> 23:22.133
And you never know.
Opportunity knocks on
your door sometimes.

23:22.167 --> 23:25.033
You're doing one thing
and then all of a sudden,
you know,

23:25.067 --> 23:28.667
some freaking lost caribou
runs across your vision
and if you need the meat,

23:28.700 --> 23:31.067
you have an opportunity.

23:31.100 --> 23:33.333
My meat supply is a little bit
low. I wanna fill it up.

23:37.600 --> 23:40.133
Hold on. Hold on.

23:43.067 --> 23:44.567
I got ptarmigan.

23:44.600 --> 23:47.433
Awesome. Find my .22.

23:48.300 --> 23:49.533
This time of year, you know,

23:49.567 --> 23:51.200
fresh meat is
good for me to get.

23:53.633 --> 23:55.300
They're around
here somewhere.

23:59.167 --> 24:00.367
Where are they at?

24:07.867 --> 24:09.033
There they are.

24:10.367 --> 24:12.333
And they're really
hard to see.

24:12.367 --> 24:14.233
They just look like
little white balls,

24:14.267 --> 24:15.700
but they're on a white
background.

24:15.733 --> 24:17.767
Oh, oh, oh.
There he goes,
he's flying to the branch.

24:22.233 --> 24:23.500
(SHOT FIRED)

24:23.533 --> 24:27.467
Nailed that one.
Don't you get my bird!

24:27.500 --> 24:30.433
That's my bird!
No, that's mine!

24:31.167 --> 24:32.767
You naughty fox.

24:34.167 --> 24:35.900
Whenever I'm shooting
I've got to be careful.

24:35.933 --> 24:37.567
A, I gotta know where
my foxies are.

24:37.600 --> 24:39.000
But B, I've got to get to
it before they do.

24:40.100 --> 24:41.533
It's their food source too.

24:44.567 --> 24:47.233
Well, looks like I got one,

24:47.267 --> 24:49.600
but little Slinky
made off with one too.

24:51.200 --> 24:54.433
I got two, but you've
gotta be faster than
your hunting partner.

25:00.867 --> 25:03.967
There's the gizzard.
A little bit of liver.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.233
What is he eating?
Willows.

25:06.267 --> 25:08.733
Willow buds, willow
branches.

25:08.767 --> 25:10.900
So by looking at that,
what does it tell me?

25:10.933 --> 25:13.200
It tells me where to keep
looking if I wanna find
the birdies.

25:17.867 --> 25:21.133
I get a couple more like
this and I'll have a
nice, little meal.

25:22.800 --> 25:24.167
Thank you, little birdie.

25:26.933 --> 25:28.533
It was a nice little
diversion,

25:28.567 --> 25:30.233
nice little snack for me,
but I've got to get
back to work.

25:34.133 --> 25:36.667
GLENN: This lifestyle,
it's just basic,

25:36.700 --> 25:38.633
fundamental processes
of nature.

25:40.067 --> 25:43.700
It's direct contact
with reality.
It's unmediated.

25:44.600 --> 25:45.967
That's what I like.

25:52.833 --> 25:55.700
I've got enough wood
here for four or five days
of really cold weather.

25:57.067 --> 25:58.900
That's not very long.

26:00.767 --> 26:02.067
Time to go cut some
more wood.

26:02.100 --> 26:04.733
That's the last of the wood
that I've already got cut.

26:04.767 --> 26:07.700
These are the sized trees
that I'm normally cutting
for my firewood now.

26:07.733 --> 26:09.867
And the reason I'm cutting
those sized trees,

26:09.900 --> 26:11.733
in part, is because
I'm using an axe

26:11.767 --> 26:14.433
and cutting larger trees
is inefficient with that axe.

26:14.467 --> 26:17.133
What I want to do is try this
saw out and see

26:17.167 --> 26:19.233
if this is efficient to
cut larger wood.

26:21.033 --> 26:24.867
This is a new tool
I picked up the last time
I was down in Fairbanks.

26:24.900 --> 26:26.867
It's a crosscut timber saw.

26:26.900 --> 26:28.567
And I've never used it.

26:28.600 --> 26:31.800
I'm gonna try it out and see
if this might make it
a little bit easier for me

26:31.833 --> 26:33.167
to get my firewood.

26:37.233 --> 26:39.900
There's a lot of time
spent handling small
pieces of wood.

26:39.933 --> 26:41.300
So I'm looking for a big tree.

26:42.567 --> 26:44.300
With this saw that I've got,

26:44.333 --> 26:47.633
I can process possibly
a bigger tree than I used
to more efficiently.

26:48.600 --> 26:51.033
Wow, there is a tree
right there.

26:51.067 --> 26:53.267
That is a big tree with
a lot of firewood in it.

26:53.300 --> 26:55.400
Way bigger than
I'd normally cut.

26:55.433 --> 26:58.533
But with this saw,
it might be feasible.

26:58.567 --> 27:00.200
There's a pretty dense
forest here.

27:00.233 --> 27:01.900
It's a big tree.
If it gets hung up,

27:01.933 --> 27:04.867
I won't be able to use
it. I won't be able to
get it down out of these

27:04.900 --> 27:07.000
trees with the tools I
have on hand.

27:07.033 --> 27:09.167
So I'm gonna have
to be very careful

27:10.833 --> 27:12.200
and see if I can
get it to fall

27:12.233 --> 27:15.033
straight down that way.

27:15.067 --> 27:18.300
I used to pass trees this
size up because they were
too much to handle.

27:18.333 --> 27:21.733
But with that big saw maybe
I can process a tree this
size.

27:21.767 --> 27:25.600
Think of the firewood!
Just in that little section
that's a whole day's firewood

27:25.633 --> 27:27.333
in real cold weather.

27:27.367 --> 27:30.133
I'm used to having to cut a
few trees to get a day's
firewood in cold weather.

27:31.667 --> 27:33.300
This is a whole different
ball game here.

27:37.500 --> 27:39.100
(HOLLOW THUNK)

27:39.133 --> 27:41.000
Ooh, that doesn't
sound very good.

27:45.433 --> 27:48.267
This tree is very
hollow sounding.

27:49.600 --> 27:51.633
I'll see what's in there
when I cut into it.

28:03.867 --> 28:06.233
Okay, this is all rotten.
This is not good.

28:06.267 --> 28:08.100
Hopefully the rot doesn't
go up very far,

28:08.133 --> 28:11.733
so it's still worth cutting
down to get the firewood
out of the upper part.

28:11.767 --> 28:14.133
But it makes it a lot more
dangerous cutting it.

28:14.167 --> 28:16.000
Because that's not strong
wood in the middle.

28:16.033 --> 28:17.933
So it might break in an
unpredictable way.

28:21.800 --> 28:23.933
Okay, I'm gonna put in a
wedge now.

28:23.967 --> 28:26.433
Try to get the tree to tip
over the way I want it to.

28:27.267 --> 28:28.367
Okay.

28:29.500 --> 28:31.167
Look out! It's going!
It's going!

28:37.200 --> 28:38.467
Yeah!

28:39.600 --> 28:40.933
All right!

28:40.967 --> 28:42.500
Right where I wanted it.

28:42.800 --> 28:44.933
Perfect.

28:44.967 --> 28:47.100
Couldn't have
been better. That was
a little scary. Woo!

28:48.467 --> 28:50.100
That's a big one.

28:56.167 --> 28:58.200
Oh, that feels good.

28:59.433 --> 29:01.333
Look at that thing cut
through there.

29:04.467 --> 29:07.867
That's frozen wood,
18 below zero,
cutting right through it.

29:13.933 --> 29:16.000
Yes! Made it through!

29:17.100 --> 29:20.033
That is one awesome
saw right there.

29:20.067 --> 29:22.800
Look at that.
The rot doesn't go
too far, that's great.

29:22.833 --> 29:25.633
I was afraid that the whole
tree might have rot up
through it.

29:25.667 --> 29:28.200
I never tackled trees
this big before.

29:28.233 --> 29:30.667
I just didn't have the tool
for the job.

29:30.700 --> 29:33.800
Four, six.
That tree's about 160
years old.

29:34.700 --> 29:36.400
That tree lived longer
than I will.

29:36.433 --> 29:38.733
I just got to get it home.

29:38.767 --> 29:41.633
I got my work cut out for me
getting it back up
to the top here.

29:46.700 --> 29:49.100
CHIP: There's trading and then
there's selling stuff and
there's giving.

29:49.133 --> 29:51.000
You don't do it with an
expectation of return.

29:51.033 --> 29:52.767
But such a small society here,

29:52.800 --> 29:54.800
it comes back at you.
It's a big karma thing.

30:05.200 --> 30:06.500
I think we got
a lot of wood.

30:06.533 --> 30:08.000
Yeah, I think we have
enough too.

30:08.033 --> 30:10.533
We probably could give
away a couple.

30:10.567 --> 30:12.267
-A few sticks?
-Yeah.

30:12.300 --> 30:14.967
I was gonna
go see Erika pretty soon.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.967
-There you go.
-She's pregnant and her
honey's at work

30:17.000 --> 30:21.367
so I was thinking since she's
moving over to the house
where I grew up in,

30:21.400 --> 30:24.800
I figured I'd just go help
out and go throw them
a few logs.

30:24.833 --> 30:27.600
-Oh, yeah.
-We managed to bring a
couple loads home

30:27.633 --> 30:29.567
and since we have
enough wood,

30:29.600 --> 30:32.300
I'm just gonna go give
a load to my friend, Erika.

30:32.333 --> 30:34.667
You know, it's good
to share the wealth,

30:34.700 --> 30:36.367
maybe I'll take Ting to
help me, yeah?

30:36.400 --> 30:37.533
Oh, good idea.

30:37.567 --> 30:39.600
When I can give stuff away,
I freely give.

30:39.633 --> 30:40.967
My neighbours give to me.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.233
My wife's family gives to us.

30:42.267 --> 30:45.333
I give back. And there's
no charity involved.
It's just sharing.

30:45.367 --> 30:47.033
It's a big circle,
it will come around.

30:50.967 --> 30:53.100
You know, it's not like
they need it, or they're
begging for it,

30:53.133 --> 30:54.267
or they even asked for it.
It's just

30:54.300 --> 30:56.100
like maybe we can
just go fork over

30:56.133 --> 30:57.333
a couple logs and
help them out.

30:57.367 --> 30:58.900
And they should like that.
I'm sure they will.

30:58.933 --> 31:00.733
They've done it for me
in other ways.

31:05.533 --> 31:06.633
Yee!

31:11.000 --> 31:12.667
Hi!

31:12.700 --> 31:13.867
How are you doing?

31:13.900 --> 31:15.267
How's baby?

31:18.333 --> 31:20.400
We notice somebody needs
help somewhere,

31:20.433 --> 31:22.900
we try to help and then
later on if I need help,

31:22.933 --> 31:25.300
somebody will notice that I
probably need firewood

31:25.333 --> 31:27.500
or a little short of
something and they'll say,

31:27.533 --> 31:28.767
"Hey, I got this, I got that."

31:31.233 --> 31:32.967
Yeah. There's lots more
out there.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.367
We found a good pile where
there's lots of dead wood.

31:36.400 --> 31:40.367
Yeah. Around here,
it's a real good thing
to give what you can

31:40.400 --> 31:44.733
and share with other people
and friends and they'll help
you out in the long run.

31:44.767 --> 31:46.367
It's good karma.

31:47.733 --> 31:48.933
Yeah.

31:54.600 --> 31:55.667
-Yeah.
-Thank you again.

31:57.500 --> 31:58.600
Yeah, right on.

31:58.633 --> 32:00.167
-We'll see you again.
-Okay.

32:01.367 --> 32:02.700
Later!

32:07.033 --> 32:09.167
SUE: My Honey Do List is more
like a Honey Sue List.

32:09.200 --> 32:11.133
Sue's the only one
working on it.

32:11.167 --> 32:13.000
I'm not on anybody's
time clock.

32:13.033 --> 32:14.433
I just chip away at it.

32:25.633 --> 32:27.667
I'm just keeping on
doing my chores.

32:27.700 --> 32:29.133
You know,
real limited daylight.

32:30.300 --> 32:33.733
And one of the things that I
wanna check out

32:33.767 --> 32:36.067
is some
of my ice on the river

32:36.100 --> 32:37.933
is not as thick as it
usually is.

32:37.967 --> 32:42.800
And any chance I have
to resupply
myself with fresh water

32:42.833 --> 32:45.567
is a good opportunity to take.

32:45.600 --> 32:49.400
Yeah, I go through about 310
days without running
water here.

32:49.433 --> 32:53.233
And I give myself a little
under a gallon a day for all
of my needs.

32:53.267 --> 32:55.967
If I can bump it up,
I have a little bit of extra
to play with.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.033
To me it's not just 30
gallons of water,

32:59.067 --> 33:00.933
it's a month of life
giving water.

33:03.533 --> 33:05.367
I'm looking at this spot
right here,

33:05.400 --> 33:08.633
you've got the river and
you've got the ice.

33:08.667 --> 33:10.733
You've got a four
to six foot drop.

33:10.767 --> 33:12.367
That might not be too cool.

33:19.833 --> 33:23.900
A bunch of this river is
gonna be a little unsafe
for travel for me for a bit.

33:23.933 --> 33:26.833
I don't wanna drop
this thing that far
down a hole,

33:26.867 --> 33:30.533
but I am willing to walk out
there maybe and see if
I can't poke a little hole.

33:31.567 --> 33:33.467
I know the river pretty well.

33:34.167 --> 33:35.867
I just can't see.

33:35.900 --> 33:38.267
It's all covered in snow.
I don't know where the
rotten spots are.

33:41.167 --> 33:45.700
Trying to see if I can get
past this chunky layer.

33:45.733 --> 33:47.400
Where's my water?

33:47.433 --> 33:49.233
Yeah. I mean,
I'm getting rock

33:49.267 --> 33:50.800
and I'm not getting any water.

33:51.933 --> 33:53.900
Going out a bit further,
see what I find.

33:53.933 --> 33:55.733
Hopefully I don't find a
hole that I fall into.

34:02.533 --> 34:04.233
The ice is a little on
the thin side.

34:04.267 --> 34:07.900
If I hit a really deep spot,
Little Red's just gonna sink
to the bottom

34:07.933 --> 34:10.167
and I'll fish it out in
the spring if I can.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.367
I see liquid water.

34:50.767 --> 34:53.267
I have no idea what's
going on with
my crazy river.

34:58.233 --> 35:01.133
I don't know why there's
so little water running
underneath,

35:01.167 --> 35:02.667
but I'll take what I can get.

35:02.700 --> 35:04.333
You know, it's like liquid
gold to me.

35:11.067 --> 35:13.833
Right there.
Liquid water.

35:18.500 --> 35:22.267
You can see,
just from me pouring,
it's already freezing.

35:27.533 --> 35:32.233
This time of year, this
is a pretty good find.

35:32.267 --> 35:35.267
Had to go a little
further away from camp
than I'd intended.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.100
But now I wanna get it home
before it freezes.

35:41.500 --> 35:44.600
I don't have running water
for 300 to 310 days a year.

35:44.633 --> 35:46.867
You gotta ration the water
that you do have,

35:46.900 --> 35:48.967
but when you have a little
bit of excess,

35:49.000 --> 35:50.567
maybe I'll get clean socks
out of the bargain.

35:54.633 --> 35:57.033
Getting cold fast.
Easy breezy.

35:59.967 --> 36:02.700
I won't lose my water,

36:02.733 --> 36:04.833
but I've got to get it
home as quick as I can.

36:16.633 --> 36:19.233
Right now to get fresh
river water

36:19.267 --> 36:20.900
that I can
drink, drink, drink,

36:20.933 --> 36:22.167
that's a big find.

36:22.200 --> 36:24.233
Instead of rationing it
down this tight,

36:24.267 --> 36:25.600
I can ration it down
that tight.

36:27.567 --> 36:29.367
A couple of hours' worth
of roaming around,

36:29.400 --> 36:31.433
having fun, checking out
the sights,

36:31.467 --> 36:33.567
there's a couple of months'
worth of good product for me.

36:36.600 --> 36:39.700
Hi there. You were no help.

36:39.733 --> 36:41.967
You were no help at all there,
little Slinks.

36:42.933 --> 36:45.133
I know.
You wanna say hi?

36:46.933 --> 36:48.867
Did mom go and get water?

36:48.900 --> 36:50.433
Yeah. Yeah.

36:50.467 --> 36:53.567
(LAUGHING)

36:53.600 --> 36:57.733
KATE: You can't live in the
wilderness without having
a connection to these animals,

36:57.767 --> 36:59.700
and a love for them,
and a respect for them.

36:59.733 --> 37:01.167
I've never been
afraid of them,

37:01.200 --> 37:03.100
and I've come pretty damn
close to a lot of them.

37:21.333 --> 37:23.833
Hi, Baba.
Hi, Baba.

37:23.867 --> 37:25.833
Today's day is all about
saying goodbye.

37:25.867 --> 37:28.933
Fish and Game is bringing
out an aeroplane,
landing on our lake,

37:28.967 --> 37:31.233
and he's flying to Fairbanks
where he'll be

37:31.267 --> 37:33.900
under their care
from this point on.

37:33.933 --> 37:36.567
I am totally in love with
this little guy.

37:36.600 --> 37:40.467
Hoping we can save this
bear, but at this point
in time we have to turn

37:40.500 --> 37:43.967
it over because of state
law we're not allowed to
hold onto the bear.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.733
Still a lot of work to do
before this becomes
a happy ending.

37:46.767 --> 37:48.700
But we've done our part

37:48.733 --> 37:50.133
to try and save him.

37:50.167 --> 37:53.467
And now it's gonna be up to
the Department
of Fish and Game

37:53.500 --> 37:55.133
to help us place this bear.

38:05.167 --> 38:06.733
-How's it going, Jeff?
-How's it going, Andy?

38:06.767 --> 38:08.500
-How are you?
-I'm doing good!

38:08.533 --> 38:09.700
-Good flight in?
-Good to see you.

38:09.733 --> 38:11.767
My name is Jeff Gross. I'm the

38:11.800 --> 38:15.567
area wildlife
biologist and I've come
up today to retrieve

38:15.600 --> 38:19.667
a bear cub that wandered
into Andy Bassich's
smoke house

38:19.700 --> 38:21.633
and bring him back up
to Fairbanks.

38:23.933 --> 38:26.567
I'm thinking what we
ought to do is we'll just
bring the kennel inside

38:26.600 --> 38:27.767
there so it's close by.

38:27.800 --> 38:29.667
Get it all set up, get
some straw in it,

38:29.700 --> 38:31.300
see if he'll come out on
his own.

38:31.333 --> 38:33.800
If he does,
I think it's gonna be pretty
easy to just put him in.

38:33.833 --> 38:35.833
I'm gonna do my best to
keep him happy

38:35.867 --> 38:37.900
-and comfortable
while I have him. So...
-Well...

38:37.933 --> 38:39.767
I'll just have him for
a little bit.

38:39.800 --> 38:41.900
There's so many of them
that die in the wild.

38:41.933 --> 38:43.133
-Mmm-hmm.
-And

38:43.167 --> 38:44.500
there's nothing you
can do about it.

38:44.533 --> 38:46.267
But this little guy
came to us.

38:46.300 --> 38:48.700
You know, he had the
strength, courage,

38:48.733 --> 38:51.167
and fortitude to find a place
that was suitable.

38:51.200 --> 38:52.533
So he's a smart little bear.

38:52.567 --> 38:55.367
It's not incredibly rare
that a cub would be
abandoned,

38:55.400 --> 38:58.233
or have a mother killed,
or die from other natural
causes.

38:58.267 --> 39:01.867
Mortality of cubs is pretty
high in the first
year of life.

39:01.900 --> 39:04.267
Good boy. You're a good,
cooperative little guy.

39:05.433 --> 39:07.467
When we get the cub back
to Fairbanks,

39:07.500 --> 39:10.500
it'll be placed into
a permitted holding
facility to see

39:10.533 --> 39:13.300
if we can find a place to
permanently house
the bear.

39:13.333 --> 39:16.133
Hopefully it will work out
really well and
fairly quickly.

39:17.533 --> 39:18.900
-Take care.
-Fly safe.

39:18.933 --> 39:20.600
Keep my Baba safe.

39:22.500 --> 39:24.067
I think he's a survivor.

39:24.100 --> 39:26.933
I think he's got some
good instincts and I
think both of us

39:26.967 --> 39:28.500
feel like he did his part,

39:28.533 --> 39:32.667
now we humans need to do
our part to try and give him
a chance

39:32.700 --> 39:36.200
and to find this bear the
best opportunity
for a long life.

39:41.867 --> 39:44.233
GLENN: I really like all the
natural sounds around here.

39:45.933 --> 39:48.833
-I like to listen to
the wolves howling.
-(HOWLING)

39:48.867 --> 39:51.900
I listen to the music the
loons make.

39:51.933 --> 39:54.467
-(LOON CALLING)
-I like to listen to the bull
moose grunting.

39:54.500 --> 39:56.033
That's the music for
me out here.

40:06.800 --> 40:09.367
22 below Fahrenheit right
now. That's pretty cold.

40:10.600 --> 40:12.267
That just helps stabilise it.

40:13.200 --> 40:14.267
Hold it in place.

40:23.333 --> 40:25.567
Ah. Look at this chunk
of firewood.

40:28.167 --> 40:29.300
Cut it one more time.

40:33.967 --> 40:36.233
I'm out here because I
like the peace and quiet.

40:36.267 --> 40:37.833
I'm out here because
I like the fresh air.

40:37.867 --> 40:40.100
I don't want to have
the noise.

40:40.133 --> 40:42.867
I don't want to have
the exhaust of a
modern chainsaw

40:42.900 --> 40:44.433
running out here
if I can avoid it.

40:44.467 --> 40:45.967
I enjoy this experience.

40:51.667 --> 40:52.833
Yeah!

40:58.267 --> 41:00.100
Okay. Time to split them.

41:00.133 --> 41:01.900
This is a big piece
of wood to split,

41:01.933 --> 41:03.333
but I've got the temperature
on my side.

41:03.367 --> 41:05.267
It's about 20 below zero.

41:07.200 --> 41:10.900
The wood just becomes easier
to split the colder it gets.

41:13.167 --> 41:14.600
Look at that. It went.

41:30.533 --> 41:31.600
Beautiful.

41:32.800 --> 41:34.200
This saw really paid off.

41:34.233 --> 41:35.567
I got all this wood.

41:35.600 --> 41:37.800
A few days just in
one sled load there.

41:37.833 --> 41:39.500
I couldn't be happier.
This is awesome.

41:40.233 --> 41:41.667
Time to go stoke the fire.

41:44.367 --> 41:46.233
I've been wearing the same
clothes for more than a week.

41:46.267 --> 41:48.033
It's time to do some laundry.

41:49.433 --> 41:52.633
That's gonna heat up my water
right here.

41:56.600 --> 41:59.100
Boy, is it ever gonna be
nice to clean these
clothes up.

42:01.600 --> 42:02.667
Okay.

42:05.433 --> 42:07.200
I watched that sun
disappear over the mountain

42:07.233 --> 42:08.667
for the last time
this morning.

42:08.700 --> 42:10.467
It will be more than 100 days
before it comes back

42:10.500 --> 42:12.400
and shines on this camp again.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.467
The moon's coming up now.

42:21.967 --> 42:23.867
And in the wintertime,
that's what I depend on.

42:23.900 --> 42:26.200
I cycle a lot of my
activities around the moon.

42:28.333 --> 42:31.967
You can do a lot more outside
in the cold weather
than people realise.

42:33.500 --> 42:36.700
The sun's gone now, but I got
the moon up all winter long.

42:36.733 --> 42:38.567
And that moonlight's
what I rely on.

42:39.533 --> 42:40.700
There.

42:41.933 --> 42:43.400
It's all set. Good thing,

42:43.433 --> 42:45.067
cause my hands
are getting cold.
