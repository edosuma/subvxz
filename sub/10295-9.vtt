01:25.934 --> 01:27.834
Hi, Marce. Thanks.

01:27.869 --> 01:29.534
So I'm not crazy.

01:29.569 --> 01:31.133
You did just call and say,

01:31.168 --> 01:32.868
"Please bring over
your garbage"?

01:32.903 --> 01:35.434
Yeah. This'll save me
a lot of work.

01:35.469 --> 01:37.801
This garbage I'm making
doesn't smell.

01:39.367 --> 01:40.634
Yours doesn't either.

01:40.669 --> 01:44.033
Of course not.
We're vegetarian.

01:44.068 --> 01:45.534
Well, that's okay.

01:45.569 --> 01:49.033
I'll just add a pair
of Al's socks.

01:49.068 --> 01:51.033
Peggy, what
are you doing?

01:51.068 --> 01:52.901
I'm getting
myself a VCR.

01:54.534 --> 01:55.667
I see.

01:55.702 --> 01:56.968
No, you don't.

01:57.003 --> 01:58.567
You're not a housewife.

01:58.602 --> 02:00.067
You have your own money.

02:00.102 --> 02:02.000
I have to use strategy.

02:02.035 --> 02:03.667
You see,
when you first get married,

02:03.702 --> 02:05.567
you can withhold sex,

02:05.602 --> 02:08.067
but then they get
to like that,

02:08.102 --> 02:11.067
so you have to put
a little spin on the ball.

02:12.434 --> 02:14.567
You see, I have to
pretend to clean

02:14.602 --> 02:16.367
to remind Al
how hard my work is.

02:16.402 --> 02:18.701
He'll come in that door
any minute,

02:18.736 --> 02:20.634
sit down on the couch,

02:20.669 --> 02:22.567
put one hand
down his pants

02:22.602 --> 02:25.501
and the other hand here,
on this VCR ad.

02:25.536 --> 02:27.067
Excuse me, Peggy,

02:27.102 --> 02:30.133
but why don't you just say,
"Honey, I want a VCR"?

02:30.168 --> 02:32.601
Because Al works very hard
for his money,

02:32.636 --> 02:35.601
and he deserves me
to work equally as hard

02:35.636 --> 02:38.534
to get him
to spend it on me.

02:38.569 --> 02:41.534
To continue... He'll say,
"Why do we need a VCR?

02:41.569 --> 02:44.901
Because you want to watch Phil
and tape Oprah?" Ha!

02:46.534 --> 02:48.033
I mean, everyone knows

02:48.068 --> 02:50.868
that you watch Oprah
and tape Phil.

02:53.534 --> 02:55.033
Men. God love 'em.

02:55.068 --> 02:57.534
They're just children
with paychecks.

02:57.569 --> 03:00.033
So I'll grovel
for a while,

03:00.068 --> 03:01.901
and I'll get my VCR.

03:01.936 --> 03:04.100
But don't you find
this demeaning?

03:04.135 --> 03:07.701
Just the part where
I have to explain it to you.

03:09.102 --> 03:10.567
Ooh, there's his car.

03:10.602 --> 03:12.300
I better get going.

03:12.335 --> 03:13.701
Oh, no.
Stick around.

03:13.736 --> 03:17.267
You might lose your job someday
and have to be a woman.

03:22.801 --> 03:24.300
Oh, hi, honey.

03:24.335 --> 03:26.801
I didn't hear
you pull up.

03:26.836 --> 03:28.300
How was your day?

03:28.335 --> 03:30.300
I sell shoes, okay?

03:30.335 --> 03:32.167
Jeez, it stinks in here.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.467
Oh, well.
What's for dinner?

03:40.267 --> 03:41.267
What's this?

03:41.302 --> 03:42.767
Gee, I don't know.

03:42.802 --> 03:43.934
Let's see.

03:43.969 --> 03:45.434
Son of a gun.

03:45.469 --> 03:47.767
They're having
a sale on VCRs.

03:47.802 --> 03:49.267
What are those?

03:49.302 --> 03:50.767
Video Something
Recorders.

03:50.802 --> 03:53.367
That's a good price,
isn't it?

03:53.402 --> 03:54.567
It's not bad.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.701
You know, if we had
one of these,

03:56.736 --> 03:59.033
you could tape the Cubs game
while you were at work.

03:59.068 --> 04:01.767
Come on. You just want one
because Phil and Oprah

04:01.802 --> 04:04.267
are on at the same time,

04:04.302 --> 04:05.868
and it's killing you.

04:05.903 --> 04:08.767
Oh, please, Al.
Please, can I have one?

04:08.802 --> 04:09.934
Well...

04:09.969 --> 04:12.300
Stop, please!
I can't stand any more.

04:12.335 --> 04:14.801
Then maybe you should
go home. Please, Al.

04:14.836 --> 04:16.367
Al, this is so simple.

04:16.402 --> 04:17.801
Peggy wants a VCR,

04:17.836 --> 04:19.733
but she's afraid
you'll say no.

04:19.769 --> 04:21.666
Then she's smarter than you.

04:23.033 --> 04:25.801
Peggy, you don't have
to stand for this.

04:25.836 --> 04:29.234
It is the tragedy of our times
that a housewife has to beg

04:29.269 --> 04:30.801
for what
she's entitled to.

04:30.836 --> 04:34.801
Just because Peggy Bundy's
contribution is in the home

04:34.836 --> 04:36.534
doesn't mean
it's any less valuable

04:36.569 --> 04:38.133
than Al Bundy's
in the workplace.

04:38.168 --> 04:40.267
You can't have
a VCR.

04:41.567 --> 04:45.100
What gives you the right
to make that decision?

04:45.135 --> 04:48.133
Because the name
on this check says Al Bumby.

04:49.601 --> 04:51.100
Al Bumby?

04:51.135 --> 04:52.601
Well, that's not important.

04:52.636 --> 04:55.601
What's important is
that I can cash it... maybe...

04:55.636 --> 04:57.100
because I earned it,

04:57.135 --> 04:58.501
and that's the bottom line.

04:59.702 --> 05:01.000
I'll get the door,

05:01.035 --> 05:03.467
and when I get back, Al,
we'll discuss this

05:03.502 --> 05:05.300
while I spit-shine
your shoes.

05:06.434 --> 05:08.367
Oh, hi, Steve.
Hi, Peggy.

05:08.402 --> 05:11.100
<i>Honey, I just wanted to tell you
This Old House is coming on.</i>

05:11.135 --> 05:13.033
Bob's gonna test
for a septic tank.

05:13.068 --> 05:16.601
Just a second, Steve.
I'm settling an argument here.

05:16.636 --> 05:21.200
Al is a cheap, sexist, primitive
throwback of a human being.

05:21.235 --> 05:23.234
So, what's the argument?

05:24.968 --> 05:27.968
Peggy, if Al doesn't appreciate
your contributions,

05:28.003 --> 05:29.701
then it's time
to take them elsewhere.

05:29.736 --> 05:32.467
You want a VCR,
I have the solution.

05:32.502 --> 05:34.567
You're going
to get a job.

05:39.067 --> 05:41.267
She's not getting a job.

05:41.302 --> 05:43.968
You know, Al, it's probably
none of my business,

05:44.003 --> 05:46.100
but there are advantages
to having a working wife.

05:46.135 --> 05:48.100
For one thing,
it gave us enough money

05:48.135 --> 05:50.467
to buy the house
next to yours.

05:50.502 --> 05:52.667
No, wait,
that's a disadvantage.

05:52.702 --> 05:54.067
But there are some advantages.

05:54.102 --> 05:56.400
Like what?
You tell him, Al.

05:56.435 --> 05:58.734
Well, for one thing, you'll have
two paychecks coming in.

05:58.769 --> 06:00.200
It sure helps around bill time.

06:00.235 --> 06:01.367
I don't care.

06:01.402 --> 06:03.567
In the history
of the Bundy family,

06:03.602 --> 06:05.067
no wife has ever worked

06:05.102 --> 06:07.467
outside or inside
the home.

06:08.601 --> 06:10.667
I'm not about to change.

06:10.702 --> 06:12.133
Think of Peggy.

06:12.168 --> 06:14.434
What, do you think she
wants to sit around all day

06:14.469 --> 06:15.634
just watching TV?

06:17.934 --> 06:20.601
Women aren't
like that anymore.

06:20.636 --> 06:23.601
You know, I talked
with a customer today

06:23.636 --> 06:26.367
who had a job that would
be perfect for Peggy.

06:26.402 --> 06:29.300
Oh, gee, guys.
I already have a job.

06:29.335 --> 06:30.801
My family needs me.

06:30.836 --> 06:33.634
Kelly, honey, you want me
to make you some dinner?

06:33.669 --> 06:35.634
Oh, no, Mom. I'm gonna eat
at Joanie's house.

06:35.669 --> 06:37.434
Her mom makes
homemade stuff.

06:37.469 --> 06:38.834
Oh. Well, be careful.

06:38.869 --> 06:41.067
You never know
what they put in that.

06:42.968 --> 06:45.467
15 is the most
crucial age of all.

06:45.502 --> 06:47.300
You really have to
keep after them.

06:47.335 --> 06:49.801
Oh, and, Bud, my baby.

06:49.836 --> 06:51.801
Excuse me,
but I promised Bud

06:51.836 --> 06:53.601
I'd help him
with his homework.

06:53.636 --> 06:55.167
It's all done, Mom.

06:55.202 --> 06:56.901
Oh, and I wrote that letter
for you

06:56.936 --> 06:59.133
to get you
out of jury duty.

06:59.168 --> 07:01.133
Well, you must be tired.

07:01.168 --> 07:02.701
Do you want something to eat?

07:02.736 --> 07:05.467
No thanks. I don't have time
to cook right now, Mom.

07:07.601 --> 07:10.601
Peggy, the kids
are obviously old enough

07:10.636 --> 07:12.601
to take care
of themselves.

07:12.636 --> 07:14.601
And Al, well,
he'll learn.

07:14.636 --> 07:17.601
Just put an L and an R
on each of his shoes,

07:17.636 --> 07:20.300
and he should be fine.

07:20.335 --> 07:21.834
Careful, Steve.

07:21.869 --> 07:24.934
Someone's gonna steal
this one away.

07:24.969 --> 07:28.267
I think we're overlooking
the most important thing.

07:28.302 --> 07:29.767
And that is,
what does Peggy want?

07:29.802 --> 07:31.801
Yes. What does
Peggy want?

07:31.836 --> 07:33.300
I want a VCR.

07:33.335 --> 07:35.834
And the only way
to get it

07:35.869 --> 07:37.300
and feel good
about yourself

07:37.335 --> 07:39.300
is to get this job.

07:39.335 --> 07:42.167
You do want to work,
don't you?

07:44.634 --> 07:46.133
Then it's settled.

07:46.168 --> 07:47.634
I'm so excited.

07:47.669 --> 07:49.834
I can't wait to go home
and call about the job.

07:49.869 --> 07:51.300
Come on, Steve.

07:51.335 --> 07:53.100
Welcome to
the work force, Peg.

08:00.400 --> 08:01.901
Now, remember, kids,

08:01.936 --> 08:03.901
this is your mother's
first day at work.

08:03.936 --> 08:05.934
She's probably a little nervous,
a little insecure.

08:05.969 --> 08:07.767
So when she comes down
those stairs,

08:07.802 --> 08:09.934
I want everyone to stand
behind her like a family.

08:09.969 --> 08:11.601
Try not to laugh.

08:16.934 --> 08:19.801
Hi, Al. Came to pick Peggy
up for work.

08:22.868 --> 08:25.467
Well, how do I look?

08:28.100 --> 08:29.567
You look great.

08:29.602 --> 08:30.567
Fabulous.

08:30.602 --> 08:31.567
Super.

08:31.602 --> 08:32.567
Fabulous.

08:32.602 --> 08:33.567
Groovy.

08:33.602 --> 08:34.601
Fabulous.

08:34.635 --> 08:36.100
That's enough.

08:36.135 --> 08:39.366
All right, Peg.
A few words of advice.

08:39.402 --> 08:41.667
As soon as you walk
out that door,

08:41.702 --> 08:43.067
you'll feel
a warm sensation

08:43.102 --> 08:44.634
on your head
and shoulders.

08:44.669 --> 08:47.501
Don't panic. That's just
our friend, the sun.

08:50.968 --> 08:53.968
And Al, if you should feel
a sudden sharp pain

08:54.003 --> 08:55.467
where you sit,

08:55.502 --> 08:58.334
that's just your friend,
my foot.

09:00.300 --> 09:02.467
Come on, Peggy.
You're gonna love this.

09:02.502 --> 09:04.033
You're gonna
come home tonight

09:04.068 --> 09:05.734
with a real sense
of accomplishment.

09:05.769 --> 09:06.868
Yeah, you're right.

09:06.903 --> 09:08.601
I've been cooped up
in this house

09:08.636 --> 09:10.167
much too long.

09:10.202 --> 09:12.801
It's time to say goodbye
and move on.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.501
Goodbye, Bud.

09:16.536 --> 09:19.200
Mom, please,
you're a strong woman.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.501
Goodbye, Kelly.

09:22.536 --> 09:23.868
Mom, my hair.

09:31.667 --> 09:34.200
Well, Al,
I'm off to work.

09:36.501 --> 09:39.367
Thank you, Al.
You have a good day too.

09:39.402 --> 09:40.834
Don't worry, Peggy,
it'll be fine.

09:40.869 --> 09:43.167
It's gonna be
a great job,

09:43.202 --> 09:44.701
and you'll
be surprised

09:44.736 --> 09:47.067
at just how quickly
the day goes by.

10:15.167 --> 10:17.167
Do you have any clocks?

10:17.202 --> 10:18.901
No.

10:24.367 --> 10:26.367
Oprah's doing
a whole week

10:26.402 --> 10:27.467
on "Transsexuals:

10:27.502 --> 10:29.367
Which bathroom
should they use?"

10:29.402 --> 10:31.367
Really?
Phil's doing a show

10:31.402 --> 10:34.367
on "Male Potency:
A thing of the past."

10:34.402 --> 10:37.367
You know,
nowadays

10:37.402 --> 10:38.701
you really need
a VCR.

10:38.736 --> 10:40.601
Yeah.
Let's buy one.

10:40.636 --> 10:42.067
Let's get two.

10:44.534 --> 10:47.033
Oh, hello. I'm Mr. Pond.
Ernst Pond.

10:47.068 --> 10:49.033
I'm one
of your superiors.

10:49.068 --> 10:51.167
You have many.
Now, let's see...

10:51.202 --> 10:53.567
is it Miss Bundy
or Mrs.?

10:53.602 --> 10:54.567
Ms.

10:54.602 --> 10:56.100
Ah. Then it's Miss.

10:56.135 --> 10:57.400
It's Mrs.

10:57.435 --> 10:58.501
Hey, look.

10:58.536 --> 11:00.400
Do you have any openings
in the TV department?

11:00.435 --> 11:03.067
You just
don't start in TV.

11:03.102 --> 11:04.567
You rise to it.

11:04.602 --> 11:07.567
Besides, we prefer to put men
in the TV department.

11:07.602 --> 11:10.300
We find women tend
to waste a lot of time

11:10.335 --> 11:12.133
watching Oprah.

11:12.168 --> 11:14.667
Or is it Phil?
I get them confused.

11:14.702 --> 11:17.667
Hey, did you love
that training film?

11:17.702 --> 11:20.234
<i>Muldin's:
The First 100 Years.</i>

11:20.269 --> 11:24.200
How in the world did you get
William Shatner to narrate?

11:24.235 --> 11:25.834
We gave him a VCR.

11:27.701 --> 11:30.200
Didn't you love
that aerial shot

11:30.235 --> 11:33.701
of all the employees spelling
out the name Muldin's?

11:33.736 --> 11:36.701
Yeah. Wasn't it the top
of your head I saw

11:36.736 --> 11:38.067
dotting the I?

11:39.367 --> 11:40.868
It was.

11:40.903 --> 11:43.667
Now I leave you
to your happy task, Mrs. Bundy

11:43.702 --> 11:45.067
And don't forget.

11:45.102 --> 11:46.367
Tomorrow is daylight
savings time

11:46.402 --> 11:49.367
so you have to reset
all the clocks.

11:49.402 --> 11:50.734
Have a Muldin's day.

11:56.868 --> 12:00.200
<i>And 1 and 2
and 3 and 4.</i>

12:00.235 --> 12:04.367
<i>On your back
and 2 and 3 and 4.</i>

12:04.402 --> 12:08.801
<i>Like a dog
and 2 and 3 and 4.</i>

12:15.234 --> 12:16.234
Hi, Bud.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.234
Hi, Mom.

12:17.269 --> 12:20.100
So how was your
first day at work?

12:20.135 --> 12:22.667
Much like my first day
as a mother.

12:22.702 --> 12:24.234
Where's your sister?

12:24.269 --> 12:26.067
Kelly!

12:26.102 --> 12:27.934
Mom's home.

12:27.969 --> 12:30.901
Mom!

12:30.936 --> 12:35.434
Oh. I missed you
so much.

12:42.634 --> 12:44.133
Well, I better go.

12:44.168 --> 12:45.367
I have someone
waiting for me.

12:45.402 --> 12:46.868
Can I have $5.00?

12:46.903 --> 12:48.067
Yeah.

12:50.033 --> 12:51.067
Thanks, Mom.

12:57.701 --> 12:59.234
Where's your daddy?

12:59.269 --> 13:00.534
He went out in the garage.

13:00.569 --> 13:03.367
What did he make you
for dinner?

13:03.402 --> 13:04.334
Marshmallows.

13:05.901 --> 13:07.734
Well, where's the dog?

13:07.769 --> 13:09.334
He's out
barfing marshmallows.

13:09.369 --> 13:12.734
It looks like winter
out there.

13:12.769 --> 13:14.167
Go clean it up.

13:14.202 --> 13:15.200
Right, Mom.

13:21.834 --> 13:23.334
You look beat.

13:23.369 --> 13:25.534
Fix me some dinner, okay?

13:26.634 --> 13:28.667
Forget it, Al.
I'm too tired.

13:28.702 --> 13:30.167
Well, I'm tired too,

13:30.202 --> 13:33.000
but I made dinner
for the kids.

13:33.035 --> 13:34.334
Marshmallows, Al?

13:34.369 --> 13:36.667
Hey, we
toasted them, Peg.

13:36.702 --> 13:38.133
I am not cooking
dinner, Al.

13:38.168 --> 13:39.434
I work now.

13:39.469 --> 13:40.968
And I'm glad that you do.

13:41.003 --> 13:42.968
Because now that you're
bringing in some extra money,

13:43.003 --> 13:44.567
we can get
some stuff we need.

13:44.602 --> 13:45.801
New bike for Bud,

13:45.836 --> 13:47.300
a tutor for Kelly,

13:47.335 --> 13:49.701
and maybe some
fishing gear for me.

13:49.736 --> 13:52.467
Hey, wait a minute, Al.
What about my VCR?

13:52.502 --> 13:54.467
This is my money
we're talking about now.

13:54.502 --> 13:57.467
How come when I make it,
it's our money,

13:57.502 --> 13:59.968
but when you make it,
it's your money?

14:00.003 --> 14:02.300
Well, we'll leave that
to the historians.

14:02.335 --> 14:04.634
But in the meantime,
anything you make is our money,

14:04.669 --> 14:06.300
and we're getting
fishing gear.

14:06.335 --> 14:07.901
I don't want fishing gear.

14:07.936 --> 14:10.801
Hey, I didn't want new clothes
for the kids,

14:10.836 --> 14:12.334
but I gave in.

14:12.369 --> 14:14.334
And what's good
for the goose

14:14.369 --> 14:16.834
is good for
the goose's wife.

14:16.869 --> 14:18.167
Great to be working
isn't it?

14:19.536 --> 14:21.200
Get the door, Al.
I work now.

14:21.235 --> 14:22.767
You get the door.
I work too.

14:22.802 --> 14:23.934
I got home last.

14:23.969 --> 14:25.300
I work longer.

14:25.335 --> 14:27.868
Then you should be used to it.
Now, go see who it is.

14:33.334 --> 14:34.367
It's Marcie.

14:41.767 --> 14:43.934
Hi, Peggy.
How was your first day at work?

14:43.969 --> 14:45.467
I hate working.

14:45.502 --> 14:47.334
That's why
I got married.

14:48.801 --> 14:51.300
And now I'm not even
getting a VCR.

14:51.335 --> 14:53.801
Oh, the kids are getting
what they want.

14:53.836 --> 14:55.801
Al's getting
what he wants.

14:55.836 --> 14:56.968
But me? Hmph.

14:57.003 --> 14:59.934
I miss Phil.
I miss Oprah.

14:59.969 --> 15:02.367
I miss my empty life.

15:03.534 --> 15:04.868
Congratulations,
Peggy.

15:04.903 --> 15:08.167
You've learned what it is
to be a woman of today.

15:08.202 --> 15:09.667
The freedom to make
your own choices.

15:09.702 --> 15:11.167
You tried work.

15:11.202 --> 15:12.501
You hate it.

15:12.536 --> 15:14.000
Now you can
choose to quit.

15:14.035 --> 15:15.501
No, I can't.

15:15.536 --> 15:17.000
You see,
Al comes home every day,

15:17.035 --> 15:20.868
and if I ask him
to do something for me

15:20.903 --> 15:22.200
or to me,

15:22.235 --> 15:25.033
he says he's
too tired from work.

15:25.068 --> 15:26.534
So if I quit,

15:26.569 --> 15:28.734
then he'll know that I know
that work is hard.

15:28.769 --> 15:29.934
And that'll be the end

15:29.969 --> 15:32.601
of any fun
I'll have in our marriage.

15:32.636 --> 15:34.601
No. The only way out

15:34.636 --> 15:37.300
is to get Al
to make me quit.

15:37.335 --> 15:39.534
Then you're gonna
keep the job?

15:39.569 --> 15:41.033
I have to.

15:41.068 --> 15:43.367
Well, I meant
what's best for you.

15:43.402 --> 15:45.300
I think it'll
work out fine.

15:45.335 --> 15:47.634
And don't think I don't
appreciate it, Marcie.

15:57.334 --> 15:58.667
Hello, Pizza Shack?

15:58.702 --> 16:01.667
I'd like 15 of your
Gutbucket pizzas

16:01.702 --> 16:03.534
delivered to
Marcie Rhoades.

16:05.834 --> 16:08.334
Oh, free garlic bread
with every order?

16:08.369 --> 16:10.634
No, thanks.
We'll pay for it.

16:14.667 --> 16:17.400
Okay, kids!
Marshmallows are ready!

16:21.834 --> 16:23.334
Marshmallows again?

16:23.369 --> 16:24.834
They're fresh today,

16:24.869 --> 16:27.367
we don't
have to toast them,

16:27.402 --> 16:30.067
and they're on a bun.

16:32.734 --> 16:34.634
Dad,
it's been a week.

16:34.669 --> 16:36.200
Why don't you just
break down

16:36.235 --> 16:38.367
and go to the supermarket
and buy some actual food?

16:38.402 --> 16:40.701
You know, the kind
Mom used to defrost.

16:40.736 --> 16:41.868
No.

16:41.903 --> 16:43.367
I hate the supermarket.

16:43.402 --> 16:47.367
I always wind up in the
2000 Items or Less aisle

16:47.402 --> 16:50.868
behind some ugly lady
in a muumuu and curlers.

16:50.903 --> 16:52.868
And when everything
is totaled up,

16:52.903 --> 16:54.367
<i>then they go for
the checkbook,</i>

16:54.402 --> 16:57.000
like it never occurred to them
that they have to pay.

16:57.035 --> 16:58.400
And then they always
turn around

16:58.435 --> 16:59.701
and ask me,
"What's the date?"

16:59.736 --> 17:01.234
Like it matters to me.

17:01.269 --> 17:04.367
All they gotta do is look
at the date on their milk.

17:04.402 --> 17:06.733
and add one.

17:06.769 --> 17:09.733
Come on. Let's have
some enthusiasm here.

17:09.769 --> 17:11.901
Campfire burgers
for everybody.

17:11.935 --> 17:14.334
Buck! Dinner!

17:15.901 --> 17:17.901
Where is
that stupid dog?

17:19.035 --> 17:20.400
Come in!

17:20.435 --> 17:23.901
Al, you know your dog just
jumped the fence into my yard?

17:23.935 --> 17:26.267
He's coughing up
little white puffs.

17:28.400 --> 17:31.267
All right, then,
there's more for us, eh, kids?

17:33.934 --> 17:36.434
All right.
Go get him back.

17:36.469 --> 17:37.767
How, Dad?

17:37.802 --> 17:40.434
Well, I was saving this
chocolate bar for me,

17:40.469 --> 17:42.067
but he is
the family dog.

17:42.102 --> 17:43.501
Don't give it to him.

17:43.536 --> 17:45.200
Just draw him
with the scent.

17:45.235 --> 17:48.067
Go on. It's the only protein
in the house.

17:54.868 --> 17:58.234
That's all right.
I got 15 more pizzas at home.

18:01.868 --> 18:03.534
So, Al...

18:03.569 --> 18:05.968
How's Peggy's new job
working out?

18:06.003 --> 18:07.400
Oh, great, Steve.

18:07.435 --> 18:10.400
Yeah, she's pulling in
a clear 90 bucks a week.

18:10.435 --> 18:13.400
Of course she's spending
400 bucks a week.

18:13.435 --> 18:15.434
Yeah, she needed
a new smock at Muldin's,

18:15.469 --> 18:17.901
then, of course,
she needed some new clothes.

18:17.936 --> 18:19.567
And then she wanted
some new shoes.

18:19.602 --> 18:21.968
Well, that's no problem.
You sell shoes.

18:22.003 --> 18:24.734
No, she wanted
good shoes.

18:24.769 --> 18:26.334
So the way I figure it,

18:26.369 --> 18:27.834
if she keeps working
any longer,

18:27.869 --> 18:29.701
we'll all be living
in the gutter.

18:29.736 --> 18:31.601
Actually, I won't
be living in the gutter.

18:31.636 --> 18:35.234
I'll be in prison
for killing your wife.

18:35.269 --> 18:39.434
Well, before you go down
that long, lonesome road, Al,

18:39.469 --> 18:41.434
why don't you
try this?

18:41.469 --> 18:42.934
Ask Peggy to quit.

18:42.969 --> 18:44.367
No, I can't do that.

18:44.402 --> 18:48.033
See, the truth is,
I like having her at home.

18:48.068 --> 18:49.934
Well, she'd love
to hear that.

18:49.969 --> 18:51.434
Yeah, I'm sure
she would,

18:51.469 --> 18:53.434
but I'm not
gonna tell her.

18:53.469 --> 18:57.200
Because then I'd have
nothing to complain about,

18:57.235 --> 18:58.634
and I love complaining.

18:58.669 --> 19:00.133
No, if I got her to quit,

19:00.168 --> 19:02.701
she'd lord it over me
for the rest of my life.

19:02.736 --> 19:05.200
She'd say, "I wanted to work,
but you want me home,

19:05.235 --> 19:07.133
so now I'm home,
so shut up!"

19:07.168 --> 19:11.767
And that would be the end
of all my fun in the marriage.

19:11.802 --> 19:13.968
No, I gotta think
of another way.

19:14.003 --> 19:15.133
Ah, gee, Al,

19:15.168 --> 19:16.801
I don't like to butt
into your business-

19:16.836 --> 19:19.167
No, go ahead.
Pretend you're your wife.

19:23.133 --> 19:26.901
Okay. I think you have
to take into consideration

19:26.936 --> 19:28.467
what's best for Peggy.

19:28.502 --> 19:30.033
Why would I do that?

19:44.133 --> 19:47.167
Oh, hi, hon. I didn't
hear you come in.

19:47.202 --> 19:51.434
Gee, you made it all the way
to the couch this time.

19:51.469 --> 19:53.434
How's work?
Are you still enjoying it?

19:53.469 --> 19:54.767
What's that noise?

19:54.802 --> 19:55.934
What noise?

19:55.969 --> 19:57.300
I hear ticking.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.767
Oh...it's you.

20:03.802 --> 20:04.634
Me?

20:08.767 --> 20:12.267
I'll tell you an interesting
thing about this watch, Peg.

20:12.302 --> 20:15.267
You put it in water,
you ruin it.

20:15.302 --> 20:18.300
Is there anything
you want to tell me, Peg?

20:18.335 --> 20:21.133
No. Anything you
want to tell me?

20:21.168 --> 20:22.300
No.

20:23.634 --> 20:26.801
Oh, the dog
has the runs.

20:26.836 --> 20:29.801
Are you gonna do
any housework tonight, Peg?

20:29.836 --> 20:31.801
I have a job, Al.

20:31.836 --> 20:34.300
Unless you want me
to quit.

20:34.335 --> 20:35.300
No.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.300
Unless you want
to quit.

20:37.335 --> 20:40.300
Well, then, I guess
we're both kind of happy, huh?

20:40.335 --> 20:41.167
Yep.

20:42.801 --> 20:44.067
Mom. Dad.

20:44.102 --> 20:47.200
There's something we have
to talk to you about.

20:47.235 --> 20:50.067
We really miss you
around the house, Mom.

20:50.102 --> 20:52.601
Yeah. No offense
to you, Dad,

20:52.636 --> 20:54.534
but we're starving
and we're dirty.

20:57.100 --> 21:00.200
I think we need you
to take care of us, Mom.

21:00.235 --> 21:01.868
I know we're at an age

21:01.903 --> 21:04.300
where we ought to be able
to take care of ourselves,

21:04.335 --> 21:05.801
but we can't.

21:05.836 --> 21:07.434
We want you
to quit your job.

21:07.469 --> 21:09.434
What do you
say, Peg?

21:09.469 --> 21:12.367
Well, the kids
have to come first.

21:13.701 --> 21:14.934
Okay.

21:14.969 --> 21:16.100
I'll quit.

21:16.135 --> 21:18.601
But only because
I love you.

21:18.636 --> 21:20.100
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

21:20.135 --> 21:21.434
You hear that, kids?

21:21.469 --> 21:23.634
Your mother
is quite a lady.

21:23.669 --> 21:25.634
Now, Peg, are you gonna
go shopping tomorrow

21:25.669 --> 21:26.667
and get some groceries?

21:26.702 --> 21:27.767
If I have time.

21:27.802 --> 21:29.667
What do you mean,
if you have time?

21:29.702 --> 21:30.901
You don't do
anything else.

21:30.936 --> 21:32.634
Okay, Al.
I'll go shopping.

21:32.669 --> 21:36.567
But if I do, I'll miss Phil,
and I'll miss Oprah

21:36.602 --> 21:37.968
and the Cubs game.

21:38.003 --> 21:39.467
But that's all right, Al.

21:39.502 --> 21:42.501
You'll get me a VCR
when you're ready.

21:43.968 --> 21:47.133
Are you ready, Al?
Please, please, please.

21:47.168 --> 21:50.567
Well, since you
put it like that...

21:50.602 --> 21:53.000
Sure. Why not?

21:53.035 --> 21:54.734
Hey, we can go
to Muldin's.

21:54.769 --> 21:57.901
We can still use
your employee discount.

21:57.936 --> 21:59.434
Oh, I don't
think so, Al.

21:59.469 --> 22:01.934
I think they're kind of
mad at me.

22:01.969 --> 22:04.601
I kind of damaged
some merchandise.

22:04.636 --> 22:07.601
That'll be a nice gift
for Steve and Marcie.

22:07.636 --> 22:08.467
Oh, yeah.

22:14.934 --> 22:16.434
Well, we did it.

22:16.469 --> 22:19.434
Yep. Does Mom know
Dad paid us?

22:19.469 --> 22:20.767
Nope.

22:20.802 --> 22:24.100
Dad know
Mom paid us?

22:24.135 --> 22:25.133
Nope.

22:26.767 --> 22:29.767
Does Mom know
about your phony ID?

22:29.802 --> 22:31.000
Nope.
