00:01.262 --> 00:02.654
Previously on
Supergirl...

00:02.698 --> 00:03.655
I'm sorry, who are you?

00:03.699 --> 00:04.743
Andrea Rojas.

00:04.787 --> 00:06.832
I sold CatCo
to Andrea.

00:06.876 --> 00:07.877
Tomorrow,
we'll be joined by

00:07.920 --> 00:09.096
the renowned
William Day.

00:09.139 --> 00:10.445
From
The Times of London?

00:10.488 --> 00:11.315
I quit.

00:11.359 --> 00:12.577
But I have a calling, Hope,

00:12.621 --> 00:14.318
and it's to fix mankind.

00:14.362 --> 00:16.146
I never thought Supergirl
would tell me who she was,

00:16.190 --> 00:18.366
but now that she has,
I have an opportunity,

00:18.409 --> 00:20.759
and I can use Supergirl
to achieve my ends.

00:22.805 --> 00:23.849
Who are you?

00:23.893 --> 00:26.591
You don't recognize me.
Brother.

00:34.077 --> 00:35.165
♪ Stop me on the corner

00:37.167 --> 00:38.212

01:06.762 --> 01:08.068
Thank you, Supergirl.

01:08.938 --> 01:10.331
Yeah.

01:10.374 --> 01:12.202
That woman shouldn't
have been texting and walking.

01:12.246 --> 01:14.291
...as citizens
of National City

01:14.335 --> 01:15.205
prepare to head
to the ballot box
for the upcoming midterms.

01:15.249 --> 01:17.294
Obsidian North contact lenses,

01:17.338 --> 01:19.122
they let you do you,

01:19.166 --> 01:22.386
whenever, wherever,
and whatever you want.

01:22.430 --> 01:23.431
Seriously?

01:27.217 --> 01:29.437
As if you weren't
amazing enough,

01:30.264 --> 01:31.700
you're also a gourmet chef?

01:31.743 --> 01:32.831
Hardly.

01:32.875 --> 01:35.138
But I am famous

01:35.182 --> 01:37.358
-for this breakfast
in particular.
-Oh.

01:37.401 --> 01:39.099
So, we have poached eggs,

01:39.142 --> 01:40.535
crispy bacon,

01:40.578 --> 01:42.014
fresh whipped cream,

01:42.058 --> 01:43.929
and...

01:43.973 --> 01:45.931
Danvers'
blueberry pancakes.

01:45.975 --> 01:47.672
-Um...
-I know, right?

01:47.716 --> 01:49.196
One bite of these

01:49.239 --> 01:51.589
and you will die for them.

01:51.633 --> 01:52.938
I really will.

01:52.982 --> 01:54.157
What's wrong?

01:54.201 --> 01:56.116
I'm not the biggest fan
of blueberries.

01:56.159 --> 01:58.466
-Oh!
-In fact, I'm deadly allergic.

01:58.857 --> 01:59.945
You are?

01:59.989 --> 02:01.251
When I was four,
I ate a handful of them,

02:01.295 --> 02:02.905
and my throat closed up,

02:02.948 --> 02:05.429
and my face probably turned
the color of those blueberries.

02:05.473 --> 02:06.256
Oh, my God.

02:06.300 --> 02:08.127
I... I am so sorry.

02:08.170 --> 02:09.172
It's okay. I was four.

02:09.216 --> 02:10.782
No, but I nearly
just killed you.

02:10.826 --> 02:12.306
Okay, you didn't
just kill me,

02:12.349 --> 02:14.656
and I always carry
an emergency EpiPen with me.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.223
Really?

02:16.266 --> 02:17.746
I didn't know that.

02:17.789 --> 02:19.139
Hey, it's all good.

02:19.182 --> 02:21.619
Also, bacon and whipped cream

02:21.663 --> 02:24.448
happen to be two of
my most favorite foods

02:24.492 --> 02:25.275
on the planet.

02:25.319 --> 02:26.755
So, you don't really like

02:26.798 --> 02:28.800
poached eggs either, do you?

02:28.844 --> 02:30.237
Not so much.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.761
But do you know
what I like more than anything?

02:32.804 --> 02:33.762
Mmm-mmm.

02:34.502 --> 02:35.546
You.

02:35.590 --> 02:36.895
Okay.

02:38.854 --> 02:39.855
Thank you.

02:39.898 --> 02:41.161
I need breakfast.

02:41.770 --> 02:42.771
And coffee.

02:42.814 --> 02:44.990
Yes, this is your pattern,

02:45.034 --> 02:47.167
which is why
I've prepared accordingly.

02:48.733 --> 02:50.170
Breakfast burritos!

02:50.779 --> 02:51.997
With chorizo and crema,

02:52.041 --> 02:53.564
as you like.

02:53.608 --> 02:56.132
Plus your nitro-coffee with
an extra shot of cold brew.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.178
This is
the best morning ever.

02:58.787 --> 02:59.875
"Best morning ever"?

03:00.963 --> 03:02.312
But that would include eons,

03:02.356 --> 03:05.315
both before and after
this moment.

03:05.359 --> 03:07.187
I really think
you're misusing the ter--

03:10.059 --> 03:11.321
Message received.

03:13.323 --> 03:15.586
I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

03:15.630 --> 03:19.286
Andrea bought CatCo
to get free global advertising

03:19.329 --> 03:20.200
for Obsidian North.

03:20.243 --> 03:21.201
And then this morning

03:21.244 --> 03:22.332
on the jumbotron

03:22.376 --> 03:24.769
an important story about
the election

03:24.813 --> 03:25.944
was swallowed up

03:25.988 --> 03:28.208
by a gigantic
Obsidian commercial.

03:28.251 --> 03:29.557
-It's...

03:29.600 --> 03:31.559
Well, speaking of
the upcoming election,

03:31.602 --> 03:33.256
I got some interesting news
last night.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.692
I got a call

03:34.736 --> 03:35.737
from a group of people

03:35.780 --> 03:37.521
who want to back me
for senator.

03:37.565 --> 03:38.653
Senator?

03:38.696 --> 03:40.089
-Yeah.
-That's incredible.

03:40.132 --> 03:42.091
I never imagined
going into politics.

03:42.134 --> 03:43.484
Are you kidding me?

03:43.527 --> 03:45.312
We would all be lucky
to have you in Washington.

03:45.355 --> 03:47.227
I also have an offer to be

03:47.270 --> 03:49.446
the media director
at the Smithsonian.

03:50.404 --> 03:51.709
Uh, so how long has it been

03:51.753 --> 03:54.843
since you left CatCo,
what, 12 hours? That's...

03:56.366 --> 03:58.455
That's the universe telling me
I'm on the right path.

03:58.499 --> 04:00.718
Uh, well, I think
the universe is just telling me

04:00.762 --> 04:02.807
that I have to keep
my spirits up

04:02.851 --> 04:04.592
and fight the good fight.

04:04.635 --> 04:06.463
Your spirits
do seem remarkably high

04:06.507 --> 04:09.074
for someone who strongly
dislikes her new boss.

04:09.118 --> 04:11.816
Well, that's thanks to Lena.

04:12.426 --> 04:13.427
I don't think I realized

04:13.470 --> 04:15.298
how burdened I was
by lying to her.

04:15.342 --> 04:17.257
And now that she knows
I'm Supergirl,

04:17.300 --> 04:18.475
and she's forgiven me,

04:18.519 --> 04:21.043
I feel 1,000 pounds lighter.

04:21.086 --> 04:22.479
Like I can do anything.

04:22.523 --> 04:23.524
Bring it!

04:24.351 --> 04:26.091
J'onn, we got you a latte.

04:27.310 --> 04:28.529
Oh, my God.

04:28.572 --> 04:29.443
J'onn?

04:29.878 --> 04:30.748
J'onn?

04:30.792 --> 04:31.967
-J'onn!

04:39.801 --> 04:43.283
Well, this should help
take away the pain temporarily.

04:43.326 --> 04:44.458
I don't understand.

04:44.501 --> 04:46.503
You think that
whoever did this to you

04:46.547 --> 04:48.592
was also the person
that released Midnight?

04:48.636 --> 04:49.680
Yes.

04:49.724 --> 04:52.553
He said
he was my brother.

04:52.596 --> 04:55.120
At first, I didn't believe him,
but now I know it must be true.

04:55.164 --> 04:56.731
How do you know?

04:56.774 --> 05:00.387
This is specifically
a Martian form of agony.

05:01.388 --> 05:02.563
In the early days of Mars,

05:02.606 --> 05:04.652
there were two brothers:
Phobos and Deimos.

05:05.435 --> 05:07.263
Their rivalry and bloodshed

05:07.307 --> 05:10.135
was the reason for
the split of the Green
and White Martians.

05:10.179 --> 05:12.660
To prevent this
ever happening again,

05:12.703 --> 05:14.966
a curse was placed on
the Green Martians.

05:16.054 --> 05:18.796
We called it Fa'ra'too'rik.

05:18.840 --> 05:21.059
It is the punishment for
brother attacking brother.

05:21.103 --> 05:23.888
But you've never even mentioned
having a brother.

05:23.932 --> 05:25.455
I never knew of one.

05:26.413 --> 05:28.502
Seems unthinkable.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.373
But perhaps his existence

05:30.417 --> 05:32.157
was hidden from me
by my parents.

05:32.201 --> 05:35.160
And hidden by
the entire Martian community
by their hive mind?

05:35.204 --> 05:36.379
We're going to find him,

05:36.423 --> 05:38.686
but first we need
to deal with your pain.

05:39.687 --> 05:41.863
There is no cure for this
on this planet.

05:42.646 --> 05:44.082
There is in the future.

05:45.214 --> 05:46.694
We treat afflicted Euphorians,

05:46.737 --> 05:50.132
an alien race with similar
brain structure to Martians,

05:50.175 --> 05:51.481
with Q-waves.

05:53.222 --> 05:54.397
They are narrow waveforms

05:54.441 --> 05:56.834
that exist between
X and gamma rays.

05:57.574 --> 05:58.836
You haven't heard of them

05:58.880 --> 06:00.185
because Q-waves
don't get discovered

06:00.229 --> 06:02.492
until sometime
in the late dark ages.

06:02.536 --> 06:05.147
Actually, Kelly's been
using Q-waves

06:05.190 --> 06:08.455
as part of her
brain computer interface
at Obsidian.

06:08.498 --> 06:11.414
Well, no time like the present
to create the future.

06:13.329 --> 06:14.678
Oh...

06:14.722 --> 06:15.940
Nia?

06:15.984 --> 06:17.202
Kara,

06:17.246 --> 06:18.508
you need
to get here immediately.

06:18.552 --> 06:20.380
Ms. Rojas is on a rampage,

06:20.423 --> 06:23.470
and she won't start
the editorial meeting
until everyone's present.

06:23.513 --> 06:25.385
I'm on my way.

06:25.428 --> 06:27.256
-You guys get J'onn to Kelly.
-Okay.

06:27.299 --> 06:28.562
And I'll have the DEO

06:28.605 --> 06:30.433
start a broadband scan
for Green Martians ASAP.

06:31.739 --> 06:32.870
J'onn,

06:32.914 --> 06:34.481
we're going to
find your brother.

06:37.135 --> 06:38.833
Who hurt you?

06:38.876 --> 06:40.617
I went to see my brother.

06:41.270 --> 06:42.706
He struck at me

06:42.750 --> 06:45.970
and inflicted us both with
the sting of Fa'ra'too'rik.

06:46.014 --> 06:48.408
I cannot cure your affliction,

06:48.451 --> 06:49.800
but I will do what I can

06:49.844 --> 06:51.933
to ease your suffering,
old friend.

06:51.976 --> 06:53.413
Once I am able,

06:53.456 --> 06:56.807
I will tear this new family
of J'onn J'onzz's apart,

06:56.851 --> 06:57.982
for both of us.

07:03.248 --> 07:04.641
Hope?

07:04.685 --> 07:06.164
Good morning,
Ms. Luthor.

07:06.208 --> 07:07.078
Is it morning?

07:08.166 --> 07:09.603
I lost track of time.

07:11.692 --> 07:12.780
I had an epiphany last night.

07:12.823 --> 07:14.434
There's something
in these lenses

07:14.477 --> 07:16.044
of the Obsidian technology

07:16.087 --> 07:18.307
that's going to allow me
to change the course
of humanity.

07:18.350 --> 07:20.440
That is
an exciting agenda.

07:20.483 --> 07:22.616
What is
your scientific hypothesis?

07:23.312 --> 07:24.966
Hope, could you hurt someone?

07:25.009 --> 07:26.881
I am incapable
of causing pain.

07:26.924 --> 07:28.839
It is against
my prime directive.

07:28.883 --> 07:30.406
Exactly.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.321
Because you were built
in the very image
of perfection.

07:32.364 --> 07:34.062
You have
no selfish inclinations.

07:34.105 --> 07:37.979
Your base code is morality,
empathy, and logic.

07:38.022 --> 07:41.548
Humans and aliens,
however, are flawed.

07:41.591 --> 07:43.506
They are driven
by their emotions.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.377
They lie, cheat,

07:45.421 --> 07:47.292
and hurt each other
to protect themselves.

07:47.336 --> 07:48.293
But it's not their fault,

07:48.337 --> 07:49.904
it's just
how they're programed.

07:50.687 --> 07:52.341
I am going to make them better

07:52.384 --> 07:54.082
with Project Non Nocere.

07:54.125 --> 07:55.518
Do no harm.

07:55.562 --> 07:56.867
I'm going to rid humanity

07:56.911 --> 07:58.565
of its instincts
to hurt each other.

07:58.608 --> 08:01.437
But you cannot reprogram
organic creatures.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.873
The VR lenses create a link

08:02.917 --> 08:05.354
between what we want
and what we see,

08:05.397 --> 08:07.356
constructing a blank slate
in the brain

08:07.399 --> 08:09.706
on which
a new world can be projected.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.839
If I can find the source
of that link,

08:11.882 --> 08:15.407
I can redirect the blank slate
to have one single rule.

08:15.451 --> 08:17.366
Non Nocere.Do no harm.

08:17.409 --> 08:20.500
Is there anything I can do
to assist you in this endeavor?

08:20.543 --> 08:21.631
You will eventually,

08:21.675 --> 08:23.067
but right now,
I need more resources.

08:24.329 --> 08:26.070
The subject
is gaining consciousness.

08:27.245 --> 08:28.508
Good.

08:28.551 --> 08:29.770
I'm ready for her.

08:37.429 --> 08:38.561
How did you sleep?

08:44.001 --> 08:45.350
Kara!

08:45.394 --> 08:47.222
Nia. There you are.

08:47.265 --> 08:48.658
We can finally get started.

08:54.011 --> 08:54.838
What's this?

08:54.882 --> 08:56.884
A gift! From Obsidian North.

08:57.319 --> 08:58.407
From now on

08:58.450 --> 09:00.540
all work will be filed
through a portal

09:00.583 --> 09:02.629
only accessible
through these tablets.

09:02.672 --> 09:04.282
Thanks, boss.

09:04.326 --> 09:05.762
At The Timeswe were lucky
if we got a legal pad.

09:05.806 --> 09:08.069
Didn't you say
your wife was a lawyer?

09:08.112 --> 09:10.506
Shouldn't you have a house
filled with legal pads?

09:10.550 --> 09:11.812
Yeah. Right.

09:11.855 --> 09:13.901
Which just makes this
all the more special.

09:15.076 --> 09:17.078
Now,
for writing assignments,

09:17.121 --> 09:18.732
I need interesting takes.

09:18.775 --> 09:19.602
Kara,

09:19.646 --> 09:20.647
you're on the fashion beat.

09:20.690 --> 09:24.041
Um... That's not
really my style.

09:24.085 --> 09:25.260
Style? Cute.

09:25.303 --> 09:26.566
You're witty.

09:26.609 --> 09:27.871
I thought it would be
meta for you to cover

09:27.915 --> 09:30.221
the "Who wore what?"
to your Pulitzer party.

09:30.265 --> 09:32.659
I think I'd actually
prefer to do something
a little more...

09:32.702 --> 09:34.661
Elitist? Yes, we all know that

09:34.704 --> 09:36.706
you can do
highbrow journalism.

09:36.750 --> 09:39.883
I want to see
how low you can go.

09:39.927 --> 09:41.493
It'll be good for you
to stretch that muscle.

09:41.537 --> 09:43.757
Well, I'm always looking
to stretch my craft.

09:44.453 --> 09:45.759
In fact, I, uh...

09:45.802 --> 09:47.630
I may have a beat on
a new senate candidate.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.110
Maybe I can get us
an exclusive,

09:49.153 --> 09:51.634
have them announce
their race on our website.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.114
That is a good story.

09:53.723 --> 09:54.811
So, you know what I think?

09:54.855 --> 09:56.683
I think you should do both.

09:56.726 --> 09:57.814
But mine first.

09:57.858 --> 09:59.686
And I want it on my desk
by lunch.

10:00.077 --> 10:01.470
Thank you.

10:01.513 --> 10:03.341
Um... I actually don't know
if I have time, but...

10:07.476 --> 10:08.651
Here you go.

10:10.174 --> 10:11.959
Okay, we're gonna go slow.

10:12.002 --> 10:14.048
And I'm going to be here
monitoring your brain activity

10:14.091 --> 10:15.615
and your vitals
the whole time.

10:15.658 --> 10:17.617
And James is right outside,
if we need anything.

10:17.660 --> 10:18.835
All right.

10:26.495 --> 10:28.628
-Initiating energy cycle.

10:29.977 --> 10:31.979
Q-wave protocol initiated.

10:35.765 --> 10:38.942
Please... Please let me go.

10:38.986 --> 10:41.771
I know that you're mad at me,
but just know that

10:41.815 --> 10:45.557
I would be the most loyal
to you, if you let me live.

10:45.601 --> 10:46.863
Okay, I'm not mad at you.

10:46.907 --> 10:48.735
-Then why am I here?
-Why did you betray me?

10:48.778 --> 10:52.434
I swear I didn't want to,
and that's true. It's just...

10:54.349 --> 10:58.092
-They made me do it.
-Who is they? Lex's cronies?

10:58.135 --> 10:59.920
I can't.

10:59.963 --> 11:02.662
-They're everywhere.
-All right.

11:02.705 --> 11:04.359
Blame the bogeyman.

11:04.402 --> 11:06.927
Please, if they even think that
I told you, they will kill me,

11:06.970 --> 11:08.450
and they will kill you too.

11:08.493 --> 11:09.799
Why should I believe
anything you say?

11:09.843 --> 11:11.148
Because it's true.

11:12.933 --> 11:15.326
They recruited me
when I was 16.

11:16.023 --> 11:17.328
Same year my parents died.

11:18.199 --> 11:19.504
I was already in college.

11:19.548 --> 11:20.854
I had so much debt.

11:22.072 --> 11:23.508
They said
they could fix everything.

11:23.552 --> 11:25.336
All I had to do
was work for them.

11:25.380 --> 11:26.860
-And betray me.
-No!

11:26.903 --> 11:29.558
I hated doing it.
It hurt me every time.

11:29.601 --> 11:31.038
Eve, I asked you
a question.

11:31.691 --> 11:32.692
My mother always said

11:32.735 --> 11:34.302
actions speak
louder than words.

11:34.345 --> 11:36.217
And I was there, Eve.

11:36.260 --> 11:38.001
I was on the other side
of that gun you pulled,

11:38.045 --> 11:39.176
and I looked down the barrel,

11:39.220 --> 11:41.178
and I knew,
that you would've shot me.

11:42.179 --> 11:44.747
So don't tell me
that you didn't have a choice.

11:45.879 --> 11:47.663
There is always a choice,

11:47.707 --> 11:50.187
and you always chose
the same thing.

11:50.231 --> 11:52.973
You betrayed me
because you wanted to.

11:53.016 --> 11:54.714
You liked the power
that it gave you.

11:54.757 --> 11:57.412
So, if you want me
to trust you,

11:59.109 --> 12:01.111
try telling the truth for once.

12:08.989 --> 12:10.904
Hey, Alex, I'm so sorry.

12:10.947 --> 12:12.209
I think I'm stuck here

12:12.253 --> 12:13.776
until I'm done
with these assignments.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.473
Andrea's been
all over me today.

12:15.517 --> 12:19.303
But the second you get a hit,
I'll blow out of here. Okay.

12:22.263 --> 12:23.177
Nia?

12:23.525 --> 12:24.482
Hey!

12:25.092 --> 12:26.049
Whoa.

12:26.093 --> 12:28.182
You have a bento box fort.

12:28.225 --> 12:29.009
Yup, yeah, I do.

12:29.052 --> 12:30.271
-Can I have some?
-Yes!

12:30.314 --> 12:31.794
-I'm starving
-Yes, please, take them all.

12:31.838 --> 12:34.014
I'm still stuffed
from breakfast.

12:34.057 --> 12:35.493
Let me guess. Is this Brainy?

12:35.537 --> 12:37.757
This morning, he brought me
my favorite breakfast,

12:37.800 --> 12:39.497
and it was perfect.

12:40.847 --> 12:43.284
I don't know,
isn't this a little excessive?

12:43.327 --> 12:47.331
Maybe giving food
is Brainy's language
of love. I don't know.

12:47.375 --> 12:49.769
Well, I think
I just need to tell him
in plain English

12:49.812 --> 12:52.989
that this is 35 boxes of sushi
too much love.

12:53.033 --> 12:54.556
Yeah, that sounds
like a very healthy

12:54.599 --> 12:55.862
and mature thing to do.

12:55.905 --> 12:57.341
But I'm going to enjoy this
while it lasts.

12:57.385 --> 12:58.473
All right. Well...

13:02.607 --> 13:03.695
Great.

13:03.739 --> 13:05.523
More reason
to get this done quickly.

13:10.311 --> 13:12.792
I just reconfigured
all possible energy signatures

13:12.835 --> 13:14.228
based on J'onn's DNA.

13:14.271 --> 13:16.534
Mmm. You really are
on top of it all, Brainy.

13:17.318 --> 13:18.580
I really am, aren't I?

13:18.623 --> 13:19.973
I began this morning

13:20.016 --> 13:22.105
by executing
a perfect breakfast
for Nia Nal.

13:22.149 --> 13:25.456
She called it
"the best morning ever."

13:25.500 --> 13:26.631
And as of 10 minutes ago,

13:26.675 --> 13:28.764
she's having
an even better afternoon.

13:28.808 --> 13:29.896
She is welcome.

13:29.939 --> 13:31.549
You see, the key
to a good relationship

13:31.593 --> 13:33.290
is knowing each other fully.

13:33.334 --> 13:36.163
Hmm, I don't know
if that's really true.

13:36.206 --> 13:38.556
Your voice just went up
two octaves.

13:39.079 --> 13:40.384
Is everything all right?

13:42.865 --> 13:44.040
Everything is great.

13:45.520 --> 13:48.828
Except I almost kind of
poisoned Kelly this morning,

13:48.871 --> 13:50.481
but it was
just a silly mistake.

13:50.525 --> 13:51.918
Sounds like a deadly mistake.

13:54.224 --> 13:56.531
I didn't know
she was allergic
to blueberries.

13:56.574 --> 13:57.662
Okay?

13:57.706 --> 13:59.577
How could I?
She never told me that.

13:59.621 --> 14:00.840
And then I started thinking,

14:00.883 --> 14:02.842
"Okay, well, what else
hasn't she told me?

14:02.885 --> 14:05.322
What else might I
accidently kill her with?"

14:05.366 --> 14:08.543
Because
I really like her, Brainy,

14:08.586 --> 14:10.675
like, like a lot.

14:10.719 --> 14:12.416
And I don't want to kill her.

14:12.460 --> 14:15.202
You and Kelly are still in the
"getting to know you" stage.

14:15.245 --> 14:17.073
Okay, but that's what
I'm talking about.

14:17.117 --> 14:19.075
When did this happen?

14:19.119 --> 14:21.817
When did my feelings for Kelly
get so strong,

14:21.861 --> 14:23.732
and how could I possibly
feel this way

14:23.775 --> 14:25.908
about somebody
that I barely know?

14:26.822 --> 14:28.780
From what I've learned,

14:28.824 --> 14:30.478
the heart

14:30.521 --> 14:31.653
is not logical.

14:34.264 --> 14:38.486
Okay, we're going to
40 biohertz now.

14:38.529 --> 14:40.488
Q-wave protocol initiated.

14:43.621 --> 14:45.145
Turn it off.

14:45.710 --> 14:46.929
What's going on?

14:47.930 --> 14:49.932
Pain has just got worse.

14:52.108 --> 14:53.893
Oh, there's something off
on your scan.

14:55.764 --> 14:56.983
Okay, part of what
this tech does

14:57.026 --> 14:59.202
is it maps and catalogs
your memories.

14:59.246 --> 15:02.727
Okay, these rings represent
every year of your life.

15:02.771 --> 15:04.381
Think of them like tree rings.

15:05.034 --> 15:07.254
You see these? They're broken.

15:07.297 --> 15:10.866
Have you ever had illness
or brain trauma before?

15:10.910 --> 15:13.129
I've had many battles.

15:13.173 --> 15:15.175
Didn't you also inherit
Myr'nn's memories?

15:15.218 --> 15:17.481
Maybe that's causing
a rift in your own?

15:17.525 --> 15:19.570
Okay. We should
rule out everything.

15:20.397 --> 15:21.442
And if you want,

15:21.485 --> 15:22.922
we can further
explore the breaks.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.053
It might help us figure out

15:24.097 --> 15:25.185
a better way
to stop your pain.

15:25.228 --> 15:26.751
Whatever you think will help.

15:26.795 --> 15:28.405
Okay.

15:28.449 --> 15:29.624
I'm gonna go in with him,

15:29.667 --> 15:31.495
make sure nobody
interrupts us.

15:31.539 --> 15:32.496
-Got it.
-Okay.

15:37.675 --> 15:39.025
Ready?

15:39.068 --> 15:40.635
Initiating...

15:40.678 --> 15:43.551
Pushing to 60 biohertz now.

15:45.379 --> 15:47.250
First, we build.

15:47.294 --> 15:50.036
I find it's easiest
for patients to create a method

15:50.079 --> 15:52.212
for organizing their memories.

15:52.255 --> 15:54.127
Imagine somewhere familiar.

16:06.008 --> 16:08.793
You see how some of
these spines are blank?

16:08.837 --> 16:11.318
This must have been the breaks
that I saw on the scan.

16:14.669 --> 16:17.889
Battle of L'Zoril M'nt.

16:17.933 --> 16:19.674
Battle of C'arel.

16:21.154 --> 16:24.026
These are battles
of the Martian Civil War.

16:28.030 --> 16:29.597
There's something about...

16:30.772 --> 16:31.991
this one.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.661
I've never seen this before.

16:52.837 --> 16:54.013
It's Martian.

17:06.676 --> 17:08.723
What do you think
that void means?

17:08.766 --> 17:10.768
Someone wiped my mind.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.953
I just located J'onn's brother,

17:21.997 --> 17:23.520
five miles from here.

17:23.564 --> 17:25.044
Great.
Get everyone out there,

17:25.087 --> 17:26.393
I'll call Supergirl.

17:37.317 --> 17:38.100
Hey...

17:40.668 --> 17:41.756
Alex. Hey.

17:44.802 --> 17:46.108
Sure. I just...

17:46.717 --> 17:48.023
It's him?

17:48.067 --> 17:51.418
Don't make contact with him
until I'm there.

17:51.461 --> 17:53.333
Yeah. I'll sneak out of here
and meet you.

17:56.031 --> 17:57.076
Where you going?

17:57.119 --> 17:58.686
Everything okay?

17:58.729 --> 18:00.209
It's a family emergency.

18:07.651 --> 18:08.739
Hey.

18:08.783 --> 18:10.698
I know the NSA
doesn't do this anymore,

18:10.741 --> 18:12.569
but you owe me a favor.

18:12.613 --> 18:14.702
I need you to track
someone in National City.

18:15.616 --> 18:17.052
Last name Danvers,

18:17.096 --> 18:18.271
first name Kara.

18:27.193 --> 18:29.673
Glad to see you've escaped
your tower, Rapunzel.

18:29.717 --> 18:31.632
Yeah, and into a sewer.

18:31.675 --> 18:32.937
Where's J'onn's brother?

18:35.157 --> 18:36.593
Who would mind-wipe you?

18:36.637 --> 18:38.726
Only another Martian
would be strong enough.

18:40.293 --> 18:41.511
But wiping a Martian's mind

18:41.555 --> 18:44.384
is the greatest sin
in Martian culture.

18:44.427 --> 18:47.126
Well, we could
rebuild your memory

18:47.169 --> 18:49.476
based on what you already know.

18:49.519 --> 18:51.782
Repairing the break
could also help ease your pain.

18:51.826 --> 18:54.829
I'm not sure I can face
what's inside that void.

18:55.438 --> 18:56.613
J'onn...

18:57.745 --> 18:59.007
I... I know

18:59.050 --> 19:01.009
that looking into your past
can be terrifying.

19:01.052 --> 19:02.445
When I did it,

19:02.489 --> 19:04.230
I thought I might
lose myself for good.

19:04.273 --> 19:05.840
But Kelly was right by my side,

19:07.407 --> 19:08.886
and I came back stronger.

19:12.194 --> 19:13.717
Give me those contacts.

19:18.853 --> 19:21.160
Brainy,
are we close
to J'onn's brother?

19:22.683 --> 19:25.207
There seems to be interference
with the signal.

19:26.121 --> 19:27.514
What kind of interference?

19:29.820 --> 19:31.170
It's unclear.

19:35.043 --> 19:36.871
There's something else
in here too.

19:40.875 --> 19:43.486
Are you sure
this is where Kara Danvers is?

19:43.530 --> 19:44.922
Yep. That's where she is.

19:54.018 --> 19:55.368
What are you doing here?

19:56.064 --> 19:57.239
Get out! Now!

20:00.808 --> 20:03.680
Remember, this world
is a construct.

20:04.507 --> 20:06.814
Nothing in here is by accident.

20:08.946 --> 20:11.210
The book
that led you to the void,

20:11.253 --> 20:13.386
you said it was about
the Martian Civil War?

20:13.429 --> 20:15.910
It was the darkest moment
in Martian history.

20:17.999 --> 20:19.914
In fact, it ended our history.

20:22.612 --> 20:24.310
The White Martians attacked us,

20:25.528 --> 20:27.574
sabotaging us on every front.

20:28.966 --> 20:30.446
Including our minds.

20:33.841 --> 20:35.582
How did they sabotage you?

20:36.365 --> 20:38.237
I don't know.

20:39.586 --> 20:40.543
Yes, you do.

20:46.419 --> 20:47.637
That's him.

20:51.380 --> 20:52.729
Don't hurt them.

20:55.950 --> 20:57.647
My brother was a traitor.

20:59.345 --> 21:02.304
He poisoned us
with H'ronmeer's Curse.

21:02.348 --> 21:04.741
We went before
the High Council.

21:04.785 --> 21:06.308
Malefic betrayed us,

21:06.352 --> 21:09.224
worked with the White Martians to poison our people.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.617
He is not one of us.

21:10.660 --> 21:12.923
Send him to the Phantom Zone.

21:23.630 --> 21:25.632
You are still in the dark,
Brother.

21:28.635 --> 21:30.680
Q-wave protocol completed.

21:30.724 --> 21:31.594
The pain...

21:34.815 --> 21:35.772
It's gone.

21:38.471 --> 21:39.776
Thank you, Brother.

21:52.006 --> 21:53.921
Alex, watch out.
It's J'onn's brother.

21:53.964 --> 21:54.835
No!

22:03.365 --> 22:05.062
He's gone.

22:10.981 --> 22:12.635
That was Kelly on the phone.

22:12.679 --> 22:14.376
J'onn's okay. His pain is gone.

22:14.420 --> 22:15.421
Well, that's a relief.

22:15.464 --> 22:16.770
Are you finding anything?

22:16.813 --> 22:18.119
Negative.

22:18.162 --> 22:19.468
I lost his signal
when he and the White Martian

22:19.512 --> 22:20.774
phased out of the sewer.

22:20.817 --> 22:22.297
I will reconfigure
his signature

22:22.341 --> 22:25.126
to include both Green
and White Martian energy.

22:25.169 --> 22:26.867
Great, then we'll
get back to the DEO.

22:26.910 --> 22:28.347
-Wow! I'm sorry.
-What?

22:28.390 --> 22:30.479
-You smell.

22:30.523 --> 22:32.351
But you smell of sewer.

22:33.482 --> 22:35.441
Maybe a change of clothes
could help.

22:35.702 --> 22:36.616
Wow.

22:36.659 --> 22:37.965
He's not wrong about the smell.

22:38.008 --> 22:39.575
Okay. Well, y'all smell, too.
How about that?

22:39.619 --> 22:41.403
Worry not, the work is handled.

22:46.843 --> 22:48.758
-Oh, hey, Nia. What is it?

22:48.802 --> 22:52.371
Kara, Ms. Rojas is furious.
Where are you?

22:52.414 --> 22:53.589
On my way.

22:54.590 --> 22:55.504
I'll stay with J'onn tonight,

22:55.548 --> 22:56.679
in case his brother comes back.

22:56.723 --> 22:58.420
But I have to do
some damage control

22:58.464 --> 22:59.987
-at CatCo first.
-Okay.

23:11.477 --> 23:13.435
Kara. It's after lunch,

23:13.479 --> 23:15.481
and I haven't even received
your first article yet.

23:15.524 --> 23:16.917
I was just about to file that.

23:16.960 --> 23:18.222
William already did.

23:18.266 --> 23:19.833
He wrote my article?

23:19.876 --> 23:20.877
And it's excellent,

23:20.921 --> 23:22.401
I may add.

23:22.444 --> 23:24.751
Perhaps the transition is
harder on you than I thought.

23:24.794 --> 23:27.231
Our copy editing staff
is a little shorthanded.

23:27.275 --> 23:29.495
Maybe you can help them out.

23:29.538 --> 23:32.367
I'm... I'm not a copy editor.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.891
A beginner's mind
is a Zen mind.

23:39.766 --> 23:40.984
Really?

23:41.028 --> 23:42.072
Broken?

23:42.116 --> 23:43.596
Intentionally?

23:43.639 --> 23:45.206
And you're certain
it's that user?

23:46.555 --> 23:47.774
I'll handle it.

23:51.255 --> 23:52.953
The pile on the right
is for you.

24:00.656 --> 24:03.267
Don't ever steal
one of my stories again.

24:03.311 --> 24:04.443
Hey, I did you a favor.

24:04.486 --> 24:06.575
Yeah? What kind of
twisted logic is it

24:06.619 --> 24:09.622
that makes you think that
by stealing one of my bylines
you're doing me a favor?

24:09.665 --> 24:11.885
And tattling on me?
What are you, five?

24:11.928 --> 24:14.670
Maybe if you focused
on the work actually
assigned to you,

24:14.714 --> 24:16.150
you wouldn't have this problem.

24:16.193 --> 24:18.935
Well, maybe if you supported
your fellow journalists

24:18.979 --> 24:22.939
instead of competing with them
you wouldn't be such a jerk.

24:22.983 --> 24:25.812
Do I look like a guy
who does charity?

24:25.855 --> 24:27.901
You want someone
to look out for you?

24:27.944 --> 24:29.206
Look somewhere else.

24:29.250 --> 24:31.295
Well, since you enjoy
doing my work so much,

24:31.339 --> 24:32.471
have at it.

24:35.822 --> 24:37.519
I've been thinking about
what you said.

24:38.259 --> 24:39.478
You're right.

24:40.174 --> 24:42.002
I wasn't motivated by fear

24:42.045 --> 24:43.612
or blackmail.

24:43.656 --> 24:46.485
Every decision that I made,

24:46.528 --> 24:48.574
every crummy thing
that I did to you,

24:48.617 --> 24:51.664
to everyone, I wanted to do it.

24:52.360 --> 24:54.188
I liked doing it.

24:54.231 --> 24:55.232
Lena.

24:58.584 --> 25:01.108
Andrea? How did
you get down here?

25:01.630 --> 25:03.545
Oh, your assistant

25:03.589 --> 25:05.547
is my best friend's girlfriend.

25:06.069 --> 25:07.027
Cute couple.

25:07.070 --> 25:08.855
Surprised you didn't know.

25:08.898 --> 25:10.857
You shouldn't
underestimate me, Lena.

25:11.466 --> 25:12.946
Do you really think

25:12.989 --> 25:15.035
that I don't know when someone
is trying to steal my IP?

25:16.384 --> 25:18.081
You put trackers in the lenses.

25:18.125 --> 25:19.213
And you shattered it,

25:19.909 --> 25:22.346
along with
the Lumus pixellator.

25:22.390 --> 25:24.610
But you already knew that.

25:24.653 --> 25:26.742
That's what you were trying
to anatomize, wasn't it?

25:27.917 --> 25:31.181
You know, I really thought
more of you, Lena.

25:32.400 --> 25:35.272
Caught trying to steal
my technology?

25:36.622 --> 25:37.971
How embarrassing for you.

25:39.015 --> 25:41.540
What would
your shareholders think?

25:41.583 --> 25:42.889
Or the world?

25:44.151 --> 25:48.547
Oh, and I ran diagnostics
before you...

25:48.590 --> 25:49.896
shattered these.

25:50.897 --> 25:53.552
I know how valuable
they are to you.

25:53.595 --> 25:55.162
How many hours
you've spent in them.

25:56.380 --> 25:57.817
You're cut off.

25:57.860 --> 25:59.775
You won't get
another pair from me.

26:00.559 --> 26:01.777
Keep screwing with me,

26:01.821 --> 26:04.563
and you won't
just owe me a story.

26:04.606 --> 26:06.129
You'll be the story.

26:12.962 --> 26:13.920
Lena.

26:14.703 --> 26:16.139
I could have called for help,

26:16.183 --> 26:17.750
and all of this would have been
over in one minute.

26:18.185 --> 26:19.490
But I didn't.

26:19.534 --> 26:20.883
Because I meant what I said.

26:21.971 --> 26:23.277
You can trust me.

26:25.888 --> 26:26.846
Yes,

26:28.238 --> 26:29.326
it appears that I can.

26:32.591 --> 26:35.594
No matter how I reconfigure
the Green Martian
energy signature,

26:35.637 --> 26:38.597
I cannot get a hit
besides J'onn J'onzz himself.

26:41.295 --> 26:42.252
Thank you.

26:45.212 --> 26:46.256
Nia!

26:46.300 --> 26:48.258
You are welcome.

26:48.302 --> 26:51.000
I assume you received
the pizza delivery.

26:51.348 --> 26:52.436
Thank you

26:52.480 --> 26:53.916
for the pizzas

26:53.960 --> 26:55.788
but my dress is bursting
at the seams,

26:55.831 --> 26:57.441
and I'm pretty sure
I have heartburn.

26:57.485 --> 27:00.619
Hmm, yes. My heart also burns.

27:00.662 --> 27:02.882
You're not listening to me.

27:02.925 --> 27:05.798
But this morning you said,
"I love this."

27:05.841 --> 27:08.322
Remember "Best morning ever"?

27:08.365 --> 27:09.889
I... I did, I do.

27:09.932 --> 27:11.847
I just...
I appreciate all the stuff

27:11.891 --> 27:13.457
you're doing to make me happy.

27:13.501 --> 27:15.851
But I love lots of things.

27:15.895 --> 27:17.461
I love...

27:17.505 --> 27:19.289
stupid buddy comedies

27:19.333 --> 27:20.508
and Taylor Swift,

27:20.551 --> 27:23.032
and quiet nights,

27:23.076 --> 27:24.686
and poetry,

27:24.730 --> 27:27.776
and just spending time
with you.

27:27.820 --> 27:29.473
I love that, too.

27:29.517 --> 27:31.084
So you'll chill on the food?

27:31.127 --> 27:32.128
Indeed.

27:33.390 --> 27:34.435
But just to be clear,

27:34.478 --> 27:36.655
chill doesn't mean
you want gelato

27:36.698 --> 27:39.745
or a nice chilled
shrimp cocktail, correct?

27:39.788 --> 27:42.138
No more food. Hot or cold.

27:47.840 --> 27:50.190
I'm sorry about
your brother.

27:50.233 --> 27:51.582
Here.

27:51.626 --> 27:53.410
Thank you.

27:55.064 --> 27:56.892
Knowing now
that I am tied to someone

27:56.936 --> 27:59.112
who betrayed my people
so violently

27:59.155 --> 28:01.114
is, uh, unsettling.

28:02.376 --> 28:03.899
And it makes me worry.

28:03.943 --> 28:05.640
If this memory
was taken from me,

28:05.684 --> 28:07.642
what else might I not know
about myself,

28:07.686 --> 28:08.730
good or bad?

28:08.774 --> 28:10.036
Well, you have us,

28:10.558 --> 28:11.690
and we know you.

28:12.125 --> 28:13.300
Thank you.

28:13.343 --> 28:15.563
And I appreciate you
letting me be here.

28:15.606 --> 28:16.825
But shouldn't you be working?

28:16.869 --> 28:18.914
Oh, please.
You are a welcome distraction.

28:18.958 --> 28:20.699
Andrea is gunning for me,

28:20.742 --> 28:22.875
and that William guy...

28:22.918 --> 28:24.398
I mean,
who does he think he is?

28:24.964 --> 28:27.053
I caught him following me.

28:27.749 --> 28:28.750
Following you?

28:28.794 --> 28:29.751
Did you confront him?

28:29.795 --> 28:31.448
No. I couldn't.
I was Supergirl.

28:32.232 --> 28:35.539
But he is sneaky.

28:35.583 --> 28:37.585
And I think
he's trying to sabotage me.

28:37.628 --> 28:38.934
He just rattles
around the office

28:38.978 --> 28:41.545
with his smug
British accent. And...

28:41.589 --> 28:43.069
You know who I feel bad for?

28:43.112 --> 28:43.983
His wife,

28:44.026 --> 28:45.462
'cause she's stuck with him.

28:47.290 --> 28:48.683
J'onn, I don't know
how much longer

28:48.727 --> 28:50.119
I can last at CatCo.

28:51.164 --> 28:53.775
The Kara Danvers I know
is not a quitter.

28:53.819 --> 28:55.211
If someone's trying to
sabotage you,

28:55.255 --> 28:56.691
you just ignore them.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.127
They're spending
all their energy on you,

28:58.171 --> 29:00.434
you spend yours
on being the best you.

29:21.107 --> 29:22.412
Kelly? Hey!

29:23.152 --> 29:24.763
Did I leave the door unlocked?

29:25.111 --> 29:26.155
Yep.

29:26.199 --> 29:27.417
Oh, geez.

29:27.461 --> 29:28.810
Uh, I'm gonna put on
a sweater real quick.

29:28.854 --> 29:29.942
You open the wine.

29:35.817 --> 29:36.992
To a successful day.

29:37.036 --> 29:39.299
Ugh.
To an exhausting day.

29:43.564 --> 29:44.826
And, um...

29:46.219 --> 29:48.787
Thank you so much
for helping J'onn.

29:48.830 --> 29:50.963
You really are
a miracle worker.

29:51.572 --> 29:52.878
It was nothing.

29:53.443 --> 29:55.184
You're the real hero.

29:55.228 --> 29:56.969
Almost catching
J'onn's brother.

29:58.318 --> 30:01.669
I feel like I barely understand
what you guys do.

30:01.712 --> 30:03.802
How did you
manage to track him?

30:07.240 --> 30:08.284
You know what...

30:10.330 --> 30:11.897
Let's not order in.

30:11.940 --> 30:13.072
I still have some of that

30:13.115 --> 30:14.595
blueberry pancakes batter
in the fridge,

30:14.638 --> 30:16.292
so how about I whip
some of those up?

30:17.337 --> 30:18.425
Sounds good.

30:25.998 --> 30:27.521
You're not my girlfriend.

30:29.001 --> 30:30.611
You killed my comrade.

30:33.005 --> 30:35.007
-It's Alex.

30:35.921 --> 30:37.183
She's in trouble.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.015
We gotta go.

30:43.580 --> 30:44.538
Alex?

30:53.068 --> 30:54.548
Hey, I got your signal.

30:54.591 --> 30:55.941
Is everything okay?

30:55.984 --> 30:57.856
Yeah, I'm fine.

30:57.899 --> 30:59.553
Oh, I must have just bumped it.

31:04.036 --> 31:05.298
What did you do with Alex?

31:05.602 --> 31:06.865
Oh...

31:06.908 --> 31:08.997
Humans are so fragile,
aren't they?

31:16.744 --> 31:18.267
That wasn't very nice.

31:48.210 --> 31:50.082
I got this.
You go get my brother.

32:01.397 --> 32:02.964
I'm going to help those people.

32:04.313 --> 32:06.054
Why are Alex
and Supergirl fighting?

32:06.098 --> 32:07.969
That's not Alex,
that's my brother.

32:08.013 --> 32:09.449
Alex may still be inside.

32:09.492 --> 32:11.016
I'm gonna go find her.

32:11.059 --> 32:12.669
- Move,
move, move, move!

32:12.713 --> 32:14.323
Let's go! Let's go!

32:14.715 --> 32:15.716
Alex?

32:17.283 --> 32:18.197
Alex?

32:22.070 --> 32:23.550
Alex, wake up.

32:23.593 --> 32:25.160
-Wake up, Alex.

32:25.204 --> 32:27.684
-Don't touch me.
-Hey, it's me. It's me.

32:30.818 --> 32:32.037
It's you. Okay.

32:33.386 --> 32:34.300
It's you.

32:35.301 --> 32:36.128
Okay.

32:36.171 --> 32:37.433
We have to get out of here.

32:37.825 --> 32:39.000
We gotta go.

32:39.609 --> 32:41.220
Okay.

32:41.263 --> 32:42.786
Wait. There's a fire
in the stairwell.

32:42.830 --> 32:43.918
I barely made it up here.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.485
Okay. We can get out
through the roof.

32:45.833 --> 32:47.052
Okay, go.

32:48.227 --> 32:49.968
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

33:21.086 --> 33:22.478
Alex, it's me.

33:23.044 --> 33:24.350
Alex, listen to me.

33:25.264 --> 33:27.135
Just hold us both here
until help comes.

33:27.179 --> 33:28.745
No. He's just trying to escape.

33:30.704 --> 33:31.661
Shoot him.

33:38.277 --> 33:39.147
No!

33:39.756 --> 33:40.757
No.

33:54.423 --> 33:55.859
Well, the building's all right.

33:55.903 --> 33:57.296
Everything's sound.

33:57.339 --> 33:59.472
But I can't speak
for your reputation

33:59.515 --> 34:00.734
with your neighbors

34:00.777 --> 34:03.563
or Mr. Nelson's
melted pint of Rocky Road.

34:04.216 --> 34:05.391
So, that was your brother,

34:05.434 --> 34:06.392
the traitor?

34:06.435 --> 34:07.436
Yes.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.047
I'm afraid
this is far from over.

34:09.786 --> 34:10.831
When our minds were joined,

34:10.873 --> 34:13.442
Malefic said
I was still in the dark.

34:13.485 --> 34:16.663
Perhaps if I could access
more of my memories,

34:16.706 --> 34:19.405
I might be able to uncover
what his next move will be.

34:21.146 --> 34:22.712
Kelly, do you think
we could go deeper

34:22.755 --> 34:23.931
with Obsidian's tech?

34:23.974 --> 34:27.239
Perhaps turn the energy
up to 80 biohertz?

34:27.282 --> 34:29.545
That kind of power
could reset your brain

34:29.589 --> 34:30.590
for good.

34:31.330 --> 34:32.635
We can't take that chance.

34:33.984 --> 34:35.116
All right.

34:44.952 --> 34:46.127
William?

34:46.780 --> 34:48.042
You're here late.

34:48.085 --> 34:49.565
Working on a new
extracurricular story?

34:49.609 --> 34:51.610
No. Actually, I'm just here
to do my job.

34:53.699 --> 34:55.092
That's a nice change.

34:57.573 --> 34:59.445
You know what?

34:59.488 --> 35:00.576
I see you.

35:01.534 --> 35:03.144
You're a saboteur.

35:03.188 --> 35:05.320
You bring other people down
to make you look better.

35:05.364 --> 35:07.279
And maybe that's how
you've made it this far,

35:07.322 --> 35:09.933
but that's a rotten way
of making it to the top.

35:09.977 --> 35:11.674
So you can try
to get me in trouble

35:11.718 --> 35:13.111
and steal my stories,

35:13.154 --> 35:14.938
but while you're busy plotting
and undermining me,

35:14.982 --> 35:18.246
I'm going to be doing my job,
with heart and integrity,

35:18.290 --> 35:19.682
and I'm gonna be doing it well.

35:26.211 --> 35:29.127
Nothing says sorry
for the terror like cookies.

35:30.606 --> 35:31.390
Oh, hey,

35:31.433 --> 35:33.305
I got you a little gift.

35:33.696 --> 35:35.133
Oh!

35:35.176 --> 35:37.613
So this
is the list of my allergies.

35:37.657 --> 35:39.876
Blueberries, hazelnuts,
bees, and cats.

35:41.530 --> 35:43.271
This is very helpful.
Thank you.

35:43.315 --> 35:44.838
You're welcome.

35:44.881 --> 35:46.100
You know, I...

35:46.144 --> 35:49.234
I realized that my spiral

35:49.277 --> 35:50.626
this morning
about the blueberries

35:50.670 --> 35:53.977
wasn't really about
the blueberries.

35:54.021 --> 35:55.153
What do you mean?

35:55.196 --> 35:57.198
We haven't been together
for very long,

35:57.242 --> 35:59.157
so, you know,
it just made me realize

35:59.200 --> 36:02.377
how much we still don't know
about each other.

36:02.421 --> 36:05.032
And, you know, I really

36:05.075 --> 36:08.166
frickin' like you like a lot.

36:08.209 --> 36:09.993
And so...

36:10.037 --> 36:11.386
That scared me.

36:11.430 --> 36:13.127
Alex, you're safe with me.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.824
I know that now.

36:14.868 --> 36:17.349
Earlier when I...
When I touched her hand,

36:18.263 --> 36:20.178
I knew that wasn't you.

36:20.221 --> 36:22.180
Because you can't fake
how that feels.

36:22.223 --> 36:25.139
Just like you can't fake
being who you are.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.359
So, on that rooftop,

36:28.316 --> 36:31.232
when you made
that very selfless choice,

36:31.276 --> 36:34.017
I knew exactly in that moment

36:34.061 --> 36:36.194
which one of you was my Kelly.

36:36.237 --> 36:37.673
And I might not know

36:37.717 --> 36:40.241
every little detail
about you yet,

36:41.329 --> 36:42.678
but I know you.

36:43.244 --> 36:44.289
Aw!

36:44.332 --> 36:46.639
-So sweet.
-Isn't it?

37:00.957 --> 37:02.263
- Dearest, Nia...

37:04.265 --> 37:07.355
"Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?"

37:07.964 --> 37:09.401
Brainy, wha...

37:11.229 --> 37:12.926
Why are you doing all this?

37:12.969 --> 37:15.189
Nia, I heard you
loud and clear.

37:15.233 --> 37:18.323
From now on I will shower you
with poetry.

37:18.801 --> 37:19.889
Oh!

37:19.933 --> 37:21.891
Have no fear.

37:21.935 --> 37:25.504
Even without spicy tuna,
I will venture to make each day

37:26.374 --> 37:28.333
the best day ever.

37:29.595 --> 37:31.423
Which is theoretically
impossible.

37:31.771 --> 37:32.772
But...

37:34.643 --> 37:37.603
you make me want to do
the impossible.

37:38.691 --> 37:40.649
Brainy you are

37:41.041 --> 37:42.303
adorable.

37:43.304 --> 37:45.959
But sometimes
you are the dumbest

37:46.002 --> 37:47.613
smartest person I know.

37:49.702 --> 37:50.746
Thank you.

38:00.452 --> 38:01.583
Eve, I've decided
that it's time

38:01.627 --> 38:03.368
to fill you in on
what I've been doing.

38:11.680 --> 38:14.770
You will not
regret this, Ms. Luthor.

38:14.814 --> 38:16.076
You can count on me.

38:16.119 --> 38:17.469
For real this time.

38:18.208 --> 38:19.688
I must admit, I had my doubts.

38:21.342 --> 38:22.561
But now I know that

38:22.604 --> 38:24.302
there are aspects
of your brain that I need.

38:24.345 --> 38:26.042
And now that I know
that I can trust you,

38:27.261 --> 38:28.436
I believe you and I
are going to do

38:28.480 --> 38:29.655
great things together.

38:32.179 --> 38:33.354
Eve,

38:34.094 --> 38:35.965
meet Hope.

38:36.009 --> 38:37.967
You two are going to be
working closely together.

38:39.665 --> 38:40.666
How so?

38:42.232 --> 38:43.843
Well, first, Eve,

38:43.886 --> 38:45.235
we need to evolve you,

38:45.279 --> 38:47.412
and you yourself said that
you wanted to be better.

38:47.455 --> 38:49.501
I promise you,
you will not feel a thing.

38:54.114 --> 38:55.724
You've been mapping my mind?

38:55.768 --> 38:57.552
I needed to locate
and highlight

38:57.596 --> 38:58.597
the centers of your brain

38:58.640 --> 39:00.338
that trigger
honesty and loyalty.

39:00.860 --> 39:01.861
Why?

39:03.123 --> 39:04.516
So Hope knows where to go.

39:24.187 --> 39:28.366
"I didn't develop
a sense of smell
until the tender age of 14."

39:57.438 --> 39:58.961
Kara, have you finished
editing, yet?

39:59.005 --> 40:00.485
I have.

40:00.528 --> 40:02.748
I also sent you 11 pitches
ahead of tomorrow's meeting,

40:02.791 --> 40:05.446
all with eye-grabbing headlines
and image options.

40:06.882 --> 40:07.796
Well,

40:09.058 --> 40:10.930
I look forward
to discussing them tomorrow.

40:11.931 --> 40:12.888
Don't be late.

40:54.713 --> 40:56.454
Without the powers
that were stolen from me

40:56.497 --> 40:58.020
in the Phantom Zone,

40:58.064 --> 40:59.544
the power to incept,

40:59.587 --> 41:01.937
there's no way I can defeat
my brother and his friends.

41:01.981 --> 41:03.852
You listen,
but you do not hear.

41:03.896 --> 41:05.898
That woman gave you the answer.

41:07.029 --> 41:07.987
That kind of power

41:08.030 --> 41:09.510
could reset your brain
for good.

41:10.598 --> 41:12.078
Reset your brain.

41:12.992 --> 41:14.123
Reset your brain.

41:26.701 --> 41:27.528
Hope?

41:27.572 --> 41:29.574
Good morning, Ms. Luthor.

41:29.617 --> 41:31.358
Since Andrea Rojas
took my lenses,

41:31.401 --> 41:32.968
we need a new plan.

41:33.012 --> 41:34.535
Luckily she confirmed
my hypothesis

41:34.579 --> 41:36.537
about the interworking
of her technology.

41:37.538 --> 41:38.670
This pleases you.

41:39.409 --> 41:40.976
We don't need Andrea's tech.

41:41.020 --> 41:43.675
With your help,
I can build my own.

41:44.589 --> 41:46.678
And together
we can rebuild humanity.
