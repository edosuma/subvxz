01:25.084 --> 01:26.143
<i>Hello?</i>

01:26.219 --> 01:27.777
- You still asleep?
- <i>No, I'm not...</i>

01:27.854 --> 01:29.378
Get up. I'm outside.

01:29.522 --> 01:31.080
<i>Why? What time is it?</i>

01:31.157 --> 01:33.523
It's time to go.
Come on, hurry up.
You're late.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.839
- Hey.
- Hi!

01:53.480 --> 01:55.414
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.

01:55.482 --> 01:57.416
- Good morning.
- Morning.

01:57.984 --> 01:59.508
Nice pj's.

02:12.699 --> 02:13.688
Let's go.

02:13.766 --> 02:14.755
We're going.

02:45.965 --> 02:47.626
I know that look.

02:49.335 --> 02:51.030
You got to pee.

02:51.104 --> 02:52.196
No, I don't.

02:54.974 --> 02:56.566
Yeah, okay. Yeah, I do.

02:56.976 --> 02:58.068
Babe, we just left.

02:58.144 --> 02:59.168
I know. I'm sorry.

02:59.245 --> 03:00.576
We haven't even been
six blocks.

03:00.647 --> 03:02.444
Well, I got to go.

03:03.550 --> 03:04.642
- Okay.
- I'll be fast.

03:04.717 --> 03:06.048
- Okay.
- Okay.

03:25.872 --> 03:26.998
- Can we go?
- Yes.

03:27.073 --> 03:28.802
You sure? Positive?

03:28.942 --> 03:30.671
Yeah. Come on.

03:51.864 --> 03:52.853
Gross.

03:59.405 --> 04:01.373
Here. Hand me that water.

04:04.043 --> 04:05.510
- Grab the wheel.
- Whoa, whoa.

04:05.578 --> 04:06.567
Come on.

04:18.992 --> 04:21.825
Yeah. That's impressive.

04:21.894 --> 04:23.054
Thank you.

05:17.050 --> 05:19.644
I'm excited
for the girls to meet you.

05:20.586 --> 05:22.645
I can't wait to meet them.

05:26.559 --> 05:29.027
Are your friends
gonna like me?

05:30.029 --> 05:32.054
They're gonna love you.

05:35.301 --> 05:36.598
Look out!

05:45.545 --> 05:46.705
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, shit.

05:46.779 --> 05:47.837
Did you hit him?

05:47.914 --> 05:49.006
What the fuck
was that guy doing
in the road?

05:49.082 --> 05:50.276
Did you hit him?

05:50.350 --> 05:52.750
No. I don't know.
I don't know. Shit.

05:56.756 --> 05:57.780
You okay?

05:57.857 --> 06:00.121
Yeah. We almost killed him.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.388
I'm gonna go see
if he's okay.

06:02.462 --> 06:04.896
What? Why?

06:04.964 --> 06:06.329
Grace, we're in
the middle of nowhere.

06:06.399 --> 06:07.388
We can't just leave
that guy out here.

06:07.467 --> 06:08.456
We gotta see if he's okay.

06:08.534 --> 06:10.092
That guy is just
standing there, Jim.

06:10.236 --> 06:11.794
He's not even moving.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.904
What kind of freak
just stands
in the middle of the road

06:14.974 --> 06:16.942
and doesn't even flinch?

06:18.878 --> 06:20.072
Oh, man.
He's coming over here.

06:20.146 --> 06:21.272
I'm gonna go talk to him.

06:21.347 --> 06:24.373
No, please. Let's just
call somebody for help, okay?
Let's go.

06:24.450 --> 06:27.146
I don't want to
pick up a stranger
out here.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.181
All right. All right.

06:34.293 --> 06:35.282
What's wrong?

06:35.361 --> 06:36.794
Engine's flooded.

06:41.501 --> 06:43.435
Come on. He's coming up here.

06:47.006 --> 06:48.564
Come on...

06:50.476 --> 06:51.465
Fuck.

06:53.913 --> 06:56.404
Come on, start! Come on!

07:31.784 --> 07:32.876
No signal.

07:37.924 --> 07:39.448
This isn't right.

07:40.893 --> 07:43.191
I'm sure someone else
will come along.

07:44.063 --> 07:47.191
Yeah. I hope so.

07:59.011 --> 08:01.946
You know, I never did
a full 360 before.

08:04.016 --> 08:05.074
First one.

08:06.586 --> 08:08.952
Just keep your eyes
on the road.

08:10.256 --> 08:11.484
I will.

08:25.872 --> 08:28.841
Man, raining out there
pretty hard, huh?

08:28.908 --> 08:29.932
Yeah.

08:32.311 --> 08:34.575
Hey, Doritos or Cheetos?

08:35.347 --> 08:36.337
Cheetos.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.645
Ding Dongs or Twinkies?

08:40.753 --> 08:42.083
Ding Dongs.

08:45.758 --> 08:48.659
Damn. Lady knows
her processed foods, huh?

08:48.728 --> 08:49.888
Yeah.

08:50.930 --> 08:52.090
Pump number seven.

08:52.164 --> 08:54.496
Hey, there's a guy broke down
a few miles back.

08:54.567 --> 08:56.592
Can you send someone
with a tow, or...

09:00.006 --> 09:01.735
Yeah, that's a no-can-do.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.240
That's Buford's truck
out there.

09:04.310 --> 09:07.108
Probably be back
around 7:00.

09:10.316 --> 09:11.305
All right.

09:12.718 --> 09:13.810
I'm gonna go
to the bathroom.

09:13.886 --> 09:14.910
- Good.
- Oh.

09:14.987 --> 09:17.820
You need a key, ma'am.
And there you go.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.584
I'm just joking with you.

09:22.094 --> 09:23.322
Thanks.

09:28.668 --> 09:30.295
That's a car, ain't it?

09:30.937 --> 09:32.063
What?

09:32.204 --> 09:33.330
442.

09:34.607 --> 09:36.802
That's a bad-ass
fuckin' ride, man.

09:37.977 --> 09:39.968
Regular little
pussy wagon, huh?

09:41.814 --> 09:42.803
Right.

09:43.983 --> 09:45.712
What do you drive?

09:46.419 --> 09:49.115
Been fixing up this Camaro
in my back yard.

09:49.188 --> 09:51.053
Guys want to take
a little break
from the drive,

09:51.123 --> 09:52.351
you can come on over.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.655
That's all right.
We got to get
on the road, man.

09:54.727 --> 09:56.251
I got a couple of donkeys
in the back yard.

09:56.329 --> 09:58.524
Me and my cousin
raise those things.

09:58.598 --> 09:59.565
I got kicked in the eye.

09:59.632 --> 10:00.656
That's why I got
a lazy eye and shit.

10:00.733 --> 10:01.825
I tried to milk
that son of a bitch.

10:01.901 --> 10:03.027
You can't milk
a fucking donkey, though.

10:03.102 --> 10:04.194
You know what I'm saying?

10:04.270 --> 10:05.259
Yeah.

10:05.338 --> 10:06.532
All right. Anyway.

11:26.018 --> 11:27.212
I'm okay.

11:32.825 --> 11:34.656
- There you go.
- Thanks.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.289
- Hi.
- Hey.

11:40.499 --> 11:41.989
You have a motel nearby?

11:42.234 --> 11:45.362
There's one in Tatum,
about 15 miles north of here.

11:46.539 --> 11:50.566
Hey, I bet you he's that guy
who was having car troubles.

11:52.812 --> 11:57.112
Yeah. Hey, sorry
for taking off back there.

11:58.317 --> 11:59.511
That was you?

11:59.585 --> 12:01.075
Yeah.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.710
Don't worry about it.

12:02.788 --> 12:04.779
I wouldn't have
picked me up, either.

12:07.126 --> 12:08.718
You still headed north?

12:10.196 --> 12:11.322
Yeah.

12:12.798 --> 12:15.767
Would you mind giving me
a ride to the motel?

12:17.436 --> 12:18.801
Yeah, okay.

12:18.871 --> 12:20.270
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

12:22.842 --> 12:23.934
What's going on?

12:24.009 --> 12:25.636
This is the guy
we almost hit.

12:25.711 --> 12:27.008
He can't get a tow
until morning,

12:27.079 --> 12:30.242
so I told him
we could give him a ride
to the motel.

12:30.649 --> 12:31.707
Hi.

12:32.852 --> 12:34.149
I'm John Ryder.

12:35.020 --> 12:36.510
Grace.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.489
Nice to meet you, Grace.

12:51.570 --> 12:53.538
So, where you from, man?

12:54.874 --> 12:56.136
All over.

12:57.843 --> 12:59.367
What do you do?

13:00.780 --> 13:02.805
I'm between jobs. You know?

13:05.818 --> 13:08.480
Yeah.
My dad changed jobs a lot
when I was a kid.

13:08.554 --> 13:09.612
Yeah?

13:09.688 --> 13:11.349
Yeah, he's a salesman.

13:11.423 --> 13:12.447
It's Ford trucks now,

13:12.525 --> 13:15.926
but he's sold
everything from Buicks
to farm equipment.

13:15.995 --> 13:18.793
That's probably what
I'll end up doing, too.

13:31.877 --> 13:33.435
Where you heading?

13:33.512 --> 13:35.503
Lake Havasu. Spring break.

13:39.051 --> 13:40.643
Sounds like fun.

13:40.753 --> 13:42.584
Yeah.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.986
I hope so.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.390
She's a good-looking girl.

13:58.003 --> 13:59.334
Thank you.

14:01.874 --> 14:04.172
How long
you been fuckin' her?

14:04.777 --> 14:06.108
Excuse me?

14:09.081 --> 14:11.015
It's a simple question.

14:20.759 --> 14:23.284
How long you been fucking
your wife?

14:24.763 --> 14:26.390
I don't have one.

14:32.504 --> 14:34.938
Well, what's with
the wedding ring, then?

14:36.709 --> 14:39.701
It helps strangers
think I'm trustworthy.

14:44.049 --> 14:45.414
Aren't you?

14:47.353 --> 14:48.513
No.

14:54.493 --> 14:57.894
Hey, hey, hey!
What the fuck
are you doing, man?

14:57.963 --> 15:00.761
All right, you know what?
That's it.
Ride's over, pal.

15:05.638 --> 15:07.162
Keep driving.

15:08.674 --> 15:11.199
All right. Okay? Okay?

15:23.322 --> 15:25.085
Look, we don't want
any trouble, all right?

15:25.157 --> 15:26.317
We just...
What do you want?

15:26.392 --> 15:27.381
We got money.

15:27.459 --> 15:28.483
I don't want your money.

15:28.560 --> 15:31.085
What do you want?
You want the car?

15:32.231 --> 15:34.131
I don't want your car.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.796
Come on, man.
What do you want, man?

15:43.642 --> 15:45.610
Stop!
Hey, what are you doing?

15:46.211 --> 15:47.371
Jim.

15:47.846 --> 15:49.677
If you fucking hurt her,
you're a fucking dead man!

15:49.748 --> 15:50.874
Jim.

15:51.016 --> 15:52.881
I want you to stop me.

15:52.985 --> 15:54.748
Don't hurt her, all right?
Jim!

15:54.820 --> 15:56.287
Then stop me.

15:57.923 --> 16:00.517
How? You're the one
with the fuckin' knife.

16:00.592 --> 16:03.356
All you have to say
is four little words.

16:03.896 --> 16:06.922
"I want to die."

16:07.766 --> 16:09.131
Say what?

16:09.868 --> 16:13.463
"I want to die."

16:13.772 --> 16:14.796
Don't say it.

16:14.873 --> 16:16.898
For your sake, he better.

16:19.712 --> 16:20.838
You want her to die?

16:20.913 --> 16:21.971
No. No.

16:22.047 --> 16:23.241
Say it!

16:30.022 --> 16:32.513
Come on. I...

16:36.095 --> 16:37.153
I...

16:38.230 --> 16:39.424
Want...

16:39.898 --> 16:40.887
Want...

16:40.966 --> 16:42.092
To...

16:43.502 --> 16:44.594
To...

16:45.771 --> 16:46.999
Die.

16:50.709 --> 16:52.472
I don't want to die!

16:55.848 --> 16:57.475
Get his door! Get the door!

16:57.549 --> 16:59.540
I'm going to kick
this motherfucker out!

17:01.854 --> 17:03.321
Get the door!

17:07.226 --> 17:09.421
Get out of my car!

17:09.494 --> 17:11.053
Fucking psycho fuck!

17:17.970 --> 17:19.733
Fuck you, asshole!

17:34.720 --> 17:36.244
You okay?

17:36.522 --> 17:37.511
Yeah.

17:43.996 --> 17:46.430
Hey, hey, come on.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.131
It's okay.

17:50.002 --> 17:54.268
Hey, come on.
We're okay. It's okay, huh?

18:01.046 --> 18:02.035
It's okay.

18:07.219 --> 18:08.914
We should call the cops.

18:10.622 --> 18:11.611
Okay.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.998
What is it? What is it?

18:22.868 --> 18:24.495
My phone's gone.

18:53.932 --> 18:57.629
<i>Well, as we</i>
<i>come up on 4:00, I've got</i>
<i>something nice and mellow</i>

18:57.703 --> 19:00.137
<i>for all you night owls</i>
<i>out there.</i>

19:00.272 --> 19:02.706
<i>Here's a classic</i>
<i>from David Soul.</i>

20:15.113 --> 20:18.514
Grace? Grace?

20:33.532 --> 20:34.760
Morning.

20:37.402 --> 20:40.428
Jim, I just wanna go home.

20:42.674 --> 20:43.902
Come on.

20:45.010 --> 20:49.140
We'll stop in the next town,
we'll get some food,
I'll talk to the cops,

20:51.750 --> 20:55.311
and we'll be drinking beers
with your friends
by tonight.

20:55.854 --> 20:58.948
Besides, we got one hell
of a story to tell.

21:00.792 --> 21:04.159
Yeah, you just wanna
tell all my friends
you saved my life.

21:05.397 --> 21:06.489
Yeah.

21:25.817 --> 21:27.284
Let's go eat.

22:03.622 --> 22:06.785
Look at this.
It is a beautiful day.

22:10.195 --> 22:11.287
Yeah.

22:38.757 --> 22:41.419
You ever think
about having kids?

22:45.797 --> 22:47.287
Sometimes. I don't know.

22:47.432 --> 22:48.956
Yeah, I guess, eventually.

23:02.013 --> 23:03.344
Oh, my God!

23:04.182 --> 23:05.206
Pull up, pull up.

23:05.283 --> 23:07.751
Shit!
We gotta warn these people.

23:19.664 --> 23:21.097
Sir, you got to stop!

23:21.233 --> 23:22.666
Hey! Hey!

23:23.502 --> 23:25.834
The guy in the back
of your car is crazy!

23:25.904 --> 23:27.303
He pulled a knife on us!

23:27.372 --> 23:28.930
- Stop the car, sir!
- He's dangerous.

23:30.208 --> 23:31.232
Pull your car over!

23:31.309 --> 23:33.675
The guy in the back
of your car is crazy.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.876
He's dangerous!
He has a knife!

23:36.648 --> 23:38.047
- Pull over! He tried to...
- Oh, shit!

23:38.116 --> 23:39.105
What?

23:55.367 --> 23:57.232
Grace.

23:59.471 --> 24:01.063
- Okay.
- Oh, fuck.

24:02.441 --> 24:03.806
We're fine.

24:07.045 --> 24:08.512
- You okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

24:09.881 --> 24:10.939
Yeah.

24:45.016 --> 24:46.643
They didn't stop!

25:02.601 --> 25:03.829
We gotta walk.

25:03.969 --> 25:05.197
Give me a minute.

25:05.303 --> 25:06.395
All right.

25:16.181 --> 25:17.580
Fuck!

25:19.284 --> 25:20.273
Fuck!

25:26.291 --> 25:28.486
How did he find us?

25:29.194 --> 25:30.684
I don't know.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.357
Maybe he wasn't
looking for us.

25:39.037 --> 25:41.164
Maybe it was
just bad luck.

25:46.144 --> 25:48.112
What about
those people?

25:50.348 --> 25:52.077
It's gonna be okay.

25:53.885 --> 25:55.352
No, it isn't.

25:59.090 --> 26:00.216
Hey.

26:00.425 --> 26:01.449
Oh, God.

26:01.526 --> 26:02.652
Hey!

26:02.794 --> 26:03.920
Stop!

26:04.396 --> 26:05.829
- Hey!
- Stop. Stop!

26:05.897 --> 26:07.421
Stop! Please!

26:07.499 --> 26:08.898
- Please!
- Please stop!

26:24.115 --> 26:26.140
Nobody stops for strangers.

26:33.525 --> 26:34.685
Jim.

26:37.662 --> 26:38.890
Oh, no.

26:45.737 --> 26:47.466
You stay behind me.

26:53.612 --> 26:56.342
He might still be inside.
Just stay here.

27:10.528 --> 27:11.688
You don't want to see this.

27:11.763 --> 27:12.855
Why?

27:12.931 --> 27:15.092
Just stay there. Please.

27:26.011 --> 27:27.000
What is it?

27:27.078 --> 27:28.773
Don't you come over here,
all right?

27:28.847 --> 27:30.644
Just... Please! Please!

27:42.794 --> 27:44.261
Oh, sir! Sir!

27:50.735 --> 27:53.465
Oh, Grace, Grace,
this guy's really bleeding.

27:54.172 --> 27:57.164
I think we got to
leave the knife in.
I don't know.

27:57.242 --> 27:58.231
What do we do?
What do we do?

27:58.309 --> 27:59.606
Open the back door.
Can you clear it out?

27:59.678 --> 28:00.804
We gotta get him
to a hospital.

28:00.879 --> 28:01.971
Okay.

28:03.348 --> 28:04.906
Come on, Grace!

28:05.183 --> 28:06.172
Sir?

28:06.251 --> 28:07.240
Okay.

28:07.318 --> 28:08.683
It's all right, sir.

28:08.753 --> 28:10.584
Come on, pick him up.
Pick him up.

28:10.655 --> 28:12.020
Come on, you gotta just...

28:12.157 --> 28:13.522
Sir?

28:13.591 --> 28:14.956
Sir, stay with me,
all right?

28:15.026 --> 28:16.425
I'm gonna get him
in the back seat.

28:16.494 --> 28:18.086
I'll get his legs in.

28:18.163 --> 28:19.926
Okay, go on. Come on.

28:20.065 --> 28:21.862
You gotta drive.
Sir, please...

28:21.933 --> 28:22.957
Oh, God...

28:23.034 --> 28:24.023
Grace!

28:41.653 --> 28:44.019
Be with me in this darkness,
dear Lord.

28:45.023 --> 28:47.685
We're gonna get you help.
Okay, sir?

28:50.295 --> 28:51.922
Is she okay?

28:51.996 --> 28:53.725
No. She is not okay.

28:53.998 --> 28:55.260
You sure she's not okay?

28:55.400 --> 28:56.662
She's not okay.

28:59.671 --> 29:02.003
Try not to move, sir. Please.

29:02.073 --> 29:04.268
How could somebody do this?
You don't just kill a family.

29:04.342 --> 29:05.502
Grace...

29:06.344 --> 29:07.971
- What the fuck?
- What...

29:08.680 --> 29:11.240
Oh, my God. It's him! Fuck!

29:11.816 --> 29:12.942
Just keep driving.

29:13.017 --> 29:14.075
I'm driving. I'm driving.

29:16.521 --> 29:17.681
What does he want?

29:17.756 --> 29:20.782
I don't know. We pushed him
out of a fucking car!
What do you think?

29:20.859 --> 29:24.056
Yeah? What were we
supposed to do?
Let him kill us?

29:27.899 --> 29:29.799
Can't this thing go
any faster? Just drive!

29:29.868 --> 29:31.529
I'm trying, okay?

29:33.238 --> 29:34.865
Come on! Come on!

29:44.816 --> 29:47.717
Come on.
I don't wanna die out here.

29:59.230 --> 30:00.857
What do you think?
What's he doing?

30:00.932 --> 30:02.058
What do you think
he's doing?

30:02.133 --> 30:03.623
Where'd he go?

30:08.406 --> 30:09.634
Oh, shit.

30:09.741 --> 30:12.608
We gotta get this guy
to a hospital, Grace.

30:25.690 --> 30:29.148
Grace, go inside
and call the police,
all right? Get some towels.

30:29.227 --> 30:30.387
- I'm gonna stay here
with him.
- Okay.

30:30.461 --> 30:31.655
Okay.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.030
Sir, we're gonna
get you some help.

30:35.166 --> 30:36.565
Okay? Okay?

30:42.574 --> 30:44.542
Can you call 911, please?
It's an emergency!

30:44.609 --> 30:46.201
What's going on?

30:46.477 --> 30:48.308
Towels. I need towels.

30:48.446 --> 30:49.504
Paper towels are
in the bathroom.

30:49.581 --> 30:51.173
- Where is your bathroom?
- It's over there.

30:51.249 --> 30:52.341
Thank you.

31:04.929 --> 31:06.556

34:02.040 --> 34:03.803
- I just saw him right there.
- You have the right
to an attorney.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.069
If you cannot
afford an attorney...

34:05.143 --> 34:06.235
She didn't do anything!

44:14.885 --> 44:17.615
Come on,
we'll get one of
these cars.

44:19.323 --> 44:20.984
- Jim, get down!
- Oh, fuck.

44:39.376 --> 44:41.344
- Is there a way out?
- No!

44:42.813 --> 44:44.440
- See him?
- No.

44:50.120 --> 44:52.850
He comes through
that door, he's dead!

45:09.339 --> 45:11.000
Twenty-one years old.

45:12.076 --> 45:13.839
They didn't do it, boys.

45:13.911 --> 45:17.278
College students.
They didn't do this.

45:17.347 --> 45:18.609
They didn't.

45:19.850 --> 45:21.511
You see him?

45:21.585 --> 45:23.348
No, I don't see him.

45:25.122 --> 45:27.147
I don't know
where he went.

45:27.624 --> 45:30.889
Oh, God. Jim... Jim...

45:32.162 --> 45:33.857
- What?
- There's a cop.

45:36.734 --> 45:38.895
It's the cop from the diner.

45:41.105 --> 45:42.299
We got to talk to him.

45:42.372 --> 45:44.397
No. No. No.
He thinks we did it.

45:44.475 --> 45:47.410
Only chance we have
to get out of here.

45:57.755 --> 45:59.017
All right.
You take this, all right?

45:59.089 --> 46:00.454
Okay.

46:00.524 --> 46:01.582
- All right?
- Okay.

46:01.658 --> 46:02.682
I'm gonna go talk to him.

46:02.760 --> 46:04.250
You just watch. Watch.

46:04.328 --> 46:05.522
Okay.

46:15.072 --> 46:17.040
Officer, please,
you don't understand!
We're all in danger here.

46:17.107 --> 46:19.075
You aren't going anywhere
this time, son.

46:19.143 --> 46:20.132
Please, Officer!

46:20.210 --> 46:21.234
This is SO-235.

46:21.311 --> 46:22.539
I have the male suspect
in custody.

46:22.613 --> 46:25.548
<i>I repeat, I have</i>
<i>the male suspect in custody.</i>

46:25.649 --> 46:28.015
The female remains at large.

46:29.453 --> 46:30.852
Get off him.

46:34.224 --> 46:35.623
State 531.

46:35.692 --> 46:37.319
We have a support unit
just minutes away.

46:37.394 --> 46:38.383
<i>Do you copy?</i>

46:38.529 --> 46:39.553
Come on. Get up.

46:39.630 --> 46:41.154
Take it easy.

46:41.298 --> 46:42.822
Let's not go do
anything stupid.

46:42.900 --> 46:44.128
Just stay calm.

46:44.268 --> 46:45.496
I am calm.

46:45.569 --> 46:46.968
Grace.

46:47.037 --> 46:49.665
Hey! Just keep your hands
in the air, please.

46:49.740 --> 46:51.674
Grace, you don't need
to do this.

46:51.742 --> 46:53.266
Jim, take it.

46:56.213 --> 46:58.078
Sorry about this, man.

46:58.415 --> 47:00.440
We have to
get out of here.

47:01.351 --> 47:04.548
We got to go. Come on,
let's get in the car.

47:05.055 --> 47:06.579
Please, sir. Please.

47:09.259 --> 47:11.056
- Turn around, please, sir.
- Okay. Okay.

47:11.128 --> 47:12.595
Okay.

47:12.663 --> 47:14.028
What the fuck
are you doing?

47:14.097 --> 47:15.826
What am I supposed to do?
We have to get out of here.

47:15.899 --> 47:17.059
I know,
but this is crazy.

47:17.134 --> 47:18.795
I know.

47:18.869 --> 47:20.200
Just go...

47:27.110 --> 47:28.702
Please get in the car, sir.

47:28.779 --> 47:30.644
Listen. Just take it easy.

47:31.882 --> 47:33.509
- Just give me the gun.
- No. You don't understand.

47:33.584 --> 47:34.573
We don't have time
for this.

47:34.651 --> 47:35.640
We have to
get out of here.

47:35.719 --> 47:36.777
Grace, we got to go.

47:36.854 --> 47:40.221
Come on, please just
get in the car. Get in.

47:48.799 --> 47:50.266
What did you do?

47:50.334 --> 47:51.494
- Freeze!
- I didn't do it!

47:52.870 --> 47:54.394
Get in the car!
Get in the car!

47:54.538 --> 47:56.096
We got to get out of here!

48:05.249 --> 48:07.376
SO-236.
We have an officer down!

48:07.451 --> 48:09.180
We have an officer down!

48:09.519 --> 48:11.214
<i>Female suspect shot Edwards.</i>

48:11.288 --> 48:14.587
She took off
in a Torrance County
Sheriff's vehicle!

48:32.042 --> 48:33.236
What the fuck
happened back there?

48:33.310 --> 48:35.073
It must've been him!

48:37.214 --> 48:39.478
He's not going to stop, is he?

48:40.217 --> 48:41.309
No.

48:51.028 --> 48:52.290
He's framing us.

48:52.362 --> 48:54.091
No. No. If he was doing that,
he would have stopped

48:54.164 --> 48:55.222
when he killed the family.

48:55.299 --> 48:56.288
Then what does he want?

48:56.366 --> 48:57.628
I don't know!

49:02.940 --> 49:05.670
<i>Suspects armed</i>
<i>and considered dangerous.</i>

49:09.947 --> 49:13.781
<i>Lieutenant, we are</i>
<i>in pursuit of the suspects</i>
<i>on Highway 285.</i>

49:15.018 --> 49:16.485
<i>Copy that.</i>
<i>They are armed and dangerous.</i>

49:16.586 --> 49:19.680
<i>How long till</i>
<i>my air support is 10-97?</i>

49:19.756 --> 49:21.951
<i>This is Air 2.</i>
<i>We're on their 20,</i>
<i>but don't have a visual.</i>

49:22.025 --> 49:23.083
Get on that thing
and tell them

49:23.160 --> 49:24.593
that he's back there
in the trailer park.

49:24.661 --> 49:26.356
Get on that thing.

49:27.497 --> 49:28.657
Hello?

49:29.566 --> 49:31.864
<i>Is this on?</i>
<i>Can anybody hear me?</i>

49:33.971 --> 49:35.233
Oh, shit!

49:38.108 --> 49:40.133
<i>Air 2 to base.</i>
<i>We've spotted the suspects.</i>

49:40.277 --> 49:42.336
<i>We're joining</i>
<i>ground pursuit.</i>

49:42.412 --> 49:44.312
This is bad.

49:44.381 --> 49:46.542
<i>Grace Andrews</i>
<i>and Jim Halsey.</i>

49:47.250 --> 49:48.615
This is
Lieutenant Esteridge

49:48.685 --> 49:50.380
with the New Mexico
State Police Department.

49:50.454 --> 49:51.751
How y'all doing?

49:51.822 --> 49:54.518
Listen, we're really
not too good, okay?

49:54.591 --> 49:56.286
The guy that shot that cop
is back there

49:56.360 --> 49:58.988
in the trailer park
that we just pulled out of,
off of that dirt road.

49:59.062 --> 50:00.791
Well, now, you see,
I have an officer down,

50:00.864 --> 50:02.525
and I have a witness
says that you did it.

50:02.599 --> 50:04.260
<i>So you'll pull</i>
<i>your car over.</i>

50:04.334 --> 50:06.928
If you feel like
talking about it,
we can talk about it then.

50:07.004 --> 50:07.993
Okay, what do we do?

50:08.071 --> 50:09.060
Just tell him
that you didn't do it.

50:09.139 --> 50:10.504
Listen to me.

50:10.574 --> 50:13.134
<i>I did not shoot that cop!</i>
<i>Okay?</i>

50:13.210 --> 50:15.644
I didn't shoot him,
we didn't kill that family,
we haven't done anything.

50:15.712 --> 50:17.646
When are you gonna
believe us?

50:17.714 --> 50:21.081
Now, now, now, you don't
make the rules around here,
you see? I do.

50:21.151 --> 50:23.915
<i>So, why don't you</i>
<i>just pull over</i>
<i>so we'll chat about it</i>

50:24.321 --> 50:26.084
<i>before this thing gets</i>
<i>out of control, okay?</i>

50:26.156 --> 50:27.453
We can't. He's close.

50:27.524 --> 50:29.253
We can't pull over here.
It's not safe.

50:29.326 --> 50:31.351
<i>Why don't you</i>
<i>just pull the car over,</i>

50:31.495 --> 50:33.554
or I'll have my men
help you do it?

50:33.630 --> 50:35.393
We cannot pull over here!

50:35.465 --> 50:36.625
You don't understand!

50:37.834 --> 50:40.701
<i>Suspects are still</i>
<i>not stopping, sir.</i>

50:40.937 --> 50:42.962
I don't give a rat's cock bag
how you do it!

50:43.040 --> 50:45.201
<i>You will pull them over</i>
<i>and stop them right now!</i>
<i>Over!</i>

50:45.275 --> 50:46.264
<i>Copy on that.</i>

50:46.910 --> 50:48.343
What the...

50:48.478 --> 50:49.877
Oh, my God!

50:50.781 --> 50:52.009
Oh, shit!

50:55.585 --> 50:56.745
- I'm gonna pull over!
- Okay! Okay! Okay!

50:56.820 --> 50:57.878
Oh, fuck!

50:57.954 --> 50:59.649
<i>Lieutenant,</i>
<i>ground is firing on suspects.</i>

50:59.723 --> 51:01.486
Hold her steady!

51:04.694 --> 51:05.786
Okay, we're pulling over.

51:05.862 --> 51:06.886
Please, just stop shooting!

51:06.963 --> 51:09.932
<i>Air 2 to ground,</i>
<i>you got another vehicle</i>
<i>approaching fast from behind.</i>

51:10.000 --> 51:12.059
<i>It's a late-model</i>
<i>black Trans Am.</i>

51:18.642 --> 51:19.939
- Oh, fuck!
- What?

51:20.911 --> 51:22.811
It's him, Jim.

51:22.879 --> 51:24.005
Fuck!

51:28.151 --> 51:29.209
<i>Somebody talk to me.</i>

51:29.286 --> 51:31.880
<i>Have you pulled over</i>
<i>the suspects yet?</i>

51:37.794 --> 51:39.887
<i>What the fuck</i>
<i>is going on down there?</i>

51:51.908 --> 51:53.170
Fuck!

51:57.314 --> 51:58.645
Oh, my God!

52:13.130 --> 52:15.325
<i>What's going on</i>
<i>down there?</i>

52:19.469 --> 52:20.458
Fuck!

52:28.345 --> 52:30.142
Son of a bitch!

52:30.280 --> 52:32.111
You gotta be
five-finger fucking me!

52:36.820 --> 52:37.912
Keep going!

52:38.054 --> 52:39.180
Grace, I can't go
any faster!

52:39.256 --> 52:40.245
Just drive. Go.

52:40.323 --> 52:41.312
I can't go
any fuckin' faster!

52:43.927 --> 52:45.417
Oh, fuck.

53:02.412 --> 53:04.039
Where's he going?

53:21.298 --> 53:22.663
Come on. We got to go.

53:22.732 --> 53:24.063
He might come back.

53:24.134 --> 53:25.294
Where?

53:30.140 --> 53:31.505
Jim.

53:31.708 --> 53:33.642
Get your gun. Let's go.

53:35.946 --> 53:37.140
Okay.

55:17.881 --> 55:19.849
All right.
We're good.

55:44.240 --> 55:45.867
Try to call home.

56:00.490 --> 56:01.957
What's wrong?

56:02.192 --> 56:04.490
It goes right to
the front desk.

56:05.261 --> 56:06.853
Are you serious?

56:47.771 --> 56:50.035
I should go find a payphone.

56:50.540 --> 56:53.475
Call our folks,
see if we can get some help.

56:54.043 --> 56:56.204
I'll be back in 15 minutes.

56:58.615 --> 56:59.604
Okay.

57:09.659 --> 57:10.990
Hey.

57:12.495 --> 57:14.690
I'm sorry
I got us into this.

57:32.115 --> 57:33.446
<i>Well, what about</i>
<i>the lovebirds?</i>

57:33.516 --> 57:35.711
<i>Are you sure</i>
<i>you wouldn't like to see</i>
<i>a canary instead?</i>

57:35.785 --> 57:37.616
<i>We have some very nice</i>
<i>canaries this week.</i>

57:37.754 --> 57:39.619
<i>All right.</i>

57:41.758 --> 57:43.555
<i>All right,</i>
<i>may I see them, please?</i>

57:55.839 --> 57:57.431
<i>There we are.</i>

57:57.574 --> 57:59.201
<i>Whoa, there.</i>

58:01.010 --> 58:03.478
<i>Back in your gilded cage,</i>
<i>Melanie Daniels.</i>

58:35.144 --> 58:37.237
You're making me horny.

58:42.819 --> 58:44.411
I'm fuckin' horny, too!

59:20.557 --> 59:22.024
I have a gun!

01:00:42.672 --> 01:00:43.730
Jim?

01:00:47.677 --> 01:00:48.735
Jim?

01:00:54.751 --> 01:00:55.809
Jim!

01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:06.386
Jim!

01:01:12.135 --> 01:01:13.193
Jim?

01:01:16.406 --> 01:01:17.464
Jim?

01:01:28.651 --> 01:01:29.811
Jim!

01:01:35.291 --> 01:01:36.553
Okay, I'll get you.

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:38.992
- Grace! Help me!
- I'm here and I'm gonna
get you down.

01:01:39.062 --> 01:01:40.689
I'm gonna get you down.

01:01:41.798 --> 01:01:44.096
You've got to get me
out of here.

01:01:44.167 --> 01:01:46.032
- It really hurts!
- I know. Just hold still.
Just hold still.

01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:47.933
- Please stop him. Please!
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:01:53.476 --> 01:01:54.966
No!

01:01:55.044 --> 01:01:57.137
Stop it!
You're killing him!

01:02:01.751 --> 01:02:03.241
Turn it off!

01:02:03.753 --> 01:02:04.777
No.

01:02:04.854 --> 01:02:06.583
Turn the truck off!

01:02:07.256 --> 01:02:08.985
These clutches
are tricky things.

01:02:09.492 --> 01:02:10.686
Touchy, you know.

01:02:15.131 --> 01:02:16.996
One little slip, and...

01:02:17.166 --> 01:02:18.793
I will shoot you.

01:02:19.068 --> 01:02:21.901
You shoot me,
my foot comes off the clutch.

01:02:22.605 --> 01:02:23.970
Now, get in.

01:02:24.774 --> 01:02:26.071
- Get in!
- Okay.

01:02:32.782 --> 01:02:34.374
Close the door.

01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:43.119
Turn it off.

01:02:43.192 --> 01:02:45.092
Stop! Stop the truck!

01:02:46.729 --> 01:02:48.196
Turn it off!

01:02:52.301 --> 01:02:53.290
I can't.

01:02:53.369 --> 01:02:56.532
Yes, you can.
Just turn it off.

01:02:57.507 --> 01:02:59.839
I can't. I can't.

01:03:03.346 --> 01:03:04.836
You're sick.

01:03:06.816 --> 01:03:08.443
What do you want?

01:03:15.858 --> 01:03:17.689
Point it in my face.

01:03:21.864 --> 01:03:23.388
Right here.

01:03:27.036 --> 01:03:28.264
Do it.

01:03:32.742 --> 01:03:34.903
It's your chance, Grace,

01:03:34.977 --> 01:03:36.137
your chance to kill a man

01:03:36.212 --> 01:03:38.112
who's gonna kill
your whiny fuckin' boyfriend.

01:03:38.181 --> 01:03:41.344
No! Don't you say that!
Don't say that to me!

01:03:42.418 --> 01:03:45.251
I want to die.

01:03:47.623 --> 01:03:49.818
Now pull the fuckin' trigger.

01:04:00.636 --> 01:04:02.126
State police!

01:04:03.306 --> 01:04:04.898
Put the gun down!

01:04:05.641 --> 01:04:08.576
This is the police!
Drop the gun now!

01:04:08.644 --> 01:04:10.168
Don't listen to them.

01:04:13.816 --> 01:04:17.616
No. Stop. Please.

01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:18.779
Put the gun down!

01:04:18.855 --> 01:04:20.948
Go ahead. You can do it!

01:04:21.023 --> 01:04:23.218
Put it down!
Put the gun down!

01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:25.425
Put the gun down now!

01:04:25.494 --> 01:04:28.088
Put that gun down,
God damn it!

01:04:28.164 --> 01:04:29.495
I can't...

01:04:34.437 --> 01:04:35.734
Please.

01:04:35.805 --> 01:04:37.705
Please, don't tease him.
Please.

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.774
Please,
just stop hurting him.

01:04:39.842 --> 01:04:41.434
Please!

01:04:43.312 --> 01:04:46.179
This is the police!
Put the gun down now!

01:04:49.518 --> 01:04:50.644
No.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.415
You useless waste!

01:04:52.488 --> 01:04:54.149
No! No!

01:04:57.693 --> 01:04:59.217
No!

01:05:02.765 --> 01:05:03.754
No!

01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:06.360
Get your hands off of me!

01:05:08.437 --> 01:05:10.268
<i>Get up here!</i>
<i>Get up here!</i>

01:05:10.339 --> 01:05:12.569
<i>Let's go, man. This way!</i>

01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:23.381
<i>I want to die.</i>

01:05:29.225 --> 01:05:31.693
- <i>No!</i>
- Grace?

01:05:41.871 --> 01:05:44.271
Grace, do you know
who this man is?

01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:49.844
That's the real John Ryder.

01:05:49.979 --> 01:05:51.879
He's been missing
since Tuesday.

01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:58.680
Then who...

01:05:58.754 --> 01:05:59.880
We don't know yet.

01:06:00.489 --> 01:06:02.150
Now, we've run
his fingerprints
and mug shots

01:06:02.224 --> 01:06:03.282
through every database
we've got,

01:06:03.359 --> 01:06:04.417
and we've come up
with nothing.

01:06:04.493 --> 01:06:06.358
This guy's a ghost.

01:06:06.462 --> 01:06:09.431
<i>So, I need your help</i>
<i>here, Grace.</i>

01:06:09.532 --> 01:06:12.296
<i>Is there anything</i>
<i>he told you about himself?</i>

01:06:12.902 --> 01:06:14.028
<i>No.</i>

01:06:14.971 --> 01:06:16.063
<i>Anything at all?</i>

01:06:20.209 --> 01:06:21.233
No.

01:06:28.117 --> 01:06:29.675
Open cell F!

01:06:32.421 --> 01:06:36.915
Ryder, I need you to stand up
and put your hands
behind your back.

01:06:36.993 --> 01:06:40.360
I need you to stand up,
put your hands
behind your back.

01:07:00.983 --> 01:07:02.644
So, where are you from?

01:07:03.753 --> 01:07:05.015
All over.

01:07:07.223 --> 01:07:08.520
Is that so?

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:13.155
You're a sick fuck,
aren't ya?

01:07:14.063 --> 01:07:16.554
The way you tortured
that young man.

01:07:16.999 --> 01:07:18.990
I know
you enjoyed yourself.

01:07:21.103 --> 01:07:22.764
I just can't figure out
why you did it.

01:07:22.905 --> 01:07:24.600
You knew
you'd get caught.

01:07:24.673 --> 01:07:26.265
Why'd you do it?

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:29.272
Why not?

01:07:32.581 --> 01:07:34.981
How many others
have you killed?

01:07:39.655 --> 01:07:41.054
Hard to say.

01:07:45.294 --> 01:07:47.524
You see,
here in the great state
of New Mexico,

01:07:47.663 --> 01:07:49.893
we do have
the death penalty.

01:07:52.368 --> 01:07:54.461
You don't seem
too worried.

01:07:57.573 --> 01:07:58.972
Should I be?

01:08:04.046 --> 01:08:06.446
You comfy down there, John?

01:08:06.882 --> 01:08:09.009
Are those cuffs
a little tight?

01:08:09.785 --> 01:08:11.412
Yeah, a little tight.

01:08:11.487 --> 01:08:14.217
Yeah, you see,
those are the new ones.

01:08:17.059 --> 01:08:20.426
They stretch out after
you wear them for a while.
Let me see.

01:08:24.166 --> 01:08:25.689
Look at me.

01:08:29.438 --> 01:08:31.633
You have yourself
a nice trip.

01:08:32.841 --> 01:08:34.935
We'll chat again real soon.

01:08:36.011 --> 01:08:38.809
Maybe next time,
you'll be better company.

01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:14.071
Thanks.

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.249
Where are we going?

01:09:19.654 --> 01:09:22.818
I'm taking you to Albuquerque
for trauma support.

01:09:23.024 --> 01:09:25.425
I can release you
to your parents there.

01:09:52.121 --> 01:09:53.486
Step up.

01:10:42.438 --> 01:10:44.599
03 X-ray,
we're about 20 minutes out.

01:10:44.673 --> 01:10:46.436
<i>Copy that, 03 X-ray.</i>

01:10:49.712 --> 01:10:50.906
I get home,
I look at my paycheck.

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:51.969
It's so skinny.

01:10:52.748 --> 01:10:54.238
I decide to take
another job.

01:10:54.383 --> 01:10:55.907
So now
I'm delivering pizza.

01:11:03.826 --> 01:11:05.919
What are you
getting your daughter
for her birthday?

01:11:06.028 --> 01:11:08.155
She's just turned five.

01:11:08.230 --> 01:11:09.754
She wants to take me...
Go to the mall,

01:11:09.832 --> 01:11:11.766
get one of those big
customized teddy bears.

01:11:11.834 --> 01:11:13.358
A customized teddy bear?
Come on.

01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:14.766
Yeah.

01:11:14.837 --> 01:11:17.635
It's just another way
they can charge...

01:11:39.094 --> 01:11:40.755
Look, Grace...

01:11:42.498 --> 01:11:43.624
I wish I could have
stopped this

01:11:43.699 --> 01:11:46.566
before it got
all out of control.

01:11:48.504 --> 01:11:52.338
I know there's
nothing that I can say
that'll bring Jim back,

01:11:54.376 --> 01:11:55.934
but I am sorry.

01:11:57.112 --> 01:11:58.545
I truly am.

01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:03.815
Get your own little pants,
your own little jacket.

01:12:03.886 --> 01:12:05.911
Make your own
little teddy bear.

01:12:23.339 --> 01:12:25.170
For real, you spent
100 bucks on a teddy bear?

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:26.730
Yeah, I know.
It was hurting me.

01:12:26.875 --> 01:12:28.365
Yeah, it's 100 bucks...

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:33.714
You know,
this week's check,
it's gone.

01:12:54.336 --> 01:12:56.065
Stop moving.

01:12:56.138 --> 01:12:57.730
What the fuck?

01:13:05.848 --> 01:13:06.837
It's cool...

01:13:09.752 --> 01:13:10.844
Oh, shit!

01:13:16.091 --> 01:13:17.718
Son of a bitch!

01:13:36.779 --> 01:13:38.406
My leg's stuck.

01:13:44.253 --> 01:13:45.777
03 X-ray.

01:13:45.854 --> 01:13:48.345
I need a Code 3 backup
on Highway 19.

01:13:48.624 --> 01:13:50.148
<i>10-4, 03 X-ray.</i>

01:13:50.492 --> 01:13:54.622
Grace, I want you
to run up over that hill
and wait there for help.

01:13:55.831 --> 01:13:57.731
I'm done running.

01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:00.132
Grace! Grace!

01:14:01.236 --> 01:14:03.101
That's not the answer.

01:14:03.505 --> 01:14:05.200
You don't know
what you're doing.

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:06.605
Yes, I do.

01:14:14.316 --> 01:14:15.476
Grace!

01:14:23.759 --> 01:14:25.522
Grace, be careful!

01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:42.233
Backup, now!
Let's go!

01:14:47.983 --> 01:14:51.043
03 X-ray. Where the hell
is my goddamn backup?

01:14:55.691 --> 01:14:57.454
You better hurry.

01:15:54.416 --> 01:15:55.713
Grace!

01:16:19.107 --> 01:16:20.734
Go fuck yourself!

01:16:24.813 --> 01:16:25.837
No!

01:17:33.148 --> 01:17:35.173
Feels good, doesn't it?

01:17:36.652 --> 01:17:38.517
I don't feel a thing.
