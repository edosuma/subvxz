WEBVTT

00:26.662 --> 00:28.539
Hey, where are you headed?

00:28.664 --> 00:30.499
To kill that piece of shit
down the way.

00:30.957 --> 00:32.000
OK.

03:37.584 --> 03:39.503
Maggie, you alright?

03:41.255 --> 03:43.881
I'm fine, Victoria.

03:45.383 --> 03:46.426
Maggie?

03:48.136 --> 03:51.097
Isn't that the name of the girl
my daddy hit with his car?

03:52.097 --> 03:54.599
I just came to say Merry Christmas.

03:55.267 --> 03:57.603
And to say... you're next.

04:02.733 --> 04:05.068
Vic? It's me.

04:08.947 --> 04:09.864
You OK?

04:27.004 --> 04:28.797
They're getting worse, aren't they?

04:30.382 --> 04:31.760
The visions.

04:35.971 --> 04:38.682
Yeah, it's from taking
my bridge to Iowa.

04:42.310 --> 04:44.353
Well, the good news is,

04:44.479 --> 04:46.814
now we know I can travel
the Shorter Way with you.

04:48.024 --> 04:51.277
As long as I'm on your bike,
which means we can hunt the Wraith...

04:51.401 --> 04:53.403
You scared the shit
out of me, Maggie.

04:57.740 --> 04:59.158
I'm OK now.

05:02.369 --> 05:04.163
I had no idea that you were...

05:05.331 --> 05:07.124
you know, feeling like that.

05:12.671 --> 05:17.467
The Wraith... took Bly
while I was strung out.

05:20.345 --> 05:22.554
I passed out in a pill coma...

05:23.305 --> 05:26.809
woke up in his house,
where he took me to keep me safe...

05:27.768 --> 05:29.102
and...

05:32.021 --> 05:33.272
he was gone.

05:33.815 --> 05:35.399
It wasn't your fault.

05:35.900 --> 05:39.237
Yeah, it was.
I got him mixed up in this.

05:39.946 --> 05:40.779
No.

05:40.905 --> 05:44.115
I threw away my Scrabble bag
so I couldn't even see it coming.

05:49.204 --> 05:52.623
Joe was the closest thing
I ever had to a family.

05:54.376 --> 05:56.210
And I got him killed.

05:57.878 --> 06:00.213
And then I was alone.

06:02.049 --> 06:03.092
Again.

06:03.592 --> 06:06.094
- So...
- You weren't alone.

06:06.678 --> 06:08.263
Not then, not now.

06:24.819 --> 06:26.572
Is everything OK?

06:29.282 --> 06:32.243
I got somebody else mixed up in this
too, and I'm really scared.

06:56.431 --> 06:57.516
Vic...

06:58.516 --> 07:01.811
Vic, stop. You can't just go inside.

07:10.194 --> 07:12.739
Bing's got him somewhere.
Or worse.

07:14.573 --> 07:17.576
Craig?
Where are you?

07:46.685 --> 07:48.228
We mustn't tarry, Mr. Partridge.

07:48.354 --> 07:51.481
This little detour has delayed
Bradley's trip to Christmasland

07:51.607 --> 07:53.734
and left the child
without his dinner.

07:56.152 --> 07:58.613
A tasty treat for Bradley.

07:58.738 --> 08:00.323
Who is so nice and sweet.

08:03.325 --> 08:04.660
Why, Bing!

08:05.827 --> 08:08.955
You'll be the last boy chosen
at the dance.

08:09.580 --> 08:11.041
What happened to your face?

08:18.339 --> 08:19.757
Vic McQueen attacked me.

08:20.841 --> 08:22.426
Out of the blue?

08:24.719 --> 08:25.971
In my basement.

08:28.348 --> 08:30.141
In the House of Sleep?

08:30.266 --> 08:32.727
I didn't touch her.
Not like that, I promise.

08:35.562 --> 08:37.606
I knew you'd be mad, Mr. Manx.

08:39.232 --> 08:41.360
But I was just trying to help you.

08:41.485 --> 08:44.445
Your only job
is to help rescue children.

08:45.197 --> 08:47.490
Victoria McQueen belongs
on the naughty list.

08:47.615 --> 08:49.742
You're the one
who's on the naughty list,

08:49.867 --> 08:51.868
and you've been there
for quite some time.

08:52.370 --> 08:54.122
Do you know what happens to those

08:54.247 --> 08:56.124
who can't find their way
off the list?

08:57.916 --> 08:59.835
They get punished.

09:04.131 --> 09:05.674
Now get in.

09:13.055 --> 09:14.681
But Vic's the one who deserves...

09:14.807 --> 09:17.393
Get in the car.

09:17.518 --> 09:19.562
She doesn't belong in Christmasland.

09:19.686 --> 09:21.229
That is not for you to decide.

09:21.354 --> 09:23.857
I found drugs in her bedroom.

09:25.191 --> 09:26.443
I found rubbers.

09:29.778 --> 09:32.489
I can no longer trust your word
on anything, Mr. Partridge.

09:32.614 --> 09:34.450
But Mr. Manx, you don't have to.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.994
Just ask the boy. He'll tell you.

09:41.582 --> 09:42.623
Yeah.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.043
Yeah.

09:58.555 --> 10:00.765
Who in God's name is that?

10:26.955 --> 10:28.916
Try to remain calm, dear boy.

10:29.458 --> 10:31.126
If you promise to behave

10:31.251 --> 10:34.212
I'll let you breathe fresh oxygen
for a few minutes.

10:34.796 --> 10:36.255
How does that sound?

10:39.675 --> 10:42.178
Now, why did you endeavor

10:42.302 --> 10:45.680
to attack poor old Mr. Partridge?

10:46.389 --> 10:48.350
For what he tried to do to Vic.

10:50.060 --> 10:53.438
And what you two did
to Haley and Sharon Smith.

10:54.773 --> 10:57.359
I admire your chivalrous spirit.

10:58.776 --> 11:01.779
There aren't many boys these days
who would put themselves at risk

11:01.903 --> 11:04.364
to protect the honor of a woman.

11:05.324 --> 11:07.117
Vic doesn't need my protection.

11:07.242 --> 11:10.036
Then why risk so much on her behalf?

11:15.667 --> 11:18.043
You're in love with her.

11:19.628 --> 11:21.004
I don't blame you.

11:21.713 --> 11:24.174
There's a lot to love
about Vic McQueen.

11:26.050 --> 11:28.761
The only question is,
does she love you?

11:32.056 --> 11:33.473
She loves me.

11:37.894 --> 11:39.104
Have you...

11:41.106 --> 11:42.774
consummated your love?

11:49.905 --> 11:52.074
A girl as strong and pure
as Vic McQueen,

11:52.199 --> 11:56.370
ruined by such a weak
and unremarkable boy.

11:58.414 --> 12:00.081
Wherever we're going,

12:01.000 --> 12:02.750
she's going to find me.

12:05.003 --> 12:06.962
And then she's going to kill you.

12:10.215 --> 12:12.718
She can certainly try her best.

12:16.430 --> 12:19.224
Pity, now,
I'll have to do the same.

12:21.768 --> 12:22.685
Don't you dare.

12:22.810 --> 12:24.687
Do try and get some rest.

12:25.897 --> 12:30.192
The road to Christmasland
is paved in dreams.

12:31.944 --> 12:33.154
Wait...

12:44.330 --> 12:47.750
Turns out your instincts
about Vic McQueen were correct, Bing.

12:49.084 --> 12:52.462
You've spared the children
a grave disappointment.

12:55.632 --> 12:57.592
So I'm off the naughty list?

13:00.929 --> 13:03.013
Go home, clean up and clear out.

13:03.972 --> 13:06.726
The police will be on your tail
in short order.

13:07.309 --> 13:11.063
If you're taken in, there will be
no cocoa or presents in your future.

13:11.188 --> 13:12.898
But if you can avoid detection,

13:13.023 --> 13:15.442
procure more gingerbread gas...

13:16.442 --> 13:18.778
and make your way safely here...

13:22.448 --> 13:26.368
then I'll call on you
after I'm done with Vic McQueen.

13:31.873 --> 13:33.083
Thank you, Mr. Manx.

13:49.305 --> 13:50.890
Where is Craig?

13:59.815 --> 14:01.316
OK...

14:02.526 --> 14:04.069
Can the Brat find the Wraith?

14:12.535 --> 14:15.204
- I'm going after it.
- Wait. One more.

14:18.415 --> 14:20.333
Is the Brat ready?

14:47.525 --> 14:48.525
Vic?

14:49.444 --> 14:51.321
Didn't you see what they said?

14:53.947 --> 14:56.783
I saw Jolene overheat the Wraith
and take it out of commission.

14:56.908 --> 14:59.411
The tiles say you're not ready.

14:59.536 --> 15:00.996
It's Craig.

15:02.288 --> 15:04.665
I drove him out to the woods
and showed him my bridge.

15:05.624 --> 15:07.752
I ran to him after I got out
of Bing's basement.

15:07.877 --> 15:10.503
I've run to him for everything
since we were six.

15:13.591 --> 15:16.634
I love him, Maggie.
And now Manx has him.

15:17.927 --> 15:19.888
That will never destroy the Wraith.

15:20.012 --> 15:21.097
Well, it has to.

15:21.221 --> 15:24.058
Vic, the tiles are always right.

15:25.392 --> 15:28.395
Well, maybe it was "O, N."
Like "on," like, "game on."

15:29.938 --> 15:32.274
OK. OK, fine.

15:32.399 --> 15:33.525
Fine. Let's go.

15:34.150 --> 15:35.443
Maggie, you can't come.

15:35.569 --> 15:36.904
Yes, I can.

15:38.112 --> 15:40.948
I rode over your bridge with you
on the back of your bike.

15:41.074 --> 15:43.159
Yeah, after you almost died.

15:43.283 --> 15:45.369
You haven't slept.
You can barely walk.

15:45.494 --> 15:48.080
Wherever my bridge takes me
I'm going to need to run.

15:48.205 --> 15:50.832
You have to stay here.
Help the police track down Bing.

15:55.045 --> 15:56.253
Call me...

15:57.130 --> 16:00.674
when you get to wherever it is
you end up going.

16:04.177 --> 16:05.387
Call me.

16:23.278 --> 16:25.531
There's been a fight.
There's blood everywhere.

16:26.156 --> 16:29.075
And I think Bing Partridge
has my friend Vic McQueen.

16:29.201 --> 16:32.578
When I saw her boyfriend's dirtbike,
I knew something was wrong.

16:32.703 --> 16:36.289
Craig must have found out that Bing
had her and come to save her, but...

16:37.124 --> 16:39.126
now Bing has them both.

16:39.919 --> 16:42.212
You've had
a hell of a few weeks.

16:42.629 --> 16:44.756
Glad to see you
back on your feet, Miss Leigh.

16:46.758 --> 16:49.552
Detective Hutter.
I was at the hospital.

16:49.677 --> 16:52.346
- You were in and out at the time.
- Right. Sorry.

16:53.389 --> 16:55.641
When were you in contact
with Vic McQueen?

16:55.766 --> 16:57.476
This morning. We had breakfast.

16:57.601 --> 16:59.853
- How did she seem?
- Fine.

17:00.896 --> 17:02.480
Did she say she was coming here?

17:04.690 --> 17:08.944
I'm just wondering why you came here,
to Bing Partridge's house.

17:12.489 --> 17:14.491
I questioned Vic
the day of your accident,

17:14.616 --> 17:18.203
and she told me
a driverless car ran you down.

17:20.121 --> 17:23.124
If it was Bing Partridge behind
that wheel you need to tell me.

17:24.750 --> 17:26.419
I'm telling you he has Vic.

17:26.544 --> 17:27.878
I believe you.

17:28.753 --> 17:32.549
And I believe you were both at that
bus station because you were scared.

17:33.258 --> 17:36.344
But I didn't have the evidence
to arrest Bing, and I still don't.

17:36.470 --> 17:38.638
I don't know
what you girls got yourself into,

17:38.763 --> 17:41.016
but neither of you
has told me the whole truth.

17:41.600 --> 17:44.059
If you want to see your friend,
tell me everything.

17:46.228 --> 17:48.063
Something you should see, Tabs.

18:22.385 --> 18:26.848
Four thirty-one. I'm at the 207
at 15, Menelar Drive. Copy.

18:27.599 --> 18:29.476
I need a patch on all units.

18:29.601 --> 18:33.145
I've got a suspect at large, wanted
for murder and kidnapping.

18:33.271 --> 18:35.899
Legal name is Bing Partridge,
a white adult male.

18:36.024 --> 18:39.777
Age 42, six-four,
with dark brown hair and a beard.

18:39.902 --> 18:43.030
Drives an '85 Oldsmobile Delta 88,

18:43.154 --> 18:47.451
vehicle tag:
one ultra four, Roger yellow five.

18:47.575 --> 18:49.202
Check all known points of interest,

18:49.328 --> 18:51.538
including
William White Memorial High School

18:51.663 --> 18:53.456
and Sochempharm chemical plant.

18:53.581 --> 18:56.876
Be advised, suspect
is likely armed and dangerous.

18:57.709 --> 18:59.044
He's taken two hostages:

18:59.169 --> 19:02.172
Craig Robert Harrison,
an adult white male, age 18,

19:02.297 --> 19:04.216
five-eight, with shaggy brown hair,

19:05.008 --> 19:09.220
and a white female, age 18,
five-six with brown hair.

19:09.345 --> 19:11.264
Her legal name is Victoria McQueen.

20:09.358 --> 20:11.610
Please help me.
Get me out!

20:14.738 --> 20:15.947
I got you. Come on.

20:17.407 --> 20:18.908
No, I got you!

20:19.534 --> 20:21.744
Mr. Manx, I caught a girl.
Come see!

20:27.666 --> 20:29.710
- Vic?
- Craig?

20:31.127 --> 20:32.713
Craig, it's me. I'm here.

20:32.838 --> 20:34.464
Oh, my God, Vic,
please let me out!

20:34.590 --> 20:37.425
Hey, what are you doing?
He's my friend.

20:37.550 --> 20:39.844
We're going to play
Scissors for the Drifter.

20:39.969 --> 20:42.013
Unless you want to play with us?

20:44.682 --> 20:47.684
Hey, that's not how you play.
You're not playing by the rules.

20:49.227 --> 20:50.812
Mr. Manx, the girl's cheating!

20:55.400 --> 20:56.651
- Vic...
- It's locked.

20:56.777 --> 20:58.153
We need the keys.

21:00.112 --> 21:02.697
- Please don't leave!
- I'll be back. I promise.

21:25.094 --> 21:26.470
Tag, you're it!

21:51.659 --> 21:52.618
Shit.

22:27.442 --> 22:28.776
Damn it.

22:31.236 --> 22:32.404
The girl's inside.

22:34.740 --> 22:36.199
Mr. Manx!

23:11.857 --> 23:12.941
Victoria!

23:18.029 --> 23:20.198
Victoria McQueen!

23:20.822 --> 23:22.950
Come out and say how-do.

23:38.172 --> 23:39.757
No...

24:23.463 --> 24:27.425
The Shorter Way was impressive
as advertised, young lady.

24:28.425 --> 24:29.760
But now it's gone.

24:33.222 --> 24:35.599
There's nowhere left for you to go.

24:37.643 --> 24:40.688
Except with me to Christmasland.

24:47.819 --> 24:50.947
Victoria, don't make this
harder on yourself. Come on out.

24:52.907 --> 24:54.616
Your turn!

24:54.742 --> 24:58.035
Oh, you don't want to play?
OK, my turn again.

25:15.886 --> 25:17.512
Victoria...

26:25.491 --> 26:29.370
Looks like you've gotten yourself
into quite a pickle, Vic.

26:31.288 --> 26:33.873
Get the hell out of here,
you fricking creep!

26:35.750 --> 26:39.169
It takes a lot of brass
to break into a man's house

26:39.294 --> 26:41.422
and tell him to git.

26:43.632 --> 26:47.010
It doesn't have to end this way.
You can still see Christmasland.

26:49.388 --> 26:50.847
Don't worry, I'll see it.

26:50.972 --> 26:53.099
I'm going to find it
and burn it to the ground.

26:53.224 --> 26:55.643
And I told you
there is but one way to get there.

26:55.768 --> 26:58.145
I had hoped it would be
in the front seat with me,

26:58.270 --> 27:02.191
but as it turns out, it looks like
it'll have to be in the trunk

27:02.315 --> 27:05.151
alongside your loverboy.

27:08.279 --> 27:11.658
You need to let him go.
Craig has nothing to do with this.

27:11.782 --> 27:13.283
He ruined you!

27:20.290 --> 27:22.292
And you broke my old heart, Victoria,

27:22.418 --> 27:25.503
because now, you're not capable
of providing my children

27:25.629 --> 27:28.089
with the love and the care
that they require.

27:29.132 --> 27:33.260
You are, however, capable
of providing them with a proper meal.

27:43.854 --> 27:45.772
Come out, right now.

27:48.065 --> 27:50.234
Or you will be the one to burn.

28:07.458 --> 28:08.876
Pity.

29:05.844 --> 29:07.221
Take her to Christmasland.

29:09.765 --> 29:13.601
No impure girls in Christmasland
today, Bradley.

29:14.435 --> 29:15.937
But not to worry.

29:16.853 --> 29:19.774
There's a snack for you in the trunk.

29:30.741 --> 29:33.078
Fire! Burn it down!

29:33.202 --> 29:35.371
As you wish, child.

30:12.572 --> 30:13.738
Come on.

30:56.862 --> 30:58.571
We've come up empty, Tabs.

30:58.696 --> 31:00.114
Sharon Smith's body was found

31:00.239 --> 31:03.201
less than 24 hours
after Bing Partridge abducted her.

31:03.868 --> 31:05.828
Vic McQueen doesn't have much time.

31:05.952 --> 31:08.788
I need you to get back out there.
Chase down any leads we can.

31:08.915 --> 31:12.459
Get with the neighboring counties.
Do whatever you've got to do.

31:14.793 --> 31:16.421
Where is Bing?

31:56.791 --> 31:58.626
What the hell are you doing,
Partridge?

32:00.919 --> 32:01.795
I quit.

32:02.630 --> 32:04.923
No, Bing. You're fired.

32:05.966 --> 32:08.260
Cops have been around here
looking for you.

32:10.427 --> 32:11.720
Put the phone down.

32:12.346 --> 32:14.223
You think you can talk to me
that way?

32:14.807 --> 32:17.935
I said, put the phone down!

32:20.561 --> 32:21.397
Please.

32:25.650 --> 32:28.987
Great, thank you. I want a report
in two hours if possible. Thanks.

32:29.112 --> 32:30.738
I know where he is.

32:31.531 --> 32:33.740
Bing Partridge.
He's at Sochempharm.

32:33.865 --> 32:37.244
No. We had a unit search a while ago,
high and low. He wasn't there.

32:37.369 --> 32:39.328
He is there now.

32:40.372 --> 32:41.956
Did someone tip you off?

32:54.509 --> 32:56.220
No one tipped me off.

32:56.761 --> 32:58.430
My Scrabble bag did.

32:59.222 --> 33:00.724
I'm a medium.

33:01.558 --> 33:04.810
And my tiles told me that Bing is
at Sochempharm chemical plant.

33:05.352 --> 33:07.187
You wanted the whole truth,
Detective.

33:07.313 --> 33:10.691
The whole truth is that there are
forces at work in this world...

33:16.322 --> 33:19.532
There are people... in this world

33:19.658 --> 33:23.119
with abilities
way beyond your comprehension.

33:25.288 --> 33:26.830
I'm one of them.

33:27.372 --> 33:29.583
Vic McQueen is another.

33:30.584 --> 33:32.711
Charlie Manx is a third.

33:33.337 --> 33:35.297
And he has Vic and Craig.

33:35.422 --> 33:38.007
And she wasn't lying
when she told you

33:38.132 --> 33:40.217
that I was hit by a driverless car.

33:40.843 --> 33:42.345
She was telling the truth.

33:43.763 --> 33:47.640
And I know you didn't believe her
but you have to believe me, now.

33:48.224 --> 33:51.102
Please, Bing Partridge might know
where they are.

35:12.050 --> 35:13.552
Bing Partridge!

35:13.678 --> 35:17.014
We have a warrant for your arrest.
Come out with your hands up.

35:40.910 --> 35:42.912
I hope you never have
to feel what it's like

35:43.036 --> 35:45.290
to disappoint people that you love.

35:46.583 --> 35:47.749
Say goodbye to RISD

35:47.876 --> 35:50.752
because this proves
that you are not ready.

35:51.545 --> 35:54.964
Where did the bridge go?
How did you do that?

35:55.089 --> 35:58.217
The bats... You'll want
to be careful of those bats.

35:58.342 --> 36:00.554
Vic? Vic?

36:00.678 --> 36:03.306
Then I take care of him myself.
And I go down swinging.

36:03.431 --> 36:07.767
Kill him. For me, for Haley,
for the next one.

36:09.436 --> 36:12.147
Vic, you're the only person
that can help me stop this guy.

36:12.272 --> 36:14.191
The only person.
