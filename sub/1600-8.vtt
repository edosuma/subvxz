Previously on Bates Motel...

00:03.800 --> 00:05.245
(DOG BARKS)

00:05.520 --> 00:07.682
NORMA: <i>We can't take
on a dog right now.</i>

00:07.760 --> 00:09.171
NORMAN:
<i>I always wanted a dog.</i>

00:09.240 --> 00:10.366
You know all
families have a dog.

00:10.960 --> 00:13.042
Could you tell me what happened
to the Seafairer Motel?

00:13.320 --> 00:14.526
It's the Bates Motel now.

00:14.600 --> 00:15.965
You know where
I can find Keith Summers?

00:16.360 --> 00:17.361
DYLAN:
<i>He's actually dead.</i>

00:17.440 --> 00:20.569
NORMA: <i>I have nothing more to tell you.
That's the entire truth.</i>

00:20.920 --> 00:22.888
<i>Everything that happened
with Keith Summers,</i>

00:23.000 --> 00:24.809
<i>with deputy Shelby.</i>

00:25.920 --> 00:26.921
<i>You know it all.</i>

00:27.080 --> 00:28.206
DYLAN:
<i>Someone in the motel?</i>

00:28.280 --> 00:30.726
NORMA: <i>This man, he had a standing
reservation at the Seafairer</i>

00:30.840 --> 00:32.125
<i>every two months
for a week.</i>

00:32.200 --> 00:34.043
I would love to have the
same business arrangement

00:34.120 --> 00:36.122
that I had with Keith,
if that's possible.

00:36.640 --> 00:38.529
But it's not anything
illegal, right?

00:38.640 --> 00:39.641
No.

00:39.880 --> 00:41.245
Come here, girl.
(WHIMPERING)

00:42.520 --> 00:44.284
Stay. Stay!

00:50.120 --> 00:51.929
WILL: The art of it
is to recreate

00:52.000 --> 00:55.049
the beauty of motion
in something still.

00:55.920 --> 00:57.649
To create life,
if you will.

01:04.959 --> 01:07.201
Here is where
we'll make incisions.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.484
Then what do you do?

01:09.640 --> 01:11.927
Well, then you have to
take everything out.

01:12.120 --> 01:13.690
I'm sorry. There's no
pretty way to put it.

01:13.800 --> 01:15.928
Oh, no, that's okay.
I figured as much.

01:20.840 --> 01:22.365
Now... (CLEARS THROAT)

01:22.440 --> 01:26.525

stages of how it works.

01:41.680 --> 01:43.523
I'm sorry you lost
your friend here.

01:45.320 --> 01:47.288
It just seems sad
to let her go.

01:47.520 --> 01:50.888
You know, dishonorable, sort of,
just to put her in the ground.

01:51.560 --> 01:54.291
(CHUCKLES)
I think she was lonely.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.326
I understand.

01:57.400 --> 01:58.731
(CLATTERING)

02:00.880 --> 02:04.043
Well, I think what you do to
these animals is... amazing.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.880
Come and help me. I can teach you how it works.
You might enjoy it.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.764
Once you get past the blood
and the guts of it all,

02:10.840 --> 02:12.205
it's really quite
beautiful work,

02:12.600 --> 02:15.126
if you're at all artistic, which
I have a feeling you might be.

02:16.680 --> 02:18.250
Thank you, Mr. Decody.

HAYDEN:
I feel so bad for him.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.491
He's always just staring
at her like a lost puppy.

02:42.560 --> 02:43.925
LISSA: Yeah,
it's a little pathetic.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.923
HAYDEN:
He's a little pathetic.

02:46.160 --> 02:47.969
JENNA: Yeah, Norman's nice,
but he's really weird.

02:48.600 --> 02:51.046
The way he just stares
into space like that.

02:51.120 --> 02:52.326
(GIRLS LAUGH)

02:52.440 --> 02:55.011
LISSA: He's the definition
of socially challenged.

02:55.080 --> 02:58.129
I mean, he can't actually think
he has a shot with her, right?

02:58.240 --> 02:59.810
He's not that
out of reality.

03:00.480 --> 03:03.245
Bradley's so nice. She
just felt sorry for him.

03:03.760 --> 03:06.411
I think she thinks of him
as more of pet than a guy.

03:06.480 --> 03:09.051
Like, really, like she would ever
have sex with someone like that.

03:09.120 --> 03:11.441
LISSA: Ugh! No way.
He can't be that stupid.

03:13.480 --> 03:16.051
Well, maybe
you better talk to her,

03:16.960 --> 03:18.166
because she did.

03:18.480 --> 03:20.608
I don't think you know
what we're talking about.

03:20.720 --> 03:22.848
Actually, I don't think you
know what you're talking about.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.809
Bradley had sex
with Norman.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.129
Sex, as in
carnal-back-and-forth.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.282
Maybe she has sex
with all her pets.

03:30.920 --> 03:31.921
I don't know.

03:32.280 --> 03:33.805
But you should really get
your facts straight

03:33.880 --> 03:37.362
before you shoot your mouth off
with your demeaning opinions.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.089
And you've got
toilet paper on your shoe.

03:45.280 --> 03:46.327
Hmm.

Well, can you please leave
a message that I called?

05:09.520 --> 05:11.727
Yeah, we just brought in the
harvest from the Red Creek field.

05:11.800 --> 05:14.406
I need you and Remo to go down to
California and pick up the trimmers.

05:14.840 --> 05:15.841
Yeah, okay.

are trimmers?

(CHUCKLES) <i>Yeah, you get
Remo to explain it to you.</i>

05:25.880 --> 05:27.450
He's made the run
about 20 times.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.050
It was Gil.

05:33.120 --> 05:35.487
He wants us to go down to Fortuna
and pick up the trimmers.

05:35.560 --> 05:38.211
What exactly are
trimmers? Really?

05:39.760 --> 05:41.125
You don't know
what a trimmer is?

05:41.200 --> 05:42.361
Why don't you
explain it to me?

Ronny and Don.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.689
I'll get the van.
You can pack up.

05:51.800 --> 05:52.881
Wait, wait.
Pack what?

05:53.440 --> 05:55.124
It's an overnight
trip, nimrod.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.403
Pack a change
of clothes, or not.

05:58.600 --> 06:00.568
You want me to come over
and tell you what to wear?

Okay, let's...
Let's just go.

06:02.280 --> 06:03.691
Hey, yo! Let's go!

06:10.280 --> 06:11.930
Why did you tell everyone?

06:12.320 --> 06:13.446
Tell everyone what?

06:14.120 --> 06:15.963
About you and I,
what happened that night.

06:16.640 --> 06:17.641
I didn't tell anyone.

06:17.800 --> 06:20.770
You told Emma Decody, because she
told everyone in the girls' bathroom.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.922
I'm sorry. I... I don't
know why she would do that.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.570
Listen, it's just
not cool, Norman.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.404
Okay.
But why isn't it?

06:30.160 --> 06:31.207
I mean,
it happened, right?

06:31.440 --> 06:32.805
Yeah, but it
shouldn't have.

06:32.920 --> 06:35.764
We need to forget about it.
I have a boyfriend, okay?

06:37.800 --> 06:39.564
I don't want
people to know.

06:39.640 --> 06:41.165
Just forget it happened.

Excuse me, Norman.

07:11.760 --> 07:13.410
What is going on?

07:14.160 --> 07:15.730
I have to leave.
Why?

07:17.920 --> 07:19.126
I just have to.

07:19.200 --> 07:20.770
Well, do you have a note?

07:20.840 --> 07:22.251
You have to
have a note.

07:22.320 --> 07:24.448
Norman, you cannot just walk
away from school and leave.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.129
You'll get cited.
You'll get suspended.

I don't care!

wanted me to come and clean the room.

08:03.160 --> 08:04.286
Will you be leaving soon?

08:04.640 --> 08:06.290
You can come in and clean it now.
That's fine.

08:06.560 --> 08:08.369
Oh, no, that's okay. I'll come
back later when you're gone.

08:08.520 --> 08:09.726

08:12.160 --> 08:13.924
I'd like my room
made up now.

08:19.080 --> 08:20.764
I was in town
last night. I...

08:23.320 --> 08:25.891
Heard there was an unpleasant
incident here recently.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.010
A dog got hit out front.

08:29.320 --> 08:30.685
No.

08:31.080 --> 08:32.969
I heard Zack Shelby
got shot here.

08:37.720 --> 08:39.609
Right up there,
on those steps.

08:46.320 --> 08:47.765
Yeah, he did.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.808
It's funny.
You never know someone.

08:52.320 --> 08:56.928
I knew Keith Summers all these years.
Not well, but I knew him.

08:58.360 --> 09:01.125
And here he was.
He's in the motel for this...

09:02.760 --> 09:03.921
sex trade.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.124
You just never know,
do you?

It's no worries.

09:37.600 --> 09:39.250
Did you know Zack Shelby?

09:41.000 --> 09:42.445
Did I know him?

09:44.520 --> 09:47.524
A little. I guess like how
you knew Keith Summers.

09:48.960 --> 09:50.371
So not so much?

09:52.120 --> 09:53.531
No, not so much.

10:02.720 --> 10:05.007
I'm sorry. I have to, um...
I just remembered.

10:05.080 --> 10:06.366
I have to give my son
a ride somewhere.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.843
He's not here. Yeah.

10:09.640 --> 10:11.369
Yeah, I saw him leave.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.206
School, wasn't it?

10:17.480 --> 10:19.881
I got to go.
I'm gonna come back

10:19.960 --> 10:21.849
and I'll finish up later,
okay?

10:30.520 --> 10:32.124
I just... Just...

10:36.000 --> 10:37.286
We're good for now.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.687

I'll come by the office.

11:02.760 --> 11:04.091
Sheriff Romero
can see you now.

11:05.600 --> 11:07.523
So what can I help
you with, Mrs. Bates?

11:07.600 --> 11:11.241
Oh, please, call me Norma, after
everything we've been through.

11:13.920 --> 11:15.922
You know that I called
your office this morning.

11:16.600 --> 11:17.806
You know, I was coming
in town anyway.

11:17.880 --> 11:20.281
I thought, oh, I'll just
pop in and see him.

11:23.560 --> 11:25.164
So anyway, um...

11:27.120 --> 11:28.849
You know, I bought the
motel a few months ago,

11:28.920 --> 11:31.730
and no one told me
at the time

11:31.800 --> 11:33.962
that the city's planning
on building a new bypass

11:34.040 --> 11:36.884
that would basically
take my motel off the map.

11:37.880 --> 11:38.961
Mmm-hmm.

11:39.960 --> 11:44.329
So I'm just trying to
figure out a way that, um,

11:44.400 --> 11:46.482
I can fight this
from the inside.

11:49.840 --> 11:51.490
Well, I, um...

11:52.120 --> 11:55.488
I see that there's a seat open
on the city planning committee,

11:55.840 --> 11:58.730
and I wanted you
to put me forward for it.

11:59.040 --> 12:00.724
Maybe I can influence
their decision.

12:03.040 --> 12:04.326
Why would I do that?

12:07.560 --> 12:09.801
Because I thought
you would.

12:10.280 --> 12:11.327
Why?

12:12.480 --> 12:14.164
Because“.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.843
Because of what
we've been through.

12:17.600 --> 12:21.844
Because we know things
about each other.

12:23.320 --> 12:25.129
We don't owe
each other anything.

12:27.040 --> 12:28.451
We're not friends.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.642
You don't know me in any social
sense, other than as your sheriff.

12:35.600 --> 12:38.604
Don't assume differently just 'cause I
was kind enough to save your ass once.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.446
Excuse me, but weren't you
saving your own ass at the time?

12:42.000 --> 12:44.810
I mean, the fact is that your
deputy was doing all of this

12:44.880 --> 12:47.486
right under your nose, and
you knew nothing about it.

12:47.560 --> 12:49.847
I mean, that's not how
you rewrote the story.

12:56.120 --> 12:59.169
Are you trying to say that you
have something on me? Is that it?

13:00.240 --> 13:03.722
'Cause if you did, that really
wouldn't be good for you, okay?

13:03.800 --> 13:05.529

13:06.360 --> 13:08.010

ground, you know.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.763
Don't ever try
to intimidate me.

Don't walk into my office and ask me
for political favors based on nothing.

no connection.

that we are.

13:57.240 --> 13:58.321
<i>This is Tom Hudgins.</i>

13:58.440 --> 14:01.091
<i>I'm the principal of
White Pine Bay High School.</i>

14:01.160 --> 14:03.208
<i>We'd like you to come
in this afternoon.</i>

14:03.320 --> 14:06.085
<i>We need to discuss your
son's behavior at school.</i>

14:17.000 --> 14:19.765
Can you go on the internet,
find out what a trimmer is?

14:20.960 --> 14:22.086
Yeah.

14:24.320 --> 14:26.243
Trimmers are the guys who
cut and process the weed,

14:26.320 --> 14:28.209
and they turn the raw
plants into final product.

14:28.280 --> 14:29.691
The man's a scholar.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.924
No rust on you,
bubba.

14:32.280 --> 14:33.805
Come on, get in.

14:41.640 --> 14:44.803
Hey. I didn't see you
at school today.

14:45.120 --> 14:47.487
Oh, I wasn't feeling good.
I went home early.

14:47.640 --> 14:48.846
Are you okay?

14:52.320 --> 14:53.924
Why did you tell all the
girls I slept with Bradley?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.126
It just came up.

14:59.120 --> 15:00.167
Sort of.

15:00.720 --> 15:01.926
Just like it came up
with my mom?

15:04.760 --> 15:05.886
Did your mom
tell you that?

15:05.960 --> 15:07.644
No, she didn't have to.

15:10.680 --> 15:11.806
I just don't understand.

15:11.960 --> 15:14.531
(STUTTERING)
What're you trying to do?

15:16.680 --> 15:17.966
I'm sorry.

15:21.560 --> 15:22.925
Bradley was really upset.

15:25.320 --> 15:27.561
Don't ever tell anyone something I
tell you in confidence again, okay?

15:28.560 --> 15:29.686
Okay-

15:37.080 --> 15:40.084
Leaving school without
permission is a serious offense.

15:40.160 --> 15:41.605
He's gonna be suspended
for three days.

15:42.360 --> 15:44.806
Well, he came home. He just
wasn't feeling that well.

15:45.040 --> 15:47.646
He didn't seem sick when I saw him.
He seemed upset.

15:48.520 --> 15:49.885
No, he wasn't upset.

15:50.040 --> 15:52.441
Well, I tried to tell him that
he couldn't leave campus,

15:52.520 --> 15:54.363
and he was
practically shaking.

15:55.040 --> 15:58.123
I took his arm to lead him back in, and
he pulled it away pretty violently.

15:58.440 --> 16:00.249
Are you supposed to be putting
your hands on the students?

16:00.360 --> 16:02.840
Um, I think we should
stick with the issue here.

16:03.720 --> 16:07.122
Ms. Bates, what we've observed
and what we're concerned about

16:07.200 --> 16:09.009
is your son's
emotional instability.

16:10.680 --> 16:11.727
Instability?

16:17.560 --> 16:21.406
He is emotionally unusual
for a boy his age.

16:23.360 --> 16:25.249
He doesn't interact
much with others.

16:25.560 --> 16:26.686
He keeps to himself a lot.

16:28.240 --> 16:30.891
And based on the behavior
that I have seen,

16:31.240 --> 16:33.004
Principal Hudgins
and I would like

16:33.080 --> 16:34.730
him to speak with one of
the school psychologists.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.767
I don't know if I want
him to be doing that.

16:39.560 --> 16:40.607
And why is that?

16:41.960 --> 16:46.648
Because I would
rather that he...

16:46.760 --> 16:47.761
(CLICKS TONGUE)

16:47.840 --> 16:50.764
You know, I think that he should
see a private psychologist.

16:51.520 --> 16:53.170
You know, I would like
to choose the therapist.

16:54.400 --> 16:55.765
Okay-

16:56.760 --> 16:59.161
Well, I think that therapy would
be very beneficial for him.

16:59.280 --> 17:00.725
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

17:02.440 --> 17:03.771
Yeah, okay.

17:03.840 --> 17:06.684
And, um, perhaps I could get
the name of that therapist

17:06.760 --> 17:09.763
so that I could maybe explain to
him what I've seen in school?

17:09.920 --> 17:13.845
Okay, of course, absolutely.
I will keep in touch. Okay.

17:21.240 --> 17:24.130
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

17:27.760 --> 17:29.489
Ah, there's no liquor
in this drink.

17:32.960 --> 17:34.769
I'm gonna get some sleep.

17:34.840 --> 17:37.810

17:39.320 --> 17:40.481
Boss.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.325
What's your problem?

17:42.880 --> 17:44.166
You've been on my ass
since we met.

17:48.240 --> 17:50.129
Now, I got 23 years,
all right?

17:52.400 --> 17:55.563
23 years' experience, and now
here I am working for you.

17:58.200 --> 17:59.531
You ever wonder
why that might be?

18:01.160 --> 18:02.650
Hmm? Hmm?

18:03.040 --> 18:04.769
Because I think
it's pretty obvious.

18:04.840 --> 18:05.921
Yeah?

18:06.000 --> 18:07.923
Yeah.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.287
In fact, I don't think there's
enough liquor in this entire bar

18:10.400 --> 18:13.006
to make you forget what a pathetic,
self-destructive loser you are.

18:14.840 --> 18:16.080
Want me to kick
your ass right now?

18:17.200 --> 18:20.329
Oh, you're gonna
kick my ass? Really?

18:20.640 --> 18:21.721
That's the funniest joke
you've ever had.

18:21.800 --> 18:22.847

18:56.000 --> 18:58.367
You better watch out
for me, golden boy.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.769
I'll try to destroy you.

19:06.360 --> 19:09.603
REMO: I used to be like you.
The boss loved me.

19:10.120 --> 19:11.690
Gave me a chance
to step up.

19:12.960 --> 19:14.564
Yeah.

19:15.360 --> 19:16.691
What happened?

19:17.320 --> 19:19.800
I don't have
leadership potential.

19:22.040 --> 19:23.530
What'd you do?

19:24.640 --> 19:27.769
I'm not what you would call
consistently reliable.

19:29.640 --> 19:31.768
Now nobody respects me.
Nobody.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.249
You say you've been working
for Gil for 23 years?

19:36.360 --> 19:38.442
Yep. No, not Gil.

19:39.480 --> 19:40.925
Big boss.

19:41.600 --> 19:42.726
Who's that?

19:44.760 --> 19:46.285
You'll know when
you need to know.

19:51.840 --> 19:53.604
Why do you stay?
What?

19:54.360 --> 19:55.771
I mean, if you don't like
it, then why do you stay?

19:56.360 --> 19:57.885
If no one respects you,
why don't you quit?

19:57.960 --> 19:59.291
(CHUCKLES)

19:59.520 --> 20:01.602
Quit? Oh, no,
no, no, no.

20:01.720 --> 20:02.960
There's no quitting
in this job.

20:03.960 --> 20:05.883
No, you can't quit. No.

20:06.480 --> 20:08.005
You could get fired, though.

20:09.680 --> 20:11.967
You don't want that to
happen to you, believe me.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.642
Anyway, good night.

20:41.480 --> 20:42.925
Mother.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.446
I'm sorry, you know, about
what happened at school.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.801
(INHALES)
What did happen?

20:50.320 --> 20:51.765
Well, I got upset.

20:51.840 --> 20:53.683
About what? I don't
want to talk about it.

20:56.760 --> 20:58.569
You know, I promise
it won't happen again.

20:59.240 --> 21:00.685
It can't happen.

21:01.120 --> 21:03.248
Because now they want
you to go see a therapist.

21:03.360 --> 21:04.521
I mean, this is all gonna
go on your record.

21:04.640 --> 21:06.369
You have to be
more careful.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.090
You have to try
to fit in, Norman.

21:09.160 --> 21:11.606
You can't go around being
so emotional all the time.

21:11.680 --> 21:13.523
I know, mother,
and I'm sorry.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.445
But I do think I fit in,

21:18.200 --> 21:19.531
for the most part.

21:23.560 --> 21:25.528
Oh, can you give me a
ride to Emma's shop?

21:25.960 --> 21:27.007
Yeah, why?

21:27.080 --> 21:29.845
I'm working with her dad. He's
teaching me how to do taxidermy.

21:47.200 --> 21:49.521
Will, this is my mom.

21:52.200 --> 21:53.486
I'm Norma Bates.

21:53.560 --> 21:54.925
You can call me Will.

21:55.040 --> 21:58.408
Will, I'm wondering if we
could have a word in private.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.445
Yeah, of course.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.727
Norman, would you
give us a minute, please?

22:03.000 --> 22:04.081
Mmm.

22:11.920 --> 22:13.001
Please.

22:13.080 --> 22:14.525
Thank you.

22:26.280 --> 22:28.760
I don't know if this is such a
good thing for Norman to be doing.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.206
No?
Mmm.

22:31.440 --> 22:33.442
He's already sort of...

22:37.680 --> 22:39.967
(SOFTLY) Sort of
an unusual boy.

22:41.480 --> 22:43.562
You know, he has
a hard time fitting in.

22:43.640 --> 22:45.290
He gets upset very easily.

22:45.360 --> 22:46.486
Really?
Yeah.

22:46.560 --> 22:49.006
He's always very calm
when he's here working.

22:49.080 --> 22:50.241
But hobbies
can be good that way.

22:50.520 --> 22:51.806
Oh, of course.

22:53.480 --> 22:55.960
I just don't want him getting
labeled as a freak or anything.

22:57.160 --> 22:59.731
And I don't think that
learning taxidermy

22:59.800 --> 23:01.290
necessarily makes one
a freak.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.926
No! No, no. I'm not saying
that you're a freak.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.401
No, that's not what I'm saying at all.
Not at all.

23:06.480 --> 23:07.925
Uh-huh.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.650
I'm... (LAUGHS)
I'm not saying that.

23:09.760 --> 23:11.489
Oh, no.
Um...

23:14.120 --> 23:16.487
I'm... I'm just saying that
not a lot of people do it.

23:18.560 --> 23:21.962
Not many people write poetry, but
we still have to have poets, right?

23:23.360 --> 23:25.806
He's good at it,
and he's good company.

23:27.280 --> 23:30.011
We're not hurting anyone.
The animals are already dead.

23:31.120 --> 23:34.488
So what's the harm in letting a
young person follow their passion?

23:35.400 --> 23:36.686
What can go wrong
with that?

23:48.320 --> 23:50.004
Ugh. There he is.

23:50.320 --> 23:51.446

to White Pine Bay?

23:56.000 --> 23:57.525
What does it
look like, douchebag?

23:58.200 --> 23:59.565
You're an hour late,
by the way.

24:05.520 --> 24:06.931
Hey-

24:08.240 --> 24:10.163
That guy right there,

24:10.520 --> 24:11.965
I remember him
from last year.

24:12.040 --> 24:13.371
He's a complete
pain in the ass.

24:13.440 --> 24:14.885
We should
leave him behind.

24:16.280 --> 24:17.884
Gil said we should
bring all of them.

24:17.960 --> 24:19.291
I think
we should do that.

24:20.800 --> 24:22.245
Whatever.

24:23.880 --> 24:26.247
NORMAN: (CHUCKLES)
You're so good at this.

24:26.360 --> 24:27.521
Have you done it
your whole life?

24:27.600 --> 24:29.329
WILL: Pretty much, yeah.

24:29.400 --> 24:32.085
I stopped for about 10 years,
though, when I was married.

24:33.200 --> 24:35.168
Yeah, Emma's mom
didn't like it much.

24:35.920 --> 24:37.843
Didn't like me
very much either.

24:39.280 --> 24:41.248
But I rediscovered myself
after she left.

24:42.080 --> 24:43.127
I'm sorry, Will.

24:46.400 --> 24:47.640
It's okay.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.482
I left that life behind,
in England.

24:52.760 --> 24:55.286
And I got Emma.
So that's all that matters.

I think
you're following me.

what you're talking about.

I don't have anything.

idea what you're talking about.

Well, my guess is, once you think
about it, you'll remember.

29:34.360 --> 29:36.328
When you do,
come by my hotel room.

29:36.760 --> 29:40.003

about it. Okay?

was devastating, of course.

and we're doing our best to start
over and reinvent our lives.

30:17.320 --> 30:18.560
Yes.

how it felt to move

from the home where you lived with
your dad to a whole new town?

30:30.840 --> 30:34.447
Yeah. (CLEARS THROAT) Yeah,

I guess I felt
a lot of things.

31:15.640 --> 31:18.371
My head is about
to explode.

31:18.480 --> 31:19.970
I can't listen
to any more of his crap.

31:20.960 --> 31:23.930
XANDER: You all remember this
pus ball from last year, right?

31:25.120 --> 31:27.691
I think I'm gonna tell Gil we're
not coming back next year.

31:30.400 --> 31:31.925
And it's past lunch.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.889
It's time for you to pull
over and buy us a meal.

31:33.960 --> 31:35.200
We'll stop in a while.

31:36.320 --> 31:39.324
Management here seems to think he
can tell us when we're gonna eat.

31:40.640 --> 31:43.803
We want to stop, man!
We want to stop.

31:43.960 --> 31:45.007
Remo, pull over.

31:55.320 --> 31:56.606
Get out.

31:57.600 --> 31:59.682
Get out and what? You want
me to watch you piss?

32:00.680 --> 32:03.251
No, I want you to get out
of the van right now.

32:04.520 --> 32:06.090
You, your guitar,

32:06.160 --> 32:09.801
and anyone else who thinks this is
a democracy, you can get out, too!

32:12.000 --> 32:14.526
Stop for lunch whenever, man.
It's all good.

32:14.800 --> 32:16.131
I said get out!

32:18.920 --> 32:20.206
Let's go!

32:23.960 --> 32:26.691
Walk over here. Go on.

32:45.200 --> 32:46.565
Thank you.

32:47.480 --> 32:49.448
So same time
next week, Norman?

32:50.600 --> 32:53.490
Well, I'm gonna call
and schedule something,

32:53.560 --> 32:57.531
but we have a lot going on
with the motel opening.

32:59.400 --> 33:01.607
May I talk to you
privately for a moment?

33:04.080 --> 33:06.686
Mmm, yeah. Yeah, I'll
be right out, Norman.

33:19.200 --> 33:20.406
Um...

33:22.080 --> 33:25.687
I think it might be helpful if I
saw Norman on his own next time.

33:26.960 --> 33:29.566
No offense, but I don't
feel comfortable with that.

33:31.080 --> 33:32.605
I mean,
I don't know you.

33:35.760 --> 33:38.127
Have you ever been
in therapy, Mrs. Bates?

33:40.560 --> 33:41.800
No.

33:42.720 --> 33:45.690
Would you consider coming for
some sessions of your own?

33:47.280 --> 33:48.566
Why?

33:48.720 --> 33:51.007
Well, I've noticed

33:51.080 --> 33:53.481
you have a strong
influence on Norman,

33:54.280 --> 33:56.123
maybe a need
to control things.

33:57.680 --> 33:59.170
I'm his mother.
(CHUCKLES)

33:59.440 --> 34:00.805
Of course.

34:00.880 --> 34:03.690
But as our children grow older,
we need to let go a little.

34:04.120 --> 34:05.531
Hmm?

34:07.000 --> 34:08.570
The thing is, um...

34:09.719 --> 34:13.327
People who feel the need
to control everything

34:13.800 --> 34:17.521
often, in actuality, feel out
of control on the inside.

34:19.360 --> 34:20.646
Do you ever
feel that way?

34:20.800 --> 34:22.370
(INHALES SHARPLY)

34:25.320 --> 34:27.527
No, I don't.

34:29.199 --> 34:30.610
(STUTTERS)

34:32.199 --> 34:35.522
I feel completely in control
of everything in my life.

34:36.960 --> 34:39.884
How dare you make these
stupid assumptions about me.

34:39.960 --> 34:41.724
You don't know
anything about me.

34:42.159 --> 34:44.128
I work hard.
I take care of my son.

34:44.480 --> 34:46.208
I know what's right and
what's wrong for him.

34:46.280 --> 34:48.282
No one pushes me around.
I control my own life.

34:48.360 --> 34:50.931
I'm in total control of my own life.
I have a lot going on.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.081
I have a lot to deal with,

34:52.159 --> 34:55.130
but I do not
feel powerless, ever!

34:57.720 --> 34:58.846
(SIGHS)
We're going, Norman.

34:58.920 --> 35:00.763
What happened, Mother?
Did I say something wrong?

35:00.840 --> 35:02.490
No, you were perfect.
Let's go.

35:15.520 --> 35:18.000
Norman, go up to the house.
I'll be right there.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.770
Okay, Mom.

35:31.600 --> 35:32.931
Come on in.

35:33.600 --> 35:37.127
I'd offer you a drink, but I
can't seem to find a mini bar.

35:37.600 --> 35:40.888
Here's your money back.
I want you out of my motel!

35:43.760 --> 35:44.886
You didn't just
do that, did you?

35:45.000 --> 35:47.731
Look, I don't know who you
are, and I don't care,

35:47.800 --> 35:50.280
but I don't want to have
anything more to do with you.

35:50.520 --> 35:52.921
Okay? We are not having
future business together.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.002
You are not booking rooms
here ever again.

35:55.080 --> 35:56.889
You need to dial it down
right now, Norma,

35:56.960 --> 35:58.291
before I get
truly annoyed.

35:58.880 --> 36:01.963
You want me to call the cops and tell
them what you've been saying to me?

36:02.040 --> 36:06.284
Hmm? How you wanted to rent
rooms and have "privacy"?

36:06.440 --> 36:09.171
How you knew Keith
Summers and Zack Shelby?

36:11.280 --> 36:13.009
I know all about
you and Zack Shelby.

36:18.400 --> 36:19.606
What?
There's nothing to know.

36:24.280 --> 36:25.930
I'm not afraid of you.

36:26.440 --> 36:28.124
You have no power
over me.

36:28.280 --> 36:30.248
You were gonna try and convince
me that you and Shelby

36:30.320 --> 36:33.608
were casual acquaintances, that you
knew nothing about what was going on?

36:37.440 --> 36:41.809
If you are not out of this room in
five minutes, lam calling the police.

36:42.320 --> 36:44.891
Okay. You want to play?

36:46.320 --> 36:47.446
We'll play-

36:47.800 --> 36:49.404
Five minutes!

37:23.840 --> 37:24.887
(ENGINE STARTS)

37:33.640 --> 37:34.846
(TIRES SCREECH)

37:41.120 --> 37:42.406
Hey-

37:46.600 --> 37:49.843
Can we talk?
Mmm, yeah.

37:59.560 --> 38:02.370
The reason I told those
girls about you and Bradley

38:02.440 --> 38:03.965
is because I heard them
talking about you,

38:05.200 --> 38:06.725
saying things like,

38:06.880 --> 38:10.168
it was embarrassing how you just
stared at Bradley all the time

38:10.240 --> 38:11.890
and how someone like her

38:11.960 --> 38:14.008
would never have anything to
do with someone like you.

38:18.200 --> 38:19.201
Oh.

38:19.680 --> 38:21.569
And it just made me
so angry,

38:22.760 --> 38:25.081
because I think
you are so special

38:25.160 --> 38:26.924
and so much better
than any of them.

38:29.560 --> 38:30.925
I just couldn't keep
my mouth shut.

38:33.280 --> 38:34.725
Anyway, I'm sorry.

38:35.880 --> 38:37.882
I just didn't want you to
think I had any other motive.

38:46.040 --> 38:47.610
I know you think
I like you.

38:48.560 --> 38:51.291
And, okay,
I guess I do, but...

38:54.600 --> 38:55.601
It's not about that.

38:57.600 --> 39:00.410
I don't care if you're not
gonna be my boyfriend.

39:01.920 --> 39:05.049
I'm pretty used to things not
turning out the way I expect

39:05.120 --> 39:06.201
and making the best of it.

39:08.600 --> 39:09.965
It's just...

39:12.120 --> 39:14.521
You are really
special to me.

39:16.160 --> 39:17.730
And I feel safe with you.

39:23.280 --> 39:24.611
You are my friend,

39:27.280 --> 39:30.727
and I don't want to
mess that up or lose you.

39:36.680 --> 39:38.284
I don't have
many real friends.

39:39.680 --> 39:41.045
(CHUCKLES)

39:45.080 --> 39:46.320
It's okay, Emma.

39:49.880 --> 39:51.644
I'm sorry I was mad.

40:01.640 --> 40:03.483
I'm... I'm sorry. If there was
a door, I would have knocked.

40:04.880 --> 40:06.450
It's fine, Dad.
(CHUCKLES)

40:34.720 --> 40:36.563
How many rooms
we got available?

40:36.640 --> 40:39.211
All of them.
12 rooms, 12 vacancies.

40:42.200 --> 40:43.804
What happened
to number nine?

40:44.360 --> 40:47.523
You were right about that guy.
So I got rid of him.

40:47.920 --> 40:49.001
I handled it.

40:50.640 --> 40:52.722
Cool. Um...

40:53.600 --> 40:55.887
Look, I got seven people
here who need rooms.

40:56.280 --> 40:57.520
They're gonna be doing
some work for my boss,

40:57.680 --> 40:59.967
and we need somewhere to put
'em for the next two weeks.

41:00.040 --> 41:01.246
Really?

41:02.920 --> 41:05.810
Yeah! Yeah. Well, I'll
go open the office.

41:07.560 --> 41:08.800
Thank you, Dylan.

41:10.120 --> 41:11.770
Yeah, sure, Norma.

41:19.080 --> 41:22.448
You know, Norman is staying
for dinner at Emma's tonight.

41:22.880 --> 41:24.166
Do you want to go get a
bite in the village?

41:24.240 --> 41:26.049
It would just be
the two of us.

41:27.480 --> 41:29.289
Yeah.
Yeah?

41:29.360 --> 41:31.522
Yeah, sure. Okay.

41:32.280 --> 41:34.931
Okay. I'm just gonna
get out of these clothes.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.241
I'll run upstairs, and then
I'll come back down to meet you

41:37.320 --> 41:39.800
and settle everybody in.
Okay?

41:40.240 --> 41:41.446
Okay-

41:41.840 --> 41:43.604
(CHUCKLES) Okay.

42:09.440 --> 42:11.966
On! (SCREAMS)

42:12.240 --> 42:13.321
Oh, God!

42:13.400 --> 42:15.880
Norman! Norman!

42:16.440 --> 42:17.851
(SCREAMS)

42:18.640 --> 42:19.971
Norman! Norman!
