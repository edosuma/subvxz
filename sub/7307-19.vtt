WEBVTT

00:08.983 --> 00:10.864
Damn it.
Now I know they're doing it on purpose.

00:10.943 --> 00:11.975
Who?

00:12.070 --> 00:13.943
The guys installing
the new fire alarm system.

00:14.030 --> 00:15.275
That's the third time this week

00:15.365 --> 00:17.902
the damn thing's gone off
an hour after they quit work.

00:17.992 --> 00:19.901
Aren't you going
to call the fire department?

00:19.994 --> 00:21.073
It's a false alarm.

00:21.162 --> 00:23.238
It's payback
for them having to sign in and out.

00:23.331 --> 00:25.573
You're not supposed
to use the elevator in a fire.

00:25.666 --> 00:27.244
There's no fire, George.

00:27.335 --> 00:29.790
And I'm not walking up five floors
for a false alarm.

00:29.879 --> 00:34.007
- Can't you shut it off here?
- Don't you think I would if I could?

00:34.092 --> 00:37.425
They haven't connected that circuit yet.
On purpose.

01:47.990 --> 01:49.734
Special Agent Todd's desk.

01:50.534 --> 01:53.286
- I'm sorry, she stepped away.
- DiNozzo.

01:53.371 --> 01:56.953
May I ask who's calling?
One moment, Dwayne.

01:57.583 --> 01:58.746
I do have voice mail.

01:58.834 --> 02:00.661
- What fun is that?
- Hi.

02:00.878 --> 02:02.669
Yeah, me, too.

02:05.716 --> 02:10.377
Yeah. I know where that is.
Okay, great. I'm leaving now. Bye.

02:10.721 --> 02:12.381
His name is Dwayne?

02:13.766 --> 02:16.304
You really need
to get a social life of your own.

02:16.394 --> 02:19.845
- I have a social life.
- What's tonight, Celebrity Mole?

02:19.939 --> 02:22.477
- No, Best of Jackass.
- Hold on!

02:27.863 --> 02:29.488
What is it, boss?

02:31.367 --> 02:33.324
Chris Pacci was murdered.

02:33.828 --> 02:35.904
The agent that sits behind me?

02:40.918 --> 02:42.377
- Hey, Pacci.
- Tony.

02:42.461 --> 02:44.418
- How's the shoulder?
- It's getting there.

02:44.505 --> 02:46.414
- You got a minute, Gibbs?
- No, not really.

02:48.050 --> 02:50.541
Pacci, what do you need?

02:50.636 --> 02:53.756
You're busy. It's a cold case.
What's one more day?

03:08.738 --> 03:11.442
- Detective Hanley.
- Special Agent Gibbs.

03:13.617 --> 03:14.898
Thanks for the call.

03:14.994 --> 03:18.445
When we ID'd him as NCIS,
I assumed you'd want to take the lead.

03:18.539 --> 03:22.916
- Appreciate that. Who found the body?
- The janitor and the security guard.

03:23.002 --> 03:24.723
They were alerted
when a fire alarm went off

03:24.754 --> 03:26.461
on the fifth floor.

03:27.423 --> 03:30.293
- On our way up.
- We held off on taking their statements.

03:30.384 --> 03:34.761
- Thought you'd want to do that.
- Oh, Christopher, who did this to you?

03:38.559 --> 03:40.884
It's easier to overcome
the gore and inhumanity

03:40.978 --> 03:42.218
when you don't know the victim.

03:42.271 --> 03:44.892
But it's so hard

03:45.274 --> 03:47.682
to be detached
when it's one of your own.

03:47.777 --> 03:49.935
Should I start taking photos,
Dr Mallard?

03:50.029 --> 03:53.065
Yeah. Work goes on.

03:54.283 --> 03:56.952
I called 911
and someone left the building

03:57.036 --> 03:59.443
through the rear emergency exit
setting off the door alarm.

03:59.538 --> 04:02.658
- Did the security cameras catch him?
- They're not installed yet.

04:02.750 --> 04:06.830
I mean, the building's being retrofitted
with new systems and nothing's on line.

04:06.921 --> 04:08.415
What time did Chr...

04:11.717 --> 04:13.674
What time did the victim
enter the building?

04:13.761 --> 04:15.800
I don't remember seeing him come in.

04:15.888 --> 04:17.382
- Is there another entrance?
- No.

04:17.473 --> 04:20.723
- He would've had to come through here.
- How could you not see him?

04:20.810 --> 04:23.680
- Does this lobby get that busy?
- He could've come in

04:23.771 --> 04:26.641
while I was
signing construction workers out.

04:26.732 --> 04:29.437
I want a copy of their names
and a list of the floors they work on.

04:29.527 --> 04:30.641
Yes, sir.

04:40.996 --> 04:43.203
Bastard disembowelled him.

04:43.290 --> 04:46.493
Yes, but I don't think
that was the cause of death.

04:46.794 --> 04:50.044
- Is that a bullet wound?
- Yes, in the neck.

04:50.130 --> 04:53.334
Most likely pierced the carotid artery.

04:53.676 --> 04:54.956
It was a quick death.

04:55.052 --> 04:58.053
He would've bled out
in less than a minute.

04:58.889 --> 05:01.427
Shouldn't there be a lot more blood?

05:01.851 --> 05:05.219
If he was shot in the elevator.

05:05.312 --> 05:07.020
You think it happened topside?

05:07.106 --> 05:11.851
That would be my guess.
But this, this slashing,

05:11.944 --> 05:14.517
was done here in the elevator.

05:17.074 --> 05:18.948
A rage or ritual, Duck?

05:19.326 --> 05:23.110
I don't know, Jethro.
Maybe after I've autopsied him.

05:24.039 --> 05:26.744
Chris asked me for help on a cold case.

05:28.878 --> 05:31.713
I was chasing Curtin
and didn't have time.

05:31.797 --> 05:34.253
- Jethro.
- He said it could wait.

05:35.134 --> 05:38.051
What difference did another day make?

05:39.054 --> 05:43.467
- Jethro, this is not your fault.
- It feels like it is, Ducky.

05:50.232 --> 05:52.189
You found a lot of blood.

05:52.276 --> 05:54.683
- Yeah.
- We're looking for a bullet.

05:54.945 --> 05:56.024
We're on it.

05:56.113 --> 05:59.233
Whatever happened
started on the sixth floor.

05:59.533 --> 06:01.573
We followed the trail backwards.

06:04.788 --> 06:07.077
Pacci made it to the stairwell.

06:08.459 --> 06:10.582
He exited at the fifth floor

06:11.879 --> 06:14.085
where he pulled the fire alarm

06:20.512 --> 06:22.588
before making it to the elevator.

06:39.865 --> 06:41.774
God, Chris was so anal.

06:41.867 --> 06:44.405
I borrowed his stapler once,
put it back in the wrong place,

06:44.495 --> 06:46.322
heard about it for days.

06:51.835 --> 06:53.413
Give me his keys.

07:08.185 --> 07:11.471
Regs are to carry your weapon
from portal to portal.

07:11.563 --> 07:13.473
Why'd he leave his here?

07:15.442 --> 07:17.067
He was tailing somebody

07:18.153 --> 07:20.193
going from place to place.

07:21.448 --> 07:25.660
Didn't want to stop to identify himself
or risk setting off an alarm.

07:25.995 --> 07:27.240
We've all done it

07:27.329 --> 07:29.156
especially with
the heavy security these days.

07:29.248 --> 07:31.917
I'll go over his case files.
You two check out his house.

07:32.001 --> 07:34.456
- Tonight?
- Yes, tonight.

07:36.588 --> 07:38.546
I just got to make a call.

07:39.174 --> 07:41.962
Is there anyone
you need to call, DiNozzo?

07:42.720 --> 07:43.965
No, boss.

07:44.847 --> 07:46.127
No calls.

07:58.986 --> 08:00.694
You know Pacci well?

08:00.988 --> 08:04.024
Softball, beers after work.
That kind of knowing.

08:04.992 --> 08:06.735
When he left this morning
he had no idea

08:06.827 --> 08:08.535
we'd be going through
his personal effects.

08:08.620 --> 08:09.652
Part of the job.

08:09.747 --> 08:11.766
Yeah, but you knew him.
Don't you feel like you're...

08:11.790 --> 08:12.821
What?

08:13.208 --> 08:15.367
I don't know,
like you're invading his privacy?

08:15.461 --> 08:17.584
Well, he's dead, Kate,
with his guts slashed open.

08:17.671 --> 08:21.122
I'd say Chris' privacy
is about as invaded as it's gonna get.

08:34.897 --> 08:37.222
- Hello?
- Is this the Pacci residence?

08:37.316 --> 08:41.265
- Yeah. Who's this?
- NCIS Special Agent McGee.

08:42.654 --> 08:45.276
McGee, it's DiNozzo. What are
you doing calling this number?

08:45.365 --> 08:47.773
Special Agent Pacci
wanted me to do something for him.

08:47.868 --> 08:50.074
- Is he there? Can I speak to him?
- No.

08:50.162 --> 08:51.953
Look, DiNozzo,
this isn't a good time, okay?

08:52.039 --> 08:54.660
- This is...
- He's been murdered, McGee.

08:56.293 --> 08:57.953
What did he ask you to do for him?

08:58.045 --> 09:02.873
He wanted civilian files
from a three-year-old cold case.

09:02.966 --> 09:04.152
I spent all day in the basement

09:04.176 --> 09:06.133
of the Buford County courthouse
searching for it.

09:06.220 --> 09:07.714
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

09:07.805 --> 09:09.631
- What's in it?
- The car accident report.

09:09.723 --> 09:11.134
I didn't think I should read it.

09:11.225 --> 09:13.550
You and the report,
NCIS headquarters, 07:00.

09:13.644 --> 09:14.723
Okay.

09:15.270 --> 09:16.978
- Tony.
- What?

09:18.524 --> 09:19.769
I'm sorry.

09:20.359 --> 09:22.684
Yeah, kid. Aren't we all.

09:28.659 --> 09:32.028
- Get the bullet we found last night?
- I already ran it.

09:32.121 --> 09:34.658
- What time did you get in?
- 4:00 a.m.

09:34.998 --> 09:37.834
- Thanks, Abs.
- Well, Pacci was family.

09:38.710 --> 09:41.747
Slug looks pretty clean from a.357.

09:41.839 --> 09:45.172
Based on rifling, it came
from a Smith & Wesson Model 66.

09:45.259 --> 09:47.085
Very small, easy to conceal.

09:47.177 --> 09:49.668
Yeah. I ran a comparison
through NIBIN.

09:49.763 --> 09:50.794
I got nada.

09:50.889 --> 09:53.926
Looks like the gun's a virgin,
but I'll keep searching.

09:54.017 --> 09:55.097
Yeah.

09:55.352 --> 09:58.555
Abs, Pacci ask you
to do anything for him recently?

09:58.981 --> 10:00.523
Not in a while.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.439
He was working a cold case.

10:03.777 --> 10:06.980
- Search the hard drive on his computer.
- You got it.

10:08.031 --> 10:10.238
Put this back with the others.

10:15.664 --> 10:16.695
What have you found?

10:16.790 --> 10:20.574
Well, as I thought,
the bullet tore through the carotid artery.

10:21.003 --> 10:24.336
The massive loss of blood
while fleeing his attacker

10:24.423 --> 10:26.830
was almost instantaneously fatal.

10:26.925 --> 10:28.550
Was the slashing done postmortem?

10:28.635 --> 10:31.720
I believe so. It's
hard to tell for certain.

10:31.972 --> 10:36.136
I mean, a three-four inch blade
was thrust in here below the sternum

10:36.226 --> 10:37.602
and sliced down to here.

10:37.686 --> 10:41.898
These two more indiscriminate
incisions were done next.

10:42.566 --> 10:45.733
- Same question, rage or ritual?
- Neither.

10:45.903 --> 10:48.228
I think the killer was looking
for something. Here,

10:48.322 --> 10:50.991
there's a small foreign object

10:51.200 --> 10:53.951
lodged here
in the upper alimentary canal.

10:54.036 --> 10:55.411
What is that?

10:55.662 --> 10:57.988
I was about to find out
when you came in.

10:58.081 --> 11:02.245
- Did Chris swallow this?
- That would be my guess, Jethro.

11:02.336 --> 11:04.827
Ducky, would this be hard to find
without an x-ray?

11:04.922 --> 11:06.167
Extremely.

11:07.049 --> 11:09.088
Especially if an alarm was blaring

11:09.176 --> 11:12.130
and the attacker knew
that security had been alerted.

11:20.437 --> 11:21.812
Here we are.

11:22.773 --> 11:24.231
What is that?

11:26.276 --> 11:29.313
It's a memory card, sir.
From a digital camera.

11:30.155 --> 11:33.524
Why on earth would
Christopher swallow a memory card?

11:34.117 --> 11:35.861
He knew he was dying.

11:37.496 --> 11:40.117
And he knew
you'd be doing the autopsy.

11:41.166 --> 11:43.408
Chris wanted you to find that.

11:44.461 --> 11:46.370
Dead man talking, Duck.

11:53.170 --> 11:55.839
Obviously, they're surveillance photos.

11:57.549 --> 11:58.794
Hottie.

11:58.884 --> 12:01.968
Don't you think
she's a little bit too old for you, Tony?

12:02.053 --> 12:03.797
No. She's about my age.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.928
That's exactly my point.

12:06.016 --> 12:08.589
There's nothing on the card
but candids.

12:08.685 --> 12:12.220
Based on the date-time stamp,
they were all taken in the past two days.

12:12.314 --> 12:13.559
I interviewed all the workers.

12:13.648 --> 12:16.318
Nobody remembers seeing Pacci
or anything unusual,

12:16.401 --> 12:17.601
but one of them did find this.

12:17.694 --> 12:20.399
He found it at the bottom
of the stairwell this morning.

12:20.489 --> 12:24.356
- Chris' camera?
- NCIS issued. It's got to be his.

12:31.333 --> 12:33.242
- No memory card?
- Nope.

12:33.335 --> 12:35.161
Sorry, sorry. I'm five minutes late.

12:35.253 --> 12:37.231
I had to park in the visitor's lot
and the guard...

12:37.255 --> 12:38.880
Where is it, McGee?

12:48.433 --> 12:50.058
Special Agent Pacci wanted that ASAP.

12:50.143 --> 12:51.174
What is it?

12:51.269 --> 12:53.345
It's a civil investigation
of an automobile accident

12:53.438 --> 12:55.098
in Buford County three years ago.

12:55.190 --> 12:58.025
Naval officer was killed.
Read it last night.

12:58.610 --> 13:01.445
I didn't have breakfast this morning.
You don't mind, do you?

13:01.530 --> 13:03.688
- No.
- Yes. Tony.

13:04.533 --> 13:06.858
- Hi, McGee.
- Hey.

13:06.952 --> 13:08.197
I remember this case.

13:08.286 --> 13:11.702
Lieutenant Commander Voss was under
investigation for credit card fraud.

13:11.790 --> 13:14.328
He stole over $10 million
from the Navy.

13:14.417 --> 13:16.312
He the guy that died
before they could file charges?

13:16.336 --> 13:17.367
Yep.

13:17.462 --> 13:19.289
The money was never found.
Case went cold.

13:19.381 --> 13:23.295
- Why was Pacci working it?
- Must have found a lead on the money.

13:24.135 --> 13:25.416
Maybe her.

13:30.350 --> 13:31.725
- McGee.
- Yes, boss.

13:31.810 --> 13:34.383
I want you on this.
I'm gonna get you TAD'd here.

13:34.479 --> 13:36.187
DiNozzo, you take McGee with you.

13:36.273 --> 13:38.230
You find out who she is
and where she is.

13:38.316 --> 13:39.727
Let's go, hotshot.

13:41.278 --> 13:43.069
Need a place to stay?

13:45.407 --> 13:47.316
- McGee!
- Coming.

13:49.244 --> 13:51.402
- How'd he die?
- What?

13:51.788 --> 13:54.493
Lieutenant Commander Voss,
how'd he die?

13:57.377 --> 13:59.251
He was burned to death?

14:02.048 --> 14:05.002
Why am I looking
at a three-year-old autopsy report?

14:05.093 --> 14:06.421
Kate's idea.

14:07.929 --> 14:09.756
Chris had this autopsy pulled, Duck.

14:09.848 --> 14:12.054
He must have suspected
something was wrong in it.

14:12.142 --> 14:13.828
I'd be very surprised
if there were, Jethro.

14:13.852 --> 14:15.263
This was done by Hugh Putnam.

14:15.353 --> 14:17.642
He's a very competent
and thorough ME.

14:17.731 --> 14:21.313
- I've worked with him before.
- Check it out anyway.

14:23.778 --> 14:26.530
Please. He's got to learn to say please.

14:28.700 --> 14:30.491
Christopher.

14:30.702 --> 14:33.110
You've left us a bit of a mystery.

14:36.291 --> 14:38.200
Give me some direction.

14:39.461 --> 14:42.960
What should I be looking for
in this autopsy report?

14:50.180 --> 14:52.671
You know, I already told
Special Agent Pacci everything

14:52.766 --> 14:54.842
I could remember
about Commander Voss.

14:54.934 --> 14:57.342
- When was that?
- That would've been Tuesday morning.

14:57.437 --> 14:58.979
You know,
we get under way in two days.

14:59.064 --> 15:01.637
Can't you get whatever info you need
off of Agent Pacci?

15:01.733 --> 15:04.014
I mean, I can't tell you any more
than I already told him.

15:04.069 --> 15:06.441
He was murdered last night, Captain.

15:06.696 --> 15:07.941
I'm sorry.

15:08.615 --> 15:10.821
You were
Lieutenant Commander Voss' CO

15:10.909 --> 15:12.589
at Norfolk when he was
under investigation?

15:12.619 --> 15:14.861
Yeah, he was
my command supply officer.

15:14.954 --> 15:16.365
And I got to tell you I was shocked

15:16.456 --> 15:19.029
when the credit card fraud
was uncovered and he was suspected.

15:19.125 --> 15:20.869
Nobody else had access to the cards?

15:20.960 --> 15:23.831
Now there's thousands of military
and civilian employees

15:23.922 --> 15:25.464
who had access to those cards.

15:25.548 --> 15:28.882
- That's why he was able to pull it off.
- I don't understand.

15:28.968 --> 15:31.673
In order to cut down
on the cash disbursed,

15:31.763 --> 15:33.672
the DOD issues credit cards.

15:33.765 --> 15:35.389
A phoney company was set up

15:35.475 --> 15:38.678
making small charges against
a vast number of these accounts.

15:38.770 --> 15:41.059
Accounts that Commander Voss
had approved.

15:41.147 --> 15:44.232
- How'd he get caught?
- Well, he didn't for almost four years.

15:44.317 --> 15:48.101
Then he decided to expand his scam to
bilk the entire Atlantic fleet command.

15:48.196 --> 15:50.983
He got over $12 million before
finally somebody noticed anything.

15:51.074 --> 15:53.316
- What happened to the money?
- Nobody knows.

15:53.410 --> 15:56.779
When Commander Voss died all he had
was savings that were reasonable

15:56.871 --> 16:01.035
for a lieutenant commander in the Navy
which is why I'm not certain he did it.

16:01.126 --> 16:03.083
What did Special Agent Pacci ask you?

16:03.169 --> 16:04.877
He didn't ask me anything
about the scam.

16:04.963 --> 16:06.872
All he wanted to know
was who Voss had dated.

16:06.965 --> 16:08.756
And I didn't know.

16:12.178 --> 16:14.135
McGee, it's not like you.
What's taking so long?

16:14.222 --> 16:15.716
I've almost got it.

16:18.393 --> 16:20.705
You know, the quicker you get this done
the more quality time

16:20.729 --> 16:23.165
you'll have to spend with
a certain tattooed forensic technician

16:23.189 --> 16:24.269
of the goth persuasion.

16:24.357 --> 16:26.931
- What do you mean by that?
- Oh, come on.

16:27.819 --> 16:29.562
Abby told me you closed the deal

16:29.654 --> 16:32.940
under some pretty hinky circumstances.

16:33.032 --> 16:34.657
She told you that?

16:34.993 --> 16:39.287
Well, the hinky thing, did she tell you
that that was her idea? Cause...

16:40.790 --> 16:42.783
Abby didn't tell you anything, did she?

16:42.876 --> 16:46.956
A well-trained NCIS special agent
is good at extracting information.

16:47.130 --> 16:49.253
You'll learn. Focus.

16:54.220 --> 16:56.177
- I have her address.
- You do?

16:56.264 --> 16:57.639
- How?
- Look.

16:57.974 --> 17:02.351
Since evidently this is her residence,
I used the process of elimination.

17:02.729 --> 17:05.349
- Quercus Virginiana.
- Excuse me?

17:05.647 --> 17:07.272
It's a variety of oak tree.

17:07.358 --> 17:09.684
Now how can you tell?
It doesn't have any leaves on it.

17:09.778 --> 17:12.732
- Why, I identified the bark.
- Of course, you did.

17:12.821 --> 17:15.608
A search of the registry
from the Arboretum Society

17:15.700 --> 17:19.318
shows that 28 streets were planted
with that genus of tree.

17:19.412 --> 17:21.819
So I narrowed it down even further.

17:22.874 --> 17:27.416
The Department of Public Works says
that that Victorian light, circa 1905,

17:27.503 --> 17:29.496
was installed
on only seven of those streets.

17:29.589 --> 17:31.629
If we'd look even closer...

17:35.136 --> 17:36.880
She's got great legs.

17:37.013 --> 17:39.682
- Yes, she does.
- You narrowed it down to seven streets.

17:39.766 --> 17:42.411
Four of those are eliminated because
they don't have three-digit addresses.

17:42.435 --> 17:43.514
Of the remaining,

17:43.603 --> 17:47.352
only one, according to
the US Postal Service, 40th Street,

17:49.192 --> 17:51.184
has a mailbox in the middle of the block.

17:51.277 --> 17:53.234
Okay. I'll take it from here, McGee.

17:53.321 --> 17:54.881
You look like
you could use some coffee.

17:54.948 --> 17:55.979
Not really.

17:56.074 --> 17:58.612
I take mine with three sugars
and a hazelnut.

18:02.038 --> 18:04.446
- How'd it go?
- Tell me you have her name, DiNozzo.

18:04.541 --> 18:06.450
Any second, boss. I got an address.

18:06.543 --> 18:08.369
I'm running it
through the search engines.

18:08.461 --> 18:11.711
- How'd you find it?
- The process of elimination, actually.

18:13.258 --> 18:16.792
- Here it is. Amanda Reed.
- Background her, Kate.

18:16.886 --> 18:19.175
Deep as you can go. Come on, Tony.

18:19.722 --> 18:24.100
- McGee, good work on the address.
- Oh, thank you, boss.

18:41.077 --> 18:44.363
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, okay. Thanks for that.

18:44.455 --> 18:46.744
Well, Kate can't find
any criminal record.

18:46.833 --> 18:50.368
In fact, Amanda Reed
sounds like a upstanding citizen.

18:50.461 --> 18:53.996
Single, real clean TRW,
she just bought this townhouse,

18:54.090 --> 18:55.917
paid cash, no mortgage.

18:56.009 --> 18:57.503
She recently was accepted

18:57.594 --> 18:59.586
to the Potomac Country Club
as a member.

18:59.679 --> 19:00.758
I'm impressed.

19:00.847 --> 19:02.555
- You want me to do the interview?
- No.

19:02.640 --> 19:04.348
I can work her, boss.

19:05.101 --> 19:07.010
Chris was keeping his distance
for a reason.

19:07.103 --> 19:10.437
- Until we find out why, we do the same.
- Why?

19:13.234 --> 19:15.856
This photograph was taken
from up there.

19:18.615 --> 19:20.607
Excuse me. You the building manager?

19:20.700 --> 19:23.535
No. I got a thing
for sweeping sidewalks.

19:24.287 --> 19:26.694
Is your apartment still up for rent?

19:28.541 --> 19:30.783
You guys together?

19:33.421 --> 19:35.746
No, it's not what you're thinking.

19:37.342 --> 19:38.421
NCIS.

19:38.509 --> 19:41.510
Oh, guy the other day
showed me a badge just like that.

19:41.596 --> 19:42.675
Did he rent it?

19:42.764 --> 19:45.005
Nah, he just took some pictures inside

19:45.099 --> 19:46.642
and said he'd get back to me.

19:46.726 --> 19:48.517
We'd like to see the apartment.

19:48.603 --> 19:51.438
- To take pictures or to rent it?
- To rent it.

19:51.731 --> 19:53.356
Oh. All right.

19:56.361 --> 19:59.112
We're gonna pick up
where Chris left off.

20:00.073 --> 20:02.314
- Stakeout time.
- Yeah!

20:06.696 --> 20:09.187
Haven't been on a stakeout
for a long time.

20:09.282 --> 20:12.117
- I'm looking forward to this.
- Figures. You're a voyeur.

20:12.201 --> 20:15.072
- You like spying on people.
- And this is legal.

20:15.163 --> 20:18.911
Would you be as excited
if the mark was a 300-pound bald guy?

20:19.000 --> 20:20.992
- Nope.
- What'd you find out?

20:21.085 --> 20:23.291
No vehicle registered
in Amanda Reed's name.

20:23.379 --> 20:25.419
She doesn't even have
a driver's licence.

20:25.506 --> 20:27.415
But a lot of people
don't have cars in the city.

20:27.508 --> 20:28.587
DiNozzo?

20:28.676 --> 20:32.377
A connect between the dead
Commander Voss and Amanda Reed.

20:32.471 --> 20:35.805
I ran a title search
on the townhouse she just bought.

20:35.892 --> 20:38.264
It's too much to be a coincidence.

20:38.769 --> 20:39.932
Are you gonna spit it out

20:40.021 --> 20:41.661
or I have to waste my coffee
on your head?

20:41.731 --> 20:43.973
The house was in the Voss family
for three generations.

20:44.066 --> 20:46.818
Commander's father lost it
in a bankruptcy in '79.

20:46.903 --> 20:50.022
Got a call into the real estate agent
who sold it to Amanda Reed.

20:50.114 --> 20:52.843
- Waiting to hear back from her.
- Kate and I'll take the first shift.

20:52.867 --> 20:55.868
- You and McGee relieve us at 19:00.
- Yeah.

20:56.412 --> 20:57.527
Problemo?

20:57.622 --> 20:59.828
Well, you really want to
do that to McGee?

20:59.916 --> 21:02.407
Special Agent Bligh here
is gonna eat him alive.

21:02.501 --> 21:04.790
McGee looks up to me as a mentor.

21:05.171 --> 21:08.622
You want to be stuck
in a cramped apartment with DiNozzo?

21:08.966 --> 21:10.377
Be my guest.

21:10.468 --> 21:12.793
On the other hand,
it'll help McGee build character.

21:12.887 --> 21:15.674
All set, boss.
The secured phone line is installed

21:15.765 --> 21:17.743
and the surveillance equipment
is loaded in the van.

21:17.767 --> 21:18.846
Good.

21:18.935 --> 21:20.537
Special Agent Pacci
filled out a requisition

21:20.561 --> 21:23.515
for a lot of the same equipment,
but never picked it up.

21:23.606 --> 21:27.473
Yeah. Yeah, I know. Let's go, Kate.

21:28.861 --> 21:31.020
You ever been on
a stakeout before, McGee?

21:31.113 --> 21:33.651
No. But I'm looking forward
to the experience.

21:33.741 --> 21:35.283
Behave yourself.

21:56.222 --> 21:58.096
Hey, Abs. You there?

21:58.182 --> 22:01.017
Yeah, Gibbs.
I finally got the link working.

22:01.102 --> 22:03.178
- Our lady's back.
- Yeah, I saw her.

22:03.271 --> 22:06.225
I finished pulling
the last two weeks off Pacci's computer.

22:06.315 --> 22:08.985
There wasn't a lot there.
Like a lot of older agents.

22:09.068 --> 22:10.646
He wasn't very computer savvy.

22:10.736 --> 22:11.816
Send me the files.

22:11.904 --> 22:14.063
Well, you know how to download them?

22:14.156 --> 22:16.398
- Don't go there, Abs.
- Touchy.

22:16.575 --> 22:19.149
Can we do a sound check
on the laser mike?

22:19.245 --> 22:20.573
Sure.

22:26.252 --> 22:29.668
- Where'd she go?
- Starbucks. Seems to be a regular.

22:29.755 --> 22:32.626
Non-fat grande foamy latte.

22:32.717 --> 22:35.587
Then to a pharmacy
to pick up a prescription.

22:36.846 --> 22:38.673
I think she's running water.

22:38.764 --> 22:41.469
Oh, yeah. Hear it loud and clear.

22:41.642 --> 22:44.762
Oh, the lady's got expensive taste.

22:44.854 --> 22:47.808
Purse is Prada.
It'd cost me a month's pay.

22:54.280 --> 22:57.483
I've had quick sales before,
but nothing like this.

22:57.658 --> 23:01.442
She wrote a cheque for the full
asking price. No contingencies.

23:01.537 --> 23:03.613
And we closed in 15 days.

23:03.706 --> 23:06.031
And you told all that
to Special Agent Pacci.

23:06.125 --> 23:08.663
Yeah. He first came in
two or three years ago.

23:08.753 --> 23:11.326
Wanted to be notified
if the townhouse was ever listed.

23:11.422 --> 23:13.461
I thought he wanted to buy.

23:14.008 --> 23:15.585
Couldn't afford it,

23:15.676 --> 23:17.362
so you called him when it
went back on the market?

23:17.386 --> 23:20.921
Oh, well, truth is I forgot.
After it sold, I remembered.

23:21.015 --> 23:22.758
I called.
I thought he was gonna be upset,

23:22.850 --> 23:25.934
but when I told him
how Miss Reed had made the buy,

23:26.020 --> 23:27.894
he sounded a little excited.

23:27.980 --> 23:31.764
- And did you get to know her very well?
- No, not really.

23:32.693 --> 23:35.184
I usually get to look
at the client's loan aps

23:35.279 --> 23:37.687
and, you know, tax returns.

23:37.782 --> 23:42.194
But this was such a clean deal
I didn't have to bother with any of that.

23:42.286 --> 23:45.536
- Well, thanks. You've been a big help.
- Sure.

23:45.623 --> 23:48.292
Say, why isn't
Special Agent Pacci here?

23:48.918 --> 23:51.325
I'm filling in for him on the case.

23:51.921 --> 23:54.626
- Thanks, again.
- You want to buy a house?

23:59.470 --> 24:02.720
- Anything?
- No. Abby was right.

24:02.807 --> 24:05.179
Chris didn't leave
much of a computer trail.

24:05.267 --> 24:07.937
He was surfing the website
of the Bangkok Visitor's Bureau,

24:08.020 --> 24:09.847
but I cannot figure out why.

24:11.065 --> 24:12.440
I'll get it.

24:15.736 --> 24:16.934
Miss me?

24:18.280 --> 24:19.905
- What's that?
- Dinner.

24:19.990 --> 24:22.742
Trying to broaden
Special Agent McGee's palette.

24:22.827 --> 24:24.985
- It stinks.
- What'd you two find out?

24:25.079 --> 24:27.451
Well, apparently,
Chris knew that Amanda had a thing

24:27.540 --> 24:29.200
for the Voss family home.

24:29.291 --> 24:33.372
- Been keeping an eye on it.
- What's Amanda Reed's link to Voss?

24:33.462 --> 24:35.669
I researched Amanda Reed's
prior residences.

24:35.756 --> 24:37.998
Her last known address
was Virginia Beach.

24:38.092 --> 24:39.586
Which is eight miles from Norfolk

24:39.677 --> 24:41.753
where Lieutenant Commander Voss
was stationed.

24:41.846 --> 24:44.681
Before that she lived
in Jacksonville, Florida.

24:44.765 --> 24:47.552
While he was at
Mayport Naval Station. 10 miles away.

24:47.643 --> 24:50.478
Prior to that Amanda Reed lived
in La Mesa, California.

24:50.563 --> 24:53.766
Just outside of San Diego
while he pulled duty at Coronado.

24:53.858 --> 24:57.772
- Well, they knew each other.
- Sounds like more than "knew" to me.

24:57.945 --> 24:59.653
Good work, huh, boss?

25:00.531 --> 25:02.524
Tomorrow's garbage day.

25:02.616 --> 25:05.154
I'm sure she'll take her trash out tonight.
Go through it.

25:05.244 --> 25:06.323
Right.

25:06.412 --> 25:09.282
And by the way, Tony, there's only
one bathroom. It's clean now.

25:09.373 --> 25:10.976
I want to find it that way
when I get back.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.949
- What do you think I'm going to do?
- I've seen you fire your weapon.

25:15.045 --> 25:16.837
I don't trust your aim.

25:16.922 --> 25:19.496
I love this.
It's just like the movie Stakeout.

25:19.592 --> 25:21.668
There was a movie, Stakeout?

25:22.011 --> 25:23.838
How old are you? It's a classic.

25:23.929 --> 25:27.512
Richard Dreyfuss
and one of Martin Sheen's kids.

25:27.600 --> 25:30.684
- Emilio Estevez.
- Well, how can Estevez be a Sheen?

25:30.769 --> 25:32.976
Martin Sheen's not a Sheen.

25:33.731 --> 25:36.851
It was cool.
There were two teams, just like us.

25:37.026 --> 25:39.647
Trading shifts,
pulling practical jokes on each other.

25:39.737 --> 25:42.607
I'm warning you, DiNozzo.
Don't even go there.

25:47.953 --> 25:51.369
- We got to go there. Any ideas, McGee?
- No.

25:52.416 --> 25:54.373
Well, don't worry, I got plenty.

25:54.460 --> 25:56.369
You realise that any prank
we pull on Kate,

25:56.462 --> 25:58.668
we'll also be pulling on Gibbs.

25:59.215 --> 26:01.373
- That's a problem.
- Unless...

26:02.801 --> 26:04.461
- Nah.
- What?

26:04.553 --> 26:07.044
Well, I was thinking.

26:07.139 --> 26:11.516
Since she is expecting something,
maybe we should do nothing.

26:15.105 --> 26:16.268
That's brilliant.

26:16.357 --> 26:18.437
It'll drive her nuts
trying to figure out what we did

26:18.484 --> 26:20.144
that we didn't do.

26:22.321 --> 26:25.357
You're all right, McGee.
Have a pastrami.

26:27.493 --> 26:32.155
Jethro, I didn't expect you back this late.
I was just about to call you.

26:32.248 --> 26:34.287
Find something off
in that autopsy report?

26:34.375 --> 26:37.993
No, I didn't.
It was detailed and complete.

26:38.671 --> 26:42.087
As I expected, the ME's transcript
was impeccable.

26:42.174 --> 26:43.918
There was a full complement of photos

26:44.009 --> 26:47.959
and the lab work-ups were everything
that I would have asked for.

26:48.055 --> 26:50.593
- Who identified Voss' body?
- Nobody.

26:50.683 --> 26:52.093
They used a DNA match

26:52.184 --> 26:56.264
as the body was badly burned
in the automobile crash.

26:56.355 --> 26:59.439
Ducky, would Buford County still have
the tissue samples from the case

26:59.525 --> 27:02.063
- in their evidence locker?
- I would assume so.

27:02.152 --> 27:03.563
I'll check. Why?

27:03.654 --> 27:06.655
- Have Abby re-run the DNA.
- Right.

27:08.409 --> 27:10.567
I heard the director

27:10.661 --> 27:12.737
asked you to speak
at Pacci's memorial service.

27:12.830 --> 27:14.538
Yeah. I declined.

27:15.457 --> 27:18.079
- Oh, Gibbs.
- Can't do it, Duck.

27:19.169 --> 27:21.791
Wouldn't feel right. I'll see you there.

27:32.057 --> 27:33.552
Yeah, but I don't understand

27:33.642 --> 27:35.718
why I need approval
from the historical committee.

27:35.811 --> 27:39.476
I just want to paint my front door
and my window trim.

27:39.565 --> 27:41.688
No, no, no. Where'd you go?

27:41.859 --> 27:44.184
- Where'd you go?
- Yeah, all right.

27:44.445 --> 27:48.312
- You know what? I think...
- Don't put on a shirt. It's hot out.

27:49.199 --> 27:50.742
I'm tired of fighting with you guys.

27:50.826 --> 27:52.345
Where do you want me
to send the colour samples?

27:52.369 --> 27:54.029
I think I'm falling in love.

27:54.121 --> 27:56.363
Okay, putting them in the mail today.

28:02.379 --> 28:04.372
Are you finished yet?

28:04.465 --> 28:08.297
Yeah. And all I've learned is
she loves bananas and mangos.

28:08.927 --> 28:12.094
Also uses every beauty product
sold on cable TV.

28:12.431 --> 28:14.589
Maybe she's older than she looks.

28:17.061 --> 28:20.477
- How old do you think she is?
- I don't know. 30s.

28:32.034 --> 28:33.113
Yeah.

28:34.453 --> 28:36.161
I need some fresh air.

28:41.168 --> 28:42.283
Abigail.

28:42.503 --> 28:44.875
Donald. You look very snappy today.

28:44.963 --> 28:47.371
I'm going to Christopher Pacci's
memorial service.

28:47.466 --> 28:48.497
Oh.

28:48.592 --> 28:52.637
I wanted to drop off
these blood and tissue samples first.

28:52.721 --> 28:56.671
- Who's the unlucky donor?
- Victim of a car crash three years ago.

28:56.767 --> 29:01.014
- Lieutenant Commander Voss?
- Gibbs wants you to test the DNA.

29:01.480 --> 29:03.307
Were the original results questionable?

29:03.399 --> 29:08.107
No. They were as positive as it gets
and certified by a reputable lab.

29:08.195 --> 29:10.947
- So Gibbs wants me to retest them.
- He does.

29:11.031 --> 29:14.815
- DNA does not lie, Duckman.
- Yeah, tell that to Gibbs.

29:15.869 --> 29:18.954
That's an unusual
surveillance technique.

29:19.373 --> 29:21.864
Well, DiNozzo is an unusual agent.

29:22.668 --> 29:24.376
McGee, are you watching this?

29:24.461 --> 29:27.131
- Watching what?
- What the hell is DiNozzo up to?

29:27.214 --> 29:28.329
Well, he's not here.

29:28.424 --> 29:31.175
No. He's across the street
talking to the lady.

29:33.887 --> 29:36.010
'Cause I live down on Canal and I just...

29:36.098 --> 29:37.592
I've been trying to paint my door

29:37.683 --> 29:40.174
and the historical society
is giving me nothing but grief.

29:40.269 --> 29:42.427
I know.
I just got off the phone with them.

29:42.521 --> 29:43.719
I just want to paint my door

29:43.814 --> 29:46.601
and my trim and they're making it
virtually impossible on me.

29:46.692 --> 29:47.771
It's total nonsense.

29:47.860 --> 29:50.066
You know, those are my exact words.

29:50.362 --> 29:53.648
- Hi. I'm Amanda.
- Hi. Stringfellow.

29:53.741 --> 29:55.199
You're kidding, right?

29:55.284 --> 29:58.902
Well, five generations
of Stringfellows, you know...

29:58.996 --> 30:01.783
- Stringfellow?
- It's so he won't forget it.

30:02.040 --> 30:03.416
You should.

30:04.209 --> 30:06.083
Look, DiNozzo is your partner.

30:06.170 --> 30:07.712
In the world according to Gibbs,

30:07.796 --> 30:09.670
you share the blame
if anything goes hinky.

30:09.757 --> 30:10.955
Oh, geez.

30:11.759 --> 30:13.881
Okay, what do I do here, Abs?

30:13.969 --> 30:16.590
Don't volunteer anything.
Only answer questions asked.

30:16.680 --> 30:19.349
And whatever you do, do not lie.
Because Gibbs is like Santa Claus.

30:19.433 --> 30:20.975
He knows if you've been naughty.

30:27.441 --> 30:29.647
How was the memorial service?

30:29.943 --> 30:32.232
The director gave a nice eulogy.

30:32.362 --> 30:34.154
- Anything happen?
- Nope. Not a thing, boss.

30:34.239 --> 30:35.899
- Very quiet.
- Very.

30:36.617 --> 30:39.986
Is that why you seem so anxious,
Special Agent McGee?

30:40.954 --> 30:42.034
Me?

30:44.208 --> 30:46.533
- What did you do to him?
- Nothing.

30:47.211 --> 30:49.203
This place looks too clean.

30:53.884 --> 30:57.217
- Excuse me. Hi.
- Where is she now?

30:57.304 --> 30:59.546
In the back of the house. In the kitchen.

30:59.640 --> 31:02.510
- Check her trash?
- Yes, boss. And nothing unusual.

31:02.601 --> 31:04.973
Have it sent to Abby for prints.

31:05.062 --> 31:08.347
I had a great time, too. Oh, I can't.

31:08.649 --> 31:12.860
I can't tonight, Dwayne, but I promise
I'll make it up to you this weekend.

31:13.153 --> 31:14.897
I'll call you back.

31:14.988 --> 31:17.906
- DiNozzo!
- Sounds like Dwayne's in love.

31:18.200 --> 31:20.109
Permission to shoot him?

31:20.202 --> 31:22.278
- Hey, Gibbs. You there?
- Yeah, Abs. What's up?

31:22.371 --> 31:25.905
- You rule.
- I know, but remind me why.

31:25.999 --> 31:28.122
For wanting the DNA retested.

31:28.210 --> 31:29.490
You can't have the results yet.

31:29.586 --> 31:30.701
Oh, no. I didn't run it.

31:30.796 --> 31:32.670
Abby, damn it. I'm not in the mood.

31:32.756 --> 31:34.713
Chill, Gibbs. I didn't have to.

31:34.800 --> 31:37.920
The crispy critter from the crash
is type O-positive.

31:38.011 --> 31:40.633
Lieutenant Commander Voss,
AB-negative.

31:40.722 --> 31:41.885
Voss is alive?

31:41.974 --> 31:45.093
Unless he's an alien
with shifting blood types.

31:45.185 --> 31:47.474
He's alive with all those millions.

31:47.563 --> 31:51.014
Living la dolce vita. Lucky bastard.

31:53.902 --> 31:55.361
Not for long.

32:02.611 --> 32:04.899
Geo-tech Lab is your next right.

32:06.531 --> 32:09.366
I just thought you might, I don't know...

32:12.788 --> 32:13.902
Miss it.

32:13.997 --> 32:17.413
What I'm missing is talking to that tech
who DNA-certified that body

32:17.501 --> 32:18.644
was Lieutenant Commander Voss.

32:18.668 --> 32:19.913
Well, he's not listed.

32:20.003 --> 32:21.794
So maybe he no longer works
at Geo-tech.

32:21.880 --> 32:23.339
Call them and ask.

32:25.342 --> 32:26.753
Joshua Lurie please.

32:26.843 --> 32:29.334
- Think they made a clerical error?
- Nope.

32:29.429 --> 32:31.754
- People make mistakes, Gibbs.
- Like back-seat driving?

32:31.848 --> 32:34.933
I'm in the front seat. Yes. Joshua Lurie.

32:36.937 --> 32:38.016
When?

32:40.857 --> 32:42.186
He's dead.

32:43.026 --> 32:45.149
Two years ago in a car crash.

32:47.447 --> 32:49.819
Where'd you come up
with a name like Stringfellow?

32:49.908 --> 32:52.031
- Airwolf.
- Never heard of it.

32:53.078 --> 32:55.236
You never watched Stakeout,
never heard of Airwolf?

32:55.330 --> 32:58.497
What do you do on the weekends?
And don't say party.

32:59.501 --> 33:01.043
Why, I write.

33:01.586 --> 33:05.370
- Write?
- Yeah, try to write, mysteries.

33:06.591 --> 33:09.261
- That's funny.
- I never should have told you.

33:09.344 --> 33:13.093
No. No, no. It's good.
That's good stuff. We're bonding.

33:13.807 --> 33:16.214
Hey, where do you get your ideas?

33:17.102 --> 33:20.138
Well, cases like this one.

33:20.272 --> 33:23.308
Guy steals millions of dollars,
makes it look like he's dead,

33:23.400 --> 33:26.105
has his girlfriend
buy the old family home.

33:26.486 --> 33:28.313
Isn't that plagiarism?

33:28.405 --> 33:29.982
I don't think so.

33:35.662 --> 33:37.951
I'd love to see the return address.

33:43.295 --> 33:44.775
I'm gonna get a look at that package.

33:44.838 --> 33:47.755
No, no, Tony.
I don't think that's a good idea. Tony!

34:01.313 --> 34:02.807
Anti-ageing cream.

34:06.860 --> 34:09.315
Tony, get out of there. Get out of there.

34:10.780 --> 34:11.860
Hey.

34:12.991 --> 34:14.449
Stringfellow.

34:15.994 --> 34:17.821
You remember my name.

34:17.996 --> 34:19.455
How could I forget it?

34:19.539 --> 34:21.331
What are you doing here?

34:22.583 --> 34:26.331
Well, I could say
that I'm your new mailman.

34:27.589 --> 34:29.545
Which I wouldn't believe.

34:33.261 --> 34:36.926
All right. Then, how about,
I just wanted to see you again?

34:51.696 --> 34:53.321
You like espresso?

34:54.824 --> 34:56.532
Yeah. I love espresso.

34:58.036 --> 34:59.281
Come on in.

35:02.290 --> 35:04.283
Tony, don't do it. Come on.

35:07.754 --> 35:11.253
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
Hamilton Voss and Josh Lurie

35:11.341 --> 35:13.713
graduated from the same high school
in the same year.

35:13.802 --> 35:17.135
That clinches it. Voss is alive.
He faked his own death

35:17.222 --> 35:20.887
in an accident where his old schoolmate
could make the DNA ID.

35:20.976 --> 35:23.431
- For which Voss killed him?
- Yeah. Why not?

35:23.520 --> 35:26.723
Voss killed whoever really burned
in that car crash,

35:26.815 --> 35:30.148
murdered Chris when he found out
he was tailing him in his...

35:31.111 --> 35:34.028
He caught Chris tailing him.
Maybe he's on to us.

35:35.073 --> 35:37.066
Anyway, we made it into the Final Four.

35:37.158 --> 35:39.946
I was playing for Ohio State.
We got beat by UCLA.

35:43.957 --> 35:46.495
- Special Agent McGee.
- Put DiNozzo on.

35:48.378 --> 35:50.620
He can't come to the phone
right now, boss.

35:50.714 --> 35:52.623
Where is he, in the head?

35:53.758 --> 35:56.545
He's across the street
in the townhouse with her.

35:56.636 --> 35:58.843
Well, what the hell
is he doing there, McGee?

35:58.930 --> 36:00.970
I really couldn't explain.

36:01.057 --> 36:03.299
Have Abby patch the video feed
from the stakeout up here.

36:03.393 --> 36:05.635
McGee, you listen to me.

36:05.937 --> 36:10.314
Voss is out there somewhere
watching us watch Amanda.

36:21.828 --> 36:22.943
You like Paddy's?

36:23.038 --> 36:24.781
Hamburger or turkey?

36:25.123 --> 36:27.696
No. Paddy's Pub around the corner.

36:27.792 --> 36:29.168
- Oh.
- Yeah.

36:29.252 --> 36:31.458
I thought you were offering me
something to eat.

36:31.546 --> 36:33.040
I am offering you something to eat.

36:33.131 --> 36:34.506
Corned beef and beer, huh?

36:34.591 --> 36:36.133
I'd love corned beef and beer.

36:36.217 --> 36:39.171
Great. Let me go change
into something else, Stringfellow.

36:39.262 --> 36:40.507
Okay.

36:40.597 --> 36:41.972
Stringfellow?

36:42.057 --> 36:43.930
I'm gonna wait outside.

36:49.856 --> 36:52.014
Did you get that? Paddy's Pub?

36:52.901 --> 36:54.181
Gibbs?

36:55.862 --> 36:58.020
- He's been watching me?
- Yeah.

37:00.367 --> 37:02.110
- Hey, boss.
- DiNozzo,

37:02.786 --> 37:04.695
what the hell are you doing?

37:04.788 --> 37:08.121
I had an opening.
It was a clear field. I had to go for it.

37:08.208 --> 37:10.117
- Good.
- Good?

37:10.543 --> 37:13.497
Yeah. Good, Tony. You're the bait.

37:13.588 --> 37:17.752
Okay, Voss is out there somewhere
watching you like he watched Chris.

37:18.218 --> 37:19.760
Like he watched Chris.

37:19.844 --> 37:20.924
Enjoy your date.

37:21.012 --> 37:23.966
And stay out of elevators. Let's go.

37:26.059 --> 37:28.431
- Okay. Cover my back.
- You got it.

37:28.561 --> 37:29.641
Tony?

37:30.522 --> 37:32.514
Now, how do I take the safety off?

37:32.607 --> 37:34.600
- You take...
- Just kidding.

37:39.239 --> 37:40.567
In a rush, Abby?

37:40.657 --> 37:43.444
I ran the prints
from Amanda Reed's garbage.

37:44.160 --> 37:46.865
What the hell is wrong with you two?

37:46.955 --> 37:49.035
Tony made contact
with Amanda, they're going to a pub

37:49.124 --> 37:50.885
and Commander Voss
is probably stalking Tony.

37:50.917 --> 37:53.123
- Really?
- It's not funny.

37:53.211 --> 37:54.539
He probably killed Pacci.

37:54.629 --> 37:56.669
- Amanda murdered Pacci.
- Amanda?

37:56.756 --> 37:59.330
Okay, I take it back.
Commander Voss did it.

37:59.426 --> 38:00.540
Abby.

38:00.635 --> 38:02.924
She's my daughter,
my sister, my daughter,

38:03.012 --> 38:04.804
my sister, my daughter.

38:07.642 --> 38:10.394
Every print that I pulled off
all those cosmetic jars you gave me

38:10.478 --> 38:12.138
come from one person.

38:12.230 --> 38:14.306
- Amanda Reed.
- Yes and no.

38:14.691 --> 38:15.805
Abby.

38:15.900 --> 38:18.652
They belong
to Lieutenant Commander Voss.

38:18.736 --> 38:20.646
Amanda is Voss.

38:21.698 --> 38:22.943
She's a he?

38:23.032 --> 38:25.191
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

38:26.661 --> 38:29.234
- Tony's on a date with a guy.
- Yeah.

38:32.041 --> 38:33.666
Oh, Stringfellow.

38:34.711 --> 38:37.118
You know, you have beautiful eyes.

38:39.174 --> 38:40.668
Call me String.

38:40.758 --> 38:42.798
You got a great smile, too.

38:52.437 --> 38:53.931
It's my boss.

38:54.439 --> 38:57.274
Well, work hours are over.

38:57.901 --> 38:59.099
It's time to play.

38:59.194 --> 39:01.482
Yeah, but I got to take this
'cause I can't not

39:01.571 --> 39:03.564
take a call from my boss.

39:05.200 --> 39:06.314
It's...

39:07.243 --> 39:09.699
I could always call him back later.

39:17.337 --> 39:19.329
Excuse me. Cola, please?

39:22.258 --> 39:24.749
- He's not answering.
- Maybe he can't.

39:27.263 --> 39:28.639
Here you go.

39:30.850 --> 39:33.887
I'm going to go wash my hands
before we eat.

39:37.190 --> 39:38.933
- Be right back.
- Okay.

39:39.025 --> 39:40.733
- Don't leave.
- Okay.

39:53.331 --> 39:55.620
Why didn't you answer the phone?

39:56.209 --> 39:57.454
Couldn't.

39:57.752 --> 39:59.709
- Where's Amanda?
- Ladies' room.

39:59.796 --> 40:03.247
Swell. We can add that
misdemeanour to the murder charges.

40:03.341 --> 40:04.420
What?

40:04.509 --> 40:07.379
Amanda is
Lieutenant Commander Voss, DiNozzo.

40:11.182 --> 40:12.297
Stop it. Come on.

40:12.392 --> 40:14.218
She's a he, bonehead.

40:14.811 --> 40:19.389
And if he is packing a.357
and a knife in his purse he killed Chris.

40:29.158 --> 40:32.112
Well, I am famished.

40:35.790 --> 40:38.910
- Aren't you hungry?
- Lost my appetite.

40:39.627 --> 40:42.118
Oh, what's wrong?

40:43.381 --> 40:45.504
I don't know where to begin.

40:46.551 --> 40:49.754
Is this the same man I left sitting here
a few minutes ago?

40:49.846 --> 40:52.135
I don't know. You the same woman?

40:52.432 --> 40:55.551
Oh, yes. I...

41:00.356 --> 41:01.934
Open your purse.

41:10.241 --> 41:11.985
Federal agent! Move!

41:19.834 --> 41:22.918
- Stop him. Stop him.
- No, stop her.

41:36.643 --> 41:37.923
His name

41:38.686 --> 41:41.260
was Special Agent Chris Pacci.

41:45.485 --> 41:47.193
And he was a friend.

42:00.583 --> 42:03.667
Federal agents.
So are those two. Let them go.

42:03.753 --> 42:05.081
Let me go.

42:10.093 --> 42:11.966
He didn't have a chance.

42:12.053 --> 42:13.464
Why'd he try?

42:40.331 --> 42:43.665
Why are you going through everything
before you box it?

42:45.712 --> 42:47.289
Force of habit.

42:47.630 --> 42:51.081
I don't want his family
getting an unpleasant surprise.

42:53.344 --> 42:56.345
- Reminds me of The Crying Game.
- Don't know it.

42:57.181 --> 42:59.008
It was such a cool flick.

42:59.100 --> 43:02.101
Abby, could you pick
some other movie please?

43:02.186 --> 43:05.021
Oh, Victor/Victoria.

43:05.273 --> 43:07.753
That was a girl pretending to be a guy
pretending to be a girl?

43:07.817 --> 43:09.856
- Right.
- Yeah, that one's okay.

43:10.027 --> 43:12.020
Got to hand it to Commander Voss.

43:12.113 --> 43:14.651
For three years,
he hid in plain sight as a woman.

43:14.741 --> 43:16.365
Well, he wasn't a woman yet.

43:16.451 --> 43:19.321
The surgery was scheduled
for next month in Bangkok.

43:19.412 --> 43:22.164
Getting your plumbing turned outside-in.

43:22.623 --> 43:24.581
- It's so...
- Hinky?

43:24.667 --> 43:29.543
- No, no. Way beyond hinky. It's...
- Speaking of way beyond hinky, Tony...

43:29.630 --> 43:33.165
Okay. All right.
Give it to me, Kate. I can take it.

43:38.681 --> 43:41.468
What was it like tonguing a guy?

43:47.815 --> 43:49.855
Forget it. I can't take it.
