00:26.359 --> 00:31.531
Americans understand what war costs.

00:33.742 --> 00:37.037
The American people did not choose this fight.

00:37.328 --> 00:41.249
It came to our shores.

00:41.875 --> 00:46.629
Today, justice has been served.

00:51.676 --> 00:59.559
The world has never seen such a tyranny throughout history.

01:00.727 --> 01:05.815
The battle for America's crusade for freedom.

01:07.233 --> 01:12.614
Nothing has caused more chaos, more galenskap-

01:12.697 --> 01:17.911
- More terror, than the struggle for freedom.

01:19.662 --> 01:27.128
Never has such atrocities committed in the name of God-given freedom.

01:28.713 --> 01:33.551
America has unleashed upon all nations -

01:33.635 --> 01:37.722
-This freedom pest

01:37.806 --> 01:43.269
- The weapons of mass destruction.

01:44.854 --> 01:50.527
America has allowed millions of people have been killed -

01:51.361 --> 01:57.325
- All to justify the spread of democracy.

01:58.201 --> 02:05.000
You murdered in cold blood, the world's only hope of salvation.

02:06.668 --> 02:10.505
For the salvation was fear.

02:10.797 --> 02:15.719
And fear is the one true God -

02:15.802 --> 02:21.725
- All people eventually have to worship.

02:31.234 --> 02:35.905
Now you face the depths of your arrogance.

03:41.304 --> 03:44.933
Can I sit here?

03:45.016 --> 03:47.602
It's a free country.

03:51.523 --> 03:53.650
My name is Amanda.

04:08.164 --> 04:12.627
-Mumford & Sons.
- Never heard of. Next.

04:12.711 --> 04:16.380
-The Beatles.
-She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:16.505 --> 04:19.091
-The Four Seasons.
-The Four Seasons?

04:19.134 --> 04:21.636
Du gillar The Four Seasons?
Frankie Valli?

04:21.761 --> 04:26.599
We are proud that you have chosen to discover Pittsburgh's history -

04:26.683 --> 04:28.518
-via Snyder Building.

04:28.601 --> 04:34.482
It was here that the true American spirit revitalized Pittsburgh.

04:41.614 --> 04:44.868
My name is Ryan. Ryan Taylor. -I know.

04:46.077 --> 04:50.331
Was just joking. But I've seen you on this bus before.

04:50.373 --> 04:53.084
I've seen you too. -Have you?

04:55.086 --> 04:58.882
... American industrialism and free enterprise.

04:58.965 --> 05:03.720
All participants in the day's tour together in ...

05:04.721 --> 05:11.353
Do not forget that we also have our own parking garage.

05:12.103 --> 05:16.858
-Jobbar The KDTA, the TV channel? -What?

05:18.693 --> 05:23.865
You had such a badge one day. A necklace with your picture.

05:23.948 --> 05:27.327
No. It belonged to a friend. I kept it for her.

05:27.452 --> 05:30.705
I practice in the hospital.

05:31.081 --> 05:35.460
We are pleased to share with you one of Pittsburgh's landmarks -

05:35.543 --> 05:40.757
- Not to mention one of the most iconic buildings on the east coast.

05:49.140 --> 05:53.812
Here is my stop and I go never more with this bus-

05:53.895 --> 05:59.275
-for my internship is over. So let me give you ... this.

06:04.864 --> 06:08.159
Is that a real number?

06:29.431 --> 06:31.307
We got him.

06:56.833 --> 06:59.085
Made in America.

07:31.242 --> 07:35.914
We have dramatic pictures from an accident that happened a few minutes ago.

07:35.997 --> 07:38.667
Ni ser Snyder Building
i centrala Pittsburgh-

07:38.792 --> 07:43.171
- Where there a few minutes ago, there was an explosion on the maintenance floor.

07:43.254 --> 07:49.719
Reports say that the blast was powerful enough to reach street level.

07:49.803 --> 07:54.891
A large hole is visible on the building's south side where the first explosion occurred.

07:59.354 --> 08:00.855
Bannings, tack.

08:00.939 --> 08:07.487
As you can see emotions run high when people try to understand the terrible event.

08:07.779 --> 08:10.407
We call for civility and peace.

08:10.490 --> 08:15.620
Bannings, I think we're lucky. The guy knows enough not to bomb template.

08:15.704 --> 08:17.205
He tries to call it.

08:17.288 --> 08:21.835
We receive reports, and do our best to sort the information.

08:21.918 --> 08:24.254
I track right now.

08:28.425 --> 08:32.886
The suspects are offline, but the signal is still strong.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.770
Pittsburgh.

08:44.816 --> 08:49.320
319 North Diamond.
Ryan H. Taylor.

08:55.618 --> 09:00.248
We have confirmation. The house and the cell phone is registered on the guy who rents.

09:00.331 --> 09:04.294
We have triple confirmation. He must be taken alive.

09:04.377 --> 09:08.923
...what happened. We should avoid jumping to conclusions -

09:11.968 --> 09:17.223
- If the explosion. I've heard theories about the gas leak, some kind of chemical fire -

09:17.307 --> 09:20.310
- That there is a possible terrorist attack.

09:24.356 --> 09:28.443
Firefighters trying to enter in the burning rubble in Snyder Building.

09:28.526 --> 09:33.239
Just a few minutes ago, the heroic firefighters in southern entrance.

09:33.323 --> 09:37.577
They went into a smoldering mouth. Minutes later collapsed entrance.

09:37.702 --> 09:41.081
We do not know the location of firefighters ...

09:42.665 --> 09:48.963
Again, at 17.30 FBI decided that this was a ...

09:55.553 --> 09:56.930
Down!

09:56.971 --> 09:59.808
I am an American citizen ...

10:27.544 --> 10:29.713
What am I doing here?

10:29.838 --> 10:34.217
This is well you? Ryan Taylor?

10:34.843 --> 10:39.597
Trained at Quantico? The Department of Special Operations.

10:39.931 --> 10:41.766
Is it true?

10:43.226 --> 10:45.103
And.

10:46.062 --> 10:48.815
Then I just need your signature.

10:48.898 --> 10:51.109
Confidentiality agreement

10:51.693 --> 10:53.236
Terroristaktivitet

10:53.319 --> 10:56.239
The person waives all rights

10:56.322 --> 10:59.242
What the hell is this? -A deal.

11:00.243 --> 11:03.413
-To Not take your case to trial. -Which Trial?

11:03.496 --> 11:10.962
In exchange, you get much lower sentence to be served in closed psychiatric care.

11:12.213 --> 11:15.508
Sorry, who are you?

11:18.386 --> 11:20.096
Ron Carter.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.266
FBI-agent.

11:24.934 --> 11:31.608
I'm investigating the bombing of Snyder Building. You are my prime suspect.

11:39.157 --> 11:42.118
You have the wrong guy.

11:48.458 --> 11:51.961
This is well your mobile?

11:53.630 --> 11:54.756
And.

11:55.924 --> 12:00.261
You called the bomb three times from this phone.

12:00.345 --> 12:04.599
The telephone company and the SIM card confirms it.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.560
And that's just your fingerprints on it.

12:07.644 --> 12:12.607
Ryan ... you killed 76 people.

12:18.446 --> 12:23.868
The girl. A girl on the bus. She gave me her phone number.

12:24.494 --> 12:28.456
Is it someone you work with? -No. She contacted me.

12:28.540 --> 12:32.919
She works on the TV channel KDTA. I saw her badge.

12:33.003 --> 12:36.756
I just need to ... -Listen. Her name is Amanda.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.467
Working on KDTA. 1.75 long.

12:44.848 --> 12:49.936
If it were up to me I would bring you to America generally now-

12:50.020 --> 12:53.565
-so that they could lynch you at Ground Zero.

12:55.775 --> 13:00.155
God knows they need it. But I'm just a messenger.

13:01.031 --> 13:04.701
Your friends wanted it where signed for six hours ago.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.077
CIA.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.708
Do you believe him?

13:13.084 --> 13:14.544
No.

13:17.422 --> 13:22.052
What do the CIA with him? That's between them.

13:22.552 --> 13:29.684
And the girl he mentioned, she from KDTA? I'm just the messenger.

13:30.894 --> 13:34.647
The agent says: "No person in the building."

13:34.731 --> 13:38.568
... An act of terrorism. The building is still burning.

13:41.863 --> 13:46.451
-No. He has not signed yet. -The Clock is almost 05:00 here.

13:46.534 --> 13:50.705
I told you he's talking about this girl.

13:50.789 --> 13:54.709
-Undanflykter. He is trained in it. What do you want me to do?

13:54.793 --> 13:58.421
Anything. They want to be sure that he enters.

13:58.505 --> 14:05.762
Is not it strange that he blows the house in Pittsburgh and the CIA protects him?

14:05.845 --> 14:09.099
I think they are trying to protect themselves.

14:09.182 --> 14:13.645
- Protect him from what?
- Media. Make sure he signs on.

14:14.562 --> 14:17.315
Sir! Come here and look!

14:18.358 --> 14:26.366
Never has such atrocities committed in the name of God given freedom.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.201
I will return.

14:28.284 --> 14:34.833
I say to you today, my friends, let freedom win.

14:36.668 --> 14:41.006
They got it here 15 minutes ago, via email.

14:41.673 --> 14:44.759
Track it! I want to know where it comes from.

14:46.803 --> 14:51.099
The email's IP address coming from Madrid.

14:54.269 --> 14:55.687
Bangalore.

14:55.770 --> 14:59.232
And Tokyo. It is a mirror server.

14:59.858 --> 15:05.780
We can join hands. Thank you, Almighty God.

15:05.864 --> 15:08.575
We are free at last.

15:08.992 --> 15:10.618
Do you see this?

15:15.999 --> 15:20.503
To defeat democracy oppression.

15:22.255 --> 15:27.552
It is time for you to be brought -

15:28.053 --> 15:31.306
- Out of your American dream.

15:33.224 --> 15:38.438
Bombing Snyder Building was just the beginning of our plan.

15:38.521 --> 15:42.734
But today takes your true liberation.

15:43.526 --> 15:50.283
Right now formed an event that will put an end to Western democracy.

15:52.702 --> 15:57.457
We have no demands, no requests for ransom.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.376
Just this:

15:59.459 --> 16:06.800
Fall on your knees, America and submit to the rising fear.

16:07.092 --> 16:11.554
Okay, change of direction. Find the next attack.

16:11.638 --> 16:16.726
I've never seen the guy before! Where will the next attack be?

16:20.021 --> 16:22.273
I do not know.

16:25.110 --> 16:30.323
I do not know what you want me to say. I do not know who the guy is.

16:31.366 --> 16:38.915
This is a trap. Someone is trying to frame me, and thus you too.

16:41.459 --> 16:44.629
Do you hear that? You have the wrong guy!

16:48.091 --> 16:51.302
What do you do? Listen! Hello!

16:51.428 --> 16:56.099
Someone has put a lot of work to put me in this situation.

16:56.182 --> 17:03.106
You chase ghosts, my friend. Let me make a call.

17:12.949 --> 17:17.119
You should talk about where the next attack will take place.

17:18.413 --> 17:23.417
Let me call someone. Let me call someone! No!

17:33.511 --> 17:36.014
Where? What?

17:36.556 --> 17:41.311
Denver? Chicago? L.A.?

17:42.979 --> 17:45.690
I'm American!

17:46.399 --> 17:49.110
I'm American!

17:54.491 --> 17:57.786
Tell me where it will happen, it's over.

17:57.869 --> 18:03.249
You have no idea what you're getting into.

18:07.754 --> 18:13.093
L.A.! Det är i L.A.
I city. Colosseum.

18:14.678 --> 18:17.389
Where will the next attack occur.

19:16.489 --> 19:19.075
Sorry, buddy.

20:00.533 --> 20:03.912
Move your asses! He has escaped!

20:05.830 --> 20:08.166
He has my jacket.

21:42.886 --> 21:48.099
While a new day dawns in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the rescuers -

21:51.644 --> 21:55.273
- Rescue workers are in the city -

21:55.357 --> 22:02.781
- The era of American industrialism, Snyder Building, is now a hub of ...

22:08.036 --> 22:13.375
Okay. 24 km out. 376 and 579. Turn them off.

22:13.458 --> 22:18.296
-404? -Centre. Start here and work you out.

22:18.380 --> 22:23.968
Some residents say that police and FBI presence in Pittsburgh in the morning -

22:24.094 --> 22:26.554
- Adjacent to oppressive.

22:27.681 --> 22:31.476
You have 32-kilometer radius, you have FEMA, you have the National Guard.

22:32.102 --> 22:36.690
Why risk a return to the center? He's looking for someone.

22:47.575 --> 22:53.540
Hi. Special Agent Ron Carter. May I speak with the personnel manager?

22:53.623 --> 23:00.714
Do you think anyone here was involved? -No. We just want to check up all.

23:00.797 --> 23:06.469
Okay. The department's entire staff is listed here. Schedule, everything.

23:14.269 --> 23:15.979
No Matching

23:53.600 --> 23:57.520
-Nyhetsredaktionen.
- I am looking Oskana Rowan.

23:57.604 --> 23:59.481
I'll find her.

23:59.564 --> 24:04.027
... Has escaped the authorities after a chase through the Mount Washington area.

24:04.152 --> 24:10.450
The man the authorities are seeking 26 - year-old Ryan Taylor from Foxton, Pennsylvania.

24:10.533 --> 24:16.206
Several sources confirm that it was he who detonated yesterday's bomb.

24:16.289 --> 24:21.002
It is not clear to Taylor's links to the terrorist group Al Fahad.

24:21.086 --> 24:24.381
Military authorities are investigating ...

24:24.464 --> 24:30.553
- She's not here. I think she's ill.
- It's good. Do you know where she is?

24:30.637 --> 24:33.848
You can probably try her home.

24:40.021 --> 24:46.945
... Has a long history of violence and should be considered armed and dangerous.

24:47.028 --> 24:48.279
What is it?

24:48.363 --> 24:52.450
The authorities confirmed that the man has military background ...

24:52.534 --> 24:56.454
-Carter, What do you do? -Enda Way to be ahead of him.

24:56.538 --> 25:01.084
Do you know what the CIA is capable of? -Not Give us information.

25:01.167 --> 25:06.965
No. We can give you information. Will this get bigger brunt.

25:07.048 --> 25:10.760
Banning, who is this guy?

25:11.094 --> 25:15.515
Find him before the president gets there. Point.

25:17.183 --> 25:21.229
Gateway at the Plaza 441, Building 2. What is there?

25:21.354 --> 25:22.939
What do you think?

25:51.593 --> 25:55.764
The building was closed as soon as we saw the news, he must remain here.

25:56.222 --> 26:01.603
What he wanted down here? He said something about the personnel files.

26:03.396 --> 26:07.192
Thanks for the jacket ... - R

26:21.915 --> 26:26.753
It is here. The server movie came from. An apartment here in Pittsburgh.

26:26.836 --> 26:31.299
-Squirrel Hill? -Good guess. 114 Beechwood Blvd.

26:33.343 --> 26:37.430
We arrange someone to beat up the door for us.

27:11.631 --> 27:14.092
Join in on the hard drive!

27:57.552 --> 28:01.431
Yes thank you. Get me to the police.

28:12.150 --> 28:14.861
Now we have him.

28:16.905 --> 28:18.156
Do not touch anything.

28:22.660 --> 28:24.287
And!

28:24.704 --> 28:30.293
-Herrn. My name is Ryan Taylor. You were with and blew up the building.

28:33.880 --> 28:38.802
Oskana Rowan. You rented an apartment to this girl.

28:38.885 --> 28:42.597
She gave me the number who detonated the bomb.

28:42.681 --> 28:48.853
I need information about her if I should find those who did this.

28:56.277 --> 29:03.243
You know it as well as I do. The Marines do not create traitor.

29:11.876 --> 29:15.505
You have to prove it.

29:22.929 --> 29:28.685
How can my documents to help you? I can trace the money.

29:29.227 --> 29:34.274
It will be difficult, it's just cash. I need bank statements.

29:34.357 --> 29:39.362
No bank statements. Cash only. As a landlord wants it.

29:41.322 --> 29:45.368
... Again, must be considered armed and dangerous.

29:45.452 --> 29:50.206
We got the information of FBI investigators in charge of the case.

29:52.250 --> 29:57.213
I just heard it. American has escaped.

30:04.804 --> 30:10.643
Then we hope that Mr. Taylor is still good at running.

30:16.066 --> 30:19.527
Why not go to the police? They might believe you.

30:19.611 --> 30:24.032
This information only shows that the girl is an accomplice.

30:24.115 --> 30:28.119
I need the man with the mask.

30:32.082 --> 30:34.167
The man on the television.

30:37.754 --> 30:41.216
Second National Banking and Trust. Can I help you?

30:41.299 --> 30:48.098
Yes, I speak with an Art Boyd? I think he's out there. I'll check.

30:49.307 --> 30:53.603
That name sounds familiar. That...

30:54.020 --> 30:58.900
- I'm sorry, he just went home.
He may have been cosignatory.

30:59.484 --> 31:02.654
- I think he leaves town.
-Thanks.

31:06.032 --> 31:08.702
-Here it is. Do you think it is real?

31:08.785 --> 31:11.996
Sure, I'll check everyone.

31:12.497 --> 31:17.127
He's a popular guy. He is cosignatory on all contracts.

31:17.210 --> 31:21.673
And all came to me this time last summer.

31:23.383 --> 31:26.428
-Who is it? The police. Open.

31:26.511 --> 31:29.889
They have traced the girl's address to you.

31:33.059 --> 31:35.729
Sir! It's the police!

31:38.106 --> 31:43.611
By the way, do not let the door hit you in the ass.

31:50.243 --> 31:51.786
I've got it!

31:51.870 --> 31:56.958
The president's plane lands at the air base next to Pittsburgh's airport -

31:57.000 --> 32:00.128
- When President Collins arrives today to visit the site -

32:00.211 --> 32:04.424
- For yesterday's terrorist attack on Snyder Building.

32:04.507 --> 32:09.721
The space at Ground Zero is limited, everyone wants to make a contribution.

32:09.804 --> 32:15.268
Remember that everyone has a special place in the relief effort -

32:15.352 --> 32:19.522
- And we will continue until we no longer needed.

32:44.506 --> 32:49.427
Excuse me, are you Art Boyd? -This Is private land.

32:50.095 --> 32:55.141
-Your Office said you were here. -This Is private, I'll call the police.

32:55.225 --> 33:00.605
-Have You signed these documents? -I'll call.

33:14.160 --> 33:17.080
-How's it going? I can not let you pass.

33:17.163 --> 33:20.000
I belong to the media. I can not pass up

33:20.083 --> 33:23.586
-No Unauthorized come by here. I'll shoot the president.

33:23.670 --> 33:26.548
You have to turn the car.

33:28.049 --> 33:34.055
My boss will kill me. You must give me a few minutes.

33:37.225 --> 33:39.185
- -Thanks.

33:42.313 --> 33:45.150
-Put Down the phone. -Jesus, Do not kill me.

33:45.233 --> 33:51.031
Why did you write on the papers? Oskana Rowan? Yakov Dimitri?

33:51.114 --> 33:54.159
They needed a decoy. -For what?

33:54.242 --> 34:00.040
A cosignatory of contracts, loans, find jobs. To look away.

34:00.081 --> 34:02.292
-From what? -From Their money.

34:02.375 --> 34:08.005
Someone who covered up their suspicious transactions and transfers.

34:08.089 --> 34:12.052
You are their banker. -Bank. Connection. I control their accounts.

34:12.135 --> 34:15.804
-Why you? -My Bank's Zurich office sent them.

34:15.889 --> 34:20.018
I thought they were Saudis, immigrants who avoided tax.

34:20.101 --> 34:21.811
They are terrorists!

34:41.748 --> 34:45.627
You have to understand. Their first deposit sued.

34:45.710 --> 34:50.215
I was asked to just manage it. How much do they have?

34:50.297 --> 34:52.592
25 million.

34:53.927 --> 34:56.638
I need the account. -No.

35:24.541 --> 35:29.796
Understand that I need to come in to your account to track down the guy.

35:29.879 --> 35:35.510
They have my internet. Track my mobile. Monitors my accounts. They kill me.

35:35.969 --> 35:41.099
Finding team leader is my only chance to survive the day.

35:41.182 --> 35:47.564
I know all about them. That you were not involved. I can cleanse you of the FBI.

35:47.647 --> 35:51.651
It must be their leader. I can attest to your innocence.

35:51.735 --> 35:55.363
-People Just listen to the leader. It's not time.

35:56.114 --> 35:58.867
For what?

36:00.660 --> 36:02.829
-Time For what? I need a few minutes.

36:02.912 --> 36:06.583
-For what? Time for what? -To Publish the account.

36:06.666 --> 36:07.876
-For who? -Media.

36:07.959 --> 36:09.669
Why?

36:12.881 --> 36:14.382
Why?

36:16.926 --> 36:19.471
It will happen ...

36:22.265 --> 36:26.728
Hundreds of relief workers have gathered at Ground Zero -

36:26.811 --> 36:33.193
- To greet the presidential Collins arrives to show them their support.

36:33.485 --> 36:38.323
President Collins visit will boost the nation's morale.

37:07.268 --> 37:12.524
I need a name. I have to find their leaders.

37:43.430 --> 37:45.140
Please.

37:45.890 --> 37:49.060
It's my only chance.

37:49.144 --> 37:53.356
Mikel ... ons.

38:02.407 --> 38:05.243
-Razanov.
 -Ja.

38:06.870 --> 38:12.125
I had to kill the banker. -Why?

38:12.584 --> 38:17.964
It was only a few minutes left. -Amerikanen. He is here.

38:20.967 --> 38:28.683
Ivan, it is crucial for our plan to the bank account is released to the media.

38:29.976 --> 38:31.936
No problem.

38:41.363 --> 38:44.783
-Where is he? Do you think you can stop this?

38:44.866 --> 38:46.201
Where is Razanov?

38:49.287 --> 38:52.999
Al Fahad is so much stronger than you think.

38:57.879 --> 39:01.049
Tell me where he is! I need a doctor!

39:01.132 --> 39:04.803
Give me a place! -Ground Zero.

39:22.445 --> 39:27.283
... Now switches on to Ground Zero's intelligence office in Quantico.

39:27.367 --> 39:28.785
Lady, this is not a tip!

39:28.868 --> 39:36.251
From our soldiers, our police officers, it is you we are looking for, and thank.

39:36.376 --> 39:38.503
The strikes against the town again!

39:38.586 --> 39:44.801
I am a member of the FBI and do not intend to be called "Lady", you understand?

39:45.552 --> 39:50.598
Listen, I'm the man who bombed Snyder Building.

39:50.682 --> 39:56.771
And I will confess my crime. And you want to speak with Agent Carter?

40:03.236 --> 40:09.784
Make sure that the account information is sent. And that the American did not escape.

40:11.578 --> 40:14.372
Thank you for contacting ...

40:20.211 --> 40:22.422
I need a doctor.

40:23.631 --> 40:27.802
-Have You found it yet? -Razanov Said he has it on.

40:29.262 --> 40:32.098
-Continue Look. -Where is it?

40:47.072 --> 40:48.323
End.

40:49.949 --> 40:55.663
Your Arse! Take the phone! Someone wants to talk to Carter about a new attack!

40:59.626 --> 41:03.171
Carter, someone wants to talk to you.

41:04.673 --> 41:06.800
Yeah, it's Carter? -Listen, Carter.

41:07.425 --> 41:13.014
-Listen. Other goal is not LA I can not hear you.

41:19.729 --> 41:25.193
There was no attack. I repeat, the president is the target.

41:27.070 --> 41:31.408
It's not LA It's the president. I repeat, it's the president.

41:31.491 --> 41:34.452
Carter, listen. You must...

41:43.294 --> 41:46.172
I must immediately talk to the Secret Service.

41:48.258 --> 41:50.760
-I've got it. -Send It!

41:50.885 --> 41:53.888
Clear. We find on something.

41:55.140 --> 41:57.934
My name is Art Boyd.

42:00.228 --> 42:02.313
Good. Disconnect front me.

42:02.731 --> 42:06.192
It will challenge all of us forever.

42:06.276 --> 42:12.907
Now we have to face that threatened us for so many centuries.

42:13.575 --> 42:16.745
Freedom is not free.

42:20.540 --> 42:23.084
Stupid American!

42:23.209 --> 42:26.338
Why our enemies choose death over ...

42:26.421 --> 42:31.760
So far I have not done anything ...

42:51.446 --> 42:57.452
It is now the rest of us are confronted with what so many men and women died ...

42:57.577 --> 43:01.206
-to seize the dangerous terrorists.

43:03.291 --> 43:05.085
No no no!

43:17.931 --> 43:20.350
Take president therefrom.

43:39.077 --> 43:41.413
No Signal

43:43.164 --> 43:47.210
Sorry, I'm not sure what just happened -

43:47.293 --> 43:51.297
- But we have certainly lost our satellite connection ...

43:52.340 --> 43:56.845
We are working on the satellite signal. We have problems with it.

43:56.928 --> 44:03.268
I hear that there's been an explosion. Yes, an explosion.

44:43.350 --> 44:46.561
You let a bunch of journalists see your money.

44:50.023 --> 44:54.027
Victor has sent the account?

44:57.280 --> 45:00.825
Victor has sent the account?

45:02.369 --> 45:05.997
Come on, Victor. If the account sent?

45:22.180 --> 45:26.267
Why do you think the media should see your finances?

45:37.904 --> 45:41.366
It might get more.

45:45.370 --> 45:47.789
You put your me.

45:47.872 --> 45:51.918
We needed someone who diverted authorities.

45:52.002 --> 45:53.878
Why me?

45:53.962 --> 46:01.011
For that you thought you could just leave it all behind you.

46:18.403 --> 46:25.952
You were just like an American tourist. Sweaty and full of fear.

46:32.917 --> 46:36.046
Are you ready, my friend?

46:40.967 --> 46:45.430
Your brothers wanted me to bomb a US Embassy.

46:45.513 --> 46:50.977
We needed to know about your hatred was genuine. I gave you my word.

46:51.061 --> 46:54.397
Not your life.

46:58.735 --> 47:06.117
-You Do not need it anymore. You abandoned your fate, Mr. Taylor.

47:08.286 --> 47:12.874
I was not going to commit suicide to prove my loyalty.

47:12.957 --> 47:18.463
When will this be your living hell.

47:23.718 --> 47:29.641
I just want you to tell them that I had nothing to do with this.

47:29.766 --> 47:35.146
Why would I risk my credibility for a coward?

47:38.358 --> 47:42.278
The police will kill me.

47:43.530 --> 47:46.783
Think of it as your sacrifice.

47:57.293 --> 48:00.505
You do not want to help me.

48:01.297 --> 48:05.468
I find yourself. You bastard!

48:05.885 --> 48:12.017
Where are you hiding? Show me. Where are you hiding?

48:32.787 --> 48:37.250
The suspect is moving. All units, Heed caution.

48:53.141 --> 48:56.770
-Yes. It's Carter. -Mikel Razanov.

48:57.604 --> 49:02.233
He called Mikel Razanov.
He is the man in the mask.

49:02.317 --> 49:05.362
Al Fahads leaders.

49:05.445 --> 49:08.907
You must contact the media. One of the news channels.

49:08.990 --> 49:12.118
He sent them their statements, for some reason.

49:12.202 --> 49:15.622
I think he's planning something.

49:16.539 --> 49:17.832
Carter?

49:20.043 --> 49:23.588
Why did the CIA definitely make a deal with you?

49:23.672 --> 49:28.760
-Sorry? Why was your silence so valuable?

49:35.684 --> 49:42.691
They did not want people to know that they made a deal with me earlier.

49:51.074 --> 49:53.952
All units and ambulances responding.

49:54.035 --> 49:56.830
My team is gone.

49:58.415 --> 49:59.749
They are dead.

50:01.793 --> 50:06.923
Cops, techniques, intervention teams.
All are dead.

50:07.674 --> 50:12.387
You sent us into a trap.

50:17.058 --> 50:19.144
I did not know.

50:19.811 --> 50:26.860
The only thing I regret now, of course, is that I killed you before.

50:30.822 --> 50:34.534
-Carter. -Yes.

50:37.037 --> 50:41.041
This is not over.

50:52.010 --> 50:57.557
Come then. Come then. Sit down!

50:57.640 --> 51:02.145
... men in the president Confidential Tyrka
 executed on the spot ...

51:02.228 --> 51:04.314
I've had enough of this shit!

51:04.397 --> 51:08.151
The FBI and Secret Service uses all the staff ...

51:08.193 --> 51:12.947
Your pigs. You think you can come to my country.

51:13.031 --> 51:15.825
... That the chances of finding alive the president's small ...

51:15.909 --> 51:22.248
You think you can kill my people. My men will find me.

51:23.041 --> 51:27.629
They will not negotiate. We do not negotiate with terrorists.

51:27.712 --> 51:34.135
This is probably no negotiation, right, Mr. President?

51:44.354 --> 51:50.568
News organizations across the country have received bank information that can -

51:50.985 --> 51:55.031
- Belong to the newly formed terrorist network Al Fahad.

51:55.073 --> 51:59.494
Al Fahads finance purchases and transactions are here, Swiss numbered accounts.

51:59.577 --> 52:03.123
How did the media get it so quickly? -Bankiren Let it out.

52:03.206 --> 52:07.669
... Sent to news outlets throughout the country by the late banker Art Boyd.

52:07.752 --> 52:11.047
It seems to be his last attempt to redress -

52:11.131 --> 52:14.384
- Who confessed that he wanted to reveal the terror network.

52:14.467 --> 52:16.970
Poor bastard, Al Fahad sent six guys on him.

52:17.053 --> 52:22.308
...carnage. The property was studded with Al Fahad terrorists' bodies.

52:22.392 --> 52:28.023
Sources say that the men would prevent Boyd to release the information.

52:28.106 --> 52:33.194
Why he sent it to us? He had everything on these guys.

52:33.570 --> 52:35.447
What is it?

52:37.115 --> 52:40.827
Two millions. It says nothing.

52:42.037 --> 52:47.459
Next transaction for location on a freighter from Kazakhstan.

52:47.542 --> 52:52.255
Whatever it was that went around it. Caspian to the Iran-

52:52.339 --> 52:55.050
-ner to Sydatlanten-

52:55.133 --> 52:57.218
-studsade around South America for a few months.

52:57.302 --> 52:59.846
They use trafficked roads.

52:59.929 --> 53:02.432
Delivery: United States

53:02.974 --> 53:05.352
For what?

53:08.355 --> 53:12.400
Ge mig all information
om Mikel Razanov.

53:13.860 --> 53:15.737
Unknown Load

53:36.299 --> 53:40.970
Carter, a Swiss bank account belonging to the name you gave us.

53:41.054 --> 53:44.974
The transactions gave us a new clue. An industrial building in Hyde Park.

53:45.100 --> 53:49.396
I give you a new tactical unit. Prepare them for a raid.

53:49.479 --> 53:52.982
I think Razanov sent into a weapon in the country.

53:53.066 --> 53:57.779
... Pressing issues remain this afternoon.

53:57.862 --> 54:03.326
What can the terrorist leader Mikel Razanovs bank tell me about him -

54:03.368 --> 54:05.495
-and his organization?

54:05.578 --> 54:10.959
Across the country following financial experts and journalists all the clues.

54:11.793 --> 54:15.046
Can not miss the opportunity. You have to act urgently -

54:15.130 --> 54:19.342
- Before everyone shows up there and chase him away.

54:23.263 --> 54:31.312
The pressure is on to arrest Mikel Razanov hitherto escaped increasing every minute.

54:31.396 --> 54:37.569
Who exactly, or what, is financing the Chechen-born terrorist?

55:30.747 --> 55:32.415
Razanov!

55:34.834 --> 55:39.547
You come with me and you'll tell the truth.

55:52.686 --> 55:55.438
It's a trap.

56:02.195 --> 56:05.573
Hello, brave American man.

56:06.408 --> 56:13.915
The last day you have raged over to your nation was attacked.

56:14.624 --> 56:18.628
You came here in the name of justice.

56:18.712 --> 56:23.842
But I assure you that you just followed my call.

56:25.844 --> 56:30.432
The free world's leaders sitting in this room.

56:30.724 --> 56:37.689
For over two centuries, the world has worshiped his position of power.

56:38.189 --> 56:43.903
Today, I give you the chance to relieve yourself.

56:46.031 --> 56:53.121
In front of you a device that traveled many mil to be here today.

56:53.204 --> 56:58.501
Some would call it a weapon of mass destruction.

56:58.585 --> 57:05.633
I prefer the term ... Code blue suitcase.

57:15.602 --> 57:21.900
Now you get to see the true meaning of democracy.

57:22.025 --> 57:27.822
The timer is programmed with more than enough time for you to make a decision -

57:27.906 --> 57:31.117
- But it is not battery powered -

57:31.201 --> 57:37.332
- But run by the president himself.

57:38.208 --> 57:40.752
Of his heartbeat.

57:45.256 --> 57:48.843
The longer his heart continues to pump blood -

57:48.927 --> 57:54.849
- The longer it will continue to run the timer -

57:54.933 --> 57:57.769
- To zero.

58:10.699 --> 58:18.581
If the connection between the president and the device is broken detonate immediately.

58:19.332 --> 58:25.130
The game is simple. Save your country.

58:30.885 --> 58:32.345
We go!

58:38.893 --> 58:44.733
I thought you were with Al Fahad. No, sir. I'm an American.

58:44.816 --> 58:46.818
Thank good God.

59:06.629 --> 59:12.844
Nothing. From the FBI, CIA or Interpol. We have something of the FSB.

59:12.927 --> 59:14.512
Is the Russian guy?

59:14.637 --> 59:20.935
Born as Mikel S. Razanov in March 1985 in Grozny in the Chechen Republic.

59:21.269 --> 59:25.732
Permanently disfigured after a drönarattack against his terrorist camps.

59:27.192 --> 59:31.780
Hides that they could not cook under a mask.

59:32.238 --> 59:36.785
He was only in the database because of dealings with IAPB.

59:37.535 --> 59:42.540
-As Al Fahad is Chechen. It's a utbrytarcell.

59:42.832 --> 59:47.420
-From IAPB? -From Al-Qaeda.

59:48.463 --> 59:55.053
You said he's Chechens. He left Russia in the 2000s.

59:55.136 --> 59:58.682
The following seven years he went about in the Middle East

59:58.765 --> 01:00:02.018
-and worked for a big shot in Al-Qaeda.

01:00:02.102 --> 01:00:04.062
Comes?

01:00:08.733 --> 01:00:11.361
Usama bin Ladin.

01:00:23.123 --> 01:00:27.711
Mr. President, try to remember. Did they say anything about where they were going next?

01:00:27.794 --> 01:00:32.048
-No. -Nothing That may give a clue to them?

01:00:34.801 --> 01:00:37.470
-No. -Damn!

01:01:00.869 --> 01:01:06.332
I have to call the Secret Service. -No. They would stop the car.

01:01:14.507 --> 01:01:17.093
You brave Americans.

01:01:20.972 --> 01:01:26.728
-Stay, And let me out. -I Can not do.

01:01:28.188 --> 01:01:31.107
Why not?

01:01:31.232 --> 01:01:34.569
The device is powered by the master heartbeat.

01:01:34.652 --> 01:01:36.529
Razanov submitted film.

01:01:36.613 --> 01:01:41.618
The president must be executed for the weapon to be deactivated.

01:01:41.701 --> 01:01:46.456
The game is simple. Need to save your country?

01:01:46.539 --> 01:01:53.338
He who owns the gas station across the street saw Ryan fifteen minutes ago.

01:01:53.421 --> 01:01:57.425
He swears that the president was with him.

01:02:03.515 --> 01:02:07.686
Yes, I have the president. -

01:02:07.769 --> 01:02:11.731
Do not worry, he's all right. -Is It real?

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:16.611
It seems so.
Carter, there's more.

01:02:17.904 --> 01:02:22.158
Razanovs bankers did not send the account to the media.

01:02:22.659 --> 01:02:25.745
It was Razanov. -What?

01:02:25.829 --> 01:02:29.290
I do not know why, but he wants people to see his finances.

01:02:29.374 --> 01:02:33.920
It's not the bomb. Let me talk to the president.

01:02:37.966 --> 01:02:44.222
Sir, this is Special Agent Ron Carter. How much time do we have?

01:02:46.099 --> 01:02:52.147
-Omkring An hour and a half. They thought Nayok as we speak.

01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:56.443
Give us the place and we will send a team.

01:02:57.944 --> 01:03:02.991
I think we just turned the Yellow Belt. And I think...

01:03:04.492 --> 01:03:07.287
-Track The phone. -Yes.

01:03:09.622 --> 01:03:14.169
They take this car. I can drive you to Nayok.

01:03:19.924 --> 01:03:23.887
I'm the only one you can trust right now.

01:03:24.179 --> 01:03:26.848
Razanov appeals to citizens to act -

01:03:26.973 --> 01:03:31.603
- While the authorities were asking residents to be calm -

01:03:38.818 --> 01:03:42.030
- And ignore Razanovs appeals.

01:03:42.072 --> 01:03:45.533
When we come back, if it can save millions -

01:03:45.617 --> 01:03:49.704
- Would it even ethical to assassinate US President?

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:54.709
Stay.

01:04:01.508 --> 01:04:06.054
While an entire city is facing possible extinction -

01:04:06.137 --> 01:04:08.306
- Require Americans act.

01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:11.768
The president is the leader. He must take control.

01:04:11.851 --> 01:04:14.646
-Who cares? Bomb them! -Go and die!

01:04:23.405 --> 01:04:28.993
Do you think he will try to negotiate with us ... about the president?

01:04:33.581 --> 01:04:38.253
-About what? -Immunity.

01:04:42.257 --> 01:04:47.887
We have him on the way west. 376; 15.

01:04:48.972 --> 01:04:50.932
-Okay. Units ready. -Yes.

01:04:51.016 --> 01:04:56.521
- We have been latching on to the president.
- Copy that. Do we bet permission?

01:04:57.814 --> 01:05:02.569
-Repetera It.
- To kill. Do we have permission?

01:05:03.111 --> 01:05:06.906
It is the US president, sergeant.

01:05:07.032 --> 01:05:11.036
- Not anymore.
-Repeat.

01:05:12.078 --> 01:05:17.125
Your buddies on Capitol Hill just voted him away.

01:05:22.922 --> 01:05:26.176
You must stop this. -Kongressen Have already decided.

01:05:26.259 --> 01:05:31.097
He is America's president. And tied to a nuclear bomb.

01:05:44.736 --> 01:05:48.782
25th Amendment says that if the president can not perform his ämbete

01:05:48.865 --> 01:05:50.658
-is vice president director.

01:05:50.742 --> 01:05:53.620
We do not know if Razanov telling the truth about the bomb.

01:05:53.703 --> 01:05:56.081
He has convinced Congress.

01:06:01.378 --> 01:06:04.255
And? Should we just shoot him off the road?

01:06:04.381 --> 01:06:08.677
Carter, they found this guy in a terrorist training camp.

01:06:11.137 --> 01:06:15.684
Why do you think the CIA wanted a deal with him?

01:06:16.643 --> 01:06:19.270
I do not understand.

01:06:20.438 --> 01:06:24.776
2008. The guy sticks from his Marine Corps unit.

01:06:26.194 --> 01:06:30.782
Next, find the CIA him beaming with al - Qaeda in a training camp.

01:06:31.157 --> 01:06:37.288
Why he was charged not then. He revealed the camp's location.

01:06:45.088 --> 01:06:47.924
The guy is totally unreliable.

01:06:48.008 --> 01:06:51.469
He do not care who he betrays.

01:06:56.725 --> 01:07:01.229
Bannings ... he has not killed him yet.

01:07:03.732 --> 01:07:09.029
He leaves it to Washington. -What does it mean?

01:07:09.988 --> 01:07:15.368
Carter, you know the situation. We do not negotiate with terrorists.

01:07:21.416 --> 01:07:25.211
Authorities warn civilians to stay away from I3 - 76 Parkway.

01:07:25.295 --> 01:07:27.714
We have not been informed why.

01:07:27.839 --> 01:07:32.260
Sources said that a large military operation to take place in the area.

01:07:32.344 --> 01:07:35.597
We warn everyone to stay away.

01:07:41.102 --> 01:07:46.566
Hell! They have a helicopter up in the ass on us!

01:08:05.043 --> 01:08:09.297
-Bort Here! Jesus! -Hold on!

01:08:22.894 --> 01:08:26.648
How can one believe that they can evacuate an entire city?

01:08:26.689 --> 01:08:29.776
We have to save Pittsburgh's residents and the now.

01:08:39.118 --> 01:08:41.328
Away from the road!

01:08:49.546 --> 01:08:54.551
Have Americans lost faith? Have we been reduced to kill or be killed?

01:08:54.634 --> 01:08:58.763
Some call it unethical, others survival.

01:08:58.846 --> 01:09:00.640
I have a heart attack!

01:09:00.724 --> 01:09:06.020
Are we ready to sacrifice of our own lives to save millions of lives?

01:09:20.910 --> 01:09:22.412
Move, asshole!

01:10:33.525 --> 01:10:38.029
-Get Away from me! -Ryan, You have to give him up.

01:10:38.071 --> 01:10:41.199
They'll kill him! He is not president anymore.

01:10:41.282 --> 01:10:44.285
We both know that they are trying to save their own skins.

01:10:44.327 --> 01:10:50.083
He is attached to a nuclear bomb. And we can still stop it.

01:10:51.626 --> 01:10:55.547
Yes. Right now the whole government to have his head.

01:10:55.630 --> 01:10:59.300
Therefore, we must keep our.

01:11:01.761 --> 01:11:07.559
We have to get him on a helicopter. -Then Exploding bomb.

01:11:08.309 --> 01:11:12.230
Razanov satte en GPS-navigator
på bomben.

01:11:12.313 --> 01:11:19.571
Raises he slams the bomb. He leaves the city as slamming the bomb.

01:11:36.463 --> 01:11:40.467
I am sending information about a safe house. I'm putting together a team.

01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:44.095
Is it men you can trust?

01:11:44.888 --> 01:11:49.934
Get rid of the phone. The device can only track you visually.

01:12:53.331 --> 01:12:58.503
Do everything clearly. We are short of time when they will.

01:13:03.466 --> 01:13:07.929
Mr. President, can you go through Razanovs account

01:13:08.013 --> 01:13:14.269
-and tell me whether any transaction will lead us to a place other than where we were.

01:13:15.186 --> 01:13:17.814
A cash withdrawals.

01:13:20.108 --> 01:13:23.278
Socket. Cash. Cash.

01:13:23.403 --> 01:13:27.449
Some other transactions, but these are just cash.

01:13:27.574 --> 01:13:29.075
Who is funding him?

01:13:29.117 --> 01:13:35.498
What can the terrorist leader Mikel Razanovs bank account tell us about him?

01:13:37.292 --> 01:13:42.130
The first deposit was made in April 2011.

01:13:43.506 --> 01:13:48.094
Oh. $ 25 million from Avco Oil.

01:13:48.178 --> 01:13:53.850
Can you find a place? -Huvudkontoret Is at 332 5th Avenue.

01:13:54.351 --> 01:13:57.645
-Where is it? -Ground Zero.

01:13:57.771 --> 01:14:01.399
-Snyder Building? -Third floor.

01:14:03.151 --> 01:14:06.863
Why bomb its own investors?

01:14:07.489 --> 01:14:10.033
It is a shell company. -How do you know that?

01:14:10.116 --> 01:14:13.286
Their large bills in an advertisement consultancy.

01:14:13.411 --> 01:14:18.625
The website says it is a listed company but Avco Oil is not on the Nasdaq.

01:14:18.708 --> 01:14:21.836
All major transfers goes to Swiss numbered accounts.

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:24.214
Can we trace the DBA?

01:14:26.424 --> 01:14:28.677
Find no name.

01:14:29.386 --> 01:14:35.433
The head office is here. The registration took place in Virginia.

01:14:38.603 --> 01:14:39.979
Where?

01:14:43.775 --> 01:14:45.402
limited Access

01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:48.613
It comes from Langley.

01:14:51.574 --> 01:14:54.244
Yes. Connect me to Banning.

01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:05.255
Financial experts and journalists in the country ...

01:15:05.338 --> 01:15:08.883
Yes. You must isolate the bank accounts.

01:15:08.967 --> 01:15:12.262
It's a trap! You need to muzzle them.

01:15:12.303 --> 01:15:16.391
Who, or what, is financing the Chechen-born terrorist?

01:15:16.474 --> 01:15:21.187
Experts believe that the answer to the question can lead to Razanov once and for all.

01:15:21.271 --> 01:15:27.527
Okay, Mr. President, we'll try to get you to these cables in some way.

01:15:27.610 --> 01:15:32.490
We'll go through them, see how they are linked to bomben

01:15:32.574 --> 01:15:36.119
-and ensure that it does not slam in our faces.

01:15:36.202 --> 01:15:39.539
Our team of investigators could trace themselves Mikel ...

01:15:39.622 --> 01:15:43.877
We found something deep into account that will cause a shit storm.

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:47.339
... A Swiss bank account with a balance ...

01:15:47.422 --> 01:15:49.841
We must remove the account from the broadcasts.

01:15:49.924 --> 01:15:55.138
This is the important thing. The financing of Razonovs terrorist organization ...

01:15:55.221 --> 01:16:00.435
The first deposit came from an oil company in the Middle East, Avco Oil.

01:16:00.518 --> 01:16:06.066
When we dug deeper showed our confirmed reports -

01:16:06.149 --> 01:16:12.364
- That the money now financing Mikel Razanov came directly from the CIA.

01:16:17.202 --> 01:16:20.622
Experts confirm that the transactions have taken place -

01:16:20.705 --> 01:16:26.002
- Even if they do not know why the CIA directly finance foreign terrorists.

01:16:26.419 --> 01:16:30.632
After these discoveries, accusing the Justice Department -

01:16:30.715 --> 01:16:36.137
- Senior officials of the CIA to have financed yesterday's terrorist attack.

01:16:43.937 --> 01:16:49.109
What you see on screen is Mikel Razonovs Swiss bank account.

01:16:49.192 --> 01:16:53.196
At the top you see the original financing from Avco Oil -

01:16:53.279 --> 01:16:57.367
- Which is a decoy group for the CIA.

01:16:57.450 --> 01:16:58.827
Bank account.

01:17:03.081 --> 01:17:06.418
There is no time for X-rays.

01:17:24.853 --> 01:17:29.315
Stop damaging our people! Why are you so against our people?

01:17:37.407 --> 01:17:41.494
America must stand up. We do not take this.

01:17:42.829 --> 01:17:46.332
That was why he put the account.

01:17:46.416 --> 01:17:49.336
We must protest!

01:18:03.475 --> 01:18:08.063
I think it is time that we send our message.

01:18:10.732 --> 01:18:16.196
-Ryan, What do you do? We can still find Razanov.

01:18:17.322 --> 01:18:24.079
-Joe, We must hurry to this bit. Give me a couple of seconds.

01:18:24.162 --> 01:18:30.627
I can give you all the time in the world, but that the bomb does not give you much.

01:18:31.628 --> 01:18:36.716
The account was a trap for us. Ryan, the country collapses.

01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:42.222
We need to find this man. Look. Look!

01:18:43.973 --> 01:18:47.310
The first outlet was in UK, London.

01:18:47.894 --> 01:18:52.482
Cash withdrawals at Heathrow International, then nothing before he came to the United States.

01:18:52.565 --> 01:18:54.442
Which means?

01:19:00.990 --> 01:19:06.413
They laundered money. -Nan Who hid their transactions.

01:19:06.496 --> 01:19:09.582
He laundered money.

01:19:12.127 --> 01:19:16.673
Someone did their banking on this. Can you go into the account?

01:19:16.756 --> 01:19:20.760
-Yes. Whose is it? -A Bankirs.

01:19:30.478 --> 01:19:34.983
-Wait. It's a delay. -How long?

01:19:36.234 --> 01:19:39.863
I can give you ten seconds.

01:19:44.159 --> 01:19:47.704
John, ring upp stadsingenjören.

01:19:49.831 --> 01:19:51.082
Bingo!

01:19:55.003 --> 01:19:58.465
They used the banker's account to all purchases.

01:19:58.590 --> 01:20:03.762
Look? April 2011, transaction with First Industrial.

01:20:08.391 --> 01:20:13.355
-Do You Razanov are there? I know that he is there.

01:20:19.027 --> 01:20:21.988
What helps to find the guy? -Not at all.

01:20:22.072 --> 01:20:25.200
-What are you doing then? I do not want to end up on death row.

01:20:25.283 --> 01:20:29.120
He's a terrorist, Ryan. And the only trustworthy right now.

01:20:29.204 --> 01:20:36.086
And if we can not defuse the bomb? -Then You have to make a decision.

01:20:36.544 --> 01:20:40.006
The engineers can not stop it.

01:20:40.924 --> 01:20:45.303
Ryan, there's not enough time.

01:20:46.888 --> 01:20:50.308
But an engineer found a tunnel at Parkway.

01:20:50.392 --> 01:20:53.144
He is confident that it can contain the explosion.

01:20:53.228 --> 01:20:57.440
We already evacuating the area.

01:20:58.108 --> 01:21:01.319
Why are you telling me?

01:21:02.445 --> 01:21:05.782
Because they found a lag on the heart monitor.

01:21:05.824 --> 01:21:11.746
If the change takes a few seconds notice no difference sensor.

01:21:13.289 --> 01:21:17.460
The bomb needs a heart, Ryan.

01:21:18.753 --> 01:21:22.549
At least until detonation.

01:21:28.304 --> 01:21:30.890
Sorry, Agent Carter.

01:21:30.974 --> 01:21:34.686
These people are not worth dying for.

01:21:54.497 --> 01:21:58.793
As you will see, I am not your enemy.

01:21:58.877 --> 01:22:03.506
I come to you as a messenger to his king.

01:22:06.634 --> 01:22:10.055
I'm going with ... warning.

01:22:11.806 --> 01:22:18.813
From now on, you imperialist government protect you from -

01:22:20.815 --> 01:22:23.401
- The truth.

01:22:24.402 --> 01:22:29.282
After today, they will show you their true colors.

01:22:29.366 --> 01:22:33.328
An assault rifle in each soldier's hand.

01:22:33.370 --> 01:22:40.001
Barbed wire on every lamppost and on every street corner.

01:22:40.085 --> 01:22:44.589
Concentration camps for those who do not want to believe in the lies -

01:22:44.673 --> 01:22:47.467
- Safety and security -

01:22:47.801 --> 01:22:50.845
-will be opened.

01:22:50.929 --> 01:22:54.599
Okay, gentlemen, now do I remove the IV message.

01:22:54.683 --> 01:23:00.939
Since we have only seconds until the bomb realize that it is not attached to your arm.

01:23:01.064 --> 01:23:07.278
I send it to the agent Carter's arm. Agent Carter, are you ready for this?

01:23:07.362 --> 01:23:11.950
For years, you've seen the police state growing.

01:23:11.991 --> 01:23:15.829
Now it's your war.

01:23:15.912 --> 01:23:20.166
Security Service loading up against its most unlikely foe to date -

01:23:20.250 --> 01:23:21.793
-United People.

01:23:21.918 --> 01:23:27.799
You must fight. You must resist.

01:23:28.466 --> 01:23:32.637
You must rise against their fear.

01:23:32.721 --> 01:23:34.723
Agent Carter.

01:23:36.099 --> 01:23:41.354
- Okay, here we go.

01:24:38.495 --> 01:24:43.541
It's time for the big sacrifice, my king.

01:24:44.084 --> 01:24:47.504
Awesome. I'm sending it to the media.

01:24:48.004 --> 01:24:49.923
Kom, Razanov.

01:24:51.966 --> 01:24:56.471
-Yes?
- It's American. He is here.

01:24:56.554 --> 01:24:59.891
- Kill him then.
-I can not.

01:25:01.685 --> 01:25:03.520
Why not?

01:25:19.828 --> 01:25:21.871
Leave us.

01:25:21.955 --> 01:25:26.626
You thought I would just go away.

01:25:29.504 --> 01:25:31.506
But I'm here now.

01:25:37.012 --> 01:25:43.059
-To Get me to confess? -To Clear my name.

01:25:44.144 --> 01:25:49.983
-It Would take a life. -If Necessary.

01:25:50.775 --> 01:25:57.574
But it was not because you abandoned us to go to the CIA?

01:26:01.411 --> 01:26:05.457
I realized that my job over there was not worth it anymore.

01:26:05.582 --> 01:26:07.667
And it was?

01:26:10.045 --> 01:26:12.964
Finding bin Laden.

01:26:15.759 --> 01:26:17.093
And kill him.

01:26:17.177 --> 01:26:24.434
Oh. After all this time, you're just an infidel.

01:26:37.989 --> 01:26:43.453
I must warn you to think twice about your cause.

01:26:44.204 --> 01:26:49.125
While death for your cause might be easy for you-

01:26:49.209 --> 01:26:54.923
-so get documents ... consequences.

01:27:03.765 --> 01:27:08.144
If the president's death would stop the detonation

01:27:09.688 --> 01:27:16.194
- So would my ... literally guarantee.

01:27:26.079 --> 01:27:27.997
Nothing To Fear

01:27:29.416 --> 01:27:36.006
There is no greater victory, no greater destiny than death.

01:27:36.673 --> 01:27:43.847
Ryan! Ryan, come! It was fake! The bomb was a fake!

01:27:43.930 --> 01:27:49.728
Do you know what his biggest regret was our friend Osama?

01:27:51.688 --> 01:27:56.860
That he himself flew planes on 11 September.

01:27:58.319 --> 01:28:00.530
Sacrifice.

01:28:01.031 --> 01:28:04.659
It is the warrior's true destiny.

01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:09.706
Not to get old and scared.

01:28:09.998 --> 01:28:17.255
So when a soldier refuses his fate, he must be sacrificed.

01:28:17.839 --> 01:28:22.927
It is his comrades duty to do so.

01:28:23.011 --> 01:28:26.973
That was why they gave you the money.

01:28:27.307 --> 01:28:29.642
You are informant.

01:28:30.352 --> 01:28:35.899
It was you who gave us Usama bin Ladin.

01:28:38.443 --> 01:28:45.658
He had outlived their usefulness. -Therefore Bombed to Snyder Building.

01:28:48.244 --> 01:28:51.498
I needed to hide the transaction.

01:28:51.581 --> 01:28:58.755
I could not risk that somebody revealed that I sold my lord ...

01:29:09.099 --> 01:29:13.353
T erroristledaren has just been shot. But we do not know how.

01:29:13.436 --> 01:29:18.733
We give you live phone chat from marine soldier Ryan Taylor -

01:29:18.817 --> 01:29:21.736
- Who were there in yesterday's attack.

01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:26.908
I need the man in the mask. The man on the television.

01:29:29.244 --> 01:29:34.457
- To get me to confess?
- In order to clear my name.

01:29:36.126 --> 01:29:41.548
Millions of Americans rejoice at the news that the CIA payment to Mikel Razanov -

01:29:41.631 --> 01:29:48.430
- Was merely a reward for he gave us Osama bin Laden in April 2011.

01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:56.604
The Taliban and al - Qaeda requires Razanov arrested -

01:29:56.688 --> 01:30:03.236
- For them to administer their own justice against the man they consider a traitor.

01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:26.634
Detonation Commencing

01:30:45.403 --> 01:30:46.863
Carter.

01:30:47.364 --> 01:30:48.531
Come on.

01:30:49.574 --> 01:30:52.744
Ensure that the tunnels are empty.

01:31:03.088 --> 01:31:09.844
Drain tunnels! Drain tunnels! There was a second bomb! He will now!
