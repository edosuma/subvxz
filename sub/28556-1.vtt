01:10.671 --> 01:12.471
Hey, let me get those.

01:12.840 --> 01:13.572
It's okay.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.040
No, it's cool, I got it.

01:15.209 --> 01:16.308
Thanks.

01:16.310 --> 01:18.744
Yeah, thank you.

01:19.513 --> 01:23.048
So, uh, you girls
at the University?

01:23.484 --> 01:24.616
Yeah.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.452
Most of the people in here are.

01:26.454 --> 01:29.455
You're kinda outta the
usual age range, no?

01:29.457 --> 01:32.791
Yeah, well, uh,
I'm not a student.

01:32.927 --> 01:35.928
You don't say?

01:36.430 --> 01:38.363
I did go to university,

01:38.566 --> 01:40.399
in Washington, in the late '60s.

01:40.401 --> 01:43.769
Washington? What are
you doing out here?

01:44.038 --> 01:45.304
Traveling.

01:46.040 --> 01:49.108
So, uh, you girls in a sorority?

01:49.677 --> 01:50.442
Yeah.

01:50.444 --> 01:51.810
Which one?

01:52.012 --> 01:53.412
Why do you wanna know?

01:53.514 --> 01:55.280
Just making conversation.

01:55.282 --> 01:56.982
We're in Chi Omega.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.018
Nice.

02:00.187 --> 02:02.821
Listen, we were
just heading home.

02:02.823 --> 02:04.022
We were?

02:05.860 --> 02:08.693
Uh, it was nice to meet you.

02:08.863 --> 02:10.262
You girls won't stick around?

02:10.264 --> 02:11.497
I'm buying.

02:11.499 --> 02:13.565
No, that's fine.

02:13.567 --> 02:14.867
Thanks again.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.514
Margaret?

05:16.750 --> 05:18.583
Lisa?

07:08.262 --> 07:10.929
So, what have we got?

07:11.031 --> 07:12.130
Female.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.433
I'd say she's about 16 or 17.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.034
Christ.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.114
Ligature marks
around the throat,

07:30.150 --> 07:33.185
no defensive wounds
on the hands,

07:33.887 --> 07:36.588
maybe she was taken by surprise.

07:36.590 --> 07:39.558
Perhaps approached from behind.

07:39.726 --> 07:42.627
She's been in the
water for a while.

08:05.552 --> 08:06.918
Hey.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.653
Hey, honey.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.495
Oh.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.531
Tough day, huh?

08:19.533 --> 08:21.266
You could say that.

08:21.902 --> 08:22.634
Deb home?

08:22.636 --> 08:24.569
Yeah, she's upstairs.

08:24.571 --> 08:28.173
Tell her dinner will
be ready in half hour.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.184
Yeah?

08:43.524 --> 08:44.756
Hey, Dad.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.059
Hey, how was school today?

08:48.262 --> 08:49.594
Ah, you know, the usual.

08:49.596 --> 08:51.897
A main course of
government propaganda

08:51.899 --> 08:53.198
with a side of condescension.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.735
You don't say things like
that to your teachers, do you?

08:56.970 --> 08:57.936
No.

08:57.938 --> 09:00.338
I toe the line like a good girl.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.507
Thank you.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.518
You okay, Dad?

09:13.720 --> 09:16.021
Um, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

09:16.023 --> 09:19.424
Your mother said dinner
will be ready in half hour.

09:19.426 --> 09:21.459
Cool, thanks.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.339
Mm, that's nice.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.241
It's so good.

09:37.644 --> 09:38.376
Water?

09:38.378 --> 09:39.444
- Mm.
- Did you make this

09:39.446 --> 09:40.478
from the box again?

09:41.381 --> 09:42.814
- How did you know?
- 'Cause it's really good.

09:42.816 --> 09:43.682
Cheeky.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.050
And it's better than
your other one.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.484
- Don't be so cheeky.
- Better than my other one?

09:46.486 --> 09:47.118
Mm-hmm.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.520
I don't know.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.024
So...

09:53.026 --> 09:54.259
Mm-hmm?

09:54.261 --> 09:55.694
What's happened today?

09:55.696 --> 09:59.798
Well, you've got a funny
story about Mrs. Appleby,

09:59.800 --> 10:00.532
don't you?

10:01.435 --> 10:03.802
I think she stole the
other neighbor's baby.

10:03.804 --> 10:04.703
What?

10:04.705 --> 10:08.073
Yeah, 'cause I heard crying
coming from her house.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.142
Maybe it was her granddaughter.

10:16.116 --> 10:16.982
Hello?

10:16.984 --> 10:18.950
<i> It's Tom, sorry</i>
<i>to bother you at home,</i>

10:18.952 --> 10:21.186
<i>but you need to hear this.</i>

10:21.188 --> 10:22.120
What is it?

10:22.122 --> 10:23.755
<i>We found three more.</i>

10:23.757 --> 10:24.923
Three more?

10:24.925 --> 10:25.924
<i>Bodies.</i>

10:25.926 --> 10:28.393
<i>In the Green River.</i>

11:03.697 --> 11:05.030
The ligature marks to the neck

11:05.032 --> 11:07.365
are consistent with an
approach from behind.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.701
All the victims share
the same features,

11:09.703 --> 11:10.769
the ligature marks,

11:10.771 --> 11:13.338
no defensive wounds
to the hands or arms,

11:13.340 --> 11:15.707
all had recently had sex.

11:15.876 --> 11:18.076
Both the missing women
worked as prostitutes.

11:18.078 --> 11:21.146
They were last seen at the
SeaTac strip, near the airport.

11:21.148 --> 11:25.183
Looks like we have a
serial killer on our hands.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.219
This isn't random opportunism.

11:28.221 --> 11:30.655
If all the victims share
the same profession,

11:30.657 --> 11:32.624
the killer's
cruising prostitutes.

11:32.626 --> 11:34.459
These women came
with him willingly.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.828
He may well be a regular
down on the strip.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.797
Considering the lack
of defensive marks

11:38.799 --> 11:40.765
and recent sexual activity,

11:40.767 --> 11:43.134
the women could've been
killed post-coitus,

11:43.136 --> 11:45.603
or even mid-coitus.

11:45.605 --> 11:48.640
Clear signs of
sexual motivation.

11:49.576 --> 11:51.609
We've had calls from the press.

11:51.611 --> 11:53.211
This is gonna be big news.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.380
You wanna handle the briefing?

11:55.849 --> 11:57.048
Sure.

11:59.986 --> 12:01.853
Have you
put any surveillance

12:01.855 --> 12:03.655
on the SeaTac strip?

12:04.558 --> 12:06.858
No, not at this stage.

12:06.860 --> 12:10.695
How many officers have you
put onto the task force?

12:10.697 --> 12:14.699
Um, that number I cannot
tell you right now.

12:15.635 --> 12:16.901
We'll get back to you on that.

12:16.903 --> 12:20.672
How much is this
going to cost the taxpayer?

12:20.674 --> 12:22.407
I can't answer that.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.108
Next.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.744
Is there any truth to the rumor

12:25.746 --> 12:28.213
that the police are not
taking this seriously

12:28.215 --> 12:30.081
because it involves prostitutes?

12:30.083 --> 12:33.118
No, there
is no truth in that.

12:33.120 --> 12:33.918
Anyone else?

12:33.920 --> 12:36.755
Well, do you have any suspects?

12:41.294 --> 12:43.795
No, no, no.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.599
Are we done?

12:49.002 --> 12:50.502
Thank you for coming.

12:50.504 --> 12:51.269
Thank you.

13:06.720 --> 13:07.952
Yeah.

13:10.157 --> 13:11.956
Detective Richards?

13:12.959 --> 13:13.658
Yes.

13:13.660 --> 13:14.526
I'm Bob Keller,

13:14.528 --> 13:17.362
I work with the FBI
Behavioral Science Unit.

13:17.664 --> 13:18.897
Come in.

13:28.575 --> 13:32.544
So, what brings
you to Green River?

13:33.980 --> 13:35.547
I saw the press conference.

13:35.549 --> 13:37.048
I thought maybe I could help.

13:37.050 --> 13:40.118
You gonna help me improve
my public relations skills?

13:40.120 --> 13:42.253
You know what we do at the
Behavioral Science Unit,

13:42.255 --> 13:43.855
Detective Richards?

13:43.957 --> 13:45.990
I'm vaguely familiar.

13:47.294 --> 13:48.827
Call me David.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.295
Okay, David.

13:50.297 --> 13:52.997
We develop and provide
programs of training,

13:52.999 --> 13:54.098
research, and consultation

13:54.100 --> 13:55.700
in the behavioral
and social sciences

13:55.702 --> 13:58.670
for the FBI and law
enforcement community.

13:58.672 --> 14:00.805
If you don't catch
this killer quick,

14:00.807 --> 14:04.042
dealing with the press
isn't gonna get any easier.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.710
Well, I've set up a task force,

14:05.712 --> 14:09.147
led by myself and
Detective Tom Johnson.

14:09.149 --> 14:11.583
We've had confirmation
all of the victims

14:11.585 --> 14:15.053
frequented an area
known for prostitution.

14:15.322 --> 14:17.655
It's likely the killer is
a regular visitor there,

14:17.657 --> 14:21.292
so we're staking it out, as
well as the Green River itself.

14:21.294 --> 14:24.395
But it may make it easier to
identify the killer's habits

14:24.397 --> 14:27.232
if we formed a
psychological profile.

14:27.234 --> 14:29.801
And that's something
I can help you with.

14:32.439 --> 14:33.605
Sure.

14:39.679 --> 14:41.179
Have you ever had
any direct experience

14:41.181 --> 14:42.447
with a serial killer,

14:42.449 --> 14:45.383
beyond just consulting
on the case files?

14:45.719 --> 14:46.517
I have.

14:46.519 --> 14:49.587
Back in '74, I was a rookie
detective in King County.

14:49.589 --> 14:53.658
Two girls disappeared from
Lake Sammamish State Park

14:53.660 --> 14:55.126
and several of us were assigned

14:55.128 --> 14:57.061
to assist the Issaquah Police.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.264
I became part of a task force.

14:59.266 --> 15:00.298
We identified Ted Bundy

15:00.300 --> 15:03.001
as the main suspect
in the murders.

15:03.270 --> 15:05.670
You came face to face with him?

15:05.672 --> 15:06.471
Yeah,

15:06.473 --> 15:08.206
I sat in on one of
his first interviews

15:08.208 --> 15:09.774
after he was arrested.

15:11.144 --> 15:12.744
What was he like?

15:13.179 --> 15:18.283
On the surface, very
articulate, always polite.

15:18.351 --> 15:21.886
In many ways, he reminded
me of a politician.

15:21.888 --> 15:22.820
Smart appearance

15:22.822 --> 15:25.490
and he knew how to dance
around the tough questions

15:25.492 --> 15:28.693
and divert the conversation
towards his own agenda.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.528
But you saw through it?

15:30.530 --> 15:34.365
I realized I had a nose
for this kind of thing.

15:34.601 --> 15:38.303
I knew the moment he sat
down in that interview room,

15:38.305 --> 15:41.306
he was wearing a mask of sanity.

15:42.342 --> 15:44.976
I saw the truth
behind those eyes.

15:44.978 --> 15:47.545
He's on death row now, right?

15:49.416 --> 15:50.214
Yeah.

15:50.216 --> 15:51.649
Actually, I've interviewed him
several times

15:51.651 --> 15:52.951
since he was convicted.

15:52.953 --> 15:54.986
There are lots of murders
he hasn't confessed to

15:54.988 --> 15:57.822
and bodies which
we never recovered.

15:57.891 --> 15:59.958
I think he will only
give up the information

15:59.960 --> 16:02.560
if he can get
something out of it,

16:02.562 --> 16:04.896
like a reprieve from execution.

16:04.998 --> 16:09.667
Ironically, for a man who dealt
out so much death to others,

16:09.669 --> 16:11.069
he fears dying.

16:11.604 --> 16:15.540
So, what are your
thoughts on this one, Bob?

16:15.542 --> 16:18.176
Can you help us build a profile?

16:20.347 --> 16:21.879
I'd say so.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.352
Obviously, the first
determination

16:27.354 --> 16:28.419
is that these murders

16:28.421 --> 16:31.856
were very likely the
work of one person.

16:32.092 --> 16:35.593
The same modus operandi
was employed in each death,

16:35.595 --> 16:36.928
and body clusters often suggest

16:36.930 --> 16:39.998
that one individual
is responsible.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.867
He has familiarity
with the Green River

16:42.869 --> 16:44.736
and surrounding area.

16:44.738 --> 16:46.671
This suggests a local man.

16:46.673 --> 16:49.741
He was likely raised in a
family with marital discord

16:49.743 --> 16:51.876
and physically and
emotionally abused.

16:51.878 --> 16:55.213
Possibly even strict religious
or puritanical morals

16:55.215 --> 16:57.949
imposed by one or both parents.

16:58.618 --> 17:03.588
I'd say he's currently between
his mid-20s and mid-30s.

17:03.957 --> 17:06.124
Given that all
the victims so far

17:06.126 --> 17:07.791
have worked in prostitution,

17:07.794 --> 17:09.060
we can assume that the killer

17:09.061 --> 17:11.762
has frequented the red light
district for sexual encounters

17:11.765 --> 17:14.766
which didn't always
end in murder.

17:14.768 --> 17:18.970
However, there will
likely be self-loathing

17:18.972 --> 17:20.570
as a result of these encounters,

17:20.573 --> 17:24.142
and it may trigger his
deep-seated hatred of women.

17:24.144 --> 17:27.545
Murderers who strangle often
speak of an intimate connection

17:27.547 --> 17:30.615
they feel with the
victim as they die.

17:30.817 --> 17:31.983
It's twisted to you and I,

17:31.985 --> 17:34.886
but this man may feel
at his most alive

17:34.888 --> 17:36.788
when he's causing death.

17:36.790 --> 17:39.957
That's why I know
he'll strike again.

17:39.959 --> 17:43.194
Every day, he deals with
the scars of childhood,

17:43.196 --> 17:47.598
poor relationships, and a
generally unremarkable life.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.667
That buzz he gets from killing,

17:49.669 --> 17:53.771
he'll seek it out at every
opportunity available to him.

18:22.302 --> 18:25.803
Strangulation,
same as the others.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.672
How old is she?

18:27.740 --> 18:29.974
I'd say she's in her 30s.

18:30.110 --> 18:31.642
They've all varied in age.

18:31.644 --> 18:35.646
It's clear that isn't a
factor when selecting victims.

18:36.015 --> 18:38.649
I bet this one
works the strip too.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.551
She's been posed
very deliberately.

18:40.553 --> 18:44.188
There's fish and a wine
bottle entwined with her body.

18:44.190 --> 18:45.923
They weren't placed by accident.

18:45.925 --> 18:48.226
He didn't do that with
any of the other victims.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.194
Could be some kind
of religious motive?

18:50.196 --> 18:52.497
That ties in with the
strict religious parents

18:52.499 --> 18:54.732
you mentioned in
the briefing, Bob.

18:54.734 --> 18:55.733
Could be,

18:55.735 --> 18:57.502
could also be game-playing.

18:57.637 --> 18:58.536
How do you mean?

18:58.538 --> 19:00.705
He watches the news
like everybody else,

19:00.707 --> 19:02.006
he could be sending us a message

19:02.008 --> 19:05.376
or having a personal
joke on our expense.

19:05.378 --> 19:07.912
She was stripped
naked like the others,

19:07.914 --> 19:08.913
but they found her dress

19:08.915 --> 19:10.781
just a few yards
down the riverbank.

19:10.783 --> 19:12.683
We bagged it and took it in.

19:12.685 --> 19:15.119
No sign of any
other items so far.

19:15.221 --> 19:17.255
Is he getting sloppy?

19:17.257 --> 19:18.489
Maybe.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.424
Or, like I said,
he's taunting us.

19:20.426 --> 19:22.994
Catch me if you
can, so to speak.

19:42.782 --> 19:44.282
Do you
have any suspects?

19:44.284 --> 19:45.283
Out of the way, please.

19:45.285 --> 19:46.617
Have you
made any arrests?

19:46.619 --> 19:47.451
No comment.

19:47.453 --> 19:48.653
Nothing to say at this stage.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.021
How many
more are gonna die?

19:50.023 --> 19:50.888
Out of the way, please.

19:50.890 --> 19:51.622
Excuse me.

19:51.624 --> 19:52.223
Excuse me.

19:57.330 --> 19:59.797
<i> In Seattle,</i>
<i>another grim discovery today</i>

19:59.799 --> 20:03.301
<i>that could be connected to the
string of Green River murders</i>

20:03.303 --> 20:05.570
<i>that have shaken
that West Coast city.</i>

20:05.572 --> 20:08.573
<i>Explorer scouts today
found a fourth skull</i>

20:08.575 --> 20:10.541
<i>off in a wooded
area outside of town</i>

20:10.543 --> 20:13.878
<i>where three other skeletons
were discovered this weekend.</i>

20:13.880 --> 20:17.782
<i>Most of the victims have
been young prostitutes.</i>

20:17.850 --> 20:21.052
So, Sandra, how did
you and Dave meet?

20:21.120 --> 20:23.854
We actually went to
the same high school,

20:23.856 --> 20:25.690
but we didn't really meet there.

20:25.692 --> 20:29.126
I used to see her in the
stands at the football games.

20:29.128 --> 20:30.328
I found it quite distracting,

20:30.330 --> 20:33.397
pretty sure I missed a few
catches because of her.

20:33.399 --> 20:35.199
Yeah, right.

20:35.201 --> 20:39.737
Anyway, um, I worked after
school at the local library,

20:39.739 --> 20:41.939
my mom worked there for
years, so she got me a job.

20:41.941 --> 20:43.708
It was just around the
corner from my house,

20:43.710 --> 20:47.745
so I'd go in every day after
school,

20:47.747 --> 20:48.946
check out some books.

20:48.948 --> 20:52.717
I'd find pretty much any
excuse to talk to her.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.153
About... after two months,

20:56.155 --> 20:59.757
Dave had this huge
stack of overdue books.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.727
I liked talking to him, so
I didn't wanna remind him,

21:02.729 --> 21:05.896
and, um, then he
realized on his own

21:05.898 --> 21:08.766
and brought in this
big stack of books.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.102
And I told him I would
get rid of the fees

21:11.104 --> 21:14.305
if he took me out to
dinner, which he did,

21:14.307 --> 21:16.207
and here we are.

21:16.676 --> 21:18.109
What a great story.

21:18.578 --> 21:20.011
Are you married, Bob?

21:20.413 --> 21:21.646
I was...

21:22.115 --> 21:23.447
to Kathleen.

21:24.350 --> 21:27.818
She died a year ago, cancer.

21:27.820 --> 21:31.055
Oh, god, I'm so sorry.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.632
Hey, Deb?

21:43.303 --> 21:44.969
What was that about?

21:44.971 --> 21:45.836
I don't know.

21:45.838 --> 21:47.772
Do you want me to
go talk to her?

21:47.840 --> 21:48.906
No,

21:48.908 --> 21:49.940
no,

21:49.942 --> 21:51.142
I'll go.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.144
Excuse me.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.184
What?

22:02.088 --> 22:03.387
You okay?

22:03.389 --> 22:05.156
Not really.

22:05.558 --> 22:07.858
Have I done something wrong?

22:11.531 --> 22:16.600
I'm sorry, it's just, I
was at a party earlier,

22:16.602 --> 22:19.337
some guys started saying things.

22:19.639 --> 22:21.205
About what?

22:22.942 --> 22:24.075
You.

22:24.577 --> 22:26.410
What did they say?

22:28.915 --> 22:30.414
They said everyone in town

22:30.416 --> 22:32.783
knows you're
messing up the case.

22:33.519 --> 22:35.052
Some of them said
that their parents

22:35.054 --> 22:38.889
watch you on the news
and call you names.

22:39.058 --> 22:40.858
What kinda names?

22:40.860 --> 22:44.195
They say you
don't have any balls,

22:44.630 --> 22:50.234
and that you're too weak
to catch the killer.

22:55.108 --> 22:57.408
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

22:58.478 --> 22:59.677
I know it's not your fault,

22:59.679 --> 23:02.346
I'm sorry for getting
mad, it's just--

23:02.348 --> 23:06.317
You have every
right to be annoyed.

23:06.753 --> 23:10.354
It's my job, you
didn't ask for this.

23:11.824 --> 23:14.925
It's not just your job
though, is it, Dad?

23:16.596 --> 23:18.429
What do you mean?

23:18.865 --> 23:19.930
It's your life.

23:19.932 --> 23:22.566
You and your mother are my life.

23:22.568 --> 23:23.667
But we have to share you

23:23.669 --> 23:27.571
with all of the criminals in
this little part of the world.

23:27.974 --> 23:30.508
They get more of
your time than we do.

23:30.510 --> 23:35.346
I'm sorry, Deb, I'll try to
make more time for us.

23:37.216 --> 23:38.449
Okay.

23:39.352 --> 23:40.618
Okay.

23:52.565 --> 23:54.498
<i> He's been</i>
<i>called the Green River Killer</i>

23:54.500 --> 23:57.401
<i>ever since the first
bodies, five of them,</i>

23:57.403 --> 23:58.702
<i>were pulled from this river.</i>

23:58.704 --> 24:02.339
You know, this issue with the
press isn't gonna go away.

24:02.341 --> 24:04.375
I didn't have any
new information,

24:04.377 --> 24:07.311
there was no point
talking to them.

24:07.513 --> 24:09.580
But we did get
something new today.

24:09.582 --> 24:10.915
Nothing to leak
to the press yet,

24:10.917 --> 24:13.217
but it could change how
you deal with the media.

24:13.219 --> 24:16.520
The posing of the body
with the wine and the fish?

24:16.522 --> 24:17.321
Yeah.

24:17.323 --> 24:19.657
That wasn't part of
his modus operandi

24:19.659 --> 24:21.125
with previous victims.

24:21.127 --> 24:23.494
That was his way of
engaging with us,

24:23.496 --> 24:25.262
or, more to the point, you.

24:25.264 --> 24:28.466
It's like he's saying, "This
is my banquet, Detective."

24:28.468 --> 24:32.570
You really think he sat at
home watching the news reports?

24:32.572 --> 24:33.437
Of course.

24:33.439 --> 24:36.507
Narcissism is one of the
symptoms of psychopathy,

24:36.509 --> 24:37.975
that's the dichotomy.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.877
Damaged self-esteem
on the one hand,

24:39.879 --> 24:44.648
but also a grandiose sense of
self-importance on the other.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.350
In the killer's head,

24:46.486 --> 24:49.587
this murder spree may
be the ultimate game.

24:49.589 --> 24:51.155
Now you're his main opponent.

24:51.157 --> 24:54.592
Sun Tzu, the Chinese general
who wrote "The Art of War",

24:54.594 --> 24:58.863
he said, "If you're
far from your enemy,

24:59.065 --> 25:01.565
"make him believe you're near."

25:04.437 --> 25:06.437
Just something to keep in mind.

25:16.349 --> 25:19.583
As you know, we've
discovered another body.

25:19.585 --> 25:22.753
I won't be taking
any questions today,

25:22.755 --> 25:25.022
I just came to say one thing.

25:25.124 --> 25:28.192
I wanna talk directly
to the killer.

25:33.799 --> 25:35.799
I know you're out there,

25:36.469 --> 25:38.202
watching this,

25:38.638 --> 25:41.572
I don't need profilers
and psychiatrists

25:41.574 --> 25:45.676
to tell me you're a
sick son of a bitch.

25:45.678 --> 25:47.311
You're not even a man,

25:47.313 --> 25:50.548
I doubt you have the
equipment for it.

25:50.850 --> 25:52.449
<i>You're a demented pervert</i>

25:52.451 --> 25:54.418
<i>who doesn't deserve to
breathe the same air</i>

25:54.420 --> 25:58.222
<i>as the people you have
so callously murdered.</i>

25:59.058 --> 26:01.959
You are gutless, pathetic,

26:01.961 --> 26:03.060
and when your luck runs out,

26:03.062 --> 26:05.396
and make no mistake, it will,

26:05.398 --> 26:07.298
<i>I'll be right there
to take you down,</i>

26:07.300 --> 26:09.700
<i>you got that, you
piece of?</i>

26:09.702 --> 26:12.570
That's a promise from me to you.

26:14.941 --> 26:15.739
Thank you.

26:19.679 --> 26:20.544
Hey, slugger.

26:20.546 --> 26:21.712
How was school today?

26:21.714 --> 26:22.947
Good.

26:23.215 --> 26:24.281
He made you this.

26:24.283 --> 26:26.050
<i> ...Began in</i>
<i>the summer of 1982,</i>

26:26.052 --> 26:27.651
<i>and since then, an
army of detectives</i>

26:27.653 --> 26:29.853
<i>and a multimillion-dollar
computer system</i>

26:29.855 --> 26:31.922
<i>have been unable to
track the killer.</i>

26:31.924 --> 26:32.823
Thank you.

26:32.825 --> 26:34.558
<i>It is a familiar routine,</i>

26:34.560 --> 26:36.393
<i>for the Green River Task
Force sifting through</i>

26:36.395 --> 26:37.995
<i>any remaining
evidence on the site</i>

26:37.997 --> 26:41.865
<i>where someone had stumbled
across human remains.</i>

27:00.686 --> 27:02.853
Your office forwarded this.

27:04.857 --> 27:06.924
You haven't been demoted
to mailman already,

27:06.926 --> 27:07.891
have you, Tom?

27:07.893 --> 27:09.593
If we don't
catch this prick soon,

27:09.595 --> 27:10.995
maybe I will be.

27:24.543 --> 27:26.510
Oh my god.

27:29.849 --> 27:31.215
<i> Dearest Bob.</i>

27:31.217 --> 27:33.984
<i>It has been the better
part of two years</i>

27:33.986 --> 27:35.552
<i>since we've corresponded,</i>

27:35.554 --> 27:38.622
<i>and I must admit,
I've missed it.</i>

27:38.624 --> 27:40.190
<i>I've followed,
with great interest,</i>

27:40.192 --> 27:43.727
<i>the case of "The Riverman",
and see from the news reports</i>

27:43.729 --> 27:47.364
<i>that you are advising
the task force.</i>

27:47.366 --> 27:49.400
<i>I recently saw a press
conference</i>

27:49.402 --> 27:51.135
<i>with Detective Richards.</i>

27:51.137 --> 27:54.271
<i>Not the usual police
officer, is he?</i>

27:54.273 --> 27:57.775
<i>He seems to be taking
it quite personally.</i>

27:58.077 --> 27:59.176
<i>As you know,</i>

27:59.178 --> 28:04.348
<i>I have some experience in The
Riverman's field of expertise.</i>

28:04.350 --> 28:06.884
<i>I believe I can help you.</i>

28:07.086 --> 28:08.585
<i>If you have the
time to visit me,</i>

28:08.587 --> 28:12.389
<i>along with Detective
Richards, please do.</i>

28:12.725 --> 28:15.325
<i>Time for me is running out,</i>

28:15.327 --> 28:18.996
<i>I would like to make
use of what remains.</i>

28:18.998 --> 28:24.601
<i>Kind regards, your old
friend, Theodore Bundy.</i>

28:26.906 --> 28:29.373
David, your thoughts?

28:29.375 --> 28:32.242
Well, the key question is,

28:32.244 --> 28:34.845
could he actually help
the investigation,

28:34.847 --> 28:38.549
or would he be leading
us on some circle jerk

28:38.551 --> 28:40.417
for his own amusement?

28:40.753 --> 28:43.387
He has an agenda,
he always does.

28:43.389 --> 28:46.156
What's his agenda
here? To buy time?

28:46.158 --> 28:47.257
Yeah, I'd say so.

28:47.259 --> 28:50.961
Like he says in his letter,
time is running out for him.

28:50.963 --> 28:52.563
He'll do everything he can

28:52.565 --> 28:54.264
to court favor with
the authorities

28:54.266 --> 28:56.800
and get a reprieve
from execution.

28:58.204 --> 29:02.673
What's it like coming face to
face with someone like that?

29:02.675 --> 29:05.843
Maybe you need to
find out for yourself.

29:05.845 --> 29:06.844
At some point,

29:06.846 --> 29:09.012
you're gonna be face to face
with the Green River Killer.

29:09.014 --> 29:10.948
After you meet Ted Bundy,

29:10.950 --> 29:14.017
evil will no longer
be a mystery to you.

29:22.695 --> 29:23.894
What?

29:23.996 --> 29:27.131
Two days talking to
a madman in Florida?

29:27.133 --> 29:29.967
Don't you have enough
to deal with right now?

29:30.269 --> 29:32.336
It might be a complete
waste of time,

29:32.338 --> 29:36.673
or it could help with the
investigation, who knows,

29:36.675 --> 29:39.910
but we have no suspects yet,

29:39.912 --> 29:42.613
I have to try everything I can.

29:45.251 --> 29:48.051
I just worry about
you, that's all.

29:48.654 --> 29:50.320
It'll be fine.

29:51.457 --> 29:52.689
Come here.

30:06.071 --> 30:07.871
Where are you going?

30:08.007 --> 30:09.506
I've got a few errands to run.

30:09.508 --> 30:13.143
Well, you know you're
looking after Adam tonight.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.846
How come?

30:18.250 --> 30:22.986
I've got a dinner with
Amy and the girls.

30:25.491 --> 30:28.859
It's her birthday, I told
you about this weeks ago.

30:32.598 --> 30:34.364
What's the matter?

30:37.102 --> 30:39.236
What's the matter?

30:42.141 --> 30:44.341
I've got something
important to do.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.376
It's been playing
on my mind all week,

30:46.378 --> 30:49.446
I need to take
care of it tonight.

30:49.548 --> 30:53.283
Come on, Gary, I
had my plans first.

30:53.285 --> 30:54.351
If you have to leave the house,

30:54.353 --> 30:56.687
can't you take Adam with you?

31:08.434 --> 31:10.067
I guess so.

31:11.070 --> 31:12.369
Thank you.

31:14.573 --> 31:16.773
I'll be home around 11.

31:17.910 --> 31:19.142
Alright.

31:57.182 --> 31:58.849
Dad, where are we going?

31:58.851 --> 32:03.453
I gotta pick up a friend of
mine, drop her off somewhere.

32:37.990 --> 32:39.556
Hello, Bob.

32:40.559 --> 32:41.992
Ted.

32:57.242 --> 32:58.842
Long time no see.

33:00.045 --> 33:01.678
It's been a while.

33:02.748 --> 33:06.717
And this must be the
famous Detective Richards.

33:19.565 --> 33:22.866
As always, Ted, we'll
be recording this.

33:23.569 --> 33:24.935
Of course.

33:29.375 --> 33:33.877
It's the 2nd of September,
approximately 9:30 p.m.,

33:33.879 --> 33:35.912
at Florida State Prison.

33:35.981 --> 33:38.749
This is a tape-recorded
interview with Bob Keller,

33:38.751 --> 33:41.451
David Richards, and Ted Bundy.

33:42.354 --> 33:45.789
So, Ted, would
you like to begin?

33:46.091 --> 33:47.758
Well, this is just

33:47.760 --> 33:52.029
sort of a spontaneous
dialogue we're having here.

33:52.031 --> 33:55.999
I'm not approaching it
in any organized fashion.

33:56.168 --> 34:00.003
I don't even know if I can
be of any real assistance.

34:00.005 --> 34:01.972
You're the detectives after all.

34:01.974 --> 34:05.242
We'd value any
insights you may have.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.645
Well, did you bring a
copy of the case file?

34:08.647 --> 34:12.449
Um, I'm not sure it would
be ethical to give you--

34:12.451 --> 34:13.984
It's fine.

34:45.317 --> 34:48.952
The Riverman enjoys easy prey.

34:49.388 --> 34:50.554
The victims?

34:50.556 --> 34:51.353
Yes.

34:51.356 --> 34:54.224
Prostitutes are low risk.

34:54.226 --> 34:55.826
Not many people would miss them.

34:55.828 --> 34:59.496
Who would you consider
to be high-risk prey?

34:59.932 --> 35:02.265
Well, people who
work normal jobs,

35:02.267 --> 35:05.335
have families, social circles,

35:05.337 --> 35:07.537
people who are noticed.

35:09.041 --> 35:09.973
You know,

35:09.975 --> 35:11.942
with all the slasher movies
being made at the moment,

35:11.944 --> 35:15.612
you should stake out the car
parks of the movie theaters.

35:15.614 --> 35:19.382
I am sure you'd find many
serial killers of the future,

35:19.384 --> 35:23.487
people who go to those films
to fuel their fantasies.

35:23.722 --> 35:26.723
When I was a kid, I just
had the detective magazines.

35:26.725 --> 35:28.024
I don't think staking out

35:28.026 --> 35:30.594
thousands of movie
theaters is practical,

35:30.596 --> 35:32.195
given the limited
numbers of police

35:32.197 --> 35:34.364
we can assign to the case.

35:34.666 --> 35:35.565
Perhaps not.

35:35.567 --> 35:38.168
But you could stake
out his old dump sites.

35:38.170 --> 35:40.837
You mean where he
left the bodies?

35:40.839 --> 35:42.005
Yes.

35:42.007 --> 35:43.306
He'll return to them.

35:43.308 --> 35:46.042
He's going back to
check out the scene

35:46.044 --> 35:48.078
and see the
condition of the body

35:48.080 --> 35:49.446
after it's been
there for a while,

35:49.448 --> 35:54.784
for, uh, well, whatever kick
he might get out of that.

35:54.786 --> 35:56.153
Necrophilia?

35:56.321 --> 35:57.888
Look, what he's
doing is not normal,

35:57.890 --> 36:01.024
so you can't apply
normal standards to it.

36:01.026 --> 36:04.895
He might just drive by, see if
the scene is being disturbed,

36:04.897 --> 36:07.597
if the body has been discovered.

36:07.766 --> 36:09.166
Well, if it hasn't,

36:09.168 --> 36:12.335
well, he might wanna
take it all in again.

36:16.241 --> 36:20.544
Would he go back to a site
after we've discovered it?

36:20.679 --> 36:21.478
Oh, no.

36:21.480 --> 36:24.347
At that point, he wouldn't
touch it with a 10-mile pole.

36:24.950 --> 36:28.018
Why do you think
guys like him kill?

36:29.054 --> 36:33.089
Well, there's a certain
aspect of possessiveness

36:33.091 --> 36:34.891
in serial killing.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.960
I think that's one
way of describing it,

36:36.962 --> 36:38.195
well, in rather bland terms,

36:38.197 --> 36:40.931
but a possessiveness
where the corpse

36:40.933 --> 36:44.834
might easily be as important
as the live victim,

36:44.836 --> 36:47.137
in some respects.

36:47.139 --> 36:49.639
What I mean is,
a possessiveness,

36:49.641 --> 36:53.176
an ownership, a
taking, if you will,

36:53.178 --> 36:55.745
and that's part of the syndrome.

36:55.747 --> 36:57.447
And I think that's one
of the reasons why,

36:57.449 --> 36:59.749
in some cases, not
all, certainly,

36:59.751 --> 37:03.486
but he might be intending
to return to the scene,

37:03.488 --> 37:06.723
interact with the
body in some way.

37:08.994 --> 37:11.027
According to the time of death,

37:11.029 --> 37:14.130
all these murders
happened on a weekday.

37:14.132 --> 37:15.198
What does that tell you?

37:15.200 --> 37:17.968
Well, he obviously prefers
to troll on a weekday.

37:17.970 --> 37:21.071
He might have other
commitments of the weekend,

37:21.073 --> 37:23.406
people he's close to, perhaps.

37:23.408 --> 37:24.874
You think he has family?

37:24.876 --> 37:26.443
Oh, possibly.

37:28.113 --> 37:30.747
What'd you mean by "troll"?

37:30.949 --> 37:33.750
Well, it's what he does.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.285
Watching,

37:35.721 --> 37:36.786
waiting,

37:36.788 --> 37:38.655
selecting.

37:39.024 --> 37:41.358
He knows his hunting ground.

37:41.893 --> 37:42.792
Hey, Julie.

37:42.794 --> 37:44.394
Hey.

37:44.396 --> 37:45.328
This is my son.

37:45.330 --> 37:48.198
You remember, I showed you
a picture of him before.

37:49.001 --> 37:51.201
Oh, sure, yeah.

37:51.570 --> 37:54.337
So, what's the deal here?

37:54.339 --> 37:56.172
You want the kid to watch?

37:56.174 --> 37:57.907
'Cause I'm in to that.

37:58.076 --> 37:58.842
No.

37:58.844 --> 38:00.977
I didn't plan on
bringing him along,

38:00.979 --> 38:03.346
but his mother had to go out.

38:03.949 --> 38:05.815
I figured we'd go to the woods

38:05.817 --> 38:07.751
and he could wait in the car.

38:07.753 --> 38:09.152
I'll be quick.

38:09.521 --> 38:11.888
Sure, I remember.

38:13.625 --> 38:14.824
Get in.

38:14.893 --> 38:17.093
He targets his prey.

38:17.095 --> 38:20.263
He plans what he wants
to do in his mind,

38:20.265 --> 38:22.966
down to the smallest detail.

38:23.101 --> 38:24.234
By the time he closes in,

38:24.236 --> 38:27.537
it's almost like it's
already happened.

38:40.485 --> 38:41.851
Okay,

38:42.654 --> 38:44.521
this is far enough.

38:46.258 --> 38:47.857
You got the money?

38:57.035 --> 39:00.337
So, how do you wanna do this?

39:01.506 --> 39:05.241
That tree over
there, bend over it.

39:16.188 --> 39:19.989
<i> He's played it out in</i>
<i>his mind so many times.</i>

39:19.991 --> 39:21.658
<i>But when the time is right,</i>

39:21.660 --> 39:23.326
<i>and he swoops on his chosen one,</i>

39:23.328 --> 39:27.464
<i>well, then it's like
the spider and the fly.</i>

39:27.466 --> 39:30.734
<i>Fantasy finally becomes reality.</i>

39:30.736 --> 39:32.902
<i>And speaking of fantasy,</i>

39:32.904 --> 39:35.004
<i>well, that's what normality is.</i>

39:35.006 --> 39:37.273
<i>What's normal for the spider,</i>

39:37.275 --> 39:41.277
<i>well, it can seem
like chaos to the fly.</i>

40:48.914 --> 40:51.214
Did she get home okay?

40:53.018 --> 40:54.417
Yeah.

41:03.662 --> 41:06.029
Can you go there, Detective?

41:08.233 --> 41:09.032
Where?

41:09.034 --> 41:13.503
Inside his mind,
think like he thinks.

41:13.505 --> 41:15.538
I'm not sure I can.

41:16.274 --> 41:17.640
Oh, you can.

41:17.742 --> 41:22.912
We all have that coldblooded,
primal instinct within us.

41:23.048 --> 41:26.349
Whether you wanna
touch upon your own is...

41:26.585 --> 41:28.918
well, that's another story.

42:59.044 --> 42:59.909
Hello?

42:59.911 --> 43:01.945
<i> Dave, it's Tom.</i>

43:01.947 --> 43:02.979
What is it?

43:02.981 --> 43:04.681
<i>We've found another body.</i>

43:05.584 --> 43:06.783
Shit.

43:06.985 --> 43:09.552
I thought we had our guys
staking out the Green River?

43:09.554 --> 43:10.920
<i> We didn't find it there,</i>

43:10.922 --> 43:14.123
<i>this one was found in a
woodland near Long Avenue.</i>

43:14.125 --> 43:16.526
<i>Definitely him though, same M.O.</i>

43:16.528 --> 43:18.661
You tell the press yet?

43:18.663 --> 43:19.596
<i>No.</i>

43:19.598 --> 43:21.264
<i>I've only just ordered the
forensics team down there.</i>

43:21.266 --> 43:22.231
Call it off.

43:22.233 --> 43:24.534
<i>- What do you mean?</i>
- Tell the team to back off,

43:24.536 --> 43:27.170
leave the site just
as it was found.

43:27.172 --> 43:28.605
Don't tell the press,

43:28.607 --> 43:30.773
don't tell anyone
in the department

43:30.775 --> 43:31.908
who doesn't already know.

43:31.910 --> 43:35.545
Leave the body exactly
where it was found, Tom.

43:35.814 --> 43:37.146
<i>Why?</i>

43:37.148 --> 43:38.781
Bundy said the
killer will return

43:38.783 --> 43:41.017
to where he dumped the bodies.

43:41.019 --> 43:42.185
If you leave this body there

43:42.187 --> 43:43.820
and he doesn't see
anything on the news,

43:43.822 --> 43:46.322
he might think it's not
been discovered yet.

43:46.324 --> 43:48.658
Then he'll go back.

43:48.660 --> 43:51.094
That's when we'll be
staking out those woods.

43:51.096 --> 43:53.696
<i>Okay, I'll go
myself with Kavanagh.</i>

43:53.698 --> 43:55.465
No, no, I'll go with you,

43:55.467 --> 43:57.667
I'm heading to the
airport right now.

43:57.669 --> 44:00.670
I'll be back in a
few hours, yeah?

44:00.672 --> 44:01.804
<i>Got it.</i>

44:01.806 --> 44:03.006
Bye.

44:23.495 --> 44:25.395
Flying solo today, Bob?

44:25.397 --> 44:29.732
Detective Richards had to
travel back to the Green River.

44:29.734 --> 44:32.435
Have they found another body?

44:37.342 --> 44:42.111
Well, I hope the information
I gave yesterday was helpful.

44:42.113 --> 44:43.079
It was.

44:43.081 --> 44:45.415
And since you're
in a helpful mood,

44:45.417 --> 44:49.185
I thought today we could
discuss a different subject.

44:49.187 --> 44:50.953
What's that?

44:50.955 --> 44:52.588
You know, Ted,

44:52.657 --> 44:55.558
there are still five cases
we're concerned about,

44:55.560 --> 44:59.629
missing girls,
Washington and Utah.

45:00.932 --> 45:02.298
Okay.

45:02.300 --> 45:06.469
Well, maybe we can
talk about that.

45:06.938 --> 45:08.638
I guess it depends.

45:08.640 --> 45:09.405
On what?

45:09.407 --> 45:12.375
Did you speak to the
attorney general?

45:12.811 --> 45:14.210
I spoke to him last night.

45:14.212 --> 45:17.914
I told him you'd been
receptive to our questioning.

45:17.916 --> 45:19.549
But truth be told, Ted,

45:19.551 --> 45:21.951
he knows there are a lot
of families out there

45:21.953 --> 45:23.886
that need closure.

45:23.955 --> 45:26.322
But before we get down to that,

45:26.324 --> 45:29.659
has the attorney general
discussed in firm terms

45:29.661 --> 45:35.164
what the outcome of these
conversations could be for me?

45:35.333 --> 45:38.334
He said any information
you can provide

45:38.336 --> 45:40.503
which can give the
families closure

45:40.505 --> 45:43.139
will be given the
greatest consideration

45:43.141 --> 45:44.340
when discussions take place

45:44.342 --> 45:47.744
about the implementation
of the death penalty.

45:48.313 --> 45:50.179
Okay.

45:50.181 --> 45:51.447
Good.

45:52.016 --> 45:54.650
Well, I'm sure you know, Bob,

45:54.652 --> 45:57.754
it all began in
Washington state.

45:58.156 --> 45:59.288
That's where I was living,

45:59.290 --> 46:02.492
where I grew up as a
kid and a young man,

46:02.494 --> 46:04.260
where those kinds of impulses

46:04.262 --> 46:09.398
which ultimately led to the
violent behavior were born.

46:09.400 --> 46:10.600
Yeah.

46:12.036 --> 46:15.304
This is where I'm
a little, um...

46:15.440 --> 46:18.307
The presence of the
officer down here,

46:18.309 --> 46:21.344
well, it's a little unnerving.

46:21.346 --> 46:24.514
Some of this stuff I don't
mind talking about because,

46:24.516 --> 46:27.683
well, he wouldn't know
it from Adam, but,

46:28.520 --> 46:30.219
well, I can write it down,

46:30.221 --> 46:33.823
or whisper it to you, whatever.

46:36.294 --> 46:37.560
Okay.

46:55.346 --> 46:57.380
Can you hear that?

46:59.184 --> 47:00.783
Yeah, I can hear it.

47:00.919 --> 47:06.022
I just wrote down the
name Joanne Dawkins.

47:07.225 --> 47:08.424
So...

47:09.260 --> 47:13.262
the Dawkins girl's
head was severed

47:14.199 --> 47:19.035
and taken up the road
about 25-50 yards

47:19.037 --> 47:21.804
and then buried in a location

47:21.806 --> 47:24.740
about 10 yards west of the road

47:24.742 --> 47:29.011
on a rocky hillside
in Washington.

47:32.550 --> 47:34.350
Did you hear that?

47:35.019 --> 47:36.285
Yeah.

47:39.023 --> 47:42.992
Lord knows what the little
creatures up there did to it,

47:42.994 --> 47:45.895
what those animals
would have done.

47:45.964 --> 47:48.531
Well, I can draw you a map
to where you can find it,

47:48.533 --> 47:49.398
if you like.

47:49.400 --> 47:52.001
Thank you, that
would be helpful.

47:52.003 --> 47:55.872
But first, how did
you encounter her?

47:56.007 --> 47:59.408
Oh, I was making my
way up an alleyway,

47:59.410 --> 48:03.246
with my briefcase,
using crutches,

48:03.548 --> 48:06.749
and a young woman
was walking down.

48:07.085 --> 48:10.253
I saw her walk around the
north end of the block

48:10.255 --> 48:12.421
and into the alleyway.

48:12.891 --> 48:13.923
She stopped for a moment

48:13.925 --> 48:17.493
and then kept on
walking down toward me.

48:17.929 --> 48:18.961
About halfway,

48:18.963 --> 48:20.763
I encountered her

48:20.832 --> 48:23.933
and asked if she'd help
carry my briefcase,

48:23.935 --> 48:25.401
which she did,

48:25.403 --> 48:29.071
and we went back
up the alleyway.

48:29.307 --> 48:31.540
Across the street,
we turned right,

48:31.542 --> 48:36.579
on the sidewalk outside the
old fraternity house there.

48:36.581 --> 48:38.481
We rounded the
corner on the left

48:38.483 --> 48:41.050
and headed north on 47.

48:41.052 --> 48:42.418
About halfway up the block,

48:42.420 --> 48:44.420
there used to be
this old parking lot,

48:44.422 --> 48:49.125
which they'd made out of the
burned-out buildings there.

48:49.627 --> 48:52.094
So what happened when
you rounded the corner?

48:52.096 --> 48:54.463
Oh, we went into
the parking lot.

48:54.465 --> 48:55.598
When we reached my car,

48:55.600 --> 48:58.801
I knocked her unconscious
with a crowbar.

48:58.803 --> 49:00.336
Where'd you have that stashed?

49:00.338 --> 49:03.806
Hidden behind the
rear wheel of the car.

49:04.342 --> 49:05.474
Did she see it?

49:05.476 --> 49:06.442
No.

49:06.444 --> 49:10.513
There were some handcuffs
along with the crowbar.

49:10.515 --> 49:15.051
I handcuffed her, put her in
the passenger side of the car,

49:15.653 --> 49:17.153
and drove away.

49:40.378 --> 49:41.844
Dave.

49:43.281 --> 49:44.981
Over there.

49:51.489 --> 49:52.989
Wait.

49:57.395 --> 49:58.561
Wait.

50:04.535 --> 50:05.835
Let's go.

50:07.405 --> 50:08.904
Don't fucking move!

51:25.450 --> 51:26.782
Put the fucking gun down now!

51:26.784 --> 51:29.418
Now put your hands on
your head and back away!

51:30.354 --> 51:35.991
Freeze!

51:35.993 --> 51:39.562
Society wants to
believe it can identify

51:39.564 --> 51:43.432
bad or harmful individuals,

51:44.001 --> 51:45.968
but it's not practical.

51:45.970 --> 51:49.472
The truth is, people who
indulge in this sort of thing,

51:49.474 --> 51:53.976
well, they look just
like everyone else.

51:53.978 --> 51:57.446
Their subconscious might
be a raging inferno,

51:57.448 --> 52:02.118
but you'd never tell,
they blend in so well.

52:02.787 --> 52:06.188
This is what it
comes down to, Bob,

52:06.357 --> 52:09.191
we serial killers,

52:09.460 --> 52:11.894
we're your sons,

52:11.896 --> 52:14.063
your husbands,

52:14.565 --> 52:16.465
we're everywhere,

52:17.335 --> 52:23.572
and there will be more of
your children dead tomorrow.

52:27.178 --> 52:29.545
<i> All of</i>
<i>us on this earth</i>

52:29.547 --> 52:32.381
<i>know that there
is a time to live</i>

52:32.383 --> 52:34.650
<i>and that there is a time to die,</i>

52:34.652 --> 52:39.288
<i>yet death is always a
shock to those left behind.</i>

52:42.760 --> 52:45.161
Jesus, Dad, you scared me.

52:45.163 --> 52:48.063
I didn't realize
anyone else was up.

52:48.065 --> 52:49.398
Sorry.

52:49.400 --> 52:51.333
Struggling to sleep?

52:52.069 --> 52:52.868
Yeah.

52:52.870 --> 52:54.703
I have a big test
at school tomorrow,

52:54.705 --> 52:57.773
and no matter how
hard I hit the books,

52:57.775 --> 52:59.909
I just, I don't feel prepared.

52:59.911 --> 53:03.012
You'll do great, you always do.

53:14.625 --> 53:16.792
Hey, take a seat,

53:17.562 --> 53:19.128
watch some TV.

53:24.902 --> 53:26.135
<i> The funeral over,</i>

53:26.137 --> 53:29.405
<i>the saddened group
left the graveside.</i>

53:39.717 --> 53:43.953
Deb, you know I
love you, don't you?

53:44.021 --> 53:47.923
Sure, Dad, I
know, I love you too.

53:47.925 --> 53:51.060
I'm very proud of you,
you know that, right?

53:51.062 --> 53:53.829
You got some
whiskey in that cup?

53:54.098 --> 53:56.265
No, it's just tea.

53:56.701 --> 53:59.768
Then what's with all
the declarations?

54:02.106 --> 54:04.740
I just want you to know
how much you mean to me,

54:04.742 --> 54:06.075
that's all.

54:07.945 --> 54:09.578
You're sweet, Dad.

54:10.681 --> 54:13.249
But I better get back to bed,

54:13.317 --> 54:15.150
see if I can get some sleep.

54:15.152 --> 54:16.919
Okay, sweetheart.

54:16.921 --> 54:17.686
Goodnight.

54:17.688 --> 54:20.189
Goodnight.

54:33.104 --> 54:35.271
Where were you on June 17th?

54:36.974 --> 54:39.775
I had to take my
truck to the shop.

54:40.645 --> 54:44.113
Have you ever cruised
the SeaTac strip?

54:44.115 --> 54:47.149
I'm, I'm not familiar
with that place.

54:47.551 --> 54:49.918
<i> His name is Gary</i>
<i>Ridgway.</i>

54:49.920 --> 54:51.720
<i>He was picked up for
attempting to solicit</i>

54:51.722 --> 54:56.892
<i>an undercover police officer
posing as a prostitute in May.</i>

54:56.894 --> 54:59.361
<i>Tom got a hunch
and ran his record.</i>

54:59.363 --> 55:02.931
He was accused of choking
a prostitute in 1980,

55:02.933 --> 55:04.466
near the SeaTac strip.

55:04.468 --> 55:06.635
At the time, he
pleaded self-defense,

55:06.637 --> 55:10.839
after claiming the woman bit
him, and he got released.

55:10.841 --> 55:14.009
<i>One of our officers stopped and
questioned Ridgway last year</i>

55:14.011 --> 55:17.546
<i>while he was in his
truck with a prostitute.</i>

55:18.015 --> 55:19.281
They also approached this guy

55:19.283 --> 55:23.352
in connection with the
kidnapping of Marie Olsen.

55:23.554 --> 55:24.553
Ridgway was questioned,

55:24.555 --> 55:27.056
but not enough evidence
to make an arrest.

55:27.058 --> 55:30.259
Has anyone questioned the
sex workers on the strip?

55:30.261 --> 55:32.161
Several prostitutes saw a man

55:32.163 --> 55:33.429
matching Ridgway's description

55:33.431 --> 55:36.799
regularly cruising the
strip in the past two years.

55:36.801 --> 55:41.337
<i>Now he works at that
factory down in Bellevue,</i>

55:41.339 --> 55:42.404
<i>painting trucks,</i>

55:42.406 --> 55:44.573
<i>so he would pass that
strip almost daily</i>

55:44.575 --> 55:46.575
<i>on his way to and from work.</i>

55:46.577 --> 55:48.243
Sarah Edgar.

55:48.846 --> 55:51.280
I've never heard of her.

55:51.649 --> 55:53.115
So what's your next move?

55:53.117 --> 55:56.018
I think we should get him
to take a polygraph test.

55:56.020 --> 55:59.855
You know those things can't
be considered 100% accurate.

55:59.857 --> 56:00.789
Yeah, I know,

56:00.791 --> 56:03.292
but I need something
more than circumstantial

56:03.294 --> 56:04.660
if I'm gonna convince the chief

56:04.662 --> 56:07.162
there's a case to be made here.

56:07.231 --> 56:09.698
Do you think he's the killer?

56:10.401 --> 56:13.869
Something in my
gut tells me he is.

56:14.772 --> 56:17.239
Then do what you have to do.

56:24.548 --> 56:27.483
Is your name
Gary Leon Ridgway?

56:27.918 --> 56:29.251
Yes.

56:31.222 --> 56:34.790
Have you ever
cruised the SeaTac strip?

56:34.792 --> 56:36.058
No.

56:36.127 --> 56:39.428
Have you ever
hired a prostitute?

56:39.430 --> 56:40.896
No.

56:46.103 --> 56:49.071
Did you know Julie Kakova?

56:49.273 --> 56:50.406
No.

56:54.745 --> 56:56.912
Did you kill her?

56:57.348 --> 56:58.514
No.

57:05.923 --> 57:06.855
He passed.

57:06.857 --> 57:08.924
He fucking passed.

57:09.794 --> 57:10.859
Ridgway?

57:10.861 --> 57:11.994
Yeah.

57:13.197 --> 57:15.063
You know we got nothing
on this guy now.

57:15.065 --> 57:18.634
We executed a search warrant
on his home, turned up nothing.

57:18.636 --> 57:20.936
The forensics team
test this guy?

57:20.938 --> 57:22.237
They took everything from him,

57:22.239 --> 57:24.573
saliva, piss, the whole shebang.

57:24.575 --> 57:25.674
There's nothing conclusive

57:25.676 --> 57:27.409
to link him to any
of the crime scenes.

57:27.411 --> 57:28.644
Shit.

57:30.514 --> 57:32.314
We gotta let him go.

58:40.317 --> 58:41.650
There have been
several suspects,

58:41.652 --> 58:44.653
but a case can't be
made against any of 'em.

58:44.655 --> 58:48.557
$15 million of
public funds spent.

58:48.626 --> 58:52.761
As of today, the Green River
Task Force will be dismantled.

58:52.763 --> 58:56.298
We simply can't continue
spending this kinda money

58:56.300 --> 58:57.699
and allocating
this much manpower

58:57.701 --> 59:01.470
to an investigation which
has yielded no results.

59:01.572 --> 59:06.141
I know you were expecting
this, and I hope you accept it.

59:06.677 --> 59:08.043
It's over, Dave.

59:09.480 --> 59:11.480
Respectfully, sir,

59:12.883 --> 59:14.950
it'll never be over.

59:17.855 --> 59:20.055
A sad
and ugly chapter

59:20.057 --> 59:21.390
<i>will end tomorrow morning</i>

59:21.392 --> 59:24.192
<i>as notorious serial
killer Ted Bundy</i>

59:24.194 --> 59:27.529
<i>is set to die in
Florida's electric chair.</i>

59:27.531 --> 59:29.264
<i>Officially, Bundy's
execution will be for</i>

59:29.266 --> 59:33.302
<i>the kidnap and murder of
12-year-old Caroline Keach,</i>

59:33.304 --> 59:38.106
<i>but he was also found guilty
of two additional 1978 slayings</i>

59:38.108 --> 59:42.678
<i>and is suspected in
20-40 other homicides,</i>

59:42.680 --> 59:43.812
<i>at least 23 of which</i>

59:43.814 --> 59:45.514
<i>he has confessed to law
enforcement officials</i>

59:45.516 --> 59:48.350
<i>in the past few years.
Faced with execution</i>

59:48.352 --> 59:51.086
<i>after nearly a decade
of court appeals,</i>

59:51.088 --> 59:54.823
<i>Bundy has attempted to
trade confessions for time</i>

59:54.825 --> 59:55.891
<i>to give lawmen details</i>

59:55.893 --> 59:57.426
<i>of all of the murders.</i>

59:57.428 --> 01:00:00.562
<i>The Florida governor refused
to make such a trade.</i>

01:00:00.564 --> 01:00:05.100
<i>Bundy is scheduled to
be executed at 7:00 a.m.</i>

01:00:11.442 --> 01:00:13.208
Bob.

01:00:13.877 --> 01:00:15.043
Ted.

01:00:16.313 --> 01:00:18.981
You know, I could still
provide information.

01:00:18.983 --> 01:00:22.784
I've remembered things that
might help the families.

01:00:22.786 --> 01:00:24.653
I know you're hoping
for a phone call,

01:00:24.655 --> 01:00:27.990
but I don't think it'll come.

01:00:28.892 --> 01:00:32.561
Many feel justice is
being served tomorrow.

01:00:33.864 --> 01:00:35.230
What about you, Bob?

01:00:35.232 --> 01:00:38.634
Do you think justice
is being served?

01:00:39.703 --> 01:00:42.471
I'm not here to
pass judgment, Ted.

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.474
Well, then why are you here?

01:00:45.542 --> 01:00:48.710
I'm interested in your
thoughts on something.

01:00:49.947 --> 01:00:51.480
What's that?

01:00:53.517 --> 01:00:55.651
Why'd you go down this road?

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.186
Well, everyone asks that.

01:00:58.188 --> 01:01:02.424
Yeah, but you never really
answered it before, have you?

01:01:03.594 --> 01:01:05.193
What's the point?

01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:09.531
Help people understand perhaps.

01:01:09.667 --> 01:01:12.768
Maybe I can give you
a little insight too.

01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:13.769
Maybe the truth is

01:01:13.771 --> 01:01:17.673
I don't have an answer
to your question.

01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:20.308
Whenever I'm interviewed,

01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:24.413
people always ask, do I feel
guilt for what I've done?

01:01:25.449 --> 01:01:26.581
Guilt...

01:01:28.152 --> 01:01:29.751
it's an illusion,

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:33.321
a mechanism of social control.

01:01:33.323 --> 01:01:37.726
It's very unhealthy, does
terrible things to the body.

01:01:38.896 --> 01:01:41.229
What about when you
were young, Ted?

01:01:41.231 --> 01:01:44.066
What was your emotional
state of mind?

01:01:44.702 --> 01:01:45.967
Confusion.

01:01:46.437 --> 01:01:51.073
I could never understand what
made people want to be friends,

01:01:51.075 --> 01:01:54.543
or what made people
attracted to one another,

01:01:54.545 --> 01:01:59.948
or what underlays
social interactions.

01:02:00.617 --> 01:02:02.584
I'd watch people

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.754
and see them feel,

01:02:07.491 --> 01:02:11.426
but, I don't know, I
could never be like them.

01:02:11.428 --> 01:02:16.231
Do you remember the first
time you felt the urges?

01:02:16.967 --> 01:02:18.967
I certainly fantasized.

01:02:18.969 --> 01:02:22.904
Well, as a young
boy of 12 or 13,

01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:26.141
I'd encountered
soft-core pornography,

01:02:26.143 --> 01:02:31.413
outside the home, local
drug or grocery stores.

01:02:31.749 --> 01:02:32.748
Young boys,

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:37.686
they explore the sideways and
byways of their neighborhood.

01:02:37.788 --> 01:02:41.823
And in our neighborhood, people
would dump their garbage,

01:02:41.825 --> 01:02:43.325
and from time to time,

01:02:43.327 --> 01:02:45.427
we'd come across books

01:02:45.429 --> 01:02:49.531
of a more graphic nature,

01:02:49.533 --> 01:02:52.968
detective magazines and so on.

01:02:53.303 --> 01:02:54.936
Well, I wanna emphasize this,

01:02:54.938 --> 01:02:58.340
the most damaging
kind of pornography,

01:02:58.342 --> 01:03:01.243
I'm talking from real
personal experience here,

01:03:01.245 --> 01:03:07.649
is the kind which involves
violence and sexual violence.

01:03:07.885 --> 01:03:10.118
The wedding of those two forces,

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:13.355
as I know only too well,

01:03:13.357 --> 01:03:14.556
well, it brings about behavior

01:03:14.558 --> 01:03:17.826
that is too terrible
to describe.

01:03:18.095 --> 01:03:20.829
When did fantasy
become a reality?

01:03:22.166 --> 01:03:23.031
As a teen,

01:03:23.033 --> 01:03:25.967
I was dealing with
very strong inhibitions

01:03:25.969 --> 01:03:29.237
against violent and
criminal behavior

01:03:29.239 --> 01:03:31.206
that had been conditioned

01:03:31.208 --> 01:03:34.209
and bred into me
by my environment,

01:03:34.211 --> 01:03:38.814
the neighborhood,
schools, church.

01:03:39.283 --> 01:03:43.518
It's a very difficult
thing to describe,

01:03:43.687 --> 01:03:46.521
the sensation of
reaching a point

01:03:46.523 --> 01:03:52.327
where I knew I couldn't
control it anymore.

01:03:52.529 --> 01:03:56.565
The barriers I had
learned as a child

01:03:56.567 --> 01:03:58.433
were not enough to hold me back

01:03:58.435 --> 01:04:02.871
from seeking out and
harming somebody.

01:04:04.007 --> 01:04:08.577
How did you feel the first
time you committed a murder?

01:04:08.812 --> 01:04:14.282
Even all these years later,
it's difficult to talk about.

01:04:14.284 --> 01:04:16.384
Reliving it through talking is,

01:04:16.386 --> 01:04:17.786
well, difficult,
to say the least,

01:04:17.788 --> 01:04:21.790
but I want you to
understand what happened.

01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:27.028
It was like coming out of some

01:04:27.965 --> 01:04:32.100
horrible trance or dream.

01:04:32.469 --> 01:04:35.103
I can only liken it
to being possessed

01:04:35.105 --> 01:04:39.107
by something so awful and alien,

01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:40.242
and then the next morning,

01:04:40.244 --> 01:04:41.810
waking up and remembering
what happened,

01:04:41.812 --> 01:04:45.580
and realizing that, well,
in the eyes of the law,

01:04:45.582 --> 01:04:48.216
and certainly in
the eyes of God,

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:50.485
you're responsible.

01:04:51.088 --> 01:04:55.156
Possession is an
interesting word.

01:04:55.158 --> 01:04:59.327
What I did, it was like
possessing them, physically,

01:04:59.329 --> 01:05:03.798
as one might possess
a potted plant,

01:05:04.501 --> 01:05:06.268
or a painting,

01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:08.470
or a horse,

01:05:08.472 --> 01:05:12.774
owning, as it were, this person,

01:05:12.976 --> 01:05:18.413
and then taking
ownership of the remains.

01:05:19.116 --> 01:05:21.950
But when I'd wake
up in the morning

01:05:22.686 --> 01:05:25.787
and realize what I'd
done with a clear mind,

01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:31.960
with all my essential ethical
and moral feelings intact,

01:05:32.763 --> 01:05:35.997
well, it absolutely
horrified me.

01:05:37.467 --> 01:05:40.669
The feelings of pleasure
derived from what you did

01:05:40.671 --> 01:05:43.872
clearly outweighed any
feelings of being horrified,

01:05:43.874 --> 01:05:46.474
because you repeated it so much.

01:05:48.011 --> 01:05:48.877
Maybe so.

01:05:48.879 --> 01:05:51.746
Also, when you compare
people to possessions,

01:05:51.748 --> 01:05:56.284
well, I think it's hard to
believe that you felt anything,

01:05:56.286 --> 01:05:57.686
certainly if in your mind,

01:05:57.688 --> 01:06:00.956
people are no different
to material things.

01:06:03.961 --> 01:06:05.927
What's your point, Bob?

01:06:06.196 --> 01:06:08.229
I've spoken to your family,

01:06:08.231 --> 01:06:09.364
quite in depth, actually,

01:06:09.366 --> 01:06:11.666
and they were very candid.

01:06:11.735 --> 01:06:12.968
I don't know if you know this,

01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:15.570
but your aunt has a very
interesting memory of you

01:06:15.572 --> 01:06:17.939
from when you were
three years old.

01:06:17.941 --> 01:06:19.207
And what's that?

01:06:19.209 --> 01:06:22.444
She recalled waking
up from a nap one day

01:06:22.446 --> 01:06:23.678
at your grandparents' house

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:27.749
to find herself surrounded
by knives from the kitchen.

01:06:27.751 --> 01:06:32.954
You were stood by your
aunt's bed, smiling.

01:06:32.956 --> 01:06:35.357
Well, I can't
say I remember that, Bob,

01:06:35.359 --> 01:06:38.293
so I'll have to take
her word for it.

01:06:38.295 --> 01:06:41.529
If it's true, it's very
telling, don't you think?

01:06:41.531 --> 01:06:42.530
How so?

01:06:42.532 --> 01:06:44.899
Well, in my line of work,

01:06:44.901 --> 01:06:45.800
I'm always asked

01:06:45.802 --> 01:06:49.037
"is serial killing down
to nature or nurture?"

01:06:49.272 --> 01:06:50.438
That incident with your aunt

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.607
would suggest it's
down to nature,

01:06:52.609 --> 01:06:55.810
that you were born with
a darkness inside of you.

01:06:55.812 --> 01:06:57.545
But the thing is this,

01:06:57.547 --> 01:06:59.514
there are many people out there

01:06:59.516 --> 01:07:02.217
who are born with
darkness inside of them,

01:07:02.219 --> 01:07:04.719
there are many people
who suffer violence

01:07:04.721 --> 01:07:07.655
or have terrible things
happen to them as kids,

01:07:07.657 --> 01:07:11.159
but they don't all grow
up to be serial killers.

01:07:11.228 --> 01:07:15.030
Is this going somewhere, Bob?

01:07:15.799 --> 01:07:19.267
It's like the parable
of the two wolves.

01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:21.236
And what's that?

01:07:21.238 --> 01:07:23.138
A father is talking to his son,

01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:27.242
and he says there are
two wolves inside of us,

01:07:27.244 --> 01:07:28.810
always at battle.

01:07:28.812 --> 01:07:32.280
The good wolf represents
things like kindness,

01:07:32.282 --> 01:07:33.415
bravery, and love.

01:07:33.417 --> 01:07:38.553
The bad wolf represents things
like greed, hatred, and fear.

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:41.823
The son stops and thinks
about it for a second,

01:07:41.825 --> 01:07:44.959
and then looks at
his father and says,

01:07:44.961 --> 01:07:46.728
"Which one wins?"

01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:52.834
And the father quietly
replies, "The one we feed."

01:07:56.006 --> 01:08:00.241
And I guess you think I
fed the bad wolf, right?

01:08:00.477 --> 01:08:01.476
Yeah.

01:08:01.478 --> 01:08:02.577
Is it nature or nurture?

01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:05.814
A little of both for sure,
but the bottom line is this,

01:08:05.816 --> 01:08:10.151
we all have a choice about
the person we become.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:13.354
We create our own reality.

01:08:17.694 --> 01:08:21.362
<i> Ted Bundy, the</i>
<i>notorious serial killer,</i>

01:08:21.363 --> 01:08:23.398
<i>died today in the electric chair</i>

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:26.533
<i>after a night of
weeping and praying.</i>

01:08:51.261 --> 01:08:53.361
Let me do that.

01:08:54.831 --> 01:08:55.997
So,

01:08:56.166 --> 01:09:00.001
your first press conference
as the new chief.

01:09:00.937 --> 01:09:01.836
You nervous?

01:09:01.837 --> 01:09:04.404
Almost 20 years of
dealing with the press,

01:09:04.407 --> 01:09:06.174
you get used to it.

01:09:06.443 --> 01:09:07.475
I'm proud of you.

01:09:07.477 --> 01:09:10.145
You deserve this, and
you've worked hard for it.

01:09:10.147 --> 01:09:11.779
I couldn't have
done it without you.

01:09:11.781 --> 01:09:15.550
Mm, behind every great
man is a great woman.

01:09:15.551 --> 01:09:17.484
I know it's a cliche,

01:09:17.487 --> 01:09:19.154
but it's true.

01:09:20.524 --> 01:09:21.956
We're a team.

01:09:21.957 --> 01:09:25.326
This isn't just my
achievement, it's ours.

01:09:26.062 --> 01:09:28.196
Can I confess something?

01:09:28.798 --> 01:09:29.997
Yeah.

01:09:31.535 --> 01:09:33.001
I'm relieved.

01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:33.768
You are?

01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:36.638
Mm-hmm, a desk job gets
you off the streets,

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:39.541
which means I'm gonna
sleep better at night

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:42.042
knowing you'll be safe.

01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:48.649
What's wrong?

01:09:48.652 --> 01:09:50.084
Nothing.

01:09:51.121 --> 01:09:51.986
There you go.

01:09:51.988 --> 01:09:53.388
Thanks, honey.

01:10:13.777 --> 01:10:17.478
You've faced much
criticism over the years

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:22.283
for your failure to apprehend
the Green River Killer,

01:10:22.285 --> 01:10:26.921
how do you think the
victims' families might feel

01:10:26.923 --> 01:10:31.159
watching your career go
from strength to strength

01:10:31.161 --> 01:10:34.329
while the person who
murdered their daughters

01:10:34.331 --> 01:10:36.164
is still at large?

01:10:36.766 --> 01:10:37.999
Yes,

01:10:38.001 --> 01:10:42.770
I've spent almost two
decades haunted by this.

01:10:42.906 --> 01:10:46.074
My career has progressed, yes,

01:10:46.243 --> 01:10:49.010
but it hasn't stopped
the nightmares.

01:10:49.012 --> 01:10:55.416
My arrest and conviction rate
is the highest on the force,

01:10:55.752 --> 01:10:57.285
but there is not a day goes by

01:10:57.287 --> 01:11:01.789
when I don't think about
the one that got away

01:11:02.459 --> 01:11:04.993
and all the pain he caused.

01:11:07.764 --> 01:11:09.831
Which is why today,

01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:11.933
I am announcing

01:11:11.935 --> 01:11:15.069
that I will be reforming
the Green River Task Force.

01:11:17.507 --> 01:11:20.174
Considerable resources
will be diverted

01:11:20.176 --> 01:11:21.643
to resuming the investigation,

01:11:21.645 --> 01:11:24.912
and I will be personally
overseeing it.

01:11:24.914 --> 01:11:28.983
I want the victims'
families to know one thing,

01:11:29.052 --> 01:11:33.521
I will not rest until the
killer is behind bars.

01:11:47.604 --> 01:11:49.537
You saw the conference on TV?

01:11:49.539 --> 01:11:50.672
I did.

01:11:50.774 --> 01:11:53.574
I know you wanted
me to play it safe

01:11:53.576 --> 01:11:54.976
and stay behind a desk,

01:11:54.978 --> 01:11:59.180
but I just can't
let this one go.

01:11:59.683 --> 01:12:05.620
You gave years to this,
I saw what it did to you,

01:12:05.622 --> 01:12:06.554
I'm worried.

01:12:06.556 --> 01:12:08.156
I just gotta get back out there

01:12:08.158 --> 01:12:09.857
and nail that son of a bitch.

01:12:09.859 --> 01:12:11.059
And you think if you find him,

01:12:11.061 --> 01:12:13.828
you're gonna not
be haunted anymore?

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:17.932
I don't know, but this
isn't just about me.

01:12:17.934 --> 01:12:21.169
You gave your life
to public service,

01:12:21.171 --> 01:12:24.205
you don't owe anyone anything.

01:12:26.209 --> 01:12:31.879
If we'd have lost Deb, you'd
want justice, wouldn't you?

01:12:31.881 --> 01:12:33.314
Yes, of course,

01:12:33.316 --> 01:12:38.119
but you being a martyr
doesn't do anyone any favors.

01:12:38.121 --> 01:12:41.522
When the case was active,
you were here physically,

01:12:41.524 --> 01:12:43.925
but your mind was miles away.

01:12:43.927 --> 01:12:45.293
Is it a good thing for you

01:12:45.295 --> 01:12:46.961
to fight for other
people's families

01:12:46.963 --> 01:12:48.763
when your own has
to suffer for it?

01:12:48.765 --> 01:12:52.967
You know I love you, but
this is how I was made,

01:12:52.969 --> 01:12:55.269
this is what you married.

01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:58.840
Well, if you've
made up your mind,

01:12:58.842 --> 01:13:03.778
I guess there's nothing
else for me to say.

01:13:07.751 --> 01:13:09.550
Well, do you support me?

01:13:10.687 --> 01:13:12.954
I can't do this without you.

01:13:15.058 --> 01:13:19.093
I'll always be by your
side, you know that.

01:13:19.829 --> 01:13:21.162
And I hope when
you find this guy,

01:13:21.164 --> 01:13:25.833
you get the inner peace
that you're seeking.

01:13:40.450 --> 01:13:42.350
One of the victims,
Marsha Intola,

01:13:42.352 --> 01:13:45.853
the one who was posed with
the fish and the wine...

01:13:45.855 --> 01:13:46.654
Yeah?

01:13:46.656 --> 01:13:49.123
She was stripped
naked like the others,

01:13:49.125 --> 01:13:50.958
but there was a
dress found nearby

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.194
which was identified as hers.

01:13:53.196 --> 01:13:55.363
There was a semen sample
taken from the dress.

01:13:55.365 --> 01:13:59.333
We also recovered semen
from several of the victims.

01:13:59.335 --> 01:14:02.236
I know we established
many years back

01:14:02.238 --> 01:14:04.939
that the samples were
all from the same man,

01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:07.408
we just did not
have the technology

01:14:07.410 --> 01:14:09.944
for a more detailed DNA profile.

01:14:09.946 --> 01:14:12.113
So what can we do now?

01:14:12.115 --> 01:14:15.516
Our advances mean that the
sample from the discarded dress

01:14:15.518 --> 01:14:18.219
will stand strong
against the suspects

01:14:18.221 --> 01:14:19.454
we have on our database.

01:14:19.456 --> 01:14:21.889
We should also be
able to get matches

01:14:21.891 --> 01:14:26.394
on the semen samples retrieved
from the other victims.

01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:28.396
Okay.

01:14:28.832 --> 01:14:30.331
Let's get it done.

01:14:44.681 --> 01:14:46.280
These are the results?

01:14:46.549 --> 01:14:47.682
The same guy's DNA matches

01:14:47.684 --> 01:14:50.451
every sample recovered
from the victims.

01:14:50.553 --> 01:14:53.554
I don't even need to open this.

01:14:55.959 --> 01:14:58.459
It's Gary Ridgway, isn't it?

01:15:17.714 --> 01:15:19.514
Let's go get him.

01:15:47.076 --> 01:15:48.776
Put your hands
in the air.

01:15:48.778 --> 01:15:53.281
One false move and I'll put
two in the back of your head.

01:15:53.283 --> 01:15:56.551
Slowly, put your hands
behind your back.

01:16:03.893 --> 01:16:05.626
Gotcha, asshole.

01:16:14.437 --> 01:16:16.070
<i>In the early 1980s,</i>

01:16:16.072 --> 01:16:18.806
<i>the area around the Green
River, south of Seattle,</i>

01:16:18.808 --> 01:16:19.907
<i>was the site of one of</i>

01:16:19.909 --> 01:16:21.475
<i>the most gruesome
serial-killing sprees</i>

01:16:21.477 --> 01:16:22.677
<i>this country has ever seen.</i>

01:16:22.679 --> 01:16:24.712
<i>At least 49 women, police say,</i>

01:16:24.714 --> 01:16:26.380
<i>mostly prostitutes and runaways,</i>

01:16:26.382 --> 01:16:28.783
<i>disappeared or
were found murdered</i>

01:16:28.785 --> 01:16:30.318
<i>along this stretch of water.</i>

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:32.920
<i>Gary Leon Ridgway,
now in custody,</i>

01:16:32.922 --> 01:16:34.288
<i>was a prime suspect back then,</i>

01:16:34.290 --> 01:16:37.792
<i>but police didn't have enough
evidence to make a solid case.</i>

01:16:37.794 --> 01:16:39.727
<i>Now, new technology, police say,</i>

01:16:39.729 --> 01:16:40.962
<i>has linked Ridgway's DNA</i>

01:16:40.964 --> 01:16:42.997
<i>with DNA found on three of
the Green River victims,</i>

01:16:42.999 --> 01:16:47.101
<i>while other evidence, police
say, ties him to a fourth.</i>

01:16:47.103 --> 01:16:48.202
<i>A team of scientists</i>

01:16:48.204 --> 01:16:51.038
<i>spent more than 800
hours on the lab work.</i>

01:16:55.244 --> 01:16:58.846
They got you chained up
pretty good there, don't they?

01:17:00.383 --> 01:17:01.349
Yeah.

01:17:01.351 --> 01:17:02.817
They must be concerned about

01:17:02.819 --> 01:17:06.020
whether or not you're
gonna run off, huh?

01:17:07.757 --> 01:17:08.656
I guess so.

01:17:08.658 --> 01:17:10.858
You wouldn't
do that, would you?

01:17:11.728 --> 01:17:13.194
Not this time.

01:17:20.670 --> 01:17:22.803
Give us a minute, will you, Tom?

01:17:22.805 --> 01:17:24.171
Sure.

01:17:33.016 --> 01:17:36.517
I'm the lead investigator
on this case.

01:17:37.654 --> 01:17:38.452
I know.

01:17:38.454 --> 01:17:40.421
That means you and
I must've stood

01:17:40.423 --> 01:17:42.923
in a lot of the same places.

01:17:43.426 --> 01:17:45.559
I think we stood in every place.

01:17:45.561 --> 01:17:47.762
What do you think about that?

01:17:47.897 --> 01:17:51.532
You were on one side,
I was on the other.

01:17:51.834 --> 01:17:56.671
Where I killed them, you were
the one who recovered them.

01:17:57.540 --> 01:17:58.939
Now,

01:17:58.941 --> 01:18:00.441
finally,

01:18:00.443 --> 01:18:01.676
we meet.

01:18:01.678 --> 01:18:02.910
Yeah.

01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:07.882
I've been working on
this case a long time.

01:18:08.751 --> 01:18:12.586
Looks like I've caused
you a few gray hairs.

01:18:13.423 --> 01:18:18.392
So, Gary, you've been
pretty forthcoming so far,

01:18:18.594 --> 01:18:21.929
but do I know everything
there is to know?

01:18:22.031 --> 01:18:24.532
Yeah, I'm not holding
anything back.

01:18:26.636 --> 01:18:28.069
Can you really
look me in the eye

01:18:28.071 --> 01:18:31.639
and tell me you're not
holding anything back?

01:18:36.612 --> 01:18:39.947
I haven't been, um,

01:18:39.949 --> 01:18:40.848
you know--

01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:44.885
Wait a minute, your eyes
are going back and forth.

01:18:47.423 --> 01:18:48.989
I'm not lying to you.

01:18:48.991 --> 01:18:50.591
Yes, you are.

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:52.960
The thing is, Gary,

01:18:52.962 --> 01:18:55.596
you and I can be enemies

01:18:56.199 --> 01:18:58.299
or we can be buddies,

01:18:58.668 --> 01:19:00.935
that's your choice.

01:19:00.937 --> 01:19:02.870
If you're gonna
keep lying to me,

01:19:02.872 --> 01:19:04.805
then we'll be enemies.

01:19:05.141 --> 01:19:08.642
So, what you gonna do?

01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:12.713
I don't know what you want.

01:19:12.715 --> 01:19:14.615
The bodies.

01:19:17.787 --> 01:19:20.154
There are more, aren't there?

01:19:24.961 --> 01:19:26.160
Yes.

01:19:27.797 --> 01:19:32.600
So, how are we
gonna work together?

01:19:33.136 --> 01:19:36.036
You want me to tell
you where they are?

01:19:36.038 --> 01:19:37.304
Yes.

01:19:37.707 --> 01:19:40.808
We're gonna find every
last one of them.

01:19:46.649 --> 01:19:47.882
Alright.

01:19:49.552 --> 01:19:52.953
My memory is hazy, but I'll try.

01:19:52.955 --> 01:19:54.221
Yes, you will.

01:20:19.015 --> 01:20:22.616
We should've gotten some
champagne to celebrate.

01:20:22.618 --> 01:20:26.787
That's alright, I'm just happy
to be here with you both.

01:20:26.956 --> 01:20:28.856
How do you feel, Dad?

01:20:28.858 --> 01:20:30.157
Relieved.

01:20:30.393 --> 01:20:34.662
But the hardest part
of it all... memories.

01:20:34.664 --> 01:20:38.833
You'll get some closure now
that you've caught the guy.

01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:45.439
Yeah, Dad, it's finally over.

01:21:41.864 --> 01:21:44.565
Bob, what you doing here?

01:21:44.567 --> 01:21:47.434
Thought I'd pay you a visit
given the recent headlines.

01:21:47.436 --> 01:21:51.105
I stopped by the house,
Sandra said you might be here.

01:21:51.107 --> 01:21:53.007
It's good to see you.

01:21:53.075 --> 01:21:54.508
Been a while, huh?

01:21:54.510 --> 01:21:55.943
Yeah, it has.

01:21:55.945 --> 01:21:58.178
I think congratulations
are in order.

01:21:58.180 --> 01:22:00.114
Oh, it was a team game,

01:22:00.116 --> 01:22:01.582
you were part of that team,

01:22:01.584 --> 01:22:03.817
you should give yourself
a pat on the back.

01:22:03.819 --> 01:22:07.688
I think we can all be thankful
for the advances in DNA.

01:22:07.690 --> 01:22:09.189
True.

01:22:09.191 --> 01:22:11.258
So, what now?

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:12.726
Time to move on.

01:22:12.929 --> 01:22:17.431
Ridgway's behind bars,
the healing can begin.

01:22:19.468 --> 01:22:24.338
You know, there's one
thing I keep asking myself.

01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:27.408
How do we stop this thing
from happening again?

01:22:27.410 --> 01:22:28.542
There are a multitude of things

01:22:28.544 --> 01:22:30.644
we could do to
make a difference,

01:22:30.646 --> 01:22:34.214
greater education from
a psychology standpoint,

01:22:34.216 --> 01:22:37.618
spotting the warning signs
of psychopathy early on.

01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:40.287
From a law enforcement
standpoint, we have

01:22:40.289 --> 01:22:42.823
advances in DNA
and a better network

01:22:42.825 --> 01:22:45.793
of communication
between the agencies.

01:22:46.028 --> 01:22:50.798
But, maybe I'm getting
soft in my old age,

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:52.566
I just can't help
thinking about it

01:22:52.568 --> 01:22:54.835
from a philosophical standpoint.

01:22:55.237 --> 01:22:56.236
I'm intrigued.

01:22:56.238 --> 01:22:59.907
Well, if those of us who are
positive in our intentions

01:22:59.909 --> 01:23:01.976
spread enough love and light,

01:23:01.978 --> 01:23:03.877
maybe there won't
be so much darkness

01:23:03.879 --> 01:23:05.012
for evil to maneuver in.

01:23:05.014 --> 01:23:08.182
I never had you down
as an idealist, Bob.

01:23:08.184 --> 01:23:10.017
I never used to be.

01:23:10.019 --> 01:23:12.987
But the times, they
are a changing.

01:23:13.622 --> 01:23:15.022
You know what?

01:23:20.329 --> 01:23:22.563
I think you're right.
