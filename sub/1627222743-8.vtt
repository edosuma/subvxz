WEBVTT

00:14.405 --> 00:18.061
And repairs are complete.
Should we head back in?

00:18.105 --> 00:21.456
Wow, would you look at that?

00:23.327 --> 00:25.199
Captain, we just received
a distress call

00:25.242 --> 00:26.461
from the <i>Bakersfield.</i>

00:26.504 --> 00:28.376
They're caught in
a temporal causality loop.

00:28.419 --> 00:30.595
Wait a minute, I'm getting
the same distress call again.

00:30.639 --> 00:32.336
Hold on. And now again.

00:32.380 --> 00:33.903
Sounds like a time loop
all right.

00:33.946 --> 00:35.600
We'd better hurry.
Warp me.

00:35.644 --> 00:37.211
A view like this
makes you realize

00:37.254 --> 00:38.777
it doesn't matter what deck
you work on.

00:38.821 --> 00:40.257
We're all in it together.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.131
And they left us.

00:44.174 --> 00:45.958
They left us.
How much oxygen do we have?

00:46.002 --> 00:47.482
A lot, a little?
Ballpark?

00:47.525 --> 00:49.092
Oh, I'm sure they'll turn back
at any second

00:49.136 --> 00:51.790
and we'll have a good laugh
about it.

00:58.319 --> 01:01.322
See, guys? We're laughing.
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

02:14.743 --> 02:17.920
There we go, nothing a little
lung rejuvenation won't fix.

02:17.963 --> 02:19.313
See? You're fine.

02:19.356 --> 02:20.836
Oh, yeah, act like
it's not a big deal

02:20.879 --> 02:23.099
that you left us to
die in the void.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.622
This all could have been
avoided if you'd

02:24.666 --> 02:27.277
followed protocol and signed out
your magnet boots.

02:27.321 --> 02:28.539
Or maybe that wouldn't have
even mattered

02:28.583 --> 02:31.107
since lower decks
are so expendable to you.

02:31.151 --> 02:34.676
Ridiculous! We're all equals
on this ship, right?

02:34.719 --> 02:36.939
- Uh, they sleep in a hallway.
- Oh.

02:36.982 --> 02:38.288
I'm not going to argue
with you, Beckett.

02:38.332 --> 02:40.116
I have to make impossible
life-and-death decisions

02:40.160 --> 02:41.596
every day.

02:41.639 --> 02:44.120
Yeah, no kidding, it's always <i>
our</i> life or death.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.949
Ditch the attitude!
A Starfleet drill instructor

02:46.992 --> 02:49.386
is going to be
testing the crew later today,

02:49.430 --> 02:52.215
and I don't need you
messing up our score

02:52.259 --> 02:54.130
because you've got
a chip on your shoulder.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.958
Oh, great, yeah, well, I hope
one of the drills

02:56.001 --> 02:59.440
tests to see if anyone on the
bridge is a giant piece of...

02:59.483 --> 03:02.399
I heard the drill instructor's
Pandronian.

03:02.443 --> 03:04.706
You know they can split
their bodies into three parts?

03:04.749 --> 03:07.926
- I thought I was
a triple threat.
- Ugh.

03:07.970 --> 03:09.537
Drills, what a waste of time.

03:09.580 --> 03:12.888
I'd even take real work over
this, like fake pretend work.

03:12.931 --> 03:15.804
Good morning, <i>Cerritos!</i>

03:15.847 --> 03:17.893
This one is Shari Yn Yem,

03:17.936 --> 03:20.504
your friendly Starfleet
drill administrator.

03:20.548 --> 03:23.681
Like many of you, this one
started from the bottom,

03:23.725 --> 03:27.424
but with hard work, and plenty
of drills, this one is now...

03:27.468 --> 03:28.947
at the top!

03:31.123 --> 03:33.996
These simulator holopods are
each programed

03:34.039 --> 03:36.564
with individualized drills
based on

03:36.607 --> 03:39.741
situations other Starfleet crews
have experienced.

03:39.784 --> 03:42.831
Every pod has a certain amount
of points you can earn

03:42.874 --> 03:44.267
for doing a good job.

03:44.311 --> 03:46.487
Everyone's score is displayed
right here,

03:46.530 --> 03:49.490
so you can see how you stack up
against your fellow crew.

03:49.533 --> 03:52.057
Almost seems unfair to
make them compete with us.

03:52.101 --> 03:53.798
Gonna be a piece of cake.

03:53.842 --> 03:55.626
This one will be
flipping your ranks.

03:55.670 --> 03:59.282
Low-level officers will be
given command of the bridge,

03:59.326 --> 04:02.590
while senior officers will be
placed on the lower decks!

04:02.633 --> 04:04.287
Excuse me. What?!

04:04.331 --> 04:07.072
Well, there's no better way to
evaluate a crew's readiness

04:07.116 --> 04:08.770
than from the bottom up,
Captain.

04:08.813 --> 04:11.947
- Or should I say, Ensign?

04:11.990 --> 04:15.211
Oh, yeah! This rules!

04:15.255 --> 04:17.344
I get to be senior
medical officer!

04:17.387 --> 04:20.042
Ooh, baby, I'm chief engineer!

04:20.085 --> 04:21.173
Good day to you,
Captain Boimler.

04:21.217 --> 04:23.828
Good day to you,
Captain Mariner.

04:23.872 --> 04:25.482
They actually think they're
going to be able

04:25.526 --> 04:27.005
to handle our jobs?

04:27.049 --> 04:28.529
This is gonna be rich.

04:28.572 --> 04:30.357
All right, deck 12,
follow the yellow line.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.054
Move it along, lower decks.

04:32.097 --> 04:33.534
- Aw, son of a...

04:35.318 --> 04:38.016
- All right, let's get into it.

04:38.060 --> 04:39.975
I wanna rack up some points
early so I can spend

04:40.018 --> 04:42.412
the rest of the day soaking
in my commander's tub.

04:42.456 --> 04:45.589
<i>Mirror Universe Encounter.
- Mirror universe?</i>

04:45.633 --> 04:49.680
This is easy. Yeah. I can
pretend to be evil. Ha-ha-ha-ha!

04:49.724 --> 04:52.292
<i>As captain, you must infiltrate
the Terran Empire</i>

04:52.335 --> 04:55.164
<i>and find a way back
to your own dimension.</i>

04:55.207 --> 04:57.775
Long live the Empire.

04:57.819 --> 05:01.388
I love to hate.
Whattup, Migleemo?

05:01.431 --> 05:03.868
- Yikes.

05:03.912 --> 05:08.220
Ugh, nothing makes me hornier
than torturing someone.

05:08.264 --> 05:09.744
I'm horny all the time.

05:09.787 --> 05:12.399
And being horny always gets me
in the mood to torture.

05:12.442 --> 05:14.879
You can lose a whole day
to that cycle.

05:14.923 --> 05:17.882
Okay, screw finding an ally,
let's take over the ship and see

05:17.926 --> 05:19.928
if we can dismantle the
Terran Empire from the inside.

05:19.971 --> 05:22.757
<i>Deviation from mission
parameters</i>

05:22.800 --> 05:24.062
<i>results in loss of points.</i>

05:24.106 --> 05:25.325
Okay, all right, I get it, yeah.

05:25.368 --> 05:27.109
You're not exactly rewarding
creativity.

05:27.152 --> 05:29.285
Who dareth bump into me?!

05:29.329 --> 05:32.157
Oh, I dareth.
I double-dog dareth.

05:32.201 --> 05:33.637
Ah! Ooh!

05:33.681 --> 05:35.335
Okay, good. Just checking.

05:37.119 --> 05:40.035
I need to figure out a way to
impress or kill the captain

05:40.078 --> 05:42.342
so I can get on
a more sinister ship.

05:44.561 --> 05:46.128
Long live the Empire.

05:46.171 --> 05:48.391
Long live the-- wait,
did you just salute me

05:48.435 --> 05:49.610
with your left hand?

05:49.653 --> 05:51.351
Our Mariner is right-handed.

05:51.394 --> 05:54.397
Uh, no, I just,
uh, I strained this shoulder

05:54.441 --> 05:55.833
flogging a Vulcan.

05:55.877 --> 05:58.401
Get her!

05:58.445 --> 06:00.577
- Whoa!

06:03.406 --> 06:04.886
<i>Fail.</i>

06:04.929 --> 06:06.888
- Damn.
- Don't worry, Commander.

06:06.931 --> 06:08.498
You'll have other opportunities

06:08.542 --> 06:10.979
to get a-head.

06:11.022 --> 06:13.808
- That's one of my faves.

06:13.851 --> 06:16.985
<i>Medical ethics.
Chief medical officer.</i>

06:17.028 --> 06:20.118
<i>navigate a paralyzed Klingon's request</i>

06:20.162 --> 06:21.555

06:21.598 --> 06:23.165
Oh, uh, okay.

06:23.208 --> 06:24.819
You must help me kill myself.

06:24.862 --> 06:26.908
I broke my back
picking up a peanut.

06:26.951 --> 06:29.432
Well, as head of medical,
I'm not supposed to do any harm.

06:29.476 --> 06:30.564
- Huh?

06:30.607 --> 06:31.565
<i>Points deducted.</i>

06:31.608 --> 06:33.958
What? Oh.
I guess in that case,

06:34.002 --> 06:36.657
let's send you off
to Sto-vo-kor.

06:36.700 --> 06:39.224
No! You must use
my ceremonial blade!

06:39.268 --> 06:41.488
Ew. No. It'll be quick
and painless this way.

06:41.531 --> 06:43.098
<i>Points deducted.</i>

06:43.141 --> 06:45.274
Huh? I-I gotta hurt him?

06:45.317 --> 06:47.232
You refuse to honor my culture?!

06:47.276 --> 06:49.060
Oh, no, no, sir,
I-I wanna kill you, I...

06:49.104 --> 06:51.498
Just give me the knife. Aah!

06:51.541 --> 06:53.848
Good God, what did you do?

06:53.891 --> 06:55.110
This Klingon isn't dead.

06:55.153 --> 06:56.981
I-I was trying to save him?

06:57.025 --> 06:59.636
- What? Come on. Come on.
- Faster. Kill me. Kill!

06:59.680 --> 07:01.856
We have to get this warrior
an honorable death, stat!

07:01.899 --> 07:05.512
- Get me 300cc's of
any type of poison.
- I have to die!

07:05.555 --> 07:08.253
They have giant hearts,
so many backup organs.

07:08.297 --> 07:11.648
Sir, it's done. There's
nothing else we can do.

07:11.692 --> 07:13.607
Damn it. Call it.

07:13.650 --> 07:15.913
Time of life, 0900.

07:15.957 --> 07:18.046
No!

07:18.089 --> 07:19.743
Sorry. <i>

Yeah, yeah, I get it.
Trapped in cowboy land.

07:35.498 --> 07:37.108
It's a Starfleet classic.
Yeehaw.

07:37.152 --> 07:39.154
- Just gotta find the saloon...

07:39.197 --> 07:42.026
What? I haven't even done
anything creative.

07:42.070 --> 07:44.159
Oh, we have to ride
the horses. Okay.

07:44.202 --> 07:46.291
Seems kinda like a narrow
parameter for a drill.

07:48.076 --> 07:51.209
Calm down, horses love me;
I'm a maverick.

07:51.253 --> 07:53.951
Whoa! Aah!

Wow, this really shouldn't
be that hard.

Shut up, Ensign!
Wait, my boot.

<i>Resist the Borg.</i>

08:48.702 --> 08:50.181
Okay, you know what,

everything about the Borg;
I've got this.

08:53.010 --> 08:55.535
Wow, the detail on this
is amazing.

08:55.578 --> 08:59.060
We are Borg.
Resistance is futile.

decisions,

11:08.363 --> 11:10.931
I honestly don't know how
Dr. T'Ana does it every day.

11:10.974 --> 11:13.455
Mmm. Computer, what is this?

11:13.498 --> 11:15.370
<i>That is pesto.</i>

11:15.413 --> 11:16.937
Where's Boimler? He lives
for this kind of spread.

11:16.980 --> 11:18.765
Last I heard, he was still
doing his drill.

11:18.808 --> 11:20.941
Yeah, right. I bet he
bombed out just like us

11:20.984 --> 11:22.682
and he doesn't want to admit it.

11:22.725 --> 11:24.292
-♪

11:26.120 --> 11:27.208
We got your signal.
How were you able to...

11:27.251 --> 11:28.905
Just fly.

11:31.168 --> 11:33.562
<i>-94%.
- Again.</i>

11:33.605 --> 11:35.782
<i>Your score is already
in the top ten...</i>

11:35.825 --> 11:37.044
I said again!

11:37.087 --> 11:40.525
It hurts me to say this, but...

11:40.569 --> 11:43.877
maybe the bridge crew's jobs are
actually harder than we thought.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.879
Yeah, well, I'm sure right now
they're finding out

11:45.922 --> 11:48.533
just how hard it is to
do our jobs, too.

11:50.927 --> 11:53.800
I almost forgot how easy being
a lower-decker is.

11:53.843 --> 11:56.672
All I did was stand in the
back of a banquet all day.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.456
I just waited in
the transporter bay

11:58.500 --> 12:00.197
in case anybody
needed to be transported.

12:00.241 --> 12:02.112
Why did we ever rank up again?

12:02.156 --> 12:03.984
So what if their showers
are a little cramped,

12:04.027 --> 12:05.289
or their replicators
can only make

12:05.333 --> 12:07.422
one slice of pizza at a time?

12:07.465 --> 12:09.163
A small price to pay
for no worries

12:09.206 --> 12:10.773
and no responsibilities.

12:10.817 --> 12:13.297
Even these close quarters
don't bother me.

12:13.341 --> 12:16.823
Mmm.

12:16.866 --> 12:19.782
Yep, I could get used
to this easy life.

12:21.784 --> 12:24.134
- Ow! What the [bleep]?!

12:27.659 --> 12:29.009
<i>Klingon Encounter.</i>

12:29.052 --> 12:32.012
Really? I think I know how
to handle one of those.

12:32.055 --> 12:35.450
<i>Ensigns, your mission is to
support your commanders.</i>

12:37.017 --> 12:39.584
Stop goofing around, Ensigns!
The ship's under attack!

12:39.628 --> 12:41.848
- What happened?
- Don't worry about it.
Get to work.

12:41.891 --> 12:44.154
These crates aren't gonna
stack themselves.

12:44.198 --> 12:47.114
Really? There are Klingons on
the other side of the hull,

12:47.157 --> 12:49.029
and this is our job?

12:49.072 --> 12:50.552
Aw, son of a...

12:51.771 --> 12:53.424
If they wanted us
to stack these,

12:53.468 --> 12:55.470
then why are they shaped
like this?!

12:55.513 --> 12:56.688
Quick! Have you seen
a Q come through here?

12:56.732 --> 12:58.734
- Q is on the ship?
- Forget I said anything.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.171
Commander, wait.
We're Starfleet officers.

13:01.215 --> 13:02.651
We can help you,
just tell us what's...

13:02.694 --> 13:05.349
The Jem'Hadar?
Get to battle stations!

13:05.393 --> 13:06.698
Damn it!

13:06.742 --> 13:08.309
Aha! I got it.

13:10.702 --> 13:12.269
<i>Failed!</i>

13:16.317 --> 13:19.407
Now that both sides have been
put through individual tests,

13:19.450 --> 13:22.802
your last drill will be

13:22.845 --> 13:24.107
a simulated experience

13:24.151 --> 13:26.501
that uses your real bridge.

13:26.544 --> 13:29.417
The true test of a crew is
seeing how you can

13:29.460 --> 13:30.984
unite as a single team.

13:31.027 --> 13:33.377
"Steal the <i>Cerritos
from spacedock</i>

13:33.421 --> 13:35.292
and use it to save Spock
on the Genesis planet."

13:35.336 --> 13:37.642
- Okay, yeah.
- An oldie but a goodie.

13:37.686 --> 13:40.558
And just what do you think
you're doing, Ensign Freeman?

13:40.602 --> 13:42.473
Force of habit.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.736
All right, look alive, people.
Yeoman Ransom,

13:44.780 --> 13:46.869
let's get some fresh coffee
on deck.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.349
Yes, sir.

13:48.392 --> 13:50.481
Ensign Freeman, full thrusters,
take us out.

13:50.525 --> 13:53.702
Aye, Captain.
90 seconds to spacedock.

13:55.312 --> 13:56.966
Ensign Shaxs,
what are you doing?

13:57.010 --> 13:59.055
Requesting permission to
stretch, Captain.

13:59.099 --> 14:02.189
My back's killing me
from sleeping in those bunks.

14:02.232 --> 14:05.061
Oh, it's naked time!

14:05.105 --> 14:07.498
Ugh! No.
Stop that. Stop now.

14:07.542 --> 14:08.586
Geez, what's gotten into you?

14:08.630 --> 14:10.110
It's-it's just something

14:10.153 --> 14:11.415
I'm remembering from the drills.

14:11.459 --> 14:12.547
The one where you couldn't even

14:12.590 --> 14:13.722
get on a horse?

14:13.765 --> 14:15.071
How do you know about that?

14:15.115 --> 14:16.856
The drills are public, Beckett.

14:16.899 --> 14:18.248
I watched the playback.

14:18.292 --> 14:20.685
I'm just saying,
two and a half years of lessons

14:20.729 --> 14:23.079
- and that's what you had
to show for it?

14:23.123 --> 14:24.341
Congratulations, Ensign.

14:24.385 --> 14:25.908
You've earned yourself
a trip to the brig.

14:25.952 --> 14:27.214
- I've never been sent
to the brig.

14:27.257 --> 14:29.390
- Well, now you have.
- On what grounds?

14:29.433 --> 14:30.565
On my grounds!

14:33.307 --> 14:34.699
Beckett,
I am speaking!

14:34.743 --> 14:37.224
Captain, did you want
your coffee with cream or...

14:37.267 --> 14:39.443
Dang.
That's gotta be a record.

14:39.487 --> 14:41.184
Actually, it is.

14:43.752 --> 14:46.189
I can't believe we didn't even
make it out of the spacedock.

14:46.233 --> 14:48.365
There's not even a numerical
score for that.

14:48.409 --> 14:49.976
Just "incomplete."

14:50.019 --> 14:51.934
Oof, somehow that feels worse.

14:51.978 --> 14:53.631
- I guess I...
- You know I...

14:53.675 --> 14:55.329
- Oh, you go.
- No, no, no, you.

14:55.372 --> 14:57.940
You know, it's been so
long since I've been an ensign,

14:57.984 --> 15:00.421
I forgot how hard it can be
when you're not in the loop.

15:00.464 --> 15:04.381
In a lot of ways, taking orders
is the more challenging job.

15:04.425 --> 15:06.557
That's nice to hear, but ditto.

15:06.601 --> 15:08.168
Commander-level stuff is hard.

15:08.211 --> 15:10.779
Just the constant tightrope
walk of protocol.

15:10.822 --> 15:12.259
Not worth the pesto.

15:12.302 --> 15:13.608
Guess the carpet's always grayer

15:13.651 --> 15:16.176
- on the other side of the ship.
- Big-time.

15:16.219 --> 15:18.961
Do they
know what "stacked" means?

15:19.005 --> 15:21.050
We're stacking
for what reason?

15:21.094 --> 15:23.009
Hold on.

15:23.052 --> 15:25.098
That's what this has all
been about.

15:25.141 --> 15:26.926
That drills consultant
made us suffer

15:26.969 --> 15:28.536
through all of this crap

15:28.579 --> 15:31.017
just so we'd understand
what the other ranks go through.

15:31.060 --> 15:32.540
That's the actual drill here.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.107
Ugh, you're right!

15:34.150 --> 15:36.239
Where is that
tri-bodied little trickster?

15:36.283 --> 15:37.980
I want to shake her hand.

15:39.721 --> 15:41.418
Yo, Shari Yingo Yango,

15:41.462 --> 15:43.333
- we figured you out, girl.
- You did?

15:43.377 --> 15:46.293
Yeah, these drills were
secretly about team building.

15:46.336 --> 15:48.773
You came in to make us
appreciate each other more.

15:48.817 --> 15:51.472
And it worked! Thanks to you,
the <i>Cerritos</i> crew will

15:51.515 --> 15:53.300
move forward with
greater empathy

15:53.343 --> 15:55.867
and a deeper
appreciation for each other.

15:59.654 --> 16:03.832
Oh, no, you won't be moving
forward at all.

16:10.534 --> 16:11.535
- What are you--

16:11.579 --> 16:13.929
what is she laughing about?

16:13.973 --> 16:15.148
Oh, come on.

16:15.191 --> 16:16.845
Your drills scores
are well below failing.

16:16.888 --> 16:18.934
Once they're submitted,
Starfleet Command will

16:18.978 --> 16:21.850
relegate and reassign
this entire crew.

16:21.893 --> 16:23.417
So this wasn't about teamwork?

16:23.460 --> 16:25.201
Teamwork? No.

16:25.245 --> 16:26.768
This was about
saving my job.

16:26.811 --> 16:29.292
The bigger ships always passed
my drills with no problem.

16:29.336 --> 16:30.902
It was starting to seem
like we didn't

16:30.946 --> 16:32.252
need a drills program at all.

16:32.295 --> 16:34.254
This one needed a crew
to fall short

16:34.297 --> 16:36.473
to prove the drills were
still valuable,

16:36.517 --> 16:38.606
and, oh, did I find a crew.

16:38.649 --> 16:40.695
You targeted us for failure?

16:40.738 --> 16:42.958
This is a ship whose captain
left four ensigns

16:43.002 --> 16:45.482
on a spacewalk to answer
a distress call.

16:45.526 --> 16:47.180
It was a pretty safe bet.

16:47.223 --> 16:50.357
And, of course, it didn't hurt
to goose the drills a bit.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.186
Oh, I knew it. That mirror
universe drill was rigged.

16:53.229 --> 16:55.666
They were all rigged!

16:55.710 --> 16:58.800
And those horses. I would never
get trampled by a horse.

16:58.843 --> 17:00.193
Oh, actually, no,
the horses weren't rigged.

17:00.236 --> 17:01.803
I ran out of time.
That one's on you.

17:01.846 --> 17:02.934
Horses love me. Shut up!

17:02.978 --> 17:05.067
We won't let you
get away with this.

17:05.111 --> 17:07.287
<i>Cerritos</i> crew, we've got
to do more drills

17:07.330 --> 17:08.766
- to get our scores up.
- It's too late.

17:08.810 --> 17:11.073
Once the drills
have been failed,

17:11.117 --> 17:12.379
you're locked out.

17:12.422 --> 17:14.859
Soon this one
will submit your final scores

17:14.903 --> 17:16.513
to Starfleet, and that will be
the end of...

17:16.557 --> 17:18.472
Wait, shut up,
the drills aren't over.

17:18.515 --> 17:20.213
- One is still active.
- What? Which one?

17:20.256 --> 17:21.649
- It's Boimler!
- How?

17:21.692 --> 17:23.868
That Borg drill should've
been over hours ago.

17:23.912 --> 17:25.131
Well, it doesn't matter.

17:25.174 --> 17:27.307
One passing score will make
little difference.

17:27.350 --> 17:30.658
- If the drills aren't
finished...
- Our scores aren't final!

17:30.701 --> 17:32.181
Boimler, can you hear me?

17:32.225 --> 17:34.575
Hey, Mariner, I was just about
to close out this drill.

17:34.618 --> 17:36.751
- I finally got a perfect... <i>
Don't you finish
that drill, Ensign.</i>

17:36.794 --> 17:38.057
<i>That's an order!</i>

17:38.100 --> 17:39.710
Captain, but I beat
the Borg Queen in chess,

17:39.754 --> 17:41.973
- and I taught her empathy. <i>
- Just stay in that drill!</i>

17:42.017 --> 17:44.063
The crew is counting on you.

17:44.106 --> 17:45.847
Yeah, Shari Bing Bang
is trying to screw us,

17:45.890 --> 17:47.718
<i>but she can't
until your drill is over.</i>

17:47.762 --> 17:49.546
<i>-Just keep Borging!
- I'm on it.</i>

17:49.590 --> 17:52.158
Resistance is futile.

17:52.201 --> 17:53.637
Aw, man.

17:53.681 --> 17:56.249
You know you've already lost,
right?

17:56.292 --> 17:58.555
All you're doing is
torturing that young officer.

17:58.599 --> 18:00.340
He'll be fine.
He's one of our best.

18:00.383 --> 18:02.124
- He is?
- None of you are the best.

18:02.168 --> 18:03.995
You're on
a California Class ship.

18:04.039 --> 18:06.520
Most of the Federation
doesn't even know you exist.

18:06.563 --> 18:08.478
The smaller the ship,
the tougher the crew.

18:08.522 --> 18:10.219
Oh, please, face the truth.

18:10.263 --> 18:11.655
This one's made the drills.

18:11.699 --> 18:13.875
This one's read all about life
on starships.

18:13.918 --> 18:16.965
Exactly. You've read
how to work in space,

18:17.008 --> 18:19.924
but have you ever been in a real
life-or-death situation?

18:19.968 --> 18:22.362
- That doesn't matter.
- It's about to.

18:22.405 --> 18:24.712
Captain on deck!
Real captain.

18:24.755 --> 18:28.107
Ensign Tendi, run a long-range
scan for any potentially

18:28.150 --> 18:29.717
hazardous anomalies
in this system.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.371
Yes, sir. Is this a new drill?

18:31.414 --> 18:33.329
Oh, no, this is real.

18:33.373 --> 18:35.505
What is that supposed to mean?

18:35.549 --> 18:38.204
All right, let's see, we've got
a tetryon wormhole,

18:38.247 --> 18:39.857
chroniton radiation stream.

18:39.901 --> 18:41.163
Ooh, a loner crystalline entity,

18:41.207 --> 18:43.905
a crystalline entity
consuming a rogue planet,

18:43.948 --> 18:45.950
a couple crystalline entities
getting frisky-- huh.

18:45.994 --> 18:47.517
Lots of, lots of
crystalline entities today.

18:47.561 --> 18:49.693
Must be crystalline entity
season or something.

18:49.737 --> 18:51.478
Ensign, set an intercept course

18:51.521 --> 18:53.001
for one of those
crystalline entities.

18:53.044 --> 18:54.742
- Warp four.
- Aye aye, Captain!

18:54.785 --> 18:57.701
"The Crystalline Entity"
is drill number 89.

18:57.745 --> 18:59.399
A classic. Can't wait.

19:00.443 --> 19:02.271
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, no!

19:02.315 --> 19:03.794
No, no, no, no, no.

19:03.838 --> 19:05.622
Come on, Mariner, whatever
you're doing up there, hurry!

19:05.666 --> 19:07.537
Aah! Borg Queen!

19:11.062 --> 19:13.500
Uh, how-how's the empathy?

19:13.543 --> 19:15.458
We were able to assimilate it.

19:15.502 --> 19:18.766
No, no, no, no, no, my score!

19:20.811 --> 19:22.726
Captain, we've reached
the crystalline entity.

19:22.770 --> 19:25.860
It appears to be feeding on
unstable nebula radiation.

19:25.903 --> 19:28.210
Oh, my, it's bigger
than this one thought.

19:28.254 --> 19:29.472
Unstable, huh?

19:29.516 --> 19:31.561
Seems like something
we should investigate.

19:31.605 --> 19:32.997
Shields up, take us in.

19:33.041 --> 19:34.782
What? No! In my drill,
you're never supposed to...

19:34.825 --> 19:36.087
This isn't a drill.

19:41.615 --> 19:43.356
Shields holding, Captain,

19:43.399 --> 19:45.967
but I'm reading transphasic
energy within the perimeter.

19:46.010 --> 19:49.057
That's a new one.
Let's get a closer look!

19:49.100 --> 19:52.278
No! We don't know
the effect of--

19:52.321 --> 19:53.757
Controls are getting choppy.

19:53.801 --> 19:55.759
<i>We're caught
in an electromagnetic</i>

19:55.803 --> 19:58.675
resonance belt.
I think we're in trouble!

19:58.719 --> 20:00.808
This is not good!

20:00.851 --> 20:03.071
Whoa!

20:07.902 --> 20:11.688
Mariner, I really need
to get out of here. Like now!

20:11.732 --> 20:12.950
- Ooh.

20:12.994 --> 20:14.125
Kinda tickles.

20:14.169 --> 20:15.866
A remarkable creature.

20:15.910 --> 20:18.565
Your design very nearly passes
as human.

20:18.608 --> 20:20.349
- I am human.
- Oh!

20:20.393 --> 20:23.309
Wow. Then you
need to drink more water.

20:23.352 --> 20:25.049
Your skin is a mess.

20:25.093 --> 20:28.618
But still, I think I should add
your biological distinctiveness

20:28.662 --> 20:31.404
to our own;
it's kind of our thing.

20:31.447 --> 20:33.144
Are-are you sure?
Because I've got

20:33.188 --> 20:34.798
hay fever and acid reflux.

20:34.842 --> 20:38.149
Adding me might result in a net
negative for the collective.

20:41.979 --> 20:43.894
Oh, this one's gonna puke.

20:43.938 --> 20:46.897
We need to fire a graviton
pulse to punch a hole out.

20:46.941 --> 20:50.249
On my mark. Mmm...

20:50.292 --> 20:52.729
Say "mark"! Say "mark"!
What are you waiting for?!

20:52.773 --> 20:55.689
Just making sure you're as
scared as you're going to get.

20:55.732 --> 20:57.299
- You're crazy!
- Mark!

20:57.343 --> 20:58.257
Full impulse!

21:05.351 --> 21:08.484
Mariner, find me something else
dangerous to scan.

21:08.528 --> 21:10.747
I'm in the mood
for a black hole.

21:10.791 --> 21:12.183
- Why?!
- We're gonna keep doing this

21:12.227 --> 21:14.316
until you change our score.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.579
There's a black hole feeding on
a temporal rift

21:16.623 --> 21:18.886
just three systems over.
Lots of time quakes.

21:18.929 --> 21:21.367
Sounds perfect. Maximum warp.

21:23.369 --> 21:25.196
You can't blackmail me at
the expense of your crew.

21:25.240 --> 21:27.068
They do this kind of work
every day.

21:27.111 --> 21:28.635
You gonna give us
a passing grade,

21:28.678 --> 21:30.463
or are we just
gonna keep seeking out

21:30.506 --> 21:32.247
dangerous situations for you

21:32.291 --> 21:34.336
<i>to see up close?</i>

21:36.773 --> 21:39.428
<i>Stop! Stop! We can't!</i>

21:41.648 --> 21:43.693
Get me out of here!
Get me out of here!

21:43.737 --> 21:47.044
We could do this all day, lady!

21:48.350 --> 21:52.006
All right, fine.
You win, you win!

21:52.049 --> 21:54.313
There, it's done.
You've passed.

21:54.356 --> 21:56.140
Mr. Rutherford, stop our spin.

21:56.184 --> 21:57.098
Aye, Captain.

21:58.795 --> 22:01.798
What? But the
temporal black hole...

22:01.842 --> 22:04.584
Well, that was kind of a lie.
It's just a regular black hole.

22:04.627 --> 22:05.889
Yeah, no biggie.

22:05.933 --> 22:07.195
Which you would have known
if you weren't

22:07.238 --> 22:08.979
a total fraud.

22:09.023 --> 22:11.112
I'll be sure to put that
in my report.

22:14.071 --> 22:16.117
Boimler! We did it.
Hey, it's all good.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.597
You can exit the drill now.

22:17.640 --> 22:18.989
Boimler?

22:28.434 --> 22:30.479
I can him hear him shuffling
around in there.

22:30.523 --> 22:32.916
Mr. Boimler!
You can come out now.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.309
You saved the ship!

22:34.353 --> 22:37.181
There is no Boimler.
I am Excretus of Borg.

22:37.225 --> 22:38.052
Get him out of there!

22:41.447 --> 22:43.318
Assimilate.
I must assimilate!

22:43.362 --> 22:46.147
I, uh--
Where am I?

22:46.190 --> 22:48.279
You're still on the <i>Cerritos,
Mr. Boimler.</i>

22:48.323 --> 22:50.499
The crew owes you
a debt of gratitude.

22:50.543 --> 22:53.284
I was assimilated.
They-they put implants up my...

22:53.328 --> 22:54.982
Ear is where they put
the implants.

22:55.025 --> 22:57.811
Right in your ear.
Come on, pal, you need a drink.

22:57.854 --> 22:59.943
Did I, did I
get my perfect score?

22:59.987 --> 23:02.206
You sure did.
A hundred percent.

23:02.250 --> 23:05.993
Hell yeah. Hit me. Hit me again.

23:10.127 --> 23:12.173
Shari Yn Yem is no longer
working for Starfleet.

23:12.216 --> 23:16.090
Apparently she stepped down
because of on-the-job stress.

23:16.133 --> 23:17.831
Feels good,
ruining a jerk's career.

23:17.874 --> 23:20.573
Agreed. And there was
one thing she did manage

23:20.616 --> 23:22.096
to teach us today.

23:22.139 --> 23:24.098
Whoa, new replicator?

23:24.141 --> 23:26.056
Let's just say we experienced

23:26.100 --> 23:27.536
what the lower decks
have been eating,

23:27.580 --> 23:29.886
and noticed it could
use some improvement.

23:29.930 --> 23:33.586
We updated this one with most of
the senior officer menu codes.

23:33.629 --> 23:34.804
We get pesto?!

23:34.848 --> 23:36.284
If you're going to be
facing danger

23:36.327 --> 23:37.503
on a daily basis,

23:37.546 --> 23:39.418
might as well get
the good stuff.

23:39.461 --> 23:41.594
Thanks, guys.
Aw, this is really nice.

23:41.637 --> 23:42.943
Ooh, ooh, does it make
the lobster mac and cheese

23:42.986 --> 23:44.205
with the breaded top?

23:44.248 --> 23:45.424
<i>Sounds like the one thing</i>

23:45.467 --> 23:46.599
<i>the Borg left you with</i>

23:46.642 --> 23:48.427
<i>-was your appetite.</i>

23:48.470 --> 23:50.690
<i>They took everything
that I was.</i>
