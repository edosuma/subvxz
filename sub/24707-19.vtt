- Previously on NYPD Blue.
- People, places...

00:04.818 --> 00:07.061
the things they do,
the times they do 'em.

00:07.129 --> 00:12.064
- Say that.
- People, places, the things they do, the times they do 'em.

00:12.136 --> 00:17.388
A beat cop knows those four things,
he's ready to do his job.

00:17.463 --> 00:19.739
- I gotta say this, Adrianne.
- Go ahead.

00:19.805 --> 00:22.179
- You're driving me a little nuts.
- I knew this was coming.

00:22.244 --> 00:25.899
You made something out of absolutely nothing
between me and that girl.

00:25.967 --> 00:29.523
- This baby is moving.
- Like right now?

00:29.593 --> 00:32.022
Do you wanna feel it?

00:32.097 --> 00:34.307
Give me your hand.

00:34.376 --> 00:36.389
Wow.

Peep.

01:02.008 --> 01:03.955
Sipowicz.

01:05.087 --> 01:09.443
Yeah. Um, hold on a second.
Mm-hmm.

01:09.516 --> 01:12.142
Ooh.

01:12.212 --> 01:16.283
What? Uh, yeah, I know.

01:16.352 --> 01:19.460
Mm-hmm. All right.
I'm on my way.

01:20.685 --> 01:23.410
Sylvia, are you
having contractions?

01:23.477 --> 01:26.650
- I think it's the same as last week.
- That repositioning thing?

01:26.719 --> 01:31.074
- Or is it different?
- Well, it feels the same right now, Andy.

01:31.147 --> 01:33.609
Should we get another beeper number
that my office doesn't have?

01:33.682 --> 01:38.935
That way, only you have it, and if you
wanna beep me, I'll know it's you...

01:39.010 --> 01:41.887
and we use that exclusively for labor,
and you don't have to put in 911."

01:41.962 --> 01:45.267
- No.
- 'Cause you'd have to learn another number, right?

01:45.333 --> 01:47.958
- That's what makes it a bad idea.
- Yeah.

01:48.028 --> 01:53.345
- What did the squad want?
- Homicide. I really oughta go.

01:53.420 --> 01:55.882
'Kay.

02:00.961 --> 02:04.616
- 911. That's a go code.
- Got it.

02:16.109 --> 02:19.380
It's the baby readjusting.
The lower pelvic area's makin' room.

02:19.446 --> 02:23.287
- So it's not the real deal.
- No. At the present moment, she don't think so.

02:23.362 --> 02:25.473
Hey.

02:25.544 --> 02:29.297
D.O.A.'s Etta Stubbs. Neighbor across the hall
called it in. His name's Mario Walker.

02:29.364 --> 02:32.569
Found a bloody hammer
over there on the floor.

02:32.637 --> 02:35.941
No signs of the hammer blows on the bag.

02:37.739 --> 02:40.847
Nah. This had to be put over her head
after she was killed.

02:40.917 --> 02:43.225
Found a busted bottle of beer
on the kitchen floor.

02:43.292 --> 02:47.679
Bedroom's torn up good. There's a blood smear
on the drawer where we found the checkbook.

02:47.752 --> 02:49.613
- Get the neighbor?
- Yeah. He's right there.

02:49.678 --> 02:53.486
Hey, a couple of different tenants
say she had a nephew who was a bad kid.

02:53.561 --> 02:57.117
- Nephew's name is Billy.
- I'm gonna talk to this guy.

02:57.187 --> 02:59.332
Yeah.

03:01.873 --> 03:04.564
- Bobby, this is Mr. Walker. Detective Simone.
- Hi.

03:04.633 --> 03:07.675
- You found Miss Stubbs this morning?
- I live just across the hall.

03:07.746 --> 03:10.601
Come back from buying my paper.
Etta's door's wide open.

03:10.666 --> 03:12.843
I go in.
She's dead on the couch.

03:12.913 --> 03:15.341
You oughta be lookin'
for her nephew about this.

03:15.416 --> 03:18.239
- This would be Billy?
- Ajunkie and a thief.

03:18.305 --> 03:22.572
She let him do oddjobs for her.
She even got me to use him once.

03:22.637 --> 03:25.459
- He stole my damn radio.
- You know where Billy lives?

03:25.525 --> 03:28.282
I don't know ifhe has a place.
I saw him on Fourth and'D"...

03:28.350 --> 03:30.363
with the rest
of thejunkies and crackheads.

03:30.435 --> 03:33.673
That's him.
She didn't have any children of her own.

03:33.741 --> 03:38.971
- Thanks for your cooperation.
- If you can think of anything else, we'd appreciate a call.

03:39.036 --> 03:42.012
Looks like he cleaned out the bedroom drawers
and ripped off some checks.

03:42.084 --> 03:45.772
- There's three missing since the last entry in her checkbook.
- Hmm.

03:45.839 --> 03:49.165
Nuts.

03:49.241 --> 03:52.962
- What?
- 911. I gotta pick up my girls at dance class.

03:53.028 --> 03:57.000
- You get 911 for a dancing class message?
- Yeah. Marie can't make it.

03:57.072 --> 04:02.752
- That's the wrong use of911."
- Andy, it's a private communication via beeper.

04:02.816 --> 04:06.624
Are you with me, Medavoy, huh?
She's misusing that code.

04:09.203 --> 04:11.380
Sylvia's gettin' contractions.

04:11.450 --> 04:13.506
Oh, boy.

05:25.779 --> 05:31.196
- What'd you get?
- D.O.A.'s a 65-year-old black woman, Etta Stubbs.

05:31.266 --> 05:35.336
She was beat to death with a hammer.
Perp stole some blank personal checks and jewelry.

05:35.406 --> 05:37.780
The D.O.A. Has a junkie nephew that
all the neighbors like for the homicide.

05:37.846 --> 05:42.649
- Get a line on the nephew?
- No address on him. He cops over on Fourth and Avenue D."

05:42.723 --> 05:45.316
- We got his picture.
- I'm notifying her bank, checking accounts, cards.

05:45.387 --> 05:49.260
- Then we'll grab this kid.
- I'm gonna run him through B.C.I.

05:49.335 --> 05:52.475
- Where's Donna?
- Maybe she's in thejohn?

05:52.543 --> 05:55.005
She fall in?

06:00.631 --> 06:03.290
- Hey, Donna.
- Hi.

06:04.803 --> 06:09.071
- Employee's orientation kit.
- You got a job with Apple?

06:09.135 --> 06:13.939
My computer course included free enrollment
at a city college job fair last month.

06:14.014 --> 06:18.281
When I attended more or less on a lark,
I gave my transcript and resume to their recruiter.

06:18.346 --> 06:21.836
They just offered me
an area associates position...

06:21.908 --> 06:24.086
which is a fancy name
for exactly what I do here...

06:24.155 --> 06:26.748
but supposably,"
there's no promotion ceiling.

06:26.818 --> 06:29.794
- That's great, Donna.
- I don't think I'm gonna do it.

06:29.867 --> 06:34.255
- The position's in Silicon Valley, California.
- They don't have jobs here?

06:34.328 --> 06:37.983
Well, I applied for out there. I mean,
the whole thing was more or less a lark.

06:38.050 --> 06:42.055
- Uh-huh.
- At the end of the day, it's not realistic.

06:42.127 --> 06:46.197
Me in Silicon Valley. They probably
couldn't even understand my accent.

06:46.266 --> 06:50.271
- It's nice to know you're wanted.
- I got caught up in the whole lark aspect...

06:50.342 --> 06:52.936
seeing if they'd want me.

06:56.729 --> 06:58.997
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

06:59.125 --> 07:01.105
- Any calls?
- Should I look out for one?

07:01.179 --> 07:04.221
Sylvia's having contractions.

07:04.292 --> 07:07.268
She don't feel they're significant.

07:07.341 --> 07:11.214
- Have you discussed getting a beeper?
- We got one.

07:11.288 --> 07:13.848
I just thought maybe
she might've called off previous habit.

07:13.919 --> 07:17.312
- Uh-uh.
- All right. Thanks.

07:17.386 --> 07:21.621
Two collars for possession.
Two collars for petty larceny. The nephew.

07:21.686 --> 07:23.896
Let's pick him up.

07:23.965 --> 07:26.908
Have we discussed
gettin' a beeper?

07:26.982 --> 07:30.220
- Hey, James.
- Hey, Bob.

07:30.287 --> 07:32.332
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:36.063 --> 07:39.488
- So did you talk to her last night?
- I stayed at my folks'.

07:39.561 --> 07:41.990
That robbery-
I was still concerned.

07:42.065 --> 07:44.976
- Oh, yeah. That one last week.
- Yeah.

07:45.050 --> 07:49.798
- Maybe I'll talk to her tonight.
- Well, if your decision's firm, it's probably a good idea...

07:49.863 --> 07:53.868
'cause, you know, I think Adrianne
senses the drift of things.

07:53.940 --> 07:57.145
I'm looking for the time
that causes her the least upset.

07:57.213 --> 08:01.381
Yeah, 'cause postponing the inevitable
just makes matters fester worse.

08:01.674 --> 08:04.102
Robbery/homicide.
You guys are catchin'.

08:04.177 --> 08:06.803
Adrianne, Diane,
you wanna work this with Greg and James?

08:06.872 --> 08:10.177
Yeah. Sure.

08:16.500 --> 08:20.220
- Hey.
- D.O.A. 's a bouncer, Carl Maclntyre.

08:20.288 --> 08:22.716
Bartender called in.
He got stomped up too.

08:22.790 --> 08:24.771
- Where's the bartender at?
- They took him to Bellevue.

08:24.845 --> 08:27.307
- What a brawl.
- I meant to ask how your parents are.

08:27.380 --> 08:31.166
They're okay. Still somewhat concerned
off their neighbor getting robbed.

08:31.231 --> 08:35.104
- Well, they're lucky they have you.
- My place. Let me in.

08:35.178 --> 08:37.573
- Let me in.
- Let him through. I'm Detective Medavoy.

08:37.649 --> 08:40.023
- You own the place?
- Frank Delva. Yeah.

08:40.089 --> 08:43.874
- Geez. They get the safe?
- We don't know yet.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.763
- I'd like to ask you a few questions.
- Be careful what you touch here.

08:46.828 --> 08:49.323
- Yeah, yeah.
- Mr. Delva, you know who might have done this?

08:49.395 --> 08:52.371
Anyone in the place.
The clientele is human dump.

08:52.444 --> 08:55.486
The bouncer have any specific enemies
you know about?

08:55.557 --> 08:58.730
Paul? No. I don't know.

08:58.799 --> 09:03.066
- The bartender got beat on too.
- I don't know who his enemies were.

09:03.131 --> 09:07.366
- Thank you, God.
- You keep a lot of dough in there.

09:07.431 --> 09:10.790
- Yeah. I cash paychecks.
- Anyone who might've had it in for you, Mr. Delva?

09:10.866 --> 09:13.043
My two ex-wives,
but they don't know what city I'm in.

09:13.111 --> 09:15.902
- Anyone working protection,
shaking you down?

09:15.968 --> 09:18.276
No. I got no problem
with those guys.

09:18.343 --> 09:21.931
- So you got no help for us?
- I gotta call my insurance company.

09:22.002 --> 09:23.982
Excuse me.

09:25.884 --> 09:28.740
First impressions,
I wouldn't mind whacking that guy.

09:47.130 --> 09:50.883
Green hat. Is that our guy?

09:52.393 --> 09:54.603
Yeah.

09:57.367 --> 10:01.307
- He's looking to steal from that car.
- Yeah.

10:01.379 --> 10:04.705
Got no warrants out. Let him try
to boost something so we can pop him.

10:29.204 --> 10:31.512
- Sir, this your car? - Yeah.
- Can I see your registration?

10:31.578 --> 10:33.821
- See your keys.
- Come on, man. Let mejust put the camera back.

10:33.889 --> 10:36.766
- You put back the camera, then you're right with the world?
- I got the cars confused.

10:36.841 --> 10:39.664
All right. You're under arrest.
Come here. Turn around.

10:39.730 --> 10:42.870
What do you got here?
Women's jewelry? You wear this stuff?

10:42.939 --> 10:45.402
- I'm holding it for somebody.
- Sure. I'll buy that.

10:45.474 --> 10:47.902
- Give me your hand.
- Your name Billy Stubbs?

10:47.977 --> 10:51.282
- How do you know that?
- All right. Come on.

10:51.347 --> 10:54.553
Let's go.

11:07.362 --> 11:10.852
- Is that the junkie nephew?
- Had the D.O.A.'s jewelry in his pocket.

11:10.923 --> 11:14.249
- What's he saying?
- He was holding it for somebody.

11:14.325 --> 11:17.750
My beeper.

11:17.823 --> 11:21.511
Sylvia, but no 911.

11:23.279 --> 11:26.004
Yeah. Yeah. Hello.

11:26.071 --> 11:29.977
Uh, fine. You want me
to meet you there?

11:30.051 --> 11:32.776
You should've used the 911.

11:32.843 --> 11:36.629
Well, I can meet you
over there anyway.

11:36.694 --> 11:39.670
All right.
Whatever you say.

11:39.743 --> 11:43.168
You'll let me know, then, right?
You'll beep me? All right.

11:43.240 --> 11:47.891
Okay. I'm thinkin' about you.
Mm-hmm. Bye.

11:51.393 --> 11:56.262
The doctor, he doesn't think
it's labor, but he wants her to come to his office.

11:56.334 --> 11:58.730
- She don't want me to go with her.
- Well, ifhe thought it was time...

11:58.805 --> 12:00.786
he'd have her go
right to the hospital.

12:00.860 --> 12:04.482
He's supposed to be excellent, this guy.
Sylvia's got confidence in him.

12:04.550 --> 12:09.036
- Yeah. That's important.
- Young Jewish guy. He's delivered hundreds of infants.

12:09.107 --> 12:11.733
Mm-hmm.

12:13.953 --> 12:18.406
- I'll go talk to this kid.
- Yeah.

12:18.478 --> 12:22.451
- You know what this is about, Billy?
- That camera, man.

12:22.522 --> 12:26.395
- Where's this blood from?
- I guess I cut myself.

12:30.481 --> 12:34.453
And you were holding this stuff
in this envelope for your friend?

12:34.524 --> 12:36.833
Yeah.

12:39.242 --> 12:41.967
That's your Aunt Etta's jewelry
in that envelope there, Billy.

12:42.034 --> 12:45.339
When was the last time
you seen your Aunt Etta?

12:45.404 --> 12:47.965
- Couple days.
- Couple of days? You gonna sit there and lie to me?

12:48.036 --> 12:50.826
What are you gonna say when I tell you
that we have several eyewitnesses...

12:50.891 --> 12:55.181
that put you
at your aunt's building this morning?

12:55.256 --> 12:57.817
- Were you at that building this morning?
- All right.

12:57.888 --> 12:59.748
- All right, what?
- I was there.

12:59.813 --> 13:03.084
I rang the bell, but nobody answered.
I guess that's when they saw me.

13:03.151 --> 13:06.422
Are you gonna change your story when I say
that they saw you inside the building?

13:06.489 --> 13:08.765
Where'd you get the jewelry?

13:08.831 --> 13:12.224
This guy asked me to hold it for him.
It was in that envelope.

13:12.298 --> 13:16.138
I didn't look inside till afterwards.
He'd been in my aunt's house once with me.

13:16.213 --> 13:19.835
So this guy who's been
to your aunt's place once...

13:19.904 --> 13:24.193
he must've broken into your Aunt Etta's
and took all her jewelry...

13:24.268 --> 13:27.474
and then asked you to hold it.

13:27.541 --> 13:30.102
What's this guy's name?

13:30.173 --> 13:32.569
Larry something. Larry.

13:32.644 --> 13:34.952
Where we gonna
find Larry... something?

13:35.020 --> 13:38.510
He said he was leavin' town.
That's why he wanted me to hold that.

13:38.581 --> 13:42.236
- This is like the worst story I ever heard.
- It's what happened.

13:42.304 --> 13:46.572
Billy, this stuff is so bogus,
you can't even get behind it.

13:46.636 --> 13:51.352
You know what I think happened? I think you did
something to your aunt that makes you sick.

13:52.509 --> 13:54.687
We could bring this
to the D.A. Right now...

13:54.756 --> 13:58.509
as a vicious,
cold-blooded homicide.

14:00.437 --> 14:05.984
I don't think that was your intention,
'cause I can see you jonesing...

14:06.053 --> 14:08.678
so I know you needed to score.

14:08.749 --> 14:11.724
But you didn't
sell your aunt's jewelry.

14:11.797 --> 14:16.863
We collar you stealin' a camera,
with her jewelry still in your pocket.

14:16.932 --> 14:19.427
That tells me that you loved her.

14:19.500 --> 14:24.183
You saying to yourself, 'Aw, man.
Let mejust try boostin'this camera...

14:24.249 --> 14:27.007
not sell my aunt's stuff
unless I can't get over on the street."

14:29.095 --> 14:31.950
Is that what
you were thinking, Billy?

14:32.016 --> 14:34.674
Leave me alone, man.

14:34.743 --> 14:38.069
Billy, I've been on this job long enough
to know where people are at.

14:38.145 --> 14:43.398
You don't get right with this, behind
jonesing and getting sicker and sicker...

14:43.473 --> 14:46.164
and then all that remorse
is gonna start coming on you...

14:46.232 --> 14:49.176
you are definitely gonna be a candidate
for some guard at Rikers...

14:49.250 --> 14:51.295
finding you hanging in your cell.

14:51.368 --> 14:55.153
Just-Just leave me alone
for a little while, man.

14:55.219 --> 14:57.592
And then what?

14:57.658 --> 15:00.831
And then I'll talk to you.

15:04.108 --> 15:07.116
I don't wanna hear nothin'
about not seein' her for two days, Billy.

15:07.189 --> 15:10.133
- No, man.
- So we understand each other, right?

15:10.206 --> 15:13.564
Just give me a minute, man.

15:22.080 --> 15:25.122
How'd I do?

15:29.429 --> 15:33.052
Hey, Russell and Lesniak checked in.
They're still with the Crime Scene unit.

15:33.120 --> 15:36.063
Oh, yeah. We talked
to this bartender over at Bellevue.

15:36.136 --> 15:39.824
He says he's taking a leak, he hears a bunch
of shoutin', comes out of the bathroom...

15:39.891 --> 15:44.126
and sees this bouncer gettin' his face beat in
by a bald guy big as an elephant.

15:44.191 --> 15:48.645
Yeah. Another guy's backing the bald guy's play,
which the bartender recognizes.

15:48.717 --> 15:52.273
- A biker named Pig.
- And he didn't recognize the bald guy?

15:52.344 --> 15:55.517
No, no. But he says this Pig rolls
with the Lobos, this biker club over on Third.

15:55.585 --> 15:59.338
- So you wanna pick him up?
- Oh, yeah. We can't wait.

15:59.403 --> 16:02.226
I'll get you some backup.

16:04.860 --> 16:06.906
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Lieu.

16:06.978 --> 16:09.473
- Where are you with your interview?
- Okay.

16:09.545 --> 16:12.423
- Guy's thinkin' about it.
- 'Cause Greg and James have to pick up a biker.

16:12.498 --> 16:14.511
Do we know if he's on steroids?

16:15.643 --> 16:18.105
- Hi, Son.
- Hey, Andy.

16:18.178 --> 16:22.118
- Lieutenant, I'm sorry to interrupt.
- Want us to help?

16:22.190 --> 16:26.195
- Yeah. Please.
- No problem on lunch. You wanna try again tomorrow?

16:26.265 --> 16:28.573
- Yeah. Walk out with me here.
- Okay.

16:31.400 --> 16:34.508
I don't want my boss to hear this,
but maybe you can give us a hand with this.

16:34.577 --> 16:36.525
Sure.

16:36.599 --> 16:40.057
- What's in the bag?
- My cop's uniform.

16:40.130 --> 16:43.073
Yeah, huh?

16:44.365 --> 16:46.411
Watch out for that.

17:01.054 --> 17:04.413
Just stay behind me
and keep your ears open.

17:04.488 --> 17:08.272
Description's a guy about 6'4",
mustache and beard.

17:08.339 --> 17:10.614
That narrows it down.
He answers to Pig?

17:10.682 --> 17:13.078
- That's his name. I don't know ifhe answers.
- Hey, where you goin'?

17:13.153 --> 17:15.329
- What do you care?
- Get over here.

17:15.397 --> 17:17.641
- They call you Pig?
- His name is Ernie.

17:17.710 --> 17:20.367
- Let's take a ride, Ernie. We gotta talk to you.
- I ain't goin' nowhere.

17:20.436 --> 17:22.964
We do this right here in the street,
and you're gonna wind up hurt, okay?

17:23.037 --> 17:26.276
- Put down that wrench. - Is he under
arrest? - What's that to you, asshole?

17:26.343 --> 17:28.323
- I got nothin' to say to you.
- We are not gonna do it like this.

17:28.396 --> 17:31.121
We're gonna talk about it in the station house.
You do it right, nobody gets hurt here.

17:31.189 --> 17:35.872
- Not if you don't want to, Pig.
- Dick face, Pig don't come in, we toss your clubhouse.

17:35.938 --> 17:38.564
- Wanna toss it, Andy?
- We gonna find any reefer in there, any swag?

17:38.634 --> 17:43.252
- What's it gonna be, Ernie?
- Jerry-Jerry, it's cool, okay? Okay. Let's go.

17:43.319 --> 17:45.748
What was your probable cause?
You would've lost your search in court.

17:45.823 --> 17:47.934
Yeah. We'd have lost it in court,
but meanwhile...

17:48.005 --> 17:50.281
your buddies would've
lost their goods and their smoke.

17:50.348 --> 17:54.418
Stick with tricycles, F. Lee.
You got no future in bikes.

17:54.488 --> 17:57.365
Charlie Manson, goofy-lookin'...

18:07.453 --> 18:10.144
Now you'll interrogate this guy?

18:10.213 --> 18:11.942
- Martinez and Medavoy, they caught the case.
- Pig, we're here.

18:13.582 --> 18:15.825
- You wanna watch an interrogation?
- I'd get in the way.

18:15.894 --> 18:19.067
No, no. Bobby and me,
we're talking to this kid on another case.

18:19.135 --> 18:21.345
- Yeah, there's an observation room, Andy.
- Yeah. Okay.

18:21.414 --> 18:24.904
We like this kid
for killin' his aunt.

18:24.975 --> 18:28.050
We were in with him once.
He'll probably go this time.

18:32.165 --> 18:34.823
Come on inside.

18:41.311 --> 18:44.703
You're startin'to come down, huh?

18:45.997 --> 18:48.787
- Want some aspirin?
- I'm all right.

18:52.319 --> 18:55.590
So we ready
to take some responsibility here, Billy?

18:55.656 --> 18:59.464
I was supposed to do some wall work
for her yesterday, but I didn't get there...

18:59.539 --> 19:03.894
so I stayed up all night
so I could make it this morning.

19:03.968 --> 19:06.178
- Just to get to your Aunt Etta's place?
- Yeah.

19:06.247 --> 19:09.004
- I got there about 830.
- What happened? Was your aunt mad...

19:09.071 --> 19:11.828
because you messed up yesterday?

19:11.894 --> 19:14.520
I walked in, and she was dead.

19:14.590 --> 19:16.538
I just turned around and ran.

19:16.612 --> 19:19.008
This is how you take responsibility?
Who you think you're talkin' to?

19:19.084 --> 19:21.130
You had her jewelry
in your pocket.

19:21.202 --> 19:23.379
You think you can
piss in my ear and tell me it's rainin'?

19:23.448 --> 19:26.555
- You got blood on your sleeve.
- You start talkin' like a man in here...

19:26.626 --> 19:28.770
or I'm gonna start kickin' ass.

19:32.659 --> 19:37.561
She loved me, and I robbed her.

19:37.634 --> 19:40.807
- I put a bag over her head so she couldn't see me stealin'.
- All right.

19:40.875 --> 19:43.435
- So what led up to that?
- I don't know.

19:43.506 --> 19:46.297
Somebody killed her.

19:46.362 --> 19:50.302
You see, this is like
you killin'her again...

19:50.374 --> 19:52.584
you sittin' here Iyin' to me.

19:52.652 --> 19:56.045
I am not gonna let you kill her again, Billy!
You don't get to kill her twice.

19:56.119 --> 19:58.646
- What difference does it make?
- Meaning what?

19:58.718 --> 20:01.245
Meaning, whatever you say,
it don't matter...

20:01.317 --> 20:04.425
- Meaning what?
- I'll say whatever you want me to say.

20:04.494 --> 20:07.569
- Just tell me what you want me to write.
- We want the truth, Billy.

20:07.639 --> 20:09.817
Did you kill your aunt?
Did you take a hammer to her?

20:09.886 --> 20:12.194
- Whatever you say.
- Not whatever I say! Whatever you say.

20:12.261 --> 20:17.426
All right, all right!
I killed her! All right? I killed her! L...

20:21.600 --> 20:24.609
- Oh, God.
- You ready to give a statement?

20:26.478 --> 20:28.623
- I just did.
- I'm talkin'about a written statement.

20:28.693 --> 20:31.735
Are you ready to give a statement?
We'll get a D.A.

20:31.805 --> 20:34.146
Yeah.

20:37.967 --> 20:42.870
We can get you some kind of treatment.
Maybe the D.A. Could help you with that. Come on.

20:57.094 --> 20:59.490
Sarah Bernhardt.

20:59.566 --> 21:03.604
Goes for putting a bag over her head
but won't admit to killing her?

21:03.674 --> 21:07.744
He went there.
He's gonna go for it.

21:07.813 --> 21:09.607
- Here comes your lieutenant.
- You're okay.

21:09.675 --> 21:13.778
Latent got a blood print on the D.O.A.'s doorknob.
They're checking it against your guy's.

21:13.847 --> 21:17.786
And a uniform's bringing a Leon Broadus in,
who tried to cash one of the D.O.A. 's checks.

21:17.859 --> 21:20.036
Bank manager couldn't tell
if it was forged.

21:20.104 --> 21:22.665
- This kid, he's ready to write, talk to a D.A.
- So that's good.

21:22.736 --> 21:25.610
He admits to robbing her things.
He's only gonna go for the homicide...

21:25.681 --> 21:28.756
'cause he's sick and the world's such a sad place,
but that he really didn't do it.

21:28.826 --> 21:31.551
She was dead when he got to her place.
Somebody already took a hammer to her.

21:31.618 --> 21:34.474
Which we think is crap?

21:34.538 --> 21:36.399
- Yeah. Probably.
- Probably.

21:36.464 --> 21:39.735
Okay, talk to this guy that tried
to cash the check before you bring in a D.A.

21:39.801 --> 21:43.292
I can't authorize overtime
for you, AndyJr.

21:45.578 --> 21:48.073
- I'd like to hear on those prints too.
- Yeah.

21:48.146 --> 21:50.225
I'll call Sylvia.
The three of us'll go to lunch.

21:50.296 --> 21:52.309
You said she went
to the doctor?

21:52.382 --> 21:57.252
Yeah, he wanted to examine her.
She's feeling some repositioning going on.

21:57.324 --> 22:01.132
We got a beeper system
worked out here.

22:01.208 --> 22:03.866
You're not sure
that guy in there did it, that Billy?

22:03.935 --> 22:07.841
He probably did it.
He was just feelin' sorry for himself.

22:10.675 --> 22:12.655
Now she'll call back.

22:12.728 --> 22:15.518
See, you don't wanna go to bat, though,
Andy, without following out what you got.

22:15.585 --> 22:18.276
You turn a case over and something new
turns up, you may not look at it right.

22:18.345 --> 22:21.518
If you move the guy and bought his story,
now you may get dug in...

22:21.587 --> 22:23.502
not want to reopen the case,
you know.

22:23.576 --> 22:26.169
Yeah. I see. I see.

22:26.240 --> 22:30.442
Sylvia? Yeah.

22:30.508 --> 22:33.583
No.

22:33.653 --> 22:38.368
Uh, you want me to come home,
bring you some soup?

22:38.435 --> 22:41.608
All right.
Uh, AndyJr. 's here...

22:41.676 --> 22:44.586
so me and Bobby'll
take him out to lunch then.

22:44.661 --> 22:48.446
Yeah. Me too. Bye.

22:49.956 --> 22:52.352
Doc said it wasn't labor?

22:52.427 --> 22:56.213
A few centimeters' dilation,
but no effacement.

22:56.278 --> 22:58.969
Guy must charge by the word.

23:00.161 --> 23:05.391
- I appreciate this.
- Hey, Andy, we like it too.

23:26.221 --> 23:29.295
- Several messages, Detective.
- What's goin' on?

23:29.366 --> 23:32.758
Fingerprint technician Mulcahey
from B.C.I. Left word...

23:32.832 --> 23:36.290
your suspect's fingerprints and the blood print
lifted by the Crime Scene unit...

23:36.362 --> 23:38.189
from the doorknob
at your D.O.A.'s residence are not a match.

23:38.256 --> 23:42.326
- Wow.
- Also, there was a minor traffic accident...

23:42.395 --> 23:44.474
involving the sector cop
bringing in Leon Broadus.

23:44.545 --> 23:47.850
- That's the guy that might've forged a check from our D.O.A.
- They'd have him here in 10.

23:47.915 --> 23:53.146
- Nothing from my wife?
- I'd have given you that first.

23:53.210 --> 23:55.453
Thanks, Donna.

23:58.153 --> 24:02.508
This Broadus is clean with B.C.I.
We gotta get him to give up his fingerprints.

24:02.581 --> 24:04.824
- Is that gonna make him get a lawyer?
- You find a way...

24:04.892 --> 24:07.003
to make him think
he's gettin' over on ya.

24:07.075 --> 24:09.318
Make him think
instead ofhelpin'you, he's helpin'himself.

24:09.385 --> 24:13.357
Reluctant as you may be to engage in deception.

24:16.317 --> 24:19.042
- Hi, James.
- Hey.

24:19.109 --> 24:22.085
- I was hoping we could find time later on to talk.
- Not right now.

24:22.158 --> 24:25.298
- Me and Greg gotta interview this guy we picked up.
- That guy Pig?

24:25.367 --> 24:30.018
Yeah. See if he'll flip on his running buddy.
Greg's already in there with him.

24:30.085 --> 24:32.908
Well, I don't mean to
put you on the spot, James.

24:32.973 --> 24:36.464
- I was just hoping later on, we'd find time.
- Absolutely.

24:36.535 --> 24:39.927
Definitely. You know,
um, I gotta go talk to this Pig.

24:44.174 --> 24:47.412
Could I, uh,
impose on you to ask a question?

24:47.479 --> 24:50.969
- Oh, hi, Donna.
- Um, this could sound kind of silly...

24:51.041 --> 24:54.050
but have you ever resided
out of state?

24:54.122 --> 24:57.930
Yeah. I lived two years in Boston
when my father's mother was sick.

24:58.006 --> 25:02.558
- How old were you?
- Four when we moved there, so I really don't remember it well.

25:02.627 --> 25:04.870
I see. I've, um...

25:04.937 --> 25:09.041
thought very informally
about relocating...

25:09.110 --> 25:12.732
but I've pretty much decided
it's not realistic given who I am.

25:12.800 --> 25:15.875
I'm sure you'll make the right choice.

25:16.875 --> 25:19.053
So how are things with you?

25:19.122 --> 25:21.070
Okay.

25:22.524 --> 25:27.656
- I guess it never runs smooth, huh?
- I guess not.

25:39.116 --> 25:42.989
See, that time frame we're interested in,
Ernie here states he was home watching TV.

25:43.064 --> 25:45.405
Yeah? Something educational, Ernie?

25:45.470 --> 25:48.993
Yeah, I suggested possibly Ernie's confused
since the eyewitness we got...

25:49.065 --> 25:52.303
puts him at this titty bar at that juncture
watchin' a bouncer get beat to death.

25:52.370 --> 25:56.091
- You don't know that, man.
- Hey, Pig, the bouncer died, but the bartender made it.

25:56.157 --> 25:59.713
He looks like a smashed tomato, but he pulled
through. We had a chat with him at Bellevue.

25:59.784 --> 26:03.340
- He says he saw you, Pig.
- I wasn't there. I was watchin' TV.

26:03.410 --> 26:07.098
Pig, a homicide during a felony
means the D.A. Don't need premeditation.

26:07.165 --> 26:10.820
They're gonna look to inject you.

26:10.887 --> 26:13.995
All's I did was walk into a bar.
I was supposed to watch a guy's back.

26:14.065 --> 26:18.070
- While he did what?
- This guy was in Attica till last week.

26:18.140 --> 26:21.313
- The bouncer's banging his old lady.
- Put a name to this guy.

26:22.697 --> 26:24.645
Jay Dolinky.

26:24.719 --> 26:27.542
But robbery had nothin' to do with it.
There was no extra felony, okay?

26:27.607 --> 26:29.588
Nah. Jay just wanted
to beat the guy to death.

26:29.662 --> 26:32.485
All's he said is he's gonna kick this guy's ass,
for me to watch his back.

26:32.550 --> 26:36.818
Then he goes berserk, and he kills the one guy.
Then he went off on the bartender too.

26:36.882 --> 26:39.672
- Where we gonna find Jay, Pig?
- I don't know.

26:39.739 --> 26:43.010
- What about the ex-girlfriend?
- I don't know that either. She dances at the bar.

26:43.076 --> 26:45.319
- He was lookin' for her address there.
- Did he find it?

26:45.388 --> 26:47.598
He could've.

26:47.666 --> 26:51.156
He was still workin' out
on those two guys when I split.

26:51.228 --> 26:54.816
We'll get the address from that jerk
that runs the place. Come on.

26:54.886 --> 26:58.158
- Sit still, Pig.
- Hey, could I get out of this?

26:58.224 --> 27:01.167
Well, we grabJay up, you tell
what he did in court, and we'll see...

27:01.241 --> 27:04.994
if we can keep you amongst the rest
of the decent citizens.

27:07.755 --> 27:10.578
- You're, uh, Leon Broadus?
- Yeah.

27:10.644 --> 27:13.434
I'm Detective Simone.

27:13.500 --> 27:16.291
She give me that check
for some carpentry.

27:16.356 --> 27:20.777
- We talkin' about Etta Stubbs?
- Yeah, yeah.

27:20.850 --> 27:24.088
You been drinkin', Leon?

27:24.155 --> 27:26.201
- So what?
- Nothin'. I'm jealous.

27:26.273 --> 27:29.064
So you did some work for Miss Stubbs?

27:29.129 --> 27:31.558
Yeah, I did some wall work,
and I fixed her closet door.

27:31.633 --> 27:35.320
- When was it that you did this work for her?
- I finished up yesterday.

27:35.387 --> 27:40.487
She said to wait to cash it.
That's why the date was today.

27:40.554 --> 27:43.859
- So you're saying you picked up the check today?
- I picked it up yesterday.

27:43.924 --> 27:46.232
She dated it for today.

27:46.299 --> 27:49.604
You know Miss Stubbs
was murdered.

27:49.669 --> 27:52.743
- I wasn't over there.
- You were over there yesterday.

27:52.814 --> 27:55.757
- Yeah, but not today.
- Where were you this morning, Leon?

27:55.830 --> 27:57.908
- The St. Nick.
- Over on Fourth Street?

27:57.981 --> 28:00.409
- Yeah.
- What time you get there?

28:00.484 --> 28:02.760
Maybe 8:00.

28:02.826 --> 28:05.966
I sweep up over there.
I bring in the cans.

28:06.036 --> 28:10.784
- Bartender, he open up with you?
- He gets in at 9:00.

28:10.850 --> 28:13.312
So how was it that you came
to work for Miss Stubbs?

28:13.385 --> 28:18.156
I work for colored, white.
It makes no difference to me.

28:18.231 --> 28:22.433
- Okay.
- I put my number up on that mailbox...

28:22.499 --> 28:24.677
all on that street.

28:24.746 --> 28:28.586
She told me that her nephew was supposed
to come help her...

28:28.661 --> 28:31.484
but he kept not showing up.

28:31.550 --> 28:35.237
You and her have an argument, maybe
something about her postdating that check?

28:35.304 --> 28:39.276
She told me to wait
to cash it till today.

28:45.253 --> 28:48.295
You do any work
in Miss Stubbs's bedroom, Leon?

28:48.366 --> 28:50.762
- Her bedroom?
- Yeah. The bedroom.

28:50.837 --> 28:52.948
- No.
- What about that bathroom off the bedroom?

28:53.019 --> 28:56.860
- You ever do any work in there?
- I was never in the bedroom.

28:56.935 --> 29:00.557
'Cause we got some prints
off the medicine cabinet in the bathroom.

29:00.625 --> 29:03.219
Must've been from the guy
that killed her.

29:03.289 --> 29:07.457
You know, maybe-
maybe that was her nephew.

29:07.526 --> 29:12.395
- What makes you say that?
- I just know that she said that he done some jobs for her...

29:12.467 --> 29:16.570
but, then,
I was never in that part of it.

29:16.640 --> 29:19.682
Right. Well, you know,
they'll take the hold off the check...

29:19.752 --> 29:22.378
once they've established that it wasn't
your prints on that medicine cabinet.

29:23.828 --> 29:26.487
Do we have your prints
on file for any reason?

29:26.556 --> 29:28.832
- No. Uh-uh. No.
- Okay. I tell you what, Leon.

29:28.899 --> 29:33.647
Let's take some prints from you real quick.
That way, we rule you out.

29:33.713 --> 29:37.072
- My boss, he gets off my back.
- All right.

29:37.147 --> 29:40.221
Make sure I give them back once we run the check.
Otherwise, they'll be in the computer.

29:40.292 --> 29:44.077
- You don't want that.
- Hey, I was never in that part of the apartment.

29:44.143 --> 29:49.461
You remind me, though, 'cause I'm gettin'
to where I'd lose my head if it wasn't attached.

29:49.535 --> 29:51.395
- Yeah. Okay.
- Let's go downstairs and do this.

29:51.460 --> 29:54.086
Yeah.

30:09.143 --> 30:12.152
- Yeah?
- Miss Archer, detectives.

30:12.224 --> 30:15.529
Your employer, Mr. Delva,
gave us your address.

30:15.593 --> 30:18.351
- Yeah.
- We need to ask you some questions.

30:20.889 --> 30:24.160
- Questions about what?
- We were told you dated a guy named Jay Dolinky.

30:24.226 --> 30:26.174
- He went away to prison.
- I haven't seen him.

30:26.248 --> 30:29.487
- Did you know he's out of jail?
- No.

30:29.554 --> 30:33.209
You know this Carl Maclntyre, right?
He's who you're dating now?

30:33.276 --> 30:35.519
He was just a guy
keepin' me company.

30:35.587 --> 30:37.961
Oh, you said was."
You're not seein' him anymore?

30:38.027 --> 30:40.685
I was never really
seein' him at all.

30:40.754 --> 30:44.507
- These yours?
- No. They're my sister's boyfriend's.

30:44.573 --> 30:47.231
- She around?
- No.

30:47.301 --> 30:51.722
If you're withholding information on this guy,
that puts you in the middle.

30:51.794 --> 30:55.897
I talked toJay once on the telephone
since he's been out and told 'im we're through.

30:55.966 --> 30:58.340
- That's all I know.
- Carl Maclntyre...

30:58.405 --> 31:00.615
the bouncer you were
only keeping company with?

31:00.683 --> 31:04.042
- He's dead now.
- I haven't talked toJay.

31:04.118 --> 31:07.510
So this Jay goes off on a homicide spree
just off a phone call?

31:07.583 --> 31:09.826
Hey, you're the one
makin' all the connections, all right?

31:09.894 --> 31:11.973
I don't know if he had anything
to do with Carl.

31:12.044 --> 31:16.114
- I don't know if he had anything to do with anything.
- What's in here, huh?

31:18.013 --> 31:22.849
Back off! Back off! I'm walkin' out of here,
or her head's comin' off, man!

31:22.924 --> 31:25.386
- Take it easy. Don't hurt the girl.
- Don't do nothin' stupid.

31:25.459 --> 31:28.851
No way I'm goin' back to jail!
No way! No way!

31:28.925 --> 31:31.353
- You hurt the girl, you're gonna die today.
- Son of a bitch!

31:31.429 --> 31:36.528
You wild bastard!

31:36.595 --> 31:39.768
I'll get the gun.

31:39.837 --> 31:42.397
- You okay?
- Yeah.

31:42.468 --> 31:47.184
- He's not.
- I'll call E.M.S.

31:57.038 --> 31:59.861
- Hey.
- Hey. Heard you had quite an adventure.

31:59.926 --> 32:02.486
Yeah. Our guy's downstairs in holding.

32:02.558 --> 32:05.118
Well, everyone's in holding patterns
for interview rooms.

32:05.189 --> 32:08.712
- That kid Billy's up in your crib.
- Hope he don't rearrange things.

32:08.784 --> 32:11.125
I'll let you know
when an interview room opens up.

32:11.191 --> 32:13.719
- Hey, nice goin', guys.
- Yeah.

32:13.791 --> 32:16.668
It was somethin', Lieu. I mean,
that guy come out of that bedroom like Dillinger.

32:16.743 --> 32:19.237
The girl who hits him
wants to take the entrance exam for the job.

32:19.311 --> 32:22.133
- I bet.
- She just about knocked him cold with an ashtray.

32:22.199 --> 32:24.627
Okay. Yeah. Thanks a lot.

32:24.702 --> 32:27.842
- Handyman's our guy.
- Is that right?

32:27.911 --> 32:32.431
B.C.I. Says the prints he gave you is a match
with the blood prints on the doorknob.

32:32.500 --> 32:35.673
Lieu, the nephew- He didn't do it.
It was this guy Broadus.

32:35.741 --> 32:39.779
- So what else are you holding the nephew for?
- Trying to steal a camera.

32:39.849 --> 32:42.190
Your call on letting him go.
Try to move the handyman.

32:42.257 --> 32:46.042
You're not confident a jury'll
convict off conclusive blood evidence?

32:46.108 --> 32:49.413
- You want me to wait till
you're through with the nephew?

32:49.477 --> 32:52.168
No. Get started.

32:52.237 --> 32:55.060
Diane, if he's not bumping
into the boss...

32:55.126 --> 32:58.168
when AndyJ. Gets back, you wanna tell him
to go to the observation room?

32:58.239 --> 33:00.154
- All right.
- Thanks.

33:02.956 --> 33:05.786
- I'm glad you weren't hurt picking that guy up.
- Yeah.

33:05.859 --> 33:08.934
Got a little exciting out there.

33:14.010 --> 33:17.248
Should we have that talk, Adrianne?

33:17.316 --> 33:19.974
Well, I've wanted to since
you were staying at your parents' house...

33:20.043 --> 33:23.282
and then when you agreed today,
I sat here thinking, you know...

33:23.349 --> 33:25.362
why should I make you
put it into words?

33:25.435 --> 33:30.053
I mean, it's pretty clear that you don't want us
keeping company any longer.

33:30.120 --> 33:34.060
Yeah, that's accurate-
you know, how things worked out.

33:34.132 --> 33:37.240
- I'm very sorry.
- I am as well.

33:37.309 --> 33:41.150
I wanted to open my heart,
I wanted to make you happy...

33:41.225 --> 33:44.650
but instead,
I was possessive and suspicious.

33:44.723 --> 33:48.958
- Why do you think that happened?
- Maybe it's in my family.

33:50.211 --> 33:53.187
- My father's like that with my mom.
- Yeah.

33:53.260 --> 33:58.457
It seems like most of the guys you went out
with were like that- all but me.

34:00.127 --> 34:04.099
- I feel like such a failure.
- Don't say that, Adrianne.

34:04.171 --> 34:09.040
I'd ask for another chance to change,
but I made promises to myself repeatedly...

34:09.112 --> 34:13.053
when we were going out,
and the next day I'd act the same.

34:13.125 --> 34:16.648
Adrianne, don't beat yourself up.
I'm always gonna be your friend.

34:16.719 --> 34:19.148
Same here, James.

34:20.185 --> 34:23.260
So, I guess we had our talk.

34:23.330 --> 34:26.722
At least we didn't
break any crockery.

34:26.795 --> 34:30.484
- That's different than my parents.
- Yeah.

34:33.600 --> 34:36.193
Hey, come here.

34:36.263 --> 34:38.726
Hold my hand.

34:50.994 --> 34:54.418
- He's sick.
- Give me a minute with him.

34:58.889 --> 35:02.194
- How you feelin', Billy?
- I'm all right.

35:08.003 --> 35:11.144
We found out you were
telling the truth, Billy.

35:12.496 --> 35:15.571
It was some handyman
that killed your aunt.

35:17.824 --> 35:20.614
Yeah. I just robbed her.

35:20.679 --> 35:23.984
We're not gonna file charges.
That camera we caught you boostin', we'll just...

35:24.049 --> 35:27.288
return that as found property.

35:28.991 --> 35:34.091
It's your aunt's jewelry. You can
get her buried, see to her arrangements...

35:35.699 --> 35:38.456
or you can put it up your arm.

35:38.523 --> 35:40.668
I can go now?

35:42.856 --> 35:47.145
Hey, do the right thing,
man, all right?

35:47.220 --> 35:51.904
You come back after the funeral,
and I'll get you in a program.

35:53.639 --> 35:58.475
- I'm a junkie.
- Who do you think are in those programs?

35:58.549 --> 36:02.816
Afterwards, some of'em are ex-junkies.

36:22.683 --> 36:26.238
I know you're gonna
follow this soon, Leon.

36:26.309 --> 36:30.729
What Detective Simone said to you, that we
found prints on the bedroom medicine cabinet...

36:30.802 --> 36:34.424
No, he said that
that was the only place you were lookin'...

36:34.493 --> 36:37.020
that my prints would get compared.

36:37.092 --> 36:42.028
And what
I'm trying to get you to understand...

36:42.099 --> 36:45.754
That detective could've told you
that we were only lookin'on Neptune.

36:45.821 --> 36:48.611
What he said
we wanted those prints for, it don't matter.

36:48.678 --> 36:52.813
But I cooperated
based on that detective Iyin' to me.

36:52.882 --> 36:55.540
I thought you were
pickin' up your uniform from the tailors.

36:55.609 --> 36:57.524
Yeah. He's gonna
shorten the sleeves a little.

36:57.599 --> 37:02.250
Him misleading you on those prints,
that's called permissible deception, Leon.

37:02.317 --> 37:05.107
We in law enforcement,
we're allowed to do that...

37:05.173 --> 37:10.491
when an innocent guy wouldn't be harmed
and a suspect's enough of a moron to go for it.

37:10.565 --> 37:14.372
You qualify.
The print in the woman's blood's yours.

37:14.447 --> 37:18.770
You had it on your hands. You killed her!

37:18.845 --> 37:20.738
911." This is it.

37:20.802 --> 37:23.111
What are you guys pullin' now, huh?

37:23.177 --> 37:25.934
You stay there.
Sylvia beeped 911."

37:26.001 --> 37:27.916
- Go ahead. I'll close this guy.
- He knows about the blood.

37:27.991 --> 37:30.584
He's almost done pissin' and moanin'
at how he got tricked into givin' up his prints.

37:30.654 --> 37:32.864
You got him. I was watching in observation.
You wanna ride with your dad?

37:32.934 --> 37:35.045
- You want I should ride with you, Pop?
- You wanna take a ride with me?

37:35.115 --> 37:37.030
Let's go.

37:38.678 --> 37:40.592
Donna, could you
sign me out to the hospital?

37:40.668 --> 37:43.041
- Sylvia beeped 911."
- Sure, Detective.

37:43.107 --> 37:44.967
- And you'll tell the boss? - Here
we go. - I'll have a good thought.

37:45.032 --> 37:47.242
Come on, Andy. We're in a rush.

37:47.311 --> 37:50.418
- I'll tell Fancy.
- Thanks very much.

37:50.488 --> 37:52.763
15th Squad.

37:52.831 --> 37:56.223
How are you, Mr. Comstock?

37:56.296 --> 38:00.498
Uh, well, thank you,
but as regards your offer...

38:00.565 --> 38:03.672
I'm very appreciative,
but I'm going to decline.

38:03.742 --> 38:07.911
It's a combination of factors.

38:07.978 --> 38:12.694
I've never heard that- relocation remorse"-
but that is an element.

38:14.140 --> 38:16.897
I guess there'd be no harm in that.

38:16.965 --> 38:21.768
Tonight's not possible. I have a season-long
commitment to the New York Rangers.

38:21.842 --> 38:24.085
Really?

38:24.153 --> 38:26.549
Uh, all right.

38:26.624 --> 38:29.282
I'll see you between the first
and second periods...

38:29.352 --> 38:32.842
just where the Zambonis
leave the ice.

38:32.914 --> 38:35.957
All right, sir. Mm-hmm.

38:47.644 --> 38:49.242
- Excuse me.
- Andy.

38:49.313 --> 38:52.136
- Sylvia, where you goin'?
- The delivery room.

38:52.202 --> 38:55.987
- Where's your doctor?
- He's got a forceps delivery. He'll be comin' right over.

38:56.053 --> 38:58.296
- This is my husband, Andy.
- Jane Mackey.

38:58.364 --> 39:00.826
- That's my son, AndyJr. -
Hi, AndyJr. - How's it goin'?

39:00.899 --> 39:05.068
- Good. You know, my brother's a cop in the 27.
- Eddie Mackey? Heavyset guy?

39:05.135 --> 39:07.860
- That's him.
- Detective.

39:07.927 --> 39:10.203
Sylvia's progressing a little faster
than we expected, but, uh...

39:10.270 --> 39:12.546
that sometimes happens
with older primips.

39:12.612 --> 39:15.370
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.
- Women past 30...

39:15.437 --> 39:17.297
having their first child.

39:17.363 --> 39:20.240
- Here comes a contraction!
- We're gonna set her up in here, see where we stand...

39:20.314 --> 39:22.360
and then you can come in
and be with her.

39:22.433 --> 39:25.442
- You okay?
- I'll be fine... after I have an epidural!

39:25.514 --> 39:30.066
She wants- She needs her epidural!

39:30.136 --> 39:34.206
- What's an epidural?
- I don't like this guy's attitude.

39:34.275 --> 39:37.831
- What? The doctor? He's fine.
- Jewish guy. They talk to you like you're seven.

39:37.901 --> 39:40.079
- She's got confidence in him. That's the main thing.
- Pop, take it easy.

39:40.148 --> 39:42.971
She's got confidence in him.
That's all I care...

39:43.036 --> 39:45.827
- Whoa. Where are you going?
- I'm Dr. Zisk. I'm the anesthesiologist.

39:45.893 --> 39:48.683
- Uh-uh. My wife's in there.
- I'm gonna give her an epidural.

39:48.749 --> 39:52.371
Uh, yeah, go ahead.
She was askin'for that.

39:52.439 --> 39:54.518
Go ahead.

39:54.590 --> 39:57.697
I'm okay. I'm right here, hon.

39:57.767 --> 40:01.870
Must be a type of pain procedure.

40:01.939 --> 40:07.224
Oh, brother.
They must need an epidural down there.

40:07.298 --> 40:11.336
Okay, Detective. Let's get you gowned up.
You wanna come with me?

40:11.406 --> 40:14.929
- Did you talk to your wife about your son being present?
- No.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.721
- I'll just wait outside.
- You just have to put on a gown if you want to be in the room.

40:18.787 --> 40:20.680
- I'll be fine outside.
- All right. Well, let's go.

40:20.745 --> 40:22.605
- Where we going?
- Down here.

40:22.671 --> 40:27.441
Guard the door there.
Andy, stand guard.

40:31.240 --> 40:33.417
- He's a handsome boy.
- Gonna be a cop.

40:33.486 --> 40:37.589
- Oh, yeah? Good for him.
- They're callin' for you, Pop. They said the baby's comin'.

40:37.658 --> 40:40.798
- Let's go.
- Don't forget your hat.

40:40.867 --> 40:42.760
That's it. That's it.

40:42.825 --> 40:47.573
Big progress, Sylvia. Beautiful. Beautiful.

40:47.639 --> 40:50.997
- What's goin'on?
- I feel so much better, Andy.

40:51.072 --> 40:53.983
Your wife is like a peasant woman.
She's just about to deliver.

40:54.057 --> 40:57.295
- Here comes another one.
- Come on, sweetie. Push...

40:57.363 --> 41:01.597
two, three, four, five, six.

41:01.663 --> 41:04.541
That's it. That's it.

41:04.616 --> 41:07.471
- And he's crowning.
- You can see the top of his head.

41:07.536 --> 41:10.676
- Push.
- That's it. That's it.

41:10.745 --> 41:13.656
- Okay. Good.
- Two, three, four.

41:13.730 --> 41:15.973
This is the one, Sylvia. Push!

41:16.041 --> 41:19.346
Oh, yes. Here he is.

41:21.657 --> 41:23.768
Here's your son, Mr. Sipowicz.

41:23.839 --> 41:27.144
- It's a boy.
- I wanna hold him. I wanna hold him.

41:27.209 --> 41:30.831
- Oh, yes.
- Dad, you wanna cut the cord?

41:30.899 --> 41:32.945
No.

41:47.235 --> 41:49.762
And here comes the placenta.

41:49.834 --> 41:52.975
And we have a gush.

41:53.043 --> 41:55.833
- She's hemorrhaging.
- What's going on?

41:55.900 --> 41:58.328
- Go away, Mr. Sipowicz, please.
- Seventy over 50. - Thank you.

41:58.403 --> 42:02.025
- What's going on?
- Turn up the fluids.

42:02.094 --> 42:05.682
- Make sure she's not too crossed.
- How's my wife?

42:05.752 --> 42:08.728
I'm gonna shock the uterus
to stop the bleeding.

42:08.800 --> 42:10.661
What the hell is-
What are you talkin' about here?

42:10.726 --> 42:13.155
Sylvia? Sylvia?

42:13.230 --> 42:16.818
- Okay. Got it.
- Pressure has stabilized.

42:16.888 --> 42:18.803
That's a girl.

42:18.878 --> 42:21.187
You're okay.

42:21.253 --> 42:26.155
- What happened? What happened?
- You hemorrhaged, but everything's under control.

42:26.227 --> 42:30.680
- Is the baby okay?
- Absolutely. Everybody's fine.

42:30.752 --> 42:33.247
I wanna hold him.
I wanna hold the baby.

42:33.320 --> 42:37.073
Here we come.
Here we come.

42:37.138 --> 42:39.830
- All right.
- There you go.

42:39.899 --> 42:42.754
Oh.

42:42.819 --> 42:45.314
- Oh, wow.
- That's it.

42:45.386 --> 42:48.559
Here he is, Andy. Here he is.

42:50.970 --> 42:56.003
- Oh, I know.
- Hey, hey, hey.

43:00.855 --> 43:03.098
Hey, pal.

43:13.757 --> 43:18.210
Healthy baby. They're both okay.

43:18.281 --> 43:20.809
That's great, Pop.

43:25.213 --> 43:28.288
I'm gonna be spending more time with him
'cause he's just a little guy...

43:28.358 --> 43:31.783
but don't think
I love you no less.
