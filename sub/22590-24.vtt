<i>NARRATOR".
Night over Gotham City.</i>

00:12.597 --> 00:14.557
<i>But what else is over Gotham City?</i>

00:14.724 --> 00:16.809
<i>Not flying saucers.</i>

00:17.310 --> 00:21.272
I'm sorry, sir,
but we know nothing about it at all.

00:23.274 --> 00:27.654
I'm sorry, but we have absolutely
no information, madam.

00:28.988 --> 00:32.116
Yes? I'm sorry, but--

00:32.283 --> 00:35.411
An imminent invasion from outer space?
Ha, ha.

00:35.578 --> 00:38.540
Well, I rather doubt it, miss.

00:39.332 --> 00:44.003
Bonnie, please, hold the rest of the calls.
I can't talk to all of Gotham City tonight.

00:44.170 --> 00:45.797
Yes, commissioner.

00:45.964 --> 00:48.049
<i>But there's a Mrs. Green out here to see you.</i>

00:48.216 --> 00:51.594
<i>Regarding a man from Mars
she just met in Gotham Park.</i>

00:51.761 --> 00:55.306
All right, Bonnie.
Wait a minute, then send her in.

00:56.849 --> 00:58.351
Now, let me get this straight.

00:58.518 --> 01:01.479
You say by week's end,
the invasion will be complete.

01:01.646 --> 01:06.317
And Gotham City will be overcome,
not only by little men from Mars...

01:06.484 --> 01:09.320
...but by virulent living organisms
from outer space?

01:10.863 --> 01:11.906
You can't expect me...

01:12.073 --> 01:16.286
...to take you seriously, Professor Greenleaf.
-I think you should, Ms. Gordon.

01:16.452 --> 01:20.999
And I think your father
should advise all authorities...

01:21.165 --> 01:24.502
...to submit to
and comply with the invaders.

01:24.669 --> 01:26.462
Otherwise...

01:27.964 --> 01:30.008
- What is it?
-Look.

01:30.174 --> 01:31.593
There.

01:37.682 --> 01:40.518
Flying saucers are a myth.

01:40.685 --> 01:44.355
A figment of the whole world's imagination.

01:44.939 --> 01:46.566
But the world's imagination...

01:46.733 --> 01:51.029
...and particularly Gotham City's,
is getting out of hand.

01:51.195 --> 01:56.409
What we need is some experienced help.

<i>But what's this?</i>

03:25.289 --> 03:28.000
<i>NARRATOR".
In an abandoned launching pad factory...</i>

03:28.167 --> 03:32.880
<i>...our old nemesis, the Joker,
up to a sinister sky-born caper.</i>

03:33.047 --> 03:35.508
Joker, you are so marvy!

03:35.675 --> 03:38.845
Oh, I was more than marvy
while I was in prison, Emerald.

03:39.011 --> 03:40.638
I was positively inspired...

03:40.805 --> 03:44.976
...completing these plans for my flying saucer,
with the help of my cellmate...

03:45.143 --> 03:48.604
...a mad scientist who had a passing penchant
for picking pockets.

03:49.981 --> 03:52.900
Plans look great, but what will you use
to build your flying saucer out of?

03:53.067 --> 03:55.445
Oh, don't worry about that, Shamrock.
It'll be made.

03:55.611 --> 03:58.656
And shortly, it'll be speeding
across the skies of Gotham City.

03:58.823 --> 04:00.491
Oh, but not without warning.

04:00.658 --> 04:03.161
Ooh, the rumors I've planted.

04:03.327 --> 04:04.912
Yes, the whispers are flying.

04:05.079 --> 04:08.916
What scuttlebutt is afloat
on my private grapevine.

04:10.251 --> 04:15.673
And, uh, hmm,
just what did this man from Mars...

04:15.840 --> 04:18.509
...say to you in Gotham Park, Mrs. Green?

04:18.676 --> 04:23.514
I don't know. I don't speak Martian,
or Marsish, or whatever you call it.

04:23.681 --> 04:28.186
That's understandable
since there is no life on Mars as we know it.

04:28.352 --> 04:32.440
There can be no intelligible
Marsish language.

04:32.607 --> 04:34.776
Did he threaten you in any manner?

04:34.942 --> 04:38.321
Not exactly threaten me,
but he certainly frightened me.

04:38.488 --> 04:42.241
It's not often I run into a...

04:42.408 --> 04:45.161
It's not often I run into a man 3 feet tall.

04:45.328 --> 04:47.371
- No.
-Three feet tall?

04:47.538 --> 04:51.751
- Holy interplanetary yardstick.
-But he did speak to you?

04:51.959 --> 04:57.048
And then he left
in his flying saucer, Mrs. Green?

04:59.175 --> 05:03.721
- He was out of sight in a split second.
-Mother Machree.

05:03.888 --> 05:07.058
Well, I'm sorry to be so lacking
in details, gentlemen...

05:07.225 --> 05:09.519
...but I thought the incident
should be reported.

05:09.685 --> 05:11.229
Of course, Mrs. Green.

05:11.395 --> 05:13.815
It's the duty of every good citizen
of Gotham City...

05:13.981 --> 05:16.609
...to report meeting a man from Mars
in a public park.

05:16.776 --> 05:19.946
Gotham City Penal Code
Section 32, Subsection 14.

05:20.112 --> 05:23.032
Yes, thank you for coming.

05:24.742 --> 05:27.370
You're welcome. Goodbye, sonny.

05:28.871 --> 05:30.665
Well, Batman?

05:30.832 --> 05:32.500
She seemed composed, intelligent...

05:32.667 --> 05:35.837
...not given to falsehoods or hallucinations.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.840
- And vaguely familiar, commissioner.
-Oh?

05:39.006 --> 05:42.593
Perhaps the Batcomputer
can help our lagging memories.

05:42.760 --> 05:43.928
Let's go, Robin.

05:44.095 --> 05:46.430
Daddy? Daddy.

05:46.597 --> 05:49.934
- What's the matter, Ms. Gordon?
-I barely got out of the library alive.

05:50.101 --> 05:55.857
There was this little green man from Mars,
and he was just scampering all over the place.

06:00.069 --> 06:05.992
<i>NARRATOR". But the library isn't the only place
the little green man is scrambling.</i>

06:30.641 --> 06:33.477
<i>And back in the abandoned
launching pad factory...</i>

06:33.644 --> 06:36.939
And scared Commissioner Gordon's daughter
half to death in the library?

06:37.106 --> 06:41.068
While your sister, Mrs. Green,
was equally effective at police headquarters?

06:42.862 --> 06:46.157
Oh, thank you, Professor Greenleaf,
for a job well done.

06:46.324 --> 06:50.161
You'll both certainly earn
your greenbacks tonight.

06:50.828 --> 06:55.458
All of Gotham City has the flying saucer jitters.
And when they see my flying saucer--

06:55.625 --> 06:58.169
How are they gonna see it
if you don't start making it?

06:58.336 --> 07:02.298
Oh, it can be assembled in a matter of hours,
Shamrock. As soon as we get the beryllium.

07:02.465 --> 07:03.591
What is that, poopsie?

07:03.758 --> 07:06.010
One of the lightest metals
in the world, Emerald.

07:06.177 --> 07:10.848
Yes, and the Wayne Foundation is currently
doing research on a huge supply of it.

07:11.015 --> 07:14.560
So we heist this beryllium,
build your saucer and off we go?

07:14.727 --> 07:15.853
No, Chartreuse.

07:16.020 --> 07:18.147
Here we come. From another planet.

07:19.649 --> 07:21.734
Terrorizing the inhabitants
of Gotham City...

07:21.901 --> 07:25.404
...and forcing them and the rest
of the world's population to their knees...

07:25.571 --> 07:29.408
...with the demands I shall issue
from my awe-inspiring spaceship.

07:30.868 --> 07:33.871
What are those demands
going to be, poopsie?

07:34.038 --> 07:37.917
Well, what would any
green-haired Martian demand, Emerald?

07:38.084 --> 07:42.046
Complete capitulation,
complete cooperation, complete control.

07:42.213 --> 07:45.299
You and Chartreuse hightail it
down to the Metals Research Wing...

07:45.466 --> 07:48.094
...of the Wayne Foundation,
pick up that precious metal.

07:48.260 --> 07:50.179
- Oh, and Emerald.
-Yes, poopsie?

07:50.346 --> 07:51.931
You go along as a decoy.

07:52.098 --> 07:53.891
Create a diversionary tactic...

07:54.058 --> 07:57.853
...just in case millionaire Bruce Wayne
or any member of his staff might be there.

07:59.230 --> 08:01.649
- Groovy...poopsie.
-Ha-ha-ha.

08:01.941 --> 08:03.109
I'll wait here.

08:03.275 --> 08:05.903
If anyone should recognize me
at the Wayne Foundation...

08:06.070 --> 08:08.906
...the Dynamic Demagogues might be--

08:11.409 --> 08:13.536
Where have you been, Verdigris?

08:13.703 --> 08:17.248
Just spreading little bits of panic
here and there, Joker.

08:17.540 --> 08:20.543
And I saw the Batmobile
parked in front of police headquarters...

08:20.710 --> 08:25.339
...so I planted a little green time bomb
under the dashboard, just like you told me to.

08:25.506 --> 08:27.550
And set it for midnight, I suppose?

08:27.717 --> 08:31.595
We Martians like to dispose
of our Earthly enemies at the Witching hour.

08:31.762 --> 08:34.432
Set for midnight on the nose, Joker.

08:37.351 --> 08:39.645
Mrs. Green.

08:39.812 --> 08:42.273
- Greenhorn.
-Greenhouse.

08:42.440 --> 08:45.860
- Green thumb. Little green men.
-From Mars.

08:46.027 --> 08:48.779
Of course, I remember now.

08:48.946 --> 08:52.283
Mrs. Green used to be the front woman
for that bunko artist...

08:52.450 --> 08:56.328
...who, at one time,
was blackmailing greengrocers.

08:56.495 --> 08:58.289
It's a small world, isn't it, sir?

08:58.456 --> 09:00.666
It's a small universe, Alfred.

09:00.833 --> 09:03.669
As I suspected, uh,
from the beginning, Robin...

09:03.836 --> 09:08.507
...this present Martian invasion is all a hoax.

09:08.674 --> 09:13.637
Including, somehow,
the little green intruder in the library.

09:13.804 --> 09:15.306
Now what, Batman?

09:15.473 --> 09:16.974
Well, let's see what this new...

09:17.141 --> 09:22.480
...Current Criminal Activity Bat-Disclosure Unit
has to disclose.

09:25.357 --> 09:28.903
"Joker at large.
Manufacturing a flying saucer."

09:29.070 --> 09:31.280
Gosh, Batman.
This machine's almost human.

09:31.447 --> 09:33.532
But not quite human enough, Robin.

09:33.699 --> 09:38.037
Just what would Joker be using
to make his flying saucer?

09:38.204 --> 09:39.830
Probably one of the lighter metals.

09:39.997 --> 09:43.501
- Titanium, beryllium--
-Titanium.

09:43.918 --> 09:45.878
Titanium.

09:46.045 --> 09:49.173
The supply of titanium
is very limited in this vicinity.

09:49.340 --> 09:52.176
But isn't there an abundant supply,
sir, of beryllium...

09:52.343 --> 09:54.845
...in the Metals Research Wing
of the Wayne Foundation?

09:55.012 --> 09:57.932
-Indeed there is.
-And Joker's just clever enough to know that.

09:58.099 --> 10:01.185
And may be planning
to appropriate it. Alfred.

10:01.352 --> 10:03.437
- Yes, sir?
-There's 15 minutes until midnight.

10:03.604 --> 10:06.023
- I know, sir.
-Pay a quick and casual call...

10:06.190 --> 10:08.692
...on the Wayne Foundation
and check on security there.

10:08.859 --> 10:11.070
Robin and I will follow.

10:11.237 --> 10:13.948
But I do not want our presence known...

10:14.115 --> 10:19.078
...until and if the Joker plays his hand.

10:19.245 --> 10:23.791
At once, sir. You know I find
such an assignment quite a challenge.

10:24.542 --> 10:27.336
I'll advise Commissioner Gordon.

10:28.003 --> 10:31.465
If our suspicions are right, old chum...

10:31.632 --> 10:36.720
...the Joker's terrorizing of Gotham City
will be stopped at once.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.724
Yes, Batman?

10:40.891 --> 10:42.518
The Joker?

10:42.685 --> 10:44.562
The Wayne Foundation?

10:44.728 --> 10:46.522
And you'll handle it yourself?

10:46.689 --> 10:49.024
Well, keep me informed, Batman.

10:49.191 --> 10:52.695
I'll send you any help you need. Right.

10:55.030 --> 10:57.825
What was that all about, commissioner?

10:57.992 --> 11:00.661
Well, Batman has reason to believe...

11:00.828 --> 11:05.416
...the Joker is behind
this so-called imminent Martian invasion.

11:05.583 --> 11:08.127
He also suspects
the next development will take place...

11:08.294 --> 11:11.088
...in the Metals Research Wing
of the Wayne Foundation.

11:14.925 --> 11:17.678
<i>NARRATOR". So on a night filled
with incredible happenings...</i>

11:17.845 --> 11:22.308
<i>...Barbara Gordon makes her own
incredible change into Batgirl...</i>

11:22.474 --> 11:24.852
...as <i>the Witching hour arrives
in the Batcave.</i>

11:25.436 --> 11:28.731
Alfred should be on his way by now.
To the Batmobile.

11:46.624 --> 11:50.794
What a coup. Ooh, what an incredible coup.

11:52.838 --> 11:58.010
Well, a mad scientist
to help us assemble my flying saucer.

11:58.177 --> 12:00.638
- If I may correct you, sir--
-You may not correct me.

12:00.804 --> 12:04.141
I know a mad scientist
when I see a mad scientist.

12:04.308 --> 12:05.768
- But I--
-Else why were you...

12:05.935 --> 12:08.562
...at the Metals Research Wing
of the Wayne Foundation...

12:08.729 --> 12:11.482
...when my men caught you?
Along with Batgirl.

12:11.649 --> 12:14.109
Caught coming in a window.

12:14.276 --> 12:16.111
Maybe we should find her a window...

12:16.278 --> 12:17.905
...in the sky.

12:18.072 --> 12:21.116
- You mean, put her in orbit, Joker?
-Exactly, Shamrock.

12:21.283 --> 12:23.702
Just as we're gonna put
my flying saucer in orbit.

12:23.869 --> 12:27.957
Yes, with the help of this huge supply
of beryllium you heisted. Ha-ha-ha!

12:28.123 --> 12:32.795
And all done with no sign
of Batman or Robin at all.

12:33.837 --> 12:37.466
Hee-hee. Of course, there's no sign
of Batman and Robin, Joker.

12:38.342 --> 12:40.344
Where have you been this time, Verdigris?

12:40.511 --> 12:42.846
Spreading more panic, Joker.

12:43.013 --> 12:44.848
Police headquarters is in turmoil.

12:45.015 --> 12:47.685
And the Batmobile is gone
from where it was last parked.

12:47.851 --> 12:50.688
And so are the Caped Cadavers.
Gone forever, Joker.

12:50.854 --> 12:52.731
Thanks to that green time bomb I planted.

12:52.898 --> 12:56.652
Oh, joy of joys. Ecstasy of ecstasies.

12:58.904 --> 13:01.407
Do you suppose
there's a working launching pad left...

13:01.573 --> 13:03.742
...in this abandoned launching pad factory?

13:03.909 --> 13:07.162
Yes, there's one in the launching pad
equipment locker. And some fuse.

13:07.329 --> 13:10.332
Oh, good.
While the countdown begins for Batgirl...

13:10.499 --> 13:14.044
...our mad captive scientist
will unpack the beryllium...

13:14.211 --> 13:16.880
...and then help me assemble
my flying saucer.

13:17.298 --> 13:21.093
<i>NARRATOR".
While back in the battered Batcave...</i>

13:23.971 --> 13:25.389
Batman.

13:25.556 --> 13:27.308
Batman.

13:28.726 --> 13:31.478
Batman, where are you?

13:31.645 --> 13:34.273
Batman? Where are you?

13:34.440 --> 13:36.567
Up here, old chum.

13:37.359 --> 13:41.030
Boy, I'd say we had ourselves a little blast.

13:41.196 --> 13:45.200
I'd say we had ourselves
one of Joker's lethal time bombs.

13:45.367 --> 13:48.662
No doubt planted
by one of his men from Mars.

13:53.083 --> 13:55.586
Holy rock garden.

13:58.797 --> 14:02.092
Look, the clock didn't break.
It's almost 8:30.

14:02.259 --> 14:07.097
- We've been out cold over eight hours.
-And apparently so has Alfred been out.

14:07.264 --> 14:08.932
At the Wayne Foundation.

14:09.099 --> 14:12.561
Where Joker and his little green menaces
were going to steal the beryllium.

14:12.728 --> 14:16.148
Do you suppose Alfred has tried
to get in contact with us?

14:16.315 --> 14:19.276
Every receiving device around here
has been broken.

14:19.443 --> 14:22.154
And by all rights, so should we have been.

14:22.321 --> 14:23.405
Sure, Batman.

14:23.572 --> 14:27.993
If it hadn't been for our Anti-Thermal
Bat T-shirts we've been wearing lately.

14:28.160 --> 14:31.830
- And look, the explosion even knocked--
-Knocked all the phones off the hooks.

14:31.997 --> 14:33.540
Yeah.

14:35.626 --> 14:37.252
Hello?

14:37.586 --> 14:40.672
Oh, there's no more current, Robin.

14:41.006 --> 14:46.261
Quickly, old chum. We must rig up
an Auxiliary Circuit Bat-regenerator.

14:47.096 --> 14:49.973
Who knows what's happened
to the outside world?

14:57.147 --> 15:00.818
Who knows what's happened
to the Caped Crusaders?

15:03.028 --> 15:06.323
I can't seem to locate them
anywhere, Mayor Lindseed.

15:06.490 --> 15:09.743
Do you expect me to report that
to Governor Stonefellow?

15:09.910 --> 15:13.163
To the president? Londinium?
To the United Nations?

15:13.330 --> 15:15.457
This is an emergency, commissioner.

15:15.624 --> 15:19.002
Flying saucers and men from Mars
don't invade our country every day.

15:19.169 --> 15:21.839
Well, at least they've stopped invading
for a minute.

15:22.005 --> 15:24.341
The sky is as clear as a die.

15:24.508 --> 15:28.470
Die? A very poor
choice of words, Chief O'Hara.

15:28.846 --> 15:32.516
That's what we may all be doing
if the Martians return. Dying.

15:32.683 --> 15:34.726
If we can't find Batman and Robin.

15:34.893 --> 15:36.520
Not to mention Batgirl.

15:38.355 --> 15:40.858
<i>NARRATOR".
But to mention Batgirl...</i>

15:44.111 --> 15:45.988
This is a unique experience.

15:46.155 --> 15:48.031
I've thrilled many a woman, Batgirl...

15:48.198 --> 15:51.869
...but I never sent one
completely in orbit before.

15:52.703 --> 15:57.708
You shall have company shortly, though,
now that my flying saucer is completed.

15:57.875 --> 16:00.544
Yes. We will take off immediately
after you do.

16:00.711 --> 16:04.673
And we'll wave to you occasionally
as we pass you circling the Earth.

16:06.049 --> 16:07.843
Of course, you will keep going forever...

16:08.010 --> 16:10.429
...while we will circle the Earth
a few more times...

16:10.596 --> 16:13.140
...to give everyone a good look
at my saucer...

16:13.307 --> 16:17.352
...as they await my ultimate ultimatum
in fear and trembling...

16:17.519 --> 16:20.230
...before I return ruler of the universe.

16:22.316 --> 16:24.276
This may be my last attempt
to reach you...

16:24.443 --> 16:26.904
...though I've been
trying desperately for hours.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.405
It works. It's Alfred.

16:28.572 --> 16:30.908
<i>ALFRED".
The Joker's about to put Batgirl into orbit...</i>

16:31.074 --> 16:34.953
...from the abandoned launching pad factory
on Flying Circus Hill.

16:36.121 --> 16:39.041
Are you talking to that handkerchief?

16:39.750 --> 16:42.920
No, just dabbing my eyes.

16:43.086 --> 16:46.840
Stronger men than I have wept
at moments like this.

16:49.259 --> 16:50.302
Aw.

16:52.596 --> 16:56.892
And then he's about to launch
his own flying saucer.

16:57.059 --> 17:00.854
- Holy known unknown flying objects.
-What?

17:01.021 --> 17:04.316
Holy known unknown flying objects.

17:04.483 --> 17:08.319
Robin, alert the Batcopter port
to ready the Batcopter.

17:08.487 --> 17:13.157
While I tell Commissioner Gordon
that communications have been reestablished.

17:13.325 --> 17:17.454
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five...

17:17.621 --> 17:20.415
...four, three, two, one.

17:20.582 --> 17:21.625
Blastoff.

17:30.092 --> 17:31.593
Ah! The fuse has gone out.

17:32.970 --> 17:35.305
That's right, Joker. It's out.

17:35.472 --> 17:39.268
The automatic fuse extinguisher
in my Batgirl utility belt...

17:39.434 --> 17:42.312
...will forever keep you
from putting me into orbit.

17:42.479 --> 17:45.691
Oh, untie her.
We'll take her with us in the flying saucer.

17:45.857 --> 17:48.318
And the mad scientist too.

17:48.485 --> 17:52.489
While I push the button that opens the roof
of this launching pad factory.

18:02.583 --> 18:05.043
I don't understand your language
too well, sir...

18:05.210 --> 18:09.840
...but I assume you're trying to tell me
the flying saucer is over Petronoviskoff.

18:10.924 --> 18:14.845
Oh. Oh, was over Petronoviskoff
three seconds ago.

18:15.512 --> 18:18.140
Well, thank you, sir, for calling.

18:19.558 --> 18:22.019
That was the first minister of the presidium.

18:22.853 --> 18:23.854
Barbara.

18:24.021 --> 18:25.147
- What?
-What?

18:25.314 --> 18:28.191
I said, Barbara. My daughter.

18:28.525 --> 18:32.571
I wonder what's happened to her
in all this excitement.

18:35.240 --> 18:38.201
<i>NARRATOR". And well might
Commissioner Gordon wonder...</i>

18:38.368 --> 18:39.911
<i>...what's happened to his daughter.</i>

18:41.622 --> 18:43.957
Oh. Look, right over there.

18:44.124 --> 18:46.877
Just a few billion miles. Saturn.

18:48.962 --> 18:51.715
How did you get mixed up
in a thing like this, Alfred?

18:51.882 --> 18:57.095
My job as millionaire Bruce Wayne's butler
sometimes calls for extracurricular duties.

18:57.262 --> 19:01.058
But, uh, this is going too far.

19:01.558 --> 19:05.103
Activate the Supersonic Decelerating
Contra-Rotating Turbines, Verdigris.

19:05.270 --> 19:08.899
We're getting a little too close to the sun.

19:09.858 --> 19:12.611
<i>NARRATOR".
While back on Earth...</i>

19:22.579 --> 19:25.374
Well, now we've seen New Auckland. Heh.

19:25.540 --> 19:27.417
Invert the compression radial ratio.

19:27.584 --> 19:32.381
Energize the tandem ailerons, Verdigris,
while I turn up this interplanetary Microphone.

19:33.757 --> 19:36.760
In 46 and three-eighth seconds,
we'll be over Gotham City...

19:36.927 --> 19:40.597
...where I will ultimate my ultimatum.

19:43.225 --> 19:44.267
<i>Mi, mi!</i>

19:45.936 --> 19:46.978
Yes. Ha, ha.

19:47.604 --> 19:50.315
Whoo! It sure beats walking.

19:50.482 --> 19:54.444
- Any sightings?
-None, but if Alfred's on that flying saucer...

19:54.611 --> 19:57.614
...maybe we can reach him
on our Intercosmic Two-Way Thermophone.

20:05.414 --> 20:07.332
I hear you, sir.

20:07.624 --> 20:09.626
Head straight for Flying Circus Hill.

20:10.168 --> 20:12.462
Flying Circus Hill?

20:12.629 --> 20:16.049
We're just entering the substratosphere
over Gotham City.

20:16.216 --> 20:21.346
I managed to put some homing beryl
into the beryllium this flying saucer is made of.

20:22.139 --> 20:26.309
- It should to head straight back--
-Are you talking to your handkerchief again?

20:26.476 --> 20:28.311
Hmm? Ah, heh.

20:28.603 --> 20:30.605
Just clearing my head.

20:30.772 --> 20:32.733
Altitude, you know.

20:33.984 --> 20:35.610
Oh. Heh.

20:36.069 --> 20:37.154
Good old Alfred.

20:37.320 --> 20:40.490
Yes, I'll head for Flying Circus Hill.
You alert Commissioner Gordon.

20:44.286 --> 20:48.457
Ha-ha-ha! It's time for my ultimate ultimatum.

20:49.207 --> 20:51.835
Hear this. Now hear this.

20:52.377 --> 20:56.882
All citizens of Gotham City and the world...

20:57.048 --> 21:00.177
<i>...this is the Joker speaking to you
from outer space.</i>

21:00.343 --> 21:02.179
<i>From inner outer space.</i>

21:04.181 --> 21:05.849
Yes, advising you to--

21:08.101 --> 21:11.521
What's the matter, Verdigris?
We've passed the city.

21:13.023 --> 21:15.192
We're headed right back
to Flying Circus Hill...

21:15.358 --> 21:18.403
...and the abandoned launching pad factory.

21:18.570 --> 21:21.031
Oh. Depress the Aerothermo Turret Resojets.

21:21.198 --> 21:25.202
Accelerate the
Isothermal Oxyacetylene Vaporometers.

21:25.368 --> 21:28.038
- Huh?
-Step on the gas!

21:28.538 --> 21:30.916
This, uh, thingamajig is stuck here.

21:31.082 --> 21:33.627
But we're headed right back
where we started.

21:37.714 --> 21:39.800
Ooh! Ooh!

21:52.229 --> 21:55.690
Well, at least it was a soft landing, poopsie.

21:55.857 --> 21:57.526
Yes, but on the wrong planet.

21:57.692 --> 22:01.404
I wanted to rule the world from Mars.
I liked the looks of that place.

22:01.571 --> 22:05.242
Yes, I think you'd be more comfortable there
at the moment, Joker.

23:06.469 --> 23:09.097
All right, boys, round them up.

23:16.897 --> 23:21.401
- It looks like you've flown your last saucer.
-But I came close, Batman. I came close.

23:21.568 --> 23:22.819
Close doesn't count.

23:22.986 --> 23:26.031
You'll come much closer
to washing tin saucers...

23:26.197 --> 23:28.825
...up at Warden Crichton's
cosmic calaboose, Joker. Let's go.

23:33.580 --> 23:36.166
Barbara, where have you been?

23:36.333 --> 23:38.084
Looking all over for you, Daddy.

23:38.251 --> 23:40.045
Bonnie said I might find you in here.

23:40.211 --> 23:44.716
I took an unexpected little trip,
and, uh, I didn't have time to let you know.

23:51.598 --> 23:56.811
Well, at least the Joker's
Martian invasion has been grounded.

23:56.978 --> 23:59.773
For five to 10 years, I would imagine.

24:03.568 --> 24:05.278
Yes, commissioner?

24:06.655 --> 24:09.866
Spiffany's Jewelry Store?

24:11.201 --> 24:13.703
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

24:13.870 --> 24:16.456
What do these window-shoppers look like?

24:17.540 --> 24:18.959
<i>NARRATOR".
What do they look like?</i>

24:20.085 --> 24:25.840
<i>Who could possibly describe
Dr. Cassandra and her husband Cabala...</i>

24:26.007 --> 24:30.679
<i>...eyeing the priceless
Mope Diamond hungrily...</i>

24:30.845 --> 24:32.180
<i>...and then disappearing?</i>

24:32.347 --> 24:34.891
<i>No wonder all of Gotham City is startled...</i>

24:35.058 --> 24:37.936
<i>...as you are bound to be
in our next episode.</i>
