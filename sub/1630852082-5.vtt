37:54.160 --> 37:55.920
<i>Mm.</i>

37:55.920 --> 37:58.720
<i>You've already given me a chunk
of that, Chief Superintendent,</i>

37:58.720 --> 38:01.480
<i>by having the grace
to use my proper name.</i>

38:02.880 --> 38:08.760
<i>I dislike the moniker

38:08.760 --> 38:11.200
<i>Please instruct them accordingly.</i>

38:19.440 --> 38:20.760
<i>Oh...</i>

38:22.000 --> 38:27.000
<i>The rest of 'em see investigation
as simple fact-gathering.</i>

38:28.200 --> 38:34.040
<i>But Lennox correctly sees these
as merely effects after the event.</i>

38:35.680 --> 38:39.360
<i>Therefore, he is not just a dustman,</i>

38:39.360 --> 38:43.760
<i>sweeping up the rubbish of society,
he's a true investigator.</i>

38:44.800 --> 38:50.280
<i>He looks into deeper illness,
not mere manifestations.</i>

38:50.280 --> 38:52.600
<i>And why should this concern you?</i>

38:52.600 --> 38:55.480
<i>I'm not being cheeky,
Chief Superintendent,</i>

38:55.480 --> 38:58.160
<i>but the very fact that you
have to ask me that question</i>

38:58.160 --> 39:02.480
<i>confirms to me that you're not
the man I'm looking for.</i>

39:08.960 --> 39:11.840
<i>Why? I don't know.</i>

39:13.280 --> 39:15.080
<i>But he sees me.</i>

39:16.160 --> 39:17.960

repay the frog favour now.</i>

40:20.760 --> 40:22.000
