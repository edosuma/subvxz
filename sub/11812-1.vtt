01:02.747 --> 01:06.789
It is high time that you get married, Alexandre.

01:06.872 --> 01:09.206
Soon, nobody wants him anymore.

01:09.289 --> 01:13.414
Look at your brother. He is married and has a child, soon maybe two.

01:13.497 --> 01:17.706
Someone must bring the Karrastopoulosätten on.

01:17.789 --> 01:23.165
But we'll never be a wedding picture where -just toilet paper!

01:23.248 --> 01:26.623
- All married I do feel bad. - That's life.

01:26.706 --> 01:31.915
You get married, you have children, you feel bad ... But you're married!

01:31.998 --> 01:34.832
- Otherwise aged man alone. - And die alone.

01:34.915 --> 01:42.124
You need a woman who cooks, cleans, cuts your toenails ...

01:43.791 --> 01:48.416
Come and get yourself a little muscle on my gym -

01:48.499 --> 01:50.666
- So you get lots of women since.

01:50.749 --> 01:58.458
I would take Stavroula. She has a good job and lots of money.

01:58.541 --> 02:02.458
- How much? - Two properties at Circular Quay.

02:02.541 --> 02:05.542

02:05.625 --> 02:09.125
- When I die, then? - Yes, if it comes to that.

02:09.208 --> 02:12.458
I may never get married!

02:49.627 --> 02:54.460
What a shame. Your little brother getting married before you.

02:54.544 --> 02:59.502
Your dad's so handsome, dressed up to the spirit in the bottle.

03:01.461 --> 03:05.503
- Are you a part of this marriage of free will? - Yes.

03:05.586 --> 03:11.253
- Are you a part of this marriage of free will? - Yes.

03:56.797 --> 04:01.088
Get out, all men. It is time for the women's party.

04:45.840 --> 04:51.341
Pythagoras, Greek course, showed that C² = a² + b².

04:51.424 --> 04:54.716
When will we get use to it?

04:54.799 --> 05:00.674
- You play football, huh? If you lift weights? - Yes, to gain muscle.

05:01.883 --> 05:05.633
Mathematics trains the muscles up here -

05:05.716 --> 05:08.466
- So you get better at football.

05:13.342 --> 05:17.217
No cell phones in class, the tutor!

05:17.300 --> 05:19.967
- I will not. - We always go out on Fridays!

05:20.050 --> 05:24.592
- Claire will bring a colleague. - I do not like to be paired.

05:24.676 --> 05:28.676
- Is he talking with his girlfriend? - He's gay.

05:28.759 --> 05:32.718
- Your students say you're gay. - They always do.

05:32.801 --> 05:36.426
Now you can prove otherwise.

05:36.509 --> 05:40.551
No, I never set my foot in a bar again.

05:42.218 --> 05:48.010
Talk to her. She is Greek, it will appear on the mustache.

06:04.094 --> 06:08.469
- Sorry! - Will not you help me up?

06:08.553 --> 06:10.636
Well, of course.

06:21.928 --> 06:24.428
Sorry.

06:25.928 --> 06:27.470
How did it go?

06:27.553 --> 06:31.054
Apart from the fracture and should dress ...

06:31.137 --> 06:35.345
- Take the barstool, you. - No, I do not want it.

06:35.429 --> 06:39.262
- Well, take it. - I'll take it.

06:49.846 --> 06:53.180
- It was Greek. - I'm not greek.

06:53.263 --> 06:57.055
- What the hell am I doing ...? - What did you say?

06:57.138 --> 06:59.346
I was hittvingad.

06:59.430 --> 07:05.097
I also! I have worked in court all day and a colleague took me here.

07:05.180 --> 07:09.305
- So you're a lawyer? - Greedy and uncaring ... I know.

07:09.389 --> 07:14.681
- No, I thought extol the legal profession. - So you're a lawyer?

07:14.764 --> 07:18.181
No, I'm a math teacher.

07:19.931 --> 07:23.223
Should not you be at home and solve equations?

07:23.306 --> 07:26.973
I calculated the probability of meeting someone nice here.

07:27.056 --> 07:32.515
- How big was it? - I have not finished counting yet.

07:38.182 --> 07:41.765
- My name is Eve. - Alex.

07:41.848 --> 07:44.849
So you've found each other.

07:55.557 --> 07:57.974
What a beautiful view.

07:59.683 --> 08:04.683
Yes, I see it from work every day, but have never climbed.

08:04.766 --> 08:07.850
- What oaustraliskt of you! - Have you done it?

08:07.933 --> 08:10.683
No, I'm afraid of heights.

08:12.100 --> 08:18.600
Dad went over that bridge 40 years ago, with $ 20 in his pocket.

08:18.683 --> 08:22.850
He jumped on a boat and said, "Take me to the Harbour Bridge!"

08:22.934 --> 08:27.017
Two days later, he met a grumpy old Greek.

08:27.100 --> 08:29.226
"Are you Greek? This is my daughter."

08:29.309 --> 08:34.226
When they reached the bridge was mom and dad promised.

08:34.308 --> 08:38.308
Four houses and a souvlakibar later, here I am.

08:38.393 --> 08:40.601
My parents have only one house.

08:40.683 --> 08:45.351
They use the notes as insulation, as all Arabs.

08:49.351 --> 08:53.352
- You will probably not sleep much last night. - I do not live with Paul.

08:53.435 --> 08:55.977
- Do you live alone? - No.

08:56.060 --> 09:00.894
- At the parents? - It's a little hard to explain ...

09:00.977 --> 09:05.811
I live with my. The real estate market is difficult and the rent is just ...

09:05.894 --> 09:13.478
- ... Dead money. My father's words. - It's Mom's standard phrase.

09:13.561 --> 09:19.311
- See you. - Do not do anything I would not do.

09:21.770 --> 09:24.853
What do we do now?

09:26.270 --> 09:29.687
- What is everyone doing at this time. - What is it?

10:05.105 --> 10:10.272
- I'm a bit of a speed demon. - You do not say...

10:10.355 --> 10:13.147
- What have you been drinking? - No, it is against my religion.

10:13.230 --> 10:17.647
But above all, let me be for the sake of calories.

10:32.523 --> 10:38.315
Hello there! So there you must not do.

10:38.398 --> 10:41.523
Shut up! Mind your own business!

10:41.607 --> 10:47.107
- Incredible! - Yes, what is it with people ...?

10:47.190 --> 10:50.482
- Alexandre? Is it you? - Yes, Daddy.

10:58.316 --> 11:01.232
Thanks for the ride.

11:04.358 --> 11:10.816
I usually let my students meet with professionals of foreign origin ...

11:10.900 --> 11:15.941
- It's probably not a good idea. - Why not?

11:16.025 --> 11:18.983
I take 480 per hour.

11:21.983 --> 11:24.525
I'm just kidding.

11:58.068 --> 12:04.777
How you going to get married when you're doing that?

12:04.860 --> 12:08.986
Pinched you see her ass? Come, I will show.

12:40.529 --> 12:42.362
Hello, girls.

12:42.445 --> 12:45.321
A crappy, crappy two, three shit ...

12:57.321 --> 12:59.446
I apologize.

13:04.071 --> 13:09.947
It's time for something fun, exciting and stimulating: Algebra!

13:10.030 --> 13:14.989
- The Arabs invented algebra. - The Greeks invented everything, Rima!

13:15.072 --> 13:19.614
Rima's right. The Arabs invented it, but the Greeks made it sexy.

13:19.697 --> 13:23.406
- Alpha, Beta ... - ... gamma neck.

13:32.239 --> 13:34.406
Hi.

13:35.656 --> 13:39.990
- Can I come in? - Sure, come on in.

14:06.366 --> 14:11.574

14:11.658 --> 14:16.783
- Give the iron, the schoolmaster. - Talk about personal chemistry.

14:16.866 --> 14:20.741
You have to think about chemistry in the next lesson.

14:20.825 --> 14:25.033
When I was your age were also losers to school.

14:25.117 --> 14:29.325
"I was an immigrant kid who no one believed" -

14:29.409 --> 14:33.867
- "But I struggled and succeeded." Recognize this?

14:33.950 --> 14:38.242
How many of you want to contribute to society?

14:38.951 --> 14:44.076
Giving voice to those who do not have their own voice.

14:47.534 --> 14:50.785
Defending human rights?

14:51.868 --> 14:55.160
How many of you want to get rich?

14:56.951 --> 15:01.243
If he asks, do you go out with him?

15:02.452 --> 15:07.160

15:13.702 --> 15:20.994

Okay bye.

15:42.662 --> 15:48.495

15:48.579 --> 15:51.121
Why did you do it?

15:51.204 --> 15:56.579
I thought about it, but saw before me that our parents met.

15:56.663 --> 16:02.746
When should you stop adapt to your parents? Call her!

16:05.121 --> 16:10.163
Mr. Karrastopoulos! Here comes the unwanted son.

16:18.038 --> 16:23.247
Hey, it's Eve. Leave a message.

16:23.330 --> 16:26.581

16:32.414 --> 16:36.581
- And thank you for coming today.

16:38.039 --> 16:40.123

You have Burns to Crown tomorrow morning, Claire.

16:49.623 --> 16:52.207
Tack.

16:59.665 --> 17:03.957
The food is delicious, Mrs. Karrastopoulos.

17:04.040 --> 17:06.790
It does not fit, you can cook your own food.

17:06.874 --> 17:10.165
Send the bread. Wake!

17:10.249 --> 17:13.583
- Behave yourself, Stav. - He's gone.

17:13.665 --> 17:15.749
Sorry.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.750
- Hello? - If I call inappropriate?

17:23.833 --> 17:28.458
- No not at all! - I was going to ask if you want ...

17:28.541 --> 17:33.792
- Why do you have a Muslim books? - A moment.

17:33.875 --> 17:40.417
They are Paul. He is dating a Muslim. But I advise him.

17:40.501 --> 17:44.292
- Why do you do it? - Because she's a Muslim!

17:44.376 --> 17:48.834
- Are you happy, Paul? - I love her.

17:48.918 --> 17:54.918
Do not listen to this idiot. So what if she is Muslim?

17:55.001 --> 17:59.793
- Just our boys are happy. - Amen!

17:59.876 --> 18:02.960
Thousands of women, and you choose a Muslim?

18:03.043 --> 18:05.960
- How do you stand out? - Alcohol in quantities.

18:06.043 --> 18:11.919
Sorry about that. Want to go for a drink sometime?

18:14.002 --> 18:19.294
- It's probably not a good idea. - Personal chemistry, then? Students saw it.

18:19.377 --> 18:24.211
- It is not. - So you agree? Just a drink!

18:24.294 --> 18:28.669
No, you do not drink. No ... pork steak? Vegetarian?

18:28.753 --> 18:33.878
I'm sorry, Alex. It was nice meeting you.

19:18.838 --> 19:21.380
She's checking you out.

19:21.463 --> 19:24.839
The church is the perfect pickup instead.

19:24.922 --> 19:28.464
I'm just trying to help.

19:36.256 --> 19:40.048
Picks up on my wife in the church?

19:43.006 --> 19:45.923
Incompetent.

19:53.548 --> 19:57.757
I got engaged on Saturday, with my cousin Abdul.

19:57.840 --> 20:01.424
- Cousin? - It's okay in our religion.

20:01.507 --> 20:05.257
Every Lebanese is married to his cousin.

20:05.340 --> 20:09.132
Do not look so shocked, it was allowed in England too.

20:09.216 --> 20:11.924
Yes, but it's not 1500 anymore earnings ratio.

20:12.007 --> 20:16.091
- When are you getting married? - Next year. If you know you know it.

20:16.174 --> 20:21.383
A friend of mine recently met a Muslim woman, and said the same thing.

20:21.466 --> 20:24.050
- Where they met? - At a bar.

20:24.133 --> 20:26.216
- She drank alcohol? - No water.

20:26.300 --> 20:29.175
- Dating you a Muslim? - No, a friend.

20:29.258 --> 20:32.717
Be careful you do not get a rod of her brothers.

20:32.800 --> 20:38.009
- What do you see in him, Sara? - His cock is as great as his ego.

20:38.092 --> 20:43.509
If she is a believer bet she did not wholeheartedly until she marries.

20:43.592 --> 20:48.842
A wise Muslim does not choose a non - Muslim. The parents are insane!

20:48.926 --> 20:54.926
- He has good job, good family ... - Our values ​​differ.

20:55.009 --> 20:58.176
- You're damn smoked. - Chris ...

20:58.260 --> 20:59.968
You're damn smoked.

21:00.051 --> 21:04.218
- You must work on your love life. - Yes, you need a girlfriend.

21:04.301 --> 21:08.552
- Why do I need it? - You see empty out.

21:08.635 --> 21:10.802
Yes, it radiates not about you.

21:10.885 --> 21:16.052
It fixes most of the brothel for $ 180.

21:26.844 --> 21:28.886
- Hello. - Stalking is a crime.

21:28.969 --> 21:34.303
It's not stalking if you only do it once. I hope...

21:34.386 --> 21:39.636
How can you be sure that you do not say to yourself in 30 years:

21:39.720 --> 21:45.178
"Alex should have had a chance. He was lactose intolerant, but okay."

21:45.262 --> 21:48.053
- She gives you a chance. - Really?

21:48.137 --> 21:51.554
Paja not a cliché biodejt only.

21:51.637 --> 21:55.095
I had imagined this.

21:55.179 --> 21:57.221
GIFT VOUCHER

22:07.138 --> 22:11.013
- Yeah, do you have any brothers? - Five pieces.

22:11.096 --> 22:13.971
But do not worry, they sit inside.

22:53.098 --> 22:54.848
What are you doing?

23:26.141 --> 23:30.891
- Is she Greek? - No, but she would like.

23:30.975 --> 23:34.683
- I like her already. - You will love her.

23:34.767 --> 23:38.017
She talks about her problems, you should not try to solve them.

23:38.100 --> 23:41.892
I have been a real casanova.

23:41.975 --> 23:47.392
Go to a fancy place, was not stingy. Here you get.

23:49.059 --> 23:52.934
- Have fun now. - Thanks.

23:56.893 --> 23:59.684
He is matchless.

23:59.768 --> 24:05.018
- How is the weather in Beirut? - Do not yell, they can hear you.

24:05.101 --> 24:07.518
Show us the husband.

24:09.977 --> 24:15.560
Come and visit now.

24:15.643 --> 24:19.560
- How's it going? - Eve! Eve!

24:19.644 --> 24:22.602
We skypar! Where are you?

24:22.685 --> 24:26.144
I have to hurry out.

24:26.227 --> 24:31.978
Muhammad, your fiance, he skypar from Lebanon!

24:34.144 --> 24:38.436
- He is not my fiance. - Soon!

24:38.519 --> 24:42.561
- I'm not interested! - You had so much fun together.

24:42.645 --> 24:46.270
It was a year ago. Forget it.

24:46.353 --> 24:50.978
- It is a good Muslim family. - Stop! We're just friends.

24:51.062 --> 24:55.854
- Talk to him. - I can not, Mom.

24:55.937 --> 24:59.645
Please, Mom, you can not.

24:59.729 --> 25:03.937
Talk a little short for my sake.

25:09.396 --> 25:12.229
Sorry, Dad.

25:14.229 --> 25:19.646
- Hey, Eve! - Hello. How are you?

25:19.730 --> 25:25.105
- Good. How is it at work? - Good. Much to do.

25:25.188 --> 25:30.689
I was going to come and visit.

25:30.772 --> 25:35.814
There ... I have ... It would be nice.

25:35.897 --> 25:38.939
- Then we can hang out. - Yes.

25:39.022 --> 25:46.189
It goes up the stairs to bågvalvets highest point -1332 steps.

25:46.273 --> 25:50.148
Arch rises to 134 meters above sea level.

25:50.231 --> 25:54.606
The roadway is so high that cruise ships can pass underneath.

25:54.690 --> 25:59.356
With six million bolts and 52,000 tons of steel ...

25:59.440 --> 26:02.815
Excuse. Did you come here by boat under the bridge?

26:02.898 --> 26:06.982
I came with jumbo jet, your whippersnapper.

26:15.149 --> 26:20.566
- How is the weather in Beirut? - Warm. It's summer.

26:20.649 --> 26:24.358
- How is it with you? - Cold.

26:26.941 --> 26:33.066
I must go now, I'm late. It was nice to talk.

26:33.150 --> 26:36.650
See you soon. Bye.

26:39.650 --> 26:41.817
Where are you going?

26:50.692 --> 26:57.234
I knew you would come. This is yours.

27:10.943 --> 27:15.277
- Thanks. - How does it feel?

27:17.652 --> 27:21.319
Do not worry, this will be fun.

27:43.111 --> 27:45.903
No...

27:46.861 --> 27:49.361
If you want to stay?

27:51.028 --> 27:54.737
No ... I want to end up.

28:53.948 --> 28:56.656
You did it!

28:57.740 --> 29:01.198
- Look at the view! - No.

30:52.453 --> 30:55.078
Mother!

30:55.162 --> 31:00.453
- Come home for dinner. - Yes good Bye.

31:00.537 --> 31:05.495
When will you get married? We can find a nice Muslim at you in Lebanon.

31:05.579 --> 31:10.454
- Maybe I will find someone before then. - You do not like the Muslims here.

31:10.537 --> 31:15.162
- He may not be a Muslim. - An Australian, full days on end?

31:15.246 --> 31:20.704
"G'day, mate! Ro hit beer and meat pie!"

31:20.788 --> 31:25.913
- What is their culture? - Greek culture, then?

31:25.996 --> 31:31.622
Greeks are talking only about the antiquity! They think they have invented everything.

31:31.705 --> 31:36.913
- Do not they? - No, Sanskrit came from us.

31:36.997 --> 31:41.080
- Oil and algebra. - We give to charity.

31:41.164 --> 31:46.414
Greeks are greedy. They have to pay to pray!

31:49.247 --> 31:54.206
I knew Greg.

31:54.289 --> 31:57.123
I had a mind to kill you.

31:57.206 --> 32:00.998
If your father found out, he had done it.

32:01.081 --> 32:07.415
But I know you will not pull dishonor upon us again.

32:19.874 --> 32:26.041
Good morning. My name is Bassam and I'll talk to you today.

32:26.124 --> 32:30.333
- Why do we have headscarves? - I told you.

32:30.416 --> 32:36.249
Islam is all about family. Islam is against everything that divides the family.

32:36.333 --> 32:42.750
We Greeks also wants the family. Maybe too much sometimes.

32:42.833 --> 32:46.250
Tomer is in love with a Muslim.

32:46.333 --> 32:51.834
- Yes, he wants to learn about Islam. - What is a mosque with his owner to do?

32:51.917 --> 32:57.459
- Will you marry non -muslimer? - Only men can do it.

32:57.542 --> 32:59.251
- Damn smoked. - Chris!

32:59.334 --> 33:02.667
I said "damn", not "damn".

33:02.751 --> 33:09.584
Young law sometimes. I do too.

33:09.668 --> 33:15.751
- If you need to convert? - We believe that everyone is born as Muslims.

33:15.835 --> 33:21.168
So if you live as a Muslim, you may marry her.

33:21.252 --> 33:27.127
- He must be a Muslim. - Now you get rod of the Greeks instead.

33:27.210 --> 33:30.919
Okay, follow me.

34:16.004 --> 34:21.838
- Here comes the bad influence! - Allahu Akbar ...

34:27.755 --> 34:33.880
A sort of Lebanese trousseau. Mom has collected since before I was born.

34:33.963 --> 34:39.047
- But she never married, like you. - Paul friar never.

34:39.130 --> 34:42.172
- We must change. - Where are you going?

34:42.255 --> 34:44.839
One thing about the job.

34:44.922 --> 34:49.672
Muhammad is supposed Skype! What should I say?

34:49.755 --> 34:53.172
Tell her she has met another.

34:58.673 --> 35:03.256
She broke up because I was not married material.

35:03.339 --> 35:09.881
I asked what it is, and she said, "over half a million after tax".

35:09.965 --> 35:15.382
I took it pretty well, and pursued her only half a year.

35:15.465 --> 35:19.799
When it ended with Greg, I left the country in a year.

35:19.882 --> 35:25.841
He could not handle my religion. It would be easier to be a Christian.

35:25.924 --> 35:30.049
- You have not hijab. - Then take the people for a bomber.

35:30.132 --> 35:33.841
My parents are active believers, but not me. Are you religious?

35:33.924 --> 35:40.550
Hell no, thank God ... They accept it, only I marry a Greek.

35:40.633 --> 35:47.091
- Then this is doomed to failure. - Would little religion hinder us?

35:48.467 --> 35:54.425
This is where we are. You will feel comfortable, it is traditional Greek.

35:54.508 --> 35:57.675
Stuff I grew up with.

36:04.592 --> 36:09.217
You've probably never been to a Greek feast before.

36:13.634 --> 36:16.718
Can I join in?

36:16.801 --> 36:20.343
- No ... - Come on, Eve!

36:20.426 --> 36:25.468
- I do not know how to do it. - Left, right, left, right ...

36:25.552 --> 36:28.760
And back. Are you in?

36:48.261 --> 36:50.803
Alex!

38:01.889 --> 38:04.431
He is full.

38:15.973 --> 38:18.765
- Where have you been? - On a job ...

38:18.848 --> 38:24.265
You meet a non -muslim. Do not lie to me!

38:24.349 --> 38:28.682
- How did you find out? - Never mind! Have you...?

38:28.765 --> 38:32.266
- Mamma!
- Har ni haft s -e -x?

38:32.349 --> 38:37.016
- It's none of your doing! - This is your fault!

38:37.099 --> 38:41.099
- My fault? - You are not strict enough!

38:41.183 --> 38:45.475
Your 30 year-old daughter's -e -x with a non -muslim!

38:45.558 --> 38:48.850
Who put on my sister ?!

38:48.933 --> 38:55.475
- What are the other Lebanese say? - So what what they gossip about!

38:55.558 --> 38:58.767
- They will talk about us! - Salwa!

38:58.850 --> 39:03.892
Should you pull dishonor upon your family for a stand about half a year?

39:03.975 --> 39:06.767
Greg did after that!

39:06.851 --> 39:10.809
Do his parents about it? Do you think they accept you?

39:10.892 --> 39:13.809
Leave him!

39:46.977 --> 39:51.478
- Want to get drunk? - Half is for me.

39:54.144 --> 39:56.394
Really?

40:02.770 --> 40:06.270
- Yikes! - You get used to it.

40:08.812 --> 40:13.270
- Where is this going? - Which one?

40:13.354 --> 40:16.104
Our relationship.

40:18.312 --> 40:22.479
- Have you told your parents? - No.

40:25.896 --> 40:31.438
Alex ... It's probably best that we end this -

40:31.521 --> 40:35.230
- Before one of us gets hurt.

40:37.105 --> 40:39.355
Okay.

40:41.938 --> 40:44.605
- Come on. - Where?

40:44.688 --> 40:48.397
I'll introduce you to my parents.

40:48.480 --> 40:53.230
- If they are not mad then? - If they are not more than that, I'm satisfied.

40:53.314 --> 40:59.439
- I can not believe I'm doing this. - Do not think, we just do it.

41:04.564 --> 41:09.189
- We'll meet his parents. - Holy shit.

41:11.606 --> 41:16.440
They have been together for five minutes, and now she will meet Alex's parents?

41:16.523 --> 41:21.940
We have been together for five months. Why have not I been able to meet your?

41:22.023 --> 41:26.565
It presents not fuck buddies for their parents.

41:26.649 --> 41:29.774
So we're fuck buddies?

41:31.524 --> 41:32.690
Out!

41:37.982 --> 41:42.483
Mother? Dad? Is anybody home?

41:42.566 --> 41:47.316
It is cleaner than my parents. I thought that was impossible.

41:47.399 --> 41:51.900
Mommy's in love with detergent. No no...

41:54.816 --> 41:59.192
- Do you use my home as a brothel? - No! This is...

42:01.025 --> 42:05.484
This is Eve, my ... colleague.

42:05.567 --> 42:11.151
- Snack, you had sex on the couch. - Is that why there are plastic covers?

42:12.692 --> 42:15.192
- So good you have it. - Are you Greek?

42:15.276 --> 42:18.151
- No, I'm l ... - Lesbian?

42:18.234 --> 42:21.609
- No, I li ... - Lithuanian. She is from Lithuania.

42:21.693 --> 42:24.318
- Where is it? - South America.

42:24.401 --> 42:29.360
- Come on, Rod. - No, I want to know more about Lithuania.

42:29.443 --> 42:33.152
You may have a friend of my waster?

42:33.235 --> 42:37.193
- What kind are you looking for? - A woman with a pulse.

42:37.277 --> 42:41.819
- I have a friend named Su Lin ... - An Asian?

42:41.902 --> 42:46.735
- They're like cockroaches and any place! - Then I have an Australian.

42:46.819 --> 42:51.027
They are tattooed, super, smoke ...

42:51.111 --> 42:54.528
- They are light-footed. - But they like to ride.

42:54.611 --> 42:59.153
And they can not cook, but meat pie in the microwave.

42:59.236 --> 43:05.903
Do not worry about my husband. Only she is so kind, so we are satisfied.

43:05.986 --> 43:08.528
I'm just kidding.

43:08.611 --> 43:11.695
Lebanese Muslim, then?

43:11.778 --> 43:15.195
- Why not? - They are terrorists.

43:15.278 --> 43:18.862
- Suicide bombers. - Osama bin Laden.

43:18.945 --> 43:22.362
- Fidel Castro. - No, now I take offense!

43:22.445 --> 43:27.029
- Why? - Because I'm dating a Muslim!

43:27.112 --> 43:30.529
Eve is not Lithuanian, but Lebanese.

43:30.612 --> 43:33.696
And we should move in together!

43:42.530 --> 43:46.197
A Muslim ?! Out! Out!

43:57.405 --> 44:00.739
Are you happy now?

44:03.781 --> 44:07.447
- That went well. - Beyond expectation.

44:07.531 --> 44:10.114
- Really? - No.

44:10.198 --> 44:14.698
Are you going to move in together? It's what I call dedication.

44:14.781 --> 44:17.906
- What did the parents? - They had to call an ambulance.

44:17.990 --> 44:23.490
- There you see. - Want to see these again or not?

44:23.573 --> 44:26.365
This is Alex wrong.

44:26.448 --> 44:30.240
- It can not work. - It is certain.

44:30.324 --> 44:35.324
- Did you forget Greg? - Do not compare Alex with the pig.

44:35.407 --> 44:41.366
Mom might have been right. Muhammad is perhaps best for me.

44:41.449 --> 44:47.324
You're not interested, you said when you came home from Lebanon.

44:47.408 --> 44:54.866
Because I'm an idiot. Marriage is a contract for reproduction sake.

44:54.950 --> 45:02.617
Love is just a gimmick. All it gives us the anguish and heartache.

45:02.700 --> 45:05.450
You do not believe in that stuff myself.

45:05.533 --> 45:11.325
I can not imagine how my parents would react.

45:11.409 --> 45:14.326
There is only one way to find out.

45:33.326 --> 45:40.618
- Eve! Where have you been? - We have been beside ourselves with worry!

45:41.410 --> 45:45.077
Muhammad has skypat all evening. What should I say?

45:45.160 --> 45:49.077
Have you made out with your dirty Greeks?

45:49.952 --> 45:53.869
He wants me to move in with him.

46:06.995 --> 46:10.286
- It's not a good idea. - Feeling good mother?

46:10.370 --> 46:14.203
Yes, but Dad has not been so angry -

46:14.287 --> 46:19.037
- Since he forgot to submit lotto line, and he got four right.

46:19.120 --> 46:24.079
How the hell were you thinking when you took home a Muslim ?!

46:58.080 --> 47:00.580
Alex?

47:02.664 --> 47:07.247
Let be my sister, otherwise you take out life insurance.

47:18.664 --> 47:21.498
I thought you were in prison.

47:41.082 --> 47:43.666
Good morning, my son!

47:45.291 --> 47:48.582
Thanks! How are you, Mom?

47:48.666 --> 47:54.458
Yes, do not worry about me. It takes more than that to kill me.

48:06.042 --> 48:10.542
Is it true that your daughter should marry a non -muslim?

48:10.625 --> 48:15.917
- Who told you that? - I saw it on Youtube.

48:19.834 --> 48:23.001
Nonsense, they are just colleagues.

48:23.084 --> 48:28.168
I swear on my mother's grave that she will marry a Muslim.

48:28.251 --> 48:31.293
Hello, Mustafa and Ibrahim.

49:07.294 --> 49:10.545
Dad wants to talk to you.

49:14.711 --> 49:17.212
Now you are in trouble, Uncle Alex.

49:17.295 --> 49:21.712
Your Lebanese seem nice, but then you forget about the house.

49:21.795 --> 49:24.003
I do not want the house.

49:24.087 --> 49:28.962
You get a car, vacation in Greece, you just do not get married.

49:29.045 --> 49:32.921
- I do not want a car. - Then you're not my son!

49:33.004 --> 49:38.837
You're not even religious, dad. You think it's hypocrisy.

49:38.921 --> 49:45.088
- Quiet, the priest can hear. - You've said it yourself.

49:45.171 --> 49:50.713
- All just gossip in the church. - Other boys go anyway there.

49:50.796 --> 49:55.130
- They just go there to pick up. - If only you had done it!

49:55.213 --> 50:00.380
- Greece and Islam's enemies. - We live in Australia, Dad.

50:00.463 --> 50:04.255
So you want him to marry a Lebanese?

50:04.339 --> 50:10.797
Greece was occupied by the Muslims in 400 years. They slaughtered all Christian men.

50:10.881 --> 50:16.464
But we fought! If you marry you throw away 400 years of struggle -

50:16.548 --> 50:21.089
- For our religion, for our right to live ...

50:21.173 --> 50:25.256
She is nice, but this is more important than love.

50:25.340 --> 50:31.715
Finish, otherwise you lose your home, your family-all!

50:46.424 --> 50:51.632
I remember the first game I took you on. Look, how happy you were.

50:52.424 --> 50:55.883
Your mother was not as happy.

50:57.091 --> 51:01.258
Sit down, I want to talk to you.

51:09.967 --> 51:15.884
What should we do? Do you think you'll agree?

51:17.175 --> 51:20.592
Alex is not a Muslim.

51:20.675 --> 51:26.884
When we came here, we chose not to be like other Lebanese families.

51:26.967 --> 51:31.468
We have encouraged you to blend in, to mix s ...

51:31.551 --> 51:38.426
I thought that we were right, but now I do not anymore.

51:38.510 --> 51:44.885
If we had been more stringent maybe this had not happened.

51:44.968 --> 51:51.427
I'm sorry. It was not supposed to be like this.

51:54.635 --> 51:59.427
- I love him, Dad. - Love?

52:01.177 --> 52:06.386
- He is a very good person. - Good man?

52:07.928 --> 52:10.261
I love him.

52:19.678 --> 52:23.803
I want to meet Alex and his family.

52:27.178 --> 52:30.220
Invite them home to us.

52:30.304 --> 52:34.220
Bassam ... Have you gone mad?

52:35.345 --> 52:38.012
Not now, Salwa.

52:38.846 --> 52:43.596
- Eve seemed nice. - Everyone is nice at first.

52:43.679 --> 52:47.471
If Alex likes her, she must be good.

52:47.554 --> 52:53.680
What do you want me to do? Inviting Muslims on tabbouleh?

52:55.471 --> 52:58.180
Do you want to get married?

52:59.388 --> 53:04.972
- Do you want your son to become a Muslim? - She is a Muslim, he is orthodox.

53:05.055 --> 53:08.055
- It does not work that way. - Then we solve it.

53:08.139 --> 53:11.972
Do you want your grandchildren to become a Muslim?

53:12.055 --> 53:14.222
Not if it's a boy.

53:14.306 --> 53:17.639
They would circumcise his tiny penis!

53:20.056 --> 53:26.473
Alex will realize that the Orthodox and Muslims are like oil and water.

53:30.598 --> 53:34.807
Eve's parents have invited us home.

53:36.140 --> 53:39.807
I hate Bankstown. It is like Lebanon!

53:39.890 --> 53:42.140
No talking about Muslims, Dad.

53:42.224 --> 53:46.849
If they say something about the Greeks, they hear what we think of them!

53:46.932 --> 53:52.682
- Typically Greeks. Always running late. - Tell the mother not to offend them.

53:52.766 --> 53:57.266
If they're talking nonsense, I intend to tell it like it is.

54:03.099 --> 54:05.558
Wait!

54:05.641 --> 54:10.725
Many are shot here. We must be careful.

54:29.392 --> 54:32.309
Welcome, Mr. and Mrs. Karrastopoulos.

54:32.976 --> 54:36.184
- The shoes, Dad. - Are you stupid?

54:36.268 --> 54:40.893
- It does not, Alex. - Your feet stink.

54:44.726 --> 54:48.185
Luckily I am prepared.

54:49.310 --> 54:52.727
Mom, Dad ... This is Alex.

54:55.519 --> 55:00.602
This is my parents Salwa and Bassam El-Masri.

55:00.685 --> 55:02.686
Welcome.

55:02.769 --> 55:04.936
You can be yourself!

55:05.769 --> 55:12.436
- My wife has made Greek baklava. - It is certainly delicious.

55:12.519 --> 55:17.103
I have made Lebanese beklewa.

55:30.478 --> 55:34.354
- Would you like something to drink? - Yes, ouzo.

55:34.437 --> 55:37.937
There is no alcohol.

55:38.562 --> 55:40.604
What is this nonsense?

55:40.687 --> 55:43.271
Tea is good.

55:52.979 --> 55:56.855
- You have a very nice ... - How did you ...

56:03.480 --> 56:06.188
- Lebanese music? - Yes.

56:06.272 --> 56:10.355
- Do you hear the bouzouki? - It is similar to the Greek music.

56:10.439 --> 56:14.355
- We are more alike than you might think. - Nonsense.

56:18.606 --> 56:22.439
It went well for Greece Basketball EM.

56:22.522 --> 56:25.064
The Greek gods are on our side.

56:25.148 --> 56:29.106
Do not talk about your gods. Allah is one.

56:29.189 --> 56:35.148
Mr. Karrastopoulos will talk about Greek gods, if he wants it.

56:41.440 --> 56:44.232
What do you think about ...?

56:44.315 --> 56:48.940
- Giorgo! - It tastes like shit!

56:49.024 --> 56:52.190
Give me your baklava, please.

56:54.399 --> 56:58.649
I'll run up her baklava in his fat ass.

57:05.524 --> 57:08.691
What do you think about what has happened?

57:08.775 --> 57:15.150
You are nice, but I do not want to see my son with a Muslim.

57:15.233 --> 57:20.442
I do not want to see my daughter with a Greek who is pampered by her mother.

57:20.525 --> 57:24.317
- She's crazy! - No insults.

57:24.400 --> 57:27.775
Should we not ask Alex and Eve?

57:27.859 --> 57:30.901
- Where would you stay? - We can rent something.

57:30.984 --> 57:36.192
- Rent is just dead money. - Rent is just dead money.

57:39.401 --> 57:43.318
- When are you getting married? - And where?

57:43.401 --> 57:45.985
We have not talked about yet.

57:46.068 --> 57:50.860
- Eve may not marry in a church. - Alex may not marry in a mosque.

57:50.943 --> 57:55.277
Stupid Greek. You do not marry in mosques.

57:55.360 --> 57:58.152
- We may not get married. - Even worse!

57:58.235 --> 58:02.110
- Do you have children? - Maybe later.

58:02.194 --> 58:05.319
- What religion should they have? - Orthodox!

58:05.402 --> 58:09.444
I do not let my grandson drowned in boiling water.

58:09.527 --> 58:12.777
I do not let my grandchildren have ridiculous huckleberry!

58:12.861 --> 58:18.528
- You're stupid, Mr. Skatopolis! - Karrastopoulos!

58:18.611 --> 58:23.528
Have you not pli on your wife? You Lebanese places just to cause trouble!

58:23.611 --> 58:30.695
- You retire as a teenager! - You're ruining our country!

58:30.778 --> 58:36.987
Stop screaming! That's enough!

58:37.070 --> 58:43.070
- Hi. - Muhammad!

58:43.154 --> 58:45.487
You come at the right time.

58:45.571 --> 58:50.029
- Who are you? - Eve's fiancé.

58:52.363 --> 58:55.113
- Are you engaged? - No!

58:55.196 --> 59:01.446
- Yes! - Wonderful! - What did I say?

59:01.530 --> 59:06.863
This was nice. You have a nice home and a beautiful daughter.

59:06.947 --> 59:10.572
My congratulations!

59:10.655 --> 59:17.614
- Wait, Alex. - No, we'll miss the Greek X Factor.

59:17.697 --> 59:21.406
Nice to meet you, Mr. Skatopolis!

01:00:02.824 --> 01:00:07.033
- How are you darling? - Leave me alone.

01:00:07.658 --> 01:00:12.825
Trust me. It is best this way.

01:00:13.783 --> 01:00:21.075
I know it's hard now, but you will forget Alex.

01:00:21.158 --> 01:00:25.325
You will forget him.

01:00:33.784 --> 01:00:35.951
Okay.

01:00:55.410 --> 01:01:03.535
Do you hear! Take this to the car. Set it over there.

01:01:05.827 --> 01:01:12.827
It says it! Hurry up! Incompetent ...

01:01:13.994 --> 01:01:18.203
There you go. Slowly.

01:01:18.703 --> 01:01:22.578
Relax. Continue.

01:01:23.578 --> 01:01:27.661
- Hello. - Help...

01:01:34.578 --> 01:01:38.537
Alex ... Alex ...

01:01:41.079 --> 01:01:43.537
Hi.

01:01:44.495 --> 01:01:48.329
- Alex. - Good luck!

01:01:50.621 --> 01:01:53.121
Alex!

01:01:54.204 --> 01:01:59.996
Sorry for what happened. Sorry for everything.

01:02:08.663 --> 01:02:12.538
It does not matter. He seemed nice.

01:02:12.622 --> 01:02:17.622
He said the same thing about you. Perhaps it is you who should get married.

01:02:17.705 --> 01:02:21.455
It is not, he is a Muslim.

01:02:57.665 --> 01:03:01.582
You guys! Take in the hotel.

01:03:21.208 --> 01:03:25.125
- Ana bahebak. - What did you say?

01:03:25.208 --> 01:03:30.584
Nothing. I think I have the hand brake in the leg.

01:03:30.667 --> 01:03:34.250
Really sophisticated neck in a car ...

01:03:40.917 --> 01:03:44.667
- What len ​​you are! - Do you like it?

01:03:51.168 --> 01:03:54.335
- Did it go well? - Yes.

01:09:26.015 --> 01:09:30.100
Is there a problem in the gangster paradise, Sarah?

01:09:30.183 --> 01:09:38.142
His parents told him to dump its Australian sharamouda.

01:09:38.225 --> 01:09:41.559
- What does it mean? - Slut.

01:09:41.642 --> 01:09:46.850
- Is it true? - No, no one has control over me.

01:09:46.934 --> 01:09:52.517
- I have met two hot babes. - Tell the truth.

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:58.309
- Chris dumped her. - Chris! Why did not you come from?

01:09:58.393 --> 01:10:03.560
They promised me a car. A BMW.

01:10:03.643 --> 01:10:08.518
- So you let yourself be bribed. - You do not understand.

01:10:08.602 --> 01:10:14.769
You are such a coward. You should fight for me if you want me.

01:10:24.061 --> 01:10:28.394
- Can I come in? - I can not stand you, Rod.

01:10:28.477 --> 01:10:34.728
Wait. I came here to say I'm proud of you.

01:10:34.811 --> 01:10:40.186
I would never have dared. It takes courage to follow jihad.

01:10:43.811 --> 01:10:46.270
And.

01:10:48.812 --> 01:10:54.562
Dad was right. Relationships-religious disagree.

01:10:54.645 --> 01:11:00.479
- But for you everything goes smoothly. - Stella will leave me.

01:11:02.229 --> 01:11:09.896
It has gone on automatic long, since before Georgiaki born.

01:11:10.813 --> 01:11:15.646
Stella's had enough. She wants more.

01:11:15.730 --> 01:11:21.522
- Give her more, then. - I do not love her anymore.

01:11:21.605 --> 01:11:27.063
Honestly, I think I probably have never done it.

01:11:31.814 --> 01:11:38.564
- Why were you married, then? - I do not know. I had filled 30th

01:11:38.647 --> 01:11:43.939
She had a good job and was Greek. Our parents were overjoyed.

01:11:44.023 --> 01:11:49.481
They got along so well that they went on outings together.

01:11:50.481 --> 01:11:54.398
It felt like the right thing to do.

01:12:37.567 --> 01:12:40.858
Eve! Are you coming?

01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:54.859
- Nämen! It is just too expensive! - Tell everyone that I bought it.

01:12:54.942 --> 01:12:57.901
Do you really advertise it?

01:12:57.984 --> 01:13:02.734
It is becoming urgent, so go and switch on.

01:13:10.985 --> 01:13:17.693
- How did it go with Paul's parents? - No need to go to hospital.

01:13:20.777 --> 01:13:27.736
- You know that I mind? - You've been very clear.

01:13:27.819 --> 01:13:33.861
But I love you and you always have my support.

01:13:38.861 --> 01:13:46.028
Mr. Karrastopoulos've learned to listen to his heart.

01:13:46.111 --> 01:13:49.445
Like when we visited a mosque -

01:13:49.528 --> 01:13:53.820
- Because he wanted to know more about a bride he wanted to kn ...

01:13:53.903 --> 01:13:57.112
Thank you, Sarah.

01:13:57.195 --> 01:14:04.279
It is a great pleasure to announce the prize for greatest improvement.

01:14:04.362 --> 01:14:07.487
Welcome up, Chris!

01:14:44.656 --> 01:14:46.989
Ready, sis?

01:14:52.156 --> 01:14:55.240
How are you?

01:15:10.865 --> 01:15:16.199
- Where is the lawyer bride? - She had another for himself.

01:15:17.366 --> 01:15:20.324
You fit together.

01:15:22.907 --> 01:15:26.283
What does Ana bahebak, Rima?

01:15:27.699 --> 01:15:32.700
- I can not tell you. - Well, say it.

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:37.491
It means "I love you".

01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:44.992
I can not believe I just said "I love you" to the schoolmaster.

01:15:46.159 --> 01:15:53.701
- Go for it. - Yes do it. She loves you.

01:15:56.284 --> 01:16:00.076
Do it, schoolmaster.

01:16:02.701 --> 01:16:04.909
Put on her!

01:16:30.036 --> 01:16:33.619
Have you seen my sister? Do not lie to me!

01:16:33.702 --> 01:16:38.536
- You forgot the present! - Her brother! Call an ambulance!

01:16:38.619 --> 01:16:42.369
- I'm calling my cousins. - Shut up!

01:16:42.453 --> 01:16:47.703
- Let him be, he's a good teacher. - Fucking great!

01:16:47.786 --> 01:16:51.953
Do you love my sister? Swear!

01:16:56.453 --> 01:17:01.995
Tell that to her before she marries, then.

01:17:02.079 --> 01:17:05.662
If you hurt her, I'll kill you.

01:17:06.537 --> 01:17:09.496
Put on her!

01:17:09.579 --> 01:17:12.412
Hugging her, I mean.

01:17:43.831 --> 01:17:48.331
What's the hurry? I'm already late for the wedding.

01:18:02.290 --> 01:18:04.998
What is going on?

01:18:05.081 --> 01:18:09.290
Do you want me to be happy? Put yourselves in my car.

01:18:09.373 --> 01:18:13.124
- For the Muslims ?! - Would not you support me?

01:18:13.207 --> 01:18:17.374
- Was not it end? - Yes, but I love her!

01:18:17.457 --> 01:18:24.166
Hell, Dad! If you love me, you sit in the car!

01:18:24.249 --> 01:18:28.416
- Sit down! - I'm coming with. You also.

01:18:28.499 --> 01:18:32.958
How dare you put your pride in front of your son !?

01:18:33.041 --> 01:18:39.500
In 36 years, I cooked and washed your stinking underwear!

01:18:39.583 --> 01:18:42.500
I have not asked for anything!

01:18:42.583 --> 01:18:47.917
But now you, otherwise you will regret it!

01:18:49.458 --> 01:18:52.042
Stir in the pork!

01:19:03.792 --> 01:19:08.418
Damn it, come! We are going to hell all.

01:19:54.170 --> 01:20:00.670
- The Chinese destroy this country! - Recently it was the Arabs.

01:20:00.753 --> 01:20:05.629
The Chinese come here and live on benefits.

01:20:05.712 --> 01:20:09.587
- Go home to China! - Hey, George!

01:20:09.670 --> 01:20:13.046
- Where are you going? - To his Muslim!

01:20:13.129 --> 01:20:19.463
- It's like tzatziki and ... - Yes, but he refuses to listen!

01:20:43.964 --> 01:20:46.422
Stop yelling, he's running good.

01:20:46.505 --> 01:20:50.881
- Turn right! - No, go straight ahead!

01:20:53.214 --> 01:20:57.006
Will you provide for your wife?

01:20:58.173 --> 01:21:02.590
Will you take care of your husband?

01:21:03.715 --> 01:21:07.465
Will you take care of your home?

01:21:27.841 --> 01:21:32.758
Marriage requires respect, honesty and trust.

01:21:32.841 --> 01:21:37.341
Without these, the marriage can not survive.

01:21:37.424 --> 01:21:41.383
Included you this marriage of their own free will?

01:21:43.425 --> 01:21:46.508
- Yes. - Wait!

01:21:48.758 --> 01:21:52.592
- Sorry to interrupt. - What are you doing here?

01:21:52.675 --> 01:21:57.259
- I asked him to come. - Bring your son here!

01:21:57.342 --> 01:22:01.884
Then I take the baklava too. Baklava is Greek.

01:22:01.967 --> 01:22:07.509
Lebanese! You Greeks believe that everything is your inventions!

01:22:07.592 --> 01:22:12.134
- What is going on? - Calm down.

01:22:12.218 --> 01:22:15.051
I thought you were an honorable woman.

01:22:15.134 --> 01:22:21.301
I try to make you happy. Thank you by me to shame me?

01:22:21.385 --> 01:22:25.010
- Go away! - Let me speak.

01:22:25.093 --> 01:22:28.552
- Let him speak. - Let him speak!

01:22:29.218 --> 01:22:32.885
Thank you, Mr. El-Masri.

01:22:35.552 --> 01:22:39.844
A thousand times I thought of everything I want to say -

01:22:39.927 --> 01:22:45.428
- That we must let go of prejudices and appreciate each other ...

01:22:45.511 --> 01:22:52.303
But as simple as this: Eve, I bahebik you.

01:22:57.303 --> 01:23:00.178
Forget it, your waster!

01:23:21.846 --> 01:23:24.721
I can not, Alex.

01:24:01.473 --> 01:24:08.640
What did I say? The marries his kind, and we with ours.

01:24:08.723 --> 01:24:11.848
- You are wise, Mr. Skatopolis. - Karrastopoulos!

01:24:11.931 --> 01:24:15.765
Skatopolis, bottomless, the same thing!

01:24:20.807 --> 01:24:22.765
Come now.

01:24:22.849 --> 01:24:28.307
Included you this marriage of their own free will?

01:24:28.391 --> 01:24:30.766
And.

01:24:30.849 --> 01:24:34.099
Included you this marriage of their own free will?

01:24:34.182 --> 01:24:36.516
And.

01:24:38.266 --> 01:24:39.766
And.

01:24:39.849 --> 01:24:44.266
Included you this marriage of their own free will?

01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:58.725
- Sorry, Muhammad. - Alex!

01:25:00.975 --> 01:25:02.767
No...

01:25:05.684 --> 01:25:11.184
No! No! No, Eve!

01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:05.478
- S'Agapo Alex. - Ana bahabik, Eve.

01:26:07.145 --> 01:26:11.770
You need to work on your Arabic.

01:29:30.363 --> 01:29:33.904
