WEBVTT

00:48.006 --> 00:49.924
[Tory] In this White Rabbit Project...

00:50.008 --> 00:51.259
[Kari] Bonjour

00:53.261 --> 00:55.263
[Tory] we're putting hustlers
head to head...

00:56.556 --> 00:59.726
to find the most audacious
rip-offs in history.

01:00.226 --> 01:01.061
[laughs]

01:01.644 --> 01:04.105
Grant's trying to sell us
the car of the future.

01:04.189 --> 01:06.232
Most people have never
even heard of the Dale.

01:06.524 --> 01:10.236
[Tory] While Kari discovers how a gang
took Vegas for millions.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.030
It should not be possible.

01:12.322 --> 01:14.074
-[laughs]
-[Tory] I'm revealing the secrets...

01:14.866 --> 01:16.451
of the world's greediest gigolo.

01:17.285 --> 01:19.621
This kind of stuff doesn't
come naturally to me.

01:20.121 --> 01:23.041
Six contenders are tested
against our criteria,

01:23.291 --> 01:24.709
then scored and ranked

01:25.376 --> 01:27.629
to find the best scam of all time.

01:29.422 --> 01:33.927
So, scams... We're gonna rank these
based on how much they got away with,

01:34.010 --> 01:36.638
duration of the scam and originality.

01:36.721 --> 01:38.973
-I like a good story.
-[Grant] You don't wanna give points

01:39.057 --> 01:41.184
for doing the same thing over and over.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.980
[Tory]
My first scam contender is gonna rate high

01:46.064 --> 01:49.776
but to give it the best chance of success,
we need just the right atmosphere.

01:51.027 --> 01:52.028
-Hey.
-[laughs]

01:52.737 --> 01:56.324
All right, now, have you guys
ever heard of the Swiss Gigolo?

01:56.908 --> 01:59.202
No, but if you're buying, I'm listening.

01:59.285 --> 02:02.122
Well, there was a lot of sex,
a lot of lies

02:02.205 --> 02:03.456
and a whole lot of money.

02:03.540 --> 02:06.000
That sounds promising.
Go on, set the scene.

02:06.084 --> 02:09.045
Well, this guy decides
he doesn't wanna work anymore,

02:10.255 --> 02:11.798
so he turns con artist.

02:11.881 --> 02:13.007
-Nice shot.
-Yeah.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.140
[Tory] It starts around 2001.

02:20.890 --> 02:22.350
The guy's Swiss.

02:22.433 --> 02:25.353
And this is an investment banker
who's breaking bad.

02:25.770 --> 02:27.147
His target demographic:

02:27.730 --> 02:28.773
Older women.

02:30.775 --> 02:32.277
Now, this guy's no hunk.

02:34.070 --> 02:37.073
There's a reason
they called him the Swiss Gigolo.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.160
Here's how he operates:

02:45.123 --> 02:46.916
First, he wines and dines his mark.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.419
He romances them, you know, like:

02:50.003 --> 02:50.962
"Sixty-five?

02:52.130 --> 02:54.090
You don't look a day over 47."

02:54.173 --> 02:55.466
[giggles]

02:56.050 --> 02:59.220
He's telling them all kinds of stuff,
like "You look ravishing."

02:59.304 --> 03:00.597
[laughs]

03:01.181 --> 03:07.061
And, I don't know, "I wanna devour you,
not these... shrimps."

03:07.145 --> 03:08.313
So sweet.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.732
-Wait! Are you making this up?
-What?

03:10.815 --> 03:12.525
No. I mean I'm making up

03:12.609 --> 03:14.944
what he said.
I don't know. I wasn't there.

03:15.528 --> 03:16.696
-Can I finish?
-Go on.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.032
[Tory] He's sweet talking them,
stuff like:

03:19.115 --> 03:21.659
"The universe is four billion years old.

03:22.118 --> 03:23.912
You're just 75.

03:23.995 --> 03:25.330
[laughs]

03:25.413 --> 03:26.831
Would you like a straw?

03:28.041 --> 03:30.460
Here, let me cut that up for you."

03:32.295 --> 03:36.049
Like, he is literally showering them
with flowers and flattery.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.805
And before long, they're in love...

03:44.891 --> 03:46.059
and in his bed.

03:46.392 --> 03:48.311
So, he gives them this sob story

03:48.394 --> 03:51.731
about accidentally running over
a young girl in America.

03:52.273 --> 03:53.107
[gasps]

03:53.191 --> 03:58.613
Either he pays up millions of dollars
or faces... jail time.

03:59.322 --> 04:00.156
[gasps]

04:00.240 --> 04:03.868
In other versions, his victim
is the daughter of a Mafia big shot

04:03.952 --> 04:07.121
and without the money, he's... a dead man.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.040
[gasps, then sobs]

04:10.959 --> 04:12.460
So moved by his story,

04:12.543 --> 04:16.172
the women hand over piles
of money to save his butt.

04:17.799 --> 04:20.468
He goes, "I do love you."

04:21.219 --> 04:22.220
Oh.

04:22.595 --> 04:23.554
[Tory] Then vanishes.

04:24.555 --> 04:25.390
Darling...

04:26.975 --> 04:29.644
Oh, come back to bed.
Where have you gone?

04:31.145 --> 04:32.563
[woman] Darling...

04:33.898 --> 04:35.108
-Oh, thanks, dude.
-Yay.

04:35.733 --> 04:37.068
-Right on.
-Cheers.

04:37.652 --> 04:38.695
Cheers.

04:40.196 --> 04:42.240
And all these women fell for it?

04:42.532 --> 04:43.700
Except for one.

04:43.783 --> 04:46.869
An 83-year-old that he was dating
got suspicious

04:46.953 --> 04:49.998
and turned him in to the cops,
but then later dropped the charges.

04:50.081 --> 04:51.207
A year later she died.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.252
And one lady he was dating
was 50 years older than him.

04:54.335 --> 04:56.129
I guess older women need love, too.

04:56.629 --> 04:57.630
-Cheers.
-Apparently.

04:57.714 --> 04:59.090
-Cheers.
-[Kari and Grant laugh]

05:00.633 --> 05:01.634
[indistinct chatter]

05:01.718 --> 05:05.054
[Tory] By 2007,
he's ready to play in the big leagues.

05:06.848 --> 05:07.849
So, he targets...

05:08.516 --> 05:10.643
a well-known billionaire heiress,

05:11.394 --> 05:13.396
one of the richest hundred women on earth.

05:14.814 --> 05:15.898
Let's call her Holly.

05:18.359 --> 05:21.821
He slides up to her
and his opening line is:

05:22.655 --> 05:23.990
"My favorite book."

05:25.241 --> 05:28.911
Now, this girl's no slouch.
She knows when she's getting hit on,

05:28.995 --> 05:31.205
so she gives the guy the cold shoulder.

05:32.206 --> 05:35.251
But this scam artist
is ready for the long haul.

05:38.046 --> 05:40.173
Well, okay, not so long.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.718
I mean, at first Holly tries
to keep things in the shallow end.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.345
But this is the Swiss Gigolo,

05:46.929 --> 05:48.181
and pretty soon...

05:49.766 --> 05:50.767
she's in deep.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.187
And they're rocking the trailer.

05:54.270 --> 05:56.272
[both moaning]

06:02.737 --> 06:05.865
He gives her his usual routine
about the injured girl

06:05.948 --> 06:06.991
and the money he needs.

06:07.575 --> 06:09.368
And blah-blah-blah.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.037
Holly?

06:11.329 --> 06:13.414
She's been half expecting
something like this.

06:13.998 --> 06:15.124
She smells a scam.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.754
But he senses her suspicion,
so he changes things up

06:19.837 --> 06:21.589
and puts the blame on her.

06:23.341 --> 06:25.635
"You see things too materialistically.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.720
We are dealing with love.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.098
This is a matter of love."

06:33.017 --> 06:36.562
Dude, that sounds so creepy
coming out of your mouth.

06:36.646 --> 06:37.855
I don't talk like that.

06:37.939 --> 06:40.733
This kind of stuff
doesn't come naturally to me.

06:40.817 --> 06:41.943
Quit nursing your beer.

06:42.026 --> 06:44.112
Okay, okay, okay. So, what happens?

06:44.195 --> 06:45.530
Does she send him packing?

06:45.613 --> 06:48.533
Oh, no, no, no, no.
This guy's an experienced con man.

06:48.616 --> 06:50.326
He knows how to pick his targets.

06:50.409 --> 06:53.204
-I bet he gets the money.
-No way. She's rich,

06:53.287 --> 06:54.539
she's seen this before.

06:54.622 --> 06:56.040
I think she turns him in.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.041
You guys wanna bet?

06:57.792 --> 06:59.210
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Yeah.

06:59.460 --> 07:03.047
I say Andrew Jackson says
that she turns him in.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.215
Twenty bucks, I'm in.

07:04.757 --> 07:06.426
All right. Next time we see him,

07:06.509 --> 07:09.262
they're in the parking garage
of the gigolo's hotel.

07:09.345 --> 07:11.639
[Grant laughing]

07:15.309 --> 07:17.937
And as always,
Holly is driving a small car.

07:18.020 --> 07:21.065
She's a public figure,
doesn't like to flaunt the wealth.

07:21.315 --> 07:22.150
She's careful.

07:25.403 --> 07:26.779
But not careful enough.

07:29.699 --> 07:34.036
In the trunk there's 7 million euros.
That's $9 million.

07:35.246 --> 07:37.457
The Swiss Gigolo strikes again.

07:39.584 --> 07:41.878
No, why did she pay up?

07:41.961 --> 07:44.088
She eventually believed
in his bullshit story

07:44.172 --> 07:46.132
about the girl getting hit in America.

07:46.215 --> 07:47.925
She had a big heart and she paid him.

07:48.009 --> 07:50.136
Yes! I win. Pay up.

07:50.219 --> 07:52.263
God, that makes her so stupid.

07:52.346 --> 07:54.223
-Thank you.
-It's still your round.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.433
I'll be right back.

07:56.017 --> 07:56.893
Damn, that was fast.

07:56.976 --> 07:59.228
-I know, this bar's amazing.
-Where was I?

07:59.312 --> 08:01.606
Uh... So, $9 million.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.066
Probably more to come.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.360
What do you say, Byron?
Double or nothing?

08:06.736 --> 08:08.738
No way she's doing this twice.
You're on.

08:08.821 --> 08:11.240
Well, he figured
if he got nine million out of her,

08:11.324 --> 08:13.784
she probably has a lot more.
So, his whole goal,

08:13.868 --> 08:15.036
he's gonna get the rest.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.580
-And?
-She says no. Flat-out denies him.

08:18.164 --> 08:20.082
But then he drops a bombshell on her.

08:22.752 --> 08:25.713
He's secretly filmed
their sexual encounters.

08:31.385 --> 08:32.303
[gasps]

08:33.596 --> 08:36.849
"Pay up," he tells her,
or he's going to the press.

08:36.933 --> 08:40.228
The price? 49 million euros.

08:40.311 --> 08:42.104
That is $55 million.

08:43.439 --> 08:44.857
Holly's world collapses,

08:45.441 --> 08:46.943
right before her eyes.

08:47.777 --> 08:51.155
Give in and she's his prisoner for life.

08:54.742 --> 08:57.745
Call the cops and the tape goes public.

08:58.955 --> 09:00.623
Oh, my God. I hate men.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.625
-We are not blackmailers.
-[Grant] Right.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.252
That's where I draw the line.

09:04.335 --> 09:06.295
Whatever, what--? How'd it end?

09:07.088 --> 09:09.131
-She called the cops.
-I knew she'd turn him in.

09:09.215 --> 09:10.800
I knew she was turning him in.

09:10.883 --> 09:12.510
-I told you.
-Yup.

09:12.593 --> 09:15.137
And that is the Swiss Gigolo story.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.180
Go, Holly.

09:18.599 --> 09:19.475
[thud]

09:20.142 --> 09:20.977
Where'd Kari go?

09:21.060 --> 09:22.687
[Kari] It is so much fun down here.

09:23.771 --> 09:24.855
Check, please.

09:25.439 --> 09:27.483
-[laughs]
-So, that's what I call comedy gold.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.360
Oh, God, that's what you call that.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.989
Okay, I feel like the Swiss Gigolo
rates pretty high.

09:33.072 --> 09:37.577
He took ten million, that's one person
who came forward, the others didn't.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.996
And he operated for seven years.

09:40.079 --> 09:41.080
That's a long time.

09:41.163 --> 09:45.293
And the fact that he actually took money
from very smart women.

09:45.376 --> 09:50.798
As for originality, gigolo and blackmail,
they've been around for a long, long time.

09:50.881 --> 09:52.842
-You get low points there.
-Fine.

09:53.342 --> 09:54.927
Next, I wanna show you guys a story

09:55.011 --> 09:57.346
about a guy who says
he could make it rain.

10:05.646 --> 10:07.148
His name was Charles Hatfield.

10:08.482 --> 10:13.654
And in 1916, this scam artist was poised
for the greatest score of his career.

10:15.823 --> 10:16.907
The stakes were high.

10:17.908 --> 10:20.911
And the mark... was an entire city.

10:23.414 --> 10:24.957
After four years of drought,

10:25.041 --> 10:28.461
the city of San Diego, California,
was dry as a bone.

10:30.504 --> 10:32.048
And as incredible as it seems,

10:32.632 --> 10:36.761
the city council offered Hatfield $10,000
to make it rain.

10:39.722 --> 10:44.018
In today's money, that would be
almost a quarter of a million dollars.

10:44.894 --> 10:47.480
[thunder crashing]

10:47.813 --> 10:52.485
Before we find out if he succeeded
and claimed his reward, let's backtrack.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.446
As a young man,
Hatfield became obsessed

10:55.529 --> 10:58.157
with the so-called science
of pluviculture.

10:58.741 --> 11:02.370
Using a proprietary combination
of 23 chemicals

11:02.453 --> 11:06.499
poured into evaporative tanks
on top of 25-foot towers...

11:09.752 --> 11:13.923
he claimed he could tickle the clouds
and coax rain out of the sky.

11:14.632 --> 11:17.885
But he never told anyone
what chemicals he was using.

11:18.094 --> 11:20.262
Sound suspicious? I agree.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.849
Cloud seeding exists today.

11:23.933 --> 11:27.603
It involves aircraft introducing chemicals
into the atmosphere,

11:28.229 --> 11:32.441
causing clouds to form ice crystals
and eventually making it rain.

11:35.194 --> 11:38.197
But scientists can't agree
that it actually works.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.534
Yet back in the early 1900s,

11:41.617 --> 11:44.912
Hatfield convinced dozens
of communities he could do it

11:45.287 --> 11:47.498
using only ground-based towers.

11:49.041 --> 11:53.003
After supposedly bringing more than
7 inches of rain to Hemet, California...

11:53.587 --> 11:55.214
The Hemet News proclaimed:

11:55.798 --> 11:58.551
"Mr. Hatfield has had 15 contracts

11:58.634 --> 12:01.137
and he has not failed in one instance.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.431
His theory is proving beyond doubt

12:03.514 --> 12:05.391
that rain can be produced."

12:06.475 --> 12:09.311
True or not,
his propaganda was so good,

12:09.395 --> 12:14.150
he was hired by the city of San Diego
with a promise of $10,000

12:14.233 --> 12:17.403
if he could fill the Morena Reservoir
with rain.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.657
So, he got started mixing chemicals...

12:23.200 --> 12:25.077
setting up his towers...

12:28.914 --> 12:31.834
sending his rainmaking goodness
towards the sky.

12:34.211 --> 12:37.756
In a matter of days, the skies opened up.

12:38.257 --> 12:40.092
[thunder crashing]

12:40.968 --> 12:41.969
It was fantastic.

12:42.052 --> 12:44.138
His magic was working again.

12:44.638 --> 12:47.683
Soon the reservoir would be full,
and he'd be a rich man.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.145
There was just one problem.

12:52.521 --> 12:55.232
The rain didn't stop for over a month.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.570
[thunder rumbling]

13:07.369 --> 13:09.914
The dams broke and the city of San Diego

13:09.997 --> 13:13.334
suffered the most devastating flood
of the 20th century.

13:16.587 --> 13:18.130
Twenty people died.

13:18.589 --> 13:21.217
The damage was estimated
to be in the millions.

13:23.219 --> 13:27.097
The city of San Diego offered
to pay him the $10,000 reward,

13:27.181 --> 13:31.519
but only if he took responsibility
for the damage the flood caused.

13:32.061 --> 13:35.689
Knowing that would mean
he'd be paying out civil damages claims

13:35.773 --> 13:39.151
for the rest of his life,
Hatfield declined the fee.

13:40.319 --> 13:44.198
So, scam artist
or meteorological genius?

13:44.949 --> 13:48.452
My guess is that Hatfield's success
was mostly a combination

13:48.536 --> 13:49.912
of luck and clever timing.

13:50.788 --> 13:54.208
January and February
are the wettest months in San Diego.

13:54.708 --> 13:58.379
Guess when he put up his tower.
Right at the beginning of January.

13:59.838 --> 14:01.257
My money's on scam artist.

14:03.592 --> 14:07.179
Armed with nothing more
than basic knowledge of rainfall patterns

14:07.763 --> 14:08.931
and a bit of showmanship,

14:09.723 --> 14:13.018
Hatfield pulled the wool
over the eyes of a whole city.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.730
Hatfield never collected on this con,

14:16.814 --> 14:22.361
but over his rainmaking career,
he banked about $250,000 in today's money.

14:23.487 --> 14:28.450
All told, he operated for 25 years,
which should score well in criteria two.

14:29.034 --> 14:33.372
But I have to admit, he wasn't the first
to claim to be a rainmaker.

14:33.455 --> 14:35.541
So, not so high on originality.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.751
Okay, you can stop with the rain.

14:41.130 --> 14:43.215
[Kari] That's our second incredible scam.

14:43.299 --> 14:46.302
And there's some totally unbelievable ones
to come.

14:48.637 --> 14:51.140
Next I'm gonna take you
to a place with more grifters,

14:51.223 --> 14:53.851
charlatans, con artists and scammers
per square mile

14:53.934 --> 14:55.352
than anywhere on the planet:

14:55.936 --> 14:57.229
The Las Vegas Strip.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.279
Card counting. Dodgy dealers.

15:05.362 --> 15:06.530
Rigged roulette wheels.

15:06.614 --> 15:09.533
With 80 over years of surveilling
Vegas's gaming rooms,

15:10.117 --> 15:12.077
casino security
thought they'd seen it all.

15:12.161 --> 15:15.039
But one game in 2011 proved them wrong.

15:16.123 --> 15:17.791
Time: 10 p.m.

15:18.334 --> 15:21.670
Location:
One of Sin City's iconic casinos.

15:25.382 --> 15:26.383
Three men.

15:28.636 --> 15:29.762
One game of baccarat.

15:29.845 --> 15:31.472
Mind cutting the deck for us, sir?

15:32.389 --> 15:33.223
[Kari] As always,

15:33.307 --> 15:36.560
the dealer offers the red cutting card
to one of the players.

15:37.519 --> 15:39.855
Baccarat uses an eight-pack deck,

15:39.939 --> 15:42.107
a total of 416 cards.

15:42.691 --> 15:43.692
Place your bets.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.069
Based on pure chance

15:45.653 --> 15:48.155
and said to be virtually un-scammable.

15:49.990 --> 15:51.200
No more bets.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.619
At first, it's just a routine game

15:54.203 --> 15:55.996
with unremarkable bets being won...

15:57.081 --> 15:57.915
and lost.

15:58.540 --> 15:59.375
Then...

16:00.084 --> 16:00.918
Excuse me.

16:01.126 --> 16:03.462
One of the players leaves
to go to the bathroom.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.089
I'll be right back.

16:06.006 --> 16:06.966
Not unusual, either.

16:08.175 --> 16:09.677
Baccarat is a slow-moving game.

16:10.678 --> 16:11.971
The others keep playing...

16:12.513 --> 16:14.223
taking phone calls...

16:14.848 --> 16:16.100
listening to music.

16:18.477 --> 16:22.815
Still nothing strange,
until our man gets back from the bathroom.

16:23.023 --> 16:24.984
And then the whole game changes.

16:29.655 --> 16:32.116
Out of the blue,
player two makes a huge bet.

16:34.618 --> 16:35.953
The others follow his lead.

16:41.917 --> 16:44.670
-Bankers win.
-And they hit the jackpot.

16:47.715 --> 16:50.884
It's just the start
of an incredible winning streak...

16:53.846 --> 16:56.724
that soon catches the eye
of casino security.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.768
We have a situation at Table 1.

17:00.728 --> 17:04.273
A game of pure chance seems
to have become a sure bet.

17:05.733 --> 17:08.110
The casino knows it's being scammed...

17:08.193 --> 17:10.404
but it doesn't know how.

17:12.573 --> 17:15.826
Powerless to act,
security watch the trio cash their chips

17:16.493 --> 17:19.913
and stroll out $1 million richer.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.587
All right, so a baccarat hustle
is the scammer's equivalent

17:26.670 --> 17:30.007
to escaping from Alcatraz.
It should not be possible.

17:30.090 --> 17:33.052
Usually a casino con man's
gonna go for poker or blackjack

17:33.135 --> 17:36.805
because they're counting cards,
which is the classic casino scam.

17:36.889 --> 17:41.560
But in baccarat,
even if you could count 416 cards,

17:41.643 --> 17:44.563
you'd still have to know the exact order
they'd come out in.

17:44.646 --> 17:47.441
So, if they aren't counting cards,
what exactly is the scam?

17:47.524 --> 17:49.526
Let's rewind and check out
what's happening.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.030
So, three players...

17:53.822 --> 17:54.656
one dealer...

17:55.616 --> 17:57.451
eight decks, here we go.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.622
Mind cutting the deck for us, sir?

18:03.749 --> 18:06.752
Player one makes his cut.
Baccarat tradition.

18:06.835 --> 18:08.879
But also a weak link.

18:09.797 --> 18:13.383
Because now he knows the order
of every card in the deck.

18:14.009 --> 18:15.344
You're kidding me, right?

18:15.427 --> 18:16.261
Nope.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.347
Let's zoom in and check out how.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.060
Right there.

18:23.143 --> 18:26.188
Attached to his finger,
a tiny plastic spike,

18:26.980 --> 18:29.316
hidden from the dealer by the cut card.

18:32.611 --> 18:35.781
The spike rifles the deck,
revealing the value,

18:35.864 --> 18:38.408
suit and sequence of the entire pack.

18:40.828 --> 18:41.829
Thank you.

18:42.412 --> 18:45.374
But each card is only revealed for
like a fraction of a second,

18:45.457 --> 18:48.794
and how would he remember them all?
There's 416 cards in the deck.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.505
That's where his second trick
comes into play.

18:51.588 --> 18:53.298
It's hidden right up his sleeve.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.426
A tiny camera...

18:56.969 --> 18:58.220
quietly recording.

19:02.891 --> 19:04.935
Now, here comes the bathroom break.

19:05.602 --> 19:07.187
Excuse me. Be right back.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.275
But it's not nature calling.

19:12.359 --> 19:15.237
Inside a cubicle,
an accomplice with a laptop is waiting.

19:17.698 --> 19:19.491
Player one palms off the camera,

19:20.117 --> 19:21.660
then returns to the table.

19:24.454 --> 19:26.540
Meanwhile, back in the stall,

19:27.457 --> 19:31.003
the computer guy runs special software
that analyzes the footage...

19:32.004 --> 19:34.006
and turns it into a cheat sheet.

19:35.716 --> 19:38.260
Minutes later, player two gets a message.

19:40.262 --> 19:44.057
Now the whole deck is in the palm
of his hand.

19:46.101 --> 19:48.145
The game's changed from baccarat...

19:49.146 --> 19:50.272
to follow the leader.

19:52.774 --> 19:54.735
When you know
what card is coming up next,

19:56.320 --> 19:58.822
you just can't lose.

20:01.366 --> 20:02.910
We have a situation at Table 1.

20:02.993 --> 20:04.161
And security?

20:04.995 --> 20:06.163
They just can't win.

20:07.873 --> 20:10.709
What they don't know is
they've just been hustled

20:10.792 --> 20:12.461
by the so-called "Cutter Gang"

20:13.045 --> 20:15.964
who've been ripping off
Asian casinos for years.

20:19.009 --> 20:20.802
What they do is morally wrong...

20:22.804 --> 20:25.057
but they're also masters of their trade.

20:29.519 --> 20:30.896
This is such an elegant scam.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.941
They have 70 members in their gang.

20:34.024 --> 20:35.817
Wait a minute. Seventy guys?

20:35.901 --> 20:38.278
Yeah, they can substitute out
their core players.

20:38.362 --> 20:39.780
They're never identifiable.

20:39.863 --> 20:41.823
So, these guys are like cheating ninjas.

20:41.907 --> 20:42.824
[Kari] Right?

20:42.908 --> 20:44.534
How much money did they steal?

20:44.618 --> 20:47.913
We have no idea how much
they've actually gotten away with.

20:47.996 --> 20:51.166
It's been rumored that
there's been tens of millions of dollars,

20:51.250 --> 20:54.419
but you have to assume casinos
don't even know they've been hit.

20:54.503 --> 20:57.923
Conservatively,
I'm gonna give you the number 50 million.

20:58.006 --> 21:00.926
-Fifty million is a conservative number?
-Yeah.

21:01.009 --> 21:02.761
So, how long
have they been operating

21:02.844 --> 21:04.596
and have any of them been caught?

21:04.680 --> 21:08.267
Seven years ago,
we first started hearing about them.

21:08.850 --> 21:11.228
They're still out there.
They've never been caught.

21:11.728 --> 21:14.690
All right, what about originality?
How does this gang rate?

21:14.773 --> 21:17.192
I think they rate really high
for originality.

21:17.276 --> 21:21.738
When you think casino scam, you think
counting cards. You can't for baccarat.

21:21.822 --> 21:23.824
It's considered unbeatable.

21:23.907 --> 21:26.076
And finally, they never get greedy.

21:26.159 --> 21:28.996
They're smart.
They get out before the heat's on.

21:29.079 --> 21:30.622
These guys are impressive.

21:35.210 --> 21:37.129
[Tory] Next up, I'm backing a con man

21:37.212 --> 21:41.800
so successful, his name became
synonymous with the word "scam."

21:42.509 --> 21:46.722
In the 1920's, America seemed like a place
where anything was possible.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.017
Jazz joints were hopping,
Wall Street was booming.

21:50.100 --> 21:53.312
You could almost reach out
and touch the American dream.

21:54.688 --> 21:56.815
Millions of poor European immigrants

21:56.898 --> 21:59.026
were hoping the '20s
would roar for them, too.

21:59.693 --> 22:00.777
Many would get by.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.529
A few would get rich.

22:04.406 --> 22:08.243
But one Italian-born businessman
was getting so rich so fast

22:08.327 --> 22:13.040
that he would go down in history as one
of the greatest con artists of all time.

22:14.249 --> 22:15.834
[man 1] A few more flames here.

22:16.835 --> 22:18.003
[man 2] Marker.

22:19.421 --> 22:21.089
-[man 1] Roll cameras.
-[man 3] We're rolling.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.802
[Tory] In 1919 Boston,

22:25.886 --> 22:27.137
Carlo was broke.

22:27.929 --> 22:30.057
But he was handsome, charismatic...

22:32.309 --> 22:34.353
and, like, really handsome.

22:35.145 --> 22:36.271
[man 1] And action.

22:36.354 --> 22:39.941
Then he stumbled across the idea
that would make him famous.

22:40.108 --> 22:40.942
[ringing]

22:42.402 --> 22:43.612
Hey, ciao.

22:43.904 --> 22:47.282
[in Italian accent]
It's Mar-- No, Marco, no. It's Carlo.

22:47.949 --> 22:49.368
-[man 1] And cut.
-[man 2] Cutting.

22:50.786 --> 22:51.912
That guy cracks me up.

22:52.913 --> 22:53.997
[man 2] Take two.

22:54.081 --> 22:55.374
[man 1] Action.

22:55.457 --> 22:56.625
[bell rings]

22:58.043 --> 22:59.377
Hey, ciao.

22:59.461 --> 23:00.295
It's Carlo.

23:00.796 --> 23:03.965
Now, do I have a deal for you.
You're gonna love it.

23:04.341 --> 23:07.803
Carlo's big deal was based
on the resale of mail vouchers.

23:08.845 --> 23:09.679
Let me explain.

23:10.347 --> 23:15.685
Back in 1920, if you were in America
and were sending a letter to, say, Italy,

23:15.977 --> 23:17.979
you would include one of these.

23:18.063 --> 23:20.816
This was an international reply coupon.

23:20.899 --> 23:22.400
It was good for postage.

23:22.484 --> 23:24.277
You'd take this to the post office,

23:24.361 --> 23:25.904
exchange for a stamp,

23:25.987 --> 23:29.783
and they can mail the letter back
to you in the US.

23:30.450 --> 23:32.786
Now, Carlo realized quickly
that the coupons

23:32.869 --> 23:34.830
not only could be
exchanged for stamps,

23:34.913 --> 23:36.665
but they could also be sold for cash.

23:36.957 --> 23:40.544
Now, he could buy a coupon in Italy,
for let's say, a dollar.

23:40.627 --> 23:44.464
He'd ship it to the United States
and sell it for, say, $6.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.509
That's a 500% return
on your investment.

23:47.592 --> 23:50.470
Trust me, this deal you can't lose.

23:50.804 --> 23:53.515
Now all Carlo needs is seed money.

23:53.598 --> 23:56.059
I know, I know I owe you the money.
I--

23:56.309 --> 23:59.646
It's not the first time
he's pitched a get-rich-quick scheme

23:59.729 --> 24:01.773
so it's not an easy sell at first.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.609
No, no, no.
This is better than the last idea.

24:05.110 --> 24:07.571
And the time before that, si.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.575
Carlo persists,
and finally gains some traction.

24:12.242 --> 24:13.076
Grazie.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.244
You won't regret it.

24:14.327 --> 24:17.414
I'll take you for dinner. Where?
Chinese. Okay.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.918
[man] No, Tory,
you're not supposed to leave.

24:22.002 --> 24:24.337
[in normal voice] Oh, yeah, I do.
My character would leave.

24:24.421 --> 24:25.547
[people laughing]

24:25.630 --> 24:28.300
He wouldn't sit there
and wait for the cops to come.

24:28.884 --> 24:30.844
[chuckles] I like this guy. He's funny.

24:33.180 --> 24:34.764
In Carlo's first deal,

24:34.848 --> 24:38.143
he gets 18 investors
to give him a hundred bucks each.

24:38.518 --> 24:41.897
He buys coupons in Italy
and sells them in the US.

24:41.980 --> 24:45.859
Each of the investors gets paid
50 bucks more than they put in.

24:46.193 --> 24:49.738
And Carlo pockets $6,300
of easy money.

24:52.657 --> 24:55.619
[man] Clear set. Okay, Tory,
you've made your first big score.

24:55.702 --> 24:57.454
You're gonna unpack all of it.

24:57.537 --> 25:00.207
-So, I'm gonna walk over.
-[man] Yeah, that's right.

25:01.499 --> 25:02.834
-Pop it?
-Uh-huh.

25:05.295 --> 25:06.254
Carlo's happy.

25:06.338 --> 25:09.466
And with a 50% return,
his investors are, too.

25:10.759 --> 25:11.635
[phone rings]

25:12.219 --> 25:15.972
Word gets out, and now basically
everyone on the Eastern seaboard

25:16.056 --> 25:17.599
wants a piece of the action.

25:18.099 --> 25:19.726
[in Italian accent] This is beautiful!

25:20.310 --> 25:23.980
Soon Carlo has over seven
and a half thousand investors.

25:24.064 --> 25:25.982
You're gonna make so much money!

25:26.691 --> 25:29.027
Totaling $2.5 million.

25:29.819 --> 25:32.656
You're gonna tell all of your friends.
And your mama.

25:32.739 --> 25:33.949
[indistinct chatter over phone]

25:34.032 --> 25:35.450
Wait, don't tell your mama.

25:35.533 --> 25:37.702
But he also has a big problem.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.290
[man] Cut. Is that real whiskey?

25:42.832 --> 25:45.168
There weren't enough
reply coupons in the world

25:45.252 --> 25:47.963
to repay investors,
let alone turn a profit.

25:51.549 --> 25:53.927
And that's when Carlo had a second idea:

25:54.511 --> 25:56.805
[man] Okay, Tory,
now for the light bulb moment.

26:00.433 --> 26:01.268
Nice.

26:01.685 --> 26:05.146
Turn this legitimate business venture
into a huge con.

26:06.690 --> 26:10.860
His idea: Stop trading coupons,
but keep taking the money.

26:12.153 --> 26:15.782
He makes investors think he's using
their cash to buy coupons,

26:15.865 --> 26:19.536
but instead, he uses it to pay off
an earlier group of investors

26:19.619 --> 26:21.788
and pockets the rest for himself.

26:22.330 --> 26:25.000
But the latest group still need
to be paid.

26:25.125 --> 26:29.212
So, Carlo gets a new,
larger group of investors, and so on.

26:30.297 --> 26:33.300
Unlike a legit business,
nothing's being built,

26:33.383 --> 26:37.679
produced, bought or sold.
And for a while, everyone wins.

26:39.973 --> 26:44.060
In just eight months, Carlo was estimated
to have taken $20 million.

26:44.269 --> 26:48.106
In today's dollar amount,
that would be 220 million.

26:49.149 --> 26:50.942
But Carlo can't relax.

26:51.067 --> 26:53.737
He's gotta consistently
recruit new investors

26:53.820 --> 26:56.615
while keeping his existing creditors
at bay.

26:57.741 --> 26:59.034
[man] Okay, cue the phone.

26:59.117 --> 27:00.368
[phone rings]

27:00.452 --> 27:03.246
Now, Tory, it's one of your investors,
and she's pissed.

27:04.122 --> 27:05.707
[Kari] Where's my money? Where is it?

27:05.790 --> 27:07.834
-Hey, ciao, Kari.
-Where is my money?

27:07.917 --> 27:11.338
No, no, no. Don't worry.
No, no, no, we'll get your money.

27:11.421 --> 27:13.006
-Where is my money?
-Don't worry.

27:13.089 --> 27:14.466
When have I ever let you down?

27:14.549 --> 27:15.842
-Well...
-There was that one.

27:15.925 --> 27:17.302
Maybe that time in Cabo?

27:17.385 --> 27:19.220
-But-- That's all.
-That time in Alaska.

27:19.304 --> 27:20.388
Right. Okay. Sure.

27:20.472 --> 27:23.099
You said you needed cash
for that operation or something.

27:24.309 --> 27:28.438
Every day, Carlo's need for investors
gets exponentially larger.

27:29.648 --> 27:32.859
Finally the day comes
where he can't find enough...

27:33.610 --> 27:36.029
and the whole pyramid
comes crashing down.

27:38.490 --> 27:42.911
Eight months after he launched,
Carlo can't sustain his scam anymore.

27:42.994 --> 27:44.662
...nothing. I mean...

27:44.746 --> 27:46.915
[man] Okay, now you realize the game's up.

27:47.082 --> 27:49.709
Stand, grab the money and split.

27:55.924 --> 27:57.634
Wait. Go back. Grab that statue.

28:00.678 --> 28:02.263
[Kari] You hear me? Tory?

28:02.931 --> 28:03.765
Tory?

28:04.182 --> 28:05.600
[man] Okay, people, that's a wrap.

28:06.601 --> 28:10.271
[Tory] Unfortunately for Carlo,
the law catches up with him.

28:10.355 --> 28:11.564
He lands in prison,

28:11.981 --> 28:14.567
and most of his investors
lose their money.

28:16.069 --> 28:17.946
What's the moral of the story?

28:18.029 --> 28:20.115
If it's too good to be true,
it probably is,

28:20.198 --> 28:23.952
especially if you're dealing with money.
All right, now how does this scam rate?

28:24.035 --> 28:28.832
How much did Carlo take?
$220 million.

28:28.915 --> 28:30.375
How long did he operate for?

28:31.126 --> 28:34.212
Eight months.
Not very long but he took a lot.

28:34.295 --> 28:35.130
Originality?

28:35.547 --> 28:37.173
This is where it gets interesting.

28:37.257 --> 28:38.967
And he's probably gonna score high,

28:39.050 --> 28:39.926
because Carlo,

28:40.802 --> 28:42.303
better known as Charles Ponzi,

28:42.387 --> 28:45.974
gave his name to one
of the most notorious scams of all time.

28:47.100 --> 28:51.146
The so-called Ponzi Scheme was used
to its most devastating effect

28:51.229 --> 28:53.648
by Wall Street fraudster Bernie Madoff.

28:54.649 --> 28:58.111
He ripped off a staggering 65 billion
from his investors.

28:58.570 --> 29:01.990
He owes them the money,
but Charles Ponzi for the idea.

29:03.867 --> 29:06.619
[Grant] Okay,
so we've all heard of a Ponzi scheme,

29:06.703 --> 29:10.415
but my next contender is one
you probably don't know about.

29:15.003 --> 29:17.505
The sight of this iconic LA building

29:17.589 --> 29:19.841
is enough to get
any car buff's heart racing.

29:20.425 --> 29:22.051
It's the Petersen Automotive Museum.

29:24.721 --> 29:28.850
Some of its finest treasures are
in a hidden underground vault.

29:29.768 --> 29:33.563
But even in this illustrious company,
one car stands out.

29:35.273 --> 29:36.399
Its name:

29:37.859 --> 29:38.693
The Dale.

29:40.361 --> 29:42.071
-The what?
-Is that thing for real?

29:42.655 --> 29:44.407
-You've never heard of the Dale?
-[Tory] No.

29:44.991 --> 29:47.202
I know a lemon when I see one,
though.

29:47.327 --> 29:50.622
All right, the Dale was the most
talked about car of its era.

29:50.705 --> 29:53.583
If this was such a big hit,
how come we haven't heard of it?

29:53.666 --> 29:56.169
And how come
we don't see any of them on the road?

29:56.252 --> 29:57.629
You got a lot of questions.

29:57.712 --> 30:00.673
But believe me,
this is just the beginning.

30:02.425 --> 30:04.177
The driving force behind the Dale

30:04.761 --> 30:07.388
was street-smart entrepreneur
Liz Carmichael.

30:07.972 --> 30:11.684
We hope there'll be a quarter million
Dales on the road by 1978.

30:13.853 --> 30:16.981
Now, Liz Carmichael wasn't quite
what she seemed.

30:17.065 --> 30:18.733
She was born Jerry Michael.

30:20.026 --> 30:21.069
More on that later.

30:22.070 --> 30:24.989
But that's the least surprising thing
about the tale of the Dale.

30:26.741 --> 30:28.660
To understand the scale of this scam,

30:29.244 --> 30:32.038
we need a quick lesson
in global geopolitics.

30:33.081 --> 30:37.836
In 1973, the US supports Israel
in the Yom Kippur War.

30:39.337 --> 30:42.298
The Arab countries retaliate
with an oil embargo.

30:43.800 --> 30:47.220
By 1974, US gas prices are skyrocketing,

30:47.720 --> 30:50.598
and shortages mean
long lines and rationing.

30:51.099 --> 30:53.935
[TV announcer] ...remarkable scenes
at gas stations all over the country.

30:54.519 --> 30:56.229
Fuel prices have already doubled...

30:56.312 --> 30:58.523
[Grant] America is crying out
for an answer

30:59.107 --> 31:00.567
And this guy, Dale Clifft,

31:00.650 --> 31:03.903
has just invented
a three-wheeled vehicle in his garage.

31:04.487 --> 31:06.865
Mr. Clifft, Dale.

31:06.948 --> 31:08.032
Liz thinks his car

31:08.116 --> 31:10.034
could be a solution to the gas crisis.

31:10.118 --> 31:11.452
You're serious?

31:11.536 --> 31:14.455
Liz offers a big payout
to mass-produce his vehicle.

31:14.539 --> 31:15.707
[laughing]

31:16.249 --> 31:19.085
The clincher?
The car will bear his name.

31:19.168 --> 31:20.420
To the Dale?

31:21.170 --> 31:22.839
[chuckles] The Dale.

31:23.298 --> 31:25.800
With Clifft on board, Liz is in business.

31:28.011 --> 31:31.222
She sets up the 20th Century
Motor Corporation in LA,

31:32.098 --> 31:34.392
puts a Dale prototype on display,

31:34.684 --> 31:36.728
and goes into marketing overdrive.

31:37.770 --> 31:39.814
We've been all over the papers,

31:40.398 --> 31:41.649
radio, television.

31:41.733 --> 31:45.028
[man over TV] Now, here's the ultimate:
A three-wheeled car.

31:45.111 --> 31:46.321
[Grant] From The Price Is Right...

31:47.322 --> 31:50.158
to the press, people can't get enough.

31:50.241 --> 31:52.994
This little three-wheeler is gonna
take America by storm.

31:54.287 --> 31:56.080
Seventy mpg, that's right.

31:57.165 --> 31:58.207
Eighty-five miles per hour.

31:59.292 --> 32:00.209
It's unbreakable.

32:00.293 --> 32:03.296
The Dale is going
to revolutionize the car industry.

32:03.379 --> 32:05.798
[man over TV] A new concept
in automotive design.

32:05.882 --> 32:07.425
And I'm offering you...

32:08.176 --> 32:10.678
-a piece of the action.
-This is a goldmine.

32:10.803 --> 32:12.513
[Grant] Investors buy in.

32:12.597 --> 32:14.223
Pre-orders stack up.

32:14.307 --> 32:16.309
I'll send the paperwork right out to you.

32:16.809 --> 32:19.771
The Dale is speeding
into automotive history.

32:19.854 --> 32:20.688
[Liz] Bye.

32:22.523 --> 32:26.736
So, Liz markets the Dale as capable
of getting 70 miles per gallon.

32:26.819 --> 32:30.365
Now, in 1974, the number one selling car,
the Ford Pinto,

32:30.448 --> 32:33.242
got less than half that
at 34 miles per gallon.

32:33.743 --> 32:36.829
I mean, the best hybrids today are
only getting 50 miles per gallon.

32:36.913 --> 32:40.124
Can you imagine, back then,
a car getting 70 miles per gallon?

32:40.208 --> 32:41.292
That'd be a game-changer.

32:42.293 --> 32:46.047
The marketing material offers
a futuristic car for the space age.

32:46.673 --> 32:49.384
As well as
its revolutionary fuel efficiency,

32:49.467 --> 32:51.469
it promises great handling...

32:52.053 --> 32:53.721
superior strength and safety...

32:54.764 --> 32:56.391
more bang for your buck.

32:56.724 --> 33:00.645
And all at a fraction of the cost
of any other car on the market.

33:01.229 --> 33:05.733
[man] It sells for $1,969
and gets 70 miles to the gallon.

33:05.817 --> 33:09.070
[Grant]
It's unveiled at the 1975 LA Auto Show.

33:09.570 --> 33:12.949
Liz announces the assembly line
is up and running.

33:13.950 --> 33:15.743
She basks in the limelight,

33:16.327 --> 33:17.704
and the sky's the limit.

33:18.204 --> 33:19.872
[man over TV]
The straight-talking promoter

33:19.956 --> 33:20.790
is Liz Carmichael.

33:21.374 --> 33:23.793
We are going to build a car in '75.

33:23.876 --> 33:26.879
Now, Liz was a maverick
and her claim that she was gonna

33:26.963 --> 33:31.300
break Detroit's stranglehold on the
automotive industry could not be ignored.

33:31.801 --> 33:35.471
According to Leslie Kendall,
curator of the Petersen Automotive Museum,

33:35.555 --> 33:37.348
Liz had impeccable timing.

33:38.808 --> 33:43.062
Keeping in mind that this was
during the depths of the gas crisis...

33:43.146 --> 33:44.230
the stage was set.

33:44.439 --> 33:46.357
When Liz came on, she had her car.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.693
It was the perfect storm.

33:49.610 --> 33:52.447
There was just one problem
with this car of the future.

33:53.448 --> 33:55.700
It was all a giant lemon-shaped lie.

33:57.493 --> 33:58.995
But before I tell you why...

34:01.622 --> 34:03.082
here's Kari's final contender.

34:04.917 --> 34:06.210
Let me take you back.

34:06.586 --> 34:08.588
Paris in the roaring '20s.

34:08.671 --> 34:13.760
We're talking about the Paris of Cocteau,
Hemingway, Breton, Picasso.

34:14.343 --> 34:15.887
And the greatest artist of all,

34:16.471 --> 34:18.389
Count Victor Lustig.

34:19.599 --> 34:20.683
Con artist, that is.

34:22.393 --> 34:23.978
Lustig's masterwork?

34:24.062 --> 34:27.690
Selling one of
the most iconic structures... twice.

34:31.611 --> 34:34.906
In 1925, Lustig's catching up on the news

34:35.615 --> 34:37.408
and he notices an article

34:37.492 --> 34:40.411
about the rising costs
of maintaining the Eiffel Tower.

34:41.788 --> 34:44.373
The tower had been built 35 years before,

34:44.874 --> 34:47.960
but many Parisians considered it
a costly eyesore.

34:48.461 --> 34:52.632
And it's hard to believe now, but some
even advocated for its demolition.

34:55.218 --> 34:57.386
Lustig sniffs an opportunity.

34:57.637 --> 35:00.681
He has a forger create
fake government stationary,

35:00.765 --> 35:03.684
then sends letters out
to six big scrap-metal dealers,

35:03.768 --> 35:07.730
inviting them to a meeting
at one of the city's grandest hotels.

35:08.606 --> 35:11.484
They all turn up to be greeted by Lustig,

35:11.818 --> 35:16.405
posing as the deputy director general
of the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs.

35:18.074 --> 35:19.117
Bonjour.

35:19.617 --> 35:21.244
He gives them the pitch.

35:21.327 --> 35:24.622
The maintenance is way too expensive,
and the tower's gonna be scrapped.

35:25.331 --> 35:27.625
"And sold to the highest bidder."

35:28.209 --> 35:33.214
But importantly, to avoid public outcry,
they have to keep it a secret.

35:34.048 --> 35:35.007
[shushing]

35:35.591 --> 35:37.927
All the while,
Lustig has his eye on the dealer

35:38.010 --> 35:39.804
he thinks is the most vulnerable:

35:40.388 --> 35:43.641
Andre Poisson. Or in English, Andrew Fish.

35:44.433 --> 35:48.312
He's desperate for acceptance
into the Parisian business big leagues.

35:48.813 --> 35:51.524
Fish nibbles the bait, but he's hesitant.

35:51.774 --> 35:55.027
He's suspicious that something's
just not quite right.

35:58.197 --> 36:01.951
Lustig tells Fish
he's only a poor government official

36:02.034 --> 36:06.372
who's looking to supplement his income.
In other words, he wants a bribe.

36:07.456 --> 36:09.750
"Ah. Okay, I get it."

36:10.334 --> 36:12.879
Ironically, it's this corrupt request

36:12.962 --> 36:16.215
that convinces Fish
he must be a real politician,

36:16.299 --> 36:18.551
So, he hands over the money
and wins the bid.

36:19.260 --> 36:22.513
Fish is told he can now
buy the Eiffel Tower.

36:23.139 --> 36:24.557
Hurrah!

36:24.640 --> 36:27.268
[Kari] He's delighted.
And including the bribe,

36:27.351 --> 36:30.938
he hands out almost a million dollars
in today's money.

36:31.480 --> 36:35.776
A fake bill of sale exchanges hands
and Lustig promptly skips town.

36:36.611 --> 36:40.740
Now, can you imagine that moment
when he realizes he's been scammed?

36:41.324 --> 36:45.036
He has all his workers out there,
they start dismantling the Eiffel Tower,

36:45.119 --> 36:46.787
and the authorities come by.

36:46.871 --> 36:48.623
"Uh, what are you doing?"

36:48.706 --> 36:49.790
[Kari chuckles]

36:51.667 --> 36:52.960
He was way too embarrassed

36:53.044 --> 36:55.588
to actually report Lustig
to the authorities.

36:55.671 --> 36:57.840
So, this is where it nails it for me

36:57.924 --> 37:01.385
that Lustig is the con artist
of con artists.

37:01.594 --> 37:03.512
He realizes he got away with it...

37:04.263 --> 37:09.060
so one month later,
he comes back and does it all again.

37:09.477 --> 37:10.645
Bonjour.

37:11.771 --> 37:16.150
Lustig is considered one
of the smoothest con artists of all time.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.610
After he finished in Paris,

37:17.693 --> 37:20.905
he moved on to America
and even conned Al Capone.

37:20.988 --> 37:22.323
Al Capone?

37:22.406 --> 37:24.742
You have to be brave to con Al Capone.

37:24.825 --> 37:28.579
All right, well, how much money
did this Eiffel Tower job give him?

37:28.663 --> 37:32.250
In today's money,
he sold the tower for a million dollars.

37:32.333 --> 37:34.085
Just the first time he sold it.

37:34.168 --> 37:36.712
Okay. So, how long of a period
did he do the scam?

37:36.796 --> 37:40.174
He did the scam for two months
before he moved on to America.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.843
In fact,
he kept scamming for another ten years

37:42.927 --> 37:45.554
before he got caught counterfeiting
and sent to Alcatraz.

37:45.638 --> 37:48.516
Your scam'll take a hit,
it's not original.

37:48.599 --> 37:53.312
George Parker, in the 1900s, actually
sold the Brooklyn Bridge many times.

37:53.396 --> 37:55.022
Maybe that's where he got his idea.

37:57.608 --> 37:59.735
Everyone's talking about the Dale.

38:00.236 --> 38:03.155
[Grant] When we left Liz Carmichael
back in 1975...

38:03.698 --> 38:06.951
We've got up-front orders of $2 million.

38:07.034 --> 38:11.330
[Grant] she was raking in a fortune
on the promise of a revolutionary new car.

38:11.414 --> 38:13.249
And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

38:13.332 --> 38:15.876
Investors lined up
for a piece of the action.

38:16.377 --> 38:18.754
You're gonna need over 100 dealerships.

38:19.672 --> 38:22.216
With its groundbreaking fuel efficiency,

38:22.425 --> 38:24.093
space-age technology,

38:24.510 --> 38:26.262
and bargain-basement price,

38:27.555 --> 38:30.558
Liz was about to save America
from the oil crisis

38:30.641 --> 38:32.935
and change the face of motoring.

38:33.853 --> 38:37.606
We hope there will be a quarter million
Dales on the road by 1978.

38:37.690 --> 38:38.941
But hang on a minute.

38:39.442 --> 38:41.736
Most people have never even heard
of the Dale.

38:41.819 --> 38:43.446
Doesn't that seem a little odd?

38:43.946 --> 38:47.950
Well, it turns out the Dale
wasn't all it was cracked up to be.

38:48.659 --> 38:50.536
The Dale at the Petersen Museum...

38:52.455 --> 38:53.664
does not run.

38:54.623 --> 38:56.834
The thing is held together
with wood screws...

38:58.127 --> 38:59.587
probably some Elmer's glue.

39:00.171 --> 39:01.047
Elmer's glue?

39:01.547 --> 39:02.631
You're kidding me.

39:02.715 --> 39:06.635
I've heard rumors it was powered
by a BMW motorcycle engine...

39:07.803 --> 39:09.638
it was powered by a lawn mower engine.

39:10.931 --> 39:14.894
You know, you look at this-- At this car
and it's such a piece of garbage.

39:14.977 --> 39:17.063
This can't have been powered by much.

39:17.855 --> 39:19.690
But from a distance, it looked good.

39:20.608 --> 39:22.860
You remember that prototype on display

39:22.943 --> 39:25.404
in the 20th Century Motor Car
Company showroom?

39:26.447 --> 39:28.574
And that one at the LA Auto Show?

39:29.325 --> 39:30.743
[TV announcer] ...the Dale...

39:30.826 --> 39:33.954
[Grant] And the one that was
the big prize on The Price Is Right?

39:34.997 --> 39:36.207
Well, here's the thing:

39:36.791 --> 39:41.420
Those three cars constitute the sum total
of all Dales ever built.

39:42.129 --> 39:45.716
And to use Liz's words,
that's just the tip of the iceberg.

39:45.800 --> 39:48.928
Because only one of those
even came close to working.

39:49.428 --> 39:51.889
The only "operational Dale"
that was ever built,

39:51.972 --> 39:53.641
the chassis was made of wood,

39:53.724 --> 39:56.644
the body was theoretically
made of Rigidex,

39:56.727 --> 40:00.272
which Liz described
as a rocket structural resin,

40:00.356 --> 40:03.651
pound for pound
10 or 20 times stronger than steel.

40:04.235 --> 40:05.861
This was all a bunch of nonsense.

40:05.945 --> 40:08.406
It was a fiberglass body
on a wooden chassis.

40:08.489 --> 40:11.242
The front wheels
didn't even steer together.

40:13.536 --> 40:16.330
That was the degree
that she fooled people.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.457
She was able to do it
with a car like that.

40:21.168 --> 40:23.754
[Grant]
Liz was a con woman through and through.

40:24.213 --> 40:26.799
In a previous life, she'd been a con man.

40:26.882 --> 40:29.844
Jerry Dean Michael was wanted
for counterfeiting.

40:30.594 --> 40:32.721
By the time she started the Dale scam,

40:32.805 --> 40:36.308
she'd already been on the run
from the law for 15 years.

40:37.977 --> 40:39.728
Okay. So, let me get this straight.

40:39.812 --> 40:43.899
There's a woman who was born a man
is now selling a three-wheeled car

40:43.983 --> 40:46.777
-with a wooden chassis and crappy engine.
-[Grant] That's right.

40:46.861 --> 40:49.864
And all that other BS
about getting 70 miles per gallon,

40:49.947 --> 40:52.158
and all the other
incredible selling points:

40:52.241 --> 40:54.952
-Total fiction.
-How long did she pull this off?

40:55.035 --> 40:56.078
[Grant] Nine months,

40:56.162 --> 40:58.706
but then that's when things
really started going south.

40:59.206 --> 41:01.125
[indistinct chatter]

41:01.208 --> 41:03.252
[man] Let me get my money.
That's all I want.

41:03.335 --> 41:05.880
[Grant] Before the end of the year,
buyers and investors

41:05.963 --> 41:08.507
began to suspect they'd been had.

41:08.591 --> 41:11.927
We got swindled. That's what...
I think what happened to the whole deal.

41:13.220 --> 41:17.266
[Grant] Liz claimed to have 100 workers
on a production line in Burbank.

41:17.349 --> 41:20.311
But when investigators took a look
for themselves...

41:20.811 --> 41:22.897
no factory, no car.

41:25.441 --> 41:27.443
Liz was selling an illusion.

41:28.194 --> 41:29.111
It's a sham.

41:30.488 --> 41:32.990
It all began to unravel
at about the same time.

41:34.658 --> 41:37.661
[agent] We're investigators
with the California Securities Commission.

41:37.745 --> 41:39.914
[Leslie] People that had been buying
dealer franchises

41:39.997 --> 41:41.707
weren't seeing their cars.

41:41.832 --> 41:43.918
Take these detectives to my office,
please.

41:44.001 --> 41:46.629
And a lot of the people
that worked for Liz

41:46.712 --> 41:48.005
weren't seeing paychecks.

41:48.088 --> 41:49.715
Offer them coffee.

41:50.633 --> 41:53.093
Everybody got mad at her all at once.

41:54.220 --> 41:55.596
She blew town...

41:57.932 --> 41:59.642
really, really quickly.

42:03.938 --> 42:05.397
[Grant] She fled to Texas,

42:05.481 --> 42:08.359
but eventually the law caught up
with her in,

42:08.442 --> 42:11.487
believe it or not, a town called Dale.

42:12.071 --> 42:16.700
She was convicted of fraud,
sent to prison and died in 2004.

42:17.243 --> 42:19.787
And as for the car's creator, Dale Clifft,

42:20.287 --> 42:22.206
he barely saw a dime.

42:22.289 --> 42:24.875
Poor Dale Clifft,
he didn't get much out of it.

42:24.959 --> 42:27.169
I think he netted
about a thousand dollars,

42:27.753 --> 42:29.755
and he passed away
very shortly after that.

42:30.256 --> 42:35.302
Most accounts estimate Liz's take
at about $2 million.

42:35.886 --> 42:37.429
How long did it all last?

42:37.513 --> 42:40.849
Well, the Dale scam was over
in just nine months.

42:41.684 --> 42:45.437
As for originality,
even though the car didn't move...

42:45.729 --> 42:48.440
the scam itself should
be pretty hard to beat.

42:50.109 --> 42:54.405
You know, I know it was made of wood,
but it looked like a real car to me.

42:54.488 --> 42:55.322
You would have bought one.

42:55.406 --> 42:58.367
I mean, as far as weird '70s cars go,
it looks legit.

42:58.450 --> 43:01.161
All right, why don't we average
all three criteria

43:01.245 --> 43:02.454
and see who the winner is?

43:03.998 --> 43:05.040
[Tory] Where you find greed...

43:05.124 --> 43:07.710
[in Italian accent]
You're gonna make so much money!

43:08.294 --> 43:11.130
[Tory] ingenuity and gullibility,
you'll find a scam.

43:11.714 --> 43:14.049
We've scored them against the criteria:

43:14.133 --> 43:15.593
Value in today's money,

43:15.676 --> 43:17.011
duration of the scam

43:17.094 --> 43:18.304
and originality.

43:18.887 --> 43:20.180
And here's how they rank:

43:21.140 --> 43:23.350
At number six, the Swiss Gigolo.

43:23.434 --> 43:27.521
He managed to swindle $10 million,
but as far as originality...

43:27.605 --> 43:28.606
So sweet.

43:28.689 --> 43:30.816
this scam artist got one out of ten.

43:31.442 --> 43:33.611
Number five, the Eiffel Tower.

43:34.153 --> 43:36.822
He was able to make a million dollars
in today's money,

43:36.905 --> 43:39.199
but the scam only lasted two months.

43:39.992 --> 43:41.869
At number four, the rainmaker.

43:41.952 --> 43:43.120
[thunder rumbling]

43:43.203 --> 43:46.582
Hatfield scammed
from town to town for 25 years.

43:47.416 --> 43:51.670
But that's a lot of time and effort
to only make around 250 grand.

43:52.921 --> 43:54.506
Coming in at third, the Dale.

43:54.590 --> 43:57.551
The whole thing is held together
with wood screws,

43:57.635 --> 43:58.761
probably Elmer's glue.

43:58.844 --> 44:01.013
Pulling off a scam like that
for nine months

44:01.096 --> 44:04.016
is impressive and scored high
for originality.

44:04.433 --> 44:06.143
-Number two...
-Place your bets.

44:06.226 --> 44:07.770
The Cutter Gang.

44:07.853 --> 44:10.689
They came up with a new way
to fool casino security.

44:12.274 --> 44:13.817
We have a situation at Table 1.

44:14.401 --> 44:16.320
It gets a nine out of ten
for originality.

44:17.321 --> 44:20.199
And they cashed in a total
of about $50 million.

44:20.783 --> 44:23.035
And our number one scam artist:

44:23.619 --> 44:27.706
Charles Ponzi,
who made a cool $220 million.

44:27.790 --> 44:28.957
And his smooth-talking...

44:29.041 --> 44:31.877
You're gonna tell all your friends
and your mama.

44:31.960 --> 44:35.381
money-making scheme
gets a ten out of ten for originality.

44:35.464 --> 44:37.675
Plus it's still in use to this day.

44:38.258 --> 44:40.761
So, that's how
our six scam artists stacked up.

44:41.929 --> 44:43.972
Ponzi. You know,
when you think about it,

44:44.056 --> 44:47.935
the first three scams are the only three
that are completely original.

44:48.519 --> 44:49.728
And Ponzi in particular,

44:49.812 --> 44:52.439
most successful financial scam
of all time.

44:52.523 --> 44:54.608
No wonder they still use the name.
