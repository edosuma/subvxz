WEBVTT

00:05.701 --> 00:07.616
Unprompted Mandarin?

00:07.659 --> 00:08.834
What do you want?

00:08.878 --> 00:11.315
I already told you
we are not getting a monkey.

00:11.359 --> 00:13.317
We already have to take care
of your grandma.

00:13.361 --> 00:15.319
Fine, but there's an autograph
signing at the mall this week,

00:15.363 --> 00:16.494
and it's during
school hours.

00:16.538 --> 00:17.495
No skipping school.

00:17.539 --> 00:18.931
Even if the building's
on fire,

00:18.975 --> 00:20.977
you wait for the bell
and die with honor.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.153
But it's my new
favorite basketball
player -- Allen Iverson!

00:24.241 --> 00:25.286
A.I.?

00:26.548 --> 00:28.724
"The Answer"?
The All-Star for the Sixers.

00:28.767 --> 00:31.118
Got a crossover so smooth,it'll put a baby in your sister?

00:31.161 --> 00:34.512
Connie? Don't bring my sister
into this!

00:34.556 --> 00:36.340
Come on, Dad, please?
You love hoops.

00:36.384 --> 00:38.690
And you know how hard I've beenworking on this college stuff.

00:38.734 --> 00:41.258
Sorry, but I'm with your motheron this one. No skipping school.

00:41.302 --> 00:44.087
But I think you should leave
if there's a fire.

00:44.131 --> 00:46.176
You smell smoke,
you run.

00:46.220 --> 00:48.178
C'mon, Ma,
it's just half a day.

00:48.222 --> 00:49.353
This is so unfair!

00:49.397 --> 00:50.311
Unfair?

00:50.354 --> 00:52.139
Wimbledon requiring
Pete Sampras

00:52.182 --> 00:54.576
to play wearing a shirt
is unfair.

00:54.619 --> 00:58.710
Denzel having to act
wearing a shirt is unfair.

00:58.754 --> 01:02.584
Me having to complete
a stupid academic practicum

01:02.627 --> 01:04.890
in order to become
teacher boss...

01:04.934 --> 01:06.544
definitely unfair.

01:06.588 --> 01:07.937
What's a practicum?

01:07.980 --> 01:09.373
I have to spend 100 hours

01:09.417 --> 01:11.375
shadowing a teacher
at some school

01:11.419 --> 01:12.768
in order to finish
my degree.

01:12.811 --> 01:17.381
Apparently, "practicum" is Latinfor "waste Jessica's time."

01:17.425 --> 01:18.382
Practicum?

01:18.426 --> 01:19.731
We're talking about practicum?
Really?

01:19.775 --> 01:21.255
I'm in here
trying to get an autograph,

01:21.298 --> 01:22.778
and we're talking
about practicum?

01:22.821 --> 01:24.214
Practicum?!

01:24.954 --> 01:26.390
100 hours is a lot.

01:26.434 --> 01:27.348
For everyone involved.

01:27.391 --> 01:30.351
Yes, but in order
to achieve your goals,

01:30.394 --> 01:33.180
you need to keep your head downand stay the course.

01:33.223 --> 01:34.920
Look at
your brother Evan.

01:34.964 --> 01:36.270
He wants to be
Doctor-President,

01:36.313 --> 01:39.534
and he has neverveered
from the path.

01:39.577 --> 01:42.276
He's predictable,
reliable --

01:42.319 --> 01:43.407
Aloha!

01:46.758 --> 01:49.021
What have you done
to your neck?!

01:49.065 --> 01:50.719
It's ruined!

01:50.762 --> 01:53.200

Evan, why do you have
sea creatures on your neck?!

02:10.434 --> 02:13.045
Oh, my puka shells?
Geoff got me into them.

02:13.089 --> 02:14.264
Geoff? Who's Geoff?

02:14.308 --> 02:15.396
He's my friend
from school.

02:15.439 --> 02:17.398
He spells his name
G-E-O-F-F.

02:17.441 --> 02:18.529
Isn't that cool?

02:18.573 --> 02:19.965
G-off?

02:20.009 --> 02:20.749
Jeff.

02:20.792 --> 02:22.446
G-off.
Jeff.

02:22.490 --> 02:24.187
How come you never
mentioned him before?

02:24.231 --> 02:26.233
I guess that's 8th grade
for you, always moving.

02:26.276 --> 02:28.409
Well, I better go,
or else I won't get a seat

02:28.452 --> 02:29.540
in the back of the bus.

02:29.584 --> 02:31.368
Then I'll have to sit
on the wheel hump.

02:36.373 --> 02:39.637
Puka shells, back of the bus,
single-strap backpack.

02:39.681 --> 02:41.204
This is not like Evan.

02:41.248 --> 02:42.901
What is going on with him
at school?

02:42.945 --> 02:45.730
How would I know? We don't go
to the same school anymore.

02:46.644 --> 02:47.863
I'm in high school now.

02:48.864 --> 02:51.258
I graduated junior high
last June?

02:52.563 --> 02:54.391
There was a ceremonywhere you shouted out, "Boring"?

02:54.435 --> 02:56.263
Oh, right.

02:56.306 --> 02:58.917
That poor girl sang
"The Greatest Love of All."

02:58.961 --> 03:01.877
Don't try Whitney
if you can't do Whitney.

03:01.920 --> 03:03.444
Okay.

03:03.487 --> 03:05.924
You're worried about Evan
because of puka shells?

03:05.968 --> 03:08.318
Puka shells
lead to shady friends,

03:08.362 --> 03:11.495
which leads to distraction,
which leads to bad grades!

03:11.539 --> 03:14.672
Next thing you know,Evan won't be Doctor-President.

03:14.716 --> 03:15.673
I don't know, Mom.

03:15.717 --> 03:17.371
Puka shells
are just casual beachwear

03:17.414 --> 03:18.894
that also work
in the city.

03:18.937 --> 03:21.070
Well, you know what else works
in the city?

03:21.113 --> 03:22.637
Institutional racism.

03:29.426 --> 03:30.688
Nice form!

03:30.732 --> 03:32.037
The sleeve helps.

03:32.081 --> 03:34.692
It's good for my ligaments,
and sometimes it's a napkin.

03:34.736 --> 03:37.260
Well, sorry we can't let you
skip school, but I amproud

03:37.304 --> 03:40.220
of all the hard work
you've been doing for college.

03:43.745 --> 03:45.486
An A.I. jersey!

03:45.529 --> 03:47.444
I know you're a fan
of "The Big Response."

03:47.488 --> 03:48.271
It's "The Answer."

03:48.315 --> 03:49.838
Oh. That's catchier.

03:49.881 --> 03:51.143
Thanks, Dad.

03:51.187 --> 03:53.537
Oh. I've been thinking about
how to help pay for tuition.

03:53.581 --> 03:56.323
Four words --
basketball scholarship.

03:56.366 --> 03:57.454
Okay.

03:57.498 --> 03:59.456
I'm gonna put together
a reel of all my hoop skills

03:59.500 --> 04:02.329
and send it to Georgetown,
Duke, Kentucky...

04:04.548 --> 04:07.682
Oh, son, this is the hard part
of being a dad

04:07.725 --> 04:09.249
they never show on TV.

04:11.207 --> 04:14.558
The truth is, you are unlikelyto get a basketball scholarship.

04:14.602 --> 04:16.299
You are a clumsy boy
with a heart of gold.

04:17.605 --> 04:19.433
Maybe if you hustle,
you can get a cup of coffee

04:19.476 --> 04:20.999
in some third-tier
Euro league,

04:21.043 --> 04:23.001
but even then,
you'll just be a curiosity,

04:23.045 --> 04:25.352
an Asian spectacle
for the Slavs to jeer at.

04:25.395 --> 04:26.570
I don't want that.

04:26.614 --> 04:28.442
No.

04:28.485 --> 04:30.313
No, you don't.

04:31.401 --> 04:32.968
But what you do have

04:33.011 --> 04:36.014
is a great imagination,
intelligence, and personality,

04:36.058 --> 04:37.712
and there's plenty
of scholarships for that.

04:37.755 --> 04:38.887
Thanks, Dad.

04:40.149 --> 04:41.106
Wait.

04:41.150 --> 04:42.934
They spelled "Iverson"
with a "Q."

04:44.153 --> 04:45.328
"Iversqn"?

04:45.372 --> 04:47.112
Is this fake?

04:47.156 --> 04:49.593
Explains why it was
in the clearance bin.

04:49.637 --> 04:52.335
That Michael Gordan jersey
makes a lot more sense now.

04:55.599 --> 04:57.906
Hunter, what kind
of a child zoo is this?

04:57.949 --> 04:59.777
You've let Evan
slip through the cracks.

04:59.821 --> 05:00.909
Evan?

05:00.952 --> 05:03.607
He's got straight A's,
a can-do attitude,

05:03.651 --> 05:04.608
making new friends.

05:04.652 --> 05:06.131
Aside from
one little detention --

05:06.175 --> 05:07.959
Detention?!

05:08.003 --> 05:10.788
Well, the whole class got it
for tardiness.

05:10.832 --> 05:12.442
The whole class?!

05:12.486 --> 05:13.922
How are you teacher boss

05:13.965 --> 05:15.706
and I still have to
take practicum?

05:15.750 --> 05:17.491
Trust me,
Evan's doing just fine.

05:17.534 --> 05:19.493
You have nothing
to worry about.

05:19.536 --> 05:20.494
False.

05:20.537 --> 05:21.843
I need you to follow him
to every class

05:21.886 --> 05:23.410
and report back to me.

05:23.453 --> 05:24.541
Be sly about it.

05:24.585 --> 05:26.630
Peek around corners.
Use binoculars.

05:26.674 --> 05:28.197
You know
what I'm talking about.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.373
I can't follow one child
all day.

05:30.417 --> 05:32.114
Who has time for that?

05:34.551 --> 05:38.512
One last Huang,
one more year.

05:39.556 --> 05:41.166
You can do this.

05:44.213 --> 05:46.824
Dad, I took your advice and
found an awesome scholarship.

05:46.868 --> 05:48.217
Oh!

05:48.260 --> 05:51.220
"The Wesley Snipes Scholarship
for Orlando Youth."

05:51.263 --> 05:53.657
Smart. Channeling some of
that "Passenger 57" money

05:53.701 --> 05:55.529
into a charitable cause.

05:55.572 --> 05:57.400
He must have
a great tax guy.

05:57.444 --> 05:58.880
The scholarship
will be enough

05:58.923 --> 06:00.534
to buy a dope-ass massage chairfor my dorm room.

06:00.577 --> 06:01.622
It's gonna be pimp.

06:01.665 --> 06:04.625
Anyways, I have to writean essay about my biggest hero.

06:04.668 --> 06:07.279
Oh. So, uh,
who do you have in mind?

06:07.323 --> 06:08.498
It was an obvious choice.

06:08.542 --> 06:10.326
A man who's really
impacted my life.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.327
I'm listening.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.329
Someone who embodies
the American dream.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.504
He came from nothing,

06:14.548 --> 06:16.506
has a tireless work ethic
and amazing hair.

06:16.550 --> 06:17.638
That doesn't just happen.

06:17.681 --> 06:19.074
That's that work ethic
you mentioned.

06:19.117 --> 06:20.858
My hero...

06:20.902 --> 06:21.903
Allen Iverson.

06:23.948 --> 06:25.863
That's great.

06:25.907 --> 06:27.561
Great choice. Yes.

06:30.085 --> 06:31.913
Alright, Geoff,
is this your card?

06:31.956 --> 06:32.914
No.

06:33.828 --> 06:35.046
Is this your card?

06:35.090 --> 06:35.830
Nope.

06:36.918 --> 06:38.876
I'm such a bad magician.

06:38.920 --> 06:41.009
Hey.
That's my card!

06:41.052 --> 06:41.836
Or amI?

06:41.879 --> 06:43.446
Dude,
how did you do that?

06:43.490 --> 06:45.840
A magician
never reveals his secrets.

06:45.883 --> 06:48.103
That's why they're not
in relationships for long.

06:48.146 --> 06:49.713
That was awesome.

06:49.757 --> 06:51.715
Hey, you should come
to my Bar Mitzvah.

06:51.759 --> 06:53.891
Really? Isn't that
for close friends and family?

06:53.935 --> 06:56.067
I mean,
we arefriends, right?

06:57.329 --> 07:00.463
One question -- how early
is too early to show up?

07:01.290 --> 07:02.944
Show up to what?

07:02.987 --> 07:04.119
Mommy?

07:04.162 --> 07:07.122
Good news, Evan.
I'm doing my practicum here.

07:07.165 --> 07:08.732
We're going to school
together!

07:10.386 --> 07:12.693
Now, which one of
you bed-wetters is G-off?

07:20.701 --> 07:22.398
You're doing
your practicum here?Isn't it great?

07:22.442 --> 07:23.921
Instead of wasting my time

07:23.965 --> 07:26.837
following dummy teachers
at some random school,

07:26.881 --> 07:29.144
I can spend my 100 hours
with you

07:29.187 --> 07:30.711
and still get credit!

07:30.754 --> 07:31.712
100 hours is a lot.

07:31.755 --> 07:33.278
A lot of fun.

07:33.322 --> 07:35.716
I guess
we could carpool together.

07:35.759 --> 07:38.414
And the field trip
permission slip process
will be streamlined.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.415
Cards?

07:39.459 --> 07:40.721
Are you playing poker?

07:40.764 --> 07:42.200
Did you put him up to this,
G-off?

07:42.244 --> 07:43.506
Uh, it's Geoff,

07:43.550 --> 07:46.204
and Evan was just showing us
some magic tricks.

07:46.248 --> 07:48.990
Trix? Like that drunk
cartoon rabbit? No.

07:49.599 --> 07:50.731
Applesauce?

07:50.774 --> 07:53.124
You know that gives you
bad boom booms.

07:57.041 --> 08:00.001
Boo-yah. Dropped off 10 meals
in under two hours.

08:00.044 --> 08:02.786
The trick is,
never put the car in "park."

08:02.830 --> 08:04.788
How would that even --So, can I take
the afternoon off?

08:04.832 --> 08:06.398
I want to work on
my hero essay.

08:06.442 --> 08:07.922
Oh. Uh, sure.

08:07.965 --> 08:10.228
Uh, are you still writing
about Allen Iverson?

08:10.272 --> 08:11.665
'Cause I was just thinking,

08:11.708 --> 08:13.797
maybe there's another hero
in your life

08:13.841 --> 08:14.798
you'd rather write about,

08:14.842 --> 08:16.452
someone closer to home?

08:17.497 --> 08:18.585
You mean Uncle Marvin?

08:18.628 --> 08:19.586
I do thank you
for your service.

08:19.629 --> 08:20.587
Oh.

08:20.630 --> 08:22.937
You want to thank me?
Enlist.

08:23.720 --> 08:26.201
I was, um, actually thinking
even closer to home.

08:26.244 --> 08:29.465
Maybe an unsung hero
you've known since birth.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.597
I don't want
to write about Mom.

08:30.640 --> 08:33.164
She already made me do that
for Mother's Day.

08:33.208 --> 08:34.165
I'll just stick with A.I.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.735
I'll be honest, Lou,
I'm a little soused,

08:38.779 --> 08:42.652
but I think maybe you wishthat Eddie saw
youas his hero.

08:42.696 --> 08:44.567
Oh, yeah, I did,
but I know how I get.

08:44.611 --> 08:46.221
I'm probably
just overthinking it.

08:46.264 --> 08:47.352
No, no, no.

08:47.396 --> 08:49.659
If anything,
you're underthinkingit.

08:49.703 --> 08:51.835
Nicole used to think of me
as her hero,

08:51.879 --> 08:54.446
and then -- pfft --
gonzo.

08:54.490 --> 08:56.797
Was it the...uh...

08:56.840 --> 08:57.798
What?

08:57.841 --> 08:58.842
The lesbian thing?

08:58.886 --> 09:00.017
No, no. That was great.

09:00.061 --> 09:01.018
I don't know
what happened.

09:01.062 --> 09:02.629
You know, I used to
fix her car for her.

09:02.672 --> 09:05.022
I'd teach her
about classic rock.

09:05.066 --> 09:06.458
I'm a big
Pink Zeppelin fan.

09:06.502 --> 09:08.983
And then at some point,
you know, she just...

09:09.026 --> 09:11.463
stopped seeing me
as her hero.

09:11.507 --> 09:13.465
And then
she moved away and...

09:13.509 --> 09:15.380
we haven't been
as close since.
Really?

09:15.424 --> 09:17.992
Hey, if Eddie leaves the house
and you're not his hero,

09:18.035 --> 09:19.080
it's over.

09:20.298 --> 09:22.474
But Eddie only has
one year of school left.

09:22.518 --> 09:24.955
Well, then you have time
to turn things around.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.784
Hey, and if you don't,

09:27.828 --> 09:29.786
that's what whiskey is for.

09:33.921 --> 09:35.270
Great job, Ev.

09:35.313 --> 09:37.881
Ev? No, no.
His name is Ev-an.

09:37.925 --> 09:39.883
Trust me,
I named him myself.

09:39.927 --> 09:41.885
It's a new nickname
I'm trying out.

09:43.147 --> 09:45.106
Did your new friends
put you up to this?

09:45.149 --> 09:47.761
Lose it.Presidents don't have nicknames.

09:47.804 --> 09:49.023
What about Abe Lincoln?
Dead.

09:49.066 --> 09:50.241
Teddy Roosevelt?
Dead.

09:50.285 --> 09:51.678
Jimmy Carter?
Ineffective.

09:53.941 --> 09:54.681
Yes, Ev?

09:54.724 --> 09:56.726
Actually, Ev is no more.

09:56.770 --> 09:57.814
It's back to Evan now.

09:57.858 --> 09:59.686
May I please be excused
to the bathroom?

09:59.729 --> 10:00.861
Yes.

10:00.904 --> 10:04.125
Remember, sitting down to pee
doesn't make you a lesser boy.

10:09.913 --> 10:12.742
Everything okay? They said
it was a family emergency.

10:12.786 --> 10:14.222
It's our mother. Oh, God.

10:14.265 --> 10:15.789
She's ruining 8th grade
for me.

10:15.832 --> 10:17.007
That'sthe emergency?

10:17.051 --> 10:19.314
Remember how hard it was for meafter skipping a grade?

10:19.357 --> 10:22.012
I'm finally starting to fit in,and then Mommy shows up.

10:22.056 --> 10:24.449
Gentle suggestion?
Stop calling her Mommy.

10:24.493 --> 10:25.755
She won't give me
any space.

10:25.799 --> 10:26.800
She took over my locker,

10:26.843 --> 10:28.802
threw away
my "frivolous" colored pens,

10:28.845 --> 10:30.107
and you know what she said

10:30.151 --> 10:31.282
when I brought up
Geoff's Bar Mitzvah?

10:31.326 --> 10:32.893
"A boy doesn't become a man

10:32.936 --> 10:34.459
until he earns
his first paycheck.

10:34.503 --> 10:36.679
That's a
Chinese Bar Mitzvah.""...Chinese Bar Mitzvah."

10:36.723 --> 10:38.289
I went through
something similar

10:38.333 --> 10:39.943
with my friend Marta's
quinceañera.

10:39.987 --> 10:41.336
So, what should I do?

10:41.379 --> 10:42.772
Just ask Mom
to pick a new school.

10:42.816 --> 10:44.469
And interfere
with her practicum?

10:44.513 --> 10:46.689
I'm a lot of things,
but I'm not a saboteur.

10:46.733 --> 10:48.256
Then just figure out
a way to avoid her.

10:48.299 --> 10:49.257
It's a big school.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.824
Yeah, I guess.

10:50.867 --> 10:52.347
Look, I gotta go.

10:52.390 --> 10:53.957
Please don't tell Mom
we talked.

10:54.001 --> 10:55.829
I'm already too involved.

10:59.006 --> 11:00.485
The office said
to come meet you.

11:00.529 --> 11:01.573
What's going on?

11:01.617 --> 11:03.924
Is it Grandma's bookie?
We gotta move again?

11:03.967 --> 11:05.186
What? No.

11:05.229 --> 11:07.841
I just thought I'd stop by
and say hello and, uh...

11:07.884 --> 11:10.147
take you to get
Allen Iverson's autograph.

11:10.191 --> 11:11.888
For real?
You're not clowning me?

11:11.932 --> 11:13.281
Lou don't clown.

11:13.324 --> 11:15.587
Well, your mother doesn't alwayssee the whole picture.

11:15.631 --> 11:18.808
Yes, school is important,
but so is your happiness.

11:18.852 --> 11:20.767
You needed someone to swoop in
and save the day.

11:20.810 --> 11:23.378
I don't know what you would
call someone like that.

11:23.421 --> 11:25.510
I'd call them awesome.

11:26.903 --> 11:28.165
Seed planted.

11:28.209 --> 11:31.342
Well, nothing but pavement
between us and --

11:31.386 --> 11:32.953
Oh, no! Obstacle!

11:32.996 --> 11:33.736
What is it, Dad?

11:33.780 --> 11:35.651
Uh, oh, uh...car trouble.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.609
Now?
We're not gonna make it.

11:37.653 --> 11:39.873
Don't worry, son.I will get you to that signing.

11:39.916 --> 11:41.135
Your old man
knows his way around

11:41.178 --> 11:42.789
the hood area
of an automobile.

11:44.791 --> 11:47.010
Yup.
Just what I thought.

11:47.054 --> 11:50.535
A cracked flange belt...
plug.

11:50.579 --> 11:52.668
I'll have her fixed in a jiff.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.017
You sure
you don't need any help?

11:54.061 --> 11:55.627
Oh -- Oh, no.
Do not come out here.

11:55.671 --> 11:57.760
But, uh, you know
what couldhelp?

11:57.804 --> 12:00.502
Some tunes.
Hit "play" on the stereo.

this is why

12:21.262 --> 12:23.438
you should always stick
to air guitar.

12:26.049 --> 12:27.442
Oh. I was thinking
we'd buy lunch.

12:27.485 --> 12:28.617
Today is pizza day.

12:28.660 --> 12:31.402
Yes, but at home,
it's expiration date day.

12:31.446 --> 12:33.013
Quick, eat up
before they turn.

12:34.231 --> 12:36.364
Mommy,
I was thinking...

12:36.407 --> 12:38.845
instead of going to
my boring honors classes,

12:38.888 --> 12:40.585
maybe you'd be more help
with the classes

12:40.629 --> 12:42.152
with the "visual learners."

12:42.196 --> 12:43.414
Nope. Sounds bad.

12:43.458 --> 12:44.807
Hey, guys.

12:44.851 --> 12:46.896

12:46.940 --> 12:49.246

12:50.465 --> 12:51.466
...different.

12:53.729 --> 12:55.426
You sure you don't want
to switch classes?

12:55.470 --> 12:57.646
Consider it a challenge.

12:57.689 --> 12:59.822
One of the teachersdoesn't even have a lesson plan.

12:59.866 --> 13:02.172
He just makes up facts
and plays the guitar.

13:02.216 --> 13:04.827
Tempting, but I already
lined up our schedules

13:04.871 --> 13:06.611
and turned in my timecard
to Principal Hunter.

13:06.655 --> 13:07.961
We're set.

13:08.004 --> 13:10.920
If it were up to me, we'd be
in school together forever.

13:10.964 --> 13:12.922
Forever.

13:12.966 --> 13:14.881
Jessica: Go, go, go!

13:14.924 --> 13:17.231
You call that rowing?!
I call it pathetic!

13:17.274 --> 13:19.450
No wonder
you're all still virgins!

13:19.494 --> 13:22.540
Sweetie,
how are your boom booms?

13:24.891 --> 13:26.631
This is too cold.

13:26.675 --> 13:28.895
I'm gonna go sweet-talk
that hairy lunch lady

13:28.938 --> 13:30.331
into using the microwave.

13:30.374 --> 13:32.724
And a hair net.

13:32.768 --> 13:36.119
I must get rid of Mommy.

I thought you said
you knew what you were doing.

13:56.052 --> 13:57.271
Yeah, yeah.
I got it.

13:57.314 --> 13:59.447
See?

13:59.490 --> 14:00.535
Uh...that --

14:00.578 --> 14:01.710
Oh!

14:01.753 --> 14:04.147
Why are there so many things
in here?!

14:04.191 --> 14:06.149
Alright, I don'tknow
what I'm doing.

14:06.193 --> 14:07.977
I was pretending
the car broke down,

14:08.021 --> 14:09.152
and then I broke it
for real.

14:09.196 --> 14:11.328
What?
Why would you do that?

14:11.372 --> 14:12.286
I don't know.

14:12.329 --> 14:13.940
So you would see me
as your hero.

14:13.983 --> 14:15.680
By playing mechanic?

14:15.724 --> 14:18.118
Well, now I don't
get to meet Allen Iverson.

14:18.161 --> 14:19.293
Some hero you are.

14:22.383 --> 14:23.906
Aah! Oh, no! Again!

14:27.954 --> 14:29.956
Hunter, your microwave
destroyed my spoon.

14:29.999 --> 14:31.174
You owe me a spoon.

14:31.218 --> 14:32.088
Evan?!

14:33.002 --> 14:34.569
Is that my timecard?

14:34.612 --> 14:37.180
I was just checking
your math.

14:37.224 --> 14:38.747
Uh, 10, carry the 1...

14:38.790 --> 14:39.922
Oh.
Yep, looks good.

14:39.966 --> 14:43.926
We both know my math
doesn't need to be checked.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.580
Youneed to be checked.

14:46.581 --> 14:48.626
Sneaking into
Principal Hunter's office?

14:48.670 --> 14:51.107
Did your new sketchy friends
put you up to this?

14:51.151 --> 14:52.935
They didn't make me.
Youdid!

14:52.979 --> 14:55.807
I was padding your hoursto get you out of school faster.

14:55.851 --> 14:56.896
I don't want you here!

15:00.725 --> 15:02.989
You don't want me here?No.
You're messing up my life.

15:03.032 --> 15:05.774
Me?! You're the one
who's getting detention

15:05.817 --> 15:07.558
and breaking
into offices.

15:07.602 --> 15:09.212
This is so unlike you,
Evan.

15:09.256 --> 15:11.345
Very unpresidential.

15:11.388 --> 15:12.346
Well, except for Nixon.

15:12.389 --> 15:14.043
But at least
he had the good sense

15:14.087 --> 15:15.218
to pay other people
to do it!

15:15.262 --> 15:17.568
We all got detention,
but we weren't late.

15:17.612 --> 15:19.353
Mr. Marsh is a hardliner
from Arizona

15:19.396 --> 15:21.355
who doesn't believe
in Daylight Savings.

15:21.398 --> 15:24.010
You're still
veering off course.

15:24.053 --> 15:27.578
That's why I'm here --
to get you back on track.

15:27.622 --> 15:30.103
I mean, puka shells,
magic tricks,

15:30.146 --> 15:31.800
Geoff with a "G"?

15:31.843 --> 15:33.236
Well, you're a jerk
with a "J"!

15:34.716 --> 15:37.414
If you really think these puka
shells are the problem, here.

15:38.546 --> 15:40.896
I dare you to not try this on
when you're alone.

15:48.860 --> 15:49.992
Hey. Good news.

15:50.036 --> 15:51.559
Marvin said
he could fix the van.

15:51.602 --> 15:54.040
Turns out the problem was
I jammed a screwdriver in it.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.345
Looks like
you saved the day again.

15:55.389 --> 15:56.781
Good job, hero.

15:56.825 --> 15:58.348
Sorry.

15:58.392 --> 16:00.437
It's just that
when you chose Allen Iverson

16:00.481 --> 16:02.657
for your essay instead of me,
I freaked out.

16:02.700 --> 16:05.268
And then
Marvin got in my head,

16:05.312 --> 16:08.576
and with you going off
to college so soon...

16:08.619 --> 16:10.404
I just don't want us
to grow apart.

16:11.448 --> 16:13.233
This is ridiculous.

16:13.276 --> 16:14.451
I know. I'm sorry.

16:14.495 --> 16:16.627
No, I mean, I can't believe
you'd ever think that.

16:17.541 --> 16:19.021
You've always been there
for me.

16:19.065 --> 16:21.154
You taught me how to drive,
gave me my first job,

16:21.197 --> 16:22.677
helped me
with my girl problems --

16:22.720 --> 16:24.809
I mean, womenproblems.

16:24.853 --> 16:25.810
Good catch.

16:25.854 --> 16:27.638
You have nothing
to worry about.

16:27.682 --> 16:30.815
Sure, A.I. is awesome,
but you're more than a hero.

16:30.859 --> 16:32.904
You're my dad.

16:32.948 --> 16:34.036
I'm always
going to need you,

16:34.080 --> 16:36.169
and we're never
going to grow apart.

16:37.779 --> 16:39.607
You want a hug, don't you?

16:39.650 --> 16:42.262
Whatever.
I could go either way.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.093
Hey.
I have an idea.

16:47.136 --> 16:49.356
Quick, grab your Iversqn.
Let's go.

16:52.315 --> 16:55.188
Three more minutes on your test,then pencils down.

16:57.494 --> 16:59.105
What's wrong with Evan?

17:00.584 --> 17:02.282
Excuse me, ma'am.
Who are you?

17:02.325 --> 17:03.631
A concerned parent.

17:03.674 --> 17:06.895
God, I miss the WASPy coldness
of private school parents.

17:06.938 --> 17:08.418
I don't get it.

17:08.462 --> 17:10.072
Evan's not himself
anymore.

17:10.116 --> 17:13.075
He's ruining his dreams
of becoming Doctor-President.

17:13.119 --> 17:14.468
No, he's not.

17:14.511 --> 17:17.166
Last night, he held a model U.N.with his Beanie Babies.

17:17.210 --> 17:19.299
They executed Oinker
for war crimes.

17:19.342 --> 17:21.083
But was he wearing
his puka shells?

17:21.127 --> 17:23.172
Evan's just getting older
and trying new things.

17:23.216 --> 17:24.739
That doesn't make him
a different person.

17:24.782 --> 17:27.133
But I don't recognize him
anymore.

17:27.176 --> 17:29.178
Every day,
it's something new.

17:29.222 --> 17:30.527
Mom, 8th grade's tough.

17:30.571 --> 17:32.486
It's that awkward time
before high school.

17:32.529 --> 17:34.357
Remember when I got that zit
on my lip

17:34.401 --> 17:36.229
and no one spoke to me
for a week --

17:36.272 --> 17:37.969
at school orat home?

17:38.013 --> 17:39.493
Oh, I popped it
in your sleep,

17:39.536 --> 17:42.104
but by morning,
it had grown back stronger...

17:42.148 --> 17:43.192
and angrier.

17:43.236 --> 17:45.542
Evan's just trying
to figure it all out.

17:45.586 --> 17:47.370
If you really want to help him,give him space.

17:48.632 --> 17:50.286
It's not easy having your mom
at school with you.

17:51.287 --> 17:53.898
Time.
Hand your tests forward.

17:54.986 --> 17:58.207
"C," "D,"
not enough information, "A"...

17:59.991 --> 18:02.951
Good news, bad news,
good news, bad news.

18:02.994 --> 18:04.605
Good news,
I got past security

18:04.648 --> 18:06.607
with a classic
Louis Huang fakeout.

18:09.392 --> 18:11.351
Shark!

18:16.399 --> 18:17.966
I fell for that, too.

18:18.009 --> 18:20.055
An escaped shark?
That's not what you want.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.535
Okay, bad news --

18:21.578 --> 18:23.841
Allen Iverson wouldn't sign
your fake jersey.

18:23.885 --> 18:26.366
Agh. Iversqn.
That damn "Q."

18:26.409 --> 18:28.368
Good news --
I told him he's your hero,

18:28.411 --> 18:29.586
and he signed this instead.

18:29.630 --> 18:32.154
This is a real jersey.

18:32.198 --> 18:33.199
And it's game-worn.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.376
It reeks.

18:36.419 --> 18:37.377
Like 46 points.

18:37.420 --> 18:38.813
Thanks, Dad.

18:38.856 --> 18:40.771
Oop. Last bad news.

18:40.815 --> 18:43.209
I have a lifetime ban
from all NBA events.

18:43.252 --> 18:44.732
Sorry, son.

18:44.775 --> 18:46.386
I gotta remove him
from the property.

18:46.429 --> 18:49.171
But I must say,
you got a pretty cool dad.

18:49.215 --> 18:50.999
The best.

18:52.479 --> 18:54.220
Just so you know,
I knew there wasn't a shark.

18:54.263 --> 18:57.745
But, you know...
safety first.

19:20.942 --> 19:22.900
A little bit.
Like just barely.

19:22.944 --> 19:24.250
Barely?

We're always
on the same page.

19:30.473 --> 19:33.389
I'm used to you
telling me everything --

what you're thinking,
how your day went,

19:36.523 --> 19:38.655
what Grandma writes about me
in her journal.

19:38.699 --> 19:40.266
I didn't tell you
about the necklace

19:40.309 --> 19:41.571
because I knew
you'd hate it.

19:41.615 --> 19:43.834
You hate a lot of stuff.I do.

19:43.878 --> 19:45.706
I just want to be able
to try things on my own.

19:45.749 --> 19:47.098
I know.

19:47.142 --> 19:50.058
You have to find out foryourself that things are stupid.

19:50.101 --> 19:52.321
And you wonder
why I don't tell you things.

19:53.279 --> 19:55.672
I'm sorry
I called you the J-word.

20:03.419 --> 20:07.336
But if you ever need the truth,you know where to find me.

20:07.380 --> 20:08.337
Deal?

20:08.381 --> 20:09.643
Deal.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.689
I shouldn't have changed
your timecard.

20:12.733 --> 20:14.082
That was a low moment.

20:14.125 --> 20:15.953
It was, but good news --

20:15.997 --> 20:18.347
no more timecards,
no more practicum.

20:18.391 --> 20:19.261
What?

20:19.305 --> 20:20.915
Emery's cranky teacher
told me

20:20.958 --> 20:23.526
private schools don't require
any of that nonsense.

20:23.570 --> 20:25.659
I could become a teacher boss
right away!

20:30.664 --> 20:33.188

It's a unisex fragrance.

20:33.232 --> 20:36.147
