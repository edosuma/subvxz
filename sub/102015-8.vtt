WEBVTT

00:27.444 --> 00:29.655
I taste a liquor never brewed -

00:36.286 --> 00:38.789
From Tankards scooped in Pearl -

00:55.848 --> 00:58.475
Not Frankfort Berries
Yield the sense

01:26.253 --> 01:28.255
Such a delirious whirl.

01:46.190 --> 01:47.191
Immortality.

01:49.234 --> 01:50.235
Holy shit.

01:55.115 --> 01:58.535
"Inebriate of air – am I –
And Debauchee of Dew –

01:58.952 --> 02:03.123
Reeling – thro' endless summer days –
From inns of molten Blue –

02:03.207 --> 02:07.544
When 'Landlords' turn the drunken Bee
Out of the Foxglove's door –

02:07.628 --> 02:10.214
When Butterflies –
Renounce their 'drams' –

02:10.297 --> 02:12.216
I shall but drink the more!"

02:13.509 --> 02:14.510
Okay, slay.

02:14.593 --> 02:16.595
Indeed. That slaps.

02:16.678 --> 02:19.014
Like, literally, I feel seen.

02:19.097 --> 02:21.308
It is a very nice poem. Who wrote it?

02:21.808 --> 02:22.935
Emily wrote it, Mom.

02:23.352 --> 02:24.645
Who did?

02:24.728 --> 02:26.396
Emily Dickinson, your daughter,

02:26.480 --> 02:30.692
wrote this poem which is on the front page
of today's Springfield Republican.

02:30.776 --> 02:32.110
And it's about getting wasted.

02:33.237 --> 02:35.656
It is not about getting wasted, Ship.

02:35.739 --> 02:39.034
"I taste a liquor never brewed."
I mean, come on!

02:39.117 --> 02:42.287
It's about the heady intoxication
of nature itself,

02:42.371 --> 02:44.540
a glory which no alcohol
could ever provide.

02:44.623 --> 02:46.458
So, it's precisely
not about getting drunk,

02:46.542 --> 02:48.544
except from the high of a sublime emotion.

02:48.627 --> 02:49.628
Okay.

02:50.254 --> 02:51.463
You read too much.

02:51.547 --> 02:53.090
Sorry I enjoy challenging myself.

02:53.173 --> 02:56.593
You are gonna have to accept
me for who I am...

02:56.677 --> 02:58.053
-No, Ship.
-...Lavinia.

02:58.136 --> 02:59.972
We have to accept each other!

03:00.055 --> 03:01.849
-No!
-I don't understand.

03:01.932 --> 03:04.059
A poem by Emily. How did this happen?

03:04.142 --> 03:05.561
Is this some kind of accident?

03:05.644 --> 03:07.145
Did Austin enter another contest?

03:07.229 --> 03:09.982
You're telling me that
everyone in this town has a copy of this?

03:10.065 --> 03:11.233
Not just everyone in town.

03:11.316 --> 03:14.027
The Springfield Republican
has over 12,000 subscribers.

03:14.778 --> 03:15.821
Oh, my God.

03:15.904 --> 03:18.407
This is so crazy. Emily is famous.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.618
The Lord help us
when your father claps his eyes on that.

03:21.702 --> 03:25.122
Well, thank you for asking,
but no breakfast for me today.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.749
I couldn't possibly eat.
I am much too excited.

03:28.083 --> 03:30.252
A lifelong dream is coming true.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.921
You see, this poem
was a passion project for me.

03:33.005 --> 03:34.423
Years in the making.

03:38.552 --> 03:39.636
I've got a busy schedule today,

03:39.720 --> 03:42.472
but I do have a few minutes
if anybody wants to ask me anything.

03:43.807 --> 03:48.687
I'm happy to speak on my themes, my meter,
give you a little window into my process.

03:50.814 --> 03:51.982
Anybody?

03:52.065 --> 03:53.066
Where is Emily?

03:53.150 --> 03:54.318
I guess she's still asleep.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.236
-I'm right here.
-Asleep? No.

03:57.029 --> 03:59.031
I am sure she's hiding herself
in that bedroom,

03:59.114 --> 04:00.490
which is what I would do if I were her.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.117
What is wrong with you guys? Hello?

04:02.201 --> 04:05.579
Because Lord knows what's in store for her
when her father sees this.

04:05.662 --> 04:06.663
Father sees what?

04:08.290 --> 04:09.291
What?

04:10.042 --> 04:11.043
What are you hiding there?

04:12.044 --> 04:13.253
How about some breakfast, dear?

04:14.046 --> 04:16.882
Maybe some tea? Some relaxing tea.

04:16.964 --> 04:18.591
I don't need to relax. I just woke up.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.636
Why are you hiding my paper
behind your back?

04:20.719 --> 04:22.387
Give it here, woman. Give it here.

04:22.471 --> 04:23.388
Please.

04:24.556 --> 04:25.974
See, it's not so bad.

04:26.892 --> 04:29.728
I was afraid you're going to tell me
there was another stock market crash.

04:29.811 --> 04:32.648
I wrote a poem and it got published, and
now it's on the front page of the paper.

04:32.731 --> 04:33.607
Deal with it!

04:34.775 --> 04:36.944
Oh, look, there's a sale on lace curtains.

04:37.027 --> 04:39.446
Is there? I didn't see that
when I was looking at the paper.

04:39.530 --> 04:40.948
-Don't get too excited, Mrs. Dickinson.
-Let me see.

04:41.031 --> 04:42.824
It says, "lower than usual prices." Lower.

04:42.908 --> 04:45.410
-Curtains?
-Our curtains are just fine. Look at them.

04:45.494 --> 04:47.120
I'll just take the paper
in the other room.

04:47.204 --> 04:49.456
Give me the paper back, please?

04:50.457 --> 04:53.752
"'The May-Wine' by E. Dickinson"?

04:53.836 --> 04:55.963
So this is what
you were trying to keep from me.

04:56.046 --> 04:57.172
She's gone and done it.

04:57.256 --> 05:00.342
Does anybody wanna talk to me about this?

05:00.425 --> 05:01.677
There's no stopping her now.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.595
I'm so sorry, Edward. This is my fault.

05:03.679 --> 05:05.639
I should've kept closer watch on her.

05:05.722 --> 05:08.183
You know what? It's not too bad.

05:10.185 --> 05:12.312
"Landlords of the drunken Bee
Turn the drunk"--

05:12.396 --> 05:15.399
Okay, you guys don't need
to act like I don't exist. Hello?

05:15.482 --> 05:17.484
She might make
this family proud after all.

05:17.568 --> 05:19.027
Oh, my God, am I invisible?

05:33.166 --> 05:36.753
So no one can see me,
no one can hear me, no one can feel me.

05:36.837 --> 05:37.838
Maggie!

05:40.257 --> 05:41.383
You can see me.

05:41.466 --> 05:43.343
I forgot to beat the rugs today.

05:46.471 --> 05:47.472
Come on!

05:48.724 --> 05:51.518
Ship, hi! Hello. Can you see me?

05:51.602 --> 05:53.228
Vinnie, I can't do this anymore.

05:53.604 --> 05:56.356
I am an ambitious
entrepreneurial businessman,

05:56.440 --> 05:58.317
and I need a wife who supports me.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.401
Ship, I can hear you.

05:59.484 --> 06:03.322
I thought you were that wife,
but what I have learned is, you're not,

06:03.739 --> 06:07.367
even though you're superhot
and I love your pussy.

06:07.451 --> 06:08.952
You're talking about her--
He's talking about her cat.

06:09.036 --> 06:12.039
I'm just gonna have to
be a man about this and call it off.

06:13.165 --> 06:16.001
I am leaving you, Lavinia.

06:18.921 --> 06:22.007
Ship, we can all hear you in there
talking to yourself.

06:22.090 --> 06:24.384
-I wasn't just talking to myself.
-No, because I'm here.

06:24.468 --> 06:26.136
I was breaking up with you, Lavinia.

06:26.220 --> 06:29.556
Okay, well, too late,
because I am breaking up with you.

06:29.640 --> 06:31.183
-What?
-I can't do this anymore.

06:31.266 --> 06:32.392
The engagement is off.

06:32.476 --> 06:33.435
-You guys.
-Yeah, sure.

06:33.519 --> 06:37.272
I'll just set my clock to 26 hours from
now, and you'll change your mind again.

06:37.356 --> 06:38.982
A day has 24 hours, Ship.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.860
Look, I'm sorry
that I didn't graduate from college.

06:41.944 --> 06:43.237
I guess I'll never be good enough for you.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.781
-I'm literally standing...
-You are so insecure, it's exhausting!

06:45.864 --> 06:47.533
-You intimidate me.
-What?

06:47.616 --> 06:49.701
You have all these modern ideas,

06:49.785 --> 06:54.039
and I just want you to be
my traditional, normal wife.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.290
Whoa.

06:55.374 --> 06:58.502
Okay. Well, I'm not normal.

06:58.585 --> 06:59.753
Okay?

06:59.837 --> 07:04.675
I am a twisted, witchy,
creative, horny woman,

07:04.758 --> 07:06.426
and you can't accept that.

07:06.510 --> 07:07.761
You can't accept me!

07:07.845 --> 07:08.846
What is happening?

07:11.515 --> 07:13.267
The vibes in this place are off.

07:13.350 --> 07:14.852
I think it's still haunted
from the séance.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.562
Emily literally saw a ghost.

07:16.645 --> 07:19.189
Oh, my God. Am I a ghost?

07:19.273 --> 07:22.067
You Dickinsons, you're all insane.

07:23.068 --> 07:26.321
I'd be better off in Nevada,
getting horsewhipped by Lola

07:26.405 --> 07:30.242
and losing my mind
as she performs her erotic spider dance!

07:32.619 --> 07:34.121
The spider dance.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.540
Lavinia, please acknowledge my presence!

07:39.751 --> 07:42.629
One, two, three, four, five...

07:42.713 --> 07:44.506
-Or not. I mean...
-six, seven, eight.

07:44.590 --> 07:46.884
One, two, three, four...

07:46.967 --> 07:49.136
-Vinnie, don't hurt yourself, now.
-...five, six, seven, eight.

07:49.219 --> 07:50.596
One, two, three.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.935
Lavinia? Vinnie?

07:57.477 --> 07:58.645
Vinnie!

07:58.729 --> 07:59.813
I tried to warn you.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.150
What the hell is going on?

08:03.233 --> 08:04.401
You didn't listen to me.

08:04.776 --> 08:06.862
Who are you
and what are you doing in my kitchen?

08:06.945 --> 08:08.322
I'm Nobody! Who are you?

08:08.405 --> 08:11.575
Okay, this riddle is cute,
but you're a ghost

08:11.658 --> 08:14.161
and you're the only one who can see me,
which means I'm dead!

08:14.828 --> 08:17.039
I died in the night, maybe.

08:18.248 --> 08:21.460
Okay. That's cool.
All right, I'm cool with that.

08:21.543 --> 08:23.128
It was painless, I guess.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.715
I wonder when my family will find my body.

08:27.382 --> 08:28.842
Maybe they're upstairs right now,

08:28.926 --> 08:31.762
about to pull back the covers
to reveal my frozen corpse!

08:36.390 --> 08:38.769
You're not dead and I'm not a ghost.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.063
Really? 'Cause you sure act like one.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.982
Appearing out of nowhere, haunting me!

08:44.066 --> 08:46.401
I'm not a ghost. I'm just a mystery.

08:46.818 --> 08:47.861
A mystery?

08:48.278 --> 08:49.488
Wow. Okay.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.615
And I'm supposed to solve you?

08:52.032 --> 08:53.033
You can try.

08:53.116 --> 08:55.285
Look, as enticing as you're making this,
I think I'll pass.

08:55.369 --> 08:57.329
Kinda have my hands full right now.

08:57.412 --> 08:59.331
It is the biggest day of my life,

08:59.414 --> 09:02.835
and I was expecting some,
I don't know, appreciation.

09:03.418 --> 09:04.837
Maybe a compliment or two.

09:04.920 --> 09:07.297
But here I am, literally invisible

09:07.381 --> 09:10.384
on the one day when I'm supposed to be
the center of attention.

09:10.467 --> 09:12.261
Maybe there's an upside to your situation.

09:12.344 --> 09:13.512
What do you mean, "upside"?

09:13.595 --> 09:16.515
Well, you're invisible,
which means you can find out the truth.

09:17.349 --> 09:18.350
The truth?

09:18.433 --> 09:21.061
You can find out
what people actually think of your poem.

09:28.527 --> 09:29.570
That's good.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.115
Springfield Republican.

09:33.574 --> 09:35.450
Come on up and get your paper!

09:38.120 --> 09:39.496
Springfield Republican.

09:40.497 --> 09:44.209
Come and get the latest scoop!
Springfield Republican!

09:45.043 --> 09:46.837
Thank you so much. Yes, thank you.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.256
That is my poem right there,
on the front page of the paper,

09:49.339 --> 09:51.717
written by me, Emily Dickinson.

09:52.092 --> 09:55.345
Thank you for supporting the written word.
Thank you. Wow, look at that.

09:55.804 --> 09:57.723
Check out this poem. Did you read it?

09:57.806 --> 10:01.101
Yeah, I read it.
It's by a woman. She must be bold.

10:01.185 --> 10:02.853
I think it's really good.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.272
Yeah, you can tell she's really smart.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.983
-Thank you.
-And really lascivious.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.611
-Yeah, she wants it bad.
-Wait, what?

10:10.694 --> 10:12.571
She lives in this town. We can find her.

10:12.654 --> 10:15.115
-No, that's okay.
-Yes. Let's go to her house.

10:15.199 --> 10:18.410
Let's go to her house,
and let's jack off in the bushes.

10:18.493 --> 10:20.287
I'm gonna jack off right on this poem.

10:22.623 --> 10:23.790
Fame can be ugly.

10:33.091 --> 10:35.928
I am honestly so happy for her. I am.

10:36.011 --> 10:37.513
Yeah, I really like this poem.

10:37.596 --> 10:40.015
Thank you! Thank you.
That is so nice to hear.

10:40.349 --> 10:41.558
I thought it was stupid.

10:42.184 --> 10:44.937
First of all, it rhymes,
which I find juvenile.

10:45.020 --> 10:47.523
Well, okay, yeah. That's true, but--

10:47.606 --> 10:49.608
I mean, come on. Rhyme?

10:50.359 --> 10:53.320
I thought we moved on from that.
Aren't we all doing free verse now?

10:53.403 --> 10:56.448
Well, I think you have to master
the rules first before you break them.

10:56.532 --> 10:58.200
Well, she hasn't mastered anything.

10:58.283 --> 11:01.119
I could've written this in my sleep,
and it's putting me to sleep.

11:01.203 --> 11:02.829
So boring.

11:02.913 --> 11:04.957
Well, I actually don't find it boring...

11:05.040 --> 11:06.416
That's my girl.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.168
...as much as I find it offensive.

11:08.752 --> 11:09.962
Offensive? Why?

11:10.045 --> 11:12.089
I mean, it's not even
saying anything offensive.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.800
That's what makes it so offensive.
It's like, have an edge.

11:14.883 --> 11:17.135
Be political or else
you're just wasting our time.

11:18.136 --> 11:20.347
Yeah, you know what? You convinced me.

11:20.430 --> 11:24.059
This poem is dumb, and I am not impressed.

11:24.142 --> 11:26.520
Okay. I love this discussion, but--

11:26.603 --> 11:28.063
Let's move on with our lives.

11:29.314 --> 11:30.315
Hattie.

11:32.401 --> 11:34.528
-What was that?
-Another taste of fame.

11:34.611 --> 11:36.613
So, she did the damn thing.

11:36.697 --> 11:37.948
Yup, Emily's published.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.950
This is the worst day of my life.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.201
Honestly, I love it.

11:41.285 --> 11:44.204
-It's, like, so relevant to now.
-So true.

11:44.288 --> 11:47.499
I love it too. I mean, I don't get it.
That's why I love it.

11:47.583 --> 11:49.418
It's so deep.

11:49.501 --> 11:51.170
It's about alcohol.

11:51.253 --> 11:53.797
I heard the Temperance Society is pissed.

11:53.881 --> 11:56.300
People are gonna be writing letters.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.551
She's gonna need protection.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.303
She'll be fine.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.265
Hey, don't you want this?

12:07.102 --> 12:08.520
Here today, gone tomorrow.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.992
So, not what you expected
being famous to feel like.

12:23.202 --> 12:27.289
I don't know what I expected,
but this, this is worse.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.583
Come on. It's not so bad.

12:31.210 --> 12:33.212
Everybody just gets to talk about me

12:33.295 --> 12:35.756
regardless of whether or not
what they say is true?

12:35.839 --> 12:38.342
Guess you don't know
what it'll feel like till it happens.

12:39.218 --> 12:41.428
Fame... it's kinda like death.

12:42.763 --> 12:44.223
But I'm not dead, am I?

12:44.306 --> 12:45.807
No. You're just...

12:46.350 --> 12:47.476
Invisible.

12:49.645 --> 12:51.480
Many wonderful things
are invisible, you know.

12:51.563 --> 12:52.564
What do you mean?

12:52.648 --> 12:53.815
The air we breathe.

12:54.566 --> 12:56.610
The breeze that blows. Love.

13:00.572 --> 13:01.782
I see what you're saying.

13:02.199 --> 13:04.785
The world runs on invisible things,
Emily Dickinson.

13:07.746 --> 13:08.747
You know...

13:10.457 --> 13:11.458
you're right.

13:13.836 --> 13:16.630
I'm like a beautiful perfume.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.507
The notes of a song.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.801
That feeling that you get
at the end of summer.

13:20.884 --> 13:22.052
Being invisible...

13:23.679 --> 13:24.888
it's power.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.692
My friend Ben is buried here.

13:36.775 --> 13:38.110
You miss him.

13:38.193 --> 13:39.987
Yeah. I do.

13:40.070 --> 13:43.782
But when I'm standing here,
it's like he's just invisible.

13:45.450 --> 13:46.994
What does your gravestone say?

13:47.703 --> 13:49.329
I don't have a gravestone.

13:51.206 --> 13:53.417
But you have a name.

13:54.084 --> 13:55.419
-Do I?
-You must.

13:56.211 --> 13:58.630
I recognize you from somewhere.
I know you.

13:59.590 --> 14:01.842
I mean, deep down,
you must know who you are.

14:02.217 --> 14:03.218
Can't remember.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.345
Why not?

14:06.972 --> 14:08.307
I forgot everything except...

14:10.642 --> 14:11.643
Except?

14:12.394 --> 14:13.604
Well, there's a flash...

14:16.607 --> 14:17.608
blinding pain.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.903
There's a great, terrible battle,

14:20.986 --> 14:22.613
men everywhere, young men...

14:24.323 --> 14:25.324
screaming.

14:25.407 --> 14:28.535
And the smell,
the overwhelming smell of metal.

14:31.288 --> 14:32.331
And an explosion...

14:36.877 --> 14:37.878
hitting me.

14:38.629 --> 14:40.714
And warming me and freezing me and then...

14:44.176 --> 14:45.177
nothing.

15:22.297 --> 15:25.133
I've received word from down south
and it's good.

15:25.217 --> 15:26.426
-Yes!
-Yeah.

15:26.510 --> 15:28.720
The money we've secured
from our paper sales

15:28.804 --> 15:31.139
has reached John Brown and his camp.

15:31.598 --> 15:34.351
-Yes!
-His men feel optimistic.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.353
They have everything they need,

15:36.436 --> 15:38.981
thanks to us and others like us.

15:39.064 --> 15:40.816
Whoo! Yes!

15:42.150 --> 15:44.778
Soon enough,
they will carry out their plan.

15:44.862 --> 15:46.488
They will attack...

15:46.572 --> 15:50.826
and American reality itself
will be transformed.

15:51.285 --> 15:54.872
Revolution is coming.

15:54.955 --> 15:56.290
It's coming! It's coming!

15:56.373 --> 15:59.710
And The Constellation is a part of that.

16:00.169 --> 16:05.883
Our money may have bought their weapons,
but our words have given them strength.

16:05.966 --> 16:07.009
Yes!

16:10.762 --> 16:13.390
Not everyone's words. Hattie.

16:13.849 --> 16:16.518
If you have something to say to me,
you can say it to my face.

16:16.602 --> 16:19.563
I'm just saying. Your little
ghost stories aren't liberating anyone.

16:19.646 --> 16:23.567
My little "ghost stories" have subtext.

16:23.650 --> 16:27.654
I use the Gothic genre to ask critical
questions about women's experiences,

16:27.738 --> 16:29.281
and at least I'm not out here

16:29.364 --> 16:33.785
selling the same old minor
personal anecdote for the past ten years!

16:33.869 --> 16:35.078
I escaped in a box.

16:35.162 --> 16:36.622
You're literally a street magician.

16:36.705 --> 16:38.290
Wow.

16:38.373 --> 16:41.710
You're addicted to telling people
you escaped in a box.

16:41.793 --> 16:43.921
We get it. Everyone gets it.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.548
I'm spreading the word
about the perils of slavery.

16:46.632 --> 16:47.799
You're spreading the word so much,

16:47.883 --> 16:50.010
it stopped being a way
for people to escape.

16:50.093 --> 16:51.053
Hey, enough!

16:51.136 --> 16:52.429
That's true.

16:52.513 --> 16:54.431
This pettiness here has to stop.

16:54.890 --> 16:57.309
We have to rise above.

16:57.392 --> 16:59.937
The work that we're doing
is not about the ego.

17:00.020 --> 17:02.606
It's not about
who gets the most attention,

17:03.023 --> 17:05.317
who gets the most money,
who gets to be on the front page.

17:05.400 --> 17:08.153
That is not what we are fighting for.

17:08.694 --> 17:09.988
-Is it?
-No.

17:10.071 --> 17:11.490
-Is it?
-No.

17:11.573 --> 17:12.491
No.

17:13.242 --> 17:16.453
What we are doing here
is far more important than any of that.

17:16.537 --> 17:21.791
What we are doing here
is claiming our right to exist.

17:21.875 --> 17:22.876
Yes.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.419
Our writing?

17:24.502 --> 17:27.172
Our newspaper is changing the world.

17:27.673 --> 17:31.093
It's changing
the entire fate of this country.

17:31.510 --> 17:37.683
And though we may be anonymous today,
tomorrow we will not be invisible.

17:37.766 --> 17:39.518
-All right.
-Yep. Yep.

17:39.601 --> 17:41.478
-Will you be invisible?
-No.

17:41.812 --> 17:43.856
-Will you be invisible?
-No.

17:46.817 --> 17:47.985
Will you?

17:48.652 --> 17:52.030
-Yes, will you be invisible?
-No.

17:52.114 --> 17:53.031
That's right.

17:53.115 --> 17:54.241
Henry's right.

17:55.325 --> 17:58.620
We need to celebrate... not bicker.

18:00.163 --> 18:01.164
Amen.

18:01.582 --> 18:02.875
Okay. Right on.

18:02.958 --> 18:05.210
Our subscribers are through the roof.

18:05.294 --> 18:10.549
We are funding a revolution
of the mind, the body, the spirit.

18:10.632 --> 18:13.302
Future generations
will know a world better than this one

18:13.385 --> 18:15.095
because we are rising up.

18:15.179 --> 18:17.181
We are taking control.

18:17.264 --> 18:19.183
Yes! Yes.

18:20.893 --> 18:24.855
And I don't know about you all but...

18:27.524 --> 18:28.734
I wanna dance.

18:31.945 --> 18:34.698
Damn. You stole that?

18:35.115 --> 18:36.116
Let me look hot.

18:36.533 --> 18:37.951
I brought my fiddle.

18:38.035 --> 18:39.453
Hell yeah.

18:39.536 --> 18:41.663
Freddie's back on his bullshit.

20:05.247 --> 20:06.331
Pick up the pace.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.127
I'm sure Emily will be here soon.

20:11.044 --> 20:12.087
Whatever.

20:13.297 --> 20:14.423
God, where could she be?

20:14.506 --> 20:18.468
This is the big night we've all been
waiting for and she just... disappears.

20:22.014 --> 20:22.931
Austin.

20:26.935 --> 20:28.103
Have you seen Emily?

20:28.687 --> 20:29.813
Not today.

20:30.981 --> 20:33.275
Raided the kitchen.
There's not much in there.

20:35.152 --> 20:36.695
Where's the belle of the ball?

20:36.778 --> 20:39.156
Look, everyone. Mr. Bowles has arrived.

20:39.239 --> 20:40.240
Sorry I'm late.

20:40.699 --> 20:42.034
So where is she?

20:42.451 --> 20:45.120
-Emily? She's been missing all day.
-Yep.

20:46.246 --> 20:48.874
Missing? On today of all days?

20:49.666 --> 20:52.878
Why, I thought she'd be swanning around,
soaking up all the wild applause.

20:57.549 --> 20:59.384
Hey. How you doing, man?

20:59.927 --> 21:02.137
That's a nice copy.
You get it commissioned?

21:02.763 --> 21:05.182
Copy? What do you mean?

21:05.265 --> 21:07.809
I mean,
it's an excellent replica of the original.

21:07.893 --> 21:09.520
This is the original.

21:10.354 --> 21:11.980
It's by a European master.

21:12.064 --> 21:13.774
No. No, it's not.

21:13.857 --> 21:15.359
See, I know the guy who did this.

21:15.943 --> 21:17.569
Yeah, the grass is the tell.

21:18.153 --> 21:20.614
The strokes, they're not delicate enough.

21:21.782 --> 21:23.992
I paid so much money for this.

21:24.910 --> 21:27.079
What in the world are you talking about?

21:29.248 --> 21:30.499
The painting.

21:31.124 --> 21:32.251
It's a reproduction.

21:32.334 --> 21:34.169
They told me this was the original.

21:37.923 --> 21:43.136
Well, who cares if it's real
as long as it looks good, right?

21:46.765 --> 21:48.642
-Excuse me.
-Austin, you can't leave.

21:48.725 --> 21:50.519
-I have to clear my head.
-We have guests.

21:50.602 --> 21:53.981
Well, we don't have Emily,
and this party is supposed to be for her,

21:54.773 --> 21:55.899
so I'll go find her.

23:59.815 --> 24:00.816
Emily!

24:16.665 --> 24:18.709
What are you doing here? Come on.

24:20.210 --> 24:22.796
Wow, Austin. You can see me?

24:22.880 --> 24:24.006
Are you drunk?

24:24.631 --> 24:26.383
I don't know. Are you drunk?

24:27.759 --> 24:29.344
Why didn't you come to our house?

24:29.428 --> 24:33.557
Because no one can see me anyway, Austin.
I'm invisible.

24:33.974 --> 24:35.976
Okay, clearly, I can see you.

24:36.685 --> 24:39.438
Well, you're the first person
who's been able to see me all day.

24:39.521 --> 24:42.900
Is this some weird psychological
reaction to getting published?

24:44.234 --> 24:45.903
I'm nobody, Austin.

24:48.405 --> 24:49.823
You're somebody to me.

24:49.907 --> 24:51.658
Is that dude really talking to himself?

24:51.742 --> 24:52.868
Yeah, it's my boss.

24:52.951 --> 24:54.077
What's his deal?

24:54.578 --> 24:57.039
You don't even know
how many white secrets I'm keeping.

24:58.165 --> 24:59.458
Did you read my poem?

24:59.541 --> 25:00.542
Of course.

25:01.460 --> 25:02.920
I'm so proud of you.

25:03.253 --> 25:04.254
You are?

25:04.338 --> 25:06.089
Yeah. Honestly.

25:06.715 --> 25:09.384
You're the only thing in my life
I'm proud of right now.

25:10.219 --> 25:11.386
Austin, what's wrong?

25:12.304 --> 25:14.515
Nothing, just believe me.

25:15.098 --> 25:19.311
Your poetry, that's real.
You have something that's real.

25:19.394 --> 25:21.021
If I had something like that...

25:22.689 --> 25:24.107
Well, I'd be happy.

25:24.691 --> 25:27.528
-Hey, Mr. Dickinson.
-Austin.

25:28.904 --> 25:29.988
Look. There's my ride.

25:52.469 --> 25:53.470
Oops.

25:57.099 --> 25:58.725
-What's up, girl?
-Hey.

25:59.685 --> 26:05.858
May I introduce to you the great
and recently late Mr. Edgar Allan Poe.

26:05.941 --> 26:08.235
Yeah, that's me. You want an autograph?

26:08.318 --> 26:10.070
Wow. I can't believe you're here.

26:10.946 --> 26:12.322
He just died a few years ago.

26:12.406 --> 26:15.742
That's right, I'm a ghost,
the ghost of Edgar Allan Poe.

26:16.243 --> 26:19.371
Died of mysterious circumstances.
Very on-brand.

26:19.454 --> 26:21.540
No, you drank yourself to death, bruh.

26:22.249 --> 26:23.250
All right.

26:24.001 --> 26:25.294
Well, you're here to see me.

26:25.377 --> 26:27.087
Wonderful. Love meeting my fans.

26:27.171 --> 26:29.965
So, nod when I get to your favorite.

26:30.048 --> 26:33.635
"The Raven," "Tell-Tale Heart,"
"Annabel Lee."

26:33.719 --> 26:35.137
You're not nodding.

26:35.512 --> 26:39.391
"The Fall of the House of Usher,"
"The Cask of Amontillado"--

26:39.474 --> 26:40.559
I've only read "The Raven."

26:40.642 --> 26:41.810
Copy that.

26:42.644 --> 26:44.479
I mean this in the nicest possible way,

26:44.563 --> 26:46.481
but I thought
that we were gonna drive around

26:46.565 --> 26:48.609
and find fans of mine
for me to sleep with.

26:49.651 --> 26:51.236
She's more of a fan of mines, bro.

26:51.320 --> 26:52.321
Yes.

26:52.404 --> 26:54.114
The death of a beautiful woman

26:54.198 --> 26:58.368
is unquestionably
the most poetical topic in the world.

27:02.414 --> 27:03.540
Can you drop me off at Sue's?

27:03.624 --> 27:05.000
Who's Sue? She put out?

27:05.083 --> 27:07.544
Sue is my best friend.
She's throwing me a party.

27:08.170 --> 27:10.005
A literary party.

27:10.088 --> 27:13.509
To celebrate my work
because I am also a famous writer.

27:13.592 --> 27:16.136
Really? Who's your publisher?
Wiley and Putnam?

27:16.595 --> 27:19.932
I just published a poem
in The Springfield Republican.

27:20.682 --> 27:22.392
I'm sorry, did you say
the New-York Tribune?

27:22.809 --> 27:25.437
No. The... Springfield--

27:25.521 --> 27:26.939
He heard what you said.

27:27.814 --> 27:29.024
He's just being rude.

27:30.025 --> 27:32.736
One poem in a newspaper,
you think you're hot shit.

27:33.570 --> 27:35.572
I mean this with all due respect,

27:35.656 --> 27:39.243
I have no idea who you are,
and it is too late for me to learn.

27:39.326 --> 27:43.247
My dear young lady,
you do not even know what fame is.

27:43.330 --> 27:45.582
Okay, it's not just one poem.

27:46.166 --> 27:48.669
-Oh, yeah?
-The editor is publishing more.

27:51.255 --> 27:52.673
-They got you.
-What?

27:52.756 --> 27:56.301
Fame is an addiction. Get one little taste
and look at you, you're hooked.

27:56.385 --> 27:58.929
And you'll keep searching
for that next high.

27:59.012 --> 28:02.099
Rich or poor. Known or obscure.

28:02.182 --> 28:04.434
But it'll never be enough.
I mean, look at me.

28:04.518 --> 28:08.397
I'm famous as shit and I'm dead as shit.

28:09.231 --> 28:13.068
And I'm rolling around town
in Death's carriage,

28:13.151 --> 28:17.155
looking for a woman
who will make me like myself.

28:19.324 --> 28:20.325
Till the end of time.

28:20.409 --> 28:21.994
Whoa. Not till the end of time.

28:22.953 --> 28:24.705
You gotta get out of here at some point.

28:24.788 --> 28:26.874
Can you just read me my obituary again?

28:26.957 --> 28:28.625
Oh, my God. Let it go.

28:28.709 --> 28:32.296
Damn. I miss my cousin/child bride,
Virginia.

28:32.379 --> 28:34.381
She would have read me my obituary.

28:37.885 --> 28:38.886
Fame...

28:42.139 --> 28:43.182
is a bee.

28:44.057 --> 28:45.475
-What?
-I like that.

28:47.227 --> 28:48.353
I am so drunk.

28:50.147 --> 28:51.523
Should we drop you off?

28:52.316 --> 28:53.317
No.

28:54.651 --> 28:56.778
No, let's ride around a little longer.

28:56.862 --> 28:58.280
I wanna be fashionably late.

28:59.072 --> 29:00.991
What about you? Got anywhere to be?

29:01.074 --> 29:02.701
Nah, bro. Nevermore.

29:26.308 --> 29:27.309
Sue?

29:31.146 --> 29:32.397
Sue?

29:36.443 --> 29:37.736
Where are you?

30:03.220 --> 30:04.429
That's where I'll go.

30:07.975 --> 30:09.184
My words.

30:14.815 --> 30:15.816
Sue.

30:19.111 --> 30:21.446
Sue, you were right.
You were right about everything.

30:21.530 --> 30:24.116
I want to be seen by people.

30:24.199 --> 30:25.576
I wanna be seen by you.

30:26.535 --> 30:27.536
Sue?

30:27.911 --> 30:29.830
It's okay. Nobody's here.
