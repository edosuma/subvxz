15:27.426 --> 15:31.387

further away from the blob than that.
That was not far enough.

my pants when you
turned in towards the building.

That was heavy.
I didn't go very far out.

in their apartment building

Hi. Whoo.

into the ground.

Ow! Ow, ow, ow!
My- [ Bleeps ]- ass.

16:10.970 --> 16:14.472
If Tommy had bounced the
other way, he would have blobbed
himself right off the building,

16:14.556 --> 16:17.100
and that would have been
the end of Tommy.

a couple cheeseburgers
coming your way.

over that building safely.

it just always boiled down to-

The difference
between Jackass
and Nitro...

was our Jackass stunts

to take out Parks.
