WEBVTT

00:05.039 --> 00:06.340
Whoa!

00:06.374 --> 00:08.376
(car horns honking)

00:12.846 --> 00:14.848
(intro to "Another Day of Sun"
tune from La La Land)

00:16.417 --> 00:18.586
* Another Springfield day *

00:18.619 --> 00:22.223
* A truly perfect place to see
your dreams just fade away *

00:22.256 --> 00:26.060
* Working at the plant's fried
everything inside my pants *

00:26.094 --> 00:30.331
* Good-bye to all romance *

00:30.364 --> 00:34.668
* All I've got to show
for 20 years or so is you *

00:34.702 --> 00:37.271
-Carl!
-Prescription pain pills!

00:37.305 --> 00:39.240
* I have a law degree *

00:39.273 --> 00:41.209
* For years I've smelled
just like cat pee *

00:41.242 --> 00:42.876
* This town
just drags you down *

00:42.910 --> 00:44.745
* She's completely
lost her head *

00:44.778 --> 00:46.914
* And we will eat her
when she's dead *

00:46.947 --> 00:49.417
* It really shouldn't be
too long *

00:49.450 --> 00:52.886
-* Cats! Cats! Cats! *
-* She'll be our dinner *

00:52.920 --> 00:54.755
* This truly is an awful town *

00:54.788 --> 00:56.724
* The water's green,
the sky is brown *

00:56.757 --> 00:58.526
* Pope Francis came,
he turned around *

00:58.559 --> 01:00.561
* Our strongest bridge
just holds ten pounds *

01:00.594 --> 01:02.230
* We're poisoned
by a greedy clown *

01:02.263 --> 01:04.598
* Kang-a-roo meat! *

01:04.632 --> 01:08.136
* Traffic suffers
from paralysis *

01:08.169 --> 01:11.972
Please.
I'm late for my dialysis.

01:12.005 --> 01:13.974
* It's another
Springfield day *

01:14.007 --> 01:15.909
* Oh, oh, oh, oh *

01:15.943 --> 01:17.745
* I'm too sad to say olÃ© *

01:17.778 --> 01:20.314
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh *

01:20.348 --> 01:21.815
* We've lost our coolest gays *

01:21.849 --> 01:23.817
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh *

01:23.851 --> 01:25.886
Duffman thinks
this town's okay!

01:25.919 --> 01:27.555
* Oh, oh, oh, oh *

01:27.588 --> 01:30.991
* It's another
Springfield day! *

01:31.024 --> 01:32.660
(people screaming)

01:32.693 --> 01:35.996
(laughing)
Lenny's a survivor!

01:36.029 --> 01:37.998
LISA:
* This will be a perfect day *

01:38.031 --> 01:40.168
* No way
to go outside and play *

01:40.201 --> 01:41.735
* And so we're on our way *

01:41.769 --> 01:44.172
* To a very nerdy
science conference *

01:44.205 --> 01:46.106
* Ba-ba ba-ba-dum
ba-dum, ba-ba *

01:46.140 --> 01:47.775
* Bum-bum, ba-ba-dum,
ba-da, ba-ba *

01:47.808 --> 01:49.177
Take it Bart!

01:49.210 --> 01:50.744
If you're givin' it,
I don't want it.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.413
Bring it home, boy.

01:52.446 --> 01:55.949
* My sister sucks! *

01:55.983 --> 01:58.186
Nyah, nyah.

01:58.219 --> 02:01.789
* It's another perfect day! *

02:01.822 --> 02:03.324
I brought my stems.

02:03.357 --> 02:04.825
Sir, this is a conference

02:04.858 --> 02:08.462
of Science, Technology,
Engineering and Math.

02:08.496 --> 02:10.130
What about this one?

02:10.164 --> 02:12.533
Dialogue on Pediatric Education.

02:12.566 --> 02:14.468
(whooshing)

02:14.502 --> 02:15.869
(mumbling)

02:15.903 --> 02:18.539
I find this claim highly doyvik.

02:18.572 --> 02:21.542
It's all true according
to the highly-prestigious

02:21.575 --> 02:23.444
Institute for Purchased Science.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.313
Here's our top scientist now.

02:25.346 --> 02:27.781
Sir, I-I don't think
this is fooling anyone.

02:27.815 --> 02:30.150
Quiet! And put on the monocle,
Professor Noodle-Strudel.

02:30.184 --> 02:33.221
(Smithers sighs)

02:33.254 --> 02:35.155
-So where's your booth?
-I don't have one.

02:35.189 --> 02:37.858
-I just came here for fun.
-Fun?!

02:37.891 --> 02:39.793
One child, please.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.161
I was here first.

02:41.195 --> 02:43.997
If disco's dead,
I don't want to live.

02:44.031 --> 02:46.234
It's Stuicide!

02:46.267 --> 02:48.736
Self-unrolling yoga mats.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.738
(rhythmic whirring)

02:50.771 --> 02:54.375
Artificial intelligence
that writes TV recaps.

02:54.408 --> 02:58.512
Stranger Things suffers
from season two fatigue.

02:58.546 --> 03:01.649
And look! IMAX Al Gore!

03:01.682 --> 03:05.519
If every family could just
reduce their carbon footprint

03:05.553 --> 03:07.655
by ten percent...

03:07.688 --> 03:09.323
Oh, it's hopeless.

03:09.357 --> 03:10.991
The floods are comin', people!

03:11.024 --> 03:13.227
This is my Woodstock!

03:13.261 --> 03:15.929
(woozy laugh)

03:15.963 --> 03:17.665
You okay, honey?

03:17.698 --> 03:19.099
(slurring words):
It's fine. It's fine.

03:19.132 --> 03:21.335
I'm just intellectually drunk.

03:21.369 --> 03:23.871
Mm. I guess that's okay.

03:23.904 --> 03:26.039
Marge, Marge, Marge,
you lighten up.

03:26.073 --> 03:27.408
It's science.

03:27.441 --> 03:28.876
Maybe you should sit down.

03:28.909 --> 03:31.712
I ain't sittin'.
I'm ready to fly!

03:31.745 --> 03:33.314
Hmm.

03:38.652 --> 03:40.721
Hey, kid,
I want to show you something.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.290
Are you a pervert?

03:42.323 --> 03:43.924
No. A chemical engineer.

03:43.957 --> 03:46.026
(crying):
No!

03:46.059 --> 03:47.528
I used to be like you.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.463
You mean incredibly bored?

03:49.497 --> 03:51.865
Oh, let's see
if you think this is boring.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.602
I drop a little water
on powdered sodium...

03:54.635 --> 03:55.869
BART:
Huh?!

03:55.903 --> 03:57.305
Wow!

03:57.338 --> 03:59.072
Listen, I don't know
what you're teaching,

03:59.106 --> 04:00.974
but you and I have
great chemistry.

04:01.008 --> 04:02.476
Except for the lab coat.

04:02.510 --> 04:04.645
It makes you look
kind of heavy.

04:04.678 --> 04:07.715
I actually am kind of heavy,
and it makes me look thinner!

04:07.748 --> 04:11.084
I don't know what could make
this day more perfect.

04:11.118 --> 04:13.287
(jazz plays on piano)

04:13.321 --> 04:14.855
(gasps)

04:19.493 --> 04:21.462
You didn't applaud.
Nothing.

04:21.495 --> 04:23.497
Here, I'll show ya how it goes.

04:24.698 --> 04:28.001
Thank you.
No selfies.

04:28.035 --> 04:30.170
LISA: In a lesser musician,
that boy's attitude

04:30.203 --> 04:32.606
would be needy
masquerading as arrogance.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.442
I'm leaving if he can't sing.

04:34.475 --> 04:37.110
* I've had my share
of crazy flings *

04:37.144 --> 04:39.580
* But they all end up leavin' *

04:39.613 --> 04:43.617
* And leavin',
well, it really stings... *

04:43.651 --> 04:46.620
LISA: Oh, God.
He's one small step away

04:46.654 --> 04:49.523
from destroying
all my logic and reason.

04:49.557 --> 04:52.259
*

04:52.292 --> 04:54.161
Ah. Ah. Ah.

04:54.194 --> 04:55.763
MILHOUSE:
Hey, Lisa.

04:55.796 --> 04:59.633
I brought you three waters:
cold, lukewarm and warm.

04:59.667 --> 05:02.636
-That's nice. Any sparkling?
-Damn it!

05:05.072 --> 05:08.175
Hi. I'm Lisa Simpson,
and I'm nervous

05:08.208 --> 05:10.644
about saying anything that will
ruin this perfect moment.

05:10.678 --> 05:12.312
My name's Brendan.

05:12.346 --> 05:14.648
Oh, good, good.
No last names.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.984
Don't want things
moving too fast.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.787
Oh! I hope
our children get his hair.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.055
Now to subtly find out
how old he is.

05:22.089 --> 05:23.791
How old are you?

05:23.824 --> 05:26.494
Well, I'm 11, but I'm insouciant
at a 12th grade level,

05:26.527 --> 05:27.895
and I'm talented, too.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.563
(laughs)
So unfair, right?

05:29.597 --> 05:33.066
That's amazing, because
the boys I know are re...

05:33.100 --> 05:34.568
I've got sparkling!

05:34.602 --> 05:36.236
Sorry, I'm not thirsty anymore.

05:36.269 --> 05:37.971
Damn it!

05:38.005 --> 05:40.708
Um, so w-where do you go
to school?

05:40.741 --> 05:42.543
I just moved here.
I'm starting next week

05:42.576 --> 05:44.077
at a school called
Springfield Elementary.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.246
I see it got
a few dreadful reviews on Yelp.

05:46.279 --> 05:48.482
This guy called "Gary Chalmers"
gave it half a star.

05:48.516 --> 05:49.883
Bloody hell!

05:49.917 --> 05:52.520
Of all the K through sixes
in this world,

05:52.553 --> 05:54.522
you had to walk into mine.

05:54.555 --> 05:58.225
A beautiful hotel bar!
Just like in The Shining!

05:58.258 --> 06:00.661
Oh, hi, lee... tle girl.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.597
If you see your ma...
uh, ma wife,

06:03.631 --> 06:07.435
tell her Homer-- not your dad--
wants the credit card.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.403
I will... sir.

06:09.437 --> 06:11.905
-Sir? I'm your dad.
-D'oh!

06:11.939 --> 06:13.340
MAN (German accent):
Today, we are performing

06:13.373 --> 06:15.743
an experiment that
we humorously call

06:15.776 --> 06:18.278
"making elephant toothpaste."

06:18.311 --> 06:21.281
Boy, the Germans
sure know their humor.

06:21.314 --> 06:23.551
Let's just hope they know
something about chemistry.

06:23.584 --> 06:28.355
First, add a tablespoon of
dish soap to hydrogen peroxide,

06:28.388 --> 06:31.258
then add the warm water
and the yeast!

06:34.428 --> 06:35.863
(explosion)

06:35.896 --> 06:37.865
Aah! German chemistry!

06:37.898 --> 06:39.633
-(whimpering)
-(boys laughing)

06:39.667 --> 06:42.269
(saxophone and piano
play lively, upbeat jazz)

06:49.176 --> 06:51.479
Sounds great, Lisa.
Really great.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.313
You're just a little
behind the beat.

06:53.346 --> 06:56.149
Uh, maybe you're a little ahead?

06:56.183 --> 06:59.319
Aw, you're so cute
when you're wrong.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.589
-Channel that rage!
-No!

07:01.622 --> 07:03.423
Make that reed pay for my sins!

07:03.457 --> 07:06.226
(playing lively jazz)

07:06.259 --> 07:07.995
Yeah!

07:08.028 --> 07:10.464
-(banging on wall)
-HOMER: Knock off that racket!

07:10.498 --> 07:12.232
It's not a racket!

07:12.265 --> 07:14.735
It's the truest
American art form!

07:14.768 --> 07:17.971
Banging on the walls is
the truest American art form,

07:18.005 --> 07:19.573
and I'm a Picasso!

07:19.607 --> 07:21.509
(banging rhythmically to music)

07:21.542 --> 07:24.344
Oh, no! They're playing in time
to the beat of my banging!

07:24.377 --> 07:26.914
Well, then stop banging.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.316
I can't.
The rhythm is infectious.

07:29.349 --> 07:31.485
(banging rhythmically
to music)

07:38.692 --> 07:41.194
Here's the school trophy case.

07:41.228 --> 07:43.363
If you look closely, it's empty.

07:43.396 --> 07:45.833
They're actually decals
on the glass.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.370
-Oh, hello, Lisa.
-(gasps)

07:50.403 --> 07:52.005
I see you have a new friend.

07:52.039 --> 07:54.207
Brendan, this is Nelson.

07:54.241 --> 07:56.544
Lisa, you sure know
a lot of weird guys.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.045
Hello, Brenda.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.548
Excuse me.
Why is being a girl an insult?

08:00.581 --> 08:02.650
Ah! So evolved!

08:02.683 --> 08:05.385
Lisa, are you squishy
for this ding-dong?

08:05.418 --> 08:08.221
Lisa, does that fat kid
like you?

08:09.757 --> 08:12.693
(laughs) Whatever we had,
it's in the past.

08:15.162 --> 08:18.566
I think there's something
in the water in this town.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.603
(whistles)

08:24.237 --> 08:26.640
(laughter)

08:26.674 --> 08:28.375
Oh, man.

08:28.408 --> 08:30.210
* On a playground I tripped *

08:30.243 --> 08:31.712
(girls sigh)

08:31.745 --> 08:34.147
* Then I saw you and flipped *

08:34.181 --> 08:36.216
He used "flipped"
with a double meaning!

08:36.249 --> 08:37.818
Bastard!

08:37.851 --> 08:40.053
* Now I'm skippin' *

08:40.087 --> 08:43.056
* And trippin' for you. *

08:43.090 --> 08:45.392
He turned his suffering
into entertainment,

08:45.425 --> 08:46.994
just like the Jewish people!

08:47.027 --> 08:49.396
Nothing can ruin this moment.

08:49.429 --> 08:51.364
Make way.
Dead gophers.

08:51.398 --> 08:52.900
Nothing!

08:52.933 --> 08:55.603
(lively jazz playing)

08:55.636 --> 08:57.871
How can you be sleeping?!

08:57.905 --> 09:00.874
(grunting)

09:00.908 --> 09:02.743
Oh, thank God.

09:02.776 --> 09:07.180
Meanwhile, Bart's teacher says
he has a flair for chemistry.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.682
Why that little...

09:08.716 --> 09:11.184
Wait. Flair?
Isn't that a good thing?

09:11.218 --> 09:13.053
Yes. It's too good.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.989
-(whistling)
-(liquid gurgling)

09:17.825 --> 09:19.627
(gargling)

09:19.660 --> 09:21.528
Why don't you ask him
what he's up to?

09:21.561 --> 09:25.098
Because if he lies to me,
it's like a dagger in my heart.

09:25.132 --> 09:28.468
What happens when--
I mean if-- I ever lie to you?

09:28.501 --> 09:30.771
Can you find out
what he's really up to?

09:30.804 --> 09:32.906
-I will.
-See? That's a lie right there.

09:32.940 --> 09:35.242
D'oh! Okay, I really will.

09:35.275 --> 09:37.210
-That's also a lie.
-D'oh!

09:37.244 --> 09:39.647
Fine.
I really, really, really will.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.749
Finally, the truth.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.550
(Homer panting heavily)

09:43.583 --> 09:45.252
HOMER:
Keeping... promise.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.087
(Homer panting heavily)

09:47.120 --> 09:48.588
Stupid tree house.

09:48.622 --> 09:50.991
(panting)
So far off the ground.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.492
(panting heavily)

09:52.525 --> 09:54.895
Uh, Dad, you haven't even
started to climb yet.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.064
I have to visualize it first.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.132
(groans)

10:00.033 --> 10:01.268
Thanks, guys.

10:01.301 --> 10:02.670
Ah, no problem.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.271
Why did we do that, Chief?

10:04.304 --> 10:06.173
Fat man courtesy, Lou.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.941
Fat man courtesy.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.410
Son, how do I put this?

10:10.443 --> 10:12.780
Are you breaking bad up here?

10:12.813 --> 10:14.281
No, I'm not.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.516
And if you're looking for meth,
go see Cletus.

10:16.549 --> 10:18.686
-What?!
-(beeps)

10:18.719 --> 10:23.957
Meth Life, proud sponsor
of the 2020 Opioid Olympics!

10:23.991 --> 10:25.525
(squeals)

10:25.558 --> 10:28.428
Ooh, that's street ready!

10:28.461 --> 10:30.864
Dad, I'm just trying
to follow in your footsteps.

10:30.898 --> 10:33.701
You work in science,
and I think that's really cool.

10:33.734 --> 10:36.169
Wow, you've never
said that to me before.

10:36.203 --> 10:38.371
Do you want to go to work
with me today?

10:38.405 --> 10:39.973
You can help me
research my theory

10:40.007 --> 10:41.975
that the chairs can go flat.

10:42.009 --> 10:45.946
I'd like to, but I've got to do
some colloidal titration.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.180
(Homer whimpers)

10:47.214 --> 10:50.017
Marge, it's worse
than we thought.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.351
He's speaking in tongues.

10:51.384 --> 10:52.853
He's a religious weirdo.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.187
The worst thing there is.

10:54.221 --> 10:55.956
Cover your eyes, boys--

10:55.989 --> 10:59.492
I'm about to flip Mr. Simpson
the "Flanders finger."

10:59.526 --> 11:01.394
(gasps)
You mean...

11:01.428 --> 11:04.798
Yup-- a thumbs-up
without a friendly wink.

11:04.832 --> 11:06.834
(boys whimpering)

11:08.769 --> 11:10.537
You have a credit card?

11:10.570 --> 11:12.139
Yeah, but no money.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.742
Oh, a true jazz musician.

11:21.882 --> 11:24.351
*

11:35.028 --> 11:37.497
(exclaims)
Just give the ice cream back.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.067
No way. It was
really hard to scoop.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.170
(door bell tinkles)

11:43.203 --> 11:45.438
Prepare to have
your ears belted.

11:48.308 --> 11:51.378
* My funny valentine *

11:51.411 --> 11:54.882
* Sweet, comic valentine *

11:54.915 --> 11:55.883
Nelson?

11:55.916 --> 11:58.685
* You make me smile *

11:58.718 --> 12:01.588
* With my heart *

12:03.490 --> 12:05.692
Stop! Why are you doing this?

12:05.725 --> 12:08.361
I don't know. There's no
good word for what I feel.

12:08.395 --> 12:11.531
Scared and excited
at the same time.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.533
There is a word: vulnerable.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.602
"Vulner-able"?

12:17.737 --> 12:19.406
Yup.
I always liked you,

12:19.439 --> 12:22.309
but now I'm seeing you
in a new light.

12:26.579 --> 12:29.316
* Your looks are laughable *

12:29.349 --> 12:30.784
Haw-haw!

12:30.818 --> 12:33.620
* Unphotographable *

12:33.653 --> 12:36.790
* But you're my favorite *

12:36.824 --> 12:38.892
(off-key):
* Work of art *

12:38.926 --> 12:39.893
(low):
* Art *

12:39.927 --> 12:40.961
(lower): * Art *

12:40.994 --> 12:42.095
(way off-key):
* Art. *

12:42.129 --> 12:43.663
Nailed it.
(grunts)

12:47.835 --> 12:51.071
And so now
there's a jazz war over me.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.740
It's pretty bad.
But it's pretty great.

12:53.773 --> 12:57.344
Uh-huh. Scotland once had two
queens fightin' over her.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.112
Loser got Scotland.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.014
Of course, Brendan
is the superior artist.

13:01.048 --> 13:02.649
But that kind of intimidates me.

13:02.682 --> 13:04.351
And Nelson's rough,
but he's sweet.

13:04.384 --> 13:05.853
Plus he thinks I have dimples.

13:05.886 --> 13:08.155
Dimples?
It's that serious?

13:08.188 --> 13:10.690
-(Scottish accent): Aye.
-Let me give ye advice on love.

13:10.723 --> 13:13.660
The Scottish national flower
is the thistle.

13:13.693 --> 13:15.662
A humble weed.
Legend has it

13:15.695 --> 13:17.464
that the Norse King Haakon

13:17.497 --> 13:19.833
staged a surprise invasion.

13:19.867 --> 13:23.003
But his barefooted army
stepped on thistles,

13:23.036 --> 13:26.039
and their screams
awakened the sleepy Scots.

13:28.575 --> 13:31.879
Many a Norwegian lass
lamented their dead lover

13:31.912 --> 13:34.214
-on that glorious day.
-SKINNER: Willie,

13:34.247 --> 13:37.050
someone spiked the teachers'
vodka with sulfuric acid.

13:37.084 --> 13:39.386
Superintendent Chalmers
lost the tip of his tongue.

13:39.419 --> 13:40.988
Kin-ner!

13:41.021 --> 13:43.456
(sighs)

13:43.490 --> 13:45.325
Lisa, this is a song about you.

13:45.358 --> 13:47.627
-A kid who's almost there.
-(grumbles)

13:47.660 --> 13:49.629
And when you get there,
you'll blow the roof off.

13:49.662 --> 13:50.797
Oh.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.832
*

13:56.103 --> 13:59.072
Yeah, well,
I brought my washboard.

13:59.106 --> 14:02.375
(scraping)

14:02.409 --> 14:04.844
Nelson.
You took our washboard.

14:04.878 --> 14:08.548
I got thongs to scrub.

14:09.616 --> 14:10.850
I really can't believe

14:10.884 --> 14:12.152
that this is a choice.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.386
I mean, look at me.

14:13.420 --> 14:14.754
And look at him.

14:14.787 --> 14:16.789
And then look back at me.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.993
Hmm, they're quiet.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.728
Too quiet.

14:21.761 --> 14:23.730
(Bart and Milhouse laugh)

14:23.763 --> 14:25.065
Now they're loud.

14:25.098 --> 14:26.366
Too loud.

14:26.399 --> 14:27.734
(Bart and Milhouse chuckle)

14:27.767 --> 14:29.736
Now they're just right.

14:29.769 --> 14:31.371
Too just right.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.506
Are you sure
Bart's not planning anything?

14:33.540 --> 14:35.508
A boy takes his cues
from his mother.

14:35.542 --> 14:38.078
If I trust him,
then he'll be good.

14:38.111 --> 14:40.380
Hey, don't knock
my mother's method--

14:40.413 --> 14:42.515
complete abandonment
from age five.

14:42.549 --> 14:45.185
(Bart and Milhouse giggle)

14:45.218 --> 14:46.186
HOMER:
Hmm.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.421
The school talent show.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.924
And on the back,
chemical equations.

14:50.958 --> 14:52.459
Still think he's innocent?

14:52.492 --> 14:54.827
We'll just have to go there
and see.

14:57.464 --> 15:00.433
You wanted rock candy,
you got rock candy.

15:00.467 --> 15:01.801
Mmm.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.971
Brendan and Nelson are fighting.

15:04.004 --> 15:07.640
I'm getting Daddy's gun
to under-arrest them.

15:07.674 --> 15:08.641
Oh, no.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.877
I'm gonna call you decrescendo,

15:10.910 --> 15:12.946
'cause you're goin' down.

15:12.980 --> 15:14.547
Nelson, that's clever.

15:14.581 --> 15:17.650
Thanks. For you, I read a book.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.720
All right, Ralphie,
easy, easy.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.755
Give Daddy back his hat.

15:24.191 --> 15:27.594
Oh, you missed everything,
just like Daddy.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.530
(saxophone playing)

15:31.864 --> 15:34.067
Ugh, so many clams.

15:34.101 --> 15:37.837
Well, you're gonna look
very nice for the show tonight.

15:37.870 --> 15:40.240
It doesn't matter how I look,
I'm not ready.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.775
I've been so distracted
by those boys.

15:42.809 --> 15:44.344
How did you choose Dad?

15:44.377 --> 15:45.912
And never regret it?

15:45.945 --> 15:47.847
HOMER:
Marge, I might've swallowed

15:47.880 --> 15:49.882
a couple of your earrings.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.553
Gotta go.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.256
(Marge humming)

15:56.289 --> 15:59.526
I do not want to know
how you got these back.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.461
So, we're really doing it.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.496
We're going to a talent show

16:03.530 --> 16:06.799
where Bart is putting on
a chemistry demonstration.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.168
Have I got that right?

16:08.201 --> 16:10.503
If our faces
get melted off today,

16:10.537 --> 16:12.772
I want the last thing Bart sees

16:12.805 --> 16:14.874
to be us believing in him.

16:14.907 --> 16:17.144
Fine, fine.
Let me just finish my will.

16:22.015 --> 16:23.683
And... (exclaims)

16:23.716 --> 16:25.885
Oh, it's good
to have that taken care of.

16:25.918 --> 16:28.221
(orchestra warming up)

16:28.255 --> 16:31.324
(singing scales): * Haw-haw-haw,
haw-haw-haw, haw. *

16:31.358 --> 16:32.959
Nelson? A word?

16:32.992 --> 16:34.394
Take five, Martin.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.063
I'm not even in your act.

16:36.096 --> 16:38.498
-I said take five.
-(whimpers)

16:38.531 --> 16:40.067
Ooh!

16:40.100 --> 16:42.702
Nelson, I cherish
our unhealthy relationship.

16:42.735 --> 16:45.405
Especially the fact
that I can tell you the truth.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.507
Kiddo, you're not a singer.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.409
Okay, fine, I won't sing.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.144
But I'll still perform.

16:51.178 --> 16:54.347
That's how much I want
to hold your stupid hand.

16:54.381 --> 16:55.582
Oh.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.884
You're up, Nelson.

17:00.387 --> 17:01.854
Hello.

17:01.888 --> 17:03.756
I'm the school bully.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.725
(audience booing)

17:05.758 --> 17:07.094
Aw, don't be a dingus.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.695
I'm the next Charlie Mingus.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.063
-(gasps)
-(Nelson playing bass)

17:10.097 --> 17:11.731
Could I really choose him?

17:11.764 --> 17:14.534
*

17:28.115 --> 17:30.583
(gasps)
My choice is clear: Brendan.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.185
*

17:32.219 --> 17:34.121
-(booing) -MAN: Ooh, yeah,
I feel the groove.

17:36.923 --> 17:39.892
Next contestant,
Brendan Beiderbecke.

17:42.795 --> 17:44.297
And Brendan wins!

17:44.331 --> 17:45.732
(lisping):
Not so fast.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.800
We have a disqualification.

17:47.834 --> 17:50.870
This young man does not
live in the district.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.440
Right, his home is 50 feet
into West Springfield,

17:53.473 --> 17:55.608
which means he will be
transferred to a school

17:55.642 --> 17:59.045
three buses and a long bike ride
away from here.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.913
-Brendan...
-No, Lisa.

18:00.947 --> 18:02.249
I can't put you through that.

18:02.282 --> 18:03.983
I guess this
relationship is over

18:04.016 --> 18:07.454
until this town
invests in mass transit.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.090
(cries)

18:11.124 --> 18:14.261
I'll never see him again.

18:14.294 --> 18:17.063
Lisa, I'm glad
you didn't choose me.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.132
No woman is worth
learning music.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.800
All this time
I've been choosing jazz

18:20.833 --> 18:22.669
over doing my reps.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.971
Well, my reps never let me down.

18:25.004 --> 18:27.006
Lift weights, get dates.

18:27.039 --> 18:29.142
Lift weights,
get dates.

18:29.176 --> 18:31.844
Well, I guess I'm alone
for the moment.

18:31.878 --> 18:33.680
And I like it.

18:33.713 --> 18:35.448
-Good for Lisa.
-She's better off alone.

18:35.482 --> 18:36.983
She doesn't need a man.

18:37.016 --> 18:38.785
Wait a minute, everybody.
Even though

18:38.818 --> 18:40.820
the most interesting and
emotionally compelling part

18:40.853 --> 18:42.822
is over, we still
have one performer

18:42.855 --> 18:45.625
who says he will
"blow you away."

18:45.658 --> 18:49.095
So please welcome the original
Dennis the Chemist,

18:49.128 --> 18:50.663
Bart Simpson.

18:50.697 --> 18:52.699
*

18:57.204 --> 18:59.806
Drop the beaker, Screwy Pasteur.

18:59.839 --> 19:01.174
(chuckles)

19:01.208 --> 19:03.943
No.
I wasn't doing anything bad.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.512
Pour the beaker and you'll see.

19:05.545 --> 19:08.348
We are not gonna let you
mix those chemicals.

19:08.381 --> 19:10.350
We got a tip
from an anonymous source

19:10.383 --> 19:12.219
named Seymour Skinner.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.721
Do you even know
what "anonymous" means?

19:14.754 --> 19:16.489
Uh, helpful?

19:16.523 --> 19:17.624
(Marge groans)

19:17.657 --> 19:19.125
Mom, I'm innocent.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.727
You believe me, don't you?

19:20.760 --> 19:23.230
Oh, if he's lying,
I'll never forgive him.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.898
If he's telling the truth,
he'll never forgive me.

19:25.932 --> 19:29.236
(short chuckle)
Glad I'm not you.

19:29.269 --> 19:32.405
Bart, sweetie,
I'll pour the beaker for you.

19:32.439 --> 19:34.140
(yelps, whimpers)

19:34.173 --> 19:36.042
(grunting)

19:38.110 --> 19:40.112
*

19:46.286 --> 19:48.221
ALL:
Ooh!

19:48.255 --> 19:50.290
Ah!

19:52.124 --> 19:54.561
He's innocent. But then
who put the sulfuric acid

19:54.594 --> 19:56.062
in Superintendent Chalmers'
drink?

19:56.095 --> 19:57.597
I did.

19:57.630 --> 20:00.099
-Willie! Why?
-Why?

20:00.132 --> 20:03.236
Because, Seymour,
I was trying to kill you.

20:03.270 --> 20:05.572
(lisping):
Well, that's okay. Good man.

20:05.605 --> 20:07.106
-But...
-Quiet, Seymour.

20:07.139 --> 20:08.775
The man's got a dream.

20:08.808 --> 20:10.443
Mmm.

20:10.477 --> 20:13.413
I never doubted you.

20:13.446 --> 20:14.981
Well, you should have.

20:17.484 --> 20:19.486
*

20:25.224 --> 20:27.226
(indistinct chatter, laughter)

20:30.263 --> 20:33.065
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

20:33.099 --> 20:35.201
This episode was supposed
to have been a parody

20:35.234 --> 20:38.204
of Moonlight,
not La La Land.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.573
Moonlight?
But none of us have seen it.

20:40.607 --> 20:43.142
We have the DVD.
We could watch it tonight.

20:43.175 --> 20:45.478
Either that
or X-Men: Apocalypse.

20:45.512 --> 20:46.979
ALL:
X-Men!

20:47.013 --> 20:49.015
I'd like to see Moonlight.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.157
Shh.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.995
