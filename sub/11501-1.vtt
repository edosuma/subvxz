01:15.625 --> 01:19.000
Whoa! Unidentified flying object

01:33.417 --> 01:35.417
And spin up. Woo!

01:35.958 --> 01:38.333
B-girl, you got some sick moves.

01:38.542 --> 01:41.083
Yeah, she could probably do something nuts.
- Oh, yeah? Try this.

02:04.333 --> 02:08.167
Everyone knows they've got bigger fish
to fry than breakdancing, okay?

02:10.250 --> 02:13.250
Yeah, I've got, like...
tunas to fry.

02:14.500 --> 02:15.792
Wow...

02:21.208 --> 02:24.375
I found literally
the best dress at Grandma's.

02:24.583 --> 02:25.792
So good, right?

02:25.958 --> 02:28.417
Don't worry, Molly,
I brought you a dress.

02:28.625 --> 02:31.083
No need. I'm going
for my goihic Lifile Bo Peep.

02:31.292 --> 02:34.292
Okay, well, you can't,
'cause that's Alicia's thing.

02:34.500 --> 02:37.083
Though you would look good
with some cheek piercings.

02:37.292 --> 02:38.750
No one's doing that right now.

02:38.958 --> 02:41.583
Uh, Molly, a word?

02:45.583 --> 02:50.167
Do you wont me to clear out?
- No, it's cool, Ben.

02:50.375 --> 02:52.625
We're all stuck on this planet together.

02:53.458 --> 02:55.417
So, alien,

02:55.625 --> 02:58.792
banjo, graphic-novelling
and now breakdance.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.542
You were completely devoted
to each of these.

03:01.750 --> 03:03.458
I was.

03:04.833 --> 03:05.792
And then I wasn't

03:05.958 --> 03:08.667
Ben, you should hear
this girl play banjo.

03:08.875 --> 03:11.042
Clawhammer?
- I know, I know.

03:11.250 --> 03:13.625
I'm the next Matokie Slaughte.

03:13.833 --> 03:16.333
Come see me Monday with a plan.

03:17.542 --> 03:21.625
If you don't like the electives on offer,
you can pick anything in the entire universe.

03:21.833 --> 03:23.708
A parallel universe, even.

03:23.917 --> 03:26.208
But you'd better do it quickly,

03:26.417 --> 03:29.167
because it's frickin' March.

03:33.250 --> 03:34.583
Leaf broccoli?

03:40.625 --> 03:44.250
Come, you spirits that tend
on mortal thoughts,

03:44.458 --> 03:46.333
unsex me here.

03:47.333 --> 03:49.708
And fill me from the crown
to the toe,

03:49.917 --> 03:54.083
top-full of direst cruelty.

03:56.833 --> 03:59.000
A bold interpretation, Alicia.

03:59.208 --> 04:03.417
I can't believe I hooked up with her
during her bi-curious phase.

04:04.583 --> 04:05.542
Molly Maxwell.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.083
Think you can top that?

04:09.500 --> 04:10.875
I have a sore throat.

04:11.083 --> 04:13.708
Come on, Molly, don't do
the boring slacker thing with me.

04:13.917 --> 04:17.375
She's not a slacker, okay?
She has a genius IQ, FYI.

04:17.583 --> 04:22.333
Right. I forgot everyone of Phoenix
is a precious snowflake.

04:22.875 --> 04:25.167
Please just be ready for next time.

04:34.833 --> 04:36.542
I have it in my teeth.

04:40.125 --> 04:42.917
Aw. Yeah, you actually
drew blood that time,

04:43.125 --> 04:45.792
I promise you.
- Well, beauty is pain.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.583
Um... okay, it says
to just put it on your tongue.

04:55.417 --> 04:58.500
Okay... one for you.

05:09.333 --> 05:10.458
Say, "Ah!"

06:08.417 --> 06:10.208
Molly, are you okay?

06:12.833 --> 06:15.750
Hello? Genius.

06:17.833 --> 06:19.875
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and Tomorrow,
creeps in this petty pace from day to day.

06:20.083 --> 06:22.292
To the last syllable of recorded time,
and all our yesterdays have lighted fools

06:22.500 --> 06:25.125
the way to dusty death. Out, out,brief candle.
Lifeâ€™s but a walking shadow,

06:25.333 --> 06:28.042
a poor player, that struts and frets his hour
upon the stage, and then is heard no more.

06:28.250 --> 06:31.333
It is a tale fold by an idiot,
full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.

06:33.792 --> 06:35.792
9.4 seconds.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.292
Wow.

06:49.542 --> 06:51.792
Oh, it's you again.

06:53.375 --> 06:54.833
So, what are you on?

06:56.000 --> 06:58.208
Acid, but I'm not a slacker.

06:59.875 --> 07:01.583
Kids still do acid?

07:08.542 --> 07:11.167
I kinda came out here
to be alone, so...

07:12.833 --> 07:14.792
All right.

07:14.958 --> 07:19.750
What you need to do is find a safe place
to go and enjoy it.

07:21.708 --> 07:25.625
I know right now it might feel
like you're never gonna be normal again,

07:25.833 --> 07:29.125
that you're gonna spend the rest of your life
trapped in some guest bathroom seeing elves

07:29.333 --> 07:33.083
climbing out the wallpaper,
but... you'll come down eventually.

07:49.250 --> 07:52.542
Hi. I'm Ben Carter.
I'm Molly's English teacher.

07:52.750 --> 07:56.292
Evan Maxwell.
She's not in any trouble, is she?

07:57.292 --> 07:59.750
No, just a little bit
too much Red Bull, I think.

08:00.625 --> 08:03.250
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Maxwell.

08:25.625 --> 08:29.042
No sleepover tonight?
- Shit!

08:31.500 --> 08:34.292
What if we've been
permanently altered by this?

08:39.875 --> 08:43.582
I think we should just stay
in this fort forever.

08:43.792 --> 08:45.792
Yeah, let's never leave.

09:13.458 --> 09:16.208
What's the big deal, Raymond?
I have a decent average.

09:16.417 --> 09:20.458
True. But the elective program
is what makes Phoenix so special.

09:21.250 --> 09:23.500
Have you ever thought
that maybe everyone at this school

09:23.708 --> 09:27.792
is a little too special?
- No, I haven't

09:29.875 --> 09:31.500
You know, Molly,

09:31.708 --> 09:34.417
this planet isn't made
for every alien,

09:34.625 --> 09:37.083
but I, for one,
would be very disappointed

09:37.292 --> 09:41.292
if it turned out that regular school
was a better match for you than Phoenix.

09:41.500 --> 09:43.208
No! I'll just...

09:45.292 --> 09:47.500
I'll figure something out
by tomorrow, okay?

09:47.708 --> 09:49.833
Okay
- Okay

09:50.667 --> 09:52.542
That's my favourite star child.

09:53.792 --> 09:55.417
Okay.

09:55.958 --> 09:57.625
What did Raymond want?

09:57.833 --> 10:01.250
Well, you know, I'm just getting
a prodigy of the Year award.

10:02.458 --> 10:06.250
You know, Tafiana Thinks
I have a real shot at this Fairfax school.

10:06.458 --> 10:08.458
Is's almost impossible
to get on audition.

10:08.667 --> 10:10.292
Call me later, okay?

10:13.583 --> 10:15.250
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

10:16.417 --> 10:17.458
Hi.

10:20.208 --> 10:22.916
What are you listening to?
- Paint Thinners.

10:22.917 --> 10:25.250
You heard of them before?
- Yeah.

10:25.458 --> 10:29.667
They're on my dad's label.
Maxwell Music.

10:29.875 --> 10:33.208
Maxwell Music.
That's pretty cool.

10:33.417 --> 10:35.292
Yeah.
- So?

10:35.500 --> 10:37.792
You solve the great
elective conundrum yet?

10:38.000 --> 10:41.667
No, but Raymond has threatened
to kick me out of school

10:41.833 --> 10:44.625
if I don't pick something.
- So pick something.

10:44.833 --> 10:48.458
I can't find the right thing.
- It's just an elective.

10:50.542 --> 10:53.125
All right, well, I saw
you were taking pictures at the dance

10:53.333 --> 10:55.667
before you had that little meltdown.

10:55.875 --> 10:58.458
Maybe you could do something
with that.

10:58.667 --> 11:00.792
They were just stupid pictures
of my friends.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.792
Lorry Wallace got: famous
faking pictures of his friends.

11:04.667 --> 11:06.875
Is if any worse
than painting Unicorns,

11:07.083 --> 11:09.875
or making paper sculptures
and setting them on fire?

11:10.083 --> 11:12.208
What was that class called?
Art Therapy.

11:12.417 --> 11:14.542
I like unicorns.
- Who doesn't?

11:19.375 --> 11:21.625
That way, next to Crack Whore Alley?

11:21.833 --> 11:23.792
Crack whores
are a photographer's dream.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.917
Yeah, okay. See you.
- Hey, alien.

11:28.167 --> 11:31.625
This whole elective thing doesn't have
to be some big life crisis, all right?

11:31.833 --> 11:35.625
Just pick something that you don't hate,
and do it, and get Raymond off your back.

11:35.833 --> 11:37.792
But I have to pick something
I can be great at.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.958
For Christ's sake, you're 16!

11:40.167 --> 11:42.875
You don't have to have a retrospective
at MoMA next year.

11:44.042 --> 11:46.792
It's still just high school,
no matter what Phoenix says.

11:50.292 --> 11:51.750
Good night, Molly.

11:58.250 --> 11:59.917
'Night.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.125
Hey-

12:06.333 --> 12:08.333
I have to meet Caitlin
of the studio,

12:08.542 --> 12:11.832
and your dad has a label thing,
with Heidi, so...

12:11.833 --> 12:15.000
can you watch Aiden for me?
- I can stay by myself!

12:15.875 --> 12:18.875
At school Today,
I saw cm owl barf up a skeleton.

12:19.083 --> 12:21.375
Why do you have owls
at school?

12:21.583 --> 12:23.375
He's something, isn't he?

12:24.917 --> 12:26.458
He's really something.

12:27.583 --> 12:28.792
What?
- Your brother.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.792
Oh, yeah.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.833
Don't get too carried away.

12:33.042 --> 12:36.000
He'll probably end up on meih
working at the 7-Eleven.

12:36.208 --> 12:37.458
Ouch.

12:42.042 --> 12:46.083
What is that?
- It's for my new elective.

12:46.292 --> 12:48.667
I was thinking of photography, maybe.

12:49.708 --> 12:51.042
That's great!

12:51.250 --> 12:53.750
Observing the world
from behind the lens.

12:53.958 --> 12:56.458
I think your dad
has an old film camera here.

12:57.333 --> 13:00.250
Yeah, but everything is
digital now, so...

13:01.708 --> 13:04.458
We can go and see if there are
any workshops at Artscape.

13:04.667 --> 13:05.875
Okay, don't.

13:06.083 --> 13:08.458
Don't ruin it before I start,
so just...

13:10.333 --> 13:11.292
Bye.

13:13.042 --> 13:17.042
There's leftover kale
and quinoca soup. Bye!

13:20.250 --> 13:23.542
Photography! Well, well.

13:24.667 --> 13:27.792
I'd need someone to supervise
on independent study.

13:27.958 --> 13:30.667
Maybe... Ben Carter?

13:30.833 --> 13:32.833
He seems to know a lot
about photography.

13:33.042 --> 13:36.000
Well, Ben's sort of been parachuted
into this madness midyear.

13:36.208 --> 13:37.667
It's a lot to cope with.

13:37.833 --> 13:40.458
But Wendy,
maybe Wendy could do if.

13:41.583 --> 13:44.667
I can't wait to see your warped photos!

13:44.833 --> 13:46.792
Maybe this is the ticket!

13:47.000 --> 13:50.042
Don't have a fit or anything.
- I can if I want.

13:53.917 --> 13:57.292
You guys might recall
that this natural versus unnatural stuff

13:57.500 --> 14:00.417
we also discussed
when we were of Hamlet last month.

14:03.500 --> 14:06.417
Thank you for your undivided attention,
as usual.

14:10.625 --> 14:12.583
So? What makes you think

14:12.792 --> 14:15.125
that teaching photography
to a chronic bailer like you

14:15.333 --> 14:17.167
is how I wcmf to spend my free time?

14:17.375 --> 14:20.667
I've heard you didn't have
anything else to do. It's like charity.

14:21.750 --> 14:24.333
I heard Wendy was gonna do it.
- I'd feel really bad

14:24.542 --> 14:28.083
taking her away from Art Therapy.
It's important work.

14:31.292 --> 14:32.625
I'm sorry, Molly.

14:33.583 --> 14:35.458
I just don't think it's for me.

14:37.583 --> 14:39.792
Really? I thought you'd be into it.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.792
You know, helping with my conspiracy
to beat the system.

14:45.750 --> 14:46.958
Like pirates.

14:47.167 --> 14:49.375
Conspiracy pirates.

14:51.250 --> 14:52.667
Yep.

14:59.875 --> 15:03.750
Your mom's poor local
organic heart will just break.

15:04.875 --> 15:06.417
It's her own fault.

15:06.625 --> 15:10.208
Remember that hardcore super vegan kid
Anthony at your eighth birthday party?

15:10.417 --> 15:13.208
Oh, my God.
He chowed like 10 hotdogs

15:13.417 --> 15:15.750
and then barfed
all over the carpet.

15:17.458 --> 15:20.417
Hey, is that the phone ringing?
I think MoMA's calling.

15:20.625 --> 15:24.000
Thank Larry Wallace
and all his naked people.

15:24.208 --> 15:26.375
Woo naked people
hell yeah

15:26.583 --> 15:30.000
You mean you actually looked him up?
- Who's Larry Wallace?

15:30.208 --> 15:33.167
So, were you suggesting I fake
photos of my naked friends as an elective?

15:33.375 --> 15:35.792
Because I'm prelly sure that's illegal.

15:35.958 --> 15:37.792
Wait, who? the fuck
are you guys talking about?

15:38.000 --> 15:39.917
I didn't even think about that.

15:40.125 --> 15:43.542
Well, I gotta go pick up
my teacher of the Year award, so...

15:43.750 --> 15:44.792
Yeah.

15:47.667 --> 15:49.875
What was that all about?

15:52.833 --> 15:56.458
All right, come with me.
- I'm going to Kensington with Caitlin and Gala.

15:56.667 --> 15:58.417
It'll just take a minute.

16:02.958 --> 16:07.167
Right Well, Raymond
promised me a dark room.

16:10.625 --> 16:11.833
Great.

16:12.042 --> 16:14.000
I think it hasn't been used for years.

16:15.458 --> 16:18.208
Dark room?
- Yes, a dark room.

16:18.417 --> 16:20.958
You know, like for photography
in ancient times?

16:21.750 --> 16:24.208
And what's wrong with digital?
- No, if I'm gonna do this,

16:24.417 --> 16:26.458
Then I'm gonna do it properly.
I'm not a slacker.

16:28.833 --> 16:30.292
Wow.

16:30.500 --> 16:33.958
Well, wasn't the idea
just to get Raymond off my back?

16:34.167 --> 16:36.625
I don't recall saying
that you wouldn't have to do any work,

16:36.833 --> 16:39.417
just that you didn't have
to be the next Diane Arbus.

16:39.625 --> 16:43.250
Right. Diane Arbus.
Love her.

16:43.833 --> 16:45.375
Look her up.

16:45.542 --> 16:47.292
Well, of least we have
a spinning wheel.

16:58.375 --> 17:01.083
No, make your eyes look more dead.

17:01.292 --> 17:03.625
And don't do that with your lips.

17:03.833 --> 17:04.833
Just look bored.

17:05.041 --> 17:07.833
If you don't like how I'm doing if,
then fake pictures of Gala.

17:08.041 --> 17:09.833
Just don't pose so much.

17:10.041 --> 17:11.625
I think you look hot.

17:11.833 --> 17:14.375
Ben was telling me
about this really awesome photographer

17:14.583 --> 17:16.958
who takes pictures
of all kinds of freaks.

17:17.166 --> 17:18.583
I heard that Ben rides
a motorcycle.

17:18.791 --> 17:20.666
I don't think that's true.

17:20.833 --> 17:23.583
But he is in a band.
- Look who's The Ben expert.

17:26.583 --> 17:28.958
Yep, just like that, Gala.

17:36.833 --> 17:40.167
Hey... do you ride o motorcycle?

17:42.250 --> 17:45.458
No. Why? Should I?

17:45.958 --> 17:47.750
I don't know, probably.

17:50.333 --> 17:54.833
Maybe we shouldn't look of this batch.
- You're like a boiling tea ketle.

17:55.833 --> 17:57.916
What does that even mean?

17:57.917 --> 17:59.583
I don't know, actually.

18:02.250 --> 18:03.792
Okay.

18:13.458 --> 18:15.042
All right.

18:15.250 --> 18:16.958
The moment of truth.

18:24.167 --> 18:25.667
Not too shabby.

18:26.458 --> 18:28.458
Of course, they'd be better
it they were in focus

18:28.667 --> 18:31.458
and not overexposed,
but it's not like those are

18:31.667 --> 18:34.417
the basic principles
of photography or anything.

18:36.292 --> 18:37.250
Not bad.

18:41.458 --> 18:44.792
Not one word, Mom.
- Okay, okay, I just think it's great.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.667
That was seven words.

18:50.458 --> 18:52.833
Take my picture.
- Can you turn your body info a pretzel?

18:53.042 --> 18:54.000
I can try.

18:55.125 --> 18:56.625
See? You're a natural.

18:56.833 --> 18:59.000
I think it'll be very cool
to have a photographer

18:59.208 --> 19:00.292
in the family.
- Mom!

19:00.500 --> 19:02.000
Just saying.
- You'll want to cut down

19:02.208 --> 19:04.958
on the practice there, monkey.
Your body's starting to look weird.

19:06.500 --> 19:08.917
Wanna come see Heidi Slater?
- Yeah!

19:09.125 --> 19:10.625
See ya.

19:22.708 --> 19:23.958
Isn't she something?

19:46.542 --> 19:49.833
What are you doing here?
- My dad's over there.

19:50.833 --> 19:53.333
She's gonna be the next Feisf, apparently.
- Oh, thank God for that.

19:53.542 --> 19:54.917
We need a new one.

19:57.208 --> 19:59.250
Do you think your dad
could introduce us?

20:01.667 --> 20:04.583
And you could do your English homework
of the bar while you wait.

20:12.917 --> 20:15.625
I actually have some work to do
in the dark room.

20:15.833 --> 20:18.708
Dude, I scored some pot cookies.

20:18.917 --> 20:21.167
It's not exactly how I want
to spend the afternoon either,

20:21.375 --> 20:22.958
but I have to pass.

20:23.167 --> 20:26.458
Save me a cookie!
- Lame! You're lame!

20:26.667 --> 20:28.583
Favourite food?

20:28.792 --> 20:30.292
Sushi

20:32.583 --> 20:34.792
Very sophisticated.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.583
Yeah.

20:36.792 --> 20:38.792
What's your real favourite food?

20:39.000 --> 20:40.125
Sushi

20:41.042 --> 20:43.583
What's your real favourite f--
- Okay, nachos!

20:44.875 --> 20:46.583
That's what I thought.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.375
Keep doing that.

20:52.583 --> 20:53.875
Favourite place.

20:55.792 --> 20:57.458
The island, probably.

20:58.667 --> 21:00.083
That's specific.

21:01.083 --> 21:03.083
Toronto Island.
You don't know?

21:03.292 --> 21:06.292
It's just across the lake,
but it's like another planet.

21:06.500 --> 21:09.458
Raymond must love that.
- You know it.

21:11.292 --> 21:13.667
There's a lot of great stuff there, like...

21:15.167 --> 21:16.875
A lame amusement park.

21:17.083 --> 21:19.458
I love lame amusement parks.
- Yeah.

21:20.708 --> 21:23.875
We should go there on a field Trip.
I'm tired of taking photos of my friends.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.667
I'm tired of your friends.

21:29.708 --> 21:33.083
And there's a lot of little cottages,
and no cars,

21:34.083 --> 21:35.875
and beaches,

21:36.083 --> 21:37.832
and a ferry.

21:37.833 --> 21:39.832
I love ferries.

21:39.833 --> 21:41.417
Who doesn't?

21:43.500 --> 21:45.542
We should just go there right now.

21:46.500 --> 21:49.833
Yeah... probably not kosher.

21:50.042 --> 21:51.875
It's for the good of my art.

21:52.083 --> 21:55.083
You'd be saving me
from my fated Starbucks.

21:55.292 --> 21:59.000
It's not even really a big deal.

22:02.833 --> 22:05.667
I didn't realize
you were such a conformist.

22:29.875 --> 22:32.250
So, what's your favourite band?
- I'm not telling you that.

22:35.667 --> 22:37.667
No, you'll just totally judge me.

22:37.875 --> 22:39.792
As if. Come on, who is if?

22:41.542 --> 22:43.292
Probably...

22:43.500 --> 22:45.375
The Ghost Buttons.

22:46.208 --> 22:50.167
That's a mode-up name, isn't it?
So, what happened to your band?

22:50.375 --> 22:52.000
How'd you know I was in a band?

22:53.542 --> 22:54.708
Google.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.375
Googled me, huh?

22:59.833 --> 23:01.583
Boring story.

23:01.792 --> 23:05.042
The industry's just terrible these days.
- That sucks.

23:06.167 --> 23:09.542
Yeah, I wish I could import that
to the fabulous students of Phoenix.

23:09.750 --> 23:12.625
You can be as wonderful and talented

23:12.833 --> 23:14.708
and unique as you like, but...

23:14.917 --> 23:16.708
if doesn't mean
your dream's gonna come true

23:16.917 --> 23:18.792
just 'cause everybody says
you can do whatever you want.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.792
Raymond would spontaneously combust.

23:23.667 --> 23:26.458
Maybe you just weren't that good.
- Probably.

23:27.833 --> 23:31.125
Anyway, teaching is a noble profession.

23:32.667 --> 23:35.083
I guess you could always play
guitar in the subway for change

23:35.292 --> 23:36.625
if that doesn't work out.

23:36.833 --> 23:39.083
Yeah, you could drop an elective
so you'll be right there with rne.

23:39.292 --> 23:41.042
Not me. Haven't you heard?

23:41.250 --> 23:43.417
I have the IQ of a genius.

23:43.625 --> 23:45.458
They probably just added up
the scores wrong.

24:20.542 --> 24:21.792
You know, this place...

24:23.500 --> 24:24.708
it's not half bad.

24:34.250 --> 24:37.917
Oh, my God, no.
Do not bother. Waste of film.

24:56.833 --> 24:57.792
Okay.

25:39.500 --> 25:41.958
You probably shouldn't develop those.

25:57.958 --> 25:59.625
She's going to Parkdale.

26:18.792 --> 26:21.167
There wasn't a phone anywhere.
- Well, maybe...

26:21.375 --> 26:24.833
you should've called before you went
to the island alone in the dark.

26:25.042 --> 26:27.708
Hey, Aiden.
Jesus, enough already. Go to bed!

26:27.875 --> 26:29.708
It wasn't dark when I went,

26:29.917 --> 26:33.042
and... if I had a cellphone, this...

26:33.250 --> 26:34.833
wouldn't be an issue.
- I expect more from you.

26:35.042 --> 26:36.832
Why?
- Well, maybe it is time

26:36.833 --> 26:39.667
we got her a cellphone.
- Daddy...

26:43.208 --> 26:44.167
Molly...

26:46.125 --> 26:47.542
don't make plans for a while.

26:47.750 --> 26:49.042
Whoa, what?

26:50.375 --> 26:53.042
Since when are you,
like, an authoritarian?

27:13.750 --> 27:16.333
What? When?
- Shut the front door.

27:16.542 --> 27:18.875
I'm really sorry. Fucking streetcar.
I actually waited for three full ones

27:19.083 --> 27:21.458
to go by, and tell me you haven't read
Savage Love yet.

27:21.667 --> 27:23.042
We were waiting for you, duh.

27:24.500 --> 27:25.625
Where were you yesterday?

27:26.292 --> 27:28.333
Gala broke up with Andy.
- What? Why?

27:28.542 --> 27:32.333
I thought you were obsessed with her.
- She was just such a girl, it was annoying.

27:32.542 --> 27:34.083
So, where were you?

27:35.333 --> 27:37.333
I actually went to the island
to fake some pictures.

27:37.542 --> 27:39.083
But with who?

27:41.208 --> 27:43.792
No one.
- You went by yourself?

27:45.542 --> 27:47.333
Okay, well, actually--
- I can't believe

27:47.542 --> 27:49.417
you ditched us to be a loner.

27:51.583 --> 27:53.792
Well, I did get grounded.
Can you believe that?

27:53.958 --> 27:57.167
Marilyn grounded you?
- What about the Egg Castles show?

27:58.833 --> 28:02.167
You know, maybe we wouldn't be in this mess
if you'd just come over.

28:02.625 --> 28:04.167
Come on, sit.

28:08.292 --> 28:10.292
"Relax and you'll squirt."

28:11.417 --> 28:12.333
What?

28:20.167 --> 28:22.542
How's Ben working out?
- Photography?

28:22.750 --> 28:24.542
Yeah.
- Yeah, I really like it.

28:24.750 --> 28:28.000
Oh, beautiful. We need someone
to document the crazy energy

28:28.208 --> 28:29.833
happening around here these days.

28:31.208 --> 28:32.167
That's me.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.125
The media is filled
with negative gender stereotypes.

28:39.333 --> 28:42.333
For example, women are expected
to be small and graceful,

28:42.542 --> 28:44.583
while men are expected
to be fall and broad--

28:44.792 --> 28:47.833
You guys did it here in town?
- Hey.

28:48.042 --> 28:50.667
When are we gonna meet again?
I developed two rolls but I don't--

28:50.833 --> 28:52.792
Yep, I'll get back to you on that,
Molly.

28:52.958 --> 28:55.250
If you'd just fake your seat
You're a little bit late.

29:03.167 --> 29:05.125
Yo, who's the babe?

29:05.333 --> 29:06.832
...I'll interduce you, and just...
- Yeah.

29:06.833 --> 29:07.792
Okay.

29:09.958 --> 29:12.750
All right, so I've got something
really cool for you guys today.

29:12.958 --> 29:16.458
This is Jordon Dunhill.
She's a filmmaker, here, in Toronto,

29:16.667 --> 29:19.375
and she's gonna show us
her ultra-modern take on Macbeth.

29:20.083 --> 29:22.625
Trust me, you guys
have never seen Macbeth quite like this.

29:23.500 --> 29:24.625
Thanks, Ben.

29:25.583 --> 29:28.125
You're pretty lucky
to have this guy as your teacher.

29:29.292 --> 29:30.792
Now, it's a bit shocking in parts.

29:30.958 --> 29:35.000
For example, Macbeth is played
by Marian Smithley, a woman.

29:37.667 --> 29:40.458
Hey there. How was your day?

29:40.667 --> 29:43.667
Fine.
- Just fine?

29:44.583 --> 29:46.667
No, Mom, it was the best day of my life!

30:10.958 --> 30:12.625
Can I go to this talent night thing?

30:12.833 --> 30:14.333
That sounds like torture.

30:22.042 --> 30:24.583
It's a school... Yeah.
It's a s-school activity,

30:24.792 --> 30:26.292
so yeah, yeah, I guess so.

30:26.917 --> 30:29.250
So that means she can come
to the Egg Castles, huh?

30:30.208 --> 30:31.125
Well, no, she's grounded.

30:31.333 --> 30:32.375
But you just said I could go
to talent night.

30:32.583 --> 30:34.916
Because that's different;
it's not a concert.

30:34.917 --> 30:37.833
Egg Castles are way more talented
than anyone at my school.

30:46.167 --> 30:47.458
I gotta go.

31:10.750 --> 31:13.125
I know that you need
your privacy more these days--

31:13.333 --> 31:14.458
Mom.

31:16.167 --> 31:18.667
How many of these tolks
do we really have to have?

31:18.833 --> 31:21.208
Well, I was prelly clueless
about my own sexuality

31:21.417 --> 31:24.792
for a very long time,
which affected my self-esteem,

31:25.000 --> 31:28.125
which led to bad decisions, and--
- Like what?

31:30.250 --> 31:32.042
And that's another conversation.

31:34.167 --> 31:36.500
You may not want to talk to me
about anything.

31:37.458 --> 31:38.458
But"...

31:39.833 --> 31:42.916
we're going to planned Parenthood,
and you're going to get the pill,

31:42.917 --> 31:45.000
or the ring... Actually,
there's a lot of options out there now,

31:45.208 --> 31:48.000
and you can just talk to the doctor about it.
- I'm no': having sex.

31:48.208 --> 31:49.792
You're acting different.

31:52.042 --> 31:55.208
Anything you wont to talk to me about?
- No.

31:59.708 --> 32:00.917
Maybe this will help.

32:02.625 --> 32:04.208
Dinner's almost ready.

32:18.458 --> 32:20.958
Oh, God. Really?

32:26.083 --> 32:27.167
You're in for a treat.

32:29.917 --> 32:32.125
Just kidding.
It's gonna be really uncomfortable.

32:32.333 --> 32:34.125
So, you want to go on birth control?

32:34.333 --> 32:37.333
My mom wants me to,
even though I'm not!

32:38.083 --> 32:40.292
...you know, having sex.

32:40.500 --> 32:42.833
Do you have a boyfriend?
- I like someone.

32:43.042 --> 32:47.292
But... it's compli...
it's complicated.

32:47.500 --> 32:49.625
Well, I can prescribe you
birth control,

32:49.833 --> 32:51.792
but if doesn't mean you have to go have sex
all over the place.

32:51.958 --> 32:54.667
I'll try not to have sex
all over the place.

32:57.417 --> 32:59.792
Well, I mean, what would you do?

33:00.000 --> 33:02.083
Would you fell him you like him,
or what?

33:02.833 --> 33:04.792
Well, I'm prefiy straight forward,

33:05.000 --> 33:07.125
so... I'd probably
let him know somehow.

34:05.417 --> 34:07.250
You printed photos.

34:12.417 --> 34:13.917
So, how are you doing?

34:14.458 --> 34:15.417
Good.

34:16.667 --> 34:17.625
Great.

34:19.750 --> 34:21.333
How's Jordan?

34:22.833 --> 34:23.792
Jordan?

34:26.500 --> 34:27.583
Yeah.

34:28.375 --> 34:31.458
She seems... interesting.

34:34.417 --> 34:36.125
Yeah, you would think that, right?

34:36.333 --> 34:39.500
I mean, her parents are actually,
like, carnies from the circus,

34:39.708 --> 34:41.750
but she is extremely dull.

34:42.542 --> 34:44.083
It's the weirdest thing.

34:49.167 --> 34:51.458
You know how to make
your contact sheet yet?

35:07.667 --> 35:10.417
So, Caitlin made me...

35:10.625 --> 35:14.667
promise to check out
that ridiculous talent night.

35:14.833 --> 35:16.458
I thought I'd take some photos.

35:17.833 --> 35:21.042
So many precious snowflakes
in one room.

35:22.083 --> 35:24.125
It's like a blizzard.

35:46.583 --> 35:47.792
Wow!

35:48.917 --> 35:51.750
So, who's next?
- Ben should play something.

35:51.958 --> 35:54.667
No, Molly, I think this is
a student talent night,

35:54.833 --> 35:56.667
so maybe you should
demonstrate your skills.

35:56.833 --> 35:59.625
Yeah, but photography
doesn't translate to the stage, so...

35:59.833 --> 36:03.792
Come on, Ben! Don't be lame.
- Yeah, come on, Ben. Don't be lame.

36:07.542 --> 36:08.708
Go, Ben!

36:11.083 --> 36:14.875
Okay, well, I should probably
apologize in advance.

36:16.083 --> 36:18.042
Here's a song
by some city mates of yours.

37:01.750 --> 37:04.500
Okay, now he is sexy.

37:04.708 --> 37:06.208
Maybe I should go for it.

37:28.083 --> 37:29.667
I'm not gonna lie to you.

37:29.833 --> 37:33.792
It was a great show.
- This is the worst Easter ever.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.042
Well, of least your sentence is over.

37:36.250 --> 37:38.500
Hey, I had a drink
with your English teacher last night.

37:38.708 --> 37:40.792
You had a drink with Ben?
- He's young, huh?

37:41.000 --> 37:42.958
You kids must eat him for breakfast.

37:43.167 --> 37:45.542
What did you guys talk about?
- Oh, you know,

37:45.750 --> 37:49.625
how shit the music industry is, the usual.
Seems like a good guy, though.

37:51.167 --> 37:53.333
Did he mention me?
- Yeah.

37:53.542 --> 37:55.208
He said you are super cool.

37:56.417 --> 37:57.375
Really?

37:58.667 --> 37:59.875
Anything else?

38:00.083 --> 38:03.458
Well, I don't remember the entire
conversation verbatim, Molly.

38:03.667 --> 38:05.917
Oh, your mom wants you downstairs
for the hunt.

38:07.458 --> 38:08.583
Seriously?

38:23.833 --> 38:26.333
'Morning, honey.
- Good morning.

38:44.417 --> 38:46.625
You gonna open up your clues?

38:48.000 --> 38:49.792
Don't you think I'm too old for this?

38:51.208 --> 38:53.417
You might wont to look in the tub.

38:59.833 --> 39:02.958
No! An iPhone?
ls it for me?

39:03.167 --> 39:04.667
I love you!

39:05.750 --> 39:07.792
I want an iPhone!
That's not fair.

39:08.750 --> 39:10.792
Who are you gonna call?
Mozart?

39:10.958 --> 39:14.667
I don't think he has a cell.
Go get your Lego. Go play.

39:22.875 --> 39:27.417
I'm gonna go meet Gala and Caitlin.
Will you tell Mom so she doesn't spaz out?

39:27.625 --> 39:28.750
What about me spazzing out?

39:30.167 --> 39:31.833
I'm gonna go meet Gala
and Caitlin, okay?

39:32.042 --> 39:35.042
Sure. You want a ride?
I'm going to pick up a cellphone for Aiden.

39:35.833 --> 39:37.042
Yep, and next Easter,

39:37.250 --> 39:39.792
we can do firearms all around.
Might be tricky to hide, though.

39:41.667 --> 39:44.625
You look really nice.
Say hi to the girls for me. Okay?

39:44.833 --> 39:46.667
Okay
- Okay

39:51.833 --> 39:52.917
You look amazing.

39:55.708 --> 39:58.125
Wow. All grown up.

39:59.125 --> 40:01.083
A'ight. See ya.

40:32.625 --> 40:33.583
Hi.

40:34.542 --> 40:37.250
Hey. I, um...

40:39.167 --> 40:41.708
I just wanted to...
drop this off for you.

40:41.917 --> 40:44.542
I didn't... think you'd be home.

40:45.042 --> 40:48.917
Was gonna put if in your... mailbox?

41:06.875 --> 41:07.958
I love this guy.

41:11.833 --> 41:13.667
I actually have something for you too.

41:14.958 --> 41:16.208
Just wait there one sec.

41:28.833 --> 41:31.000
I was going to give These
to you at school.

41:31.208 --> 41:33.583
I borrowed Them
from an artist friend of mine.

41:40.917 --> 41:45.042
Wow. Was it Jordan?
-Yeah.

41:45.250 --> 41:47.167
So they're probably boring.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.042
You can probably come in for a sec.

42:01.292 --> 42:02.458
Okay.

42:15.583 --> 42:17.292
Cool place.

42:21.250 --> 42:22.708
Sure, sit down.

42:24.792 --> 42:25.917
Okay.

42:31.583 --> 42:33.500
I love these.

42:36.167 --> 42:37.750
So, you're having a good Easter?

42:39.458 --> 42:42.708
Yes. Daddy gave me an iPhone.

42:42.917 --> 42:45.958
Great. Now you're gonna become
one of those texting demons.

42:59.625 --> 43:01.208
I ran into your dad again.

43:02.500 --> 43:05.625
I heard. How was that?

43:06.417 --> 43:09.208
A bit bizarre,
to tell you the truth.

43:09.375 --> 43:10.708
Why?

43:14.833 --> 43:16.042
No reason at all.

44:06.958 --> 44:09.750
You know, Molly,
I actually have to get going pretty quick.

44:09.958 --> 44:12.750
Yeah, me too.
I'm... meeting the girls.

44:16.083 --> 44:18.833
So you were wallowing here in self-pity.

44:20.542 --> 44:21.583
Yeah.

44:22.833 --> 44:25.458
Drowning in scotch, actually.

44:25.667 --> 44:27.875
So it's good I came by, then.

44:31.625 --> 44:34.000
Yeah, you're a real godsend.

46:49.167 --> 46:50.500
Hey. I am so sorry.

46:50.708 --> 46:53.333
I got into a huge tight with my mom,
and I got held up.

46:54.125 --> 46:55.250
So...

46:56.500 --> 46:58.625
We talked to your mom.
She said you were with us.

46:58.833 --> 47:01.792
So, where were you?
We were gonna leave without you.

47:03.083 --> 47:06.250
Well... I met a guy
at the streetcar...

47:07.000 --> 47:09.208
at the streetcar stop, and...

47:09.417 --> 47:13.458
we got to talking and,
you know... walking around.

47:14.042 --> 47:17.250
I didn't even realize my ringer was off.

47:21.292 --> 47:22.500
Who is he?

47:24.583 --> 47:27.583
His name's Spencer,
and... he goes to Parkdale.

47:28.417 --> 47:29.792
Okay, what's he like?

47:32.875 --> 47:34.167
He plays the trumpet

47:34.375 --> 47:36.375
Ooh, a musician.

47:37.500 --> 47:38.792
Like it?
- Yeah.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.917
Tell me, tell me.
- He's in the gifted program.

47:42.125 --> 47:43.917
He's gifted?
- Yep.

47:44.125 --> 47:45.417
That's really great.

47:47.458 --> 47:48.667
Well, you should invite him over.

47:48.875 --> 47:51.250
Thai would probably, um...

47:51.458 --> 47:53.250
end things pretty...

47:53.458 --> 47:55.708
pretty quick.
- Yeah.

47:56.042 --> 47:57.083
Yeah, I see your point.

47:57.458 --> 47:58.542
Oh, my God!

48:46.917 --> 48:48.500
Breakfast burrito?

48:50.500 --> 48:53.125
No Thanks.
- Really?

49:13.500 --> 49:14.458
Hi.

49:16.167 --> 49:17.125
Hello.

49:28.542 --> 49:30.792
Oh, no. Did I just ruin a print?

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
It's fine. I think I ruined that myself.
- No, no, you're killing it.

49:35.167 --> 49:36.125
Wow.

49:37.708 --> 49:40.917
Your brother is a remarkably flexible
young man.

49:46.667 --> 49:47.792
Are you okay?

49:50.000 --> 49:51.542
I'm totally okay.

49:53.667 --> 49:55.333
Are you okay?

49:55.542 --> 49:59.125
I'm... scared shitless,
to be honest.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.042
Rigth...

50:02.083 --> 50:03.250
Sorry.

50:04.250 --> 50:06.708
You're something else,
Molly Maxwell.

50:07.583 --> 50:09.208
Is that a good thing?

50:09.417 --> 50:12.917
No.
You're like a hand grenade.

50:16.292 --> 50:17.792
All right, well...

50:19.292 --> 50:21.000
keep up the good work, yeah?

50:28.000 --> 50:30.750
If you want, you can...
come over later.

50:41.625 --> 50:45.583
You're coming over, right?
- I can't. I'm meeting Spencer.

50:45.792 --> 50:47.875
When do we get to meet this guy?

50:48.083 --> 50:49.208
Soon.

50:51.833 --> 50:54.125
Do you have a date with that new girl yet?

50:55.250 --> 50:57.375
Yeah, but I'm not sure she's my type.

51:00.167 --> 51:02.375
You should take a photo of him
and send it to us.

51:03.958 --> 51:05.458
I'll try.

51:11.375 --> 51:14.500
I'm pretty sure it's colder
in your apartment than it is outside.

51:14.708 --> 51:17.917
An iglo would be warmer.
- Yeah, you're probably right.

51:18.125 --> 51:22.583
Iglos are amazing because
the snow insulates them

51:22.792 --> 51:24.792
and then your body heat
warms them up.

51:26.333 --> 51:28.167
Is that so?
- Yes.

51:29.458 --> 51:32.875
Well, it's also a fact people are warmer
without their clothes on,

51:33.333 --> 51:35.000
in a sleeping bag, or...

51:36.500 --> 51:37.667
a duvet.

51:39.667 --> 51:41.458
That's a fact, is it?

51:49.833 --> 51:51.875
You have some photographs
to show me?

51:53.542 --> 51:56.792
What?
- I-I'd love to see some of your photos.

51:59.875 --> 52:00.958
Sure.

52:47.667 --> 52:48.625
Yeah...

52:52.667 --> 52:54.583
This one's lovely.

52:56.667 --> 52:58.458
Did you have to burn in this corner?

52:59.375 --> 53:03.083
Yep. Dodged a bit there too.

53:04.000 --> 53:07.833
Wow. Burning and dodging.
- I know.

53:09.417 --> 53:11.292
Your mom looks ecstatic.

53:14.208 --> 53:18.792
You don't really want to spend
The afternoon looking ot photos of my mom.

53:38.792 --> 53:40.500
Clothing stays on.

53:41.750 --> 53:42.792
Okay.

53:53.875 --> 53:56.625
And then I said, "Richard,
you can't possibly go in there.

53:56.833 --> 53:58.875
I already gave him
seven bananas!"

53:59.583 --> 54:00.708
Not bad.

54:03.667 --> 54:05.292
I don't want to go.

54:05.500 --> 54:08.458
So just...
You should stay.

54:10.000 --> 54:13.000
At least until the search party finds me.
-Yeah.

54:14.375 --> 54:17.000
I could build a little dungeon
for you somewhere.

54:18.417 --> 54:19.792
That was too far.

54:22.792 --> 54:24.917
I'd just need a trickle of daylight.

54:55.583 --> 54:58.000
He's not even stopping
to eat anymore?

54:58.208 --> 55:01.000
He did. Saves a lot of time
when you don't chew.

55:01.208 --> 55:05.125
Sit. Come on.
Tell me all about your date with Spencer.

55:05.333 --> 55:07.083
I'm really tired.
I'm just gonna go to my room.

55:07.292 --> 55:09.250
You want me
to get this developed?

55:09.875 --> 55:11.250
What? No.

55:11.458 --> 55:13.167
Don't go through my stuff.

55:13.375 --> 55:14.792
Clean your own sheets then.

55:18.542 --> 55:20.333
It could be cool, I guess.

55:20.542 --> 55:23.667
Maybe they'll be more inspired
if it's something that they can relate to.

55:23.875 --> 55:26.458
I mean, if you made the assignment
info an iPhone app,

55:26.667 --> 55:28.042
then maybe you'd have something.

55:29.833 --> 55:32.792
You turned me into a precious snowflake.
Isn't that enough?

55:33.000 --> 55:35.208
Right. Maybe I should use
that stellar technique

55:35.417 --> 55:37.042
with the rest of the class.

55:38.167 --> 55:39.750
Shit, gotta go.

55:40.708 --> 55:42.958
Hey. Who you talking to?

55:44.208 --> 55:45.708
Aunt Suzy.

55:46.208 --> 55:49.792
Oh. Want to go to a secret
Joel Plasketi concert?

55:50.667 --> 55:52.792
I'm not really
into Joel Plasketi that much.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.250
No? I thought you were.

55:56.333 --> 55:57.833
We could have a Guitar Hero marathon.

55:58.708 --> 56:01.458
I kind of have a ton
of homework, so...

56:02.583 --> 56:03.667
Okay.

56:13.167 --> 56:14.125
Hey-

56:19.333 --> 56:20.625
Okay.

56:20.833 --> 56:22.833
Today, we're going to be starting
our poetry unit.

56:24.750 --> 56:27.916
So, M, you get a boyfriend,
and you just decide to peace out?

56:27.917 --> 56:30.125
No, I've just been really busy
with photo.

56:30.333 --> 56:32.167
But all of you guys
actually listen to poetry

56:32.375 --> 56:34.125
every single day in a sense...

56:34.958 --> 56:35.958
on your iPods.

56:36.167 --> 56:38.750
So, we're going to start
this unit by looking at songs

56:38.958 --> 56:41.542
as modern-day poetry,
then we're gonna write our own.

56:41.750 --> 56:44.042
What are some of your favourite songs?
- Lady Gaga.

56:44.250 --> 56:47.458
The Wordsworth of pop.
- This is so lame.

56:47.667 --> 56:51.083
Great Anybody else?
- I like The Zombies.

56:51.292 --> 56:52.250
Starr?

56:52.458 --> 56:55.792
Very nice to see you awake.
Any song in particular?

56:56.708 --> 56:58.500
I don't know the names
of the songs.

57:00.208 --> 57:03.625
Okay. Well...
- So, have you guys done if yet?

57:04.417 --> 57:05.417
No!

57:07.125 --> 57:08.667
Told you so.

57:08.875 --> 57:11.417
Yeah, pick a song,
write down the lyrics,

57:11.625 --> 57:13.083
we'll meet back here
and discuss it.

57:13.833 --> 57:15.000
Okay?

57:51.125 --> 57:52.500
Holy shit!

57:57.500 --> 57:59.750
So, did you get out
to the Tiger Rod show last night?

57:59.958 --> 58:02.375
No. I had a stack of papers to grade.

58:02.583 --> 58:04.167
Oh, that's a shame.
It was epic.

58:04.375 --> 58:06.458
Dad, you're too old to say "epic".

58:06.667 --> 58:09.167
Oh, look who's too cool
for her dad now, huh?

58:09.875 --> 58:11.042
Please don't embarrass yourself.

58:16.333 --> 58:18.792
So, Ben...

58:21.625 --> 58:23.042
Well...

58:23.250 --> 58:25.375
Molly's... assignments

58:25.583 --> 58:28.792
and her class attendance
have been much more consistent.

58:30.083 --> 58:31.542
Good. That's great.

58:33.375 --> 58:36.417
Yeah, and her independent study
is going brilliantly.

58:36.625 --> 58:39.708
She's printing her own photographs
in the dark room already.

58:39.917 --> 58:42.000
Photos? Tic-Toe,
why didn't you tell me?

58:43.333 --> 58:44.792
Show Them your photographs, Molly.

58:44.958 --> 58:45.917
Yeah.

58:56.958 --> 58:58.375
Molly...

58:58.583 --> 59:00.250
These are so good.

59:03.500 --> 59:05.917
Oh, yeah. That one's great.
You should be doing my band photos.

59:06.125 --> 59:07.250
Maybe we should just get you

59:07.458 --> 59:09.542
info a summer camp--
- Okay, can we please go?

59:13.375 --> 59:16.833
Couldn't you have pretended to be sick
or something? I mean, for Christ's sake.

59:17.042 --> 59:21.292
I tried. I'd have to be on my deathbed
for her to miss a conference.

59:21.500 --> 59:24.500
All right, right now,
where are you supposed to be?

59:24.708 --> 59:26.417
Homework at Alice.

59:30.958 --> 59:32.333
Seriously?

59:44.708 --> 59:47.708
So, you think your parents
will accept me into the family now?

59:47.917 --> 59:50.292
My dad wants to marry you himself.

59:54.250 --> 59:57.333
You know, 200 years ago,

59:57.500 --> 59:59.792
no one would have any problem

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.417
if I took you as my child bride.

01:00:04.833 --> 01:00:08.458
Cleopatra was, like,
ruling Egypt when she was my age.

01:00:08.667 --> 01:00:11.042
Is that even true?
- Yeah.

01:00:16.542 --> 01:00:18.458
I think you'd make a great pharaoh.

01:00:33.625 --> 01:00:36.125
Hey. Clothing stays on.

01:00:37.833 --> 01:00:39.417
I'm not taking them off.

01:01:00.458 --> 01:01:01.417
What?

01:01:03.542 --> 01:01:05.333
Wh-what?

01:01:06.375 --> 01:01:08.417
I don't know what I'm doing!

01:01:15.667 --> 01:01:16.750
Stop!

01:01:18.583 --> 01:01:20.375
How's Spencer?

01:01:20.583 --> 01:01:23.958
He's good. I think he's winning
some trumpet awards.

01:01:24.708 --> 01:01:26.625
I should...
- Are you hearing from Fairfax?

01:01:26.833 --> 01:01:29.125
Any day now.
- God, it's excruciating.

01:01:30.583 --> 01:01:33.250
Hey, Ben,
where are your pyjamas?

01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:39.708
Oh, I forgot all about it.

01:01:42.292 --> 01:01:43.583
Shit...

01:01:48.625 --> 01:01:50.042
By the wow-

01:02:01.458 --> 01:02:02.750
Hey-

01:02:02.958 --> 01:02:05.667
I got the prerelease
of the new Ghost Buttons.

01:02:05.833 --> 01:02:07.958
Can you take your seat,
please, Molly, so we can start'?

01:02:11.958 --> 01:02:16.125
All right, so, I Thought we could read
a few of your songs today.

01:02:17.833 --> 01:02:19.833
Anybody like to go first?
- Me!

01:02:26.708 --> 01:02:29.417
I dreamt I carved your initials
into my heart.

01:02:30.458 --> 01:02:34.208
With each beat, they grew
and warped like a tree over the years.

01:02:35.792 --> 01:02:38.083
I dreamed I carved your initials
into my heart.

01:02:39.833 --> 01:02:41.583
With each beat--
- Molly.

01:02:41.792 --> 01:02:45.792
How long have you been in yhis class?
Now you're gonna fuck around on your phone?

01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:48.167
Go see Raymond.
- Why?

01:02:48.375 --> 01:02:51.583
Because you're blatantly disrespecfing me--
- Well, you're being an asshole.

01:02:53.417 --> 01:02:54.417
Get out.

01:02:58.458 --> 01:03:00.375
What do you want me
to tell him, Mr. Carter?

01:03:00.583 --> 01:03:02.500
You can fell him you're acting
like a spoiled brat.

01:03:06.917 --> 01:03:08.417
He's crazy.

01:03:11.042 --> 01:03:13.750
Are your moons out of orbit today
or something?

01:03:13.958 --> 01:03:16.833
Ask Ben. He just freaked out on me
for no reason.

01:03:17.042 --> 01:03:19.958
Your call is important to us.
Please hold.

01:03:22.375 --> 01:03:24.292
Well, what do you think you did?

01:03:25.833 --> 01:03:27.167
I don't even know.

01:04:03.292 --> 01:04:04.500
Hey, Ben...

01:04:21.583 --> 01:04:23.375
Hey! I'm drawing here!
- I'm surprised

01:04:23.583 --> 01:04:26.042
you're allowed to do anything else
with your precious hands.

01:04:28.625 --> 01:04:30.375
Mom! Mom!

01:04:30.583 --> 01:04:32.583
Jesus. What?

01:04:32.792 --> 01:04:34.750
Molly broke my pencil!
- He threw it at me!

01:04:34.958 --> 01:04:38.042
Could've taken my eye out!
- God, Molly. You've been home

01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:39.792
for, what, two minutes?

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.042
You always take his side!
- You were supposed

01:04:42.250 --> 01:04:44.833
to pick up Aiden from piano.
He waited an hour

01:04:45.042 --> 01:04:47.583
before they called me.
- Isn't he old enough to get him a cellphone?

01:04:47.792 --> 01:04:49.542
You're really acting
like a spoiled brol lately.

01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:50.750
You're becoming a total bitch.

01:04:50.958 --> 01:04:53.792
I'm literally gonna punch you
in the face if you don't leave now.

01:05:40.417 --> 01:05:42.792
Right, I'll show you, I'll start.

01:06:01.667 --> 01:06:02.958
Hi.

01:06:13.583 --> 01:06:14.625
Guess what?

01:06:15.792 --> 01:06:18.417
Alicia cast a sex spell on me today.

01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:21.500
Left a note on my desk.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.792
Is if working?

01:06:25.958 --> 01:06:27.167
I don't know yet.

01:06:28.625 --> 01:06:31.250
Do you think I... seem different?

01:06:32.458 --> 01:06:33.500
You're a jerk.

01:06:36.667 --> 01:06:41.458
Look, just... never wear pigtails
ever again.

01:06:42.958 --> 01:06:44.375
Promise me.

01:06:45.583 --> 01:06:46.875
Yeah.

01:06:52.042 --> 01:06:53.583
Hey, Raymond.
- Hi.

01:06:55.458 --> 01:06:58.000
Wow. Look of all your photos.

01:07:01.833 --> 01:07:03.125
This is interesting.

01:07:09.208 --> 01:07:11.333
Ben, can I have a word
with you in my office

01:07:11.542 --> 01:07:15.042
when you're done here?
- I can come right now.

01:07:24.708 --> 01:07:26.458
Great work, Molly.

01:07:41.542 --> 01:07:43.917
Raymond was asking questions
about us.

01:07:44.125 --> 01:07:46.042
He sent me home.
- What? Why?

01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:48.125
What did he say?
- He was asking about the fight

01:07:48.333 --> 01:07:49.792
and why we're spending
so much time together.

01:07:49.958 --> 01:07:52.125
You're my photo advisor.

01:07:53.875 --> 01:07:55.292
I could go to jail, Molly.

01:07:57.208 --> 01:07:59.125
I'm above age in Canada.
I looked it up.

01:07:59.333 --> 01:08:01.208
Not if I'm your teacher.

01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:06.875
Look...

01:08:08.667 --> 01:08:11.542
Well, don't be surprised
if Raymond wants to talk to you as well.

01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:14.167
Fuck me, he's gonna call your parents.

01:08:16.832 --> 01:08:19.417
I'll just fell them you're my new talent.
- Molly...

01:08:20.750 --> 01:08:22.125
This is not funny.

01:08:27.332 --> 01:08:28.457
But...

01:08:28.667 --> 01:08:30.875
I can still come over, right?

01:08:34.042 --> 01:08:35.957
I don't think so.

01:08:39.042 --> 01:08:41.750
And I'm gonna need you
to clear out your phone as well.

01:08:44.832 --> 01:08:47.917
If that's what you want.
I don't want to get you in trouble.

01:09:48.582 --> 01:09:49.875
Let's do it.

01:09:55.542 --> 01:09:58.458
Come on.
What if this is our last chance?

01:09:59.292 --> 01:10:02.167
Would you rather I lose it to some asshole
after a bunch of beer bongs?

01:10:02.375 --> 01:10:04.417
Is that really the only other option?

01:10:05.583 --> 01:10:06.958
Probably.

01:10:18.583 --> 01:10:20.458
It just feels wrong.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.167
I don't see the difference
between this and the other stuff.

01:10:26.375 --> 01:10:28.750
Well, you might
when you're a little bit older.

01:10:31.458 --> 01:10:32.708
Nice.

01:10:32.917 --> 01:10:34.750
Condescending, or what?

01:10:37.667 --> 01:10:39.458
Don't be childish.

01:10:39.667 --> 01:10:41.958
Mommy and Daddy
are probably looking for me.

01:10:42.875 --> 01:10:44.875
Wouldn't want to keep them waiting.

01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:59.333
I need you to delete
those text messages now.

01:11:33.625 --> 01:11:34.792
You okay?

01:11:39.208 --> 01:11:41.083
Supposedly,
she got a huge tattoo of a pentagram

01:11:41.292 --> 01:11:44.000
on her back right above her ass.
What's up with that?

01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:47.792
She is a witch.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.125
Her parents are witches foo.
It's like witch pride or something.

01:11:51.333 --> 01:11:55.125
Yeah, but a big witch tattoo at 16?
Isn't that a little nutso?

01:11:57.833 --> 01:11:59.792
God, I mean, why do people feel
this constant need

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.375
to shove their beliefs
down everyone's throat?

01:12:03.083 --> 01:12:04.333
Like mine?

01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:10.583
You know, at least Sierra
wouldn't stop being  witch

01:12:10.792 --> 01:12:13.292
'cause some guy came around.
- Yeah, she wouldn't, like,

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:14.792
ditch her witches.

01:12:36.708 --> 01:12:38.542
I love the violin.

01:14:08.042 --> 01:14:09.042
Okay.

01:14:13.417 --> 01:14:14.542
Okay.

01:14:15.375 --> 01:14:17.375
Okay. okay?

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.167
All right? Okay.

01:14:28.458 --> 01:14:29.458
It's okay.

01:14:33.458 --> 01:14:36.042
It's Spencer.
You want to tell him you're okay?

01:14:36.208 --> 01:14:37.250
Don't

01:14:40.917 --> 01:14:42.125
Okay.

01:14:54.792 --> 01:14:56.250
Tic-Tue.

01:14:58.458 --> 01:15:01.792
You need some greasy brunch
to soak up that hangover?

01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:03.875
Go away.

01:16:10.958 --> 01:16:12.917
Ben Carter has resigned.

01:16:13.458 --> 01:16:14.417
What?

01:16:16.250 --> 01:16:18.542
This isn't even on school property.

01:16:21.417 --> 01:16:23.375
You want to talk about that?

01:16:23.583 --> 01:16:25.792
I was practicing making a fake photo.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.583
Ben's superimposed.
- Molly.

01:16:28.375 --> 01:16:30.042
This isn't a fake photo, is it?

01:16:30.250 --> 01:16:32.375
Well, that doesn't prove anything.

01:16:34.083 --> 01:16:38.625
Molly, the fact is, leaving school
property with a student, alone,

01:16:38.833 --> 01:16:42.417
without the permission of your parents,
is a serious enough offence just on its own.

01:16:42.625 --> 01:16:44.875
We were just taking photos.
Nothing happened.

01:16:45.833 --> 01:16:47.458
What could have happened?

01:16:47.667 --> 01:16:50.000
Are you gonna bring out
the bad touching doll now?

01:16:50.208 --> 01:16:54.042
Give me a break.
- Molly! Show him some respect.

01:16:54.250 --> 01:16:57.417
Okay, look,
this happens all the time, okay?

01:16:57.625 --> 01:16:59.833
In fact, just last week,
I met a girl your age

01:17:00.042 --> 01:17:03.250
who was being taken advantage of
by her basketball coach.

01:17:03.458 --> 01:17:05.458
She thought she was special,

01:17:05.667 --> 01:17:08.750
Thought she was the only one
he'd ever break the rules for.

01:17:08.958 --> 01:17:11.208
Turns out he'd done it four times.

01:17:13.292 --> 01:17:15.042
No one took advantage of me.

01:17:17.250 --> 01:17:20.542
We need to discuss if you and your parents
want to press charges

01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:22.750
against Ben Carter.
- For-- No!

01:17:25.125 --> 01:17:27.958
Maybe we just need some time
alone with our... our daughter.

01:17:28.167 --> 01:17:30.542
Wait, wait, wait, not so fast.

01:17:30.792 --> 01:17:36.208
Mr. Maxwell, we really don't have
any evidence if she doesn't cooperate.

01:17:48.208 --> 01:17:49.542
Who's Spencer?

01:17:54.542 --> 01:17:56.292
He's my boyfriend.

01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:58.042
No, he isn't

01:17:59.833 --> 01:18:01.375
I say we call this Spencer

01:18:01.583 --> 01:18:03.417
and see who? he knows--
- You know...

01:18:04.750 --> 01:18:06.875
I don't think that's necessary.
- Why not?

01:18:07.833 --> 01:18:10.583
Because I don't think
we should get Spencer involved.

01:18:10.792 --> 01:18:12.500
You know this Spencer guy?

01:18:16.375 --> 01:18:18.417
He goes to Parkdale High.

01:18:20.250 --> 01:18:22.167
He plays the trumpet

01:19:20.833 --> 01:19:22.375
Hey, Molly.

01:19:23.042 --> 01:19:24.250
So, is it true?

01:19:26.167 --> 01:19:28.167
That's so fucking awesome.

01:19:29.458 --> 01:19:30.625
Totally knew, by the way.

01:19:30.833 --> 01:19:33.667
Didn't I tell you?
- No.

01:19:36.625 --> 01:19:40.417
Ben's like, what, 26?
Why can't he get a girl his own age?

01:19:40.625 --> 01:19:43.250
My parents are, like, 10 years apart.

01:19:43.458 --> 01:19:45.292
My mom was, like, 18.

01:19:46.833 --> 01:19:48.625
Yeah, but she's 16.

01:19:48.833 --> 01:19:52.583
I mean, she just got her braces off,
like, what, six months ago?

01:19:53.667 --> 01:19:55.125
Think he's done it before?

01:20:32.875 --> 01:20:34.542
Hey, your favourite movie's on.

01:20:39.208 --> 01:20:41.167
That's not my favourite movie.

01:20:41.375 --> 01:20:43.250
What are you talking about?
Of course it is.

01:20:43.458 --> 01:20:45.042
No, it isn't.

01:20:48.958 --> 01:20:52.208
Well, you're grounded,
so don't even think about going out.

01:20:55.667 --> 01:20:56.875
Okay.

01:21:22.125 --> 01:21:23.792
Did he take this?

01:21:24.375 --> 01:21:25.583
Yeah.

01:21:32.167 --> 01:21:33.458
You look beautiful.

01:21:41.167 --> 01:21:42.792
Look...

01:21:47.375 --> 01:21:49.208
I don't know this guy like you do.

01:21:50.042 --> 01:21:55.042
But I do know that teachers aren't supposed
to mess around with their students.

01:21:59.375 --> 01:22:01.292
You're a smart kid.

01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:06.125
An amazing young woman,
actually.

01:22:07.208 --> 01:22:09.583
You're gonna make your own mistakes.

01:22:12.625 --> 01:22:13.833
You'll live.

01:22:23.292 --> 01:22:24.875
Call me if you need me.

01:22:25.583 --> 01:22:27.542
Or text me, or...

01:22:28.458 --> 01:22:29.792
email me, or...

01:22:31.833 --> 01:22:33.250
or write on my wall.

01:22:40.458 --> 01:22:41.792
Thank you.

01:22:47.833 --> 01:22:49.125
Okay.

01:23:21.542 --> 01:23:23.167
You're here.

01:23:23.375 --> 01:23:24.917
Here I am.

01:23:27.083 --> 01:23:30.042
Your parents didn't barricade you
in your room?

01:23:30.250 --> 01:23:34.333
My dad's actually probably
taking this opportunity to fit the locks.

01:23:37.417 --> 01:23:38.708
How have you been?

01:23:39.833 --> 01:23:40.792
You know...

01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:44.208
Relieved not to be in jail.

01:23:45.875 --> 01:23:48.792
Thanks for that, by the way.
- Welcome.

01:23:50.583 --> 01:23:52.542
I think you're gonna like
this first song.

01:23:54.125 --> 01:23:55.333
It's called Hand Grenade.

01:24:00.458 --> 01:24:03.458
Ben, I just wanted to say
I'm really sorry.

01:24:04.792 --> 01:24:06.208
Sorry for what?

01:24:07.708 --> 01:24:09.458
For developing the rolls.

01:24:11.250 --> 01:24:12.458
And everything.

01:24:18.583 --> 01:24:20.083
Ain't no thing.

01:24:27.667 --> 01:24:30.042
Maybe we could get
something to eat after.

01:24:32.250 --> 01:24:33.625
I don't think so.

01:24:34.792 --> 01:24:35.792
Yeah.

01:24:36.917 --> 01:24:38.292
Probably not.

01:24:40.250 --> 01:24:41.875
I have to go now.

01:24:52.375 --> 01:24:53.583
Hi.

01:24:55.250 --> 01:24:58.042
This is my first ever solo show.

01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:02.417
And this is gonna be the first song
that I have ever written,

01:25:03.292 --> 01:25:05.625
so I hope it's not too painful.

01:26:03.375 --> 01:26:05.167
ID?
- Pardon me?

01:26:05.375 --> 01:26:08.208
Do you have any ID?
- Oh, I'm not drinking.

01:26:10.542 --> 01:26:11.958
Seriously?
- Sorry.

01:26:12.305 --> 01:26:18.721
