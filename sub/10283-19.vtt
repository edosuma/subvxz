WEBVTT

00:03.570 --> 00:04.772
Previously on ER.

00:04.772 --> 00:06.507
Change the orders.

00:06.507 --> 00:08.542
This means war, you know.

00:08.542 --> 00:10.811
Look, we never talked
about being monogamous.

00:10.811 --> 00:13.181
We never said anything
about not being monogamous.

00:13.181 --> 00:17.085
The surgery is gonna take away
my crutch. Who will I be then?

00:17.085 --> 00:18.619
You're sending
me to Africa?
Yeah.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.354
How did you
get in here?

00:20.354 --> 00:21.622
I got lots of experience

00:21.622 --> 00:23.291
getting into dumps
like this, Vic.

( clearing throat )

00:35.269 --> 00:36.537
Hey, this is Jody.

00:36.537 --> 00:40.074
Leave a message
and I'll call you back.

00:40.074 --> 00:41.209
Hey, Jodes.

00:41.209 --> 00:42.643
Yeah, I know it's late there

00:42.643 --> 00:44.578
and you're probably
sleeping and whatnot.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.780
I just wanted
to call and say hi. Yeah.

00:56.424 --> 00:59.393
Yeah, well, board's a mess
and it's the usual.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.195
Bunch of lowlifes.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.631
Yeah. I don't know
when I'm going to get out.

01:03.631 --> 01:06.867
Yeah, you know, I heard,
I heard you got six inches.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.202
Of snow.

01:08.202 --> 01:09.237
Yeah. In April.

01:09.237 --> 01:11.539
Go figure, huh?

01:11.539 --> 01:14.175
Alright, um...

01:14.175 --> 01:15.476
I'll call you tomorrow.

01:15.476 --> 01:17.678
I love you. Bye.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.351
Dr. Clemente?

01:59.387 --> 02:02.190
Lateral decubitus
on the coin ingestion.

02:02.190 --> 02:03.424
Dr. Lockhart said

02:03.424 --> 02:04.458
that we could
discharge.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.626
Hey, who are you?

02:05.626 --> 02:07.195
Uh, I'm Jane.

02:07.195 --> 02:08.496
I'm an intern.

02:08.496 --> 02:11.199
Hey, how come I never
seen you before... Jane?

02:11.199 --> 02:12.733
I... I don't know.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.268
I mostly work nights.

02:14.268 --> 02:15.736
I work nights.

02:15.736 --> 02:18.706
And?

02:18.706 --> 02:20.674
Did you want to see these?

02:27.815 --> 02:29.717
Thought you were gone
two hours ago.

02:29.717 --> 02:31.285
I'm a dedicated guy.

02:31.285 --> 02:32.753
What can I say, huh?

02:32.753 --> 02:35.223
Want to help me
stock some shelves?

02:35.223 --> 02:38.226
Do I want to
help you what?

02:38.226 --> 02:39.693
Dr. Clemente.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.529
Dr. Pratt for you on line two.

02:41.529 --> 02:43.264
It's about time.

02:43.264 --> 02:44.298
Hey, Pratski.

02:44.298 --> 02:45.333
Hey, I got

02:45.333 --> 02:46.634
a patient here, Ottley,

02:46.634 --> 02:48.469
claims that you
promised him some Vicodin?

02:48.469 --> 02:50.504
That's right.
He came in with a migraine.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.306
I resolved it with imitrex

02:52.306 --> 02:55.576
I told him I'd give him Vicodin
in case the pain came back.

02:55.576 --> 02:56.810
I think he's playing us,

02:56.810 --> 02:58.346
drug-seeking and whatnot.

02:58.346 --> 03:00.281
Vic, write him the scrip, man.

03:00.281 --> 03:03.351
Hey, you know, you know what
I was thinking the other day?

03:03.351 --> 03:05.386
Remember the time
on top of the roof?

03:05.386 --> 03:06.620
Where we talked. Remember that?

03:06.620 --> 03:07.855
What's the matter
with you?

03:07.855 --> 03:09.257
Is Jody okay?

03:09.257 --> 03:10.458
Yeah, Jody's great, she's great.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.826
It's just, uh...

03:12.826 --> 03:15.896
It's just her ex, Bobby, keeps
sending these weird

03:15.896 --> 03:18.599
freaking sympathy cards.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.668
This one, the latest, was filled

03:20.668 --> 03:22.603
with this bunch
of little dead goldfish.

03:22.603 --> 03:23.937
What?!

03:23.937 --> 03:25.573
What's he trying to tell me?

03:25.573 --> 03:27.441
That whole "sleeps
with the fishes" thing?

03:27.441 --> 03:30.278
Okay, look. I think you should
give Mr. Ottley his drugs,

03:30.278 --> 03:31.879
go home and get some sleep.

03:31.879 --> 03:32.913
Alright?

03:32.913 --> 03:34.415
Okay. Alright. Alright.

03:34.415 --> 03:36.317
Thanks, man. Thanks. Okay.

03:36.317 --> 03:37.751
You have fun in the motherland,

03:37.751 --> 03:39.453
alright?
Right.

03:53.301 --> 03:55.436
Two Vicodin?
That's it?

03:55.436 --> 03:58.739
Dr. Pratt said...
Yeah, well, Dr. Pratt's
not here, okay, Mr. Ottley?

03:58.739 --> 04:00.708
What if my migraine comes back?

04:00.708 --> 04:02.543
Well, you take those
and you call

04:02.543 --> 04:03.977
your regular doctor
in the morning

04:03.977 --> 04:05.679
Okay? You got
any more questions?

04:10.718 --> 04:12.753
Hey, Jer, what else
you got for me?

04:12.753 --> 04:14.555
Possibly the slowest
night on record

04:14.555 --> 04:16.656
and I... am out of here.

04:16.656 --> 04:18.892
You going?
Yeah.

04:18.892 --> 04:21.995
Well, hang on, hang on.
I'll, I'll go with you.
Alright.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.435
You want to go
to Ike's and grab a beer?

04:27.435 --> 04:30.738
I would but actually I'm waiting
on a friend to pick me up.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.740
That's alright,
he can join us.

04:32.740 --> 04:33.907
What's the big deal?

04:33.907 --> 04:35.609
Well, uh...

04:35.609 --> 04:38.346
It's actually a friend
of the female variety.

04:38.346 --> 04:40.748
Ah, I gotcha.
Gotcha. Right. Right.

04:40.748 --> 04:42.483
Next time.

04:42.483 --> 04:43.651
Okay.

04:43.651 --> 04:47.621
Yeah. So, um, I'll
be going then.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.657
Okay. Goodnight.

04:49.657 --> 04:50.758
Take it easy.

05:02.670 --> 05:05.439
( men laughing )

05:21.389 --> 05:24.024
( footsteps approaching )

05:33.867 --> 05:36.103
You want to take
me on you little prick?!

05:36.103 --> 05:38.506
You want to take me out?
Is that it?!

06:38.899 --> 06:41.635
Okay. You did it.

06:43.671 --> 06:45.739
I can't believe
I'm done.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.207
Happy graduation day.

06:47.207 --> 06:49.543
Looking forward
to getting back to work?

06:49.543 --> 06:51.545
I've been back
for about a week,

06:51.545 --> 06:53.180
trying to keep up
with my paperwork.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.748
Well.

06:56.484 --> 06:57.885
Here's one thing
you don't need

06:57.885 --> 06:59.086
to keep up
with anymore.

07:01.188 --> 07:02.823
Thanks for everything.

07:02.823 --> 07:03.924
Ah.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.893
Abdominal breathing.
10 reps a day.

07:05.893 --> 07:08.228
Okay.

07:08.228 --> 07:11.999
Lenore Bee, 43, ten foot fall
from a second story window.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.867
Are we here?
W-what're we doing?

07:13.867 --> 07:15.636
What happened
to the 12 year-old?

07:15.636 --> 07:17.671
Morris, why are
you wearing...?
A Prada suit?

07:17.671 --> 07:20.508
No reason.
Is-is he a doctor? I want him.

07:20.508 --> 07:23.210
Dr. Archie Morris
at your service, ma'am.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.879
12-year-old MVC complains
of tenderness over the sternum.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.781
What's your name?
Ruthie Pooler.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.619
You got this?
Yeah.

07:31.619 --> 07:34.054
( dog barks )
Oh, and you get
to have this, too.

07:34.054 --> 07:37.558
And I recommend a face mask.
Damn mutt farted all way here.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.192
Abdominal pain,
low-grade fever.

07:39.192 --> 07:40.894
Doc was worried
about appendicitis,

07:40.894 --> 07:42.930
so he figured he'd
get a surgical consult.

07:42.930 --> 07:44.598
The guy seems fine to me.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.802
Kovac.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.605
Nice to see you again.

07:51.605 --> 07:53.874
You didn't need to come
in here, Grandma.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.709
Of course
I needed to.

07:55.709 --> 07:56.977
My eyes don't hurt.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.812
I'm checking for signs
of head trauma.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.682
I was only going
like two miles an hour.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.183
You were driving?

08:03.183 --> 08:04.752
Did you know about that?

08:04.752 --> 08:06.219
RUTHIE:
Did you tell

08:06.219 --> 08:08.722
your family everything you
did when you were 12?

08:08.722 --> 08:10.057
I did not know.

08:10.057 --> 08:12.626
I wanted to pick up
your prescriptions and still

08:12.626 --> 08:14.862
get to school
before first period.
Let me see.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.564
What about your parents?

08:16.564 --> 08:19.166
Oh, uh, Ruthie's mother
and father died

08:19.166 --> 08:20.801
when she was
six months old.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.235
I was about a year, Grandma.

08:22.235 --> 08:23.303
I'm sorry.
( coughing )

08:23.303 --> 08:25.205
I would be, too,
if I remembered.

08:25.205 --> 08:27.140
( dog farts )

08:27.140 --> 08:29.677
( both laughing )

08:29.677 --> 08:32.145
Oh. Bob, ooh,
he's a regular

08:32.145 --> 08:33.780
wind tunnel this
morning, isn't he?

08:33.780 --> 08:35.215
Ruthie, we're gonna
keep you here

08:35.215 --> 08:36.884
for a little while
for observation.

08:36.884 --> 08:39.152
Grandma,
maybe Dr... Lockhart

08:39.152 --> 08:40.788
can ask you
about your cough.

08:40.788 --> 08:42.222
Sure, we can
check that out.

08:42.222 --> 08:43.890
What about the dog?

08:43.890 --> 08:46.093
Oh, uh, I think
it's his diet.

08:46.093 --> 08:48.696
No, no. Uh, he can't
be here, even temporarily.

08:48.696 --> 08:51.264
Is there someplace
where you can keep him?

08:51.264 --> 08:53.000
So should I call the SPCA?

08:53.000 --> 08:55.803
Oh!
Bob's 13 years old.

08:55.803 --> 08:58.305
Don't get me wrong--
I support the SPCA.

08:58.305 --> 08:59.940
but, they take him,

08:59.940 --> 09:01.775
I'm stuck here
a day or two

09:01.775 --> 09:04.211
and for some reason
my Grandma can't get him out,

09:04.211 --> 09:05.813
they may put him down.

09:05.813 --> 09:07.815
So if Bob goes...

09:07.815 --> 09:10.183
I go with him.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.620
You're sure you
don't want this?

09:12.620 --> 09:13.787
HALEH:
You'll be sorry.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.222
Lenore, did you
lose consciousness?

09:15.222 --> 09:17.858
No, Dr. Archie.
I remember everything.

09:17.858 --> 09:18.892
Cleaning my windows...

09:18.892 --> 09:20.728
Next thing I know, bam! Fell out

09:20.728 --> 09:22.162
right smack dab
in the middle.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.664
Gotta worry
about the spleen?

09:23.664 --> 09:24.898
Good bowel sounds,
slightly tender

09:24.898 --> 09:27.034
in the left
upper quadrant.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.268
She on meth?

09:28.268 --> 09:30.638
Okay, possible left
tenth rib fracture.

09:30.638 --> 09:31.839
Whoa. Whoa.

09:31.839 --> 09:33.874
Whoa... kay!

09:33.874 --> 09:34.908
You know...

09:34.908 --> 09:36.677
You know what?

09:36.677 --> 09:37.945
If you don't mind.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.379
You want me
to hold it?

09:39.379 --> 09:40.981
What's with the suit, man?

09:40.981 --> 09:43.216
Uh, you know what?
Keep this on the QT,

09:43.216 --> 09:45.653
but I took a job
with Ladokern Pharmaceuticals.

09:45.653 --> 09:48.355
Doesn't start till July 1st
but, uh... signing bonus.

09:48.355 --> 09:50.924
Always been my dream:
pushing over-priced meds

09:50.924 --> 09:53.226
to people who probably
don't even need them.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.763
Always been
to hold Dr. Archie's coat.

09:55.763 --> 09:56.830
Okay.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.298
Trauma panel, c-spine, chest.

09:58.298 --> 10:01.234
Page Surgery and let's
get an ultrasound.

10:01.234 --> 10:04.004
Will Ruthie's X-rays
only take a little while?

10:04.004 --> 10:05.238
Only about 30 minutes.

10:05.238 --> 10:06.874
Isn't that
what you said?

10:06.874 --> 10:08.175
Yeah, something
like that.

10:08.175 --> 10:10.310
Will you take
another deep breath in?

10:10.310 --> 10:13.714
( inhales, coughs )

10:13.714 --> 10:15.348
How long have you
had that cough?

10:15.348 --> 10:18.118
Oh, about three or four years.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.287
Since Jimmy Carter
was president, I guess.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.722
Since you wished
Jimmy Carter

10:21.722 --> 10:23.390
was president,
right, Grandma?

10:23.390 --> 10:25.225
I write his name in every time.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.661
Still waiting for Radiology.
Shouldn't be too much longer.

10:27.661 --> 10:29.362
Thanks.

10:29.362 --> 10:31.799
Don't worry, dear, they
said it would only take

10:31.799 --> 10:32.966
about 30 minutes.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.937
Can you remind me
again, when was

10:36.937 --> 10:38.105
Jimmy Carter
elected?

10:38.105 --> 10:40.407
I think it was back...
Mrs. Pooler?

10:40.407 --> 10:44.945
Well, sometime before
this latest bozo.

10:44.945 --> 10:47.280
Oh, thank you.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.750
You know, I don't
much like any of them.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.284
You want to know why?

10:51.284 --> 10:53.954
I don't think Dr. Lockhart
cares much about our politics.

10:53.954 --> 10:55.889
Stamps.

10:55.889 --> 10:58.191
The price
of stamps.

10:58.191 --> 11:00.060
They all keep
raising them.

11:00.060 --> 11:04.064
This latest increase--
can you believe it?

11:04.064 --> 11:07.034
19 cents for first class.

11:09.036 --> 11:10.938
19 cents?

11:10.938 --> 11:12.405
Come on, Grandma.

11:12.405 --> 11:15.042
You know it's gone up
a lot more than that.

11:15.042 --> 11:16.276
Yeah, I know, I know,

11:16.276 --> 11:18.345
but I don't like
to think about it.

11:20.047 --> 11:22.315
If Ruthie has
to stay in here,

11:22.315 --> 11:25.052
it won't be more than
a couple days, right?

11:25.052 --> 11:28.188
'Cause I really do want
her home for Easter.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.222
Grandma...

11:29.222 --> 11:32.025
I think Easter was last week.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.896
Well, I certainly hope not.

11:35.896 --> 11:38.031
We're picking up the ham
on Saturday.

11:41.101 --> 11:43.771
We got four cases backed up
in the O.R.,

11:43.771 --> 11:45.238
so this had better be real.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.107
I'm Dr. Albright,
from Surgery.

11:47.107 --> 11:48.241
Does your belly hurt?

11:48.241 --> 11:49.943
I guess so.
Here you go.

11:55.348 --> 11:57.017
Fluid in
Morrison's pouch?

11:57.017 --> 11:58.285
That looks like it.

12:03.423 --> 12:07.961
Blood anterior to the bladder
and in the splenorenal recess.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.529
I've seen enough.

12:09.529 --> 12:11.431
Prep her for the O.R.

12:11.431 --> 12:14.835
I think we should get a C.T.
She's unstable. She's anemic.

12:14.835 --> 12:15.869
Could be chronic.

12:15.869 --> 12:16.904
She's hypotensive.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.806
BP normalized
with a liter.

12:18.806 --> 12:21.441
She's bleeding
in her belly.
End of story.

12:21.441 --> 12:22.976
Get her upstairs.

12:24.044 --> 12:25.145
Guess you told her.

12:25.145 --> 12:26.814
Repeat the hemocue,

12:26.814 --> 12:29.382
get a serum albumin
and a urine protein.

12:29.382 --> 12:30.818
Yeah, but
that could take...

12:30.818 --> 12:32.519
Yes, Haleh, it could.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.387
KOVAC:
Sam, just wanted

12:34.387 --> 12:36.023
to give you
a head's up.

12:36.023 --> 12:37.858
Steve's in Exam 2 now.
I know.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.893
Hey, we can get
another nurse.
It's okay.

12:39.893 --> 12:40.994
Luka, thank you.

12:40.994 --> 12:41.995
I can handle it.

12:44.965 --> 12:48.068
Hey, Sam.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.837
They thought it
was appendicitis?

12:49.837 --> 12:52.906
Yeah. I was in a lot of pain
on the drive over,

12:52.906 --> 12:54.942
but I feel okay now.

12:54.942 --> 12:57.277
I figured they'd
assign me another nurse.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.346
Just doing my job.

13:02.015 --> 13:05.018
So things are
going pretty well, huh?

13:05.018 --> 13:07.120
Alex writes me
a lot of letters now.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.257
Yeah, I know.
Your temp's 99.4.

13:12.092 --> 13:15.462
I'm happy for you, Sam.

13:15.462 --> 13:18.999
New job,
new place to live...

13:18.999 --> 13:22.302
What's with the cross?

13:22.302 --> 13:24.537
Oh, the chaplain
gave it to me.

13:24.537 --> 13:27.140
You keeping up on
your Bible studies?

13:27.140 --> 13:32.079
Yeah. Picking up
a thing or two.

13:32.079 --> 13:35.582
And it doesn't hurt
that those are the guys
that watch your back.

13:38.551 --> 13:41.521
Your B.P.'s 124/80.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.456
That's good, right?

13:43.456 --> 13:45.525
It's normal.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.963
You think I'm faking this pain,
don't you?

13:51.631 --> 13:54.534
A lot of guys do
just so they can get out.

13:54.534 --> 13:55.602
Yeah.

13:55.602 --> 13:57.570
I can't say I blame them.

13:57.570 --> 14:00.173
There's one thing
you can say about jail--

14:00.173 --> 14:02.575
it's everything
it's cracked up to be.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.518
One of the docs will be in
to check you out.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.088
with abdominal pain--
rule out appy.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.423
Oh, we got a "detainee"?

14:16.423 --> 14:18.992
Pain was ten out of ten.
Now it's resolved.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.427
Resolved? That's convenient.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.462
Dr. Clemente,
I feel I should tell you

14:22.462 --> 14:23.931
that Mr. Curtis
and Sam...

14:23.931 --> 14:26.199
Neela.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.936
It's my ex--
my kid's dad.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.537
Oh, wow. That must
be really tough

14:30.537 --> 14:32.039
on your little boy, huh?

14:32.039 --> 14:33.440
It is what it is.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.408
Hello, Mr. Curtis.
I'm Dr. Clemente.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.244
You feeling any tenderness
at all anywhere?

14:37.244 --> 14:38.411
No. It's better now.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.213
His white
count's 10,000.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.649
Well, that's not very impressive
at all, now, is it?

14:42.649 --> 14:44.384
Pulse is down
after a liter.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.386
It was pretty painful
for a while.

14:46.386 --> 14:49.156
Oh, yeah? Could be
the stomach flu though, right?

14:49.156 --> 14:50.991
That kind of thing
can run rampant

14:50.991 --> 14:52.159
through half
the population.

14:52.159 --> 14:54.561
Close quarters?
You're a riot.

14:56.296 --> 14:59.532
Anyway, anyway...
You're feeling better, right?

14:59.532 --> 15:02.569
And Dr. Rasgotra here
will sign you out.

15:03.971 --> 15:05.372
He has a low grade fever.

15:05.372 --> 15:07.407
Maybe we should
observe him for a bit.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.242
It's barely
a low grade fever. Please.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.510
CBC shows a left shift.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.479
Yeah, but there's
no leukocytosis.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.314
Look, I can appreciate
these guys wanting

15:14.314 --> 15:16.583
to get out of the can
now and then,

15:16.583 --> 15:18.651
but we're not running
a time-share here, okay?

15:18.651 --> 15:20.487
Just release him.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.992
I'm sorry if you
didn't want me

15:24.992 --> 15:26.526
to mention your
relationship.

15:26.526 --> 15:29.262
That's okay. I just don't
like people protecting me.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.431
You want to write up
his aftercare?

15:31.431 --> 15:32.699
No. Repeat the CBC.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.734
You don't have
to do that for me.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.369
I'm not
doing it for you.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.205
His history
tells me to do it.

15:38.205 --> 15:41.041
History? What?
Lies and deception?

15:41.041 --> 15:43.376
You never really
thought he was sick?

15:43.376 --> 15:45.745
I don't know. Clemente examined
him and released him.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.714
He's a patient like anyone else.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.649
Repeat the CBC.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.620
So it's not Alzheimer's?

15:53.620 --> 15:56.323
No. But there
are similarities

15:56.323 --> 15:58.025
in how it
affects people.

15:58.025 --> 15:59.592
And, with this
type of dementia,

15:59.592 --> 16:02.329
it can sometimes
progress very quickly.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.531
But that means
sometimes it can be slow.

16:04.531 --> 16:06.399
Ruthie, let the doctor talk.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.702
There are some concerns,
Mrs. Pooler,

16:09.702 --> 16:11.738
about your ability
to take care of Ruthie--

16:11.738 --> 16:14.307
to make decisions,
to cook...

16:14.307 --> 16:16.543
I can cook.
I can make decisions.

16:16.543 --> 16:19.279
Like you did
about driving this morning?

16:19.279 --> 16:21.414
And Social Services

16:21.414 --> 16:23.516
is going to want to talk to you.

16:23.516 --> 16:26.086
Most likely, they're going
to want to discuss

16:26.086 --> 16:28.155
putting Ruthie into foster care.

16:28.155 --> 16:29.489
They can't do that!

16:29.489 --> 16:31.324
You can't do that!
That's not fair!

16:31.324 --> 16:32.792
We're not going to let
them.

16:32.792 --> 16:35.062
Ruthie...
I don't take the
car very much.

16:35.062 --> 16:36.563
And I've never
hit anything before.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.131
I know everything
she needs--

16:38.131 --> 16:39.299
all of her
prescriptions:

16:40.667 --> 16:41.734
Neurontin,

16:41.734 --> 16:44.237
300 milligrams,
twice a day,

16:44.237 --> 16:47.407
Diltiazem, 240
milligrams a day,

16:47.407 --> 16:50.177
Stop.
Lanoxin, .125
milligrams a day.

16:50.177 --> 16:51.711
Stop it now.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.784
RUTHIE:
Please, please, don't
let this happen.

16:57.784 --> 17:00.387
I don't want
anything to change.

17:00.387 --> 17:05.525
Ruthie,
when your mama and daddy died,

17:05.525 --> 17:10.363
I thought that nothing
would ever be the same.

17:10.363 --> 17:13.200
And then we took

17:13.200 --> 17:15.602
the worst possible moments,

17:15.602 --> 17:18.471
and we turned it
into years and years

17:18.471 --> 17:22.675
of the best possible moments.

17:22.675 --> 17:23.710
Didn't we?

17:23.710 --> 17:26.213
Yes.

17:26.213 --> 17:30.650
Now, I know that,
at least about this one thing,

17:30.650 --> 17:33.786
Grandma is not confused,
am I?

17:33.786 --> 17:35.288
No.

17:35.288 --> 17:38.225
( chuckling ):
No. That's my girl.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.692
Oh, yeah.

17:44.131 --> 17:47.734
Oh, okay, so you don't want me
to hold the coat this time?

17:47.734 --> 17:49.769
Had a little talk
with myself this afternoon.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.871
I said, "Archie, you...
You know what?

17:51.871 --> 17:53.773
"You are Dr. Archie Morris.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.842
You don't need
no stinking Prada suit."

17:55.842 --> 17:57.577
What did you spill?

17:57.577 --> 17:59.146
Coffee.

17:59.146 --> 18:02.149
A little numbing medicine here,
Lenore.

18:02.149 --> 18:03.850
Morris, what the hell
are you doing?

18:03.850 --> 18:05.418
Peritoneal aspirate.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.154
Is your name Morris ?

18:07.154 --> 18:08.255
Her crit was stable,

18:08.255 --> 18:09.556
so I decided
to do...

18:09.556 --> 18:11.591
I have been waiting
for half an hour.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.826
I discovered she's been
on lithium for a year.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.262
Oh, and that changes everything?

18:15.262 --> 18:16.863
Not quite everything, but...

18:18.331 --> 18:19.532
Whoa, whoa. Wait.

18:19.532 --> 18:20.900
She's prepped
and draped.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.902
And bleeding internally.
What's going on?

18:22.902 --> 18:25.838
Wait, wait. The lithium could
cause nephrotic syndrome.

18:25.838 --> 18:28.275
Tell me something I don't know.
Okay, her hypotension

18:28.275 --> 18:29.909
could be vasovagal
from the rib pain.

18:29.909 --> 18:31.744
Oh, you want to
make that assumption?

18:31.744 --> 18:33.213
Where... where am I going?

18:33.213 --> 18:34.847
Hold on, honey-- they're
figuring it out.

18:34.847 --> 18:37.484
She may not need the O.R.
You know what?

18:37.484 --> 18:40.753
I feel very strongly
about this, Dr. Albright.
Oh, you do, do you?

18:40.753 --> 18:43.256
Yes, I do.

18:43.256 --> 18:44.491
Morris!

18:48.895 --> 18:52.332
Wow.
Wow.

18:52.332 --> 18:54.201
Straw-colored fluid,

18:54.201 --> 18:55.435
not blood.

18:55.435 --> 18:56.736
It's ascites,
from nephrotic syndrome.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.238
She doesn't need surgery.

18:58.238 --> 19:00.240
She needs steroids
and a kidney biopsy.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.519
Hey. Double trauma
pulling up

19:46.519 --> 19:47.954
if you're looking
for some action.

19:47.954 --> 19:50.390
No. I got to
head upstairs.

19:50.390 --> 19:54.461
Dr. Morris, sorry we
missed you in your suit.
How did you know about my suit?

19:54.461 --> 19:56.296
I know everything.
Everything?

19:56.296 --> 19:58.331
Dr. Weaver, don't
suppose I can get you

19:58.331 --> 20:00.367
to look at this
open tib-fib in Four?

20:00.367 --> 20:02.835
Sorry, Chuny.
I'm not on today.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.737
Okay.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.810
Dr. Weaver.
Dr. Albright.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.582
ABBY:
Don't worry about it.
I'm handling it.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.417
You haven't even called
Social Services yet.

20:17.417 --> 20:20.287
I didn't say that.
I said they put me on hold.

20:20.287 --> 20:22.722
Do you really think
you're going to
make things easier

20:22.722 --> 20:24.324
by... by keeping
them around?

20:24.324 --> 20:27.327
No.
Well, it's not easy.

20:27.327 --> 20:28.628
They've always
had each other.

20:28.628 --> 20:30.297
I know, and it's
horribly sad,

20:30.297 --> 20:31.764
but it can't
stay that way.

20:31.764 --> 20:34.567
Well, we don't know that
100% for sure, do we?

20:34.567 --> 20:36.903
That woman has bilateral
lacunar infarcts.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.271
She's going
to decompensate,

20:38.271 --> 20:39.706
sooner rather
than later.

20:39.706 --> 20:41.941
And what? She's going to
raise a 12-year-old?

20:41.941 --> 20:43.676
Well, a very mature
12-year-old

20:43.676 --> 20:45.512
that seems, so far,
to have done

20:45.512 --> 20:47.580
a very good job of
holding it together.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.048
They're a family, Luka.

20:49.048 --> 20:50.717
Why aren't we
fighting for that?

20:50.717 --> 20:52.519
Kids shouldn't
be caretakers.

20:54.321 --> 20:55.655
Sometimes
they have to be.

20:55.655 --> 20:57.424
Look, I know,
in Croatia,

20:57.424 --> 20:59.292
you grew up like
Ozzie and Harriet.

20:59.292 --> 21:00.927
And I'm sorry.
I know you probably

21:00.927 --> 21:02.962
don't even know what
Ozzie and Harriet is.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.597
But whatever.
The thing is, yes,

21:04.597 --> 21:06.433
it's going to get
harder and harder,

21:06.433 --> 21:08.668
but that doesn't mean,
they're not better off together.

21:08.668 --> 21:10.770
Like you were better off
with your mother?

21:12.772 --> 21:14.507
Sorry.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.909
You know, that girl is
healthy, she's in school,

21:16.909 --> 21:18.378
she's in a loving
environment.

21:18.378 --> 21:19.612
The grandmother is
still functioning.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.414
She can still
handle her ADLs.

21:21.414 --> 21:24.484
Yeah, for now
If you had asked me
when I was 12,

21:24.484 --> 21:26.919
if I wanted to be taken
away from my mother,

21:26.919 --> 21:32.024
I would have said no.
It's not our job
to let 12-year-olds decide.

21:32.024 --> 21:33.693
Ruthie.

21:33.693 --> 21:37.797
Hey, Ruthie!
Stop!

21:37.797 --> 21:39.566
Very mature.

21:39.566 --> 21:41.000
FRANK:
Neela, your repeat blood work

21:41.000 --> 21:43.370
is back on your
no doubt unfairly-prosecuted,

21:43.370 --> 21:45.104
wrongly-incarcerated
rule out appy.

21:45.104 --> 21:47.540
Hey. I told you
to discharge him, didn't I?

21:47.540 --> 21:49.376
His white count's up to 12,000.

21:49.376 --> 21:50.743
Big deal. So what?

21:50.743 --> 21:52.779
If his appendix burst
on the way here,

21:52.779 --> 21:55.615
his pain might've been relieved.
We should see if he declares.

21:55.615 --> 21:56.849
He's got to go.

21:56.849 --> 21:58.084
Temperature's up to 100.4.

21:58.084 --> 21:59.519
Could be an appy.
Right.

21:59.519 --> 22:00.720
No way. It's
impossible.

22:00.720 --> 22:01.988
Let me take a look.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.623
The initial exam
could've been done

22:03.623 --> 22:04.891
in the post-perforation
window.

22:04.891 --> 22:06.125
He'd have signs
of peritonitis.

22:06.125 --> 22:08.595
Takes a while to develop.

22:08.595 --> 22:10.930
Steve.

22:10.930 --> 22:12.899
Hey, Steve.
Oh, Sammy...

22:12.899 --> 22:14.601
He's diaphoretic.
Barely has a pulse.

22:14.601 --> 22:17.637
Alright, two liters wide open.
Put him in trendelenberg.

22:17.637 --> 22:19.706
Can you get his cuffs off?!
Alright.

22:19.706 --> 22:22.675
Abdomen's rigid as a board.

22:22.675 --> 22:24.110
It was soft.
Pressure's 70 palp.

22:24.110 --> 22:26.145
He's going to need
a second I.V.

22:26.145 --> 22:28.415
Alright, give him
a gram of cefoxitin.

22:28.415 --> 22:30.417
You gonna take him
to the O.R.?

22:30.417 --> 22:33.052
If we get his pressure up.
He's septic. Mix up dopamine.

22:33.052 --> 22:35.755
Run a V-tach.
Okay, get the crash cart!

22:38.758 --> 22:40.092
Hey, how are you?

22:40.092 --> 22:42.429
I wasn't faking it.

22:42.429 --> 22:43.996
Yeah, I know.

22:43.996 --> 22:46.032
Hey, Rasgotra, Barney Fife here
wants to know

22:46.032 --> 22:48.601
how long you're going to be
detaining his detainee.

22:48.601 --> 22:50.570
I was thinking,
as long as possible?

22:50.570 --> 22:52.905
Yes, that will be correct.

22:58.811 --> 23:01.047
( phone rings )

23:01.047 --> 23:02.749
Yeah?

23:02.749 --> 23:05.752
BOBBY:
Been working pretty long hours,
Vic.

23:05.752 --> 23:07.119
Getting any sleep?

23:07.119 --> 23:08.621
Bobby, I'm not doing this.

23:08.621 --> 23:10.657
You hear me?
I'm not doing it, man!

23:10.657 --> 23:12.725
I been wanting
to talk to you.

23:12.725 --> 23:14.827
Even stopped by
to drop something off,

23:14.827 --> 23:16.863
but there was this
sheriff's van outside.

23:16.863 --> 23:18.965
What'd you do,
go and hire protection?

23:18.965 --> 23:20.833
I'm not playing your game.

23:20.833 --> 23:23.836
You hear me? I'm not playing
your little games.

23:23.836 --> 23:26.739
Okay. Calm down, buddy.
I'll let you go.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.207
Oh, and one last thing, though.

23:28.207 --> 23:30.677
What time you going home
tonight?

23:35.181 --> 23:36.215
Where's Dr. Lockhart?

23:36.215 --> 23:37.984
I would have
to check.

23:37.984 --> 23:40.152
Could you please tell her
Ruthie Pooler's here

23:40.152 --> 23:43.189
and I'll be in with my
grandmother, Exam Three?
Sure.

23:44.557 --> 23:46.025
Any word from
Social Services?

23:46.025 --> 23:48.060
I think Dr. Lockhart
called them,

23:48.060 --> 23:50.930
but no one's been down yet.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.165
It just I haven't been
getting any sleep lately.

23:53.165 --> 23:56.002
And the thing is that I've been
really, really needing some.

23:56.002 --> 23:57.837
Things have been
kind of rocky since

23:57.837 --> 23:59.038
Jody and all that.

23:59.038 --> 24:01.073
She okay?
Oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

24:01.073 --> 24:03.676
She's, she's great.
She's great.

24:03.676 --> 24:05.945
It's just...

24:05.945 --> 24:09.048
I'm just wondering can you write
me a scrip for some Ambien?

24:09.048 --> 24:11.150
Is herbal tea
not working?

24:11.150 --> 24:14.754
Ha, ha, very funny.
Did you ask your doctor?

24:14.754 --> 24:17.189
Docs don't have docs,
you know that.

24:20.827 --> 24:22.161
Abby, thank you.
Thank you.

24:22.161 --> 24:23.896
I really,
I really appreciate it.

24:23.896 --> 24:25.231
I really do.
Sure.

24:25.231 --> 24:26.666
What'd you give me, two?

24:26.666 --> 24:27.900
Is that it,
just two?

24:27.900 --> 24:29.035
Yeah. Tonight,
tomorrow night

24:29.035 --> 24:30.870
and I'm sure
by the next day

24:30.870 --> 24:32.905
you'll have your
very own primary
care physician.

24:32.905 --> 24:35.642
Hey, uh, Ruthie Pooler's back.
She's looking for you.

24:35.642 --> 24:37.076
She's in the room.
Thanks, Jerry.

24:37.076 --> 24:38.811
Come on, Abby,
you're killing me.

24:38.811 --> 24:42.715
Try those nature CDs,
birds chirping, waves crashing.

24:53.860 --> 24:56.028
I wasn't running away.

24:56.028 --> 25:00.600
I didn't think you were.

25:00.600 --> 25:04.904
I didn't think you would
leave your grandmother.

25:04.904 --> 25:06.573
Or your dog.

25:09.241 --> 25:12.779
Ruthie, believe me,

25:12.779 --> 25:16.783
I know it's not
going to be easy.

25:16.783 --> 25:18.818
Keys to my grandmother's car.

25:22.889 --> 25:25.191
"L" passes,
three months worth.

25:29.662 --> 25:33.032
Italian Cooking
Made Simple.

25:33.032 --> 25:36.135
Rachel Ray's
30-Minute Meals.

25:36.135 --> 25:38.304
Better Food For Dogs.

25:38.304 --> 25:42.008
This one's for Bob.

25:42.008 --> 25:43.976
This one's for us.

25:51.117 --> 25:54.821
I can do this,
Dr. Lockhart.

25:54.821 --> 25:57.123
We can do this.

26:03.796 --> 26:05.297
You know, for this to happen,

26:05.297 --> 26:08.167
Social Services is going
to have to follow up with you

26:08.167 --> 26:09.335
probably once a week.

26:09.335 --> 26:11.103
You're going to need

26:11.103 --> 26:13.372
home healthcare workers
probably every day.

26:13.372 --> 26:15.675
You said it wasn't going
to be easy.

26:21.648 --> 26:23.149
ER.

26:35.094 --> 26:37.329
Don't you ever pull
that crap on me again!

26:37.329 --> 26:40.332
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Last time I looked, I was right.

26:40.332 --> 26:42.769
You were lucky.

26:42.769 --> 26:44.403
A hypertensive patient
with a low crit

26:44.403 --> 26:46.238
and a positive ultrasound
always needs surgery.

26:46.238 --> 26:48.675
It was vasovagal, chronic anemia
and it was ascites.

26:48.675 --> 26:51.343
I saved your ass.
She could have bled to death!

26:51.343 --> 26:54.781
You would have sliced her open
on a table for no good reason!

26:57.149 --> 26:58.484
( gasping )

27:02.321 --> 27:03.355
Hey, Jerry.

27:03.355 --> 27:04.390
Olivia, how you doing?

27:04.390 --> 27:06.258
Where are we?

27:06.258 --> 27:08.695
Pick your poison. Trauma One or
Two.

27:08.695 --> 27:10.296
Thanks.
Uh, Dr. Pratt

27:10.296 --> 27:13.700
dropped this off for you before
he took off for the airport.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.376
They're lovely.

27:24.376 --> 27:28.047
Too bad they're not mine.

27:28.047 --> 27:31.784
(male on speakers) 'Good
afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
This is Captain Balisma..'

27:31.784 --> 27:33.019
Hey. Here you go.

27:33.019 --> 27:35.722
Thank you.

27:35.722 --> 27:37.323
Here you go, sir.
Vodka tonic.

27:37.323 --> 27:38.357
Thank you very much.

27:38.357 --> 27:41.260
You're welcome.

27:44.230 --> 27:46.198
How you doing?

27:49.435 --> 27:52.104
I'm Greg Pratt.

27:52.104 --> 27:54.974
Fatima Abakar.

27:54.974 --> 27:56.943
Nice name.

27:56.943 --> 27:59.411
So if you don't mind
me asking,

27:59.411 --> 28:01.814
what's taking you
to Khartoum?

28:01.814 --> 28:03.282
I live there.
Ah.

28:03.282 --> 28:06.819
Work for the government,
Ministry of Education.

28:06.819 --> 28:10.156
Wow. I'm a doctor.

28:10.156 --> 28:11.758
An emergency physician,
actually,

28:11.758 --> 28:14.360
and I'm on my way to Darfur
to do some work

28:14.360 --> 28:16.863
at one of the refugee camps.

28:16.863 --> 28:20.099
You mean IDP camp.

28:20.099 --> 28:22.234
They're not refugees,
they're IDPs--

28:22.234 --> 28:25.872
"internally displaced
persons."

28:25.872 --> 28:27.339
Right, right.

28:27.339 --> 28:30.777
Why?

28:30.777 --> 28:32.211
Why what?

28:32.211 --> 28:35.147
Why are you going?

28:35.147 --> 28:39.118
Um, I don't know.

28:39.118 --> 28:41.854
Something new, I guess.

28:41.854 --> 28:43.055
You know,
something different.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.792
And you've read up
on Darfur?

28:45.792 --> 28:48.060
Oh, yeah.

28:48.060 --> 28:51.330
It's a lot.

28:51.330 --> 28:54.801
Yeah, well,
I work in Chicago,

28:54.801 --> 28:57.436
a county ER,

28:57.436 --> 28:59.338
and I've treated
hundreds of gunshot wounds,

28:59.338 --> 29:02.374
knife wounds,
domestic violence.

29:02.374 --> 29:04.877
I think I know
my way around.

29:04.877 --> 29:07.914
AIDS, malaria,
dysentery.

29:07.914 --> 29:09.548
Two million people
homeless,

29:09.548 --> 29:14.320
not to mention the nearly
400,000 already slaughtered,

29:14.320 --> 29:18.190
boys, babies, tossed
onto bonfires,

29:18.190 --> 29:20.159
women and young girls raped,

29:20.159 --> 29:24.396
sometimes by men,
sometimes by bayonet.

29:24.396 --> 29:28.200
The work of gangs,
all things you have seen.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.336
But in Darfur,

29:30.336 --> 29:34.273
it's political and
on a massive scale.

29:34.273 --> 29:37.443
And while this insanity rages
on and on and on,

29:37.443 --> 29:40.279
the rest of the world continues
its debate--

29:40.279 --> 29:44.083
"Is it or is it not genocide?"

29:44.083 --> 29:48.554
This is not debate,
this is paralysis.

29:48.554 --> 29:50.389
Can you treat that, Dr. Pratt?

29:50.389 --> 29:53.259
Can you cure paralysis?

29:54.961 --> 29:58.330
( speaking Arabic )

29:58.330 --> 30:01.300
I don't speak Arabic,
only English.

30:10.376 --> 30:12.144
What, where are you working?

30:12.144 --> 30:14.914
Yeah, I'm going to work
in a refugee...

30:14.914 --> 30:17.316
an IDP camp, Dumtala.

30:17.316 --> 30:20.252
I'm a doctor.

30:20.252 --> 30:21.888
( speaks Arabic )

30:21.888 --> 30:23.289
( replies in Arabic )

30:23.289 --> 30:26.258
( speaks Arabic )

30:39.038 --> 30:41.140
Is there a problem?

30:41.140 --> 30:44.911
( The Beach Boys'
"California Girls" playing )

30:52.618 --> 30:54.853
Ibrahim, you're going
to run the battery down.

31:00.459 --> 31:03.229
Come on. We need you.

31:16.943 --> 31:18.244
Assalaam alaikum.

31:18.244 --> 31:19.578
Alaikum salaam.

31:19.578 --> 31:22.081
I was wondering if you
could help us, Mr...

31:22.081 --> 31:23.282
( speaking Arabic )

31:23.282 --> 31:25.417
Mudawi.

31:25.417 --> 31:28.554
Mr. Mudawi, we're here
to pick up that gentleman
right over there.

31:28.554 --> 31:32.058
It'd been easier if they had
someone who could speak English.

31:32.058 --> 31:35.061
Yeah, the whole
language thing,
very inconvenient.

31:35.061 --> 31:37.296
Giving me the third degree
over a paperback.

31:37.296 --> 31:39.031
They wanted
to confiscate it

31:39.031 --> 31:41.167
like it's the Nazi
master plan or something.

31:45.304 --> 31:48.240
Guess they don't put much money
into road work.

31:48.240 --> 31:51.110
I'm just going to assume
you're being facetious.

31:51.110 --> 31:53.379
Doesn't look like they put much
money into anything.

31:53.379 --> 31:56.082
Money's not the real currency
around here, Pratt.

31:56.082 --> 32:00.352
Life's about a little bit of
food, a little bit of firewood.

32:00.352 --> 32:03.555
Safety is the scarcest
resource of all.

32:03.555 --> 32:05.457
Well, it's hot as hell.

32:05.457 --> 32:07.994
Got any cold sodas or waters
in this cooler?

32:07.994 --> 32:09.195
Oxytocin,

32:09.195 --> 32:11.430
measles, Hep "B"
and tetanus vaccines.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.132
( sighs )

32:18.104 --> 32:20.206
( "I Got You, Babe" plays )

32:20.206 --> 32:23.075
* They say we're young
and we don't know *

32:23.075 --> 32:29.215
( hums ) * ...until we grow

32:29.215 --> 32:32.751
* Well, I don't know
if all that's true *

32:32.751 --> 32:36.522
* You got me, and baby,
I got you *

32:36.522 --> 32:39.225
I can't believe it,
we're in the middle of nowhere

32:39.225 --> 32:41.060
and this cat's got
Sonny and Cher.

32:41.060 --> 32:42.128
Ibrahim speaks
English, Pratt.

32:42.128 --> 32:43.562
* I got you babe

32:43.562 --> 32:47.233
Hey, sorry about that, man. How
you doing?

32:47.233 --> 32:49.268
* I got you babe

32:49.268 --> 32:52.504
* They say our love
won't pay the rent *

32:52.504 --> 32:55.507
* They say our love
won't pay the rent.. *

32:55.507 --> 32:58.444
Whoa, what the hell is that?

32:58.444 --> 33:00.379
Keep driving.
Slowly.

33:00.379 --> 33:02.348
Maybe they won't
stop us.

33:04.350 --> 33:06.118
Who are these guys?

33:06.118 --> 33:08.054
Janjaweed.

33:19.431 --> 33:22.401
( speaks Arabic )

33:26.738 --> 33:29.541
Don't do anything,
don't say anything.

33:33.312 --> 33:35.281
( speaking Arabic )

33:44.623 --> 33:47.193
( speaking Arabic )

33:47.193 --> 33:48.427
No, no, no!

33:49.495 --> 33:51.330
( speaks Arabic )

33:55.567 --> 33:57.336
It's okay.
No.

33:57.336 --> 33:59.438
I'm not leaving you.
He won't hurt me.

33:59.438 --> 34:00.772
I'm not leaving.

34:00.772 --> 34:02.474
( yells in Arabic )

34:02.474 --> 34:03.609
( speaks Arabic )

34:05.844 --> 34:09.148
( speaking Arabic )

34:09.148 --> 34:10.681
He's not Sudanese.

34:10.681 --> 34:13.752
He's an ex-pat doctor only here
to help, He has no gun.

34:13.752 --> 34:15.687
We're on our way
to Dumtala camp.

34:15.687 --> 34:17.656
Pratt tell him.
Pratt!
What?

34:17.656 --> 34:19.591
Tell him who you
are in English.

34:19.591 --> 34:21.293
Tell him!

34:21.293 --> 34:23.795
I'm a doctor,
we're all doctors.

34:23.795 --> 34:27.866
We're on our way
to the Dumtala camp
to help the sick people.

34:27.866 --> 34:30.335
We're not armed.
We have no guns.

34:30.335 --> 34:33.205
We're only here to help.

34:46.485 --> 34:48.487
( yells in Arabic )

34:59.798 --> 35:02.301
Okay, Ibrahim, let
me take a look, man.

35:03.835 --> 35:04.870
Ouch!

35:04.870 --> 35:06.272
Okay, okay, okay.

35:06.272 --> 35:08.174
Yep, it might be broken.

35:08.174 --> 35:10.342
No septal hematoma,
so you'll be okay.

35:10.342 --> 35:12.444
Just pinch it,
keep the pressure on.

35:12.444 --> 35:13.845
Ah!

35:17.649 --> 35:18.917
Radio's no good.

35:18.917 --> 35:21.187
Yeah, what a surprise.

35:26.192 --> 35:29.195
What are you looking
for, a phone booth?

35:29.195 --> 35:31.463
Who feels like walking?

35:37.303 --> 35:38.670
Mouthwash.

35:38.670 --> 35:40.672
You got to be
kidding me.

35:42.941 --> 35:45.211
You're a weird dude, Pratt.

35:50.716 --> 35:52.384
Ow.

35:56.655 --> 35:59.425
( grunts, groans ):
Ah.

37:41.660 --> 37:44.596
( baby crying )

37:48.066 --> 37:50.502
( crying )

37:52.438 --> 38:02.514
Shh...

38:02.514 --> 38:12.524
Shh...

38:30.642 --> 38:32.378
( loud groaning )

38:39.985 --> 38:41.086
You need some help?

38:41.086 --> 38:42.854
( yelling in Arabic )

38:42.854 --> 38:45.090
What? No, take it easy, relax.
I'm a doctor.

38:45.090 --> 38:46.625
Take it easy, rel... whoa!

38:47.993 --> 38:49.628
Sorry, sorry.

38:49.628 --> 38:52.030
Um... I'm a doctor.

38:52.030 --> 38:54.500
Do you speak English?
Do you need some help?

38:54.500 --> 38:56.968
Actually, I think it is you
that needs some help.

38:56.968 --> 39:00.038
I'm Steven Dakarai,
medical director here.

39:00.038 --> 39:02.541
Right.

39:02.541 --> 39:04.410
Nice to meet you,
I'm Greg Pratt.

39:04.410 --> 39:05.811
I know.

39:05.811 --> 39:09.548
I was trying to see
if I could do anything.

39:09.548 --> 39:10.682
The girl was raped.

39:10.682 --> 39:12.718
It is a custom here
that only women

39:12.718 --> 39:14.052
take care of those patients.

39:14.052 --> 39:16.488
But don't worry,
Zahra is an excellent nurse.

39:16.488 --> 39:17.723
She will handle it.
Yeah.

39:17.723 --> 39:18.757
Come.

39:18.757 --> 39:20.025
So...

39:20.025 --> 39:21.960
you just got here.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.995
And not easily I heard.

39:23.995 --> 39:27.065
Well, that's one way
of putting it.
( chuckles )

39:27.065 --> 39:30.502
The Janjaweed, generally
they do not hurt the doctors

39:30.502 --> 39:32.671
or the NGO workers.

39:32.671 --> 39:34.673
But one never knows
what might happen.

39:36.475 --> 39:38.143
You okay?

39:38.143 --> 39:40.178
I caught myself
a stomach virus.

39:40.178 --> 39:42.481
You must be careful
what you eat here.

39:42.481 --> 39:43.849
Here you go.

39:43.849 --> 39:45.884
That's the best
we could come up with.

39:45.884 --> 39:48.687
We don't have a
supply sergeant here.
Thank you.

39:48.687 --> 39:51.457
We will take up a collection
for you later.

39:51.457 --> 39:52.891
Dr. Carter,

39:52.891 --> 39:54.460
This young girl outside

39:54.460 --> 39:56.695
wants us to check her
grandmother in the camp.

39:56.695 --> 39:58.196
What's the problem?

39:58.196 --> 40:00.699
She's got vomiting and diarrhea,
too weak to walk.

40:00.699 --> 40:03.134
Hey, Greg.
Want to take a ten cent tour?

40:03.134 --> 40:04.770
Yeah, sure.
I'll be right out.

40:04.770 --> 40:06.805
I'd offer to come,
but these IV poles,

40:06.805 --> 40:08.840
they don't run so well
in the sand.

40:08.840 --> 40:11.209
Hey.
Hey.

40:11.209 --> 40:12.644
Hey, Pratt,

40:12.644 --> 40:13.779
how are your feet?

40:13.779 --> 40:14.946
Still working.

40:14.946 --> 40:17.816
See you later.

40:19.451 --> 40:20.986
So Debbie and Dakarai, huh?

40:20.986 --> 40:22.954
Yeah, they're an item.

40:26.224 --> 40:28.860
So tell me the news.
What's the news from County?

40:28.860 --> 40:31.763
Uh, well,
Susan Lewis left.

40:31.763 --> 40:34.099
She took a job over
in Iowa City.

40:34.099 --> 40:35.534
Yeah, I talked to her.

40:35.534 --> 40:37.168
She thinks she got
kind of screwed.

40:37.168 --> 40:39.805
She did. So now we got this guy
named Clemente.

40:39.805 --> 40:41.139
He's the new attending.

40:41.139 --> 40:43.041
Frank calls him
"Dr. Schizo."

40:43.041 --> 40:45.911
He's really not a bad
guy, he's just...

40:45.911 --> 40:47.913
I don't know,
a little nutty.

40:47.913 --> 40:49.681
And the R2s?

40:49.681 --> 40:51.583
Well, we're still keeping
our fingers crossed

40:51.583 --> 40:52.818
that they don't
kill anybody.

40:52.818 --> 40:55.186
Even Abby?

40:55.186 --> 40:58.023
She's always ahead
of the rest.

40:58.023 --> 41:01.493
Her and Kovac are
back together again.

41:03.094 --> 41:04.162
Really?

41:04.162 --> 41:05.764
( chuckles )

41:05.764 --> 41:08.166
Yeah, and they're
about to have a baby.

41:10.869 --> 41:14.039
Wow, that's news.

41:14.039 --> 41:16.875
That's great news.
I'm happy for them.

41:16.875 --> 41:19.110
Yeah, I'm going to have
to send them something.

41:19.110 --> 41:21.913
From here?
Good luck with that.

41:21.913 --> 41:24.550
( yelling )

41:28.654 --> 41:31.089
( yelling in Arabic )

41:31.089 --> 41:33.291
Ishaak, what happened?!

41:33.291 --> 41:35.761
He went too close to
the village by himself.

41:35.761 --> 41:37.262
They took him off his horse.

41:37.262 --> 41:39.931
( clamoring )

41:39.931 --> 41:41.633
( yelling )

41:41.633 --> 41:43.702
They're beating the hell
out of the guy.

41:43.702 --> 41:45.771
Stay back.
Pratt, let Ishaak
handle it.

41:51.109 --> 41:54.913
( yelling )

42:00.719 --> 42:02.754
( yelling )

42:12.163 --> 42:16.668
( yelling )

42:22.307 --> 42:24.175
( yelling )

43:02.247 --> 43:06.918
Is that vodka or gin?

43:06.918 --> 43:09.187
Something like that.

43:09.187 --> 43:11.857
Little green
food coloring...

43:11.857 --> 43:14.025
That's a good trick.

43:14.025 --> 43:15.861
Yeah, well...

43:15.861 --> 43:18.163
I'm a guy who really
knows his way around.

43:19.931 --> 43:22.033
( speaks Arabic )

43:24.235 --> 43:26.805
Welcome to Darfur.
