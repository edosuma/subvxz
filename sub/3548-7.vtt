WEBVTT

00:00.731 --> 00:02.001
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.001 --> 00:04.705
DANIELLE HAD HER BABY...

00:04.705 --> 00:06.507
...ON HALLOWEEN.

00:06.507 --> 00:09.280
YOU SAID MY FATHER
DIDN'T CARE ABOUT ME.

00:09.280 --> 00:11.011
KATHERINE REVEALED
A SECRET.

00:11.011 --> 00:13.344
I WANT YOU TO IMAGINE
THE WORST THING

00:13.344 --> 00:15.186
THAT A FATHER CAN DO
TO HIS DAUGHTER.

00:15.186 --> 00:17.148
LYNETTE GOT GREAT NEWS.

00:17.148 --> 00:19.220
I GOT THE TEST RESULTS BACK.
YOU'RE CLEAN.

00:19.220 --> 00:22.153
WHILE MIKE TRIED TO EASE
HIS PAIN,

00:22.153 --> 00:25.025
VICTOR...
 YOU KNOW WHAT MY DREAM IS?

00:25.025 --> 00:28.159
...REACHED OUT TO GABY.
 YOU.

00:28.159 --> 00:30.361
DON'T RUN AWAY, GABY.
BUT IF YOU DO, TAKE ME WITH YOU.

00:30.361 --> 00:34.205
AND EDIE GOT REVENGE.

00:34.205 --> 00:35.766
DON'T TAKE IT ALL
OUT ON GABY.

00:35.766 --> 00:38.339
CARLOS DECIDED TO MAKE
A FOOL OUT OF YOU.

00:44.145 --> 00:47.148
(Mary Alice) THE THING YOU NEED
TO KNOW ABOUT VICTOR LANG

00:47.148 --> 00:50.081
IS THAT HE WAS NOT ABOVE
USING DECEPTION.

00:50.081 --> 00:52.553
WHETHER IT WAS
AN INSINCERE PROMISE

00:52.553 --> 00:55.086
TO A CAMPAIGN DONOR,

00:55.086 --> 00:59.360
OR THE ARTFUL EVASION
OF A REPORTER'S QUESTION,

00:59.360 --> 01:03.494
OR AN OUTRIGHT LIE
TO HIS CONSTITUENTS,

01:03.494 --> 01:07.198
VICTOR DID WHAT HE HAD TO
TO GET WHAT HE WANTED.

01:07.198 --> 01:11.202
BUT THANKS
TO SOME COMPROMISING PHOTOS,

01:11.202 --> 01:13.073
HE LEARNED THAT HIS WIFE

01:13.073 --> 01:16.377
KNEW A LITTLE SOMETHING
ABOUT DECEPTION AS WELL.

01:16.377 --> 01:19.350
(door shuts)

01:19.350 --> 01:21.352
(cell phone rings)

01:23.854 --> 01:25.216
(ring)

01:25.216 --> 01:26.317
(sighs)

01:26.317 --> 01:28.819
FOR THE LAST TIME, CARLOS,
STOP CALLING ME.

01:28.819 --> 01:31.192
I TOLD YOU,
I JUST WANNA TALK.

01:31.192 --> 01:33.294
AND I TOLD YOU IT'S OVER.
 SO WHAT,

01:33.294 --> 01:36.327
YOU'RE JUST GONNA GO BACK
TO THAT CHICKEN-LIPPED ALBINO?
 I don't know.

01:36.327 --> 01:38.829
I'M TAKING IT
ONE DAY AT A TIME.

01:38.829 --> 01:41.332
BUT WHAT I CAN SAY
ABOUT VICTOR IS

01:41.332 --> 01:45.176
HE DOESN'T LIE TO ME
ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY HE'S GOT.
 Look, I said I was sorry.

01:45.176 --> 01:49.180
OH, THAT'S GREAT.
YEAH, WELL, I-I GOTTA GO, BREE.

01:49.180 --> 01:50.381
(beep)
 AHEM.

01:50.381 --> 01:51.682
IT'S BREE.

01:53.184 --> 01:55.846
OKAY, SO I JUST
INFORMED MY STAFF

01:55.846 --> 01:57.848
THAT I'M TAKING
THE NEXT MONTH OFF

01:57.848 --> 02:00.391
TO GIVE MY WIFE THE HONEYMOON
SHE ALWAYS WANTED.

02:00.391 --> 02:04.195
THAT'S AMAZING.
WHERE SHOULD WE GO?
 WELL, I LEFT SOME
TRAVEL MAGAZINES IN THE BEDROOM.

02:04.195 --> 02:06.557
WHY DON'T YOU GO GET 'EM?
 OH!

02:12.463 --> 02:13.904
(beep)

02:18.469 --> 02:20.241
OH, MY GOD, VICTOR.

02:20.241 --> 02:23.644
A MONTH IN RIO
SOUNDS LIKE HEAVEN, DOESN'T IT?

02:23.644 --> 02:27.178
OH, IT DOES. LET'S DO IT.
 OOH!

02:27.178 --> 02:29.480
HEY, WHY DON'T WE KICK OFF
OUR RECONCILIATION

02:29.480 --> 02:31.852
WITH A LITTLE WEEKEND
ON THE BOAT?

02:31.852 --> 02:34.325
THAT'S SO ROMANTIC.
I LOVE THAT.
 HUH?

02:34.325 --> 02:37.588
JUST YOU AND ME, ALL ALONE,
OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN.

02:37.588 --> 02:39.660
THE GIRLS
ARE GONNA BE SO JEALOUS.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.663
OH, NO, NO, NO, LET'S NOT
TELL ANYONE WE'RE GOING.

02:42.663 --> 02:45.436
IT'LL BE OUR LITTLE SECRET.

02:45.436 --> 02:48.168
YES,
VICTOR WAS NOT ABOVE

02:48.168 --> 02:50.841
USING DECEPTION
TO GET WHAT HE WANTED,

02:50.841 --> 02:53.444
AND WHAT HE WANTED NOW

02:53.444 --> 03:08.289
WAS REVENGE.

03:08.289 --> 03:12.863
THE NEXT DAY ON WISTERIA LANE
BEGAN WITH A BIT OF DECEIT.

03:12.863 --> 03:14.525
(baby crying)

03:14.525 --> 03:16.527
BREE HODGE TOLD HER FRIENDS

03:16.527 --> 03:19.530
SHE HAD GIVEN BIRTH
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

03:19.530 --> 03:21.201
TO A BEAUTIFUL BABY BOY.

03:21.201 --> 03:24.435
AND THANKS TO THE HEALTHY LUNGS
OF BENJAMIN TYSON HODGE,

03:24.435 --> 03:27.408
IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG
FOR BREE'S FRIENDS

03:27.408 --> 03:29.910
TO ENGAGE IN SOME DECEIT
OF THEIR OWN.

03:29.910 --> 03:33.484
(crying continues)
 WELL, HE'S JUST
A LITTLE PIECE OF HEAVEN.

03:33.484 --> 03:37.918
YOU'RE SO BLESSED.
 MAKES ME WANNA
HAVE ANOTHER ONE MYSELF.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.920
ORSON, YOU BETTER TAKE BENJAMIN
TO THE OTHER ROOM

03:39.920 --> 03:42.753
BEFORE MY FRIENDS
RUN OUT OF LIES.
 (Orson) AH.

03:42.753 --> 03:44.325
NO. (chuckles)

03:44.325 --> 03:47.258
THEY DON'T APPRECIATE A HEALTHY
PAIR OF LUNGS, THAT'S ALL, HUH?

03:47.258 --> 03:49.260
SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH.
 COME ON, BENJAMIN.

03:49.260 --> 03:52.263
HEY, LYNETTE,
YOU TELL EVERYONE YOUR NEWS?
 NO. THIS IS ABOUT THE BABY.

03:52.263 --> 03:54.605
WAIT. DID YOU HAVE
THAT FINAL SCAN?

03:54.605 --> 03:56.937
DID YOU HEAR SOMETHING?
 WELL, THE RESULTS ARE BACK,

03:56.937 --> 03:59.340
AND WHILE YOU CAN NEVER
ACTUALLY SAY YOU'RE CURED--

03:59.340 --> 04:01.412
SHE'S CURED!
 (women gasp and scream)

04:01.412 --> 04:04.375
OH, MY GOD!
 OH, YEAH! (laughs)

04:04.375 --> 04:06.477
I HAVE TO GET CHECKED
EVERY SIX MONTHS,

04:06.477 --> 04:09.350
BUT, YES, THE DOCTOR
IS VERY OPTIMISTIC.

04:09.350 --> 04:11.322
HEY, WHAT THE HELL
IS ALL THIS RACKET?

04:11.322 --> 04:13.324
SOMEONE WIN THE LOTTO?

04:13.324 --> 04:16.857
OH, I WAS JUST TELLING EVERYBODY
THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT MY...

04:18.529 --> 04:20.029
CANCER.

04:20.029 --> 04:22.433
HEY, CONGRATS!

04:22.433 --> 04:24.435
I'M A SURVIVOR MYSELF.

04:24.435 --> 04:25.596
PROSTATE.

04:25.596 --> 04:26.937
OOH, MUFFINS.

04:26.937 --> 04:29.400
HEY, SHOW SOME CLASS.
INTRODUCE YOURSELF.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.271
HI. I'M STAN.

04:34.445 --> 04:36.447
IS TH--IS THAT MY ROBE?

04:36.447 --> 04:39.009
YEAH. SORRY, UH...

04:39.009 --> 04:42.012
IF I KNEW WHEN I WALKED
INTO THAT CARD CLUB LAST NIGHT

04:42.012 --> 04:45.015
THAT I WOULD BE GOING HOME
WITH THIS LOVELY LADY,

04:45.015 --> 04:48.288
I'D HAVE PACKED ME
A CHANGE OF CLOTHES.

04:49.920 --> 04:54.395
OKAY, I GET IT.
WE'LL GET OUT OF YOUR HAIR.

04:54.395 --> 04:56.697
COME ON, HANDSOME.
LET'S TAKE A SHOWER.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.669
(gasps) OOH.

05:03.674 --> 05:06.377
(Susan) MIKE,
HOW LONG ARE YOU GONNA BE?

05:06.377 --> 05:09.380
WE'VE GOTTA GET THIS FOOD OVER
TO BREE'S BEFORE IT GETS COLD.

05:09.380 --> 05:12.683
YOU KNOW, SUSAN, I DON'T FEEL
LIKE GOING OVER THERE TONIGHT.

05:12.683 --> 05:15.686
CAN'T YOU JUST DROP IT OFF?
 NO, THEY JUST HAD A BABY.

05:15.686 --> 05:19.390
WE'RE GONNA "OOH," WE'RE GONNA
"AHH," AND THEN WE'RE GONNA EAT.
 BUT I'M TIRED.

05:19.390 --> 05:23.394
I WORKED ALL DAY. I GOT A JOB
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

05:23.394 --> 05:25.396
THERE'S NO WAY
OUT OF IT, MIKE.

05:25.396 --> 05:30.401
THIS IS WHAT WE DO
IN THE SUBURBS.

05:30.401 --> 05:31.702
(sighs)

05:33.003 --> 05:35.366
(pills rattle)

05:35.366 --> 05:37.638
AH, YES...

05:37.638 --> 05:39.470
(mouth full) THE SUBURBS.

05:42.342 --> 05:45.716
AND HOW DOES DANIELLE LIKE
HER BABY BROTHER?

05:45.716 --> 05:47.578
OH, SHE ADORES HIM.

05:47.578 --> 05:50.581
SHE JUST FELT TERRIBLE THAT SHE
HAD TO LEAVE FOR SCHOOL SO SOON.

05:50.581 --> 05:51.982
MM...
 MM.

05:51.982 --> 05:55.085
SPEAKING OF WHICH, WE HAVE SOME
EXTRA PRESCHOOL APPLICATIONS

05:55.085 --> 05:56.857
IF THE TWO OF YOU
ARE INTERESTED.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.390
ISN'T IT A LITTLE EARLY
TO BE TALKING PRESCHOOL?

05:59.390 --> 06:02.433
SHE JUST GOT PREGNANT. OUR BABY
STILL LOOKS LIKE A SEA HORSE.
 OH, HONEY.

06:02.433 --> 06:05.135
YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW FAST
THE BEST SCHOOLS FILL UP.

06:05.135 --> 06:07.137
AND ONLY THE BEST
FOR OUR KID, RIGHT?

06:07.137 --> 06:09.670
I'D START SAVING YOUR PENNIES.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.972
BONNY BRIAR'S
UP TO $10,000 A YEAR.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.143
10,000DOLLARS...

06:13.143 --> 06:16.477
FOR USED LEGOS
AND A POTTY CHAIR?

06:16.477 --> 06:18.779
(chuckles)
 AND YOU'D BETTER APPLY NOW.

06:18.779 --> 06:22.483
DEBBIE GOTTLIEB HAD HER BABY
THE SAME DAY I DID,

06:22.483 --> 06:24.485
AND SHE COULD
ONLY GET WAIT-LISTED

06:24.485 --> 06:25.956
AT HER FIRST THREE CHOICES.

06:25.956 --> 06:28.959
OH, BY THE WAY, WE WERE INVITED
TO HER BRIS THIS SATURDAY.

06:28.959 --> 06:31.962
WELL, MAKE AN EXCUSE FOR ME.
 I THOUGHT YOU LIKED
DEBBIE AND LOU.

06:31.962 --> 06:33.464
OH, I DO.

06:33.464 --> 06:36.997
I JUST DON'T CARE TO WATCH THEM
RITUALLY MUTILATE THEIR CHILD.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.799
MORE MOO SHU, PLEASE.

06:38.799 --> 06:40.471
CIRCUMCISION'S
NOT MUTILATION.

06:40.471 --> 06:42.132
IT'S A SIMPLE SURGERY

06:42.132 --> 06:44.535
MEANT TO PROMOTE
LIFELONG MASCULINE HYGIENE.

06:44.535 --> 06:46.637
IT'S A, UH,
TRAUMATIC PROCEDURE

06:46.637 --> 06:49.139
WHICH REDUCES THE MALE'S
CAPACITY FOR SEXUAL PLEASURE

06:49.139 --> 06:51.141
BY DESENSITIZING
THE TIP OF--

06:51.141 --> 06:53.444
WE KNOW WHAT IT IS.

06:54.815 --> 06:57.518
GEE, I DON'T THINK
I'VE EVER HEARD

06:57.518 --> 07:01.421
SUCH STRONG OPINIONS
ON THE SUBJECT.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.424
I MEAN, NOT THAT IT'S SOMETHING
I TALK ABOUT A LOT...

07:04.424 --> 07:05.856
OR EVER.

07:05.856 --> 07:08.128
I HOPE
I DIDN'T OFFEND YOU.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.961
I HAVEN'T HEARD A WORD
SINCE "$10,000."

07:10.961 --> 07:12.533
(chuckles)

07:12.533 --> 07:15.706
IT'S JUST THAT I REMEMBER
MY OWN CIRCUMCISION SO VIVIDLY.

07:18.509 --> 07:20.140
(laughs)
OH, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.773
MY PARENTS DISAGREED
ON THIS ISSUE, TOO.

07:22.773 --> 07:24.475
MY DAD SAID NO.

07:24.475 --> 07:27.117
SO MOTHER
JUST BIDED HER TIME

07:27.117 --> 07:29.480
UNTIL HE FINALLY
LEFT TOWN ON BUSINESS.

07:29.480 --> 07:31.151
I WAS 5.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.053
WHOA.
 OUCH.

07:33.053 --> 07:37.528
SHE TOLD ME
WE WERE GOING FOR ICE CREAM.

07:38.829 --> 07:41.532
THAT'S WHY THE PROCEDURE
SHOULD BE DONE ON BABIES.

07:41.532 --> 07:42.833
THEY WON'T REMEMBER.

07:42.833 --> 07:45.896
NOW CAN WE PLEASE
JUST DROP THIS?

07:45.896 --> 07:47.598
FINE.
 (crunch)

07:49.500 --> 07:51.572
SO, SUSAN,

07:51.572 --> 07:53.904
YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING
ABOUT BRINGING DESSERT.

07:53.904 --> 07:55.606
WHAT IS IT?

07:55.606 --> 07:57.648
UM...

07:57.648 --> 07:58.949
ICE CREAM.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.112
SORRY.

08:07.257 --> 08:09.890
OH, SO YOU FOUND
THE CHOCOLATE SAUCE?

08:09.890 --> 08:12.663
OH, UH, YEAH,
IT'S RIGHT HERE.

08:12.663 --> 08:16.026
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
 OH, YEAH. I WAS JUST TAKING
A COUPLE OF ASPIRIN.

08:16.026 --> 08:18.869
I HOPE ORSON'S RANT
DIDN'T GIVE YOU A HEADACHE.

08:18.869 --> 08:21.001
OH, NO, I'VE JUST STILL GOT
A LITTLE PAIN FROM MY ACCIDENT,

08:21.001 --> 08:23.574
THAT'S ALL.
 STILL? THAT WAS NEARLY
TWO YEARS AGO.

08:23.574 --> 08:25.776
WELL, IT'S JUST A TWINGE
EVERY NOW AND THEN.

08:25.776 --> 08:27.778
ASPIRIN DOES THE TRICK.

08:42.292 --> 08:44.524
(Victor) NO, NO, NO, NO.
I'LL GET THAT.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.527
I THOUGHT YOU KEPT YOUR BOAT
AT THE YACHT CLUB.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.860
YEAH, I WANTED
TO LEAVE FROM HERE.

08:49.860 --> 08:53.263
THIS WAY, WE AVOID
THE CONGESTION AT THE MARINA.
 WHERE'S THE CREW?

08:53.263 --> 08:55.566
THERE'S NO CREW.
I LET 'EM GO.

08:55.566 --> 08:56.737
WHAT?

08:56.737 --> 08:58.739
WHO'S GONNA BRING US
UMBRELLA DRINKS

08:58.739 --> 09:00.871
AND SALUTE US
WHEN WE WALK BY?

09:00.871 --> 09:03.173
JUST CONSIDER ME
YOUR ONE-MAN NAVY.

09:03.173 --> 09:06.216
SO YOU'RE GONNA
DRIVE THIS THING BY YOURSELF?
 WELL, YOU CAN HELP.

09:06.216 --> 09:08.679
DIDN'T THAT CAPTAIN
GIVE YOU LESSONS LAST SUMMER?

09:08.679 --> 09:10.681
OH, THAT'S RIGHT--

09:10.681 --> 09:12.783
THOSE TWO BORING HOURS
I'LL NEVER GET BACK.

09:12.783 --> 09:16.657
WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS THIS TRIP
WILL BE ANYTHING BUT BORING.

09:32.703 --> 09:33.674
HEY.

09:33.674 --> 09:34.905
HI.

09:34.905 --> 09:38.308
WE NEED TO TALK
ABOUT THIS STAN THING.

09:38.308 --> 09:41.712
OH, IS THAT HIS NAME?
STAN?

09:41.712 --> 09:45.355
UH, WHEN HE LEFT,
I JUST SORT OF SAID, "SEE YA."

09:45.355 --> 09:47.357
WELL,
IT GOT ME THINKING

09:47.357 --> 09:50.590
ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU'VE HAD
TO PUT YOUR LIFE ON HOLD

09:50.590 --> 09:53.193
THESE PAST FEW MONTHS.
 NO BIG DEAL.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.195
NO, ITWASA BIG DEAL.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.197
YOU HAVE TAKEN
AMAZING CARE OF ME.

09:57.197 --> 10:00.030
BUT I KNOW YOU HAVE SO MANY
THINGS YOU WANNA GET BACK TO.

10:00.030 --> 10:01.902
MM, NOT REALLY.

10:01.902 --> 10:04.604
COME ON.
IT MUST BE DRIVING YOU CRAZY

10:04.604 --> 10:06.606
LIVING WITH FIVE SCREAMING KIDS
UNDERFOOT.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.810
I DON'T BLAME YOU FOR WANTING
A LITTLE PEACE AND QUIET.

10:11.742 --> 10:14.645
(sighs) YOU NEED TO LEAVE,
MOM.

10:14.645 --> 10:15.816
OKAY.

10:15.816 --> 10:18.689
OKAY, I-I KNOW
I SHOULDN'T HAVE BROUGHT...

10:18.689 --> 10:20.150
STAN INTO THE HOUSE.

10:20.150 --> 10:23.794
AND NEXT TIME, I PROMISE YOU
WE WILL DO IT IN THE CAR.

10:23.794 --> 10:26.156
IT'S NOT JUST THAT.

10:26.156 --> 10:28.628
IT'S THE SMOKING
AND THE SWEARING

10:28.628 --> 10:31.631
AND THE TEACHING THE KIDS
HOW TO MAKE A WHISKEY SOUR.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.704
IT'S A SCIENCE, LYNETTE.

10:33.704 --> 10:35.806
IT'S CALLED MIXOLOGY.

10:35.806 --> 10:37.868
I JUST THINK IT WOULD
WORK BETTER FOR EVERYONE

10:37.868 --> 10:39.870
IF YOU GOT YOUR OWN PLACE.

10:39.870 --> 10:42.242
OKAY. WITH WHAT MONEY?

10:42.242 --> 10:44.244
YOU HAVE MONEY, RIGHT?

10:44.244 --> 10:46.977
I MEAN, YOU LOANED US
THAT $10,000.

10:46.977 --> 10:50.320
YES, I DID.

10:50.320 --> 10:52.152
WAIT A MINUTE.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.654
THAT WAS ALL THE MONEY
YOU HAD?

10:54.654 --> 10:57.657
YOU GUYS NEEDED IT,
AND I NEEDED A PLACE TO STAY.

10:57.657 --> 11:00.390
IT SEEMED LIKE IT TURNED OUT
PRETTY WELL FOR EVERYBODY.

11:00.390 --> 11:03.694
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I THOUGHT
YOU WERE LIVING WITH LUCY.

11:03.694 --> 11:05.866
YOUR SISTER KICKED ME OUT.

11:05.866 --> 11:09.700
NOT TO PUT TOO FINE
A POINT ON IT, LYNETTE,

11:09.700 --> 11:12.973
BUT YOUR CANCER COULDN'T
HAVE COME AT A BETTER TIME.

11:15.075 --> 11:18.678
HEY, I NEED YOUR HELP
WITH A SCHOOL THING.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.381
WOW. YOU NEVER ASK FOR MY HELP.
MUST BE SOMETHING EASY.

11:21.381 --> 11:24.014
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT DYLAN'S DAD?

11:24.014 --> 11:26.686
WE'VE GOT THIS GENEALOGY PROJECT
FOR SCHOOL,

11:26.686 --> 11:29.259
AND SHE WANTS
TO FIND OUT ABOUT HIM.

11:29.259 --> 11:32.192
MAYBE DYLAN
SHOULD ASK HER MOM.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.224
SHE GETS REALLY WEIRD
TALKING ABOUT HIM.

11:34.224 --> 11:36.226
WHY IS THAT, BY THE WAY?

11:36.226 --> 11:39.199
OKAY, DON'T TELL ANYBODY
I TOLD YOU THIS.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.802
HER MOM SAID SOMETHING
AT MY PARTY

11:41.802 --> 11:44.104
ABOUT HER DAD BEING ABUSIVE
TOWARDS KATHERINE...

11:44.104 --> 11:45.806
AND MAYBE DYLAN, TOO.

11:45.806 --> 11:48.438
OH.
 SO I'M THINKING
THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER

11:48.438 --> 11:52.082
IF YOU COULD GET HER TO RESEARCH
SOMEBODY ELSE IN HER FAMILY.

11:52.082 --> 11:53.814
YEAH.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.746
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:58.248 --> 12:00.821
LISTEN, I-I WAS
TALKING TO MY MOM, AND--

12:00.821 --> 12:03.393
YEAH.

12:03.393 --> 12:04.724
I HEARD.

12:11.301 --> 12:14.304
(beeping)

12:16.506 --> 12:19.870
SUSAN? HI. IT'S, UH, BREE.
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HOME.

12:19.870 --> 12:23.774
UH, LISTEN, I-I THOUGHT I MIGHT
STOP BY FOR A LITTLE VISIT.

12:26.016 --> 12:27.377
HEY.

12:27.377 --> 12:30.480
LOOK, I'VE ONLY GOT, UH, ABOUT
AN HOUR BEFORE MY NEXT JOB.

12:30.480 --> 12:33.483
UH, IS IT OKAY IF I GRAB LUNCH
IN FRONT OF THE TV?

12:33.483 --> 12:36.887
I WANTED TO WATCH THE GAME.
 OH, SURE.
I'LL--I'LL BRING UP A TRAY.

12:36.887 --> 12:39.129
OH, THANKS.

12:39.129 --> 12:41.261
BREE THINKS
YOU'RE DOING DRUGS.

12:42.963 --> 12:46.336
SHE FOUND THIS
ON HER KITCHEN FLOOR,

12:46.336 --> 12:47.998
AND IT'S NOT ASPIRIN.

12:47.998 --> 12:51.001
WELL, YOU KNOW, MY SHOULDER'S
BEEN HURTING LATELY.

12:51.001 --> 12:53.773
SHE SAYS IT'S A NARCOTIC,
AND IT'S HIGHLY ADDICTIVE.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.245
GIVEN YOUR HISTORY--

12:55.245 --> 12:57.347
WHOA, WHOA, SUSAN, THESE--THESE
WERE PRESCRIBED BY A DOCTOR

12:57.347 --> 12:59.009
RIGHT AFTER MY ACCIDENT.

12:59.009 --> 13:01.812
I FOUND A COUPLE
IN THE MEDICINE CABINET,

13:01.812 --> 13:04.084
AND I'VE BEEN
CARRYING 'EM AROUND

13:04.084 --> 13:06.786
IN CASE MY SHOULDER ACTS UP.
 REALLY?

13:06.786 --> 13:08.859
YEAH. (laughs) REALLY.
THEY WERE THE LAST TWO.

13:08.859 --> 13:10.821
SO YOU GOT NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

13:10.821 --> 13:13.824
OH, THANK GOD! (laughs) YOU HAVE
NO IDEA WHERE MY MIND WENT.

13:13.824 --> 13:16.967
I HAD YOU ROAMING BACK ALLEYS
TO SCORE YOUR DOPE,

13:16.967 --> 13:19.799
PAWNING OUR GOOD SILVER
TO PAY YOUR DEALER.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.801
AND WE DON'T EVEN HAVE
GOOD SILVER,

13:21.801 --> 13:24.804
SO IT GOT WORSE 'CAUSE YOU
HAD TO KNOCK OVER A GAS STATION

13:24.804 --> 13:26.877
TO BUY THE SILVER
TO PAWN IT OFF.

13:26.877 --> 13:28.879
I WAS REALLY
MAKING MYSELF CRAZY.

13:28.879 --> 13:30.340
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

13:30.340 --> 13:32.342
BUT I REITERATE--
OLD PILL, NO PROBLEM.

13:32.342 --> 13:35.315
I KNEW IT. I'M SO HAPPY.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.947
MMM.
 GOOD.

13:36.947 --> 13:38.949
MM, NOW FIX ME SOME LUNCH,
WOMAN.
 (slaps behind)

13:38.949 --> 13:41.291
OH! (chuckles)
 I WANNA WATCH THE DAMN GAME.

13:43.854 --> 13:45.856
(woman speaks indistinctly
over P.A.)

13:45.856 --> 13:47.858
CAN I HELP YOU?

13:47.858 --> 13:51.461
YES, UM, CAN YOU TELL ME
WHO I WOULD TALK TO

13:51.461 --> 13:54.034
ABOUT HAVING MY BABY
CIRCUMCISED?

13:54.034 --> 13:56.836
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU CAN'T HELP ME?

13:56.836 --> 14:01.011
I RECEIVED A REGISTERED LETTER
FROM YOUR HUSBAND WHICH READS,

14:01.011 --> 14:04.014
"I DO NOT WISH FOR MY SON,
BENJAMIN HODGE,

14:04.014 --> 14:05.545
"TO BE CIRCUMCISED.

14:05.545 --> 14:08.418
SHOULD THE RECIPIENT OF THIS
LETTER ENCOUNTER MY WIFE..."

14:08.418 --> 14:10.420
"PLEASE FEEL FREE
TO SHOW HER THIS LETTER

14:10.420 --> 14:12.452
"AND ASSURE HER
OF ITS WIDE DISTRIBUTION

14:12.452 --> 14:14.624
"TO HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIANS

14:14.624 --> 14:17.227
ACROSS THIS
AND TWO NEIGHBORING STATES."

14:17.227 --> 14:21.031
DOES THIS SEEM TOO WARM
TO YOU?
 THAT YOU EVEN FELT
SUCH A THING WAS NECESSARY.

14:21.031 --> 14:24.634
WELL, OBVIOUSLY, IT WAS.
FORGIVE ME FOR KNOWING MY WIFE.

14:24.634 --> 14:27.867
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
YOU DON'T TRUST ME?

14:27.867 --> 14:29.869
I TRUST YOU
NOT TO BREAK YOUR WORD.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.242
SINCE YOU'VE POINTEDLY
REFUSED TO GIVE IT,

14:32.242 --> 14:35.375
I TRUSTED YOU TO SNIP FIRST
AND DEBATE THE MERITS LATER.

14:35.375 --> 14:38.949
I'M ONLY THINKING OF BENJAMIN.
BE REASONABLE.

14:38.949 --> 14:40.580
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S UNREASONABLE.

14:40.580 --> 14:43.083
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
AGAINST UNTRIMMED PENISES?

14:43.083 --> 14:45.555
THEY'RE... UNSIGHTLY.

14:45.555 --> 14:46.957
(scoffs)

14:46.957 --> 14:49.619
I DO NOT WANT OUR SON
TO BE TEASED...

14:49.619 --> 14:51.261
(sighs) FOR BEING DIFFERENT.
DO YOU?

14:51.261 --> 14:53.093
AH, SO IN THE END,

14:53.093 --> 14:55.595
IT ALL COMES DOWN
TO TRADITION AND CONFORMITY.

14:55.595 --> 14:59.099
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT?
I THOUGHT WE LIKED CONFORMITY.

14:59.099 --> 15:03.974
NOT AT THE PRICE OF PAIN
AND REDUCED SEXUAL PLEASURE.

15:03.974 --> 15:06.476
I CAN TELL YOU SOMEONE
WHOSE SEXUAL PLEASURE

15:06.476 --> 15:08.979
IS GOING TO BE REDUCED
BIG-TIME!

15:10.910 --> 15:12.212
HEY, SWEETHEART.

15:12.212 --> 15:14.214
(typing on keyboard)

15:14.214 --> 15:16.016
WHAT'S THAT?

15:16.016 --> 15:18.188
JUST SOMETHING FOR SCHOOL.

15:20.991 --> 15:23.293
WHAT WAS THAT NAME
YOU JUST TYPED IN?

15:25.195 --> 15:27.197
WE WERE ASSIGNED
A GENEALOGY PROJECT.

15:27.197 --> 15:30.560
I HAVE TO DO RESEARCH
ON MY FATHER.

15:30.560 --> 15:32.232
I WILL CALL YOUR TEACHER.

15:32.232 --> 15:35.935
SHE'LL ASSIGN YOU
A DIFFERENT PROJECT.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.937
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

15:37.937 --> 15:40.070
I AM LEARNING
ABOUT MY FATHER.

15:41.371 --> 15:42.512
(gasps)

15:42.512 --> 15:44.714
DYLAN!
 FOR YEARS, YOU HAVE TOLD ME

15:44.714 --> 15:47.417
THAT MY FATHER
IS TOO EVIL TO TALK ABOUT.

15:47.417 --> 15:49.719
NOW I FIND OUT
YOU'VE DISCUSSED HIM

15:49.719 --> 15:51.421
AT A NEIGHBORHOOD GAME NIGHT?!

15:51.421 --> 15:55.285
REGARDLESS,
I AM STILL YOUR MOTHER,

15:55.285 --> 15:57.287
AND WHILE
YOU'RE UNDER MY ROOF,

15:57.287 --> 15:59.289
YOU WILL OBEY MY RULES.

15:59.289 --> 16:01.661
AND WHAT IF I DON'T?

16:01.661 --> 16:05.195
ARE YOU GONNA SLAP ME AGAIN,
KICK ME OUT OF THE HOUSE?

16:05.195 --> 16:08.268
GO AHEAD. TRY IT.
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

16:08.268 --> 16:11.041
I'M SORRY, MOM.

16:11.041 --> 16:13.143
YOU CAN'T STOP ME
THIS TIME.

16:15.205 --> 16:18.978
I AM OFFICIALLY
NO LONGER AFRAID OF YOU.

16:32.122 --> 16:34.424
AND HE NEEDED SOMETHING FOR
THE PAIN, SO HE HAPPENED TO FIND

16:34.424 --> 16:36.666
THE LAST TWO PILLS
IN THE MEDICINE CABINET,

16:36.666 --> 16:37.997
AND HE TOOK 'EM.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.330
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

16:40.330 --> 16:43.103
(sighs deeply)
LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

16:43.103 --> 16:45.335
YOU SEE THIS BREADMAKER?

16:45.335 --> 16:47.337
THIS IS WHERE I HID
A BOTTLE OF CHARDONNAY

16:47.337 --> 16:49.739
AFTER I TOLD EVERYONE
I'D STOPPED DRINKING.

16:49.739 --> 16:52.512
OH, BUT THIS ISN'T
THE SAME THING.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.544
MIKE WOULDN'T LIE TO ME
ABOUT THIS.

16:54.544 --> 16:56.146
OH!

16:56.146 --> 16:58.188
AND THIS ROTATING SPICE RACK?

16:58.188 --> 17:01.121
THOSE LITTLE AIRPLANE BOTTLES
OF VODKA

17:01.121 --> 17:03.423
FIT PERFECTLY IN THE BACK.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.655
HE SAID
THERE WERE NO MORE PILLS.

17:05.655 --> 17:07.627
I WAS LOOKING HIM
IN THE EYE.

17:07.627 --> 17:11.531
SUSAN, ADDICTS ARE EXPERTS
AT DECEPTION.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.363
MY ADVICE TO YOU--

17:13.363 --> 17:17.207
TRUST...

17:17.207 --> 17:18.708
BUT VERIFY.

17:34.584 --> 17:36.556
(clicks flashlight button)

17:36.556 --> 17:38.057
(clicks button)

17:41.831 --> 17:43.163
(sighs)

17:47.167 --> 17:48.838
(clicking button)

17:48.838 --> 17:50.840
(pills rattle)

18:04.554 --> 18:08.118
SO... THIS IS NICE--

18:08.118 --> 18:10.290
LITTLE FAMILY GET-TOGETHER.

18:11.661 --> 18:14.164
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL LUCY?

18:14.164 --> 18:16.366
OH, YOU KNOW HER,
ALWAYS BUSY.

18:18.128 --> 18:21.401
SO, MOM... YOU LOOK GOOD.

18:21.401 --> 18:23.473
THANKS. YOU SEEING ANYBODY?

18:25.275 --> 18:27.177
NOT THAT I WANNA
TELLYOUABOUT.

18:27.177 --> 18:29.279
(clenches teeth)
MM, STILL ALONE.

18:29.279 --> 18:32.382
OOH, LOOK.
THE SPECIAL IS CHICKEN.

18:32.382 --> 18:34.714
DOESN'T THAT SOUND GOOD?
 OOH, ORDER ME ONE.

18:34.714 --> 18:39.619
I-I'M GOING TO THE BAR AND--
AND CHECK THE SCORE ON THE GAME.
 HAVE FUN.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.522
I KNOW WHAT THIS IS,
AND I'M NOT DOING IT.

18:42.522 --> 18:45.595
WHAT? WHAT?
WE'RE HAVING LUNCH.
 SHE'S NOT MOVING BACK IN.

18:45.595 --> 18:48.298
I RESIST YOUR ATTEMPTS
TO MANIPULATE ME.

18:48.298 --> 18:50.300
NOBODY IS MANIPULATING YOU.

18:50.300 --> 18:51.631
MY BOUNDARIES ARE STRONG.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.634
I KNOW WHAT I WANT,
AND I DESERVE TO BE HAPPY.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.806
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE?
ARE YOU READING FROM SOMETHING?

18:56.806 --> 18:58.168
OKAY!

18:58.168 --> 19:00.270
AS SOON AS YOU
INVITED ME TOLUNCH,

19:00.270 --> 19:02.212
I CALLED MY THERAPIST.

19:02.212 --> 19:03.513
AND HE TOLD ME

19:03.513 --> 19:06.316
YOU'D TRY TO GUILT ME
INTO TAKING MOM BACK, BUT...

19:06.316 --> 19:08.618
"I WILL NOT
BE EMOTIONALLY BLACKMAILED."

19:08.618 --> 19:10.380
GIVE ME THAT.

19:10.380 --> 19:12.622
I ALREADY HAD HER, LYNETTE.

19:12.622 --> 19:14.624
SHE STAYED WITH ME
FOR TWO YEARS--

19:14.624 --> 19:17.357
TWO YEARSIN WHICH
MY WEIGHT BALLOONED.

19:17.357 --> 19:19.789
SHE PUT ME THROUGH
FOUR DIFFERENT HAIRSTYLES.

19:19.789 --> 19:23.233
ONCE, SHE EVEN BROUGHT HOME
THIS GUY SHE MET AT A BAR.

19:23.233 --> 19:26.696
(chuckles)
SHE'SSONOT LIKE THAT NOW.

19:26.696 --> 19:28.238
I DON'T CARE.

19:28.238 --> 19:31.241
THE DAY SHE MOVED OUT,
I GOT MY LIFE BACK.

19:31.241 --> 19:33.743
SO IF YOU WANNA HAVE LUNCH,
FINE.

19:33.743 --> 19:35.375
BUT THAT'S IT.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.547
OKAY. OKAY.

19:37.547 --> 19:40.210
OKAY.

19:40.210 --> 19:41.180
(sighs)

19:47.857 --> 19:50.490
GOOD FOR YOU.

19:53.223 --> 19:54.524
I'M SORRY.

20:01.731 --> 20:03.833
WHERE'S THE CHICKEN?

20:03.833 --> 20:07.307
OH, YEAH. WHERE IS THAT WAITER?
I'M GONNA GO FIND HIM.

20:09.509 --> 20:11.341
JUST HEAR ME OUT.

20:13.783 --> 20:15.845
IF YOU TRIM THE SIDES IN
A LITTLE,

20:15.845 --> 20:19.549
I THINK YOU'LL LOSE THAT
WINGY EFFECT YOU HAVE GOING NOW.

20:19.549 --> 20:20.850
MOM!

20:20.850 --> 20:23.693
WELL, I'M JUST SAYING THAT
WITH THE SHAPE OF YOUR FACE,

20:23.693 --> 20:26.456
YOU'RE NOT DOING YOURSELF
ANY FAVORS.
 DO YOU THINK

20:26.456 --> 20:28.628
YOU COULD GO FOR ONE MINUTE
WITHOUT BEING CRITICAL?

20:28.628 --> 20:30.430
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

20:30.430 --> 20:34.264
I HAVE NOT SAID ONE WORD
ABOUT YOUR EYE SHADOW YET.

20:36.566 --> 20:38.237
"I REJECT YOUR NEGATIVITY.

20:38.237 --> 20:41.271
I AM AS BEAUTIFUL
AS I FEEL INSIDE."

20:41.271 --> 20:43.373
(tires screech)
 (groans)

20:44.744 --> 20:46.476
OH, IT'S YOU.

20:46.476 --> 20:48.478
THANK YOU FOR CALLING
ABOUT MY PAINTING.

20:48.478 --> 20:51.421
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I FORGOT THAT.

20:51.421 --> 20:53.723
YEAH, I KNOW
IT MEANT A LOT TO YOU.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.728
THERE'S A HOLE IN IT.

20:58.728 --> 21:01.331
YEAH, I DON'T GET
MODERN ART EITHER.

21:01.331 --> 21:02.992
OKAY, EDIE...

21:02.992 --> 21:05.465
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE ANGRY
RIGHT NOW, BUT--

21:05.465 --> 21:07.337
YOU THINKI'MANGRY?

21:07.337 --> 21:09.669
(chuckles)
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN VICTOR.

21:09.669 --> 21:11.701
WHAT?

21:11.701 --> 21:14.374
YEAH, WE HAD A LITTLE CHAT.

21:14.374 --> 21:17.347
ACTUALLY, HE DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT
YOU WERE SCREWING HIS WIFE...

21:17.347 --> 21:19.349
UNTIL I SHOWED HIM
SOME PHOTOS,

21:19.349 --> 21:22.652
AND THEN HE WAS JUST ENRAGED.

21:22.652 --> 21:25.485
IT WAS A LITTLE SCARY.

21:26.986 --> 21:30.890
(cell phone rings)

21:30.890 --> 21:32.522
(scoffs)

21:32.522 --> 21:34.394
FOR GOD SAKES, CARLOS,

21:34.394 --> 21:36.696
AM I GONNA HAVE
TO CHANGE THIS NUMBER?

21:36.696 --> 21:38.428
VICTOR KNOWS.

21:38.428 --> 21:40.330
KNOWS WHAT?
 Everything.

21:40.330 --> 21:42.872
EDIE TOLD HIM
WE'RE HAVING AN AFFAIR.

21:42.872 --> 21:44.874
NO, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
HE HASN'T SAID A WORD.

21:44.874 --> 21:49.008
IN FACT, I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
SO SWEET AND ATTENTIVE.

21:49.008 --> 21:50.710
IT'S AN ACT!

21:50.710 --> 21:52.712
EDIE SAID HE WAS ENRAGED.

21:52.712 --> 21:55.415
WELL, IF HE'S SO MAD AT ME,

21:55.415 --> 21:59.349
WHY WOULD HE TAKE ME
ON A BOAT TRIP?
 HE TOOK YOU ON A BOAT?

22:00.750 --> 22:03.793
OH, CRAP.
 I THINK YOU NEED
TO GET OUT OF THERE.

22:03.793 --> 22:04.954
GABY?

22:04.954 --> 22:06.656
OH!

22:06.656 --> 22:09.399
OH, UH...

22:09.399 --> 22:11.531
I-I WAS JUST
TALKING TO... BREE.

22:11.531 --> 22:13.503
OH. OH, NO, NO.

22:13.503 --> 22:16.466
WE AGREED--TOTAL PRIVACY.

22:18.508 --> 22:20.810
WHEN WE HEAD HOME,
YOU CAN HAVE IT BACK.

22:20.810 --> 22:24.644
AND YOU CAN TALK TO... BREE
AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE.

22:38.388 --> 22:40.660
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING?

22:40.660 --> 22:43.533
NO, I'M GOOD.

22:46.065 --> 22:47.397
YOU OKAY?

22:47.397 --> 22:50.740
UH, ACTUALLY,
I'M REALLY COLD.

22:50.740 --> 22:53.443
MAYBE WE SHOULD BAIL
AND DO THIS ANOTHER DAY.

22:53.443 --> 22:56.576
YOU KNOW, WHEN IT'S WARMER.
 IT'LL WARM UP.

22:56.576 --> 23:00.510
OH, OKAY, WELL, JUST IN CASE,
WE SHOULD RUN BACK TO SHORE

23:00.510 --> 23:02.381
SO I CAN GRAB A JACKET.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.714
GABY...

23:04.714 --> 23:06.756
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

23:06.756 --> 23:08.458
I'M NOT?

23:08.458 --> 23:11.761
I KNOW ABOUT EVERYTHING--YOU,
CARLOS, THE AFFAIR, EVERYTHING.

23:13.823 --> 23:17.527
OKAY. I AM SO SORRY.

23:17.527 --> 23:19.529
BUT IN MY DEFENSE,

23:19.529 --> 23:21.000
YOU WERE ALWAYS GONE,

23:21.000 --> 23:24.834
AND YOU KNEW HOW NEEDY I WAS
WHEN YOU MARRIED ME.

23:24.834 --> 23:28.137
THAT'S IT? THAT'S ALL
YOU HAVE TO SAY TO ME?

23:28.137 --> 23:32.111
WELL, IT'D BE EASIER TO TALK
IF WE WERE BACK ON SHORE.

23:39.018 --> 23:41.420
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:41.420 --> 23:44.093
IT'S BAD ENOUGH
YOU'VE BETRAYED ME.

23:44.093 --> 23:47.627
NOW I HAVE TO LISTEN
TO YOUR WHINING?

23:47.627 --> 23:49.028
(mouths word)

23:49.028 --> 23:50.930
I BROUGHT SOMETHING FOR YOU.

23:52.502 --> 23:54.433
(both grunt)

24:00.470 --> 24:01.541
GABY!

24:01.541 --> 24:04.614
(motor revs)

24:04.614 --> 24:06.476
GABY!

24:06.476 --> 24:08.648
GABY!

24:22.091 --> 24:23.893
WHAT'S THAT?

24:23.893 --> 24:27.466
EVERYTHING I KNOW
ABOUT YOUR FATHER--

24:27.466 --> 24:30.099
DATE OF BIRTH,
HIS MOTHER'S NAME,

24:30.099 --> 24:32.471
LAST KNOWN ADDRESS.

24:32.471 --> 24:35.474
IT'S EVERYTHING YOU NEED
TO FIND HIM.

24:35.474 --> 24:38.047
WOW.

24:38.047 --> 24:39.549
THANK YOU.

24:42.912 --> 24:46.516
BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS...

24:46.516 --> 24:48.718
YOU HAVE
TO PROMISE ME SOMETHING.

24:52.662 --> 24:54.664
OKAY.

24:54.664 --> 24:57.767
YOU CANNOT BRING HIM HERE...

24:57.767 --> 25:00.269
OR EVEN TELL HIM WHERE I AM.

25:00.269 --> 25:02.231
WHY?

25:02.231 --> 25:04.874
THE LAST TIME
THAT I SAW YOUR FATHER,

25:04.874 --> 25:07.877
IT WAS TO TELL HIM
THAT I WAS LEAVING HIM,

25:07.877 --> 25:10.640
AND I WAS
TAKING YOU WITH ME.

25:13.242 --> 25:18.548
HE, UH, HE ALWAYS LIKED
TO SLAP ME AROUND A LITTLE BIT.

25:18.548 --> 25:22.151
BUT THAT NIGHT WAS...

25:22.151 --> 25:24.654
(sighs)

25:24.654 --> 25:26.125
UNIMAGINABLE.

25:26.125 --> 25:27.797
I DON'T REMEMBER EVERYTHING.

25:27.797 --> 25:31.300
I-I WAS IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE
BY THE END OF IT.

25:31.300 --> 25:33.903
BUT ONCE HE WAS DONE

25:33.903 --> 25:37.567
SLAMMING MY FACE
INTO THE WALL,

25:37.567 --> 25:39.969
HE STARTED CHOKING ME,

25:39.969 --> 25:42.241
AND HE KEPT SCREAMING

25:42.241 --> 25:45.715
THAT HE WAS GONNA KILL ME.

25:45.715 --> 25:47.717
(voice breaks)
AND THE LAST THOUGHT

25:47.717 --> 25:50.780
THAT I HAD...

25:50.780 --> 25:53.122
(crying)

25:53.122 --> 25:56.325
WAS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO YOU
IF I DIED.

26:00.760 --> 26:03.332
SO YOU CAN'T TELL HIM
WHERE I AM.

26:05.334 --> 26:07.296
YOU JUST CAN'T.

26:15.745 --> 26:18.047
MAYBE YOU CAN
TALK TO MY TEACHER TOMORROW...

26:18.047 --> 26:21.280
(sniffles) AND HAVE HER
GIVE ME ANOTHER ASSIGNMENT.

26:23.683 --> 26:25.154
(whispers) THANK YOU.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.594
(sighs deeply)

26:48.738 --> 26:52.011
I TOLD YOU, IF YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE A TREE HOUSE...
 (car approaches)

26:52.011 --> 26:53.783
YOU'VE GOTTA KEEP IT CLEAN.

26:53.783 --> 26:55.614
(tires screech)

26:59.218 --> 27:02.621
HERE. TAKE THESE AND DUMP THEM
BY THE FRONT DOOR.

27:02.621 --> 27:05.354
HEY, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?!

27:08.097 --> 27:11.731
MOM, HURRY.
GET OUT OF THE CAR.

27:11.731 --> 27:13.032
(Lynette) HEY!

27:13.032 --> 27:14.664
HEY, HEY! HEY!

27:14.664 --> 27:17.737
NO, NO, NO.
YOU ARE NOT LEAVING THOSE HERE.

27:17.737 --> 27:18.808
HI, MOM.

27:18.808 --> 27:21.010
TAKE HER AWAY.
 UNH-UNH, LYNETTE.

27:21.010 --> 27:23.112
YOU MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO STRONG-ARM THE WEAK ONE,

27:23.112 --> 27:25.114
BUT NOT ME.
 I'M NOT WEAK!

27:25.114 --> 27:28.117
THEN WHY DID YOU CALL ME?
GET OUT OF OUR WAY.
 LUCY, EVERY FIGHT
WE HAVE EVER HAD

27:28.117 --> 27:30.119
HAS ENDED WITH
MY FOOT ON YOUR NECK.

27:30.119 --> 27:33.723
I GUARANTEE THAT THIS ONE'S
GONNA END THE SAME WAY, TOO.

27:33.723 --> 27:40.860
MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK INSIDE.

27:40.860 --> 27:43.332
(door opens)

27:43.332 --> 27:44.994
(door closes)

27:58.978 --> 28:02.381
I'M OFTEN ASKED
WHY THE TORAH TELLS US

28:02.381 --> 28:06.215
THAT A CHILD MUST BE CIRCUMCISED
ON THE EIGHTH DAY OF HIS LIFE.

28:06.215 --> 28:09.789
SOME SAY THAT'S HOW LONG IT
TAKES TO GET A DECENT CATERER.

28:09.789 --> 28:12.421
(laughter)

28:12.421 --> 28:15.424
(baby crying)

28:18.367 --> 28:20.699
WHAT A LOVELY CEREMONY.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.802
I'M DEBORAH'S FRIEND BREE.

28:22.802 --> 28:26.405
I HAVE WHAT MAY STRIKE YOU
AS A VERY ODD REQUEST.

28:26.405 --> 28:28.707
TRUST ME, IT WON'T BE ONE
I HAVEN'T HEARD.

28:28.707 --> 28:29.839
HMM.
 (chuckles)

28:29.839 --> 28:31.841
DO YOU THINK,
WHILE YOU'RE HERE,

28:31.841 --> 28:34.713
DO COULD DO A BRIS
FOR MY BABY, TOO?

28:34.713 --> 28:36.285
OKAY, NEW ONE.

28:36.285 --> 28:37.947
GOOD FOR YOU.

28:37.947 --> 28:41.851
I KNOW IT MIGHT SEEM TACKY
PIGGYBACKING ON DEBORAH'S BRIS,

28:41.851 --> 28:45.424
BUT... WE COULD DO IT
IN THE DEN VERY QUIETLY.

28:45.424 --> 28:47.726
UH, WELL, AS WE JUST SAW,

28:47.726 --> 28:50.459
THERE'S SO SUCH THING
AS A QUIET BRIS.

28:50.459 --> 28:52.461
YOU SAID YOUR NAME WAS BREE?

28:52.461 --> 28:55.504
YES, BREE HODGE...

28:55.504 --> 28:57.166
BORN RABINOWITZ.

28:57.166 --> 28:59.939
HUH. I WOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN YOU
FOR JEWISH.

28:59.939 --> 29:03.412
I SHOULD ONLY HAVE A NICKEL
FOR EVERY TIME I'VE HEARD THAT.

29:03.412 --> 29:05.414
DON'T YOU WANT A PROPER BRIS

29:05.414 --> 29:08.417
WITH YOUR FRIENDS
AND FAMILY THERE?
 I WOULD LOVE THAT,

29:08.417 --> 29:11.951
BUT MY HUSBAND ORSON--
BIG, STUBBORN, GOY.

29:11.951 --> 29:14.183
HE SAYS
WE SHOULD DO NOTHING

29:14.183 --> 29:17.286
AND LET THE CHILD DECIDE
WHEN HE'S GROWN.

29:17.286 --> 29:20.759
WE DON'T PICK OUR PARENTS--
WE SHOULD PICK OUR RELIGION?

29:20.759 --> 29:22.761
I WOULDN'T FEEL RIGHT
DOING THIS

29:22.761 --> 29:25.064
WITHOUT SPEAKING
TO YOUR HUSBAND.

29:25.064 --> 29:27.296
WELL, HE'S OUT OF TOWN,
AND...

29:27.296 --> 29:30.469
OUR BENJAMIN
IS 8 DAYS OLD TODAY.

29:30.469 --> 29:32.541
AND IF I DON'T DO THIS,

29:32.541 --> 29:35.845
MY GRANDMA...

29:35.845 --> 29:37.176
TZEITEL...

29:37.176 --> 29:39.879
WILL NEVER FORGIVE ME,
MAY SHE REST IN PEACE.

29:39.879 --> 29:43.552
YOU REALIZE
THAT THIS IS A COVENANT?

29:43.552 --> 29:45.554
THAT WHATEVER
YOUR HUSBAND SAYS,

29:45.554 --> 29:47.216
YOU ARE PROMISING

29:47.216 --> 29:49.919
TO RAISE YOUR CHILD
AS A DEVOUT JEW?

29:52.261 --> 29:54.263
I SWEAR TO YOU BEFORE GOD

29:54.263 --> 29:59.068
THAT THIS CHILD WILL BE
AS DEVOUT A JEW AS I AM.

30:11.140 --> 30:15.144
HEY, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
I WOKE UP, AND YOU WERE GONE.

30:15.144 --> 30:17.146
OH, WE HAD A VERY BUSY DAY.

30:17.146 --> 30:19.148
WE DROPPED OFF
THE DRY CLEANING,

30:19.148 --> 30:21.450
WE DEPOSITED MONEY
INTO OUR CHRISTMAS ACCOUNT,

30:21.450 --> 30:25.224
AND THEN WE GOT CIRCUMCISED.

30:25.224 --> 30:27.056
YOU DID WHAT?!

30:28.457 --> 30:31.460
IT'S JUST A LITTLE UNSIGHTLY
FORESKIN. HE'LL NEVER MISS IT.

30:31.460 --> 30:34.463
SO WHY STOP THERE? WHY--WHY NOT
CUT OFF HIS TESTICLES?

30:34.463 --> 30:37.336
YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE NO PROBLEM
GOING AFTER MINE.
 ORSON.

30:37.336 --> 30:39.338
WELL,
WHAT DO YOU CALL IT, BREE?

30:39.338 --> 30:42.011
GOING BEHIND MY BACK,
IGNORING MY FEELINGS ON THIS?

30:42.011 --> 30:44.013
I GAVE THEM
VERY SERIOUS CONSIDERATION.

30:44.013 --> 30:46.015
BUT IT'S MY BLOOD
RUNNING IN HIS VEINS,

30:46.015 --> 30:48.617
WHICH ULTIMATELY
MAKES IT MY DECISION.

30:48.617 --> 30:51.180
YOURBLOOD?

30:51.180 --> 30:52.521
(scoffs)

30:52.521 --> 30:55.584
SO WHO AM I TO BENJAMIN?

30:55.584 --> 30:57.626
A FRIENDLY UNCLE?
A MALE NANNY?

30:57.626 --> 30:59.428
OF COURSE NOT.

30:59.428 --> 31:01.430
THEN WHY DO YOU TREAT ME

31:01.430 --> 31:03.492
LIKE I'M ANYTHING LESS
THAN HIS FATHER?

31:03.492 --> 31:05.494
I MEAN,
HAVEN'T I EARNED THAT

31:05.494 --> 31:07.536
DURING THE COURSE
OF OUR LITTLE HOAX?

31:07.536 --> 31:10.069
I LIED FOR YOU.
I-I RISKED PUBLIC HUMILIATION.

31:10.069 --> 31:12.902
I DO EVERYTHING BUT STRAP ON
THE PREGNANCY HARNESS MYSELF.

31:12.902 --> 31:14.573
I KNOW THAT.

31:14.573 --> 31:19.108
I SEE MYSELF
AS BENJAMIN'S FATHER.

31:20.910 --> 31:24.453
I NEED TO KNOW
IF YOU SEE ME THAT WAY, TOO.

31:27.456 --> 31:30.419
I KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU LOVE BENJAMIN.

31:32.922 --> 31:35.224
I GUESS...

31:35.224 --> 31:37.526
I GUESS
I JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER

31:37.526 --> 31:40.529
THAT IT'S LOVE THAT MAKES US
A FAMILY AND NOT BLOOD.

31:43.132 --> 31:46.135
(Benjamin cooing)

31:56.485 --> 32:00.919
YOUR SON WOULD LIKE YOU
TO HOLD HIM.

32:09.058 --> 32:12.531
BY THE WAY,
HIS HEBREW NAME IS SIMCHA.

32:14.133 --> 32:16.305
I'LL EXPLAIN LATER.

32:23.973 --> 32:26.545
OH, CARLOS,
THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE.

32:26.545 --> 32:27.516
OH.

32:27.516 --> 32:29.718
WHERE IS HE?
WHERE'S VICTOR?

32:29.718 --> 32:32.481
WELL, I-I CLUBBED HIM
AND KNOCKED HIM OVERBOARD.

32:32.481 --> 32:34.253
HE'S IN THE OCEAN?!

32:34.253 --> 32:36.555
HE WAS GOING TO KILL ME!
HE HAD A GUN.

32:36.555 --> 32:39.628
OKAY, OKAY, LET ME THINK.

32:39.628 --> 32:42.631
YOU SAW HIM IN THE WATER.
I MEAN, HE'S NOT DEAD, RIGHT?

32:42.631 --> 32:46.135
NO, HE'S MAD,
BUT HE WASN'T DEAD.
 SO THEN WE'LL SEND SOMEONE
OUT THERE TO FISH HIM OUT.

32:46.135 --> 32:48.137
WE'LL CALL THE POLICE,
SHOW 'EM THE GUN

32:48.137 --> 32:50.139
AND TELL THAT 'EM
THAT IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE.

32:50.139 --> 32:51.570
YOU STILL HAVE THE GUN?

32:58.477 --> 33:00.649
IT'S IN THERE.

33:04.513 --> 33:08.587
WELL, MAYBE HE WANTED IT
TO MUFFLE THE GUN.

33:08.587 --> 33:12.521
(sighs deeply)
THERE IS NO GUN.

33:12.521 --> 33:16.495
ICE PICK?

33:16.495 --> 33:19.328
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
 I'M CALLING THE COAST GUARD.

33:19.328 --> 33:21.630
AND TELL THEM WHAT,
I KNOCKED MY HUSBAND OVERBOARD

33:21.630 --> 33:24.533
BECAUSE HE WAS COMING AFTER ME
WITH A SWEATER?

33:24.533 --> 33:28.177
NO, COME ON.
WE GOTTA GO BACK OUT THERE.

33:28.177 --> 33:30.209
(Lynette) GUYS,
I CAN'T BE ANY CLEARER ON THIS.

33:30.209 --> 33:33.642
I AM NOT TAKING HER BACK.
 (Lucy) IT'S YOUR TURN,
SIMPLE AS THAT.

33:33.642 --> 33:35.644
I'VE HAD HER
FOR FOUR MONTHS.

33:35.644 --> 33:38.247
I ALSO HAD CANCER
FOR FOUR MONTHS,

33:38.247 --> 33:41.190
AND IF I COULD'VE
ASKED ONE OF THEM TO LEAVE,

33:41.190 --> 33:44.193
I'M NOT SURE WHICH
I WOULD'VE PICKED.
 OH, FOUR MONTHS, BOOHOO.
I HAD HER FOR A YEAR,

33:44.193 --> 33:47.226
AND THAT WAS THE YEAR SHE JOINED
THE GIN OF THE MONTH CLUB.

33:47.226 --> 33:49.698
I DON'T HAVE ANY ROOM
FOR HER.

33:49.698 --> 33:52.201
I ALREADY HAVE SEVEN PEOPLE
IN FOUR BEDROOMS.

33:52.201 --> 33:55.204
THERE IT IS--
THE "I HAVE A FAMILY" CARD.
 CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU CAN REPRODUCE.

33:55.204 --> 33:57.536
WE'RE ALL THRILLED FOR YOU.

33:57.536 --> 33:59.408
WHY CAN'TYOUTAKE HER?

33:59.408 --> 34:01.710
YOU ARE IN THAT HUGE HOUSE
ALL BY YOURSELF

34:01.710 --> 34:04.743
THAT YOU GOT
FROM THE DIVORCE.
 DAVE AND I ARE JUST SEPARATED.

34:04.743 --> 34:06.745
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
THAT HE'S MOVING BACK IN,

34:06.745 --> 34:11.449
BUT NOT IF MOM IS LIVING THERE.
 WELL, WE CAN'T JUST
THROW HER OUT ON THE STREET.

34:11.449 --> 34:14.283
I CAN.

34:14.283 --> 34:15.754
MY THERAPIST SAID

34:15.754 --> 34:18.786
IT'S TIME FOR ME TO BE
A LITTLE MORE "LYDIA-CENTRIC."

34:18.786 --> 34:22.331
IREALLYWANNA MEET
THIS JACKASS.

34:22.331 --> 34:25.464
OKAY,
WE ALL HAVE OUR EXCUSES,

34:25.464 --> 34:27.735
BUT WE GOTTA
FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

34:27.735 --> 34:29.737
COME ON.
SHE IS OUR MOTHER.

34:29.737 --> 34:32.070
IS SHE?

34:32.070 --> 34:35.072
SHE NEVER ACTED LIKE ONE,
NOT THAT I CAN REMEMBER.

34:35.072 --> 34:37.146
I REMEMBER SHE SHOWED UP DRUNK
TO MY GRADUATION,

34:37.146 --> 34:38.706
WEARING A HOUSECOAT.

34:38.706 --> 34:41.210
OKAY, BUT THE POINT IS,
SHE WENT.

34:41.210 --> 34:42.681
REMEMBER THAT ONE CHRISTMAS?

34:42.681 --> 34:46.514
AND WE CAME DOWN, AND THERE WAS
MOM UNDER THE TREE,

34:46.514 --> 34:49.388
PASSED OUT DRUNK IN THE MIDDLE
OF ALL OF OUR UNWRAPPED TOYS.

34:49.388 --> 34:51.590
MY RAGGEDY ANN SMELLED
LIKE PEPPERMINT SCHNAPPS.

34:51.590 --> 34:54.322
OKAY, SHE WASN'T PERFECT,
 CLEARLY.

34:54.322 --> 34:56.324
BUT SHE GAVE BIRTH TO US.

34:56.324 --> 34:59.228
WE OWE HER OUR LIVES,
AND NOW THAT SHE NEEDS US,

34:59.228 --> 35:01.770
WE CAN'T JUST
TURN OUR BACK ON HER.

35:01.770 --> 35:04.733
I KNOW I'M SUPPOSED
TO FEEL GUILTY, BUT I DON'T.

35:04.733 --> 35:07.406
I DON'T EITHER.

35:07.406 --> 35:11.840
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE SAYING
YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT HER.

35:13.882 --> 35:15.844
AT ALL?

35:18.347 --> 35:21.690
AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.

35:21.690 --> 35:24.393
WELL... IFYOUCARE SO MUCH,

35:24.393 --> 35:28.757
THEN THE ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM
IS SORTA OBVIOUS, ISN'T IT?

35:30.599 --> 35:33.802
WE CAN HELP WITH MONEY.

35:33.802 --> 35:36.305
I CAN SEND YOU
$100 A MONTH.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.741
(whispers) WOW.

35:42.741 --> 35:44.743
(normal voice)
I DON'T NEED YOUR MONEY.

35:44.743 --> 35:47.776
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MY MOTHER
ALL BY MYSELF.

35:47.776 --> 35:49.348
LYNETTE...

35:49.348 --> 35:50.819
HERE'S HOW YOUCANHELP--

35:50.819 --> 35:53.682
DON'TVISIT
FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS,

35:53.682 --> 35:55.354
'CAUSE IT SEEMS FAIRLY LIKELY

35:55.354 --> 35:58.156
I WON'T HAVE
STOPPED HATING YOU BY THEN.

36:01.430 --> 36:05.364
I GUESS THAT'S HER WAY
OF ASKING US TO LEAVE.

36:05.364 --> 36:07.366
MOM,
WHERE'S GRANDMA GOING?

36:07.366 --> 36:09.238
GOING?

36:25.214 --> 36:26.785
WAIT.

36:26.785 --> 36:28.317
WHAT'S THAT?

36:28.317 --> 36:30.959
GABY!

36:30.959 --> 36:34.263
(panting)

36:34.263 --> 36:35.924
HERE. SIT HIM HERE.

36:35.924 --> 36:38.967
OH, MY GOD.

36:38.967 --> 36:41.970
(panting)

36:41.970 --> 36:44.333
YOU TRIED TO KILL ME.

36:44.333 --> 36:46.935
WELL, I CAME BACK FOR YOU,
DIDN'T I?

36:46.935 --> 36:49.808
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!
 WELL, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE TRYING TO KILLME.

36:49.808 --> 36:52.311
I WAS JUST
TRYING TO TALK TO YOU,

36:52.311 --> 36:54.313
SEE IF WE STILL HAD A CHANCE.

36:54.313 --> 36:57.416
I SEE THAT YOU'RE
STILL SCREWING THIS GUY.

36:57.416 --> 37:00.289
AND WHAT THE HELL
IS HE DOING ON MY BOAT?!

37:00.289 --> 37:02.351
YOU MEAN,
BESIDES SAVING YOUR LIFE?

37:02.351 --> 37:05.354
THAT WAS A BIG MISTAKE, BUDDY.

37:05.354 --> 37:06.925
(laughs) OH, RIGHT.

37:06.925 --> 37:08.927
YEAH,
YOU'RE THE GUY THAT SAID

37:08.927 --> 37:10.929
IF ANYONE
MESSED WITH YOUR WOMAN,

37:10.929 --> 37:13.332
THAT YOU'D USE YOUR MONEY
TO MAKE 'EM DISAPPEAR.

37:13.332 --> 37:16.004
BUT RIGHT NOW
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME.

37:16.004 --> 37:18.807
SO HOW TOUGH ARE YOU
WITHOUT YOUR A.T.M. CARD?

37:22.411 --> 37:24.813
THAT'S WHAT I FIGURED.

37:26.515 --> 37:27.876
(groans)
 AAH! VICTOR!

37:27.876 --> 37:29.878
OH, MY GOD!

37:29.878 --> 37:31.249
(grunts)

37:31.249 --> 37:33.352
VICTOR! OH! OH, MY GOD!

37:33.352 --> 37:35.754
COME ON. GET UP!
 HEY. HEY.

37:35.754 --> 37:38.287
GET UP. I WANNA SEE
THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE

37:38.287 --> 37:40.589
WHEN THE KNIFE GOES IN.

37:40.589 --> 37:42.661
AH!
 (grunts)

37:46.034 --> 37:48.867
OH, I'M GETTING PRETTY GOOD
AT THAT.

37:48.867 --> 37:51.570
(groans) OKAY,
LET'S PULL HIM BACK IN AGAIN.

37:51.570 --> 37:54.573
WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY?!
 OH, WE'LL JUST TIE HIM UP
SO HE DOESN'T CAUSE ANY TROUBLE.

37:54.573 --> 37:55.804
VICTOR!

37:58.607 --> 38:01.580
WHERE'D HE GO?
 VICTOR!

38:01.580 --> 38:04.052
VICTOR! VICTOR!

38:25.634 --> 38:28.637
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO BACK OUT
AND LOOK SOME MORE.

38:28.637 --> 38:30.939
WE LOOKED FOR SIX HOURS.
HE'S GONE.

38:30.939 --> 38:34.643
(sighs deeply)
OH, MY GOD. WE KILLED HIM.

38:34.643 --> 38:36.515
IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE, RIGHT?

38:36.515 --> 38:40.889
I MEAN,
HE WAS TRYING TO KILL US.
 WE CAN'T PROVE THAT.

38:40.889 --> 38:42.421
(sighs)

38:42.421 --> 38:45.053
THIS IS BAD, GABY.

38:45.053 --> 38:48.056
OH, WHEN PEOPLE FIND OUT WE WERE
ON THAT BOAT WITH HIM, IT...

38:49.658 --> 38:51.800
MAYBE THEY WON'T.

38:51.800 --> 38:53.732
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

38:53.732 --> 38:56.935
NO ONE BUT YOU
KNOWS I WAS WITH VICTOR.

38:56.935 --> 38:59.808
I'LL SAY HE WENT OUT ALONE.

38:59.808 --> 39:01.810
I TOLD HIM
I WAS LEAVING HIM,

39:01.810 --> 39:03.872
AND HE WAS DEPRESSED,
SUICIDAL EVEN.

39:03.872 --> 39:06.044
ONLY ONE PROBLEM--

39:06.044 --> 39:08.116
THE BOAT'S RIGHT HERE.

39:08.116 --> 39:12.381
THEN MAYBE THE BOAT
NEEDS TO GO BACK OUT...

39:12.381 --> 39:13.682
ALONE.

39:31.500 --> 39:34.072
(sighs)

39:34.072 --> 39:36.975
WHATEVER YOU'RE THINKING,
I CAN EXPLAIN.

39:36.975 --> 39:39.978
I'M THINKING THAT YOU'RE
A DRUG ADDICT AND A LIAR,

39:39.978 --> 39:42.851
SO SAY SOMETHING
THAT'S NOT THAT.
 SUSAN, LISTEN--

39:42.851 --> 39:44.853
IS ITSOHORRIBLE
LIVING WITH ME?

39:44.853 --> 39:47.656
I MEAN,
DO I MAKE YOUSOMISERABLE

39:47.656 --> 39:50.659
THAT YOU CAN'T EVEN FACE ME
WITHOUT NUMBING THE PAIN?

39:50.659 --> 39:52.020
OF COURSE NOT.

39:52.020 --> 39:53.692
I LOVE YOU.

39:53.692 --> 39:56.124
WELL, IF YOU DID,
YOU WOULDN'T BE DOING THIS!

39:56.124 --> 40:00.629
I MEAN, MY GOD, MIKE,
WE HAVE A BABY ON THE WAY!

40:01.600 --> 40:03.602
CAN I SAY SOMETHING NOW?

40:03.602 --> 40:07.035
SURE, GO AHEAD. OH, SHOULD I
LOOK YOU IN THE EYES?

40:07.035 --> 40:09.738
DOES IT MAKE IT EASIER
FOR YOU TO LIE?

40:09.738 --> 40:11.980
I DIDN'T TELL YOU...
 (pills rattle)

40:11.980 --> 40:14.983
ABOUT THE PILLS 'CAUSE I DIDN'T
WANT YOU TO FEEL GUILTY.

40:14.983 --> 40:17.115
ME FEEL GUILTY?

40:17.115 --> 40:18.547
YEAH.

40:18.547 --> 40:20.619
WHEN I PUT IN THAT WATER HEATER
FOR McCLUSKEY,

40:20.619 --> 40:22.491
I REALLY WRENCHED MY SHOULDER,

40:22.491 --> 40:25.494
AND THE DOCTOR TOLD ME I SHOULD
TAKE A BREAK, BUT I DIDN'T

40:25.494 --> 40:28.497
BECAUSE THAT WAS THE DAY
WE FOUND OUT YOU WERE PREGNANT.

40:28.497 --> 40:30.559
AND FROM THEN ON,
ALL I HAVE HEARD ABOUT

40:30.559 --> 40:33.902
ARE CAR SEATS AND STROLLERS
AND $10,000 PRESCHOOLS.

40:33.902 --> 40:36.034
YOU KNOW,
IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE

40:36.034 --> 40:38.737
A REALLY GOOD TIME
FOR ME TO QUIT WORKING.

40:38.737 --> 40:41.640
(voice breaks) MIKE,
WE DON'T NEED ANY OF THAT STUFF.

40:41.640 --> 40:44.573
YEAH.

40:44.573 --> 40:47.015
YOU SAY THAT NOW.

40:47.015 --> 40:49.718
BUT WHEN BENJAMIN HODGE
IS IN HARVARD,

40:49.718 --> 40:53.922
AND OUR KID'S
JUST A PLUMBER LIKE HIS DAD...

40:56.855 --> 40:59.958
I JUST WANT
TO BE ABLE TO GIVE HIM

40:59.958 --> 41:02.460
THE ADVANTAGES I NEVER GOT.

41:04.162 --> 41:06.635
GOD, THE ONLY ADVANTAGE
HE NEEDS

41:06.635 --> 41:09.638
IS TO HAVE A HEALTHY DAD
WHO'S NOT DOING THIS.

41:12.470 --> 41:16.705
YOU'RE RIGHT.

41:16.705 --> 41:20.649
I GET IT. OKAY?

41:20.649 --> 41:21.780
I'M DONE.

41:21.780 --> 41:24.753
(sighs deeply)

41:24.753 --> 41:28.086
I WANNA BELIEVE YOU.
IT'S JUST...

41:28.086 --> 41:30.158
THAT ADDICTS
ARE GOOD AT LYING.

41:30.158 --> 41:33.261
(sighs) YEAH.

41:33.261 --> 41:35.694
ALL RIGHT...

41:35.694 --> 41:37.566
HOW ABOUT THIS?

41:52.180 --> 41:54.042
YOU BELIEVE ME NOW?

41:56.044 --> 41:57.746
THANK YOU.

41:57.746 --> 42:00.689
(crying)

42:00.689 --> 42:02.150
DECEPTION--

42:02.150 --> 42:05.754
YOU FIND IT
IN ALL THE BEST HOMES.

42:08.156 --> 42:12.861
PARENTS RELY ON IT WHEN DEALING
WITH INQUISITIVE CHILDREN...

42:16.534 --> 42:20.709
WOMEN USE IT TO HELP
KEEP SECRETS--BIG AND SMALL.

42:24.573 --> 42:26.575
LOVERS NEED IT

42:26.575 --> 42:30.048
TO COVER UP
INCONVENIENT ACCIDENTS.

42:32.951 --> 42:36.284
WHY DO PEOPLE
RESORT TO DECEPTION?

42:38.857 --> 42:42.260
BECAUSE IT'S A HANDY TOOL

42:42.260 --> 42:44.763
THAT HELPS GET US

42:44.763 --> 42:47.766
EXACTLY
 WHAT WE'RELOOKING FOR.
