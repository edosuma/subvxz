01:25.180 --> 01:27.390
- Hi!
- Ok, Francois?

01:27.391 --> 01:28.317
And you?

01:28.392 --> 01:31.276
Stephane... Francois...

01:31.354 --> 01:35.119
- Still on the team?
- As ready as ever.

01:41.198 --> 01:43.360
Hello.

01:46.787 --> 01:51.332
- This one?
- At the back, please.

02:01.178 --> 02:03.012
Hi, I'm Herve.

02:03.013 --> 02:06.058
A sports teacher here for 3 years.

02:06.392 --> 02:08.685
Welcome to all our new colleagues.

02:08.686 --> 02:11.480
The students can be tough...

02:11.481 --> 02:15.150
but they're good kids.

02:15.151 --> 02:17.736
Hi, I'm Olivier.

02:17.737 --> 02:20.114
I teach physical science...

02:20.115 --> 02:23.836
and I've been here for 4 years.

02:24.286 --> 02:26.120
I'm Patrick,

02:26.121 --> 02:29.791
and I teach multiplication tables,

02:29.792 --> 02:32.127
and sometimes mathematics!

02:32.128 --> 02:34.296
I've been at this school

02:34.297 --> 02:36.507
for a number of years.

02:36.508 --> 02:40.886
Hello, I'm Anne.
I used to work in the Lyon suburbs.

02:40.887 --> 02:42.763
I teach English.

02:42.764 --> 02:45.475
I'm looking for my new colleagues.

02:45.476 --> 02:47.329
Hi, I'm Isabelle

02:47.394 --> 02:48.603
Nice to meet you.

02:48.604 --> 02:50.148
I'm Christiane.

02:50.690 --> 02:55.319
I'm Frederic,
I teach history and geography.

02:55.320 --> 02:57.404
and I used to work
out in suburbs of Paris.

02:57.405 --> 03:01.274
I'm happy to be in the city now.

03:01.368 --> 03:04.871
I'm Julie, the year supervisor.
I'd like to welcome you all

03:04.872 --> 03:08.122
and wish you a good year.

03:08.125 --> 03:10.544
I'm Aline and I'm the cook

03:10.545 --> 03:13.338
I'd like to welcome you all.

03:13.339 --> 03:15.252
Thank you, Aline!

03:16.801 --> 03:21.055
Hello. I'm Gilles,
I've been teaching mathematics

03:21.056 --> 03:25.226
for many years

03:25.227 --> 03:30.106
I'm retiring at the end of this year

03:30.107 --> 03:34.182
I'd like to wish the new arrivals
plenty of courage.

03:37.073 --> 03:40.117
I'm Francois
I teach French.

03:40.118 --> 03:42.703
And I'm starting
my fourth year here

03:42.704 --> 03:45.072
Welcome everybody.

03:53.466 --> 03:55.926
We'll meet up at midday...

03:55.927 --> 03:59.339
in the canteen for a drink
to mark the new year.

04:11.569 --> 04:15.072
You get Wednesday like you wanted!

04:15.073 --> 04:17.911
We could swap our classes

04:19.828 --> 04:22.038
Nice, nice...

04:22.039 --> 04:24.248
Not nice, not nice at all.

04:24.249 --> 04:26.167
He's nice.

04:26.168 --> 04:29.462
Not nice, watch him.
Not nice at all.

04:29.463 --> 04:32.340
Nice, not nice.

04:32.341 --> 04:34.460
She's not nice at all.

04:42.895 --> 04:44.953
Arthur, your cap.

04:46.190 --> 04:48.719
Good morning.

04:50.695 --> 04:53.431
That's my place.

04:54.866 --> 05:00.866
Get lost!

05:24.022 --> 05:26.184
Calm down now!

05:29.570 --> 05:30.952
Stop stirring things up

05:30.988 --> 05:32.781
Remove your hood, please

05:32.782 --> 05:35.742
You two back there,
there's place here.

05:35.743 --> 05:38.203
- One up front.
- There's room here too!

05:38.204 --> 05:41.250
Let's get one thing clear...

05:46.505 --> 05:50.508
We waste 5 minutes
lining outside,

05:50.509 --> 05:52.427
5 coming up, 5 setting down:

05:52.428 --> 05:54.221
15 minutes out of hour

05:54.222 --> 05:57.266
Do you realize
what 15 lost minutes means?

05:57.267 --> 05:58.753
With 25 hours a week

05:58.768 --> 06:00.728
and 30 weeks in the year,

06:00.729 --> 06:03.231
we lose thousands of minutes.

06:03.232 --> 06:06.217
In other schools,
they do a full work.

06:06.694 --> 06:10.415
Imagine how far ahead they get
in a year

06:10.823 --> 06:12.407
Figure it out!

06:12.408 --> 06:14.261
We never do an hour.

06:14.327 --> 06:16.239
Hand up to speak.

06:17.956 --> 06:20.875
We never do an hour
You always say that!

06:20.876 --> 06:25.524
Teachers say we do an hours class
but we never do.

06:27.466 --> 06:30.677
8.30 to 9.25 doesn't make an hour.

06:30.678 --> 06:33.180
All right it's 55 minutes.

06:33.181 --> 06:35.724
That’s an important point

06:35.725 --> 06:40.896
Stop saying other schools do an hour
They don't!

06:40.897 --> 06:44.901
All I'm saying is that
we waste time. Like now.

06:44.902 --> 06:47.320
To start with,

06:47.321 --> 06:49.027
take out a sheet of paper,

06:49.323 --> 06:52.701
fold it in two so that it can stand

06:52.702 --> 06:55.954
on the edge of your desk clearly

06:55.955 --> 06:59.375
and using block capitals,

06:59.376 --> 07:02.128
write your full name.

07:02.129 --> 07:04.046
Why write our names?

07:04.047 --> 07:05.673
To know who you are

07:05.674 --> 07:08.843
- But you know us!
- We had you last year.

07:08.844 --> 07:12.848
Esmeralda,
half of the kids here are new.

07:12.849 --> 07:16.435
Be happy. That way
people will know your name

07:16.436 --> 07:18.020
I'm not doing it

07:18.021 --> 07:21.065
I won't if you don't

07:21.066 --> 07:22.233
You're right

07:22.234 --> 07:27.030
For those of you who don’t know me,
I'm Mr. Marin

07:27.323 --> 07:29.908
- A marine?
- Very funny

07:29.909 --> 07:32.027
Corny!

07:32.537 --> 07:35.213
He wiped you out, sir

07:35.623 --> 07:38.934
Come on, it shouldn’t take so long

07:40.921 --> 07:43.673
Five minutes to write a name

07:43.674 --> 07:45.939
It's ridiculous

08:08.534 --> 08:11.036
A biscuit for the firs day?

08:11.037 --> 08:13.464
I'm OK, thanks

08:15.416 --> 08:19.182
Rachel, a biscuit will buck you up

08:23.801 --> 08:27.387
All right. "Witty"

08:27.388 --> 08:29.962
That's word
we'll try to explain later.

08:30.474 --> 08:32.476
Are there any other words

08:32.477 --> 08:36.036
that you don't understand?

08:36.481 --> 08:39.817
The word "condescension"

08:39.818 --> 08:42.361
Yes, that's a complicated word.

08:42.362 --> 08:44.489
Do you have any idea

08:44.490 --> 08:46.866
what that might mean?

08:46.867 --> 08:49.235
A vague idea but I'm not sure

08:49.745 --> 08:51.496
You're not sure?

08:51.497 --> 08:54.875
We'll talk about that later then

08:54.876 --> 08:58.462
- Yes, Damien
- "Argentine".

08:58.463 --> 09:01.038
Argentine. What does that mean?

09:01.091 --> 09:04.077
It's people who live in Argentina.

09:04.136 --> 09:06.804
Right, the inhabitants of Argentina

09:06.805 --> 09:09.438
Of course not

09:09.517 --> 09:12.091
Damien, who lives in Argentina?

09:12.103 --> 09:13.729
The Argentines

09:13.730 --> 09:16.565
In a soccer match
Argentina's players

09:16.566 --> 09:18.154
are called...

09:18.527 --> 09:20.232
Footballers

09:21.613 --> 09:22.957
Let's move on

09:23.240 --> 09:27.109
Any other difficult words
in the text?

09:27.787 --> 09:29.130
Henriette

09:30.289 --> 09:35.187
Is there anything
that you didn't understand?

09:38.048 --> 09:39.430
"Henceforth".

09:40.675 --> 09:42.019
"Henceforth".

09:42.177 --> 09:43.928
"Henceforth"

09:43.929 --> 09:47.180
Thanks for the prompt, Samantha.

09:50.144 --> 09:54.523
I think that will do,
Let's take a look at these words.

09:54.524 --> 09:57.359
All right. Austrian

09:57.360 --> 10:01.155
Wey was the one
who picked the word Austrian

10:01.156 --> 10:02.532
Yes, Esmeralda.

10:02.533 --> 10:04.993
We all know what "Austrian" is.

10:04.994 --> 10:08.997
- People from Austria.
- Wey doesn't know and...

10:08.998 --> 10:11.291
Maybe, but everyone else knows!

10:11.292 --> 10:15.671
We get the message. You didn't
know "misleading"

10:15.672 --> 10:19.216
...so you're not really
in any position to talk.

10:19.217 --> 10:21.344
But everyone knows
what "Austrian" means.

10:21.345 --> 10:23.668
Nobody's perfect.

10:25.516 --> 10:28.727
- "Austrian" is not a very,
important word, Wey.

10:28.728 --> 10:32.314
It refers to someone
from the land of Austria,

10:32.315 --> 10:34.858
which is pretty tiny country.

10:34.859 --> 10:37.021
We can live without the word.

10:37.278 --> 10:41.240
Can anyone name a famous Austrian?

10:41.241 --> 10:44.654
Mozart.

10:45.162 --> 10:47.914
- Who?
- Wol Fang Amadeus Mozart.

10:47.915 --> 10:52.002
- "Wol Fung" maybe if he
were English, not Austrian.

10:52.003 --> 10:54.922
Any other famous Austrians?

10:54.923 --> 10:58.335
Austria could vanish
no one would notice.

10:59.261 --> 11:02.638
Seriously, it's south of Germany.
So check a map, Wey,

11:02.639 --> 11:05.725
You'll see where it is.

11:05.726 --> 11:06.550
Souleymane,

11:06.644 --> 11:08.895
...can you note the words too?

11:08.896 --> 11:10.484
I forgot my things.

11:10.898 --> 11:13.483
No one can land you some paper...

11:13.484 --> 11:16.445
I'll do it at home.

11:16.446 --> 11:19.281
You'll do it at home. Sure you will.
That's your approach

11:19.282 --> 11:20.992
Only work at home.

11:20.993 --> 11:22.451
I'm serious!

11:22.452 --> 11:27.290
If I could be sure of that...

11:27.291 --> 11:29.960
Don't worry. It'll be ok

11:29.961 --> 11:33.213
Let's move on to "succulent".

11:33.214 --> 11:36.832
"Succulent" is a word that we'll try
to guess the meaning of.

11:37.469 --> 11:39.053
What's is "succulent"?

11:39.054 --> 11:40.397
Suck

11:40.722 --> 11:42.884
Suck off.

11:43.642 --> 11:45.392
Very funny, Boubacar.

11:45.436 --> 11:46.980
Very witty indeed,

11:48.606 --> 11:50.355
Here's a sentence...

11:51.108 --> 11:53.360
...with "succulent".

11:53.361 --> 11:59.361
"Bill enjoys a succulent..."

12:00.368 --> 12:01.702
"...cheeseburger."

12:01.703 --> 12:03.660
Cheeseburgers stink!

12:04.707 --> 12:06.791
- Who said that?
- Me.

12:06.792 --> 12:08.542
Why "cheeseburger"?

12:09.128 --> 12:15.128
Well, since you say that, you
think cheeseburgers aren't succulent.

12:15.260 --> 12:17.428
Maybe, but they're crap.

12:17.429 --> 12:21.557
OK, but what I just said
should have made the penny drop.

12:21.558 --> 12:23.851
- What does that mean?
- Mean what?

12:23.852 --> 12:25.705
The penny thing...

12:27.273 --> 12:28.565
To make the penny drop,

12:28.566 --> 12:31.777
No one knows the expression?

12:31.778 --> 12:34.196
If the penny drops,
it means you understand.

12:34.197 --> 12:36.115
When I say,

12:36.116 --> 12:40.703
if cheeseburger stink
they're not succulent,

12:40.704 --> 12:44.248
that should help you see
what "succulent" means.

12:44.249 --> 12:47.544
- What's with the Bills?
- What bills?

12:47.545 --> 12:49.030
The name Bill.

12:49.630 --> 12:51.882
You always use weird names.

12:51.883 --> 12:55.344
Weird? A recent US President
was called Bill.

12:55.345 --> 12:59.974
Why don't you use Aissata
or Rachid or Ahmed...

12:59.975 --> 13:02.018
You always use whitey names.

13:02.019 --> 13:03.362
What names?

13:03.437 --> 13:06.791
- Honky names.
- What's honky?

13:07.399 --> 13:10.527
Honkies, Frenchies, frogs.

13:10.528 --> 13:11.820
You're not French?

13:11.821 --> 13:13.526
No, I'm not French.

13:13.656 --> 13:15.142
I didn't know.

13:15.158 --> 13:16.700
I am, but not proud of it.

13:16.701 --> 13:20.162
Fine, I'm not either

13:20.163 --> 13:22.164
Why use these names?

13:22.165 --> 13:26.628
Khoumba, if I start choosing names

13:26.629 --> 13:29.589
to suit all your origins, it'll
never end.

13:29.590 --> 13:31.649
Just change a little!

13:33.344 --> 13:35.712
What do you suggest?

13:35.889 --> 13:38.015
Aissata! Fatou, no!

13:38.016 --> 13:40.796
- No, Aissata.
- Aissata, Aissata!

14:11.010 --> 14:14.555
Excuse me. You have class 4/3
in French?

14:14.556 --> 14:16.473
I'm class supervisor too.

14:16.474 --> 14:19.563
Know what book you'll be reading?

14:19.770 --> 14:22.446
No, I haven't decided.

14:23.065 --> 14:28.069
In history I'll start with
Ancien Regime

14:28.070 --> 14:33.955
If you want to link into that,
what kind of books are there?

14:35.036 --> 14:38.539
The Enlightenment will
be tough for them.

14:38.540 --> 14:41.667
How about Voltaire? Is he tough?

14:41.668 --> 14:43.920
He's not easy.

14:43.921 --> 14:45.626
Candide, is simple...

14:46.674 --> 14:48.586
Not in their year

14:48.884 --> 14:50.370
Zadig...

14:50.970 --> 14:55.148
Yes, but it'd be tough

15:29.387 --> 15:30.762
You have 20 seconds.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.676
No, we've not finished yet!

15:33.057 --> 15:35.559
We've not finished yet!

15:35.560 --> 15:38.134
We can't spend 2 hours on the
imperfect.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.137
Dalla, I can give you the time.

15:47.448 --> 15:49.462
Sir, my pen keeps leaking!

15:49.992 --> 15:52.160
- It's crap
- Who has a handkerchief?

15:52.161 --> 15:53.647
Me!

15:54.080 --> 15:55.006
Rabah!

15:55.081 --> 15:58.228
Ask before you stand.

15:59.336 --> 16:01.865
- May I?
- Yes.

16:03.841 --> 16:06.718
- Gently, Ok...
- The perv!

16:06.719 --> 16:08.094
He touched her tits!

16:08.095 --> 16:10.472
Just give him the handkerchief.

16:10.473 --> 16:13.600
Spare us your comments.

16:13.601 --> 16:15.969
God dam pedophile!

16:16.980 --> 16:19.922
- Quiet!
- Sir?

16:20.317 --> 16:24.656
Why the imperfect indicative?

16:25.030 --> 16:27.991
Cut it out!

16:27.992 --> 16:31.953
- Why not just imperfect?
- Quiet, Souleymane.

16:31.954 --> 16:35.165
All right, Esmeralda,
why the indicative?

16:35.166 --> 16:38.586
If I knew, I wouldn't ask.

16:38.587 --> 16:43.633
I can imagine. Anyone know why we
specify the imperfect indicative?

16:43.634 --> 16:45.927
Why not just the imperfect?

16:45.928 --> 16:48.930
Nassim?
May I wash my hands?

16:48.931 --> 16:51.873
Go on, wash them and get it over with.

16:52.059 --> 16:54.019
Make it quick.

16:54.020 --> 16:56.035
He'll take a week!

16:56.856 --> 16:58.871
- I'll go with him.
- Enough

16:59.276 --> 17:00.761
The imperfect indicative is

17:02.571 --> 17:05.881
different than another imperfect

17:06.408 --> 17:08.365
Which imperfect is that?

17:08.703 --> 17:11.580
Agam?
- The imperfect subjunctive.

17:11.581 --> 17:12.914
Exactly.

17:12.915 --> 17:18.344
The Imperfect subjunctive.
Can anyone give me an example?

17:19.714 --> 17:22.383
I don't believe it, Khoumba,
but go on.

17:22.384 --> 17:26.679
I may be wrong...

17:26.680 --> 17:28.306
I think so too.

17:28.307 --> 17:30.308
- I were
- I were.

17:30.309 --> 17:32.561
From the verb "to werr"

17:32.562 --> 17:34.646
- I don't know...
- I wuz.

17:34.647 --> 17:37.358
I were, we were, you were

17:37.359 --> 17:41.445
All right. Not bad but you use it
wrongly.

17:41.446 --> 17:46.576
You vaguely recall
the imperfect subjunctive.

17:46.577 --> 17:48.745
Imagine I say:

17:48.746 --> 17:51.623
"He insist..."

17:51.624 --> 17:54.301
"that I be..."

17:55.879 --> 17:59.465
Let's say "in shape".
"He insists that I be in shape"

17:59.466 --> 18:02.593
What is "be" in that example?

18:02.594 --> 18:04.846
The present subjunctive.

18:04.847 --> 18:08.349
Very good. For the imperfect
subjunctive,

18:08.350 --> 18:12.521
we follow the sequence of tenses
and use a past:

18:12.522 --> 18:13.897
"He insisted..."

18:13.898 --> 18:16.775
- "He insisted that I..."
Khoumba?

18:16.776 --> 18:19.111
- Were.
- Were. Yes.

18:19.112 --> 18:21.697
You really think I'll tell my mom:

18:21.698 --> 18:25.410
"He insisted that I were'd been in shape?"

18:25.411 --> 18:29.122
Not I were'd been.
Learn to use it first

18:29.123 --> 18:31.875
"That I were in shape"

18:31.876 --> 18:34.920
- The sequence of tenses.
- No one says that.

18:34.921 --> 18:37.464
I was right!

18:37.465 --> 18:40.009
"I were".

18:40.010 --> 18:43.513
Will you let me answer the question?

18:43.514 --> 18:45.932
If you care.
- You may.

18:45.933 --> 18:50.604
- Before mastering something,
the imperfect subjunctive,

18:50.605 --> 18:53.607
you're telling me it's no use.

18:53.608 --> 18:56.568
Start by mastering it,

18:56.569 --> 19:00.239
then you can call its use into question.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.783
Sir, why are you criticizing us?

19:02.784 --> 19:07.205
They're right, that's the way
people talked in the old days.

19:07.206 --> 19:10.083
Even my gran didn't say that.

19:10.084 --> 19:13.170
Or your great granddad
It's from the Middle Ages!

19:13.171 --> 19:14.963
No it isn't.

19:14.964 --> 19:16.840
It is!

19:16.841 --> 19:18.300
It's bourgeois...

19:18.301 --> 19:23.181
Tell me, when was the last time

19:23.182 --> 19:24.807
you heard someone talk like that?

19:24.808 --> 19:28.436
Yesterday, with friends,
we used the imperfect subjunctive.

19:28.437 --> 19:30.021
No, someone normal!

19:30.022 --> 19:33.191
All right, all right.

19:33.192 --> 19:35.861
The people on the streets...

19:35.862 --> 19:38.539
Can I reply?

19:40.200 --> 19:41.543
Yep.

19:41.702 --> 19:44.495
I'll talk this over, but calmly.

19:44.496 --> 19:48.291
All right, not everyone talks that way.

19:48.292 --> 19:51.378
In fact, people who do are pretty rare.

19:51.379 --> 19:54.298
I'd even say only snobs...

19:54.299 --> 19:57.676
...use the imperfect subjunctive.

19:57.677 --> 19:59.970
What's a snob?

19:59.971 --> 20:04.267
Snobs are slightly affected,
slightly precious people

20:04.268 --> 20:06.853
who tend to put on airs.

20:06.854 --> 20:08.197
Homosexuals?

20:09.523 --> 20:12.304
No, not homosexuals...

20:12.610 --> 20:14.528
You can be affected and refined

20:14.529 --> 20:18.073
without being homosexual.

20:18.074 --> 20:20.201
In any case,

20:20.202 --> 20:24.580
this register may seem
formal and a bit affected,

20:24.581 --> 20:26.875
and even bourgeois.

20:26.876 --> 20:30.879
But these different registers exist

20:30.880 --> 20:33.173
...as I keep telling you,

20:33.174 --> 20:37.428
...you need to be able to use them

20:37.429 --> 20:39.972
...Familiar, current, formal,
oral and written.

20:39.973 --> 20:42.505
Move between them
and use them all. Yes, Lucie?

20:42.517 --> 20:47.313
How do we know what's written
and what's for oral?

20:47.314 --> 20:50.317
Why is a word more one for one register?

20:50.318 --> 20:53.111
Normally, that's something

20:53.112 --> 20:57.039
that you pick up as you go along

20:57.117 --> 21:00.619
You need to use intuition.

21:00.620 --> 21:02.788
What's this?

21:02.789 --> 21:06.584
Intuition is when you can't use thinking

21:06.585 --> 21:10.547
When you can't really...

21:10.548 --> 21:13.258
It's not knowing
but more like sensing something.

21:13.259 --> 21:15.583
When you sense things

21:16.054 --> 21:18.275
What if you don't sense?

21:19.141 --> 21:21.892
If you don't sense them, well...

21:21.893 --> 21:25.271
You gain intuition
by using the language.

21:25.272 --> 21:28.817
That's when you learn to distinguish...

21:28.818 --> 21:32.230
almost automatically
between oral and written styles.

21:32.530 --> 21:35.824
- Souleymane wants to say something.
- Shut it.

21:35.825 --> 21:37.701
What does he want to say?

21:37.702 --> 21:39.188
Go on!

21:39.329 --> 21:42.683
Calm down

21:43.625 --> 21:45.668
Cut it out. No fighting

21:45.669 --> 21:48.338
- I'll whop you
- Don't act tough!

21:48.339 --> 21:52.678
What's wrong? Boubacar, turn around.

21:54.053 --> 21:56.377
- What is it?
- Nothing

21:56.389 --> 22:00.729
- Apparently not.
- Don't send him to the principal.

22:01.144 --> 22:03.938
If I tell you,
I'm good for Guantanamo.

22:03.939 --> 22:05.732
Guantanamo! Guantanamo!

22:05.733 --> 22:07.115
I'll be tased!

22:07.151 --> 22:08.494
You won't be tased.

22:09.946 --> 22:11.655
- You have a question?
- Yep

22:11.656 --> 22:12.823
So ask it

22:12.824 --> 22:16.160
- It's too wicked
- It's not

22:16.161 --> 22:18.370
It's the pits for you
- Just ask it

22:18.371 --> 22:20.414
- I have your word?
- Hurry up

22:20.415 --> 22:24.252
This is what I heard, ok?
I didn't say it but I heard...

22:24.253 --> 22:27.607
People say you like men.

22:32.345 --> 22:34.096
I didn't say it!

22:34.097 --> 22:37.057
- Who says that?
- Just people

22:37.058 --> 22:39.393
"They say Mr. Marin likes men"

22:39.394 --> 22:41.556
Others say that, not you?

22:41.563 --> 22:44.232
- You not interested?
- No way

22:44.233 --> 22:46.818
- So why do you ask?
- For the others.

22:46.819 --> 22:48.445
I'm spokesman

22:48.446 --> 22:52.109
- But you don't care?
- If you like men, fine

22:53.034 --> 22:56.120
- So is it true?
- You are asking me.

22:56.121 --> 22:59.475
Homosexual isn’t an insult, sir.

23:00.250 --> 23:02.877
You say it isn't but it seems
to be a problem for you.

23:02.878 --> 23:06.756
You find it odd, men liking men.

23:06.757 --> 23:10.760
Maybe it is, I don't know
It is true or not?

23:10.761 --> 23:13.263
No, it's not. Feel better now?

23:13.264 --> 23:14.608
Yeah? Sure.

23:17.310 --> 23:19.678
Sorry to disappoint you.

23:21.440 --> 23:24.650
All right, if Souleymane doesn't mind

23:24.651 --> 23:27.153
now he's settle his hang-ups,

23:27.154 --> 23:30.038
let's get back
to the imperfect indicative.

23:34.871 --> 23:37.092
Yeah, like that! Not bad

23:43.172 --> 23:44.964
- What are you doing?
- Stop.

23:44.965 --> 23:46.671
- What's up?
- Get lost

23:50.930 --> 23:53.890
Who asked you? Look at your mug
- Get lost

23:53.891 --> 23:56.185
- It's fucking ok!
Take these jerks,

23:56.186 --> 23:57.686
then we'll see

23:57.687 --> 24:00.022
Go on, show me your backs

24:00.023 --> 24:03.170
- These guys suck.
- Another one.

24:03.193 --> 24:05.987
- Classy display
- You bet

24:05.988 --> 24:08.615
- Got one for me?
- Can't afford it

24:08.616 --> 24:10.325
- How much?
- Too much!

24:10.326 --> 24:13.371
Stop thinking I'm broke like you!

24:18.376 --> 24:22.421
She screwed up there
She thinks it's regular verb

24:22.422 --> 24:25.099
No the verb's swim. Swimmed.

24:32.725 --> 24:36.447
Justine! "Swimmed"!

24:37.772 --> 24:40.199
Justine, work it out yourself

24:41.693 --> 24:45.724
Swummed. That's better,
it mixes the two.

24:45.823 --> 24:48.499
Swammed!

24:50.828 --> 24:54.388
She put swemmed

24:56.543 --> 25:00.264
- Ok, thank you
- Try swommed

25:00.797 --> 25:03.268
You can sit down

25:03.550 --> 25:04.759
Let's see.

25:04.760 --> 25:06.594
Let's see

25:06.595 --> 25:08.552
She can’t write

25:09.056 --> 25:11.516
She can’t write? Can you, Rabah?

25:11.517 --> 25:13.393
- You bet
- Go on then

25:13.394 --> 25:15.409
Conjugate it properly

25:17.857 --> 25:19.201
- Swummed
- No

25:20.152 --> 25:21.799
Continue.

25:24.698 --> 25:26.950
Swammed

25:26.951 --> 25:28.294
Wrong again

25:30.705 --> 25:33.790
Just kidding

25:33.791 --> 25:36.262
- It’s not like that
- So what is it?

25:38.880 --> 25:40.528
Without an I

25:40.716 --> 25:42.774
Right, no I

25:43.552 --> 25:46.137
Why make fun of Justine,

25:46.138 --> 25:49.391
when you can’t do better?

25:49.392 --> 25:52.644
Justine wasn’t so wrong

25:52.645 --> 25:55.896
That’s enough

25:58.818 --> 26:02.530
You cant focus for more
than 20 seconds

26:02.531 --> 26:04.178
like 3 year olds

26:04.366 --> 26:08.286
People aged 14 or 15
like you’re supposed to be

26:08.287 --> 26:11.748
If I ask a question
they should know

26:11.749 --> 26:14.501
Your kidding around goes too far!

26:14.502 --> 26:15.878
Not at all

26:15.879 --> 26:18.255
- Everyone thinks so
- Dead right

26:18.256 --> 26:21.509
Everyone thinks so
or only you think so?

26:21.510 --> 26:23.010
No, everyone!

26:23.011 --> 26:26.306
I think you push it.

26:26.307 --> 26:31.812
If I cut you some slack,
you'll never get anywhere

26:31.813 --> 26:33.939
You go too far!

26:33.940 --> 26:36.617
And you know why

26:39.946 --> 26:43.950
I’m sick of these clowns!
Sick of them!

26:43.951 --> 26:46.578
I can’t take any more

26:46.579 --> 26:50.332
They’re nothing,
they know nothing...

26:50.333 --> 26:54.044
they look right through you
when you try to teach them

26:54.045 --> 26:56.004
They cat stay in their shit

26:56.005 --> 26:57.962
I’m not going to help them

26:59.259 --> 27:02.261
They’re so basic, so insincere

27:02.262 --> 27:04.389
...always looking for trouble

27:04.390 --> 27:06.099
Go ahead, guys

27:06.100 --> 27:08.435
...Stay in your crap neighborhood

27:08.436 --> 27:12.606
You’ll be here all yours lives
and it serves you right

27:12.607 --> 27:18.195
Ill see the principal and tell him
I’m not working with 3/2 again.

27:18.196 --> 27:22.533
No more technology
for the rest of the year. Too bad

27:22.534 --> 27:26.829
It’s been three months now and
they haven’t done a single thing

27:26.830 --> 27:31.001
Have you seen them in the yard?
It’s like they’re in heat

27:31.002 --> 27:34.880
They’re all over each other,
like animals

27:34.881 --> 27:36.058
It’s crazy. It’s the same in class

27:36.132 --> 27:40.207
Kevin spent a whole hour doing

27:40.929 --> 27:45.827
I’ve never seen the like
of it in 5 years!

27:49.146 --> 27:52.397
Enough, no more!

27:52.442 --> 27:55.427
We’re not animals!

28:01.535 --> 28:03.653
Sorry I’m...

28:05.456 --> 28:07.205
It’s dumb.

28:11.754 --> 28:15.724
Come on. Let's get some air

28:24.476 --> 28:27.187
One extract isn’t a lot to read

28:27.188 --> 28:29.555
No one did it?

28:31.984 --> 28:34.412
We’re wasting time here

28:34.821 --> 28:36.983
Let’s read it again then

28:38.074 --> 28:39.662
Who wants to read?

28:42.788 --> 28:46.624
Great! Excellent work
atmosphere today.

28:46.625 --> 28:48.434
Khoumba, go on.

28:49.086 --> 28:50.430
No way.

28:51.130 --> 28:52.474
You won’t read?

28:52.673 --> 28:54.630
I don’t want to

28:54.634 --> 28:57.761
The class revolves
around your desires?

28:57.762 --> 29:00.954
- I don’t want to read
- Don’t care

29:02.768 --> 29:04.886
What did Khoumba just do?

29:05.354 --> 29:07.272
- Wey?
- Sneer

29:07.273 --> 29:10.442
I meant her attitude,
What did she show?

29:10.443 --> 29:12.914
Insolence.

29:13.237 --> 29:15.561
That’s right, you’re an expert

29:18.702 --> 29:22.330
You’re all angrulo with me

29:22.331 --> 29:24.415
What is this?
- That’s not true

29:24.416 --> 29:28.034
Try saying it in French. What am I?

29:28.337 --> 29:29.671
Angrulo

29:29.672 --> 29:31.381
Say it in everyday French

29:31.382 --> 29:33.968
- You’ve got it in for me
- That’s normal French

29:38.306 --> 29:39.932
I just want you to read

29:39.933 --> 29:43.269
I have the right to ask you
to read, don’t I?

29:43.270 --> 29:45.123
Don’t you think so?
- No.

29:45.856 --> 29:46.940
No one has read it

29:46.941 --> 29:49.818
and you’re picking on me.

29:49.819 --> 29:51.695
I’m not. I want to work

29:51.696 --> 29:54.740
and I’ve chosen you
as I have the rights to.

29:54.741 --> 29:56.084
Drop it.

29:56.117 --> 29:58.577
Shut up and start reading

29:58.578 --> 30:00.162
I won’t read

30:00.163 --> 30:04.208
You tell me to shut up,
then to read. What is this?

30:04.209 --> 30:05.651
What’s what?

30:05.669 --> 30:07.128
Make your mind up,

30:07.129 --> 30:08.713
Think it through

30:08.714 --> 30:11.424
Well talk it over after class

30:11.425 --> 30:13.484
It won’t be fun
- Sure

30:13.678 --> 30:16.311
You won’t say that later

30:16.848 --> 30:21.227
Esmeralda, are you on strike too
or can you read for us?

30:21.228 --> 30:23.020
It’s her life

30:23.021 --> 30:26.024
In that case, will you read for us?

30:26.025 --> 30:28.276
I'd be delighted to

30:28.277 --> 30:30.195
All right, were listening

30:30.196 --> 30:31.446
"Dear Kitty"

30:31.447 --> 30:35.117
I’m known as a bundle
of contradictions.

30:35.118 --> 30:37.703
"As I’ve told you several times...

30:37.704 --> 30:40.664
..."my soul is split in two

30:40.665 --> 30:43.417
"my mocking approach to
everything, my joy in life,

30:43.418 --> 30:45.378
..."On one side

30:45.379 --> 30:47.130
my exuberant cheerfulness

30:47.131 --> 30:50.759
..."and my ability
to take things lightly

30:50.760 --> 30:54.763
"By that I mean not seeing
any wrong in flirting...

30:54.764 --> 30:58.642
..."giving a kiss, embracing someone,

30:58.643 --> 31:01.423
..."or telling a tasteless joke

31:01.480 --> 31:04.816
"That side lies in wait
pushing back the other side...

31:04.817 --> 31:09.571
"..." which is more beautiful,
purer and deeper.

31:09.572 --> 31:11.531
"The truth is that no one knows,

31:11.532 --> 31:14.368
..."Anne's better side...

31:14.369 --> 31:16.495
..."and that's why most people...

31:16.496 --> 31:17.913
..."can't stand me.

31:17.914 --> 31:22.251
"I can be an amusing clown
for an afternoon

31:22.252 --> 31:26.005
..."but then everyone

31:26.006 --> 31:29.884
"has had enough of me,

31:29.885 --> 31:31.866
..."So the nice Anne has never once,

31:31.888 --> 31:33.013
..."been seen in company

31:33.014 --> 31:36.684
"But, in her loneliness,
she always triumphs."

31:36.685 --> 31:39.436
"My best to you. Anne Franck.
Anne's diary ends here"

31:39.437 --> 31:41.230
It ends here. Why?

31:41.231 --> 31:45.109
Because the police turned up
at the rooms

31:45.110 --> 31:47.862
...where they were hiding
and deported them.

31:47.863 --> 31:49.305
She died shortly after

31:49.323 --> 31:53.452
...That's what I asked earlier
We talked about it.

31:53.453 --> 31:56.246
I learn about Anne Frank

31:56.247 --> 32:00.459
because she talks about herself
and so I get to know her.

32:00.460 --> 32:04.881
When I ask you to write
your own self-portraits,

32:04.882 --> 32:06.799
...I'll expect the same.

32:06.800 --> 32:10.720
...In other words, to learn things
through your feelings,

32:10.721 --> 32:13.663
...You can talk about facts...

32:13.850 --> 32:18.910
...that will allow
me to know you better.

32:19.773 --> 32:22.108
Yes, Lucie?

32:22.109 --> 32:24.235
What we write

32:24.236 --> 32:30.158
won't be as gripping as...
as what Anne Franck wrote

32:30.159 --> 32:33.870
Our lives aren't as gripping.
- All right

32:33.871 --> 32:35.215
Juliette?

32:36.499 --> 32:40.169
Someone aged 70
could talk about their life,

32:40.170 --> 32:45.425
...but we have nothing to tell at 13,

32:45.426 --> 32:49.137
At 14, 15 or even 13
you've had experiences

32:49.138 --> 32:52.963
- Less then someone aged 70
They’ve live a lot more.

32:54.477 --> 32:56.270
- OK
- They’ve seen life.

32:56.271 --> 33:00.357
It’s funny. You don’t think
your lives are interesting.

33:00.358 --> 33:04.183
We just come to school, go home,
eat and sleep.

33:04.822 --> 33:07.866
You come to school, eat, sleep, fine

33:07.867 --> 33:10.911
The bare facts of your life are dull

33:10.912 --> 33:15.040
But what you feel is interesting
- That’s my business

33:15.041 --> 33:17.668
Maybe, but I’m interested

33:17.669 --> 33:19.545
That’s different

33:19.546 --> 33:21.134
Why is it different?

33:22.090 --> 33:24.665
Because you're a teacher.

33:24.885 --> 33:27.011
It’s not the teacher talking.

33:27.012 --> 33:29.234
- It’s the human being
- It’s your job

33:31.809 --> 33:35.270
I think you’re only saying that
to get us to talk and stuff

33:35.271 --> 33:37.433
...but its not true.

33:38.608 --> 33:40.040
It isn’t? What isn’t true?

33:40.110 --> 33:44.947
The fact that you’re interested
in knowing all that

33:44.948 --> 33:47.033
So I’m not interested at all

33:47.034 --> 33:49.619
...and I’m pushing at this

33:49.620 --> 33:51.913
...to convince you its interesting?

33:51.914 --> 33:55.062
Not as much as you say

33:55.084 --> 33:58.276
Maybe I am exaggerating a little.

33:58.547 --> 34:02.508
It’s only natural since
you don’t agree with me

34:02.509 --> 34:05.053
But, deep down, I’m totally sincere

34:05.054 --> 34:09.099
Why it is such a problem for you

34:09.100 --> 34:11.768
...to talk about your lives?
Boubacar.

34:11.769 --> 34:14.093
Well there stuff...

34:15.064 --> 34:17.021
There’s private stuff.

34:17.025 --> 34:19.610
Of course

34:19.611 --> 34:24.465
What could be hard to say
about your private lives?

34:24.491 --> 34:25.461
Burak.

34:25.534 --> 34:29.300
- We may be ashamed
to say certain things

34:29.705 --> 34:32.207
Yes, it has to do with shame.

34:32.208 --> 34:36.444
Things you find it hard to say
and even harder to write.

34:37.839 --> 34:40.424
On your life, when were you ashamed?

34:40.425 --> 34:44.095
You can be ashamed of pal's mom...

34:44.096 --> 34:47.243
Why? Because you find her ugly?

34:49.143 --> 34:52.104
No. For instance, Rabah's mom,

34:52.105 --> 34:54.481
She offered me lunch but I refused

34:54.482 --> 34:56.188
because I was ashamed

34:56.568 --> 34:58.273
Ashamed to eat with her?

34:58.570 --> 35:01.408
Because it’s beneath you?
- No.

35:01.615 --> 35:04.325
I don’t understand, Tell me why.

35:04.326 --> 35:08.580
I’m ashamed to eat with her
because I respect her.

35:08.581 --> 35:11.958
You never eat with people who
you respect?

35:11.959 --> 35:15.416
I mean, she’s not my girlfriend!

35:15.880 --> 35:20.176
You can only eat with
a girlfriend...

35:20.177 --> 35:22.678
Tell me why. I’m interested

35:22.679 --> 35:25.598
I can’t explain it.
In any case, I’m ashamed

35:25.599 --> 35:29.811
I always hang out with Rabah

35:29.812 --> 35:32.397
so I respect his mom

35:32.398 --> 35:34.207
I don’t eat in front of her

35:34.484 --> 35:38.946
So if Boubacar eats in front of us
he doesn’t respects us

35:38.947 --> 35:40.756
No, it’s not that!

35:42.409 --> 35:46.329
- You can’t understand.
- I’m not smart enough?

35:46.330 --> 35:49.165
You just can’t understand.

35:49.166 --> 35:50.034
Rabah?

35:50.126 --> 35:53.003
I was at a party with Camemberters

35:53.004 --> 35:54.880
Camemberters?

35:54.881 --> 35:56.173
Yeah, like you

35:56.174 --> 35:57.517
What's a Camemberter?

35:57.759 --> 36:00.136
Someone who stinks of cheese

36:00.137 --> 36:04.432
So the people at the party
stank of cheese?

36:04.433 --> 36:06.935
They were all in suits and ties.

36:06.936 --> 36:10.188
I was in my baggies and
got these weird looks

36:10.189 --> 36:12.065
You were ashamed?

36:12.066 --> 36:13.650
Because of the looks

36:13.651 --> 36:16.487
They were embarrassed because of you

36:16.488 --> 36:18.405
...and you felt the same

36:18.406 --> 36:20.074
They weren’t embarrassed

36:20.075 --> 36:23.453
They looked at me
like I was an E.T.

36:23.454 --> 36:24.662
You are an E.T.!

36:24.663 --> 36:26.789
"Why’s that Arab here?"

36:26.790 --> 36:28.833
Ok, so it was a race thing

36:28.834 --> 36:31.753
I don’t know

36:31.754 --> 36:34.490
But the snacks were bacon-flavored

36:36.968 --> 36:39.804
So I... abstained

36:39.805 --> 36:44.142
Right. Bacon, ham... Ok, I get it

36:44.143 --> 36:45.435
Wey...

36:45.436 --> 36:48.480
Young people now have no shame.

36:48.481 --> 36:50.908
Young people now? Like you?

36:50.983 --> 36:52.109
Yeah

36:52.110 --> 36:55.464
- Drop your briefs!
- They have no shame

36:55.572 --> 36:58.455
It’s normal. Always normal

36:58.491 --> 37:00.242
Are you like them?

37:00.243 --> 37:02.161
- No.
- Are you ashamed?

37:02.162 --> 37:04.633
Yes, ashamed of them.

37:07.168 --> 37:09.433
I’ll waste your ugly mug!

37:11.005 --> 37:14.967
Anyone can speak, but
you stay polite, OK.

37:14.968 --> 37:18.053
So why are you ashamed for them?

37:18.054 --> 37:21.349
They have no shame

37:21.350 --> 37:23.893
They yell, they hit each other.
They make jokes,

37:23.894 --> 37:26.321
bother others. No shame

37:26.397 --> 37:28.440
Wey, aren’t you confusing

37:28.441 --> 37:30.150
shame and discipline?

37:30.151 --> 37:32.694
You find the others...

37:32.695 --> 37:34.571
rowdy and impolite.

37:34.572 --> 37:38.033
It can be shameful too

37:38.034 --> 37:38.755
Louise?

37:38.869 --> 37:41.370
You can be ashamed of your appearance

37:41.371 --> 37:44.123
Absolutely

37:44.124 --> 37:47.001
Tell me Louise

37:47.002 --> 37:49.988
what are you ashamed of?

37:52.592 --> 37:54.259
My ears

37:54.260 --> 37:55.719
Your ears?

37:55.720 --> 37:58.088
Can we see? You’re ashamed of your ears?

37:59.307 --> 38:01.517
What’s wrong with them?

38:01.518 --> 38:03.770
They stick out

38:03.771 --> 38:06.439
- You think they stick out
- Mine too

38:06.440 --> 38:08.483
I think that covers it all.

38:08.484 --> 38:12.112
You have all you need
to figure it out

38:12.113 --> 38:15.467
Take out your exercise books.

38:16.242 --> 38:21.920
Note the following exercise
for next Thursday

38:24.376 --> 38:29.392
It’s very simple:
Write your self portrait.

38:34.429 --> 38:36.847
A self-portrait
isn’t an autobiography.

38:36.848 --> 38:40.601
I don’t want your life story

38:40.602 --> 38:43.235
Describe yourself and your personality.

38:44.815 --> 38:46.399
We’ll read them in class

38:46.400 --> 38:49.489
...and see how we can use them

39:00.040 --> 39:02.305
Khoumba.

39:02.459 --> 39:05.504
You know I want to see you

39:10.676 --> 39:12.761
Give me your report book

39:12.762 --> 39:13.732
Why?

39:13.805 --> 39:16.070
You know why.

39:21.605 --> 39:24.691
No, give it to me. Politely.

39:24.692 --> 39:26.913
That’s enough now

39:26.986 --> 39:30.296
Put your photo on it

39:35.119 --> 39:37.788
Is it normal to refuse to read

39:37.789 --> 39:40.124
when teacher asks you to?
Is that normal?

39:40.125 --> 39:42.585
There’s others in the class.

39:42.586 --> 39:45.129
I can’t turn a blind eye to this.

39:45.130 --> 39:46.631
Can I?

39:46.632 --> 39:48.220
OK.

39:51.053 --> 39:53.995
What happened this summer?

39:54.849 --> 39:57.267
What happened during the vacation?

39:57.268 --> 39:59.228
- I didn’t see you
- I know.

39:59.229 --> 40:00.813
I’m intrigued.

40:00.814 --> 40:02.481
At the end of the year in June

40:02.482 --> 40:05.234
...we’d gotten on pretty well together

40:05.235 --> 40:08.071
You participated in class.

40:08.072 --> 40:10.740
Since September,
since the start of this year,

40:10.741 --> 40:13.316
You’re not cooperative,

40:13.453 --> 40:17.331
...You keep sulking,
You refuse to read... What happened?

40:17.332 --> 40:20.751
I don’t like reading now.
Can you hurry, please?

40:20.752 --> 40:23.076
No, I won’t hurry!

40:29.512 --> 40:30.846
Explain.

40:30.847 --> 40:34.308
Why have things changed
all of a sudden?

40:34.309 --> 40:36.780
I can’t stay a kid forever

40:37.312 --> 40:39.939
So it’s a kid thing to cooperate?

40:39.940 --> 40:42.900
That's it
- There's others in the class.

40:42.901 --> 40:44.960
Of course, when you work, it's

40:47.239 --> 40:48.948
I haven’t finished.

40:48.949 --> 40:50.784
My moms waiting for me

40:50.785 --> 40:53.286
I want an apology first

40:53.287 --> 40:56.171
An apology for what you did

40:56.583 --> 40:59.043
"I apologize for
being insolent, sir"

40:59.044 --> 40:59.808
Sorry. Ok?

40:59.961 --> 41:02.505
No, not sorry.

41:02.506 --> 41:05.008
"I apologize for being insolent"

41:05.009 --> 41:06.494
Go ahead

41:07.762 --> 41:09.888
"I apologize, sir"

41:09.889 --> 41:12.974
- "No, I apologize
for being insolent"

41:12.975 --> 41:15.602
Be sincere. I want a real apology

41:15.603 --> 41:17.855
Can you hurry up, please?

41:17.856 --> 41:20.316
- My moms waiting
- For your apology

41:20.317 --> 41:21.776
Let’s deal with this

41:21.777 --> 41:23.861
I want a sincere apology

41:23.862 --> 41:27.157
...that’ll stand for the rest of the year

41:27.158 --> 41:29.200
We won’t go on like this

41:29.201 --> 41:33.481
I apologize for being insolent.

41:34.123 --> 41:35.467
More conviction!

41:36.543 --> 41:38.961
I’m not saying it 50 times

41:38.962 --> 41:41.380
- You two,
What are you up to?

41:41.381 --> 41:43.758
We’re waiting

41:43.759 --> 41:45.969
Hurry, I’m listening

41:45.970 --> 41:48.638
I apologize for being insolent.

41:48.639 --> 41:50.125
May I go now, please?

41:58.525 --> 42:00.069
I didn’t mean it

42:11.456 --> 42:15.751
Two weeks ago, at the last meeting

42:15.752 --> 42:17.973
the teachers suggested

42:18.588 --> 42:22.592
introducing a penalty point system
for the students

42:22.593 --> 42:26.095
...based on the driving license system

42:26.096 --> 42:29.140
If student broke a rule

42:29.141 --> 42:31.601
...they would lose points

42:31.602 --> 42:34.980
As its teachers idea,
I’ll let them to speak

42:34.981 --> 42:39.527
Since last September...

42:39.528 --> 42:42.613
...we’ve noticed an increase
in problems within the school.

42:42.614 --> 42:45.867
Punishment has no effect
on the students

42:45.868 --> 42:47.494
So we had the idea

42:47.495 --> 42:49.037
...of a penalty system

42:49.038 --> 42:53.834
The students would have
for example six points each

42:53.835 --> 42:58.380
and depending on the misdeed
they’d lose one or two points.

42:58.381 --> 43:00.841
And when they run out of points?

43:00.842 --> 43:04.262
They go before the disciplinary committee.

43:04.263 --> 43:06.848
As a parents representative...

43:06.849 --> 43:11.853
...this is typical
of the schools bad habits...

43:11.854 --> 43:14.693
You always condemn the students...

43:15.275 --> 43:17.067
...but never praise them

43:17.068 --> 43:19.445
They earn praise on their own

43:19.446 --> 43:23.533
They do it with their grades,
by moving up a class

43:23.534 --> 43:26.202
and we do it in staff meetings...

43:26.203 --> 43:28.955
...by encouraging them to work.

43:28.956 --> 43:33.293
There’s the honor roll,
the congratulations.

43:33.294 --> 43:34.962
that all counts.

43:34.963 --> 43:36.880
In your system

43:36.881 --> 43:39.633
...you take away points for misdeeds

43:39.634 --> 43:41.344
but why not further

43:41.345 --> 43:44.847
...and give points to those
who do good things?

43:44.848 --> 43:46.891
Like gold stars.

43:46.892 --> 43:49.686
I’m all for praising the students.

43:49.687 --> 43:54.149
but if student collect points
and end up with 34 points, say,

43:54.150 --> 43:58.153
...That leaves room
for all kinds of trouble,

43:58.154 --> 43:59.572
...we can’t control

43:59.573 --> 44:02.491
Without going as far...

44:02.492 --> 44:03.785
as these imaginary 34 points

44:03.786 --> 44:07.247
...six points to start with,

44:07.248 --> 44:10.667
means they can cause trouble
without punishment.

44:10.668 --> 44:15.214
Losing a point or two
isn’t a real punishment.

44:15.215 --> 44:18.759
It can create
a dangerous sense of impunity.

44:18.760 --> 44:22.430
For me, the ideas
totally wrong-headed.

44:22.431 --> 44:23.873
In that case,

44:23.891 --> 44:25.850
...we could find a punishment

44:25.851 --> 44:30.294
...where the students
lose all their points in one go...

44:31.482 --> 44:35.866
But why bother with the points
in that case?

44:35.904 --> 44:38.113
It’s tricky

44:38.114 --> 44:40.408
- What you call a sense of impunity
gives us a room to maneuver,

44:40.409 --> 44:43.744
...When you’re dealing
with punishments.

44:43.745 --> 44:48.750
that are cut and dried,

44:48.751 --> 44:51.711
you can’t adapt them to each case

44:51.712 --> 44:53.839
I don’t agree

44:53.840 --> 44:55.424
The rules apply in the same way

44:55.425 --> 44:57.801
...to all the students

44:57.802 --> 44:59.929
They break them, they’re punished

44:59.930 --> 45:02.890
If not, why bother with rules?

45:02.891 --> 45:05.727
Dealing with extremely strict rules

45:05.728 --> 45:07.562
...creates the greatest tension...

45:07.563 --> 45:09.230
Take cell phones

45:09.231 --> 45:13.443
We agreed on a rule...

45:13.444 --> 45:14.820
...that cell phones
were not allowed in class

45:14.821 --> 45:17.323
Sorry, but I break that rule

45:17.324 --> 45:19.992
...because it wasn’t problem for me

45:19.993 --> 45:23.287
There’s room to be tolerant.

45:23.288 --> 45:25.612
The reign of the arbitrary.

45:25.749 --> 45:28.585
No, the law
and the spirit of the law.

45:28.586 --> 45:31.797
We could talk all night
but its not possible

45:31.798 --> 45:34.967
We have other topics to tackle.

45:34.968 --> 45:40.014
In particular, one vital issue,

45:40.015 --> 45:44.769
a very sensitive one,
concerning the staff coffee machine.

45:44.770 --> 45:48.022
It’s a sensitive issue, all right

45:48.023 --> 45:53.038
There’s a real problem this year...

45:54.322 --> 45:58.158
...The price of a coffee has gone up
from 40 centimes

45:58.159 --> 46:00.119
to 50 centimes

46:00.120 --> 46:02.413
That may seem petty...

46:02.414 --> 46:04.040
...but with several coffees a day,

46:04.041 --> 46:07.585
...at 8, 10 or 4
in the afternoon...

46:07.586 --> 46:12.132
it works out a lot

46:12.133 --> 46:15.324
...So we've clubbed together
to buy a coffee maker.

46:16.346 --> 46:20.474
- That way we can drink
as much coffee as we want...

46:20.475 --> 46:24.645
...without having to count.

46:24.646 --> 46:28.149
- Mr. Pierre will be delighted
to reply.

46:28.150 --> 46:34.150
- First of all, this machine
was installed in 2001...

46:35.183 --> 46:35.555
to replace a machine

46:35.742 --> 46:37.993
...that needed the intervention of...

46:37.994 --> 46:40.913
...an outside company for restocking

46:40.914 --> 46:44.625
...repairs etc.
It was very expensive

46:44.626 --> 46:46.435
And not at all profitable

46:46.754 --> 46:51.007
We switched to the new machine,
which isn’t profitable yet

46:51.008 --> 46:53.051
I’m sorry to hear that!

46:53.052 --> 46:55.214
And so we increased

46:55.472 --> 46:59.475
...the price of coffee by ten centimes.

46:59.476 --> 47:03.197
The thing has to be
economically viable

47:03.313 --> 47:08.211
- Nobody’s shocked?
- It’s clear and logical for me.

47:35.515 --> 47:38.392
- Good evening. Don’t move
- We have to go

47:38.393 --> 47:40.143
We haven’t finished

47:54.869 --> 47:57.621
" Respect

47:57.622 --> 48:01.208
" Adolescents
learn to respect their teachers...

48:01.209 --> 48:03.836
"..." because of threats...

48:03.837 --> 48:06.089
"..." or the fear of having problems

48:06.090 --> 48:08.591
" For starters, I respect you...

48:08.592 --> 48:11.678
"..." and respect must be mutual

48:11.679 --> 48:14.932
For instance,
I didn’t say you’re hysterical

48:14.933 --> 48:17.771
"..." so why do you say I am?

48:18.812 --> 48:21.272
" I’ve always respected you

48:21.273 --> 48:25.245
"..." so I don’t understand
why I have to write this.

48:26.111 --> 48:32.111
" I know you have it in for me
but don’t know why.

48:32.410 --> 48:34.953
" I shall sit at the back...

48:34.954 --> 48:38.720
"..." to avoid any other conflicts.

48:38.792 --> 48:41.263
" unless you come looking for them.

48:41.795 --> 48:43.838
" I admit I can be insolent...

48:43.839 --> 48:46.883
"..." but only if provoked.

48:46.884 --> 48:49.427
" I wont look at you again,.

48:49.428 --> 48:52.931
" so you cant say
my look is insolent.

48:52.932 --> 48:55.142
" In theory, in French class,

48:55.143 --> 48:58.562
"..." you talk about French,
not your grandma or sister

48:58.563 --> 49:01.034
"..." or girls periods.

49:01.525 --> 49:02.967
" And so, from now on,

49:02.985 --> 49:05.403
... " I wont spell to you again.."

49:05.404 --> 49:07.831
Signed Khoumba.

49:08.074 --> 49:09.866
- What is it?
- Secret.

49:09.867 --> 49:11.993
- A secret?
- A secret.

49:11.994 --> 49:14.878
It won’t stay a secret for long.

49:19.878 --> 49:22.505
Esmeralda,
Why have you changed places?

49:22.506 --> 49:23.849
No reason.

49:24.341 --> 49:25.989
I felt like it.

49:26.343 --> 49:29.859
- A problem?
- No, not at all.

49:30.264 --> 49:31.932
No problem.

49:31.933 --> 49:34.669
I wanted a change of scene.

49:41.568 --> 49:44.406
Ok, that’s enough.
Let’s get to work.

49:44.822 --> 49:46.527
No, sir, please!

49:47.283 --> 49:49.492
Please, sir!

49:49.493 --> 49:51.995
You’re just copying
what you did at home

49:51.996 --> 49:55.306
You’ve had plenty of time

49:56.459 --> 49:57.803
Esmeralda.

49:57.836 --> 50:01.146
I have to?

50:01.173 --> 50:03.540
Yes, absolutely.

50:06.220 --> 50:08.132
My name is Esmeralda Ouertani.

50:08.389 --> 50:09.556
I'm 14...

50:09.557 --> 50:12.350
...I live on Allee du Pere Dhuit...

50:12.351 --> 50:14.561
...Paris 20,

50:14.562 --> 50:17.856
...with my two parents and
my three brothers and sisters.

50:17.857 --> 50:18.941
Later,

50:18.942 --> 50:20.860
...I’d like to be a policewoman...

50:20.861 --> 50:24.739
...because people say
all policeman are bad,

50:24.740 --> 50:26.908
...and so we need good ones.

50:26.909 --> 50:29.828
If not, I’d like to be a rapper...

50:29.829 --> 50:33.594
...and I’m fan of Bakar, Medine,

50:33.666 --> 50:36.418
...Younes, Marvin and Mafiak1 Fry.

50:36.419 --> 50:37.544
Otherwise,

50:37.545 --> 50:41.882
I like eating, sleeping
and hanging out in the hood.

50:41.883 --> 50:43.227
Or rather?

50:43.427 --> 50:45.428
- The neighborhood.
- You can say it right.

50:45.429 --> 50:47.591
When you write,

50:47.640 --> 50:49.975
you use the standard style...

50:49.976 --> 50:53.645
Don’t make me correct you.

50:53.646 --> 50:55.234
Wey, go on.

50:57.817 --> 51:00.236
My names Wey, I’m Chinese.

51:00.237 --> 51:04.031
I’m 15, I have two sisters,
I’m the youngest.

51:04.032 --> 51:05.950
My hobby is playing video games

51:05.951 --> 51:08.584
at least 4 hours a day.

51:09.497 --> 51:12.207
I find it hard
using French correctly.

51:12.208 --> 51:15.043
It’s so hard expressing myself...

51:15.044 --> 51:18.005
...that others don’t understand me.

51:18.006 --> 51:21.153
That’s why I don’t communicate much.

51:21.969 --> 51:27.056
I hardly ever go out.
Nothing much interests me outside...

51:27.057 --> 51:31.603
The environment doesn’t suit me here
since I’m allergic

51:31.604 --> 51:33.722
...but i don’t know what.

51:33.856 --> 51:36.984
Allergic to yourself, that’s what.

51:36.985 --> 51:38.527
That’s good, Wey.

51:38.528 --> 51:41.405
I feel I know you better...

51:41.406 --> 51:44.552
...after hearing your self portrait.

51:44.702 --> 51:49.080
That’s the goal. To tell us things.

51:49.081 --> 51:51.625
He’s just happens to be good,
not ours

51:51.626 --> 51:53.669
No, not at all.

51:53.670 --> 51:55.712
I can congratulate Wey

51:55.713 --> 51:57.381
and I'd gladly congratulate you,

51:57.382 --> 52:01.052
if you manage to do it well.

52:01.053 --> 52:02.678
Rabah, read us...

52:02.679 --> 52:04.138
...your self portrait
- No.

52:04.139 --> 52:06.808
How can I congratulate you
if you don’t?

52:06.809 --> 52:08.152
I don’t need that.

52:08.185 --> 52:10.770
Make your mind up

52:10.771 --> 52:12.359
We’re listening.

52:12.940 --> 52:14.942
My name's Rabah. I’m 14.

52:14.943 --> 52:16.590
I listen to rap.

52:16.987 --> 52:20.823
I love my village in Kabylia
and go there every year.

52:20.824 --> 52:24.452
I like music, rap and slam.

52:24.453 --> 52:27.455
I have two brothers
but I don’t like school.

52:27.456 --> 52:29.416
I don’t like tramps.

52:29.417 --> 52:31.168
I like Zidane.

52:31.169 --> 52:34.254
I like to talk and I like
Psy 4 de la Rime's videos,

52:34.255 --> 52:35.741
...Go Marseille!

52:35.757 --> 52:38.217
We can manage without Marseille.

52:38.218 --> 52:39.343
Go Paris!

52:39.344 --> 52:42.263
We don’t need it in a self-portrait

52:42.264 --> 52:44.245
- That’s all.
- He skipped two lines.

52:44.308 --> 52:45.651
Cut it out.

52:48.104 --> 52:49.938
Go, dude.

52:49.939 --> 52:52.572
Boubacar!
- I like to make love

52:53.234 --> 52:56.323
I like to look good for the women

52:57.155 --> 52:58.739
and I like summer,

52:58.740 --> 53:00.653
...to see girls cleavage.

53:02.619 --> 53:04.996
Why not, Rabah?

53:04.997 --> 53:06.831
I never wrote that.

53:06.832 --> 53:08.875
It looks like your writing.

53:08.876 --> 53:10.220
No way!

53:12.547 --> 53:14.882
There’s no shame in liking cleavage.

53:14.883 --> 53:19.163
It's not a sin.

53:19.262 --> 53:23.057
Souleymane stop rocking
and read your self-portrait.

53:23.058 --> 53:25.476
- I’m very curious
- Huh?

53:25.477 --> 53:27.286
No, not huh.

53:27.730 --> 53:28.938
I wrote nothing.

53:28.939 --> 53:31.858
- I saw your writing earlier
- No, I wrote nothing

53:31.859 --> 53:33.110
You did

53:33.111 --> 53:35.538
- Nothing
- We're listening.

53:37.657 --> 53:40.284
I'm Souleymane.
I have nothing to say about me

53:40.285 --> 53:42.814
because no one knows me but me

53:44.873 --> 53:47.417
- Bravo!
- All right

53:47.418 --> 53:49.845
That’s good. A bit long maybe

53:53.841 --> 53:57.357
You can’t make the effort
that the others did?

53:57.929 --> 53:59.930
I don’t talk about myself.

53:59.931 --> 54:02.475
How come the others do?

54:02.476 --> 54:06.688
That’s their problem
I don’t talk about my life

54:06.689 --> 54:09.774
He just can’t write, that's all!

54:09.775 --> 54:11.371
What's up, you cop?

54:11.372 --> 54:13.153
You talking to me, cop?

54:13.154 --> 54:15.697
I can live with it

54:15.698 --> 54:18.033
- Enough!
- Arrest guys...

54:18.034 --> 54:20.578
...instead of talking to me.
Got your cuffs?

54:20.579 --> 54:22.741
Your breath stinks!

54:23.749 --> 54:26.000
- Chill.
- Heard of Aquafresh?

54:26.001 --> 54:27.443
Souleymane...

54:27.461 --> 54:29.546
there's no need
to be offensive.

54:29.547 --> 54:31.465
Need a toothbrush?

54:31.466 --> 54:32.674
Souleymane,

54:32.675 --> 54:38.055
...You’re a lot better
at oral insults than writing

54:38.056 --> 54:40.683
He can’t even write his name.

54:40.684 --> 54:43.227
Zip it! What does this say?

54:43.228 --> 54:44.937
Spare us your Koran.

54:44.938 --> 54:49.025
Shut it. What’s wrong
with the Koran.

54:49.026 --> 54:50.261
I’ll spare you when you calm dawn

54:50.278 --> 54:50.998
It’s the Koran.

54:51.154 --> 54:52.079
Bullshit!

54:52.196 --> 54:55.949
What’s that tattoo, Souleymane?

54:55.950 --> 54:57.576
Why are you showing it?

54:57.577 --> 55:00.254
He claims it's Koran

55:01.289 --> 55:03.958
What is it? Why are you showing us?

55:03.959 --> 55:07.378
It means shut your mouth.

55:07.379 --> 55:09.255
It doesn’t mean that

55:09.256 --> 55:12.634
So give us the real translation
Go on, tell us

55:12.635 --> 55:14.219
I don’t want to

55:14.220 --> 55:18.295
You show it in my class so tell us.

55:19.601 --> 55:22.186
It says here, right here:

55:22.187 --> 55:26.608
"If your words are less important
than silence, keep quiet."

55:26.609 --> 55:29.285
What I said

55:32.240 --> 55:34.199
It’s not what you said.

55:34.200 --> 55:36.201
Why isn’t it the same?

55:36.202 --> 55:38.537
It’s different.
I think it sounds better

55:38.538 --> 55:41.171
Yes it’s better put.

55:42.292 --> 55:45.753
If only you could write such
interesting things on paper,

55:45.754 --> 55:47.338
that would be great

55:47.339 --> 55:48.840
I think so too.

55:48.841 --> 55:51.063
That proves you can do it.

55:53.137 --> 55:55.764
After these fires few
self-portraits, Id like you,

55:55.765 --> 55:58.601
to rewrite them and polish them...

55:58.602 --> 56:02.813
...making sure you answer
the questions that we listed:

56:02.814 --> 56:05.342
what I like and don’t like...

56:05.484 --> 56:08.529
my qualities and flaws
who I’d like to be?

56:09.322 --> 56:10.909
Come in.

56:13.576 --> 56:16.620
Stand up please. Good morning.

56:16.621 --> 56:18.956
That goes for those at the back too

56:18.957 --> 56:22.884
Come on, stand up.

56:23.295 --> 56:26.464
Cherif, you heard me?
Everyone has to stand.

56:26.465 --> 56:30.385
It’s a way of greeting an adult

56:30.386 --> 56:33.263
It doesn’t mean
submission or humiliation.

56:33.264 --> 56:35.177
Good. Sit back down

56:36.768 --> 56:40.563
I’ve come to introduce
a new student.

56:40.564 --> 56:41.731
Carl.

56:41.732 --> 56:44.984
Try to make him welcome...

56:44.985 --> 56:47.821
...until the end of the year.

56:47.822 --> 56:51.485
Thank you

56:52.118 --> 56:55.162
Carl, go sit in the third row,
in that free place

56:55.163 --> 56:59.193
Khoumba, move your things

57:02.254 --> 57:04.881
Take a sheet of paper and a pen

57:04.882 --> 57:07.759
and try to catch up with the others

57:07.760 --> 57:09.246
...We’ll talk after

57:12.598 --> 57:16.852
Don’t forget the homework
for Monday without fail.

57:16.853 --> 57:19.530
Let’s finish with this

57:20.482 --> 57:24.300
Carl, stay here a minute or two

57:32.870 --> 57:34.214
Welcome

57:34.372 --> 57:36.999
I don’t know if you know

57:37.000 --> 57:40.920
but I'm Mr. Marin,
your class supervisor.

57:40.921 --> 57:44.275
If there’s a problem, tell me.

57:45.259 --> 57:48.720
I know who you are...
why you’re here

57:48.721 --> 57:50.138
The principal told me

57:50.139 --> 57:52.724
but that doesn’t matter for me

57:52.725 --> 57:55.686
We'll start from scratch here

57:55.687 --> 57:58.672
It will all go well.

57:58.899 --> 58:01.859
You’ve seen that we...

58:01.860 --> 58:04.570
Were on self-portraits to be
handed in next Monday.

58:04.571 --> 58:07.866
- Maybe you could do one too
- OK.

58:07.867 --> 58:09.881
Know when the next class is?

58:12.330 --> 58:14.164
Monday, 9.30

58:14.165 --> 58:15.974
Good.

58:17.544 --> 58:20.118
You like French?

58:21.131 --> 58:23.190
Like everyone, I guess.

58:26.554 --> 58:28.888
That doesn’t mean much.

58:28.889 --> 58:30.846
Ok, off you go.

58:31.851 --> 58:33.866
Good bye

58:34.437 --> 58:36.563
You know what a self-portrait is?

58:36.564 --> 58:38.232
- Yes.
- You’re sure?

58:38.233 --> 58:39.880
Yes.

58:40.318 --> 58:42.024
Have a good day.

58:53.416 --> 58:57.086
Pleased to meet you

58:57.087 --> 58:58.940
Sit down, please.

59:00.132 --> 59:02.800
Thank you for coming

59:02.801 --> 59:04.714
I know it isn’t easy

59:05.804 --> 59:08.598
We're very pleased with Wey

59:08.599 --> 59:13.228
Very pleased. All the teachers
at the staff meeting said so.

59:13.229 --> 59:15.898
He's kind, he's pleasant...

59:15.899 --> 59:18.692
It's good to have him in class.

59:18.693 --> 59:20.811
And it’s showing in his grades.

59:21.196 --> 59:23.406
we have...

59:23.407 --> 59:27.118
the usual good grades in mathematics.
He's doing well there

59:27.119 --> 59:29.134
13/20.

59:29.538 --> 59:31.623
In French,
we have a 9 here

59:31.624 --> 59:34.153
Not a lot

59:34.919 --> 59:39.381
He doesn’t speak French very well
yet but that’s only normal

59:39.382 --> 59:42.428
He speaks a lot.
He tells me about a lot of things.

59:43.178 --> 59:45.680
He talks about his computer

59:45.681 --> 59:46.651
He’s into that

59:46.724 --> 59:48.600
Always too late

59:48.601 --> 59:50.393
He works too late?

59:50.394 --> 59:52.354
Yes, too late, not sleep good.

59:52.355 --> 59:54.929
After, school not good.

59:55.859 --> 59:58.696
...Eyes get sick after

1:00:00.322 --> 1:00:03.324
He may spend a lot of time
on the computer

1:00:03.325 --> 1:00:05.547
but things are fine at school
for now

1:00:05.869 --> 1:00:10.106
He works well
and he doesn’t seem tired

1:00:12.168 --> 1:00:16.630
Nassim... I’d like him to do...

1:00:16.631 --> 1:00:19.160
He can go far. He has all he needs

1:00:21.261 --> 1:00:24.408
At his age, I wasn’t that lucky

1:00:24.848 --> 1:00:26.192
I’m behind him

1:00:26.600 --> 1:00:29.477
Anything he needs, I get him

1:00:29.478 --> 1:00:31.596
But he has to do right

1:00:32.023 --> 1:00:34.900
Things are good at home with him

1:00:34.901 --> 1:00:37.861
but I’d like him
to keep on studying

1:00:37.862 --> 1:00:40.322
Me and his mother,

1:00:40.323 --> 1:00:42.158
we’d like to be proud of him

1:00:42.159 --> 1:00:44.012
That’s what we ask of him

1:00:44.203 --> 1:00:48.381
I think we all agree
on what we need to do.

1:00:50.126 --> 1:00:52.169
It’s crazy how alike you are

1:00:52.170 --> 1:00:54.296
We're lookers in family

1:00:54.297 --> 1:00:56.415
You’re right.

1:00:56.549 --> 1:01:00.970
An adolescent who talks
with his family,

1:01:00.971 --> 1:01:04.348
...who has good grades,

1:01:04.349 --> 1:01:06.351
...who has friends,

1:01:06.352 --> 1:01:09.521
even if he’s a bit of a loner,

1:01:09.522 --> 1:01:12.023
...he’s an outcast?

1:01:12.024 --> 1:01:15.861
He’s a boy who talks with adults,
who exchanges with them

1:01:15.862 --> 1:01:17.404
Maybe he doesn’t with you

1:01:17.405 --> 1:01:20.574
but that means

1:01:20.575 --> 1:01:25.474
...he’s just a teenager
trying to define himself.

1:01:25.497 --> 1:01:28.708
I was useless at school for years,

1:01:28.709 --> 1:01:32.838
...I rejected the idea
of marking us fit in with the system.

1:01:32.839 --> 1:01:35.001
Do his black clothes bother you?

1:01:35.091 --> 1:01:37.768
The way he looks?

1:01:38.470 --> 1:01:40.117
I don’t get it.

1:01:41.431 --> 1:01:45.300
I’d like him to go to the best,

1:01:46.103 --> 1:01:47.956
to Henri IV.

1:01:48.189 --> 1:01:50.042
Why?

1:01:50.358 --> 1:01:52.609
Standards again...

1:01:52.610 --> 1:01:55.487
Because they have
very high standards.

1:01:55.488 --> 1:01:59.408
A mother wants the best for her son

1:01:59.409 --> 1:02:02.662
She’s scared I’ll feel lost
in high school because of others

1:02:02.663 --> 1:02:06.875
...went to fancy private schools.

1:02:06.876 --> 1:02:09.817
and Dolto Hogh isn’t like that

1:02:10.338 --> 1:02:14.591
It’s a pity that the teachers...

1:02:14.592 --> 1:02:17.121
I don't want to accuse anyone

1:02:17.304 --> 1:02:20.349
Go on, accuse us. It’s a pleasure

1:02:21.558 --> 1:02:23.926
Why don’t you try

1:02:24.144 --> 1:02:27.063
...to push the better students

1:02:27.064 --> 1:02:29.816
...a little harder, say?

1:02:29.817 --> 1:02:33.612
They get bogged down
by other students...

1:02:33.613 --> 1:02:36.156
...who aren’t as good

1:02:36.157 --> 1:02:39.570
My mom makes stuff up.
Dolto High isn’t useless.

1:02:40.954 --> 1:02:43.792
- I didn’t say useless,
I said average

1:02:44.166 --> 1:02:46.490
I didn’t call it useless

1:02:48.838 --> 1:02:53.216
- We talked about Souleymane
a great deal...

1:02:53.217 --> 1:02:55.130
...at the staff meeting

1:02:55.595 --> 1:02:58.138
Many teachers have complained
about his attitude

1:02:58.139 --> 1:03:02.101
...that is very negative.

1:03:02.102 --> 1:03:03.686
What?

1:03:03.687 --> 1:03:05.813
Many complain...

1:03:05.814 --> 1:03:09.818
...that he comes without his things,

1:03:09.819 --> 1:03:12.195
...When he comes, as he’s often absent

1:03:12.196 --> 1:03:16.169
- I think you know that
- No we didn’t know

1:03:16.201 --> 1:03:19.246
Souleymane tells us he works hard

1:03:36.931 --> 1:03:38.946
She doesn’t think so.

1:03:39.351 --> 1:03:43.146
- There have been notes
in his report book...

1:03:43.147 --> 1:03:44.956
...since September, 3 month now

1:03:46.275 --> 1:03:49.861
Notes about the problems
he was having.

1:03:49.862 --> 1:03:53.996
- She signs them without knowing
because she cant read.

1:03:55.368 --> 1:03:57.281
You read the notes too?

1:03:57.454 --> 1:04:00.664
Yes, but I'm just his brother. You see?

1:04:00.665 --> 1:04:03.960
But you knew there was a problem?

1:04:03.961 --> 1:04:07.933
- No, I didn’t know.
He says things are fine when I ask

1:04:08.048 --> 1:04:09.857
Does he work at home?

1:04:10.134 --> 1:04:11.722
He stays in his room

1:04:25.943 --> 1:04:28.486
She doesn’t understand the notes

1:04:28.487 --> 1:04:29.929
I realize that

1:04:30.156 --> 1:04:32.574
You know the situation now

1:04:32.575 --> 1:04:35.953
I'm telling you officially:
there's a problem

1:04:35.954 --> 1:04:40.028
- Talk to him.
- I'll talk to him about it

1:04:43.712 --> 1:04:46.698
Just having an idea.

1:04:46.757 --> 1:04:48.842
Maybe conversation with his father

1:04:48.843 --> 1:04:51.470
could help.

1:04:51.471 --> 1:04:56.183
I'll talk to my father
and see what we can do

1:04:56.184 --> 1:04:58.964
We're not settling scores.

1:04:58.979 --> 1:05:00.891
We want to improve things

1:05:18.083 --> 1:05:19.568
- Your mom?
- You bet.

1:05:23.255 --> 1:05:26.197
- Ugly old crow!
- She hates photos

1:05:27.718 --> 1:05:30.846
Me and my bro pissed her off

1:05:30.847 --> 1:05:33.682
Sir! Souleymane has a photos

1:05:33.683 --> 1:05:35.017
...for his self-portrait

1:05:35.018 --> 1:05:37.144
Cut it out, my photos are crap.

1:05:37.145 --> 1:05:39.263
- That’s a good idea.
- Get your down

1:05:40.232 --> 1:05:42.775
Painters do self-portraits

1:05:42.776 --> 1:05:45.653
- I'm no painter
- Yes, I know that.

1:05:45.654 --> 1:05:47.197
Let's go

1:05:47.198 --> 1:05:48.639
Caps, please

1:05:58.142 --> 1:06:01.978
I spend all my free time
playing the guitar.

1:06:01.979 --> 1:06:04.523
If you’re typing, hurry and finish
to let the others...

1:06:04.524 --> 1:06:10.363
...type up their self-portraits

1:06:12.073 --> 1:06:13.945
Souleymane,
Dont blow the place up!

1:06:15.452 --> 1:06:17.954
- You know what you’re doing?
- Yeah

1:06:17.955 --> 1:06:21.291
As a computer genius
you’ll put it all back after.

1:06:21.292 --> 1:06:23.210
Don’t worry.

1:06:23.211 --> 1:06:25.373
I’m counting on you.

1:06:30.218 --> 1:06:33.471
- Ok, Carl?
- Yes, sir

1:06:33.472 --> 1:06:36.057
- I can’t see it?
- No, not yet.

1:06:36.058 --> 1:06:37.705
Sir?

1:06:38.852 --> 1:06:41.271
How do you spell Lafayette?

1:06:41.272 --> 1:06:44.900
- How do you mean?
- Like Galeries Lafayette.

1:06:44.901 --> 1:06:46.568
Why mention that?

1:06:46.569 --> 1:06:49.717
I go there often
so I want to add it

1:06:49.781 --> 1:06:54.702
Wow! That’s four metro stops
A huge leap from your neighborhood

1:06:54.703 --> 1:06:57.372
We're not Hicks

1:06:57.373 --> 1:06:58.716
We're city kids

1:06:58.791 --> 1:07:02.711
Really? You go into
the center of Paris?

1:07:02.712 --> 1:07:05.422
I go everywhere. The 1st, the 5th,

1:07:05.423 --> 1:07:07.481
the 20th, the 12th, the 19th

1:07:07.717 --> 1:07:09.426
Why do you go to the 5th?

1:07:09.427 --> 1:07:11.178
In the 5th, I go to see pals

1:07:11.179 --> 1:07:13.973
...in high school

1:07:13.974 --> 1:07:15.518
Near Luxembourg.

1:07:15.684 --> 1:07:17.518
The Luxembourg gardens?

1:07:17.519 --> 1:07:20.094
Not the gardens, Luxembourg.

1:07:20.272 --> 1:07:21.856
The country?

1:07:21.857 --> 1:07:27.182
No, the Luxembourg metro station!

1:07:27.614 --> 1:07:29.099
So you do get out and about

1:07:30.992 --> 1:07:33.077
I see you two have made up

1:07:33.078 --> 1:07:36.581
- It's our business
- And not yours

1:07:36.582 --> 1:07:38.625
So, how do you spell Lafayette?

1:07:38.626 --> 1:07:44.256
Lafayette is L-A-F-A-Y-E-T-T-E.

1:07:44.257 --> 1:07:46.271
With a capital

1:07:48.678 --> 1:07:50.022
Much better now!

1:07:50.555 --> 1:07:52.389
Much better

1:07:52.390 --> 1:07:54.976
Yes, that is a good photo

1:07:54.977 --> 1:07:57.757
- You could add a legend.
- A legend?

1:07:57.813 --> 1:07:59.725
Like a story or tale.

1:08:00.775 --> 1:08:03.777
A caption under the photo
like in papers.

1:08:03.778 --> 1:08:06.446
You mean, like in Le Parisien?

1:08:06.447 --> 1:08:08.574
Yes, like in Le Parisien

1:08:08.575 --> 1:08:11.035
What could you put? Who is she?

1:08:11.036 --> 1:08:13.037
- My old woman.
- Meaning?

1:08:13.038 --> 1:08:16.290
- My mother
- You could say she's your mother.

1:08:16.291 --> 1:08:19.252
Then you could explain

1:08:19.253 --> 1:08:21.921
...why she's making this gesture
to the photographer

1:08:21.922 --> 1:08:24.758
They'd pissed her off

1:08:24.759 --> 1:08:26.093
I'm not gonna write that!

1:08:26.094 --> 1:08:29.471
- So why is she doing that?
- She hates photos

1:08:29.472 --> 1:08:32.349
So write that
"My mother hate having

1:08:32.350 --> 1:08:33.733
... "her photo taken".

1:08:35.187 --> 1:08:38.438
That's a legend.

1:08:38.524 --> 1:08:40.010
- Understand?
- Yeah

1:08:40.317 --> 1:08:44.760
Do that with all the photos
and you're set

1:09:07.388 --> 1:09:10.580
- Printed everything?
- Yeah, I’m good

1:09:13.520 --> 1:09:15.638
Excellent

1:09:17.775 --> 1:09:19.692
What are you doing now, sir?

1:09:19.693 --> 1:09:23.947
As you can see,
I’m putting the photos up

1:09:23.948 --> 1:09:25.595
...to get a global view

1:09:28.036 --> 1:09:31.492
The others read out,
their self-portraits

1:09:31.790 --> 1:09:34.423
...so you’re going to put yours...

1:09:34.459 --> 1:09:35.877
...on show.

1:09:35.878 --> 1:09:37.879
You know my photos suck

1:09:37.880 --> 1:09:40.757
Not at all, they’re very good

1:09:40.758 --> 1:09:42.008
Sure

1:09:42.009 --> 1:09:44.720
When a student does good work,

1:09:44.721 --> 1:09:47.097
...I let the whole class see it

1:09:47.098 --> 1:09:49.224
You’re just winding me up

1:09:49.225 --> 1:09:51.852
No, I wind you up if I feel

1:09:51.853 --> 1:09:54.280
...you can do better. This is good.

1:09:55.941 --> 1:09:57.567
That's bullshit

1:09:57.568 --> 1:10:01.613
If you've finished,
come and take a look

1:10:01.614 --> 1:10:04.199
...at Souleymane's masterpiece

1:10:04.200 --> 1:10:05.847
Slowly

1:10:09.497 --> 1:10:11.247
I'll straighten them

1:10:11.291 --> 1:10:15.263
Look at the tattoo!
You're hideous!

1:10:48.331 --> 1:10:50.791
I like playing soccer

1:10:50.792 --> 1:10:53.252
I like playing computer games

1:10:53.253 --> 1:10:55.797
I like playing with pretty girls

1:10:55.798 --> 1:10:58.549
I like vacations in the Carribean

1:10:58.550 --> 1:11:02.470
I like fries, zouk and dancehall music

1:11:02.471 --> 1:11:05.849
I like watching MTV Base

1:11:05.850 --> 1:11:08.393
and I like my parents and my brother.

1:11:08.394 --> 1:11:11.897
I like my pals and staying up all night

1:11:11.898 --> 1:11:14.901
I like the series on the slave trade

1:11:14.902 --> 1:11:20.281
I like my hood
I like the series Homeland Security

1:11:20.282 --> 1:11:24.931
I like eating in restaurants
and going wild.

1:11:25.413 --> 1:11:27.873
I hate people crying for no reason

1:11:27.874 --> 1:11:30.584
I hate techno and tectonic

1:11:30.585 --> 1:11:33.629
I hate guys and girls who show off

1:11:33.630 --> 1:11:36.883
I hate visiting my brother in jail

1:11:36.884 --> 1:11:39.886
I hate talent contest shows on TV

1:11:39.887 --> 1:11:44.599
I hate politicians,
the war in Iraq,

1:11:44.600 --> 1:11:46.977
Goths and skaters

1:11:46.978 --> 1:11:50.105
I hate teachers who are too strict

1:11:50.106 --> 1:11:52.942
I hate mathematics, racists

1:11:52.943 --> 1:11:55.027
and I hate Materazzi

1:11:55.028 --> 1:12:00.604
I hates the Paul Eluard school
and I like being here

1:12:05.206 --> 1:12:08.927
I have something to say

1:12:09.336 --> 1:12:11.910
Could you listen to me, please?

1:12:11.922 --> 1:12:15.675
I have something to say
The mother of Wey

1:12:15.676 --> 1:12:18.678
...a student in 4/3
has been arrested

1:12:18.679 --> 1:12:21.139
She was in France illegally.

1:12:21.140 --> 1:12:23.058
She has been picked up

1:12:23.059 --> 1:12:26.061
and may be tried next week

1:12:26.062 --> 1:12:29.440
She may be deported to China.
I thought you should know

1:12:29.441 --> 1:12:30.774
as its important

1:12:30.775 --> 1:12:33.865
She's been here 3 years now!

1:12:35.405 --> 1:12:39.284
I know but that's how it goes,

1:12:39.285 --> 1:12:40.994
wrong place, wrong time

1:12:40.995 --> 1:12:42.829
Not the father?

1:12:42.830 --> 1:12:44.331
He doesn’t have papers either

1:12:44.332 --> 1:12:47.377
but they don’t bother him

1:12:48.378 --> 1:12:50.921
To start with

1:12:50.922 --> 1:12:53.758
as lawyers cost a lot

1:12:53.759 --> 1:12:56.969
we could do a collection

1:12:56.970 --> 1:13:00.056
and maybe even go to court

1:13:00.057 --> 1:13:03.894
to try have some influence
on the verdict

1:13:03.895 --> 1:13:05.851
Will Wey have to leave?

1:13:06.522 --> 1:13:10.391
Not for now but you never know.

1:13:14.323 --> 1:13:15.764
Well,

1:13:15.908 --> 1:13:18.335
I feel kind of pathetic after that

1:13:19.370 --> 1:13:22.080
I had something to tell you,

1:13:22.081 --> 1:13:24.249
...but this isn’t a good time

1:13:24.250 --> 1:13:26.883
You’ve said too much now

1:13:30.257 --> 1:13:32.213
I'm pregnant

1:13:35.179 --> 1:13:37.855
That calls for a celebration!

1:13:41.394 --> 1:13:43.311
How far gone?

1:13:43.312 --> 1:13:48.108
Two months. I'll only have a drop

1:13:51.947 --> 1:13:53.948
Just a drop

1:13:53.949 --> 1:13:56.625
Bravo, Vincent!
I didn’t do it on purpose!

1:13:56.869 --> 1:14:00.163
Who shook it?

1:14:00.164 --> 1:14:01.539
Any names yet? If it’s a boy, say?

1:14:01.540 --> 1:14:03.917
...You already know?

1:14:03.918 --> 1:14:07.007
If it’s a boy, I like Enguerran.

1:14:07.755 --> 1:14:09.381
Seriously?

1:14:09.382 --> 1:14:12.802
What a handicap!
That won't be easy

1:14:12.803 --> 1:14:16.775
I hope not. Thanks a lot!

1:14:19.393 --> 1:14:21.353
You all have a glass?

1:14:21.354 --> 1:14:24.192
Hold on a second

1:14:25.984 --> 1:14:28.867
I have two wishes

1:14:29.154 --> 1:14:31.489
I have two wishes

1:14:31.490 --> 1:14:34.033
My first wish

1:14:34.034 --> 1:14:38.212
is that Wey's mom stays in France

1:14:39.331 --> 1:14:42.375
And my second wish

1:14:42.376 --> 1:14:45.833
...is that my child will be
as intelligent as Wey

1:14:58.936 --> 1:15:00.480
"Jackie Chan"!

1:15:01.480 --> 1:15:02.824
C'mon, play

1:15:10.615 --> 1:15:13.499
I didn’t do nothing

1:15:14.286 --> 1:15:16.653
He just fell!

1:15:34.474 --> 1:15:36.842
Play, Souleymane

1:15:40.272 --> 1:15:44.401
- What do you say, Mali man?
- What’s up, you Caribbean shit?

1:15:44.402 --> 1:15:47.696
Malian bastard!

1:15:47.697 --> 1:15:49.041
Motherfucker

1:15:49.199 --> 1:15:50.824
C’mon lets play!

1:15:50.825 --> 1:15:53.744
- Caribbean fag!
- I’ll waste the fucker

1:15:53.745 --> 1:15:55.089
Shut up

1:15:58.083 --> 1:16:00.040
Blow Thierry Henri, faggot

1:16:03.923 --> 1:16:06.300
Stand there. Talk loud enough

1:16:06.301 --> 1:16:09.303
for them to hear
and try to convince them.

1:16:09.304 --> 1:16:10.971
Go ahead

1:16:10.972 --> 1:16:15.561
The African Cup of Nations
will be starting soon

1:16:16.103 --> 1:16:18.605
I'm glad Morocco's playing

1:16:18.606 --> 1:16:21.149
It's the best team in the world
in my opinion.

1:16:21.150 --> 1:16:22.359
The sick thing is

1:16:22.360 --> 1:16:25.445
that my pals,
the Malians aren't playing.

1:16:25.446 --> 1:16:27.196
It's tough for them.

1:16:27.490 --> 1:16:31.160
They weren't good enough to qualify.

1:16:31.161 --> 1:16:35.873
Morocco would have let them play
on a friendly basis...

1:16:35.874 --> 1:16:39.699
but 4-0 is really hurts

1:16:40.755 --> 1:16:43.298
- 4-0 how?
- Last time

1:16:43.299 --> 1:16:47.373
...Mali played Morocco,
they wasted 4-0

1:16:47.971 --> 1:16:50.029
But the weird thing is

1:16:50.682 --> 1:16:53.809
...when Mali doesn't play

1:16:53.810 --> 1:16:56.813
...it's like all the Africans here,

1:16:56.814 --> 1:16:58.690
...aren't African

1:16:58.691 --> 1:17:01.609
With each cup, they all go crazy

1:17:01.610 --> 1:17:06.114
but when Mali doesn’t play,
they keep a low profile.

1:17:06.115 --> 1:17:08.028
Weird.

1:17:08.243 --> 1:17:11.245
So, whether Mali plays in the
African Cup of Nations or not,

1:17:11.246 --> 1:17:15.011
...the Africans in this class
feel more or less African. Ok.

1:17:17.544 --> 1:17:19.766
Thank you, Nassim.

1:17:20.548 --> 1:17:23.633
I get the feeling
your words are directed

1:17:23.634 --> 1:17:25.427
...at your neighbor, Souleymane

1:17:25.428 --> 1:17:26.887
Morocco jerk's

1:17:26.888 --> 1:17:28.432
...not even on my radar,

1:17:30.058 --> 1:17:32.485
Arthur is next

1:17:35.939 --> 1:17:39.317
I see you have your notes
just like a politician

1:17:39.318 --> 1:17:41.277
- Exactly
- That's good

1:17:41.278 --> 1:17:44.614
Speak up Arthur.
Esmeralda, let him speak first

1:17:44.615 --> 1:17:46.408
I want to defend my look

1:17:46.409 --> 1:17:51.363
...A lot of people say it sucks

1:17:51.748 --> 1:17:57.176
I don’t dish your clothes,
so you don’t dish mine.

1:17:58.130 --> 1:18:00.454
Clothes are freedom of speech

1:18:00.966 --> 1:18:05.137
I dress how I want
you dress how you want, ok

1:18:05.138 --> 1:18:07.723
I dress like this to be different

1:18:07.724 --> 1:18:10.893
...and not follow the others
like sheep.

1:18:10.894 --> 1:18:13.771
You're the sheep here!

1:18:13.772 --> 1:18:17.567
I feel better being myself

1:18:17.568 --> 1:18:19.421
and not being like others

1:18:21.739 --> 1:18:25.450
I also think
if there were 22 goths here,

1:18:25.451 --> 1:18:28.494
...and one guy like you
you'd keep quiet then

1:18:29.998 --> 1:18:33.167
There's a contradiction
in what you say

1:18:33.168 --> 1:18:36.003
You want to be you.
Are those clothes you?

1:18:36.004 --> 1:18:40.258
Those clothes are worn
by a huge number of people

1:18:40.259 --> 1:18:43.595
Most people who wear them
are gloomy inside

1:18:43.596 --> 1:18:46.473
...so we're all kind of alike

1:18:46.474 --> 1:18:50.936
- You're all alike, you're all gloomy,
so that’s not you.

1:18:50.937 --> 1:18:53.564
By being different

1:18:53.565 --> 1:18:55.933
You're different and the same.

1:18:56.276 --> 1:18:58.528
Thank you for taking a stand

1:18:58.529 --> 1:19:01.839
...and being brave enough to do so

1:19:01.866 --> 1:19:03.658
Boubacar, go on

1:19:03.659 --> 1:19:06.292
Boubacar, my pal

1:19:06.537 --> 1:19:08.450
Listen to him

1:19:10.917 --> 1:19:12.667
I’ve come up to reply to Nassim

1:19:13.879 --> 1:19:16.339
He says that since Mali

1:19:16.340 --> 1:19:21.553
isn’t in the Africa Cup of Nations
black Africans have no team to support

1:19:21.554 --> 1:19:23.972
But he's forgetting Ivory Coast!

1:19:23.973 --> 1:19:26.915
With an ace player Didier Drogba

1:19:27.185 --> 1:19:31.480
He beats any Moroccan

1:19:31.481 --> 1:19:34.692
He plays for Chelsea
What Moroccan plays in England?

1:19:34.693 --> 1:19:36.036
They're not up to it

1:19:36.487 --> 1:19:39.155
I'm through.

1:19:39.156 --> 1:19:40.500
Thanks, Boubacar

1:19:40.866 --> 1:19:43.852
I think that rectification
was indeed...

1:19:44.412 --> 1:19:46.426
...indispensable

1:19:48.208 --> 1:19:50.429
Who wants to speak now?

1:19:50.543 --> 1:19:52.293
Carl, go on

1:19:58.928 --> 1:20:00.887
Actually, I'd like to say

1:20:00.888 --> 1:20:03.181
they're starting to piss us off...

1:20:03.182 --> 1:20:05.767
...with the Africa Cup

1:20:05.768 --> 1:20:09.146
At recess you're there
pissing us off with your cup

1:20:09.147 --> 1:20:11.565
It hasn't even started yet...

1:20:11.566 --> 1:20:14.360
Carl, I'll be polite with you

1:20:14.361 --> 1:20:18.406
Sorry to interrupt, but tell me,
what's your national team?

1:20:18.407 --> 1:20:19.750
France

1:20:20.910 --> 1:20:23.578
Why do you say you're Caribbean...

1:20:23.579 --> 1:20:25.205
...rather than French?

1:20:25.206 --> 1:20:28.766
We're French. It's a French region

1:20:29.461 --> 1:20:31.796
Why don't you ever say
you're French?

1:20:31.797 --> 1:20:33.965
- It's the same
- I don't think so

1:20:33.966 --> 1:20:37.093
Look at the players.
Thierry Henri, Wiltord...

1:20:37.094 --> 1:20:39.256
...Abidal, Thuram...

1:20:39.263 --> 1:20:41.473
Where does Diarra play?

1:20:41.474 --> 1:20:44.935
He won't play in Mali, bro,
he's not crazy enough.

1:20:44.936 --> 1:20:48.522
Shut your mouth, pal,
I'm not your bro!

1:20:48.523 --> 1:20:50.994
An ape like this jerk

1:20:52.235 --> 1:20:54.662
No need to loose your cool.

1:20:56.907 --> 1:20:59.378
We can talk calmly!

1:21:00.995 --> 1:21:04.414
That isn’t a slanging match.
It’s a debate.

1:21:04.415 --> 1:21:07.376
Souleymane,
watch your language

1:21:07.377 --> 1:21:08.710
He's fuming!

1:21:08.711 --> 1:21:11.338
Clam up. Go get fucked!

1:21:11.339 --> 1:21:13.549
No vulgarity

1:21:13.550 --> 1:21:16.434
- I ain’t talking to you, man
- I’m talking to you

1:21:16.470 --> 1:21:18.999
Is that any way
to talk to a teacher?

1:21:21.475 --> 1:21:25.479
That's enough now
You're coming with me

1:21:25.480 --> 1:21:29.305
- I'm talking to you
- Don't start yelling at me, ok

1:21:31.319 --> 1:21:33.279
I'll get you, faggot

1:21:33.280 --> 1:21:35.647
You just can’t talk normally?

1:21:35.741 --> 1:21:37.575
Shut up, ape

1:21:37.576 --> 1:21:39.164
Nobody else moves

1:21:56.054 --> 1:21:58.011
Hurry it up

1:22:01.060 --> 1:22:03.943
- Move it
- Hands off!

1:22:17.911 --> 1:22:21.103
Aren’t you sick
of assing around?

1:22:30.675 --> 1:22:32.117
Sorry to bother you

1:22:32.135 --> 1:22:37.564
I have a troublemaker who's
been disrespectful in class.

1:22:40.436 --> 1:22:44.201
I didn’t ask you to sit down,
Souleymane.

1:22:48.820 --> 1:22:52.071
My class is waiting

1:23:01.417 --> 1:23:03.226
Sit down now.

1:23:09.551 --> 1:23:11.669
I'm listening

1:23:15.849 --> 1:23:18.688
Will you tell me what happened?

1:23:19.103 --> 1:23:24.369
A teacher should have to leave
his class to bring you here?

1:23:31.658 --> 1:23:33.880
"Results

1:23:34.036 --> 1:23:36.154
..."too uneven

1:23:36.622 --> 1:23:39.049
"Too much talking in class"

1:23:44.213 --> 1:23:46.924
Now let's move on to Louise,

1:23:46.925 --> 1:23:48.837
present here today

1:23:50.053 --> 1:23:52.480
A total disaster.
What can we do with you?

1:23:52.848 --> 1:23:54.056
No, good work

1:23:54.057 --> 1:23:55.975
Always good, I'd say

1:23:55.976 --> 1:24:01.134
It's a joy having a student
like her. We need to say it.

1:24:01.399 --> 1:24:05.736
Shall we offer this young lady
a commendation?

1:24:05.737 --> 1:24:07.029
I'm sorry, but I don't

1:24:07.030 --> 1:24:09.239
...totally agree with you.

1:24:09.240 --> 1:24:12.535
She's relatively well-placed
in the class

1:24:12.536 --> 1:24:15.005
from a numerical angle

1:24:15.497 --> 1:24:18.166
But a commendation?
There's room for progress,

1:24:18.167 --> 1:24:21.127
huge room for progress

1:24:21.128 --> 1:24:24.089
and I don’t think
her general attitude

1:24:24.090 --> 1:24:26.550
...really merits a commendation

1:24:26.551 --> 1:24:27.759
That's the problem

1:24:27.760 --> 1:24:29.845
with commendations

1:24:29.846 --> 1:24:33.808
...Are they purely numerical
and mathematical

1:24:33.809 --> 1:24:35.309
or are they also to do

1:24:35.310 --> 1:24:39.341
...with her attitude and behavior
as top of the class?

1:24:39.356 --> 1:24:42.317
That means, to get commendation,

1:24:42.318 --> 1:24:45.529
...you have to be an excellent student

1:24:45.530 --> 1:24:49.046
...and, at the same time,
be a class leader?

1:24:53.038 --> 1:24:55.665
So a commendation this term

1:24:55.666 --> 1:24:59.544
Louise is intelligent

1:24:59.545 --> 1:25:02.352
...and will realize she can do better
to satisfy you

1:25:07.512 --> 1:25:10.498
Now, Cherif

1:25:10.515 --> 1:25:12.266
...Our friend Cherif

1:25:12.267 --> 1:25:15.228
I have a problem with Cherif

1:25:15.229 --> 1:25:17.438
...He's a kid with abilities
he could do well

1:25:17.439 --> 1:25:20.150
could easily give him 17/20

1:25:20.151 --> 1:25:22.569
...but he spends so much time talking

1:25:22.570 --> 1:25:25.864
...and disturbing the class,

1:25:25.865 --> 1:25:28.325
...his average grade is poor
And that's a pity

1:25:28.326 --> 1:25:30.870
His behavior's irregular.
He can be a disaster

1:25:30.871 --> 1:25:35.208
and you cant do a thing with him

1:25:35.209 --> 1:25:37.738
or he can be really good

1:25:37.836 --> 1:25:41.339
- What does Cherif get?
A warning about his work

1:25:41.340 --> 1:25:42.883
or his behavior?

1:25:42.884 --> 1:25:44.325
For me, behavior,

1:25:44.343 --> 1:25:45.108
...not work

1:25:45.219 --> 1:25:48.470
- In my class, it's more his work
- That’s a problem.

1:25:48.765 --> 1:25:51.642
It's more like a work problem
looking at his grades.

1:25:51.643 --> 1:25:53.805
Mathematics: 6

1:25:54.897 --> 1:25:56.382
French: 8

1:25:58.567 --> 1:26:01.142
History and geography: 9

1:26:01.278 --> 1:26:04.402
English: 9,5

1:26:04.532 --> 1:26:05.875
Excuse me!

1:26:09.079 --> 1:26:11.872
Science 12. Music 11

1:26:11.873 --> 1:26:14.834
His grades are pretty low but...

1:26:14.835 --> 1:26:18.296
...it seems to be a behavior problem

1:26:18.297 --> 1:26:21.466
Why don't we put that for now
and say he can work harder?

1:26:21.467 --> 1:26:23.732
So I'll put Cherif

1:26:23.970 --> 1:26:27.431
"..." can succeed as long as

1:26:27.432 --> 1:26:30.351
"..." his attitude changes

1:26:30.352 --> 1:26:32.161
... " in relation to his work."

1:26:36.400 --> 1:26:38.902
Let's move on to Souleymane

1:26:38.903 --> 1:26:42.933
Someone else can start.

1:26:43.366 --> 1:26:44.699
What do we say?

1:26:44.700 --> 1:26:46.326
Nothing good.

1:26:46.327 --> 1:26:50.539
- What else?
- We already discussed him

1:26:50.540 --> 1:26:54.752
in the first term. We said it all
He has huge weakness,

1:26:54.753 --> 1:26:56.712
notably in written French

1:26:56.713 --> 1:27:02.218
I don’t think there’s anything
particularly new

1:27:02.219 --> 1:27:03.720
this term

1:27:03.721 --> 1:27:05.153
Feeling better, Esmeralda?

1:27:06.099 --> 1:27:10.026
I didn’t know being class rep
was such fun

1:27:10.145 --> 1:27:12.521
We were talking about Souleymane

1:27:12.522 --> 1:27:13.648
In relation

1:27:13.649 --> 1:27:16.192
to what Francois just said,

1:27:16.193 --> 1:27:21.281
he forgot his things
most of the time this term

1:27:21.282 --> 1:27:23.238
...and didn’t do much

1:27:23.701 --> 1:27:25.848
It’s not just that,
It’s way beyond that

1:27:26.120 --> 1:27:27.606
Sir!

1:27:27.622 --> 1:27:33.044
He’s more and more unruly
He prevents the others from working.

1:27:33.045 --> 1:27:34.378
Can I say something?

1:27:34.379 --> 1:27:36.172
If you put the biscuit away.

1:27:36.173 --> 1:27:41.302
Remember, you aren’t allowed
to eat in classroom

1:27:41.303 --> 1:27:47.303
Well, his overall grade
has gone from 6,75 to 7,25.

1:27:49.270 --> 1:27:52.773
We're not discussing his grades

1:27:52.774 --> 1:27:54.817
...but his behavior for now

1:27:54.818 --> 1:27:56.260
I have the impression

1:27:56.945 --> 1:27:59.989
...we need to consider
disciplinary action

1:27:59.990 --> 1:28:02.075
His attitude's wrong

1:28:02.076 --> 1:28:05.954
It's simple. Every other class
I throw him out

1:28:05.955 --> 1:28:09.500
I don’t even throw
him out anymore,

1:28:09.501 --> 1:28:12.878
...He’s only too happy when I do.

1:28:12.879 --> 1:28:16.382
I don’t think disciplinary action
will help...

1:28:16.383 --> 1:28:17.825
...because things will get

1:28:17.843 --> 1:28:19.677
...really bad then

1:28:19.678 --> 1:28:23.640
They’re already really bad
It’s gone too far.

1:28:23.641 --> 1:28:28.186
It’s like he’s mad at the others
for being normal

1:28:28.188 --> 1:28:29.855
I'll remind you Mr. Marin

1:28:29.856 --> 1:28:33.783
...you brought him to me yesterday.

1:28:33.819 --> 1:28:36.946
Yes, but it was this year's
first incident.

1:28:36.947 --> 1:28:40.617
He was disrespectful, I set a limit

1:28:40.618 --> 1:28:43.161
I did what I did but I don’t think

1:28:43.162 --> 1:28:46.575
it will go any further than that

1:28:47.292 --> 1:28:50.002
I don’t have any real complaints,

1:28:50.003 --> 1:28:51.837
...apart from yesterday

1:28:51.838 --> 1:28:53.965
Our job isn't to make sure

1:28:53.966 --> 1:28:58.094
students sit quietly at the back
and don’t cause any trouble.

1:28:58.095 --> 1:29:00.360
We have to bring them out!

1:29:00.723 --> 1:29:04.184
I won’t do that
with threats or punishment,

1:29:04.185 --> 1:29:08.313
...I'd rather stress his good work.
Some things interest him.

1:29:08.314 --> 1:29:11.275
He can come out
with some pretty good stuff

1:29:11.276 --> 1:29:12.568
Simply because he does

1:29:12.569 --> 1:29:15.349
...something positive now and then,

1:29:16.156 --> 1:29:19.409
...we let him sink
and wallow in his hole...

1:29:19.410 --> 1:29:23.337
...and we do nothing. You
just want to buy social harmony.

1:29:27.043 --> 1:29:28.425
That said,

1:29:28.461 --> 1:29:32.639
what do we say? What do we do?
A warning?

1:29:33.008 --> 1:29:36.135
I don’t think a warnings
what he needs.

1:29:36.136 --> 1:29:40.473
Maybe we should say
he has reached his limit,

1:29:40.474 --> 1:29:43.828
...because he’s
limited scholastically.

1:29:50.026 --> 1:29:53.654
That’s all well and good
but I’m dim and have a line to fill.

1:29:53.655 --> 1:29:55.508
What do we put?

1:29:56.575 --> 1:29:57.957
It’s not right

1:29:57.993 --> 1:29:59.641
...saying that

1:30:07.879 --> 1:30:12.133
Three rhymes per verse.
What do you call that?

1:30:12.134 --> 1:30:13.592
- Verses of three lines... Wey?
- A tercet

1:30:13.593 --> 1:30:15.711
Very good

1:30:16.013 --> 1:30:18.587
And four rhymes would be?

1:30:19.058 --> 1:30:20.543
A quatrain

1:30:21.227 --> 1:30:22.894
From quatre, four

1:30:22.895 --> 1:30:25.480
Tercet, three rhymes.
Quatrain, four

1:30:25.481 --> 1:30:28.358
How many syllabes per line?

1:30:28.359 --> 1:30:29.902
Can you tell me that?
Khoumba.

1:30:29.903 --> 1:30:31.285
I know here are 10

1:30:31.571 --> 1:30:32.905
You know that?

1:30:32.906 --> 1:30:34.615
- Want me to show you?
- Yes.

1:30:34.616 --> 1:30:36.659
"Noir-dans-la-nei-ge...

1:30:36.660 --> 1:30:38.828
... "et-dans-la-bru-me."

1:30:38.829 --> 1:30:40.580
Thats 10

1:30:40.581 --> 1:30:43.083
You say that and...

1:30:43.084 --> 1:30:45.377
...You have two

1:30:45.378 --> 1:30:49.512
...extra syllables
by counting the mute Es.

1:30:49.591 --> 1:30:52.842
Don’t count them, they’re mute

1:30:54.054 --> 1:30:56.790
That makes 8

1:30:56.890 --> 1:30:59.361
...We can underline each syllable

1:30:59.852 --> 1:31:01.936
I'll come back to that one

1:31:01.937 --> 1:31:03.855
Two octosyllables
and one four-syllable line

1:31:03.856 --> 1:31:06.024
- What is it?
- A problem,

1:31:06.025 --> 1:31:08.444
11.47 that makes

1:31:08.445 --> 1:31:09.930
11,5.

1:31:10.155 --> 1:31:11.906
Is 11.47 the number of syllables here?

1:31:11.907 --> 1:31:14.992
No, my grade. It's down!
They lowered my grade!

1:31:14.993 --> 1:31:17.286
What's that to do with poetry?

1:31:17.287 --> 1:31:20.039
11.47 is 11.5

1:31:20.040 --> 1:31:22.000
Who gave you your grade?

1:31:22.001 --> 1:31:24.169
You shouldn't have it yet

1:31:24.170 --> 1:31:26.964
Esmeralda told me

1:31:26.965 --> 1:31:28.882
So the class reps

1:31:28.883 --> 1:31:30.633
...did do something after all

1:31:30.760 --> 1:31:33.231
I took a load of notes!

1:31:33.388 --> 1:31:35.765
I got the impression you weren't

1:31:35.766 --> 1:31:38.309
...really following the meeting
- I noted all!

1:31:38.310 --> 1:31:40.311
Louise, I'm delighted
you've done

1:31:40.312 --> 1:31:42.230
a good job passing on information...

1:31:42.231 --> 1:31:45.276
Let's get back to this poem

1:31:45.568 --> 1:31:49.530
The rule is to count
in front of a consonant...

1:31:49.531 --> 1:31:50.874
A question

1:31:51.157 --> 1:31:52.501
What?

1:31:52.534 --> 1:31:55.244
I heard you really wiped me out

1:31:55.245 --> 1:31:57.413
...at the meeting yesterday

1:31:57.414 --> 1:31:59.499
Another remark about poetry, I see.

1:31:59.500 --> 1:32:01.960
No, it isn’t

1:32:01.961 --> 1:32:05.888
Yes, I know it isn’t about poetry

1:32:05.965 --> 1:32:07.309
What do you mean?

1:32:07.425 --> 1:32:10.985
I dunno. You wiped me out

1:32:12.097 --> 1:32:16.142
Some teachers, not me,

1:32:16.143 --> 1:32:17.481
...said if you carry on like this

1:32:17.519 --> 1:32:21.314
you'll be in trouble,

1:32:21.315 --> 1:32:24.153
...not wiped out.

1:32:24.360 --> 1:32:28.363
That's revenge. I don't get it
Why do for revenge?

1:32:28.364 --> 1:32:30.574
How come it's revenge?

1:32:30.575 --> 1:32:35.913
If you say stuff about me
getting in trouble, that's revenge

1:32:35.914 --> 1:32:39.225
It's not revenge at all

1:32:40.169 --> 1:32:42.087
We're not on the streets

1:32:42.088 --> 1:32:45.424
It's a warning
Our goal here isn't revenge,

1:32:45.425 --> 1:32:48.886
...it's discipline

1:32:48.887 --> 1:32:51.358
- Get the difference?
- I don't get it.

1:32:51.681 --> 1:32:55.226
When a judge sends someone to jail,

1:32:55.227 --> 1:32:58.021
...he doesn't do it to get revenge

1:32:58.022 --> 1:33:00.860
...It helps society run smoothly

1:33:01.025 --> 1:33:04.528
You just want revenge.
You're riffed with me.

1:33:04.529 --> 1:33:06.655
All I care about is revenge?

1:33:06.656 --> 1:33:10.242
I wake up and say
I'll get Souleymane today?

1:33:10.243 --> 1:33:12.476
You insulted him yesterday anyhow.

1:33:12.477 --> 1:33:15.289
He really laid into you!

1:33:15.290 --> 1:33:16.374
I did not.

1:33:16.375 --> 1:33:18.331
What did he say, Louise?

1:33:18.752 --> 1:33:20.837
That you we’re limited.

1:33:20.838 --> 1:33:22.631
...I underlined it, I was so shocked

1:33:22.632 --> 1:33:26.044
Me? Limited?

1:33:28.388 --> 1:33:30.711
Brilliant...

1:33:41.861 --> 1:33:43.945
Esmeralda, Louise,

1:33:43.946 --> 1:33:48.200
...What's your role as class reps?
You represent the students

1:33:48.201 --> 1:33:50.828
to help this class work
or you stir up trouble for me?

1:33:50.829 --> 1:33:52.538
We just do our job.

1:33:52.539 --> 1:33:53.831
Wicked!

1:33:53.832 --> 1:33:55.744
We report on the meeting.

1:33:55.793 --> 1:33:56.557
Of course.

1:33:56.710 --> 1:33:58.667
I didn't realize

1:33:58.671 --> 1:34:00.922
When I saw you snigger

1:34:00.923 --> 1:34:04.092
...at the meeting, I felt bad for you

1:34:04.093 --> 1:34:06.678
It wasn't the place or time

1:34:06.679 --> 1:34:08.165
It didn't look very serious

1:34:09.724 --> 1:34:11.268
Nobody minded in any case

1:34:11.309 --> 1:34:12.601
- They did!
- Only you

1:34:12.602 --> 1:34:16.230
No, it bothered me and I think

1:34:16.231 --> 1:34:18.246
it bothered the others too

1:34:18.525 --> 1:34:20.687
No. It only bothered you

1:34:22.363 --> 1:34:26.497
Sorry, but laughing like that
made you look like two skanks.

1:34:27.160 --> 1:34:29.703
What?
Have you just lost it?

1:34:29.704 --> 1:34:31.048
That's a bad thing!

1:34:33.834 --> 1:34:35.216
You can't dump on us

1:34:35.377 --> 1:34:37.170
The word is insult.

1:34:37.171 --> 1:34:39.380
You're crazy insulting on us.

1:34:39.381 --> 1:34:42.175
You say "dump on" or "insult"

1:34:42.176 --> 1:34:44.761
It's either one or the other, ok.

1:34:44.762 --> 1:34:47.097
Yeah keep on talking!

1:34:47.098 --> 1:34:49.767
In fact I never said
you we’re skanks,

1:34:49.768 --> 1:34:51.185
...I said that at one point

1:34:51.186 --> 1:34:53.521
...in the meeting

1:34:53.522 --> 1:34:56.107
...you acted like skanks.
Understand?

1:34:56.108 --> 1:34:59.235
Don't try to con us,
you said skanks

1:34:59.236 --> 1:35:01.947
I'm just explaining the difference.

1:35:01.948 --> 1:35:04.199
Sir, you don't talk to girls like that!

1:35:04.200 --> 1:35:07.035
Look who's talking!

1:35:07.036 --> 1:35:08.620
...You always insult everybody!

1:35:08.621 --> 1:35:10.581
He wants revenge on the girls

1:35:10.582 --> 1:35:14.710
No way. The noble knight
riding to rescue act,

1:35:14.711 --> 1:35:15.878
...won’t wash!

1:35:15.879 --> 1:35:18.131
You don’t talk to me, man!

1:35:18.132 --> 1:35:20.425
Show some respect!

1:35:20.426 --> 1:35:22.177
I will if I want!

1:35:22.178 --> 1:35:24.221
You're heading for trouble!

1:35:24.222 --> 1:35:25.597
Think you're tough?

1:35:25.598 --> 1:35:28.908
It's a question of discipline!

1:35:29.310 --> 1:35:30.394
I'll take you anytime!

1:35:30.395 --> 1:35:32.021
Stop playing the big short

1:35:32.022 --> 1:35:35.107
- Calm down
- Stay outta this

1:35:35.108 --> 1:35:36.192
Cut it out!

1:35:36.193 --> 1:35:37.860
Don't touch me!

1:35:37.861 --> 1:35:40.613
Don’t touch me.

1:35:40.614 --> 1:35:42.824
You're crazy!

1:35:42.825 --> 1:35:45.149
Cut it out

1:35:47.080 --> 1:35:48.872
What are you doing?

1:35:48.873 --> 1:35:49.799
I'm outta here

1:35:49.916 --> 1:35:52.418
You can't just walk out of my class.

1:35:52.419 --> 1:35:54.045
Are you nuts?

1:35:54.046 --> 1:35:56.172
- Calm down
- Let go of me

1:35:56.173 --> 1:35:57.516
Stop it

1:35:57.591 --> 1:35:59.606
- Let me go
- Ah!

1:36:00.678 --> 1:36:03.096
- Where are you going?
- Let go, fucker

1:36:03.097 --> 1:36:04.441
Pathetic

1:36:16.153 --> 1:36:17.496
Fuck

1:36:30.168 --> 1:36:33.052
What do we do?

1:36:34.214 --> 1:36:39.052
I think we need to convene
the disciplinary committee

1:36:39.053 --> 1:36:41.054
This is starting to add up
it begins

1:36:41.055 --> 1:36:44.015
with disrespect, then the fight,

1:36:44.016 --> 1:36:48.503
...with a student injured,

1:36:48.688 --> 1:36:52.316
...and finally he leaves the class
without permission.

1:36:52.317 --> 1:36:56.446
There was only one incident
and it all spread out from there.

1:36:56.447 --> 1:36:58.489
One thing led to another,

1:36:58.490 --> 1:37:00.505
...a chain reaction.

1:37:00.576 --> 1:37:01.868
Well

1:37:01.869 --> 1:37:05.414
...what I can do is take
a protective measure

1:37:05.415 --> 1:37:07.624
...since this is so serious

1:37:07.625 --> 1:37:11.545
...by suspending Souleymane
for 48 hours.

1:37:11.546 --> 1:37:13.839
That'll give us a little time

1:37:13.840 --> 1:37:16.342
...to reach a decision

1:37:16.343 --> 1:37:17.829
OK.

1:37:18.262 --> 1:37:20.276
Shall we do that?

1:37:20.306 --> 1:37:23.600
However, I need to see you tomorrow.

1:37:23.601 --> 1:37:26.228
Could you come to my office?

1:37:26.229 --> 1:37:29.171
- Good bye.
- Good bye

1:37:30.317 --> 1:37:31.860
Francois!

1:37:33.362 --> 1:37:35.936
I need a word with you

1:37:36.156 --> 1:37:39.200
There's a rumor going around...

1:37:39.201 --> 1:37:41.411
A rumor?

1:37:41.412 --> 1:37:45.957
Some students came to see me
and told me...

1:37:48.169 --> 1:37:50.126
...you insulted them

1:37:52.674 --> 1:37:54.675
Who? Louise and Esmeralda?

1:37:54.676 --> 1:37:56.302
They told me

1:37:56.303 --> 1:37:58.263
...you called them skanks

1:37:58.264 --> 1:38:00.140
...and that led to the incident

1:38:00.141 --> 1:38:01.891
...with Souleymane

1:38:01.892 --> 1:38:04.352
And you believe them?

1:38:04.353 --> 1:38:06.730
That's why I needed to see you.

1:38:06.731 --> 1:38:10.359
You didn't mention it
in your incident report...

1:38:10.360 --> 1:38:14.113
I didn't mention it.
What can I say?

1:38:14.114 --> 1:38:16.407
- Did you do it or not?
- What?

1:38:16.408 --> 1:38:18.242
- Did you...
- Hi!

1:38:18.243 --> 1:38:19.685
Hi.

1:38:19.912 --> 1:38:21.913
Did you call them skanks?

1:38:21.914 --> 1:38:24.332
But Souleymane's another matter!

1:38:24.333 --> 1:38:27.294
I know it had nothing to do with him

1:38:27.295 --> 1:38:30.047
But word's getting around.

1:38:30.048 --> 1:38:32.341
People are talking.
I wanted

1:38:32.342 --> 1:38:35.755
...to let you know
- Thanks for letting me know.

1:38:47.066 --> 1:38:49.902
Hey, you two
You complained about me.

1:38:49.903 --> 1:38:52.477
- Thanks a lot!
- You’re welcome

1:38:52.656 --> 1:38:54.824
You could have talked to me

1:38:54.825 --> 1:38:58.494
Teachers can complain about us
and vice versa, right?

1:38:58.495 --> 1:39:00.348
No, it doesn't work both ways.

1:39:02.625 --> 1:39:04.418
What are you after?

1:39:04.419 --> 1:39:05.801
To see you punished

1:39:05.837 --> 1:39:07.462
- Punished?
- Yes!

1:39:07.463 --> 1:39:11.175
- You, punish me?
- You insulted us, you get punished.

1:39:11.176 --> 1:39:13.052
Where will that get you?

1:39:13.053 --> 1:39:14.720
I'll have spoken out.

1:39:14.721 --> 1:39:17.557
Great, that's a lot of use.

1:39:17.558 --> 1:39:19.726
Do you know what 'skank' means?

1:39:19.727 --> 1:39:22.463
I never called you skanks!

1:39:22.688 --> 1:39:25.218
Yes, you did. For me
skank means prostitute.

1:39:26.901 --> 1:39:28.736
It's not that at all

1:39:28.737 --> 1:39:30.404
For me, it doesn't mean that.

1:39:30.405 --> 1:39:33.199
It's nothing important at all,

1:39:33.200 --> 1:39:36.953
just a girl laughing stupidly

1:39:36.954 --> 1:39:40.205
Hey, skank means prostitute, right?

1:39:40.249 --> 1:39:42.292
You bet!

1:39:42.293 --> 1:39:44.377
- Will Souleymane get expelled?
- No.

1:39:44.378 --> 1:39:47.005
- A disciplinary hearing?
- We don't know yet.

1:39:47.006 --> 1:39:49.299
It's a possibility

1:39:49.300 --> 1:39:52.470
Stop yelling
before anything is decided

1:39:52.471 --> 1:39:55.306
It's all settled anyway

1:39:55.307 --> 1:39:59.435
- Why say that?
- Because it's always the same!

1:39:59.436 --> 1:40:00.770
You're in no position to talk.

1:40:00.771 --> 1:40:04.900
You're the one who got hurt

1:40:04.901 --> 1:40:06.902
He didn't mean it

1:40:06.903 --> 1:40:08.821
There was a metal thing in his bag

1:40:08.822 --> 1:40:12.241
In any case he blew a fuse
and that's bad

1:40:12.242 --> 1:40:13.325
Sir,

1:40:13.326 --> 1:40:14.952
...anyone can blow a fuse

1:40:14.953 --> 1:40:16.954
And then calm down after

1:40:16.955 --> 1:40:18.206
That's not sure

1:40:18.207 --> 1:40:20.083
- You did
- No!

1:40:20.084 --> 1:40:21.427
You're calmer now

1:40:21.544 --> 1:40:23.587
I'm not. You don’t know me!

1:40:23.588 --> 1:40:26.173
All the teachers say
your attitude is perfect now...

1:40:26.174 --> 1:40:30.146
You think you've tamed me?

1:40:30.178 --> 1:40:31.554
No, being sent here helped

1:40:31.555 --> 1:40:35.423
...you understand things, see?

1:40:38.187 --> 1:40:41.648
Teachers helped you

1:40:41.649 --> 1:40:44.192
and we'll do the same
for Souleymane.

1:40:44.193 --> 1:40:48.945
I say teachers who
expel students are fuckers

1:40:51.034 --> 1:40:53.285
Right on.
You want to repeat that?

1:40:53.286 --> 1:40:56.205
- Yeah, fuckers
- Everyone goes wild

1:40:56.206 --> 1:40:58.625
...over some word I said. You
say fucker and I shouldn't react?

1:40:58.626 --> 1:40:59.918
They're fuckers!

1:40:59.919 --> 1:41:02.390
Cut it out!

1:41:02.463 --> 1:41:07.092
You say skanks, we say fucker.
It's the same thing

1:41:07.093 --> 1:41:08.969
They're nothing alike

1:41:08.970 --> 1:41:12.556
A teacher can say certain things
that students can't say.

1:41:12.557 --> 1:41:15.101
Try to understand that!

1:41:15.102 --> 1:41:16.686
We have no right to speak?

1:41:16.687 --> 1:41:20.356
You keep talking all the time!
You never stop speaking

1:41:20.357 --> 1:41:22.734
Whenever we talk, you yell.
What is this?

1:41:22.735 --> 1:41:24.853
Enough...

1:41:32.621 --> 1:41:34.577
Sir!

1:41:36.417 --> 1:41:39.093
- Sir?
- What?

1:41:41.088 --> 1:41:44.398
Will Souleymane get a hearing?

1:41:44.509 --> 1:41:46.627
Give it a rest

1:41:47.220 --> 1:41:50.014
You sound like you want
him to. It fires you up.

1:41:50.015 --> 1:41:53.839
You know what'll happen
if he's expelled?

1:41:53.894 --> 1:41:55.770
He'll change schools.

1:41:55.771 --> 1:41:57.689
No, he won’t change schools.

1:41:57.690 --> 1:42:00.734
It's automatic. It's obligatory.

1:42:00.735 --> 1:42:02.853
That goes for Souleymane too.

1:42:03.821 --> 1:42:06.114
Do you know his father?

1:42:06.115 --> 1:42:08.277
I've seen him once or twice.

1:42:08.284 --> 1:42:09.785
No, you don’t know him!

1:42:09.786 --> 1:42:13.140
If he's expelled, his dad'll
send him back to their village

1:42:13.707 --> 1:42:15.663
Don't get overdramatic

1:42:16.210 --> 1:42:18.328
He'll go back to Mali

1:42:18.504 --> 1:42:22.122
I think we all need
to keep our heads.

1:42:22.592 --> 1:42:23.935
Don’t worry

1:42:37.191 --> 1:42:39.558
You can’t smoke here sir

1:42:41.153 --> 1:42:43.683
I know, but since I was alone

1:43:06.973 --> 1:43:10.267
Ok, you went too far
with those girls.

1:43:10.268 --> 1:43:11.894
We all screw up.

1:43:11.895 --> 1:43:13.980
Souleymane overreacted.

1:43:13.981 --> 1:43:15.314
He's right.

1:43:15.315 --> 1:43:18.443
I saw Khoumba.
Her face was all bloody

1:43:18.444 --> 1:43:20.862
What he did is unacceptable.

1:43:20.863 --> 1:43:22.245
That's for sure.

1:43:22.490 --> 1:43:24.408
I know that.

1:43:24.409 --> 1:43:27.578
His bag hit her by accident.

1:43:27.579 --> 1:43:31.506
A split eybrow bleeds a lot.
That's all.

1:43:31.750 --> 1:43:34.168
You can't ignore it.

1:43:34.169 --> 1:43:39.340
Don't take it to heart.
Seen how they talk to us?

1:43:39.341 --> 1:43:42.928
How's that relevant?
Souleymane is going to get expelled

1:43:42.929 --> 1:43:45.458
...That’s it!

1:43:46.224 --> 1:43:49.107
- No.
- That's kind of logical.

1:43:52.606 --> 1:43:56.166
How many hearings last year?

1:43:58.362 --> 1:44:00.480
12 at least.

1:44:00.740 --> 1:44:02.449
Not that many.

1:44:02.450 --> 1:44:03.533
He could be right.

1:44:03.534 --> 1:44:07.496
I know, I'm on the committee
so I saw them all

1:44:07.497 --> 1:44:12.454
An average of two per month,
12 in all with an expulsion each time

1:44:12.753 --> 1:44:16.214
The hearing is where
we talk things over

1:44:16.215 --> 1:44:19.342
Ok, 12 students were expelled

1:44:19.343 --> 1:44:22.285
but maybe there was no other solution.

1:44:22.346 --> 1:44:25.807
12 out of 12

1:44:25.808 --> 1:44:28.727
...talk about debate!

1:44:28.728 --> 1:44:31.689
But 12 out of 12 just means

1:44:31.690 --> 1:44:36.110
...when a student has a hearing,
it's too late.

1:44:36.111 --> 1:44:37.612
Or it was justified.

1:44:37.613 --> 1:44:40.907
Ok, things happen
that lead to a hearing

1:44:40.908 --> 1:44:43.118
But then what happens?

1:44:43.119 --> 1:44:45.787
What do we expect from a hearing?

1:44:45.788 --> 1:44:47.581
There are prior stages:

1:44:47.582 --> 1:44:50.709
Pre-disciplinary committees,

1:44:50.710 --> 1:44:54.535
...we inform the parents,
the students are warned...

1:44:54.798 --> 1:44:58.176
- Not in this case.
- We've no time.

1:44:58.177 --> 1:45:00.428
It's pretty rare.

1:45:00.429 --> 1:45:04.725
It's rare because we have
this final punishment

1:45:04.726 --> 1:45:07.811
...that allows us to ignore
the prior steps.

1:45:07.812 --> 1:45:11.166
And even if we did use them,

1:45:11.191 --> 1:45:14.751
...the simple fact
of expelling a student...

1:45:14.861 --> 1:45:19.240
...is a disavowal
of everything we have tried.

1:45:19.241 --> 1:45:23.245
Ok, but it's Souleymane's chance
to justify himself

1:45:23.246 --> 1:45:26.123
At a hearing, you don't speak.

1:45:26.124 --> 1:45:29.168
You're scared. You're paralyzed.

1:45:29.169 --> 1:45:30.586
Exactly.

1:45:30.587 --> 1:45:32.880
Let me sum up.

1:45:32.881 --> 1:45:36.843
He'll get a disciplinary hearing,
he'll be expelled

1:45:36.844 --> 1:45:39.679
and maybe even sent back to Mali

1:45:39.680 --> 1:45:41.931
You're being overdramatic.

1:45:41.932 --> 1:45:43.850
No, I'm not

1:45:43.851 --> 1:45:47.479
Students who know him better
than any of us here,

1:45:47.480 --> 1:45:52.026
...who know his father,
say that he is likely Mali...

1:45:52.027 --> 1:45:54.248
to send him back to Mali after this

1:45:55.239 --> 1:45:58.180
Some are threatened

1:45:58.367 --> 1:46:01.536
...with boarding school
but in never happens

1:46:01.537 --> 1:46:03.759
It can happen.

1:46:03.789 --> 1:46:07.835
A lot of parents spend their time

1:46:07.836 --> 1:46:12.381
...threatening their kids with that.
You can't take it into account

1:46:12.382 --> 1:46:17.804
- Even if there was just a slight risk
that a hearing could lead

1:46:17.805 --> 1:46:22.292
to him being sent back,
I don't think I can take that risk.

1:46:24.020 --> 1:46:26.229
It's like when you hesitate

1:46:26.230 --> 1:46:29.191
...over punishing a kid
because when he goes home,

1:46:29.192 --> 1:46:31.694
once that door closes,

1:46:31.695 --> 1:46:34.071
...he'll get a beating
from his parents

1:46:34.072 --> 1:46:36.866
We've all seen that

1:46:36.867 --> 1:46:38.201
...But we still have to punish

1:46:38.202 --> 1:46:40.745
them when they go too far

1:46:40.746 --> 1:46:43.081
Whatever the consequences

1:46:43.082 --> 1:46:45.042
which don't

1:46:45.043 --> 1:46:47.044
...concern you!

1:46:47.045 --> 1:46:48.879
So I ignore that?

1:46:48.880 --> 1:46:51.882
I know punishment
can have such a consequence,

1:46:51.883 --> 1:46:54.767
...but I turn a blind eye, is that it?

1:46:55.804 --> 1:46:58.598
You can't take it into account
in every case

1:46:58.599 --> 1:47:01.559
The violence...

1:47:01.560 --> 1:47:05.021
him being sent back...

1:47:05.022 --> 1:47:07.900
- No more Christmas presents...
- True, you have to consider it

1:47:07.901 --> 1:47:09.244
but after a while...

1:47:09.486 --> 1:47:11.779
It's a question of principle

1:47:11.780 --> 1:47:14.282
...We each have a role to play

1:47:14.283 --> 1:47:17.695
We can't substitute
ourselves for the parents

1:47:18.871 --> 1:47:21.289
Sorry, but if I rewind the movie,

1:47:21.290 --> 1:47:24.918
...it's a weird chain of events.
It starts with reprimands,

1:47:24.919 --> 1:47:28.505
...when Souleymane forget
his things, talks back.

1:47:28.506 --> 1:47:32.218
We punish him. Again and again,

1:47:32.219 --> 1:47:34.637
until a disciplinary hearing

1:47:34.638 --> 1:47:38.391
leading to who knows what
Everything gets out of hand

1:47:38.392 --> 1:47:40.935
Sure, looking at it that way

1:47:40.936 --> 1:47:43.438
it's really shocking

1:47:43.439 --> 1:47:48.235
But the school won't
expelling Souleymane

1:47:48.236 --> 1:47:51.648
He's been gone for a while

1:48:28.822 --> 1:48:32.950
Francois, I didn't
expect you so soon.

1:48:32.951 --> 1:48:36.467
Have you reached a decision?

1:48:36.538 --> 1:48:40.260
I don't think I have much choice.

1:48:45.256 --> 1:48:47.299
By the way, Julie told me...

1:48:47.300 --> 1:48:50.594
you had a heated exchange

1:48:50.595 --> 1:48:52.888
...with two girls in your class.

1:48:52.889 --> 1:48:56.726
Yes, the two class reps
but it happened first so

1:48:56.727 --> 1:48:59.979
You apparently
called them "skanks"

1:48:59.980 --> 1:49:01.982
Let's say that, yes

1:49:01.983 --> 1:49:06.361
That complicates things,
but the problem remains.

1:49:06.362 --> 1:49:09.490
I'd like you to mention it
in your report

1:49:09.491 --> 1:49:14.078
I don't want it used against us
at the disciplinary hearing.

1:49:14.079 --> 1:49:17.457
Don't bother hiding it,
just write it down.

1:49:17.458 --> 1:49:19.267
I understand.

1:49:20.878 --> 1:49:23.421
I'll let you reread this

1:49:23.422 --> 1:49:26.466
before we launch the procedure.

1:49:26.467 --> 1:49:29.553
So I... I just need to add...

1:49:29.554 --> 1:49:32.805
Yes, without going into detail.

1:49:33.475 --> 1:49:35.142
Does that suit you?

1:49:35.143 --> 1:49:36.687
OK.

1:50:05.385 --> 1:50:09.357
Can you take the minute.

1:50:22.486 --> 1:50:24.192
- Hello
- Hello.

1:50:24.822 --> 1:50:26.365
Hello, sir.

1:50:26.366 --> 1:50:28.793
- Please sit down.
- Thanks.

1:51:03.739 --> 1:51:07.784
"Carl tried to reason with him,
but Souleyman broke free,"

1:51:07.785 --> 1:51:10.955
"winging his bag that hit Khoumba
in the face."

1:51:10.956 --> 1:51:14.458
"He left, insulting everyone
and slamming the door."

1:51:14.459 --> 1:51:17.754
"I didn't go after him
because I needed..."

1:51:17.755 --> 1:51:21.466
"to help Khoumba
whose eybrow was bleeding."

1:51:21.467 --> 1:51:25.429
Those are the facts
that led to today's hearing

1:51:25.430 --> 1:51:29.642
Madame, it doesn't mean
Souleyman is a bad boy.

1:51:29.643 --> 1:51:32.019
That's not we're saying

1:51:32.020 --> 1:51:34.897
But, sometimes,
a student in a class

1:51:34.898 --> 1:51:38.776
through voluntary or
involuntary behavior,

1:51:38.777 --> 1:51:41.196
can create an atmosphere that...

1:51:41.197 --> 1:51:44.388
...prevents the class from working.

1:51:58.716 --> 1:52:02.232
Do you understand
what we're saying?

1:52:03.221 --> 1:52:04.805
If I may say something, it's true

1:52:04.806 --> 1:52:07.349
there had been number of signs

1:52:07.350 --> 1:52:10.394
that should have warned us.

1:52:10.395 --> 1:52:13.381
We could have reacted sooner

1:52:13.940 --> 1:52:17.735
But how we have to deal
with an incident

1:52:17.736 --> 1:52:20.113
that is fairy violent

1:52:20.114 --> 1:52:22.490
and that's simply unacceptable.

1:52:22.491 --> 1:52:27.287
I'd like to know
if you realize that, Souleymane?

1:52:30.208 --> 1:52:34.170
We're not saying you're
deliberately violent.

1:52:34.171 --> 1:52:37.715
The problem is you can't control
what you say,

1:52:37.716 --> 1:52:39.834
...and what you do

1:52:41.095 --> 1:52:43.763
You're here to express
your point of view.

1:52:43.764 --> 1:52:47.935
Go ahead

1:52:47.936 --> 1:52:51.188
I don't give a damn.
I've got nothing to say

1:52:51.189 --> 1:52:53.455
Do whatever you want to do

1:53:03.619 --> 1:53:05.532
Excuse me...

1:53:15.215 --> 1:53:17.068
Can you translate?

1:53:17.843 --> 1:53:20.476
She says I'm a good boy

1:53:22.682 --> 1:53:24.270
I do my homework.

1:53:30.690 --> 1:53:36.119
I help my brothers and sisters
with their work when I can

1:53:40.576 --> 1:53:46.108
I always wash the dishes
and help her when I can

1:53:48.001 --> 1:53:52.004
We don't doubt he's a good son.
That's not the problem.

1:53:52.005 --> 1:53:53.673
Let's consider

1:53:53.674 --> 1:53:55.591
...his school record

1:53:55.592 --> 1:53:58.970
Excuse me, but could we focus
on the facts here?

1:53:58.971 --> 1:54:01.848
Firstly, I'd like to say

1:54:01.849 --> 1:54:06.520
...that we're surprised to see
the teacher involved in the incident

1:54:06.521 --> 1:54:08.397
...on this committee

1:54:08.398 --> 1:54:11.074
We find it highly irregular

1:54:12.652 --> 1:54:15.963
It's true. It's odd
to be both judge and litigant.

1:54:16.156 --> 1:54:17.657
First of all,

1:54:17.658 --> 1:54:21.286
...Mr. Marin was elected
to the administrative board.

1:54:21.287 --> 1:54:23.747
as the teachers' representative

1:54:23.748 --> 1:54:28.001
Moreover, I think
that the incident...

1:54:28.002 --> 1:54:30.421
...that occurred in
Mr. Marin's class

1:54:30.422 --> 1:54:33.299
...doesn't involve the teacher
directly.

1:54:33.300 --> 1:54:35.510
I'm sorry, you mention

1:54:35.511 --> 1:54:38.638
...some harsh words

1:54:38.639 --> 1:54:40.181
...spoken by the teacher...

1:54:40.182 --> 1:54:43.143
Apparently, you used
the word "skanks"

1:54:43.144 --> 1:54:46.021
...to describe the class reps.
And that's a problem

1:54:46.022 --> 1:54:47.648
I did say that

1:54:47.649 --> 1:54:50.943
...but it wasn’t something
that concerned Souleymane.

1:54:50.944 --> 1:54:55.031
I think he used the excuse
of a rather heated exchange

1:54:55.032 --> 1:54:57.075
...to express the bad mood

1:54:57.076 --> 1:55:00.745
that he was in that day.

1:55:00.746 --> 1:55:02.539
He tried to defend them

1:55:02.540 --> 1:55:04.958
So I feel that it's relevant

1:55:04.959 --> 1:55:08.045
Sorry, but absolutely
nothing justifies

1:55:08.046 --> 1:55:11.173
...being disrespectful to a teacher,

1:55:11.174 --> 1:55:16.234
...insulting everyone and leaving
a class without permission.

1:55:17.765 --> 1:55:20.956
Souleymane, do you
have anything to say?

1:55:21.978 --> 1:55:24.714
I don't know. What can I say?

1:55:34.700 --> 1:55:36.347
Souleymane?

1:55:38.662 --> 1:55:42.531
- What did she say?
- The same thing again

1:55:53.136 --> 1:55:54.886
Souleymane?

1:55:55.430 --> 1:55:58.269
She apologizes on my behalf.

1:57:03.337 --> 1:57:05.970
You can come back in now.

1:57:28.865 --> 1:57:31.617
Madame, the committee
has conferred

1:57:31.618 --> 1:57:35.705
and has decided to expel Souleymane
from the school for good.

1:57:35.706 --> 1:57:39.417
You will receive the ruling
by registered mail

1:57:39.418 --> 1:57:42.463
...and have eight days to appeal,

1:57:49.971 --> 1:57:55.134
We shall do our best to find
Souleymane another school

1:57:57.938 --> 1:58:00.365
Goodbye, Messieurs, Mesdames

1:58:03.444 --> 1:58:09.181
Souleymane, come to see me
before the end of the week, please.

1:58:41.110 --> 1:58:43.125
Mathematical proportionality.

1:58:44.322 --> 1:58:49.493
This year, you learned
mathematical proportionality?

1:58:49.494 --> 1:58:53.706
- I liked science
- What you learned, not liked.

1:58:53.707 --> 1:58:56.584
If you liked it, you learned.

1:58:56.585 --> 1:58:58.703
So what did you learn?

1:58:59.046 --> 1:59:03.008
All about volcanoes, earthquakes,

1:59:03.009 --> 1:59:04.801
...plates...

1:59:04.802 --> 1:59:07.429
Convergence and divergence,

1:59:07.430 --> 1:59:10.946
...movement of the Earth's plates,

1:59:11.518 --> 1:59:13.853
- It was fascinating.
- It interested you?

1:59:13.854 --> 1:59:15.296
- Yeah.
- Good.

1:59:15.981 --> 1:59:20.026
Well, in mathematics,

1:59:20.027 --> 1:59:22.487
.. trigonometry Pythagoras
theorem, Thales theorem.

1:59:22.488 --> 1:59:24.322
I'll stop you there.

1:59:24.323 --> 1:59:27.743
You can't sit there and brag...

1:59:27.744 --> 1:59:30.495
...you learned Pythagoras theorem.
Recite it for us

1:59:33.875 --> 1:59:35.877
If, in a triangle

1:59:35.878 --> 1:59:40.131
...two sides are equal to

1:59:40.132 --> 1:59:42.509
...If the square rot

1:59:42.510 --> 1:59:44.177
If the square of two sides

1:59:44.178 --> 1:59:48.105
is equal to the square

1:59:48.224 --> 1:59:50.976
...the square of the hypotenuse

1:59:50.977 --> 1:59:53.199
then the triangle's a rectangle.

1:59:53.814 --> 1:59:55.773
More or less, yes

1:59:55.774 --> 1:59:57.316
It's spot on

1:59:57.317 --> 2:00:00.570
All right. I believe you.

2:00:00.571 --> 2:00:03.657
In history, I learned
about triangular trade.

2:00:03.658 --> 2:00:09.086
The fact that ships left Europe...

2:00:09.497 --> 2:00:13.709
...with manufactured goods that
they took to Africa to trade for men,

2:00:13.710 --> 2:00:16.587
...who’d became slaves
that they took to America to work.

2:00:16.588 --> 2:00:20.216
Then they took the money
they made back to Europe.

2:00:20.217 --> 2:00:22.747
That's triangular trade

2:00:23.429 --> 2:00:25.013
Chemistry

2:00:25.014 --> 2:00:27.176
What in chemistry?

2:00:27.225 --> 2:00:29.078
Combustion

2:00:29.269 --> 2:00:30.686
What's that?

2:00:30.687 --> 2:00:35.149
Blending Fehling's solution
and glucose.

2:00:35.150 --> 2:00:36.494
What do you get?

2:00:36.944 --> 2:00:39.696
Heat up test-tube,

2:00:39.697 --> 2:00:41.918
...and it changes color.

2:00:43.284 --> 2:00:46.370
- What's the interest?
- The interest?

2:00:46.371 --> 2:00:51.902
I dunno. Why teach it to us
if there's no interest?

2:00:52.085 --> 2:00:53.835
Reproduction

2:00:55.422 --> 2:00:59.133
What did you learn
about human reproduction?

2:00:59.134 --> 2:01:01.091
Human reproduction...

2:01:01.095 --> 2:01:03.669
Well, the sperm

2:01:03.848 --> 2:01:05.657
...gets into the ovum

2:01:05.683 --> 2:01:07.559
then you wait 9 months,

2:01:07.560 --> 2:01:11.840
then you do a sonogram
and then it comes out

2:01:11.898 --> 2:01:13.281
The sperm does?

2:01:13.400 --> 2:01:14.743
No, the baby

2:01:15.360 --> 2:01:17.993
The human being that's inside.

2:01:18.113 --> 2:01:20.335
- Khoumba?
- Me?

2:01:20.533 --> 2:01:22.659
Yes. That is your name?

2:01:22.660 --> 2:01:24.042
Yes.

2:01:26.039 --> 2:01:30.937
In music, I learned to play
the alto recorder...

2:01:31.044 --> 2:01:33.000
and in Spanish

2:01:33.463 --> 2:01:35.131
The recorder in Spanish?

2:01:35.132 --> 2:01:37.759
No, in music, I learned

2:01:37.760 --> 2:01:40.678
to play the alto recorder.
- Right

2:01:40.679 --> 2:01:42.889
- And other stuff in Spanish
- Good.

2:01:42.890 --> 2:01:46.141
Can you say something
to us in Spanish?

2:01:53.986 --> 2:01:58.472
- And that means?
- "It's the vacation soon".

2:02:01.619 --> 2:02:03.781
I didn't learn anything

2:02:04.789 --> 2:02:09.460
You cant spend 9 months at
school and not learn anything.

2:02:09.461 --> 2:02:12.421
I'm the living proof

2:02:12.422 --> 2:02:15.174
You got something
from the books we read.

2:02:15.175 --> 2:02:17.427
- Your books are shite.
- They're what?

2:02:17.428 --> 2:02:19.340
They're useless.

2:02:19.889 --> 2:02:23.713
What about a book
you read by yourself?

2:02:24.936 --> 2:02:27.020
The books I read?

2:02:27.021 --> 2:02:30.213
Well, there's The Republic

2:02:33.695 --> 2:02:35.078
Platon’s "Republic"?

2:02:35.405 --> 2:02:38.818
You read that?

2:02:39.326 --> 2:02:40.914
How come?

2:02:41.495 --> 2:02:44.706
My big sister had it

2:02:44.707 --> 2:02:47.752
- She does philosophy?
- No, law

2:02:48.378 --> 2:02:50.025
So what's it about?

2:02:50.380 --> 2:02:53.425
Well, there's this guy...

2:02:53.550 --> 2:02:54.992
His name's Socrates

2:02:55.010 --> 2:02:56.716
Yeah, Socrates.

2:02:58.055 --> 2:03:02.394
He stops people in the street
and asks them:

2:03:02.810 --> 2:03:05.729
"Are you sure of thinking
what you think?"

2:03:05.730 --> 2:03:08.774
"Are you sure of doing
what you do? and so on?"

2:03:08.775 --> 2:03:12.027
After that, people
start getting confused.

2:03:12.028 --> 2:03:13.988
They ask questions.

2:03:13.989 --> 2:03:16.003
The guy's too much

2:03:16.200 --> 2:03:18.576
What does he ask people about?

2:03:18.577 --> 2:03:20.078
Everything.

2:03:20.079 --> 2:03:26.066
Love, religion, God
people, everything

2:03:26.461 --> 2:03:28.519
- It's good you read it
- I know

2:03:28.797 --> 2:03:31.326
It's not a skank's book!

2:03:36.930 --> 2:03:41.351
Wait a second. Before you leave,
here are your self-portraits

2:03:41.352 --> 2:03:45.397
One by one. When you have
yours, you can go.

2:03:45.398 --> 2:03:47.310
What is it?

2:03:51.530 --> 2:03:52.988
What is it?

2:03:52.989 --> 2:03:56.284
These are the self-portraits
that you wrote

2:03:56.285 --> 2:03:59.120
...and that we made up
with the class photo and so on

2:03:59.121 --> 2:04:00.665
You too, Eva.

2:04:03.042 --> 2:04:04.792
You don't have one?

2:04:07.171 --> 2:04:10.341
- You look good in it
- Cut it out

2:04:10.342 --> 2:04:13.344
You're like a leader

2:04:13.345 --> 2:04:15.257
Very good.

2:04:16.098 --> 2:04:18.260
- Good bye, Sir.
- Good bye.

2:04:19.310 --> 2:04:22.295
- Have a good vacation.
- You too

2:04:28.611 --> 2:04:30.833
- Sir?
- Yes...

2:04:32.240 --> 2:04:34.358
What is it?

2:04:35.285 --> 2:04:37.403
I didn't learn anything

2:04:38.497 --> 2:04:41.174
What? That doesn't mean anything

2:04:42.418 --> 2:04:45.879
Earlier, all the others...

2:04:45.880 --> 2:04:48.925
...said they'd learned something

2:04:49.467 --> 2:04:52.247
Compared to them, I learned nothing

2:04:53.096 --> 2:04:55.264
You learned as much as them

2:04:55.265 --> 2:04:57.725
They had to think hard too.

2:04:57.726 --> 2:04:59.769
It's not easy

2:04:59.770 --> 2:05:05.233
to remember what you learned...

2:05:05.234 --> 2:05:07.249
But I don't understand

2:05:07.946 --> 2:05:09.328
What do you mean?

2:05:09.906 --> 2:05:12.533
I don't understand what we do.

2:05:12.534 --> 2:05:14.283
In French?

2:05:14.745 --> 2:05:16.450
In school

2:05:17.831 --> 2:05:22.919
You can’t say you don’t
understand everything.

2:05:22.920 --> 2:05:25.142
That’s not true...

2:05:27.801 --> 2:05:30.992
I don’t want to go
to vocational school.

2:05:31.555 --> 2:05:34.644
There’s no question of that yet

2:05:34.850 --> 2:05:37.277
You’re moving on to the next year.

2:05:37.770 --> 2:05:42.190
You’ll have plenty of time
to think about your future

2:05:42.191 --> 2:05:45.569
Vocational school isn’t
an absolute certainty

2:05:45.570 --> 2:05:48.615
It all depends on how you do next year

2:05:49.908 --> 2:05:51.613
But I don’t want to.
