WEBVTT

00:04.340 --> 00:06.241
Boy, you're up early.

00:06.243 --> 00:08.877
Oh, yeah, the ribs have
been acting fussy all night,

00:08.879 --> 00:11.680
so I got up at 4:00 and
I swaddled them in foil,

00:11.682 --> 00:13.615
and I've been checking their
temperature every couple hours,

00:13.617 --> 00:14.949
make sure they're not running hot.

00:14.951 --> 00:16.484
Oh, you're such a good daddy,

00:16.486 --> 00:18.353
taking care of your little meat babies.

00:18.355 --> 00:19.554
- (laughs)
- (laughs)

00:19.556 --> 00:21.256
You nurture them the best you can,

00:21.258 --> 00:23.858
and if they fall, you
hope it's off the bone.

00:23.860 --> 00:27.195
I'm jealous that I'm not gonna
be able to join you and the guys

00:27.197 --> 00:28.263
for your little brunch.

00:28.265 --> 00:29.864
- Brunch? Men don't brunch.
- Oh.

00:29.866 --> 00:33.234
We watch sports, and then eat
ourselves into a beef coma.

00:33.236 --> 00:35.136
Oh. You want to hear about my exciting day?

00:35.138 --> 00:37.171
I'm gonna lock myself in
a room with your mother

00:37.173 --> 00:40.241
until we finish that book, or
until one of us ends up dead.

00:40.243 --> 00:41.743
I'd like to say my money's on you,

00:41.745 --> 00:43.244
- but I know my mom.
- (Molly scoffs)

00:43.246 --> 00:44.912
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.

00:44.914 --> 00:47.315
I still have ten minutes
before I have to leave.

00:47.317 --> 00:50.017
I guess we can do it,
but I'd have to pee first.

00:50.019 --> 00:53.521
I know. I'm talking about
just sitting and talking.

00:53.523 --> 00:55.356
For the whole ten minutes?

00:56.525 --> 00:57.825
Let's sit.

00:59.328 --> 01:01.395
(sighs)

01:01.397 --> 01:03.464
Your mother is dragging
out this writing process.

01:03.466 --> 01:05.800
It's starting to feel
like it's never gonna end.

01:05.802 --> 01:07.768
- She's just so incred...
- Difficult?

01:07.770 --> 01:09.270
- Yeah, that, but...
- Crotchety?

01:09.272 --> 01:12.006
- Yes, but more than...
- Awful?

01:13.475 --> 01:15.577
Mike, can I finish my own sentence?

01:16.579 --> 01:19.580
Your mother's being incredibly obstinate.

01:19.582 --> 01:23.384
Does "obstinate" mean
difficult, crotchety and awful?

01:23.386 --> 01:26.120
Yes, actually, it does.

01:26.182 --> 01:28.148
I don't think you get

01:28.150 --> 01:30.117
what it's like working with your mother.

01:30.119 --> 01:31.452
You know, the first half hour,

01:31.454 --> 01:33.120
it's just a gripe session
about the neighbors.

01:33.122 --> 01:34.521
And then I got to sit there

01:34.523 --> 01:36.023
while she checks the dog for tumors.

01:36.025 --> 01:37.191
Then she checks herself.

01:37.193 --> 01:39.359
And then she asks me to check her.

01:39.361 --> 01:43.463
Welcome to the first 18 years of my life.

01:43.465 --> 01:45.399
It's just so frustrating.

01:45.401 --> 01:47.201
Oh, I mean, you signed on for this.

01:47.203 --> 01:49.770
But you're almost done, so just suck it up.

01:49.772 --> 01:51.705
"Suck it up"?

01:51.707 --> 01:53.273
Well, you wanted my advice.

01:53.275 --> 01:55.375
No, I didn't. I'm just talking to you.

01:55.377 --> 01:58.712
Okay, but we talked. I gave a solution.

01:58.714 --> 02:01.081
How much longer do we need to sit here?

02:01.083 --> 02:04.785
Wow. I didn't realize talking
to your wife is such a chore.

02:04.787 --> 02:06.920
No, it... it's just, you don't
need the whole ten minutes

02:06.922 --> 02:08.854
to tell me what kind of hell you're in.

02:08.857 --> 02:10.624
You had me at "working with my mother."

02:10.626 --> 02:12.192
Okay, you know what? Don't worry about me.

02:12.194 --> 02:13.593
Just go back to your little ribs.

02:13.595 --> 02:15.295
Oh, come on, what are
you getting so mad about?

02:15.297 --> 02:17.964
I listened to you whine about
my mom, and I'm the bad guy?

02:17.966 --> 02:19.766
Oh, I'm whining? Is that what I'm doing?

02:19.768 --> 02:23.303
I was gonna say something else,
but you hate that "B" word.

02:23.305 --> 02:26.673
You know what? Some days, you
really suck at being a husband.

02:26.675 --> 02:27.774
This is on you!

02:27.776 --> 02:30.010
I told you we should have just had sex!

(indistinct sportscast on TV)

03:04.395 --> 03:05.928
Mmm!

03:05.930 --> 03:07.396
Boy, you better put "cooking ribs"

03:07.398 --> 03:09.131
on a list of things you have mastered.

03:09.133 --> 03:10.532
Along with the seven-minute nap

03:10.534 --> 03:12.868
and opening a beer bottle
with your eye socket.

03:12.870 --> 03:16.305
Only twist tops, but thank you.

03:16.307 --> 03:17.940
Doesn't get any better than this.

03:17.942 --> 03:19.441
Eating pork and watching the play-offs

03:19.443 --> 03:20.943
with three of my favorite people.

03:20.945 --> 03:23.312
Plus the guy who made the Costco run.

03:23.314 --> 03:27.482
That membership has got me
invites to many a shindig.

03:27.484 --> 03:30.352
A gym membership might help, too.

03:30.354 --> 03:34.689
I'm sorry. Does the gym
have one-dollar hot dogs?

03:37.994 --> 03:39.461
What, you're not eating?

03:39.463 --> 03:41.429
Ah, I kind of got a lot on my mind.

03:41.431 --> 03:42.931
- Molly and I got in a fight.
- Mmm.

03:42.933 --> 03:44.299
You know what's not a fight?

03:44.301 --> 03:45.500
Getting the meat off this bone.

03:45.502 --> 03:46.701
Tender as hell.

03:46.703 --> 03:48.803
I still don't know what I did wrong.

03:48.805 --> 03:51.306
She had a ten-minute problem
that I solved in three,

03:51.308 --> 03:52.641
and now I'm a horrible husband.

03:52.643 --> 03:54.509
Well, see, the key is not to get trapped

03:54.511 --> 03:56.011
in that conversation in the first place.

03:56.013 --> 03:57.979
Yeah, you gotta always give
yourself an escape route.

03:57.981 --> 03:59.547
You know, pretend to fall asleep, hmm?

03:59.549 --> 04:01.149
Take a phantom phone call.

04:01.151 --> 04:03.284
My go-to... grab my stomach, say "Uh-oh,"

04:03.286 --> 04:05.387
and high-tail it out of the room.

04:06.722 --> 04:08.123
That works with mothers, too,

04:08.125 --> 04:09.891
except mine will follow
you into the bathroom,

04:09.893 --> 04:12.794
so you better have something
to back up that "Uh-oh."

04:12.796 --> 04:14.495
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

04:14.497 --> 04:16.430
I mean, she... she won't pick up the phone,

04:16.433 --> 04:17.665
she won't answer my texts.

04:17.666 --> 04:19.033
I don't know how to fix this.

04:19.035 --> 04:20.601
You know what you might want to try?

04:20.603 --> 04:23.438
Keeping it to yourself
till the end of the game.

04:24.707 --> 04:26.107
Yeah, I'm sorry, are we here

04:26.109 --> 04:27.976
to talk about each other's
problems, or watch hockey?

04:27.978 --> 04:29.143
Seriously, Mike, are you going

04:29.145 --> 04:30.611
to watch this period, or have one?

04:30.613 --> 04:31.913
All right...

04:31.915 --> 04:33.881
(laughter)

04:41.723 --> 04:44.091
Okay, so, right now, we see a young Peggy

04:44.093 --> 04:46.627
breathing in the town of
Mudlick for the last time.

04:46.629 --> 04:48.563
- She thinks she's free.
- Uh-huh.

04:48.565 --> 04:52.166
Then I thought Troy could lean
over and roll up her window.

04:52.168 --> 04:54.335
You know, to show he's
controlling, like her father.

04:54.337 --> 04:56.537
- Cycle goes unbroken.
- Uh-huh.

05:00.342 --> 05:03.310
Then a horde of zombies
emerges from the cornfields

05:03.312 --> 05:05.479
and does the "Thriller" dance.

05:05.481 --> 05:08.482
What do you think that is? Mole or tumor?

05:08.484 --> 05:11.452
We're supposed to be writing.

05:11.454 --> 05:14.588
How can I write when my
dog's dying in my arms?

05:14.590 --> 05:17.158
Just give him to me! He...

05:17.160 --> 05:20.594
It's a piece of caramel corn.

05:20.596 --> 05:22.630
No wonder you were licking at it.

05:22.632 --> 05:25.666
You're my little Cracker Jack, aren't you?

05:25.668 --> 05:27.634
Can we please just focus?

05:27.636 --> 05:29.370
We are so close to finishing.

05:29.372 --> 05:31.138
I'm here. I'm working.

05:31.140 --> 05:33.540
So, what do you think? The cycle continues?

05:33.542 --> 05:36.977
(sighs) I think I need
to change my sweater.

05:36.979 --> 05:40.714
Why? Is that one losing its mothball smell?

05:40.716 --> 05:44.117
It's too flashy. I feel like a whore.

05:44.119 --> 05:47.955
Do you like the rolling-up-
the-window idea or not?

05:47.957 --> 05:50.724
No, but I like that
thing about the zombies.

05:50.726 --> 05:52.059
Okay...

05:52.061 --> 05:53.260
Don't worry. If we can't think

05:53.262 --> 05:54.595
of anything better, we'll figure it out

05:54.597 --> 05:56.697
as soon as I give Jim a bath. Come on, Jim.

05:56.699 --> 06:00.100
(clicks tongue) Take a tub with Mommy.

06:00.402 --> 06:02.736
Fine, but we have to finish this!

06:02.738 --> 06:04.671
If you're not down here in ten minutes,

06:04.673 --> 06:07.174
I am climbing in with you!

06:09.243 --> 06:11.645
(men cheering)

06:11.647 --> 06:14.147
I don't know what it is,
but there's something sexy

06:14.149 --> 06:16.850
- about a room full of guys watching sports.
- Mm-hmm.

06:16.852 --> 06:19.786
Makes sense. Ever since they
started sitting down to pee,

06:19.788 --> 06:23.056
it's really the only manly thing they do.

06:23.058 --> 06:25.759
Unbelievable!

06:25.761 --> 06:26.927
What's wrong?

06:26.929 --> 06:28.261
I don't want to talk about it.

06:28.263 --> 06:29.229
Oh, all right, we'll leave you alone.

06:29.231 --> 06:30.563
I spent all night

06:30.565 --> 06:32.632
sweating over a hot stove for those guys,

06:32.634 --> 06:33.933
and they can't take five minutes

06:33.935 --> 06:36.369
to listen to what's going on in my life?

06:36.371 --> 06:39.639
Men. They can hear a pair of
high heels from two blocks away,

06:39.641 --> 06:41.408
but tell 'em about Suzanne at work

06:41.410 --> 06:43.276
who stole your haircut,
it's like they're deaf.

06:43.278 --> 06:44.944
I think she was just insecure

06:44.946 --> 06:46.846
'cause you slept with her boyfriend.

06:46.848 --> 06:48.314
Okay, that was three years ago.

06:48.316 --> 06:49.549
I also slept with Leanna's,

06:49.551 --> 06:52.018
but she was mature enough
to just slash my tires, so...

06:52.020 --> 06:54.320
Okay. So, what is it?

06:54.322 --> 06:55.822
What makes Mongo mad?

06:55.824 --> 06:59.659
Well, this morning, Molly
said I suck at being a husband.

06:59.661 --> 07:00.994
- Mmm.
- Oh. You know how many times

07:00.996 --> 07:03.029
- she's told me I suck at being a mother?
- A lot.

07:04.331 --> 07:06.532
Molly was going on and on about my mom,

07:06.534 --> 07:08.134
like... like she always does, right?

07:08.136 --> 07:10.269
So, I thought I'd save us both some time

07:10.271 --> 07:14.006
by offering a solution that
she was not ready to hear.

07:14.008 --> 07:16.609
Mike, nobody wants to be told what to do.

07:16.611 --> 07:19.679
As a strong woman, I want to be heard.

07:19.681 --> 07:21.948
Even if you've told me the
same thing over and over again?

07:21.950 --> 07:24.016
Especially if I've told
you over and over again.

07:24.018 --> 07:27.086
When we talk to you, we don't
want to know what you think.

07:27.088 --> 07:28.287
Uh-uh.

07:28.289 --> 07:29.322
You're just a sounding board

07:29.324 --> 07:31.023
so that we can look at our problem

07:31.025 --> 07:32.358
from every different angle.

07:32.360 --> 07:35.995
So, it's the journey
to get to the solution.

07:35.997 --> 07:37.697
- Mm...
- Oh, who cares about the solution?

07:37.699 --> 07:40.032
- See, you're doing it right now.
- Yeah.

07:40.034 --> 07:41.667
- You're trying to figure things out.
- Mm-hmm.

07:41.669 --> 07:43.202
Just listen.

07:47.541 --> 07:50.276
That's the smartest thing
you didn't say all day.

07:54.681 --> 07:57.732
(whirring) Peggy?

08:00.001 --> 08:01.535
God!

08:01.537 --> 08:03.204
Peggy!

08:03.206 --> 08:05.106
Oh!

08:05.108 --> 08:06.540
What are you doing?

08:06.542 --> 08:08.342
You scared the hell out of me!

08:08.344 --> 08:09.710
What are you doing?

08:09.712 --> 08:11.912
I've been sitting downstairs
for an hour and a half.

08:11.914 --> 08:15.082
How am I supposed to write with a wet head?

08:15.084 --> 08:16.383
You wouldn't have a wet head

08:16.385 --> 08:18.852
if you took a bath before I got over here.

08:18.854 --> 08:22.489
I woke up late. I haven't
been sleeping well.

08:22.491 --> 08:24.625
You know why? Because
you're always taking a nap

08:24.627 --> 08:25.926
while we're supposed to be writing.

08:25.928 --> 08:27.761
'Cause I haven't been
sleeping well at night.

08:27.763 --> 08:31.265
How many times you want
to circle this drain?

08:31.267 --> 08:34.768
- I just want to finish this book and be done with it.
- Oh.

08:34.770 --> 08:37.004
That reminds me, I need
to take another look

08:37.006 --> 08:39.139
at that barn fire in chapter five.

08:39.140 --> 08:40.707
It seems a little obvious.

08:40.708 --> 08:42.509
Maybe we should get that out of there.

08:42.510 --> 08:43.943
What are you talking about?

08:43.946 --> 08:45.646
I mean, that scene
affects everyone's lives.

08:45.648 --> 08:47.481
We'd have to rewrite half the book.

08:47.483 --> 08:50.150
Well, look who's afraid
of doing a little work.

08:50.152 --> 08:52.920
All I do is work while
you balance your checkbook,

08:52.922 --> 08:54.254
or change your sweater,

08:54.256 --> 08:56.490
or have an anxiety attack
because you found some old key

08:56.492 --> 08:58.358
and you don't know what lock it goes to.

08:58.360 --> 09:00.794
A key without a lock
opens the devil's door.

09:00.796 --> 09:02.863
Everyone knows that.

09:02.865 --> 09:05.031
Nobody knows that.

09:05.033 --> 09:06.933
'Cause you're a crazy old woman,

09:06.935 --> 09:09.903
and you're turning me into one, too.

09:09.905 --> 09:12.139
I see. I didn't realize working with me

09:12.141 --> 09:14.241
was such a hardship for you.

09:14.243 --> 09:15.642
Well, it is.

09:15.644 --> 09:17.210
You know, I'm losing my hair,

09:17.212 --> 09:18.578
and my gums are bleeding.

09:18.580 --> 09:21.314
Working with you is literally killing me.

09:21.316 --> 09:23.516
Fine. It'll be done by the end of the day.

09:23.518 --> 09:26.252
Now, if you'll excuse
me, I need to get changed.

09:26.254 --> 09:29.022
If you feel like you
need to humiliate me more,

09:29.024 --> 09:30.223
you're welcome to watch.

09:30.225 --> 09:32.559
You see that? Huh?

09:32.561 --> 09:34.160
That's blood,

09:34.162 --> 09:37.063
and that's on you.

09:49.298 --> 09:52.299
Mmm. I guess I should've just sat there,

09:52.301 --> 09:54.601
let her talk and not said a word.

09:54.603 --> 09:55.636
You'd think that.

09:55.638 --> 09:57.604
But you'd be wrong.

09:57.606 --> 09:59.306
We want you engaged.

09:59.308 --> 10:00.774
Like... like a back-and-forth?

10:00.776 --> 10:02.476
- Oh, no. No, no, no.
- Mm-mm.

10:03.912 --> 10:06.847
Nodding is good. Maybe an arm squeeze.

10:06.849 --> 10:09.216
You'd be amazed at all the
things you'd get squeezed

10:09.218 --> 10:11.552
with an "aw, sweetie."

10:12.654 --> 10:14.354
What the hell are you doing in here?

10:14.356 --> 10:16.156
You're missing a great game. Plus,

10:16.158 --> 10:18.225
the Zamboni ran over the mascot.

10:18.227 --> 10:21.561
There were feathers all over the ice.

10:21.563 --> 10:23.930
I'm just having a nice chat with the girls.

10:23.932 --> 10:26.633
On purpose?

10:26.635 --> 10:28.568
Yes, on purpose.

10:29.537 --> 10:31.605
Knock yourself out.

10:32.940 --> 10:34.508
JOYCE: Did you see that?

10:34.510 --> 10:35.942
Not even a hello.

10:35.944 --> 10:37.110
It's like we're invisible.

10:37.112 --> 10:39.479
- One little pat on the shoulder,
- Mm-hmm.

10:39.481 --> 10:41.248
he would have gotten some tonight.

10:41.250 --> 10:43.683
Now if he wants to have sex,

10:43.685 --> 10:46.086
he's gonna have to listen
to a 15-minute story

10:46.088 --> 10:49.189
about me returning some boots.

10:49.191 --> 10:52.792
- Poor, ignorant bastard.
- Mm-hmm.

10:55.463 --> 10:57.630
(typing rapidly)

11:02.470 --> 11:04.437
You... Would you like some tea?

11:04.439 --> 11:06.439
No.

11:10.344 --> 11:14.447
Boy, you've been typing
for two hours nonstop.

11:14.449 --> 11:17.083
You probably want to take a break and...

11:17.085 --> 11:18.551
I'm fine.

11:19.954 --> 11:22.922
Uh... Oh! How about that fire
in the barn in chapter five?

11:22.924 --> 11:25.024
You wanted to take a look at that.

11:25.026 --> 11:27.060
Let it burn.

11:28.796 --> 11:32.799
All right, listen, I am not
proud how I acted upstairs.

11:32.801 --> 11:34.834
I got into a fight with Mike this morning,

11:34.836 --> 11:36.035
and I brought it here.

11:36.037 --> 11:37.737
And it had nothing to do with you.

11:37.739 --> 11:39.338
I mean, tech... technically

11:39.340 --> 11:40.606
it was about you, but...

11:40.608 --> 11:42.642
really about Mike trying
to solve my problems.

11:42.644 --> 11:44.310
I mean, not that you're my problem.

11:44.312 --> 11:47.146
Wow, you really type fast.

11:48.448 --> 11:49.982
The end. Finished.

11:49.984 --> 11:51.984
Seriously?

11:51.986 --> 11:54.053
I put in that rolling-up-the-window thing.

11:54.055 --> 11:55.655
Oh, great. Yeah, I think...

11:55.657 --> 11:57.590
I'm tired. I'm going upstairs.

11:57.592 --> 12:00.493
Why? We just finished a book!

12:00.495 --> 12:01.861
I mean, we should celebrate.

12:01.863 --> 12:04.397
I know we don't have champagne,
but we should, you know,

12:04.399 --> 12:07.666
do shots of cough syrup or something.

12:07.668 --> 12:09.769
I bought us a bottle of champagne.

12:09.771 --> 12:10.870
It's in the crisper.

12:10.872 --> 12:12.004
Go ahead and take it with you.

12:12.006 --> 12:13.339
No. Peggy...

12:13.341 --> 12:15.207
You can see yourself out!

12:15.209 --> 12:18.377
Oh, come on. Don't do th...

12:19.679 --> 12:21.880
There go the gums.

12:25.018 --> 12:26.985
- What'd I miss?
- Two periods, three fights

12:26.987 --> 12:29.621
and a beer commercial that made Harry cry.

12:29.623 --> 12:33.392
Those horses just love that puppy.

12:33.394 --> 12:34.827
Where were you?

12:34.829 --> 12:36.662
I was just having a nice
talk with the ladies.

12:36.664 --> 12:38.263
On purpose?

12:38.265 --> 12:39.832
Yes, on purpose.

12:39.834 --> 12:42.201
But they had an appointment
they had to get to.

12:42.203 --> 12:44.036
- So the ladies left?
- Yeah.

12:44.038 --> 12:47.139
(passes gas)

12:47.974 --> 12:49.741
Seriously?

12:49.743 --> 12:52.511
Is it open season?
Because I have a rebuttal.

12:52.513 --> 12:54.513
No! No. No more.

12:54.515 --> 12:56.481
I want to enjoy my ribs.

12:57.750 --> 13:00.152
I'm sorry.

13:00.154 --> 13:01.086
What?

13:01.088 --> 13:03.989
- Oh! Oh!
- You know what?

13:03.991 --> 13:06.291
You guys disgust me.

13:06.293 --> 13:07.292
Where's my jacket?

13:07.294 --> 13:08.627
I think I'm sitting on it.

13:08.629 --> 13:10.028
(groans)

13:10.030 --> 13:12.631
Keep it!

13:13.466 --> 13:14.766
Talk about hypocrisy.

13:14.768 --> 13:17.669
I've seen that man make a coroner gag.

13:17.671 --> 13:20.171
Th... Wait a second. That's my jacket!

13:27.913 --> 13:30.715
MIKE: Oh, my God!

13:32.718 --> 13:35.887
Oh, this is the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.

13:35.889 --> 13:38.656
Wait till you get to the paraffin wax.

13:38.658 --> 13:41.826
I have no idea what the
hell that is, but I want it.

13:41.828 --> 13:44.362
Oh, I hope you don't mind
me crashing your party,

13:44.364 --> 13:46.798
but I just had to get out of there.

13:46.800 --> 13:47.765
We get it.

13:47.767 --> 13:49.300
Yeah, men can be such pigs.

13:49.302 --> 13:50.602
Right?

13:50.604 --> 13:53.204
You think I'll go back to
being like those animals?

13:53.206 --> 13:55.974
There's a good chance you
won't even remember this.

13:57.376 --> 14:00.278
Just enjoy the time we have left.

14:00.280 --> 14:03.881
I got to say it was fun hanging
out with you girls today.

14:03.883 --> 14:05.516
Anything else you can tell me

14:05.518 --> 14:08.753
before I return to the Planet of the Apes?

14:08.755 --> 14:10.388
Well, there's the classics:

14:10.390 --> 14:12.757
uh, dirty socks in the hamper,

14:12.759 --> 14:14.659
flowers for no reason...

14:14.661 --> 14:16.561
And take it easy down there.

14:16.563 --> 14:20.364
You're not a bear trying to
get honey from a tree stump.

14:23.035 --> 14:25.069
I don't know what that means.

14:25.071 --> 14:27.004
- Poor Molly.
- Mmm.

14:33.712 --> 14:36.380
What are you still doing here?

14:36.382 --> 14:38.949
Well...

14:38.951 --> 14:42.520
I was gonna split this
bottle of champagne with you,

14:42.522 --> 14:44.488
but then I started reading what you wrote,

14:44.490 --> 14:46.857
and I got so into it, I ended up splitting

14:46.859 --> 14:50.060
that bottle of champagne
with me. (Chuckles)

14:50.062 --> 14:51.762
(chuckling)

14:51.764 --> 14:53.397
You're soused.

14:53.399 --> 14:54.999
Oh! "Soused."

14:55.001 --> 14:56.767
That is such a good word.

14:56.769 --> 14:59.036
You know so many good words.

14:59.038 --> 15:03.474
You can't spell 'em for
crap, but you know them.

15:03.476 --> 15:04.942
I didn't come down to be insulted.

15:04.944 --> 15:06.410
I came down for my foot cream.

15:06.412 --> 15:09.046
(groans) I hate your feet.

15:09.048 --> 15:10.914
(snickering)

15:10.916 --> 15:12.382
Excuse me?

15:12.384 --> 15:14.318
They scare me.

15:14.320 --> 15:16.553
I think, if witches had feet,

15:16.555 --> 15:19.056
that they would look like your feet.

15:19.058 --> 15:20.757
(chuckles)

15:20.759 --> 15:22.659
Witches have feet.

15:22.661 --> 15:25.562
See? That's why... that's
why we're such a good team.

15:25.564 --> 15:27.731
'Cause I write stuff down

15:27.733 --> 15:32.235
and you tell me who has feet.

15:32.237 --> 15:33.437
We're not a team anymore.

15:33.439 --> 15:35.005
Book's done, and so are we.

15:35.007 --> 15:37.607
(singsongy): You're gonna miss me.

15:37.609 --> 15:42.404
(chuckling)

15:43.239 --> 15:45.107
What?

15:45.109 --> 15:47.776
I meant I'm gonna miss the work.

15:48.645 --> 15:50.579
That's not what you said.

15:50.581 --> 15:52.547
What do you want me to say,

15:52.549 --> 15:54.716
that I'm proud of what we've done?

15:54.718 --> 15:58.820
That you made me realize
a dream I never knew I had?

15:58.822 --> 16:03.725
That... I wish this wasn't gonna end?

16:04.560 --> 16:06.995
You put your witch hoof away,

16:06.997 --> 16:09.131
'cause I'm gonna hug you.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.301
Thank you.

16:13.303 --> 16:17.038
No. Thank you. You made me a better writer.

16:17.040 --> 16:19.708
Yeah, I know.

16:19.710 --> 16:20.976
(gasps)

16:20.978 --> 16:23.812
I'm gonna go get us that cough syrup.

16:23.814 --> 16:26.014
(chuckling)

16:35.451 --> 16:37.719
(door opens)

16:39.722 --> 16:41.890
Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

16:41.892 --> 16:43.525
What are you doing?

16:43.527 --> 16:46.695
(whispering): I don't want to wake you up.

16:48.397 --> 16:50.031
Well, I... I couldn't sleep

16:50.033 --> 16:52.767
because I... I feel really
bad about this morning.

16:52.769 --> 16:54.869
What? What happened this morning?

16:54.871 --> 16:56.971
- Hmm?
- Our fight.

16:56.973 --> 16:59.174
Oh, I had a lot of fights today.

16:59.176 --> 17:01.443
You're gonna have to be more specific.

17:01.445 --> 17:02.844
(chuckling)

17:02.846 --> 17:06.513
Well, the fight where I
stupidly tried to give you advice

17:06.516 --> 17:08.116
instead of listening.

17:08.117 --> 17:10.385
But I promise you, it's the
last time it's gonna happen.

17:10.387 --> 17:12.319
(gasps) Oh, my God.

17:12.321 --> 17:15.056
Your nails look gorgeous.

17:15.058 --> 17:17.125
- (chuckles)
- Mol... Molly.

17:17.127 --> 17:18.626
I'm trying to apologize here.

17:18.627 --> 17:20.595
- For what?
- For being a sucky husband.

17:20.597 --> 17:21.561
(gasps)

17:21.564 --> 17:24.065
Who called you that?

17:24.067 --> 17:26.634
You did.

17:26.636 --> 17:28.301
(giggling)

17:28.304 --> 17:30.805
You know, you should really not...

17:30.807 --> 17:32.807
listen to me so much.

17:32.809 --> 17:34.509
That's the point.

17:34.511 --> 17:36.677
I'm gonna start listening
to you more. Yeah.

17:36.679 --> 17:38.246
Today...

17:38.248 --> 17:39.714
I was with your mother and sister,

17:39.716 --> 17:41.215
and they... they really
gave me some insight

17:41.217 --> 17:42.717
on what it's like to try

17:42.719 --> 17:44.385
to express your feelings

17:44.387 --> 17:48.089
and your partner's not there for you.

17:48.924 --> 17:50.625
Molly?

17:50.627 --> 17:52.660
(snoring softly)

17:53.495 --> 17:55.563
Oh, this is not over.

17:55.565 --> 17:58.466
We're gonna talk about this in the morning.
