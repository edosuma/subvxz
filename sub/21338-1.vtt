01:14.875 --> 01:20.712
<i> Silas once told me war pushes</i>
<i> people in and out your life.</i>

01:20.747 --> 01:25.383
<i> But you better off</i>
<i> guessing on the wind</i>
<i> than tryin' to figure it.</i>

01:25.418 --> 01:28.087
<i> Truer words was never spoke.</i>

01:50.677 --> 01:54.913
<i> The hero part is later,</i>
<i> after the labeling part.</i>

01:54.948 --> 01:58.083
<i> In the moment,</i>
<i> it just be some cowering</i>

01:58.118 --> 02:01.186
<i> and some that choose</i>
<i> to throw their lives away.</i>

02:01.221 --> 02:08.193
<i> Later, maybe some of those</i>
<i> that threw their lives away,</i>
<i> they be the heroes.</i>

02:58.712 --> 03:01.880
<i> More than half</i>
<i> a million men was killed</i>

03:01.915 --> 03:05.350
<i> by snipers, small battles...</i>

03:07.420 --> 03:11.089
<i> ...and skirmishes</i>
<i> of just a few dozen men...</i>

03:13.093 --> 03:15.961
<i> ...made up about half</i>
<i> of all the killing.</i>

04:07.781 --> 04:11.916
I curse the ground
of this northern soil,

04:11.951 --> 04:15.220
and given the chance, I will not
touch this land again.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.796
Anything can happen here.

04:25.632 --> 04:29.434
We are abandoned by hope.

04:29.469 --> 04:33.004
<i> There be's misery,</i>
<i> and there be's misery</i>

04:33.039 --> 04:37.242
<i>that changes your life forever,</i>
<i> and puts you on a new path.</i>

04:37.277 --> 04:41.313
<i> That particular misery</i>
<i> was creeping in the woods</i>
<i> that night</i>

04:41.348 --> 04:44.015
<i> and it's what brung</i>
<i> them brothers,</i>

04:44.050 --> 04:46.785
<i> and all what they done</i>
<i> here to nightshade.</i>

05:20.687 --> 05:23.455
<i> Can you look at me?</i>

05:23.490 --> 05:26.558
You're awake. Are you all right?

05:27.394 --> 05:28.560
Can you look at me?

05:28.595 --> 05:29.994
Son, son, look at me.

05:30.029 --> 05:31.896
Look at me, come here.
Here.

05:31.931 --> 05:33.865
Can you look at me?

05:33.900 --> 05:34.966
Can you sit up?

05:35.001 --> 05:37.769
Come on, you can do it.
Sit up on me. Come on.

05:37.804 --> 05:39.771
There you go.

05:39.806 --> 05:43.842
You and your brother have been
unconscious for five days.

05:43.877 --> 05:47.079
Frankly, I'm surprised
you even survived.

05:47.881 --> 05:50.915
You have
a very serious infection.

05:50.950 --> 05:54.119
I have seen this, a half a dozen
times during the war.

05:54.154 --> 05:56.654
It's overwhelming
your body's defenses.

05:56.689 --> 06:01.459
Soon, even daylight
will make skin feel like
hot coals are on it.

06:01.494 --> 06:03.295
There's no medicine to help you.

06:06.332 --> 06:08.366
But... there is one thing.

06:08.401 --> 06:10.969
They're only rumors
that I've heard,
but they're very persistent.

06:11.004 --> 06:14.873
When you make
an offering to him,
by no means make it modest,

06:14.908 --> 06:19.043
but I think he's... he's the
only one who can help you.

06:19.078 --> 06:24.249
You have to go to Lazarus notch
and see the potion man.

06:25.585 --> 06:28.487
Now lay back down, easy, easy.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.223
That's good.

06:50.343 --> 06:53.011
<i> Cannibals.</i>

06:53.046 --> 06:56.614
<i> Word told it started in the</i>
<i> prison camps during the war.</i>

06:56.649 --> 07:01.052
<i> Some took to it to survive,</i>
<i> some didn't.</i>

07:01.087 --> 07:06.925
<i> But it gave them</i>
<i> strength, power, spread past</i>
<i> the walls of the camps.</i>

07:06.960 --> 07:11.463
<i>Now some was sheriff, deputies,</i>
<i> home guard, drifters...</i>

07:11.498 --> 07:12.831
We're the home guard, fellas.

07:12.866 --> 07:15.967
We need to see all of your
release papers, right now.

07:16.002 --> 07:18.536
<i> ...whatever they</i>
<i> wanted to be called,</i>

07:18.571 --> 07:20.071
<i> they was all just eaters.</i>

07:22.876 --> 07:24.342
Whoa.

07:24.377 --> 07:26.311
This is not our fight.

07:32.218 --> 07:36.054
<i> Like opium smokers,</i>
<i> they couldn't stop.</i>

07:36.990 --> 07:39.157
<i> They was addicted</i>
<i> to human flesh.</i>

07:47.367 --> 07:52.203
All right, then. I think...
I think that should
just about do it then.

07:52.238 --> 07:53.705
Poison.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.741
What?

07:56.776 --> 08:00.211
Poison... it's all that
spills from your lips, Stokes.

08:00.246 --> 08:03.281
- Poison and lies.
- Shut up, Lester.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.650
Things ain't perfect for no one.

08:05.685 --> 08:08.152
But the war is over,

08:08.187 --> 08:11.155
and if we're going to keep
things together here at
eye tooth hollow,

08:11.190 --> 08:15.960
it's best we
abide an understanding
with Royce and his nightwalkers.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.829
I don't got much use for them.

08:17.864 --> 08:19.764
Now, let's be clear.

08:19.799 --> 08:24.736
We're all in a world of trouble
if those negroes
up and clear off.

08:24.771 --> 08:31.342
This truce is critical for us
to have an abundant survival.

08:31.377 --> 08:35.078
And this truce is...
Is designed for one thing,
and one thing only,

08:35.114 --> 08:40.519
and that is to keep
our labor in place,
so as we all can be fed.

08:41.254 --> 08:42.754
Are we done?

08:45.258 --> 08:48.526
Well, mister, hurry-up,
why don't you just repeat,
back to me, the rules,

08:48.561 --> 08:52.463
so as we can be certain
there are no misunderstandings.

08:52.498 --> 08:55.133
Royce and his ghouls go first.

08:55.168 --> 08:58.870
Me and mine are left to their
cast offs and their leavin's.

08:59.672 --> 09:01.273
And?

09:02.442 --> 09:05.710
The only ones who what get took,
are the troublemakers,

09:05.745 --> 09:09.013
and lawbreakers or, generally,
any uppity niggrahs,

09:09.048 --> 09:14.352
or anybody what dares fall on
the mighty emperor's bad side.

09:15.588 --> 09:18.623
This truce between you,
your men...

09:19.726 --> 09:25.130
...and Royce and his people,
is the law.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.401
And more important than that...

09:30.970 --> 09:33.772
...you are accountable.

09:50.590 --> 09:55.026
Well, I thought
we might need them for cover.

09:55.061 --> 09:57.095
You were right.

09:59.799 --> 10:01.967
I'm sorry I was right.

10:18.885 --> 10:22.988
Hilde, I want you to have...

10:24.457 --> 10:29.527
Try... try not to talk, Jim,
save... save your strength.

10:49.148 --> 10:52.717
<i> How could they know</i>
<i>the horror, and river of blood,</i>

10:52.752 --> 10:55.120
<i> that would be</i>
<i> released by that deed?</i>

11:17.043 --> 11:19.010
Stick with the plan,
little brother.

11:19.045 --> 11:21.079
We've already put them
through enough.

11:21.114 --> 11:25.617
Seems like red hat and his men
are headed in the same direction
as we need to be going.

11:26.319 --> 11:27.852
We'll catch up.

11:30.890 --> 11:34.192
<i> The reason we got you</i>
<i> all out here in this breeze,</i>

11:34.227 --> 11:38.796
<i> is 'cause y'all is respected,</i>
<i> and can talk to the rest.</i>

11:38.831 --> 11:43.201
Mr. Lincoln says you
are all free to leave,

11:43.236 --> 11:45.503
go where you will.

11:48.307 --> 11:52.777
But he don't know that
we all depend on each other

11:52.812 --> 11:56.214
and understand each other
in this hollow.

11:56.249 --> 11:58.583
You can all shove on,
but when the cotton's grown

11:58.618 --> 12:01.219
and ready for pickin',
what will you have?

12:01.254 --> 12:04.956
Same thing we all have
right now... nothing!

12:04.991 --> 12:07.825
When you're out there
on the road...

12:07.860 --> 12:13.197
What harmin' bandits are waitin'
out there to prey on you.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.933
You... you've got to stay here.

12:15.968 --> 12:19.137
See... see through the season.

12:19.172 --> 12:23.508
Sheriff has heard of reports
that speak of cannibalism.

12:23.543 --> 12:29.280
Blood drained corpses
of unfortunate
and innocent travelers.

12:29.315 --> 12:34.753
We need each other
despite whatever
yankee laws are saying....

12:35.388 --> 12:37.055
...about freedom.

12:38.357 --> 12:41.926
<i> There we was,</i>
<i> and there they was,</i>

12:41.961 --> 12:44.262
<i> tryin' to tell us</i>
<i> to keep slaving for 'em</i>

12:44.297 --> 12:46.497
<i> like it was</i>
<i> brisket and biscuits.</i>

12:46.532 --> 12:48.499
<i> And they didn't even</i>
<i> crack a smile.</i>

12:48.534 --> 12:52.236
What about us croppin' cheap,
like peanut and hemp?

12:52.271 --> 12:56.741
- We make bigger coin wit' that.
- Eye tooth is cotton.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.280
Well, ain't y'all tired
a picking cotton
for Jimmy crack corn yet?

13:02.315 --> 13:04.282
- What did he say?
- - I'm telling y'all.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.784
We get a lil' piece a land,
a lil' piece,

13:06.819 --> 13:09.787
- we all throw in together.
- I don't believe this.

13:09.822 --> 13:13.124
- It's good dirt around here.
- This boy,
he just doesn't understand.

13:13.159 --> 13:14.525
We get one good bumper,
that all we need.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.361
We can build from there.

13:19.098 --> 13:21.432
Is you moonshine crazy!

13:21.467 --> 13:23.201
All flavor of spookies
runnin' round here,

13:23.236 --> 13:24.802
you tryin' to join
the Chuck wagon?

13:24.837 --> 13:27.238
Take your ass home
'fore they chop you up.

13:27.273 --> 13:28.940
I want you to take
care of that boy.

13:30.943 --> 13:32.744
Just do it quietly.

13:44.423 --> 13:46.123
Home guard, huh?

13:46.158 --> 13:49.594
Ain't y'all heard,
the war's over.

13:50.329 --> 13:54.332
You scream pretty,
real pretty.

14:44.951 --> 14:47.652
<i> Pray to god</i>
<i> if the brothers came for you.</i>

14:47.687 --> 14:51.822
<i> But god, don't listen</i>
<i> to no nonsense.</i>

15:15.948 --> 15:17.548
Two whiskeys.

15:21.053 --> 15:25.323
We're holding the paper
for a nightshade farm,
mister, here in eye tooth.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.091
Do you know who we can
talk to about selling it?

15:27.126 --> 15:29.394
Well, now, boys,
you can't sell that...

15:30.563 --> 15:32.063
...'cause I own it.

15:32.698 --> 15:34.565
Well...

15:34.600 --> 15:36.867
That doesn't bother me.

15:36.902 --> 15:41.839
You see we have plenty
of your type around here.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.208
And that paper's no good.

15:44.243 --> 15:48.245
No one will buy it from you,
'cause you don't own it.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.915
Our paper says different.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.251
And we done quit bosses
for good, mister.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.263
- Much obliged.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.064
'Neighbor.

16:07.099 --> 16:11.435
If you're interested in some
whore cabins, just east of here,

16:11.470 --> 16:12.837
they're clean and they're white.

16:12.872 --> 16:14.839
But ifin' you boys is hungry,

16:14.874 --> 16:18.242
there's some nigga whores
down in the holler,

16:18.277 --> 16:20.177
and you can do
what you want with them.

16:20.212 --> 16:23.180
You see we have ourselves
a truce here in eye tooth.

16:23.215 --> 16:27.084
Nightwalkers like you
will not touch any eater,

16:27.119 --> 16:30.088
and the eaters
won't touch you.

16:35.561 --> 16:41.999
You know, I hope them pantied
ladies at least as friendly

16:42.034 --> 16:44.869
as the welcoming committee
outside of town.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.057
Well, come on then.

17:06.092 --> 17:08.626
You ghouls ain't gonna be
the first ones to cross my path.

17:38.424 --> 17:40.124
Hey, why you lettin'
your horses go?

17:53.205 --> 17:56.874
Somebody's been
floodin' this land.

17:58.110 --> 18:00.845
These fields...
Covered with creek silt.

18:00.880 --> 18:06.317
This could be good land
but Stokes keep floodin' it
to help irrigate his own land.

18:06.352 --> 18:08.819
Right 'Cher yonder.

18:08.854 --> 18:10.554
What we going to do, hilde?

18:10.589 --> 18:12.189
We don't have nearly enough for
the potion man,

18:12.224 --> 18:15.659
we can't sell this,
and we don't have enough
for planting or labor.

18:15.694 --> 18:19.964
Look, the way I see it,
i could bandit for the money.

18:19.999 --> 18:22.833
- No...
- That feller in town, Stokes,
thinks he owns our land.

18:22.868 --> 18:24.835
Well, I could kill him,
take what he got.

18:24.870 --> 18:27.371
You know that'll 'cause
more problems for us
then it'll solve.

18:30.176 --> 18:31.876
Look, we wouldn't have
nearly enough time

18:31.911 --> 18:34.912
to sell the farm before we run.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.647
Then we'd just be
on the run with no money,

18:36.682 --> 18:38.048
instead of just having no money.

18:38.083 --> 18:39.683
Yeah, well, either way,
he ain't getting nightshade.

18:39.718 --> 18:43.154
This here farm
is our only chance.

18:44.623 --> 18:48.459
Come on, now,
you got another solution?

18:53.799 --> 18:54.999
Oh... oh...

18:55.034 --> 18:56.634
Looks like maybe the solution
to our problems

18:56.669 --> 18:58.469
been living rough right here.

18:58.504 --> 19:02.706
We're the charmington's.
My name is Beau,

19:02.741 --> 19:08.012
this here is my brother, hilde,
and this property is ours.

19:08.047 --> 19:11.482
I told you they didn't look
nothin' like Stokes' men.

19:11.517 --> 19:13.384
Stokes is done
lordin' over what ain't his.

19:13.419 --> 19:15.986
Hush up!

19:16.021 --> 19:18.756
If Stokes ain't dead,
he ain't done lordin'.

19:18.791 --> 19:21.259
Well, we got paper that say
different and so do the law.

19:24.029 --> 19:25.796
We ain't got nowhere else to go

19:25.831 --> 19:29.934
'cause them
free-work niggrahs...

19:29.969 --> 19:32.503
Made it where
an honest man can't work.

19:32.538 --> 19:37.508
We been tryin' to hold up
waitin' for Jim everette
to make it back,

19:37.543 --> 19:39.410
so we can work with him,

19:39.445 --> 19:43.247
help him get nightshade
up and croppin' again.

19:43.282 --> 19:44.215
What's your name squatter?

19:44.250 --> 19:46.784
My name's Ferris,
Ferris hoagland.

19:46.819 --> 19:50.754
And these here is my people,
even if it ain't by name.

19:50.789 --> 19:54.759
Well Ferris,
Jim everette is dead.

19:56.128 --> 19:57.628
Nightshade is ours now.

19:57.663 --> 20:01.232
Now, y'all can run off if you
want to, but come first rain,

20:01.267 --> 20:04.435
we fixin' to start croppin'
and make a go of it
here at nightshade.

20:04.470 --> 20:07.871
Now, we gonna need all
the money from the crop,

20:07.906 --> 20:09.974
but if you work
the land with us,

20:10.009 --> 20:13.010
we'll deed this farm over
to whoever done helped us.

20:13.045 --> 20:16.847
Are you sayin' we work
this season for free,

20:16.882 --> 20:18.282
then y'all gonna
give us the land?

20:18.317 --> 20:19.817
That's right.

20:19.852 --> 20:23.520
- We 'spose to believe that?
- We ain't croppin' with
no niggrahs!

20:23.555 --> 20:27.124
I ain't your boss, squatter,
but you don't like who I hire,

20:27.159 --> 20:32.029
you can take your chances
out on the roads or the woods
or in town.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.831
Or y'all can stay and work.

20:33.866 --> 20:36.400
We only plannin' on staying
this one season,

20:36.435 --> 20:38.569
then we going home
to our people.

20:38.604 --> 20:41.172
You work or leave.

20:42.975 --> 20:45.476
What y'all fixin' to crop?

20:45.511 --> 20:47.345
Hemp, peanut, tobacco.

20:48.180 --> 20:50.047
Whatever we can
afford the most of.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.383
Charmington's huh?

20:53.485 --> 20:55.886
Well, y'all definitely
ain't from around here.

21:32.324 --> 21:34.825
I need to order some supplies,
Mr. Jenkins.

21:34.860 --> 21:36.360
I got cash money.

21:36.395 --> 21:38.429
The charmington brothers
want to buy some hemp seed.

21:44.036 --> 21:46.003
Much obliged, sir.

21:55.147 --> 21:59.950
Sir, you still wantin' me
to take Stokes' order
out to his place?

22:14.867 --> 22:16.200
You's the most ignorant fool

22:16.235 --> 22:18.602
I've been displeasured
to ever know.

22:20.139 --> 22:22.473
I can't take your money, Silas.

22:22.508 --> 22:24.007
You better take
that money and ride on.

22:24.042 --> 22:26.577
Exactly what you think gone
come of you foolin' around

22:26.612 --> 22:28.112
with them nightwalker?

22:28.147 --> 22:29.813
Everybody want a
piece of you right now:

22:29.848 --> 22:35.219
Stokes, them plantation boys,
Lester hunt and the
rest of them eaters.

22:35.254 --> 22:37.187
If you want to live, boy,
you best to move on.

22:37.222 --> 22:40.090
I can't leave, Silas.
And I got me some land to crop.

22:40.125 --> 22:41.358
Land to... what?

22:41.393 --> 22:43.761
Boy, you been drinkin'
corn liquor from them jugs.

22:43.796 --> 22:46.997
- Move on, griff.
- It's for true, Silas.

22:47.032 --> 22:50.300
Now, them brothers,
they ain't got no money to pay,

22:50.335 --> 22:51.802
but they going to keep
the crop money

22:51.837 --> 22:53.938
and pay whoever crop with them,
with the land.

22:55.541 --> 22:57.541
And you fool enough
to believe them spookies?

23:00.412 --> 23:02.679
I need you to listen to me
on this here, Silas.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.782
Now, you ain't seen them
when they said it.

23:04.817 --> 23:07.918
Now, these spookies here
is... they's different.

23:07.953 --> 23:09.620
They's different than everybody.

23:09.655 --> 23:13.657
They's different, Silas,
and they paying with the land.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.994
Now, this here be's
our chance here, Silas.

23:17.029 --> 23:19.396
Now, we gonna have to share
the farm with those squatters

23:19.431 --> 23:22.399
and whoever crop with us,
but it's gonna be ours.

23:22.434 --> 23:24.234
Our land, Silas.

23:24.269 --> 23:27.705
You hearin' me, old man?
Our land.

23:29.041 --> 23:31.008
What's on the list of supply?

23:35.747 --> 23:38.949
How you figure to get that
there, with Jenkins how he is?

23:38.984 --> 23:41.351
No, we, we can't
get the seed from Jenkins,

23:41.386 --> 23:43.821
gotta go to bachelorville,
or lake Weir for that.

23:45.257 --> 23:47.658
About two weeks 'til first rain.

23:47.693 --> 23:51.195
But they should wait,
so Stokes don't get
no word of it.

23:51.230 --> 23:55.866
But I could get
everything else on here.

23:55.901 --> 23:58.169
And some of our people to work.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.777
We gone have us some land.

24:10.182 --> 24:11.949
Yeah, boy...

24:15.921 --> 24:18.789
We gone have us some land...

24:52.591 --> 24:56.093
You got some nerve
drawing down on me, niggrah.

24:57.362 --> 25:02.399
I was gonna field dress you
quick, with my ax.

25:02.434 --> 25:03.767
But, now...

25:03.802 --> 25:05.302
You let me pass,

25:05.337 --> 25:07.771
or I aim to kill
the first one of you Jimmy's

25:07.806 --> 25:09.139
that's bold enough to stop me.

26:26.985 --> 26:29.253
Would you look at this.

27:08.860 --> 27:11.161
I want to thank you all

27:11.196 --> 27:14.131
for coming to my
humble planters party.

27:14.166 --> 27:17.801
We have plenty
to rebuild something better.

27:18.837 --> 27:20.404
And, free or not,

27:20.439 --> 27:23.473
we don't have to worry about
our slaves leavin' us.

27:23.508 --> 27:27.110
Because they are deadly afraid
of Royce and Lester's men...

27:27.145 --> 27:29.079
Goddammit, Lester!

27:29.114 --> 27:32.649
Now, go ahead and play,
play something nice.

27:32.684 --> 27:36.253
I said play,
you malingering bastard.

27:36.288 --> 27:41.358
Now, folks, there's no need
for you to get upset about this,
we're all used to

27:41.393 --> 27:44.861
Lester and his boys
with a wild streak.

27:44.896 --> 27:48.131
We have, on the veranda,

27:48.166 --> 27:54.137
some spiced custard
and mint julep.

27:54.172 --> 27:58.909
Please, go this way, and I'll be
rejoining y'all, momentarily.

28:00.078 --> 28:01.779
Beautiful dress.

28:03.482 --> 28:08.151
I told you, did you not hear me,
that I would not abide

28:08.186 --> 28:11.188
you disrupting
these festivities?

28:11.223 --> 28:13.623
- Now...
- This goddamn ghoul

28:13.658 --> 28:17.461
- was moving funny...
- ...Take your boys and go.
Now!

28:17.496 --> 28:19.096
This ain't right.

28:19.131 --> 28:22.799
This ain't no kinda balance
a power like you talked about.

28:22.834 --> 28:25.702
Them ghouls is practically
running the show.

28:25.737 --> 28:27.804
We ain't on even ground
here with this thing.

28:27.839 --> 28:34.311
I have four fresh coloreds
waitin' out by the barn
for you boys.

28:34.346 --> 28:36.580
You can have your pick
of three of them.

28:36.615 --> 28:40.584
Mm-hm. We just getting
Royce's hand me downs.

28:40.619 --> 28:42.753
They ain't nearly
as fresh as you say.

28:42.788 --> 28:44.554
Hardly got no strength
left in 'em.

28:44.589 --> 28:45.989
They's fresh enough.

28:47.159 --> 28:49.193
Now, the barn, Lester.

28:51.029 --> 28:52.796
Come on, boys.

28:57.302 --> 29:01.772
Please... please accept
my deepest apologies.

29:02.941 --> 29:06.777
But you can't completely
blame Lester, now, can you?

29:07.879 --> 29:10.280
Those charmington boys,
they launched

29:10.315 --> 29:13.650
an unprovoked attack
on Lester and his men yesterday.

29:13.685 --> 29:17.187
Now, they may not be local,
but they must abide
by the rules.

29:19.524 --> 29:24.495
I expect those boys to be
punished appropriately.

31:17.008 --> 31:20.844
You just gotta get a feel
for it, the weight, the balance.

31:20.879 --> 31:24.348
You don't think about it,
know the blade will hit.

31:25.984 --> 31:28.919
Outta help the next time
you run out of bullets.

32:06.524 --> 32:08.125
All right, then.

32:23.575 --> 32:25.275
That's the spot.

32:26.144 --> 32:28.778
In the hollow of the neck.

32:28.813 --> 32:32.682
Use two hands,
you do not stop pressing.

32:32.717 --> 32:37.454
Your blade should be looking
for daylight on the other side.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.691
You're pretty good with that.

32:44.295 --> 32:46.096
Yeah, well, I had to work at it.

32:47.332 --> 32:48.832
You're a natural.

32:50.101 --> 32:51.735
Go on back now, I'll catch up.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.370
Yes, sir.

32:58.109 --> 33:01.979
Yeah... I had to work at it.

33:04.516 --> 33:08.352
It's pretty much all
I'm good for, is killing men...
And trees

33:12.724 --> 33:15.392
farther from home
with each and every one.

34:03.174 --> 34:06.843
Your dresses have been
particularly beautiful lately.

34:08.079 --> 34:10.746
Do you have a gentleman in mind?

34:18.755 --> 34:21.324
I noticed the men
gathered outside the stables,
daddy.

34:22.927 --> 34:25.328
Odd sort for honest man's work.

34:25.362 --> 34:28.364
I hire them sometimes.
Some on, some off.

34:29.266 --> 34:31.501
Just depends
on our needs is all.

34:31.536 --> 34:33.503
There are quite
a number of them.

34:35.672 --> 34:37.540
These new men wouldn't have
anything to do with the people

34:37.574 --> 34:39.876
- planting down on nightshade,
do they?
- Now, Philly...

34:39.911 --> 34:43.146
I just don't see the point
of pushing everyone off
Jim everette's place.

34:43.181 --> 34:48.551
The hard facts are that
we need to hold on
to everything that we've got.

34:48.585 --> 34:51.420
And that includes nightshade
and the flood grounds.

34:52.991 --> 34:54.290
You realize,
we are surrounded by

34:54.324 --> 34:56.426
thousands and thousands
of freed slaves?

34:56.460 --> 34:57.861
We're out-numbered nine-to-one.

34:57.896 --> 35:01.197
Now, what happens if they get
the notion for revenge?

35:01.232 --> 35:03.833
They're going to go after
what families first?

35:03.868 --> 35:08.171
- But, daddy, what if...
- Sweetie, there are
no what ifs.

35:08.206 --> 35:12.308
Daddy, your freed slaves
don't want any revenge.

35:12.343 --> 35:16.346
They just want to try to
find their families
and start some new kind of life,

35:16.381 --> 35:18.515
and these men you've hired
are not farm hands.

35:18.550 --> 35:21.184
This is not the time
for this discussion,

35:21.219 --> 35:23.686
'cause it's upsetting
my digestion.

35:23.721 --> 35:25.355
The war is finally over
and if we can just...

35:25.390 --> 35:27.023
No!

35:28.293 --> 35:29.559
No.

35:31.896 --> 35:33.697
Now...

35:35.733 --> 35:39.836
Sweetie, Jenkins promises me
that he'll have Silas

35:39.871 --> 35:43.773
run those dresses right up here
as soon as they arrive.

35:43.808 --> 35:46.776
I think I'm ready
for that chicken now.

35:50.515 --> 35:52.249
Thank you.

35:55.353 --> 35:56.720
Thank you, Henry.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.258
You are my very heart, Philly.

36:02.660 --> 36:04.394
My very heart,

36:04.429 --> 36:10.233
we must remain
together on all of this.

36:10.268 --> 36:13.937
Now, listen...
Listen, they'll be no more
of those late night walks.

36:13.972 --> 36:15.738
I want you to stay
close to daddy, now.

36:15.773 --> 36:20.510
And no more of those little
clandestine charity meetings.

36:20.545 --> 36:22.545
Please, put the silverware back.

36:22.580 --> 36:27.984
We'll soon
be without any eating utensils.

36:28.019 --> 36:33.022
If I cannot alter my fate,
as you say, daddy,
then what do utensils matter?

36:33.057 --> 36:35.892
Or anything else I may
choose to do with my time?

37:12.764 --> 37:16.165
Henry, please tell Marie

37:16.200 --> 37:21.571
that the chicken is
particularly excellent tonight.

37:38.790 --> 37:41.591
You look like you're still
ready for the war.

37:46.264 --> 37:47.730
For the squatters.

37:47.765 --> 37:50.099
My canning skills ain't
the best in eye tooth,

37:50.134 --> 37:53.736
but last season's berries
were the best in years.

37:53.771 --> 37:56.773
My name is Stokes.
Philomena Stokes.

37:58.109 --> 38:04.347
Of course... my name is
beauregard charmington.

38:05.383 --> 38:08.485
My brother hilde and I,
we own nightshade.

38:17.028 --> 38:19.863
You're a beautiful man,
aren't you?

38:21.466 --> 38:25.468
Do you have a nickname your
brother or family uses for you?

38:29.540 --> 38:31.041
Beau...

38:33.778 --> 38:34.944
Beau.

38:34.979 --> 38:37.847
Well, Beau... Beau,

38:39.550 --> 38:42.452
I'm going to
figure one out for myself.

38:42.487 --> 38:44.721
Welcome to eye tooth hollow,
Mr. charmington.

38:45.656 --> 38:47.324
Welcome to my home.

38:53.331 --> 38:54.931
You're welcome, Michael!

38:55.900 --> 38:58.301
You and miss philomena
gonna get married now?

39:42.713 --> 39:45.048
Hilde...
Hilde.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.817
<i> Hilde!</i>

40:42.373 --> 40:44.173
You know what, brother,

40:44.208 --> 40:49.378
you are not the god of sky
and light and steel and battle.

40:49.413 --> 40:51.781
Things was right lively
out there that day.

40:53.384 --> 40:55.952
And they took their chances,
same as us.

40:57.021 --> 40:58.955
I owe, hilde.

41:00.391 --> 41:06.762
Jim everette, at camp,
tried to help me, wound up dead.

41:06.797 --> 41:10.500
- Shit, you tried to help me,
you end up bit.

41:10.535 --> 41:13.803
Poisoned, with the blood fever,
just like me.

41:13.838 --> 41:16.773
Now, I owe, hilde.

41:17.842 --> 41:21.478
I owe and too many people
been payin' my bill.

41:23.748 --> 41:26.883
You're leaving out the part
where you done saved me.

41:49.473 --> 41:50.974
May we come in?

41:52.543 --> 41:53.776
Come on.

42:05.156 --> 42:09.091
So...
Where are we going with this?

42:09.126 --> 42:11.127
We're not going anywhere.

42:11.162 --> 42:14.130
Stokes believes that
he can control everything.

42:15.299 --> 42:20.870
Which is really, not unlike
a muskrat, lost and drowning

42:20.905 --> 42:25.074
in a mighty river,
while anointing himself
the river king.

42:26.077 --> 42:29.612
The two of you
are all that matters.

42:29.647 --> 42:32.582
I mean, the blood feud
with the eaters is nothing.

42:32.617 --> 42:35.451
They're so focused on the
short term gains of their

42:35.486 --> 42:39.923
digestive mistakes,
they're blind.

42:40.992 --> 42:42.792
Most of them can hardly
even speak anymore,

42:42.827 --> 42:46.395
and that only portends much
greater and irreversible changes

42:46.430 --> 42:49.065
if they don't alter their diet.

42:49.100 --> 42:50.666
We don't care
nothing about them.

42:50.701 --> 42:52.635
As well you shouldn't,

42:53.504 --> 42:55.404
in the end,
they're hardly a threat.

42:55.439 --> 42:58.942
- Just don't let them
mass up on you.
- You have a point?

43:01.145 --> 43:03.780
Stokes wants me
to kill you both.

43:05.783 --> 43:07.917
But I think that's a bad idea.

43:08.853 --> 43:11.220
And it would be a violation
of the truce.

43:11.255 --> 43:14.424
Not his, mind you, mine.

43:17.528 --> 43:20.596
I think you're far too valuable
to be treated as livestock.

43:20.631 --> 43:22.098
Get out.

43:25.636 --> 43:27.670
Just hear me out.

43:29.040 --> 43:33.175
The two of you are now... gods.

43:33.210 --> 43:35.978
But you still think
you're mortal.

43:36.013 --> 43:38.714
I mean,
you've been handed Olympus,

43:38.749 --> 43:42.251
and you want to toil the fields
as farm hands?

43:44.455 --> 43:47.790
But around you, all the land,

43:47.825 --> 43:51.060
and all the people,
all of this is ours.

43:53.330 --> 43:55.064
We want you to join us.

43:57.134 --> 43:59.369
You heard my brother.

44:01.405 --> 44:03.806
Now, did you
see that, gentlemen?

44:03.841 --> 44:07.209
I told you they had it in them.

44:07.244 --> 44:10.413
I'm gonna allow your little
commedia Dell'arte to play out.

44:10.448 --> 44:16.452
And in the fullness of time,
there will be clarity.

44:39.877 --> 44:44.280
Jasper, I found out
your mother was sold

44:44.315 --> 44:47.684
to the Robinson family
in cutlerville, Virginia.

44:48.986 --> 44:53.022
Bessie,
i haven't been able to find

44:53.057 --> 44:55.625
anything out about Herman
just yet,

44:56.594 --> 44:58.261
but I'm going to keep trying.

45:01.699 --> 45:03.066
Little Sarah...

45:08.973 --> 45:10.773
...I'm sorry...

45:13.110 --> 45:19.515
Your daddy died
three years ago, as a runaway.

45:22.353 --> 45:28.057
He was trying to get back here.
Trying to get back to you.

45:50.681 --> 45:51.914
Jasper...

45:54.218 --> 45:57.686
This is for you.
This is from my hope chest.

45:57.721 --> 46:00.556
I want you to use it
to get back to your mother.

46:04.628 --> 46:07.396
Go on, now, go on.

46:15.372 --> 46:16.639
Shh...

46:19.043 --> 46:20.576
You know, he's right.

46:21.779 --> 46:23.846
Y'all done for, boys.

46:53.611 --> 46:56.379
No... no, wait. Wait.

46:57.248 --> 46:59.348
Wait... it's not...

47:01.018 --> 47:02.852
It's not what it looks like.

47:06.590 --> 47:08.357
I'm sorry!

47:17.568 --> 47:21.571
Come on now, Beau,
let's get these bodies.

47:38.522 --> 47:42.892
<i> Do you want to feel</i>
<i> the sun on your skin again,</i>
<i> my child?</i>

47:51.702 --> 47:54.203
Now, make sure you get the
squatters and the new families

47:54.238 --> 47:56.705
working up on the east fields
by tomorrow morning.

47:56.740 --> 47:59.642
Then, tomorrow night,
me and Beau,

47:59.677 --> 48:01.410
will finish up
what they didn't get to.

48:01.445 --> 48:03.646
Yes, sir.

48:03.681 --> 48:05.548
That be 'bout the last field.

48:06.817 --> 48:09.352
We'll be ready for first rains.

48:12.723 --> 48:15.157
You know, I'm grateful
for what y'all doing here.

48:16.327 --> 48:18.928
Hell, I'm grateful
for every lil' thing.

48:18.963 --> 48:20.863
The war done took
most everything.

48:21.799 --> 48:23.833
That's what war do, mostly.

48:25.102 --> 48:30.273
But right here on the tail end
of that, there be's somethin'.

48:35.579 --> 48:40.716
I never much cared nothin' much
about... family and farming.

48:42.019 --> 48:45.054
And we was never rich enough
to own nobody.

48:46.590 --> 48:50.960
And, now, I'm grateful
for that mercy.

48:52.262 --> 48:54.964
You see, everything they told us
we was fightin' for...

48:56.233 --> 48:59.235
...we thought we was
fightin' for, that was a lie.

49:00.938 --> 49:04.206
Yeah, the men who started
this war, well...

49:04.241 --> 49:06.542
<i> ...they just as easily kill</i>
<i> a white soldier,</i>

49:06.577 --> 49:08.510
<i> as they do a black slave.</i>

49:08.545 --> 49:11.948
<i> Or a lame plough horse.</i>

49:15.853 --> 49:18.220
Yeah, we was nothin' to them.

49:27.831 --> 49:30.032
<i> You see,</i>
<i> the war funny like that.</i>

49:30.067 --> 49:35.137
How it be teachin'
and takin' all at once.

49:35.172 --> 49:37.673
I done learnt
a few things by it.

49:39.309 --> 49:41.477
Like what I'm 'spose
to do with this?

49:42.413 --> 49:44.246
What I'm 'spose to do
with freedom?

49:45.649 --> 49:48.317
That keep me up most nights.

49:49.920 --> 49:56.125
Since I come here to nightshade,
well, I sleep just fine.

49:56.160 --> 49:58.027
And so do the rest.

49:58.062 --> 49:59.562
You should know that.

50:01.331 --> 50:06.502
Now, if you find things
happen... or things change,

50:06.537 --> 50:08.771
your plans change,

50:08.806 --> 50:10.873
well, you should know
how these people

50:10.908 --> 50:12.775
have taken a shine to you.

50:12.810 --> 50:16.779
Well, you all will always be
welcome here.

50:17.648 --> 50:20.716
You know, if something changes.

50:34.998 --> 50:38.133
Well... goodnight, gentlemen.

50:41.205 --> 50:42.872
Goodnight griff.

51:01.024 --> 51:03.893
That mug made griff
a regular chatterbox.

51:06.029 --> 51:08.130
Vino veritas.

51:10.434 --> 51:11.834
What?

51:39.329 --> 51:41.597
Now, y'all
in violation of the law.

51:42.966 --> 51:46.702
Nightshade farm
and these woods is mine.

51:48.172 --> 51:53.775
I laid claim to it
openly and notoriously.

51:53.810 --> 51:55.944
If you persist
with this insurrection...

51:55.979 --> 51:59.782
...it will end up
in the fires of hell.

52:00.684 --> 52:03.652
Now, who shot at my pig?

52:03.687 --> 52:06.555
Who was shooting at my pig?

52:07.157 --> 52:08.724
Why you chasing my pig?

52:08.759 --> 52:12.427
We only feedin' our families.

52:12.462 --> 52:16.031
Thems wild hogs
don't belong to nobody.

52:16.066 --> 52:17.799
Hallelujah!

52:17.834 --> 52:23.338
I have found the reason for our
mutual misery and discontent.

52:23.373 --> 52:26.341
You see,
there's simple misunderstanding.

52:26.376 --> 52:30.179
I own all the pigs,

52:30.214 --> 52:34.316
and the possums,
and the rabbits,

52:34.351 --> 52:38.020
and the water,
and every blade of grass.

52:38.055 --> 52:41.657
As a matter of fact,
you're breathing my air,
without my permission.

52:41.692 --> 52:43.425
Collect their weapons.

52:48.465 --> 52:51.867
Nightshade has been the flood
plane of my ancestral home for
years,

52:51.902 --> 52:55.070
and what you're doing
is upsetting

52:55.105 --> 52:57.506
the Jewel of eye tooth,

52:58.475 --> 53:00.275
with your unsightly rabble.

53:04.381 --> 53:08.050
And this will be your
last and only warning.

53:12.723 --> 53:15.524
Our deed is legal and proper.

53:15.559 --> 53:19.128
Leave now, or we'll kill you.

53:19.930 --> 53:21.897
I don't think so.

53:21.932 --> 53:26.301
Why don't y'all come out
and model those bush robes
i heard about?

53:28.105 --> 53:32.775
So you think you going shoot us
all from your little hidey
holes in the trees?

53:41.852 --> 53:45.154
It looks like our bunny rabbits
have grown teeth now.

53:46.790 --> 53:48.324
All right, then.

53:49.760 --> 53:51.126
All right.

53:53.397 --> 53:55.297
But I will be back!

53:56.933 --> 53:58.467
We will be back.

54:05.275 --> 54:06.842
Clear!

54:08.211 --> 54:11.880
The very definition of,
"you shall show
to them no mercy."

54:17.721 --> 54:20.055
- Hilde...
- Double the patrols.

54:21.558 --> 54:23.959
This is all we got.

54:23.994 --> 54:25.861
Maybe our chance
is one in a thousand,

54:25.896 --> 54:27.562
hell, maybe a million.

54:27.597 --> 54:30.299
What if the doc was wrong
'bout the potion, man, huh?

54:30.334 --> 54:31.933
What if they're ain't
no cure for what we got?

54:31.968 --> 54:35.137
No, we... this our one chance.

54:35.172 --> 54:40.276
Our one chance to go back...
To what we was.

54:42.179 --> 54:43.679
We're going to make it back.

54:43.714 --> 54:46.515
We could just kill Stokes,
take he got.

54:46.550 --> 54:48.217
There'd be plenty
for the potion man then.

54:52.322 --> 54:55.357
Right, of course not.

54:55.392 --> 54:58.627
Your delicate constitution
won't permit us banditry.

55:00.897 --> 55:05.000
And nor yours,
prior to fighting confederate.

55:05.035 --> 55:06.835
That's your problem,
little brother,

55:06.870 --> 55:09.071
you think the war's over.

55:34.998 --> 55:36.632
What are you doing here?

55:49.880 --> 55:51.580
Are you afraid of me?

55:53.283 --> 55:54.783
I've seen many
nightwalkers in my life.

55:54.818 --> 55:56.752
That's not what I asked you.

55:58.288 --> 56:00.155
I am.

56:00.190 --> 56:04.093
You seem to be a very
violent man, Beau charmington.

56:11.768 --> 56:14.069
And, yet,
you do not try and escape.

56:18.375 --> 56:20.442
Perhaps you see something else.

56:25.248 --> 56:27.282
Perhaps you see who I really am.

59:35.005 --> 59:38.140
Shit! What in tarnation
you do that for!

59:42.946 --> 59:45.747
<i> I hope...</i>
<i> That them pantied ladies</i>

59:45.782 --> 59:49.818
are at least as friendly
as the welcoming committee
outside of town.

59:49.853 --> 59:52.354
These our men
went done gone missing.

59:58.728 --> 01:00:00.562
Go get everyone.

01:00:02.499 --> 01:00:04.099
Right now!

01:00:08.772 --> 01:00:11.340
You goddamned ghouls
gonna pay for this.

01:00:13.643 --> 01:00:15.611
First rain's a coming

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:18.613
and it's been two weeks

01:00:18.648 --> 01:00:21.883
since those boys
stole my property.

01:00:21.918 --> 01:00:23.785
And they're still on it.

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:27.055
They're still on it.

01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:30.659
And you have done absolutely
nothing to get them off.

01:00:30.694 --> 01:00:32.560
Absolutely nothing.

01:00:32.595 --> 01:00:36.498
- Well, I tried to bring them
into the fold...
- Into the fold!

01:00:36.533 --> 01:00:38.066
...but they're not
exactly ready yet.

01:00:38.101 --> 01:00:42.270
Into the fold!
Into the goddamned fold!

01:00:43.273 --> 01:00:45.173
Have another drink, filbert.

01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:48.543
It is what you do best lately.

01:00:48.578 --> 01:00:54.516
The misery of your inaction...
Makes a man want to imbibe.

01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:58.754
Royce...

01:01:01.191 --> 01:01:05.393
Royce, I'm giving you
'til sun up tomorrow

01:01:05.428 --> 01:01:08.229
to remove those boys
from my property.

01:01:08.264 --> 01:01:11.099
And that's your last chance.

01:01:12.368 --> 01:01:16.738
If you haven't done it by then,
i know someone be

01:01:16.773 --> 01:01:19.775
more than happy
to push them off.

01:01:59.215 --> 01:02:03.151
This is wrong, Lester.
Stokes is wrong.

01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:05.587
Go on and tell it
to the trees ghoul,

01:02:05.622 --> 01:02:07.589
I don't take orders from you.

01:02:07.624 --> 01:02:10.425
Stokes has got you out here,
attacking nightshade

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:13.328
and you mean to tell me it's
never even occurred to you

01:02:13.363 --> 01:02:18.867
that this is senseless,
not to mention dangerous.

01:02:20.203 --> 01:02:22.303
How many men of yours

01:02:22.338 --> 01:02:25.140
are you willing to sacrifice
out here tonight

01:02:25.175 --> 01:02:27.509
on the altar of Stokes' whim?

01:02:27.544 --> 01:02:34.349
If Stokes says it gets done,
its gonna get done.

01:02:36.653 --> 01:02:40.355
Stokes can't last like this,
Lester, and you know it.

01:02:41.224 --> 01:02:43.525
You can be the new Stokes.

01:02:55.371 --> 01:02:57.305
Let's move.

01:02:59.976 --> 01:03:03.779
Obviously, I've lowered myself
to the height of a fool.

01:03:20.597 --> 01:03:22.998
Nothing good
can come of it, brother.

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:26.268
Good already has.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.273
The day suits?

01:03:32.308 --> 01:03:33.508
No time.

01:04:09.245 --> 01:04:11.479
Get up! Get up!

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:13.415
Get up, you big son of a bitch!

01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:49.284
They sun poisoned.

01:04:49.319 --> 01:04:51.352
We gotta get 'em
to the sleeping boxes.

01:04:51.387 --> 01:04:52.654
- Come on.
- Come on, Beau.

01:04:52.689 --> 01:04:54.722
Come on, we got you.

01:04:54.757 --> 01:04:57.458
What the hell is
wrong with you boys, huh?!

01:04:57.493 --> 01:04:59.394
I mean, you just...
You...

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:02.864
All you're going to do
is get yourselves killed!

01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:07.402
Ain't nobody ever been good to
our family like you, Mr. hilde.

01:05:07.437 --> 01:05:09.437
Sorry I didn't stop that man.

01:05:09.472 --> 01:05:12.206
I was going to...
Or die tryin'.

01:05:12.241 --> 01:05:14.309
Sorry he weren't quicker with
the rifle, Mr. hilde.

01:05:25.555 --> 01:05:27.521
I got you, come on.

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:32.060
Come on, Mr. hilde.

01:05:39.068 --> 01:05:40.802
Come on, Beau.

01:05:55.118 --> 01:05:57.919
Niggers and squatters...

01:05:57.954 --> 01:06:00.889
On the grave of my granddaddy...

01:06:05.428 --> 01:06:07.796
...you will rue this day.

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:13.068
Death is too good for you.

01:06:18.908 --> 01:06:21.009
I'll give you
the money in these pockets,

01:06:21.044 --> 01:06:22.644
if you kill
that worthless ghoul.

01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:28.249
Go back to
your daughter, Mr. Stokes.

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:32.920
Say her name one more time.
Come on.

01:06:32.955 --> 01:06:34.756
Philomena.

01:06:34.791 --> 01:06:37.959
- Just say it one more time.
- My, my.

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:40.661
You are drunk, filbert.

01:06:40.696 --> 01:06:45.299
But I encourage you
to continue upon your
course of action.

01:06:45.334 --> 01:06:49.037
Some actions do have
consequences, however.

01:06:55.878 --> 01:07:02.717
I... never want you to say
the name of my flower... ever.

01:07:03.886 --> 01:07:05.253
Ever.

01:07:09.459 --> 01:07:15.797
Listen, those boys,
they're gonna start
planting come first rain.

01:07:15.832 --> 01:07:20.334
But I want you to
forget about that, you cowards,

01:07:20.369 --> 01:07:25.773
you groveling sniggering dogs...
...And just remember the fact,

01:07:25.808 --> 01:07:29.343
that those night walking freaks

01:07:29.378 --> 01:07:34.415
have hired our slaves
and are paying them with land.

01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:36.784
- Land?
- They're paying them with land.

01:07:36.819 --> 01:07:38.152
- With land.
- - No.

01:07:38.187 --> 01:07:42.123
And what other kind of acts,
grotesque acts of...

01:07:42.158 --> 01:07:44.792
And disgusting, vile...

01:07:44.827 --> 01:07:48.696
Why they... they're living
together with white people,

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:52.433
how many of those
white people are white women.

01:07:52.468 --> 01:07:55.470
- Women?
- Niggers and white women!

01:07:56.772 --> 01:08:01.843
Come on, now, this is our town.
We need to enforce

01:08:01.878 --> 01:08:05.980
whatever laws are necessary
or becomes necessary

01:08:06.015 --> 01:08:12.353
to uphold and support
our rights and traditions.

01:08:13.890 --> 01:08:16.858
And them nightshade brothers'
ain't eatin' those niggrahs

01:08:16.893 --> 01:08:20.461
from down in the bottom,
like we gots to.

01:08:20.496 --> 01:08:23.564
No, no, them two brothers
is eatin' us.

01:08:23.599 --> 01:08:25.765
Me and my men.

01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:28.002
They're huntin' us down
like pigs on truffles.

01:08:28.037 --> 01:08:29.970
Picking us off one at a time!

01:08:30.006 --> 01:08:35.376
Now, that is a violation
of the truce that we're 'spose
to have with the ghouls!

01:08:35.411 --> 01:08:36.911
You wait a minute, Lester...

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:41.149
And that niggrah, griff,
helping them to hunt us down!

01:08:42.785 --> 01:08:45.553
You're right, Lester.
You're right, and I agree.

01:08:45.587 --> 01:08:48.022
Now, it's up to you
to make a decision,

01:08:48.057 --> 01:08:50.658
you must decide on what side
you're going to be on.

01:08:50.693 --> 01:08:53.661
Or by god...

01:08:53.696 --> 01:08:56.197
Well, I'm not going
to fight against you,

01:08:56.232 --> 01:08:59.634
but you better pray
to whatever deity it is you got.

01:08:59.669 --> 01:09:03.371
Pray that the new blood's
wrath will be merciful,

01:09:04.173 --> 01:09:05.939
but I truly doubt it.

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:15.383
Lester, I want you to gather
up all of our friends.

01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:20.854
All those undead, goddammed...

01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:26.594
...eaters and deputize 'em all!

01:09:26.629 --> 01:09:30.631
Go find them in every county,
every place you find them,

01:09:30.666 --> 01:09:32.867
bring them in here
and deputize them.

01:09:32.902 --> 01:09:35.036
Well, it's about goddamn time!

01:09:36.072 --> 01:09:39.473
We will set... now for
a correction in nightshade

01:09:39.508 --> 01:09:41.008
of biblical proportions.

01:09:41.042 --> 01:09:44.111
We are about to scourge
eye tooth hollow

01:09:44.145 --> 01:09:48.716
of all those
race-mixin' niggers and ghouls

01:09:48.751 --> 01:09:50.984
for the very last time!

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:53.888
That's right!

01:09:53.923 --> 01:09:55.389
We must fight!

01:10:02.798 --> 01:10:07.502
We must fight
for our rights and traditions!

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:13.908
I'll be back from bachelorville
by tomorrow night
with the seed for planting.

01:10:13.943 --> 01:10:17.078
We'll get the seed in the ground
before first rain.

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:22.917
There are two of us, you know?

01:10:22.952 --> 01:10:24.919
I always told mama
you could count.

01:10:25.688 --> 01:10:27.021
I want to go with you.

01:10:28.324 --> 01:10:30.324
Griff can't
protect nightshade alone.

01:10:30.359 --> 01:10:32.627
I'll be fine,
just mind the store for a day.

01:10:32.662 --> 01:10:35.062
It'll be safe
for a few days, at least.

01:10:35.097 --> 01:10:38.332
Stokes is gonna need time
to build up more men.

01:10:38.367 --> 01:10:42.670
That'll be at least three days,
i expect.

01:10:42.705 --> 01:10:46.207
It's now or never, if going
to make a go of our harvest.

01:10:51.847 --> 01:10:53.848
You and griff will be okay.

01:10:55.885 --> 01:10:57.986
I'll be back in one night.

01:11:05.995 --> 01:11:08.462
That girl's making you soft.
Now, come on, now,

01:11:08.497 --> 01:11:10.398
don't get all womanly on me.

01:11:14.236 --> 01:11:15.470
Brother...

01:11:18.207 --> 01:11:20.808
I will not
say this to you again.

01:11:21.610 --> 01:11:23.010
You're tender-hearted.

01:11:23.045 --> 01:11:25.313
You talk too much
and do too much.

01:11:25.348 --> 01:11:27.548
Like you got something to prove.

01:11:29.452 --> 01:11:32.253
You are also the finest man
I've ever known my whole life

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:34.455
and I envy you,
your Mercury heart.

01:11:36.025 --> 01:11:38.826
You got nothing to prove, Beau.

01:11:38.861 --> 01:11:41.629
For whoever cannot see these
obvious and wonderful qualities

01:11:41.664 --> 01:11:46.467
in you, is not worth the letters
and breath to dissuade.

01:11:48.237 --> 01:11:52.874
And I cannot imagine the station
at which I find myself,
without you by my side.

01:12:15.664 --> 01:12:17.632
You a bear, Beau.

01:12:18.234 --> 01:12:20.335
You a goddamned grizzly.

01:12:20.836 --> 01:12:22.370
Hiya!

01:12:42.725 --> 01:12:45.226
I want you both on
the eastern field tonight.

01:12:45.261 --> 01:12:47.395
I'll take the Meadow with Beau.

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:14.188
Mr. Jenkins say you
want to see me, Mr. hunt.

01:13:15.524 --> 01:13:18.325
Yes, we do, Silas.

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:20.361
Yes, we do.

01:13:20.396 --> 01:13:23.097
- Have a seat.
- Yes, sir.

01:13:30.506 --> 01:13:31.906
Have a drink.

01:13:32.274 --> 01:13:33.508
Yes, sir.

01:13:43.786 --> 01:13:44.919
Daddy!

01:13:44.954 --> 01:13:47.088
Daddy, where are you?

01:14:13.682 --> 01:14:15.049
No...

01:14:42.611 --> 01:14:44.945
Philomena! Hey...
Philomena!

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:46.013
Shh, shh...

01:14:47.116 --> 01:14:49.884
Hey, tell me what's happening.

01:14:49.919 --> 01:14:53.087
- Hey, hey, what's wrong?

01:14:53.122 --> 01:14:55.222
What happened?
What happened?

01:14:55.257 --> 01:14:59.660
It's just...
It's this whole place, Beau.

01:14:59.695 --> 01:15:03.064
It's eye tooth itself.
There is no love here.

01:15:04.133 --> 01:15:08.836
- Shh...
- Except with you at nightshade.

01:15:11.774 --> 01:15:15.075
Tell me about what you're
going to do when you leave here.

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:16.410
Tell me about your family.

01:15:16.445 --> 01:15:18.846
As soon the crop comes in,
we're gonna have enough money,

01:15:18.881 --> 01:15:20.714
we are going
to go see the potion man.

01:15:20.749 --> 01:15:22.683
All right, we are gonna...

01:15:22.718 --> 01:15:25.853
We're gonna be human, again.

01:15:27.323 --> 01:15:29.223
We're gonna go home.

01:15:31.694 --> 01:15:34.929
- Why can't you go home now?
- Because I...

01:15:34.964 --> 01:15:37.698
- Before things get worse.
- 'Cause I ain't exactly right.

01:15:37.733 --> 01:15:40.935
All right, I don't know what
i am, but I am not what I was.

01:15:42.571 --> 01:15:44.638
You're fine just how you are.

01:15:44.673 --> 01:15:46.741
Shh...

01:15:47.576 --> 01:15:49.109
Well, there's my brother, too.

01:15:49.144 --> 01:15:52.547
I ain't never heard of
a nightwalker making that
transition back, not ever.

01:15:54.850 --> 01:15:56.617
We aim to try.

01:15:59.588 --> 01:16:01.522
What is this, Beau?

01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:09.196
It's my family.

01:16:15.671 --> 01:16:18.572
My family's gone, Beau.

01:16:18.607 --> 01:16:20.441
I'm all alone.

01:16:20.476 --> 01:16:23.244
No... hey...

01:16:25.381 --> 01:16:29.116
You are never alone
as long as your family is near.

01:16:52.374 --> 01:16:57.178
Yessum, I believe today
is the day of first rains.

01:18:06.482 --> 01:18:08.315
Too many of them for us alone.

01:18:09.084 --> 01:18:10.184
Hilde must have been wrong

01:18:10.219 --> 01:18:11.985
about them
gatherin' men so quick.

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:14.988
Hold them off long as you can.

01:18:15.023 --> 01:18:16.857
I'm going to go get Beau.

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:38.813
Run!

01:18:41.250 --> 01:18:42.383
To Silas...

01:18:43.685 --> 01:18:46.353
For conveying the proper message
to our negroes.

01:18:49.258 --> 01:18:50.624
Whiskey.

01:18:59.434 --> 01:19:02.169
Goddammit, Lester, what the
hell happened this morning?

01:19:04.807 --> 01:19:08.809
We did what you said,
we poisoned the ground.

01:19:10.512 --> 01:19:14.348
All high ground,
you got all the crops?

01:19:14.383 --> 01:19:16.984
- All of them?
- Yes, sir, we did.

01:19:17.019 --> 01:19:20.521
Twenty large bags
of lime and... acid.

01:19:24.359 --> 01:19:27.795
I want a raise, goddammit!

01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:31.098
What y'all have promised us,
ain't nearly enough
for this madness.

01:19:31.133 --> 01:19:33.768
Sure, sure, you earned it.

01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:38.605
It was like them ghouls
knew we was coming.

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:42.576
One of 'em got loose
in that... that robe a his,

01:19:42.611 --> 01:19:46.446
and killed us or run us off
who weren't already killed.

01:19:46.481 --> 01:19:48.682
Now, where's the rest
of your deputies?

01:19:49.818 --> 01:19:51.819
Are you not listening?

01:19:51.854 --> 01:19:53.187
They're dead!

01:19:53.222 --> 01:19:56.423
The whole thing went sideways
out there, all of it!

01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:58.992
So, those charmington boys,
they just run you all off?

01:19:59.027 --> 01:20:02.896
Uh, no, it weren't but one them
in that bushy suit a his.

01:20:02.931 --> 01:20:05.232
And those goddamned squatters
did their part, too,

01:20:05.267 --> 01:20:08.535
and that niggrah, griff.

01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:12.006
Less than a dozen a us survived,
prolly less than half a dozen.

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:17.578
So how many of those others
were killed besides your men?

01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:20.747
You weren't there, Stokes,

01:20:20.782 --> 01:20:22.616
you don't know
what we was dealing with!

01:20:23.619 --> 01:20:24.818
Even your goddamned daughter

01:20:24.853 --> 01:20:26.720
showed up in that crazy mix.

01:20:26.755 --> 01:20:29.590
If you have harmed a hair
on my little Philly's head...

01:20:29.625 --> 01:20:33.060
Quit your threats, Stokes.
She wasn't supposed to be there.

01:20:33.095 --> 01:20:35.963
The new men
thought she was a squatter.

01:20:35.998 --> 01:20:38.833
We done lost five men
getting her!

01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:44.171
You fiends!

01:20:44.206 --> 01:20:46.640
There weren't but
no other way to bring her.

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:50.244
She was like a bag
of angry cats.

01:20:56.351 --> 01:20:58.318
You have doomed us!

01:20:58.353 --> 01:21:00.120
You have doomed us all!

01:21:00.155 --> 01:21:02.556
These me are going to
take you home now, Philly.

01:21:03.825 --> 01:21:06.126
I am my father's daughter!

01:21:06.161 --> 01:21:09.663
And by my birthright, I am
doomed with the rest of you!

01:21:15.137 --> 01:21:18.239
There will be a reckoning
for all that we have done!

01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:23.810
There will be a reckoning
for all that we have done!

01:21:23.845 --> 01:21:26.313
There will be a reckoning!

01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:29.850
No!

01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:34.554
You men...
Just get her home!

01:21:34.589 --> 01:21:36.790
There will be a reckoning!

01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:40.661
There will be a reckoning!

01:21:41.263 --> 01:21:43.430
Reckoning!

01:21:43.465 --> 01:21:45.465
Where's the other brother,
Lester?

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:47.901
I have no earthly idea.

01:21:47.936 --> 01:21:51.071
I want you to ride to every
burg and briar patch you can,

01:21:51.106 --> 01:21:55.709
find every man with a firearm
and have them here tonight,

01:21:55.744 --> 01:21:57.744
have them here by the town hall,

01:21:57.779 --> 01:22:03.116
tell them I will pay $100
and five acres of land.

01:22:03.151 --> 01:22:05.786
We're going to
end this thing tonight.

01:22:05.821 --> 01:22:08.322
One night's work.
That's all, now, get.

01:22:08.357 --> 01:22:09.623
Come on.

01:22:17.132 --> 01:22:19.333
I want you men to get down
to Jenkins store

01:22:19.368 --> 01:22:20.567
and get all the wood
you can get.

01:22:21.970 --> 01:22:26.240
We're going to secure the hall
for our families.

01:22:26.975 --> 01:22:28.075
Now go.

01:23:20.562 --> 01:23:23.063
My mama's dead, griff.

01:23:25.333 --> 01:23:27.134
She got killed.

01:23:33.642 --> 01:23:35.876
Can't find David.

01:23:44.586 --> 01:23:46.319
I gotta go warn Silas.

01:23:46.354 --> 01:23:48.121
They might be
coming for him, too.

01:23:48.156 --> 01:23:50.824
- I want to go with you.
- Find your brother.

01:23:51.626 --> 01:23:53.327
I'll be back in a spell.

01:23:54.062 --> 01:23:55.229
Go.

01:26:00.422 --> 01:26:03.423
Beau was off with
miss philomena for a spell,

01:26:04.192 --> 01:26:07.027
<i> and when they came to attack,</i>

01:26:07.062 --> 01:26:10.130
<i> I went off to fetch him</i>
<i> so we could stand together.</i>

01:26:10.165 --> 01:26:12.232
I wouldn't let them
mass up on you.

01:26:43.031 --> 01:26:45.065
Where is she?

01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:48.769
The few what we didn't kill,
they done took off with her.

01:26:49.404 --> 01:26:51.471
She went with them?

01:26:51.506 --> 01:26:54.741
Not like that,
she was kicking and screaming.

01:26:56.244 --> 01:26:57.844
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:26:58.747 --> 01:27:01.248
They poisoned
high field with lime.

01:27:01.283 --> 01:27:03.883
<i> The rains done already washed</i>
<i> it across the whole farm.</i>

01:27:03.918 --> 01:27:07.754
There won't be nothing
growing here at nightshade
this season.

01:27:08.823 --> 01:27:14.127
And... they killed Ferris.
And Silas, too.

01:27:14.162 --> 01:27:16.697
Left him hanging out there
in the middle of the town.

01:27:23.371 --> 01:27:26.640
I'm sorry
for your troubles, griff.

01:27:27.208 --> 01:27:28.875
You a good man.

01:27:30.945 --> 01:27:33.413
We know you and Beau
needed this here money...

01:27:34.149 --> 01:27:35.916
...so we all throwed in.

01:27:40.922 --> 01:27:44.558
It only 'bout $75,
but it all the moneys we got.

01:27:47.495 --> 01:27:48.995
You still gots to see
the potion man

01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:50.998
so you could go home
to your peoples.

01:27:52.701 --> 01:27:54.768
That's some good seed stock.

01:27:54.803 --> 01:27:57.037
Y'all keep it 'til next season,

01:27:57.072 --> 01:27:59.606
clean up the bad
top soil from the rows,

01:27:59.641 --> 01:28:03.510
plough it under and come next
season, you'll be good to grow.

01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:07.280
Y'all are now the owners
of nightshade.

01:28:07.315 --> 01:28:10.350
Well, they just gonna run us off
soon as you leave, Mr. hilde.

01:28:10.385 --> 01:28:12.585
How we gonna stay
and make a go of it?

01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:15.322
You can stay, griff...

01:28:16.524 --> 01:28:18.825
...'cause y'all going to be
the only ones left.

01:28:29.137 --> 01:28:31.872
'Cause I'm gonna to kill
anything bigger
than a yardstick.

01:30:01.463 --> 01:30:03.830
It's mine! It's mine!

01:30:09.971 --> 01:30:12.339
I curse the day you were born,

01:30:14.642 --> 01:30:16.376
you motherless cur!

01:30:16.411 --> 01:30:19.212
I curse you through
the afterlife!

01:30:19.247 --> 01:30:21.981
May you rot in hell!

01:30:35.096 --> 01:30:36.763
My god...

01:30:48.142 --> 01:30:49.642
And I'm just gettin' started!

01:31:01.823 --> 01:31:03.490
Kill him!

01:31:09.964 --> 01:31:11.431
Get in there!

01:31:13.167 --> 01:31:14.534
Get him out of there!

01:31:27.849 --> 01:31:29.082
Get him out!

01:31:37.425 --> 01:31:38.725
Get in there!

01:32:42.957 --> 01:32:47.994
That's right, ghoul, we got him.
We killed your soulless brother.

01:32:48.029 --> 01:32:49.929
And you ain't
no goddamned different.

01:32:49.964 --> 01:32:52.098
We gonna kill you, too.

01:34:27.562 --> 01:34:30.497
I told Stokes it was
a bad idea to go this way.

01:34:34.435 --> 01:34:38.404
You don't know nothing of your
new nature, do you, hildebrant?

01:34:38.439 --> 01:34:41.574
What happens when it's been
too long since we've fed?

01:34:41.609 --> 01:34:43.943
We start to become handsome,
beautiful.

01:34:43.978 --> 01:34:46.612
Exquisite, irresistible.

01:34:46.647 --> 01:34:50.683
The hungrier we get, the more
beautiful we become to them.

01:34:50.718 --> 01:34:53.486
That's an evolutionary
development.

01:34:53.521 --> 01:34:57.156
It allows us to
predate more effectively.

01:34:57.191 --> 01:35:01.060
Join us, hilde.
Let us show you our world.

01:35:01.095 --> 01:35:04.764
You don't have to hide,
you don't have to be alone.

01:35:07.301 --> 01:35:10.069
Not that it matters,
because I'm going to
kill you all.

01:35:13.174 --> 01:35:15.475
Which one of you
fed on Silas?

01:35:15.510 --> 01:35:17.043
Waste not, want not.

01:35:37.799 --> 01:35:39.466
<i> Hilde!</i>

01:35:41.769 --> 01:35:43.069
<i> Hilde!</i>

01:35:43.104 --> 01:35:46.539
<i> You can have this</i>
<i> little spit of land,</i>

01:35:46.574 --> 01:35:49.642
<i> but I will see you again.</i>

01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:36.583
You want to feel the sun
on your skin again?

01:37:39.887 --> 01:37:41.421
Yes, sir.

01:37:43.791 --> 01:37:45.825
Do you want to be human?

01:37:47.395 --> 01:37:49.262
Yes, sir, I do.

01:37:49.297 --> 01:37:52.365
Do you have an offering for me?

01:37:54.035 --> 01:37:55.768
Yes, sir. Right here.

01:37:57.772 --> 01:37:59.305
Come in.
