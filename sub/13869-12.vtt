WEBVTT

00:01.468 --> 00:04.471
Previously on Zoo...
We have to find a saber-toothed cat.

00:04.505 --> 00:07.808
There's a rumor that we can find
one on an island called Pangaea.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.243
She just collapsed.

00:09.277 --> 00:10.778
I should've known. Known what?

00:10.811 --> 00:12.380
That she's pregnant.

00:12.413 --> 00:12.980
Any idea

00:13.013 --> 00:14.482
who the father is? Yes.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.117
Quite a good idea.

00:16.149 --> 00:18.419
You were working for
Davies the whole time!

00:18.452 --> 00:21.155
You made the same choice that I made...
that you're gonna survive

00:21.189 --> 00:23.124
in this new world,
whatever it takes.

00:23.157 --> 00:25.093
(silenced gunshot) Good
luck opening your chute.

00:27.395 --> 00:30.364
Why does Davies think that
you have the TX gas formula?

00:30.398 --> 00:32.566
Because I created the TX gas.

00:32.600 --> 00:35.336
PSA NARRATOR: Scientists have
been collecting DNA samples.

00:35.369 --> 00:39.507
Every species on Earth will be
recreated from this healthy DNA.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.376
Killing the animals?
Play God and repopulate the planet?

00:42.410 --> 00:43.644
This is ridiculous.

00:43.677 --> 00:46.114
I'm taking you to meet my
friends, the Shepherds,

00:46.147 --> 00:48.549
who live on the
island of Pangaea.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.389
â™ª

01:06.400 --> 01:08.436
Welcome to Sierra One.

01:08.469 --> 01:10.171
Nerve center of Pangaea.

01:10.204 --> 01:12.773
From the air,
you have no idea any of this is here.

01:12.806 --> 01:15.376
Yeah, that's the idea.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.644
You okay, son?

01:16.677 --> 01:18.879
Why'd you bring us here?

01:18.912 --> 01:22.183
To get the saber-toothed cat,

01:22.216 --> 01:24.218
complete your cure
and save the animals.

01:24.252 --> 01:28.122
Yeah, you gave Davies the
formula for the TX gas.

01:28.156 --> 01:30.158
That gas will kill
all the animals.

01:30.191 --> 01:31.425
And over two million people.

01:31.459 --> 01:33.294
Not if we do what
we came here to do.

01:33.327 --> 01:35.329
And what is that exactly?
You've told us nothing.

01:35.363 --> 01:37.274
What is this place?
What have you been doing here?

01:37.298 --> 01:39.267
The same thing you and
your team have been doing.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.734
Trying to save the world.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.803
Dr. Nielsen. My son,

01:42.836 --> 01:44.205
Jackson.

01:44.238 --> 01:45.606
His teammates,

01:45.639 --> 01:47.675
Dariela Marzan,

01:47.708 --> 01:49.677
Abraham Kenyatta.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.145
It's a pleasure to meet you all.

01:51.179 --> 01:52.489
We've been following
your progress.

01:52.513 --> 01:54.882
I understand your apprehension.

01:54.915 --> 01:56.617
Explanations are in order.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.886
If you'll follow me?

02:03.457 --> 02:05.759
Pangaea was established
in the mid-19th century

02:05.793 --> 02:07.728
by a consortium of scientists,

02:07.761 --> 02:10.531
the Shepherds,
who feared human progress

02:10.564 --> 02:13.201
would one day be the
undoing of our planet.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.435
So this is where

02:14.468 --> 02:16.437
you've been since you
died two years ago?

02:16.470 --> 02:18.706
Yeah. Working with the
other Shepherd scientists

02:18.739 --> 02:20.140
to stop the animal mutation.

02:20.174 --> 02:23.511
Well, if that's true, how did you
end up with the Noah Objective?

02:23.544 --> 02:24.578
We placed him there.

02:24.612 --> 02:26.480
It was the only way
to control Davies.

02:26.514 --> 02:27.615
"Control Davies."

02:28.649 --> 02:30.594
Davies has everything that
he needs to move forward

02:30.618 --> 02:32.753
with the Noah Objective
because of this guy.

02:32.786 --> 02:36.257
That was the only way to save
you and your team's work.

02:36.290 --> 02:38.192
How do you even know
what we've been doing?

02:38.226 --> 02:40.594
We've had our eye on
Dr. Morgan for quite a while.

02:40.628 --> 02:42.339
When the two of you
started working together,

02:42.363 --> 02:44.332
well, we expected great things.

02:44.365 --> 02:46.300
Then you know he should be here.

02:46.334 --> 02:48.769
We're trying to locate him and
Jamie Campbell as we speak.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.971
SOLDIER: Clear!

02:51.004 --> 02:52.440
Move it!

02:52.473 --> 02:54.775
(distorted voices
speaking indistinctly)

03:06.387 --> 03:09.657
Decoy convoy just left.
We know we're gonna get hit.

03:09.690 --> 03:12.426
So once we step through that
door, we are weapons-free.

03:12.460 --> 03:13.861
SOLDIERS: Sir, yes, sir!

03:13.894 --> 03:15.796
We are less than 12 hours away

03:15.829 --> 03:17.665
from the release
of the TX-14 gas.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.467
The start of the Noah Objective.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.503
After TX-14 has wiped
out the mutated animals,

03:22.536 --> 03:24.305
the DNA in this crate

03:24.338 --> 03:27.808
will repopulate the world with
clean, healthy animals.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.344
So, right now,

03:30.378 --> 03:32.613
this is the most
important cargo on Earth.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.587
Safeties off!

03:39.620 --> 03:40.788
SOLDIER: Let's go.

03:40.821 --> 03:41.855
SOLDIER 2: All right.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.776
(whispering): Shouldn't this stuff
be in Fort Knox or something?

03:52.800 --> 03:54.435
It was.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.937
There have already been
three attempts to steal it.

03:56.970 --> 04:00.674
So this is the...
backup to the backup to the backup?

04:00.708 --> 04:02.476
Yeah.

04:02.510 --> 04:04.778
With all that moving around,
at least we have a chance.

04:04.812 --> 04:06.914
But stealing this
DNA is our last shot

04:06.947 --> 04:08.482
at stopping the Noah Objective.

04:08.516 --> 04:10.518
Come on.

04:13.521 --> 04:16.290
(radio crackling)

04:19.627 --> 04:22.296
What's that smell?
It's like cotton candy.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.800
Cover your mouth and nose.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.569
It's halothane.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.003
Knockout gas.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.640
Whoever's chasing the
DNA is still here.

04:34.675 --> 04:37.345
(radio crackles)

04:39.347 --> 04:42.516
(coughing, wheezing)

04:50.491 --> 04:51.725
There it is.

04:51.759 --> 04:52.860
Let's take it and go.

04:54.895 --> 04:55.963
Drop your weapon.

05:01.602 --> 05:02.670
Logan?

05:02.703 --> 05:04.505
Hello, Jamie.

05:06.407 --> 05:09.610
â™ª

05:37.938 --> 05:40.774
ROBERT: The best thing you
can do for Mitch and Jamie

05:40.808 --> 05:42.075
is to work with us

05:42.109 --> 05:43.511
to prepare the cure.

05:43.544 --> 05:45.112
Now, even if Mitch's
protocols work,

05:45.145 --> 05:47.815
we haven't finalized a
way to distribute it.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.417
But we have.

05:49.450 --> 05:53.153
This... is our aviary.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.756
We've developed a
genetically enhanced strain

05:55.789 --> 05:57.458
of the avian flu.

05:57.491 --> 05:58.592
The perfect vector.

05:58.626 --> 06:00.394
But instead of
disease, this virus

06:00.428 --> 06:02.630
will be carrying your cure,

06:02.663 --> 06:03.797
which...

06:03.831 --> 06:07.435
40,000 birds will deliver
into the animal population.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.571
Birds? Yes. Birds.

06:10.604 --> 06:11.939
DARIELA: There's just one thing.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.407
We still need

06:13.441 --> 06:14.808
a live DNA sample

06:14.842 --> 06:16.043
from a saber-toothed cat.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.579
And that's where I come in.

06:20.448 --> 06:21.214
Who are you?

06:21.248 --> 06:22.950
This is Reece. Head of security.

06:22.983 --> 06:25.085
Knows the island better
than anybody else.

06:25.118 --> 06:27.488
The saber-tooths
are in Quadrant Six.

06:27.521 --> 06:29.198
But knowing where they
are and how to find one

06:29.222 --> 06:30.958
in the open so we
can collect a sample:

06:30.991 --> 06:32.793
two very different things.

06:32.826 --> 06:35.529
Well, we have experience
tracking animals.

06:35.563 --> 06:36.764
Not like these.

06:36.797 --> 06:38.566
They're reclusive, secretive.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.668
I've lived on this
island for half my life,

06:40.701 --> 06:42.936
and I've only seen
one in the wild.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.137
What if we lure them out?

06:44.171 --> 06:45.138
Sure.

06:45.172 --> 06:47.541
But it's not like we
can tie a side of beef

06:47.575 --> 06:48.709
to a tree and just wait.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.111
I'm the only side
of beef you need.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.446
Excuse me?

06:52.480 --> 06:53.380
I'm pregnant.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.749
The animals are drawn to me.
She's right.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.117
Absolutely not. Abe.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.887
What are you proposing?

06:59.920 --> 07:03.624
This could endanger your life
and the life of our child.

07:03.657 --> 07:04.958
It's the only way.

07:04.992 --> 07:07.160
If we don't get this
sample, there is no cure,

07:07.194 --> 07:10.598
and there won't be a world
left to raise our child in.

07:10.631 --> 07:14.034
Besides,
I'm a better shot than you anyway.

07:15.202 --> 07:16.537
(weapon fires)

07:24.144 --> 07:25.746
Dude...

07:25.779 --> 07:27.481
I'm wearing Kevlar.

07:27.515 --> 07:29.192
(alarm blaring) (over P.A.):
Attention, all personnel...

07:29.216 --> 07:30.784
Not on your face.

07:30.818 --> 07:32.620
There is a breach in Zone Eight.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.525
We have a breach in Zone Eight.

07:37.558 --> 07:38.659
Jamie, get in the truck.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.528
(alarm continues blaring)

07:41.662 --> 07:43.497
It's too heavy.

07:43.531 --> 07:45.371
You're not getting out
of here without my help.

07:46.033 --> 07:48.035
(over P.A.): Attention,
all personnel,

07:48.068 --> 07:50.237
there is a breach in Zone Eight.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.841
How are you here?
I watched you fall.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.876
(grunting): Yeah.
Out of the back of a plane

07:55.909 --> 07:57.778
with a tranq dart in my chest.
(grunts)

07:57.811 --> 07:58.879
Thanks for that.

08:00.981 --> 08:01.915
We got to go.

08:01.949 --> 08:02.950
Lucky for me my altimeter

08:02.983 --> 08:04.084
deployed my chute.

08:08.822 --> 08:09.657
(engine starts)

08:09.690 --> 08:10.791
You in?

08:10.824 --> 08:11.824
Yeah.

08:15.696 --> 08:18.799
(siren blaring)

08:19.833 --> 08:20.934
(tires screech)

08:24.572 --> 08:26.940
Freeze! Don't move!

08:27.841 --> 08:29.877
(indistinct chatter)

08:31.244 --> 08:32.780
Step out of the truck!

08:32.813 --> 08:35.716
(indistinct radio chatter)

08:41.822 --> 08:44.091
Step out of the truck now!

08:51.264 --> 08:53.133
I'm gonna buy us some time.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.935
Make it count.

08:56.604 --> 08:57.905
Mitch!

09:02.375 --> 09:03.944
Mitch Morgan.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.913
Why am I not surprised?

09:05.946 --> 09:07.280
Only you would be
arrogant enough

09:07.314 --> 09:09.783
to doom the entire planet
by stealing that DNA

09:09.817 --> 09:11.284
just because your
cure didn't work.

09:11.318 --> 09:13.020
Well, I got news for you.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.656
You've failed again.

09:15.689 --> 09:16.757
Not yet.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.158
We rigged up a little something

09:18.191 --> 09:19.927
in the back of the truck.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.563
My thumb comes
off this button...

09:26.233 --> 09:29.036
I'd back up if I were you.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.672
No. Absolutely not.
I need this DNA.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.907
Why? So you can sell it?
Do you even have a soul?

09:33.941 --> 09:35.919
I don't need one after the
check for this job clears.

09:35.943 --> 09:38.879
If Davies gets ahold of this
DNA, it is over!

09:38.912 --> 09:39.947
We need to destroy it.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.219
You're killing me right now.

09:47.354 --> 09:48.922
What are you doing?

09:48.956 --> 09:51.892
According to you...
the right thing.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.994
I know you, Morgan...
You're a coward.

09:54.027 --> 09:57.698
Cowards don't fight,
cowards don't sacrifice.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.967
Cowards bluff.

10:01.134 --> 10:02.803
And then they get shot.

10:02.836 --> 10:06.073
Well, apparently,
you haven't been paying attention.

10:07.741 --> 10:10.778
Because if you think that
after all we've been through,

10:10.811 --> 10:12.145
after all we've lost,

10:12.179 --> 10:15.615
that I'm not willing
to die to stop you...

10:16.850 --> 10:18.118
you're wrong.

10:20.988 --> 10:23.824
It's a little trick
I learned from a guy.

10:23.857 --> 10:26.393
As the lace unwinds,
it slowly undoes the knot,

10:26.426 --> 10:27.360
which releases...
I don't care how

10:27.394 --> 10:29.296
it works; just tell
me what it's gonna do.

10:29.329 --> 10:31.131
It's a delayed fuse.

10:31.164 --> 10:33.033
How much time do we have?

10:33.066 --> 10:35.102
20 seconds.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.436
Well, you may have the gall,

10:36.469 --> 10:37.838
but you don't have the means.

10:37.871 --> 10:38.972
He's bluffing; take him.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.173
Secure the cargo.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.711
20 seconds? I think.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.117
What is this, a laser pointer?

10:50.150 --> 10:51.752
How pathetically appropriate.

10:52.419 --> 10:53.386
He called my bluff.

10:53.420 --> 10:54.755
Wasn't a bluff.

11:03.764 --> 11:06.867
DAVIES: You just killed
the Noah Objective.

11:14.908 --> 11:15.919
(birds singing,
insects trilling)

11:15.943 --> 11:17.410
REECE: Well, this is a first.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.847
In the heart of the
saber-tooth's hunting ground,

11:19.880 --> 11:21.782
walking around with
a pregnant woman

11:21.815 --> 11:24.217
who's supposed to be like
catnip for the big cats and, uh,

11:24.251 --> 11:26.053
oh, yeah, no live rounds.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.855
We need a live sample.

11:27.888 --> 11:30.457
She sure doesn't make things
easy, does she?

11:30.490 --> 11:32.459
Never.

11:32.492 --> 11:34.070
You guys know those
tranqs you're carrying

11:34.094 --> 11:35.462
won't slow 'em down, right?

11:35.495 --> 11:36.463
Not even a little bit.

11:36.496 --> 11:37.965
Don't worry about us.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.399
Just focus on getting
those samples.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.935
Oh, Lucy and I got this.

11:41.969 --> 11:43.737
You named your crossbow.

11:43.771 --> 11:45.472
That's quirky.

11:45.505 --> 11:48.308
Yeah, she's custom-designed
for sample retrieval.

11:48.341 --> 11:49.810
Nonlethal, of course.

11:49.843 --> 11:50.878
Plus, she looks cool,

11:50.911 --> 11:53.080
I even wrapped her stock
up like a hockey stick.

11:55.548 --> 11:58.085
When you spend all year
sweating your ass off

11:58.118 --> 12:00.954
in the jungle,
the ice starts to look pretty appealing.

12:00.988 --> 12:03.023
The birds.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.092
They've stopped calling.

12:05.125 --> 12:07.260
We must be getting close.

12:07.294 --> 12:09.229
Or they must be
getting close to us.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.298
You notice any
environmental anomalies?

12:13.000 --> 12:13.967
No.

12:14.001 --> 12:15.535
What are you guys talking about?

12:15.568 --> 12:17.838
The other Triple-Helix animals

12:17.871 --> 12:20.073
all affected the environment.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.843
Earthquakes, acid rain, ice.

12:22.876 --> 12:25.112
So you're wondering what
the big cats do, right?

12:25.145 --> 12:26.513
Yes.

12:26.546 --> 12:28.281
Well, you're standing on it.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.951
When Leonard Pierce and the
Shepherd founders first arrived,

12:30.984 --> 12:32.986
this island was barely
200 square miles.

12:33.020 --> 12:36.857
Now, it's 20 times that size,
thanks to the saber-tooths.

12:36.890 --> 12:39.192
How is that possible?

12:39.226 --> 12:40.527
You should ask Dr. Nielsen.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.262
All I know is that
every couple months,

12:42.295 --> 12:43.572
there are underwater
volcanic eruptions

12:43.596 --> 12:44.564
around the island

12:44.597 --> 12:46.366
and when the lava flow cools...

12:46.399 --> 12:48.401
more beachfront property.

12:49.569 --> 12:51.504
(growling)

12:51.538 --> 12:53.006
What was that?

12:53.040 --> 12:55.375
(low growling)

12:57.444 --> 12:59.146
What's wrong?

13:02.983 --> 13:06.153
We're not tracking this cat.

13:06.186 --> 13:08.188
It's tracking us.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.221
Get 'em!

13:15.929 --> 13:18.298
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

13:18.331 --> 13:20.333
Pretty sure we just ruined
your little genocide.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.836
You just destroyed
humanity's last hope.

13:22.870 --> 13:24.404
JAMIE: Now you
have no choice but

13:24.437 --> 13:26.206
to try and cure the animals.

13:30.343 --> 13:33.113
Sir, what do you
want to do with them?

13:36.283 --> 13:38.285
Secure them for transport.
Yes, sir.

13:47.895 --> 13:49.396
General.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.401
I never thought it
would end this way.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.503
The Noah Objective, a failure.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.606
Sir?

13:59.639 --> 14:02.209
We have to abort the mission.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.444
You said it yourself.

14:04.477 --> 14:06.079
The Noah Objective
is the only solution.

14:06.113 --> 14:07.614
You can't just surrender.

14:07.647 --> 14:10.550
Sergeant, we are not gonna
kill all of the world's animals

14:10.583 --> 14:12.886
if there's no hope of
ever bringing them back.

14:12.920 --> 14:15.155
But, sir... It's over, son.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.991
Time to go home.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.228
This is General Davies.
I'm requesting

14:21.261 --> 14:24.064
a secure channel to the Noah
Objective command center.

14:24.097 --> 14:26.599
My clearance code is
Foxtrot, Tango,

14:26.633 --> 14:28.535
Lima, Six, Delta,

14:28.568 --> 14:31.104
Three, Three, Niner.

14:31.138 --> 14:32.639
Command, this is Alpha...

14:32.672 --> 14:33.907
(crack)

14:39.712 --> 14:41.514
Noah Objective is a go.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.953
Repeat, Noah Objective is a go.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.936
You and Davies have a nice cry?

15:02.970 --> 15:04.304
Shut up.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.408
You gonna kill us?

15:08.441 --> 15:09.943
I said shut up!

15:12.079 --> 15:13.446
Oh, my God.

15:16.516 --> 15:20.187
There's a car wash on the corner
of Lincoln and 223rd Street.

15:20.220 --> 15:21.188
I'll meet you there.

15:21.221 --> 15:23.190
I'm taking you to your friends.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.159
Who are you?

15:26.193 --> 15:27.570
Someone who wants to
see the world back

15:27.594 --> 15:28.637
to how it's supposed to be.

15:28.661 --> 15:30.630
What about Davies?

15:30.663 --> 15:32.432
What about the Noah Objective?

15:32.465 --> 15:34.034
I'll take care of it.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.935
Now go before Davies comes back.

15:56.523 --> 15:59.492
Well, Mitch is not gonna
be happy about this.

15:59.526 --> 16:01.428
No, he'll be fine.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.597
Especially if we complete
the genomic fossil serum.

16:04.631 --> 16:09.369
Isn't this all, um,
too little, too late, Dad?

16:09.402 --> 16:12.139
I mean, you gave Davies
the TX gas formula.

16:12.172 --> 16:16.543
He has the combined air forces
of the IADG to distribute it.

16:16.576 --> 16:17.544
And we have birds.

16:17.577 --> 16:20.047
It will take them time
to manufacture the gas.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.482
And at the drop
zone, it will take

16:22.515 --> 16:25.485
at least 12 hours
to take effect.

16:25.518 --> 16:29.156
Which means that we
not only have a chance,

16:29.189 --> 16:32.125
we might actually
have an advantage.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.727
But I can't do it without you.

16:34.761 --> 16:38.465
You really, uh,
enjoy being the underdog, don't you?

16:38.498 --> 16:41.234
"Against all odds, a hero

16:41.268 --> 16:43.103
"still makes it home

16:43.136 --> 16:45.272
in time for supper."
Your mother used

16:45.305 --> 16:49.209
to tell me that whenever the
pot roast was getting cold.

16:49.242 --> 16:50.510
Now,

16:50.543 --> 16:54.281
if these calculations
are correct,

16:54.314 --> 16:57.117
the serum will not only
eliminate the mutation

16:57.150 --> 17:01.121
from your DNA and create
a by-product in your blood

17:01.154 --> 17:04.057
that will allow us
to cure the animals.

17:04.090 --> 17:05.625
No pressure.

17:11.664 --> 17:14.166
You're gonna do great, son.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.077
You used to...

17:24.111 --> 17:26.246
do that before my track meets.

17:26.279 --> 17:28.448
Pat me on the back of the neck.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.320
I loved to watch you run.

17:33.353 --> 17:36.656
You always started so damn fast.

17:36.689 --> 17:39.159
It was like a lion
was chasing you.

17:39.192 --> 17:41.428
Made me feel like you
were out there with me,

17:41.461 --> 17:43.430
pushing me to run faster.

17:43.463 --> 17:46.299
So I was a lion?

17:46.333 --> 17:48.301
Yeah.

17:48.335 --> 17:51.171
Yeah, I guess so.

17:51.204 --> 17:52.705
Well, today

17:52.739 --> 17:54.741
I am not leaving your side.

17:54.774 --> 17:56.809
We're doing this.

17:56.843 --> 17:59.746
Together.

18:01.681 --> 18:04.217
(birds chirping)

18:05.252 --> 18:07.754
(electrical humming)

18:10.757 --> 18:12.425
What is this?

18:12.459 --> 18:14.627
That is Section K.

18:14.661 --> 18:15.762
What's Section K?

18:15.795 --> 18:17.330
Let's just say not
all our experiments

18:17.364 --> 18:19.299
go according to plan.
And when they don't,

18:19.332 --> 18:22.235
they end up in there.
But nothing gets through that fence.

18:22.269 --> 18:24.371
It'll protect our flank
from the saber-tooth.

18:24.404 --> 18:25.672
(roaring)

18:25.705 --> 18:28.808
Abe... I know what
you are going to say,

18:28.841 --> 18:30.610
that you don't want me
to protect you. Yes.

18:30.643 --> 18:31.883
But I'm going to anyway. (roars)

18:31.911 --> 18:33.546
Look out! (growling)

18:34.547 --> 18:36.516
(grunting)

18:36.549 --> 18:38.285
Reece!

18:38.318 --> 18:39.719
Reece, shoot it!

18:39.752 --> 18:41.488
Come on, Reece!

18:41.521 --> 18:43.656
(snarling, yowls)

18:43.690 --> 18:44.624
Back of the net!

18:44.657 --> 18:46.859
(growling)

18:46.893 --> 18:48.861
(screams)

18:49.796 --> 18:50.797
Reece!

18:50.830 --> 18:52.399
(roaring)

18:52.432 --> 18:53.700
(Reece screaming)

18:55.935 --> 18:57.770
Reece! Reece, where are you?

18:57.804 --> 19:00.340
(growling) (Reece screaming)

19:01.674 --> 19:02.609
Reece!

19:02.642 --> 19:04.777
(snarling) Reece!

19:06.646 --> 19:08.748
(growling)

19:08.781 --> 19:10.883
(screaming)

19:10.917 --> 19:12.452
(screams)

19:28.968 --> 19:32.539
Another man down on
the way to the cure.

19:36.309 --> 19:38.811
We have the final
piece to the puzzle.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.718
Now let's go finish this.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.903
Did you prep that sloth sample?

20:03.936 --> 20:06.706
Right here.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.675
Thank you.

20:13.813 --> 20:14.981
What is it?

20:15.014 --> 20:18.751
It's nice to see you doing good
work in the lab again, Dad.

20:18.785 --> 20:22.489
It's a relief to be able to do
my work in the open, finally.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.023
With you.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.259
No secrets.

20:27.694 --> 20:30.330
And into the
centrifuge with you.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.732
(chime) TROTTER: Abe and
Dariela are on their way back.

20:32.765 --> 20:35.001
They have the
saber-toothed cat DNA.

20:35.034 --> 20:37.270
(chuckles) We'll be ready.

20:37.304 --> 20:38.538
(beep)

20:38.571 --> 20:40.673
Why Dr. Morgan made the
protocol so complicated

20:40.707 --> 20:43.410
is beyond me.
I know a simpler way to prep

20:43.443 --> 20:45.412
the DNA from the saber-tooth.

20:45.445 --> 20:46.879
Please don't do that.

20:46.913 --> 20:49.449
Took me hours of trial and error
to get that protocol right.

20:50.517 --> 20:52.685
It's about time
you guys showed up.

20:52.719 --> 20:53.820
Come here.

20:53.853 --> 20:55.422
(grunts)

20:59.326 --> 21:00.693
Logan.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.995
Mansdale, you brought
one of Davies' men here?

21:03.029 --> 21:04.731
Considering we just destroyed

21:04.764 --> 21:06.733
the Noah Objective's
supply of clean DNA,

21:06.766 --> 21:09.436
I'm pretty sure I'm off of
Davies' Christmas card list.

21:09.469 --> 21:10.303
You did what?

21:10.337 --> 21:11.804
It's gone. We blew it up.

21:11.838 --> 21:14.307
No clean DNA, no Noah Objective.

21:14.341 --> 21:15.575
That's unbelievable.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.085
Well, what's unbelievable
is that we, uh,

21:17.109 --> 21:19.346
intercepted him
trying to steal it.

21:19.379 --> 21:21.748
Nobody's perfect.

21:21.781 --> 21:22.882
He's a liability.

21:27.019 --> 21:28.588
Oh, don't look at me.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.022
I don't even know
your real name.

21:30.056 --> 21:31.991
And frankly, I don't care.

21:32.024 --> 21:33.793
Do what you want with him.
Jamie.

21:33.826 --> 21:34.794
You heard her.

21:34.827 --> 21:37.764
I don't want him anywhere
near the compound.

21:37.797 --> 21:38.798
You understand me?

21:38.831 --> 21:40.800
Yes, sir.

21:40.833 --> 21:41.868
Jamie.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.772
Jamie!

21:45.805 --> 21:48.508
Dr. Morgan, it's an honor.

21:48.541 --> 21:51.711
The work you've done
here is exemplary.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.613
Thanks.

21:53.646 --> 21:54.690
Looks like you've been busy.

21:54.714 --> 21:59.619
Yes...
but now the real work can begin.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.490
I followed your
protocol to the letter.

22:03.523 --> 22:04.967
Then why aren't we
seeing any reaction?

22:04.991 --> 22:06.493
I don't know.
Maybe there are problems

22:06.526 --> 22:07.636
with the protocol.
The protocol's fine.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.896
Hey.
What the hell's going on here?

22:09.929 --> 22:11.731
Ask your dear ol' dad.

22:11.764 --> 22:13.566
Your DNA is not interacting

22:13.600 --> 22:14.910
with the serum the
way we need it to.

22:14.934 --> 22:16.536
I'm telling you,
something has changed.

22:16.569 --> 22:17.804
And if it wasn't the protocol

22:17.837 --> 22:19.439
or the DNA or the genomic

22:19.472 --> 22:21.340
fo...

22:26.713 --> 22:27.714
What-what is that?

22:27.747 --> 22:28.827
It's nothing. It's, yeah...

22:30.583 --> 22:32.695
My dad has me on a medication
to control the symptoms.

22:32.719 --> 22:34.854
It's obviously time
for the next dose.

22:36.423 --> 22:37.424
What medication?

22:37.457 --> 22:40.026
The badger acid.

22:40.059 --> 22:42.862
It's interfering with the serum.

22:44.497 --> 22:46.074
How long is it gonna
take to clear his system?

22:46.098 --> 22:47.434
36 hours?

22:47.467 --> 22:48.568
What? No.

22:48.601 --> 22:49.878
We-we don't have
that kind of time.

22:49.902 --> 22:50.770
But you said that

22:50.803 --> 22:51.904
the Noah Objective planes

22:51.938 --> 22:53.649
are grounded,
so we're not fighting against a clock.

22:53.673 --> 22:55.050
Yeah, but the animals
don't know that.

22:55.074 --> 22:56.609
The mutation could change...

22:56.643 --> 22:57.953
(snaps fingers)
again in 36 hours,

22:57.977 --> 22:59.011
so our window is now.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.047
No more medication

23:01.080 --> 23:02.415
until we figure this out.

23:02.449 --> 23:03.583
But without it,

23:03.616 --> 23:06.486
the symptoms of the mutation
will come back, unabated.

23:07.487 --> 23:09.055
I can handle it.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.624
But can we handle you?

23:14.494 --> 23:16.128
I'll talk to Dr. Nielsen.

23:16.162 --> 23:18.097
I'll see if there are
any other drug candidates

23:18.130 --> 23:19.799
that may help
mitigate the symptoms.

23:38.818 --> 23:40.820
(breathing heavily)

23:43.923 --> 23:45.033
How are they doing in there?

23:45.057 --> 23:47.426
They're working as
fast as they can.

23:50.563 --> 23:52.799
How are you?

23:52.832 --> 23:55.134
I feel like, uh...

23:55.167 --> 23:56.669
there's a dam inside me

23:56.703 --> 23:59.572
about to crack wide open...

23:59.606 --> 24:01.708
and there's nothing
I can do to stop it.

24:03.710 --> 24:07.079
Mitch, your father,
and the Shepherds...

24:07.113 --> 24:08.681
they're working on a solution.

24:08.715 --> 24:09.749
I don't know, Abe.

24:09.782 --> 24:11.250
Even if they do figure it out,

24:11.283 --> 24:12.619
there's no guarantee

24:12.652 --> 24:13.720
that the serum will work.

24:13.753 --> 24:14.420
It will work.

24:14.453 --> 24:15.664
Yeah, well, what if it doesn't?

24:15.688 --> 24:16.656
Jackson...

24:16.689 --> 24:17.724
Abe, listen to me.

24:17.757 --> 24:20.059
Whatever's happening
inside of me,

24:20.092 --> 24:21.928
it is happening very fast.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.229
So, I need you to promise me

24:23.262 --> 24:25.131
that you will do what
Dariela couldn't.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.535
I can't. You have to.

24:28.568 --> 24:29.536
Rafiki... Please.

24:29.569 --> 24:31.938
No. Listen to me!

24:34.073 --> 24:36.776
I don't want to hurt anybody
else, Abe.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.511
Okay?

24:43.550 --> 24:46.085
This...

24:46.118 --> 24:49.188
isn't you.

24:49.221 --> 24:52.759
But pretty soon, Abe,

24:52.792 --> 24:54.594
it's all that's
gonna be left of me.

24:54.627 --> 24:56.596
Jackson,
it doesn't have to come to that.

24:56.629 --> 24:57.463
What if it already has

24:57.496 --> 24:58.898
and we just don't know it
yet, Abe?

25:00.266 --> 25:03.636
I can't end up like Kovacs...

25:05.204 --> 25:07.239
like my mother.

25:07.273 --> 25:08.274
Please.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.011
It can only be you.

25:13.179 --> 25:15.648
You're my brother.

25:17.316 --> 25:19.819
You have my word.

25:27.994 --> 25:29.896
You wanted to see us?

25:31.330 --> 25:35.902
I was evaluating the medication
that your lab sent over.

25:35.935 --> 25:39.606
One in particular caught my eye...
SM-117.

25:39.639 --> 25:41.874
One of our most promising
neuroprotectants.

25:41.908 --> 25:43.051
You think it could help Jackson?

25:43.075 --> 25:45.578
This isn't about Jackson.

25:47.079 --> 25:50.116
The reason I'm
interested in SM-117

25:50.149 --> 25:51.429
is because I've
seen it before...

25:53.219 --> 25:56.789
in an experimental drug used
by Reiden Global to treat

25:56.823 --> 25:58.791
my daughter's Glazier's disease.

26:03.763 --> 26:06.666
Do you care to explain to
me how your neuroprotectant

26:06.699 --> 26:08.367
ended up in a phase
three drug trial?

26:08.400 --> 26:10.803
We should have been open
with you from the beginning.

26:10.837 --> 26:13.372
We gave SM-117 to Reiden Global.

26:13.405 --> 26:14.807
Why?

26:14.841 --> 26:17.710
Stopping the spread of
the animal mutation's

26:17.744 --> 26:20.079
been one of our top priorities.

26:20.112 --> 26:22.148
We've had some success...

26:22.181 --> 26:23.850
but there have
also been setbacks.

26:23.883 --> 26:27.219
You created Glazier's disease?

26:27.253 --> 26:28.988
I know this is
little consolation

26:29.021 --> 26:30.098
for the suffering your
daughter endured...

26:30.122 --> 26:31.123
Shut up.

26:32.124 --> 26:33.124
Shut up.

26:38.064 --> 26:40.667
This... mistake...

26:40.700 --> 26:43.135
was it based on your
work on the ghost gene?

26:43.169 --> 26:44.737
Yes, it was.

26:46.739 --> 26:50.710
And the-the fact that my,
my daughter was affected?

26:50.743 --> 26:52.178
That means she has
the ghost gene?

26:52.211 --> 26:53.713
I'm afraid so.

26:56.783 --> 26:57.383
Dr. Morgan...

26:57.416 --> 26:59.251
Get out.

26:59.285 --> 27:01.053
Just get out, please.

27:05.357 --> 27:07.694
No, no, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

27:12.464 --> 27:15.067
The gene that you
injected Jackson with,

27:15.101 --> 27:16.335
did you inject yourself?

27:16.368 --> 27:17.303
I did.

27:17.336 --> 27:19.038
Exact same synthetic version?

27:19.071 --> 27:20.039
It was.

27:20.072 --> 27:21.040
Why?

27:21.073 --> 27:23.242
You want to make it up to me?

27:23.275 --> 27:26.679
To my daughter and to all the
families of all the people

27:26.713 --> 27:28.748
that you killed with
Glazier's disease?

27:31.784 --> 27:33.786
Roll up your sleeve.

27:35.187 --> 27:36.155
How are you feeling?

27:36.188 --> 27:37.757
Peachy.

27:37.790 --> 27:39.859
Make sure the straps are tight.

27:39.892 --> 27:41.728
I've seen a lot of
improvised field medicine,

27:41.761 --> 27:44.263
but this is something else.

27:44.296 --> 27:47.166
You know, it's crazy
enough it just might work.

27:47.199 --> 27:49.368
I wish I'd thought of it.

27:49.401 --> 27:51.037
We don't have to
completely eliminate

27:51.070 --> 27:52.705
the badger acid from
Jackson's system,

27:52.739 --> 27:55.174
just reduce it.

27:55.207 --> 27:56.776
If we can increase
his blood volume

27:56.809 --> 27:58.310
with some genetically analogous

27:58.344 --> 27:59.378
whole blood cells.

27:59.411 --> 28:02.749
So, Robert's providing a
kind of genetic transfusion.

28:02.782 --> 28:05.351
Yeah.

28:05.384 --> 28:09.722
And we're only gonna get
one shot at this, so...

28:09.756 --> 28:10.823
everybody ready?

28:10.857 --> 28:12.859
Ready.

28:23.069 --> 28:24.203
(monitor beeping)

28:29.175 --> 28:30.242
What's happening?

28:30.276 --> 28:31.210
He's hypertensive.

28:31.243 --> 28:33.112
Is his blood pressure
still within range?

28:33.145 --> 28:35.081
Barely. 190/130.

28:35.114 --> 28:37.850
I'm fine. Keep going.

28:37.884 --> 28:39.285
Be strong, rafiki.

28:39.318 --> 28:40.820
(monitor beeping)

28:44.423 --> 28:47.193
Okay, the transfusion worked.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.229
The acid shouldn't
interfere with the serum.

28:50.262 --> 28:51.363
Home stretch, son.

28:51.397 --> 28:52.832
Thank God.

28:52.865 --> 28:54.000
(grunts)

28:59.839 --> 29:01.273
Jackson.

29:02.909 --> 29:04.777
With the acid diluted,
there's nothing

29:04.811 --> 29:05.778
holding the mutation back.

29:05.812 --> 29:06.478
We have to hurry.

29:06.512 --> 29:07.512
I need that serum.

29:13.119 --> 29:14.520
MITCH: Come on,
come on, come on.

29:14.553 --> 29:15.822
Here.

29:17.289 --> 29:18.466
All right,
I'm not gonna lie, buddy.

29:18.490 --> 29:19.458
This is, this is gonna hurt.

29:19.491 --> 29:20.491
Just do it!

29:39.578 --> 29:40.813
Jackson.

29:40.847 --> 29:42.248
Hey.

29:42.281 --> 29:44.250
You still with us?

29:47.519 --> 29:49.321
That wasn't so bad.

29:52.391 --> 29:53.459
What is that?

29:54.861 --> 29:57.329
That... would be our cure.

29:57.363 --> 29:59.031
(chuckles)

30:07.506 --> 30:09.241
We have a problem.

30:09.275 --> 30:11.377
Well, what now?

30:11.410 --> 30:15.114
Jackson's not producing
enough of the cure compound.

30:15.147 --> 30:16.615
No, you're right.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.584
There should be twice
that amount by now.

30:18.617 --> 30:21.120
Well, what does that mean?

30:21.153 --> 30:22.989
Hey, you said no more secrets.

30:23.022 --> 30:25.191
What does that mean?

30:25.224 --> 30:27.526
At this rate,
there's a good chance

30:27.559 --> 30:29.528
you'll die before you
produce enough of this.

30:29.561 --> 30:31.397
Okay, then bleed me dry.

30:31.430 --> 30:32.975
Take as much of the
compound as you need.

30:32.999 --> 30:35.001
Did you hear what he said?
Okay, that'll kill you.

30:35.034 --> 30:35.968
Yeah, I heard him.

30:36.002 --> 30:37.345
I... at least this way,
I die for something.

30:37.369 --> 30:38.604
No. No, listen, Dad,

30:38.637 --> 30:40.606
we tried... everything.

30:40.639 --> 30:43.009
No, no,
we haven't tried everything.

30:45.444 --> 30:48.414
Give me the genomic
fossil serum.

30:48.447 --> 30:49.949
Uh, you don't have the mutation.

30:49.982 --> 30:50.983
You can't do that.

30:51.017 --> 30:52.418
This isn't about me.

30:52.451 --> 30:54.086
This is about Jackson.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.354
With my body pre-staging

30:55.387 --> 30:56.222
the serum, Jackson won't have

30:56.255 --> 30:59.525
to work so hard to
synthesize the cure.

30:59.558 --> 31:04.030
It'll be like that Mother's
Day when you were five.

31:04.063 --> 31:05.564
You wanted to make
your mom an omelet.

31:05.597 --> 31:07.934
Oh, come on,
no omelet analogies.

31:07.967 --> 31:09.401
Indulge me.

31:09.435 --> 31:11.203
I cut the bell peppers,

31:11.237 --> 31:13.405
the mushrooms, cracked the eggs.

31:13.439 --> 31:15.641
And you poured
everything into the pan

31:15.674 --> 31:17.043
and finished the omelet.

31:17.076 --> 31:18.477
Remember? JACKSON: No.

31:18.510 --> 31:20.446
What I do remember is Mom coming

31:20.479 --> 31:23.115
(chuckling): downstairs and saying
that she was craving pancakes.

31:23.149 --> 31:25.051
She did, didn't she?

31:25.084 --> 31:27.586
The dog got the omelet
and we went to IHOP.

31:27.619 --> 31:29.121
Hey, Mitch, will this work?

31:32.491 --> 31:33.625
Yeah, I think so.

31:35.094 --> 31:36.662
Get the injection ready.

31:36.695 --> 31:40.266
And I think, um,
I think that was probably

31:40.299 --> 31:41.400
one of your mom's favorite.

31:41.433 --> 31:42.301
Mother's Days.

31:42.334 --> 31:44.070
JACKSON: Oh,
I don't know about that, Dad,

31:44.103 --> 31:47.006
but the dog sure got
a kick out of it.

31:48.374 --> 31:50.576
What-what-what will
the serum do to him?

31:50.609 --> 31:52.945
Oh, I'll be fine.

31:54.546 --> 31:57.283
Wait a second.

31:57.316 --> 31:58.350
Hey. Jackson.

31:58.384 --> 32:00.286
Wait... wait a second, Mitch.

32:00.319 --> 32:02.088
Jackson, there is no other way.
No, no, no.

32:02.121 --> 32:03.956
No, there is another way.
What is one life

32:03.990 --> 32:06.134
compared to the millions of
lives JACKSON: Put that down.

32:06.158 --> 32:07.259
That will be saved? Mitch!

32:07.293 --> 32:08.694
I don't care.
Mitch, stop walk...

32:08.727 --> 32:10.638
This is the way that it has to be!
Mitch, stop walking over there!

32:10.662 --> 32:12.664
Put that down!

32:12.698 --> 32:14.233
Put that down right now!

32:14.266 --> 32:15.167
Okay?!

32:15.201 --> 32:17.569
Just everyone cr...
just everyone calm down.

32:17.603 --> 32:18.604
I'm sorry, Jackson.

32:18.637 --> 32:20.272
No, no!

32:20.306 --> 32:21.407
No!

32:26.278 --> 32:28.981
Thank you, Dr. Morgan.

32:29.015 --> 32:30.149
Thank you.

32:37.456 --> 32:40.359
(breathing heavily)

32:43.595 --> 32:45.597
(sighs)

32:51.770 --> 32:53.972
Poor Jackson.

32:56.608 --> 32:58.610
Poor Robert.

33:11.290 --> 33:13.392
ROBERT: All right,
I got one for you.

33:13.425 --> 33:14.693
Okay.

33:14.726 --> 33:16.628
Why did the cow
become an astronaut?

33:16.662 --> 33:18.564
(laughs)

33:18.597 --> 33:20.299
Because he wanted to walk on...

33:20.332 --> 33:22.334
BOTH: The moo-oon.

33:23.735 --> 33:25.504
You realize how odd it is

33:25.537 --> 33:27.306
that all of our jokes
are animal-based?

33:27.339 --> 33:28.507
(laughs)

33:28.540 --> 33:30.509
Of course.
It was always about the animal.

33:30.542 --> 33:32.511
(chuckles)

33:32.544 --> 33:35.047
How you feeling, son?

33:35.081 --> 33:36.715
Better.

33:36.748 --> 33:39.551
Good. Good.

33:41.653 --> 33:43.589
I'm sorry, Jackson. Oh...

33:43.622 --> 33:45.591
No, let me finish.

33:45.624 --> 33:49.395
I never got a chance to
say this to your mother,

33:49.428 --> 33:53.165
and she deserved to hear it,
so let me at least say it to you.

33:53.199 --> 33:56.202
I thought that I knew best.

33:56.235 --> 33:59.405
I always thought
that I knew best.

33:59.438 --> 34:04.210
Truth be told,
lying here in this chair, dying,

34:04.243 --> 34:06.778
fluids draining from my body,

34:06.812 --> 34:09.148
amidst an animal apocalypse

34:09.181 --> 34:14.186
that I may be partially
responsible for, I...

34:14.219 --> 34:16.621
I still think that I know best.

34:16.655 --> 34:18.657
But that's my arrogance.

34:20.692 --> 34:25.331
The same arrogance that assured
me that I could save all of us,

34:25.364 --> 34:27.299
that you and your mom
would finally understand

34:27.333 --> 34:29.101
and come back to me.

34:29.135 --> 34:31.137
But instead,
I almost lost both of you.

34:33.539 --> 34:35.507
Jackson, I thank God

34:35.541 --> 34:38.076
I finally had the
chance to make it right.

34:39.378 --> 34:42.148
If not with your mother,
than at least with you.

34:44.315 --> 34:46.818
Mom would have loved to have
known the truth about you.

34:48.487 --> 34:50.789
You were always such
a mystery to us.

34:50.822 --> 34:52.391
To me.

34:52.424 --> 34:55.194
Well,
I hope you solved it by now.

34:57.229 --> 34:58.897
"Against all odds,

34:58.930 --> 35:02.501
a hero still makes it
home in time for supper."

35:02.534 --> 35:05.471
Hey, I got one for you.
You ready?

35:05.504 --> 35:09.475
What did the aardvark
say to the taxi driver?

35:13.645 --> 35:15.647
Dad?

35:19.285 --> 35:20.319
Mitch?

35:34.600 --> 35:36.602
I'm sorry.

35:40.739 --> 35:42.774
Untie me.

35:42.808 --> 35:44.510
Please untie me.

35:56.988 --> 35:59.458
It worked.

36:20.479 --> 36:22.514
I'm right here, Dad.

36:26.485 --> 36:29.288
I'm right here.

36:48.407 --> 36:51.977
(birds singing and cooing)

36:59.618 --> 37:02.321
(wings flapping)

37:19.638 --> 37:21.640
(birds cooing and singing)

37:21.907 --> 37:23.875
You did this.

37:23.909 --> 37:26.612
We did this.

37:26.645 --> 37:28.780
All of us.

37:28.814 --> 37:30.782
(birds singing and cooing)

37:36.688 --> 37:39.358
Look at them. They're normal.

37:39.391 --> 37:41.660
It's been a long time

37:41.693 --> 37:45.697
since I've seen animals
behave as an animal should.

37:45.731 --> 37:47.733
(birds cooing)

37:53.739 --> 37:55.874
(bird chirping)

37:55.907 --> 37:58.610
This will activate the release
switch on all the cages.

37:58.644 --> 38:01.547
There are seven launch
points around the island.

38:01.580 --> 38:03.515
The birds are ready when you
are, Professor.

38:16.428 --> 38:18.364
I wish Chloe were here.

38:18.397 --> 38:21.567
Chloe would have loved this
day more than anything.

38:21.600 --> 38:25.837
To see the animals, the world,
back to the way it once was.

38:32.978 --> 38:35.581
Well, what are you waiting for?
Push it already.

38:40.552 --> 38:41.552
(beep)

38:42.621 --> 38:45.924
(birds singing)

39:08.980 --> 39:11.717
(birds singing)

39:37.042 --> 39:39.478
Hey, you ever been to Maine?

39:39.511 --> 39:41.480
No.

39:42.514 --> 39:44.783
Would you like to
go to Maine with me?

39:48.520 --> 39:52.458
There's, um,
somebody there I'd like you to meet.

39:53.925 --> 39:55.927
Clem?

39:58.564 --> 40:00.165
Oh, yeah.

40:00.198 --> 40:01.767
Yeah, I-I would love that.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.068
Good.

40:03.101 --> 40:04.870
Then can we get out of here?

40:04.903 --> 40:06.872
(laughs) Yeah.

40:06.905 --> 40:09.007
Yeah, I'll call Trotter.

40:09.040 --> 40:11.042
Okay.

40:17.683 --> 40:19.685
So what's next?

40:20.719 --> 40:22.754
I don't know.

40:22.788 --> 40:25.591
And to be honest,
not knowing feels pretty good.

40:25.624 --> 40:27.893
I miss Africa.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.895
So do I.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.830
Assuming all will
be well from now on.

40:31.863 --> 40:35.767
How does Botswana sound to you?

40:35.801 --> 40:37.803
Sounds like home.

40:40.639 --> 40:41.740
Trotter?

40:41.773 --> 40:42.874
Yes, ma'am.

40:42.908 --> 40:44.510
Hey, we did it.

40:44.543 --> 40:46.845
Let's get the plane and
go back to the mainland.

40:46.878 --> 40:49.247
No can do.
The air space has been closed.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.149
What?

40:51.182 --> 40:52.718
Where?

40:52.751 --> 40:54.886
Everywhere.

40:54.920 --> 40:57.956
Standing by.

41:06.164 --> 41:08.166
(computer trilling)

41:12.571 --> 41:15.574
(excited chatter,
cheering and whooping)

41:20.078 --> 41:21.647
If air space is shut down

41:21.680 --> 41:23.782
all over the globe,
then that means...

41:23.815 --> 41:25.884
Oh, my God.

41:25.917 --> 41:27.919
My fellow Shepherds,

41:27.953 --> 41:30.622
the Noah Objective has launched.

41:30.656 --> 41:33.191
The gas has been released.

41:33.224 --> 41:35.193
And the birds have
left the beach.

41:35.226 --> 41:37.929
Our work is finally complete.

41:37.963 --> 41:41.499
(applause and cheering)

41:42.801 --> 41:45.070
They're dropping the gas.
They're dropping the gas!

41:45.103 --> 41:46.772
The Noah Objective...

41:46.805 --> 41:49.207
The Noah Objective... it's on.
They've cleared the air space.

41:49.240 --> 41:51.076
The planes are in
the air already.

41:51.109 --> 41:53.679
You said you took care
of the Noah Objective.

41:53.712 --> 41:55.814
And I did. The planes are doing

41:55.847 --> 41:57.148
exactly what
they're meant to do.

41:57.182 --> 41:58.216
You did this?

41:58.249 --> 42:00.952
(gun chambers clicking)

42:00.986 --> 42:02.954
We just released the cure!

42:02.988 --> 42:05.323
What are...?
That gas is gonna kill all

42:05.356 --> 42:07.158
the animals, Mansdale.

42:08.994 --> 42:10.962
And Clem.

42:10.996 --> 42:13.231
(grunting) Hey! Hey!

42:13.264 --> 42:16.001
(indistinct chatter, grunting)

42:16.034 --> 42:18.970
What have you done?!
It makes no sense!

42:19.004 --> 42:22.841
It'll all be clear to you,
to the entire world, very soon.

42:22.874 --> 42:24.576
(grunting): Son of a bitch!

42:24.610 --> 42:25.711
(grunting)

42:25.744 --> 42:27.112
Get them out of here!

42:27.145 --> 42:28.980
Hey! Hey! What did you do?

42:29.014 --> 42:30.115
(indistinct chatter)

42:30.148 --> 42:32.250
What did you do, Mansdale?
What did you do?

42:32.283 --> 42:33.719
Don't...

42:33.752 --> 42:34.920
You son of a bitch!

42:34.953 --> 42:38.256
What did you do?!

42:38.289 --> 42:40.291
(yelling)
