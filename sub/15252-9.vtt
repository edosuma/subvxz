00:00.700 --> 00:03.350
In my life lately:

00:03.350 --> 00:05.310
i'm a little worried about our cover.

00:05.310 --> 00:06.990
I think it's time for us to make love.

00:07.230 --> 00:10.480
I own a deli in the mall, and i often
think about meats and cheeses.

00:11.160 --> 00:14.140
You do know we're just spending
the night together for cover,right?

00:14.140 --> 00:18.090
By now,i'd say i'm pretty familiar
with the concept of faking it,so...

00:18.090 --> 00:20.500
You're interested in
that lou girl,aren't you?

00:20.500 --> 00:21.810
Sarah is my...

00:23.010 --> 00:24.680
Girlfriend.
mm-hmm.

00:24.680 --> 00:30.900
You and me,our thing under the undercover thing,
is this ever going anywhere?

00:32.159 --> 00:32.990
No.

00:33.110 --> 00:34.020
We need to break up.

00:34.120 --> 00:36.790
You know,like,fake break up our
pretend relationship.

01:21.060 --> 01:24.860
Three,two,one,bingo.

01:25.360 --> 01:27.330
I'm sorry.I'm on a break.

01:30.530 --> 01:31.700
Eat news,pal.

01:31.700 --> 01:33.590
I am free this evening for a meal.

01:33.770 --> 01:37.060
Thinking about a little surf and turf,right?
Half meatball,half tuna sub.

01:37.060 --> 01:39.820
Then boom! Call of duty 4,
modern warfare.

01:39.960 --> 01:40.750
Me and you.

01:40.920 --> 01:43.350
Sniper on my back watching me.
Oscar delta.

01:43.350 --> 01:45.770
I would love to,but i-i have plans tonight.

01:46.080 --> 01:47.820
Don't sweat it.
Me,too,slammed.

01:47.820 --> 01:48.700
What are you and the lady doing?

01:48.700 --> 01:53.230
Uh,actually,the lady and i are
no mas.It's over.

01:53.550 --> 01:54.800
Ah,i knew this would happen.

01:54.800 --> 01:55.990
Dude,i'm sorry.Damn it!

01:55.990 --> 01:57.680
Women can be so cruel.

01:57.680 --> 02:01.490
You know,as a matter of fact,
i'm the one who did the breaking up.

02:01.840 --> 02:03.150
She just wasn't the right girl for me.

02:03.150 --> 02:03.880
Right girl?

02:03.880 --> 02:05.410
Are you out of your mind,dude?

02:05.410 --> 02:07.000
She is the hottest piece we are
ever gonna get!

02:07.000 --> 02:11.300
Listen,i didn't really see a future for
sarah and i,ultimately,

02:11.300 --> 02:13.320
and so i didn't want to waste any more time.

02:19.290 --> 02:20.610
Beg for her back,charles.

02:27.520 --> 02:28.760
Go yeah.
Yeah.

02:28.760 --> 02:29.780
What's going on there?

02:29.780 --> 02:33.020
Uh,just a little thing i call
"operation devastation.

02:33.130 --> 02:33.930
" explain.

02:33.930 --> 02:34.630
Okay.

02:34.630 --> 02:36.420
My boy about to dump the wiener chick.

02:36.420 --> 02:37.030
What?

02:37.030 --> 02:38.460
No way.
Don't lie.You liar.

02:38.560 --> 02:39.240
I'm not lying.

02:39.240 --> 02:40.510
All right?Relax.

02:40.510 --> 02:41.880
She wasn't the right girl.

02:42.150 --> 02:43.350
What?
Yeah.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.280
Right girl?

02:48.140 --> 02:48.960
What does that mean?

02:51.180 --> 02:56.520
Look,chuck,i've been thinking about our break up,
and i'm not so sure it's the best idea.

02:56.740 --> 02:57.840
Miss me already,huh?

02:58.290 --> 03:00.570
Well,just,you know,for the cover,
it makes things easier.

03:00.570 --> 03:02.490
Well,then i guess your job's
gonna be a little bit harder.

03:03.070 --> 03:07.530
Look,i'm sorry if you thought there
was something between us.

03:07.700 --> 03:12.040
It's very common in these situations to
perceive a connection that isn't there.

03:12.040 --> 03:13.530
Of course.I get it.

03:13.530 --> 03:15.420
It's the old story,you know?

03:15.420 --> 03:19.240
Guy gets supercomputer in his brain,
beautiful cia agent is sent to protect him,

03:19.240 --> 03:22.100
and then she tells him, while under the
spell of truth serum,that she's not interested.

03:22.100 --> 03:22.840
I get it.

03:22.960 --> 03:25.810
But for me,the emotional roller
coaster is a little much,

03:25.810 --> 03:30.690
so i think i'd rather find something a little
less common, like, say, i don't know, a, uh,

03:30.690 --> 03:31.850
a real relationship.

03:31.950 --> 03:34.480
Okay,chuck,well,if that's what you want,
then i'm gonna have to sell it.

03:44.470 --> 03:45.360
You okay?

03:48.310 --> 03:49.220
Sarah?

03:53.360 --> 03:54.330
Heartbreaker.

03:54.330 --> 03:55.110
dream ker.

03:55.110 --> 03:55.940
Love taker.

03:55.940 --> 03:57.200
Don't you mess around with chuck.

03:57.200 --> 03:58.170
Check this out.

04:00.710 --> 04:01.410
Hey,buddy.

04:01.960 --> 04:03.070
Heard about what happened.

04:03.070 --> 04:04.270
Are you...Are you okay?

04:04.760 --> 04:06.180
Yeah,i'm-i'm fine,lester.

04:06.180 --> 04:07.330
Thanks for asking.Yeah,no problem.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.410
Now that you're done with sarah,
you mind if i take a crack at her?

04:10.580 --> 04:11.960
Hey,swing away,champ.

04:11.960 --> 04:12.940
You bet,brother.

04:14.100 --> 04:15.550
Where you going?
Don't run from me,all right?

04:15.660 --> 04:17.380
We need to talk about our
emotions and all that crap.

04:17.480 --> 04:18.360
I'm sorry,buddy.

04:18.360 --> 04:20.390
You're gonna have to weep
without me,i got a date.

04:20.640 --> 04:21.690
What?
Get out of here.

04:21.690 --> 04:24.260
Already?
Good for you,hotshot.With who?

04:24.260 --> 04:24.890
Just someone i met.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.830
Makes sandwiches.Deli owner.

04:27.640 --> 04:29.510
Okay,hold on a second.A pro?

04:33.930 --> 04:35.650
Who ordered the capracola?

04:46.370 --> 04:48.510
I don't like the idea of this break up at all.

04:48.510 --> 04:49.660
What the hell happened?

04:49.660 --> 04:50.770
She got dumped.

04:51.100 --> 04:53.940
We decided that it would be best
for chuck to date a civilian.

04:54.200 --> 04:57.230
It will help secure his cover
in the event that someone ids me.

04:57.230 --> 04:58.480
Yeah,because she got dumped.

04:58.480 --> 04:59.580
Let me get this straight.

04:59.750 --> 05:02.360
Some woman comes in off the street
and starts dating the asset,

05:02.360 --> 05:04.500
and this doesn't strike either
of you as suspicious.

05:04.500 --> 05:05.830
It's not completely unfeasible.

05:05.830 --> 05:07.590
He is a reasonably charming guy.

05:07.590 --> 05:08.960
I've heard enough.

05:08.960 --> 05:12.850
I want to know everything there is to
know about this woman before she gets too close.

05:23.930 --> 05:24.690
Wait,wait.

05:28.610 --> 05:31.870
Wow,it's,uh,it's been a while since i've done that.

05:31.870 --> 05:32.600
Me,too.

05:32.820 --> 05:34.060
I think i tweaked my neck.

05:35.100 --> 05:38.130
Well,it,uh,it wouldn't be an official
chuck bartowski date

05:38.130 --> 05:40.130
if the woman didn't leave
injured in some way.

05:45.950 --> 05:46.830
And i don't...

05:46.950 --> 05:50.120
Usually do this on first dates,
but you want to come inside?

05:51.230 --> 05:52.110
Yeah.

05:53.410 --> 05:56.020
I'm about to make you a very happy man.

06:05.640 --> 06:09.680
Oh,my god,you're so good.

06:10.280 --> 06:11.400
That is so amazing.

06:11.400 --> 06:12.200
Wow!

06:12.200 --> 06:13.290
Do you really like it?

06:13.570 --> 06:14.380
Oh!

06:14.690 --> 06:15.350
Oh!

06:15.350 --> 06:16.120
Like it?

06:16.280 --> 06:17.190
Yeah!

06:17.190 --> 06:18.230
Yeah,i like it.

06:18.230 --> 06:19.680
I-i love it.

06:30.380 --> 06:31.620
What's wrong?You don't like it?

06:31.730 --> 06:32.820
It's the chopped liver,isn't it?

06:32.820 --> 06:33.900
Huh?What?

06:34.540 --> 06:35.990
No,no,i...

06:36.080 --> 06:37.770
No,it's amazing.It's amazing.

06:37.770 --> 06:38.540
You're...

06:38.740 --> 06:39.800
You're...Amazing.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.240
What is,um,what is,what is that?

06:43.330 --> 06:45.200
What?The invite thing?

06:45.510 --> 06:48.190
Oh,it's nothing.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.310
Some invitation for a party at,uh...

06:51.660 --> 06:52.960
Club ares.

06:53.740 --> 06:55.860
Who is stavros demetrios?

06:56.320 --> 06:57.310
My ex.

06:57.410 --> 06:58.550
He owns the place.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.600
Why,do you know him?
No,not really,no.

07:00.600 --> 07:01.270
Good.

07:01.270 --> 07:02.610
You don't want to.

07:02.610 --> 07:04.920
He thought i was dating some guy
and he trashed his car.

07:04.920 --> 07:05.940
Threatened to kill him.

07:06.750 --> 07:09.610
Believe me,the last thing you want
is that lunatic swimming around in your head.

07:44.870 --> 07:49.730
stavros demetrios,a handsome playboy,
owns and operates a number of la clubs.

07:49.830 --> 07:51.060
I don't think he's that handsome.

07:51.490 --> 07:54.600
He's the son of yari demetrios,
the shipping magnate.

07:55.320 --> 07:57.120
What do you mean by playboy?

07:57.120 --> 07:58.370
What kind of intel do we have on that?

07:58.370 --> 08:03.460
What we have is information that
a volatile package is coming to los angeles.

08:03.460 --> 08:07.960
The cargo itself is time-sensitive,which,
knowing the demetrios family ties to the middle east,

08:07.960 --> 08:09.100
could mean a weapon.

08:09.100 --> 08:12.590
Chuck,we need you to get as close to stavros
as possible and see if you flash on anything

08:12.590 --> 08:13.820
related to the shipment.

08:13.820 --> 08:16.600
What?What?
You want me to get close to my girlfriend's ex?

08:16.600 --> 08:17.480
W do you want me to do that?

08:17.480 --> 08:18.920
Plus,i don't want to get her
involved in all this.

08:18.920 --> 08:21.460
why don't you and your girlfriend
hit club ares tonight?

08:21.460 --> 08:23.260
I hear it's supposed to be all the rage.

08:28.810 --> 08:29.820
How's my breath?

08:29.920 --> 08:30.970
Like the ocean.

08:31.590 --> 08:32.570
Aye,aye,captain.

08:37.299 --> 08:38.370
Are you kidding me?

08:38.580 --> 08:40.169
Everybody in this place is scoring.

08:40.169 --> 08:41.370
Chuck's on to his second lady.

08:41.370 --> 08:42.210
What do we got?

08:42.330 --> 08:43.299
Nothing.

08:43.299 --> 08:47.220
I don't know about you,but i intend to
make the most out of the seeds i've been planting.

08:48.690 --> 08:49.830
What are you talking about?

08:50.190 --> 08:52.030
I'm gonna tag anna.

08:52.030 --> 08:53.000
Are you kidding?

08:53.100 --> 08:54.300
You make me sick.

08:54.620 --> 08:56.060
I'd rather get with morgan.

09:04.400 --> 09:06.090
Hey,larry,what can i get for you?

09:06.090 --> 09:06.890
Lester.

09:06.890 --> 09:10.550
I want to say i was sorry to
hear about you and chuck.

09:10.960 --> 09:15.500
And if you needed someone to talk to,
i'm here for you.

09:16.030 --> 09:17.150
That's very sweet.

09:17.490 --> 09:18.270
Thank you.

09:18.540 --> 09:19.710
Want to catch a movie?

09:20.280 --> 09:21.080
Grab a bite?

09:22.690 --> 09:25.870
You're asking me out a day after
i broke up with your friend?

09:28.180 --> 09:30.420
All's fair in love and war,sarah.

09:32.870 --> 09:34.130
You know what you seem like to me?

09:34.130 --> 09:34.900
Hmm?

09:37.110 --> 09:38.250
A man who...

09:38.990 --> 09:40.370
Knows what he wants.

09:41.110 --> 09:47.490
Sure,you know,We could go through
all the motions-- coffee,movie,dinner--

09:47.720 --> 09:52.920
or we could just skip all of that nonsense
and i could just devour you right here.

09:55.010 --> 09:56.500
This should hold us.

09:57.280 --> 09:59.650
It's,it's an interesting,uh,thought.

09:59.650 --> 10:02.130
Let me think about that proposition.

10:02.140 --> 10:02.750
Whoops.

10:02.750 --> 10:04.610
Your feet seemed to have slipped...

10:04.610 --> 10:06.510
Is that jeff,uh,calling me?

10:06.510 --> 10:08.620
I-i will be right there,jeff!

10:08.990 --> 10:09.850
I'm just gonna...

10:10.950 --> 10:12.410
What about that movie?

10:15.600 --> 10:16.480
Hey,lou.

10:21.800 --> 10:22.530
Hi.

10:24.280 --> 10:25.110
Hi.

10:25.320 --> 10:26.550
Nice to see you again.

10:27.860 --> 10:29.170
You know,he's a great guy.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.710
Yeah,um,i've had the same opinion so far,too.

10:32.710 --> 10:34.390
It's not an opinion,it's a fact.

10:36.350 --> 10:37.240
Don't hurt him.

10:37.920 --> 10:38.700
Okay.

10:38.900 --> 10:40.220
Wasn't planning on it.

10:41.290 --> 10:42.600
Thanks for the heads up,though.

10:51.320 --> 10:52.090
Excuse me.

10:53.160 --> 10:54.740
Hi.
Do you know where i can find chuck?

10:55.350 --> 10:57.280
Ah,the sandwich maker.

10:57.280 --> 10:59.720
I have heard so much about you.

11:00.130 --> 11:00.880
Thank you.

11:01.100 --> 11:03.060
And i must be...

11:03.570 --> 11:05.440
A guy who works at the buy more?
Close.

11:05.440 --> 11:06.620
Morgan grimes.

11:06.620 --> 11:08.930
Chuck's best friend,soul mate.

11:09.030 --> 11:10.150
He hasn't mentioned me.

11:10.380 --> 11:11.050
Sorry.

11:11.050 --> 11:13.480
Probably means he doesn't think
you're gonna be sticking around for a while.

11:14.410 --> 11:15.150
Hey.

11:15.250 --> 11:16.050
There you are.

11:16.050 --> 11:17.140
I'm glad you two finally met.

11:17.140 --> 11:17.970
Yeah.

11:17.970 --> 11:18.670
Hmm.

11:18.670 --> 11:19.980
I brought you some lunch.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.160
Oh,thank you.

11:22.160 --> 11:24.790
Mmm,i smell salami,
black olives tapenade.

11:24.790 --> 11:28.180
Okay,this,this might actually
have a shot at working out.

11:30.550 --> 11:32.800
Well,morgan approval,that's very big.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.350
I seem to be getting that
from all angles today.

11:35.350 --> 11:36.990
Just had a moment with your ex.

11:36.990 --> 11:37.770
Did ya?

11:38.100 --> 11:42.470
Yeah,she's,uh,she can be a little
overprotective sometimes.

11:42.470 --> 11:50.000
But speaking of exes,um,i was thinking maybe,
uh,we could go to that party thing at ares tonight.

11:50.100 --> 11:50.750
No.You know what?

11:50.750 --> 11:52.480
Trust me,bad plan.

11:52.480 --> 11:56.980
Look,sooner or later he's gonna
find out about me,and i'd rather just...

11:56.980 --> 11:58.040
Make the peace now.

11:59.020 --> 12:00.880
Charming,handsome and brave.

12:00.880 --> 12:02.710
You know,that's a
combination i'm not used to.

12:02.710 --> 12:05.560
Yeah,it's a little...

12:05.690 --> 12:07.060
Little new for me,too.

12:10.520 --> 12:13.080
We're only on our second official
date,and already i'm lying to her.

12:13.080 --> 12:13.730
Relax.

12:13.730 --> 12:14.920
It's dating in la.

12:14.920 --> 12:15.870
Everyone lies.

12:16.470 --> 12:18.280
We're going to be tapped into the
club's surveillance feed.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.140
All we need is the audio.

12:19.140 --> 12:21.850
This has an rk-7 mini mic that
works up to 20 feet.

12:21.850 --> 12:24.770
I want you to keep it as close
to stavros as possible.

12:25.990 --> 12:27.660
Are you kidding?
Are you kidding me with this?

12:28.210 --> 12:29.020
I can't wear this.

12:29.020 --> 12:29.970
This looks ridiculous.

12:29.970 --> 12:32.070
The alternative is we join you on your date.

12:32.910 --> 12:33.700
Fine.

12:37.510 --> 12:39.550
Ear wig.
It never stops with you people,does it?

12:43.570 --> 12:44.830
Aren't you forgetting something,romeo?

12:46.270 --> 12:47.590
Let me guess.

12:47.590 --> 12:49.990
This is equipped with some kind of microscopic,

12:49.990 --> 12:54.560
infrared tracking device that determines
her mother's communist affiliations?

12:54.560 --> 12:55.430
No,idiot.

12:55.430 --> 12:56.580
It's so you can get laid.

13:15.700 --> 13:16.600
usually...I'm sorry.

13:16.600 --> 13:18.110
I usually get more respect at the door.

13:18.110 --> 13:19.590
You know,i-i come here a lot.

13:19.960 --> 13:21.900
Normally,it's here on monday,
on monday nights,and then...

13:22.020 --> 13:23.970
And then,uh,tuesdays at hyde.

13:23.970 --> 13:24.750
I'm on the circuit.

13:24.750 --> 13:26.060
You know,i do my thing.

13:26.700 --> 13:28.600
I can't hear a word that you're saying!

13:29.200 --> 13:30.010
What was that?

13:30.010 --> 13:31.060
i love this song.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.010
Do you want to dance?

13:32.480 --> 13:33.490
No.I normally,uh...

13:33.490 --> 13:37.000
I normally require some social
lubricant before entering a dance floor.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.350
Hello,sweetheart.

13:39.150 --> 13:40.050
stavros.

13:40.550 --> 13:41.760
Uh,this is chuck.

13:41.980 --> 13:43.100
Chuck,stavros.

13:43.100 --> 13:43.810
Hi.

13:44.090 --> 13:44.820
Cool pin.

13:45.480 --> 13:47.670
I'd have worn mine,but i lost it in the '80s.

13:49.040 --> 13:50.170
I kept mine.

13:50.170 --> 13:51.130
Nice to see you.

13:51.820 --> 13:52.700
Whoa.Whoa.

13:52.700 --> 13:53.540
Where you going?

13:53.640 --> 13:55.300
At least let me buy your new friend a drink.

13:55.430 --> 13:56.810
No,thanks.Um...

13:57.770 --> 13:58.970
have the drink,chuck.

13:59.160 --> 14:00.240
Yeah,maybe...Maybe justne.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.070
Look,vip on me.

14:09.310 --> 14:11.130
Way to own the noobs,morgan!

14:11.840 --> 14:13.190
Use your deep impact perk.

14:13.190 --> 14:14.240
Don't-don't backseat perk me.

14:14.240 --> 14:15.680
I-i know when to use my perks.

14:16.390 --> 14:20.440
I have to tell you,morgan,i think you're
one of the best call of duty 4 players in the store.

14:22.550 --> 14:23.250
Really?

14:27.120 --> 14:29.360
You know,i-i heard what you said to jeff.

14:29.780 --> 14:33.250
I think that you should not fight it anymore.

14:33.250 --> 14:36.510
You know,just sort of,um,
succumb to your desire,you know,just...

14:39.320 --> 14:40.790
Morgan,what are you doing?

14:41.520 --> 14:42.660
I thought you wanted me!

14:42.660 --> 14:44.280
Because i said i efer you to jeff?

14:44.500 --> 14:45.820
I'd take lester over jeff.

14:45.820 --> 14:47.560
Doesn't mean i'm into that loser.

14:48.360 --> 14:50.380
But you'd take me over lester,right?

14:51.700 --> 14:53.680
Okay,listen,can you keep this
between me and you,please?

14:53.790 --> 14:55.280
You know,don't-don't tell anybody!

15:03.910 --> 15:06.040
That's aged ten years in oak.

15:09.290 --> 15:10.920
**

15:11.400 --> 15:12.910
Can you taste it,jack?

15:14.480 --> 15:17.070
Chuck,and,uh,yes,i think i did...

15:17.070 --> 15:21.500
I think i did taste it,although, that-that also
could have been a piece of your liver.

15:22.380 --> 15:23.470
I love this guy!

15:23.650 --> 15:24.740
He's a charmer.

15:26.320 --> 15:27.650
Hey,you.

15:27.750 --> 15:28.510
Hey.
Hi.

15:28.510 --> 15:29.660
Can i get you something,anything?

15:29.660 --> 15:30.950
Can i get some more wine?

15:31.080 --> 15:32.950
Oh,don't do that,jack.

15:32.950 --> 15:34.410
You don't want to get on her bad side.

15:34.410 --> 15:35.660
Fiery italian.

15:35.840 --> 15:37.240
Stavros...
What?

15:37.240 --> 15:40.500
You think i'm going to tell him
about the trip to mykonos where you
threw a lamp at my head?

15:41.280 --> 15:42.420
Still have the scar.

15:44.340 --> 15:46.210
I thought...I thought you said she
threw it at your head.

15:46.210 --> 15:47.020
She did.

15:47.290 --> 15:48.910
The scar is from the make-up sex.

15:49.320 --> 15:50.410
She's a tiger.

15:51.120 --> 15:52.270
get on with it,chuck!

15:52.270 --> 15:56.230
Um,so stavros,uh,you're in the,uh...

15:56.230 --> 15:57.240
You're in the club game?

15:58.020 --> 15:59.190
Don't worry about it.

16:00.270 --> 16:01.180
You seem nerus.

16:01.180 --> 16:02.080
I'm...
Relax.

16:02.080 --> 16:02.980
I'm not.

16:04.110 --> 16:06.270
Ooh,you got a small neck,huh?

16:06.380 --> 16:07.230
Thank you very much.

16:07.230 --> 16:08.230
Like a chicken.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.240
He does have a small neck.

16:12.340 --> 16:13.540
Maybe i should go in.

16:15.250 --> 16:16.540
Same bit with you,huh?

16:17.280 --> 16:18.500
What's that supposed to mean?

16:18.500 --> 16:19.690
You need me to spell it out?

16:20.440 --> 16:21.180
Fine.

16:21.460 --> 16:23.220
You fall for the guys you work with.

16:23.220 --> 16:25.100
First bryce,now our boy chuck.

16:25.230 --> 16:28.420
Bryce was a mistake,
and i haven't fallen for chuck.

16:28.740 --> 16:29.770
Yeah,whatever you say.

16:30.250 --> 16:32.750
And just so we're clear,sister,not interested.

16:33.960 --> 16:36.600
have you ever snapped a
chicken's neck,chuck?

16:36.700 --> 16:37.830
Can't say that i have.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.350
It's much easier than you would think.

16:40.350 --> 16:41.520
That's it.I'm going in.

16:42.110 --> 16:43.000
Hey,no.

16:43.380 --> 16:44.100
Hey!

16:44.250 --> 16:45.020
Walker!

16:48.630 --> 16:49.400
chuck?

16:51.090 --> 16:52.550
Isn't that your ex-girlfriend?

16:56.810 --> 16:57.520
Yes,it is.

16:57.520 --> 16:58.390
Yes.

16:58.920 --> 16:59.680
Sorry.

16:59.680 --> 17:01.980
Uh,she's having a hard time letting go.

17:02.770 --> 17:04.260
It's happened to me before.

17:04.260 --> 17:04.950
A lot,actually.

17:04.950 --> 17:06.490
I don't...You know,i better go talk to her.

17:06.490 --> 17:08.030
I'll be right back.I'm so sorry.

17:08.910 --> 17:10.040
Hey,i'm sorry.I'm sorry.

17:10.040 --> 17:10.849
Excuse me.Excuse me.

17:10.849 --> 17:12.349
Hey,what are you doing here?

17:12.349 --> 17:14.240
I wanted to make sure you're okay.

17:14.470 --> 17:15.470
i'm on a...

17:15.470 --> 17:17.410
I'm on a date,okay?

17:17.410 --> 17:19.240
Just,you're ruining it right now!

17:21.099 --> 17:22.710
I'm fine!I'm fine!

17:22.710 --> 17:23.910
Just...Just go!

17:23.910 --> 17:24.990
Okay,fine.

17:25.880 --> 17:27.589
But your girlfriend is leaving.

17:29.690 --> 17:30.730
Excuse me.I'm sorry.

17:30.730 --> 17:31.970
Excuse me.Excuse me.Excuse me.

17:31.970 --> 17:33.100
Hey,where are you going?

17:33.100 --> 17:36.470
You've spent the entire night either with my ex or yours.

17:36.470 --> 17:37.770
This date is over,okay?

17:37.770 --> 17:38.580
I'm out of here.

17:38.860 --> 17:39.920
Lou,wait.Excuse me.

17:39.920 --> 17:40.660
No,no.

17:41.030 --> 17:41.800
Lou?

17:41.800 --> 17:43.430
No,don't go!Don't go!Don't go!

17:54.180 --> 17:54.930
Excuse me...

17:56.050 --> 17:59.100
Casey?Casey,stavros' father yari just walked in!
I got it.

17:59.100 --> 18:00.040
He's heading towards his son.

18:00.040 --> 18:00.780
Get the mic closer.

18:00.780 --> 18:01.880
I need to hear what they're saying.

18:06.890 --> 18:08.420
Chuck,get over there!Now!

18:12.540 --> 18:14.210
Damn it,chuck,what are you waiting for?

18:15.070 --> 18:16.500
Okay.Excuse me.

18:16.610 --> 18:17.670
I beg your pardon.
I'm so sorry.I'm so sorry.

18:17.670 --> 18:18.970
Excuse me,i have to get...

18:19.220 --> 18:22.100
I was just...I literally was just in there,like,two seconds ago.

18:24.820 --> 18:25.660
Okay,chuck,this is it!

18:25.660 --> 18:26.570
Get the mic closer.

18:31.550 --> 18:32.150
Okay,you know what?

18:32.150 --> 18:34.060
I probably...Was over there,so i'm going to...

18:40.150 --> 18:41.030
Thank you.

18:41.450 --> 18:45.260
4:00 tomorrow afternoon,san pedro.

18:45.470 --> 18:48.670
The package is time sensitive,so,if it expires,we're all dead.

18:50.080 --> 18:50.890
Got you.

18:53.520 --> 18:54.870
Excuse me.Excuse me.Excuse me.

18:55.050 --> 18:55.810
Lou,wait!

18:55.810 --> 18:57.600
Wait,wait,wait,wait,wait,wait,wait!

18:57.740 --> 18:59.020
Great,great.

19:02.880 --> 19:03.880
Nice work,chuck.

19:04.100 --> 19:05.940
We know when and where
the package is coming.

19:06.200 --> 19:07.480
Mission accomplished.

19:08.670 --> 19:09.600
How was the date?

19:10.820 --> 19:14.010
Is it me,or does our government
never want me to have sex again?

19:17.010 --> 19:17.810
Second message.

19:17.810 --> 19:19.090
Look,i totally screwed up,okay?

19:19.090 --> 19:25.040
I'm more than comfortable blaming
it on the alcohol,or global warming or
my obscure allergy to neon...

19:25.040 --> 19:27.340
But,hey,hopefully,i'll-i'll talk to you soon.

19:27.340 --> 19:28.130
Okay.Thanks.

19:28.130 --> 19:28.870
Buh-bye.

19:29.620 --> 19:31.390
Damn it.You made me give her a buh-bye.

19:31.490 --> 19:32.750
She won't talk to you?

19:32.850 --> 19:34.540
You want us to cut her power,
smoke her out?

19:34.540 --> 19:35.980
Wow.That's very romantic.

19:35.980 --> 19:38.630
Why don't you just club her over the
head and drag her out by her foot?

19:38.910 --> 19:41.130
Look,i'll handle this one without the nsa,thank you.

19:41.300 --> 19:42.350
You did a good job last night.

19:42.350 --> 19:44.760
We're going down to the docks a few
hours to intercept the package.

19:44.760 --> 19:45.580
You need me to go?

19:46.150 --> 19:48.880
Yeah,if the crap hits the fan,we could
use you,chicken neck.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.490
chuck!Chuck!

19:51.650 --> 19:52.400
What did you hear about last night?

19:52.400 --> 19:53.340
And don't hold back.

19:53.540 --> 19:54.610
I don't know what you're talking about.

19:54.930 --> 19:57.630
I made a move on anna, and she
shot me down, so, i...

19:57.630 --> 19:59.940
What?What?Anna?Anna?Really?
I didn't know you liked anna.

19:59.940 --> 20:01.150
What's like got to do with it?

20:01.150 --> 20:02.940
I figured you have a girl,
i should have a girl, too.

20:02.940 --> 20:08.930
Uh, occasionally, on planet earth,
men will consider their feelings for a
woman before jumping atop them.

20:08.930 --> 20:13.430
You know, she's kind of cute in a freaky,
little tigerish kind of way, you know?

20:14.470 --> 20:15.710
But that's not my problem, dude.

20:15.710 --> 20:16.850
Okay, what if she tells everyone?

20:16.850 --> 20:18.560
I was just starting to get some
street cred around here.

20:18.560 --> 20:19.870
Anna is very cool.

20:19.870 --> 20:22.680
I'm sure that your rep is very secure, ese.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.200
No.They're talking about me.

20:27.200 --> 20:29.320
You see this?
I'm-i'm ruined, dude.

20:29.670 --> 20:31.520
Okay, you got me!

20:33.710 --> 20:35.060
Fun time at my expense.

20:35.060 --> 20:36.830
Look, i tried to kiss anna.

20:36.830 --> 20:38.390
She dissed me, all right?

20:40.310 --> 20:41.910
I feel like a fool.

20:42.590 --> 20:43.490
Are you happy now?

20:44.600 --> 20:49.960
Morgan, we were laughing about
chuck getting dumped by the deli girl
after he dumped the wiener girl.

20:52.020 --> 20:52.930
Kind of poetic?

20:54.060 --> 20:55.460
You tried to kiss anna?

20:56.040 --> 20:56.560
Why?

20:56.560 --> 20:57.730
Dude, how could you?

20:57.730 --> 20:58.930
I got dibs on anna.

20:58.930 --> 21:01.100
I'm right here, you disgusting pig!

21:05.570 --> 21:09.410
I realize that this is dangerously close to
bordering on stalker status,

21:09.410 --> 21:12.280
but, uh, look, i-i don't really care about that.

21:12.630 --> 21:14.530
Look, maybe-maybe you're...
Maybe you're calling me right now.

21:14.530 --> 21:17.010
I don't know.
And just give you the chance to...

21:18.000 --> 21:20.100
Okay, okay.Um, so, uh, you know, if you...

21:20.100 --> 21:23.500
If you get a sec, you can...
You can call me back.Okay.Buh-bye.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.090
Won't call you back?

21:26.920 --> 21:29.320
I, uh...
Yeah, i think her voice-mail is broken.

21:29.970 --> 21:31.410
It's very, very common.

21:32.100 --> 21:33.880
I wanted to apologize for last night.

21:33.880 --> 21:37.780
I suppose i jumped the gun a little,
and i didn't mean to interfere with your date.

21:37.780 --> 21:42.200
Yeah, not sure it qualifies as a date
when you're bugged with cia mrophones

21:42.200 --> 21:45.210
and infiltrating an arms importer,
but, hey, i'm new at this.

21:45.730 --> 21:48.660
Well, it's hard to have a real
relationship in this line of work.

21:49.330 --> 21:51.890
Apparently, it's hard to have a
fake one, as well.

21:56.210 --> 22:00.850
Well, if it's any conciliation, i never
felt like our time together was work.

22:03.460 --> 22:06.250
Oh, uh, gerber daises.
Lou's favorite.

22:06.460 --> 22:07.370
How do you know that?

22:07.790 --> 22:08.310
Cia.

22:08.310 --> 22:11.780
I had them check flower deliveries to her
addresses from the last five years.

22:13.320 --> 22:13.940
Good tip.

22:23.670 --> 22:25.660
Wait, wait.Lou, can i talk to
you just one second?One second?

22:26.170 --> 22:26.870
I'm busy.

22:27.350 --> 22:28.830
Uh, who had the parma prosciutto?

22:29.640 --> 22:30.330
There you go.

22:31.540 --> 22:32.480
Twenty-seven!

22:34.070 --> 22:36.030
You want to talk,
get a number like everybody else.

22:36.580 --> 22:37.420
Man: who's got 28?

22:42.230 --> 22:45.420
Who's holding 29?
29!Twenty-nine!

22:57.660 --> 22:59.090
Federal agent!
Down on the ground!

22:59.090 --> 22:59.720
Don't move!

23:01.960 --> 23:03.120
Get the bomb squad in here!

23:03.770 --> 23:04.610
Let's go!

23:15.760 --> 23:20.460
- 44!Who's holding 44?44?
- 44!I have 44.Yes, yes, yes, yes!

23:20.460 --> 23:22.000
Please, i'd like to speak to lou, please.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.390
Well, buddy, it looks like you're
gonna have to te another number.

23:26.950 --> 23:28.800
45, who's got 45?

23:47.880 --> 23:48.970
You sure thas a good idea?

23:49.900 --> 23:50.690
Yeah, why not?

23:51.310 --> 23:52.700
If it's a bomb in there, we're all gonna go.

23:53.150 --> 23:54.740
Might as well enjoy a last smoke.

24:01.000 --> 24:01.840
It's all clear!

24:02.600 --> 24:04.630
Agent casey, you better take a look at this.

24:08.500 --> 24:09.150
What the hell...

24:10.130 --> 24:11.510
Sarah: someone knew we were coming.

24:17.900 --> 24:20.500
96?
Anybody got 96?

24:25.800 --> 24:28.900
I just wanted to apologize about
last night and explain...

24:28.900 --> 24:30.690
I'm working.Do you want a sandwich?

24:32.630 --> 24:36.550
- Yeah.I'll take a sandwich.x
- Great.What'll you have?

24:36.570 --> 24:37.490
You guys carry wheat bread?

24:37.490 --> 24:37.990
We do.

24:37.990 --> 24:39.310
Why don't you grab a couple slices of that?

24:43.720 --> 24:45.500
Now, toss 'em and grab the seedless rye.

24:46.030 --> 24:47.920
And while you're at it, grab some pastrami.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.740
End cut, none of that lean crap.

24:49.740 --> 24:52.330
A man with high cholesterol.Se.

24:52.330 --> 24:53.010
Is that it?

24:53.010 --> 24:54.510
Oh, i'm just getting warmed up.

24:54.510 --> 24:55.240
Cole slaw.

24:55.240 --> 24:55.830
On the side?

24:55.830 --> 24:57.090
On the top, lather it on.

24:57.090 --> 24:57.890
Swiss?

25:00.070 --> 25:00.820
Muenster.

25:00.820 --> 25:01.550
Is that it?

25:01.550 --> 25:06.800
Well, after you shut itdown and gril this
is a hot sandwich, sweetheart.
In the reuben family.

25:13.410 --> 25:14.390
These are for you.

25:15.460 --> 25:17.010
They were alive at one point.

25:19.350 --> 25:21.200
Gerber daisies, they're my favorite.

25:21.200 --> 25:23.240
I'm really sorry if i acted like a jerk last night.

25:23.240 --> 25:24.330
I was really nervous...

25:24.330 --> 25:25.220
Shut up, chuck.

25:29.340 --> 25:30.660
He had me at "pastrami.

25:40.460 --> 25:41.560
" who are these people?

25:41.560 --> 25:43.410
How did they find out about the shipment?

25:43.410 --> 25:44.430
I have no idea.

25:46.120 --> 25:48.940
If anything goes wrong with this
shipment, we are dead.

25:48.940 --> 25:50.170
Katalabaini, stavros?

25:50.170 --> 25:51.230
These people will kill us.

25:51.230 --> 25:53.310
What the hell is coming in that's
so important, eh?

25:53.310 --> 25:55.570
I don't know and i don't want to know.

25:55.570 --> 25:59.010
Our job is to make the delivery,
not ask questions.

25:59.990 --> 26:04.310
Now, you find out who this belongs to
and bring him to me.

26:16.480 --> 26:17.230
Morning, handsome.

26:18.420 --> 26:19.480
Nice work last night.

26:19.910 --> 26:20.510
Casey: hey, lover boy.

26:21.110 --> 26:22.940
Hasn't that mirror suffered enough already?

26:23.170 --> 26:24.400
I am in the bathroom.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.920
Okay, is there nothing sacred to you people?

26:26.920 --> 26:28.360
Just the right to bear arms.

26:31.230 --> 26:32.300
You two look terrible.

26:33.570 --> 26:35.510
Well, we were up all night
explaining to our bosses

26:35.510 --> 26:39.500
why we raided a cargo freighter
filled with nothing but air and a
surveillance camera.

26:40.070 --> 26:42.120
The tip you gave us was compromised.

26:42.120 --> 26:43.190
Someone set us up.

26:43.190 --> 26:44.610
I think it was your sandwich maker.

26:46.900 --> 26:49.070
Are you kidding me, lou?
Please.Come on.

26:49.070 --> 26:52.480
You don't want me to date for
"national security" reasons, fine, just say that.

26:52.480 --> 26:54.030
But i think this is a little pathetic.

26:54.030 --> 26:55.650
And quite frankly, beneath you, sarah.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.590
This was taken at the docks after your date.

27:05.640 --> 27:08.340
I'm sure she has a perfectly
reasonable explanation for this.

27:08.340 --> 27:08.860
Good.

27:08.860 --> 27:10.220
Can't wait to hear it.

27:11.820 --> 27:12.550
Keep it.

27:12.780 --> 27:14.060
We have plenty more.

27:19.360 --> 27:22.040
Everyone in the mall's talking about
you trying to hook up with anna.

27:22.040 --> 27:25.190
Dude, the guys at the sbarro even
named a pizza after you.

27:25.190 --> 27:28.970
No sauce, no toppings, nothing but pure cheese.
It's called "the loser.

27:28.970 --> 27:30.170
" hmm, let's grab a slice.

27:32.590 --> 27:33.290
I'm ruined.

27:40.850 --> 27:43.920
Casey: okay, chuck, our intel says lou
should be meeting stavros behind the club.

27:44.540 --> 27:45.990
Chuck: you guys are being paranoid.

27:45.990 --> 27:47.470
There's no way lou's showing up here.

27:47.470 --> 27:48.500
Now you're mic'ed.

27:50.170 --> 27:52.840
Great.
Great, thanks a lot.

27:53.180 --> 27:56.460
And what will the sandwich police be doing
on this stakeout?

27:58.710 --> 28:00.200
Here we go.
We got company.xx

28:11.520 --> 28:12.270
Casey: believe us now?

28:14.640 --> 28:15.230
No.

28:15.230 --> 28:17.100
As a matter of fact, i don't.

28:17.100 --> 28:17.910
Hey, chuck, wait...

28:18.370 --> 28:19.570
No, wait.No, damn it.
I'm going after him.x

28:19.570 --> 28:20.600
They have us on tape.

28:21.340 --> 28:23.720
They recognize either of us, we could
blow the whole operation.

28:28.350 --> 28:29.430
Thank you, stavros.

28:29.430 --> 28:30.530
Oh, my pleasure.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.890
So your friend, chuck,
where'd you meet him?

28:33.890 --> 28:36.560
He works at the buy more,
across from the deli.

28:36.560 --> 28:37.810
I took my phone in to get fixed.

28:38.520 --> 28:39.020
Why?

28:40.540 --> 28:41.910
Just seems like a great guy.

28:42.600 --> 28:43.740
I'll be back with the rest.

28:48.300 --> 28:49.080
Well, hello, lou.

28:49.080 --> 28:50.670
If that is in fact your real name.

28:50.670 --> 28:52.250
Chuck, what are you doing here?

28:52.250 --> 28:54.160
I think the question is
what are you doing here?

28:54.160 --> 28:55.250
None of your business.

28:55.250 --> 28:56.540
Were you following me?

28:57.020 --> 28:58.280
Have you been spying on me?

28:58.280 --> 29:00.660
Hold on a second, don't try and
turn this around on me.

29:00.660 --> 29:02.660
Okay, i'm not the one--
i'm not the one smuggling...

29:02.660 --> 29:07.270
You know, what is this?What is this?
Illegal, illegal things with my boyfriend.

29:13.870 --> 29:15.340
Is that-- what is, what is that?

29:15.340 --> 29:17.160
Portuguese cured sopresseto?

29:17.380 --> 29:19.200
What'd you think was
going to be in there?

29:20.670 --> 29:23.330
I, uh, i didn't quite know.

29:23.330 --> 29:25.430
I just saw you with stavros and i
suspected the worst.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.240
Right, well, congratulations, chuck.

29:27.240 --> 29:30.430
Your suspicions have been confirmed.
I'm a smuggler.

29:31.800 --> 29:32.700
You should probably keep that down.

29:32.700 --> 29:33.570
Someone'll hear you, okay?

29:33.570 --> 29:34.850
I know it's illegal!

29:34.850 --> 29:36.750
There's no additives or preservatives in it.

29:36.750 --> 29:39.820
It takes ten days to clear customs
and by then it's gone bad.

29:39.820 --> 29:43.930
Okay, don't get me started on the...
????

29:43.930 --> 29:45.380
I can't hear anything.
I'm going in.

29:45.380 --> 29:46.350
No, no, no, give him a minute.

29:46.350 --> 29:47.260
You can't go in every time he breaks a nail.

29:47.260 --> 29:48.850
Just cover the front.

29:53.190 --> 29:55.380
I'm sorry, lou.
I made a really big mistake.

29:55.380 --> 29:56.400
Looks like i did, too.

30:12.830 --> 30:13.430
Hey, what happened?

30:13.800 --> 30:14.470
I blew it...

30:15.420 --> 30:16.010
Again.

30:16.010 --> 30:17.170
Yes, you did, chuck.

30:18.140 --> 30:19.940
You most definitely blew it.

30:29.360 --> 30:30.170
Why did you come in?

30:30.170 --> 30:32.340
I had the situation entirely under control.

30:32.340 --> 30:33.520
Yeah, i can see that.

30:38.990 --> 30:39.870
Damn it.

30:46.820 --> 30:48.740
I assume you have a plan to
get us out of this mess.

30:48.740 --> 30:51.360
Right now casey's tracking your gps
device in your watch.

30:51.360 --> 30:52.980
A swat team will be here any minute.

30:54.370 --> 30:56.130
Yeah, about the watch...

31:01.520 --> 31:02.240
Idiot.

31:02.240 --> 31:04.830
Lou was incriminating herself
and i didn't want her getting into trouble.

31:04.830 --> 31:06.240
Always the romantic, huh, chuck?

31:06.240 --> 31:06.830
Jealous?

31:06.830 --> 31:07.670
It was foolish.

31:07.670 --> 31:11.120
Do you really think the cia is interested
in a deli meat smuggler?

31:11.120 --> 31:13.710
Well, excuse me if i'm not mr.Perfect spy.

31:13.710 --> 31:16.080
We can't all be bryce larkin, now can we?

31:16.080 --> 31:17.000
Who's jealous now?

31:17.000 --> 31:18.750
- Me, jealous of you and bryce?
- Never.

31:18.750 --> 31:19.830
You said everything you want to say?

31:19.830 --> 31:21.110
- More or less.
- Good.

31:21.110 --> 31:21.900
Now, shut up.

31:21.900 --> 31:23.270
You're sucking up all the air.

31:39.550 --> 31:41.610
Sorry i jammed my tongue down your throat.

31:42.180 --> 31:43.280
No worries, morgan.

31:45.350 --> 31:47.260
The lone wolf does it right.

31:47.260 --> 31:49.680
You know, just jump around
from mate to mate.

31:49.680 --> 31:50.790
Never settles down.

31:50.790 --> 31:51.720
This way...

31:52.520 --> 31:53.510
He never gets hurt.

31:54.490 --> 31:57.710
Maybe, but lone wolves are also lonely.

32:21.790 --> 32:23.180
Food and drug administration.

32:25.920 --> 32:26.720
How can i help you?

32:27.790 --> 32:29.860
We know about the illegal meats
you've been importing, miss.

32:30.770 --> 32:34.250
The fda's been running a task force
against the demetrios family for the last few months.

32:34.250 --> 32:36.350
You're going dn for ten to 20 in a federal pen.

32:36.770 --> 32:37.480
For salami?

32:37.480 --> 32:38.240
For guns.

32:38.800 --> 32:41.640
- Guns?
- The demetrios family's been
shipping guns into l.A.

32:41.640 --> 32:44.920
, which means technically we can
nail you for aiding and abetting terrorists.

32:45.400 --> 32:46.780
Or you can help us.

32:49.330 --> 32:50.470
What would i have to do?

32:50.470 --> 32:53.240
Give me the dock number where you're
receiving your shipments from stavros.

32:56.250 --> 32:58.710
- Dock 14b, the northwest pier.
- Thanks.

33:02.120 --> 33:04.900
By the way, miss, your
pastrami is delicious.

33:08.060 --> 33:10.250
Time is of the essence,
so i will cut to the chase.

33:11.670 --> 33:16.100
We have a very important delivery that is about
to be picked up and we need to know
who else knows about it.

33:17.820 --> 33:19.720
- Okay, i'll talk!I'll talk!
- No, chuck!

33:19.720 --> 33:21.540
We, we know all about...

33:21.540 --> 33:25.840
The imported salami and, and,
and, we're cool with it, man.

33:25.840 --> 33:28.360
The real crime is that it's illegal to begin with.

33:28.360 --> 33:31.000
Honestly, there's no need for torture, yari.

33:31.940 --> 33:34.440
Mr.Bartowski, i'm not going to torture you.

33:34.440 --> 33:36.310
Great.Great, we're on the same page.

33:36.540 --> 33:37.540
I'm going to torture her.

33:37.540 --> 33:38.410
No, no, no, no, no, no.

33:38.410 --> 33:40.960
We're not on the same page anymore, yari,
we're not even in the same chapter.

33:40.960 --> 33:42.000
No, no, no, please don't!

33:46.710 --> 33:48.950
You killed a whole family outside yerevan.

33:49.540 --> 33:52.530
You stole their heirlooms, and you sold
all of them on the russian black market
except for that watch.

33:52.530 --> 33:53.390
How do you know that?

33:59.090 --> 34:00.220
Your name is vladimir snell.

34:00.730 --> 34:03.680
Last year, you were paid $40,000 to kill
a man named leo koloff.

34:04.670 --> 34:06.190
You told me we were paid 20.

34:06.340 --> 34:08.630
He's lying.
He'll say anything to get out of trouble.

34:08.630 --> 34:09.920
He knows about yerevan.

34:09.920 --> 34:11.070
He knows everything.

34:11.870 --> 34:12.620
And you...

34:13.380 --> 34:14.400
Owe me money.

34:18.010 --> 34:19.230
Well, that settles that.

34:19.659 --> 34:20.159
So...

34:20.620 --> 34:23.100
If you will kindly tell me
who else knows about our shipment.

34:23.100 --> 34:24.100
Man: the package is here.

34:25.889 --> 34:26.850
Berth 19.

34:26.850 --> 34:28.850
We've got five minutes till it expires, sir.

34:32.989 --> 34:34.650
All right, let's go.

34:35.639 --> 34:36.940
We'll just have to kill them.

34:39.679 --> 34:41.159
Chuck: there's a weapon in the shipment.

34:41.159 --> 34:41.969
I think it's some kind of chemical bomb.

34:41.969 --> 34:43.580
We have to get to it before it blows.

35:01.710 --> 35:02.520
I'll hold the fort.

35:02.520 --> 35:03.950
You go get the bomb-- go!

35:06.900 --> 35:08.130
Sarah: the bomb's at berth 19.

35:08.130 --> 35:09.890
Chuck, i want you to get a
s far away from here as possible.

35:09.890 --> 35:11.050
-I'm coming with you.
-No.Chuck.

35:11.050 --> 35:13.150
You're not going anywhere near a live bomb.

35:13.150 --> 35:14.200
Do you know how to diffuse a bomb?

35:14.200 --> 35:15.440
Do you have an intersect in your head?

35:15.440 --> 35:16.270
I didn't think so.

35:16.270 --> 35:17.920
Hey!Chuck!
Wait!

35:31.240 --> 35:33.050
Go, dad, go!

35:42.960 --> 35:44.350
Go, dad, go!

35:55.290 --> 35:56.760
It's over, yari.Drop the weapon.

35:58.000 --> 35:58.720
Okay.
You got me.

36:08.610 --> 36:09.570
It's tommy.

36:09.950 --> 36:10.830
We have a problem.

36:11.280 --> 36:13.850
Thpackage has been intercepted.
We're going to have to clean things up.

36:20.590 --> 36:21.090
Here.

36:21.400 --> 36:22.000
Help me out.

36:46.510 --> 36:48.760
Okay...
Okay, intersect.

36:49.530 --> 36:50.270
Flash.

36:50.760 --> 36:51.830
Show me how to do this.

36:52.970 --> 36:53.710
Did you flash?

36:53.710 --> 36:54.680
No.
Nothing.

36:54.970 --> 36:55.670
Come on!

36:55.670 --> 36:58.080
Come on, come on, come on,
baby, don't fail me now.

36:58.080 --> 37:00.070
Okay, chuck, that's enough.Run
.I'm going to try and stay and defuse it.

37:00.070 --> 37:01.480
No, i'm not leaving you.

37:01.480 --> 37:02.980
Go.That is an order.

37:02.980 --> 37:04.340
No.

37:06.150 --> 37:07.300
I said go.

37:07.300 --> 37:08.430
Oh, see.

37:08.430 --> 37:10.440
So you're going to shoot me to
prevent me from getting blown up?

37:10.440 --> 37:11.400
That's a great plan.

37:11.400 --> 37:12.590
Why are you so stubborn?

37:12.590 --> 37:14.540
Actually, i consider this a
rare moment of courage.

37:14.540 --> 37:17.230
I don't know where it's coming from,
i guess you just bring out the worst in me.

37:17.230 --> 37:18.520
And you in me.

37:24.070 --> 37:25.190
It was nice knowing you.

37:55.850 --> 37:57.310
Well, the good news is, we're alive.

37:59.390 --> 38:01.580
And the bad news is that this is kind of...

38:01.980 --> 38:03.870
An uncomfortable moment right now.

38:05.560 --> 38:07.870
It's completely comfortable on my end.

38:09.520 --> 38:10.340
Just saying.

38:19.710 --> 38:20.270
* hey yeah * * under the sun * * you will find me *
* under the sun * * nothing but blue skies
* select ingredients combine for sophisticated
flavours, like sun-dried tomato.

38:24.110 --> 38:24.740
Look, i...

38:24.740 --> 38:27.460
I know that you are so sick of hearing this,

38:27.460 --> 38:32.760
but i'm really sorry if i've acted like a jerk.

38:33.250 --> 38:35.630
Chuck, i know who you really work for.

38:37.210 --> 38:39.000
That you're an undercover agent.

38:41.320 --> 38:42.210
How do you...

38:42.210 --> 38:44.900
That guy casey from the food
and drug administration came to see me,

38:45.280 --> 38:47.280
explained that you are an informant.

38:47.740 --> 38:50.070
Righ my cover has been blown.

38:50.410 --> 38:51.970
I'm an agent for the fda.

38:52.140 --> 38:55.490
Can i ask you a question?

38:56.100 --> 38:58.910
This whole time, did you ever really like me?

38:58.910 --> 38:59.650
Honestly?

38:59.650 --> 39:00.150
Yeah.

39:00.740 --> 39:04.350
Let's try that for the first time since we've met.

39:04.350 --> 39:06.740
Lou, you are everything that i'm looking for.

39:09.480 --> 39:11.040
I just can't look right now.

39:12.710 --> 39:13.300
Well...

39:13.300 --> 39:15.380
Thank you for being honest.

39:16.800 --> 39:19.160
The next time my phone breaks,
i'm going to the large mart.

39:19.160 --> 39:21.300
Oh, that...That hurts.

39:21.300 --> 39:22.720
And the next time that you're hungry...

39:22.720 --> 39:23.530
No, no, no, no.

39:23.530 --> 39:24.840
Take it to the wienerlicious.

39:26.410 --> 39:28.300
I'm really going to miss the chuck bartowski.

39:29.660 --> 39:30.690
So am i.

39:33.140 --> 39:33.750
Hey, lou.

39:35.010 --> 39:35.560
Yeah?

39:36.520 --> 39:37.370
I'm sorry.

39:37.830 --> 39:38.650
Don't be.

39:39.120 --> 39:43.590
Secret agent or no that was
the best kiss i've had in a long time.

39:50.690 --> 39:53.050
Hey, morgan, can i borrow a pen?

39:54.580 --> 39:55.780
He is so whipped.

39:55.780 --> 39:57.300
Pathetic.
Ridiculous.

39:58.350 --> 39:58.940
Whipped?

40:00.420 --> 40:02.130
Oh, yeah, i got a girlfriend now, chuck.

40:03.250 --> 40:04.080
Anna?

40:04.590 --> 40:06.340
She couldn't resist my animal magnetism.

40:07.530 --> 40:10.160
I almost feel bad for the kid.
She never stood a chance, you know?

40:10.960 --> 40:12.620
Anyway...
Hey!

40:12.980 --> 40:15.090
You and lou, this friday, we'll double date.

40:15.770 --> 40:16.890
Lou and i broke up.

40:16.890 --> 40:17.710
What?

40:17.710 --> 40:18.800
You're a free man?

40:21.020 --> 40:21.640
Anna.

40:22.040 --> 40:23.870
Hey, listen, it's, uh, it's morgan.

40:24.250 --> 40:25.060
It's over.

40:25.060 --> 40:29.400
We had a good run, but, uh,
lone wolf has to run free.Okay?

40:30.200 --> 40:31.440
Chuck and morgan train is on...

40:31.440 --> 40:33.520
Track.Track.Track.

40:33.710 --> 40:35.730
Yeah, not really, though, 'cause, uh...

40:36.280 --> 40:38.300
I'm going to get back together with sarah i think.

40:38.300 --> 40:39.960
You couldn't say this ten seconds ago, huh?

40:41.230 --> 40:41.860
Anna.

40:42.480 --> 40:43.370
Honey?

40:43.720 --> 40:44.390
Sweetie.

40:55.110 --> 40:57.520
Whoever shot yari was here
to pick up this package.

40:57.810 --> 40:59.570
Someone who didn't want yari to talk.

41:05.860 --> 41:06.620
All clear.

41:07.570 --> 41:09.110
Looks mean, but it's nonlethal.

41:09.490 --> 41:12.630
That timer wasn't a fuse,
it was measuring an oxygen supply.

41:30.230 --> 41:32.080
This is sarah.
Please leave a message.

41:32.740 --> 41:33.930
Hi, it's chuck.

41:34.280 --> 41:36.230
Of course, it's me, it's me, it's chuck.

41:36.580 --> 41:39.290
Look, i-i was just wondering if
you wanted to go out on a date tonight.

41:41.740 --> 41:47.220
And by "date" i mean no gps and no
mikes and no chaperos-- it'd just be us.

41:55.150 --> 41:56.720
Oh, my god, bryce.

41:57.780 --> 41:58.690
Didn't i kill him?

42:04.160 --> 42:06.230
I'm thinking maybe we could hit up sbarro.

42:06.720 --> 42:12.080
They just named a new pizza after morgan,
and, uh, you know, i kind of wanted to support him.

42:13.980 --> 42:14.730
So...

42:15.550 --> 42:16.360
Okay.

42:17.620 --> 42:18.450
Bye.
