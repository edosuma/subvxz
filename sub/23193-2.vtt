WEBVTT

00:09.410 --> 00:10.878
- LIFE--IT'S LITERALLY
ALL WE HAVE.

00:10.911 --> 00:12.846
BUT IS IT ANY GOOD?

00:12.880 --> 00:15.683
I'M A REVIEWER, BUT I DON'T
REVIEW FOOD, BOOKS, OR MOVIES.

00:15.716 --> 00:17.685
I REVIEW LIFE ITSELF.

00:17.718 --> 00:20.020
VIVA LA REVOLUCION!

00:20.054 --> 00:23.224
[cheering]

00:23.257 --> 00:25.659
[Taser crackling]
AAH! AAH!

00:25.693 --> 00:28.662
[fanfare playing]

00:28.696 --> 00:33.667
*

00:33.701 --> 00:35.503
HELLO, AND WELCOME TO REVIEW.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.606
I'M FORREST MACNEIL,
AND TONIGHT WE SHALL CONTINUE

00:38.639 --> 00:41.842
OUR EXPLORATION OF THE ADVENTURE
THAT IS LIFE.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.744
WHATEVER EXPERIENCE
YOU'RE CURIOUS ABOUT,

00:43.777 --> 00:46.247
I WILL DO IT AND REVIEW IT.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.916
AND I'M NOT ALONE.
I'VE BEEN PAIRED WITH A CO-HOST.

00:48.949 --> 00:51.785
HERE TO FIELD YOUR INQUIRIES
IS A.J. GIBBS.

00:51.819 --> 00:53.354
- YOU READY, FORREST?

00:53.387 --> 00:54.422
- I AM READY.
LET'S GO!

00:54.455 --> 00:55.789
- OKAY!
- [chuckles]

00:55.823 --> 00:57.858
- FROM ANGELA IN SEATTLE,
WASHINGTON, D.C.

00:57.891 --> 01:01.462
- UH, WELL--
- HELLO, FORREST, HOW ARE YOU?

01:01.495 --> 01:03.431
WE BOUGHT OUR HOUSE
FROM THE ESTATE OF A COUPLE

01:03.464 --> 01:05.999
WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE,
AND IN THE ATTIC,

01:06.033 --> 01:09.437
WE FOUND THIS VIDEOTAPE
OF THEM HAVING SEX.

01:09.470 --> 01:11.339
I GUESS MY QUESTION IS,

01:11.372 --> 01:14.875
WHY WOULD ANYONE FILM THEMSELVES
DOING THAT?

01:14.908 --> 01:17.145
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

01:17.145 --> 01:18.646
- A VERY POLITE YOUNG LADY.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.814
- HMM, WHO WANTS TO KNOW WHAT
IT'S LIKE

01:20.848 --> 01:23.151
TO MAKE A SEXUALLY EXPLICIT
VIDEOTAPE.

01:23.184 --> 01:25.819
- DON'T TELL ME YOU'VE NEVER
DONE THAT BEFORE, FORREST, OKAY?

01:25.853 --> 01:28.055
THE MOST BUTTONED-UP GUYS--
THEY ARE ALWAYS THE FREAKIEST.

01:28.156 --> 01:30.324
- NO, NO, MY WIFE AND I HAVE...
[clears throat]

01:30.358 --> 01:33.361
NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THAT,
BUT I SUPPOSE WE'RE ABOUT TO.

01:33.394 --> 01:35.062
- WORD OF ADVICE?
- YES.

01:35.163 --> 01:36.530
- DON'T FORGET TO TAKE
THE LENS CAP OFF THE CAMERA,

01:36.564 --> 01:38.332
OTHERWISE YOU MAY FIND

01:38.366 --> 01:41.001
THAT YOU'RE HAVING SEX
WITH YOUR WIFE FOR NO REASON.

01:41.034 --> 01:43.571
- YES, THANK YOU.
THAT'S HELPFUL.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.173
THE SEX TAPE--

01:45.173 --> 01:48.909
LET'S FIND OUT
WHAT THAT'S ALL ABOUT.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.844
THIS REVIEW WOULD REQUIRE ME
TO TEST

01:50.878 --> 01:54.081
THE LIMITS OF MY INHIBITIONS
IN THE INTEREST OF HUMANITY,

01:54.182 --> 01:56.384
AND THERE WAS NO TIME
FOR SIT-UPS.

01:58.386 --> 02:01.255
TO UNDERSTAND THE HOWS
AND WHYS OF THE SEX TAPE,

02:01.289 --> 02:03.891
I ASKED MY INTERN TO COMPILE
THE ESSENTIALS OF THE GENRE.

02:03.924 --> 02:05.993
- SO, UH, 1 NIGHT IN PARIS.

02:06.026 --> 02:08.196
THIS IS KIND OF LIKE
THE APOCALYPSE NOW

02:08.196 --> 02:09.663
OF CELEBRITY SEX TAPES.

02:09.697 --> 02:11.999
THEN YOU'VE GOT PAMELA ANDERSON
AND TOMMY LEE,

02:12.032 --> 02:15.936
WHICH IS KIND OF LIKE
THE CITIZEN KANE, I GUESS?

02:15.969 --> 02:18.572
- WAIT, WAIT.
TURN ON YOUR FILTER LIGHT.

02:18.606 --> 02:21.209
- IN SHORT ORDER,
THE HOW WAS CLEAR ENOUGH--

02:21.209 --> 02:24.345
DIRTY TALK
AND CONFUSING SEXUAL POSITIONS--

02:24.378 --> 02:26.414
BUT THE WHY REMAINED ELUSIVE.

02:26.447 --> 02:27.981
THAT IS DISGUSTING.

02:28.015 --> 02:29.350
THERE'S A VERY GOOD REASON

02:29.383 --> 02:31.519
THAT MOST PEOPLE HAVE SEX
IN THE DARK.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.454
IT FEELS BETTER THAN IT LOOKS.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.655
THANK YOU, LUCILLE.
- OH.

02:34.688 --> 02:36.857
TAKE IT!
- ROB LOWE, HUH?

02:36.890 --> 02:39.427
[indistinct chatter
on computer]

02:39.460 --> 02:41.362
- IT SIMPLY DIDN'T MAKE SENSE
TO ME.

02:41.395 --> 02:42.830
JUST BREAKS MY HEART HOW--
- CAN WE NOT TALK?

02:42.863 --> 02:44.332
I REALLY JUST WANT TO FOCUS
ON THIS.

02:44.365 --> 02:45.966
- OH, YEAH

02:45.999 --> 02:47.601
- OKAY.

02:47.635 --> 02:50.238
IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND
THE APPEAL OF MAKING A SEX TAPE,

02:50.238 --> 02:53.241
I WAS GOING TO NEED THE
ASSISTANCE OF A WILLING PARTNER.

02:53.241 --> 02:55.643
- HAVE YOU OUTDONE YOURSELF?
- I THINK I HAVE OUTDONE MYSELF.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.478
ASK ME WHY I MADE
MY SPECIALTY TONIGHT.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.513
- WHY DID YOU MAKE
YOUR SPECIALTY TONIGHT, HONEY?

02:59.547 --> 03:03.551
- WELL, JUST FOR THE HALIBUT.
[both laughing]

03:03.584 --> 03:06.954
THAT'S A LOT OF FUN.
- THAT IS A LOT OF FUN.

03:06.987 --> 03:11.259
- TO US.
- TO US. MM.

03:11.259 --> 03:12.793
both: MMM.

03:12.826 --> 03:15.696
- HEY, LISTEN, I TOLD ERIC
THAT HE SHOULD STAY OVER

03:15.729 --> 03:17.931
AT CLAYTON'S HOUSE TONIGHT.
- OH, OKAY.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.867
I HAVE A SHOPPING LIST FOR YOU,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.435
- SHOPPING LIST?
NO, NO, NO.

03:21.469 --> 03:22.970
NO, I THOUGHT
WE MIGHT DO SOMETHING

03:23.003 --> 03:25.138
A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING
WITH OUR ALONE TIME.

03:25.172 --> 03:27.808
- OH, OKAY, I GET IT, YEAH.
- UH-HUH, YEAH.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.142
IN FACT, I THOUGHT WE MIGHT...
- OH, ALL RIGHT.

03:29.176 --> 03:30.811
- MIX IT UP
A LITTLE BIT TONIGHT.

03:30.844 --> 03:34.315
- WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
- I WAS THINKING WE MIGHT

03:34.348 --> 03:37.485
DOCUMENT THE PROCEEDINGS
CE SOIR--

03:37.518 --> 03:39.487
TONIGHT.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

03:39.520 --> 03:41.054
- HMM?
- HOW--HOW WOULD WE--

03:41.088 --> 03:43.457
- I BOUGHT A VIDEO CAMERA,
AND I THOUGHT WE COULD--

03:43.491 --> 03:45.393
- UGH!
YOU WANT TO MAKE A SEX TAPE?

03:45.426 --> 03:46.760
- YEAH!
- NO, GROSS!

03:46.794 --> 03:48.061
- WHY?

03:48.095 --> 03:49.463
- WHAT ARE YOU,
A FRESHMAN IN COLLEGE?

03:49.497 --> 03:51.732
NO, NO, NO.
WHAT IF PEOPLE SAW IT?

03:51.765 --> 03:53.401
WHAT IF ERIC FOUND IT?
- NO, DON'T--

03:53.434 --> 03:55.068
SWEETHEART, WE'LL MAKE SURE ERIC
DOESN'T SEE IT

03:55.102 --> 03:57.305
UNTIL LONG AFTER WE'RE DEAD.
- NO, THAT IS NOT--

03:57.338 --> 03:59.172
I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE
YOU WOULD WANT TO DO--

03:59.206 --> 04:00.708
THAT'S NOT LIKE YOU.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.042
IT'S CREEPY.
- I'M VERY SURPRISED

04:02.075 --> 04:03.644
BY THIS REACTION OF YOURS.
- [sighs]

04:03.677 --> 04:05.012
- I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT THINK
IT WOULD BE KIND OF FUN.

04:05.045 --> 04:06.680
- MAN, FORREST.
- I THINK IT WOULD BE FUN.

04:06.714 --> 04:08.382
- YOU WERE SO CLOSE, YOU KNOW?
YOU WERE ON THE GREEN!

04:08.416 --> 04:09.750
ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS
JUST PUTT IT.

04:09.783 --> 04:11.151
- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I WAS DOING.

04:11.184 --> 04:13.421
- NO, YOU SHANKED IT RIGHT
INTO THE WOODS!

04:13.454 --> 04:16.324
THANKS FOR NOTHING, ALL RIGHT?

04:16.324 --> 04:17.658
- WELL, THINK ABOUT IT.

04:17.691 --> 04:20.428
- I THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
NO.

04:20.461 --> 04:23.331
[light switch clicks]

04:23.331 --> 04:26.166
- I'D NEVER EVEN CONSIDERED
BEING UNFAITHFUL TO SUZANNE.

04:26.199 --> 04:28.402
SHE IS MY BEST FRIEND
AND CONFIDANTE,

04:28.436 --> 04:32.172
MY PARTNER IN LIFE.

04:32.205 --> 04:35.242
THOUGH HORRIFIED AND SCANDALIZED
BY THE VERY THOUGHT OF IT,

04:35.343 --> 04:37.345
I WOULD HAVE TO MAKE MY TAPE...

04:37.345 --> 04:39.347
SAY HELLO TO YOUR FOLKS.
- BYE.

04:39.347 --> 04:41.349
- WITHOUT SUZANNE.

04:43.417 --> 04:46.387
[soft rock music]

04:46.420 --> 04:54.428
*

05:00.634 --> 05:04.104
HER NAME
WAS KATRINA SERIES 3,

05:04.137 --> 05:07.375
A $4,000, STATE-OF-THE-ART,
SYNTHETIC SEX DOLL.

05:07.375 --> 05:09.710
SHE WAS MADE OF LATEX RUBBER
BUILT AROUND

05:09.743 --> 05:11.812
A HIGHLY POSE-ABLE SKELETON,

05:11.845 --> 05:13.547
AND SHE FEATURED
WHAT I WAS ASSURED

05:13.581 --> 05:17.050
WAS A VERY LIFELIKE,
FIVE-SPEED, VIBRATING VAGINA.

05:17.084 --> 05:20.821
AHH.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.690
YOU READY?

05:22.723 --> 05:24.725
IF KATRINA HAD ANY QUALMS
ABOUT APPEARING

05:24.758 --> 05:26.494
IN A SEX TAPE WITH ME,

05:26.527 --> 05:30.498
SHE KEPT THEM TO HERSELF.

05:30.531 --> 05:32.700
THIS FEELS WEIRD FOR ME TOO.

05:32.733 --> 05:37.505
*

05:37.538 --> 05:40.040
[grunting]

05:40.073 --> 05:43.411
KATRINA'S ALLURING TITANIUM
INFRASTRUCTURE GAVE HER

05:43.411 --> 05:46.980
A WEIGHT OF OVER 100 POUNDS,
AN OBVIOUS DESIGN FLAW,

05:47.014 --> 05:50.050
SINCE THERE'S NO POSSIBLE WAY
I'M THE MOST OUT-OF-SHAPE PERSON

05:50.083 --> 05:51.685
WHO OWNS ONE OF THESE.

05:51.719 --> 05:54.588
BUT SOMEHOW, SHE AND I WOULD
FIND A WAY TO ECSTASY.

05:54.622 --> 05:55.689
OH!

05:55.723 --> 05:58.025
[winces]
OH.

05:58.058 --> 06:01.228
I AM NOT PROUD OF WHAT
YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE.

06:01.261 --> 06:04.465
HELLO, AND WELCOME
TO MY SEX TAPE.

06:11.439 --> 06:14.107
- HELLO, AND WELCOME
TO MY SEX TAPE.

06:17.445 --> 06:21.449
ALL RIGHT.
[clears throat]

06:21.449 --> 06:23.751
[sighs]

06:23.784 --> 06:27.287
I WASTED NO TIME IN PUTTING
MY SEX-TAPE RESEARCH TO WORK,

06:27.320 --> 06:30.290
UNLEASHING A BARRAGE
OF DIRTY SEX TALK.

06:30.323 --> 06:34.127
GOOD EVENING.
HOW ARE YOU?

06:34.161 --> 06:37.631
UH, YOU'RE VERY BEAUTIFUL.

06:37.665 --> 06:41.068
YOUR EYES ARE--ARE JUST, UH...

06:41.101 --> 06:44.705
I WANT YOU TO KNOW, UH...

06:44.738 --> 06:46.239
THIS DOESN'T ALWAYS GO WELL
FOR ME.

06:46.273 --> 06:48.241
I'M GONNA TRY TO PUT YOU
IN A POSITION

06:48.275 --> 06:50.711
THAT'S BEST FOR THE CAMERA.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.613
[grunts]

06:52.646 --> 06:54.982
THERE'S ALMOST NO WAY TO PUT HER
THAT SHE DOESN'T LOOK DEAD.

06:55.015 --> 06:58.218
THIS DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.
OH, GOD!

06:58.251 --> 07:01.655
THIS LEG IS ALL THE WAY--
ALL THE WAY BACK.

07:01.689 --> 07:03.491
[straining]
THIS IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE!

07:03.524 --> 07:05.493
IMPOSSIBLE.
[grunts]

07:05.493 --> 07:07.060
UNLIKE
PROFESSIONAL PORNOGRAPHY,

07:07.094 --> 07:09.229
SEX TAPES ARE SUPPOSED
TO LOOK TERRIBLE.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.631
OH, NO.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.966
SORRY ABOUT THAT, MY DARLING.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.636
[phone ringing]
OH, GOD.

07:15.669 --> 07:18.639
[pop music]

07:18.672 --> 07:21.809

07:21.842 --> 07:24.645
YEAH, MACNEIL RESIDENCE.
- OH, HEY, FORREST.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.580
- OH, HI, SUZANNE.
YES, HELLO.

07:26.614 --> 07:28.315
- I THOUGHT FOR A SECOND
I MIGHT HAVE LEFT THE OVEN ON.

07:28.348 --> 07:29.917
NO.
WELL, SAY HELLO TO YOUR PARENTS.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.418
- OKAY.
- MM-HMM.

07:31.519 --> 07:33.386
- LOVE YOU.
I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

07:33.420 --> 07:35.856
- [sighs]

07:35.889 --> 07:38.926
*

07:38.959 --> 07:40.728
THAT WAS A WORK THING.

07:40.761 --> 07:43.531
EVENTUALLY, MY PHYSICAL PLEASURE
AND THE SPEED

07:43.531 --> 07:45.933
OF KATRINA'S VAGINA
INTENSIFIED,

07:45.966 --> 07:48.736
AND MY AWARENESS OF THE CAMERA
FELL AWAY COMPLETELY.

07:48.769 --> 07:51.371
[snoring]
AND THEN MY AWARENESS

07:51.404 --> 07:55.008
OF EVERYTHING FELL AWAY, AS
I SURRENDERED TO THE HEAVY SLEEP

07:55.042 --> 07:57.611
OF THE SEXUALLY SATISFIED MAN.

07:57.645 --> 08:00.948
I HAD OVERCOME GREAT FEARS
TO MAKE WHAT I HOPED

08:00.981 --> 08:03.283
WAS THE TITANIC OF SEX TAPES.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.819
- FORREST?

08:05.853 --> 08:08.689
DID YOU DRINK A HALF A BOTTLE
OF MY BRANDY?

08:08.722 --> 08:09.990
- OH, SUZANNE.
- OH, MY GOD!

08:10.023 --> 08:12.025
- OH, OKAY--UH, OH.
- WHO IS THAT?

08:12.059 --> 08:13.994
- THAT IS NOBODY.
THAT IS LITERALLY NOBODY.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.563
- HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO US?
- NO, I'M SERIOUS,

08:15.563 --> 08:17.164
THAT'S NOBODY.
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:17.197 --> 08:18.632
- OH, MY GOD, ERIC,
GO TO CLAYTON'S HOUSE, OKAY?

08:18.666 --> 08:20.333
DADDY IS VERY SICK.
- I HATE THIS FAMILY!

08:20.367 --> 08:22.102
- LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.

08:22.135 --> 08:23.336
- OH, MY GOD, IT'S JUST A DOLL.
- IT'S JUST A DOLL.

08:23.370 --> 08:25.105
- WHAT--[sighs]

08:25.138 --> 08:26.774
THAT'S WHY IT SMELLS
LIKE BURNING SNEAKER IN HERE.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.576
- I KNOW.
- OPEN A [bleep] WINDOW.

08:28.576 --> 08:29.943
- OKAY, SORRY, LOOK--

08:29.977 --> 08:31.011
- WHAT DID YOU THINK
YOU WERE DOING?

08:31.044 --> 08:32.479
OH, GOD.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.181
FORREST, IF I HAD KNOWN
YOU WERE SO DETERMINED

08:34.214 --> 08:35.282
TO MAKE A SEX VIDEO,

08:35.315 --> 08:37.317
I WOULD--I WOULD HAVE DONE IT.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.853
IF YOU NEED TO DO THIS KIND
OF WEIRD [bleep],

08:39.887 --> 08:42.956
THEN I WANT TO BE INVOLVED.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.858
OKAY, I DON'T WANT TO JUDGE.
- REALLY?

08:44.892 --> 08:45.993
I'LL BETCHA IT WOULD BE EVEN
BETTER WITH YOU THAN IT WAS--

08:46.026 --> 08:47.595
- YOU "BETCHA"?

08:47.595 --> 08:49.062
- I--WELL, I--NO, IT--YEAH.
NO, OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.398
OF COURSE IT WOULD.
OF COURSE IT WOULD.

08:51.431 --> 08:54.802
WHATEVER TREPIDATIONS I MIGHT
HAVE HAD ABOUT FILMING IT,

08:54.835 --> 08:58.238
THE FOOTAGE OF ME SHOEHORNING
MYSELF INTO THAT RUBBER LADY

08:58.271 --> 08:59.907
HAS SOMEHOW BECOME
A RELIABLE SOURCE

08:59.940 --> 09:02.242
OF FOREPLAY IN OUR HOUSEHOLD.

09:02.275 --> 09:04.812
SO, IF THE POINT OF MAKING
A SEX TAPE

09:04.845 --> 09:06.479
IS TO SPICE UP YOUR SEX LIFE,

09:06.513 --> 09:09.917
I HAVE TO SAY IT WORKED.

09:09.950 --> 09:13.320
"MAKING A SEX TAPE"--
FOUR STARS.

09:18.125 --> 09:21.662
[fanfare plays]

09:21.695 --> 09:23.263
- ON TO OUR NEXT REVIEW.

09:23.296 --> 09:26.166
- OOH, OUR NEXT REVIEW CAME
TO US IN AN EMAIL...

09:26.199 --> 09:28.168
- MM-HMM.
- FROM "TOOMUCHTANYA2000,"

09:28.201 --> 09:30.270
OH, IN MADISON, WISCONSIN.

09:39.647 --> 09:43.684
- RACISM--A DISLIKE OF OTHERS
JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFERENT.

09:43.717 --> 09:45.285
WELL, I GUESS
I'M GONNA HAVE TO CHANGE

09:45.318 --> 09:49.222
MY OUTLOOK AND BECOME...
A RACIST.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.660
FOR YOU, MY BLACK FRIEND.

09:52.693 --> 09:55.763
BEFORE I EMBARKED ON MY JOURNEY
OF RACE-BASED HATRED,

09:55.796 --> 09:57.865
I PAID A VISIT
TO MY BLACK NEIGHBOR, GENE,

09:57.898 --> 10:01.101
TO BANK SOME GOODWILL
FOR THE DIFFICULT TIMES AHEAD.

10:01.134 --> 10:04.037
I HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT OF
BLACK PEOPLE SIMPLY AS PEOPLE

10:04.071 --> 10:05.605
AND, AS A CONSEQUENCE,

10:05.639 --> 10:07.708
DIDN'T THINK MUCH WAS SPECIAL
ABOUT THEM.

10:07.741 --> 10:09.677
BUT NOW I WOULD NEED
TO DISCOVER WHAT IT WAS

10:09.710 --> 10:11.378
THAT MADE THEM DIFFERENT

10:11.411 --> 10:15.949
AND HOW I COULD TURN THAT
INTO FEELINGS OF RED-HOT RACISM.

10:15.983 --> 10:18.185
AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT,
I STUMBLED UPON A FAMILY REUNION

10:18.218 --> 10:21.689
OF BLACK PEOPLE, WHICH WAS BEING
HELD IN A PUBLIC PARK

10:21.722 --> 10:23.323
WHERE ANYONE COULD JOIN THEM.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.726
HI, THERE.
[chuckles]

10:25.759 --> 10:27.728
- YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO'S RUDE?
CAMERON.

10:27.761 --> 10:31.398
SHE SAYS TO ME, "OH, YOU NEED
TO DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR HAIR."

10:31.431 --> 10:33.667
- [scoffs]
UNBELIEVABLE.

10:33.701 --> 10:36.704
OVER THE COURSE OF A PRODUCTIVE
AND ENJOYABLE AFTERNOON

10:36.737 --> 10:38.505
OF INTERRACIAL EAVESDROPPING,

10:38.538 --> 10:39.973
I LEARNED AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT

10:40.007 --> 10:42.142
OF UNFLATTERING THINGS
ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.977
- WHO INVITED YOU, AGAIN?

10:44.011 --> 10:46.747
- THEY INSULT YOUR HAIR
WHEN THEIR WEAVE LOOKS TERRIBLE,

10:46.780 --> 10:48.148
THEY SHOOT OFF THEIR MOUTHS
TO DERRICK

10:48.181 --> 10:49.883
ABOUT THINGS
THAT DON'T CONCERN THEM,

10:49.917 --> 10:51.852
AND, MOST INFURIATINGLY,

10:51.885 --> 10:54.254
THEY WON'T STOP TALKING
ABOUT THEIR CATERING BUSINESS.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.389
WAS IT DIFFICULT
TO EARN THEIR TRUST?

10:58.191 --> 10:59.827
SO LONG, EVERYBODY!

10:59.860 --> 11:03.764
I NOW HAD THE AMMUNITION
TO GET SERIOUSLY RACIST.

11:03.797 --> 11:07.134
HEY, SHUT UP ABOUT
YOUR CATERING BUSINESS!

11:07.167 --> 11:09.236
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GO!

11:09.269 --> 11:10.437
ACTUALLY, CAN YOU MAKE THAT
A DIET COKE, PLEASE?

11:10.470 --> 11:12.572
I AM WATCHING MY CALORIES,

11:12.605 --> 11:15.743
AND I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA RUN
ALONG AND TELL THAT TO DERRICK.

11:15.743 --> 11:17.610
- DERRICK?

11:17.644 --> 11:19.346
- I KNOW A FEW THINGS.

11:19.379 --> 11:20.748
OH, GOOD.
YES, THANK YOU.

11:20.748 --> 11:22.149
RIGHT NEXT
TO THE OTHER ONE, PLEASE.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.483
IT WAS NECESSARY
FOR MY NEW RACIST ATTITUDE

11:23.516 --> 11:25.352
TO PERVADE MY ENTIRE LIFE,

11:25.385 --> 11:26.619
INCLUDING AT THE WORKPLACE.

11:26.653 --> 11:29.757
ATTENTION, EVERYONE!
NEW POLICY.

11:29.790 --> 11:33.660
THIS WILL BE STRICTLY,
HARSHLY, ENFORCED.

11:33.761 --> 11:35.628
[toilet flushes]
BUT THESE NEW SYSTEMS

11:35.662 --> 11:38.098
WERE DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN
IN THE MODERN WORLD.

11:38.131 --> 11:41.268
I WAS, FOR INSTANCE, NOT ABLE
TO EXPLAIN WHERE WHITE WOMEN

11:41.301 --> 11:43.436
WERE SUPPOSED TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

11:43.470 --> 11:45.138
- [sighs]

11:45.172 --> 11:48.375
- MY EFFORTS WERE CAUSING
MORE CONFUSION THAN OPPRESSION.

11:48.408 --> 11:49.476
- WAIT. THIS ONE IS
THE COLOR COPIER?

11:49.509 --> 11:50.643
ISN'T IT THAT ONE?

11:50.677 --> 11:52.545
- THIS IS THE COLORED COPIER.

11:52.579 --> 11:55.849
THAT ONE IS THE COLOR COPIER.

11:55.883 --> 11:57.785
- SO THIS IS
THE BLACK-AND-WHITE COPIER?

11:57.785 --> 11:59.186
- THAT'S THE WHITE COPIER.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.788
- LOOK, I JUST NEED TO MAKE
A COLOR COPY.

12:00.788 --> 12:02.122
- WELL, GO AHEAD AND DO IT.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.423
JUST DON'T USE
THE COLORED COPIER.

12:03.456 --> 12:05.125
THE WHITE COPIER
IS BETTER ANYWAY.

12:05.158 --> 12:08.061
IT MAKES COLORED COPIES.

12:08.095 --> 12:11.398
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I CAN POSSIBLY
DO TO MAKE THIS MORE CLEAR.

12:11.431 --> 12:14.034
- YOU COULD WRITE "PEOPLE"
UNDER THEM.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.804
- HOWEVER, A VISIT FROM OUR HEAD
OF HUMAN RESOURCES

12:16.804 --> 12:18.906
LET ME KNOW I WAS ON
THE RIGHT TRACK.

12:18.939 --> 12:19.973
HELLO.

12:20.007 --> 12:21.574
- YOU'VE PUT THE ENTIRE COMPANY

12:21.608 --> 12:24.077
IN AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT
SITUATION.

12:24.111 --> 12:26.113
YOU HAVE TO STOP THIS.

12:26.146 --> 12:29.716
- SHARON, WHAT RACE ARE YOU?

12:29.817 --> 12:32.085
- YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO ASK PEOPLE THAT.

12:32.119 --> 12:37.057
- WELL, IF YOU DON'T TELL ME,
I'LL JUST ASSUME THE WORST.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.893
I WAS FORCED TO ATTEND
A SENSITIVITY TRAINING CLASS,

12:39.927 --> 12:42.429
WHERE I WAS SUBJECTED
TO A GLORIOUS GOLD MINE

12:42.462 --> 12:44.564
OR RACIALLY CHARGED
HATE LANGUAGE.

12:44.597 --> 12:45.999
- YES?

12:46.033 --> 12:49.002
- HOW WOULD YOU USE [bleep]
IN A SENTENCE?

12:49.036 --> 12:51.571
- THE POINT IS, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
USE IT IN A SENTENCE.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.506
IF YOU'RE UNCERTAIN
AS TO ANYTHING YOU'RE SAYING,

12:53.540 --> 12:55.308
WHETHER IT'S GONNA
BE OFFENSIVE OR NOT...

12:55.342 --> 12:58.946
- HEY, HOW MANY [bleep] DOES IT
TAKE TO SCREW IN A LIGHTBULB?

12:58.979 --> 13:00.447
- I DON'T KNOW.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.082
- I DON'T KNOW EITHER.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.852
THEY'RE ALL TOO BUSY [bleep]
THEIR COUSINS.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.719
- NO ONE HERE SHOULD BE MADE
TO FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE...

13:06.753 --> 13:08.388
- [chuckles]
- [whispering] THANK YOU.

13:08.421 --> 13:10.057
- EH.
- [normal voice] I'M FORREST.

13:10.090 --> 13:12.692
I TOO AM INTOLERANT OF THOSE
WHO DON'T SHARE MY RACE.

13:12.725 --> 13:15.362
MY NEW FRIEND WAS CALLED JIM,
AND HE WAS A TRUE CONNOISSEUR

13:15.395 --> 13:17.164
OF RACE-BASED HATRED,

13:17.197 --> 13:20.233
AS I LEARNED WHEN HE INVITED ME
BACK TO HIS LAIR.

13:20.267 --> 13:22.870
- EVER NOTICE THE LOWER
THAT THEY WEAR THEIR PANTS,

13:22.903 --> 13:24.504
THE LOWER
OUR PROPERTY VALUES GO.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.239
- HMM.
- YOU GOT A PRESIDENT

13:26.273 --> 13:28.608
THAT WANTS TO TAKE AWAY
OUR GUNS?

13:28.641 --> 13:30.377
YOU KNOW WHO ELSE WANTED
TO TAKE AWAY THE GUNS?

13:30.410 --> 13:32.379
- WHO'S THAT?
- HITLER!

13:32.412 --> 13:34.114
- YEAH.
WELL, YOU LIKE HITLER.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.449
- YEAH, YEAH, I-I LIKE THE WAY
HE STARTED OUT.

13:36.483 --> 13:37.617
- OKAY.
- BUT WHEN HE STARTED WITH

13:37.650 --> 13:39.352
THE OBAMA STUFF, THAT'S WHEN IT

13:39.386 --> 13:41.121
ALL WENT DOWNHILL.
- YEP.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.355
- YOU'RE LIKE ME.
- MM-HMM.

13:42.389 --> 13:43.790
- WHAT DO WE HAVE IN COMMON?

13:43.891 --> 13:45.792
WE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON, SEE?
- WE ARE WHITE.

13:45.893 --> 13:47.127
- WHY DO THEY SAY BLACK PEOPLE

13:47.160 --> 13:48.561
ARE BETTER DANCERS
THAN WHITE PEOPLE?

13:48.595 --> 13:50.763
- I'M A GREAT DANCER!

13:50.797 --> 13:53.133
AFTER MEETING JIM,
I REALIZED I HAD TO TAKE

13:53.166 --> 13:56.103
MY RACISM UP A NOTCH.
- HOW ABOUT THAT?

13:56.136 --> 13:57.905
[indistinct chatter]
- AT LAST, I WAS PREPARED

13:57.938 --> 14:00.707
TO INFECT EVERYONE AROUND ME
WITH A VIRULENT STRAIN

14:00.740 --> 14:03.610
OF THE SOCIAL DISEASE
THAT IS RACISM.

14:03.643 --> 14:09.182
WHY IS THERE A BLACK MAN
AND HIS BABY MAMA IN MY HOME?

14:09.216 --> 14:11.919
HMM?
- SOMEBODY CALL THE COPS.

14:11.919 --> 14:14.521
[laughter]

14:14.554 --> 14:16.223
- WELL, NO, I DON'T THINK
THAT WILL BE NECESSARY,

14:16.256 --> 14:17.824
BUT I AM GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU
TO LEAVE.

14:17.925 --> 14:20.460
[laughter]
- YEAH, RIGHT.

14:20.493 --> 14:21.728
- BUT BEING A CONVINCING RACIST

14:21.761 --> 14:23.796
WAS HARDER
THAN I'D EVER IMAGINED.

14:23.830 --> 14:26.566
I'M SORRY. I'M AFRAID
I'M QUITE SERIOUS, OKAY?

14:26.599 --> 14:28.969
WE CANNOT HAVE YOU HERE MIXING
WITH OUR WHITE WOMEN!

14:29.002 --> 14:31.371
[laughter]

14:31.404 --> 14:33.040
EXCUSE ME!
THERE IS NOTHING FUNNY

14:33.073 --> 14:36.243
ABOUT WHAT THE BLACK MAN
IS DOING TO OUR COUNTRY!

14:36.276 --> 14:39.246
I DON'T KNOW WHAT EVERYBODY
IS LAUGHING ABOUT,

14:39.279 --> 14:42.249
BUT I AM TIRED OF YOU BLACK
PEOPLE BRINGING DOWN

14:42.282 --> 14:45.052
OUR PROPERTY VALUES
AND OUR SCHOOLS

14:45.085 --> 14:47.587
AND NEVER SHUTTING UP
ABOUT YOUR CATERING BUSINESS!

14:47.620 --> 14:50.057
TO HAVE THE DESIRED EFFECT,
I WOULD NEED TO CROSS

14:50.090 --> 14:52.159
A BOUNDARY
WHICH MUST NEVER BE CROSSED

14:52.192 --> 14:55.162
AND SAY
WHAT MUST NEVER BE SAID.

14:55.195 --> 14:58.198
LAUGH IT UP, YOU [bleep]!

14:58.231 --> 15:02.002
[woman laughing]

15:05.138 --> 15:06.974
[woman stops laughing]

15:06.974 --> 15:10.077
I AM A RACIST NOW.
DEAL WITH IT.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.112
- [sighs]
- OKAY, SO YOU'VE BECOME

15:12.145 --> 15:15.348
AN OVERT RACIST
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

15:15.382 --> 15:17.417
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "OVERT RACIST"?

15:17.450 --> 15:20.253
- I MEAN, THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN
SOME RACISM IN YOU,

15:20.287 --> 15:21.989
BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
PROUD OF IT.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.991
- HOW HAS THERE BEEN RACISM IN--
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

15:23.991 --> 15:26.293
- OKAY, DO YOU REMEMBER
LAST YEAR,

15:26.326 --> 15:29.129
YOU ASKED EVERYONE
ON THE BLOCK BUT ME

15:29.162 --> 15:31.198
TO KEEP YOUR KEY
WHILE YOU WENT ON VACATION?

15:31.231 --> 15:32.465
- YEAH, WELL,
YOU WERE NOT HOME.

15:32.499 --> 15:34.867
- WE--WE WERE HOME.
- YOU WERE HOME?

15:34.901 --> 15:36.469
- WE WERE HOME.

15:36.503 --> 15:38.371
- AND YOU'VE ASKED ME
THREE DIFFERENT TIMES

15:38.405 --> 15:40.440
IF I WENT TO COLLEGE
ON A BASKETBALL SCHOLARSHIP.

15:40.473 --> 15:41.674
- YOU DID, DIDN'T YOU?

15:41.708 --> 15:43.510
- NO.
- OH, MY GOD.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.145
- YOU DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE
ON A BASKETBALL SCHOLARSHIP?

15:45.178 --> 15:48.181
- I'M 5'7", FORREST.
- LOOK AT HIM. NO.

15:48.215 --> 15:50.550
- AND WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA
WAS ELECTED,

15:50.583 --> 15:53.386
YOU CONGRATULATED ME.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.522
- WELL, YOU VOTED
FOR HIM, RIGHT?

15:55.555 --> 15:57.890
- [scoffs]
- I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THAT,

15:57.924 --> 16:00.227
LIKE BRUCE WILLIS
IN THE SIXTH SENSE--

16:00.260 --> 16:01.794
SPOILER ALERT--

16:01.828 --> 16:04.064
I HAD BEEN A RACIST ALL ALONG.

16:04.097 --> 16:07.367
GENE, IT SEEMS, HAD LEARNED
TO LIVE WITH THAT FACT LONG AGO,

16:07.400 --> 16:10.403
BUT HE DID GIVE ME ONE
VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF ADVICE.

16:10.437 --> 16:13.773
- NEVER, EVER--
AND I DO RECOMMEND THIS--

16:13.806 --> 16:16.376
GO AROUND
CALLING ANYBODY THAT.

16:16.409 --> 16:17.810
- OH, THAT--YEAH, I'LL GET RID
OF THAT ONE,

16:17.844 --> 16:19.612
'CAUSE THAT SEEMED
TO UPSET EVERYONE.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.248
- YEAH.

16:21.281 --> 16:23.583
- UP TILL NOW, IT'S BEEN
A BLESSING TO BE IN DENIAL

16:23.616 --> 16:25.418
ABOUT MY RACIST FEELINGS.

16:25.452 --> 16:28.721
ACKNOWLEDGING THEM HAS MADE ME
FEEL AS STUPID AND DISGUSTING

16:28.755 --> 16:30.890
AS THAT MORON
WITH THE NAZI FLAG.

16:30.923 --> 16:33.760
BEING A RACIST--
HALF A STAR.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.428
- UGH, FORREST.
- YES?

16:35.462 --> 16:37.797
- NO, IT SHOULD GET NO STARS.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.466
- WELL, WE DON'T DO ZERO STARS.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.068
- BUT IT'S RACISM.

16:41.068 --> 16:43.136
- YES, BUT HALF A STAR
IS OUR LOWEST RATING.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.604
WE HAD A LONG MEETING ABOUT IT.

16:44.637 --> 16:47.274
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST.
- WHO KNEW? [laughs]

16:49.176 --> 16:51.511
- I DIDN'T.
- YEAH, WELL, YOU MIGHT HAVE.

16:51.544 --> 16:52.812
- YEAH.

16:56.083 --> 16:59.452
[fanfare plays]

16:59.486 --> 17:02.189
- I CAN'T WAIT TO FIND OUT
WHAT'S IN STORE FOR ME NEXT.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.490
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT,
FORREST.

17:03.523 --> 17:04.557
- GOOD.

17:04.591 --> 17:06.193
- THIS ONE'S FROM @MEATSMURDERS

17:06.226 --> 17:08.895
IN RIDGEWOOD, NEW JERSEY.
SHE TWEETS...

17:15.435 --> 17:19.472
- WOW, HAVING TO HUNT AND KILL
AN ANIMAL TO EAT IT.

17:19.506 --> 17:21.574
I ADMIT--THAT MAKES ME VERY,
VERY SQUEAMISH.

17:21.608 --> 17:25.145
BUT I GUESS I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO DO WHAT ALL MEN ONCE DID

17:25.178 --> 17:27.880
OUT OF SHEER,
SAVAGE NECESSITY--

17:27.914 --> 17:31.684
ROUND UP A TELEVISION CREW
AND HEAD TO THE HUNT.

17:31.718 --> 17:32.919
I'VE CHOSEN THIS SPOT HERE

17:32.952 --> 17:35.188
IN THE ANGELES CREST
NATIONAL FOREST,

17:35.222 --> 17:38.591
A PLACE WHERE I CAN FIND
AN ANIMAL AND SLAY IT

17:38.625 --> 17:40.993
AND SKIN IT
AND THEN DEVOUR IT.

17:41.027 --> 17:42.495
AND I'M HERE UNDER COVER
OF DARKNESS

17:42.529 --> 17:43.830
BECAUSE THERE SIMPLY
WASN'T TIME

17:43.863 --> 17:45.832
TO ARRANGE
FOR THE NECESSARY PERMITS,

17:45.865 --> 17:48.435
AND SO WE'RE--
WE'RE JUST DOING IT THIS WAY.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.036
I'M ACCOMPANIED
BY MY FATHER-IN-LAW,

17:50.137 --> 17:52.004
JACK WALTHALL,
WHO BROUGHT ALONG THE RIFLE

17:52.038 --> 17:54.941
AND THE HUNTING SMARTS AND ALSO
THE RUGGED INDIVIDUALISM

17:54.974 --> 17:56.176
OF A BYGONE ERA, RIGHT?

17:56.209 --> 17:57.344
- HELLO.
- VERY GOOD.

17:57.377 --> 17:58.945
NOW, JACK, YOU HAD A VERY

17:58.978 --> 18:02.615
INTERESTING AND SORT OF
CLEVER-SOUNDING HUNTING PLOY.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.151
YOU CARE TO SHARE THAT WITH US?
- OH.

18:04.151 --> 18:06.653
WELL, IT'S NOT REALLY
MY IDEA, FORREST.

18:06.686 --> 18:10.157
IT'S S.O.P.--IT'S STANDARD
OPERATING...SOMETHING ELSE.

18:10.157 --> 18:11.158
- UH, RIGHT.

18:11.191 --> 18:12.992
- IT'S DOE'S SCENT.

18:13.025 --> 18:16.596
IT'S ESTRUS URINE OF A DOE.

18:16.629 --> 18:19.299
NOW, THIS WILL ATTRACT A BUCK,
AND THEN ALL YOU NEED TO DO

18:19.332 --> 18:21.268
IS FIRE A BULLET OFF
AT HIS VITAL ORGANS,

18:21.301 --> 18:23.970
AND YOU'RE IN BUSINESS.
- YES, GOOD. OKAY.

18:24.003 --> 18:26.173
VERY GOOD.
THAT'S PRETTY INGENIOUS.

18:26.173 --> 18:27.840
I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE,
BUT I'M ABOUT TO TAKE IT

18:27.874 --> 18:29.842
A BIG STEP FORWARD.

18:29.876 --> 18:32.545
JOSH, WILL YOU PLEASE BRING
THE DOE-COY OUT HERE, WON'T YOU?

18:32.579 --> 18:34.181
- OKAY.
- I HAPPENED TO BE IN POSSESSION

18:34.214 --> 18:37.049
OF A NONRETURNABLE
$4,000 SEX DOLL,

18:37.083 --> 18:39.952
AND I WAS EAGER TO FIND
ALTERNATE USES FOR HER.

18:39.986 --> 18:41.988
HER SPECIFIC TALENT SEEMED
PERFECT FOR TONIGHT'S MISSION.

18:42.021 --> 18:43.323
- WHAT IS THAT?

18:43.356 --> 18:45.057
IT LOOKS LIKE
A BEAUTIFUL DEAD LADY.

18:45.091 --> 18:48.961
- YES, WELL, ON ANY OTHER NIGHT,
PERHAPS, BUT TONIGHT SHE IS

18:48.995 --> 18:52.632
THE SEXIEST DOE IN ALL
OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.201
OH, THAT LOOKS GREAT!

18:54.201 --> 18:55.702
THAT'S EVEN BETTER THAN
I THOUGHT IT WOULD LOOK.

18:55.735 --> 18:56.803
- I'VE SEEN WORSE IN BARS,
I'LL TELL YOU.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.070
- [laughs]
- YOU HAVE?

18:58.104 --> 18:59.406
- THAT'S FANTASTIC.

18:59.439 --> 19:01.208
HEY, COME AND GET HER,
ALL YOU BUCKS!

19:01.241 --> 19:03.476
TRUST ME, SHE'S NO PRUDE!
[laughter]

19:03.510 --> 19:05.545
- SHE'S INTO WHATEVER
YOU'RE INTO!

19:05.578 --> 19:07.314
[laughter]
- THAT'S GREAT.

19:07.347 --> 19:08.615
HEY, JOSH, YOU BROUGHT
THE BOLT CUTTERS, RIGHT?

19:08.648 --> 19:09.716
- YEAH, YEAH.
- OKAY, GOOD.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.751
IN TRUTH, THE IDEA OF A FIREARM

19:11.784 --> 19:13.953
IN THE HANDS
OF A 75-YEAR-OLD MAN

19:13.986 --> 19:15.822
IN LOW-VISIBILITY CONDITIONS

19:15.855 --> 19:18.325
MADE ME TERRIBLY NERVOUS,
BUT I WAS DETERMINED

19:18.358 --> 19:20.927
TO CARRY ON FOR THE SAKE
OF HUMAN UNDERSTANDING.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.629
WELL, IT DOES SEEM
A LITTLE BIT CRUEL

19:22.662 --> 19:24.464
TO GET THE BUCKS' HOPES UP
LIKE THIS, YOU KNOW?

19:24.497 --> 19:26.266
THEY THINK THEY'RE GONNA GET
SOME ACTION, RIGHT?

19:26.299 --> 19:28.401
[chuckles]
BUT WHEN YOU'RE HUNTING,

19:28.435 --> 19:29.969
YOU USE EVERY TOOL
AT YOUR DISPOSAL, RIGHT?

19:30.002 --> 19:31.938
WHETHER IT'S A GUN
OR A SUPERIOR INTELLECT.

19:31.971 --> 19:34.507
NOW, MY QUESTION IS,
WHERE THE BEST PLACE--

19:34.541 --> 19:35.742
[tiger roars]
OH!

19:35.775 --> 19:37.109
[all screaming, tiger roaring]

19:37.143 --> 19:38.245
- WHAT THE HECK?
- MR. MACNEIL!

19:38.245 --> 19:39.779
[screaming, animals roaring]

19:39.812 --> 19:41.814
- WHAT'S HAPPENED?
MR. MACNEIL!

19:41.848 --> 19:43.783
- HE'S EATING ME!

19:43.816 --> 19:46.319
[screams]
[animals screeching]

19:46.353 --> 19:48.588
- MR. MACNEIL, WHERE ARE YOU?
- FORREST, WHERE ARE YOU?

19:48.621 --> 19:50.757
- THE TIGER IS ATTACKING ME!

19:50.790 --> 19:53.293
THIS IS A GOD DAMN TIGER!
- I GOT HIM! I GOT HIM!

19:53.326 --> 19:54.627
- HE'S OVER THERE!
- OH, GOD!

19:54.661 --> 19:56.128
- OH, MY [bleep] GOD!

19:56.162 --> 19:57.664
[tiger growls]
- THERE'S A [bleep] TIGER!

19:57.697 --> 19:59.532
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- NO!

19:59.566 --> 20:01.200
- WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP?

20:01.200 --> 20:01.268
- WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP?
- SHOOT THE TIGER!
- OH.

20:01.268 --> 20:02.335
- SHOOT THE TIGER!
- OH.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.103
STAND BACK.
- [screams]

20:04.136 --> 20:05.705
[gunshot]

20:05.738 --> 20:08.107
[all screaming, shouting]

20:08.140 --> 20:10.343
[gunshots]

20:10.377 --> 20:12.512
- AS IT TURNS OUT,
WE ACCIDENTALLY DROVE

20:12.545 --> 20:16.649
INTO SILVER-SCREEN STAR
TIPPI HEDREN'S BIG-CAT PRESERVE.

20:16.683 --> 20:19.452
AND THEN THE AGE-OLD RIVALRY
OF MAN VERSUS BEAST

20:19.486 --> 20:21.020
PLAYED OUT ONCE AGAIN.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.556
LIKE THE ANCIENT HUNTERS,
IN THE END,

20:23.590 --> 20:26.293
OUR MASTERY OF TOOLS SAVED ME.

20:26.326 --> 20:30.062
IN THIS CASE, THE TIGER CHOKED
ON MY MICROPHONE AND DIED.

20:30.096 --> 20:32.231
- BETTER HIM THAN YOU.
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO SAD

20:32.265 --> 20:34.801
TO KEEP DOING THE SHOW
WITHOUT YOU.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.737
- SAD, YES,
BUT ALSO IMPOSSIBLE.

20:37.770 --> 20:40.673
- RIGHT.
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.241
IMPOSSIBLE.
- YES.

20:42.275 --> 20:43.743
HUNTING IS A MIXED BAG--

20:43.776 --> 20:46.879
TERRIFYING, EXHILARATING,
AND FAIRLY CRUEL--

20:46.913 --> 20:49.916
3 1/2 STARS.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.526
- WE HAVE A TIGER-ATTACK
SITUATION!

20:59.559 --> 21:01.494
- HE'S DEAD. HE'S GONNA BE DEAD.
- THIS IS A CLASSIC CASE

21:01.528 --> 21:03.430
OF THE HUNTER BECOMING HUNTED.
- HE'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

21:03.463 --> 21:05.432
- IF I REMAIN VERY CALM,

21:05.465 --> 21:07.534
I BELIEVE I CAN GET
THROUGH THIS,

21:07.567 --> 21:10.570
AND I AM ENTIRELY AT THE MERCY
OF THIS TIGER.
