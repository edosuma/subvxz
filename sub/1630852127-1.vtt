Don't you have lives to save?

Yep.

02:01.014 --> 02:02.974

Well, we bought this house together

but she still lives there

02:05.574 --> 02:07.054
and we want to sell it.

02:14.174 --> 02:16.494
Oh, that's right. You said you put up
a 'for sale' sign?

02:16.534 --> 02:18.574
But she doesn't get
that when you sell a house,

02:18.614 --> 02:20.054
people come through for inspections

02:20.094 --> 02:22.814

you don't get a good price.

help us sell the house

13:35.094 --> 13:36.614
Max?
Suite two's free.

13:36.654 --> 13:38.534
Could you show Renee
to suite two, please.

13:38.574 --> 13:40.014
MAX: Yeah, of course. Hi.

13:40.054 --> 13:42.254
Alright, come on.

13:42.294 --> 13:43.854
Uh, just around here.

13:43.894 --> 13:47.094
Is she alright?
Yeah. Yeah.

13:47.134 --> 13:49.414
Please, don't go.

13:49.454 --> 13:50.694
Will you wait?

13:50.734 --> 13:52.614
Yep.

13:53.654 --> 13:55.254
OK.

14:00.814 --> 14:02.134
(ULTRASOUND PULSES)

14:02.174 --> 14:05.854
OK, all good. And what about Doug?
Do you want me to give him a call?

14:05.894 --> 14:07.174
RENEE: No. No.

14:09.814 --> 14:12.614
Max, would you mind seeing
if Laney needs help with anything?

14:16.974 --> 14:18.774
(EXHALES)

14:18.814 --> 14:20.334
Is everything alright with the baby?

14:20.374 --> 14:22.414
Yeah. All the signs are normal.

14:22.454 --> 14:24.974
Renee, you're in labour.
It's OK to feel stressed.

14:25.014 --> 14:26.694
I just think something's wrong.

14:26.734 --> 14:27.854
Nothing's wrong.

14:29.814 --> 14:32.054
You're in great condition.
The baby's fine.

14:33.534 --> 14:36.214
You've been calling quite often
the past couple of weeks.

14:37.214 --> 14:38.694
Is everything OK?

14:46.054 --> 14:47.494
Is it something with Doug?

14:51.974 --> 14:53.494
He's been violent?

14:57.494 --> 14:59.054
(CRIES)

14:59.094 --> 15:00.934
Well, that didn't happen in one day.

15:03.014 --> 15:05.774
Tell me what's been going on.

15:05.814 --> 15:08.014
Are you in danger?
(CRIES)

15:08.054 --> 15:09.174
Hey.

15:09.214 --> 15:13.054
It's OK. You're safe. You're safe.
(CRIES)

15:14.374 --> 15:16.294
I need you.
I've got another situation.

15:16.334 --> 15:17.614
No. Please.

15:17.654 --> 15:19.374
I do. It's serious.

15:19.414 --> 15:21.414
I need to pee.

15:23.534 --> 15:25.734
In two, we've got a woman in crisis.

15:25.774 --> 15:27.254
Define 'crisis'.

15:27.294 --> 15:29.574
Her husband's been hitting her.

15:31.094 --> 15:33.374
(TOILET FLUSHES)

15:34.454 --> 15:37.174
Who is this?
Renee. She's one of mine.

15:38.534 --> 15:41.174
Her husband is the guy
with the guitars?

15:41.214 --> 15:42.654
Doug. Yeah.

15:42.694 --> 15:44.414
He's been abusive?

15:44.454 --> 15:46.054
The dynamic with him
has always been...

15:46.094 --> 15:47.894
He was a jerk.
Yeah.

15:47.934 --> 15:49.054
She's left him.

15:49.094 --> 15:52.254
If he sets foot in here,
I'm gonna kill him.

15:52.294 --> 15:53.854
She doesn't have anywhere to go.

15:53.894 --> 15:55.454
Her family's not here.

15:55.494 --> 15:59.134
So, she's gonna need
some extra time here.

15:59.174 --> 16:01.094
Yeah.
Yeah, we'll figure this out for her.

16:01.134 --> 16:02.454
Thank you.

16:02.494 --> 16:05.214
And...?

16:05.254 --> 16:07.214
Your daughter?

16:07.254 --> 16:10.294

16:20.254 --> 16:22.854
Grace, I need you, please.
Uh, can it wait two minutes?

16:22.894 --> 16:24.374
No, it's Ying Yue.

16:24.414 --> 16:27.614
Hey.
I'll make sure she doesn't leave.

16:27.654 --> 16:28.934
Thank you.

16:37.334 --> 16:39.294
Hey.

16:39.334 --> 16:41.094
Uh, Grace won't be long.

16:41.134 --> 16:42.334
OK.

16:42.374 --> 16:45.014
Can I get you anything?

16:45.054 --> 16:48.414
Um, my battery's
actually running out of charge.

16:48.454 --> 16:50.734
Can I plug a charger in somewhere?
Sure.

16:50.774 --> 16:53.134
There's a power point
just over there.

16:54.374 --> 16:55.574
Thanks.

17:03.694 --> 17:04.694
(CHARGER BLEEPS)

17:08.294 --> 17:11.014
Uh, it's cheese and a bit of pickle.

17:11.054 --> 17:13.254
Thought maybe you might need
some food.

17:14.294 --> 17:16.614
I mean, you don't have to eat it.
I just threw it together.

17:18.174 --> 17:20.214
I quite like it
as a tasty snack sandwich

17:20.254 --> 17:23.374
but I'm not forcing you to have it.
(LAUGHS)

17:24.614 --> 17:29.854
I'll just pop it here and...
if you feel like it, then have it.

18:03.214 --> 18:04.854
I'm gonna need you to push, OK?

just like we practised, OK?

to contact your dad?

Yeah.

if you called him.

is Saturday?

Is that what you were calling about?

OK, but how did she find you?
I don't...

but it wasn't through the system.

believe me, you don't have to.

was not that you flaked out

when you went into a room
full of powerful people

24:22.134 --> 24:24.494
to let them know you've been doing
excellent work

24:24.534 --> 24:25.974
and they should give you
more funding...

No, no, no...

24:27.374 --> 24:29.214
You know what disappointed me?
What?

24:29.254 --> 24:33.254
You went into a room to ask for
money and forgot to ask for money.

24:35.774 --> 24:38.214
What's going on?
Nothing.

24:38.254 --> 24:40.614

No, I don't.

It's gonna feel better soon,
I promise, OK?

Should I push?
No, no, no. Not yet, not yet.

for giving birth?

Can I just...

25:21.294 --> 25:23.374
You want to stand up?
Yeah.

25:23.414 --> 25:25.214
Oooh...

25:26.494 --> 25:27.894
Just keep walking.

25:31.534 --> 25:33.494
Come in.
What, are you his boss?

25:33.534 --> 25:35.414

yeah?

25:41.534 --> 25:43.614
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

25:45.094 --> 25:46.894
You sure you don't want me
to call anyone?

25:46.934 --> 25:49.894
No. I'm alright.

25:49.934 --> 25:51.494
What about the baby's father?

25:51.534 --> 25:53.454
He's nothing to do with it.

25:55.494 --> 25:57.654
Well, I'm sure your dad
would want to know.

25:57.694 --> 25:58.974
No.

26:00.654 --> 26:02.934
Sophia, are you sure?
I think having someone...

26:02.974 --> 26:05.534
God, look, I've said no
more than once. Is there a problem?

26:07.134 --> 26:08.974
How about I leave you alone
for a bit?

26:11.174 --> 26:12.214
Yeah.

26:14.334 --> 26:17.454
If you get the urge to push or if
you need anything at all, just...

26:17.494 --> 26:19.054
Yeah, the button. I know.

26:28.534 --> 26:30.654
Max, why did you come in just now?

26:30.694 --> 26:33.094
Laney told me to come find you.
Why?

26:33.134 --> 26:35.774
Uh, she told me to tell you
that you're my supervisor

26:35.814 --> 26:39.254
and you should stop making me
her problem.

26:41.014 --> 26:42.734
What's going on?

26:43.854 --> 26:45.974
That's Renee's husband, Doug.
(DOOR CLOSES)

26:46.014 --> 26:47.694
Sasha!
SASHA: Yeah?

26:47.734 --> 26:49.334
Call the police.

26:51.094 --> 26:52.174
So, what's this guy done?

26:52.214 --> 26:54.174
He's dangerous.
That's all you need to know.

26:54.214 --> 26:55.934
There he is.
OK. I'll go around.

26:55.974 --> 26:58.334
Hey, Doug! Hey, it's Grace!

26:58.894 --> 27:01.574
Hey, can I just ask,
is the baby awake?

27:02.894 --> 27:04.974
Yes.
OK. Then we shouldn't shout.

27:05.014 --> 27:07.254
We don't want to distress her.

27:07.294 --> 27:08.854
All good.

27:08.894 --> 27:10.334
We're all good.

27:10.374 --> 27:11.774
It's all good.
She left me.

27:11.814 --> 27:13.774
I know.
She didn't want me to see her...

27:13.814 --> 27:16.174
Yeah, I know, Doug,
but let's think about this, OK?

27:16.214 --> 27:18.054
Now you're gonna get yourself
into trouble.

27:18.094 --> 27:19.814
Look, you don't have a carrier
for the baby.

27:19.854 --> 27:22.534
You can't just drive off
with a baby in the backseat.

27:22.574 --> 27:25.574
I think if you stop now,
we can probably figure this out.

27:25.614 --> 27:28.174
Are the police coming?
Yeah, they are.

27:29.134 --> 27:30.774
Hey, you don't want to hurt
the baby.

27:30.814 --> 27:32.814
No, I want to take my daughter home!
Hey, hey!

27:32.854 --> 27:34.614
This is a new situation
for all of us, OK?

27:34.654 --> 27:37.454
None of us wants to be a knob.
I don't want to be a knob. Max?

27:37.494 --> 27:38.694
Definitely not.
No.

27:38.734 --> 27:40.934
Doug, you don't want to be a knob,
do you?

27:40.974 --> 27:42.814
I want everything
to go back to normal again.

27:42.854 --> 27:44.494
Right. Well, I can't control that.

27:44.534 --> 27:45.894
But, Doug, I can guarantee you,

27:45.934 --> 27:47.934
if you're still holding the baby
when the cops gets here,

27:47.974 --> 27:50.294
it's gonna be a lot worse
than if you just give her to me now.

27:52.974 --> 27:56.934
She... She tried to take
the baby away from me.

27:56.974 --> 27:58.934
Mate, it sucks. It sucks.

27:58.974 --> 28:02.174
But what you're doing now, it's not
the way to get what you want.

28:02.734 --> 28:04.614
Come on, mate, you know that.

28:06.974 --> 28:08.494
No, no, no, Max,
you're gonna stay there.

28:08.534 --> 28:10.214
You're just gonna stay right there.

28:11.534 --> 28:14.414
Hey, Doug, I'd like to come forward
and take the baby.

28:15.894 --> 28:17.454
You cool if I do that?

28:18.374 --> 28:19.894
That's it. That's it.

28:21.134 --> 28:22.934
That's it.

28:24.894 --> 28:27.854
Oh, hello, miss.

28:27.894 --> 28:30.294
I'm just gonna pass her over to Max
so he can have a hold.

28:32.854 --> 28:34.494
(WHISPERS)
Just slowly walk back inside.

28:38.894 --> 28:42.574
Do you have any idea
how fragile that new baby is?

28:42.614 --> 28:44.334
You could have seriously hurt her!

28:44.374 --> 28:46.694
And you have hurt Renee.
(TYRES SCREECH)

28:48.254 --> 28:50.214
There are consequences for that,
mate.

28:50.254 --> 28:52.334
Now, I could try and shield you
from those consequences

28:52.374 --> 28:54.614
but I think that you need to
feel them.

28:59.334 --> 29:00.694
POLICE OFFICER:
How are you going, mate?

29:00.734 --> 29:04.614
And, Max, when I ask you to get
biscuits, get them yourself.

29:04.654 --> 29:07.694
Roger that.
(BABY CRIES)

29:15.614 --> 29:18.734
I've put in some calls.
Doug isn't getting back in here.

29:18.774 --> 29:20.334
Thank you.

29:22.094 --> 29:23.734
You're gonna get a visit
from a counsellor

29:23.774 --> 29:26.374
and I've arranged a place for you
to stay when you leave.

29:29.894 --> 29:31.574
And take this.

29:32.654 --> 29:34.494
Just take it.
No, I can't take that...

29:34.534 --> 29:35.894
Just take it.

29:43.974 --> 29:45.414
Renee...

29:47.374 --> 29:51.174
just for your own sake
and for the sake of the baby,

29:51.214 --> 29:52.854
don't go back to him.

30:03.934 --> 30:06.334
Well, I'm sorry,
I just don't buy a word of this...

30:06.374 --> 30:07.734
I don't know what you want from me,
Diane.

30:07.774 --> 30:09.534
She's already admitted
that something's happened.

30:09.574 --> 30:10.934
OK, well, it's not my place
to tell you.

30:10.974 --> 30:12.254
Well, has a woman been injured?
No!

30:12.294 --> 30:14.414
A baby or something?
I can tell you that it's private.

30:14.454 --> 30:15.934
Look...
Don't manhandle me.

30:15.974 --> 30:17.214
Diane!
Sorry.

30:17.254 --> 30:18.334
Leave Laney alone.

30:21.014 --> 30:23.774
Then why don't you tell me
what's going on?

30:26.094 --> 30:28.294
OK, fine. I give up.

30:29.374 --> 30:32.174
You're gonna find out
sooner or later, so here it is.

30:34.254 --> 30:36.854
The daughter I gave up for adoption
is here.

30:37.774 --> 30:39.134
She's in this room.

30:39.174 --> 30:40.374
Her name is Sophia.

30:40.414 --> 30:43.094
And she is about to give birth
to a baby of her own.

30:43.134 --> 30:45.934
And, no, I did not want you to know.

30:47.334 --> 30:50.414
Mum, you're not going in there.

30:57.694 --> 30:58.854
Alright.

31:04.214 --> 31:05.494
Alright.

31:19.734 --> 31:21.094
Thank you.

31:26.094 --> 31:27.214

You never told me
you had a daughter.

Oh, you, your mum, your ex.

Jim knew but I didn't?

I was married to him.

35:51.054 --> 35:52.494
Yeah, I get it.

Oh, I bloody hope not.
I don't want him all to myself.

for you.

What?
Don't be shocked.

all your daughter stuff

36:57.294 --> 36:59.814
and I forgot about it,

36:59.854 --> 37:05.134

but I think that's him.

and it brought me here

37:46.294 --> 37:51.294
but...today
my daughter came to find me...

37:53.454 --> 37:55.294
and she gave birth.

It's been a major day of significance

38:19.214 --> 38:23.894
that I did not expect to have
and I was not prepared for.

38:26.614 --> 38:28.574
Yeah, so, anyway, that was my day.

38:29.814 --> 38:31.214

that come here after work,

40:36.894 --> 40:37.894
Oh, god...

40:40.414 --> 40:44.494
Oh, um, they said I could go
when I woke up.

40:44.534 --> 40:46.014
Right.

40:48.054 --> 40:49.734
Will you go home to your dad?

40:49.774 --> 40:52.534
No. Not right now.

40:52.574 --> 40:55.134
Um... It's too late to go back
to Goulburn now.

40:55.174 --> 40:56.854
Well, where will you go?

40:56.894 --> 40:58.334
Friend of a friend.

40:58.374 --> 41:01.094
She's got a share place
in this suburb called Bexley,

41:01.134 --> 41:04.894
so I'll just, you know, call a taxi.

41:04.934 --> 41:08.134
Oh, Sophia, if you want to stay here,
I can arrange for something...

41:08.174 --> 41:11.014
No, no, no, no, no.
No, it's... It's so fine.

41:11.054 --> 41:12.134
It's all good.

41:12.174 --> 41:14.014
It's gonna be great.

41:14.054 --> 41:16.054
Thank you, though.

41:16.094 --> 41:18.014
I'm all good.

41:20.214 --> 41:21.494
All good.

42:29.534 --> 42:30.934
(RINGING TONE)

42:33.734 --> 42:35.374
MAN: (ON PHONE) Hello?

42:35.414 --> 42:37.974
Sophia, is that you?
(HANGS UP)

43:09.614 --> 43:11.254
(EXHALES)

43:16.774 --> 43:17.814
(CLOSES DOOR)

43:22.214 --> 43:26.494
So, your room has a bed, obviously.
There's a bath.

43:27.734 --> 43:30.414
This is just temporary, you know.
Space to...

43:30.454 --> 43:32.774
Yeah. (CLOSES DOOR)

43:32.814 --> 43:34.334
This isn't me trying
to be your mother.

43:34.374 --> 43:36.374
No. I wouldn't advise that.

43:39.974 --> 43:41.254
And, I mean, with the baby, I...

43:41.294 --> 43:44.014
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.
She's my responsibility, not yours.

43:44.054 --> 43:45.534
(BABY CRIES)

43:47.734 --> 43:50.014
I think this fits.

43:50.054 --> 43:51.334
Yeah.

43:51.374 --> 43:54.054
And, um, I've got some
special bedding for this as well.

43:54.094 --> 43:58.014
Um... Uh, the sheets on your bed
are clean, I promise.

43:59.374 --> 44:00.774
I know it doesn't look like it

44:00.814 --> 44:03.654
but, um, I am actually getting
this place ready to sell.

44:03.694 --> 44:05.894
Why are you selling?

44:05.934 --> 44:08.974
Oh, you know... Marriage broke up.

44:09.774 --> 44:11.254
End of an era kind of thing.

44:20.014 --> 44:22.094
Here.

44:22.134 --> 44:23.934
Do you mind, just for a second?
Yeah.

44:23.974 --> 44:25.614
Thanks.

44:32.174 --> 44:33.694
(GURGLES)

44:36.014 --> 44:37.694
Oh...
(CRIES)

44:50.454 --> 44:51.774
Ready?
Yep.

44:54.654 --> 44:56.174
Hey.

44:56.214 --> 44:57.924
Hey. Shh.
(GURGLES)

44:57.929 --> 44:59.174
Shh.

45:01.814 --> 45:03.134
Come on.

45:03.174 --> 45:04.734
Thanks.

45:04.774 --> 45:07.334
Shh. Come on.
(GURGLES)

45:08.574 --> 45:09.574
Come on.

45:31.294 --> 45:33.694
(EXHALES)

45:52.854 --> 45:54.974
Grace's entire world...

45:55.094 --> 45:56.894
My daughter, she's here!

45:57.254 --> 45:58.814
..is in turmoil.

45:59.214 --> 46:02.254
So, you're a grandmother?
(LAUGHS)

46:02.574 --> 46:03.574
Now...

46:04.814 --> 46:09.854
..all the lives... I'm her father!
..and loves of St. Bridgid's...

46:10.174 --> 46:12.054
Thea's Dad wants to meet you.

46:12.654 --> 46:13.694
I'm Grace.

46:14.134 --> 46:16.934
..will spiral out of control...

46:17.694 --> 46:19.214
I'm not keeping the baby.

46:19.294 --> 46:21.014
..as they all face...

46:24.854 --> 46:26.614
This baby's going to
another family.
