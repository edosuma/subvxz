WEBVTT

00:10.400 --> 00:14.880
Whoever said this shit
was comfortable was a fucking misogynist.

00:15.560 --> 00:17.040
Light up your leggings!

00:21.520 --> 00:24.720
Since this bitch is so obsessed
with her hair,

00:25.160 --> 00:28.000
what do you say we shave it the fuck off?

00:33.200 --> 00:34.600
Whoa! Whoa!

00:36.440 --> 00:38.320
What the hell is going on?

00:39.520 --> 00:40.720
Justice.

00:41.440 --> 00:43.520
We've convicted Saskia of Sandy's murder,

00:43.520 --> 00:46.480
and now it's time she paid the price.
Shave it off.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.200
Sorry,
did you just say "convict"?

00:48.200 --> 00:51.240
How can you convict someone
if you haven't had a trial?

00:51.240 --> 00:53.480
Oh, stop being a narc, Amelia.

00:53.480 --> 00:55.640
- And that's coming from me.

00:55.640 --> 00:58.600
No, really, I want to know
how does this justice system work?

00:58.600 --> 01:01.240
Is it a head shave and some probation,

01:01.240 --> 01:05.560
and then you're just gonna glue the hair
back on if she wins an appeal?

01:05.560 --> 01:07.000
She needs to be punished.

01:07.120 --> 01:09.280
And if that means we need
to have a frickin' trial,

01:09.280 --> 01:11.920
then fine, we'll have a frickin' trial.

01:12.040 --> 01:14.280
Yeah.
<i>Law Order,</i> Ridge Heights style!

01:50.360 --> 01:52.680
Oyez, oyez!

01:56.360 --> 01:58.120
Saskia Vanderbeek...

01:58.720 --> 01:59.800
is a murderer.

02:01.160 --> 02:05.520
The evidence presented at this trial
will show unequivocally

02:05.520 --> 02:07.000
that she killed

02:07.000 --> 02:11.040
poor, humble exchange student
Cassandra Cooper-Reid.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.600
- God, I miss true crime so much.
- Oh, my God, me, too.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.120
All I need is some Pad See Ew,

02:17.120 --> 02:18.600
a bottle of my brightest shellac polish

02:18.720 --> 02:20.680
and this is like
my Wednesday night ritual.

02:20.680 --> 02:21.880
Exhibit A.

02:23.720 --> 02:28.000
A farewell letter supposedly
written by our American friend,

02:28.000 --> 02:30.960
and yet it is riddled
with Australian spelling.

02:32.960 --> 02:34.440
Exhibit B.

02:34.440 --> 02:38.000
The D'Amiré bag,
Sandy's most prized possession

02:38.000 --> 02:41.600
and something we, her peers, know
that she would never leave without.

02:41.600 --> 02:44.080
-  And Exhibit C.

02:44.400 --> 02:48.560
An eyewitness that saw Saskia
at the scene of the crime

02:48.560 --> 02:51.440
the very night that Sandy went missing.

02:51.440 --> 02:53.160
Let's make her reuse one tampon

02:53.160 --> 02:55.480
- until she gets toxic shock syndrome!

02:55.480 --> 02:57.560
Okay, this is hardly a fair trial.

02:57.560 --> 02:59.160
Let's give her backhanded compliments

02:59.160 --> 03:01.280
- until she suffers from poor self-esteem!

03:01.280 --> 03:03.280
I mean, it's not like
it's an impartial jury.

03:03.280 --> 03:06.040
This is like
the fucking Salem Witch Trials.

03:06.040 --> 03:07.240
Hey, great idea.

03:07.240 --> 03:08.840
Burn her at the stake!

03:16.560 --> 03:18.240
- Stop!

03:18.240 --> 03:20.240
Come on, Genevieve.
This is an absolute joke.

03:20.240 --> 03:23.480
You don't even have one of the most
crucial components of the judicial system.

03:23.480 --> 03:24.720
What are you talking about?

03:24.720 --> 03:26.480
We've already assigned the court artist.

03:28.560 --> 03:30.600
No, I'm talking about the defence lawyer.

03:30.600 --> 03:33.520
Oh, as if anyone's going to defend
a monster like Saskia.

03:33.520 --> 03:34.920
Any takers, ladies?

03:35.400 --> 03:37.000
G-U-I-L-T-Y!

03:37.000 --> 03:38.640
She ain't got no alibi.

03:38.640 --> 03:41.120
She guilty. Hey, hey, she guilty.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.920
I'll do it. I'll defend her.

03:42.920 --> 03:44.640
What, sorry? Beg your pardon?

03:44.640 --> 03:48.360
Now is not the time to realise
your unfulfilled legal career, Amelia.

03:48.360 --> 03:49.680
Yeah. You sure you want to do that?

03:50.960 --> 03:55.640
Yes. Yes, everyone deserves a fair trial,
even Saskia.

03:56.640 --> 04:00.320
Right. Let's decide on the legal system.
Are we doing civil or common?

04:00.320 --> 04:01.400
Is mediation on the table--

04:01.400 --> 04:04.080
No, we're doing TV law, okay?

04:04.600 --> 04:05.520
We say what we think,

04:05.520 --> 04:07.280
and then at the end,
everyone gets to vote on

04:07.280 --> 04:09.200
whether they reckon Saskia
is guilty or not.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.400
Yeah, and then we're going
to drown her in the pool.

04:14.120 --> 04:17.520
Okay, well, before that, I need a recess
to confer with my client...

04:18.120 --> 04:20.880
- and a judge to grant one.
- Fine.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.920
Forgettable Laura, you're it.

04:27.440 --> 04:29.440
What? Why me?

04:29.440 --> 04:32.200
Because everyone shits on you equally,
so you'll be impartial.

04:34.560 --> 04:37.000
Court adjourned

04:37.320 --> 04:39.080
until, uh...

04:40.320 --> 04:41.160
later?

04:51.520 --> 04:52.760
Um...

05:17.080 --> 05:18.360
Oi!

05:18.480 --> 05:20.240
Sas! What's our plan?

05:21.200 --> 05:23.680
Do you know what went through my head
last night after they ambushed me?

05:23.680 --> 05:26.320
I don't know. Probably something about
pretending not to talk to a mop?

05:26.320 --> 05:29.040
Relief. I don't have to be
this person any more.

05:29.040 --> 05:31.760
That's all well and good for you
and your Natalie Portman cheekbones,

05:31.760 --> 05:33.400
but we both know that
if they shave my head,

05:33.400 --> 05:35.360
I'm going to look like Sir Ben Kingsley.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.600
So, come on, please. What's our story?

05:37.600 --> 05:39.320
The truth is freeing, Zoe.

05:39.320 --> 05:40.680
Just let it play out.

05:40.680 --> 05:42.520
Sas, they have a witness.

05:42.520 --> 05:44.800
If they saw you, then they saw me, too.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.040
Oh, shit!

05:48.480 --> 05:50.520
<i>You said Phoebe's been
blackmailing you, right?</i>

05:50.520 --> 05:52.360
There's got to be something
about that in here.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.040
Why are you doing this?

06:01.000 --> 06:02.280
I did ask for a bitch.

06:03.760 --> 06:05.200
And I got one.

06:05.760 --> 06:08.360
It's only now that I can see
what toll that took on you.

06:08.840 --> 06:09.880
It did take a toll.

06:10.920 --> 06:13.560
Really freaked me out
how easily it came back, too.

06:15.360 --> 06:17.720
- And when Sandy...
- La, la, la, la, la.

06:17.720 --> 06:20.560
I don't want to hear anything
I can't unhear, okay?

06:20.560 --> 06:23.160
You know what?
In fact, let's just go with the old

06:23.760 --> 06:26.120
"you keep your lips sealed" strategy.

06:26.120 --> 06:28.640
Just let me do the talking.

06:29.400 --> 06:32.640
<i>Chicago</i> style. Time to Razzle Dazzle them.

06:41.280 --> 06:43.320
Oh, alas, the brew hath not breweth.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.400
But you can't expect me

06:44.400 --> 06:47.360
to sit through <i>Legally Blonde</i> IRL
without a drink.

06:48.600 --> 06:49.880
Oh, hell, no.

06:49.880 --> 06:53.120
- What? What? Oh, my God.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

06:53.120 --> 06:54.320
It's her again.

06:54.320 --> 06:57.600
No, it was just a really big crow
flying past. Yeah.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.360
It's a third sighting this week.

06:59.880 --> 07:02.000
Sister Bicky is haunting us.

07:02.360 --> 07:04.120
Megan, what are we going to do?

07:04.120 --> 07:05.640
Okay.

07:05.640 --> 07:08.400
Well, the only thing we can do.

07:09.520 --> 07:11.080
- Exorcism.
- Sleep with the lights on.

07:12.280 --> 07:14.040
- What?
- We're gonna need some holy water.

07:14.760 --> 07:17.280
Dear bitches,
don't be mad I've left. I...

07:17.600 --> 07:19.520
realised... Oh!

07:20.720 --> 07:24.120
Not Queen's English, dum-dum.
Realised with a "Z".

07:24.800 --> 07:25.920
- Do you have--

07:25.920 --> 07:28.280
Tampering with evidence,
are we, huh? Tight.

07:28.280 --> 07:29.560
What?

07:29.560 --> 07:31.960
No! That's... How dare you?

07:31.960 --> 07:35.480
Zoe, I saw you that night,

07:35.480 --> 07:37.600
running after Saskia like a little lapdog.

07:38.280 --> 07:41.800
But, you know, when Genevieve asks
for my eyewitness statement,

07:42.840 --> 07:43.960
I could say...

07:44.520 --> 07:46.040
that I only saw Saskia.

07:46.040 --> 07:49.400
Have you ever had a normal
human interaction in your life, Phoebe?

07:49.400 --> 07:51.920
One where you weren't bending
the other person over the whole time?

07:51.920 --> 07:53.880
Does not compute.

07:53.880 --> 07:57.000
No, I have not.
Electric Blue by lunchtime.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.200
You know, if I can save Saskia
with this letter,

07:59.200 --> 08:00.640
maybe I can save myself too.

08:00.640 --> 08:04.520
You sound very confident, Ally McBeal,
but do we have a deal?

08:04.520 --> 08:05.960
Like I have a choice.

08:05.960 --> 08:08.600
Honestly, I'm just surprised
that you didn't fuck me over sooner,

08:08.600 --> 08:11.400
- so thank you for that, I guess.
- You're so welcome,

08:11.760 --> 08:13.000
my sweet Zoe.

08:13.360 --> 08:16.440
I've been so busy bending over
much bigger fish.

08:21.840 --> 08:22.760
Wait.

08:23.120 --> 08:24.760
What does "Electric Blue" mean?

08:25.760 --> 08:28.640
And tell me, Megan,
is this the letter you found

08:28.640 --> 08:31.160
while looking for mushrooms with Tegan?

08:31.160 --> 08:34.520
Oh, yes, but can we speed this up?
Some of us have things to do.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.920
Like everyone else who bailed
on this shit.

08:37.760 --> 08:40.000
Would you read the letter out,
please, Megan?

08:41.160 --> 08:43.160
"Dear bitches.
Please don't be mad I've left.

08:43.160 --> 08:45.080
-"I realised-- "
- Let me cut you off there.

08:45.880 --> 08:48.080
Please spell out that last word.

08:48.080 --> 08:51.080
- I. It's spelled with a fucking "I".
- No, "realised."

08:51.640 --> 08:56.200
Fine. R-E-A-L-I-Z-E-D--

08:56.200 --> 08:58.720
Hah! Australian spelling.

08:58.720 --> 09:00.640
Wait, what? I don't...

09:03.080 --> 09:05.880
I swear this had an "S" not a "Z" in it.

09:06.520 --> 09:08.640
Well, obviously, it's been tampered with.

09:10.120 --> 09:13.200
Oi! You're supposed to wait
for me to dismiss you!

09:13.200 --> 09:16.440
It's okay. I have
no further questions for the witness.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.480
Correct me if I'm wrong, Genevieve,

09:19.480 --> 09:22.400
but you claim that the note
has been tampered with?

09:22.960 --> 09:23.840
Absolutely.

09:23.840 --> 09:27.840
Right, so, I mean, shouldn't it
then be thrown out as evidence?

09:27.840 --> 09:31.400
It still proves foul play
because the bag's here and Sandy's not.

09:32.480 --> 09:35.760
Right. Right, right, right, right.

09:37.240 --> 09:40.360
So the contents of the letter
remain relevant,

09:40.360 --> 09:42.440
- spelling aside?
- Yes.

09:42.440 --> 09:45.000
Yes, so Sandy did write it
and it hasn't been tampered with?

09:45.360 --> 09:46.720
No, I mean, it's forged.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.880
Okay, so it's not not
been tampered with?

09:50.000 --> 09:51.760
- Is that what you're saying?
-  What?

09:51.880 --> 09:55.160
No, yes, it's not... It's, yes, been...
Stop mixing my words.

09:55.160 --> 09:59.240
What, indeed, Genevieve?
Beyond reasonable doubt?

09:59.880 --> 10:03.440
The prosecution can't even tell you
whether this letter is evidence or not.

10:03.440 --> 10:06.040
- Throw it out, Judge Forgettable Laura.
-  Objection!

10:06.040 --> 10:08.160
She's trying to Razzle Dazzle me.

10:08.160 --> 10:11.400
And her blazer is too flashy.
It's actually quite distracting.

10:11.400 --> 10:12.520
Overruled.

10:12.520 --> 10:14.480
I don't know what just happened, but...

10:15.000 --> 10:15.880
she beat you.

10:17.520 --> 10:18.440
Fine.

10:18.960 --> 10:20.520
Then I call my eyewitness.

10:24.960 --> 10:25.960
Doesn't fit.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.960
Objection. Relevance?

10:27.960 --> 10:30.600
None. I've just always wanted to do that.

10:31.280 --> 10:34.360
Phoebe, can you please tell
the ladies of the court

10:34.360 --> 10:37.440
what you saw the night
that Sandy went missing?

10:38.600 --> 10:41.320
I was on the outskirts of the campus,

10:41.320 --> 10:44.480
looking for reception
under the soft glimmer of the moonlight.

10:46.000 --> 10:46.960
What's that?

10:47.400 --> 10:50.000
Sandy's cries echoing on the wind.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.280
Objection.

10:51.280 --> 10:53.080
- Yeah, stop milking it.
- Fine.

10:53.840 --> 10:56.280
- I saw Saskia and...

10:58.640 --> 11:02.160
And she was walking away
from the water's edge where the boat was.

11:02.520 --> 11:03.360
Alone.

11:05.320 --> 11:07.920
And that was the last time
anyone saw Sandy.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.400
- That's not what happened.
- Shh. Stop talking.

11:11.400 --> 11:13.600
No further questions, Your Honour.

11:21.840 --> 11:26.000
Tell me, Phoebe,
did you see Saskia murder Sandy?

11:26.000 --> 11:28.720
Well, she was walking
from the water's edge--

11:28.720 --> 11:33.240
So what you really saw was a woman
walking through the school grounds.

11:33.240 --> 11:34.600
You say potato,

11:35.280 --> 11:36.520
I say murderer.

11:40.680 --> 11:41.960
Phoebe...

11:44.040 --> 11:48.120
You found Sandy's D'Amiré bag
weeks ago, didn't you?

11:52.400 --> 11:53.400
What?

11:57.320 --> 11:59.800
- I don't recall.
- But you do remember the,

11:59.800 --> 12:01.960
what was it, the glimmer of moonlight?

12:02.560 --> 12:03.880
It's very convenient.

12:04.760 --> 12:07.040
I assert that you found
that bag weeks ago.

12:08.360 --> 12:12.880
In which case, why didn't you say anything
when we were all looking for Sandy?

12:12.880 --> 12:15.000
Because she was fucking annoying,
and it was peaceful without her.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.880
Or did you find the bag
and use it to your advantage?

12:17.880 --> 12:20.480
- I don't follow.
- What did you do with the bag, Phoebe?

12:20.480 --> 12:23.600
- I remind you that you are under oath.
- We actually didn't do the oath bit.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.000
I took it to Saskia.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.680
Oh, come on.
As if you're shocked.

12:28.680 --> 12:29.800
I found the bag,

12:29.800 --> 12:32.040
I took it to Saskia, and we made a deal.

12:32.040 --> 12:34.920
And if any of you had watched <i>The Wire,</i>
then you'd know it was fucking worth it.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.240
So you admit it. You extorted Saskia.

12:37.240 --> 12:38.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I did.

12:38.320 --> 12:40.760
I blackmailed her,
and I'd fucking blackmail her again, too.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.520
Well, that's proof.

12:42.520 --> 12:46.000
The fact that Saskia is blackmailable
at all says she's guilty.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.800
No, the only thing that you have
proven here today, Genevieve,

12:48.800 --> 12:51.440
is that your star witness
is a goddamn crook.

12:51.440 --> 12:55.720
In fact, once we're done with Saskia,
we should be prosecuting Phoebe next.

12:55.720 --> 12:56.680
What?

12:56.680 --> 12:58.760
We should be charging her
with extortion,

12:58.760 --> 13:01.400
embezzling Mooncups, battery gauging.

13:01.400 --> 13:05.680
This isn't about Phoebe!
It's about what a fucking bitch Saskia is!

13:16.680 --> 13:18.200
And there you have it, ladies.

13:20.040 --> 13:22.120
The real reason that we are all here.

13:23.360 --> 13:24.680
Your Honour...

13:25.480 --> 13:28.320
I implore you to dismiss this case
on the basis

13:28.320 --> 13:32.960
that it is nothing more than Genevieve's
personal vendetta against Saskia

13:34.240 --> 13:35.960
for a bit of high school bullying.

13:39.800 --> 13:40.720
You're right.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.400
It's fucking personal.

13:45.480 --> 13:46.720
<i>One time.</i>

13:47.840 --> 13:51.680
One fucking time,
she heard me do a shit at school.

13:52.640 --> 13:54.840
And do you think she ever
let me live that down?

13:54.840 --> 13:55.920
No.

13:56.360 --> 13:59.560
No, instead, she followed me
into the bathrooms

13:59.560 --> 14:02.000
any chance she could,
and she would just wait...

14:03.240 --> 14:04.800
...like a fucking psycho.

14:06.160 --> 14:09.360
Saskia would just wait there
listening for a plop,

14:10.080 --> 14:12.040
until plop I could no more.

14:12.040 --> 14:14.720
- It's not funny.

14:17.280 --> 14:21.280
Do you know what fecal impaction does
to a teenage girl's bowels?

14:23.040 --> 14:26.280
I needed heat packs, pelvic floor physio,

14:26.640 --> 14:29.200
my mum had to pay for psychologists

14:29.200 --> 14:32.440
to help me with the constant
rumination of planning

14:32.440 --> 14:35.360
when, where, how I'd shit in public.

14:37.600 --> 14:40.920
I have suffered because Saskia Vanderbeek

14:40.920 --> 14:44.200
thought it would be funny
to make me a prisoner of my own body.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.680
So you can all laugh
and call me Pepé Le Poo,

14:50.680 --> 14:53.680
but I still live with this... every day.

14:56.640 --> 14:57.800
She was abusive.

14:59.360 --> 15:01.400
There's no other word for it.

15:09.120 --> 15:11.640
I'm sorry that happened to you, Genevieve.

15:13.040 --> 15:15.720
But Saskia is not on trial
for being a bad person.

15:17.040 --> 15:18.560
Her character is not relevant.

15:18.560 --> 15:22.160
Oh, really? Isn't a murderer
just a really bad bully?

15:28.600 --> 15:33.320
You told everyone that my mum had
to sell her hair to pay for my tuition.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.960
She was going through chemo, Saskia.

15:37.960 --> 15:39.640
Yeah, I'm really sorry, Phoebe.

15:40.280 --> 15:43.520
You made me skip meals with you
until I became anaemic.

15:43.520 --> 15:46.040
- I know. I know I did.
- Saskia, let's not admit to--

15:46.040 --> 15:48.080
Guys, this was kind of my moment.

15:48.080 --> 15:50.320
You pretended like
I didn't exist for five years.

15:50.320 --> 15:53.640
You started a rumour that I was born
with an extra Y chromosome.

15:53.640 --> 15:56.400
And that my favourite Destiny's Child
was Michelle.

15:56.400 --> 15:59.520
- Oh, that one's fucked.
- You said I was too fat for dressage,

15:59.520 --> 16:00.800
that the horse should ride me.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.280
Yeah, I know.
And there's no excuse for any of it.

16:02.280 --> 16:03.680
Saskia, please, just let me handle this.

16:03.680 --> 16:06.680
You screamed at me
when I wore Ugg boots with short skirts

16:06.680 --> 16:08.840
because you said that that was your look.

16:09.600 --> 16:11.520
It was everyone's look, Sas.

16:11.520 --> 16:13.280
Okay, Forgettable Laura,
bang your little hammer.

16:13.280 --> 16:16.600
I racked up a $200 bill
on my dad's work phone

16:16.600 --> 16:18.720
texting the <i>Australian Idol</i> number
because you said

16:18.720 --> 16:22.040
that you would kill yourself
if Paulini was voted out.

16:22.040 --> 16:25.480
-  Teresa, please,
- Oh, how can I possibly forget?

16:26.360 --> 16:28.640
You told them to cut off my fucking toe!

16:28.640 --> 16:30.280
Order! Order!

16:30.560 --> 16:31.560
Let's take lunch.

16:32.520 --> 16:34.840
We can reconvene after, but first...

16:35.760 --> 16:39.360
You never did your part
of the group assignments and that...

16:40.120 --> 16:43.760
meant my work was always marked down.

16:44.440 --> 16:46.640
I had to repeat year nine...

16:50.880 --> 16:51.800
...again.

16:56.840 --> 16:58.080
You took Zoe from me.

16:59.640 --> 17:01.200
I'm not sure I ever got over that.

17:04.520 --> 17:06.200
Just, please,

17:07.280 --> 17:08.720
stay silent.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.440
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit,

17:20.440 --> 17:22.480
I command you to...

17:23.080 --> 17:23.960
Scull!

17:25.320 --> 17:28.160
Scull, scull! Scull! Scull! Scull! Scull!

17:31.400 --> 17:32.880
What you got? What you got?

17:33.880 --> 17:35.320
A pulpy vintage...

17:37.320 --> 17:39.200
- with a subtle hint of guilt.
- Really?

17:39.200 --> 17:42.640
Because I was getting
sweaty Jesus

17:42.640 --> 17:46.320
with strong daddy issues aromas,
do you know what I'm saying?

17:46.320 --> 17:48.800
Let me taste again.
Let me taste again.

17:50.400 --> 17:51.800
In the name of the Mother,

17:52.320 --> 17:55.800
the Daughter, and the Mercury rising--
Oh, fuck!

17:55.800 --> 17:57.160
It's her again.

17:57.800 --> 18:00.200
Megan, we got too distracted
by the church wine.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.320
We forgot to look for the Holy Water.

18:09.760 --> 18:12.680
I've seen you chug beer out of a shoe
too many times to count.

18:12.680 --> 18:14.160
Park your judgement.

18:20.160 --> 18:22.880
- For your Wednesday-night ritual.
- What?

18:26.640 --> 18:29.560
- You are fucking smashing it, mate.
- Thank you.

18:30.240 --> 18:32.160
- I'm pretty good at this.
- Yeah, you are.

18:32.160 --> 18:33.560
Go get her, Amelia Finch.

18:34.520 --> 18:35.520
Like Atticus Finch?

18:36.320 --> 18:37.280
I got it.

18:40.560 --> 18:44.440
I call my next witness... Zoe Miller.

18:45.240 --> 18:46.320
Wait, what?

18:47.240 --> 18:49.080
How well do you know the defendant?

18:51.800 --> 18:52.960
Um, yeah, pretty well.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.560
Not like super well, though.

18:57.480 --> 18:59.480
How well does anyone really know anyone?

19:01.280 --> 19:02.560
Excuse me.

19:03.080 --> 19:04.560
Butch Melanie, don't draw my burps.

19:05.720 --> 19:10.040
Would you consider yourself
part of Saskia's click, the Too Cools?

19:13.520 --> 19:14.560
- What?

19:16.240 --> 19:17.800
Shit, Zoe.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.520
I thought you were just being dramatic.

19:19.520 --> 19:20.760
Mm-mm.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.880
Thought I'd throw you up here
and you'd be fine.

19:22.880 --> 19:24.480
No. Got the nerps.

19:26.960 --> 19:29.040
Nervous burps. Listen, Amelia.

19:29.800 --> 19:34.400
I know we're, like, just making up.
Such a gross term.

19:35.000 --> 19:39.080
I really want to help you. It's just that
a lot of shit coming up for me right now.

19:39.200 --> 19:42.800
You know?
Like, literally shit's coming up.

19:42.800 --> 19:44.960
Speak up. We can't hear you.

19:45.560 --> 19:48.080
I said a lot of shit
is coming up for me right now.

19:51.920 --> 19:55.280
The last time I was on the stand,
the judge made me

19:55.880 --> 19:58.800
choose which parent I wanted to live with,
so I just need a minute.

20:03.400 --> 20:04.320
Oh.

20:09.080 --> 20:12.960
Objection. This is gross and has nothing
to do with Saskia murdering Sandy.

20:12.960 --> 20:15.400
Yeah, let's just throw her
off the bell tower.

20:18.520 --> 20:19.640
Chop her up!

20:21.280 --> 20:22.080
Hey.

20:22.720 --> 20:23.720
Guys.

20:23.720 --> 20:25.320
...the bell tower and it's done.

20:25.440 --> 20:27.440
- Hey!

20:29.320 --> 20:31.520
Yeah, okay.

20:31.800 --> 20:34.200
- Saskia can be a bitch.

20:34.200 --> 20:37.400
But don't pretend like you
haven't all benefited from that.

20:37.400 --> 20:40.960
Okay? Because this is a two-way street.
She led and we followed.

20:40.960 --> 20:42.400
I am living-proof.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.520
We put women like Saskia up on pedestals,

20:44.520 --> 20:47.000
and then the minute they stumble,
we fucking relish it.

20:48.160 --> 20:50.720
But we don't expect the same kind
of exceptionalism for men.

20:51.560 --> 20:52.760
Do we?

20:53.560 --> 20:56.520
We don't prosecute them
for every tiny little fuck-up.

20:56.520 --> 20:59.720
No, they get promoted. They get podcasts.

21:00.920 --> 21:03.560
They get their pick of 12 fucking hotties
on national television,

21:03.560 --> 21:05.800
even though they've got
the personality of a carrot.

21:08.080 --> 21:11.480
High school fucks all of us up,
and Saskia is no different.

21:12.520 --> 21:14.880
Yeah, okay, Genevieve, she bullied you.

21:15.320 --> 21:17.920
That sucks. She was a cunt.

21:19.280 --> 21:22.320
But we wouldn't even be here having
this stupid trial in the first place

21:22.320 --> 21:25.440
if Saskia hadn't kept us alive
long enough to do it.

21:26.040 --> 21:28.000
And nobody else here can say that.

21:37.080 --> 21:39.440
Do we slow clap?

21:40.520 --> 21:41.640
Not the time.

21:42.720 --> 21:45.320
I would like to say something.
It's time the truth came out.

21:45.320 --> 21:48.520
- No.
- Recess. I request an immediate recess.

21:48.520 --> 21:50.320
Well, just take one then.

21:51.120 --> 21:52.200
Let's go.

21:53.080 --> 21:55.640
She's feeling guilty.
And she's feeling the heat.

22:04.080 --> 22:05.280
Fuck.

22:05.920 --> 22:08.920
And the Lord said to thee

22:09.560 --> 22:14.880
that the potato will be the most divine
of all the vegetables,

22:14.880 --> 22:18.640
for it shall make chips and hash browns.

22:18.640 --> 22:20.640
Dude, stop preaching about potatoes

22:20.640 --> 22:23.000
and come up with an incantation
to help us find this shit.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.320
You know, like,
"Mother Mary, Full of Grace,

22:26.320 --> 22:28.080
help us find a parking space."

22:28.080 --> 22:31.120
Hey! Okay. I got you.

22:31.680 --> 22:33.520
I got you. Okay, um...

22:34.440 --> 22:36.000
- Give me a beat.
- All right.

22:38.680 --> 22:42.720
<i>♪ Blessed Virgin with the sexy saunter
Help us find ♪</i>

22:42.720 --> 22:44.800
<i>♪ The Holy Water ♪</i>

22:45.400 --> 22:46.880
Slay.

22:54.920 --> 22:57.480
Hey, what the hell?
I was going to do a slut drop.

22:58.360 --> 23:00.680
I didn't know
there was a toilet here?

23:16.680 --> 23:18.560
What, do you think because
a priest pissed in there,

23:18.560 --> 23:20.480
the toilet water's holy or some shit?

23:20.480 --> 23:21.720
Do you hear yourself?

23:23.160 --> 23:25.120
Toilet, uh, water.

23:36.160 --> 23:38.680
- And Genevieve knew about it.
- What the fuck?

23:39.880 --> 23:41.600
Pepé has a secret shitter.

23:43.600 --> 23:44.520
I object.

23:51.840 --> 23:53.560
Time to bail, Zo-Zo.

24:03.240 --> 24:04.680
It's set sail, baby.

24:09.160 --> 24:11.920
Oh! No, no, no. What the fuck?

24:11.920 --> 24:13.040
What the fuck?

24:14.800 --> 24:17.280
Fuck you, Super Glue. You don't do shit.

24:26.720 --> 24:27.800
All right.

24:30.600 --> 24:32.560
Time to face the clippers, Zo-Zo.

24:34.200 --> 24:35.360
Zoe is right.

24:36.840 --> 24:38.600
High school really fucks you up.

24:40.280 --> 24:43.480
This place really sucked me back in.

24:48.440 --> 24:49.640
I didn't kill Sandy.

24:54.040 --> 24:56.640
But I did push her out to sea,
and that's pretty much

24:56.640 --> 24:59.520
as good as killing her, isn't it?
For that, I should be punished.

25:01.360 --> 25:04.360
But, for as powerful as you think I am...

25:06.120 --> 25:08.320
there is always someone above you.

25:12.080 --> 25:15.840
And I know what it's like
to have that power taken from you.

25:25.600 --> 25:27.320
For the last year of school,

25:28.480 --> 25:32.280
I was in a secret relationship
with Mr. Garrity.

25:33.640 --> 25:36.480
Although I've actually learned
I wasn't the only one.

25:39.440 --> 25:41.760
There are words, really extreme words,

25:41.760 --> 25:45.240
that therapists have used
to describe what happened to me,

25:45.240 --> 25:47.960
and I never related to them
until coming back here.

25:55.640 --> 25:58.360
Sometimes I think it would be easier

25:59.120 --> 26:02.560
if he were a monster because the days...

26:06.960 --> 26:08.760
The days where I believed
that he loved me are

26:09.640 --> 26:11.360
the shittest ones.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.600
Because I know now
that he couldn't possibly have loved me.

26:22.760 --> 26:24.280
And I'm not making excuses.

26:24.280 --> 26:27.080
I've done unforgivable things

26:27.640 --> 26:29.200
to every single one of you.

26:30.440 --> 26:34.760
It's just being back here
has made me really fucking angry, and I...

26:40.280 --> 26:43.280
Yeah, I took it out on all of you,
and it's not fair.

26:47.440 --> 26:48.360
But what is?

26:52.760 --> 26:54.360
There's something I need to say.

26:54.360 --> 26:55.760
<i>J'accuse!</i>

26:56.560 --> 26:58.040
Genevieve's got a secret toilet.

27:00.120 --> 27:03.400
Can you blame me after everything
Saskia put me through?

27:03.400 --> 27:05.400
And, I'm sorry,
that was a lovely little speech,

27:05.400 --> 27:07.920
but Saskia was a bitch before grade 12.

27:07.920 --> 27:09.440
Be that as it may, Pepé,

27:09.440 --> 27:12.200
we've been blowing mud
into literal mud for months.

27:12.200 --> 27:15.800
And after all this time,
you've had your own private pisser?

27:15.800 --> 27:17.680
And she's been hiding triple-ply.

27:19.800 --> 27:20.880
So sue me!

27:20.880 --> 27:23.040
- Vote cast!

27:23.040 --> 27:24.640
We said that we'd vote,

27:24.640 --> 27:27.320
so fucking scream if you think
that we should shave

27:27.320 --> 27:30.080
both Saskia and Genevieve's head.

27:30.080 --> 27:32.240
- What?

27:32.680 --> 27:34.040
Yes, yes, yes!

27:34.040 --> 27:35.400
- You are dead!
- Shave bitch. Shave!

27:41.160 --> 27:44.320
The reign of terror ends now!

27:59.360 --> 28:02.240
Please, please, it's just a toilet.

28:02.240 --> 28:04.240
She actually killed someone.

28:04.880 --> 28:08.760
Nothing tastes as good as baldness.

28:16.200 --> 28:17.800
Shouldn't we do
something about this?

28:17.800 --> 28:19.240
There's not much we can do.

28:19.680 --> 28:22.200
Justice, as they say, has been served.

28:22.480 --> 28:25.600
I don't do it. I don't do cardio.

28:26.880 --> 28:29.520
What's the word for when someone
does something really shitty,

28:29.520 --> 28:30.800
and gets away with it?

28:30.800 --> 28:32.000
Scot-free?

28:32.520 --> 28:33.720
I know, right?

28:33.720 --> 28:36.240
Saskia kills someone
and only cops a haircut.

28:46.920 --> 28:49.360
Shave! Shave! Shave!

29:00.200 --> 29:01.080
Girls!

29:02.960 --> 29:05.880
What in heck do you call this abomination?

29:08.080 --> 29:09.560
The power of Christ compels you.

29:15.760 --> 29:17.320
What the fuck, guys?

29:17.320 --> 29:19.920
Oh, no, don't worry. She's just a ghost.

29:20.400 --> 29:21.720
Oh, shit.

29:23.520 --> 29:25.480
I think we just killed the teacher.
