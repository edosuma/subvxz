TINA: (sighs)
Another D on a math test.

00:22.358 --> 00:24.592
And if I don't get
at least a B on the next one,

00:24.593 --> 00:26.561
I've got to go to remedial math.
(groans)

00:26.595 --> 00:28.463
Remedial math, huh?

00:28.464 --> 00:30.231
On your first day in there,
steal the biggest kid's pencil.

00:30.232 --> 00:32.433
Yeah, and then sharpen it
and give it back.

00:32.433 --> 00:33.868
What'll I tell
my grandchildren?

00:33.903 --> 00:35.536
I used to be bad at math.

00:35.537 --> 00:36.905
Oh, Grandma.

00:36.906 --> 00:38.306
I'm not going
to remedial math,

00:38.307 --> 00:39.741
because I'm going
to get a tutor

00:39.742 --> 00:41.376
who will teach me
what my teacher could not.

00:41.377 --> 00:43.311
I don't know why we're
getting yelled at.

00:44.780 --> 00:46.214
You know what's
this weekend, Bobby?

00:46.215 --> 00:48.216
Valentine's Day.
Oh, crap.

00:48.217 --> 00:50.051
I-I mean, I-I don't
mean crap, Lin.

00:50.052 --> 00:51.886
I-I know you love
Valentine's Day,

00:51.887 --> 00:53.454
I just feel like I never
get it quite right.

00:53.489 --> 00:55.423
No, you do not.
No, you're horrible at it.

00:55.424 --> 00:57.625
Well, I mean, a couple times,
I got you something nice.

00:57.626 --> 00:59.060
Remember I got the oil change?
Right.

00:59.061 --> 01:00.662
For the car?
Right, yeah.

01:00.663 --> 01:02.397
That was for you.
You did that, that was nice.

01:02.398 --> 01:03.998
Yeah.
This year,

01:03.999 --> 01:06.100
you don't have to worry,
'cause I got it all figured out.

01:06.101 --> 01:07.268
♪ Ta-da! ♪

01:07.303 --> 01:08.703
Wow. What is it?

01:08.737 --> 01:10.738
It's a Valentine's
Advent calendar.

01:10.739 --> 01:13.575
This year we're doing
Valentine's Days.

01:13.576 --> 01:15.343
Valentine's <i> Days?</i>

01:15.344 --> 01:18.346
Say good-bye to the pressure of
being super-romantic on one day,

01:18.347 --> 01:20.748
and say hello to being
somewhat-romantic

01:20.749 --> 01:22.984
for a bunch of days
leading up to the big V.

01:23.018 --> 01:25.019
Yeah!
Behind each little door

01:25.020 --> 01:27.622
is a romantic activity
that I've already thought of.

01:27.623 --> 01:29.824
Oh, you planned stuff.
That's right!

01:29.825 --> 01:31.626
Huh, all right, uh,
that sounds better.

01:31.627 --> 01:33.328
Right? Open up
day one, Bobby.

01:33.362 --> 01:35.363
Come on, (stammers)
l-let me open it.

01:35.364 --> 01:36.931
No. Teddy, get off it!
Come on, let me open it.

01:36.932 --> 01:38.199
Teddy, Teddy, give it...
Just let me open it, you can open up

01:38.200 --> 01:39.167
the other days.
Teddy, let it go.

01:39.201 --> 01:40.268
Okay, uh...

01:40.302 --> 01:41.972
"Sexy cooking."

01:42.004 --> 01:43.438
Sexy cooking...
I knew it.

01:43.439 --> 01:44.639
Yeah.

01:44.640 --> 01:46.274
I don't exactly know
what that means,

01:46.275 --> 01:48.676
but if it means I'm not gonna
screw up Valentine's Day,

01:48.677 --> 01:49.677
then I am in.

01:49.678 --> 01:50.945
I love it. We're in.

01:52.815 --> 01:54.816
DARRYL:
<i>Rosa.</i>

01:54.817 --> 01:55.984
<i>Rosa, Rosa.</i>

01:55.985 --> 01:57.852
Darryl!
Huh?! What?

01:57.853 --> 01:59.654
I need your help...
could you tutor me at math?

01:59.688 --> 02:01.156
Not taking on new clients.

02:01.157 --> 02:02.991
All my post-tutoring,
pre-video-game free time

02:02.992 --> 02:04.526
is going to robotics.

02:04.527 --> 02:06.361
I'm building a companion robot
for my grandpa.

02:06.362 --> 02:07.962
It gives him pills
and plays jazz.

02:07.997 --> 02:10.365
But if I don't get help,
I've got to go to remedial math.

02:10.399 --> 02:11.699
Ooh, that's tough. Good luck.

02:11.734 --> 02:13.334
Wait, what about tutoring me
on Saturday?

02:13.335 --> 02:15.370
I'm not going to the Valentine's
Day dance, so maybe...

02:15.371 --> 02:17.372
And you assume because I'm
a nerd, I'm not going, either?

02:17.373 --> 02:19.574
What? Oh, I'm sorry, I
assumed you weren't going

02:19.575 --> 02:21.409
for a totally
different reason.

02:21.410 --> 02:23.144
Yeah, I'm not going.
(gasps)

02:23.179 --> 02:24.479
That's it... double nerd.

02:24.513 --> 02:26.748
Huh? Come with me,
we got to talk in private.

02:26.749 --> 02:30.051
I'll tutor you if you'll be my
date to the Valentine's dance.

02:30.052 --> 02:32.420
Oh, Darryl, I'm flattered,
but I'm semi-involved

02:32.421 --> 02:33.688
with someone...
Jimmy Jr.

02:33.689 --> 02:34.989
He's semi-not-involved
with me right now,

02:34.990 --> 02:36.524
but we're working
through it.

02:36.559 --> 02:38.560
No, I don't really want
to go to the dance with you.

02:38.561 --> 02:40.462
I want to go with Rosa Batista.

02:40.496 --> 02:41.663
Then why don't you ask Rosa?

02:41.697 --> 02:43.331
I can't...
she's out of my league.

02:43.332 --> 02:44.933
I'm in seventh grade,
she's in eighth.

02:44.934 --> 02:46.568
I think she still sees me
as the little boy

02:46.569 --> 02:48.036
that peed down the slide
in second grade.

02:48.070 --> 02:49.070
Oh, that was you?

02:49.071 --> 02:50.672
I heard it was
off a swing.

02:50.673 --> 02:52.507
(sighs) Some of it may
have gotten on the swing.

02:52.508 --> 02:54.509
But listen, do you remember
who won Cupid's Couple

02:54.510 --> 02:56.511
at last year's seventh-eighth
grade Valentine's dance?

02:56.512 --> 02:59.347
Um, Michael Carlish
and Tracy Schwartz, right?

02:59.348 --> 03:01.182
And after
they broke up,

03:01.183 --> 03:04.185
seventh-grade Michael Carlish
started dating eighth-grade...

03:04.186 --> 03:06.020
BOTH:
Jenny Testa.

03:06.021 --> 03:07.522
Whoever wins Cupid's
Couple can date

03:07.523 --> 03:09.190
anyone they want
when they break up.

03:09.191 --> 03:10.759
If we fake-date,
we could win.

03:10.760 --> 03:12.026
And then if we
fake break-up,

03:12.027 --> 03:13.194
I could date Rosa,

03:13.195 --> 03:15.063
and you could
date Jimmy Jr.

03:15.064 --> 03:18.066
Hmm, but why would students vote
you and me to be Cupid's Couple?

03:18.067 --> 03:20.468
Because of the
double-nerd angle.

03:20.469 --> 03:21.903
I'm not a nerd.
You kind of are.

03:21.904 --> 03:23.738
I'm not.
We'll be too adorable to lose.

03:23.739 --> 03:25.540
A negative times a
negative is a positive.

03:25.574 --> 03:27.475
That can't be right.
We'll cover that in tutoring.

03:27.476 --> 03:28.777
So, do we have a deal?

03:28.811 --> 03:30.412
Uh...

03:30.413 --> 03:33.815
Feels kind of wrong
to mess with love.

03:33.816 --> 03:35.116
We'd have
to be careful.

03:35.117 --> 03:36.885
I've seen enough romantic
comedies to know

03:36.886 --> 03:38.887
you're probably gonna fall for me.
I won't fall for you.

03:38.888 --> 03:40.655
Okay, it's just that you're
probably gonna fall for me.

03:40.656 --> 03:42.057
Don't.
I won't.

03:42.058 --> 03:43.425
Good, fight that feeling.
I won't need to.

03:43.426 --> 03:44.626
Okay, fake boyfriend,

03:44.627 --> 03:45.827
let's fake do this.

03:47.296 --> 03:48.296
(anxious sigh)

03:49.265 --> 03:51.099
Your hand is sweaty
like a forehead.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.500
I know.
It's an issue.

03:52.501 --> 03:54.502
Oh, my God, are you
two a couple now?

03:54.503 --> 03:55.770
You do the math.
No.

03:55.771 --> 03:57.065
Um, yeah, we are.

03:58.151 --> 03:59.251
Well, nibble
my dibble.

03:59.286 --> 04:00.920
How long have y'all
been going out?

04:00.921 --> 04:01.921
A month.
Since today.

04:01.922 --> 04:03.055
Uh, since today,

04:03.056 --> 04:04.557
but earlier.
(chuckles)

04:04.558 --> 04:06.559
I never really thought
about either of you that much,

04:06.560 --> 04:08.561
but you guys make
a cute couple.

04:08.562 --> 04:09.962
Yeah, it's like neither
of you are cute,

04:09.963 --> 04:11.964
but together
you're cute.

04:11.965 --> 04:13.799
We're both humans
who wear glasses!

04:13.800 --> 04:15.234
Whoa, volume,
Darryl.

04:15.235 --> 04:16.435
Yeah, man, we're
right here.

04:16.435 --> 04:17.435
You all right,
buddy?

04:17.437 --> 04:18.637
Darryl, sweetie,

04:18.639 --> 04:19.839
will you come
with me for a sec

04:19.839 --> 04:21.474
and check my hair
for lice?

04:21.475 --> 04:23.075
Mmm-okay.
We'll be right back.

04:23.110 --> 04:25.177
Ah, I'm losing so much water
out of my palms!

04:25.178 --> 04:27.113
I'll be dead
by morning!

04:27.114 --> 04:28.914
Pull it together, Darryl!
Maybe I was wrong about this.

04:28.915 --> 04:30.516
I don't know
how to be a boyfriend.

04:30.517 --> 04:31.951
You haven't
dated anyone.

04:31.952 --> 04:33.786
And I've only dated
two-and-a-half boys,

04:33.787 --> 04:35.988
but I've thought about boys
and relationships a lot. Mm-hmm.

04:36.023 --> 04:37.089
Like, a lot.
Uh-huh.

04:37.124 --> 04:38.958
I mean,<i> a lot.</i>
Okay.

04:38.959 --> 04:40.359
So, how about this?

04:40.360 --> 04:41.794
You'll be my
math tutor,

04:41.795 --> 04:43.429
and I'll be your boyfriend tutor.
Okay.

04:43.430 --> 04:44.997
Like, if you don't
know what to say,

04:44.998 --> 04:46.265
just give me a
tiny side-hug.

04:46.266 --> 04:47.833
Uh...?
Um, oh, God.

04:47.834 --> 04:48.968
Okay, um, not
like that.

04:49.002 --> 04:51.103
Ah...?
Decent hug,

04:51.104 --> 04:52.538
but do it silently
next time.

04:52.539 --> 04:54.540
Good news,
neither of us have lice.

04:54.541 --> 04:55.775
So, hello again,
everyone.

04:55.776 --> 04:57.777
Aw, you guys look
so cute together.

04:57.778 --> 04:59.045
Thanks, Rosa.
You're welcome.

04:59.046 --> 05:00.046
(chuckles)

05:00.047 --> 05:01.047
B-Bye.

05:01.048 --> 05:02.315
B-Bye. Oh, bye.
Bye.

05:02.349 --> 05:04.784
Are Darryl and Tina
holding hands?

05:04.785 --> 05:06.852
Tina hasn't pined after
Darryl for one second.

05:06.887 --> 05:08.678
And that girl
can pine.

05:10.123 --> 05:12.291
Hey, Lin, can you take this
to table four?

05:12.292 --> 05:13.492
Aah! What the hell
was that?

05:13.493 --> 05:14.493
Sexy cooking.

05:14.494 --> 05:15.895
Oh, okay, right.

05:15.896 --> 05:17.897
She got ya!
Whipped cream.

05:17.898 --> 05:19.899
Sexy, right?
Very. Teddy.

05:19.900 --> 05:22.535
Uh, now's not really
the best time, Lin.

05:22.536 --> 05:23.636
Come here.
It's the lunch rush.

05:23.637 --> 05:25.171
Come on, come on.

05:25.172 --> 05:26.572
Also, can you take that
burger to table four?

05:26.573 --> 05:28.574
I could, or you can
try and find

05:28.575 --> 05:30.576
the strawberry I've hidden
somewhere on my body.

05:30.577 --> 05:32.578
Wh-What are you
talking about?

05:32.579 --> 05:34.580
♪ Find the strawberry ♪

05:34.581 --> 05:36.248
♪ Strawberry trail ♪

05:36.249 --> 05:37.249
Mmm, no.
♪ Yeah. ♪

05:37.250 --> 05:38.250
I don't know.

05:38.251 --> 05:39.385
Not right now.

05:39.386 --> 05:40.820
Wait, is that it,
right there?

05:40.821 --> 05:42.021
In your apron pocket?

05:42.022 --> 05:43.389
Mm-hmm.
So it's in there.

05:43.390 --> 05:44.590
Yeah, come and get it.

05:44.591 --> 05:46.225
Well, it's all
dirty now,

05:46.226 --> 05:48.227
'cause it's in your apron
with a dirty dishrag.

05:48.228 --> 05:49.428
So dirty.

05:49.429 --> 05:50.863
Hurry up,
it's getting all mushy.

05:50.864 --> 05:52.498
Well, I don't
really want to now,

05:52.499 --> 05:54.500
it has a dishrag on it.
Sure you do.

05:54.501 --> 05:56.068
I really don't. I don't want that one.
You know you want to.

05:56.069 --> 05:57.103
No.
Open up...

05:57.104 --> 05:58.337
Mm-mm, mm-mm.
Open up.

05:58.338 --> 05:59.739
No.
Fine, I'll take a nibble.

05:59.740 --> 06:01.607
Mmm.
(gags)

06:01.608 --> 06:02.675
Lin, you're gagging.

06:02.676 --> 06:03.743
(groans)

06:05.212 --> 06:07.613
Tina, hey, back
from tutoring, I see.

06:07.614 --> 06:10.383
Have a seat, my sister.
Sure.

06:10.417 --> 06:12.618
So, Darryl, boyfriend, you, girlfriend?
Mm-hmm.

06:12.619 --> 06:13.853
Really?
Really.

06:13.854 --> 06:15.254
Okay, you broke me!

06:15.255 --> 06:16.689
Darryl and I are
pretending we're dating

06:16.690 --> 06:18.190
so we can win Cupid's
Couple at the dance,

06:18.191 --> 06:19.759
and then we can go out
with whoever we want,

06:19.760 --> 06:20.860
and I stay in
normal math.

06:20.861 --> 06:22.595
I knew math was
responsible!

06:22.596 --> 06:23.629
Please don't tell.

06:23.630 --> 06:24.630
If anyone knows
we're faking,

06:24.631 --> 06:25.698
then we won't win.

06:25.699 --> 06:26.699
Right. Bribe, please.

06:26.700 --> 06:28.100
(sighs)
Okay.

06:28.101 --> 06:30.102
Well, the winners of
Cupid's Couple get

06:30.103 --> 06:32.038
a $50 frozen
yogurt gift card.

06:32.039 --> 06:33.739
I guess you guys can
have that if we win.

06:33.740 --> 06:37.610
Shh... You had me at "gets a
$50 frozen yogurt gift card."

06:37.644 --> 06:41.647
Now, a boyfriend should always
give his girlfriend compliments.

06:41.648 --> 06:44.083
Like, you could tell me I did a
great job of opening my locker

06:44.084 --> 06:45.084
on the first try.

06:45.118 --> 06:46.352
I should compliment you on that?

06:46.386 --> 06:47.787
Especially that.

06:47.788 --> 06:49.388
My locker has a mind of its own,
which I respect,

06:49.389 --> 06:51.190
but also sometimes
I just need to get my books.

06:51.224 --> 06:52.391
Uh, okay.

06:52.392 --> 06:53.793
Hey, great job
opening your locker

06:53.794 --> 06:55.795
on the first try, Tina.
Oh, thanks.

06:55.796 --> 06:58.230
Whoa, that is some sweet talk.
I know, right?

06:58.231 --> 07:00.232
It's so cute how their glasses
reflect off each other.

07:00.233 --> 07:02.234
Yeah, like two mirrors
that go on forever.

07:02.235 --> 07:04.036
Infinite stuff
trips me out!

07:04.071 --> 07:05.972
Oh, no, there's a
spider on your back.

07:06.006 --> 07:08.040
Ew! Get it off!
Get it off!

07:08.075 --> 07:09.442
No, it's not real, it's my hand.

07:09.443 --> 07:10.876
It's a cute game we play,
it's our thing.

07:10.911 --> 07:12.712
But I hate spiders,
could it be a beetle?

07:12.746 --> 07:13.946
Sure. Oh, no.

07:13.947 --> 07:15.147
There's a beetle
on your back.

07:15.148 --> 07:16.415
(chuckles)

07:16.416 --> 07:18.818
Aw! Bugs are, like,
the new hugs.

07:18.819 --> 07:21.454
Cupid sure hit that couple
right in the rump, huh?

07:21.455 --> 07:24.090
It's the romance
of the century!

07:24.091 --> 07:26.092
And it has nothing
to do with yogurt.

07:31.665 --> 07:33.532
I'm having a really good
time with you tonight.

07:33.533 --> 07:35.001
I don't think
everyone heard you.

07:35.002 --> 07:37.003
You got to yell over the music.
Oh, right.

07:37.004 --> 07:38.638
(louder): I'm having a really
good time with you tonight.

07:38.639 --> 07:40.840
Oh, man, look at Chloe
and Zack slow dance.

07:40.874 --> 07:42.308
They are so slow!

07:42.309 --> 07:43.943
Wow, they're
barely moving.

07:43.977 --> 07:45.177
How do we compete
with that?

07:45.178 --> 07:47.179
We cannot let them win
Cupid's Couple.

07:47.180 --> 07:48.781
Hold on,
I got a good idea.

07:48.815 --> 07:52.285
Hey, who's having
a great Valentine's Day?

07:52.286 --> 07:53.986
(shouting in affirmation)

07:54.021 --> 07:56.455
Well, I'm having a greater time,

07:56.456 --> 07:59.058
because I'm here with the number
one girlfriend in the world.

07:59.059 --> 08:01.827
Ti-na Bel-cher!

08:01.862 --> 08:03.763
Hi.

08:03.797 --> 08:06.799
Aw, I want someone to stretch
out my name like that.

08:06.800 --> 08:10.169
Joce-lynn...!

08:10.203 --> 08:13.205
Deejay, slow-jam me.

08:13.206 --> 08:14.206

08:34.895 --> 08:36.128
Aw...

08:36.163 --> 08:38.364
Wow, Darryl, where did
that come from?

08:38.365 --> 08:39.365
Girlfriends like
surprises.

08:39.366 --> 08:40.765
You taught me that.

08:40.767 --> 08:42.568
Hey, you know what might push
us over the top right now?

08:42.568 --> 08:44.003
A kiss.
Great idea.

08:44.004 --> 08:45.271
Let's make this look real.

08:48.226 --> 08:50.394
(whooping, applause)

08:50.428 --> 08:53.263
Wow, who knew Darryl was
total boyfriend material?

08:53.264 --> 08:54.765
I know.

08:54.766 --> 08:57.067
I didn't know, but
now I know, you know?

08:57.101 --> 08:58.468
We're gonna win
this thing.

08:58.469 --> 09:00.237
We should probably
kiss one more time.

09:00.238 --> 09:01.571
Just in case someone was tying
their shoes and missed it.

09:01.572 --> 09:03.006
Right, good thinking.

09:03.007 --> 09:05.042
(Darryl moans)

09:05.076 --> 09:07.077
So are you ready to see

09:07.078 --> 09:09.479
what we got for actual
Valentine's Day?

09:09.480 --> 09:11.114
I don't know
if I am ready.

09:11.115 --> 09:12.749
It's, uh, it's been
a rough week.

09:12.750 --> 09:14.751
Yeah.
We've had some misfires.

09:14.752 --> 09:16.620
And an actual fire, yeah.
Yeah.

09:16.654 --> 09:18.255
Ooh, "Bubble Bath"!

09:18.289 --> 09:20.123
Well, it's hard
to mess up a bubble bath.

09:20.124 --> 09:22.125
And Gene and Louise
are asleep,

09:22.126 --> 09:23.626
so that sounds good.

09:24.595 --> 09:26.129
Oh, Bobby.

09:26.164 --> 09:27.764
Oh, hello, there.

09:27.799 --> 09:28.799
Get in here, you.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.634
It's nice and bubbly.

09:30.668 --> 09:32.969
Yeah, there's
a lot of bubbles.

09:33.004 --> 09:34.137
Yeah, I used the whole bottle.

09:34.172 --> 09:35.539
You used the whole bottle?

09:35.540 --> 09:36.506
You're supposed to use,
like, a teaspoon.

09:36.507 --> 09:37.874
It's, like, toxic.
No.

09:37.875 --> 09:39.776
All right, fine,
fine, it's fine.

09:39.811 --> 09:40.877
It's just a
lot of bubbles.

09:40.878 --> 09:42.012
Come on, it's fun.

09:42.013 --> 09:43.180
It's like a
paste in here.

09:43.181 --> 09:44.648
Yeah, right?!

09:44.649 --> 09:45.849
Feels like no water.
Look at that.

09:45.850 --> 09:47.284
Oh.
Let's just go with it.

09:47.285 --> 09:48.485
Yeah.

09:48.486 --> 09:50.487
But it stings.
Just ignore it.

09:50.488 --> 09:52.122
Yeah, when it gets in
your eyes, it stings.

09:52.123 --> 09:53.357
Ignore it.

09:53.358 --> 09:54.725
Come on, look at me.

09:54.726 --> 09:56.360
I'm just gonna get
out for a sec, Lin.

09:56.361 --> 09:57.594
No...
I got to wash

09:57.628 --> 09:58.628
my face off.
Gene! Ooh!

09:58.629 --> 09:59.629
I thought
you were asleep.

09:59.630 --> 10:01.031
I thought I was, too.

10:01.032 --> 10:02.833
But then my bladder
was, like, "Get up!"

10:02.834 --> 10:04.701
(yawns) What's
going on in here?

10:04.736 --> 10:06.770
Oh, God, no, Louise,
you got to get out.

10:06.804 --> 10:07.871
I'm peeing, but after,

10:07.872 --> 10:09.039
I'm gonna make
a sandwich

10:09.040 --> 10:10.240
and join Mom and
Dad in the tub.

10:10.241 --> 10:11.241
Ooh, what kind
of sandwich?

10:11.242 --> 10:12.309
N-No, Lin, no.

10:12.343 --> 10:13.977
Well, now I got to pee.

10:13.978 --> 10:15.379
Use the second toilet.

10:15.380 --> 10:17.180
Mom, Dad, can you
get out for a second?

10:17.215 --> 10:18.415
Do you pee in here?

10:18.416 --> 10:19.683
Yeah.
You're kidding me.

10:19.717 --> 10:21.818
Well, no.
I'm in it.

10:21.819 --> 10:23.153
Well, I... that's why
I'm asking you

10:23.154 --> 10:24.621
to please get out
for just a minute.

10:24.655 --> 10:25.722
Couple three.

10:25.723 --> 10:27.190
(light applause)

10:27.191 --> 10:28.725
And couple four.

10:28.726 --> 10:30.494
(applause)

10:30.495 --> 10:33.063
All right, looks like the winner
of Cupid's Couple is...

10:33.064 --> 10:35.098
Darryl and Tina!

10:35.099 --> 10:37.734
Don't fly away,
because you get

10:37.735 --> 10:41.038
a $50 gift card
to Fro-Yo-Momma.

10:41.072 --> 10:42.272
We did it.
I know.

10:42.273 --> 10:43.473
Girls are smiling at me.

10:43.508 --> 10:44.875
The theorem's working.

10:44.909 --> 10:46.443
Let's kiss one more time
to seal the deal.

10:46.444 --> 10:47.944
We already won.

10:47.945 --> 10:49.446
Where's Rosa?
I can't see Rosa.

10:49.447 --> 10:50.747
And one more time,
for old time's sake.

10:50.748 --> 10:52.549
All right, well, I...

10:52.550 --> 10:53.717
Okay one more.

10:53.718 --> 10:55.218
I guess...

10:55.219 --> 10:57.020
Wait, that...
let's redo that one.

10:59.988 --> 11:01.122
So, now what?

11:01.123 --> 11:02.357
You and Darryl break up?

11:02.358 --> 11:03.691
And then Jimmy Jr.
comes running?

11:03.692 --> 11:05.393
And Rosa
and my math scores,

11:05.394 --> 11:07.328
according to Darryl's theory,
which is probably right,

11:07.329 --> 11:08.896
since he's the smartest boy
I've ever dated.

11:08.897 --> 11:10.498
Fake dated.
Right, right. Fake dated.

11:10.532 --> 11:13.368
So, the breakup, is it
gonna be classy or nasty?

11:13.402 --> 11:16.037
Definitely nasty. Want to know
how many holds will be barred?

11:16.038 --> 11:16.971
Three?
None.

11:16.972 --> 11:18.206
Wow, that is...

11:18.207 --> 11:19.407
so few.

11:21.477 --> 11:22.810
You ready to do this?

11:22.811 --> 11:24.312
Maybe we should
practice more.

11:24.313 --> 11:26.180
What if we break up
tomorrow or next month?

11:26.181 --> 11:28.216
Nah, we got this.
Showtime.

11:28.217 --> 11:29.484
For you, my sweets.

11:29.485 --> 11:31.753
A gardenia?
My favorite flower?

11:31.754 --> 11:33.488
Aah, that's it!
I can't take it anymore!

11:33.489 --> 11:34.756
What do you mean?

11:34.757 --> 11:36.190
You're just too kind
and generous.

11:36.191 --> 11:37.492
It's making me sick.
Oh, yeah?

11:37.493 --> 11:38.559
Well, you're too
damn interesting,

11:38.594 --> 11:40.161
and it's driving me nuts.

11:40.162 --> 11:41.763
What's going on here?
Cupid's Couple is having

11:41.764 --> 11:42.997
a quarrel and a half.

11:42.998 --> 11:44.532
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

11:44.533 --> 11:46.501
Your charisma
is overwhelming me!

11:46.502 --> 11:48.903
Why can't you be un-charming
for one damn second?

11:48.904 --> 11:50.605
I can't change
how incredible I am.

11:50.606 --> 11:52.840
Just like you can't change
how phenomenal you are.

11:52.841 --> 11:55.476
Then maybe we shouldn't date
each other anymore.

11:55.511 --> 11:57.045
(crowd gasping)
You mean break up,

11:57.046 --> 11:58.546
effective immediately?

11:58.547 --> 12:00.715
And date other people at this
and/or other schools?

12:00.716 --> 12:02.283
It's our only choice!

12:02.284 --> 12:04.452
I wish I knew how to tame you,
you wild stallion!

12:04.453 --> 12:07.221
Have a great life.
You too, soulful wonder lady.

12:07.222 --> 12:09.290
Hey, Rosa,
sorry you had to see that.

12:09.291 --> 12:10.725
Man, that was rough.

12:10.726 --> 12:12.427
Are you okay, Darryl?
I'll be all right.

12:12.428 --> 12:13.895
(voice breaking): Thanks for asking.
You're welcome.

12:13.896 --> 12:15.897
That was so intense.

12:15.898 --> 12:17.932
I thought they were going
to last forever and ever.

12:17.933 --> 12:20.635
But instead they just imploded
right before our eyes.

12:20.636 --> 12:22.403
So, Tina's single again?

12:22.404 --> 12:23.905
Why do you want to know?

12:23.906 --> 12:25.440
I-I don't care.

12:25.441 --> 12:26.975
Jimmy Jr. likes Tina!

12:26.976 --> 12:29.010
No, I don't.

12:29.044 --> 12:30.845
Look at Rosa and Darryl.

12:30.879 --> 12:33.214
That happened fast.
The kid's a genius.

12:33.215 --> 12:34.949
Yeah, they're really
hitting it off, those two.

12:34.950 --> 12:36.117
Good for them.

12:36.151 --> 12:37.919
Hey, Tina.
Hello, Jimmy Jr.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.654
A bunch of us
are going bowling tonight,

12:39.655 --> 12:41.923
and since you and Darryl
aren't a couple anymore,

12:41.924 --> 12:43.625
I was wondering
if you want to come.

12:43.626 --> 12:45.593
Bowling?
Did someone say nachos?

12:45.628 --> 12:47.295
Um, I was kind of talking
to Tina.

12:47.296 --> 12:48.763
This is just for older kids.

12:48.764 --> 12:50.832
Tina is insisting
that we go with her

12:50.833 --> 12:52.300
and that she pay for us,

12:52.301 --> 12:54.102
because we know so much
about <i> bowling.</i>

12:54.103 --> 12:55.803
Some might say too much.

12:55.804 --> 12:57.438
Wait, I don't get it.
How could you know

12:57.439 --> 12:58.840
About...
too much about bowling?

12:58.841 --> 13:00.742
We know too much about...

13:00.743 --> 13:02.777
Bowling.
No.

13:02.778 --> 13:04.812
It's something else.
Bowling.

13:04.813 --> 13:06.414
Uh-huh.
So, I'm gonna take off.

13:06.415 --> 13:08.316
Uh, well see you tonight.
JIMMY JR.: Yeah.

13:08.317 --> 13:09.984
We know too much
about the Cupid's Couple thing.

13:09.985 --> 13:11.152
Oh! Okay.

13:11.153 --> 13:12.387
Yeah, you can come.

13:12.421 --> 13:14.322
LINDA:
<i>Look what's back.</i>

13:14.356 --> 13:16.357
No, no, no.
Yes, yes, yes.

13:16.358 --> 13:18.126
Since the kids are out,

13:18.127 --> 13:20.628
and the bubble bath was a
little too bubbly for some,

13:20.629 --> 13:22.297
we're gonna finish strong with...
No.

13:22.298 --> 13:23.865
Striptease.
Oh.

13:23.866 --> 13:25.099
Yeah. Ooh!
Yeah.

13:25.100 --> 13:26.701
That could be fun.
I'd like that.

13:26.702 --> 13:28.703
I'd like that, too.
See you strut your stuff.

13:28.704 --> 13:29.938
Wait, me?
Yeah.

13:29.939 --> 13:31.206
Magic Mike me, baby.

13:31.207 --> 13:32.540
(chuckles)
Lin, you don't want that.

13:32.541 --> 13:33.975
Oh, but I do.

13:33.976 --> 13:35.443
Really? Okay.

13:35.444 --> 13:37.145
Then I'll do it.
Yeah! Do it.

13:37.146 --> 13:40.381
But if I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna really do it, Lin.

13:40.382 --> 13:41.883
I'm gonna go all in.
Bobby!

13:41.884 --> 13:44.185
If Bob Belcher strips,
he's gonna strip serious.

13:44.186 --> 13:45.486
Like what? Like how?

13:45.487 --> 13:47.455
Like crazy.
Like you've never seen,

13:47.456 --> 13:49.224
like you wa...
you won't even want it.

13:49.225 --> 13:51.626
Yeah!
After 20 seconds of my striptease,

13:51.627 --> 13:53.461
you're gonna...
you'll want to leave.

13:53.462 --> 13:55.463
(whoops) I'm gonna
go shave my chest

13:55.464 --> 13:57.365
and pick out some music.
Let's do it!

13:57.399 --> 13:59.067
Oh, maybe brush your teeth, too.
Oh, right.

13:59.068 --> 14:00.802
Maybe floss. Okay.
Yes.

14:00.803 --> 14:03.137
LOUISE:
<i>On your marks,</i>

14:03.138 --> 14:04.973
get set, go.

14:06.575 --> 14:08.476
Yeah!
MAN: Lane five, don't do that.

14:08.477 --> 14:10.178
What, don't bowl?

14:10.179 --> 14:13.014
Hm, feels like
there's a strike in here.

14:13.015 --> 14:15.049
Huh. Those cheeks
aren't leaving me weak

14:15.050 --> 14:16.050
like they usually do.

14:16.085 --> 14:18.019
(groans)

14:18.020 --> 14:19.420
Hell, yeah!
Boom shaka-laka!

14:19.421 --> 14:20.555
That's my boy!

14:20.556 --> 14:21.689
Get over here!

14:21.724 --> 14:23.892
Come on. Get over here.
Ow.

14:23.893 --> 14:25.360
Ow, ow, ow! Zeke, ow.

14:25.361 --> 14:26.761
(laughter)

14:28.831 --> 14:30.732
Oh, Darryl.

14:30.766 --> 14:32.367
(growling)
Come on!

14:32.401 --> 14:33.835
Come on!
Ow, Zeke, ow!

14:33.836 --> 14:35.336
That's too rough.
Come on!

14:35.337 --> 14:36.571
Rosa, don't move.

14:36.572 --> 14:37.939
There's a huge beetle
on your back.

14:37.940 --> 14:39.841
Oh, no. Aah!
(laughter)

14:39.842 --> 14:41.442
I love it when you do that.

14:41.443 --> 14:43.344
That's-that's my favorite joke
thing that we do.

14:43.345 --> 14:44.746
That's it!

14:44.747 --> 14:46.347
Oh, I can't take it anymore!

14:46.348 --> 14:47.515
Are you okay, Tina?

14:47.516 --> 14:48.883
Yeah, your face does not look

14:48.884 --> 14:50.718
exactly normal for a human.

14:50.719 --> 14:52.053
No, I'm not okay!

14:52.087 --> 14:53.388
Yeah, 'cause seriously,

14:53.389 --> 14:55.223
your expression is like...
(growls)

14:55.257 --> 14:56.458
None of this is okay, okay?

14:56.459 --> 14:57.625
I'm tired of lying.

14:57.626 --> 14:58.860
You need to know the truth.

14:58.861 --> 15:00.128
Tina, what are you doing?

15:00.129 --> 15:01.563
Oh, boy.
Everyone...

15:01.597 --> 15:03.431
Darryl and I only pretended
to be a couple,

15:03.432 --> 15:04.499
so he could trick Rosa

15:04.533 --> 15:05.700
into dating him.

15:05.701 --> 15:07.102
And he would tutor me in math,

15:07.103 --> 15:08.970
but we didn't get around
to much of that.

15:08.971 --> 15:11.072
We lied to you,
and you all fell for it.

15:11.107 --> 15:12.674
That's weird. I'm outta here.

15:12.708 --> 15:14.042
Darryl, is this true?

15:14.043 --> 15:16.411
Uh... Kind of?

15:16.412 --> 15:19.080
Well, then I kind of never
want to see you again.

15:19.081 --> 15:21.116
Rosa, come back!

15:21.117 --> 15:22.517
Tina, what the hell
are you doing?

15:22.551 --> 15:24.452
Um, I-I guess...

15:24.453 --> 15:25.987
I guess...
You guess what?

15:25.988 --> 15:27.389
I guess I fell for you.

15:27.390 --> 15:28.556
(crowd gasping)

15:28.557 --> 15:30.592
What?! But we were pretending!

15:30.626 --> 15:32.394
Well, I wasn't. (groans)

15:32.395 --> 15:34.562
What a tangle-assed web
we weave.

15:34.563 --> 15:35.730
(pins crashing)

15:38.099 --> 15:40.067
You fell for me? How? Why?

15:40.068 --> 15:42.236
Because you did nice things
and said nice things,

15:42.237 --> 15:44.071
and we had our special
side hug thing.

15:44.072 --> 15:46.006
You told me
to do those things.

15:46.007 --> 15:47.474
Well, can't you
just be that guy?

15:47.475 --> 15:49.109
No, that guy
doesn't even exist.

15:49.110 --> 15:51.345
But you fell for the Tina
I was when we were together.

15:51.346 --> 15:53.013
No, I didn't.

15:53.014 --> 15:54.581
Let's assume you did and
work backwards from there.

15:54.582 --> 15:56.850
No, Tina, we don't even
like the same stuff.

15:56.851 --> 15:57.951
Sure we do.

15:57.952 --> 15:59.119
Do you like math?
No.

15:59.120 --> 16:00.287
And video games?
No...

16:00.288 --> 16:01.588
And comic books?
No.

16:01.589 --> 16:03.090
And going to the science museum?
No...

16:03.091 --> 16:04.458
You know who likes
all those things?

16:04.459 --> 16:05.526
Who?
Rosa!

16:05.527 --> 16:06.960
Rosa likes all that stuff!

16:06.961 --> 16:08.629
Oh, God,
you and Rosa should be together.

16:08.630 --> 16:10.197
Yes, we should.

16:10.198 --> 16:12.132
I broke up
a perfectly good relationship.

16:12.133 --> 16:13.300
Yes, you did.

16:13.301 --> 16:14.635
I need to get
you two back together.

16:14.669 --> 16:15.969
Yes, you do.

16:15.970 --> 16:17.538
Oh, boy. I hope I'm as good

16:17.539 --> 16:18.639
at getting you guys
back together

16:18.640 --> 16:19.974
as I was at breaking you up.

16:19.975 --> 16:21.642
Go, go, go, go, go!

16:21.676 --> 16:23.277
LINDA:
<i>You're taking forever in there.</i>

16:23.278 --> 16:25.245
You better not be using
all my baby oil.

16:25.280 --> 16:26.680
BOB:
Okay, I'm coming out.

16:26.681 --> 16:28.382
I started to shave,
but I stopped.

16:28.383 --> 16:29.650
So don't look at my back.

16:29.651 --> 16:31.251
Okay. Should I hit play, or...?

16:31.286 --> 16:32.486
Not yet.

16:32.487 --> 16:33.954
(groans):
Oh, G... Oh, my God.

16:33.955 --> 16:35.856
That's really tight. Okay now.

16:35.890 --> 16:37.224
Now, go.
(whoops)

16:37.225 --> 16:38.459
(music playing)
Party time.

16:38.460 --> 16:40.794
Well, well, (panting) well.

16:40.795 --> 16:42.162
Ha ha!
Did someone...

16:42.163 --> 16:43.831
Just give me a second.
You all right?

16:43.832 --> 16:45.633
All right, let me just come right back.
Okay.

16:45.634 --> 16:47.234
All right, go, go...
Just stop the music for a second.

16:47.235 --> 16:48.669
I'll be right back.
All right.

16:48.703 --> 16:50.304
I'm gonna look away.
All right put it on.

16:50.305 --> 16:52.339
I'm ready, I'm ready.
Here we go and play.

16:52.340 --> 16:54.041
Hey, there, lady.

16:54.042 --> 16:57.311
Did someone order take out,
or should I say take off?

16:58.046 --> 16:59.680
Oh, yeah.

16:59.681 --> 17:01.148
How do you like that? Mm.

17:01.149 --> 17:02.483
(whoops)
Oh, you like it?

17:02.517 --> 17:04.484
Yeah!
Well, it's just getting started.

17:04.519 --> 17:06.553
Let's get it down and dirty.

17:06.554 --> 17:08.255
Take it off, baby! (whoops)

17:08.256 --> 17:09.256
Yeah!

17:09.257 --> 17:11.492
(whooping)
Ha, ha!

17:11.526 --> 17:13.894
How's this working for you?
'Cause this is my one move.

17:13.895 --> 17:15.829
Give it to mama.
Let's orbit the Earth.

17:15.829 --> 17:17.364
Let's orbit the Earth.

17:17.398 --> 17:18.598
I like it. It's circular.

17:18.599 --> 17:19.700
Round. I'm getting dizzy.

17:19.733 --> 17:20.901
Yeah, yeah.

17:20.902 --> 17:22.102
No, this is what I practiced.

17:22.103 --> 17:23.270
Oh.
Oh, yeah.

17:23.271 --> 17:24.605
Let's go the other way.

17:24.606 --> 17:26.339
Going counter-clockwise.

17:26.340 --> 17:28.008
MAN (outside):
You're terrible!

17:28.009 --> 17:29.944
Did you just hear something?
Nah, nah, keep going.

17:29.945 --> 17:31.345
I think it's in the song.
Keep going.

17:31.346 --> 17:32.413
DENNIS:
Put on some clothes, big boy!

17:32.414 --> 17:33.514
Oh, my God.

17:33.515 --> 17:34.848
The curtain's open.

17:34.849 --> 17:36.050
Oh, God.
What happened to your back?

17:36.051 --> 17:37.384
Nobody wants to see that.
(laughing)

17:37.385 --> 17:39.253
Hey! I do!

17:39.254 --> 17:40.955
Sorry.
I was doing a striptease

17:40.956 --> 17:43.090
for my wife
for Valentine's Day, all right?

17:43.124 --> 17:44.391
Valentine's Day was days ago.

17:44.392 --> 17:45.559
Give it up.

17:45.594 --> 17:46.694
All right, fine.

17:46.695 --> 17:47.928
I'm closing the curtains.

17:47.929 --> 17:49.330
Oh, no.

17:49.364 --> 17:50.864
Crap. They're not closing.

17:50.865 --> 17:52.299
I'm sorry, Bobby.

17:52.300 --> 17:55.302
This Valentine's Days thing
was a bad idea.

17:55.303 --> 17:56.971
We just stink at it.

17:56.972 --> 17:58.706
We stink.
No, no, Lin, you know what?

17:58.707 --> 18:00.908
I said I was gonna do it,
so I'm gonna do it.

18:00.909 --> 18:02.543
All right?
I'm gonna do it.

18:02.544 --> 18:03.911
Yeah?
Take a seat, Lin.

18:03.912 --> 18:05.779
I'm going back on the table.

18:05.780 --> 18:07.848
Do it! (laughs)
(whooping)

18:07.883 --> 18:09.083
Ow!
(music resumes)

18:09.084 --> 18:10.818
Orbit the Earth.
Orbit the Earth.

18:10.819 --> 18:13.320
Oh, Bobby,
spin me right round.

18:13.321 --> 18:15.055
It's all coming off, baby!

18:15.056 --> 18:16.757
Ass!

18:16.758 --> 18:19.727
Rosa? Rosa? There you are.

18:19.728 --> 18:21.262
It's okay you didn't
say anything back

18:21.263 --> 18:23.731
when I called your name
all those times.

18:23.765 --> 18:25.266
Look, Darryl lied
about liking me,

18:25.267 --> 18:26.767
but he didn't lie
about liking you.

18:26.768 --> 18:28.235
You gotta give him
another chance.

18:28.236 --> 18:29.603
Why should I?

18:29.604 --> 18:31.438
Because Darryl and I were
a great fake couple,

18:31.439 --> 18:33.474
but you and Darryl can be
a great real couple.

18:33.475 --> 18:35.342
And why would we be
a great real couple?

18:35.343 --> 18:36.810
'Cause you're looking at me

18:36.811 --> 18:38.479
and you're still blasting
lizard guys like crazy.

18:38.480 --> 18:39.680
They're not lizards.
They're snakes.

18:39.681 --> 18:41.515
And technically,
they're actually

18:41.516 --> 18:43.117
demons from the black castle.
Demons from the black castle.

18:43.151 --> 18:45.719
Ugh! I came here
to get away from you.

18:45.754 --> 18:47.621
An arcade might not be
the best place

18:47.622 --> 18:48.889
to get away from Darryl.

18:48.924 --> 18:50.457
Rosa, will you
press two-players

18:50.458 --> 18:52.459
with Darryl for one game
and see how it goes?

18:52.494 --> 18:53.994
No. No way.

18:53.995 --> 18:55.296
He tricked me into liking him.

18:55.297 --> 18:56.997
No. I realize now

18:56.998 --> 18:58.566
the only people that got tricked
were me and Darryl.

18:58.600 --> 18:59.633
You and Darryl?

18:59.668 --> 19:01.101
I tricked myself into falling

19:01.102 --> 19:02.937
for a version of Darryl
that I created.

19:02.938 --> 19:04.338
Then Darryl tricked himself

19:04.339 --> 19:05.973
into being confident enough
to talk to you.

19:05.974 --> 19:07.708
Ugh!
Leave me alone, all right?

19:07.709 --> 19:09.977
Forget it, Tina; Rosa's back
to being out of my league.

19:10.011 --> 19:12.379
Damn it, there are no leagues!

19:12.380 --> 19:14.882
VOICE (over P.A.): League bowling will
now begin on lanes nine through 12.

19:14.883 --> 19:16.283
Okay, except bowling leagues.

19:16.284 --> 19:17.818
But there shouldn't be
people leagues.

19:17.853 --> 19:19.820
But there are, Tina;
That's just how it is.

19:19.821 --> 19:21.021
You're the one who thought you
were out of Rosa's league.

19:21.022 --> 19:22.823
Not Rosa.

19:22.824 --> 19:24.859
Why, because you peed on
the slide in second grade?

19:24.860 --> 19:26.660
You're the only one
still holding onto that.

19:26.661 --> 19:28.496
No, I totally remember.

19:28.530 --> 19:30.331
Okay, so you and Jocelyn,
and I remember, too.

19:30.332 --> 19:31.899
The point is, Darryl,
if you liked Rosa,

19:31.900 --> 19:33.667
then you should have just gone
and talked to her.

19:33.668 --> 19:35.369
Even if she remembered
the pee thing.

19:35.403 --> 19:37.438
Could you just, um,
stop bringing that up? Right.

19:37.472 --> 19:38.672
The pee thing?
Yes.

19:38.707 --> 19:40.674
(sighs)
Rosa, I'm sorry.

19:40.675 --> 19:42.743
I should have just told you
I liked you.

19:42.744 --> 19:45.679
Yes, you should have. So will you
guys press two player already?

19:45.680 --> 19:48.082
Are you crazy? I'm on the black castle
level! She's on the black castle level!

19:48.083 --> 19:50.017
Oh. We said the same thing
at the same time.

19:50.018 --> 19:51.752
You know there's
a hidden power-up on that level.

19:51.753 --> 19:52.820
Nuh-uh. Really?

19:52.821 --> 19:54.688
Want me to show you?
Yes.

19:54.723 --> 19:56.857
GIRLS: Aw.
They're like Mario and Luigi.

19:56.858 --> 19:58.092
They're so in love.

19:58.093 --> 20:00.194
Dang it, Tina's inspired me.

20:00.195 --> 20:01.495
Jocelyn?
What?

20:01.496 --> 20:02.863
Could you scooch out of the way?

20:02.864 --> 20:04.765
I want to ask out
that shoe rental woman.

20:04.766 --> 20:06.267
She's like 35, Zeke.

20:06.268 --> 20:07.701
And she's wearing
a wedding ring.

20:07.702 --> 20:09.236
So? No leagues.

20:09.271 --> 20:10.905
I'm the only one
holding me back,

20:10.906 --> 20:12.506
because I think
I'm too bow-legged.

20:12.507 --> 20:14.208
But I'm not.
Just the right amount.

20:14.209 --> 20:16.710
So let me waddle over here
and just ask her out right now.

20:16.711 --> 20:17.878
Hey, baby!

20:17.913 --> 20:19.246
Well, mission accomplished.

20:19.247 --> 20:20.548
Absolutely.

20:20.549 --> 20:22.383
Except that Jimmy Jr.
ran out on you.

20:22.384 --> 20:24.485
And you're probably gonna fail
that math test.

20:24.519 --> 20:26.353
No. I may have failed Jimmy Jr.,

20:26.354 --> 20:28.055
but I'm not going
to fail the math test.

20:28.056 --> 20:29.223
I'm gonna ace it.

20:29.224 --> 20:30.524
