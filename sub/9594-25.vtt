00:35.769 --> 00:38.606
Okay, Titans, the H.I.V.E. is
planning something big.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.674
I'll stand guard,
while you gather intel.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.343
Keep your communicators handy.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.644
I'll call in case they return.

00:43.677 --> 00:46.514
Um... That's gonna be
a problem actually.

00:46.547 --> 00:49.717
BEAST BOY:
Hey, Ray,
what's your 20? Over.

00:49.750 --> 00:52.753
Something's wrong with your
communicator, over.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.190
Over and out.

00:56.224 --> 00:57.325
Then we do it old school.

00:57.358 --> 00:58.492
If you spot the H.I.V.E.

00:58.526 --> 00:59.727
just give a little whistle.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.062
The cutest form
of communication.

01:02.463 --> 01:03.464
Um...

01:03.497 --> 01:06.434
Let's do it!

01:06.467 --> 01:09.403
Just a little whistle.

01:09.437 --> 01:10.471
No problem...

01:17.711 --> 01:20.148
Is that the whistling sign
from Robin?

01:23.617 --> 01:25.319
I think that's a dying bird.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.858
Sounds more like someone
stepped on a jelly donut.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.126
That's a wet fart...

01:38.732 --> 01:42.170
Did you not hear me when
I said give a little whistle.

01:42.203 --> 01:43.604
I was whistling.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.206
But the weather was weird
and my lips were chapped...

01:45.239 --> 01:46.574
Can you even whistle?

01:46.607 --> 01:48.176
Of course I can.

01:56.584 --> 01:58.352
Robin, please stop.

01:58.386 --> 01:59.920
Dude, you have to be
able to whistle.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.723
How else are you gonna
be able to
hail cabs or call dogs?

02:04.658 --> 02:06.827
-That's a good doggy.

02:06.860 --> 02:09.763
The truth is I would never
devote a moment

02:09.797 --> 02:12.500
of my precious time to
the pursuit of something

02:12.533 --> 02:14.468
as stupid as whistling.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.204
Never!

02:16.237 --> 02:18.439
-Perhaps I can teach you
the whistle, Robin.
-I'm in.

02:18.472 --> 02:22.476
This is the perfect
environment for the whistling.

02:22.510 --> 02:24.178
No distractions.

02:24.212 --> 02:25.313
Plenty of air.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.580
Now observe.

02:37.325 --> 02:38.659
So beautiful.

02:38.692 --> 02:39.960
-That hair.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.562
Those eyes.

02:41.595 --> 02:44.632
What a fascinating way
to describe the whistle.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.967
Did it have the full lips
as well?

02:48.302 --> 02:49.403
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

02:49.437 --> 02:51.305
Now it is your turn.

02:51.339 --> 02:53.207
Simply control a stream of air

02:53.241 --> 02:55.809
by pressing
your lips together.

02:55.843 --> 02:58.212
Like this?

03:00.914 --> 03:02.250
No, like this.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.353
You can whistle, Robin.

03:05.386 --> 03:06.687
I believe in you.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.789
Yes, let a mighty wind blow

03:08.822 --> 03:10.791
through your
mouth hole, Robin.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.695
Wonderful first effort.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.830
Ah, well,
you're a great teacher.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.571
-Uh...

03:23.604 --> 03:25.306
A squeaky hinge probably?

03:32.680 --> 03:33.981
What is that noise?

03:34.014 --> 03:37.217
I don't know, man.
It's getting weird in here.

03:50.498 --> 03:51.965
I can't take this, bro!

03:51.999 --> 03:53.801
What can you not take,
friends?

03:53.834 --> 03:55.536
-Hey!

03:55.569 --> 03:57.705
That wasn't me.

04:00.308 --> 04:03.043
From where are these
humorous whistles originating?

04:03.076 --> 04:04.645
-It was I.

04:04.678 --> 04:07.481
Robin, you have
learned the whistle.

04:07.515 --> 04:09.249
Indeed, Starfire.

04:16.424 --> 04:18.992
-That's not whistling, brah...
-Sure it is.

04:19.026 --> 04:21.495
As I have done with
all of my shortcomings,

04:21.529 --> 04:23.664
I've adopted the use
of a gadget.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.667
Robin, whistling isn't
like flying

04:26.700 --> 04:27.901
or shooting lasers
out of your eyes

04:27.935 --> 04:29.703
or being super strong
or teleportation

04:29.737 --> 04:31.004
or invulnerability or flying

04:31.038 --> 04:32.540
or shooting lasers
out of your eyes

04:32.573 --> 04:34.074
or being super strong
or teleportation

04:34.107 --> 04:35.843
or invulnerability
or being super strong

04:35.876 --> 04:36.910
-or teleportation...
-I get it.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.546
I don't have super powers.

04:38.579 --> 04:39.813
That's right, you don't.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.549
I'm just saying that
whistling is a skill

04:41.582 --> 04:43.050
that everyone can master.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.919
Indeed. It is like learning
the new language.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.756
That's why we need
total immersion therapy.

04:51.392 --> 04:54.395
So, you guys are only going
to communicate

04:54.428 --> 04:55.763
through whistling from now on?

04:57.130 --> 04:59.467
And this is supposed to
make me learn faster?

05:00.934 --> 05:03.537
But how can you talk to
each other in whistles?

05:03.571 --> 05:04.572
No one does that.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.382
But how?

05:48.416 --> 05:49.650
Argh!

05:49.683 --> 05:51.685
It doesn't matter
if I can't whistle.

05:51.719 --> 05:54.021
Do I have to remind you the
H.I.V.E. is up to something?

05:54.054 --> 05:56.490
And who is going to
lead us against them?

05:56.524 --> 05:58.426
Me! I'm your leader.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.860
Brah, you can't even lead

05:59.893 --> 06:02.095
your lips into making some
sweet, sweet mouth music.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.998
Ahhh! It's true.
You guys have to help me.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.601
There is one last option.

06:15.843 --> 06:17.411
Please use your words.

06:17.445 --> 06:19.713
Travel to the mystical
mountains of Gomera,

06:19.747 --> 06:22.049
find the master of whistles.
Okay.

06:28.188 --> 06:30.491
Hello.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.864
-TEAPOT: Hello, there.

06:36.897 --> 06:40.000
Down here. What brings
you to our castle?

06:40.033 --> 06:42.636
I seek the master of whistles.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.204
Of course, of course.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.575
But first would you care
for some tea?

06:47.608 --> 06:48.942
I have to see the master.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.944
I don't have time to
speak with a little teapot.

06:50.978 --> 06:53.547
So all you see is a teapot

06:53.581 --> 06:57.050
vertically challenged
and sturdily constructed?

06:57.084 --> 06:59.920
Yeah, there is your handle
and you've got a spout.

06:59.953 --> 07:03.123
Arrogant boy, you are
getting me all steamed up.

07:06.226 --> 07:07.528
Master.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.932
If only I could
whistle like that.

07:11.965 --> 07:13.801
Of course you can.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.536
First, some refreshments.

07:18.238 --> 07:20.874
Ah, a little something to
wet my whistle, eh?

07:23.844 --> 07:27.214
What was that?
-Hot sauce, my dear boy.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.551
Why did you
make me drink hot...

07:35.856 --> 07:37.758
Your doubt has been unblocked.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.460
Now your training can begin.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.108
Your training is going well.

08:29.309 --> 08:30.310
It's the H.I.V.E.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.780
and they have taken
the other Titans hostage.

08:32.813 --> 08:33.981
I have to go.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.617
-But you're not ready.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.619
I said you're not ready.

08:41.221 --> 08:43.591
Never mind,
then, you're ready.

08:43.624 --> 08:44.858
Now go on.

08:44.892 --> 08:47.127
Save your friends.

08:47.160 --> 08:50.297
Our super-secret weapon
is finally complete.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.902
Say goodbye, Titans.

08:54.935 --> 08:58.038
ROBIN: What do we have here?

08:58.071 --> 09:00.774
Death laser.
So, that's what you are up to.

09:00.808 --> 09:02.610
Get him.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.591
She taught you her secrets.

09:26.199 --> 09:28.969
Oh, yeah.
Whistle while you work, kid.

09:39.379 --> 09:42.650
GIZMO:
I got you now, Robin.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.999
Use your steam, Robin.

10:11.244 --> 10:12.212
Robin,

10:12.245 --> 10:15.983
I never knew whistles
could be so powerful.

10:16.016 --> 10:19.386
Yes, they have the power
to destroy.

10:19.419 --> 10:20.788
Or enchant.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.127
Wow.

10:31.732 --> 10:34.167
So beautiful.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.738
Robin, kiss me.
