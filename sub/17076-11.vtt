WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:02.768
- Hey, stella.

00:02.769 --> 00:04.135
I put your name down
as my emergency contact

00:04.138 --> 00:05.137
<i> for the procedure.</i>

00:05.139 --> 00:07.406
- I take my duties
very seriously.

00:07.408 --> 00:09.341
<i> And when you come out,</i>
<i> I'll be waiting.</i>

00:09.343 --> 00:11.176
[both laughing]

00:12.213 --> 00:14.013
- andre.
- Me and louie--

00:14.015 --> 00:15.748
I haven't been able to stop
thinking about him.

00:15.750 --> 00:17.483
I want to fight for
full custody of my son.

00:17.485 --> 00:18.484
- Excuse me?

00:18.486 --> 00:20.119
<i> - I love him so much,</i>

00:20.121 --> 00:21.387
but this isn't about us.

00:21.389 --> 00:22.488
What kind of people
would we be

00:22.490 --> 00:25.057
<i> to deny louie all of this?</i>

00:37.238 --> 00:40.372
[distant crashing and banging]

00:49.817 --> 00:53.185
[objects clattering]

01:04.565 --> 01:07.399
- what are you doing, babe?

01:07.401 --> 01:09.835
- Nothing.
Packing.

01:09.837 --> 01:12.404
- It's 3:00 in the morning.

01:12.406 --> 01:13.539
- This is a guest room.

01:13.541 --> 01:15.541
It's going back to being
a guest room.

01:18.212 --> 01:20.412
- You know, louie's dad didn't--
didn't want that stuff.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.448
You gonna take it
to goodwill?

01:22.450 --> 01:25.150
- I said I'm boxing it.

01:25.152 --> 01:27.286
I didn't say I'm
getting rid of it.

01:35.196 --> 01:38.130
- Okay.

01:38.132 --> 01:39.498
I'm gonna go back to bed.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.339
[sighs]

01:47.341 --> 01:49.675
- [groans]

01:52.346 --> 01:54.646
- hey, kelly.
How's anna feeling?

01:54.648 --> 01:55.881
- Night and day.

01:55.883 --> 01:58.584
- Well, you got
high-octane bone marrow.

01:58.586 --> 02:00.652
How are you?
- Eh, little sore.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.588
- God, does he
ever stop whining?

02:02.590 --> 02:04.690
- Never.

02:08.696 --> 02:11.363
- Son of a bitch.

02:11.365 --> 02:12.431
We got a rat.

02:12.433 --> 02:13.899
- Seriously?

02:13.901 --> 02:16.702
- Yeah, he got in
the raisin bran.

02:16.704 --> 02:20.305
Got in the oatmeal.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.424
- What is it?

02:22.425 --> 02:24.542
- Rat got into the cabinets,
lieutenant.

02:24.545 --> 02:27.212
- Maybe if this place
wasn't such a dump...

02:29.450 --> 02:31.350
- I don't think--
- hoover duty in the kitchen

02:31.352 --> 02:32.551
and common room.

02:32.553 --> 02:35.220
Top to bottom--
every crack and crevice.

02:35.222 --> 02:36.421
Throw out all the outdated food

02:36.423 --> 02:37.789
and polish every surface.

02:40.361 --> 02:42.427
I'm not messing around.
On it.

02:42.429 --> 02:44.563
Now.

02:46.233 --> 02:48.667
[alarm blares]

02:48.669 --> 02:50.536
<i> - ambulance 61, person down.</i>

02:50.538 --> 02:52.538
<i> 300 north central park avenue.</i>

02:52.540 --> 02:54.773
- Garfield park?
- I think so.

02:58.179 --> 02:59.511
- It's a student
on a school trip.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.346
Says she can't get up.

03:01.348 --> 03:02.648
- Watch your back, guys.
Look out.

03:02.650 --> 03:05.517
- On the bus, darla said
her stomach hurt.

03:05.519 --> 03:06.919
We thought she was carsick.

03:06.921 --> 03:08.687
But when we got inside,
she buckled over.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.422
- [groans, gasps]

03:10.424 --> 03:11.557
- hi, darla, honey,
can you tell me

03:11.559 --> 03:12.558
where you feel the pain?

03:12.560 --> 03:15.294
- My back...
And my stomach.

03:15.296 --> 03:16.395
- I'm gabby, and this is sylvie.

03:16.397 --> 03:17.763
We're gonna take care
of you, okay?

03:17.765 --> 03:19.298
- Can you roll on
your back, sweetie?

03:19.300 --> 03:20.666
- [gasping]
it hurts so bad.

03:20.668 --> 03:22.467
[panting]

03:22.469 --> 03:24.570
- any tenderness?

03:24.572 --> 03:26.505
- It's on the inside.

03:30.945 --> 03:32.678
[groans]

03:32.680 --> 03:35.447
- uh, we're gonna need all
the students out of this area.

03:35.449 --> 03:37.216
- Okay.
All right, guys.

03:37.218 --> 03:38.450
Follow me--now.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.552
Trisha!

03:40.554 --> 03:42.487
- Darla.
- [panting]

03:42.489 --> 03:45.257
- you're having contractions.

03:45.259 --> 03:46.692
- What's that?

03:46.694 --> 03:48.627
[panting]

03:48.629 --> 03:51.763
- honey, do you know
you're pregnant?

03:52.967 --> 03:54.800
- What?
What?

04:00.674 --> 04:01.629
.

04:01.630 --> 04:02.585
- I can't be pregnant.

04:02.586 --> 04:03.541
- Can't's got nothing
to do with it.

04:03.544 --> 04:04.643
You are, honey.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.411
Brett, we got to transport her.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.479
- Yeah.

04:07.481 --> 04:08.480
Come on, sweetie.

04:08.482 --> 04:09.848
- [exhales] okay.

04:09.850 --> 04:10.983
Oh, no, no, no.

04:10.985 --> 04:12.551
No, no! Oh!

04:12.553 --> 04:13.552
Ugh!

04:13.554 --> 04:14.753
- What are you
feeling, darla?

04:14.755 --> 04:18.724
- It's--it's like pressure
down there.

04:18.726 --> 04:21.393
- Okay.
All right.

04:21.395 --> 04:22.661
Turn over on your back
for me, sweetheart.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.997
- [gasping]

04:28.902 --> 04:30.602
- this baby's on its way.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.572
- Oh, my god.
- I'll get the ob kit.

04:33.574 --> 04:34.606
- It's okay, honey.

04:34.608 --> 04:35.841
We're good at this,
I promise.

04:35.843 --> 04:36.942
Done it lots of times.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.611
- My dad's gonna kill me.

04:39.613 --> 04:40.813
- We're here for you.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.014
We'll talk you through
every step, all right?

04:42.016 --> 04:43.682
Now let's worry
about you, all right?

04:43.684 --> 04:45.517
- Okay.

04:47.021 --> 04:49.554
- All right.

04:49.556 --> 04:51.890
Give me one good push, okay?

04:51.892 --> 04:53.492
- [groaning]

04:53.494 --> 04:54.693
- okay, stop pushing.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.561
Baby's breech.

04:56.563 --> 04:58.463
- [panting]

04:58.465 --> 05:01.066
- I'm gonna reach in and try
and ease the baby's legs out.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.734
- Okay, tough girl,
let's do this.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.469
Get ready to push again, okay?

05:04.471 --> 05:05.804
- I'll try.
- Good.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.440
On three--one, two, three.

05:08.442 --> 05:09.574
- [screaming]

05:09.576 --> 05:13.712
[shrieking]

05:14.648 --> 05:16.481
why isn't it coming?

05:16.483 --> 05:17.849
- You're doing great.
Let's try again.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.851
Gentle push--
nice, easy breaths.

05:19.853 --> 05:20.919
- [grunting]

05:20.921 --> 05:21.987
- okay, the baby's shifting.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.755
This is our shot.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.857
- [screaming]
- got one leg.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.893
Two of 'em.

05:27.895 --> 05:29.728
- Got a little girl
on the way.

05:29.730 --> 05:30.829
Just keep it up.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.764
- [moans]

05:32.766 --> 05:35.767
- I've got her to her
shoulders, but...

05:35.769 --> 05:37.336
Gabby, the head isn't coming.

05:38.839 --> 05:39.971
- [whispering]
okay.

05:42.543 --> 05:44.226
You need to reach in
with your hand--

05:44.227 --> 05:45.910
create an airway for the baby
till the next contraction

05:45.913 --> 05:49.047
so she doesn't suffocate.
- Okay.

05:49.049 --> 05:50.749
- Girl, I know how
tired you are.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.551
But this is it, right here.

05:52.553 --> 05:53.785
Next contraction, I'm gonna
need you to push

05:53.787 --> 05:54.920
with all your strength, okay?

05:54.922 --> 05:56.121
- I can't. I can't.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.889
- Hey, you are strong.
I know it.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.691
- I ca...
- Okay, this it.

05:59.693 --> 06:00.726
- Here we go, darla, now!

06:00.728 --> 06:02.728
- [screaming]

06:02.730 --> 06:04.629
- come on, come on,
give me all you got!

06:04.631 --> 06:06.631
- Yes, yes, yes!

06:06.633 --> 06:08.667
- [screaming]
- all right, the head's out.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.035
- Okay, we got her.
We got her.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.771
- [wheezing]

06:12.773 --> 06:14.139
- [whispering]
thank you.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.843
- [crying]

06:25.052 --> 06:26.785
- come on.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.854
- Is she--is she okay?

06:32.693 --> 06:35.026
- [baby moaning]

06:35.028 --> 06:37.829
[crying]

06:37.831 --> 06:39.064
- see for yourself.

06:39.066 --> 06:42.401
- [baby wailing]

06:48.709 --> 06:50.041
- no way.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.879
- [chuckling]

06:55.682 --> 06:57.783
- hi.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.056
- I'm confused.

07:05.058 --> 07:06.691
Am I supposed to see my face

07:06.693 --> 07:08.960
in this kind of surface or not?

07:08.962 --> 07:11.096
- Just keep polishing.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.731
- Does anybody notice that mouch

07:12.733 --> 07:14.933
cleans things at eye level
and eye level only?

07:14.935 --> 07:17.869
- And that is why I have
perfect posture.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.704
- Hey, casey, we're
almost done here.

07:19.706 --> 07:21.273
- Come on, guys.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.841
Move the refrigerators;
pull out the stove.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.075
You know how this works.

07:24.077 --> 07:26.745
- Casey, that's
third shift's locker.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.748
- They've got a bunch of old
peanut butter cups

07:29.750 --> 07:30.916
that are attracting rodents.

07:30.918 --> 07:32.818
Get 'em out of here.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.770
Come on!

07:34.771 --> 07:36.721
Do it half-assed, you have
to do it a second time.

07:36.723 --> 07:38.056
Do it right, or do it again.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.858
- No, we're on it, lieutenant.

07:39.860 --> 07:40.859
- Good.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.727
- Hey, uh, lieutenant.

07:42.729 --> 07:45.163
Is there something you want
to get off your chest?

07:45.165 --> 07:47.499
- Yeah.

07:49.102 --> 07:51.102
Get to the hardware store
and buy every rat trap

07:51.104 --> 07:52.637
and poison they have.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.105
Or send otis.
I don't care.

07:54.107 --> 07:55.707
Just get it done.
- Sure.

07:55.709 --> 07:56.875
But if you want to talk, I'm--

07:56.877 --> 07:58.210
- I'm good.

08:01.715 --> 08:02.914
- The nurses will bring
the baby in

08:02.915 --> 08:04.114
after they do all
the standard exams.

08:04.117 --> 08:05.750
- Okay.

08:05.752 --> 08:07.018
- My god, darla.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.753
Are you okay?
Is she okay?

08:08.755 --> 08:10.088
- Daddy--
- uh, she's fine.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.223
She just had a bit of a scare.

08:11.225 --> 08:13.692
- What the hell's going on?
They s--

08:13.694 --> 08:15.760
they said you had a baby?

08:15.762 --> 08:17.162
- Yeah.
I didn't know.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.630
I thought I was sick.

08:18.632 --> 08:20.198
- How could you
let this happen?

08:20.200 --> 08:22.667
- I'm sorry.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.936
- Sir, your daughter's
really exhausted right now.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.171
- This is none of your business.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.006
- Okay, dawson,
we should go.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.074
- Look, I--I know
I messed up,

08:29.076 --> 08:31.176
but, daddy, you have
to see this baby.

08:31.178 --> 08:34.112
- You have no business
raising a child, darla.

08:34.114 --> 08:35.780
You can barely take
care of yourself!

08:35.782 --> 08:36.915
- Hey!

08:36.917 --> 08:38.250
Don't talk to
your daughter like that.

08:38.252 --> 08:39.568
She needs your support
right now,

08:39.569 --> 08:40.885
not your judgment.
- Do you have any idea

08:40.888 --> 08:41.987
what you're getting in
the middle of here?

08:41.989 --> 08:43.505
- Dawson.

08:43.506 --> 08:45.022
- Everyone always knows best
but me, right?

08:45.025 --> 08:46.825
You, your--your friends
at school,

08:46.827 --> 08:49.895
these people.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.130
You want to keep the baby?

08:52.132 --> 08:53.798
Then go live with
your aunt therese.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.233
- What?
No, dad--

08:55.235 --> 08:57.035
- mr. Thompson,
let's go for a walk.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.303
Calm down.
- No need.

08:58.305 --> 09:01.072
I'm leaving.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.108
Don't come crawling back to me

09:03.109 --> 09:05.143
when all the boys at school
move on to the next easy girl.

09:05.145 --> 09:07.846
You have humiliated me enough.

09:14.988 --> 09:18.323
- Hey...
He didn't mean that.

09:18.325 --> 09:20.325
He's just in shock is all.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.930
- Yeah.

09:31.038 --> 09:32.059
.

09:32.060 --> 09:33.081
- Ladies.
- What's up?

09:33.082 --> 09:34.103
- Fueling up the rig,
thought I'd swing by,

09:34.107 --> 09:35.607
check on a patient.

09:35.609 --> 09:36.608
You?

09:36.610 --> 09:38.343
- Uh, delivered
a surprise baby.

09:38.345 --> 09:41.212
The girl's father
didn't take it so well.

09:41.214 --> 09:42.948
- Oh.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.082
You okay?

09:44.084 --> 09:45.617
- Yeah, I'm fine.

09:45.619 --> 09:47.919
I'm a people person.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.600
- I know what
you're up to.

10:01.602 --> 10:03.268
You heard that I
was up and about,

10:03.270 --> 10:05.670
and you figured I'd be
wearing my hospital gown,

10:05.672 --> 10:09.174
open in the back,
and get a little peep show.

10:09.176 --> 10:11.876
- [laughing]
you figured it out.

10:11.878 --> 10:14.779
- Yeah, well,
too bad for you,

10:14.780 --> 10:17.681
this robe's from grandma turner,
and it stays firmly in place.

10:17.684 --> 10:20.318
- Does your nurse know that
you're wandering the halls?

10:20.320 --> 10:21.886
- Yeah, she made me.

10:21.888 --> 10:23.021
Says I have to be "ambulatory"

10:23.023 --> 10:25.056
in order to get me discharged.

10:29.162 --> 10:30.228
- When you out of here?

10:30.230 --> 10:32.397
- Mm, they're vague.

10:32.399 --> 10:35.166
Maybe at the end
of the week.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.702
I think they like to keep it
a bit of a mystery.

10:39.272 --> 10:42.007
- That soon?

10:42.009 --> 10:44.075
- Yeah.

10:44.077 --> 10:47.245
- Then what?

10:47.247 --> 10:49.681
- Home is calling.

10:52.052 --> 10:53.251
- That's great.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.387
- Yeah.

11:01.395 --> 11:03.028
- Could you pick up the pace?

11:03.030 --> 11:04.429
- [laughing]
shut up.

11:04.431 --> 11:06.297
- Slowpoke.

11:07.267 --> 11:08.900
- Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up--
get it off.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.669
- I'm trying if you'd
just stop moving.

11:11.438 --> 11:13.438
- Hm, couldn't resist
the cheese, huh?

11:13.440 --> 11:16.174
- You try setting that
medieval contraption.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.281
- Hey.
You okay?

11:24.451 --> 11:26.051
- Lousy call.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.386
- Not under the console,
herrmann!

11:28.388 --> 11:30.321
Put it behind
the trash can!

11:31.692 --> 11:33.425
What was the call?

11:33.427 --> 11:35.760
- Never mind.

11:37.064 --> 11:39.030
- Gabby...
- I got to get supplies.

12:00.787 --> 12:04.155
- Hey, doesn't truck
carry a rabbit tool?

12:04.157 --> 12:05.190
- Yep.

12:05.192 --> 12:06.725
- Then what the hell
are you doing

12:06.727 --> 12:08.960
using this stone age technique?

12:08.962 --> 12:10.495
- You're missing the point.

12:13.366 --> 12:15.300
- Okay.

12:15.302 --> 12:17.368
- Point is, if I'm not
over here drilling,

12:17.370 --> 12:20.038
then I think casey wants me
to clean the urinals.

12:20.040 --> 12:23.074
And I am avoiding that
at all costs.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.212
- Anna was asking about you.

12:28.482 --> 12:30.181
- Asking what?

12:30.183 --> 12:33.051
- I think she just wanted
to say thank you--

12:33.053 --> 12:36.221
you know, for being there
for me when I was laid up.

12:39.392 --> 12:41.760
- I mean, I did that
for you--

12:41.762 --> 12:43.495
not for her.

12:46.166 --> 12:48.266
- You need a hand with that?
- Nope.

12:48.268 --> 12:52.270
<i> - Truck 81, squad 3,</i>
<i> engine 51, ambulance 61.</i>

12:52.272 --> 12:55.373
<i> Structure fire,</i>
<i> 3281 west palmer.</i>

13:12.425 --> 13:14.125
- Is everybody out?

13:14.127 --> 13:15.293
- I own the building.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.561
- I said, is everybody out?

13:16.563 --> 13:19.097
- Well, nobody's seen
carly and her daughter.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.832
They live up in
the top front unit.

13:20.834 --> 13:23.268
- We may have victims
trapped upstairs.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.053
Let's do a primary search.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.837
51, let's get a hose line
in the first floor.

13:26.840 --> 13:27.839
Protect the stairway.

13:27.841 --> 13:30.241
Mouch, position the aerial.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.477
- Herrmann, otis, kidd--
let's go.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.813
- Copy that.
- Cruz, with me.

13:37.584 --> 13:41.186
- Fire department!
Call out!

13:41.188 --> 13:42.420
Kidd.
- Yeah?

13:42.422 --> 13:44.422
- Let's check the basement.
- Yep.

13:44.424 --> 13:45.590
- We'll take the top floor.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.826
- Hey, herrmann, otis,
take this floor.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.299
- Fire started
in the basement.

13:54.301 --> 13:57.202
We need a hose line
down here, chief.

13:57.204 --> 13:59.304
Over there, kidd.

13:59.306 --> 14:01.306
- Fire department!
- Fire department! Call out!

14:01.308 --> 14:02.907
- Help!

14:06.613 --> 14:08.913
Help me!

14:10.383 --> 14:11.516
Help!
Get me out of here!

14:11.518 --> 14:13.484
My leg is stuck!

14:13.486 --> 14:15.253
- Okay, hold on.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.889
- [grunting]

14:17.891 --> 14:20.225
[groaning] god!

14:20.227 --> 14:22.360
Argh!

14:22.362 --> 14:23.561
Hurry up!
- I can't!

14:23.563 --> 14:25.129
- Hurry!
- Hey, easy!

14:25.131 --> 14:26.130
Sir, easy!

14:26.132 --> 14:27.432
I need you to relax.

14:27.434 --> 14:29.267
Can you pull your leg out?

14:29.269 --> 14:30.368
- No, it's stuck!

14:30.370 --> 14:32.303
- Fire department!
Call out!

14:32.305 --> 14:34.439
- Help!
In here!

14:40.647 --> 14:42.180

14:42.182 --> 14:43.514

14:45.585 --> 14:46.651
- Don't you leave me here!

14:46.653 --> 14:48.653
- I'm not going anywhere.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.588
- Argh!
- Ready?

14:50.590 --> 14:51.623
Come on!
Pull!

14:51.625 --> 14:53.291
- Arrrrgh!

14:53.293 --> 14:55.393
[clattering]

14:58.431 --> 15:00.565
- I want everybody
out of that building.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.600
- [groaning]
<i> - emergency!</i>

15:02.602 --> 15:04.669
<i> Evacuate the building</i>
<i> immediately!</i>

15:04.671 --> 15:08.172
- Lieutenant, I need help!

15:08.174 --> 15:09.574
Casey!

15:09.576 --> 15:11.943
- [sputtering]

15:11.945 --> 15:14.646
hey! Hey!

15:16.249 --> 15:17.649
You get me out of here.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.457
- Come on, I need
everybody out of there.

15:28.561 --> 15:31.229
- Kidd!

15:31.231 --> 15:34.399
- Lieutenant, I can't
get 'em both!

15:34.401 --> 15:36.968

15:38.571 --> 15:39.671
<i> - all units, report.</i>

15:39.673 --> 15:40.672

15:40.674 --> 15:43.374
I will kill you!

15:43.376 --> 15:45.410
- Help! Help her!
- [coughing]

15:45.412 --> 15:47.378
- I'll come back for you.
- No!

15:47.380 --> 15:50.381
No! Noooo!

15:50.383 --> 15:53.518
- [coughing]

16:02.362 --> 16:05.663
- got her?

16:05.665 --> 16:07.699
I got one more inside.
His leg's pinned.

16:07.701 --> 16:09.233
I just need someone
to help me.

16:09.235 --> 16:10.635
- You see the color
of that smoke?

16:10.637 --> 16:11.970
- I know I have time, chief.

16:11.972 --> 16:13.638
- I'll go with him.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.473
- Okay, one minute.
Not a second longer.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.642
- Let's go.

16:24.751 --> 16:27.585
Hey--stay back till
I tell you it's safe.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.487
- What are you talking about?

16:29.489 --> 16:32.223
- He's got a gun.

16:32.225 --> 16:33.057
Fire department!

16:33.059 --> 16:35.727
[crashing]

16:35.729 --> 16:37.762
- casey!

16:37.764 --> 16:39.564
[indistinct shouting]

16:56.716 --> 16:57.732
.

16:57.733 --> 16:58.749
- [coughs]

16:58.752 --> 17:00.551
- thanks.

17:02.555 --> 17:05.356
- You okay, lieutenant?

17:05.358 --> 17:07.125
- Should've been able
to get him out.

17:08.762 --> 17:11.095
- Did all you could.

17:11.097 --> 17:14.465
- And plus, you know,
you saved a little girl.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.474
- Fire's knocked down.

17:23.476 --> 17:26.077
It's safe to go back in.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.612
Hey.

17:27.614 --> 17:30.815
A guy you're trying to rescue
points a gun at you--

17:30.817 --> 17:33.818
you tell me right away.

17:33.820 --> 17:36.487
- You wouldn't let me
go back in, chief.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.790
- You're damn right I wouldn't.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.493
- Guys, let's go get him.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.629
Herrmann, grab a body bag.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.585
Severide.
Give me a hand.

18:24.170 --> 18:26.804
The hell?

18:26.806 --> 18:28.673
- It's got to be
the wrong spot, huh?

18:28.675 --> 18:30.808
- Nope.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.610
This is where he was.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.654
- Hey.

18:46.593 --> 18:49.694
- Lieutenant, you sure you're
looking in the right place?

18:49.696 --> 18:51.195
- I'm sure.

18:51.197 --> 18:52.730
- It's just with all
the smoke, sometimes--

18:52.732 --> 18:54.665
- this is the right place, otis!

18:56.469 --> 18:58.669
I left him right here.
- Casey.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.707
Take truck 81 home.

19:02.709 --> 19:03.774
- Not until I find him, chief.

19:03.776 --> 19:07.211
- 51 will finish the overhaul.

19:07.213 --> 19:09.147
- Squad'll stay too.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.251
Go ahead.

19:28.168 --> 19:30.268
- 81, pack it up.
- Copy.

19:38.178 --> 19:41.913
- Seriously, mouch?
A charleston chew?

19:41.915 --> 19:44.282
- Any left?

19:50.823 --> 19:52.323
- So we went through
the wreckage,

19:52.325 --> 19:54.759
splinter by splinter--no body.

19:54.761 --> 19:56.794
We turned the scene over to ofi.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.763
They'll bring in search dogs,

19:58.765 --> 20:01.566
look for any traces of him--

20:01.568 --> 20:04.569
if you're saying there's
still someone inside.

20:04.571 --> 20:05.903
- Well, I wasn't hallucinating,

20:05.905 --> 20:07.638
so yeah.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.740
That's what I'm saying.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.357
- Lieutenant?

20:26.359 --> 20:28.259
- Yeah.

20:28.261 --> 20:32.263
- Um, we got about 15 minutes
left on, uh, shift.

20:32.265 --> 20:34.632
And we couldn't catch that rat,

20:34.634 --> 20:37.868
but the place has never looked
more spic-and-span.

20:37.870 --> 20:39.604
So, ah...

20:39.606 --> 20:41.706
We're gonna wind it down.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.841
- Good.

20:45.812 --> 20:49.614
- You want to go get some
breakfast and talk?

20:49.616 --> 20:51.649
I know losing louie
wasn't what--

20:51.651 --> 20:53.784
- I don't.

20:57.357 --> 20:59.657
- Eh.

21:16.909 --> 21:18.409
- Stella.

21:18.411 --> 21:20.978
- Wow.
You look amazing.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.713
- Oh, you are--

21:22.715 --> 21:25.349
you are a terrible,
terrible liar.

21:25.351 --> 21:27.918
It's gonna take a lot more
bacon cheeseburgers

21:27.920 --> 21:29.954
before I'm back to
my fighting weight.

21:29.956 --> 21:32.657
But they are gonna
let me out of here soon.

21:32.659 --> 21:34.325
- Good.

21:34.327 --> 21:37.928
- Um, I'm really
glad you came by.

21:37.930 --> 21:40.831
I wanted to thank you
for helping kelly

21:40.833 --> 21:43.367
throughout all
that madness.

21:43.369 --> 21:44.635
He said you were
really there for him.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.437
- Yeah, you know, he, uh...

21:46.439 --> 21:48.005
He's kind of helpless, so...

21:48.007 --> 21:50.741
I just...

21:50.743 --> 21:53.744
Figured he could
use some backup.

21:53.746 --> 21:56.314
- Can I ask you something?

21:56.316 --> 21:58.983
Are you and him--
are you guys together?

22:01.087 --> 22:04.021
- Uh, no.

22:04.023 --> 22:07.358
No, we're not.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.960
- Anna, we need to...

22:09.962 --> 22:11.762
- Yeah, yes.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.403
- I'll...

22:19.405 --> 22:20.971
I'll get out of your hair.

22:20.973 --> 22:22.873
- Thanks for stopping by--

22:22.875 --> 22:25.476
and for everything.

22:25.478 --> 22:26.811
- Yeah.

22:29.415 --> 22:31.782
- When we went to the spot
on overhaul,

22:31.784 --> 22:32.850
no body--

22:32.852 --> 22:34.418
nowhere.

22:34.420 --> 22:37.121
And this is in
the basement, gabby.

22:37.123 --> 22:40.358
So where'd he go?

22:40.360 --> 22:42.993
- Maybe things shifted
when the roof came down

22:42.995 --> 22:44.762
and took the pressure
off his leg.

22:44.764 --> 22:45.863
I mean, you know
as well as I do,

22:45.865 --> 22:47.815
weird things happen in fires.

22:47.816 --> 22:49.766
- And then what, he just
walked out the front door

22:49.769 --> 22:52.069
and no one saw him?

22:52.071 --> 22:53.971
- I don't know.

22:55.908 --> 22:58.109
Guess you just got
to chalk it up

22:58.111 --> 23:00.444
to one of those things.

23:03.516 --> 23:05.916
- I just...

23:06.919 --> 23:09.053
Just feel like I'm
losing my mind.

23:17.430 --> 23:18.996
- I'm gonna run out for a bit.

24:04.744 --> 24:07.745
- Dawson, this is therese,
darla's aunt.

24:07.747 --> 24:08.979
- Oh, cool.

24:08.981 --> 24:10.581
I was just about to check in
on your niece.

24:10.583 --> 24:12.883
- This is the medic darla
was telling you about.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.923
- I heard about how you
talked to her father.

24:21.160 --> 24:24.528
- Yeah, well, he wasn't being
very supportive.

24:24.530 --> 24:26.230
- Charles raised
that girl himself.

24:26.232 --> 24:28.098
Did you know that?

24:28.100 --> 24:31.135
His wife walked out on them
when darla was just a baby--

24:31.137 --> 24:33.471
moved to miami,
never came back.

24:33.473 --> 24:37.808
That man has put up with more
than you will ever know.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.543
He's blaming himself
for all this,

24:39.545 --> 24:42.112
but he did the best
he could for her.

24:42.114 --> 24:45.516
Took a demotion so he could be
home when she got out of school.

24:45.518 --> 24:49.587
Coached every soccer team,
showed up for every school play.

24:51.524 --> 24:55.226
So maybe before you judge him
for not being supportive...

24:56.896 --> 24:59.897
Maybe you should try to see
this shock through his eyes.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.501
- I...

25:06.239 --> 25:08.205
You're right.

25:08.207 --> 25:11.008
- I'll let darla know
you stopped by.

25:21.254 --> 25:22.712
.

25:22.713 --> 25:24.171
- Ofi has closed
their investigation

25:24.172 --> 25:25.630
of the west palmer fire.

25:25.631 --> 25:27.089
No human remains were
found anywhere inside.

25:29.161 --> 25:30.594
- Okay.

25:30.596 --> 25:32.663
- But there was this:

25:32.665 --> 25:33.998
"a small hatch was discovered

25:34.000 --> 25:35.266
"in the basement leading
to the alley

25:35.268 --> 25:36.934
"on the west side
of the structure.

25:36.936 --> 25:39.270
"it is possible that
the unaccounted for victim

25:39.272 --> 25:41.972
escaped the fire
through this hatch."

25:41.974 --> 25:43.941
- did they figure out
who the guy is?

25:43.943 --> 25:47.011
- No identifying items
survived the fire.

25:47.013 --> 25:49.613
Building residents didn't know
anyone fitting his description--

25:49.615 --> 25:51.582
didn't know anyone living in
the basement at all,

25:51.584 --> 25:52.683
for that matter.

25:52.685 --> 25:54.184
- Weren't there some
guns left behind?

25:54.186 --> 25:57.054
- Atf trace led to
a private dealer.

25:57.056 --> 25:59.557
No paper trail.
That's not unusual.

26:01.661 --> 26:05.195
- He would've been burned,
chief--severely.

26:05.197 --> 26:07.097
Why didn't he come
to the medics for help?

26:07.099 --> 26:08.566
- Casey.

26:08.568 --> 26:10.267
The man pulled a gun on you.

26:10.269 --> 26:11.969
He was squatting
in the basement.

26:11.971 --> 26:14.305
You are trying to attach
rational behavior to this man.

26:14.307 --> 26:17.107
You aren't gonna find any.

26:17.109 --> 26:20.077
Point is, he's alive.

26:20.079 --> 26:22.246
You don't have to worry
about him anymore.

26:27.253 --> 26:29.086
- Thanks, chief.

26:29.088 --> 26:31.221
- You're welcome.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.662
- I know you want
the apparatus floor cleaned,

26:38.664 --> 26:40.197
and we're all over it.

26:40.199 --> 26:42.366
- Tell 81 we're
going for a ride.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.352
Excuse me.

27:01.354 --> 27:03.687
Rick denton?
- Hi, there.

27:03.689 --> 27:05.289
You looking for an apartment?

27:05.291 --> 27:07.224
- No.
My name's matt casey.

27:07.226 --> 27:09.059
I'm a lieutenant with the cfd.

27:09.061 --> 27:10.344
- Oh, I see.

27:10.345 --> 27:11.628
- I wanted to ask you
about the man

27:11.631 --> 27:14.632
living in the basement
at 3281 west palmer.

27:16.702 --> 27:19.370
- There's no basement unit
in that building.

27:19.372 --> 27:21.705
I know there was a report
of a victim being trapped

27:21.707 --> 27:25.175
down there, but, uh,
I can tell you,

27:25.177 --> 27:27.244
there's nobody living
in that basement.

27:27.246 --> 27:29.346
- Well, I saw him.

27:29.348 --> 27:32.016
Now, I'm not trying
to get you in trouble.

27:32.018 --> 27:33.751
If you were renting to him
under the table--

27:33.753 --> 27:36.320
- what? Wait, are you
accusing me of, uh--

27:36.322 --> 27:39.223
- I'm just trying to find out
who he is.

27:41.360 --> 27:45.195
Mr. Denton, I want to find this
man and make sure he's okay.

27:45.197 --> 27:46.797
I feel responsible.

27:46.799 --> 27:50.034
I had to choose between him
and a little girl.

27:50.036 --> 27:52.436
As a firefighter--
- I don't know who he is.

27:52.438 --> 27:56.173
If he was squatting,
no one told me.

27:56.175 --> 27:57.658
All right?

27:57.659 --> 27:59.142
And that's the last thing
I'm gonna tell you

27:59.145 --> 28:02.146
or the cops or anyone else
who comes by.

28:02.148 --> 28:06.116
Now if you'd excuse me,
I have some work to do.

28:39.185 --> 28:41.785
- Mr. Thompson.

28:41.787 --> 28:43.187
I just need five minutes
of your time.

28:43.189 --> 28:45.889
I'm sorry to bother you.

28:45.891 --> 28:48.158
Please.

28:55.468 --> 28:58.469
I apologize for the way I talked
to you at the hospital.

29:00.773 --> 29:04.174
- [exhales] I did everything
I could for that girl, and...

29:06.879 --> 29:09.213
I don't know where I blew it.

29:09.215 --> 29:11.148
- Kids do stupid things,
mr. Thompson,

29:11.150 --> 29:12.449
no matter how they're raised.

29:12.451 --> 29:14.485
I see it every day.

29:16.388 --> 29:20.824
But whatever happened
or whoever messed up,

29:20.826 --> 29:22.526
you're still her father...

29:25.498 --> 29:28.499
The person she loves
and respects the most.

29:33.405 --> 29:35.205
- Honestly, I, um--

29:35.207 --> 29:38.509
[clears throat]

29:38.511 --> 29:41.345
[exhales]
I don't know what to do.

29:45.351 --> 29:46.817
- Listen...

29:50.489 --> 29:53.257
I'm lucky enough
to know how it feels

29:53.259 --> 29:55.526
to hug my own child and tell him

29:55.528 --> 29:57.828
that everything's
gonna be okay.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.933
And how I remember it...

30:06.906 --> 30:09.373
It's the best feeling
in the world.

30:14.213 --> 30:16.814
So do that for your daughter,

30:16.816 --> 30:19.550
for your granddaughter,
for yourself.

30:20.586 --> 30:23.253
Because these moments...

30:24.523 --> 30:26.490
You don't get a whole lot
of time before they're over,

30:26.492 --> 30:28.826
you know?

30:47.913 --> 30:49.613
[taps door]

30:49.615 --> 30:51.599
- hey.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.584
I thought I wasn't gonna see you
till after your shift.

30:53.586 --> 30:55.252
- I know.

30:55.254 --> 30:56.987
- What, are you, like,
afraid I was gonna leave

30:56.989 --> 30:59.590
without saying
goodbye or something?

30:59.592 --> 31:01.258
- No.

31:01.260 --> 31:03.026
- What's going on?

31:03.028 --> 31:05.429
- Don't go back to springfield.

31:09.301 --> 31:11.602
- Why not?

31:11.604 --> 31:14.037
- Come on, you feel it too.

31:18.477 --> 31:20.544
There's something here.

31:23.649 --> 31:25.582
Stay in town a while.

31:25.584 --> 31:27.951
There's great doctors here.

31:27.953 --> 31:29.553
I'm here.

31:29.555 --> 31:32.356
Let's figure it out.

31:32.358 --> 31:33.858
- You know, you've only
known me as, like,

31:33.859 --> 31:35.359
this sick girl laying
in a hospital bed.

31:35.361 --> 31:37.461
That's not me.

31:37.463 --> 31:39.429
This...

31:39.431 --> 31:40.964
Is me.

31:40.966 --> 31:43.033
- I know.

31:43.035 --> 31:45.035
That's who I always saw there.

31:50.976 --> 31:53.076
<i> - Squad 3, can you take</i>
<i> a medical assist</i>

31:53.078 --> 31:56.647
<i> at 2175 west 18th street?</i>

31:56.649 --> 31:58.982
- Yeah, uh, copy that, main.

31:58.984 --> 32:01.285
- They're gonna discharge me
at 10:00 a.M.

32:01.287 --> 32:03.420
- I'll be here.

32:33.419 --> 32:34.685
What's the story, guys?

32:34.687 --> 32:36.553
- Guy called 911
from this address.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.355
Says he cut his leg with a saw.

32:38.357 --> 32:41.058
But nobody's answering,
and we can't get inside.

32:41.060 --> 32:42.693
- Hey, capp, why don't you
check the back there

32:42.695 --> 32:44.061
and see if there's
another way in?

32:44.063 --> 32:45.662
- Copy that.

32:50.336 --> 32:52.035
- Cruz, see if you
can peek inside.

32:52.037 --> 32:54.137
- Tony, give me a hand.

33:03.615 --> 33:05.549
Hey, grab an end.

33:30.509 --> 33:31.608
Guy bleeding.

33:31.610 --> 33:33.043
Got to get in there now.

33:37.082 --> 33:38.407
.

33:38.408 --> 33:39.733
<i> - All right, cruz, tony,</i>
<i> get back here.</i>

33:39.734 --> 33:41.059
Hey, capp, what do you
got back there?

33:41.060 --> 33:42.385
<i> - Steel door back here,</i>
<i> locked tight.</i>

33:42.388 --> 33:43.653
- All right, come up
around front.

33:43.655 --> 33:46.656
Tony, grab the rabbit tool.

33:46.658 --> 33:48.458
- Looks like he severed
his femoral artery.

33:48.460 --> 33:50.027
We might be too late.

33:50.029 --> 33:52.162
- Hey, you get us in there,
we'll be able to help him.

34:09.148 --> 34:11.815
- Ah, it should've
popped by now.

34:11.817 --> 34:14.051
There's probably a surface bolt
on the inside.

34:14.753 --> 34:16.253
Damn it!

34:16.255 --> 34:17.621
- Tony, you get another hose.

34:17.623 --> 34:19.823
- I'll steal one from the jaws.

34:19.825 --> 34:21.458
- Hey, we don't have time.

34:21.460 --> 34:22.793
Grab me that halligan.

34:28.834 --> 34:30.200
Tony.

34:33.705 --> 34:35.839
All right, give me a hand, guys.

34:35.841 --> 34:37.574
Ready? Go!

34:37.576 --> 34:39.576
[all groaning]

34:47.086 --> 34:49.686
- all right, one, two, three.

34:56.528 --> 34:58.662
[whispering]
come on, come on.

35:00.632 --> 35:02.766
I got a pulse!

35:20.686 --> 35:24.221
- Stone age technique
saves the day.

35:24.223 --> 35:25.906
- Yeah?

35:25.907 --> 35:27.590
- I had to marry halligans
to pop a door.

35:27.593 --> 35:29.493
- While I wasn't
there to mock you.

35:29.495 --> 35:30.627
Such a shame.

35:30.629 --> 35:33.697
- Timing's everything.
- Yeah, it is.

35:37.669 --> 35:41.238
- Hey, did I ever thank you?

35:41.240 --> 35:43.206
For being there for me
when I was laid up?

35:44.643 --> 35:46.910
- Yeah, you did.

35:46.912 --> 35:48.812
I mean, you had a concussion,

35:48.813 --> 35:50.713
so I just assumed that
you were delirious.

35:50.716 --> 35:52.916
But...Yeah.

35:57.923 --> 36:00.757
- So casey's still making you
spit polish the place, huh?

36:00.759 --> 36:02.526
- Non-stop.

36:02.528 --> 36:04.294
- Ugh.

36:04.296 --> 36:07.531
Well, if you guys want some
extra practice after shift,

36:07.533 --> 36:10.934
I got a few closets that
you can go over at home.

36:10.936 --> 36:12.802
- Ha ha.

36:12.804 --> 36:15.939
- [sighs]
you know what?

36:15.941 --> 36:18.275
Enough is enough.

36:24.683 --> 36:27.817
- Okay, thanks for checking.

36:27.819 --> 36:29.920
I'm calling hospitals
and urgent care facilities

36:29.922 --> 36:31.888
to see if they had any
walk-in burn patients

36:31.890 --> 36:33.323
in the last few days.

36:33.325 --> 36:35.292
So far, no luck.

36:35.294 --> 36:37.661
- All right, lieutenant, if you
don't mind my saying--

36:37.663 --> 36:39.296
- I do mind, herrmann.

36:39.298 --> 36:41.698
- Uh, no, you're gonna
shut up and listen.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.400
Pardon my french.

36:45.604 --> 36:46.903
- Everything okay here?

36:48.574 --> 36:51.908
- Yeah, herrmann was
just about to tell me

36:51.910 --> 36:53.944
what's bothering him about me.

36:56.215 --> 36:58.348
- You know what?

36:58.350 --> 37:00.067
You both need to listen,

37:00.068 --> 37:01.785
what with all these bees
in your bonnet, all right?

37:01.787 --> 37:04.621
That young girl's situation
with the baby,

37:04.623 --> 37:05.989
you know, you cleaning house,

37:05.991 --> 37:09.693
and looking for this john doe--

37:09.695 --> 37:11.861
something bad happens,

37:11.863 --> 37:14.931
and we try to exert control.

37:14.933 --> 37:18.835
But sometimes, it is better

37:18.837 --> 37:21.705
to live with the pain
for a little while.

37:22.908 --> 37:25.008
Process it, you know?

37:30.816 --> 37:32.983
Losing louie was a real blow.

37:34.920 --> 37:38.421
There is no harm in admitting
that to yourselves.

37:46.031 --> 37:47.797
I'm gonna leave you two to it.

37:47.799 --> 37:49.933
- Herrmann...

37:53.438 --> 37:56.339
Tell the guys to put
the supplies away

37:56.341 --> 37:58.942
and order some barbecue--

37:58.944 --> 38:01.278
on me.
- Yeah.

38:42.020 --> 38:43.920
- Oh! Gabby!

38:43.922 --> 38:45.088
- Hey.

38:47.025 --> 38:48.325
We, uh, just--

38:48.327 --> 38:49.693
we just wanted to drop off
some things

38:49.695 --> 38:51.361
we thought the baby
might be able to use.

38:51.363 --> 38:53.763
- Oh, wow, thank you.

38:53.765 --> 38:55.365
- Oh, sorry, this
is my husband, matt.

38:55.367 --> 38:56.800
- Matt.

38:56.802 --> 38:59.035
The boy who had these
loved them.

38:59.037 --> 39:00.503
I'm sure your daughter will too.

39:00.505 --> 39:03.340
- Um, gabby,

39:03.342 --> 39:05.475
that's what I named her.

39:06.445 --> 39:08.578
Gabby.

39:12.517 --> 39:14.984
- Can I--can I hold her?

39:14.986 --> 39:16.453
- Oh...

39:16.455 --> 39:17.987
- Absolutely.

39:17.989 --> 39:19.556
Come in, come in.

39:31.737 --> 39:34.003
- Hey, sorry,
I'm looking for anna.

39:34.005 --> 39:36.039
- Uh, discharged about
a half hour ago.

39:38.477 --> 39:40.143
She left that.

39:40.145 --> 39:41.611
Maybe you can
get it to her.
