Mm, yep.

02:31.488 --> 02:34.158
Almost.

02:35.426 --> 02:36.798
Jesus, Alex.

02:40.798 --> 02:41.798
Hello?

02:42.699 --> 02:47.036
Yes, this is him,
but I'm at work.

02:57.947 --> 03:00.450
Used to have a freshman
roommate named Ben, but

03:00.451 --> 03:03.790
that asswad hasn't
called me in ages.

03:06.790 --> 03:09.725
What?

03:09.726 --> 03:10.792
And no one was there?

03:10.793 --> 03:11.861
He was...

03:11.862 --> 03:14.196
Alone?

03:14.197 --> 03:15.565
Yeah, of course he was alone.

03:15.566 --> 03:17.533
That was stupid.

03:17.534 --> 03:20.503
Yeah, I can probably
get up in a couple hours. I just

03:20.504 --> 03:24.046
need a little bit of time
to get out of here.

03:28.730 --> 03:30.046
Well, he's gonna be okay.

03:30.047 --> 03:32.449
That's the most important thing.

03:33.049 --> 03:34.550
Okay.

03:34.551 --> 03:34.818
I gotta take this.

03:35.018 --> 03:36.586
Hang on a sec.

03:36.587 --> 03:38.588
Babe?

03:38.589 --> 03:39.689
Yeah, I'm fine.

03:39.690 --> 03:41.690

04:06.048 --> 04:07.783
Said it might be tonight.

04:07.784 --> 04:08.917
Might be in the morning.

04:08.918 --> 04:09.652
Do we call them?

04:09.653 --> 04:11.587
Because I feel like if we...

04:11.588 --> 04:12.955
I called them already.

04:12.956 --> 04:14.923
There's nothing else we can do.

04:14.924 --> 04:16.091
Yeah.

04:16.093 --> 04:18.233
Just keep straight.

04:23.233 --> 04:23.800
Babe?

04:24.000 --> 04:26.836
Mm?

04:26.837 --> 04:28.741
I got the fellowship.

04:31.875 --> 04:32.944
Wow.

04:33.944 --> 04:34.776
Wow.

04:34.777 --> 04:36.545
Yeah, I know.

04:36.546 --> 04:38.280
When were you going to tell me?

04:38.281 --> 04:38.961
What do you mean?

04:39.116 --> 04:40.249
I'm telling you now.

04:40.250 --> 04:42.285
Yeah, h-how long
have you known?

04:42.286 --> 04:44.287
I found out yesterday.

04:44.288 --> 04:46.989
Yeah, I mean, it's, it's
great for you, right?

04:46.990 --> 04:48.658
It's a great opportunity.

04:48.659 --> 04:49.659
- Yeah
- Yeah.

04:50.226 --> 04:51.761
It is, but...

04:51.762 --> 04:55.263
And then about us
moving out there.

04:55.264 --> 04:58.000
I think we've had this
conversation like fifty times.

04:58.200 --> 05:01.671
I can't just quit my
job and move to LA.

05:54.991 --> 05:58.360
Sarah's train should
be getting in.

05:58.361 --> 06:00.028
Okay.

06:00.029 --> 06:01.901
I'm gonna stay here.

06:04.901 --> 06:06.735
Josh!

06:06.736 --> 06:07.369
Hey.

06:07.370 --> 06:11.073
Hey, Sarah, uh, hi.

06:11.074 --> 06:14.843
Hi.

06:14.844 --> 06:15.684
It's good to see you.

06:15.685 --> 06:18.247
Oh, yeah, it's good
to see you too.

06:18.248 --> 06:20.650
Have you talked to Alex?

06:20.651 --> 06:23.352
No, but I can't wait to
ask that fucker what the

06:23.353 --> 06:25.720
hell he was thinking.

06:25.721 --> 06:28.090
Um, you're not actually
going to say that to him,

06:28.091 --> 06:29.124
- are you?
- Why not?

06:29.125 --> 06:31.005
Because he's fragile and
that's not appropriate.

06:31.006 --> 06:31.728
How do you know?

06:31.729 --> 06:33.865
When was the last time
you talked to him?

06:34.865 --> 06:36.131
That's what I thought.

06:36.132 --> 06:37.332
What do you want to do, Sarah?

06:37.333 --> 06:39.100
You wanna just tiptoe
around the whole thing?

06:39.101 --> 06:41.369
Pretend like nothing happened?

06:41.370 --> 06:44.006
No, no, I think we should...

06:44.007 --> 06:45.975
I think we should make
him feel safe and...

06:45.976 --> 06:47.009
Oh, okay.

06:47.010 --> 06:48.076
Loved, and...

06:48.077 --> 06:49.278
Yeah, and I think he's
going to think that that's

06:49.279 --> 06:52.014
bullshit, and I think he's
going to see right through it.

06:52.015 --> 06:52.747
<i>Sarah!</i>

06:52.748 --> 06:53.449
What?

06:53.450 --> 06:54.283
<i>Josh!</i>

06:54.284 --> 06:54.817
Hey.

06:55.017 --> 06:56.255
Hi!

06:58.255 --> 06:59.355
And you!

06:59.356 --> 07:01.790
We didn't even know
whether to expect you or not.

07:01.791 --> 07:03.091
No, well...

07:03.092 --> 07:04.326
Where's Isaac?

07:04.327 --> 07:06.028
Is he up here yet with
the new lady friend?

07:06.029 --> 07:07.129
Is that happening?

07:07.130 --> 07:08.097
With the who?

07:08.098 --> 07:09.198
Isaac's bringing someone?

07:09.199 --> 07:09.999
Yeah.

07:10.000 --> 07:10.800
His girlfriend.

07:10.801 --> 07:12.167
I didn't know he
was seeing anyone.

07:12.168 --> 07:12.934
It's recent.

07:12.935 --> 07:13.968
It's recent.

07:13.969 --> 07:14.903
She's 22.

07:14.904 --> 07:15.838
No she's not.

07:15.839 --> 07:16.771
Mhmm.

07:16.772 --> 07:18.107
Is she?

07:18.108 --> 07:18.674
What's wrong?

07:18.675 --> 07:19.595
It's not like she's 11.

07:19.596 --> 07:20.542
Calm down.

07:20.543 --> 07:22.583
Okay, first of all, you're
disgusting, and second of

07:22.584 --> 07:25.448
all, um, why does Isaac
think it's appropriate to

07:25.449 --> 07:26.449
bring a date to...

07:26.450 --> 07:27.484
How is it inappropriate?

07:27.485 --> 07:28.718
I was this close to
bringing, I was this close

07:28.719 --> 07:30.959
to bringing a date, and she
canceled at the last minute.

07:30.960 --> 07:31.960
She had a thing.

07:36.358 --> 07:36.959
Hi.

07:37.159 --> 07:39.261
It's okay that
I'm coming, right.

07:39.262 --> 07:40.261
Yeah, of course it's okay.

07:40.262 --> 07:41.329
You said you wanted to
come, I said it's fine.

07:41.330 --> 07:42.130
Of course it's fine.

07:42.231 --> 07:43.331
Wait, what?

07:43.332 --> 07:44.652
No, I didn't say
I wanted to come.

07:44.653 --> 07:46.493
I said that I wanted to
be there for you if you

07:46.494 --> 07:47.737
wanted me to be there.

07:47.738 --> 07:49.658
Why would I tell you to
come if I didn't want you

07:49.659 --> 07:50.159
to come.

07:50.207 --> 07:52.006
I am so sorry, but we're
out of premium-class

07:52.007 --> 07:53.242
vehicles.

07:53.243 --> 07:54.443
Could we interest you in one
of our more affordable models?

07:54.444 --> 07:55.404
Yeah, yeah. That's fine.

07:55.405 --> 07:56.879
Anything with
wheels is fine. Thanks.

07:56.880 --> 07:59.314
I shouldn't be here.

07:59.315 --> 08:01.252
Babe...

08:02.252 --> 08:04.887
I.. I wouldn't have
said you should come...

08:41.457 --> 08:44.025
<i>I'm just saying it's
an objective truth.</i>

08:44.027 --> 08:46.896
Japanese are the most
wacked-out people on earth.

08:46.897 --> 08:48.830
Oh my God, you're like
an 8 year-old racist.

08:48.831 --> 08:49.899
An 8 year-old racist...

08:49.900 --> 08:51.860
Look, you cram that many
people on an island, it's

08:51.861 --> 08:54.502
like a throbbing inbred
hothouse of cultural miasma.

08:54.503 --> 09:00.342
Frankly, I'm surprised
they don't have more fetishes.

09:00.343 --> 09:01.877
Oh shit.

09:01.878 --> 09:03.279
Ben Ben!

09:03.280 --> 09:04.512
You came.

09:04.513 --> 09:09.117
Against my better
fucking judgment, I came.

09:09.118 --> 09:10.118
Get the fuck over here.

09:10.119 --> 09:11.522
How you doing?

09:13.522 --> 09:15.491
Ben, get my back here please.

09:15.492 --> 09:17.292
We're not just going to
pretend with Alex like

09:17.293 --> 09:18.861
nothing happened here, right?

09:18.862 --> 09:20.094
What are you going to say?

09:20.095 --> 09:20.996
"Hey Alex.

09:20.997 --> 09:22.832
Interesting choice
to commit suicide."

09:22.833 --> 09:24.567
Thank you, Ben.

09:24.568 --> 09:25.601
Excuse me.

09:25.602 --> 09:27.035
- Hi!
- Oh my God...

09:27.036 --> 09:28.876
I can't believe that you
have her side on this.

09:28.877 --> 09:30.171
Hey, hey, hey.

09:30.172 --> 09:31.372
There are no sides.

09:31.373 --> 09:34.008
Let's just let
this be about Alex.

09:34.009 --> 09:35.109
Right?

09:35.110 --> 09:38.012
And speaking of which, I
think we should watch him.

09:38.013 --> 09:40.082
What?

09:40.083 --> 09:42.284
What, do you want to
set up like a monitoring system?

09:42.285 --> 09:45.487
Yeah. Kind of, but it'd be
casual.

09:45.488 --> 09:48.189
You know, tag in, tag out,
have somebody with him at

09:48.190 --> 09:49.290
all times.

09:49.291 --> 09:50.526
How about you go first.

09:50.527 --> 09:51.593
You want to start?

09:51.594 --> 09:52.361
This is ridiculous.

09:52.362 --> 09:53.329
No it's not, Josh.

09:53.330 --> 09:53.998
This, this is ridiculous.

09:54.198 --> 09:55.798
- Is this not ridiculous?
- I Googled it.

09:55.799 --> 09:56.298
You what?

09:56.299 --> 09:56.966
I Googled it.

09:57.166 --> 09:58.367
Case in point.

09:58.368 --> 10:02.338
I'm gonna get some air.

10:02.339 --> 10:06.276
Is there not air in here?

10:27.229 --> 10:28.363
You came.

10:28.364 --> 10:30.272
Of course I came.

10:36.272 --> 10:37.439
How you feeling?

10:37.440 --> 10:38.373
I'm good.

10:38.374 --> 10:41.309
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10:41.310 --> 10:43.482
I mean I, you know, considering.

10:45.482 --> 10:47.382
Um, Alex look, about the call...

10:47.383 --> 10:48.684
Don't, no no.

10:48.685 --> 10:51.949
Don't tell me that we're having
a party in honor of my suicide.

10:52.222 --> 10:55.591
Attempted suicide.

10:55.592 --> 10:59.699
Geez, if it were a suicide
we'd both be wearing suits.

11:02.638 --> 11:04.165
Can't treat it lightly, okay?

11:04.166 --> 11:07.169
Maybe we should get
him a muffin basket.

11:07.170 --> 11:09.338
I'm serious, the
first 48 hours...

11:09.339 --> 11:09.840
Alex!

11:10.040 --> 11:12.109
- Hi!
- Hey.

11:14.109 --> 11:16.411
Jesus, Alex.

11:16.412 --> 11:18.332
If you wanted to see all
of us, you could've just

11:18.333 --> 11:19.834
shot us an email.

11:23.085 --> 11:25.087
Wow.

11:25.088 --> 11:26.454
We were going to pick you up.

11:26.455 --> 11:27.615
Oh, no, don't worry about it.

11:27.616 --> 11:28.524
This was...

11:28.525 --> 11:30.726
Easy.

11:30.727 --> 11:32.694
Well.

11:32.695 --> 11:33.562
Do you need anything?

11:33.563 --> 11:35.064
Do you want to sit down?

11:35.065 --> 11:36.030
Um, I'm good.

11:36.031 --> 11:36.871
- You're hungry?
- No.

11:36.872 --> 11:38.352
Do you want me to
make you a sandwich?

11:38.353 --> 11:41.069
Um...

11:41.070 --> 11:44.339
No, I uh, actually I
think I'm going to go get

11:44.340 --> 11:45.275
changed.

11:45.276 --> 11:48.680
I feel a little gross,
you know what I mean?

11:51.680 --> 11:53.649
Um, I'll keep you company.

11:53.650 --> 11:56.086
Excuse me.

11:59.488 --> 12:02.458
Way to act normal, by the way.

12:02.459 --> 12:04.126
Way to be an asshole.

12:04.127 --> 12:06.562
Real nice, just...

12:06.563 --> 12:08.363
Sandwich, what, you want
to offer him anything

12:08.364 --> 12:09.698
else?

12:09.699 --> 12:11.599
So why'd you leave LA?

12:11.600 --> 12:15.270
Um, I don't know.

12:15.271 --> 12:20.242
I, I just, you know the
acting thing was only

12:20.243 --> 12:24.215
going okay, and the city's
a fucking soul killer.

12:25.815 --> 12:28.183
Yeah, I was running out
of cash, my mom was in

12:28.184 --> 12:32.556
fucking Bali, my dad left me
this, and you were, you know...

12:34.556 --> 12:36.494
We kind of lost touch.

12:38.253 --> 12:41.096
What I was going to say
outside, when you first came...

12:41.097 --> 12:44.699
Hey, the world's
got enough people.

12:44.700 --> 12:46.437
You have to
explain yourself, too.

12:48.405 --> 12:50.772
Josh is still an asshole.

12:50.773 --> 12:52.733
If he's going to be like
this all weekend, I swear

12:52.734 --> 12:53.409
to God...

12:53.410 --> 12:55.676
He's just dealing
with it, you know.

12:55.677 --> 12:56.712
In his own way.

12:56.713 --> 12:58.713
And shouldn't Isaac know
there's no such thing as a

12:58.714 --> 13:03.151
+1 to a friend's attempted
suicide weekend thing?

13:03.152 --> 13:04.392
It's not a fucking Bar Mitzvah.

13:04.393 --> 13:06.155
You know you sound like Josh.

13:06.156 --> 13:07.289
Oh my God, you're right.

13:07.290 --> 13:09.824
Ugh...

13:09.825 --> 13:10.793
How are you?

13:10.794 --> 13:13.094
How are you and Ben?

13:13.095 --> 13:14.663
We're fine.

13:14.664 --> 13:18.567
Okay, so, not so good fine.

13:18.568 --> 13:22.103
What's going on?

13:22.104 --> 13:23.104
Hey?

13:25.275 --> 13:28.510
I'm late.

13:28.511 --> 13:30.612
How late?

13:30.613 --> 13:32.782
Late late.

13:33.782 --> 13:36.084
Does Ben know?

13:36.085 --> 13:37.390
Nope.

13:40.390 --> 13:41.256
Hey.

13:41.257 --> 13:41.557
Hi.

13:41.757 --> 13:42.591
How you doing?

13:42.592 --> 13:43.357
Good.

13:43.358 --> 13:44.078
You need anything?

13:44.194 --> 13:45.260
No, I'm still fine.

13:45.261 --> 13:46.462
What?

13:46.463 --> 13:47.030
Here.

13:47.230 --> 13:50.131
Hey, where's the
bathroom in here?

13:50.132 --> 13:51.333
Use the one upstairs.

13:51.334 --> 13:52.368
Trust me.

13:56.439 --> 13:57.872
Isaac is calling.

13:57.873 --> 14:01.676
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

14:01.677 --> 14:02.644
<i>Really?</i>

14:02.645 --> 14:04.612
Can your +1 not use a GPS?

14:04.613 --> 14:07.140
I thought young people
were good at those things.

14:07.517 --> 14:09.286
Be nice, Sarah.

14:10.286 --> 14:12.223
Isaac is close, but lost.

14:13.054 --> 14:13.791
You know what?

14:13.991 --> 14:15.491
I'll just drive
out and meet him.

14:15.492 --> 14:16.732
I'm gonna go get some firewood.

14:16.733 --> 14:17.813
I'm gonna go pee in nature.

14:17.814 --> 14:19.346
I'll stay and watch Alex.

14:23.299 --> 14:24.366
I mean I'll...

14:24.367 --> 14:27.502
Put on some pasta for dinner.

14:27.503 --> 14:28.370
That sound good?

14:28.371 --> 14:31.173
That sounds great.

14:31.174 --> 14:32.306
You want to come with me?

14:32.307 --> 14:33.342
Yeah, I'll come with you.

14:33.343 --> 14:34.483
Great.

14:41.287 --> 14:43.919
You clearly have no idea
what you're doing, do you?

14:43.920 --> 14:45.927
Fuck you.

14:51.927 --> 14:53.395
Here, give me it.

14:53.396 --> 14:54.642
I know.

15:06.642 --> 15:08.544
Let me try again.

15:08.545 --> 15:10.312
No.

15:10.313 --> 15:10.813
No?

15:10.879 --> 15:12.680
No.

15:12.681 --> 15:15.684
I thought you all of calc
21, and then you went off

15:15.685 --> 15:18.353
and you did better
than me on the exam.

15:18.354 --> 15:20.622
I'm not teaching you
how to chop wood.

15:20.623 --> 15:22.623
It's not my fault you
have performance anxiety.

15:22.624 --> 15:24.430
I perform just fine.

15:28.430 --> 15:30.431
You don't have to
cook, you know.

15:30.432 --> 15:31.232
It's okay.

15:31.233 --> 15:33.901
It's the only thing
that relaxes me.

15:33.902 --> 15:36.671
Really?

15:36.672 --> 15:38.240
It's just...

15:38.241 --> 15:41.877
Been a while since
I've seen everyone.

15:41.878 --> 15:43.718
You know, if you need to
get something off your

15:43.719 --> 15:44.646
chest, you should...

15:44.647 --> 15:49.318
I don't need you of all
people to give me advice on...

15:49.319 --> 15:50.785
I'm sorry.

15:50.786 --> 15:52.688
No, it's...

15:52.689 --> 15:53.689
I didn't mean that.

15:53.690 --> 15:55.530
It's a fair point.

16:00.530 --> 16:05.500
What?

16:05.501 --> 16:06.401
They...

16:06.402 --> 16:08.402
Are here.

16:08.403 --> 16:09.972
Oh.

16:09.973 --> 16:13.976
She's hot.

16:13.977 --> 16:15.276
Your...

16:15.277 --> 16:16.377
Your boobs are bigger.

16:16.378 --> 16:17.550
That's not true.

16:20.550 --> 16:21.750
That's not true.

16:21.751 --> 16:24.422
Ugh.

16:27.422 --> 16:28.522
No they're not.

16:28.523 --> 16:29.992
Hey!

16:29.993 --> 16:31.693
Look who I found.

16:31.694 --> 16:32.861
Hey handsome.

16:32.862 --> 16:34.563
Oh, you didn't have to fly all
the way across the country.

16:34.564 --> 16:35.844
Are you kidding me? I wanted to.

16:35.845 --> 16:36.530
Alex, Kate.

16:36.531 --> 16:38.333
Kate, Alex.

16:38.334 --> 16:40.702
Hey, I-I've heard
a lot about you.

16:40.703 --> 16:41.969
I've heard a lot about you.

16:41.970 --> 16:44.539
What the fuck are those?

16:44.540 --> 16:46.675
That's how you say "hi" now?

16:46.676 --> 16:48.543
They're shiny and pointy.

16:48.544 --> 16:49.744
They're Italian, motherfucker.

16:49.745 --> 16:51.182
You look like a lumberjack.

16:52.649 --> 16:55.129
Oh, dude, if you'd told us
you were coming out of the

16:55.130 --> 16:57.268
closet we could've
thrown you a party.

16:57.487 --> 16:59.554
I told you my
friends are awesome.

16:59.555 --> 17:01.790
Um, is there a
bathroom I could-

17:01.791 --> 17:03.724
upstairs!

17:03.725 --> 17:07.496
Dinner is almost ready.

17:07.497 --> 17:08.663
Hey.

17:08.664 --> 17:09.664
Yeah.

17:19.709 --> 17:22.310
Sarah, this pasta is delicious.

17:22.311 --> 17:25.513
Mm, it is pasta and
sauce from a can.

17:25.515 --> 17:28.016
Tomorrow, I'll make
something real.

17:28.017 --> 17:30.651
Instagram tells me you're
still cooking a lot.

17:30.652 --> 17:32.586
Instagram lies.

17:32.587 --> 17:34.689
Unless Ramen counts.

17:34.690 --> 17:36.425
So that's what being
a lawyer's like.

17:36.426 --> 17:37.493
Fulfilling all your
hopes and dreams?

17:37.494 --> 17:39.561
Not all of us can stand to
destroy the planet on the

17:39.562 --> 17:41.028
backs of hedge funds.

17:41.029 --> 17:42.930
<i>That's not what I meant.</i>

17:42.931 --> 17:45.766
I'm just saying, look, we
graduated, aside, aside

17:45.767 --> 17:49.504
from you, at the onset of
the worst recession in 80 years.

17:49.505 --> 17:51.972
History says that most of
us will never regain the

17:51.973 --> 17:54.709
income levels that we
might have otherwise enjoyed.

17:54.710 --> 18:00.681
Isaac here is a beautiful anomaly,
and for that, we salute him.

18:00.682 --> 18:01.749
Thanks pal.

18:01.750 --> 18:04.018
Appreciate it.

18:04.019 --> 18:06.822
How's the uh, how's your
PhD going?

18:06.823 --> 18:07.788
<i>Mm.</i>

18:07.789 --> 18:09.056
What's that supposed to mean?

18:09.057 --> 18:10.425
It's just a simple question.

18:10.426 --> 18:11.493
Nah, it's had subtext.

18:11.494 --> 18:12.593
Oh, you want the subtext?

18:12.594 --> 18:13.754
Of course I want the subtext.

18:13.755 --> 18:15.195
Don't you know who
you're talking to?

18:15.196 --> 18:16.531
Did you forget who I am?

18:16.532 --> 18:18.532
<i>Okay, so how's life up on
your academic high horse,</i>

18:18.533 --> 18:21.635
uh, looking down on the
rest of us and despairing

18:21.636 --> 18:23.940
about the decline
of our culture?

18:24.940 --> 18:28.877
It's comments like those,
Isaac, that make me despair.

18:28.878 --> 18:30.918
Actually, Josh, sorry, but
I'd like to know what the

18:30.919 --> 18:32.781
hell you're doing there too.

18:32.782 --> 18:35.414
<i>Yeah, all joking aside,
what are you writing about?</i>

18:36.796 --> 18:38.954
I'm writing about the
future of biography.

18:38.955 --> 18:43.891
How our ever-expanding
digital footprint, emails,

18:43.892 --> 18:48.497
texts, tweets, will inform
our understanding of

18:48.498 --> 18:50.064
history and ourselves.

18:50.065 --> 18:51.833
Which is ironic.

18:51.834 --> 18:53.034
Why?

18:53.035 --> 18:56.103
Because I hate the modern world.

18:56.104 --> 18:58.172
Which era would you
rather have lived in?

18:58.173 --> 19:00.074
I'm sorry, what was
your name again?

19:00.075 --> 19:00.842
<i>It was Kate?</i>

19:00.843 --> 19:01.843
- Kate? Kate.
- Josh...

19:01.844 --> 19:03.564
I'm just saying,
I'm sorry. It's Kate? Kate?

19:03.565 --> 19:03.879
Yeah.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.720
<i>The only thing I hate
more than the present is</i>

19:05.721 --> 19:07.094
nostalgia for the past.

19:12.121 --> 19:13.361
Hey, you don't have to do that.

19:13.362 --> 19:14.656
No, no let me do something.

19:14.657 --> 19:15.524
Nope!

19:15.525 --> 19:16.725
You want to take shifts?

19:16.726 --> 19:19.795
He's compensating for the
fact that he can't chop wood.

19:19.796 --> 19:21.356
Oh my God, when'd you
get so mean, Josh?

19:21.357 --> 19:22.898
You're so mean.

19:22.899 --> 19:25.967
Probably the same time you
traded in for those shoes.

19:25.968 --> 19:28.368
This whole footwear smear campaign
is really cutting me deep.

19:28.369 --> 19:29.097
It's a real shame.

19:29.098 --> 19:30.874
Maybe you should commit suicide.

19:32.874 --> 19:34.708
What?

19:34.709 --> 19:36.076
Is it too s-
Alex is laughing.

19:36.077 --> 19:38.447
Look at that.

19:38.448 --> 19:39.950
That's a good joke.

19:40.950 --> 19:42.529
So how did you and Isaac meet?

19:43.219 --> 19:44.952
Mm...

19:44.953 --> 19:46.455
It's embarrassing.

19:46.456 --> 19:47.523
Why?

19:47.524 --> 19:51.125
Well, I was an, I was an
intern at his office, but

19:51.126 --> 19:53.762
we didn't start dating
until after I left, of course.

19:53.763 --> 19:55.630
Of course.

19:55.631 --> 19:57.603
I think it's sweet.

20:00.603 --> 20:02.070
Hey, I found two.

20:02.071 --> 20:03.839
Great.

20:03.840 --> 20:06.076
Thanks.

20:08.076 --> 20:10.010
So are you going
to go with that?

20:10.011 --> 20:11.011
Uh...

20:11.514 --> 20:13.834
There's a whole chapter
devoted to hair implants.

20:13.835 --> 20:15.075
You have to do it in his voice.

20:15.076 --> 20:18.786
Or, no. Exhibit B: The mature
man's guide to style.

20:18.787 --> 20:20.020
Oh my God, do not move.

20:20.021 --> 20:21.656
Hold that up right now.

20:21.657 --> 20:24.659
Please, just pose
with the cover please.

20:24.660 --> 20:25.794
Oh yeah.

20:25.795 --> 20:27.755
<i>Would you like to hear
the section on hair plugs?</i>

20:27.756 --> 20:30.899
How's your novel, Ben?

20:30.900 --> 20:32.633
It's good.

20:32.634 --> 20:34.535
It'll be done soon.

20:34.536 --> 20:38.773
Is it better or worse
than your New York story?

20:38.774 --> 20:42.009
It is, without a doubt, longer.

20:42.010 --> 20:43.111
<i>God, I loved that story.</i>

20:43.112 --> 20:44.778
It was so good.

20:44.779 --> 20:46.747
It's the only reason
Siri went out with me.

20:46.748 --> 20:47.681
That's not true.

20:47.682 --> 20:48.449
That's true.

20:48.450 --> 20:49.950
<i>- That's not true.
- It's true.</i>

20:49.951 --> 20:51.521
Maybe a little bit.

20:52.521 --> 20:56.858
I think I still
have a copy here.

20:56.859 --> 20:58.526
You know what we should do?

20:58.527 --> 21:00.795
We should stage a
dramatic reading.

21:00.796 --> 21:02.197
That is not going to happen.

21:02.198 --> 21:03.698
Can you imagine?

21:03.699 --> 21:05.166
Everybody would participate.

21:05.167 --> 21:07.002
I'll be the roommate,
you could play...

21:07.202 --> 21:09.610
Josh, really it's fine.

21:14.610 --> 21:15.310
Sarah.

21:15.311 --> 21:15.912
What?

21:16.112 --> 21:17.797
Enough with the
fucking pictures.

21:18.213 --> 21:20.916
I'm sorry, I'm recording
this for posterity.

21:20.917 --> 21:21.749
Is that okay?

21:21.750 --> 21:22.484
By what?

21:22.485 --> 21:23.645
By ruining it in the present?

21:23.646 --> 21:25.019
No, that's your job.

21:25.020 --> 21:26.086
Okay, come on.

21:26.087 --> 21:27.288
Hold on, hold on.

21:27.289 --> 21:27.891
That's okay.

21:28.091 --> 21:29.371
Sarah, let me ask you something.

21:29.372 --> 21:30.926
What?

21:30.927 --> 21:33.127
What, what are you going
to do with these pictures, huh?

21:33.228 --> 21:35.964
Are you going to post
them on Facebook?

21:35.965 --> 21:36.898
I don't know, maybe.

21:36.899 --> 21:37.966
Would that make you mad?

21:37.967 --> 21:39.047
<i>You're clinically obsessed.</i>

21:39.048 --> 21:41.008
I like to see what
my friends are up to. Big deal.

21:41.202 --> 21:43.705
So what, your news feed
tells you that Isaac got a

21:43.706 --> 21:47.641
new pair of Italian
loafers or Ben, Ben wrote

21:47.642 --> 21:49.577
a, a funny headline for
the post, and that makes

21:49.578 --> 21:51.079
you feel like you
still know somebody?

21:51.080 --> 21:54.649
Yeah, kind of, because
that's what people do now, Josh.

21:54.650 --> 21:55.984
People who care, at least.

21:55.985 --> 21:57.745
Well, you know what,
I'm sorry, but maybe I'd

21:57.746 --> 21:59.746
rather be in the fucking
dark as to what people are

21:59.747 --> 22:02.189
up to than mistake some
false level of intimacy

22:02.190 --> 22:03.624
for friendship.

22:03.625 --> 22:04.726
That is such bullshit.

22:04.727 --> 22:05.794
We're still friends.

22:05.795 --> 22:09.029
Isaac is on his BlackBerry
sending emails to San

22:09.030 --> 22:10.364
Francisco right now.

22:10.365 --> 22:12.100
Enough. Isaac...

22:12.101 --> 22:13.134
Yeah?

22:13.135 --> 22:16.705
Remember when I got
stoned for the first time?

22:16.706 --> 22:18.707
When we went to the
natural history museum?

22:18.708 --> 22:19.975
I remember you freaking out.

22:19.976 --> 22:21.110
<i>Yeah.</i>

22:21.111 --> 22:25.279
And you had to make me
dance and make me feel better?

22:25.280 --> 22:27.983
And you did the devil dance?

22:27.984 --> 22:28.717
Oh my God.

22:28.718 --> 22:29.718
<i>Devil dance.
Devil dance?</i>

22:29.719 --> 22:32.754
<i>- I totally
- it's my favorite thing.</i>

22:32.755 --> 22:34.355
I thought you hated dancing.

22:34.356 --> 22:37.891
Isaac doesn't d-, Isaac dances.

22:37.892 --> 22:40.295
Okay, so what was
Isaac like in college?

22:40.296 --> 22:40.962
Dorky.

22:41.162 --> 22:42.130
Uncultured.

22:42.131 --> 22:44.164
Pretty much exactly
what he is right now.

22:44.165 --> 22:45.165
I was pretty dorky.

22:45.200 --> 22:47.235
Okay, so you were
really adorable.

22:47.236 --> 22:49.208
Yeah, thanks.

22:52.208 --> 22:54.676
So what do you do, Kate?

22:54.677 --> 22:56.811
I work at a suicide and
crisis hotline for teens

22:56.812 --> 22:57.950
in the bay area.

23:01.550 --> 23:03.470
That sounded strange. I'm
sorry, I didn't realize

23:03.471 --> 23:04.919
until it came out of my mouth.

23:04.920 --> 23:06.200
Shame I didn't have your number.

23:06.201 --> 23:08.569
You could've solved
all my problems.

23:17.799 --> 23:20.834
Why did you lie?

23:20.835 --> 23:22.937
When?

23:22.938 --> 23:26.373
Alex, about the book.

23:26.374 --> 23:28.677
I didn't lie.

23:28.678 --> 23:31.248
I said the book will be
done soon and it will.

23:32.248 --> 23:34.682
Why not just say it's
still in research.

23:34.683 --> 23:35.750
Just, you know?

23:35.751 --> 23:39.120
Because maybe this weekend
isn't about my problems.

23:39.121 --> 23:41.355
If you want to schedule
some time to do that, we can

23:41.356 --> 23:43.093
find it.

23:44.093 --> 23:46.127
She seems really sweet.

23:46.128 --> 23:47.762
Stop it.

23:47.763 --> 23:50.998
Tell us all about your
illicit office romance.

23:50.999 --> 23:52.066
Hmm?

23:52.067 --> 23:53.267
You're being so annoying.

23:53.268 --> 23:55.070
Did you play naughty intern?

23:55.071 --> 23:56.071
That's not what happened.

23:56.205 --> 23:58.172
What, I think it's hot.

23:58.173 --> 23:59.708
Go to sleep.

23:59.709 --> 24:00.669
All of you, go to sleep.

24:00.670 --> 24:01.942
Get out of here.

24:01.943 --> 24:03.410
I'm ready to go to sleep.

24:03.411 --> 24:04.411
<i>I'm over it.</i>

24:04.412 --> 24:07.117
I'll go with you.

24:09.117 --> 24:09.918
Good night.

24:09.919 --> 24:10.718
Good night.

24:10.719 --> 24:11.452
Night guys.

24:11.453 --> 24:14.022
Night.

24:14.023 --> 24:15.890
Just gonna hang out?

24:15.891 --> 24:18.293
How many times does she
wake up during the night?

24:18.294 --> 24:20.214
Like do you have to feed
her, like, I don't know,

24:20.228 --> 24:22.029
hour and a half?

24:22.030 --> 24:23.031
You're such an asshole.

24:23.032 --> 24:24.792
Cause my friend, I have
some friends who have

24:24.793 --> 24:27.102
kids, and they say
it's like Vietnam.

24:27.103 --> 24:28.739
<i>Go fuck yourself.</i>

24:30.739 --> 24:34.141
He had been calling me a lot.

24:34.142 --> 24:36.076
Mm?

24:36.077 --> 24:40.180
Alex...

24:40.181 --> 24:50.181
Not too much to talk
about, just checking in.

24:50.191 --> 24:53.229
Always asking about the book.

24:54.120 --> 24:55.120
"How's the book?

24:55.163 --> 24:56.003
How's the book going?

24:56.004 --> 24:58.111
How you doing
on the book?"

25:03.005 --> 25:07.145
Got to the point where I
was screening his calls.

25:14.784 --> 25:16.553
The taste in my
mouth, it's good.

25:17.553 --> 25:18.553
Agh!

25:39.208 --> 25:42.377
Isn't it so funny how
we're all breathing under

25:42.378 --> 25:44.078
the same roof again.

25:45.381 --> 25:48.550
Do you ever wish we
could just go back?

25:48.551 --> 25:51.585
Sometimes.

25:51.586 --> 25:53.487
Actually, no I don't.

25:53.488 --> 25:54.922
I really don't.

25:54.923 --> 25:55.856
Why?

25:55.857 --> 25:56.891
Not at all.

25:56.892 --> 25:59.026
Because I...

25:59.027 --> 26:04.064
I don't know, I guess I
was mainly just scared.

26:04.065 --> 26:04.932
Of what?

26:04.933 --> 26:07.101
Of you all.

26:07.102 --> 26:09.137
The possibility that
you didn't like me.

26:09.138 --> 26:10.404
That's ridiculous.

26:10.405 --> 26:11.372
It's the truth.

26:11.373 --> 26:16.276
I remember that that
feeling did not go away.

26:16.277 --> 26:20.547
Until, um, until junior
year when Ben had me at

26:20.548 --> 26:24.485
his parents' place for Easter.

26:24.486 --> 26:26.153
We took the train
there and back.

26:26.154 --> 26:30.024
Barely talked, but you
know, it was, it was

26:30.025 --> 26:31.159
better than talking.

26:31.160 --> 26:37.031
It was just...

26:37.032 --> 26:38.911
Just nice.

26:49.911 --> 26:52.613
Hm?

26:52.614 --> 26:56.618
I don't know how to say this.

26:56.619 --> 27:01.421
But, have you ever thought
about going to therapy?

27:01.422 --> 27:04.258
Because, I've done
it a lot, and...

27:04.259 --> 27:04.794
You have?

27:04.994 --> 27:05.494
Yeah.

27:05.495 --> 27:08.129
Why?

27:08.130 --> 27:09.063
Seriously?

27:09.064 --> 27:10.198
Yeah, you're fine.

27:10.199 --> 27:16.237
Oh, um, let me think, how
I'm constantly anxious and

27:16.238 --> 27:21.074
I can never pinpoint why,
and how ever since college

27:21.075 --> 27:24.012
I can only be with guys
who are assholes or

27:24.013 --> 27:25.947
married or both...

27:25.948 --> 27:27.481
Has the therapy helped?

27:27.482 --> 27:29.484
I mean, I take Xanax now.

27:29.485 --> 27:33.454
That helps, and also, you
know, the other stuff is

27:33.455 --> 27:34.354
helpful.

27:34.355 --> 27:35.875
It's through, it's
complicated, though.

27:35.876 --> 27:38.426
My therapist kind of
thinks that it's very deep

27:38.427 --> 27:42.964
rooted in my childhood and...

27:42.965 --> 27:46.234
I'm s-sorry I'm
talking about myself.

27:46.235 --> 27:47.267
I'm so self-absorbed.

27:47.268 --> 27:48.436
This is why I'm in therapy.

27:48.437 --> 27:49.437
No it isn't!

27:49.438 --> 27:50.270
No it isn't.

27:50.271 --> 27:53.006
You just need sleep.

27:53.007 --> 27:55.176
I know, but are you okay?

27:55.177 --> 27:58.112
Do you need something
right now before we go to sleep?

27:58.113 --> 28:02.050
Sarah, you're going to have
to stop asking me that, okay?

28:02.051 --> 28:04.352
Mmm...

28:04.353 --> 28:06.454
You're very nice.

28:06.455 --> 28:09.556
Well, I think you're doing
a really good job, and I'm

28:09.557 --> 28:11.926
just going to wait here
until you fall asleep.

28:18.066 --> 28:19.066
Alright, forget it.

28:21.103 --> 28:23.004
Good night, thank you.

28:23.005 --> 28:24.706
I'm glad you're here.

28:24.707 --> 28:27.240
Isaac.

28:27.241 --> 28:28.609
Isaac.

28:28.610 --> 28:29.110
Isaac!

28:29.178 --> 28:30.244
Uh huh?

28:30.245 --> 28:31.645
You're awake?

28:31.646 --> 28:34.450
Unh...

28:35.450 --> 28:38.652
What do you like about me?

28:38.653 --> 28:39.554
What?

28:39.555 --> 28:41.689
You waited too long.

28:41.690 --> 28:44.592
Baby, it's the
middle of the light.

28:44.593 --> 28:46.473
Well now, now I can't
trust what you say because

28:46.474 --> 28:49.529
it didn't just come to you.

28:49.530 --> 28:53.468
Wait can we, can we just
talk about this in the morning?

28:53.469 --> 28:55.109
No, we can't talk about
it in the morning.

28:55.110 --> 28:58.472
I think, I think your
friends think I'm...

28:58.473 --> 29:00.274
Stupid and young.

29:00.275 --> 29:02.275
They don't think you're
stupid or young.

29:02.276 --> 29:03.194
You're neither.

29:03.211 --> 29:04.277
Go back to sleep.

29:04.278 --> 29:05.712
We'll talk about this tomorrow.

29:05.713 --> 29:08.288
But...

29:14.288 --> 29:15.422
Oh, hey.

29:15.423 --> 29:17.124
Hi.

29:17.125 --> 29:19.028
Oh, you know what I
wanted to tell you?

29:19.228 --> 29:20.468
What's that show that you like?

29:20.469 --> 29:23.031
The one with, with all the
ladies and they're in a city.

29:23.032 --> 29:24.032
What is it? What is that?

29:24.033 --> 29:24.900
The real housewives?

29:24.901 --> 29:25.866
- Yeah, I don't
- the real housewives.

29:25.867 --> 29:27.668
No, no, no, but I was
watching that show.

29:27.669 --> 29:28.768
No you weren't.

29:28.769 --> 29:31.805
No, it was on, and I was
there, and I couldn't look

29:31.806 --> 29:33.126
away, and do you
want to know why?

29:33.127 --> 29:34.042
Oh, shut up.

29:34.043 --> 29:35.410
Sarah, do you want to know why?

29:35.411 --> 29:38.079
Because I realized why you
love that show so much.

29:38.080 --> 29:43.689
Because at its core, it's
about the human condition.

29:47.689 --> 29:48.355
No.

29:48.356 --> 29:49.669
What?

30:04.605 --> 30:06.574
I thought they hated each other.

30:06.575 --> 30:07.641
They do and they don't.

30:07.642 --> 30:09.611
It's like a weird
game they play.

30:10.746 --> 30:13.847
Your friends are fucked up.

30:13.848 --> 30:16.384
They prefer complicated.

30:20.588 --> 30:21.823
Sarah and Josh.

30:21.824 --> 30:29.702
Just like old times.

30:34.702 --> 30:37.138
I wonder why I let
this keep happening.

30:37.139 --> 30:37.939
I don't know, Sarah.

30:37.940 --> 30:39.574
Maybe because you want it to.

30:39.575 --> 30:42.543
No, it's just something
I think I want and then

30:42.544 --> 30:48.282
later I feel awful about.

30:48.283 --> 30:49.316
You alright?

30:49.317 --> 30:50.317
Yes.

30:50.318 --> 30:53.487
Are Ben and Siri acting
weird, or is it just me?

30:53.488 --> 30:55.156
It's just you.

30:55.157 --> 30:56.690
You think they heard us?

30:56.691 --> 30:57.824
How would I know?

30:57.825 --> 30:58.659
Well, I don't know.

30:58.660 --> 31:00.428
She's a light
sleeper, that Siri.

31:00.429 --> 31:01.661
And you're very loud.

31:01.662 --> 31:02.763
You've gotten louder.

31:02.764 --> 31:05.466
What is that supposed
to mean "she's a light sleeper?"

31:05.467 --> 31:06.534
Oh, I thought you were
talking about the fact

31:06.535 --> 31:07.435
that you got louder.

31:07.436 --> 31:09.871
I don't, you know,
remember in college with

31:09.872 --> 31:11.805
those dorky little
orange earbuds?

31:11.806 --> 31:13.908
And she will still
complain about being woken

31:13.909 --> 31:16.143
up by the church bells?

31:16.144 --> 31:17.144
You're still in love with her.

31:17.145 --> 31:18.385
I'm not still in love with her.

31:18.386 --> 31:18.980
Yes you are.

31:19.180 --> 31:21.248
I'm not still in
love with her, Sarah.

31:21.249 --> 31:24.252
I just find it fascinating
that Ben seems to get

31:24.253 --> 31:25.820
everything that
he wants in life?

31:25.821 --> 31:27.755
Can I ask you a question?

31:27.756 --> 31:29.516
Where do you get off
thinking the whole world

31:29.517 --> 31:30.886
is conspiring against you?

31:31.226 --> 31:32.560
You want to go again?

31:32.561 --> 31:33.326
No.

31:33.327 --> 31:33.962
What?

31:34.162 --> 31:34.762
You're a dick.

31:34.763 --> 31:35.696
Yeah.

31:35.697 --> 31:37.331
All men are dicks, Sarah.

31:37.332 --> 31:38.632
We're hardwired that way.

31:38.633 --> 31:40.433
Yeah, but you're a dick
who thinks he's better

31:40.434 --> 31:42.269
than a dick because he
can back up his dickish

31:42.270 --> 31:44.872
behavior with psychobabble
and pseudoscience.

31:44.873 --> 31:46.306
Yeah, blah blah blah blah blah.

31:46.307 --> 31:47.240
Let's go again.

31:47.241 --> 31:48.241
I don't want to.

31:48.242 --> 31:49.962
I think it would be a
good idea to go again.

31:49.963 --> 31:51.245
You can't go again.

31:51.246 --> 31:52.366
I can go again.

32:20.706 --> 32:23.443
<i>There are three stages
of finding friends in college.</i>

32:23.444 --> 32:25.645
<i>The first is desperation.</i>

32:25.646 --> 32:27.747
<i>Second is panic.</i>

32:27.748 --> 32:30.985
<i>The third is fate.</i>

32:30.986 --> 32:32.706
<i>When you wind up at
the same table together</i>

32:32.707 --> 32:35.433
<i>somehow, then your
real life begins.</i>

32:58.313 --> 32:59.815
Busted!

33:02.985 --> 33:04.619
Does everyone else know.

33:04.620 --> 33:06.653
Paper-thin walls.

33:06.654 --> 33:09.856
Perfect.

33:09.857 --> 33:11.993
No one is judging.

33:11.994 --> 33:14.394
Ugh, besides me.

33:14.395 --> 33:18.266
It's like I'm this mature,
successful, adult woman,

33:18.267 --> 33:20.147
except when I'm with Josh,
it's like I'm back in

33:20.148 --> 33:22.902
sophomore year and I'm
just total insecure, and...

33:22.903 --> 33:23.804
It's complicated.

33:23.805 --> 33:25.640
He was your first.

33:25.641 --> 33:26.841
It's not complicated.

33:26.842 --> 33:28.008
He's using me.

33:28.009 --> 33:30.378
Who's to say you
aren't using him?

33:30.379 --> 33:32.747
My therapist, actually.

33:32.748 --> 33:36.784
Josh is a man-child who
uses sex, I'm serious, as

33:36.785 --> 33:40.321
a means of processing
deep-seated emotional issues.

33:40.322 --> 33:42.657
And you are an overworked
tax attorney who could

33:42.658 --> 33:43.690
stand to get laid.

33:43.691 --> 33:45.660
I'm a...

33:45.661 --> 33:47.581
Mergers and acquisitions
attorney who could stand

33:47.582 --> 33:49.529
to get laid, thank you.

33:49.530 --> 33:50.297
Whatever.

33:50.298 --> 33:51.439
Are you still...

33:57.439 --> 33:58.906
With...

33:58.907 --> 34:03.015
I think I might be a little...

34:07.015 --> 34:08.516
What?

34:08.516 --> 34:10.418
You don't run.

34:10.418 --> 34:11.819
Well, I'm thinking
of picking it up.

34:11.820 --> 34:13.120
Alex, you're still recovering.

34:13.121 --> 34:14.420
Why don't you take it easy?

34:14.422 --> 34:17.324
I can always stop.

34:17.326 --> 34:20.695
I have been trying to get
motivated all morning.

34:20.696 --> 34:21.695
Come with me.

34:21.696 --> 34:23.929
Yeah?

34:23.931 --> 34:25.398
How'd you sleep?

34:25.399 --> 34:26.733
Fine, why?

34:26.734 --> 34:28.467
Really?

34:28.469 --> 34:30.509
Just wanted to make
sure you weren't being attacked.

34:30.510 --> 34:33.840
- There was a lot of...
- God.

34:33.841 --> 34:34.974
So how's Brooklyn?

34:34.975 --> 34:36.577
It's fine.

34:36.578 --> 34:38.012
Come visit.

34:38.013 --> 34:39.547
Sorry, sorry sorry.

34:40.681 --> 34:41.815
You okay?

34:41.817 --> 34:45.885
Yeah.

34:45.886 --> 34:48.688
You'd better be fine.

34:48.688 --> 34:52.559
I um, I saw the pictures
you posted the other day.

34:52.560 --> 34:53.594
Yeah?

34:53.596 --> 34:55.516
Uh, were you and Ben went
to all the thrift shops

34:55.516 --> 34:56.063
and...

34:56.063 --> 34:58.465
Made your place
look so home-like?

34:58.466 --> 34:59.633
Yeah.

34:59.634 --> 35:01.101
Yeah I did.

35:01.102 --> 35:04.607
Now all you need is
a golden retriever.

35:06.607 --> 35:09.809
What?

35:09.810 --> 35:11.845
What's going on?

35:11.846 --> 35:13.747
I got a job offer in LA.

35:13.748 --> 35:15.148
<i>Alright!</i>

35:15.149 --> 35:16.717
It's a dream kind of offer.

35:16.718 --> 35:19.086
That's great.

35:19.087 --> 35:23.657
So then what's the bad news?

35:23.658 --> 35:26.760
Ben's been resisting
at every turn.

35:26.761 --> 35:29.796
Fighting a lot about
going, fighting about

35:29.797 --> 35:33.867
staying, just, we haven't
even made love in...

35:33.868 --> 35:35.101
Weeks, and.

35:35.102 --> 35:37.171
Didn't need to know that part.

35:37.172 --> 35:40.576
I'm sorry, I...

35:41.498 --> 35:44.077
I just think some space
would be good for us both.

35:44.078 --> 35:46.884
Wait, wait, no, no, um...

35:48.884 --> 35:51.485
You and Ben are
going to be fine.

35:51.486 --> 35:52.420
Okay?

35:52.421 --> 35:54.101
Ben's probably just
stressed out right now.

35:54.102 --> 35:55.034
He'll figure it out.

35:55.035 --> 35:57.858
He'll finish his book and...

35:57.859 --> 35:59.827
What?

35:59.828 --> 36:02.829
Ben is...

36:02.830 --> 36:08.034
Well, for starters he's blocked.

36:08.035 --> 36:10.037
Blocked?

36:10.038 --> 36:14.642
Please, don't say
anything, obviously.

36:14.643 --> 36:16.907
He hasn't written
anything in almost a year.

36:21.783 --> 36:24.050
Ha ha, look who it is.

36:24.051 --> 36:26.019
It's about time, you lazy bum.

36:26.020 --> 36:27.588
Lazy?

36:27.589 --> 36:31.727
It's not like you let
me sleep, you and Sarah.

36:32.727 --> 36:34.628
How's Siri?

36:34.629 --> 36:37.731
Siri...

36:37.732 --> 36:39.700
Is on a run.

36:39.701 --> 36:41.674
Okay.

36:45.674 --> 36:46.674
And she's back.

36:47.209 --> 36:50.010
Ben, can I ask you something?

36:50.011 --> 36:55.182
Was it difficult, as a couple,
when the iPhone 4s came out?

36:55.183 --> 36:58.818
Because I can imagine,
here you are, minding your

36:58.819 --> 37:06.194
own business, and then everybody's
asking her a question.

37:07.194 --> 37:09.167
You're a fucking idiot.

37:12.167 --> 37:12.999
<i>Just a second!</i>

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
Oh.

37:19.975 --> 37:20.907
It's all yours.

37:20.908 --> 37:21.709
Thank you.

37:21.710 --> 37:23.011
Hey, um...

37:24.011 --> 37:26.613
I'm sorry about what
I said last night.

37:26.614 --> 37:27.114
I'm...

37:27.181 --> 37:28.249
It's okay.

37:28.250 --> 37:29.383
Don't worry.

37:29.384 --> 37:31.751
You're not even 48 hours
removed from a traumatic event.

37:31.752 --> 37:34.072
You're suddenly the center
of love and attention and you're

37:34.073 --> 37:36.023
feeling mildly manic
and also oddly angry.

37:36.024 --> 37:37.864
I imagine you're also
experiencing mood-cycling

37:37.865 --> 37:39.785
and you're scared as hell
of the next time you'll

37:39.786 --> 37:40.927
crash, so, no.

37:40.928 --> 37:42.665
I'm not taking it personally.

37:43.665 --> 37:44.165
Good.

37:44.232 --> 37:45.633
Don't worry, though.

37:45.634 --> 37:47.881
You'll level off.

37:59.881 --> 38:02.115
What, uh...

38:02.116 --> 38:03.851
What style of yoga is that?

38:03.852 --> 38:06.189
What, what form is that?

38:09.189 --> 38:12.726
I took a yoga class once.

38:12.727 --> 38:14.877
Yeah, but it wasn't for me.

38:29.877 --> 38:31.948
No, yeah, uh, mhmm.

38:33.948 --> 38:35.633
I'm going to give
you some space.

38:39.321 --> 38:40.427
You know what I miss?

38:40.428 --> 38:42.722
I miss living down
the hall from you.

38:42.723 --> 38:45.025
I could always pop over
whenever I wanted to talk.

38:45.026 --> 38:46.726
You just hate sleeping
alone and you needed

38:46.727 --> 38:48.929
somebody to talk to about Josh.

38:48.930 --> 38:50.664
Don't be naive.

38:50.665 --> 38:55.034
Don't be naive about what?

38:55.035 --> 38:56.670
Isaac...

38:56.671 --> 38:58.871
Sarah...

38:58.872 --> 39:02.210
I always wanted
you to make a move.

39:03.210 --> 39:05.614
That's funny.

39:06.614 --> 39:09.717
I'm serious.

39:09.718 --> 39:11.052
But you always,

39:11.053 --> 39:14.655
you always said that we shouldn't
because were such good friends.

39:14.656 --> 39:19.726
Oh, yes, that is what I
said, but that is not what

39:19.727 --> 39:20.727
I wanted.

39:22.046 --> 39:23.731
You're impossible,
you know that?

39:23.732 --> 39:24.465
I'm impossible?

39:24.466 --> 39:26.099
Yeah, you're totally impossible.

39:26.100 --> 39:27.967
You're impossible!

39:27.968 --> 39:29.670
Shit!

39:29.671 --> 39:30.705
Sorry that...

39:33.608 --> 39:34.608
Oh, is that butter?

39:34.609 --> 39:36.089
No no no, don't wipe
it off, I got it.

39:36.090 --> 39:37.450
- It's cream right there.
- Cheese.

39:37.451 --> 39:39.399
It's cream cheese! Perfect!
Thank you.

39:39.747 --> 39:41.116
I'm gonna go wash up babe.

39:43.917 --> 39:45.151
Morning.

39:45.152 --> 39:47.158
Good morning.

39:51.158 --> 39:54.695
I've got great
Southern exposure, so I

39:54.696 --> 39:56.764
was thinking of
installing a solar array.

39:56.765 --> 40:00.434
And um, maybe a few
rainwater basins too.

40:00.435 --> 40:01.568
That sounds great, Alex.

40:01.569 --> 40:03.970
Then you'd have everything
you need to start a cult.

40:03.971 --> 40:06.106
I'm in.

40:06.107 --> 40:08.809
Hey, what do you think the
girls are doing right now?

40:08.810 --> 40:10.943
I don't know, their hair?

40:10.944 --> 40:13.380
What if we propose
an elaborate swap.

40:13.381 --> 40:15.048
Yeah, I think you'd be thrilled.

40:15.049 --> 40:16.784
The numbers aren't even.

40:16.785 --> 40:17.784
Ow!

40:17.785 --> 40:18.905
The numbers are plenty even.

40:18.906 --> 40:20.387
I've done, look...

40:20.388 --> 40:22.956
Alex, you get sweet nubile Kate.

40:22.957 --> 40:24.191
Oh great.

40:24.192 --> 40:25.291
Isaac, you get Sarah.

40:25.292 --> 40:27.212
I get Siri, 'cause, well,
that's all that's left.

40:27.213 --> 40:30.430
And Ben, you get published
in the new yorker.

40:30.431 --> 40:31.435
That's hilarious.

40:37.906 --> 40:38.906
The fuck was that?

40:39.207 --> 40:41.710
I don't know, a dog?

40:44.440 --> 40:46.914
Well, the boys better be
close, or they're gonna

40:46.915 --> 40:48.282
get drenched.

40:48.283 --> 40:50.883
You want to go on a food run?

40:50.884 --> 40:52.324
I've just been
feeling a little sick.

40:52.325 --> 40:54.921
I'll go.

40:54.922 --> 40:56.055
Oh, would you?

40:56.056 --> 40:57.157
<i>Yeah.</i>

40:57.158 --> 40:58.925
Great.

40:58.926 --> 41:01.095
Would you, uh, pick
something up for me?

41:01.096 --> 41:03.097
Yes.

41:03.098 --> 41:03.930
- Now?
- Yeah.

41:03.931 --> 41:05.164
Let's go.

41:05.165 --> 41:06.099
Cool.

41:06.100 --> 41:08.001
Have fun!

41:08.002 --> 41:10.003
Boy, where'd you come from?

41:10.004 --> 41:12.371
There aren't that
many houses over here.

41:12.372 --> 41:15.342
Hello?

41:15.343 --> 41:17.846
Anyone lose a dog?

41:18.846 --> 41:20.481
She looks hungry.

41:20.482 --> 41:21.362
You want some of that?

41:21.363 --> 41:22.563
Whoa, what are you doing, man?

41:22.564 --> 41:23.983
You don't feed a strange dog.

41:23.984 --> 41:25.052
Why not?

41:25.053 --> 41:26.019
Cause you'll just confuse
it and make everything

41:26.020 --> 41:26.987
worse.

41:26.988 --> 41:28.387
That's bullshit.

41:28.388 --> 41:30.348
Hey, look, as much as I
want to hang out with this

41:30.349 --> 41:33.392
dog all day long, um, has anyone
else noticed it's pouring?

41:33.393 --> 41:34.894
We can't just leave it here.

41:34.895 --> 41:36.335
Owner should've put
some tags on him.

41:36.336 --> 41:37.396
Owner should've what?

41:37.397 --> 41:39.432
Let me see your pen.

41:39.433 --> 41:42.381
Okay, so the dog should be
punished for its owner's sins?

41:43.504 --> 41:46.173
Are you a republican now?

41:46.174 --> 41:48.175
So what if I am?

41:48.176 --> 41:52.546
So what if, what?

41:52.547 --> 41:55.381
Ben, did he tell you about this?

41:55.382 --> 41:56.950
Yum, grape...

41:56.951 --> 41:58.284
Hey, will this work?

41:58.285 --> 42:02.555
Uh, oh God no, that's not good.

42:02.556 --> 42:05.459
So, when did you and Isaac meet?

42:05.460 --> 42:06.492
Freshman year.

42:06.493 --> 42:08.427
He lived down the hall from me.

42:08.428 --> 42:10.863
I was so nervous to
come on this trip.

42:10.864 --> 42:11.731
Really?

42:11.732 --> 42:13.934
Isaac looks up to
you guys so much.

42:13.935 --> 42:15.401
It's like...

42:15.402 --> 42:17.470
Meeting his parents but
worse, because there's

42:17.471 --> 42:18.472
five of you.

42:18.473 --> 42:21.141
Well, be thankful you're
not meeting his parents.

42:21.142 --> 42:27.581
His mom is crazy.

42:27.582 --> 42:31.050
I'm so jealous of you.

42:31.051 --> 42:32.052
Why?

42:32.053 --> 42:34.521
Because, you guys just
have all these shared

42:34.522 --> 42:37.356
experiences that
I'll never have.

42:37.357 --> 42:38.992
Well, you know Isaac.

42:38.993 --> 42:40.193
He was...

42:40.194 --> 42:42.563
Shy and sweet.

42:42.564 --> 42:43.564
Really sweet.

42:44.110 --> 42:46.532
He's the only one of us
from the Midwest, so...

42:46.533 --> 42:50.436
He's the least neurotic
of the bunch by far.

42:50.437 --> 42:52.072
I can see that.

42:52.073 --> 42:53.072
Yeah.

42:53.073 --> 42:54.993
He takes me out to fancy
dinners all the time and

42:54.994 --> 43:00.034
it's really nice, but
it's not why I like him.

43:00.582 --> 43:02.249
Why do you like him?

43:02.250 --> 43:05.251
Because he's grounded.

43:05.252 --> 43:06.452
And he's so kind.

43:06.453 --> 43:08.387
And...

43:08.388 --> 43:09.668
The other day, we celebrated our

43:09.669 --> 43:11.490
quarter-year anniversary.

43:11.491 --> 43:12.544
Which is ridiculous.

43:13.227 --> 43:14.262
It's so ridiculous.

43:14.263 --> 43:18.999
But it made me really
happy, and I think he's

43:19.000 --> 43:24.238
got the right priorities,
which is rare.

43:24.239 --> 43:25.438
Everything okay.

43:25.439 --> 43:26.907
Yeah.

43:26.908 --> 43:29.309
Ugh! So many mushrooms.

43:29.310 --> 43:30.577
Ooh, watermelon.

43:30.578 --> 43:32.218
There you are.

43:37.218 --> 43:39.019
Hey, big news.

43:39.020 --> 43:39.987
What?

43:39.988 --> 43:41.555
Isaac voted for bush.

43:41.556 --> 43:43.322
That's not the news.

43:43.323 --> 43:45.559
We found a dog.

43:45.560 --> 43:48.327
Oh my God.

43:48.328 --> 43:50.030
Where did you guys find it?

43:50.031 --> 43:52.164
At the river in the woods.

43:52.165 --> 43:53.901
I'm going to go take a shower.

43:53.902 --> 43:56.222
Alex, hold on, would you give
me one second, I can come in.

43:56.223 --> 43:57.237
What, what, what, what?

43:57.238 --> 43:59.338
You're gonna come with
me and, and bathe me?

43:59.339 --> 44:00.699
That's not what I
was going to say.

44:00.700 --> 44:04.144
Okay, I'm fucking fine, okay?

44:04.145 --> 44:05.145
Okay?

44:05.212 --> 44:06.212
Everybody, I...

44:06.214 --> 44:08.548
Thank you for your
concern, but I am fucking

44:08.549 --> 44:12.019
fine, and just please,
stop following me around,

44:12.020 --> 44:13.656
okay?

44:15.656 --> 44:20.293
What do we do?

44:20.294 --> 44:22.362
He said he's fucking fine.

44:22.363 --> 44:23.843
I'm going to check
on him in a minute.

44:23.844 --> 44:26.233
You know, I think he is, okay?

44:26.234 --> 44:28.968
How do you know?

44:28.969 --> 44:30.674
I just know.

44:32.674 --> 44:34.006
Hey.

44:34.007 --> 44:34.675
Ha!

44:34.676 --> 44:36.476
Sweet nectar and ambrosia.

44:36.477 --> 44:37.978
There's more in the car.

44:37.979 --> 44:39.515
Oh my gosh!

44:40.515 --> 44:42.182
Who is this!

44:42.183 --> 44:43.050
You know Josh.

44:43.051 --> 44:46.087
He makes friends
everywhere he goes.

44:47.087 --> 44:48.988
I missed you.

44:48.989 --> 44:53.194
I missed you too.

45:01.569 --> 45:02.668
Jeff Goldblum.

45:02.669 --> 45:03.470
Done.

45:03.471 --> 45:04.438
Jeff Goldblum!

45:04.439 --> 45:06.039
Yeah.

45:06.040 --> 45:07.474
The dog was in the fly?

45:07.475 --> 45:08.441
I think it's good.

45:08.442 --> 45:09.976
You don't name
a dog "Jeff."

45:09.977 --> 45:11.378
Why would it be
named Jeff Goldblum?

45:11.379 --> 45:13.699
It wouldn't be named Jeff,
it would be named Jeff Goldblum.

45:13.700 --> 45:15.580
How do you know the dog
is Jewish, first of all?

45:15.581 --> 45:15.916
How did you just assume?

45:16.116 --> 45:17.196
How did you make that call?

45:17.197 --> 45:19.385
That's the dog's name. You're
welcome.

45:19.386 --> 45:20.653
Jeff Goldblum.

45:20.654 --> 45:23.356
Then name the dog, please.

45:23.357 --> 45:25.291
I think he likes the name Timmy.

45:25.292 --> 45:26.392
Timmy, you're good, huh?

45:26.393 --> 45:27.593
Timmy's a good name.

45:27.594 --> 45:30.030
Come here, come here, come here.

45:30.031 --> 45:31.700
Shh, shh.

45:32.700 --> 45:34.535
Wait, hold on guys, seriously.

45:35.636 --> 45:37.637
I think I can hear
Timmy's thoughts.

45:37.638 --> 45:41.641
Gee, I sure am glad I'm inside
right now.

45:41.642 --> 45:44.116
Instead of being out there
in the cold and rain.

45:44.316 --> 45:46.472
The mean man with the
effeminate shoes didn't

45:46.473 --> 45:47.246
want me to come.

45:47.247 --> 45:48.782
Hey!

45:48.783 --> 45:50.550
Timmy would kill
for these shoes.

45:50.551 --> 45:53.452
But I'll bite his ass later.

45:53.453 --> 45:56.356
Why do we just assume
that dogs talk like that?

45:56.357 --> 45:58.277
I mean, it's not like a
dog just opened his mouth

45:58.278 --> 46:00.126
one day and that's what
it sounded like and we

46:00.127 --> 46:01.765
assigned that voice to it.

46:04.765 --> 46:06.266
Ignore them, Timmy.

46:06.267 --> 46:06.934
Timmy?

46:07.134 --> 46:08.134
That's his name.

46:09.486 --> 46:11.171
Hey, I just thought
of something.

46:11.172 --> 46:12.171
What?

46:12.172 --> 46:14.074
Um, I told Siri earlier
how much I loved your

46:14.075 --> 46:16.443
place, and all you guys
were missing was a dog,

46:16.444 --> 46:18.278
and now...

46:18.279 --> 46:19.646
One appears!

46:19.647 --> 46:21.616
You have your chance.

46:22.616 --> 46:24.517
We're not getting a dog.

46:24.518 --> 46:25.485
Siri, it's not a dog.

46:25.486 --> 46:26.485
It's Timmy.

46:26.486 --> 46:28.021
<i>Yeah.</i>

46:28.022 --> 46:31.525
I'm not just a dog, I need a
house, and I like you

46:31.526 --> 46:34.360
guys the best.

46:34.361 --> 46:35.761
<i>You guys have that
little backyard.</i>

46:35.762 --> 46:37.097
It can run back and forth...

46:37.098 --> 46:38.064
Yeah.

46:38.065 --> 46:40.733
Timmy, where do you want to go?

46:40.734 --> 46:43.537
He says, he says
he wants it too.

46:43.538 --> 46:45.373
That's too bad.

46:46.373 --> 46:48.775
So, uh, what are
we making Sarah?

46:48.776 --> 46:54.280
We are making chilled
watermelon soup and sea scallop

46:54.281 --> 46:55.247
Risotto.

46:55.248 --> 46:55.748
<i>What?</i>

46:55.917 --> 46:56.957
<i>What are we making again?</i>

46:56.958 --> 46:58.558
<i>I'm sorry, can you
do something helpful?</i>

46:58.559 --> 46:59.485
Did you say Risotto?

46:59.486 --> 47:01.655
Can you please do
something helpful?

47:01.656 --> 47:03.824
The joint's not going
to roll itself, Sarah.

47:03.825 --> 47:06.126
And I'm making a magical
appetizer dish that's

47:06.127 --> 47:09.162
going to make your
Risotto so much better.

47:09.163 --> 47:10.363
Alright, please?

47:10.364 --> 47:11.431
Please what?

47:14.268 --> 47:15.534
Uh oh.

47:15.535 --> 47:18.271
What?

47:18.272 --> 47:20.372
Give me a break, I'm
not listening to that.

47:20.373 --> 47:21.842
What?

47:21.843 --> 47:24.311
It's like we're gripped by
this never-ending nostalgia

47:24.312 --> 47:26.813
for our parents' music.

47:26.814 --> 47:29.115
It's oppressive.

47:29.116 --> 47:31.151
What about Bruce
Springsteen is oppressive?

47:31.152 --> 47:33.112
Let me tell you something
about Bruce Springsteen,

47:33.113 --> 47:33.353
okay?

47:33.354 --> 47:35.621
Never, never trust anyone
who is that passionate

47:35.622 --> 47:37.824
about the state of New Jersey.

47:37.825 --> 47:39.659
<i>You are so full of shit.</i>

47:39.660 --> 47:42.295
<i>Okay.</i>

47:42.296 --> 47:42.796
Hmm?

47:42.863 --> 47:43.823
What is he gonna do now.

47:43.824 --> 47:46.166
What've we got.

47:46.167 --> 47:47.334
Arcade fire?

47:47.335 --> 47:48.568
Yes. Arcade fucking fire.

47:48.569 --> 47:49.069
What?

47:49.136 --> 47:50.436
What's wrong with this.

47:50.437 --> 47:52.238
Too Canadian.

47:52.239 --> 47:54.273
What does that mean?

47:54.274 --> 47:56.510
Too Canadian, really?

47:56.511 --> 47:57.843
Does, does this
look too Canadian?

47:57.844 --> 47:58.811
Really?

47:58.812 --> 47:59.746
But who knows.

47:59.747 --> 48:00.680
I don't know.

48:00.681 --> 48:02.581
Maybe it fits our
postmodern profile for a

48:02.582 --> 48:05.385
Canadian band to best
express American anxiety

48:05.386 --> 48:08.454
during this gradual
post-empire period of decline.

48:08.455 --> 48:11.191
Blah, blah, blah,
bullshit, blah.

48:11.192 --> 48:12.925
Miss Kate?

48:12.926 --> 48:15.729
Oh I don't,
I don't normally smoke.

48:15.730 --> 48:19.699
Honey, it's not going to bite.

48:19.700 --> 48:20.867
Okay.

48:20.868 --> 48:22.936
Fine.

48:22.937 --> 48:25.774
<i>I like Kate.</i>

48:27.774 --> 48:29.547
There you go.

48:32.547 --> 48:33.547
<i>Alright.</i>

48:39.453 --> 48:41.521
<i>Alex, where did you
get these records?</i>

48:41.522 --> 48:43.490
<i>I feel like I'm
at a garage sale.</i>

48:43.491 --> 48:46.497
I, I bought them at a garage
sale.

48:49.497 --> 48:51.597
Babe?

48:51.598 --> 48:53.669
I'm okay.

48:54.669 --> 48:56.802
What's going on?

48:56.803 --> 48:58.704
Come on...

48:58.705 --> 49:00.840
Look, if now is not the
time to get fucked up, I

49:00.841 --> 49:04.677
really, I don't.. I
don't know when is.

49:04.678 --> 49:05.878
<i>Fuck it.</i>

49:05.879 --> 49:06.880
I'm dancing.

49:06.881 --> 49:08.914
I'm gonna dance too.

49:08.915 --> 49:10.282
Oh, here we go.

49:10.283 --> 49:15.255
You should prepare
yourself for this.

49:15.256 --> 49:16.941
This is what you
call a home run.

49:17.225 --> 49:18.699
- Turn it up!
- That's right.

49:22.395 --> 49:25.664
See that? Isaac,
who's the dancer now?

49:25.665 --> 49:28.534
That's right Kate, Isaac
don't know these moves.

49:28.535 --> 49:30.114
He won't show you these moves.

49:45.685 --> 49:46.519
Hello.

49:46.520 --> 49:48.387
What is up?

49:48.388 --> 49:49.990
This looks terrible.

49:49.991 --> 49:52.525
Thanks.

49:52.526 --> 49:58.631
How serious were
you this morning?

49:58.632 --> 50:00.566
About what?

50:00.567 --> 50:03.769
You know what.

50:03.770 --> 50:07.907
I just thought...

50:07.908 --> 50:10.010
No, you know what, I'm
sorry I said anything.

50:10.011 --> 50:12.579
I shouldn't have said anything.

50:12.580 --> 50:15.750
I'm not sorry.

50:16.750 --> 50:17.750
I'm not sorry.

50:23.491 --> 50:25.724
- Okay, then...
- Isaac!

50:25.725 --> 50:26.526
Yeah.

50:26.527 --> 50:28.061
Get your anti-government
ass in here.

50:28.062 --> 50:29.866
Come on.

50:32.767 --> 50:38.839
I gotta go show those
fools how to dance.

Nothing.

51:19.946 --> 51:22.048
Nothing?

51:22.049 --> 51:23.951
Since when do you
turn down a joint?

51:24.951 --> 51:28.497
I'm just not in the mood.

51:37.219 --> 51:38.430

looks half like you and

52:22.009 --> 52:25.845
half like me.

53:50.196 --> 53:52.569
Wow.

53:56.569 --> 53:59.613
Mm.

54:05.613 --> 54:09.014
This food is so
incredible, Sarah.

54:09.015 --> 54:10.017
Oh God.

54:12.785 --> 54:14.586
You guys, you're welcome.

54:14.587 --> 54:15.987
You are incredibly
stoned right now.

54:15.988 --> 54:17.388
I would just like
to point that out.

54:17.389 --> 54:19.959
Sarah, we are barely high.

54:19.960 --> 54:21.528
Come on.

54:21.529 --> 54:25.564
Okay, some of us
might be a little high.

54:25.565 --> 54:26.266
Oh, sweetie.

54:26.267 --> 54:28.267
Oh, I'm sorry.

54:28.268 --> 54:31.304
I just really like how
cold it feels on my tongue.

54:31.305 --> 54:32.438
Okay.

54:32.439 --> 54:33.606
How come you haven't opened
up your own restaurant yet?

54:33.607 --> 54:34.740
What's the deal?

54:34.741 --> 54:37.843
Mm, it's called
law school loans.

54:37.844 --> 54:40.179
How come we didn't do
more drugs in college?

54:40.180 --> 54:41.246
That's a good question.

54:41.247 --> 54:43.782
I figured that I would be
far less curious now if I

54:43.783 --> 54:47.754
had just done a better job of
doing more drugs in college.

54:49.256 --> 54:51.496
Well, you know we had a
good run freshman year.

54:51.497 --> 54:53.559
Mhmm.

54:53.560 --> 54:55.961
You remember that time
Siri ate that weed brownie

54:55.962 --> 54:58.030
and ran through someone's
yard buck-naked?

54:58.031 --> 54:59.197
Stop it!

54:59.198 --> 55:00.833
Oh touchy!

55:00.834 --> 55:01.834
It's true! You did!

55:01.835 --> 55:03.001
Stop it!

55:03.002 --> 55:05.171
What happened to us?

55:05.172 --> 55:06.606
We got serious.

55:06.607 --> 55:07.487
And we got girlfriend.

55:07.488 --> 55:09.075
Oh, hey, okay.

55:09.076 --> 55:11.577
You know what this is like?

55:11.578 --> 55:13.845
This is like one of
those '80s movies.

55:13.846 --> 55:14.847
<i>What?</i>

55:14.848 --> 55:16.014
Like one of those movies
where there's like a big

55:16.015 --> 55:17.316
group of people...

55:17.317 --> 55:19.151
I just don't see why
everything in our lives

55:19.152 --> 55:21.653
has to be like something else.

55:21.654 --> 55:22.921
That's real deep Siri.

55:22.922 --> 55:23.923
I'm serious.

55:23.924 --> 55:25.804
It's like we can't just
experience something and

55:25.805 --> 55:26.291
let it be.

55:26.292 --> 55:28.795
'Cause that's the way
the people relate today.

55:28.796 --> 55:30.476
They don't, they don't
talk about anything.

55:30.477 --> 55:31.597
They just reference things.

55:31.598 --> 55:32.764
Thank, thank you.

55:32.765 --> 55:34.066
Oh yeah, I had a great weekend.

55:34.067 --> 55:35.034
I went to this wedding.

55:35.035 --> 55:36.795
You know actually, it
was a lot like "wedding

55:36.796 --> 55:39.072
crashers," but
meets "memento."

55:39.073 --> 55:40.872
That sounds like a good weekend

55:40.873 --> 55:42.633
yeah, it probably does sound
cool. Who knows?

55:42.634 --> 55:44.068
Or like, I don't know
how I was feeling, it was

55:44.069 --> 55:46.311
probably, probably how
Rachel felt when Ross was

55:46.312 --> 55:48.014
marrying that British girl.

55:48.015 --> 55:49.148
Well, time out.

55:49.149 --> 55:51.349
I'm pretty sure you just
admitted to watching "friends."

55:51.350 --> 55:53.086
Yes. You did. He did.

55:53.087 --> 55:55.822
There are Libyan refugees
who've seen "friends."

55:55.823 --> 55:59.158
Oh, I have never felt this
stoned in my whole life.

56:01.060 --> 56:01.728
Wow, okay.

56:01.729 --> 56:05.063
It's hot. It's hot. It's hot.

56:05.064 --> 56:06.666
It's hot in here.

56:06.667 --> 56:08.066
It's pot.

56:08.067 --> 56:09.267
It's pot?

56:09.268 --> 56:10.903
Oh, that's a funny joke.

56:10.904 --> 56:13.106
Well,

56:13.107 --> 56:13.872
whoa!

56:13.873 --> 56:15.108
Whoa, okay.

56:15.109 --> 56:16.949
Okay, that's a fun game
we're not going to play

56:16.950 --> 56:17.744
right now.

56:17.745 --> 56:19.112
Is this a joke?

56:19.113 --> 56:20.413
Are you my dad?

56:26.085 --> 56:27.253
Oh, that's me, sorry.

56:27.254 --> 56:28.894
Are you sure you want
to answer right now?

56:28.895 --> 56:30.923
<i>Maybe don't answer right now.</i>

56:30.924 --> 56:32.090
And she answers it.

56:32.091 --> 56:34.193
Uh huh?

56:34.194 --> 56:36.128
Tonight?

56:36.129 --> 56:37.430
Yeah, it's okay if..

56:37.431 --> 56:38.398
Could be important.

56:38.399 --> 56:39.999
No, of course I'm okay.

56:40.000 --> 56:40.433
Okay.

56:40.434 --> 56:41.401
Okay.

56:41.402 --> 56:44.205
Bye.

56:46.205 --> 56:47.439
Oh my God.

56:47.440 --> 56:48.307
<i>Hmm?</i>

56:48.308 --> 56:51.144
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

56:51.145 --> 56:53.179
Oh my God oh my God oh my God
oh my God oh my God oh my God.

56:53.180 --> 56:53.647
What is it?

56:53.648 --> 56:54.313
Are you alright?

56:54.314 --> 56:55.447
I'm so screwed.

56:55.448 --> 56:57.608
They just asked me to cover
the crisis hotline tonight.

56:57.609 --> 56:58.284
Now?

56:58.285 --> 56:59.251
Yeah.

56:59.252 --> 57:00.318
Wow.

57:00.319 --> 57:01.319
Can you say no?

57:02.221 --> 57:03.389
I can't breathe.

57:03.390 --> 57:05.324
No, I think you're
going to do a great job.

57:05.325 --> 57:07.726
<i>I agree, she is going
to knock 'em dead.</i>

57:07.727 --> 57:08.607
<i>Hey! That's not funny.</i>

57:08.608 --> 57:09.695
I can't breathe.

57:09.696 --> 57:10.996
That's a little funny.

57:10.997 --> 57:11.530
No it's going to be okay.

57:11.531 --> 57:12.411
It's going to be fine.

57:12.412 --> 57:13.965
No, it's not okay.

57:13.966 --> 57:19.805
No it's not okay, it's
not okay, it's not okay!

57:19.806 --> 57:21.173
Okay, hang on for a bit.

57:21.174 --> 57:22.842
Isaac, this is a big deal.

57:22.843 --> 57:23.876
People are going to die.

57:23.877 --> 57:25.343
They're not going to die.

57:25.344 --> 57:26.945
Hey, hey, Kate?

57:26.946 --> 57:28.914
So, I have some
Xanax in my purse.

57:28.915 --> 57:30.083
I'm going to go get it, okay?

57:30.084 --> 57:31.117
I have Klonopin right here.

57:31.118 --> 57:31.851
I've got one in my pocket.

57:31.852 --> 57:33.132
Yeah, but Xanax kicks in faster.

57:33.133 --> 57:34.186
Klonopin lasts longer.

57:34.187 --> 57:36.088
Which one do you prefer, Timmy?

57:36.089 --> 57:37.322
Timmy likes Klonopin.

57:37.323 --> 57:38.891
Well Xanax gives me a headache!

57:38.892 --> 57:40.026
It's going to be fine.

57:40.027 --> 57:41.347
It's... you're going to be
talking

57:41.348 --> 57:42.588
just like you're talking to me.

57:42.589 --> 57:44.096
<i>But Klonopin has a little more
bite!</i>

57:44.097 --> 57:48.133
Okay, so there you go,
and now you have the best

57:48.134 --> 57:51.037
anti-anxiety medicine
money can buy.

57:51.038 --> 57:53.171
That's debatable.

57:53.172 --> 57:53.892
Not helping. Stop.

57:53.893 --> 57:55.807
There we go. Let's get Upsies.

57:55.808 --> 57:56.508
Ohoho.

57:56.509 --> 57:57.443
<i>Ohh, alright!</i>

57:57.444 --> 57:58.878
Hey!

57:58.879 --> 57:59.912
<i>She's up!</i>

57:59.913 --> 58:01.180
Okay.

58:01.181 --> 58:02.481
Josh.

58:02.482 --> 58:02.983
What?

58:03.183 --> 58:04.816
When did you start taking meds?

58:04.817 --> 58:05.751
What?

58:05.752 --> 58:06.753
Prescription drugs.

58:06.754 --> 58:08.086
When did you start taking them?

58:08.087 --> 58:09.155
The Klonopin thing?

58:09.156 --> 58:09.856
Yeah.

58:09.857 --> 58:11.057
I don't want to talk about it.

58:11.058 --> 58:12.124
Why?

58:12.125 --> 58:14.327
Because I don't want
to talk about it.

58:14.328 --> 58:16.929
I'm just curious.

58:16.930 --> 58:18.331
I'm not judging.

58:18.332 --> 58:20.499
I went to a therapist
once, and I don't go

58:20.500 --> 58:21.434
anymore.

58:21.435 --> 58:22.769
And they gave me that.

58:22.770 --> 58:23.737
Just once?

58:23.738 --> 58:25.578
I started going when I
realized I was writing a

58:25.579 --> 58:28.039
dissertation that probably
no one in their right mind

58:28.040 --> 58:31.181
is ever going to read.

58:34.181 --> 58:35.414
Let's play a game.

58:35.415 --> 58:36.016
<i>Yeah.</i>

58:36.216 --> 58:37.983
<i>Yeah!</i>

58:37.984 --> 58:42.454
Alright, I actually have a game.

58:42.455 --> 58:44.157
Ready? Get out of there.

58:44.158 --> 58:45.925
<i>What are the rules, then?</i>

58:45.926 --> 58:47.827
Okay.

58:47.828 --> 58:48.795
Good question.

58:48.796 --> 58:52.130
The rules are that there
are no rules until you

58:52.131 --> 58:54.535
write them on a card.

58:55.535 --> 58:57.235
Okay, are we in?

58:57.236 --> 58:58.156
<i>Yeah, let's do it okay.</i>

58:58.157 --> 59:00.197
I'll go first.

59:05.078 --> 59:06.077
Okay.

59:06.078 --> 59:07.979
Everyone one must pat
their heads and rub their

59:07.980 --> 59:10.583
bellies before playing a
card, or they have to take

59:10.584 --> 59:11.584
a drink.

59:11.990 --> 59:12.990
What are we doing?

59:13.120 --> 59:15.988
Playing an imbecilic game.

59:15.989 --> 59:17.088
Sounds good, I'm in.

59:17.089 --> 59:18.259
Woo hoo!

59:19.259 --> 59:20.293
Okay.

59:20.294 --> 59:23.262
Okay, that's great, but
you have to rub your belly

59:23.263 --> 59:24.503
and pat your head before you...

59:24.504 --> 59:26.331
Can we stop saying belly?
It's...

59:26.332 --> 59:27.400
Belly. Rub it.

59:27.401 --> 59:30.570
Before you speak, you must
turn to the person on your

59:30.571 --> 59:32.938
left, introduce
yourself, then hug.

59:32.939 --> 59:34.840
Are you fucking kidding me?

59:34.841 --> 59:35.575
Come on big guy.

59:35.576 --> 59:36.510
Let's do this.

59:36.511 --> 59:38.443
Absolute... get the fuck,
get away from me.

59:38.444 --> 59:39.644
You didn't introduce yourself.

59:39.645 --> 59:40.565
You just read the card.

59:40.566 --> 59:42.380
You didn't introduce yourself.

59:42.381 --> 59:43.821
You didn't introduce
yourself either.

59:43.822 --> 59:44.822
That's fair, okay.

59:45.218 --> 59:46.985
Hello, my name is Sarah.

59:46.986 --> 59:48.887
It's really nice to meet
you, and now we are...

59:48.888 --> 59:49.921
<i>Okay, fine.</i>

59:49.922 --> 59:51.122
Hi, I'm Josh.

59:51.123 --> 59:54.428
This game is slowly
making me stupider.

59:55.428 --> 59:57.195
Okay, I'll do it.

59:57.196 --> 59:57.631
No, I got you.

59:57.632 --> 01:00:01.468
Hold on.

01:00:02.068 --> 01:00:02.268
Okay, first off, I have to..

01:00:02.468 --> 01:00:03.468
Yeah.

01:00:04.835 --> 01:00:05.678
Hi, how are you.

01:00:05.679 --> 01:00:12.478
Hello.

01:00:12.479 --> 01:00:13.613
Really?

01:00:13.614 --> 01:00:14.734
Yeah. It's part of the game.

01:00:14.735 --> 01:00:18.210
Why don't you read it?

01:00:22.022 --> 01:00:26.925
Um, suicide.

01:00:26.926 --> 01:00:30.662
Everyone take a turn and
explain what it means to you.

01:00:30.663 --> 01:00:31.597
Good job, man.

01:00:31.598 --> 01:00:34.076
Thank you.

01:00:43.076 --> 01:00:46.612
Uh, this card makes all of
Josh's rules invalid and

01:00:46.613 --> 01:00:48.046
can be played at any time.

01:00:48.047 --> 01:00:49.048
You can't do that.

01:00:49.049 --> 01:00:50.049
Just did.

01:00:50.216 --> 01:00:51.249
Sorry, the card says you
can play the card at any time.

01:00:51.250 --> 01:00:53.351
It goes against the
underlying architecture of

01:00:53.352 --> 01:00:56.155
the game of laying
cards and taking turns.

01:00:56.156 --> 01:00:58.590
For being all strict about it,
you didn't introduce yourself.

01:00:58.591 --> 01:01:00.626
Neither the fuck did you!

01:01:00.627 --> 01:01:01.526
Okay, Josh.

01:01:01.527 --> 01:01:03.162
Let's, uh, let's do that.

01:01:03.163 --> 01:01:04.664
But you, you start.

01:01:04.665 --> 01:01:05.497
Let's not.

01:01:05.498 --> 01:01:08.467
No no, let's do it.

01:01:08.468 --> 01:01:10.603
Okay.

01:01:10.604 --> 01:01:11.970
Yeah.

01:01:11.971 --> 01:01:14.639
I get sadness, okay?

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:16.575
I certainly get anxiety.

01:01:16.576 --> 01:01:17.675
I get depression.

01:01:17.676 --> 01:01:20.278
I'm pretty sure that I'm
experiencing one of those

01:01:20.279 --> 01:01:23.682
things at all times, but
what I don't understand

01:01:23.683 --> 01:01:25.985
is, Alex, is suicide,
because never once have I

01:01:25.986 --> 01:01:29.354
not been absolutely
terrified of my own death,

01:01:29.355 --> 01:01:32.191
and what that might do
to everyone around me.

01:01:32.192 --> 01:01:33.025
<i>I'm done.</i>

01:01:33.026 --> 01:01:34.546
I don't want to play
this game anymore.

01:01:34.547 --> 01:01:36.095
No, I think this is
a really good game.

01:01:36.096 --> 01:01:38.264
We've been dancing around
the main point of this

01:01:38.265 --> 01:01:40.700
trip all weekend.

01:01:40.701 --> 01:01:43.135
I mean Jesus Christ.

01:01:43.136 --> 01:01:45.503
Nobody would even talk
about the downstairs

01:01:45.504 --> 01:01:47.273
bathroom, let alone walk
in there.

01:01:47.274 --> 01:01:48.474
Alex, I've been in there.

01:01:48.475 --> 01:01:49.976
It's a fucking mess.

01:01:49.977 --> 01:01:51.443
So let's open that door.

01:01:51.444 --> 01:01:53.979
Literally, metaphorically,
pardon the pun.

01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:55.146
Josh, stop.

01:01:55.147 --> 01:01:57.450
Sarah, please shut up.

01:01:57.451 --> 01:01:59.517
I think Alex should,
should give it to us

01:01:59.518 --> 01:02:00.720
straight here.

01:02:00.721 --> 01:02:01.820
You know?

01:02:01.821 --> 01:02:04.657
Tell us all what a good
job we all did of fucking

01:02:04.658 --> 01:02:06.392
him up when he was down.

01:02:06.393 --> 01:02:09.061
How we all noticed his
increasingly erratic

01:02:09.062 --> 01:02:12.030
tweets and status updates,
and how we all thought

01:02:12.031 --> 01:02:13.716
enough to do something about it.

01:02:14.201 --> 01:02:14.701
Alright.

01:02:14.768 --> 01:02:15.735
Sarah...

01:02:15.736 --> 01:02:17.702
Let her go, she'll be fine.

01:02:17.703 --> 01:02:19.338
You're a piece of
shit, you know that?

01:02:19.339 --> 01:02:20.773
I'm a truth teller.

01:02:20.774 --> 01:02:23.742
Alex has been saying some,
no offense, you've been

01:02:23.743 --> 01:02:25.410
saying some weird
stuff for a while.

01:02:25.411 --> 01:02:29.115
And you can't
blame us for not...

01:02:29.116 --> 01:02:31.076
Being able to see that
there was a bigger problem.

01:02:31.077 --> 01:02:32.418
Some weird stuff?

01:02:32.419 --> 01:02:34.285
I'm sorry, what was it
exactly Alex, that it...

01:02:34.286 --> 01:02:35.487
Does anybody remember?

01:02:35.488 --> 01:02:40.092
"Ask for me tomorrow and
you shall find me a grave man?"

01:02:40.093 --> 01:02:42.360
Lot of ambiguity in that one.

01:02:42.361 --> 01:02:43.461
Where the fuck were you?

01:02:43.462 --> 01:02:44.102
That's my point?

01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:45.697
Where the fuck were any of us?

01:02:45.698 --> 01:02:51.406
Okay, okay, um...

01:02:52.406 --> 01:02:54.773
Alex called me a lot that day.

01:02:54.774 --> 01:02:59.644
He called me a lot
that week, and uh...

01:02:59.645 --> 01:03:02.514
And I didn't answer.

01:03:02.515 --> 01:03:09.789
I didn't answer even though I
knew he wasn't doing well.

01:03:09.790 --> 01:03:14.726
The truth is, none of this
would've happened if I

01:03:14.727 --> 01:03:19.298
would've been a better
friend to my friend.

01:03:19.299 --> 01:03:20.231
No...

01:03:20.232 --> 01:03:22.233
So, this one's on me.

01:03:22.234 --> 01:03:23.550
No it's not, Ben, please.

01:03:24.203 --> 01:03:28.340
No. It's not, I mean, I...

01:03:28.341 --> 01:03:32.144
Yeah, I, I was upset that
you were not answering my

01:03:32.145 --> 01:03:37.115
calls, but I...

01:03:37.116 --> 01:03:42.755
I didn't want to die.

01:03:42.756 --> 01:03:45.657
What?

01:03:45.658 --> 01:03:48.461
Well, I, know, I mean, I...

01:03:48.462 --> 01:03:51.563
I thought I, I
thought I did. I did. I...

01:03:51.564 --> 01:03:53.499
If you didn't want
to die then, w...

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:56.468
I did, but then I, I
changed my mind, and I

01:03:56.469 --> 01:04:00.271
called the hospital
myself, and... you know,

01:04:00.272 --> 01:04:03.541
I, I think...

01:04:03.542 --> 01:04:08.216
I, I really think that I
just wanted to, you know,

01:04:09.216 --> 01:04:11.819
to see you, and...

01:04:13.819 --> 01:04:15.488
You wanted to see me?

01:04:15.489 --> 01:04:17.755
Well yeah, I mean, no,
but, you, and everyone.

01:04:17.756 --> 01:04:18.724
Right right, everyone.

01:04:18.725 --> 01:04:19.724
Right.

01:04:19.725 --> 01:04:21.459
You wanted to see
everyone, so you slit your

01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:24.863
wrists, but not enough so
you would die, but..

01:04:24.864 --> 01:04:27.266
I'm not saying that it makes
sense, I'm...

01:04:27.267 --> 01:04:29.501
You're right, it makes
absolutely no sense, Alex.

01:04:29.502 --> 01:04:31.403
It makes no fucking sense.

01:04:31.404 --> 01:04:35.141
Do you have any idea what
I've been going through?

01:04:35.142 --> 01:04:36.542
What I've been
thinking and feeling?

01:04:36.543 --> 01:04:37.809
- Yes, yes I do. I do.
- You do?

01:04:37.810 --> 01:04:38.970
- Please tell me-
- I'm sorry.

01:04:38.971 --> 01:04:39.811
Oh you're sorry?

01:04:39.812 --> 01:04:41.313
I was trying to get
in touch with you.

01:04:41.314 --> 01:04:41.994
I have a job man!

01:04:42.181 --> 01:04:43.314
Fucking duties!

01:04:43.315 --> 01:04:44.249
I have a fucking deadline!

01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:45.284
Oh yeah, you were so busy?

01:04:45.285 --> 01:04:46.418
I have a fucking job! Yes I was
fucking busy!

01:04:46.419 --> 01:04:48.499
When you were writing your
book that you haven't been

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.155
writing for a year?

01:04:50.156 --> 01:04:51.916
Is that what you were
doing that you couldn't

01:04:51.917 --> 01:04:54.267
answer the phone one time?

01:05:07.841 --> 01:05:09.216
Ben...

01:05:16.216 --> 01:05:18.184
Hey.

01:05:18.185 --> 01:05:19.185
Hey, Sarah, come here.

01:05:19.218 --> 01:05:20.853
What?

01:05:20.854 --> 01:05:21.820
Look at me.

01:05:21.821 --> 01:05:23.255
Look at me.

01:05:23.256 --> 01:05:24.956
Sarah...

01:05:24.957 --> 01:05:28.526
I'm sorry, okay?

01:05:28.527 --> 01:05:31.496
Sometimes things,
they need to be said.

01:05:31.497 --> 01:05:38.906
And in those instances,
being an asshole comes in handy.

01:05:39.906 --> 01:05:44.946
You okay?

01:05:45.946 --> 01:05:47.246
Stop.

01:05:47.247 --> 01:05:49.881
What?

01:05:49.882 --> 01:05:51.650
Josh, stop.

01:05:51.651 --> 01:05:54.420
Seriously.

01:05:54.421 --> 01:05:56.488
Come on.

01:05:56.489 --> 01:05:58.324
All that talk about death?

01:05:58.325 --> 01:06:00.492
Eugh.

01:06:00.493 --> 01:06:04.998
Tell me you don't want to.

01:06:05.998 --> 01:06:07.666
No, stop.

01:06:07.667 --> 01:06:09.568
What?

01:06:09.569 --> 01:06:10.735
You know what I want?

01:06:10.736 --> 01:06:14.907
I want you to have acted
like my boyfriend 7 years ago.

01:06:14.908 --> 01:06:18.510
Taken me to a movie, bought
me a fucking ice cream cone.

01:06:18.511 --> 01:06:20.378
That's what I want.

01:06:20.379 --> 01:06:22.947
Instead of being the guy
who permanently fucked up

01:06:22.948 --> 01:06:26.452
my expectations
for normalcy in a relationship.

01:06:26.453 --> 01:06:28.820
The guy that made me
explain to my mom that

01:06:28.821 --> 01:06:31.724
"no, Josh isn't exactly
my boyfriend, he is just

01:06:31.725 --> 01:06:34.892
someone who sleeps with me
when he comes home pining

01:06:34.893 --> 01:06:37.899
for my best friend, too
drunk to see straight."

01:06:39.899 --> 01:06:41.867
Sarah, I was 20.

01:06:41.868 --> 01:06:44.637
So was I.

01:06:44.638 --> 01:06:45.771
I...

01:06:45.772 --> 01:06:48.974
My dad had just left my mom.

01:06:48.975 --> 01:06:50.709
Is that your excuse?

01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:52.744
I was angry.

01:06:52.745 --> 01:06:54.412
Okay?

01:06:54.413 --> 01:06:55.514
I was angry.

01:06:55.515 --> 01:07:01.725
I was angry at my dad, I
was angry at fucking Ben.

01:07:05.725 --> 01:07:11.350
What, you didn't even see
what you were doing to me?

01:07:30.350 --> 01:07:31.988
One minute.

01:07:46.665 --> 01:07:48.599
<i>What's your name?</i>

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:50.436
<i>Amber?</i>

01:07:50.437 --> 01:07:52.671
<i>Wow, that's a pretty name.</i>

01:07:52.672 --> 01:07:56.909
<i>How old are you?</i>

01:07:56.910 --> 01:07:58.543
What's up?

01:07:58.544 --> 01:08:04.016
What's going on?

01:08:04.017 --> 01:08:07.452
Man, I'm sorry about that Amber.

01:08:07.453 --> 01:08:12.490
That's tough to feel like
you've finally found that

01:08:12.491 --> 01:08:16.828
person, the right
person for you and...

01:08:16.830 --> 01:08:18.901
They don't feel the same.

01:08:21.901 --> 01:08:23.402
Mm.

01:08:23.403 --> 01:08:25.837
Hey, Amber, Amber, Amber.

01:08:25.839 --> 01:08:30.509
Most people I know, most
people in the world,

01:08:30.510 --> 01:08:34.112
they're actually really afraid
to feel what you're feeling.

01:08:34.113 --> 01:08:36.749
They won't even let themselves.

01:08:36.750 --> 01:08:39.585
But you, you're...

01:08:39.586 --> 01:08:42.086
You're willing to go there.

01:08:42.087 --> 01:08:48.926
And to me, that means
that you're very brave.

01:08:48.928 --> 01:08:50.728
And...

01:08:50.729 --> 01:08:55.715
To me that means that you
are going to be just fine.

01:09:09.715 --> 01:09:12.917
Hey.

01:09:12.919 --> 01:09:13.919
<i>Hi.</i>

01:09:16.589 --> 01:09:17.589
Hi.

01:09:20.426 --> 01:09:23.528
Will you pinch me again?

01:09:23.529 --> 01:09:26.598
What?

01:09:26.599 --> 01:09:33.504
On why you want to try?

01:09:33.505 --> 01:09:36.107
I want to.

01:09:36.108 --> 01:09:37.215
I'm ready.

01:09:43.215 --> 01:09:46.220
I know.

01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:51.089
Tell me more.

01:09:51.090 --> 01:09:54.793
I just need reasons.

01:09:54.794 --> 01:09:57.595
Why?

01:09:57.596 --> 01:10:02.835
Because it turns
out that I'm not.

01:10:02.836 --> 01:10:06.671
It turns out it
was a false alarm.

01:10:06.672 --> 01:10:09.540
I guess I was just worried
that maybe you got caught up in

01:10:09.541 --> 01:10:11.381
the moment and said some
things that you didn't

01:10:11.581 --> 01:10:13.501
really mean, and maybe
someday you'd regret them,

01:10:13.502 --> 01:10:14.879
so...

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:17.785
I just...

01:10:18.785 --> 01:10:21.253
Ben...

01:10:21.254 --> 01:10:23.688
Please say something.

01:10:23.689 --> 01:10:26.926
I don't, I don't know.

01:10:27.926 --> 01:10:32.134
It's not like I was
lying back there.

01:10:35.134 --> 01:10:37.068
Um, maybe you're right.

01:10:37.069 --> 01:10:39.279
Maybe...

01:10:47.279 --> 01:10:48.279
What?

01:10:50.215 --> 01:10:53.184
Really?

01:10:53.185 --> 01:10:57.188
I push you that
much and you fold?

01:10:57.189 --> 01:10:58.189
You're not even fighting me.

01:10:58.190 --> 01:10:59.230
I don't know what it is...

01:10:59.231 --> 01:11:00.671
Come on please,
don't, don't do that.

01:11:00.672 --> 01:11:02.760
You always pretend like
you're the one that's all

01:11:02.761 --> 01:11:05.296
in, when you know like I
know if I was writing, if

01:11:05.297 --> 01:11:08.066
I was on, we wouldn't even
be having this conversation.

01:11:08.067 --> 01:11:09.547
You wouldn't even
be opting out of our

01:11:09.548 --> 01:11:12.271
relationship and flying
across the country to LA...

01:11:12.272 --> 01:11:14.071
- Wherever the
- can you even hear yourself?

01:11:14.072 --> 01:11:15.840
This wouldn't
be happening. You know...

01:11:15.841 --> 01:11:18.210
Do you really think
that's what this is about?

01:11:18.810 --> 01:11:20.044
This is not about you.

01:11:20.045 --> 01:11:21.847
This has nothing to
do with your writing.

01:11:21.848 --> 01:11:23.488
This has everything
to do with my writing.

01:11:23.489 --> 01:11:26.466
It's always had everything
to do with my writing.

01:11:49.142 --> 01:11:50.843
Busted.

01:11:54.647 --> 01:11:56.915
That was a dramatic night.

01:11:56.916 --> 01:11:59.084
Yeah.

01:11:59.085 --> 01:12:00.619
I was serious about
dinner, by the way.

01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:01.719
It was so good.

01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:03.589
Oh, thank you.

01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:04.389
Shut up.

01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:06.592
You should open
your own restaurant.

01:12:06.593 --> 01:12:09.327
Yeah, can you imagine that
conversation with my parents?

01:12:09.328 --> 01:12:13.264
Fuck it. Do it anyway.

01:12:13.265 --> 01:12:18.037
So what, you just give
up on what you want?

01:12:19.037 --> 01:12:20.879
Who says that's what I want?

01:12:28.781 --> 01:12:32.049
Okay, it's what I want.

01:12:32.050 --> 01:12:32.985
You happy?

01:12:32.986 --> 01:12:34.991
Yeah, I totally am.

01:12:37.991 --> 01:12:39.357
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:12:39.358 --> 01:12:40.925
I'm sorry.

01:12:40.926 --> 01:12:42.126
No no, it's okay.

01:12:42.127 --> 01:12:44.896
I'm sorry.

01:12:44.897 --> 01:12:47.064
Hey, don't take that
personally, okay?

01:12:47.065 --> 01:12:49.101
- It's kind okay.
- Of like...

01:12:49.102 --> 01:12:51.103
A new policy of
mine, apparently.

01:12:51.104 --> 01:12:52.104
What's that mean?

01:12:52.205 --> 01:12:54.673
Um, I just did the
same thing to Josh.

01:12:54.674 --> 01:12:55.906
Oh, great.

01:12:55.907 --> 01:12:57.778
Great.

01:12:58.778 --> 01:12:59.878
Isaac, I'm, come on.

01:12:59.879 --> 01:13:02.181
I didn't mean it like that.

01:13:03.181 --> 01:13:04.049
I'm sorry.

01:13:04.050 --> 01:13:04.930
That was embarrassing.

01:13:04.931 --> 01:13:06.299
I thought that's
what you wanted.

01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:07.853
No, I did.

01:13:07.854 --> 01:13:09.086
I do, believe me.

01:13:09.087 --> 01:13:10.155
Apparently not anymore.

01:13:10.156 --> 01:13:12.156
Well, for a long
time I did want that.

01:13:12.157 --> 01:13:13.227
Okay.

01:13:14.227 --> 01:13:15.227
But...

01:13:16.328 --> 01:13:17.328
But...

01:13:18.730 --> 01:13:20.667
But that's, it's
not what you want.

01:13:21.325 --> 01:13:22.747
You don't know what I want.

01:13:22.748 --> 01:13:24.268
I-Isaac, you
don't want this.

01:13:24.269 --> 01:13:27.408
Your 19 year-old
self wants this.

01:13:29.408 --> 01:13:31.108
You want closure.

01:13:31.109 --> 01:13:35.013
You want...

01:13:35.014 --> 01:13:41.719
I think you're afraid that this
thing with Kate might be real,

01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:43.823
you think it could be real.

01:13:44.823 --> 01:13:46.232
Sarah...

01:13:53.232 --> 01:13:54.465
How did it go?

01:13:54.466 --> 01:13:56.735
I don't think I have
any blood on my hands.

01:13:56.736 --> 01:13:57.702
That's great.

01:13:57.703 --> 01:13:58.703
That's good.

01:14:08.246 --> 01:14:09.246
Hey.

01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:11.795
Hey.

01:14:23.795 --> 01:14:26.430
You've been quiet all weekend.

01:14:26.431 --> 01:14:31.068
Everyone likes talking
more than listening.

01:14:31.069 --> 01:14:32.937
Sometimes I just
get tired of it.

01:14:32.938 --> 01:14:34.839
I prefer the opposite.

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:38.242
Well, if that, that is not
a rare quality, I don't

01:14:38.243 --> 01:14:39.348
know what is.

01:14:42.348 --> 01:14:44.750
Ben didn't mean it.

01:14:44.751 --> 01:14:48.786
What he said to you.

01:14:48.787 --> 01:14:50.821
It's okay, I, I...

01:14:50.822 --> 01:14:53.959
No it's not.

01:14:53.960 --> 01:15:00.064
It's not okay, what they did.

01:15:00.065 --> 01:15:02.546
It's not okay what I did either.

01:15:14.546 --> 01:15:18.383
Can I see?

01:15:18.384 --> 01:15:21.919
Why?

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:24.421
I don't know.

01:15:24.422 --> 01:15:26.058
Okay.

01:15:59.058 --> 01:16:05.886
You know we both
have to let it go.

01:16:27.886 --> 01:16:29.223
Where you been?

01:16:30.223 --> 01:16:35.629
Oh, attempting to
have sex with Sarah.

01:16:36.629 --> 01:16:38.530
Good for her for
turning you down.

01:16:38.531 --> 01:16:43.142
Heh, thank you.

01:16:50.142 --> 01:16:53.544
You know, I can't remember
what happened last.

01:16:53.545 --> 01:16:58.456
Me writing something good
or me and Siri having sex.

01:17:03.056 --> 01:17:05.423
So basically what you're
saying is that you're

01:17:05.424 --> 01:17:08.660
blocked in more ways than one.

01:17:08.661 --> 01:17:11.466
Yeah, that's one way to put it.

01:17:14.466 --> 01:17:19.271
To think that I've been
jealous of you for 7 years.

01:17:19.272 --> 01:17:21.510
Hm.

01:17:24.510 --> 01:17:27.178
Looks like someone
made a friend.

01:17:27.179 --> 01:17:32.153
He's the only one
that understands me.

01:17:34.153 --> 01:17:35.954
What happened to everyone?

01:17:35.955 --> 01:17:37.621
Isaac and Kate went to bed.

01:17:37.622 --> 01:17:41.492
I guess Siri did too.

01:17:41.493 --> 01:17:43.260
And what about Alex.

01:17:43.261 --> 01:17:47.710
I thought he was with you.

01:17:57.710 --> 01:18:00.178
<i>Ben, wait wait wait.</i>

01:18:00.179 --> 01:18:03.080
<i>Ben...</i>

01:18:03.081 --> 01:18:04.584
Hey, did you find him?

01:18:05.584 --> 01:18:07.384
Ben.

01:18:07.385 --> 01:18:09.053
Ben!

01:18:09.054 --> 01:18:10.287
What's going on?

01:18:10.288 --> 01:18:12.357
Wait, wait, wait,
Ben, Ben, Ben Ben.

01:18:12.358 --> 01:18:13.458
Please, please, please.

01:18:13.459 --> 01:18:14.358
Just let me...

01:18:14.359 --> 01:18:15.999
What can you possibly
say to me right now?

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.461
That I, I love you.

01:18:17.462 --> 01:18:18.495
I really I do, more than
anyone in the world.

01:18:18.496 --> 01:18:19.563
Fuck you!

01:18:19.564 --> 01:18:21.398
Please-oh!

01:18:21.399 --> 01:18:22.742
Ow!

01:18:29.742 --> 01:18:31.076
Wait, Ben Ben Ben.

01:18:31.077 --> 01:18:35.312
Ben, please, please,
I'm sorry, okay, no!

01:18:35.313 --> 01:18:36.313
Ben!

01:18:36.314 --> 01:18:39.152
Ben!

01:18:40.152 --> 01:18:42.286
Where are your keys!

01:18:42.287 --> 01:18:44.656
Sarah, where are your keys?

01:18:44.657 --> 01:18:48.759
I gave them to Ben.

01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:49.560
<i>The fuck's going on?</i>

01:18:49.561 --> 01:18:50.629
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:52.997
<i>I don't know. Everybody's
getting together with everybody.</i>

01:18:52.998 --> 01:18:57.634
♪ I heard it was
a real good time ♪

01:18:57.635 --> 01:18:59.036
♪ I heard it was... ♪

01:18:59.037 --> 01:19:00.572
Fuck!

01:19:09.581 --> 01:19:11.349
Shit!

01:20:46.879 --> 01:20:51.683
<i>Judgment has a way of creeping
into every relationship.</i>

01:20:51.684 --> 01:20:55.687
<i>Even the most intimate.</i>

<i>We call those

01:22:09.795 --> 01:22:12.897
Nice shiner.

01:22:12.898 --> 01:22:16.800
Nice driving.

01:22:16.801 --> 01:22:18.937
What are you doing?

01:22:18.938 --> 01:22:20.215
Writing.

01:22:29.215 --> 01:22:37.621
Um, I'm uh, I'm a
little fucked up.

01:22:37.622 --> 01:22:40.758
No shit?

01:22:40.759 --> 01:22:45.662
Can I play that card now?

01:22:45.663 --> 01:22:48.305
Sure.

01:22:54.305 --> 01:23:00.844
I um...

01:23:00.845 --> 01:23:05.983
I know that uh...

01:23:05.984 --> 01:23:06.951
That it's UN...

01:23:06.952 --> 01:23:11.255
Unhealthy to...

01:23:11.256 --> 01:23:14.625
To need, um...

01:23:14.626 --> 01:23:18.295
T-just too much from
people, and I've been

01:23:18.296 --> 01:23:21.598
working really hard on...

01:23:21.599 --> 01:23:24.602
On, on trying to like...

01:23:24.603 --> 01:23:31.041
Set up healthy, uh...

01:23:31.042 --> 01:23:33.510
Ways of...

01:23:33.511 --> 01:23:37.447
Communicating and...

01:23:37.448 --> 01:23:39.717
I don't, I don't know,
I don't know why.

01:23:39.718 --> 01:23:41.619
Hey, the world's got
enough people you've gotta

01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:43.703
explain yourself to, right?

01:23:58.703 --> 01:24:02.752
Tell me if that's shit or not.

01:24:14.752 --> 01:24:17.754
Thanks for last
night, by the way.

01:24:17.755 --> 01:24:18.689
For what?

01:24:18.690 --> 01:24:21.959
For rebuffing me.

01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:24.394
Hey, what are friends for.

01:24:24.395 --> 01:24:26.763
I've been thinking a lot this
morning about investment.

01:24:26.764 --> 01:24:28.366
Yeah, that's not
weird or anything.

01:24:28.367 --> 01:24:29.007
No, I'm serious.

01:24:29.135 --> 01:24:32.003
I think you should
open your place.

01:24:32.004 --> 01:24:33.244
Eh, that's not going to happen.

01:24:33.245 --> 01:24:35.505
What if I helped you get
on your feet, get set up,

01:24:35.506 --> 01:24:39.576
get a little seed
money or something?

01:24:39.577 --> 01:24:42.979
Okay, I don't need
anything from you.

01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:44.848
I don't need help
or a favor or...

01:24:44.849 --> 01:24:46.409
It wouldn't be a
favor, it'd be selfish.

01:24:46.410 --> 01:24:49.387
I'd be making money off of you.

01:24:49.388 --> 01:24:50.588
You're not being serious.

01:24:50.589 --> 01:24:52.022
I'm totally serious.

01:24:52.023 --> 01:24:54.058
Believe it or not, I'm a
pretty savvy businessman.

01:24:54.059 --> 01:24:55.960
I know, but...

01:24:55.961 --> 01:24:57.321
But what? Come on,
think about it.

01:24:57.322 --> 01:25:06.737
Small place, lower east side,
12 tables, food from upstate.

01:25:06.738 --> 01:25:09.973
Well, naturally the food
would have to be from upstate.

01:25:09.974 --> 01:25:12.509
The dishes would be a
tasteful nod to the area's

01:25:12.510 --> 01:25:15.812
fading Jewish and
Chinese denizens.

01:25:15.813 --> 01:25:16.580
That's perfect.

01:25:16.581 --> 01:25:18.516
Like uh, egg drop
matzo ball soup?

01:25:18.517 --> 01:25:20.418
Yeah.

01:25:20.419 --> 01:25:21.986
Szechuan brisket.

01:25:21.987 --> 01:25:23.888
Got sweet and sour Kugel.

01:25:23.889 --> 01:25:24.856
Mm.

01:25:24.857 --> 01:25:26.089
Kung Pao...

01:25:26.090 --> 01:25:27.825
Latkes?

01:25:27.826 --> 01:25:29.626
Mm. That sounds really good.

01:25:29.627 --> 01:25:30.527
That sounds terrible.

01:25:30.528 --> 01:25:32.996
That does sound terrible.

01:25:32.997 --> 01:25:35.165
What do you say?

01:25:35.166 --> 01:25:39.072
Shake on it?

01:25:40.672 --> 01:25:42.792
<i>Hey, you've reached Ben Kaplan's
cell phone.</i>

01:25:42.793 --> 01:25:45.465
<i>Leave a message
and I'll get back to you.</i>

01:25:47.446 --> 01:25:50.915
He's just blowing off steam.

01:25:50.916 --> 01:25:53.017
Josh, I really fucked up.

01:25:53.018 --> 01:25:55.486
I know.

01:25:55.487 --> 01:25:57.955
He'll get past it.

01:25:57.956 --> 01:26:00.090
It's ironic, though.

01:26:00.091 --> 01:26:01.793
Why?

01:26:01.794 --> 01:26:03.754
I just thought that if you
were ever going to slip

01:26:03.755 --> 01:26:06.691
up, it would be with me.

01:26:27.486 --> 01:26:28.585
Thanks for the ride.

01:26:28.586 --> 01:26:30.888
Yeah.

01:26:30.889 --> 01:26:33.191
So you'll, you'll
consider the offer?

01:26:33.192 --> 01:26:36.594
Yeah, absolutely.

01:26:36.595 --> 01:26:40.697
It's really fucking
good, you know?

01:26:40.698 --> 01:26:44.002
Quite an auspicious start.

01:26:45.002 --> 01:26:48.772
I guess I have you to
thank for that also.

01:26:48.773 --> 01:26:51.920
Well...

01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:02.820
Good dog!

01:27:02.821 --> 01:27:05.760
Hey Timmy.

01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:10.928
Thanks guys.

01:27:10.929 --> 01:27:12.897
Happy I passed on the insurance.

01:27:12.898 --> 01:27:16.867
Tell them it was an elk.

01:27:16.868 --> 01:27:19.070
In the shape of a tree?

01:27:19.071 --> 01:27:22.841
It jumped out like an elk.

01:27:23.841 --> 01:27:25.282
<i>He really can't drive.</i>

01:27:30.282 --> 01:27:32.782
Alex, you got any crazy
glue in the house?

01:27:32.783 --> 01:27:35.058
<i>You won't even notice.</i>

01:27:40.058 --> 01:27:42.559
So, do you hate me?

01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:43.827
No.

01:27:43.828 --> 01:27:46.902
I could never do that.

01:27:49.902 --> 01:27:53.005
Are you sure?

01:27:54.005 --> 01:27:55.272
Yeah.

01:27:55.273 --> 01:27:57.176
I'm sure.

01:28:01.713 --> 01:28:03.873
You know, I couldn't
believe my luck freshman

01:28:03.874 --> 01:28:07.117
year when I found out your
place was across the hall.

01:28:07.118 --> 01:28:11.621
Then when we actually
spoke, it was like I

01:28:11.622 --> 01:28:14.892
wanted to throw away all
ideas of dumb luck and

01:28:14.893 --> 01:28:18.963
start invoking God and
fate and a bunch of other

01:28:18.964 --> 01:28:19.964
capitalized words.

01:28:20.232 --> 01:28:22.232
Ben why are you
saying this right now?

01:28:22.233 --> 01:28:24.193
'Cause when good things
happen, you always want to

01:28:24.194 --> 01:28:29.068
imagine them as fated.

01:28:29.942 --> 01:28:33.777
And when bad things happen, of
course the world's this

01:28:33.778 --> 01:28:40.151
cold and brutally random place.

01:28:40.152 --> 01:28:42.986
I'm scared of what the
world'd look like without you.

01:28:42.987 --> 01:28:47.625
You can't stay with me
because you're scared.

01:28:47.626 --> 01:28:49.263
You're right.

01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:58.736
How was that for an
introduction to my friends?

01:28:58.737 --> 01:29:02.674
A bigger disaster than I
could possibly imagine.

01:29:04.376 --> 01:29:06.978
You're telling me.

01:29:06.979 --> 01:29:09.112
Now you're going to dump
me as soon as we're not

01:29:09.113 --> 01:29:12.049
stuck together at 30,000 feet.

01:29:12.050 --> 01:29:14.151
What are you talking about?

01:29:14.152 --> 01:29:15.752
What do you mean what
am I talking about.

01:29:15.753 --> 01:29:16.819
You just said it yourself.

01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:17.820
I'm...

01:29:18.223 --> 01:29:20.357
I've made a total
fool of myself.

01:29:20.358 --> 01:29:22.192
Baby, my friends
are the disaster.

01:29:22.193 --> 01:29:23.893
You're amazing.

01:29:23.894 --> 01:29:24.794
That's not true.

01:29:24.795 --> 01:29:25.795
That's totally true.

01:29:25.796 --> 01:29:28.667
You're the only sane
person here and you know it.

01:29:29.667 --> 01:29:31.072
Hey.

01:29:35.072 --> 01:29:36.388
I'm really glad you came.

01:29:39.277 --> 01:29:40.844
You ready to meet my parents?

01:29:40.845 --> 01:29:43.848
I don't think so.

01:29:43.849 --> 01:29:46.282
I don't blame you. They're
fucking crazy.

01:29:46.283 --> 01:29:49.157
Good Timmy.

01:29:52.157 --> 01:29:56.727
So, we are all doomed,
romantically speaking.

01:29:56.728 --> 01:29:59.930
Only on like a
deep karmic level.

01:30:01.233 --> 01:30:03.812
For whatever reason, I'm
strangely okay with that.

01:30:05.269 --> 01:30:06.437
- Yeah?
- What?

01:30:06.438 --> 01:30:09.406
Maybe I'm turning
over a new leaf.

01:30:09.407 --> 01:30:11.287
Maybe we should make one
of those pacts where if

01:30:11.288 --> 01:30:15.912
we're still single when we're
35, we all just get married.

01:30:15.913 --> 01:30:16.914
Who, the three of us?

01:30:16.915 --> 01:30:20.017
Yes, and Timmy of course.

01:30:20.018 --> 01:30:22.820
We'll make a great
dysfunctional family.

01:30:22.821 --> 01:30:23.821
How's that sound Timmy?

01:30:23.822 --> 01:30:26.093
I'd consider it.

01:30:28.093 --> 01:30:29.893
Oh, hey, you going so soon?

01:30:29.894 --> 01:30:31.696
<i>Flight to catch.</i>

01:30:31.697 --> 01:30:33.337
We'll see if I can
rustle up Ben and Siri.

01:30:33.338 --> 01:30:35.031
Thanks for coming, man.

01:30:35.032 --> 01:30:35.967
See you soon, I hear?

01:30:35.968 --> 01:30:37.735
Yeah, hopefully at
the end of the month.

01:30:37.736 --> 01:30:38.869
I'm excited.

01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:39.969
What does that mean?

01:30:39.970 --> 01:30:41.890
Alex asked if there was
any openings at the place

01:30:41.891 --> 01:30:43.558
I work, and I told
him there was a strong

01:30:43.559 --> 01:30:46.009
likelihood I could
get him a job.

01:30:46.010 --> 01:30:47.745
That's awesome.

01:30:47.746 --> 01:30:48.713
Congratulations.

01:30:48.714 --> 01:30:50.080
Thanks.

01:30:50.081 --> 01:30:52.383
I think I have a strong resume.

01:30:52.384 --> 01:30:54.485
Is that a suicide joke?

01:30:54.486 --> 01:30:55.487
Too soon.

01:31:05.229 --> 01:31:07.298
I'm going to miss you guys.

01:31:07.299 --> 01:31:07.932
Not me.

01:31:08.132 --> 01:31:10.334
I'll be checking
on my investment.

01:31:10.335 --> 01:31:12.036
Ha, what investment?

01:31:12.037 --> 01:31:13.303
Sarah's opening a restaurant.

01:31:13.304 --> 01:31:15.004
- No I'm not.
- Is.

01:31:15.005 --> 01:31:16.439
- No, what?
- He's...

01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:17.374
Crazy.

01:31:17.375 --> 01:31:18.010
<i>Sarah.</i>

01:31:18.210 --> 01:31:19.210
What?

01:31:19.211 --> 01:31:21.091
Take the money before he
gets an even worse idea

01:31:21.092 --> 01:31:22.963
what to do with it.

01:31:25.916 --> 01:31:27.220
Where's your stuff?

01:31:28.220 --> 01:31:30.787
Yeah, about that.

01:31:30.788 --> 01:31:32.156
I uh...

01:31:32.157 --> 01:31:33.790
I think I'm hanging
around a while.

01:31:33.791 --> 01:31:36.393
Seems like Ben got a good
idea for a story last

01:31:36.394 --> 01:31:40.263
night and, so I told him
he should stay and write.

01:31:40.264 --> 01:31:41.965
So staying was an option?

01:31:41.966 --> 01:31:43.000
You, you could stay.

01:31:43.001 --> 01:31:43.867
I don't want to stay.

01:31:43.868 --> 01:31:44.501
You want to stay?

01:31:44.502 --> 01:31:45.503
No, I don't want to stay.

01:31:45.504 --> 01:31:47.224
I'm sorry, can we take
a group photo please?

01:31:47.225 --> 01:31:47.972
Yes.

01:31:47.973 --> 01:31:48.505
I thought, I thought
we talked about this.

01:31:48.506 --> 01:31:50.174
I know, but please.

01:31:50.175 --> 01:31:52.442
You've got time for
exactly one photo.

01:31:52.443 --> 01:31:53.376
Here, I'll take it.

01:31:53.377 --> 01:31:54.245
Thank you Kate.

01:31:54.246 --> 01:31:55.345
Thank you.

01:31:55.346 --> 01:31:56.506
<i>The car is dying to be in it.</i>

01:31:56.507 --> 01:31:58.148
<i>We have to.</i>

01:31:58.149 --> 01:32:00.029
<i>Yeah, and don't forget
to get my shoes in baby.</i>

01:32:00.030 --> 01:32:00.951
<i>Oho, please.</i>

01:32:00.952 --> 01:32:02.519
<i>Frame up for the shoes, please.</i>

01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:04.402
<i>It's the most important part.</i>

01:32:17.402 --> 01:32:18.335
Alex, right?

01:32:18.336 --> 01:32:19.402
Yeah.

01:32:19.403 --> 01:32:20.877
You can join us if you want.

01:32:21.206 --> 01:32:23.879
Oh, cool thanks.

01:32:27.879 --> 01:32:30.513
I send you on a mission
for sugar, you bring back

01:32:30.514 --> 01:32:32.049
a lost boy.

01:32:32.050 --> 01:32:33.150
Hey man, I'm Josh.

01:32:33.151 --> 01:32:35.318
Hey, Alex.

01:32:35.319 --> 01:32:37.287
Um, I don't think we met. I'm
Ben.

01:32:37.288 --> 01:32:37.922
Siri.

01:32:38.122 --> 01:32:38.688
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:32:38.689 --> 01:32:39.956
Ben, Siri. Siri, Ben.

01:32:39.957 --> 01:32:41.025
Nice to meet you.

01:32:41.026 --> 01:32:43.027
I think we're in the same dorm.

01:32:43.028 --> 01:32:44.161
Yeah. Yeah?

01:32:44.162 --> 01:32:50.169
Exactly. That's... shocking I
haven't met you before.

01:32:51.169 --> 01:32:53.403
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

01:32:53.404 --> 01:32:54.237
Isaac.

01:32:54.238 --> 01:32:55.472
Josh.

01:32:55.473 --> 01:32:57.241
Did you get enough
macaroni and cheese?

01:32:57.242 --> 01:32:58.442
Shut up, Josh.

01:32:58.443 --> 01:32:59.576
Did you order the Mountain?

01:32:59.577 --> 01:33:01.111
Sh-I got this. Shut up Josh.

01:33:01.112 --> 01:33:02.215
Hi. I'm Sarah.

01:33:03.215 --> 01:33:04.247
Hi, Alex.

01:33:04.248 --> 01:33:05.249
Nice to meet you.

01:33:05.250 --> 01:33:06.536
Nice to meet you too.

01:33:09.153 --> 01:33:11.554
Ignore him, anything he says.

01:33:11.555 --> 01:33:13.389
Can you believe these guys?

01:33:13.390 --> 01:33:14.929
I'm sure you'll fit right in.

01:33:17.929 --> 01:33:21.464
Ben, want to just take a
solo, or do you want to

01:33:21.465 --> 01:33:23.272
join the group?

01:33:27.272 --> 01:33:28.506
Come on.

01:33:29.506 --> 01:33:31.310
Alright, posture everyone.

01:33:32.910 --> 01:33:35.178
Uh, I'm going to need
you to get a lot closer

01:33:35.179 --> 01:33:37.582
together than that.

01:33:38.582 --> 01:33:39.650
Okay.

01:33:39.651 --> 01:33:41.184
Come on, come on.

01:33:41.185 --> 01:33:42.152
Alright.

01:33:42.153 --> 01:33:43.753
I'm going to pose a
quick idea, you guys.

01:33:43.754 --> 01:33:46.224
Maybe next time we
do this, it's a happy occasion.

01:33:46.824 --> 01:33:48.104
Is there going to
be a next time?

01:33:48.126 --> 01:33:49.026
Uh oh.

01:33:49.027 --> 01:33:50.661
- Okay.
- Alex...

01:33:50.662 --> 01:33:53.665
One, two...
