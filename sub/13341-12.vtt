01:10.000 --> 01:11.792
Boo!

01:12.458 --> 01:13.750
Oh, my God,
Caroline.

01:13.750 --> 01:16.583
Oh, don't worry.
I'm not here to suck
your young blood.

01:16.583 --> 01:17.625
Okay.

01:17.625 --> 01:20.417
Just getting our mail,
my little fawn. Hi.

01:20.417 --> 01:22.500
Hi, uh, where
are your shoes?

01:22.500 --> 01:25.125
- Why do I need my shoes?
I'm just in my hallway.
- ( door closes )

01:25.125 --> 01:27.667
Hey, baby, if there's
a note from the library,

01:27.667 --> 01:29.125
will you just
leave it in there?

01:29.125 --> 01:31.834
I don't want to see it.
It's gonna stress
my brain out.

01:31.834 --> 01:33.500
Okay, got it,
marble cheek.

01:33.500 --> 01:35.625
Hey, um, do you know
where the iced tea is?

01:35.625 --> 01:36.834
I was looking
and I couldn't find it.

01:36.834 --> 01:38.333
All I saw was
the kombucha mother.

01:38.333 --> 01:40.083
- Is it--
- Sweetie, it's in
the iced tea pitcher

01:40.083 --> 01:43.834
that we got
in the garage sale upstate
on the iced tea shelf.

01:43.834 --> 01:46.792
- Laird: In the fridge?
- In the fridge.

01:46.792 --> 01:49.291
Okay.
I'll see you later.

01:49.291 --> 01:52.500
- Caroline: I'll be in
in a minute.
- All right. Bye, Hannah.

01:54.834 --> 01:57.875
- So, you're...
- Yeah, with Laird.

01:57.875 --> 01:59.166
- Wow.
- God, it turns out

01:59.166 --> 02:02.333
he is just
an extremely integrated
human being, Hannah.

02:02.333 --> 02:03.750
- I never would've known.
- Yeah.

02:03.750 --> 02:06.458
We've been up
at his brother's compound
in upstate New York

02:06.458 --> 02:09.250
just getting as healthy
as we everly can

02:09.250 --> 02:13.500
because we are
actually...

02:14.708 --> 02:16.583
Having a b--
a baby?

02:16.583 --> 02:19.375
Yeah.
Oh, God, I feel
amazing, Hannah.

02:19.375 --> 02:20.917
- Can I?
- Please, yeah.

02:20.917 --> 02:23.208
- Wow.
- You know, we're not
gonna find out, of course.

02:23.208 --> 02:25.542
We want it
to be a surprise,
but I know, you know?

02:25.542 --> 02:31.458
I can feel
the labia forming.
This is a woman.

02:31.458 --> 02:36.542
It definitely feels
as though there is
a vagina coming together.

02:36.542 --> 02:40.125
Um, how is Adam?

02:40.125 --> 02:41.542
Oh, Adam's amazing.

02:41.542 --> 02:43.041
He got a part
in a Broadway play,

02:43.041 --> 02:45.792
so he is doing
the best ever.

02:45.792 --> 02:47.250
That is
so good to hear.

02:47.250 --> 02:50.250
You know, I really hope
this brings him closer
to his truth.

02:50.250 --> 02:53.625
You know, hopefully,
and that he doesn't
shuck you off

02:53.625 --> 02:55.542
like a piece of summer corn
in the process...

02:55.542 --> 02:57.834
- Yeah.
- ...as he'll do.

02:57.834 --> 03:01.000
Okay, off to take
my folic acid...

03:01.000 --> 03:03.333
and then some!

03:03.333 --> 03:06.959
- ( door opens, closes )
- ( music playing )

03:13.291 --> 03:14.917
Garbage.

03:15.875 --> 03:17.583
Bullshit.

03:17.583 --> 03:19.250
That guy's dead.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.458
Fuck.

03:36.542 --> 03:37.834
( gasps )

03:47.792 --> 03:51.625
( music continues )

03:59.208 --> 04:01.542
If you're here to tell me
what a bad person I am,

04:01.542 --> 04:04.208
I don't wanna hear it.
Seriously, I know.

04:04.208 --> 04:06.458
And, no, I have not told
Shoshanna yet, but I will,

04:06.458 --> 04:07.959
and I fucking know
I have to do it.

04:07.959 --> 04:10.291
And I know that I need
to have more respect

04:10.291 --> 04:13.291
for the emotional
property of other women,

04:13.291 --> 04:17.333
and I know that I
use sex for validation
'cause it's what I do,

04:17.333 --> 04:19.834
- but just--
- I got into Iowa.

04:19.834 --> 04:21.583
What?

04:21.583 --> 04:24.500
I got into
Iowa Writers' Workshop,

04:24.500 --> 04:26.333
which is graduate school.

04:26.333 --> 04:28.166
- Hannah!
- ( laughs )

04:28.166 --> 04:31.667
Oh, my God!
Are you-- oh, my God.

04:31.667 --> 04:33.959
This is the most--
I'm sorry I got you
so wet.

04:33.959 --> 04:36.000
- Don't worry!
- Holy shit.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.500
Hannah, that's, like,
the best MFA program
in the world.

04:39.500 --> 04:40.792
I know!

04:40.792 --> 04:44.166
- Hannah, holy shit.
- I know.

04:44.166 --> 04:46.166
You're gonna, like,
live in Iowa.

04:46.166 --> 04:47.542
Well, I don't know
if I'm gonna go.

04:47.542 --> 04:50.792
Hannah, you got into Iowa.
You fucking go.

04:50.792 --> 04:53.667
Beedie:
So think about it.

04:53.667 --> 04:55.542
It's all I'm asking.

04:55.542 --> 04:59.208
Beedie, it's not
gonna happen.

04:59.208 --> 05:00.875
You're selfish,
that's what it is.

05:00.875 --> 05:04.041
I can tell you've
never done another thing
for another person.

05:04.041 --> 05:07.917
Beedie, I am not going
to help you kill yourself.

05:07.917 --> 05:10.500
Really, I cannot keep
having this discussion.

05:10.500 --> 05:14.125
- Okay.
- The first day, I thought
it was colorful and cute.

05:14.125 --> 05:15.708
Now it's just
getting bizarre.

05:15.708 --> 05:17.208
Please, I beg you
to stop.

05:17.208 --> 05:21.208
Oh, well, fine.
Well, why don't
you just go?

05:21.208 --> 05:24.417
- Are you firing me?
- I'm not firing you...

05:24.417 --> 05:28.250
but I just had in mind
something different.

05:28.250 --> 05:32.834
Do you know that I
wake up every day

05:32.834 --> 05:37.083
disappointed that
I didn't die in the night?

05:37.083 --> 05:39.667
No, I don't blame you.

05:39.667 --> 05:43.500
So, let me
get this straight.

05:43.500 --> 05:47.041
You hired me
because you knew
I could get you drugs.

05:48.917 --> 05:52.792
I hired you
because I thought

05:52.792 --> 05:55.208
you were
the only person

05:55.208 --> 05:58.500
who would see
how necessary this was.

05:58.500 --> 06:00.417
( sighs )

06:00.417 --> 06:02.792
Listen to me.

06:04.083 --> 06:07.291
I'm tired.
My body's gone.

06:07.291 --> 06:11.125
And I'm compassionate
to that, but I just--

06:11.125 --> 06:14.208
I'm in so much pain,
Jessa.

06:17.166 --> 06:19.375
I can see that.

06:19.375 --> 06:22.542
I just--

06:22.542 --> 06:24.166
processing.

06:24.166 --> 06:26.375
Just do it...

06:26.375 --> 06:27.959
for me.

06:29.041 --> 06:31.250
( faintly )
Fuck.

06:37.250 --> 06:39.041
Hi, um,
Shoshanna Shapiro?

06:39.041 --> 06:42.708
S as in Sam,
H as in Hank, A as in Apple,
P as in Paltrow...

06:42.708 --> 06:43.959
Yeah, I can spell.

06:43.959 --> 06:46.834
So, I ordered your cap and gown
in the traditional violet,

06:46.834 --> 06:48.708
and I also ordered the
protective plastic poncho

06:48.708 --> 06:50.250
just in case of, like,
inclement weather.

06:50.250 --> 06:54.625
And I will be carrying
my Aunt Ilene's NYU graduation
flag from, like, 1922.

06:54.625 --> 06:57.208
Mm, looks like your name
has been flagged.

06:57.208 --> 07:01.083
Mm-hmm, yeah,
I just said I'm carrying
my Aunt Ilene's flag.

07:01.083 --> 07:04.500
Uh, no, I mean,
I can't give you your
graduation materials.

07:04.500 --> 07:06.667
You gotta go
see your advisor.

07:06.667 --> 07:09.166
That doesn't
make any sense.

07:09.166 --> 07:13.333
I-- I'm gonna need
some more information.

07:13.333 --> 07:15.834
Uh, I'm just a junior.
Sorry.

07:16.917 --> 07:18.333
Next?

07:20.625 --> 07:22.667
Excuse me!

07:22.667 --> 07:27.834
( heavy metal music
playing )

07:27.834 --> 07:31.667
♪ The world
doesn't owe you shit ♪

07:33.500 --> 07:38.166
♪ The universe
doesn't know you exist. ♪

07:43.083 --> 07:45.500
( pounding on door )

07:50.917 --> 07:54.041
Hey, Shosh.
Is this a good time?

07:54.041 --> 07:56.375
Shoshanna:
Yeah.

07:56.375 --> 07:57.542
What's up?

07:57.542 --> 07:59.333
Not graduating.
That's what's up.

07:59.333 --> 08:00.917
What? Why?

08:00.917 --> 08:02.375
Apparently I'm missing
three credits

08:02.375 --> 08:04.125
because my fucking cunt
of a glaciology professor

08:04.125 --> 08:07.375
decided to fail
the shit out of me.

08:07.375 --> 08:10.792
Oh, my gosh.
I'm so sorry.

08:10.792 --> 08:15.291
Do you think
maybe you were a little
distracted this semester?

08:15.291 --> 08:18.333
- Yeah, maybe.
- 'Cause I get that.

08:18.333 --> 08:20.250
My junior year
at Oberlin,

08:20.250 --> 08:23.208
when Charlie and I
first got together,
we were so lazy.

08:23.208 --> 08:25.625
Like, all we did
was eat frozen waffles
and lie in bed

08:25.625 --> 08:26.917
and watch old episodes
of "Blossom,"

08:26.917 --> 08:29.834
and I just
did not go to my
Intro to Hinduism class.

08:29.834 --> 08:32.625
I couldn't motivate,
couldn't do it,
didn't do it.

08:32.625 --> 08:34.707
And then when
they announced
the final,

08:34.707 --> 08:36.582
I was probably
too scared to fail
that...

08:36.582 --> 08:40.207
so I didn't
go to that either.

08:42.082 --> 08:44.542
Thank you.

08:44.542 --> 08:47.959
It is really helpful
to know that you were
a fuck-up, too.

08:47.959 --> 08:49.917
Okay.

08:49.917 --> 08:52.083
And I hate
to change the subject,

08:52.083 --> 08:53.625
and we can
come back to this--

08:53.625 --> 08:55.417
we should
come back to this--

08:55.417 --> 08:58.166
but there's just something
I feel like you should know.

08:58.166 --> 09:01.125
And it's probably
not a big deal,

09:01.125 --> 09:02.792
and you're probably
gonna be, like, insulted

09:02.792 --> 09:05.959
that I even implied
that you would care,
but...

09:05.959 --> 09:09.834
I slept with Ray.

09:09.834 --> 09:11.375
More than once.

09:11.375 --> 09:13.625
Sometimes
multiple times
a night,

09:13.625 --> 09:16.125
but it came from,
like,

09:16.125 --> 09:18.667
a deep place
of insecurity.

09:18.667 --> 09:21.458
I'm not proud,
at all,

09:21.458 --> 09:24.125
and I just wanted you
to know that.

09:24.125 --> 09:28.291
But I was hoping
we could just...

09:28.291 --> 09:30.250
you know, you've
been going through
a lot of stuff,

09:30.250 --> 09:32.625
so I was hoping
we could just, like,
talk that through,

09:32.625 --> 09:34.250
- go to the theater--
- ( yells )

09:34.250 --> 09:37.625
( screams )
I hate you!

09:51.333 --> 09:54.000
( ringing )

09:54.000 --> 09:57.667
- ( phone rings )
- Hello?

09:57.667 --> 10:00.166
- ( rings )
- Hannah?

10:00.166 --> 10:01.834
Hi, Mommy, hi, Daddy.

10:01.834 --> 10:03.166
Hey, how are you, doll?

10:03.166 --> 10:04.834
Hannah on phone:
Good, I'm good. I have
some big news.

10:04.834 --> 10:07.333
Is it about the growth
on your tongue?

10:07.333 --> 10:10.083
No, it's that I'm, um--

10:10.083 --> 10:11.917
I got into
graduate school.

10:11.917 --> 10:14.500
- What?
- Holy wow!

10:14.500 --> 10:16.500
I didn't even know
you were applying!

10:16.500 --> 10:18.792
Yeah,
Iowa Writers' Workshop.

10:18.792 --> 10:21.542
Oh, honey,
that is amazing.

10:21.542 --> 10:23.542
It's exciting.
I'm doing a little jig here.

10:23.542 --> 10:26.875
( slaps knee )
I don't know if
I'm gonna actually go.

10:26.875 --> 10:29.000
I don't know if it's
really a good time
for me to, like--

10:29.000 --> 10:33.041
To, what, change the course
of your entire professional
life?

10:33.041 --> 10:34.750
Well, honey,
it is a big choice.

10:34.750 --> 10:37.208
Yeah, Mom,
it's a really big choice.
It's not that simple.

10:37.208 --> 10:39.708
It's like this is
where I live, you know?

10:39.708 --> 10:41.375
I'd have to find
new friends,

10:41.375 --> 10:43.375
I'd have to find
a new place to buy yogurt.

10:43.375 --> 10:45.750
Plus, I don't really know
if writing is something
that can be taught,

10:45.750 --> 10:47.792
although I have to say,
the last four years of my life

10:47.792 --> 10:50.166
have been a total wash,
we can all admit that.

10:50.166 --> 10:53.375
Well, I'm glad
you're being honest
with yourself.

10:53.375 --> 10:55.500
Wait, hold the phone.
Are you kidding me?

10:55.500 --> 10:56.834
( Loreen scoffs )

10:56.834 --> 10:59.959
When opportunities like this
arise, you figure it out.

10:59.959 --> 11:03.375
You say yes
and you figure it out.

11:03.375 --> 11:05.583
- That's how this works.
- Your mother is right.

11:05.583 --> 11:08.875
Big chances are never
small stakes, honey.

11:08.875 --> 11:10.542
Oh, my God.
( laughing )

11:10.542 --> 11:13.208
You guys sound like
you're really proud of me.

11:13.208 --> 11:15.250
- Just go ahead.
- Just go ahead.

11:15.250 --> 11:17.250
- We'll figure it out.
- ( laughs )

11:17.250 --> 11:19.792
- Tad: We'll figure it out.
- Whoo!

11:19.792 --> 11:21.875
- ( laughs )
- ( Loreen whoops )

11:21.875 --> 11:24.959
( voices chattering )

11:26.583 --> 11:28.291
( knock on door )

11:28.291 --> 11:30.583
( British accent )
Enter, governor!

11:32.208 --> 11:35.542
So, you're really
stickin' with the accent?

11:35.542 --> 11:37.792
- Hey.
- I have to.

11:37.792 --> 11:41.291
Not gonna work
without a bit
of practice.

11:41.291 --> 11:44.375
The security guard
tried to stop me,
but Desi let me in.

11:44.375 --> 11:47.041
I'm sorry to barge in
or whatever.

11:47.041 --> 11:49.250
I know you
need your space...

11:49.250 --> 11:53.667
but I wanted to tell you
that I'm so proud of you.

11:54.959 --> 11:57.291
I'm so proud of you.

11:57.291 --> 12:02.125
You've taught me so much
about perseverance

12:02.125 --> 12:06.500
and commitment
and creativity.

12:08.458 --> 12:10.500
( normal accent )
Well, I love you.

12:10.500 --> 12:12.500
I love you, too.

12:14.250 --> 12:16.333
I love you.

12:17.542 --> 12:20.875
And before I go,
which I will do
in a second,

12:20.875 --> 12:25.583
I wanted to tell you
that I got into
grad school...

12:25.583 --> 12:26.875
in Iowa...

12:26.875 --> 12:28.750
at the Iowa
Writers' Workshop,

12:28.750 --> 12:32.500
and I didn't expect it,
but the thing is,

12:32.500 --> 12:35.667
watching you
thrive creatively

12:35.667 --> 12:37.500
over these
past few weeks,

12:37.500 --> 12:40.041
it's made me
want to thrive.

12:40.041 --> 12:42.333
It's made me want to
find a hole in the world

12:42.333 --> 12:45.917
in the shape of me
and just fill it up,

12:45.917 --> 12:49.208
- and I know that sounds crazy--
- It doesn't sound crazy.

12:53.834 --> 12:56.333
And I have to
decide soon, and...

12:56.333 --> 12:59.792
I think I'm gonna
tell them yes...

12:59.792 --> 13:01.667
and then figure it out.

13:01.667 --> 13:03.291
'Cause that's
what people do.

13:03.291 --> 13:07.417
We can figure it out,
and then we can be one of
those artist couples...

13:07.417 --> 13:09.417
- ( chuckles )
- ...who are doing different
things in different rooms

13:09.417 --> 13:12.834
and they call to each other
and say, "Look at what
I'm doing."

13:14.041 --> 13:15.333
- Okay?
- Okay.

13:15.333 --> 13:18.542
Don't just break one leg,
break all your legs.

13:22.583 --> 13:24.417
Bye, sir.

13:24.417 --> 13:26.375
( British accent )
Later.

13:32.750 --> 13:34.375
Ray:
I haven't been
to a Broadway show

13:34.375 --> 13:36.708
since my parents drove me in
to see a matinee of "Falsettos,"

13:36.708 --> 13:39.917
at which point
they told me my grandparents
were getting divorced.

13:39.917 --> 13:42.875
We should try
to get you a blazer
before the show starts.

13:42.875 --> 13:44.125
What's wrong
with this?

13:44.125 --> 13:46.917
I'm just so excited for Adam.
Look at all these people!

13:46.917 --> 13:48.291
What's gotten
into you?

13:48.291 --> 13:51.708
You were in such a deep groove,
begrudging the success
of others.

13:51.708 --> 13:53.750
- Hi. Hi.
- Hannah: Hey.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.417
Um, I'll be
right back.

13:55.417 --> 13:58.458
Bye, Shosh.
Good talk.

13:58.458 --> 14:00.500
We're gonna have
a chat.

14:00.500 --> 14:03.083
At intermission,
you're gonna buy me
some M&Ms

14:03.083 --> 14:05.917
and we're gonna
have a fucking chat.

14:08.333 --> 14:10.041
( knock on door )

14:10.041 --> 14:14.375
Oh, I'm not quite ready
to put my shirt on, Stacy.
Thank you, love.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.000
Marnie:
No, no, no, it's me,
it's Marnie.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.166
- They're not letting me in.
- Security guard:
Don't worry, I got her.

14:19.166 --> 14:20.750
Oh, no, no, Oscar, it's okay.
She's a friend.

14:20.750 --> 14:22.959
( door opens, closes )

14:22.959 --> 14:24.667
Both:
Hey.

14:24.667 --> 14:25.875
- Hello.
- Hi.

14:25.875 --> 14:28.417
- Happy opening night.
- Oh, thank you.

14:28.417 --> 14:31.542
It's so exciting.
Wow.

14:31.542 --> 14:34.667
I've always wanted to know
what it's like in a Broadway
dressing room.

14:34.667 --> 14:37.125
- Yeah.
- How cool is this?

14:37.125 --> 14:39.834
Lotta ghosts,
you know?

14:39.834 --> 14:41.125
I'm sorry,
I'm kind of, like,

14:41.125 --> 14:42.458
half in the play,
half here.

14:42.458 --> 14:45.250
No, no, no, totally.
I will get out of your hair.

14:45.250 --> 14:50.083
I just wanted to give you
a little opening night present.

14:50.083 --> 14:51.333
What?

14:51.333 --> 14:53.750
It's nothing.
Really, it's nothing.

14:53.750 --> 14:55.750
You'll see.

14:55.750 --> 14:56.708
Thank you.

14:56.708 --> 14:59.250
It's, um--
well, you'll see.

14:59.250 --> 15:04.375
It belonged
to James Taylor.
It's his pick.

15:04.375 --> 15:06.000
- ( gasps )
- ( laughs )

15:06.000 --> 15:09.542
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- I just-- I know that he's
a hero of yours,

15:09.542 --> 15:13.125
both in his music
and also in the honest way
that he lives his life.

15:13.125 --> 15:17.083
- Thank you. Thank you.
- So break a leg.

15:36.125 --> 15:38.834
( glasses clink )

15:50.500 --> 15:52.208
Um...

15:52.208 --> 15:54.250
okay.

15:54.250 --> 15:56.166
I'm gonna--

15:56.166 --> 15:58.125
I'm gonna go.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.458
Uh, break a leg.
I'll see you after.

16:02.458 --> 16:05.208
- Thank you.
I will see you after.
- Okay.

16:06.875 --> 16:08.333
What are you
so cheerful about?

16:08.333 --> 16:10.041
'Cause it does not
look like it went that well
with Shoshanna.

16:10.041 --> 16:12.375
Marnie:
No, no, it's fine.
We worked it out.

16:12.375 --> 16:15.417
It'll be fine. Um...

16:15.417 --> 16:17.375
Desi kissed me.

16:18.583 --> 16:21.708
- Are you fucking serious?
- I'm dead serious.

16:21.708 --> 16:23.417
Marnie,
that's another person
with a girlfriend.

16:23.417 --> 16:25.291
- He kissed me--
- Announcer: Ladies
and gentlemen...

16:25.291 --> 16:27.208
- welcome
to the Belasco Theatre.
- Guys, shh, shh.

16:27.208 --> 16:29.708
Announcer:
Please remember
that the use of photography

16:29.708 --> 16:32.875
and any recording device
is strictly prohibited.

16:32.875 --> 16:35.375
And please silence
all cell phones.

16:35.375 --> 16:37.792
- Thank you.
- Hannah: You guys,
silence your phones.

16:37.792 --> 16:39.041
Elijah:
It's been silent.

16:39.041 --> 16:41.500
- Hannah: Ray, don't
take pictures.
- Ray: Okay.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.667
( bell ringing )

16:44.667 --> 16:46.458
Man:
What's the matter?

16:46.458 --> 16:48.375
( whispering )
Why are they talking
like that?

16:48.375 --> 16:50.542
- It's not Shakespeare.
- ( whispers )
They're British.

16:50.542 --> 16:54.083
- Woman: Presently, Stephen.
- But it's called
"Major Barbara."

16:54.083 --> 16:56.750
So?

16:56.750 --> 16:59.291
Shoshanna, ask questions
at intermission.

16:59.291 --> 17:00.875
( horse hooves clopping )

17:00.875 --> 17:02.750
Adam wasn't even
in the first act.

17:02.750 --> 17:06.333
He's, like, a major part
of the second act, though.

17:06.333 --> 17:07.916
I have to say,
I'm really gonna be sad

17:07.916 --> 17:09.541
living in the city
without you.

17:09.541 --> 17:11.040
You're not gonna be
without me all the time.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.375
I'm gonna be back and forth.
I'll be bicoastal.

17:13.375 --> 17:15.500
Iowa's not a coast.

17:15.500 --> 17:18.208
It's a figure of speech.
I'm gonna pee.

17:18.208 --> 17:20.416
( scoffs )

17:20.416 --> 17:23.458
The show is not gonna
get good notices.

17:23.458 --> 17:25.000
Desi kissed
the shit out of me.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.541
What? He's so cute.

17:27.541 --> 17:28.583
Oh, my God, I know.

17:28.583 --> 17:30.959
- I was not expecting it...
- Oh, Marnie.

17:30.959 --> 17:34.542
...and it was the best.
Elijah, it was so satisfying.

17:34.542 --> 17:36.417
I have to say, I don't
see that ending well
for you, though.

17:36.417 --> 17:39.208
- What do you mean?
- I'm really intuitive
about these things.

17:39.208 --> 17:41.458
I've predicted two
of my friends' divorces,

17:41.458 --> 17:44.792
one pregnancy, and a couple
natural disasters.

17:44.792 --> 17:46.834
Are these the ones
you wanted?

17:47.750 --> 17:49.458
Yeah?

17:53.417 --> 17:56.500
Intermission's
kind of short,
so if you--

17:56.500 --> 17:58.750
if there's something
you wanted to...

18:01.083 --> 18:04.291
Okay, I'll go first.
I'm sorry.

18:04.291 --> 18:08.667
But if memory serves,
you're the one who
jettisoned me a while ago.

18:08.667 --> 18:10.500
And you weren't
very discreet

18:10.500 --> 18:12.500
about keeping
your assignations
out of my face,

18:12.500 --> 18:14.708
so I can't be that sorry
at the end of the day.

18:14.708 --> 18:18.000
Right? I mean,
I really can't.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.333
I want you back.

18:21.208 --> 18:23.333
- What?
- I want you back.

18:23.333 --> 18:26.000
I just had the--
I-I-I want you back.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.417
I-- I miss you.

18:28.417 --> 18:30.083
I made a mistake,

18:30.083 --> 18:33.500
and this whole
entire year of freedom
was just fucking stupid

18:33.500 --> 18:36.834
and I want to be
with you again.

18:36.834 --> 18:40.750
Shosh, I know
you don't really--

18:40.750 --> 18:43.834
you're jealous 'cause I went
swimming at the country club
with Marnie? Is that it?

18:43.834 --> 18:48.041
What? No.
Because you make me
a more stable human.

18:48.041 --> 18:50.667
And you make me want to be
the best version of myself,

18:50.667 --> 18:52.166
and I just want to be
your girlfriend again,

18:52.166 --> 18:55.875
and I want to pretend
that I was never not
your girlfriend before.

18:59.458 --> 19:01.875
I love you.
I love you.

19:01.875 --> 19:06.208
Shosh, look,
I'm eternally
grateful to you

19:06.208 --> 19:08.834
'cause I have
a real job now, with
real responsibilities.

19:08.834 --> 19:10.208
I have my first
credit card.

19:10.208 --> 19:11.667
I've got a credenza.
I've got a cactus plant.

19:11.667 --> 19:14.542
That's because of you.
You understand?

19:14.542 --> 19:16.375
You pushed me forward
in a lot of ways,

19:16.375 --> 19:18.333
and I'm eternally
appreciative of that.

19:18.333 --> 19:21.667
Okay? But right now,
we're in different places,

19:21.667 --> 19:25.041
and we have very, very,
very different goals.

19:25.041 --> 19:28.500
Please? Please?

19:28.500 --> 19:31.792
- It's not a matter of...
- ( bell chimes )

19:31.792 --> 19:33.917
Please?

19:35.917 --> 19:38.417
We should go upstairs.

19:49.250 --> 19:51.917
Feel better
after your meal, sir?

19:51.917 --> 19:53.291
( British accent )
No, call that a meal.

19:53.291 --> 19:55.625
- Good enough
for you, perhaps...
- ( whispers ) Hannah!

19:55.625 --> 19:58.834
- but what's it to me,
an intelligent working man?
- Hannah?

19:58.834 --> 20:00.834
Working man?
What are ya?

20:00.834 --> 20:02.792
- Adam: A painter.
- Woman: Oh, yes, I--

20:02.792 --> 20:04.750
Adam:
Yes, I daresay, I know.

20:04.750 --> 20:08.083
Every loafer
can't do nothing
calls himself a painter.

20:08.083 --> 20:11.458
- Well, I'm a real painter...
- ( whispers ) He's really good.

20:11.458 --> 20:13.625
38 bob a week,
if I can get it.

20:13.625 --> 20:15.834
Well, why don't you
go and get it?

20:15.834 --> 20:19.458
I'll tell you why.
First, I'm intelligent.

20:19.458 --> 20:23.417
- ( woman scoffs )
- ( huffs )
It's rotten cold here.

20:23.417 --> 20:25.792
Yes, intelligent
beyond the station of life

20:25.792 --> 20:28.583
into which it has pleased
the capitalists to call me.

20:31.125 --> 20:34.208
You are both
very naughty children.

20:34.208 --> 20:35.792
What do you want,
Barbara?

20:35.792 --> 20:39.125
I want a house
and a village to
live in with Dolly.

20:39.125 --> 20:41.291
Come and tell me
which one to take.

20:41.291 --> 20:44.792
6:00 tomorrow morning,
my young friend.

20:49.792 --> 20:53.333
( audience applauding )

21:06.417 --> 21:09.708
( Hannah, Marnie
cheering )

21:16.834 --> 21:19.500
Oh, my God.

21:19.500 --> 21:22.667
- Let's come every night.
- ( laughs )

21:24.333 --> 21:27.792
( toilet flushes )

21:36.125 --> 21:38.000
Clementine.
Oh, my gosh.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.166
I thought
you were traveling.

21:41.166 --> 21:43.000
I'm back.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.834
Desi's gonna be, um--

21:44.834 --> 21:47.375
he's gonna be so excited
that you could be here tonight.

21:47.375 --> 21:49.917
You know what?
Can you cut
the shit, please?

21:49.917 --> 21:53.708
I mean, I know
what you're up to.
It's written all over you.

21:53.708 --> 21:55.875
I don't blame you.
He's fucking sexy,

21:55.875 --> 21:58.333
but if he hasn't
realized it yet,
he's going to soon

21:58.333 --> 22:01.708
that you're just, like,
a sad, pathetic mess.

22:01.708 --> 22:05.375
Clementine,
please believe me.
I was not trying--

22:05.375 --> 22:07.458
Seriously,
shut the fuck up.

22:07.458 --> 22:10.041
Has anyone
ever taught you
when to speak?

22:11.458 --> 22:12.917
We're recording
an album.

22:12.917 --> 22:16.250
( laughs )
Not anymore,
you're not.

22:16.250 --> 22:18.917
Nice dress.

22:23.834 --> 22:26.959
You're just gonna
take-- take these.

22:28.959 --> 22:31.291
You got 'em?
You got it?

22:31.291 --> 22:33.875
Okay.
Take this now.

22:36.083 --> 22:39.250
- More.
- ( slurps, swallows )

22:39.250 --> 22:40.917
- It's okay if you choke.
- ( laughing )

22:40.917 --> 22:45.291
It's just a different route
to the same thing.

22:45.291 --> 22:48.792
( chuckles )
I really feel great.

22:48.792 --> 22:52.583
Jessa, don't you
take any of these pills
after I'm gone.

22:52.583 --> 22:54.291
No, I won't.

22:54.291 --> 22:57.208
Somehow they don't
look nearly as fun

22:57.208 --> 23:00.166
when they're being used
to murder someone.

23:00.166 --> 23:02.458
Mm.

23:02.458 --> 23:07.750
I am so moved
that you would
do this for me.

23:09.458 --> 23:12.125
Well, I didn't
want to do it.

23:12.125 --> 23:13.959
- You didn't want to...
- No.

23:13.959 --> 23:16.291
...but you did.

23:21.125 --> 23:23.792
I have never--

23:24.625 --> 23:27.417
never mind.

23:29.083 --> 23:31.125
So, now...

23:32.125 --> 23:34.583
I guess
we just wait.

23:37.458 --> 23:41.041
The fucking celebrities
that come to these things
are nuts.

23:41.041 --> 23:42.667
- Debi Mazar...
- Amazing.

23:42.667 --> 23:46.500
Rosie Perez,
Mark Consuelos--
sadly, no Kelly Ripa--

23:46.500 --> 23:48.875
but there was, like,
a blonde with him that
threw me for a second.

23:48.875 --> 23:51.291
- I can't believe--
- Wendy Williams...

23:51.291 --> 23:52.417
- No.
- Treat Williams...

23:52.417 --> 23:54.000
- From "Everwood"?
- Yes.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.083
Sam Champion...

23:55.083 --> 23:56.834
I mean, I did so much
sense memory work.

23:56.834 --> 23:58.333
- You know how hard I work.
- Oh, I could tell.

23:58.333 --> 24:01.125
Congratulations, you guys,
on your big achievement.

24:01.125 --> 24:03.375
Thank you.
It's all for Him.

24:03.375 --> 24:04.625
( chuckles )
Oh.

24:04.625 --> 24:07.208
- She's so cute in real life.
- Kinda douchy, though.

24:07.208 --> 24:08.500
- Hey!
- Hey!

24:08.500 --> 24:11.000
- Congratulations! Awesome job!
- Right, thanks, hey.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.875
- Hi, my love.
You were amazing.
- So good.

24:13.875 --> 24:15.667
No, I wasn't.
I was fucking terrible.

24:15.667 --> 24:18.291
- Oh...
- Are you kidding me?

24:18.291 --> 24:20.834
Adam, I had
full body chills.

24:20.834 --> 24:22.375
Yeah, she's not joking.
She had chills.

24:22.375 --> 24:24.333
- See you guys.
- Man: See you later.

24:24.333 --> 24:27.834
Why did you tell me
that thing about Iowa
right before I went onstage?

24:29.792 --> 24:32.250
I fucking blew it.

24:32.250 --> 24:34.875
Okay, do you live in,
like, a parallel universe?

24:34.875 --> 24:36.375
There's no way
that was blowing it.

24:36.375 --> 24:38.083
Everybody was talking about
how much they loved it.

24:38.083 --> 24:40.458
Well, I don't care
what everyone says,
I know if I'm good or not.

24:40.458 --> 24:42.041
This is exactly what
I thought would happen.

24:42.041 --> 24:44.208
This is exactly why
I didn't want to see you.

24:44.208 --> 24:46.333
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

24:47.959 --> 24:49.417
I'm gonna go ahead,

24:49.417 --> 24:51.417
and I will meet you guys
at the party, all right?

24:51.417 --> 24:53.041
- Mm-hmm.
- I, uh...

24:56.500 --> 24:58.583
Elijah loved the play.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.959
Oh, good.

25:05.083 --> 25:06.875
I told you that thing
about grad school

25:06.875 --> 25:10.166
'cause I felt that
it was really good news
for us as a couple.

25:10.166 --> 25:11.834
So now you're
leaving me?

25:11.834 --> 25:16.000
Leaving you?
Adam, you're the one
who moved out of our apartment.

25:16.000 --> 25:20.708
I moved a few blocks away
for a few weeks.

25:22.542 --> 25:25.000
I know that this
is complicated,

25:25.000 --> 25:27.417
but I also know
that we can work it out.

25:27.417 --> 25:30.542
Well, I'm sick
of trying to work it out.

25:30.542 --> 25:32.917
Can't one thing
ever be easy with you?

25:39.917 --> 25:42.417
( sighs )

25:47.583 --> 25:50.792
Congratulations
on a beautiful opening night.

25:52.250 --> 25:54.750
( car horns honking )

25:54.750 --> 25:56.250
( sirens blaring )

25:56.250 --> 26:00.083
( music playing )

26:12.458 --> 26:16.291
Call 9-1-1.
I don't want to die.

26:17.291 --> 26:19.792
Call 9-1-1.
I don't want to die!

26:19.792 --> 26:21.625
- Okay.
- Call 9-1-1!

26:21.625 --> 26:24.458
- She changed her mind.
- Oh, God!

26:25.625 --> 26:28.000
Oh, God.
Okay.

26:33.959 --> 26:36.166
Oopsie-daisy.

26:50.166 --> 26:51.959
- ( grunts )
- ( crashes )

26:54.834 --> 26:58.500
I don't-- I don't know
what else to tell you.
What do you want me to say?

26:58.500 --> 27:00.667
Desi:
I want you to not
fuckin' walk away from me

27:00.667 --> 27:02.333
when I'm trying
to tell you how I feel.

27:02.333 --> 27:03.959
In a fucking bar full
of your theater friends?

27:03.959 --> 27:06.834
- What am I supposed to do?
- Desi: We were not by
any of those people.

27:06.834 --> 27:08.667
We were in the corner.

27:08.667 --> 27:11.458
