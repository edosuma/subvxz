So, is Marisol free
to babysit me and my brother

What about us kids?

Old people are, like, half the work
and pay twice as much.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.784
A no-brainer from a business standpoint.

04:44.867 --> 04:45.827

It's me, Mrs. Templeton.
Marisol the babysitter. Remember?

21:12.187 --> 21:13.355
You let us into the house.

21:13.438 --> 21:16.441
There was a fire at the place
I was sitting, so we had to come here.

21:26.493 --> 21:27.327
Thanks!

21:27.411 --> 21:29.621
We'll give you a call to sit Scooter again
real soon!

21:31.123 --> 21:34.001
You were right, Tim.
I was born to sit babies.

21:34.293 --> 21:37.963
Sure, they've got weird smells too,
but at least I know why.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.966
And you have a real knack
for this business.

21:41.049 --> 21:43.635
You better call me when you're older,
we'll join forces.

How I should call her when I'm older?
Did you hear that part?

21:56.815 --> 21:58.066
[Marisol] Wait, hang on.

21:59.067 --> 22:01.611
I almost forgot.
If your grandma's done with that soup,

22:01.695 --> 22:04.197
can I get the container back?
It's Mr. Estes'.

22:04.281 --> 22:07.409
I should tell him I'm out
of the senior-sitting business anyway.

22:09.036 --> 22:11.288
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of everything.
