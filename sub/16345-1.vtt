Mrs. James:
He used to love singing.

02:41.119 --> 02:43.370
I used to teach him
little jingles,

02:43.538 --> 02:45.789
and he used to love them.

02:45.957 --> 02:48.208
And the chief one
that he used to know was:

02:48.376 --> 02:53.172

02:53.339 --> 02:57.217

And then you would see him,
you know, keeping time,

03:22.368 --> 03:27.206
and you would see
that he was enjoying it.

03:28.291 --> 03:29.416
Interviewer:
How did it all start?

03:29.584 --> 03:30.876
Had music always been
a part of your life

03:31.044 --> 03:32.836
from when you were
a little boy?

Sledgo Peart: Well, you see, Bob Marley
is my cousin, you know?

04:15.296 --> 04:17.089
( Peart speaking )

04:34.983 --> 04:38.110
Bob liked to ride the donkey
and, you know,

04:38.278 --> 04:40.821
go to the field
with his grandfather

04:40.989 --> 04:42.489
and things like that

04:42.657 --> 04:44.992
because he's a country boy,
you know.

04:46.744 --> 04:49.079
Neville "Bunny" Livingston:
Nine Mile was a place that, you know,

04:49.247 --> 04:51.832
there wasn't a lot
of civilized activity.

04:53.459 --> 04:57.004
Electricity was not
available in those areas,

04:57.171 --> 04:59.798
so you see a lot
of peenie wallies...

04:59.966 --> 05:02.009
you know,
those little fireflies.

05:02.176 --> 05:04.636
And that's the only light
at night

05:04.804 --> 05:06.680
other than the moon
and the stars, you know.

05:06.848 --> 05:09.725
So as a youth coming out
of Kingston

05:09.892 --> 05:13.353
that was accustomed to jukebox
and sound system,

05:13.521 --> 05:16.023
it was really something
to get accustomed to.

05:20.611 --> 05:22.487
Interviewer: And do you remember
when you first met Robert?

05:22.655 --> 05:24.197
Livingston: Yes.

05:24.365 --> 05:26.700
First time l saw him,
l saw this little youth

05:26.868 --> 05:28.410
cutting up
this big chunk of wood

05:28.578 --> 05:31.371
and putting it on his head
bit by bit and taking it away...

05:31.539 --> 05:33.457
I say, that's...
you know, and then...

05:33.624 --> 05:36.752
he was the only little,
what you call it,

05:36.919 --> 05:39.546
red pickney in the place,

05:39.714 --> 05:41.882
because everybody else
was black people.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.553
Interviewer: Who was Bob's dad?

05:46.721 --> 05:48.597
( Peart speaking )

05:59.359 --> 06:02.069
Booker: He liked when
you call him Captain.

06:02.236 --> 06:05.364
Yes, but his name is Norval.

06:05.531 --> 06:08.950
I met him right there
in Nine Mile,

06:09.118 --> 06:11.536
and then as a white man
in the district, you know,

06:11.704 --> 06:14.414
always ride his horse
and things like that.

06:14.582 --> 06:16.875
He and my father
becomes good friends.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.586
Then at that time,
he see this little girl

06:19.754 --> 06:21.838
and I guess he liked her,

06:22.006 --> 06:25.509
and we finally
get together and...

06:25.676 --> 06:28.929
that's how it...
that's how it happened.

06:29.097 --> 06:32.057
Interviewer: How old was your sister
when she met the captain?

06:32.225 --> 06:34.851
She was, what, 16.

06:35.019 --> 06:40.107
Captain was...
he was about in his 60s.

06:40.274 --> 06:42.943
- Interviewer: So he was an old man?
- Yes.

06:58.876 --> 07:00.293
My name is Peter Marley,

07:00.461 --> 07:03.588
and Bob Marley
is my second cousin.

07:03.756 --> 07:07.092
Interviewer: What did you know about
Bob Marley's father?

07:07.260 --> 07:10.095
Peter:
He rode a horse most of the time.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.805
He was in the British Army.

07:11.973 --> 07:14.683
I think he was stationed
somewhere in lndia in World War ll

07:14.851 --> 07:17.018
and he got shell shock.

07:20.148 --> 07:23.275
Peter: l understand he drank
and that he lived a...

07:23.443 --> 07:26.361
what should l say...

07:26.529 --> 07:28.989
- a full life.
- ( Interviewer chuckles )

07:56.142 --> 07:59.019
lnterviewer:
Did he get teased for being mixed?

07:59.187 --> 08:02.355
Yeah, sure. Worse than teased.

08:02.523 --> 08:07.027
"Teased" is not the word.
You call it "rejected."

08:07.195 --> 08:09.946
He did everything that his bigger uncles
should be doing

08:10.114 --> 08:13.366
because it was their duty
to move horses

08:13.534 --> 08:15.869
and to make sure
that the pigs were fed,

08:16.037 --> 08:20.207
and they left all
of that work for Robert.

08:20.374 --> 08:23.710
He had to earn his every meal.

08:23.878 --> 08:26.046
( Bob Marley speaking )

08:48.069 --> 08:49.819
Livingston:
We went to the same school

08:49.987 --> 08:51.988
and he had me...
teaching me the stuff

08:52.156 --> 08:53.406
of what takes place
in the country...

08:53.574 --> 08:54.908
how to ride a donkey,
how to ride a horse,

08:55.076 --> 08:57.577
how to do all
of this kind of stuff.

08:57.745 --> 08:59.538
And l taught him about music,

08:59.705 --> 09:02.415
'cause that was
what l was exposed to

09:02.583 --> 09:03.959
prior coming to St. Ann.

09:04.126 --> 09:06.127
( Mento music playing )

09:10.591 --> 09:13.385
Livingston: l was accustomed to
building bamboo guitars

09:13.553 --> 09:15.136
and sardine-tin guitars...

09:15.304 --> 09:17.764
cutting the wire,
the electric wire,

09:17.932 --> 09:20.600
opening it up, taking out
those little fine wires,

09:20.768 --> 09:22.686

We grew up in Trench Town.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.225
We were exposed to everything

12:07.393 --> 12:09.269
'cause you have
the bad guys there

who eventually turn out

12:11.522 --> 12:15.608
You have the musicians
and you have the sportsmen.

12:15.776 --> 12:19.863
Everybody lived just like a block away
from each other.

12:20.030 --> 12:22.657
It's like a melting pot.

12:22.825 --> 12:26.119
Well, living in Trench Town,
you know,

12:26.287 --> 12:29.289
as a young man,
surviving was easy.

12:29.457 --> 12:32.500
The only thing that you have to really
look out for was the police, you know,

12:32.668 --> 12:35.462
'cause the police
can just get you, frame you.

12:35.629 --> 12:37.672
You go to prison and...

12:37.840 --> 12:39.799
"Look, I come
from Trench Town."

12:39.967 --> 12:42.260
Trench Town's that...
find them say, "Where you from?"

12:42.428 --> 12:44.637

you're gone.

- You know what I mean?
- ( Interviewer chuckles )

12:46.223 --> 12:47.223
No, it was tough.

12:47.391 --> 12:48.933
All of Kingston
is like that, you know?

12:49.101 --> 12:52.312
Everybody. A lot of people
don't know, but Bob, me,

12:52.480 --> 12:54.564
all of we went to bed
hungry a lot.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.483
I mean real hungry.
I don't mean like,

12:56.650 --> 12:59.319
"Oh, he had some...
a little piece of this." Nothing.

12:59.487 --> 13:04.032
One of the famous lines was,
"Drink some water and go to bed."

13:04.200 --> 13:05.658
In those days you never have...

13:05.826 --> 13:08.453
you might have one pair of shoes,
one suit of clothes.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.163
So you walk bare feet
all the time.

13:10.331 --> 13:11.414
Bob, too, you know?

13:11.582 --> 13:13.374

don't know that.

13:13.542 --> 13:16.336

and struggle

13:16.504 --> 13:20.006
can make you either
go bad or good.

13:20.174 --> 13:21.800
And I guess that's
what he did, you know?

13:21.967 --> 13:23.968
He figured the music
would get him out,

13:24.136 --> 13:27.180

and focused, you know?

they're forced to be creative

16:11.512 --> 16:13.930
Robert wanted now to record.

16:14.098 --> 16:15.807
So Desmond take him
to Beverley's.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.434
And he went away
and recorded a song

16:18.602 --> 16:23.314
to prove to me that
if he could record a song, l could.

16:39.289 --> 16:43.668
I noticed his use of words
in the songs.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.713
"Judge Not"... it was
a revolutionary song

16:46.880 --> 16:51.259
defending his rights
as an individual.

16:51.427 --> 16:55.680
It occurred to me,
"Wow, this guy's really a good poet."

Cliff: After the recording,

17:02.563 --> 17:04.564
Leslie Kong wanted
to change Bob's name

17:04.732 --> 17:08.568
because Robert Marley didn't
sound so catchy and easy.

17:08.736 --> 17:13.823
So he wanted to call Bob
Adam... Adam Marley.

17:13.991 --> 17:17.160
( Chuckles )
Bob wouldn't have it.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.915
Livingston:
He realizes that a group

17:23.083 --> 17:24.709
would be maybe
the appropriate thing

17:24.877 --> 17:28.087
other than being individual,
solo artists.

17:28.255 --> 17:29.464
We used to listen
to groups like.

17:29.631 --> 17:31.966
Frankie Lymon
and The Teenagers,

17:32.134 --> 17:34.385
The Drifters, The Platters.

17:34.553 --> 17:38.306
So there was a recruitment
process taking place.

17:38.474 --> 17:42.602
Myself and Robert started
to put the group together.

17:42.770 --> 17:46.230
And then here comes
this tall, dark,

17:46.398 --> 17:49.025
as they would say,
handsome dude named Peter,

17:49.193 --> 17:51.444
and he has
this guitar knowledge.

17:51.612 --> 17:54.864
And from Robert, you hear Robert say,
"Play guitar? You serious?"

17:55.032 --> 17:56.699
So he goes, "Give me
the guitar right away."

17:56.867 --> 17:58.201
So it's four-string steel,

17:58.368 --> 18:01.329
but Peter tune the four-string,

18:01.497 --> 18:03.081
and it's just like that.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.210
McDonald:
And First Street is a music street.

18:07.377 --> 18:10.922
We had three or four places
on First Street that we rehearse,

18:11.090 --> 18:13.466
and there we were rehearsing
like every day.

18:13.634 --> 18:16.761
At the time,
it was Bob, Peter, Bunny.

18:16.929 --> 18:20.056
Livingston:
We used to call ourselves "Juveniles,"

18:20.224 --> 18:21.557
"Brothers in the Ghetto."

18:21.725 --> 18:23.643
Where we used to go
to rehearse, they'd say,

18:23.811 --> 18:26.771
"You come from a wailing environment
where people always bawling.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.315
And, well, you should be
named the Wailers."

18:56.176 --> 18:58.511
As far as the Wailers' harmony

18:58.679 --> 19:02.348
and the building
of the Wailers musically,

19:02.516 --> 19:06.561
Joe Higgs
is the responsible person.

19:06.728 --> 19:08.312
Having his own career,

19:08.480 --> 19:12.650
he decided to take
the group up as a project.

19:38.260 --> 19:41.762
( Thunder rumbling )

19:41.930 --> 19:44.390
Livingston:
His policy was that great stars

19:44.558 --> 19:46.934
sometimes get messed up
when they get afraid,

19:47.102 --> 19:49.687
you know, when they get
nervous onstage.

19:49.855 --> 19:53.524
So he said that if we went
to the cemetery

19:53.692 --> 19:55.735
at, say, 2:00 in the morning

19:55.903 --> 19:58.029
and sang for those people,

19:58.197 --> 20:01.574
then we can't be afraid
when we hit the stage.

20:01.742 --> 20:05.661
And we went with Joe,
sat on the graves, played.

20:05.829 --> 20:09.707
Several times we do it until he thought
we were brave enough now.

Clive Chin: Just about the time
of the independence,

20:25.933 --> 20:29.143
the Jamaican musicians
wanted to have a music

20:29.311 --> 20:31.437
that they can call
Jamaican music.

20:31.605 --> 20:33.856
Well, Jamaica came up
with a unique rhythm.

20:34.024 --> 20:36.108
I don't think it was
deliberately done.

20:36.276 --> 20:37.944
I think it was an attempt
to play something,

20:38.111 --> 20:40.029
and it came out that way.

20:40.197 --> 20:43.157
It became known as reggae,
but it started off as ska,

20:43.325 --> 20:45.534
which was putting
all the accent

20:45.702 --> 20:48.746
on a different beat than what is
normally where the accent is.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.540
It would be on the off beat
instead of the on beat.

20:51.708 --> 20:55.086
( Ska music playing )

20:55.254 --> 20:59.298
Cliff: Ska developed out of American
music that we were exposed to

20:59.466 --> 21:02.385
on top of our Jamaican
indigenous music,

22:18.045 --> 22:21.255
in that he has an ear
for music, good music.

22:21.423 --> 22:23.090
He might not have been
an instrument player.

22:23.258 --> 22:25.509
He might not even know
if the guitar is tuned,

22:25.677 --> 22:28.971
but he knows when
the sound is right.

22:29.139 --> 22:31.182

He gave Robbie a record player

23:03.173 --> 23:06.300

23:06.468 --> 23:08.886
Robbie was a fanatic

the Bible a different way.

27:38.615 --> 27:40.658
Most of these places that they're
telling you about

27:40.825 --> 27:42.242

27:42.410 --> 27:44.912
The Garden of Eden
is in Africa.

27:45.080 --> 27:48.123
The teaching that we get
from the elders, then,

27:48.291 --> 27:51.794
is that we always have to look
to a black man as God

27:51.961 --> 27:55.631

we can identiry with.

growing dreadlocks.

that you were a Rastafarian

Nazarite vow...

not to cut or comb your hair
for a certain length of time,

and is not to be taken lightly.

28:55.942 --> 28:57.943

are the dreadlocks?

28:58.111 --> 28:59.445

29:01.698 --> 29:03.282
Yeah, this is my identity.

how you treat other people.

30:05.136 --> 30:07.846
When I was born,
you know, and growing,

30:08.014 --> 30:12.017
there was a certain amount
of consciousness

30:12.185 --> 30:14.144
in the higher self

some of them smoking.

31:56.039 --> 31:57.623
Our police were powerless.

31:57.790 --> 32:00.792

of the plane, l remember,

32:00.960 --> 32:03.962

and he just looked

32:04.130 --> 32:05.839

The deeper Bob got into the faith,

33:33.553 --> 33:35.220

33:35.388 --> 33:39.725
the more his music
became entwined.

33:41.352 --> 33:45.063
He was very into the social
commentary side of the music.

33:45.231 --> 33:48.442
Mr. Dodd didn't like that because it
wasn't commercial enough.

33:48.609 --> 33:50.235

42:36.929 --> 42:38.429
lt is mentioned often
in the Bible

42:38.597 --> 42:42.767
that there shall be a music that all
people of all global concerns

42:42.935 --> 42:45.436
shall play and dance
and sing this music.

42:45.604 --> 42:47.355
It's in the Revelation.

42:47.523 --> 42:49.607
What other music could that be?

42:51.151 --> 42:53.027
Reggae.

42:53.195 --> 42:56.531
What really changed it
to reggae

42:56.699 --> 42:59.284
was the riff actually
with the guitar.

42:59.451 --> 43:01.953
It just basically
a rhythm change

43:02.121 --> 43:04.414
in terms of what the guitar...

43:04.582 --> 43:07.458
the guitar used to play
like cha, cha, cha.

43:07.626 --> 43:11.546

chaka, chaka, chaka, chaka.

43:42.578 --> 43:44.329
from the United States.

43:44.496 --> 43:48.124
And it was in the studio for a long time
and no one knew what to do with it.

43:48.292 --> 43:49.917
They decided to hook it up.

43:50.085 --> 43:52.962
And when it was hooked up,
they realized it was a tape delay.

43:53.130 --> 43:54.756
So when you make one strum,

43:54.923 --> 43:58.509
it comes back at you
at the same time... chicka.

43:58.677 --> 44:01.512
And the other studios
hear chicka, chicka,

44:01.680 --> 44:04.182
and thought it was a guitar
making more sounds.

44:04.350 --> 44:07.727

actually developed out of an illusion.

the first instruments in music.

45:04.410 --> 45:07.412
So the drum is the heartbeat,

45:07.579 --> 45:09.914

I was working with a company
called National Dry Cleaners

46:40.380 --> 46:43.049
and l was in charge
of a branch.

46:43.217 --> 46:46.052
And Rita came in one day with some
clothes to...

46:46.220 --> 46:47.929
you know, to be dry-cleaned.

46:48.096 --> 46:51.474
She gave out the clothes
and she said, "Rita Marley."

46:51.642 --> 46:53.810
So l was quite surprised,

46:53.977 --> 46:56.854
because, l mean, the only Marley l know
was the white Marleys.

46:57.022 --> 46:58.773
I call them the white Marleys.

46:58.941 --> 47:02.109
And so I said, "Who is Marley?"

47:02.277 --> 47:04.737
She said, "Well,
that's my husband."

47:04.905 --> 47:06.739
And l said,
"Who is his father?"

47:06.907 --> 47:08.699
She said she don't know
much about him,

47:08.867 --> 47:10.368
but she know they call him
Captain Marley.

47:10.536 --> 47:12.495
And then l said,
"That's my father."

47:15.082 --> 47:17.708
My mother used to work
in a boardinghouse

47:17.876 --> 47:20.711
and my dad would stay there
when he comes from...

47:20.879 --> 47:24.757
from sea or wherever he goes,
and that's how she met him.

47:24.925 --> 47:27.760
Interviewer: And did they have a long
relationship or was it very brief?

47:27.928 --> 47:30.763
I think it was very brief.

47:30.931 --> 47:33.808
My mother didn't really know
what happened to him.

47:37.104 --> 47:40.064
McDonald: ln Jamaica, he used to
have a big company,

47:40.232 --> 47:42.441
established company
named Marley and Plant.

47:42.609 --> 47:45.027
They did construction,
Marley and Plant.

47:45.195 --> 47:48.781
Most of the construction jobs
in and around the country...

47:48.949 --> 47:51.784
that was the company
who did it.

47:51.952 --> 47:54.495
And he always said
those were his family.

47:54.663 --> 47:56.414
Yeah, l remember
one time, I think,

47:56.582 --> 48:00.084
him go to them to try to borrow
some money to buy a car,

48:00.252 --> 48:04.130
you know, so they can
deliver the records.

48:04.298 --> 48:06.799
And the story goes,
when he walked in the office,

48:06.967 --> 48:10.678
like the whole staff turned around
'cause he looked so much like them.

48:12.598 --> 48:14.807
They told us to go away.

48:14.975 --> 48:18.769
They know nothing
about Norval having a baby.

48:18.937 --> 48:22.189

48:22.357 --> 48:24.984
l don't know how strong
the word "rejected" is,

48:25.152 --> 48:28.988
but he might have
been rejected, for sure,

48:29.156 --> 48:32.199
because a different era

48:32.367 --> 48:34.201
and my father
was a disciplinarian,

48:34.369 --> 48:37.204
and he was quite a stern man
in his own way.

48:37.372 --> 48:42.251
In those days Rastafarians weren't as
socially accepted as they are now.

48:44.171 --> 48:47.757
He said to me, "When all this happened,
it gave me more strength"

48:47.925 --> 48:49.842
because l went
to write a song."

48:50.010 --> 48:51.969
You know, write a song.
I said, "What song?"

48:52.137 --> 48:53.763
He said, "Try to pick it up."

48:53.931 --> 48:55.056
He said, "The stone
the builder refuse."

48:55.223 --> 48:56.974
I'm the stone. I'm the one."

I had no doubt that it would succeed.

56:24.005 --> 56:25.756
I had no doubt.

56:25.924 --> 56:28.175
The only thing that
could stop it succeeding

56:28.343 --> 56:30.260
is if I couldn't
get them to tour.

They went on this famous tour,

56:40.563 --> 56:43.107
and things went wrong,
things went sour.

56:43.274 --> 56:47.152
We did a tour of England
of the "Catch a Fire" album,

56:47.320 --> 56:50.697
but no one told us that
it was a promotional tour

56:50.865 --> 56:53.826
so we wouldn't
be getting any money.

56:53.993 --> 56:55.953
Cole: You're a top group
in Jamaica now,

56:56.121 --> 56:58.497
and you probably think
that going to England

56:58.665 --> 57:00.332
is going to be the same.

57:00.500 --> 57:02.084
Bob was more real

57:02.252 --> 57:05.170
'cause he said to me,
"Eh, nobody know the Wailers."

57:05.338 --> 57:08.257
l think Bob recognized
he needed to get out there and do it,

57:08.425 --> 57:10.592
and l think the others
were not sure.

57:10.760 --> 57:12.886
It's like grassroots, you know?

57:13.054 --> 57:16.473
You're on a bus all night, schlepping
up and down the motorway,

57:16.641 --> 57:18.392
eating terrible food.

57:18.560 --> 57:20.561
You know, it's rough.

57:20.728 --> 57:23.105
In the case of Bunny,
l think he just didn't want

57:23.273 --> 57:24.690
to be in the cold and the snow.

57:24.858 --> 57:27.693
He just... it just wasn't
worth it to him.

57:31.156 --> 57:33.866
Danny: Bob wanted success.

57:34.033 --> 57:36.326
Bunny and Peter
were more militant.

57:36.494 --> 57:38.871
People wanted to separate them

57:39.038 --> 57:43.333
because they didn't want
to deal with Bunny and Peter.

57:43.501 --> 57:45.544
Interviewer: When you say people,
do you mean Island Records?

57:45.712 --> 57:47.212
Of course.

57:47.380 --> 57:49.882
The American leg was next.

57:50.049 --> 57:53.343
So l said, "Are we going to get
some money out of this leg?"

57:53.511 --> 57:58.474
Chris Blackwell said, "No, because
you're going to be doing freak clubs."

57:58.641 --> 58:02.644
You know, a place where all kinds
of immoral, mix-up, mix-up things...

58:02.812 --> 58:06.565
So l say, "Chris, you know
that we are Rastas."

58:06.733 --> 58:10.152
Why are you exposing us to
them kind of situations there?"

58:10.320 --> 58:13.572
"Well, if the Wailers
don't do those clubs, they're nobody."

58:13.740 --> 58:17.910
So I said, "Yeah?
So I'm not going on this tour."

58:18.077 --> 58:21.246
This leg, I'm coming off."

58:21.414 --> 58:23.415
And my brothers, l thought,
would have done the same

58:23.583 --> 58:26.168
as the conversation
affected them both,

58:26.336 --> 58:31.381
but l was left to look as if
l was the only cold front.

58:31.549 --> 58:36.261
So l hold my position anyway
and still hold my position.

McDonald:
Peter was a militant type of guy

59:04.207 --> 59:07.584
and l think he didn't like
Chris Blackwell too much.

59:07.752 --> 59:10.963
He figured Chris Blackwell
was ripping them off.

59:12.173 --> 59:14.508
Well, the time came about '74

59:14.676 --> 59:17.427
when we did two L.P.s
with Chris "Whitewell."

59:17.595 --> 59:20.722
And the way he intend
to handle us

59:20.890 --> 59:23.058
was like we were unprofessional

59:23.226 --> 59:27.062
or we were just beginners,
which l did not appreciate.

59:27.230 --> 59:31.149
But after 12 years of being
a background vocalist with the Wailers,

59:31.317 --> 59:33.986
l didn't get much
access of saying

59:34.153 --> 59:36.363
or materializing
what was in me.

59:36.531 --> 59:39.032
And that was totally
depreciating my ability.

59:39.200 --> 59:44.413
So l left because l need
recognition and respect.

59:55.091 --> 59:57.384

01:00:01.681 --> 01:00:05.767
Ziggy: For us as his children,
he wasn't like a lovey-dovey daddy

01:00:05.935 --> 01:00:08.478

01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:15.819

Him was rough, you know?

01:00:15.987 --> 01:00:17.654
Rough, rough, rough.

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:28.999
Cedella Marley:
We were always, like, active.

01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:30.417
You know, like,
we're on the beach.

01:00:30.585 --> 01:00:33.503
We're running.
We're racing each other.

01:00:33.671 --> 01:00:36.548
It was always about racing
to see who could beat him.

01:00:36.716 --> 01:00:38.550
Ziggy:
I mean, there was no letup in him.

01:00:38.718 --> 01:00:41.928
There was no, like, "lt's children.
Let me run slow."

01:00:42.096 --> 01:00:45.057
( whistles, laughs )

01:00:45.224 --> 01:00:48.560
The fastest he could run
against us, he'd run.

01:00:48.728 --> 01:00:50.395
And then he would
find it hilarious,

01:00:50.563 --> 01:00:52.648
and we didn't find it so funny.

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:58.487
Yeah, nobody wanted
their children around us.

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:04.076
"Nasty. Drug heads."

01:01:04.243 --> 01:01:08.121
AII your parents do
is smoke weed and play music.

01:01:08.289 --> 01:01:11.708
"And therefore, my kid
cannot play with you."

01:01:11.876 --> 01:01:14.670
So it wasn't a positive thing.

01:01:14.837 --> 01:01:17.506
I would have friends who... Iike,
basically if they want to sleep over,

01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:21.426
they would have to tell their parents
they were sleeping somewhere else.

01:01:21.594 --> 01:01:23.887
He said, "You don't
need friends."

01:01:24.055 --> 01:01:25.972
You have your brothers
and your sisters.

01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:29.601
And that's all you need.

01:01:29.769 --> 01:01:31.895

you'd need friends."

01:03:32.058 --> 01:03:35.101
the Lyceum...
that was the tipping point.

01:03:35.269 --> 01:03:38.271
After that,
everybody knew his name.

01:03:38.439 --> 01:03:42.734
There was that sense
that he's about to be massive.

01:03:48.407 --> 01:03:50.992
Firstly, it was packed,
overpacked.

01:03:53.913 --> 01:03:56.790
When you're at a concert

and there are X hundred people outside

01:03:59.293 --> 01:04:01.253
who can't get in,
you already feel great.

01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:05.090
And that energy you have spreads to
the band when they come onstage.

01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:07.759
And so they feel something.
And it was one of those things.

01:04:07.927 --> 01:04:10.846
It was just... just explosive.

01:04:11.013 --> 01:04:15.267
When he walked on stage and he felt
the crowd moving the theater,

01:04:15.434 --> 01:04:17.894

It was called lsland House.

01:05:05.151 --> 01:05:09.112
And he had several of his friends
and associates who really lived there.

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.907
Not like an apartment building,

Chris made this available
for Bob to rehearse.

01:05:19.332 --> 01:05:23.501
And eventually, over time,
Bob bought it from Chris.

01:05:23.669 --> 01:05:26.504
Well, Rastas weren't
allowed uptown,

01:05:26.672 --> 01:05:28.924
and, until Bob moved in,

01:05:29.091 --> 01:05:31.217
there were no dreadlocks there.

01:05:31.385 --> 01:05:33.053
Garrick: A woman said to Bob,

01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:35.597
"How come you live
at 56 Hope Road,"

01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:38.433
which is two doors up
from King's House

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:40.268

01:05:40.436 --> 01:05:42.771

"where the prime minister
lives?"

01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:49.361

l bring the ghetto uptown."

01:05:51.864 --> 01:05:54.366

01:05:54.533 --> 01:05:57.661
One of the people
who lived here prior to Bob

01:05:57.828 --> 01:05:59.829
was Cindy Breakspeare.

01:05:59.997 --> 01:06:03.208
And she lived there
with her brother Reds.

01:06:03.376 --> 01:06:05.293
I loved the accommodation

01:06:05.461 --> 01:06:07.545
because l loved the old house
with the wooden floors.

01:06:07.713 --> 01:06:10.006
And, you know,
it was just lovely.

01:06:10.174 --> 01:06:13.343

and just general carrying on.

01:06:26.691 --> 01:06:28.566
You were right in the mix.

01:06:28.734 --> 01:06:32.320
The most important thing culturally that
was happening in Jamaica at that time

01:06:32.488 --> 01:06:35.156
was happening right there.

01:06:35.324 --> 01:06:38.410
That was the headquarters.
That was the center of it all.

01:06:38.577 --> 01:06:41.079
Bob never left 56 Hope Road.

01:06:41.247 --> 01:06:43.999
People come from all over
the world to see him.

01:06:45.543 --> 01:06:47.460
Interviewer: Did you live at Hope Road
with your dad?

01:06:47.628 --> 01:06:50.588
No, we lived probably a couple
of miles from Hope Road.

01:06:50.756 --> 01:06:53.258
- Right.
- 'Cause Hope Road was really...

01:06:54.927 --> 01:06:57.053
l don't know. It was the spot.

01:06:58.597 --> 01:07:00.432

Rasta is an open-door thing.

Mowatt: Every time you go
to 56 Hope Road,

01:07:10.985 --> 01:07:13.403
you would see a lot of people
gather with Bob,

01:07:13.571 --> 01:07:16.156
reasoning,
talking about politics,

01:07:16.323 --> 01:07:19.951
talking about God,
talking about history...

01:07:20.119 --> 01:07:23.038
you know, talking about
everything.

01:07:23.205 --> 01:07:24.581

We call him "Skipper."

01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:33.214
You see, the thing is, we had certain
strict rules at that time.

01:07:33.382 --> 01:07:37.093
Woman supposed to
wear dress, not pants.

01:07:37.261 --> 01:07:38.678
So you had those kind...
don't come in

01:07:38.846 --> 01:07:42.932
with what we call war paint...
Iipstick and eye shadow.

01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:44.601
And this is a roots
saying kinda...

01:07:44.769 --> 01:07:46.186
if you wanna come round Rasta,

01:07:46.353 --> 01:07:49.272
then you have to throw away
those Babylonian things.

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:53.485
Breakspeare: lt was a camp with
rules and doctrines

01:07:53.652 --> 01:07:57.947
and tenets to live by,
and it was serious.

01:07:58.115 --> 01:08:01.826
Garrick: Bob was very, like,
health-conscious with him foods.

01:08:01.994 --> 01:08:05.705
Mowatt: The blender would always be
going with excellent juices.

01:08:05.873 --> 01:08:09.167
Irish moss on the fire,
fish tea going...

01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:11.836

to make you strong.

01:08:16.841 --> 01:08:19.594
Cole: When l met him,
we started a routine.

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:22.680
My routine was getting up
in the mornings, train,

01:08:22.848 --> 01:08:25.015
do a lot of running,
exercise, go to the beach.

01:08:25.184 --> 01:08:27.894
So it became
an integral part of our lifestyle.

01:08:28.062 --> 01:08:31.856
The whole Rasta thing
is based on eternal life

01:08:32.024 --> 01:08:33.483
and taking care of your body.

01:08:33.651 --> 01:08:35.777
It's the temple of the Lord.

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:38.113
And we'd run on the beach
and then up this mountain

01:08:38.279 --> 01:08:40.240
to a place called
Cane River Falls.

01:08:40.407 --> 01:08:41.866

You know, like small scrimmage.

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:24.658

"That's just a disguise for
saying you're a communist."

01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:11.626
Reporter: Sometimes it's only insults
or stones and bottles

01:17:11.793 --> 01:17:13.586
thrown from one side
to the other,

01:17:13.754 --> 01:17:15.588
but often it's bombs
and bullets,

01:17:15.756 --> 01:17:18.924
and almost every day
the newspapers carry fresh reports

01:17:19.092 --> 01:17:21.052
of the previous day's
killings in Kingston.

01:17:22.596 --> 01:17:25.723
Rita: The whole thing became
like a gangster thing.

01:17:25.891 --> 01:17:27.725
Political gangster.

01:17:27.893 --> 01:17:30.686
These were the guys
who kept things in line

01:17:30.854 --> 01:17:32.938
for the MPs, you know.

01:17:33.106 --> 01:17:35.274
So you find that in some areas,

01:17:35.442 --> 01:17:38.653
the real power is enforcers.

01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:41.447
You like this girl...
that's both of us.

01:17:41.615 --> 01:17:44.033
You like her and l like her.
We start a fight over her.

01:17:44.201 --> 01:17:45.409
It's just that.

01:17:45.577 --> 01:17:48.746
Him like PNP. You like JLP.

01:17:48.914 --> 01:17:50.706
You wanna fight for your PNP.

01:17:52.417 --> 01:17:54.835
Bob was friends
with all of those guys.

01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:58.339
AII of the bad guys from
the Labour Party was Bob friend.

01:17:58.507 --> 01:18:01.967
Likewise, all the bad guys
from the PNP.

01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:04.762
Smith: These are guys
that come from

01:18:04.930 --> 01:18:07.098
the same neighborhood
he grew up with.

01:18:07.265 --> 01:18:09.809
These are really bad guys.
( Iaughing )

01:18:09.976 --> 01:18:11.310
'Cause you might
see some guys, yeah,

01:18:11.478 --> 01:18:15.523
and then tomorrow you'd
take up the Jamaican paper,

01:18:15.691 --> 01:18:17.441
you'd see
the 10-most-wanted list...

01:18:17.609 --> 01:18:20.277
four of the guys
that were on it were dead.

01:18:20.445 --> 01:18:22.071
There are now five.
( laughing )

01:18:23.448 --> 01:18:25.449
Some of them actually
love the music, you know,

01:18:25.617 --> 01:18:28.452
but their main thing is, you know...
( laughing )

01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:31.122
warfare and badness, you know.

01:18:32.332 --> 01:18:34.458
( Bob speaking )

01:18:47.764 --> 01:18:50.307
Bob did a concert

01:18:50.475 --> 01:18:53.853
with Stevie Wonder in Jamaica,

01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:57.940
and they actually performed
two songs together.

01:18:58.108 --> 01:19:00.818
I think "Very Superstitious,"
which Bob knew,

01:19:00.986 --> 01:19:03.320
and "l Shot the Sheriff."

01:19:04.823 --> 01:19:07.616
♪ l shot the sheriff ♪

01:19:08.994 --> 01:19:13.122
♪ But l did not shoot
the deputy... ♪

01:19:14.875 --> 01:19:17.501
Garrick: Stevie made a gesture
by giving, I think,

01:19:17.669 --> 01:19:19.670
half of his pay for the show

01:19:19.838 --> 01:19:23.132
to the Salvation Army
blind school in Jamaica,

01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:26.677
and l think Bob
was moved by that.

01:19:26.845 --> 01:19:31.515
And Bob said, "Well,
we'll give a free concert."

01:19:31.683 --> 01:19:35.144
They took that idea
to Michael Manley,

01:19:35.312 --> 01:19:38.063
who was just down the road...
the prime minister...

01:19:38.231 --> 01:19:42.026
and they were, like,
enthused about it.

01:19:42.194 --> 01:19:45.029
Reporter: Bob Marley, the world's
leading exponent of reggae music,

01:19:45.197 --> 01:19:47.323
has agreed to appear
in a major free concert

01:19:47.491 --> 01:19:49.825
to be held for the benefit
of the Jamaican people

01:19:49.993 --> 01:19:51.869
in Kingston on Sunday,
December 5th.

01:19:52.037 --> 01:19:55.456
The announcement was made at a press
conference held at Jamaica House

01:19:55.624 --> 01:19:57.541
by Marley,
his manager Don Taylor,

01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:59.335
and the parliamentary
secretary in charge

01:19:59.503 --> 01:20:01.545
of cultural information,
Arnold Bertram.

01:20:01.713 --> 01:20:04.048
Blackwell: Well, l think he got
tricked into it,

01:20:04.216 --> 01:20:06.759
'cause he rang me and asked me
if l thought he should do the concert.

01:20:06.927 --> 01:20:08.928
And l said, "Well,
if it's the prime minister",

01:20:09.095 --> 01:20:11.555
then you're doing it
for the country.

01:20:11.723 --> 01:20:13.766
But if there's going to be
an election soon,

01:20:13.934 --> 01:20:17.061
"then you're doing it for him
rather than the country."

01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:20.689
Reporter: Two weeks following that
announcement on November 22nd,

01:20:20.857 --> 01:20:22.733
Jamaica's prime minister,
Michael Manley,

01:20:22.901 --> 01:20:26.070
called new general elections
for December 15th.

01:20:26.238 --> 01:20:29.824
Garrick: lf we knew that election
was going to happen

01:20:29.991 --> 01:20:32.743
in that space of time,
we'd have never done that concert.

01:20:33.745 --> 01:20:35.746
( Bob speaking )

01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:40.417
Interviewer:
So with the upcoming election,

01:20:40.585 --> 01:20:44.380
you don't really want to think about
or care who wins?

01:20:44.548 --> 01:20:45.923
( Bob speaking )

01:20:49.886 --> 01:20:52.263
Remember, Bob is becoming
very popular,

01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:55.057
and whoever side
Bob seems to be on,

01:20:55.225 --> 01:20:56.934
that's the side
people gonna be on.

01:20:57.102 --> 01:21:00.604
Hell, Bob had a lot of control
down there in Jamaica, man.

01:21:00.772 --> 01:21:03.274
And them politicians
didn't like that.

01:21:03.441 --> 01:21:05.943
Bob, I think,
had overexposed himself

01:21:06.111 --> 01:21:07.945
on the political side,

01:21:08.113 --> 01:21:11.657
and that was bound to draw
the anger of some others

01:21:11.825 --> 01:21:13.450
because he had friends
on both sides.

01:21:13.618 --> 01:21:16.620
The thing was, like,
you have to be on one side.

01:21:16.788 --> 01:21:18.455
You have to be on some side.

01:21:18.623 --> 01:21:21.834
You can't be in the middle,
or you can get hurt.

01:21:26.131 --> 01:21:28.924
Garrick: We'd feel a little
kind of tension,

01:21:29.092 --> 01:21:32.845
but, you know, the politics
kind of getting hot.

01:21:33.013 --> 01:21:35.639
Mowatt: There were people saying
that they heard

01:21:35.807 --> 01:21:39.310
that they were gonna
shoot up the concert.

01:21:39.477 --> 01:21:40.978
Kinsey:
People in the group, you know,

01:21:41.146 --> 01:21:44.315
the musicians
and The l-Threes...

01:21:44.482 --> 01:21:48.485
every day, as it would
get closer to this day of the concert,

01:21:48.653 --> 01:21:52.823
people was feeling hesitant
about doing it.

01:21:52.991 --> 01:21:55.367
They had a fear for it.

01:21:57.996 --> 01:22:01.248
Mowatt: Every night there would be
rehearsal at 56 Hope Road

01:22:01.416 --> 01:22:03.417
for the concert.

01:22:05.337 --> 01:22:07.588
Garrick:
We usually had two guys

01:22:07.756 --> 01:22:10.299
from equivalent
to the Secret Service.

01:22:10.467 --> 01:22:12.301
They call them
the Protective Service.

01:22:12.469 --> 01:22:15.512
They, like, protect
the prime minister and stuff.

01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:17.848
And they used to
come every night,

01:22:18.016 --> 01:22:20.851
but they never came that night.

01:22:21.019 --> 01:22:24.855
We had took a break, so everybody
was kind of floating around.

01:22:25.023 --> 01:22:28.817
Don Taylor, Bob, and myself

01:22:28.985 --> 01:22:32.446
was in the kitchen.

01:22:32.614 --> 01:22:35.950
I was in the car, you know,
getting ready to come out.

01:22:36.117 --> 01:22:38.869
I see some men
going up the steps.

01:22:39.037 --> 01:22:43.666
The gunman approached
from the side here

01:22:43.833 --> 01:22:47.211
and kind of pushed his gun
through here.

01:22:47.379 --> 01:22:50.589
Well, you see a black glove
with a gun in it pointing up,

01:22:50.757 --> 01:22:53.759
you know... there was
nowhere else to go in the kitchen

01:22:53.927 --> 01:22:56.095
'cause we just,
like, at the wall.

01:22:57.806 --> 01:23:00.557
And then l heard the gunshots.

01:23:01.768 --> 01:23:04.061
( Gunshots )

01:23:08.024 --> 01:23:11.527
- Then they turned the gun on the car.
- ( Gunshots )

01:23:11.695 --> 01:23:14.321
l felt the warmest of blood
running down,

01:23:14.489 --> 01:23:16.573
and then l realized l was shot.

01:23:16.741 --> 01:23:18.742
The cat just
kept on shooting, man,

01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:20.577
till he ran out of bullets.

01:23:20.745 --> 01:23:22.246
The one hold a gun to my head,

01:23:22.414 --> 01:23:24.456
and one said to the other one,
"Everybody dead?"

01:23:24.624 --> 01:23:27.251
And the other said, "Yeah, man,
everybody dead. Everybody dead."

01:23:27.419 --> 01:23:29.378
Next thing l see Don Taylor
come out, man,

01:23:29.546 --> 01:23:32.423
and, like, blood pouring out of him
like ketchup, man.

01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:35.551
And then he finally
collapsed right there on the floor.

01:23:35.719 --> 01:23:37.052
I'm, like, "Man!"

01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:39.763
And I'm shouting out for Bob,
and then I heard a voice

01:23:39.931 --> 01:23:42.641
who I recognized
as Carly Barrett coming from...

01:23:42.809 --> 01:23:44.768
he said, "Bob is all right."

01:23:46.104 --> 01:23:47.604
Bob is all right."

01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:51.942
He had a burn right...

01:23:52.110 --> 01:23:54.570
the bullet traveled right here

01:23:54.738 --> 01:23:56.697
and actually lodged in his arm.

01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:00.492
Kinsey:
It's just a miracle, man,

01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:02.828
that nobody died
from that, man.

01:24:02.996 --> 01:24:05.205
Interviewer: So, it wasn't really
a professional hit?

01:24:05.373 --> 01:24:07.249
Well, as professional
as Jamaica is.

01:24:07.417 --> 01:24:10.169
They watch a lot of movies.
( chuckles )

01:24:10.336 --> 01:24:12.629
( siren wailing )

01:24:12.797 --> 01:24:15.466
Reporter: Here now is a special
item of news.

01:24:15.633 --> 01:24:18.552
Entertainer and reggae star,
Bob Marley,

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:21.430
Rita Marley and the manager
of The Wailers, Don Taylor,

01:24:21.598 --> 01:24:24.099
are now patients
in the University Hospital

01:24:24.267 --> 01:24:25.809
after receiving gunshot wounds

01:24:25.977 --> 01:24:29.313
during a shooting
incident tonight.

01:24:34.944 --> 01:24:38.530
( Bob speaking )

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.918
That's one thing for sure...

01:24:51.086 --> 01:24:54.296
that they was trying to stop
that concert from happening.

01:24:54.464 --> 01:24:56.131
The whole thing about
whether the concert

01:24:56.299 --> 01:24:58.133
was gonna happen or not...
there was so much pressure.

01:24:58.301 --> 01:25:00.427
There was pressure
from everywhere.

01:25:00.595 --> 01:25:02.846
I was just scared
Bob would get assassinated.

01:25:07.018 --> 01:25:08.852
Reporter:
In the twilight inside the arena,

01:25:09.020 --> 01:25:10.562
the crowd is fenced off

01:25:10.730 --> 01:25:12.147
and armed police are positioned

01:25:12.315 --> 01:25:14.233
all around the park.

01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:16.693
Five hours after the concert
was due to begin,

01:25:16.861 --> 01:25:20.364
the star, Bob Marley,
is still not there.

01:25:20.532 --> 01:25:23.283
Jobson: Some were trying to say,
"Bob, don't go.

01:25:23.451 --> 01:25:26.453
They didn't get you.
They may try for you again."

01:25:26.621 --> 01:25:29.957
Everyone saying, "You really
wanna do it, boss?"

01:25:30.125 --> 01:25:32.042
And him saying...
he said, "Yes."

01:25:32.210 --> 01:25:34.711
I said, "Hey, you know,
I'm with you, man."

01:25:34.879 --> 01:25:36.213
If you wanna do it,
let's do it."

01:25:36.381 --> 01:25:38.882
Mowatt: The police came for him
and took him down,

01:25:39.050 --> 01:25:42.386
and we were in the car
right behind the police vehicle.

01:25:42.554 --> 01:25:46.181
( Crowd shouting, cheering )

01:25:48.226 --> 01:25:49.601
Kinsey: When l got there,

01:25:49.769 --> 01:25:53.355
I couldn't believe
the situation, man.

01:25:53.523 --> 01:25:55.732
This is at night in Kingston.

01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:59.236
You got, like, 80,000 people, man.
You know what l mean?

01:25:59.404 --> 01:26:03.407
If somebody wanted to try to get you,
here's, like, a perfect situation.

01:26:03.575 --> 01:26:05.450
( Crowd cheering )

01:26:11.749 --> 01:26:14.459
But it was a special night, man.
It was a special moment, man.

01:26:14.627 --> 01:26:16.295
Woman: Come on, people!

01:26:16.462 --> 01:26:19.882
We got a band to see
play tonight.

01:26:20.049 --> 01:26:22.301
Come on! ( Shouts )

01:26:22.468 --> 01:26:24.803
( Jobson speaking )

01:26:24.971 --> 01:26:26.930
Whoo!

01:26:31.853 --> 01:26:33.896
- Bob: Yeah.
- ( Band playing )

01:26:36.316 --> 01:26:38.066
Mowatt: Bob was not afraid.

01:26:38.234 --> 01:26:41.195
Bob knew that
if anything happens

01:26:41.362 --> 01:26:43.447
while he's doing his work,

01:26:43.615 --> 01:26:45.908
he know that the Almighty God
is protect him.

problems with his toe.

01:35:31.267 --> 01:35:34.227
Somebody stepped on it
with their spike boots...

01:35:35.938 --> 01:35:38.898
and then it started
to get infested

01:35:39.066 --> 01:35:41.776

still play football the next day on it...

01:35:54.415 --> 01:35:56.249
of melanoma.

01:35:56.417 --> 01:35:59.085
And they test it
and they found out that

01:35:59.253 --> 01:36:03.131
that was more like a white person
sort of sickness.

01:36:03.299 --> 01:36:05.091
It wasn't coming
from a black source.

01:36:05.259 --> 01:36:09.763
It was the whiteness
in him that allowed it to get this bad.

01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:13.475
Interviewer: What did they recommend
he should do about it?

01:36:13.642 --> 01:36:16.936
They recommended
disarticulation at the hip.

01:36:17.104 --> 01:36:19.814
In other words,
remove the entire leg.

01:36:19.982 --> 01:36:21.316
Interviewer:
The doctor in England

01:36:21.484 --> 01:36:23.443
told him he had to cut
his whole leg off.

01:36:23.611 --> 01:36:26.529
- Was that... do you remember that?
- No.

01:36:26.697 --> 01:36:29.365
Had to cut off his... his toe.

01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:32.660
It was definitely not his leg.

01:36:32.828 --> 01:36:37.165
A lot of people told Bob
that once you cut your toe off...

01:36:37.333 --> 01:36:40.168
your big toe especially...
you won't be able to dance anymore.

01:36:40.336 --> 01:36:45.507
He loved football,
so l think the thought

01:36:45.674 --> 01:36:48.593
of having his toe amputated
was just unacceptable to him.

01:36:48.761 --> 01:36:52.680
So, this other doctor
we saw in Miami said,

01:36:52.848 --> 01:36:54.599
"No, it's not necessary."

01:36:54.767 --> 01:36:58.061
We can just take off
a portion of it.

01:36:58.229 --> 01:36:59.687
You don't have to remove
the whole toe.

01:36:59.855 --> 01:37:02.899
You can just take off
the whole nail bed, and you know,

01:37:03.067 --> 01:37:04.859

01:39:01.727 --> 01:39:05.271
So they got one of their main leader,
Claudie Massop,

01:39:05.439 --> 01:39:08.149
to speak to Bob.

01:39:08.317 --> 01:39:10.985
This guy, he was from
the other side of the party...

01:39:11.153 --> 01:39:12.820
Claudie Massop.

01:39:12.988 --> 01:39:15.031
And the next one
named Tek-Life.

01:39:15.199 --> 01:39:17.784
I don't remember his right name,
but we call him Tek-Life.

01:39:17.952 --> 01:39:21.496
They went up to England
to pursue Bob to come down,

01:39:21.664 --> 01:39:23.456
back to Jamaica.

01:39:23.624 --> 01:39:25.833
Bob sent for them, in a way,

01:39:26.001 --> 01:39:29.837
to come up, and so they would be on...
away from Jamaica,

01:39:30.005 --> 01:39:31.839
away from that
political influence,

01:39:32.007 --> 01:39:34.676
and they could reason
among themselves.

01:39:34.843 --> 01:39:38.721
Welch: The two guys who went up there
for him was on the opposition.

01:39:38.889 --> 01:39:40.807
So l would represent
the other side.

01:39:40.975 --> 01:39:43.184
So if he say, "l don't come,"

01:39:43.352 --> 01:39:45.937
then he ain't coming back
to Jamaica.

01:39:46.105 --> 01:39:49.023
So l have to go to England.

01:39:52.111 --> 01:39:56.155
Interviewer: Of those people,
how many are still alive?

01:39:57.449 --> 01:39:59.283
One...

01:39:59.451 --> 01:40:01.202

"We, Jah people, shall come together
and make it work."

01:40:27.688 --> 01:40:29.022
Then they decided
to have a concert.

01:40:29.189 --> 01:40:30.940
They'd just have
a peace concert.

01:40:31.108 --> 01:40:32.859
Last month a truce was arranged

01:40:33.027 --> 01:40:36.237
between the rival political factions
in Kingston, Jamaica.

01:40:36.405 --> 01:40:39.991
A peace conference was arranged
to be preceded by a peace concert

01:40:40.159 --> 01:40:42.160
for the people
in a very large park.

01:40:42.327 --> 01:40:44.829
They expect over
100,000 people there.

01:40:44.997 --> 01:40:48.541
Bob Marley was invited to headline
this peace concert.

01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:50.626
Marley has accepted

01:40:50.794 --> 01:40:53.588
and will return
to Kingston, Jamaica.

01:40:53.756 --> 01:40:55.757
Bob, why are you
returning to Jamaica?

01:40:55.924 --> 01:40:57.800
Well, my life
not important to me,

01:40:57.968 --> 01:40:59.761

01:41:29.333 --> 01:41:32.376
they jumped over the barriers
and ran towards the plane,

01:41:32.544 --> 01:41:35.254

02:02:57.286 --> 02:03:00.246
Eddie: The next day, we were out
in Central Park jogging.

02:03:00.414 --> 02:03:03.124
And we was going up this hill,

02:03:03.292 --> 02:03:06.920
and all of a sudden he...
he stumbled.

02:03:07.088 --> 02:03:10.632
And we went and we laid him down
on the side of the trail,

02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:12.467
and he... he started shaking,

02:03:12.635 --> 02:03:14.928
and he had foaming
at the mouth.

02:03:15.096 --> 02:03:18.473
And l said... when l looked at him,
he looked real strange.

02:03:18.641 --> 02:03:22.685
And the guys gathered around him,
they said something in patois.

02:03:22.853 --> 02:03:25.980
And he hollered "Rastafari"
and jumped up off the ground.

02:03:26.148 --> 02:03:29.109
Scared me to death. I mean, he was
there, shaking and foaming.

02:03:29.276 --> 02:03:31.486
Next thing l know, he done...
he just jumped up.

02:03:34.532 --> 02:03:37.659
Danny: We took him to the hospital
next door to my house.

02:03:39.036 --> 02:03:41.871
The doctor told Allan and me

02:03:42.039 --> 02:03:46.126
that Bob Marley had cancer
and that it had spread.

02:03:46.293 --> 02:03:49.671
He had cancer
all over his body...

02:03:49.839 --> 02:03:53.174
lungs, brain,
all over the place.

02:03:53.342 --> 02:03:56.845
It was incredible that he was able
to keep working.

02:03:58.472 --> 02:04:02.559
Danny: But the doctor told us
that we shouldn't do anything,

02:04:02.726 --> 02:04:06.187
that we should just let him
stay on the concert tour,

02:04:06.355 --> 02:04:08.523
that he was so strong
and powerful,

02:04:08.691 --> 02:04:12.694
that one day he was gonna walk out
onstage and he was gonna fall dead.

02:04:13.821 --> 02:04:16.364
But that he could not
be treated

02:04:16.532 --> 02:04:18.658
and he could not be helped.

02:04:20.077 --> 02:04:21.828
Interviewer:
How did he take the news?

02:04:21.996 --> 02:04:25.206
Bad. He took the news bad.

02:04:28.335 --> 02:04:30.795
Blackwell: l knew he'd had a problem
with his toe before that,

02:04:30.963 --> 02:04:35.592
but l had forgotten about it.

02:04:35.759 --> 02:04:38.011
I think everybody seemed
to have forgotten about it

02:04:38.179 --> 02:04:42.056
because if he'd been going
to regular checkups,

02:04:42.224 --> 02:04:46.769
you know, he might have been...
he might be around today. But...

02:04:46.937 --> 02:04:48.354
lnterviewer:
He just didn't go to his checkups?

02:04:48.522 --> 02:04:50.231
No.

02:04:58.616 --> 02:05:01.868
Mowatt:
The next stop was Pittsburgh,

02:05:02.036 --> 02:05:05.955
and we were waiting for Bob
to come on the bus

02:05:06.123 --> 02:05:08.625
for all of us
to drive to Pittsburgh.

02:05:08.792 --> 02:05:10.585
And we never saw Bob.

02:05:13.714 --> 02:05:15.924
Finally, he arrived,

02:05:16.091 --> 02:05:19.093
and he was looking
very, very stressed, l remember,

02:05:19.261 --> 02:05:22.597
and we went to do
a sound check.

02:05:22.765 --> 02:05:26.643
And I remember
we did the sound check

02:05:26.810 --> 02:05:28.728
with one song

02:05:28.896 --> 02:05:32.273
and we did that song
for maybe two or three hours.

02:05:32.441 --> 02:05:34.359
"I'm Hurting lnside."

02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:38.947
Mowatt: lt's the longest sound check
we have ever had.

02:05:39.114 --> 02:05:44.077
It just felt like, "Why?"
We didn't understand.

02:05:49.458 --> 02:05:52.043
We had a meeting before the show,
half an hour before the show,

02:05:52.211 --> 02:05:56.130
and we were told by Allan Cole
that this was gonna be our last concert.

02:05:57.466 --> 02:06:01.010
And, of course, we were all,
like, in shock.

02:06:01.178 --> 02:06:03.054
Cole: Before we went onstage,
he said to me,

02:06:03.222 --> 02:06:06.474
"l want you to stay pretty close in case
anything should happen."

02:06:06.642 --> 02:06:09.519
I'm saying, "Nothing's gonna happen to
you. Everything's gonna be all right."

02:06:09.687 --> 02:06:11.938
But he just said,
"Stay close in case."

02:06:12.106 --> 02:06:14.357
Just in case he got a seizure.

Eddie: He put on the show,
but it wasn't the same.

02:06:24.410 --> 02:06:26.578
He didn't have the same energy.

02:06:26.745 --> 02:06:29.747
But the people kept him
pumped up 'cause this...

02:06:29.915 --> 02:06:31.374
so many people in the audience,

02:06:31.542 --> 02:06:33.501

"Lord, l wonder
if he can do it."

02:06:40.342 --> 02:06:43.511

and I'm saying, "Jesus, l wonder

02:06:54.940 --> 02:06:58.443
But he did it. He did it.

And that was the last time

02:07:01.155 --> 02:07:03.197

Jaffe: I was with him
the whole time in New York

02:07:34.063 --> 02:07:35.772
when he was being treated
at Sloan-Kettering.

02:07:35.939 --> 02:07:37.649
I was with him every day.

02:07:37.816 --> 02:07:42.570
I was with him when he was getting
chemo and his locks fell out.

02:07:45.908 --> 02:07:48.159
Breakspeare: The weight of the locks
was just too heavy.

02:07:48.327 --> 02:07:50.244
The few hairs that were still holding

02:07:50.412 --> 02:07:51.746
was beginning to be really
uncomfortable,

02:07:51.914 --> 02:07:53.748
and he decided to cut it.

02:07:53.916 --> 02:07:55.792
That was quite a night.

02:07:58.420 --> 02:08:02.090
It was myself, Rita...
a group of us women.

02:08:02.257 --> 02:08:05.593
We lit candles, and we were reading
from the Bible.

02:08:05.761 --> 02:08:08.096
We were reading
the "Book of Job,"

02:08:08.263 --> 02:08:11.641
and we cut.

02:08:11.809 --> 02:08:14.268
I said to him...

02:08:16.313 --> 02:08:18.690
"You going for
the Rude Boy look?"

02:08:18.857 --> 02:08:20.858
And he laughed. It was funny.

02:08:21.026 --> 02:08:22.944
But it was really,
really sad...

02:08:23.112 --> 02:08:25.822
the saddest thing
l can ever remember.

02:08:28.158 --> 02:08:30.159
That was the first time
l saw him...

02:08:32.454 --> 02:08:34.539
like, without his hair.

02:08:34.707 --> 02:08:37.333
You know, he looked,
like, so tiny.

02:08:57.646 --> 02:09:00.982
Fraser: Him say, "Listen, we're
gonna fight it, all right?"

02:09:01.150 --> 02:09:04.485
Regardless of what the doctors might say
or what they might do,

02:09:04.653 --> 02:09:06.779
we're gonna fight it,

02:09:06.947 --> 02:09:08.823
"'cause a Rasta never give up."

02:09:08.991 --> 02:09:11.576
Left to me, l would have said,

02:09:11.744 --> 02:09:14.996
"Bob, come home to St. Ann and come eat
roast fish and callaloo every day."

02:09:15.164 --> 02:09:16.873
Smoke the biggest spliff
if you like,

02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:21.085
drink fish tea,
just do what you want.

02:09:21.253 --> 02:09:24.005
And if you end up in the same place
at the end of it all,

02:09:24.173 --> 02:09:28.050
at least you will
have had some comfort

02:09:28.218 --> 02:09:29.844

on this earth

02:09:30.012 --> 02:09:33.181
"and being in a place that you really,
really wanted to be in."

02:09:33.348 --> 02:09:36.142
But we girls didn't have
much talk in those days, you know.

02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:38.686

Breakspeare: He was living in a house
just down the road.

02:10:45.420 --> 02:10:48.130
It was actually in walking distance
from the clinic.

02:10:48.298 --> 02:10:49.966
But l mean, you had
to put boots on

02:10:50.133 --> 02:10:52.260
halfway up your thigh
to get through the snow.

02:10:54.137 --> 02:10:56.305
Garrick: I'm telling you,
I had to wear dark glasses

02:10:56.473 --> 02:10:58.307
because it was so white.

02:10:58.475 --> 02:11:00.810
The lake was frozen
three feet deep.

02:11:00.978 --> 02:11:03.437
You could drive a car over it.

02:11:03.605 --> 02:11:07.817
I said, "This is a fridge
where they keep people alive."

02:11:07.985 --> 02:11:10.778
No, Rottach-Egern...
l'll never forget that.

02:11:12.281 --> 02:11:15.533
Fraser:
Dr. Josef lssels was the ultimate

02:11:15.701 --> 02:11:18.202
in holistic therapy
at that time.

02:11:18.370 --> 02:11:20.538
But what made him more interesting...
he was the only doctor

02:11:20.706 --> 02:11:24.917
who had actually cured a melanoma
on the planet Earth.

02:11:26.128 --> 02:11:29.005
( Speaking German )

02:12:07.002 --> 02:12:11.505
I went to Germany
for his 36th birthday.

02:12:12.674 --> 02:12:15.509
Rita was there.
Cindy was there.

02:12:15.677 --> 02:12:17.678
His mom was there.

02:12:19.097 --> 02:12:21.349
It was kind of frustrating
in a sense

02:12:21.516 --> 02:12:25.686
because I know
the type of person Bob is.

02:12:25.854 --> 02:12:29.190
Him didn't want us
to see him in that state.

02:12:30.734 --> 02:12:34.236
Bob had a stroke, l think,
on the left side.

02:12:34.404 --> 02:12:39.033
So he was frustrated that
he couldn't finger a guitar.

02:12:39.201 --> 02:12:40.284
Interviewer:
So when you left him,

02:12:40.452 --> 02:12:42.161
you thought he might
get better?

02:12:42.329 --> 02:12:45.539
Yeah. I was definitely hoping...
well, he was trying to tell me that...

02:12:45.707 --> 02:12:49.168
that he's gonna beat
this thing, you know?

02:12:49.336 --> 02:12:51.671
"I'll beat this thing."

02:12:52.839 --> 02:12:55.049
( Bob speaking )

02:13:16.571 --> 02:13:19.573
( speaking German )

02:13:34.256 --> 02:13:37.925
Danny: l think people then started
going after his wealth.

02:13:38.093 --> 02:13:40.553
I think that it was...
it had become

02:13:40.721 --> 02:13:43.764
a bloodthirsty-type situation

02:13:43.932 --> 02:13:47.601
where people knew
he was gonna die,

02:13:47.769 --> 02:13:50.563
and they was just...

02:13:50.731 --> 02:13:53.024
they just surrounded him.

02:13:55.360 --> 02:13:58.654
That's why Bob never write
a will, l feel.

02:13:58.822 --> 02:14:01.115
Bob never want to give up.

02:14:01.283 --> 02:14:03.534
It seems like when you write a will,
it's like you say,

02:14:03.702 --> 02:14:06.871
"Well, you know,
I'm checking in."

02:14:08.832 --> 02:14:10.624
So I think that was
one of the reasons.

02:14:10.792 --> 02:14:13.878
I think one of the reasons, too, is he's
not the type of person who would say,

02:14:14.046 --> 02:14:17.715
"Now, okay, l leave this
for Ziggy, Cedella."

02:14:17.883 --> 02:14:21.469
You know, like, divide up. And "Okay,
what should I leave for Seeco"

02:14:21.636 --> 02:14:24.638
and Neville and Carly and..."

02:14:24.806 --> 02:14:26.557
That's not Bob.

02:14:26.725 --> 02:14:30.102
Where the Bob I know,
by leaving it open like that,

02:14:30.270 --> 02:14:34.023
everybody reveal
who they really were.

02:14:34.191 --> 02:14:36.525
- You get me?
- Interviewer: Hmm.

02:14:36.693 --> 02:14:39.945
Who really did love him,
who fighting over the money.

02:14:40.113 --> 02:14:42.490
Yeah, man. Him does say,
but that's how he is.

02:14:42.657 --> 02:14:44.825
Bob left it open.

02:14:48.038 --> 02:14:50.122
Jobson: The doctor said that

02:14:50.290 --> 02:14:52.917
he couldn't do
anything more for Bob,

02:14:53.085 --> 02:14:54.627
and if we were going to leave,

02:14:54.795 --> 02:14:58.964
we'd have to do it
within 48 hours.

02:14:59.132 --> 02:15:00.966
So I said, "I'm on my way back."

02:15:01.134 --> 02:15:03.177
I'm coming back

02:15:03.345 --> 02:15:05.513
And he said, "No, don't come."

02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:07.723
He's coming to Miami.

02:15:07.891 --> 02:15:11.018
We decided, you know, that...

02:15:11.186 --> 02:15:14.480
we'd just rent a plane,
you know.

02:15:14.648 --> 02:15:16.899
Bob wanted to know
if it's a Concorde.

02:15:17.067 --> 02:15:19.527
I said, "No. ( Laughing )"

02:15:19.694 --> 02:15:22.196
No Concorde."

02:15:33.959 --> 02:15:37.336
Rita: So l brought up all the kids
from... who was in Jamaica.

02:15:37.504 --> 02:15:41.215
Some of them my kids,
some from other mothers.

02:15:41.383 --> 02:15:44.718
So I gathered everyone and said,
"Come. Daddy want to see you all."

02:15:44.886 --> 02:15:47.096
l remember me and Ziggy
were sitting outside,

02:15:47.264 --> 02:15:50.891
and some preacher guy
came from Jamaica,

02:15:51.059 --> 02:15:54.478
another one came
from the Ethiopian Church,

02:15:54.646 --> 02:15:57.898
and I'm telling Ziggy, "Ziggy,
he's gonna be all right, you know?"

02:15:58.066 --> 02:16:00.067
'Cause, l mean, look...
look how many people are praying."

02:16:00.235 --> 02:16:04.488
My memory was going
to the intensive care unit,

02:16:04.656 --> 02:16:06.740
doing peep, going like this,

02:16:06.908 --> 02:16:09.994
looking through the window,
you know, like, going...

02:16:10.162 --> 02:16:12.997
And him lay down there,
and him kind of see me, and him go...

02:16:13.165 --> 02:16:14.915
him go, "Come."

02:16:15.083 --> 02:16:18.919
So l went in, l went beside him,
and him say, you know,

02:16:19.087 --> 02:16:22.298
"What up, young Bob?"
You know, "What's up, young Bob?"

02:16:22.465 --> 02:16:25.718
And, "Me have a song for you."

02:16:25.886 --> 02:16:28.512
You know, him say,
"l have a song for you."

02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:30.890
And him sing a couple
of lines of the song,

02:16:31.057 --> 02:16:32.308
"On your way up, take me up.

02:16:32.475 --> 02:16:34.101
On your way down,
don't let me down."

02:16:36.813 --> 02:16:39.857
You know, like the one time
you're kinda hoping

02:16:40.025 --> 02:16:43.693
