00:05.839 --> 00:06.924
You understand how this works?

00:07.216 --> 00:09.092
NEAL: Yeah, I'm being released
into the custody of the FBI

00:09.176 --> 00:10.177
under your supervision.

00:10.260 --> 00:12.012
PETER: This is a temporary situation.

Help me catch the Dutchman,
you can make it permanent.

-Ellen.

You and your father.

NEAL: My mom told me he was dead.
But you told me the truth.

00:34.952 --> 00:37.037
He was a dirty cop, and he's not dead.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.664
You grew up in Witness Protection.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.374
I was three when the marshals
took us away.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.251
-What happened?
-ELLEN: They found a gun.

00:42.334 --> 00:43.418
With his prints on it.

00:43.502 --> 00:45.420
-He killed a cop?
-He confessed.

<i>There are dirty cops.</i>

00:53.720 --> 00:55.097
PETER: Senator Terrence Pratt.

00:55.180 --> 00:57.641
He's got to be one of the dirty
cops Ellen was investigating.

00:57.724 --> 00:58.767
He's the one.

00:58.851 --> 01:00.269
NEAL: We found the evidence box.

01:01.770 --> 01:02.980
After all these years.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.024
That box belongs to Senator Pratt.

PRATT: Where is it?

01:07.234 --> 01:09.111
-Where's what?
-The evidence!

-What'd you do, Dad?
-It was self-defense.

01:28.130 --> 01:30.507
You're gonna testify,
and you're gonna clear Peter's name.

01:30.883 --> 01:31.925
I can't do it.

01:52.321 --> 01:54.865
The irony of this is not lost on me.

This is my fault.

01:58.869 --> 01:59.870
My father is…

01:59.953 --> 02:03.040
You can't take responsibility
for what James did.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.750
He has completely disappeared.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.711
-Without his confession…
-I know.

02:07.794 --> 02:11.715
There was gunshot residue on my hands,
my prints on the gun,

02:11.798 --> 02:13.175
and no eye witnesses.

02:13.258 --> 02:14.968
I would've arrested me.

02:15.260 --> 02:16.470
Justice will prevail.

02:17.721 --> 02:19.139
Let's damn well hope so.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.644
I have some news to cheer you up.

02:24.520 --> 02:26.688
Federal prosecutor is dropping charges?

02:26.772 --> 02:27.856
No, not that good.

02:28.982 --> 02:29.983
Diana's pregnant.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.652
But how?

02:31.860 --> 02:34.071
She decided to do it on her own.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.031
She's actually pretty far along.

Hi, hon.

02:49.044 --> 02:51.463
I hate for you to see me like this.

02:51.880 --> 02:55.634
What I see is a man who's
gonna come back even stronger.

02:56.885 --> 02:58.971
You're gonna beat this, Peter Burke.

02:59.054 --> 03:00.681
You're gonna come home to me.

03:00.889 --> 03:03.559
I will. I promise.

03:06.979 --> 03:09.523
Neal, it's been six weeks.

03:09.940 --> 03:12.943
I don't think I can take another day,
much less years.

03:13.777 --> 03:16.280
-The indictment hearing starts tomorrow.
-I know.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.407
But that only decides if he goes to trial.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.367
If he's indicted,

03:20.450 --> 03:23.704
even if he's found innocent,
he can never serve as an FBI agent again.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.372
I don't care about his career.

03:25.789 --> 03:28.041
All I care about
is getting him out of there.

03:28.250 --> 03:29.793
I understand that, but…

03:30.460 --> 03:32.963
You care. That's right. Of course.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.632
Because this job is what's keeping you
from joining him in prison.

03:38.093 --> 03:41.722
-I'm sorry, Neal. That was wrong.
-That's okay.

03:43.432 --> 03:44.933
Peter cares.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.644
And I can't be responsible
for taking away his badge.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.521
That's why I want to clear him
before the indictment.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.607
Get him home to you as soon as possible.

03:52.024 --> 03:53.442
Do we have any options?

03:53.525 --> 03:57.070
We do, but they mostly involve you two
living under new identities in Alaska.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.156
Anything less nuclear?

03:59.948 --> 04:00.991
Not yet.

04:01.158 --> 04:04.036
Well I've always wanted to
drive a snowmobile to work, so.

04:07.956 --> 04:10.042
Do whatever you have to do, okay?

04:10.501 --> 04:11.752
Okay.

A-ha!

04:24.640 --> 04:25.641

04:25.724 --> 04:27.684
Unless you found a way to get
Peter out of jail,

04:27.768 --> 04:28.852
I don't want to hear about it.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.270
It's a step in that direction.

04:30.354 --> 04:32.272
I cracked your anklet.

04:32.523 --> 04:33.565
What?

04:33.649 --> 04:36.652
This fine piece of technology
took nine months

04:36.735 --> 04:38.237
and most of your wine cabinet,

04:38.445 --> 04:41.990
but because of this,
the FBI will no longer know where you are.

04:42.074 --> 04:43.825
You spent almost a year working on this?

04:43.909 --> 04:45.744
It was supposed to be a surprise.

04:45.827 --> 04:48.997
And for us to take a road trip
to the Jersey Shore.

04:49.081 --> 04:52.042
But a prison break is second best.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.794
Moz, this is great.

04:53.877 --> 04:56.046
But how are we going to convince
Peter to break out of prison?

04:56.129 --> 04:57.214
Who says we have to convince him?

04:57.297 --> 04:58.549
What, are you going to carry him out?

04:58.632 --> 05:01.051
I don't have
the upper-body strength, sadly.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.053
But we could douse him
with Devil's Breath.

05:03.136 --> 05:06.014
-We are not dousing him with anything.

05:07.224 --> 05:09.142
Did you tell anyone we were
trying to help Peter?

05:09.226 --> 05:11.311
And admit to assisting a suit?

05:11.395 --> 05:13.438
My reputation would never recover. Why?

05:13.730 --> 05:15.399
Because I didn't either.

05:47.806 --> 05:49.391
That it has.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.226
And you never sent me a thank you card.

05:51.894 --> 05:54.938
It's because of me you're free
to walk around Manhattan.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.441
That thing around your ankle.

05:57.608 --> 05:59.193
It's because I caught you.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.988
Nevertheless.

06:03.197 --> 06:06.033
I was unable to negotiate the same deal.

06:06.116 --> 06:08.410
So you settled for a work release program.

06:08.660 --> 06:10.954
I thought murderers were
a high security risk.

06:11.121 --> 06:13.373
I was never arrested for murder.

06:13.790 --> 06:14.958
Only forgery.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.084
Ah.

06:16.376 --> 06:21.048
It appears that there's a demand
for world-renowned restorers

06:21.131 --> 06:24.635
who can work for $10 a day,
even if it does require an armed escort.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.471
Are they guarding you,
or guarding for you?

(CHUCKLES) Bit of both, Caffrey.
You know how it goes.

06:31.642 --> 06:33.769
Little bribery goes a long way.

06:33.936 --> 06:35.812
Not long enough to let you go.

06:35.979 --> 06:39.149
Sadly, no. As you well know.

06:39.608 --> 06:42.277
Otherwise, you would've secured
Peter Burke's release.

06:42.361 --> 06:43.862
What's your offer?

06:44.321 --> 06:47.616
Pal up with him in prison? Protect him?

06:47.699 --> 06:50.202
That's not particularly big picture now,
is it?

06:51.745 --> 06:54.790
I know how to make Peter Burke
a free man.

07:18.897 --> 07:20.691

If there were a way to free Peter,
I would have found it.

07:23.402 --> 07:26.196
You have a federal prosecutor
breathing rather heavily

07:26.280 --> 07:28.907
down Peter Burke's neck, do you not?

07:29.491 --> 07:30.492
We do.

07:30.826 --> 07:32.995
What if I told you I was the reason

07:33.078 --> 07:35.080
he was so very determined

07:35.163 --> 07:37.124
to take Peter Burke down?

07:37.624 --> 07:39.001
If you had that kind of pull,

07:39.084 --> 07:41.170
I'd ask why you didn't use him
to get yourself out.

07:41.253 --> 07:42.546
Would that I could.

07:42.629 --> 07:46.508
Sadly he became a federal prosecutor
after I was incarcerated.

07:47.759 --> 07:50.929
I believe my patience has paid off
in other ways, though.

07:52.222 --> 07:53.515
What do you want?

07:53.599 --> 07:55.100
I want you to do me a favor.

07:55.184 --> 07:57.019
I need money, soon.

07:57.102 --> 07:58.729
You can afford to bribe guards.

07:58.937 --> 08:01.315
I'm in need of a much bigger sum.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.358
Already have a target.

Simple little smash and grab.
I'd do it myself, but…

08:11.033 --> 08:13.744
If you can pull this off,

08:14.077 --> 08:15.120
we have a deal.

08:16.914 --> 08:18.457
There's one more thing.

08:19.041 --> 08:20.334
There always is.

08:20.792 --> 08:24.838
Federal prosecutor's gonna
need a good reason to step away.

08:24.922 --> 08:26.048
Not lose face.

08:26.423 --> 08:27.883
You want me to provide that reason?

08:28.175 --> 08:31.094
Your old man's confession
should do quite nicely.

08:32.304 --> 08:35.432
If I could find my father,
Peter would already be free.

08:35.516 --> 08:36.558
Indeed.

08:36.642 --> 08:37.893
But from one forger to another,

08:37.976 --> 08:42.022
we both know there are many ways
to create another man's words.

08:42.606 --> 08:44.942
You want me to forge
my father's confession?

08:45.025 --> 08:48.070
Make it good. I'll take care of the rest.

So the Dutchman appears
out of nowhere offering gifts,

09:06.672 --> 09:07.965

You're not alone.
But what other choice do we have?

09:10.467 --> 09:13.095
-Like I said, we can…
-That doesn't involve a sky hook.

09:13.178 --> 09:15.973
Moz, this is the only option we've found
that doesn't have Peter on the run.

09:16.473 --> 09:20.143
I can make
a believable facsimile of James's voice,

09:20.477 --> 09:22.980
there is one catch.

and voice that will be very helpful.

09:37.661 --> 09:40.289
In spite of everything,
he's still my father.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.750
If I record this, he'll be a fugitive
for the rest of his life.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.086
Neal, James did that all by himself.

You're offering redemption
that he doesn't deserve.

09:50.716 --> 09:53.719
Do you have any recording of him?

09:53.844 --> 09:56.013
-I'll need it for voice matching.
-Yeah.

09:56.096 --> 09:59.099
He left me a voice mail right before
the con at the Empire State Building.

10:31.089 --> 10:34.843
We are here today to decide
whether to indict him on these charges.

10:34.927 --> 10:37.095
I'd like to testify on my own behalf.

10:37.346 --> 10:38.514
Mr. Burke…

10:38.597 --> 10:41.517
I want to speak to my history as an agent,
and to my character.

10:41.600 --> 10:45.646
Nothing you say will change my decision.
Sit down.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.944
Because,

10:52.027 --> 10:56.657

new evidence has come to light.

but I can't let that happen.

13:30.602 --> 13:32.020
I don't know what you're talking about.

13:32.104 --> 13:35.065
I don't believe for a second
James Bennett made that call.

13:36.859 --> 13:39.236

13:40.112 --> 13:41.822
I don't know how you found your father,

13:41.905 --> 13:44.491
or how you got him
to leave that message, but…

13:45.993 --> 13:47.244
Thank you.

13:48.328 --> 13:52.040

-Thought I saw you earlier.
-Didn't want to interrupt a moment.

14:29.912 --> 14:31.038
That was one nice moment.

14:31.121 --> 14:34.958

have a tendency to stick out in a crowd.

15:08.075 --> 15:10.035
Bruce, I just got out of prison.

15:10.118 --> 15:13.205
You took down a corrupt senator.

15:13.288 --> 15:15.415
That alone is a huge accomplishment.

-And now they want me in DC?
-Not right away.

15:22.005 --> 15:25.592
This is a good office. It's a nice space.

15:25.968 --> 15:28.011

has a much nicer view,

15:28.095 --> 15:30.180

-No, everyone's been great.

16:07.801 --> 16:09.636
I just wanted to stay in the field
as long as possible.

16:10.387 --> 16:13.348
But eventually, no amount of loose blouse
was gonna hide this little guy.

-Yeah, it's a boy.

16:15.934 --> 16:19.563

I don't mean to be indelicate, but…

16:19.646 --> 16:21.023
-It's not Neal's.
-No, I wasn't going…

16:21.356 --> 16:23.275
-I'm kidding.
-Oh, you.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.068
No, I went to a clinic.

with one hell of an IQ.

16:27.905 --> 16:31.658
Good, and his mother
is the best damn agent I ever worked with.

16:31.742 --> 16:32.868
It's a good combo.

16:33.911 --> 16:36.872
So, you gonna take that ASAC job?

16:37.706 --> 16:38.707

16:39.249 --> 16:41.335
-You heard.
-No, I guessed.

16:41.710 --> 16:44.588
That office has been empty for a while
and you would fill it nicely.

16:45.297 --> 16:47.424
I don't know. It's a big change.

16:48.425 --> 16:50.010
You know, I was scared about

16:50.093 --> 16:52.930
whether I'd be able to balance
a career and a baby.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.973
But once I decided, I knew I could do it.

16:55.557 --> 16:57.226
Now, I'm excited to do it.

16:57.601 --> 16:59.561
Change can be good, Peter.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.783
Tinted varnish treatment?

17:13.867 --> 17:15.661
You disapprove.

17:15.869 --> 17:18.121
I prefer watercolors for restoration.

17:18.205 --> 17:20.916
It allows any alterations
to be reversible.

17:22.960 --> 17:26.046
Something to be said for
irreversible decisions, don't you think?

17:26.672 --> 17:28.382
I'm here, aren't I?

17:29.466 --> 17:30.884

17:31.218 --> 17:34.054
There's a vault on the eighth floor
of the Reinhart Building.

17:37.808 --> 17:39.309

17:39.935 --> 17:41.562

about the Welsh.

17:46.024 --> 17:47.359
Get your money a different way.

17:47.484 --> 17:49.903
No. This is what I want.

your rather urgent deadline.

We're gonna go through all of this
for pocket change?

18:20.267 --> 18:23.145
$2 million in gold coins
isn't exactly pocket change.

18:23.228 --> 18:24.938
This building is a fortress, Neal.

18:25.022 --> 18:26.982
Fortresses have fallen
all throughout history.

18:27.065 --> 18:28.942
All it took was
someone finding the weak spot.

18:29.026 --> 18:31.612
Well, with all that security,
we better find a way in that

18:31.695 --> 18:33.989
doesn't involve marching through
the front door.

18:34.072 --> 18:36.491
Maybe we don't go through the front door.

18:38.327 --> 18:39.828
What if we pull a back draft?

18:40.037 --> 18:44.041
I've put my inner firebug to bed.
Best not to awaken him.

18:44.124 --> 18:46.376
Well, there are other ways to
bring the fire department to us.

18:46.460 --> 18:47.586
Well, even if we could,

18:47.669 --> 18:49.630
this is not the kind of building
that clears easily.

18:49.713 --> 18:50.881
But the building next door is.

18:51.340 --> 18:52.883
They share a wall.

18:53.050 --> 18:55.260
So we get the fire department
to clear that,

18:55.344 --> 18:59.264
we break in
and then disappear inside the crowd.

18:59.348 --> 19:00.933
This could work.

19:01.016 --> 19:02.601
You said you cracked the anklet, right?

19:02.976 --> 19:04.228
Yeah.

19:04.895 --> 19:07.564
Okay, this device…

19:09.274 --> 19:11.485
…is synced to your anklet.

19:11.568 --> 19:14.988
I flip the switch, and that's it.

19:15.072 --> 19:17.241
The tracker says you're standing
right where you are.

19:17.950 --> 19:19.201
I am standing where I am.

19:19.451 --> 19:21.119
Yeah, right now you are.

19:21.203 --> 19:25.415
But this captures the signal
and loops it back to the FBI.

19:25.499 --> 19:26.917
So you can walk away.

19:27.125 --> 19:30.087
-And it shows me staying right here?
-Exactly.

19:30.170 --> 19:34.591
The only catch is that you and your anklet
have to come back here to turn it off.

19:34.800 --> 19:38.554
Otherwise, your signal can jump
locations suddenly.

19:38.637 --> 19:40.180

-It's time to load up the equipment.
-I'll take care of them.

26:34.428 --> 26:36.471
Come on, man, you know the rules.
The lieutenant's watching.

26:36.555 --> 26:39.641
Look. I… Thank you.

26:40.726 --> 26:42.561
This is heavy.

26:44.146 --> 26:45.397
Did I miss something?

26:45.480 --> 26:47.691
-Why'd you just give away our gold?
-They would've seen my face.

26:47.774 --> 26:49.818
I'll grab the coins
once the lieutenant's back is turned.

26:54.031 --> 26:55.949
I think his back is now turned.

27:04.333 --> 27:06.960
So out of the frying pan,
into the firehouse.

27:07.044 --> 27:08.837
I didn't have a choice.

27:09.004 --> 27:12.508
Well, the good news is that the tanks
look just like all the other ones.

27:12.591 --> 27:15.135
The one with the gold in it
will be a little heavier.

27:15.219 --> 27:18.514
It'll pass a cursory examination,
but not much else.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.849
Even with this uniform,
if I step foot in there,

27:20.933 --> 27:22.142
they'll know I'm not one of them.

27:22.226 --> 27:25.062
-So the direct approach is out.
-Yep.

27:26.688 --> 27:29.942
Hey, we can wait until
the fire truck takes another call.

27:30.275 --> 27:32.528
If the tanks weren't used,
they'll still be on the truck.

27:32.611 --> 27:34.112
Yeah, I can grab them

27:34.196 --> 27:36.073
while they're dealing
with their emergency.

27:36.156 --> 27:37.407
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

27:37.491 --> 27:39.409
That'll have to be the plan.
Peter's calling me in.

27:39.743 --> 27:41.745
All right,
I'll set up camp outside the station.

27:42.079 --> 27:44.039
As soon as I can get away, I'll meet you.

27:53.340 --> 27:54.675
We've got a case.

27:54.883 --> 27:57.678
We? Aren't you ASAC now?

27:57.803 --> 27:59.638
Paperwork goes through next week.

27:59.721 --> 28:02.099
Today, I'm a field agent
with a bad guy to catch.

28:02.474 --> 28:04.309
-One last case.
-(CHUCKLES)

28:05.227 --> 28:06.603
What is it?

28:06.687 --> 28:08.814
Please don't say mortgage fraud.

28:08.897 --> 28:10.148
Gold coins.

28:10.691 --> 28:13.193
$1.8 million worth of them.

28:13.277 --> 28:14.945
Stolen from a private vault.

28:15.028 --> 28:16.697
Sounds like a good one to end on,
doesn't it?

28:16.780 --> 28:19.616
Yeah. Feels about right.

28:35.883 --> 28:38.844
PETER: Lucky for us,
lots of people recorded today's jumper.

28:38.927 --> 28:42.014
Unluckily, we still haven't been able
to get a clear shot of him.

28:42.097 --> 28:45.434
We're pretty sure, however,
that he was a distraction for this.

28:45.601 --> 28:47.978
Our thieves broke into a travel agency

28:48.061 --> 28:50.355
in order to burrow into
the building next door.

28:50.647 --> 28:53.233
PETER: That way they evaded
the security system of the building

28:53.317 --> 28:55.068
and got away with the gold.

28:56.612 --> 28:58.906
-It's a back draft.
-A back draft?

28:59.323 --> 29:02.326
Set a jumper, call the fire department,
they'll clear out the building

29:02.409 --> 29:04.244
and you can steal whatever you want
while they watch the show.

29:04.578 --> 29:05.913
JONES: Well, whoever he was,

29:05.996 --> 29:08.457
he slipped away before
anyone could properly ID him.

29:08.540 --> 29:09.583
And he was high up enough that

29:09.666 --> 29:11.251
no one in the crowd
could get a clear picture of him.

29:11.335 --> 29:12.920
He's just the distraction.

29:13.587 --> 29:16.256
It's the guy who grabbed the loot
that you need to catch.

29:16.423 --> 29:20.844
I agree,
but we don't have eyes on him yet either.

29:23.597 --> 29:24.848
How would you go in?

29:27.518 --> 29:30.187
I'd go into the travel agency
posing as a vacationer.

29:31.063 --> 29:33.607
Go out with everyone to watch the jumper,
then double back.

29:33.690 --> 29:34.733
Once I grabbed the coins,

29:34.816 --> 29:36.401
I'd change clothes
and blend in with the crowd.

29:36.485 --> 29:39.071
What about the equipment
to get through the vault?

29:39.863 --> 29:42.324
He could dress as a businessman,
carry it in a briefcase.

29:45.077 --> 29:46.537
Pause the video.

29:47.204 --> 29:48.622
What are you thinking?

29:49.248 --> 29:52.125
What if the thief had the equipment
with him the entire time?

29:52.960 --> 29:54.711
Go back about seven seconds.

29:56.922 --> 29:58.048
There.

29:58.966 --> 30:03.011
Why carry a pair of compressed air tanks
if there isn't a fire?

30:05.973 --> 30:09.643
He could fit an acetylene torch in one
and stash the gold in the other.

30:12.062 --> 30:13.272
Comb through the footage.

30:13.355 --> 30:15.899
Let's see if we can put a face
on this guy.

30:15.983 --> 30:18.986
Jones, find out
which fire department responded.

30:19.069 --> 30:20.612
You think this was an inside job?

30:20.696 --> 30:22.781
I'm leaning towards an impersonator,

30:22.865 --> 30:25.409
but either way, the firehouse,
that's our best lead.

Unfortunately, so is Peter.

30:39.173 --> 30:43.510
Well, that's an odd choice of strategy.

30:43.594 --> 30:47.472
He's investigating the coin heist and he's
already traced it to the firehouse.

for the ASAC job.

31:12.080 --> 31:14.958

-One promotion at a time.

-No!

-All right.

How'd it go?

31:38.440 --> 31:39.858
Empty-handedly.

31:40.025 --> 31:42.361

at the station.

of Nazi-occupied France

with a forged visa provided
by this country and brought to New York.

Because I can tell
when I've stepped into a trap.

36:35.487 --> 36:37.072
You lied about having a debt to pay.

36:39.324 --> 36:42.828
I think the gold was used to bribe
the federal prosecutor on Peter's case.

whether Neal was ever there to begin with.

38:33.897 --> 38:35.649
He could go off anklet
without you knowing?

38:35.732 --> 38:36.733

38:37.442 --> 38:40.320
Impossible is what
Neal Caffrey specializes in.

38:40.445 --> 38:44.283
He knew I was facing jail,
and that if I was found guilty,

38:44.366 --> 38:46.660
he'd be heading back as well.

38:46.743 --> 38:52.040
I'd imagine he focused a lot of time
at cracking that anklet.

38:52.124 --> 38:54.710
Yeah, but if he succeeded
and you got out anyways…

38:55.002 --> 38:58.338

a get-away-from-handler free card.

with the coin heist?

why he would do this.

Okay. You're doing it again.

40:01.652 --> 40:02.945
Can't say I do.

40:08.659 --> 40:10.577
My job is all about perspective.

40:11.620 --> 40:15.707
Being able to look at a situation
and evaluate all the angles.

40:15.958 --> 40:18.544
I realize I can't do that anymore.

40:19.962 --> 40:21.296
What are you talking about?

40:22.005 --> 40:24.424
Jones and Diana,

40:25.467 --> 40:29.888
everyone in the White Collar offices,
we're all family and…

40:31.014 --> 40:33.517
You're a part of that family.

40:34.852 --> 40:36.311
You're also a criminal.

40:37.187 --> 40:39.439
I forget that a lot.

40:39.606 --> 40:43.610
And until you've served out your sentence,
that's exactly what you are.

40:43.694 --> 40:47.906
I've made mistakes because
I let emotions cloud my judgment,

40:47.990 --> 40:51.952
and I can't let my next handler
make those same mistakes.

40:52.244 --> 40:54.997
You're choosing someone from
outside the office to be my new handler.

40:56.707 --> 40:59.001
Someone with the right perspective.

40:59.418 --> 41:01.712
Someone who will see you as you are.

41:01.795 --> 41:02.921
A criminal.

41:06.717 --> 41:08.635
This is in your best interest.

41:10.470 --> 41:12.973
Could have sworn the other day
you told me how proud of me you were.

41:13.056 --> 41:14.683
I am. I…

41:15.392 --> 41:16.560
I am.

41:17.394 --> 41:18.687
Neal.

41:19.146 --> 41:21.231
I can't risk you going back.

41:21.940 --> 41:24.026
I don't like this any more than you do.

41:24.943 --> 41:27.654
But it's the way it has to be.

41:29.031 --> 41:30.949
Do I want to know what's in the box?

41:31.200 --> 41:32.784
Got a new anklet in.

41:33.952 --> 41:35.871
Any particular reason?

41:36.997 --> 41:38.874
Felt it was time for an upgrade.

41:39.041 --> 41:41.960
This is an all-new one
with a new chip set.

41:48.634 --> 41:50.511
Looks the same on the outside.

41:51.678 --> 41:53.388
I think
there's a metaphor here somewhere.

41:59.978 --> 42:01.063
(BEEPS)

42:09.821 --> 42:11.949
You know, it's scary.

42:12.449 --> 42:13.534
What's that?

42:13.825 --> 42:15.827
It feels strange when it's not on.

42:19.790 --> 42:22.000
Like I'm missing something.

42:22.084 --> 42:24.044
That's how used to it I've gotten.

42:30.300 --> 42:31.802
See you tomorrow.

42:32.052 --> 42:33.554
Good-bye, Peter.
