06:33.684 --> 06:34.477
{\an1}I JUST THOUGHT OF A WAY

06:34.560 --> 06:36.145
{\an1}TO MAKE IT EVEN COOLER.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.271
{\an1}I'LL PIT THE TWO OF YOU

06:37.355 --> 06:38.356
{\an1}AGAINST EACH OTHER,

06:38.439 --> 06:39.941
{\an1}AND THE LOSER HAS TO SERVE

06:40.024 --> 06:40.358
{\an1}THE WINNER ICE CREAM

06:40.441 --> 06:43.945

06:52.286 --> 06:53.287
{\an1}I REMEMBER THIS ONE TIME

06:53.371 --> 06:53.746
{\an1}I HAD TO SLEEP

06:53.830 --> 06:54.705
{\an1}OVER LULU'S HOUSE,

{\an1}WE HAD A MAPLE STAR FIGHT,

06:55.665 --> 06:56.457
{\an1}THEN WE HAD A PILLOW FIGHT

06:56.541 --> 06:57.291
{\an1}AND IT WAS SO CRAZY

06:57.375 --> 06:59.168
{\an1}BECAUSE I WAS--

{\an1}&gt;&gt; ARE YOU SURE

07:11.305 --> 07:11.764
{\an1}YOU'RE THE VICE PRESIDENT?

07:11.848 --> 07:17.228
{\an1}YOU SEEM A LITTLE YOUNG.

07:17.311 --> 07:18.813
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, AREN'T YOU SWEET?

07:18.896 --> 07:19.939
{\an1}ACTUALLY, I LOOK MORE YOUTHFUL

07:20.857 --> 07:21.440
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, HOW OLD ARE YOU?

07:21.524 --> 07:25.194
{\an1}&gt;&gt; 43 1/2.

07:25.278 --> 07:29.198
