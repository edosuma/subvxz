WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:03.904
Previously on This Is Us...

00:03.937 --> 00:06.640
I don't see her making it
through the night.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.176
RANDALL:
We're good now.

00:08.209 --> 00:10.711
You made us good.

00:10.744 --> 00:13.013
You tell him hey.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.551
Hey.

00:18.586 --> 00:19.653
Hey.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.589
I'm pregnant.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.257
You're gonna be a grandfather.

00:23.291 --> 00:26.760
I'm not worried about
forgetting about the big stuff.

00:26.794 --> 00:29.263
It's the regular...

00:29.297 --> 00:31.399
Saturday
when the kids were little,

00:31.432 --> 00:34.001
a day when nothing big
really happened.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.736
We were just laughing

00:35.769 --> 00:38.038
and playing
pin the tail on the donkey.

00:38.072 --> 00:40.641
That's the stuff
I'm not ready to let go of yet.

00:41.809 --> 00:44.145
(birds chirping)

00:57.458 --> 01:00.328
-Mm. Hey.
-Hey.

01:01.629 --> 01:03.063
Mm.

01:04.165 --> 01:06.167
(takes deep breath)

01:07.635 --> 01:11.439
Did you know you have
a tiny little scar

01:11.472 --> 01:14.007
-underneath your eyebrow?
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

01:15.008 --> 01:16.977
Yeah.

01:17.010 --> 01:19.947
I never noticed it before.

01:19.980 --> 01:21.782
Yeah. (inhales deeply)

01:21.815 --> 01:25.052
It comes out
when I'm in the sun,

01:25.085 --> 01:27.121
and I got a little sun
the other day.

01:27.155 --> 01:30.591
I can't believe
I never noticed it.

01:32.993 --> 01:35.629
(clears throat) So...

01:35.663 --> 01:37.631
-when I was a little girl...
-Mm-hmm.

01:37.665 --> 01:39.633
...there was this little
playground right by my house

01:39.667 --> 01:42.303
that my dad would take me to
sometimes,

01:42.336 --> 01:46.140
and it had one of
those really lame slides

01:46.174 --> 01:48.942
-that would give you burn marks
on your butt. Mm-hmm.
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:48.976 --> 01:50.944
And, um, you know,

01:50.978 --> 01:53.113
one of those weird
old rocking horse things

01:53.147 --> 01:54.615
that only had one eye.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.517
The springy ones.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.486
-Yeah, yeah.
-Totally creeped me out.

01:58.519 --> 02:03.291
But then
there was this one swing.

02:03.324 --> 02:05.159
God, I loved that swing.

02:06.860 --> 02:09.663
And he would push me on it.

02:09.697 --> 02:13.100
And one time,
I remember I turned around

02:13.133 --> 02:16.204
on the way back down, and
my dad wasn't paying attention,

02:16.237 --> 02:19.973
and his watch clocked me
right above the eye.

02:20.007 --> 02:21.475
Hmm.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.611
He felt so bad,

02:23.644 --> 02:27.181
but I didn't care because
him pushing me in that swing

02:27.215 --> 02:28.716
was just my favorite thing

02:28.749 --> 02:30.050
in the entire world, you know?

02:30.083 --> 02:33.287
DAVE:
And we swing.

02:33.321 --> 02:37.157
It was such a treat for me,
going there with him.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.494
But I would just-- I'd spend

02:40.528 --> 02:44.565
the entire time
worrying about when...

02:46.367 --> 02:49.637
...he would stop pushing me,

02:49.670 --> 02:52.273
when he'd say
that it was time to go home.

02:56.009 --> 02:58.812
Really wish that I had spent
more time appreciating it

02:58.846 --> 03:01.482
when it was all happening,

03:01.515 --> 03:04.585
instead of just...

03:04.618 --> 03:07.321
worrying about
when it would end.

03:07.355 --> 03:09.323
Hmm.

03:09.357 --> 03:11.892
At least I still have the scar.

03:14.462 --> 03:16.930
(sighs) Oh.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.732
-Hmm.
-Um...

03:18.766 --> 03:20.167
Randall's math thing
got canceled today,

03:20.200 --> 03:23.537
so we have a completely free
Saturday with no plans.

03:24.572 --> 03:27.107
No football games,
no playdates.

03:27.140 --> 03:29.042
What should we do?

03:30.143 --> 03:31.445
Nothing.

03:31.479 --> 03:32.946
-Nothing.
-Mm-hmm.

03:32.980 --> 03:37.084
Oh, nothing sounds so nice.

03:37.117 --> 03:38.786
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

03:41.154 --> 03:43.824
And swing, Rebecca.

03:46.594 --> 03:49.463
And we swing.

03:49.497 --> 03:52.433
-Ready, Randall? (whoops)
-Kate, touch the sky.

03:52.466 --> 03:54.067
-And we swing!
-Touch the sky with your feet.

03:54.101 --> 03:55.102
There you go.

03:55.135 --> 03:57.471
*

03:58.306 --> 04:01.642
-And we swing!
-(chuckles)

04:01.675 --> 04:03.877
-Higher!
-And we swing!

04:03.911 --> 04:04.878
(Beth whoops)

04:04.912 --> 04:06.614
(Kevin laughs)

04:06.647 --> 04:08.882
Swing. Throw your arms up.
(whooshes)

04:08.916 --> 04:11.652
*

04:13.654 --> 04:15.323
-Whee!
-(Toby speaks indistinctly)

04:15.356 --> 04:17.891
-(Kate laughs)
-(gasps)

04:17.925 --> 04:18.959
All right, Hope. Ready?

04:18.992 --> 04:20.394
BOTH:
Back and forth,

04:20.428 --> 04:23.230
and we swing!

04:23.263 --> 04:25.733
-And swing!
-Swing. (chuckles)

04:25.766 --> 04:27.801
*

04:37.678 --> 04:39.480
(birds chirping)

04:43.651 --> 04:45.519
(clicks tongue)

04:45.553 --> 04:47.187
(sighs)

04:49.823 --> 04:51.859
*

05:01.802 --> 05:03.837
*

05:14.815 --> 05:16.484
(sighs)

05:29.930 --> 05:31.599
(chuckles softly)

05:43.777 --> 05:45.846
*

05:52.219 --> 05:53.186
JACK:
Hey, guys!

05:53.220 --> 05:54.455
Breakfast!

05:58.792 --> 06:00.861
-(lively chatter)
-Attention. Hello.

06:00.894 --> 06:02.095
-JACK: Mmm. Okay, Mom's up.
-So...

06:02.129 --> 06:04.264
since Randall's math contest
got canceled...

06:04.297 --> 06:06.366
-Mathletes.
-What?

06:06.400 --> 06:09.102
It's Mathletes,
and it's not a contest.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.438
It's a group of math enthusiasts

06:10.471 --> 06:12.973
who perform and compete
at a, um...

06:14.975 --> 06:16.410
Forget it.
I'll talk about it later.

06:16.444 --> 06:18.746
-Go ahead.
-It just means we have

06:18.779 --> 06:20.247
a completely free Saturday.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.449
Just us.

06:21.482 --> 06:22.950
(groans)

06:22.983 --> 06:24.785
JACK: Oh, what? Come on.
Is it really that hard

06:24.818 --> 06:27.187
-to be all together for a day?
-RANDALL AND KATE: Mm-hmm.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.356
-Yes.
-(Kate snickers)

06:29.389 --> 06:32.460
REBECCA: Okay, well,
what do you guys want to do?

06:32.493 --> 06:35.362
-Whatever.
-KEVIN: Don't care.
-(scoffs) O-Okay.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.130
Katie girl, what do you got?

06:37.164 --> 06:38.732
Anything we want?

06:38.766 --> 06:40.100
-Mm-hmm.
-All day?

06:40.133 --> 06:42.603
Anything you want. All day.

06:42.636 --> 06:43.837
What do you got, Katie girl?

06:45.138 --> 06:46.440
-Several ideas.
-REBECCA: Oh, well, there we go.

06:46.474 --> 06:47.775
Several ideas.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.309
-Okay. I like that.
-JACK: She's got ideas.

06:49.342 --> 06:51.311
I like, I like people
with several ideas.

06:51.344 --> 06:53.614
(overlapping chatter)

06:53.647 --> 06:55.516
(Randall sighs)

06:56.817 --> 06:59.119
How's the writing coming?

06:59.152 --> 07:00.320
Slowly.

07:02.956 --> 07:06.660
-Thanks.
-Service is in, uh,
less than two hours.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.162
I'm aware.

07:13.467 --> 07:15.435
(sighs heavily)

07:20.273 --> 07:21.241
What?

07:21.274 --> 07:23.010
Nothing.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.845
I'm just checking on you.

07:24.878 --> 07:26.547
I'm good.

07:27.615 --> 07:29.650
(scribbling on paper)

07:31.852 --> 07:33.320
(pen clatters)

07:33.353 --> 07:34.555
What, woman?

07:35.556 --> 07:38.358
I think we need to bang out
a worst-case scenario.

07:38.391 --> 07:40.494
-About what?
-You.

07:42.195 --> 07:43.864
You go first.

07:43.897 --> 07:46.299
I don't even know what
we're worst-case scenario-ing.

07:46.333 --> 07:49.637
After burying your fourth
and final parent, you lose it.

07:49.670 --> 07:52.472
No parents left to bury,
you spend the rest of your days

07:52.506 --> 07:54.107
going to other people's
parents' funerals.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.176
Just crying single tears

07:56.209 --> 07:58.646
at funerals of parents
you don't even know.

07:58.679 --> 07:59.847
Go.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.315
I really don't think
I'm gonna be going to...

08:02.349 --> 08:04.785
You buy an RV. (clicks tongue)

08:04.818 --> 08:06.720
Wake up one morning and say,
"Beth, we need an RV."

08:06.754 --> 08:08.956
I say, "Sure, I can get down
with an RV."

08:08.989 --> 08:11.358
You spend the rest of your days
traveling back and forth

08:11.391 --> 08:13.193
between your parents'
various resting places,

08:13.226 --> 08:15.596
just driving from tree to tree.

08:16.564 --> 08:18.632
-Baby, I'm...
-Mind you,

08:18.666 --> 08:20.400
I didn't even mention Miguel.

08:20.433 --> 08:23.036
I just realized that.
Maybe you realize it, too.

08:23.070 --> 08:25.739
-You decide you need
to go to Puerto Rico.
-(scoffs)

08:25.773 --> 08:28.709
Try and learn about his deceased
great-grandmother's story,

08:28.742 --> 08:29.910
come back talking about
swimming in the Atlantic Ocean

08:29.943 --> 08:31.311
with Miguel's
great-grandmama's ghost.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.680
-And I'm thinking to myself...
-Uh, Beth. I'm okay.

08:34.281 --> 08:36.483
I am appropriately sad,

08:36.516 --> 08:40.187
and I am appropriately anxious
about this eulogy.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.189
All right?

08:42.222 --> 08:43.991
I'm centered,

08:44.024 --> 08:47.394
and I'm looking forward
to this quiet next chapter

08:47.427 --> 08:51.098
with my wife and our lives,

08:51.131 --> 08:53.634
and our eventual grandchildren.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.971
Have you made a decision
about deep-fried Oreos?

08:58.939 --> 09:01.609
(takes deep breath)

09:01.642 --> 09:03.944
Musing.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.212
You?

09:06.213 --> 09:07.815
Same.

09:08.816 --> 09:11.284
REBECCA:
Hey, Bug, these lines looking
straight enough to you?

09:11.318 --> 09:14.287
-Yep. Perfect.
-Great.

09:14.321 --> 09:18.191
I don't want to play four square
with my parents. It's lame.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.060
Yeah, well,
you should have contributed

09:20.093 --> 09:21.394
to the suggestions, then, Kev.

09:21.428 --> 09:23.430
Kevin's right, this is stupid.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.266
What is it with you two today?

09:27.167 --> 09:28.869
Hey, ladies.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.138
Coming to check
on your chalk work.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.841
*

09:45.185 --> 09:46.820
REBECCA:
Whoa. Oh. Right?

09:46.854 --> 09:48.922
That was an assist.
That was an assist.

09:48.956 --> 09:50.123
-(Rebecca whoops)
-(Jack laughs)

09:50.157 --> 09:52.225
-(Rebecca chuckles)
-Four big ones.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.461
*

09:54.494 --> 09:56.463
(footsteps approaching)

09:56.496 --> 09:58.298
(chuckles softly)

10:05.505 --> 10:08.308
If it's okay with you,
I would like to say three things

10:08.341 --> 10:11.344
that will surely cross
multiple ex-husband lines

10:11.378 --> 10:13.046
and protocols.

10:14.848 --> 10:16.950
-Proceed.
-Okay.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.218
Number one.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.691
She was extraordinarily
proud of you.

10:25.893 --> 10:28.796
I am extraordinarily
proud of you.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.030
That was number two.

10:30.063 --> 10:32.165
They get progressively
more and more intense

10:32.199 --> 10:34.034
-as we go.
-Gotcha.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.136
And the third one is
a real doozy.

10:37.537 --> 10:38.872
Today is a doozy.

10:38.906 --> 10:41.441
So...

10:41.474 --> 10:44.011
I love you, kid.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.816
I love you.

10:49.817 --> 10:51.518
And even though our marriage
didn't go the distance,

10:51.551 --> 10:53.687
if Doc Brown showed up right now

10:53.721 --> 10:55.522
and offered me a ride
in the DeLorean,

10:55.555 --> 10:57.891
I would go right back to
that weight loss support group

10:57.925 --> 11:00.193
and make stupid faces at you.

11:00.227 --> 11:02.029
(chuckles)

11:02.062 --> 11:03.463
(distant chatter and laughter)

11:03.496 --> 11:04.965
That's
a Back to the Future reference.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.767
I know, I was married to you.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.269
Yes, you were.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.175
Yes, I was.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.690
(door opens)

11:32.092 --> 11:35.095
Kate? Kate.

11:35.128 --> 11:38.799
Thought you wanted to watch
the home movies next, right?

11:43.804 --> 11:45.605
It's raining pretty hard, huh?

11:49.977 --> 11:52.479
Hey, how about we play a game
next weekend?

11:54.447 --> 11:57.250
Better yet, how about you play
and I'll watch?

11:57.284 --> 11:59.787
I really just like
being together.

11:59.820 --> 12:03.456
Plus, only four people can play,

12:03.490 --> 12:05.793
and I just slow the game down.

12:05.826 --> 12:08.461
That's okay.

12:08.495 --> 12:13.333
I mean, all I want nowadays is
to slow things down anyway.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.936
Me, too.

12:18.438 --> 12:20.140
Home movies?

12:20.173 --> 12:22.309
-Home movies.
-Okay.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.648
(sighs)

12:31.318 --> 12:34.454
-KIDS: We love cake!
-REBECCA: One, two, three.

12:34.487 --> 12:35.923
Oh, wait. Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

12:35.956 --> 12:38.792
This-this is it.
This. Is. The. One.

12:38.826 --> 12:40.627
(VCR whirs)

12:42.762 --> 12:44.497
(Rebecca gasps)

12:44.531 --> 12:46.299
(chuckles)

12:46.333 --> 12:47.901
-REBECCA: No way.
-JACK: Uh-huh.

12:47.935 --> 12:49.169
(dishes clatter on video)

12:49.202 --> 12:50.503
Come on, not on camera, please.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.639
I'm a mess.
I'm covered in sauce.

12:52.672 --> 12:54.641
-Yeah. Oh, yeah. You know what?
You're revolting, okay?
-(chuckles)

12:54.674 --> 12:55.843
I... I want to show you
something

12:55.876 --> 12:57.110
that I've been working on.

12:57.144 --> 12:58.611
Can I just finish the dishes
first, please?

12:58.645 --> 13:00.080
Nope. Get ready.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.681
-Hey, Big Three.
-(Rebecca chuckles)

13:01.714 --> 13:03.316
Enter.

13:03.350 --> 13:04.784
Come on, come on. Come on in,
come on in.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.119
Come on in. Come on in.

13:06.153 --> 13:07.287
(Jack laughs)

13:07.320 --> 13:08.788
Come on in. Come on in, Kev.

13:08.822 --> 13:11.291
-Ready?
-BIG THREE: Ready!

13:11.324 --> 13:12.292
REBECCA:
Look at you guys.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.294
How are you that little?

13:14.327 --> 13:15.863
-JACK: So tiny.
-Look how cute you were, Kev.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.865
JACK (on video):
Ready. First came...

13:17.898 --> 13:19.366
Me.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.468
-JACK: And Dad said...
-"Gee."

13:21.501 --> 13:22.936
-JACK: And then came...
-Me.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.537
-JACK: And Mom said...
-"We."

13:24.571 --> 13:26.106
-JACK: And then came...
-Me.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.141
-JACK: And we said...
-"That's three."

13:28.175 --> 13:29.376
JACK:
Big Three.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.478
ALL:
Big Three!

13:31.511 --> 13:32.980
Ah!

13:33.013 --> 13:34.614
Jack, are you kidding me?

13:34.647 --> 13:36.349
How long did that take?

13:36.383 --> 13:37.617
JACK:
Oh, that was, uh...

13:37.650 --> 13:40.053
that was l-less than
potty training

13:40.087 --> 13:41.621
-but longer than the ABCs.
-(gasps)

13:41.654 --> 13:43.823
You guys are so good!

13:43.857 --> 13:45.125
-Come give me hugs.
-REBECCA: Little Kev.
-JACK: Yeah.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.294
-REBECCA: Kev, look.
-Kevin, look.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.129
REBECCA (on video):
Oh, my goodness.
You're so smart.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.530
I've seen this
like a million times.

13:50.563 --> 13:52.465
-Yeah.
-(Rebecca scoffs)

13:52.499 --> 13:53.833
I'm gonna go upstairs.

13:55.202 --> 13:56.736
Today sucks.

13:57.770 --> 14:00.140
(chatter on video continues)

14:00.173 --> 14:02.509
Two rays of sunshine.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.512
Knock, knock.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.748
-KEVIN: Go away.
-(scoffs)

14:09.849 --> 14:12.552
Uh-uh. Enough, Kev. Okay?

14:13.853 --> 14:16.523
Hey. What's going on, bud?

14:22.795 --> 14:25.565
Yesterday we did
the President Fitness thing.

14:25.598 --> 14:27.767
Uh-huh.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.870
I got the best time in the mile,
and I did the most sit-ups.

14:30.904 --> 14:33.540
I did just whatever
on the sit and reach, but...

14:33.573 --> 14:35.608
that's for girls anyway,
so who cares.

14:36.743 --> 14:38.912
So, what's the problem?

14:38.946 --> 14:41.614
I couldn't do any pull-ups.

14:41.648 --> 14:44.317
I've just never been
able to do them.

14:46.319 --> 14:50.190
So you can't do a pull-up.
What's the big deal?

14:50.223 --> 14:53.961
I was just hanging there
for, like, two minutes,

14:53.994 --> 14:56.029
and everyone was laughing.

14:56.063 --> 14:58.531
At me. They were laughing at me,
Mom.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.467
Okay. (clears throat)

15:00.500 --> 15:02.302
First of all,

15:02.335 --> 15:05.072
I'm sure no one was
laughing at you.

15:06.306 --> 15:09.576
Yeah. Maybe not.

15:09.609 --> 15:11.911
Plus, I had Sophie tell
a bunch of the girls

15:11.945 --> 15:14.948
that I was faking it,
so all the unathletic kids

15:14.982 --> 15:16.783
didn't feel bad
when they couldn't do one.

15:17.985 --> 15:20.120
It played.

15:20.153 --> 15:22.755
Ugh. Kevin.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.193
I really just couldn't do one,
Mom.

15:27.194 --> 15:29.729
Yeah.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.465
But that's okay.

15:32.499 --> 15:35.768
You know, not everything is
gonna come easy to you.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.638
*

15:38.671 --> 15:40.340
I think you're gonna have to

15:40.373 --> 15:43.643
work pretty hard
to become the person

15:43.676 --> 15:45.478
I know you can become.

15:46.646 --> 15:49.649
And it will make
the big victories in life

15:49.682 --> 15:51.118
that much more special

15:51.151 --> 15:53.486
when you have to work
a little harder for them.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.632
Do you know
what Dr. Jaffey told us

16:05.665 --> 16:08.368
-when we went
for your last checkup?
-Hmm?

16:08.401 --> 16:11.638
He told us he thinks that
you're gonna be really tall,

16:11.671 --> 16:14.941
like over six feet tall.

16:14.974 --> 16:18.178
-Really?
-Mm-hmm. "A real jock,"
is what he said.

16:18.211 --> 16:20.313
Oh, God. That'd be so great.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.615
Yeah.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.284
(Rebecca scoffs)

16:24.317 --> 16:26.153
(sighs) I feel better.

16:26.186 --> 16:29.022
Well, I'm glad.

16:29.056 --> 16:30.857
I think.

16:30.890 --> 16:33.826
(chuckles):
Actually, I... I have no idea.

16:33.860 --> 16:35.995
No, really, Mom.

16:36.029 --> 16:38.498
-You always know what to say.
-I do?

16:38.531 --> 16:41.334
You're really good
at this kind of stuff.

16:42.869 --> 16:44.404
Thank you, Kev.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.140
-You get one kiss.
-(gasps)

16:47.174 --> 16:48.641
-KEVIN: Just one.
-REBECCA: I just get one kiss?

16:48.675 --> 16:49.976
-Yes.
-Okay.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.244
Well, then obviously I'm gonna
have to get more.

16:51.278 --> 16:54.681
-Hey, stop it! Mom.
-(laughing)

16:59.852 --> 17:01.488
(sighs)

17:01.521 --> 17:03.456
Can't believe I'm standing here.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.060
My brother's wife's funeral.

17:08.795 --> 17:11.431
You know...

17:11.464 --> 17:13.666
before you came
banging on the door

17:13.700 --> 17:16.769
of that trailer of mine,

17:16.803 --> 17:20.240
I had it pretty good, you know?

17:20.273 --> 17:21.808
I didn't care about anything.

17:23.443 --> 17:25.278
You know, the good thing...

17:25.312 --> 17:29.082
about not caring about anything

17:29.116 --> 17:33.553
is that you don't care
when it's gone. Yeah.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.889
You really effed up my life,
kid.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.760
And your mother and father
would be ashamed if they knew

17:40.793 --> 17:45.932
what you did to a sweet
and sensitive old man like me.

17:47.634 --> 17:50.170
-You dick.
-(scoffs)

17:52.139 --> 17:53.573
Okay.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.753
You want to tell me
what's going on with you?

18:08.455 --> 18:10.457
Not really.

18:10.490 --> 18:13.793
-But you're gonna make me,
so I might as well, right?
-Mm-hmm.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.729
Mathletes didn't get canceled.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.731
I lied to you guys.

18:18.765 --> 18:19.832
Why?

18:21.834 --> 18:23.436
(sighs)

18:24.871 --> 18:27.440
-There was this kid
in math class...
-Mm-hmm.

18:27.474 --> 18:30.243
He's been going kind of hard
at me for the last week or so.

18:30.277 --> 18:31.844
Okay.

18:31.878 --> 18:35.615
Anyways,
he's been calling me Fuzz.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.184
Fuzz?

18:37.217 --> 18:39.586
My-my lip.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.588
There's hair.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.856
-Don't you see that?
-Oh, yeah.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.925
Yeah. Gotcha.

18:45.958 --> 18:49.462
He was just going hard
at me yesterday,

18:49.496 --> 18:52.299
just as Rory Seltzer was sitting
in the desk in front of me,

18:52.332 --> 18:55.067
and I just wanted to get all the
attention off of me, you know?

18:57.136 --> 18:59.839
So I-I pulled Rory Seltzer's
chair out from underneath him

18:59.872 --> 19:02.275
as he sat, and he went down.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.676
Like, hard.

19:03.710 --> 19:06.479
Mrs. Dunne saw and...

19:06.513 --> 19:08.147
she suspended me from Mathletes
for a week,

19:08.181 --> 19:09.582
and I got detention.

19:12.185 --> 19:15.655
There's a note, by the way.
You guys need to sign it.

19:15.688 --> 19:19.292
You-you don't need to say
anything; I feel awful.

19:19.326 --> 19:21.394
I'm never gonna forgive myself.

19:22.529 --> 19:25.064
And Rory Seltzer is gonna have
a terrible life

19:25.097 --> 19:26.399
because of what I did.

19:26.433 --> 19:28.401
I'm sure
Rory Seltzer's gonna have

19:28.435 --> 19:30.803
a pretty terrible life anyway.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.872
Don't be funny.
Please don't be funny.

19:33.906 --> 19:35.808
Look, Randall, I...

19:35.842 --> 19:37.310
I don't know
how to discipline someone

19:37.344 --> 19:39.912
who's already harder on himself
than I could ever be.

19:39.946 --> 19:42.682
Okay? It's kind of confusing.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.218
Sorry.

19:45.252 --> 19:50.122
But I do know a thing or two
about facial hair.

19:51.258 --> 19:53.393
You want me to teach you
how to shave?

19:57.129 --> 19:59.432
-Yeah. Yeah, sure.
-Yeah? Okay.

19:59.466 --> 20:01.534
(pages rustling)

20:09.609 --> 20:11.644
*

20:16.316 --> 20:18.318
(dialogue inaudible)

20:24.891 --> 20:26.959
(muffled singing)

20:28.961 --> 20:30.997
*

20:40.106 --> 20:42.141
(dialogue inaudible)

20:51.083 --> 20:53.786
*

21:07.934 --> 21:09.802
JACK:
All right, here we go.

21:09.836 --> 21:11.838
-Got it? You ready?
-Mm-hmm.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.640
Okay.

21:14.974 --> 21:17.410
-I'm afraid
I'm gonna cut myself.
-You won't.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.111
-Okay.
-Go like this.

21:19.145 --> 21:20.947
Hey, what are you guys doing?

21:21.881 --> 21:24.851
-Dad's teaching me to shave.
-I want to shave.

21:24.884 --> 21:27.620
-Dude, you don't even have
any facial hair.
-Yes, I do.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.622
Okay. Hey-- Hold on.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

21:29.656 --> 21:33.125
Kev, put some warm water
on your face first. Go ahead.

21:33.159 --> 21:36.295
Get some warm water on your face
and then the shaving cream.

21:36.329 --> 21:38.331
Okay? Just a little bit.
Spread it around.

21:38.365 --> 21:39.799
No, go ahead. Spread it around.

21:39.832 --> 21:42.001
Here. Yeah, spread it around.

21:42.034 --> 21:44.504
There you go.
Here. Go like this.

21:44.537 --> 21:46.473
Mm-hmm.

21:46.506 --> 21:48.307
-Mm.
-(chuckles)

21:48.341 --> 21:50.377
There you go. See?
Just like your brother.

21:50.410 --> 21:52.812
-Mm-hmm.
-All right.

21:52.845 --> 21:54.347
And then dry your hand off,
okay?

21:54.381 --> 21:57.316
Randall, you're up. Here you go.

21:59.185 --> 22:00.820
Yeah, go ahead.

22:00.853 --> 22:02.021
Okay.

22:06.092 --> 22:07.059
There you go.

22:07.093 --> 22:09.462
Holy crap, dude!
You're shaving.

22:09.496 --> 22:11.063
Oh, my gosh, I know, I know.

22:11.097 --> 22:12.965
Hey, guys, your sister wants...

22:12.999 --> 22:15.468
Oh, my God.

22:15.502 --> 22:17.470
What am I seeing right now?

22:17.504 --> 22:19.305
It was time, babe.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.140
Oh, come on.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.376
-Those cute little faces.
-Mom.

22:23.410 --> 22:24.477
-Mom, please.
-All right, okay,
I'm going, I'm going.

22:24.511 --> 22:26.045
Hey, Kev, Kev, you're up.

22:26.078 --> 22:27.313
Ooh.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.548
Just nice and easy pressure.

22:28.581 --> 22:29.682
Look in the mirror.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.386
There you go. Put
a little more pressure on it.

22:33.420 --> 22:35.221
Doing good. Here.

22:35.254 --> 22:36.689
Do one of these on your chin.

22:36.723 --> 22:38.190
Go sideways to your chin.

22:38.224 --> 22:40.893
KATE:
Guys, come on,
pin the tail on the donkey!

22:40.927 --> 22:43.563
Why does she want
to do all this?

22:43.596 --> 22:46.065
I don't know,
it's all baby stuff anyways.

22:46.098 --> 22:48.067
I know, right, I mean...
(chuckles)

22:48.100 --> 22:50.069
-we're shaving.
-(chuckles)

22:50.102 --> 22:53.372
Hey, don't underestimate
your sister, gentlemen.

22:53.406 --> 22:55.207
She gets it.

22:55.241 --> 22:57.877
At a very young age,
she gets it.

22:57.910 --> 22:59.912
What?

22:59.946 --> 23:01.781
Well, when you're young,

23:01.814 --> 23:04.116
you're always trying
to be older.

23:04.150 --> 23:05.852
Then, when you get old,

23:05.885 --> 23:08.387
you're always trying
to go back, be back.

23:08.421 --> 23:10.457
Try and appreciate the moments,
you know?

23:10.490 --> 23:12.459
-Here, Kev, get a little
on the side.
-KEVIN: Hmm?

23:12.492 --> 23:14.861
-Here? Here?
-Yeah.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.229
I mean, that's
what we're doing, just...

23:17.263 --> 23:20.467
collecting these little moments.

23:21.501 --> 23:23.870
We don't recognize them
when we're in 'em because...

23:23.903 --> 23:26.739
well, we're too busy
looking forward.

23:28.140 --> 23:30.643
But then we spend
the rest of our lives

23:30.677 --> 23:32.745
looking back.

23:34.481 --> 23:36.516
Trying to,
trying to remember them.

23:38.350 --> 23:40.653
Trying to be back inside 'em.

23:44.190 --> 23:46.959
Hmm, it's strange,
the things you remember.

23:46.993 --> 23:49.295
KEVIN:
You're being really weird, Dad.

23:49.328 --> 23:52.298
Mm-hmm, really weird.

23:52.331 --> 23:54.333
One day you'll get it.

23:56.335 --> 23:58.304
All right, looking good.

23:58.337 --> 24:00.473
Hold on, hold on,
let me have a look at you.

24:03.676 --> 24:06.946
-Yep, still my sons.
-(both laugh)

24:21.060 --> 24:24.330
Just checking in on you.

24:26.298 --> 24:27.266
(sniffles)

24:27.299 --> 24:28.835
Barely slept.

24:28.868 --> 24:31.270
I was up all night
writing a eulogy,

24:31.303 --> 24:33.673
and I can't remember
a single thing that I said.

24:39.478 --> 24:42.682
A depressing notion
for a depressing day-- may I?

24:47.186 --> 24:49.622
It all just feels so...

24:49.656 --> 24:51.524
pointless.

24:52.859 --> 24:56.529
I spent my entire childhood
worrying about losing her.

24:56.563 --> 24:59.131
I spent the past decade

24:59.165 --> 25:01.601
abjectly terrified of it.

25:03.435 --> 25:05.504
And now she's gone.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.908
And yet...

25:08.941 --> 25:11.544
the birds chirp on.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.381
I notice that I'm hungry.

25:16.849 --> 25:19.485
Five minutes ago,
I thought about work.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.854
Tomorrow I'll shower.

25:23.856 --> 25:26.693
It just all feels so pointless.

25:31.297 --> 25:33.399
That too depressing?

25:33.432 --> 25:36.102
Definitely less funny
than your eulogy.

25:36.135 --> 25:37.704
(laughs)

25:41.974 --> 25:43.209
(sniffles)

25:43.242 --> 25:45.812
We'll... give you two a minute.

25:55.254 --> 25:57.289
(sighs)

26:01.928 --> 26:04.597
It's not pointless, Dad.

26:08.901 --> 26:10.236
Hey.

26:10.269 --> 26:11.638
Gonna be a grandfather.

26:11.671 --> 26:13.740
Remember?

26:16.008 --> 26:18.077
A grandfather.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.124
Hey.

26:32.158 --> 26:34.293
We're getting an early start.

26:34.326 --> 26:36.095
Okay.

26:36.128 --> 26:39.031
You keep up with your chess
while I'm gone, do you hear?

26:40.366 --> 26:42.902
-Okay.
-Okay, then.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.805
Go back to sleep.

27:02.722 --> 27:04.691
(exhales)

27:04.724 --> 27:06.759
Grandfather.

27:06.793 --> 27:08.761
Strange word.

27:08.795 --> 27:10.529
Grand. Father.

27:10.562 --> 27:12.131
(exhales)

27:12.164 --> 27:14.200
Never thought of myself
as either, really.

27:14.233 --> 27:16.468
-Well, look at you now.
-Well...

27:16.502 --> 27:18.037
look at me now.

27:20.639 --> 27:23.475
Such a strange relationship:
grandparent.

27:23.509 --> 27:26.813
Not as complicated as parent,
not as fraught.

27:26.846 --> 27:29.115
But it's just...

27:29.148 --> 27:31.150
unconditional.

27:31.183 --> 27:33.886
Easy, pure love.

27:33.920 --> 27:36.956
What an unusual thing.

27:36.989 --> 27:39.458
To love someone
so unconditionally

27:39.491 --> 27:42.128
when you know time
probably won't allow you

27:42.161 --> 27:44.230
to be a big part of their story.

27:49.435 --> 27:51.503
I don't remember
my grandparents.

27:53.205 --> 27:56.175
I can only access
fleeting images.

27:56.208 --> 27:58.878
Smells.

27:58.911 --> 28:01.680
The smell of pies.

28:01.714 --> 28:04.416
She made pies, I think,
my mother's mother.

28:06.618 --> 28:08.420
My father's father
smoked a pipe.

28:08.454 --> 28:11.090
I remember
the smell of that pipe.

28:13.860 --> 28:17.263
Oh, I look
at those two little girls.

28:18.798 --> 28:21.267
I've known them
all of seven months,

28:21.300 --> 28:24.170
and only now
can I even comprehend

28:24.203 --> 28:27.974
how intensely my grandparents
must have loved me.

28:29.475 --> 28:32.611
And all I can remember
are fleeting images.

28:32.644 --> 28:35.581
Smells of pies and pipes.

28:39.218 --> 28:42.121
I wonder what
they'll remember about me.

28:43.155 --> 28:44.390
A lot.

28:44.423 --> 28:46.859
Yeah, a selfish thing
to worry about,

28:46.893 --> 28:49.495
-I know...
-A lot.

28:53.065 --> 28:56.468
Plus you got that really nice,
really distinctive smell.

28:56.502 --> 28:58.370
Well, thank God for that.

28:58.404 --> 29:00.973
Like shaving cream
and old sweaters.

29:01.007 --> 29:02.975
(both laugh)

29:05.511 --> 29:07.613
Okay.

29:07.646 --> 29:09.748
(sighs)

29:09.782 --> 29:11.150
Memphis?

29:11.183 --> 29:12.518
-Memphis.
-All right.

29:13.519 --> 29:16.022
Let's hit the road, Grandpa.

29:20.459 --> 29:22.228
I've been checking
my phone all day.

29:22.261 --> 29:23.896
Hoping I'd receive an email,

29:23.930 --> 29:26.098
so I could tell you something
that would...

29:26.132 --> 29:28.167
maybe make you smile.

29:29.335 --> 29:31.904
Just got the email.

29:31.938 --> 29:34.440
Found out the sex of the baby.

29:38.310 --> 29:40.346
It's a boy.

29:42.481 --> 29:44.516
You're gonna have a grandson.

29:46.819 --> 29:48.320
A boy?

29:48.354 --> 29:49.755
You're sure?

29:49.788 --> 29:51.657
Mm-hmm.

29:51.690 --> 29:53.860
And, um...

29:53.893 --> 29:56.028
if it's okay with you...

29:57.830 --> 30:00.732
...we'd like
to name him William.

30:04.971 --> 30:06.805
Your grandson

30:06.839 --> 30:09.608
is gonna be named
after a man I never met.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.677
But I know him.

30:13.846 --> 30:16.715
'Cause I know you.

30:17.716 --> 30:19.818
It's not pointless.

30:25.858 --> 30:27.894
(sniffles)

30:30.696 --> 30:32.798
A boy?

30:32.831 --> 30:35.234
-Boy.
-Aah! Finally!

30:35.267 --> 30:37.336
(both laugh)

30:39.038 --> 30:41.740
About damn time, man.

30:41.773 --> 30:43.242
We're having a boy!
(laughs)

30:43.275 --> 30:45.344
I'm having a boy, but...

30:45.377 --> 30:47.179
It ain't nothing but women.

30:47.213 --> 30:48.680
All my life,

30:48.714 --> 30:51.984
I got Black women here,
Black women there.

30:52.018 --> 30:53.986
Dej, I love you and you sisters

30:54.020 --> 30:56.722
and your mama,
all the women in my life,

30:56.755 --> 30:59.892
but a little boy...
(laughs)

30:59.926 --> 31:03.029
Little baby boy,
do a little dance.

31:08.734 --> 31:10.937
Aw.

31:12.104 --> 31:14.206
What are you doing?

31:14.240 --> 31:16.475
(both laugh)

31:18.477 --> 31:20.612
Oh, are you planning
on showing off for us?

31:20.646 --> 31:21.680
Yep.

31:21.713 --> 31:23.449
(footfalls thudding)

31:23.482 --> 31:25.584
We have shaven.

31:25.617 --> 31:27.586
Smooth as a baby's bottom.

31:27.619 --> 31:29.455
KEVIN:
Mm-hmm. Hey.

31:29.488 --> 31:31.257
We're supposed to hang it.

31:31.290 --> 31:32.791
You're supposed
to close your eyes.

31:32.824 --> 31:34.994
-KATE: Okay.
-RANDALL: Okay, okay, okay.

31:36.062 --> 31:38.030
-Got the tape.
-(sighs)

31:38.064 --> 31:39.865
REBECCA:
Feeling drowsy today.

31:39.898 --> 31:42.068
-JACK: Yeah, it's a lazy day.
-REBECCA: Mm-hmm.

31:45.004 --> 31:47.739
-They're shaving.
-I know.

31:53.612 --> 31:55.614
Do you remember
sitting here a few years ago,

31:55.647 --> 31:57.583
right on this couch?

31:57.616 --> 31:59.685
Mm-hmm.

32:01.320 --> 32:03.622
You turned out to be a ten,
Jack.

32:04.856 --> 32:07.459
I mean, I would go higher,

32:07.493 --> 32:10.496
but I hate when people say
"on a scale of one to ten,"

32:10.529 --> 32:12.298
and then someone answers "12,"
you know?

32:12.331 --> 32:14.466
There are rules.

32:14.500 --> 32:15.968
You're a 12.

32:16.002 --> 32:17.369
Thank you.

32:18.504 --> 32:20.072
I'm glad
that you acknowledged that.

32:20.106 --> 32:21.640
Of course I acknowledge.

32:23.009 --> 32:25.444
JACK: Okay, guys,
what do you say? (clapping)

32:25.477 --> 32:28.080
-Let's get a blindfold on her.
-REBECCA:
All right, Kate, let's...

32:28.114 --> 32:30.016
-Let's do it!
-Spin her around,
see if she's still got it.

32:30.049 --> 32:31.683
-KEVIN: No, no.
-RANDALL:
I don't think she's gonna do it.

32:31.717 --> 32:33.285
-KATE: I think I do.
-REBECCA: I think she does.

32:33.319 --> 32:34.620
KEVIN: Have you been
practicing in your room

32:34.653 --> 32:36.122
-or something?
-REBECCA:
Don't doubt your sister.

32:36.155 --> 32:38.090
RANDALL: It's been a long time,
okay? I agree with Kevin.

32:38.124 --> 32:39.625
-Come on.
-REBECCA: I have faith in her.

32:39.658 --> 32:41.327
Kate has always...

32:41.360 --> 32:43.029
Whoa.

32:43.062 --> 32:44.696
Hey, Bec, look at that.

32:46.465 --> 32:48.967
-Holy cow.
-Is that thing for real?

32:49.001 --> 32:51.670
Hey, guys, look at that, look.

32:51.703 --> 32:53.372
Babe, maybe there's a...

32:53.405 --> 32:55.974
another family out there
just like ours.

32:56.008 --> 32:57.709
(scoffs)
Yeah.

32:57.743 --> 32:59.478
The Peasings.

32:59.511 --> 33:01.947
And they live in...

33:01.980 --> 33:04.483
-Minnesota.
-(laughs)

33:04.516 --> 33:06.485
And they're very happy.

33:06.518 --> 33:08.487
Yeah, they look very happy.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.456
Hey.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.124
Babe.

33:12.158 --> 33:14.393
Jack, when the world puts
something this obvious

33:14.426 --> 33:16.695
in front of you, you don't
just walk away from it.

33:16.728 --> 33:18.530
You could be...

33:18.564 --> 33:21.133
missing out
on something very important.

33:21.167 --> 33:23.235
Okay.

33:23.269 --> 33:25.737
But I don't think
we're gonna use it much.

33:25.771 --> 33:27.973
-Do you want to use this?
-RANDALL:
Um, what am I doing?

33:28.006 --> 33:29.141
-All right, spin.
-What am I doing?

33:29.175 --> 33:30.709
JACK:
Spin her, spin her, spin her.

33:30.742 --> 33:32.644
REBECCA:
Get her nice and dizzy
and disoriented.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.580
JACK:
Oh, no, spin the other way,
spin the other way!

33:34.613 --> 33:36.415
(all shouting, clamoring)

33:36.448 --> 33:37.916
All right, give her the tail,
give her the tail.

33:37.949 --> 33:40.086
JACK: Can't believe
you guys stopped her...

33:40.119 --> 33:41.653
-REBECCA: Jack.
-JACK: What?

33:41.687 --> 33:43.222
No, I moved around the room.

33:43.255 --> 33:45.091
RANDALL:
Wrong way, wrong way, wrong way.

33:45.124 --> 33:46.492
(all clamoring)

33:46.525 --> 33:48.094
Okay, don't give her any hints,
Randall.

33:48.127 --> 33:49.195
I'm not giving her hints.

33:50.962 --> 33:53.765
There she goes.
(whooping)

33:53.799 --> 33:55.734
Katie girl, no,
are you peeking, what?

33:55.767 --> 33:57.169
-No!
-How do you do that?

33:57.203 --> 33:59.071
Bug, come on, come on,
tell us how you do that.

33:59.105 --> 34:00.606
JACK:
It's crazy.

34:00.639 --> 34:02.441
Before you put the blindfold on,

34:02.474 --> 34:04.276
I look to see
where you guys all are.

34:04.310 --> 34:06.112
And you never shut up.

34:06.145 --> 34:09.115
So as long as I know
where you are,

34:09.148 --> 34:11.217
I always know where I'm going.

34:13.319 --> 34:15.387
Baby girl.

34:21.627 --> 34:23.595
-KATE: Hey.
-Hey.

34:29.168 --> 34:31.170
(Kevin exhales)

34:35.407 --> 34:36.775
KEVIN:
You have
a creepy glow about you.

34:36.808 --> 34:38.043
(laughs)

34:38.076 --> 34:40.779
I got some good news.

34:40.812 --> 34:43.048
I got some very good news

34:43.081 --> 34:45.184
on a very sad day.

34:50.189 --> 34:52.758
(sighs)

34:54.160 --> 34:56.462
We don't have parents anymore.

34:56.495 --> 34:58.564
We still have parents.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.832
You know what I mean, though.

35:00.866 --> 35:03.469
Yeah.

35:03.502 --> 35:05.537
What are we gonna do now?

35:07.606 --> 35:09.708
Like, with our lives?

35:12.478 --> 35:15.113
We're gonna do
what she wanted us to do.

35:15.147 --> 35:17.183
We're gonna live fearlessly.

35:19.117 --> 35:21.153
I'm gonna open up
so many music schools

35:21.187 --> 35:22.821
for the visually impaired
that...

35:22.854 --> 35:25.424
People are gonna start becoming
resentful of blind musicians?

35:25.457 --> 35:26.992
-Exactly.
-Yes.

35:27.025 --> 35:29.127
They're gonna say,
"They have it too good."

35:29.161 --> 35:31.163
(all laugh)

35:33.399 --> 35:36.502
I'm gonna focus
on the nonprofit.

35:38.003 --> 35:39.771
Be home more.

35:39.805 --> 35:41.840
I like my home.

35:42.908 --> 35:45.177
Took me a long time to get it.

35:50.749 --> 35:53.619
DNC wants me to go
to the Iowa state fair.

35:53.652 --> 35:56.488
Shake some hands,
eat some junk food.

35:56.522 --> 35:59.325
Deep-fried Oreos and whatnot.

35:59.358 --> 36:01.360
And, uh...

36:01.393 --> 36:04.363
if the folks who like to
deep-fry their food like you...

36:05.597 --> 36:07.165
...then maybe...

36:09.335 --> 36:11.203
You gonna go?

36:11.237 --> 36:13.071
-I'm weighing it with Beth.
-Mm-hmm.

36:13.104 --> 36:14.940
But, uh, if she's down?

36:17.008 --> 36:19.010
For Mom?

36:20.346 --> 36:23.181
Yeah, for Mom I might go.

36:25.116 --> 36:27.353
(Kate laughs)

36:30.589 --> 36:33.024
Can I tell you guys
my nightmare?

36:36.127 --> 36:38.196
We drift.

36:38.230 --> 36:40.599
With Mom being gone
and our busy lives,

36:40.632 --> 36:42.067
we drift.

36:42.100 --> 36:43.435
And I'm not saying we wind up,

36:43.469 --> 36:44.936
you know,
estranged or anything, but...

36:44.970 --> 36:47.673
We're not gonna drift.

36:47.706 --> 36:50.242
We could drift.

36:58.617 --> 37:01.086
Secret.
(clears throat)

37:01.119 --> 37:03.889
If someone asks me
to close my eyes

37:03.922 --> 37:06.625
and picture my family...

37:06.658 --> 37:09.595
it's not Beth and the girls
I see first.

37:10.996 --> 37:13.131
My first picture is Mom and Dad

37:13.164 --> 37:15.267
and the two of you.

37:17.235 --> 37:20.606
Younger, cuter versions
of you two, but still...

37:21.607 --> 37:24.443
-Same.
-Same.

37:27.646 --> 37:29.648
Guys?

37:31.817 --> 37:33.852
First came?

37:36.288 --> 37:38.123
Me.

37:38.156 --> 37:40.826
-And Dad said?
-Gee.

37:40.859 --> 37:43.261
-And then came?
-Me.

37:43.295 --> 37:45.163
-And Mom said?
-We.

37:45.196 --> 37:46.798
-(chuckles)
-And then came?

37:46.832 --> 37:48.867
Me.

37:49.835 --> 37:51.437
And they said?

37:51.470 --> 37:53.672
That's three.

37:53.705 --> 37:55.607
ALL:
Big Three.

37:57.376 --> 37:59.511
Big Three.

38:05.016 --> 38:07.319
(sighs)

38:09.855 --> 38:11.890
Hey, Kate?

38:14.360 --> 38:17.262
If you drifted...

38:17.295 --> 38:19.731
we'd drift right after you.

38:21.132 --> 38:23.168
Aw.

38:25.236 --> 38:27.038
Can you really drift,
though, Kev?

38:27.072 --> 38:28.707
'Cause I can't remember

38:28.740 --> 38:30.275
if you ever actually
learned how to swim.

38:30.308 --> 38:31.810
(both laugh)

38:31.843 --> 38:33.779
Yeah, well,
I had to learn how to swim.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.547
Growing up with you, all those
tears, I would've drowned.

38:35.581 --> 38:37.649
-Right in the kitchen.
-I'm sorry, I'm just in touch

38:37.683 --> 38:39.451
-with my emotions
unlike some people, Robo-Kev.
-Yeah, I'm just saying,

38:39.485 --> 38:41.653
you know, people don't like
their presidents all weepy

38:41.687 --> 38:44.055
and stuff, you know what I mean,
you got to button that up.

38:48.093 --> 38:50.962
She grabbed my hand.

38:50.996 --> 38:53.031
Hard.

38:53.064 --> 38:54.966
Right at the very end.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.035
You know, right before...

38:58.336 --> 38:59.871
Yeah.

38:59.905 --> 39:01.840
I know, I saw.

39:02.841 --> 39:04.843
I wonder what that was.

39:07.045 --> 39:09.080
(train rattling)

39:16.455 --> 39:18.056
Hey.

39:19.224 --> 39:21.527
Hey.

39:26.131 --> 39:27.566
Mm.

39:32.804 --> 39:35.040
I've missed that little scar.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.276
Come on, you didn't even
notice it for over a decade.

39:38.309 --> 39:41.747
Was too busy looking
at the rest of the face.

39:48.319 --> 39:50.556
I'm scared.

39:50.589 --> 39:52.958
I know.

39:52.991 --> 39:55.761
But don't be.

39:57.729 --> 39:59.698
KEVIN:
Okay.

39:59.731 --> 40:01.700
Let's be honest,
now that I'm shaving,

40:01.733 --> 40:03.735
do I seem more like a man?

40:03.769 --> 40:05.804
-No.
-More like Dad?

40:05.837 --> 40:07.639
-You're getting there.
-I don't know, Kev.

40:07.673 --> 40:09.240
I don't,
I don't really see it yet.

40:09.274 --> 40:11.777
You do know how much
I love you, right, Bec?

40:11.810 --> 40:13.111
Babe?

40:13.144 --> 40:14.446
-JACK: Bec?
-REBECCA: Who, me?

40:14.480 --> 40:16.247
Babe, do you, do you know
how much I love you?

40:16.281 --> 40:18.917
You got, you got to appreciate
the little things, Bec.

40:18.950 --> 40:20.118
Babe, you have said that before.

40:20.151 --> 40:21.453
He was, he was listening
to what I said.

40:21.487 --> 40:23.421
He says it all the time.

40:23.455 --> 40:25.624
-Those are big things...
-No, the little things...

40:25.657 --> 40:27.959
(all clamoring)

40:27.993 --> 40:30.295
-Hey, babe?
-Yeah.

40:30.328 --> 40:32.664
We did good.

40:32.698 --> 40:34.600
You...

40:34.633 --> 40:36.668
did so good.

40:38.504 --> 40:41.006
There was so much left
I wanted to do with them.

40:41.039 --> 40:42.974
You will.

40:43.008 --> 40:45.410
All right, go easy on me.
Oh, boy.

40:45.443 --> 40:48.246
Oh... boy.

40:48.279 --> 40:50.682
(all chatting, clamoring)

40:50.716 --> 40:52.818
What?

40:52.851 --> 40:55.621
It's hard to explain,

40:55.654 --> 40:57.122
but...

40:57.155 --> 40:59.525
you'll do all those things
with them.

40:59.558 --> 41:01.493
*

41:03.729 --> 41:05.597
REBECCA:
Promise?

41:05.631 --> 41:07.599
I do.

41:07.633 --> 41:10.101
I mean, it's not
like I want to be there

41:10.135 --> 41:11.870
for anything weird.

41:11.903 --> 41:14.439
I don't want to watch them
shower or anything.

41:14.472 --> 41:15.974
You won't.

41:16.007 --> 41:17.743
But you'll be there.

41:24.082 --> 41:26.151
*

41:28.353 --> 41:30.656
OTHERS:
Oh!

41:32.524 --> 41:33.959
(all clamoring, laughing)

41:33.992 --> 41:35.827
Oh!

41:35.861 --> 41:37.629
I can't dance.

41:37.663 --> 41:39.197
Just focus on the kids.
No, no, no,

41:39.230 --> 41:40.699
no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

41:40.732 --> 41:42.133
No! No! No! No! No! No!

41:42.167 --> 41:44.636
(laughing, clamoring)

41:44.670 --> 41:46.738
Quite a thing, isn't it?

41:47.939 --> 41:49.875
Us...

41:49.908 --> 41:52.277
finding each other
in that bar that night.

41:53.244 --> 41:55.647
I don't know.

41:55.681 --> 41:57.683
I mean, when the world

41:57.716 --> 42:00.085
puts something that obvious
in front of you,

42:00.118 --> 42:02.487
you don't just walk away.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.556
*

42:05.791 --> 42:08.026
(laughing, clamoring)

42:10.028 --> 42:12.330
Get Randall!
Get Randall! Get Randall!

42:12.363 --> 42:13.932
(Randall shouting)

42:13.965 --> 42:15.533
JACK:
You ready?

42:17.803 --> 42:19.871
I don't want to leave them.

42:19.905 --> 42:22.040
You don't.

42:22.073 --> 42:24.542
You'll see.

42:26.745 --> 42:29.047
I love you.

42:30.248 --> 42:32.283
I love you.

42:42.293 --> 42:52.337
*

42:52.337 --> 43:02.347
