WEBVTT

00:03.300 --> 00:05.100
Ooh, and now it's time
to play

00:05.100 --> 00:06.500
"Who Is Your Perfect Guy?"

00:06.500 --> 00:08.834
Chels, we have seen
every guy here, okay?

00:08.834 --> 00:11.233
Either we need a new
game or a new school.

00:11.233 --> 00:13.200
Ooh, our new
contestant.

00:13.200 --> 00:14.200
Mr. Perfect,

00:14.200 --> 00:15.200
come on down.

00:15.200 --> 00:16.500
Ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding.

00:16.500 --> 00:18.667
You know what?
That's Devon Carter.

00:18.667 --> 00:20.000
Bucktooth Carter?

00:20.000 --> 00:21.300
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

00:21.300 --> 00:23.934
He got his braces off
and his face cleared up.

00:23.934 --> 00:27.500
Ooh, he had
a really good summer.

00:27.500 --> 00:28.900
You're going
to go for it?

00:28.900 --> 00:31.567
Yeah, 'cause I had a good
summer, too-- ooh!

00:34.400 --> 00:37.400
Baxter, you're
breathing my air.

00:37.400 --> 00:40.500
Alana doesn't like
her air breathed.

00:40.500 --> 00:42.834
Alana, when are you just
going to just get over it?

00:42.834 --> 00:45.200
Oh, if you're referring
to what happened,

00:45.200 --> 00:47.400
between you two
in the fourth grade,

00:47.400 --> 00:48.767
Alana's over it.

00:48.767 --> 00:49.967
Good.

00:49.967 --> 00:51.867
Then we never
have to bring it up again.

00:51.867 --> 00:52.967
Right. Right, right.

00:52.967 --> 00:54.200
Because you know what?

00:54.200 --> 00:56.767
It was just a silly play
about dental health, okay?

00:56.767 --> 00:58.100
It was not Raven's fault

00:58.100 --> 00:59.600
that the teacher picked her
to play the tooth fairy

00:59.600 --> 01:01.133
and Alana got stuck
being tooth decay.

01:03.600 --> 01:05.800
Girl, and that
would be bringing it up.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.800
You only got that part
because you were a kiss-up.

01:07.800 --> 01:11.400
<i>iY la maestra no quiere</i>
<i>te ver llorando. Ah!</i>

01:12.567 --> 01:17.000
I got that part because
I<i>was </i>the tooth fairy.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.300
(<i>whimpers </i>)

01:21.300 --> 01:22.734
That's what
the critics said.

01:22.734 --> 01:24.500
I was just repeating
what they said.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.100
Okay, Rae, we all
saw the reviews, okay?

01:26.100 --> 01:28.700
Thank you.
Now it's time to make
your move on Devon Carter.

01:28.700 --> 01:29.734
Stop...
Come on, come on.

01:29.734 --> 01:31.033
Break me off

01:31.033 --> 01:32.500
a piece of that.

01:32.500 --> 01:34.133
What you want me to break?

01:34.133 --> 01:36.667
Loca, chill.

01:36.667 --> 01:39.100
It means I like him.

01:39.100 --> 01:40.834
Which means you
can't have him.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.400
Huh?

01:42.400 --> 01:43.900
(<i>gasps </i>)

01:43.900 --> 01:45.934
Stinky boyfriend stealer!

01:45.934 --> 01:47.000
What did you say
about Alana?

01:47.000 --> 01:49.400
I said, "shneeky
shnoyland shnealer."

01:49.400 --> 01:52.500
It means "Don't hurt me"
in German, please.

01:56.133 --> 01:57.734
Okay, okay, Rae.
You know what?

01:57.734 --> 02:01.967
She may be a "shneeky
shnoyland shnealer,"

02:01.967 --> 02:05.033
but you will always
be the tooth fairy.

02:08.133 --> 02:09.367
Hello, ladies.

02:09.367 --> 02:11.233
Look like we got
a party going on
over here.

02:11.233 --> 02:14.400
Aah, do we know you?

02:14.400 --> 02:16.500
Eddie Thomas,
but you can call me E.T.

02:16.500 --> 02:18.934
because my rap
is out of this world.

02:20.133 --> 02:22.467
Funny.
I like you.

02:26.900 --> 02:28.867
I-I like you, too.

02:28.867 --> 02:31.500
You better.

02:33.467 --> 02:35.500
Yeah, right on.

There's no pleasing you.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.033
William, why don't
you invent a gizmo

03:59.033 --> 04:01.600
to help us meet the ladies?

04:01.600 --> 04:03.000
You mean girls?

04:04.100 --> 04:07.000
Just hearing the word
makes me itchy. Oh!

04:09.767 --> 04:11.700
Okay, you're going
to have to stop that,

04:11.700 --> 04:14.967
'cause you're
making me itchy.

04:15.867 --> 04:18.100
Can you get that for me?

04:21.567 --> 04:23.700
That's good.

04:23.700 --> 04:26.233
Wait, we can
work together.

04:30.700 --> 04:32.200
Aw, that's good.
Right there.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.200
Yeah, a little
to the right.

04:36.967 --> 04:40.600
All right, this
play date is over.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.133
What are you two doing?

04:42.133 --> 04:44.233
I have to cook with these.

04:44.233 --> 04:46.834
William started itching,
then he made me start itching.

04:46.834 --> 04:48.033
What?

04:49.834 --> 04:51.600
Oh, no.

04:52.467 --> 04:53.767
Oh...

04:53.767 --> 04:56.000
Looks like we got a couple
of cases of chickenpox.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.100
Chicken pox?!
Chicken pox?!

04:59.100 --> 05:02.233
Oh, don't worry, guys.
It's no big deal.

05:02.233 --> 05:04.367
Of course, I wouldn't know,
I've never had it.

05:04.367 --> 05:05.834
I must be immune to it.

05:05.834 --> 05:07.734
I mean, I've gone all these
years without ever getting it.

05:07.734 --> 05:09.567
WILLIAM:
And yet
you seem to be

05:09.567 --> 05:11.734
scratching incessantly.

05:11.734 --> 05:13.734
Oh, well, it's nothing.

05:13.734 --> 05:15.467
I mean, I'm just...

05:15.467 --> 05:17.600
covered in spots
that are

05:17.600 --> 05:18.834
really, really itchy,

05:18.834 --> 05:20.867
and I seem to have one
on my back

05:20.867 --> 05:22.367
that I can't really get.

05:22.367 --> 05:23.867
Allow me, sir.

Wait.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.600
Check this out.

05:37.600 --> 05:38.867
Devon Carter

05:38.867 --> 05:40.300
and Alana.

05:40.300 --> 05:41.934
What does she have
that I don't have?

05:41.934 --> 05:43.233
Um, Devon Carter?

05:43.233 --> 05:44.400
Thanks, Chels.

05:48.100 --> 05:49.800
You and me
are going out.

05:49.800 --> 05:50.834
Why me?

05:50.834 --> 05:52.567
Because we got
chemistry.

05:52.567 --> 05:55.834
Close-- we got
biology, third period.

05:55.834 --> 05:58.367
My boy's got jokes.

06:03.467 --> 06:04.734
All right.

06:04.734 --> 06:05.867
Right on.

06:11.900 --> 06:14.567
Watch where I'm going.

06:14.567 --> 06:15.767
Did you
just see that?

06:15.767 --> 06:17.000
Yes.

You, you just
had a vision.

06:26.734 --> 06:29.033
Yeah, I don't...
Oh!

06:30.367 --> 06:31.967
Hey, those tech nerds
are out of control.

06:31.967 --> 06:33.133
You guys, that
was my vision.

06:33.133 --> 06:35.033
One of those carts
is going to slam Alana.

06:35.033 --> 06:36.834
What are you
going to do?

06:39.700 --> 06:41.000
Alana!

was close.

to happen like that.

You made a big mistake,
girlfriend.

Not now, Loca.

07:32.500 --> 07:33.767
Girl... okay.

07:33.767 --> 07:37.000
Rae, you really should
have just let it happen.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.934
I was trying
to do the right thing.

07:38.934 --> 07:40.200
And you did, Rae, you did.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.300
It just, you know,
turned out horribly wrong.

07:48.367 --> 07:49.300
Thanks.

07:49.300 --> 07:50.567
Hi, I'm looking
for Alana.

07:50.567 --> 07:52.200
I just got to apologize
for something

07:52.200 --> 07:53.233
that I did in school.

to get some gum

did to my hair.

I swear...

Darling, uh,

08:56.133 --> 08:57.500
I got to shampoo ya,

08:57.500 --> 09:00.400
so I got to protect
those gorgeous eyes of yours.

09:00.400 --> 09:01.800
All right, here we go.

09:01.800 --> 09:05.567
So, yous was saying something
about this Raven person.

09:05.567 --> 09:07.734
I love the name, doll.
Very exotic.

09:07.734 --> 09:09.000
Sounds like a gem.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.100
Don't even mention
that name in front of me.

now listen to me.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.233
You need to lay back,
lay back

09:19.233 --> 09:21.500
and keep your
eyes closed.

09:21.500 --> 09:22.767

09:22.767 --> 09:24.600
Darling, Wednesdays
are free facials.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.500
Free facials.

09:26.500 --> 09:27.934
Yeah.

09:29.734 --> 09:31.300

09:31.300 --> 09:32.400
All right, okay.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.867
Alls I'm saying is,

09:33.867 --> 09:36.767
sometimes you got to take
the high road and forgive Raven.

I mean, um, you knows whos
for yous knows whats.

09:40.767 --> 09:43.200
All right, now I
got to dry you,

Here we go. Let's go.

09:46.300 --> 09:47.500

closed, darling.

accidents happen.

Yeah, and Raven's going
to have one tomorrow.

Best thing is,
she won't even see it coming.

10:07.300 --> 10:08.667

Who did your roots?

10:24.734 --> 10:25.667
Ooh!

10:25.667 --> 10:26.600
Ah!

10:26.600 --> 10:28.133
<i>iPorque estas esperando...!</i>

10:31.100 --> 10:32.667
We're looking
for Alana.

10:33.567 --> 10:35.200
My hair!

10:35.200 --> 10:37.800
<i>îMira a lo que me a hecho!</i>

10:53.567 --> 10:55.133
Tonya, we're fine.

10:55.133 --> 10:56.867
It's just chickenpox.

10:56.867 --> 10:58.233
Yeah, yeah... no, no, no, no.

10:58.233 --> 11:00.867
William's staying here,
'cause his folks don't want

11:00.867 --> 11:02.300
his little brother
to catch it.

11:02.300 --> 11:04.233
(<i>chuckles </i>):
Yeah. I love you, too.

11:04.233 --> 11:06.200
Yeah, don't worry.
I got everything covered.

11:06.200 --> 11:07.600
Okay, bye.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.867
Corey, what'd I tell you
about scratching with fruit?

11:11.967 --> 11:13.700
Nothing.

11:13.700 --> 11:14.867
Well...

11:14.867 --> 11:17.834
I never really thought
it would come up.

11:27.467 --> 11:29.867
Would you believe
the luck, Dad?

11:29.867 --> 11:30.967
Oh!

11:30.967 --> 11:34.500
Those chickenpox are
super-contagious.

11:34.500 --> 11:37.700
Guess I can't go
to school today.

11:37.700 --> 11:38.800
Nice try.

11:38.800 --> 11:41.200
You had chickenpox
when you were four.

11:42.400 --> 11:43.734
Oh.

11:43.734 --> 11:47.467
Would you believe, um...
turkey pox?

11:47.467 --> 11:48.967
Gobble-gobble!

11:48.967 --> 11:50.500
Ray, sweetheart,
I don't know

11:50.500 --> 11:52.000
what it is
you're trying to avoid,

11:52.000 --> 11:54.700
but eventually, you're going
to have to deal with it.

11:56.400 --> 11:58.567
COREY:
Dad, you said
no scratching

11:58.567 --> 11:59.500
with fruit...

11:59.500 --> 12:02.200
Ah... this is a<i>vegetable.</i>

12:06.033 --> 12:08.000
COREY:
So...

12:08.000 --> 12:10.500
you're trying
to avoid something.

12:10.500 --> 12:12.500
Someone.

12:12.500 --> 12:15.700
I believe we have
the technology to help.

12:17.834 --> 12:19.467
For a price.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.100
Mm-mmm!

12:25.100 --> 12:26.400
Ew, no!

12:26.400 --> 12:29.000
There is no way I am
cleaning this nasty room.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.400
For two weeks?!
You must be crazy.

12:31.400 --> 12:35.767
Okay, but a new set of teeth
cost a whole lot of money.

12:37.200 --> 12:39.967
Okay. How does it work?

12:39.967 --> 12:41.834
It's a simple tracking device.

12:41.834 --> 12:45.000
It'll let us know
where you are
at all times.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.700
And we'll make sure
you and Alana

12:46.700 --> 12:48.600
will never bump
into each other, never.

12:48.600 --> 12:52.200
This is your tracking sensor.

12:52.200 --> 12:55.300
You can implant it
in your flank.

12:57.133 --> 12:58.900
Not going to happen.

12:58.900 --> 13:00.667
Or we can stick it
on your shirt.

13:02.100 --> 13:03.667
Like this?

13:05.500 --> 13:08.400
Now, put this little
speaker in your ear.

13:08.400 --> 13:11.100
We'll be able to warn you
when Alana gets close.

13:11.100 --> 13:13.300
Through a Global Positioning
Satellite,

13:13.300 --> 13:15.767
we can follow your every move
on the computer.

13:15.767 --> 13:18.500
And there's only one
more small thing.

13:18.500 --> 13:22.867
You have to get this other
tracking device on Alana.

13:22.867 --> 13:24.734
What?!

13:24.734 --> 13:26.800
That's too dangerous.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.734
That's crazy.

13:28.734 --> 13:29.734
It's...

13:29.734 --> 13:31.000
Nice to see you, ladies.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.934
Group hug, come, come!

13:32.934 --> 13:34.734
Yeah!

13:34.734 --> 13:36.100
All right.
There you go.

13:36.100 --> 13:37.734
Tough girls need love, too.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.033
I'm outta here. Out!

13:40.233 --> 13:41.467
Who is this clown?

13:41.467 --> 13:44.300
This is Eddie.
He's with me.
He's cool.

13:51.300 --> 13:54.000
Okay, fun's over.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.800
Let's go get Baxter.

13:57.967 --> 13:59.700
Fun?!

14:00.667 --> 14:02.667
Attention, Blue Chicken!

14:02.667 --> 14:05.100
Red Hawk is on the hunt.
Repeat:

14:05.100 --> 14:07.300
(<i>over radio </i>):
Red Hawk is on the hunt.

14:07.300 --> 14:08.667
Chelsea, it's working.

14:08.667 --> 14:11.467
I know. Just a spritz,
and your breath's kissy fresh!

14:11.467 --> 14:12.800
Chelsea, focus.

14:12.800 --> 14:13.967
I just got the word.

14:13.967 --> 14:15.600
Eddie got the sensor on her.

14:15.600 --> 14:16.767
Alana's on the move.

14:16.767 --> 14:17.767
Start moving.

14:17.767 --> 14:20.300
Turn right down the hall.

14:20.300 --> 14:21.867
Come on!

14:21.867 --> 14:23.300
'Scuse me! 'Scuse...

14:24.300 --> 14:26.367
COREY:
Wait!

14:26.367 --> 14:28.133
Now look to your left.

14:30.800 --> 14:31.967
What's he talking about?

14:31.967 --> 14:33.500
There's nothing here
but a candy machine.

14:33.500 --> 14:34.600
COREY:
Now...

14:34.600 --> 14:36.367
put in 50 cents

14:36.367 --> 14:39.934
and get Corey something sweet.

14:39.934 --> 14:42.000
I would coat you like
a sugar-coated...!

14:42.000 --> 14:43.567
Red Hawk's swooping down!

14:43.567 --> 14:45.133
Go, Blue Chicken, go!

14:52.200 --> 14:53.700
She was here.

14:53.700 --> 14:55.400
I can smell it.

14:55.400 --> 14:56.500
(<i>sniffing </i>)

14:56.500 --> 14:58.400
Kissy fresh.

15:10.567 --> 15:11.567
Hey, Devon.

15:11.567 --> 15:12.567
Raven?

15:12.567 --> 15:14.467
Wow, I can't believe it.

15:14.467 --> 15:16.500
You spoke to me twice
in one week?

15:16.500 --> 15:17.600
Why shouldn't I?

15:17.600 --> 15:19.033
I don't know, you know.

15:19.033 --> 15:22.000
Last year, you acted like you
didn't want to be around me.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.600
Oh. Well, I never, ever want
you to feel that way again.

15:25.600 --> 15:27.400
COREY:
Red Hawk closing in!
Gotta go!

15:32.467 --> 15:33.900
There she is.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.900
She's getting closer!

15:41.767 --> 15:43.367
(<i>shoes screeching </i>)

15:58.000 --> 16:00.467
(<i>wheezing </i>)

16:00.467 --> 16:02.500
Chelsea, if we get
out of this, girl,

16:02.500 --> 16:05.233
we really got to do
some more cardio. Chelsea?

16:08.834 --> 16:10.667
(<i>screams </i>)

16:10.667 --> 16:13.367
What is<i>wrong </i>with you?

16:13.367 --> 16:14.800
Well, let's see.
I have flat feet.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.033
Can't really whistle with my...

16:16.033 --> 16:17.600
Can it!

16:17.600 --> 16:19.900
Where's your friend, Raven?

16:19.900 --> 16:21.000
Oh, okay.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.767
Nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-no!

16:22.767 --> 16:24.100
You are not breaking me down,
okay?

16:24.100 --> 16:25.734
(<i>knuckles cracking loudly </i>)

16:25.734 --> 16:28.367
Uh, she went that way.

16:34.100 --> 16:36.500
(<i>beeping </i>)

16:36.500 --> 16:37.400
She's right on you!

16:37.400 --> 16:39.000
COREY:
Get out of there!

16:42.600 --> 16:44.800
(<i>screams </i>)

My bad, fellas!

16:51.000 --> 16:52.667
(<i>screaming </i>)

16:52.667 --> 16:54.400
COREY:
Right on your tail!

16:54.400 --> 16:56.400
Chelsea, come on!

16:58.600 --> 17:01.300
She's closing in.
She can't get any closer.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Oh, come on.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.233
Closet, closet!

17:07.233 --> 17:08.400
Okay.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.934
(<i>grunting </i>)

17:11.934 --> 17:13.100
Chelsea, Chelsea!

17:13.100 --> 17:14.033
What?

17:14.033 --> 17:15.200
Foot!

17:16.033 --> 17:17.400
(<i>panting </i>):
Oh! Oh, Chelsea,

17:17.400 --> 17:20.300
this is the first time
all day that I felt safe.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.400
I know.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.133
Raven, get out of there!
It's not safe!

17:23.133 --> 17:24.700
What is he talking about?

17:24.700 --> 17:26.400
She's right on top of you!

17:27.300 --> 17:28.233
(<i>screaming </i>)

17:28.233 --> 17:29.567
(<i>both screaming </i>)

17:29.567 --> 17:31.600
She's gone.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.300
Yeah.

17:37.467 --> 17:38.867
I'm going to miss her.

17:38.867 --> 17:40.100
Me, too.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.033
Can you pass
the chips?
the chips?

(<i>screaming </i>)

17:51.400 --> 17:54.133
(<i>continue screaming </i>)

17:54.133 --> 17:55.367
(<i>stop screaming </i>)

17:58.867 --> 18:02.000
Why is Alana's sensor on you?

18:02.000 --> 18:03.734
Hmm? Look at that.

18:03.734 --> 18:06.467
You know, that must
have stuck to me

18:06.467 --> 18:08.200
when I bumped into Alana.

18:08.200 --> 18:09.900
(<i>both laugh </i>)

18:09.900 --> 18:11.867
Isn't that funny?

18:11.867 --> 18:13.300
(<i>laughter continues </i>)

18:13.300 --> 18:15.900
Al that running for nothing.

18:15.900 --> 18:17.367
Yeah, that's funny.

18:17.367 --> 18:18.367
Hey, Chels?

18:18.367 --> 18:19.400
Uh-huh?
Get out of my closet.

18:19.400 --> 18:20.500
Okay.

18:25.600 --> 18:26.600
Shh...

18:26.600 --> 18:28.600
Hey there, Raven.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.300
Do you know
what time it is?

18:32.600 --> 18:34.500
A quarter past payback.

18:34.500 --> 18:36.700
Really? Mine
only says<i>ten </i>past.

18:39.367 --> 18:41.200
Alana, listen,
my dad was right, okay?

18:41.200 --> 18:42.700
Alana, that is it.

18:42.700 --> 18:43.734
No more running.

18:43.734 --> 18:45.367
No more
intimidation,
okay?

18:45.367 --> 18:47.300
We have to
settle this.

18:49.300 --> 18:51.967
Okay. I want
to settle this, too.

18:51.967 --> 18:53.100
All right.

18:53.100 --> 18:54.367
Get the stuff.

18:54.367 --> 18:56.033
Stuff?
There's stuff?

18:56.033 --> 18:57.233
Why does there got to be stuff?

18:58.200 --> 19:00.200
Listen, I am not
backing down, Alana.

19:00.200 --> 19:03.767
The only reason I pushed you
yesterday was to help<i>you </i>out.

19:03.767 --> 19:05.200
(<i>scoffs </i>)

19:05.200 --> 19:08.400
Alana says...
(<i>scoffs </i>)

19:08.400 --> 19:10.467
I can't really
explain it, girl,

19:10.467 --> 19:13.500
but I kind of knew that that
nerd cart was going to hit you.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.700
Yeah, right.

19:14.700 --> 19:15.867
What? You're psychic?

19:15.867 --> 19:19.300
<i>¿Tu puedes decir futura?</i>

19:21.934 --> 19:24.734
Well, if I could see
into the<i>futura...</i>

19:24.734 --> 19:26.100
I would know
what the stuff was.

19:26.100 --> 19:28.233
Seriously, girl,
what's in that stuff?

19:29.133 --> 19:31.367
You're about to find out...

19:31.367 --> 19:32.867
right now.

19:33.834 --> 19:34.867
(<i>grunts </i>)

19:40.000 --> 19:41.200
(<i>gasps </i>)

19:41.200 --> 19:43.500
You know what?
This is really weird.

19:43.500 --> 19:44.600
'Cause I didn't
save you this time,

19:44.600 --> 19:45.800
'cause I thought
this time was last time,

19:45.800 --> 19:47.000
and I saved you last time,
'cause I thought

19:47.000 --> 19:48.300
this time was this time,
but I guess it wasn't.

19:48.300 --> 19:50.734
If Alana we're conscious,
she'd say, "What?"

19:52.200 --> 19:53.300
Come on.

19:54.967 --> 19:57.934
Get away from me, Baxter.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.000
You're a jinx.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.100
And you're a bully.

20:02.200 --> 20:04.000
Maybe if you had
a better attitude,

20:04.000 --> 20:05.834
bad things wouldn't
happen to you.

20:05.834 --> 20:07.667
That's crazy.

20:07.667 --> 20:08.734
Is it?

20:08.734 --> 20:10.233
I mean, think about it.

20:10.233 --> 20:12.300
We used to be friends, Alana.

20:12.300 --> 20:14.600
Now, maybe if you let
go of some of that anger

20:14.600 --> 20:16.867
you're harboring,
we could be friends again.

20:16.867 --> 20:19.400
You and me friends?

20:19.400 --> 20:22.700
It's better than getting
smushed every day.

20:24.100 --> 20:25.800
So, what do you say?

20:25.800 --> 20:27.367
Truce?

20:27.367 --> 20:30.100
Okay, whatever.

20:30.100 --> 20:31.500
Oh, you guys!

20:32.900 --> 20:34.400
Oh... gosh.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.367
This is a beautiful moment.

20:36.367 --> 20:38.900
You know what? I bet one day,
you two will look back on this

20:38.900 --> 20:41.300
and laugh about all the
funny stuff that went down.
Yeah.

20:41.300 --> 20:43.367
(<i>all laughing </i>)

Let me handle
this for you.

21:04.667 --> 21:06.600
Chelsea, come with me!

21:19.233 --> 21:21.133
Hey, boyfriend!

21:21.133 --> 21:22.934
Hey, girl!

21:22.934 --> 21:24.934
I didn't even see you
standing there.

21:24.934 --> 21:26.500
Stop lying.

21:27.567 --> 21:30.967
Listen, it's really cool
that you like me.

21:32.200 --> 21:35.200
And as painful as it is
for me to say this,

21:35.200 --> 21:37.900
I really think that maybe
we should just be friends.

21:43.300 --> 21:44.467
That okay?

21:44.467 --> 21:46.967
Yeah. We can be friends.

21:46.967 --> 21:48.300
I'm cool with that.

21:48.300 --> 21:50.500
Hey, great.
So, I'll see you around.

21:50.500 --> 21:51.400
See you around...

21:52.300 --> 21:53.400
...buddy!

21:57.300 --> 21:59.300
(<i>weakly </i>):
Bye.
